[00:02.06]Wait!
[00:02.30]Hold on!
[00:02.66]Wait a second!
[00:03.44]Excuse me!
[00:04.10]Excuse me!
[00:04.70]Abort!
[00:05.14]Abort!
[00:05.46]Bloody Trapland 2 has added a new map.
[00:09.00]Excuse me.
[00:10.94]Etalyx.
[00:12.18]Etalyx!
[00:13.78]He's not here.
[00:15.37]Where is he?
[00:17.87]Bloody Trapland 2.
[00:28.63]Shit, I uninstalled the game.
[00:29.61]Does that mean I can't do it?
[00:36.39]Hey, unmute yourself, idiot.
[00:37.93]What do you mean, unmute myself?
[00:39.25]I'm muted?
[00:39.89]Yeah, you've been muted this whole time.
[00:41.75]What do you mean, this whole time?
[00:43.55]Since you killed me, you muted yourself, and you haven't unmuted since.
[00:48.37]Shut up.
[00:50.13]I'm serious.
[00:50.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:51.23]Since I shot you, I've been muted the whole time.
[00:54.80]You killed me.
[00:55.70]I said, was it worth it?
[00:56.72]You said, no, and then you muted.
[01:00.38]That was the last time I heard you.
[01:02.84]So, what were you doing this whole time?
[01:05.80]I was waiting for you to... I don't know what you were doing, so I was just waiting.
[01:10.06]More importantly, Bloody Trapland 2 has new levels.
[01:12.98]Really?
[01:13.42]Here we go.
[01:13.86]Bingo.
[01:14.66]Open it.
[01:19.18]I uninstalled it.
[01:20.08]Hopefully it is a Steam cloud for this.
[01:25.60]And so it doesn't reset all of our save quality.
[01:29.39]Otherwise, that might just be it.
[01:32.91]I need my controller.
[01:35.41]Bloody Trapland 2, Curiosity.
[01:38.15]Curiosity killed the cat.
[01:40.27]Don't.
[01:40.65]Why?
[01:41.32]What do you mean, why?
[01:43.40]I need to say that.
[01:46.22]Let's just leave it unsaid.
[01:47.36]Why?
[01:48.38]What are you talking about?
[01:51.90]It's like a fill-the-air sentence.
[01:54.20]I know it is.
[01:54.52]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[01:56.10]I'm trying to fill the air.
[01:58.66]You're like downloading 340 megabytes.
[02:01.26]Oh, by the way, I have to go over here.
[02:03.62]Because I have to sit in a different spot.
[02:07.44]Alright, let's do... Everything's fine, don't worry.
[02:13.18]Okay.
[02:15.08]Oh, I need my controller.
[02:16.50]Options, resolution, visual quality, gore on.
[02:21.10]Turn it down just a little bit.
[02:23.65]I know it's a black screen, just give me a moment.
[02:28.56]Play, uh, Online Lobby.
[02:33.06]And, um, alright.
[02:35.23]Sounds good, man.
[02:40.37]Does this game exist on Twitch?
[02:42.67]It does.
[02:52.77]Okay.
[02:53.51]I am ready to join Etalyx' game.
[02:56.31]This is the quality content that I watch for.
[02:58.81]This was fun.
[03:00.95]This was a fun stream.
[03:03.05]Let me play this.
[03:06.13]Online lobby.
[03:08.14]Host.
[03:08.34]And then host.
[03:08.94]I'm going to do join game.
[03:09.96]Invite only.
[03:11.84]Yep.
[03:13.74]By the way, more players online in Bloody Trapland 2 than Lawbreakers.
[03:18.22]There are 51 people playing this right now.
[03:19.84]How many people are in Lawbreakers right now?
[03:25.48]So we're going back to Lawbreaker, okay.
[03:27.41]I guess.
[03:28.55]Well, more players than are in Paragon right now.
[03:34.87]Let's get Bloody Tripline 2.
[03:36.23]There it is.
[03:39.28]And did it work?
[03:40.12]Can you see it on the screen?
[03:41.10]Yes, you can.
[03:41.78]Alright, so I'm going to be red.
[03:42.78]I see you.
[03:43.46]Yeah, I'll be green.
[03:45.26]So, did our progress save?
[03:49.10]Don't know.
[03:51.00]Did you have this game installed or no?
[03:52.95]No.
[03:54.99]Oh...
[03:57.05]That is the correct response.
[03:58.71]Oh.
[03:59.67]Wait.
[04:00.85]Wait a minute.
[04:05.42]This is 1.13.
[04:06.48]Alright, so it did save.
[04:08.42]It did?
[04:08.68]I think.
[04:09.54]No, it didn't.
[04:09.80]These are all locked.
[04:11.74]Are they?
[04:12.74]Yeah, they all have lock symbols.
[04:14.84]2, 1.
[04:14.88]Yeah, we can't go here.
[04:15.82]These are locked.
[04:17.86]Where the fuck are you?
[04:21.46]This is not locked.
[04:22.42]I just joined the first one I saw.
[04:24.72]We already did this, though.
[04:25.42]Didn't we already beat this level?
[04:26.18]Alright, let's leave.
[04:26.72]Go left.
[04:27.32]I know.
[04:27.50]That's what I'm saying.
[04:28.90]They're not locked.
[04:29.50]They're locked for me?
[04:30.23]Yeah, we already did that.
[04:35.47]We were on the ice level.
[04:36.15]We did the ice level, right?
[04:37.09]Okay.
[04:37.33]I was just seeing if they were locked or not, so I was seeing if I could join one.
[04:40.43]We're not going to replay this whole game.
[04:42.15]We already did it.
[04:42.79]Go what?
[04:43.77]There's videos of it.
[04:46.73]Now, these are locked.
[04:47.77]These are locked, but it was...
[04:56.54]I think we already did the ice levels, didn't we?
[04:58.66]We did part of ice.
[04:59.48]They had a stopping point, like here.
[05:02.40]So this is the last one we did.
[05:05.64]Hey, don't you just love... You know how hard this is going to be, like jumping into level three?
[05:09.94]Yep.
[05:10.62]It's going to be impossible.
[05:12.80]What are the moves?
[05:14.22]I think we did this one.
[05:15.19]This is the last one we did, and there was no... There was no way to go forward.
[05:19.77]Yeah.
[05:21.30]Okay, let's do it.
[05:23.10]By the way, this is like world three.
[05:24.50]Hopefully your jumping and platforming skills are top notch.
[05:27.86]I don't even know the buttons.
[05:30.03]It's like right trigger to dodge.
[05:31.91]You gotta jump from here to here.
[05:39.25]I think there was like a secret though.
[05:40.77]Yeah, there was a secret here though.
[05:42.21]Well, it was a secret to just drop right down.
[05:49.76]Was there?
[05:50.04]Oh, okay.
[05:51.66]Yeah, I see.
[05:52.34]Right there.
[05:52.98]Right between the eyes.
[05:56.19]Never mind.
[05:56.57]I don't think you're supposed to be able to go down there.
[05:59.59]But we did.
[06:00.17]Yeah, thank that one guy here that said that there was more levels here.
[06:04.53]Alright, you go first.
[06:05.99]You have to go from the snow cone to snow cone.
[06:12.12]And by the way, I am getting some serious lag.
[06:26.52]He's doing the thing that it's like, whoa, you're gonna, it's definitely not good enough for this.
[06:34.18]How did you get up there?
[06:34.80]Oh, wow.
[06:39.33]Uh, I don't, why don't I just, oh, the Christmas tree electrocutes you.
[06:43.53]Wait, it does?
[06:43.83]It's gonna electrocute you?
[06:44.65]How fast is it?
[06:45.11]How far?
[06:47.33]Uh, that far.
[06:49.55]That far?
[06:52.18]So you have to go straight from it to the ice cubes and the other ice.
[06:55.42]Oh, what the hell?
[07:05.22]That's not that bad.
[07:11.42]Oh, you... What are you thinking, man?
[07:13.02]What am I doing?
[07:13.56]I don't even... I don't think I was supposed to make that, but it worked.
[07:24.61]One of the time, you... No, you go first.
[07:28.01]Watch out for the Christmas tree.
[07:28.77]It's about to light up.
[07:30.73]Ooh.
[07:31.31]Ooh.
[07:32.41]And we can go.
[07:35.14]We have a winner.
[07:37.18]Look, those are all the deaths.
[07:39.00]It actually counts, though.
[07:40.36]That's a new update.
[07:41.04]I only died... I only died... I didn't die one time.
[07:47.94]What?
[07:50.02]Okay.
[07:51.42]Why does it keep flashing back to jungle before we start the new... Because the game's not done.
[07:56.99]When will it be done?
[07:58.69]That's a great question.
[07:59.61]What's with the barrel?
[08:00.87]Oh, you need to use it.
[08:02.79]How?
[08:03.49]You're an ice cube.
[08:04.83]Bye.
[08:05.03]You probably have to jump from there to the other side.
[08:08.47]Well, you fell down.
[08:11.89]Well, it's doing that thing where I can't see the barrel move when you're standing on top of it.
[08:15.91]Well, I made it.
[08:18.75]Watch out for the... that.
[08:21.13]The thing that you went right into.
[08:23.12]Oh, you mean the cannibal?
[08:24.20]Watch out for the fish.
[08:27.82]I jumped right into it.
[08:28.56]Come on.
[08:31.74]Is this live?
[08:32.38]Yes, this is live.
[08:33.84]At least, I think it is.
[08:34.54]I hope it is.
[08:38.23]Oh, I took the hit for you.
[08:42.95]I don't understand how to do this consistently.
[08:51.04]I don't... You gotta go down and then... Okay, I see.
[08:53.36]No, I don't see.
[08:54.86]You gotta jump over it like this.
[08:56.08]Ready?
[08:56.94]Watch this.
[08:57.28]You're gonna get it in three.
[09:05.47]Fuck.
[09:09.71]Like I hit my head on the top of the first one.
[09:15.45]You gotta go from here.
[09:18.37]One more cycle and then I think it's gonna be good.
[09:20.83]Right now.
[09:23.76]Go!
[09:25.92]Oh, that's close, that's how you do it.
[09:28.84]That's how you do it!
[09:29.58]That's how you do it, but it didn't work.
[09:31.28]And you gotta go up and then to the barrel, to the barrel.
[09:36.86]Just keep walking immediately into the cannon.
[09:45.33]Don't count the deaths, give me a break.
[09:48.67]The game does that for you.
[09:51.51]At least I acknowledge the game, the views tanking.
[09:58.29]Give us some credit here.
[10:00.50]We're supposed to do this after like three hours of playing Bloody Trap Land.
[10:06.87]We both haven't played this game in like fucking five months.
[10:10.09]It's been at least probably six months.
[10:12.10]Alright, there we go.
[10:20.06]I need to wait.
[10:21.42]One more cycle.
[10:21.94]I haven't even made it up there yet.
[10:30.55]That's what you have to do.
[10:31.21]There it is, finally.
[10:32.25]Alright, what are you supposed to do?
[10:33.79]Okay.
[10:35.21]You roll the barrel down.
[10:38.05]Watch out for the piranha.
[10:38.85]Oh, you fucking dumb game!
[10:39.99]Fuck!
[10:42.83]You gotta make that jump!
[10:43.87]That's what you have to do.
[10:47.77]Watch what you do.
[10:49.70]You have to wait for after this one.
[10:51.34]Now you go, now it's time to go.
[10:53.06]Wait for the piranha.
[10:55.80]I'm gonna get hit.
[11:06.03]You saw that the theory is there.
[11:08.48]I'm not sure it's there in practice, though.
[11:16.64]Help me.
[11:17.70]Help me.
[11:18.62]I don't know where to go.
[11:19.36]How do you get to this barrel in the middle of the water?
[11:25.29]I guess you have to lay out for it.
[11:27.09]Yeah, you can do the flying squirrel.
[11:32.31]I understand.
[11:36.33]Got it.
[11:36.63]Okay.
[11:37.07]What the fuck is that?
[11:37.91]No, there's spikes there.
[11:39.31]Oh, that's so... Oh, my God.
[11:40.85]That's horrible.
[11:41.81]There are spikes.
[11:42.49]Okay, that right side with the barrel.
[11:44.91]Watch those spikes.
[11:46.05]You're going to have to beat this one for me because it's like first part is... I got another idea.
[11:51.45]Oh, that's so irritating.
[11:52.56]I didn't even see it.
[11:53.42]Here, jump on me.
[11:56.84]This is not going to work.
[11:58.56]Yes, it is.
[12:03.88]It's actually going to be hard to get up there again.
[12:06.41]Pro strats.
[12:08.09]Oh, please.
[12:08.65]I jumped over it.
[12:09.49]I did.
[12:10.25]I did.
[12:10.57]I swear.
[12:11.43]Run it back.
[12:13.14]You'll see.
[12:29.16]It is this first part.
[12:30.10]I just want to be like past the first part.
[12:31.64]The last level was significantly easier.
[12:36.48]I didn't do that.
[12:37.18]I did not do that on purpose.
[12:38.56]Did I help at least?
[12:39.64]I just fucked myself.
[12:45.03]It's really not even that big of a deal.
[12:46.41]Alright, next attempt.
[12:51.19]You do it this time.
[12:53.13]Waiting for the fish.
[12:53.75]I have no idea what the hell to do when you get over there though.
[13:02.97]Dude if you jump on top of the barrel does the barrel like rise again?
[13:07.49]Why did that why did I miss that one?
[13:13.17]God The answer is yes, yes, it does I hit my head on the fucking Fucking God give me a break And now we both are fucked
[13:29.52]Just a question of if you can get on top.
[13:35.68]I didn't do it, apparently.
[13:36.70]Didn't fucking do it, apparently.
[13:37.66]The glide doesn't work half the fucking time.
[13:43.98]Like that?
[13:44.39]This is gonna be a short, uh, bloody trap land stream.
[13:52.99]Bloody fucking trap land.
[13:54.35]Play the new levels, they said.
[14:01.86]Why?
[14:02.40]God, why is that?
[14:04.98]Why?
[14:05.46]I did it.
[14:09.30]I did it.
[14:09.76]I think the issue is wall jumping off of it while it's like sinking underwater.
[14:14.33]Fucking God.
[14:26.11]Now what?
[14:27.39]Good luck.
[14:29.13]This is the part where we... Wow, you almost got hit.
[14:32.81]Is there a secret under there?
[14:34.23]Just wait, just wait.
[14:35.37]Just look.
[14:36.15]Just wait.
[14:37.07]Just give it a look.
[14:38.43]Just stand right there.
[14:40.43]It looks like there's a secret cave under the wall.
[14:45.99]God damn, dude.
[14:47.01]I'm about to throw this controller out the fucking window.
[14:49.67]We've been playing for ten minutes.
[14:57.13]There is nothing over there, unfortunately.
[15:00.07]I did the same fucking thing again!
[15:07.62]Alright, you just have to commit.
[15:14.83]You got it, I believe.
[15:20.07]How could... Alright, I'm missing something with the dash.
[15:22.33]Like, why does it just not activate half the time you use it?
[15:25.74]Is there like a perfect time you have to use that dash for it to work?
[15:30.12]Am I crazy or what?
[15:31.78]Yeah, there is like a perfect time.
[15:32.94]Oh god, you have to go.
[15:49.48]Come on!
[15:50.48]There is a secret under there, but I have no idea how to get under there.
[15:52.76]We're going for level completion here, buddy.
[15:55.72]Oh my god, I hate it.
[15:56.86]What was the thing where we rolled dice again?
[16:05.25]That sounds like more fun.
[16:09.23]Hold on.
[16:19.05]What happens when you get to the very top?
[16:20.55]I don't know.
[16:22.13]You uninstall the fucking game.
[16:23.47]This level's significantly harder than the last one.
[16:33.74]Oh, it's the dice game again.
[16:37.13]I swear.
[16:38.27]Get me up there, you fucking idiot!
[16:41.83]Okay, I'm here.
[16:42.93]Just hold on.
[16:43.75]Don't do anything drastic.
[16:44.78]Don't do anything drastic.
[16:45.52]I'm standing right here.
[16:46.08]Okay.
[16:46.20]I'm fine.
[16:46.46]I'm fine.
[16:46.90]I'm fine.
[16:47.08]Alright, get up here.
[16:47.74]Okay, so what you have to do is somehow wall jump when it goes up off the right side.
[16:52.76]Alright, well, just you're making me nervous.
[16:53.94]Get up here.
[17:01.89]Okay, well, so let me see here.
[17:04.61]Is there anything that's dangerous over there?
[17:15.99]Okay, I get it.
[17:19.21]I don't!
[17:19.63]I did!
[17:19.93]I did, but it was... Oh, Farkle, you!
[17:25.10]Farkle, you.
[17:26.50]Hey, careful.
[17:28.24]I'm just... I'm burning it.
[17:29.40]I'm burning it.
[17:41.38]What do I do?
[17:43.31]Okay, you've got further than both of us now.
[17:48.50]don't understand I'll wait I don't know how to get okay you have to somehow go to the ice to the left okay so but you're gonna bump your head here you're gonna slide off the ice to the left so there's nothing to stop you so you're gonna stop yourself oh my god then you have to jump from the ice off of the blue and wall jump glide over the two spikes
[18:10.20]in the top middle before the cannonball hits you.
[18:13.37]But if I jump from here, I'm gonna bump my head on this spike with the wooden plank.
[18:19.23]Theoretically, yes.
[18:23.81]Oy, I got it!
[18:25.15]I did- I didn't do the dash.
[18:26.24]You have to dash from there.
[18:27.52]I would have had it too.
[18:28.14]Yeah, you have to dash.
[18:31.22]Fuck.
[18:43.31]That's what you gotta do, and I'm not doing it.
[18:47.01]I can't even go, I can't even go past this stupid part in the beginning.
[18:52.41]I'm too scared of this.
[18:55.11]I have to go left.
[19:05.14]I like how we've mastered the beginning.
[19:08.50]I didn't!
[19:19.37]Okay, my turn to be up here and play.
[19:20.91]Hey, go for it.
[19:21.97]What do you do?
[19:22.43]Do you bump your head?
[19:23.91]You have to just jump to the ice, jump up, jump over to that wall jump dash.
[19:28.44]Do you fall off of this spot, or do you jump from this spot?
[19:30.96]No, you jump from that spot.
[19:32.52]So it doesn't bump your head?
[19:33.78]Nope.
[19:34.46]I mean, it kind of does, but you still get it.
[19:35.98]Then you jump on the side of that one, up to the top of the ice, jump over to the left, wall jump dash.
[19:40.98]I don't think I'm going to make the first jump.
[19:45.92]What happened to you?
[19:46.99]Did you fall down?
[19:48.19]I hit the spikes on the way down.
[19:53.21]Let's get the fish.
[19:53.89]Nope.
[20:04.40]Holy shit, that... I don't... That's gonna take some severe concentration to do that one.
[20:13.60]Well, there's a cannonball on top of everything else.
[20:15.52]I don't understand if, like, maybe... I feel like the dash... How do you... The dash doesn't seem to be working that well from there.
[20:21.82]Your character is acting strange.
[20:24.34]Oh, please.
[20:27.50]Whoops.
[20:29.52]Whoops.
[20:36.90]Hi.
[20:37.72]Hi.
[20:40.70]See you soon.
[20:46.62]What the fuck?
[20:47.48]Ah, it's because I slipped.
[20:48.62]I slid the other direction.
[20:50.66]My sweaty hands made me go the other direction.
[21:06.67]Alright.
[21:07.47]Hey, thanks for watching the stream, everybody.
[21:08.97]That's going to be the end.
[21:11.10]I ain't going to sit here.
[21:13.22]We've already been sitting here for like six hours.
[21:15.72]We haven't been playing this game for six hours.
[21:18.12]Playing Bloody Trap Land after five and a half hours stream is maybe wasn't the best idea.
[21:24.70]I don't even know how I didn't get hit there.
[21:35.27]Holy fuck!
[21:35.97]What did I do?
[21:36.73]Okay, I got it.
[21:37.31]I'm gonna win.
[21:40.23]I won.
[21:40.51]Oh, what the fuck?
[21:45.35]What did you hit?
[21:46.11]Did you hit the snowman?
[21:53.15]There are spikes.
[21:54.52]Where?
[21:55.10]Under the snow?
[21:56.60]Look at the place to run to go to the end of the level.
[22:00.08]Oh, you ran right into it.
[22:02.26]I just walked into them.
[22:03.42]I thought that was the end of the level.
[22:04.48]I thought that was it.
[22:14.72]I guess that's what I get for not paying attention to the game.
[22:20.54]What the fuck?
[22:21.35]You're gonna get hit by the fish.
[22:25.95]You're so funny.
[22:26.65]You're so funny.
[22:27.57]What a funny guy.
[22:28.39]I guess I fucking rushed.
[22:33.53]Did I really rush or was I just not paying attention?
[22:39.68]I think it's the latter of those two things.
[22:46.00]Oh, why can I not do this now?
[22:49.24]Gotta be quick.
[22:49.68]It's gotta be bang, bang, dash.
[22:51.64]There you go.
[22:52.64]Ooh.
[22:53.84]Is there a platform I thought I had to jump across for some reason?
[22:59.92]I can't fucking believe it.
[23:00.80]The level is just over.
[23:01.80]Except for the one extra little extra piece.
[23:06.22]Hey, careful.
[23:07.08]One extra piece.
[23:12.62]You gotta move.
[23:13.36]You gotta go.
[23:14.34]Got it.
[23:15.55]Nice, okay, you go first.
[23:32.02]No, your turn.
[23:33.12]I landed on the one spot that had the spikes.
[23:35.82]The one place I couldn't land.
[23:38.18]The one fucking spot that did not allow me to land.
[23:47.57]Can you get out, please?
[23:51.24]You were saying?
[23:52.84]It's not even that big of a deal.
[23:54.48]These games are so painful.
[23:56.32]Because this shit's not even that big of a deal, but it just, in practice, is so difficult to do.
[24:01.74]Okay, from here.
[24:04.94]From here, you have to just jump in there, slide.
[24:07.66]Do you eagle glide in?
[24:09.81]Just slide in there, just don't go too far.
[24:13.41]You have to eagle glide in there, and then just don't step on the fucking spike.
[24:18.02]Just jump over that spike.
[24:19.10]That's all you got to do and we can be done.
[24:20.42]But what about the other spike?
[24:21.80]It's on the roof.
[24:22.98]Just don't hit that spike and you're good to go.
[24:25.18]Jump over that spike and we can be done.
[24:26.38]We can keep going.
[24:27.60]We can go.
[24:29.74]I did it.
[24:31.73]It was me.
[24:32.59]Two in a row.
[24:33.21]Wow.
[24:33.37]115.
[24:33.39]117 deaths.
[24:37.39]Alright, so we're going to keep going?
[24:48.23]Spiky Peaks.
[25:03.51]I feel like these do something.
[25:04.75]I don't know what's happening.
[25:05.41]I'm just going.
[25:08.31]Jump?
[25:09.97]Onto them?
[25:11.29]How does this work?
[25:16.11]Um...
[25:19.38]Can you go over here?
[25:20.02]I don't know.
[25:22.74]What hit you?
[25:24.90]Why'd you die?
[25:26.98]I believe this is a client-side... This client-side box... My stomach hurts.
[25:39.89]I just had to flap my wings, man.
[25:41.77]What?
[25:42.05]Okay, you don't do that.
[25:43.23]You do not want to touch those.
[25:44.25]I thought you had to jump, like wall jump off those balls.
[25:47.50]That's not what you do.
[25:48.58]How do you beat the wooden boxes up there?
[25:53.26]Wooden boxes?
[25:54.14]What the fuck are you talking about?
[25:55.08]You're not hitting any wooden boxes in that tunnel on the left?
[25:58.83]There must be client side.
[25:59.81]Because right now you're being squished by boxes.
[26:01.97]No, there are no boxes here.
[26:03.65]Well, that's why that hallway is there, is because there are actually wooden boxes.
[26:07.99]Holy fucking my face.
[26:09.33]Okay.
[26:10.61]What do I do from here?
[26:11.17]Uh, it looks like you... Where's the exit?
[26:16.50]Exit's on top.
[26:17.74]But what's down to the right there?
[26:18.74]Is there a button I can press?
[26:21.58]Yeah, I'm gonna get the button.
[26:30.85]Spikes?
[26:31.35]No?
[26:31.89]Where's the... Okay, get the button.
[26:34.76]Now you're being squished by others.
[26:36.29]You just got squished by a giant wall like four times.
[26:40.89]The traps are not here since I'm hosting for you.
[26:43.95]Alright.
[26:44.49]Well, what did the button do?
[26:46.81]It's... What is that button doing?
[26:50.26]You're getting squashed by an Indiana Jones style like wall that moves in on you.
[26:54.24]Right, but when I press that button, what is that doing?
[26:57.24]There's a button on top.
[26:59.38]I just pressed it.
[27:01.92]I have no clue.
[27:02.60]Oh, there's a timer.
[27:06.12]I don't see any other changes.
[27:07.42]Looks like this is going to be breakable.
[27:18.34]I don't know.
[27:18.60]I don't know where to go from here now.
[27:20.10]What do I do now?
[27:22.52]I'm stuck here.
[27:25.62]I so badly wanted to press the button.
[27:27.88]It's as good as mine.
[27:28.88]I think what you're supposed to do since the arrow is pointing up is once you get to that top layer.
[27:36.05]is jump off the uh snowballs I mean I I jumped off one of the snowballs and got to that's how I got over there I hate this level because it's hard it's it's twice as hard it's like I'm playing with a handicap right now yeah you're playing with extra you're playing to get with extra pitfalls
[28:09.33]I had it too.
[28:10.55]Wow, you still made it.
[28:12.11]Yeah, but I can't do anything from here.
[28:16.61]How do you time that?
[28:18.56]You just gotta do it.
[28:19.44]You gotta just time it right, I guess.
[28:21.24]I did it once already.
[28:24.70]Not that one, right?
[28:30.62]They go down so much faster than you.
[28:33.69]I got it.
[28:33.95]Okay.
[28:35.79]Well, that... Okay.
[28:38.17]I didn't expect the wood to fall.
[28:40.85]Fucking kaizo block.
[28:43.65]It just falls.
[28:44.65]I'm like struggling.
[28:46.84]There's one box, I swear.
[28:50.42]See?
[28:50.90]What even killed you, dude?
[29:03.72]oh yeah I can't do it anymore I think I'm done I don't think I can do it anymore well if you can't do it on easy hold on wait wait wait wait it's just I'm jumping over it I can't even make the first obstacle how do you play this game with four people at the same time very carefully
[29:40.12]Now what?
[29:40.46]How do you get to the top rope?
[29:41.80]You have to get to the top rope.
[29:44.00]Where you are right now, I guess... Whoops.
[29:45.86]Maybe you can jump from there to see where the tree is.
[29:48.30]The second tree on the right.
[29:49.18]No, I have to do the actual obstacle.
[29:50.76]I don't even know what I just did.
[29:54.36]What the fuck happened?
[29:55.42]I didn't even touch anything.
[29:56.20]Did I just double jump in the air?
[29:59.04]That made no sense.
[30:06.90]Oh, I almost had it.
[30:12.47]Why do I do that to myself?
[30:14.71]Why did I jump again?
[30:15.97]I was already there.
[30:18.05]I don't understand myself.
[30:21.90]It's like my brain is delayed.
[30:23.94]Jump now.
[30:28.04]How did you get up there?
[30:29.66]I've jumped off the snowball.
[30:31.30]Oh, you did like a second jump?
[30:33.00]Yeah, I did like a snowball falling wall jump.
[30:35.83]I see.
[30:36.15]And this is a dead... That platform falls.
[30:40.09]That platform falls, yes.
[30:42.93]Alright, so yeah, it has to be like this.
[30:45.94]Alright, we're good.
[30:47.86]Did it fall for you?
[30:49.12]Yes, but you have to jump when it's on... Let's just truck that up because the level was broken.
[30:54.56]Who cares?
[30:57.36]All that matters is I got almost there.
[30:59.90]Almost there.
[31:00.28]It's close.
[31:08.98]Jerm is slowly draining blood and losing power.
[31:13.78]Why am I draining blood?
[31:19.42]Okay, we just melded together there.
[31:20.88]I was experimenting here with the different ways.
[31:26.76]Okay, that's interesting.
[31:31.46]Oh, spikes on top.
[31:37.21]Hmm.
[31:38.59]I wonder if you just don't... Don't even jump off the wall?
[31:44.95]Yeah, I don't think you jump off the wall.
[31:46.19]I think you just have to do it really slow.
[31:53.15]Yep.
[31:53.87]Don't even freak out and jump.
[31:55.11]Just kind of let it happen.
[31:56.43]Just left to right.
[31:58.76]No, what the hell is this?
[32:02.86]It is a... probably another client-side trap that I'm gonna have to... I don't see anything here.
[32:08.98]Well, there's something here.
[32:10.98]Yeah, what is it?
[32:13.10]It's like a big spike wall that moves.
[32:16.01]Oh, a big spike wall that moves, huh?
[32:18.17]Wow, look at that.
[32:19.17]That's fucking tough.
[32:20.99]I better be careful against that spike wall.
[32:25.87]I made it.
[32:26.88]I did okay.
[32:38.50]Let's go.
[32:38.96]I love how you get extra traps.
[32:43.02]I do get extra traps.
[32:47.72]It's okay, though.
[32:48.30]It still counts in the end.
[32:50.06]So this is the bonus level.
[32:53.16]No, this is level 9.
[32:55.18]Isn't the boss behind us?
[32:57.98]Oh, I guess that's right.
[32:58.96]Is this bonus, though?
[33:00.26]I think so.
[33:01.28]The boss is behind us.
[33:08.19]Hmm.
[33:09.29]It's just barely thick enough.
[33:15.80]Uh, nope, you don't ju- I think the cord, I think, kills you too.
[33:24.00]I got, yeah, I got scared.
[33:24.94]There we go, yeah, you just have to go down past it.
[33:31.45]I do actually have saw blades now.
[33:32.99]Oh my
[33:35.89]How far does that go?
[33:37.59]Right here.
[33:38.19]Oh, I'm scared of this.
[33:45.75]You can go to the left and press the button.
[33:53.25]Why would I do something that dumb?
[33:55.33]Why would I do that?
[33:56.57]Why did I just do that?
[33:58.07]So you see the saw blade right here moving underneath me, right?
[34:00.93]Okay.
[34:02.11]Just checking.
[34:03.41]I don't know what's real anymore.
[34:08.27]I'm going to wait for you to be done with that because that's tricky.
[34:11.02]Where do you go after this?
[34:12.32]I was going to try to go left, but watch out for the rocks.
[34:15.84]There's a big button there.
[34:23.35]Oh, there's wind.
[34:26.21]Who won't you go?
[34:33.15]The rocks are rolling over you on my screen.
[34:35.13]Woo!
[34:35.84]Oh, shit, I can't even go in here.
[34:37.32]You have to open the door.
[34:38.00]You have to press the button.
[34:41.58]Wow, come on, man, come on!
[34:43.84]Press that button and I will meat boy the hell out of this.
[34:46.46]Wait, what happened?
[34:47.58]Step on it again?
[34:48.00]Push the button.
[34:49.22]What did it do?
[34:50.44]It revealed the entire hallway for me.
[34:53.80]Huh?
[34:56.10]It didn't open this door?
[34:57.08]There's no hallway there for you?
[34:59.00]I mean, there's a hallway there.
[35:00.00]The hallway was there the whole time, but how do you open this door?
[35:02.80]There's no door there for me.
[35:04.30]There's a door here right in front of me.
[35:06.66]There's like there's like a bunch of Blocks that I didn't make disappear with the button Well, I don't know what to tell you I don't think we can beat this level Better go go left go left
[35:31.25]Oh, I didn't... I thought the blocks were gonna hit me, but they didn't.
[35:33.97]You just went through a solid wall for me.
[35:36.69]I know, now you start to see what I'm seeing.
[35:39.11]What a weird fucking happenstance.
[35:40.63]Weird game.
[35:43.27]So, I can't beat this level, you have to beat it.
[35:46.07]You can, uh... I can do nothing.
[35:50.27]There's literally nothing I can do.
[35:51.57]I can go up there and hit and press the button for you.
[35:53.23]You can push the button, yeah.
[35:58.39]There's boxes here for me in case you're wondering.
[36:00.55]There are boxes here for me too.
[36:01.60]Don't worry.
[36:02.18]Come on.
[36:03.08]The whole game is... Revolves around me.
[36:06.26]Why?
[36:06.78]Why?
[36:06.88]Because you deserve it.
[36:08.40]We were both standing there.
[36:13.04]There was no reason.
[36:16.55]Let's just kill the boss and be done with it.
[36:23.39]I need to go first.
[36:24.91]I need to go to the... You just get down there.
[36:26.57]Fine.
[36:26.83]I'll just wait.
[36:30.09]It's still open for me.
[36:32.59]Wait, so you don't need me at all then?
[36:34.17]I'll just hang out.
[36:37.35]Well, I need you to go up there anyway.
[36:39.31]Alright, I pressed the button.
[36:43.39]Oh, he's a duck.
[36:44.19]So here's my job for the rest of the time I play this game, is to just make sure this button is pressed.
[36:49.61]That's it.
[36:51.25]I am no longer needed besides Guy presses button.
[36:54.67]Good luck, have fun.
[36:56.31]You have like a full another like 60% of the level to do.
[37:00.87]Do I?
[37:01.53]Yes, you do.
[37:09.57]Nice.
[37:10.97]Good work.
[37:14.00]Okay, you have to slide in there.
[37:16.60]Then what?
[37:18.60]If you slide too far, there's double spikes.
[37:20.78]If you go down, then what?
[37:21.84]Now you gotta go to the right.
[37:31.87]So you literally can't help.
[37:33.19]I can't do anything.
[37:34.29]Okay, good.
[37:34.73]I'm just going to be here on the first obstacle, if that's okay.
[37:45.90]Alright, you get one.
[37:49.80]This is your last try.
[37:50.86]So there you go.
[37:53.74]There you are.
[37:54.18]No pressure.
[37:55.98]Last try, last attempt.
[38:02.40]Alright, now get to the world map.
[38:05.40]What are you supposed to do there?
[38:07.38]You're supposed to hug the wall immediately.
[38:09.78]And then go right, and then go on the swings.
[38:12.14]Alright, one more try.
[38:14.78]This is your last try, no matter what.
[38:16.47]Even if you die right here.
[38:30.54]Be quiet, everybody.
[38:39.09]There he is.
[38:40.61]Now just beat it.
[38:43.11]Yeah, okay.
[38:43.93]Go for it.
[38:44.53]I have to be the trapeze man.
[38:50.79]Look at this guy.
[38:51.59]Doesn't even need to try.
[38:52.43]What am I supposed to do?
[38:53.85]Alright, here's what you gotta do.
[38:55.25]You have to jump through the spikes.
[38:56.43]You gotta go into the water and then... Hold on, wait.
[38:59.45]What do you do?
[39:00.91]No, no, no, no.
[39:01.71]There's a pendulum above you.
[39:05.73]You have to jump on the pendulum, jump through that space there between the two spikes.
[39:10.87]You have to jump through the two spikes, land on the thing again, then do a final jump over.
[39:17.09]And three, two, one, go.
[39:20.13]Do I even start on the pendulum or do I just jump straight?
[39:22.93]No, you start on the pendulum and then jump through the two spikes.
[39:25.83]You can't even get on the pendulum without dying.
[39:27.73]Yes, you can.
[39:28.63]There's a little spot there.
[39:30.01]Right on the left, the little lip right.
[39:31.42]You can jump on that.
[39:33.53]But don't you just jump from here through the spikes?
[39:36.67]No, you're gonna jump from the pendulum through the spikes.
[39:39.10]Because you have to activate the pendulum.
[39:41.32]Is there a platform in the water?
[39:42.50]There is, but I don't think it goes anywhere.
[39:47.04]Just give it a try.
[39:47.78]Let's go kill the boss.
[39:49.86]Okay.
[39:55.19]Alright, let's go get the boss.
[39:58.32]As far as I could, okay?
[40:00.04]Oh, no, I went to main menu.
[40:02.10]Oh, no, I didn't?
[40:03.70]Yeah.
[40:04.08]Oh, well, I'll just join you again.
[40:06.50]Can I join you?
[40:07.92]Can you?
[40:08.40]Well, none of my stuff is on.
[40:10.04]Everything I have is locked.
[40:12.71]Wait, you just joined my game.
[40:14.39]I did, yeah.
[40:15.57]Here I am.
[40:17.05]The Spiky Peaks Island is locked as well.
[40:20.05]So you're just going to make the lobby.
[40:21.39]Let's go kill the snow boss.
[40:23.33]Where's the snow boss?
[40:24.28]Everything's locked here.
[40:25.12]No, no, because you're in my game now.
[40:27.10]So now you host the game.
[40:31.96]Your game is not locked, mine is.
[40:33.66]How do you quit from here?
[40:34.66]Told P. Why is my game all locked up but yours isn't?
[40:42.91]I'm pretty sure mine's locked too for the thing you're talking about.
[40:47.51]You sure?
[40:51.41]Okay, can you join me as of now?
[40:56.83]Woohoo!
[40:58.49]Yes.
[40:59.61]I'm joining your game.
[41:03.35]The room is invite-only, even though I just got invited.
[41:09.16]This room is... Alright, invite me again?
[41:10.68]Okay.
[41:16.80]Play.
[41:19.28]Has to be immediate, or else it doesn't count.
[41:25.21]Okay, well, thanks everybody for watching.
[41:27.55]That's gonna be it.
[41:29.71]I can't join your game.
[41:30.82]It was a six-hour stream.
[41:32.30]It was more than six hours.
[41:34.82]6.04.
[41:35.22]Whoa.
[41:36.28]Alright, well, that was fun.
[41:44.66]The quota ended.
[41:48.28]As always, Etalyx, that was a lot of fun.
[41:50.02]Thanks for playing.
[41:50.62]Thanks for sticking around for a long time.
[41:51.90]It'll be fun when the game, Vermintide game, is actually released and has like 15 to 25 levels.
[41:59.87]It'll be really fun.
[42:02.46]Don't leave the door.
[42:05.62]But everyone say goodbye to Etalyx.
[42:07.04]We're gonna do the bits.
[42:08.26]Goodbye, Etalyx.
[42:09.90]Do the bits.
[42:10.70]Bye, Etalyx.
[42:11.44]Thanks for playing.
[42:12.20]See you soon.
[42:12.66]Bye-bye.
[42:13.54]Bye, Etalyx Astral.
[42:14.38]He's gone.
[42:14.74]Never mind.
[42:15.04]Alright, well, that was fun.
[42:20.17]I wanted to do a longer stream today to make up for the fact that, obviously, streams have been a little all over the place lately.
[42:29.44]Is it because of the fact that my mother had surgery?
[42:31.90]And you guys know the deal.
[42:32.72]Don't need to talk about it anymore.
[42:36.20]But, uh, for the remainder of this week, there is going to be nothing tomorrow.
[42:44.20]But, but, I'll be streaming on Sunday.
[42:49.08]We'll do a Sunday stream to make it so we can have a good three streams for the week.
[42:54.26]So, another tomorrow.
[42:55.26]Sunday, probably, I'm gonna try to go, like, Sunday afternoon-ish.
[42:58.75]Maybe the same time, like, around, like, four or five.
[43:02.33]And let's do the bits!
[43:06.53]Let's start where we left off last time.
[43:09.99]We're going to go newest to last.
[43:15.17]If you were just hanging out, take care.
[43:18.61]See you Sunday.
[43:20.59]We'll probably start Kingdom Come Deliverance on Sunday.
[43:24.94]We'll try to go... I would assume we're going to go long on Sunday too.
[43:29.78]Because that game requires a lot of time to be in it.
[43:34.11]You can't just jump in and Kingdom Come for two and a half hours and that's it.
[43:38.26]See you later.
[43:39.66]I think that game requires a lot of time.
[43:43.58]So let's go through some of the bits.
[43:46.48]Take care.
[43:47.26]See you Sunday.
[43:48.64]Let's go.
[43:50.85]Archival, thanks for the 30 cents.
[43:52.17]Forgot to say thanks for the games.
[43:53.31]Really hope you pick up Vermintide 2.
[43:54.73]The first one was my favorite game.
[43:56.71]One of my favorite games.
[43:57.47]Love you.
[43:58.09]Love you guys both.
[43:58.91]Thanks a lot, man.
[44:01.37]It's always fun to
[44:04.08]play games like that that are easy that was really easy for people to join too you would not believe how difficult it is sometimes to try to get people into a game that's why I never do it but thanks man thank you uh son jenova son of jenova for the one dollar I used to play farkel with my friends during high school and it's great I'm salty now I'm sorry I'm sorry we didn't play it be one day hey golden cricket right now thanks for two bucks

[44:59.08]Hi, Jerma, love your streams.
[44:59.98]Hoping to sub in the future when I have actual money.
[45:02.14]Sorry, that all I can give you is from watching ads.
[45:06.40]That's alright, man.
[45:06.98]Don't worry about it.
[45:09.33]Do not worry about that at all.
[45:13.11]Thanks for watching.
[45:16.41]Soup or seal?
[45:17.13]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[45:18.37]I already got this one.
[45:21.38]Actually, we did a fairly... We did a large chunk of these.
[45:26.15]We'll get down to right here.
[45:27.47]Yeah, thank you, everybody.
[45:31.00]Getting back a little further now.
[45:32.24]The Helping Llama, thanks for the one dollar.
[45:34.80]Just try putting these in your money shower.
[45:39.38]That would hurt.
[45:41.68]I just imagine a bunch of quarters and dimes and pennies all hitting me in the face and shit.
[45:46.33]That would be terrible.
[45:49.21]Thank you, though, Helping Llama.
[45:50.05]Appreciate it.
[45:50.49]Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar.
[45:52.69]Darkstar7000, yet again, coming in with some bits.
[45:56.12]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:57.08]Welcome to episode one of Germantide, the series where I play Vermintide.
[46:01.46]This is going to be a very entertaining stream.
[46:03.38]And when I say entertaining stream, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[46:09.00]You're very close to banned territory there.
[46:11.52]Be careful.
[46:11.88]Careful.
[46:13.50]Careful.
[46:15.42]Thank you, Darkstar, again for the $1.
[46:17.10]I just found out the other day that my chem lab partner is mining Bitcoin with a seriously impressive rig.
[46:22.46]You know what inspired him to go for it?
[46:25.12]The Big Bang Theory did an episode about it.
[46:27.60]I wish I was kidding.
[46:28.50]Oh, yeah.
[46:33.89]When the Big Bang Theory makes an episode about something that's an investment, time to get out.
[46:40.45]And guess what?
[46:40.87]A lot of people did.
[46:46.45]I meant it long term, though, guys.
[46:50.86]It's going to be fine.
[46:56.00]Lusigi, thanks for the... Lusigi, how do you pronounce the name?
[46:59.64]Thanks for the $10, dude.
[47:02.61]Hey, Jerma, have you heard from Boo recently?
[47:04.93]It's okay if he's moved on to different things.
[47:06.81]Just want to know if he's doing well.
[47:08.05]Great stream.
[47:09.63]I think I talked about this before, like a couple weeks ago.
[47:12.79]Somebody mentioned it.
[47:15.35]We just, I mean, we still are friendly.
[47:18.10]We just kind of have moved to different things, and we just kind of do our own thing.
[47:21.66]Sometimes it happens.
[47:22.34]Sometimes, you know, you just, you go two different ways in life, and you move on to different stuff.
[47:29.86]It's not like I have, I don't, whoa, that guy, boo, he was a dick.
[47:33.44]No, I just, we just got interested in different things, I guess.
[47:37.44]Like, it happens with friends sometimes.
[47:39.56]I'm sure I'll see him again at some point.
[47:44.21]Boo was in the call in the Isaac stream, like, about a year ago.
[47:46.37]Yeah, I mean, he's still around.
[47:50.68]I'm sure he's doing fine.
[47:53.58]But thank you for the $10, dude.
[47:54.58]Appreciate it.
[47:55.94]He's a good dude, nonetheless.
[47:58.40]Ratuna, thanks for the $1.
[47:59.60]jermaRatS are the fifth smartest animals.
[48:02.02]jermaRat is the smarter.
[48:04.52]Oh, no, I'm an idiot.
[48:05.57]They just said jermaRatS smarter than pigs.
[48:09.10]Yeah, rats are really intelligent, that's true.
[48:11.68]I'm not sure if they're smarter than pigs, though.
[48:14.36]Are they cuter than a pig?
[48:15.32]Probably.
[48:15.68]I don't know if they're smarter, though.
[48:19.36]Pigs can read.
[48:22.66]Whole books.
[48:23.78]There's a video on YouTube of a pig rea- Look up YouTube.
[48:26.95]Pig reading entirety of A Song of Ice and Fire.
[48:29.75]A pig, some smart pig reads the whole thing out loud.
[48:32.73]All five books.
[48:34.25]It's pretty impressive, actually.
[48:37.91]Thank you, Swiggity Swaggy, for the 75 cents.
[48:40.29]Grim Dawn is a great alternative to Diablo II if you're interested in playing a Diablo-like game.
[48:46.28]Um... Yeah, actually, I played through most of Grim Dawn, actually.
[48:51.66]It's funny you said somebody just mentioned Boo.
[48:54.65]Me and Boo played through what was currently available, I think it was up to Act 3, when that game was still in early access.
[49:03.85]And it was fun, but I kind of already did it.
[49:06.35]The only thing I didn't do was, like, one of the last acts or two or something.
[49:09.72]There was, like, maybe 30% of the game that we didn't do.
[49:12.80]But I did play through a pretty large portion of that game already.
[49:16.30]And it was good.
[49:20.16]Thank you to Vanderbomb for the $1 here.
[49:23.46]Here is the money.
[49:24.88]Let my family go.
[49:30.24]I don't, dude, does somebody, does somebody, one of these, like, 4,000 people that live here, somebody you know?
[49:39.91]There ain't very many people here.
[49:41.75]Thanks, though.
[49:42.45]Appreciate it, man.
[49:44.75]Uh, that makes it sound like I have, like, 4,000 people here, like, in a dungeon.
[49:49.65]Oh, wait, is there one of these, like, 5,000 people, one of your friends?
[49:53.91]That's not how it's supposed to sound.
[49:55.66]That was making a callback to the mansion joke.
[49:58.26]Oh, boy.
[50:00.09]Thank you, GimliSack, for the $5.
[50:01.37]Hey, Jerma, have you heard about the new Karate Kid movie coming out?
[50:04.23]Thanks, you stinker.
[50:06.61]I have not.
[50:07.47]I loved the Karate Kid movies, though.
[50:08.86]They were great.
[50:09.24]I'll have to check it out.
[50:14.80]Thank you, Entrida, for the $1.
[50:16.50]This game is just like Dark Souls.
[50:20.26]Every game is like Dark Souls.
[50:21.51]That's the point.
[50:23.75]Hey, NotDeadBodKyle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[50:26.63]Thanks for the... Ding!
[50:27.94]You, like, launch, like, a quarter and you say, keep one for yourself, kid.
[50:30.24]And I just snatched it out of the air and I was like, wow, thanks, mister.
[50:34.36]Another random fact, on the 19th of September, 1783, uh, some scientist's name that I can't pronounce, uh, launched the first hot air balloon called Aerostat.
[50:46.37]The passengers were a sheep, a duck, and a rooster, and the balloon stayed in the air for a grand total of 15 minutes before crashing back to the ground.
[50:52.51]Well, that's terrible.
[50:57.73]Thank you, Swifty Bagel, for the one dollar.
[50:59.63]You get a repeating crossbow.
[51:04.27]Referring to... I think, uh, when I was opening one of my first boxes.
[51:10.71]Thank you, Swifty.
[51:14.21]Vanderbomb, thanks for the one dollar.
[51:16.57]Hey, Jerma, I accidentally played embarrassing... Japanese noises in my college class anyway.
[51:24.31]Enjoy the money.
[51:27.94]What do you mean, Japanese noises?
[51:30.03]What are you talking about?
[51:33.79]Why would you play that in your college class?
[51:36.25]What happened there?
[51:36.83]I feel like there's a story there, but... Thanks, dude.
[51:45.33]Thank you to Comcast Customer Care for the $5.
[51:47.83]This stream is going to give my rat nightmares.
[51:54.03]Rats don't... Don't let your rat watch TV.
[51:56.65]His eyes will melt.
[51:58.95]Don't let your rat sit that close to the TV.
[52:00.45]It'll melt his brain.
[52:02.31]Give him a book.
[52:03.65]Have you seen the pig video?
[52:06.14]Should follow suit.
[52:09.62]Thank you, Hanky, or Hank Do for the $1.
[52:14.58]EU boys, who's up?
[52:18.22]Probably not very many because of what you said.
[52:19.86]You said that about five hours ago.
[52:21.30]So maybe back then there may have been some EU boys here.
[52:27.13]Maybe not so much anymore.
[52:29.22]But thanks, dude.
[52:32.26]Marshall Magali, thanks for the $1.
[52:33.98]Today's video from Second Jerma is a masterpiece.
[52:36.02]A big thanks to you and Holy Mackerel.
[52:38.50]It's thanks to the Fuck It February experiment that I started following your streams.
[52:42.06]Keep up the great work and thanks for this partially EU stream.
[52:46.56]I was just, like, threw up in my mouth.
[52:48.06]I don't know why.
[52:48.68]That is, like, burp-pute.
[52:50.39]Anyways.
[52:51.97]Uh, thank you, dude.
[52:53.11]Yes, Holy Mac has done a fantastic job over the last full pretty much year now of cutting up these streams and making them very funny and finding the great moments and he's done a hell of a job.
[53:10.26]Praise to Holy Mac for his fantastic work.
[53:16.47]And Dolby sticks around because he does a great job.
[53:21.79]Bake me home thanks to the $1.
[53:23.23]Please invest this into your crypto of choice.
[53:26.53]Okay.
[53:29.51]Let's see here.
[53:31.89]I don't know.
[53:32.21]$1.
[53:32.61]I'll just buy like $1,000 of one of those coins.
[53:36.25]It's like $0.0001.
[53:36.53]And just like see what happens.
[53:46.12]you though thank you boy Pablo for the one dollar it's really nice of you to do a paid stream sponsored by warhammer vermintide 2. no I bought the game I pre-ordered the game like everybody else on Steam and that's it thanks though boy appreciate it hey zero or z nine nine zero thanks for the 35 cents when did you when you did tinder a year ago
[54:12.28]What did your profile look like?
[54:13.54]What kinds of people did you match with?
[54:15.86]Fucking thousands.
[54:19.04]It was so overwhelming, the amount of matches I was getting on Tinder, that I had to uninstall the app, and come back with a different profile, and I had to make a less handsome picture of me, because wow, it was too many.
[54:33.49]My phone was being spammed.
[54:36.05]Constantly.
[54:36.61]It was like pretty much every quarter of a second.
[54:40.12]I was getting another match on Tinder.
[54:41.74]Damn.
[54:45.65]Actually, it burnt my phone's battery up.
[54:48.31]I had to get, like, three new phones.
[54:59.96]Too many.
[55:02.06]No, but... I don't know.
[55:05.42]I was like, my brain doesn't even comprehend that anymore.
[55:08.91]Tinder is stupid.
[55:10.17]That app sucks.
[55:12.78]Don't ever use that fucking app.
[55:13.96]It's useless.
[55:14.84]It's absolutely worthless.
[55:19.86]But, thanks a lot, man.
[55:22.34]And then... I think that's... I think we caught up there.
[55:26.18]Let's see, what else?
[55:29.67]Thank you, Faulty Pineapple, for the 25 cents.
[55:33.08]Random fact, Billy goats urinate on their own heads to appear attractive to females.
[55:37.08]Oh, I mean, urine is a pretty important mating thing in a lot of the animal kingdoms.
[55:46.12]You smell piss and it makes you want to mate.
[55:51.10]And a lot of animals, that's like the pheromones.
[55:54.46]That does not surprise me at all.
[55:58.88]Thank you Longship Games Live for the 25 cents.
[56:02.98]Hey, Jermo, loving the stream.
[56:03.88]Do you ever see yourself going back to TF2?
[56:06.31]I tried playing it again and I couldn't stay for long.
[56:10.47]We talked about this a few days ago.
[56:14.31]No, probably not.
[56:15.15]I probably won't go back to TF2.
[56:18.55]You know what would actually make me go back to play TF2?
[56:21.83]Would be a substantial, large, significant update to Man vs. Machine.
[56:29.68]And I'm talking a significant addition and update to that game mode.
[56:34.00]I would come back and play it for sure.
[56:38.70]Thank you, Alto Train for the $1.
[56:40.22]Vermintide 2 is really the Dark Souls of Skyrim games.
[56:47.11]Thank you NotDeadModKyle again for the 25 cents.
[56:49.48]Another random fact from Kyle.
[56:52.92]In 1834, Dr. John Cook Bennett started the snake oil fad of peddling ketchup as medicine.
[56:59.64]Eventually, even having a pill salesman turn the stuff into ketchup pills.
[57:06.87]Ketchup is actually pretty... Ketchup is lycopene.
[57:09.79]That's not completely false.
[57:12.28]Ketchup is actually kind of good for you.
[57:17.66]That's it.
[57:20.40]Thank you, Soup or Seal, for the $1.
[57:22.14]I can't believe the two marks were just bots.
[57:23.90]How could you lie to us like that?
[57:25.13]I'll never trust you again.
[57:26.01]I'm sorry.
[57:29.53]I'm really, really, really sorry.
[57:33.29]Hey, BLB, thanks for the $1.
[57:34.97]Medium.
[57:35.41]Talking about steaks.
[57:36.11]That's how they like their steaks.
[57:37.15]Yeah, I respect that.
[57:38.62]That's good.
[57:41.72]Here we go again.
[57:42.46]This is another catch-up fact for you.
[57:43.70]What's with the catch-up today, Kyle?
[57:45.36]Not dead mod, Kyle.
[57:47.57]Ketchup was originally not made from tomatoes.
[57:49.59]It used to be made primarily with either fish or mushrooms.
[57:52.51]Ugh.
[57:54.22]I am so glad they changed over, because I would not eat that.
[58:01.22]Hey, Pin!
[58:01.78]What's going on, Pin?
[58:02.46]Thanks for the $1.
[58:03.22]Hey, Jeremy, I'm getting baptized Mormon on Sunday.
[58:05.36]I'm afraid you're going to have to stop swearing in order for me to support you.
[58:08.71]And then he says... Then he says, fuckface.
[58:13.21]That's a classic.
[58:15.20]That's a classic, don't say any more swears, and now here comes a swear.
[58:21.70]In the book of comedy, it's somewhere in there.
[58:23.24]It's under, um... It's under swearing.
[58:26.20]If you go to the book of comedy and you go to S, you'll go down C's.
[58:31.29]Sea, sea, sea boats.
[58:33.79]Swearing.
[58:35.45]Snakes.
[58:36.57]It's there somewhere.
[58:37.13]It's in the dictionary of comedy.
[58:40.19]Thank you, little pin.
[58:40.71]Appreciate it.
[58:46.31]Hey, Based Scoob, thanks for the $5.
[58:47.77]It's just been over two years since you started streaming full-time.
[58:52.89]I've been here since the whole time, and I loved every second.
[58:54.63]Thank you.
[58:56.23]Thanks a lot, Scoob.
[58:59.87]Oh, that was Etalyx' password, by the way.
[59:01.43]It was Scooby-Doo.
[59:05.80]A terrible password.
[59:07.94]It just made me think about that.
[59:10.64]Watch that be, like, all of Etalyx' passwords.
[59:13.06]Hey, like, make sure you don't tell anybody.
[59:14.50]All my passwords are Scooby-Doo.
[59:19.90]Watch me just, like, blow up all of his accounts.
[59:22.20]Oh, God.
[59:23.16]No, that's not real.
[59:23.96]He just thought of a random word.
[59:25.16]Don't worry.
[59:30.28]Mr. Fancy, thanks for the two bucks.
[59:31.68]Hi.
[59:32.12]Hey.
[59:32.64]Hi.
[59:35.40]And that is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:39.20]That's it.
[59:41.29]There's a couple that just came in right now.
[59:42.74]Thank you, uh... I mean, your name... I'm gonna call you OG Weapon, because the first part of you... But that's not... Whatever.
[59:53.92]It's Anal.
[59:56.30]This guy's name is Anal.
[59:57.06]Alright, thanks a lot, Anal.
[59:59.08]Anal Weapon.
[59:59.64]Thanks for the $1.
[60:00.40]Show us the less handsome picture of you.
[60:05.20]There's plenty of them.
[60:07.30]Go search my name.
[60:08.20]Go search jermaOn Google and you'll find like 25 not handsome pictures of my face.
[60:14.87]You can find that very easily.
[60:21.33]Thank you to Niku Taicho for the five bucks.
[60:25.21]Hey Jerma, last stream you said you would have your retirement on June 26, 2025.
[60:28.27]That's my birthday.
[60:28.94]Change it.
[60:29.20]June 27.
[60:29.38]That's fine.
[60:37.73]Uh, JatootyJabooty, thanks for the $5.10.
[60:40.05]I know people probably ask every day, but I don't get much chance to catch the streams with my work schedule, so I'm sorry, Dad.
[60:47.84]Are you and Ster still doing stuff together, or have you drifted apart like with Boo?
[60:52.84]No, like, it's kind of the same scenario.
[60:55.54]It's just... went just two different paths, two different ways.
[61:01.71]And that's it.
[61:04.75]You know, it just happens.
[61:07.23]That doesn't mean that I'll never talk to anybody like... Oh, I'll never, ever, will ever speak.
[61:14.28]No, it just kind of happens sometimes.
[61:18.66]That's happened to me.
[61:19.42]I've gotten into various... The word's not falling out.
[61:31.21]The word is just kind of... Two people just don't really hang out anymore.
[61:39.10]That doesn't mean that I'll never call him.
[61:41.44]You know what, Star?
[61:43.02]I'm never going to fucking call him again.
[61:45.10]Ever.
[61:46.56]It's just we've been going two different ways completely.
[61:51.18]It's all good.
[61:51.86]Everything's fine.
[61:53.02]Don't worry about it.
[61:54.37]Don't worry about it.
[61:57.19]No.
[61:59.79]We all have people in our life that are like that.
[62:03.01]Here's the thing.
[62:05.83]Think about your own life, right?
[62:08.56]Think about, like, friends you've had.
[62:09.66]Think about, like, even long-term friends you've had.
[62:12.44]How many of those people do you actually still talk to every day?
[62:16.76]If you still talk to, like, 5, 10, 20 years later, if you still talk to some of those people, that's really, really good for you.
[62:24.88]Because it's actually pretty hard to hold more than, like, a 10-year-long friendship.
[62:28.57]A lot of, um... It's actually pretty difficult to do.
[62:35.83]But, no.
[62:37.90]We just kind of went two different ways.
[62:46.84]But you always run into new people.
[62:48.12]That's the thing.
[62:50.64]And even if you don't, you still have people in your life that are still there.
[62:54.70]It's all good.
[62:59.66]But, thank you though, dude.
[63:02.43]Thank you to Darkstar for the $1 here at the very end.
[63:04.82]I'm sorry if my more edgy I hate the streamer cheers annoy you.
[63:09.20]I think busting balls is funny and sometimes I go too far because I'm a smelly lizard.
[63:12.88]Love you.
[63:13.28]XOXO.
[63:16.00]I mean, no.
[63:19.10]It doesn't bother me at all.
[63:21.57]Think about how much shit I talk about other things and other people and stuff.
[63:27.19]If you can dish it and you can't take it, I'm sorry.
[63:30.15]But like, come on now.
[63:32.13]If I can, like, dish out, like, criticisms and insults and, like, get upset, like, actually upset if somebody dishes it to me... You gotta be able to give it and take it.
[63:46.38]And I know that it's... All the things that we're saying are... In jest, right?
[63:50.54]They're not, like, actually... I might... You know, I'm not actually sure... If... And I could be wrong here, but...
[63:58.63]I don't think I've ever looked over at chat and, like, somebody has, like, said something, like, fucking just mean to me.
[64:04.20]Like, that was not, like, a joke.
[64:05.30]Like, a lot of people make jokes.
[64:06.16]We all make jokes.
[64:08.16]But I don't think I've ever looked over and been like, fuck that guy, man.
[64:11.02]What the fuck?
[64:12.12]And, like, actually been upset by it.
[64:14.51]Maybe, like, once or twice, maybe.
[64:17.69]For somebody that's, somebody saying something just fucking, just absolutely uncalled for.
[64:21.77]But I don't think that's happened.
[64:22.59]That doesn't happen very often.
[64:24.72]No, I'm just asking for it.
[64:29.45]Because I know I can like see when people are just, you know, jabbing.
[64:33.27]That's fine.
[64:33.73]That's alright.
[64:42.46]Once or twice and you ban them.
[64:44.56]No, I'm of the opinion.
[64:46.34]I really do believe this.
[64:47.16]This is something that I truly believe.
[64:49.42]That like if you get upset by something, if you actually are getting upset by something and you tell people how upset you are with them,
[64:58.51]Doesn't that kind of just make them want to do it again?
[65:01.22]Right?
[65:01.46]If I was like, don't you say that!
[65:03.02]That's really fucking mean, and you're a bad fucking person!
[65:07.40]That person's gonna be like, okay!
[65:09.18]I'm gonna make another account and come back in ten minutes and do it again.
[65:14.71]It's like negative reinforcement.
[65:20.43]That's not...
[65:26.23]does it it does depend on how you handle it but there is something to be said about telling people that the thing you're saying about me makes me super upset and like I don't like that don't you do that again like not like joking because I joke like that a lot oh man that guy forever like that's obviously just a joke right but if I actually got upset on stream truly upset and like called somebody out and was like don't you dare I feel like that would just cause more problems
[65:57.05]And look, people have their opinions too.
[66:00.03]Another point is... This is just about me in general, I guess.
[66:05.93]If you don't like me, I can't change that, right?
[66:10.76]If you come to this stream and you listen to me and you're like, Oh, this guy sucks.
[66:13.10]Fuck this guy.
[66:13.82]I hate this guy.
[66:16.72]You are entitled to think that.
[66:19.24]I can't tell you to stop.
[66:20.30]I can't tell you to not think that.
[66:21.70]You have your own opinions.
[66:22.76]You have your own mindset on anything you watch.
[66:27.80]Anything you see.
[66:29.72]People think they can control everybody and be like, no, I need everybody to like me.
[66:32.72]You'd have to like me.
[66:33.66]I can't do that.
[66:41.49]The stream always ends when the real stuff comes out.
[66:46.45]But if somebody doesn't like me, then that's fine.
[66:48.95]Because I'm not going to change that person's mind.
[66:51.23]You know what I mean?
[66:58.91]Like, I'm not gonna... That's not... It's not even like a block out the haters.
[67:02.90]Like, if you don't... I respect your opinion to not like me.
[67:07.48]Well, who's the famous comedian that says, I don't agree with what you say, but I've defended the death of your right to say it?
[67:13.64]John Candy?
[67:15.02]John Candy said that, I think, at some point.
[67:25.20]Please check your Facebook page.
[67:26.78]What, did my Facebook page get, like, hacked?
[67:38.79]Yeah, but, um... But in all honesty, that's... If people have their opinions, then that's fine.
[67:48.39]And if you tell somebody their opinion's wrong, that's like yelling at a wall.
[67:53.57]Your opinion's wrong, and here's why.
[67:55.23]What am I going to do?
[67:56.59]Change your mind?
[67:58.43]No, you don't like me, but here's why that's wrong for you not to like me.
[68:01.73]I'm going to tell you one reason why, and it's going to change your mind.
[68:04.59]No, it's not.
[68:09.30]Hey, thanks SuperSeal for the 25 cents.
[68:10.78]When is Otto's Big Adventure 3 happening?
[68:15.75]I said I was going to make it.
[68:17.27]But then I was like, nah.
[68:18.73]So this is your answer.
[68:21.05]Thank you, Eves, for the $5 at the very end.
[68:24.09]Love you, Jerma.
[68:24.59]Hope your mom is recovering well and I hope you're doing alright.
[68:26.83]Keep the amazing, inspiring streams.
[68:29.37]Thank you, Eves.
[68:31.55]My mother is doing just fine.
[68:34.70]She's recovered very nicely from her surgery.
[68:36.70]Thank you for the concern.
[68:37.48]Appreciate it.
[68:42.95]But that is going to be it.
[68:45.01]Thanks everybody for sticking around.
[68:45.87]This is a long one.
[68:48.87]Just over six and a half hours.
[69:01.59]Great to hear.
[69:02.17]Thank you.
[69:03.19]It is great to hear from you too.
[69:05.86]Because she was looking forward to this surgery for a long time and she's doing just fine.
[69:13.33]But take care, everybody.
[69:14.13]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[69:16.69]Sunday, uh, probably afternoon.
[69:25.77]Probably, uh, don't ex- I wouldn't expect like a seven hour, almost six, seven hour stream on Sunday.
[69:32.58]But we're gonna be going for a little while because Kingdom Come Deliverance is...
[69:39.68]It's probably going to take a long time to get through.
[69:41.74]At least portions of the game that I want to see.
[69:43.68]So, good night.
[69:46.04]Take care.
[69:47.30]See you Sunday.
[70:30.71]So,
