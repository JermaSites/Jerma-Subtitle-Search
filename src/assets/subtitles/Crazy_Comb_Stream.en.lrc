[03:09.64]Where's the pen that comes with it?
[03:11.68]I don't think I have a marker for this.
[03:23.91]That was a pre-recorded drop.
[03:25.43]Not really.
[03:29.64]I gotta get a marker.
[03:30.52]You're gonna have to wait another two seconds for this.
[03:34.72]Be right back.
[03:35.40]I gotta get a marker.
[05:28.55]I have no idea.
[05:32.99]I actually have no idea where a marker is.
[05:36.21]So we're going to use lipstick.
[05:38.77]This is Kim's lipstick.
[05:40.91]We can wipe it off.

[06:19.97]Okay, like beat the clock music.
[06:29.52]This is called A Theme of Beat the Clock.

[08:36.80]You got it!
[08:40.97]Got it!
[08:41.89]Batman.
[08:43.31]That's the bat symbol.
[08:45.47]And this was gonna- I was gonna finish this, I was gonna draw, uh... Commissioner Gordon down here, putting the light up there.
[08:53.46]Batman.
[08:53.80]Somebody said Batman.
[08:54.44]You got it.
[08:55.04]Nice work.
[09:00.40]That's not even close.
[09:06.03]Yes, it is.
[09:09.53]Somebody got it in the chat, so that's close enough.
[09:13.19]Have fun wiping it off.
[09:14.33]Oh, you don't think I've never done this before?
[09:16.02]I've never done this before.
[09:19.62]Hey, Merry fucking Christmas.
[09:22.86]It's the same color.
[09:23.68]My mother won't even know.
[09:35.67]It's not gonna work.
[09:36.89]Jeremy, it's not gonna work.
[09:53.14]It worked.
[09:55.68]Olivia.
[09:59.56]That's better.
[10:01.65]Okay, so now, let's do it again.
[10:09.56]It worked, you guys, don't ever misjudge me, okay?
[10:14.60]I probably should change this to IRL, because we're not doing that anymore.
[10:27.00]Okay, that's better.
[10:28.68]The doctor is incompetent, that could mean anything, right?
[10:34.28]You heard that and I didn't do anything, you understand?
[10:38.71]There's like an animal in here.
[10:40.92]There's an animal down here somewhere.
[10:48.18]Okay.
[10:52.18]I've said it like four times.
[10:55.42]That works.
[10:56.02]Alright, ready?
[10:57.80]Same deal, let's do it again.
[11:01.76]This one's gonna be a little harder.
[11:03.70]It's gonna be very specific.
[11:05.07]Hope you can get it.
[11:13.12]Somebody just said I had mustache hair.
[11:24.11]You motherfucker.
[11:26.43]Mustache hair.
[11:34.16]And here we go.
[11:50.29]Son, that's too easy!
[12:05.64]Yeah, try to get this one.
[12:09.10]Good luck.
[12:35.67]There's no more!
[12:49.63]How the f- Why?
[12:50.87]Did you guys get that already?
[12:52.25]Medusa, what?
[12:57.20]This is a permanent marker, so I gotta wipe this right away.
[13:03.58]How did you get Medusa?
[13:06.79]Oh, fuck.
[13:10.01]Oh, fuck, fuck.
[13:10.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:11.71]I like this shirt.
[13:12.93]I actually do like this shirt.
[13:13.99]Don't touch this.
[13:27.88]This is permanent marker.
[13:47.80]Lipstick comes out, right?
[13:49.26]People, do dudes like, don't they get caught with the lipstick on your shoulder though?
[13:53.00]And that like joke thing?
[13:57.03]Did people wash that first?
[13:59.03]Or did you just come in from cheating on your wife and hang up your shirt that has lipstick on it?
[14:04.49]How does that work?
[14:06.19]Why would that little like cliche exist?
[14:08.37]Did the guy wash his shirt first?
[14:12.14]Got lipstick on the collar, right?
[14:13.42]But like, did you wash it first?
[14:15.38]Or did you just put it up?
[14:19.16]Never comes up.
[14:21.94]Does he use cleanser?
[14:22.84]Okay, cool.
[14:23.90]That's all I needed to hear.
[14:32.63]Gravity exists, Jeremy.
[14:34.55]I just don't want it to touch me, it's covered.
[14:36.73]Alright, here we go!
[15:03.29]Can you even see?
[15:07.56]Nothing, nobody's got it.
[15:31.64]Fried egg.
[15:32.52]Somebody got it.
[15:40.66]Nice work, guys.
[15:43.96]Fried egg.
[15:44.42]Nice work, you got it.
[15:47.64]It was too fried, I was gonna put bacon there too.
[15:49.25]Okay.
[15:52.11]Good?
[15:59.23]It's a permanent marker, this ain't coming off.
[16:05.12]Permanent marker does not... An eye!
[16:08.60]Somebody got an eye!
[16:40.97]That was fun.
[16:48.23]Nice board.
[16:49.05]This was going in the trash anyways.
[16:55.45]Get water?
[17:00.82]Hey, nice to meet you.
[17:02.10]It's Jeremy.
[17:03.80]I'm a big fan of fucking fire hot Cheetos.
[17:08.30]Shouldn't we all be?
[17:12.38]That's like, that dude ate a whole bag by himself and didn't go like this once.
[17:18.26]Jesus Christ, okay.
[17:19.88]Somebody said get water.
[17:34.87]Oh my God, they were right.
[17:36.09]This is doing a great job.
[17:45.54]I'm not even going to do this again.
[17:46.66]Why am I doing this?
[17:49.00]The permanent marker ones just won't go away.
[17:53.67]Go get acetone?
[17:54.79]You think I have acetone in my house?
[17:56.35]I'm not a fucking biochemist.
[18:07.44]I'm moving in like two and a half weeks.
[18:09.74]I'm getting rid of shit.
[18:11.18]Look at the acetone really is like chemical reacting here.
[18:13.80]Look at that.
[18:15.28]Oh, that's coffee.
[18:16.04]That's because this was coffee in here originally.
[18:17.72]Look what it's doing.
[18:18.46]This is fucking scientific here.
[18:21.18]Take a look.
[18:22.82]So I've wiped it up, but look, it's beating.
[18:24.46]Can you see?
[18:26.74]You can't see.
[18:31.29]You can't even see what I'm talking about.
[18:32.83]Well, that was fun.
[18:34.43]That was fun.
[18:35.09]Something else to fucking clean up.
[18:36.23]That's great.
[18:41.88]Oh, I just love Cheetos so much.
[18:43.66]Alright, let's wash this off.
[18:53.36]I need the other one.
[18:55.54]Wasn't there two?
[18:56.28]Yeah, there was.
[18:58.22]I got an idea.
[19:00.52]This is going to work.
[19:01.97]This is a pretty good idea.
[19:07.97]I'm going to make a hand washing machine.
[19:19.38]There we go.
[19:35.85]There's something in here.
[19:37.65]What's on my hand?
[19:38.23]Is it like a bug in here?
[19:43.67]It's gonna be spotless when I take my hand out.
[19:46.69]Ready?
[19:47.97]Ready?
[19:49.45]What are you doing?
[19:50.07]What a weirdo.
[19:51.51]Spotless.
[19:52.71]Thank you very much.
[20:01.11]That's a stain.
[20:01.73]That's not anything on the... Haven't you guys ever eaten Cheetos before?
[20:04.61]It's a stain.
[20:09.02]These are clean.
[20:09.56]These are the cleanest my hands have ever been.
[20:13.90]See?
[20:21.55]We're good.
[20:22.71]I was about to unzip this, but I can't do that.
[20:25.41]Go wash your hands.
[20:26.13]They're washed!
[20:27.03]They're clean!
[20:28.83]I'll go like this if you want.
[20:35.09]See?
[20:36.19]We're fine.
[20:38.94]You have to do hands in acid.
[20:40.36]You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
[20:45.92]That's good.
[20:49.42]These pants are like fucking 12 cents.
[20:51.14]Alright.
[20:54.10]Everything's fine.
[20:55.12]We're good.
[20:56.56]So what were we doing?
[20:57.26]Everyone was yelling at me.
[21:04.03]What a steal.
[21:04.69]What a steal.
[21:07.39]Somebody said my hair was a mustache and I kind of want to like fuck with that.
[21:12.51]Can I get like a clean shaven person's face and then put like put this on here?
[21:21.92]I don't think that's going to work.
[21:24.36]I guess it might.
[21:27.92]I can draw here, right?
[21:29.18]Can I?
[21:32.89]Add an image.
[21:36.39]Can I actually just draw in here?
[21:41.65]No, I can't.
[21:46.49]Let me see if I can get a picture or something.
[21:49.19]But then I would have to superimpose... Hold on.
[22:01.12]No, it's not going to work.
[22:03.36]Just imagine that... Well, I guess I could do this, right?
[22:06.92]Let's give myself a mustache with my own hair.
[22:09.40]That would work, wouldn't it?
[22:11.66]Yeah, watch, right?
[22:13.92]Just make a duplicate.
[22:17.48]Copy.
[22:18.95]And then paste.
[22:20.41]No, paste duplicate.
[22:21.25]Why can't I do a duplicate?
[22:24.03]It's annoying.
[22:28.27]Ready to go?
[22:28.73]I'm right here.
[22:32.37]Maybe I can just... Yeah, I think I can just do it like this.
[22:34.15]Why are you doing this to me?
[22:41.28]Copy.
[22:42.58]Paste.
[22:43.40]I can't paste a duplicate of this camera.
[22:46.08]I don't know why.
[22:48.07]But regardless.
[22:51.51]Oh, what am I?
[22:52.11]Don't touch your hair with this fucking hands.
[22:54.31]Don't touch my head.
[22:59.19]Just put a clip of myself.
[23:01.03]Yeah, but then it's going to be too hard.
[23:02.35]How are we doing?
[23:10.47]Let me move this.
[23:11.17]I thought it was clean.
[23:11.89]I mean that they're clean, but they're not immaculately clean.
[23:17.58]Yeah.
[23:21.14]Can't you do a screen?
[23:21.74]I mean, I could.
[23:22.22]Let's do this.
[23:23.06]I'll try it.
[23:24.04]I'll screen cap here.
[23:34.65]I'm fucking weird looking.
[23:41.07]There it is.
[23:41.55]Okay.
[23:42.91]This is going to be too... This is going to be way too hard.
[23:48.92]It might actually not be that hard.
[23:50.88]Alright, let's save that.
[23:55.83]Untitled, who cares?
[23:56.91]Okay.
[24:00.91]Add image.
[24:03.88]Untitled.
[24:04.64]Alright, here we go.
[24:19.25]This is not going to work, because hold on.
[24:48.57]I gotta lock this one.
[25:01.56]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[25:07.67]Why?
[25:28.89]Hold on, I gotta make this right.
[25:49.80]That's better.
[25:53.98]I can't believe my hair is actually a mustache.
[25:56.48]That's so embarrassing.
[26:03.11]That's absolutely fucking humiliating.
[26:11.77]I would look good with a mustache?
[26:13.11]No, I would not.
[26:16.61]What if I put like different eyes?
[26:17.91]I mean, we've already done this.
[26:22.23]I did this, but not this exact thing though.
[26:24.21]Hold on.
[26:28.83]Strap in.
[26:29.29]This is going to get real fucking weird.
[26:30.57]I just, I need to be able to copy this.
[26:36.43]Like I need to copy and paste that.
[26:46.52]I don't know why I can't do it.
[26:51.32]It's annoying.
[26:56.45]Hold on.
[26:59.69]Paste?
[27:00.09]I can't.
[27:00.55]It's grayed out for some reason.
[27:03.95]Hold on.
[27:07.65]Let's just paste it.
[27:16.84]It's going to turn into Picasso.
[27:35.63]Hey kids!
[27:50.42]Hey look, I have the magnifying glass!
[28:10.53]I need the nose too.
[28:11.53]Hold on.
[28:24.10]I'll get the nose.
[28:24.64]Hold on.
[28:25.36]I'm going to get every piece of my face.
[28:26.86]We're going to rebuild my face.
[28:28.88]Inch by fucking inch.
[28:29.78]You think I'm kidding?
[28:30.50]We're doing the whole thing.
[28:38.66]I just can't move.
[28:46.13]I gotta lock this in place.
[28:47.29]Where is this one?
[28:49.10]Lock it.
[28:49.38]Okay, there we go.
[29:15.24]This looks so fucking odd.
[29:24.64]What?
[29:48.21]I feel like you're all on acid right now.
[29:55.64]Where did my eyebrows go?
[29:56.72]I don't need eyebrows.
[29:57.38]I need my ears.
[30:06.63]I was going to do the same ear.
[30:34.28]This is way harder than it looks.
[30:40.90]I gotta stay right here.
[31:07.82]Ah!
[31:12.39]Chin We're almost done I've been holding a photo for 10 straight minutes
[31:40.24]Take the fucking photo, please, God.
[32:12.60]Okay.
[32:13.68]We're good.
[32:17.55]Did it.
[32:18.15]Done.
[32:22.47]Hey.
[32:27.33]It's like somebody broke glass.
[32:29.32]That's all this looks like.
[32:33.06]It's complete.
[32:38.18]Hold on.
[32:38.58]Ready?
[32:47.48]I gotta know when to stop.
[32:48.32]Hold on.
[33:01.79]Here we go.
[33:02.17]Ready?
[33:06.11]Okay.
[33:07.27]Not yet.
[33:10.05]Right here.
[33:19.63]In a past life, he was himself.
[33:23.83]If opportunity knocks, and he's not home, opportunity waits.
[33:29.96]He gave his father the talk.
[33:33.50]He is the most interesting man in the world.
[33:36.64]I don't always drink beer.
[33:39.06]But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.
[33:44.07]Stay thirsty.
[33:44.79]Opportunity waits.
[33:46.77]Life, he was himself.
[33:50.40]If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.
[33:56.52]He gave his father the talk.
[34:00.04]He is the most interesting man in the world.
[34:03.91]I don't always drink beer.
[34:05.63]But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.
[34:10.69]Stay thirsty, my friends.
[34:32.67]What else can we do with this?
[34:33.96]Is there anything else I can do with this?
[34:37.62]Holy God, that's awful.
[34:47.94]Turn the mouth upside down.
[34:51.31]And then just do it again?
[34:52.64]The same commercial?
[34:54.90]Hold on.
[35:11.58]Wait, wait.
[35:12.99]This is going to be hard to do.
[35:20.21]I gotta get in the right spot.
[35:25.97]Transform.
[35:34.48]Right there.
[35:35.78]Right, no, right here.
[35:36.84]I'm gonna have to do a little bit of rekindling here.
[35:46.98]That's good.
[35:48.06]The eyes need to change now.
[36:11.50]Okay.
[36:12.88]Are you ready?
[36:14.26]Right here.
[36:18.74]Okay, I'm ready.
[36:26.40]If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.
[36:32.52]He gave his father the talk.
[36:36.05]He is the most interesting man in the world.
[36:39.25]I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.
[36:46.69]Stay thirsty, my friends.
[37:02.15]This is hurting my face.
[37:03.91]Alright, what about like a guy, hold on.
[37:07.77]The scene in Total Recall.
[37:17.54]When like his face comes around.
[37:26.06]Where is it?
[37:26.44]Alright, I'm ready.
[37:31.30]Remember this scene?
[37:32.48]Arrest that woman!
[37:34.02]Get that woman!
[37:36.32]Grab her!
[37:38.98]Back off these people!
[37:53.65]Clear!
[37:57.63]It's me!
[37:58.09]Wait!
[37:58.43]It's me!
[37:58.97]Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[38:07.02]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[38:09.78]Did anyone ever see that movie?
[38:11.70]Or is that too old?
[38:12.50]This one.
[38:12.86]This scene is what I was just doing.
[38:16.91]You guys know.
[38:17.45]You guys know what scene I'm talking about.
[38:19.37]It's a classic scene.
[38:27.71]Before I delete this, I gotta do one more.
[38:29.21]How about, um...
[38:37.53]I can't think of any other scenes that would require this.
[38:43.47]Imagine trying to do this facecam the whole day.
[38:54.24]We can really change our perspective here a little.
[39:14.41]Because now this is just becoming the hey, look, I just got an iPad for the first day.
[39:40.44]Can I even become remotely normal from this?
[39:42.74]I don't think so.
[40:08.31]Well, that don't look good at all.
[40:15.27]Put the mustache on?
[40:17.90]I can't.
[40:18.42]There's too many layers.
[40:20.30]What is this?
[40:20.76]What's going on here?
[40:25.74]Oh, that was the mouth.
[40:26.68]Oh, shit.
[40:39.51]okay I need one last put the mustache on oh god damn it fine hold on I have to move some more things around it's gone I don't know where I don't know where it is
[41:09.03]I don't know where it went.
[41:10.22]Where did it just go?
[41:44.13]I can't type this, I need to... I don't know, what's a famous song that he did?
[44:05.65]That's enough that's okay like Do scat man, I don't even know the lyrics to that Oh my fucking god, okay.
[44:26.98]I'll see you in a minute.
[44:28.14]I mean, let me try I
[44:39.76]I'm a scat man.
[45:21.80]Everybody stutters one way or the other, so check out my message to you.
[45:25.09]As a matter of fact, I don't let nothing hold you back.
[45:26.89]If the scatman can't do it, so can you.
[45:28.85]I don't know the words to this fucking song, so I have no idea what I'm doing.
[45:31.27]But what you don't know, I'm gonna tell you right now, that the stutter and the scat is the same thing.
[45:35.40]Yo, I'm the scatman.
[45:42.92]Why should we be pleasing any politician who would try to cheat the seasons if they could?
[45:46.32]The state of the condition insults my intuition, and it only makes me crazier in a hard Latin world.
[45:50.06]Everybody stutters one way or the other, so check out my message to you.
[45:53.33]As a matter of fact, don't let nothing hold you back.
[45:55.07]If the scatman can do it, brother, so can you.
[45:56.75]I'm the scatman.
[46:43.15]The only one that's left is the mustache, really?
[46:55.38]Alright, was this upside down?
[46:57.30]I can't tell, my face is so fucked up.
[46:59.12]I can't even tell if this is upside down.
[47:05.91]Yeah, it's upside down.
[47:06.53]Hold on.
[47:08.55]Reset transformation.
[47:11.95]Hi.
[47:16.62]Okay, I'm like this.
[47:17.48]Wait, watch this.
[47:17.94]Ready?
[47:19.40]This is another layer here.
[47:44.75]That's good.
[47:49.41]It could be chest hair or it could be a mustache.
[47:54.08]I don't want you to see that shit.
[47:56.84]Ah, alright.
[47:58.78]There's no nudity.
[47:59.58]Is there anything in the back of this?
[48:01.91]I'm sorry, I keep hitting that.
[48:03.65]It's just that little window face thing.
[48:06.83]There's something tiny right here.
[48:08.09]What is it?
[48:09.74]Do you see this?
[48:10.96]Right there.
[48:12.66]What is that?
[48:22.80]What is this?
[48:29.16]More hair.
[48:32.78]Enhance.
[48:34.36]No, delete it, actually.
[48:39.31]It's hot.
[48:41.29]So that was 30, that was 35 minutes of that.
[48:47.73]By the way, just realizing.
[48:49.23]I feel like that may have gone on a little too long.
[49:05.24]Dude, play Painkiller.
[49:06.46]You guys want me to play Painkiller?
[49:07.30]Really?
[49:08.70]Is Painkiller a game that people want to see?
[49:13.10]That's a game where it's just waves and waves of monsters, right?
[49:19.51]Alright, what do you think?
[49:20.27]Glasses on or glasses off?
[49:21.47]Because these are prescription glasses.
[49:23.44]These are my glasses.
[49:24.80]I'm supposed to wear these every day, but I refuse.
[49:26.88]So what do you think?
[49:35.05]Should I wear them?
[49:42.76]They can't be all the way up.
[49:43.48]It's going to be like that.
[49:44.10]I feel like I could be a scientist with these on.
[49:49.22]Imagine me now, right?
[49:51.80]Imagine if I were to do something.
[49:53.04]I'm going to read this for you.
[49:53.89]Ready?
[49:55.77]I'm going to do two separate occasions here.
[49:57.13]So this is like just Jeremy, right?
[49:59.81]Watch this.

[50:36.23]Just like a scientific study.
[50:39.83]PDF.
[50:40.79]I don't even care.
[50:46.43]Uh... No.
[50:48.38]Medical scientific study.
[50:50.70]Okay, we'll read this one.
[50:56.36]Tell me if you like Trust Me more.
[50:59.62]Here we go.
[51:04.57]get this out here this is a medical scientific study for what I'm I'm not exactly sure uh I don't know what this is okay here we go here we go okay so I'll start it here
[51:29.44]You've been asked to take part in a medical scientific study.
[51:32.70]This brochure will help you in making your decision about whether or not to participate.
[51:37.34]Here you'll find general information about medical scientific research, about what participant means for you.
[51:42.76]Your doctors will give you a specific information.
[51:45.42]Yeah, that just doesn't work.
[51:46.66]That don't work.
[51:48.06]That just don't work.
[52:03.70]Welcome to the test.
[52:06.94]You have been asked to participate in a medical scientific study.
[52:09.92]Now, this brochure will have you making your decision whether or not to participate or not.
[52:13.46]Here you'll find general information about medical scientific research and about specific properties and very smart things.
[52:21.35]I've missed my... I fucked up.
[52:25.47]It's alright.
[52:26.83]This is going to be hard to do, but we're going to try it.
[52:28.45]Here we go.
[52:30.11]In this brochure, the following question will be dealt with.
[52:33.13]What is medical scientific research and what does it entail?
[52:36.49]Are there risks for the test subject?
[52:38.57]What rights do the test subjects have?
[52:40.73]How is the study carried out?
[52:42.59]At the back of the brochure, you will find an explanatory glossary and space for notes and other questions you may have.
[52:48.84]A questionnaire has also been included that may possibly be due to help you in deciding whether or not to participate.
[52:55.21]If after reading this brochure you still have questions, it is best to ask your physician.
[52:59.85]This also applies to the scientific information concerning the study at which cooperation is requested.
[53:06.89]Medical scientific research is done in order to, among other things, find better treatments for diseases.
[53:13.26]Research investigation whether or not a new treatment satisfies the expectations and if has side effects.
[53:18.80]Such scientific research is only possible with the cooperation of test subjects.
[53:22.59]These could be patients, but could also be healthy volunteers.
[53:26.57]The cooperation of patients is essential if the scientific research deals with the studying of the effects of treatment.
[53:31.91]Other names for the medical scientific research are scientific research, clinical studies, clinical research, clinical trial, medical experiment.
[53:38.38]In this brochure, we will continually use the term scientific research.
[53:42.42]Scientific research focuses on various subjects.
[53:44.34]For example, methods of diagnosing an illness, treatments of a diagnosis, which one was smarter?
[54:02.43]I'm going to poke my eye out.
[54:03.51]This is not... You can't do that, guys.
[54:06.79]Find me somebody to poke their eye out with a pair of reading glasses and I'll guarantee you a victory.
[54:12.13]For me.
[54:19.82]My eyes got... Did my eyes get cured?
[54:21.72]I think I may have been cured.
[54:28.50]My eyesight is perfect.
[54:30.06]What happened?
[54:30.72]What?
[54:31.85]There's nothing, there's no difference anymore.
[54:34.03]That's why I told you to eat your carrots.
[54:36.44]I told you to eat more garlic and you didn't listen.
[54:39.84]I don't need glasses anymore.
[54:41.44]I ate enough garlic and carrots to be cured by, I can see perfectly fine, 2020.
[54:55.17]I don't even need these.
[54:56.33]I've become so healthy.
[55:05.76]That's what Scatman looks like?
[55:09.51]Scatman actually has a big mustache.
[55:13.93]Hold on a minute.
[55:14.57]Scatman was like 50 when he made this video.
[55:18.03]What?
[55:18.89]This is blowing my entire world upside down.
[55:22.96]He's like an old man.
[55:24.30]What?
[55:24.60]I thought he was like a young like rave guy.
[55:26.98]I'm about to blow a lot of your guys' minds here.
[55:40.39]Scatman.
[55:43.79]This is actually shocking to me.
[55:47.23]That's why somebody said Scatman.
[55:51.57]Add image.
[55:59.23]There he is.
[56:00.84]That's Scatman.
[56:05.10]I thought he was like 30.
[56:10.55]Wow.
[56:11.51]I didn't know that.
[56:18.17]That's interesting.
[56:20.95]He's the most interesting man in the world.
[56:25.17]Let's talk about Vegas.
[56:26.80]Why not?
[56:28.20]No, let's not talk about Vegas.
[56:29.44]I already told you there's nothing to talk about.
[56:30.94]I'm not good with these.
[56:32.78]I have to morph my face or get hurt on camera with my toes.
[56:41.70]Let's like go down here.
[56:44.49]Can you sleep on stream?
[56:45.35]Is that allowed?
[56:46.49]No, it's definitely not allowed.
[56:47.57]And people are gonna come to the stream and think that I'm like one of those Twitch guys.
[56:49.91]I cleared this whole desktop already.
[56:56.64]There's nothing in here.
[57:08.63]That's better.
[57:14.59]I still, why would I get rid of this?
[57:15.72]This is like a sentimental piece of my childhood.
[57:17.66]You think I'm gonna throw it in the trash?
[57:28.56]Oh wait, that face in the thumbnail?
[57:30.48]That was in the thumbnail for IRL?
[57:32.53]Oh God.
[57:33.25]That's so fucking stupid.
[57:43.58]Did I gamble in Vegas?
[57:44.64]I gambled in Vegas.
[57:45.40]I didn't gamble that much money.
[57:47.56]I gambled enough to go like, cool, but not enough to go, whew.
[57:53.60]I don't know what that means.
[57:54.58]I have no idea what that was.
[57:56.29]I was so focused on making sure that this was not, who cares?
[58:03.05]I am a Twitch person.
[58:06.47]One thing I found though, you guys are going to be happy about this.
[58:09.45]Remember the original comb?
[58:11.83]The first comb stream?
[58:13.41]All those years ago, back in 2017, 2016, here it is.
[58:18.87]Found it.
[58:21.95]Speaking of which, can somebody explain to me why when you're driving around, but you go to a restaurant, you go to a business and they have that proudly, proudly established, been serving business since like 2002.
[58:34.00]That ain't long enough to have that sign.
[58:39.78]You know, it's like that ain't, that's not, that's not that long.
[58:43.46]Like proudly established in 2009.
[58:45.40]You got to go back before the 80s, man, or I don't care.
[58:52.06]To have a sign like that, you've got to have a full relative amount of time.
[58:57.95]Like before you, right?
[58:59.03]Oh, my grandmother established this restaurant 75 years ago.
[59:03.15]That's a whole generation.
[59:04.81]Not like you graduated business school and you opened up in 2010.
[59:09.12]Like, don't put that sign up.
[59:12.52]Don't do that.
[59:20.03]This might be dirty.
[59:23.63]There's another mustache.
[59:24.82]This kind of smells like chemicals.
[59:26.26]I don't want to put this in my hair.
[59:31.34]How dare you take pride in your success.
[59:35.08]No, but that's not what I'm saying.
[59:36.22]I'm saying like, if you have a sign that says like, we've been serving for a really long time, six years.
[59:43.71]It's like people that did give me like 30 years, 25 years.
[59:46.79]I think it's like, okay, you've been here for a long time.
[59:53.53]Well, 2002 will be 20 years in five years.
[59:55.81]In five years it will be, not right now.
[60:02.32]Maybe they're happy to have served people, asshole.
[60:16.75]I'm sorry.
[60:25.06]I'm sorry.
[60:25.72]I'm sorry.
[60:26.38]That was mean.
[60:28.20]And somebody thought that was mean.
[60:29.14]I'm sorry about that.
[60:34.12]Now I made him sad.
[60:38.07]No, I'm ready.
[60:38.61]I'm happy.
[60:39.29]I'm ready to go.
[60:41.11]Not that much longer.
[60:42.29]It's locked in.
[60:44.39]The purpose of the trip last week was to find a real place.
[60:47.01]When I went out in June, remember I said, oh, I'm going to Vegas.
[60:50.03]I'm going to move to Vegas.
[60:51.13]The trip I took in June was to make sure I wanted to actually live there.
[60:55.03]Check out the area.
[60:56.73]Look at some places.
[60:57.61]Preliminary.
[60:58.11]Do I actually want to live in Las Vegas?
[61:00.28]Is this like a stupid idea?
[61:01.50]And I was there for a weekend and it was like, okay, this is... Yeah, I want to look and live here.
[61:07.10]This last week was... We need to find a house and find a place to live.
[61:12.46]So... That happened.
[61:17.97]It's so hot in Vegas.
[61:18.89]I like it like that.
[61:21.49]I like it when it's really hot.
[61:26.46]Play a game, you lame comb streamer.
[61:32.02]I'm gonna let that one slide.
[61:41.79]Why do I have like a McDonald's haircut?
[61:44.31]I'm talking about not like a clown, I'm talking about the M. Well, I was playing a game and everybody hated it.
[61:51.39]So I stopped playing and then we started doing this weird shit.
[61:58.69]I was playing at the Two Point Hospital for like a couple hours, and I would look over at the chat, I would look over at the chat over here, and it was just like, fuck you, I hate this, lame, ResidentSleeper, what, you think I'm gonna, I gotta give the people what they want.
[62:17.74]I gotta give the chats over here what they want.
[62:21.50]People, I know, but like, I have this thing where I can, when I gauge how much people don't want to see something, it's very, very quick to look over and just see like a fucking stampede of people saying, I don't like this.
[62:36.68]This sucks.
[62:37.47]This is boring.
[62:38.09]This is boring.
[62:38.69]This is, it's like, it's hard to be like, everything's going real well here.
[62:57.71]Don't let me give you the ASMR again.
[63:00.21]Play Halo 3.
[63:02.18]Is Halo 3 a good game?
[63:08.10]We'd rather watch you enjoy yourself.
[63:10.73]Yeah, but it's like...
[63:13.61]I like to play off of you guys and what you guys are saying.
[63:16.41]And I mean, I look over the chats, I'm going to say something like, oh yeah, that's interesting.
[63:19.06]That's funny.
[63:19.38]Let's talk about that for a second.
[63:20.20]Oh, that's cool.
[63:22.04]I can't play off of you guys, people writing how much they hate the game, right?
[63:26.48]Like I can only be like, hey, fuck you.
[63:28.02]I'm a streamer and it's my life.
[63:30.02]But I mean, like there's no fun banter there.
[63:33.67]It's just half the people in the chat don't like it.
[63:37.95]And I sit here and I'm like, no, you're wrong.
[63:40.27]I like it.
[63:41.33]That's the banter there.
[63:42.21]That's the fun.
[63:44.78]I'd rather just have fun.
[63:45.74]And if we can't do that, then I mean like... Spider-Man is out too!
[63:53.92]I gotta play Spider-Man.
[63:58.47]Spider-Man is gonna be a lot of fun.
[63:59.53]I can't wait.
[64:03.17]Just play the regular Sims.
[64:08.11]Oh man, hold on a minute.
[64:09.19]Okay, we're good.
[64:11.56]Mod spam?
[64:12.42]What was the mod spam?
[64:14.05]Oh, it just was doing the heart.
[64:15.03]Hey, thanks.
[64:19.31]Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic.
[64:20.83]I have heard that Spider-Man is absolutely remarkably fun.
[64:28.04]I got donated $50 earlier?
[64:29.90]I think we touched upon it.
[64:31.36]No, we didn't.
[64:34.00]I was locked into my face being torn apart.
[64:37.44]Never Trust a Purple gave $50.
[64:40.68]Thank you so much, Never Trust a Purple.
[64:43.22]And Purple says, I thought you said we weren't playing sport.
[64:52.14]This is going to make it worse.
[64:53.86]Thank you, Purple.
[64:58.18]That made it worse.
[65:04.23]I don't know why my hair does that.
[65:06.37]Why does my hair do this?
[65:07.79]And I just want it to go to one side.
[65:10.47]Do a bird in a painting.
[65:15.13]That's a bird in a painting.
[65:17.17]The mountain, the trees, the birds.
[65:21.24]Just draw that five times.
[65:29.78]So style it.
[65:30.58]I don't like putting product in my hair.
[65:32.26]It makes me greasy up here and I break out of my forehead.
[65:35.77]Doesn't matter what it is.
[65:36.65]It makes me sweat.
[65:37.99]If I put product in my hair, I sweat.
[65:41.15]Like profusely on my hairline.
[65:43.91]And then I wake up after showering.
[65:47.79]And then holy shit, man.
[65:49.05]There's like pimple, pimple, pimple, zit, zit, zit.
[65:51.64]It's just, I don't know.
[65:52.60]I don't want to do that.
[65:54.12]I can't do it.
[65:59.34]Showering.
[66:00.30]Showering.
[66:02.04]Showering.
[66:04.81]Shower, showering.
[66:06.07]What's wrong with the way I'm saying showering?
[66:09.19]No, my skin's been pretty clear.
[66:10.65]I've been eating lots of garlic.
[66:12.03]I've been... One, two, you know, talked about it before.
[66:17.06]Eat more garlic.
[66:17.70]You'll thank me when you're 30.
[66:20.70]My birthday's like tomorrow.
[66:22.34]When is my birthday?
[66:26.02]Fuck.
[66:31.76]My birthday's like next week.
[66:35.56]What is it now?
[66:37.04]I'm turning, oh man, I don't like this.
[66:39.68]I'm turning the wrong age.
[66:42.89]I'm turning the age where it's the percentage age.
[66:48.61]The third of your life is gone.
[66:50.57]That's what I'm turning.
[66:51.80]No, that would imply that I'm gonna live to be 100.
[66:53.28]I'm not gonna live to be 100.
[66:58.12]Fuck man, I'm really getting that old?
[67:00.24]That's why my whole body hurts.
[67:04.36]I'm hitting that percentage age where 33% of your life, that's a third of your life if you live to be 99.
[67:12.05]How long am I gonna live?
[67:13.05]I've already done my whole life.
[67:16.07]I need more.
[67:18.49]Science is gonna progress and we're gonna be like robots.
[67:20.49]33.3, so that means I'd have to turn 33.
[67:31.08]And then three months go by.
[67:32.30]That's when I have to be concerned.
[67:33.38]Okay, that's fine.
[67:34.94]I can deal with that.
[67:42.96]I'm not going online and typing in that, like, what date are you going to die?
[67:47.96]I'm not doing that.
[67:49.40]I did that once and I'll never do it again.
[67:52.02]Back when I was in high school or something.
[67:53.18]I'm not doing it.
[68:00.36]Fine, I'll do it.
[68:01.94]God damn it.
[68:03.78]What is it?
[68:04.26]This website has existed.
[68:08.36]This website has been around since like 1995.
[68:13.22]Have they updated this website?
[68:14.88]Which one is the right one?
[68:15.71]There's like fucking 10 of these.
[68:19.69]There are five death clock Google... There's five webpages on the front page.
[68:29.57]Which one of these isn't like a ad profile scam?
[68:38.33]What's the right one?
[68:43.11]They're all the same thing.
[68:49.87]Alright, well, this is a USA Today article.
[68:52.32]Alright, well, I clicked it.
[68:56.26]That means it's like the ring.

[69:28.26]I am NOT sadistic.
[69:29.36]I am very normal or pessimistic at worst I'm not sadistic.
[69:37.87]How am I sadistic?
[69:40.35]What have I ever done that's been sadistic?
[69:46.15]No, I'm not too optimistic, but I'm not too sadistic.

[71:14.80]These things are a scam.
[71:15.74]I just gave this guy my fucking information.
[71:17.96]That's all this is.
[71:19.69]Hey, let's collect birthdays and get ad profiles.
[71:22.57]And put cookies on their fucking browser.
[71:25.77]Good.
[71:29.70]74.
[71:30.14]No, that's not... Just refresh it and get a new date.
[71:35.82]Until it's a desirable one.
[71:37.08]I agree.

I don't like that 23 number that's that's the evil number right
[72:14.83]I'm going to eat like a bunch of cheeseburgers tonight.
[72:16.45]I'm going to get to 24.
[72:18.20]Anything under 25 is fine.
[72:19.34]I don't want to be 23.
[72:22.00]23 is that evil number.
[72:22.90]They did a Jim Carrey movie about it where he was like a murderer or something, right?
[72:31.27]Yeah, I'm going to gain like 10 pounds just so I can make sure I don't have the Jim Carrey number.
[72:37.57]I should watch 23 on stream.
[72:43.13]That's not going to happen.
[72:45.83]I'm interested.
[72:46.54]Oh.
[72:46.76]What?
[72:46.90]See?
[72:46.98]See?
[73:15.29]Do you understand?
[73:16.00]And everyone was giving me shit about this.
[73:17.74]Did you hear what this guy just said?
[73:19.98]He just did the thing that I told you was the annoying thing to do.
[73:23.60]Whoa.
[73:24.06]Yeah.
[73:24.68]Oh, it's established in two since 2014.
[73:28.17]Oh, it's long time.
[73:29.85]I'm glad we just got to see that in real time.
[73:32.23]App store years phases broke the top five of the app store and it now has over 6 million downloads and even
[73:39.92]It's not that much.
[73:40.64]Cooler than that, it actually helped launch our game business, which now has over 65 million downloads.
[73:46.33]That's kind of good.
[73:47.95]That's good.
[73:49.25]I mean, that's a respect.
[73:50.39]That's a great number.
[73:51.83]We've made a lot of hyper-casual games like The Pit, The Lion's Den, In the Sky, Blue Edge, and more.
[73:59.13]And you'll notice all these games are simple.
[74:00.71]In fact, Phases was made in only two weeks without coding.
[74:04.47]I made that and I don't know how to code.
[74:05.91]I'm not even a graphic designer.
[74:12.01]Just me and this guy look the same.
[74:15.49]We have the same kind of haircut.
[74:21.39]I don't want to show it.
[74:21.99]What did I even click on?
[74:24.59]I don't even remember.
[74:30.63]Oh, this is the number 23 math scene.
[74:37.74]Maybe it was just a coincidence.
[74:40.34]I mean, a name is just a name, and a number is just a number.
[74:47.09]Isn't it?
[74:58.07]This is not, I'm not even doing anything.
[74:59.81]I just put on glasses and watched a video that you can't see.
[75:03.67]You can't see this video.
[75:08.13]It's self-printed, self-published, and it's by an author I've never heard.
[75:13.69]Look, I can go, I got a bunch of looks.
[75:16.71]You don't think I have like a million different looks?
[75:18.65]Look, I got this look.
[75:20.17]Looks pretty good.
[75:21.36]This is like smart guy, but also in a second, in a second, I can go from, I could go right to Ghostbusters librarian.
[75:33.81]Right?
[75:34.25]That's extreme.
[75:37.31]I got so many looks.
[75:39.17]Like this looks bad.
[75:42.96]This looks like... Okay.
[75:44.58]No, that looks bad.
[75:45.18]This looks bad.
[75:46.20]No, this one is the one that looks bad.
[75:48.28]This one looks good.
[75:49.86]This one looks alright.
[75:51.82]What about up here?
[75:56.23]Look at how much more attractive I am when they're up there.
[76:01.03]Yeah, like I got glasses, but...
[76:03.69]I don't really need them.
[76:04.69]I'm just going to put them up there just in case I need to read something.
[76:08.85]Like your number.
[76:10.83]And then right when she starts to get the number book out and you're like, okay, got it.
[76:15.27]Right to the librarian.
[76:17.21]Are you sure?
[76:24.62]Like she's like, oh, hey, yeah, just me.
[76:27.16]It's just me here.
[76:28.96]Yeah, I'll take that number.
[76:30.00]Yeah, and what is that? 555.
[76:34.18]Two, two, four.
[76:37.42]Oh no!
[76:38.36]And she's fucking sprints away.
[76:52.70]I'm not, why, I stopped doing this.
[76:55.60]What am I doing?
[76:56.16]This is not even a live stream.
[76:57.32]There's just a guy playing audio through his headphones.
[77:09.79]A reaction.
[77:10.29]Yeah, this is a reaction video, but it's rea- no, it's a reaction audio.
[77:13.49]This is reaction audio.
[77:16.28]Hey, listen to this.
[77:17.08]Can you hear the guy typing?
[77:18.08]Hold on.
[77:19.16]God, fucking, whatever.
[77:34.49]This is, this is only gonna be funny for like 10 seconds.
[77:39.91]But I'm in the IRL section, and I have to be there for a few minutes doing this.
[77:45.39]I need to make people uncomfortable for a few minutes that come to the stream accidentally, and they never come back ever again.
[77:50.83]Just give me a minute.
[78:03.38]Just hold on.
[78:05.30]OK, I need to add.
[78:58.39]Okay.
[78:59.25]I gotta drop this a little.
[79:03.78]There's so many face cams here.
[79:05.22]I don't know which is the right one.
[79:08.91]I don't know which is the right facecam.
[79:11.37]There it is.
[79:40.20]Okay, here we go.
[83:24.16]Alright.
[83:27.88]Why is this still playing?
[83:32.09]Let's see what it says.
[83:33.41]What did I get?
[83:34.21]What did I write in my novel?
[83:35.59]Let's see.
[83:39.11]She went.
[83:40.44]That's it.
[83:54.12]I don't think I was cut out for this.
[84:04.98]Centuries.
[84:13.53]She went home.
[84:14.13]The end.
[84:17.11]Don't touch my hair.
[84:18.27]I feel like I just wiped lipstick all over my face.
[84:20.43]Alright.
[84:22.76]So how many people left, do you think?
[84:25.45]3,300 people here.
[84:27.47]Was anybody keeping track of like, did it go to like, did it go to like 330 and then come down to like 329?
[84:31.71]It gained viewers.
[84:38.41]We gained a hundred.
[84:40.11]Somebody came in and was just like, I don't, I'm leaving forever.
[84:47.92]Two people left when I sat back down.
[84:54.58]How do I make this right?
[84:56.04]There we go.
[84:59.78]This is going to be off for the rest of the stream.
[85:01.38]I can't fix it.
[85:03.62]No contrast at all.
[85:05.00]Alright, let's do the thing where I'm going to make it so I look way better than I really do.
[85:13.44]You ready?
[85:13.78]Let's put the exposure up a lot to a point where I'm almost completely blown out.
[85:18.49]And then we're going to put the contrast up a shitload.
[85:24.73]and then put the color intensity down and drop the gain.
[85:37.23]So that's what this looks like, right?
[85:41.35]This is what I really look like.
[85:50.14]Hey.
[86:00.04]Oops.
[86:06.97]This is still silence is appreciated.
[86:09.05]I got to get rid of that.
[86:11.99]That's not the one I need to delete.
[86:19.76]I'm going to keep this one though.
[86:22.68]That's staying.
[86:24.56]Silence is appreciated right now.
[86:29.23]I need to make more mosaic memes.
[86:30.85]I can't do the same thing twice.
[86:35.34]I lost 100 viewers because of that.
[86:37.52]I don't know.
[86:37.96]It's hard to decide.
[86:38.88]It's hard to determine.
[86:39.60]Am I in Vegas?
[86:42.52]I am not in Vegas now.
[86:43.54]There are enough people.
[86:44.14]Let's talk about it.
[86:44.96]Fine.
[86:45.16]Here we go.
[86:47.68]No, I'm not.
[86:48.50]I'm still in my original house.
[86:52.85]Got a place in Vegas.
[86:55.23]Now, the process is, now that I have a place in Las Vegas, the process now begins to go there from here.
[87:05.63]It's going to take a couple weeks.
[87:08.63]Still in Ann Arbor, Boston.
[87:10.97]Yeah.
[87:13.19]Still in Orlando, yeah.
[87:14.33]And I'll be able to beat the boss and get out of here soon.
[87:15.76]$200,000 down.
[87:15.88]That would be like a $20 to $30 million house.
[87:27.61]No.
[87:31.28]Where in Vegas?
[87:33.46]Las Vegas.
[87:37.04]Las Vegas.
[87:45.42]Las, comma, Vegas.
[87:52.83]He bought a casino.
[87:56.95]I did.
[87:59.95]It's going to be the, I can't say that because that's illegal.
[88:08.05]I was going to just make like a formal fake announcement.
[88:10.71]Are you allowed to say things and then pretend that they're real?
[88:14.12]No, that's called, you can't do that, I don't think.
[88:15.96]Yes, you can.
[88:18.74]WWF exists.
[88:20.32]They just, they pretend it's real, right?
[88:25.66]I could get sued.
[88:27.75]well lying is not illegal no I'm talking about like but like trademark infringement is like if I told you guys right now that I I currently owned the WWE that would be a that would be a 100 lie and I could probably get like in trouble for saying that if I didn't uh put the that end there on there right like if I you can't just do that you can't do that all it would take is a phone call and I would be ruined
[89:03.52]But I own Doom.
[89:04.78]But that, yeah, but that was clearly a joke.
[89:07.08]If I was, if I just came on the stream and I was like, guys, got a big announcement.
[89:12.40]Yep.
[89:13.82]Mm-hmm.
[89:16.28]Uh, I own, I own the Doom franchise now.
[89:21.44]I bought it.
[89:22.34]Like that's a, like that's a 100% fake lie.
[89:25.26]Me making a bunch of jokes about Doom and like, oh, I'm Mr. Doom.
[89:28.18]Like that's, that's different.
[89:29.42]You can't just do that.
[89:35.79]No, I bought it.
[89:41.74]A fake lie?
[89:42.82]No.
[89:43.88]Yeah.
[89:44.68]That's, I mean... Do you understand that there are people that lie?
[89:50.75]That don't, like, are not trying to... I don't know how either doing it...
[90:01.36]Are you happy?
[90:01.72]Are you happy you got the onions?
[90:03.08]Are you happy you got the onions?
[90:04.62]Crispy onions.
[90:05.12]Are you happy you got the onions?
[90:07.20]This is what you guys wanted.
[90:08.21]I'm not clicking that link.
[90:23.92]I'm not clicking the link.
[90:24.74]You can stop spamming it.
[90:25.72]I'm not going to click it.
[90:29.00]I'm not clicking that link.
[90:30.42]I'm not going to do it.
[90:32.28]I appreciate this thing right here that's at the bottom of the page.
[90:36.68]I appreciate that talking to you.
[90:43.05]I'm not going to click it.
[90:43.93]I already know what it is.
[91:14.61]Jeremy, you are going to die at 73.
[91:17.57]Have fun while it lasts, old man.
[91:19.83]Let's talk about this because this is important.
[91:40.25]Is there a reason why we've come so far in text to speech?
[91:47.14]They sound very natural.
[91:48.18]It used to be Microsoft, SAM.
[91:50.44]They adapt to, they've created these incredible AI devices that can read very naturally.
[91:56.68]Why have they not just made laughing sound remotely accurate, right?
[92:01.81]No laugh is accurate.
[92:04.37]It goes like .
[92:07.79]Technology's not far enough to make somebody go like .
[92:12.23]Why is it like that?
[92:22.02]Text to speech, I'll give you the perfect example.
[92:26.72]This is the best one, right?
[92:27.78]This is the one that everybody, natural readers, right?
[92:31.26]They're very, very, it sounds like a guy or a girl actually talking to you.
[92:37.62]With punctuation, inflection.
[92:39.46]Just for an example.
[92:59.22]Okay.
[93:00.18]We're just going to do Gabriella.
[93:01.68]That's fine.
[93:04.04]I am actually talking.
[93:05.08]Listen to my great voice.
[93:06.52]There is one issue, though.
[93:07.49]Okay.
[93:08.71]Listen to how I do this.
[93:09.73]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[93:12.15]No, that's incorrect.
[93:13.03]That's not right.
[93:19.24]I am actually talking.
[93:20.28]Listen to my great voice.
[93:21.72]There is one issue, though.
[93:23.96]Listen to how I do this.
[93:25.00]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[93:28.42]Everything was so fine and accurate until they left.
[93:31.46]Why can't you just put in like laugh in brackets and they can pre-record a laugh?
[93:42.44]And they don't do emojis either.
[93:43.64]I'm doing a smiley face here.
[93:44.66]They haven't figured that out.
[93:51.58]It won't do it.
[93:55.14]Can I, does that work?
[93:57.83]That doesn't work, right?
[93:59.59]If you put laugh in brackets or laughs in brackets, it doesn't do anything, right?
[94:04.76]Why is insert on?
[94:05.76]No one's ever used it.
[94:08.46]Laughs.
[94:10.16]Nothing.
[94:11.82]Or a scream, right?
[94:14.50]No one, they haven't figured out that if somebody writes A-H-H-H-H-H, it should be a scream?
[94:20.49]Uh.
[94:21.69]That was with like 14 H's.
[94:23.99]Let's add even more.
[94:28.71]Okay, this has taken up almost the whole box at this point of A and H. Anybody else do it differently?
[94:38.62]What about like Sharon?
[94:42.11]Okay, that was just like a Twitch donation.
[94:43.57]Sorry.
[94:43.73]Sorry, I just donated like $3 to somebody.
[94:45.39]Sorry about that.
[95:10.80]But that wouldn't be a problem if this was a... Play more funny TTS.
[95:21.73]Does this still do anything?
[95:23.67]People used to come into TeamSpeak and do this shit.
[95:26.01]And it would ruin raids.
[95:28.29]I remember just being like, we need to change our password for our TeamSpeak.
[95:34.47]Or Ventrilo, whatever the hell we used in our guild.
[95:36.57]Because people would come in and do this.
[95:44.73]It won't even do it.
[95:46.61]It knows.
[95:49.52]It just was left square bracket, right square bracket, left bracket, right bracket, left bracket, right bracket, left square bracket, left bracket, right bracket, and it would do that for like 40 minutes.
[96:03.13]Oh my god, it was horrible.
[96:15.54]What does my rufflecopter sound like?
[96:17.45]Alright, but that's... Let's get out of there.
[96:22.35]Let me look up... Let me look up... Okay.
[96:36.35]That's kind of interesting.
[96:37.13]I didn't know that, like, natural readers were that sophisticated.
[97:04.51]If you have a shedding dog it means that they need more omega-3 that's interesting I guess Cool
[97:33.18]I was going to do something.
[97:34.30]You can't do that on Twitch.
[97:35.66]But that's like... You know what I'm saying.
[97:39.54]If I stand up, I'm not going to even say it.
[97:42.54]But imagine the comedy that would be there for that one.
[97:48.17]Hold on.
[97:51.99]I've got to write a paper.
[97:52.93]I've got a paper due in like two minutes.
[97:55.29]Oh shit, I forgot.
[97:56.11]I know that I have more dexterity with my feet.
[98:16.29]What's wrong with my knee?
[98:17.13]You don't like my knee?
[98:19.45]You got a problem?

[99:21.93]I just need the big cartoon hammer and I'm ready to go.
[99:23.75]Am I sweating through this?

[123:30.03]Let me just take it out of the box here, out of the foam.
[123:33.67]It's a nice foam packaging too.
[123:36.95]Okay.
[123:38.61]Hmm, I like what they did with the buttons here.

[123:47.80]This is really awesome, guys.
[123:50.42]Like the video and favorite the video and share it with all your friends because I took a piece of electronics out of a box, a thing that a four-year-old could actually just do and that's it.
[124:01.47]Just please share this with everybody you know because you saw a controller on screen.
[124:05.01]By the way, as quickly as we unboxed it, let's put it back in and never take it out ever again.
[124:11.40]Because that's what's going to happen.
[124:13.02]Thank you for sending that to me, whoever that was.
[124:15.74]Thank you.
[124:24.15]Smooch.

[125:46.01]This is getting concerning.
[125:48.77]What's that term?
[125:49.61]You must be new around here.
[125:52.72]Like, we draw with permanent marker on ourselves.
[125:55.30]I'm not going to do that.
[125:56.60]You're not going to get that shit from me.
[126:02.88]New comb street?

[126:10.94]I'm getting meaner, what?
[126:12.64]Why am I meaner?
[126:13.52]I'm just poking fun at something.
[126:16.20]That's not mean, that's just... Isn't that interesting?
[126:20.57]That's it.

[126:35.33]Like, no thanks.
[126:37.69]I'm getting old, I'm turning 33.
[126:41.80]I am a bundle of joy.
[126:44.61]I am a bag of confetti for a 33-year-old, I'll tell you.
[126:49.05]Hangman on my chest.
[126:52.15]That'll get the TOS swimming around, won't it?
[126:59.86]You could pass as 16.
[127:02.76]I was getting carded.
[127:05.82]We were at the casinos and people were just like, excuse me, can I see your ID?
[127:09.92]And it's like, yeah.
[127:11.86]And they look at it and it's like, okay, here you go.
[127:20.81]See, that's fine.
[127:22.09]You think I'm going to complain about that?
[127:23.43]People that go, well, you look young.
[127:25.07]Okay, talk to me when I'm 50 and I look 35.
[127:29.37]Talk to me then.
[127:34.35]I'll be one of those people on the red carpet and it's just like, how does he do it?
[127:40.78]And I'll just go look in the camera and I'll say the same thing I told you guys like two or three hours ago.
[127:45.54]Eat more garlic.
[127:47.14]Don't, and eat a bunch, start taking in more honey and eat your vitamins.
[127:52.11]And don't get them from a pill.
[127:53.21]Get them from the natural sources.
[127:56.33]Gotta eat more garlic.
[127:57.05]That's it.
[127:57.27]Eat more garlic and you'll win.
[127:59.11]It's like putting on cheat codes in Fortnite.
[128:01.37]You like that game?
[128:02.05]I've heard you liked it.
[128:02.71]Imagine you could eat garlic in Fortnite?
[128:04.93]Oh boy, you'd be getting 20 extra fucking KDR right there.
[128:12.15]You look 90.
[128:18.29]Stop.
[128:21.75]Calm down.
[128:25.16]What?
[128:25.82]I'm letting loose, okay?
[128:27.20]I'm in a good mood.
[128:28.08]I'm in a great mood because I'm moving across the country and it's fucking happening.
[128:31.44]I'm out of here.
[128:32.56]I'm telling you, I'm obviously taking these things with me.
[128:34.18]I'm taking that.
[128:35.82]I'm taking that.
[128:36.64]I'm taking that.
[128:37.32]I'm taking that.
[128:37.90]And that's all coming with me.
[128:38.78]And it's going to be great.
[128:40.50]My first stream from Las Vegas.
[128:43.02]Ooh, it's gonna be fun.
[128:44.48]I'm gonna like pop open champagne and just drink it.
[128:47.59]The first stream from the Las Vegas house is not gonna be like me playing Minecraft.
[128:52.81]I don't play Minecraft.
[128:53.75]Do you understand what I'm saying?
[128:54.49]It's gonna be like, pop the bottles, we're in Vegas.
[128:59.43]Not gonna be a comb stream.
[129:00.34]It's gonna be a bottle of champagne stream that I hold in my hand.
[129:06.94]It's why you're a vampire.
[129:08.56]Why do vampires look so young?
[129:11.22]It's because they consume blood.
[129:15.24]Why would I be moving to Vegas if I was a vampire?
[129:17.62]It's like the anti-vampire city.
[129:28.26]When did they add champagne to Minecraft?
[129:34.08]That's what they want you to think?
[129:35.54]Who?
[129:36.70]Who's they in this scenario?
[129:38.13]Me?
[129:38.39]Yeah, that's what they want you to think.
[129:41.73]Germans being controlled.
[129:48.14]I think it would be... Think about like the time... I would have lost all of my sponsors on this stream.
[129:53.93]If I had any sponsors... This is how you guys can tell that I don't have any sponsors.
[129:57.07]Because I would have lost all of them.
[130:02.21]On this stream.
[130:09.10]Sellout.
[130:13.12]Go into your Discord.
[130:14.46]I'm not going to do that.
[130:15.18]It's probably people screaming.
[130:17.15]If I had to guess what was... Okay, there's a voice chat here with like 70 people in it and all of them are screaming.
[130:22.47]I guarantee there's just loud screaming here.
[130:24.48]I'm not going to go in here.
[130:28.46]I already know what it is.
[130:35.85]I'm going in.
[130:36.83]How many people can even go in?
[130:37.85]I shouldn't have said that.
[130:38.71]Now it's going to be even... I'm sorry I did that.
[130:45.36]Can I put my arm down?
[130:46.26]You guys got the thing I was doing?
[130:54.54]I'm not gonna die on July 4th, 2059.
[130:56.45]Not gonna happen.
[130:57.67]Close that.
[131:01.57]I lost the Discord sponsor.
[131:07.71]When do I move?
[131:08.23]The 1st.
[131:08.61]October 1st.
[131:10.17]That's when the process is done.
[131:12.95]I should be...
[131:15.17]in my house in Las Vegas, October 1st, 2022.
[131:22.81]No, 18.
[131:29.13]Oh, Yahoo, right?
[131:30.07]Yahoo.
[131:31.11]Yahoo.
[131:33.29]They still do that?
[131:33.83]Do Yahoo still have commercials?
[131:37.79]Yahoo commercial 2018.
[131:44.83]What?
[131:45.03]Should I buy Yahoo?
[131:46.27]Do you think I could afford it?
[132:06.29]This is two old people eating soup.
[132:08.89]That's this whole commercial.
[132:09.79]There's a monkey on a guy's shoulder.
[132:11.79]And there's a toucan on her shoulder.
[132:17.88]That's what I was looking for.
[132:18.86]That's what I was looking for.
[132:19.54]That's what I wanted to hear.
[132:20.32]I wonder how much it would cost to acquire Yahoo under Jerma.85 Enterprises.
[132:32.96]What if it was like a Jerma nine, eight, five had the it's Jerma nine, eight, five's live stream.
[132:38.46]And you, you who, and that's you who incorporated how much of the, I'm going to buy the whole drink company.
[132:44.37]Are they still making drinks?
[132:53.73]Yeah.
[132:56.82]Those things are such, those things are trash by the way.
[133:01.40]You want to know what Yoohoo is?
[133:03.24]It's water, corn syrup, and whey.
[133:07.96]It's a water, sugar, chocolate.
[133:10.56]It's worse than a Coke.
[133:14.60]You drink like two Cokes, you probably drank one Yoohoo.
[133:22.39]But it tastes great.
[133:23.23]Yeah, I used to drink Yoohoo all the time.
[133:24.79]I loved it.
[133:26.09]If there was a Yoohoo in my hand right now, I would drink it.
[133:27.81]I think I drank a Yoohoo on stream like six months ago.
[133:31.60]Didn't I show it on stream and I was like, hey, I'm drinking this.
[133:33.52]Did you guess right?
[133:36.48]I think I did.
[133:38.34]So I've drank one in the last six months.
[133:40.16]You want me to be the hypocrite here?
[133:41.98]I'm not.
[133:42.28]I just think that things are bad for you.
[133:44.58]Just water and sugar.
[133:45.56]That's it.
[133:47.41]People think it's milk.
[133:48.55]Oh, I'm going to get a chocolate milk for my son.
[133:50.67]No, it's water with sugar dumped into it.
[133:57.71]That's grounds for a sponsorship.
[134:00.33]Give me a call.
[134:01.95]Yahoo.
[134:04.51]I probably won't answer.
[134:06.44]I might be asleep when you call and I won't call back because I don't do that.
[134:12.54]If a number that I don't know calls me, I look at it waking up and I go, I don't care.
[134:17.74]And I put it down and then I never call them back.
[134:21.57]And every time that I have answered a call that I didn't know, it was somebody telling me that I had a virus and I needed to go to my computer and they were Windows tech support.
[134:31.81]So, I mean, that's happened like a bunch of times.
[134:44.10]Scammers.
[134:45.76]I actually got a call from somebody that
[134:49.82]They were looking for somebody.
[134:51.24]They dialed the number wrong, and it was, like, the greatest voicemail ever.
[134:54.06]But I'm not going to play it because there's way too much, like, personal information.
[134:57.73]But this guy was an old man, and he dialed the wrong fucking number.
[135:00.43]It was so funny.
[135:02.39]He's just like, I just want to tell you, I got a cancel on you.
[135:05.93]And I'm like, wait a minute, what the fuck is a cancel on me?
[135:10.81]I figured out that he he said he said three times in the call.
[135:13.91]I really hope this is the right number It's like I want to call him back be like hey, I want to make sure you know man It was wrong and I'm sorry He was trying to cancel his Twitch sub I'm not going in the Discord.
[135:35.48]It's gonna be a it's gonna be a zoo in here.
[135:37.42]I
[135:42.18]Why are people in the tabletop games?
[135:43.94]There's no one playing tabletop games in here.
[135:47.43]Guarantee it.
[135:55.77]No one in here is playing tabletop games.
[136:03.06]See?
[136:03.74]I don't hear any dice rolls going on in here.
[136:07.22]I don't hear any, like, yeah, if you pass, go collect $200 in here.
[136:17.40]That guy that guy must have that guy must have just rolled a two and got to Park Place because why have one of the reactions of the tabletop games Well time it before hours, holy fuck what the hell that it's room before and almost four hours plus I

[137:40.54]Fine.
[137:42.26]Bob.
[137:44.98]Little Bob's birthday is tomorrow.
[137:48.59]He's turning three.
[137:49.73]Little Bob.
[137:58.29]Is there a channel update because Spider-Man?
[138:02.38]I was going to do it, but I...
[138:04.39]I don't know if I can do that.
[138:05.45]I feel like people would just be like... That would make a lot of people angry, I think.
[138:11.10]I just saw a bug.
[138:16.22]I cleaned this place vigorously.
[138:19.76]Alright, I think it's time to go to bed.
[138:24.51]I'm back.
[138:28.43]Spider on table.
[138:31.66]Yeah, I think it's time we said goodnight.
[138:34.58]I'm gonna go to the birthday.
[138:35.68]Monday, we're gonna get back into playing games and doing stuff.
[138:42.19]And I have to try as hard as I can to do something very important before I leave.
[138:48.23]We're gonna do a stream that is hopefully a goodbye stream from here.
[138:54.29]And it'll be enough effort where it'll be worth watching.
[138:57.21]And it'll give, obviously, a nice little segue into moving to Las Vegas.
[139:01.41]So I'm working on it.
[139:08.70]And yes, I want to reiterate this again.
[139:12.36]October 1st is the day that is the move-in.
[139:15.72]And that whole week of the first week of October is going to be moving in.
[139:20.14]There'll be streams.
[139:21.18]I'm not just going to not stream.
[139:22.80]It just really depends on when my computer gets there.
[139:25.20]That's the number one.
[139:26.08]And if my computer does not get there on the time of arrival, then I'll have to do some Pringles reviews where I review Pringles.
[139:33.77]I mean, that was pretty redundant, but you know what I mean.
[139:36.81]So, I will see you all on Monday.
[139:43.43]We'll do Monday.
[139:44.33]We'll go all through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[139:49.57]And with that, let's get to the credits.

[145:16.24]Add browser.
[145:26.13]I don't know what quality camera Mark has, but he looks amazing.
[145:30.57]Having a cigarette?
[145:32.59]Yeah, sometimes I like to smoke down here.
[145:34.59]This is exciting, because now it's like a challenge, you know?
[145:37.69]I'm that psychopathic person that needs a challenge to everything.
[145:41.70]Against another person, of course.
[145:43.02]If it's a challenge to myself, then I always win.
[145:55.37]Oh, that was a headshot.
[145:57.85]I guess this means I'm winning.
[145:59.05]I didn't even... What happened?
[146:00.45]Cigarette?
[146:01.64]Yeah.
[146:02.12]Sometimes I like to smoke down here.
[146:04.18]Okay, that was pretty funny.
[146:06.36]Can I get a replay on that one?
[146:08.86]Okay, was that good?
[146:11.64]Turn the ad off.
[146:12.76]I can't turn off ads.
[146:14.26]That gives... Come on, creators.
[146:17.18]I'm supporting a creator.
[146:20.73]And cut.
[146:25.70]That's... I did not... Yeah, that's kind of... Those are two famous people.
[146:29.70]And that's me cackling like a psycho.
[146:42.68]I have ads blocked on your videos.
[146:47.16]Oh, yeah?
[146:49.85]Cut that right there.
[146:55.53]Thank you.
[146:56.61]That's cool.
[147:00.59]I've never met either of these two people.
[147:02.83]I've seen Markiplier at an arcade across the arcade.
[147:07.85]We were at the same place.
[147:09.63]We were at the same place.
[147:11.18]I didn't find him.
[147:12.52]We were just at the same location and I saw him playing an arcade game and I was like, that's Markiplier.
[147:16.06]That's cool.
[147:20.60]Didn't say anything to him, but
[147:23.44]That's cool, I guess.
[147:24.86]Seems like a really nice guy.
[147:25.60]Alright.
[147:37.10]Thank you for that.
[147:37.56]That was interesting.
[147:39.78]I saw Farkiplier at the grocery store one time.
[147:42.58]Yeah, and he looked at like this in front of my face.
[147:45.69]And I think he was scanning items that, you know, yeah, I don't have to say it.
[147:50.09]Thank you, Free iPod.
[147:52.44]For the $1.
[147:53.70]Welcome back.
[147:54.50]Good to be back.
[147:56.56]Thank you, Free iPod.
[147:57.24]Thank you, Gaming Hash, for the $8.42.
[147:58.40]Hey, Jeremiah, I'm in high school and I would like to play trombone for a living because I enjoy it, but I'm nervous.
[148:05.50]Any tips on career choices?
[148:10.45]On playing the trombone, I can't really give you musical advice because I don't, all I know is I played the drums very poorly.
[148:20.01]I can do that.
[148:20.73]I can go like this.
[148:27.60]I fucking was on I did a class for that one time That was off the cuff with to this and not a good environment.
[148:34.76]I need like a couple of other longer sticks But thank you gaming hash what I could tell you is do try to do what you want to do But always have something that you know you can do right and
[148:50.99]You've got like the thing that you want to try to do, that one that you're going to strive for, and it's like one of your dreams, right?
[148:56.27]But have another thing that you know that you're good at, that you know that you can do.
[149:01.58]Your life will be so much easier that way.
[149:12.25]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[149:17.44]I can't really give you music advice though, because I don't really know anything about the field.
[149:23.40]Says the guy with no backup plans.
[149:25.19]No, actually my backup, you know what my backup plan was?
[149:28.43]Was I was going to be customer service on the phone.
[149:30.39]Like I wanted to be like a customer service representative and do that for like a living.
[149:35.25]Answering phones and that's like what I wanted to do if I didn't like do this.
[149:39.62]I did wedding videography, but that was kind of hell.
[149:47.61]But I talk too much.
[149:50.01]And I know I talk too much.
[149:51.05]I talk all fucking goddamn day.
[149:53.67]You can never shut me up.
[149:54.61]So I was like, okay, if all I do is talk, then why wouldn't I want to do something where I just get to do that all day?
[150:02.70]Or teaching.
[150:03.56]Teaching was another thing I wanted to be able to do.
[150:04.98]I did substitute teaching.
[150:07.88]Talked over the wedding video.
[150:09.42]Can you imagine like, oh, this is a good shot.
[150:11.76]You know, the thing about, let me like zoom in.
[150:14.88]Yeah, that's a beautiful gown.
[150:16.96]Don't you think?
[150:17.52]Holy shit.
[150:18.99]I can't even imagine doing that to somebody.
[150:23.26]But like, honest to God, you're able to sleep so much better at night when you know that you have the dream and then you have the thing that you know that you can do now or in the near future, right?
[150:36.41]And you can still do this while working on this, right?
[150:40.71]It doesn't have to be one or the other.
[150:42.77]Like when I first made my first YouTube video, I was still doing this, right?
[150:46.62]Just doing whatever.
[150:48.24]You can still do this while you work on this.
[150:55.10]Jeremiah filmed my wedding.
[150:58.15]That's interesting.
[151:05.06]Jazz hands?
[151:06.60]Yeah, you can still do this.

[151:24.64]I wish you luck.
[151:26.44]Hey, dog memes.
[151:27.48]Thanks for the $1.
[151:28.26]Here's money.
[151:28.80]Get booze and gamble.
[151:29.82]Funny joke.
[151:32.92]Why am I so... Okay, anybody a doctor in here?
[151:37.69]I got to ask a question.
[151:38.83]Is somebody actually a doctor for real?
[151:44.23]I need to know this.
[151:47.06]Well, one of you guys has a dad that's, or like a mom that's a doctor, right?
[151:52.42]Somebody statistically has to have a doctor here.
[151:58.83]Alright, well, I've got like, I'm really like gassy lately.
[152:02.53]Bloated, gassy, and I got a lot of back pain.
[152:06.67]Ask your mother.
[152:09.63]Ask like your dad, like that's a doctor, and just be like, pretend it's like, you know, some guy on the internet just needs a diagnosis.
[152:15.64]What's wrong with me?
[152:22.81]I'm getting old.
[152:24.59]I knew that already.
[152:25.49]That's not a diagnosis.
[152:30.62]I drink too much Coca-Cola.
[152:31.74]I don't drink any Coca-Cola.
[152:33.06]I drink a Coca-Cola once a year.
[152:34.66]Or maybe like twice a year.
[152:37.12]Well, twice a month, probably.
[152:38.20]Maybe like once or twice a week.
[152:41.74]If that.
[152:44.54]Cut back on the carbs.
[152:46.44]I mean, yeah, maybe.
[152:48.46]Thank you.
[152:48.84]Thank the doctor in the chat.
[152:52.40]But thank you, dog memes.
[152:53.12]Thank you, Peter, for the three bucks.
[152:54.26]The cool guy is back.
[152:56.06]Thank you, Peter.
[152:58.14]Or should I say, Peter?
[153:03.65]That was on camera, too.
[153:04.71]I forgot the camera was on here looking at me.
[153:09.63]Thank you, Ape, for the $2.50.
[153:10.70]I missed you, Dad.
[153:11.94]Missed you, too, son.
[153:14.17]Snicks Renegade, thank you for the $1.02.
[153:16.83]I was going through withdrawal when you left.
[153:19.01]I must have watched the Griffin State video 10,000 times over just to get my fix.
[153:26.99]I'm back.
[153:28.87]And I'm not going away again until, like, September 27th through October, like, 3rd.
[153:35.71]So I'm going away again, like, at the end of the month.
[153:47.52]I mean, I'm just being real.
[153:49.56]But thank you, Stix.
[153:50.86]Thank you, Emooch, for the two bucks.
[153:52.56]Hello, Jerm Boy.
[153:53.48]Hello.
[153:55.24]Hello, Emooch.
[153:56.56]How are you?
[153:57.14]Hey, Hall's back.
[153:57.96]Thanks for the $1.
[153:58.74]He's back.
[154:01.69]I am?
[154:03.99]Hey, Sly161, thanks for the $2.
[154:05.99]Welcome back.
[154:06.41]I just got Two Point Hospital today.
[154:08.07]You're going to have a lot of fun with it.
[154:09.77]I'd love to see more of these tycoon games in the future.
[154:13.13]Thank you, Sly161.
[154:13.81]Thank you.
[154:18.75]I would also like to do that.
[154:22.83]A lot of people in the chat room thought otherwise.
[154:30.04]It's a great, it's a good game.
[154:31.26]That's a fun game.
[154:32.10]And no one paid me to say that.
[154:33.14]I have to legally tell you if that's the case.
[154:38.11]I don't know, does somebody actually think that?
[154:40.95]Nobody thinks that, right?
[154:44.34]You know that I don't do that.
[154:46.06]You know that I don't do that.
[154:47.31]Why would you accuse me of that?
[154:51.93]Why did Chad hate that game so much?
[154:53.67]I don't know.
[154:55.97]Chad has like a very specific criteria for what they determine to be like a watchable game.
[155:01.41]And then sometimes it is a, a,
[155:04.79]pin point of difference where like a game or hate a game you got like no don't do it versus oh yeah and it could be like the tip of this comb difference it's too slow hospital game versus lego island wiki can't put those in the same category
[155:34.54]What am I using that comb on?
[155:37.04]My chest hair.
[155:40.66]It was a chill stream.
[155:41.60]Yeah, I mean, like, sometimes you... Oh, man.
[155:46.14]Just need to just hang out sometimes.
[155:49.75]That's it.
[155:52.75]You're old.
[155:53.51]No, you're old.
[155:54.41]I almost... Yeah, you're old.
[155:57.51]It's a whack game.
[156:00.19]I just... Everyone's got opinions.
[156:02.79]I can't tell you you're wrong.
[156:05.55]I can't tell you you're wrong.
[156:07.19]That's the thing.
[156:09.05]But you can't tell me that I'm wrong either.
[156:13.33]I like Infinity War.
[156:16.71]If you didn't like Infinity War, then you get to think that.
[156:20.79]But I'm not going to tell you that you're not allowed to not like that.
[156:23.01]To like that.
[156:23.71]But it's perversive.
[156:25.99]You're wrong.
[156:27.59]Whack.
[156:29.97]I just did this it's like trying it you can't you can't argue opinion it doesn't work if you had muscles you would be you'd make a pretty good bodyguard I used to look alright I had more viewers when I was fake typing
[157:00.44]That was a lot of fun.
[157:02.04]That was the most fun I've had probably all week.
[157:04.71]That was a blast.
[157:06.23]I loved having fun doing that.
[157:09.67]You used to be a Chad.
[157:13.49]But anyways, thank you.
[157:15.56]Thank you, Sly.
[157:16.72]Again, Two Point Hospital is a pretty fun game.
[157:20.36]Maybe we'll go back to it.
[157:22.96]I'll look into it.
[157:25.38]Hydra.
[157:25.80]Thanks, Hydra, for the $1.
[157:26.96]Hey, good to see you back.
[157:27.74]Did you meet Easy Pete in Vegas?
[157:29.26]I heard he's bet all his savings on 00.
[157:34.78]I did not see Easy Pete in Vegas.
[157:38.31]But he is the talk of the town here.
[157:42.69]Thank you, Hydra.
[157:43.29]Thank you, Arasul, for the $4.
[157:46.11]No message.
[157:46.59]Thank you, Arasul.
[157:48.21]Honeychain, thanks for the $1.
[157:49.35]Glad to have you back, Jeremy.
[157:50.10]Your streams always make me happy.
[157:51.28]I hope the moving process is going smoothly.
[157:56.63]There was some really, really stressful, kind of crazy shit that happened the first couple days we were there.
[158:04.63]Something that maybe one day we will talk about, right?
[158:07.83]Maybe one day we'll have like a, oh, what happened on the Vegas move stream type stuff.
[158:13.19]But for the purposes of, we're not going to go into that, right?
[158:17.05]We're not going to go into like step by step by step, this is what happened.
[158:20.23]You guys, it's always stressful, but...
[158:25.03]Maybe one day we'll talk about it.
[158:28.51]Maybe one day.
[158:29.97]But it is going as smooth as it could at this point.
[158:35.10]I appreciate it, though.
[158:35.74]Thank you so much.
[158:38.14]Thank you to Tom Sup for the $1.
[158:43.00]Glad you're back.
[158:43.72]Turn my heart right back at you.
[158:46.20]Not the back part, but the heart part.
[158:49.79]Thanks a lot.
[158:50.35]Thumbs up.
[158:51.53]Kill Code.
[158:52.07]Hey, Kill Code.
[158:52.53]Thanks for the $4.
[158:53.41]Welcome back, Jerma.
[158:54.37]Fireman stream sucks.
[159:02.59]I'm sorry.
[159:03.17]As you think that.
[159:04.63]Sorry you feel that way.
[159:07.31]Thank you, Kill Code.
[159:07.83]Thank you, Foot Powder Spray for the $10 here.
[159:11.69]My week is already a thousand times better just by seeing this stream.
[159:14.58]It's been a horrendous shit fest.
[159:17.50]I'm real thankful for everything you do for us.
[159:20.97]That is likewise.
[159:22.55]That goes both ways, man.
[159:24.99]Thank you for everything you do for me.
[159:28.49]I'm sorry that it's been hard for you lately.
[159:32.28]But thank you so much for being here.
[159:33.82]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[159:37.00]Thanks for your continued support, dude.
[159:39.40]Thank you.
[159:39.70]It means a lot.
[159:43.65]Am I driving to Vegas?
[159:45.45]No.
[159:47.51]No, I'm taking auto onto the plane.
[159:50.97]And he just had his certification.
[159:52.79]The doctor said that he is ready to go.
[159:55.41]He's good.
[159:57.58]And he's going to be a plane dog.
[160:04.00]I'm really nervous about that.
[160:07.70]To a point where I'm considering... I think I'm going to do the crazy thing.
[160:15.75]And you can buy like an extra seat, right?
[160:18.93]That's worth the money to me.
[160:21.16]Buy an extra seat and have it so he has his own little spot, right?
[160:24.96]I gotta call some of these airlines.
[160:30.28]I'm not stuffing that dog under a seat.
[160:32.33]That ain't gonna happen.
[160:37.05]Like not a chance in hell.
[160:38.69]I can't do that.
[160:43.51]Put them on your lap.
[160:44.51]I think they have to be for takeoff and for taxi.
[160:48.37]They have to be on the ground, right?
[160:51.24]But there are some airlines that are like, yeah, just put the dog under the seat for the whole fucking plane ride.
[160:56.46]Oh, by the way, it's a five and a half hour flight.
[161:00.68]I'm not doing that.
[161:02.78]No way.
[161:06.98]They have to be in like a dog crate and they have to be under the seat on some airlines.
[161:15.05]buying first class, I looked into first class.
[161:18.13]First like, most all the airlines that do first class, it's stupid.
[161:26.42]Okay, so first class, some of these tickets are a thousand, like 1200 fucking dollars for first class.
[161:33.17]I'm talking American Airlines, I'm talking United.
[161:35.27]There's like, it's like an 11 hour trip with stops.
[161:41.82]Why would you buy a first class ticket with like a three or four hour layover?
[161:46.43]What the hell?
[161:47.37]What?
[161:49.41]Almost none of them.
[161:50.53]Barely any planes go from Boston to Vegas.
[161:53.95]First class that are nonstop.
[161:58.76]It's just a, oh, this is just a big seat.
[162:00.68]It's just a lazy boy up front for fucking 1200 bucks, 1500 bucks.
[162:06.11]That's why I was a huge JetBlue fan for a while.
[162:08.83]JetBlue got rid of first class and everybody got bigger seats.
[162:15.01]And then now JetBlue has on a lot of their airplanes the mint seats, which I was like, oh, wait, maybe I can do that.
[162:23.40]But they don't allow pets on the mint seats.
[162:27.88]I love JetBlue.
[162:28.82]I've been like a JetBlue fan for a long time.
[162:30.87]But...
[162:34.10]Would love to see the ability to have a pet policy that's not just put dog under seat.
[162:39.98]Yeah, out of all the major airlines, we're talking American, American sucks, like United sucks, right?
[162:49.47]Everybody knows this.
[162:50.45]It's not even a joke anymore.
[162:52.85]Like, they're just bad airlines.
[162:55.17]That's just the way it is.
[162:56.27]JetBlue is not a bad airline yet.
[163:02.31]I have flown on JetBlue dozens of times, and I've never had a bad experience.
[163:09.31]Yet.
[163:10.71]That could change, but I absolutely... It's at this point where I'm like, JetBlue, I'm not flying.
[163:22.05]By the way, my name is Jerma985.
[163:23.43]I run a popular twitch.tv Top 1000 channel, JetBlue.
[163:29.00]What a great airline that is, huh?
[163:35.59]Can my dog sit in a seat?
[163:41.79]The fuck was that?
[163:42.53]I was like, did I just rip a cord out?
[163:52.08]No, okay, that was weird.
[163:54.42]Anyways, I think I pulled my like, I don't know, that was weird.
[164:02.42]Windows is about to restart.
[164:03.74]No, I disabled it permanently.
[164:09.01]But yeah, all jokes aside, though, I've never had a bad experience on JetBlue.
[164:14.49]It's always been a pleasant experience.
[164:19.63]Anywho, let's keep going.
[164:26.19]Thank you to Godly.
[164:29.31]Thank you, Godly967 for the two bucks.
[164:30.99]Welcome back.
[164:31.61]Thank you.
[164:32.45]Thanks for the warm welcome.
[164:35.26]Hall's back.
[164:35.82]Thank you for the $1 Twitch sellout.
[164:39.89]I mean, I'm on the platform.
[164:42.03]Is it really selling out saying that I'm wearing a Twitch shirt and I stream on Twitch?
[164:48.41]I don't have like an Outback Steakhouse shirt on, guys.
[165:00.08]Yes, yeah, yes, yes.
[165:02.96]This is just the only, I'm moving, right?
[165:04.80]That's my excuse for everything.
[165:06.22]If you have something you wanna say to me, I'm moving, right?
[165:10.56]Somebody calls you.
[165:11.40]Hey, man, you were supposed to.
[165:12.72]I'm moving, dude.
[165:14.38]Oh, right.
[165:15.08]Right.
[165:15.26]Okay.
[165:18.79]Your steak came out of the restaurant.
[165:20.25]It was a little cold.
[165:21.63]Uh, excuse me, waiter.
[165:24.31]I'm moving.
[165:25.61]I'm moving across the country in like a week.
[165:28.38]Oh, sir.
[165:29.26]I'm sorry about that.
[165:30.10]We'll take care of that for you.
[165:31.58]You can use it for everything.
[165:38.56]Somebody just wrote, do something.
[165:40.45]Oh, right.
[165:40.83]I probably should write.
[165:42.79]Here, I'll do this.
[165:46.87]Stream's over.
[165:52.03]So actually, let me go like this then.
[165:55.21]They have a point.
[165:55.69]They have a point.
[165:58.82]Let's do this.
[166:10.77]That's not even going to work.
[166:12.95]Why?
[166:17.09]Why is that not going to work?
[166:18.19]There we go.
[166:18.73]Okay.
[166:20.27]There we are.
[166:20.89]So now this is very clear that the stream is over now.
[166:24.20]Right?
[166:24.50]I'm just in the corner hanging out.
[166:32.44]That's better.
[166:33.40]Sorry that you came.
[166:34.12]You thought I was doing something.
[166:35.14]I'm sorry about that.
[166:36.12]Now it's clear.
[166:40.05]Anyways, thank you to... Pocket Pauling for the $1 and I said no, you know, like a liar.
[166:50.14]What does that mean?
[166:52.06]Conant G, thanks for the $1.

[167:27.28]Thank you, Robotica, for the ten bucks.
[167:31.01]Thank you, Robotica.
[167:32.59]That's the least I owe you in the five years you've made me laugh.
[167:38.46]Well, thank you, Robotica.
[167:39.34]You don't owe me anything.
[167:40.51]But I appreciate the $10 nonetheless.
[167:42.29]Thank you.
[167:44.47]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[167:45.73]It's good to have you back, Jerma.
[167:46.85]I hope the trip went well.
[167:50.89]Almost.
[167:52.71]Almost there.
[167:54.51]It's going to be weird being in a new place.
[167:57.09]Because I'm so used to being down here.
[167:58.51]I need to make a new down here.
[168:02.05]Right?
[168:02.31]This is down here.
[168:03.71]I need a new down here.
[168:05.09]I don't know.
[168:05.80]It's going to be weird.
[168:07.74]It's going to smell different, too.
[168:09.06]It's going to smell.
[168:09.74]It's going to be a new smell.
[168:15.29]Everyone needs a new down here.
[168:22.62]Dojo Brother, $50.
[168:24.34]Thank you so much.
[168:25.04]We touched upon it earlier, but thank you again for the $50, dude.
[168:27.32]It means a lot.
[168:29.89]Father Giraldo, Father Giraldo, thank you for the $1.
[168:33.71]Hey, Jeremiah, I'm glad to see you back in the saddle and bringing joy to all of us again.
[168:37.61]Much love also.
[168:38.55]How's life in the capital of fear and loathing?
[168:44.80]Almost.
[168:45.74]Almost there.
[168:48.60]It's great.
[168:49.02]I love Vegas.
[168:50.32]Las Vegas is one of my favorite cities.
[168:52.36]I love it.
[168:55.83]And not just, oh, the Strip.
[168:57.77]Like, just all of Las Vegas.
[168:59.30]There's so much cool shit to see.
[169:00.76]So much interesting things to do.
[169:01.70]It's a great city.
[169:05.08]Just be careful.
[169:07.60]Thank you, though, Father.
[169:09.30]That sounds weird saying it without your... Thank you.
[169:12.03]I'm going to call you Geraldo.
[169:14.23]Thank you, Donor... Donor... I'm going to call you Herbert.
[169:18.07]Thank you, Donor Herbert, for the two bucks.
[169:21.48]Thank you.
[169:22.70]Not a wolf, man.
[169:23.60]Thanks for the three bucks.
[169:24.36]Hey, Jerma, since you said you'll be going to LA on occasion for video stuff, is there any chance you'll do meetups with fans in the LA area?
[169:31.24]I've wanted to meet you since I first started watching your YouTube stuff years ago, but being on the other side of the country made that a bit difficult.
[169:36.88]Also, you said you'd be moving in October 1st.
[169:41.33]My birthday is on the 9th.
[169:42.73]I hereby invite you to party in California.
[169:46.59]There'll be cake.
[169:51.47]I don't know if I could go.
[169:53.58]I don't think I'll be in LA on the 9th.
[169:56.69]But yes, to answer your question.
[170:00.07]The answer is yes.
[170:01.95]I want to be doing shit in LA a lot.
[170:04.33]If I'm going out to LA to shoot something or stream something.
[170:06.92]If I shoot something, I mean stream something.
[170:09.36]We've talked about this before.
[170:11.12]But the purpose of this trip and going to live across the country is specifically to have more resources to do streams that I want to do.
[170:18.53]We talk about the fucking Pac-Man sitting in the restaurant throwing the turkey in the oven.
[170:22.66]we talk about like the stream to be named later, right?
[170:26.59]That you've heard on maybe a podcast.
[170:28.73]There are tons of fucking things that I want to do that I, if I'm there doing them and streaming them, then of course I would love to do like a meetup or something.
[170:35.61]Absolutely.
[170:45.42]But I mean, personal invite to your birthday party here, just like put me on a big screen.
[170:51.58]You know what I mean?
[170:53.61]Ready?
[170:53.97]Like, I'm gonna give you some reactions that you can put up, like, on, like, a projector.
[171:08.62]Hey, dude, what's up, man?
[171:10.69]You still in school?
[171:12.55]Nice, nice, nice.
[171:15.03]Hey, you know, is the bar open back here?
[171:19.95]Yeah, I don't know.
[171:29.61]Is he alright?
[171:32.15]He's crazy.
[171:32.77]I love this guy.
[171:33.83]He's crazy.
[171:34.63]You know what I mean?
[171:35.09]He's fucking crazy.
[171:41.91]This is a nice house.
[171:45.70]When was it built?
[171:46.44]95.
[171:48.90]That's pretty good.
[171:51.06]Is this Central Air?
[172:04.53]I'm going to go.
[172:05.15]I'm going to go.
[172:07.19]This was cool.
[172:10.65]Thanks, man.
[172:12.99]I want a cake, a fucking cake.
[172:14.45]Alright, hold on.
[172:17.19]Here it comes.
[172:20.67]Happy birthday to you.
[172:23.39]Happy birthday to you.
[172:28.30]Happy birthday, dear Evan.
[172:35.62]Happy birthday to you.
[172:41.91]Alright, make a wish, man.
[172:43.15]Make a wish.
[172:46.13]There you are.
[172:46.93]Nice.
[172:51.80]I'm out of here, though, man.
[172:53.40]Happy birthday, dude.
[172:54.82]Thanks for the invite.
[172:57.76]Yeah, I'm out.
[173:02.32]Is that cool?
[173:02.84]Is that enough time?
[173:04.23]See you later, man.
[173:04.89]Happy birthday again.
[173:06.56]Beautiful house.
[173:36.26]Hey, what's up?
[173:39.38]My left drive is lost.
[173:41.30]Is that A Street back here?
[173:44.80]I just don't know where I am, but I just... A Street's this one, right?
[173:50.31]So if I go this way around the corner, then he can come down on D, right?
[173:55.59]Okay.
[173:57.21]Yeah, happy birthday!
[173:59.99]I don't know, this is trash.
[174:01.61]Do you guys trash?
[174:03.03]I didn't finish it though, I'm sorry.
[174:06.39]Okay.
[174:08.79]Happy birthday, man.
[174:09.41]Got it.
[174:15.65]There you go.
[174:24.27]What the fuck am I watching?
[174:28.65]Antisocial, awkward.
[174:29.97]That's just, you know, that's what you do.
[174:35.34]Fringe compilation.
[174:42.10]I can't, by the way, I can't wait to do the fucking green screen.
[174:45.60]That's gonna be, I can't, we're gonna do that, I'm gonna just get shitfaced and we're gonna do that all night.
[174:51.15]I am going to, we're gonna put a huge just green backdrop and I'm going to do like 30 separate scenarios.
[175:00.89]That's one of my most anticipated streams of like the year.
[175:03.37]I can't wait.
[175:03.91]It's gonna be so much fun.
[175:06.93]Take a picture of this.
[175:08.05]Okay, get a screenshot of this.
[175:09.45]Because somebody's going to want it for like a green screen purposes.
[175:13.85]No, you already had it.
[175:15.09]I left the room like five seconds ago.
[175:16.29]Screenshot that.
[175:19.67]Imaginary friends.
[175:23.95]Alright.
[175:26.41]But hey, happy birthday, Mr. Wolfman.
[175:28.41]Not a wolfman, sorry.
[175:29.31]Let me get that right.

[177:33.90]Thank you.
[177:35.25]Potato, thank you.
[177:37.29]For your four dollars.

[177:53.48]Ivory, thanks for the one dollar.
[177:55.71]It's hard to believe I've been subscribed to you for over a year.
[177:58.79]Until you leave.
[178:00.13]Suddenly the weeks feel longer and duller without your hilarious hummer.
[178:04.69]I'm glad to hear you've returned safely and wish you luck at Twin Peaks Hospital.
[178:12.34]Thank you.
[178:14.18]Thank you, Cosmic Moses for the $1.
[178:15.98]Welcome back, my boy.
[178:16.90]I've been in bed since Thursday with strep.
[178:19.82]But tonight won't be a bad... Won't be as bad with a Jerma string.
[178:26.81]Thank you.
[178:28.21]It means a lot.
[178:29.57]Hope you feel better.
[178:31.95]Opt465, thanks for the $1.
[178:33.35]Snus, thanks for the $4.
[178:35.68]Interzellz, thanks for the $4 as well.
[178:40.82]YoKarps, thanks for the $2.
[178:42.52]Save us, Jeremy, from the hospital food.
[178:44.68]Oh, I said it was you guys, right?
[178:48.94]That's true.
[178:51.34]Sorry about that food.
[178:53.18]Hey, Eves, thanks for the $5.
[178:55.28]Twitch wasn't letting me send the message, so I just screenshotted it.
[178:59.14]Let's see.
[179:03.28]Uh, hey Jerma, hope you're doing alright.
[179:04.42]I have two things to say.
[179:05.26]In a bit of a shit situation the past week, and finding it a bit hard to find people to hang out with at my new college, one of the guys that packs with me is actually living in Spain now, but I was wondering if you have advice to talking to people I'm not shy, just sometimes can't be bothered.
[179:21.37]Also wanted to say, I don't know if you play games off-stream, but I highly recommend Dragon Quest XI.
[179:26.41]It's a great fucking game.
[179:27.49]It's a childhood favorite of mine, but wouldn't recommend streaming it.
[179:34.21]One of my friends in college, you mentioned college, actually played all the Dragon Quest games, which leads me to my point.
[179:48.85]Remember we talked about this before?
[179:50.33]A lot of people are in the same situation that you're in, right?
[179:56.84]Everybody's new.
[179:57.72]Everybody's trying to find somebody to talk to.
[179:59.24]Everybody's trying to find the group that they belong to, right?
[180:02.71]just being able to know that somebody likes the same things that you do.
[180:07.82]There's somebody at that college that probably thinks Dragon Quest is fucking awesome.
[180:15.21]You know what I mean?
[180:16.25]They're there somewhere.
[180:18.05]They're there somewhere.
[180:19.67]When I was in college, it was the same thing.
[180:24.71]It was, you just kind of got thrown into this new environment and you don't know, whoa, who the fuck are these people?
[180:30.75]I didn't go to high school with this guy.
[180:32.09]And then you just, you end up talking to them.
[180:34.75]And my first college roommate, my first one ever, we didn't have a lot in common.
[180:40.35]We just kind of went to and from the building and the roommate.
[180:45.21]Hey, what's up, man?
[180:45.75]Like, you know, it wasn't like a scenario where I didn't become like good friends with that person.
[180:51.38]But...
[180:52.64]After like a year of college, you're in these classes, you're in the same major as some of these people, you start to just be around them.
[180:59.51]You'll get put into group projects that, oh, blah, blah, blah, what he just said brought up something else, and then I just figured out that you and I like the same thing.
[181:08.15]It just happens.
[181:12.95]Recently found my college has a smash community.
[181:16.57]Exactly, right?
[181:20.23]Exactly.
[181:22.86]You just have to, it's just, you'll see a flyer for like, oh, uh, the local, uh, XYZ university art club.
[181:32.59]And it's like, what time is that happening?
[181:35.61]Like eight o'clock on Sunday.
[181:39.37]I'm, I'm just going to go.
[181:40.55]I'm going to go to that because I I'm going to, you'll find it just takes time.
[181:49.27]After three years of college, I found out they had an arcade.
[181:54.59]Yeah.
[181:57.01]You just got to look for it.
[182:00.23]Are we hanging out or what is this?
[182:01.71]Yeah, man.
[182:05.22]The Smash Club on campus was probably the worst club I went to.
[182:09.84]But was there somebody there that you also did one of these, right?
[182:13.54]Let's say it was stupid and you didn't like it.
[182:15.38]There was a guy here that kind of had the same face as you, like...
[182:20.94]And you walk over, you're like, is this for real?
[182:24.88]I mean, items?
[182:26.44]Items in a tournament?
[182:28.38]And he's just like, yeah, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[182:30.64]No Final Destination.
[182:31.58]They're playing on Yoshi's Island with fucking Smash Balls.
[182:34.00]And it's like, whip out the number.
[182:37.00]Here it is, man.
[182:37.82]Here's my card.
[182:38.67]Give me a call.
[182:41.93]You'll find it.
[182:42.33]It just takes a little bit of time.
[182:44.35]It took me a couple years before I had a couple of college friends.
[182:53.86]Yeah, you'll find it.
[182:56.16]But Dragon Quest is a interesting franchise.
[183:00.06]I've never played it myself, but I've seen people play it.
[183:03.62]No, you're not going to have them.
[183:04.96]The card thing was just a soliloquy.
[183:15.89]Thank you.
[183:16.19]That's correct.
[183:17.77]It was a soliloquy.
[183:24.80]The point still stands, though.
[183:26.53]It's got to find somebody that also thinks the same things that you think are cool are also cool, and then you'll just connect.
[183:31.75]You might not be best friends with that person, but it'll open up more opportunity to obviously make more friends.
[183:38.85]That's how I did it.
[183:44.64]That's a big boy word.
[183:45.76]Watch out.
[183:47.62]I wish you the best of luck, though.
[183:48.56]Thank you.
[183:52.68]Where are we here?
[183:55.52]Thank you.
[183:55.86]Radioactive Rooster for the $4.22.
[183:58.03]Joined late.
[183:58.55]Hope the move is going smoothly.
[184:01.13]It's going well.
[184:01.83]Thank you so much, Radioactive.
[184:04.53]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[184:06.09]Oh, this is for Otto, Jerma.
[184:09.03]I'll get him a nice treat.
[184:10.37]I'll get a good treat for it.
[184:11.27]Thank you.
[184:12.16]Oh, fucking goddammit.
[184:13.38]The guy that came in here and said, what are you doing?
[184:14.90]Like, I'm sorry.
[184:16.32]Somebody else just came in here and saw a guy reading fucking bits.
[184:19.94]The stream's over.
[184:21.48]It's over.
[184:21.80]I was up there for a long time.
[184:27.12]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[184:28.34]Thank you, Divusp, for the two bucks.
[184:31.28]Claire, thanks for the one dollar.
[184:32.56]Hey, Jerma, just started baking classes last week.
[184:35.38]Everything was going great on the tour of the kitchen until the professor... You know what they did.
[184:41.37]They fell into something.
[184:44.09]And they walked into it somehow.
[184:45.59]Thank you, Claire.
[184:46.59]Thank you, SmellMyMouth.
[184:50.57]I don't think I will, but thanks for the $4.
[184:53.77]I watched a whole episode of Jack Ryan for this.
[185:00.17]I don't know what that is.
[185:02.57]But thanks for the bits.
[185:06.34]Thanks for the $4.
[185:08.92]Atrolux, Atrux, thanks for the $1.
[185:10.52]When was the last time you played Enter the Gungeon?
[185:13.22]Did you ever beat it?
[185:13.96]Love your germs.
[185:14.48]Glad you're okay.
[185:15.58]Hope Vegas went well.
[185:19.92]I think...
[185:23.48]I think, uh... I think... Did I stream Enter the Gungeon?
[185:31.09]I don't remember.
[185:32.19]I think I played it, but then it wasn't... I liked Isaac a lot more.
[185:35.15]I couldn't play it like I played Isaac.
[185:37.65]I did, didn't I?
[185:38.35]Hmm.
[185:42.67]I don't think I got past, like, the first floor.
[185:45.35]I've beaten Mega Satan, like, 20 times.
[185:48.70]But I couldn't even get down to floor 2 in Enter the Gungeon.
[185:56.11]Yeah, there was a video on it.
[186:01.86]Strafe.
[186:04.00]I just watched you beat Mega Satan today.
[186:12.19]Please don't play Gungeon.
[186:14.29]Somebody said they didn't like it.
[186:16.35]It looks fun.
[186:21.78]I don't think I'll play it, though.
[186:24.14]It's too much for my brain to have to handle.
[186:27.47]But I've seen people play it.
[186:28.87]It looks really interesting.
[186:30.21]And I played it once and I went, I'll try it again.
[186:32.42]Maybe I'll look into it.
[186:34.08]And it never happened.
[186:35.26]But thank you, Atchalux.
[186:37.92]Thank you to Tiny Goat Jeff for the $1.
[186:41.76]It is Parv's birthday today.
[186:45.31]Say happy birthday to whoever's birthday it is.
[186:48.27]Happy birthday.
[186:50.29]Thank you, Tiny Goat, for the $1.
[186:56.02]sly 161 thanks for the one dollar actually can you stream this game for a few days just to annoy chat because it's actually a really fun game I mean I can't I don't want to just deliberately try to anger people
[187:19.18]Maybe I'll start every single stream for the next week with that.
[187:22.38]But no, but that's like how I'll be like, hey, that's an interesting stream I'm going to do today.
[187:26.72]But hey, please don't watch all of you people that didn't want to watch this and now they left.
[187:32.27]You do that all the time though.
[187:38.17]Didn't you stop the stream three hours ago?
[187:40.01]No.
[187:41.82]We just went, we did something else.
[187:43.78]We just did IRL's home stream for like two or three hours.
[187:48.85]Jerma is so fucking old.
[187:51.70]Well, thank you for your input.
[187:52.94]468301154551436985558.
[187:53.08]Please, please, like... Where did you get that name?
[187:54.84]Holy shit, that name is long.
[188:09.19]That's the kind of name.
[188:10.43]That's like the, that, that honestly is like, that's a fucking hilarious name.
[188:14.55]Because to me, that is, this is just like, it is a throwaway.
[188:18.48]Like, fire it, 9-5-9-5-5.
[188:19.94]Tell us, tell us the truth.
[188:23.46]Tell us the truth.
[188:24.06]Is that your actual account name?
[188:26.00]Or did you, is that like account number 40?
[188:27.80]I just want the truth.
[188:38.39]Wait, why'd you ban him?
[188:43.18]What did he do?
[188:43.64]Don't ban him.
[188:49.78]Oh, I didn't.
[188:50.40]Oh, okay.
[188:51.34]I was like, he didn't do anything.
[188:52.80]He didn't do anything.
[189:01.88]I got jubated.
[189:08.03]It pops up 66% of the way through the streams.
[189:11.81]Yeah, that sounds about right.
[189:19.19]It's the amount of ants I can fit in my mouth.
[189:21.97]I like that name.
[189:24.13]That's a good name.
[189:25.59]I'm not even kidding.
[189:30.98]But anyways, thank you to Anonymous for the $1.
[189:34.98]Congrats on finally doing a sponsored stream.
[189:37.99]Were there a bunch of people doing sponsored streams for this game?
[189:43.69]Did I, like, put myself right in the middle of, like, everyone doing sponsored videos and sponsored streams?
[189:49.34]That's not correct.
[189:50.56]Is it?
[189:54.14]Kind of.
[189:55.72]And I'm wearing a Twitch hoodie, too.
[189:57.03]That's just, like, this is... How much more, like, typical can I be?
[190:01.37]Like, hey, sponsored stream!
[190:05.15]Make sure the advertisers see that, like I'm a Twitch guy.
[190:08.14]I need a DXRacer.
[190:17.04]No, I don't think I want an airplane chair.
[190:22.14]Just be real, right?
[190:26.75]You know when your seat's in the upright position of an airplane and you're like, holy shit, this sucks.
[190:34.35]Why do I want to sit in that when I play a game where I sit at my desk?
[190:40.83]He also sold out the jet.
[190:42.17]The JetBlue seats are more comfortable than a DXRacer.
[190:49.50]That's true.
[190:50.78]I've sat in both.
[190:54.24]Man, JetBlue, let me tell you, by the way, JetBlue got the most leg room in Coach.
[190:57.30]You know that?
[190:59.03]You can stretch your legs out.
[191:02.15]You can go like this.
[191:04.48]Oh, the seats are so comfortable.
[191:10.64]It's true.
[191:11.00]Look that up.
[191:11.48]I'm not kidding.
[191:11.98]That's a real thing.
[191:15.10]I'm not sponsored by JetBlue.
[191:16.82]They're just good.
[191:19.74]Like, you can quote that.
[191:23.30]I'm not sponsored by X. They're just good.
[191:26.10]That's it.
[191:34.52]How much would you sell your chair for?
[191:36.08]This one?
[191:37.62]I'm not selling my fucking chair to one of you guys.
[191:41.02]I don't know what the fuck you'll do with this.
[191:46.19]Where's the best place to get an iced coffee?
[191:48.75]Well, I happen to think that the JetBlue cart service has a fresh brewed coffee system in the back.
[191:59.03]I would put it up there with some of the best I've ever had.
[192:06.21]That's just my opinion.
[192:07.01]Nobody told me to say that.
[192:09.46]Give the chair.
[192:10.10]You don't want this.
[192:10.78]This thing's going into like a garbage disposal.
[192:13.78]I'm going to recycle this chair.
[192:16.57]What's the best burger place?
[192:19.85]I mean, there's obviously the easy choices.
[192:21.79]There's, you know...
[192:24.01]like In-N-Out Burger, McDonald's, Burger King.
[192:27.51]But the JetBlue Eat-Up Boxes, you don't really even need a burger after you have one of these.
[192:31.82]They're only like $7.
[192:33.40]They've got every kind of protein, every kind of cheese, crackers.
[192:36.07]They fill you up.
[192:36.73]It's a fill-up eat-up box, and you won't even need to have a burger after that.
[192:55.48]Okay, I've had the chicken sandwich from JetBlue before.
[192:59.02]The, like, chicken, chipotle chicken sandwich, whatever it is.
[193:03.34]It's good.
[193:06.36]You don't need to go to Burger King anymore.
[193:08.48]You've got a JetBlue chicken sandwich.
[193:18.51]I refuse to believe you.
[193:19.49]Have you flown JetBlue before?
[193:23.17]How can you be so certain?
[193:26.52]If you've never... Just buy a fucking plane ticket.
[193:29.14]Just buy a plane ticket already.
[193:32.54]By the way, October 1st.
[193:34.68]I'm looking for my dog to go out there.
[193:36.84]It's a lot of money, as you know.
[193:40.84]Hydrate.
[193:46.26]You don't have to pay me to tell you that.
[193:48.46]I'm not going to say it again.
[193:51.88]But like, oh yeah, this guy's desperately trying to get a plane ticket for free.
[194:00.81]It's not the case.
[194:04.97]I am available to chat.
[194:07.25]JetBlue is around.
[194:09.55]Anybody's dad work?
[194:10.39]Anybody's dad a JetBlue doctor?
[194:12.95]Somebody in the chat has to know somebody that like at JetBlue.
[194:15.42]Like your dad is a pilot or your mother's a pilot for JetBlue.
[194:18.24]I have a couple questions for you.
[194:22.52]Well, I gotta go.
[194:24.10]Look, it's been so long since I've been able to sit here and talk and communicate with everybody.
[194:28.78]This has taken a lot longer than anticipated.
[194:32.59]My dad works for Nintendo.
[194:33.79]He doesn't work for JetBlue.
[194:42.90]If JetBlue sends you a new chair, I would love that.
[194:47.70]I would love a blue and orange chair.
[194:51.14]That's a jet blue right here, and it was a fucking airplane seat.
[194:55.65]You're telling me that wouldn't be awesome?
[194:57.19]Why would you not want one of those?
[195:01.01]I would love one of those.
[195:08.89]That sounds sick, right?
[195:10.33]That's fucking cool.
[195:14.74]Weren't you just complaining about how you hated airplane seats?
[195:18.58]I didn't complain about JetBlue's seats.
[195:20.48]I have said nothing but amazing things about an incredible company that deserves way more praise because of their outstanding, outstanding customer satisfaction.
[195:37.88]I uploaded my first YouTube video.
[195:41.16]Okay, let's not get carried away.
[195:43.28]Alright, let's go.
[195:44.00]Let's go.
[195:44.72]You're right.
[195:50.83]JetBlue is a reptilian lie.
[195:52.76]Hey.
[195:56.74]You got your scaly friend?
[195:57.84]You got your reptilian friend?
[195:59.02]You can bring them on JetBlue.
[196:00.10]JetBlue pause program.
[196:02.11]You want to pack them up?
[196:02.93]They take great, great, great care of those little monsters.
[196:07.07]Whatever they are.
[196:08.05]Little iguanas.
[196:13.68]Where are we here?
[196:18.80]Hey, Ancient Sasquatch, thanks for the $1.
[196:20.52]Thank you for the stream, Jerma.

[196:29.15]Thank you, Ancient Sasquatch.
[196:32.27]Thank you, Razzle, for the $1.

[197:16.61]My girlfriend and I just moved to a new city and it was a little rough.
[197:18.95]Here's hoping your move goes smoother.
[197:21.25]Thanks for all the laughs.
[197:24.03]Yeah, I'm thinking it's going to be a little bumpy.
[197:25.91]The road will be bumpy.
[197:28.03]But I have to do it.
[197:31.21]Something I want to do.
[197:32.13]Bad.
[197:33.03]But thank you for the $10 and thank you for the encouraging words.
[197:37.43]Not really encouraging words, but advice.
[197:43.26]Thank you.
[197:45.24]you're flying I am flying can you guess what airline I'll give you a hint starts with a j and ends with a g-e-t-b-l-u-n-e hey garfield the Monday killer thanks for the one dollar welcome back to my old friend check me out looking pretty swanky in my new lasagna red
[198:15.25]That means you read over 200 Garfagraphs.
[198:20.27]I've read over 200 Garfield messages.
[198:22.58]I almost just drew this on my face.
[198:24.34]Put it down.
[198:24.82]Uh, thank you for that.
[198:29.16]What a long road we've headed down together, Jerma.
[198:31.36]I can't believe the relationship we've built over the past few months, Jerma.
[198:34.30]It feels like a lifetime, and it hasn't even been a year.
[198:37.33]Let's reflect on the past, but look to the future of Garfagraphs.
[198:41.71]Truly, this is just the beginning of something Garftastic.
[198:55.58]At least you can... I just heard Kim sneeze upstairs and it threw me off.
[199:01.18]I heard like... Is it JetBlue Command?
[199:05.45]Good.
[199:07.97]Thank you, Garfield, though.
[199:09.85]Here's to another 60 years.
[199:13.89]Except you definitely aren't going to live that long.
[199:17.63]You're a fat, unhealthy cat.
[199:22.87]So...
[199:26.05]I'm sorry.
[199:32.36]Bro, what the fuck?
[199:33.30]What?
[199:33.64]What?
[199:34.60]What?
[199:37.38]Says the guy living to 73.
[199:38.39]Yeah, Garfield's not gonna be, not gonna live to 73.
[199:50.56]I belong in, like, the fucking, like... What, like, fucking cartoon do I belong in?
[199:55.80]I look like I just went on a show and got a makeover and I'm supposed to look better.
[200:11.02]No, I don't.
[200:13.86]Ren and Stimpy.
[200:15.32]Hey, thank you Smiter for the $1.
[200:17.42]I've been watching you for years.
[200:18.42]One of my introduction videos of you is the Stand Tall for Turtle Fall video.
[200:22.51]After that, they're hooked.
[200:27.21]That wasn't... That was Titanfall.
[200:29.19]I remember that game.
[200:35.73]Hold on, somebody made a JetBlue command.
[200:38.43]Known for their excellent customer service, friendly flight staff, and comfortable seating, with top-of-the-line legroom, JetBlue is the ideal choice for any flight, domestic or international, and is formally endorsed by DERBA 985.
[200:52.56]Yes.
[200:54.36]Yes, they are.
[200:57.76]Like, I will formally endorse JetBlue.
[201:04.25]I kind of just did.
[201:06.24]We did it.
[201:07.28]We did it.
[201:13.07]Free snacks, man.
[201:15.23]Let's talk about this for one second because this is really fucking important.
[201:18.78]Listen to me.
[201:20.62]You think it's a joke, this whole JetBlue thing.
[201:24.08]I solidified my mindset of this is the best fucking airline.
[201:30.69]You want to know what it was?
[201:31.98]It wasn't the legroom.
[201:33.26]It wasn't the seats.
[201:34.72]It wasn't the immaculate customer satisfaction and flight staff.
[201:39.88]On a lot of JetBlue flights, you can just walk up to the fucking snack bar and take whatever you want.
[201:52.33]You can just walk the fuck up.
[201:53.91]There's a giant fridge with a bunch of stuff in it.
[201:56.11]You can take anything you want.
[201:59.39]And it's encouraged.
[202:00.41]They say, hey, the snack area is open.
[202:02.87]Go take whatever the fuck you want.
[202:08.63]They got Cheez-Its.
[202:09.43]They got Doritos.
[202:10.67]Anything.
[202:10.97]Like, oh, I need a snack for the plane.
[202:12.39]I need water.
[202:13.39]They got juices.
[202:14.17]I'm telling you, it was amazing.
[202:19.12]They actually say over the intercom, yes, sir.
[202:22.88]If you go to the middle of the plane, you can help yourself and grab whatever you want.
[202:26.50]And I'm like...
[202:31.01]That's impossible!
[202:35.07]It's only on certain planes, though.
[202:36.23]Not every single plane.
[202:37.45]It's like more than half of them.
[202:45.42]I've been stealing.
[202:46.82]No, I haven't.
[202:50.06]I made five JetBlueTV ads in this one stream.
[202:56.79]Wait, I'm not stealing.
[202:57.79]They said I could do it.
[203:03.58]I've told you guys this before.
[203:05.80]If I like something, you're going to know.
[203:07.68]And if I'm not going to pretend to like something, I'm going to tell you about things that I actually, actually fucking love.
[203:17.41]Now watch it come out like tomorrow that JetBlue was skimming profits off of all their customers and they were like a terrible company.
[203:25.29]That would, I can't endorse that.
[203:30.44]But that's why I said yet before.
[203:36.34]Selling out for free snacks.
[203:43.06]For free.
[203:46.50]Someone edited a JetBlue ad.
[203:48.58]No, wait till the green screen.
[203:56.30]Taking advantage of small flight business and stealing snacks.
[204:02.08]And they give you a hot towel on JetBlue.
[204:06.00]You ever had a hot towel experience before?
[204:07.78]Or you have like a four or five hour flight, you wake up and you're groggy.
[204:11.02]Flight attendants going down the aisle with a fucking box of hot towels.
[204:16.90]And they hand them to every single person.
[204:19.24]You get to, oh, it's nice.
[204:20.65]It's hot on your face.
[204:21.97]I want to go on a plane right now if it was JetBlue.
[204:31.47]Every airline does that.
[204:32.59]Not as good as the other, not as good as the one I'm talking about.
[204:39.08]That's not first class.
[204:45.84]Do you own a JetBlue?
[204:48.94]No, I don't.
[204:50.10]Just a happy customer.
[204:57.65]Alright, we gotta go.
[204:58.43]We gotta go.
[204:58.91]We gotta go.
[204:59.27]We gotta go.
[204:59.71]We gotta go.
[205:00.19]We gotta go.
[205:02.32]Thank you, Sly, for the $1.
[205:03.72]Kim is going to murder you.
[205:05.01]Do you know how expensive lipstick is?
[205:07.99]I got express written... I got express permission to use that from Kim.
[205:13.38]So... We're good.
[205:15.82]I already asked.
[205:18.38]Maritical, thanks for the $1.
[205:20.84]Italcrab, italwar, italrat.
[205:23.92]No, that's my emote.
[205:24.76]jermaRat.
[205:25.86]It's a battle, the emotes.
[205:27.66]Thank you.
[205:28.53]Thank you, Milkshake, for the $1.
[205:30.19]Jerma out here with that squillium tentacles haircut.
[205:35.29]Thank you, Rajasil, for the $1.
[205:36.81]Do you think Kim is going to notice that her lipstick tastes like whiteboard?
[205:41.42]She's not, because there's no more left.
[205:47.11]Fucking Squilliam.
[205:48.33]God damn it.
[205:58.50]Thank you, Penny Kettle for the $1.
[206:00.94]There was a Reddit thread titled, what's something your SO does that you used to find cute when you were dating, but now irritates and infuriates you?
[206:11.57]And I'm going to guess Kim would say he steals my lipstick to draw with, steals my scarf to keep paint from getting in his hair, and I have to clean up every time he goes for the smash the thing joke.
[206:24.23]I clean up my own mess.
[206:26.53]I'm going to clean that up.
[206:27.61]I'm going to clean that up.
[206:28.49]I clean it up.
[206:30.01]I'm a cleaner.
[206:31.45]I clean things.
[206:34.33]Steals her bag, too.
[206:35.29]I didn't steal anybody's bag.
[206:39.23]I didn't steal anything.
[206:42.87]He pours milk in her purses.
[206:44.11]No.
[206:44.79]No.
[206:46.09]No.
[206:49.29]And her wallet.
[206:49.91]That didn't happen.
[206:51.83]Don't say that.
[206:56.30]Okay.
[206:57.80]Alright, we gotta go.
[206:58.48]We gotta go.
[206:58.94]We gotta go.
[207:00.48]Smelly boy, thanks for the one dollar.
[207:04.66]If you died and they found that whiteboard in your room...
[207:08.76]They'd think it was some kind of cult calling you a cult calling card This is very clearly we were playing hangman Thank you smelly boy, thank you butter derp for the two dollars seventy nine cents Hey Jerma, I'm back just like you are and I started college this week.
[207:26.90]Yay me Glad you're back temporarily and I hope you enjoyed my last message.
[207:31.13]Anyway, what's your favorite stream you've done so far and what's your least favorite?
[207:36.67]uh
[207:38.99]That's tough.
[207:42.05]I don't have a favorite stream.

[212:50.31]I'm building a computer, and I've just been informed that my RAM delivery is going to be delayed for a fucking week.
[212:56.38]So could you scream something mean about Newegg to make me feel better?
[213:01.06]Thanks, and good luck with the move.
[213:04.64]I'm not going to tear down and say something mean about a company.
[213:09.40]I will say something very nice, though, about JetBlue.
[213:12.40]I think that JetBlue seriously had... Hey, forget about Newegg.
[213:17.48]There you go.
[213:19.88]Do people still use Newegg?
[213:21.08]Can't you get everything on Amazon?
[213:24.38]Is Amazon cheaper or is Newegg still cheap?
[213:26.98]I haven't used Newegg in a long time.
[213:28.72]But bad you having a bad experience.
[213:30.96]It's sorry you're having a bad experience with them.
[213:36.22]It's not hard to say anything bad about New Egg.
[213:40.09]But it's real easy to say something very nice.
[213:45.65]About... You know who.
[213:51.73]You know who.

[214:19.31]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $4.
[214:20.89]Glad to see you back, man.
[214:21.73]Never stop being completely insane.
[214:24.33]Completely insane.
[214:26.00]You funny, handsome man.
[214:28.02]Also, Star exposed you live on stream.
[214:32.88]What am I making these claims?
[214:35.53]Irma's being weird on his stream, so I came here.
[214:38.09]Dude, that guy pre-records all his streams.
[214:44.24]Just so he can be edgy and different.
[214:46.68]Ignore him.
[214:48.51]Irma's being weird.
[215:06.89]How's that Zarya gameplay going?
[215:18.88]You gonna do anything else?
[215:30.38]Yeah!
[215:30.74]That's how we get back!

[215:32.94]That's how we go!
[215:42.02]flame come out.
[215:43.92]Energy plasma.
[215:48.29]I don't get that.
[215:48.81]There's no reference.
[215:50.69]He's just fucking around.
[215:51.47]He's just having fun.
[215:54.39]And it's important.
[215:55.09]How do I pre-record my streams?
[215:56.83]If I can see WooUp and Smoke in the chat.
[215:59.03]If I can see someone edit that.
[216:00.32]See?
[216:00.90]We are not pre-recorded.
[216:02.92]I'm here.
[216:07.14]I can only go so far though.
[216:09.88]See?
[216:09.96]See?
[216:12.42]I can't go this far, I'm attached.
[216:15.06]My leash only goes this far.
[216:23.71]Okay, I don't feel safe, I have to come back.
[216:32.23]Star's a great guy, hope he's having a good time.
[216:34.79]I came here.
[216:35.29]Dude, that guy pre-records all his streams.
[216:41.03]Dude, that guy pre-records all his streams.
[216:42.55]That guy pre-records all his streams.
[216:44.95]I can't let it go!
[216:45.71]Yeah, I'm connected to a computer, yeah.
[217:15.79]I'm just sitting here seething.
[217:18.03]No, actually, I hope... Did he get moved in?
[217:24.17]Is he all, like, moved in?
[217:25.13]I know he was having, like, a lot of problems.
[217:29.74]That's good.
[217:31.26]I hope he moved in.
[217:32.92]I knew that was, like, the moving truck was fucking with him.
[217:35.74]Not encouraging to hear that kind of shit.
[217:40.26]But... I hope he's doing alright.
[217:42.18]I hope he likes it wherever he is.
[217:45.37]Need to go to the water park with him again.
[217:51.31]But, yeah.
[217:52.06]Anyways, let's keep going here.
[217:54.72]Uh, where are we?
[217:55.26]Right here?
[217:55.66]Uh, where are we?

[218:29.63]It's like deleted.
[218:30.55]Okay, there we are.
[218:31.73]Because I'm trying to find where that clip was.
[218:43.89]I'm confused.
[218:54.59]There we go.
[218:55.07]Okay, found it.
[218:55.67]This took me a little bit of zoning in.
[218:59.19]Thank you, Motion Monroe, for the $4.
[219:01.97]There's a hamster on your chest.
[219:03.85]Ew.

[219:07.60]Burt Reynolds and Mac Miller.
[219:11.36]I did hear about that.
[219:16.60]I did hear about that.
[219:24.29]Unfortunate.
[219:26.95]Yeah, if you didn't know, that happened.
[219:32.71]But, just remember what they did.
[219:39.43]Where were we here?
[219:46.75]Thank you, Casey, for bringing that to attention, people that may not have known.
[219:50.47]Div, USP, thanks for the $4.
[219:51.87]I love when you do weird creative shit like this.

[219:58.24]Sometimes we try.
[220:00.86]Drossophilia, thanks for the $1.
[220:02.16]As angry as I am at chat for not letting you play a game you wanted to, I'm so happy it turned into that insanity.
[220:06.92]You always want to make everyone happy.
[220:09.05]And that's what makes you amazing.
[220:12.31]I just don't want to annoy people.
[220:14.43]Or I want people to want to watch the streams I'm doing.
[220:17.31]I don't want it to be like, yeah, well, I mean...
[220:21.12]Bye.
[220:21.73]I'd rather try to do something everyone can enjoy.
[220:25.37]Sometimes, though, I am just going to do what I feel like doing.
[220:28.11]That's going to happen.
[220:30.53]That's happened at least a few times.
[220:33.42]But... It's all good.
[220:44.65]He said he left hours ago.
[220:50.17]Night team.
[220:50.61]Thank you for the four one ten dollars here night team That was the weirdest 35 minutes I've ever seen and I loved every single second of it Thank you night team for the ten bucks.

[221:40.67]Thanks for everything and best wishes to Kim.
[221:42.79]Thank you.
[221:46.01]I don't see myself going to Europe or going to another continent for a long time.
[221:52.93]I'm literally spending a large amount of money to go somewhere right now.
[221:58.80]So I probably... No, that's not going to happen.
[222:03.23]That's not... The people in chat, don't listen to the people in chat right now.
[222:06.05]They're being a little funny.
[222:10.91]But... I've always wanted to go to like Gamescom or Dreamhack or something.
[222:18.79]And then if I'm there, then do the other... Do the whole thing, right?
[222:24.36]But probably not for a long time, if I could ever do it.
[222:28.20]But I really appreciate that.
[222:29.26]Thank you, Jerma Lover.
[222:32.15]Appreciate it.
[222:34.95]Spectac, thanks for the $1.
[222:36.63]I think you should wear your glasses more, as I'm one with awful sight myself.
[222:41.27]I know the value of seeing everything clear, unless you somehow got cured on stream, which I highly doubt.
[222:46.77]I did.
[222:47.03]This looks blurry to me.
[222:49.23]This looks worse.
[222:51.45]This looks bad to me.
[222:54.53]Uh, Red Riolu, thanks for the $4.
[222:58.11]Hi, Jeremy1985, just wanted to say how much I appreciate all of your streams.
[223:03.37]I'm going to throw up if I keep these on and read.
[223:06.21]Uh, been pretty demoralized for the past five or so months after getting rejected, ignored from every job I've applied to, especially since my artwork is the focus.
[223:14.30]Your content has consistently made me feel better, and I'm so glad that I have five plus years worth of your content to binge.
[223:20.73]Jeremy Hart.
[223:22.09]Also, would you consider doing a scare Saturday kind of thing during October?
[223:25.53]There's a certain someone that's going to come back in October.
[223:30.59]Like, he's already been hired.
[223:35.07]Yeah, he's a weird fucking guy.
[223:36.65]But he's coming back.
[223:45.48]No, he's already been on camera.
[223:46.62]You've already seen him.
[223:47.36]I hired him.
[223:47.84]He was alright.
[223:52.25]But thank you, Red.
[223:53.63]Thank you.
[223:54.01]It's weenie for the three bucks.
[223:55.45]Jerma 1v1 me as Pac-Man when Ultimate comes out.
[224:00.51]I'm going to play like four games of that and probably never turn it on ever again because I'll get angry at my terrible game playing and I'll get upset and I don't want to lose.
[224:08.31]And then I'll come back to it like a year later and play it for like three weeks.
[224:11.75]And then probably... I don't know.
[224:15.01]So I win.
[224:15.55]You already won.
[224:16.21]Yeah, I forfeit.

[225:16.86]Toomindiv, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[225:18.28]Jeremiah, I was joking about the last bit about Hercule.
[225:20.76]You look like him with your hair mustache.
[225:23.12]Also, thank you for the years of entertainment.
[225:24.42]What you do means a lot to me, if not only for entertainment, but it inspires me because of just how creative you get with the formats you use.
[225:31.99]Keep on keeping on.
[225:32.71]Cheers from Houston.
[225:34.93]Thank you.
[225:35.99]Thank you, Toomindiv.

[225:59.18]Thank you, Gatorhead.
[226:00.86]Thank you, Honorable Pleb, for the $10.

[226:07.35]God bless.
[226:08.63]God bless you, too.
[226:10.69]God bless us, every one of us.
[226:13.23]Almost fell out.
[226:14.01]That was almost embarrassing.
[226:17.06]That was almost embarrassing.
[226:21.92]Hairline's still there.
[226:22.70]It's fading, but it's still there.
[226:24.16]Don't make fun of me.
[226:26.40]Vertical, thanks for the $1.
[226:27.50]Hey, Jerma, good to see you.
[226:28.36]I'm actually playing Dark Souls 3 right now, and I'm trying to beat Dancer of the Boreal Valley, and I remember that you beat this boss first try.
[226:34.14]What a good gamer.
[226:40.04]Yeah, it was nothing.
[226:43.57]Birthday in five minutes.
[226:46.17]Good luck with Dark Souls, man.
[226:48.35]Discount VR.
[226:49.21]Thanks for the two bucks.
[226:49.93]Did you ever watch the Thank You Ster Thank You Jerma video I sent you a couple streams ago before your vet visit?
[226:55.27]I did not.
[226:56.91]I did not.
[226:59.83]Please give it to me again.
[227:01.31]Because now I have some time here where I'm not running all over the place.
[227:06.88]Send it to me in Discord.
[227:08.92]Send it to one of the mods and I will watch it.
[227:10.26]Actually, is it on the subreddit?
[227:18.25]See him after class.
[227:21.11]Okay.
[227:21.79]I'll watch it there.
[227:23.29]Just haven't had an opportunity to really sit down.
[227:25.17]This is the first time I've been at my computer even in more than like 11 days.
[227:30.44]So I need to kind of get back in the swing of things.
[227:33.74]Thank you, Ster.
[227:34.36]Thank you, Jerma Video.
[227:36.54]I'm sure it's fucking fantastic.
[227:37.96]Thank you for even making it.
[227:41.86]Uh, then Witching Who gave a bunch of gifted subs, too.
[227:45.56]Gave like five or ten of them.
[227:47.54]Thank you, Witching Who.
[227:49.70]Or Watching Who.
[227:51.37]Thank you for that.
[227:54.67]Thank you, Eefs for the one dollar.
[227:56.07]About what you're saying about the like trade infringement thing.
[227:59.67]I have a similar but not so similar occurrence.
[228:02.27]I modded a big Discord server for this dumb YouTuber.
[228:06.44]And a fangirl was claiming that she was dating him.
[228:11.64]And she was staking out his house and got fined and she went to jail.
[228:20.34]That's, um... Damn.
[228:26.86]That's kind of fucking crazy.
[228:30.76]What's with the comb?
[228:31.68]It's just, it's stupid.
[228:33.55]It's just there because I don't know what to do with my hands.
[228:38.53]Which would imply it would have to be in my hands.
[228:45.34]But thank you, Yves.
[228:46.72]Thank you, KXE501.
[228:48.46]Welcome back, KXE.

[233:14.25]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[233:15.63]Perhaps unboxing an electronic isn't hard, but being entertaining is.
[233:18.69]I could say playing video games is easy.
[233:22.46]Just saying.
[233:28.06]Yeah, that's true, but... I mean...
[233:34.05]I don't know.
[233:34.59]I think there's something objectively more difficult.
[233:37.59]Like, if you play a video game, you have to control the video game.
[233:40.17]You know what I mean?
[233:41.93]There's, like, hard shit to do in a lot of these games.
[233:44.31]You have to focus.
[233:46.23]There's a lot of things going on that you're controlling.
[233:52.28]You ordering a package from Amazon and, like, the guy rings your doorbell and you take it into your house and you just, like, silently open it.
[234:00.24]You just opened a package from Amazon.
[234:12.27]Watch wait, what what?
[234:16.26]Yeah, we we're going we're going we're going I you think I dreamed me watching a video wait, what?

[235:04.23]You'll have... You're gonna have decades worth of content there.
[235:08.74]That stream's gonna be four or five hours long, probably.
[235:11.12]Oh, no, it's not.
[235:11.88]That stream would be like two to three, maybe.
[235:14.82]There's gonna be three hours of me doing very specific tasks in front of a green screen that you can do whatever the fuck you want with.
[235:21.20]As long as it's PG-13 and, you know, maybe it's PG-13 to R and no fucked up weird shit.
[235:25.93]And don't make me do anything bad or say anything fucking insane or horrible.
[235:29.19]But do whatever you want.
[235:33.63]But thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[235:34.97]I just want to point out that the clips page for the past 24 hours is absolutely filled with that face image.
[235:41.76]Hey, Vinny Sticks, thanks for the $1.
[235:43.46]Merry Christmas.
[235:44.04]Merry Christmas to you, too.
[235:45.02]Killcoat, thanks for the $1.
[235:46.16]I know I said it earlier that the stream sucked, but it was actually really great, so thank you.
[235:50.98]Also, don't forget to add me on Discord.
[235:56.70]Oh, right, yes.
[235:57.28]I've been gone for a week.

[236:00.52]I forgot.
[236:02.11]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[236:03.55]Now we need a clip of Markiplier reacting to you, reacting to him, reacting to you.
[236:08.86]I just was crying.
[236:09.70]Like, that's going to be weird.
[236:10.86]He's going to be like, that's going to freak him out.
[236:12.52]Don't do that.
[236:14.02]That Fallout guy, thanks for the $15, Fallout guy.
[236:16.42]Hey, Jerma, keep up the great work.
[236:17.43]Haven't laughed this hard in years.
[236:20.07]Thank you.
[236:21.03]Also, look into RimWorld.
[236:22.23]It's a great game.
[236:24.35]I've heard it's a fantastic game.
[236:25.43]Thank you for the $15.
[236:26.91]Hey, future gamer, thanks for the three bucks.
[236:30.05]People who have gifted subs by other people can renew their sub for another month during September for only a dollar.
[236:37.32]The other $4 will be given by Amazon.
[236:43.14]Wait, really?
[236:44.29]If you have a gifted sub right now, you have to spend a dollar to keep it for the next month.
[236:54.55]Subtember is what it's called.
[237:00.25]That's kind of crazy, actually.
[237:02.27]That's pretty fucking cool.
[237:06.34]What about the person that gifted the subs?
[237:08.60]So they dumped fucking hundreds of dollars, maybe?
[237:11.68]Here's all the gifted subs!
[237:13.84]And then it's like... That's interesting.
[237:19.16]Only gifted this... Okay, I get it.
[237:20.36]It has to be gifted this month.
[237:21.75]I see.
[237:25.87]subs are half price they do stuff like this sometimes but that's kind of cool that if you get a gifted sub in September that you can just stay subbed for a dollar cool maybe some of you guys that have got gifted subs tonight can re-up them if you feel like for a dollar you don't have to though don't feel like you need to
[237:53.23]So this is a calm stream with a stream wall.
[237:54.91]I'll be reading the bits.
[237:55.95]And we're getting close to being done.
[237:58.29]Maybe like another 15, 20 minutes.
[237:59.79]Not even.
[238:02.91]But thank you.
[238:03.70]Thank you, Sleepy Pigeon, for the $1.
[238:05.12]Look into taking some hydrozyme for the gas.
[238:08.70]It works wonders.
[238:09.86]As for lower back pain, you need to work on your posture.
[238:11.96]My stepdad is a pain specialist.
[238:14.36]And you wouldn't believe how many people have chronic pain due to bad posture in your youth.
[238:18.31]By the way, happy almost birthday.
[238:19.55]Thank you.
[238:23.50]I feel like my posture isn't terrible keep me honest about that though thank you sleepy pigeon uh crimbalt thanks for the one dollar are you gonna go to gordon ramsay's restaurant in Vegas I already did I already did and it was it was the best food I've ever had it was probably the best food I've ever eaten in my life
[238:54.15]It was fucking ridiculous.
[239:03.26]Ramsay's the real deal.
[239:04.38]Oh, I... That shit was EXPENSIVE.
[239:09.87]EXPENSIVE.
[239:13.87]What'd you have?
[239:14.53]I had a steak from Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse.
[239:21.07]Wow.
[239:22.92]It was fucking insane.
[239:25.57]And I'm gonna be paying off that tab for a couple of weeks.
[239:31.63]I paid for that steak.
[239:36.17]I ate it raw.
[239:37.53]No, I don't eat rare steak.
[239:38.99]I can't.
[239:39.81]It freaks me out.
[239:41.43]I don't eat, like, well-done steak, though.
[239:43.73]Let me just be clear.
[239:45.50]I just don't like eating rare steak.
[239:47.94]Medium rare, medium, yeah, I'm fine.
[239:50.22]But like, I don't do the rare steak thing.
[239:53.76]Uh-uh.
[239:56.00]No, not me.
[239:58.72]It's just like, it's fucking beef sushi.
[240:00.72]I don't like it.
[240:06.17]But, medium.
[240:08.25]Medium, medium rare is fine.
[240:09.93]Medium most of the time when I order.
[240:14.11]Uh, anyways.
[240:16.10]Thank you, too.
[240:19.07]Thank you, Crimbalt, for that.
[240:20.05]Yeah, it was a great restaurant.
[240:21.03]If you ever get a chance, if you're in Vegas and you feel like deleting a shitload of money from your bank account, go to Gordon Ramsay Steak.
[240:29.43]Best steak I've ever had in my life.
[240:30.67]And I don't even, I barely, I rarely eat steak.
[240:32.29]And this is just not working anymore, so I'm just gonna take it out.
[240:36.25]It's the best piece of meat I've ever eaten.
[240:40.55]For sure.

[242:33.72]Thank you, Etalyx, for the two dollars.
[242:35.18]I've got a question that I really need asking.
[242:37.30]Who invented bread?
[242:38.74]Who invented beard?
[242:40.48]Who had the idea to mix water with flour and yeast and wait and then punch it and then put it in the oven?
[242:45.92]Who was the genius and why isn't there a holiday celebrating the genius?
[242:51.29]Um... I don't know.
[242:53.57]I don't know who made bread.
[242:58.25]Yeah, wasn't bread made by accident?
[243:00.91]I feel like all foods were made by accident.
[243:06.82]Every food that you love, that you're a huge fan of.
[243:09.12]Somebody accidentally came up with that because they fucked something else up.
[243:17.54]Is bread a fruit or a vegetable?
[243:19.44]Well, it grows in the ground, so it's a vegetable.
[243:30.42]Wasn't an important type of medicine made by letting food rot?
[243:34.90]Pretty much.
[243:36.67]But thank you to Jimmy John.
[243:39.19]Thank you, Jimmy John, for the 10 bucks.
[243:42.81]I finally made it to one of your live streams after mooching off your stream archive and old channel.
[243:49.11]Welcome, Jimmy John.
[243:51.32]Thank you for the 10 bucks and welcome to the stream.
[243:54.10]KXE501, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[243:56.24]Glad to see you back, Jeremy.
[243:57.46]Been missing your streams, my man.
[243:59.04]Also, on a side note, I'd love to see you take a crack at Yakuza now that it's on Steam.
[244:04.50]It is on Steam, isn't it?
[244:06.59]Hmm.
[244:07.79]Interesting.
[244:08.85]It is on Steam.
[244:13.59]Thank you, KXE.
[244:14.89]I'll have to look into that.
[244:17.51]I'll look into it.
[244:18.71]It's like 20 bucks?
[244:19.95]It's $20?
[244:22.71]That's a steal.
[244:24.55]Hey, Sandraker, thanks for the $1.
[244:25.71]Hey, Jerma, this is going to sound weird, but I've been going through a rough time for a long time now.
[244:33.27]And I could really use just someone saying it's gonna be okay with something like that.
[244:37.76]I have very little positive energy right now.
[244:39.52]I need something to perk me up.
[244:43.16]Anyway, here's a dollar.
[244:45.88]Well, uh, first of all, I'm sorry that you're going through a tough time for that long.
[244:54.02]And second of all, stick with it!
[244:58.11]Keep your head up, man.
[245:00.07]You said that's all you need, but...
[245:04.10]It's... That's not really all you need.
[245:07.00]You know what I mean?
[245:07.58]Like, I understand what you're saying here, but... I hope you feel better.
[245:15.31]And I hope you take the steps necessary to be able to let yourself be better.
[245:20.47]You know?
[245:24.69]Thank you for being here.
[245:27.21]Take it slow.
[245:29.15]Not a sprint.
[245:34.18]And see the love coming from the chat right now.
[245:38.31]Perk yourself up.
[245:41.31]But take it slow and do it right.
[245:44.00]There is no... Everything's here.
[245:48.88]Here is how you feel now.
[245:49.90]And then it's done.
[245:51.02]The snapping is over.
[245:51.82]Snap your fingers and then you can just be done.
[245:54.17]It's a process.
[245:58.07]Just don't try to force yourself to fix an issue immediately.
[246:03.90]Sometimes it takes a while.
[246:08.53]I wish you the best of luck.
[246:09.77]Take care of yourself.
[246:12.93]And we're all very happy for you to be here.
[246:18.69]Where's this going?
[246:20.35]Right there.
[246:22.09]I'm referencing when he says, I just need somebody to say, it's going to be okay.
[246:31.07]And where I'm going with that is it sometimes takes a lot longer than that.
[246:37.01]Do I plan on having kids?
[246:40.99]No, never.
[246:43.47]I will never have children.
[246:47.14]That is a guarantee.
[246:49.30]If you see a baby announcement, hey guys, there's a baby.
[246:53.58]That was a big mistake.
[246:55.64]And wasn't planned and wasn't something I ever thought was going to happen.
[246:59.82]If you see like a, hey, the baby's in town.
[247:03.71]Oh no, something, that was not, the baby wasn't supposed to come out.
[247:06.37]The baby wasn't supposed to be a baby.
[247:09.07]It just, I wasn't ready for that one.
[247:13.82]Clip it.
[247:14.34]Clip it.
[247:14.78]Clip it.
[247:15.30]You can clip it.
[247:15.76]It's not going to happen.
[247:16.70]It's not going to happen.
[247:17.40]Clip it.
[247:17.98]Clip it a hundred times.
[247:20.10]That's what they all say.
[247:21.70]Yes, that is what they all say.
[247:23.54]Except here's the difference.
[247:25.86]When I say something, I mean it.
[247:29.09]And I don't go back on it.
[247:31.53]I stick with it.
[247:33.41]And my opinion is you have to stick with your guns.
[247:37.75]You know what I mean?
[247:38.93]Which is why the most leg-rooming coach...
[247:43.61]by compare it to any other airline.
[247:47.78]Sodas are free.
[247:49.20]Chips are free.
[247:54.90]Barely any cancellations or delays.
[247:57.65]They're at a 98% satisfaction rating.
[248:01.25]They don't cancel your flight when you get to the terminal.
[248:05.65]Doesn't happen.
[248:13.81]But seriously though, Sandbreaker, take care of yourself.
[248:17.31]I wish you the best.
[248:20.23]Like I said before though, try to take care of yourself slowly.
[248:25.03]And do what you can.
[248:26.89]Thank you MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[248:28.45]I prefer my airlines to include a complimentary punch in the teeth.
[248:33.37]Not on JetBlue.
[248:35.81]Thank you N99 for the $1.
[248:38.41]Change of topics.
[248:39.23]Am I a bot?
[248:40.05]You could be.
[248:42.13]mean you could this could be like an automated bot bit message I don't know I have no idea you could be hey uh moosey thank you moosey for the bits thank you the doctor forever for the bits thank you ziatro for the one dollar how much money to get you to tell us your phone number a million dollars if if right now you give me a million dollars and then 30 days go by it goes into my bank account
[249:10.96]and it's cleared by the bank that it is my money in that bank account, then that's the only scenario.
[249:22.27]Like we're talking like, it's got to be like 30 to 60 days before I would be, okay, that's it.
[249:28.11]This is my, it's my money now.
[249:33.14]Million and I'm talking a million taxed not a million pre-tax.
[249:37.25]We're talking like 1.4 million dollars So post tax in my bank account would be a million dollars in cash You could just change your phone number it doesn't matter doesn't matter not gonna happen That's enough time to get a new phone number
[250:08.89]No, I'm saying post tax.
[250:10.77]Like you give me 1.4 million and like the IRS gets $400,000, which is what it would probably end up being.
[250:16.44]I would pay my taxes.
[250:19.62]I'm paying my taxes, guys.
[250:25.34]U.S.
[250:25.64]dollars, by the way.
[250:27.18]United States million dollars post tax.

[251:08.26]Nothing.
[251:08.60]I don't think so.
[251:10.37]I can't meet any of these.

[251:35.75]Thank you for the...
[251:37.37]$10, $20, $30 tonight.
[251:39.33]Thank you.
[251:41.11]I'm barefoot.
[251:41.67]Yes, I am.
[251:42.53]Is there a problem?
[251:43.07]You have a problem with that?
[251:46.91]I mean, do you get an issue with that?
[251:50.67]Should I go put on, like, should I go put on clogs right now?
[251:56.84]But thank you, KXE.
[251:57.66]Thank you, Sandbreaker, again, for the $1.
[252:00.80]I've started streaming recently.
[252:02.14]This is not a plug or anything.
[252:03.20]I just wanted to ask you if you could use your voice as a follower alert.
[252:06.99]Something like one of the rat songs I would give full credit.
[252:10.05]Of course.
[252:10.45]Yeah, that's fine.
[252:11.71]Yeah, don't even worry about that.
[252:12.57]That's Since I still got space here any tips for a streamer just starting out not trying to get thousands of viewers But just having a few people watch makes it so much more enjoyable It's hard to give streaming advice Because it I don't know what you know, I don't know what you're trying to do.
[252:31.26]I
[252:32.04]You know what I mean?
[252:33.26]Are you just passing time and having fun and relaxing?
[252:35.79]Are you trying to make an entertainment stream?
[252:38.41]Are you trying to go to gameplay?
[252:40.29]There's a ton of ways to do Twitch.
[252:42.65]So, it's hard to give advice to specific people as you know exactly what they're trying to do.
[252:49.82]Networking is huge.
[252:51.20]I mean, I don't do it at all.
[252:53.68]But back before when I was starting, how the hell do you think I met some of these guys, right?
[253:00.28]Let's go back and just talk about, like, Shibby2142.
[253:02.36]You guys know him.
[253:04.38]We didn't know each other.
[253:05.38]Like, we just both were doing the same thing, and we were both in the same kind of ballpark, and we started talking.
[253:09.80]Star, you know, has turned into, obviously, one of my good friends.
[253:15.75]We were just doing the same thing.
[253:17.27]Etalyx, these are all people.
[253:18.77]That was essentially networking.
[253:24.09]But it's not.
[253:25.51]I wouldn't classify it as that.
[253:28.42]Stop playing with the comb.
[253:29.28]It's extremely distracting.
[253:35.16]I'll keep it here.
[253:37.95]Yeah, that's probably the best advice I can give.
[253:41.43]Because there really is no magic formula to be like, hey, just do this and you'll end up with viewers.
[253:49.16]The internet is so...
[253:51.03]volatile.
[253:52.17]There's so many people looking for so many different things that it's impossible to predict the future in what is how to get viewers or how to grow a channel.
[254:03.08]It's hard for me to give any advice like that.
[254:07.38]It looks like a CSGO knife.
[254:11.74]Hydrate.
[254:12.16]I'm fine.
[254:17.40]I'm fine.
[254:20.18]I wasn't looking for whatever the fuck this is.
[254:26.17]But you're here now.
[254:27.79]You're here now, aren't you?
[254:30.65]Right?
[254:30.89]It's just that there's no... Sometimes there's no rhyme or reason to it.
[254:34.65]But thank you for being here, by the way.
[254:37.34]Hopefully that makes some sense to you, Sandricker.
[254:39.68]Thanks for the $1.
[254:40.60]I wish you the best of luck.
[254:44.96]are so many small streamers that focus on your current viewers and don't worry of slow growth it's all luck right now but it's that's without networking yeah I look I've got this I've come from a different world right like when I started youtube there wasn't very many people doing this this was a brand new thing back in like 2010 2011
[255:07.10]Call of Duty, people were making Call of Duty videos.
[255:10.48]And there were like four guys that had more than like 50 to 100,000 views a video.
[255:17.77]It's exponentially increased in the amount of people that started doing it, right?
[255:22.29]So my advice of, yeah, just do it and have fun.
[255:27.64]It's a different, the playing field is different now.
[255:31.14]There are tens of thousands, if not potentially hundreds of thousands of people all doing it, right?
[255:40.02]So you just have to, you just have to try, right?
[255:43.38]Try and do something that you don't typically see every day, or if you're really good at something, then show it.
[255:50.81]And networking is your friend at this point, I would say.
[255:55.23]Yeah, there was a time when a million views was just unheard of.
[255:59.06]I remember when, like, when, like, Sea Nanners was getting 200,000 views, and it was like,
[256:05.81]Wow, that's fucking insane.
[256:08.97]It was insane to see that.
[256:14.25]They're just called Fortnite videos now.
[256:18.80]I just, that was crazy.
[256:20.14]That was, it was like nothing that I've ever seen before.
[256:22.44]I used to watch Cena every day.
[256:27.16]Cena, he was like one of the first people that was really making popular gaming videos.
[256:31.42]That was back when your videos could get shut off.
[256:34.75]Some of the publishers would actually like, if you made a GTA 4 video five, six years ago, you would get like your channel turned off.
[256:43.92]They used to do that shit.
[256:46.40]It's not like it is now.
[256:52.88]They still can do that today.
[256:54.68]Yeah.
[256:58.85]When did you feel like I made it, I can do this YouTube thing?
[257:05.61]I never feel like I've made it because I don't want to put like a ceiling, right?
[257:14.60]I want to just keep trying as hard as I can and wherever I end up is where I end up when I'm done.
[257:24.10]Because once you start to think and say that you've made it, I did it, I made it, that's when you, oh, oh, you did, that's it, you made it.
[257:32.32]There's the ceiling you just made for yourself.
[257:39.12]And then you allow yourself to kind of stay there or go below.
[257:42.88]And that's not about how good or bad you are at something.
[257:50.16]It's just like when you put the limit on yourself, you get comfortable.
[257:59.66]I don't want to get comfortable.
[258:04.97]Do you remember peaked in kindergarten?
[258:08.42]I probably did.
[258:10.68]You're talking to somebody that peaked in the fucking fourth grade.
[258:13.54]Take my advice with a grain of salt.
[258:23.86]That's a great attitude to have when you want to keep improving.
[258:29.12]Yeah, I think that you just should.
[258:31.08]I think that improvement is...
[258:33.63]Look, can you see what I just did?
[258:34.61]Look at that.
[258:34.95]Like, let me tell you something.
[258:35.91]That's why I should start wearing glasses, man.
[258:39.27]You know, improvement.
[258:41.16]What does that word mean?
[258:43.38]I don't get to fucking do that shit.
[258:44.90]I'm going to start wearing these now.
[258:49.84]Who made these?
[258:51.84]What company made these?
[258:54.90]Are these Ralph Lauren's?
[258:56.24]I think these are Ralph Lauren's.
[258:58.28]Yeah.
[258:59.14]Whoa, these are expensive.
[259:00.42]When did I buy these?
[259:05.09]You can't see it, it says Ralph Lauren.
[259:07.43]These are Ralph Lauren's.
[259:10.09]Whoa, why am I so surprised by this?
[259:13.05]I bought these.
[259:14.55]How much were those?
[259:16.45]God damn.
[259:24.61]But thank you to Mostly Harmless for the bits.
[259:29.14]Thank you, Void Space, for the three dollars.
[259:30.61]Jeremy, I love everything you do, and you deserve to be confident and even a little egotistical.
[259:34.57]No, I don't.
[259:35.55]You've helped so many people get through hard times, and we all love you to pieces.
[259:38.63]Thank you so much, but... I'm not always going to take it off, but that was just... I don't want to be like an egomaniac.
[259:50.10]I don't want to be one of those people.
[259:58.49]You've been selling out this whole stream.
[260:00.29]Now, I never told you I liked Ralph Lauren's.
[260:02.01]I just own them.
[260:07.39]Is he flexing on us?
[260:08.52]What?
[260:10.48]What do you mean flexing on you?
[260:11.74]What are you talking about?
[260:12.46]I got pants on.
[260:17.76]Look.
[260:18.68]This is not my fat stomach.
[260:19.88]There it is.
[260:21.74]Look, I got my hands in my pockets.
[260:23.66]Those of you guys that have a fat fucking stomach like me, here's a tip for you.
[260:28.95]You know, if you got one of these front pocket things here.
[260:31.21]Oh, wow.
[260:34.42]Let's walk around like New York City.
[260:36.76]Okay.
[260:37.66]Whoa.
[260:38.70]Wow, that's cool right there.
[260:40.00]Oh, Eiffel Tower.
[260:41.10]Wow, I'm surprised.
[260:42.86]It looks like that up close.
[260:44.82]That's the secret.
[260:46.34]That's the secret.
[260:47.04]Because without it, you die and look bad.
[260:53.26]It works.
[260:54.54]It's a great tip.
[260:57.01]How did this go?
[261:00.51]Something like that.
[261:03.21]Shorts, not pants.
[261:04.07]It's the same thing.
[261:04.79]Are shorts pants?
[261:10.00]Are shorts pants?
[261:14.22]Yes, they are.
[261:14.72]I win.
[261:27.25]Hey, thanks, Big Mama for the $5.
[261:31.14]Yo, Jerma, it's me, Bob.
[261:34.51]Meet poo-poo, pee-poo, poo-poo.

[261:40.84]Great stuff.
[261:46.91]Thank you, Big Muff.
[261:48.01]Thank you, Slaazer Shoof.
[261:51.25]Thank you, Slay Shofy, for the 10 bucks.
[261:53.51]Hey, mister, wanted to let you know that your Twitch jacket looks good on you, and I am not in an A-O-W-O way.
[261:59.09]Hey.
[262:00.57]Thanks.
[262:01.17]I like this.
[262:01.57]This is my favorite color.
[262:04.05]Thank you.
[262:05.75]Butter Derp, thanks for the $1.
[262:06.97]Shit, I wasn't supposed to blow all this money, but I had to ask, when you're not streaming, do you play games, and what games do you play?
[262:13.23]Uh, iPad.
[262:20.05]I play on the iPad.
[262:30.42]I deserve to be 33.
[262:31.32]Thank you, though.
[262:42.70]Thank you, Star Catfish, for the $5.
[262:44.10]Frankerzy, Frankerzy, Frankerzy.
[262:46.02]Hey, Jerma, it was just recently...
[262:49.45]It just recently that I remembered finding you and Star's YouTube channel back in the seventh grade.
[262:55.27]I'm in college now.
[262:56.11]Thanks for the entertainment.
[263:01.79]Now I am 33.
[263:02.59]That's a long... Think about that.
[263:07.36]Seventh grade.
[263:08.32]Dude's in college now.
[263:11.50]I've been doing this for a long time, huh?
[263:15.14]It's been like seven years.
[263:18.14]Holy shit.
[263:27.68]Wow.
[263:29.16]It hits you like a fucking habanero.
[263:32.68]No, say it correctly.
[263:34.32]Habanero.
[263:35.70]Habanero.
[263:37.83]It hits you like a habanero.
[263:39.69]You know what I'm saying?
[263:41.05]Right in the gut.
[263:47.05]He tried.
[263:49.23]Thank you, Star Catfish, though.
[263:50.30]Thank you to Nate Dog for the $1.
[263:52.32]You're my hero.
[263:54.64]Thank you for that.
[263:58.27]Thank you for thinking that.
[264:00.81]Although... I mean, thanks, I guess, thank you.
[264:08.23]You know what?
[264:11.28]Thank you.
[264:15.12]I'm gonna have a headache because I'm wearing these.
[264:17.74]I see a gray hair, good.
[264:21.14]This is gonna be, this is gonna be Anderson Cooper in like fucking two weeks.
[264:29.02]But thank you, NateDog.
[264:29.72]Thank you, JackTheMac, for the five bucks.
[264:33.44]Kappa, today's my 25th month sub-anniversary.
[264:37.62]That's a long time to pay somebody five dollars a month.
[264:43.43]That's more than two years.
[264:46.67]Thank you so much, dude.
[264:49.97]Glad.
[264:52.87]Glad you're having fun.
[264:56.73]Thank you to Kerr for the two bucks.
[264:59.07]Hey man, you're cool.
[265:00.33]Hope the move goes well.
[265:01.33]Been rough recently, but watching you makes me feel a little less lonely.
[265:04.48]You've been entertaining me for many years, and here's to many more.
[265:07.00]From my heart.
[265:10.28]Thank you.
[265:13.38]Stay tuned.
[265:15.02]That's like the year of Vegas.
[265:20.70]There's gonna be all kinds of fucking crazy shit.
[265:24.39]You can quote me on that.
[265:26.49]You can quote me on that.
[265:29.86]How much I move to Vegas and I don't even do anything?
[265:33.88]What if I just did IRL comb streams every day in Vegas?
[265:37.72]And I don't ever do... Yeah, I move to Vegas because it's close to LA and I just do this every day.
[265:43.26]God, that would be bad.
[265:46.74]Just do it.
[265:47.40]No, I'm not going to do that.
[265:50.34]Thank you, though.
[265:51.83]Thank you, Kerr.
[265:54.10]Thank you.
[265:54.38]It's time for Slime for the $5.
[265:55.55]Hey, Jerma, no silly animation this time.
[265:57.85]Just glad you're back.
[265:58.65]Take care.
[265:59.13]Here's hoping all goes well.
[266:00.11]Thank you, Slime.
[266:01.79]Don't ever... I don't ever expect an animation from you.
[266:06.02]You bang those out very quickly and you're very talented.
[266:09.08]And I know they take a lot of work, so... That's all good that there's no animation.
[266:13.84]You don't have to worry about that.
[266:15.53]Thank you so much for your $5.
[266:21.84]My hair's not thick enough to deal with what I'm doing right now.
[266:27.09]But thanks for the five bucks, man.
[266:28.01]Thank you.
[266:28.43]Evergreen for the one dollar.
[266:30.27]Darkstar for the one dollar.
[266:31.37]Greenscreen idea.
[266:32.47]Advertisements where we could place any product in your hand.
[266:36.32]Then you can shop them around to companies such as a certain beloved airline.
[266:44.23]There's lots of ideas.
[266:46.80]Untold Sewage, thanks for the $1.
[266:48.22]Hey, Jeremiah, you're one of my favorite people on the internet.
[266:50.20]Here in Texas, all we can fly on is American.
[266:54.04]Love in the stream.
[266:55.02]I'm sorry to hear that.
[266:56.90]Sorry you don't get to experience the quality of JetBlue.
[267:01.55]It's unfortunate.
[267:04.23]Hey, Peter, thanks for the $5.
[267:05.45]Can you talk about JetBlue some more?
[267:08.73]I don't know.
[267:10.27]I don't know.
[267:10.79]I feel like I shouldn't talk that much about it.
[267:14.20]I'm not going to say very much about their incredibly competitive prices and their multiple cities, their multiple connections.
[267:23.68]There's not much else to say, you know?
[267:27.67]Thank you, though.
[267:29.77]Hey, NKBC, thanks for the $1.
[267:31.83]Thank you, Jilio, for the $1.
[267:33.29]Thank you, Flank Tank.
[267:35.15]Flank Tank for the $2.
[267:36.97]Here's some welcome back bits.
[267:38.07]Thank you so much, dude.
[267:39.90]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[267:43.82]Uh, yo Jerma, sorry to bring the mood down, but the girlfriend I mentioned a while ago broke up with me on my birthday.
[267:52.85]That's not good.
[267:55.37]Uh, Garf had a bad time with girls in recent years.
[267:57.45]My first girlfriend was abusive, but the second one cheated on me.
[268:00.50]This one ignored me for four months before dumping me on my birthday.
[268:05.63]Thanks for keeping me going in these dark times.
[268:07.71]How can you know if a gal actually likes you or at least cares enough not to scrooge you over?
[268:16.35]Well, first, that's fucking horrible.
[268:18.17]Sorry about that, Garfield.
[268:19.57]Sorry that that's happening to you.
[268:22.05]Second of all, there's no real magic way to say this.
[268:30.30]I didn't have a girlfriend for a long time.
[268:34.16]Doesn't mean I didn't want it and try or whatever.
[268:36.44]You just eventually have to hope that you find somebody that you can spend time with, that you enjoy their time and their company, right?
[268:48.31]I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[268:51.89]But much love to you, Garfield.
[268:53.87]Remember when I was on Tinder?
[268:57.59]Oh, yeah, I was on Tinder.
[268:58.83]I was swiping.
[268:59.83]I was very selective on Tinder, though.
[269:04.48]Like, friends of mine would just like, yeah, dude, just go like this.
[269:08.48]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[269:09.34]And I'm just like, what the fuck are you doing?
[269:10.94]What are you doing?
[269:11.44]Why are you doing that for?
[269:13.20]I would sit there and meticulously, I don't, I don't know.
[269:16.44]I don't think so.
[269:19.58]Another one would be like, hmm.
[269:22.50]I don't know.
[269:24.16]Would she read in bed?
[269:27.68]No, I don't think so.
[269:29.84]I would like, I would go, I would swipe right.
[269:32.96]on like 3% of every single person.
[269:40.38]It wasn't a looks thing more than it was, like, I don't know, I just, I'm a weirdo.
[269:47.45]And what the hell was I doing on Tinder in the first place?
[269:50.37]That place is a shithole.
[269:52.58]That place is not, I didn't have any luck.
[269:54.50]I got stood up on Tinder, by the way.
[269:57.06]I had a Tinder date that fucking didn't come.
[269:59.66]She didn't show up.
[270:03.99]I told you guys about that.
[270:05.11]Didn't I on stream one time?
[270:06.14]I was told to get it.
[270:17.95]It was like the hot new app.
[270:19.41]I'll get it, man.
[270:21.29]Swipe right on people.
[270:33.35]Where am I?
[270:33.65]Oh, I'm streaming, right.
[270:35.61]Uh, thank you GT Juggernaut for the $4.
[270:38.67]I don't normally watch streams, but I don't want to waste my free sub in these 400 bits that I earned by totally watching a Jack Ryan episode.
[270:44.85]Wait, were they giving money if you watched a TV episode?
[270:50.97]You watched an episode of television and they gave you bits.
[270:54.13]What?
[270:54.47]Are you fucking serious?
[270:56.93]What?
[271:01.05]You watch, that's crazy.
[271:04.01]They gave you bits if you watched a TV show.
[271:07.77]Wow.
[271:08.41]That's next level.
[271:13.63]Caught it.
[271:14.57]You don't ever tell me that I don't have the reflexes of a goddamn moose.
[271:18.41]Because you just saw that happen in real time.
[271:20.03]Didn't even need to look.
[271:29.19]That's pretty genius.
[271:31.85]That is pretty genius.
[271:34.23]But thank you Juggernaut for the $4.
[271:37.03]Thank you Cardamon for the $1.
[271:38.57]I wore the Fireman shirt to my school and some people actually recognized it.
[271:42.69]Wow.
[271:45.23]That's surprising.
[271:47.09]Well, that's cool.
[271:47.63]At least you know that those people are, you know, approved by... Not by me.
[271:56.15]I don't even know what I'm trying to say here.
[271:58.01]That's cool though.
[271:58.61]That's actually pretty cool.
[272:00.17]That's very cool.
[272:02.04]Hey, Chris Fart.
[272:03.66]Thank you, Chris Fart, for the $1.
[272:04.92]Hey, Jerma, long-time listener, first-time caller, that Squilliam Tentacles comment made me laugh, so I made you this.
[272:20.63]Oh, damn it.
[272:21.11]Thank you, Chris Fartlet.
[272:23.67]Uh... Kyrinsky, thanks for the $1.
[272:25.97]What do you think of Best Buy?
[272:27.25]I'm curious.
[272:32.30]I don't know.
[272:32.68]Best Buy is kind of one of those places at this point, I think, where... It's just... Do I want to drive to Best Buy or do I just want to get this on Amazon?
[272:44.12]I used to go to Best Buy all the time.
[272:45.22]And then I realized that somebody would just drop off at my door the thing I was going to drive to go get.
[272:54.07]I don't dislike the store.
[272:55.15]I don't think there's anything wrong with the store.
[272:59.55]I feel like Walmart is turning into Best Buy.
[273:02.22]Because you can get everything at Best Buy that you can get at Walmart, except for graphics cards, right?
[273:06.34]Once Walmart starts selling like GTX 240s or whatever they are, that's gonna be rough.
[273:12.88]If Walmart starts to sell RAM and Nvidia graphics cards, that's gonna be rough on Best Buy.
[273:26.42]Walmart is on fire right now, by the way.
[273:30.71]Their company is just soaring right now.
[273:36.08]Somehow.
[273:36.88]I guess.
[273:45.84]Who said Havels?
[273:46.88]I'm going insane from the hunger.
[273:48.32]Havels?
[273:48.89]What?
[273:51.33]Best Buy's fine.
[273:53.65]I mean, their color scheme is top-notch.
[273:58.31]You got the blue...
[273:59.86]And the yellow, like the blue and yellow contrasted together.
[274:02.36]It reminds me of something else.
[274:05.22]Gosh, I just can't.
[274:06.58]The blue white with like orange and yellow.
[274:10.24]Man, it just, what the fuck does that remind me of?
[274:13.60]Some company that is fucking incredible.
[274:16.28]I just, it must be the color, something with that color scheme.
[274:19.77]I don't know what it is.
[274:24.47]But God, whatever that company I'm thinking of.
[274:26.13]You just can't get better than that.
[274:30.65]Thank you Untold Sewage for the $4.
[274:32.45]Thank you, the no message here.
[274:35.09]Moo means moo.
[274:37.03]We filmed that hangman bit a week ago, chat.
[274:39.40]Don't believe his lies.
[274:40.98]I hope to get the word out before it's too late.
[274:47.32]Mm-hmm.
[274:52.50]Always bet on JetBlue.
[274:54.74]I didn't say that.
[274:55.58]You did.
[274:59.78]Hmm.
[275:02.33]Isn't that interesting?
[275:04.95]Hey, Untold Sewage, thanks for the photo.
[275:06.28]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[275:07.54]How come you can't get JetBlue to sponsor your stream, but you can get McDonald's to sponsor your haircut?
[275:17.28]That was good.
[275:19.44]Untold Sewage, thanks for the $2.
[275:22.69]$3 here.
[275:24.13]What's your favorite conspiracy theory?
[275:27.27]Put the comb in your pocket if you're being forced to advertise JetBlue.
[275:31.87]A favorite conspiracy theory?
[275:33.55]I don't know.
[275:34.15]I don't have a favorite conspiracy theory.
[275:36.68]I don't know.
[275:44.22]Area 51.
[275:45.68]I want to see the alien.
[275:47.96]I think we all can agree.
[275:50.24]Show me the alien, right?
[275:51.68]Like, did it happen?
[275:52.98]Did a fucking spaceship crash?
[275:57.22]Just tell us.
[275:58.99]Everybody knows that aliens already exist in some universe.
[276:02.33]Did it happen?
[276:03.07]Like, it's not a big deal like that would have been back in, like, the 30s.
[276:08.86]Like, people still thought fire was scary and cool back in, like, the 30s and 40s.
[276:13.60]Like, come on, everyone has a computer now.
[276:15.68]We can, like, talk on the internet.
[276:17.84]Was it an alien or not?
[276:30.75]Is the moon made of cheese?
[276:32.92]Just tell us if the moon is made of cheese.
[276:35.40]Nobody would care.
[276:36.16]Okay, if Area 51 turned out to be real, if it was aliens are real, Area 51 was real.
[276:45.42]Do you know how the cycle of the internet works?
[276:47.88]Here's what would happen.
[276:48.58]You already know it.
[276:49.44]There would be a thread on Reddit with 15,000 upvotes for like three days.
[276:55.85]And then it would disappear and people would stop talking about it.
[277:00.94]It would be like a huge thing.
[277:02.18]There'd be tons of discussion inside of that thread.
[277:04.82]And then people would forget it happened in like two weeks.
[277:07.06]That's the nature of the internet.
[277:10.28]They don't like, what do you, what do you think is going to happen?
[277:14.24]It would, the attention would burn out.
[277:16.16]The Google search term for aliens are real would burn out faster than Bitcoin.
[277:26.82]In like Google search terms.
[277:35.28]I sense some real bitterness here.
[277:38.41]Is it because I said the Bitcoin thing?
[277:44.21]Look at this.
[277:48.53]Okay, this is... You know when you go into the salon or the haircut place?
[277:55.16]And there's the guy on a poster over there for some reason.
[277:58.76]And he has this haircut.
[278:00.80]And he's going like this.
[278:05.28]Nobody wants this haircut.
[278:11.96]Nobody got, you know, give me, give me that.
[278:14.24]When was the last time you, oh yeah, I'm sitting down in the chair.
[278:17.28]Oh, what can I do for you, sir?
[278:19.03]Uh, that one, that poster right there.
[278:21.35]I want, give me that guy.
[278:26.71]Some of these salons have books where you're supposed to point at the picture.
[278:29.19]No one does that.
[278:30.45]Everyone does the same thing when you go get a haircut.
[278:32.23]You know what it is?
[278:34.43]Okay, it's been like fucking two months since I've had a haircut.
[278:37.35]Hmm, I don't even know what the fuck I want.
[278:39.27]Okay, what can I do for you?
[278:40.27]Um... I don't know, just like take maybe like a two on the sides.
[278:49.72]And you want me to do it with scissors on the top?
[278:52.82]Uh, yeah.
[278:57.23]Like, it all goes the same way.
[278:59.28]Nobody like goes, well, I want to have one inch and then under here and then four and then flip it around.
[279:03.22]No, we all sit in the chair and we just go, I don't know, make me look better than I do now.
[279:11.76]I get a different haircut every single haircut because I always say the same thing.
[279:14.56]Well, you know, I like a little bit of length on top, but I don't want it too long, but I also want it short.
[279:19.83]So the thing I'm doing, I'm describing you going in a circle to do the thing that I had previously.
[279:28.16]Look, I'm just disappearing down here.
[279:29.40]Alright, almost done.
[279:33.03]Right at the end here.
[279:35.67]We've got... Uh, flank tank, three bucks.
[279:39.25]Also, just wanted to ask a quick question.
[279:40.79]And it's, um, it's a different language.
[279:42.46]I don't know what it says.
[279:43.96]I'm gonna say, uh, maybe, yes, or no.
[279:47.74]But thank you.
[279:48.52]Until the sewage.
[279:50.56]And that's not the right person.
[279:51.44]That's flank tank.
[279:53.22]Butterderp, thanks for the $1.
[279:54.82]I donated $10, not one.
[279:56.62]I told myself I wasn't going to donate anymore, but I did.
[279:58.82]I'm not an addict.
[279:59.52]You're just funny and inspirational.
[280:02.08]Thank you, Butterderp.
[280:02.98]Sorry for mispronouncing your donation.
[280:06.45]And it's all good.
[280:07.07]You don't have to donate anymore.
[280:08.37]You can just take a break and watch.
[280:10.97]Thank you, Butterderp.
[280:13.37]Uh, Erdemius, thanks for the $1.

[280:17.52]Thank you for doing what you do.
[280:18.42]Also, do you think you might take it, make it back this side of the states for PAX East?
[280:22.10]It was cool meeting you there.
[280:25.71]Sadly, no.
[280:27.07]I will not be going to PAX any convention for at least six months.
[280:32.71]Kind of need to refill the coffers.
[280:35.83]This trip is going to be a fairly large chunk of money over the next few months.
[280:41.58]Furnishing a place, moving everything out there, and maybe even hiring a moving company to ship a lot of stuff.
[280:46.52]I'm going to need to fill the coffers.
[280:51.56]You're at work watching this.
[280:55.33]Oh, you want me to be quiet?

[282:42.69]The price is now 27 cents.
[282:45.23]I will hold till I lose it all, but it still hurts to lose that much.
[282:48.73]Any advice?

[283:02.51]That's the advice.
[283:06.27]But we're the early adopters, man.

[283:22.52]Chinese New Year, man.
[283:23.46]That's what this is all about.

[285:21.04]I can't wait until you're 40-something and you've got a kid on the way, and every clip of you saying I'm never having kids comes back to bite you in the ass.
[285:29.26]No.
[285:29.91]That's not gonna happen.
[285:31.91]It's just not gonna happen.

[286:01.69]What is this?
[286:02.05]They're not having kids.
[286:06.06]No.
[286:06.82]See?
[286:07.10]No.
[286:07.36]That's fine.
[286:07.72]You don't use two.
[286:08.38]Don't use two.
[286:08.96]Are you crazy?
[286:13.93]It's weenie, thanks for the one dollar.
[286:15.43]Why do you use, like, dollar store earphones?
[286:17.95]Like, even in your old vids?
[286:19.19]Because I don't know.
[286:20.23]Because I just don't... I don't... I don't know.
[286:23.03]I don't... I don't know.
[286:24.61]I don't know.
[286:25.27]I don't know.
[286:29.48]These aren't... These are Bose headphones.
[286:31.84]Dollar store headphones.
[286:34.50]Look.
[286:34.70]Look.
[286:35.88]These are, okay, this one's broken, but if it looked good, it's Bose.
[286:42.75]You can't even, my, this camera sucks.
[286:46.47]It's Bose.
[286:47.91]These are Bose headphones.
[286:51.51]And they're supposed to look like this.
[286:53.01]Look.
[286:54.21]See?
[286:55.55]That one's broken, and it doesn't work anymore, so I don't use it.
[286:58.25]And I never used it because I don't like having it in my head.
[287:03.60]Listen, I'm too big right now.
[287:04.80]Get off the screen.
[287:05.74]You are making people sick.
[287:11.14]Where are we?
[287:12.56]Hey, Novi, thanks for the $3.33.
[287:14.84]Finally got the job I was gunning for.
[287:16.61]Now I can actually give bits more often.
[287:18.41]Take care of yourself first.
[287:19.41]Don't worry about me.
[287:20.93]Make sure that you are accounted for because you deserve that money because you did the hard work to get that job.
[287:25.63]Thank you so much.
[287:28.18]Take care of yourself first.
[287:30.84]But thank you, nonetheless.

[288:35.66]So Jack Ryan's just giving out money to people.

[288:43.29]Thanks for the Jack Ryan episode money.
[288:47.75]SeniorDelter again for the $1.
[288:48.99]Hey, Jeremiah, I just sent four bucks to you, but I don't know if you saw it.
[288:51.21]Just wanted to say I've been enjoying your content.
[288:53.11]Yep.
[288:54.65]Just pulled you up right there.
[288:55.63]Thank you, SeniorDelter.
[288:59.25]I hope you enjoyed Jack Ryan.
[289:00.51]Gabe, cool.
[289:01.01]Thanks for the $1.
[289:01.79]You're a cute anime boy.
[289:03.58]Not until 2019.
[289:04.36]I'm only allowed one per year.
[289:06.74]Butterderp, thanks for the $1.
[289:07.80]When you tell me no, it makes me want to do it more.
[289:09.55]I don't know what to tell you.
[289:13.87]Thank you.
[289:14.41]I'm sorry that you... I'm sorry that I'm like reverse psychology-ing you.
[289:18.51]But I don't mean to.
[289:20.23]Thank you, Butterderp.
[289:20.85]Thank you, Schlabazer, for the $1.
[289:21.89]Take a photo of your room, then set up a green screen in Vegas.
[289:25.82]Just tear it down.
[289:26.82]It's a new room.
[289:28.94]That'd be funny.
[289:29.62]And finally, Spooky Shpee.
[289:32.47]For the $1 here.
[289:33.21]Hey, Jerma, I'm just giving you the link to the Thank You, Star, and Jerma video just in case you missed it.
[289:37.69]I did not make the video.
[289:39.45]All credit goes to the creator.
[289:40.97]Thank you so much.
[289:42.31]I got it right here.
[289:43.73]And I'm able to watch it.
[289:44.59]I'm going to watch this in bed.
[289:46.68]I'm going to watch this lying down and just enjoy it.
[289:50.74]He said the thing.
[289:53.02]And with that, I will see you guys on Monday.
[289:58.54]Six and a half hours.
[289:59.30]Holy shit.
[290:01.37]Wow.
[290:04.12]I'm surprised this was this long.
[290:07.85]But much love to you all.
[290:08.87]Thank you so much.
[290:09.85]I'm back temporarily for a couple weeks here.
[290:13.37]We'll try to get some fun stuff going.
[290:15.49]Thanks for watching, as always.
[290:18.10]And have a great rest of your night.
[290:20.10]Or morning, if you're in the European Union.
[290:27.11]Good night.
