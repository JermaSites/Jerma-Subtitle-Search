[10:08.98]And...
[10:14.42]To be honest, I wasn't sure how you were going to solve this one.

[71:20.76]Wild.
[71:24.98]We have one F. Wow.
[71:26.17]Go ahead and take that wild card.
[71:32.35]Don't forget you have that wild card.
[71:33.97]Would you like to use it?
[71:35.73]Yes, we have some R.
[71:54.16]Don't go and spend all that at once now.
[71:56.20]I'm going to come in last place again.
[71:57.58]Oh, no.
[72:21.93]That's too bad.
[72:23.79]Next contestant, it's your turn.
[72:27.58]People.
[72:27.94]Okay, well, very obviously, I know what the second word is.
[72:39.81]Dude, why wouldn't they... Can they make a Wheel of Fortune with, like, Diablo II items?
[72:45.34]Like, can we do that?
[72:47.00]Like, I want, you know what I mean?
[72:48.22]Like, I want, that would be more interesting to me.
[72:50.12]Not doily fucking drawliners.
[72:54.23]Is there like a gamer version?
[72:56.99]Is it like a nerd version?
[73:02.94]Wow, not a single one on the board.
[73:05.36]I'm sorry.
[73:14.12]Scented Diablo II items.
[73:22.50]Dude, that's the virgin version.
[73:29.41]Okay.
[73:30.35]I actually know what this is.
[73:33.71]So I'm going to try to make some fucking money.
[73:36.75]I know the answer to this question.
[73:38.33]I'm going to try to make some money.
[73:41.60]Because I have to.
[73:42.18]I swear to God, I'm uninstalling the game right now.
[73:45.36]I'm going to uninstall it.
[73:46.34]That's like the sixth or seventh time I've landed on that.
[73:49.24]I've landed on that 40% of every spin.
[74:02.25]Bankrupt should...
[74:06.08]Bankrupt should not be in four spaces on the map.
[74:09.98]It should be in literally one.
[74:12.00]This shouldn't even be on the map.
[74:13.06]What's the point of that being there?
[74:19.00]I know this.
[74:26.29]I literally would say it out loud right now, but I still have a chance to make some money.
[74:34.43]Bankrupt.
[74:38.70]Bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt, loser turn, loser turn, bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt.
[74:57.81]Yeah, board of directors.
[75:00.55]Great.
[75:01.25]I would have been able to do that if this stupid fucking game that has been around since, like, 1700 didn't have bankrupt slots.
[75:16.40]You know, I'll never understand that.
[75:19.00]Some of these old games, there's, like, go to zero.
[75:23.39]on the board.
[75:24.77]But then there's also things are worth five times points in round three.
[75:29.59]What the hell?
[75:30.10]Are you even trying to have it be based on skill?
[75:32.06]Or are you having it be bullshit RNG nonsense dog shit?
[75:37.36]Bankrupt times five points.
[75:39.04]It doesn't matter.
[75:39.58]You only get one thing right in the fucking last round.
[75:41.56]Food and drink?
[75:58.57]I know it.
[76:00.25]I know it.
[76:00.61]Alright, dude, you made this joke like five times.
[76:15.53]What are you, me?
[76:32.25]How do I have a th- I just keep landing on bankrupt.
[76:47.09]I hate game shows that do this.
[76:50.19]It's so stupid.
[76:52.91]Go to zero!
[76:53.67]Times ten points!
[76:55.29]What's the point of having a fucking wheel if it doesn't matter until the last spin of the game?
[77:00.88]You heard the buzzer.
[77:02.14]That means time is up.
[77:04.32]Yes, we have some E's.
[77:08.32]Just have no rounds then.
[77:13.16]Contestant number one.
[77:14.99]Your chance to solve.
[77:22.95]No, it's not cheese.
[77:23.91]I don't know.
[77:38.07]No, we don't seem to have any of those.
[77:53.53]Yes, we have some S's.
[77:58.88]Well, that is a healthy amount to add to your winnings tonight.
[78:02.92]Contestant number three, your chance to solve.
[78:07.63]RNG bankruptcy is stupid Especially when you land on it Like ten times over the course of an hour
[78:52.66]Sleep.
[78:55.20]Sleep, idiot.
[78:58.03]Sleep, I don't know.
[78:59.11]Wait, just pass.
[78:59.71]Yeah, you gotta pass.
[79:00.83]Otherwise, you're gonna lose points.
[79:02.01]I don't know.
[79:08.67]I'm thinking like sheep.
[79:10.87]I don't know.
[79:12.57]Like sheep.
[79:15.21]Yes, we have some peas.
[79:22.78]I guess you'll be paying for dinner tonight.
[79:26.29]Contestant number two, would you like to solve?
[79:30.49]What?
[79:32.79]Oh, God damn it.
[79:34.96]How do I leave the game?
[79:41.66]I was, my brain was just like sheep pot pie.
[79:53.31]One more.
[79:54.69]And no more of this dogshit bankrupt RNG nonsense.
[79:57.65]But that's not even fair.
[80:07.54]I got bankrupt like three times.
[80:09.04]Our lucky contestant looks eager to start the bonus round, so let's get over there.
[80:21.74]should be a slaughter rule if you land on bankruptcy more than three times in a game you just get like five grand show bids there are six letters we can give you r s t l n and e let's see what kind of help would you please choose three consonants and a vowel nice scented draws
[80:52.94]You're having General Tso's tofu?

[81:43.68]It's a different menu item everywhere.
[81:53.74]Ten seconds remaining.
[82:01.93]While you got the most money, you didn't get the bonus.
[82:04.69]But I think you should still be happy with that.
[82:06.69]At different restaurants, it's General T-S-O?
[82:11.65]General T-S-O-T-O.

[103:09.47]That's not a phrase.
[103:10.67]That's not a before and after.
[103:11.55]You just picked three random words and put them together and instead it was a fucking random name.
[103:33.60]Time is running low.
[103:34.82]Only 10 seconds remaining.
[103:39.32]I already got it.

[105:16.41]How do you know that?
[105:37.36]I'm not gonna win.
[105:38.68]It's almost impossible.
[105:46.91]I gotta solve it.
[106:05.46]there's no way you know what this is camp
[106:31.41]Why are you both doing... Are these bots?
[106:33.03]Why are they both just doing the same exact word at the end?
[106:36.33]It's a bot.
[106:37.67]What?
[106:37.91]How is there no A in this whole thing?
[106:59.99]Will we get any help on this?
[107:02.09]It seems we're out of luck.
[107:08.40]What is this word, man?
[107:17.63]Unfortunately, there are none on the board.
[107:20.87]What?
[107:26.71]Unfortunately, there are none on the board.
[107:29.26]I'm sorry.
[107:34.70]Coin?
[108:07.35]Coin?
[108:08.29]No, dude!
[108:09.03]It's not a coin collector!
[108:10.69]Oh my god.
[108:15.61]Did I come in last place again?
[108:29.04]Alright, I'm doing one more.
[108:32.28]I'm doing a quick one.
[108:33.38]Very quick.
[108:33.82]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[108:35.30]Fast.
[108:39.05]Very fast.
[108:40.03]Incredibly fast.
[108:44.06]I'm doing one quick round and that's it.
[108:46.90]Did I miss any raids or anything?
[108:48.98]I was freaking out with the song thing.
[108:50.94]We were talking about Bjork and everything.
[109:00.67]Baseball diamond earrings?
[109:04.27]Would you follow me over here, please?
[109:07.15]Oh, that's okay.

[109:09.29]Oh, I get it.
[109:10.07]I thought it was, whatever.

[109:42.07]Good deeds.
[109:47.77]Do it.
[109:48.15]Do it.
[109:48.41]Do it for the joke.
[109:49.31]You won't.
[110:06.00]You won't do it.
[110:07.41]You won't do zoot deeds.
[110:08.61]No, you won't.
[110:15.87]What?
[110:16.31]No.
[110:17.49]Wait, how come you didn't fail?
[110:19.71]Why are you not failing this?
[110:22.44]If you get it wrong, you lose.
[110:25.56]What?
[110:25.72]I thought if you got it wrong, you lose.
[110:35.73]You can guess as many times as you want.
[110:37.01]I did not know that.
[110:37.75]Alright, let's do it.
[110:39.79]We are going for it.
[110:40.81]Quick round.

[111:41.89]The dust.
[111:42.55]You're talking about, like, the dust on your keyboard.
[111:46.03]What?
[111:46.27]That's... That's an old meme.
[111:47.31]With, like, the, oh, all the gamers gunk and junk that you have on your keyboard.

[123:01.06]Fashion and what designer?
[123:02.93]Aren't you just a fashion designer?
[123:04.93]You're not a fashion and something else.
[123:08.43]You're a fashion designer.
[123:12.10]What other kind of designer would you be?
[123:13.34]You're a fashion and something else.
[123:15.22]You're also this.
[123:31.19]Yes, we have some eyes.
[123:34.47]Contestant number three, your chance to solve.

[124:11.56]What?
[124:19.52]Fashion...
[124:32.91]I'm trying to fill in the second word.
[124:41.24]Isn't it more... Wait, hold on, no, no, no.
[124:44.18]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[124:45.64]Isn't it longer than that?
[124:47.96]It's not jewelry, right?
[124:49.50]Isn't it... Is it jewelry?
[124:51.75]Jewelry?
[124:56.89]That motherfucker gave me the answer, and I fucking didn't.
[125:06.16]I thought he was- I thought it was like jewelry.
[125:23.57]I think you know the letter.
[125:24.61]I'm going to ask you to go ahead and pick three more consonants and a vowel.
[125:32.08]Hey, hey, wait a minute.
[125:34.86]They're all feeding answers to people in the sub-Discord.
[125:39.48]We've got a controversy here we have to handle.
[125:42.01]We've got a controversy that we need to deal with here.
[125:46.39]Time is short, so get ready to solve.
[125:50.13]We've got a controversy.
[125:53.21]I can't believe he gave me the answer.
[125:54.48]I honestly thought that... Oh my god.
[125:57.42]You know what's... I have no excuse, but I thought you were fucking with me or something.
[126:00.68]I thought it was just like, oh, fashion and jewelry designer.
[126:04.50]This is a controversy.
[126:05.14]They've been feeding them answers in the sub-Discord.
[126:07.24]Controversy alert.
[126:12.75]I'm not done.
[126:13.37]I'm literally doing one more and I'm fucking out of here.
[126:15.09]I don't care what happens.
[126:27.38]See, what you should have done is you should have wrote answer and then delete it and then write it.
[126:38.53]Jewelry.
[126:39.53]Jewelry.
[126:40.37]It just doesn't look right.
[126:41.73]Hold on.
[126:41.89]I can write this out.
[126:42.37]Jewelry?
[126:42.55]Jewelry?
[126:58.08]It doesn't look right.
[126:59.50]I thought, like, jewelry.
[127:01.31]Jewelry.
[127:03.65]Whatever.
[127:17.50]Jewelry is traditional British.
[127:19.84]I swear to God, right?
[127:20.70]I thought it was, like, jewelry.
[127:24.72]Jewelry.
[127:27.32]They're not like Jewelry.
[127:29.70]Right?
[127:31.28]That's not an inaccurate way to spell it.
[127:33.48]It's like with two L's, right?
[127:41.21]Jewelry is a... Jewelry is correct.
[127:45.97]Jewelry is some... It's American and British English.
[127:48.28]Hold on.
[127:49.90]I want to look this up.
[127:50.90]Jewelry.
[127:51.36]Jewelry or jewelry?
[127:52.98]Jewelry.
[128:13.27]Jewelry is the American English, and jewelry is the British English.
[128:16.48]Oh, the British fucking English is the correct one.
[128:30.20]I thought there was more letters.
[128:31.88]Unde...
[128:46.66]So, yeah, I had it right.
[128:48.38]It's just another way to spell it.
[128:53.59]What is a food and drink?
[128:57.05]Alright, come on.
[128:58.43]Jeremy, you suck.
[129:00.49]These names are killing me.
[129:04.47]Alright, come on.
[129:16.64]I don't think you're going to be able to... I don't think you know... Yeah, what's the British way to spell this part?
[129:26.61]Wait, what do you... Wait, hold on.
[129:33.08]Wait, I'm going to get it wrong.
[129:34.24]What?
[129:34.48]I pressed the button.

[133:17.44]I don't care.
[133:21.66]Why did that- I'm sounding like an explosion.
[133:35.07]I was ignoring answers in chat to be fair, but people were blowing up my DMs with answers.
[133:48.75]I'm blowing up my DM answers.
[133:50.39]What was it?

[137:08.81]It's like a scent.
[137:10.23]It's not even a flavor.
[137:11.05]It's like I can smell them in my mouth.
[137:13.53]Does that make any sense?
[137:14.18]No, no, I don't want to do that.
[137:24.60]Barbecue chips smell like coffee breath.

[143:00.99]Stop saying last.
[143:01.53]This is the last one, no matter what.
[143:03.96]This is the final one, no matter what.
[143:08.60]If I don't leave, I'll just hit end stream.

[144:08.98]Yeah, I should have been like a boxer.
[144:12.30]I wouldn't get touched once.
[144:14.45]I wouldn't get hit by one punch.
[144:17.45]It would be like... I wouldn't get it one time.
[144:22.36]Not once.
[144:22.66]Batch of warm cookies.
[144:23.94]If I was in the medieval times, and we were in a battle, I wouldn't get hit once.
[144:58.16]Somebody said, you're hallucinating.
[145:06.98]Dude, fuck off.
[145:08.14]You would have died of the plague.
[145:11.44]Not of a punch in the face or an axe to the head.
[145:21.65]Yeah, I would have eaten the old sandwich on the ground and died from the plague.
[145:27.66]That would be etched on my gravestone.
[145:29.96]But on my gravestone it would say, here lies Sir Jeremy Elbertson, the Swift.
[145:33.81]And it would say, it would have my record on it.
[145:36.45]It would be like 500 and 0.
[145:38.55]500 and 0.
[145:38.85]Dash 0.
[145:59.36]What are you doing?
[145:59.92]It looks like you're ready to solve contestant number three.
[146:18.26]Jerma, you danced on stream once and had to take a month off.
[146:21.26]No, I danced on stream and realized how bad my condition was, so then I decided to take a month off.
[146:26.95]I could dance right now and be fine.
[146:28.55]No, I'm not going to do that.
[146:30.70]There was no axe involved.
[146:31.94]There was no battle axe.
[146:33.47]There was no sword, no broadsword, no bastard sword.
[146:38.01]Dude, I'm gonna go to like a... I'm gonna go to like a LARPing event thing or like a martial artist place and go there and be like, come get me.
[146:47.38]And just dodge everything.
[146:50.02]Is this gonna end up like... Didn't Steven Seagal do this?
[146:55.17]He was like pushing people over.
[146:59.71]How fucking funny would it be, though, if I, like, got a real professional martial artist facility to humor me, and they just beat the shit out of me.
[147:10.27]I was like, alright, let's go!
[147:13.35]And it was just like, ow, ow!
[147:15.17]And I was like, stop, stop, I'm sorry!
[147:17.09]And that was the whole stream, and I turned it off.
[147:23.99]I'm not messing around.
[147:30.56]Okay.
[147:33.12]You're not messing around.
[147:39.35]I love how this person is communicating with us.
[147:45.11]I'm not messing around.
[147:46.17]Smile.
[147:48.00]Okay.
[147:51.52]There you go.
[147:54.06]There you go.
[147:59.67]Why am I smiling like an alien?
[148:01.89]What if he heard what a smile was?
[148:05.31]No, what am I doing?
[148:06.04]I'm an alien.
[148:10.10]Oh, it's my turn.
[148:34.50]That's a fair bit of cash 500
[149:10.92]Oh, alright.
[149:12.46]You're good.
[149:14.29]700.
[149:18.23]We have one R. Good job.
[149:20.95]Keep that going, and you'll be heading home a winner tonight.
[149:39.07]Pretty good.
[149:39.93]I love all the people dancing over here.
[149:46.90]Is it the music?
[149:55.08]Are you dancing to the music?
[150:11.25]This is a fun stream.
[150:12.05]I played three games today.
[150:15.48]I usually don't do that.
[150:16.42]Maybe one or two.
[150:17.44]I usually don't do three.
[150:19.56]This is fun.

[155:10.13]This is the best controller, by the way.
[155:12.65]The Switch Pro controller.
[155:14.99]Just kidding.
[155:17.55]It's not bad.
[155:23.48]It's not bad.
[155:24.78]The buttons could be a little better.
[155:31.58]I like the analogs, though.
[155:32.67]I like the mouthfeel.

[156:48.29]I don't think you win, though.
[156:49.29]That's gonna be close.
[157:05.88]Making my shopping list.
[157:08.18]Will you win the game if you do this?
[157:10.62]If you do, that's gonna be funny.
[157:13.18]You only have two seconds, though.
[157:16.47]Nope.
[157:17.73]I would have won anyways.
[157:30.74]Finally, I win.
[157:32.20]All it took was somebody in chat to lose in front of me.
[157:34.82]Alright, let's take this to the bonus round.
[157:42.12]That's it.
[157:43.86]Thanks for playing, guys.
[157:44.58]Good job.

[160:30.49]I'll see you guys later.
[160:31.93]Thanks for watching.
[160:33.15]We went a little late, but I did start a little late, so that's fine.
[160:38.31]Really appreciate everyone sticking around.
[160:41.61]We did a lot of random stuff today.
[160:45.16]So the plan, I've got a lot of stuff going on this weekend.
[160:51.17]You probably will see me.
[160:52.55]You might see me at some point this weekend, but you will absolutely see me Monday or Tuesday.
[161:01.61]There's a lot of stuff for baseball that I have to get done.
[161:04.94]So I need to take some more time.
[161:09.42]I think you'll probably see me on like Saturday.
[161:12.52]I'm going to try to stream Saturday.
[161:19.70]Thanks for sticking around.
[161:20.77]Always fun.
[161:26.15]Games were interesting too.
[161:27.49]That first one was pretty fun.
[161:29.65]Second one was pretty fun.
[161:31.47]Third one, eh.
[161:35.51]I would like to see the rules change in Wheel of Fortune.
[161:41.86]But no, thanks for watching guys.
[161:46.86]Here's your outro music.
[162:13.53]Bring back the camera.
[162:15.99]This is the outro.
[162:19.75]You know what?
[162:20.29]We'll probably... I know I keep putting it off, but I just don't feel like getting scared.
[162:25.48]The next time I stream, hold me to this.
[162:27.66]We're going to do some of the DreadX stuff.
[162:39.99]Put it in the sus so I can't change it.
[162:53.65]There's still unpaid debt.
[162:55.01]Yeah, there is.
[162:56.71]A lot of it.
[163:01.87]What's DreadX?
[163:02.69]It's kind of like a jackbox party pack of horror games.
[163:07.46]They've made about five or six of them, right?
[163:21.32]I'm looking forward to it.
[163:25.30]Alright, guys.
[163:25.98]See you later.
[163:26.44]Thanks for watching.
[163:27.08]Good night.
[163:27.52]Goodbye.
[163:28.14]See you maybe on Saturday.
[163:30.77]If not, then absolutely on Monday or Tuesday.
[163:33.25]And I'm very excited.
[163:35.45]I cannot wait for this baseball stream.
[163:37.73]It's going to be so much fun.
