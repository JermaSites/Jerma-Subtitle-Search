[00:01.85]This thing doesn't even look like it's on.
[00:03.83]I don't even get it.
[00:04.69]I hate this thing.
[00:07.11]Oh, it's blinking now.
[00:10.79]Hello, people of the Internet.
[00:13.47]It is I, Sergeant Benadine Binkleton, the sergeant of the Salty Swamp Police Department.
[00:20.58]Yes, I'm very important.
[00:23.30]This is my first video blog.
[00:25.12]I...
[00:26.10]I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm sure as time goes along, I will know exactly how to work this webcam that took me three hours to set up.
[00:36.63]And I don't even know if it's recording right now, but I hope it is.
[00:40.25]Anywho, get ready for Salty Swamp 2.
[00:42.70]It's coming out fairly soon.
[00:44.78]Will you two just shut the fuck up?
[00:47.58]Alright?
[00:48.98]I'm sitting here trying to do a video blog for the people on the Internet that love me.
[00:53.66]That's right.
[00:54.30]I'm loved.
[00:55.49]You nigger YouTube.
[00:57.05]That thing's still blinking, you know, right?
[00:59.33]Um, okay.
[01:02.67]Stay tuned.
