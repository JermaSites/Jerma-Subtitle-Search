[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.49]Okay, got a little bit of a drink.
[00:05.85]Let's see, what should we do here for the next like hour?
[00:08.75]Let me take a look.
[00:13.31]I have... We could go back to Vampire the Masquerade for a little bit.
[00:30.22]A comb stream.
[00:34.76]Did I complete Phantasmagoria?
[00:36.20]I did not complete Phantasmagoria.
[00:39.24]Though, I'm not sure I would like to.
[00:47.16]Alcohol.
[00:47.64]No, it's an orange juice.
[00:49.30]It's just an orange juice.
[00:57.81]Let's see.
[01:03.23]I guess I could do...
[01:08.24]I guess I could just play The Masquerade for a little bit.
[01:11.72]Might as well.
[01:12.10]I feel like there's a little more that I'd want to see there.
[01:16.01]If only I played for like an hour.
[01:20.39]Team Fortress 2?
[01:22.59]I mean... I feel like we got started with Vampire The Masquerade and we just... I like abandoned it after one stream.
[01:35.57]So let's do that.
[01:39.49]Hmm no no comb stream not tonight Let's change this Vampire the masquerade bloodlines.
[02:00.14]Oh
[02:08.82]Yeah, I don't really want to play TF2 right now.
[02:13.96]I'm just not really into it at the moment.
[02:17.52]I don't know if I ever will be.
[02:22.13]Let me open it.
[02:22.99]Hold on.
[02:33.37]Careful of your ears.
[02:34.36]It might be loud.
[02:35.32]I hope it's not.
[02:36.80]It's not that bad.
[02:41.46]All right, now let me just make it so it is correct.
[02:52.29]And did it work?
[02:56.53]It did.
[02:56.81]All right.
[03:04.32]Vampire the Masquerade.
[03:06.14]Let's play this for a little bit.
[03:08.05]The last thing I did... I don't... I think I was like... I was... What the hell was I doing?
[03:11.31]Let's try to remember here.
[03:13.09]Let's go... I don't... I remember I had to save it somewhere else.
[03:19.05]Because it was not good.
[03:20.15]I think we're gonna go to this one.
[03:27.93]Yeah, I... Look, I... Everyone that's like, Oh, what about TF2?
[03:30.65]TF2?
[03:31.15]TF2?
[03:32.47]The way that I see it is this, right?
[03:33.72]Like...
[03:36.71]When you play a game, or you do something for long enough... You know, I enjoyed my time in it.
[03:43.72]I think it's one of my favorite games ever made.
[03:46.28]That's absolute.
[03:49.10]It's absolutely one of the best games ever made.
[03:53.04]It's in my top five for sure.
[03:55.78]But just because something's, like, one of your favorite games that's ever been made, like, doesn't... Like, Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games ever made.
[04:02.84]But I kind of did it.
[04:04.18]I got overplayed it.
[04:07.17]And, like, I don't play Chrono Trigger every day.
[04:09.45]You know what I mean?
[04:11.85]That doesn't mean that I don't respect it wholeheartedly.
[04:16.53]I have, like, nothing bad to say about that game.
[04:18.81]I might have something bad to say about how Valve handled that game.
[04:24.27]in recent last few years but you know it's just the way it is so where are we going is the question here now and how do what are the buttons because I already don't know them I think it's okay so the doc is being stalked by an asian vampire now what about downtown investigate the elizabeth dane but before you do he wants you to contact nines rodriguez at the bar called the last round let's go downtown
[04:58.24]Come here, you.
[05:00.54]Is it F?
[05:01.46]No, F is bite, guy.
[05:02.38]I forgot.
[05:02.88]F is bite.
[05:03.50]It's in.
[05:05.34]Rip it.
[05:05.56]Let's go.
[05:06.38]Downtown.
[05:10.60]But that doesn't mean I'm never gonna play TF2 ever again.
[05:13.06]I don't know.
[05:15.17]I can't tell you guys that, guys, in one year, I'm gonna wanna play TF2 again.
[05:20.59]Sometimes you just get an urge to wanna do it.
[05:22.19]Like, I've done it before.
[05:22.97]I've had, like, the urge to jump in and play for a couple hours.
[05:27.34]But I'm not, I don't want to like, I also don't want to like hold like a string out, like a candle, a candle, a carrot on a stick and be like, I might play it someday, that's why.
[05:35.97]Like, no.
[05:38.81]I, I just, I just, at this point, I kind of just do whatever I think is fun at the time.
[05:47.74]Just a gun on the ground.
[05:49.82]Okay, well, somebody dropped a gun.
[05:51.24]Alright, where's the bar?
[05:52.76]Looking for a bar.
[06:00.16]Start the timer.
[06:02.68]Lots of people just dropping guns and knives.
[06:08.47]Hotel.
[06:15.53]I'm looking for the bar.
[06:16.41]Is this the bar?
[06:19.19]This looks like a bar.
[06:20.57]The last round, it is a bar.
[06:23.19]Let me in.
[06:29.87]This is my kind of bar.
[06:33.53]Uh, what's the quicksave again?
[06:38.85]Quicksave is... F9 and F12.
[06:41.95]Okay.
[06:43.17]You got it.
[06:48.57]Quicksave.
[06:49.15]Okay.
[06:49.84]I need to play the pinball machine first, because that's the most important thing.
[06:56.16]Who are you?
[06:58.92]You are the damsel of distress, yes?
[07:00.96]I'm dangerous.
[07:02.16]Someone talking shit about me over in that ivory tower?
[07:04.84]Who said it, huh?
[07:06.08]I'll kick their ass.
[07:10.19]Listen to this music.
[07:12.91]The only words spoken were in my head.
[07:14.79]Kicking them in the head would be more effective.
[07:17.09]Lunatic.
[07:17.99]I give you a piece of my mind, seeing as how you're just another D-boy for the Camarilla.
[07:22.89]Shit.
[07:23.69]No amount of good sense penetrates that white noise in your mouth's color brain, does it?
[07:29.73]Something is plaguing you.
[07:32.37]You just want my opinion on the new update because it's interesting.
[07:42.41]I'm just glad they're actually doing it.
[07:45.85]It took them a long time to get it out there, but... Look, Team Fortress 2 is... Is like, fucking... Like, ten years old.
[07:55.17]It is so old.
[07:57.55]I can't think of any other video game that is nearly a decade old, more than that, that is still being played and updated by the developers that originally made it.
[08:15.20]That's a long fucking time.
[08:20.94]World of Warcraft?
[08:23.14]But World of Warcraft is like a... You have to pay to play.
[08:27.22]Wow.
[08:28.65]TF2 is not a subscription-based game.
[08:30.85]You just play it.
[08:32.43]It's a first-person shooter.
[08:34.31]It's a multiplayer first-person shooter.
[08:36.13]It's not a... It's not like a fucking subscription-based video game.
[08:42.31]Uh, shoo the pigeon away.
[08:43.13]See an old yeller?
[08:44.69]May sound cruel, but it's necessary.
[08:46.43]If someone puts together two and two as to the real cause of an outbreak of bloodborne diseases, guess what happens?
[08:52.80]So the plague bearer's gotta be found and put down.
[08:55.44]If the Camarilla really gives a damn, they'll help us out.
[08:59.45]My neck owes a debt to the Anarchs.
[09:01.09]What shall I do?
[09:01.91]I'm gonna go find somebody in the apartments.
[09:04.13]Okay, I will fuck that guy up.
[09:05.12]Okay, so go talk to homeless people?
[09:26.50]I will spread my mind around the city of angels.
[09:28.96]See you, damn, damn sail.
[09:34.28]So, what about... Okay, so I still have to find Nines Rodriguez.
[09:42.06]What are you guys, Nines Rodriguez?
[09:47.44]You don't look like Nines Rodriguez.
[09:50.91]Up the stairs.
[09:51.45]Nines?
[09:52.01]Rodriguez?
[09:53.31]Is that you?
[09:53.73]Oh, the jester plays his little games and sends his little birds.
[09:56.93]Yes, I am.
[09:57.31]Yes, I am.
[10:21.06]The music is just overpowering.
[10:22.69]Greetings Helter Skelter.
[10:25.47]I seek the name of the numbers.
[10:26.71]Man, I hate talking to you guys.
[10:28.41]Nines.
[10:29.25]Name with numbers.
[10:30.71]Nines Rodriguez, right?
[10:32.47]He's upstairs.
[10:33.74]More.
[10:34.00]Watch yourself.
[10:35.18]We don't take kindly to Camarilla spies around here.
[10:37.52]Okay.
[10:39.04]You're a two-headed dog on the shores of a poisoned sea.
[10:41.44]Farewell.
[10:43.42]We'll go by.
[10:44.94]They're gonna go even more up the stairs.
[10:46.70]You showed up.
[10:47.96]Good.
[10:48.70]Here's what I gotta tell you.
[10:49.74]Is it him?
[10:50.06]So you know, I don't lecture, I don't rap, I'm no bureaucrat.
[10:53.58]I'm just a guy out of nowhere came to be involved in something 500 times bigger than you and me.
[10:59.06]More!
[10:59.56]Yeah, this guy does have a much better face texture.
[11:02.72]He was animated more than everybody else.
[11:04.40]So what happens if I kill this guy?
[11:06.10]Can I?
[11:28.51]Multilevel marketing.
[11:28.99]Just get your friends and family to sign up for this shake company.
[11:32.03]This natural energy drink.
[11:55.63]them spying which is
[12:10.05]uh-huh uh let me hear your truth the way of this world during the depression a bunch of old rich bastards screwed the country but did they suffer no the little people suffered you can't trust me rob zombie the world would be a better place without them all you can do is get a group of people together who aren't find a place to put your feet up and make some examples of the quote unquote elite to keep the rest the hell out of the elite everyone's an equal here the same thing this country used to be about
[12:37.63]He's talking about the Washington elites.
[12:44.14]The Camarilla was kicked out on their ass a long time ago.
[12:47.30]We, the Anarchs, didn't want to play their politics anymore.
[12:49.92]Now LaCroix and LaCroix cop in like they never left?
[12:52.32]Uh-uh.
[12:53.02]No goddamn way.
[12:54.40]Their lies don't apply to us.
[12:56.22]I'm going to join these guys.
[12:59.12]Meet with them baloney all around.
[13:00.78]You and the Prince don't golf on the weekends.
[13:02.91]LaCroix represents everything I hate.
[13:04.81]The Camarilla, stuck-up aristocrats, rich businessmen, crooked politicians.
[13:09.71]The only place LaCroix belongs is in an urn.
[13:12.65]Oh, wow.
[13:17.46]I got them waiting right here.
[13:18.82]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[13:19.61]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[13:20.67]I pressed 1 and he pulled out a gun.
[13:23.17]Are you the prince of thieves and are these your merry men?
[13:26.41]Isn't this where your theme music kicks in?
[13:29.11]Stereotype.
[13:30.05]Oh, shit.
[13:30.65]Oh, whoops.
[13:31.29]That's perfect.
[13:47.92]Time can also be spent.
[13:49.12]And I have overpaid tonight.
[13:50.32]I am gone.
[13:51.50]Hee hee hee.
[13:55.04]Perfect.
[13:57.18]Wait, did I miss?
[13:57.90]Did I fuck up the quest?
[14:02.04]Okay, I gotta go back and report to the prince.
[14:03.92]Thought I told you to get back to your tower.
[14:06.24]Run along.
[14:07.15]I think LaCroix's shoes need polishing.
[14:09.05]Uh oh-oh, here he is.
[14:13.25]With Finn and Jake and lots of time and Venture and a lot of friends.
[14:17.84]Here he comes to say goodbye until this never ends.
[14:22.44]Where are you headed now?
[14:23.50]Venture time!
[14:24.34]Okay, then why are you here then?
[14:29.09]Bye.
[14:36.83]That song sucks, by the way.
[14:44.66]Adventure Time's cool, but I fucking hate that song.
[14:54.01]What are you trying to accomplish with that song?
[15:00.99]It's nuts.
[15:04.61]Let's go back to the tower.
[15:09.86]I'm supposed to talk to the homeless people, right?
[15:15.30]I don't think this guy's homeless.
[15:20.02]No, I'm just kidding.
[15:20.82]It's funny.
[15:21.36]It's Pendleton Ward playing on a ukulele.
[15:24.17]And he's like the weird guy that made that show.
[15:26.25]And that's what's like... It's self-referential, right?
[15:30.23]I don't know.
[15:30.69]I've only seen one half of one episode.
[15:34.80]And.
[15:40.52]I thought it was CatDog when I first saw it.
[15:46.93]Yeah, let's go upstairs.
[15:59.26]Come on, what?
[16:03.92]Do I have to like get checked in again?
[16:10.49]Yeah, you go right on up and see Mr. LaCroix.
[16:14.50]Cover me, Tubbs!
[16:18.32]Must have dozed after a minute.
[16:19.78]Okay.
[16:25.38]Why can I not go up?
[16:28.20]Oh, there we go.
[16:33.79]Adventure time.
[16:35.89]Give the Anarch community my regards.
[16:39.41]Sorry about the sapphires.
[16:41.35]Sorry.
[16:43.14]Done.
[16:43.46]Blah, blah.
[16:44.04]Woof, woof.
[16:44.44]If I may give you a piece of advice, always listen to others' words carefully.
[16:50.28]Read between the lines.
[16:51.79]Gauge where you stand with them and who they decry or exalt.
[16:56.61]The more you know about someone,
[16:58.90]It's time to go to fight the Great Dane.
[17:05.64]First, I wish something from your head.
[17:06.66]I'm always ready to be already gone.
[17:09.24]Yes.
[17:09.48]So that means... I am going to open it.
[17:11.81]That's just how it works.
[17:30.36]Santa Monica.
[17:32.24]Go to the beach in Santa Monica where the boat will be waiting to take you to the ship.
[17:36.42]Let's do it.
[17:38.56]That's the first chance I get.
[17:40.10]I'm mashing E to open that.
[17:46.73]Look in the fridge.
[17:54.65]Yes, I am.
[17:56.89]Back to Santa Monica.
[18:00.72]Never trust a Malkavian with sensitive info.
[18:04.48]I gotta get to the beach.
[18:07.06]Beach access.
[18:08.06]Ooh, don't swing a knife in public.
[18:09.98]That's something you don't want to do.
[18:11.06]You're gonna get in trouble.
[18:17.37]Well, I was doing melee, right?
[18:19.99]From what I remember.
[18:27.73]Fun will never end.
[18:41.69]Uh, I'm not allowed to kill anybody on this mission, really?
[18:46.87]Well, I have points in, uh, obfuscate, so I'll be okay.
[18:50.81]There's the boat.
[18:52.82]Let's get in.
[18:55.90]How does one get in boat?
[19:00.82]Like that.
[19:01.74]You just jump in.
[19:02.40]Okay, quick save.
[19:09.39]So I can't kill anybody on the dame.
[19:14.04]Why not?
[19:14.36]Am I... So am I not allowed to be here?
[19:25.55]Tell Jacobson if he plans on making editor-in-chief, he's gotta start working with me.
[19:30.85]I can't keep getting him these scoops if he's gonna send high school journalists who don't know enough to wear something that would blend in.
[19:39.55]See in me a vision of Jacobson's corrupt crony.
[19:43.31]Take it easy, Flash.
[19:45.01]This is still a badge you're talking to.
[19:48.08]Didn't work.
[19:50.46]Where are our hands in this business?
[19:51.80]All right, look.
[19:52.92]I got you a copy of the initial report, and I can get you into the cabin, but you gotta make yourself real scared after that.
[19:58.52]Jerry Seinfeld.
[19:59.62]Anybody catches you, I don't know you.
[20:01.97]And no goddamn Flash photography brainchild.
[20:03.99]Oh, shit.
[20:06.68]Oh, no.
[20:07.80]This is a stealth mission.
[20:08.96]He's speaking into his hand.
[20:10.98]Okay.
[20:12.77]Kramer's going to open up the back door.
[20:13.93]Hey, Jerry.
[20:15.03]Can't believe it.
[20:15.93]I fell down the stairs.
[20:17.29]A vampire was in the hallway, and I just stooped out of there.
[20:38.12]I get it.
[20:38.42]Double... I think I remember.
[20:39.46]Double the fee, huh?
[20:39.88]Well...
[21:06.20]You sure?
[21:07.24]I'll give you double the fee.
[21:08.52]Double the delish.
[21:18.41]Fuck off.
[21:19.85]Doesn't seem to mind.
[21:21.33]Alright, wasn't he supposed to get me somewhere?
[21:23.81]Is it...
[21:38.52]I thought the police were on my side here.
[21:40.84]Now he's shooting at me.
[21:43.55]What?
[21:47.21]I don't understand.
[21:49.67]Why?
[21:49.97]I just bit... He didn't even know.
[22:01.46]He didn't even know I bit him.
[22:02.94]Fine, I won't bite him.
[22:04.47]And I'll sneak.
[22:08.18]All right, let's sneak here.
[22:11.28]Oh, I can get you inside of there, buddy.
[22:17.41]Yeah, I can get you inside of there.
[22:23.63]How do I turn this shit off again?
[22:26.11]N, okay.
[22:26.49]All right, we're sneaking.
[22:36.91]What is the actual... I have to get a box and grab it and look at it, right?
[22:48.78]Do I have enough lockpicking?
[22:52.86]Below a difficulty of three.
[22:55.79]Can I just get in there?
[23:01.43]What have I got?
[23:02.71]Dexterity.
[23:05.07]What increases my luck picking?
[23:09.29]Melee.
[23:11.75]Wait, what?
[23:13.11]Security.
[23:13.73]Okay.
[23:16.05]I'm going to put a point into security.
[23:17.07]I'm going to put two points into security.
[23:24.86]Done deal.
[23:25.62]Let's get it open.
[23:35.78]Save it here.
[23:36.22]It's got a bigger skill tree than Path of Exile.
[23:41.80]Records room.
[23:43.76]Another.
[23:46.51]Lock to pick.
[23:49.79]Below six.
[23:50.77]I could buff myself, but I'm going to end up dying.
[23:53.57]Let's just do it.
[23:56.63]I'm going to go crazy.
[23:57.47]Alright, what is this?

[25:09.72]90 people, 100 people?
[25:11.20]I'm kidding.
[25:15.82]He heard me.
[25:22.32]That guy heard me do that.
[25:28.20]How would you hear me?
[25:29.36]What is with this?
[25:30.00]Come on.
[25:42.21]Come here, please.
[25:50.25]He doesn't know where that was.
[25:51.01]He didn't know where that came from.
[25:51.93]I can climb this, can't I?
[25:53.13]Of course I can.
[25:54.91]Alright.
[25:55.23]I can OB here.
[25:55.71]I'm going to OB up here, I think.
[26:08.37]Can I keep going?
[26:08.97]Okay, I just, like, alt-tabbed the game somehow.
[26:14.34]What the hell happened?
[26:19.02]What?
[26:19.20]Fucking Windows key.
[26:24.25]I swear to God.
[26:29.03]Dude, will there ever be a use for the Windows key?
[26:45.16]They're like having a... Oh, Jesus.
[26:49.44]Fucking stealth mission.
[26:51.36]Oh, god damn it.
[27:02.11]There's so many people here.
[27:05.13]Grab the manifesto.
[27:06.67]Did I get it?
[27:09.85]Oh, fuck.
[27:16.34]Can the officer over there see me?
[27:19.85]What the fuck, man?
[27:21.35]What?
[27:22.79]Why?
[27:23.92]What?
[27:28.30]What is the point of... Oh, my God.
[27:41.65]He can see me, yeah.
[27:42.89]He can see the guy behind him.
[27:44.24]I pressed F so he turned around and shot me.
[27:53.72]Save it here.
[27:54.20]I can just remove it.
[28:02.59]I really should just pull it off.
[28:07.03]I don't even know if I picked that up.
[28:08.45]Okay, let's try this again.
[28:15.11]Fucking God.
[28:17.09]If I'm close enough for an execute, I'm apparently not close enough to bite him.
[28:29.92]I'm close enough to get an execute prompt, but not close enough to bite the fucking guy.
[28:49.81]Jesus Christ.
[28:59.60]Out of the way.
[29:04.62]Moon Gamer.
[29:05.30]No, I got an execute prompt.
[29:07.02]That means you're close enough to do some damage.
[29:12.07]Don't fucking do that.
[29:14.47]F5.
[29:14.87]No, F5 is not the right key.
[29:22.67]I can't imagine how the hell I would do something like this without obfuscate.
[29:29.47]I got one EXP.
[29:30.42]I explored the crime scene.
[29:33.74]Quest log has been updated.
[29:34.74]I better get to a spot where I'm not going to get seen.
[29:36.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[29:37.84]It's all right.
[29:39.70]Just keep it up.
[29:43.22]That's the sarcophagus right there.
[29:47.46]Let's just open it.
[29:53.66]You have successfully completed your task about the Elizabeth Dane report back to the prince.
[30:00.11]We're going to open the box, right?
[30:07.36]What happens if I do this?
[30:12.08]Can I not open it?
[30:26.27]Alright, box can't be opened.
[30:35.40]Good to know.
[30:37.40]I completed the mission.
[30:42.90]So now I'm just gonna get out of here.
[30:43.90]I have to like go all the way back?
[30:46.42]Ay yi yi.
[30:52.21]Can that guy smell me?
[30:56.22]Oh, shit.
[30:59.23]I'm just going to have to reload it again.
[31:00.79]What a waste of blood that was.
[31:02.21]I could have just went this way.
[31:03.23]It's permanently invisible.
[31:15.90]This is such cheating.
[31:25.52]I feel like I'm playing Metal Gear Solid.
[31:28.10]Remember in Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2, you'd just be permanently invisible walking around?
[31:35.57]That's so funny.
[31:39.27]It was a bandana?
[31:42.49]Or... the stealth suit.
[31:44.46]And why would you ever want the bandana?
[31:51.49]Bandana was useless.
[31:53.27]It gave you infinite ammo.
[31:54.41]Oh, well, that's cool when you can permanently walk through the whole game and not be seen once.
[31:57.95]Okay, I'm going to fuck this up.
[32:05.32]Just want to make sure you guys are aware of this.
[32:06.62]I'm going to screw this up.
[32:09.00]No, I'm good.
[32:19.73]Alright!
[32:21.21]Victory!
[32:21.69]Get out of the way!
[32:34.17]And this should take us back here.
[32:38.53]What happened?
[32:41.68]What is going on?
[32:43.04]Is there a guy out there that's shopping?
[32:44.42]Okay, well, whatever.
[32:57.09]I'm gonna blame this on how fucking sloppy the doors are in this game.
[33:05.13]I wanna, like, open a door and it's like... That door can't even be opened.
[33:24.04]Where the hell am I going?
[33:33.18]Take this.
[33:33.56]What is this?
[33:33.87]What am I taking?
[33:38.19]Oh.
[33:39.75]That was a loud sound.
[33:45.87]Oh, God.
[33:46.89]It's just fucking open.
[33:48.90]For Christ's sake.
[33:54.06]Okay, there's a guy down here.
[33:55.20]Save it here.
[33:59.46]I gotta go out this way.
[34:00.70]Bad guy right outside the door.
[34:04.33]Get it on that computer.
[34:05.15]Okay.
[34:14.68]Where is the computer?
[34:15.36]Okay, I thought there was a... I just freaked out.
[34:18.84]I thought there was a guy in here.
[34:19.64]I'm using all this blood for no reason, too.
[34:22.70]Okay, uh... Control.
[34:31.41]Hack it.
[34:34.18]I don't have a good enough hacking skill.
[34:37.30]See, I'm gonna leave the boat.
[34:38.46]This mission was dumb.
[34:39.30]I hate this mission.
[34:43.87]This mission is stupid.
[34:46.47]Go sneak and walk up to a sarcophagus and then sneak out.
[34:49.97]No, not fun.
[34:51.45]The haunted house was awesome.
[34:52.92]The other mission, the split personality girl was awesome.
[34:55.96]This is dumb.
[35:01.62]What?
[35:02.04]How would you even know what I was... What?
[35:03.60]Why are they investigating this?
[35:13.54]What?
[35:14.02]What?
[35:14.48]Why am I stuck?
[35:16.21]What?
[35:17.95]Why?
[35:18.83]What?
[35:19.93]Why?
[35:20.31]Why?
[35:21.53]Why?
[35:25.73]Why?
[35:26.37]God!
[35:29.83]I touched him.
[35:30.73]It was like six feet between me and the wall.
[35:32.99]Get out of the fucking way.
[35:40.12]Get out of the way.
[35:45.72]You tell me I bumped into this guy.
[35:48.20]Look at how much space there is.
[35:49.38]I could move a dresser draw through this.
[35:51.68]I could move a draw through here.
[36:09.78]I didn't kill him!
[36:10.78]I didn't kill him.
[36:13.16]I didn't kill him.
[36:14.56]Is that gonna be bad?
[36:15.20]You said don't kill anybody on this mission, but what if I don't kill him?
[36:31.65]Wait, isn't this the... This is my friend, right?
[36:35.81]I thought this was the guy that I was, like, working with.
[36:38.09]Is that why you can't kill anybody?
[36:39.71]Is that the reason why?
[36:41.60]The password's a lighthouse on the computer.
[36:44.16]But you guys are just giving me the answer.
[36:48.08]I would not have known that was the answer.
[36:49.66]You guys are all giving me the answer.
[36:51.66]How do you not understand this?
[36:55.08]Let me just type in the fucking free answer.
[37:04.16]The cop, no he didn't, the cop didn't tell me shit.
[37:11.24]All right, I'm happy again.
[37:12.70]What else we got?
[37:15.39]I'm just driving this around.
[37:25.21]All ball kids are open.
[37:30.07]Alright, we're moving and I get to go in the police car and press the button.
[37:34.19]And sound the horn.
[37:37.78]Alright, that was fun.
[37:42.56]What was my free experience?
[37:48.58]Let's see what the weather's going to be like.
[37:51.85]Not bad.
[38:00.18]Oh, I don't have this password.
[38:15.32]I loved this game until this part.
[38:17.24]Like, this was like, I loved this game until this stupid fucking dumb stealth sneak shithole mission.
[38:29.01]What's going on here?
[38:34.17]And now I can't go anywhere.
[38:35.56]I can't sneak by this guy, apparently.
[38:37.60]If this touches him, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[38:41.24]That touched him.
[38:43.24]Of course it did.
[38:50.68]So, if I can't sneak by that guy, should I just go the other way?
[39:02.56]Where's my scream?
[39:09.22]I'm gonna have to, like, make this guy go crazy or something.
[39:11.54]Uh, let's go with... Hysteria.
[39:19.99]I still touched him though.
[39:27.69]Okay, uh... Do something weird!
[39:32.29]Run away!
[39:34.79]He's not gonna move.
[39:45.22]It's like right there.
[39:46.21]Why do I have... Punch him and run away?
[39:49.27]I can't, can I?
[39:58.19]What if I give him, like, hallucinations?
[40:00.59]Okay, there.
[40:01.13]Maybe he'll run over there now.
[40:07.01]Does he... Does it matter?
[40:07.79]I guess it doesn't matter.
[40:09.19]If you touch anyone.
[40:10.85]I'll get to go around.
[40:13.79]I'm running out of blood.
[40:15.33]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[40:40.30]No!
[40:45.75]Just get me the fuck out of here!
[40:47.31]Just get me out of here, please!
[40:56.37]Get in the fucking door!
[41:02.53]Alright.
[41:04.71]Now, turn this off.
[41:11.04]I don't even know where the fuck I'm even supposed to go.
[41:15.10]To like, feed on him, make him- I fed on him and he just started shooting me.
[41:25.15]I don't know, I don't think there's a guy behind here.
[41:28.67]Or there might be.
[41:30.85]Where does this even lead?
[41:31.73]I have no idea.
[41:32.37]This is bad.
[41:37.56]Okay, this is the correct way.
[41:48.02]So now, where the hell am I supposed to go?
[41:51.59]Do I just talk to this guy again?
[41:55.75]Is this guy going to shoot me now?
[41:57.09]Or what?
[42:00.57]You waiting for your chauffeur to pull around the dinghy?
[42:05.52]Bless you.
[42:06.02]Do I have to jump off into that?
[42:12.78]Alright, let's get in there.
[42:26.43]Speedrun.
[42:29.01]Oh boy, I fucking hated that.
[42:50.40]Ah.
[42:55.07]That was just like, it's just some stealth, like stealth dog shit.
[42:59.07]I hate that.
[43:02.25]Especially considering I have to consider, I just, everything about that I despised.
[43:06.72]This game was a 10 out of 10 until I got to that part of the game.
[43:11.71]I have to go across the whole fucking town to go to the beach, to get on the boat, to stealth around like a sloppy asshole, to look at the sarcophagus, to turn around, walk away, go back on the boat, go back in a fucking taxi, go back to fucking downtown.
[43:28.04]That mission was stupid.
[43:29.12]That mission sucked.
[43:30.50]Asshole.
[43:34.71]Where's the fucking... Where's the taxi?
[43:36.05]Where's the taxi?
[43:43.06]Get me out of here.
[43:46.87]What is this?
[43:47.25]Is the taxi closed?
[43:54.91]I need blood, too.
[44:01.26]Where's the humanity?
[44:04.84]Um... I think I have to go back through here.
[44:08.93]Also, chat lied to you.
[44:09.97]Stealth wasn't required for that mission.
[44:11.69]You just got a bonus.
[44:15.39]No.
[44:17.37]Well, good.
[44:17.93]Hopefully stealth is never required, ever.
[44:23.26]No, the mission wasn't hard.
[44:24.26]It was just boring and stupid.
[44:26.16]Are you saying that Twitch chat lied?
[44:33.53]Oh, God.
[44:39.66]Where's this fucking tower?
[44:47.72]Let me up there.
[44:49.56]Wait.
[44:55.53]He told me to send you up as soon as you came in.
[44:56.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:57.95]I am gone.
[44:58.35]Thank you.
[45:05.13]Okay.
[45:07.64]We lied for your own good.
[45:10.66]Where did I get the visor?
[45:12.02]I've said all I need to for now.
[45:17.18]That's the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
[45:21.46]Easy.
[45:22.90]Easy, guys.
[45:23.64]Whoa.
[45:24.90]Whoops.
[45:31.55]I don't have time for a monologue.
[45:33.65]Give me the bullet points of what you saw.
[45:37.13]The decks were washed with the blood of seamen.
[45:39.59]And the Ankoran sarcophagus.
[45:41.99]What did you see?
[45:42.55]There was blood on it, and it was a very boring, awful shit mission that you made me go on.
[45:47.11]I now don't like you.
[45:48.11]I'm now going to try to do everything possible to go against you.
[45:52.03]Opened?
[45:53.43]Let's not jump to conclusions.
[45:56.17]Give me the manifest in your notes.
[45:57.55]I'll sort this mess later.
[46:00.15]You might have noticed when you came in the parade of malingering mollycoddles filing out.
[46:08.18]Oh, yes.
[46:08.96]I wondered about them all this time.
[46:10.72]Sure.
[46:10.96]Um, that's me.
[46:29.77]Send in the ghouls.
[46:30.77]My blood is too valuable to waste.
[46:31.73]If it pleases you...
[46:53.65]Sure, I guess.
[46:54.79]I'm going to see this Malkavian.
[46:56.69]Okay.
[46:56.79]Okay, bye.
[46:57.00]So where do I go now?
[47:24.41]Uh... Contact this grout guy.
[47:30.10]Mansion on the outskirts of town.
[47:31.32]No, I don't... That sounds real fucking boring.
[47:35.24]Damsel sent you on the trail of the plague bearer, the kindred responsible for the outbreak of the LA epidemic.
[47:40.66]She has suggested going to speak with the ghoul Paul at the Skyline Apartments.
[47:44.57]We're talking to some of the bums around the city.
[47:55.67]Hmm.
[48:00.25]Carnival of Death.
[48:00.89]You saw the murder scene on the pier, but weren't able to find anything specific about the killer, except that he was extremely brutal, vicious, and beast-like.
[48:07.03]I'll just do this one for now.
[48:12.94]Skyline Apartments.
[48:18.50]I guess I missed the opportunity to do the hospital side quest.
[48:35.81]So, I guess I can find a bum.
[48:40.31]Wherever they hang out.
[48:41.31]Or the apartments.
[48:41.99]Where are the Skyline apartments?
[48:50.44]We'll go this way.
[48:51.64]That's the hotel.
[48:58.16]You look like a bum, but you're not responsive.
[49:04.15]I'm gonna eat somebody.
[49:05.23]I'm gonna get info and then I'm gonna eat the person.
[49:09.55]This is the last round.
[49:16.55]Here's a bump.
[49:18.51]I need to know the disease that haunts the homeless.
[49:20.21]20 bucks?
[49:28.52]How about I just go into your mind and tear it limb from limb?
[49:34.10]Okay.
[49:35.44]I mean, I don't know too much about nothing, but I know that Tin Can Bill's been telling some crazy stories about how he's got sick and all.
[49:42.19]Something about a monster of some such.
[49:45.01]Where's the man of the cans?
[49:46.13]You can usually find him down in his alleyway, just across from that bar nearby.
[49:49.89]Okay.
[49:51.69]Wait, is he talking about right here?
[49:54.72]Jesus, bring me a candle.
[49:56.46]It's Hanukkah.
[49:57.14]Get down here.
[49:57.64]Get away from my stuff.
[49:59.80]A helpful homeless person has pointed out Tin Can Bill as a possible link in the Plaguebearer chain.
[50:04.32]He can be found in the alley across from the last round.
[50:06.86]Okay.
[50:07.88]So, like, down here.
[50:10.54]Or down this way.
[50:12.62]Down here.
[50:19.01]Tin Can Bill?
[50:22.31]You're definitely not Tin Can Bill, but I'm gonna just eat you anyways.
[50:27.87]You don't have any blood.
[50:29.78]I got just enough blood where I'm not gonna have a problem.
[50:36.62]Tin Can Bill?
[50:38.26]You look like Tin Can Bill.
[50:40.68]Who's there, huh?
[50:42.32]Old Bill can't see too good these days.
[50:45.04]Is that you, Fred?
[50:46.71]I ain't got no booze tonight.
[50:48.19]I may as well get the hell out of here.
[50:54.14]Those of you that were here for the Call of Cthulhu stream, yet again we have an old man or an old decrepit person that has just added air in their throat.
[51:17.36]Keep your tongue wagging The voice changed
[51:41.98]Where is he?
[51:43.28]I do the voice for him.
[51:45.20]Where did the bestial brother take you?
[52:12.51]That was not in the script.
[52:13.43]Now you're just overdoing it.
[52:14.59]This is like Jim Carrey in The Mask.
[52:19.25]When the cop is holding him and he's just coughing and he wins the award.
[52:39.52]Same with this last lonely licker.
[52:41.18]Drunks always die alone.
[52:48.39]What did I just do?
[52:49.67]What?
[52:51.95]What happened?
[52:52.47]Why did I just freak out?
[52:53.97]He's dead.
[52:54.41]Why did he die?
[52:55.15]I have no idea what just happened.
[53:00.57]But apparently, I did something wrong.
[53:03.13]I went into a frenzy and I killed him.
[53:06.23]Tin Can Bill has pointed you in the direction of the sewers near where he took his last breath as possible home of the Plaguebearer.
[53:10.97]So we've got to go in the sewers over here somewhere.
[53:20.51]So where is the sewer?
[53:21.81]Right here.
[53:23.63]I need blood so bad.
[53:24.93]Is there like a... Come on, where's like the... Where's like the rich asshole that has like the best blood in the world because he gets it like pumped into him?
[53:35.57]I have to eat some rats.
[53:48.50]Looking for a rat to eat.
[53:49.88]There's one right there.
[53:50.78]I'm going rat hunting.
[53:58.16]I'm just gonna eat rats until I'm satisfied.
[54:00.74]How long is that gonna take?
[54:08.65]Just like a teaspoon of blood.
[54:10.05]That's alright.
[54:10.63]Alright, so... I guess we're just going over here.
[54:17.89]Um...
[54:32.78]I guess this is the only place I can go?
[54:34.64]There's nothing else really here.
[54:36.50]I guess this way?
[54:40.45]Looking for a Plaguebearer.
[54:45.89]Where's the Plaguebearer?
[54:48.11]He's hiding somewhere.
[54:49.22]I'm assuming he's just a guy.
[55:08.14]Looking for the pallbearer, plaguebearer.
[55:11.92]These are the wrong sewers.
[55:17.99]Huh?
[55:20.37]Wasn't this the manhole that was right next to this guy?
[55:26.35]The wrong manhole.
[55:27.17]Wasn't this, like, literally, like, not even 15 yards away from the hobo?
[55:31.45]Maybe it was the wrong one.
[55:38.74]There was one even closer.
[55:42.90]Well, I'm hearing fucking... What am I hearing here?
[55:52.62]There was another manhole.
[55:54.78]Well, I've ran in a circle and I don't even fucking remember where the hell I even came from.
[55:59.44]I have no idea which one I even came up from.
[56:03.80]No, I'm being baited again.
[56:11.74]So I am being baited.
[56:12.72]It's not real.
[56:17.08]Can I get in here?
[56:19.36]I don't know what to believe anymore.
[56:27.65]It's not even in this sewer.
[56:34.11]Well, I'm just going to go up this one because I have no idea where I am.
[56:36.94]And I will find the one next to the homeless guy.
[56:47.14]Okay.
[56:50.22]So, wait.
[56:52.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[56:54.63]That was the right one.
[56:55.49]So where is this... There's this dead body.
[57:00.39]Where's the manhole?
[57:02.91]Right here?
[57:03.55]What the fuck?
[57:05.76]Oh my god.
[57:09.08]It wasn't a bait.
[57:10.06]It actually was down here.
[57:15.40]I came up through one, and went to the other one that was five feet away.
[57:18.82]Alright, Mr. Plaguebearer.
[57:26.50]Where are you?
[57:29.67]Hanging out with the rats.
[57:39.94]They're both going to go to the same place.
[57:41.98]No, I'm going to get grabbed.
[57:43.08]He's going to be over here and he's going to jump up and bite my neck or something.
[57:46.59]And I'm going to be really, really annoyed.
[57:47.75]I love how you get more blood from rats than you do from a human bum.
[58:03.28]I'm going to fill my health bar.
[58:17.93]As opposed to another, like, bump.
[58:21.60]Alright, I think we're good.
[58:33.10]Safe.
[58:38.44]Any guy here?
[58:39.25]Hello?
[58:42.45]This looks pretty menacing.
[58:50.93]I think I found the thing I'm supposed to find.
[58:52.61]This is definitely, if I was a plague bearer, this is where I would be.
[59:06.96]Absolutely.
[59:08.48]On your way down here, did you?
[59:10.97]Following the smell of entrails and rotting flesh.
[59:16.49]He's not lying, I was.
[59:21.93]What is the business of the bestial brother?
[59:23.61]Ah, this place is dark and devilish as my soul.
[59:26.77]The doors have been opened, the seals broken, and the final steps into the abyss.
[59:33.05]The terrible mysteries of the ninth circle.
[59:36.86]Is this guy like four feet tall, or is the weird camera here for some reason?
[59:42.02]What is the business?
[59:43.08]What's your business?
[59:43.66]Brother Kanker, they call me.
[59:45.42]High Lord in the diseased halls of the dead.
[59:48.02]Look around you.
[59:51.05]This guy's made out of plastic.
[59:52.33]Somebody held a lighter to this guy's head.
[59:55.25]These are the signs.
[59:57.45]The coming of a new age.
[60:02.04]Ah, okay.
[60:02.98]The brotherhood of the Ninth Circle.
[60:05.98]The darkest dawn is almost upon us.
[60:08.96]This is Robert Echendon.
[60:10.87]Come, join us in these last nights, spreading our disease upon the earth, sharing this unholy communion with our human heart.
[60:20.51]That's Robert Echendon.
[60:22.51]He's everywhere.
[60:24.24]You can always tell when it's him.
[60:27.14]They are the weak, sick, hopeless...
[60:32.11]I bring them a new purpose.
[60:34.93]They are the vessels of darkness, carrying the diseased truth in their veins.
[60:42.02]So, this guy died?
[60:43.16]Yes, truth.
[60:43.64]Might I join your putrid platoon?
[60:45.24]Come.
[60:46.30]Join the disciples who have gathered here, floating in their own putrescence.
[60:52.13]I will show you the mysteries of our brotherhood as I feed on your flesh!
[60:59.26]It seems we will not unite, Dark Brother.
[61:01.80]I will send your ashes to the Ninth Circle.
[61:05.16]Oh!
[61:06.27]Okay!
[61:09.07]Oh!
[61:09.65]Ow!
[61:11.23]Ow!
[61:17.76]Get away, get away, get away, get away!
[61:35.93]Get out of here!
[61:43.85]Press tab to block.
[61:44.95]Oh, well, whatever.
[61:45.99]Didn't even need it.
[61:46.47]Alright, so what do we got here?
[61:53.96]We got a lever.
[61:56.86]That opens something.
[61:58.00]It opens the gates.
[61:59.92]There's a lever here.
[62:04.26]And there's a lever on the... There's a wheel on the other side.
[62:10.47]I don't know what that does, exactly.
[62:15.29]I'm not so... I'm not sure.
[62:16.43]What does that do?
[62:17.49]I can spin them both this way or both the other way?
[62:21.15]I can't see what they're opening.
[62:25.67]I guess there's a block button.
[62:26.73]Well, this is like more of a stance.
[62:30.81]I guess those don't do anything.
[62:34.45]So, you've killed Brother Canker.
[62:36.10]Brother Canker, report back to Damsel.
[62:45.62]Alright, well, we're going to swim down there, apparently.
[62:52.53]I can already hear it.
[62:53.23]You should have done the tutorial, because I don't know how to swim.
[62:54.93]Okay, there we go.
[63:02.42]See, that was interesting.
[63:03.12]That was cool.
[63:03.54]I liked that mission.
[63:04.88]This was cool.
[63:05.88]That was interesting.
[63:06.54]He was scary.
[63:07.18]He was weird.
[63:07.72]He made a lot of cool noises.
[63:10.09]We killed him.
[63:11.85]Got the EXP for it.
[63:19.60]Now we go back.
[63:24.08]Holster.
[63:27.28]And here we go.
[63:29.73]Up we go.
[63:30.83]Back to the bar.
[63:35.14]Can I buy some proper clothes?
[63:36.88]The gardener outfit.
[63:38.02]I can't even talk right now.
[63:43.64]Where am I?
[63:44.08]What?
[63:44.78]What happened here?
[63:47.12]What?
[63:48.54]I thought that was going to bring me up.
[63:51.85]Where am I?
[63:52.75]What is going on right now?
[63:53.99]What happened?
[63:58.39]I thought there was going to be a ladder going up.
[64:02.86]Okay.
[64:05.86]That's not the right way to go.
[64:12.24]Interestingly enough.
[64:21.61]Yeah.
[64:23.15]Maybe I'll try this one.
[64:29.20]I found it.
[64:31.86]Up we go.
[64:34.48]Hello.
[64:35.22]So now let's go back to downtown.
[64:45.89]Wait, I think we are in downtown.
[64:50.63]Yes, we are.
[64:51.31]Well, excuse me.
[64:52.53]I will take your blood.
[64:55.37]You don't even have a rat amount of blood in your body.
[65:00.15]What a joke.
[65:08.62]So what do we get for doing this?
[65:09.46]What are you gonna give me?
[65:14.07]The carrier pigeon is extinct!
[65:15.84]Huh?
[65:15.92]I gotta kill another one?
[65:17.44]Okay.
[65:17.62]More pigeons for this cat to catch.
[65:36.96]Prince?
[65:37.48]Okay.
[65:37.96]Damsel has informed me that there is more than one Plaguebearer in the city, and they all need to be destroyed.
[65:43.50]She had previously suggested going to speak with the Ghoul Paul at the Skyline Apartments.
[65:48.96]Okay.
[65:51.10]So... Jerma here.
[65:54.70]We have our two bites out of an ice cream bar.
[65:57.80]That's our faction.
[66:00.16]And I'm gonna put another point.
[66:01.32]I have eight points.
[66:03.72]Strength?
[66:05.59]I'm gonna say either strength or brawl.
[66:10.64]Dodge.
[66:16.56]I can't put one in melee.
[66:19.84]I don't know.
[66:20.92]Maybe I should just put it in strength.
[66:24.00]It's a mirror.
[66:34.95]Let's do strength.
[66:40.68]Just hit harder.
[66:41.28]I'll put one into firearms just because I have the points.
[66:54.03]Let's go kill the other one.
[66:58.39]Yeah, does my hair ever get any better?
[66:59.61]Do I ever get, like, a new haircut?
[67:02.39]Can I sit in, like, the WoW barber?
[67:05.38]Alright, we gotta get this, like, we gotta get this fucking... No one's even gonna look.
[67:12.25]Well, the guys in the hazmat suits will.
[67:13.89]Alright, so where are those apartments?
[67:17.73]Let's see.
[67:21.55]Skyline Apartments are two.
[67:23.47]They're far away.
[67:24.53]So I gotta go, like, across the whole city here.
[67:30.07]Uh, so it looks like it's down here.
[67:32.65]I just gotta go all the way around.
[67:39.49]I get a silly hat in the next outfit?
[67:41.51]Sign me up.
[67:48.37]Did I see the WoW expansion reveal?
[67:50.42]Uh, I... I didn't pay very much attention to it.
[67:53.22]It's like, uh... Orcs versus humans again, right?
[67:56.28]They're going back to the... PvP-esque... They want to go back to having, like, Horde versus Alliance, right?
[68:03.87]Lovely evening.
[68:05.00]It is.
[68:05.50]Okay, so I'm here.
[68:07.80]Just keep going.
[68:09.40]Down this way.
[68:11.52]Let's make sure I'm going the right way here.
[68:13.48]Where are the... Six.
[68:17.43]Okay.
[68:20.57]So I do have to go down here.
[68:26.20]I think I'm going the right way.
[68:31.42]I'm probably not gonna get involved with it.
[68:33.16]I'm not gonna play it, I don't think.
[68:35.90]Not anymore.
[68:40.79]Parking here.
[68:41.29]This is not the right way.
[68:45.57]I had my time with it, and I played the absolute hell out of it.
[68:48.55]Okay, just straight into the left.
[68:55.69]Save.
[69:01.88]What was that?
[69:03.14]A knife.
[69:03.60]Don't need it.
[69:05.74]Skyline Apartments.
[69:07.96]Confession.
[69:08.96]That doesn't look like apartments.
[69:12.16]Skyline Apartments.
[69:12.90]Here we go.
[69:17.54]Find the guy and murder him in his hotel room.
[69:21.24]Because he's definitely a bad guy.
[69:22.64]Alright, we're looking for... Who are we looking for?
[69:29.66]P. Anderson.
[69:30.34]What was his name?
[69:31.76]Paul?
[69:32.96]Five?
[69:40.96]Pretty sure it was five.
[69:41.78]Did I pick four?
[69:43.24]Not six.
[69:45.77]Which one did I press?
[69:46.43]I think I pressed the right one.
[69:54.73]Use the vents.
[69:58.95]A long elevator.
[70:05.81]Here's five.
[70:07.13]Okay.
[70:08.99]His door is open.
[70:13.70]Maybe I shouldn't just barge in.
[70:15.32]I should probably sneak around.
[70:19.46]Oh, there he is.
[70:19.94]Is that him?
[70:20.32]Am I going to get a telephone call?
[70:26.57]Oh boy.
[70:28.01]I just got pushed by something.
[70:30.19]Something moved.
[70:30.81]Okay, I just got scared.
[70:32.61]Something's right here.
[70:34.57]What am I on?
[70:35.93]Is this his body I'm getting stuck on?
[70:56.56]Weird.
[70:58.30]Alright, so he's in here somewhere.
[71:02.40]He's in the bathroom.
[71:04.96]I open the door and he's just sitting on the toilet.
[71:06.50]I'm like, hey!
[71:07.98]Give me some privacy!
[71:10.27]Ow.
[71:10.95]My wrist.
[71:15.95]Obviously, we're going upstairs.
[71:19.49]Everyone's gonna freak out if I don't do this, so I have to.
[71:23.97]Can't do it.
[71:30.61]In the bed, line of the bed.
[71:31.77]Is he gonna be like the grandmother from Red Riding Hood?
[71:35.47]I'm taking a chair with me.
[71:54.01]Is he in here?
[71:54.81]Where are you, dude?
[72:02.12]Paul the ghoul is dead presumably another victim of the epidemic sweeping LA you heard a message from someone named Hannah on his answering machine Asking him to come over to her apartment also in the skyline building her key her key code is 1203 All right, we're gonna find Hannah Well that chairs gone Can I pick up the tape tables coming with us
[72:29.89]Damn it!
[72:31.09]No!
[72:31.65]Shit!
[72:32.17]Where did it go?
[72:32.65]Fuck!
[72:33.65]Where did it go?
[72:34.19]I wanted to bring that whole table with me.
[72:41.02]I'm so annoyed right now.
[72:44.38]I can't, like, bring a couch?
[72:47.04]Ugh.
[72:49.00]That is so sad.
[72:49.76]Fucking chair will do.
[72:55.82]God damn it.
[73:02.77]God, come on.
[73:10.89]Why does everything have to disappear?
[73:12.23]You're going to order McDonald's.
[73:16.89]Yeah, give me number one.
[73:18.43]Number one, medium with a Coke and a five, six piece McNugget, whatever you can get me.
[73:29.33]And, oh, this is not right.
[73:31.53]Let's just guess this.
[73:34.05]Is this her door?
[73:37.21]Well, I don't think, maybe this is, I don't know whose room this is.
[73:42.49]Somebody that's a fan of rock music.
[73:46.34]Maybe I can take this person's couch.
[73:47.76]Oh, boy, you got some expensive equipment, don't you, buddy?
[73:52.58]All right, please tell me that I can take this person's table.
[74:10.07]You got nothing important, but you definitely have a table up here that I can take, right?
[74:16.01]Mom's best brew.
[74:26.90]What is this?
[74:28.36]Photo.
[74:32.04]Can we just hide in here?
[74:33.57]That's terrifying.
[74:37.91]What's the photo?
[74:39.53]A blurry photo of what looks to be a Nosferatu.
[74:42.15]Okay.
[74:48.81]I tell you, the way this game handles doors... It's just... It's just not... It's just not happy with me.
[74:56.58]It's not a happy day with me.
[75:03.44]Oh, this is... I can just go up and down, huh?
[75:05.20]Alright, well, have I been here?
[75:07.60]Okay, this is the guy's room.
[75:10.08]This brings us to the bottom here.
[75:11.28]Let's go up.
[75:14.21]Don't even need to get the code right, I'm assuming.
[75:16.29]This is the second floor.
[75:21.49]Car stereo.
[75:24.49]I'm just, like, stealing everybody's stuff.
[75:28.43]Alright, that's fine.
[75:40.61]Dirty laundry.
[75:41.71]Kendo for advanced students.
[75:48.65]Okay.
[75:51.75]Just going in and take everything.
[75:53.50]And then I can't take the bed, right?
[75:55.76]Oh well.
[75:59.48]That one guy had the table I could bring with me.
[76:02.22]That's so sad.
[76:05.32]That is just sad.
[76:20.79]I need to go back to the stairs.
[76:22.73]Or the ladder here.
[76:26.01]This would be floor number three, right?
[76:29.39]A table.
[76:33.03]Can I pick it up?
[76:36.25]Damn it.
[76:39.11]Telephone.
[76:42.97]No.
[76:44.11]Why am I trying just to... Why am I vandalizing everybody's rooms?
[76:53.42]What kind of sauce should you get?
[76:54.65]I don't know.
[76:55.91]Definitely the... Wicked Morty Sauce!
[77:02.43]What's the code here?
[77:06.41]Don't I know the code?
[77:11.13]I can't go into the code.
[77:15.48]This has to be it, right?
[77:17.60]Oh, well.
[77:27.29]I was making a joke.
[77:29.47]I wasn't actually saying that.
[77:32.89]Come on.
[77:38.44]Okay, here's this guy's room.
[77:41.12]Let's go up again.
[77:46.06]This is the top floor.
[77:47.44]There's no other rooms I can go in.
[77:49.57]Of course, I can't even open this.
[77:58.64]Oh, come on.
[78:04.06]Can I reverse donate?
[78:06.16]So I have to actually... Strats.
[78:15.18]Utilize them at some point, guys.
[78:16.34]Shit.
[78:43.20]Okay, well, I just did my three in a MOBA.
[78:49.40]Oh, look!
[78:50.78]Email, apartment notes.
[78:52.42]Apartment notes.
[78:55.94]How about apartment six?
[78:58.91]Type list to get available commands.
[79:00.95]List.
[79:03.51]Apartment six.
[79:05.48]Apartment 6.
[79:06.34]Hannah Glazer.
[79:07.28]The gold mine.
[79:08.50]Something hot is always going down in here, and that something is usually Hannah herself.
[79:14.15]Mm-hmm.
[79:15.03]Email.
[79:16.53]Password required.
[79:17.69]Hmm.
[79:18.91]Hack it up.
[79:21.34]JR at Germa.
[79:25.30]Email.
[79:27.68]What?
[79:29.44]Whatever.
[79:30.22]I already got it.
[79:31.56]Number 6.
[79:34.90]Oh, this guy's actually spying on that girl.
[79:36.70]Well, that's terrifying.
[79:39.45]Pizza!
[79:46.83]Wait, do I want to go this way?
[79:52.98]Hold on, itchy head.
[79:57.36]How many doors?
[79:57.90]Uh, I guess I am just gonna go this way.
[80:00.50]Okay, she's number six.
[80:08.29]So can I just go to her front door?
[80:13.03]Just go to 6.
[80:13.67]I guess.
[80:16.75]What was it?
[80:18.32]1203?
[80:18.36]What was it?
[80:18.88]1283?
[80:18.90]1285?
[80:18.92]What was it? 25?
[80:42.59]Here.
[80:43.71]Password.
[80:44.15]1-2-0-3.
[80:46.39]Ding dong.
[80:48.90]Okay, Hannah.
[80:52.54]I'm here.
[80:53.92]I'm here to rescue you.
[80:57.96]And raid your fridge.
[81:03.35]Safe key.
[81:08.09]Anything else?
[81:08.83]What else you got in here?
[81:13.15]Washing machine.
[81:14.07]Nothing worth looking at.
[81:15.49]There was something else upstairs.
[81:32.30]She's home.
[81:33.70]No.
[81:33.98]Paul was blinded by the light.
[81:47.38]Let the veils of madness paint you a vision of Paul.
[81:50.12]Yes, sweet little fly.
[81:54.01]Tell me of the sickened spider who bit you.
[81:56.97]Tell me your tale.
[82:13.02]A lead.
[82:13.26]Did you dance with the spider?
[82:15.03]Where was the web of this black widow?
[82:16.73]Empire Hotel.
[82:17.17]Jezebel.
[82:17.45]Paul is six feet closer to hell.
[82:44.96]Don't worry.
[82:52.23]No one will miss your tattered soul.
[82:58.03]Why am I killing these people?
[83:00.17]I don't understand that.
[83:04.35]She just... She died.
[83:06.76]I didn't do that, right?
[83:09.14]Otherwise my humanity would go down, wouldn't it?
[83:12.32]What's in here?
[83:14.54]Whoa, you got $200 in here.
[83:19.08]Nice.
[83:20.76]And I'm going to really confuse... I'm going to really confuse the fucking cops that come in here.
[83:26.06]They're going to get into this safe and they're going to be like, what the fuck?
[83:29.92]Who is this?
[83:31.64]No, I want this.
[83:32.30]You can't have that.
[83:32.96]Okay, let's go.
[83:40.01]No.
[83:40.35]Out and down.
[83:41.81]Now, this is a faster way to get down.
[83:42.65]You guys have already seen me do it.
[84:13.13]Here we go.
[84:25.50]Okay.
[84:31.93]Going too fast.
[84:35.01]Yes, I am.
[84:39.58]Exit.
[84:40.54]Exit.
[84:41.90]Empire Hotel.
[84:45.88]Can I stop streaming so you can go to bed?
[84:47.49]I actually will be stopping streaming after this quest chain.
[84:53.09]So, after I kill this next Plaguebearer, we are going to be done for tonight.
[85:02.79]There's the Empire Arms Hotel.
[85:09.21]Let's go find Jezebel.
[85:16.27]Can I manipulate you into telling me what I want to know?
[85:18.14]Yes.
[85:18.40]May I help you?
[85:19.84]I seek Queen Jezebel.
[85:21.02]Yes.
[85:21.70]Miss Locke is one of our more popular guests.
[85:26.00]Why do you ask?
[85:27.24]I need the key to her kingdom.
[85:29.90]Are you sure?
[85:31.66]I am the key master and you will make me a key.
[85:38.62]Malkavian sure is.
[85:43.86]Malkavian seems like it's actually the best thing to play.
[85:47.74]Can anybody else do that?
[85:53.08]You know what I mean?
[85:53.61]I feel like nobody else can do that.
[85:59.03]So what, what, what room is she in?
[86:02.87]Uh, key ring.
[86:03.65]Your key ring contains Jezebel Locke's key.
[86:08.26]Well, can... Which room is she in?
[86:15.82]What room is she in?
[86:16.44]There's a lot of rooms here.
[86:24.59]What are you... You're speaking smoke inside?
[86:26.51]What...
[86:29.52]Excuse me.
[86:31.08]What is her room number?
[86:36.50]Oh, Lord.
[86:36.98]I don't know what the hell.
[86:38.15]I have no idea.
[86:38.75]I have to, like, investigate.
[86:41.33]There's got to be some computer or something, right?
[86:43.47]I want to dance.
[86:48.95]I want to dance on stage.
[87:00.10]How come I want to dance?
[87:01.24]Can I sing?
[87:05.65]Oh, no.
[87:06.11]I just took the mic.
[87:06.91]I'm like the asshole that goes on stage.
[87:10.01]Give me the mic.
[87:10.51]I'm going to ruin the show.
[87:15.05]These speakers, too.
[87:20.73]Why can't I dance?
[87:27.41]That's bullshit.
[87:29.37]I'm not allowed to dance.
[87:31.71]Whoa, you can actually swing here.
[87:33.45]Violation!
[87:46.38]Violation!
[87:51.69]You are in contempt of court.
[87:57.27]Let me bite this motherfucker.
[88:06.02]This guy has a lot of blood.
[88:11.28]And thank you for that.
[88:13.02]Now let's go real quick over here.
[88:16.39]Use this.
[88:18.91]No, I want to use the gun.
[88:22.88]Use.
[88:23.42]There you go.
[88:25.46]Okay, so let's actually play the thing we were just gonna do.
[88:35.36]Someone is still dancing.
[88:39.18]Somebody was still dancing.
[88:49.75]That's unbelievable.
[88:57.69]Oh, where is she?
[88:58.75]I don't want to, like, have to talk to other people.
[89:02.13]Yeah, I came here to party.
[89:07.58]I don't give a shit.
[89:11.42]Okay, computer, microwave.
[89:13.02]That's a fucking microwave, not a computer.
[89:15.69]Coffee?
[89:16.55]Coffee.
[89:17.51]Nothing here.
[89:22.37]Can I bring my... Please, let me, like, bring the microwave out there and fucking throw it in somebody's face.
[89:26.63]Hey, look, a computer.
[89:27.65]And a card catalog.
[89:29.85]Automated systems access.
[89:31.23]Jezebel locks key came out.
[89:34.41]Okay.
[89:37.13]Here we go.
[89:37.57]Guest logs.
[89:38.79]Or suites.
[89:40.63]Suites.
[89:41.71]The password is available.
[89:43.47]Hack it.
[89:46.43]I'm gonna go crazy, aren't I?
[89:49.26]Skill too low.
[89:49.92]Fucking goddammit.
[90:07.07]Well, I have everything I need.
[90:19.52]Look, it's alright.
[90:20.72]I'm cheating.
[90:21.34]Somebody in chat just told me what it was.
[90:24.00]Like, whatever.
[90:26.30]I would have figured it out.
[90:27.02]It would have taken me a minute, but I would have figured it out soon.
[90:39.28]Ballroom.
[90:41.92]Only one door opens, so it's this one.
[90:46.63]I need blood.
[90:47.39]There's room four.
[90:48.29]Use the key card or check what's in here.
[90:50.05]Nothing.
[90:52.47]Use the key.
[90:53.70]Oh yeah, who do we have here?
[90:57.16]Are you a believer, little morsel?
[90:59.90]Have you come for the kind of enlightenment only Jezebel can give?
[91:03.99]Something's going on with her cheeks.
[91:06.59]Look at that.
[91:07.09]Look at her cheek.
[91:08.75]Her cheek is disconnecting from her face.
[91:13.09]She's going to be the plague bearer.
[91:13.99]She's going to rip off her human skin.
[91:16.09]There's going to be a monster under there.
[91:17.57]You want to dance?
[91:19.89]Yes.
[91:20.59]I'd rather pierce my tongue with barbed wire.
[91:24.90]You are a dangerous dark beauty without compare.
[91:42.28]Oh, come on now.
[91:44.44]Don't deny yourself the pleasure of Jezebel's talents.
[91:49.18]Just a few more steps and we can be enveloped by the sweet darkness.
[91:54.90]Become slaves to the desires of our wasted flesh.
[91:59.92]There is a strange seduction in your viral reproduction.
[92:03.42]Oh, you cannot escape me, little morsel.
[92:07.69]One way or another, you and I will intertwine our beings on the way into the Ninth Circle.
[92:14.43]And I will send you forth.
[92:16.97]Just jumping right into marriage.
[92:18.43]Oh, the sweet sickness I carry.
[92:22.35]Can I finally join your shadow circle?
[92:24.25]Don't you stick to the paid seductresses?
[92:28.74]Dark is my soul, but darker your dreams, and hell, die!
[92:39.71]Did she die?
[92:46.07]Just stay right there for a minute!
[93:00.20]Die!
[93:00.58]What happened to her head?
[93:02.54]What happened to her head?
[93:03.60]Where's her head?
[93:04.56]I told you something was weird!
[93:08.68]Why am I using the shotgun?
[93:13.58]No.
[93:14.00]No.
[93:14.24]God damn it.
[93:15.28]I'm using the shotgun for no reason.
[93:16.74]Because I wanted to see her fly around.
[93:18.14]Can I take her into the hall?
[93:20.28]Alright.
[93:20.50]Let's take this into the hallway.
[93:23.71]Ow.
[93:24.03]Shit.
[93:24.43]Okay.
[93:24.65]Come on.
[93:25.21]Follow me over this way.
[93:26.71]Nice and easy.
[93:28.33]Alright.
[93:28.73]Just don't mind the guests.
[93:30.69]Okay.
[93:33.09]Call the elevator.
[93:33.63]Let's get her down here.
[93:36.53]Come on.
[93:37.73]Get in.
[93:39.21]Fuck you.
[93:45.24]Oh no, we have to fucking watch this again.
[93:47.34]This time, give me the knife.
[93:58.02]I have melee skill.
[94:05.95]Are you the Wicked Queen?
[94:06.71]Yes, you are.
[94:07.79]You're dangerous.
[94:09.89]There's dangerous, there's strange shit going on here.
[94:12.98]Dark as your soul, die!
[94:14.12]Here we go.
[94:33.79]I'm taking her in the elevator.
[94:36.95]You better fucking believe she's coming with me in the elevator.
[94:44.39]Oh, shit!
[94:45.13]No!
[94:45.43]What?
[94:45.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[94:46.98]It loads...
[95:04.98]I can't bite her.
[95:06.00]Oh well, I fucked it up already.
[95:16.92]That didn't block.
[95:17.94]I think I have to reload this.
[95:28.19]I'm trying to do a fucking stupid bit and screw everything up.
[95:32.55]Now she dies.
[95:33.63]Now she dies without a single issue.
[95:36.13]I'm not going to get hit one time.
[95:54.00]Come on.
[95:55.06]Let's do that again.
[96:19.60]I'm back against the wall.
[96:27.45]Come on, you bitch.
[96:30.17]Come and get me.
[96:32.49]What?
[96:33.15]No, that's bullshit.
[96:34.15]You guys know that.
[96:34.84]That was not fair.
[96:42.21]Reload, reload the gun!
[96:43.85]Reload the gun!
[96:45.14]Ooh, no hit run, here we go!
[97:00.49]Didn't get hit once.
[97:01.13]All right, I gotta investigate her room.
[97:11.45]You got a chest here.
[97:13.71]Brotherhood flyer?
[97:16.31]Is this on the table here?
[97:17.79]ABC always be closing.
[97:22.07]And... One of the most awful, terribly designed bathtub jacuzzis I've ever seen.
[97:32.61]How are you supposed to sit in this?
[97:36.17]Who is this made for?
[97:44.09]It's like somebody went into Maya and just smeared their hand around.
[97:50.37]Nobody actually can fit in there.
[97:54.51]Second toilet.
[97:58.10]Oh, that's not a... I thought this was a double toilet.
[98:00.46]No.
[98:02.16]It's a Lovecraftian bath.
[98:03.62]Alright, that's it.
[98:06.94]Turn it in.
[98:08.72]You killed a second plaguebearer and found a fly with a strange symbol on it.
[98:11.18]You should go talk to Damsel about this.
[98:13.46]Yes, I will.
[98:16.70]That knife is the same knife.
[98:19.56]Down we go.
[98:28.71]Open.
[98:28.95]Thank you.
[98:33.55]I got some more info.
[98:34.39]Hey, thanks.
[98:35.07]Yeah, I'm no longer needed here.
[98:40.06]Didn't even see.
[98:40.54]I was so quick.
[98:42.18]That's what I'm talking about.
[98:42.78]I'm talking about Mars.
[98:45.69]Mars reflexes and Mars gaming skills.
[98:47.99]I was so quick and so precise.
[98:49.41]That guy didn't even fucking see me.
[98:50.53]I'm not going to do it again, just in case you missed it.
[98:54.43]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[98:56.49]What's happening?
[98:59.23]No, what?
[99:00.35]Why am I doing this?
[99:05.01]Ah!
[99:08.00]No!
[99:11.12]Oh, no.
[99:11.64]Oh, no.
[99:13.16]I lost humanity.
[99:14.12]God damn it.
[99:41.76]Who's playing the piano?
[99:54.25]I don't think so, buddy.
[99:56.19]I don't know.
[99:56.63]I think I'm, like, in trouble right now.
[99:58.35]I think I'm gonna... I can't reload it.
[100:01.87]Alright, I'm gonna do opposite... I'm gonna do opposite gate right when I open the door.
[100:11.29]They're going to be right here.
[100:12.83]Invisible.
[100:13.23]Can't see me.
[100:15.03]Okay.
[100:15.13]I made it.
[100:44.80]Now I have to drink this guy.
[100:51.67]When do they... Okay, police are hunting.
[100:53.61]Call off the search.
[101:01.51]Eventually I'm going to drain blood from this security guard.
[101:04.87]Save it right here.
[101:08.01]Over there?
[101:09.29]No.
[101:09.53]I wish this guy was a shotgun.
[101:10.37]Get the fuck out of here.
[101:13.77]Just move on.
[101:14.31]Move on with your life.
[101:15.85]He's not down here.
[101:20.07]I think I'm going to drink the officer.
[101:24.10]Yeah, I am.
[101:25.84]He's probably got tons of good blood.
[101:33.67]Oh, shit.
[101:34.15]They've given up.
[101:34.53]Never mind.
[101:35.01]Forget it.
[101:43.94]That guy coughed on me and my invisibility was gone.
[101:52.56]What am I doing?
[101:54.30]What's wrong with me?
[101:57.80]What is wrong with my character?
[102:04.44]This guy was diseased?
[102:10.56]What did you get for being diseased?
[102:14.23]And I lost another fucking humanity.
[102:15.89]What am I doing?
[102:17.03]Stop it!
[102:18.93]Look how many cops are out here.
[102:24.16]Oh, I've ruined it all.
[102:25.18]It's all over from here.
[102:28.86]So wait, the police aren't hunting me anymore, right?
[102:34.10]I think, yeah, the police are no longer hunting me.
[102:42.57]My health is back.
[102:43.43]Okay, so I just need to go back to the bar.
[102:52.50]Everything's gonna be fine.
[102:59.26]What was that?
[103:03.14]Am I seeing things or did somebody just... What am I seeing right now?
[103:12.83]What who is this who's this the flash here from fucking DC Comics Apparently that was really weird that was this bar.
[103:33.31]Oh
[103:38.46]Uh, the last round, number nine.
[103:40.20]I think it's down this way to the right.
[103:43.06]I can't tell what's a bug and what's an illusion.
[103:59.58]You Malkovian.
[104:05.07]Wait.
[104:07.05]I'm so confused.
[104:07.63]I just went back the other direction, didn't I?
[104:11.36]No, I didn't.
[104:11.74]Okay, good.
[104:15.72]Alright.
[104:17.98]Give me my reward that I deserve.
[104:25.29]I did another.
[104:26.95]Paul is dead.
[104:28.91]We told him to burn the blood and go to the hospital.
[104:32.15]Said he thought he'd get over it.
[104:33.43]Men are stubborn that way.
[104:34.88]This proves the plague bearer's gotta be found.
[104:36.98]Yep.
[104:37.58]Does this paper symbol speak to your mind?
[104:38.98]I will flush out the pigeon.
[104:39.92]I wonder something.
[104:40.84]What does this mean?
[104:41.38]Yeah, I've seen this.
[104:42.62]Pretty sure I've seen it around here somewhere.
[104:44.52]One of the buildings, I think.
[104:46.46]I trust your eyes, memory, and seek it nearby.
[104:48.36]I wonder something from your mind first.
[104:49.76]Yeah?
[104:50.56]It's a number for a name.
[104:51.63]The gesture is Jack in the Box.
[104:54.93]Jack?
[104:55.59]Jack's Jack?
[104:56.97]okay I am gone damsel has told you that the symbol on the flyer you found when you killed the second plague bearer is also on one of the buildings in town is it not yeah I've seen this I'm pretty sure I've seen it around here somewhere one of the buildings I think okay where is this thing brotherhood fly so I am enlightened I'm looking for this and one of the buildings nearby

[105:35.30]Where is it?
[105:42.35]Buildings nearby.
[105:43.83]Looking for the skull.
[105:46.29]Hmm.
[105:48.39]Hmm.
[105:50.53]Hmm.
[105:54.73]Skull.
[105:58.84]In the graffiti here somewhere?
[105:59.88]Eh.
[106:00.70]Eh.
[106:09.47]By nearby, does she mean literal nearby, or does she mean somewhere completely not even close to where I am?
[106:31.56]I don't know.
[106:40.97]Graffiti was inside you the whole time.
[106:45.09]Can't do anything about this.
[106:46.03]I can climb here, though.
[106:47.41]Why would I be... Alright, I'm just going in somebody's room.
[106:50.87]I just climbed in the bathroom window.
[106:57.62]Okay, odd.
[107:02.54]Oh, let's just up here.
[107:09.49]Get out of the way, please.
[107:13.99]I'm stuck.
[107:16.95]I can clearly walk forward.
[107:21.59]Just get up back the same way I came in for crying out loud.
[107:26.37]Is that even the right bathroom?
[107:27.85]What if that was the fucking poster?
[107:28.93]Get me out of here.
[107:34.84]Go.
[107:35.56]Get me out.
[107:41.02]This is a long quest chain, huh?
[107:51.46]Um, down here, maybe?
[107:58.65]Instant cash, buy, sell.
[108:00.31]That's not it.
[108:00.91]Looking for a poster.
[108:09.13]Not down, like, with this alley, huh?
[108:11.39]I don't think so.
[108:15.60]Uh-huh.
[108:16.74]Well, not over here, guys and girls.
[108:30.07]Hmm.
[108:32.43]This can be opened.
[108:33.11]Just kind of curious what's even in here.
[108:41.46]It's just a little bomb sanctuary.
[108:43.08]It's all good.
[108:56.49]Okay, I did not mean to do that.
[108:58.79]Good thing she had no idea and didn't know what it was.
[109:07.03]I went the wrong fucking way.
[109:08.25]Oyoyoyoyoy.
[109:09.17]Let's get back on the main road.
[109:19.89]Move.
[109:21.15]Move, you bastard.
[109:24.07]All right.
[109:24.99]Let's get onto Main Street.
[109:29.01]The main road.
[109:30.91]That's just dogs.
[109:33.21]Here we go.
[109:34.87]Look for the symbol.
[109:37.41]You guys have to help me, because I need help looking.
[109:39.95]You guys have to... Look, there's like 2,000 eyes looking in every direction here.
[109:43.83]Isn't that fascinating?
[109:47.92]We'll solve the puzzle so quickly.
[109:51.10]Found it.
[109:53.16]Okay, so let's go in here.
[109:58.10]Can't go in here.
[110:07.82]And... Hello!
[110:11.28]Brotherhood.
[110:11.78]Where's the Brotherhood?
[110:12.70]There.
[110:12.95]How are you?
[110:13.39]Uh, hallelujah.
[110:14.23]I see the light.
[110:14.95]Give him the flyer.
[110:16.09]Mm-hmm.
[110:16.39]You got it.
[110:32.74]Save it here.
[110:33.40]Here comes a fight.
[110:34.02]I'm going to have to fight the ball.
[110:35.18]I'm going to make sure I have my blood buff initiated.
[110:42.51]And there is another car stereo.
[110:44.19]I've got to go find the guy to sell.
[110:45.91]Hey.
[110:47.89]Did you get summoned?
[110:50.05]You're going upstairs to see the bishop.
[110:56.03]Summoned.
[110:56.37]You're new to the Brotherhood, huh?
[110:59.69]Just got enlightened.
[111:01.46]I've been here a few days.
[111:05.62]I've been here for three stinking days.
[111:09.08]You'll be summoned.
[111:10.72]And then you go up these stairs up to the temple.
[111:15.48]Mm-hmm.
[111:19.23]I'm gonna kill this guy first, right?
[111:20.91]Okay, that's a little creepy.
[111:43.26]What of this torrid temple?
[111:44.94]I mean, I hear things, but I haven't been summoned.
[111:49.41]I had a friend, snuck up there a few days ago, just said she saw things, bad, bad things.
[111:57.34]Yeah.
[112:01.51]You've had your hands up for a very long time.
[112:05.36]You're taking too long.
[112:06.12]I'm sorry I asked.
[112:30.64]Shit, our early fears.
[112:32.66]Got to shit in the diaper and then be done.
[112:36.74]Rejoice!
[112:37.24]Soon you shall worship with this warlock.
[112:39.31]Farewell.
[112:40.63]Sorry I asked.
[112:53.63]You got a lot in you, don't you?
[113:00.20]Alright, get me out of here.
[113:01.02]Upstairs.
[113:03.90]I'm ready.
[113:04.22]Alright, where's the bishop?
[113:14.90]I can't talk to this guy.
[113:15.86]Okay, that guy exploded.
[113:21.60]Why did that guy explode in one hit into a thousand pieces?
[113:30.68]Is this supposed to be happening right now or am I not supposed to fight the zombies yet?
[113:38.14]I'm a little confused.
[113:48.69]There's so many of them.
[113:53.49]There's a lot of them up here.
[113:58.41]That was a sick move.
[114:01.10]This person just got annihilated.
[114:07.75]Gone.
[114:09.17]Is that a crit?
[114:11.67]I gotta be careful here.
[114:21.28]I got hit.
[114:22.26]Unbelievable.
[114:26.70]Go back to God of War, Jeremy.
[114:41.91]Am I getting experience with doing this?
[114:49.57]I do like when they instantly explode.
[114:56.76]There are a lot of you.
[115:01.12]God damn it.
[115:04.32]I'm getting stuck on the bodies on the ground.
[115:05.98]I'm... I... Oh my goodness gracious.
[115:13.66]It is a lot easier to not swing more than once.
[115:15.38]Because you get kind of locked in in the direction you're facing.
[115:18.20]It's a little awkward.
[115:20.74]How many of there are you?
[115:26.50]Brains?!
[115:29.20]They're eating my brains?!
[115:37.33]Okay.
[115:38.87]You're not dead.
[115:39.95]You are now.
[115:40.99]Are you?
[115:41.37]Yeah, maybe.
[115:44.26]I'm gonna save it.
[115:51.42]Oh shit.
[115:52.16]Put him down, put him down, put him down, put him down.
[116:00.43]I got one rat.
[116:01.15]That's all I care about.
[116:12.05]This is actually scaring the shit out of me.
[116:15.17]I don't like the fact that I'm being surrounded.
[116:17.61]At all.
[116:25.67]Someone's going to be in here, aren't they?
[116:28.25]I don't like this.
[116:33.98]Just in the walls.
[116:34.92]I really am a mouse right now.
[116:45.26]Where have we gone?
[116:45.74]I guess nowhere, really.
[116:49.44]This is just going back down.
[116:53.76]Apparently, I could have just snuck around that way?
[116:55.70]I guess?
[117:03.35]Can I sneak through here?
[117:04.63]Yes, I can.
[117:05.77]This brings me over this way.
[117:07.99]Continue the trek.
[117:08.83]Nope, I didn't do anything.
[117:17.74]I'm trying to go in every room to look for ammo.
[117:20.18]Why would I need ammo?
[117:21.60]I have a knife.
[117:22.10]I don't need ammo.
[117:23.88]None of the doors open.
[117:32.55]Okay, that's the way down.
[117:40.29]I think that's the only way I can go.
[117:44.11]So that's the way we're going.
[117:50.15]silver ring well maybe not um okay I feel like I'm in a maze am I in a maze
[118:19.53]I think I found the door.
[118:20.49]Yeah.
[118:21.05]Ah, the disease-ridden demagogue.
[118:45.48]Disease, brother, you've got to open your mind.
[118:51.09]One man's disease is another man's sanctity.
[118:55.43]Here among the brotherhood of the Ninth Circle, we have shed these earthly labels.
[119:01.40]Come, partake of our divine communion.
[119:07.70]Need I speak with you to join this gruesome gathering?
[119:09.94]The Brotherhood of the Ninth Circle of Hell.
[119:28.26]Do your days also end with the Gehenna?
[119:30.10]Gehenna?
[119:30.38]I'm gonna do Blood Buff and go 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[119:32.32]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[119:32.54]1, 2, 3.
[119:32.68]1, 2, 3.
[119:46.67]You talk of disease.
[119:48.23]What about the disease that you and I both carry?
[119:52.35]Our flesh remade into nothing more than an abomination.
[119:57.40]Feeding on our brothers and sisters like so many cattle.
[120:01.76]What God watched over me when that demon tore into my neck and made me into this monster you see before you.
[120:09.06]No, brother.
[120:11.62]There is no God who would tolerate such a thing.
[120:16.16]And so I have become God.
[120:18.32]And the diseases I carry to the masses will bring about an end of my own making.
[120:24.39]And we have all journeyed below into the ninth circle.
[120:32.42]I too wish to ride your evil wave.
[120:34.02]Oh, minister of the macabre.
[120:36.26]Perhaps this is a party best left with plague berries.
[120:38.84]I want to join you.
[120:39.52]The time for words has come and gone, my brother.
[120:43.60]You and I will take those last steps together and see what truth lies behind the curtain.
[120:50.64]Let the night fall forever on this cursed earth and let the fruits of my labor bring a long and bloody harm.
[120:56.76]I'm going to piss on you.
[120:57.84]Save.
[120:57.98]Save.
[121:04.06]He has a gun.
[121:11.69]Why do I feel like this guy has hacks?
[121:17.09]This guy is fucking hacking!
[121:19.83]What?
[121:21.63]I'm eating somebody.
[121:22.75]I'm just puking.
[121:32.81]What was I aiming at?
[121:35.19]Who's there?
[121:38.11]Who's there?
[121:38.85]Hey, who's there?
[121:42.03]Okay, here we go.
[121:43.63]Crack house.
[121:47.87]Mass hysteria.
[121:49.07]Why am I getting normal male dialogue?
[122:02.70]I think we're gonna have to do gun here.
[122:22.52]Right?
[122:27.93]This is a gun.
[122:28.49]This is a gun.
[122:29.05]This time to use the gun.
[122:57.25]I can't shoot through the bed?
[122:58.44]I haven't hit him one time.
[123:09.80]Zero.
[123:10.22]Alright, this is like the top 10 lamest fights you've ever seen.
[123:42.34]Oh, this ain't going to end well.
[123:48.36]Blood buff doesn't do anything with that.
[123:50.07]Okay, what else we got?
[123:50.97]Shotgun?
[123:51.35]I don't have any bolts in it.
[123:55.11]Do I have any bolts in the shotgun?
[123:57.03]Okay, we're going to have to be very, very good about this.
[124:05.09]So, what about... What about fists?
[124:07.85]Fists.
[124:13.76]Get this on the fucking top of Twitch TV.
[124:16.64]Epic win moment.
[125:20.92]What am I doing?
[125:21.92]What is happening?
[125:24.30]What is going on?
[125:25.20]I'm going to win.
[125:26.60]I just beat him.
[125:29.16]I just beat him.
[125:29.56]I win.
[125:30.60]Huh?
[125:32.06]Oh, don't move.
[125:45.48]Why is it loving?
[125:55.95]Um... Okay.
[125:56.11]That was, uh... I think that was way too high for me.
[125:58.77]But I ended up accidentally beating it anyways.
[126:13.80]I need some blood.
[126:15.98]Right now.
[126:26.95]Like, I need blood so bad that I might just eat somebody in the street.
[126:31.71]Like you.
[126:33.97]Or, come on, wait until this person walks by and then I'm going to eat you.
[126:49.48]I saved the game already.
[126:51.56]I saved it right when I was done.
[127:00.91]Okay, get away.
[127:02.67]I was never here.
[127:09.45]I still don't understand those hazmat suit people.
[127:12.98]Look for the bar.
[127:13.70]I did it.
[127:19.06]I completed the chain.
[127:25.25]I don't think I'm even going the right way.
[127:30.69]I don't believe I went the right way.
[127:37.61]What happened to Condemned?
[127:39.57]I beat it.
[127:40.93]I completed Condemned.
[127:42.16]We moved on to Vampire, the Masquerade, Bloodline.
[127:46.26]Nine.
[127:46.68]I went the complete wrong way.
[127:48.96]Buy a new weapon.
[127:54.90]That's true.
[127:55.46]Where's the guy that sells the weapons here?
[127:57.70]Behind this truck, right?
[127:59.23]Get out of my way, man.
[128:06.72]Fuck outta here.
[128:07.30]If you ever talk to me like that again.
[128:19.84]Eat a stripper.
[128:20.72]You're not you when you're hungry.
[128:23.62]Let's go.
[128:24.24]Got a lot of things to sell.
[128:28.28]So I've got a photo, a lockpick.
[128:33.10]No, I need that stuff.
[128:34.00]Okay, here we go.
[128:38.40]I can't use these.
[128:39.53]I have car stereos.
[128:40.63]Take all of them.
[128:41.51]Shotgun.
[128:50.34]I've got 371.
[128:52.21]Here we go.
[128:53.81]Beautiful.
[128:54.29]Fire Axe.
[128:55.67]Buy it.
[128:56.71]And I'm going to sell tonight.
[129:01.03]Yeah.
[129:01.63]See you later.
[129:03.16]Perfect.
[129:07.16]Let's get that thing equipped.
[129:12.60]Fire Axe time.
[129:16.24]Oh, I can't wait to use this.
[129:18.38]Okay.
[129:19.38]What about... Uh... What are you talking about?
[129:24.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[129:25.50]Sell me your stuff.
[129:30.46]I'm still standing... Oh, he's giving me a quest.
[129:31.96]He's giving me a quest.
[129:33.25]I wanted to check one more thing.
[129:34.55]Right in front of the cop, yeah.
[129:36.91]The cop is right there.
[129:38.03]We're both under arrest.
[129:38.97]Uh... I am your man.
[129:57.48]Find some firepower.
[130:01.26]Okay.
[130:01.62]What else does he have?
[130:04.24]No, forget the tire iron.
[130:05.76]No, you got nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[130:08.78]I can sell the ring, but who cares?
[130:09.72]38 ammo shotgun shells!
[130:11.10]How much are they?
[130:12.04]Buy it, buy it.
[130:12.52]How many of these am I buying?
[130:27.56]I just bought a lot of them.
[130:29.72]Well, I just... I bought quite a bit.
[130:34.53]Let's put it... Let's see.
[130:37.63]What did I buy?
[130:38.83]I got a lot.
[130:42.83]Okay, that's enough.
[130:44.71]Alright, let's go turn this in.
[130:48.63]Just blowing a shotgun on the street.
[130:51.81]Hey, guys.
[130:53.69]Don't mind me.
[130:58.68]We gotta get back to the bar.
[130:59.92]Almost there.
[131:04.83]Bang a left here.
[131:09.53]Buy the eggs.
[131:11.33]I don't have enough money for a dinosaur egg.
[131:16.93]I have eight experience points.
[131:19.94]Melee.
[131:20.34]I need one more.
[131:20.98]Or I could do strength.
[131:26.64]Should I just do strength?
[131:30.92]Yeah.
[131:32.08]Yeah.
[131:34.38]Yeah.
[131:36.00]That's what we're gonna do.
[131:41.88]Yeah, three humanity.
[131:46.15]Life is a living hell right now.
[131:51.67]Computer.
[131:52.73]No computer.
[131:55.05]No computer.
[132:01.38]I'm doing a min-max playthrough?
[132:02.86]No, I just want to make my melee not terrible.
[132:04.72]Alright, what is... Is this completed or is there one more thing?
[132:10.10]Is she the original plaguebearer?
[132:14.61]Find out.
[132:15.13]The king of the carrier pigeons and all of his filthy chicks are finally extinct.
[132:20.17]You killed all of them?
[132:21.75]You?
[132:23.69]So I guess you want me to thank you or something?
[132:26.69]Only one EXP.
[132:27.19]Got a new quest log.
[132:29.17]Masquerade Redemption.
[132:30.35]Maybe see you.
[132:30.89]Um, okay.
[132:57.87]The proof so that was it okay Cool cool And ladies and gentlemen with that I'm gonna save it And that is where I'm going to end the stream tonight there has been a change of plans for tomorrow I
[133:22.59]The PC build stream is going to be on Sunday, not tomorrow.
[133:25.85]I want to prepare for it.
[133:29.44]So, no stream tomorrow.
[133:32.00]It's going to happen on Sunday.
[133:35.50]And it's probably going to happen not at, like, night.
[133:38.86]It's probably going to happen more towards the day.
[133:40.70]I don't know.
[133:41.42]It might depend on when I get back.
[133:44.88]So you're saying we're playing a game tomorrow.
[133:46.86]No.
[133:49.69]It's only fair.
[133:50.31]It's not fair.
[133:50.91]It's only been five hours.
[133:51.93]Well, it's been five hours.
[133:55.29]That's usually when I stop.
[133:56.56]I stop after, like, three to six.
[133:58.12]So, Sunday evening, probably.
[134:02.58]Not, like, necessarily Sunday night.
[134:03.76]We'll see.
[134:04.10]I need a time.
[134:06.98]Sunday, like, Sunday after four.
[134:10.26]But before nine.
[134:11.56]You know.
[134:17.38]Sometime at that point.
[134:26.47]But thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[134:28.77]For you, those people that were here for seven, probably.
[134:33.89]So for those of you that stuck around for the Vampire Masquerade, thank you.
[134:39.29]That game is very fun.
[134:40.93]I did get very angry at the stealth mission.
[134:45.92]But honestly, like, look, was I a little stupid there?
[134:49.72]Sure I was.
[134:51.99]Everything before and after the stealth mission there, I loved it.
[135:02.70]I got a little salty during the stealth mission.
[135:04.64]Sometimes that happens.
[135:08.71]But thank you, everybody.
[135:11.21]Let's go through some bits that I missed from earlier.
[135:16.69]And we're going to end the stream here.
[135:19.30]The Elizabeth Dane mission sucks, don't worry.
[135:24.02]As long as, like, that's the general consensus.
[135:25.78]I never want to be, like, the asshole that's just like, this is stupid, I hate this, I'm a fucking baby.
[135:30.20]I hate getting that way.
[135:34.42]It happens sometimes.
[135:35.48]Not really.
[135:35.98]Not all the time, but sometimes.
[135:39.02]Hey, if you can't accept me at my thirst, obey your worst.
[135:44.97]But, anyways.
[135:47.25]Thank you to...
[135:50.74]But Bongo Fiesta was starting from earlier tonight, so there's probably going to be some condemned... There's probably going to be some condemned references in here, which, by the way, condemned.
[136:02.21]Two thumbs up.
[136:03.23]I can't wait to play the second one.
[136:04.65]I've never played them before.
[136:05.69]I always, like, wanted to.
[136:06.57]They always looked really interesting back when they were on, like, 360.
[136:11.81]And PS3.
[136:12.87]I didn't play them.
[136:14.53]So, I'm glad to play these games because they are fantastic.
[136:18.43]So, Condemned 2 will be in the very near future.
[136:20.77]We're going to play Hand of Fate 2 on Tuesday.
[136:24.24]And depending on how many streams that takes us, Condemned 2 will probably start next week on Friday.
[136:30.40]I'm assuming.
[136:31.02]I'm thinking.
[136:33.04]But, if you don't want to stick around for the bits, thank you so much for sticking around.
[136:36.50]Thank you, everybody.

[138:01.45]They're never getting replaced.

[138:09.34]I heard you've been talking shit about COD.
[138:12.56]1v1 me Nuketown.
[138:14.04]Quickscopes only.
[138:15.18]No last stand.
[138:19.15]Or I could just never buy another one of those games ever again.
[138:24.49]I'm not sure what it would take for me to buy another Call of Duty.
[138:27.25]The last one I think I was Black Ops 2 was the last one I really played.
[138:32.00]Or maybe... I think... Did I buy Advanced Warfare?
[138:34.51]Are they all the same game?
[138:35.83]I have no idea what the last Call of Duty I played was.
[138:39.51]They're all the same game in my brain.
[138:44.01]Here's Call of Duty.
[138:45.21]This is all I can see.
[138:46.23]I see myself turning a corner with a submachine gun and it just being like... Run!
[138:52.82]Run!
[138:53.06]Sprint!
[138:53.44]Sprint!
[138:53.66]Turn this way!
[138:55.44]Keep going!

[138:57.58]Unlock!
[138:59.04]Got it.
[138:59.38]Okay.
[138:59.78]Oh, you died.
[139:01.00]Spawn.
[139:02.38]That's all I know.
[139:03.42]There's nothing else there.
[139:05.62]There is nothing else there.
[139:07.66]It's just that corridor submachine gun.
[139:12.45]That's all I know.
[139:19.81]Anyways, thank you.
[139:21.43]But I'm probably not going to play another one ever again.
[139:26.37]It's Kronk.
[139:27.41]Thank you for the $10.
[139:28.77]I'm sorry for starting the bad Kronk meme.
[139:31.99]It's because of my name.
[139:34.47]Thank you for the $10, Kronk.
[139:36.11]Look, before I turn the stream off, what is the Kronk meme?
[139:41.68]What is it?
[139:42.32]Just somebody write it in the chat.
[139:44.30]Just give me a sentence from the meme encyclopedia.
[139:47.86]What is it called?
[139:50.30]Know your meme?
[139:52.24]What is it?
[139:57.57]I'm not going to turn the stream off until somebody tells me.
[140:02.65]Crunk.
[140:03.23]Wrong lever.
[140:04.09]Pull the lever.
[140:05.11]It's not... The Emperor's New Groove.
[140:11.03]This doesn't mean anything.
[140:11.97]I'm going to look it up right now.
[140:14.63]We're not going anywhere until I figure this out.
[140:17.53]Crunk.
[140:21.26]It is Emperor's New Groove.
[140:23.04]I knew who this was the fucking second... Hold on.
[140:25.56]Crunk.
[140:26.24]Meme.
[140:33.66]Is this the thing where the guy's putting up his hand going like, oh, this is delicious.
[140:37.52]Okay, here we go.
[140:42.68]Cronk, pull the lever, Cronk.
[140:47.53]A recent YouTube meme involving a scene from The Emperor's New School where Isma orders Cronk to pull a lever and as a running gag, a vase falls upon his head.
[140:58.63]The meme typically involves replacing the vase with another object or meme such as Will Smith.
[141:07.52]Why are you guys saying this now?
[141:08.56]I don't understand.
[141:16.59]But why say it now?
[141:23.21]Normie detected?
[141:28.32]What?
[141:28.92]Just because I don't know what the fucking Kronk meme is?
[141:44.71]Chat, what are you?
[141:46.57]Old streamer.
[141:47.61]It was just everyone saying Kronk with movie titles and it got out of hand.
[141:57.35]My fucking face hurts.
[141:58.63]Please stop this normie stream.
[142:01.23]Don't call me that.
[142:03.20]Isn't that like a bad word?
[142:06.64]Isn't that like that?
[142:07.18]Don't you not want to be called that?
[142:08.58]Doesn't that mean that you're not like smart enough to understand funny jokes or something?
[142:13.90]What does that mean?
[142:14.60]I'm looking that up now too.
[142:19.27]Normie.
[142:22.61]Noun.
[142:23.51]Informal.
[142:25.09]An ordinary or conventional person as distinguished from someone who is a member of a particular group or subculture.
[142:32.85]I need a guide for geeks struggling to buy presents for normies.
[142:36.05]The venue had a no blue jeans policy to keep out normies.
[142:42.91]What?
[142:43.49]Alright, so that's... What does that mean?
[142:51.42]You just proved I'm... I just proved I'm one of them.
[142:58.07]You guys think I'm fucking normal?
[143:03.13]Guys, I once dropped a grilled cheese sandwich down cheese side down on the ground.
[143:09.93]I picked it up and I put the top on and I still ate it.
[143:14.01]Normie?
[143:15.13]Normal?
[143:24.00]In the shower?
[143:25.88]I piss in the shower.
[143:27.32]And I pee all over my hands and I, like, use it to wash my hands with the soap.
[143:31.40]To save water.
[143:32.64]Normal?
[143:32.98]I do that all the time.
[143:47.63]Alright, let's move on.
[143:48.39]We're getting stuck here.
[143:50.76]Thank you, though.

[144:10.11]I feel like those games are great, aren't they?
[144:16.38]I feel like I should probably play Persona.
[144:21.68]But I never have.
[144:22.34]One of my college roommates was really into it and it seemed interesting.
[144:27.50]But I never played it myself.
[144:31.82]Sputnik, thank you for the $3.
[144:33.52]Dwarverine for Gerber Rumble.
[144:35.66]If I could, I would make it.
[144:36.87]I swear to God, I would.
[144:38.61]In fact, I still might.
[144:39.53]I might just be like, who cares?
[144:40.73]I might just be a guy with a fucking Wolverine costume on and a door on his back.
[144:46.27]Thank you to Molotov Bartender.
[144:49.24]Sorry, Bub.
[144:51.54]The Dwarferine doesn't apologize.

[145:20.27]Just as like a, hey, let's try to, like, fuck with this game.
[145:23.54]It's like a five hour long game or something.
[145:30.38]Keep sending him crunk memes.
[145:33.34]No.
[145:33.58]I'm going to bed.
[145:35.32]Let's get this real clear.
[145:37.46]I'm going to sleep in like nine minutes.
[145:43.70]But yeah.
[145:44.44]Fear will probably be on the menu at some point.
[145:48.20]Captain Magic, thank you for the $12.
[145:49.24]He's just calling me a tryhard.

[146:11.31]A British scientist who grew to fame by exploring her local beach for fossils, preserving them, and ultimately selling them.
[146:17.70]While she's been called the mother of archaeology, many constitutes... That word is weird because it's fucked up on Twitch alerts.
[146:26.74]Just bear with me here.
[146:28.76]Uh...
[146:30.67]Many constituents often took her credit and is largely remembered by this rhyme.
[146:35.89]For more Twitch facts, I ain't saying it.
[146:41.19]He wants me to say press 1 for more Twitch facts and then press 0 for less Twitch facts.
[146:45.39]Alright, so it was a real person.

[147:58.94]I want to do it.
[148:00.08]There's like three things I want to do.
[148:01.78]There's too many things I want to do.
[148:05.09]I need to focus on one thing and stop spreading myself out over the butter like in that Lord of the Rings movie.
[148:12.67]When Bilbo is like, I'm telling you, I'm like butter spread out over too much bread.
[148:16.07]I don't want to get like that.

[148:30.28]What has been your favorite spooky game so far?
[148:32.10]Are you talking about like in the Halloween week?
[148:35.65]I played a bunch of those dumb games Nosferatu was actually fun and entertaining and It's interesting enough that it could be like a speedrun game You have what 30 minutes to really complete the whole game I
[148:51.67]And like an hour and a half before the game is uncompletable or something, right?
[148:58.70]Probably that.
[149:00.52]Straight up scariest game I've ever played?
[149:02.20]I don't know.
[149:04.64]That's tough.
[149:08.05]Part of me wants to say Outlast 1.
[149:12.05]But if it wasn't Outlast 1...
[149:16.73]I don't know.
[149:17.55]Maybe one of those random indie games that I played years ago that just throw up awful jump scares in front of you.
[149:23.62]But it jumps... I don't know.
[149:24.70]Jump scares... Not as much scary as they are heart rate inducing.
[149:36.13]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1 stick.
[149:38.76]Thanks for the $1 stick!
[149:41.48]If I play Zumbinis, am I going to play the original or the Steam remake?
[149:45.90]I would try to get the original.
[149:48.64]Does the Steam remake change very much?
[149:54.76]Well, I'll have to investigate that, but it'll probably be the original if I can get it to work.
[149:59.68]Swasby, thanks for the $1.
[150:00.58]Does Jerma like butts?
[150:03.72]Thinking.

[150:29.97]But thank you, Dave.
[150:31.17]David the Knights.
[150:34.21]For your $15, 1500 bit donation.

[150:41.96]Take my money that you may never sleep.
[150:43.82]Steam forever in a perpetual never dying... You take the Cheeto, you eat it.
[150:50.85]What's going on here?
[150:54.49]I get so...
[150:56.37]I get my brain can't comprehend when people start writing out like poetry or or lyrics I feel like I'm about to I feel like I'm gonna Wile E. Coyote ran into a wall It's gonna be like I'm gonna read this blah blah blah here it goes here it goes there it goes And here comes something awful that I just said like it because it's a stream of words That's why I'm scared he thinks he has a brain
[151:23.34]Judgment gold.
[151:25.36]You're out.
[151:25.86]You're out of here forever.
[151:26.70]Permanent ban.
[151:28.44]Permanent ban.
[151:31.70]Gone.
[151:32.04]Forever.
[151:36.40]Can we have somebody take care of that, please?
[151:43.21]Can somebody take care of that, please?
[151:52.27]If you're new, by the way, a permanent ban is 10 seconds.
[151:58.76]Because what you don't know is your life, every tenth of a quarter of a second of your life is an entire lifetime somewhere else in the Metroidvania, in the Metroverse, you know?
[152:15.17]So 10 seconds is 95,000 eternities in the Metroidvania.
[152:29.91]I've been banned like four times.
[152:34.85]Well quit talking shit!
[152:39.54]I've been banned four times already.
[152:41.24]Well, maybe you should consider that you don't want to be banned four times.
[152:48.36]I got banned twice today.
[152:49.56]Stop getting banned!
[152:52.38]What are you guys doing?
[152:53.24]What are you writing?
[152:58.56]I missed the stream.

[153:02.62]Anyways, thank you to Dytro for the 10 bucks.
[153:06.11]Glad to see you're streaming one of my favorite games.
[153:08.05]Nosferatu for German Rumble, yeah.
[153:10.09]Or Count Chocula... Chocu Cthulhu?
[153:18.21]Well, thank you, Dytrol.
[153:20.41]The Empire of the Masquerade is a very, very interesting, fun game.
[153:24.73]I find it to be... It's a little sloppy.
[153:29.16]I'm going to come at you real.
[153:31.66]It's a little sloppy.
[153:33.92]It's rough around the edges.
[153:35.64]And sometimes you could very clearly move a car...
[153:39.97]through a doorway that somebody else is potentially standing in.
[153:44.91]And you can't.
[153:46.51]And just because there is a dresser drawer space, a moving company could go next to the person and you can't walk by them, that doesn't mean it's a bad game.
[153:59.34]It's just barely rough around the edges enough where I think it's fun and interesting and funny and cool.
[154:06.31]But thank you.
[154:08.41]uh germa's nuts again thanks for the one dollar have a good sleep germa have a good day tomorrow and be safe uh all right okay kind of a menacing donation hey have a good sleep tomorrow jeremy and be safe like oh okay I'll I'll try

[155:14.50]What are you gonna do?
[155:15.28]You're gonna dig a hole in the ground?
[155:17.96]You're gonna do what Bear Grylls did.
[155:19.46]You dig a hole in the ground, you pee in it, you cover it, and then like three days later you come back and you start like splashing it in your face.

[158:29.61]Like, 50,000 of the same character, the same comic strip.
[158:34.95]You kind of run out of material, and then it just becomes... It doesn't matter what you put out.

[160:15.82]Garfield was not a success, a wild success, until he was in his mid-thirties.
