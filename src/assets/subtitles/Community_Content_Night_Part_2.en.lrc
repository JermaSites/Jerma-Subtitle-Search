[00:16.50]Hey.
[00:20.17]Not that late.
[00:20.87]A little bit late.
[00:24.79]I just wanted to do a last minute check.
[00:28.17]I had to take auto out and then... I wanted to make sure these are all... I messed up the way the images came through.
[00:34.60]So I had to re... kind of put them in the right place.
[00:38.02]But!
[00:38.80]We're live now.
[00:39.76]How are you?
[00:41.14]Good afternoon.
[00:43.12]It is currently 212 Pacific.
[00:47.29]Don't know what time it is for you, but hopefully it's a nice time.
[00:55.93]Omega lull.
[00:57.31]Right off the bat, already got a couple of omega lulls.
[00:59.79]It's gonna be a good one tonight!
[01:02.95]Uh, yeah, we're gonna do community content night.
[01:06.87]My throat's a little scratchy.
[01:09.43]Because I've had a cold...
[01:11.72]But I've had a 20% cold for like 10 days.
[01:17.10]It won't become a cold.
[01:20.06]But it won't stop.
[01:21.78]It won't leave me alone.
[01:24.36]Maybe it's the air.
[01:30.16]I started to develop this after the slime stream.
[01:34.34]It's just like, get out of it.
[01:36.06]Give me the cold and let's get it over with.
[01:41.44]He's turning.
[01:43.82]Not yet.
[01:47.55]Not yet.
[01:47.95]We'll see.
[01:50.87]He got slime-itis.
[01:55.03]No, but again, this is the second time we're gonna be doing this.
[01:58.47]Expect this stream to be... Somewhere around...
[02:04.73]Few hours, three or four hours.
[02:06.03]This is what we're doing.
[02:06.95]Community content only.
[02:07.99]If you don't know what that is, go to the Discord.
[02:09.55]Read the pin on the community content Discord page.
[02:13.61]You can find out what we're doing.
[02:16.49]Art, videos, music.
[02:18.75]Community themed.
[02:20.95]There were a lot of submissions.
[02:25.43]Tried to go through and get as many as I could.
[02:27.78]In for today.
[02:34.34]Mmm!
[02:35.88]Alright.
[02:37.34]So let's go ahead and move over here.
[02:38.50]We're just gonna get started.
[02:41.83]Yeah, there's gonna be a cam today.
[02:43.09]I promise.
[02:45.25]Here you go.
[02:45.81]You ready?
[02:46.15]There'll be a camera today.
[02:54.56]I didn't say which one, though.
[02:57.44]This is the first one.
[02:58.52]We're gonna start with images.
[03:01.32]I don't know if that's pixel me.
[03:05.20]But here's real me.
[03:07.14]How are you?
[03:07.56]Good afternoon.
[03:09.48]So... Make that face.
[03:14.72]I did that face again.
[03:16.75]I'm never making that face again.
[03:18.13]I've done that face twice.
[03:19.95]And it has become... Just... There's a worse one.
[03:26.01]I look like it's gross in this picture too.
[03:28.35]I've talked about how this is my least favorite photo.
[03:31.82]A dozen times.
[03:36.66]Do it.
[03:37.67]Do it.
[03:38.09]No, the greedy Grinner is not worse than this.
[03:41.29]I'm going to have to put the evidence forward.
[03:42.87]This is the worst picture that exists of me with more than 100 upvotes.
[03:51.99]But this is the one we're starting with.
[03:55.17]Dermaface tier list.
[03:56.63]I can't do that.
[03:59.11]Hold on, let me just... Everybody thinks I'm gross before drinking, like, I put blood in water, whatever.
[04:08.91]Alright, let's go.
[04:10.15]This is number one.
[04:11.19]Again, I want to make this very clear.
[04:13.45]Make sure you watermark your images.
[04:15.93]It's got to be on Imgur, or it's got to be on YouTube.
[04:19.95]Put a little thing down here that says, like, Dan.
[04:24.67]You know, whoever you are.
[04:28.00]What?
[04:28.50]What did I say?
[04:30.62]Imgur.
[04:32.34]Oh, sorry.
[04:33.47]Sorry.
[04:34.39]Sorry, folks.
[04:35.75]Imgur.
[04:36.99]Imgur.
[04:38.33]That's too many things to say.
[04:40.27]Imgur.
[04:41.03]No.
[04:41.65]Imgur.
[04:43.35]It's so much easier.
[04:48.02]Even if it's wrong, I'm still going to do it.
[04:49.28]There are people that say jup instead of jup.
[04:51.66]So, am I going to change those people's minds?
[04:54.18]No.
[04:57.36]I say imgur.
[05:01.68]Fuck dumbass shithead.
[05:03.09]Oh my god.
[05:04.01]Alright, let's take a look at the next.
[05:05.95]I gotta get this image off the screen before it's like, again, the number one thing that comes up when you type in Jerma into any search.
[05:11.45]That's what it is.
[05:13.97]Alright, this is the next image coming up.
[05:16.56]Fireman.
[05:18.12]Look at this dude.
[05:19.94]Everybody loves Fireman.
[05:21.80]Of all the things, like everybody just loves this character.
[05:26.18]This is one of quite a few good Firemans tonight.
[05:31.18]He's awesome.
[05:36.34]Look at this dude.
[05:39.36]Very good fireman.
[05:40.14]I like the little rosy cheeks here.
[05:43.36]It's a nice touch.
[05:45.41]And I make that face.
[05:49.37]I do this all the time.
[05:51.23]I always have this little, like, shit-eating grin on.
[05:54.29]I just did it.
[05:54.87]Right there.
[05:57.03]Shito!
[05:57.41]Shito!
[06:00.22]I think we may have seen this one already, but it's still very good.
[06:07.23]Rest in peace, Shito.
[06:08.63]What's wrong with Shito?
[06:12.01]Shito's batteries are dead.
[06:13.89]But that's alright.
[06:18.28]How do you zoom?
[06:19.62]It's control plus, right?
[06:21.46]There we go.
[06:23.72]Um, Shido's batteries are dead, but here's the thing about, um, inanimate objects.
[06:29.50]If you put new batteries in, they just wake up.
[06:34.36]It's like going under anesthesia.
[06:36.74]They just get up.
[06:37.30]They're just up now.
[06:39.99]And nothing, they keep all their memories, everything's fine.
[06:43.83]Shido could sit in, like, a suitcase for, like, ten years, and I just put batteries in, and it's just like he opens his eyes from the last time he was turned off.
[06:49.15]And he's like, I'm fine, I'm alive, I'm fine.
[06:55.47]Wake him up.
[06:57.09]Maybe one day.
[06:59.39]That's Toy Story 5.
[07:01.01]What a great idea for a Toy Story sequel.
[07:07.12]That's fantastic.
[07:09.48]Have Woody just wake up in like 2060.
[07:13.96]And he has to deal with the future and all of his memories are from... You could do a whole future thing with that.
[07:24.52]His batteries died.
[07:25.44]Yeah, that would be perfect.
[07:26.66]I would go see that movie.
[07:31.44]The Wall-E future?
[07:32.65]No, it just had to be like a regular future.
[07:34.91]Not the Wall-E future.
[07:35.97]Guys, we're not going to get that advanced.
[07:40.43]We've plateaued, I think, in a lot of technology.
[07:43.01]It's going to take like a hundred more years before we get like a real new plateau of technology.
[07:49.51]I disagree.
[07:52.43]Alright, let's keep going.
[07:53.07]That was a Shito.
[07:54.31]Good, they watermarked.
[08:03.16]I mean, it... That's me!
[08:05.94]That is me.
[08:07.36]Although, I don't know if my, like, jaw is that.
[08:12.81]Maybe it was.
[08:15.81]When I look at some of these images, I just go, like... Is that, like, that's me?! !
[08:22.66]Man, I guess I'd look like that, huh?
[08:27.67]It's a great style, though.
[08:28.65]I love... You know what I like about this one?
[08:31.25]This part.
[08:32.33]Right down here.
[08:34.39]I love this shadow.
[08:36.03]This, like, neon shadow.
[08:39.63]I love what you did with the chin.
[08:41.66]Because that's the extent of the amount of hair that I can grow on my face.
[08:45.70]You nailed it.
[08:52.21]don't have enough gamer neck I don't want to be gamer I don't need gamer neck for this I can sit like that and that's what my look at my throat that's my throat looks like too like bumpy and up looking I've okay I am such a bumpy person like what you see right here is what it looks like the whole way down I'm just like coming to like little like bumps and like loose skin I do not look good naked
[09:25.08]No, who am I kidding?
[09:25.70]Yeah, I do.
[09:29.43]No, not like a toad.
[09:31.63]Maybe it is kind of... No, it is like a toad.
[09:35.07]No, it's not.
[09:35.69]Let's find out.
[09:36.39]Okay, what if I show you... Okay, is it... No, that's illegal.
[09:39.61]I can't do that.
[09:41.55]I was just like, let me show you.
[09:43.51]That would be really bad.
[09:44.35]What do you think about this?
[09:49.08]Illegal.
[09:51.88]No, I'm really, like, bumpy and, like, coarse.
[09:57.76]Like, when you touch my arm, it's like sandpaper.
[10:00.58]It's like, ah, fuck, that's, like, that's rough.
[10:07.61]I like this image, though, a lot.
[10:09.13]It's very good.
[10:10.25]Very, very good.
[10:10.79]Give me the watermark.
[10:14.65]Streamer, well, there it is.
[10:15.95]Streamer goes insane.
[10:22.14]I like this one here.
[10:26.92]I don't even have to do anything.
[10:29.34]It's already there.
[10:31.86]Look at that.
[10:32.20]Look at my stomach line, too.
[10:34.49]That is what it looks like.
[10:39.87]What is that?
[10:45.39]The old toothbrush.
[10:46.21]I remember this one.
[10:50.57]That's the fart face?
[10:53.05]This is the fart face, isn't it?
[10:54.85]And of course, beanbag Sonic.
[10:58.34]I like the blue and the blue.
[11:00.36]That ties the whole thing together.
[11:01.48]They pop, and then you add a little bit of green over here.
[11:06.11]Which your eye goes like this.
[11:07.49]This is how this works, guys.
[11:08.97]Trust me, I know art.
[11:11.11]Your eye, the artist decided to put the colors popping out like this, so your eye goes like this.
[11:17.06]See what I just did?
[11:18.16]Oh, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[11:19.14]Right there.
[11:19.92]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[11:20.82]Right there.
[11:22.56]Your eye is one, two, three, four points across the paper.
[11:25.81]Why don't you ask the artist?
[11:33.70]See?
[11:35.25]Like, they're here right now.
[11:36.29]Yeah, that's why I did that.
[11:38.93]It's a good composition.
[11:39.77]I like it.
[11:41.13]Very good.
[11:41.93]A lot of moments.
[11:42.77]A lot of, like, Twitter picture.
[11:48.17]I don't think that that many people are going to like that photo.
[11:52.72]But they did.
[11:55.72]The chin's not big enough.
[11:57.00]It's huge right here.
[12:00.18]like my nose is like right outside and then my chin like touches the top of my nose like for a minute if you took a ruler and go like this it'll hit the bottom of my chin see because it comes out far like a banana there isn't a ruler long enough get out of here rude
[12:31.28]Alright, there's a way for this one.
[12:33.04]Ready?
[12:34.67]So this is just watch it.
[12:38.75]Ready?
[12:40.39]Let's add the bottom teeth.
[12:44.17]Two submissions here.
[12:45.37]One of the top row and then finishing it with the bottom row.
[12:52.11]You got to complete the photo.
[12:55.01]My teeth don't like that.
[13:00.46]Imagine you had teeth like that.
[13:03.58]Your mouth would just be constantly bleeding.
[13:06.22]Blood would just be pouring out of your mouth at all times.
[13:09.70]It would just be like... Blood would just be filling your mouth and you'd just have to spit.
[13:15.29]You'd have to carry... You'd have to carry one of these around and like... You'd have to keep your mouth closed like this.
[13:22.47]And talk through here.
[13:29.21]Otherwise you'd just get hurt.
[13:33.11]Blood Bottle.
[13:36.05]It's tea.
[13:37.21]It's tea.
[13:37.49]I'm drinking tea.
[13:38.35]But no, I like these two because the second submission has the bottom teeth.
[13:43.03]It's like, oh fuck, I forgot the bottom row of teeth!
[13:46.31]Alright, I got it now.
[13:47.47]It's there now.
[13:51.28]Let's keep going.
[13:53.14]This is when I won the Vine Wrestle.
[13:58.92]It's the belt right there.
[14:01.96]You'd have to wear a mouth guard.
[14:03.24]Yeah.
[14:03.68]You'd just have to have like a constant mouth guard on.
[14:07.77]CM Jerm.
[14:11.59]That was a lot of fun.
[14:12.73]I was happy to participate.
[14:13.97]It was a great day.
[14:17.07]This Glue Man.
[14:18.33]Who is this?
[14:19.75]What actual character is this?
[14:25.70]I don't know who that is.
[14:28.18]What's the actual wrestler?
[14:31.40]It's Glue Man.
[14:32.28]No, behind the mask.
[14:36.35]It's the dude.
[14:36.99]It's just a dude next to CM Punk.
[14:40.39]That's not a wrestler.
[14:40.97]This is like a fan?
[14:45.85]Wait, is this somebody just getting in the photo?
[14:48.59]Like leaning in?
[14:49.58]How would they be here?
[14:53.12]They were just in the crowd.
[14:55.12]Oh, I thought this was like two wrestlers.
[15:00.40]Whatever.
[15:02.10]Oh, wait, this is awesome!
[15:03.08]I forgot, this is like the Jupiter Storm.
[15:04.52]I should have, I, I didn't, I wouldn't.
[15:06.74]Let's just sit here for a minute.
[15:07.70]This is great.
[15:11.13]So this is, uh, Jupiter Storm.
[15:14.05]A little screensaver.
[15:15.51]I think it's great.
[15:18.29]You know what would be really awesome?
[15:19.69]Is if whoever made this, whoever programmed this, to make it so it would count the Jupiters that are happening in chat, how many completed ones happen, and that's the ones that rain down.
[15:31.77]That would be awesome.
[15:33.59]Oh, there's also gnomes here, but who cares about those?
[15:36.72]We can remove those.
[15:42.14]Chad is feeding them back to the sky.
[15:46.90]But yeah, this is really cool.
[15:50.16]It's just like a little screensaver.
[15:51.36]I think it's random too.
[15:53.46]Seems like it is.
[15:54.04]Let's see.
[15:54.86]Is it random?
[15:57.54]They're just kind of... Yeah, I think it is.
[15:59.78]Different distances and stuff.
[16:02.29]No, it's not.
[16:02.87]Are you sure?
[16:03.23]I don't know about that.
[16:06.39]Let's see if that happens again.
[16:08.15]No, it is absolutely just wherever they go.
[16:11.91]See?
[16:12.21]Look at that.
[16:13.99]Here they come.
[16:14.49]See?
[16:15.65]They go down at the bottom and then they start at the top.
[16:18.83]Watch the gnomes.
[16:23.10]Why do I feel like if I sit here for long enough it's going to scream at me?
[16:29.52]I don't think it is.
[16:33.30]It's just gonna go like... It's really cool, though.
[16:40.41]This is a photo of a photo that somebody did, I think, in a class or something.
[16:46.25]Green light means go.
[16:48.69]It's me T-posing and then T-posing Jays.
[16:56.05]It's a classroom meme?
[16:58.97]Are you passing this, like, around in class?
[17:02.75]Don't get me in trouble.
[17:04.43]Don't get yourself in trouble.
[17:06.80]This better, you better turn that over and there better be flashcards behind there.
[17:11.98]I, I, I, this, don't, I don't want to get you in trouble.
[17:19.10]Don't get me in trouble.
[17:22.41]Oh, there's a flashcard, alright.
[17:23.65]There's a flash, alright.
[17:25.41]Why would you say that?
[17:27.78]pretty cool uh classroom you can tell look at the thumb there's like the thumb on the corner right here just like with like a phone like a camera phone right here right there the second you took that photo you probably just got yelled at it was like Steven yeah what are you doing no no just uh flash cards don't get me in trouble
[18:03.28]I've been seeing this a lot lately.
[18:05.98]The lion from Madagascar.
[18:08.84]It does that thing.
[18:13.23]That... I mean, I don't know.
[18:15.47]Did I steal it from Madagascar?
[18:18.51]I don't think I did.
[18:19.27]I've never even seen this movie, though.
[18:23.31]I didn't see this movie.
[18:25.45]I've never seen Madagascar.
[18:27.53]Does he actually go like this?
[18:30.82]Like...
[18:31.61]Bang!
[18:32.09]I don't think he does.
[18:36.91]Does he?
[18:39.40]I've never seen this movie.
[18:42.06]Maybe it was only in the background one day.
[18:44.40]No, I refuse to believe that I stole content from the lion Ben Stiller character in Madagascar.
[18:52.40]I refuse to think that.
[18:56.61]I refuse!
[18:59.09]No, like, my, like, father used to do this.
[19:01.55]Like, this is my dad.
[19:02.77]He would be like, oh, look at me.
[19:05.36]I don't, I don't do that.
[19:06.76]I gotta say, I gotta see it.
[19:09.16]I gotta see it.
[19:13.94]I think we've seen this already, but this is crazy.
[19:16.48]This is from The Simpsons Hit and Run stream.
[19:21.04]It's terrifying.
[19:25.02]Like, they're melting and
[19:27.98]it's scary but it's really really well done yeah this is a thumbnail for one of the videos yeah this is the second Jerm of thumbnail that's why I was like I know I've seen this before it's crazy it's good stuff
[19:51.41]Yeah, look at how this is as a thumbnail.
[19:54.27]You can still make up pretty much everything.
[19:56.06]That's how you know a thumbnail's good.
[19:57.90]When it's this small and you can still tell everything that's going on.
[20:03.42]Excellent work.
[20:05.42]Excellent work!
[20:08.10]Just like you.
[20:13.33]Hey, Carnival!
[20:15.79]Carnival, uh, Jerma.
[20:18.07]I love the fact that you put a watermark on it.
[20:21.87]There's the million dollars in bits.
[20:25.49]Frog.
[20:27.27]Just a well-composed fun image.
[20:29.07]Do you remember I lied about Wailord?
[20:31.73]You sure about that?
[20:34.95]Wait, where is he?
[20:38.05]I don't know where he is.
[20:39.07]I think he was being cleaned.
[20:40.99]He's not here.
[20:43.87]Whatever.
[20:46.59]Usually he's just sitting right here in this chair.
[20:49.33]But not right now.
[20:50.91]You lied.
[20:51.51]No, this is great.
[20:55.07]I like the teeth here.
[20:56.31]I like the crumpled up car run over hat.
[21:00.81]Looks good.
[21:03.01]Very, very, very, very good job.
[21:04.43]Just all around good shit.
[21:07.49]Here's Jex Mix.
[21:10.19]New bald coin marshmallows.
[21:15.15]Low sugar, that's what I'd like to see.
[21:16.69]I would eat this.
[21:24.31]What's the flavor though?
[21:26.51]Marshmallows?
[21:27.41]Chocolate?
[21:29.40]Just is it like Cheerios?
[21:32.08]Kind of like Chex?
[21:33.66]I actually don't like, I think Chex are gross.
[21:35.84]So, I wouldn't want these to be Chex flavored because I find them to be absolutely abhorrent.
[21:43.92]Don't give me that look.
[21:45.94]How, how, no, no, no, excuse me.
[21:48.50]You guys don't just leave all the Chex in the Chex mix.
[21:53.70]Just remove the Chex from the Chex mix and you have, like, a really great snack.
[21:59.91]I don't eat the Chex.
[22:00.79]I eat around the Chex.
[22:02.97]Even the ones that are cheese flavored.
[22:04.53]No, I don't, they're gross.
[22:06.89]They're just, like, too crunchy and they just taste like, like, just pure wheat.
[22:12.25]Mm-mm.
[22:15.10]You eat the pretzels.
[22:16.36]You eat the fake Cheetos.
[22:18.89]Because heaven forbid we call them real Cheetos.
[22:20.95]And you eat the fake Cheez-It triangles.
[22:24.55]And the rings.
[22:25.35]And the rings.
[22:25.87]And the little flat bread pieces.
[22:28.69]And the little weird gross white puff balls.
[22:32.02]I'll take those over Chex.
[22:33.74]Don't eat any of the Chex.
[22:39.54]The rye bits.
[22:43.74]He's insane.
[22:44.80]Because I don't like Chex?
[22:49.36]He hates good snacks.
[22:51.67]There's no way that this many people like Chex.
[22:55.05]I don't think that's real.
[22:56.91]I think I'm getting, like, messed with here.
[23:01.31]Do you eat Chex in, like, milk, too?
[23:05.71]Because, like, I'm about to, like, we're going to be going, like, a thousand miles per hour, if that's true.
[23:12.25]I'm not seeing a whole lot of no's.
[23:14.41]I cannot believe this.
[23:19.57]Checks are good as fuck.
[23:20.73]Checks are amazing.
[23:21.99]This has to be a generational thing.
[23:28.50]Am I actually not in the majority when I say that I don't like checks?
[23:32.76]I can't believe this.
[23:35.97]No, like, the old people eat Chex.
[23:38.27]You guys call everybody boomers here.
[23:41.01]Old people eat the fuck out of those things.
[23:43.15]It's like their favorite snack.
[23:44.83]They've been around for 150 years.
[23:47.39]You're the real boomer.
[23:50.20]Chex.
[23:52.04]Ugh, even the word.
[23:52.88]I just think of it.
[23:57.80]This is called Streamer.
[23:59.42]Is this like Doom?
[24:04.58]Old people eat wheat thins.
[24:05.88]Yeah, you probably eat those too.
[24:09.80]I'm the real Zoomer.
[24:11.14]I eat like Lucky Charms, Gatorade, and Beyond Burgers.
[24:20.57]That's all I eat.
[24:26.11]This is really good though.
[24:33.62]You eat plastic bottles?
[24:37.46]There's no- what do you mean pla- there's no plastic in Lucky Charms.
[24:41.30]It might be a little bit of rat shit, but that's FDA regulated.
[24:44.64]Uh, this is great.
[24:55.23]So this is- I'm like a Doom character?
[24:57.25]What?
[24:57.43]Is this in Doom?
[24:58.75]What's the globe?
[25:03.10]Ratchet is fine if it's regulated.
[25:06.91]Don't make me do the you eat over an inch of dirt every meal thing again.
[25:10.67]I will.
[25:16.01]I'll do it.
[25:17.41]And people will be very upset with me.
[25:19.71]Here he goes.
[25:20.89]Just pretend I said it.
[25:23.07]You eat over an inch of dirt at every single meal you eat.
[25:26.08]Every single meal you eat over an inch of dirt.
[25:29.36]I don't know how people don't understand that.
[25:31.54]When you're sitting at a dining room table...
[25:36.10]He did it.
[25:36.50]He did it.
[25:37.06]He actually did it.
[25:39.76]This is awesome.
[25:44.52]Question marks don't get it.
[25:45.86]Think about it.
[25:46.93]That's on you.
[25:52.25]Streamer.
[25:56.11]Very good image.
[25:57.55]I like the aesthetic.
[25:59.71]What is that image even of?
[26:01.29]I think it's from green screen.
[26:04.16]Ooh, look!
[26:05.60]There's Wailord.
[26:10.97]How much of an inch of dirt is in grass?
[26:12.35]You eat food off of the grass.
[26:15.37]So if you made a sandwich right now, you'd put it down on the grass before you ate it.
[26:18.95]What are you talking about?
[26:26.85]I like the color back here.
[26:32.76]I'm talking to one person here.
[26:34.22]One person said they eat, like, on the grass.
[26:38.54]I forget that there's, like, 4,000, 5,000 people here.
[26:41.38]I'm talking to one person.
[26:48.73]What?
[26:51.13]Uh, Wailord?
[26:52.61]I like the face here.
[26:54.99]This is really good.
[26:59.04]I think that really captures me.
[27:07.04]Flat and then like, it's very good.
[27:11.98]I don't know how people draw.
[27:15.52]You have to have a ton of patience to really actually sit there and do all this.
[27:21.18]because I will get to the first stage the first step of drawing and you start like blocking out what you want and then it's all wrong my legs are too big and it's like I have to I've made them like these big parachute legs and then you erase it but then I screwed it all up so I don't even want to do it again I have a lot of respect for people that can do shit like this that can draw and design it's very very very very very cool
[27:49.28]Just draw for thousands of hours.
[27:51.48]Yeah, that's kind of how you do it.
[27:54.42]People are very, very talented in their craft.
[27:59.32]And everybody draws differently, too.
[28:02.82]That's, like, the best part.
[28:05.54]This is really cute.
[28:07.66]I'm liking it.
[28:08.42]Nice.
[28:11.65]This is kind of how, like, a dog will look at you.
[28:13.83]You know what I mean?
[28:15.23]If you're like, hey, like, hey, Otto!
[28:16.69]And he's like, like, huh?
[28:20.04]Like, come over here.
[28:21.82]This is a very, like, dog looking over at something that they're interested in.
[28:25.79]The side eye.
[28:28.27]Yeah, the dog side eye.
[28:29.49]Let's get in a little closer.
[28:39.75]God, rats are awesome.
[28:41.57]I wish I could just actually pull the trigger and actually get a rat.
[28:45.09]Two rats.
[28:46.19]Always get two.
[28:47.28]I just think
[28:49.81]I was gonna get a lizard before a rat.
[28:52.03]Can you guys believe that?
[28:54.63]I was gonna get a big ass lizard before I got a rat.
[29:00.70]It's tricky.
[29:03.90]Lizards are good too, I know.
[29:09.69]No, not an iguana.
[29:12.19]What if I just got like a huge monitor lizard?
[29:18.51]They need a whole room in your house, by the way.
[29:23.09]They need... It's like having, like, a guest just there permanently.
[29:27.77]Like, in a bedroom.
[29:29.16]They have to have their own room.
[29:31.02]Imagine having a fucking, like, lizard live in your house.
[29:36.00]So it's like a kid.
[29:36.80]Yeah.
[29:42.90]They are so cool, though.
[29:44.12]And they're not, like, mean, either.
[29:46.14]Some of them can be.
[29:47.92]But there are some monitor lizards that are just, they don't give a shit about anything.
[29:51.97]They're like, are you feeding me?
[29:53.61]I guess you and I are really good friends.
[29:57.79]Get a, I can have a lizard roommate.
[30:02.45]Maybe the lizard roommate will stream too.
[30:06.94]Give its own office.
[30:11.18]That would be fucking crazy.
[30:13.22]Nah, too much.
[30:14.22]Too big.
[30:15.98]Maybe one day.
[30:17.88]Maybe one day.
[30:19.08]But I do want a lizard, though.
[30:20.02]I want, like, a bearded dragon.
[30:22.44]Just like a... I want a bearded dragon that's at least as big as my head.
[30:27.50]As big as, like, my hand all the way down my arm.
[30:32.55]But that's, like, I don't know.
[30:33.47]Maybe.
[30:33.77]Maybe, like, another time.
[30:34.63]I don't know.
[30:36.25]Great photo, though.
[30:37.55]Great pic.
[30:45.49]You guys nail eyes, can I just say?
[30:54.67]I don't even know how you do that.
[31:01.15]I do like that you have the fact that there's two earbuds in.
[31:08.34]I know what shirt this is.
[31:09.28]This is the Aquaman shirt.
[31:12.66]I know what stream this is from.
[31:13.96]Let's get in a little closer.
[31:19.35]See the real detail here.
[31:25.91]I like the shine here.
[31:27.29]Nice shine on the hair.
[31:28.55]Because that's for real.
[31:31.51]See?
[31:32.44]You've got that little shine coloring coming in.
[31:37.36]That's not turning white, is it?
[31:44.41]No, it's not.
[31:46.81]Is it white?
[31:48.75]No, it's just like a lighter blonde, right?
[31:51.57]Uh-oh.
[31:52.93]I look in the mirror every single day.
[31:54.29]It's just the way that the lights hit in my face.
[31:57.45]I think.
[32:01.23]Cover the eyes and it looks like the TF2 soldier.
[32:09.23]It kind of does.
[32:19.71]It kind of does.
[32:21.42]That's pretty cool.
[32:23.32]That sentry.
[32:25.12]Get a haircut.
[32:27.26]You guys act like my hair is down to my ankles.
[32:33.56]It's not that long.
[32:35.76]It's like not down to here.
[32:38.56]It's just like a normal hair.
[32:40.06]No, I like it.
[32:44.91]It's staying.
[32:47.17]I'm going to grow it on my face too.
[32:49.13]No, I would never do that.
[32:53.37]This is, I remember this one.
[32:54.57]This is somebody did.
[32:55.57]This is from playing Jackbox, I think.
[32:59.69]And this is what they were able to do in the drawing game.
[33:04.01]Dr. Swiss Cheese getting papers from Dr. Rat.
[33:08.29]You have like a tiny little cube to work with in Jackbox.
[33:11.46]How do you even make a fucking volcano?
[33:14.84]Don't you only have like 40 seconds to draw this stuff?
[33:20.62]It seems very hard to do this.
[33:25.58]dreamy live streamer caption Twitch streamer what do you have a 43 inch tablet this is drawception not jackbox right okay blue guy with fedora this is Jerma Neptune does that emote still exist did I delete that emote I haven't seen that emote in a long time oh it's jermaEgg right right right
[33:53.34]I feel like that's even what I never see anymore.
[33:57.23]Get rid of it.
[33:59.91]This is great, though.
[34:01.97]Classy Egg.
[34:05.15]You can't remember his own lore?
[34:07.53]I know my own lore, but that was... What do you mean I don't know my own lore?
[34:10.31]That is Jerma Neptune, but it was just so bad that I just uploaded it and called it an egg.
[34:15.75]That is the lore.
[34:16.41]That's my own lore.
[34:17.19]I know my own lore.
[34:17.93]I know my own channel.
[34:20.05]That is Jerma Neptune.
[34:27.06]Let's keep going.
[34:29.96]This one scares me a little.
[34:31.34]This one freaks me out.
[34:35.87]It's Lil Jerma, number one clown streamer.
[34:39.65]It's just like, this is like, unsettles me.
[34:44.25]This is for Halloween, it seems.
[34:45.77]Like, the last few weeks.
[34:47.25]Pretty relevant.
[34:48.87]Apparently I am a rat puppet.
[34:53.01]But it freaks me out because...
[34:55.61]This is typically what I wear when I stream.
[34:58.85]Except maybe like shorts.
[35:01.15]Or the other way around.
[35:02.25]This is like, it's too real for me.
[35:08.81]Including a diaper.
[35:09.61]That's not a diaper.
[35:10.89]That's a pair of underwear.
[35:14.72]That's not a diaper.
[35:16.48]I get like, yeah, I get huge hands.
[35:21.58]That's not a diaper.
[35:22.32]That is a pair of underwear.
[35:28.41]Yeah, those are tighty-whities.
[35:30.19]There's a difference.
[35:31.45]Not very much of a difference, but there is.
[35:37.82]Tighty-whities really are just thin diapers.
[35:42.92]I don't wear tighty-whities.
[35:48.27]Nope.
[35:48.81]Sorry.
[35:49.75]Not on this guy.
[35:53.97]I don't wear tighty-whities.
[35:56.64]actually there was one time where Kim and I I think we're we're on vacation somewhere I don't I think it was she came to whether it was e3 a couple years ago I remember what it was but I ran out of underwear on the trip and it was like I just have to get underwear let's just stop at like a random store I don't remember what the store was but I got a package
[36:21.88]I got a package of just tighty-whitey default underwear and they were huge even though they were my size and they just they would like cartoon tighty-whitey underwear and I remember just her laughing hysterically at me because I just had on this tighty-whities and I walked out of like the hotel bathroom and like brushing my teeth I Just looked like a fucking idiot
[36:47.64]And they were just, like, bulky and all.
[36:49.76]They really probably looked like a diaper.
[36:53.34]It wasn't the underwear she was laughing at.
[36:55.07]Oh, alright.
[36:58.33]I see what you're doing here.
[37:01.39]Nice.
[37:06.93]You bastard.
[37:10.41]Ban that person for life.
[37:13.15]But yeah, I don't like just tighty-whitey underwear.
[37:17.00]And they always show people in commercials wearing them.
[37:20.52]There's this weird propaganda campaign with like shitty default just tighty-whitey underwear where they show these like huge handsome like Chad guys wearing them.
[37:31.71]Nobody wears those.
[37:33.65]Nobody buys those.
[37:38.09]It's like tighty-whitey commercials are like the Switch commercials.
[37:44.24]Like, it's the equivalent of having like a big strong Chad guy in tighty-whities in front of a camera is the same thing of having a party on the roof with like 30 people all hovered around one switch.
[38:00.61]So, I don't know who's buying it.
[38:05.19]Not me.
[38:06.35]Not anymore.
[38:06.97]Not after that trip.
[38:09.29]Box of briefs of where it's at?
[38:10.55]Absolutely.
[38:11.89]Yes.
[38:18.17]You only buy tighty-wighty underwear, in my opinion, in like an emergency like that.
[38:23.31]That's like emergency ration underwear.
[38:26.81]Not for any other purpose.
[38:28.56]And it does what it's supposed to do.
[38:32.00]But anyways, this photo is very, very good, but it's very creepy.
[38:34.64]Like, who are these people up here?
[38:39.80]Are these supposed to be you guys?
[38:42.68]But you guys are in here.
[38:44.75]Why are you in my house?
[38:47.96]It's creepy, but it's very well made.
[38:51.86]Nice job.
[38:55.14]I didn't mean to put this one up.
[38:57.56]I must have stayed.
[39:00.94]This is me as the Joker.
[39:09.81]Alright, okay, when I go through all these images, like, there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them, right?
[39:15.45]Sometimes I save a bunch, I put, like, a bunch of tabs up, and I go, like, what do I want to put that here?
[39:19.43]Maybe we'll put that over here.
[39:21.09]That's a good image.
[39:22.17]And then I go, maybe this one, too, maybe.
[39:23.43]And, like, I have, like, a bunch of them that I kind of roughly go through them all and, like, kind of condense them.
[39:30.07]I mean, it's good.
[39:31.03]It's good.
[39:33.55]But I'm not going to have this as an emote.
[39:39.75]No, you know why I'm not going to have this as an emote?
[39:41.95]Because when this is small enough, it's just the Joker.
[39:47.21]When this is at like 10%, that's just the Joker.
[39:50.37]That's not me.
[39:54.45]That's just Joaquin Phoenix.
[39:58.85]It's still you.
[39:59.82]No, but that's not as small as it's going to be.
[40:02.24]It's going to be like 50% smaller than that.
[40:07.14]No, I'm not the Joker.
[40:10.06]I'm the Riddler.
[40:10.78]Get it right.
[40:16.95]Something, something.
[40:17.73]Something, something.
[40:18.43]Jim Carrey.
[40:19.13]Something, something.
[40:19.65]It's because it was Jim Carrey.
[40:20.75]I'm not going to do that face anymore.
[40:25.17]I already said I wasn't going to do it.
[40:30.82]I love riding the frog.
[40:31.70]This is awesome.
[40:39.12]What is it...
[40:42.16]I like, I just like this.
[40:46.06]It's Frog in the Park 2.
[40:50.97]Tell us a riddle.
[40:54.13]Did you know, Batman?
[40:55.99]Did you know that you eat over two inches of dirt every single meal?
[41:01.75]What are you talking about, Riddler?
[41:03.68]Well, if you can't get it, then I'm sorry, Batman.
[41:09.06]That's where you die.
[41:16.86]Good photo.
[41:20.24]How is that a riddle?
[41:24.82]That's a riddle.
[41:28.17]It's a puzzle.
[41:30.11]It's a puzzle joke.
[41:31.43]It's a joke puzzle.
[41:34.21]That's a riddle.
[41:34.91]You have to think about it.
[41:35.81]A joke is a riddle.
[41:36.83]A joke just is a riddle that's a humorous riddle.
[41:39.91]That's why you have to... What are you talking about?
[41:42.54]A joke is a humorous riddle.
[41:49.19]Oh, God, did you think you know comedy?
[41:50.79]You think you know comedy, Batman?
[41:52.15]It's a humorous riddle.
[42:03.38]Oh, my God.
[42:05.30]I'm sorry, chat.
[42:07.24]Yeah, I might as well get off camera and just play this.
[42:11.98]This is actually pretty good.
[42:17.10]That wasn't a joke or a riddle.
[42:23.15]How is a joke not a riddle?
[42:26.28]You set up a punchline that the people don't know what it is until you tell them.
[42:32.74]Three guys walk into a bar.
[42:34.54]One sits down and asks a question.
[42:36.28]It's just a long, drawn-out punchline.
[42:38.34]The punchline is the solution to the riddle.
[42:45.23]You don't know the answer to that until you hear it.
[42:51.39]Come on.
[42:55.05]It's a question that you don't have the answer to.
[42:58.01]Until it's given to you by the fucking master puzzle creator of the joke.
[43:12.30]So you are the Joker, not the Riddler.
[43:15.28]They live in the same house!
[43:16.60]They live in the same house!
[43:17.62]Who cares?
[43:20.33]Oh god.
[43:26.92]They all share like it's the same fucking flat.
[43:33.24]The best part about this one is this is this is me kissing Kim.
[43:41.37]that she took a picture of and they omitted it and it's just me there's an image floating around of somebody I don't know if we showed it before of me kissing myself with different clothes and different hair and it's really really fucking weird but Kim is supposed to be here so this just looks really strange
[44:16.57]This is called Mini... Mini... No, that's Mini Man.
[44:21.73]Instead of Gemini Man.
[44:27.15]You motherfucker.
[44:33.65]Gemini Man.
[44:35.37]Oh, you're embarrassing me now.
[44:38.18]What is this?
[44:38.58]Oh, is this it?
[44:41.06]Hold on.
[44:43.24]I need to put this on camera.
[44:44.40]This is fucked up.
[44:47.72]Oh, this is so fucking weird, man.
[44:52.12]Hold on.
[44:52.77]Let me get this on camera.
[45:20.47]It's just so.
[45:23.71]It's because we're making the same face.
[45:30.11]What an egomaniac.
[45:32.95]I didn't make this riddle.
[45:33.89]Let's move on.
[45:50.17]disgusting it's the same like and look I know everyone I got criticized for that image let me go back I got criticized for this image because I I'm yes I know I look like a corpse I look like like somebody in a casket okay I understand that but the photo was taken the photo was taken
[46:17.26]right when like we first started kissing and it was just like oh it started there you know I mean like I look like I look like I'm just asleep I look like I'm sleeping another one I'm not clicking it this is community that is community content you're right it's this is community content that's correct
[46:44.51]Click it.
[46:44.81]No, hold on.
[46:45.99]We can't just get stuck.
[46:47.91]We got like another three hours of footage.
[46:50.52]We haven't even got to the video section.
[47:01.57]Alright, whatever.
[47:02.71]What is...
[47:13.62]alright that's it that's it that's it okay that was good let's move on this is uh I like this is almost like clay like I've made it like uh it's been molded out of clay
[47:48.15]I need Dead Rising today.
[47:49.17]I already beat it.
[47:50.51]I beat Dead Rising all the way through.
[47:52.19]We're going to start Dead Rising 2.
[48:01.44]Don't say tomorrow.
[48:07.01]Hold on.
[48:07.59]No, no.
[48:13.91]I don't know.

[48:47.25]I uh over the next couple days there's gonna be a new channel that gets opened up in the Discord what do you think it's gonna be it is going to be green screen DLC for free discussion over the next like probably probably like in a couple days it'll be up there and then that stream green screen DLC for free will be probably in like two or three weeks
[49:19.16]And then for the next community content night, we're going to see what you come up with.
[49:24.80]But that'll be probably in two or three weeks from now.
[49:30.98]But this is great.
[49:32.98]I like the background of this one.
[49:36.54]Was this brush?
[49:39.40]Take a look down here.
[49:40.48]This is brush stroke, right?
[49:45.85]Looks like it.
[49:51.64]I like when, like, the canvas shows up in the background.
[49:56.02]You can see.
[49:56.52]Because then it adds, like, you got the white, and then you got, like, the maroon, and then you got, like, the face.
[50:01.71]It's really, really good.
[50:03.47]Excellent work.
[50:10.35]Here's the... Look at those yellow teeth.
[50:14.81]There's the egg.
[50:19.22]This is unbelievable.
[50:25.25]Yolk teeth.
[50:28.49]Nice work.
[50:31.35]You captured his essence very well.
[50:33.83]This is kind of how he is.
[50:35.34]All day.
[50:37.86]And there's blood in his mouth.
[50:40.24]Yeah, because look at how sharp his teeth are.
[50:41.76]We went over this already.
[50:46.66]Now what are you guys linking?
[50:50.93]Nice job.
[50:53.07]We haven't seen very much egg.
[50:55.46]He's been in two videos ever.
[50:57.48]So, why would we ever see him again?
[51:01.46]Click the link.
[51:02.20]Hold on.
[51:04.00]I'm in the middle of something.
[51:14.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:16.43]That's not real, right?
[51:18.57]That's not real, is it?
[51:20.73]No, that's not real.
[51:22.65]Is that real?
[51:23.27]That's not good.
[51:24.25]What the fuck?
[51:30.41]God damn it.
[51:41.72]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[51:44.00]How long do those stay there for?
[51:47.38]How long does it stay up like that?
[51:50.29]Oh my god damn it.
[51:51.89]Okay, well excellent work on the egg.
[52:03.17]It's gone now.
[52:05.11]Imagine seeing that shit.
[52:08.67]There's, uh, Jerma Myers.
[52:14.05]So we're gonna get a lot of Halloween-themed ones, because Halloween was, like, two weeks ago, so... It's still there.
[52:24.42]That thumbnail is so bad!
[52:26.48]Because it's a just-chatting...
[52:30.05]And it's somebody with their webcam in the corner.
[52:33.83]Which is obviously the person that's in the photo.
[52:36.95]Reacting to them, like, hooking up with themselves.
[52:41.22]That's not, that's fucking bad.
[52:45.38]You scroll right by that.
[52:47.64]And you don't even click, you go, no, no, no.
[52:55.20]God damn it.
[52:57.66]This is good.
[52:58.52]I like how it's the mask is what it is.
[53:01.76]Like, that's not even what I look like under there.
[53:09.03]Nice touch.
[53:09.49]Do you remember how it actually looks like unmasked Mike Myers?
[53:16.09]I don't.
[53:19.33]Wait, I don't even know.
[53:19.83]What does unmasked Mike Myers look like?
[53:23.99]I mean, true.
[53:29.00]There's been like 30 Halloween movies.
[53:31.42]I don't know which one.
[53:32.23]I've only seen like 10 minutes of two of them.
[53:38.11]This is really good though.
[53:46.66]This image will haunt me forever.
[53:48.76]This is like, okay.
[53:50.94]You know those cursed videos that you can watch?
[53:53.81]And it's like, don't watch this video.
[53:55.89]You'll get cursed if you watch it for more than 10 seconds.
[53:58.29]There have been reports of people who have watched this video and then they died.
[54:02.85]Like, that's what this is.
[54:06.93]Don't watch, don't look at this for more than 10 seconds.
[54:14.63]actually it's like this is like actually scary I feel like it's moving look at it for a while no no no no no next one next one because I don't want it to be on the thumbnail for the live thumbnail that's a huge clear image of like a gross face I've made but let's go back and look at it one more time so it's not the thumbnail okay
[54:46.65]I always thought that hair was probably the hardest thing to do.
[54:51.09]All you artists out there.
[54:52.77]Nice job.
[54:54.08]Love the watermark.
[54:57.50]Hair seems impossible.
[55:02.66]Every strand.
[55:04.26]Do you have to do every strand?
[55:05.78]I have a crooked nose.
[55:08.84]Yeah.
[55:09.18]What about it?
[55:16.15]I have a crooked nose.
[55:20.51]I got hit, I got hit in the face when I, when I was like fucking 12 on a trampoline.
[55:24.45]I jumped on a trampoline and I landed on my back and my knees, I landed with my knees up and my knees came back and hit me right in the fucking face.
[55:30.56]And it like, for life.
[55:33.96]And then I got hit with a baseball.
[55:36.64]Like right here.
[55:39.30]And then I got hit with a recycling bin.
[55:41.18]Right here.
[55:44.55]And then I fell down some stairs and, like, bumped it hard.
[55:49.85]How did you get in the face of the recycling bin?
[55:51.67]I was taking out the recycling and I was flipping it around.
[55:58.44]I was, like, doing, like, flips with it because I was fucking 13 and stupid.
[56:01.82]It was a garbage truck accident.
[56:12.97]And it's like a water, you remember the water bottle thing where it's like, I'm gonna try to flip it so it like lands on its, like this!
[56:20.12]Right, imagine you doing that with something that's 20 times as big.
[56:23.86]And like throwing it up in the air and trying to catch it in your mouth like a popcorn kernel.
[56:36.71]When you're a kid, things seem like they're fun and interesting.
[56:41.78]They're dangerous.
[56:42.28]Don't do those things.
[56:45.30]Oh, it's going to be the thumbnail.
[56:46.04]It's going to be the thumbnail.
[56:49.26]Not anymore.
[56:51.14]Says the guy that's probably done enough stupid shit even in the last, like, two years on this stream.
[56:57.45]You can't ignore this forever.
[56:58.71]Oh, I can and I will.
[57:01.55]I can and I will.
[57:04.81]No, it's not.
[57:05.47]Is it the thumbnail?
[57:07.55]It's not the thumbnail.
[57:08.47]Stop it!
[57:17.80]I have to- I'm in the middle of something.
[57:19.32]Alright, I gotta- I gotta go.
[57:21.14]I thought that was auto.
[57:22.88]That's not even fucking real.
[57:24.84]What?
[57:27.62]This is fake.
[57:28.58]This is a fake image.
[57:33.58]This didn't just happen.
[57:44.19]Okay.
[57:45.01]Goodbye.
[57:46.09]Goodbye.
[57:46.51]A lot of steaks.
[57:55.04]Wait, what category is this supposed to be in?
[57:57.28]Why are there like steaks and like stews?
[58:01.33]Chill your mind in the dishwasher.
[58:07.28]What the fuck is this stream?
[58:10.58]And is it still live?
[58:13.12]Because if it is, I hope it is.
[58:18.23]Chill your mind in the dishwasher.
[58:20.13]What a great stream.
[58:31.03]Oh my god, that's funny.
[58:33.31]Alright.
[58:34.91]If they're still alive, give them a follow.
[58:38.29]Barbecue smoked brisket and lamb?
[58:40.14]Holy shit, these channels seem fucking cool.
[58:47.80]I should watch all these.
[58:48.74]Alright, let's go.
[58:55.36]This is a compilation of work from Gen 2.
[58:59.68]You can't see them because I'm in the way, so let me get out of the way for a second so you can see the watermark.
[59:02.78]Good watermark!
[59:03.86]Excellent watermark!
[59:11.28]The thumbnail is the face.
[59:12.54]Whatever.
[59:15.44]So here is a compilation of things they did.
[59:19.22]I like the rat.
[59:19.86]Let's get in close so you can see these, so you can see them all.
[59:23.03]There's a really nice render of Baldcoin.
[59:27.88]I like that one.
[59:28.64]Here's, uh... Does that mean, like, vaping?
[59:38.40]Pumpkin... What is that?
[59:39.60]Is it like a tray?
[59:40.98]Like a dinner tray or something?
[59:43.78]Like a keychain?
[59:44.88]It looks awesome.
[59:48.77]Chill your mind.
[59:56.03]Yeah, I mean, I would rather have...
[59:59.27]You guys know this already.
[60:00.35]I would rather have a coffee and fried chicken with like... I really would rather eat this meal.
[60:05.22]This meal is way better than this.
[60:10.33]Steak and... No.
[60:11.79]This is a better meal for me.
[60:14.09]Say the line.
[60:14.71]I can't.
[60:15.59]Otherwise, we won't get over it.
[60:20.36]There's coffee here.
[60:22.44]There's fried chicken here.
[60:24.45]And there's also a puffy snack that's Cheetos.
[60:34.47]Coffee.
[60:36.51]No, no, we've moved on.
[60:37.95]We've moved on.
[60:44.63]Hold on.
[60:45.11]Okay.
[60:46.31]They're gone.
[60:47.83]This is cool, though.
[60:48.57]I want to do this.
[60:49.96]Let's see if I can find one.
[60:52.10]Compact word search.
[60:55.42]There's coffee right there.
[60:58.58]There's coffee.
[60:59.27]There's Cheetos.
[61:02.21]There's coffee.
[61:02.91]Cheetos.
[61:03.09]Cheetos.
[61:11.51]And there's coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[61:13.55]There it is.
[61:15.05]Got it.
[61:15.29]Okay, I want to find JermaCraft.
[61:20.71]Right there.
[61:21.27]Got it.
[61:22.79]How about Pea Pants?
[61:27.99]Pea?
[61:28.33]No.
[61:29.42]Can you go diagonal?
[61:34.16]Pea Pants.
[61:34.86]There it is.
[61:37.30]Nice.
[61:37.94]Got it.
[61:39.56]He's going all out.
[61:40.38]No, just enough.
[61:43.40]There's a nice, uh, rat painting.
[61:47.96]Click here for your free iPod Touch 5.
[61:50.15]There's a fake ad on this page.
[61:56.41]What the fuck?
[61:59.69]These are great, though.
[62:01.53]I like the compilation.
[62:03.93]Click it.
[62:05.21]It doesn't do anything.
[62:09.20]Okay, it doesn't work.
[62:10.78]It's an image, guys.
[62:11.58]It's not a website.
[62:13.98]I'm clicking.
[62:14.58]Do you not hear?
[62:28.51]See?
[62:31.36]That's fake.
[62:32.44]What?
[62:34.24]Let's keep going.
[62:37.62]This mouse sucks, though.
[62:38.64]Don't ever buy this.
[62:41.37]Like, I'm gonna give you, like, anti.
[62:43.07]Don't, um, just don't buy this.
[62:44.42]Ever.
[62:46.30]Let's keep going.
[62:48.08]Oh, JoJo's Bazaar Adventure!
[62:52.20]Gerber 5'8".
[62:54.50]Featuring the haunt single QRS.
[62:57.96]Rat Records 598.
[62:59.32]This is a nice touch.
[63:00.63]This is hard to emulate.
[63:03.07]What you have to do here is you have to actually get a photo of this with that price on it.
[63:07.15]Because that font doesn't exist.
[63:09.57]And you have to doctor it up.
[63:10.77]And then you've got to make it a little dirty.
[63:13.55]This was some work.
[63:18.18]It's just a pose.
[63:19.76]No, I'm talking about the price up here.
[63:22.36]That's hard to emulate that.
[63:23.72]That's like the exact font.
[63:26.20]I'm sorry, when I go to like fontditty.org, whatever the hell it's called.
[63:32.20]They don't have grocery store price tag font.
[63:40.16]That took work.
[63:45.34]Font Diddy Kong.
[63:48.32]Featuring the hot single QRS.
[63:50.16]This is great.
[63:50.71]I like how it's a little washed out here at the bottom.
[63:54.31]Excellent job.
[63:55.39]And you've got a watermark.
[63:59.91]Nice job, Colt.
[64:02.91]Good stuff.
[64:06.09]Very well edited.
[64:08.95]This is great.
[64:09.37]It's like those bar photos, bar posters for random events.
[64:11.70]One night only.
[64:33.37]This is a great photo.
[64:35.74]This would be great on a wall.
[64:40.10]Make this a poster.
[64:41.14]Make this a poster.
[64:42.90]Make it a shirt.
[64:47.74]Make it a poster.
[64:52.21]This is so good.
[64:54.37]Make it both.
[64:55.03]Make it a coffee mug.
[64:56.49]There's too many things.
[64:58.75]Make more merch.
[64:59.67]Merchandise, merchandise, merchandise, merchandise.
[65:06.18]I would consider purchasing this.
[65:08.04]Holy shit, this is like unanimously, oh my god, you guys want to buy this?
[65:16.97]Merchandise.
[65:18.15]Hold on, wait, hold on.
[65:20.55]Just hold on to that.
[65:25.17]Make this an emote.
[65:30.28]This doesn't work as an emote.
[65:37.33]Pay the art.
[65:38.01]No, if I was going to do this for like a poster, they would get a majority of the money.
[65:47.89]What?
[65:54.43]51%.
[65:54.91]That's still a majority. 50.1%.
[66:07.10]technically still a majority.
[66:11.11]No, I'm fucking kidding.
[66:14.15]Or is he?
[66:18.51]Pay them an exposure.
[66:29.94]We'll figure this out, because there's also...
[66:32.98]There's also, like... People have made stuff in this community.
[66:37.34]Like Fireman.
[66:38.80]Like this type of stuff.
[66:41.40]I would want to do that right.
[66:43.00]You know what I mean?
[66:44.02]I really don't want to just be like, Oh, thanks for the image!
[66:46.94]Yoink!
[66:48.60]No, it's a poster!
[66:49.52]Thanks for the money!
[66:51.64]Actually, we've talked about it once or twice.
[66:53.81]About doing another shirt.
[66:55.11]Doing, like, community shirts.
[66:57.45]But I would want to make sure that it was...
[67:01.08]like fair I would want the person that actually made it to be happy with it and happy with what they got and but that's a process though that's not just as simple as one two three I would want that to be them to be happy regulations just make this a hoodie
[67:24.79]But there's another thing too here is, I mean, let's get real.
[67:27.65]Ready?
[67:27.95]Let's get real.
[67:28.81]No more riddles, okay?
[67:29.91]Like, forget about the riddles.
[67:35.47]When you take stuff from the community, for instance, like this, you end up... It's like there's been hundreds of images that have come through that people were like, oh, wow, that was awesome.
[67:47.19]That was really great.
[67:49.20]But one of them's a shirt.
[67:50.31]It's like, well, mine, what was wrong with mine?
[67:52.81]What was wrong with that one?
[67:53.49]What was wrong with that one?
[67:54.09]We should have that one and that one.
[67:55.39]You have to, I just, you have to be careful.
[67:57.47]Just because I never want to have anybody think like, oh, well, this one was the shirt because it was the fucking best.
[68:03.03]Yours wasn't any good.
[68:06.34]I, it can get a little weird sometimes.
[68:11.20]No one cares about that.
[68:13.24]I know, but still.
[68:14.72]It would have to be something that we unanimously thought was a good idea.
[68:20.83]Because I don't want anybody to think that their images or their art, as great or incredible as it was, is in a competition for a t-shirt or for a poster or something.
[68:31.83]You know what I'm saying?
[68:33.91]It would just be as simple as, it just happened this way.
[68:38.26]I don't want this to ever be a competition of who makes the best art.
[68:42.94]That's not the point.
[68:44.85]And if something like this, if that ever ended up happening for some reason, it's not because this is the best image that ever was put through.
[68:52.01]It's because it just happened that way.
[68:56.75]You know what I'm saying?
[68:58.31]No, you know what I'm saying?
[68:58.95]You know what I'm saying?
[68:59.75]He did it.
[69:00.89]Slot fucking slime him.
[69:02.14]He did it.
[69:05.68]We'll see, though.
[69:06.66]I'm open to it.
[69:07.84]But I would want it to be done right.
[69:09.14]I'd want it to be fair to whoever was given the image.
[69:11.82]And I would want it to be the right thing that we all thought was a good idea.
[69:14.73]Okay?
[69:15.45]Alright, back to the riddles.
[69:20.26]I don't know if this is supposed to be in this.
[69:23.96]What, am I getting like a Windows update?

[69:45.07]How does somebody already have that ready to go?
[69:49.28]No, not everything is merch.
[69:50.82]There's a good potential fun emote, though.
[69:53.68]I need emotes, too.
[69:57.72]Jerma, but it's me.
[69:58.78]Jerm yourself.
[70:00.87]Is this supposed to be like a fake Snapchat filter?
[70:05.81]What is this?
[70:10.94]So this is a fake Snapchat filter thing.
[70:13.72]It's me at the DMV?
[70:20.28]I included it.
[70:22.26]I've been looking at a lot of images.
[70:26.48]Jerma, but it's me, Jerm yourself.
[70:28.58]This is like a take on the like Snapchat, like, look, look at me.

[72:05.97]You know what's going to be like interesting?

[72:20.71]There's going to be like Twitch stream college classes.
[72:24.65]And they're going to look, I'm going to be in a book somewhere.

[72:42.66]What?
[72:45.78]I was the first person to ever sing on stream.
[72:49.07]That happened in like 2011.
[72:59.07]I was the first person.
[73:01.88]I was the first person to get in a rowboat and row down a river on stream.
[73:06.92]Remember we went over the waterfall and I was like, holy shit, that's like 400 feet drop.
[73:11.45]And I like, I went down, it was like, what?
[73:14.13]And I was like, holy fuck.
[73:15.85]The camera panned back and it showed me going all the way down the waterfall.
[73:18.99]And then like I bursted out of the water like a shampoo commercial.
[73:21.69]And it was like, and it was like, everyone freaked the fuck out.
[73:26.66]I was the first person to do that.

[83:30.21]The pressure, the trajectory of the fingers going into the cheek.
[83:36.61]The wrinkling.
[83:40.51]This is some, like, renaissance style.
[83:42.93]Like, old school paintings of people.

[85:18.06]Um... But there was a reason why oh shit was so funny.
[85:28.05]It wasn't just somebody said oh shit.
[85:30.19]It was every single character had a different way that they said it and they all said it.
[85:36.44]That's well-structured original riddles.

[88:50.95]McChicken.
[88:52.77]Turbo Raptor.
[88:53.49]I'm not sure what that is.
[88:56.07]I think that's just in the game.
[89:00.86]There's a rat.
[89:01.96]Turbo Venus.
[89:05.36]Of course, we've got the poses.

[89:39.17]There's somebody's doodle of Um Jammer Lammy from that stream.
[89:42.99]Pretty good.
[89:45.38]I like the fact that it's just a folded next part of your scrapbook there.
[89:53.52]I need to make a face like this because that's like a really good image to have for a planet.
[89:59.74]Pretty good, uh, pretty good Lammy.
[90:05.64]Floating in outer space.
[90:08.80]Lamy emote.

[90:12.36]When it gets that small, you can just see.
[90:13.53]It's just a piece of paper at that point.
[90:15.73]Jerma notebook.
[90:19.85]Good shit.
[90:22.03]This is the quote, a senior yearbook quote.
[90:27.76]I was taken out of context for this one, but we'll read it anyways.
[90:31.35]He says, keep your eyes on the prize.
[90:33.50]The road to success is always under construction.
[90:36.00]Pretty fucking goddamn good if you ask me.
[90:38.36]Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.
[90:42.24]That's what my mother used to say to me.
[90:44.02]That's a quote from my mother.
[90:46.42]You, what are you, why are you going to make fun of my mother?
[90:48.98]Are you making fun of my mother?
[90:50.21]Mrs. Elbertson, huh?
[90:53.03]I didn't say end quote.
[90:57.17]That'd be a really, really strange quote.
[91:02.47]I don't think that would be... I think there's like a Twitter amount of characters you can have in your senior quote.
[91:10.41]It's like under 150 characters.
[91:14.46]I don't think this one would fly.
[91:19.20]And then here we go.
[91:20.92]Remember the last time we had somebody give an interesting Imgur gallery of their created characters from Soul Calibur?
[91:29.43]They have some more.
[91:31.20]So this first one is Grandpa.
[91:35.14]Grandpa entered the ring with a kendo stick.
[91:36.82]His doctor said to not participate due to heart problems, but fuck that.
[91:40.48]Watch out for this crazy old bastard.
[91:44.22]Pretty good.
[91:46.44]There's the ringmaster.
[91:49.92]Straight from the carnival comes the victim of chat abuse himself.
[91:52.72]He had to change from his Glue Man shirt to his night sky shirt after a dunk tank issue.
[91:57.67]He's weak against wind type and frog type.
[92:01.17]That wind was nuts.
[92:04.95]I'm surprised that half of this stuff is even in the game.
[92:09.33]Can you bring in custom images into Soul Calibur VI?
[92:15.84]You can?
[92:16.28]No.
[92:22.94]So how did you do the planets here?
[92:26.14]They're very clearly these planets right there.
[92:31.02]Or is it like a son?
[92:33.13]Is that just really, really good replacement of something?
[92:37.87]It was kind of hard, but they're all sons.
[92:39.57]Oh, alright.
[92:42.91]That's still really cool, though.
[92:44.89]There's Demon Grandpa from Jerma Rumble Live, and he's the scythe.
[92:49.77]That's awesome.
[92:51.67]Oh, there's a Louie Anderson.
[92:57.08]Is it just Nightmare?
[93:00.18]There's Jex.
[93:09.92]Can you tell I like that shirt?
[93:13.51]No.
[93:16.81]That's pretty close too.
[93:21.21]Jeremy Louie.
[93:22.99]Holy shit, he's here.
[93:25.03]He's here right now.
[93:26.41]There's the egg.
[93:28.50]Everybody loves the egg.
[93:32.51]The egg, the egg has, okay.
[93:33.83]You know when like a character steals the show, but they were a cameo and they were on screen for like only like three minutes.
[93:41.96]It's like the egg has like a collective like 0.0002% screen time.
[93:50.44]But people just love him.
[93:54.06]He's great.
[93:54.83]This is good.
[93:56.87]Jermacraft.
[94:02.96]That's so... That's so... Works perfectly.
[94:08.85]It's perfect.
[94:16.33]Here comes the coffee pasta.
[94:17.95]Of course.
[94:19.05]I wouldn't have it any other way.
[94:24.04]And then here is HHH.
[94:26.72]The Headless... The Horseless Headless Horsemann.
[94:30.28]From TF2.
[94:33.87]There's, uh, Turtimus.
[94:37.47]You even got the, like, the cage right.
[94:43.51]Do I, I really should probably play this game for like an hour.
[94:46.85]Just to play it.
[94:48.35]There's a 30s milkman.
[94:50.34]There's Star.
[94:51.52]He ain't that jacked.
[94:53.92]He's not that jacked.
[94:56.04]Look at that arm.
[95:01.78]Shrink that another, like, 30%.
[95:05.65]Unrealistic.
[95:09.27]Demon Lord Xeroxos.
[95:11.61]With the... You got the sweater.
[95:14.85]Oh my god.
[95:16.03]The apple.
[95:20.51]It's just a turtle shell.
[95:24.73]But it works.
[95:26.41]See, the mind of a character creator.
[95:29.09]You got it.
[95:30.74]You make those sacrifices.
[95:32.08]You make those compromises to figure out how to get the character to work on camera.
[95:35.78]Good fucking work.
[95:40.54]Seriously.
[95:41.10]This is like, yup.
[95:42.36]You get it.
[95:43.86]Oh, you get it.
[95:47.06]Pinwheel.

[96:31.75]There's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[96:34.26]And you fight with a ring.
[96:35.40]Of course you do.
[96:36.98]Super Jex.
[96:39.96]Super Jex is just barely bigger and stronger than Star.
[96:48.29]These are all so good.
[96:49.41]And then, of course, I don't think you can watermark Soul Calibur characters, but these were made by Gnarly62.
[96:54.79]Good shit.
[96:59.95]These were fantastic.
[97:03.08]That's my favorite.
[97:04.46]Just shows what you're willing to be able to do.
[97:07.68]To get what you want.
[97:09.26]On screen.
[97:11.48]The Apple.
[97:13.80]Alright, let's keep going.
[97:16.69]WWE Superstar Roman Reigns reviews wrestling scenes in movies.
[97:20.89]Vanity Fair.
[97:29.13]Oh, there's context to this one.
[97:31.71]I think my bitrate dropped to like 500 one day.
[97:36.79]And then somebody posted this image.
[97:38.66]And everybody thought it was real.
[97:53.80]It was.
[97:54.77]What do I mean it was?
[97:58.58]This is not a real image.
[98:02.68]This one's real, yeah.
[98:03.92]Because I remember looking over at chat and everyone was like, your bitrate is fucked.
[98:09.35]But this one is a edit.
[98:14.05]Get this on a mug.
[98:19.63]Good stuff.
[98:21.81]Oh, here's the official from Apple Shift.
[98:27.23]I think we looked at this the other day, but we'll look at it again.
[98:29.89]This is from 2K20, I think.
[98:34.27]Pretty accurate.
[98:36.10]Let me set up a little bit here.
[98:47.32]Good stuff.
[98:49.36]That beautiful hair, too.
[98:51.14]It's almost as good as mine.
[98:54.62]Mine's... Okay, that's the full tire.
[98:57.34]Mine's like the flat tire.
[98:58.56]But it's the same.
[98:59.58]It's the same tire.
[99:00.76]That one has a little more air in it.
[99:10.21]What is this?
[99:13.41]Is this a picture of a snake?
[99:20.62]I think it's supposed to be me.
[99:25.24]Is that my eyes?
[99:25.97]I think that's me.
[99:36.27]You don't remember the snake.
[99:42.17]No.
[99:42.81]We already have this as an emote.
[99:44.67]This is somebody made the emote in real life.
[99:49.07]This is Bogdanoff, Germany.
[99:53.02]Good shit.
[99:55.54]Me as the Joker again.
[100:04.85]And it's that same image.
[100:06.25]I can see it from a mile away.
[100:07.74]You can always tell because of the eye.
[100:10.68]one eye goes right completely forward the other guy the other one guy goes this way one guy okay one eye is normal the other eye is buried into the socket and going this way I can always tell when it's in that image you know which one I'm talking about oh and like the whole face too it's pretty good though nice stuff I I've had this movie spoiled for me
[100:40.00]That's not good.
[100:42.60]And Shito!
[100:47.40]Very good Shito.
[100:50.45]Very clean.
[100:51.19]A very clean Shito.
[100:57.53]A happy face with a little sheen on the top.
[100:59.93]It's beautiful.
[101:03.01]It is beautiful.
[101:07.14]It's got good lighting.
[101:07.88]Yeah, it does.
[101:10.43]Good shading.
[101:14.97]Give me a watermark.
[101:16.15]Give me a watermark down here.
[101:17.93]Gotta give me that watermark.
[101:21.07]Otherwise, I otherwise like who made this?
[101:23.85]Could be anybody.
[101:25.70]Give me that watermark.
[101:28.18]Up here down here right here just right there small and I'm going to zoom in you'll see it.
[101:32.44]It's fucking fantastic.
[101:35.50]It's fantastic.
[101:41.41]love it I love this one too this is with pencil I pencil smudges and doesn't it you do you use cloth with when you do this I can imagine okay hear me out on this when you are drawing something doesn't matter what it is if you have pencil pen
[102:11.56]When I, okay, let's say I draw a circle or even if I'm writing like a check or something, you write out whatever it is you're writing and then there has to be more done to what you're doing and you put like your hand and arm on the paper and you like lift up and like your sweat from your arm has ruined the picture and like smudged it and smeared the ink and smeared the graphite and how do you, how do you do stuff this detailed without like resting your like whole fucking body on the table?
[102:43.02]It must be so difficult to do that.
[102:44.50]Because think about it.
[102:46.44]Let's say you were working right here, right?
[102:50.24]You have this whole area down here that could be smudged by your hand and wrist and arm.
[102:57.00]You put paper under your hand.
[102:58.15]Do you really just put a towel or a paper or something underneath?
[103:02.15]You paper on top of the drawing.
[103:04.67]And then you kind of slide it down while you work.
[103:09.65]That's cool.
[103:10.07]They wear a hazmat suit.
[103:13.60]That's cool.
[103:15.18]You're drawing.
[103:15.76]Why are you sweating?
[103:18.88]I've run hot.
[103:22.00]I'm one of those people, and you're going to know what I mean when I talk about this.
[103:27.17]You know when you are in the car, like let's say you pick up somebody, or you're, you know, it has to be fairly cold for this to work too.
[103:35.26]So I'm the person that gets in the car during like a 40, 50 degree day.
[103:40.62]And after about five minutes, the windows start to fog because I'm in the car.
[103:46.78]It happens every fucking time.
[103:53.30]That happens to me.
[103:54.16]Good.
[103:54.70]Right.
[103:57.34]And I know it's me.
[103:59.82]But you don't say anything.
[104:01.42]What if I go, oh, sorry, guys.
[104:02.95]I have like the internal temperature of fucking Thanksgiving turkey.
[104:07.77]Sorry.
[104:10.27]I just see the corners start to fog up because I got in the car.
[104:15.72]And then I just sit there and I go, oh, whatever.
[104:18.92]I'm just in your car.
[104:20.95]And they know, because there's two other people here.
[104:22.99]There's two other people in the backseat.
[104:25.07]And the car was not fogged up.
[104:27.07]I got in, closed the door.
[104:28.23]Windows erupt.
[104:28.79]Let's go.
[104:29.15]Here we go.
[104:29.96]We're going down the road.
[104:31.18]Fog.
[104:31.60]Well, that's weird.
[104:35.26]This didn't happen for any other reason.
[104:37.84]Just open a window.
[104:38.50]Yeah, and you crack... No, but if you crack the window, if I go... Just so it goes down like a half an inch.
[104:46.12]And let out all the fucking human steam.
[104:49.34]Everybody knows that I did that.
[104:53.36]Why do you think I'm always naked?
[104:57.42]Well, Trevor, that's a little weird that you never have clothes on when you're streaming.
[105:01.21]Yeah, because I weigh like a thousand degrees.
[105:08.21]And that's right, I said weigh.
[105:10.19]Because it's heavy.
[105:11.38]Heavy.
[105:14.08]Anyways, if I were to draw this, I would lift up and this would look all nice.
[105:19.72]And this would be as if it was like a three-year-old with watercolors, just smearing their hand all over the paper.
[105:30.90]I'm just, I run hot.
[105:37.04]He's melting.
[105:40.46]What did you do in your art minor?
[105:44.62]I don't know.
[105:45.18]I got a bunch of clay and hit it with a baseball bat 20 times.
[105:54.01]And then I gave it eyes.
[105:55.95]And a mouth.
[105:57.35]And it was just like... Another face.
[106:00.23]Great.
[106:00.89]I just saw that happen in real time.
[106:06.37]I forget that people can just press the button.
[106:12.28]I always forget that.
[106:13.38]That, like, yeah, this is live.
[106:15.10]Remember, I grew up with, like, TiVo was, like, a thing that just came out.
[106:21.12]I was, like, 18.
[106:22.95]I was, like, probably 20 when TiVo was, like, a thing that first came out.
[106:31.25]Click on the link.
[106:32.75]Never.
[106:34.07]I'll never click on the link.
[106:37.77]Look at how awesome this is.
[106:40.45]This is somebody made a plush toy of that dude, Fireman.
[106:52.80]Merch, merch, sell it, sell it, sell it, sell it.
[106:56.42]You can't just sell everything.
[106:58.50]I can't just sell everything, guys.
[107:03.92]You can't.
[107:04.52]No.
[107:05.61]No, I don't.
[107:07.01]No, no, no.
[107:08.07]I'm not going corporate.
[107:17.65]Had to apply.
[107:18.19]Not going corporate.
[107:24.51]You're the greedy grinner.
[107:29.91]Alright, fine.
[107:31.07]We're going corporate.
[107:34.75]This is fantastic though, seriously.
[107:36.89]It's just... Love went into this.
[107:41.86]You can tell.
[107:45.90]Very, very good job.
[107:48.53]And we are all currently looking at him.
[108:00.26]Something's gonna be bopping real soon.
[108:06.54]And, like, I'm weirdly drinking that.
[108:08.60]Because, like, I know you're watching me.
[108:10.42]It's the same thing like being on the date.
[108:12.46]Like, I know you're watching me drink this, so I'm like...
[108:24.35]Get this on BTTV.
[108:26.28]This is not mine.
[108:28.90]I didn't make this.
[108:31.22]And none of you made this either.
[108:39.41]Just yoink it.
[108:40.19]Ain't nobody gonna yoink this.
[108:43.17]No.
[108:45.07]This ain't mine.
[108:49.05]I didn't make this.
[108:50.09]Yeah, nobody did.
[108:54.86]That's really cool, though.
[109:01.33]Boom.
[109:06.33]There's the bee.
[109:10.27]If no one made it, then you can claim that it's yours.
[109:12.36]That's not how that works.
[109:13.24]I like how jacked I am.
[109:22.10]Sometimes I think about how big and strong I used to be.
[109:25.92]And I go, damn.
[109:28.48]Imagine if I was like that still.
[109:29.76]And then I go, no.
[109:30.56]Because that took like five days a week.
[109:33.54]Every single fucking week.
[109:36.02]Constant, constant care.
[109:39.09]Every day.
[109:41.61]For like two or three hours a day.
[109:45.37]It takes a lot.
[109:46.13]Especially when you're my size.
[109:47.87]And I don't mean that as like a...
[109:50.68]I mean that as like a, when you're like under like 5'10", when you're like 5'8", 5'9", and below, it's hard to keep on fucking like 160, 170 pounds.
[110:03.56]It's hard to do that.
[110:08.89]Especially when you have metabolism like I do.
[110:11.67]Those of you guys that are under 6 feet, like under 5'10", 5'11", and you have like fast metabolisms,
[110:21.10]Putting weight on is impossible.
[110:24.60]It was a full-time job for me to keep an extra 25 pounds on.
[110:30.43]Damn.
[110:36.39]Just eat, forehead.
[110:38.92]Oh, I did.
[110:39.40]I was eating tuna out of the can.
[110:45.70]Just right out of the can.
[110:48.56]Just as a snack in between meals.
[110:51.69]like a fucking cat I just turn upside down onto a plate and I would eat it or I wouldn't I would just open it and eat it out of the fucking can that's nasty I did what I had to do to get strong
[111:21.25]You know how much protein?
[111:23.35]I'm looking you right in the eye.
[111:24.33]Do you know how much protein is packed in tuna fish?
[111:28.73]Sir or ma'am?
[111:35.91]You look pretty full right now.
[111:37.89]I do not.
[111:38.25]I've lost.
[111:38.71]I have lost like 20 pounds since 2012.
[111:40.40]I was like 170.
[111:48.15]In like 2012.
[111:50.15]I was a fucking cement brick of a fucking man.
[111:55.81]Seriously.
[111:56.47]I was just made out of cement.
[112:03.02]And then I just, you know, stopped.
[112:06.42]I started going less and less.
[112:09.12]My priorities started changing.
[112:11.22]Sorry, I just bumped you.
[112:12.02]Sorry, I bumped you again.
[112:12.78]Now he's a little squishy.
[112:15.25]Yeah, you get a little older too and it gets harder to do.
[112:21.60]Contrary to popular belief, I think, once you cross like 30, 35 years old, it's kind of hard to, at least for me, it was hard to like get to the gym like four days a week, five days a week and like lift.
[112:36.55]I just was like, it's like kind of not what I want to do right now.
[112:43.21]Jesus, you're old.
[112:43.83]I thought you were 32.
[112:46.41]Keep thinking that.
[112:49.35]Now, we'll be 32 up here for a long time.
[112:52.96]Down here, though, from here down, it's like a turtle shell.
[112:58.19]As long as I just keep a fucking long-sleeved shirt on and a turtleneck on.
[113:04.11]I'll be good.
[113:11.56]Excuses.
[113:15.78]Hold on a minute.
[113:16.33]Hold on.
[113:17.15]Let me drink the rest of my water and cigarette ashes.
[113:26.00]He's fragile now.
[113:26.74]He is.
[113:28.68]I'm not going to tell you that I'm not.
[113:31.46]Here's an album, apparently, that I am.
[113:34.55]Elbertson, the debut album.
[113:38.79]Did you take this from eBay?
[113:40.97]This is an eBay photo.
[113:46.15]Right?
[113:46.52]This is an eBay photo that you yoinked.
[113:54.75]I mean, this is like pretty good, like editing wise.
[113:59.84]Parental advisory.
[114:01.22]Oh, I can't listen to that.
[114:03.98]No, he's just saying yoink now.
[114:09.44]I don't think it's edited.
[114:11.64]What are you talking?
[114:13.50]No, no, of course not.
[114:16.98]It's, wait, it's printed.
[114:18.04]Somebody printed this.
[114:18.90]No, they didn't.
[114:36.26]Did you?
[114:38.40]It's printed.
[114:41.70]Well, let's hear it.
[114:42.70]What's in there?
[114:43.36]What's the CD?
[114:49.43]And there it is.
[114:50.37]The first album I ever did, apparently.
[114:58.75]Something of a scientist.
[115:03.86]Nice.
[115:04.22]Ooh, look at this.
[115:09.89]Lots of Fireman stuff.
[115:11.43]I love it.
[115:12.83]Now this in particular.
[115:16.89]We got one guy in there.
[115:18.53]Got the slug.
[115:22.38]What else is in here?
[115:23.82]He got the watermark.
[115:25.88]Beautiful.
[115:29.24]This is great too.
[115:29.94]What else is in here?
[115:32.88]My favorite emote is in here.
[115:38.80]That emote will never be deleted.
[115:43.72]Chomp.
[115:45.80]There's the Saturn.
[115:48.24]All neatly packed into Fireman's face.
[115:53.74]Fantastic.
[115:59.34]Very good with the
[116:02.51]switching between I'm not even going to pretend like I'm going to like talk about how what I think it looks good I make myself probably sound stupider and stupider the more that I talk about the the line work it just looks great
[116:21.78]But I like what you did with the white on the outside.
[116:25.88]It really makes it come out of the... It separates it from the paper enough where it almost looks like a 3D image.
[116:33.28]You said my piece.
[116:34.49]You got an A. This is me scared.
[116:41.89]He's an art major.
[116:46.65]Why does Jex have to be like three inches taller than me?
[116:51.07]That's not fair.
[116:52.03]We're the same person.
[116:54.16]If anything, Jex should be smaller.
[116:56.26]Because Jex is like a spirit that comes out of me.
[117:01.28]And goes in and out.
[117:02.68]Shouldn't they be like a spirit that's like smaller?
[117:10.87]What do you mean stand?
[117:16.45]He's stronger.
[117:17.13]Stand.
[117:18.77]Stand.
[117:22.68]Like, you want me to stand up.
[117:24.82]I don't understand.
[117:26.22]I don't know what that means.
[117:28.51]It's a JoJo reference.
[117:31.97]Well, I'm sorry.
[117:32.89]I didn't know that everything that was pink and blue is a JoJo reference.
[117:37.25]I didn't know that.
[117:43.89]I just, I thought this was me.
[117:45.23]No, this is me.
[117:46.15]This is me and Jex.
[117:47.29]I know what this is.
[117:52.92]He doesn't get it.
[118:08.53]A stand as a summit, like a summoned person.
[118:14.54]That's the worst noise of 2008 and 19.
[118:15.98]No, it's not.
[118:17.52]Bullshit.
[118:18.94]Bugle Boy screaming into the urn is the worst noise ever on this channel.
[118:23.12]So that happened like three weeks ago.
[118:28.37]There's no contest.
[118:29.93]There will not be a contest for that because that will beat it every time.
[118:35.21]Bugle Boy is like jeans.
[118:39.01]Bugle Barry.
[118:41.83]Bugle Boy.
[118:44.88]Bugleboy's like clothes from the 90s Bugleberry screaming into the urn is the worst noise I've ever made while live on this channel Son of Bugleberry Bugleboy Streaming hot streaming cheesy cluck cluck is just cheesy chicken
[119:15.72]New character.
[119:16.42]Bugle.
[119:17.10]I think this clip is too quiet.
[119:18.90]Hold on.
[119:21.06]I'm going to warn you.
[119:21.86]I have not heard this in like three weeks.
[119:25.43]I'm going to play something very loud right now.
[119:30.19]So, I'm sorry, everybody.
[119:32.47]I need to hear what this sounds like.
[119:43.77]That's not it.
[119:47.64]This is so much reverb.
[119:51.36]I was fucking shitting myself laughing at this because the reverb is insane.
[119:59.25]It's insane.
[120:00.41]I didn't know it was this much reverb.
[120:06.83]Oh, I can feel it.
[120:14.58]Did you guys know that during this segment... Okay, listen.
[120:19.49]This is real.
[120:20.23]We're talking real talk right now.
[120:23.47]I don't know if we talked about this already, but we may have.
[120:26.65]During that... That stream had about 8,000 to 9,000 concurrent viewers watching, right?
[120:31.43]It was like 8,700 people watching before we got to Bugleberry.
[120:35.94]When Bugleberry came on screen, like almost 3,000 people left.
[120:43.77]It was like a catastrophe of viewers dropping.
[120:48.52]I was, it was so hard to fucking not like laugh at that.
[120:54.02]Oh my god.
[120:54.98]And everything that I saw was like, dude, it's so loud and I can't hear fucking anything.
[121:10.39]Oh.
[121:12.74]When I watch, like, clips of this back... There it is.
[121:14.82]There it is.
[121:15.18]There's the eep.
[121:17.20]This is gonna be really loud.
[121:19.72]Loud.
[121:20.14]A loud warning coming up.
[121:23.65]Very loud.
[121:24.31]I'm just... Seriously, this is not... I'm not kidding around.
[121:26.37]This is gonna be very loud.
[121:32.82]When I was told, hey, dude, like, we dropped, like, 3,000 viewers, I was just like, are you fucking serious?
[121:44.69]Oh my god, holy shit.
[121:57.88]Oh my fucking god, that's so bad.
[122:00.88]Holy shit, that's fucking loud.
[122:06.67]I can see it on the monitor.
[122:10.58]This more?
[122:11.14]3,000 people left.
[122:28.14]You know what's something funny about that stream?
[122:31.60]I'll give you another little tidbit of information.
[122:33.85]No joke.
[122:34.89]My actual reel, my mother watched that stream.
[122:39.35]And she said she watched it all.
[122:41.23]Right?
[122:43.01]So, I'm just sitting there going, holy shit.
[122:47.11]And she didn't say anything about, like, Bugleberry.
[122:50.75]The slime part was really funny.
[122:52.21]Wow, that was really interesting.
[122:53.53]Oh, thanks, Mom.
[122:55.85]The trivia was really funny.
[122:59.55]She didn't skip the middle 22 minutes of Bugleberry.
[123:04.05]She even turned it off.
[123:09.45]Mom saw you in a diaper.
[123:11.33]She's... My mother saw me in a diaper when I was two, okay?
[123:17.49]Who cares?
[123:17.92]This is great, by the way.
[123:23.88]They're like... Oh!
[123:54.06]Whatever.
[123:55.54]This is why we have to vet submissions.
[123:59.94]That was up for a very long time.
[124:02.51]It's okay.
[124:05.05]No, it didn't even say what you think it did.
[124:08.74]It said, whatever.
[124:09.54]Okay, this is StixRenegade saying, Stix, I'm going to draw your fursona.
[124:16.45]I said it like four years ago, and I just never did.
[124:19.71]I never did it, and spoiler alert, I never will.
[124:24.25]I think we need a reapplication.
[124:39.03]Because I will butcher it.
[124:40.59]You're not going to like it.
[124:42.03]You're not going to like it.
[124:42.97]I'm telling you.
[124:43.57]You think you want that.
[124:44.69]But then you're going to get it.
[124:45.35]And you're going to be like, this is so bad.
[124:49.37]And I'll turn it into merch.
[124:50.81]That's right.
[124:55.88]Chat will never let you forget this, Jeremy.
[124:57.50]And this is breaking news.
[124:59.14]The drawstrings of my pants just flopped directly into the urinal.
[125:02.00]What the fuck do I even do now?
[125:03.26]I've been walking around like I'm wearing a diaper.
[125:05.32]Because I don't want the drawstrings to touch me.
[125:11.41]I don't care.
[125:12.29]That's fine.
[125:13.05]That's a real problem that people can have.
[125:16.97]If you're wearing comfy pants and you go into a bathroom and you pull like your comfy pants down and your underwear down to pee into the urinal and then you have these, you know, long fucking strings that are like this long and they just went like into the fucking urinal.
[125:31.54]And like, what do I do now?
[125:32.98]What are you supposed to do?
[125:33.72]Just like, what do you do?
[125:37.44]You pull your pants down at a urinal.
[125:42.93]No.
[125:44.93]Did you hear what I said before that?
[125:47.86]If you're wearing comfy pants that don't have the hole that's in the middle of the pants, what do you do?
[125:54.76]Just pee through your pants?
[125:59.28]How are you supposed to go to the bathroom?
[126:02.77]If you have comfy pants on that do not have the hole in the middle?
[126:13.85]Why do people think I'm talking about dropping my pants to my ankles like butters from South Park?
[126:18.89]What?
[126:26.47]Just use a stall.
[126:28.61]Those guys shitting in there.
[126:35.38]Now, I'm not doing stall roulette.
[126:38.92]If you go to a very, very public bathroom with a bunch of people in it,
[126:42.41]people you never know which one's gonna have a person in it look if there's like six or seven stalls and there's like 40 people in 30 people in here I don't know who's in there no
[127:06.13]to lock.
[127:06.83]I don't know, but you don't want to walk up to a closed stall and be like, go, go, go, go, go.
[127:10.63]Oh, shit.
[127:11.45]Hey, oh, I'm in here.
[127:12.92]No, I'm sorry.
[127:13.32]I didn't mean to.
[127:15.18]I'll try the next one.
[127:24.72]Look, no.
[127:25.66]What?
[127:26.84]Is somebody in there?
[127:27.75]No, because look, I'm not talking about...
[127:35.79]They need to do, and this is an American bathroom problem because everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[127:43.13]When you go on an airplane, listen to me, this is so important.
[127:46.72]This is the most important thing I'm going to talk about all day.
[127:48.62]When you go to an airport and you go in an airplane and there's bathrooms there, right?
[127:55.30]When you go in and you close the door and you hit the little switch, a little fucking light is on.
[128:01.22]It just says that somebody's in it.
[128:04.90]No stalls in America have anything like that.
[128:09.45]Only some of them do.
[128:10.93]For the most part, American toilets are like three pieces of sheet metal that just sit hovering off the ground.
[128:20.05]And a lock that barely even goes forward enough to lock the door.
[128:25.95]So, if you want me to open a stall, if I don't know if somebody's in there, the door's not actually locked.
[128:30.58]It will open.
[128:34.18]It's just, it's enough to just not have the door do the stupid fucking thing that it does every time.
[128:39.40]When you go into a stall and you close the door behind you, it just opens again.
[128:44.07]And you're like, get the fuck away from me.
[128:45.37]And then you, that's enough to make it so the door doesn't hover back and hit you.
[128:50.93]Have stalls that go all the way down.
[128:54.01]They don't have holes, huge gaps in the corners.
[128:58.81]And make it so when you actually latch it, there's a little light.
[129:01.94]It just has to be a fucking like 30 cent red and green LEDs.
[129:06.70]And have it just be red or fucking green.
[129:09.68]Why is that so hard?
[129:13.58]It's easy.
[129:23.19]No joke, you're right about this.
[129:24.98]Yeah, we've been doing public bathrooms so incorrect in the United States for like 60 years.
[129:32.74]We're just all peeing into walls and like standing behind fucking bricks of sheet metal.
[129:40.04]If I designed a bathroom, I would probably win an award.
[129:44.08]I would win awards for this.
[129:47.47]It's not going to be expensive.
[129:48.63]It could be cheaper than it is now.
[129:53.91]No, I just talked about urinals.
[129:55.25]I never talked about stalls.
[129:57.32]Do what airplanes do.
[129:59.24]It makes everyone so much more secure.
[130:01.62]You don't have to fucking worry about, like, the gaps in the fucking stalls.
[130:05.92]Light, LED, red.
[130:07.54]I know that ones don't go in that one.
[130:09.68]That one is green.
[130:11.40]Now, if you went into a stall and you didn't put on the fucking light that's red and it's green, you gotta fucking be aware of that, okay?
[130:20.94]That's a you problem.
[130:23.66]You gotta... If it's green, it means it's vacant.
[130:31.18]Otherwise, you get into a problem there.
[130:33.29]That's the one issue.
[130:35.79]But it'll be locked anyways.
[130:36.81]No, it wouldn't, because you would do the thing to the airplane.
[130:39.11]You do the thing the airplanes do.
[130:40.05]When it's locked, it's red.
[130:40.97]Done.
[130:42.77]I'll take $100 million in a grant, please, to redo every bathroom in fucking America.
[130:50.98]This already exists?
[130:52.16]Yes, it does.
[130:53.18]It does already exist.
[130:54.52]On porta-potties.
[130:56.48]So porta-potties in the United States are better than bathrooms in fucking public places that may have cost $100,000 to $200,000 to make.
[131:06.21]A $89 plastic box is better.
[131:06.85]I had to defend myself on this.
[131:23.85]$200,000 bathroom?
[131:25.55]How much do you think toilets are?
[131:26.87]How much do you think those stalls cost?
[131:28.63]How much do you think every sink is?
[131:31.56]It's like a hundred fucking grand, 200 grand to make like a full like 20 toilet bathroom.
[131:40.84]Nice.
[131:43.41]Hey, somebody just gave, that was Modest Narcissist five community subs.
[131:46.73]Thank you, Modest Narcissist.
[131:47.71]Appreciate it.
[131:52.63]Thank you.
[131:55.54]Jerma has never been to a construction site porta-potty?
[132:02.93]No, guys.
[132:04.05]I don't, like, I don't, like, go pull over on the side of the road to, like, go use the bathroom at, like, the construction yard.
[132:12.29]I don't do that.
[132:15.60]Oh, I let me go to the bathroom.
[132:17.08]That seems like a good one.
[132:19.76]Jerma sucks.
[132:20.36]Thanks for five community subs.
[132:21.82]Tingy, five community subs.
[132:22.90]Thank you.
[132:26.86]like three or four back to back to back to back five subs thanks guys you're just too good for the common man's bathroom I'm trying to improve the common man's bathroom I'm trying to improve it and make it better for everybody what don't make me use my lightning hands

[133:04.86]Hey, there's Baby Boy!
[133:07.62]Baby Boy.
[133:09.80]Baby Boy.
[133:12.15]Beanbag Sonic.
[133:18.57]I'd do that face.
[133:22.59]I have a urinal installed in my house.
[133:24.21]Bathrooms are overrated.
[133:25.11]That actually would be kind of cool.
[133:27.73]I mean, sounds like you got a lot of money.
[133:28.95]This is great, though.
[133:35.55]Thank you, uh, Eternal, for this beautiful profile picture-esque beanbag Sonic.
[133:45.18]It's fantastic.
[133:56.15]How do I shit?
[133:58.70]In public bathroom?
[134:01.80]We're not going to get started on this.
[134:02.81]People are going to think I'm insane.
[134:05.09]This is Jerma lemur.
[134:10.43]There's like two or three of these in a row.
[134:24.71]Hey, there's a Jerma Naruto.
[134:31.67]I like the style.
[134:36.40]I still don't understand what they were thinking with this hat, though.
[134:38.76]With the hair.
[134:41.10]How would... Because you don't pull it down all the way.
[134:44.26]That's supposed to be a headband, right?
[134:45.68]This is really good pencil work?
[134:53.14]Pen work?
[134:55.08]Whatever it is, it's very thin.
[134:58.93]It just goes under the hair.
[135:00.21]Yeah, but if I pull that down... That was sitting on the top of my head, like, all the way up to the top.
[135:06.02]If I had pulled that down, the top part would have gone over my eyes.
[135:09.34]I was, like, balancing that, like, on the top of my forehead.
[135:14.46]Good.
[135:14.64]What do you mean, good?
[135:19.87]You have a small skull.
[135:23.23]I know.
[135:24.09]That's okay, though.
[135:27.11]But, no, this is great.
[135:27.73]Thank you for this.
[135:29.42]And we also have... This is from SlimeStream.
[135:34.67]That's me.
[135:35.75]I believe this is me.
[135:41.19]That was not me driving by.
[135:46.56]So there we are.
[135:51.98]Distraught.
[135:54.68]That's kind of a blurry photo, though.
[136:03.17]What?
[136:03.51]Wormy?
[136:04.35]What is wormy?
[136:08.97]What do you mean?
[136:09.59]Wait, what do you mean?
[136:10.85]What is that word?
[136:15.90]This is cool, though.
[136:22.76]I'm a boomer.
[136:23.74]I don't know what that is.
[136:26.58]It's a Splatoon thing.
[136:27.72]Oh, okay.
[136:30.36]Oh, alright.
[136:30.78]I get it.
[136:32.48]Have I ever played Splatoon?
[136:34.04]Maybe like for an hour.
[136:36.22]Oh, okay.
[136:37.40]So this is like a Splatoon character.
[136:38.72]Oh, alright.
[136:39.90]Now it makes sense.
[136:42.02]Now it makes sense.
[136:44.60]Splatoon.
[136:47.62]Very cool.

[137:10.38]More like Germany in 40 years.
[137:13.52]I'll still have this face.
[137:15.33]This face ain't going anywhere.
[137:18.45]I take way too much olive oil and way too much garlic and avocado oil for this face to turn anywhere.
[137:25.85]I'm sorry.
[137:31.49]Dr. Schmoyk's on the right.
[137:38.21]-2 for me.
[137:43.37]I had more points than that.

[138:16.41]Get rid of the don't sue me branding.
[138:20.81]Maybe a couple of little ice cubes.
[138:23.19]And what's that?
[138:24.71]Like steam coming out.
[138:27.17]Like up here.
[138:28.03]Because it's cooling them off, but it's fire.
[138:31.16]This is fucking amazing.
[138:35.88]Not out of his ass.
[138:36.92]Like up like... Like little smoke.

[138:59.34]It's Dunkin' Donuts is the name of the store that you get this coffee from.
[139:03.56]I'm not going to say it.
[139:06.82]He hates it.
[139:07.60]Why would I hate this when I just said it was by like
[139:12.24]I like this one.
[139:15.48]I can't play favorites because they're all, all these are my wonderful children.
[139:20.18]I can't play favorites on them.
[139:23.22]He's a liar.
[139:23.98]I hesitated because I didn't want to say favorite.
[139:30.34]It's great.

[139:51.31]Hate to break it to you.
[139:54.36]This is me as the giant rat, it seems.
[140:04.09]Equal parts terrifying and interesting.
[140:13.13]Did you say the blueberry flavor of Dunkin' Donuts is the worst, most disgusting flavor?
[140:21.17]Sometimes I think I'm an alien on Earth.
[140:24.51]When I read stuff like this.
[140:27.31]I feel like I'm from another planet.
[140:29.79]I have to be.
[140:34.23]Blueberry's the worst flavor from Dunkin' Donuts?

[143:03.38]I mean, I hate them.
[143:04.80]They're disgusting.
[143:05.88]I really don't like bugs at all.
[143:07.44]But, like, they get a bad rap.
[143:09.74]Because they're interesting.
[143:13.53]They're cool.

[145:49.36]But I'm really good at fucking making pies.
[145:52.26]Did you know that?
[146:02.09]Fucking wasps and hornets.
[146:04.23]They're mean.
[146:05.13]They're aggressive and they're angry all the time.

[146:48.99]I look like a LazyTown villain.
[146:59.83]It's the hair.
[147:04.75]It's like that plastic-y kind of hair in the outfit.
[147:11.58]Yes, it's online.
[147:12.26]Thanks for the five community subs.
[147:13.28]Yes.
[147:22.08]What would my gimmick be as a villain?
[147:26.53]I wouldn't have any gimmicks.
[147:30.47]I don't have gimmicks.
[147:39.04]Boring.
[147:40.48]Yeah, I'm just, it's just me.
[147:41.90]I just have like funny hair.
[147:45.86]I'm like every villain from all the Disney XD shows.
[147:51.00]Doesn't have any superpowers.
[147:53.10]Just dresses up in costumes and like is kind of fucking annoying.
[147:56.38]Right?
[148:03.35]Just gets in the way of stuff that the main characters are doing.
[148:09.79]happens to, like, pull the wrong lever?
[148:12.01]Like, if I'm messing up my plan?
[148:14.39]Yeah, I wouldn't be a very good villain.
[148:23.32]Let's go.
[148:25.38]Happy Thanksgiving.
[148:26.08]I hope you're hungry for some Jerma turkey.
[148:36.43]That's a lot of grapes and fruits.
[148:41.02]I don't eat very much fruit on Thanksgiving.
[148:43.96]Look, there's apples in here.
[148:48.06]Tons of grapes.
[148:49.90]Apples.
[148:51.42]Oranges?
[148:52.92]Oranges, oranges, grapes.
[148:56.65]I don't eat fruit on Thanksgiving.
[149:00.43]I mean, squash.
[149:01.01]Yeah, I mean, but that's... I eat squash, corn, green beans.
[149:05.59]I don't... Apples on Thanksgiving.
[149:07.15]Like, apple pie.
[149:08.67]Not like...
[149:11.65]Who eats, like, grapes, like, on fucking Thanksgiving?
[149:18.93]Do you guys do that?
[149:24.83]I've gotta be!
[149:28.61]From Pluto!
[149:33.65]Nice work, Dorkube.
[149:44.56]You got the facial hair really, really spot on.
[149:49.14]Because that's all that happens.
[149:54.69]When I grow out my facial hair, it just looks like somebody took a stapler and just went nuts with it.
[150:04.39]It's not good.
[150:10.08]But this, on the other hand, this is good.
[150:14.23]No emotion for two minutes.
[150:15.27]Why would I do that?
[150:17.06]We're going over some great community art right now, and then we're gonna go over community videos.
[150:21.84]Strap in for that one.
[150:24.90]We're almost done with this, I think.
[150:26.00]Only a few more.
[150:28.24]But, uh, good doodle.
[150:29.80]Good work.
[150:33.72]This is, uh, from the, I believe, the Space Ace stream, which is really cool.
[150:37.61]Or is this a JoJo reference?
[150:44.25]space ace it is now no it's not cowboy bebop I just saw I saw the blue and I saw the the like magenta it's from neither you guys got in my head here
[151:09.75]Everything is Jojo if it's like brightly colored blue and magenta and like pink.
[151:17.34]This is great, though.
[151:18.68]This is the light gun.
[151:21.32]By the way, for some of the new viewers that might be here that haven't been here for a while, in this shirt, mind you, in this shirt, I did it on first try.
[151:31.59]I played light gun games, which I'm very, very good at.
[151:34.39]First try, I did the bonus round in point blank, which is almost impossible to do.
[151:39.03]It is physically nearly impossible to complete it.
[151:41.94]And I did it first try.
[151:43.04]There's probably some new people here that don't know my light gun skills.
[151:53.38]Humble brag.
[151:53.96]No, that was a regular brag.
[151:56.96]That was like bragging it to your face.
[152:04.99]Awesome work though.
[152:05.85]And look at that!
[152:08.67]Good stuff.
[152:10.51]I like the glasses.
[152:13.79]I don't even have a pair of glasses like this.
[152:17.07]I should probably get some then.
[152:20.30]I'm a new viewer and I don't believe you.
[152:21.70]Somebody link the clip.
[152:22.72]It's ridiculous.
[152:26.00]And then I fell out the window.
[152:28.75]That hurt.
[152:32.37]I like the very, very nice glowing letters.
[152:35.73]It adds a lot.
[152:36.69]It does.
[152:39.13]No, not the haunted Bugleberry 3,000 people leave the stream noise.
[152:46.01]Now this is very interesting too.
[152:49.43]It's a nice suit.
[152:51.01]Is this... That's the J. That's really cool.
[152:57.80]I didn't even know this was the J at first.
[153:00.58]And that's me in a suit.
[153:04.31]Jerma985.
[153:08.23]That's a JoJo stance.
[153:09.51]But whatever.
[153:10.17]That's how I stand.
[153:13.71]I actually do kind of stand like that.
[153:20.90]I love that you made the J this interesting Power Rangers villain.
[153:28.33]That's awesome.
[153:33.99]He's my stand.
[153:43.42]You're such an old person.
[153:44.96]I haven't seen a television show.
[153:49.09]This is not like required reading in high school.
[153:54.22]I haven't seen this TV show.
[153:59.76]Yes, it is.
[154:00.66]Yes, it is.
[154:01.70]Well, alright.
[154:03.56]When your high school starts to have JoJo's Bizarre Adventure as required reading, then we'll talk.
[154:11.07]TV wasn't even invented yet.
[154:12.41]Eh, not yet.
[154:14.29]This is really well done, though.
[154:16.45]Is there like a heart monitor in the back?
[154:17.93]Like a, like a, the, what's the, the... One of those things.
[154:26.08]It's really cool.
[154:29.64]This is me fat.
[154:34.04]Like really fat.
[154:35.08]This is kind of how I feel right now.
[154:40.19]These are the clothes I wear every day.
[154:41.45]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[154:43.59]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[154:45.86]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[154:51.22]Stinky poopoo.
[154:52.00]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[154:56.04]Stinky poop... What are you guys fucking doing?
[155:03.02]It's a... Oh, it's called... It's the... Oh, right, okay.
[155:06.08]It's like a meme thing.
[155:08.34]I look over and I just see like a wave of people writing like poopoo, stinky poopoo and shit.
[155:13.69]I'm just like, what the fuck is going on over here?
[155:19.58]I'm like, why did this happen?
[155:23.88]No, I'm not watching meme video.
[155:25.62]Alright, this is fucking fat Jeremy.
[155:33.33]The Rumblers, the compact war.
[155:38.51]Holy shit, look at that.
[155:46.28]What is that?
[155:50.19]Is that bean bag?
[155:51.05]Is somebody like in a bean bag Sonic?
[155:53.07]Is that like a cosplay?
[156:05.44]This is awesome.
[156:08.32]Hey, there's Dr. Jerma.
[156:17.63]With the infinity gauntlet.
[156:21.98]There is Batboy, Pac-Man.
[156:25.61]They're all here.
[156:26.51]Everybody's here.
[156:29.29]Infinity War.
[156:32.98]Marvel's Smash Brothers.
[156:38.38]Poster.
[156:38.84]Let's get it.
[156:39.42]Poster.
[156:40.97]Everybody knows what I'm saying.
[156:41.81]Poster.
[156:48.44]There's a Glue Man.
[156:49.68]Like a pixelated version of Glue Man's face.
[156:51.74]Like we do have on the emote.
[156:57.24]It's actually really good.
[157:01.86]I really like this.
[157:04.10]Watch it.
[157:04.56]Watch it.
[157:04.96]I'm not going to watch the stinky poo-poo video.
[157:09.60]I'm not going to watch it.
[157:15.40]Please.
[157:16.12]Please.
[157:17.90]I'm not going to watch it.
[157:21.57]No.
[157:21.79]I'll watch it later like in bed.
[157:26.25]You're going to unsubscribe because I won't watch the uh-oh poopoo video.
[157:34.31]I don't know what to tell you on this one.
[157:38.15]I'll give you my review next stream.
[157:42.06]It's cursed.
[157:43.28]I'll give you my review next stream.
[157:45.54]This is great though.
[157:46.12]Reminds me of like a pixelated video game character.
[157:50.22]Unsubbing.
[157:52.84]I'm not gonna... I don't want to watch this video.
[157:54.94]We got so many other videos to watch.
[157:58.78]Do reactions.
[157:59.84]Reaction now.
[158:09.71]He's gonna lose 3000 viewers.
[158:12.29]No, I think I'll gain 3,000 viewers because I'm not going to watch that video.
[158:16.69]Because as many people that are writing this right now that want me to click that video, there's probably like 2,000 or 3,000 people that are here still right now that don't want me to watch it and will leave if I do.
[158:29.16]So what am I supposed to do here?
[158:32.22]3,000 people will leave if I don't click it and 3,000 people will leave if I do.
[158:36.02]What's the game plan here for me?
[158:43.86]Don't watch it.
[158:45.60]Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[158:48.16]Don't mind if I don't.
[158:51.43]Oh, RH, everybody, look what's on screen.
[158:55.55]The easiest way to make chat completely just focus on... Dog on screen.
[159:02.75]Dog on camera.
[159:04.11]Dog on camera.
[159:09.27]This is cute.
[159:11.33]He's so chunky.
[159:13.93]He's like, you know, he's like a little black bear.
[159:16.71]That's what he looks like.
[159:19.13]He's so cute.
[159:22.82]Yes, it's all love here with Otto.
[159:27.88]That's how I feel every morning.
[159:30.40]I just look at him and I'm like, you're the best.
[159:35.98]He's my best friend.
[159:41.55]Show Otto the video.
[159:44.28]I'm going to print out a picture of this video, like a thumbnail of the video.
[159:46.82]I'm going to eat it on camera.
[159:53.78]This is very, very good.
[159:55.95]I love this.
[159:57.27]You know who's going to love this?
[159:57.95]Kim would like this.
[159:58.71]Really, really.
[159:59.19]She loves drawings and pictures of Otto, just like I do.
[160:05.11]This you probably go, what is this photo of?
[160:07.13]Well, it's a photo of this.
[160:09.82]The coal miner.
[160:18.61]I still don't know why that even happened.
[160:20.07]That was so strange.
[160:28.91]I feel like it was worse than this at some point too.
[160:32.36]It's football Jerma.
[160:37.60]Look at that hair too.
[160:39.26]Look at that dusty hair.
[160:53.86]Somebody just wrote, do you guys have any idea how annoying this must be for Jeremy to see this over and over again?
[161:00.45]They won't, pestering him.
[161:10.59]I will watch the first, I will listen to the first one second of this video.
[161:20.67]If it is not... If it is not what I want... If I will click off of it if I do not want to watch this.
[161:26.89]Okay?
[161:34.92]Don't give in.
[161:36.26]You know what?
[161:36.58]Fuck it.
[161:36.86]I'm not giving in.
[161:38.18]It's true.
[161:44.62]Alright, what's next?
[161:46.32]Is there anything left?
[161:47.82]Hey, look at that!
[161:50.08]This is from the last stream.
[161:52.92]Bunch of psychos in this mall.
[161:55.84]For the love of God, Frank, put on some shoes.
[162:02.62]This is great.
[162:03.83]This was like a few days ago.
[162:09.79]Not all heroes wear capes.
[162:12.21]They just don't click poo-poo videos.
[162:14.93]If that's the criteria to be a hero, we've got a long way to go.
[162:22.20]Not all heroes wear shoes.
[162:26.98]Not all heroes wear shoes.
[162:31.82]This is great, thank you.
[162:33.38]Thank you, multi-trip.
[162:34.57]You did the watermark, too.
[162:35.75]Good.
[162:37.75]And, uh... Ladies and gentlemen... There's one more.
[162:43.71]There's one more.
[162:48.65]I... This is just fucking crazy.
[162:53.91]Watch this.
[163:07.75]This is what happens.
[163:10.36]You know what?
[163:10.96]It might seem like weird for you guys to see this, but this is the type of technology that actually existed back in like NBA 2K11.
[163:25.21]This is what it actually looked like when you did this.
[163:28.25]Like, NBA, like, 2K, like, 2009.
[163:30.55]It was this scary.
[163:36.21]But I don't even know how you... You must have just mapped my... That horrible face is that same image.
[163:41.19]I'm not gonna click on the ad.
[163:45.79]Under any circumstance.
[163:49.05]Jesus.
[163:53.05]But, that concludes the... I just clicked on the fucking ad accidentally, didn't I?
[163:59.19]No, I didn't.
[163:59.71]Thank God.
[164:01.47]That concludes the images portion of the stream today.
[164:07.04]We're gonna move on to the videos.
[164:09.38]And we got a bunch of these.
[164:10.48]We have a lot to go through.
[164:12.34]So, I told you there was a lot this time.
[164:15.26]I wasn't lying.
[164:16.66]There was a shitload of images and there's a shitload of videos, too.
[164:43.59]I'm done.
[164:44.35]I'm not watching anymore.
[164:45.94]No, I'm done.
[164:46.72]I'm not watching anymore of this.
[164:48.84]That was interesting.
[165:05.23]So first up, we've got... I need everyone to see this just because...
[165:40.12]This first one's called The Ring.
[165:41.92]It's called The Ring.
[165:42.88]I have to make myself a little smaller.
[165:46.54]Because I don't want to get in the way of any of these videos.
[165:50.04]Because that's what we're here for.
[165:51.84]We're here for the videos.
[165:52.50]And I also want to turn this way to be able to watch them with you.
[165:55.86]Let's go this way.
[165:57.64]Sit here.
[166:00.73]Make sure I'm in a good spot to view.
[166:02.65]I need a good viewing angle.
[166:07.45]Okay.
[166:07.57]Okay.
[166:10.23]Here we go.
[166:18.53]What's on the tape?
[166:20.43]There's a videotape.
[166:22.83]Did you see it?
[166:26.77]It looks like she's watching.
[166:28.43]What is that?
[166:29.07]I don't know.
[166:40.68]I went to a field trip today, and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer.
[166:46.56]That's the whole video.
[166:48.94]That's the whole video.
[167:02.65]It's not even... Again?
[167:04.77]You want to see it again?
[167:05.59]Fine.
[167:06.95]We encore some of them.
[167:11.52]I went to a field trip today and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer
[167:42.24]Why?
[167:43.08]But why the ring?
[167:45.46]But why the ring?
[167:50.36]That was the ring.
[167:53.50]Coming up next.
[167:55.00]You're going to get flashed every time.
[167:56.38]I'm sorry.
[167:56.90]I'm going to take a photo of you.
[167:58.32]This is called Compact Python and the Holy Sippy.
[168:51.30]And it's- you gotta do a- you're gonna- you're gonna whoo on me here?
[168:55.46]Hold on.
[168:57.46]Look at the anger in the face.
[169:02.57]Look at that.
[169:03.27]I look fucking so mean and fucked up.
[169:08.79]That was a JoJo reference.
[169:11.59]No, it's not.
[169:12.05]That's- This is not- that's- Eric Andre?
[169:22.94]How is that a JoJo reference?
[169:27.94]That's because of the arrow.
[169:30.70]Oh, well, that was very good.
[169:34.37]Classic scene from a classic movie, if you haven't seen it.
[169:40.39]This is Jerma slaps himself a lot.
[169:43.15]So you can imagine what this one might look like.
[169:47.80]Oh, you want to fight?
[169:48.60]You want to fight?
[169:49.34]Don't fucking at me!
[170:07.62]It actually sounds pretty good.
[170:14.86]Holy fuck, it's loud, though.
[170:31.78]Oh, you want to fight?
[170:32.60]Don't fuck with that.
[170:45.39]last clip from it's from the carnival Jerma streams watching videos just like I'm doing right now that was pretty crazy that's you know what that takes a lot of time because here's something maybe somebody better editing aficionados don't know every single one of these slaps
[171:12.19]had to be placed on a timeline at the right second.
[171:15.74]You wanna fight?
[171:16.48]You wanna fucking fight?
[171:17.20]Don't fucking come at me.
[171:18.50]Don't.
[171:21.66]That's like four hours of work right there.
[171:24.52]Right there.
[171:32.05]This literally takes hours to do this.
[171:36.99]There's a musical timeline?
[171:38.29]You still gotta place it though.
[171:41.48]What is FL Studio, by the way?
[171:42.94]I don't know.
[171:51.50]Local streamer is a door-to-door salesman starring Homer Simpson on a big beanbag chair.

[177:59.22]You don't reveal the face!
[178:04.69]Now everybody knows who's under there.
[178:08.57]I gotta tell you, this costume is better than the costume that was in the actual wrestling event.
[178:18.08]Like, holy shit.
[178:19.50]That's one-to-one correct.
[178:23.18]Excellent job.
[178:24.98]Is this canon?
[178:27.33]This is a dream of somebody.
[178:28.97]This is somebody who had a dream of the wrestling event.
[178:32.39]And then it was down here.
[178:33.61]Is it canon?
[178:38.72]It's canon and a dream.
[178:40.30]Right?
[178:42.54]It's a dream canon.
[178:45.36]That was called Dick Richard vs. Fat Jerma, a test of strength.

[179:52.31]It's just right here.
[179:53.19]It's just like 10 seconds.

[180:02.15]I love it.
[180:14.62]Uh, Jerma fights Crash PlayStation for the fate of nothing in particular in cinematic widescreen.
[180:19.96]Well, actually, this is like... This is actually probably... 9?

[188:02.29]Something like Bigfoot.
[188:04.09]Trapper, there's something walking right up here.
[188:06.95]It's not real far away.

[189:03.19]Talk to me, Hau.
[189:04.57]He's right there.
[189:05.65]He went over the hill.

[189:16.08]Howl at me, you son of a bitch, Hau.
[189:18.78]Don't howl.
[189:23.20]He's pissed.
[189:24.66]Yes, he's pissed.
[189:25.90]We just heard something howl here in the woods, and it was huge.
[189:28.20]It was intimidating.
[189:29.23]It was huge.
[189:29.75]It was super, super loud.
[189:36.58]I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.
[189:40.08]Holy crap.
[189:41.52]Nothing to do with this.
[189:43.12]Nothing to do with this.
[189:44.52]It's right there.
[189:45.18]Right there.
[189:45.70]I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.
[189:47.11]Let's get this out of here.
[189:48.23]Right now.
[189:48.79]Come on.
[189:49.05]Close in on him.
[189:49.83]Really?
[189:50.73]Really?
[189:51.45]Right now to go, Jeff.
[189:53.35]I'm looking right in there.
[189:54.55]I can't see.
[189:55.77]Oh, no.
[189:58.41]This TV show, they just go in the woods and pretend to be chasing Bigfoot?
[190:28.32]I'm more interested in this television show.
[190:35.16]Yes, he's pissed.
[190:36.94]We just heard something howl here in the woods.
[190:41.14]Not just Bigfoot.
[190:43.58]How many other monsters are there out in the woods?
[190:48.45]There's animals in the woods.
[190:49.91]There are bears.
[190:50.61]There are deer.
[190:52.39]There's like wolves.
[190:55.37]Bugs and shit.
[190:56.09]Like frogs.
[190:58.96]What monsters are in the woods?
[191:03.96]The Mothman.
[191:09.56]It's the devil.
[191:12.91]It's a Yeti.
[191:13.65]It's the Abominable Snowman.
[191:17.13]They have like 11 seasons of getting just misinterpretations of bears making noise.
[191:29.58]Really All effectively that I had this happening right here is just a bunch of guys are stumbling through the woods like irritating and scaring animals Where you got Jeff you got anything like flash walking right up here, it's not real far away It's not they got like guns
[191:57.98]Haven't you seen a movie?
[191:59.34]Don't you know that, like, you're going after, like, Bigfoot with, what is this, a fucking, like, a shotgun?
[192:04.83]It's not gonna work.
[192:07.27]The guns aren't even real.
[192:11.61]Bigfoot is, you're not gonna kill him with a shotgun.
[192:15.35]You might be able to kill Bigfoot with, like, a large rock that you hold over, like, it has to be as big as, like, it's like a boulder.
[192:22.24]And you drop it on him.
[192:24.06]You're gonna shoot him with, like, a pellet gun?
[192:28.71]These guys, they can't even see anything.
[192:30.19]What are you gonna shoot at?
[192:33.43]You're gonna miss.
[192:37.41]And they have these minor helmets on that can only see maybe like three or four feet in front of them.
[192:45.03]If Bigfoot is running at you from 200 feet away, you need floodlights and traps and they're not helmets.
[192:55.08]They're just bands.
[193:00.31]I want to watch this show.
[193:01.65]What is this show actually called?
[193:05.78]Rustling Leaves in the Woods?
[193:10.06]It's called Mountain Monsters.
[193:18.63]Mountain Monsters.
[193:23.91]Have they ever found a guy camping?
[193:27.19]I heard that noise over there there's somebody over there yeah and there's a guy just like a Campbell suit and he's just like hello you guys alright that's called live footage from the Vegas region Pokémon speed
[193:57.78]I don't know, I don't know, I don't understand this breakfast.
[193:59.96]No!
[194:01.93]No, you do it!
[194:04.95]You do it.
[194:08.37]I'm sleeping.
[194:15.30]Yeah?
[194:16.50]Why am I here?
[194:19.08]Okay, Mom.
[194:39.41]Five more minutes, Mom!
[194:44.57]Mom!
[194:46.29]Jesus.
[194:49.60]So what?
[194:50.20]Wait, Pokémon did a 24-hour stream where it showed Pokémon sleeping?
[194:59.50]Why did they do that?
[195:04.93]It was live from a region in the game.
[195:08.39]It was worse than that.
[195:11.79]So wait, it just showed like a picture on screen?
[195:14.17]It showed nothing and rustling bushes and a horse.
[195:19.74]So you're telling me that Mountain Monsters has more content in it than the Pokémon live stream?
[195:29.58]Interesting stuff.
[195:31.91]This is called Lego Intruder Jerma in the Bathroom Tiles.

[253:48.99]You can just pretend you did a bunch of cool shit.
[253:52.32]Just have a computer costume on.
[254:00.07]That's a Snapchat filter.
[254:10.75]Still, you don't have to do anything anymore.
[254:15.77]You just have to put like a Snapchat filter on and then like put a fake beach behind you.
[254:24.34]It's the same thing.

[254:32.21]Uh, you want a link to this one?

[268:26.81]Wait, what do you do with this?
[268:33.32]I guess you don't, I don't know what you use this for.
[268:37.88]Don't worry, you're gonna get an extra fucking, like, eight hours of, probably not that much.
[268:42.38]You're gonna get, like, an extra, like, six, five to four to six hours of new actions in front of the screen.
[268:50.80]Use it as a segue, that's true.
[268:55.89]I don't know about this one, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna play this and then I might have to stop playing this one.
[269:03.57]Because I see the title, and this might be a very quick turn off.
[269:07.71]Okay, so already I know it's not going to work.
[269:10.33]I'm going to teach you how to pull it off, Star.
[269:13.53]Are you ready for this?
[269:15.37]Okay, we're not going to play this one.
[269:16.51]That was the last one.
[269:50.47]That was so fucked up.
[269:52.83]That was so fucked up.
[269:54.35]I'm not playing that.
[269:55.86]No, I'm not playing that.
[269:57.18]We'll play this one.

[271:24.16]Somebody made it.
[271:24.88]And this is exactly what it was going to be.
[271:27.32]This is the actual, like, what the third Rats movie song was going to sound like.
[271:31.84]Here you go.
[271:51.01]There he is!
[271:51.59]And then the horn comes in!
[271:53.25]And then the fucking horn comes in!
[271:59.07]This is a dungeon theme?
[272:20.49]You aren't listening?
[272:21.83]I took out- Yeah, what?
[272:22.67]It's because it was really loud for me.
[272:26.96]You aren't even- I didn't mean to not listen.
[272:28.54]I could hear it because it was so loud because I had my- Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[272:33.20]No, no.
[272:36.82]It was very loud for me, so even with it out, I could hear it very clearly.
[272:42.31]Okay.
[272:44.07]And then the horn comes in.
[272:50.95]He hates it.

[273:42.56]I had my first kiss here.
[273:44.78]Oh, Jesus, man.
[273:49.16]Big face, yeah.
[273:50.48]Oh, he's grinning again.
[273:51.28]This one's pretty good.
[274:14.13]No emotion?
[274:14.85]Why would I do no emotion to a hot single like this?
[274:18.81]Car commercial?
[274:20.73]What, me or this?
[274:21.77]React more.
[274:22.59]Alright, fine.
[274:23.05]No, I'm not gonna react more!
[274:24.69]Why?
[274:42.34]What do you want me to turn it like a fucking cartoon?
[274:45.22]Is this what you were looking for?
[274:47.58]Wow!
[274:49.14]What an interesting song this is.
[274:56.78]I especially like this part.
[274:57.98]Are we in sync?
[275:11.04]That's what Mark Zuckerberg does.
[275:12.62]No, what?
[275:13.24]Is that what he does?
[275:15.18]He just goes like... Let's go!
[275:39.28]I could just, like, bop my head with this.
[275:40.68]This is a head bopper.
[275:42.14]Dance to the music.
[275:45.02]Let's go.
[275:45.64]Roll her shoulder.
[276:09.23]What the fuck is Jerma dancing?
[276:10.51]Why am I dancing?
[276:11.25]Because I'm listening to a community-made song.
[276:13.09]I'm in my living room right now.
[276:15.49]I painted my living room wall green.
[276:18.04]I hope it looks alright.
[276:20.26]Did it?
[276:20.50]I hope it did.
[276:21.06]What's the name of the song?
[276:23.42]It's called Jerma 51.
[276:25.94]You want to link to this one?
[276:41.68]And that, wait, we got one more.
[276:46.22]This one is called, this one's called Wait on Red.
[276:51.56]It's inspired from the ending screen.
[277:01.37]Don't forget this one.
[277:02.39]Wait, wait, what are you linking?
[277:05.49]Let me don't forget this one.
[277:09.84]Jerma, Jackson, Jerma duet singing September on stream.
[277:18.23]What are you talking about?
[277:24.87]Did that come in today?
[277:26.46]Because this is all as of like last night.
[277:30.42]Was it, did it come in today?
[277:31.86]Was that like this afternoon?
[277:35.08]That's going to have to be on the next one.
[277:37.85]It was from 11 hours ago.
[277:39.17]The cutoff was yesterday.
[277:42.06]Who cares?
[277:42.62]I'm trying to listen to a song.
[277:51.04]Fine.
[277:51.58]Link it to me again.
[277:54.83]Follow the rules.
[277:58.21]You're the streamer.
[277:59.13]Make the rules.
[278:01.01]No, no, no.
[278:01.55]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[278:02.91]Save it for next time.
[278:10.83]What?
[278:11.01]Somebody called me a skull?
[278:12.01]Wait, why are you calling me a skull?
[278:17.69]Fuck your rules.
[278:21.29]Do you want me to just fucking sneeze over there?
[278:24.55]And just sneeze into you and have it just... You just fall backwards.
[278:28.20]With the might of the air that comes out of my body.
[278:35.38]No, we need content.
[278:37.28]This happens every like 30 or 40 days.
[278:40.74]It's a perfect amount of time.
[278:43.72]Four to five hours.
[278:44.94]That's perfect for like a full community stream.
[278:48.70]Yeah, we want to have to... I want this to be like three plus, four plus hours every time.
[278:59.35]I'll sneeze in your face.
[279:00.83]Well, don't do that.
[279:03.97]Give us the post or give us uh-oh stinky.
[279:07.25]You're not going to get...
[279:10.52]Any of those things.
[279:13.65]Give me the rats link.
[279:14.73]Well, let me link all these.
[279:17.21]This is the rats one.
[279:22.45]And then this is the one we just listened to.
[279:29.01]I'm not going to play that video.
[279:33.54]Why would I play that?
[279:36.12]It's like me gnoming myself.
[279:39.70]What's going on?
[279:40.12]Why does my camera do this?
[279:47.21]Now, that's it for today.
[279:50.29]See?
[279:50.89]Why does it do that shit?
[279:57.01]So, what's going to happen here over the next couple days is tomorrow, I have no idea what I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[280:09.77]Because there's like two or three things that I really want to do.
[280:13.07]But I'm not sure... If... I don't know which one I want to do.
[280:22.98]Because like Outer Worlds is something that I thought I would want to do.
[280:26.46]Dead Rising 2 is something I want to do.
[280:30.42]Katamari is another one that would be fun to do.
[280:32.57]Like the second Katamari game.
[280:35.90]I'm gonna have to, like, throw dice in the air.
[280:39.24]I really don't know.
[280:45.20]I'm gonna actually throw dice up in the air.
[280:47.66]And whatever they land on, I'll have numbers for each one.
[280:52.34]We'll see.
[280:52.66]It'll be something fun.
[280:54.96]And then, as of this coming weekend here, there's gonna be another... I'm gonna address you directly, because I feel like it's more interpersonal that way.
[281:03.99]In like three days, there's going to be another channel in that Discord, and it's going to be the green screen movie night DLC for free.
[281:11.99]You're going to go, there's going to be two channels, one to discuss, and one to make suggestions.
[281:19.68]And then the green screen stream will happen probably two weeks from now.
[281:23.56]Two to three weeks, depending on how many submissions we get.
[281:28.06]Dead Rising 2 has gambling?
[281:30.07]Well, you just convinced me.
[281:34.96]Eyes up here.
[281:39.53]Stop.
[281:44.11]Why the fuck do I read these things?
[281:51.24]Anyways.
[281:52.96]The whole game takes place in Vegas.
[281:54.52]Does it actually?
[281:55.18]Is it for real?
[281:55.72]That's pretty cool, actually.
[281:56.76]Alright.
[282:01.24]Thank you again.
[282:03.08]I love doing this shit.
[282:05.20]I think there's a ton of people that need to be showcased in this community.
[282:08.76]I think you guys make some of the funniest shit that I've seen.
[282:12.29]There were at least again, like last time, at least five to 10 of these videos and images that made me hurt laughing.
[282:19.67]So I cannot wait to give you guys all more material because
[282:27.45]the more material that you have, the more shit that you could just come up with.
[282:32.06]And I love every second of it.
[282:35.44]So, thank you so much for all of your contributions.
[282:39.64]There's a lot of them.
[282:41.22]People continue to put stuff.
[282:42.32]If you don't know, go to the Discord.
[282:44.50]Community Content Nights.
[282:46.34]Put something there.
[282:47.98]Art, video, music related.
[282:50.34]Something related to the community or the channel.
[282:53.94]And I can't wait to see it.
[282:59.04]Great fucking job.
[283:05.14]I will see you guys tomorrow for either Dead Rising 2 or Outer Worlds or Katamari or I don't know.
[283:24.09]No, I'm probably not going to play on stream Death Stranding.
[283:29.05]Looks really interesting.
[283:30.39]Dead Rising 2 off the record?
[283:32.29]Well, you put an emote on it, so... It really is going to come down to what I want to do tomorrow.
[283:41.58]I'm going to get up in the morning and go, you know what, that's what I want.
[283:44.12]I'm going to do Dead Rising 2.
[283:46.14]Or, no, I want to play an RPG.
[283:47.74]It's how I get up in the morning tomorrow.
[283:53.04]that Stranding is an awful stream game.
[283:56.70]I mean, it looks like people are having fun with it.
[283:58.54]I know a ton of people are streaming it right now.
[284:05.53]I don't think I want to play it on stream, though.
[284:18.52]More like walking?
[284:22.57]It's all good.
[284:24.19]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[284:25.13]We'll figure it out.
[284:26.07]I'll be in the pre-stream.
[284:27.97]You guys will see me in the pre-stream.
[284:30.51]At least an hour or so before the stream starts in the first place and we'll figure it out.
[284:33.58]We'll go over what we can do.
[284:37.56]Thanks for watching, guys.
[284:43.76]So before community content night number three happens, there will be a second green screen.
[284:51.04]So keep that in mind.
[284:52.22]The one that will happen in next month, I might push it back a few extra weeks, like a week or two, just to make sure if people want to get some of the second green screen stuff in, they can.
[285:12.38]Is Community Night monthly?
[285:14.36]Um, monthly with an asterisk.
[285:19.69]Because it's probably going to end up to be every month and a half.
[285:26.66]Because the last one was in September.
[285:28.48]September like 20th.
[285:29.68]Or like September 18th or something.
[285:32.80]And now we're at November 10th.
[285:36.23]So it's probably going to be like bi-monthly.
[285:40.89]Because there does have to be enough to do a stream on it.
[285:45.31]So that channel will load up.
[285:49.87]Every month or two, when there's enough to do like a three, four hour stream, then hell yeah.
[286:00.38]Thanks a lot, though.
[286:05.54]It's still the same.
[286:07.58]It'll always be.
[286:08.24]It's always going to be you.
[286:14.70]Did he watch?
[286:15.16]Uh-oh, Stinky.
[286:16.04]Yeah, I did.
[286:17.11]I watched it twice.
[286:18.53]Once in slow motion to make sure I could get the whole thing.
[286:24.05]But let's do the bits.
[286:25.95]See you tomorrow.
[286:26.84]Take care of yourselves.
[286:28.98]If you're sticking around, we've got a little bit of extra talking to do here.
[286:36.86]So we had...
[286:39.36]Uh, Snowflakes, am I right for $250?
[286:41.34]They said, my PC blue-screened earlier this week.
[286:44.48]Got it working this week at about $600 worth of parts later.
[286:49.65]That's not good.
[286:51.41]I didn't get around to posting on the Discord.
[286:53.13]Did a few more portraits.
[286:55.45]Plus Watermark, the older one.
[286:59.67]Ooh, stick those in there.
[287:01.73]Stick those in there.
[287:04.23]Stick those in there.
[287:05.49]Stick those in there.
[287:12.61]No, everybody just everybody just left their portraits We saw two of these already I watermarked the older ones there is a Glue Man and auto portrait of
[287:41.74]Catching up on all VODs, did Kim enjoy the portrait?
[287:44.78]I'll upload them to my Insta, same as the watermark.
[287:46.88]Hope that's chill.
[287:54.08]Yeah, they're fucking incredible.
[287:59.11]This is fucking unbelievable.
[288:00.85]Like, alright.
[288:02.97]This was technically... Technically, it was supposed to be there yesterday.
[288:07.89]This was supposed to be there yesterday.
[288:09.63]Because their computer fucked up.
[288:11.31]Okay?
[288:14.31]Right?
[288:16.73]This is not breaking any rules.
[288:18.47]This was supposed to be submitted yesterday.
[288:23.03]But look at this.
[288:26.34]I promise you guys this is not just like a close-up of like inside of my nose.
[288:37.09]Let me get this on the viewing angle here.
[288:47.41]I thought this was a photo.
[288:51.15]That's how ridiculous this is.
[288:52.24]Are you kidding me?
[289:08.42]Look at that.
[289:09.92]It's unbelievable.
[289:12.95]It's unbelievable.
[289:15.96]This is a camera.
[289:17.32]This is a photo.
[289:24.81]I had... I gotta break the rule.
[289:32.95]You know... Okay.
[289:34.69]My, like, mother would love this.
[289:41.00]Look at this, like, detail.
[289:42.62]It's...
[289:45.19]I can't even describe how good this is.
[289:50.97]Nice work, seriously.
[289:55.40]That's like a 10 out of 10.
[290:01.50]They drew, yeah, they drew this, they drew this.
[290:06.26]And there's another one.
[290:08.00]The other one is of, uh, Glue Man.
[290:14.17]And wait a minute.
[290:15.15]Oh, please.
[290:16.39]Wait, please.
[290:17.77]Oh my god.
[290:19.03]I'm gonna like actually have... I'm gonna print this.
[290:22.35]It's my favorite character.
[290:26.80]Yes!
[290:28.86]It's Bugleberry.
[290:29.92]There's a... You did a Bugleberry.
[290:35.69]Fantastic.
[290:36.41]Hold on.
[290:50.34]That is wild.
[290:57.74]And there's that one and then there's a Glue Man as well.
[291:05.69]Best character.
[291:06.35]Best worst character ever.
[291:08.85]Speaking of best worst characters ever.
[291:10.31]There's another one.
[291:24.67]Good shit.
[291:32.81]Let's get in close.
[291:42.39]This is the kind of shit that I would print out all three of these and put them in small frames and have it decorate my entryway.
[291:56.71]incredible do it then maybe I will uh thank you so much sorry you couldn't get it in by today but that sucks here about your computer that was snowflakes am I right or sneeuw vluckies with those insane incredible pieces of art thank you for those
[292:27.78]We had 250 bits from Espada.
[292:32.12]They say, checks taste like shit.
[292:33.90]I agree.
[292:38.72]Checks do... I don't like them.
[292:40.32]I think they're very bad.
[292:42.25]I agree with... Don't break everything.
[292:46.61]Every time you hear noise like that, that's me raising my arms to talk with my hands and smashing into something on my desk.
[292:55.79]That's why that happens.
[293:00.72]Like, be putting my hands up.
[293:01.48]Be, like, moving my hands around.
[293:08.76]Thank you, Topac, for the 250.
[293:10.02]Shido was alive and well with the whole gang.
[293:11.56]They released a new music video, and they're coming for you next.
[293:19.37]It's a sweet victory automaton.
[293:29.63]Thank you, Topac.
[293:36.17]Hey, thank you Stevie the ex-Evie for the 400 bits.
[293:38.73]They say they had a dream about you two nights ago where you were hosting some strange Who Wants to Be a Millionaire event IRL with fans and viewers you invited.
[293:49.05]Viewers who lost you started openly taunting and mocking each time.
[293:55.77]My friend got up and nominated me after their turn, in which you gave me a hug and the event turned into some jackbox game where the answer is picked by majority vote by fans.
[294:04.70]Of course, the first answer was feet.
[294:07.24]Feetsies, in which you overreacted.
[294:23.37]At least I wasn't trying to, like, chase you and kill you.
[294:26.51]Like, some people have weird dreams like that.
[294:32.65]But thank you, Stevie.
[294:33.97]You know what we're gonna have to do?
[294:35.39]Pause the music for a sec.
[294:36.08]We're going to have to do a night where the point of the stream
[294:54.38]is to add emotes you gotta catch me on camera on stream and we do it on stream this is I don't this will probably take a couple hours I will even title the stream like I'm just putting up new emotes don't watch
[295:20.87]There'd be no reason to watch.
[295:22.87]But you got me, and you got me on camera, and let's put in like 10 new emotes.
[295:33.41]We'll probably do that at some point soon.
[295:46.20]Not tomorrow.
[295:46.80]No, tomorrow.
[295:47.22]I'm going to play a game tomorrow.
[295:52.20]Hey, Stinky, thanks for the 250.
[295:53.74]They say, eat boogers.
[295:55.80]Sometimes you do accidentally.
[295:56.82]Everybody does.
[295:57.92]It's okay.
[296:01.96]Thank you, Alamanda, for the 1500 bits.
[296:06.29]They say, hey, Jerma, I know I really love your streams because none of my friends know who you are.
[296:11.21]And yet I still... I love it still.
[296:14.07]Here's a joke as payment.
[296:17.63]My girlfriend has a...
[296:30.62]Not allergy.
[296:39.57]Something, something, something.
[296:44.39]This is like another part of the joke.
[296:46.27]I just didn't write it.
[296:49.36]I didn't read it.
[296:50.76]That's not bad, but I don't even know why I stopped.
[297:00.61]So you admit that you're... I'm not the Joker.
[297:05.86]I don't even... I can't... I'm trying to piece this, like, riddle joke together.
[297:09.26]I can't... I... Thank you for the incredible 1500 bits.
[297:18.77]But it doesn't matter if your friends don't know who I am.
[297:27.34]It's all good.
[297:29.18]Maybe they'll find it eventually.
[297:31.61]Just link them to the screaming, crying, farting face slap video.
[297:35.71]I'm sure they'll be a fan immediately.
[297:40.89]No, thanks for the $15, though.
[297:41.99]Seriously.
[297:42.35]Thank you, Doc3660 for the 300 bits.
[297:47.07]Jeremiah, I could really use some advice.
[297:48.39]I'm 22 right now, and I'm really skinny.
[297:50.75]I want to gain muscle.
[297:54.34]get bigger but not sure where to start do I eat like crazy for a month get fat and then hit the gym do I just hit the gym right away and eat more at the same time where do I start thanks a lot um depending on how honestly you just have to eat well you have to eat a lot of protein you have taken a lot of protein and taken a lot of good fats
[298:22.93]Don't just eat McDonald's and Papa Gino's and Burger King and shit and you'll get, yeah, you'll gain weight.
[298:30.33]All of it in your ass and in your stomach.
[298:32.87]And maybe a little bit on your face.
[298:34.19]The rest of you won't get anything.
[298:40.94]You need to eat quality protein.
[298:44.38]Quality food.
[298:46.00]High calorie foods.
[298:48.64]That aren't junk.
[298:54.03]Eat good fats.
[298:55.88]That's like peanut butter.
[298:57.88]That's like different oils, like olive oil.
[299:05.98]Cans of tuna straight out of the can.
[299:07.78]That's what I did.
[299:08.70]But I'm crazy.
[299:10.62]Don't like do the shit that I did.
[299:16.33]I can't give you advice that a doctor would give you that's actually good advice.
[299:21.69]Because if I told my doctor that I was eating two or three cans of tuna a day, they'd probably be like, what are you doing?
[299:28.45]Don't do that.
[299:29.11]That's terrible.
[299:30.19]And I'd be like, I had to get big.
[299:37.84]The reason why I ate a lot of tuna fish is because it's cheap.
[299:42.72]Because if you need to eat a lot of food...
[299:46.09]you know, it can get expensive, especially if you eat, you know, if you're trying to take in more than two, three, like 2,500 calories a day that you're trying to work off and like build muscle, it can get expensive.
[300:05.40]Don't get Mercury poisoning from eating straight tuna for three weeks.
[300:08.03]That's what I'm telling you.
[300:08.75]Don't listen to me.
[300:18.21]Just eat good food and eat.
[300:21.43]Don't just eat one or two times a day like everybody does.
[300:25.53]You should be eating.
[300:27.69]You should be constantly giving your body energy.
[300:31.37]So that's not two huge meals a day.
[300:35.01]That's four, five, six small meals over the course of the day.
[300:47.30]It's actually much better for you to eat smaller meals than huge ones.
[300:54.50]Constant energy.
[300:55.86]Drink lots of water.
[300:59.44]Guys, you shouldn't be listening to me ever because I... Okay, I'm gonna say something here and then people are gonna be like, you're fucking insane.
[301:06.00]Alright, I know.
[301:07.98]But listen to me.
[301:09.20]Are you listening?
[301:09.80]Listen to me.
[301:10.17]You know what I mean?
[301:11.43]Listen to me.
[301:11.89]Listen to me about this.
[301:12.39]You know what I'm saying?
[301:14.01]I used to just eat out of the jar...
[301:18.50]tahini paste because it's the most calorie-dense food on Earth.
[301:29.87]One tablespoon of tahini paste is 89 calories.
[301:39.97]Like Winnie the Pooh.
[301:54.54]But tahini, it's so calorie dense.
[301:58.79]It's sesame seeds.
[302:00.47]Tahini is ground up sesame seeds.
[302:03.81]Toasted ground hulled sesame.
[302:07.45]It's the most calorie dense food in the world.
[302:14.86]It's like peanut butter.
[302:16.60]If peanut butter took out all like the... It's good for you.
[302:21.44]Tahini is good for you.
[302:22.44]Just not a jar of it.
[302:25.15]It's got a polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats.
[302:28.41]It's got no cholesterol.
[302:33.06]It's just don't eat a jar of it.
[302:34.20]But don't listen to me.
[302:35.84]I'm wrong.
[302:36.52]And I know I am.
[302:39.10]But I was putting tahini paste in place of stuff like mayonnaise.
[302:44.37]Like if I made a sandwich, like, you know, sandwich with a lettuce, tomato, a little bit of onion, some like deli turkey, a slice of cheese.
[302:51.95]Tahini paste.
[302:54.10]Because it was going to add like 200 calories to the meal.
[302:56.34]What do you mean this keeps getting worse?
[303:01.28]Eating a turkey sandwich is bad?
[303:02.71]What are you talking about?
[303:14.53]How have I not gotten diabetes from these foods?
[303:18.05]There's like no sugar in tahini.
[303:21.69]There's nothing.
[303:22.51]Tahini's good.
[303:23.21]Tahini's not bad for you.
[303:27.34]Say tahini three more times.
[303:29.10]Tahini.
[303:29.54]Tahini.
[303:31.48]Hummus.
[303:31.76]There's another one.
[303:32.24]Yeah.
[303:42.37]Eggs.
[303:42.85]Yep.
[303:44.79]Guys, everything is bad.
[303:47.19]Everything is bad for you.
[303:50.08]If you eat a shitload of eggs, your cholesterol is gonna go skyrocket.
[303:54.28]You eat a shitload of fucking fish, you're gonna get Mercury poisoning.
[303:58.81]You eat a bunch of steak, you're gonna get fat.
[304:02.65]Everything sucks!
[304:07.85]Just mix them all together and eat it like five times a day.
[304:12.11]Slowly.
[304:16.75]Just dump a beer in there too.
[304:18.59]And blend.
[304:27.81]No, honestly, without fucking around and no jokes and everything, the best advice I can give you is... Eat high-quality food more often.
[304:37.03]Don't just get fat to burn it off, because burning fat is actually way harder than building muscle.
[304:43.89]Sometimes you just won't get rid of it.
[304:46.01]It'll just be there for life.
[304:53.06]Just don't get fat.
[304:56.01]I'm not a dietician.
[304:57.03]I just told you I put tahini paste on everything.
[305:01.84]She would probably monkaS when you told her that.
[305:06.44]And yes, I said her because my nutritionist was... I'm like bringing up people in my life.
[305:20.40]I'm like going through people in my life right now.
[305:23.04]The nutritionists, the people that like helped me do things.
[305:27.99]God.
[305:37.38]No, don't eat tahini.
[305:38.46]I never said that.
[305:39.42]It's don't do that.
[305:41.34]Cut the music.
[305:44.77]You should be doing a balanced diet.
[305:47.51]Don't put tahini paste, like a bunch of it on your sandwich.
[305:53.25]It's a bad idea.
[305:55.47]Alright.
[305:56.79]Good.
[305:57.45]Don't do that.
[305:58.65]Eat some peanut butter on a sandwich toast.
[306:01.17]That's what I used to do before bed.
[306:03.05]I would spread peanut butter onto a piece of just regular toast, like a good amount of it, and I would eat that before I would for a late night snack.
[306:11.82]Peanut butter is very dense, very heavy, very calorie dense, but very good for you.
[306:16.15]Get the real stuff.
[306:21.71]Does tahini paste taste good?
[306:23.07]No.
[306:24.75]In hummus, when it's mixed together with stuff, yeah.
[306:26.67]It's just very, very, very thick.
[306:28.69]And very, very, very distinctive.
[306:30.41]It almost like coats your whole mouth and throat.
[306:34.01]It's hard to eat.
[306:43.57]Anyways, good luck to you.
[306:44.86]Seriously, I had a lot of trouble when I was younger.
[306:47.86]10, 15 plus years ago trying to put on weight.
[306:50.60]It's a never-ending battle.
[306:52.54]Just don't do anything unhealthy.
[306:55.79]Because you'll cause more problems than you will fix.
[307:00.88]I wish you luck.
[307:03.60]Hey, Large27, thanks for the 1000 bits.
[307:06.01]No message, just 10 bucks, thank you.
[307:10.79]DinoPulse, thanks for the 500 bits.
[307:14.37]Can you explain the breaking spamming rules problem that chat has?
[307:17.97]They are acting like a hive mind and that's why the art's been depicting them like robots.
[307:23.03]Some of us are human here, not to be rude, just wishing us people in chat would have a much more organic relationship with you, Jerma, like other streamers.
[307:37.75]Uh, what do you mean?
[307:50.26]Organic relationship?
[307:55.20]It's hard to have an organic relationship with anybody when thousands of people are all saying different things at the same time.
[308:09.47]Assimilate the thinker.
[308:19.24]I think that
[308:21.69]I mean, I think it's fun when chat kind of goes off the rails.
[308:28.03]It's fun to see the collective unit doing things.
[308:35.34]But in regards to, like, chat to broadcaster to back to viewer, there's a lot of people here.
[308:46.30]So, there's...
[308:50.88]I don't know what you mean by, like, organic relationship.
[308:52.86]Uh-oh, stinky.
[308:59.58]Why are you guys still writing this?
[309:01.46]It's been like two hours.
[309:06.05]No, I like to enjoy things as a group on Twitch.
[309:11.99]And sure, when I do things like these community nights, we're showcasing single people that make something or do something, but we all collectively enjoy it as a group.
[309:24.20]It's like impossible for me to ever give anybody like personal attention.
[309:30.20]I'm not sure if this is where you're going with this at all, but I prefer it that way.
[309:37.51]This is a meme?
[309:45.35]No, no, no, no, no.
[309:49.48]I like it when we all enjoy things together as a group.
[309:54.90]Because when you start trying to give personal attention to people that are in chat or in the Discord, it's hard to keep up.
[310:06.67]And I've been guilty of doing stuff like this before, trying to like talk to people and see like what's up with this and what's up with that.
[310:12.41]And you kind of get lost because there's a lot of voices.
[310:22.18]So I like to keep my stream like we're all just sitting in a giant auditorium laughing at stuff.
[310:31.32]And then when the lights go off, I put up a giant megaphone that says, Everybody go home!
[310:39.10]Somebody might throw something at me.
[310:40.89]And it's like, hey!
[310:42.45]Fucking asshole.
[310:43.15]And then they run out the back.
[310:51.19]But I like enjoying things as a group.
[310:54.59]Personal attention can get... It can get muddy.
[310:59.51]Especially because considering I don't really know... Really, like, really... Any of you.
[311:08.00]Maybe some of you.
[311:11.20]I like the Borg approach.
[311:18.71]There's people... I've met some of you guys, like, in person.
[311:25.67]Personal attention in parasocial relationships is scary.
[311:31.15]Yeah, I just want to keep expectations completely where I want them.
[311:35.51]And that's auditorium full of people that are collectively all in the same place, enjoying the same things.
[311:48.78]Robots.
[311:51.00]So I was at Target today.
[311:57.00]I love each and every one of you.
[312:00.42]As the unit.
[312:03.42]Look, you ever seen the movie... Okay, we're gonna go on a movie rant here.
[312:09.21]Okay, God.
[312:10.17]Now, I hope you guys understand what I mean.
[312:26.29]I love the community.
[312:29.29]But I'd like to keep it an open, fun community.
[312:33.21]I would never pro- I'm probably never going to be in one of those scenarios where I will... Because sometimes people say, hey, like, you know, this is nothing against anybody at all.
[312:44.58]You know, people be like, hey, I'll be at X. Are you going to be there too?
[312:47.84]And it's like, I, probably not.
[313:01.52]Meetups?
[313:01.98]Oh, no, that's completely different, though, because that's... You know, hey, this is something that I want us to do at this event.
[313:10.34]And go.
[313:15.73]Fine toothpick.
[313:16.67]Yeah, and if you... Look, there's been plenty of people.
[313:20.71]And recently, too.
[313:21.83]This is not just something that happened, like, years ago.
[313:25.73]Within the last six months, people have just kind of flagged me down in random places.
[313:31.76]It has nothing to do with being on stream or anything.
[313:34.10]Not like a gaming event.
[313:35.12]It's just like, hi.
[313:37.48]I'm going to talk to you.
[313:38.46]I'm going to hang out and I'll talk to you.
[313:42.13]So this is not anything to do with that.
[313:46.47]Vegas is huge.
[313:47.19]Oh, yeah.
[313:49.15]It's way bigger than the Boston area.
[313:52.19]In regards to just pure volume and places to go and where you can run into people.
[313:59.49]But...
[314:01.27]I like the madness in chat, to answer that question.
[314:09.13]To a degree.
[314:12.96]To a degree.
[314:19.96]I'm happy that fame hasn't consumed you.
[314:24.54]I think I'm incapable.
[314:30.02]I think I might just be dumb enough to, like, not be capable of that.
[314:34.32]Like, the center of my brain that could, like, turn that on.
[314:37.35]I don't think it's worked since I was, like, fucking 19.
[314:39.07]He's got a really low IQ.
[314:51.22]He always was an egomaniac.
[314:58.84]The karate kid.
[314:59.78]That's right.
[315:00.84]It all turned off.
[315:09.02]I'd love to meet him.
[315:09.84]I'd love to meet you too.
[315:10.72]It'd be great.
[315:12.95]I'm sure it would be really fun.
[315:15.29]But I ain't gonna give out my personal phone number.
[315:26.37]why I don't know anyways uh let's keep going not too much more we have demonic cucumber 250 you should take Etalyx or Kim with you for the next green screen stream and get some double clips for these streams I was gonna bring in a bunch of random stuff but I kind of I kind of it's just I think I want just to be me plus Kim is not she wouldn't want to do that
[316:00.81]Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, there it is again, there it is again, there it is again, there's the ego!
[316:06.28]It's gonna be me and my props!
[316:08.02]Like Carrot Top!
[316:20.17]You know why I wanna do it alone?
[316:22.19]Here's the reason why.
[316:24.17]Because there's something about being in a silent room, alone with a solo camera and a green screen,
[316:32.18]It's weird.
[316:33.50]I like it though.
[316:36.40]It's oddly calming and interesting.
[316:39.84]And then I have like the chat right there.
[316:42.36]It's really, really interesting.
[316:51.09]I gotta get that Jerma Psycho emote because I don't even have a Jerma Psycho emote.
[316:55.75]And it's used more than half the emotes on stream.
[317:06.57]Thank you, Large, for the 500 bits.
[317:09.37]No message, just five bucks.
[317:11.25]Thank you.
[317:14.41]I want to get the... Well, not quite yet.
[317:20.69]Hey, iPod Matt, thanks for the 250.
[317:22.58]Every time someone says pee-pee-poo-poo in chat, it reminds me of my dog, Buster.
[317:27.46]Instead of asking him if he wants to go for a walk, I've always said, do you have to go pee-pee-poo-poo?
[317:40.21]everybody talks like that this is a really really really really cute dog we always show dogs on this stream it's it's it's required reading
[318:12.31]Why is it upside down?
[318:16.15]Oh, there we go.
[318:23.16]Look it.
[318:29.04]Dogs are the best.
[318:31.38]Beautiful dog.
[318:41.22]We had those 40 community subs from Shazo.
[318:45.14]Thank you, Shazo.
[318:47.29]Again, for your 40 subs.
[318:49.99]That's a shitload.
[318:54.13]We also had another 1500 bits from Large, who has a message this time.
[319:01.06]Thank you, Large, for your multiple bit drops here.
[319:03.77]It's my pleasure.
[319:04.27]Thank you, Large.
[319:04.61]Glad to have you on stream this time.
[319:31.13]Thanks for coming and checking it out.
[319:36.21]Thank you.
[319:42.90]Thank you, Pigeon, for the 250 bits.
[319:44.30]Jeremiah, I don't know if this is intentional, but I posted my friend's video between the SCP Scary Discord one and the Rap You're So Precious one.
[319:51.16]If you did this intentionally, I understand, but if not, here it is.
[319:54.96]It's because this is on Twitter.
[320:00.32]Twitter videos is kind of annoying to show on stream So make sure you follow the rules the rules say YouTube or imgur YouTube YouTube imgur imgur
[320:21.25]Twitter is really, really annoying to actually, like, screen cap because it starts off as this tiny little box on the person's page.
[320:28.02]And then if you try to make it bigger, it takes up the whole screen.
[320:33.00]Twitter player is, uh, not so good.
[320:41.05]Yeah, and Twitter autoplay, it's just, yeah, yeah.
[320:44.05]Imgur, YouTube, or in Discord because 99% of the time, I'd say just get it on YouTube.
[320:53.54]It's much easier to cycle through YouTube and have like a YouTube list than it is to have YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, YouTube, Twitter, Twitter.
[321:01.99]It just... The format that I have when I'm tabbing through, it's so much easier for me just to have them on YouTube and Imgur.
[321:12.52]So, that's why.
[321:15.64]And some videos that were uploaded to Twitter actually had a second mirror that was YouTube and that's the one that I used.
[321:25.09]There you go.
[321:31.59]Thank you, Piff Flavor, for the 500 bits.
[321:35.59]Germans want to give you money and say that now 46.3% of my net income is going to you.
[321:41.75]Thanks, you thief.
[321:46.55]Why are you giving me 46% of your income?
[321:53.30]Shave the first number off of that.
[321:58.27]And then I'd still be like, well, you give me that much of your income?
[322:06.23]He wants 6% of all your income.
[322:11.62]No, I just said even that would be like, what the hell's going on?
[322:18.58]It's the 6% Jerma tax.
[322:24.34]Jesus.
[322:27.99]Hey, jbong, thanks for the 250.
[322:33.41]Appreciate it.
[322:36.13]Jeremy, you skipped over content I made.
[322:40.54]Also, five or six things were skipped over.
[322:42.30]Get it together.
[322:44.16]Here's the thing.
[322:47.18]When I'm compiling this stuff, some things are gonna get left through the cracks.
[322:57.31]And whether it's something that I was like, I want to show this, or maybe I'll put it somewhere else.
[323:01.09]Maybe I'll try this at the end.
[323:02.21]Maybe I'll try this here.
[323:07.83]Not everything that's uploaded to the Discord channel is going to be shown on stream.
[323:12.37]It's not as simple as, oh, there were 425 images, so 425 images are going to be shown on stream.
[323:24.10]I'm kind of just trying to compile them and put them in if I have this or too many of these or because remember it I do want these streams to still stick in that you know three to four five you know plus five plus four plus hours so just because it is put in that channel does not mean it's going to be shown on stream I actually should probably put that in the rules too
[323:56.69]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[324:00.02]Because the same thing for like the emote contest too, it's just because somebody put an emote submission in doesn't mean that I was going to show it.
[324:08.00]And there's a potential for, and this is something I thought was probably going to happen with this too, is people could get like annoyed that their submission did not get put on stream.
[324:16.48]But like I said, you have to realize, I can't, it's not just going to be every single submission is going to go get put in.
[324:29.99]But a majority of them will.
[324:34.85]Just not every single one.
[324:38.82]Also time too.
[324:40.26]Because when you see the stream go live that has a community content title, I'm taking all the submissions from that period that I did it last to the day before the stream started.
[324:52.07]So if you're like, oh, what happened?
[324:53.55]What happened to my submission?
[324:54.47]What the fuck is going on here?
[324:55.73]I put this up today.
[324:57.22]That's why.
[324:57.96]It's because it's like the day before so I can start to compile them.
[325:06.83]More tidbits.
[325:13.85]There should be a poll so we can select what he sees.
[325:16.51]No, I'd rather just do it at my own discretion.
[325:19.35]Because then you start, people, there could be like community favorites and people, stuff that I, stuff that wouldn't be considered.
[325:26.57]Wow, that's so good.
[325:28.23]That's so incredible.
[325:30.78]Or, like, oh, that was really low effort.
[325:32.80]A lot of the high effort ones would just be picked.
[325:35.62]And then you would also end up with a bunch of potential, like, meme videos that would just get through because somebody just wrote, uh-oh, stinky.
[325:45.16]Right.
[325:45.48]But in the rules already, it does say that it has to be at least... It has to be related to the channel.
[325:52.69]Like... Uh-oh, Stinky makes no sense for me to play on a community content night.
[325:57.29]It just doesn't have anything to do with the channel.
[326:01.14]It's just a video.
[326:03.78]It even says, like... It's not like I'm not gonna watch Gordon Ramsay.
[326:06.20]He says fuck off a hundred times.
[326:11.15]That's community content.
[326:15.12]No.
[326:16.14]Telling me your favorite movie is Star Wars is not community content.
[326:21.47]Telling me your favorite video is the gnome video is not community content.
[326:29.87]It's like community-oriented content.
[326:35.14]I have never mentioned one time on this stream the uh-oh farting monkey.
[326:42.79]There's just... That has no context to any game I've played, any stream, any... Anything.
[326:51.29]Well, I did... We did today!
[326:53.53]So maybe it'll show up next time!
[327:03.57]So it's only the community if it's about you.
[327:08.65]No, it's just the farting monkey has nothing to do with anybody in this community.
[327:15.14]What does uh-oh stinky monkey have to do with anybody here?
[327:19.54]Other than somebody shared it to you on like Instagram.
[327:23.71]What?
[327:28.25]It's everything.
[327:29.23]It's my life.
[327:35.92]I gotta be careful because now people are gonna start putting that in their videos that they make.
[327:39.55]It has to be about you.
[327:49.02]And this channel.
[327:49.76]And... Um... Is this... Is this like... Is this like Jerma and the Blowfish?
[327:55.46]Or is this Jerma985?
[327:56.76]What's going on here?
[328:22.64]He's a dictator.
[328:29.75]No, long story short.
[328:32.29]This game content that we've played on this stream, green screen content, fan art.
[328:39.11]Guys, originally, alright, hit the brakes for a second, all of you guys that are talking smack to me.
[328:45.70]This was originally gonna be a fan art section of my streams.
[328:52.18]Any farting fucking poo-poo smelly monkeys in the fan art sections?
[329:04.15]I expanded the fan art to do like green screen stuff and like other community-oriented videos.
[329:14.58]Alright, we're moving on.
[329:16.05]We're moving on.
[329:17.61]Long story short, by my discretion, is what I'm gonna be picking to put on stream.
[329:23.97]It has nothing to do with how bad or good content is.
[329:28.70]Art is subjective anyways, that's right.
[329:35.30]The fat Jerma was the uh-oh monkey.
[329:37.48]Alright.
[329:40.20]But it was a picture of me.
[329:42.94]That's... It wasn't just the picture of the monkey.
[329:46.64]They didn't draw the monkey and send it to me.
[329:49.35]It'd be like, why is this monkey here?
[329:57.19]Alright.
[329:58.41]Cease!
[329:58.63]Cease!
[329:59.57]Cease!
[330:07.77]Thank you, Flinzenberg, for the thousand bits.
[330:10.85]Appreciate it.
[330:12.99]Jerma really enjoyed this stream.
[330:14.27]I just want to let you know that I've been watching your content since your old TF2 days, and you're still the only person I'm subbed to.
[330:20.45]Wow.
[330:21.19]That's... How many of you guys only have, like, one sub on Twitch?
[330:34.56]Is it me?
[330:36.85]I saw somebody say me that's not sub to me.
[330:39.41]Who is it then?
[330:42.67]Who are you sub to that's not me?
[330:53.57]I want to know who it is.
[330:57.60]Vinesauce?
[330:59.70]Alright, okay.
[331:00.58]I'll let that one slide.
[331:02.24]Who else?
[331:03.40]Star?
[331:05.56]Okay, I'll let that one slide too.
[331:13.95]Grillmaster.
[331:14.77]Now that's something I cannot... I cannot stand by.
[331:26.29]You guys want to know like the 5000 IQ play for me?
[331:30.47]Make a Grillmaster account.
[331:32.73]Have it be under my name and have subs on it.
[331:35.48]So then people will sub to Grillmaster as like, oh, look, I'm subbing to Grillmaster instead of Jerma.
[331:39.98]Gotcha.
[331:41.28]I own that account.
[331:51.81]Just play off of, hire like an actor to be Grillmaster and stream.
[331:57.25]And it's just like an actor that I've hired and it just all funnels back to me.
[332:05.63]That's a pretty good Disney strat, yeah.
[332:12.58]Some people would be like, oh yeah, fuck you Jerma, I subbed to Grillmaster.
[332:15.32]And I'll be like, what?
[332:16.32]What?
[332:17.16]What?
[332:18.10]Are you serious?
[332:18.80]Get out of here, you Grillmaster asshole.
[332:22.64]Little did they know.
[332:23.96]Little did they know.
[332:28.67]And then other people will be like, yeah, let's go sub to Grillmaster.
[332:31.29]Yeah, they'll get really pissed about that.
[332:33.21]They'll just be like, dude, are you seriously going to do that to me?
[332:47.30]Get out of here.
[332:50.11]Guys, this is bullshit.
[333:06.54]Hey, speaking of people that give their hard-earned money that is never obligated to this stream all the time, that allows me to live this fucking weird, wild life.
[333:20.80]Thank you.
[333:21.26]Here they come.
[333:28.12]And it's a shitload of people.
[333:29.60]How many of you accidentally subbed to me because you wanted to sub to Grillmaster, I wonder?
[333:37.30]Thanks guys, seriously.
[333:43.30]But thank you, that was Flyzenberg.
[333:45.24]For Flinzenberg, for the thousand bits.
[333:50.01]They said they've been watching for a long time since TF2.
[333:52.69]Only person I'm subbed to.
[333:55.43]And they also say, have you ever considered streaming The Wind Waker?
[334:00.12]Maybe eventually we'll do a GameCube week or something.
[334:04.58]Because there are a lot of good games for the GameCube that I passed up.
[334:09.14]I have to play Mario Sunshine.
[334:10.50]Holy shit.
[334:13.18]This is some actual legit classics I've never played.
[334:16.70]Pikmin.
[334:19.02]I have to at least play... Is me not playing Mario Sunshine on stream illegal?
[334:25.70]Like, does hearing that out loud make you guys so angry that it's against the law for me not to do it?
[334:36.74]Alright, put it on the list.
[334:43.36]We'll probably do it eventually.
[334:47.11]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[334:48.59]Another awesome community night.
[334:50.57]There was so much cool shit the community made and I can't wait for the next one.
[334:53.17]I'll probably make more Soul Calibur 6 characters for the next one.
[334:57.41]Any requests?
[334:59.99]Uh, Dr. Schmikeson.
[335:02.42]That's number one.
[335:10.35]For sure.
[335:14.85]This emote?
[335:15.49]Yeah.
[335:15.87]Do the it's me emote.
[335:17.21]That one would be good too.
[335:30.34]We need him on the green screen.
[335:32.03]Now that's not possible.
[335:35.99]I'm sorry to say.
[335:40.97]Yeah, no, I love the stuff that people come up with.
[335:51.94]You know what, maybe... Oh, I will make people very bad.
[335:58.61]What if Bugleberry is on that green screen for like a few minutes?
[336:09.14]I gotta be careful, though, because I'm guaranteed to lose a thousand viewers.
[336:12.40]Or more.
[336:12.72]It's all good, whatever.
[336:20.63]With the reverb... I was... I was... There's nothing I can even do about it now, but thinking back on that, I was like, fuck.
[336:33.38]It's so loud.
[336:38.67]But yeah, definitely Dr. Schmoyvesen.
[336:50.04]Thank you, DoorCube, for the $2.50.
[336:51.04]Did my video get lost or did the mods hate it?
[336:54.38]It's not the mods.
[336:56.89]It's me.
[336:58.65]I didn't hate your video.
[337:00.17]I'm just saying it's me that's making these decisions.
[337:04.19]Based on a couple of internal factors.
[337:08.33]No, you're taking the words out of my mouth and you're putting them in order the way that I said them.
[337:13.59]And adding hate on them.
[337:18.63]No, like I said, I gotta put that in the rules.
[337:21.62]That a submission does not mean it'll be on stream.
[337:28.16]He thinks Coolville sucks.
[337:29.56]It has nothing to do with videos being bad or video... It's just trying to compile an equal amount of things and...
[337:39.73]No, not I might hate your video.
[337:42.32]That's not what this is.
[337:45.80]Sometimes length, how long something is, or the content of the video, it could be anything.
[338:02.09]Have you seen them all?
[338:05.39]No.
[338:06.12]I don't watch the videos.
[338:07.16]What I do is I open them.
[338:10.16]I click, click, click.
[338:11.80]Okay, hold on.
[338:12.64]Let me see right there.
[338:15.18]See the length?
[338:16.06]See the subject matter?
[338:20.64]I go, what is this?
[338:24.20]You judge the book by its cover.
[338:25.46]Yeah.
[338:28.18]That's not how you guys read books.
[338:29.79]I've read all the Lord of the Rings.
[338:30.79]All I had to do was read the first fucking one page on the back and the front.
[338:45.04]Also, something that I... Okay, I'm gonna have to update the rules.
[338:48.60]Because something that... It's like... It's so subjective... That... I have to update the rules.
[339:01.53]Because a lot of submissions would come in that were just clips of the stream.
[339:08.53]Or, like, clips of other people's streams.
[339:17.92]Have mods filter?
[339:22.76]Um... I mean, they kind of already do, in a way.
[339:43.37]He's changing the rules for his benefit.
[339:45.95]Well, also, that's a lot of work, too.
[339:49.41]Hey, Modge, compile like fucking 400 videos for me, and like 200 pieces of artwork, because they can't.
[339:56.63]Because I have to show it on stream.
[339:58.75]So they would have to make new playlists every month, and they'd have to give me like an Imgur file, an Imgur album with hundreds of photos in it and stuff.
[340:09.48]That's too much to ask somebody.
[340:11.82]That's for me to do.
[340:18.74]And they help a shitload for a lot of stuff that you guys don't even know.
[340:30.58]Doorkeeper says, I understand not everything we watch, but if I submit a video and you don't watch it, and I ask you why, there's a variety of factors.
[340:38.63]Um... I'm just gonna update the rules.
[340:43.44]Because right now, it's... I have it for under 10 minutes for videos.
[340:49.53]But it realistically should probably be under 5.
[340:53.45]And I think that was probably what the... I think the video you uploaded was like 5 and a half minutes?
[340:57.55]6 minutes or something, right?
[341:00.93]That's probably what it was.
[341:05.89]Unless for like... Let me try to think of some scenarios where more than five minutes for a community video would be... Maybe in some cases?
[341:25.73]No music videos?
[341:26.77]No full music videos?
[341:28.49]Maybe to... I don't... Guys, this is so early.
[341:30.69]You have to remember.
[341:31.95]Like, this is the second one that I've done.
[341:34.85]So I'm still trying to figure out exactly how these are going to play out.
[341:38.55]But, like, full songs?
[341:42.27]Videos, like, over five minutes, maybe?
[341:44.49]I'm trying to think of what will work.
[341:54.56]Because the bot was getting nuked on some of them.
[341:56.28]Yeah.
[342:00.51]The music-based ones are really good.
[342:01.81]Yeah, that's right.
[342:02.77]I mean, it's... I don't know.
[342:06.58]It's a learning process.
[342:15.50]Just do an empty playlist.
[342:26.98]Do all the music videos last so they get muted together?
[342:31.22]That's a possibility too.
[342:34.34]Are the ones being bypassed considered for next time?
[342:38.12]For the most part, no.
[342:39.28]But there are a few of them that I didn't show that will probably just be on the next one.
[342:43.91]I think DoorCube's yours in particular.
[342:46.49]Because I'm still trying to figure out like length of videos.
[342:58.00]And that was not on the rules at all over the last month or two, so.
[343:07.58]Just write solid rules.
[343:08.74]Well, there are rules there, but here's the thing.
[343:11.63]No one will ever be happy.
[343:13.09]That's just a fact.
[343:13.71]Because if I make a rule that somebody doesn't like, they'll be pissed off about it.
[343:18.99]Don't have videos longer than five minutes.
[343:20.53]Well, why not?
[343:22.31]Don't have videos that are a majority of just, you know, clips from the stream that we already have seen.
[343:31.39]Why not?
[343:38.44]Here come the protesters.
[343:42.32]Ban JoJo videos.
[343:44.21]What if I didn't do that?
[343:45.43]What if I do that?
[343:46.07]What if I didn't do that?
[343:51.12]Ban JoJo videos and dumb clips.
[343:54.46]Do you see what I'm saying?
[343:55.25]Somebody's already writing that.
[343:57.05]Somebody is already writing that.
[344:15.38]Ban my content.
[344:19.93]What I'll end up doing is I'm gonna go through and put in some more... Like, hard rules.
[344:25.92]Because there are only a couple of real hard rules there right now.
[344:28.16]Remember, this is the second time we've done this.
[344:31.23]This is Community Content Night 2.
[344:33.61]Not, like, 30.
[344:34.25]Trying to figure it out.
[344:38.64]As we go.
[344:49.33]Flaccid rules.
[344:57.55]If your submission got bypassed, wait for the new rules to show up.
[345:01.52]Which I will do them later on tonight.
[345:04.28]Probably tomorrow.
[345:05.88]We'll see.
[345:06.22]They'll be there in the next day or two.
[345:08.80]Check through the solid hard rules that I'm going to write.
[345:12.25]And then, bingo.
[345:16.61]Put it in.
[345:24.45]Nice hard rules.
[345:31.90]But to be fair though, there really were only, I think, a handful of omissions.
[345:37.48]Some of them may not have even been intentional.
[345:40.62]You know, of the hundreds of submissions, almost all of them got in.
[345:53.51]And unfortunately, when you're doing a new thing, sometimes something falls through the cracks and somebody's like, what the fuck happened?
[345:58.84]And it's like, let's figure it out.
[345:59.84]And that's what we're doing.
[346:16.22]You need a Jerma985 quality assurance team.
[346:21.33]Yeah, but then it's the mod's fault, right?
[346:25.00]If I give a set of rules to the mods, and then the mods go through and they omit things that are not of the rules, then everybody hates the mods.
[346:34.15]It's just the cycle continues to repeat itself.
[346:51.57]but to end this conversation if something you submitted was not shown check that Discord the pinned message in the Discord channel I'm gonna give like a bang bang bang bang bang rules check your submission do it again but also remember that
[347:17.75]omissions are probably still gonna happen just because... of time and... amount of submissions and... It's not guaran- your video can't ever be guaranteed to be on stream because... What if it gets removed from YouTube?
[347:35.28]That's not my fault.
[347:36.06]I can't be like, it's guaranteed if you submit it with this, it's going to be on the stream.
[347:42.17]There are things out of my control that might happen.
[347:45.65]That I can't guarantee.
[347:50.60]Like, if your video gets, like, removed from YouTube or something, or, like, your channel gets, like, striked... I can't... There's nothing I can do about that.
[348:10.98]Talk to YouTube and use some of your clout.
[348:13.72]If you think, under a hundred million years, that YouTube even has employees that work on a day-to-day basis that listen to fucking content creators...
[348:22.41]There are people with, like, 50 times more subscribers than I do that get, like, the default support letter back.
[348:30.99]That ain't gonna happen.
[348:43.22]But!
[348:45.28]We got two, three more bits to do.
[348:48.48]And we can go to bed.
[348:49.30]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[349:03.04]Where are we?
[349:03.46]Right here.
[349:06.91]Thank you, SpookySpitfire, for the 250 sojourn.
[349:08.67]There are a couple things I have to say.
[349:09.95]First, thanks for you for resisting the uh-oh vid.
[349:13.03]Aside from meme value, it's the bottom of the barrel.
[349:17.01]Second, I honestly haven't even touched Sekiro since the last time I donated.
[349:20.60]I don't know.
[349:23.92]Something about Sekiro just turns me off.
[349:25.54]Also, new ranting.
[349:27.08]DS... New rating.
[349:29.06]Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 2...
[349:34.18]SD2.
[349:36.18]Sekiro.
[349:37.64]Really?
[349:42.63]Dark Souls 2 over Sekiro.
[349:47.98]They're both pretty polarizing.
[349:49.30]I can see that.
[350:01.28]Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls 3.
[350:03.10]I'm not sure I agree with that.
[350:08.64]Third, what video is this?
[350:11.55]It's an old video I did in like high school.
[350:14.55]With friends of mine.
[350:15.91]We've gone over it before.
[350:20.25]We've touched on this video like three or four times now.
[350:24.12]Over the course of the last year or two.
[350:27.90]Pretty weird video, if you ask me.
[350:41.54]Wait, what?
[350:41.98]Is that for real?
[350:42.70]What the hell is going on over there?
[351:08.49]Jerma Ass Stinky Feet.
[351:10.81]You changed your name.
[351:11.63]Thanks.
[351:13.85]You changed it to instead of Has.
[351:15.43]Okay.
[351:16.61]Thanks for the $2.50.
[351:16.97]Hey Jerma, a while ago you said if I didn't donate 46% of my net income to you, you wouldn't be able to afford dog food.
[351:28.03]Is this the same person?
[351:29.17]I feel like these are the same people.
[351:31.61]With two or three different Grillmaster accounts.
[351:33.53]Is that what's going on?
[351:40.20]What's with this 46.3% income thing?
[351:56.91]You are a hive mind.
[351:57.73]That's right.
[351:58.97]Chunky baloney.
[351:59.59]Thanks for the $5.75.
[352:00.09]I know you love this monkey, stinky monkey thing, but please stop talking about it.
[352:06.09]The Jerma brand is better than this.
[352:09.41]God damn it.
[352:12.85]Thank you JBong for the 250.
[352:14.07]Yeah, for the next green screen night, please get some better lighting and camera quality.
[352:19.26]Well, the lights are just the studio lights.
[352:20.74]I can't really move those.
[352:23.14]But the camera will be better this time.
[352:34.41]That's for sure.
[352:43.83]And then DoorCube, thanks for the 250, is touching upon the rules again.
[352:48.61]I will make the rules very, very clear.
[352:50.23]I have in my mind what I want them to be.
[352:56.07]It might take me a day or two to get them up there in the pinned message.
[352:59.80]But just check it out again.
[353:00.72]Your video was the carnival thing, right?
[353:04.76]Carnival and, like, Etalyx, like, talking about me and stuff.
[353:08.72]Right?
[353:09.02]I'm remembering this correctly, right?
[353:16.63]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[353:21.81]Yeah, that one probably should have been shown.
[353:24.79]I must have omitted it.
[353:26.01]I think it was the length, but then it was like 10 minutes was the length and... That'll be shown next time.
[353:31.32]I actually remember that one specifically.
[353:33.86]And like, clicking it and having it on a tab.
[353:39.58]So, it's my bad.
[353:49.16]Shave my eyebrows?
[353:50.00]Why would I shave my eyebrows?
[354:01.42]No, no, the rules need to be hard.
[354:03.08]They do.
[354:03.54]I just, like I said, I had this thing in my brain where it's like... If you give hard rules for stuff about, like, what is, like, art and content, it's like... You start to run that line of...
[354:19.02]How can you even determine what should be allowed and what shouldn't be when it's just like community meme nights?
[354:26.75]It's a hard thing to do.
[354:30.19]Like, know this, know that, know this, do this, keep it under here, keep it over here.
[354:34.15]It's hard to juggle it.
[354:43.20]But... I'm gonna put some legit rules.
[354:52.33]Again, third time's a charm.
[354:54.26]We'll see if we get it right by number three.
[354:56.14]And that's not to say anything was wrong.
[354:57.38]This was fantastic.
[355:00.84]These streams, the last two of these have been fucking amazing.
[355:04.61]But including the people that should be included is obviously a big part of it too.
[355:11.61]I'll get it right.
[355:13.23]I'll get it right.
[355:20.72]Anyways, we are at almost the end.
[355:25.83]Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.
[355:28.13]Jerma, I made you this Jupiter page.
[355:29.79]If someone does a Jupin chat, you can click it to save the Earth.
[355:33.49]Wait, what?
[355:37.22]You can click it to save the Earth.
[355:51.55]No one's done one.
[355:53.67]Click on Jupiter's to save Earth.
[355:55.01]Hold on, I want to get this on stream.
[355:58.54]This is really cool.
[356:04.84]This is cool.
[356:05.88]Uh, is this gonna work?
[356:21.62]Think so Take a look at this do some Jupiter's let's see him It actually works Can I click the maze
[356:51.46]Come on, flood it.
[356:52.46]Let's see it.
[356:53.22]I wanna see more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[357:04.19]Only two?
[357:04.87]Only four?
[357:05.81]You can do better than this.
[357:06.55]Alright, I'm gonna let him come up for a little bit.
[357:15.73]Oh shit, here we go.
[357:19.03]Let's go to slow mode.
[357:21.40]Hold on.
[357:29.54]Go for it.
[357:35.01]There we go, here they come.
[357:40.48]Save Earth, quick!
[357:48.58]This is so stupid, I love it.
[357:51.29]Oh shit, you guys are kind of hammering down right now.
[357:56.33]Nothing's touched Earth though, I've protected Earth flawlessly.
[358:06.86]Alright, alright, let's kill this.
[358:13.35]That's really, really cool though, Lazy Luke.
[358:15.70]Another addition to the Jerma.org website.
[358:19.30]That's good stuff.
[358:23.30]That's really neat.
[358:23.94]Alright, I gotta put slow-mode back to... Um, I don't know.
[358:27.63]10 seconds?
[358:28.11]What was it?
[358:28.35]What was it at?
[358:29.67]5 seconds?
[358:29.99]I have no idea.
[358:36.74]But thank you to...
[358:39.69]Cold Warhol, thanks for the thousand bits.
[358:41.49]They say, thank you so much for showing my art.
[358:42.85]I'm glad you liked it.
[358:44.87]Here's ten bucks for not playing the stinky video.
[358:49.90]I'll take it, thank you.
[358:50.98]And yes, by all means.
[358:54.26]All the artwork was fucking awesome.
[359:07.34]Grillmaster is now hosting you.
[359:10.80]Well, that's not even the right name, so... Nice try, though.
[359:16.04]It's Grillmeister.
[359:22.70]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the thousand bits, Freudian.
[359:26.26]Love and appreciate the streams, as always, man.
[359:27.92]Was pretty low energy this month, so I missed out on this month's community content night.
[359:31.66]But I will try my best to submit some art for next time.
[359:34.46]Can't compare to some of this amazing talent on here, though, but I won't let it deter me.
[359:39.40]Don't be deterred.
[359:47.85]Everything that was shown today had its own value.
[359:51.49]That goes for videos and for art.
[359:57.99]I just gotta work out the kinks and the rules.
[360:02.96]But thank you.
[360:05.98]Hope to see a submission from you soon.
[360:12.80]Hey, Jerma has stinky feet.
[360:14.02]Thanks for the $2.50.
[360:17.02]I already got this one.
[360:17.78]I don't know, because it's the 46% thing again, right?
[360:27.77]Large?
[360:28.27]Thanks for the 500 bits, large.
[360:30.43]They say do it.
[360:31.77]Scream.
[360:32.39]Do it.
[360:32.67]Why would I... I'm not gonna scream.
[360:36.09]Scream.
[360:43.80]Uh, Verdebril Giant, thanks for the $2.50.
[360:45.86]Just want to show you Lazy Luke's game.
[360:47.44]Thanks for the gut-busting stream.
[360:49.94]It was a lot of fun.
[360:51.76]I love this shit more than anything, so.
[360:56.59]Getting to sit back and just watch the crazy shit that you guys do.
[361:09.72]Get lurked on?
[361:10.78]What?
[361:13.73]Well, I'm clicking the link.
[361:19.45]Um... I did actually see this already.
[361:22.23]Because this was submitted today.
[361:26.27]I gotta put that in the rules, too.
[361:27.67]Gotta put that in the rules, too!
[361:34.53]That the day before the stream... I got all the rules already upstairs.
[361:39.59]In my mind.
[361:42.63]I did say this, this is fucking awesome, and it's hilarious.
[361:47.89]But I have to add to the rules that any submission that happens at like 12 a.m., the day of that stream, it's gonna be the next time.
[362:04.12]But, I mean, you're a goddamn founder, so.
[362:09.12]There's only fucking 20 of you.
[362:22.00]Wait, did that work?
[362:25.18]It did not work.
[362:26.10]Why?
[362:28.90]Oh, yes, it did.
[362:34.34]I mean, you're a damn founder, so.
[362:41.73]Do I have a big forehead?
[362:50.17]Oops.
[362:51.29]Wait, go back.
[362:51.88]Go back there.
[362:52.38]Go back.
[362:52.66]Go back.
[362:52.92]Go back.
[362:53.20]Back, back, back.
[362:53.74]Sorry for bumping you twice.
[362:57.22]I do have a big forehead.
[362:58.50]It's glue, man.
[362:59.90]No, I guess I do have kind of a bumpy head.
[363:06.10]It's awesome, though.
[363:06.80]And we're going to show it again next time.
[363:11.14]Thank you.
[363:12.44]And I'll see you guys tomorrow for, I don't know, Dead Rising?
[363:15.03]I don't know, maybe Outer Worlds?
[363:16.93]I don't know, maybe Katamari?
[363:18.45]I don't know, maybe a PlayStation game?
[363:19.75]Who fucking has any idea?
[363:29.33]Could be anything.
[363:35.27]Bath Bomb Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[363:36.71]You gotta make some of this art and merch.
[363:38.79]They're such good designs.
[363:39.94]They are...
[363:41.94]But that's another thing that I want to get right.
[363:44.87]It's really easy just to be like, yeah, we'll do art on some of those.
[363:49.09]And I'm going to sell them.
[363:51.31]But once money becomes involved, you've got to do that shit right.
[363:56.11]You don't want anyone to be unhappy or get taken advantage of.
[364:05.18]It's got to be done correct.
[364:15.39]Double music.
[364:18.01]Is that for real?
[364:18.75]Oh, right, right.
[364:19.49]Yeah, sorry about that.
[364:23.31]And again, I do want to say, if your submission didn't get through, I'm sorry.
[364:30.22]It's hard for me to guarantee submissions.
[364:33.24]But with solid rules, I think that that won't have to be up to, like, my discretion for the moment that I happen to look at it and see what it is.
[364:45.92]So, hold me to that.
[364:48.66]In a couple of days, look at that pin channel.
[364:50.54]There'll be actual real, like, one through eight set of rules.
[365:04.09]Sound good?
[365:05.85]Sound good.
[365:08.21]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[365:14.41]But hold on, but to be fair, to be fair, for the most part, I was referring to the uh-oh stinky monkey being like not eligible for a submission.
[365:30.60]That was where that conversation started.
[365:32.82]Alright.
[365:39.58]Good night.
[365:40.36]I'll see you tomorrow.
[365:45.26]Take care, guys.
[365:48.58]WetWarrior, thanks for the 300 bits.
[365:49.98]They say, do me a favor to have a good one.
[365:51.37]You too.
[365:52.55]Right at the end.
[365:55.41]See you soon.
[366:15.13]Thank you.
