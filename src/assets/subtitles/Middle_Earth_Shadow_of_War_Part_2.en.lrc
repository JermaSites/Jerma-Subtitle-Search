[ve:60.16.100]

[01:11.66]Hey.
[01:14.02]Good evening, everybody.
[01:16.86]I'm a little groggy today, a little tired today.
[01:19.22]I performed one of the most cardinal sins you could ever perform when you eat food.
[01:26.85]I woke up late, and then I got a bunch of food.
[01:32.07]Let me go over a scenario with you guys, because I need to make sure that this is not just a me scenario.
[01:36.39]It's an everybody scenario.
[01:39.80]So, you know when you order food or you make food, doesn't matter if you're like making sandwiches at your house or if you're going to a pizza place or something, right?
[01:48.55]And you order, let's just say you order a chicken broccoli ziti dinner.
[01:54.01]You get it, thank you, here's the money, take care, see you soon.
[01:57.77]You bring it home, and it's a big fucking thing, it's made for like two people, three people, or a pizza, you get like a whole pizza for you.
[02:04.61]And you eat almost all of it, and you get to the point where you can't eat anymore, and you don't want anymore.
[02:11.49]But you look down at your plate, and there's like, there's like only like a baby's handful worth of food in there.
[02:18.93]Or like two baby's hands.
[02:21.41]Two baby hands worth of food.
[02:23.10]And you're like, I don't want to eat that, but I don't want to throw it away.
[02:26.98]And it's not enough for me to put in the fridge.
[02:29.04]What am I going to store?
[02:29.98]Like, that's not enough.
[02:32.26]But it's just enough.
[02:34.26]And you eat it.
[02:35.00]You consume it.
[02:35.76]You eat it because you don't want to fucking waste food or whatever.
[02:38.38]And it's just enough to put you over the edge.
[02:41.08]To the sake of your own body.
[02:45.09]Like, you forsake yourself.
[02:47.95]So right now I'm in that position where I'm just like...
[02:51.80]Oh, like my whole body hurts because I ate the two fucking baby hands worth of food.
[02:56.06]If I didn't do that, I would be fine.
[03:02.07]You know what I'm talking about?
[03:02.79]Good.
[03:02.99]It's a way of life.
[03:03.73]I know.
[03:05.27]I know.
[03:05.59]It's a terrible way of life.
[03:08.59]But I do this all the time though.
[03:11.97]I do this shit with everything, with all foods.
[03:16.98]I will buy foods, or I will buy, like, I'll go to a restaurant and I'll get that dinner, that pizza, that salad, and it's made for, like, three people.
[03:26.63]And I'll get to halfway a normal human being's amount, like a normal serving, and I want more.
[03:34.96]Just enough to, like, I want, like, another couple of bites.
[03:37.80]But I don't want to put it in the fridge.
[03:39.04]I could just store that for later.
[03:41.52]But you tell yourself, you go over these weird, like, mental gymnastics where that's not worth eating.
[03:48.28]Because it's fresh and delicious and buttery right now.
[03:51.20]And if I put it in the fridge, I'm going to ruin it.
[03:53.60]So what do you do?
[03:54.45]You eat the whole fucking thing.
[03:59.39]Leftovers are never as good.
[04:01.51]So that's what you convince yourself is why you're not going to do it.
[04:05.74]Anyways.
[04:09.12]Shadow War.
[04:10.38]Part two.
[04:14.74]Or part three.
[04:16.40]Oh, this might even be like, that's a you thing?
[04:18.16]That's not a me thing.
[04:18.86]Come on.
[04:21.73]But leftovers are good.
[04:23.35]Leftover pasta is great.
[04:24.61]No, it's not.
[04:26.25]Because if you get like a bunch of butter on your pasta, like I do, I'm a butter guy.
[04:30.93]I'm not like a cheese.
[04:32.29]I'm a cheese guy, but not as much as I am a butter and garlic guy.
[04:37.09]Butter and garlic in the fridge turns into this weird like fucking watercolor paste.
[04:45.48]You know when you get like the watercolors and you use it too much and it looks like two or three days later it looks like somebody spit on your board?
[04:52.81]It's this weird gross shit that you don't want to eat.
[05:00.16]Like, I'm happier eating spaghetti with like olive oil on it and butter with some salt and pepper.
[05:07.96]More than I am like Alfredo or red sauce, let's say.
[05:15.75]Anyways, let's keep going.
[05:19.87]For a second I was like, did I like, where did the game leave me here?
[05:22.53]I was like, oh, let's load into the game and it's this guy's face.
[05:28.15]Tomato sauce gets gross in the fridge.
[05:29.53]It does.
[05:30.25]But so does olive oil.
[05:31.23]It gets weird.
[05:35.40]What's down here?
[05:39.22]Well, we instantly came into a grog fight.
[05:42.02]That guy was watching.
[05:43.79]Remind me not to get that close.
[05:49.57]Maybe I will get that close.
[05:56.04]I'm just going after one of the audience members.
[05:58.69]Hey.
[06:01.23]What?
[06:04.73]Didn't I say I wasn't going to get this close?
[06:08.45]Well, one of them is broken.
[06:09.29]I can just take him.
[06:12.53]Let's go.
[06:12.81]Alright, the arena target located in Minas...
[06:17.89]Grom, evil eye.
[06:18.87]I wish I could get the rock throw ability.
[06:20.85]What's that, sir?
[06:21.43]I'm just gonna sit here and step on him.
[06:24.27]We're gonna play hopscotch on this guy's head.
[06:48.41]Can I eat him to kill him?
[06:50.11]Yep, let's try it right now.
[06:55.39]No, not the guy next to him.
[06:58.24]Oh, whatever.
[06:58.70]I crushed him.
[07:06.10]Yeah, where's the taunt button?
[07:07.48]Alright, let's go.
[07:08.80]So can I have two?
[07:10.30]I think I can have two, guys.
[07:11.22]I'm gonna have two giant guys follow me around.
[07:18.46]So this is just going to be like that movie.
[07:21.84]The Big Friendly Giant, except there's two of them.
[07:26.18]That's the sequel.
[07:28.33]Disney presents... The Big Friendly Giant 2.
[07:32.85]Except this time there's two of them.
[07:36.47]Rated R. For intense violence.
[07:41.19]And murder.
[07:44.33]Oh, you're going to have one little orc versus two of my big orcs?
[07:48.60]That's not gonna happen.
[07:54.30]Oh my god, they can actually eat him?
[07:57.18]Wow.
[07:58.25]Alright, let's keep going.
[08:01.29]I forgot what I was doing already.
[08:02.45]Here we go, attract.
[08:07.13]No, no, no, where are you going?
[08:10.39]Over here.
[08:11.35]No!
[08:12.07]Alright, well it was fun while it lasted.
[08:14.20]Let's go.
[08:16.54]Let's go to the arena.
[08:24.52]Spawn a Balrog.
[08:28.80]Can I not make it through this?
[08:31.20]I need to heal.
[08:33.64]Where am I going?
[08:34.24]Where did we leave off?
[08:37.84]Because I need to go to... The arena.
[08:43.37]Whatever the hell that is.
[08:44.31]There it is.
[08:48.33]The arena.
[08:51.27]So can I...
[08:56.15]So how do I go from here to there?
[09:01.19]Do I need to, like, travel back that way?
[09:03.11]That's weird.
[09:09.83]Strange.
[09:10.43]Whatever.
[09:12.73]Because I'm in, like, a different zone now.
[09:19.67]I might have to fast travel back to there, I think.
[09:21.37]I don't think I can bring the Balrog.
[09:23.62]It's not a Balrog!
[09:24.50]It's a Grog!
[09:26.67]It don't matter.
[09:27.03]All their names end in G anyways.
[09:29.79]Barog.
[09:31.11]Grog.
[09:32.43]Og.
[09:33.65]Dog.
[09:34.15]I feel like it's a four-year-old's coloring book.
[09:36.45]Teaching me words.
[09:37.29]Alright, you know what?
[09:43.00]You just go have fun.
[09:44.02]I'm gonna leave.
[09:49.62]You just have fun while you are last.
[09:52.26]Dad's gonna go do a mission.
[09:59.92]Balrog is a Street Fighter character.
[10:02.66]Which character was Balrog?
[10:11.88]What am I doing?
[10:13.76]I can't go in the water?
[10:18.74]He was the boxing guy.
[10:21.21]Well, they were boxing in the very beginning.
[10:22.85]They were punching each other, I guess.
[10:26.77]Okay, can I, let me fast travel.
[10:29.81]Balrog is the one that killed Gandalf.
[10:31.80]No, that's not, that's not who it was.
[10:33.34]Okay, region boundary.
[10:38.32]Boundary.
[10:42.70]Okay, here we go.
[10:45.52]Now, like, get me over here.
[10:46.79]Like, I'm just gonna turn and walk this way.
[10:55.05]Uh, yeah.
[10:56.21]Huh?
[10:59.02]Okay, I can just fast travel to here.
[11:03.74]Balrog is the claw guy.
[11:04.88]No, that's Vega.
[11:08.36]They all have very similar names.
[11:09.88]Let's just take a bunch of continents and throw them in the air and then pick them up on the ground like alphabet soup.
[11:18.88]Here we go.
[11:21.90]So, get... I don't want to go in that far, please.
[11:28.09]I fast traveled here.
[11:29.35]Yes, I can.
[11:32.82]Balrog and Vega aren't remotely similar.
[11:35.28]Yeah, they both have a G in it.
[11:38.16]They both have a G and they both have a fucking vowel.
[11:45.61]Okay.
[11:46.89]Let's get over there.
[11:49.35]Anyways, hi.
[11:51.05]I don't think I even like...
[11:53.07]Your sword didn't kill me, and now I'm gonna carve an arrowhead out of your nose.
[11:59.55]Why does it have to be this guy?
[12:01.98]Honestly, this is the guy that's my nemesis.
[12:04.40]This is the fucking guy.
[12:05.44]He just, he wasn't even there.
[12:07.74]This guy was invisible.
[12:08.70]We walked by this guy, apparently.
[12:12.82]Don't do anything fucking funny here.
[12:19.09]Ranger!
[12:21.06]of my AI loaded into the map while you weren't paying attention.
[12:26.94]Can I throw him off the cliff?
[12:32.12]Alright, we'll see.
[12:34.08]He ain't gonna survive this.
[12:35.84]Let's get him up here.
[12:37.60]Because I'm throwing this guy into hell.
[12:41.36]Or maybe he'll just keep doing that.
[12:42.96]Oh well.
[12:46.08]I'm just glad there's no other people there.
[12:47.33]There's no bodyguards or anything.
[12:56.72]Why does my nemesis have to be like the goofiest shittiest guy?
[12:59.77]No, don't press pause.
[13:11.33]How do I get you to get thrown off the cliff?
[13:13.30]I need to daze him.
[13:18.30]It's not going to work.
[13:19.70]Only broken or dazed captains.
[13:21.08]He's not dazed there.
[13:24.14]Adapted.
[13:26.87]No, no, no.
[13:27.45]No, no, no, no.
[13:28.97]I'm not doing this, guys.
[13:30.25]I promise you.
[13:31.01]I ain't not.
[13:32.43]I want to turn the fucking face cam on because I wasn't doing that.
[13:40.46]Okay, that was fucking cool.
[13:42.12]That was cool.
[13:44.60]Alright, get, throw him off.
[13:50.13]I wanna throw him off the edge.
[13:51.55]Oh!
[13:51.91]What?
[13:52.17]What, what is going on?
[14:08.45]Off the cliff!
[14:09.79]Off the cliff!
[14:12.43]Off the cliff!
[14:13.63]Get him off the cliff!
[14:19.20]Where did he go?
[14:23.16]He's not... Nice acting.
[14:24.62]That was a really nice acting job.
[14:32.56]He just did the thing that they do, they used to do in old movies where the guy pretends to die, but just like a magician's trick, right now he is holding onto the bottom of this rock.
[14:42.51]He is like a spider underneath, holding on with his feet clasped on top as well.
[14:49.07]If I could get the camera to look over there, he would have this funny face where he'd be like, oh shit, he sees me!
[14:58.20]No, he's gone.
[15:00.99]Well, at least we got rid of him.
[15:11.14]Wait a minute.
[15:13.46]Are there binoculars in this game?
[15:17.22]I'm telling you, like, we're gonna see his body and I'm gonna start fucking cracking up.
[15:20.60]We're gonna see this guy's body floating down the river and I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[15:29.17]Let's get a better vantage point.
[15:30.23]Hold on.
[15:38.21]Characters even looking down there.
[15:40.65]No.
[15:41.59]Oh well.
[15:44.04]Medieval binoculars.
[15:45.90]Yeah, where are the binoculars?
[15:48.66]Please don't laugh about the fact that I asked for where the binoculars were.
[15:52.40]Guys, there's a fucking scary guy from like the 1400s living in my body making me able to jump off buildings and slow down time.
[16:02.57]So, what?
[16:03.89]So it's so funny that I asked about binoculars?
[16:07.57]Do you- do you see the moves that I'm doing?
[16:09.37]Do you see this?
[16:11.51]And I'm- and it's funny that I'm- where are the binoculars?
[16:14.40]Like, oh, this is so fucking outrageous, though!
[16:17.02]Nah, that's alright.
[16:18.92]Where's my seeing eagle eye ability?
[16:27.59]Binoculars is a step too far.
[16:29.61]No, it's not.
[16:31.69]Oh, man, imagine him pulling binoculars out of his pants and putting them right in his eyes.
[16:38.35]I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
[16:41.51]He's gonna float down the river.
[16:43.15]What the hell was that?
[16:47.46]Nah, let's go.
[16:47.80]I want the arrows first.
[16:53.18]Oh yeah, just what about like an old-school Galileo device?
[16:57.50]You hold the thing up to your eye and you pull it open like Christopher fucking Columbus.
[17:06.66]Let's just climb up this tower.
[17:15.25]That's perfectly normal, though.
[17:18.79]Jerma, how dare you ask about where a potential zoom in button is.
[17:25.95]Please continue to fucking fly.
[17:31.72]Aww.
[17:35.34]You mean a telescope?
[17:36.22]Yes.
[17:42.36]Am I getting combos for doing that?
[17:45.34]I guess so.
[17:52.22]And let's start the mission.
[17:54.21]Sounds like fun.
[17:56.63]Middle Earth.
[18:01.20]Alright, let's do it.
[18:02.50]The enemy has gathered in the arena and the Witch King issues a challenge to the Grave Walker.
[18:11.09]Galileo studied the sea?
[18:12.61]Um... I think you're thinking of Poseidon.
[18:14.53]He's the one that studied the sea and the ocean.
[18:31.46]You know, like all the old school philosophers and scientists.
[18:34.00]Galileo, Socrates, Poseidon.
[18:45.87]Alright, is this like a Family Guy baby situation or can they hear him too?
[18:57.13]Is he standing there when people can see him or only me?
[19:08.21]Send out the Ranger of the Black Gate to die at the hands of my champion.
[19:18.52]And upon his defeat, your human will be returned.
[19:24.16]So this is a boss fight.
[19:33.82]Did they mention this guy in the books?
[19:37.14]He definitely is.
[19:58.05]Love spectacle if we can distract them in the arena, we can sneak into their camp and find my father Grave Walker, that's what it's gonna happen.
[20:10.42]Give them a show to remember This is fun for not to kill him too quickly
[20:16.39]Anything from this game being in the books is great.
[20:20.93]Nothing is from the... Yes, there is.
[20:23.11]There's Uruks in the books.
[20:25.86]This city existed in the books.
[20:29.92]This guy liked fucking Donatello from Ninja Turtles.
[20:32.49]The new Ninja Turtles is in the books.
[20:38.02]Alright, so which one of the Michael Bay Ninja Turtles am I gonna fight?
[20:41.40]2v1, that's not fair.
[20:42.64]Pretty good heavy impression.
[20:44.78]Quick throw!
[21:05.50]I've played so much Dark Souls and Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 3, that like, you will never hit me with that move.
[21:15.64]Alright, you can stun him.
[21:18.73]Just get on him and then you start stabbing him, right?
[21:21.89]Can I just ram him into shit?
[21:29.53]This might be the dumbest move in the game.
[21:31.48]This might be the goofiest move.
[21:34.06]That's the goofiest movie.
[21:35.68]Fucking when you stand out above the crowd.
[21:38.46]And you shout out loud on his back.
[21:39.90]You know what I mean?
[21:42.91]That's gotta be my favorite one.
[21:53.30]I am strong!
[21:56.66]No, no, no.
[21:57.58]I don't wanna... Just execute him.
[22:03.30]Oh, he's afraid of executions.
[22:06.24]Well... Can I get on his back?
[22:11.02]Alright, here we go.
[22:11.72]Does this kill him?
[22:19.04]Or is he gonna keep walking after this?
[22:24.56]What more do you want?
[22:25.32]So wait, hold on.
[22:28.45]He's scared of executions, but he's enraged by wounds.
[22:33.21]I don't know if I understand this one, like, I don't understand this character correctly.
[22:36.99]Alright, kill him.
[22:42.08]Mm-hmm.
[22:42.42]And through it.
[22:43.36]In face.
[22:45.30]Cut his body parts off.
[23:02.81]And in the back.
[23:03.59]Twist it.
[23:04.03]Get him in the kidney.
[23:07.37]Aslar of the beasts.
[23:09.01]Feral berserker.
[23:10.83]Should I dance with him?
[23:12.51]Let's do it again.
[23:13.89]Taunt the crowd.
[23:30.82]Oh, you actually do talk through it.
[23:34.36]Like, screaming.
[23:42.08]Somebody, some asshole from the top row is going to jump over.
[23:48.28]There he is.
[23:51.98]Wait.
[23:52.30]This is what you... Who are these people?
[23:54.42]Don't tease me, Tom.
[24:09.87]Some fat guy... Some fat guy walked into Home Depot and took the first sledgehammer off the rack.
[24:19.11]And then came into the arena.
[24:22.25]And then brought like a bunch of his friends and they all are gonna die here.
[24:25.43]That's the sad part.
[24:33.41]So he does like a little dash.
[24:40.44]And YUP!
[24:47.02]Ooh! Ooh!
[24:50.42]Too many hits.
[24:52.28]Wow, what am I thinking here?
[24:53.89]You know how much Dark Souls I've played?
[24:55.75]How am I doing this?
[25:08.74]Like, imagine if Dark Souls, every time an enemy swung at you, you got like two seconds to plan what you wanted to do for a dodge.
[25:17.48]And even still, I had some trouble.
[25:28.72]Hey.
[25:29.54]Hey.
[25:35.72]Oh, they just keep pouring out.
[25:37.44]Guys, if we doxel, look how cool I am.
[25:40.63]I mean, you're not wrong.
[25:43.09]I do say that often.
[25:47.81]He threw that at somebody else.
[25:49.89]That guy threw that at someone else.
[25:58.83]Thankfully for me.
[26:00.67]Can't even fucking conk loss.
[26:08.23]See?
[26:09.10]Right in the back of that guy's head.
[26:16.82]Hi.
[26:23.95]Those ground executions take a long time.
[26:28.21]I'm better off seriously just doing this.
[26:30.25]Really.
[26:30.75]Like, watch.
[26:32.75]Told you I was a bow guy.
[26:38.61]That's, no, that's fucking, that's every shot was a kill there.
[26:41.55]That's why they call me Jerma.
[26:43.71]Jerma, Bob the Bowman, Elbertson.
[27:05.57]No, not the guy on the ground.
[27:08.19]The big guy.
[27:09.19]The scary guy.
[27:15.87]Bob, no, no.
[27:16.56]Bob the Bowman.
[27:18.04]I made a Lord of the Rings reference.
[27:19.52]Don't we know that?
[27:20.44]You're supposed to be fans of Lord of the Rings.
[27:22.52]Let's get back over here.
[27:39.74]Bard the Builder.
[27:40.84]Bard- No.
[27:41.80]Bard the- Bard the Bowman.
[27:44.34]I didn't say Bob, I said Bard the Bowman.
[27:46.30]This guy?
[27:49.23]My nemesis.
[27:49.91]Crush his face.
[27:51.75]Woah, he's fucking sprinting over here.
[27:55.49]I have a new skill.
[28:11.54]What are you doing?
[28:12.48]Enraged by- What are you enraged by?
[28:13.99]Oh.
[28:17.79]Somebody just fell down the- Okay.
[28:20.11]Alright.
[28:20.99]Okay!
[28:21.91]Okay, can you please?
[28:23.93]Oh, fuck.
[28:27.47]I gotta open up some of these Karagor cages.
[28:30.37]I'm like a master of en- I was angry at that guy.
[28:34.71]Break open the Karagor cages.
[28:36.88]Let's cause a little fucking mayhem.
[28:40.92]Dazed.
[28:49.88]Shag him.
[28:52.08]Shag him.
[28:54.88]Yeah, yeah, everybody gang up on him.
[28:56.30]Remember how mean this guy was as your boss?
[28:58.69]All the shit he said to you.
[29:00.51]All the overtime you had to clock without being paid for it.
[29:03.93]Take it out on him, boys.
[29:06.83]That's right.
[29:08.85]Keep it up.
[29:11.11]Fucking horrible bosses.
[29:13.63]Horrible bosses too.
[29:15.33]Kill him.
[29:18.46]Does this actually work?
[29:22.35]We all fucking can't, we all don't like, uh oh.
[29:24.83]No, all jokes over.
[29:30.92]Holy shit, he doesn't stop.
[29:32.32]He doesn't stop.
[29:35.54]Oh my god, dude, like he's just like latching to me.
[29:38.60]Why does he have my special moves?
[29:40.04]That's bullshit.
[29:45.11]Last time we mixed it up all my employees started stabbing me Alright, well, thanks good to know I Need the camera.
[30:04.07]How do I like why how do I spin the camera out faster?
[30:06.09]Remember I told you what did they tell me?
[30:10.43]Why is he dazed?
[30:13.12]Hold on, that guy's... That guy said like three sentences and got really tired.
[30:20.70]Oh, man swine.
[30:22.30]So we meet again.
[30:24.19]And I'm gonna go off on a little bit of a tangent and then I'm tired now.
[30:29.43]I'm dazed.
[30:32.51]Shit, I need arrows.
[30:34.13]Shit, come on.
[30:35.03]This is like a horror movie.
[30:36.39]I gotta kill Jason.
[30:43.49]Wait, where is he going?
[30:45.33]Alright, let's do it again!
[30:52.33]Kill him!
[30:55.31]You know all that fucked up shit this guy said about your kids?
[30:58.75]And your wife?
[31:00.81]Let him have it!
[31:04.02]No!
[31:04.98]No shit!
[31:07.64]He's still dazed though.
[31:08.76]This guy sucks.
[31:12.39]It's worth it.
[31:12.91]Get out of here!
[31:15.81]We need to get in a better spot.
[31:17.93]Oh sh- No, no.
[31:25.20]He's gonna die by this.
[31:26.18]This is how I'm gonna kill this guy.
[31:27.50]You understand?
[31:28.00]Let's heal.
[31:32.62]He'll get dazed again, don't worry.
[31:33.72]This guy's an idiot.
[31:38.73]He's enraged by injury.
[31:47.63]One stray idiot.
[31:48.56]Perfect.
[31:53.02]Okay.
[31:53.40]Alright, how do I... Oh, he's dazed.
[31:56.30]He's dazed.
[31:59.36]We gotta get in the corner where I'm not gonna get, like... I think the game doesn't recognize... Alright, I think I figured it out.
[32:07.05]I think I figured out how to break this encounter.
[32:09.40]Yeah, pretty much.
[32:10.84]See, I'm pressing X when they swing, so it tries to start the animation and it's just not gonna start.
[32:15.65]So, the game doesn't understand any of that.
[32:19.57]It just thinks that I'm trying to stab him, so it keeps him dazed.
[32:23.09]So eventually, they're gonna fucking kill him.
[32:25.30]I just gotta stay in this spot.
[32:28.34]NO, YOU FUCKING BLEW IT!
[32:30.50]The one guy!
[32:34.56]The one guy, the one hero!
[32:39.02]Oh, god damn it.
[32:41.56]Come on!
[32:46.80]The one guy on the fucking left.
[32:49.61]I'll get it, don't worry.
[32:51.03]It's gonna happen.
[32:51.81]You guys don't think he's gonna die like that?
[32:59.99]He's dazed.
[33:02.81]Why does he keep getting dazed?
[33:04.82]I don't understand this part.
[33:07.31]Right when he stops being gazed.
[33:08.97]That's fucking, that's fucking great.
[33:11.93]Don't worry, it'll happen again in a minute.
[33:18.94]And, like, make sure, like, when you're watching this video, like, you gotta, like, queue up, like, the bosses thing.
[33:23.44]Like, you gotta use that joke.
[33:28.06]Just pretend that's, like, what I said.
[33:29.93]Like, right when he dies.
[33:31.37]These days, no.
[33:32.03]These days, no.
[33:35.21]Actually, I could do a little bit more damage to him.
[33:38.02]He's immune to arrows.
[33:41.30]This guy's immune to everything except for his own men's swords.
[33:50.44]Get dazed.
[33:56.83]Why was he getting dazed by everything before?
[33:58.83]What is it?
[33:59.57]Is he nearsighted?
[34:00.69]Oh no, I'm dazed now.
[34:11.01]I mean, like, really?
[34:13.85]What the fuck?
[34:17.84]Did I just stealth attack this guy?
[34:19.82]Okay, don't hurt him anymore.
[34:22.50]He's dazed by stealth.
[34:23.44]Perfect.
[34:24.88]Alright, welcome to horror- Don't attack!
[34:31.29]Alright, I got him!
[34:34.89]Here we go.
[34:38.13]Come on.
[34:38.75]Come hit your boss.
[34:40.01]Remember all those mean things your boss said about you?
[34:42.76]Here's the fucking funny joke.
[34:48.06]No, I don't want one guy to do this.
[34:49.88]Think of all the terrible things.
[34:51.14]Think of all the torture this guy's put you through.
[34:54.44]Only one of you cares?
[34:56.54]Why?
[34:57.12]No, don't sneak up behind me.
[35:03.06]What happened to all the guys sprinting in and hitting him at the same time?
[35:09.50]Can he die from this?
[35:18.78]Oh, god dammit.
[35:22.85]He's dead, fuck it.
[35:24.45]Uh, I guess he has to say his final words.
[35:34.89]I couldn't see this one coming.
[35:37.99]Alright, that was fun.
[35:43.27]Oh, no, I couldn't have seen that coming from a mile away.
[35:47.41]This guy doesn't have a very good scream voice.
[35:55.53]You know, um, Brock Lesnar?
[35:56.75]You've seen, like, the Brock Lesnar scream compilation?
[35:59.28]Much better.
[35:59.72]Oh!
[36:13.75]Does he say they transitioned into the other actor's scream voice because it was way better?
[36:23.40]No, that was good.
[36:25.22]The first one was not that great.
[36:43.64]But Brock Lesnar has a terrible scream voice.
[36:46.32]If you get an opportunity, go look at a Brock Lesnar yelling compilation.
[36:55.30]Aeglos.
[36:55.60]Web of Fate.
[36:56.02]This is just story stuff.
[36:56.82]Somebody else will read it.
[36:58.26]I have a skill point, though.
[37:12.75]Okay, perfect counter.
[37:14.54]I already have this, right?
[37:15.94]Yeah.
[37:17.64]Gain might from each counter.
[37:19.06]That's a pretty big deal.
[37:19.86]Well-timed counters replenish an elf shot.
[37:24.24]While undetected, you gain might.
[37:27.03]Successful sword strikes gain much more might.
[37:29.55]Might fully resets after you take damage.
[37:31.27]Miss an attack or exit combat.
[37:32.53]Okay.
[37:35.03]I mean, this is a pretty... It's pretty good.
[37:42.33]I have to activate it.
[37:43.31]So you only get to do one of these.
[37:46.45]Okay.
[37:48.07]That's fine.
[37:54.39]I do have stuff in my inventory we gotta look at.
[37:56.17]A couple of new S-words.
[38:00.19]Uh, this is 41.
[38:00.71]41.
[38:00.77]I can upgrade this.
[38:02.61]Okay.
[38:02.93]Okay.
[38:11.04]That was only 25 cents, so don't, that wasn't like a waste or anything.
[38:15.18]So I got a livable melee and recover full health and might after a last chance.
[38:18.67]That's a pretty big deal.
[38:22.65]Um, setting me on fire.
[38:27.23]That's pretty cool, but how often does a crit happen in this game even?
[38:30.81]Whatever, just delete it.
[38:34.20]Six might when it stays, no, cares.
[38:38.53]These are all just terrible ranger swords.
[38:43.40]Classic pay to win.
[38:47.40]I mean... I mean, you're not wrong.
[38:51.50]Okay?
[38:54.17]I'm gonna... Let's make a better gem here.
[38:57.27]15% increased damage.
[39:00.75]I'd rather have that.
[39:02.35]Let's unlock the... I mean, that's a thousand bucks.
[39:04.67]Like, but seriously.
[39:05.82]Like, I'm gonna have to do this all anyways, eventually.
[39:09.06]So I might as well just start spending it now.
[39:12.96]And these... 231.
[39:13.70]Why... Use quick throw to hit an enemy on fire?
[39:21.03]Quick throw lights enemies on fire every 30... Eh.
[39:23.09]But this one's way more damage.
[39:28.57]Uh... I'll be able to... I can upgrade that one.
[39:33.13]So I'm going to try to quick throw somebody.
[39:37.76]Patamon is only a problem in multiplayer games.
[39:41.42]Yeah, I mean... Like, that's also a correct statement.
[39:48.43]We'll do the money for the stealth kills.
[39:50.17]I feel like that makes more sense.
[39:55.59]Headshot a poisoned enemy.
[39:59.27]I don't want any of these.
[40:05.21]No, I don't want it.
[40:08.88]It's all about, like, people being on fire and curses.
[40:11.00]No, just get out of here.
[40:13.47]I'm gonna get some shit from a box anyways, alright?
[40:19.59]Now this is all new.
[40:23.00]I can upgrade this though.
[40:23.94]70% chance that a critical hit lights enemies on fire.
[40:26.48]This is just much more.
[40:27.42]Like, why would I ever not have this on?
[40:30.90]And we're gonna break down these other ones.
[40:38.98]Health, right?
[40:40.88]Curry's max health by 15%.
[40:42.88]But let's combine the gems we have.
[40:50.60]God.
[40:52.10]They really went, like, nuts with the gear in this game, huh?
[40:54.18]They all, like, did different rarity tiers.
[40:59.27]Well, I don't want any of these.
[41:00.19]Because I have three legendaries.
[41:01.87]Okay.
[41:10.03]This is Darkest Cloak, Raider's Cloak, and the one I have on now.
[41:23.33]I'm going to hold on to these because I already have this when I complete this upgrade.
[41:29.09]Increased poison damage to enemies by 18%.
[41:31.47]50% increased skill.
[41:34.57]50% increased damage dealt by beast allies.
[41:36.71]Well, I don't know why I didn't have that on.
[41:38.08]This is like the beast one.
[41:43.71]I mean, no, they all do that.
[41:45.09]No.
[41:47.87]Well.
[41:49.85]Put in the health.
[41:55.47]Use the mustard cape.
[42:00.25]Yeah, I fucking clogged up my toilet.
[42:01.85]Alright, let's do it.
[42:04.10]I already know what the warrior gem does.
[42:06.14]I know what it does.
[42:09.16]So.
[42:10.76]Let's go...
[42:14.01]Let's continue.
[42:16.69]Online Vendetta.
[42:18.09]Revenge of the Death of True.
[42:21.51]Let's go here before dawn.
[42:26.82]And fast route.
[42:29.74]Is Og still... Oh wait, Og is still alive?
[42:31.84]No, he's not.
[42:32.68]Is he?
[42:42.25]He was over here somewhere.
[42:44.27]Can we find him?
[42:45.01]Is he in the actual orc map?
[42:48.97]The army map?
[42:51.83]He is still alive.
[42:56.02]He actually is still alive.
[42:58.84]Wow, you guys weren't kidding.
[43:02.72]And he's right here.
[43:04.06]Alright, let's get him.
[43:08.72]Why did I just get $2,400?
[43:12.42]Was that my, you've been offline?
[43:14.28]Here's your offline amount?
[43:16.44]What?
[43:17.64]I just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[43:32.15]Well, I freed you guys.
[43:33.89]Good work.
[43:38.22]What is going on over here?
[43:44.30]Backstab him.
[43:45.32]Hey, what are you doing?
[43:47.94]Why are they all just hanging out together?
[43:51.84]I'm so confused.
[43:57.68]People are running?
[44:00.42]Why are they running?
[44:01.26]Come here, let's get some fucking intel.
[44:08.60]Distracted again.
[44:09.40]That's just the name of the game.
[44:10.32]Alright, I want you to do... You know what I want you to go do, buddy?
[44:13.24]I want you to go give a death threat to Og.
[44:21.99]Tell him I'm coming for him.
[44:27.93]That's the guy I just told to go do it.
[44:29.28]Alright.
[44:33.98]I gave him a death threat.
[44:37.06]We're going for Og.
[44:43.47]Ow.
[44:45.53]I'm surprised that didn't hurt more than it should have.
[44:47.77]You know what?
[44:49.97]I want you to do the same thing.
[44:52.60]Go tell Og.
[44:54.50]Oh, he already has a death threat on him.
[44:55.86]Never mind.
[45:00.34]Let's just get some intel on random people.
[45:03.52]Hoshgrish.
[45:06.32]I need fire.
[45:12.22]Get the fuck out of here.
[45:16.19]I need to shoot the thing to blow up a hog.
[45:20.37]He is a very, very, very far, far, far away land away.
[45:25.21]I need my dog.
[45:27.59]Come here.
[45:30.98]No.
[45:31.10]Poisonous Terror Trickster.
[45:42.05]Alright, that was a foolish thing to say.
[45:53.47]I wouldn't have done that if you didn't have a fucking hype man behind you.
[45:57.35]That's what he gets.
[46:03.00]We don't play nice.
[46:04.12]Yeah, listen to my boss.
[46:05.44]He's really cool.
[46:07.64]That guy's instantly dead.
[46:10.13]That was still kind of slow motion, so that guy didn't even get to say.
[46:14.65]He finished his sentence and didn't even know he died.
[46:16.87]Yeah, that was Gaston LeFou.
[46:22.38]Except in this Disney movie, LeFou gets murdered.
[46:32.02]Oh, no one laughs like Gaston LeFou.
[46:37.96]Oh, I was trying to fucking blow that up.
[46:42.90]And no one else is incredibly thick like Gaston.
[46:49.07]It's invigorating.
[46:58.18]You did well.
[47:02.68]Draw out Og the Shadow by killing his savages.
[47:05.10]Reward 1067 experience.
[47:08.78]Og is not far.
[47:18.11]Kill Ogmen.
[47:20.71]Alright, boys.
[47:22.81]Let's go.
[47:23.23]You guys just came out of the camp.
[47:27.47]I don't know if I should trust you guys.
[47:30.95]Give us a sneak ability.
[47:32.39]Come on.
[47:32.77]Sneak around.
[47:44.53]All three of them contemplated walking into the fire.
[47:46.59]Did you see that?
[47:50.83]They all walked up to the fire individually.
[47:54.05]We're doing a really bad job sneaking.
[48:00.13]Let's get this one guy over here.
[48:06.72]Come over here.
[48:13.34]Why are they so scared?
[48:17.14]Everybody is terrified.
[48:18.38]Why?
[48:20.44]Whatever this thing is over here.
[48:21.88]Oh, I'm eating it.
[48:23.94]Oh, shit.
[48:25.04]There's a bad guy.
[48:26.66]Oh, boy.
[48:27.88]That guy's putting his hands up.
[48:32.08]That guy's surrendering.
[48:41.56]Oh, I hear loud noises.
[48:43.10]Is that Og?
[48:43.84]No.
[48:45.16]That's just the fucking aliens from Futurama and The Simpsons.
[48:48.46]And we will come take over your planet!
[49:09.90]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[49:15.00]Alright, stun him.
[49:17.54]Stunning.
[49:19.10]Stunning.
[49:27.50]Ow.
[49:30.24]Do it.
[49:33.69]I need to get... Alright, fuck it.
[49:34.73]Let's just build a combo here.
[49:44.25]Right in the back, come on.
[49:48.81]I'm gonna kill... Alright, I need to be killing like these guys.
[49:53.41]Not like cause a problem.
[49:56.15]Elephant Rage.
[50:05.16]Like a synchronized swim.
[50:07.10]Got it!
[50:17.52]He's dead here, no?
[50:23.53]There it is!
[50:23.99]Now we are from Omicron, pussy, I hate!
[50:30.45]And then that noise happens!
[50:33.13]Oh my god, please.
[50:33.81]Oh my god, please, sir.
[50:37.73]Sir!
[50:47.58]I can't really do anything right now.
[50:49.26]I'm getting stunlocked.
[50:50.22]I have to stun those guys, but this guy's got to die.
[50:56.30]Oh, God.
[51:04.86]I killed him by shooting him in the asshole.
[51:06.66]So, bye.
[51:09.85]No, no, no, no, no, don't run, don't run.
[51:11.39]I have to kill you guys to get Og to come out here.
[51:13.83]Oh, shit.
[51:14.67]No, get over here.
[51:16.49]Get... There's two.
[51:24.26]Come here.
[51:25.50]Get... No!
[51:29.74]No, get back, get back, get back, get back.
[51:31.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:39.21]No!
[51:39.69]God damn it.
[51:42.43]It's alright.
[51:42.81]There's definitely at least... There's got to be five more guys in there, right?
[51:49.73]That's a huge guy.
[51:55.08]What the hell did I just do?
[51:57.86]Nice entrance, and now I'm going to get in trouble.
[52:06.66]That's six.
[52:09.78]I definitely don't want that guy alive.
[52:15.96]Don't.
[52:16.78]Please, please, please, please.
[52:19.88]You do have to die though.
[52:20.88]And now there's two of these guys.
[52:24.26]When are all four Ninja Turtles going to come out, I wonder?
[52:26.22]I don't want to blow that thing up because I want to kill that.
[52:28.72]I want Og to die instantly.
[52:33.65]No L-Shot.
[52:34.21]Fuck.
[52:43.79]That was very majestic.
[52:48.43]Alright, here we go.
[52:51.89]Time to ride... Time to ride Donkey Kong.
[53:00.66]Into the fire!
[53:01.38]Got one.
[53:09.18]Steady.
[53:10.50]That didn't do anything.
[53:14.51]Again?
[53:15.11]No!
[53:16.43]Get on his back, get on his back, his back, his back.
[53:17.95]Come on.
[53:18.57]Get on his back.
[53:27.71]This is the worst move.
[53:30.01]It's so goofy, but it's fun to do, I guess.
[53:36.61]Alright, my dog's here now.
[53:42.33]comes up.
[53:44.05]Og is arrived.
[53:47.33]Og the Shadow.
[53:47.95]He's walking right by Barrel.
[54:19.48]Die.
[54:21.40]That's it.
[54:22.32]He's dead.
[54:24.22]That guy's dead.
[54:25.38]I win.
[54:30.11]And then the rest of your lot.
[54:40.80]Just blow the whole building.
[54:45.02]Let none survive.
[54:48.00]What the fuck?
[55:00.24]Jesus.
[55:08.29]Oh my god.
[55:11.57]Don't do, don't do, whatever you're doing, don't do that.
[55:18.40]No, no, we gotta do this shit again.
[55:19.60]We gotta do the fucking laugh out loud thing.
[55:24.76]No, no, not my grog!
[55:26.56]This is the funny shit!
[55:37.54]Come on, do it again.
[55:38.36]Oh, no.
[55:42.65]I got too cocky.
[55:51.08]Detonate it.
[55:56.93]Oh, he's lighting the building on fire.
[56:04.83]Oh!
[56:10.04]This guy's immune to weakness.
[56:12.52]He's fine by me.
[56:13.68]He's weak to fire.
[56:15.96]Weak to shooting arrows at his face.
[56:19.44]Whatever I was trying to say.
[56:23.40]What if her words were trying to come out of my mouth?
[56:24.85]That's what they were.
[56:33.73]Get on his back again.
[56:34.61]Ride him around like a fucking pony.
[56:41.57]I gotta end this with a headshot in the face.
[56:48.85]Get up here.
[56:49.29]I want to be right in his face.
[56:54.01]Somebody... Some captain's followers bring war banners into battle.
[56:58.45]War banners inspire nearby orcs causing them to attack more aggressively.
[57:01.53]Destroy the banner to stop the effect.
[57:03.33]No, get off of this!
[57:06.19]What are you doing?
[57:07.15]Get down!
[57:12.31]I'm trying to destroy his stupid fucking horn and it didn't do anything.
[57:16.34]Why'd they... Why's he coming in bees?
[57:23.65]He did when he stepped on a hornet's nest?
[57:26.15]I've done that before, it sucks.
[57:28.89]Bees!
[57:30.27]Bees everywhere!
[57:39.18]He actually is, like, running so goofily.
[57:41.90]Oh no!
[57:42.76]Oh no, he's still behind me!
[57:44.94]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[57:47.45]Oh no!
[57:48.83]Is he still there?
[57:56.25]He's gonna run into something.
[57:57.37]It's gonna be perfect.
[57:59.68]This guy's running faster than me.
[58:02.24]Get him!
[58:04.84]Get him!
[58:05.32]Get that one!
[58:06.46]Don't let him get away.
[58:10.09]No, another troll.
[58:11.45]Oh, come on.
[58:12.03]Fucking... beetles with orange, like, leather armor on.
[58:14.01]Don't let that distract you.
[58:16.31]That's fake news.
[58:18.19]Get over here.
[58:19.09]Don't let that distract you.
[58:41.21]Don't let him get... Where are they?
[58:42.31]Are they fighting over there?
[58:43.19]Where does he end up actually going?
[58:48.29]And how far is he going to run?
[58:57.54]Independent streamer.
[59:00.44]It's just a joke.
[59:01.68]I'm just kidding around.
[59:03.12]He's going to despawn.
[59:09.52]What if I poison a nearby barrel?
[59:10.86]Will he stop and have a drink?
[59:15.94]I'm gonna run in front of him.
[59:17.81]And we're gonna poison him.
[59:24.09]No, now he's going the other way.
[59:25.73]Oh, fuck me.
[59:26.43]Yeah, I do.
[59:27.17]This is the horrible boss, by the way.
[59:29.17]That's horrible bosses.
[59:37.29]Alright, I'm done playing around.
[59:38.61]This guy's dead.
[59:39.45]I'm just getting like five captains.
[59:45.87]Five captains are like on my back.
[59:49.16]Okay, here we go.
[59:59.90]Oh, get it!
[60:01.32]Damn it, did I hit him?
[60:04.24]Fuck.
[60:05.06]No, and there's another guy here.
[60:06.78]Wait, is that the one from before?
[60:09.70]Was that guy just going back to his normal duties?
[60:11.80]I think that's what was going on.
[60:14.06]Yeah, that was the guy that was on the bridge.
[60:22.37]Alright, here we go.
[60:23.79]Three, two, one.
[60:26.15]Damn it!
[60:26.57]No, get the bees on him!
[60:27.57]Get the bees on him!
[60:30.26]I had a choice and I made it.
[60:37.02]This is just getting tiring now.
[60:38.78]I just want to blow him up.
[60:44.65]Well, that's the first time we've seen him jump.
[60:46.65]There's another one.
[60:53.44]Oh, he's in a corner now.
[61:00.68]One of my guys showed up.
[61:09.70]Can I grab him?
[61:10.58]You're telling me he's not broken right now?
[61:21.28]What?
[61:22.52]Oh, god damn it!
[61:25.13]No!
[61:26.37]Oh my god, please.
[61:28.09]Why?
[61:28.85]I just wanted to blow him up.
[61:33.86]What the fuck?
[61:35.12]Okay, they were executing those guys.
[61:37.22]This guy is fucking serious.
[61:44.31]Where is he even running to?
[61:47.17]Oh god damn it.
[61:48.79]Wait!
[61:59.16]I didn't do anything.
[62:02.74]I didn't do anything.
[62:04.10]He did that himself, and he's still alive.
[62:07.32]Oh god damn it.
[62:10.84]Oh god, come on.
[62:15.54]He's gonna end up tripping over something.
[62:20.96]This is fucking embarrassing, yeah, for him.
[62:26.35]I didn't know the Lord of the Rings was such a fucking mess.
[62:32.06]I know, like, honestly, this is embarrassing.
[62:36.46]Shit, there was a lantern there.
[62:39.94]No, wait, wait!
[62:43.76]He's immune to executions.
[62:50.42]Alright, we've had our fun.
[62:51.82]It's time for this guy to die.
[62:53.78]It's game over.
[62:56.12]I'm gonna kill him.
[62:58.20]He's gonna get an arrow in the face.
[63:03.74]Get over here.
[63:04.30]Alright, it's time to end it.
[63:08.99]I just gotta get a good shot of this.
[63:17.79]Come here!
[63:19.21]I wanna get a good fucking view!
[63:25.19]That was gonna be the end.
[63:27.07]And now I have to... No, no, no.
[63:33.85]Stop it, please.
[63:35.59]Did he get away?
[63:36.71]He didn't get away.
[63:37.47]I gotta get a bird's eye view.
[63:38.49]Get over there!
[63:39.81]Don't let him get away!
[63:41.64]Don't!
[63:42.98]Don't go!
[63:43.94]Use your fucking Super Mario moves!
[63:45.38]Don't!
[63:45.62]No!
[64:16.58]He did a final juke and ran the other direction.
[64:21.66]I was gonna turn off the HUD.
[64:22.98]It was gonna be an elaborate thing.
[64:29.62]Whatever.
[64:30.79]Don't fucking really... Can I... Why did that work?
[64:45.89]No, dude, seriously, get out.
[64:47.75]I'm trying to dodge.
[64:49.92]Can you save my life?
[64:51.36]Give me like a fucking red potion.
[64:55.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[64:57.80]I don't think these guys, these guys can't fall off.
[65:05.43]No, they can't fall off.
[65:07.73]I don't think even these guys can get a shot off.
[65:11.45]We'll see.
[65:14.11]One of you guys is gonna hit.
[65:15.07]Now we're fucking stuck here.
[65:16.59]Because I need to see.
[65:17.57]There's one guy in the front.
[65:21.58]Are they gonna climb up here like fucking Spider-Man?
[65:23.96]Alright, what about my dog?
[65:25.82]Alright, my dog can come up here too.
[65:27.48]That's good.
[65:29.82]We're waiting this out.
[65:34.37]Are they climbing the sides?
[65:37.77]No.
[65:42.60]Alright, I'm done.
[65:43.36]Let's go.
[65:44.64]It's time to go.
[65:45.18]Let's see what these guys do.
[65:52.79]Try to keep them in frame.
[65:53.65]What do they do?
[66:00.87]What's their game plan?
[66:02.07]Are they gonna get off?
[66:06.69]Wait, this is important.
[66:11.20]Looks like they're getting ready to fight.
[66:19.58]Alright.
[66:20.66]Come on down.
[66:26.12]This is not safe for you to be up there anymore, man.
[66:28.03]Come on.
[66:30.31]Are you gonna come down here?
[66:34.09]Let's go!
[66:38.23]Stop just looking at me and let's go!
[66:43.40]Why are they doing this?
[66:50.24]I'm so curious, though.
[66:51.42]Like, I'm sorry it was taking a while, but I need to fucking know if they're gonna jump off there.
[66:58.21]Like, how far do we need to go before these guys actually follow me?
[67:07.23]Did they jump?
[67:07.81]I have no idea.
[67:12.57]Let's get up a little higher.
[67:17.68]Nope, it's still there.
[67:29.38]Okay.
[67:31.26]Well.
[67:34.07]What if I summon them?
[67:40.53]Wait, did he actually just kill this guy?
[67:44.07]What?
[67:44.33]Hold on, he threw a knife and killed him.
[67:47.90]Are you fucking kidding me?
[67:53.38]Wow, that was unbelievable.
[67:56.00]Look at the guy on the left.
[67:58.28]He's so fucking jacked up right now.
[68:02.10]Wow!
[68:04.90]That's a captain, guys.
[68:07.53]This is a fucking captain.
[68:16.92]This is unbelievable.
[68:18.00]They're gonna kill this captain.
[68:20.60]He's running away now.
[68:22.88]That's insanity.
[68:26.82]Wow.
[68:27.56]Okay.
[68:30.36]Wow!
[68:30.84]Oh, wow!
[68:34.74]Wow, guys!
[68:36.24]I can't believe it!
[68:37.38]Is that building on fire?
[68:43.97]Okay, well, bye guys.
[68:44.93]Thanks for helping.
[68:53.29]He's gonna throw a knife from all the way down there, isn't he?
[68:58.35]No.
[69:00.33]There he goes.
[69:14.32]No way.
[69:19.83]That's fucking incredible.
[69:21.69]There he goes again.
[69:25.28]He got another one.
[69:27.62]You guys don't... You guys think I'm distracted right now.
[69:29.98]You guys don't want to know how far this guy can throw a knife across the whole game.
[69:40.66]Here he goes.
[69:47.02]This guy is a fucking master assassin.
[69:50.80]Like, I'm embarrassed being near this guy because he's that good.
[69:59.18]What about people that he can't even see?
[70:00.56]What do you think?
[70:04.04]These guys... Oh, no.
[70:04.70]They're off the screen now.
[70:05.74]Oh, well.
[70:08.99]Okay.
[70:09.59]Well, we had our fun.
[70:10.79]They despawned.
[70:13.17]They were all the way back here, though.
[70:16.61]That was cool.
[70:18.33]Wow!
[70:22.18]Alright, let's go.
[70:23.06]Let's do the quest.
[70:24.52]How far away am I?
[70:27.94]I can just fast travel.
[70:28.78]I don't even need to fast travel.
[70:29.84]I can just jump.
[70:30.86]Yeah, at least Og... That whole thing was to go kill Og, right?
[70:38.87]Can I make a jump here?
[70:41.01]No.
[70:41.69]I'll just fast travel to the front of it.
[70:45.55]Because it's back there.
[70:52.61]That was really cool, though.
[70:58.01]Weird shit like that in games is interesting to watch every time.
[71:10.05]Up, up, up, up, up.
[71:14.60]On to the tower.
[71:18.78]That sucked.
[71:19.46]What do you mean?
[71:19.82]That was fucking cool.
[71:21.50]Her youth is her strength and her weakness.
[71:28.34]Mm-hmm Telling you come on I can like hang down here, right?
[71:32.32]I mean kind of You think some of these guys just be looking at me right now being like dude will you just go home the fucking front door See this is how they're training somebody in the chat asked how do they train these guys to do that like this and
[71:56.70]What you guys don't know is these guys are all hitting an orc.
[71:59.90]Across the whole game.
[72:02.70]That's their training regimen.
[72:09.94]Oh.
[72:12.52]Where did that guy come from?
[72:21.17]Let's start the domination.
[72:26.55]General Castamere has been captured by the Witch King's forces accompanying Idril to save her father.
[72:46.74]Cut scene.
[72:48.78]My father's being held in the Warchief's camp, but we were spotted before we could attempt a rescue.
[72:55.27]Yeah, we're going for probably six hours again tonight, guys.
[72:59.37]You want to go back now?
[73:01.71]Alone?
[73:03.25]Probably a solid five-plus hour stream tonight.
[73:07.35]If I wait till dawn, my father will be dead.
[73:09.49]I'm saying don't go.
[73:13.52]I'm saying don't go alone.
[73:23.29]Those eyes were facing different directions.
[73:26.82]You want, like, a funny, like, meme text face image?
[73:30.32]Go with the thing that he just said.
[73:32.64]And take that, and add... Like, you know that guy at the rave?
[73:35.92]Where he, like, has a huge realization in the rave, and has, like, the top text, like, oh, can you believe it, that?
[73:41.42]And then underneath, like, fucking cats have four paws, and his, like, face looks like fucking, like, wow!
[73:46.34]He was just doing one of those.
[73:50.90]And what do you believe?
[73:53.27]I wasn't given a good example.
[73:54.49]I'm just saying random words.
[73:58.27]Meme stream.
[74:00.63]Sneak into the Orc camp.
[74:01.38]That sounds easy enough.
[74:21.88]Stealth kill.
[74:29.56]Kill him.
[74:31.32]Nice.
[74:33.88]Excellent work.
[74:34.58]I just did everything and you came in and got the free kill.
[74:39.62]Rescue captured soldiers.
[74:41.88]Where is he going?
[74:43.32]What is he doing?
[74:50.79]Are you actually just doing that right now?
[74:53.29]Why would you do that?
[74:55.03]Give me the oppor- What are you doing?!
[75:00.16]Fine, fuck it.
[75:00.96]You wanna play this game?
[75:02.46]I can't even do it.
[75:02.94]Nevermind, just go.
[75:07.34]I understand escort missions, but when an escort mission turns into, I'm gonna do the mission while you sit there and watch and I'm gonna cause problems.
[75:13.67]What are they making over here?
[75:17.85]Are they cooking something?
[75:24.25]More soldiers.
[75:27.83]That could have been a disaster.
[75:29.85]Almost shot this guy in the head.
[75:30.97]It's okay.
[75:36.65]AI is better than the streamer.
[75:38.15]No, I was just watching what was going to happen.
[75:47.00]Yes, you are.
[75:48.48]Now go home and tell all your friends.
[75:53.36]Her AI is a full, like, four or five seconds behind her.
[76:03.62]Oh, there's a fucking rare there.
[76:06.36]Is there a way I can say, like, wait?
[76:09.59]Wait.
[76:11.11]No, not kill.
[76:12.01]Not kill.
[76:12.77]Don't kill.
[76:13.77]Wait.
[76:14.37]There's only one button.
[76:15.49]It's kill.
[76:17.11]There's no other button.
[76:21.72]Well, she did an alright job.
[76:22.88]You know what?
[76:24.79]We need stuff.
[76:28.07]Let's just cut people free.
[76:32.69]She's more than capable.
[76:33.91]I'm just going to go around and do this quest.
[76:35.83]I'm so nonchalant.
[76:41.13]I'll just elbow that guy right in the back of the head.
[76:45.33]Alright, let's get this gem.
[76:50.03]Kill Og.
[76:50.53]Og's not here.
[76:52.65]Hog is not even close to being where we are right now.
[76:57.23]He's somewhere else.
[76:57.79]Mm-hmm.
[77:00.69]Cut him free.
[77:03.09]Mm-hmm.
[77:22.33]I have Og's Dagger?
[77:25.45]What?
[77:30.33]Og's Dagger?
[77:31.64]How am I doing?
[77:34.18]I'm doing well.
[77:34.80]Thank you.
[77:35.48]How are you doing?
[77:36.12]Hopefully you're doing well.
[77:40.46]Wait, don't I have to... Don't I have to hit somebody that's on fire?
[77:50.55]It's not going to work.
[77:53.75]That's supposed to look like a poison darger.
[77:55.51]A poison darger!
[77:56.78]Whoa, I love those poison dargs.
[78:03.60]And there it is.
[78:05.35]Feet remaining.
[78:05.91]Camp guards.
[78:06.55]Wow.
[78:07.31]I don't have to do anything.
[78:09.81]You are just here, ready to go.
[78:11.59]One more guard.
[78:22.28]You're not going anywhere, General.
[78:53.90]Before a Reigns of Castamere joke.
[78:58.31]It was too easy to do that.
[79:03.79]What I should be saying is, why does this guy sound like he's talking through a voice changer?
[79:08.63]He's the only guy in the game that has a voice like this.
[79:17.52]That's just Troy Baker again, just with a pitch shifter on.
[79:31.28]What happened alright, well then go get him Quickly turn around spin the other way attack rat Playing a strategy game.
[79:48.59]This is a perfect fucking real-time strategy game.
[79:51.57]Oh
[79:57.73]They just do everything.
[79:58.53]I just have to watch.
[79:59.83]I'm the perspective of the guy up in the sky with the mouse.
[80:03.00]You know what I mean?
[80:08.70]Nice.
[80:09.54]Alright.
[80:09.74]Keep it up.
[80:10.08]Alright.
[80:12.66]I'll take the guy.
[80:13.26]I'm going to kill him at the same exact time.
[80:15.14]Ready?
[80:15.46]One.
[80:15.96]Two.
[80:17.77]Two.
[80:18.87]Three.
[80:19.83]Nice.
[80:24.45]This time you go for that one.
[80:26.11]You go for that one.
[80:31.35]I just blow it for him.
[80:33.29]I'm trying to, like, fuck it up for him.
[80:36.65]Defeat the bridge guards.
[80:44.34]Alright, ready?
[80:45.38]Let's try to get this together and... Look at that.
[80:53.12]That's teamwork there.
[80:55.36]What?
[80:55.90]I need my fucking companion.
[80:58.24]Now we get the whole Wizard of Oz.
[81:01.32]We've got Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion.
[81:07.82]We've got the whole movie here, guys.
[81:09.48]We're fine.
[81:09.92]We're ready to go.
[81:15.07]Mm-hmm.
[81:26.77]Everybody this way.
[81:28.89]So I can do this.
[81:29.57]Come on.
[81:34.51]Is it worth it?
[81:35.05]Hold on a second.
[81:38.17]I know this is not a top quality joke, but... Sometimes you have to just run with it.
[81:51.38]That's what we're going to run with.
[81:53.28]The Wizard of Ogg.
[82:00.20]No, that's not what I wanted.
[82:08.62]Fuck the ad.
[82:09.76]This is not what I wanted you to see.
[82:14.06]This fucking ad is ruining the whole stream.
[82:17.14]How long is this ad?
[82:39.57]Hey, look at that, what's this?
[82:43.45]Play it.
[82:45.79]What the fuck?
[82:46.79]The ad crashed my browser.
[82:49.75]It didn't even fucking work, whatever.
[82:52.29]Oh my God, fuck this.
[83:08.78]The general returns.
[83:09.86]Open the gates!
[83:16.40]Open the gates!
[83:18.84]General, the seeing's started.
[83:20.78]I can use it.
[83:21.56]The volunteer is safe where it is.
[83:24.86]I finally had like... I wanted like five seconds.
[83:27.99]Ten seconds tops.
[83:30.67]Whatever.
[83:32.07]Wonderful Wizard of Ogg.
[83:34.03]Oh well.
[83:35.75]We've been waiting for Gondor for weeks.
[83:39.45]No one has come.
[83:42.67]He has the ring.
[83:43.55]No, Shelob does.
[83:44.23]Can you really use the stone to defeat them?
[83:47.47]Yes.
[83:48.91]Then I will find where it's hidden.
[83:58.01]Mission complete.
[83:58.95]Until Dawn.
[84:00.55]Skill point gained.
[84:01.21]415 rebel coins.
[84:04.82]Taliyah level 14.
[84:09.34]The Palantir is here.
[84:11.88]The war is here.
[84:13.52]We must weaken Sauron's hold on this evil.
[84:20.90]Show me what you got!
[84:23.46]Alright, I swear!
[84:25.32]I brought some new recruits.
[84:27.59]Okay, here we go, guys.
[84:29.61]Ready?
[84:30.61]Is it here?
[84:31.25]Everybody, here we go!
[84:32.85]Alright, on the count of three.
[84:33.93]One...
[84:35.60]Two!
[84:36.90]Three!
[84:38.44]Which one of my guards?
[84:47.80]This one.
[84:49.38]That one.
[84:50.14]And this one.
[84:51.02]Alright, I tagged my men again.
[84:56.43]The three looking at you.
[84:57.69]Wait, I'll do it better.
[84:58.51]Hold on.
[85:02.31]Okay, here we go.
[85:02.97]One.
[85:05.03]Just wait until everyone is done moving.
[85:06.39]Alright, which one of my men?
[85:13.62]The bunt's not holding fucking swords.
[85:15.16]Whatever!
[85:16.38]It was a stupid shit thing that I... That's not fair, the guy says.
[85:36.88]whatever I'm gonna give up I'm gonna go see sheila okay why what rage montage why are you guys saying please stop everyone's like please stop it
[86:04.83]So... Where is this other quest?
[86:07.59]I think we have to go back to... We've got to go to Shelob, right?
[86:13.46]Let's do this one while we're in there.
[86:16.70]And fast travel to here.
[86:21.66]Do not stop.
[86:22.40]Well, I don't... You guys got... You're giving me mixed messages here.
[86:25.41]Let's... One second.
[86:31.21]One second.
[86:32.72]Let me first of all thank StyxRenegade for the five bucks.
[86:35.86]Can I get a jermaRat for jermaRat movies on stream?
[86:42.54]I'm not doing jermaRat movie.
[86:45.60]We already played rat movie last time.
[86:47.27]Except it was my dog.
[86:48.29]Because he's kind of a rat.
[86:49.75]He's like a dachshund mix.
[86:50.73]He could be a rat.
[86:51.39]There could be a rat in there.
[86:53.41]But thank you, Renegade.
[86:55.05]Of the Styx variety for the ten bucks total.
[86:58.76]Oh no, that was from the other day.
[86:59.82]But thanks for the five bucks.
[87:01.22]Lance, Gary Gray, Leferl, thank you guys for the bits.
[87:04.79]Thanks for three bucks.
[87:05.43]Jerma, are you going to watch the giant robot fight next week?
[87:10.11]When is there a giant robot fight?
[87:12.15]Like in real life, is it actually going to do that?
[87:14.05]That's weird.
[87:14.57]Well, probably.
[87:16.43]I'm sure I'll have a pretty good front row seat because if a giant robot fight is actually happening, you can pretty much be anywhere on Earth and open your window and get on your roof and see it.
[87:25.72]It's like an eclipse, right?
[87:26.84]Because you're talking about monsters that are potentially like thousands and thousands of feet tall.
[87:31.76]Get on your roof and look if they're happening.
[87:33.51]If it's happening in, like... Like, it could be happening in the middle of Europe, and I could stand and look and see it.
[87:41.23]Because they're, like, 20,000 feet tall.
[87:42.89]So I'll be able to see it wherever it is.
[87:46.23]So, anyways, thanks a lot, dude.
[87:48.98]Gary Gray, am I going to do a Shadow of War unboxing?
[87:51.02]No.
[87:52.50]Frap Spackle, thanks for the 20 bucks earlier.
[87:59.30]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say thank you for making me happy when times are poopy.
[88:02.10]P.S.
[88:02.48]Rat Movie 3, The Rat Rug.
[88:04.66]Possible.
[88:05.76]But thanks for the 20 bucks wrap.
[88:07.78]Hope you're enjoying yourselves.
[88:08.66]Hope you're enjoying yourself.
[88:11.38]I added an S there for no reason.
[88:13.36]Hope your night's going well.
[88:15.85]Hope it's not going poopy.
[88:19.19]Reptilian God, thanks for the $4.
[88:21.09]Today's my birthday.
[88:21.83]Here's some money.
[88:23.33]Well, shouldn't you be getting money on your birthday?
[88:26.15]Don't give me your birthday money, Reptilian.
[88:29.45]Or that might just be like an old money from like months ago.
[88:33.22]Maybe.
[88:33.98]But don't give me your birthday money.
[88:35.06]That's your birthday money.
[88:35.80]Go buy yourself a fucking cake.
[88:37.40]Happy birthday.
[88:40.13]Lysol Blake, thanks for the five bucks.
[88:43.41]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the five bucks.
[88:45.57]I'd recommend investing some of those unspent skill points into your comedy skill tree.
[88:50.62]That's it.
[88:50.90]You're out.
[88:51.62]You're banned.
[88:54.12]You don't come after my comedy skills.
[88:55.88]Because I know that they're top-notch.
[88:57.65]They're fucking top-notch.
[88:59.19]I don't need any more skill points, because I already maxed the tree out, like, two years ago.
[89:03.41]Okay?
[89:09.77]I maxed out my comedy skill tree.
[89:12.90]And, you know, maybe I forgot to put points into, like, basic motor skills.
[89:17.78]But it didn't matter.
[89:18.66]Like, I had the comedy tree, like, basic motor skills, and...
[89:23.93]Like reading, right?
[89:24.91]Those are the three trees that people have as human beings.
[89:27.71]You've got the tree number one is motor skills.
[89:30.56]That's like driving a car.
[89:32.00]That's like moving your arms, dancing, breathing.
[89:35.68]You've got the comedy tree, which is the middle skill tree.
[89:37.66]That includes stuff like social interactions, funny, making up jokes and shit like that.
[89:42.67]Maxed out that tree.
[89:43.63]The other tree is reading, right?
[89:45.69]The third tree is reading.
[89:46.53]That means reading books, reading signs.
[89:50.09]and being able to determine, like, how people are communicating with you.
[89:53.13]Those are your three trees as a human, and I didn't put any points in the other two, only in the comedy tree.
[89:58.68]Sorry.
[90:07.93]You want to have, like, a scientist come and, like, tell me, well, that's not true.
[90:10.53]But you're going to believe a scientist?
[90:15.48]You're gonna believe a guy just because he put points into a different tree?
[90:20.82]I was under the assumption that that didn't matter.
[90:22.38]I didn't disconnect the fucking controller.
[90:25.74]These are the guys that...
[90:47.05]Every time.
[90:47.76]That's all you have to do, guys.
[90:57.50]Where you gonna go?
[91:08.65]That guy's- he's burning.
[91:10.15]He's just running and burning.
[91:11.17]And the guy behind him is burning too.
[91:13.63]He's gonna kill this guy.
[91:14.69]He's gonna accidentally kill his friend.
[91:20.08]Is he on fire again?
[91:22.48]What?
[91:23.08]He's not getting it.
[91:28.26]Anyways.
[91:29.92]What I'm trying to say is just because somebody put points in like strength versus dexterity, that means that their character's not good?
[91:37.85]No?
[91:38.05]They can still complete the game.
[91:41.67]The game can still absolutely be completed.
[91:46.31]Now, some people put their points in shit that they shouldn't have put their points into, but that doesn't mean that they can't beat the game.
[91:52.30]Of life.
[91:57.24]I'm going to get rid of this guy, because why would I not?
[92:00.38]Let's just ram him into people.
[92:04.29]Hold on.
[92:04.87]Did I just WWF this guy?
[92:06.91]Yeah, I did.
[92:08.11]I'm running him into the pole.
[92:18.15]One more.
[92:20.69]And this should do it.
[92:24.65]Not quite.
[92:25.21]He's gonna retreat now.
[92:33.70]Who's the guy that I actually... That got away from me?
[92:38.64]Does he have a pair of scissors in his pocket?
[92:43.76]Why the hell would you do that?
[92:49.68]Let's go.
[92:51.92]Uh, how close am I to Shelob's lair?
[92:59.07]There's no fast travel to here, is there?
[93:00.59]Oh, yes, there is.
[93:01.31]Okay.
[93:09.43]Mmm, I'll do that later.
[93:10.83]Let's just get this out of the way.
[93:11.79]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[93:22.21]The final vision.
[93:25.12]Talion, the ring is lost, but I will have my answers.
[93:32.60]Put my points into height.
[93:35.16]How would I need to do that?
[93:37.75]Wait, what?
[93:40.91]Shelob!
[93:43.05]Minas Igon is on the verge of collapse.
[93:46.41]We need the Palantir.
[93:48.77]Did somebody correct me last stream saying that this wasn't Shelob, it was like Shiloh?
[93:53.07]The Palantir.
[93:54.31]Yeah.
[93:54.73]Somebody said it was Shiloh.
[93:55.83]Have I not given you sight over your enemies?
[93:58.82]That is what you seek, isn't it?
[94:05.90]Oh, I will grant you your vision.
[94:13.86]I feel like her dress is just being held up by one knot somewhere.
[94:23.68]And if that knot were to even remotely come undone, the whole dress comes off.
[94:28.27]You know what I mean?
[94:28.81]You know when you see an Oogie Boogie when they undid one little piece of his thread on his face and all of a sudden bugs crawled out of him?
[94:39.08]She has an elaborate knot somewhere where the towel drops and it's like, oh shit!
[94:49.86]I've been there before.
[94:56.86]There's Balrog!
[95:00.18]There he is!
[95:00.62]There's Balrog!
[95:03.06]Oh no, Bison.
[95:03.90]M. Bison.
[95:05.78]Both of them!
[95:06.46]Both of them have an eye patch!
[95:07.50]Who cares?
[95:11.08]She's a spider and not a bug.
[95:16.12]What are you talking about?
[95:21.42]A spider is a bug.
[95:25.23]And don't give me this bullshit that a spider is an arachnid.
[95:28.01]Because lobsters are bugs too.
[95:30.91]Crabs are bugs.
[95:32.79]No, those are crustaceans.
[95:33.77]They're bugs.
[95:38.98]Oh, it's an arachnid.
[95:40.68]It's a goddamn bug.
[95:46.54]Yes, they are.
[95:47.10]Yes, they are.
[95:47.88]Crustaceans are distant relatives to bugs.
[95:50.59]To, like, spiders and shit.
[95:53.37]You want to talk about, like, the scientist that, like, talks about all this shit?
[95:56.13]Like... Why do you have to do this to me all the time?
[95:59.90]This cord is fucked up.
[96:03.96]Cross stations are distantly related to arachnids and bugs and shit.
[96:10.14]I swear to God.
[96:10.58]I thought people knew that.
[96:13.50]Do I have to go to Wikipedia and pull up...
[96:30.57]Just type into Google, R Lobster's Bugs.
[96:34.05]And you'll get something from the Wall Street Journal.
[96:43.00]Well, I saved everybody, apparently.
[96:44.68]I saved that one guy.
[96:52.60]Oh, no.
[96:54.93]Shit.
[96:56.29]Balrog Bisonburger is having trouble crawling.
[97:00.02]What the fuck are you doing?
[97:01.34]You're causing me problems.
[97:03.82]Is that Sauron?
[97:16.37]Oh, here's the first big battle.
[97:18.45]Hold the courtyard until reinforcements arrive.
[97:24.71]Well, you just kind of came in in my face.
[97:33.63]You just, ah, there's nothing I can say now.
[97:36.26]It's over.
[97:37.42]I've lost all control at this point.
[97:47.99]Wording, Jeremy!
[97:50.11]Thanks.
[97:55.53]I'm not going to do Elven Rage.
[97:56.83]I want to get control of that serpent.
[98:01.93]Dragon serpent.
[98:08.99]I'm going to get control of that dragon.
[98:11.99]Call in my reinforcements.
[98:15.91]Call up my friends.
[98:18.91]Right into the chest.
[98:21.91]Good.
[98:23.58]Technically, lobsters are cockroaches.
[98:25.10]Thank you.
[98:28.28]Appreciate it.
[98:29.10]Appreciate the support.
[98:29.94]Alright, what else we got here?
[98:34.46]Instantly mount a broken Grog or Drake.
[98:36.21]Alright, what is this one?
[98:37.81]Shadow mount unbroken Karagors.
[98:39.93]That's kind of awesome.
[98:44.75]You can summon a Drake.
[98:47.81]Damn.
[98:48.09]I think we should probably get another combat skill, though.
[98:54.54]I mean, yeah.
[98:55.98]Why the hell would I not have that?
[98:58.72]Yes, they are.
[98:59.18]Yes, they are.
[99:02.03]I mean, like, come on, guys.
[99:05.11]You don't think I've done a little bit of research?
[99:07.69]I've done at least one research.
[99:13.51]I've been to Harvard.
[99:16.79]Like, I've been... I went to Harvard.
[99:23.21]No, I mean, for lunch one time.
[99:26.41]I went to Harvard, though.
[99:27.71]Like... I don't think I need to explain that any more than I have to.
[99:34.31]Alright, there's the dragon.
[99:46.26]Break him.
[99:48.42]Break him!
[99:51.02]Break him!
[99:52.42]Why is he down here?
[99:54.84]Just begin the Elven Rage and just fuck him up.
[99:58.40]Is he broken?
[100:01.87]Holy shit, he's almost dead.
[100:03.69]Don't kill him.
[100:04.91]I just wanted to break him.
[100:08.11]Oh my lord.
[100:08.77]Don't die.
[100:14.92]No, the drake.
[100:15.70]Not the one random shithead.
[100:17.22]The drake.
[100:18.34]The drake.
[100:20.40]Oh no.
[100:21.32]Come on.
[100:22.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[100:23.94]Just shadow drake him.
[100:25.10]How do I do that?
[100:25.62]How do I shadow...
[100:48.40]I'm just like, over 7.
[100:50.90]He's not broken?
[100:51.76]I thought he was.
[100:52.58]What a broken kill.
[100:53.54]22 epic.
[100:54.86]Time to string together some combos.
[101:16.98]Come on, man-filth.
[101:19.52]To the legs.
[101:27.82]Oh, you fucked it up.
[101:28.56]I thought that was a guy on my team.
[101:30.77]Immune to execution.
[101:34.03]Well, I have to stab him in the back then.
[101:39.75]Why would I climb over this guy?
[101:41.87]There's no reason for me to climb over the back of him into the front.
[101:50.37]Oh, these are berserkers.
[101:53.57]Stun, you idiots.
[101:57.76]Get him.
[102:01.48]Get that guy.
[102:06.22]Beat the assault leader.
[102:08.80]I will.
[102:09.92]Just trying to do a little bit of stuff.
[102:12.08]What about arrows?
[102:16.52]I don't even have any arrows.
[102:17.84]Let's go get some arrows.
[102:26.45]He does get hurt by arrows, doesn't he?
[102:29.98]Go!
[102:31.32]Get him off me!
[102:32.60]That was very delayed.
[102:51.91]Oh, come on.
[102:53.01]Oh, please.
[102:54.49]Please!
[102:56.23]That was perfect.
[102:56.89]That was gonna be perfect.
[103:03.56]Bugs are gross things I don't like.
[103:05.04]You know, I don't hate bugs.
[103:07.68]I actually used to, um... I used to love caterpillars when I was a little kid.
[103:18.19]If I saw a caterpillar on the side of the road or on the sidewalk or something, oh, I loved it.
[103:22.77]Have you been drinking?
[103:28.50]What the fuck are you doing?
[103:31.04]Just throwing guys at me now.
[103:32.26]Alright, let's get him.
[103:40.50]But as an adult, caterpillars freak me out.
[103:44.71]Because I just think what's inside them.
[103:47.67]It's just goo.
[103:48.83]That's all it is.
[103:49.29]It's just sludge inside their bodies.
[103:50.71]Come on, camera.
[103:57.61]I'm in fucking trouble.
[103:59.24]I'm gonna watch out.
[103:59.86]I'm gonna kill this guy with a headshot.
[104:04.14]That seems like the right thing to do.
[104:11.16]Who's bleeding?
[104:12.58]Who's bleeding?
[104:13.26]Somebody's bleeding?
[104:19.77]Hold on, this guy's bleeding.
[104:21.07]Oh shit, that's like one of my friends.
[104:27.57]That's the only guy left.
[104:28.61]He's just throwing shit.
[104:35.33]Alright, can he die?
[104:36.17]Oh my lord.
[104:37.99]Yeah, I wanted to grab that guy twice.
[104:41.05]That's who I wanted to grab, Mordor.
[104:43.80]I wanted to grab that guy twice, is what I wanted to do.
[104:47.36]What the fuck?
[104:59.52]Will you fucking just die?
[105:02.14]Finally, Jesus.
[105:11.11]Try to grab him when he's dazed.
[105:12.65]Go under him.
[105:14.13]No.
[105:15.41]Grab that same guy you grabbed.
[105:17.57]Run through eight people to do it.
[105:21.25]So they take the city.
[105:40.30]You betrayed us.
[105:42.90]I did this for you, Ytral.
[105:45.10]For your survival.
[105:47.38]The Palantir means nothing.
[105:49.70]I would give all of Gondor to save you.
[105:51.96]What have I done?
[105:52.46]His voice changed again.
[105:53.48]Of our honor.
[105:57.58]There is no honor in death.
[106:01.23]Uh-oh.
[106:03.89]Castamere!
[106:07.83]It is shocking that I have not made a Game of Thrones joke.
[106:11.64]It's shocking to me.
[106:13.12]You guys are right.
[106:13.66]When you're right, you're right.
[106:15.10]How have I not done that?
[106:16.50]Why did I not start doing the Reigns of Castamere?
[106:19.71]Now is the time to do it.
[106:28.89]The house, the family's house gets destroyed.
[106:31.27]The whole house Castamere gets killed and ruined.
[106:34.85]This is why they did this.
[106:39.57]I should have the reigns of Castamere queued up, ready to go.
[106:44.70]But I don't.
[106:45.94]Yeah, I do.
[107:14.24]And who are you?
[107:16.92]Proud Lord said that I... I gotta get a fucking... These ads are fucking horrible, man.
[107:23.11]I must bow so low.
[107:39.79]Okay, wait a minute.
[107:42.76]We're done.
[107:44.52]I thought it was still playing.
[107:49.72]Don't do it!
[108:12.59]No.
[108:14.70]Gods, I was funny then.
[109:04.19]I can't turn it off.
[109:04.91]I have to alt tab to turn it off.
[109:06.03]I'm sorry.
[109:07.25]I'm sorry.
[109:07.83]I'm really sorry.
[109:08.65]I gotta turn this off, but I'm in like a boss fight.
[109:13.72]I'm so fucking sorry.
[109:17.46]That was not what was supposed to happen.
[109:18.64]That was absolutely not what was gonna happen.
[109:23.04]Ah, something's auto-playing.
[109:30.68]This is not what I wanted.
[109:31.56]This is absolutely not the fucking thing I wanted to do.
[109:33.82]And something's gonna auto-play after this.
[109:47.12]I just dodged into that.
[109:48.38]I can't pay attention to it.
[109:51.38]He's broken.
[109:51.88]Get banished, motherfucker.
[109:53.68]This really is a two-year-old joke.
[109:55.96]Shut up.
[110:22.06]Yeah, we're pulling out like two-year-old jokes right now.
[110:26.29]What's going on?
[110:26.69]Oh.
[110:26.75]What the fuck?
[110:28.25]Okay, hold on.
[110:30.59]Like, I come back for a bite.
[110:32.49]Remind me never to fucking do that again.
[110:44.26]I can't summon my buddies?
[110:46.32]Oh, well.
[110:50.84]Let's get this guy over here.
[110:52.70]Remind me never to do... I'm done with that.
[110:57.86]I'm not gonna play music again.
[110:59.30]This is cool, and I fucked it all up.
[111:04.10]He's broken.
[111:17.09]Can't- the music is still loud?
[111:18.79]No, this music's off.
[111:20.33]Alright, I'm gonna banish that dude.
[111:28.48]Wherever he may be, alright?
[111:29.84]Ooh!
[111:32.06]Got ya!
[111:35.50]Whoa!
[111:45.99]At least the bosses are actually interesting.
[111:48.41]Before, the last one, I feel like they were just tacked on.
[111:51.23]This is barely even a boss.
[111:52.59]See you later.
[112:03.82]Oh no, they're not playing any more music.
[112:08.26]Every time I start playing music in my streams, the whole stream goes to shit.
[112:12.82]The entire thing.
[112:22.13]And that's, here it is.
[112:23.23]See ya.
[112:29.27]I win.
[112:34.67]But that's what makes it funny.
[112:36.17]Pull my soul out again.
[113:03.55]Dude, do I become a bad guy or something?
[113:09.67]What?
[113:12.67]Where did you come from?
[113:15.85]She jumped off a trampoline into frame.
[113:18.27]Am I playing as a new character now?
[113:40.48]Oh, the bubble.
[113:41.36]We can't get through the bubble.
[113:47.60]You will not claim him today.
[113:50.24]Because I... I was gonna say, because I will.
[114:02.72]They kind of turned around there, just like, well, shit.
[114:12.35]What does the magic eight ball say?
[114:14.85]Will Talion go on a date with me today?
[114:19.79]Maybe.
[114:22.00]Oh, that's better than no.
[114:31.24]Oh, Shelob's going to resurrect me.
[114:32.54]Cool.
[114:38.48]Did she just bring him back?
[114:45.27]Wait, is Sauron talking to Sauron?
[114:48.96]This is past Sauron talking to current Sauron.
[114:55.18]This is some Rick and Morty shit.
[114:59.59]What galaxy is that Rick from?
[115:11.39]Bring me Celebrimbor's ring.
[115:16.52]And what of She-Ra, Synth, and Azul?
[115:23.86]All of them.
[115:27.45]Rick and Morty having a little funny show.
[115:29.73]And the, the, the...
[115:40.46]The nitwit king.
[115:41.38]Yeah, which one of the King Mortys is the one we need to do?
[115:53.41]I like... Rick and Morty is a funny show.
[115:56.67]I'm not going to pretend like I'm a scientist to think it's funny.
[116:08.92]You brought me back.
[116:10.67]Boy.
[116:10.85]Szechuan sauce.
[116:11.81]We're doing this, this whole mission tonight is to get the Szechuan sauce.
[116:39.89]Then I have failed.
[116:42.25]What if you keep fighting?
[116:44.25]He wields the light of Galadriel.
[116:47.51]He can recover the ring.
[116:49.48]Your rings are the cause of all this, Elton.
[116:51.44]So they can hear him.
[116:53.84]He's surprised by this.
[116:55.76]I see him.
[116:58.26]Who are you?
[117:01.24]I'm the blade of Galadriel.
[117:03.32]This is a made-up character.
[117:04.32]Galadriel work with assassins.
[117:06.91]Great threats make for unlikely alliances.
[117:09.42]You know this better than most.
[117:11.84]Now tell me more about this ring.
[117:15.40]We crafted it to defeat Sauron.
[117:16.77]But it was lost to the gray spider, Shalob.
[117:24.14]What did I just say?
[117:24.78]Everyone's like, oh, wow, why?
[117:26.43]What the hell are you talking about?
[117:27.29]You shitty joke.
[117:28.17]That was the worst thing I've ever said.
[117:33.61]What did I do?
[117:35.97]The Szechuan sauce?
[117:38.63]Yeah, but I was mentioning that, like, fucking ironically.
[117:40.89]I'm not, like, actually saying that.
[117:44.94]I burped up a reference to, like, make fun of the reference.
[117:49.16]I wasn't actually making the reference.
[117:52.50]Come on, guys.
[117:53.02]Remember when I did that?
[117:54.39]It was taunting me.
[117:55.25]It showed it on screen.
[117:58.53]So now we're going to go attack Shelob, right?
[118:07.37]Okay.
[118:10.65]Well, I was going to do that.
[118:12.42]Don't show me up on my own stream.
[118:17.10]There's one orc sitting there.
[118:20.71]This entire camp.
[118:21.75]Oh boy.
[118:22.19]Oh, lots of them.
[118:22.87]I think that was just... No, we're not supposed to attack those.
[118:26.41]Holy.
[118:26.71]Okay.
[118:27.39]This is just a scripted event.
[118:28.39]So they're coming to get the ring.
[118:29.43]We're coming to get the ring too.
[118:51.64]Everybody.
[118:52.10]You know, there's something about Mary.
[118:53.28]This is the end of that movie.
[118:57.55]See?
[119:03.93]She wants Mary.
[119:04.81]I want Mary.
[119:06.46]Celebrimbo wants Mary.
[119:13.30]Why are we walking over here?
[119:15.18]What are you...
[119:17.58]Like, guys, you can enjoy a television show without, like, making it your identity.
[119:40.90]Like, I live by the Game of Thrones.
[119:43.74]I love Game of Thrones.
[119:48.51]But I don't put like a Daenerys wig on every day.
[119:54.72]I mean, maybe I've done it once or twice.
[119:57.14]Just in the privacy of my own home.
[120:04.20]There she is again, on her trampoline.
[120:22.01]Alright, but... Is Shelob dead?
[120:29.30]I'm telling you, that fucking... Look at that dress, man.
[120:31.88]That's not... We're gonna have to give it a safety pin.
[120:52.80]She's giving the ring.
[121:01.09]That's okay.
[121:04.87]You can have it.
[121:07.43]The whole beginning of the game is meaningless now.
[121:16.20]The first, like, three or four hours of the game didn't need to happen.
[121:19.60]Just take that.
[121:20.30]Build your army.
[121:22.46]Play the fucking mobile game.
[121:24.05]I'm out.
[121:30.19]Open up some crates.
[121:32.97]Buy some... Buy some purple or pink magic crystals.
[121:40.89]To speed up your building time.
[121:42.35]It's only gonna cost you, like, 900 bucks.
[121:48.96]I thought that was her coming back.
[121:51.32]Oh, by the way, I have new clothes on.
[121:55.53]You must destroy this ring.
[121:57.29]It belongs to us.
[121:59.75]We want shit.
[122:01.01]We need shit.
[122:02.33]This ring is different.
[122:04.83]It's different.
[122:05.41]What if he had the hot fucking golem voice right now?
[122:11.24]I strike down men corrupted by these rings.
[122:14.94]Do not become one of them.
[122:18.20]When the time comes, I will do what is needed.
[122:25.12]Perhaps.
[122:27.00]Get as far from here as you can.
[122:29.74]The ringwraiths will return.
[122:31.12]They always do.
[122:33.84]You just put the ring on, you become Gollum.
[122:35.53]We will do what is needed, Master.
[122:44.49]Oh, Bright Master!
[122:51.38]Oh!
[122:51.54]We need shit!
[122:53.36]The ring's too big.
[123:01.71]Yeah, I need to get it, like, fitted for my hand.
[123:09.31]You can't just grab a ring.
[123:10.39]It's not a universal.
[123:11.29]Some people have skinny fingers.
[123:12.47]Some people have fat fingers.
[123:14.27]That would just slip off.
[123:15.05]If it was on some huge fucking demon lord's hands, you'd have to keep that in your pocket.
[123:24.90]Dobby is an elf!
[123:27.62]They need to do a crossover with... They put Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in the same universe.
[123:32.62]So I can do, like, Expelliarmus.
[123:34.31]And I can wield... Uh... Galad... Glam... Uh... Glambring.
[123:41.01]They are the same universe.
[123:41.89]No, they're not.
[123:51.02]J- J.K.
[123:52.11]Rowling and J.R.
[123:53.11]To- Actually, no, it's the same person.
[123:54.89]It's- Remember every story is the same story?
[123:56.45]Remember?
[123:57.87]J.R.R.
[123:58.79]Tolkien.
[124:00.27]J- J.K.
[124:02.49]J.R.R.
[124:04.39]Rowling.
[124:05.47]J.K.
[124:05.99]Tolkien.
[124:06.51]It's like the J.K.
[124:07.57]Cow- R.R.
[124:08.31]You know, it don't matter.
[124:09.09]It's the same fucking thing.
[124:09.89]George R.R.
[124:10.69]Martin.
[124:11.75]J.R.
[124:12.43]Tolkien.
[124:12.91]J.K.
[124:13.54]Tolkien.
[124:14.20]R.R.
[124:14.36]Martin.
[124:15.86]Think about it.
[124:18.18]Get woke.
[124:45.35]Alright, I get domination though.
[124:47.43]Why do you do this to us?
[124:50.42]I'm just having fun.
[124:51.12]We're just having fun here.
[124:58.82]The lighting looks strange.
[124:59.88]Use the new ring to build your army by dominating orcs.
[125:03.10]Hold RT to enter stealth and press B to stealth dominate your target.
[125:07.11]When not in stealth, hold B to dominate an orc.
[125:11.01]All drain abilities now dominate the target as does interrogating a worm.
[125:14.98]It only took eight hours to get here because I can't be trusted with open world video games.
[125:20.64]George R.R.
[125:20.92]Rolkeen.
[125:21.14]Alright, here's my first soldier.
[125:37.22]Remember this guy.
[125:45.66]I call you... Faceplant.
[125:50.40]For obvious reasons.
[125:52.28]Somebody slapped this guy.
[125:54.70]I came over to this dude and somebody slapped him in the face.
[125:57.91]He just got told off by somebody.
[126:02.58]Oh, wait, that's my hand.
[126:03.38]I just... Wait, hold on.
[126:04.76]I just burnt him.
[126:05.56]Okay, that was my hand.
[126:06.92]That's me.
[126:13.13]That must hurt.
[126:19.05]Goldfish memory.
[126:19.93]Well, come on.
[126:20.69]It burns inside their brain, not their face.
[126:22.81]That wasn't in the last game.
[126:28.36]That wasn't in the last game.
[126:29.26]It didn't leave a mark.
[126:37.90]So do you actually hold on to all these people?
[126:42.02]If that's the case, this is going to be really cool.
[126:45.18]But I can see how it can get tedious if you have to dominate hundreds of people over the next ten hours of gameplay.
[126:53.46]Yes, it was.
[126:54.00]No, it wasn't.
[126:56.00]I don't believe it.
[126:58.24]I don't have to believe it.
[127:00.88]Remember, when you have an opinion...
[127:04.86]based off of complete and total and untruth.
[127:10.17]Your opinion's all that matters.
[127:12.45]Even if it doesn't.
[127:13.37]Even if what you're saying is not even real.
[127:16.75]My opinion is what matters.
[127:18.29]And in my opinion, it wasn't in that game. ...
[127:40.39]What?
[127:40.55]What's up to me?
[127:43.57]What did I do?
[127:44.35]I didn't know that.
[127:48.54]I was trying to jump on the fucking plank that was sticking out.
[127:51.60]I wasn't trying to jump off.
[127:54.54]If possible, we should remain undetected.
[127:55.58]If possible.
[128:06.53]That's not a matter-of-fact statement.
[128:08.29]That was his opinion.
[128:11.54]Celebrimbor just gave me his opinion of what I should do.
[128:14.36]That wasn't based in fact.
[128:17.00]And as we all know, you have to live in reality.
[128:19.56]Factual information.
[128:20.58]He didn't give me a fact, he gave me an opinion.
[128:22.63]That's exactly what we were just talking about.
[128:24.31]The servants of the Dark Lord become ours.
[128:36.79]I just lost the mission based on Celebrimbor's opinion.
[128:41.68]It's the world we're living in.
[128:42.40]What was that noise?
[128:43.88]Oh, god damn it.
[128:47.84]Already our army consumes that of the Dark Lord.
[129:09.42]Servants of the Short Lord.
[129:11.19]Come on.
[129:16.87]The Ring will give us an army, in my opinion.
[129:22.13]What if they had to actually say that?
[129:26.20]Taliad.
[129:27.42]The Ring of Power will give us an army, I think.
[129:30.00]In my honest opinion, you need the Ring of Power.
[129:44.89]As strong as these warriors are, they cannot resist my ring.
[129:49.32]At least that's what I think, based on my previous experiences, in my opinion.
[129:53.86]Oh, I almost blew it.
[130:06.85]Commanding, dominated orcs will not attack their former allies until you press down to activate them.
[130:12.84]If you enter combat, any nearby dominated orcs will activate automatically.
[130:17.98]Alright.
[130:18.70]Test them out.
[130:23.06]Defeat or dominate the orcs in training.
[130:28.03]Well, they seem... Like they very much have a sense of urgency there.
[130:33.35]Let's just dominate a bunch of people.
[130:36.53]Let's just sit here and dominate.
[130:43.32]It's all about the domination.
[130:49.58]Can I just walk around and stealth dominate someone?
[130:53.62]Oh whatever, fuck it, let's just kill him.
[131:03.33]Taliyah!
[131:09.12]The guy that I was just swinging at.
[131:10.62]Oh, the Bright Mask stuff.
[131:11.52]That was fucking cool.
[131:14.68]I've never seen that move before.
[131:16.74]We need more warriors.
[131:32.11]Halt B to be... By the way, Talion, if you hold down left bumper and hold B, you say you would like to be dominated.
[131:41.82]And then an orc will come up to you and give you a nice slap in the face.
[131:46.72]Or I could do it.
[131:47.36]You know, I'm into that shit.
[131:51.61]Okay, commanders.
[131:53.59]He's got a legendary bow?
[132:01.37]Ooh, I did.
[132:03.79]I did get that ball.
[132:10.63]Might as well.
[132:15.50]Okay, let's look at the weapons, because I have a couple new ones.
[132:18.62]Useless.
[132:23.24]Damn.
[132:24.88]That's much better.
[132:30.83]Quick throw applies poison.
[132:33.35]That's good, because I need to poison people sometimes randomly.
[132:38.84]Still nothing better than this random fucking... epic bow that I have.
[132:50.87]You're telling me I haven't killed a captain with a ranged weapon yet?
[132:54.77]How?
[132:55.39]I shoot the bow all the time at them.
[132:57.77]I guess.
[133:00.52]I'm gonna keep the legendary stuff.
[133:01.82]I'm not deleting any legendary stuff.
[133:06.33]Because they're part of sets and shit.
[133:08.87]I don't want to lose them.
[133:11.05]And I have the one ring.
[133:12.27]I just got the bow ten seconds ago.
[133:16.23]I gotta pee.
[133:35.87]I'm gonna pee.
[133:40.30]Give me one second.
[133:40.82]I'm gonna pee.
[133:44.16]The plus one ring.
[133:47.16]I'll be right back.
[133:48.76]Don't go anywhere.
[133:49.52]Your regularly scheduled program will continue in a minute.
[134:11.58]Wait, what?
[137:21.92]Oh, Bridemaster, we want some coffee.
[137:25.18]We want some Cheetos.
[137:29.18]But we also want some chicken.
[137:33.06]Yes, nasty chicken.
[137:37.36]Okay.
[137:39.00]Let's go.
[137:49.56]Strange music draws you the forces of the new men it is time to answer its call Reward plus six six six six six eight eight eight eight.
[138:01.33]Let's do it.
[138:02.05]Hello There's an alligator in the swamp run

[138:10.31]You fucking run from a fight, coward!
[138:20.55]Oh boy.
[138:23.79]Follow the trail into the forest of the Carmen.
[138:26.65]Uh, future bound... Hold on.
[138:30.48]We have a lot of money.
[138:31.60]I should probably keep up on money.
[138:33.08]Keep track of this.
[138:34.80]Future bound TV.
[138:37.68]Maybe a hundred bucks.
[138:40.47]Thank you, Future Bound TV.
[138:45.07]I'm not sure if you're a television channel.
[138:48.19]You got that TV budget.
[138:52.28]Thank you, Future.
[138:53.88]Whoever you are, there's no message.
[138:54.98]It just says cheer 10,000.
[138:55.88]That's it.
[139:01.58]Thank you so much.
[139:05.66]People, you guys, some of you guys have been dropping, like, fucking $100.
[139:07.84]50 bucks, 100 bucks, a lot lately.
[139:13.23]It's a lot of money to give somebody.
[139:18.87]What's wrong with me?
[139:20.33]End me?
[139:21.55]Who's, am I saying this?
[139:29.86]What's going on?
[139:30.72]Oh, I thought that was me saying that.
[139:33.82]They added a poison swamp in the game.
[139:36.66]Are you kidding me?
[139:37.28]Don't even tell me that fucking... Did FromSoftware make this?
[139:42.97]I will in a second.
[139:47.63]Hold on.
[139:48.89]But yeah, future.
[139:50.49]Huge thanks.
[139:51.15]Thank you for the hundred bucks.
[139:55.25]I'll use it.
[139:55.91]I will use it somewhere good.
[139:59.89]Don't worry.
[140:01.65]Oh my god, what is that?
[140:03.13]Okay, I...
[140:05.60]If anybody is squeamish... I don't know what this is.
[140:09.76]I don't know why this is here.
[140:11.36]This is... I'm gonna make a warning here.
[140:13.34]This is a fucking huge warning.
[140:14.74]This has been here for, like, a day.
[140:15.76]I don't know what this is.
[140:17.84]No, this is from, like... It has to be from earlier.
[140:20.15]Why did I do this?
[140:20.75]Why did I spit this out?
[140:22.43]I must have, like, not liked this piece of chicken.
[140:24.17]I just ate dinner down here, like, a couple hours ago, right?
[140:28.97]And... I'm gonna warn you.
[140:31.23]What you're about to see, if you're squeamish...
[140:34.76]Be prepared because it's not pretty.
[140:37.70]I will tell you when it's over.
[140:40.79]But for now, why did I do this?
[140:48.49]This is like a glass of coffee or something.
[140:51.29]And I spit chicken into it.
[140:53.50]Okay.
[140:57.08]There you go.
[140:57.60]Now we are done with the gross thing.
[141:02.07]I don't know what that, why is that there?
[141:03.65]Now I need to throw that away now.
[141:06.80]You, I almost drank it.
[141:08.16]I like picked it up to look at it and I was like, oh, nope.
[141:13.64]My coffee was in there.
[141:14.56]No, this, I don't even know what this is.
[141:15.84]This cup is from like yesterday.
[141:17.22]You know, I got it.
[141:18.02]Here's what happened.
[141:19.56]I ate down here and like, I think I bit into a piece of chicken.
[141:23.32]Yeah, I remember.
[141:23.80]I bit into like a gross piece of chicken because chicken is weird.
[141:26.46]Sometimes you get like one out of every 10.
[141:29.97]bites like mouthfuls of chicken is gross and has like fat and like shitty like weird crunchy bone smelliness to it you don't like and you have to spit it out you guys know what I'm talking about that like fatty cartilage kind of texture that chicken has one out of ten so I just went oh and I spit it into there that's real alright let's go yeah some of you guys get it
[141:58.95]But anyways, let's move on.
[142:00.65]Thank you Reaper for the five bucks.
[142:01.99]All hail Jerma the short lord.
[142:03.43]That's fine.
[142:05.58]I'm not the tallest man.
[142:07.50]Thank you Darkstar for the bits.
[142:09.76]I feel like this game is melting your brain.
[142:11.38]You should take a break before you start some cult around all of us being J.R.R.R.
[142:16.64]Martin.
[142:18.24]No, I'm just like, I'm just having fun, man.
[142:20.63]Just chilling.
[142:24.91]Spit out some chicken, drink some coffee.
[142:27.75]Thank you to Guy Bandicoot.
[142:34.38]Gas Bandicoot.
[142:36.10]The guy with the gassy bandicoot.
[142:37.52]Thanks for five bucks.
[142:41.74]You did some fan art and I have to blame Twitch chat for it.
[142:45.56]Let's take a look.
[142:48.80]Let's see.
[142:51.66]Oh, it's just a jermaRat.
[142:53.22]That's pretty sick.
[142:54.28]That's a pretty sick Jerma.
[142:55.78]That doesn't make me angry.
[142:57.78]I don't have to blame chat.
[142:59.94]Brats are fucking awesome, especially even if it says I'm tiny.
[143:02.34]It's alright.
[143:07.46]Thanks, though.
[143:08.14]I appreciate it.
[143:09.76]That's by Nick.
[143:10.96]Thank you, Nick.
[143:14.36]Let's catch up one more thing here.
[143:19.55]Thank you, Sticks, for the five bucks.
[143:20.69]Say get woke as loud as I can.
[143:22.37]No.
[143:24.14]Cool cat, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[143:26.30]Can I hear a Jar Jar Binks impression?
[143:30.07]Oh, I probably can do one.
[143:31.57]Maybe, maybe eventually here.
[143:35.97]But thanks a lot, guys.
[143:37.81]You guys rock.
[143:40.93]Oh, no.
[143:41.89]Yeah, I could do it.
[143:47.10]I probably could if I tried.
[143:53.07]Probably.
[143:54.49]You want me to do the Sith Lord?
[143:55.83]The Sith Lord?
[143:56.45]Let's get back in the game.
[143:58.23]Am I cutting him loose?
[144:02.97]Darth Jar Jar.
[144:03.36]Yep.
[144:03.62]That was a big theory for a while.
[144:22.48]As you can see here, watch how Jar Jar Binks jumps and doesn't flip and lands on his feet perfectly.
[144:30.25]He wouldn't be able to do that if he wasn't a master Jedi.
[144:33.91]Look at how high he jumps here.
[144:35.89]I didn't want to do that to him.
[144:37.51]I take it this is the work of Khan.
[144:39.99]This is the forest of Ghana.
[144:41.15]You act like I didn't watch that whole video like four times.
[144:43.69]What happened to my guide?
[144:48.84]This forest is possessed by death as much as life.
[144:52.18]Oh, wow.
[144:53.46]So I leveled up my ability.
[144:56.10]Instead of three shitty fucking storm wind guards, I get orcs now.
[145:03.37]Follow the trail.
[145:09.11]There's a dead guy.
[145:12.39]Dead guy.
[145:12.87]I thought that was all golems.
[145:14.83]Look at these human orcs.
[145:20.51]Oh, god damn it, and... Come on, you're trying to tell me I'm not gonna do this?
[145:29.25]Raphael, Leonardo... And... And fucking Michelangelo, and I'm Don- No, I'm Leonardo.
[145:38.24]I got it, yeah, of course.
[145:39.78]Sorry, where could I go so wrong?
[145:41.22]I'm Leonardo.
[145:42.74]That's Donatello on the left.
[145:44.62]That's Raphael on the back.
[145:46.16]And that's Michelangelo on the right.
[145:52.57]No, I promised you no music.
[145:58.24]I promised you no music.
[145:59.84]No music.
[146:01.58]How many more foursome jokes are we going to make this fucking stream?
[146:04.18]I don't know.
[146:05.94]Hopefully not many more.
[146:10.64]And look, here's the lost fifth Ninja Turtle.
[146:13.20]AR5000, whatever his name is.
[146:19.31]The right man in the wrong possibility has all the right.
[146:38.13]systems.
[146:38.97]The right difference in all the men at the right time.
[146:42.59]Over there.
[147:03.19]Poison swamp.
[147:04.39]Poison swamp.
[147:05.35]Watch out for the Golem family.
[147:06.77]Watch out for Golem's Thanksgiving dinner.
[147:08.49]No, not you.
[147:12.31]What do you know?
[147:15.64]Not much.
[147:19.24]No.
[147:21.42]You already are on my team.
[147:22.70]Now he's double.
[147:23.66]I just gave him another print.
[147:28.19]Where is he going?
[147:28.91]No, no.
[147:29.59]He's going to go fight the Karagor.
[147:32.84]Well, is it... Which one of the Ninja Turtles is dead in canon?
[147:36.30]Because it's this guy.
[147:37.18]This is the one that it's about to be.
[147:44.83]No!
[147:45.27]This guy!
[147:46.59]Why are you... Oh my god!
[147:51.49]Do you... Ser... No!
[147:53.85]Donatella, wait!
[147:55.82]Wait a second!
[148:00.82]Alright, Donatello is the one that's dead in the canon.
[148:04.29]Alright, Donatello is dead.
[148:12.55]Yeah, they killed a Ninja Turtle like four years ago.
[148:14.91]You guys don't remember that?
[148:16.09]It's alright, we'll get another Donatello.
[148:27.70]In the other universe.
[148:28.96]Universe.
[148:30.76]Uh-oh.
[148:32.36]The ground itself.
[148:35.24]It's the trees.
[148:36.70]Okay, let's go.
[148:44.17]Investigate the great tree.
[148:45.61]I am in it.
[148:50.44]Except I'm a woman.
[148:54.42]Whoops.
[148:57.71]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[148:59.64]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[149:01.54]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[149:03.46]Heroes in a half shell.
[149:04.62]To the power.
[149:06.78]Leonardo Derry is discovered in glue.
[149:11.48]He's the leader.
[149:13.72]And he wears lots of blue.
[149:15.66]Calling out old fucking video memes from 2002.
[149:19.70]Do you grow?
[149:22.92]Do you wither?
[149:24.78]No.
[149:25.08]No, no.
[149:29.41]A lifeless beast are you, but no.
[149:34.61]For you, die and die.
[149:38.09]Die, die, die.
[149:39.97]Deathless, but deathless.
[149:44.40]A flesh-haunted thing.
[149:49.20]Tell her all we cannot defeat her.
[149:52.48]What would you suggest I do?
[149:55.00]Throw down your sword and kneel.
[149:57.91]Who's the guy with the mask, the hockey mask?
[149:59.79]The guy that is Jason, but he's not Jason.
[150:02.15]He's like a teenager in Ninja Turtles.
[150:03.61]That's Caelid Rimbaugh.
[150:06.27]I think it actually is Jason.
[150:07.54]His name is Jason, isn't it?
[150:10.58]What exactly is going on here?
[150:19.10]Casey Jason.
[150:21.60]Headshot beasts.
[150:24.30]Are you guys all... Why are you sneaking?
[150:33.61]Alright, I gotta defeat the spirit of Karnan.
[150:37.77]I can do that.
[150:38.25]Uh, one of the other- I think I only have one Ninja Turtle left.
[150:47.96]I'm just running in circles.
[150:49.34]Hey!
[150:49.46]Did I win?
[151:03.31]That was it.
[151:04.91]No, no, get back here.
[151:05.53]Get back here.
[151:06.05]No, don't fade.
[151:06.83]Don't do.
[151:07.25]No, come back here.
[151:08.31]Who's left?
[151:09.01]Raphael.
[151:14.05]Elemental grogs.
[151:15.05]Elemental grogs have devastating elemental attacks and are immune to attacks of their own element.
[151:19.82]Oh, God.
[151:20.28]You're going to throw this Pokémon shit at me now?
[151:23.16]When a grog roars, shoot it in the head with a charge stun to shoot it.
[151:27.22]I read it backwards.
[151:27.96]I understand.
[151:29.66]What kind of pervert is this?
[151:39.77]Oh no, the ooze!
[151:42.82]This is how it starts!
[151:43.70]This is how the movie starts!
[151:45.38]Just get in the ooze!
[151:47.72]See?
[151:49.56]He's just a regular turtle, but soon he's gonna be a ninja turtle!
[151:53.53]Me too!
[151:59.53]It's just like the fucking movie.
[152:01.41]The four turtles stand in the ooze, and then that guy comes and finds them.
[152:09.38]I need Elven Shot.
[152:13.78]Oh, fuck.
[152:15.82]I need to run faster.
[152:16.80]Why?
[152:17.40]Seriously.
[152:18.14]It is a poison swamp.
[152:19.77]It actually is the fucking poison swamp from Dark Souls.
[152:22.19]Because you run slow.
[152:31.08]That goes out so fast.
[152:39.22]Okay, well, his AI was deleted.
[152:51.26]One more.
[152:52.38]Okay, that was fun.
[152:54.22]That guy.
[152:54.90]Master Splintman.
[152:57.98]Master Von Splintman.
[153:02.40]Splinton Von Ratt.
[153:06.54]Where is this ship?
[153:07.94]Use charge shot to bring him down.
[153:10.60]Give me some arrows.
[153:11.42]Right in the head.
[153:12.56]We are bound together, you and I.
[153:38.27]What do you mean, leaving the mission area?
[153:44.01]He's flying around outside the mission area.
[153:56.02]That really was the fucking movie.
[154:01.13]I just did the movie.
[154:02.41]Fucking Desolation of Smaug.
[154:05.68]Jerma bard.
[154:06.28]The Bowman.
[154:10.83]Don't shoot toothless.
[154:12.47]Okay, so there's another... That's an... Okay.
[154:35.41]Is this an elaborate mission failed?
[154:38.73]Or... This is part of it, I guess.
[154:42.09]Paranormal activity.
[154:46.88]That does happen in every movie trailer.
[154:52.08]Every single horror movie that comes out nowadays has the person getting dragged on the floor back with their arms out, scary.
[154:59.63]What have we unleashed?
[155:03.74]Also, also, very important.
[155:06.27]In every single horror movie trailer, somebody gets thrown up in the air, smashing against a cabinet in the kitchen, and then lands on their face, on their stomach.
[155:16.13]A backstomach!
[155:17.67]Always kitchen, always kitchen cabinets.
[155:19.91]Every time. ...
[155:33.58]This is actually the first part.
[155:39.59]Yeah, oh, mirrors.
[155:41.41]Mirrors, too.
[155:43.41]You guys know, like, one guy has been responsible for, like, 80 of the last 100 horror movies we've gotten?
[155:52.14]It's the same one guy that's made them all.
[156:12.05]We hear your call.
[156:13.21]No, not George RR Martin.
[156:15.73]Yes, you will.
[156:19.49]It's the Jolly Green Giant.
[156:20.97]A deathless beast.
[156:25.12]It's annoying to me.
[156:26.64]My husband gets to pee on all the soup cans.
[156:30.34]But not me.
[156:32.95]Let me have some green bean glory for once.
[156:37.54]Go now.
[156:38.50]Your Balrog waits.
[156:41.55]He rises in doom's shadow.
[156:45.19]Fight till death and rise again.
[156:47.19]You will fight.
[156:49.79]Soon and soon.
[156:54.41]Death will defeat undead.
[157:05.95]M. Bison.
[157:07.71]Everybody just has to be M. Bison.
[157:15.42]Level up.
[157:16.96]Got a skill point.
[157:19.44]Got a little bonus.
[157:20.20]Gorgoroth.
[157:21.40]Gorgoroth.
[157:44.24]That was gonna be so funny.
[157:47.15]And it got ruined.
[157:49.35]This guy's just running away from a fucking caragor.
[157:52.07]Alright, who's tastier?
[157:55.17]Who's tastier?
[157:57.05]Yep, that's what I thought.
[157:58.35]I have an idea.
[158:07.56]Here's a snack.
[158:09.42]Eat him.
[158:10.54]I'm holding him for you so you can eat him.
[158:14.35]You didn't even eat him.
[158:16.65]Well.
[158:21.03]That's what you get.
[158:24.44]Sorry.
[158:28.24]Actually, I need you.
[158:34.76]Unlock skill.
[158:37.04]How we doing down here?
[158:40.24]This is hold to recover health and drain.
[158:44.47]Drain enemies are also dominated.
[158:46.07]Yes, they are.
[158:48.45]Draining an enemy replenishes elf shot.
[159:02.84]That's cool.
[159:04.28]Elven rage.
[159:07.03]Fiery blast.
[159:08.03]I think I want that.
[159:09.63]I'm always using the bow and arrow.
[159:15.05]Oh, what am I going to do?
[159:18.43]Three daggers can be thrown.
[159:19.35]Throw five daggers at once and you can hit multiple people.
[159:22.15]Wow.
[159:26.14]Ghouls will swarm the area.
[159:29.66]Spiders.
[159:38.97]Hmm.
[159:41.82]Your critical strike chance increases significantly as long as your history is above 20.
[159:45.40]That's cool.
[159:48.28]And you get more crit as you are in deep shit.
[159:54.45]I mean, we kind of have to do this, right?
[159:55.97]And then what's this one?
[159:56.55]Brutal Aggression.
[159:57.73]Might can be double charged, enabling brutal executions, which cause nearby enemies to flee in terror.
[160:04.71]Sure.
[160:07.89]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[160:11.49]Wraith can counter enemies while I do Grounds.
[160:13.63]That's so key.
[160:14.97]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[160:18.95]Alright.
[160:19.89]There's something right here.
[160:20.69]Let's just do this, whatever it is.
[160:26.37]Online Vendetta is another player's world.
[160:28.35]Enter another player's world and hunt their killer.
[160:31.90]And I get a loot chest.
[160:36.28]Why not?
[160:38.23]Get a loot chest here.
[160:39.17]Online.
[160:39.87]Avenge Comcast 59 by killing Kuga.
[160:45.33]Sure.
[160:48.25]This is their version of their online multiplayer nemesis.
[160:53.45]I get a loot chest.
[160:54.15]Might as well do it, right?
[161:01.76]King of Wales, thanks for the three bucks.
[161:06.66]Is that the guy?
[161:07.42]Is that the online person?
[161:11.64]Anyways, I like how chat has agreed with him over the fact that sometimes chicken is strange more than anything else in the history of the stream Let's go trigger the trap I'm gonna brutalize this guy because I just like I love watching people get brutalized Orcs especially
[161:39.59]Here we go, Ninja Turtles.
[161:40.51]Let's do it.
[161:43.43]And Master Splinter.
[161:46.53]I'm Casey Jones, Master Splinter, Leonardo Michelangelo, Donatello.
[161:53.18]Let's go.
[161:53.54]We have the entire crew.
[161:54.82]We just need April O'Neil.
[161:57.22]But that's like that assassin lady.
[161:58.58]She's not with us right now.
[162:01.04]Alright, let's do it.
[162:02.77]Trigger the trap.
[162:05.87]Kill.
[162:06.05]Kill.
[162:14.67]Let's do it!
[162:20.89]Leonardo!
[162:22.45]Leonardo, you're acting a little fucking extreme.
[162:27.24]Leonardo's the only one that came down.
[162:31.24]No, no, Zonatello came down too.
[162:35.32]Where's Splinter?
[162:39.16]Get her, Splinter!
[162:42.05]Get the fuck out of here.
[162:43.69]Oh no, they have their own splinters!
[162:48.13]Oh shit, they have their own ninja turtles!
[162:52.41]What renaissance painters are these guys?
[162:59.31]I just did it!
[163:01.27]Hit three enemies with a single area of effect attack.
[163:03.47]Isn't that what this is?
[163:06.35]Fuck it.
[163:12.96]Take down the statue.
[163:14.51]That guy's got a banner.
[163:20.51]Poison.
[163:20.83]Poison!
[163:23.37]Oh, there he is.
[163:24.33]The fuck did you just say?
[163:42.01]I'm just kidding.
[163:42.84]He is a little quick though.
[163:50.34]Do I have any fucking friends left?
[163:53.76]No one fights like Gaston.
[163:58.03]No one drinks like Gaston.
[163:59.67]No one else is incredibly quick like Gaston.
[164:06.17]Vigorating.
[164:10.58]Go like Gaston.
[164:13.58]That's why.
[164:16.04]There he is.
[164:29.89]Beautiful.
[164:30.33]Alright, there's the new target.
[164:32.79]That's the guy I gotta get rid of.
[164:34.95]Do I have any friends?
[164:35.75]Oh, shit.
[164:36.67]I gotta release you.
[164:42.91]Ow.
[164:46.55]I know he's down there.
[164:53.02]Predictable.
[164:54.74]What did I do?
[164:55.22]What did I do?
[164:56.80]Predictable streamer.
[164:57.60]What did I do?
[164:58.02]Gee, I can't be stealth.
[165:01.64]I can't stealth kill him.
[165:04.62]He's enraged by stealth, in fact.
[165:06.17]Alright, well, he can take hits in the face.
[165:09.09]Is he frozen?
[165:11.40]What the fuck is going on with this guy right now?
[165:15.07]I turned him into a statue.
[165:15.95]Jesus.
[165:33.42]Ayayay.
[165:34.54]Too many.
[165:36.18]Too many.
[165:37.16]Climb the wall.
[165:44.28]Buried in his head.
[165:45.00]Give me the nemesis.
[165:46.12]Got him.
[165:52.67]What did I do that was predictable?
[165:54.43]What happened?
[165:56.09]Is it because I sang the Gaston song for a second time?
[166:02.27]So I got a loot chest.
[166:03.01]Let's see what's in it.
[166:10.82]He predicted you.
[166:14.18]Oh, the orc called me predictable.
[166:20.64]Let's go open up this box.
[166:24.34]Completing an online vendetta rewards you with a vendetta loot chest in addition to spoils of war for you and the player you avenged.
[166:30.39]You can view and open your chest in the garrison section of the market.
[166:33.05]Okay, you can get legendary gear by fulfilling certain things.
[166:39.61]Okay, well let's...
[166:42.49]Let's go and open it.
[166:44.45]Okay, I have... Garrison.
[166:54.05]Alright, let's open it.
[166:56.94]Level 15, Vendetta Chest.
[167:00.68]I really hope I get that McCree skin.
[167:02.28]Actually, it is better.
[167:15.35]XP boost.
[167:18.09]Spoils of War boost.
[167:23.07]Yeah, these are all easy jokes, guys.
[167:24.89]They're not even... They're so easy to make that they're not even real jokes.
[167:29.29]Joke is such a bad word.
[167:30.19]I don't even like using the word joke.
[167:32.63]Jokes.
[167:34.45]Well, that's what I'm going to use.
[167:37.67]Six, my game is striking a dazed captain.
[167:42.09]And I get an enrage mechanic, essentially.
[167:49.36]No, it's not worth it.
[167:58.23]These are all terrible.
[168:02.15]A new hood, there it is.
[168:03.63]Not as good as the thing I have on currently, so goodbye.
[168:06.13]I need another piece of this set.
[168:13.37]Use the word joke more than anyone I know.
[168:15.15]I know, and I'm ashamed of it.
[168:21.60]I only have one piece for each.
[168:23.70]If I had two, maybe I'd put it on.
[168:24.92]Actually, I can... Let's see.
[168:40.20]Damn.
[168:43.87]49% less damage from enraged enemies.
[168:46.81]And there's almost a 20% chance that when I crit somebody, they get cursed.
[168:49.73]And a much higher percentage of damage reduced and higher health.
[168:55.95]Cool.
[169:00.77]And I got $300.
[169:01.07]$355.
[169:01.21]I got interest.
[169:01.61]So.
[169:01.78]Let's move over here.
[169:03.92]The Ring of Power.
[169:14.50]Orcs.
[169:14.92]You can grab an enemy off a mountain?
[169:16.16]I haven't even tried to do that yet.
[169:17.67]In fact, like, come here.
[169:18.93]Come over here.
[169:20.13]Hey, over here.
[169:20.55]Why am I doing this?
[169:22.33]I don't... I have this ability unlocked.
[169:23.61]Why would I need to do this?
[169:44.49]Bye-bye.
[169:50.05]Let's move.
[169:54.11]No, I don't need to stop.
[169:58.36]Stopping is wrong.
[169:59.60]Now let's go fight Ornstein and Smough.
[170:05.80]They're the next enemy.
[170:12.92]Ornstein.
[170:17.86]He's very far away.
[170:18.70]I probably should fast travel.
[170:24.59]Yeah, I think we're gonna have to do a fast travel here.
[170:31.75]Yeah.
[170:34.01]Where are we at?
[170:34.93]Ah, I don't even have it all.
[170:38.16]I have to go open that.
[170:40.26]Aye, aye, aye.
[170:43.77]Well, let's go get that place open.
[170:48.56]Go all the way around.
[170:49.46]We're on the fucking outskirts, just absolutely nowhere right now.
[170:58.74]No fast travel allowed, unfortunately.
[171:08.05]What?
[171:08.23]Is that saying that, like, a crowbar, a shovel is dead?
[171:15.27]Oh, okay.
[171:17.43]It's a clue.
[171:20.33]I thought that was trying to tell me that the shovel was dead.
[171:24.77]Here lies the shovel.
[171:29.50]Find Rosh Goodfink.
[171:35.88]Found him.
[171:37.91]I'm a thinker.
[171:40.73]I think good.
[171:42.29]I think hard.
[171:44.38]Harder than all the rest.
[171:45.80]That's what makes me the most bestest.
[171:48.42]Remember me now and hear me later.
[171:51.38]I am the absolute bestest.
[172:00.61]He's frozen.
[172:03.45]This guy's frozen.
[172:08.56]Enraged.
[172:09.00]We gotta bring in the Ninja Turtles.
[172:12.33]Let's start a fight in here.
[172:14.39]Time for a party.
[172:19.41]These big guys, like, just... Can't do anything about executions.
[172:29.36]The camera's really awkward in here, too.
[172:30.92]Is that guy dead?
[172:39.62]That was the easiest big ogre I've ever fought.
[172:41.66]Enraged by injury.
[172:51.99]Okay, it's just me and the turtles.
[172:54.06]I'm good.
[172:57.76]Really?
[173:00.86]Jesus, man.
[173:14.58]He's a Brick and Morty fan?
[173:18.00]What is with the Brick and Morty shit right now?
[173:23.25]Should I investigate down here?
[173:24.21]I'm just gonna look.
[173:25.39]Curious.
[173:27.67]There's a cave that ends.
[173:39.04]Nice.
[173:40.32]It has to be something random down here, right?
[173:41.88]Like a little box.
[173:43.68]Is there a loot chest down here?
[173:48.44]No, this just keeps going.
[173:49.40]Get me out of here.
[173:52.17]I don't want to fuck around there.
[173:53.03]Yeah, I'm just playing.
[173:58.73]I'm just playing on normal.
[174:04.66]I just saw normal, normal was selected, so I was like, sure, why not.
[174:08.00]Let's do normal.
[174:19.08]Sacrifice is worth it, thanks.
[174:22.98]Let's go.
[174:25.37]How much further do I have to go here?
[174:28.03]I have to go this way.
[174:30.03]I got distracted.
[174:30.79]We're not going to get distracted again.
[174:33.06]You can change difficulty any time in the options.
[174:38.94]Well, maybe even... Eventually, maybe I'll do that.
[174:46.52]Climb the tower.
[174:49.68]It's really good on Nemesis.
[174:53.37]Maybe.
[174:57.25]Does turning it on Nemesis make it so it doesn't show the prompts over their heads?
[175:07.43]Yeah, we didn't get distracted.
[175:08.69]We're doing exactly what we wanted to do.
[175:13.69]No, not this.
[175:14.73]How fast can I do this?
[175:23.07]I don't even do these missions either.
[175:24.37]I'm just, like I said before, I'm adding clutter on my mini-map and on my map.
[175:34.45]But just to not have to do it again.
[175:43.05]Many more.
[175:46.46]One more.
[175:50.16]Alright.
[175:50.56]You can hit B, but yeah, but I have to do it.
[175:54.94]I have to.
[175:55.38]We're gonna go this way to over there.
[176:06.55]It's still shocking to me that you can't get hurt by that.
[176:08.59]I was going for it.
[176:14.80]I don't know how I fucked it up.
[176:19.50]Ring of Power!
[176:22.53]The return of the new ring gives you the power of domination.
[176:25.03]It's time to forge an army.
[176:31.43]This is where you start to control captains right?
[176:32.93]Is this the guy?
[176:56.78]Well, you lose.
[176:58.12]He's going to tear his head off.
[177:00.85]Jesus.
[177:04.31]Bruise the chopper.
[177:10.55]He can recruit captains as followers to recruit a captain, attack him until he breaks, then hold B to dominate.
[177:15.53]Let's go.
[177:28.62]Snap the arm.
[177:29.22]Hip toss.
[177:33.60]He's arrow proof.
[177:34.67]Oh well.
[177:38.11]Just get down there.
[177:43.19]Oh well.
[177:48.19]Is he the funny Shrek character?
[177:50.81]I didn't get the dragon back, no, unfortunately.
[177:53.42]I wish.
[177:54.14]Here comes another guy.
[178:16.56]Right into his chest.
[178:21.04]More of this goofy cartoon shit!
[178:24.11]Can he swap me off his back like a bug?
[178:28.15]I hope not.
[178:36.70]I have to slide through his legs as I just stand there and get hit.
[178:41.43]Why are they fighting?
[178:45.49]What the hell are you guys doing?
[178:48.00]Why?
[178:49.70]What?
[178:51.02]Since when is like the thing on my team?
[178:56.62]I'm just gonna let this happen apparently.
[179:04.25]He's dead.
[179:04.85]Well, you tried.
[179:05.59]Do it again.
[179:08.15]One more time.
[179:13.01]Come on.
[179:14.82]No, I want to go through his legs.
[179:19.38]There we go.
[179:23.38]Break him.
[179:29.14]Define bug.
[179:32.88]Anything that has more than four legs is a bug.
[179:36.19]I can't go through my legs.
[179:51.40]Same thing really it results me ripping spines out, which I like to do anyway So either way is a win a fine addition to our man nice Bruce from here on out I will be your shadow.
[180:03.71]No one gets to you without my say so It will all follow eventually
[180:10.87]I want to be an orc in a movie.
[180:14.10]Looks like I can do a pretty good job.
[180:15.82]Squids are bugs?
[180:16.58]Squids don't have legs, they have tentacles.
[180:39.06]A tentacle essentially is one leg split into eight pieces.
[180:46.18]I'm talking separate legs.
[180:57.99]Squids don't even have bones.
[181:01.55]They don't have an exoskeleton like bugs do.
[181:06.89]Beruz wants to help.
[181:07.69]You defeat the Overlord and capture the fortress in Nirnin.
[181:19.97]This region is controlled by the fortress of Sharkburz, which is ruled by a fearsome Overlord.
[181:25.71]To begin your conquest of Mordor, you must assault and capture Sharkburz.
[181:29.53]Increase your army's strength by recruiting additional captains to serve as assault leaders in your assault force.
[181:34.78]Press right bumper to view the fortress siege upgrades.
[181:41.32]The Overlord's strongest troops are his war chiefs.
[181:43.30]They are responsible for the fortress's formidable defenses known as siege upgrades.
[181:47.70]You can draw out a war chief by undertaking a confrontation mission.
[181:51.76]Once drawn out, a war chief can be killed outright or dominated and recruited into your army.
[181:56.85]Killing or dominating a war chief before the assault disables his siege upgrade, weakening the fortress defense.
[182:05.15]Alright, this is new.
[182:06.55]Bruise has joined your assault force as an assault leader.
[182:10.29]Recruit additional captains to join the assault force and spend Myrion to purchase siege upgrades for them.
[182:19.08]Okay, so what do you got?
[182:22.36]The attacking army is strengthened with a group of explosive sappers who charge the fortress.
[182:28.50]Cavalry, the attacking army is strengthened with a group of Karagor riders.
[182:33.20]The attacking army is strengthened by the group of Olaghai, who can destroy fortress walls.
[182:36.76]I want that one.
[182:38.59]Can I get them all?
[182:41.43]I guess only one can be activated.
[182:43.27]I need another assault leader.
[182:44.37]Let me just see here.
[182:53.00]Sappers.
[182:54.48]I want these ones.
[182:57.04]Okay.
[182:57.92]Cool.
[183:01.40]Interesting.
[183:02.16]So, this is my guy.
[183:03.38]And the guy up here is the captain.
[183:07.93]And here are the war chiefs.
[183:10.17]So, I need to get these war chiefs.
[183:15.39]This is making me, like, really, really, really, really, really excited.
[183:20.01]Okay.
[183:22.45]Predator.
[183:22.85]I have brutalized poison tendril.
[183:25.73]Aim at a grog barrel and then press Y to poison it from afar.
[183:33.01]Additional enemy can be killed in stealth.
[183:35.37]What is this?
[183:36.05]Death Row.
[183:36.49]Okay, I already have it.
[183:39.46]Freeze pin.
[183:40.48]I'm gonna get this.
[183:41.12]I need to keep going down the range tree.
[183:44.76]Because I want this bird of prey.
[183:48.48]That's fun.
[183:49.30]I want to be able to do that.
[183:51.86]Cool.
[183:53.48]Really, really excited.
[183:57.00]Wait.
[184:00.35]No, just... I can upgrade this shit.
[184:03.49]I keep forgetting to quick throw.
[184:05.95]Okay, well now I can pin somebody and do a quick throw and get it right now.
[184:10.11]I'm going to do that right now so I don't fucking forget.
[184:12.01]Pin somebody and throw a knife at them and then upgrade the weapon.
[184:25.07]I pin and throw a knife at this guy.
[184:27.88]Alright, there we go.
[184:28.54]Done.
[184:30.12]I feel really bad.
[184:31.04]That was just mean.
[184:35.30]Get me out of here.
[184:39.80]That's all I wanted.
[184:41.41]I have lots of powerful skills now.
[184:46.81]Powerful skills.
[184:49.57]We both know I won't remember to do it.
[184:50.79]Well, I just did it.
[184:58.82]What the hell?
[184:59.48]Inventory.
[184:59.82]What the hell am I doing?
[185:03.04]Alright.
[185:04.22]Upgrade it.
[185:07.41]349.
[185:07.43]That's so much better.
[185:08.81]Quick throw replenishes one elf shot.
[185:10.67]You can do it once every 40 seconds.
[185:15.09]Let's see.
[185:16.41]It does.
[185:19.20]Let's go dominate a Witch King.
[185:23.87]The Nazgul are tracking you through Mordor using the power of the Palantir.
[185:26.89]Meet with Eltariel to face their threat.
[185:29.47]I mean, this is just 7,500 experience.
[185:32.03]I'm going to do it.
[185:35.57]Clean wounds, and they never unsheathe their weapons.
[185:39.71]This looks like Eltariel's work.
[185:41.68]She is indiscriminate.
[185:43.30]By the look of it, some of these would have made good followers.
[185:46.64]We must find her before she eliminates all our potential recruits.
[185:51.75]Got it.
[186:04.76]By the way, look at the top left corner.
[186:08.00]That's such a great icon.
[186:11.21]That's clearly like some dude's office sneakers, like office shoes.
[186:16.36]That's a nice pair of shoes.
[186:18.58]That's not boots.
[186:19.44]Those are not boots to like work and kill orcs with.
[186:21.18]That was like a monopoly shoe.
[186:21.92]Drink the worms.
[186:22.48]Stealth dominate archers.
[186:24.18]I don't think I have that ability right now.
[186:44.82]Barely certain I don't have that ability.
[186:48.99]No, I don't.
[186:55.93]Well, I wanted to stealth him, but... You were blind.
[187:01.27]Yeah, I don't have it.
[187:04.20]Shit!
[187:08.98]Come here.
[187:11.22]Automatic, it's like a stealth kill.
[187:13.75]Woo!
[187:39.06]That wasn't supposed to happen.
[187:40.18]I can guarantee you that.
[187:43.74]Let's go stealth dominate the archers.
[187:52.05]What's going on?
[187:52.63]Playground?
[187:53.15]Why are we talking about the playground over here?
[187:58.45]I'm seeing play... What?
[187:59.81]Playground insults?
[188:02.39]What happened?
[188:02.89]Why is everyone freaking out?
[188:10.36]Just dominate them all.
[188:16.99]Does it keep track of everyone you dominate now?
[188:21.63]So if I dominate everybody, does it just add to my list of people that I have?
[188:25.83]I guess, right?
[188:35.43]Well, she's over there fighting.
[188:39.76]He's attacking people.
[188:45.16]Is that an archer?
[188:49.86]This is an archer, right?
[188:50.88]I don't know.
[188:51.38]No, just captains.
[188:54.36]Okay.
[188:54.72]Thanks for the info.
[188:55.30]We're on Team Blue now.
[189:13.05]Just archers, but they're in random spots Hello I think I got auto-balanced
[189:36.28]The Shriekers make them.
[189:37.50]It's some kind of ritual.
[189:39.24]All very secret.
[189:40.66]I don't know where.
[189:41.46]I'm going to find the Shriekers.
[189:47.27]And then I'm going to put them under arrest.
[189:52.63]Oh, there she is.
[189:53.95]You're doing a good job sneaking around.
[189:56.09]Who cares?
[189:59.31]Just get them.
[190:03.96]The ritual to create the chosen.
[190:06.36]Where is it performed?
[190:07.72]No one knows.
[190:09.86]When a captain's selected, the shriekers send a worm to tell him where to go.
[190:14.00]Something about shriekers.
[190:18.26]We must tell Eltariel what we know.
[190:20.48]Alright, Eltariel.
[190:22.28]Let me do this first.
[190:24.91]Her mission is the destruction of the enemy that tracks us.
[190:29.17]The more information we share, the better.
[190:36.85]Sometimes when he does the little tumbles over stuff, it's like, man, you're going too fast.
[190:43.17]You need to slow down.
[190:46.66]Like, that was the worst possible way for me to get over here.
[190:48.66]I could have just walked forward.
[190:53.90]Were your messengers forthcoming?
[190:55.79]I thought that was a day-night cycle just happening way too fast.
[191:00.14]Close.
[191:25.80]Do I remember the password for my main YouTube account?
[191:28.52]Yeah, I made a video on there like three weeks ago.
[191:31.48]He didn't know.
[191:34.42]Talking about lots of stuff.
[191:36.80]Alright, dominate captains to prepare for the assault.
[191:40.52]Let's go get some captains.
[191:55.19]Let's get some worms.
[192:01.59]I need to find, what, five people?
[192:04.59]This person's just sweeping.
[192:08.51]You were just sweeping.
[192:09.29]That means you deserve to die.
[192:10.83]Is this your friend?
[192:16.21]Is he one of your co-workers?
[192:20.44]This is the end.
[192:25.05]Nobody sweeps.
[192:26.83]Have you noticed that in these open world games?
[192:29.39]There's always a bunch of NPCs that are sweeping.
[192:34.24]And at this point, it's kind of become like an insane trope because the orcs don't sweep.
[192:41.88]But it's just an NPCs, random NPCs have to be sweeping.
[192:46.35]Look at like all the Grand Theft Autos.
[192:48.59]This game.
[192:50.83]Other games that have like Skyrim.
[192:53.07]Somebody always has a broom in their hand.
[192:59.37]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
[193:00.85]Alright, let's go get this guy.
[193:08.95]Sweeping is the Wilhelm scream of animation.
[193:13.67]It actually... it is.
[193:16.20]It really is.
[193:16.98]It's the fucking Wilhelm scream of animation.
[193:25.36]Let's go get this guy.
[193:26.64]Army.
[193:28.10]Tag you.
[193:30.03]Dominate you.
[193:32.53]What are your desires?
[193:36.53]It tells you everything about them.
[193:39.01]What weird shit are you into?
[193:42.40]Clumsy.
[193:43.50]Soft targeting.
[193:44.26]Alright, so he's really vulnerable.
[193:46.98]It makes him really vulnerable when people are stealthy.
[193:54.28]Why do you keep going one more to the right?
[193:55.79]It's like his browsing history.
[193:59.85]Clumsy.
[194:00.81]Soft targetable.
[194:02.05]Fear of execution.
[194:03.39]Damage by executions.
[194:05.73]Here's his Pornhub tabs.
[194:09.35]Okay, let's go get him.
[194:13.99]Orc Tinder.
[194:14.69]This way.
[194:22.05]Well, didn't have to go very far.
[194:24.57]Whatever you say.
[194:25.55]Because I just got a free captain.
[194:28.79]Now I have another one.
[194:30.11]Okay, well now there's more.
[194:50.85]Fine.
[194:51.15]You want to have a dog fight here?
[194:52.35]You want to have a red versus blue animal fight?
[195:02.18]Oh no.
[195:02.74]One of my animals.
[195:10.42]Yeah.
[195:11.42]Yeah.
[195:12.93]Welcome to the team.
[195:19.31]Thank you for joining!
[195:20.95]We have great benefits!
[195:30.22]Gash Blade Sharpener.
[195:35.42]Banish from the army.
[195:36.32]Alright, you get out of here.
[195:41.75]Yeah, we should work together!
[195:45.93]Let me look at my army.
[195:48.58]Shame him.
[195:49.06]He's in my army now.
[195:49.90]Why would I do that?
[195:53.88]This guy's 16.
[195:54.32]I gotta get some higher levels.
[195:57.41]The attacking army is boasted with defenders.
[196:01.99]Savages, defenders, or hunters.
[196:04.49]Let's go.
[196:04.79]We need some, like, tanky guys.
[196:07.25]Good defenders.
[196:14.92]And on the way to where we were going before.
[196:16.80]This way.
[196:19.06]I might actually be able to fast travel there quickly.
[196:24.03]I think.
[196:26.21]Maybe.
[196:29.83]No.
[196:31.25]This is as close as I can come here.
[196:32.65]There's got to be another guy on the way, right?
[196:40.41]Yeah, there's an enemy captain here executing another captain.
[196:42.78]Let's just do that.
[196:43.26]I mean, that guy's really far away.
[196:46.68]We're looking for friends.
[196:49.51]Trying to make our... Are you following me?
[196:52.27]So I get like a follower here.
[197:18.02]Highlight your new follower.
[197:19.22]Well, I mean, obviously it kind of has to be... No, it's not you.
[197:22.54]It's this guy.
[197:23.58]What if he dies?
[197:29.69]And what's, like, what's with this weird, like, trajectory bullet thing?
[197:37.42]That's, like, who's in charge, right?
[197:38.48]Alright, command.
[197:39.54]Gosh.
[197:40.14]I just need to set this follower here as a bodyguard.
[197:42.90]Make him my bodyguard.
[197:43.86]Fine.
[197:48.21]That's pretty cool.
[197:51.89]Yeah, look at this.
[197:52.35]It's like... So the guy on the left has a sniper shot on the guy on the right.
[197:57.35]And the guy on the right is staring at the guy at the top of that pillar.
[198:01.88]The guy on that pillar is staring at this guy.
[198:05.72]What are they trying to say here?
[198:09.52]Is this some weird JFK conspiracy here?
[198:12.48]What is this?
[198:16.80]Let's go.
[198:23.93]Upgrade, unlock, summon bodyguard.
[198:30.51]Follow or set your... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:31.88]I can be summoned to fight beside.
[198:33.02]Summon your assigned bodyguard.
[198:34.20]Don't I already have?
[198:39.96]Wait a minute.
[198:40.74]So I have multiple... So what happens to my team of Ninja Turtles?
[198:51.59]He doesn't understand stuff that was in the first game.
[198:54.81]No, I'm just kidding.
[198:56.59]I know what it means.
[198:58.69]And by the way, I haven't played Shadow of Mordor in three years.
[199:01.27]I didn't... What?
[199:05.57]I'm just kidding.
[199:06.27]It's a joke.
[199:06.87]It's kidding around.
[199:07.61]We're kidding.
[199:08.13]We're kittens.
[199:08.85]We're just kittens.
[199:10.49]You're all a bunch of cats, okay?
[199:18.68]Where the fuck...
[199:23.91]Unknown captain versus unknown captain.
[199:25.54]That's fine.
[199:26.04]We're going to get them both.
[199:34.90]I want that guy.
[199:36.98]Who cares about the guy with the bow and arrow?
[199:38.39]Like, honestly...
[199:51.86]Like, I'm gonna go over something here real quick.
[199:54.46]So, how many guys have seen, like, for instance, like, like, okay, like, Breaking Bad, okay?
[199:59.44]I love Breaking Bad.
[200:00.44]Breaking Bad was a great show.
[200:01.88]Awesome fucking show.
[200:02.97]Beautiful show.
[200:03.89]I haven't watched Breaking Bad for, like, four or five years, right?
[200:09.45]So, let me ask you something.
[200:11.93]In, like, season two, episode four of Breaking Bad, can you repeat the conversation that him and Jesse had?
[200:18.09]No.
[200:19.11]No.
[200:21.31]You watched the show, but you know the bullet points of the whole show.
[200:25.53]But you can't remember specific details of every episode.
[200:28.28]That's the same thing.
[200:36.86]He said something about cooking meth.
[200:41.12]Like season 4, episode 6 of Breaking Bad.
[200:43.94]What happened?
[200:44.72]What happened in that episode?
[200:45.58]I don't fucking know.
[200:48.09]I have no idea.
[200:51.70]He hid, like, money under a floorboard.
[200:54.01]Right?
[200:54.73]Somewhere.
[201:06.65]Hold on a minute.
[201:07.11]This is gonna be good.
[201:10.41]I'm gonna steal this guy before he gets executed.
[201:15.34]Get up there!
[201:16.38]Jesus Christ!
[201:20.38]He's mine!
[201:29.27]Spoilers.
[201:30.03]Alright, uh... Go away, because I don't want you to die, because you're about to die.
[201:36.37]Alright, mission complete.
[201:42.09]And now I'm going to take you, too.
[201:46.19]You are now also mine.
[201:48.36]Get under there.
[202:00.14]What the fuck is this?
[202:01.74]Who's taking pictures?
[202:02.62]Sure.
[202:03.28]Yeah!
[202:04.46]Mount him.
[202:05.20]Do the backstab.
[202:25.88]I wish this did more damage, it doesn't really do very much.
[202:31.57]I guess it kind of does.
[202:32.47]He's immune to execution, so that's tidy.
[202:38.25]Ah, see he's the one taking the photos.
[202:55.26]I'm gonna sneak up behind him
[203:11.18]Here we go again.
[203:12.22]No, I missed.
[203:14.12]Oh.
[203:15.28]And you shot your own guy.
[203:16.66]I don't know why I didn't grab you.
[203:18.26]Get the fuck out of here.
[203:20.43]You annoying dickhead.
[203:22.11]Alright, how many times am I gonna do this?
[203:36.00]Here we go again.
[203:36.84]Ride the bull.
[203:42.26]Stop grabbing his crotch.
[203:43.60]I'm not.
[203:44.04]I'm sliding underneath him.
[203:48.24]He's immune to executions.
[203:49.24]I just forgot.
[203:50.77]That's still not dominable.
[204:01.59]There we go.
[204:02.91]What are you doing?
[204:03.97]Why do we keep- Why is this turning into like a TV show?
[204:26.24]If he's terrified of fire, there's nothing funnier than sending someone to clobber him with a fire weapon.
[204:32.38]Oh, that's proper music, that is.
[204:35.52]Okay, well, commanding and leveling captains.
[204:37.60]Go to the army menu to command your follower to target and kill an enemy captain.
[204:42.18]If your follower successfully completes his follower mission.
[204:45.86]Follower mission, oh dear.
[204:49.86]Yep.
[204:52.88]And he was standing up on like a platform like 500 yards away.
[204:58.49]We just took a commercial break.
[205:01.37]In the middle of the action.
[205:02.53]You don't do that.
[205:03.57]You never do that in any show.
[205:04.79]This is made by like... I thought like this is Lord of the Rings.
[205:08.11]Don't they know basic television at this point?
[205:12.69]Highlight a follower.
[205:13.57]This guy's not a follower yet.
[205:16.67]How about this random guy?
[205:20.07]No, don't... I don't want you to kill this guy.
[205:31.53]Sure.
[205:31.99]Okay.
[205:33.03]Go kill him.
[205:34.35]The guy that I'm standing right next to.
[205:40.47]Like Nemesis missions, follower missions are active for a limited time.
[205:43.63]When the counter below the mission expires, the mission is automatically resolved.
[205:47.96]Your follower will attempt to complete this follower mission on his own, but you can join him to ensure his success.
[205:54.10]If he is successful, he will increase his level.
[206:02.16]Alright, let's see what happens.
[206:06.98]Let's see.
[206:10.45]I thought that was him up there.
[206:11.63]Alright, go get him!
[206:21.23]Found him?
[206:21.63]Who found him?
[206:29.51]He's trying to flashbang me.
[206:31.97]It's actually working.
[206:38.45]It's Grog all over again.
[206:44.81]Not again.
[206:45.29]Here's the only difference.
[206:46.66]This guy has flashbangs.
[206:57.00]Fucking just get over it.
[206:59.34]No, what are you doing?
[207:00.40]Alright, this guy's the new guy we're getting.
[207:18.13]So I can't just dominate him.
[207:19.25]Can I just end this nonsense?
[207:21.25]Who did that?
[207:23.21]He didn't do that.
[207:25.12]I don't even care.
[207:26.80]He's mine.
[207:27.70]Recruit.
[207:28.20]Fuck the dumb follower mission.
[207:29.27]Go retreat.
[207:29.89]Get out of here.
[207:32.27]Where's Mr. Fink?
[207:33.55]This guy's gonna be ours now.
[207:56.33]Ow.
[207:57.65]Ow.
[208:02.11]Ow.
[208:02.83]I'm trying too hard to, like, perfectly time these.
[208:09.23]They're not really doing me any favors.
[208:11.30]Mm-hmm.
[208:12.36]Come here, you.
[208:26.81]This guy's gotta go.
[208:27.91]I gotta throw him the spirit.
[208:28.74]Whoa, didn't even know he was doing that.
[208:35.62]Okay.
[208:39.64]What are you doing?
[208:41.12]Get out of here!
[208:41.84]Why don't you get the fuck down here and help me instead of just doing these weird like did you know commercial breaks?
[209:02.82]And you'd be a drongo to trust an orc anyway, so it all works out.
[209:06.79]Go on, have a go.
[209:09.17]I know they did this on purpose as like a joke, but like really.
[209:12.93]Warchiefs use the fight pits to ritually select their bodyguards.
[209:16.27]Command a follower to infiltrate a warchief as a bodyguard by proving himself in the pits.
[209:21.74]He will betray his master the next time you encounter him, stabbing the warchief in the back.
[209:26.82]You can also command a follower to infiltrate an empty garrison in the fortress, where he'll capture a victory point in your eventual siege.
[209:37.03]Okay.
[209:40.39]How about the guy we just got?
[209:44.45]I will go with the guy we just got.
[209:45.95]This guy.
[209:48.25]Select a warchief.
[209:49.23]Yeah, this guy.
[209:50.21]No, we need a warchief.
[209:53.17]Okay.
[209:53.71]You...
[209:56.43]Alright, he's got his eye on him.
[209:58.15]Okay, we'll spy on this guy.
[210:03.75]Do it.
[210:05.21]Your follower must survive the fight pits before becoming a spy.
[210:08.38]You can watch fight pit battles, but in order to maintain your follower's cover, you cannot intervene.
[210:12.60]Gee, there's a lot here.
[210:19.04]Oh, there's the Warchief.
[210:22.80]Okay.
[210:24.20]Hopefully he does a good job.
[210:30.98]Alright, I'm in the middle... I was in the middle of a fight.
[210:34.07]With... God damn it.
[210:37.77]And he's gonna get away.
[210:51.16]Get... your... butt... over here.
[210:54.94]I need this guy.
[210:56.14]Adapted.
[210:58.58]He's adapted.
[211:00.74]He adapted to try to escape.
[211:04.98]And... You are mine.
[211:09.28]Good fank ain't getting away.
[211:18.70]Command.
[211:21.42]No, just go away.
[211:23.60]I think I have enough, right?
[211:26.24]I believe I have enough.
[211:32.04]So let's see here.
[211:34.32]Let's get to a safe zone.
[211:37.41]Jump with the puke.
[211:40.35]Jump with the pus.
[211:44.03]Hide in here for a minute.
[211:47.23]Skill point!
[211:52.45]Wrath.
[211:55.99]This is pretty helpful.
[211:58.25]I've been neglecting these
[212:03.14]I got too focused on the dragon shit.
[212:09.11]Alright.
[212:09.73]Let's go to... The army.
[212:13.51]Siege upgrades.
[212:16.87]Assault leader!
[212:18.61]So let's have... Who's the highest level here?
[212:22.66]The bruise is already there.
[212:25.32]Where is he?
[212:25.94]Where's Martin?
[212:30.82]Where's Mr. Fink?
[212:34.34]There he is.
[212:37.26]You got this one already.
[212:38.18]Level 20.
[212:40.30]Alright, I got Fink.
[212:42.42]Fink and Bruise.
[212:45.12]Should be good to go.
[212:54.66]Did I call them Martin?
[212:55.70]Did I call them Martin?
[212:59.76]Isn't there a movie called like Martin Fink?
[213:01.66]Like Barton Fink or something?
[213:03.95]Yeah, there was.
[213:07.13]John Leguizamo.
[213:08.67]No, John Totoro.
[213:13.35]The Etten.
[213:14.89]Well, I don't even know who this is yet, so maybe I shouldn't do this.
[213:31.77]Should we just go no-name this guy?
[213:33.17]I mean, he is a no-name.
[213:37.74]Level 120 versus a SWAT force level 100.
[213:39.46]This might not be a good idea.
[213:45.64]We aren't doing this.
[213:48.42]Not yet, at least.
[213:49.16]Let's get some info.
[213:53.22]Let's get info from a worker worm.
[214:00.66]Get some intel on the Warchiefs.
[214:05.50]Be killed instantly using stealth.
[214:06.95]That's good to know.
[214:08.49]Cool.
[214:12.85]Really?
[214:15.51]Don't be a fucking hero, dude.
[214:24.68]Alright.
[214:25.66]Let's get to the quests.
[214:28.68]Quest time.
[214:31.79]So this is the fortress.
[214:36.43]Trap.
[214:40.16]Massacre.
[214:41.02]Can draw people out by killing waves of enemies.
[214:44.36]Now here's the spy.
[214:50.35]As Tarmo Skinpeeler must defeat an enemy captain to prove himself and become a spy.
[214:54.91]Let's go check this out.
[214:56.55]That's interesting to me.
[215:00.88]We can just... Am I gonna not fast drop?
[215:04.24]Am I in combat right now?
[215:07.44]Of course I am.
[215:12.86]Stay here.
[215:22.88]I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[215:28.83]There it is.
[215:33.09]He has to beat... My Pokémon has to beat their Pokémon.
[215:38.61]They're just very large Pokémon.
[215:42.84]Okay.
[215:43.96]As Tarmo Skinfielder must defeat an enemy captain to prove himself.
[215:46.66]I don't know who it is, but hopefully he wins.
[215:48.10]Level 11.
[215:53.79]It's easy.
[215:54.37]Easy win.
[216:03.00]It's the same voice.
[216:10.83]It's the same person.
[216:13.99]They're both the same guy.
[216:15.19]Holy shit, he's kicking his ass.
[216:17.53]They both did the same flashbang move.
[216:22.19]Got him.
[216:24.19]It's a mirror match.
[216:28.25]Gained four levels.
[216:32.82]Flashback.
[216:33.70]That was just a game of rock, paper, scissors.
[216:38.32]Mirror.
[216:41.57]What did I get for gear?
[216:45.41]That was awesome.
[216:47.57]I want to do that again.
[216:48.95]Can I just do this for the rest of the game?
[216:53.17]There he is.
[216:54.13]He's getting so much more power.
[216:59.03]Okay, there he is.
[216:59.53]Command.
[217:00.55]If you issue a command to this follower, he'll no longer be able to act as your spy.
[217:04.11]No.
[217:04.17]Okay, I want to do that again, though.
[217:06.94]Alright, let's... Bink Man.
[217:08.52]Where's Bink?
[217:11.46]Okay, Bink.
[217:14.44]I want you to infiltrate.
[217:15.70]Where have you infiltrated?
[217:16.60]You've infiltrated this guy.
[217:17.36]Become a spy.
[217:28.94]Now we got a new spy mission.
[217:30.32]That's the funnest thing for me.
[217:32.96]Here's another one.
[217:34.44]It's right here already.
[217:39.08]Did I, like, fucking break it?
[217:40.20]What's going on?
[217:40.64]Let's see this again.
[217:43.95]Alright, we got... We got Rash Dinkmaster.
[217:47.77]Level 16 versus an unknown captain.
[217:50.01]Infiltrate.
[217:55.65]16 versus 16 Defense versus off Wow.
[217:57.35]Oh my god.
[217:57.85]Did he just push you?
[218:00.01]This is an easy win for him deep the best offense is a good defense
[218:24.57]This guy doesn't have any way to protect himself.
[218:27.58]Plus, Bink has a spear, which means he automatically wins every time.
[218:31.32]This is what I was talking about!
[218:32.22]Look at this shit!
[218:35.60]Game over.
[218:40.99]He's gonna get four levels from this.
[218:45.57]Gained two levels.
[218:46.57]He's 18 now.
[218:47.21]Got some gear.
[218:53.60]I think that's my favorite part about the game so far, is that.
[218:55.76]I just want to keep recruiting captains and having them fight in the pits.
[219:00.68]Wait a minute, what's this?
[219:08.53]Nakra.
[219:08.87]Okay.
[219:10.63]Search the area for Nakra.
[219:22.62]Nakra the Dread.
[219:29.66]There he is.
[219:32.84]He's vigilant against stealth.
[219:36.78]There's too much to do.
[219:37.68]There's too many things to do.
[219:41.08]Another online vendetta.
[219:43.22]No, I don't want to do an online vendetta.
[219:50.34]Nakra the Dreadful.
[219:53.07]I know it was dead.
[219:53.79]Come here.
[219:56.93]I want to stealth dominate him.
[220:22.31]How does the game compare to the first one?
[220:29.38]Well... They kinda... They kinda took the same exact game and added a bunch of stuff to it.
[220:36.90]So imagine if Shadow of Mordor had another three years of development.
[220:42.59]It's very much a similar game, if not like the same game.
[220:46.01]With a bunch of added stuff.
[220:52.86]What?
[220:54.02]He's not broken?
[220:57.06]Well, he will be soon.
[220:58.10]Yeah, there it is.
[221:00.18]It's the same, but more, you know.
[221:19.32]A thousand years and he's level one.
[221:21.04]Make a spy, yes!
[221:23.52]No, wait.
[221:26.76]All of a warchief's bodyguards are conspiring against him.
[221:29.60]Join them in a betrayal mission.
[221:33.81]Are you kidding me?
[221:34.89]Oh, he was the last captain for that warchief.
[221:38.65]That's awesome.
[221:41.29]So we're about to fucking mutiny this guy.
[221:48.07]Betrayal.
[221:50.33]Hoorah Deathblade's bodyguards are leading him into an ambush.
[221:53.75]Defeating the Warchief disables poison spouts.
[221:55.87]Alright, this is the guy that can die instantly by stealth.
[221:58.99]Yeah, okay.
[221:59.31]That's all I need to know.
[222:01.20]Let's do it.
[222:04.04]There he is.
[222:04.88]Look here!
[222:06.70]Just our luck.
[222:08.42]Running into the blasted ranger.
[222:11.90]Might as well make him bleed.
[222:14.42]Take steel, master!
[222:16.84]Betrayal!
[222:18.28]Whoa!
[222:23.49]Okay.
[222:24.07]Oh, he's level 21.
[222:25.03]I gotta get down there and save my... That guy's level 11.
[222:28.15]Of course, like, the noob jumps in first.
[222:34.25]The random, like, noob jumps in first.
[222:40.06]Okay.
[222:46.18]Nice fucking ultimate warrior move.
[222:49.82]Oh, fuck it.
[222:50.30]I'm trying to stealth kill him.
[222:59.28]But wait a minute!
[223:01.12]Wait a minute!
[223:01.54]No, get... I wanna... He's broken.
[223:07.54]I wanna... I wanna dominate this guy.
[223:11.25]What the hell, dude?
[223:12.15]Come on!
[223:12.69]I'm trying... Can you just chill for a second?
[223:28.58]Whatever.
[223:30.00]Yeah, nice job.
[223:31.12]Just because he was enraged, he wouldn't stop.
[223:33.04]Now where are they going?
[223:42.62]Alright, so now we've got one Warchief done.
[223:47.56]Let's get the other Warchief too.
[223:48.64]Let's give her to him.
[223:50.23]Or, you know, do what I wanted to do and dominate him.
[223:55.41]So let's go back to the Orc.
[223:57.99]The army menu.
[223:58.53]So this guy's dead.
[224:02.07]This guy is currently being... This is his other champion.
[224:08.18]He is currently spying on him.
[224:12.56]Okay.
[224:15.20]So we gotta deal with this guy.
[224:21.74]Hmm.
[224:30.36]Where is he?
[224:35.52]Oh, Jesus.
[224:36.38]So he is...
[224:44.53]I don't think I can do that, because he's in there with his buddy.
[224:47.73]I don't think I can dominate that guy.
[224:53.53]I have to draw the Warchief, though.
[224:57.43]Alright.
[225:01.75]You know, I think we're good.
[225:04.59]Yeah, I have to wait.
[225:10.89]I could attack this place now, right?
[225:13.94]This is the only guy here, and he has two bodyguards, and one of them is my guy.
[225:20.00]So all they have for their defenses for Warchiefs and shit is this guy, this guy, and one of his bodyguards is my dude.
[225:35.17]I need intel on him.
[225:36.91]Let's get some intel.
[225:42.52]Go for the Warchief.
[225:43.44]Well, don't I want to draw the Warchiefs out?
[225:46.24]And, like, infiltrate them and shit?
[225:47.47]Isn't that, like, the whole point?
[225:49.97]I mean, I could just go kill the Warchief right now, or go take the Warchief, right?
[225:54.93]But, where is this guy?
[226:05.27]Alright.
[226:06.01]New intel learned.
[226:07.23]Dazed by stealth.
[226:09.64]So can I now do anything about you?
[226:18.05]I guess I have to just mark him then, huh?
[226:24.37]Wait, who am I modding?
[226:29.08]I don't think I can... Yeah, that guy is only... I have to draw the Warchief out.
[226:37.10]That's the only way.
[226:40.65]Let's just do that, then.
[226:44.19]Make one of my orcs a warchief.
[226:47.01]Well, isn't that only possible if, like, this guy dies?
[226:49.91]Let's see something.
[227:04.26]So, what if I command you...
[227:09.20]Yeah, I don't care about him.
[227:10.70]Can I get him to kill him, right?
[227:15.14]I can't.
[227:17.44]Infiltrate.
[227:26.49]So, now... Oh, wait.
[227:29.15]I can't, like, command him.
[227:30.77]Resolve the current... God damn it.
[227:37.12]Well, it's right here.
[227:42.80]Deaf Jerma.
[227:43.46]No, it's just so much information at the same time.
[227:47.06]It's hard to pay attention to fucking the 3,000 things you can do in this game.
[228:02.05]Move.
[228:04.37]I don't... Can you make these guys Warchiefs?
[228:07.75]I think I have to, like, take over the castle first, right?
[228:12.61]Let's see.
[228:15.29]No.
[228:15.59]I'll start the mission, not grab a dude.
[228:22.36]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[228:22.98]Like, I can only make people the warchief after the raid.
[228:25.66]After I take over the capital.
[228:31.90]I can't just, like, make him be a warchief.
[228:33.50]Like, I have to destroy the castle.
[228:38.37]Oh, this guy might die.
[228:46.66]Why does he get two dogs, too?
[228:50.68]That seems very unfair.
[228:51.82]That's so unfair!
[228:55.43]This guy has to fight three people.
[228:56.89]That's terrible.
[228:59.77]Come on, resolve it.
[229:12.12]I can't even interfere in this, can I?
[229:21.95]This he wins, alright.
[229:23.45]Alright, I'm gonna, like, go sleep in bed and, like, put, like, twelve hours forward.
[229:33.47]I gained five levels, holy shit.
[229:41.37]Alright, let's go fast travel.
[229:47.77]Right here.
[229:48.17]Just advance time.
[229:51.29]I could have hit X. Alright, let's see what happens.
[230:01.00]Let's see what happens here.
[230:02.44]Battle reports.
[230:08.52]Nothing happened.
[230:10.00]Nothing really new happened.
[230:12.39]Wait, isn't this... Okay, that's not my friend, right?
[230:18.98]Oh, Jesus!
[230:20.06]Jesus!
[230:21.70]Fishy!
[230:22.54]Thank you, FishyRJ, for the 50 bucks.
[230:26.28]5,000 bits from Fishy.
[230:29.92]That's a lot of cash being dropped.
[230:32.76]A stack of 5,000 ones.
[230:36.94]Cut in half.
[230:38.42]And cut in half again.
[230:39.84]And then...
[230:41.71]Remove $75 from it.
[230:45.11]But if you read this, I just want you to know how you've been... If you read this, I just want to know how you've been doing.
[230:50.02]Always love the streams.
[230:50.94]You're good at brightening days.
[230:53.24]With a smiley face.
[230:54.02]Well, thank you.
[230:56.22]Very kind of you, Fishy.
[230:56.98]My day is going well.
[230:59.35]It's going good.
[231:00.11]Playing some Mordor.
[231:02.27]Tomorrow night, if you're wondering what we're doing tomorrow, we're going to play The Evil Within 2.
[231:07.54]Scary game.
[231:09.32]Lots of new games coming out.
[231:10.88]The last couple weeks has been insane, really, for releases.
[231:13.16]We've got a lot of good new shit to play.
[231:18.89]But I'm doing great.
[231:19.49]Hopefully your day is going well as well.
[231:21.53]Hopefully you're doing good too.
[231:24.33]But yeah, it's going to be fun.
[231:25.01]It's going to be a scary night.
[231:28.43]So...
[231:31.95]This guy still has... Nothing really happened.
[231:36.21]Nobody really moved.
[231:39.61]Alright, um... Let's just drag this guy out.
[231:48.89]Let's just kill this fucking guy.
[231:57.39]Will we see this game in another stream?
[231:58.65]Because I've been enjoying you dick around with orcs.
[232:01.30]Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[232:03.16]There's so many... Because there's so many games... Got it!
[232:25.14]Well, got it.
[232:28.88]We actually get to play with the dragon now.
[232:33.44]I'm just going to land right here.
[232:40.90]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[232:42.18]Come.
[232:42.56]Get down here.
[232:50.24]Set up the trap.
[232:52.78]Shocker the Deviler has set a trap for his enemies.
[232:54.78]Draw him up by walking into it.
[232:59.89]Well, I got a trap of my own.
[233:00.85]Get the trap.
[233:01.11]I lost the dragon.
[233:01.69]Did I?
[233:01.95]I guess not.
[233:02.27]Oh, well.
[233:02.57]It's a wyvern.
[233:02.97]No, you are right.
[233:04.32]It's okay, though.
[233:30.80]So two of his bodyguards are my friends.
[233:32.74]So why should I be concerned at all?
[233:38.50]Jesus.
[233:44.89]There's the trap.
[233:46.53]Let's hop up on this, please.
[233:56.03]Really fun movement.
[234:07.91]Three enemies with a single area of effect attack.
[234:10.69]I guess that can last the whole time, huh?
[234:23.04]Parkour.
[234:26.34]That is cool that it adds every time you hit the new land you press A. There's the trap.
[234:38.05]This game is a bunch of fun.
[234:39.29]There's a ton of stuff to do.
[234:40.57]It's a lot to think about.
[234:41.39]There's a trap.
[234:45.39]Just land.
[234:47.50]Right.
[234:52.58]Oh no, the trap!
[234:54.82]He's got his bodyguard with him.
[234:56.68]Oh no, what am I going to do?
[234:57.68]Get him!
[235:08.16]That slow... He's already dead!
[235:12.02]I didn't have to go... Wow.
[235:13.59]It's already over.
[235:15.75]Let me join the party.
[235:17.61]Wait, wait a minute.
[235:18.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[235:19.13]Wait, wait.
[235:19.55]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[235:20.11]Let me break him.
[235:23.69]Got him.
[235:26.40]You cannot recruit this captain because his level is too high.
[235:28.58]To decrease a captain's level, press Y to shame him.
[235:32.96]Shame!
[235:40.71]He survived, he lost five levels.
[235:43.22]The fortress is weakened.
[235:44.28]Defeating this Warchief is disabled.
[235:45.52]Savage host.
[235:50.86]Now what?
[235:52.84]What the fuck is going on?
[236:02.56]What about you?
[236:04.50]Where are you going?
[236:08.44]Don't you fight the Bright Master!
[236:16.82]Mm-hmm.
[236:20.96]Retreat.
[236:21.36]Let's go back to base.
[236:23.48]Alright.
[236:28.81]I think it's time.
[236:29.57]I think it's time to attack the castle.
[236:32.27]Let's go for a siege here.
[236:38.01]Although, what is, um... Here's the siege.
[236:44.51]What's all the way down here?
[236:45.90]Wait, checkpoint raid?
[236:49.32]Chakra is raiding another captain's checkpoint.
[236:53.20]Let's do it.
[236:53.52]Let's take this place.
[236:54.34]Let's go for it.
[236:55.22]I want to try it.
[237:03.38]Let's take the fortress.
[237:05.33]I got a couple of captains.
[237:06.71]Let's make sure I get the right people there.
[237:12.69]Let me see.
[237:13.11]Hold on.
[237:18.68]What's the quick way to get to the army screen?
[237:20.96]It's like holding a certain button.
[237:25.91]Okay, there's nobody there.
[237:28.15]He's dead, so hold on.
[237:35.32]Infiltrate.
[237:36.46]Be the new warchief.
[237:38.74]Send?
[237:39.20]Hold on.
[237:39.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[237:42.36]We got to get somebody that's really good and strong.
[237:45.32]Not this guy.
[237:46.00]18.
[237:47.82]18.
[237:47.84]14.
[237:47.86]18.
[237:49.12]It's going to be after.
[237:54.00]It's going to be Raj.
[237:55.80]Raj.
[237:56.48]Raj Agul.
[238:00.11]Yeah.
[238:00.75]Go for it.
[238:04.23]Bruise.
[238:05.23]You don't want to be this guy?
[238:07.45]What if Bruise dies?
[238:10.17]Fine, I'll mod bruise.
[238:11.37]You want me to moderate him?
[238:12.43]I can't.
[238:17.23]I can't.
[238:17.51]I cannot interact with him.
[238:19.64]Sorry, guys.
[238:20.32]I can't mod bruise.
[238:22.26]I only have one mod slot open.
[238:24.38]This is me.
[238:26.74]This is all of you guys.
[238:27.68]I mean, you guys are like infighting to get to be the fucking new mod.
[238:32.09]One of you died.
[238:32.67]I don't know who it was.
[238:36.67]But I only got one mod slot, and this guy... This is like a Twitch staff.
[238:40.49]I can't mod him.
[238:44.59]I'm going to have to go... I want it to be Fink.
[238:50.64]Go for it.
[238:56.58]Let's go see if he does it.
[239:00.40]Mark it on the map.
[239:02.20]Mark it.
[239:03.79]For a second?
[239:04.25]Okay.
[239:05.83]Look, look, look, look.
[239:08.23]Mark target.
[239:10.11]Mark it.
[239:12.35]Passingly, I'm just like, yeah.
[239:14.37]Mark that.
[239:15.08]Mark it.
[239:23.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[239:24.62]Here, the new infiltration mission.
[239:26.08]Mark it on the map.
[239:27.83]Where is it?
[239:28.89]All the way down here.
[239:29.59]Fucking hell.
[239:34.38]Mod me, Bright Lord.
[239:39.39]Who's the guy that got randomly modded?
[239:41.77]I've only done that like twice.
[239:44.19]Actually, I've done that like four times.
[239:45.71]Okay, now I should be able to fast travel, right?
[239:57.84]Yeah.
[240:03.19]Excuse me.
[240:12.16]Just on my way to the fighting pits.
[240:13.48]I want to watch my buddy become a new warchief.
[240:19.31]And one of these random dickhead captains is not going to beat Fink.
[240:22.37]Not a chance.
[240:28.94]Thirteen.
[240:34.48]This is gonna be... He's gonna hit him.
[240:40.88]It's another mirror match, but it doesn't matter because he's gonna die in one swing.
[240:44.99]This is who you got for a potential Warchief?
[240:49.07]One swing and he's dead.
[240:49.89]Watch this.
[240:50.47]Three.
[240:51.31]Two.
[240:52.27]One.
[240:53.41]Action.
[240:54.17]Come on, use your EX meter!
[240:59.81]Nice.
[241:03.20]You're not gonna let this guy break your combo.
[241:09.72]Really?
[241:12.14]This is embarrassing.
[241:14.36]You are so much higher than him.
[241:15.84]Don't let this guy even put a scratch on you.
[241:22.25]Oh no, he's charging up.
[241:25.83]Can't you do that in Street Fighter and you can do a super move?
[241:28.90]He's charging his EX, that's what just happened.
[241:34.80]He just did the Dragon Ball Z move.
[241:40.80]He just drank a fucking Estus.
[241:43.25]What BM?
[241:46.41]That's it, he wins.
[241:47.69]New Warchief.
[241:54.01]They really should have let you control this.
[241:55.71]They could have even given you better moveset if your recruit was higher level.
[242:00.65]Yeah, that would have been really cool, actually.
[242:07.03]Now that you mention that, I wish that was a thing.
[242:09.80]Be fun.
[242:11.00]Alright, Fink.
[242:12.66]Command.
[242:15.44]If you command this follower to kill a Warchief, they will fight a pitched battle.
[242:19.71]Win or lose, your follower will be exposed as a spy and will no longer be able to sabotage the fort.
[242:25.69]But don't I want him to be his good friend?
[242:30.56]Or should I just keep him there?
[242:31.42]Alright, what about you?
[242:36.56]Alright.
[242:39.50]No, not new top command.
[242:40.42]This captain is involved in an active mission.
[242:46.23]Alright, I want Ushak to be the new Warchief over here.
[242:55.34]No, you know, this guy's level 11.
[242:56.42]I'm going to give this guy a chance.
[242:57.40]You know what I mean?
[242:58.22]Let's make him the new Warchief.
[243:00.52]We need to pass a little time, though.
[243:04.74]Yeah, let's pass some time.
[243:13.21]That guy, we're going to put all of our chips on that guy.
[243:18.09]And then we'll just see how he does.
[243:20.51]Because who gives a shit about that guy?
[243:23.27]Let's let that guy prove us wrong, right?
[243:28.50]Why did I just do that when I could have easily?
[243:31.94]He's going to fight somebody?
[243:35.75]Oh, he is going to fight.
[243:36.75]Hold on, he's preparing to raid this guy's camp.
[243:49.66]Should I help him?
[243:53.60]Just start the tutorial siege already.
[243:56.88]I'm having fun!
[243:57.78]Well, that's with everybody wanting me to, like, blow through everything as fast as possible.
[244:05.67]There's a ton of fun things to do.
[244:07.07]I, like, I want to do it.
[244:09.57]I don't want to just blow through every single mission as fast as I can.
[244:13.41]This is cool shit.
[244:15.89]Let's go.
[244:16.27]I'm doing it.
[244:24.04]Help him, he cares about you.
[244:26.02]There's like so much content to see.
[244:31.36]I wanna see it.
[244:36.09]Oh, this guy's fucking dead.
[244:47.33]I'm sorry.
[244:50.71]Do what you want.
[244:51.37]No, I'm obviously just teasing.
[244:54.71]That was me.
[245:00.45]The point is, you don't want to rush things.
[245:04.69]I only have so much time on this planet.
[245:06.21]I don't want to rush the siege.
[245:09.25]Like, that matters.
[245:10.05]Guys, we only get one life to live.
[245:12.87]I don't want to rush the tutorial siege.
[245:16.67]Alright, where is he?
[245:17.19]Down there?
[245:33.40]Come here!
[245:38.76]God damn it!
[245:41.94]I wanted to...
[245:46.58]Well, well.
[245:47.18]They gained seven levels from that.
[245:52.29]Well, okay.
[245:53.77]He dropped a ring, too.
[245:59.25]I want my fucking tutorial siege.
[246:01.75]Hey!
[246:03.07]Listen!
[246:05.43]It's not that big.
[246:06.25]It's fine.
[246:06.77]Everything's gonna be fine.
[246:09.15]I want my two warchiefs for the tutorial.
[246:18.11]What's going on here?
[246:19.02]Oh, this guy's getting attacked.
[246:28.64]Four critical hits in a row.
[246:31.45]Tutorial C. It's not even a tutorial C. No camp raids.
[246:36.41]Alright, let's get... Time to go.
[246:41.81]Make tutorial orc warchief.
[246:44.27]Stop it.
[246:47.88]Stop it.
[246:50.96]18, 18.
[246:51.50]Okay, where's the tutorial orc?
[246:54.64]Alright, this, this, this dickhead.
[247:03.85]Because if he... He's currently like on a mission, of course he is.
[247:08.63]Alright, you.
[247:08.97]You.
[247:11.37]The blade shocker.
[247:13.13]You're the new warchief.
[247:18.45]The tutorial never ends.
[247:22.61]Let's go do it.
[247:26.89]I think it was Ogg.
[247:28.31]Ogg is dead.
[247:31.10]Ogg is dead.
[247:31.94]I killed Ogg and he never came back.
[247:34.60]I had a nemesis for the first four hours of the game and he decided he's done.
[247:38.24]I don't think he wants to come after me anymore.
[247:47.91]You don't listen to chat.
[247:49.53]I do listen to chat, though.
[247:50.59]That's the thing.
[247:52.61]I always listen to chat.
[247:54.61]Because chat always has fun ideas.
[247:56.59]Like, 8% of the time.
[248:01.84]You guys always have a fun idea, like, 9% of the time.
[248:04.54]Let's see what we got.
[248:11.56]You ready for a lesson in warfare?
[248:13.86]Level 10.
[248:14.30]I'm getting thirsty over here.
[248:18.20]A level 10 versus a level 18 with two dogs.
[248:22.92]He's gonna get eaten instantly.
[248:26.12]This is just a random guy in the stands.
[248:28.56]This is not even a captain.
[248:33.24]How unfair is this?
[248:42.45]This is... That's just not fucking fair.
[248:49.32]And he's gonna gain levels from this.
[248:55.98]If we spam chat with a hundred messages, at least eight of them will be funny.
[249:01.61]Well, I have two warchiefs now.
[249:03.57]Let's go do the tutorial in heavy air quotes siege.
[249:10.61]Let's do it.
[249:15.83]Let's go cause a problem.
[249:17.55]I'm just locking myself in a cage.
[249:24.69]Great work, Jeremy.
[249:30.02]I got any fast travel?
[249:32.30]Just get up here.
[249:40.92]And... Gotcha!
[249:54.61]This is what we do, we make noises as we run.
[250:03.99]Fill the dead air.
[250:05.53]Climb onto the crane.
[250:07.68]They're doing construction.
[250:08.64]Sign a bodyguard?
[250:09.44]Yeah, I'll take a bodyguard in there too.
[250:25.18]Here we go!
[250:27.08]Alright, bodyguard.
[250:36.90]I can't make you a bodyguard.
[250:38.92]I can do... Make my bodyguard, this guy.
[250:42.67]The guy with the flashbang.
[250:43.87]Let's put a skill point in.
[250:51.81]And then we'll start the raid.
[250:58.83]Make my video.
[251:03.25]Ranged.
[251:04.09]Bird of Praise is where you can be in the air and shoot.
[251:06.97]That's cool.
[251:12.74]Might as well, right?
[251:17.20]Start the Siege of Orgrimmar.
[251:20.48]Patch 6.1.
[251:21.00]Stupid assholes.
[251:24.18]Are you serious?
[251:27.50]Alright.
[251:27.66]I want to bring... I would like to bring, alongside you... We already got Binkus up there.
[251:31.04]He's already kind of with me.
[251:33.00]Dead man.
[251:33.70]And we'll keep this.
[251:55.27]Sounds good to me.
[251:56.87]18, 18, 18, 19.
[251:56.95]We're good.
[251:58.07]Let's win.
[252:02.82]Start the siege.
[252:04.80]I got an achievement for having two war chiefs in there.
[252:19.71]That's cool.
[252:24.08]I'm glad you don't have to actually recruit every single person.
[252:27.84]That would take a million years.
[252:29.10]I do have an advantage.
[252:36.02]There he is.
[252:36.54]This orc doesn't speak the fake English.
[252:53.97]Because it's not supposed to be English, right?
[252:55.27]It's supposed to be something else.
[252:56.17]Like common.
[252:56.75]It's going to be so sad when this guy dies halfway through.
[252:59.77]They're going to kill that guy eventually.
[253:01.73]And it's going to be sad.
[253:27.98]Let's get in.
[253:31.22]The Sie- The Siege.
[253:35.81]Start the Siege.
[253:39.67]Just like in the second Lord of the Rings movie, except we're the ones climbing the tower.
[253:50.89]Helm's deep.
[253:52.23]Except on the other side.
[253:53.79]It's all orcs.
[253:56.57]That's my bodyguard.
[254:00.03]Bring him out.
[254:02.41]Summon bo- There he is.
[254:06.15]Keep it up.
[254:06.93]Flashbang.
[254:11.15]Sick tutorial.
[254:16.03]Capture.
[254:18.71]Alright.
[254:19.65]Capture the point.
[254:25.32]Is that it?
[254:25.64]What?
[254:25.74]Is he turning?
[254:28.26]No.
[254:28.38]Did I just win?
[254:28.82]No.
[254:28.94]Alright, we're going to capture this now.
[254:54.21]That'd be so funny if he just turned when there's, like, a hundred versus one.
[255:00.29]Oh, what a good day for a sabotage.
[255:02.53]What's that?
[255:03.01]There's 400 of ya.
[255:05.73]Oh.
[255:06.49]Well, I was just kidding.
[255:13.52]And... Karagor!
[255:21.71]I can see that this is very cool.
[255:27.09]Infiltrating the captains, and... You know, you could just go in without doing any of this, right?
[255:31.92]But it'd be five times harder.
[255:37.54]Still fun.
[255:40.12]Regardless of the process.
[255:46.99]And... There he is again.
[255:49.34]You guys are too late!
[256:04.42]What?
[256:04.97]What are you talking about?
[256:26.60]This strategy, it doesn't work.
[256:28.96]Oh my god, I'm so scared.
[256:30.66]We just, without any fucking resistance, took over the entire capital.
[256:35.60]This is too much for me.
[256:37.02]He's too scary.
[256:39.36]This strategy doesn't work.
[256:41.25]The foolproof strategy doesn't work.
[256:47.31]Wow, I'm getting rid of that guy.
[256:55.76]We had absolute zero resistance, and the real Donatello is here, by the way.
[257:01.07]Been making Ninja Turtle jokes with these guys.
[257:02.67]This actually is Michael Bay presents Donatello.
[257:05.19]He even has the thing on his eyes.
[257:09.53]Oh, wait, no.
[257:14.12]There's a guy.
[257:14.76]There's a goblin on his shoulder.
[257:24.04]I thought I recognized that voice.
[257:26.21]What?
[257:27.13]Rat bag?
[257:28.85]So much to catch up on.
[257:30.17]Where do I start?
[257:31.51]How about your death?
[257:34.33]What?
[257:34.87]You mean get hit by the hammer?
[257:35.91]There's a headache at most.
[257:38.57]I mean, you want to kill a new rook, you got to take the head clean off.
[257:41.63]Does the job every time.
[257:43.05]Well, most of the time, I think.
[257:44.56]I don't know.
[257:45.22]Never really been sure about that.
[257:46.74]Oh, I'm quite sure it's all the time.
[257:49.76]Allow me to damage that.
[257:51.62]Wait.
[257:52.76]Rose.
[257:54.96]How did you end up here I was thinking was gonna be a boss fight by such a funny cutscene and all slavers to what cannibals woman's a necromancer fun bunch They captured this old log.
[258:16.83]Oh, he was in rough shape.
[258:18.59]We were cage mates until I sprung the Saturday
[258:22.60]Old log jumps out, arms go a-flyin', and then here we are, the best of friends.
[258:30.71]We are not friends.
[258:33.77]Oh, right.
[258:34.67]I should tell him about the fourth thing.
[258:35.79]Thank you for that.
[258:36.97]It's kind of a long story.
[258:39.15]Ranger killed the old overlord.
[258:40.55]Now it's ours.
[258:43.35]Ranger?
[258:44.33]Oh, yeah.
[258:45.17]I named him after you.
[258:46.78]I'm on it.
[258:48.02]Well, it's been nice catching up in Ormby.
[258:50.98]Right Lord and me just came by to tell you that the fort's ours now.
[258:55.39]Right Lord?
[258:56.71]Well, you are welcome to it, Right Lord.
[258:59.35]Me and Ranger are done with the Overlord game.
[259:01.31]It's a right pain.
[259:02.57]We're gonna feed your followers, train your followers, make sure you don't get killed by your followers.
[259:08.62]Yeah, it's a right bother.
[259:11.72]Well, your worries are over, because now I'm over it all.
[259:15.56]Mm-hmm.
[259:17.38]No.
[259:18.12]Uh-uh.
[259:18.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[259:19.44]Not you.
[259:20.24]Anybody but you.
[259:22.36]Invite him.
[259:22.76]Whatever you need, Ranger.
[259:24.26]Me and Ranger have got you covered.
[259:26.62]Wait, Ranger, Ranger.
[259:27.84]It's a little confusing, isn't it?
[259:29.18]But the point is, bruise cannot be overlooked.
[259:31.62]Are we going to have to see a fight here?
[259:33.78]Is it going to be bruise versus?
[259:34.96]I have to make a decision?
[259:37.18]I've got to make a choice here.
[259:38.78]I'm in your mind, idiot.
[259:40.16]No.
[259:40.36]Look, I'm not going to mod Ratbag.
[260:03.21]Ratback was in the last game and he was like funny in the last game.
[260:05.86]It's time for new blood.
[260:06.82]It's time for a modern Bruce.
[260:14.21]We fought and suffered, but still we stand.
[260:19.29]There is a new power in Mordor.
[260:21.99]You!
[260:23.74]In the days ahead, we will fight other battles and claim other fortresses.
[260:29.94]But starting today, Mordor belongs to you!
[260:35.02]Mordor belongs to the Bright Lord!
[260:41.74]Am I going to get the title screen?
[260:47.16]Fortress captured.
[260:48.08]Overlord defeated.
[260:49.99]Why am I talking about these orcs?
[260:55.99]Mordor belongs to you!
[260:58.47]You savage fucking murderers!
[261:03.24]Conquered Nernin.
[261:05.56]Promote to Overlord.
[261:09.93]I can't.
[261:10.45]What?
[261:11.83]Oh, shit.
[261:12.57]I can't promote him to Overlord.
[261:14.86]It can't be Ratbag either.
[261:17.12]Alright, this is a tough decision.
[261:24.94]Gash.
[261:26.22]Rash.
[261:29.72]I think it could be a pretty good Overlord.
[261:32.52]Skin Peeler, the guy, the bull.
[261:37.01]The sadistic aura.
[261:38.29]How about this little shit?
[261:43.87]Where's the guy that ran away?
[261:44.85]The guy that ran away?
[261:51.09]It's gotta have to be Fink.
[261:52.95]It's Fink.
[261:55.97]I've made my decision.
[262:00.03]Rash, good Fink.
[262:01.99]You are the official overlord.
[262:07.64]Fink 2017.
[262:08.08]The guy that ran for comedy gold.
[262:17.23]He's a berserker.
[262:18.31]I think he'll do okay.
[262:19.63]It's gonna be Fink.
[262:22.95]You now own this place.
[262:29.51]Warcheeks promoted.
[262:33.41]I run the show now.
[262:38.13]Now we have a foothold in Mordor.
[262:40.25]Conquest is now available.
[262:41.13]We should upgrade our defenses before Sauron attempts to reclaim what he has lost.
[262:45.31]Upgrade defenses?
[262:46.13]And there are more fortresses to conquer.
[262:47.57]Oh, man.
[262:48.01]And the Palantir is back in Minas Morgo.
[262:51.15]We must choose our next move carefully.
[262:53.29]Oh, I have my fortress.
[262:55.71]Ay-yi-yi.
[262:58.54]So you have to upgrade your defense.
[263:03.90]Siege upgrades.
[263:05.56]Reach a map.
[263:06.04]Like, do I have, like, how do I, um...
[263:09.47]Command.
[263:13.13]Alright, so is this one of those situations where you never take the goalie out from where he's supposed to be?
[263:21.64]Is me having Fink attack this guy the equivalent of bringing your goalie out in soccer?
[263:27.05]Like just running out to play with the other guys?
[263:37.11]oh well training orders grants a follower a curse weapon upgrades his follower to epic first training should I just should I make this guy epic it's like using your queen and your your it's like using your king to go out in the middle of the board
[264:02.26]Yeah, I think my first move game of chess is I'm gonna move Pawn E out and King forward.
[264:10.83]Yeah, we're gonna have an epic Fink.
[264:18.44]Fink is now epic.
[264:20.90]Go get him, Fink.
[264:29.57]Okay.
[264:30.33]Quests available in Nirnin.
[264:32.24]Let's just look at my inventory.
[264:37.10]Delete.
[264:38.64]Delete.
[264:41.94]Delete it.
[264:43.84]Delete it.
[264:45.02]Upgrade.
[264:49.27]Mm-hmm.
[264:50.23]Headshots will freeze an enemy 33%.
[264:52.35]Charge shots pierce through enemies.
[264:56.87]Very nice.
[265:08.42]That's a lot.
[265:08.98]I got to pee again.
[265:09.78]I'll be right back.
[265:12.02]One more pee, and we'll get back to it.
[265:14.23]Be right back.
[265:14.95]Excuse me.
[268:13.68]Hey.
[268:16.08]Umbach.
[268:16.40]Hey there.
[268:22.01]How you doing?
[268:22.47]Umbach.
[268:24.97]Returned.
[268:27.73]Okay.
[268:28.73]Let's continue to play.
[268:31.67]Probably like another hour or two.
[268:35.37]Maybe.
[268:36.33]We'll see how we do.
[268:37.37]See how it goes.
[268:40.70]We are getting later into the night.
[268:42.86]It is getting to be, like, around midnight.
[268:45.52]So, maybe, like, another hour or so.
[268:47.29]I don't want to stay up too, too late.
[268:48.43]I want to keep you guys up.
[268:52.51]Before we go, thank you to Darkstar.
[268:55.89]Oh, that's some good thinking.
[268:58.71]Thanks for the bits, dude.
[268:59.43]Thank you to, uh, EXE Hazmat for the bits.
[269:02.50]Pin for the bits.
[269:04.14]Hey, Jerm, I've been doing some wicked late hours working a job I hate.
[269:07.59]Just wanted to say I'm listening to you and Bill Burr makes it all bearable.
[269:12.51]Listening to me and Bill Burr make it bearable.
[269:14.23]Bill Burr is a fucking legendary comedian, so... To even be mentioned in the same sentence as Bill Burr, like that you're watching both of us.
[269:24.98]That's a fucking honorable... That's like sitting next to Jesus.
[269:29.12]Like I'm at the dinner table and Jesus...
[269:32.11]Christ is next to me.
[269:34.23]And I'm just like, I'm sitting there like, holy shit.
[269:36.28]I'm like, God is in the room.
[269:41.42]Anywho, thanks, man.
[269:44.58]Didn't want to miss anybody else.
[269:46.36]Miosar, thanks for the $4.
[269:48.82]Kappa 400.
[269:49.66]Well, thank you.
[269:52.83]Actually, $5.
[269:53.73]They say Kappa 100, too.
[269:56.67]Skidmark.
[269:58.85]Skiz.
[269:59.77]Thanks for the $5.
[270:00.13]Thanks for the $5.
[270:01.72]Is this the same guy who beat Cuphead on stream in a short amount of time?
[270:05.27]It is.
[270:06.93]And thank you for saying that.
[270:08.93]Thank you for noticing.
[270:10.81]Thank you for noticing me.
[270:13.01]Thanks, kid.
[270:15.45]W, thank you, W, for the $5.
[270:16.41]Hey, Gerber, just wanted to say I love the content, and did you know that the Echidna has two penises?
[270:25.88]I didn't know that.
[270:27.74]You just enlightened all of us, and it was very, very lewd.
[270:32.22]And... At least it was informational.
[270:37.80]Sir Feline, thanks for the $5.
[270:39.00]Well, they've really changed the Cursed Crusade since you last played it, Jerma, huh?
[270:42.84]When did they change Denz's name to Talion?
[270:45.29]You guys love that, huh?
[270:46.07]You guys love the Denz thing.
[270:48.95]That game was so bad, but so good at the same time.
[270:55.83]Uh, thank you... I'm gonna butcher this name.
[271:02.16]No.
[271:04.96]Not a live girl.
[271:08.52]Not a live gull.
[271:13.34]Not till live... I have no idea what this is.
[271:19.08]Thanks for the $5.
[271:19.58]It's just this cheer 500.
[271:23.83]Virgil.
[271:24.61]Thank you, Virgil.
[271:25.33]I'm going to call you Virgil.
[271:27.29]For the $5.
[271:27.89]And King of Whales...
[271:29.60]For the three dollars.
[271:30.44]I like how Chad has agreed with him.
[271:31.60]I already got it.
[271:32.44]Thanks for it, though.
[271:34.04]And Darkstar, thank you.
[271:35.51]Let's go.
[271:35.81]Let's play the video game.
[271:37.67]What do you say?
[271:44.41]Alright.
[271:45.07]I'm gonna put... I'm gonna take off the legendary.
[271:46.77]Because I get +2 stealth.
[271:51.05]That seems kind of like a big deal.
[271:53.37]Even though the whole beast thing is actually... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[271:56.22]Maximum focus.
[272:03.11]Okay, well, let's destroy this one.
[272:05.67]I can't take off the new ring.
[272:08.41]In what world is the Lord of the Rings the new ring worse than this random rune of leaves?
[272:17.22]That should be the legendary, man.
[272:20.24]Okay, on with the show.
[272:22.06]On with it.
[272:22.62]Get on with it.
[272:26.38]And let's do... Let's get a new quest here.
[272:32.91]what's there to do gear and skills alright set waypoint conquest it's just right in front of me apparently conquest the fortress of shock birds is in Norman is yours yet this is only the first battle of the war more for
[273:02.81]Almost forgot to tell you one last thing.
[273:05.45]Now that you have my fort, it will eventually come under attack, which you already know since you attacked it once yourself.
[273:12.07]Nicely done, by the way.
[273:14.09]The thing is, you don't always need to be on the defense.
[273:17.87]You have scouts who can sniff out enemy forts so you can go on the attack yourself.
[273:23.08]You know what they say, the best offense is a good offense.
[273:27.76]And don't worry about running low on orcs.
[273:30.25]If you ever need new recruits, you go talk to a glob they call the Headhunter.
[273:35.33]He'll sort you out.
[273:37.67]Oh, Shrark.
[273:39.73]Online Conquest.
[273:40.19]Oh, it really is Clash of Clans.
[273:41.33]It really is Clash of Clans.
[273:43.25]That was a joke!
[273:43.63]Did you hear that disgusting noise that my throat just made?
[274:02.94]That was like a worm was inside of my stomach trying to get up.
[274:08.32]If you heard that, I apologize.
[274:09.78]Now that you control a fortress, you can launch attacks against other players.
[274:16.84]Start an online conquest mission to find a player to attack.
[274:19.84]If you succeed, you can improve your rank and earn rewards.
[274:24.67]Be sure to bolster your own defenses.
[274:26.53]Powerful warchiefs and siege upgrades will strengthen your fortress.
[274:29.23]Other players can't affect your orcs in your fortress in your game.
[274:33.20]But defending well against their attacks can improve your rank.
[274:39.12]Well.
[274:41.66]Let's do it.
[274:46.42]Okay, Greg.
[274:51.72]How do I...
[274:54.86]How do I do this?
[274:58.52]Participate in online activities to attract your interactions with others.
[275:01.86]How do I do an... I want to go online and fight.
[275:11.05]How do I actually do this?
[275:16.43]Greg?
[275:16.87]Yeah, that's... Is it a new map mission?
[275:25.14]The fight pits.
[275:29.40]Um, how do I do it?
[275:31.64]The features inside of a loot crate.
[275:33.28]Alright, online conquest.
[275:37.13]I'm gonna go try it.
[275:39.05]Let's go raid somebody's gold mines.
[275:42.15]Let's try to get as many points as we can.
[275:51.70]Everybody seems to be adding features like this lately.
[275:59.07]And you know here's the thing Yes, like the whole loot boxes and online shit like they look here's what they're trying to do I'm gonna tell you what they're trying to do.
[276:10.63]I don't know if they're gonna succeed, but here's what they're gonna do.
[276:12.67]I
[276:14.52]They want this to be like Hitman, you know what I mean?
[276:18.95]It's a single player game, but there's all these constant online interactions and you have to go and get a contract!
[276:28.50]Like, you don't have to play any of the multiplayer shit.
[276:31.70]Any of the online shit.
[276:32.62]You don't need to open any boxes, technically.
[276:35.70]They're trying to do that, like, drip-feed content where for the next, like, two years, people will want to still be playing Shadow of War just because of, like, the points and the rating and the other stuff that has really nothing to do with the actual video game Shadow of War.
[276:55.64]And everyone's been doing that lately.
[276:57.76]Do I agree with it?
[277:00.18]No, not at all.
[277:02.69]But every like $60 game now is trying to have that drip feed content thing where it's like, you know, you beat the game in like 30 or 40 hours, but you play it for three years because you want to protect that.
[277:14.82]And that has your name on it, right?
[277:16.14]It says Greg right through that hoop.
[277:18.92]It's lit up in LEDs and it's yours.
[277:21.40]Don't you want to cherish that for three years until Shadow of War 3 comes out?
[277:27.06]Shadow of Gondor?
[277:29.68]That's the whole purpose.
[277:32.32]Alright.
[277:32.66]Ranked Conquest.
[277:38.02]Okay.
[277:38.50]How about this one?
[277:39.06]Defense rating 61.
[277:40.98]This is an easy win.
[277:47.50]Easy win.
[277:47.96]We're going to take... What are we going to take with us?
[277:53.52]We're going to take this guy.
[277:54.26]We're going to take the Terror.
[277:59.08]Let's this time go with...
[278:03.08]This poor guy.
[278:03.88]This poor guy.
[278:05.45]Let's get some Karagors.
[278:07.07]No.
[278:09.07]Explosive people.
[278:11.05]And who else do I have?
[278:12.41]Well, this is the guy that ran away last time.
[278:13.73]So who cares if he loses?
[278:16.52]And savages.
[278:17.10]72 versus 61.
[278:23.32]This is an easy win.
[278:24.13]Let's get it.
[278:31.31]If a follower dies in ranked, they die.
[278:39.34]They do it so they don't have to fill a single-player game with real content.
[278:42.28]It's cheap and easy.
[278:43.10]All multiplayer is.
[278:44.55]Look at the love and care Breath of the Wild got.
[278:46.39]It's incredible.
[278:46.93]AAA companies don't want to sink resources into that kind of game because it doesn't make as much money.
[278:54.03]Yeah, but Breath of the Wild... Honestly, I mean, thank you, by the way, Chroma, for the two bucks, but...
[279:01.14]I don't think you can make the comparison to, like, Breath of the Wild, considering Breath of the Wild took, like, like, nine years for them to make it.
[279:08.98]Shadow of Mordor came out, like, just about three years ago.
[279:12.57]You know, they, like, went right into making this game, too.
[279:14.75]And yes, it's a cheesy, cheap shit way to, like, have fake longevity for your game.
[279:19.28]I agree.
[279:23.99]Breath of the Wild took like a... Breath of the Wild took like a decade to make, didn't it?
[279:27.47]Because wasn't it supposed to be on the Wii U?
[279:29.63]I thought that game was supposed to be like a Wii U launch title or something, right?
[279:35.55]But even still, I mean, this game took a huge amount of time to make, too.
[279:38.98]And they took them like three years to make it.
[279:43.30]Like six?
[279:46.80]Let's see.
[279:48.60]You've entered another player's Mordor.
[279:50.08]Plan your attack to defeat their Overlord and capture the fortress.
[279:52.32]Quicker victories will earn you more shield stuff.
[279:56.14]Spoils of war and improve your assault rating.
[279:58.38]During online conquests, you can recruit any captain for the duration of the conquest, but only the followers you brought with you will return to Mordor.
[280:06.63]You got it.
[280:12.29]Do I have a... I think I have a bodyguard.
[280:16.18]I've only got six minutes.
[280:18.58]Six minutes.
[280:19.18]We're going to make this happen.
[280:23.02]Alright, Og.
[280:25.60]Another Og.
[280:28.50]Hello, Og.
[280:29.18]At least we have a new nemesis here.
[280:39.70]Gotta get rid of this dude.
[280:41.06]He's only level 12.
[280:42.94]Shouldn't be a problem.
[280:47.24]In fact, you know what?
[280:48.38]Fuck it.
[280:51.38]I'm taking his guys.
[280:55.30]You are now mine.
[280:56.32]Stay and fight.
[280:57.08]Because I don't care if you die, because you're not my guy.
[281:10.07]Uh, my Caradour is here already, so that's good.
[281:14.72]And... No, no, no, no, come on.
[281:17.24]Oh, you actually just have to stand in a circle now.
[281:20.16]It's not just like, capture.
[281:26.50]Wow, that was a fucking acrobatic move.
[281:34.08]Next!
[281:40.29]I'll get the gold.
[281:43.03]Going for gold.
[281:45.25]He doesn't seem to have any... Does he have only, like, one captain?
[281:49.57]No, he's... Look at this.
[281:50.43]Oh, there's a shitload of people here.
[281:51.75]I need to wait.
[281:52.57]I need to wait for my, like, guys.
[281:59.67]Come on, move along.
[282:00.61]Let's do it.
[282:04.03]I can hurt my own guys, I think.
[282:07.08]There are a lot of people this way.
[282:08.34]I don't know.
[282:12.04]Alright.
[282:12.36]Let's go.
[282:13.51]Siege.
[282:13.93]Dupe people.
[282:16.03]Alright.
[282:39.32]I could just poison the Grog.
[282:41.98]Start poisoning now.
[282:44.78]Finally.
[282:45.04]Here come my captains.
[282:45.74]This is good.
[282:52.95]Poison!
[282:54.79]Come on!
[282:55.19]Get in here!
[282:57.03]Attack!
[283:02.10]It's hard to tell who's who!
[283:06.93]Too many people.
[283:08.57]Too many Karagors.
[283:09.53]This fucking one guy just keeps doing this spamming dive move over and over again.
[283:17.94]Fuck off.
[283:20.94]Come on, give me that.
[283:25.74]Give me that Karagor.
[283:27.44]That ain't gonna work.
[283:35.29]Ayayay.
[283:37.15]Oh my god, will you fucking please?
[283:39.59]Jesus!
[283:40.79]Jesus Christ!
[283:46.52]Oh my god, this guy will not stop.
[283:50.16]He keeps doing the same fucking move.
[283:52.80]He's unstoppable.
[283:54.64]Somebody fucking stunlock that guy.
[284:01.53]Uh-oh.
[284:02.71]My guy's 21.
[284:04.31]He killed his own guy.
[284:05.23]That's fine.
[284:05.55]That wasn't my guy.
[284:06.43]That wasn't a guy I brought.
[284:07.49]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[284:25.69]I will take you.
[284:29.11]Recruit.
[284:30.49]And fight.
[284:36.29]Stay and fight.
[284:36.99]Let's do it.
[284:38.41]Can I capture this now?
[284:40.68]No, I'm tired.
[284:42.70]Does he know he has a bow yet?
[284:44.46]Can't go forward.
[284:45.00]I have to...
[284:59.42]Alright, get the fucking Karagors out of here.
[285:04.39]Just a shitload of dogs everywhere, just sprinting in every direction.
[285:11.47]I want him.
[285:12.31]Is he running?
[285:13.43]Well, they're all coming with me.
[285:16.75]This guy's 21.
[285:36.55]Too powerful to recruit.
[285:39.03]I forgot a gem.
[285:44.70]Is there a gem lying down there somewhere?
[285:50.02]Alright.
[285:50.66]Let's bring it in.
[285:52.42]Bring it in, boys.
[285:58.37]This guy's gonna wake up and go back to his fort and notice that these guys have been leveled down.
[286:04.17]He's gonna have no idea what's going on.
[286:06.60]He's gonna be like, what the fuck?
[286:07.44]This game sucks, dude.
[286:08.50]Like, what the fuck?
[286:09.14]I lost like two hours of content.
[286:13.30]Took so much time.
[286:16.60]I think something's wrong with my save file.
[286:18.20]That guy's gonna be on the Reddit.
[286:20.02]Something's going on with my save file, guys.
[286:21.48]Like, my guys keep getting demoted for some reason.
[286:23.58]It doesn't have any effect.
[286:25.40]Yeah, well.
[286:39.27]Fire weapon.
[286:42.37]The defending player doesn't lose anything.
[286:45.63]That's cool.
[286:47.73]Nobody get in here.
[286:51.57]Do I have to, like, one-on-one fight this guy?
[286:54.69]Apparently.
[286:58.51]No, I want to mount the horse.
[287:09.52]Keep it up.
[287:10.06]Oh, he's on fire.
[287:10.76]Oh no, there's actual boss mechanics in here.
[287:18.69]At least they can get hit by their own shit.
[287:20.41]Eat him!
[287:31.90]My orcs can die permanently.
[287:35.20]Oh, I gotta kill this guy in like two minutes.
[287:42.84]This ain't working the way that I want it to, so... Immune to execution.
[287:57.37]Oh, that sucks.
[287:58.87]That really sucks.
[288:01.61]What about arrows?
[288:04.37]Not immune to arrows!
[288:05.87]I got him!
[288:35.31]And... Recruit!
[288:41.74]That would be so terrible if you actually lost everything.
[288:50.70]Shame him?
[288:52.02]No, I want to take that guy.
[288:53.00]That guy was pretty good.
[288:58.90]So what, you just... It's...
[289:04.76]They made this game before.
[289:05.88]It was an action RPG.
[289:06.74]I made a video on it.
[289:08.44]The video sucks, so don't worry.
[289:09.60]Don't go watch it.
[289:12.20]It had a really, really, really fucking awful name.
[289:15.94]What was the name of the game where you make the base with the defenses and you have to have people there and you have captains and stuff?
[289:24.08]It was like The Mighty Epic Quester for Fun Looters.
[289:27.58]What a terrible fucking shit name for a game, by the way.
[289:31.53]The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot.
[289:38.03]Right?
[289:40.49]The game tanked completely.
[289:41.89]It's a total failure of a game.
[289:46.99]Maybe if they didn't name the game a series of adjectives to describe the game, it maybe would have been better.
[289:55.24]Successfully capturing another place fortress rewards you with spoils of war, improving rating, and a conquest loot chest.
[290:01.62]You have your current rank in each region.
[290:06.27]And also, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[290:08.36]My lord.
[290:08.92]Uh, let's go here.
[290:19.24]No.
[290:20.86]Two different pause menus just confuse me forever.
[290:24.17]Let's open our chest.
[290:34.89]Five things.
[290:36.85]Jesus.
[290:42.32]Is every single one of these an upgrade?
[290:44.40]No.
[290:45.14]It's all level 10 shit.
[290:47.96]What am I going to do?
[290:48.48]A cooking stream?
[290:51.32]I can't really cook.
[290:52.02]I don't really make very much.
[290:53.46]This thing sucks.
[291:03.96]So it was this.
[291:10.71]Hey, Yakusai, thank you for the five bucks.
[291:12.65]Hey, Jerma, I love your content and how fucking weird I am.
[291:15.51]My friend Tony enjoyed your streams too.
[291:16.97]I mentioned him because he passed away this week from medical complications.
[291:21.54]Here's some bucks.
[291:25.54]Though I'm tight on money right now.
[291:26.82]I've known him for seven years, so it's been tough, but thanks for helping cheer me up.
[291:30.98]And thanks for making him laugh.
[291:34.18]Damn.
[291:36.46]Well...
[291:38.38]First of all, thank you for the $5, dude.
[291:42.12]That's, um... I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[291:48.72]And if I was somehow, like, something you both enjoyed, you know, if you enjoyed watching me, if I could even help at all, then, you know, that's a huge thing to hear.
[292:04.56]I wish you the best, man.
[292:05.50]I really do.
[292:07.75]Keep your memories.
[292:08.51]Remember the good times, man.
[292:10.85]For sure.
[292:11.15]Yeah.
[292:20.15]Just taking a second after that one.
[292:21.57]Because that's... You know, hearing stuff like that is always... You know, it's conflicting, right?
[292:29.26]Because obviously that's a terrible thing for your friend to pass away.
[292:35.56]But...
[292:37.66]Just knowing that somehow you guys both watched me and shit.
[292:42.69]I'm just glad that if I could be in it, like I said, if any help or fun for you guys over the years, then that's a fucking huge deal to me.
[292:53.89]So thank you for that message.
[292:55.56]And I wish you the best.
[293:08.97]You make the daily grind easier.
[293:10.77]Well, you guys make the daily grind easier for me.
[293:14.61]You know, that's the truth.
[293:19.36]Jumping on and just fucking around and having fun on these streams is like therapy to me.
[293:25.66]I can come on, I can just fuck around, we can talk, we can talk shit about stuff.
[293:29.60]It's as much helping me as it is helping you guys too, if that's the case for you guys.
[293:37.32]As long as we can laugh about it a little bit, you know?
[293:39.96]All of us.
[293:41.26]That makes me happy.
[293:45.88]Anywho.
[293:47.62]I agree.
[293:58.43]Explains why I'm so nuts in these streams.
[294:01.99]I'm just fucking around, you know what I mean?
[294:05.10]Like I said, 95% of everything I say when I stream is just fucking around, having fun, making dumb jokes and stuff.
[294:10.98]We're just having fun.
[294:15.34]At least I hope you are.
[294:17.52]Because that's what I try to do.
[294:18.58]I try to come out and just have fun.
[294:21.78]But I can upgrade something here.
[294:23.86]What am I currently wearing?
[294:24.95]I'm wearing this.
[294:26.43]Alright, let's upgrade.
[294:28.69]It's 15 cents.
[294:31.93]None of these are worth putting on.
[294:34.02]This one's worth destroying though, that's for sure.
[294:36.04]73% damage.
[294:39.14]That's a lot of poison reduction.
[294:50.33]I've tried to explain this before, but anytime...
[294:55.15]Like, I get a lot of really uplifting messages from people.
[294:59.50]And really, really deep stories of what people, you know, stuff that they're going through.
[295:04.24]Or, you know, just anything.
[295:05.96]Like, hearing all the stories.
[295:09.69]That's why I keep doing, you know, I could have just stopped probably streaming or doing YouTube or anything.
[295:15.07]Like, years ago when I was like, I don't know, maybe I don't want to.
[295:19.86]But, like, it's always just been fun for me.
[295:21.94]It's always been about, like, having fun and just fucking around and trying to make, like, fun videos, fun streams.
[295:27.85]If I wasn't, like, having fun, I probably wouldn't be doing it.
[295:31.33]And you guys make it fun.
[295:33.49]That's why I still do it.
[295:36.05]And there's a fucking fight out my front door again.
[295:38.53]Why would... Wait, we're inside of my keep, aren't we?
[295:43.60]I want them both.
[295:44.48]These are mine now, daddy.
[295:47.82]The winner gets to be my friend.
[295:50.40]There.
[295:51.38]Which one did I dominate?
[295:52.82]What the hell is going on?
[295:58.13]Alright, let's go.
[296:02.73]Let's go do a quest.
[296:04.57]A new quest.
[296:07.89]This one.
[296:12.19]I'm gonna bring my new mech warrior and we're gonna go that way.
[296:22.28]So we get to go watch- we're gonna go watch a fighting pit?
[296:27.96]Something tells me this is not fair to go to the fighting pits with this guy.
[296:35.80]Can't walk up the stairs.
[296:37.28]You're too big!
[296:40.38]Why am I even- this is the worst-
[296:43.12]Slowest possible route to go there is to use a garage to climb walls Alright, there you go good jumps Which way am I going this way?
[297:07.84]Nice jump
[297:09.99]Oh, come on.
[297:10.95]You can do that.
[297:12.41]Don't even give me that shit.
[297:14.05]Oh, my goodness.
[297:20.47]Get... Get over there.
[297:24.88]I don't want to leave him.
[297:25.88]I want to keep this guy.
[297:26.94]I want to watch on my elephant.
[297:36.89]Here we are.
[297:41.93]Alright, well, it was absolutely useless to bring you along.
[297:47.64]Entry Fortress has a training... Every Fortress has a training ground, but there's nowhere better for an orc to hone his skills than the Fight Pits.
[297:53.60]And there's no one who knows more about the Fight Pits than Master Wang.
[297:59.57]Just pit them against each other?
[298:16.37]I didn't hear anything he just said.
[298:17.93]I was looking over here and I heard That's it Who do I have to stake in here?
[298:51.43]So I guess that was... Level 4.
[298:55.11]This guy really is a coward.
[298:57.61]That's the guy that ran.
[298:58.79]He just went up against... He went up against like a child.
[299:01.39]Did he talk about like ages?
[299:05.25]That was a 20 year old versus a 4 year old.
[299:07.35]What the hell was that?
[299:08.73]Damn.
[299:16.98]Skill point gained.
[299:19.76]More information.
[299:20.62]More stuff.
[299:23.21]Now that you control the region, you can send your followers to fight in the pits.
[299:25.87]Followers who survive increase their level, but remember, it can never exceed your own.
[299:31.35]To send a follower to fight an enemy orc, go to the Fight Pits mission start point.
[299:36.85]Each region has three fights of increasing difficulty, with a victory in one unlocking the next.
[299:41.41]Victory in all three unlocks the Citadel upgrade for the region's fortress.
[299:46.67]You can also make two followers fight each other by commanding them from the army menu.
[299:50.56]This creates a Fight Pits follower mission.
[300:01.34]New region unlocked.
[300:02.18]New region unlocked.
[300:03.72]Oh, dear.
[300:09.54]Okay.
[300:13.62]Lord.
[300:16.53]This map is fucking huge!
[300:20.47]The first game had two zones.
[300:22.27]This place has, like, five.
[300:25.97]Jesus.
[300:26.43]Alright, well, let's keep going.
[300:33.60]Now that you can travel through Mordor, you've also unlocked challenges, complete challenges, to sharpen your skills.
[300:37.98]I remember these from the first game.
[300:42.23]Yeah.
[300:43.17]Daily challenge.
[300:44.65]Yeah, daily challenges.
[300:52.47]Shootin' Uruk's leg.
[300:54.98]What are you guys doing?
[300:57.62]What?
[300:58.30]This guy just walked in?
[301:04.42]It's like 30 people versus one guy.
[301:06.68]How is this fair?
[301:16.13]He's trying to run away.
[301:17.51]He's coming to get me.
[301:21.47]Now get back in there, you fucking lively bastard.
[301:27.69]No, he's dead.
[301:31.29]Well, we're here.
[301:31.95]We might as well do this.
[301:36.21]It's called the Fight Pits for a reason.
[301:39.21]Send your follower into the Fight Pits to win power and glory.
[301:42.07]If he survives, one time reward, one skill point.
[301:47.33]Alright, well, let's put this guy back in.
[301:54.69]Who's he taking on?
[301:56.67]Oh, shit.
[301:59.76]I'm just getting warmed up here.
[302:02.17]Well, here's the real test.
[302:04.51]Does the coward win?
[302:08.60]Why does he get all these people?
[302:13.50]He gets three dudes.
[302:15.72]Four dudes!
[302:18.04]You have four people with you.
[302:21.28]The ultimate coward.
[302:27.02]He's getting his ass kicked.
[302:33.82]He's gonna lose.
[302:37.24]Get him!
[302:39.38]Oh god, well, we lo- we lose this guy.
[302:44.44]Swarm him!
[302:45.46]Swarm him!
[302:50.78]Well... Bye.
[302:56.67]I gained two skill points.
[302:59.97]Is he dead?
[303:08.42]Oh shit, he's dead.
[303:18.12]How come he gets... Beat this guy.
[303:23.34]Don't let the same thing happen to you.
[303:26.40]That guy's not epic or anything.
[303:29.44]Of course I could put the guy with the fucking crossbow in here.
[303:36.99]shoot him shoot him nice trap good trap good trap excellent work back it up and take a couple shots on him stop going in for melee that's not your specialty what are you doing he's just like swinging wildly back up what are you thinking oh my god he's gonna die
[304:09.35]He's shooting up into the crowd.
[304:18.20]What are you doing?
[304:19.80]He's just... My stomach.
[304:37.55]Ah.
[304:48.62]Wait a minute.
[304:49.18]That's the guy that just won.
[304:55.12]He's mine now.
[305:08.26]What?
[305:11.50]Now he's mine.
[305:12.76]We now recruit him.
[305:15.61]And then now he goes into the fighting pit.
[305:20.27]Oh, this guy's ugly.
[305:22.80]Alright.
[305:23.82]Come in.
[305:24.66]No, no, no.
[305:25.28]Go back to the base.
[305:25.84]We'll just get a couple of health potions in.
[305:28.04]Alright, now let's go have him fight.
[305:33.24]The guy that we just recruited.
[305:37.40]It's winner... Yeah, it's winner plays on.
[305:41.23]If you win, you get to keep fighting in the pits.
[305:45.58]It's an endless cycle of death.
[305:48.11]Where is he?
[305:49.19]There he is, right?
[305:50.79]Yep.
[305:51.31]Okay.
[305:57.97]What level is he?
[305:58.55]15.
[305:58.57]He got this.
[305:59.27]Alright, these guys.
[306:00.15]No followers here now.
[306:03.74]No cheating.
[306:13.17]Come on.
[306:13.59]You're two levels higher than this guy.
[306:17.67]Nice Mortal Kombat leg sweep.
[306:22.20]You should have dodged it.
[306:23.18]You should have dashed.
[306:24.34]You're taking way too much damage from a level 15.
[306:30.16]Good.
[306:30.48]Nice.
[306:31.16]Play dirty.
[306:32.76]You're an orc.
[306:34.28]Act like it.
[306:37.79]Shit.
[306:39.23]This guy has a bunch of special moves.
[306:40.69]Why don't you have any special moves?
[306:42.13]All you have is that sweep.
[306:44.43]This guy is kicking your ass because he has moves.
[306:47.05]He has a moveset, and you have right-handed swing.
[306:54.50]What is he... Well... I figured out... Alright, when it plays on...
[307:08.54]Good work.
[307:12.90]New recruit.
[307:19.16]I'm such a bad person.
[307:21.15]What?
[307:22.21]Hey, get... Alright, don't lose to this guy.
[307:28.55]I need him to fight.
[307:29.93]This guy had a lot of moves.
[307:34.07]I feel like this guy's going to be a good player for us.
[307:40.46]Right to the gut.
[307:42.44]Execution.
[307:45.40]I bring in the fucking creep.
[307:54.16]I want my dog.
[307:59.43]I just threw a knife at my fucking friend.
[308:04.75]Where's he going?
[308:05.21]Don't let him get away.
[308:08.13]This guy, why is he covered in mustard?
[308:12.02]No, wait a minute.
[308:14.84]Where did he get the honey mustard from?
[308:16.96]We're fine.
[308:21.46]Everything's fine.
[308:22.48]Don't worry about it.
[308:25.54]Oh, fucking get out of here.
[308:28.24]Oh, God.
[308:28.98]Fucking get this Karagor.
[308:40.89]Oh shit!
[308:42.21]No, wait, wait, help me, follower!
[308:44.27]He just saved my life.
[308:45.83]He actually did, lookit, lookit, he's constantly fucking flashbanging.
[308:50.29]Did you see that shit?
[308:51.45]He was constantly fucking flashbanging.
[308:54.86]That saved my entire existence.
[308:57.38]Thank God for this guy.
[309:07.30]I'm like panicking for no reason, just shooting him in the head.
[309:25.95]Can I fucking not dominate him?
[309:40.13]Hey, the winner plays on.
[309:52.47]Oh, that was perfect.
[309:56.97]When it plays on... Bow to the Bright Lord.
[310:01.95]Get... I just fell down.
[310:08.00]Okay, you did good.
[310:13.88]That was so cool.
[310:16.44]This game is fucking fun.
[310:21.45]Alright.
[310:23.42]Winner plays on.
[310:24.10]Come on.
[310:25.82]Stop the cycle.
[310:27.58]Aztharmo.
[310:30.50]Stop the cycle.
[310:33.28]I like having an investment in this guy.
[310:35.28]He's a little 15.
[310:36.12]We're done here.
[310:37.44]Beat him.
[310:38.40]Skinpeeler is like my number one guy.
[310:46.74]Flashbang doesn't work.
[310:48.76]Flashbang doesn't work on, like, the goofy guy in a Roman costume.
[310:55.57]Watch out for, like, the turkey Roman.
[311:05.09]This is like, you went back to fucking the Roman Empire, and, like, fucking Resident Evil takes place back here.
[311:10.46]It's like Nemesis.
[311:11.30]Oh my god.
[311:16.29]Resident Evil 8 takes place in the fucking 1200s.
[311:21.03]Watch out for the new fucking T-Virus.
[311:26.20]I think this is our A game player here.
[311:36.20]Winner plays on.
[311:37.09]Alright, this is it.
[311:42.03]This is the last one.
[311:45.27]This guy is such a little dickhead, he's gonna lose instantly.
[311:58.26]That's also Robert Atkin Downs.
[312:04.45]You are not... You are not gonna let this guy beat you.
[312:10.67]Oh no, he's got Karagor.
[312:12.76]Smash his head.
[312:16.59]It's an unfair fight.
[312:20.55]He's still gonna win.
[312:22.49]Now he's enraged.
[312:23.19]The dogs make him so angry.
[312:26.87]Oh, he actually is enraged by dogs.
[312:29.88]He cares more about the fucking dog.
[312:32.08]Stop fucking focusing on the dog.
[312:33.80]Who cares?
[312:37.52]Oh, you guys didn't think it.
[312:39.04]Of course he's gonna win.
[312:40.02]Get out of here, you baby mutts.
[312:45.83]He's gonna win.
[312:47.42]Although his distractions might... What is he doing here?
[312:57.91]That's his finishing move.
[312:59.39]He's done that move on everybody.
[313:00.59]That's his fucking... That's his signature.
[313:02.94]That's his attitude adjustment.
[313:15.13]This is fucking fun.
[313:16.55]When it plays on.
[313:17.83]Oh my god.
[313:19.35]This guy looks scary.
[313:24.74]That guy looks scary, though.
[313:26.10]One more.
[313:26.68]Oh no, this guy looks really scary.
[313:30.32]He has a helmet on and shit.
[313:32.02]He's 15.
[313:32.24]They all suck.
[313:32.56]Fret your bones!
[313:44.93]Why does everybody have to be such a low level against this guy?
[313:48.07]I put a level 14 in and you gave me a level 23.
[313:49.97]I mean, you just don't stand a chance.
[313:55.53]Nice overhanded swing.
[313:58.99]I do like the fact that this guy has not done one move.
[314:13.55]I don't think this guy can- this guy does not have the necessary requirements to use his weapon.
[314:18.66]All he has are flashbangs.
[314:25.34]Oh, wow, I spoke so soon.
[314:27.06]Okay, um... No more toying with this guy, please.
[314:36.68]Okay, can you please... Don't do that again.
[314:44.08]You gotta stop grabbing his sword.
[314:47.98]Oh my god, dude.
[314:50.17]You can't do that anymore.
[314:51.73]Just no more fucking around.
[314:54.67]This is it, right?
[314:55.47]Yeah, the fucking uppercut.
[314:57.95]Got it.
[315:05.97]Oh, if he had lost.
[315:11.18]He gets him with the finisher every time.
[315:16.45]Okay.
[315:34.94]Come on.
[315:38.38]Now you will taste defeat.
[315:41.09]You're bigger than him.
[315:42.53]I fight for the Dark Lord.
[315:46.48]Oh, God.
[315:49.63]Nice.
[315:50.17]Very good counter.
[315:53.33]And a double stun.
[315:54.73]Triple stun.
[315:56.03]Quadruple stun.
[315:57.53]Overhead smash.
[315:58.23]Beautiful work.
[316:01.17]Watch out for that dodge.
[316:03.06]Sorry.
[316:03.66]Nice.
[316:04.12]A stun.
[316:05.06]Excellent stun.
[316:06.02]Now get in there.
[316:08.90]That's okay.
[316:09.56]You're doing fine.
[316:10.46]You're doing just fine.
[316:11.14]Just keep up the stuns.
[316:14.95]Oh no, don't do the David and Goliath bullshit.
[316:18.60]He's stunned, dazed.
[316:19.56]Get in there.
[316:20.14]You gotta follow up.
[316:23.24]There it is.
[316:23.72]He's so... Ooh, that was a beautiful catch.
[316:31.55]He went for the finisher.
[316:32.45]He got it, but it didn't kill him.
[316:35.01]Finisher.
[316:36.01]Finish him.
[316:38.27]Stop throwing fucking snowballs at him and get in there and do your finisher.
[316:42.23]Finish him!
[316:43.69]Finish him!
[316:45.58]Finish him!
[316:47.20]No!
[316:48.48]Don't!
[317:08.55]Dammit.
[317:30.60]No!
[317:34.24]What?
[317:34.63]Hey!
[317:38.01]What happened?
[317:43.65]No!
[317:44.85]Looks like I killed you, Turk.
[317:47.11]Suppose that makes me a Turk killer.
[317:51.17]I was spamming B. I lost, like, one of my favorite guys.
[317:54.67]No, I lost.
[317:56.35]I lost one of my favorite fucking guys.
[317:59.67]God damn it.
[318:19.34]It wasn't worth it.
[318:20.39]I need to get this guy now, because he's gonna... No!
[318:25.21]I wanted to recruit that guy!
[318:29.59]Who do I have left?
[318:32.45]That's the guy I wanted to recruit, and he just died.
[318:35.81]Do I not have any captains left?
[318:37.54]What happened?
[318:40.41]Dude, I just went into the casino with like $1,000 and like two hours went by and I reached into my pocket and there was no money in there.
[318:47.89]And I'm just sitting there like, wait a minute, hold on.
[318:49.83]I came in here with $1,000.
[318:51.05]There's nothing in here.
[318:52.31]Fuck.
[319:01.77]I sent them all into the pits.
[319:02.68]This is too addicting.
[319:08.02]Wait, do I not have any...
[319:11.12]Wait a minute.
[319:11.44]Who's up there?
[319:13.58]Bink's still up there, right?
[319:15.74]It's alright, guys.
[319:16.24]All that matters is that Bink's still alive.
[319:19.37]I got Bruise.
[319:19.95]I got Bink.
[319:23.45]I got Blade.
[319:25.53]Okay.
[319:26.53]Um, so... Um... No more pits.
[319:32.27]We're done.
[319:38.37]I have a skill.
[319:40.70]What is this?
[319:43.88]Death threat.
[319:46.94]Let me take a look at some stuff down here.
[319:49.80]Elven Rage.
[319:51.00]Shadow Strider.
[319:51.76]What is that?
[319:54.78]Vault over an Urg and freeze them.
[320:00.36]I think I like that.
[320:02.64]I think I do.
[320:07.49]Double charge your glaive for more follow-up attacks.
[320:13.05]Tap X repeatedly after charging.
[320:14.65]I like that.
[320:16.47]Yeah.
[320:21.55]Go in the inventory for a minute.
[320:26.63]Nope.
[320:29.71]Am I ever going to get this?
[320:32.19]Use an execution to kill an online vendetta target of level 20.
[320:35.59]I mean, I'm not even doing those missions.
[320:39.68]Oh well.
[320:41.80]I missed Skin Peeler already.
[320:43.06]Yeah, we just got too addicted to the fucking roulette table.
[320:47.72]We were playing roulette too much.
[320:50.10]We lost it all.
[320:56.40]This is just better.
[321:01.99]Nine elf shot replenished per captain kill.
[321:04.47]Just health.
[321:05.95]Just take it.
[321:06.77]I have a lot of... I gotta do some gem stuff here.
[321:10.25]I'm going to hold on to that.
[321:11.87]The enraged enemy thing is kind of worth having.
[321:16.14]A lot of heads.
[321:24.36]That beast thing needs to be unlocked.
[321:25.87]Kill an enemy while mounted.
[321:26.87]I'm just going to do that.
[321:30.63]Poison.
[321:30.99]What if there's a poison enemy?
[321:35.07]It's we.
[321:35.81]You kept saying winners go on.
[321:37.41]No, I made up the rule, the fake rule that winners go on, and then I had to adhere to it, and I got addicted to it.
[321:51.28]I have some gems, right?
[321:52.42]Let's do... Now I can finally make a third tier gem.
[322:00.62]This is increase max health by 20%.
[322:02.24]That's good.
[322:04.78]So let's put that in.
[322:06.04]I guess it doesn't matter what I put it in, right?
[322:10.94]Okay.
[322:12.45]And unlock the ring slot for fun.
[322:15.19]Just because.
[322:16.13]Increased follower damage.
[322:22.99]We'll do that one.
[322:23.55]Why not?
[322:28.56]Alright.
[322:31.38]What's new?
[322:35.80]I guess we can travel around, right?
[322:37.23]This is why I like this shit.
[322:41.03]You must have at least one follower to fight in the follower pits.
[322:46.35]Whoops.
[322:49.15]I gotta pee again.
[322:52.01]Hold on.
[322:52.45]Give me one more minute.
[322:53.69]I gotta piss again.
[322:54.71]I've been here for like not even 40 minutes.
[322:56.71]I gotta pee again.
[322:57.65]Really?
[322:58.22]I've been drinking too much like iced tea.
[323:01.24]Give me two minutes.
[324:38.04]Okay, so here's the plan.
[324:41.31]It's getting to be almost like one o'clock in the morning.
[324:44.21]Let's get, let's do like one more mission.
[324:46.77]Wrap it up after that.
[324:47.49]It'll be probably somewhere around six hours at that point.
[324:50.96]And we're going to put, we're going to put Shadow War on the shelf for at least one night because tomorrow I do want to at least try The Evil Within 2.
[325:02.17]And, like, the new South Park game, like, comes out instead.
[325:04.55]There's a lot of shit to play.
[325:06.73]I complained a lot about how no games are coming out.
[325:08.69]And then, like, in two weeks, like, six different AAA games have come out.
[325:15.17]So, tomorrow night, you shall see.
[325:19.10]The Evil Within 2.
[325:25.50]Let's keep moving.
[325:29.48]One more mission or so.
[325:32.16]Same time, we're going to start at like 7.
[325:34.28]7-ish.
[325:36.78]We'll have some fun.
[325:39.16]Speaking of fun.
[325:43.18]I did not want to do that.
[325:45.93]So I need to back up.
[325:47.81]Let's do the next story mission.
[325:49.33]Wherever the fuck that is.
[325:55.53]There's one here.
[325:57.29]The Goroth... Tar Goroth rises from its pit and... Gor...
[326:04.37]Targoroth rises from its pit in Gorgoroth.
[326:07.89]It cannot be allowed to reach the surface.
[326:13.70]Why are the Star Wars rebel icons on the map?
[326:15.52]That's what I said too.
[326:17.12]I'm glad somebody else picked up on that because I said that last stream and it was weird.
[326:22.62]Skinpeeler.
[326:24.74]10.30pm to 12.30pm.
[326:28.50]He only lived for two hours and he was our favorite.
[326:31.43]I just got cocky.
[326:36.52]Well, there's a siege there.
[326:42.13]You also said that last stream.
[326:43.43]Well, I'm sorry that I didn't see it.
[326:49.30]You know what I wish would stop happening?
[326:51.14]Here's a complaint for the game.
[326:52.70]You want to hear one of my complaints?
[326:54.97]Stop telling me I can shoulder tackle people.
[326:58.51]And stop telling me how to stealth kill.
[327:02.73]You know, like... At this point, it's been like eight and a half, nine hours in the game.
[327:08.41]You don't have to tell me how to shoulder tackle anymore.
[327:12.85]Alright, so here we are.
[327:13.79]This is a whole new region.
[327:17.42]So, let's get intel on all the guys.
[327:19.30]Guy in the top right.
[327:20.36]No.
[327:22.46]Yeah, we need to start.
[327:23.12]We need to get some captains here.
[327:26.31]I don't like this guy.
[327:29.28]Turn it off?
[327:29.98]You can turn it off those things?
[327:36.56]Can I actually turn that shit off?
[327:44.28]Minimap cluster.
[327:46.96]Combat hints.
[327:51.42]Jesus.
[327:53.96]Jesus.
[327:59.51]Turning this off will remove the prompts.
[328:01.07]The button prompts?
[328:01.89]How?
[328:02.07]When you're supposed to guess?
[328:04.25]You have to guess one of the face buttons?
[328:05.81]That's terrible.
[328:11.19]Summon prompts.
[328:13.31]I mean, those are nice to have.
[328:21.23]Command cluster.
[328:23.59]Alright.
[328:24.75]This is how tired I am.
[328:25.99]I just thought that said Evan Almighty.
[328:30.94]The Evan Almighty prompt.
[328:32.24]Turn this off to make sure that you don't see the sequel to this movie.
[328:38.14]Okay.
[328:38.64]Maybe I'll turn a lot of these off.
[328:39.74]Let's see.
[328:40.18]Let's go.
[328:41.24]Apply these changes.
[328:45.61]Let's just go to this section over here.
[328:50.39]New zone.
[328:52.17]Still lots to do in the other zone.
[328:54.92]What does this mean?
[328:55.78]That thing blinking right now, the banner.
[328:58.34]What does that mean?
[328:59.26]What is this?
[329:00.32]What are you?
[329:01.42]What is this?
[329:02.90]He places a banner.
[329:05.82]And then everybody freaks out?
[329:09.08]Oh, wait, this is the... This is the guy we just... This pirate is the guy that we just found out about.
[329:16.71]He's level 34!
[329:22.84]I'm not supposed to be here.
[329:25.14]I'm not supposed to be in this zone.
[329:28.78]What in the name of God?
[329:33.32]Uh-huh.
[329:34.70]Well.
[329:40.65]Can I do it?
[329:45.25]I wonder if I can do it.
[329:45.99]There's two captains here, by the way.
[329:47.33]29 and 34.
[329:51.70]Right into the fucking fire.
[329:59.12]What?
[330:00.02]Fine.
[330:00.28]You wanna summon shit?
[330:01.47]I can summon my crew.
[330:04.71]Where's my guy?
[330:05.69]Where's my crew?
[330:10.25]Where is he?
[330:10.57]Alright, he dead.
[330:11.59]I got the Ninja Turtles with me.
[330:12.47]Good.
[330:16.48]Arrow proof.
[330:17.14]Of course he is.
[330:23.88]Yeah, we're cleaning him up.
[330:25.84]I've recruited level fucking 30 full.
[330:27.22]We're going right to the fighting pits.
[330:31.68]No, no, not my Ninja Turtles.
[330:34.29]No!
[330:39.41]Right in the stomach, come on.
[330:42.09]On fire.
[330:45.03]I gotta drain somebody.
[330:58.65]Good.
[330:59.31]Good.
[331:00.13]Good.
[331:00.39]Come on.
[331:00.95]Can I dominate?
[331:01.49]I can't dominate him.
[331:02.37]He's a higher level than me.
[331:06.71]It's like I... I can't do this, right?
[331:32.58]Don't do it!
[331:34.06]I gotta split him up.
[331:42.62]I can't dominate him.
[331:43.38]If I do this, shame him.
[331:46.40]Okay, I'm gonna shame this guy.
[331:54.05]Level 20.
[331:55.11]Okay, he's leveled down.
[331:56.39]Now he's mine.
[332:00.17]Next time.
[332:03.15]You, on the other hand, I'm not so sure I can fucking handle you.
[332:13.46]Maybe I am, up close and personal with this guy.
[332:16.34]All he is, the range is all that matters.
[332:23.71]Immune to executions, that's alright.
[332:25.49]We'll break him down anyways.
[332:28.45]And I'm going to kill him, by the way.
[332:30.19]I'm going to kill this guy because he's so much higher level.
[332:32.07]It'll prove to so many orcs how cool I am.
[332:47.20]And... get him.
[332:51.58]But think of the pits.
[332:52.46]I can't dominate him.
[332:54.96]All I can do is bring his level down to mine.
[332:59.39]No, fight to the death.
[333:01.13]I want to kill this guy.
[333:02.69]He's immune to executions, I forgot already.
[333:15.43]In the bushes, we don't even get to see the kill.
[333:18.61]That was in his mouth.
[333:22.39]That's gonna give me a ton.
[333:23.13]Look at that experience.
[333:24.09]A thousand XP.
[333:27.95]That's barely any.
[333:31.63]But I did get a new ring.
[333:35.00]Let's take a look.
[333:37.72]It's pretty fucking great.
[333:40.28]That's really good, actually.
[333:41.30]I just have to kill a captain, and then I get a 35% chance to recover all health when I kill somebody.
[333:47.69]A captain.
[333:49.51]Uh, yeah.
[333:50.51]I believe so.
[333:57.63]That's really, really... That's incredible.
[334:02.81]Let's keep on moving.
[334:03.91]Let's do this last mission, and then I'm gonna get to bed.
[334:07.13]By bed, I mean eat food.
[334:09.63]Who?
[334:09.89]Who is he talking about?
[334:13.21]Revenge for my bro- This guy's 38.
[334:15.65]Epic.
[334:16.05]I don't think I'm gonna be able to kill this guy.
[334:37.64]Oh.
[334:38.28]My.
[334:39.14]God.
[334:48.85]I don't think this guy is a guy I want to fuck with.
[334:53.01]So we're gonna run.
[334:54.37]We're gonna run away.
[334:55.23]We're gonna run away from the Goblin King.
[334:59.01]And by run, I mean like actually run and don't like watch him like you're looking at the rearview mirror in GTA.
[335:12.31]Go up the log.
[335:13.21]I have to run from this guy.
[335:18.51]This is not good.
[335:19.93]Jim?
[335:22.01]Look, there's a Jeremy!
[335:22.71]Are there any grogs around?
[335:30.70]Can I summon a grog?
[335:31.54]Alright, he's gone.
[335:35.98]You're calling me a coward?
[335:39.01]How am I a coward?
[335:39.91]This guy is... Now he's fireproof.
[335:42.97]Okay, well, whatever.
[335:45.59]Oh, he's running through fire.
[335:49.59]He's running through fire just to prove that he's fireproof.
[335:52.90]He's fighting Karagoz.
[336:00.08]What is on there?
[336:02.06]What's the green?
[336:06.17]Oh, it's just broken.
[336:07.03]Okay.
[336:26.20]I couldn't stealth them.
[336:27.84]Oh, come on.
[336:28.90]Okay.
[336:39.27]Hey, what do you know about this guy?
[336:40.37]Alright, let's see.
[336:43.97]What do you know?
[336:45.93]What do you know about him?
[336:47.73]Heavily damaged by beasts.
[336:50.31]Fear of execution.
[336:55.51]Damage by range, damage by executions, damage by stealth.
[336:58.69]So he's terrified of executions.
[337:02.31]And if I get my Carragher, I can go after him.
[337:06.94]Poison master.
[337:08.32]Poison weapon.
[337:10.18]He's a tank.
[337:11.99]Enraged by acrobatics.
[337:13.91]And he's fireproof.
[337:19.13]Well, that's all I needed to know.
[337:21.99]I mean, you know what I could do?
[337:27.36]Yeah, please target the same guy over and over again.
[337:29.66]That would be fucking fantastic, wouldn't it?
[337:35.12]I'm coming at this guy with like fucking 30 people.
[337:36.96]Fucking acrobats.
[337:40.90]How dare they.
[337:42.70]Alright, activate.
[337:45.11]Come with me.
[338:11.96]That hurt him a lot.
[338:13.08]Did you see that?
[338:16.75]Bring the dog.
[338:21.39]Alright, come on.
[338:23.23]Where are my little shits?
[338:31.99]What?
[338:32.21]Just come fight.
[338:36.88]They're just cheering me on.
[338:39.90]That dazed him.
[338:40.92]I'm gonna get him.
[338:43.44]He's fucking in trouble.
[339:03.63]Oh, no, I froze him.
[339:11.13]Come on, I gotta get him.
[339:14.00]There it is.
[339:17.30]I'm gonna get so much fucking shit.
[339:18.82]Fear of execution is terrifying.
[339:19.78]Get him.
[339:26.21]Run him into the fire.
[339:31.14]I am poisoned.
[339:32.24]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[339:34.42]I have to kill one of my friends.
[339:41.10]I have like three guys now.
[339:42.84]Okay, no, you're fine.
[339:44.14]Bring him in.
[339:50.59]He's done.
[339:51.65]See you later.
[339:55.19]I want whatever he has.
[339:57.35]Kill him.
[340:01.45]Right through the heart.
[340:02.19]Didn't think I was gonna beat him, did you?
[340:04.06]Yeah, that's what you think.
[340:12.60]That's fine.
[340:13.56]That's fine.
[340:14.18]I'll kill you again.
[340:15.58]The raid boss.
[340:26.85]Through the back, stab.
[340:28.72]No, I don't want to aggro those guys.
[340:33.00]Oh, fuck, they're coming down here.
[340:39.15]Take him down this way.
[340:40.17]Oh, boy.
[340:50.54]Run his back.
[340:52.64]Take him down.
[340:53.75]Keep making him go down this way.
[340:56.87]Death defying is annoying.
[340:58.71]It is pretty annoying, but it's alright.
[341:00.17]I'm still gonna kill him.
[341:01.41]Health shot right here.
[341:07.47]Oh!
[341:09.25]No!
[341:13.08]No!
[341:29.40]You take my blood, brother.
[341:32.25]I take your blood.
[341:40.88]It was all going so well.
[341:44.96]I wasn't gonna beat this guy.
[341:46.08]Fucking like 20 levels higher than me and he's epic and now he's even worse.
[341:49.48]Death defying dog shit.
[342:00.23]That's what I get for showing off.
[342:01.23]I'm not showing off.
[342:02.23]I was trying to kill him because I wanted the epic gear.
[342:04.56]This is all because I fucking made Skinpeeler die in the pits.
[342:15.16]That head smash was insane.
[342:16.28]Damn it.
[342:16.80]I can't go get him.
[342:17.96]He's like even better now.
[342:29.37]What is this?
[342:29.79]No, that's not going to work.
[342:31.21]What is this mission?
[342:34.74]Let's just go here.
[342:37.40]The stream is over anyways.
[342:40.24]This is a bonus part of the stream.
[342:43.98]I went to go pick up the elf shot and I got hit one time on the side of the head.
[342:47.00]Then he turned my head into a grape.
[342:50.04]Let's take out the whole line.
[343:03.64]See, I didn't even do that.
[343:05.30]That's such bullshit.
[343:06.82]That guy walked into the fire and I was gonna kill all of them and now it's just chaos.
[343:12.44]What the fuck is happening?
[343:14.30]Why is this happening?
[343:16.44]Why is it... I just wanted to backstab like three people.
[343:31.40]God damn it, man.
[343:33.14]Why?
[343:35.26]You just left the whole forest on fire for no reason.
[343:39.24]Get me the fuck out of here.
[343:40.36]I'm gone.
[343:40.84]Bye.
[343:41.13]That just escalated so much.
[343:52.21]There's no reason for that kind of escalation.
[344:00.58]That was, okay, you know when you light up a firework, like a firecracker?
[344:03.76]A packet of firecrackers?
[344:05.00]That was it.
[344:07.88]We just watched, that was a dog and human version of a firecracker packet going off.
[344:12.67]Wait, I'm at the wrong way.
[344:13.91]This guy's 25.
[344:14.83]Shadow of Mordor in a nutshell.
[344:28.23]Somebody else is on fire behind there.
[344:29.75]There's another person on fire behind there.
[344:32.25]Watch out for the fire.
[344:35.96]It's just going to be like, this is going to, the guy's just going to blow up and this guy's going to get hit.
[344:41.04]And then we're just going to sprint around and just shoot fucking everybody in the light on fire.
[344:47.23]I told you so.
[345:00.82]Get him off the horse.
[345:02.94]Good job.
[345:04.96]I didn't want to kill you.
[345:06.40]God damn it.
[345:07.98]He's dazed.
[345:09.16]Stab him.
[345:10.82]Oh my god.
[345:11.42]Get the fuck out of here.
[345:17.36]Fault breaker.
[345:18.06]Of course he is.
[345:18.83]No.
[345:19.07]Not another one of these fucking idiots.
[345:28.65]This is such a bad place to fight.
[345:31.21]This whole zone is just a fucking cartoon joke.
[345:36.45]I don't have any more elf shot.
[345:40.94]God damn it.
[345:41.76]Okay, bring in my friends.
[345:47.36]Charge it up.
[345:50.38]I just wanted to do the fucking mission over here.
[345:53.47]We've just taken so long to get there.
[345:59.75]I can't vault.
[346:00.15]I gotta dodge.
[346:00.75]No vaulting.
[346:02.25]As I do it.
[346:02.79]As I vault into him.
[346:13.56]Into the fire.
[346:22.26]I can't even talk.
[346:27.78]Why?
[346:32.00]This game is fucking perfect.
[346:34.96]It wasn't even close!
[346:35.98]Alright, can we please get out of the fucking fire area?
[346:39.28]Please?
[346:40.56]Just go this way.
[346:42.42]Pull them out of there.
[346:46.32]Why are they fighting each other?
[346:47.40]They're not.
[346:48.00]Oh, he just blew the fucking horn.
[346:49.52]Of course he did.
[346:50.26]Why wouldn't he?
[346:52.90]At least they're aware we're from the geysers Fuck is happening right now Who is it's you?
[347:06.72]Okay, why don't you just sacrifice this guy?
[347:13.39]Okay, hi I
[347:22.01]I gotta stun him.
[347:23.79]I can't.
[347:26.63]Not being able to vault over this guy sucks.
[347:29.51]I'm gonna die to this fucking guy.
[347:31.01]I really am.
[347:31.53]And here come more assholes.
[347:36.53]Guy with a shield that you can't vault over.
[347:38.25]Like, I found the thing that I hate.
[347:39.49]Hey, arrows up here.
[347:53.55]I can't do anything about this guy.
[347:56.48]God damn it!
[347:57.46]No!
[347:59.34]Fucking geysers!
[348:00.64]You stupid... And he has a spear, and now he's on fire.
[348:09.68]It's okay.
[348:13.82]There's no rhyme or reason to anything in this zone.
[348:17.69]This is just the guy who runs around in the stunt costume.
[348:23.45]Stunt double runs around with the suit on, engulfed in flames in an action movie.
[348:28.31]That's this whole zone.
[348:29.83]It's too funny.
[348:33.17]Jesus, it's funny.
[348:38.88]What the hell?
[348:40.10]Get off me!
[348:41.70]No, don't!
[348:45.31]Don't do it.
[348:53.33]We're fine.
[348:54.61]Run at me.
[348:57.68]Great.
[349:01.60]Good job.
[349:01.96]Yeah, that was good.
[349:02.78]Good twigs.
[349:03.52]Way to work.
[349:07.74]Freeze him.
[349:17.51]Get over here.
[349:18.93]No.
[349:19.47]Cut his fucking head off.
[349:27.11]I got a new bow.
[349:30.11]Where's the mission?
[349:36.37]It's too much.
[349:37.61]This game really is too much.
[349:38.75]Wait, rat.
[349:40.59]Got it.
[349:40.81]What's up on this ledge?
[349:47.69]Salty?
[349:48.09]Oh, no, I'm not salty.
[349:49.03]I'm having a blast.
[349:49.85]This is fucking hilarious.
[349:50.85]Okay, this is it.
[349:55.09]We're going to do this.
[349:56.29]And that's going to be the end of the stream.
[349:58.28]Targaroth rises from its pit.
[349:59.52]It cannot be allowed to reach the surface.
[350:01.64]Whatever that means.
[350:04.76]Here's the mission.
[350:12.02]It only took us like 40 minutes to get here.
[350:15.42]And of course they're going to have like a Gul'dan.
[350:16.75]Doesn't this happen in Warcraft?
[350:19.25]It really is Gul'dan.
[350:20.49]Wow.
[350:22.27]They're doing some type of summoning.
[350:49.93]Rise!
[350:50.65]Rise!
[350:53.69]Rise!
[350:55.87]Zog the Eternal, new target.
[350:59.33]Defeat the Acolytes.
[351:02.38]I think I can do that.
[351:07.58]I think I can do that.
[351:09.58]Mm-hmm.
[351:13.20]Mm-hmm.
[351:18.60]Up, boy.
[351:19.09]Up.
[351:20.01]Up, boy.
[351:22.19]Oh, I could feel that one.
[351:28.63]That was sick.
[351:31.62]Look at this acolyte.
[351:32.42]Check this one out.
[351:33.12]I'm going to kill this guy in less than a quarter of a second.
[351:34.96]Ready?
[351:35.12]A quarter of a second!
[351:39.38]Alright.
[351:39.72]Mac, if you're watching this, you have to edit this part.
[351:42.75]Ready?
[351:45.58]See that dude over there?
[351:47.18]I'm gonna get this guy in a quarter of a second.
[351:49.02]QUARTER OF A SECOND!
[351:51.62]Last turn.
[351:55.99]Seems like a pretty tough shot over there.
[351:58.69]It's alright.
[351:59.53]I'll be able to kill this guy in a quarter of a second.
[352:01.03]QUARTER OF A SECOND!
[352:02.21]Fuck it, just... got him.
[352:04.03]No, I didn't.
[352:05.93]Whatever.
[352:06.60]Clap.
[352:07.38]Clap for me!
[352:08.84]I wanna see you clap for me!
[352:13.16]He's not watching.
[352:17.08]I need more alpha shot.
[352:18.62]Good thing there's alpha shot right next to me.
[352:20.18]Good thing there's at least one.
[352:22.63]Where's the other one?
[352:26.13]Come on.
[352:27.37]Come on.
[352:30.73]Please climb.
[352:35.98]I'm gonna try for like some... I'm gonna go for some crazy shit here.
[352:38.22]Ready?
[352:38.42]Watch this.
[352:39.96]Hold on.
[352:44.86]I wonder if I can do it.
[352:48.88]I can't see that guy, so... That guy's alone down there?
[352:57.16]He's gonna make a real laser.
[352:59.81]Here we go.
[353:04.91]Ready?
[353:05.61]Check this out.
[353:06.11]I'm gonna dismount, do the flip.
[353:10.99]I didn't do anything.
[353:14.59]Forget I said a goddamn word, okay?
[353:27.00]Two more Acolytes.
[353:29.42]Last Acolytes up here.
[353:31.68]He's investigating, that's fine.
[353:33.12]Bite his neck.
[353:36.03]Okay.
[353:37.01]Where's he going?
[353:56.39]Nice.
[353:56.99]That was a double team.
[353:58.89]Perfect.
[354:03.47]He did that to get behind me to identify himself.
[354:07.53]You really shook the world with that ring forging trick of yours.
[354:13.23]After that, Targroth only needed a little coaxing.
[354:17.65]Just a little.
[354:19.46]I can take this guy.
[354:20.46]It rises to the surface.
[354:22.18]Should I have my own warlock?
[354:23.16]And it comes for you.
[354:25.42]If I can, I'll take him.
[354:29.04]I will steal him if I can't take him.
[354:32.91]This is a vault breaker.
[354:36.43]Yep, he sure is.
[354:49.71]Fucking vault breakers.
[354:59.53]No!
[355:01.29]Oh no, Sauron is staring at me.
[355:09.76]Hey, good thing the game has auto-tracking.
[355:11.58]Send him to the pit, if I can do it.
[355:14.76]Send him to the pit, the pit, the pit, the pit.
[355:17.22]I'm gonna try.
[355:18.28]I don't think I can do it, though.
[355:19.70]Well, I'm going into the pit, so...
[355:38.68]We're gonna see how I fare into the pit.
[355:40.38]Alright.
[355:42.20]Balrog.
[355:43.10]They're gonna bring out a... giant demon, right?
[356:00.83]Can I control the Balrog and send him to the pit?
[356:08.36]He is very large.
[356:16.42]Looks like he might be in charge.
[356:18.64]Voldemort's fan father.
[356:36.41]Dark Souls boss incoming.
[356:38.00]I get an equalizer.
[356:39.04]Do I get my own version?
[357:01.60]Akela Brimbo just disappears when he gets called out.
[357:03.90]He's like, no, I wasn't here.
[357:05.64]I'm just a ghost.
[357:07.40]I'm just a human guy the whole time.
[357:14.19]Quick time?
[357:17.75]No.
[357:19.59]I'm just watching.
[357:26.39]Avoid getting hit by falling debris.
[357:32.30]That made him angry.
[357:33.18]When they say falling debris, what do they mean by that?
[357:40.00]Right in the mouth?
[357:40.68]Right in the teeth?
[357:41.28]I gotta hit him right in his teeth, right?
[357:48.87]That's the thing that's lit up yellow, his teeth.
[357:54.89]Well, I got hit by the falling debris.
[358:04.43]Where else are we going to shoot him?
[358:05.76]In his fucking long dick?
[358:08.72]Oh, that's his tail.
[358:09.50]I guess he just has to wait.
[358:20.14]You just watch the fight, and then you wait.
[358:27.76]He's got his... They're like dancing.
[358:34.91]They're doing the whose-line-is-it-anyways thing where one guy stands behind and puts their arms through his shoulders and pretends like he's moving his hands while the other guy talks.
[358:55.54]Alright, this is a lot less- a lot less involved than I thought- oh god.
[358:58.46]I was just locked in the corner.
[359:11.66]Gotta shoot him right in his Godzilla back.
[359:14.71]Yeah, yep.
[359:16.47]I'm just fucking not paying any attention.
[359:20.59]You gotta get him out of the corner so I can see his back!
[359:23.93]I can't see his back when he's pinned up like this way.
[359:26.15]Get over here!
[359:27.49]Let him out!
[359:28.77]Let him out of the corner!
[359:35.35]Let him out of the corner!
[359:45.29]Huh?
[359:49.95]Okay, I gotta mount the tree god.
[359:54.59]New objective.
[359:55.53]Oh boy, watch this failure.
[359:59.02]What can I climb?
[360:00.90]Apparently this.
[360:06.70]Watch out!
[360:07.22]Watch out for the spikes!
[360:12.17]Up here.
[360:17.19]And up here.
[360:18.46]Oh, you dumb idiot.
[360:22.54]Go all the way up.
[360:23.26]What are you doing?
[360:24.86]Climb.
[360:27.63]Climb.
[360:32.65]Only link a little bit further.
[360:34.33]Where's he at?
[360:38.93]Right there.
[360:40.63]Quick time.
[360:41.07]This is going to be all quick time, isn't it?
[360:47.77]Yeah, it is.
[360:54.42]I just have to punch him in the face like five or six thousand times.
[360:57.02]Here comes the quick time.
[361:08.56]This is so sloppy, I love it.
[361:11.76]Oh, I gave him a headlock!
[361:15.26]Give him a DDT!
[361:15.91]There's not much else I can do besides this.
[361:24.29]Besides rock him in the face over and over again.
[361:26.79]And here comes the execute.
[361:33.36]Not quite.
[361:37.30]In the face again.
[361:37.98]Oh.
[361:39.80]What do we got?
[361:42.92]Gotta give him a one-two punch.
[361:44.12]Yeah.
[361:47.21]The crossbody punch.
[361:48.27]He's gonna take off again.
[361:50.43]No.
[361:51.37]I don't want to climb another five steps to kill this guy.
[361:53.39]What am I doing here?
[362:04.71]Good thing I have this move!
[362:08.95]Good thing I had that.
[362:11.57]Oh, he's mad.
[362:15.19]Did you just say this feels like knack?
[362:23.66]You're making a joke.
[362:24.94]You're making like a donkey joke, right?
[362:28.35]This is not knack.
[362:43.62]You know, is it weird for me to say that I think that they only made Knack 2 because Dunkey made a bunch of videos on it?
[362:52.26]And they were like, oh shit, we gotta make Knack 2!
[362:55.96]Some people will at least buy it.
[362:58.40]Like, he was the sole reason why they made Knack 2.
[363:01.78]I'm convinced.
[363:05.44]Knack 1 got like a 4 out of 10, didn't it?
[363:07.54]Why would they make another one?
[363:10.15]There's like no reason why.
[363:14.72]The meme went too far.
[363:37.12]Well, there it is.
[363:38.30]Lots of experience.
[363:39.18]Get the level up skill point.
[363:40.46]And we get to do a cool, fun boss fight.
[363:43.30]I got to press X a couple times.
[363:44.48]I pressed triangle.
[363:45.48]I pressed A a few times.
[363:47.74]It was cool.
[363:48.48]Look at the Gondor.
[363:55.81]And then Minas Tiril.
[363:57.09]And then Ethel.
[363:58.17]And then we're going to go back to Washington, D.C.
[363:59.59]and take back the White House!
[364:03.37]Howard Dean joke from fucking 2000.
[364:05.03]That's right.
[364:07.70]That's right.
[364:08.18]You heard it here only I Don't want to do this part
[364:26.18]Alright, see down there?
[364:27.16]I just have to fucking get one timely arrow through here, arc it, and hit the fucking Warchief in the head.
[364:40.36]Are you serious?
[364:40.90]I got it!
[364:41.24]Did you hear that?
[364:44.07]Did you get a hit marker?
[364:46.07]Holy shit, look at it.
[364:46.79]I'm gonna try it again.
[364:47.43]One more try.
[364:51.35]Listen close, listen.
[364:57.05]Oh!
[364:58.16]I fucking got another one.
[365:01.48]One.
[365:04.16]Two.
[365:11.17]Three.
[365:12.01]Oh!
[365:13.61]What?
[365:17.25]Okay.
[365:17.47]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[365:22.10]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[365:23.82]We're going to play...
[365:27.86]Uh, the Evil Within 2.
[365:30.70]Have a good night.
[365:34.76]But, before we go... Yeah.
[365:38.32]Tomorrow, 7 o'clock, Friday.
[365:40.17]Evil Within 2.
[365:41.01]We'll give it a try.
[365:42.29]And if for some reason it's not fun, or I don't like it, or I'm not into it, then we can always come back and play this.
[365:46.73]This is always now an option for at least the next week or two.
[365:49.49]Let me just get this going.
[365:55.95]And, before I go...
[365:58.70]I'm going to say thank you to NoSoup4U, Mr. Mod, for the $15.
[366:06.99]Thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[366:07.65]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thank you for all the laughs and streams over the years.
[366:11.19]Recently, school has been depressing me, and I haven't been able to watch your streams because of work, but it's great to be here tonight, and the laughter tonight has at least got my mind off my problems temporarily.
[366:20.27]Well, Soup, you're always a fun guy.
[366:22.82]Glad to have you.
[366:30.34]Hopefully you're, you know, not letting school depress you that much.
[366:37.51]I know it can be a pain in the ass.
[366:40.41]Back to the roulette wheel.
[366:41.49]No.
[366:42.19]We're not going back to the roulette wheel tonight.
[366:44.97]But, yeah.
[366:45.39]You've been around for a long time, man.
[366:48.95]One of our resident mods.
[366:52.19]Thank you, though.
[366:54.81]Stick with it, man.
[366:58.21]Stick with it.
[367:01.19]And I also want to do something tonight, too, that I haven't done in a while.
[367:03.43]I'm going to see if I can do it.
[367:05.11]Because I've been trying to figure out a solution to subs and resubs and all that stuff.
[367:10.57]And I wanted to hire a programmer to make me, like, an end credits thing.
[367:14.60]And it's going to cost, like, more money than I thought.
[367:16.80]It's going to take a lot more work than I thought.
[367:18.90]So I kind of have to figure that out.
[367:20.32]And until then...
[367:22.28]What we're going to do is I'm going to see if I can get it done.
[367:24.56]Let me see one second here before I do that.
[367:28.62]Benjo, or Benj0313, thanks for the three bucks.
[367:33.27]Very excited to watch you play The Evil Within.
[367:34.95]I want to dedicate these few bits to paying for treatment for your gambling addiction.
[367:39.55]If we address this problem sooner, Skin Peeler wouldn't have lost.
[367:43.93]We wouldn't have lost Skin Peeler.
[367:45.73]That's true.
[367:47.82]Thank you, Ronnie Jizzo, for the five dollars.
[367:50.64]A five hour stream gets emotional.
[367:54.00]Actually, it's a six-hour stream now.
[367:56.79]A six-hour plus stream now.
[367:59.55]But thank you, Ronnie.
[368:01.73]Also, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the five dollars.
[368:04.51]I know you always try to stay humble about things or get self-conscious about some stream stuff, but I can genuinely say that if there were more Jermas in the world, the world would be a better place.
[368:12.50]You're gonna make me fucking cry, man.
[368:14.18]It would also make the next live-action Jerma rumble much more interesting.
[368:17.50]Anyways, look forward to each of your streams, and I hope to hear good news from your upcoming projects.
[368:22.16]Love you.
[368:24.09]Well... Um... I... I don't know.
[368:28.51]If there were more of me in the world, it'd be really weird.
[368:31.98]But I do appreciate the extraordinarily kind words.
[368:34.86]You ever think about that?
[368:36.96]No?
[368:37.60]Like, I'm gonna touch upon what you're saying here.
[368:39.26]Can you imagine if, like, you bumped into somebody in the street, like, somewhere in the world, and it was just you again?
[368:47.34]You have to figure that, like, DNA, like, human DNA is finite, right?
[368:51.00]There's only a certain amount of, like, actual strands of DNA that somebody can have in their body for, like, facial features and stuff.
[368:57.54]So somebody somewhere in the world has to pretty much be an exact copy of you, the way that you look, at least.
[369:06.06]Imagine, like, running into that person that has, like, nearly, like, the identical DNA.
[369:10.74]Would you fight?
[369:11.20]I think I might fight that person, because I'd be like, I don't know, I don't believe you.
[369:14.71]This guy could be, like, some random guy from, like, fucking Norway.
[369:18.29]And I would bump into him, and I'd be like, that's me.
[369:20.65]And he'd be like, I don't understand what you're saying, man.
[369:23.33]Like, I don't speak this English.
[369:26.26]And I'm like, well, excuse me, you are speaking English, and you're me.
[369:29.68]And he'd be like, I'm trying so hard to tell you, I don't understand.
[369:33.10]And I would just didnt just throw a huge punch.
[369:34.94]I would haymaker him in the face.
[369:38.30]And then I would get arrested.
[369:40.48]Then he goes like this.
[369:42.12]I get arrested, I get put in jail.
[369:44.19]And then the police question him.
[369:45.65]They're like, oh, so what happened there?
[369:47.33]And he's like, I don't know.
[369:49.79]I have no idea.
[369:50.49]He just come after me and tried to kill me.
[369:52.91]And they're like, oh, well, sorry, sir.
[369:55.17]Please take care.
[369:55.81]Have a good rest of your evening.
[369:57.55]And he walks out of the police station.
[369:58.71]I'm in fucking handcuffs.
[369:59.69]I'm in the jail cell.
[370:00.63]I'm going to get sentenced to death, by the way.
[370:02.75]And he walks out and he goes, fucking got him.
[370:07.07]It's me!
[370:07.93]And it would actually be me.
[370:09.23]Is this a metaphor?
[370:11.15]Jerma hates himself.
[370:11.99]No.
[370:13.43]I'm saying it was me.
[370:14.51]It was just a big fucking scam.
[370:17.53]I don't know how we got here.
[370:21.11]Anyways.
[370:21.53]I would be the fake one.
[370:22.81]The winner plays on it.
[370:27.05]Fucking word that better.
[370:28.32]But it's the end of the night.
[370:28.96]I'm tired.
[370:29.34]It's been six and a half hours.
[370:33.44]You would kiss your double?
[370:37.29]Dude, kissing your double is no different than you having your lips touch each other right now.
[370:41.78]Think about that.
[370:43.58]Your top and bottom lip right now are touching.
[370:46.74]What's the difference?
[370:49.39]Is your clone?
[370:50.93]It's the same lips.
[370:52.09]So right now you're kissing yourself by having your lips closed.
[370:57.63]Think about it.
[370:59.64]Get a scientist in here.
[371:09.25]Uh, you guys are fucking awesome.
[371:10.91]You guys are hilarious.
[371:13.81]It's too late for this.
[371:14.73]Nah, I know.
[371:15.29]I'm just fucking up.
[371:18.13]Anyways, though, thank you.
[371:18.83]Uh, thank you MooMeansMoo.
[371:21.07]I just got off on a weird tangent there, but thanks.
[371:23.45]Uh, anyways.
[371:28.81]Chroma Knight.
[371:29.49]Thank you, Chroma Knight, for the three bucks.
[371:31.83]I wanted to wait until you got the stronghold to say that you're a big inspiration.
[371:35.44]I always try to be the funny guy, and I always try to be witty and spontaneously funny whenever I can.
[371:41.70]And I'm surprised at how many jokes you can make consistently, even if some of them flop.
[371:48.19]Uh, well Chroma, I'm happy to be like a comedic inspiration.
[371:55.77]I don't know if I find myself particularly funny.
[371:57.79]I just talk.
[371:58.15]I just talk a lot of shit.
[372:00.72]And I have a lot of weird things and a lot of weird ideas.
[372:03.66]Does that make me funny?
[372:04.36]I don't know.
[372:06.08]I just kind of say whatever pops into the brain there.
[372:10.18]But if you enjoy it, if you're inspired by it, then by all means.
[372:12.98]They all flop.
[372:14.89]Look.
[372:17.15]Flop versus not flop.
[372:20.31]How do you determine that, right?
[372:21.47]Because think about it.
[372:23.21]Right now, I could say...
[372:26.90]I'm gonna say one word and it's not funny.
[372:29.08]It's not a funny word.
[372:30.04]It's nothing funny about it at all Chromatic abrasion somebody left one of you guys laughed at that somebody here laughed at that Comedy is so subjective.
[372:42.76]It's like impossible for me to like you try to be funny.
[372:45.31]Somebody just laughed at that I don't know who it was one of you did
[372:56.19]Look at how many people are laughing in this chat right now.
[373:00.33]Look at how many fucking people are laughing right now.
[373:03.91]And they're not doing like the fake H-A-H-A, not laugh, you're just saying it with a straight face.
[373:09.07]Look at all these huge LOLs.
[373:16.10]So I can't determine what's funny or not funny.
[373:18.24]That's for you to determine.
[373:19.24]I'm just the fucking clown in the driver's seat.
[373:23.52]And sometimes I step on the brake, sometimes I step on the gas.
[373:26.94]And I look back.
[373:29.64]And you either chuckle or you say that was not funny.
[373:31.84]And then I like fucking turn back and drive the car still.
[373:35.50]Because I can't stop driving the car.
[373:42.06]Anyways, thank you guys.
[373:44.98]But I do want to do this.
[373:48.02]Let me see.
[373:48.50]Let me see here.
[374:00.87]I do want to do this.
[374:02.35]I want to say that regardless of how much it's going to cost or how much time it's going to be, by next week's streams, so by Tuesday, I'm going to have a solution for the subs and the resubs.
[374:23.68]Hold me to that.
[374:24.82]Don't let me get away with that.
[374:26.96]Because I've been trying to figure out something and I need to sit here over the weekend and figure out exactly what I want to do.
[374:35.31]So hold me to that on Tuesday night because I'm going to have some kind of conclusion.
[374:43.01]Thank you everybody for subscribing to this channel and staying subscribed if you are.
[374:47.68]A lot of you have been here for fucking years.
[374:51.00]You've been giving me like Netflix money for two years.
[374:57.81]When I think about that, that goes through my brain.
[375:00.59]And my Netflix subscription, I've had it for a while now.
[375:07.77]You guys have been subbed to my channel more than my Netflix subscription I've had.
[375:12.89]So that's extremely important to me.
[375:15.42]And I don't want you guys to ever think I'm looking past it or pretending it doesn't exist.
[375:21.30]So I have to come up with a solution for it because I do appreciate every fucking single one of them.
[375:29.78]Some of you guys, a lot of people are going on a year, two years almost.
[375:35.61]And I can't say anything more besides thank you so much.
[375:39.35]And with that, I will see you guys tomorrow for the Evil Within.
[375:43.19]Have a good rest of your night.
[375:45.59]Take care of yourselves.
[375:46.62]I know we went really late into the night here.
[375:48.06]It's like 1.30 in the morning Eastern.
[375:50.70]Take care.
[375:51.36]Much love.
[375:51.90]Obviously, we're not going to be playing Shadow of War tomorrow.
[375:57.52]I might return to it.
[375:59.75]I might do a stream over the weekend, too, just to do it.
[376:02.59]But I'm going to give this game the two thumbs up for now.
[376:08.56]It might have a lot of microtransaction issues, but I've enjoyed this game so far for like the 10 hours or so I put into it.
[376:18.58]10, 11 hours.
[376:20.86]More than a lot of games I've played this year anyways.
[376:23.88]So however you feel about the microtransaction thing, as much as we all don't like it, there is still a really fun, engaging video game here.
[376:34.06]Take care, guys.
[376:34.55]See you tomorrow.
[376:36.19]Good night.
[376:44.28]the intro on this whole time what a idiot alright there we go now now how come nobody didn't anybody tell me that was going on did anybody mention that this is the alright good night bye see you later
[377:31.00]Thank you.
[378:15.30]It didn't work.
[378:15.72]I was trying to press Y. It didn't work.
[378:17.00]Good night, everybody.
[378:17.64]It didn't work.
[378:18.42]I tried to... Bye.
[378:20.99]It didn't make the noise.
