[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.62]Good morning.
[00:05.64]How are you?
[00:07.12]On this fine Saturday morning.
[00:11.49]Very early today.
[00:12.85]Yeah, we're at 14 right now.
[00:17.63]Going by military time.
[00:19.01]I'm gonna cross the border.
[00:20.39]Kind of guy.
[00:25.23]Don't have to have exact time frames and...
[00:29.66]numbers that mean what time zone are you in.
[00:32.06]No, we just go by 14.
[00:33.20]That's it.
[00:34.32]Everybody knows what that is.
[00:39.71]But if you're wondering why we're so early today, there are a couple of reasons.
[00:45.67]And I will tell you the number one reason once enough people get in here.
[00:49.85]And we'll go from there.
[00:51.55]So give me a moment.
[00:54.18]Be here in a second.
[01:42.10]So why does my Twitch dashboard not believe me that I'm live?
[01:44.50]It just says I'm offline.
[01:48.72]I assure you I'm not offline.
[01:51.60]Or maybe I am.
[01:52.87]Is this a dream?
[01:55.61]This might be a dream.
[01:58.71]I've had dreams like this before.
[02:02.93]I press the live button and I just sit here staring at the starting soon screen.
[02:09.45]for like 10 straight minutes I don't know I was supposed to start the stream everybody's had that dream before even if you don't stream you could work you could work at like a VDBB financial and you'll have a stream dream
[02:30.21]Alright, anyways, we're so early today because later tonight, not early tonight, but late afternoon, I'm going to be recording the official podcast.
[02:42.14]So that's today.
[02:43.70]So I got to stream early, very early, to make room for me to get ready for the podcast.
[02:49.16]Should be fun.
[02:49.92]I have no idea what we're going to talk about.
[02:51.36]That's the fun part about the whole thing, right?
[02:56.65]Should we play Destroy All Humans 1 or should I move on to 2?
[03:02.05]I don't know.
[03:07.37]I was battling with this this morning.
[03:13.78]Where and when?
[03:14.86]I don't think... They don't stream it.
[03:16.12]I think it's just we record it.
[03:19.46]I should go with two.
[03:25.52]Because... They both suck?
[03:29.78]What?
[03:30.42]Come on, man.
[03:41.36]How far are we through 1?
[03:42.54]Let's just see.
[03:46.71]I'm gonna be a lying streamer right now.
[03:50.39]Like, this is bullshit, what you're seeing.
[03:52.89]This is Destroy All Humans 1.
[03:54.10]I just want to look at this.
[03:57.18]It doesn't mean we're gonna play this.
[03:58.20]I mean, I'm just gonna check it out.
[04:10.94]The game's about 10 hours.
[04:15.46]Don't make the mistake I made.
[04:16.62]What do you mean, make the mistake you made?
[04:19.52]Too loud.
[04:20.06]Yeah, I got it.
[04:25.05]Finish it.
[04:33.63]You finished what you started.
[04:35.97]Yeah.
[04:40.12]Yeah, let's be a man of our word.
[04:43.14]Let's finish Destroy All Humans 1.
[04:49.43]I've heard Destroy All Humans 1 is more of a gamer game, where you have to, it's hard.
[04:58.23]I'll be good.
[05:02.25]I'm not just gonna skip it.
[05:04.35]We'll probably at least, there's probably not much left.
[05:06.45]There's probably another like six hours or so.
[05:11.04]Although I'm not gonna be able to beat this right now.
[05:16.78]Oh shit, there's only 20% completion!
[05:19.60]Yeah, there's probably only like 35 more hours of this game.
[05:27.90]Alright, I'm gonna play two now.
[05:29.59]I'm gonna play two.
[05:30.93]Let's try two.
[05:32.65]We can go back to one.
[05:33.55]I just wanna see what happens in two.
[05:35.05]Oh, god damn it.
[05:41.70]Alright, let me just change this to two for a minute.
[05:49.24]Let's just see, I just wanna, okay, look.
[05:52.10]I'm not gonna play all through two.
[05:55.23]I just wanna peek at my Christmas presents for a second.
[05:59.04]You know, like, this is... Destroy All Humans 1... This is like going to the grocery store.
[06:04.76]And you buy, like, four boxes of cereal, right?
[06:08.91]And... Okay, Captain Crunch is in the cart.
[06:11.85]You've got Fruity Loops is in the cart.
[06:13.75]You've got Rice Krispos.
[06:15.21]And then you've got, um... Cocoa Crunch.
[06:18.39]Cocoa Krispies.
[06:19.87]Right?
[06:21.05]Just because you open... The Cocoa Krispies first... You know, it doesn't mean you're not gonna eat it all.
[06:27.85]You want to try all the cereals first.
[06:29.51]You want to eat 20% of all the cereals before you pick the cereal that you're going to eat long term.
[06:33.69]To empty the box.
[06:41.41]So we're going to... God damn it.
[06:44.83]I'm like so ADHD, man.
[06:47.27]Like I can't fucking finish anything.
[06:55.41]That's true.
[06:55.95]Yes, it is.
[06:58.63]Alright, let's just see two.
[07:02.41]No, no!
[07:04.01]No!
[07:05.63]No!
[07:07.49]Just play one.
[07:09.33]Do it.
[07:12.21]No, stop being bad.
[07:14.41]Play, it's right here.
[07:22.51]Oh, by the way, if you don't know, there are new emotes.
[07:26.62]There are at least three or four new emos.
[07:34.24]Let's go.
[07:34.74]Area 42, duck and cover.
[07:35.98]I'm ready.
[07:38.89]We've got Jerma-Jex, Jerma-Jex 2, Jerma-Mercury, and the golden artifact.
[07:45.33]Am I not playing Dark Souls Remastered?
[07:49.87]Because we're not there yet.
[07:55.76]Dark Souls Remastered is coming up soon.
[08:01.23]After we're done with Destroy All Humans.
[08:02.93]Might be like another stream.
[08:07.39]General Armquist, good of you to come.
[08:09.99]Thought you might be too busy running damage control out in California.
[08:14.76]Never too busy to watch the Air Force fall flat on its face, Jack.
[08:20.10]Corporal Patterson, let's show our guests what this bottle rocket can do.
[08:24.93]Yeah, but don't worry.
[08:25.97]I will stream Dark Souls Remastered.
[08:29.53]More than once.
[08:30.65]At least.
[08:30.95]Yeah, good morning.
[08:32.62]He's ready to invade me?
[08:35.72]I'm still fighting with what I'm going to play, though.
[08:57.29]I might not play it on PC.
[08:59.37]Oh my gosh, disintegrator.
[09:00.59]I like this thing.
[09:01.25]Maybe I should get in the chopper.
[09:02.95]Well, he just said the disintegrator ray.
[09:04.23]Oh.
[09:22.33]At this very moment they are preparing a nuclear device for testing it a nuclear nuclear device clear device That monkeys as good as dead take the ship I Don't think your arsenal is good enough, so take the take the ship Hello

[10:23.16]Well, that's inaccurate.
[10:24.66]Wowee!
[10:26.50]That's inaccurate.
[10:31.58]Why is it going so far over the thing's head?
[10:34.10]Not dead?
[11:00.85]This is too EU-friendly.
[11:03.49]Well, it's very... Yes, it's very EU-friendly.
[11:07.30]At least today.
[11:15.62]Whoa!
[11:17.76]Boy!
[11:17.88]Don't kill me!
[11:24.85]I gotta count how many times it takes to shoot them before they die.
[11:28.87]They can't see through the disguise.
[11:30.01]Let me go over here.
[11:32.76]Hypnotize the driver.
[11:33.70]No police awareness, that's extra points.
[11:37.22]Suck his brain out.
[11:38.52]Alright, hypnotize you.
[11:41.26]Drive the truck.
[11:42.27]And go explode it.
[12:03.22]Who do I support in the World Cup?
[12:05.65]Uh, Swansea City.
[12:14.57]They're a team, right?
[12:17.96]Let's score the truck.
[12:21.92]Truck's going kind of fast.
[12:23.14]I can't run behind the truck this fast.
[12:29.93]Don't mind me.
[12:30.63]I'm just going to follow behind.
[12:31.77]Open the gate.
[12:32.17]Wait, do I open the gate?
[12:34.36]Should I open this?
[12:35.12]Use this.
[12:40.62]Okay, why do I have to telepathically open the door?
[12:44.66]That's kind of...
[12:56.61]Shady.
[12:57.77]The guy- That's his job.
[13:00.63]Do your job, dude.
[13:01.73]Holy shit.

[13:36.68]Wait, don't, don't, don't, don't go yet, hold on.
[13:40.34]Okay, go.
[13:42.20]What else is in the way?
[13:43.50]This box is in the way.
[13:44.78]For real?
[13:47.48]You can't just drive by the box.
[13:50.88]This guy's a terrible driver.
[13:53.33]Those lactating bovoids are blocking the road up ahead.
[13:57.59]So drive into them.
[13:59.21]It's not that hard.
[14:07.38]You could easily just avoid these cows.
[14:10.52]You don't have to drive on the street.
[14:12.02]Don't you know?
[14:12.50]What are you, a GPS device?
[14:23.77]Like, right now, if this is me driving, you could weave through.
[14:25.95]I don't have to kill all these animals.
[14:32.59]Unnecessary.
[14:38.28]He's driving around a nuke.
[14:41.72]Yeah, well... Oh, shit!
[14:46.14]That thing's gonna shoot at me.
[14:48.92]What is he crashing into?
[14:53.71]Oh, shit.

[21:03.31]I just skimmed that guy.
[21:11.64]That's clean to pull with that guy's body.
[21:16.56]There are so many people around here.
[21:18.30]Like... Oh, fuck.
[21:27.79]I love my country.
[21:29.03]I love my flag.

[21:45.15]I'm gonna go out of my mind Alright go open the door Open gate Should I pick it up and put it over the gate?
[22:08.42]I don't know what he wants me to do.
[22:09.66]There's a thing I can open, right?
[22:12.96]I can't look through there.
[22:20.47]Open sesame.
[22:22.75]The thing to open is... I think I'm going to have to jump around and do it.
[22:25.59]I have to get over there.
[22:31.42]On the other side.
[22:33.40]I mean, fly over is easier said than done.
[22:34.94]There's a SAM site right here that'll...
[22:37.81]Absolutely light me up, so I need to run around this thing alright.
[22:40.31]Can you please get off this guy's body?
[22:43.61]Get off this guy suit yourself.

[23:05.23]Oh, this is bad.
[23:06.03]I have to
[23:08.91]What about the other side?
[23:09.57]Is there a site on the other side too?
[23:11.85]That one's further away.
[23:13.41]Mind control somebody to press the button?
[23:19.51]There's nobody on the other side of the fence that can do it.
[23:23.11]I'm gonna have to go over here.
[23:25.57]Straight into there.
[23:26.49]Maybe not.
[23:28.41]Let's see.
[23:35.00]I could lob a grenade over here and take that out.
[23:40.41]I'm going to try this.
[23:41.07]Let's get over the fence here.
[23:43.36]Far enough away from the same site.
[23:47.08]Just jump over.
[23:49.44]Those things, those missiles kill you in like one shot.
[23:53.14]I ain't fucking around there.
[23:54.00]I need to steal the disguise now.
[23:55.08]I'm in.
[24:01.27]Where's this guy?
[24:02.75]I'm in there.
[24:04.35]Watch out for that tank.
[24:05.79]There's not some guy taking a piss over here.
[24:09.62]There's a lot of this.
[24:10.30]Here we go, right there.
[24:26.15]Got it.
[24:29.46]Alright.
[24:29.78]Problem solved.
[24:32.93]Does the game have tank controls?
[24:34.43]Uh, no.
[24:34.59]OH SHIT!
[24:34.99]I'm reading the chat!
[24:36.33]I'm never reading chat again!
[25:11.20]Get the fuck outta here.
[25:13.54]What was that sound?
[25:14.24]I gotta pick him up.
[25:16.33]Okay.
[25:16.43]Open that up.
[25:18.93]Use it.
[25:38.85]Alright, come on in.
[25:41.10]That was a lot sloppier than it needed to be.
[25:53.88]Fuck you.
[25:58.27]I got that guy run over good.
[26:00.65]Exactly what I wanted.
[26:01.49]They don't know it's me.
[26:05.35]How can that guy see me?
[26:06.95]He should not be able to.
[26:08.60]Why won't those commies invade already?
[26:10.62]I wanna shoot me some reds!
[26:11.78]Alright, we're fine.
[26:17.80]Just watch out for the guys in the suits.
[26:19.10]March here, march there, march it yourself, jerk-off!
[26:26.96]Couldn't I have done that from the other side of the fence?
[26:31.04]No.
[26:31.30]You can't target somebody on the other side of the fence.
[26:34.12]You can't hold it.
[26:35.00]Alright, so what's the deal here?
[26:36.79]T-minus.
[26:37.43]Defend the atomic bomb.
[26:41.59]Okay.
[26:42.69]Okay.
[26:43.23]Okay.
[26:43.59]So defend the atomic bomb.
[26:44.97]Okay.
[26:45.51]What are these guys doing?
[26:52.11]Get out of here.
[26:55.01]Did I fail?
[26:59.73]Huh?
[27:00.59]No!
[27:01.38]What?
[27:01.78]No, come on!
[27:02.82]What?
[27:03.68]I... Oh, I didn't... Oh, no, man.
[27:12.36]Oh, man.
[27:13.56]What the fuck?
[27:19.87]Oh, my fucking God.
[27:22.69]How was I supposed to know that was what was happening?
[27:26.92]Defend the bomb and two guys are just looking at it and you lose the mission.
[27:38.77]God fucking damn it.
[27:39.91]I have to restart the entire mission.
[27:52.46]don't let anybody touch it well I mean I usually they like the soldiers the ones shooting at stuff and come it's been a soldier like every time oh god damn it man that's so irritating literally like a two second mistake I have to do like a 35 minute mission
[28:19.71]Armquist is inspecting one of their primitive aeronautical contraptions inside the military base.
[28:25.61]This could be an excellent chance to crush their pitiful air defense forces and destroy Armquist once and for all.
[28:32.85]If only there were purple indicators.
[28:34.24]Yeah, but still, like... It doesn't matter.
[28:37.76]I wasn't fast enough to kill them anyway.
[28:39.78]I'm gonna die.
[28:40.20]Trying to play the second game.
[28:49.00]No, not yet.
[28:51.39]I'm just gonna try to do this as fast as I can.
[28:57.97]Just like GTA, there are no- no, there are no checkpoints.
[29:00.67]You have to do the entire thing over again.
[29:02.49]It's just like old-school, like, Grand Theft Auto.
[29:08.53]I need to have a disguise.
[29:18.74]Can I get him from back here?
[29:22.72]I'm going to do this quick.
[29:26.78]Drive the truck.
[29:28.58]Just going to run over there as fast as I can.
[29:33.23]Am I doing a double stream today?
[29:36.85]No.
[29:37.45]I'm going to be on the official podcast later, so I can't stream later.
[29:49.00]Open the door.
[29:49.70]Go, go, go, go, go.
[29:50.34]Move the truck.
[30:20.86]God if that came back and hit me up It almost did I was about to fucking have a meltdown.
[30:25.99]I was about to be very angry.
[30:30.19]Oh God damn it man If that came back and crushed me you would have seen real fucking anger I would have quit the game for sure I got full disintegrated right?
[30:46.41]Yeah
[30:49.23]Oh shit.
[30:52.21]Don't you dare.
[30:53.37]I forgot to take this out.
[31:01.50]Kill it.
[31:01.88]Come on.
[31:03.92]There's another one that I didn't kill.
[31:04.92]It's hanging out over here.
[31:07.64]A little bit further out.
[31:16.40]Move, move, move.
[31:28.01]Alright, go.
[31:34.29]That's an anal probe.
[31:35.03]That ain't going to reach.
[31:40.78]Alright, go.
[31:48.32]How did I get in touch with those guys?
[31:51.06]I just kind of hit them up on Twitter.
[31:53.55]Apparently we've both been interested for like a year and we just never like really talked I don't know if anybody here was recommending or talking to them or anything, but It should be fun looking forward to it
[32:22.40]Brass always bust my chops, jackasses.
[32:26.08]Those rocks are blocking the road up ahead.
[32:28.24]Alright, this is the painful thing.
[32:35.70]So, those rocks.
[32:40.05]Man with the rocks.
[32:41.17]Her name is Sue.
[32:47.23]They're ready to talk about masturbation.
[32:49.95]What's going on?
[32:50.75]What's that?
[32:53.43]I don't know.
[32:54.35]I just don't feel like I'm being all I can be.
[32:58.71]Is that like a form of poetry or something?
[33:03.11]I want to be just like Sergeant York or Gomer Pyle.
[33:09.50]I've been on duty too long.
[33:13.02]Armquist is my hero.
[33:15.68]My pappy fought in the big one.
[33:18.97]You good?
[33:20.23]You're not good.
[33:20.71]Okay.
[33:24.34]Sort of.
[33:25.70]That guy just fell.
[33:26.84]Yeah, he fell down though.
[33:28.62]He did like a slide.
[33:29.72]That was fun.
[33:32.04]Still in the way.
[33:38.57]This guy's in the way.
[33:39.17]Alright, move.
[33:40.79]Move so I don't have to do the escort mission again.
[33:42.77]I really hope I don't blow this.
[33:45.73]Judging by how much I'm trying to rush through this, I probably will.
[33:51.63]I don't even worry about a go.
[33:55.71]Now I'll get rid of the mines.
[33:58.55]Remember this part?
[33:59.17]We laughed at this part.
[34:00.06]This part was funny.
[34:01.00]Remember how funny this was?
[34:03.40]Let's laugh at it again.
[34:06.70]What a good time to laugh.
[34:12.85]It plays out every side it's plays out the same way every time Mistake I Can't make this mistake again.
[34:17.73]Alright, but first of all, hold on I
[34:40.11]I can't.
[34:40.97]I need to destroy all this shit.
[34:42.63]Let's make this quick.
[34:50.81]God damn it.
[34:52.13]God damn it!
[34:53.86]Why?
[34:55.00]Blow it up!
[34:55.68]Why?
[34:56.38]That wasn't my fault.
[34:57.84]That wasn't my fault.
[34:58.74]You understand that wasn't my fault?
[35:20.75]That's one more.
[35:22.57]He drove over this one last time.
[35:23.75]It's alright.
[35:30.83]Give me the stupid thing.
[35:35.92]Is this the lag?
[35:37.02]No.
[35:39.50]It'll always be.
[35:40.62]The excuse will always be the same excuse.
[35:43.62]And that is right analog aiming.
[35:45.98]It'll be the excuse every time.
[35:47.22]I don't even need to say anything.
[35:49.02]You guys already know what it is.
[35:54.63]Okay, here we go again.
[35:56.47]This was so hard to even get in here in the first place.
[36:00.43]Get out of the way.
[36:01.07]I got a ball, right?
[36:02.05]Didn't miss any of them?
[36:16.27]No, I didn't.
[36:16.97]It's alright.
[36:17.43]He's going to drive up with the same one.
[36:18.69]We're going to... It's funny.
[36:20.49]He got it.
[36:22.12]Nice work.
[36:23.96]He just can't drive up with all of them.
[36:25.56]That's all that matters.
[36:27.16]Watch out.
[36:27.62]There's one dude over here.
[36:28.40]What's up?
[36:28.76]These idiots.
[36:41.76]Same deal.
[36:44.75]Down this way.
[36:45.47]You really can't make any mistakes.
[36:53.11]Make sure I tell those guys that I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream to impress them.
[36:57.37]That's the first thing I'm gonna say.
[37:03.06]And I'm gonna hold out the hand with the ring on it.
[37:04.94]You know what I mean?
[37:10.65]I'm the only guy that's ever done that, so it would make sense.
[37:13.07]It's pretty impressive.
[37:18.28]You know, by the way, rings are fucking annoying, aren't they?
[37:23.28]Big rings?
[37:23.96]Why would you ever want a huge ring?
[37:30.53]That's no- that sucks.
[37:32.35]It's just a big weight on your finger.
[37:36.43]Doesn't really do anything.
[37:37.61]March here.
[37:38.37]March there.
[37:39.17]March it yourself, jerk-off.
[37:41.75]Here we go.
[37:42.87]Watch out for the men in black.
[37:48.25]I walked right into a guy.
[37:50.85]He was hidden by every line of sight.
[37:52.48]Man, do I hate marching.
[37:57.84]These boots suck.
[38:03.19]It's uncomfortable.
[38:03.81]That's why I never want to get married.
[38:06.39]I can't wear rings.
[38:11.75]I'm sorry, my future wife.
[38:13.78]I don't wear them.
[38:14.38]I can't do it.
[38:14.72]Can't we just sign an agreement and that's it?
[38:20.42]Now this guy has to get out of the way.
[38:21.70]I'm going to go out of my mind.
[38:33.93]Here we go.
[38:35.91]This is where I got to last time.
[38:38.19]Kill the scientists.
[38:39.95]You do that in a divorce.
[38:41.25]I don't even want to get that far.
[38:49.36]What the hell's wrong with Fuchsia?
[38:58.46]My marriage is going to be so strange.
[39:04.25]You know how Jennifer Lopez apparently has a list of demands?
[39:07.43]Like, only green M&Ms are allowed near her?
[39:10.93]It's going to get weird shit like that for my marriage clause.
[39:14.81]I'm going to have a series of 200 demands that need to be met.
[39:28.57]I didn't have to do it.
[39:29.63]They did.
[39:30.79]Here we go.
[39:31.37]Here we go.
[39:31.65]Here we go.
[39:31.91]Here we go.
[39:33.61]Scientist.
[39:45.69]Who's next?
[39:47.61]Where did you come from?
[40:00.15]We're good.
[40:01.53]So far.
[40:03.41]What?
[40:08.21]That's it?
[40:10.49]It's gonna leave?
[40:11.83]How big is this blast radius?
[40:13.88]I don't know how big the blast radius is.
[40:29.63]It's got to be a huge part of this map, right?
[40:31.93]No, I was trying to hit that guy.
[40:36.71]Goodbye.
[40:37.15]Goodbye.
[40:38.25]Ooh.
[40:38.69]Got it.
[40:57.32]I needed to find a place to go over.
[40:59.49]I couldn't just do that.
[41:00.61]I would've gotten shot.
[41:01.23]I would've gotten lit up.
[41:02.07]I'm not repeating this whole mission.
[41:05.20]If that didn't work, I would've just peed out my window and entered this room.
[41:15.39]Armquist, you want to explain to me why our troops are abandoning Area 42?
[41:20.50]They're not leaving, they're regrouping.
[41:24.22]Everything's under control.
[41:25.87]Really?
[41:26.87]So the airfield hasn't been destroyed by one of our own nukes?
[41:31.18]It's that communist spy from Santa Modesta.
[41:34.25]He got in somehow, messed with one of our experiments.
[41:36.87]Don't worry, I'll catch him.
[41:38.89]That's what you said in Santa Modesta.
[41:41.91]Frankly, General, I'm beginning to question your resolve.
[41:45.96]Oh, I'm resolved, alright.
[41:48.66]That explosion was meant to take me out.
[41:51.02]You're saying this communist spy has a...
[41:54.63]It's right there.
[41:55.55]There's nobody over here.
[41:56.61]It's not going to bother anybody.
[41:57.63]I could just be... I could take the screen off and shoot right there.
[42:00.29]I'm going to get fined?
[42:01.05]Why would I get fined?
[42:01.57]It's just like bushes and trees over here.
[42:02.77]There's nothing over here.
[42:26.04]And look, if somebody wants to complain about it, I'll just blame it on somebody's dog.
[42:31.90]Yeah, beginning word that there's a lot of pee spots all over the place on this side of the apartment building.
[42:39.89]Ah, it's probably somebody's dog.
[42:41.09]And I'll write up a thing, a huge essay explaining, like, guys, we have rules here for a reason.
[42:48.95]To make sure I can cloak the fact that it's me.
[42:54.67]We did it.
[42:55.07]Airfield destroyed.
[43:06.55]Good.
[43:08.19]What if they have video evidence?
[43:09.43]Good luck.
[43:11.37]Because I'm always wearing a ski mask.
[43:13.59]So... How are you going to know it's me?
[43:21.24]New mission.
[43:23.30]How much DNA do I have?
[43:31.46]675.
[43:33.72]I love this ski mask.
[43:40.16]It really is such a funny... It's a funny piece of clothing.
[43:45.25]Here's the detonator.
[43:46.93]Where's the... This is what I want.
[43:51.35]I don't want to spend any money right now.
[43:55.25]Because you're pissing out your window, so you're in your place.
[43:59.33]They would know it was you.
[44:02.01]I'm wearing a crime mask, like a ski mask.
[44:05.65]If you took a picture of me peeing out my window with a ski mask on, naked, I could just easily say, oh, somebody broke into my fucking house.
[44:16.53]They threw my table over and threw my clothes everywhere and were looking for something.
[44:21.93]That's fucked up.
[44:34.39]No one breaks into a house with a ski mask on to pee out the window.
[44:37.65]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[44:39.61]I will make sure, before the police get there, I will, like, turn my desk over.
[44:43.96]I will, like, I'll take a single plate, and I'll just drop it on the ground so it just goes like, kink!
[44:50.56]Yeah, oh, this is crazy!
[44:53.31]This is, uh, sure, did anything happen here?
[44:56.45]Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[44:57.69]And I had, like, I had, like, five grand in cash here.
[45:02.50]Who's going to replace that?
[45:03.86]How am I going to get that back?
[45:14.90]What about fingerprints?
[45:17.20]I open and close my window all the time.
[45:19.56]Of course my fingerprints are going to be on there.
[45:21.18]And guess what?
[45:21.76]He was wearing gloves.
[45:23.65]And I wear gloves in the house all day too.
[45:29.19]Press R2 button to cycle to the quantum deconstructor.
[45:33.40]Sit back and watch the havoc.
[45:34.80]Okay.
[45:38.70]I have a new item.
[45:44.08]Quantum Deconstructor.
[45:49.36]Is it like a bomb?
[45:50.10]Let's see what it does.
[45:54.68]Well, that's very big.
[45:55.86]That works.
[46:09.39]I'm getting lit up here.
[46:13.83]Oh, Sonic Boom.
[46:16.41]I think this is my favorite weapon.
[46:17.43]I want to upgrade to Sonic Boom the most.
[46:23.49]Ow.
[46:24.54]I'm getting kind of destroyed here.
[46:30.08]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[46:31.32]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[46:34.84]Oh my god, there's so many of these things.
[46:36.48]None of this is health?
[46:50.41]Oh boy.
[46:50.91]Oh boy, run away.
[46:57.27]Take out the Town Hall.
[46:58.87]One more hit and I'm dead.
[47:08.67]Almost dead.
[47:09.21]Need health.
[47:13.02]Bad.
[47:13.28]Bad.
[47:13.94]Very bad.
[47:17.68]Very bad.
[47:21.41]Come on, let's help from the horizon somewhere.
[47:22.75]Over here?
[47:23.05]It's always like on the outskirts.
[47:25.39]Got one more nuke to drop.
[47:28.72]Oh!
[47:32.86]There it goes.
[47:33.40]Try it again.
[47:44.32]Just destroy the SAMs?
[47:45.27]Well, it's kind of hard when there are like a hundred of them.
[47:56.86]Yeah, I know how it works.
[47:58.72]What am I bumping into?
[48:00.22]Okay.
[48:32.92]Damn it.
[48:33.34]God damn it!
[48:34.14]Did we kill her?
[49:05.00]God, Jesus Christ.
[49:08.36]I'm almost dead again.
[49:14.85]There's no time limit here.
[49:31.86]I'm so bad.
[49:32.84]I don't understand how.
[49:35.87]This is like fucking hard.
[49:37.13]This is not easy to do this.
[49:47.91]What is that?
[50:00.47]This side over here.
[50:01.51]Get that tank not dead.
[50:03.99]Come on.
[50:08.43]Just getting rid of the tactical ammo.
[50:16.06]Jesus Christ!
[50:23.16]It's just everywhere!
[50:25.64]This shit is everywhere!
[50:32.62]I gotta back off.
[50:33.46]I wish I could turn the camera a little.
[50:36.55]Christ.
[50:37.39]There's one underneath me here.
[50:45.45]Is it a boat?
[51:04.54]Any more of those sites right here?
[51:05.62]I know there's one right here somewhere.
[51:07.60]Right there.
[51:11.49]Come on, hit it!
[51:17.99]Aye yai yai.
[51:26.21]Almost dead again.
[51:32.31]No health.
[51:35.60]I'm out of health.
[51:36.42]I need to find some help before I do anything else.
[51:47.61]That's not health, that's Sonic Boom.
[51:51.55]And here's, same sights everywhere and tanks.
[51:53.77]Yeah, yep, there's health.
[52:07.72]Three more buildings four more buildings or so
[52:45.20]Is that a site right there?
[52:46.12]No.
[52:51.50]I'm going all the way around.
[52:52.84]I'm not going to get picked off by some fucking tank.
[52:59.95]Didn't get it with that, did I?
[53:08.07]Is this the last?
[53:12.07]Hell, there we go.
[53:12.77]Alright, now I'm not afraid anymore.
[53:23.10]I'm no longer afraid.
[53:24.24]Time to just get it.
[53:29.16]Stop blocking me.
[53:36.78]This is getting a lot harder.
[53:47.84]Let's destroy the buildings.
[53:50.00]You're gonna die from the SAM sites.
[53:52.52]It takes like two or three rockets for the ship to explode.
[54:07.79]Jesus Christ, guys.
[54:10.27]Destroy the SAM sites.
[54:11.42]What are you doing?
[54:12.02]You're an idiot.
[54:13.98]Does that.
[54:14.72]What the fuck are you doing?
[54:15.64]You're stupid.
[54:16.24]Just destroy the buildings, dumbass.
[54:19.33]What?
[54:19.69]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[54:26.65]I'm gonna go down here.
[54:43.72]Streamer mad.
[54:45.80]No, you guys are like democratically split in half as to how to achieve every mission.
[54:56.42]Alright, let's do this one over here.
[55:16.44]There are too many of these guys.
[55:17.70]They're everywhere.
[55:20.00]I probably actually should just... I'm going to go back to the mothership.
[55:23.70]Because it's at like six stars right now.
[55:34.57]Democratic isn't the word I wanted.
[55:36.01]Yeah, because half of you guys want it one way and half of you guys want it the other.
[55:41.00]And then you end up running into each other, and nothing ever gets done.
[55:44.49]Because then the stream president goes, fuck, what the fuck does anybody want right now?
[55:51.41]I'm just going to sign a bill and see what people think.
[55:58.14]Let's go over here.
[56:14.26]He actually is a communist?
[56:15.83]What?
[56:16.21]No, I'm not.
[56:19.53]I'm a fapitalist.
[56:24.57]Oh, fucking sorry.
[56:25.97]Somebody said masturbation, and now, like, I fucked it all up.
[56:38.35]I was, like, a terrible joke.
[56:42.12]Shit.
[56:53.08]I'm supposed to be preparing for the podcast.
[56:54.94]That's what you guys told me to do.
[56:56.06]I'm just going this way.
[57:34.35]So, the stream's not going to be very long, by the way.
[57:36.31]Because... I still need to eat.
[58:03.20]Let's do this.
[58:08.38]Destroy humans of the female variety.
[58:14.00]I should take out the... This is easier.
[58:22.16]There's a zapper.
[58:23.82]Oh, that is too.
[58:27.08]Female, female.
[58:27.76]Come here, come here, come here.
[58:29.30]Seven.
[58:31.58]Chain it together, pig.
[58:32.36]Ten, eleven.
[58:36.23]Ten, eleven.
[58:48.08]Or... 200.
[58:48.52]288, thank you.
[58:48.84]Now let's start sucking brains out.
[58:50.08]I'm gonna sit here and harvest.
[58:51.38]Ow.
[58:51.48]I thought the guy was holding a fire axe.
[59:22.01]Hold on now.
[59:22.51]Wait for the recharge.
[59:23.23]Come here, sir.
[59:24.47]I need more than this, that's for sure.
[59:26.93]Wow.
[59:27.03]Good lord!
[59:27.39]It's an alien!
[59:51.89]I need bigger brains.
[59:55.28]That's a tank.
[59:57.14]What other things are on screen, Jeremy?
[59:59.28]What do you think?
[59:59.96]I'm gonna get air shot here.
[60:11.35]Not gonna be good.
[60:19.49]I really should just walk around and collect those things.
[60:24.75]They give the most.
[60:29.31]Scientists have a lot of brain, yeah.
[60:31.87]They got 50 DNA from the scientists.
[60:33.87]Jesus.
[60:34.37]Alright.
[60:35.65]High level threat!
[60:36.85]Take down with deadly force!
[60:38.73]Enemy is small, green, and temperamental!
[60:45.53]Oh, I'm dead.
[60:47.13]Nope, not quite.
[60:48.68]Yes, I am.
[60:49.10]I just killed myself with my own grenade.
[60:52.70]How am I still alive?
[60:54.60]I don't understand.
[60:55.30]Maybe.
[60:56.12]Okay, whatever.
[60:56.72]My gun collapsed.
[61:02.45]Great.
[61:03.45]You finally got the alien.
[61:12.56]I think I can do the upgrade though you know what they say about a furon with a really big cranium back to area 42
[61:57.76]All my DNA is gone because I used it.
[62:00.64]I thought that was just you had to get to like a milestone.
[62:03.24]I didn't know it actually spent it for the missions.
[62:07.73]I thought it was just you had to collect that amount, not you have to use it to go to the mission.
[62:23.79]Well.
[62:29.76]I wonder if I can just start harvesting.
[62:31.36]Oh man.
[62:32.60]What does this thing even do?
[62:38.82]I want to see what the fuck this does.
[62:43.22]Can I like pull them up into the saucer?
[62:48.80]No, you can't scroll around.
[62:51.80]Eventually you, I guess you can pick up anything.
[62:53.60]Alright, I'm going to land over here.
[63:13.13]Are there free DNA cheats?
[63:14.42]I don't want to cheat, though.
[63:16.86]Not now.
[63:17.86]This is the first game I don't really want to... Because once you use cheats, you can never go back.
[63:25.56]Ever.
[63:30.34]It's never, never the same.
[63:33.30]What are the four icons?
[63:39.97]The four icons are your wanted level, essentially.
[63:55.49]Do it.
[63:58.33]Well, this is much better.
[64:00.51]I need to stop pulling DNA, though.
[64:14.83]Well, okay.
[64:16.43]And there's that.
[64:20.45]Oh, boy, these things are just littered across this whole horizon, huh?
[64:26.13]Apparently.
[64:26.75]If I wanted to... I mean, I like this game.
[64:30.81]It's just not like I'm going to skip the whole thing.
[64:35.93]Only 175 DNA to run around and get the checkpoints.
[64:51.84]These aren't really increasing, are they?
[64:53.50]I'm noticing that.
[64:58.80]All these things are always like 100 DNA, 200 DNA.
[65:02.53]Wish they would increase in value.
[65:04.75]Second game is better?
[65:12.47]I've heard various conflicting things about 1 and 2.
[65:23.00]I've heard that one is way harder, but less fun.
[65:27.55]And two is very easy, but more open and interesting.
[65:31.99]Is what I've heard.
[65:33.65]That's what the world has told me.
[65:45.94]And then the third one's not even worth playing.
[66:02.62]Two is better?
[66:03.18]Well, it depends on what you think is better.
[66:05.62]If you think more challenging is more fun than easy, I guess.
[66:13.25]They've had these really spread out and dangerous places, huh?
[66:15.57]But 175 DNA?
[66:16.57]It's just better.
[66:28.58]Well, regardless of where we get to on this stream, we'll be starting to... I'm going to do... I'll probably start... I want to play Dark Souls.
[66:38.40]I just do.
[66:38.76]I've been getting the itch for it lately.
[66:41.69]I want to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[66:44.87]After today, and maybe tomorrow, we might play... I was going to say Demon Humans.
[66:52.61]That's not a game.
[66:54.63]That's not even remotely what this game is.
[67:00.58]After tomorrow, we'll probably start and try to complete Dark Souls.
[67:11.13]Jesus, man.
[67:14.17]175 goddamn DNA!
[67:15.09]This is like fucking impossible!
[67:20.37]You put me in like the fucking most dangerous places in the whole map!
[67:28.54]Look, I just got, I just got like almost half of this entire mission.
[67:31.60]Picking up a goddamn robot.
[67:34.42]Ah!
[68:14.69]I might as well just do him here.
[68:16.11]You know what I mean?
[68:16.67]Like, this is the first level, right?
[68:19.05]If it's the same DNA for a brainless fucking mission.
[68:23.53]You literally walk in a circle in this mission.
[68:26.62]If it's the same amount of DNA, that's horseshit.
[68:34.54]That should be fucking a thousand DNA if you did that other one.
[68:36.98]More.
[68:40.68]That's 200 DNA for that.
[68:53.71]What about this one?
[68:57.93]This is the race.
[68:58.81]Race of a minute and thirty seconds to save the same amount of DNA.
[69:04.03]There aren't even any police here.
[69:05.39]I could just do this like four times.
[69:08.31]You just have to jump around in a circle.
[69:22.83]I might just use the cheats because I feel like I'm fucked up.
[69:29.72]Please, what are the cheats?
[69:30.58]What are they?
[69:45.17]How do I cheat in the game?
[69:46.97]I'm just gonna give myself a thousand DNA, that's it.
[69:49.55]I'm gonna have to look him up.
[70:00.40]I'm only doing it once.
[70:05.44]Look at how easy this was in comparison to the last one.
[70:14.88]I could do that again right now for another 175.
[70:16.55]It's avoiding farming.
[70:24.79]Can I just do that again?
[70:25.67]I can.
[70:26.45]I can just do that.
[70:27.81]I could probably do it like two more times.
[70:38.38]I could also just farm these people and just pull their brains out, right?
[70:42.16]Although none of them are that smart.
[70:47.22]That's really good!
[70:51.10]This is good!
[70:51.80]That's 50 DNA!
[70:52.24]That didn't even do anything!
[70:59.07]Come here.
[70:59.65]You know, I'd like to select the guy that's standing here, not everything behind him.
[71:16.72]Alright, I found what I'm doing.
[71:25.65]You took a shit?
[71:26.23]What'd you miss?
[71:26.71]Not much.
[71:38.76]What was the stream?
[71:39.66]Length command?
[71:41.88]Um...
[71:44.11]Collect four brain stems, it's just easy, free.
[71:52.59]I'm not even gonna need the board, I'm already gonna be done.
[72:01.80]I'll get it in a second here.
[72:08.29]One more brain stem, there it is.
[72:13.93]Duck into the ship?
[72:15.27]I don't think I have that ability yet.
[72:17.49]I can pull them, but I can't seem to pull them up.
[72:19.83]I just tether them and can throw them around.
[72:22.82]Unless there's another button I have to press that I'm not pressing.
[72:27.38]Did I already get rid of everybody?
[72:28.38]There's got to be one more person, right?
[72:30.69]We got the outhouse.
[72:36.25]Almost there.
[72:37.35]No, this guy!
[72:38.03]The guy right here!
[72:39.15]Stop targeting the fucking cows!
[72:40.99]AHH!
[73:04.47]I'm not going to use it on upgrades.
[73:06.91]I've learned that lesson the hard way.
[73:08.21]No, I don't want to do that.
[73:16.33]Let's do the destroy the town one.
[73:17.43]It's 200.
[73:24.19]200, destroy everything.
[73:30.03]I got plenty of upgrades.
[73:30.85]I can just breeze through this.
[73:41.58]Alright, let's destroy everything one two three Two one shot or two with this
[74:13.32]That's so long to do it to.
[74:17.46]I got rid of the troll face emote?
[74:19.74]No, it's still there.
[74:21.67]And that's not a troll face.
[74:23.01]Well, you know what?
[74:25.99]Fuck it.
[74:26.29]It is.
[74:26.75]Sure.
[74:27.65]It is.
[74:31.75]It's whatever you want it to be.
[74:32.91]How's that sound?
[74:56.15]Last one.
[75:01.23]That's beautiful.
[75:02.11]Elastic surgery.
[75:08.81]Good work, Crypto!
[75:15.61]Oh god.
[75:17.73]I only need 500 more and this nightmare can be over.
[75:41.68]No, I'm not cheating.
[75:42.86]I don't need to.
[75:45.98]I don't need to cheat.
[75:47.50]I don't have to.
[75:49.94]We're almost there.
[75:51.22]By the time I look up on IGN.com what the cheats are for this game, I'll have already collected it.
[75:57.80]It's going to take me 30 minutes to do that.
[76:03.47]You know how long it takes to load a website?
[76:05.13]This is 2005 we're talking.
[76:08.37]This is like 56k modems people were still using.
[76:23.02]I think the timer is going down.
[76:34.37]I should play Dota?
[76:37.98]Why on Earth did you want me to play Dota?
[76:39.70]Play Dota?
[76:56.65]Oh shit!
[76:57.49]That's almost over!
[76:59.15]I'm not fast enough to get this.
[77:01.58]No, I don't think I'm fast enough.
[77:04.96]No?
[77:06.78]I think I need to get like speed upgrades or something.
[77:11.96]I'm not fast enough.
[77:17.24]I'm not playing Lego Racers.
[77:26.91]I need to increase jetpack or something.
[77:29.27]I'm not trying that again.
[77:30.11]I've already done it?
[77:34.63]Yeah, I've done it a few times.
[77:36.55]So it must get hard.
[77:37.65]Alright, let's go back to the ship.
[77:39.73]I'm going to try another area.
[77:40.79]Boop.
[77:59.08]Put the cheat in chat.
[78:02.43]No, don't start like copy pasting this shit.
[78:24.72]Okay, I did it.
[78:25.54]There you go.
[78:26.98]It's done.
[78:28.69]That's a thousand yen.
[78:29.77]Alright, I did it.
[78:30.53]Alright, stop spamming.
[78:31.83]I did it.
[78:32.25]I did it.
[78:33.01]Let's go.
[78:33.97]It's done.
[78:34.39]I inputted your Konami code.
[78:59.54]Sometimes you just have to, we didn't cheat.
[79:02.31]We sped up a little.
[79:03.25]That's how I'm gonna spit it.
[79:06.57]We just sped it up a little.
[79:11.80]We didn't cheat.
[79:27.71]I mean, I guess we cheated.
[79:29.72]Mind woozy.
[79:31.04]Vision blurred.
[79:32.38]Bladder bursting.
[79:33.66]Must get to a lavatory.
[79:36.90]Oh, my aching cranium.
[79:39.12]Crypto, you moron.
[79:41.26]First step is admit you've got a problem.
[79:44.70]Please, please tell me I'm alone.
[79:47.71]Oh, thank you.
[79:49.03]Great frontal lobes.
[79:51.13]But...
[79:51.89]Where in space am I?
[79:53.59]Some kind of primitive laboratory.
[79:56.15]A cage.
[79:57.69]And humans.
[79:59.23]I'm being held against my will.
[80:02.12]And not in the fun way.
[80:05.38]Oh, they touched me.
[80:07.02]I feel so dirty.
[80:08.44]Okay, okay, that's it.
[80:10.33]I'm getting out of here.
[80:11.61]Now.
[80:15.77]You want something?
[80:17.51]You know, I still don't get that magic eye thing.
[80:20.41]I can't see the damn dolphin.
[80:22.78]Turn off the cage for me, please.
[80:26.42]No weapons, right?
[80:27.18]They probably took them.
[80:32.25]So now let's be the doctor.
[80:37.41]It's that easy.
[80:42.39]No, I'm gonna suck his brain out.
[80:47.91]This guy has a lot of brain power.
[80:55.65]50, right?
[80:55.99]25?
[80:56.05]The other scientist had 50.
[80:57.18]You weren't a very good scientist, were you?
[81:00.30]Alright, back to the ship.
[81:03.24]Retrieve gun.
[81:09.97]How did you guys not go in the water?
[81:14.40]That guy just turned into a fish.
[81:32.68]Gun doesn't work?
[81:47.34]How would this guy know where it is?
[81:49.70]He's a dock worker.
[81:50.42]That was a pretty nice snake mouth.
[82:14.55]See ya.
[82:14.85]Alright, give me the power core.
[82:16.91]Oh, I don't have my jetpack.
[82:18.27]I can't... I can't just cheat.
[82:20.02]Is it in here?
[82:24.14]There it is.
[82:40.18]The humans must have recovered your ship locate your ship and steal it back I
[82:58.72]Scanning what do you know a lot of grunts around lately couldn't be commies in Uniontown?
[83:05.42]Good this information will help your ship much up for the guy and all workers pajamas The hell's in all those army crates coming over from Monroe Island ain't nothing there, but that old abandoned fort I
[83:26.79]Excellent.
[83:28.13]Keep scanning workers.
[83:32.03]You men, hightail it to the barge.
[83:36.37]That's funny.
[83:36.81]I thought my game was just breaking.
[83:40.65]Interesting.
[83:41.21]Ooh, fuck.
[84:05.57]I've been on duty too long.
[84:07.01]Here are the things.
[84:13.32]Is that guy alive still?
[84:19.42]What the hell's wrong with Fuchsia?
[84:26.61]My brain is getting weaker.
[84:29.07]Come on, give me some concentration juice, please.
[84:38.60]Can this guy fucking die?
[84:40.32]Will you get away from me?
[84:41.96]I can't go over there until this guy's dead.
[84:52.09]Finally.
[84:54.71]There's a Sam site over here.
[84:55.87]I can't just walk over here.
[84:57.23]There's three things over here like that.
[84:58.97]Oh!
[85:01.99]No, no, no!
[85:09.14]Oh!
[85:09.34]Alright.
[85:19.74]Oh, god!
[85:20.20]God damn it!
[85:23.47]Up playing with fire here, man.
[85:24.71]I have to wait until I fully charge because I can't scan anybody.
[85:29.99]Okay.
[85:31.35]Now go.
[85:37.47]I'm just playing chicken with rocket launchers and machine guns right now.
[85:41.67]Any men in black over here?
[85:42.87]Right there, but it's alright.
[85:48.58]I gotta get over this way.
[85:49.20]Hey, I'm here.
[85:49.74]Uh, hepatite.
[86:09.02]Start conversation.
[86:12.80]Lena Turner.
[86:14.34]Jane Russell.
[86:15.46]Threaten the driver.
[86:16.72]Marilyn.
[86:17.68]Marilyn.
[86:19.64]Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn.
[86:21.68]That's what the guy said.
[86:25.48]There we go.
[86:41.93]No, the time for fucking around in this game is at zero.
[86:46.85]It's fun to mess around sometimes, but if it starts you over at the very beginning, I don't want to do that.
[86:51.88]That's so funny.
[86:53.46]Is that Steve Blum?
[87:12.16]I mean, there's a lot of actors in this game that you probably recognize.
[87:16.64]Alright, I gotta go around.
[87:17.36]I gotta hug this wall.
[87:20.92]We gotta... I hope Lorraine don't find out about me and her sister at the wedding.
[87:31.70]Lorraine, don't find out about me.
[87:35.88]Scream.
[87:38.42]Uh-oh.
[87:39.50]What did I do with my gun?
[87:41.40]It's not in my holster.
[87:42.72]Not in my pants.
[87:44.82]Oh, it's in my hand.
[87:46.30]My DI sure is a mean son of a gun.
[87:49.46]Weave around here.
[87:50.34]Okay, there's two guys there.
[87:54.90]Can I go this way to avoid them?
[88:00.11]Maybe.
[88:02.09]I don't know.
[88:02.57]I just don't feel like I'm being all I can be.
[88:06.83]Yeah, I can.
[88:07.29]Alright.
[88:07.49]You can buy those two.
[88:11.51]Up this right staircase.
[88:13.61]Should lead us to where we need to be.
[88:20.97]I gotta scan somebody.
[88:22.95]Quickly.
[88:23.39]Like, right now?
[88:24.67]Crane.
[88:24.87]Crane worker.
[88:25.35]Free the ship.
[88:41.59]Important updates are pending.
[88:42.89]Don't do it.
[88:46.97]That was quick.
[88:49.37]My computer almost restarted.
[88:57.79]What would Brando do?
[88:59.91]Stella!
[89:01.47]Stella!
[89:04.37]I mean, I could just run in there, but it's going to be these two idiots right here.
[89:13.61]Something's wrong with this ship.
[89:15.33]I can't take off the humans have removed the power cells from the ships I've detected the radiation signature of the energy cells coming from a human marine transport vessel near your location So back it up But my body says Brando Monty just ain't no rebel without a cause driving a street desire on the waterfront I
[89:40.31]I feel like that wasn't supposed to happen.
[89:41.59]I don't know.
[89:43.67]I'm confused.
[89:45.77]Oh.
[89:52.15]No.
[89:55.26]I was supposed to do that.
[89:58.02]Can I jump over this?
[89:58.74]I don't have a... Okay.
[90:01.50]Just a little single thing.
[90:02.46]Alright.
[90:03.90]Now there's two this way.
[90:05.71]Get over that.
[90:10.13]Hide among playing sight.
[90:14.30]How far away are these?
[90:23.56]Okay, I gotta get in the ship then.
[90:25.92]Those things are across the entire map.
[90:31.94]Why does Joe keep looking at me?
[90:33.26]He can't wish I'd brought my slicker.
[90:36.28]Of course, I could use a shower.
[90:40.32]I wonder if I can just... Can I get in?
[90:54.57]No.
[90:56.43]So I have to run all the way around and get that?
[90:58.63]I'm so confused right now.
[91:04.37]Can I see the whole map?
[91:07.45]No, I can't.
[91:15.13]So I can't take off Please oh fucking god Where's that huge dude, he's like over there
[91:51.99]There's two.
[91:53.57]So now how do I get these?
[91:57.04]These are just gone.
[91:58.90]They're just all the way out here.
[91:59.98]In the ocean.
[92:02.50]I can't fly it.
[92:03.18]So I have to go all the way around.
[92:23.20]Interesting.
[92:23.74]Can I take the boat?
[92:37.22]I don't know.
[92:39.84]That's a good question.
[92:40.62]Let's see if I can just get down from here.
[92:54.62]Oh, okay.
[92:55.30]I gotta, no, I gotta go all the way across.
[92:56.94]I guess we have to go this way.
[93:01.56]I'm gonna fall in this goddamn water.
[93:09.19]I can already tell you.
[93:10.19]I'm gonna fall in this water and it's gonna be, I'm gonna be so angry.
[93:15.21]It's gonna be so unhappy.
[93:19.21]Why am I saying it's gonna be so unhappy?
[93:27.15]Worst possible place for me to land!
[93:34.48]That was the worst place I could have gone.
[93:37.42]Alright.
[93:37.72]Be easy.
[94:05.19]Yeah.
[94:06.99]Bye, guys.
[94:07.91]You think you need more coffee?
[94:12.77]I could use some more coffee, too.
[94:15.65]I really should just get more coffee.
[94:21.19]I hear noises.
[94:21.83]Okay, it's right there.
[94:24.83]Can I get it right on the tip of the... I guess I can.
[94:35.04]Is that the only one?
[94:37.22]I hope so.
[94:38.81]Yeah, we're good.
[94:47.25]I'm so paranoid right now.
[94:50.91]Yeah, there's more people up there.
[94:56.18]Don't detonate that.
[94:57.08]Don't detonate that.
[94:57.90]Not yet.
[94:59.24]Now detonate.
[94:59.82]Okay, now get back to work.
[95:07.55]Can't answer that phone.
[95:13.27]I'm sorry.
[95:14.59]Whoever it is, I'm gonna have to reach you another time.
[95:22.92]Can't even take my hands off.
[95:25.70]Alright, is there like one of those devices?
[95:27.90]I knew it.
[95:28.38]Yeah, I was gonna get shot if I jumped over on that boat.
[95:36.06]David, I can't go over there.
[95:38.56]We're good.
[95:41.74]Answer me.
[95:42.32]No, I can't answer it.
[95:46.18]Alright.
[95:46.66]I'm gonna bump my head.
[95:48.97]I'm so scared.
[95:49.95]This is exactly why.
[96:02.31]Okay.
[96:02.93]Time to leave.
[96:04.39]Dude, this is slow.
[96:05.99]I don't want to do this again.
[96:15.48]What if they've fallen and they can't get up?
[96:19.22]They'll figure it out.
[96:21.28]They'll find a way.
[96:25.12]You can dig both your palms into the ground and slide and crawl.
[96:31.91]Don't worry.
[96:32.63]Anybody that I know that would have a problem like that, there's a phone in every room.
[96:36.11]On the ground.
[96:36.59]Do you want to like sell... Oh, I've fallen and I can't get up.
[96:39.83]I need this thing on my wrist that's like $50 a month.
[96:43.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[96:44.39]Just go to Walmart.
[96:46.35]Or go to a... Any real... You could go to like a yard sale for this shit.
[96:50.85]So go buy like 30 phones.
[96:53.45]Landlines, right?
[96:56.40]Go install 30 fucking phones, put them on the ground, put them near the fridge, put one in the fridge.
[97:03.30]Make sure that there's like two or three phones in every single room.
[97:05.89]You can have the same phone number.
[97:09.21]Install these phones, and then if grandma falls down, oh, it's okay, because right next to the coffee table is a telephone.
[97:15.77]She'll just pick it up.
[97:16.33]She doesn't need to wear a thing on her wrist that is like a life alert.
[97:25.87]We monitor 24-7 and it's thousands of dollars.
[97:28.55]Get her a cell phone.
[97:52.38]Or you could just tape a cell phone to them.
[97:56.95]Whichever one you decide to do.
[98:01.55]But then, remember, a cell phone has to charge.
[98:03.31]So, let's say you duct tape a cell phone to your grandmother, right?
[98:16.36]She is eventually... Was she going to remember to charge that thing?
[98:26.29]That hurts.
[98:31.27]I can't fuck this up right now.
[98:32.57]Get rid of everything, please.
[98:36.33]Just tape a car battery.
[98:39.82]Yeah, just make all of your grandmother's furniture out of car batteries.
[98:45.52]Her bed is just going to be a series of 15 car batteries with one of those foam toppers on top of it.
[98:55.21]A chair, same deal.
[98:57.51]Yeah, just make sure the solar panel's all over the house.
[99:13.48]That sounds very safe.
[99:19.92]Line the floor.
[99:20.72]Yeah, instead of tile in the bathroom, it's just wireless chargers.
[99:33.02]Instead of shoes, your grandmother's gonna have dogs.
[99:49.14]Then you'll never have to worry about it.
[99:54.54]Now that I cheated, let's get some cheats here.
[99:58.51]I do want a saucer upgrade.
[100:01.61]Got both these.
[100:03.85]Alright.
[100:05.17]Sonic Boom.
[100:05.75]Increase the ammo and area of effect.
[100:07.37]It's my favorite thing.
[100:08.27]Let me just make sure I'm not going to spend all these.
[100:13.76]Alright, that's good.
[100:16.96]Mr. Crypto goes to Capital City.
[100:21.88]Can I tell you how DNA works?
[100:25.76]Yeah.
[100:31.36]I'm not going to, but I could if I wanted to.
[100:38.10]And food?
[100:38.66]What about, like, food for your grandma?
[100:40.40]How curious!
[100:41.78]I was tracking Armquist in hopes of discovering his secret base, but instead he came here, to a civilian facility known as the White House, to meet with his leader, the President.
[100:58.67]I knew it.
[100:59.83]Armquist couldn't lead an army of ants.
[101:02.39]Just go buy, like, 5,000 Campbell's tomato soups.
[101:08.46]Unhook them all.
[101:11.46]Dump them in a giant vat.
[101:13.12]I'm talking, like, half a cryogenic vat, like in funny, scary horror movies.
[101:20.41]I have a spigot on it.
[101:23.81]Like a giant... You know when the guy... When the coach... After a football game or after, you know, whatever.
[101:30.42]American football.
[101:31.22]Sorry.
[101:31.46]This is an EU stream.
[101:32.38]I got to talk to you guys like the way that you understand.
[101:35.00]After the American football game, and they dump the Gatorade on the guy, and he goes, Whoa!
[101:38.74]Alright, imagine one of those, like, as big as the house, full of condensed tomato soup with a spigot on it.
[101:46.72]So she can just pull on the lever and just have tomato soup come out into a cup, and they can live off that forever.
[101:52.19]Go, go, go, go, go.
[102:04.32]You don't understand American.
[102:05.76]No, it's alright.
[102:08.00]It's alright.
[102:14.78]No one drinks Gatorade?
[102:18.07]Well, I mean, you don't... Gatorade is weird, because... You're not supposed to drink it.
[102:25.29]Unless you are vigorously exercising.
[102:29.65]But they make it taste so goddamn good that it's hard not to.
[102:33.30]Now, where did I put my kids?
[102:34.70]I don't know why Gatorade has not made just a Gatorade quencher.
[102:39.66]You want to make more money, Gatorade?
[102:41.82]Market just a general juice drink.
[102:44.38]Oh, my God.
[102:45.46]Is my fly down?
[102:46.70]Don't look.
[102:47.31]Don't look.
[102:48.71]Oh, shit.
[102:50.85]Okay, I'm at the White House.
[102:53.05]Looks kind of like a palace.
[102:55.15]Big, stodgy, neoclassical plantation style.
[102:59.37]Alright, so what are we gonna do?
[103:00.07]Just get over there?
[103:00.61]Perhaps.
[103:05.51]Blue Rider, that Armquist.
[103:06.37]Picks some really stupid passwords.
[103:08.33]The password is Blue Rider.
[103:10.08]Okay.
[103:37.46]Blue rider?
[103:38.52]That armquist picks some really stupid passwords.
[103:42.78]I wanted to hear the voice.
[103:43.86]Excellent work, Crypto.
[103:45.78]I have detected military installations up ahead.
[103:48.63]Now that you have his password, persuade the guards to admit you inside.
[103:52.69]Blue rider.
[103:53.67]Infiltrate the armquist.
[103:56.75]That armquist picks some really stupid passwords.
[104:01.52]I'm sorry.
[104:03.20]I'm simply dying.
[104:06.39]See that?
[104:06.75]How's that for next level plays?
[104:07.89]You know what I'm saying?
[104:10.91]Okay.
[104:11.89]Blue rider.
[104:12.43]It's the back door?
[104:13.11]Oh, this is not the White House, is it?
[104:16.14]Oh, well.
[104:39.28]No, no, that can't be right.
[104:41.20]Carry the alpha, drop the theta, square root of the omega.
[104:44.76]Ah, damn!
[104:46.00]I never should have dropped those pot- March here, march there, march it yourself, jerk-off.
[104:52.05]Uh, where- fuck.
[104:53.47]Did I get by him?
[104:54.21]My DI sure is a mean son of a gun.
[105:01.31]Time to meet the president.
[105:02.03]Maybe I should just leave.
[105:03.41]Well, this is the president in, like, the 50s.
[105:04.95]What the fuck?
[105:06.41]I could be a star, I know it.
[105:08.81]That seems to happen a lot, huh?
[105:11.92]Alright, we got two generators here.
[105:13.12]I'm probably gonna have to get rid of them.
[105:15.14]In some fashion.
[105:17.14]Men in black.
[105:32.49]I'm fucking wrong with that guy right now.
[105:33.93]Is there another man in black behind me?
[105:35.31]I mustn't be late.
[105:36.71]They're waiting for me in the test chamber.
[105:38.67]Just these guys.
[105:39.99]That was a Half-Life joke, wasn't it?
[105:49.26]That was great.
[105:50.72]I'll take the points for that one.
[105:52.82]I know what you're thinking, ladies.
[105:54.74]And yes, I'm available.
[105:58.95]Safe to go.
[105:59.39]Blue rider.
[106:01.23]I don't get it.
[106:04.79]Why won't those commies invade already?
[106:07.01]Use Blue Moon.
[106:08.59]Blue Rider.
[106:10.00]Previous password.
[106:11.26]Use Blue Moon.
[106:12.08]Use Blue Rider.
[106:13.36]The password is Blue Rider.
[106:16.58]Welcome to the Octagon, sir.
[106:18.06]The General's expecting you.
[106:19.36]Thank you.
[106:23.74]I love my country.
[106:24.96]I love my flag.
[106:26.58]Try to get near Armquist and see what you can learn.
[106:30.70]Find Armquist.
[106:31.44]No police awareness.
[106:32.98]He's down there.
[106:38.00]I have to be very careful here.
[106:39.12]I don't want to blow this, for real.
[106:41.40]Because these guys are everywhere.
[106:42.38]Oh, man.
[106:47.70]I'm going to have to pee too bad.
[106:56.63]Agent Orbigaster Majestic is my name, and Furon Hunting is my game.
[107:01.39]And the odd political assassination, but I don't like to talk about that.
[107:06.12]I mustn't be late.
[107:07.70]They're waiting for me in the test chamber.
[107:10.30]Oh, wait.
[107:10.80]Wrong game.
[107:14.42]Who the fuck is this guy?
[107:20.79]Is that dead?
[107:21.49]Or sleeping?
[107:27.57]Which is why the president has asked me to make some changes.
[107:32.95]Changes?
[107:34.39]He's gonna be an alien right?
[107:35.95]They really did have a Kylo Ren voice here.
[107:49.33]Twelve years.
[107:50.83]Eleven years before that movie came out.
[107:53.79]This new threat, however, demands a radical new concept of national defense.
[107:59.80]The hell are you talking about?
[108:01.40]I'm talking about a project for a new American century.
[108:05.76]The time has come to unite our five defense branches under a single chain of command.
[108:12.46]Five branches?
[108:13.80]Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Majestic, of course.
[108:21.01]You've got to be kidding me.
[108:22.49]You know what I'm saying.
[108:23.09]It's the start of a whole new era, General.
[108:26.31]And the President would like you to deliver the good news.
[108:30.17]Are you out of your mind?
[108:30.85]Sounds nothing like Kylo Ren.
[108:32.19]What?
[108:32.41]Do you really think the Joint Chiefs and Majestic swallow them whole without a fight?
[108:36.10]I think you'd better convince them to.
[108:38.56]And General, don't ever talk to me that way again.
[108:42.82]Yes, sir.
[108:52.31]So, huh?
[108:53.91]Majestic and the army getting it on.
[108:57.15]Hmm, I should have known.
[108:59.09]Those sly dogs.
[109:01.21]Coast Guard isn't a branch.
[109:02.31]Okay.
[109:25.93]Stop the humans must not be as utterly moronic as we thought.
[109:29.75]Stop stealing the saucer.
[109:30.67]Your scout ship has been discovered.
[109:32.45]God.
[109:33.29]Yeah, right.
[109:34.35]Pull the other one.
[109:35.45]It's true.
[109:37.46]Los hombres de negro.
[109:38.88]I'm moving.
[109:39.36]Did we take the saucer as we speak?
[109:42.64]Yo.
[109:51.04]No time for this.
[109:52.00]I wonder if it's faster just to walk.
[110:00.91]Seriously.
[110:09.81]Um.
[110:12.73]Oh, dear.
[110:13.89]Oh, no.
[110:15.29]Oh, no.
[110:15.97]The fucking bridge.
[110:18.07]The goddamn bridge.
[110:19.83]Oh, no.
[110:24.83]I can only get there from this one bridge.
[110:31.23]Well, hopefully I still can make it.
[110:32.57]Still behind the U.
[110:59.49]It's one brick.
[111:00.91]I just spent a full minute.
[111:09.69]This is going to be a miracle if I can get there.
[111:30.64]I don't think that's going to go far at all.
[111:41.45]Move it.
[111:42.17]Move it.
[111:43.47]Oh, that's a missile launcher.
[111:44.81]No time for this shit.
[112:01.75]I'm not gonna make it I'm not gonna make it This will be an actual miracle if I can get there
[112:31.68]I'm gonna see it.
[112:34.87]It's gonna be in my view.
[112:36.23]And I'm not gonna be able to get there.
[112:40.49]Because I didn't go the one way I had to go.
[112:43.21]The only way I could go.
[113:11.45]For the love of fucking God.
[113:12.73]How was I supposed to know that that was the only possible way to do that?
[113:24.50]This one road, you can't go anywhere else.
[113:28.86]How curious!
[113:29.44]I was tracking Armquist in hopes of discovering his secret base, but instead he came here, to a civilian facility known as the White House, to meet with his leader, the President.
[113:52.22]It wouldn't be that big of a deal if I didn't have to do the entire thing again.
[113:59.57]The whole fucking thing.
[114:02.67]Find out what sort of place it is, what defenses it has.
[114:06.85]And then destroy all the humans, gotcha.
[114:10.38]No, no!
[114:11.54]Stealth is our watchword.
[114:13.96]Just disguise yourself and make your way to the White House.
[114:21.25]Something just exploded and I had nothing to do with it.
[114:24.15]Welcome to an old game.
[114:38.89]That's what I wanted to grab.
[114:39.92]That's the thing I wanted to grab.
[114:41.34]What?
[114:41.48]This is the guy.
[114:42.04]I'd like to grab this guy.
[114:58.43]AHHHAHAHA!
[115:24.47]Thanks for the password.
[115:26.87]Just walk around them.
[115:53.25]Come on, make me laugh.
[115:54.05]This is the spot.
[115:54.89]Here's the bridge.
[115:55.95]Just get across it.
[115:56.49]Christ sake.
[116:01.55]Don't get run over.
[116:29.37]Why won't Miss Kubla go out with me?
[116:31.95]She's a fox, and I dig her apartment.
[116:36.33]Here is my theorem.
[116:37.71]Quantum physics is crap.
[116:39.89]Boaz schmoz.
[116:41.25]I poop on his theory.
[116:43.85]No, no, that can't be right.
[116:45.77]Kaiser alpha, square root of the omega.
[116:49.33]Ah, damn.
[116:50.05]I never should have dropped those RDR squared.
[116:53.63]I don't get it.
[116:54.69]Let me in here.
[116:56.68]Get me the fuck out.
[117:00.19]Go right into the middle.
[117:06.87]Just have to walk around.
[117:16.32]And then straight out the front door.
[117:18.34]No people, right?
[117:24.07]There's one guy sleeping, right?
[117:25.59]He's still there?
[117:27.37]Good.
[117:30.65]I don't know.
[117:31.65]Just don't.
[117:32.03]Alright.
[117:33.39]Out.
[117:33.65]Alien invader presence confirmed.
[117:40.50]Out.
[117:40.88]Crypto, the humans must not be as utterly moronic as we thought.
[117:46.24]Your scout ship has been discovered.
[117:48.04]Here are the numbers up.
[117:49.10]Yeah, right.
[117:50.15]Pull the other one.
[117:51.59]It's true.
[117:52.97]I have to scan them with brain.
[117:58.05]Don't ask, don't tell.
[117:59.61]Works for me.
[118:01.09]Alright, out the front door.
[118:02.89]Hurry.
[118:05.77]I can't jump over this.
[118:10.54]Where am I going?
[118:11.16]Oh my god, I'm getting so turned around!
[118:13.40]Get over the fence!
[118:24.21]Oh, if I just blew into the water right there, I would've screamed as loud as I could.
[118:27.73]I'm gonna die.
[118:28.79]Come on, you glory hounds!
[118:31.29]You wanna live forever?
[118:32.53]Let's stop that little commie!
[118:34.29]Find him!
[118:34.79]Neutralize him!
[118:40.41]What was that?
[118:43.52]Oh, shit!
[118:44.04]This stupid guy with the MOBA moves!
[118:49.42]What are you doing?
[119:06.18]Get the fuck out of the way.
[119:17.86]Hurry up.
[119:21.74]When am I gonna play Dota 2?
[119:25.06]Tomorrow.
[119:26.00]How about that?
[119:26.76]We'll start with Dota 2 tomorrow.
[119:33.03]No, that's a joke.
[119:33.61]That's not happening, by the way.
[119:35.30]I'm not gonna play Dota.
[119:42.20]I still might not make this.
[119:51.51]This is still gonna be close.
[119:53.47]Goddamn tank.
[119:54.65]This tank wasn't here last time!
[120:00.65]That's not the thing I wanted to press!
[120:02.59]But it's okay.
[120:20.21]I can't shoot anything!
[120:22.05]Alright, timer's gone.
[120:22.81]Timer's gone.
[120:23.23]We're fine.
[120:38.60]I'm going to be quiet.
[120:49.61]Get me out of here.
[120:51.09]Stream Fortnite?
[120:53.82]No, let's just stream Fortnite.
[120:57.88]I'm never going to play Fortnite.
[121:11.82]Actually, no, that's not true.
[121:12.80]I played the original Fortnite.
[121:16.10]Next mission.
[121:26.61]I played the one where you had to open pinatas and grab the loot and shoot those zombies.
[121:35.93]I played it on PS4 for maybe two hours.
[121:38.45]And I was like, oh, I don't think I want to do this.
[121:44.63]Alright, let's go to the lab.
[121:51.55]Mm-hmm.
[121:52.57]I have both of these.
[121:53.43]Alright, ion detonator.
[121:55.62]Increased ammo.
[121:56.90]Increased area of effect.
[121:58.28]I don't think I really want that.
[122:00.38]Psychokinetic.
[122:01.74]Pick up tanks and robots.
[122:05.79]Mm-mm.
[122:12.58]Now, if I... If I... Am I going to lose this if I buy those?
[122:16.32]I'm not sure.
[122:19.93]Sorry, we can just fucking cheat again.
[122:21.13]We can just cheat again, so who cares?
[122:23.15]Here it is.
[122:24.83]Pick up tanks.
[122:25.49]And robots.
[122:25.89]Okay.
[122:42.90]Armquist versus the Furons.
[122:45.34]Give it a go.
[122:57.72]You said only once?
[122:58.78]Yeah, I'm not gonna do it again.
[123:02.97]Crypto, the warlord Armquist is heading to a meeting with the other human warmongers.
[123:08.71]His orders are to unite them against us.
[123:13.17]And what's the plan?
[123:14.71]Blow up car.
[123:16.95]Got it.
[123:18.51]Blow up car immediately.
[123:20.03]Win missions.
[123:22.23]No biggie.
[123:23.19]I'll just take him out.
[123:24.98]Yes, but that would still leave the others alive.
[123:27.62]Martyrs only stiffen their resolve.
[123:30.88]Oh, well.
[123:32.00]I guess I'll have to do them too.
[123:34.74]Follow Armquist to that meeting.
[123:36.90]Oh, shit.
[123:37.62]Okay.
[123:40.36]Just run behind him.
[123:42.88]That's 953 days without a bath.
[123:48.07]There's a new record.
[123:49.41]Call Guinness.
[123:50.79]Hmm, Guinness.
[123:54.97]He just fell down.
[123:55.59]Forget him.
[123:57.29]What the hell's wrong with Fuchsia?
[124:02.02]It's killer time.
[124:07.14]He didn't say no.
[124:09.84]He can't scan the sky!
[124:11.64]I'm gonna lose it.
[124:12.72]Oh, these guys are just everywhere.
[124:16.16]Get out of here!
[124:17.54]Do you guys have to be in every corner of the universe?
[124:35.51]Loot crate?
[124:36.77]Is loot crate still in business, by the way?
[124:49.74]Like subscription boxes.
[124:50.72]Remember when everybody was making subscription box videos?
[124:53.84]Because it's by and large the easiest, most lazy shit content you could ever make.
[124:59.68]Get paid to open up a box on stream.
[125:06.43]For, like, tons of money.
[125:08.51]People still buy those?
[125:11.17]I refuse to believe that.
[125:12.11]They're just dying off.
[125:29.06]What, you don't want, like, Mega Man high-fiving, uh, Walt from Breaking Bad on a t-shirt?
[125:34.35]This must be where the warmongers are gathering for their tribal war council.
[125:38.43]Take the form of a human warmonger and infiltrate Armquist's meeting.
[125:42.83]Then, use your powers...
[125:44.80]What?!
[125:45.04]No, I've tried to take his... What is that?
[125:47.04]Why did that happen?
[125:48.68]Why did that happen?
[125:50.52]I don't know why that happened.
[125:52.82]I'm not gonna pretend I know exactly why that happened.
[125:58.22]I'm not wearing any underwear.
[126:02.38]God.
[126:02.90]Like, what?
[126:04.48]Get off of this.
[126:05.93]I'm so dead.
[126:08.31]Like, this whole thing came crashing down.
[126:10.65]Because... I can't even explain to you what happened.
[126:13.67]But I assure you it was probably my fault.
[126:18.67]Like, it... Some of the... I'm not even going to complain.
[126:22.42]Whatever.
[126:28.27]Because all these people have to die.
[126:37.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[126:39.41]Oh, I'm about to scream.
[126:44.07]Go to sleep here for a second.
[126:48.37]Okay.
[127:03.02]if you press circle more than once
[127:31.35]It, like, it cues up you removing the disguise and putting it back on.
[127:35.60]So it's not just like, oh, press circle and put it on.
[127:37.30]Like, if you hit circle and then, like, circle again right after that, you're gonna change disguise, and then without... It just cues up taking the disguise off.
[127:49.26]The humans deserved it.
[127:50.18]Oh god, I gotta get this right.
[127:54.04]Who cares about the female?
[127:55.30]Blame rowdy kit.
[128:00.76]Rowdy kids?
[128:02.82]Rowdy kids.
[128:03.44]I hope this is right.
[128:04.42]Alright, good.
[128:05.08]Very professional.
[128:05.92]He's like, yeah!
[128:33.75]Last, a communist agent used an experimental nuclear explosive device in a direct attempt to assassinate me at Area 42.
[128:44.98]Like right now.
[128:48.50]Onquist is paranoid.
[128:49.56]Did you catch the assassin?
[128:51.79]Suck on this, warmongers.
[128:53.85]Give up now, humans.
[128:54.95]Onquist is paranoid.
[128:55.95]Did you catch the assassin?
[129:03.16]I'm gonna say did you catch the assassin I think because I don't the last two are confrontational I Don't suppose you managed to catch this so-called assassin general Or are we just supposed to take all this on faith?
[129:22.10]Sorry general, but you'll have to do better than that if you want my support he leaves
[129:30.23]What I learned last time you never tell anybody the truth or exactly what's about to happen to them I don't know who the hell you are general, but you got a big mouth Press circle you how did you do that?
[129:58.47]Nice dodge
[129:59.73]You shoot like a girl, Vladimir.
[130:03.47]Come and get me, you commie piece of crap.
[130:05.75]Okay.
[130:06.47]Okay, we'll do it your way.
[130:11.41]Boss fight?
[130:15.43]That was an impressive backwards run.
[130:17.08]Eat hot plasma, monkeys.
[130:22.44]You dirty rats.
[130:24.50]You're the rats who killed my boss.
[130:27.02]Boss man.
[130:29.64]Oh, this is gonna be fun.
[130:31.78]He's a giant inflated Master Chief.
[130:33.96]He's gonna have weak points.
[130:35.52]He's gonna have weak points.
[130:37.24]Watch out for those.
[130:38.11]I don't even know where they're going.
[131:06.99]Ooh, that tagged me.
[131:09.81]Whoa!
[131:11.46]Oh, boy.
[131:12.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:13.36]Yep, yep, yeah.
[131:15.08]Yep.
[131:16.26]Yeah.
[131:18.06]Heal here.
[131:34.22]Oh, I'm trapped in here.
[131:37.04]This is not a good place to be right now.
[131:40.80]Not a good place to be!
[131:41.86]Excuse me.
[132:02.92]Does that motherfucker have full health right now?
[132:05.10]No.
[132:05.78]Shaking the whole damn screen.
[132:10.00]Good ammo.
[132:10.66]Need forward motion here.
[132:35.45]Oh fucking Jesus Christ, a tank.
[132:38.93]Oh my lord, this is not good.
[132:45.76]This is not good.
[132:50.96]Not good.
[132:53.37]Not good!
[133:10.69]Whoa!
[133:25.26]Holy shit, man!
[133:29.84]I'm so dead!
[133:32.93]Ugh!
[133:55.87]No ammo!
[133:56.27]Woo!
[133:56.63]Let's stop that little commie!
[133:58.79]Find him!
[133:59.29]Neutralize him!
[134:07.61]Got it!
[134:07.99]Got it!
[134:08.35]Got it!
[134:08.71]Got it!
[134:09.05]Got it!
[134:09.41]Got it!
[134:09.77]Dead!
[134:10.07]That was... Thank God for those respawning health packs.
[134:16.62]Go on, you comet punk.
[134:19.40]Finish him.
[134:20.26]It didn't have to be this way, Armquist.
[134:23.82]What do you mean?
[134:26.26]I mean this ridiculous war.
[134:29.43]We could have worked together, you and I, to forge a new future, a common future of peace and prosperity for our two peoples.
[134:39.13]Just put me out of my misery, will you?
[134:42.02]I'm serious.
[134:43.46]You...
[134:44.93]You didn't want to destroy us?
[134:47.29]Of course not.
[134:49.21]We were as scared of you as you were of us.
[134:52.57]This is bullshit.
[134:53.55]Deep in our hearts, I think what we really wanted was to be just like you.
[135:01.04]Really?
[135:01.88]Really.
[135:03.52]I guess, at the end of the day, we really are all just human beings.
[135:15.11]I'm not going to show that.
[135:19.47]He should have been mid-sentence and he should have exploded.
[135:28.05]If he just turned into a skeleton right there... Monarch was exposed, Red General killed and failed coup d'etat.
[135:37.14]Attempt.
[135:40.06]Wait, oh!
[135:45.27]spawn here alright mothership coop data what come on I was just reading it the lone gunman capital city
[136:13.47]I know it's coup d'etat, I know, but I'm reading it just... My brain just read the words and didn't... do anything else.
[136:23.14]I've been monitoring the radio.
[136:25.18]This human wither says the president will appear before his subjects today.
[136:29.73]This president must be more integral to their social order than I suspected.
[136:34.79]I have noticed a significant increase in activity in front of the White House.
[136:39.71]Okay.
[136:41.12]Arrows purple.
[136:42.08]The arrow's purple, Furon.
[137:18.11]How dare you mispronounce a language you don't speak.
[137:21.55]Yeah, but like everybody knows what coup d'etat is.
[137:27.89]It's like, I should know how to say that.
[137:31.81]I should.
[137:37.37]Okay.
[137:38.35]Follow the barricade.
[137:39.63]Not the barricade, the carcade.
[137:43.70]The motorcade.
[137:44.34]Yeah.
[137:46.60]Oh, look.
[137:47.64]Their vehicles use hydrocarbon combustion.
[137:50.44]Oh, great.
[137:52.12]Crypto, try not to breathe.
[137:54.14]You must get closer to the president's car.
[137:56.94]I'm using the scanner signal.
[138:00.96]Hurry, Crypto.
[138:01.98]Get closer.
[138:03.04]I'm trying.
[138:03.80]The scanner's out of range.
[138:05.19]How am I going to get closer?
[138:07.39]I've got shit to deal with.
[138:08.65]I've got men in black that are seeing through my disguise.
[138:10.65]You've got to remember this.
[138:14.89]Alright, I'm right there.
[138:17.37]You can't scan this.
[138:17.95]Scan it already.
[138:18.61]Scan it.
[138:20.09]I'm being such a freak right now.
[138:21.73]Oh my god.
[138:22.13]Oh my god.
[139:06.18]Why are you guys saying Soylent?
[139:07.98]I don't like Soylent.
[139:09.46]Soylent.
[139:10.04]Hey, you guys wanna know something about Soylent?
[139:26.05]Right on.
[139:27.03]I'll tell you a little insider information about that fucking stuff.
[139:33.28]The mothership's tracking system is broken.
[139:35.64]I think he uses those convoys of long black vehicles for transit.
[139:39.74]Remember we were talking about old ladies?
[139:42.44]And grandmas and old people?
[139:43.79]I can't exactly pinpoint the president from orbit, Crypto.
[139:47.69]It's not like he walks around with a big red arrow over his head.
[139:51.31]I need to follow those vehicles so we can identify him.
[139:54.68]And put it in a different package.
[139:57.60]I'm convinced that they just pour out and shore into the Soylent bottles.
[140:03.48]And then sell it at a premium.
[140:12.61]I can't be spotted here.
[140:19.57]I swear to God, man.
[140:21.91]I hate those stupid Men in Black guys.
[140:23.48]They're just everywhere.
[140:27.98]Am I gonna make it?
[140:28.44]Am I gonna make it?
[140:29.34]Those things are so expensive.
[140:31.44]You know, you could just eat a banana.
[140:51.26]A banana is like 80 cents.
[140:54.19]Oh, look.
[140:55.25]Their vehicles use hydrocarbon combustion.
[140:58.43]How quaint.
[140:59.73]Crypto, try not to breathe.
[141:01.76]You must get closer to the president's car.
[141:04.56]I'm losing the scanner signal.
[141:06.59]The guy on the radio said this speech was of vital importance.
[141:10.39]And I always believe everything I hear on the radio.
[141:13.49]Especially those nutjobs on the morning zoo.
[141:15.80]Man, oh man, do they crack me up.
[141:18.90]Hurry, Crypto.
[141:20.08]Get closer.
[141:21.38]The scanner's out of range.
[141:25.18]There's nothing you...
[141:27.05]Hmm.
[141:27.83]Passengers and components are both made of carbon compounds.
[141:31.51]Okay, watch out for the side here.
[141:32.59]They must have gotten the soylent green leather interior.
[141:35.45]Pricey option.
[141:40.78]Don't get spotted, please.
[141:43.40]She's a fox, and I dig her apartment.
[141:47.02]Oh, their electronics are masking all human neuroelectrical signals.
[141:51.50]Well, so much for bio news.
[141:53.91]We still got the horoscope, though.
[141:58.44]It's Soylent.
[141:59.74]I used to drink Soylent.
[142:00.78]I wanted to try it.
[142:04.36]I bought, like, a pack.
[142:05.83]And I was like, whoa, Soylent, huh?
[142:08.23]It's like a meal... Yeah, people used to drink this shit on diets instead of eating.
[142:12.81]What the fuck?
[142:13.51]What?
[142:13.67]Attack?
[142:14.13]That almost instantly killed me.
[142:32.08]Good thing I can kite them around because I need this help.
[142:34.34]I can pick up robots now, can't I?
[142:39.68]Oh, jeez.
[143:07.68]Double ambush.
[143:09.76]Gotta hand it to those monkeys.
[143:11.71]Yeah, I tried it one time.
[143:14.95]Crypto, the wither creature has just made another broadcast.
[143:20.01]He says the president will be appearing before his subjects in a short time.
[143:25.52]Why does everything have to be on a timer?
[143:27.60]Everything!
[143:50.18]How the fuck was I supposed to get over here without taking any damage or anything?
[143:59.05]And I'm fucking seen!
[144:21.91]Yada, yada, yada.
[144:22.93]Just get to the economic stimulus package already.
[144:26.44]God, I love games.
[144:28.58]Did I win?
[144:29.24]Very smooth.
[144:30.06]Of course, I wouldn't expect the humans to die now.
[144:32.84]Alright, end the mission.
[144:34.08]I killed them.
[144:34.76]I did it.
[144:35.46]But hey, you're a big bro now, right?
[144:37.84]You can take care of yourself.
[144:39.00]Okay, I would.
[144:39.46]Please do.
[144:40.14]Crypto, the dudes in dark have found your saucer.
[144:44.47]No.
[144:44.95]I think they're planning to destroy it this time.
[144:47.23]No.
[144:48.07]No.
[144:48.31]I have a minute.
[144:49.71]But it looks to me like they're laying enough to breach the power cells.
[144:54.10]That could vaporize the entire city.
[144:56.42]Don't.
[144:59.54]Somebody's mad.
[145:00.18]No, I'm not mad.
[145:00.80]I'm just stressed out.
[145:06.42]Get over the fucking railing!
[145:08.00]Oh my god, this is too stressful.
[145:09.64]Good thing that guy tripped.
[145:15.72]That shit ain't enough time.
[145:18.60]How did 11 year olds do this?
[145:20.19]When I was 11 years old, how did I do this?
[145:28.13]Reliably.
[145:29.87]That's a tank.
[145:30.53]We're going this way.
[145:44.37]I better not miss this whole thing here.
[145:46.25]Come on, it's right here.
[145:47.11]Alright, there it is.
[145:50.23]Alright, good.
[145:50.61]Eleven-year-old me didn't get fed up this fast.
[146:12.32]I guess not, but... I don't know, it's true.
[146:25.95]Wait, so I didn't kill him?
[146:27.33]Oh, no, he is dead, okay.
[146:32.22]11 year old you had patience?
[146:35.88]It's not that I don't have patience now.
[146:40.24]You know, I think part of the reason why is we've been... Video games have gotten a lot easier.
[146:49.55]They just have.
[146:51.03]With checkpoints and being able to restart in certain scenarios and not having complete failures, total failures of the entire mission.
[147:00.74]Soft failures are in a lot of games now.
[147:04.14]They used to be brutal like this.
[147:07.23]And I think over time, the last maybe 10, 15 years, maybe starting somewhere in like the, I'd say like the late, somewhere like 2008 plus, games started progressively getting easier to accomplish.
[147:21.06]And now going back and playing these old games that weren't really even that hard back in the day, but they just, this is what games were.
[147:29.39]It's like, holy shit.
[147:31.29]It's like jumping into a pool, a ice cold pool without like going in slowly.
[147:40.71]You're just submerging yourself.
[147:42.71]Oh, I don't have enough friends.
[147:47.13]So, I killed... The president's gone.
[147:49.31]The leader of the military's gone.
[147:52.21]I have to assume I'm near the end of the game here.
[147:57.78]Destroy all humans isn't brutal, you just suck.
[148:00.62]No, but you're missing the point I'm trying to make, is that... Being so used to playing newer games that are much easier and much more forgiving, and going back here...
[148:10.36]is a lot different because it's a completely different mindset.
[148:12.62]You can't just kind of fuck around.
[148:13.88]You have to get it done.
[148:23.07]You can't just, like, throw a grenade on the ground and, like, laugh while you get to start five seconds before where you threw the grenade.
[148:28.25]Now that the president is dead, the human senators are voting for a new leader.
[148:33.19]The vote is agonizingly close.
[148:35.52]Doesn't the vice president become president?
[148:39.38]Just shut up and kill those senators before they get inside the Capitol!
[148:43.20]What was that?
[148:46.49]Alright.
[148:48.11]Give it to all the senators.
[148:49.87]Run for your lives!
[148:52.06]They're all trying to get away from the Capitol building.
[148:55.64]That guy is... That guy's... This is much... Alright.
[148:59.93]So, um... Apparently that ability got a little stronger.
[149:04.05]I just want to get rid of the Senators.
[149:05.55]You guys aren't Senators.
[149:07.89]Okay.
[149:19.06]Damn, that drill serge bootin' me out of easy company.
[149:21.54]20 senators.
[149:22.08]Now I pull this lame duck assignment.
[149:24.56]Let none past you!
[149:26.51]Eliminate them!
[149:27.53]Alright.
[149:31.75]Bird?
[149:32.41]Coltrane?
[149:33.35]Bird?
[149:33.91]Coltrane?
[149:34.57]I just don't know, daddy-o.
[149:36.35]Oh, these are them.
[149:37.45]Okay, well... Are these the senators?
[149:43.79]Where are these things?
[149:44.49]Did I miss something here?
[149:45.69]Do I have to go in the building?
[149:48.67]I'm confused.
[150:16.76]These guys look like senators.
[150:18.90]I don't think these are senators.
[150:28.10]A lot of ammo.
[150:39.91]Maybe I should try to reset it here?
[150:43.79]Get in the ship maybe?
[150:45.33]Destroy the capital building?
[150:51.67]It's almost as if the purple beam is telling you to hold your ground.
[150:54.23]Well, but where are the senators?
[150:58.07]I didn't see anyone.
[150:59.65]Okay.
[151:00.25]Um...
[151:20.64]I see more senators as well as some soldiers.
[151:26.14]I think something might be wrong here.
[151:42.98]I got one.
[151:43.70]I got one.
[151:44.59]One died.
[151:48.35]I killed one.
[151:49.01]I got a senator.
[151:53.10]I don't know which one of these guys was the senator.
[151:55.05]It was somebody.
[151:56.87]20 people can't get in.
[151:58.85]Well, they're not trying to get out, they're trying to get in.
[152:05.51]I guess.
[152:09.20]That makes more sense.
[152:48.78]It told you that?
[152:49.38]Yeah, but those guys don't look like senators.
[152:50.82]They look like... Everybody started saying they look like reporters.
[152:54.02]They've sent in their cyborgs!
[152:59.10]Can Steve Austin be far behind?
[153:01.15]Are you the Stone Cold Steve Austin girlfriend?
[153:22.71]I have a grenade launcher and I refuse to use it.
[153:36.18]I mean, I'm not going to use it here.
[153:37.52]The grenade launcher kind of sucks.
[153:40.72]Look at the range of the grenade launcher.
[153:43.06]You throw it 15 feet in front of you.
[153:44.82]I feel like I'll kill myself with that if I use that too often.
[153:52.44]One guy voted.
[154:00.26]Well, that guy's the new Super Senator.
[154:13.29]The bot's gonna be taken care of pretty easily now with the PK that I have.
[154:16.72]Just pick him up and throw him into the ground.
[154:24.68]Okay, here we go.
[154:26.02]Do it up.
[154:30.09]Senator Mega Man, that's right.
[154:41.53]This is where we enslave the human race.
[154:43.21]The humans have mass-produced a weapon that threatens our main invasion force!
[154:47.76]These Tesla Coils are cheap shoddy versions of the ones you met in Area 42.
[154:53.22]And you, my impulsive friend, are to destroy every Tesla Coil unit in town.
[154:58.78]Okay.
[155:03.56]Sounds fun!
[155:05.90]What do you say?
[155:06.58]Let's start on the right.
[155:07.40]Right to left.
[155:08.08]No timers, so that's good.
[155:10.40]Interesting.
[155:12.22]Some are automated, but others require human operators.
[155:16.68]So what do I do with those?
[155:18.94]Simple.
[155:20.02]Each unit must be connected to a nearby control console.
[155:23.80]Destroy them all.
[155:25.02]I don't care how.
[155:27.12]Once again, Krypto, you have crystallized the thrust of my gist entirely.
[155:31.22]I guess you can do it.
[155:38.60]We're just going to go straight up attack mode.
[155:41.52]That's all we're going to do.
[155:43.38]Yes.
[155:43.50]Just go.
[155:43.76]I don't need to... Just destroy them.
[155:45.34]Do you want to use the saucer?
[155:48.86]Um...
[156:02.45]Looked like I couldn't get in it.
[156:04.55]I'm standing underneath it.
[156:05.71]I didn't get, like... Enter a saucer is an option.
[156:10.33]Saucy Jupiter.
[156:10.83]So much for left... So much for right to left, huh?
[156:36.54]Oh, you loser.
[156:39.00]You loser.
[156:41.52]Don't crash into these.
[157:07.13]So this is 50% health bullshit.
[157:07.87]My max health is... Kill the scientists too.
[157:10.01]I can do that.
[157:10.43]Or I can at least try.
[157:43.17]That's it right there.
[157:45.96]No scientists, it's right here.
[157:51.40]Hmm.
[158:07.34]Oh, you die?
[158:16.00]I'm running out of ammo.
[158:17.92]I need to find some here.
[158:19.04]Zap-o-matic.
[158:19.58]8 out of 14.
[158:20.00]Shit.
[158:20.14]Oh, thanks, guys.
[158:37.79]This one's so far away, they're so spread out.
[158:56.89]Alright, anything else I can do?
[158:58.05]I don't think I can... Can I even blow that up with the... Shit, I'm in trouble here.
[159:01.82]Over here.
[159:02.38]I can't use him as like a blender and grind this up?
[159:23.46]Turn him this way, come on, turn him!
[159:26.47]Turn his body!
[159:56.60]very much so my brain I don't even know if this is hurting this
[160:21.65]Pick up another body.
[160:25.37]Turn him.
[160:27.45]Fuck, I need to get him.
[160:38.76]Come on.
[160:40.16]Grind it.
[160:48.54]Is this even working?
[160:51.50]I don't even think that's doing anything.
[160:53.38]Weren't there control panels for some of them?
[160:55.54]Not all of them though.
[160:56.26]Apparently that one doesn't have a control panel.
[160:58.76]We're gonna have to... Bad news.
[161:12.30]I'm gonna have to go back to it.
[161:13.18]I can't do anything about it.
[161:16.43]I have a rifle.
[161:18.49]Her name is Sue.
[161:23.64]God damn it, really?
[161:34.00]Well, I'm actually boned here.
[161:36.53]I'm gonna have to let go, climb the rooftops and get ammo.
[161:44.49]Can't even go that high.
[161:59.48]Come on!
[162:00.40]Don't do this to me!
[162:01.84]Oh, man!
[162:02.81]Can we use the UFO?
[162:10.71]I couldn't get in the UFO.
[162:17.20]I couldn't get inside of it.
[162:18.14]I was standing underneath it and there was no... I tried to.
[162:23.06]Doesn't work.
[162:30.07]if I can then that doesn't make any sense because I was actually standing underneath
[162:51.85]I want to see if, like, for some reason I can get in the UFO.
[162:54.67]That would be frustrating if I could, because I couldn't at the beginning of the level.
[163:07.96]So, the answer is no.
[163:09.43]I cannot get in here.
[163:30.76]Are you really going to jubate me right now?
[163:32.56]Is that what you wanted?
[163:34.38]That's it?
[163:36.40]That's what you wanted to see?
[163:37.74]Let's just go collect stuff.
[163:51.92]I could just actually sit here.
[163:54.16]Or just go in a circle and collect.
[164:01.58]five up there again do you have 50 which should be enough to get at least one of them over here maybe
[164:33.78]Why not use the saucer?
[164:34.92]Don't e- Please!
[164:39.26]No!
[164:40.14]Stop it!
[164:43.42]Stop it!
[164:45.78]Stop it!
[164:58.32]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[165:00.06]Alright, get rid of this thing!
[165:18.48]Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[165:21.42]Get in the saucer, what are you, stupid?
[165:24.23]Jerma, why are you so dumb?
[165:25.53]Get in the saucer!
[165:27.63]Come on, pick him up.
[165:29.61]Go around.
[165:39.82]Make it easy on yourself.
[165:40.90]Just use the saucer.
[165:42.82]You know what?
[165:43.14]I should just get in the saucer, right?
[165:45.60]I can't.
[165:46.70]There's nothing I can do.
[165:57.86]I'm almost out of ammunition here.
[166:01.72]Don't blow it here.
[166:02.60]Come on, please.
[166:04.34]I don't like this mission at all.
[166:06.74]Please don't make me have to do it like two more times.
[166:12.82]A couple of grenades.
[166:19.29]Dude, honest to God, is the entire population of your entire city secret agents?
[166:27.77]It's reporters and secret agents.
[166:29.49]It's the whole town.
[166:33.79]I'm losing focus that rock hudson what a dream boat did I just think that um lumberjacks football uh ah yeah that's better okay three more
[167:00.11]This whole place is a trap.
[167:01.97]Jeremy, don't blow it.
[167:17.92]Jeremy, don't blow it.
[167:18.98]Jeremy, don't blow it.
[167:20.36]Jeremy.
[167:28.08]There we go.
[167:28.46]No, I'm not gonna blow it.
[167:29.92]I'm ready.
[167:30.16]You had to pull up right in front of me?
[167:32.26]Did you have to do that?
[167:34.06]Okay.
[167:34.32]Scientist.
[167:53.96]Hypnotize him.
[167:54.62]What happened?
[167:56.62]Okay, calm down.
[167:57.20]Calm down.
[167:57.92]Get these.
[167:58.78]Alright, easy, easy.
[168:02.08]Just slow down.
[168:02.88]Go.
[168:24.05]That one guy saw me.
[168:25.25]This disguise is Jessica Rabbit in gold.
[168:29.13]Uh-oh.
[168:29.81]What did I do with my gun?
[168:32.25]It's not in my holster.
[168:33.95]It's not in my pants.
[168:35.05]Oh, it's in my hand.
[168:37.93]It's right there.
[168:38.83]Alright, come on.
[168:42.17]Oh, well done.
[168:43.87]A big, noisy scene.
[168:46.31]Just what we needed.
[168:48.30]Oh!
[168:52.97]Mom!
[168:53.73]Mom!
[168:59.07]I'm freaking out!
[169:01.15]No!
[169:04.79]I'm freaking... God damn it!
[169:13.88]I'm freaking out.
[169:14.94]Okay, I'm fine.
[169:15.96]I'm fine.
[169:20.03]Alright, just destroy it.
[169:26.59]It's almost done.
[169:27.55]It's right here.
[169:28.59]It's right in your grasp.
[169:31.85]Run!
[169:33.32]Complete.
[169:44.86]I freaked out right there when I was trying to hide behind the staircase.
[169:50.07]Thank God that guy shot that over there while I was on the ground.
[169:58.41]When you're ready.
[169:59.05]I feel like I need more... DNA.
[170:02.97]I feel like I do.
[170:09.19]Could have used the saucer.
[170:15.65]If I look over in this chat and I see, should have used the saucer again.
[170:21.11]I'm going to eat a handful of bugs.
[170:30.81]Attack of the 50-foot president.
[170:45.18]I didn't say bees.
[170:46.06]I didn't tell you what bugs they were.
[170:47.80]Here you stand at the seat of all human power.
[170:54.99]And they're turning over the keys to the whole planet.
[170:58.71]Our victory is complete.
[171:03.70]You guys are fucking out of control of it.
[171:09.04]No more blowing stuff up.
[171:11.34]Get to the capital building.
[171:12.14]Oh, the Furon Emperor will be most pleased.
[171:15.56]Yeah, it's hard to believe.
[171:19.42]Silhouette will be meeting you there himself.
[171:22.05]I can't get in.
[171:25.87]Sure, it's the least we can do.
[171:29.71]Well, domination awaits.
[171:31.45]We're going to eat gummy worms?
[171:42.03]There he is.
[171:44.38]Here comes the great, the big reveal.
[171:53.68]Silhouette, I presume.
[171:56.06]You don't look like a general.
[171:58.67]You don't look like a little green man.
[172:01.49]Thank you.
[172:03.83]So, waving the white flag, huh?
[172:07.31]All the monkeys got together, scratched their heads, accepted the inevitable.
[172:13.25]That sense of humor.
[172:15.30]Just like your... Like my what?
[172:18.18]Uh, file.
[172:20.38]Your dossier, Crypto.
[172:22.48]Said you were quite the joker.
[172:24.78]I think I never told you my name.
[172:28.50]No, I suppose I have your brother to thank for that.
[172:32.01]The double-cross?
[172:44.18]Who is it?
[172:46.72]I don't know who that is.
[172:48.36]You're a chick?
[172:50.74]I'm a patriot.
[172:52.88]If you had to put up with politicians playing grab-ass all day long, you'd wear a mask too.
[172:58.56]Me?
[172:59.22]I get my kicks the old-fashioned way.
[173:01.45]Is she huge or am I just really small?
[173:02.61]Beating up bad monkeys.
[173:04.71]Funny, that's just what Crypto136 said.
[173:07.57]Of course, he was a real cut-up too.
[173:11.65]Well, so much for plan A.
[173:15.22]What's that?
[173:17.86]That, my gender-deprived friend, is plan B. Here comes the giant monster.
[173:22.57]The end of your insidious invasion.
[173:24.35]Here's the last boss.
[173:25.09]A champion even you can't defeat.
[173:27.47]The greatest political mind of the 20th century.
[173:31.15]The greatest weapon ever built by man.
[173:32.91]Those are some long legs.
[173:34.87]Oh, no, no.
[173:35.23]He's standing on top of the building.
[173:37.56]Behold, the Robo-Prez.
[173:40.94]I thought he had giant ostrich legs.
[173:45.00]If elected, I promise to destroy all furons!
[173:52.08]That is seriously messed up.
[173:56.98]Robopress!
[173:58.42]Dirty tricks mode!
[173:59.86]Plan A is Plan B. Aw, man!
[174:02.83]Now I'm gonna get my suit dirty.
[174:05.71]Oh.
[174:08.35]Get to the saucer.
[174:10.21]I can use it now!
[174:10.87]Not dead.
[174:11.37]Circus midget found slain.
[174:13.07]Clown show ends in tragedy.
[174:35.74]Oh, it didn't even give me a chance.
[174:39.03]Just dodge the bullets.
[174:55.13]Here you stand at the seat of all human power.
[174:58.81]And they're turning over the keys to the whole planet.
[175:02.51]Our victory is complete.
[175:06.15]Give me, give me, give me.
[175:10.43]Walk up, straight in, and then just turn around.
[175:13.39]Oh, the Furon Emperor will be most pleased.
[175:19.37]Yeah, it's hard to believe.
[175:22.01]Okay, let's do it again.
[175:23.37]This time I'm going to try to dodge these bullets here.
[175:25.47]Come on, you glory hounds.
[175:26.73]You want to live forever?
[175:28.13]Let's stop that little commie.
[175:29.87]Find him, neutralize him.
[175:31.67]Ah!
[175:39.94]Can I get to my saucer?
[175:41.46]Alright, it's time.
[175:50.85]Time to fail this over and over again.
[175:58.60]Bingo.
[175:59.76]Destroy Robopret.
[176:07.63]Let's clear out all the adds first.
[176:09.19]That's exactly like a raid boss.
[176:11.37]Treat it like a raid boss.
[176:13.09]Nuke it.
[176:21.63]Nuke it again.
[176:24.03]Hold on.
[176:30.28]Here they come.
[176:30.74]Get rid of the adds.
[176:34.16]Oh, that was a taxi.
[176:35.80]It's over here.
[176:37.82]Sam's side.
[176:43.35]Where's his health?
[176:47.51]Still has quite a bit.
[176:48.63]I need some ammo.
[176:54.35]Tesla coil.
[176:55.08]Alright, here we go.
[176:55.98]That's what I'm talking about.
[177:02.96]Give it to me.
[177:07.59]Absolutely great.
[177:14.10]Where are you going?
[177:16.72]Where are you going?
[177:17.28]Where the fuck is he going?
[177:18.26]Alright, get rid of the ads.
[177:19.42]We're good?
[177:31.55]Looks like we're good.
[177:32.15]Okay.
[177:32.99]More Sonic ammo.
[177:34.24]Okay, watch out for that.
[177:35.20]I got these mines in the air.
[177:36.92]I'm gonna run into one of those.
[177:42.06]There we go.
[178:01.86]Is that 50%?
[178:11.47]Almost.
[178:15.47]40%?
[178:15.59]Any more ammo around here?
[178:21.00]Not that I can see.
[178:23.02]That hurts.
[178:36.78]What am I doing?
[178:38.32]Get it!
[178:39.66]Pick it up.
[179:03.30]Got it back.
[179:03.92]Okay.
[179:08.30]Easy now.
[179:08.94]Easy now.
[179:10.22]Take out the stuff that's around us.
[179:12.98]Fucking cocky.
[179:13.60]Don't be a dumbass.
[179:15.02]I know you will if you give me strength.
[179:19.36]Okay, that guy just iron manned over here.
[179:21.24]For a second, I thought that was intentional.
[179:22.70]I don't think it was.
[179:36.67]Is that tank alive?
[179:37.45]I don't think so.
[179:43.82]Where's this guy?
[179:44.42]Where are you?
[179:44.84]Where are you?
[179:45.38]Where are you?
[179:46.74]Where are you?
[179:47.44]Where are you?
[179:50.89]Oh, fuck you!
[180:06.51]I'm going to drop this down here.
[180:13.66]The last part.
[180:14.58]And he's taking his brain stem and heading home.
[180:22.12]Everybody's so mean to him.
[180:24.44]Follow him to the White House and crush him like a tin can in a trash can.
[180:34.60]Take out the little adds.
[180:35.60]Come on, man.
[180:39.51]You've been here before.
[180:40.23]You know how this works.
[180:43.47]Alright.
[180:46.55]I'm going to finish him off.
[180:54.85]Any ammo anywhere?
[180:56.19]I could use some.
[180:57.19]There we go.
[180:58.67]Right here.
[181:04.62]Bingo.
[181:10.84]What is that move?
[181:14.55]Shoot it?
[181:17.09]Shoot it.
[181:30.45]It's gonna be me or you, and it's gonna be you.
[181:37.81]Burn!
[181:38.69]Burn!
[181:39.59]He's so close!
[181:40.63]Give me all this shit!
[181:43.69]Sayonara.
[181:46.43]What do they say at the end of Independence Day?
[181:47.91]Uh... I don't know what they say at the end of Independence Day.
[181:53.26]Just pretend I said it.
[181:55.06]Man, I love the smell of presidential brains in the morning.
[182:00.00]Just remember who set that giant potus of destruction upon you.
[182:04.14]Potus.
[182:05.24]Right.
[182:06.68]You know who I mean.
[182:09.40]Oh, that silhouette guy, right?
[182:11.94]Or chick.
[182:13.28]Could you do me a favor and not creep me out?
[182:16.05]Sure.
[182:17.07]In any case, he, I mean she, ran from the capital.
[182:19.89]I lost sight of him.
[182:20.91]Her.
[182:21.61]Silhouette.
[182:22.31]Near the... Attention, Furans.
[182:25.21]Attention, Furans.
[182:27.43]Is this thing on?
[182:28.41]Oh, whatever.
[182:29.80]I know you little gray freaks can hear this.
[182:32.46]Where is she?
[182:33.06]I'm sure you're out there listening, floating.
[182:37.29]Pretty much, yeah.
[182:39.20]It seems only fair.
[182:41.09]Credit where credit is due.
[182:43.27]You did it.
[182:44.33]You beat my beautiful Robopress.
[182:47.21]And now you're probably sitting around fantasizing about destroying all the humans.
[182:53.21]Typical.
[182:54.51]Sure you handled the boys, Armquist Huffman.
[182:58.72]Oh, that was a challenge.
[183:01.75]But everybody knows which sex is dominant on this planet.
[183:05.31]There's still plenty of time to get your asses handed to you.
[183:08.88]That is, if you're not too scared to fight a girl.
[183:12.34]Fighting another Robopress.
[183:14.18]I'm not hung up on the whole pudenda thing.
[183:17.66]So come on, Krypto.
[183:19.56]Let's dance.
[183:21.24]I'll even let you lead.
[183:23.98]I'm at the Octagon.
[183:25.36]Don't keep me waiting.
[183:28.30]Okay.
[183:29.08]Land at the Octagon.
[183:33.02]That's not the octagon, but I'm gonna pick up these because I might need them.
[183:40.25]Collect it all.
[183:40.97]No, that's just dangerous.
[183:42.87]Just go.
[183:43.65]Everywhere!
[184:03.78]I'm gonna crash!
[184:06.36]This whole thing is coming down.
[184:21.69]Okay.
[184:23.75]What's the deal now?
[184:29.43]Are we getting a cut seed, end of the game, boss death?
[184:31.65]Or are we getting a fight?
[184:32.93]Oh no, it's a fight.
[184:35.36]Oh no.
[184:36.44]Look at all these people.
[184:37.26]I need to... I gotta pee so bad.
[184:56.56]Don't, don't do it!
[184:58.34]It did it!
[184:59.44]It did it, it did it, it did it, it did it, it did it, it did it, it did it!
[185:02.22]Where is she, there right there?
[185:05.28]Just kite her around.
[185:25.89]Take out the little dumb globe enemies.
[185:28.01]I just shot every bullet over them.
[185:32.22]Talk about a panic.
[185:32.94]Look at that.
[185:33.67]Unbelievable.
[186:02.20]That's it, right?
[186:02.84]Okay, just me and her.
[186:03.96]No, these guys all came out of nowhere.
[186:05.50]That's great.
[186:05.82]At least the stuff respawns.
[186:06.76]I want a grenade in front of her.
[186:08.64]Where is she?
[186:09.24]That didn't really do anything to her.
[186:11.08]I mean, I guess it kind of is.
[186:33.16]She would have dodged into that, but whatever.
[186:34.62]Keep going into it.
[186:36.92]In, in, in, in, in.
[186:37.84]Alright, I'm out of bullets with this.
[186:39.30]Can I anal probe her?
[186:39.99]I don't think so.
[186:59.41]I think I just gave her power.
[187:01.41]Collection.
[187:02.47]Just Discollect.
[187:27.71]Fuck that guy.
[187:28.53]Give me that!
[187:36.46]Alright, that was... That was intense.
[187:54.14]Where is she?
[187:59.89]Somebody just shot me with a soothing gun.
[188:13.78]I picked that up in real life.
[188:15.30]Okay.
[188:21.20]Pick up items.
[188:23.50]There she is.
[188:29.03]Why is she back up to full health?
[188:32.25]Was she just drinking something?
[188:33.65]Was she Estus Blasting or something?
[188:37.42]I feel like she was.
[188:41.06]Is she susceptible to this?
[188:47.82]Not really.
[188:58.99]Shut me off.
[189:01.01]Bastard.
[189:06.77]Oh, these fucking stupid things, man.
[189:09.89]Do they have to just be everywhere?
[189:13.16]I'm dead.
[189:17.38]I'm so dead.
[189:19.58]How lucky that I didn't die there.
[189:36.95]She's not going to do that thing.
[189:37.71]She's not going to disappear again, right?
[189:45.16]So close.
[189:47.88]No, there she goes again.
[189:48.72]She's doing it again.
[189:50.60]What is this bullshit?
[190:02.91]What am I doing here?
[190:07.13]Am I doing something?
[190:08.51]Do I have to interrupt her from doing that?
[190:18.38]I must have to, like, I have to interrupt her.
[190:22.18]How?
[190:23.26]Just do enough damage where it breaks her concentration or something?
[190:25.70]Probably just shock her.
[190:36.25]I'll try it.
[190:37.07]Can't pick her up.
[190:38.37]What just happened?
[191:06.89]She heals at like 30% Let's try this again
[191:40.14]I wish I could target the person.
[191:42.72]I wish I... I want to target the person I'm... I... Whatever.
[191:45.20]Forget it.
[191:46.32]Forget it!
[191:48.40]Just know that that was me being annoyed there.
[191:51.16]That I need to know.
[191:51.86]Here comes the heal.
[192:11.95]Don't heal.
[192:15.65]Don't heal!
[192:16.59]Is it that easy?
[192:24.91]I don't know.
[192:31.41]I can't tell.
[192:32.57]I think I did it.
[192:39.90]Die!
[192:50.73]Whatever, just keep that up.
[192:53.17]Keep that up and she'll die eventually.
[192:56.57]Yeah, let's finish this.
[193:00.53]I agree.
[193:02.27]Got it.
[193:02.67]Win.
[193:17.11]You beat me.
[193:19.19]I can't believe you actually beat me.
[193:24.07]They never do.
[193:25.93]You know, you don't look so hot.
[193:29.15]Majestic.
[193:30.93]We'll never give up the struggle to resist you alien freaks.
[193:39.32]Struggle's over, babe.
[193:41.43]Huron's won human Zip-a-rooni.
[193:45.57]You think you've won?
[193:48.29]You think America is the only human civilization on Earth?
[193:54.12]That's what all the Americans seem to think.
[193:57.84]At least one guy scanned.
[194:01.56]we're talking about political humor insect there are three billion people on this planet and everywhere there are humans there is majestic sorry doll face without you majestics just a bunch of dudes in crappy black suits majestic
[194:25.42]Only 25%, John.
[194:25.92]I'm going to do the rest of the planet.
[194:38.02]Yeah, it's the 1950s.
[194:39.40]This doesn't take place like four days ago.
[194:41.70]Attention, humans.
[194:44.34]I am Cryptosporidium of the planet Furon.
[194:49.07]This planet is now a territory of the Furon Empire.
[194:58.57]Resist this.
[195:02.01]We were bugged the whole time.
[195:06.04]President found alive.
[195:07.38]U.S.
[195:07.54]government fights off commie invaders on home soil.
[195:12.32]He's a puppet.
[195:13.38]He's a goddamn puppet.
[195:14.98]Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[195:18.15]In recent days, rumors have run rampant of flying saucers, alien invaders from other worlds, indeed, of my own demise.
[195:28.82]The truth is, America has been attacked.
[195:32.38]Not by little green men, but red.
[195:35.60]And our invaders are most definitely of this Earth.
[195:39.55]Despite the efforts of this administration, our nation has been infiltrated by communists.
[195:45.91]Their conspiracy, details of which are only now coming to light, included drugging our water supplies and controlling our media via mind control.
[195:56.05]But your military and intelligence agencies fought back, and I'm proud to report that once again, America has emerged victorious.
[196:06.94]However, the price is dear.
[196:10.02]At this moment, millions of Americans are working hard and playing by the rules, unaware of the lingering toxic pollutants in their minds.
[196:19.91]To combat this lingering menace, we have set up testing sites across the nation.
[196:25.63]At shopping malls, local schools, even churches.
[196:29.67]The test is simple and painless.
[196:32.98]Why, our family had it just this morning, and I'm back at work.
[196:37.16]Doris is in the kitchen baking brownies, and little Billy's out playing tag in the rose garden right now.
[196:43.66]It's completely safe.
[196:46.04]So, trust your government.
[196:48.14]Trust your president.
[196:50.13]Good night, and God bless America.
[196:53.14]You mean the three-piece suit.
[196:54.38]No, it's his pre-shirt.
[197:01.49]Step inside, citizen.
[197:04.67]You sure this thing is safe?
[197:06.93]Step inside, citizen.
[197:10.35]I love early CG.
[197:10.81]It's very endearing.
[197:12.65]There's something creepy and off-putting about it.
[197:15.07]I miss it.
[197:53.40]That was me the whole time.
[197:55.77]Like shooting monkeys in a barrel.
[198:03.61]And so, the world breathes a sigh of relief.
[198:07.37]The threat of alien invasion proved a false alarm.
[198:10.95]As for those who scan the skies for a real visit from outer space, they may be in for a very long wait.
[198:18.33]Perhaps the lesson is that we should turn our gaze inward, remembering that man's worst enemy is often himself.
[198:30.38]Creepy.
[198:33.37]It's an episode of Black Mirror.
[198:34.53]Well, there it is.
[198:37.69]I'm glad I finished it.
[198:49.61]I'm glad we didn't just skip to Destroy All Humans 2, like I was desperately trying to do three and a half hours ago.
[198:55.82]Can I play the second one?
[198:57.50]Yes.
[198:57.86]But I'm not sure that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[199:10.89]Maybe.
[199:11.59]We're the starting Destroy All Humans 2.
[199:13.29]We're going to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[199:14.75]I'm probably going to just start Dark Souls Remastered.
[199:17.87]Because we've had a lot of Destroy All Humans.
[199:21.46]And I really don't want, like, two, three screens in a row.
[199:23.86]And then I'll be in, like, four screens in a row to be Destroy All Humans.
[199:30.86]Oh, and yes, I have to get the Grandmaster in Dota 2 tomorrow.
[199:33.14]Okay.
[199:36.41]Let me pee.
[199:38.35]And that's going to wrap it up for today because I have to go eat and prepare for the official podcast.
[199:48.29]We're recording that in a few hours.
[199:51.49]So I need to go get ready for it.
[199:53.85]I have to go eat, make sure I'm bathed.
[199:58.59]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[200:01.73]Thanks so much for coming.
[200:02.89]Thanks so much for coming out.
[200:05.68]Tomorrow afternoon, we're probably going to start around the same time.
[200:10.32]So just be aware.
[200:12.44]Tomorrow's stream will be probably at like 12 o'clock Eastern.
[200:18.24]Between like 11 and 1 Eastern is when the stream is going to start.
[200:21.86]Another early one.
[200:23.89]So, should have some fun on the podcast later.
[200:29.07]Yep, that is the critical podcast.
[200:34.49]And we'll see.
[200:35.35]I'm sure I'll link to it when it gets uploaded, whenever it is.
[200:39.85]But let me pee and we'll come back and do the credits and the bits.
[200:43.35]You'll be taking off.
[200:44.53]See you later.
[200:44.91]Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[200:47.23]And we'll let these credits play out while I use the bathroom.
[200:49.75]These ones, not mine.
[201:54.24]Thank you.
[203:22.54]Wait, did I miss the secret ending?
[203:28.33]No.
[203:30.81]Was there an after credits ending?
[203:31.77]Okay.
[203:37.00]Let's mute this.
[203:40.26]Go back over here.
[203:41.68]No, that's not correct.
[203:44.62]Alright, so here are the credits.

[210:03.64]And, yeah, I couldn't fucking believe it when I watched it.
[210:09.86]That, like, 30-second bit that I did, somebody made into a full, like, three-and-a-half-minute video.
[210:22.18]Let's see if we get a chance here.
[210:24.92]I'll link it in the chat if you haven't seen it.
[210:26.92]There you go.

[210:39.27]It's Bill crazy.
[210:46.74]Yeah, give it a watch when you get a minute.
[210:50.28]It is exactly what I would imagine that channel would be like.
[210:56.84]That's not a risky click, don't worry.
[211:02.59]But yeah.
[211:03.47]Thank you, Spreo.
[211:07.63]Enjoy that video.
[211:12.53]Radio Vidya, thanks for the $1.
[211:15.43]Thanks for the cool streams.
[211:16.27]I cannot believe I've been watching for two and a half years.
[211:18.55]They said two plus years, but I added a half.
[211:21.36]I remember watching you play Undertale.
[211:24.20]Also, sorry for making you say there once was a man from Nantucket who's... talking about penises.
[211:30.86]But thank you, Radio Vidya.
[211:31.88]Appreciate it, man.
[211:34.57]That Undertale, I think that's one of the first streams I did.
[211:40.47]With a schedule.
[211:42.16]Is it?
[211:42.42]No, that was even before I had a set three days a week.
[211:46.88]I'm pretty sure Undertale was one of my first, like, hey, I'm going to be a streamer now.
[211:51.18]But not announcing it yet.
[211:55.52]So, interestingly enough.
[211:58.56]Avoided, yeah.
[211:59.34]I'm not going to say that.
[212:03.90]The first scheduled stream was Sorcery, so yeah, it was before that.
[212:06.36]That's a long time ago.
[212:10.59]Thanks, man.
[212:13.65]Appreciate it.
[212:15.59]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the $1.
[212:16.95]As an Argentinian, I shouldn't be watching... I should be watching the Iceland versus Argentina right now, but I prefer watching you.
[212:26.52]Heart.
[212:27.28]Also, I don't actually like football.
[212:31.56]Yeah, I think I'm one of the only people in the world that doesn't really watch football slash soccer.
[212:41.54]That is the world's sport, isn't it?
[212:43.50]It's like the most popular sport in the entire planet.
[212:47.28]Everybody's talking about it and I'm just like, meh, that's cool.
[212:51.06]I don't really... Falls.
[212:56.21]It is.
[212:57.01]Yeah.
[212:58.03]Soccer.
[212:59.75]Football is like the most popular sport in the world.
[213:04.62]It's not really that super huge popular over here, but it is.
[213:07.78]It's gaining traction.
[213:10.28]Most of my friends care about the World Cup.
[213:12.84]Most of my friends care about football.
[213:17.02]American football, obviously.
[213:18.54]Like, man, I don't really care that much about that either.
[213:21.23]I stopped paying attention to sports a long time ago.
[213:24.55]At least a few years ago.
[213:26.81]Doesn't really do it for me anymore.
[213:34.49]But, thanks for watching this instead of that game.
[213:37.70]I appreciate it.
[213:39.88]Bro, luck thanks for the $1.
[213:40.72]Are you doing a double stream today?

[215:10.61]Oh, my God.
[215:12.49]He says, why is that dude unignorable and how much a Twitch no-ignore account costs?
[215:20.49]Wait, what's going on?
[215:21.11]What happened?
[215:27.44]Who's unignorable?
[215:30.50]You're talking about me?

[216:07.30]I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.

[219:12.31]Everybody calm down.
[219:21.02]Okay, I'm just making sure this is, like, I'm not gonna say, like, a swear.
[219:25.43]Like, whatever.
[219:26.51]Uh, let's just start it again.
[219:29.63]The lady fair, our love is told, with hair as fine as soft-spun gold, lips as red as sun-drenched dawn, skin as soft as a newborn fawn, eyes as blue as the sea, what my heart can't breathe, help me, ah.
[219:49.62]Did I just summon a demon or something today?
[219:51.20]Am I gonna, like, drown the next time I go swimming?
[219:53.26]Did I just curse myself?
[219:54.22]Is that like a witch's curse?
[220:01.98]Thank you, Lord Irovic, for the, uh, the magic curse that I just said out loud.
[220:10.92]Hey, Bobboy, thanks for the five dollars.
[220:12.40]Hi, Jerma, early streamer today.
[220:16.16]Hope it's going well for you, and of course, everyone here forgives you for the delays.
[220:20.63]Hey, thanks, Bob-Boy.
[220:24.61]Yeah, I was... I've just got random shit to take care of.
[220:28.87]A lot of it has to do with the move.
[220:32.13]Some of it's medical.
[220:33.57]But I'm going to be all over the place.
[220:36.13]Especially... Next weekend is going to be interesting.
[220:42.20]Because... I'm not going to be around.
[220:49.51]So, there are... Just bear with me here.
[220:55.05]I got a lot going on.
[220:56.55]Trying to get it all, trying to juggle everything at the same time.
[220:58.81]So, I apologize if it's a little sporadic.
[221:07.27]No, I'm not gonna be here.
[221:08.15]I'm not gonna be here next weekend.
[221:12.62]I'll be back.
[221:14.66]Don't worry.
[221:15.16]I'm not going away for very long.
[221:20.24]But thank you, Bob-Boy.
[221:21.14]Thank you, Bob-Boy, again, for the $2.
[221:24.42]They're waiting for you in the test chamber.
[221:28.80]Oh, yeah, the Half-Life joke.
[221:31.08]Thanks, Bob-Boy.
[221:33.98]Resurrected.
[221:38.55]Thank you, Cool Cat, for the $1.
[221:40.07]Hey, Jermbo recently got my 12-month sub badge.
[221:43.49]Been watching your vids on YouTube for much longer, though.
[221:45.87]Anyway, thanks for the great year of fantastic streams.
[221:49.28]By the way, after the results of the recent Polygraph stream, I'm pretty sure you're actually a pee-pee-poo-poo streamer now.
[221:57.13]I always was a pee-pee-poo-poo streamer, don't you understand that?
[222:04.27]I've never not been that.
[222:05.83]No, that's not true.
[222:06.73]I've been... I need to just quit while I'm ahead.
[222:09.96]That would be a good idea, Mr. Elbertson.
[222:11.90]What do you think?
[222:14.64]Thanks, dude.
[222:15.02]Thank you, Felix for the 10 bucks.
[222:18.29]Hey, Jerm, a big fan.
[222:19.03]I just got news of your Dota stream tomorrow, and I can't wait.
[222:21.39]I have 4,000 hours in that game, so PM me if you need some tips.
[222:28.92]Thank you, Felix, for the 10 bucks, and let's do a follow-up here.
[222:33.72]What do you think would happen to my channel if I started playing... I'm going to give you a scenario.
[222:41.52]Start playing Dota 2 tomorrow, and weirdly enough...
[222:46.70]I'm really good really good and tomorrow I get addicted to it and I just start playing it every day and streaming it every day at a level at a level that is very very good what would happen to this channel if I played Dota 2 only Dota 2 every day for like a year straight on the stream what would happen
[223:15.67]You think I would lose, like, a thousand people concurrent on stream?
[223:19.79]But I dropped, like, fifteen to- But I would probably drop, like, fifteen hundred live concurrent viewers.
[223:33.58]But- But what if I was really good?
[223:36.10]Right?
[223:39.88]We're talking, like, competition good.
[223:45.12]They are-
[223:45.92]Yeah, there are higher chances of a meteorite hitting Earth tomorrow.
[223:56.82]That's true.
[223:59.83]Yeah, there's actually more of a chance of my blood becoming sentient and leaving my body and putting on a suit.
[224:07.01]That is more possible.
[224:12.75]But, yeah, just was curious.
[224:14.33]It's not gonna happen, but just curious.
[224:17.59]Hey, thank you, Cool Cat, for the $1.
[224:18.91]By the way, have you heard of Devolver Digital's new cryptocurrency, Loot Box Coin?
[224:23.11]It's a real thing.
[224:23.91]I have.
[224:25.51]I mean, I'm not gonna get any.
[224:26.37]Maybe I'll get, like, maybe I'll get one, if it's possible.
[224:31.99]Maybe.
[224:36.53]I have heard of it, though.
[224:38.23]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[224:39.65]I like how the title could also be referring to Dark Souls 1.
[224:43.26]Go to troll, Jerma.
[224:44.64]jermaJex.
[224:48.68]Thanks, dude.
[224:50.38]Thank you, Bobboy, again for the $1.
[224:52.03]Soylent Green is people.
[224:56.09]Wouldn't surprise me.
[224:58.89]That is Charlton Heston.
[225:02.75]In the classic Soylent Green.
[225:07.57]Smith, Smith, thanks for the $1.
[225:08.69]Hey, Germany, you should play EDF 5 when the English version comes out.
[225:11.31]It has giant frogs now.
[225:12.43]Oh, I'm going to play the shit out of that game.
[225:17.03]That game was awesome.
[225:18.31]EDF 4, right?
[225:19.87]The one that was on Steam?
[225:23.49]I feel like I really loved EDF, but I desperately want a real next-gen actual version of that game.
[225:29.70]And if that's coming out, then expect to see a shitload of it on this stream.
[225:35.64]Thank you Bob-Boy again for the two dollars, or actually the four dollars in a row here.
[225:40.03]Uh, gotta use the salsa with those chips.
[225:42.67]And then there's a Twitch clip.
[225:43.81]Let's see what it is.
[225:48.67]It's me playing as, uh, the Furon.
[225:52.90]And it is... I did that a lot.
[226:08.59]Okay, replace this This is an actual alien invasion.
[226:13.21]Think about this.
[226:13.67]Alright without the context of whatever on the screen Imagine an alien just landed outside of my house and the world is being taken over This is the audio that you would actually hear in my house Okay, here comes the spaceship in real life lands explosions everywhere
[226:47.96]that's what I would do I would like scream from I would look for my mom I'd freak it out that's what I there you go this is the audio for a real alien invasion
[227:07.20]laughing while screaming uh thanks dude thank you uh sec Sean that is uh not a dollar oh well uh thank you though thank you risque
[227:27.05]Thank you, Risque Blonde, for the $1.
[227:30.09]I've been waiting for six months for you to play Metro Last Light and the rest of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[227:33.97]games.
[227:34.87]Maybe it's time to jump into those.
[227:37.05]Both Last Light and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[227:38.03]sequels are a huge improvement over their previous games.
[227:40.90]I know.
[227:41.82]I'm a piece of shit for not playing Last Light.
[227:44.68]I was like... I know, sometimes I get like that.
[227:47.10]I get... I don't know.
[227:50.12]Sometimes I just get gnawed into it and... I can... Look, I can crumble real quick.
[227:57.89]I like to play, and I like to have fun, and I like to dick around, and I like to obviously put forth streams that I would hope are worth watching for people.
[228:06.87]But sometimes, sometimes I just crumble.
[228:12.48]And that was one of those times.
[228:15.72]Starting Metro Last Light was a real psychologist study of somebody crumbling in real time.
[228:29.49]So I've gotten over it.
[228:31.29]I'm going to have to go back to it before I play Exodus for sure.
[228:41.49]Vinny started Hollow Knight last week and he's going to finish it before you.
[228:45.19]Well, I didn't crumble with Hollow Knight.
[228:48.49]I just played it like five streams in a row and a lot of people didn't want to see it anymore.
[228:58.12]By like the fourth or fifth stream in a row of Hollow Knight, a large percentage of people were not there.
[229:08.43]And then I was like, oh, I'll go back to it.
[229:09.93]That sounds like fun.
[229:10.63]I'll do it again.
[229:11.13]And then I just, you know, something else came out.
[229:12.95]Something else came out.
[229:13.55]Something else came out.
[229:14.45]It's a great game.
[229:18.77]Is it time to bring it back?
[229:19.87]Maybe.
[229:20.27]I don't know.
[229:21.17]I don't think so.
[229:29.34]Stream Monster Hunter?
[229:30.26]I would do that.
[229:31.42]Don't tempt me with a good time.
[229:35.53]Thank you, Sekshon, for the... Again.
[229:38.29]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[229:44.58]Thank you, Risk of Land, for the $1.
[229:48.72]Sprio, thanks for the $1.
[229:49.94]I like how you said, can I actually probe her unintentionally?
[229:54.78]You're like Alien Probe.
[229:55.80]I'm playing an alien in the game.
[229:57.10]That's not me saying that.
[229:58.24]That's me questioning what the character on screen is doing.
[230:04.49]In the fantasy world that we're watching on the screen.
[230:10.89]Thank you, Bobboy, again for the $3 here.
[230:14.98]Jerma, thank you for being a good person.
[230:17.70]And a genuine nice person.
[230:21.73]I'm glad you think I'm like that.
[230:25.25]I'm glad you feel that way.
[230:29.60]Thank you, Bob.
[230:35.80]You know, sometimes I crumble.
[230:37.90]Sometimes I crack under some pressure.
[230:40.96]But that doesn't mean that... That doesn't mean that I don't want to be a good person.
[230:47.14]I try.
[230:47.56]You know, like anybody does.
[230:52.19]Sometimes I crumble, you know?
[230:56.16]Jeremy will crumble.
[230:59.74]You know what?
[231:00.12]That would actually be a pretty good emote.
[231:03.86]It's just me fucking screaming as a cookie and it's breaking apart and stuff.
[231:09.26]Alright, I'm doing it.
[231:09.92]That's a good idea.
[231:13.48]And everybody's gonna spam it and spam it like the guy's streamer's freaking out and having like a meltdown.
[231:34.10]Replace jermaMustard.
[231:35.28]I can't.
[231:40.24]I don't know what would happen if I deleted jermaMustard.
[231:42.59]I feel like something bad would happen.
[231:46.81]It's at the point where people ironically want to keep that emote.
[231:52.71]Even though everybody thinks it sucks.
[231:55.00]A shitload of you guys will be unironically angry with me if that emote is removed.
[232:10.19]It's literally useless.
[232:11.37]I know, but you understand I've already gone too far?
[232:22.54]I will see a backlash.
[232:27.20]I'm the better yellow emote.
[232:28.36]But that's true, but that's also $10.
[232:29.52]That's a $10 emote.
[232:33.52]Which, by the way, if you didn't see, take a look.
[232:39.65]Look at that one.
[232:41.91]And we didn't see these ones.
[232:44.47]Look at that.
[232:45.49]We got a new emote.
[232:46.29]We got a new planet.
[232:49.05]Look at all these fun things, too.
[232:51.11]Look at this fun interactive thing you can do here.
[232:54.40]Check this out.
[233:00.10]If you get yourself a Jerma985 subscription, you can do fun things like this.
[233:06.96]Look at how wacky that is.
[233:14.01]I have a lot of useless emotes.
[233:16.09]Well, alright.
[233:17.83]Can I be real with you for a second?
[233:23.48]What else would they be?
[233:25.46]You know what I mean?
[233:26.10]Like, what else would they be?
[233:29.16]What else would these emotes be?
[233:30.54]I don't want a shitload of emotes of...
[233:41.18]You guys know exactly... I don't even have to do it.
[233:42.64]I don't even need to talk shit about anything.
[233:46.65]I don't need, like, 30 emotes of, like... Look at my... Look at the expression that I'm doing!
[233:50.97]With, like, a... Oh, facepalm!
[233:52.51]It's me doing it, but I'm a cartoon this time!
[233:55.73]Like, I... I... I... Give me, like, three of those.
[233:59.58]Two of those.
[234:01.74]What other emotes could it possibly... That's why the planets even became into existence in the first place.
[234:06.70]Because, like, I don't... What...
[234:17.78]And that emote of, like, cartoon my face, I specifically, specifically asked to make sure it looks fucking awful.
[234:27.20]I told Blordow, I was like, make it wicked ugly and make it terrible looking.
[234:39.65]That was a criteria for that emote.
[234:45.49]So at the end of the day, it's just...
[234:48.48]I don't know emotes more like when you get to like the 20 30 emote slots they do start to kind of just become the same don't they for the most part just do Pluto
[235:16.85]Or it conveys emotion.
[235:18.05]But I think most of them do.
[235:22.20]Like, oh, why are your emotes so shitty?
[235:24.52]Why are they so ugly?
[235:28.56]There's this weird opinion that I have.
[235:34.04]Where I feel like... I feel like egomania and megalomania kind of takes its shape.
[235:42.16]When you want a bunch of funny, wacky emotes of your face.
[235:47.83]Does that make any sense?
[236:00.47]I'm not saying that word, but it's up.
[236:12.76]That doesn't make any sense.
[236:18.22]Because emotes are somebody else's face.
[236:21.90]That's what the planets are.
[236:22.78]Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[236:24.60]The reason why the planets are so stupid and they don't make any sense.
[236:28.82]I've never even mentioned a planet on any of these broadcasts or any of my videos.
[236:34.64]My purpose with having my face on those planets was to ruin that emote.
[236:39.74]Was to have emotes that were ruined.
[236:51.55]but yeah I don't I just didn't want to do the kind of typical look at me as a look at me I have look at all my look at my face my face it's my face my face my face that's why it took it was painful for me to add like jermaSnort and jermaFear because I typically don't like those emotes
[237:24.24]But one of those was, again, if I take away Dermot Snort, then I'll go to jail.
[237:35.83]Oh, look, it's my face.
[237:41.49]Remove them, then?
[237:42.49]There's no way I can.
[237:51.10]We already went over the fact that you can't remove any of those things.
[238:04.82]Interesting way to be humble.
[238:06.59]It's I mean, I don't think it's about being humble.
[238:08.27]I think it's just I Don't like to put myself up on like that pedestal for like worship Remove them for no balls
[238:34.29]Oh, so, you know, being humble.
[238:38.66]Is that what being humble is?
[238:42.58]I don't know.
[238:43.52]These days, I'm not so sure anymore.
[238:45.20]It works like an ad that gets used on other channels.
[239:05.60]yeah I know and I'm look I'm not I'm not trying to be like standoffish about it or look I'm so look at me I don't take myself seriously therefore I'm so much better than everybody else I personally just it's the same reason why I don't want t-shirts with like Jerma985 on them
[239:33.70]Am I like a guy that wants to do entertaining streams, or am I a brand?
[239:40.75]Because when you become a brand, that's when you start selling people's shit.
[239:44.40]You start selling yourself, essentially.
[239:49.36]I don't ever want to become a brand.
[239:51.56]Ever.
[240:02.61]Hey, gamers.
[240:06.15]You've talked about yourself as a brand before.
[240:07.99]Yeah, but I think in a different context.
[240:21.71]He said it.
[240:26.73]Whatever.
[240:27.65]I can sit here for four hours and talk about this.
[240:36.96]Let's move on.
[240:43.70]Almost done, actually, so... What if I made a movie studio?
[240:50.21]Well, okay, if... I don't... If I made a movie studio, I would be wanting to brand and sell the material, not like me.
[241:01.71]Like it's me you're buyin'.
[241:06.18]I'd rather it be... care about the content, not about, like, the guy that's doing it in a strange roundabout way.
[241:16.41]Turn on the next song.
[241:22.45]Anyways, thank you to Sir Feline for the $1.
[241:28.30]I've succeeded in garnering you additional revenue, Jeremy.
[241:31.96]Where's my cut?
[241:38.66]We'll talk to you after the stream.
[241:44.26]But thanks, dude.
[241:44.70]Thank you, The Great Richard for the... Thank you, Sir Feline for the $1.
[241:52.31]Can't wait to see you on the podcast.
[241:53.49]Good luck.
[241:57.69]I appreciate it.
[241:58.51]Thank you.
[242:00.33]Looking forward to it.
[242:03.55]Thank you, Bobboy again for the...
[242:06.76]The $1, donating to beat Sir Feline and also to recommend you play Half-Life 2 at some point, your free time.
[242:13.62]Because you've not experienced the whole thing and I feel like you're missing out without it.
[242:17.60]How are you doing today, too?
[242:19.56]I'm doing good.
[242:24.09]One day I'm going to have to do like a shut-in where I just play a bunch of old games that I never played.
[242:28.17]The podcast is not going to be live, it's going to be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.
[242:33.86]I think, I'm pretty sure it's going to be on Critical's channel.
[242:37.50]That's where they all go, right?
[242:43.86]But I'm doing well, thank you.
[242:44.74]I hope you're doing well too, Bob.
[242:48.51]Sir Fiendling, thanks for the Vondala.
[242:49.55]I've succeeded in, oh, I just read this one.
[242:52.99]Google and Gareth, thanks for the Vondala.
[242:54.39]Hey, Jeremy, great stream as always.
[242:56.73]Now get back to me about that channel animation.
[242:59.29]I'm so mad right now.
[243:03.67]Oh, right, right, right.
[243:04.51]I'm sorry.
[243:04.87]I've been all over the place.
[243:10.97]My brain sucks, especially lately.
[243:16.74]Oh, it's on Apple?
[243:18.92]I didn't know it was going to be on, like, the Apple podcast.
[243:20.56]That's cool.
[243:22.24]Oh, you got a couple places to listen to it.
[243:27.30]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[243:28.56]Jerma, do you ever think about playing games with your viewers or playing games with Twitch interaction integration?
[243:34.18]Like City of Brass.
[243:37.34]We already did that.
[243:39.86]I played City of Brass with Twitch integration.
[243:42.32]It was a shit show.
[243:48.16]But yeah, I mean, from time... There's... This place is where it makes sense.
[243:53.76]But from what I remember and all the random experience with trying to set stuff up like that, it can get really, really messy.
[244:02.66]trying to find people in the chat who gets to play with you who do you pick subs okay what if you have a bunch of subs who gets to play just post a random fucking number in chat I'm gonna spin a wheel and see who gets to play this game with me in what game you know like I don't play very many strictly multiplayer games anymore so what game would that be
[244:35.09]Dota 2.
[244:35.63]Oh, God.
[244:44.97]I want to play around with extensions.
[244:47.44]I feel like those could be a lot of fun.
[244:49.74]There are some really interesting things you can do with those that I'd like to pursue.
[244:59.45]But we'll see.
[245:02.55]do a World of Warcraft everyone starts at level one and everyone get on the same server when classic wow comes out I think that might actually be kind of fun to just have like 200 people walking around at the same place
[245:23.31]It would just be so awful.
[245:24.77]And again, you don't want to be like that guy that breaks the server and fucks with people's time.
[245:31.39]You know, we're just dicking around and we're up in... Oh, you're at the lumber mill.
[245:37.08]Isn't that funny?
[245:37.82]You got 200 people there.
[245:39.72]There are people that have to work tomorrow and they want to just spend some time in the goddamn game and you got this funny YouTuber and a funny Twitch streamer comes in and crashes the server and I don't get to play.
[245:51.30]You gotta be careful with the, you know, I don't know.
[246:01.57]Try to make a war at the crossroads.
[246:04.59]Try to get like a 500 person battle at the crossroads.
[246:14.08]Worth a thought, though.
[246:23.22]But thank you.
[246:24.44]Appreciate it.
[246:30.55]Bobboy again.
[246:31.29]Thanks, Bobboy, for another $15 here.
[246:35.03]Currently puts Bobboy at number one with just under $50 donated.
[246:40.22]Thank you, dude.
[246:43.90]Thank you.
[246:44.46]Donating to beat him again, Sir Feline, and please have a great day.
[246:47.90]Play what you want.
[246:48.92]Have fun.
[246:49.80]What a coincidence that we're both moving to the West Coast.
[246:54.86]I mean, West Coast is just... More going on.
[246:57.76]I don't think it's better.
[246:59.72]I just think there's more going on.
[247:04.38]Thank you, Bobboy.
[247:05.48]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[247:06.24]Jerma, do you ever think of playing games with your viewers?
[247:08.12]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[247:09.63]We talked about it.
[247:11.79]Getting double notifications here for some reason.
[247:14.41]Or I might just be stupid.
[247:16.19]It's probably that.
[247:18.93]Bobboy, thanks for the $1.
[247:20.35]Can I be a mod?
[247:22.69]Well, mods are selected.
[247:26.49]At random.
[247:28.13]I just roll dice and just pick somebody out.
[247:32.21]No, mods go through... I don't... Nobody can pay to be a mod.
[247:38.66]Nobody... Nobody gets mod.
[247:42.80]It's a very slow process for me.
[247:51.49]Bobboy activated a football giveaway for 54 people.
[247:57.28]What does that mean?
[247:59.58]He just gave away 54 footballs?
[248:04.57]Well, whatever you did, thanks.
[248:08.75]Mod giveaway.
[248:10.27]No, I add and remove mods from time to time just to kind of keep things interesting.
[248:19.65]And a new mod usually takes... I need to know... There's no real criteria.
[248:28.89]it's just sort of are you around a lot do you participate are you are you like you could be kind of insane but not totally insane because I mean I'm kind of insane but no mods are chosen in a different process appreciate the enthusiasm though
[248:56.12]But thank you.
[248:56.54]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[248:58.15]Is the emote contest happening soon?
[248:59.75]Yes.
[249:01.67]The emote contest is going to be formally announced next weekend, right before I leave.
[249:07.99]So you guys have some time.
[249:10.38]I'll give you the criteria.
[249:12.06]I've already talked to all the mods about it.
[249:14.76]We already got a preliminary plan.
[249:17.08]Next weekend, there's going to be five new emotes that maybe you'll make.
[249:24.82]Do not start making emotes right now.
[249:26.63]I know I've seen some people that have already started.
[249:30.45]And they've heard about it, but I would implore that you don't.
[249:34.15]Because there are some rules that need to be followed.
[249:38.62]So I would hold off until next weekend.
[249:40.08]And don't worry, you're going to have plenty of time to make them if you want.
[249:43.64]You're going to have at least two weeks to whoever wants to participate.
[249:48.56]There'll be a voting process.
[249:49.86]We'll vote for them on stream.
[249:51.90]After we narrow some down, it's going to be... There's a whole process here.
[249:56.67]So, next weekend, more details.
[250:01.29]Employ?
[250:01.71]You mean implore.
[250:02.39]That's what I said.
[250:11.50]And open paint.
[250:15.52]Jerma, my suggestion that the 8-year subscriber icon should be a dick pic.
[250:21.87]No, that wouldn't even pass.
[250:23.51]I wouldn't do that in the first place, first of all.
[250:25.21]And then second of all, you can't do that.
[250:29.15]Why would I do that?
[250:30.69]That's like instantly just deleting my channel.
[250:37.72]But thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[250:38.64]Thank you, SmithSmith for the $1.
[250:39.72]Here is a clip.
[250:43.31]What is this?
[250:44.83]What the hell is this?
[250:47.09]This is an old- It says tea break one minute in plain like Times New Roman.
[250:52.87]You gonna be a good boy?
[250:53.57]I just pissed again.
[250:58.01]Great.
[251:01.85]Are you here?
[251:02.23]What is going on?
[251:04.61]Hello?
[251:05.79]Yeah?
[251:06.65]I just peed in my pants.
[251:09.49]Yeah, that happens all the time.
[251:11.29]I do that all the time.
[251:12.33]I'm not kidding.
[251:37.37]Is that a joke?
[251:38.43]No, no, that was... That was me and Star describing peeing.
[251:44.09]We used to talk a lot about piss.
[251:48.61]You guys all do that.
[251:49.75]Don't even tell me that you don't do that.
[251:53.67]But thank you, Smith.
[251:55.17]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[251:56.23]Here, have some more bits.
[251:57.07]Thank you.
[251:57.72]Lord Aravic, thanks for the $2.
[252:00.86]I expect more people to get the joke.
[252:05.30]Uh... What is it?
[252:10.24]We'll be able to get the joke.
[252:11.18]What is it?
[252:15.22]It's a fellow do PSA.
[252:17.80]I don't know.
[252:20.90]I don't know what the joke is.
[252:21.98]The joke.
[252:26.68]What was your last bit?
[252:31.83]The joke.
[252:35.61]Time to take a piss.
[252:41.57]Streamer doesn't get the joke, trolled.
[252:45.91]You just lost the joke.
[252:52.71]Every time you come, the stream is over.
[252:53.77]I'm sorry about that.
[252:55.95]But thank you, Lord Arevik, for the elected YouTube video of people sitting around a table with, like, a Burger King hat on.
[253:04.01]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[253:05.07]If you started playing Dota 2 on stream and were actually good, I'd buy everyone in chat a $25 sub badge.
[253:13.02]That won't happen, don't worry.
[253:17.04]Thank you, Bobboy, for the $1.
[253:18.36]Any chance of getting to play with you in the near future in Left 4 Dead 2 or something?
[253:23.47]Other than the Valve Complete Pack.
[253:24.89]There's not very many multiplayer games.
[253:30.35]Probably not.
[253:31.53]Just because I don't really do that.
[253:37.20]When was the last time I played Left 4 Dead?
[253:40.30]Probably like three years ago.
[253:43.56]Like shibby 2142.
[253:47.82]If I ever do multiplayer games with anybody, you guys will be the first to hear about it.
[253:54.80]But I don't want to get anybody's hopes up and be like, you know what?
[253:57.92]You and I are going to play a game tonight!
[254:00.15]I don't really do that.
[254:06.23]If the opportunity presents itself, I will do an open multiplayer session for whoever wants to join it.
[254:10.45]We've done it a couple times before.
[254:17.96]Oh, tonight?
[254:19.60]I cannot give precedence to one person or the other.
[254:24.14]You know, there's no criteria for being able to play a game with me.
[254:28.72]If I'm going to open up a multiplayer session, it's going to be open to everybody.
[254:32.47]Or whoever can, you know what I mean?
[254:39.45]But thank you, Bob.
[254:41.73]And thank you again for your dollar.
[254:43.01]You both try to succeed and be a good person.

[257:40.83]The big eyes and the face?
[257:44.04]Hey!
[257:56.35]Steam Control, that's the joke in itself.
[258:03.34]You know, I actually thought about, speaking of just being terrible intentionally, right?
[258:08.62]I actually thought of a stream idea to go unprepared with no material to a comedy club and stream my performance trying without any material to try to get something going on stage on open mic night.
[258:28.29]See if I can like piece something together somehow.
[258:32.44]would be so embarrassing I don't even know how it would work I would have to try to do I don't even know but I think a lot of places don't let you film so I'd have to get expressed permission to do that and just see if I could make as many people in the audience as uncomfortable as possible
[259:03.91]And not in like a bad way, but in like a... I don't like this guy.
[259:09.71]And watch me kill it up there.
[259:11.46]Watch me absolutely slay.
[259:14.24]And then all of a sudden, my career takes off.
[259:21.95]I actually feel so bad for you.
[259:23.45]Don't.
[259:23.83]But that makes me want to do it.
[259:30.59]You know, just hire somebody, hire some writer to actually write the material, and go up there and just fucking slay.
[259:38.40]It was a thought.
[259:48.01]But thank you, uh... Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1 football emote.
[259:51.67]Poggers.
[259:53.35]SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[259:54.47]Will you also change the subsound next weekend?
[259:56.55]Yeah.
[259:57.49]Yep.
[259:58.35]Yes, I will.
[259:59.49]Promise.
[260:00.27]100% guarantee.
[260:02.41]There'll be two new subsounds next weekend.
[260:05.47]100%.
[260:05.51]I promise.
[260:07.09]If there's not two new subsounds by this coming next weekend, I will delete my Twitch account.
[260:20.04]Thank you, Stapley, for the $1.
[260:21.56]The Gloom Man shirt was perfect because it was subtle enough that only fans would recognize it.
[260:26.34]but was also a good shirt by itself without context.
[260:29.74]Come up with more stuff like that, I would definitely buy it.
[260:34.36]I mean, that was the idea.
[260:35.50]But... I could get all weird and existential and deep about money and content and creators and stuff, but I can't.
[260:53.29]That's a rabbit hole I can't go down.
[260:56.06]think you all know how I feel it's hard to express it into words though without sounding like an does it I don't know hopefully that comes across as correct but thank you thank you dark star for the one dollar I woke up today to find the window mechanism my car broke
[261:17.40]And the driver's side window was left open all night.
[261:19.61]Luckily, nothing of worth was in the car.
[261:22.03]Anyways, guess I'll be driving around with a duct-taped window for a few days.
[261:25.23]Here's a dollar.
[261:29.17]That's... weird.
[261:34.12]Are you in an area where you'd be concerned that someone would steal something out of your car?
[261:43.40]Glad nothing happened.
[261:47.32]Thanks for the dollar.
[261:49.58]Only a few more here.
[261:50.44]Thank you Felix Felis for the one dollar.
[261:51.90]So after all the Q&As and interviews and the no-clip documentary on Fallout 76, how do you like the game?
[261:58.83]Do you think you'd play it with some of your friends on stream?
[262:00.77]I know you didn't like Fallout 4, but I'm sure you'd have fun in 76 with wacky multiplayer jermaRat.
[262:06.69]I'm absolutely going to play it.
[262:08.81]It looks like it's going to be just like complete nonsense half the time.
[262:14.15]It does look fun.
[262:16.32]I don't know how fun though.
[262:19.08]I mean, that's the problem with a game like that.
[262:20.86]Are we talking like Evolve fun?
[262:23.60]Where Evolve was really cool for like four hours and then I never wanted to play it again?
[262:30.56]I don't know.
[262:31.94]It does look fun.
[262:35.84]But I'm not sure how fun.
[262:42.15]We'll see.
[262:46.75]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[262:49.05]Thank you, Byte, for the $1.
[262:50.41]So if you plan on playing a multiplayer game, what genre do you plan to play?
[262:54.29]What's the ETA on you being on Critical's podcast?
[262:57.19]Because everyone in the comments of the podcast are dying to see you, myself included.
[263:00.79]Well, Byte, it's interesting that you say that because the reason why the stream is turning off is because I'm recording on, I'm going on it today.
[263:10.15]I'm literally leaving this stream to go prepare to go be on that podcast.
[263:14.76]So there you go.
[263:18.08]very soon but thanks dude thank you sir feline for the 17 and one dollar 1701 they say sniperino which puts him at 5001 bits total thank you thank you sir feline for the nearly 20 here and the 50 for the week thanks a lot man
[263:44.24]And finally, Snooze and Copter, thanks for the one dollar.
[263:47.08]Jerma, commission me for a rat shirt design.
[263:49.22]Do it, I dare you.
[263:50.94]I'm gonna do one regardless, screw you.
[263:55.75]You don't- There's a lot of fucking- I just wish there was 50 of me.
[264:00.97]I wish there were 200 of me.
[264:04.21]I would just designate them to do all kinds of shit.
[264:08.06]Half of them would move to Vegas, the other half would- I would have the other half, like, grow vegetables back here.
[264:13.77]That's what they would do for the rest of their life.
[264:19.49]Some of them would, like, travel the world and come back and tell me how it was.
[264:28.27]But whatever.
[264:29.37]Thank you to Bob Boy for the two bucks, and he says, uh, snipe.
[264:34.52]Thank you, Bob Boy.
[264:38.26]And finally, thank you, Darkstar.
[264:40.83]for the dollar here at the very end, might as well spend these last bits.
[264:46.29]By the way, I love your work ethic, and even if you don't feel comfortable going on a rant about content creation, I know you always strive for the best and always want to do more for others.
[264:54.24]Love you to death.
[264:56.66]Thank you, Darkstar.
[264:59.14]And, yes.
[265:00.47]I...
[265:02.33]I get pissed off at myself a lot when I don't think something was fun or I don't think something was interesting.
[265:09.03]It's number one what's on my mind.
[265:10.65]So there's not... I hope you guys understand that.
[265:15.86]I do.
[265:19.58]When I say a lot, I don't really mean a lot.
[265:21.98]I mean that, you know, when things don't work out the way that I want them to or if projects fall through or things that I want to do fall through, I'm just like, I want to do that and I want it to be fun.
[265:43.96]Because that's, at the end of the day, what we're all here for.
[265:49.14]To have a good time.
[265:55.59]But with that, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[265:58.27]Probably going to start Dark Souls Remastered.
[266:00.97]Probably.
[266:01.95]Probably.
[266:05.72]And Bob, boy, thanks to the doll here at the very end, they say snipe!
[266:09.96]Thanks for that snipe.
[266:12.41]Take care, guys.
[266:12.87]See you tomorrow.
[266:14.09]Probably around 12 to 1 p.m.
[266:15.91]Eastern Time.
[266:16.43]Same time as today.
[266:18.29]Goodbye.
[266:19.45]And I'm sure I'll link you to the podcast or I'll tell you when it's out.
[266:24.09]Critical has a YouTube channel.
[266:25.71]It'll be there.
[266:26.35]You'll be able to see it there first.
[266:27.43]So subscribe to that channel if you're not.
[266:30.35]See you tomorrow.
