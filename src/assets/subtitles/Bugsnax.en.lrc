[00:36.76]Daedalus?
[00:40.88]Bugsnax?
[00:42.40]Did I say it right?
[00:44.70]Bugsnax.
[00:46.68]Daedalus.
[00:53.13]That wasn't Mr. Satan.
[00:55.75]No, it wasn't Mr. Satan.
[00:57.23]That was supposed to be like a half-goofy.
[01:01.86]Hold on, somebody has it here.
[01:06.00]Daedalus.
[01:07.80]Daedalus.
[01:09.24]The Daedalus encounter.
[01:11.52]No, the Daedalus is way better.
[01:15.45]You guys ever get a word in your head that you pronounce wrong and you know it's not correct, but you don't care because it's in your own headcanon and that's how you pronounce it?
[01:27.81]That happens frequently with me.
[01:32.26]This game is just putting ketchup on ants.
[01:36.66]That's kind of weird.
[01:37.49]Ketchup on ants.
[01:39.61]Fantasy book characters?
[01:42.27]Yeah.

[01:55.01]Wait, do you actually eat bugs in this game?
[01:56.79]Is this an actual bug eating video game?
[01:59.36]I thought that was just the name.
[02:02.00]Yes, you do.
[02:02.84]You eat insects.
[02:05.04]I guess the game is called Bugsnax.
[02:08.48]It's not called, like, Bug Trapper.
[02:11.90]Or Bug Farm.
[02:13.16]It's called Bugsnax.
[02:16.80]This game is dumb.
[02:21.07]Alright.

[04:16.77]You know what I mean?
[04:17.35]Okay, are we gonna... What are we gonna do here?
[04:19.91]We just got 50 bucks coming.
[04:22.23]No, that doesn't work like that, Jeremy.
[04:27.34]Okay, so what are we gonna do?
[04:28.56]You notice how a lot of streamers and YouTubers, we do that?
[04:31.80]Well, it doesn't work with the money part.
[04:36.75]Split it.
[04:40.39]No.
[04:41.51]No, that was 5,000 bits from Lucas, the unknown.
[04:44.31]Thank you, Lucas.
[04:46.40]And Lucas says, my first ever donation to any streamer.
[04:49.10]Thanks for being here and that I will always support you.
[04:52.38]First ever donation and it's a huge one.
[04:56.50]Thanks, dude.
[04:57.84]For the massive bit drop.
[05:05.79]First ever donation.
[05:10.34]Give me my penny.
[05:14.44]Your bitrate, what?
[05:20.00]One bit per... Alright, can I talk about something for just a quick second?
[05:25.05]You just reminded me of something.
[05:28.64]Okay.
[05:29.52]So, there are class action lawsuits, right?
[05:32.20]Where some company... I got something in the mail.
[05:36.54]Like, I don't know, maybe a year ago.
[05:38.28]And it was like, oh, I just want to let you know that the class action lawsuit for this you've been a part of.
[05:44.16]Yeah, they won.
[05:45.50]They won.
[05:46.06]And you can claim your four or five dollars from the lawsuit.
[05:53.82]I'm just sitting there being like, are you going to send me a check for like five bucks?
[06:01.66]Why don't we just have these guys like rebuild a bunch of schools?
[06:06.62]Instead of sending everybody that was part of the class action lawsuit like a few dollars in a check.
[06:12.22]Just like fucking take like the 400 million dollars and like redo a whole city block.
[06:19.43]I don't want the six dollars.
[06:26.62]We should be able to vote on what happens to that money.
[06:29.91]I don't want the $5.
[06:30.69]I want you to redo a school.
[06:40.41]Lawyer Jerma Sanders.
[06:43.66]That's not that.
[06:44.28]No, it's not.
[06:51.47]That's communist garbage.
[06:53.49]It's not, no.
[06:55.07]Look, it already is doing that.
[06:56.65]They're giving all of us $5.
[06:59.11]I'm just saying, utilize that money in a better way.
[07:01.86]Instead of giving everybody $5, let's redo the fucking, like, a city in a state and just pick one.
[07:12.85]How do you even cash a check for $5?
[07:22.28]I'm going to go in there and be like, ah, yeah, here's my check that I got for $3.12.
[07:27.08]I'd like that in ones, please.
[07:31.53]I'd like that in coins.
[07:34.01]I'd like that in pennies.
[07:39.75]And the person behind the counter is like, whoa, you want that in ones?
[07:42.63]Oh, shit.
[07:44.49]Okay.
[07:45.89]One, two, three.
[07:49.22]Oh, my fingers are
[07:51.67]I'm getting tight!
[07:52.45]I almost want to like mail it back and just write like fuck you on the back.
[08:04.33]Write fuck you redo a school.
[08:14.14]I'm waiting for get on with it.
[08:15.78]Alright.
[08:16.20]Yeah, I'm just telling you like we're talking.
[08:18.18]We're talking here.
[08:19.54]That's lawful evil.
[08:21.85]That's not... Lawful Evil would be, I would try to find a way to get everybody else's check legally.
[08:29.53]That's Lawful Evil.
[08:41.53]Neutral Evil.
[08:43.35]Chaotic based hypers.
[08:45.43]Alright, let's go.
[08:48.04]Long story short, when a class session lawsuit pays out like $4 a person, no, just like, I'd rather you make like a game show and invite on like 25 people that were part of this lawsuit and make it like a $10 million game show and put it on TV.
[09:08.94]Start the game?
[09:09.52]I'm about to.
[09:16.88]Coleslaw suit.
[09:19.10]Alright, does this game suck?
[09:20.60]Anybody know?
[09:25.22]This is based cringe.
[09:26.81]I don't know.
[09:27.25]That's an oxymoron.
[09:28.43]That doesn't make any sense.
[09:31.47]Yeah, it's good.
[09:32.21]Alright.
[09:32.55]This is called bugs.
[09:34.13]That was a lot of... You hear that like... It's Bugsnax.
[09:38.07]Ready?
[09:39.35]I'm ready.
[09:45.81]It's such a good game.
[09:47.95]It sucks, but it's cute.
[09:51.89]I feel like a lot of you say that about me.
[09:53.91]So, should be alright.
[09:58.06]Okay, this is us.
[10:02.16]This is our map.
[10:09.94]What?
[10:13.85]Snacks!
[10:16.35]Move.
[10:17.93]Oh, that's got to come down.
[10:20.55]That's got to come down.
[10:21.41]That's way too crazy.
[10:23.01]30.
[10:25.18]Uh, even more.
[10:34.40]This was made in dreams?
[10:35.46]It'd be kind of cool if it was, actually.
[10:38.94]Alright, let's go with 18.
[10:44.43]18 feels alright.
[10:45.49]Deep, a little lower.
[10:47.06]Still too high.
[10:47.52]14.
[10:51.04]That's good.
[10:56.02]Alright, here we go.
[10:57.48]Gonna raid?
[10:58.83]We raided.
[11:01.45]What's up?
[11:02.71]Raid from... Slime... It actually is a slime raid.
[11:11.92]Slime-sickle?
[11:14.45]Slime-sicle just raided the real slime.
[11:18.53]This is a real slime raid.
[11:23.54]Ooh, spider!
[11:28.16]Let's pick that up.
[11:29.26]But thanks, uh, welcome everybody.
[11:30.24]We just, we literally just, I just turned the stream on, so welcome.
[11:32.88]You're in for a treat.
[11:33.98]Thank you, slime-sicle.
[11:34.70]Hope you had a good stream.
[11:40.77]When are you going to be a slime-tuber?
[11:43.51]I don't know.
[11:48.51]I feel like I'm overusing that.
[11:51.59]Am I overusing the MonkaS?
[11:53.04]I feel like I am.
[11:56.40]I am.
[11:57.02]I feel like I am.
[11:59.32]That's a crutch.
[11:59.84]That's like a comedy crutch.
[12:00.80]And I'm not going to use it anymore.
[12:05.26]Thought I was going to fall.
[12:06.02]First fall joke of the evening.
[12:07.07]Not going to get it here.
[12:10.31]Bug.
[12:10.43]Bug.
[12:14.00]This game is... I don't even know.
[12:15.42]I was gonna say good, but I haven't played it yet.
[12:19.22]That was a pizza.
[12:24.10]That was a flying pizza.
[12:25.40]Is it supposed to do something?
[12:31.76]Two weeks earlier.
[12:32.76]It's voice acted.
[12:38.43]That's what happens when you mix a walrus and a dachshund.
[12:42.99]These are Muffet characters.
[12:45.65]Snacktooth Island.
[13:12.10]Oh, how many followers do you have?
[13:13.10]I don't even get out of bed for anything less than a thousand.
[13:18.04]That was rude.
[13:19.28]Was it?
[13:19.56]Yeah.
[13:19.74]That's wicked rude.
[13:21.34]You're right.
[13:22.34]Yeah, that was incredibly rude.
[13:23.92]Half bug, half snacks.
[13:43.64]No!
[13:44.52]He missed!
[13:44.94]Yes.
[13:46.24]Soylent Grump.
[13:46.70]Are those weapons around the belt?
[13:48.96]Soy.
[13:49.08]Soy.
[13:49.16]Yeah, of course.
[14:15.45]The three-letter word that creates immediate hilarious reaction.
[14:26.76]Press on somebody to talk.
[14:29.52]Oh, how about you?
[14:30.06]How about Clumpy Clumbernut?
[14:33.80]The Justin Roiland name for a character, if I've ever seen one.
[14:39.00]I thought that was a cross around her neck.
[14:42.14]I was like, oh shit.
[14:43.40]Diplomacy only.
[14:44.04]Reader Repulsa.
[14:45.66]Kind of sounds like her, yeah.
[15:08.53]Elizabeth to some grump forsaken island?
[15:11.09]Elizabeth Megafig is either a con artist or a lunatic.
[15:15.88]Remember that whole mess with Grumplantis?
[15:18.28]It's time to conquer Earth.
[15:22.62]You know the best part about that song?
[15:24.76]Not that song.
[15:25.40]That intro.
[15:26.60]Was it pumped you up.
[15:27.60]Because that's when the big build up started to happen.
[15:30.37]That like.
[15:34.21]I got so hyped up when I was a kid.
[15:36.95]When she got out.
[15:38.01]And she starts talking.
[15:38.65]And that fucking riff starts playing.
[15:40.61]Oh man.
[15:41.49]Nothing could wake you up on a Saturday morning.
[15:43.31]More than that riff.
[15:46.41]You guys know that Simon.
[15:48.41]From American Idol.
[15:49.86]Made that song up.
[15:51.97]That's his legacy.
[15:53.89]He wrote that song.
[15:55.89]Simon?
[15:56.69]Yes, it's true.
[15:57.79]Simon from fucking American Idol.
[15:59.79]Simon, yeah, you're terrible.
[16:01.09]That guy.
[16:01.59]He, like, made that song.
[16:03.43]Go look it up, I swear to God.
[16:06.15]Why don't you believe?
[16:06.95]I'm going.
[16:07.31]I don't want to read.
[16:08.79]Who cares?
[16:10.69]Simon Cowell.
[16:11.35]Yes, he did.
[16:12.23]Yes, he did.
[16:15.60]Go, go, Power Rangers.
[16:17.34]Simon Cowell had a ton to do with it.
[16:20.89]You know, nobody did the research.
[16:30.50]Imagine auditioning for American Idol and you do Go!
[16:33.90]Go!
[16:34.08]Power Rangers while just staring at Simon Cowell.
[16:37.26]Like, you know you're going to lose.
[16:38.10]You're going to be one of the joke contestants.
[16:39.44]But, like, not many people will get it, but you'll get it.
[16:41.88]You'll be like, Go!
[16:44.72]Go!
[16:45.04]Power Rangers!
[16:46.58]While staring right at Simon.
[16:49.58]And then, like, when it's all done, you're like, oh, I love that song.
[16:52.12]I really wish I could give gratitude to the person that actually, like, produced it and created it.
[16:57.59]And he would just be embarrassed and pretend like, snack!
[17:00.11]Oh.
[17:09.90]EOV.
[17:10.70]Outer Wilds.
[17:14.30]Yeah, we missed a ton of information.
[17:17.19]But it's okay.
[17:18.09]I feel like the FOV... Is the FOV too small?
[17:22.68]What is it at right now?
[17:23.52]90?
[17:23.78]It's at 90.
[17:24.74]What about 95?
[17:25.54]Did that even change?
[17:29.80]What?
[17:38.53]It's not doing anything.
[17:48.48]Uh.
[17:50.60]There's no FOV difference?
[17:51.76]That's weird.
[17:54.28]Is it broken?
[17:55.22]I feel like it's not 90.
[17:56.22]This doesn't look like 90, does it?
[17:57.31]Doesn't look like 90 to me.
[17:58.87]Maybe do I have to reset the game?
[18:02.55]Turn the game up.
[18:03.93]You got it!
[18:04.87]I say you got it.
[18:05.65]No.
[18:14.03]Oh, this is way too fucking loud.
[18:15.87]I stopped listening to you guys.
[18:17.41]Too bad I'm dying, though.
[18:18.61]Alright, who are you?
[18:22.49]What are you doing here?
[18:23.49]What happened?
[18:25.84]I was looking for you, but I got hungry and I couldn't catch any bug snares.
[18:32.30]Okay, where's Lizbert?
[18:37.50]Mercy killed this guy?
[18:39.87]Wait, you're not Lizbert.
[18:43.81]You're gonna have to put him down.
[18:45.49]Alright, well, looks like you're not gonna make it, Filbert.
[18:51.97]Ah, see you later.
[18:52.85]See you in hell.
[18:54.71]Okay.
[18:54.97]There's a snack over here.
[18:59.27]Scan the bug snack.
[19:00.07]Alright, new assignment started.
[19:02.09]Press F to open the snack scope.
[19:03.52]Oh, cool!
[19:12.95]Grabby, a very simple snack.
[19:14.93]Watch its walking pattern.
[19:17.82]They're a little shy, but that's okay.
[19:19.06]They just need some space.
[19:21.44]Loves, um, coconuts or something.
[19:24.42]Okay.
[19:25.26]Report to Philbo.
[19:27.48]I scanned it.
[19:27.90]Simon Cowell had nothing to do with Power Rangers, you goon.
[19:32.01]What?
[19:33.15]Yes, he did.
[19:43.31]Yes, he did.
[19:43.91]He like produced it.
[19:46.89]He bought the rights.
[19:53.37]Yes, he did.
[19:53.95]He had something to do with it.
[19:55.29]He actually did.
[19:56.01]Okay, you don't have your snack traps selected.
[19:58.49]Hold Q to open the wheel.
[20:00.69]Snack trap.
[20:02.25]Deploy snack trap.
[20:03.67]Catch the bug snack.
[20:05.17]Alright.
[20:05.95]Deployed.
[20:06.39]Oh, I scared him.
[20:09.53]Get out here and get eaten.
[20:32.32]Alright, put that down and hide.
[20:33.88]Where is he?
[20:41.49]Got him!
[20:42.07]Oh shit, I gotta get it before he gets out.
[20:45.49]I got a strappy!
[20:50.92]I'm going to do all these.
[20:52.84]You know I'm going to do all these voices.
[20:54.70]I'm going to do them.
[20:55.33]You know I am.
[20:55.95]I can't help it.
[20:58.17]It made noise.
[20:59.09]I have to.
[21:00.37]Here.
[21:01.01]Have a... Wait.
[21:02.31]Let me talk to you first.
[21:03.03]I kind of want to push you in the river now.
[21:08.75]What the fuck?
[21:19.75]Don't eat those.
[21:20.25]Poison.
[21:22.09]Alright.
[21:22.29]But I wanna do it as if you were birds.
[21:25.80]You're my baby bird.
[21:27.10]I'm gonna chew it up and I'm gonna spit it into your mouth.
[21:30.30]Are you into that?
[21:31.28]You okay with that?
[21:31.90]You don't have your snack trap selected.
[21:34.60]Alright, we need to get three Bugsnax.
[21:50.36]You're a monster.
[21:51.08]Okay, let's get three Bugsnax.
[21:57.07]There's definitely gonna be some in here.
[22:00.67]See any strawberries?
[22:01.39]Alright, I see a peach snake.
[22:06.86]What is that?
[22:10.44]Alright, now go in there.
[22:16.30]Got it!
[22:21.06]It's a root hole.
[22:23.32]Scan it.
[22:23.74]Oh, shit.
[22:24.48]Sorry.
[22:25.37]Alright, now we have to get another... We gotta get two more.
[22:36.61]Didn't scan.
[22:37.21]You softlocked it.
[22:38.23]There's no such thing as a softlock in a Bugsnax game.
[22:44.57]Oh, up there.
[22:46.03]Scan it.
[22:48.96]It's a green wall of latches onto snacks and traps with its unsettlingly long tongue.
[22:53.90]Alright, how do I get that?
[22:59.39]Is there a way I can get that?
[23:00.49]I need two more.
[23:06.97]How do I get them?
[23:11.94]I need a tool I don't have.
[23:13.12]Oh, alright, cool.
[23:13.66]I'm into it.
[23:17.92]Oh, wait, there's another one.
[23:18.64]Alright, hold on.
[23:19.26]Wait, what's a... Oh, I can scan it.
[23:20.86]Scan this carrot now.
[23:22.92]It's a carrot.
[23:23.80]Burrows into the soil when it's scared.
[23:25.20]Alright, let's put this down.
[23:30.84]Put this in your field of view right there.
[23:33.30]And hide.
[23:37.12]What?
[23:39.74]What are you doing?
[23:41.24]Give me that back!
[23:42.54]How do I get that?
[23:47.06]this back.
[23:48.50]Why did you do that?
[23:49.62]What?
[23:50.48]What does it say?
[23:50.86]Press E to get it back?
[23:53.81]E. Retrieve.
[23:57.19]E. E. You're lucky I don't have a fucking gun.
[24:03.89]Alright.
[24:05.18]Get out of here.
[24:14.82]Got two rudels.
[24:16.81]Does this guy like Rudels?
[24:20.03]What kind of food does this guy like?
[24:24.03]You see anything?
[24:24.43]I don't see anything.
[24:28.51]Oh, he hates them.
[24:30.15]Well, I'm sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.
[24:32.10]If you tell me, go get me food, but tell me what you don't want.
[24:35.00]You don't give me the specifics, like your dietary restrictions.
[24:39.40]Like, if you say, hey, go pick up a bunch of food for me.
[24:41.50]Alright, man, I'm... You into, like, uh... You into peanuts?
[24:47.05]Yeah, sure.
[24:49.33]Wait, no.
[24:49.79]Let me redo that.
[24:51.07]Reset.
[24:51.73]3, 2, 1.
[24:53.71]It's like if you got like an... Hold on.
[24:54.89]Reset that again.
[24:56.25]In 3, 2, 1.
[24:57.69]Okay.
[24:59.48]So like if you were to order food for somebody and they just said, get whatever, I don't care.
[25:03.16]And then you come back with like a bag of peanuts and they go, dude, I'm allergic to peanuts.
[25:06.60]What the fuck's wrong with you?
[25:07.54]It's like, dude, you should have told me what you were allergic to before I went and got food.
[25:11.74]Sign it.
[25:12.66]Ship that.
[25:13.48]Close it.
[25:14.37]Cut point right there.
[25:16.86]Thank you.
[25:27.39]Where's the joke?
[25:28.03]No, it wasn't a joke.
[25:28.81]It was like a cool reference to like cut to.
[25:30.75]Alright, I'm gonna feed this guy.
[25:38.60]Mmm, carrots!
[25:40.96]Oh, he's gonna have carrot legs.
[25:43.22]A Family Guy.
[25:46.10]No, it's not a Family Guy.
[25:54.45]Why would that be awesome?
[25:55.25]That would be terrible.
[25:55.99]That would suck.
[25:56.65]Alright, is there any more rudels or strudels?
[26:00.31]Ah!
[26:02.77]Can it.
[26:04.30]Alright, that's the path.
[26:04.96]Go ahead.
[26:06.48]Alright, place that.
[26:07.14]Hide.
[26:07.36]Hide.
[26:12.17]Come on out.
[26:13.55]Grab him.
[26:14.25]Alright, let's move.
[26:15.79]Is he going to have a strawberry leg?
[26:20.58]He is.
[26:22.70]Why did I get that close?
[26:34.08]Isn't one of the gremlins in Gremlins 2 like this?
[26:36.02]The vegetable gremlin?
[26:36.78]Oh, I'm here to investigate the bug snack.
[26:39.57]Stop playing this fetish game.
[26:40.81]Get out of here.
[27:03.56]Alright.
[27:05.36]Let's put this away.
[27:12.28]Anything, uh... You're running pretty damn fast, dude.
[27:16.22]Alright, what's the right hook button?
[27:19.68]Mm-hmm.
[27:22.70]Why not...
[27:34.17]I don't know where Lizbert is.
[27:35.29]I was out here looking for her.
[27:38.07]But who knows?
[27:39.11]Maybe she will be there when we get back.
[27:41.27]Is this the actual mayor?
[27:42.19]She wouldn't want to miss her interview with you.
[27:44.47]Ready to go, buddy?
[27:45.61]Or is this a terrible Halloween costume?
[27:48.59]Like you're the mayor of Flavortown.
[27:50.32]And you're just in a white t-shirt and shit.
[27:53.02]But you get to make the Guy Fieri joke every night.
[27:55.54]And people laugh at it because they're like... Oh, that's funny.
[27:59.10]Okay, I get it, right?
[28:00.64]Alright.
[28:01.58]Through here.
[28:02.82]Yeah!
[28:09.83]So he's like you.
[28:10.59]Why are you playing terrible games two days in a row?
[28:18.20]What?
[28:18.42]This is... Excuse me.
[28:20.18]People love this game.
[28:22.16]This is like a really popular game that people love.
[28:25.56]Look, I accepted yesterday, but not today.
[28:27.72]Nope.
[28:35.04]Is that Chris Metzen?
[28:35.60]It is.
[28:35.72]That's Chris Metzen.
[28:37.06]That's Chris Metzen.
[28:58.75]He's like, he gave his voice to the game.
[29:00.87]He's a blizzard.
[29:01.35]Well, it's better than nothing.
[29:02.79]You want us to die out here?
[29:04.72]No, no, but this garden is just so far away from everybody.
[29:09.46]It clearly says Wumpus.
[29:12.16]Oh, shit.
[29:14.72]I don't quit.
[29:18.34]Now kindly leave.
[29:19.98]Take a ketchup for the road.
[29:21.94]Ketchup?
[29:22.88]Bunga, bunga, bunga, bunga, bunga.
[29:24.90]It's a hamburger bug.
[29:26.22]Darn bunga, get out of here.
[29:30.90]Wait, there's hamburger buns.
[29:32.16]Bunger.
[29:32.34]Alright, press on a nearby sauce farm.
[29:33.76]Alright, let's get some sauce.
[29:35.00]Ketchup.
[29:35.80]Alright, fill it up.
[29:36.76]I have how much ketchup do I need?
[29:38.84]Might as well fill the whole thing.
[30:00.85]Alright, now lower the Bunger into the pen.
[30:03.24]Come on over here, Bunger.
[30:09.10]Bunger!
[30:15.66]Get in there.
[30:19.35]We get to split this, right?
[30:23.75]Bunger, Bunger, Bunger, Bunger.
[30:36.06]I love this cheeseburger guy.
[30:37.54]Alright.
[30:40.08]Alright, check on Filbo.
[30:43.04]Like, fell down here, right?
[30:46.39]They're like Pokémon.
[30:47.43]Did he fall down here?
[30:50.95]Where is he?
[30:55.11]Wait, scan that thing.
[30:55.89]Yeah, scan these.
[30:57.19]Alright.
[30:57.47]It's a french fry bug.
[30:58.36]Climbs onto high walls out of reach, but will come down if it smells ketchup.
[31:02.58]Oh!
[31:10.49]Hold on, let me do this right.
[31:27.70]Got a... Got a Fryder.
[31:30.68]Alright, what about this thing?
[31:34.32]There's something in here.
[31:36.56]Wait.
[31:42.46]What was this one?
[31:42.98]Scan it first before I catch it.
[31:46.38]There's a bush.
[31:49.08]Alright.
[31:51.90]Get out!
[31:54.18]Tasty Enemy Fryder.
[31:55.52]Alright, there's a burger snack.
[31:59.74]Knocks away traps.
[32:00.62]It also tackles anything covered in ketchup.
[32:02.96]Wait a minute.
[32:03.88]Does it now?
[32:07.90]Does it now?
[32:11.22]Come tackle this and break this guy out of here.

[32:24.11]What's that?
[32:29.31]No!
[32:30.17]We went the wrong way.
[32:40.54]I can't catch him?
[32:43.96]Wait, give me this back.
[32:47.13]Alright, cover that and catch up.
[32:49.91]Oh my fucking god, you idiot.

[34:20.18]Alright.
[34:20.40]Where's the, where's Philbo?
[34:22.18]He fell off this bridge.
[34:24.14]Hey.
[34:24.34]Not very nice.
[34:26.29]Oh, there, wait, there he is.
[34:29.39]Do you want some food?
[34:32.44]Oh, uh, don't you worry.
[34:36.26]I'm a little sore, but I'll be a-okay.
[34:39.98]I'm just happy you're getting along with Windus.
[34:41.94]He's having a hard time, and his wife isn't around much these days.
[34:47.15]So, uh, just see if you can help him out.
[34:49.99]I'll stay here until my brain stops hurting.
[34:53.85]I'm sorry, stranger.
[34:55.53]I didn't mean for Philbo to get hurt like that.
[34:59.02]He's right, though.
[35:00.64]I already got two of them.
[35:03.60]You want some?
[35:04.56]Got it already.
[35:06.22]Oh, man.
[35:06.56]Your food has already arrived.
[35:08.18]Your food already arrived.
[35:30.78]I gave him a weapon.
[35:33.98]I got those too.
[35:35.74]Go.
[35:35.80]He wants two of these.
[35:56.37]Are these tomatoes?
[35:57.07]They have tomato, garlic butts, and beef bums?
[36:00.01]Beef?
[36:00.37]I don't know.
[36:01.21]They look like they're garlic and beef and mushrooms and bums.
[36:03.63]How do I get them?
[36:05.69]Okay.
[36:05.95]You got the bug net.
[36:06.89]Now you can pick up Bugsnax when they're stunned.
[36:27.26]Really?
[36:29.28]Oh, shit.
[36:31.12]Let me go.
[36:32.68]Catch this thing with the net.
[36:33.96]Where's the net?
[36:35.22]Where's the net?
[36:38.40]Oh, you don't have to even equip it.
[36:40.20]Alright, so how do I stun you?
[36:42.46]How do you get stunned?
[36:44.83]Get out of here.
[36:47.93]Okay, what else?
[36:49.25]I had to set him up scarecrows to give him something else to tackle.
[36:51.69]Okay.
[36:55.33]Now look at this net that you just found.
[36:59.44]Oh, alright.
[37:00.32]Just look at this net that I just found.
[37:05.46]Okay, I get it.
[37:06.47]Hey!
[37:07.67]How do I catch him?
[37:08.43]Can I... Not on me!
[37:15.07]Idiots!
[37:16.57]Have you ever tried to catch a real life superhero?
[37:28.91]Have you ever used a disguise?
[37:36.25]How do I catch this?
[37:40.35]He didn't tell me how to, like, stun him.
[37:44.32]I just ram into him.
[37:46.54]Ram into his head?
[37:47.14]Hit him.
[37:52.66]Oops.
[37:54.04]Wait.
[37:54.88]Ram into, like, a pole.
[37:57.46]Oh, that didn't work.
[38:01.59]Alright, Bunger.
[38:02.71]Into the wall.
[38:03.21]It didn't work.
[38:09.02]Ram another Bunger.
[38:11.40]Bunger versus Bunger.
[38:16.34]Sounds like a shitty law firm.
[38:17.68]Had Bunger and Bunger.
[38:21.41]We take your case dead serious.
[38:25.07]Alright, hit him.
[38:28.13]Come over here.
[38:28.99]PvP time.
[38:34.51]Go get that.
[38:38.33]Bunger!
[38:42.17]Bunger!
[38:43.71]Bunger!
[38:45.13]I don't think this is gonna work.
[38:53.97]Over there.
[38:57.20]Into a tree.
[38:59.80]Smash into that tree.
[39:02.46]Alright, Bunger!
[39:05.66]Bunger?
[39:05.92]Okay.
[39:08.68]Bunger!
[39:12.04]No!
[39:12.51]Got him.
[39:19.97]Got a Bunger.
[39:21.27]Here you go.
[39:22.21]I got it just for you, man.
[39:39.29]What?
[39:39.95]You should get a hamburger head.
[39:41.99]Justice is served.
[39:44.99]How come when they get bit down on, they don't go like... They'll be back eventually.
[39:50.22]More realistic that way.
[39:55.14]You really mean it?
[39:56.40]Let's get moving right away.
[39:58.24]You know, you're a pretty good hunter.
[40:00.90]Like Philbo said.
[40:02.93]This is a kid's game.
[40:04.09]Yeah, but I mean... Is it?
[40:05.65]It is.
[40:05.93]Well, it's an E for everyone.
[40:07.25]Is Mario a kid's game?
[40:10.01]I disagree.
[40:10.49]I played those cube levels in Mario Sunshine.
[40:14.27]I disagree.
[40:14.59]Yeah.
[40:32.26]Wait, will he get bungered in the face?
[40:37.20]Okay, follow Philbo to Snackburg.
[40:40.80]What's a squeeb?
[40:41.82]Gold camera, that thing's worth a lot of money.
[40:55.94]Is it like a dweeb?
[40:56.79]Like you're a dweeb.
[40:58.63]That's my friend you're talking about.
[41:04.03]Don't worry.
[41:04.45]We'll get our revenge.
[41:05.43]Slow and meticulous.
[41:07.57]What do you know?
[41:25.62]Here, eat this.
[41:26.70]No, you don't get any.
[41:27.64]I'm not giving you any food.
[41:28.34]It's pretty cool toupee hair.
[41:30.46]Uncombed toupee.
[41:31.00]Alright, can I help you?
[41:32.63]No, it's mine.
[41:55.48]okay pick up the journal alright I got all I got the journal we playing solitaire
[42:24.12]Wait.
[42:24.86]You're playing solitaire by yourself in your house, but Filbert is the squeeb.
[42:34.08]Wait, you're gonna call somebody like a squeeb and talk a bunch of shit and you're playing solitaire on the ground in your house?
[42:39.65]That's kind of... That's not okay.
[42:41.25]Let's get a photo of this.
[42:51.55]She's projecting.
[43:02.84]Hi, I've got the diary and whatever it is.
[43:04.86]You're my belly?
[43:07.45]Oh, it tells you what you've caught so far.
[43:13.03]This is cool.
[43:13.97]This is your bugapedia.
[43:16.09]You can scroll through all the Bugsnax you've scanned with your snack scope.
[43:20.84]You can also check on their likes, dislikes, and hints on how to catch them.
[43:25.88]Now check out the other pages to see what they're all about.
[43:29.32]Loves beating human hearts and is afraid of bumper bug.
[43:36.04]Ooh, what's this?
[43:39.82]Loves apple juice.
[43:42.22]Loves, that's like tequila, whatever that is.
[43:46.05]4,900 calories!
[43:46.85]Why are these so many calories?
[43:50.37]30,000 calories?
[43:53.93]You'd be shitting for days.
[43:59.13]36,000 calories.
[44:00.67]The human body doesn't even have like 2,000 calories.
[44:04.71]You take in 2,000 calories a day.
[44:06.57]That's like your total calorie count in your body.
[44:11.13]What is this?
[44:13.46]This is your Grumpedia.
[44:14.78]It's like a Bugapedia, but for Grumpuses.
[44:18.82]This blank space will fill up with your notes once you get to know each Grumpus better.
[44:24.68]Self-appointed mayor, he seems to be trying his best.
[44:27.04]Right, he loves this person.
[44:31.14]Oh, he hates you.
[44:32.66]Why do you hate her?
[44:34.26]What do you hate?
[44:36.48]You hate everybody.
[44:38.34]A sharp-tongued socialite snoop, my bestie apparently, likes gossip, photography, and breaking and entering.
[44:47.33]Okay.
[44:48.09]Why do you hate him so much?
[44:51.97]Have I met this person?
[44:53.57]Oh, Lizbert.
[44:54.29]Okay.
[44:56.86]This is your clues page.
[44:57.84]It's where you'll keep all your progress in finding Lizbert.
[45:00.00]I don't give a shit about that.
[45:01.10]I want to get interesting bugs.
[45:04.44]There's clues here.
[45:06.18]A report on Lizbert's discovery of Bugsnax.
[45:11.41]What's this?
[45:13.01]This is your quest list.
[45:14.51]You can get in-depth info on all your ongoing quests.
[45:17.93]You can also pin a quest to keep it visible while you're walking around.
[45:21.77]Oh!
[45:24.37]This is your snack pack.
[45:25.67]It's where you keep the Bugsnax you've caught.
[45:30.91]This is your map of Snarktooth.
[45:33.47]It's a map.
[45:36.80]This is your list of tools.
[45:38.18]Just a way to keep track of all your snack catching gear.
[45:47.00]Oh, you thought it was going to be another one.
[45:50.34]Oh, alright.
[45:51.00]Now what?
[45:52.58]Okay.
[45:52.72]Bilbo?
[45:53.04]I'm ready to follow you.
[45:54.40]BING!
[45:54.66]Crit sound.
[46:23.45]Why was he bent over like that?
[46:35.76]How come there was never a slingshot added to TF2?
[46:39.40]Don't you feel like that could be like a scout primary that they just didn't capitalize on?
[46:45.71]It's a regular old ghost town.
[46:54.40]Not primary.
[46:58.38]I think it could work.
[47:03.58]That's the Huntsman.
[47:05.18]No, no, no, no.
[47:05.74]Different.
[47:06.66]Alright, so do we live in Snackburg?
[47:14.81]When do the side effects of eating those bug drugs wear off?
[47:17.95]Because he still has those body parts.
[47:20.83]Does it ever wear off?
[47:22.33]Or is that just who you are now?
[47:35.90]I'm sorry.
[47:36.72]I guess you're not going to get that interview with Lisbert just yet.
[47:43.03]Why don't I interview you?
[47:47.49]Awww.
[47:49.03]Okay.
[47:56.28]This is where I say, here we go, we're recording.
[47:59.70]I turn it off.
[48:00.76]And we just have a little conversation.
[48:01.86]And I say, yeah, maybe I'll use that somewhere.
[48:04.20]Okay, uh, hey.
[48:09.58]Who are you?
[48:10.91]I'm Philbo Fiddlepie.
[48:12.77]I guess I'm sort of like a deputy mayor.
[48:16.64]I don't know.
[48:17.84]I'm not good at most stuff.
[48:19.50]Big quotes, deputy mayor.
[48:25.40]What else?
[48:25.92]Why did you come to snack to the island?
[48:27.80]Well, Lizbert asked me to tag along, so I dropped everything and here I am.
[48:35.18]Simon Cowell, what?
[48:37.91]Hey, how do you feel about bulk snacks?
[48:40.68]Until you come down.
[48:41.25]What do you think about that?
[48:56.10]Oh, Lizbert and me go way back.
[48:59.10]Lizbert was, is awesome.
[49:01.87]She always knew what to do, and she brought out the best in all of us.
[49:06.77]Ooh, Mitch McConnell.
[49:08.67]Oh, what?
[49:09.65]Why?
[49:10.11]Does it make any sense right now?
[49:15.53]Okay, so that's how you became mayor.
[49:17.65]I mean, I wasn't really in charge.
[49:21.64]You're a deadly side effect.
[49:22.86]Nobody took me seriously.
[49:25.21]But as long as Lizbert came back- His eyes are like all purple and red.
[49:31.81]One day, Lizbert went out hunting and she didn't come back.
[49:37.12]I tried to step up and keep everybody calm.
[49:39.64]Technically, I was in charge, right?
[49:41.34]But that didn't last long.
[49:47.19]Okay, why didn't it last long?
[49:49.00]Isn't that how the dinosaurs died?
[49:50.16]I think we're done.
[50:07.02]I feel like that thing's gonna pop up and shoot me in the face.
[50:10.73]Alright.
[50:32.27]Okay.
[50:32.37]Okay.
[50:32.51]You've got several quests to active.
[50:33.79]You can check your quest in the journal and pin the one you want to have appear in the corner.
[50:38.21]I've got a couple of quests.
[50:39.79]Alright.
[51:01.25]I just turned his leg into a piece of meat.
[51:09.02]I'm gonna transform.
[51:09.94]These are just fucking terrible experiments I'm doing to these people.
[51:12.84]Okay, we can either find Gramble or go back to Becca.
[51:20.65]No.
[51:21.99]No, I don't want... Becca sucks.
[51:23.83]I want Gramble.
[51:26.37]Let's remove one of those letters.
[51:27.65]Big fan.
[51:31.12]This is locked.
[51:35.52]All this stuff is locked.
[51:36.24]How do I break into people's things?
[51:42.59]Stop right there!
[51:43.57]You violated the law!
[51:46.83]I go to the beach?
[51:56.73]Simmering- simmering springs.
[51:58.43]Oh, that's not the beach.
[52:02.90]Is it?
[52:06.05]You didn't say criminal scum.
[52:07.21]-2.
[52:07.87]Yeah, I'm just trying to keep you on your toes.
[52:09.15]Alright, is this Gramble?
[52:11.65]Yeah.
[52:20.33]You're not Granville?
[52:20.97]Who are you?
[52:21.35]What's that dog with the big teeth that does that?
[52:46.26]Who is Egabelle?
[52:47.14]A local physician.
[52:48.44]Lisbeth's companion.
[52:50.06]Very likely deceased.
[52:51.88]Silence yourself and listen.
[52:54.50]Bulldog, yes.
[52:54.88]You've quickly witnessed grumpus limbs transforming into Bugsnax.
[52:58.30]I call this process snackification.
[53:01.84]Under normal circumstances, this occurs at random.
[53:05.40]However, I have developed a method to direct the effect to specific limbs.
[53:10.59]It's simple once you understand the internal mechanism behind the molecular dissemination of snack particles.
[53:19.15]This is the snacktivator.
[53:20.93]What?
[53:21.87]Look at these arms.
[53:34.62]Don't say it.
[53:35.40]I didn't even... What am I supposed to do?
[53:37.24]Left foot?
[53:38.12]But I can choose what kind of weird experiments to do?
[53:40.51]I don't even know what that is.
[53:42.27]I read it.
[53:42.57]I don't know what that is.
[53:43.25]I just read things.
[53:44.13]I'm a reader.
[53:44.55]Where did you go?
[53:45.05]Where did you just go?
[53:46.51]Oh, this is chocolate.
[54:02.08]You have more than one kind of sauce.
[54:08.32]What's that thing?
[54:10.64]It's a long nose.
[54:12.79]It follows things that it likes.
[54:14.87]And it nudges them with its spoon.
[54:21.09]Let's take it.
[54:41.82]Got it.
[54:44.76]You have more than one kind of sauce.
[54:47.02]Select your sauce slinger and then click the sauce you want.
[54:51.79]Chocolate sauce.
[54:54.55]Nice.
[54:54.81]Alright, what does that weird lady want me to do?
[54:57.37]Want me to do something, right?
[54:59.97]Ooh, look at all these, uh... strawberries.
[55:02.77]Alright, hold on.
[55:04.35]There's a lot of strawberries here.
[55:05.21]Okay.
[55:12.06]Scan.
[55:12.36]I already scanned the strawberries.
[55:15.62]I mean, there's a floating margarita.
[55:20.15]Oh, shit.
[55:20.63]Catch it.
[55:26.37]Oh, this is their nest.
[55:27.25]I'll get, like, ten here.
[55:35.21]Oh, crab.
[55:37.65]It's a crapple.
[55:39.98]This curious snack likes to dig things out of the sand and bring them to its lair.
[55:45.91]Oh, it's an apple crab.
[55:47.35]Okay, so can I catch you with this?
[56:00.00]Get the crab?
[56:00.70]I mean, I'm going to try.
[56:02.48]Maybe I have to net him.
[56:03.18]I kind of want one of the dancing margaritas.
[56:11.98]Seashell.
[56:12.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[56:13.66]Wait.
[56:16.50]Get in there.
[56:20.91]What?
[56:21.03]Does it like chocolate?
[56:26.79]Who likes chocolate?
[56:30.89]Anybody like chocolate?
[56:37.22]Oh, he loves chocolate.
[56:38.30]Hey!
[56:38.42]Hey!
[56:41.85]Put that down!
[56:44.95]Oh, wait, okay, I can get him.
[56:47.19]Chocolate, and then... Grapple.
[56:55.55]You pick up seashells?
[56:56.89]Oh, wait, I can.
[56:57.81]What can I do with the seashell?
[57:02.25]Alright, get the Weevil.
[57:07.37]I can have six?
[57:10.39]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[57:11.73]Seashells- She sells seashells by the seashore.
[57:14.31]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[57:16.19]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[57:18.10]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[57:19.88]Almost.
[57:22.08]Sometimes I can get it.
[57:22.78]What's that?
[57:24.42]There's a ball in there.
[57:31.37]Oops.
[57:33.01]Find Gramble on the beach.
[57:36.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:36.78]There we go.
[57:37.92]A snackery.
[57:38.90]Leaps in and out of the ocean.
[57:40.00]Needs to be caught in mid-leap.
[57:41.46]I don't have a way to get that.
[57:45.25]Wait, can I like frisbee this and hit it in the head?
[57:49.59]I probably can.
[58:06.18]Dammit.
[58:09.48]Alright, where's Gramble by the beach?
[58:14.14]Gramble?
[58:16.02]Wait.
[58:16.78]Do you like chocolate?
[58:17.78]What's that thing?
[58:20.48]It's a Pinutella.
[58:22.68]It burrows into the sand to hide.
[58:24.59]Perhaps another bug snack could dig it out.
[58:27.67]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:28.79]Okay, so the crab digs that out and I can catch them both.
[58:32.31]No.
[58:34.27]What do you like?
[58:38.25]Loves chocolate.
[58:39.53]Okay.
[58:40.83]Here we go.
[58:41.99]I'm going to use you for my own benefit.
[58:44.63]I'm going to coat this with chocolate.
[58:51.18]No.
[58:51.42]Get away.
[58:53.12]Get away.
[58:57.50]Dig him out.
[59:03.83]Dig him out.
[59:04.37]Go.
[59:05.99]Go.
[59:09.20]No!
[59:10.23]Alright, well, whatever.
[59:10.87]I got you.
[59:12.63]Just... Oh, my inventory's full.
[59:14.77]Can I eat them myself?
[59:16.93]Shit.
[59:17.31]I gotta feed somebody.
[59:18.23]What do I do with the bugs?
[59:18.93]What do I do with them?
[59:25.91]Can I eat them?
[59:32.44]We have to find Gramble.
[59:33.72]Find Gramble near the beach.
[59:39.52]The fuck is this person?
[59:48.17]Near the founder.
[59:49.71]There's scramble and then there's somebody else.
[59:52.93]Wiggle.
[59:54.87]This is KK Slaughter.
[59:55.87]I can't wait for like the...
[60:02.39]I'm sorry to interrupt but
[60:26.63]Wiggle, your song's nice and all, but you're scaring the little ones.
[60:32.39]Sorry, Graham.
[60:32.85]You gonna eat those?
[60:34.43]Inspiration is so hard to find.
[60:37.06]I just have to sing wherever it strikes me.
[60:41.18]I feel that way, too.
[60:42.52]I like this character.
[60:43.46]Maybe it could strike you over there.
[60:46.02]Oh.
[60:48.22]But I'd hate to go alone.
[60:51.34]Won't you join me for a long walk on the beach?
[60:56.16]Like a date?
[60:58.44]Of course, darling.
[61:00.59]It would just be you, me, and your delectable stragglers.
[61:05.75]Why is this just some... Singing the night away until we drift off to sleep.
[61:09.93]SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff.
[61:12.85]Sorry.
[61:15.13]Artist depiction of the new... Yes it is.
[61:18.29]What the fuck is this?
[61:20.34]It's a fun game!
[61:21.24]For kids!
[61:22.24]Okay?
[61:53.02]Alright.
[61:53.36]Hey, Gramble.
[61:53.98]What's up?
[61:56.06]Oh.
[61:56.38]I was looking for you.
[61:57.70]This is when I just put my head to the side and just drop a fucking snack bug right in my mouth.
[62:17.90]Eat him Bugsnax and make him eat one.
[62:49.02]Oh shit, I can't... I can't carry anymore.
[62:55.37]Monkey ball.
[62:56.69]Have a ball.
[62:57.97]Alright, guide the buggy ball through the course.
[63:00.15]You got the buggy ball.
[63:00.83]Switch to it with Q. Buggy ball.
[63:02.17]Guide it.
[63:21.23]This is so cool.
[63:22.01]Keep going.
[63:28.21]You can do it.
[63:30.49]You can do it.
[63:31.61]Oh, that's the worst part of the Wario level in the N64 Mario Kart.
[63:35.44]I know.
[63:35.72]Nice work, though.
[63:37.20]Keep going.
[63:37.64]Nice.
[63:40.46]Keep going.
[63:40.96]You're almost there.
[63:43.76]Up there.
[63:45.76]You did it.

[64:15.82]Wait, and pick up this guy and eat him?
[64:18.32]Alright, but I have, um... I have too much stuff in my inventory.
[64:23.38]Do I have a storage unit or something?
[64:27.24]How do I... How would I... Wow.
[64:32.18]I want that one.
[64:33.76]Release them.
[64:34.61]Release them.
[64:35.23]No!
[64:35.77]They're mine.
[64:43.43]Feed the dude in town.
[64:47.47]What?
[64:51.81]Alright, I'll release... Okay.
[64:54.39]I will release one of each.
[65:03.76]We're doing it fair.
[65:04.98]I'm picking them at random.
[65:08.10]Fair.
[65:14.36]Okay, now I need to get three of these guys, of his peel bugs.
[65:17.93]He said there's randomly, they're in holes on the beach.
[65:23.83]Holes on the beach.
[65:28.21]Peel bug.
[65:30.38]You eat them.
[65:31.14]I don't know how.
[65:31.62]I didn't learn how to do that.
[65:35.62]Is that a peel bug?
[65:36.92]No, that's a, that's a pineata.
[65:41.67]Holes on the ground.
[65:49.66]Gigantic bits.
[65:50.68]Oh, shit.
[65:52.06]Gigantic bits did come in.
[65:53.52]And also... Let's start with Red Lemonade gave five community subs, but they were tier two.
[66:00.54]That's tier two community subs from Red Lemonade.
[66:03.49]That's nuts.
[66:04.79]Thank you for those.
[66:06.09]And then 10,000 bits.
[66:08.81]A hundred bucks in bits from... I'm... I'm Omo89.
[66:13.43]Thank you, Omo.
[66:17.46]Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[66:21.61]Yerma, thanks for all the constant entertainment throughout all these years.
[66:23.73]It's impossible to quantify how much happiness you've provided, so consider this a small token of my appreciation.
[66:32.11]I... You're never under any obligation to give me a cent.
[66:35.87]Though, you just hanging out here is enough for me.
[66:44.20]Thank you nonetheless, and happy to have you.
[66:49.24]Now let's kill some bugs!
[66:53.84]Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[66:54.88]It's a lot of money.
[67:02.04]I don't see any holes on the beach, do you?
[67:04.51]Wait.
[67:05.25]Like, is that a peel bug?
[67:09.01]Catch lost peel.
[67:10.17]It's definitely that.
[67:10.85]It's like the basketball bug.
[67:14.23]That's a peel bug.
[67:15.53]It rolls up and hides inside holes or logs.
[67:17.40]They'll have to be pushed out somehow.
[67:19.70]Oh, I know what to do.
[67:22.58]Wait.
[67:26.74]Oh shit!
[67:27.40]Alright, hold on.
[67:27.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:30.46]Alright, push him out.
[67:33.56]Come here.
[67:39.86]Oh, wait.
[67:40.46]Is there a way I can quickly activate this?
[67:41.84]Instead of switching?
[67:45.58]Or do I have to switch to it?
[67:47.54]Alright, there's one.
[67:51.00]Get away from me.
[67:58.55]Looking for another peel bug.
[67:59.31]I like the orange peel bugs.
[68:00.63]They look delicious.
[68:01.51]Is there a peel bug in there?
[68:08.92]Nope.
[68:09.20]Just a squidward.
[68:12.84]Number keys are tools.
[68:13.86]Oh, okay.
[68:14.10]Come on over here.
[68:18.15]I need you.
[68:18.51]Come here.
[68:31.12]Come on over here.
[68:38.73]Outside of memes, how good is this game?
[68:42.21]It's kind of good.
[68:44.63]It's just relaxing and fun.
[68:48.20]This is a chill game.
[68:49.16]I like it.
[68:54.41]What about Elden Ring?
[68:56.83]What about Elden Ring?
[68:57.69]I haven't played... I'm not currently playing Elden Ring.
[69:04.55]Come on, I need one more.
[69:08.29]True, true, true.
[69:09.49]What do you mean true?
[69:16.50]Do I have to reload the area?
[69:17.42]I don't see any more orange bugs.
[69:26.81]Where are they?
[69:30.23]Hello?
[69:35.05]You only needed two?
[69:36.15]No, I need one more.
[69:43.55]Look around more, you dingus.
[69:46.85]I'm, you know, on the beach.
[69:47.71]What are you talking about?
[70:01.67]Every time I see a mean comment, I'm going to do Clefairy.
[70:08.73]In here?
[70:08.99]There's definitely one in here.
[70:14.51]Fuck off.
[70:15.06]Oh, yeah?
[70:15.78]Clefairy.
[70:16.66]How does that sound?
[70:17.32]Oh, another one.
[70:18.38]Clefairy.
[70:19.86]Oh, another one.
[70:20.68]You call me a dickhead?
[70:21.94]Clefairy.
[70:24.30]I can go all day.
[70:33.31]Elmo Clary.
[70:35.71]I've got your snacks.
[70:36.84]You are the embodiment of the stinky cheese emote.
[70:43.44]No, I'm... What?
[70:44.98]How?
[70:45.64]Explain.
[70:46.14]Why do I get that, but I don't get it?
[70:48.77]Get out of here.
[70:49.39]That's bullshit.
[70:49.73]I thought this guy didn't like eating these things.
[71:03.96]Sauce buggy ball with chocolate.
[71:05.72]Lead two Kweebles to grumble without trapping them.
[71:09.74]That's fun.
[71:10.26]Alright, come on!
[71:13.35]Come on, Kweeble!
[71:18.37]You.
[71:20.51]Get over here.
[71:21.97]Chocolate.
[71:29.69]Alright.
[71:31.05]Come get it.
[71:32.30]Where are the Kweebles?
[71:39.24]He loves it.
[71:41.04]Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[71:43.90]It's bacon.
[71:47.19]It's bacon.
[71:51.79]Bacon, bacon, bacon.
[71:55.53]Dogs don't know it's not bacon.
[71:57.23]It's bacon.
[72:02.18]Get in there.
[72:05.62]I used to love that commercial when I was younger.
[72:07.42]I thought it was the funniest goddamn thing in the world.
[72:11.42]It was like the GoPro POV of the dog nose running around going, beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'.
[72:16.67]It's such a great commercial.
[72:23.85]Beggin' strips, yeah.
[72:28.50]Show it?
[72:30.12]Hold on.
[72:32.83]Dogs don't know it's not bacon.

[75:39.48]It actually does sound like John Madden.
[75:44.64]What if it was him?
[75:52.72]It's John- Get away from my ball!

[77:10.89]I'm so happy I could cry.
[77:13.38]Here goes.
[77:21.46]I'm ready to head back to the ranch.
[77:23.52]Thanks for all your help.
[77:25.56]I want you to take Sprout with you.
[77:27.54]He's always wanted a life of adventure.
[77:29.69]I'm just holding him back.
[77:32.46]Sprout, your papa's got it.
[77:37.91]It's really loud now because I turned it up.
[77:39.91]Yeah, we're good now.
[77:40.53]A little bit lower.
[77:42.19]We're good.
[77:42.71]Is there oxygen in there?
[77:52.62]I'll miss you something fierce, but it's okay.
[77:55.66]You can come see Papa anytime.
[78:01.10]You take care of Sprout or else.
[78:05.74]Okay, go see what Befica wants.
[78:10.24]Look at this.
[78:12.40]Cool.
[78:15.42]Look at this little happy family.
[78:31.28]Throw the sprout in the ocean and never come back.
[78:41.24]Um... Uh, this guy here, right?
[78:47.18]Yeah, that guy.
[78:49.98]There he is.
[78:50.72]That's the one.
[78:52.98]Uh, I'm going good.
[78:53.96]And I've got something for you.
[78:55.72]I've got a crab apple treat for you.
[78:59.07]You're gonna love it!
[79:00.31]Ow!
[79:04.40]Oh, wow, that looks uncomfortable.
[79:10.37]Hey, come here.
[79:11.09]Let's make you even more of a monster.
[79:12.83]I gave him huge teeth.
[79:26.48]So is this like the way to show your wealth in this society?
[79:30.66]Is this a guy with a bunch of fruits all over him and vegetable noses and stuff?
[79:34.32]Is that kind of like the top hat of this society?
[79:38.67]The people that are walking around with just regular clothes and no fruits, they're like lower on society.
[79:47.57]Another fine day behind us.
[79:50.33]Well, well, well.
[79:52.19]Look what the snack dragged in.
[79:54.87]Oh, I wouldn't have come back if I knew you were here.
[79:58.54]We've got some drama.
[80:00.26]Well, I ain't about to leave now.
[80:04.16]You made that man an elite.
[80:06.92]Then I reckon we're neighbors again.
[80:09.96]Not really.
[80:12.32]I had that guy win a car on a game show.
[80:15.90]But he didn't realize that you have to pay taxes on the car.
[80:18.66]Charlie, where'd you run off to?
[80:24.38]Don't ever take the car on a game show if you're ever on one.
[80:26.72]Take the money.
[80:30.12]Okay, you guys have a problem.
[80:31.54]What is it?
[80:32.64]Oh, let's interview this guy.
[80:33.32]Okay, who are you?
[80:33.78]Okay, and why did you come to Snark to the island?
[80:53.24]Okay.
[80:54.02]And, uh, why did you not do a farm back home?
[81:03.35]Well, I didn't take the house on the game show like you did.
[81:05.55]Thoughts on Bugsnax?
[81:07.81]Uh, and, uh, what's so confusing about them?
[81:19.85]Well, they ain't animals and they ain't plants.
[81:24.09]It's Arthur Morgan.
[81:25.03]No organs, no seeds, nothing.
[81:28.27]And you have to eat them raw or they turn to mush.
[81:31.97]I call that confusing.
[81:33.43]Well, eat them raw or that's the really nice way to say eat them alive.
[81:39.53]Well, when Lisbert vanished, I knew we needed a reliable food source.
[81:45.36]Without snacks, I figured I'd farm sauce as an alternative.
[81:49.80]Sauce?
[81:50.02]Though we would have been fine on Bugsnax if it weren't for Gramble.
[81:55.37]Now, uh, what?
[81:56.61]Explain to me the problem with Gramble.
[81:58.37]That weepy little rancher thinks all Bugsnax are his pets.
[82:06.63]Why did I do that?
[82:09.35]Why did I do that?
[82:09.91]That was weird.
[82:10.45]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[82:26.35]Okay, did my noise gate not pick up what I did?
[82:31.61]Good.
[82:32.39]Okay, good.
[82:34.15]Good.
[82:34.59]Okay, that's good.
[82:35.95]Okay.
[82:36.79]Thank God that's not recorded.
[82:38.17]We're good.
[82:38.57]Thank God.
[82:39.87]Thank God.
[82:53.36]I'm so happy that that didn't get recorded.
[82:59.62]What did you do?
[83:03.06]Well, you must know.
[83:05.80]Right after that sound happened, I waited about like a half a second, and I went... It was disgusting.
[83:20.76]Or plants for Dr. Batternugget to fix his medicine.
[83:26.76]Oh, that's the town doctor.
[83:28.56]You know, Eggabelle.
[83:30.02]Liz's partner.
[83:33.14]Worse?
[83:34.66]Well, that's why I'm glad it didn't get picked up.
[83:36.51]Because, look, it's fun to talk about it, but it's not fun to live it.
[83:41.43]Could have slipped and fell.
[83:43.21]Okay, snooze.
[83:44.27]Boring.
[83:44.83]Thanks for your time.
[83:47.88]Seems like a waste of your time.
[83:50.36]If you want answers, you need hard evidence.
[83:53.65]Here, I dug this up the other day.
[83:56.79]I'm thinking it might help you find Elizabeth.
[83:58.79]What is this?
[84:00.39]Now, back to work.
[84:04.14]Wampus gave you notes about a strange device.
[84:07.32]Ooh.
[84:09.28]Strange device.
[84:10.50]Now we're getting intriguing.
[84:12.50]What the heck?
[84:16.98]What is this?
[84:19.39]Let me see.
[84:21.13]Ooh, an activator.
[84:24.55]I have this?
[84:27.65]Where's my... Okay, where is it?
[84:31.44]Okay.
[84:33.04]The door is attached to some ancient mechanisms.
[84:36.50]It looks like it might take at least three grumpuses to activate these.
[84:41.88]Okay.
[84:46.33]Why are you... You know what's funny?
[84:49.02]I could, it doesn't matter what game I'm playing.
[84:51.54]It's so, I always like think it's funny to look over here and say, somebody just writes, why are you playing this?
[84:59.53]I don't know.
[84:59.97]Like why do anything?
[85:07.01]That happened.
[85:07.49]Okay.
[85:07.83]At least a few times a stream, I'll look over here and just see why are you playing this?
[85:13.89]It's like, I don't know, man, because video games release and I play them when they come out sometimes and I just play games like I... What are you... I don't know.
[85:22.03]Oh, you know what?
[85:22.59]One of my other favorite ones.
[85:23.79]Why are you still playing this?
[85:25.71]Is another good one.
[85:29.50]I get like, man, I came back from like a shower.
[85:31.28]I like took a shit and went out with my friends and I came back.
[85:33.88]Why are you still playing this?
[85:35.58]I don't know, man.
[85:37.56]It would have been nice to go out with your friends, huh?
[85:40.56]I'm trapped here.
[85:41.92]Here's to a hard day's work.
[85:46.56]You need help.
[85:47.04]Go outside.
[85:47.44]That was everyone last stream.
[85:49.26]Yeah, that had to have been the most.
[85:50.68]Ever.
[85:50.82]Of the, like, why are you still here?
[85:52.24]You're torturing us.
[85:53.52]We don't talk about yesterday's stream.
[85:55.45]Okay?
[85:55.67]Yesterday's stream.
[85:56.35]Uh...
[86:16.92]What's, what's the, uh, not breaking bad, bad, what's it called?
[86:21.84]The Big Bang Theory.
[86:27.30]Math, science, history, it's all of the history.
[86:29.30]It all started, that doesn't make any sense.
[86:31.14]What's the, what am I trying to say to you guys?
[86:32.62]Isn't there a line in the, uh, Big Bang Theory that's like, oh, history, but for it is a mystery or something.
[86:45.47]It's like a song.
[86:50.61]What we have here is history like Ford is a mystery.
[86:53.23]What was it from?
[86:54.21]That's from Kung Fu Panda.
[87:07.72]That's from Karazhan.
[87:14.67]What is it?
[87:16.79]Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery.
[87:19.29]No, no, but there's another one.
[87:24.86]I made it up.
[87:25.36]No, I didn't.
[87:26.76]Yesterday was history.
[87:27.86]Tomorrow is a mystery.
[87:29.08]Yeah, what is it?
[87:29.54]Who said that?
[87:30.38]Is it like Mark Twain?
[87:31.60]Who said that?
[87:32.28]It's Kung Fu Panda.
[87:33.05]Well, okay, from Kung Fu Panda, whatever, the snake says that.
[87:50.34]Ah, another fine day behind us.
[87:57.18]That was a second video- the second Jerm of video title.
[88:00.67]Wait, what?
[88:01.39]Is that where that- his memory is coming from?
[88:04.11]That's a video title.
[88:08.01]And I thought it was the intro to the Big Bang Theory.
[88:16.84]These memories are insane.
[88:18.71]Okay, so wait, that was just a second Jerma title?
[88:22.29]It's from a thumbnail.
[88:29.49]Wait, it's from this one.
[88:33.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:34.96]I need to see.
[88:36.38]This video is called... Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery.
[88:41.86]It all started with a Big Bang.
[89:00.55]oh boy oh boy it's not from kung fu panda what are you talking about it's from a title of one of my videos okay plant a root bug snack in the garden I missed all that because I was like having trouble alright what am I doing day behind us
[89:27.28]Plant a fruit bug snack in the garden.
[89:28.96]Okay, I gotta plant fruits in the garden.
[89:31.40]Where's the garden?
[89:32.78]Quiet.
[89:33.38]Where's the garden?
[89:37.46]Where's the garden?
[89:46.80]Garden?
[89:49.04]Alright, garden.
[89:50.14]Garden Grove.
[89:51.06]Alright, I gotta go to Garden Grove.
[90:01.74]Snackberg, is this Garden Grove coming up here?
[90:03.46]Nope.
[90:08.36]What's this?
[90:09.18]Garden Grove?
[90:10.22]Garden Grove.
[90:18.48]You went right past it.
[90:20.08]Wait, the garden, not this.
[90:21.32]We're going to talk to you anyways.
[90:25.41]Okay.
[90:25.61]Jerm of the fucking Link.
[90:26.79]Jerm of the fucking Link.
[90:27.29]You guys need to calm down before you get me angry.
[90:28.71]Link.
[90:29.03]This is from, uh, Kung Fu Panda.
[90:55.33]You are too concerned with what was and what will be.
[90:58.91]There's a saying.
[91:01.67]Yesterday is history.
[91:04.51]Tomorrow is a mystery.
[91:06.74]But today is a gift.
[91:09.52]That is why it is called the present.
[91:12.88]Oh, I just didn't do the second half.
[91:23.56]I stole that from Kung Fu Panda.
[91:25.80]No, I didn't.
[91:26.88]I remembered it from the Big Bang Theory, but I actually remembered it from the title of one of my videos, but it's truly from Kung Fu Panda.
[91:37.02]You understand?
[91:43.69]Scan six types of Bugsnax in Garden Grove.
[91:47.37]Got it.
[91:49.79]Already got that one.
[91:50.49]Uh, who am I missing?
[91:51.99]What's this?
[91:53.50]Candy patch?
[91:55.44]Cool.
[91:56.46]Apologize.
[91:57.16]Why?
[92:04.62]Some bugs only come out at night.
[92:06.22]So it's kind of like Stardew Valley fishing.
[92:08.61]That's cool.
[92:10.21]I'm gonna do this.
[92:12.01]What about in the cave?
[92:13.19]Already got the fries.
[92:20.55]I already got the burger.
[92:28.61]Oh, and that's you.
[92:29.85]Okay.
[92:31.88]How do I get any other bugs to come out?
[92:38.20]Wait, hold on.
[92:39.72]That's a different one.
[92:41.00]That's a white strappy.
[92:46.22]That's a scare snack.
[92:49.13]Okay, so it scares away the snacks.
[92:51.41]There's a poop pile.
[92:52.85]Buried bug snack.
[92:53.85]These Bugsnax have been planted in the ground like crops.
[92:59.43]Is that a hot dog?
[93:01.28]Oh my god.
[93:02.48]It's a hot dog.
[93:06.12]Need one more.
[93:06.90]But wait, I want to get a hot dog.
[93:13.83]I love him.
[93:15.83]I love him.
[93:18.06]What's wrong with him?
[93:19.66]He loves ketchup.
[93:20.96]Okay.
[93:21.48]You love ketchup so much.
[93:22.46]We'll go over there.
[93:34.79]Get the glissy.
[93:35.91]Glissy.
[93:36.29]What's a glissy?
[93:40.97]What's a glissy?
[93:43.09]Glissy?
[93:45.97]I want this thing though.
[93:51.91]What do you like?
[93:54.23]What are your interests?
[93:59.59]You like chocolate?
[94:00.35]You love chocolate.
[94:01.53]Well, I don't think I even need to get that.
[94:03.90]It's catchy.
[94:06.12]Hey, uh, white strappy.
[94:08.88]Strappy!
[94:10.74]Uh, uh, uh, uh.
[94:12.38]Strappy!
[94:13.86]Uh.
[94:15.40]Where do I go?
[94:16.56]Okay, over here.
[94:17.06]Should I pick up one of the poop guys?
[94:21.59]pickle ankle oh let's dig him up he's dead no I don't want to go to flavor Falls that's killer oh man knocked it out of the park man we're at a joint that's killer
[94:50.07]Hey, you guys know that I've watched a few Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives recently.
[94:54.57]And he's really trying to get his son to take over.
[94:56.57]He don't want to fucking do that anymore.
[94:58.47]He keeps like putting his kind of older son into the camera and stuff.
[95:02.34]It's like, oh, this is my son, Hunter.
[95:05.70]And Hunter's like, oh man, that's delicious.
[95:07.02]Flavortown.
[95:08.10]He's like training his son to take over the business so he can stop doing Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
[95:14.26]It's actually kind of funny.
[95:15.32]It's like very, it's like kind of wholesome in a way.
[95:17.60]Because his son is old enough now where he's kind of getting more comfortable on camera.
[95:21.65]And they both have similar catchphrases.
[95:23.53]You can tell he's kind of doing the catchphrases.
[95:27.53]Oh, man.
[95:28.11]You totally killed it.
[95:29.17]You knocked it out of the park, man.
[95:30.96]Yeah, you knocked it out of the park.
[95:32.04]Right, Hunter?
[95:34.58]And then eventually like he'll, he's gonna, but is he gonna have the hair?
[95:37.63]I really hope that they do a full, a full complete transition from like father to son.
[95:44.01]And he gets the hair and he gets the blonde hair and the blonde goatee.
[95:48.77]That would be unbelievable.
[95:50.17]I would watch every episode.
[95:54.09]There must always be a Lich King.
[95:56.02]Yes, there must always be a Lich King.
[95:59.94]Otherwise the whole society collapses.
[96:06.21]Without a Guy Fieri, the whole thing comes down.
[96:11.31]Oh, I love that.
[96:12.73]Fucking mod that guy for an hour.
[96:17.22]The Flavor King.
[96:25.71]Where is this other bug?
[96:27.87]I don't know where this other bug is.
[96:33.44]Dude, don't put it past him, man.
[96:35.10]World of Warcraft's running out of shit to talk about.
[96:39.59]Do not be surprised if in 10 years, when World of Warcraft is on its 30th expansion, where it's like, well, uh, I guess, like, we went to the place where everybody was dead.
[96:49.84]We went to space.
[96:51.22]We went to, uh, the center of the fucking Earth.
[96:55.38]We went to hell.
[96:56.08]We went to heaven.
[96:56.72]Uh, I guess we're gonna go to Flavortown.
[97:00.36]That's what's left.
[97:02.00]And like Disney.
[97:03.02]Like Disney World.
[97:13.04]Should I dig this up?
[97:14.56]Where's this last?
[97:15.16]There's one more bug.
[97:16.22]Where's this pickle bug?
[97:20.36]Something in there.
[97:22.58]I would play that expansion.
[97:24.34]That would be the only thing that would bring me back to WoW.
[97:28.00]And I'm talking about a fully voice acted.
[97:30.38]But still in kind of like the shitty World of Warcraft engine Guy Fieri.
[97:34.50]And it's just a human model.
[97:36.32]Just the standard human model.
[97:38.14]That they just gave a blonde goatee and spiky blonde hair to.
[97:43.00]That's what they're capable of doing.
[97:55.19]I gotta pee.
[97:55.81]I'll be right back.
[97:56.71]It's pee time.
[102:00.47]You know, I don't understand how it gets so hot in here.
[102:05.25]When I'm sitting in this room, do I just emanate heat?
[102:10.78]Inside of this room, it has to be 10 degrees hotter than the next room out of this door.
[102:18.68]Wow.
[102:21.24]I know, it's cold.
[102:24.70]Alright, let's go.
[102:28.07]World of Warcraft!
[102:29.01]Can you imagine...
[102:31.22]Sorry, where was I?
[102:33.96]I need to get six bugs.
[102:39.04]It's cold in Nevada?
[102:39.92]Oh yeah, it gets really cold in Nevada.
[102:44.26]That's a sweetie fly.
[102:47.74]It eventually sits down to rest.
[102:49.76]Where?
[102:51.61]In the sky.
[102:55.89]Remember, Nevada's the desert.
[102:57.71]So it gets really, really, really hot and really, really, really cold.
[103:05.87]There's really no in-between in Nevada.
[103:09.31]I scanned all the things.
[103:10.13]Click the link, please.
[103:10.85]Here's the... But I don't understand.
[103:12.93]What...
[103:33.38]Why is he not like a dwarf or a human?
[103:36.30]I don't think, I wouldn't consider Guy Fieri to be like a blood elf.
[103:39.72]Would you?
[103:40.62]Hold on, where is this?
[103:43.06]Oh, there we go.
[103:57.01]Yeah, I don't think, I don't see this to be accurate.
[104:01.10]That's Guy Fiery.
[104:03.39]Guy Fireye.
[104:06.99]No, no, that's all wrong!
[104:14.85]This needs to be a dwarf.
[104:16.83]No, but they need to take the dwarf and stretch the dwarf out longer.
[104:20.09]Have it be the only model in the game that has a Gumby body.
[104:23.97]Just stretch out the legs and the torso and give him the goatee and the hair.
[104:33.34]Oh, by the way, see you guys in probably a couple years when Gumby comes back.
[104:39.71]We're going to get new 2021-2022 Gumby.
[104:41.23]They're going to bring it back.
[104:44.23]You know that's up next.
[104:47.36]I'll just stamp this.
[104:49.46]It's definitely coming up next for the things we're bringing back as a group.
[104:53.52]Not me and you, but them.
[104:58.28]Alright, what's your favorite?
[105:08.42]The establishment, yep.
[105:11.33]The establishment.
[105:13.11]The Illuminati.
[105:14.27]Like, the TV Illuminati.
[105:18.29]What do we bring back next?
[105:19.21]Hmm.
[105:20.27]About.
[105:20.53]Hmm.
[105:22.30]Elmo.
[105:22.70]Wait, no, he's already here.
[105:23.78]He's already here permanently.
[105:25.58]Hmm.
[105:26.34]Maybe...
[105:28.87]What was that little bald kid's name?
[105:34.14]Bring him back too!
[105:39.24]Caillou.
[105:44.53]Is it- doesn't everybody hate Caillou?
[105:51.59]I was under the assumption that, like, Caillou was horrible.
[105:54.75]And kids were, like, being naughty and stuff after they watched Caillou.
[105:59.22]Am I making that up?
[106:01.66]Alright, what's your favorite- Okay, feed her favorite bug snack.
[106:04.84]I hope it's hot dogs.
[106:06.05]I didn't pay attention.
[106:11.44]Does it have a hot dog arm?
[106:13.34]Wait, you can sleep?
[106:41.43]Okay, find out what Wampus does between 10 p.m.
[106:44.12]and 1 a.m.
[106:45.10]I don't know if you could sleep.
[106:47.96]Alright, between 10 p.m.
[106:49.46]and 1 a.m.
[106:49.86]We're gonna find out what Wampus is doing.
[106:53.02]Okay, sleep until 5 p.m.
[106:56.28]Do I have a watch?
[107:00.11]Oh, it's down the lower left.
[107:00.91]Okay, between 10 and 1.
[107:02.89]We gotta go find Wampus.
[107:12.56]Zerking off for three hours.
[107:20.90]I love how you guys have found this great way.
[107:23.39]And I'll be honest, me too.
[107:25.11]It's like getting around the sensors.
[107:28.59]I didn't say that.
[107:29.43]I said zerking off.
[107:30.73]It's different.
[107:31.39]Okay.
[107:38.81]Dude, you look like a clown.
[107:40.27]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[107:49.17]Okay, sure.
[107:54.10]Maybe one day you'll fly this.
[107:57.54]Should we tell him?
[107:58.60]Should we tell him that it's not ever gonna happen?
[108:01.32]Alright, I got another thing for you to eat.
[108:03.64]Look, I've got a strawberry and I'm gonna put it on your eye.
[108:07.08]Oh.
[108:12.22]We're only gonna feed this guy and make him, like, the top dog.
[108:16.88]We're gonna make this guy the alpha.
[108:20.23]Ooh, plant!
[108:23.77]Okay.
[108:24.85]Pick a bug snack to plant.
[108:26.63]Oh, shit.
[108:27.99]We shouldn't have... Alright.
[108:31.27]I'll remember where this is.
[108:36.37]But I need to spy on this guy between... Alright, we need to wait till 10 p.m.
[108:43.85]Okay, he loves the green guy.
[108:46.67]What time is it?
[108:51.95]Six.
[108:52.55]Shit, I got here really early.
[108:53.67]Just sleep.
[108:59.47]No, I can't.
[109:04.30]How long would it take for you to read the entire Bible?
[109:09.18]Probably a pretty long time.
[109:11.98]Probably a few... At least a few days.
[109:18.06]I can't... I have trouble... I can't read the Bible.
[109:19.90]It's just... The way that it's worded and the way that it's spread out and the paragraphing and... I can't follow it.
[109:25.84]It just feels like somebody's just speaking at me while I have my ears covered.
[109:29.67]You know what I mean?
[109:30.09]It's like I'm kind of hearing what you're saying, but I don't get it.
[109:32.27]I can't comprehend it.
[109:40.65]I'm...
[109:43.51]Read a kid's Bible.
[109:47.27]Not of that.
[109:50.23]Kids edition.
[109:58.90]Kids edition.
[110:00.94]Read the Bible of manga.
[110:08.24]Bible picture book.

[110:13.99]I thought you were here.
[110:21.35]Alright, it's 8pm.
[110:23.87]I'm gonna follow this guy.
[110:29.89]Read the Minecraft Bible.
[110:31.31]Is this a Minecraft Bible?
[110:40.61]Lego Bible.
[110:44.42]Who's that?
[110:51.01]Fortnite Bible.
[110:51.75]Holy shit, I saw the Lego Bible at Costco one time.
[111:00.60]You made that up.
[111:01.42]That's the best part about the internet.
[111:03.80]You can just write anything and just say it's real.
[111:14.31]830.
[111:21.17]It's not real.
[111:21.95]It's not real.
[111:22.43]There's no Lego Bible.
[111:25.41]It wouldn't surprise me, though, because there's Lego everything.
[111:34.85]Brick Testament.
[111:37.03]Yeah, but I think that... Shh, quiet.
[111:55.54]What you doing?
[112:10.85]It's 9.30 It's too early.

[112:30.77]I'm not going to look at him anymore.
[112:31.95]I'm not going to look at him anymore.
[112:34.07]I'm not going to look at him anymore through the window until 10.
[112:36.32]Okay, it's 10.
[112:36.90]What does it do?
[112:38.38]I can't look through this window from this perspective.
[112:40.80]I can't.
[112:42.08]I just can't do it.
[112:43.48]What is he doing?
[112:51.18]What are you doing?
[112:52.62]What is he doing?
[112:53.92]Yeah, farming didn't go so well today.

[115:46.00]No, that's not a tomato.
[115:47.42]Tomato is part of it.
[115:51.82]No, pizza's not a vegetable because there's tomato on it.

[116:56.86]Who are you, though?
[116:57.80]Uh, Gramble Giggle Funny.

[117:05.54]You have a family?
[117:06.54]I did, but then they... Can we talk about something else?
[117:14.65]Well, they're just the cutest little things, aren't they?
[117:17.97]I don't understand how anybody could look into their googly little eyes and want to eat them.
[117:24.63]But everybody does eat them, though.
[117:28.03]Well, they don't eat none of mine, and that's what counts.
[117:32.38]Why did you leave?
[117:33.62]Without Liz to bring in snacks, everybody got mighty hungry.
[117:37.84]They'd untreated my barn like a grocery store.
[117:41.31]Held him off.
[117:41.95]Ow.
[117:42.07]Everyone's family is dead.
[117:43.93]You came here post-apocalypse.
[117:44.93]The siege of the barn.
[118:08.65]Alright, what about Lizbert?
[118:11.13]Where did she go?
[118:11.65]Oh.
[118:34.97]I like to think they're all like Sprout, helping out like little sidekicks.
[118:39.67]But sometimes she didn't get enough on the hunt.
[118:42.95]She always liked to bring something back for Agabelle.
[118:46.81]Can we talk about bug tax?
[118:48.32]Alright.
[118:50.06]But what happened to Lizbert?
[118:51.14]Sometimes I wake up at night and I'm out of bed, lost in the woods.
[118:56.66]I think I see Lizbert out there watching me like a vengeful spirit.
[119:01.79]Did you sleepwalk kill Lizbert?
[119:06.43]You're getting really defensive when we bring up Lizbert.
[119:10.47]You don't eat Bugsnax.
[119:12.15]But that doesn't mean you don't eat puppet humans.
[119:16.23]Oh, a key.

[131:45.49]Go, go, go, go.
[131:52.11]Obama.
[131:54.09]I think that we all need to come together to take care of this.

[132:00.40]Don't worry about that.
[132:01.40]Go, go.

[132:12.03]Squidward.

[132:52.18]Meatwad.
[132:52.76]Okay.
[132:53.34]Shake.
[132:54.58]I don't want to know.
[132:55.24]I just got away from it, Shake.
[132:56.44]We don't have to plant it.
[132:57.88]Homer.
[132:58.36]Hey, it's me, Homer.

[133:24.49]The planet is under attack.
[133:29.31]Kirby.
[133:34.87]Trump.
[133:36.43]Okay.
[133:37.29]This, I tell you, I didn't do anything wrong.
[133:39.95]It's the fake media.
[133:42.83]Megamind.
[133:47.74]I don't know.
[133:48.38]Will Ferrell's normal voice.
[133:57.43]Dana White?
[133:58.65]Like from UFC?
[134:02.24]We've got... It's the tail of the tape.
[134:04.60]We've got these two fighters.
[134:05.72]Why do you want me to do a Dana White impression?
[134:08.98]I don't get it.
[134:09.34]That doesn't make any sense.
[134:10.06]It's just a normal guy talking.
[134:17.95]Watch out, man.
[134:18.49]Got it.
[134:18.73]I just want to... Hold on.
[134:22.81]I'll get it.
[134:26.19]The thing we're talking about means you.
[134:28.83]I just want to say the cream of the crop.
[134:32.70]Next.
[134:33.58]Dr. Evil.
[134:34.52]Oh, a binky on my face.
[134:39.16]Alex Jones.
[134:40.08]Mr. Krabs.
[134:40.52]Kanye.
[134:40.94]Hey.
[134:41.08]Alright, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.
[134:43.53]Hey.
[134:43.65]Howdy.
[135:01.28]Joe Rogan.
[135:03.70]Yeah.
[135:05.95]Yeah.
[135:07.87]Right, man.
[135:10.19]Yeah.
[135:11.33]Come on.
[135:13.41]Eric Hartman.
[135:14.59]Ah, my name's Eric Hartman.
[135:16.03]I talk like this.
[135:17.01]And hey, I'm Kenny.
[135:18.77]I'm not Kenny.
[135:21.26]Wompus.
[135:24.58]I only came here for a trip.
[135:27.00]Sometimes I wonder if she'd do the same for me.
[135:35.74]Popeye.
[135:38.78]Well, I am a sailor man.
[135:41.88]I'm Papa the Sailor Man.
[135:45.28]The medic.
[135:46.18]Oh, that was not medicine.
[135:48.70]Okay, people are going to leave.
[135:49.50]I have to stop.
[135:50.04]Let's play the game.
[135:59.21]This dude's going off.
[136:03.74]You're dropping viewers.
[136:05.64]Hey, we'll see you next week when they decide to come back after their... The ultimate small doses streamer.
[136:14.16]Yeah, I peek in from time to time.
[136:16.06]Yeah, in small doses I can handle them.
[136:22.13]Alright, well I gotta go find things to plant here.
[136:28.87]Ooh, Mr. Satan.
[136:29.89]You guys already know my Mr. Satan.
[136:31.27]I don't have to do it again.
[136:32.33]Of course I do.
[136:34.32]Send him to hell?
[136:35.36]Send who to hell?
[136:58.46]I am not even playing the game.
[137:00.82]I'm just stuck in the mirror.
[137:03.20]This is what I do in the mirror.
[137:04.64]I already get stuck like this two or three times a day.
[137:09.26]You put me in front of a mirror, I'm going to see myself and go, which person?
[137:11.44]Who's that?
[137:11.71]Oh, that's me.
[137:14.89]Don't put me in front of a mirror.
[137:15.79]I get trapped.
[137:25.87]What do I do?
[137:35.22]I need vegetables!
[137:40.38]Donate- Wait, wait, wait!
[137:41.24]I can just get bugs!
[137:41.94]Let's get bugs, you ready?
[137:43.55]Alright, check this out.
[137:45.31]Gonna have you... Hey!
[137:51.63]Don't do that shit.
[138:04.31]I get to donate six bugs to the ranch.
[138:06.07]I'll just get them from here.
[138:08.31]But I have to... Do I not have a tool that I can go in the air with?
[138:12.26]I feel like it's been a while.
[138:14.44]Alright, let's get this bug.
[138:17.08]Catch-up bug.
[138:19.14]I'll put that down there.
[138:20.08]Get some catch-up, please.
[138:22.30]Thank you.
[138:22.72]Let's get him.
[138:28.95]Do G-Men and I'll... Wait.
[138:30.27]Do G-Men and I'll give 100,000 subs.
[138:31.69]Uh, Mr. Freeman.
[138:36.31]That's not right.
[138:37.21]That's the scientist.
[138:37.79]Let me do it again.
[138:39.43]I know the thing about that, Gordon.
[138:42.51]You abandoned the wrong place at the right time.
[138:47.22]Could make all the difference.
[138:51.18]Open the briefcase, Gordon.
[138:52.70]100,000 subs?
[138:54.66]Thank you.
[139:06.65]You know, this is just what I think would happen when, like, the really, really hyperactive kid in Show and Tell didn't bring anything for Show and Tell, and the teacher just knows he's fucking out of his mind.
[139:18.74]So they just go, you know what?
[139:20.04]Okay, go ahead.
[139:21.60]And I brought my impressions today.
[139:24.84]And everyone just has to put up with this for the five to ten minutes that happens.
[139:34.08]What do you like?
[139:35.32]Maybe I can lure you over with some candy.
[139:38.14]Right?
[139:38.34]Because it's a candy fly, and there's candy here.
[139:41.78]Does the candy fly like candy?
[139:48.80]That would make sense, right?
[139:52.80]What do you like, though?
[139:54.59]Don't be a sucker.
[139:55.41]What do you like?
[139:55.87]You don't have any likes or dislikes.
[140:00.45]Come on.
[140:03.93]A fail of 6 tanks with 5 community subs.
[140:05.93]A little short of 100,000, but, you know, we make bets here that we don't go through with.
[140:11.09]Like me, like you.
[140:13.67]I need two hamburgers to fight each other.
[140:14.91]If I can do that.
[140:17.03]Alright, come here.
[140:19.04]Hamburger.
[140:20.88]You.
[140:22.26]Follow.
[140:27.84]Oh.
[140:31.00]Alright, come on.
[140:31.82]Come on, Bunger.
[140:33.64]Bunger!
[140:35.20]Nice!
[140:35.54]Sick!
[140:35.84]Nice!
[140:36.12]Sick!
[140:36.30]Sick!
[140:36.44]Sick!
[140:36.58]Nice!
[140:36.82]Sick!
[140:37.34]Any more Bungers?
[140:45.39]You owe us the dump truck emote.
[140:50.87]No, I don't.
[140:52.11]Maybe eventually you'll get it if you behave.
[140:58.65]Well, I have four.
[140:59.34]Let me just go back and donate these.
[141:08.10]You told us three new emotes.
[141:10.74]Yeah, like within the next seven to ten days, it's been like five.
[141:14.92]I got plenty of time.
[141:29.97]Queenie worm.
[141:31.61]Oh, wait, here's a fruit.
[141:34.18]Get back there.
[141:34.60]Because then I can plant the fruit, and then I need a... I need a carrot.
[141:39.76]Can I actually plant the french fries?
[141:41.26]Does that not work?
[141:45.45]Four-part dump truck ass emote.
[141:50.79]I'm gonna get kicked off of Twitch.
[141:57.55]Baku Tail thanks for the five... No, it's six community subs, actually.
[142:00.35]I read that wrong.
[142:06.36]I don't think I've even been to Flavor Falls.
[142:10.48]Got that.
[142:10.92]Yeah, that's a good olive.
[142:15.31]Holy shit.
[142:16.15]What the hell is that?
[142:17.41]It's a sub sandwich?
[142:22.79]That's my favorite.
[142:23.75]I love them.
[142:25.53]How do I get a sandwich bug thing?
[142:29.08]How do I get the Super Bowl party sandwich?
[142:33.50]What is that?
[142:35.26]A veggie bit.
[142:38.31]No, you.
[142:39.33]A white rootle.
[142:40.41]Oh, shit.
[142:40.96]Alright, hold on.
[142:42.72]I have to release some of these.
[142:43.70]Okay, I have too many french fries.
[142:47.96]Release.
[142:48.24]Hey.
[142:53.47]Release you.
[142:56.79]Go to the farm.
[142:57.45]Yeah, I want to catch this one.
[142:59.95]Because that's a veggie.
[143:07.55]This game is really cute.
[143:08.57]Alright, there's my vegetable.
[143:14.80]There's my... Loves.
[143:20.68]Speeds along crashing into things.
[143:21.90]It won't slow down until it's broken up.
[143:23.68]What is it?
[143:27.19]Love?
[143:27.45]Orange juice?
[143:33.39]I'll come back for you.
[143:34.03]Is that a pretzel?
[143:39.47]What is this?
[143:40.45]Tasty Twisty Snack Pod?
[143:43.03]What?
[143:43.25]Alright, get rid of the french fries.
[143:47.77]Another 10 community subs.
[143:51.77]It's just a bag of chips, but it's alive.
[143:55.86]What?
[143:58.52]Uh, Flutter.
[144:00.50]Looter, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[144:03.48]Alright, I gotta deliver these.
[144:05.06]I missed other subs, did I?
[144:11.81]Oh, shit, we had a lot.
[144:12.57]Yeah, we did, right.
[144:13.47]Fel6 gave 5.
[144:17.57]JubelubeTube gave 5.
[144:20.47]And then CaptainNemo gave 100 bucks.
[144:23.79]Thanks for the 10,000 bits.
[144:25.51]It's huge money today.
[144:27.05]There's been like 3 or 4 of these.
[144:29.35]Too much money.
[144:32.01]And CaptainNemo says, dump truck emote tomorrow or I will freeze this card before it goes through.
[144:37.51]Uh, well, I don't...
[144:40.93]Well, you're gonna be hearing from your bank.
[144:43.15]I don't think he's gonna be here tomorrow.
[144:56.94]I'm gonna freeze my cart.
[145:00.24]Yes, this is bank.
[145:02.10]How can I help you?
[145:04.38]I'd like to freeze my credit card.
[145:06.12]I'd like to report a freeze to the purchase that just happened.
[145:09.16]And what purchase would that be?
[145:11.12]A hundred dollars to an e-clown.
[145:13.48]Oh, you didn't make that purchase?
[145:16.06]No.
[145:17.70]You didn't because you confirmed it twice.
[145:19.99]No, um... I did, but... He said he wasn't going to make a Jerma-ass dump truck emote, so... I have to refund it.
[145:31.49]Okay.
[145:32.59]Um... No.
[145:33.41]No.
[145:35.59]I'm switching banks.
[145:36.81]I'm switching banks.
[145:37.81]This is bullshit.
[145:38.43]I'm switching banks.
[145:40.83]Everything good?
[145:49.15]Cool.
[145:52.26]I planted the snacks.
[145:53.08]Thank you kindly.
[145:54.22]I'll get those Bugsnax growing.
[145:56.42]You'll see.
[145:59.48]He's destroying.
[146:00.52]No, I'm not.
[146:03.41]Wait, I have some more stuff.
[146:04.69]Alright, you eat.
[146:05.53]What about this pretzel snack pod?
[146:12.81]I did this stuff in the lunchroom in like the fourth grade.
[146:16.11]Put the pretzel sticks in your mouth and you go.
[146:17.52]Alright, what about burger?
[146:23.46]Nice.
[146:28.76]Donate.
[146:29.28]Oh, right.
[146:29.66]You're right, right, right, right, right.
[146:35.05]Donate you.
[146:36.25]Donate Dr. Soda.
[146:38.89]Oh, look!
[146:39.75]They actually come out and play!
[146:45.21]I love this guy.
[146:49.22]Is it weird that this part of my brain sees this as some weird, post-apocalyptic, polluted Earth shit?
[147:04.04]This is gonna be real.
[147:11.02]I don't like looking at that one anymore.
[147:12.36]Alright, I need four more snacks.
[147:16.84]Hey, don't annoy me.
[147:17.86]And we're voting you off the island.
[147:19.90]I don't want to have any personal issues.
[147:21.44]Personal issues.
[147:22.82]Aren't I doing that already?
[147:50.20]I was going to just try to do a Milhouse from Simpsons voice, but that would be way too hard.
[147:55.60]Following me?
[148:07.14]I still got to get some more.
[148:09.32]You have something that's... Wait, interview.
[148:11.56]Bilbo gave you... No, he didn't.
[148:20.21]That's the fucking bugs.
[148:21.23]Holy shit.
[148:22.10]I don't know you could even... Hold on.
[148:23.80]What do you do professionally, though?
[148:25.36]Is he a spy?
[148:46.51]Is that fun fact unrelated?
[148:48.19]I'm just saying, if you got in trouble, like a lot of trouble and all your friends turned against you, this would be a great place to hide out forever.
[148:56.71]Oh.
[148:58.21]Oh shit, I ain't even recording.
[149:02.60]Oh well, she won't even fucking notice.
[149:05.44]They're so cute, I could literally eat them up.
[149:08.18]And I do!
[149:13.75]Ugh, there's drama and then there's drama.
[149:17.07]Drama?
[149:17.71]Oh, my God.
[149:18.69]Feed me.
[149:19.15]And I'm done getting caught up in social dumpster fires.
[149:21.58]Ah, hey.
[149:25.46]My cave was sweet.
[149:27.20]Plus, it was close enough to Wambus that I could swipe some sauce when I needed to.
[149:31.91]So, you're an international criminal and you steal from the farmer.
[149:38.90]That's, uh, grade A awful.
[149:39.44]Where's the Lizbert?
[149:40.07]Tell me.
[149:40.27]Uh...
[150:03.74]You wanna go to jail?
[150:04.54]What is it?
[150:05.98]Hamburger Bugsnax.
[150:22.45]That's everybody's weakness though.
[150:24.51]I don't buy that.
[150:24.97]Uh oh.
[150:44.39]Eggabelle, suspicious.
[150:46.95]Eggabelle.
[150:48.39]You could shorten that a little.
[150:50.77]Say something about how suspicious Eggabelle is.
[150:54.15]Hmm.
[150:54.29]Oh, I have a key.
[150:56.62]I have two keys.
[150:57.90]Alright, so I have two.
[150:59.98]Let me go open.
[151:01.74]Let me try to open that door.
[151:17.03]Walking my way out.
[151:19.41]Fine, I'll just barrel through.
[151:23.07]Alright, where's this little cabin somewhere?
[151:30.16]Wait, what's this way?
[151:30.78]This is like a desert.
[151:33.56]Ooh.
[151:33.92]We're gonna get some desert bugs?
[151:42.42]Wrong way?
[151:42.86]Yeah, I haven't seen anything over here.
[151:44.46]Scorched Gorge.
[151:54.45]Oh, it's a chili pepper.
[151:55.71]A scorpeno.
[152:00.66]The snack lobs fiery peppers at anything that catches its attention.
[152:08.74]I like that one.
[152:09.26]Wait, what's that thing?
[152:10.54]Weird.
[152:12.73]A pop tick.
[152:13.47]They are too small to catch in a trap, but maybe some heat will puff them up.
[152:17.99]Alright, hold on.
[152:18.49]What about you?
[152:19.61]What does the Scorpaniel like?
[152:22.13]Loves?
[152:23.75]What's the orange thing?
[152:27.77]So I can have them kind of pop the popcorns.
[152:29.55]It's mustard?
[152:32.21]Where do you get mustard?
[152:38.20]Settle down.
[152:41.49]What is that?
[152:42.41]A spuddy.
[152:43.25]It protects its territory by charging intruders with its powerful jaws.
[152:47.25]It loves ketchup.
[152:48.21]Okay.
[152:49.81]Let's catch this motherfucker.
[152:56.48]Is it too big?
[153:00.14]Got a good link.
[153:00.72]Hold on.
[153:03.28]It's too big.
[153:03.82]Too big.
[153:08.10]Uh... He just smashed into the wall.
[153:15.98]Do that again.
[153:16.36]Do that again.
[153:23.14]Whoa, whoa!
[153:23.66]We just got- There's a secret in here!
[153:26.57]What the hell is this?
[153:27.19]Whoa.
[153:44.65]That's the pizza demon that we saw earlier.
[153:46.15]It's lore.
[153:51.51]Secret lore.
[153:52.03]Okay.
[153:56.62]Oh, you got a quest over here.
[153:57.52]Wait.
[154:00.56]Oh my god.
[154:01.10]It's like a rib.
[154:04.74]Ribble... Ribble peed.
[154:11.03]It likes to hide and sit still.
[154:12.43]Maybe some sauce could get it to move.
[154:15.54]Like barbecue sauce?
[154:17.88]Will you fucking leave me alone?
[154:18.94]You like ketchup?
[154:33.27]Oh, I covered him in ketchup and he hated it.
[154:35.03]Okay, wait.
[154:40.52]Got him.
[154:42.49]I got a Rivelpede.
[154:43.53]Alright, how do I stop you from doing this?
[154:46.51]What am I supposed to do with you?
[154:51.38]He's covered in ketchup.
[154:56.66]Does it make him mad?
[154:57.32]Wait, there's a butterfly up there.
[155:02.59]Hold on.
[155:02.81]And there's a quest.
[155:06.84]Oh, it's Triffidy.
[155:07.48]Everyone talks shit about you.
[155:08.40]Get the bug.
[155:09.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[155:10.84]Hold on.
[155:11.34]Hold on.
[155:11.64]Somebody got a link.
[155:13.86]That's a good one.
[155:14.50]This one's not bad.
[155:42.72]Not bad.
[155:43.08]It's pretty good.
[155:47.46]I don't know if I love chocolate, though.
[155:48.92]I like chocolate.
[155:50.90]I don't know if I love chocolate.
[156:07.19]Hmm.
[156:07.27]Ooh, I got one of those.
[156:08.39]Ooh, how many do you want?
[156:10.67]Three?
[156:10.83]I can do that.
[156:11.71]Let's go.
[156:11.97]Isn't it safe?
[156:12.53]I wanted to get people to come back to town.
[156:14.81]Alright, Ribblepedes.
[156:16.17]There's one right there.
[156:16.81]What's your trajectory?
[156:36.09]Alright, that's the trajectory.
[156:37.11]Get that shit down, let's go.
[156:41.45]Toss him up.
[156:43.73]Where'd you go?
[156:51.38]Oh wait, you went all the way around.
[156:53.08]Really strange path you have.
[156:58.46]Alright, one more.
[157:02.25]I like the voice.
[157:04.48]I can't wait for the one that's like, Rebel Pede!
[157:10.54]That will be my favorite.
[157:11.38]Okay, every goblin from Warcraft and Hearthstone.
[157:18.02]Where do you want me to go?
[157:31.79]Who is this talking?
[157:32.55]Oh, it's you.
[157:37.20]Wait.
[157:45.28]A white cheepoof.
[157:47.50]It's a cheese puff.
[157:50.55]You're annoying.
[157:51.01]Stop doing that.
[157:54.65]Annie DeVito.
[157:55.33]That'd be great.
[157:57.86]Wait, my ball.
[157:59.43]Oh, man.
[158:00.19]I left the ball all the way back there.
[158:02.23]I'm a bad father.
[158:04.13]Come on, I'm back.
[158:04.73]Wait, he loves this.
[158:07.57]He loves that.
[158:10.31]What do I do with that information?
[158:16.54]Hmm, what does it say?
[158:19.16]Some assembly required.
[158:20.06]Buy at your own risk.
[158:20.90]All sales are final.
[158:23.97]Offer void where prohibited.
[158:25.53]Shirt and shoes optional.
[158:26.63]May contain nuts or shellfish.
[158:27.75]Guarantees not guaranteed.
[158:29.45]Bridge for sale.
[158:30.09]Can you make it up there?
[158:35.20]Gotcha.
[158:36.86]Thought he was covered in blood for a second.
[158:38.36]Oh, what a journey you are on.
[158:41.38]Get away from me.
[158:44.62]Actually, you know what?
[158:45.32]Come over here.
[158:47.34]Get over here and come light me up.
[158:52.48]Do that over here.
[158:54.45]Okay, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[158:58.71]Pop over here.
[159:01.43]Pop over here.
[159:02.03]Oh, it's a popcorn.
[159:03.49]Go, go, go.
[159:04.05]Over here.
[159:04.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[159:05.41]Wait.
[159:05.73]Okay.
[159:06.17]That's awesome.
[159:06.81]It's a live popcorn.
[159:08.23]I love it.
[159:09.75]Give me this back.
[159:18.28]Yes.
[159:20.00]A pop tick.
[159:23.44]Nice.
[159:27.10]Alright, hold on.
[159:27.44]I gotta pee again.
[159:28.25]This is like a piss day for some reason.
[159:31.58]I'll be right back.
[162:39.02]Who's ready to snack?
[162:46.00]Okay.
[162:48.20]Oh, did I not even put it on the VRB screen?
[162:49.74]I just walked away.
[162:50.80]Shit.
[162:53.24]I thought I did.
[162:53.88]I didn't even switch it.
[162:56.28]Whoops.
[162:59.14]Alright, we need one more Ribble Peed.
[163:03.24]I got the popcorn one, so that's good.
[163:04.60]I'm happy about that.
[163:07.38]They're in the ruins.
[163:09.38]Ancient ruins.
[163:14.03]We got the one in here.
[163:15.89]What about the one over here?
[163:17.63]Is there more than one in here?
[163:19.13]Yep.
[163:23.87]Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[163:24.95]What was the name of that game that everybody told me to play?
[163:28.27]That was the photography game.
[163:30.83]Have we played that game, Africa?
[163:33.39]I completely forgot the name of the game.
[163:38.26]No, no, no.
[163:38.74]It's a... It's like, oh, he loves taking pictures.
[163:43.86]It's a picture of a take photos game.
[163:46.32]No, not Dragon Rampa.
[163:47.34]Something else.
[163:50.23]It's like... No, not Pokémon Snap.
[163:53.95]No, no, no, no.
[163:58.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[163:59.63]Not horror.
[164:00.21]It's like a... The color scheme is like this.
[164:03.39]It looks like this.
[164:03.95]The color scheme is like pink, teal, and electrified.
[164:07.17]And it has a
[164:10.26]Urugami Generation.
[164:11.56]That's the one, right?
[164:12.28]That's it.
[164:15.60]Urugami Generation.
[164:17.76]Alright, is that game any good?
[164:21.36]Did I play that game?
[164:22.70]People kept telling me it was a photo game.
[164:30.97]You have to play Dragon Rampo.
[164:32.85]I probably won't.
[164:34.43]Alright, let's go back and deliver.
[164:42.02]Uh, wait, do you want to eat these?
[164:45.81]You want to eat these?
[164:47.17]I thought you wanted to study them.
[164:55.06]This just looks like you got your arms and legs cut off.
[165:03.57]It's lost all your skin.
[165:05.67]I already opened it.
[165:06.17]Go in, I opened it accidentally.
[165:30.94]I'd like Mr. Magood into the ruins, so go ahead.
[165:35.08]Fuck you gonna do about it?
[165:44.30]Oh, look at me, I can charge!
[165:48.28]Look at me, I'm so fast!
[165:50.08]Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[165:59.08]Get out.
[166:00.46]These murals are still preserved.
[166:03.18]As far as I knew, we were the first Grumps to settle this island.
[166:07.50]But here we got a thousand years of history unaccounted for.
[166:10.16]There were a thousand Grumps before us.
[166:12.42]Generations of Grumpuses who hunted and ate Bugsnax.
[166:16.28]Just a cosmic reminder that nothing really lasts, eh?
[166:18.92]Hmm, what's this?
[166:21.50]Looks like there's a hidden chamber somewhere in the canyon.
[166:24.98]Could that be where they stored Bugsnax?
[166:28.63]Find that chamber.
[166:30.92]Hidden chamber.
[166:32.34]Find and enter the hidden ruins.
[166:36.74]How am I supposed to do that?
[166:38.22]That's not a whole lot of info.
[166:45.32]Opening a section of wall near the river.
[166:47.91]They're carrying a parcel.
[166:49.05]Section of wall near the river.
[166:50.37]Okay, let's go find it.
[166:59.58]I'm the river.
[167:04.22]Scan the moth painting.
[167:07.21]Oh, I'm so I'm so Bobby.
[167:09.95]I'm so sorry.
[167:10.79]I already did.
[167:26.29]Donate the popcorn?
[167:27.17]I will once I find the hidden ruins and do this for Green Grover.
[167:32.44]Alright, hidden.
[167:32.90]Here's the river.
[167:33.66]Is the arrow pointing me to with him?
[167:36.78]No.
[167:37.90]Alright, there's a section of this wall somewhere over here.
[167:40.56]It needs to be... It's probably right there.
[167:44.87]You.
[167:45.71]I need you to run at me really fast.
[167:54.23]Come over here.
[167:57.15]Hey, don't you like sauce?
[167:58.75]I got lots of sauce.
[167:59.59]I got lots of red sauce inside of my body.
[168:08.05]Is it wrong?
[168:09.22]Wait, let me just double check.
[168:13.16]No.
[168:14.76]Near the ri- Ah!
[168:16.60]I found it.
[168:17.44]Right here.
[168:23.54]Look at me.
[168:24.38]I'm covered in sauce.
[168:32.29]I can't get the door open now.
[168:45.85]Hold on.
[168:46.65]I'll get another one.
[168:47.74]There's one back here, right?
[168:55.92]Just cover the ball in sauce and it'll follow me around.
[169:00.45]There you go.
[169:00.99]Okay, cover this ball in sauce.
[169:08.13]Follow me.
[169:14.29]Wait, there's another popcorn.
[169:15.37]Am I gonna die?
[169:20.50]You shithead.
[169:25.30]I'm over here.
[169:26.42]No!
[169:28.54]Whatever.
[169:28.82]I don't need another popcorn.
[169:29.62]I don't care.
[169:30.00]Give me this back.
[169:31.40]Where'd he go?
[169:36.41]Where is he?
[169:37.67]Where is he?
[169:40.79]Where'd he go?
[169:43.29]I'm crying, Jerma.
[169:44.37]I'm sorry that you're crying.
[169:45.35]What happened?
[169:47.15]Where did that guy go?
[169:52.53]Where did he go?
[170:00.72]Am I insane?
[170:01.36]Where did he go?
[170:04.30]Oh, you went all the way down here.
[170:05.52]Perfect.
[170:05.82]Okay.
[170:11.32]Keep going.
[170:11.66]Come on.
[170:16.20]No, no, no, no, no.
[170:16.98]Follow me.
[170:17.40]No, no, no, no.
[170:21.39]Please.
[170:34.69]Break it.
[170:35.91]Yeah.
[170:37.57]Now get out of here.
[170:40.33]What is that?
[170:41.45]Extra dogs?
[170:42.37]What are those?
[170:43.63]Now you're in here with me and I don't want you in here with me.
[170:48.92]Catch one weenie worm.
[170:53.48]What do you like?
[170:54.72]Oh, you're very dirty.
[170:58.10]It's only motivated by its hatred of ketchup.
[171:01.45]Okay, well you don't like ketchup, then I'm sorry, but... Why don't you get away from that?
[171:05.81]Oh, you don't like ketchup!
[171:09.90]Oh, shit!
[171:11.24]Wait a minute, I just covered him with... Why did he just get big and red?
[171:16.08]He got big and red.
[171:31.17]Holy shit!
[171:31.77]Okay, I got him.
[171:33.81]Okay, catch one weenie worm.
[171:35.63]Feed... Oh.
[171:36.97]Feed what?
[171:55.05]Let me look at my book.
[172:00.08]What's with you?
[172:02.61]We need worm.
[172:07.05]Loves mustard, hates ketchup.
[172:11.05]It's only motivated by its hated hatred of ketchup.
[172:13.54]What does it eat?
[172:19.74]Eat it to her.
[172:20.48]Oh.
[172:23.90]Right.
[172:24.90]Okay.
[172:25.06]Okay.
[172:36.61]I think I want another Steakums.
[172:39.12]I want to give somebody a Steakums and have it be like their Steakums brain.
[172:42.46]Give it them their head.
[172:44.52]It's your trajectory.
[172:46.88]Right here.
[172:47.78]Look at that.
[172:49.32]Okay.
[172:49.72]Get ready.
[172:51.29]And shoot you.
[172:52.63]And I'll take one, please.
[172:54.49]Now we have full inventory.
[172:55.61]Let's go.
[172:56.51]Oh, wait.
[172:59.83]There's this weird guy up here.
[173:00.83]It's his problem.
[173:06.56]It's anger from inside out.
[173:11.52]Let's eat.
[173:11.76]Okay, what do you like to eat?
[173:31.05]And have I got a bridge to sell you.
[173:33.93]Beautiful, isn't it?
[173:35.25]Is that weenie doggum?
[173:37.17]New construction, eh?
[173:39.35]Oh, baby, what a bridge.
[173:42.27]All yours for just 100 bucksnacks.
[173:45.53]What do you say?
[173:47.21]I can't even carry that much.
[173:48.99]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[173:51.08]Can't afford it?
[173:51.90]No problem.
[173:53.22]I got a specialty item just for you.
[173:55.66]Cheap is free.
[173:56.86]Follow me, pal.
[174:00.79]I don't think I want to follow you.
[174:02.07]There's a bounce pad?
[174:03.13]Yeah.
[174:03.27]Will you go back to town?
[174:05.11]Switch to it with Q. Wait.
[174:06.43]Aim.
[174:35.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[174:36.91]What?
[174:39.35]Why was that not ready?
[174:52.74]God damn it.
[174:53.22]Wait, I'll be back.
[174:53.86]I feel like I'm playing 007, Goldeneye.
[174:59.58]Isn't there a watch that you can laser people?
[175:10.20]Alright, aim.
[175:13.25]Launch.
[175:15.17]You understand what the fuck just happened?
[175:17.97]Why is it changing?
[175:19.23]I'm aiming and then I'm just, I'm launching.
[175:26.80]Too heavy.
[175:27.32]Okay.
[175:29.92]Aim.
[175:33.76]What?
[175:37.24]Why can I not do this?
[175:50.93]No, you don't.
[175:53.79]Pick this up.
[176:12.87]Bingo.
[176:25.02]And one more.
[176:26.18]I thought it wanted me to launch myself at it.
[176:29.38]Sorry, I don't have one of those fancy science degrees.
[176:33.76]I just hurt my throat doing that.
[176:35.02]I don't know why.
[176:36.42]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[176:37.60]Oh, feel that hot, sweaty breeze.
[176:40.95]Now it's time to pay up.
[176:42.47]What?
[176:42.87]You used it.
[176:43.51]You bought it.
[176:44.43]There's no such thing as a free lunch.
[176:47.42]Cheepoofs?
[176:48.44]So I have to catch the cheepoofs?
[176:49.40]Five, four, three, two, one.
[176:50.04]Oh, what happened?
[176:51.10]Buddy.
[177:14.37]Oh, okay.
[177:15.27]Um, I can't do this yet.
[177:16.17]I have to deliver this stuff.
[177:22.03]I'll come back into this later.
[177:22.93]Yeah, I got priorities.
[177:29.75]Where is she?
[177:32.31]Digging over here.
[177:39.60]His eyes may as well be closed.
[177:40.72]He has no idea what he's doing.
[177:41.78]What are you talking about?
[177:44.60]I have a weenie dog right here.
[177:45.96]The taste is a little off.
[177:58.14]I'm wondering how long those snacks were in there.
[178:01.30]Did you find anything else in the chamber?
[178:04.52]I found a lot of corpses.
[178:06.62]You will, eventually.
[178:27.81]if wambus wants me back well he can come out here and tell me himself you might have heard things haven't been too good between us I keep telling myself I'll get around to cnm but it's just easier to uh stay out here with the bone weird lady weird lady weird lady weird lady weird lady weird lady I suppose I could try being among the living for a while
[178:57.50]What?
[178:58.54]She's going back.
[178:59.08]I did it.
[178:59.48]I win.
[179:03.11]I did it.
[179:03.49]I thought she said she wasn't going to be going back to Snackburg.
[179:20.40]Your mind changed immediately.
[179:22.52]Alright, I gotta donate these.
[179:32.01]You told her about the cactus wife.
[179:33.41]I did?
[179:33.65]I did good.
[179:39.33]She would be goaded among us, unlike you.
[179:41.51]Is that supposed to be an insult?
[179:45.79]That doesn't insult me.
[179:47.83]I don't care.
[179:48.48]Yep.
[179:56.99]If I played Among Us and I got an imposter I would just immediately just start killing everybody at the spawn while cackling like Until I was removed from the lobby and then I would end my stream And then I would write on Twitter
[180:21.13]I'm kind of pissed off that people don't want to play with me and it's annoying.
[180:24.49]Like, what the fuck?
[180:25.59]What did I do?
[180:26.55]That doesn't mean we're not together.
[180:30.64]That's bullshit.
[180:32.28]Why?
[180:32.64]Why'd they kick me out?
[180:33.30]I would just start a ton of problems.
[180:35.96]Maybe even lend a helping paw?
[180:38.21]Teenage girl.
[180:38.87]Oh look, we did good!
[180:40.41]Time for the interview!
[180:41.41]He's been fucking a cactus?
[180:44.17]Ow.
[181:07.15]Alright, who are you?
[181:07.89]What was your name?
[181:10.37]That's just- that's just Steve Bruhl.
[181:11.53]Hey, Triffidy.
[181:34.63]I heard about the trip to Snaktooth and thought, well, I could keep scraping at odds and ends till the day I die.
[181:41.94]Or, I could really get out there.
[181:45.70]Try following in Grandma's footsteps.
[181:48.98]Alright, who is Grandma?
[181:50.38]Lisbert.
[181:50.58]You might have heard of Bronica Ladeblog?
[181:53.50]An adventuring type just like Lisbert.
[181:55.18]Sounds like Sarah Palin.
[181:56.48]She filled up our old house with relics and sketches.
[182:00.07]Taught me to love history.
[182:01.85]Bless her heart.
[182:06.89]Amazing, don't you think?
[182:09.09]We got paintings of Bugsnax from a thousand years ago.
[182:12.53]Just, yeah, just like generic Midwestern.
[182:14.28]Grumpus civilization rises, collapses, and turns to dust.
[182:17.58]But the Bugsnax... It's not Norwegian.
[182:19.64]What do you mean Norwegian accent?
[182:21.22]They are walking records of history.
[182:26.61]It's less I left and more I stopped coming back.
[182:31.81]I wasn't even there when the fight broke out.
[182:34.69]Imagine me coming home to find Wambus all red in the face and at Ramble's throat.
[182:43.23]No, no, nothing so simple as that.
[182:45.37]Is it weird that I want this accent to tell me nursery rhymes?
[182:49.92]But he wouldn't give up his farm, not even for me.
[182:53.98]Stubborn fool.
[182:58.15]Lovely gale, that Lisbert.
[183:00.07]Wasn't often we'd both be in town at the same time.
[183:03.15]And when we were... This is my accent.
[183:05.07]Well, go on, start reading us some... No, Hansel and Gretel or whatever.
[183:11.27]...and show off our grisliest scars.
[183:13.45]Adventuring is a dangerous business.
[183:19.37]Archaeology, less so.
[183:21.37]But the Lottoblog method can be unconventional.
[183:26.37]What the fuck are you talking about?
[183:36.11]I hope that she doesn't die in a QTE.
[183:38.54]That's very, very specific.
[183:39.48]Plus, I still think it's funny.
[183:40.34]It's very specific, but I really do think that what you just said is funny.
[183:58.18]Thanks, Tiffany.
[183:58.78]I learned a lot.
[183:59.18]Have fun.
[183:59.60]Time to eat some bugs.
[184:00.38]Bye.
[184:00.50]This is a shitload of subs.
[184:01.54]Uh, WTR6K4DA.
[184:01.88]These are the 20 community subs.
[184:28.88]20 subs.
[184:31.70]Thank you.
[184:32.65]WTR6K4DA.
[184:34.93]Thank you.
[184:39.73]A diary.
[184:40.57]Liz's cabinet key.
[184:42.37]How about the diary?
[184:45.64]What's in there?
[184:46.28]You picked up Liz's notes on a secret code.
[184:50.42]Holy crap.
[184:58.33]Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates in order.
[185:01.03]First left, and then we don't know.
[185:06.22]Holy crapple.
[185:07.46]Here.
[185:08.44]Why don't you eat... Here, have some... Have some baked potato in the tinfoil.
[185:16.64]Oh, god.
[185:21.08]Ah...
[185:25.58]Those of you guys with fillings, putting tinfoil in your mouth is just get it out and get it away.
[185:31.07]Oh my god, that's horrible.
[185:36.36]Ah!
[185:36.44]Oh, I hate it.
[185:39.34]Why would they do that?
[185:41.17]How you doing?
[185:42.11]Okay, let's donate a Ribble Pede.
[185:46.81]We have to do them all.
[185:47.87]Shy, weenie, worm, spuddy, and a pop tick.

[185:54.17]Oh, there we go.
[185:54.73]By how much?
[185:57.13]By two?
[185:57.47]Twelve donations now.

[186:54.31]Wiggle would like to talk to you about something at the beach.
[187:00.20]Turn the grumps to Snackberg.
[187:01.58]Okay, so I have to get everyone to come back and then interview everyone.
[187:04.90]That's the main quest.
[187:06.36]What about this one?
[187:07.74]Do I enjoy this game so far?
[187:08.82]Yeah, it's good.
[187:10.54]Let's go to this one.
[187:11.51]Let's track that one.
[187:13.17]Let's go to the beach.
[187:20.30]Why are you playing this?
[187:25.63]It's very cute.
[187:26.57]I could see how this would be relaxing and fun to play.
[187:34.21]We're looking for the guitar player.
[187:39.79]Sweetie fly zips around fast to evade traps, but eventually sets down to rest.
[187:45.19]I don't want to catch it.
[187:45.77]Where are you landing?
[187:48.58]Land over on that rock there.
[187:50.84]Alright.
[187:51.16]Gonna get your ass.
[187:57.06]What do you like?
[188:03.11]Catch up?
[188:04.25]No.
[188:04.67]Alright, you'll come down here and land.
[188:06.37]I'll be ready.
[188:21.91]I got a lovely sweetie fly.
[188:25.31]Is there legendaries in this game or shinies like Pokémon?
[188:31.36]Hi.
[188:32.18]Aloha, darling.
[188:33.66]Welcome to Wiggle Wiggle Bottom's steamy walking tour.
[188:37.92]Lucky you.
[188:38.48]It's an ooey gooey sweetie fly.
[188:40.83]Oh, I can see you're utterly starstruck.
[188:44.11]Don't fret, darling.
[188:45.41]I always have time for my fans.
[188:51.95]You want me to come back to town?
[188:55.01]Darling, it will have to wait.
[188:57.25]I simply cannot rest until I find my muse.
[189:01.17]And by muse, I mean Bud Snacks.
[189:02.83]Change starts from the outside in, darling.
[189:07.37]If I want new ideas, I need a new look.
[189:11.59]How about a wild new hairdo?
[189:13.75]Get me a pineapple and we'll see what we can do.
[189:18.26]Okay, you want Pinatula hair.
[189:20.90]But what about a Sweetie Fly beard?
[189:28.54]Oh, cool!
[189:33.10]But how can you ever play the guitar again?
[189:34.58]Alright, let's dig one up.
[189:37.98]Has this ruined her career?
[189:49.65]Alright, your trajectory is here.
[189:51.27]Get dug out of the ground.
[189:53.35]Cover you in, I believe it's chocolate.
[189:58.09]Ow.
[189:59.37]Alright, somebody dig that up.
[190:06.83]Chocolate!
[190:13.81]Right there!
[190:14.37]Is that gonna both?
[190:20.77]Oh, I doubled it up.
[190:21.51]I didn't know you could do that.
[190:23.44]I thought only one could fit in there.
[190:29.16]That's cool to know.
[190:29.68]Alright, here you go.
[190:33.97]Pineapple head.
[190:41.06]Yeah, that struck a chord.
[190:43.34]With a new head, I can think new thoughts.
[190:46.74]That's the magic of Bugsnax.
[190:49.32]Now my creative juices can flow.
[190:52.74]This is my favorite character.
[190:55.40]I know I'm flowing.
[190:56.28]I'm flowing.
[190:57.16]You and me are going to be really, really good friends.
[191:06.60]I can already tell.
[191:07.43]This flow is more of a dribble.
[191:10.19]Grapesquito?
[191:10.75]Some Bugsnax are only around at certain times.
[191:14.74]You can scan evidence in the environment to get a clue about where to find them.
[191:17.92]Okay.
[191:18.08]Grapesquito.
[191:18.92]I go find like grape juice on the ground.
[191:39.61]Evidence.
[191:39.91]Fruity goop.
[191:42.53]This fruity leafy glob is evidence of a bug snack.
[191:45.26]This bug snack seems to appear at night, but not when it's raining.
[191:50.66]Alright, let's sleep.
[191:51.42]Look at that great mosquito.
[191:55.66]Do you have a bed in your house?
[192:01.35]Where's the bed?
[192:12.09]Alright, sleep until midnight.
[192:18.23]I just heard it.
[192:18.77]Somebody just said their name.
[192:19.59]It's for free.
[192:26.73]That's free.
[192:27.31]Alright, great mosquito.
[192:32.23]Just heard it.
[192:36.20]That would be a great mosquito.
[192:39.16]This one plumps up and slows down if it eats another bug snack, and it loves chocolate.
[192:43.76]So, um, let's cover this in chocolate.
[192:48.04]Go eat it.
[192:50.00]Let's get him.
[192:52.37]There you go.
[192:52.99]There's your great mosquito.
[192:56.99]Why is the cap of gold?
[192:57.97]I don't know.
[192:58.87]I haven't figured that out yet.
[193:04.25]Okay, here's your great mosquito.
[193:07.13]Great mosquito.
[193:09.26]did you want it did you want it on your hand oh I never played the guitar again I bandaged up both of your hands and now the ideas will blow they're gonna flow oh any second now come on now I assure you
[193:35.33]You're my favorite political streamer.
[193:37.45]Thanks, man.
[193:38.99]We go over the issues here.
[193:40.13]And... And... That's why you're here.
[193:41.45]To listen to me talk about the issues.
[193:44.08]And... And...
[194:06.31]Ooh, catch two pop sticks.
[194:11.46]I'm a fix America.
[194:18.39]I'm just a clown.
[194:23.27]I'm just a clown, man.
[194:24.57]I can't fix anything.
[194:32.56]Like Bozo the Clown.
[194:33.66]Like fucking Richard Nixon didn't pull Bozo the Clown in and go, we need to fight.
[194:38.63]Excuse me, Bozo.
[194:40.23]How do you feel about foreign policy?
[194:41.81]I just entertain children.
[194:46.83]Perfect.
[194:47.17]You get on the board.
[194:47.92]You're perfect for us.
[194:53.52]Not implying that you guys are children.
[194:55.08]I'm implying that you're children.
[194:56.18]None of you guys are children.
[194:56.82]Maybe some of you are.
[194:57.84]But you had to click that 18 plus logo when you got to the stream first.
[195:01.61]So, you might be lying.
[195:03.27]Don't lie.
[195:03.89]It's not good.
[195:04.37]Two pop sticks.
[195:08.59]Wait, is that the popcorn?
[195:14.68]Alright, I gotta get two pop sticks.
[195:24.29]I'm out.
[195:29.76]Gotta go to the fire land.
[195:32.32]Does this game ever get interesting?
[195:36.04]I mean, that depends on what you think is interesting.
[195:38.43]You think collecting bugs and taking pictures is interesting?
[195:42.09]Then you're gonna love it.
[195:47.17]You think this is dumb?
[195:51.48]I don't think you probably wouldn't want to play it.
[195:53.10]If you don't think that picking up food bugs is cool.
[195:57.01]This is not the game for you.
[196:01.95]Let's just complete this now because I know that it's available.
[196:04.71]So let's go to Burning Gorge.
[196:07.52]And...
[196:21.95]Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery.
[196:27.91]I can't even.
[196:29.19]Alright.
[196:30.41]Let's get these two.
[196:33.31]Fire!
[196:34.76]Fire!
[196:39.38]No, you burnt my thing!
[196:44.32]Alright, you'll come out eventually.
[196:48.90]Did you just torch my shit?
[196:52.98]No!
[196:54.18]Is he gonna burn?
[196:56.10]Why are you doing this, dude?
[197:06.12]The bush is on fire!
[197:08.19]Oh no.
[197:09.11]It's okay, just burn all the bushes so they can't run away.
[197:21.01]Stop!
[197:36.26]Stop burning them!
[197:37.22]Stop letting them on fire!
[197:38.27]Can I put them out?
[197:50.51]I can't put them out.
[197:51.24]Hey, you!
[197:55.74]Fuck off!
[198:02.40]Lead them to the river.
[198:07.24]Oh, there we go!
[198:08.18]Oh my fucking god, stop.
[198:20.43]Kill the scorpion?
[198:21.39]I can't!
[198:29.03]How am I supposed to kill it?
[198:29.91]Throw poop.
[198:40.66]Launch pad.
[198:41.30]Okay, I'm gonna throw a rock at this motherfucker, I swear to God.
[198:44.18]I have to- how do I get- what do you hate?
[198:59.42]You hate spicy food, but you love mustard food.
[199:03.22]I don't have any of that stuff.
[199:05.30]He's distracted.
[199:13.88]No!
[199:15.18]Get sauce near Danny.
[199:19.98]Who the fuck is Danny?
[199:24.55]How do I lure these guys away?

[203:23.88]Whatever, I'll be back.
[203:24.52]I'm gonna feed the pop ticks to a guitar person.
[203:40.97]I might be able to bounce myself.
[203:48.21]I'm gonna donate the other ones.
[203:51.65]And I'll bring the two pop ticks to the lady.
[203:54.07]So donate, donate, donate.

[204:05.66]Thank you so much.
[204:07.76]Hopefully my little ones will settle down.
[204:10.30]Maybe I can even start training them again.
[204:12.40]Quest complete.
[204:19.02]Now to the beach.
[204:24.85]Maybe this will be enough for her to go back to town.
[204:30.08]Everybody in this game is creepy.
[204:32.40]Yeah, a little.
[204:48.15]Where'd you go?
[204:53.08]Where is she?
[204:54.81]isn't there house like right here she's dead no she's not right here okay two pop ticks I guess you're gonna have popcorn feet that's the only thing that's available right
[205:22.61]Hold his feet.
[205:24.47]I look ridiculous, and I don't have a single new tune in my head.
[205:29.98]What a woeful journey I've taken.
[205:36.56]Darling, I apologize for putting you through such an ordeal.
[205:41.86]It was all for the sake of art.
[205:44.39]What do I think of the theme song?
[205:45.71]And art is priceless.
[205:48.72]Is there a theme song to this game?
[205:50.36]Have we heard it?
[205:59.73]You want to do full, total, just transformation to Bugstack?
[206:03.21]Every limb?
[206:03.47]Every... appendage?
[206:04.35]Oh, no, you're going back.
[206:05.51]Good.
[206:18.75]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[206:33.24]What other quests?
[206:33.86]Okay, the cheese poofs.
[206:40.94]Anybody else have anything to do?
[206:44.78]Maybe somebody back in town will have something.
[206:46.74]Because the cheese poop, I kind of want it.
[206:48.68]Who cares?
[206:51.73]Make her all popcorn.
[206:53.41]I'm sure you could do that to somebody.
[206:54.53]Alright, let's go.
[206:55.73]Wait.
[206:56.51]Is that new?
[206:58.89]No, no.
[207:01.79]I'm going to try to do the cheese poop thing.
[207:10.95]Go get the sub.
[207:12.63]I'm not sure I'm ready for the sub.
[207:23.40]Listen to the theme song.
[207:29.92]What do... What do... Where... What do you mean the theme song?
[207:33.29]Oh, I got a new assignment.
[207:34.09]Ghost stories.
[207:38.09]Hold on.
[207:38.55]Is it... Is it on like YouTube?
[207:40.89]Bug.
[207:42.14]Snacks.
[207:43.14]Theme song.
[207:51.93]Kiro Kiro Bunito.
[207:54.16]It's Bugsnax.
[208:05.87]See you in three days when you get banned.
[208:08.97]How would I get banned?
[208:09.81]Is this like TOS?
[208:12.53]It's alright.
[208:24.89]EMCA what isn't that in the game it has singing it's Dean wait isn't that song in this game So what's the difference if I if the song is in this game versus I play it on YouTube is it no Alright, that was an in-game I have was all kind of computers that determine it I
[208:52.46]Hey, guys, we just listened to the Kiro Kiro Bonito song.
[208:54.78]It's Bugsnax.
[208:56.20]Yeah, none of you will ever buy music ever again.
[208:59.49]That's right.
[209:02.13]That makes sense to you, doesn't it?
[209:03.25]Hey, I just listened to this song that I really like.
[209:13.61]I'm canceling my Spotify.
[209:15.42]I'm never paying for music ever again because of that, because I listened to that song.
[209:23.39]What's the logic behind this?
[209:24.73]I don't understand.
[209:25.35]That's exactly... That's exactly it.
[209:46.67]It's really weird because I feel like they're just throwing out a gigantic net to hopefully make like pennies on every dollar.
[209:53.59]You know what I mean?
[209:54.73]And if you do that enough times, if you just throw out a gigantic net, when you make potentially like a quarter of a penny from like 600 million things, it's worth it apparently.
[210:14.10]Wait, are we doing a party?
[210:18.02]And by the way, why put this shit on YouTube?
[210:21.22]Beats sitting in the dark.
[210:23.18]I tell you, there's some spooky stuff out there.
[210:25.80]There ain't nothing out there.
[210:29.05]Why upload these songs to YouTube?
[210:31.21]You're just yellow.
[210:32.87]I'm not yellow.
[210:33.97]Are we not allowed to listen to these songs?
[210:36.35]Unless we're like fucking locked in our basements with all the lights are all off and our windows are all closed?
[210:41.36]I've seen something similar up on top of the canyon.
[210:44.70]Real curious.
[210:46.79]Oh, we're missing somebody.
[210:57.47]about something else you know the desert grumps oh shit guys guys guys with a dead going to rise from the grave no not shit it's more the bodies would just
[211:19.20]Nobody's gonna pick that up.
[211:20.24]Pick that up.
[211:20.72]Pick that up.
[211:21.16]Pick that up.
[211:22.16]I don't want that.
[211:25.06]Something smells delicious.
[211:26.76]What's that?
[211:27.24]It smells like roasted strawberry.
[211:29.81]Oh, it's me.
[211:32.23]Come on.
[211:33.13]Come on.
[211:33.33]That's in every cartoon.

[212:17.73]Oh, what'd you say?
[212:18.43]Oh, that... Oh, what about you?
[212:21.03]You got something to say to me?
[212:24.57]Yeah, line it up real good here.
[212:26.31]Just line it up.
[212:27.51]Let... Alright, we gotta go to the old mill.
[212:37.20]Where's the old mill?
[212:39.38]There it is.
[212:39.98]Alright, let's get some wood.
[212:40.88]Get some firewood.
[212:48.70]Oh, this is the part where I go.
[212:54.66]What's that?
[212:55.10]It's me with the firewood.
[212:59.88]Here you go.
[213:00.52]And then everybody hears the real sound.
[213:02.48]Whoa, that's not me.
[213:04.42]It's back there.
[213:05.02]Run.
[213:06.21]I've seen every cartoon ever.
[213:07.63]Every fucking TV show.
[213:08.61]Every movie.
[213:12.09]No, no zombies listen spooky is the disappearing stiffs maybe that's just a story I read on a wall We got goof around and play the game this whole game is goofing around you pick up bugs and fucking feed them to people Obviously we're not the BioShock So what makes us think all the others are dead I?
[213:34.33]I've seen those chewed-up skeletons around the island.
[213:37.92]We all know something kills Grumpuses out there, and it has teeth.
[213:42.84]Bugsnax don't have teeth.
[213:45.72]And like Wiggles said, there aren't animals out here other than us.
[213:51.57]She's not wrong about the boons.
[213:54.35]Ah, ah, ah, time out.
[213:55.99]I gotta use a little Grumpstrom.
[213:57.61]Now hold on.
[213:58.69]You saying Grumpuses turn cannibal?
[214:00.27]That's ridiculous.
[214:02.27]We ain't got the stomachs for it.
[214:04.69]It's true.
[214:05.09]Oh, it's true It's really like among us characters They have funny late hamburger hats They took a bite out of it
[214:30.44]Is he going to do the thing that I just did?
[214:41.17]Alright.
[214:44.69]Everybody smile.
[214:46.81]We just lost one of our good friends.
[214:48.33]He might be dead.
[214:50.63]Perfect.
[214:51.87]I'll put that on Insta.
[214:56.45]Check on the bathroom.
[215:03.77]Whose bathroom?
[215:07.93]The bathroom.
[215:10.73]Okay, that's not the bathroom.

[215:17.89]Go to the bathroom.
[215:26.73]The bathroom.

[215:30.92]He got up and he ran this way.
[215:32.80]He went, ahhh!
[215:56.48]So if you're there, then who's in there?
[215:58.69]Somebody drowned in there?
[215:59.33]He drowned in there.
[215:59.85]Oh yeah, somebody fell in here and drowned in this poop water.
[216:25.67]That wasn't a monster, that was somebody's final gasps of poop air.
[216:32.74]Damn.
[216:33.72]Oh well.
[216:44.01]Why is there an echo?

[217:42.77]That's precisely right, darling.
[217:45.52]This story makes no sense.
[217:47.34]Why would Bugsnax have a monarchy?
[217:50.02]Oh, Whambus, it's just the title.
[217:52.34]I've seen Bugsnax big enough to eclipse the moon.
[217:56.51]What else would you call that?
[217:58.95]Um, a hallucination?

[221:42.63]When he's, like, hiding behind the wall and those, like, CG enemies are walking towards him.
[221:49.13]And he, like, turns the corner with his little gun and he's like, And it's, like, ten seconds later one of them falls over and dies.
[221:58.31]It's, like, the funniest fucking thing ever.
[222:02.20]Don't worry, folks.
[222:03.68]I'm fine.
[222:06.94]It's so funny.
[222:09.57]And he doesn't even shoot at one point, and two more of them just fall down.
[222:12.97]He just didn't match it up right.
[222:15.72]Things are good and safe and boring.
[222:18.58]wait what if Chandler was the queen of Bugsnax oh it's like 40 minutes long yeah it's pretty long required for royalty yeah if anybody's queen around here it's me you know the desert grumps had a history of matriarchal leadership real fascinating system they had every year the ladies would
[222:40.82]Kylo Ren also did this thing one time.
[222:42.56]It was just un-fucking-believable.
[222:46.13]I think he was at, like, some tournament or something.
[222:49.11]I don't follow League at all, but, you know, I think he's funny.
[222:52.81]He was on stage doing, like, the analyst desk.
[222:58.05]And he shouted out his website to like his merch site.
[223:01.08]They're like, oh, so where'd you get that shirt?
[223:02.48]And he's like, he says, www.taliban.com, discount code alpha.
[223:08.06]He says it so unbelievably fast, like five times in a row.
[223:11.72]It's like, discount code alpha.
[223:15.05]And it's not even like a joke.
[223:16.19]It's not even, oh, wow, you messed that up a little bit.
[223:18.18]He said it perfectly three times in like one, like two tenths of a second.
[223:23.98]And if you slow the video down to like 20 percentile, it's perfect.
[223:37.11]And like the analysts at the desk are like, alright, man.
[223:39.93]Like, okay, that's where you get that.
[223:41.87]Hi there.
[223:47.94]You're simping.
[223:49.32]No, I'm not.
[223:50.30]I can't say that somebody like that, somebody who has like funny content that's also funny.
[224:00.21]You've heard me talk about other streamers before that I thought were funny.
[224:03.55]Well, I can't talk about another one.
[224:12.89]I can't even do it.
[224:14.83]It's impossible.
[224:15.29]I don't even know how he did it.
[224:17.97]Oh, bestie.
[224:19.52]I was just looking for you.
[224:21.54]Now that Wiggles back, Snacksburg is finally interesting again.
[224:26.77]What do you mean, also?
[224:28.79]Because there are other streamers that I think are funny, too.
[224:30.51]You've heard me talk about them.
[224:31.31]Watch it, please.
[224:31.90]I'm begging you.

[227:23.02]I don't think it is.
[227:23.74]I think this is just a fun game that you relax and play for fun.
[227:26.12]It'll be a dark twist.
[227:27.70]I don't think this is gonna be a dark twist.
[227:30.26]Alright, we gotta find out what you do at midnight.
[227:32.47]What time is it?
[227:51.25]Alright, let's go sleep.

[228:38.15]We go.
[228:48.67]We go.
[228:56.54]Go feed Dab Link on stream.
[228:58.82]What are you doing here?
[228:59.96]None of those things are going to happen.
[229:02.10]What are you doing here?
[229:03.48]Well, I'm just looking to spend some time with Gramble.
[229:08.20]Alone.
[229:12.38]She's not happy.
[229:13.10]Alright, well, we have to interview.
[229:14.02]I'm no stranger to interviews, darling.
[229:16.92]Hit me with your best shot.
[229:20.42]Fire away.
[229:21.80]Alright, who are you?
[229:26.46]You've certainly heard my number one single, Do The Wiggle.
[229:32.55]It was stuck in my head for a month.
[229:33.69]You see, Wiggle Wiggle Bottom needs no introduction, darling.
[229:38.65]Why'd you come here?
[229:39.68]Well, I'm here to gorge myself on a new life experience.
[229:44.78]To get my creative juices flowing, as it were.
[229:51.13]Why is juice not flowing?
[229:55.24]You know, no hit can stay on top forever.
[229:58.15]And I'm afraid the audience... Guilty?
[230:01.71]Is this an interrogation?
[230:04.08]It's an interview.
[230:07.76]I've been accused of being a one-hit wiggle.
[230:14.16]every taste is like a star going supernova inside my mouth creative energy like I've never felt before I love the wiggles whatever price I have to pay darling Bugsnax are forbidden fruits darling I believe something exists to keep us from them she will come for me one day
[230:42.95]Okay, why'd you leave?
[230:45.13]What happened to Liz?
[230:48.25]What are you doing here?
[230:49.31]Why are you constantly wiggling?
[231:00.38]Because it's in her name.
[231:02.24]Do you wiggle in your sleep?
[231:04.34]Do you wiggle while you're on the toilet?
[231:07.19]Do you go to the bathroom and wiggle?
[231:08.43]Yeah.
[231:29.48]He wiggled during surgery.
[231:30.32]I just said shut up in all capitals.
[231:31.56]Alright, alright.
[231:44.07]So what happened to her?
[231:44.79]Let's get more info.
[231:45.53]Would you guys think it was funny if I did a stream where every single person in chat was modded?
[231:52.31]And I just had the webcam full cam screaming.
[231:56.11]With like the flight of the bumblebee in the background.
[232:13.39]That'll be the last stream.
[232:17.95]Well, it could be part of the retirement stream.
[232:26.55]Whenever that is.
[232:29.64]Whenever the retirement stream is.
[232:31.98]However long that is away.
[232:32.90]We'll do it then.
[232:41.65]But I swear on my platinum record, it's true.
[232:45.47]If you don't believe me, go and see for yourself.
[232:49.29]Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got music to make.
[232:55.47]I want this character in Smash Bros.
[232:58.95]Alright, Wiggle gave you a map to Liz's last location.
[233:03.66]That's intriguing.
[233:07.68]No.
[233:13.85]Alright, we found it.
[233:14.45]We gotta go back to Becca.
[233:17.64]And then, Wiggle would like to talk to you about something.
[233:20.16]She would?
[233:22.60]What the hell?
[233:23.40]Are you lying on the bed frame?
[233:25.26]Like the headboard?
[233:26.17]That's some discipline.
[233:36.71]If you're not busy, darling, I could use a helping paw.
[233:40.89]It seems like your run-of-the-mill Bugsnax aren't getting my creative juices flowing.
[233:46.67]I need something, oh, spectacular.
[233:51.30]I overheard Whambus talking about a sandopeed.
[233:54.38]Oh, you want the sub sandwich.
[233:55.44]A pack made of many pieces working in harmony.
[233:57.90]That's going to be tricky.
[234:00.16]That may be just what I need.
[234:04.95]Okay, we need to go get the sandipedes.
[234:08.37]Okay.
[234:12.55]I don't want to do that yet.
[234:13.83]I want to do... Let's go complete this one, and then I want... What's that map with the new info on it?
[234:18.53]It's the last location.
[234:21.98]I saw Lizbert looking down on camp from between the trees beneath the snow line.
[234:29.96]Sugar Pine Woods.
[234:33.38]Where the hell are we now?
[234:39.57]We haven't been there yet.
[234:40.23]This is a -2 terrible link.
[234:45.11]Is it?
[234:47.23]Margaret Thatcher.
[234:49.15]That's... What do you want?
[234:53.75]Would you show that on stream?
[235:00.32]I want to go back to Becca.
[235:02.50]Let's go back to Becca.
[235:03.84]Wherever she is.
[235:05.16]She's here somewhere.
[235:06.72]Let's wake her up.
[235:08.84]Go on, Charwee.
[235:10.14]Just follow Papa's pointer.
[235:13.02]Or don't.
[235:13.74]That's fine, too.
[235:15.50]You know, it's weird.
[235:16.32]I don't really like this guy, but I like this guy.
[235:20.24]I don't hate seeing him show up, even though I don't like him.
[235:24.07]We're off to a bit of a slow start.
[235:27.89]It went so easy with Sprout.
[235:29.49]I just don't know what's going wrong now.
[235:32.47]Maybe.
[235:33.59]Maybe Sprout can help.
[235:35.33]I'm sure he could show Charwee the ropes.
[235:37.15]What do you say?
[235:39.05]Uh, yeah, let's do it.
[235:41.57]Okay, here we go.
[235:43.73]Training day.
[235:44.97]Ready?
[235:45.23]Go!
[235:45.51]Why are you not going?
[236:16.00]I don't have any chocolate.
[236:19.60]Oh, yes, I do.
[236:20.16]Alright, lead him back.
[236:38.49]Did you just kick it?
[236:42.72]Why did you kick it?
[236:45.20]What was that for?
[236:45.88]That was rude.
[236:54.05]Alright, let's avoid her.
[237:01.59]She's a problem.
[237:08.71]Hang a right.
[237:13.17]Oh, didn't mean to fall.
[237:16.68]Alright, to the finish.
[237:17.72]Where's the finish line?
[237:18.66]In here.
[237:24.21]Up and over the thing.
[237:27.65]You did it!
[237:34.62]Throwing for content.
[237:35.92]You can hold to drag it.
[237:36.94]It's alright.
[237:38.59]What did that get me?
[237:39.49]I feel like I know people that look like this guy.
[237:42.27]Is that weird to say?
[238:11.50]Alright, what were we doing?
[238:13.18]Oh, I was talking to Becca.
[238:14.10]She's hanging out somewhere around here.
[238:20.18]Where is Becca?
[238:23.38]Didn't she live in a cave somewhere?
[238:26.96]She moved here, didn't she?
[238:27.88]I thought she moved in here.
[238:39.60]She lives in a cave.
[238:41.30]But, I feel, didn't everybody come back to town?
[238:43.42]That's her house.
[238:48.43]Where is she?
[238:48.85]Look for the purple house, dude.
[238:54.57]There she is.
[238:58.29]Holding that camera the whole time.
[239:01.23]Please say Bugsnax.
[239:03.97]Probably have a hundred times this is the last four hours.
[239:08.38]In my old life, I would have killed to get dirt on Wiggle Wiggle Bottom.
[239:14.61]I used to take pictures for GMZ, you know, and whoever else might be buying.
[239:18.93]How much would have, okay, if you had a camera and you're outside my Walmart or something and you found me and you videotaped me being like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, how's the new stream coming?
[239:31.55]How's the stream going?
[239:32.86]And I was like, get the fuck away from me.
[239:34.10]Fuck off.
[239:35.18]And I got in my car and drove away.
[239:36.56]How much would that get you on like TMZ?
[239:41.28]I was like, I got places to be.
[239:42.36]Leave me the fuck alone.
[239:43.24]Get the fuck away from me.
[239:44.26]What would it be worth?
[239:53.53]1500 bucks?
[239:56.27]That's kind of a lot considering.
[239:58.97]Oh, right.
[239:59.89]I almost forgot about
[240:02.12]Yeah, I wouldn't be on the TMZ front page.
[240:04.37]I'd be on TMZ 2.
[240:05.25]That would be a Sunday article.
[240:07.39]That wouldn't be a prime time, like Thursday afternoon.
[240:10.99]That's a Sunday at... Sunday at like... I don't know, like 4 a.m.
[240:35.62]Catch one crispy snack pod.
[240:42.06]Where's the best place to get a crispy snack pod?
[240:44.04]Did she just tell me and I wasn't paying attention?
[240:46.32]Probably.
[240:47.90]I would assume that's what happened.
[240:51.76]Ethica told me about a snack that hides in her old cave.
[240:54.69]Okay, we gotta go back to her.
[240:55.75]Where's her old cave?
[240:59.17]Up this way, right?
[241:12.11]This way?
[241:15.30]It's this way, right?
[241:20.28]Get on the front page.
[241:24.38]Alright, so if I'm not... Oh, hey, Mr. Elbertson, can we get a moment?
[241:28.92]What if I... Okay, here's another story.
[241:31.74]So instead of, hey, get the fuck out of here, fuck off, I say, hey, get the fuck out of here, fuck off, and then I get in my car and just start doing donuts in the parking lot with the middle finger out the window at you.
[241:41.93]Does that improve my chances?
[241:46.42]Like, get, like, on, get some traction there.
[241:55.94]You just get arrested.
[241:59.22]But officer, I just wanted to get on TMZ.
[242:01.89]Alright, what is this bug?
[242:06.87]Is this a secret snack pod?
[242:10.31]Oh shit, there it is.
[242:32.88]That's how you get on TMZ.
[242:34.14]Yeah, but then my entire career is over.
[242:37.61]Career, career in quotes.
[242:39.07]He said career.
[242:51.42]Oh, new quest.
[242:53.86]But we gotta turn this in first.
[242:56.98]Where are you?
[242:57.42]Where are you?
[242:57.80]Where are you?
[242:58.18]Where are you?
[242:58.64]Freed.
[243:00.52]Feed one crispy snack.
[243:07.78]They're all doing the walk.
[243:09.66]This is Wiggle's house.
[243:21.25]Where is she?
[243:23.47]Bilbo's house.
[243:27.24]There she is.
[243:28.18]There she is.
[243:37.96]I brought your old bag of potato chips.
[243:43.58]Oh, yeah.
[243:47.45]Can't say I miss that cave, but I do miss these.
[243:51.19]Thanks, bestie.
[243:55.59]I wish I didn't do anything for you ever.
[244:02.62]Oh, Waldo has something.
[244:04.38]Or Wompo.
[244:05.24]Wompus.
[244:06.34]Rompus.
[244:06.66]Whatever his name is.
[244:07.28]Doesn't he have a quest?
[244:09.40]He was just right here.
[244:09.90]Where'd he go?
[244:10.26]Hey!
[244:22.91]Hey, man.
[244:28.70]Oh, dude.
[244:29.60]I see you're on a Tempur-Pedic.
[244:30.74]He has a journey.
[244:32.32]If you can move around all you want, your partner will never feel it and never see it.
[244:35.47]Take a look at this egg.
[244:36.17]Take a look at this wine glass.
[244:37.83]Wake up.
[244:38.15]I'm talking to you.
[244:46.64]No, is there no bed sheet on this bed?
[244:49.62]Spuddy.
[244:51.97]Okay, catch a spuddy.
[244:53.65]That's out in Creek Canyon.
[245:17.86]These are just meat body parts.
[245:21.80]You think they smell?
[245:22.64]I feel like after a few days that she's just gonna stink.
[245:32.75]It would just smell like the inside of a fucking restaurant kitchen.
[245:35.95]Everywhere.
[245:36.33]Alright, get a spuddy from, uh, Creek Canyon.
[245:47.64]Get some sauce.
[245:48.38]That's a good call.
[245:50.14]That is a good call.
[245:50.82]I'll get some.
[245:58.43]Attention.
[245:58.89]Streamer.
[245:59.31]Attention.
[245:59.71]What is it?
[246:01.03]Fetish alert.
[246:05.51]Sure.
[246:05.97]Okay.
[246:06.41]Whatever you say.
[246:08.35]Whatever you say.
[246:09.24]Alright, that should be enough.
[246:32.19]It always hurts whenever you sound- Jemra sounds defeated.
[246:36.32]Defeated?
[246:36.84]Why am I defeated?
[246:39.96]I'm energized.
[246:41.92]Not really, but I could be.
[246:43.42]Alright, there's a spuddy.
[246:45.84]To get a spuddy, you need a spuddy to attack another spuddy.
[246:49.08]Oh, here you go.
[246:49.56]You two.
[246:50.19]Fight each other.
[246:52.07]And I'll get two.
[246:56.69]Follow me.
[246:57.69]Wait, what do you guys hate?
[247:00.59]Hate each other.
[247:01.27]Right.
[247:05.72]Who's gonna get the ketchup?
[247:07.20]This fresh ketchup here, who's gonna get it?
[247:08.64]Look what I got.
[247:13.78]Hey, look what I got over here.
[247:23.52]All this trick in the book.
[247:25.80]Oh, this is hot sauce.
[247:26.72]Finally.
[247:30.94]It's not even the oldest trick in the book.
[247:32.12]I just said that because it was easy.
[247:34.71]Alright, but you.
[247:35.27]How do I get you?
[247:36.95]I feel like I probably can't just jump and catch it.
[247:48.42]I'll try.
[247:48.70]Damn it.
[248:07.12]I need three of those, right?
[248:12.12]That was a complete mess.
[248:14.96]Fuck.
[248:49.70]I don't think I can do this.
[248:56.37]Yes, I can.
[248:58.89]White Cheepoof.
[248:59.65]That's not a regular Cheepoof.
[249:05.50]Will you take a white Cheepoof?
[249:12.70]Oh, yeah.
[249:13.32]I can do more than one of the regular and white.
[249:16.18]Alright, let's go.
[249:18.34]I'll get this one here, too.
[249:21.94]Launchpad this.
[249:24.32]Oh.
[249:29.50]There's one right here.
[249:30.36]Wait.
[249:30.74]Pick up this stuff.
[249:34.29]Pirate's Booty?
[249:34.89]That shit is unbelievable, by the way.
[249:39.39]I love Pirate's Booty.
[249:41.61]Never buy it, though.
[249:46.36]Shit.
[250:00.93]Hurry!
[250:01.27]Alright, one more.
[250:04.83]Is there one over here?
[250:10.81]Yeah, smart food used to be really good, but I don't know.
[250:13.77]It's a little too messy.
[250:15.34]Pirate's booty is the same flavor as smart food, but less gross shit all over your hands.
[250:37.69]You still get that great white cheddar flavor.
[250:40.79]But without the mess.
[250:42.85]It's great.
[250:43.15]I love it.
[250:44.65]Where'd he go?
[250:51.64]I don't eat hipster food.
[250:54.10]Pirate's booty hipster food.
[250:57.16]Explain that one to me somehow.
[250:59.70]Maybe I can catch the peppers like that.
[251:01.22]Maybe.
[251:01.36]Maybe.
[251:10.79]Is that just french fry?
[251:11.49]That's a sweet potato french fry!
[251:49.92]Nice.
[252:25.02]Alright, sweet potato french fry.
[252:26.18]Got it.
[252:26.42]Alright, I need one more cheese poof.
[252:28.36]Oh, hey.
[252:34.37]Oh, hey!
[252:42.03]And there's the cheesy poof right there.
[252:43.85]Let's get up here so this guy cannot keep ramming me.
[252:48.03]That's not fair and it's annoying and it makes me angry.
[252:57.23]Alright, right here.
[253:02.65]Damn it!
[253:29.89]That's three.
[253:30.29]Alright, I got two quests done.
[253:33.53]Just like that.
[253:33.97]Are you going to go back to town?
[253:40.58]But don't feed him.
[253:41.50]Yeah, actually, do feed him.
[253:43.10]Feed him three cheesy poofs.
[253:48.04]One.
[253:49.74]And the two legs.
[253:50.40]Alright, good.
[253:57.92]Okay, okay.
[253:58.96]I know you're just itching to get your paws on that bridge, so I'll cut you a deal, friend.
[254:03.54]Is this to get through an area?
[254:05.40]But it's on this ridiculously tall rock, and it wasn't exactly blessed with stilts.
[254:09.81]Wouldn't happen to be a sweet frider, would it?
[254:11.71]It would.
[254:15.95]Fride.
[254:16.41]Ho, ho, ho, ho.
[254:21.82]Pleasure doing business with you.
[254:23.72]Hey, you're my best and only customer.
[254:28.33]I'm starting to think I should get a better location back in Snacksburg.
[254:32.27]But moving all this inventory across the desert is real sweaty work.
[254:36.83]I'll need a way to keep cool.
[254:38.85]If you make both my feet into big bobsicles, then walking the hot sands would be a breeze.
[254:45.72]God, I gotta warn you.
[254:47.52]You won't find bobsicles in the desert.
[254:50.20]Better look elsewhere, pal.
[254:51.81]I need to snow zone.
[254:52.71]Okay, I need to turn your feet into bopsicles.
[254:55.73]Does anybody get that reference?
[255:09.10]Really?
[255:10.46]That's sad that nobody knows what that is.
[255:20.48]That's sad.
[255:45.35]Maybe next time you wear... New starship in cosmic flavors.
[255:57.78]My sock.
[256:00.16]My bum.
[256:01.44]My bum.
[256:14.36]Who the hell am I?
[256:23.10]Oh, he put the bridge down.
[256:25.74]Wait, that's a different kind of burger.
[256:27.30]That's a sesame seed bun burger.
[256:28.70]That's a bacon burger.
[256:30.78]I want the bacon bunker burger.
[256:35.46]I want to put this... Hold on.
[256:37.04]Bacon bunker burger.
[256:37.82]I need to knock you out.
[256:40.53]Follow me.
[256:40.91]What do you love?
[256:43.22]It's a Barbecue Bunger.
[256:44.38]It's a Barbecue Bacon Bunger Burger.
[256:46.14]This Barbecue Bacon Bunger Burger is... Does he like?
[256:49.06]This Barbecue Bacon Bunger Burger is much more aggressive than its forest cousin.
[256:53.06]It loves ketchup.
[256:54.54]Alright.
[256:54.76]Let's go start a fight.
[257:01.34]Go off the cliff.
[257:07.63]Off the cliff.
[257:10.63]No, not me.
[257:14.01]Oh, not me?
[257:14.89]Where's my launch pad?
[257:31.13]What the fuck?
[257:32.79]Alright, launch pad.
[257:38.41]Hey, get over here, you barbecue bacon burger.
[257:46.16]Still, what?
[257:46.66]You're still fine.
[257:47.84]Will you guys fight?
[257:52.64]Got it.
[257:53.24]I got the barbecue bacon bunker burger.
[257:57.32]I'm saving that one.
[258:03.64]What else did I have to do?
[258:04.26]Let's see.
[258:08.02]Soiled.
[258:08.66]Wampus is looking for some material.
[258:10.06]Okay, I had the spuddy.
[258:11.78]And then I gotta catch the sub.
[258:13.21]Alright, let's return the spuddy.
[258:18.86]Somebody said to try this.
[258:19.94]Let's see if this works.
[258:20.56]If this works, that's pretty cool.
[258:30.41]Whatever.
[258:48.94]Oh, I could go for a BBQ Bacon Bunger Burger right now.
[258:56.12]Who has the best bacon burger out of the fast food restaurants?
[259:01.68]Wendy's, but I don't like the... Wendy's bacon is kind of cold and shitty.
[259:11.56]I love Wendy's burgers, but if you get bacon on them, they're kind of cold.
[259:17.86]Five Guys?
[259:19.34]That's true.
[259:19.88]Five Guys could be pretty good.
[259:23.10]Five Guys Bacon Burger probably is the best bet, I would say.
[259:27.31]But that's not really fast.
[259:28.49]That's kind of a tier up.
[259:30.83]Guess what I'm gonna say?
[259:34.95]No, that's my BBQ Bacon Bunker Burger, not yours.
[259:38.58]Make VLT?
[259:38.76]No.
[259:38.82]Dave's single?
[259:39.16]I really do like the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger, but it's weird.
[259:41.62]This might just be my problem, but I don't think it is.
[259:44.08]Almost every time I've ordered a
[260:09.08]Junior Bacon Cheeseburger from Wendy's.
[260:11.36]It's been cold.
[260:13.52]Just is.
[260:16.16]I've ordered it probably hundreds of times over the last 10, 15 years.
[260:21.50]At least 100 times.
[260:23.00]It's always cold.
[260:26.78]It tastes great and it's really good.
[260:28.68]What's going on, Wiggle?
[260:31.06]Hi!
[260:31.22]Get out of my face.

[261:39.57]Alright, then we scoop up the... This is gross.
[261:42.07]I didn't have enough time, but it would have been...
[262:08.40]Let's eat?
[262:09.90]Let's eat it?
[262:13.12]I'm sorry, but the first thing that somebody says to you when you come out of the bathroom after diarrhea should not be, let's eat.
[262:30.00]And I'm standing right in front of the door that he came out of.
[262:34.02]Howdy.
[262:36.58]Hey, how's it going?
[262:40.53]Oh, you want this.
[262:41.39]Here's your fertilizer.

[273:39.91]You know?
[273:40.49]Like, he has a cinnamon roll on his leg.
[273:41.91]He can't pretend he didn't eat a cinnamon roll.
[273:45.87]Oh, hey, dude.
[273:46.69]You still on that diet?
[273:48.73]Still on the diet, right?

[274:05.70]Move along, interloper.
[274:07.80]Whatever sort of spy or counteragent you are, I'm not about to fall for your tricks.
[274:13.30]There's chemtrails in the snack bug world.
[274:16.23]Why did I read that?
[274:18.85]Move along, interloper.
[274:27.85]I don't see any you lied to me
[274:38.35]He said it.
[274:39.75]Yeah, I know.
[274:42.56]He said it.
[274:43.16]He said it.
[274:45.86]I'm so stupid.
[274:52.92]I thought you just said that to be funny.
[274:54.84]I didn't even listen.
[274:55.84]Guys, they may as well be speaking a different language.
[274:58.66]I haven't paid attention in three and a half hours.
[275:01.48]I just see funny green cartoon characters that feed him insects.
[275:05.50]That's all I know.
[275:07.01]Nah, I'm good.
[275:08.85]I mean, I like being in town, but it gives Snorpy mad anxiety.
[275:14.48]Why don't you talk to him?
[275:16.68]He's not good with strangers, so tell him I sent you.
[275:22.37]Okay, so I'll talk to Snorpy.
[275:26.75]Oh, he did, did he?
[275:28.65]My poor sweet Chandler has always been too trusting.
[275:32.07]What is your business with me?
[275:33.59]You have glasses for your glasses?
[275:37.11]I'm not disinterested, but you're still a suspicious individual.
[275:42.19]I propose a test.
[275:43.69]Here, take my newest invention, the snack grappler.
[275:47.61]I built it so that I could help Chandler with his basketballing problem.
[275:51.89]I forgot that meant going outside, so you do it, and then maybe we'll talk.
[275:57.85]Okay, you got the snack grappler.
[276:01.25]Switch to your snack grappler by holding Q.
[276:07.83]Ooh.
[276:10.33]Wait, are you telling me I can just grab shit out of the air now?
[276:17.97]What is that thing?
[276:19.41]What the hell is that thing?
[276:22.52]Give it to me.
[276:23.16]I want it.
[276:25.46]It's a Charmallow.
[276:26.84]This snack is literally on fire.
[276:28.36]It's from water or ice.
[276:29.86]I love it.
[276:32.33]Oh, I love it.
[276:35.81]I hear another one.
[276:37.17]What do I hear?
[276:39.17]A sprinkle peed.
[276:40.63]It likes to climb high on structures, maybe move some sauce.
[276:43.89]Where is it?
[276:46.93]Where's this thing?
[276:50.50]Where's the sprinkle peed?
[276:57.00]Conspiracy board.
[277:02.50]Tower.
[277:03.30]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[277:04.20]Snail.
[277:07.20]A Cinesnail.
[277:08.16]Very slow, very sticky.
[277:09.30]It likes to stay far out of reach.
[277:12.26]Not for long.
[277:15.46]How do I... How do I grab it?
[277:16.98]How do I pull it from here?
[277:17.86]How do you get it?
[277:23.10]It's too sticky.
[277:28.47]Well, I know what to do.
[277:54.25]Oh shit, I gotta go over there too.
[277:55.79]Launch me!

[278:12.31]What?
[278:15.41]He freezes shit.
[278:17.81]Don't touch me.
[278:18.75]Don't touch me bro!
[278:28.48]Alright, I need to use the sticky thing to trap him, but then how do I... You, come here.
[278:34.60]Oh, I need a bopsicle.
[278:35.62]Freezing anything that touches it.
[278:36.62]There must be a way to melt its icy armor.
[278:38.44]Oh my god, you little weirdo.
[278:42.04]Come here.
[278:50.27]Give this back!
[278:52.15]Hey, popsicle.
[279:05.97]Popsicle.
[279:08.09]Popsicle.
[279:12.31]Alright, come here, freeze him.

[279:31.89]He's laughing at him!
[279:34.29]Get him!
[279:37.23]Oh my god!
[279:37.89]Okay, now what do I do to you?
[279:43.90]Don't- what?
[279:46.28]Use the net?
[279:46.76]I can't pick him up.
[279:47.36]I need to melt him.
[279:50.00]Wait, what are you like?
[279:52.26]You love chocolate!
[279:52.96]Oh my god, you love chocolate.
[280:05.73]Get him!
[280:08.53]Okay, now we have to flip him over.

[285:07.14]Check this out, ready?
[285:07.72]Oh, I can't stand there, nevermind.

[285:46.10]That's cool.
[285:46.81]Alright, I have to turn something into one of these guys, right?
[285:53.81]And then I have the two bopsicles.

[285:59.43]Oh.

[286:03.31]And low.
[286:05.17]Where'd he go?
[286:08.95]Where's Chandler?
[286:09.71]He ran away.
[286:10.13]Chandler, where'd you go?
[286:16.85]It said follow.
[286:17.53]I know, but I wanted to... Where'd he go?
[286:19.42]I have no idea where he is.
[286:23.92]Follow me!
[286:24.86]I turned and go completely opposite way and talk to guy in cabin.
[286:30.86]Where'd he go?
[286:32.28]He went to basketball?
[286:34.36]Um...
[286:39.98]Which way is basketball again?
[286:55.62]This way.
[286:59.60]Launch.
[287:03.82]Oh, there he is.
[287:08.43]Check it out.
[287:09.77]My own personal dunk zone.
[287:12.49]Problem is, I lost my balls.
[287:16.20]They're stuck all over the place.
[287:18.78]I'm sure I could get them down without your help, but Snorpy made that grapple thing for me, and I want to see it in action.
[287:26.04]Are these guys going to go back to town?
[287:28.16]I put Chandler's basketballs into the basket.
[287:41.49]dude.
[288:02.38]You know, in an NBA Jam for the Super Nintendo, if you went all the way to the edge like this, it was almost a guaranteed swish every single time as long as you held the button for like one second.
[288:37.76]The fuck is going on?
[289:18.69]Alright, Chandler.
[289:19.49]Come on, whatever.
[289:20.95]Chandler, let's go.
[289:21.66]He must have fallen off.
[289:23.58]No, that was just a way to trick me.
[289:26.28]See, then he runs away.
[289:47.58]He's trying to get rid of me.
[289:48.54]Hey, look over there.
[289:50.64]Nice dump truck, bro.
[289:51.76]Fuck out of the way.

[295:47.09]By the way.
[295:47.39]Fucking launched.
[296:03.17]Hey, you have a secret project.
[296:04.45]Ah, yes.
[296:05.47]I wish I could tell Chandler everything, but knowing the truth would only put him in more danger.
[296:11.80]Anyway, you have my thanks for helping him.
[296:14.32]Perhaps I can trust you after all.
[296:17.70]Suck all the air out of a basketball?
[296:19.16]Engineer and seeker of truth.

[297:03.01]Oh.
[297:03.65]What's this?
[297:30.88]Ooh, final tool.
[297:35.60]I just tried to hit right click to aim down sights.
[297:39.82]You got the trip shot.
[297:47.83]I didn't shoot it.
[297:50.81]Why did I not fire it?
[297:52.69]Deploy.
[297:53.65]Oh, it's not a gun.
[297:59.35]It's like a century.
[298:00.61]Okay, I get it.
[298:01.63]What's happening?
[298:18.71]Ugh, yawn.

[298:55.18]What's up, bro?
[299:04.53]chum I have such a craving for cookies why my craving is so terrible that I would like my teeth to be cookies so that I may taste my own teeth you see there was an old story about this kid that anything that he ate was chocolate didn't matter what it was
[299:30.70]Anything he put in his mouth, it turned to chocolate and he ate it.
[299:33.38]And he ended up hating it after a while.
[299:37.22]He would drink out of a fountain.
[299:38.82]It would be chocolate milk in his mouth.
[299:41.34]Chocolate in his mouth.
[299:43.76]And there was some lesson there that he had to learn.
[299:45.66]And it was something like, if you eat the same food over and over again, it sucks and you get sick of it.
[299:53.37]He killed his mother by accident and he ate his mother.
[299:55.65]Oh.
[299:56.49]Well, I don't remember that part of the story.
[300:02.61]Alright, we need a... Actually, I have a cookie.
[300:04.37]I have a cookie.
[300:04.89]Kissed his mother and she turns into chocolate.
[300:08.07]And he eats her?
[300:10.97]Catch two Charmallows.
[300:35.02]Okay, so then we gotta... It was just kind of chaos the last time I did this.
[300:43.56]I don't remember how to do any of this.
[300:49.25]Okay, where's the... I gotta bring you to cool him off.
[300:56.31]What are they like?
[300:59.47]They're obsessed with something.

[301:08.22]Okay, you love chocolate.
[301:09.30]Come over here.
[301:09.72]Wait, you have objects in mirror way closer than they appear.
[301:13.72]Never mind.
[301:16.78]Aren't there something over here?
[301:24.04]I swear there was one that was flying around here.
[301:29.28]Maybe not.
[301:38.48]I guess I'm going to have to lure that other one.
[301:39.64]I'm going to cover myself with chocolate and run around in a circle.
[301:41.92]This game gives you heartburn.
[301:45.44]This game makes me hungry.
[301:50.50]I need a popsicle.
[301:51.54]There we go.
[301:51.98]Alright, you follow me.
[301:52.90]Come on, popsicle.
[301:58.78]Now, chocolate is selected.
[302:01.52]He's very chocolatey.
[302:02.64]Take a look.
[302:05.60]Are you too high to understand this?
[302:11.57]Hey.
[302:11.75]Alright, come here.

[302:35.68]Pick him up.
[302:36.31]Pick him up.
[302:37.49]Why can't I pick him up?
[302:38.59]Is he okay?
[302:40.09]I can't pick him up.
[302:44.44]Oh dear, he's dead.
[302:47.80]Oh!
[302:58.77]Hello?
[303:07.77]Yeah, he's dead.
[303:09.17]He ain't getting up from that one.
[303:13.00]Sorry, Bobsicle.
[303:22.30]What do you mean I killed him?
[303:25.00]He jumped on the trampoline and killed himself.
[303:27.44]I didn't do anything.
[303:28.16]Alright, two Charmellas.
[303:43.56]Marshmallow nose.
[303:44.76]Oh, I like you.
[303:45.72]You're gonna look really goofy.
[303:48.80]A graham cracker head and a marshmallow nose.
[304:04.17]Snorpy's ready to go.
[304:05.59]We got two.
[304:06.59]Alright, dog.
[304:07.63]Let's do this.
[304:08.63]In just a moment, Chandler.
[304:11.55]You've been an invaluable ally.
[304:13.25]I'm even tempted to call you a friend, but quietly so I'm not overheard.
[304:16.71]Bro, if I didn't think it'd crush you like a tin can, I would hug the grump out of you.
[304:24.88]Oh, what the grump.
[304:26.50]Here it comes.
[304:27.58]These two are just, they want to hug.
[304:29.28]Expert hugging that is.
[304:31.00]You do that hug.
[304:33.87]Yeah, you're doing a real good job of hugging me.
[304:35.73]He did it.
[305:04.82]I think he's okay up there.
[305:05.98]Can I help him down?
[305:08.49]He doesn't know how to get down.
[305:14.63]He's like a cat in a tree.
[305:16.39]Fuck him.
[305:25.14]Okay.
[305:27.36]He hates those things.
[305:32.95]Alright, well come on, let's go.
[305:35.17]Let's go.
[305:35.57]Move.

[306:08.57]I saved him!
[306:11.93]See?
[306:12.47]Now he's like an orange creamsicle.
[306:17.17]He's fine.
[306:17.77]I thought he was gonna do it again.
[306:26.67]Is this annoying you?
[306:27.55]Is this annoying you?
[306:28.33]Is this annoying you?
[306:42.77]belong up there.
[306:51.12]Is that a crying face emoji?
[306:52.93]Alright, I got the bopsicles.
[307:13.49]You cannot reintegrate into society after being up there.
[307:18.11]Why?
[307:18.75]What?
[307:26.88]He's going good.
[307:29.18]No, no, no.
[307:29.92]Don't get distracted.
[307:31.82]First of all, I want to feed this potato to somebody and make them look weird.
[307:35.70]Not you.
[307:36.02]Yeah, we're almost done with making you look totally weird.
[307:41.07]Here, take another one of these spuds.

[309:39.29]Oh, he's recycling jokes.
[309:40.35]He's desperate.
[309:41.09]I'm desperate, man.
[309:51.04]Big beefy beer battered bong water wrapper barbecue burger.
[309:56.60]No, we're not doing this shit again.
[309:57.78]Just give me one more bobsicle and get me out of here.
[309:59.85]There's no Ruby Tuesdays in Vermont?
[310:16.43]Don't be sad about that.
[310:17.69]That place sucks.
[310:19.04]Don't, like, be annoyed by that.
[310:20.44]That's like, oh, no, too bad.
[310:21.64]I can't go to Ruby Tuesdays.
[310:23.54]That place is, like, not even good.

[311:18.96]But if I'm going to get a burger from a restaurant, I'm going to go to a restaurant that has good burgers.
[311:25.96]I know you go to Ruby Tuesdays for the burgers, but I don't know.
[311:28.08]I don't consider them to be that good.
[311:33.16]Oh, there's another Bobsicle down here.
[311:36.31]Not McDonald's.
[311:37.07]No, Ruby Tuesdays is better than McDonald's.
[311:40.49]Ruby Tuesdays is probably better than any fast food restaurant, I would say.
[311:43.71]Probably.
[311:45.05]But not by very much.
[311:47.74]Alright, I need a fire.
[311:48.90]Fire!
[311:52.67]You're new.
[311:53.41]Who are you?
[311:53.85]That's a rainbow sweetie fly.
[311:57.65]Ruby Tuesdays is for the salad, not the burgers.
[312:01.85]Somebody lied to you.
[312:05.06]Put him in the hot water?
[312:05.88]Come here.
[312:17.42]How come there's no, um, those flies anywhere?
[312:27.23]Hurry up!
[312:35.73]You like ketchup?
[312:39.99]Alright, he's, now I have to knock him out.
[312:46.11]Knock him out, knock him out, knock him out.
[312:53.89]Okay, I got it.
[312:54.95]I got a big box.
[312:59.55]A big... Okay, I need another one.
[313:04.42]That's a much better strategy.
[313:15.46]Wasn't there another one down here?
[313:18.30]Need another bobsicle, please.
[313:22.16]Alright, Morty, relax.
[313:25.00]Oh, man.
[313:40.15]You know, like, Rick and Morty is just, like, poison to you guys.
[313:48.86]Why?
[313:49.48]I'm trying to figure this out.
[313:52.62]Why is Rick and Morty just poison to your ears?
[313:57.28]What happened?
[313:58.90]Tell me.
[314:01.37]If I hear like, oh, Rick and Morty.
[314:07.13]It's because it has a Reddit fan base.
[314:09.19]Yeah, so does every fucking TV show, cartoon, video game.
[314:14.43]But our Smash Brothers, our Kid Icarus, our... Look, everything has a subreddit.
[314:20.15]What are you talking about?
[314:22.53]OurGerma985.
[314:25.47]OurFamilyGuy.
[314:26.41]OurAmericanDad.
[314:27.77]OurDexter.
[314:29.58]Shows that haven't been on the air for like five years, guys, still have Reddit fan bases that still stick around.
[314:40.75]Oh, there we go.
[314:42.47]Come here.
[314:46.97]Where's the other bobsicle?
[314:52.27]Whoever watches Dexter, omega LOL.
[314:54.15]No, the point is I haven't watched it in like 10 years.
[314:56.51]I need another bobsicle.
[315:03.87]At night time.
[315:05.67]Fine.
[315:08.54]Because of the sauce.
[315:09.62]What sauce?
[315:18.70]What the hell?
[315:19.16]Garfield?
[315:19.52]Garfield?
[315:24.10]Oh, I got... I need a bobsicle.
[315:44.81]Bob.
[315:47.13]Found a bobsicle.
[315:47.79]Bobsicle.
[315:47.97]Bobsicle.
[315:48.35]Bobsicle.
[315:48.87]Bobsicle.
[315:49.39]Bobsicle.
[315:49.99]Bobsicle.
[315:50.53]Bobsicle.
[315:51.03]Bobsicle.
[315:52.90]Alright, knock him out.
[315:54.10]Knock him out!
[315:54.80]Into the tree, what the fuck?
[315:56.40]You alright?
[315:57.28]Oh shit, he exploded.
[316:22.10]Oops.
[316:22.70]No, I need you to be big.
[316:23.80]Can you guys combine?
[316:34.40]Give me my sauce.
[316:35.56]What sauce are you talking about?
[316:55.36]I need another bobsicle.
[316:58.23]Give me the McDonald's sauce.
[316:59.49]Oh, give me my sauce.
[317:00.59]Okay, I see what you're doing.
[317:02.79]Give me my sauce.
[317:10.51]Give me my sauce.
[317:12.62]What the fuck is that thing?
[317:16.64]Hey!
[317:18.52]Why didn't I take a picture of it?
[317:19.44]I should've just taken a picture of it.
[317:25.55]I was frozen in fear.
[317:38.42]What happened?
[317:39.04]What was that?
[317:47.59]Oh, I know what happened to Liz.
[317:49.09]That's her.
[317:49.81]That's Liz.
[317:50.67]I get it.
[317:51.63]Okay, so they're like, yeah, she ate a ton of these and became that.
[317:54.49]I get it.
[317:55.51]I understand the game now.
[318:01.95]Still need a bobsicle, though.
[318:05.40]And we are all becoming that by eating the bobsicles too much.
[318:11.96]I see.
[318:12.26]Because we're slowly all going to turn into that kind of shit.
[318:16.83]I see.
[318:17.29]Alright.
[318:17.79]It's just like that story of the chocolate.
[318:19.45]The kid that could eat anything that would become chocolate in his mouth.
[318:26.22]Give me a bobsicle, please, God.
[318:27.60]Before I freak out.
[318:30.14]I can't believe I didn't get a picture of it.
[318:37.16]That's so sad.
[318:37.84]I didn't get a photo.
[318:38.98]I'm just sitting there staring into nothing.
[318:43.53]Leave the area?
[318:44.17]Yeah.
[318:51.61]Augustus Gloop.
[318:52.55]Augustus Gloop.
[318:53.81]Augustus Gloop.
[318:59.09]End of the stream, voice?
[318:59.96]Probably soon.
[319:03.28]After I do these quests, probably.
[319:14.23]Oh, I don't know the lyrics.
[319:18.06]Every song in the remake of Willy Wonka was just, it said the character's name like three or four times to a catchy beat.
[319:25.53]Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka, the famous chocolatier.
[319:29.69]Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop, he did something, he did this.
[319:37.23]Elvira, Elvira, Elvira, you're in trouble.
[319:40.44]I hear a bobsicle, yes I do.
[320:04.58]He didn't get put out?
[320:05.44]Alright, Bobsicle's my favorite character so far.
[320:09.00]I want a good photo.
[320:16.43]Look at me!
[320:18.58]Look at me.
[320:19.02]Hey.
[320:24.41]He didn't even care.
[320:25.29]Get over here.
[320:25.79]Alright, he's been out.
[320:33.13]Flip him over.
[320:36.69]Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
[320:38.13]Get angry.
[320:40.09]Get angry.
[320:41.65]Get angry.
[320:42.35]Let's go.
[320:51.15]I got two crunchy bags.
[320:54.11]What am I going to get?
[320:55.67]I need food.
[320:56.43]What is it going to be?
[320:58.70]Bacon Bongo Burger?
[321:00.74]Maybe.
[321:00.88]Why are you not getting the new sauce?
[321:10.96]I don't know.
[321:14.12]Plan on it.
[321:22.22]Taco sauce?
[321:30.26]Wendy has that pretzel burger.
[321:31.56]That's true.
[321:33.06]I wanted to try that for a while, though.
[321:39.17]One of you guys told me that it wasn't that good, though.
[321:43.35]Somebody said it was okay.
[321:44.61]It wasn't that great.
[321:45.45]So, I don't know.
[321:47.17]Is it any good?
[321:51.88]Alright, big bobsicle feet.
[321:53.44]Big bobsicle feet.
[321:55.80]Now you can walk on acid.
[321:58.20]And fire.
[321:58.50]Pretzel burger is good, but if you burp after, you will fucking die.
[322:02.88]It makes me not want to eat it.
[322:25.25]I know what you mean by that and that scares me What does that mean that I am when in my mind I assume that you didn't even fix the bridge you didn't do anything What?
[322:55.09]Okay, if after you eat like a bunch of cheese and pretzel and bacon and pub cheese I can imagine the burps would come up and It would be they would number one they would stink right like don't let's be real would be realistic with ourselves You probably smell horrible, and it would probably burn to like a little painful and like acidy Hurt your throat too.
[323:20.96]Yeah, probably
[323:25.02]What the fuck is pub cheese?
[323:26.32]You know, I don't know what it is.
[323:29.96]It's this orange spreadable cream cheese shit that has this odd taste to it.
[323:37.24]What is pub cheese?
[323:38.38]It's cheese and alcohol.
[323:51.81]Cheese from beer?
[323:52.95]No, I don't think it is.
[323:58.95]Pub cheese is human vomit.
[324:00.70]That's... Gross.
[324:03.90]It's beer cheese?
[324:05.38]Hold on.
[324:05.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[324:06.20]I need to look at this.
[324:07.60]I'm gonna wrap it up here, by the way.
[324:09.69]Pub cheese.
[324:10.37]I'm just curious what this is.
[324:12.15]Okay.
[324:15.79]What is pub cheese?
[324:22.06]Pub cheese is a type of soft cheese spread and dip prepared using cheese as a primary ingredient and usually with some type of beer or ale.
[324:30.64]So you were right.
[324:31.30]Okay, it's beer cheese.
[324:33.52]I've had pub cheese a bunch of times before.
[324:36.10]I've had specifically beer cheese before and beer cheese to me is way better.
[324:42.70]Pub cheese doesn't taste like beer cheese to me for some reason.
[324:45.50]I don't...
[324:51.55]I know everything about Wendy's.
[324:54.39]Well, that's interesting because your name is McGriddle Tony.
[324:59.53]You seem to be dabbling in the competition as well, Tony.
[325:05.03]Yes, you're a traitor.
[325:05.87]That's what you are.
[325:13.14]That's a great name, though.
[325:14.40]McGriddle Tony.
[325:16.72]I know everything about Wendy's.
[325:21.91]But here's the thing.
[325:22.71]You might know everything about everything.
[325:24.47]About all the fast food places.
[325:25.53]And the McRiddle might just be your favorite.
[325:27.16]So, okay.
[325:28.02]I think I get it.
[325:35.76]It is a good name.
[325:36.88]It really is.
[325:37.38]I haven't had a McRiddle in so long.
[325:46.09]Do they still make them?
[325:47.09]It's like two little pancakes with the bacon, egg, and cheese in the middle.
[325:51.39]They're actually really good.
[325:59.02]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[326:04.46]Tomorrow or Monday?
[326:05.38]Let's see.
[326:05.78]Maybe Monday, Tuesday.
[326:08.23]Check the sus.
[326:08.75]Probably tomorrow.
[326:09.17]I'll see you tomorrow.
[326:11.05]If for some reason I don't stream tomorrow, I'll stream Monday.
[326:13.17]But the plan on tomorrow.
[326:15.39]Starting around probably the same time.
[326:16.37]Somewhere around 2.
[326:16.79]Thanks for watching.
[326:20.62]This has been Bugsnax.
[326:21.78]I don't... I may or may not play this again tomorrow.
[326:25.28]I'm kind of invested.
[326:32.28]We'll see.
[326:35.55]I'll see you guys tomorrow, regardless of whatever we do.
[326:38.81]Take care of yourselves.
[326:39.44]Let's go, let's take a look at the credits.
[326:40.58]Here are all the wonderful subs, subscriptions, multi-month, multi-year subscriptions.
[326:48.00]Thanks, guys.
[326:50.30]I had fun.
[326:50.64]I think it's a good game.
[326:57.09]Uh, WTR6K4DA gave 20 community subs.
[327:01.65]We caught that, but we did not see the 100 fucking dollars.
[327:09.83]That they also gave.
[327:10.73]They said, Thanks for all the laughs of the years, Jeremy.
[327:14.03]Your content is really uplifting.
[327:15.41]Also, game sucks.
[327:18.63]With a Santa Kappa.
[327:22.13]Game sucks.
[327:24.94]I don't think the game sucks.
[327:25.90]I think the game is pretty cool, actually.
[327:30.76]Game does not suck.
[327:37.42]I want to see the ending.
[327:39.92]Out of two.
[327:40.60]We're going to play this tomorrow.
[327:41.64]We'll play tomorrow.
[327:43.96]I want to complete Bugsnax.
[327:45.13]Alright.
[327:49.89]I'm getting a little tight, so I got to get up.
[327:54.79]I will see you guys tomorrow for Bugsnax two.
[327:59.78]Have a great rest of your night.
[328:01.56]Take care, guys.
