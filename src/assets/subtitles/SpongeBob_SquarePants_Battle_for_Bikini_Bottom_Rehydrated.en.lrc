[00:01.44]Sorry, dude.
[00:01.86]I forgot to press the button that says to talk.
[00:05.90]No, I know.
[00:06.46]I can't even have two minutes.
[00:09.80]I can't even have two minutes to myself.
[00:13.46]I can't have two minutes to myself.
[00:15.79]I turn the stream on and I'm just sitting here just looking at Spongebob.
[00:22.17]This is our time.
[00:25.67]You had a whole day to yourself.
[00:29.89]You're ours now.
[00:33.55]His mic is wicked fucked up.
[00:36.27]I tried to fix it.
[00:36.97]I tried to make it louder.
[00:41.77]Did I not succeed in making the mic louder?
[00:49.38]Am I loud now?
[00:50.20]You've got two months to yourself, Omega Lul.
[01:03.34]And do that again.
[01:03.92]That's how you know I'm at 61%!
[01:06.20]Probably shouldn't do that, though.
[01:10.54]I'm gonna have to take another fucking three months off.
[01:17.64]That's your... That's how you prove it?
[01:21.36]That's how you tell people that you're feeling a little better?
[01:23.90]Is the amount of times that you can... How many octaves and... You can go up or down.
[01:30.64]Alright, we're going to play SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated.
[01:35.18]I was going to play the original on the PS3, PS2.
[01:41.28]But months and months and months ago, I was told, don't do that.
[01:45.52]They're making a new one.
[01:46.95]They're redoing the whole game.
[01:48.31]Just wait.
[01:49.49]So I just waited, and here it is.
[01:53.57]I've never played this.
[01:56.59]I'm a huge fan of SpongeBob.
[01:58.25]I've seen...
[02:00.50]Like, the first 12 episodes, and then I just stopped.
[02:03.24]I'm a huge fan.
[02:07.24]That's not even fucking true.
[02:12.58]I think I've seen all the Spongebob episodes.
[02:15.86]Up until... I don't know, like, maybe after the fourth, fifth, sixth season?
[02:23.64]Season 7?
[02:25.05]How many actual new episodes?
[02:26.47]Hit the thing about Spongebob that's hard for me to understand.
[02:29.25]So, does Spongebob keep having new episodes or do they keep replaying old ones?
[02:34.70]Sometimes it's hard to tell.
[02:37.22]There's 13 seasons.
[02:37.98]Okay.
[02:41.71]Seasons 1 through 3 are the good ones.
[02:45.38]Yeah, I know, but I can't... I'm not gonna lie to you.
[02:48.46]I've definitely laughed and, like, giggled at, like, probably, like, season 8, like, episode 10, you know?
[02:54.98]I have.
[02:55.26]Yeah, they made a movie, too.
[03:01.06]Alright, let me tweet this.
[03:01.79]Just give me one second.
[03:19.75]Hold on, this is on my Twitter.
[03:24.75]This is the first thing that's on my list.
[03:27.81]Okay, this is... This is a render of me singing this song in the game.
[03:34.55]Why is this the first thing in my feed?
[03:35.87]Alright, well that was cool.
[03:41.61]Alright, um... Let me tweet this.
[03:55.39]This is freaking me out.
[03:56.15]Why is it so good?
[03:59.65]That's me doing that, but it's a render of me on another character.
[04:05.57]Was I deepfaked onto a video game character?
[04:08.56]You can do that?
[04:10.68]You can be deepfaked onto a new video game?
[04:14.80]I thought it had to be like a human face, like a photo or something, or like an actual video of a person.
[04:20.22]Holy sh- Alright.
[04:23.32]Get this started.
[04:23.88]Let me tweet this.
[04:26.88]In the meantime, you guys can take a look at Spongebob doing the fucking gerbil walk.
[04:36.24]That's what he's doing, right?
[04:38.85]Give me one second.
[04:40.33]Spongebob.
[04:42.13]People probably think I'm watching Spongebob.
[04:43.69]What if I wrote, watching favorite Spongebob episodes?
[04:47.43]And then the guy, he doesn't know.
[04:52.04]I'm in a wicked fucked up mood today.
[04:53.20]This is going to be a weird one.
[04:56.00]I can already tell.
[05:01.43]No, not Jerma975.
[05:02.39]Who the fuck is that?
[05:09.06]Alright, can I... Why would you make that name?
[05:13.20]Are you gonna start a streaming career as like Jerma785?
[05:16.72]Like, I'm Jerma985.
[05:17.36]Are you gonna be Jerma895?
[05:21.16]What do you think is gonna happen?
[05:32.21]I'm the only Jerma985.
[05:33.83]I'm the only Jerma with any three series of numbers after his name.
[05:37.78]Alright, let's go.
[05:50.75]Wait, I have a controller.
[05:51.65]Yeah, I do.
[05:52.51]So is this game any good?
[05:53.69]Is this actually like a fun game?
[05:58.65]Here's where I'm concerned.
[05:59.49]Is this a Simpsons hit and run kind of game?
[06:04.64]No.
[06:08.79]Okay.
[06:09.49]Let's check it out.
[06:10.09]I'm ready.
[06:14.62]Welcome to Bikini Bottom, a normally peaceful undersea sanctuary.
[06:19.68]It's like its own episode.
[06:21.10]Transformed into a theater of pure horror, wherein our little yellow friend will play the starring role.
[06:27.89]Today is the big day.
[06:32.79]I have devised an ingenious plan to finally steal the Krabby Patty formula.
[06:38.17]I think he's going to do it this time.
[06:39.27]If Bikini Bottom happens to get demolished in the process, oh well.
[06:46.06]With my brand new... I've known an army of robots that will wreak mayhem and destruction at my command!
[06:57.86]One last review of the checklist.
[07:00.28]Let's see.
[07:01.70]Item number one.
[07:03.22]Is Plankton a genius?
[07:05.38]Answer, yes.
[07:06.70]Okay, checklist complete.
[07:08.24]Throw in the switch.
[07:10.24]I think that's just a game.
[07:12.68]Welcome, my perfectly obedient robot army.
[07:15.97]Hang on.
[07:16.97]I want to get a photo for my scrapbook.
[07:19.61]Hey, hello?
[07:22.13]What do you think you're doing?
[07:26.60]I'm seeing that in real time too.
[07:27.78]That's not you seeing that on stream.
[07:29.26]I'm seeing that too.
[07:47.98]Another perfect day playing robots and racehorses.
[07:51.78]Yeah, only I keep getting the racehorses and the robots mixed up.
[07:56.51]Wait, do I have like the Spanish animation and the English dub?
[08:01.06]Do I have this wrong?
[08:02.00]No, this is right.
[08:02.82]I won't do it.
[08:03.58]I'm not going to do it.
[08:05.18]I can't.
[08:05.80]Yeah, it's fine.
[08:31.34]Okay.
[08:33.44]I didn't even do it.
[08:34.38]Why is everybody minus?
[08:35.31]I didn't do anything.
[08:36.17]I told you I wasn't going to do it because I didn't want to offend everybody in this room.
[08:40.93]It's quite a big room.
[08:43.17]Shut up.
[08:43.53]Alright.
[08:43.89]Oh my god.
[08:44.82]But Patrick, aren't we going to say the magic wishing words?
[08:49.18]You already did.
[08:51.18]So, okay is the magic wishing word?
[08:54.17]It used to be... But I kept forgetting it.
[09:02.22]Are you sure this will work?
[09:04.06]Sure.
[09:05.44]Last week, I only had one big cookie crumb and I was really hungry.
[09:09.98]So I put my cookie crumb in the magic wishing shell.
[09:13.42]This is like Patrick accidentally makes meth?
[09:15.73]What is this episode?
[09:16.63]And in the morning, I had lots of little cookie crumbs.
[09:20.07]Patrick, I proclaim that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.
[09:24.97]Good night, SpongeBob.
[09:26.11]Good night, Patrick.
[09:28.89]The next melting pot.
[09:30.73]Is this in blood?
[09:34.17]The bikini bottom stinks.
[09:49.69]Yeah, Gary.
[09:50.73]It sure looks like we're in a doozy of a pickle.
[09:53.71]I think I'm gonna have to learn a lot in order to fix this mess.
[09:57.17]Did Patrick, like, breathe in the shit in the shell and go in, like, a drug craze and destroy the place?
[10:09.29]That is what happened.
[10:10.09]Is that actually what happened?
[10:12.30]Why are people saying that's what happened?
[10:13.90]Yes, Jeremy, that's what happened.
[10:23.02]I think... I can't just read this normally.
[10:27.94]I can't.
[10:28.58]Alright.
[10:29.08]Everybody fucking leave if you don't like it.
[10:30.70]Whatever.
[10:30.96]I don't care.
[10:33.36]I think I'm going to have to learn a lot in order to fix this mess.
[10:37.59]Meow.
[10:39.01]Meow.
[10:39.43]Oh, he already read it.
[10:41.41]He already read it.
[10:42.17]Why did I read it after him?
[10:53.09]Why did I not process that he's, the whole thing is voice acted?
[10:56.37]What am I, stupid?
[10:57.43]Okay.
[11:00.45]Um, how do I read the signs?
[11:02.47]Oh, okay.
[11:10.11]Press this button to read the signs.
[11:11.89]Right bumper to read the signs.
[11:12.89]You got it.
[11:15.16]So if I want to come back and talk to you again, just walk up to you and press this button.
[11:20.36]I'd better get started now, Gary.
[11:21.74]I think that this is going to be a very long day.
[11:24.96]Okay.
[11:26.70]So you talk with Arby.
[11:29.71]Explore the kitchen.
[11:30.83]What's all this stuff?
[11:32.07]Explore the bedroom.
[11:33.39]And explore the attic.
[11:34.79]Explore the closet.
[11:38.23]Okay, pretty fluid.
[11:42.64]This actually looks really good.
[11:49.41]This is really, really nice looking, isn't it?
[11:51.63]Okay, let's explore.
[11:54.54]We need 50... Whatever those are.
[12:00.59]These are shiny objects.
[12:01.81]Shiny objects are very valuable and may be traded to help Spongebob Goliath.
[12:04.77]This is a currency.
[12:06.46]Spongebob will need to collect as many shiny objects in order to complete his quest to defeat the robot menace.
[12:11.64]There are five different hundred... There are a hundred different community subs that just came in from Freddy Dread.
[12:18.84]Another of, like, added to the thousands that Freddy Dread has given.
[12:22.16]That's fucking insane.
[12:23.84]Thank you for the hundred community subs.
[12:26.63]Jesus.
[12:29.17]Freddy.
[12:33.35]Thank you, Freddy.
[12:34.33]Jesus.
[12:35.51]Freddy again.
[12:36.09]Freddy every day.
[12:37.43]Freddy every moment.
[12:41.95]I need to open up my Twitch analytics and look at total amount of money contributions and just see, oh, here's the percent from Freddy.
[12:49.14]It's probably like 13% by now.
[12:50.14]Like 20%.
[12:50.44]Thank you, dude.
[12:51.10]Seriously.
[12:51.42]Anyways, there are five colors.
[12:55.96]It's him.
[13:03.80]Freddy, yeah, it's Freddy Dredd.
[13:05.28]You don't know who the fuck that is?
[13:06.41]Okay, go look him up.
[13:12.05]There are five different colors.
[13:13.61]Red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
[13:15.77]There are five different colors.
[13:17.73]Okay, red, yellow, green, camera TV, you know?
[13:24.98]And then you do it again.
[13:26.68]Red is the most common and the least valuable.
[13:29.26]Purple is the most rare and therefore the most valuable.
[13:34.22]Oh, get over it!
[13:40.66]I was- What?
[13:42.08]That wasn't what you- Oh, you know, I can't do that?
[13:43.94]I said the words camera and TV, alright?
[13:52.33]What?
[13:52.85]I can't say camera and TV in the same sentence with just five things to remember?
[13:59.91]I know from Mr. Krabs that it even smells sweaty.
[14:03.37]That's gross.
[14:04.03]How the fuck does that happen?
[14:05.13]Ahoy there, SpongeBob.
[14:07.05]As a faithful crew member of the Krusty Krab, you've been, er, promoted to Head Shiny Object Collector.
[14:18.46]Yeah, that's a different actor.
[14:19.36]It wasn't available?
[14:21.66]Wow!
[14:22.62]A promotion!
[14:25.09]That's right.
[14:25.85]A promotion.
[14:27.07]So what this here new job entails is you collecting all these shiny objects that the robots are leaving behind and bringing them to me.
[14:35.41]Now stop seahorsing around and get busy collecting.
[14:41.07]That's right.
[14:41.47]No, I'm not going to try.
[14:43.19]I need like another year to figure that out.
[14:44.44]The robots are the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:54.28]I love this.
[14:55.50]This is so fun.
[14:56.30]I haven't even done anything.
[14:58.40]Alright, so let me see the rarity.
[15:02.15]Red, yellow, green, blue, purple.
[15:04.31]Red is the most common.
[15:05.23]Purple is the most valuable, so that's what I'm looking for, is purple.
[15:15.50]You better do SpongeBob voices.
[15:18.42]Did you really think you were going to come to the stream and you're not going to hear at least four times?
[15:22.76]It's already happened twice.
[15:24.84]I don't know, I thought that she said Spongebob can see through walls.
[15:28.02]Spongebob can see through walls.
[15:29.58]I was like, wait, how?
[15:30.56]Is this Hitman?
[15:32.16]Alright, Spongebob might see how well he's doing by pressing RT.
[15:36.73]Zixi 100 community subs.
[15:38.37]You guys, it took two fucking streams with like 3,000 subs to get just jumped back on here.
[15:46.23]I can't even fucking believe it.
[15:49.66]Thank you.
[15:49.98]It's insane to me.
[15:51.28]It's insane that you guys would even remotely, like, have that many people come back and sub it or community sub.
[15:56.56]It's crazy.
[15:57.38]I can't even believe it.
[16:00.72]Spongebob, let me see how well he's doing by pressing RT.
[16:03.28]Thank you, Zixia.
[16:04.02]Seriously.
[16:05.18]So many people gave money last time.
[16:06.50]I was just kind of overwhelmed and trying to ease back into it.
[16:08.56]And if you don't know, I'm no longer doing bit readings.
[16:13.64]It's a whole thing.
[16:15.08]I'll go over it again later on.
[16:16.32]We'll talk about it again if you don't know.
[16:19.82]You operate as how many shiny objects you have.
[16:21.42]Is it like a currency?
[16:22.40]Don't say that.
[16:22.96]That's an easy joke.
[16:24.34]Golden spatulas.
[16:27.38]Is this kind of like puzzle pieces in Banjo?
[16:29.87]Like stars in Mario?
[16:32.61]Patrick's lost socks.
[16:35.45]Here's an underwear SpongeBob has.
[16:39.05]Cool, alright.
[16:42.21]Okay.
[16:42.73]I make myself a snack.
[16:44.19]But there's no time!
[16:48.47]Alright, what's the last room I have to go into?
[16:50.59]I need more shiny objects.
[16:51.93]Oh, I can move the camera.
[16:55.57]This bathroom?
[16:56.99]The attic.
[16:57.41]How do I get to the attic?
[16:59.14]I'm blind.
[17:02.52]Hold on, I gotta get all the shiny objects!
[17:04.24]Oh, there's a double jump.
[17:07.40]This game just became ten times more cool.
[17:13.22]I don't wanna miss these.
[17:18.87]This is a classic collect-a-thon.
[17:20.85]Oh, don't get me in this one.
[17:24.05]I don't think I'll ever get out.
[17:26.21]Wait, what is this?
[17:28.33]Oh, whoa!
[17:30.17]Oh, I see.
[17:30.63]Alright, this is the bedroom.
[17:35.05]I thought of... Ooh, alright, here's underwear.
[17:36.89]How do I pick it up?
[17:38.11]Wait, is underwear health?
[17:43.05]Can I open this?
[17:49.40]It is.
[17:49.74]Wow.
[17:52.04]AA.
[17:52.60]Uh-huh.
[17:53.70]Double jump for extra height.
[17:54.69]SpongeBob can only double jump once per jump.
[17:56.39]Uh-huh.
[18:01.87]Oh, cool.
[18:02.45]Is there any... I was going to call them crusties.
[18:10.01]Oh, shit.
[18:10.37]There's a lot of tutorials in here.
[18:12.31]To see how well SpongeBob is doing in every level of the game, press... No!
[18:16.73]I got...
[18:17.94]the fuck Xbox like whatever happened to the original start why what's with like the fucking menu button thing like I always forget where that is I always forget if it's uh selector start it's been the same thing for like 20 30 straight years and you had to just put the weird like top left iPad friendly menu button that's on every website like just make it the start button well who why change that I don't understand I don't get it I always forget if that's selector start
[18:46.97]When a level is selected, press A to view its details.
[18:48.98]So, okay, you can see how much you've collected.
[18:54.14]Yeah?
[18:55.02]There's a hint on each golden spatula.
[18:57.58]Mmm!
[18:59.46]SpongeBob can take a taxi directly to the area of that spatula from anywhere in the game.
[19:04.18]Holy shit, that's so good.
[19:05.72]How many areas are in this game?
[19:12.57]SpongeBob's... Wait, did I just take a taxi to my closet?
[19:24.01]I was gonna say, what the hell does that mean?
[19:25.49]I... I get a beach ball?
[19:26.01]Oh, cool.
[19:26.17]I haven't even played the game yet and I'm just having fun.
[19:30.29]This is fun.
[19:55.55]Can I run on it?
[19:56.05]I've got to believe I can run on it.
[19:58.91]What do the Tiki's do?
[20:09.50]Just extra... I've got to think of something to call these because I'll forget it every time.
[20:15.74]Press B and he'll do a bubble bounce attack.
[20:18.08]Okay.
[20:22.43]That's just like a ground pound.
[20:28.50]Yeah, B. Grampoline.
[20:31.96]Okay.
[20:33.94]Cool.
[20:36.56]So what does the attack button do?
[20:37.58]Can I just catch stuff?
[20:44.27]This is going to turn into like Luigi's Mansion where I told you I couldn't play Luigi's Mansion 3 on stream.
[20:51.41]You guys know why, right?
[20:55.75]Oh, here's the bubble spin.
[20:56.57]Okay.
[21:01.34]Someone's asking me why.
[21:02.18]Because I couldn't... I had to suck up every single object in every room.
[21:07.06]I couldn't even play it.
[21:07.90]I had to stop playing it.
[21:10.47]I got to, like, the first little boss encounter, and it was, like, three or four hours had gone by, and I'm just like, I have to stop this.
[21:16.39]I have to stop playing this.
[21:17.17]It's driving me fucking crazy.
[21:20.11]Hold on, let me see.
[21:21.85]Okay, right.
[21:22.63]Oh, you can push buttons on walls.
[21:26.72]Why was I pretending that that was new information?
[21:30.56]Okay, you can jump and do it in midair.
[21:37.03]Alright, cool.
[21:39.23]But yeah, if I have to just collect every single item... Wait.
[21:43.53]Now I... Oh, man.
[21:44.81]This is not gonna go well.
[21:49.09]I'm gonna be stuck here for life.
[21:57.46]Shit.
[21:58.00]Okay, I gotta get that dirty sock.
[22:01.14]Give me that beach ball.
[22:09.67]Hey!
[22:10.79]What the hell was that?
[22:11.55]I need to get that!
[22:19.23]Wait, can I just push it?
[22:22.44]Oh.
[22:25.36]Wait.
[22:27.04]Why am I trying to...
[22:31.45]Oh, here comes some hustle platforming.
[22:35.81]25 seconds left.
[22:37.65]23 seconds left.
[22:38.61]22.
[22:38.63]21.
[22:38.67]Do they get a head start?
[22:43.14]What the fuck?
[22:50.96]I thought I was looking at...
[22:59.40]I hate that I wasn't gonna get there.
[23:06.10]And that's one dirty sock.
[23:09.54]Room complete.
[23:16.43]Yeah, you can take a 10 second head start, that's fine.
[23:18.13]Alright, now it's 50 to go in there.
[23:26.54]I have 50, right?
[23:27.02]Yeah.
[23:27.18]Alright, let's go.
[23:28.26]This room's expensive.
[23:31.88]Ooh, there's a golden spatula.
[23:36.69]What about the legendary chest?
[23:38.61]Hold on.
[23:40.13]This is a golden spatula.
[23:42.07]Okay.
[23:54.46]Wait, go back and look at the chest, somebody said.
[23:56.14]Read the sign next to the chest.
[23:57.21]Wait, what?
[23:57.55]This is underwear.
[23:58.93]Like this.
[23:59.15]When he's lost all of his underwear, he must start that area back over again.
[24:03.49]Yes.
[24:18.64]SpongeBob may get back underwear he has lost by collecting additional pairs along the way.
[24:24.05]SpongeBob starts out wearing three pairs of underwear, but there are special pairs of golden underwear hidden in Bikini Bottom.
[24:30.01]Which, if you find them, they'll allow SpongeBob to wear more than three pairs of underwear at a time.
[24:36.20]Ugh.
[24:38.30]SpongeBob can check how many pairs of underwear he has on.
[24:41.30]Pressing right trigger.
[24:45.16]Fresh like a spring breeze.
[24:49.45]SpongeBob has no underwear on.
[24:51.07]Alright, let's go.
[24:54.06]I got the spatula.
[24:55.20]Look, I'm not looking for 100%.
[24:56.38]I'm just looking for, like, somewhere around 80.
[24:57.84]What about the TV?
[25:04.64]Breaking news!
[25:06.08]Bikini Bottom residents have been attacked by a raging torrent of robot horror!
[25:11.88]So much for fixing this quietly.
[25:13.76]Yeah.
[25:15.90]Authorities are not sure who is responsible for unleashing the mechanical menaces, but they have assured us that the person is in big, big trouble.
[25:24.48]Uh-oh.
[25:26.40]Did I say big trouble?
[25:28.26]I meant so enormous that it's hard to comprehend trouble.
[25:31.84]We'll keep you posted as this tragic story unfolds.
[25:35.62]Tragically, we're sure.
[25:37.32]Oh no.
[25:40.72]I'm in big trouble.
[25:48.11]This is a +2 game.
[25:50.13]Yeah, it's Spongebob.
[25:51.08]There's nothing like the sounds of your own neighborhood.
[25:55.94]Oh, shit.
[25:56.66]Open world?
[25:57.50]Spongebob, you're polluting my thinking space.
[26:01.02]Trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula again, eh, Plankton?
[26:04.84]Well, you won't get away with it.
[26:07.68]I've got bigger fish to fry.
[26:09.28]I've got to figure out how to regain control of the Chum Bucket from those robots.
[26:14.10]Crush him?
[26:15.06]Where did they come from?
[26:17.86]He's a liar.
[26:19.22]He did it.
[26:19.82]It was him.
[26:20.04]I know it.
[26:20.32]It's him in every episode.
[26:41.77]Won't you help me stop them?
[26:43.81]Before they bend all my forks?
[26:47.32]Not the forks!
[26:48.96]Of course I'll help!
[26:50.52]But wait, I'm supposed to collect a whole lot of golden spatulas!
[26:53.56]Golden spatulas, SpongeBob?
[26:56.16]That sounds like something I'd be interested in!
[26:59.11]Golden spatulas, eh?
[27:01.47]SpongeBob, if you can get me back into the Chum Bucket, I'll give you a bucket full of golden spatulas!
[27:07.37]In your dreams.
[27:17.32]Stop it!
[27:20.90]Oh my god, that was fucking so funny, Jerma.
[27:22.66]I laughed wicked fucking hard.
[27:24.90]Alright, so, taxi.
[27:27.66]So, let's... Can I just go anywhere?
[27:29.74]I need five to go this way.
[27:33.85]I need more gold and spatulas to unlock downtown Bikini Bottom.
[27:46.01]Should I just do what happens in every SpongeBob episode?
[27:48.63]Like throw rocks at Squidward's house?
[27:55.47]Where are they?
[27:59.91]SpongeBob, this flapping robot crisis is making the Krusty Krab lose money like a sinking ship.
[28:05.81]No money means no more Krusty Krab.
[28:08.69]No more Krusty Krab means no more fry cooking for you.
[28:13.36]It's imitation crabs.
[28:15.38]Imitation crab.
[28:16.62]Ah, that was pretty good.
[28:18.56]That was pretty good.
[28:21.99]No more fry cooking?
[28:24.91]But because you're gullible, I'm gonna help you out.
[28:27.85]And of course make a small profit in return.
[28:30.62]I've got a few golden spatulas that I'll be willing to trade to you for some of those shiny objects.
[28:37.12]But because you're gullible, I'm going to help you out, boy, and of course make a small profit.
[28:42.87]His voice is un... You can't mimic it.
[28:44.83]You can't.
[28:47.51]Alex Jones.
[28:58.24]I got a few, uh, golden spatulas that'll be willing to trade you for some of those shiny objects and... Well, I love Spongebob, I just, you know, I wish, the problem is you just, you... I'm not getting any more money on this, and I gotta make money to make money, you know what I mean?
[29:20.85]I mean, but don't you think that Alex Jones would be able to do a better Mr. Krabs?
[29:24.55]Like, if it was just Alex Jones talking, it would be closer, wouldn't it?
[29:31.20]No.
[29:33.14]If Alex Jones, yes, somebody said it.
[29:43.22]If Alex Jones did his best pirate impression, it might be kind of close.
[29:48.38]It could be.
[29:50.82]You've never heard Alex Jones' Mr. Krabs impression.
[29:54.14]Neither have I.
[29:56.04]You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves if you're going to journey to the ninth dimension and defeat the giant monkey man.
[30:09.67]You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves.
[30:13.65]All I need to do is figure out how to get rid of these robots.
[30:19.15]Do you really want...
[30:33.21]Oh, what the fuck?
[30:34.79]Alright, now you're throwing me off.
[30:38.31]I'm not on crack.
[30:51.45]Alright?
[30:51.81]I'm on a different- I'm on some- I'm on a different drug.
[30:55.23]I already know.
[30:55.59]The sign told me this already.
[30:56.53]Mega combo?
[30:57.07]Wait, why is this attacking me?
[31:17.38]It's on absent.
[31:18.18]Should I try this one?
[31:19.14]No.
[31:19.22]What about the robot parts?
[31:19.96]Anything with those?
[31:20.58]Hey.
[31:20.70]Hey!
[31:20.78]Hey!
[31:55.24]Oh, that just, okay, that freaked me the fuck out.
[31:59.08]That was so out of place that I thought something was wrong.
[32:06.65]I don't know why, that was so out of place that I felt like somebody was in the room with me here.
[32:12.11]And did that from behind the monitor.
[32:17.79]Alright, so where do I go?
[32:18.67]Where should I go?
[32:19.75]Should I go to Squidward's house?
[32:25.44]Ooh, golden undies!
[32:27.44]Oh, shit.
[32:27.86]What did that do?
[32:28.86]How do I get there?
[32:29.54]On this side?

[33:45.50]Oh, I correct myself.
[33:46.64]That whole robot problem involved both of you.
[33:50.29]This whole stream is going to be that, and I'm sorry.
[33:51.87]There's like 8,000 people here, and I think a lot of you might not have been to the stream maybe before.
[33:56.97]That's what this is.
[33:57.55]That's the whole thing.
[33:59.70]I don't know either.
[34:00.44]I know what you just said out loud.

[34:11.34]Squidward, I don't know what to do.
[34:13.51]How can I fix everything?
[34:14.85]Why don't you move to another town?
[34:17.53]That should help out more than enough.
[34:20.82]Guys, what are you talking about?

[35:22.04]Alright, can I, is he Squirrely?
[35:33.53]His name's not Squirred, it's Squidward.
[35:36.25]He only has one room, I thought he has a bathtub upstairs.
[35:39.48]He can't go in his upstairs bathtub thing?

[36:14.47]The one you're standing on.
[36:16.58]Oh, that one.
[36:17.68]It's lost.
[36:36.59]Well, if that one's lost, where are your other socks?
[36:40.52]Well, they're more lost.
[36:42.12]A bunch of robots came through here and stole my whole sock collection.
[36:46.26]I could use some help getting them back.
[36:48.49]Sure thing, Patrick.
[36:49.75]What are best friends for?
[36:51.53]Okay, then.
[36:52.43]For every ten socks you bring back to me, I'll give you a golden turkey baster.
[36:58.45]You mean spatula?
[37:00.76]Bless you.
[37:04.55]So this is the red coins of SpongeBob.
[37:13.22]Does he have anything?
[37:14.64]Holy shit, SpongeBob, really?
[37:24.16]You're going to break into your buddy's house who owns a sofa and not even a carpet or anything.
[37:31.45]And that's what you're going to do?
[37:32.17]Take his stuff?
[37:32.69]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[37:37.15]Is this?
[37:38.51]Wait.
[37:41.78]And I'm going to destroy his sofa.
[37:43.28]That's good.
[37:45.94]You're the one controlling him.
[37:49.76]So...
[37:56.62]What?
[37:57.26]Why is everybody freaking out about that?
[37:58.49]That's part of the video game.
[37:59.61]Alright, so I have... How many do I have?
[38:02.27]I need two more.
[38:03.71]Okay, let's go this way.
[38:08.65]Let's do some platforming.
[38:16.03]What?
[38:16.25]Am I getting invisible walled?
[38:19.56]Shit, I am getting invisible walled.
[38:21.10]What the heck?
[38:30.19]240 of these.
[38:31.13]Alright, so... Go to jellyfish fields?
[38:38.16]Okay.
[38:39.08]I'll go to jellyfish fields.
[38:42.10]Is there a dash or a run?
[38:46.93]Or am I already running?
[38:53.45]Hey!
[38:54.46]I can!
[39:01.03]Wait.
[39:04.33]I can't, oh, you can't walk there.
[39:05.91]You have to go through the taxi thing.
[39:09.75]Oh, this is where we get to start.
[39:11.45]I can't walk there?
[39:11.96]That's a horrible scream.
[39:37.83]That's the kind of scream that like, I feel like Squidward was lying on like the medieval stretcher.
[39:43.69]That was fucking nuts.
[39:44.98]I mean that thing's gigantic.
[39:50.56]Santa.
[39:51.10]That's my favorite thing.
[39:53.74]That's my favorite line.
[40:09.65]When Squidward's pretending to be Santa Claus and SpongeBob keeps talking about how big his nose is, it's like just, it's total cartoon comedy.
[40:17.78]I've always been bald, but now I'm stung all over.
[40:22.42]Well, according to the jellyfisher field manual, severe jellyfish stings can be treated effectively by applying a thick layer of king jellyfish jelly to the affected areas.
[40:34.70]King jellyfish?
[40:38.29]I'm not bald.
[40:38.91]Yeah, neither am I. Good.
[40:40.47]We got something in common, you and I. Well, I guess you're going to go kill the king jellyfish?
[40:52.64]I'll stay here.
[40:54.07]Bald up here in excruciating pain.
[40:56.81]You do that.
[40:57.89]Don't worry, Squidward.
[40:59.27]I'll bring back that king jellyfish jelly for you to rub all over yourself.
[41:06.03]real voice he's just pretending the whole time alright let's go how did I do that for I didn't get every single crusties alright that's what I'm gonna have to call them crusties that's how I can't call them anything else oh what's this can I catch the jellyfish like what does it do nothing
[41:30.92]This is goo.
[41:32.56]SpongeBob and Patrick can't swim, so don't let them fall in the goo.
[41:46.83]So how much currency is a lot?
[41:49.57]This is a teleport box.
[41:51.71]When you have both of the teleport boxes in the area open, you may teleport between them by jumping inside.
[41:58.44]I don't have both, I don't think.
[42:00.22]I think I have to touch both, probably.
[42:03.44]Yeah.
[42:04.96]Okay, let's go.
[42:06.67]Cool.
[42:08.13]Collect everything.
[42:10.33]Do I have full underwear?
[42:15.81]Just said that.
[42:18.11]Yeah, I'm just processing information.
[42:22.06]You have your way to process info and I have mine.
[42:24.94]Mine happens to be I say something out loud and then go over it.
[42:30.64]I know.
[42:31.16]I already know what it is.
[42:32.10]I have to just activate my audio processor.
[42:41.24]Ow, that hurt.
[42:42.78]Is it one hit to kill him?
[42:43.52]Alright.
[42:44.80]I don't want to die in SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[42:49.03]I feel like a new sponge.
[42:52.95]Hold on, does this bounce?
[42:55.51]Wow.
[42:56.93]Alright, that's fun.
[42:59.00]Yeah.
[43:00.16]Wait, I probably can get pretty far from there.
[43:04.22]Hold on.
[43:08.78]This is great.
[43:11.69]This is fun.
[43:12.71]I like this game.
[43:18.82]Am I allowed to say this is better than Mario Odyssey?
[43:22.05]Fuck.
[43:23.19]No, I can't say that.
[43:29.19]I'm sorry.
[43:31.31]I'm sorry.
[43:37.64]It's not, okay?
[43:39.52]It's not.
[43:40.30]It's called a joke.
[43:42.86]That Mario Odyssey is fantastic.
[43:45.08]Oh, fuck.
[43:45.26]What am I supposed to do?
[43:46.04]I can't go back.
[43:48.87]I might as well step on the gas.
[43:54.19]That's 125.
[43:54.49]Ooh, checkpoint.
[44:06.14]Step on the gas, step on the brakes.
[44:09.42]Step on the gas, step on the brake.
[44:11.28]Now step on the... Well, you're saying it wrong.
[44:13.12]It's... Step gas, step on brake, step on, step on, step gas.
[44:18.00]I would have understood what you were talking about if you said it that way.
[44:25.63]Wait, I don't want to go over there yet.
[44:28.45]Okay, where do I want to go?
[44:34.59]There are green shamrocks over there.
[44:37.97]I want them.
[44:38.35]I got to check... I'll get his underwear over there.
[44:43.04]That's a secret.
[44:44.90]Yeah, but I know... Look, I'm...
[44:48.38]Hey, you play your Super Mario Odyssey games the way you play the way you like, and I play my Super Mario Odyssey games the way that I like.
[44:55.30]Holy shit.
[45:03.47]Look at this.
[45:04.25]Am I going to die if I go down here?
[45:12.35]This is goo, right?
[45:13.45]Can I land on it, though?
[45:16.15]What if I just land on it?
[45:19.28]If I land on it, does it... Okay, I have a question.
[45:22.42]So, if I touch this, does it go like... And we get a silhouette close around the character.
[45:32.46]Yeah?
[45:34.03]And then we go back to the beginning.
[45:44.87]I didn't touch it?
[45:45.55]How?
[45:45.73]How?
[46:07.32]I- there's no way I didn't touch that.
[46:10.00]I don't know how that's- I touched it.
[46:11.58]I touched it.
[46:14.80]Slow that down.
[46:15.52]I can't touch it.
[46:22.92]You don't get it this way.
[46:25.44]You can't get it that way.
[46:26.72]Well... Look, there's no penalty for dying.
[46:29.96]That's a fall joke.
[46:32.76]No, I'm touching it!
[46:38.30]You're wasting underwear.
[46:41.12]What do you mean, wasting underwear?
[46:42.50]Does SpongeBob piss his pants or shit his pants every time he fucking dies?
[46:46.18]Wow, shit, yeah, you do.
[46:47.94]Okay, that makes sense.
[46:49.04]Never mind.
[46:52.49]Yeah, I forgot.
[46:53.35]How does that happen, Steve?
[46:54.11]Yeah, that happens to everybody.
[47:05.38]The question I should be asking is, why does he come back to life?
[47:12.28]That was plain.
[47:13.56]Uh-huh.
[47:14.18]Alright, how do I get that sock?
[47:17.96]Hmm.
[47:18.04]I'm gonna use the breather.
[47:24.95]It's a video game.
[47:28.65]Yeah, I... What?
[47:30.09]We're just talking.
[47:30.83]Okay.
[47:32.19]If you are defeated after activating a checkpoint, you will restart at the checkpoint instead of at the beginning of the area.
[47:41.86]How do I get this?
[47:43.96]Is it like a floating thing I can use eventually?
[47:52.12]Doctor.
[47:52.56]He thinks he's screaming again.
[47:58.19]Yes, he does.
[48:00.45]He does.
[48:00.83]Because he is.

[48:25.69]Why?

[52:07.39]King Jellyfish.
[52:08.31]Oh, that's the first boss.
[52:11.31]I don't want to see what this does.
[52:15.57]This is a bungee jump.
[52:16.43]SpongeBob can bungee from it.
[52:18.75]Bungee from the bungee hook.
[52:19.79]Just jump up and touch it.
[52:21.57]Dive, press A. Dags the hook, press B. Ooh!

[52:40.08]Okay, cool.
[52:41.52]Nice.
[52:44.98]Alright, that's how you do it.
[52:52.64]Let's go kill King Jellyfish.
[52:56.70]Get four.
[53:00.77]It shines!
[53:05.02]I promise, I know there's a lot of people probably waiting for me to do like the quintessential classic jive when you move your finger up and down your throat.
[53:15.37]It's gonna be crazed.
[53:16.39]I'm gonna do it at one point.
[53:17.39]I'm not gonna tell you when.
[53:19.17]But that's the only reason why you're here.
[53:22.39]It's gonna happen fucking crazed at one point.
[53:25.47]I don't know.
[53:25.80]It could happen in like four hours.
[53:26.98]I have no idea.
[53:30.91]just my size you've just met the sponginator excellent hey are you guys minus doing spongebob I'm pretty sure that's illegal
[53:59.38]Hey, what can I reverse it I just
[54:27.70]I need underwear.
[54:28.22]If I'm going to fight King Jellyfish, how the hell am I going to do this?
[54:36.18]You can wait until after he swings down the hand.
[54:45.13]You know how... You know when there's a game mechanic that is just stuck in your brain forever and you'll never get rid of it?
[54:54.03]I was just thinking to myself, like, oh, I wish there was, like, a dodge roll.
[54:56.49]It doesn't have to be in every single game.
[54:59.39]But it kind of does now, doesn't it?
[55:05.45]FromSoftware has ruined all video games.
[55:08.21]For life.
[55:09.21]Because if there's not, like, a... Like, what have they done?
[55:39.97]I thought I could get the edge.
[55:40.82]Okay.
[55:43.12]Prince of Persia did it first?
[55:44.46]Yeah, we're not talking about who did it first, we're talking about who did it best.
[55:59.61]Yeah, back at like the fucking 1700s, a guy made up toothpaste.
[56:02.69]He was brushing his teeth with like cream.
[56:05.68]He did it first.
[56:09.37]Wasn't until fucking Dave Colgate came along.
[56:13.09]He did it best.
[56:13.81]Yeah, the guy that made the toothbrush is cool, when the guy that was brushing his teeth was sand.
[56:28.05]Uh-uh.
[56:36.48]I feel like a new sponge!
[56:39.30]You're a corporate shill.
[56:46.74]Corporate shill.
[56:51.21]Okay, alright, alright, you ready?
[56:52.91]Ready?
[56:53.41]3, 2, 1, name any other brand of toothpaste right now, go.
[56:56.75]Name a single brand of toothpaste that's not Colgate, go.
[57:01.97]Fuck, Crest!
[57:02.61]Alright, not Crest.
[57:03.75]Something else that's not Crest.
[57:06.68]This is like 3, okay?
[57:09.35]There's like one, there's two on Earth.
[57:16.23]Oral B?
[57:17.41]Oh, but that's only if you want to brush like a dentist.
[57:19.87]Fuck.
[57:28.02]Aquafresh?
[57:28.68]Why can I not say this word?
[57:30.99]Aquafresh is the best.
[57:32.29]By far.
[57:33.71]Without a doubt in my mind.
[57:35.91]Like, everybody just buys Colgate and Crest.
[57:37.71]Like, what the fuck?
[57:38.47]It's just the easiest thing to get.
[57:39.51]But Aquafresh, holy shit.
[57:41.03]Especially that, like, orange, like, shower cream, like, one.
[57:44.17]You know what I'm talking about?
[57:44.94]The one that said it was a shower for your mouth.
[57:46.94]It was, like, an ad campaign.
[57:47.86]It was just marketing bullshit.
[57:49.36]That was the best one by far.
[57:51.47]It had the orange line.
[57:53.21]It was the aqua fresh, like shower for your mouth clean.
[57:57.65]It was the best one.
[58:07.22]Show the ad.
[58:09.76]I don't think there was an ad.
[58:18.70]Show the ad.
[58:20.62]I don't think it... I don't think... They just... The ad was just... It was on the shelf.
[58:23.80]That's what they said.
[58:24.58]Hold on.
[58:27.54]Let's see.
[58:33.22]Let's see.
[58:33.80]Aqua Fresh.
[58:35.36]Shower for your mouth.
[58:44.50]Wait.
[58:45.42]What the fuck?
[58:50.04]Wait a minute.
[58:51.12]The first thing that pops up is a shower for your mouth.
[58:58.44]What is this thing?
[59:05.57]Can we go over?
[59:06.47]Can we examine this for just a minute?
[59:09.19]Okay, what is this?
[59:22.08]Hold on, I don't want to put that image up.
[59:23.68]Okay.
[59:24.96]It's this one.
[59:25.40]What is this?
[59:27.66]Do you put your mouth up around the edges of that and just turn it on?
[59:32.87]How does this work?
[59:35.31]I like it.
[59:35.69]I'm intrigued by this.
[59:37.05]This actually is... I kind of want to see how this works.
[59:41.71]Do you like wrap your mouth around it?
[59:47.11]It's the hose?
[59:49.04]So wait, you put... Okay, so hold on a minute.
[59:51.38]This is... I love this.
[59:52.74]I don't know why.
[59:54.22]I like this.
[59:55.56]So the red cap is like the toothpaste or something?
[60:00.07]And then you like... You turn the hose on with this in your mouth and you're just like... It goes... No, it doesn't.
[60:11.92]It does not go.
[60:14.64]No, it does not go.
[60:15.84]I'm not even going to say it.
[60:20.81]It's as seen on TV.
[60:25.16]It's a water flosser for your shower head.
[60:29.54]I think I want this.
[60:33.64]You know how hard it is to floss every day?
[60:35.25]Imagine you could just like put a tube in your mouth and just turn the water on full blast.
[60:39.77]Does this work?
[60:40.37]It's got four stars.
[60:42.85]I'm not even fucking around with you right now.
[60:45.15]This has four stars on Amazon with like 2,000 fucking reviews.
[60:48.64]This thing is probably cool.
[60:51.71]I'm gonna have to look into this after the stream.
[60:55.39]Alright, let's go.
[61:01.65]It goes.
[61:08.34]It goes.
[61:09.14]I can't.
[61:11.98]You guys are so fucked up.
[61:14.72]And I'm the fucking weird guy, right?
[61:16.54]That's the thing.
[61:17.80]I'm the weird guy.
[61:23.35]This is very dangerous for just one health pack.
[61:36.38]Oh yeah, try this new water flosser.
[61:40.46]It goes... I can't say it.
[61:46.94]I can't even.
[61:47.68]I can't do it.
[61:53.93]Connected to your bidet.
[61:57.27]And to put it in... Alright, I'm moving on.
[62:02.23]And what?
[62:03.10]As you're on the toilet, you put it in your mouth and floss?
[62:07.94]And then what?
[62:08.44]Spit down between your legs into the toilet?
[62:13.94]Yeah, I got... Oh, I got teleport.
[62:19.72]That machine huffing and puffing over there is a Duplicat- Duplicatotron?
[62:24.13]I'm going to call it the Duplicator.
[62:26.31]Duplicator.
[62:26.91]The Duplicator.
[62:29.57]I'll call it the D-1000.
[62:30.67]That will continue to create robots until it's destroyed.
[62:34.55]Be careful, though.
[62:35.27]It goes out with a big bang.
[62:45.10]Ooh, you can- That's cool.
[62:48.12]Alright, we gotta kill this thing.
[62:53.46]That was a big bang, wasn't it?
[62:55.50]Oh, there's a button.
[63:03.78]Coked out streamer flosses his teeth with a bidet.
[63:10.28]Alright, alright.
[63:11.50]You know as well as I do that there is a 90s comedy, or an early 2000s comedy, where, like, Will Ferrell has to really get something out of his mouth and rinse his mouth, and... What's this?
[63:26.77]A bidet!
[63:27.69]And he leans down like fucking cartoon Three Stooges style and turns it on and starts like rinsing his mouth out and like spitting into the toilet with a bidet.
[63:35.72]You know it exists.
[63:36.74]It's in a movie somewhere.
[63:38.04]I don't know which one and I don't know when.
[63:39.84]But it happened.
[63:49.77]What do you look it up?
[63:50.43]You want me to look up Will Ferrell rinse his mouth with a bidet?
[64:05.87]That sounds like some... Where's the king jellyfish already?
[64:14.06]Is he up there?
[64:14.58]Alright, I got... I have five.
[64:20.18]That is... It's in a movie.
[64:21.42]It's a life hack.
[64:25.66]Mr. Bean did it.
[64:26.60]No, he didn't.
[64:27.36]He's too clean for that.
[64:34.84]Is there anything else I missed?
[64:36.16]Up there.
[64:36.60]What do you mean he's not?
[64:44.87]Come on, can I get up there?
[64:48.47]Go back.
[64:48.63]Wrong way.
[64:51.51]Mr. Bean is too clean to do that.
[64:53.81]He's like PG, clean, fun humor.
[64:56.26]He's not...
[65:04.39]I like this cave.
[65:07.32]Uh, up in the trees.
[65:09.96]Ooh.
[65:11.24]Jerm of the trees.
[65:12.08]Jerm of the trees!
[65:14.16]I mean, these, the bouncy trees.
[65:23.35]Ooh, look at those bouncy trees.
[65:28.05]Literally, no.
[65:32.01]Look, I can get up there with the bouncy tree.
[65:41.60]there's a sock over here I can get up there see yeah this is what I wanted there's another bouncy right here somebody just say you're a dick I'm a dick what happened
[66:12.78]Oh nice.
[67:05.20]Oh, sorry.
[67:05.74]I had to give Kim some information that was sensitive, so I had to say it very quietly without the mic on.
[67:15.84]Fucking sensitive info.
[67:20.97]He was crying.
[67:25.73]Okay, I'm going.
[67:27.03]I'm going.
[67:29.21]I'm sitting there just crying like...
[67:32.58]A second day back.
[67:33.52]I don't know what you're gonna mean to me.
[67:35.08]I'm just going to the caves.
[67:39.74]Let's go.
[67:40.18]Go to the caves.
[67:46.76]He lost in a kid's game.
[67:47.90]It's only been like six months since he's done Miss Piggy.
[67:55.47]I have all your comics and toys and mail.
[67:59.75]Huh?
[68:01.11]What?
[68:02.62]Oh, yeah, it's that sponge kid.
[68:06.78]Now, what was I supposed to tell you?
[68:09.36]Hey, Bill.
[68:13.19]Oh, it's that SpongeBob kid.
[68:15.41]Now, what was I supposed to tell you?
[68:18.23]That Patrick is surrounded by robots and needs my help.
[68:27.87]I think it has something to do with massaging my feet.
[68:32.30]What are you... You want me to say it?
[68:34.54]I think we need to get into the Batmobile and get over there and destroy... Should I say it?
[68:40.49]I should say it.
[69:01.30]Fuck!
[69:01.70]It's an old man.
[69:02.24]I just did that.
[69:02.83]Whoops.
[69:03.43]I had my fingers slipped and it was an X button working quickly.
[69:08.73]Ooh.
[69:10.91]This is a slide.
[69:12.69]When SpongeBob, Patrick, or Sandy jump onto a slide, they will zip down the slope at hydrodynamic speed.
[69:26.20]Didn't think I knew about the secret spot, did you?
[69:34.46]Oh, what?
[69:37.32]That was going so well, too.
[69:38.40]That was going so well.
[69:59.56]Oh, so by the way, I didn't tell this story because there's too many of the last people I've seen.
[70:06.71]Okay.
[70:08.33]Seriously.
[70:09.07]Don't tell any stories.
[70:09.95]Get the fucking secret sock.
[70:14.23]Play Half-Life.
[70:15.01]No, I don't want to play Half-Life.
[70:17.05]It's a fantastic series and it's one of my favorites.
[70:20.80]I've already done it a bunch of times.
[70:23.78]No.
[70:24.16]No, I want to do something else.
[70:26.94]I'm on my tongue.
[70:27.38]I'm on my tongue.
[70:33.71]You!
[70:34.50]Patrick needs to do laundry.
[70:38.69]Alright, so, I don't know why, so you guys know I've been to a lot of doctor's appointments, right?
[70:43.05]And at every single doctor's appointment, most of them check your vitals, right?
[70:46.33]So they'll put the little, they'll check your temperature, they'll say, okay, let's do your blood pressure, or let's sit down for a second, let's check your weight and all that, right?
[70:54.40]So I don't know why, but I've had my blood pressure checked like dozens of times, like probably 20 fucking times in the last six months, right?
[71:04.67]For this, for some reason now, like the last doctor's appointment I went to, I was getting the... It was an automatic machine.
[71:14.13]And while it was going on, she came out, she put it on, she pressed the button.
[71:19.54]I started laughing so hard.
[71:21.02]I couldn't help it.
[71:21.70]I couldn't stop.
[71:22.42]Because it was crushing me.
[71:24.20]It was really, really uncomfortable.
[71:26.02]And the reason why I was laughing so hard is because...
[71:29.94]Have you guys seen the Beavis and Butthead episode?
[71:31.76]Where Beavis and Butthead are at a CVS or something.
[71:37.17]And Beavis puts his arm in that thing and they think it's a ride.
[71:39.79]And it starts going on his arm and crushing him.
[71:44.05]And he starts freaking the fuck out because he doesn't know what it is.
[71:47.80]I was sitting there just thinking about Beavis and how I was like acting, how I was thinking that way.
[71:51.88]I was like, oh my god, get me the fuck out of this.
[71:54.26]And I'm just sitting there laughing.
[71:55.38]And I can't tell, like, the nurse why I'm laughing.
[72:00.50]Like, what's, what's, is that funny?
[72:03.44]Yeah.
[72:03.90]Remember when Beavis, like, freaks out and his, like, face starts turning purple because he had this thing put on his arm?
[72:10.00]Remember that?
[72:11.84]Oh, yeah, you, okay.
[72:13.16]You write that down.
[72:19.74]I don't know why I just started thinking about it.
[72:22.00]I couldn't stop.
[72:23.82]It was really tight though.
[72:33.80]Like Beavis and Butthead comedy type.
[72:36.18]Gotta hit all three of these buttons, right?
[72:44.57]You're a loon.
[72:47.36]I don't think I am.
[72:55.77]Do you think I'm a loon?
[73:01.31]One in chat if yes, two in chat if no.
[73:03.41]Do you think I'm a loon?
[73:16.23]Can I buy costumes?
[73:17.55]Okay, where's the last one?
[73:20.93]Oh, there it is.
[73:40.78]I have a question.
[73:42.10]Is the Bart thing going to turn into Johnny Depp?
[73:46.58]Is just Johnny Depp being a parody of himself as Captain Jack Sparrow because he's done it so many times?
[73:51.97]Is that going to happen to me?
[73:54.27]Is that happening to me?
[74:02.34]Like, it's no longer Johnny Depp doing Captain Jack Sparrow.
[74:05.58]It's just Johnny Depp pretending to be Captain Jack Sparrow.
[74:08.25]It's not actually Captain Jack Sparrow.
[74:09.61]Do you guys know what I'm talking about when I mean that?
[74:11.33]When I say that?
[74:11.79]You know, like, it feels real.
[74:18.15]It feels like it's just acting.
[74:21.68]Somebody knows what I mean by that, right?
[74:23.14]Like, it's like Johnny Depp is doing a parody almost of himself when he's doing it now.
[74:28.54]Does that make any sense?
[74:37.86]Absolutely.
[74:38.44]Thank you.
[74:41.50]Thank you, one guy.
[74:42.62]Alright, so what did that do for me?
[74:47.80]Oh, Patrick!
[74:49.96]Nobody said that.
[74:50.58]Yeah, at least ten people did.
[74:51.70]Jerma Johnny Depp.
[75:02.65]Jerma what?
[75:04.43]Hey, Spongebob!
[75:09.96]You're cherry-picking responses.
[75:11.76]Thank goodness you're safe, Patrick.
[75:17.59]Well, of course, SpongeBob.
[75:19.41]Why wouldn't I be?
[75:21.71]Only pull out the ones that agree with you.
[75:23.31]And don't, and just ignore the sea of people that disagree.
[75:29.62]Did you guys think I'm right?
[75:30.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[75:36.46]Yes, no, no.
[75:37.50]Oh, you think I'm right.
[75:38.18]Thanks, cool, thank you.
[75:39.14]Cool.
[75:40.51]I know, I am.
[75:41.25]You literally do that, you have an emote about it.
[75:45.91]Yeah.
[75:46.33]I don't know.
[76:09.33]Oh, I'm Patrick now.
[76:16.98]Can he fly?
[76:17.56]I feel like he can fly.
[76:18.88]No.
[76:18.94]Don't you think he can lie down flat like a starfish and glide or spin and glide?
[76:24.26]This is a throw fruit.
[76:32.54]I thought you could pick up a throw fruit and throw them.
[76:34.54]Press the B button to pick up a nearby throw fruit.
[76:40.67]Okay.
[76:41.87]Use it quickly.
[76:43.09]It will suffer a few seconds.
[76:49.93]How far can you throw it?
[76:52.03]That was a bad example.
[76:52.97]Oh, there's a lock-on.
[77:03.70]Hatcher can also pick up and throw Tikis, but only Tikis that don't have other Tikis stacked on top of them.
[77:16.92]I'm trying to throw it at that guy.
[77:20.20]So shiny!
[77:21.80]Hatcher can throw fruit up steps.
[77:29.53]What's happening?
[77:30.29]Then climb the steps, pick up the fruit, and throw it again.
[77:33.75]But he better hurt before it wilts.
[77:44.04]Real voice.
[77:44.92]No, it wasn't real.
[77:52.72]Morty.
[77:54.96]Real Morty.
[77:56.50]Oh fuck, I didn't even read!
[78:05.33]Okay, you can throw stuff.
[78:09.49]This is a thunder tiki.
[78:10.57]When Patrick touches it, it will begin to storm, and after a few seconds, it will go boom.
[78:14.15]Don't be near it when it goes boom.
[78:16.61]Okay.
[78:20.29]How many pairs of underwear does Patrick have?
[78:21.83]The same.
[78:26.62]I feel like these are here for a reason.
[78:36.31]Oh, whoops.
[78:38.00]Okay, anything else over here?
[78:40.24]Alright, I can read it.
[78:47.18]This is a special Patrick teeter-totter that only Patrick can use.
[78:51.07]Okay, that's a really important point.
[78:54.59]SpongeBob can't use this shit.
[78:58.03]Yeah, okay.
[79:00.23]He didn't notice.
[79:00.97]Why is everybody dabbing?
[79:14.01]Okay, who's your, who, are you ready?
[79:16.47]Who's your favorite Spongebob character?
[79:18.33]I'll tell you mine after you tell me yours.
[79:23.54]Okay.
[79:23.80]Okay.
[79:39.66]I'm seeing a lot of, yeah, I'm seeing a lot of things that I would agree with.
[79:41.82]Oh, hi there, Mr. Plankton.
[79:43.18]Are you going to vaporize me today?
[79:46.72]So very tempting.
[79:49.58]Unfortunately, I found myself in the undesirable position of having to assist you.
[79:55.59]This is the guy that screams, yeah.
[79:57.99]I was in an undesirable position yesterday, and now my neck hurts.
[80:04.06]Which Looney Tune Daffy Duck would I be?
[80:05.96]That's easy.
[80:06.42]Which Looney Tune character would you be?
[80:07.64]Daffy Duck.
[80:09.06]Or... Or the Roadrunner.
[80:11.56]Because I'm really fast at explosive.
[80:13.44]Either one.
[80:13.98]Combine them.
[80:14.30]I don't need more.
[80:14.84]No.
[80:15.02]Maybe not.
[80:29.82]Go into Jellyfish Cave, follow the instructions and sign.
[80:32.27]At the end of the caves, you'll still be a big idiot, but you'll know enough to help defeat the robots.
[80:38.71]Well, then will you vaporize me?
[80:42.15]I might spare your life so I can force you to work in my sweatshop, making low-quality design and knock-off wallets.
[80:49.36]Oh, thank you!
[80:53.76]Didn't tell us his favorite character.
[80:56.10]Roadrunner.
[80:57.58]Oh, for SpongeBob, right.
[80:58.96]Uh...
[81:01.75]Have you guys ever seen a Roadrunner in real life?
[81:04.32]They are the most, they're my favorite bird on Earth.
[81:07.30]They're the most cute little, funny little guys.
[81:09.72]They're amazing.
[81:12.64]They're so cool.
[81:14.31]The way that they run, they got those funny little mohawks.
[81:16.77]They're little, they're not huge.
[81:19.09]They're fast.
[81:20.77]They go like 25 miles per hour.
[81:22.49]They're fast.
[81:29.61]Oh, Stalling.
[81:30.28]Stalling is... Oh, right, right.
[81:31.62]His favorite Spongebob character.
[81:33.00]It's... Hmm.
[81:36.66]Pre-Season 5, it's gonna be Patrick.
[81:39.48]Post-Season 6, it's gonna be Mr. Krabs.
[81:56.02]That's a really hot take, dude.
[81:58.65]What the fuck is he saying?
[81:59.71]I'm talking about my favorite Spongebob characters, and before season four... Whatever the early one I said, Patrick's my favorite character.
[82:07.85]And then after season five... After season five, it's Mr. Krabs, because I just think he's funny.
[82:22.54]Don't watch past season four.
[82:25.18]See, I don't agree with that.
[82:29.37]I know, I know that like the first four or five seasons were like just way better.
[82:32.89]I know, they were.
[82:34.01]And then like after like season 10, it was like, okay.
[82:37.66]I did this twice?
[82:45.08]This joke is as salvageable as the Titanic.
[82:51.66]Talking about who my favorite character in Spongebob is?
[83:00.69]Wait, what?
[83:01.73]That's... That's so sad.
[83:06.35]What do you mean, joke?
[83:11.94]One came out when you were like 20.
[83:20.83]Yeah, I don't know.
[83:21.33]I mean, just do the math.
[83:22.20]Yeah, something like that.
[83:23.18]I thought it was great.
[83:26.16]I can't jump?
[83:26.96]Oh, you're right.
[83:28.12]I can't jump.
[83:28.72]Hold on.
[83:28.92]Can I throw this?
[83:30.44]How far can I throw this?
[83:34.87]Give it to me.
[83:37.93]Come on!
[83:38.55]Stand here.
[83:43.09]What?
[83:45.97]I just fell.
[83:48.38]This dude's fucking ancient.
[83:53.09]Sorry, I'm over 30.
[83:55.73]Fuck, what's happening?
[84:02.50]So what happens when I turn?
[84:03.40]Alright, you get out of here.
[84:11.00]I'm paying attention.
[84:11.86]I don't care about anything right now.
[84:13.18]Hold on.
[84:19.61]That's what I wanted to do.
[84:21.93]Here we are.
[84:22.67]Thank you.
[84:23.53]When are you going to do new emotes?
[84:37.48]You know, I don't think I'm ever going to give a date for that.
[84:39.18]Because I keep saying I'm going to make new emotes.
[84:41.60]And then a year goes by and nothing happens.
[84:44.91]I just, like, mass spam went through a bunch of stuff on better Twitch.
[84:51.02]Because I was like, yeah, let's just add, like, fucking 10 of them.
[85:01.08]We're so lonely.
[85:03.28]There will be.
[85:04.72]I just... I don't know.
[85:14.09]The weight of throw fruit will also activate pressure plates.
[85:16.61]Okay, cool.
[85:21.54]Now I can run through, but wait.
[85:24.50]Yeah, whatever.
[85:29.04]Patrick can also jump up on a throw fruit to get to higher places.
[85:33.08]He may stack throw fruits as well by throwing a throw fruit on top of another throw fruit.
[85:37.61]This will allow Patrick to get to even higher places.
[85:39.53]Well, don't they have to wait for a spawn?
[85:52.76]Does that not matter right now?
[86:11.55]Okay.
[86:11.95]Oh.
[86:12.39]This is kind of how I feel.
[86:14.87]Like 40% of every day.
[86:16.47]Can I tell you that?
[86:17.71]Not like that.
[86:18.19]Not like that.
[86:18.65]Not like that.
[86:19.07]Not like that.
[86:19.45]Not like that.
[86:51.01]Let's play.
[86:51.83]Let's throw him this way.
[87:02.10]No, the log!
[87:02.62]Achoo!
[87:05.04]I can still do it.
[87:06.86]Good work.
[87:21.35]Oh, I didn't know this was a slide check.
[87:23.09]I almost lost.
[87:46.58]I want to spend some of this.
[87:47.44]Oh, wait.
[87:47.74]Patrick can drink this, right?
[87:49.48]This is a freezy fruit.
[87:50.40]Patrick's favorite.
[87:52.91]They can throw it.
[87:54.91]Freeze goo.
[87:55.49]You can slide on it until it thaws.
[87:59.81]Let's take a look.
[88:02.91]Well, that's interesting.
[88:04.03]I'll have to do it again in a minute.
[88:06.81]I'm going to go up there first.
[88:09.09]Patrick belly flops near robots.
[88:13.40]He can damage or stun them.
[88:19.87]That's awesome.
[88:21.65]It's the same sound effect as Spyro?
[88:23.95]It was the same team?
[88:26.17]Maybe it was the same team.
[88:27.53]Overpowered?
[88:31.90]It is pretty overpowered actually.
[88:36.76]It was the same death team.
[88:38.66]That's pretty cool.
[88:41.50]Was it?
[88:48.54]Patrick may even pick up robots he has stunned and throw them into other robots.
[88:56.42]Oh.
[89:00.88]Oh, well I crushed him.
[89:10.44]Almost happened.
[89:11.56]I'm gonna try it.
[89:17.21]Alright, well that you... You're too close!
[89:20.89]Alright, that thing was small.
[89:52.52]That's cool, but when am I ever going to use that?
[89:59.20]Well, that didn't even do what I thought it was going to do.
[90:29.65]And spatula.
[90:36.65]This game sucks.
[90:39.87]It doesn't.
[90:40.70]It really doesn't.
[90:41.34]It's fine.
[90:42.40]This game does not suck.
[90:46.36]Wait, I want to do the ice thing.
[90:52.48]This may in fact be the last great licensed video game.
[90:56.30]Is that true?
[91:02.40]That accurate no, what was the last great licensed video game?
[91:12.13]Based on like a tea like a cartoon or a TV show or a movie I Don't I don't I'm not sure I count comic books right now Like Batman spider-man like caught like this, I don't I'm talking about like TV show I
[91:28.19]Like, just based on a TV show.
[91:30.53]Not on, like, an iconic character that's been around in, like, comic books and shit for, like, fucking 50 years.
[91:37.52]Batman's been around for a very long time.
[91:39.22]I'm talking, like, solely like a licensed movie video game or a licensed TV show video game.
[91:46.78]You don't count it because it answers it.
[91:47.98]No, because I gave separate criteria.
[91:49.38]Like, TV show only.
[91:52.57]Spider-Man wasn't a TV show for like 30 years.
[91:55.13]Before... Wait, what?
[91:57.92]When did Spider-Man get invented?
[91:58.96]Probably South Park.
[92:04.62]Maybe.
[92:07.48]Is this Seinfeld?
[92:13.94]Samurai Jack game?
[92:15.96]Is that good?
[92:25.91]Okay, so many people just said it and then now so many people you say are saying no.
[92:32.97]There's a purple one over there.
[92:33.99]Oh dear.
[92:37.00]Oh dear.
[92:38.20]These guys talk.
[92:40.38]Alright, I'm good.
[92:41.92]I got what I wanted.
[92:58.42]South Park games have been good.
[92:59.62]Yeah, and weirdly enough, I never gave either one of them a chance.
[93:04.61]And I always knew that they were good.
[93:06.59]Don't ask me why.
[93:08.67]I don't know.
[93:09.07]Here we are.
[93:13.92]Yes?
[93:20.51]Shark Tank?
[93:23.37]Dude, I would love a Shark Tank video game, even if it was dog shit.
[93:33.38]You know how much fun that would be?
[93:39.64]Why didn't they make that for the Wii?
[93:41.56]Imagine with the Wiimote, and shit, you make like a product, and with like shitty 3D rendered Mark Cuban.
[93:48.56]I want that for the Wii.
[93:49.42]Like a 2005 version of that game.
[93:53.80]Shark Tank didn't exist in 2005.
[93:55.58]Why not?
[93:56.22]Oh boy, Mr. Krabs.
[93:58.12]I'll see what I can do.
[94:03.24]I'm talking about, I want Mark Cuban to be rendered in the terrain editor.
[94:07.28]Not even like the model.
[94:08.24]I want like a pure, just like old fucking shitty 3D video game.
[94:21.89]Uh-oh.
[94:23.01]Boss fight.
[94:24.96]This whole body was chattering, but not his tongue.
[94:50.57]You're not going to take all my 3882 coins, are you?
[95:01.77]No, you just killed him.
[95:09.16]He was not even a big deal.
[95:10.42]Oh, it's this guy!
[95:11.10]This guy's my favorite character in Spongebob.
[95:13.58]I remember this.
[95:14.14]Yeah, this guy's my favorite.
[95:15.42]You know why?
[95:16.89]Because this guy always reminded me of those little aliens from the Jim Henson Muppet shit.
[95:22.53]The guys that go like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:26.11]That's my favorite character.
[95:32.73]I just didn't know what his name was.
[95:41.36]It was this guy with huge folding down mouth.
[95:49.32]Oh, Mrs. Puff.
[95:50.50]Hello, Patrick.
[95:51.92]I've got a job for you to do.
[95:53.32]Oh, boy.
[95:54.94]Actually, it could be Mrs. Puff.
[95:55.90]Yeah, it might be Mrs. Puff.
[95:56.66]No, I changed my answer.
[95:57.48]It's Mrs. Puff.
[95:57.86]That's my favorite character.
[95:58.74]I remember... She was so fun.
[95:59.42]Sure enough, Mrs. Puff.
[96:23.99]She doesn't do anything.
[96:25.83]Um... She's actually one of the only characters in the entire series that is very concerned with how fucking... How Spongebob, like, breaks shit and hurts people.
[96:41.40]The only character in the whole series.
[96:48.36]This farm...
[96:56.78]about Squidward?
[97:00.72]I think Squidward's just irritated that he exists and hates him because he exists.
[97:04.74]I'm not sure Squidward's ever concerned about anything he does.
[97:09.98]I think he just hates him.
[97:13.50]It's never like, ah, SpongeBob, why did you do that?
[97:16.04]Let me tell you some ways that you could do that differently instead of throwing my flute into the dumpster.
[97:22.79]No, he's just like, you idiot, I hate you.
[97:25.93]Mrs. Puff is like, SpongeBob, did you hit the brake?
[97:29.12]Just slowly, my friend.
[97:31.48]Mrs. Puff tries to help him.
[97:36.78]Oh, um, I think, well, uh, no.
[97:43.08]What am I supposed to do?
[97:44.16]Did you get the golden spatula back from the robots on the island?
[97:47.30]Okay, robots on the island get the spatula from the robots on the island.
[97:49.75]You got it.
[97:57.26]So bright.
[97:59.32]So shiny.
[98:00.74]I have to get, I have to kill that.
[98:03.00]Oh, I know what to do.
[98:03.98]Throw the nuke.
[98:09.77]Ouch.
[98:13.45]Wait, you can get double tapped?
[98:17.43]Fun.
[98:18.53]I don't think Spongebob's underwear fits quite right.
[98:21.76]Play as a whistle.
[98:28.91]Wait, should I... Hmm.
[98:30.11]I hadn't thought of that.
[98:37.55]Harming.
[98:41.25]Can I not reach from there?
[98:46.91]Do I have to just destroy all the buildings?
[98:53.43]Can't reach from here.
[98:58.35]There's the guard breaker.
[99:01.59]Dude, you're killing me.
[99:07.82]What does kill mean?
[99:10.40]Right?
[99:13.80]Because these are robots that are just... Does kill mean organic or does kill mean to a robot too?
[99:20.86]I made a whole game about this.
[99:22.28]I played it.
[99:27.81]How do I get over there?
[99:28.43]Can I not?
[99:28.85]Can I throw him?
[99:32.60]Wait a minute.
[99:36.08]Should I... Throwing.
[99:44.58]Should I just walk around and throw it at that?
[99:47.10]I can't reach from there.
[99:49.47]Can I...
[100:06.27]get him on the bridge children's game children's game children's game children's game children's game children's game children's game children's game lost in children's game
[100:33.04]Alright.
[100:34.09]Children's game.
[100:34.75]It's still there.
[100:35.19]No, I'm trying to... Simpsons hit and run all over again.
[100:51.34]No, it's not.
[100:52.00]This is going to be like... Have I ever played a game like this before?
[100:57.11]I don't think I have...
[101:01.53]Wait, what was that game that was... Yooka-Laylee.
[101:05.07]Yooka-Laylee.
[101:06.11]Oh, Mario Sunshine.
[101:07.09]Yeah.
[101:09.14]Yeah.
[101:17.88]I didn't play Mario Odyssey on stream.
[101:21.67]Played it a little bit off stream.
[101:23.47]And by the way, let me tell you.
[101:24.75]Perfect.
[101:25.85]Perfect.
[101:28.44]Don't listen to what that guy said to you like two hours ago.
[101:30.37]No.
[101:30.45]I'm gonna go.
[101:32.85]Okay, go.
[101:33.85]Go this way.
[101:34.91]Anything to say?
[101:36.95]Swap characters.
[101:38.61]Oh.
[101:55.26]Because I don't feel like playing with Patrick anymore?
[101:58.42]This is a shticky.
[101:59.58]SpongeBob will have to sneak up on it in order to destroy it.
[102:04.64]Ah, okay.
[102:06.66]Patrick may throw things at it from a distance.
[102:11.15]Well, let's change back to SpongeBob.
[102:21.77]That's a sneak.
[102:28.22]That's what they see.
[102:30.86]You know what I mean?
[102:34.68]Like, I... Bite him!
[102:36.01]Bite him!
[103:06.96]He's coming.
[103:16.02]The SpongeBob's a little less strong.
[103:17.80]Dude, you're unhinged.
[103:21.87]Look at me.
[103:41.29]Shit.
[103:42.73]Wait.
[103:42.91]Is there something up there?
[103:44.51]There's underwear up there.
[103:47.07]Yeah, I'm going to go get that stuff.
[103:50.89]Put on Doom OST.
[103:51.96]You want me to replace Spongebob music with Doom OST?
[103:54.38]Now here comes a real fight in the chat.
[103:56.36]This is going to get interesting, I think.
[103:59.10]That would be funny.
[104:13.11]Would it though?
[104:15.89]I'm not sure that would be very funny.
[104:26.20]Absolutely funny.
[104:30.56]No!
[104:31.74]No!
[104:34.44]SpongeBob should come back here later when he knows the cruise bubble move.
[104:38.34]Aww.
[104:43.12]I don't know the cruise bubble move.
[104:44.48]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[104:49.92]He's vetoing it.
[104:51.30]Oh, that already did.
[104:52.14]That already happened.
[104:56.44]That was vetoed when I read the D in Doom OST.
[105:12.23]I like the SpongeBob music.
[105:13.19]It's very relaxing.
[105:14.97]I want to get that sock.
[105:22.05]It goes all the way around.
[105:23.55]Okay, that's going to keep moving.
[105:30.70]It kind of worked.
[105:35.24]This is not relaxing at all.
[105:36.46]Wait, you don't think this is relaxing?
[105:47.48]You don't think so?
[105:48.14]Did I go on the wall?
[105:51.78]Where did I go?
[106:06.56]Have you never been sitting on the beach and this is just kind of playing?
[106:10.96]This is just like that's what they're playing on the beach.
[106:23.38]No, no, no.
[106:30.79]But you've never gone to any restaurant or a little bar on the beach?
[106:36.13]They all play this music.
[106:39.55]Everyone just looks around and goes like, yeah, mm-hmm, yeah, mm-hmm.
[106:42.84]They get a big sip of the drink.
[106:44.88]Yeah, mm-hmm.
[106:46.12]You just nod your head the whole time that you're in there.
[106:58.66]No, they don't.
[106:59.24]Yeah, they do.
[107:01.62]I've been in the same room when this happens.
[107:03.97]You take the sip of your big drink with the umbrella in it, and you go, you know, and the big, like, big shoe drink.
[107:11.19]It's a huge glass, like, shoe thing.
[107:13.03]I feel like a new sponge.
[107:17.26]I love opening presents.
[107:32.96]This is a stone tiki.
[107:34.68]That's my, you know, can I tell you?
[107:36.66]Stone is one of my favorite words.
[107:39.09]Cannot be destroyed with ordinary moves.
[107:40.47]It can be blown up by thunder tiki.
[107:45.15]Beach in Vegas.
[107:46.25]Guys, I'm 34 years old.
[107:48.76]You don't think I've ever been to a beach before with a drink in my, like, on the beach waterfront of, like, a beach restaurant before?
[107:55.40]In my, like, early 20s?
[108:03.59]as long as these pants are square and this sponge is Bob I will not let bikini bottom down you don't think I've ever been to a beach restaurant where it's like oh we have this like little beach drink oh I'll take one and the person that you're across from you go try this try
[108:31.23]And both of you take a sip of each other's, like, drinks.
[108:32.97]You go like, oh, whoa, this is what you should!
[108:37.37]And then you never go back.
[108:39.33]Ever.
[108:40.35]For the rest of your fucking life, you never go back to this restaurant or bar.
[108:44.24]Ever again.
[108:44.82]Alright.
[108:49.12]Get him.
[108:50.86]Okay.
[108:59.32]Okay.
[109:03.03]Somebody got that one wrong.
[109:12.18]Holy shit, that's a lot of stone in there.
[109:17.58]That's a lot of stone in there!
[109:19.14]I wanna see it.
[109:21.97]Yes!
[109:22.31]150 bucks to open this.
[109:26.45]Is that worth doing?
[109:28.15]I only have 6700.
[109:33.64]Do I watch VeggieTales?
[109:38.08]No, I never did.
[109:44.62]VeggieTales for me was just Alvin and the Chipmunks, but scary.
[110:02.66]And this is somebody that's an avid listener of Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[110:06.28]And by avid listener, I mean that every time an Alvin and the Chipmunks song ever came on the radio, it was immediately being turned down four or five notches on the volume.
[110:15.34]That's how you know an Alvin and the Chipmunks song has come on the radio.
[110:20.31]You immediately drop the volume.
[110:22.37]You're dead.
[110:34.09]You're not a Christian.
[110:41.76]Aren't you a Christian?
[110:48.46]What do you think?
[110:49.40]Who told you that?
[110:52.58]Oh, it's Patrick.
[111:03.26]Okay, there's never been one time on stream where I've been like, and guys, I want to make sure everyone knows, I'm a Christian.
[111:12.24]I don't, whatever.
[111:13.06]I don't give a shit who you are.
[111:20.59]He said it.
[111:28.93]You're deranged.
[111:31.07]Okay, hold on.
[111:34.42]I want the facts.
[111:35.12]I want the facts out here.
[111:36.60]So me just saying, you know, guys, no, I've never mentioned that before.
[111:39.24]I'm not a Christian.
[111:40.32]I've never said that.
[111:42.44]He's fucking deranged.
[111:44.56]Somebody wrap him up quick.
[111:52.33]Where's this thing spawning?
[111:54.27]Oh, over there.
[112:08.09]He's getting political.
[112:08.93]Cut the mic.
[112:12.01]Get my mic off.
[112:13.30]It's on forever.
[112:14.54]Unless there's a power outage.
[112:37.52]I told you that today was a weird one.
[112:39.30]I told you I was in a weird mood and I knew something.
[112:42.21]I told you.
[112:43.53]I prepared you guys two hours ago.
[112:45.19]I did.
[112:45.49]I told you two hours ago.
[112:48.15]Right?
[112:48.45]I did.
[112:48.69]I warned you.
[112:58.40]I can go to one of the new areas now.
[112:59.74]I can go downtown, right?
[113:05.40]Holy shit.
[113:14.57]This is such a random LOL stream.
[113:16.28]He's so random.
[113:19.00]Thanks for saying that, dude.
[113:20.18]I try so hard to be random.
[113:23.44]Is it working?
[113:26.08]I need 10 of these, right?
[113:43.58]We're going to go all the way around and there's another sock over there.
[113:45.78]Hulk burger nom nom.
[113:51.28]Oh boy.
[113:53.88]Now he's just pandering.
[114:01.29]Oh, you know what pandering looks like on this channel.
[114:03.31]I think that's what's happening right now.
[114:05.61]You know what that's like.
[114:07.94]You know what that is.
[114:13.47]Is that sock all the way across?
[114:16.56]Oh, this is gonna be annoying.
[114:24.07]What the fuck?
[114:24.99]I knocked him to the other side.
[114:39.58]Cool.
[114:40.46]Wait.
[114:41.86]Patrick can freeze this stuff.
[114:44.81]Hmm.
[114:48.29]Shit, I hate when I have to come back as other characters.
[114:50.97]There's so much content to do.
[114:53.91]What a fun game.
[114:55.17]What a great amount of content they've given me.
[114:57.08]Okay.
[115:08.89]Otto or Riot?
[115:09.92]No.
[115:10.28]That's what happened to Donkey Kong 64.
[115:24.66]You know, I'll be honest, I really didn't play Donkey Kong 64.
[115:27.52]Really at all.
[115:28.42]I really didn't.
[115:30.12]How did I miss that?
[115:33.70]Remember hearing the emergency broadcast thing?
[115:37.00]Like, this is a test of the emergency broadcasting system.
[115:39.18]Did you guys hear that?
[115:40.44]I did.
[115:41.85]It's weird.
[115:49.35]Fresh like a spring breeze.
[116:01.47]I know that they do that all the time to test it and everything, but holy shit if it doesn't scare the absolute hell out of you.
[116:08.37]I've been in the car before with like the radio on, and all of a sudden you're just like kind of, oh, the radio's just on this side.
[116:15.44]It's like, what the fuck happened?
[116:21.22]And then you're sitting there waiting, you're waiting, you're sitting, you're in the car, and you're out of red light, and you hear that like...
[116:30.62]And you're sitting there going, uh-oh, okay, what happened?
[116:33.58]And you're just kind of looking around, waiting to see a bunch of other cars just start fucking driving.
[116:38.68]That's how you know that they, like, got it first or something.
[116:40.58]They, like, they're hearing it, too.
[116:44.23]You're at a red light.
[116:44.95]You see, like, four cars just start speeding away.
[116:47.07]It's like, uh-oh, what's this?
[116:48.49]What's this gonna say?
[116:49.27]I get it.
[116:56.72]It shines.
[117:00.80]I think that they should really, before doing that, they should go like, excuse me, just want to let you know that there's about to be a test of the emergency broadcast system.
[117:11.55]Here it comes.
[117:14.61]I know, here it comes, right?
[117:21.87]I'm kind of going the wrong way, aren't I?
[117:27.90]They do it every time.
[117:29.38]No, no, no.
[117:29.76]They make the loud noise first, and then the guy comes on.
[117:34.82]They make the... And then the guy goes, hey, just letting you know, here comes his test.
[117:47.02]Where is the box?
[117:49.89]Back, box, idiot, idiot.
[117:51.13]Where is it, though?
[117:52.25]I don't remember where it is.
[117:53.13]Where is it?
[117:53.45]From here.
[117:55.13]Going the wrong way.
[117:55.75]I
[117:59.64]Play the actual sound.
[118:00.72]No, no, no.
[118:01.32]I'm not doing that.
[118:04.44]I think remember before, like... I don't think you could do that.
[118:09.50]Do it.
[118:09.68]No, no, no.
[118:09.90]I'm not doing it.
[118:10.54]No.
[118:13.46]Do it now.
[118:17.18]Why am I going to do that?
[118:18.28]I'm not going to play the emergency broadcast sound.
[118:25.83]Somebody will be in the bathroom.
[118:28.39]And somebody like went to go take a dump like fucking 30 minutes ago and they left the stream and now they turn it back on and they hear that.
[118:34.91]I don't want to do that.
[118:35.65]No.
[118:37.05]No, that's fucked up.
[118:37.77]I don't want to do that.
[118:44.25]Should I pick Patrick then?
[119:04.48]How did I miss this?
[119:09.60]I'm also disappointed that this is not... Hold on.
[119:16.41]Me, not you.
[119:18.05]I'm disappointed that this is not... Why would I be disappointed?
[119:20.29]I'm not going to say what I was going to say.
[119:27.45]Imagine only... Imagine only needing 30 minutes to dump.
[119:34.14]I'm not going to be known as the guy that just talks about going to the bathroom every stream.
[119:38.35]We need at least one in between where I don't do that.
[119:41.71]Lost.
[119:51.94]Super monster combo.
[119:54.00]I'm not going to do the Diablo 3 thing where it just does that every time, right?
[119:59.10]Remember that?
[120:03.05]Diablo 3 How cool that was the first like 2,000 times it said wow plus 200 experience bonus super ULTRAKILL How badly you just wanted to fucking turn that off and never say that ever again They never let you turn it off
[120:28.07]Diablo 3, by the way.
[120:28.91]I'm not talking about Diablo II.
[120:30.33]SpongeBob can jump up walls.
[120:32.17]Well, then why would I be Patrick?
[120:37.82]Sound like a broken man.
[120:40.69]Still been thinking about that setting I couldn't undo.
[120:43.07]I don't know why.
[120:44.81]I was supposed to say Mario 3.
[120:58.34]Yes, I know Spongebob can do it.
[120:59.66]Alright Spongebob, let's go.
[121:02.44]Cool.
[121:03.68]He doesn't care about the game he's playing.
[121:19.63]What are you talking about?
[121:21.07]I'm having a blast.
[121:22.07]I'm having a great time.
[121:24.14]And look, now I have ten... nine spatulas.
[121:29.38]Here it was again.
[121:41.56]Hold on a minute.

[122:45.35]Mm-hmm.
[123:05.83]Slap him!
[123:06.37]Uh, is any of this based on an episode or something?
[123:10.11]Are these based on episodes?
[123:15.01]That hurt.
[123:23.10]Then you gotta slap him in the head when you're almost dead.
[123:30.02]Wait, open this!

[127:49.44]I mean, look at that.
[127:51.06]Where does this go?
[127:51.76]Does this wrap around?

[129:13.17]No, no.
[129:14.87]I'm going to go check out the other zones.
[129:16.39]I don't want to stick in one area the whole time.
[129:20.41]Okay, please stop the music.
[129:23.33]But what if the music changes in the new area?
[129:27.51]See?
[129:28.05]Look, the music's already changed.
[129:35.65]Please stop.
[129:37.31]No.

[129:38.92]It's classic Spongebob music.
[129:40.66]Okay, this is... Alright, I have a question.
[129:45.14]Does it consume them, or do you just have to have them?
[129:48.43]Don't answer that.
[129:49.03]My question was already answered.

[131:23.19]That won't do any good.
[131:24.89]Why not?
[131:26.15]Because the robots have taken all the steering wheels.
[131:30.16]Couldn't we just drive in a straight line?

[133:57.67]Just get that person out of here.
[134:06.81]Nobody said that?
[134:07.37]Yes, they did.
[134:08.96]Scroll up.
[134:10.02]Scroll up!
[134:11.76]I mean, there's like over 9,000 people here.
[134:14.22]You're going to have to scroll up a little bit.
[134:28.50]I can.
[134:30.22]I thought I could hit it back.
[134:37.97]Why did I think I could hit it back?
[134:39.45]That's what I want to know.
[134:45.77]Please!
[134:46.23]Alright.
[134:52.44]Whatever.
[134:56.50]Can I jump on the lamps?
[134:59.36]What happened?
[135:00.36]Oh, he did it for me.
[135:01.66]Wait a minute.
[135:02.86]Oh.
[135:03.60]Well, that's neat.
[135:09.63]I gotta do that to all of them.
[135:11.37]One, two, three.
[135:12.15]Shoot it.
[135:20.53]Over here.
[135:23.69]Nice.
[135:27.94]Do it again.
[135:29.40]Nice.
[135:31.15]Bachelor.
[135:35.23]I love it.
[135:36.79]I love it.
[135:37.41]I'm going to die.
[135:50.93]Put on some pants.
[135:53.29]I'll get them.
[135:54.99]They're all over the place.
[135:55.87]I'll collect them.
[135:58.63]Is there a drivable car?
[135:59.97]Can I go over here?
[136:04.50]I already went over here.
[136:10.92]SpongeBob doesn't have a license.
[136:16.17]We see him driving around every episode.
[136:22.17]He's always driving around and crashing and stuff, isn't he?
[136:25.95]And isn't Mrs. Puff sitting there going like, SpongeBob, you need to do me a quick favor and hit the brake!
[136:32.47]Right?
[136:32.65]That happens all the time.
[136:36.60]This is like Cheese Puff SpongeBob.
[136:46.26]You can roll, but you can't do anything else.
[136:49.05]Being hurt or pressing any button will change you back
[136:54.82]What the hell?
[136:55.98]Well, let's try that again.
[136:59.40]What?
[137:24.49]What are they doing?
[137:35.00]Thank God for Gary.
[137:41.13]No, I want to be the SpongeBob.
[137:53.61]Can I read?
[137:54.77]This robot is called G. Love.
[137:56.53]The best way to deal with him is to bubble bounce him from above.
[138:01.05]Stop.
[138:01.45]I want to roll around.
[138:02.51]Whatever.
[138:07.15]I saved your life.
[138:10.99]Wait, did it again?
[138:11.49]That was awesome.
[138:19.10]That was such an awesome move.
[138:28.50]Alright, don't touch the red stuff.
[138:29.78]Okay.
[138:33.16]Is it hot sauce?
[138:35.26]Volcano sauce.
[138:37.36]Oop, there's a whale.
[138:40.28]Wait.
[138:40.48]How would I press this?
[138:45.94]I get through.
[138:47.12]Cool.
[138:47.66]Alright, cool.
[138:48.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[138:49.56]What do I do?
[138:49.94]Let's roll around and let them blow up.
[138:52.62]I think.
[138:58.68]I don't want to be the ball anymore.
[139:08.85]Stop hitting them, Jeremy.
[139:11.27]I know.
[139:11.55]I'm trying to listen.
[139:12.37]That was pretty sick.
[139:24.51]Oh, this bubble buggy.
[139:32.15]Psycho?
[139:35.45]Spongebob ice cream from the ice cream truck is the best ice cream.
[139:38.21]I agree.
[139:40.59]And that's not even what you said.
[139:41.56]I just said that after you.
[139:43.02]Ooh, wait.
[139:54.04]I want to get up there.
[139:56.06]Watch this.
[139:56.38]Watch this.
[139:56.68]Ready?
[139:56.84]Are you guys watching?
[139:57.42]Oh, wait.
[139:59.96]Don't watch this part.
[140:02.92]Can I go higher on the trampoline?
[140:12.83]I get that.
[140:17.22]From here.
[140:19.63]Hey VOD watchers, why don't you skip forward?
[140:21.73]Don't do that, you're gonna miss the best joke of the whole night!
[140:39.67]How does this go?
[140:50.25]fresh like a spring breeze what was the joke I didn't do it yet I just said if you skip most people when they skip they go like 20 minutes they go dunk dunk dunk dunk forward forward and they go 10 15 20 minutes forward you don't just go like 10 seconds forward who skips 10 seconds on like a more than three four five six hour bar
[141:31.97]Donk, donk, donk?
[141:36.95]I actually do.
[141:37.69]Alright, I've got 10k of these things.
[141:44.54]Can I dump them with the bag upside down at the bank?
[141:47.66]What do I do with these?
[141:54.48]Buy weapons.
[141:57.64]Oh, that's cool.
[142:02.39]Oh, give them to Mr. Krabs.
[142:04.47]I guess I really haven't explored completely the hub world, have I?
[142:07.15]Give them to Mr. Krabs.
[142:12.81]I will in a minute.
[142:27.01]You can open up areas with them.
[142:30.12]Oh.
[142:31.48]That's cool.
[142:36.34]I know how to get this open.
[142:37.70]Just make him angry.
[142:39.92]Aww.
[142:43.68]Alright, now where do I go from here?
[142:48.34]Kill this guy?
[142:53.89]I'm at the joke waiting room?
[142:56.52]Oh shit, alright.
[142:58.48]Okay, let's think here.
[142:59.28]Think quick.
[143:01.22]So... Um... Somebody said something about toothpaste, right?
[143:09.68]It's quick.
[143:10.04]Somebody said something about a toothbrush.
[143:11.36]A guy from the 1700s having a toothpaste with sand in his mouth.
[143:14.68]Somebody do something like that, quick.
[143:18.43]I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[143:21.39]You'll have to open this door...
[143:24.12]How do I get up there?
[143:24.72]Open this door from the inside.
[143:28.38]Well, how do I do that?
[143:33.19]Go back?
[143:33.89]Back?
[143:34.81]Wait a minute.
[143:40.97]What?
[143:41.23]That's all it did?
[143:41.71]It just closed the door?
[143:42.88]It closed the... No, it just closes the door.
[143:50.46]It closed the window.
[143:51.30]Oh.
[143:56.48]I thought that was it.
[143:57.26]I thought I was ready.
[144:00.00]Be the ball.
[144:03.95]Hmm.
[144:05.75]Let's go be the ball.
[144:12.97]Okay, I am ball.
[144:15.41]That's 2100 fucking points.
[144:17.75]That's worth it, right?
[144:18.50]2100?
[144:18.66]That's a lot.
[144:19.48]What did I get?
[144:25.04]There's nothing in here.
[144:26.94]There was nothing in there.
[144:27.86]Oh.
[144:35.87]It opened the gate.
[144:38.85]Bod Watchers skip.
[144:41.17]No, no, no.
[144:41.63]I'll know if you skip.
[144:42.57]I'll know if you skip.
[144:45.85]I'll jot it down.
[144:46.59]I'll know who did it.
[145:12.21]That's like the equivalent of okay, how many times per minute do you guys think that somebody types into Google?
[145:22.20]Does somebody know if I unfollow them?
[145:27.42]Does somebody know if they see your- Does somebody know if you see their tweet?
[145:32.72]How many times a second do you think that's typed into Google?
[145:48.23]If I have read receipts off, will people still know I saw their text?
[145:53.00]Oh, that's the entrance to the rooftops, which leads to the lighthouse?
[145:57.54]Oh, there's another golden spatula.
[146:00.20]I could really use that.
[146:05.81]Quick rewind.
[146:09.13]What do you mean get Sandy to help me?
[146:12.35]I can get through this.
[146:13.29]Sandy.
[146:16.67]Oh, that gap looks big.
[146:19.43]Okay, I'm definitely not making that jump.
[146:22.38]How is anyone going to get across there?
[146:26.57]New character?
[146:27.73]Where's Sandy?
[146:30.56]I don't know where Sandy lives.
[146:32.56]Ah, shit.
[146:33.00]I need to have watched the show.
[146:35.88]Ah, fuck.
[147:08.46]No, I actually don't know.
[147:11.72]I know that SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are neighbors.
[147:16.54]I don't know where Sandy lives.
[147:18.63]I know that she's in a dome somewhere.
[147:21.15]Did she just get off the bus?
[147:37.42]Okay.
[147:38.16]Well, that makes it way easier.
[147:39.76]Alright.
[147:44.46]Let's go jump to the top of these steps.
[147:49.00]Sandy can glide across the gap to the next rooftop by double jumping and holding A. Nice.
[147:59.86]I don't think I'll ever not play with Sandy.
[148:06.41]Double jump and a glide.
[148:07.47]Oh, wait.
[148:14.23]I... I love it.
[148:24.58]I love the jump, too.
[148:26.16]The jump looks exactly like those... It's a toy.
[148:30.58]There's a toy.
[148:31.50]I don't know what it is.
[148:32.62]What toy is this?
[148:33.30]It's like a little string and you pull the string up from the top of the head and all the legs and arms come up and down.
[148:38.32]What am I talking about?
[148:40.20]What is it?
[148:45.38]An old wooden toy.
[148:46.68]It's a toy that's like wood.
[148:50.19]It's a depression era toy.
[148:51.59]Yes.
[148:52.01]What is it called?
[148:52.63]It's called a barrel man.
[149:00.15]Are you lying?
[149:10.84]No, this is not... What the... This is not it.
[149:12.92]No.
[149:13.26]It's a wooden toy that has string and legs and arms move up.
[149:21.10]What is this thing?
[149:25.24]Jumping Jack.
[149:25.80]There it is.
[149:26.72]Thank you.
[149:28.68]It's like a... Yeah.
[149:29.52]Okay.
[149:35.12]Yeah, it goes like this.
[149:41.28]Don't leave.
[149:42.95]You're hovering over the X. No, just stay.
[149:47.59]It's okay, alright?
[149:51.15]You're just like, you were about to click, and I stopped you.
[149:55.58]Just wait, skip 10 seconds.
[150:04.08]Hey, what's up?
[150:05.70]Just want to make sure that you actually did what I told you to do.
[150:08.94]Now, if you want to be cool, and we can be like, you know, we're like a big community here, I'd like you to skip an hour and ten minutes.
[150:19.07]And I'll see you there for a secret surprise.
[150:21.65]Skip an hour and ten minutes.
[150:33.54]It's gonna be fun.
[150:35.46]At that exact time, that would be 3... It would be 3.42.
[150:44.32]3.42.
[150:44.90]Alright, where am I going from here?
[150:52.82]Right here.
[151:01.29]We can't skip when it's live.
[151:02.31]This isn't for you.
[151:04.89]This is for the VOD watchers.
[151:13.74]Wait, does she have something... Sandy can do a chop attack by pressing X. If you chop while in the air, you will perform a karate kick.
[151:27.09]Okay.
[151:31.69]Cool.
[151:38.29]Wait, what?
[151:38.69]Sandy can lasso the object by pressing B. So, tutorial, what you're telling me is Sandy is the best character in the game and just has every awesome move.
[151:57.58]Sandy can swing from a swing hook by pressing B.
[152:06.33]I don't like it.
[152:08.57]It didn't say hold B. It said press B. It said press B, not hold B. Press B, not hey hold it.
[152:22.35]It didn't say that.
[152:23.41]Now what do I do now?
[152:32.84]Can she turn into a ball?
[152:35.70]Shit.
[152:43.05]Wait.
[152:43.67]Blow this up.
[152:53.57]That makes me so mad I want to, like, leave the level.
[152:55.89]Fuck.
[152:57.00]I can't.
[153:03.07]glitch the game mode to get that one.
[153:04.33]It's right over there, you baby.
[153:13.62]Is it?
[153:14.60]Did you just call me baby?
[153:18.28]What else can I get with this?
[153:24.71]Lion Squirrel coming through!
[153:45.73]You enjoy Halo.
[153:48.35]Yeah.
[153:51.85]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[153:55.37]Alright, I'm paying attention now.
[153:57.41]Everyone's yelling at me.
[153:59.56]Where's the trampoline?
[154:00.32]Remember, you're just crying.
[154:16.20]You're crying.
[154:21.13]Podwatcher, skip whole stream.
[154:29.43]How would you do that?
[154:30.09]The stream is sick!
[154:34.41]There we are.
[154:50.07]Alright, we're back.
[154:53.03]Which way is correct?
[154:54.34]Which is the right way?
[154:58.28]The stream is infected.
[154:59.42]Oh, it isn't.
[155:08.93]Okay.
[155:10.09]So again, hold it.
[155:15.33]Ooh, that's actually kind of fun.
[155:17.71]He's got it under control.
[155:18.75]Sandy can lasso a robot by pressing B. Sandy's the best.
[155:25.93]Watch out, explodes!
[155:47.28]Checkpoint now.
[155:49.40]Where do I go from here is the question.
[155:51.93]We've got the whole area.
[155:53.43]Oh boy.
[156:03.50]There we are.
[156:04.40]Yes!
[156:05.38]Is this a fake Sandy?
[156:09.54]I don't think it is.
[156:10.04]I think this is real.
[156:25.27]I will destroy this, though.
[156:28.37]Just get out of here.
[156:29.29]And I'll get one of these.
[156:29.95]Five.
[156:40.18]Uh... Well... Anything else I can do from here?
[156:52.22]Go into the tuba?
[156:58.80]Holy shit, you can.
[157:00.94]No, you can't.
[157:01.60]Oh, damn it.
[157:02.90]I thought you could.
[157:03.46]Honestly.
[157:06.62]That was cool.
[157:09.62]And Sandy's best character in the whole game, so.
[157:12.10]I've unlocked Sandy.
[157:14.68]You just press R. I thought you went in.
[157:30.47]Hey, Larry.
[157:31.01]What's shakin'?
[157:31.77]Sandy!
[157:32.59]Boy, am I glad to see you.
[157:34.33]I need your help.
[157:35.39]My TV reception has been terrible lately.
[157:38.09]I need to have someone replace my old antenna with this shiny new one.
[157:42.95]So call cable company.
[157:44.99]Yes, sir.
[157:45.71]That there antenna is shinier than a $3 bill.
[157:48.95]Well, why don't you replace it yourself?
[157:51.92]I'm not really much of a jumper.
[157:56.83]So what's jumping got to do with it?
[157:58.81]Because the old antenna is up there.
[158:00.99]That's taller than a glass of Texas iced tea.
[158:10.85]Which is gross, by the way.
[158:11.81]I just want to make sure I make my opinion on that very well heard.
[158:15.13]The robots have blocked off that building and I can't do all those fancy moves you and SpongeBob do to get across these gaps.
[158:22.45]All I can do is flex.
[158:24.41]Want to see?
[158:27.09]I fucking hate iced tea with tons of sugar in it.
[158:28.95]I hate it.
[158:29.25]There's a lot- sweet tea can get to a point where it's like syrup.
[158:35.46]It's not even a drink.
[158:38.96]Like you could pour sweet tea over pancakes and that would be okay.
[158:42.96]That's a lot.
[159:10.12]Sandy may cross large gaps by double jumping and holding A. Yeah, I know.
[159:15.99]Anything over here?
[159:18.61]No.
[159:18.97]Toilet paper?
[159:21.33]Keeny Bottom Motor Company.
[159:29.88]I like iced tea.
[159:30.88]I like iced tea that's sweet with sugar in it.
[159:33.76]The sweet tea is at a whole nother level.
[159:36.54]It's just... It's just too much.
[159:46.65]I should... I just killed that person.
[159:51.04]Swing... Wait, what does it say?
[159:52.86]Hey, I can't even... I'm trying to read.
[159:54.80]Swing from... Swing from swing... I know.
[159:59.64]I stopped saying that.
[160:00.42]I know how to do this.
[160:03.80]This is a funny cartoon.
[160:09.66]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[160:18.37]What?
[160:18.55]Hold on.
[160:19.29]You're putting on Spongebob's underwear?
[160:21.45]I don't know about that.
[160:51.23]Shit, why does everything explode?
[161:04.98]Ooh, almost fucked it up, but I'm there.
[161:14.52]I like that guy.
[161:17.34]That's my favorite character in SpongeBob.
[161:19.82]I think so.
[161:24.33]Here, twenty one hundred dollars!
[161:28.47]That seems like a lot.
[161:30.17]What is this gonna open?
[161:32.55]Rebuild the bridge.
[161:36.65]Oh.
[161:36.75]Uh.
[161:38.66]Oh, I have no- Holy shit, I almost missed it.
[161:48.20]Oh, what the fuck happened?! !
[162:06.64]Hey, that guy just grabbed me.
[162:08.06]That was... Maybe there's no reason for that.
[162:10.34]See those baits right there?
[162:17.81]That's bullshit.
[162:21.51]Just do it.
[162:21.95]Just kill me.
[162:26.24]How did I miss that?
[162:46.20]I don't know why, I just picture somebody sitting at their computer right now like... Like just laughing at me.
[162:54.97]Give me the fucking thing!
[163:03.24]What, did I win?
[163:03.98]Did I get what I needed to get?
[163:06.74]I didn't.
[163:09.62]I need to get the antenna.
[163:12.73]I get the box though, right?
[163:26.28]That was just for the bonus.
[163:28.16]Oh, well.
[163:31.69]Did I miss a box?

[164:16.46]You're all just fracking the fuck up.

[170:03.46]That was the checkpoint from Cruisin' USA.
[170:05.24]Yeah, it was.
[170:07.08]You were incredibly perceptive.
[170:11.76]And just because you got that, I'll give you my best intro.

[171:59.40]You know, thank you.
[172:02.52]That means a lot.
[172:04.60]That means that this, you don't think, wasn't prepared for that.
[172:14.33]That means that there's only like six hours worth of fringe stop going on this trampoline!
[172:19.52]I have to do it again.
[172:44.89]What would that even look like?
[172:46.07]I really want to know.
[172:48.99]Part of me wants to know what that looks like.
[172:50.68]There's a lot to go through though.
[173:17.94]Have people make cringe compilation videos of me and watch them?
[173:23.78]I feel like that's levels of self-deprecation.
[173:26.10]I'm not sure I want to cross.
[173:27.38]Do you know what I mean?
[173:29.90]Like, that's like... Oh, hey guys, let's watch the most cringey, shitty things I've ever done.
[173:36.40]Isn't that funny?
[173:37.00]I don't know.
[173:45.06]Maybe.
[173:51.79]So what is this?

[175:05.35]So this must be how you open up the door.
[175:07.41]This isn't that hard.
[175:15.52]No.
[175:17.02]Fun.
[175:31.89]This game hits a huge difficulty spike after the real first boss.
[175:36.05]Didn't I fight the first boss already?
[175:46.10]Wasn't the first boss the squid?
[175:50.12]Oh, that was a mini boss.

[176:28.10]Don't forget the button.
[176:33.04]I'm just making sure that I get this.
[176:34.32]I don't want to hit this button and teleport out.
[176:53.66]Doesn't do anything.
[176:54.36]It was a sock?
[176:55.42]Wait, what was there?
[176:56.86]Did I miss a sock?
[177:25.10]It was a trampoline.
[177:26.36]Oh, shit.
[177:28.54]I hit it and then I didn't notice anything immediately and I looked over chat and somebody said nothing.
[177:32.93]Two people said like, nothing, nothing, LOL.
[177:34.59]And I'm like, okay, it must be nothing.
[177:36.03]Two people said it.

[178:24.93]The antenna.
[178:38.49]I like jumping around.
[178:44.16]It's a lot of fun.
[178:46.52]It makes me feel happy.
[178:53.34]I would have just jumped into the box.

[180:59.01]So, do you want to trade shiny objects for a golden spatula?
[181:03.32]Yeah.
[181:03.50]That's quality craftsmanship, though.
[181:08.65]Can I do it again?
[181:13.16]Yes.
[181:13.66]Well, I don't know.
[181:19.80]I have less than a thousand bucks.
[181:21.02]I wonder how many times you can do that.
[181:23.28]Alright, I'm going to the Poseidon.
[181:35.27]Yeah, 126,000 for all those.
[181:36.19]Holy shit.
[181:36.63]This is the real first boss.
[181:38.45]Oh shit, I gotta sit up then.
[182:00.19]Whoa, wait for the bounce.
[182:27.14]What bounce?
[182:30.08]Like that.
[182:31.50]And then in the head?
[182:33.52]I get it.
[182:35.08]I know what to do.
[182:38.63]I don't.
[182:39.39]I don't get it.
[182:39.75]I don't know what to do.
[182:40.31]I don't understand.
[182:46.77]Oh, that's the bounce.
[182:48.37]What the fuck is that?

[183:10.89]Looks like the robots left its cell phone.
[183:17.15]Oh, that's got a sting.
[183:21.48]That was a good joke, bad execution, because I was trying to pay attention to the boss.
[183:26.66]That was slowly, that was slow to come out.
[183:28.81]Get out of here, you... bad... self... notification.
[183:34.63]Oh, watch out for Sandy.
[183:35.69]I'll get it.

[185:38.73]Oh, wow.
[185:46.79]The robots losing its head.
[185:48.67]Now it's Sandy's turn.
[185:52.64]This is the last phase coming up.
[185:57.40]How does Jerma manage to read some comments?
[186:04.99]That's how Jerma manages to not know where he's standing half the time.
[186:11.91]So Jerma gets to the same spot he's been to three times.
[186:15.93]And doesn't remember he was there.
[186:27.02]Wait.
[186:27.54]Oh, I got a hit right in the chin.
[186:33.11]He's talking in third person again.
[186:34.61]Mom, he's talking in third person again.
[186:49.22]Not the top rope.
[186:50.58]Not the top rope.

[187:56.93]Oh, thank you.
[187:58.01]It all means so much.
[187:59.10]That's pretty PogChamp.
[188:02.96]I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[188:04.68]Cry all you want.
[188:06.60]But not here.
[188:07.92]We just wax the floors.
[188:11.44]Still says the whole thing.
[188:12.50]Still says the whole thing.
[188:15.26]Fucking idiot.
[188:17.94]Hey, Plankton.
[188:22.00]yes what is it I was just wondering why all the robots seem to be coming from inside the chum bucket where the subtitles are they're they're right here have they I really haven't noticed uh yeah and then there's that big flashing neon sign that says robot headquarters spongebob I'm your friend right
[188:55.16]No, not really.
[188:56.86]I was waiting for someone to say it.
[188:58.88]Exactly.
[188:59.54]And as your non-friend... I dropped like a few... I dropped 300 frames just real quick and I was waiting for... Oh, Fiverr.
[189:05.69]Like F Fiverr.
[189:07.03]He's got Fiverr.
[189:08.27]Laugh out loud.
[189:13.72]Tell you what I'm gonna do.
[189:15.62]I'm gonna think for you.
[189:17.22]This way you won't hurt yourself.
[189:19.00]And you can just keep working on getting me into the jump bucket.
[189:25.35]He said, don't stop using a VPN.
[189:27.15]It's snake oil.
[189:28.95]Don't you understand?
[189:32.33]I've committed to a point where it has to be real.
[189:36.95]I've committed to a point where it needs to be real.
[189:49.54]Very cool.
[189:51.96]That was just a single boss fight, huh?
[189:54.92]Oh, wait.
[189:56.13]This is where she lives.
[189:59.73]She's that close?
[190:00.79]I thought she lived like in another city.
[190:04.53]Wait.
[190:05.35]This is blowing my mind.
[190:06.61]Sandy lived right here?
[190:11.57]Like right down the street?
[190:13.33]I thought she lived like 10 to 20 miles away.
[190:22.90]Holy shit.
[190:27.88]This isn't canon?
[190:29.70]Are you ready, kids?
[190:31.70]Let's go!
[190:58.42]Oh no, he turned it from Spongebob into Spongebob.
[191:02.97]Hold on, I don't want to lose.
[191:04.89]That's a long time.
[191:05.77]Never mind.
[191:06.57]Make as many jokes as you want, Jeremy.
[191:09.39]Talking in third person again.
[191:16.66]Thinks he's talking to himself somehow.
[191:18.78]I don't know what he's doing.
[191:28.66]go for an oh tartar sauce loud maybe when I get maybe later
[191:59.18]That was the easiest spatula of the whole game.
[192:05.40]Wait, isn't this where the... I don't need it.
[192:07.50]I don't need it.
[192:08.88]I definitely don't need it.
[192:11.26]He's sitting right here, right?
[192:12.50]He's like, I don't need it.
[192:13.62]I don't need it.
[192:17.45]I need it!
[192:19.25]He freaks out.
[192:20.11]I don't know what happens after that.
[192:27.13]All I know is I've seen the gif like a thousand times.
[192:30.18]I don't know what happens after that.
[192:31.04]I've never seen the episode.
[192:32.56]SpongeBob's a cool little guy, ain't he?
[192:36.82]Can I do anything else in here?
[192:44.93]Of course I've seen the episode.
[192:46.11]Can I go actually in the tree?
[193:05.75]Let me teach you how to bowl a bubble.
[193:07.98]Press this button and you'll bowl a bubble that can knock down robots from a safe distance.
[193:13.84]Wow.
[193:14.68]Really?
[193:15.06]Remember though, the bubble bowl only works on things that are close to the ground.
[193:20.72]Got it.
[193:23.98]Remember the joke.
[193:25.40]It's 3.42, guys.
[193:26.78]I know what it was.
[193:27.54]3.42.
[193:27.56]It's in like 30 minutes.

[194:08.09]Golden spatulas to enter... to unlock.
[194:12.45]Dirty.
[194:18.37]Why don't we do that?
[194:22.25]Did I get hit by that?
[194:25.65]Ow.

[198:54.78]Well, go over to the couch to access the Mermalair.
[198:57.54]Mermalair?
[198:57.90]We'll meet you down there.
[198:58.88]Wait, there's a whole Mermalair?
[198:59.91]Is it morning night yet?
[199:00.87]Mermalair?
[199:14.48]You're a fake fan.
[199:17.82]Ten minutes have not passed.
[199:19.78]No, it has not.
[199:30.60]Over to the couch and we'll go to the mermaid lair.
[199:35.75]Wait, we can watch TV?
[199:36.55]Aww, I thought we could watch an episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[199:42.93]The proprietor, Plankton, has released the following statement.
[199:48.82]What's his shoe size?
[199:50.18]Uh, 13.
[199:50.88]Hear me now!
[199:52.80]I'll crush you all beneath my... And now, back to your regular programming, Retirement Home Girls Gone Wild!
[200:11.36]That's not what... That's... What the fuck are you watching, man?
[200:24.57]Enter the Mermalair.
[200:28.57]Uh, yeah.
[200:32.75]It's everybody's dream to go to the Mermalair.
[200:47.71]Wait, what's going on down here?
[200:50.99]This looks corrupted.
[200:59.16]Alright, I don't- I'm gonna die.
[201:09.31]I've already done it like twice, I don't need to do it again.
[201:17.85]You shouldn't sneak up on Mermaid Man like that.
[201:20.27]His heart's not so good.
[201:22.07]Come to think of it, nothing on him is that good anymore.
[201:24.99]Sorry, Mermaid Man.
[201:26.35]It's just that I'm always so excited to see you two.
[201:28.98]Standing in your awesome presence gives me the chills of justice.
[201:32.64]See?
[201:33.20]I've got goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my... Alright, kid.
[201:39.10]Knock it off.
[201:39.74]Just tell us what you want.
[201:41.01]What a great character.
[201:42.21]Well, I really want a new pair of sunglasses.
[201:44.47]Patrick's sad on my old ones.
[201:46.92]That's not what I meant.
[201:50.27]Actually, it's a good thing you showed up, young sponge of goodness.
[201:56.53]It is?
[201:57.67]It is.
[201:59.15]Yes, a bunch of evil robots have taken over the Bermalair security system.
[202:08.22]It's up to you to shut it down and stop them.
[202:14.62]Well, why him?
[202:15.90]We're perfectly capable superheroes.
[202:18.34]Because it's Thursday and we have a whole... Because it's Thursday and we have a whole bunch of doctor's appointments.
[202:28.43]Ah, fish sticks.
[202:29.63]I forgot.
[202:32.15]Go talk to the mobile air computer in the next room.
[202:36.59]She'll tell you what you need to do.
[202:39.91]I accept this awesome responsibility, Mermaid Man.
[202:42.95]You won't be disappointed.
[202:46.51]to the doctor's office away!
[202:50.70]Did somebody just say, LOL, Bernie Sanders?
[203:05.85]Why is every voice Bernie?
[203:08.43]That wasn't Bernie Sanders.
[203:10.67]That wasn't even close.
[203:13.83]Oh, LOL, there's another Bernie.
[203:17.86]Everybody's not burning.
[203:19.24]Oh, I'm gonna die!
[203:32.49]Bernie, LOL, you normie loser.
[203:34.61]What the fuck is going on here?
[203:38.61]Wait, don't- let me read this!
[203:45.54]Don't step on the red squares off the disco floor.
[203:50.70]Why not?
[203:55.20]Wait, hold on.
[203:56.38]Let me process what... Let me just... Let me process what... Did you say that Bernie was normie?
[204:14.67]What?
[204:15.11]What?
[204:21.60]I'm trying to figure out what that means.
[204:23.08]Get out of here.
[204:51.55]Gotta hit him back.
[204:55.12]You missed that one.
[204:57.06]Try another!
[205:11.73]You're in such a shitty spot.
[205:13.01]Just get out of here!
[205:28.20]so bad why am I trying no you're right I'm gonna let that one stick here because I'm trying to knock them back at him bounce them like throw them back at him and it worked a couple times so I was like oh that's just what I'm supposed to do so yeah I don't I don't yeah
[205:52.04]Wait, can I spin this?
[205:53.94]You can use Bubble Bowl to turn paddle wheels.
[205:56.48]Bowl one side of this paddle to make it turn.
[206:07.31]It's been making that up.
[206:09.59]Okay, it wants me to go this way.
[206:15.57]Can I turn this on?
[206:25.93]Your chair is about to break.
[206:34.35]Fifteen minutes until it's funny.
[206:37.77]This is going to be like a... Oh, damn it.
[206:47.96]Shit.
[206:48.66]It's still possible.
[206:51.38]Is it though?
[206:52.26]No, it's not.
[206:52.69]Fuck.
[206:54.11]Fuck.
[206:54.72]Fuck!
[206:55.92]Important.
[206:56.34]This is very important.
[206:57.42]Seriously, this is the most important thing in the whole stream.
[206:59.10]We only have a few minutes to do this.
[207:00.75]I need somebody to go back to, like, uh, I need somebody to go back to the first, like, fucking 40 minutes of the stream.
[207:07.15]And I need something, I need to, I need to, I need something that I said that I can use as, like, a puzzle for the VOD watchers when I say, Hey, welcome!
[207:14.24]Hey, VOD watchers!
[207:15.20]Here you are.
[207:16.20]Okay.
[207:16.98]I need you to go back.
[207:18.92]And we need to get the secret code from one hour and 41 minutes.
[207:24.12]Right?
[207:24.30]Okay.
[207:27.58]If you can decipher the code, meet me at 4 hours and 22 seconds.
[207:31.28]You know what I mean?
[207:32.28]Let's make like a fucking stupid game for the Blood Watchers.
[207:35.18]I need like a one line that I can refer back to at 3.42.
[207:40.04]I need an exact time period for this as well.
[207:47.35]I'm not clicking that.
[207:50.89]It has to be something that was like at least two hours ago.
[207:55.78]Colgate thing?
[207:57.36]What was the exact time for Colgate?
[208:05.54]Okay, like, if you can... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[208:11.00]Like, go... Hey, guys, go back.
[208:15.28]Go back to one hour and 42 minutes, and if you can find me a certain name...
[208:23.67]That will decipher.
[208:24.65]No, it's got to be... Dave Colgate, right?
[208:28.75]D is A, B, C. That's three.
[208:31.57]A would be one.
[208:33.49]That's three, one.
[208:34.65]Shit.
[208:35.11]Doesn't work out.
[208:39.25]I need something that... Damn it.
[208:44.15]A, B, C. D is four.
[208:45.31]Fuck, D is four.
[208:45.97]D is not three.
[208:47.55]Okay, that works.
[208:49.03]That's four.
[208:49.60]One.
[208:50.72]One.
[208:53.40]So V would be 24 hours and 12 minutes.
[209:02.30]E, A, B, C, D, E. Four hours, 10, 12 minutes and five seconds.
[209:13.49]Because then four hours and 12 minutes, it's like, hey, you solved the puzzle.
[209:22.95]How can you say so much without saying anything?
[209:26.95]Somebody, alright, let me pause this.
[209:29.77]I want the Dave Colgate to be what I tell them to go back to.
[209:34.84]And then when they get the Dave, they need to figure out the secret code to find the time frame to skip to.
[209:41.40]Because the Dave would be the code, would be the time in the VOD.
[209:48.63]That's what I'm saying.
[209:53.50]Yes, Dave equals the time.
[209:55.34]Like, for the VOD.
[209:58.00]And, like, ABCD would be for the fourth letter of the alphabet, so that's hour four.
[210:02.56]You understand what I'm saying?
[210:17.62]Wait, A would be one... How are you not getting the corresponding... What are you talking about?
[210:23.22]You have four... Somebody got it.
[210:26.14]Four, one, two, two, fives.
[210:32.49]Four hours.
[210:33.15]Okay, so in minutes and seconds.
[210:46.74]That's 4-12-25.
[210:47.16]Yes.
[210:47.64]Alright.
[210:48.14]Okay.
[210:48.68]What was the exact time frame that I started talking about Dave Colgate?
[210:55.32]1-14-32?
[210:55.46]I need an exact time.
[211:16.51]Look at this place.
[211:17.87]I mean, please.
[211:19.31]Would it kill them to lay down a few crow rods?
[211:21.73]Oh, that's easy.
[211:22.85]In episode 27, the Mermalair is invaded by the digging monsters of Bermuda and... Never mind.
[212:00.16]What is he doing here?
[212:05.29]What?
[212:05.85]What do you mean worst joke 2020?
[212:07.13]It didn't even happen yet.
[212:08.53]Can I bowl this?
[212:28.91]I have to be Patrick for this.
[212:30.09]Where's the boss?
[212:50.13]I've got a job for somebody who can throw things.
[212:54.57]Actually, it really isn't that good.
[212:55.71]I'm great at throwing things.
[212:59.58]All you have to do is pick up a throw fruit and throw it into each of those funnel machines.
[213:08.68]No, throw the throw fruit.
[213:12.62]No, I'm not doing it.
[213:16.82]Your wife is still putting in a fucking image.
[213:26.63]Woo, up we go.
[213:32.47]Hey!
[213:33.11]What the fuck?
[213:36.40]Oh, the 10 minute cooldown ended right, right, right.
[213:43.32]If Colgate bit starts at 58 minutes in the VOD... Okay.
[213:53.69]Shit.
[213:57.45]Hold on, I have to beat this part!
[214:05.83]What the hell?
[214:21.74]What?
[214:27.84]Got it.
[214:37.81]It's not on a timer, right?
[214:39.35]No.
[214:41.35]Alright, hold on.
[214:42.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[214:46.84]5740 is exactly where it starts, alright.
[214:50.16]Steakums.
[214:51.48]This is... Okay, I'm gonna show this just because I want... I... Why do I have to... Why would I show this?
[215:06.87]I'm going to, but like, why would I do this?
[215:12.75]By the way, good luck getting your steakums to look like that and be like that.
[215:18.07]It's very hard to do.
[215:18.82]Okay, let's do it again.
[215:33.24]This one's going to be the hard one.
[215:48.07]Nevermind, it's not that hard.
[215:50.27]That wasn't that hard.
[215:54.13]This one you just walk.
[216:01.65]Alright.
[216:11.76]Mermaid man, now what?
[216:21.82]Well, for a joke that sucks so bad, it seems like a whole lot of you can't wait for it to happen.
[216:27.80]You did it!
[216:29.64]Now I can get some sleep.
[216:37.23]Give me that spatula.
[217:00.28]Incoming worst joke of the year.
[217:01.76]No, stop.
[217:03.16]You're getting in my head.
[217:08.66]Holy shit, this is a huge... This goes way up.
[217:15.66]I'm going to stick with SpongeBob.
[217:39.58]There's nothing like the smell of bubbles in the morning.
[217:42.48]It smells like victory.
[218:00.79]Just don't get knocked off.
[218:05.68]I couldn't have stayed in Patrick.
[218:08.02]That is not how that works.
[218:14.06]Wait, is there a dog?
[218:15.56]Why is this guy a dog?
[218:35.62]That guy was making dog sounds.
[218:45.91]Okay.
[218:46.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[218:52.42]What the hell was that?
[218:58.06]Is this a slide?
[218:59.02]It is a slide.
[218:59.80]I got it.
[219:02.75]Got the purple one.
[219:11.67]Whoa.
[219:13.47]Bridge activated.
[219:15.17]Nice.
[219:15.43]I got the bridge activated.
[219:24.64]I can destroy this.
[219:28.14]Oh!
[219:28.98]Shit.
[219:46.51]Move, move, move, move.
[219:51.90]Watch out for that.
[219:52.80]I don't want to get hit by that.
[219:56.62]I don't want to... I've got to stand here for a second.
[219:58.16]I don't want to get... The dude's going to come over here, and he's going to... Hey, what's going on, VOD Watcher?
[220:03.86]Welcome.
[220:04.79]You made it to the third step of the puzzle.
[220:08.09]Now, the trickiest part of the entire game so far is you're going to have to go back...
[220:14.09]back to the beginning, at least somewhere in the first hour.
[220:17.66]And you're going to need to find the name that was set.
[220:21.82]It was a first and last name that was set.
[220:24.64]And once you figure that out, you're going to have to go to the timestamp that you can decipher the code for the timestamp from that name.
[220:34.04]And if you can figure it out, you're going to find yourself a prize.
[220:39.17]Good luck.
[220:53.75]Not gonna give him the f- You think I'm gonna give him the time?
[220:55.97]No.
[220:59.09]Telling him, hey, go to, go to fifth- They might still be here.
[221:02.90]Get out of here.
[221:04.46]Go do the puzzle.
[221:05.48]Don't stick around here.
[221:06.58]Don't go do the puzzle.
[221:08.72]Get the fuck out of here.
[221:13.34]Go.
[221:13.88]Alright.
[221:26.65]I'm like if I say the exact time then it defeats the purpose of the puzzle Alright, so it What if this still here I can't even say the time I Can't say the actual okay.
[221:46.48]I Wait, there's no more VODs, right?
[221:49.60]There's no more VOD chat anymore, right?
[221:51.08]Oh
[221:56.51]There is.
[221:57.71]Shit.
[221:58.35]Oh, fuck!
[222:00.72]Can I turn the chat off of VODs?
[222:06.66]How do I climb this?
[222:23.23]VOD chat stopped a year ago.
[222:25.05]Wait, but it did it?
[222:32.80]I missed a button.
[222:33.82]Shit!
[222:42.07]No, it didn't.
[222:43.85]I just can't type in it anymore.
[222:53.88]Don't delete the bot!
[223:13.95]I just canned the whole thing.
[223:15.09]Fuck it.
[223:15.42]It didn't work out.
[223:20.86]Hey, by the way, the prize, I'm just gonna fucking scream in my room at the exact second.
[223:28.66]I know the exact time.
[223:29.58]I'm gonna just stand up back there and I'm just gonna scream like into the wall.
[223:34.80]At the exact second that it happened.
[223:37.66]You just met the Sponginator.
[223:43.29]Okay, I need to hit that.
[223:47.32]Fuck!
[223:47.74]I thought I could make it.
[224:13.22]Play copyrighted music so the VOD gets muted.
[224:18.86]I can't go back to the stream from like an hour ago and play copyrighted music.
[224:22.96]Oh, that was such a huge brain thing to do when we were talking about it.
[224:28.32]God damn it.
[224:29.36]What a huge brain thing.
[224:31.32]I could have put on... I could have put on the copyrighted music while we were talking about it.
[224:45.58]Oh well.
[224:47.66]Just redo it.
[224:48.72]Well at least the people in the archive channel can have fun.
[225:15.31]I really should have been paying attention to what that said.
[225:31.35]Can you say it again?
[225:34.65]Okay.
[225:35.81]Press all of them.
[225:47.56]Is there another one that I didn't get?
[225:49.14]Press the master shutdown button to lower the bridge to the villain containment system.
[226:08.90]Next time?
[226:09.94]Yeah.
[226:10.14]Yeah.
[226:19.12]Oh, you took the elevator.
[226:21.22]How do I get to the top of this room?
[226:23.47]Meow.
[226:24.99]You're right.
[226:26.09]I bet those tunnels will take me up to the top.
[226:28.63]Good thinking, Gary.
[226:41.98]I love opening presents.
[226:44.02]Link, okay.
[226:44.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[226:45.02]Alright.
[226:45.50]What is it?
[226:47.47]Give me the good one.
[226:48.03]Give me the one that everybody wants me to click on.
[226:49.57]Give me the good one.
[226:56.53]I don't know.
[226:56.90]I don't think this is it.
[227:01.94]I just clicked on one that I don't... I think that is wrong.
[227:10.40]Dermapatric.
[227:15.42]Okay, this is good.
[227:16.98]This is worth it.
[227:19.00]This is actually worth keeping on, by the way, for a while.
[227:21.76]This is the wrong one?
[227:40.49]How could that be wrong?
[227:47.68]It's great.
[227:48.30]These are both good.
[228:18.52]Hold on, did I just see Jeremiah Patrick deep fake?
[228:24.40]You can't deep fake my face onto Patrick's face.
[228:27.34]That's not how it works.
[228:34.20]You can't do that.
[228:37.20]Can somebody do it?
[228:38.16]Can somebody deep fake me onto Patrick?
[228:45.53]Somebody has to try.
[228:48.64]Even if it looks like shit.
[229:00.81]You guys are just like adding people.
[229:08.94]Do not underestimate the power of the chat.
[229:18.99]Yeah, that's right.
[229:21.65]Anytime you underestimate chat, it comes back to bite you.
[229:25.99]Click on the actual Imgur link.
[229:39.90]Why am I Patrick?
[229:44.12]In all of these.
[229:54.71]I wonder.
[230:01.62]Patrick's a moron.
[230:03.22]That's what it is, right?
[230:15.38]Okay.
[230:16.54]Let's continue.
[230:18.23]It shines.
[230:32.20]Patrick is a fan favorite.
[230:33.64]He's my fan favorite.
[230:35.74]Yes.
[230:37.30]I know.
[230:37.58]I love Patrick.
[230:40.31]He's my favorite character.
[230:58.56]I feel like a new sponge.
[231:02.23]Yeah, but pre-before season four.
[231:06.43]After season four, it was Mrs. Puffs.
[231:09.71]No, that's not true.
[231:10.48]It was Mrs. Puffs always.
[231:13.10]Mrs. Puffs always.
[231:29.30]Electrical grid?
[231:30.04]What's this?
[231:31.42]You know what I thought of recently?
[231:46.70]You know what was the greatest job on Earth?
[231:49.47]It had to have been the greatest job on Earth.
[231:51.95]It was being the guy that played the rock and roll piano.
[231:57.43]Way back in the day.
[232:00.09]Because you just had to mash like four keys at the same time over and over again.
[232:08.06]Just go... While somebody else went... I would have loved to do that job.
[232:28.28]And you can stand up and you can just be like... You're like, everyone's cheering you on.
[232:36.08]And then you move a little bit to the right.
[232:38.20]You got a big jacket on.
[232:39.32]There's like a bunch of flare all over it and shit.
[232:41.04]You look awesome.
[232:41.70]I would have hammed that up like crazy.
[233:03.37]I feel like a new sponge.
[233:14.90]Did somebody just say... I'm trying to read fast and play.
[233:19.66]Did somebody just say the DMT is kicking in?
[233:21.78]Flash like a spring breeze.
[233:41.44]Oh, don't die!
[233:42.30]Wait, this... Okay, hold on.
[233:44.13]He's shooting missiles.
[233:45.11]It's not fair.
[233:45.63]Did it hit me?
[233:57.90]Oh!
[233:58.22]Whoa!
[233:59.08]Whoa!
[234:02.24]Oh, I didn't know I was going for the underwear.
[234:12.45]Just.
[234:13.13]Get.
[234:13.47]This.
[234:13.69]That.
[234:13.83]Wait!
[234:14.07]Okay.
[234:35.87]Open it.
[234:43.87]Did I get the other teleport box?
[234:49.17]Penis is showing.
[234:49.91]That's okay.
[234:50.27]The camera's not on.
[234:50.95]Whatever.
[234:55.29]I don't know why I keep fucking... I want to go up there.
[235:16.50]Ooh, ooh.
[235:19.75]Oh.
[235:22.23]There's spatula at the end of this?
[235:23.37]There better be.
[235:31.01]I think that's the last of our friend Spongebob.
[235:49.05]Uh, by the way.
[235:50.88]No fucking around or anything.
[236:20.49]This is why I have my mic turned down.
[236:22.33]For those of you that are asking, why is the stream always so low?
[236:26.38]Because I'm... Anyways, before I had that little problem there, I was going to say, the last two streams have been like monster streams.
[236:52.15]There was like 15 fucking thousand people at the other one.
[236:55.31]There was like... At the peak here, there was like 9... 9,400?
[236:57.93]9,500?
[236:58.45]That's crazy.
[236:59.15]This is just a huge amount of people have been hanging out the last few streams.
[237:27.01]Wait for the cycle.
[237:28.87]Not that cycle.
[237:35.79]Can I just damage hit damage?
[237:38.61]No, I can't.
[237:40.58]Is all this for a sock?
[237:47.50]Oh, I'm going to die.
[238:03.37]There we are.
[238:19.47]Yes.
[238:20.17]Ooh.
[238:27.66]Is this called rolling boss?
[238:29.80]Finally.
[238:32.66]Alright.
[238:33.56]Okay.
[238:35.46]Okay.
[238:46.08]Spatula is right there.
[238:47.04]Uh, I mean... Let's go get that first.
[239:02.86]Why am I going to play chess?
[239:09.62]That's not going to happen ever.
[239:16.12]I... I think the only time I've ever really played chess... I don't even know how the characters move.
[239:23.91]I know the pawns can move one or two spaces forward.
[239:27.07]I know that the horse can move in an L. I don't even know how many spaces.
[239:31.21]I just know it's an L.
[239:34.66]I know that the bishop with the thing with the crown on it can move all the way diagonally.
[239:43.69]And then I know that the king and the queen, they can move any direction.
[239:52.75]I always just get the queen out there and just get the queen killed.
[239:55.20]That's how I lose every time.
[239:57.30]I just get so impatient that I just know that the queen's like a super assassin, like really cool character to come out with.
[240:02.84]And like, I just take the queen out all the time.
[240:05.68]Just to go like on like assassin missions and she just dies.
[240:07.98]I'm like, I'm sick of this.
[240:12.73]I don't want to move in an L. Where's the queen?
[240:14.47]With a great big ball.
[240:25.98]Impatient.
[240:26.48]Yeah, I can't play chess.
[240:27.58]No way.
[240:29.53]Here's how to win at chess.
[240:30.79]Call everyone who beats you a cheater.
[240:34.29]How do you cheat at chess?
[240:58.29]You have like extra pieces in your pocket?
[241:04.99]In order for the ball to reach the end, you'll have to move the pieces of machinery along the track.
[241:15.31]This is like mouse trap, huh?
[241:17.86]Move the pieces of machinery along the track.
[241:21.04]Well, this is going to be horrible.
[241:22.16]I can already tell.
[241:22.84]Let's see what happens.
[241:29.53]Oh, no.
[241:30.25]Alright, so then it has to go... Okay.
[241:39.50]And then... Come on.
[241:41.96]Hurry up!
[241:44.34]How do I make this move?
[242:03.09]He's smarter than a fifth grader?
[242:04.35]Oh, wait a minute.
[242:10.43]Wait a minute.
[242:11.09]Just wait a minute.
[242:12.13]I didn't even get a look at it all.
[242:13.54]I don't even know where these things all happen.
[242:18.28]How do I get the hammer to move down?
[242:29.33]Wait.
[242:29.59]Hey, hey.
[242:30.33]How did that happen?
[242:31.13]Did I just throw a ball at it?
[242:34.13]Oh, what the hell?
[242:35.11]Okay.
[242:38.27]And what does that do?
[242:41.00]Oh, this thing's set up.
[242:43.66]Alright, I get it.
[242:53.96]Alright, let's go.
[242:55.97]Did you- have you missed?
[243:00.27]How are you missing?
[243:28.27]He's blaming Spongebob.
[243:36.13]Ready.
[243:37.09]Here it comes.
[243:37.47]Okay, then it's gonna get scooped up.
[243:39.97]And then it's gonna get placed up there.
[243:41.25]And then it wraps around.
[243:44.02]Okay, scoop successful.
[243:51.26]Now it's gonna go... ...around.
[243:56.99]and then end up down here it's gonna get scooped up there then it's going up up here
[244:22.35]Okay.
[244:23.41]Then it goes that way.
[244:25.79]That's going fast.
[244:26.37]Okay.
[244:26.83]Ah!
[245:08.39]It's exhausting pretending.
[245:15.08]Scoop it already.
[245:16.04]Come on, man.
[245:16.82]Oh, I'm going to have to do this again.
[245:18.86]Alright, come on.
[245:27.90]There's timing.
[245:28.74]Where did he go?
[245:30.78]Shit, I think I fucked it up again.

[258:54.15]It's a simple puzzle.
[258:56.99]It's just a simple thing.
[258:58.27]You just have to time it right.
[259:14.59]I feel like that's a lot of you guys right now.
[259:16.85]Just like, mm-hmm, I'm just gonna sit down.
[259:18.52]Yep.

[260:30.15]Well done, SpongeBob.
[260:32.15]Now, how's about giving old Mr. Krabs that shiny gold?
[260:37.20]I'll give you a promotion.

[260:45.06]Woo!
[260:45.88]20 seconds!
[260:46.75]Oh, a whole extra 10 seconds added to your break time.
[260:50.81]No, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
[260:52.71]As enticing as that sounds, I can't give this to you.
[260:55.85]I need every golden spatula I can get.
[260:58.49]I was worse, probably.
[260:59.65]I understand, boy.
[261:01.21]I'll just dock 30 seconds from your break time instead.
[261:05.01]Wow, that means I have a negative 20 second break.
[261:08.74]Thanks, Mr. Krabs.
[261:14.60]I was just for one spatula, by the way.
[261:19.30]Oh, so defeated.
[261:28.47]Mine is 20.
[261:28.88]What's going on here?
[261:29.68]Why are you guys fucking with the algorithm?
[261:31.66]Why are you guys fucking with the algorithm?
[261:59.46]Why you guys, uh... Welcome.
[262:00.88]You made it, VOD Watcher.
[262:04.20]Your secret prize... is to go back... to exactly... 61 minutes.
[262:17.39]And if you can tell me the name of the first letter that comes up at the first moment that you hear the sound of me talking...
[262:28.67]I don't care.
[262:30.09]Just watch the rest of the stream.
[262:32.57]Just watch the rest of the stream.
[262:33.99]I don't care anymore.
[262:36.69]It was fun until like 10 words into that sentence.
[262:41.30]Hope you had fun.
[262:50.12]Where's my prize?
[262:52.55]Where's my prize?
[262:58.93]Oh no, he hates us.
[263:02.75]Stop doing minus 20, you're fucking with the algorithm.
[263:10.48]What am I missing?
[263:13.22]What are you guys doing?
[263:14.12]Stop doing that.
[263:15.44]You're gonna break my computer.
[263:28.34]Wait, talk to the computer again?
[263:33.88]It was a joke in the game.
[263:35.58]Oh, well, a joke in the game is affecting me in real life.
[263:50.41]SpongeBob, press all of the security override buttons throughout the Mermalair.
[263:54.97]Then return here and...
[263:57.09]So, what the heck?
[263:57.77]What am I missing?
[263:58.41]Over that way?
[264:10.71]I missed a button, but... Where?
[264:13.25]Probably up.
[264:20.74]Alright, if you see a button, let me know.
[264:23.34]Please tell me.
[264:27.50]Alright, I did all that.
[264:31.50]And then... Over there.
[264:42.95]It's right there.
[264:44.95]Press that one.
[264:49.13]Whoa, there's an oyster.
[264:50.35]I didn't have enough money to open this one.
[264:57.62]Fuck.
[264:59.10]How many do I have?
[265:00.50]Oh, what did I spend all the money on?
[265:01.72]It was on another clam.
[265:13.34]Alright, let's just farm.
[265:19.54]We're gonna farm.
[265:31.50]Just for a minute.
[265:32.24]Just for a minute.
[265:45.93]Just for a minute.
[265:58.17]Hey, VOD watchers, go watch Vine compilations instead.
[266:03.08]Why would you say that?
[266:05.00]You're putting my stream under vine compilations?
[266:09.15]Come on.
[266:12.85]What the heck are you?
[266:14.21]Come on.
[266:31.58]Wow.
[266:34.11]Can I get up that?
[266:36.01]I feel like I can get up there.
[266:37.63]How do I make that jump?
[266:42.29]Just said it.
[266:51.00]The VOD watcher probably wouldn't see it unless you...
[267:04.57]Uh-oh, they started counting.
[267:08.75]This is an extreme scenario.
[267:11.48]This is an extreme scenario.
[267:12.74]Uh-oh.
[267:17.66]I might have to pull out... I have to pull out fucking big guns here.
[267:21.98]I might have to pull out the big guns.
[267:25.25]Wait, wait, how do I get this?
[267:33.05]How do I make this jump?
[267:35.47]Like over there.
[267:36.23]Damn.
[267:39.91]Maybe not.
[267:41.09]Do I have to be like Patrick or something?
[267:43.17]Somebody fatter or bigger?
[267:44.17]Jump on like the light post or something?
[267:55.70]Or is that all the way up?
[267:56.94]Hold on.
[267:59.56]I'm down that way though.
[268:08.83]Happy New Year, guys.
[268:09.81]Yeah.
[268:13.15]I mean, that was a long time ago, but yeah, sure.
[268:17.77]Can Patrick do anything here that's not that?
[268:20.82]Ooh!
[268:22.34]Oh!
[268:26.06]Shit.
[268:26.40]Okay, I want to get over there.
[268:37.78]Do I really need 2,300 clams?
[268:44.24]I think I really actually need 2,300 clams.
[268:57.05]Can I like just... Somebody said skill shop the bowling ball.
[269:02.40]Can I do that from all the way up here?

[270:06.18]Oh, you want to fight?
[270:08.34]You want to fucking fight me?
[270:24.47]Oh, you wanna fight?
[270:25.27]You wanna fuckin' fight?
[270:25.99]Don't fuckin' at me!
[270:27.29]Don't!
[270:28.61]Oh, fuck!
[270:35.61]Oh, you wanna fight?
[270:36.39]You wanna fuckin' fight?
[270:37.13]Don't fuckin' at me!
[270:38.43]Don't!
[270:44.39]Oh, fuck!
[270:49.47]This is so stupid!
[270:54.98]Look at this fucking face.
[271:04.69]This is the creepiest face I've ever seen.
[271:07.11]You know what I love the most about what's going on right now?
[271:24.42]Who wants to take a guess that it took the whole time since I asked that to right now to have that rendered?
[271:39.60]Which was what, two and a half hours ago?
[271:44.07]An hour at least?
[271:48.95]For this.
[271:51.01]Oh, you want to fight?
[271:51.81]You want to fucking fight?
[271:52.53]Don't fucking at me!
[271:57.44]Why can pictures be turned into real life?
[272:02.84]Why can you... You know how many times I've seen that image of my face that I love so much and somebody just puts like fucking like Ronald Reagan talking or like me singing and shit.
[272:14.27]It's insane.
[272:18.19]Pictures can come to life now.
[272:26.11]Deep fakes are one thing, man, but when pictures can start to come alive, that's where you've got to really kind of figure out what you want to do with that technology.
[272:37.92]You don't want to just have that.
[272:43.08]I know our technology.
[272:44.34]This technology is bad.
[272:46.03]He hates it.
[272:47.23]He hates technology.
[272:48.37]He hates us.
[273:01.18]Oh, this... Hold on.
[273:12.95]I have to reload the area.
[273:14.69]Hold on.
[273:14.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[273:18.04]Oh, that's a look-a-me moment right there.
[273:19.54]Holy shit, I did it!
[273:21.16]I actually... Oh, what the fuck?
[273:32.87]I made it.
[273:33.99]I did it, guys.
[273:34.83]I made it.
[273:39.45]I jumped it.
[273:41.68]Cool.
[273:58.45]I'll take the box.
[273:59.99]Thank you.
[274:00.77]Now I can just get her.
[274:06.47]I need to be Patrick, though.
[274:11.25]SpongeBob, how do I get out of here?
[274:13.47]There's no evidence it happened.
[274:14.84]No, there is.
[274:18.00]Well, that depends.
[274:19.36]Do you want the booby-trapped or the non-booby-trapped exit?
[274:22.24]Non-booby-trapped, please.
[274:24.75]Then go that way.
[274:35.14]Sorry, I was just doing my best Jerma985 impression from 40 minutes ago with that ball bullshit.
[274:42.07]Or maybe it was that way.
[274:43.05]It doesn't do anything?
[274:49.49]Alright, well, I got to skip.
[274:55.74]Where does this go?
[274:59.56]Alright, hold on.
[275:00.68]Let me cheat for a second here.
[275:06.93]Okay.
[275:07.56]Nice.
[275:09.32]Now, I go turn into Patrick.
[275:13.24]And... I go back in there.
[275:17.36]Wait, I can't be Patrick.
[275:18.58]I can't get up here with the belt.
[275:28.01]Is there a bus stop here?
[275:35.46]Jump across it as Patrick.
[275:36.72]I can't.
[275:37.06]Oh, it don't matter.
[275:48.75]What is the thumbnail of my stream?
[275:50.11]That face.
[275:53.57]Yeah.
[276:03.26]I could have guessed.
[276:08.37]Wait, I went all the way back.
[276:10.84]I'm just... Whatever.
[276:11.80]I'm going to get enough of the coins.
[276:29.60]You have to click that and watch the video.
[276:31.70]Did somebody else do it?
[276:32.86]And everyone's renders are all ending at the same time?
[276:35.54]Is that what's happening?
[276:38.36]We get to see who had better computers?
[276:46.15]Oh, you want to fight?
[276:46.93]You want to fight?
[277:00.45]Oh Oh
[277:27.63]Can I like, I always freak out a little bit whenever that video shows up in like a joke or if I ever show it.
[277:32.81]Can I even show that on Twitch?
[277:40.58]Oh, this is bad.
[277:44.19]I've lost audio on Spongebob.
[277:59.06]Hey, you want to see what an old YouTube video stream was like?
[278:05.23]Forget about the webcam, but you'll always, you can never get this part out of your head.
[278:24.53]It was like as if the controller was the microphone.
[278:27.96]Like they were using a microphone built into the controller.
[278:30.74]I don't know how you make those sounds.
[278:32.66]Alright.
[278:34.86]Oh.
[278:34.98]I had to click inside of the window.
[278:37.65]Alright, I was gonna say, what the hell is going on?
[278:45.65]I need more clams.
[278:59.95]2300, right?
[279:02.11]I feel like a new sponge.
[279:05.86]Super combo.
[279:11.14]Ultra combo.
[279:15.60]It shines.
[279:18.47]Super combo.
[279:24.49]Ready.
[279:26.47]Ready.
[279:27.57]I get it.
[279:36.26]Ultra!
[279:37.46]Ultra!
[279:38.64]Ultra!
[279:39.72]I used to be able to do... I used to be able to get close to an ultra combo in Killer Instinct.
[279:52.21]With... Oh, what was the... What was like the water guy?
[279:56.56]It was like the water's like goo... What was his name?
[280:04.89]Yeah, Glacius.
[280:05.57]Yeah, there it is.
[280:08.73]I used to get so pissed off.
[280:11.50]What's the skeleton's name with the sword and the shield?
[280:14.22]Easiest character in the whole game to play.
[280:16.78]He had one or two moves that were great.
[280:20.61]And it was just his basic attacks.
[280:22.17]It would piss me off because I would be like, Hyper Combo!
[280:26.07]Super Combo!
[280:27.45]Ultra!
[280:29.19]And then all of a sudden I would get hit by two fucking sword swings by that skeleton.
[280:34.79]All the combo damage I did to the person.
[280:36.55]It was horrible.
[280:39.73]What was his name?
[280:40.51]Not Sans.
[280:41.23]Come on.
[280:46.13]Use the bungee.
[280:46.99]Got it.
[280:48.63]Spinal.
[280:49.17]Yes.
[280:49.49]Thank you.
[280:49.97]There it is.
[281:08.41]Can't reach it.
[281:12.11]Hyper combo.
[281:25.48]Laugh like Spinal.
[281:26.70]I'm not sure I could.
[281:27.50]I don't remember what he sounded like.
[281:32.50]You want me to try and then see if it worked?
[281:34.76]See if it matched up?
[281:41.16]Let me see.
[281:43.14]Spinal.
[281:45.10]Spinal's laugh.
[281:46.26]Spinal's laugh was like... Alright, I don't know why I'm leaning more towards this, but this is where I'm leaning.
[281:58.67]Like a... Something like that was close.
[282:19.32]How many points do I have?
[282:20.16]Alright, I need literally a hundred.
[282:21.60]I need literally a hundred.
[282:24.72]Plant.
[282:26.62]Grunty?
[282:26.98]No, Grunty's like... It's not a half beat.
[282:41.80]Yeah.
[282:43.68]I feel like a new sponge.
[282:49.17]Ernie laughed.
[282:50.83]Who does Bernie laugh?
[282:53.51]I don't know.
[283:05.28]I love Adam Sandler.
[283:07.42]He's my favorite.
[283:09.60]This is my favorite movie of his.
[283:12.22]And then, like, Adam Sandler, like, gets in the fight with, like, Bob Barker, and he's just like... No, he doesn't laugh like that.
[283:19.94]I don't know how he laughs.
[283:23.14]He's not Barney.
[283:27.02]It's not like Fred and Barney.
[283:32.37]Holy shit, there's the last one!
[283:47.07]What does this want me to do?
[283:48.13]What do I... What do I do with this?
[283:54.03]Oh, it's supposed to be invisible.
[283:58.49]Oh, it's an Easter egg.
[284:04.00]Alright.
[284:04.20]Now let's go open the clam so I can get out of here.
[284:07.00]Anybody remember where that is?
[284:13.79]Where'd I go for that one?
[284:17.52]Wait a minute.
[284:23.08]That did something?
[284:33.35]Oh, it's this way.
[284:34.93]Stupid.
[284:44.83]about a clam.
[284:45.51]Oh, come on.
[284:47.63]Come on, what?
[284:49.45]What?
[284:49.65]Come on.
[284:49.93]Oh, I wanted to go through the other skip thing.
[284:53.69]Where's the, um...
[285:12.73]Ah, here we are.
[285:13.54]Alright.
[285:14.56]Nice.
[285:14.82]I have enough money.
[285:20.02]Get in the box.
[285:22.14]Actually do it the right way because I can't just break it.
[285:24.16]Let's pay.
[285:30.89]Do it the way we're supposed to do it.
[285:32.91]Buy the damn thing.
[285:35.27]Be done with it.
[285:56.74]Alright Does that do anything for me?
[286:20.70]Oh, I need a watermelon
[286:25.14]I need one of these.
[286:25.86]Now I'm up top with Patrick.
[286:41.25]I can see Squidward's house from up here.
[286:44.11]And he's not wearing any pants.
[286:46.73]Oh, wait.
[286:47.13]He never wears pants.
[286:48.30]Now, listen up.
[286:49.38]There are eight cylinders over there.
[286:50.98]Eight.
[286:51.78]If you throw something at the cylinders, it'll turn around to the power side.
[286:55.54]Throw a cylinder.
[286:56.36]Power side.
[286:56.96]Turn all eight cylinders around to the power side, and I'll give you a reward.
[287:00.08]Turn them all on.
[287:00.66]Sorry.
[287:01.32]What was that?
[287:02.38]I was watching Squidward.
[287:03.74]Just start turning those cylinders.
[287:07.78]Got it.
[287:21.42]Annoying puzzle that's going to take me, like, 40 minutes to do, or fun slide.
[287:40.55]Oh, it's one of these.
[287:41.47]It's one of these things.
[287:42.97]Where you have to turn them all.
[287:45.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[287:46.55]Yep, yep, yep.
[287:47.70]Reset it.
[287:52.73]Alright, it does it three at a time.
[288:36.33]Are we gonna take the slide well done now there's enough power Why my foot bath, of course here have a golden spatula I
[289:07.73]28 of these.
[289:08.67]29?
[289:10.68]He's got 30 spatulas.
[289:14.46]Now I can take the fun slide.
[289:16.06]And I did the final override.
[289:20.08]Cool.
[289:30.14]Alright.
[289:31.06]So... Now... Can I go in that box?
[289:37.88]Can I get over there?
[289:38.66]What am I gonna do with Badger?
[289:54.25]Alright, computer.
[289:56.03]Is it end of the stream, boys?
[289:58.73]Probably soon, yes.
[290:01.65]Not at this exact moment.
[290:04.44]Not right now, but probably soon.
[290:15.58]I thought I pressed them all.
[290:17.60]Oh, okay.
[290:18.04]After you hurt yourself screaming.
[290:19.06]I didn't scream that loud.
[290:20.08]I like pushed it into the chair and I went like... I'm fine.
[290:43.80]Alright, I did it.
[290:44.28]What the hell does that mean?
[290:52.82]Uh, it was the after that is what the problem was.
[290:55.51]Um, was all the how that played out afterwards.
[291:03.11]Villain containment system.
[291:04.33]This is probably a boss.
[291:14.46]Well, the security system has been shut down, and we got a good checkup.
[291:18.28]Hooray for Justice in all its multi-splendor glory!
[291:22.63]Yeah.
[291:23.83]Well, Justice Boy, you also cut the power to the Mermalair's VCS.
[291:28.55]That's Villain Containment System.
[291:30.73]Is that bad?
[291:31.80]Does Mermaid Man smell like sour milk?
[291:34.38]Yes.
[291:35.26]Yes, I do!
[291:37.25]Oh, no.
[291:38.07]It looks like one of the villains is broken free.
[291:39.97]Yes!
[291:40.27]What's that?
[291:40.85]An evil doer on the loose?
[291:44.79]Who is it?
[291:45.89]Man Ray?
[291:47.36]The atomic flounder?
[291:48.58]The dirty bubble?
[291:51.34]No, worse than that.
[291:53.14]He's your archenemy.
[291:54.74]Prawn.
[291:55.74]Prawn!
[291:59.23]Did someone call?
[292:00.07]Oh, I thought maybe I was looking at superheroes.
[292:04.06]But now I see it's just a couple of pieces of now driftwood.
[292:08.60]Prawn!
[292:09.22]I'll never forgive you, you madman!
[292:14.79]What did Prawn do?
[292:16.31]The worst thing you can imagine.
[292:17.75]He put all of Mermaid Man's white clothes in the washer with a red sock.
[292:22.93]Everything I
[292:25.52]I do that shit all the time.
[292:26.82]I don't get it.
[292:28.44]I just throw... Kim used to go crazy.
[292:30.78]She used to hate when I did this.
[292:33.00]I would just put all my clothes in the washing machine.
[292:36.57]That would just... That didn't matter.
[292:37.87]If they were... I didn't care.
[292:40.83]Jeans, like red shirts.
[292:42.85]I just did it.
[292:44.59]She'd be like, don't do that.
[292:45.85]I'm like, what's happening?
[292:46.77]Just fucking wash them.
[292:51.87]Now, I separate all my brights.
[292:55.43]All the, you know, you do your whites.
[292:58.87]I shall avenge you, Mermaid Man!
[293:23.74]Oh, he's... I thought he was huge.
[293:25.42]I thought he was really big.
[293:28.44]Okay, I tried the five-year-old way to play the game.
[293:38.05]Now let's try the actual smart person, old adult person way to play this game.
[293:42.20]Because the six-year-old me would have done that and would have turned it off.
[294:17.70]His shield went down.
[294:19.00]I thought I could go in there and hit him.
[294:38.51]Oh, man.
[294:44.84]That's a shit spawn, to be honest.
[294:46.10]Alright, we're good.
[295:15.15]He's gonna spawn a shitload, right?
[295:17.00]No.
[295:45.11]This game's pretty- This is a fun game.
[295:48.17]You know what?
[295:52.38]I think I might beat this game.
[295:56.02]Holy shit, don't blow it.
[296:07.41]No, no, not again.
[296:09.33]This is not fair.
[296:11.17]I've got a frozen wedgie for this.
[296:13.74]Is this the end of Prawn?
[296:15.46]Prawn is safely locked away again, thanks to you, Frankie.
[296:21.24]My name's SpongeBob.
[296:22.91]Here, I found this in my sidekick.
[296:27.36]You gotta give me more than one.
[296:28.74]You can't just give me one.
[296:29.65]Thank you.
[296:30.23]Here you go, Frank Ugly.
[296:30.91]Thirty!
[296:31.09]Very cool.
[297:10.70]So, is this area done?
[297:13.54]Is Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's quest line complete?
[297:23.25]That was cool.
[297:23.99]I like that area.
[297:24.63]That was fun.
[297:33.06]Security tunnel?
[297:33.88]I think I can just leave, right?
[297:39.71]Alright, let's go to... Go back to the hub.
[297:49.13]This is a good spot to stop.
[297:52.49]Is there... Is there, like, more than four or five hours worth of stuff to do?
[297:58.56]As of right now?
[298:07.53]No, I like it.
[298:08.45]It's fun just to hang out and just do the shit and just play it.
[298:15.51]You're at the halfway point?
[298:16.59]Yeah, alright.
[298:17.51]I'll complete it next time.
[298:22.56]There's also multiplayer.
[298:27.48]How do you have multiplayer in this game?
[298:29.49]Hold on, I'm not done.
[298:30.13]I want to go look.
[298:32.11]There's things I want to look at.
[298:35.98]I know face cam.
[298:36.96]I don't really do face cam.
[298:38.94]Only sometimes.
[298:40.72]When I'm feeling really cocky and confident.
[298:44.18]That's when you'll see it turned on.
[298:45.38]Fields.
[298:55.89]This is... Blue Lagoon.
[299:01.42]Right.
[299:01.70]Somebody wanted me to... Alright.
[299:02.66]We'll do that next.
[299:11.84]I have 30 now.
[299:12.76]Wasn't there something else?
[299:13.50]Yeah, over here.
[299:22.34]When naming a character, Dave Colgate leads to you leading dog ass hair.
[299:31.20]That's weird.
[299:34.94]Yeah.
[299:37.46]Sand Mountain.
[299:38.22]Alright.
[299:40.72]Okay, this is the one I want to do.
[299:49.84]Okay.
[299:50.48]Alright, so here's the plan.
[299:51.40]I'm going to give you guys the kind of next streaming phase.
[299:59.34]As you know, I'm still trying to ease back into streaming.
[300:03.08]Sitting here for more than four or five hours can fuck me up.
[300:09.26]uncomfortable but uh there's some other things I'm gonna do too to help with that I just got this desk like not even a year and a half ago and it's unfortunate that I have to say this but sitting down sucks so I'm probably going to just invest in a really really just good standing desk so that's something I'm gonna do too eventually
[300:41.13]I can I'll find something else somewhere else to put this one I like this desk a lot and one that goes up and down yeah that's the idea is like maybe I could have one that is I can sit down at it for a few hours and then alright let's get the I gotta get the up and stand up for like another couple hours
[301:08.18]Here comes the stand-up comedy!
[301:10.24]Yeah, so if you don't know, I'll go over this again just because I've only talked about it once, so might as well talk about it again.
[301:17.61]I'm going back to the pre-Vegas streams, which is I'm only going to be live like three days a week.
[301:25.73]And those streams are going to be somewhere like this around like five hours, five-ish, four to six-ish hours.
[301:34.32]The end of the stream wind down is going away.
[301:37.54]We're not going to do any bit readings at the end of the streams anymore.
[301:40.96]And it was a hard thing to do.
[301:43.33]It was a hard thing to remove.
[301:45.65]But it means that I can sit here for as long as I can and as long as I really want to.
[301:53.63]Comfortably.
[301:55.88]Without needing to potentially add another hour or so to the stream.
[302:00.70]To go over the bits and talk and hang out and stuff.
[302:06.10]But that's sort of the thought process there, and it's probably going to be pretty permanent.
[302:09.92]Because I've been gone for two months trying to get this figured out, and this could just be a longer-term scenario where I have to just manage whatever's going on.
[302:21.79]I'm optimistic still, though, that there's something just random and stupid that it's going to be.
[302:25.98]Oh, wow, that's real fucking dumb, huh?
[302:28.00]It was that the whole time?
[302:30.28]Here's how you fix it.
[302:32.26]I'm still pretty optimistic about it, so we'll see.
[302:38.53]But with that being said, I'm going back to the kind of pre-Vegas... I almost said pre-Vegas arc.
[302:45.63]A lot of you guys say that.
[302:50.34]Going back to pre-Vegas stream times and lengths.
[302:56.42]So I'll see you guys on... I will be back.
[303:00.56]I'll see you guys on probably the middle of next week.
[303:05.44]Either on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[303:07.93]And at that point, I'm going to try to do two days in a row.
[303:09.77]I'm going to try to do Wednesday and Thursday in a row.
[303:15.82]See how that plays out.
[303:17.98]Try to do maybe Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday?
[303:21.10]Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday?
[303:22.62]So we'll see.
[303:30.05]Then I'll update the sus tomorrow or the next day.
[303:32.11]I'll figure out which one it's going to be.
[303:39.07]When's movie night?
[303:40.83]Yeah, we'll talk for a little bit.
[303:43.09]Streams are not just going to turn off.
[303:45.05]Obviously, I still have the credits to do.
[303:46.49]I'm not going to be reading bits or anything.
[303:51.14]But we are going to hang out for about 10 minutes or so.
[303:53.94]So don't worry.
[303:56.86]Let's do that now.
[303:58.68]Oh, where's the music?
[304:01.76]Ah, I got it.
[304:02.36]There it is.
[304:04.08]Movie night is going to end up being...
[304:08.74]I gotta come up.
[304:09.32]There's a lot of streams that are on the way here.
[304:12.54]That I really have to set hard dates for.
[304:14.06]The DLC Movie Night is... On Wednesday, I'll give you a hard date.
[304:21.09]It's gonna be within the next 10 days.
[304:23.27]That's pretty much a guarantee.
[304:25.01]Within the next, like, 10 to 15 days.
[304:28.07]And then there's the webcam stream.
[304:30.09]There's FTK.
[304:33.11]August is gonna be... There's a lot of stuff going on.
[304:35.39]Should be fun.
[304:37.95]We're probably going to have to break it down into more than potentially two or even three nights.
[304:43.01]Because you guys have had months and months and months to work on projects.
[304:49.35]We're probably going to have to put some criteria in.
[304:52.15]Maybe some changes on like the second or third night maybe.
[304:56.42]I don't know.
[304:57.08]I'll have to figure it out.
[304:57.84]I want to try to get as many things seen as possible.
[305:05.34]But yeah, let's run the credits.
[305:07.30]These are all the subs today.
[305:08.94]There was a lot of, uh, major sub drops.
[305:13.74]Which, thank you.
[305:14.48]I... When I went... When I left back in the end of May... No, not the end of May.
[305:22.09]Yeah.
[305:22.41]Wait, was it May?
[305:23.85]When did I leave?
[305:26.59]Yeah, holy shit.
[305:27.51]It was May, wasn't it?
[305:32.43]It's been almost two and a half months.
[305:36.11]Well, I'll just tell you just for full transparency here.
[305:42.43]You guys, in the last two, three days, have brought the sub count of the stream back to where it was before I left.
[305:50.49]That's fucking crazy.
[305:56.38]In three days.
[305:59.24]It's like all of you came back and decided to resub.
[306:03.24]Like, I can't even fucking comprehend that.
[306:08.86]And people that were still subbed to the channel for the months that there was nothing here, that's even harder to believe.
[306:16.38]So, thanks.
[306:23.02]That's incredible to think about that.
[306:26.34]I'm going to try to use the money as best I can.
[306:34.00]Because obviously that's a concern, right?
[306:35.94]Anytime you go away for a little while, you're like, oh, are people going to remember who I am?
[306:40.78]Am I going to come back and people are going to... How many people are going to be there?
[306:45.71]Will I lose a shitload of people?
[306:48.45]If I go away for three, four months or something, I'm going to... My channel's going to die.
[306:54.31]But it didn't even fucking happen.
[306:57.39]There are more people watching now than before.
[307:00.01]I can't even believe it.
[307:07.38]Who is this guy?
[307:08.62]Who is this guy?
[307:09.40]Who are you?
[307:10.22]Who?
[307:10.58]Who?
[307:11.10]Who are you, Omegalo?
[307:12.68]Wait, what?
[307:16.17]Who are you?
[307:17.67]What?
[307:23.17]Who, Omegalo?
[307:24.29]Wait, am I getting hooded in my own stream?
[307:36.55]That's so funny.
[307:42.06]Now, long story short, I'm forever grateful that you guys, all of you pretty much came back and then some.
[307:49.78]Because it was a concern to have.
[307:55.41]And you smashed it.
[307:56.97]Thanks, guys.
[308:01.31]We'll see you again.
[308:01.81]We'll see you on probably Tuesday or Wednesday.
[308:05.25]Let me run the credits.
[308:07.12]We're going to do SpongeBob again.
[308:09.06]I'm going to beat it.
[308:10.64]And then on Thursday... I have the Riddick games I really want to play, but I also... I wonder if I want to just do the webcam stream.
[308:19.79]See if I can get that... See if I can get it to work.
[308:34.10]Where are my credits?
[308:34.96]I'm gonna get better at this whole streamer thing.
[308:41.40]Do the webcam one?
[308:42.24]Yeah, I did look into... After the stream from two days ago, I did look into it more.
[308:47.82]I think it's a little more elaborate than I think.
[308:50.56]I'm gonna have to add some peripherals.
[308:59.57]But here comes the credits.
[309:00.23]These are all the people that subbed today.
[309:02.65]It's doing the Star Wars thing again.
[309:16.76]So this is very obviously broken.
[309:19.50]This one is not going to work well, huh?
[309:29.12]Okay, so let me get the other one, because the other one actually works.
[309:33.20]Is it the same 10 people from last time?
[309:40.88]I think it's the same people.
[309:44.76]Yeah, it has to be.
[309:50.35]Only those people sub.
[309:52.11]Yeah.
[309:52.25]Alright, let me pull up the other one.
[310:00.56]Credits.
[310:01.70]Okay.
[310:06.50]Alright, here we go.
[310:07.06]Do I have to do it over here?
[310:26.74]Okay.
[310:28.20]Um... What?
[310:38.85]You know what I really, really desperately need?
[310:40.41]I have to set up... I have to set up, like, a new button to press to get, like, a window.
[310:48.84]It's killing me.
[310:49.40]Because, like, half the time it doesn't capture my window.
[310:55.12]And, like, I sit here trying to do browser source and then capture window and shit.
[310:58.16]It's really annoying.
[311:00.28]I should just be able to do this.
[311:06.19]Why not?
[311:06.87]Wrong.
[311:07.15]Okay.
[311:09.53]I want to add a capture.
[311:15.60]On.
[311:18.12]I think my computer just sucks.
[311:20.16]I think I've come to the realization I think this computer just sucks.
[311:41.09]Oh, hi.
[311:45.67]Not what I wanted.
[311:46.39]No, get that off.
[311:54.15]Hey, get out of here!
[311:56.96]Oh shit, they can see everything!
[312:00.34]Oh, they can see everything!
[312:05.96]Look at this shit.
[312:09.83]Windows, look at... Frasersauce3... Oh no!
[312:14.11]Oh no, you can see all my fucking... Look at this!
[312:18.04]You can see all my shitty command center!
[312:22.48]Image 1, Image 3, Jerm Sandwich... JVG... Jerma and Jex... Top Bits, Top Bits 2!
[312:43.06]I don't even know what these are!
[312:54.72]What is Juma's sandwich?
[312:58.90]You wanna know the honest-to-God stupid truth about this whole thing?
[313:03.31]That was probably the image, name, and file of a fucking picture that somebody gave me to show on stream seven months ago.
[313:15.34]And it's just still down here.
[313:17.58]That's so embarrassing.
[313:20.26]This is so embarrassing.
[313:26.82]No, it doesn't exist anymore.
[313:28.22]It has to exist in the folder.
[313:29.98]It won't show up on stream.
[313:33.71]It's the McChicken picture.
[313:35.43]Yeah.
[313:38.27]No, it's not attached to anything.
[313:40.11]It's not in the same spot where it was six, seven months ago.
[313:44.21]It's been moved.
[313:46.74]Okay, anyways.
[313:48.56]Let's go ahead and do this.
[313:51.40]Oh, we can see his command center.
[313:57.07]Oh, you guys got to see behind the curtain and how shitty my actual streamer setup is.
[314:04.09]Image three.
[314:07.85]How many people were here today?
[314:15.78]Here we go.
[314:24.76]Let's do it.
[314:26.00]Here come the credits.
[314:27.00]I gotta get this fixed for next time.
[314:41.92]Here they come.
[314:45.75]And they're in alphabetical order.
[314:52.59]We finally get to see his command center.
[315:05.24]My eyes hurt.
[315:15.20]When is the rumble?
[315:17.84]The rumble really kind of got just thrown.
[315:22.25]Just in a total, total, just dizzy.
[315:26.07]The original plan for the Rumble was it was going to be a charity stream to sponsor my buddy's run in the Boston.
[315:32.94]Somebody, hold on a minute.
[315:33.72]That person's name was Germas775.
[315:37.08]Wait, that was Germas785?
[315:39.62]What was that?
[315:43.22]Germas795.
[315:43.88]Alright, well, if that person starts streaming, you know, you know, we talked about it.
[315:53.16]Anyways, it was supposed to be a charity stream for the Boston Marathon.
[315:57.86]It was going to sponsor my buddy's run in the Boston Marathon.
[316:01.92]There was a whole charity setup.
[316:03.08]There was a whole page that was ready.
[316:05.36]And they canceled the marathon.
[316:08.47]The Boston Marathon has been just canceled.
[316:11.79]So it really was like, oh, now I'm going to do another one.
[316:19.17]Maybe two of them.
[316:19.81]I just don't know.
[316:24.10]Because all this was before, obviously, COVID-19.
[316:26.61]You had this planned for a little while before that.
[316:35.59]But that's kind of what happened to that.
[316:36.73]It was supposed to happen in September.
[316:40.41]And that stream was supposed to happen months ago.
[316:49.22]But... There will be another Rumble.
[316:52.62]I promise.
[316:53.20]I promise.
[316:56.01]It's not like I don't think about it all the time.
[316:58.07]So, there are tons of ideas and tons of things I want to do.
[317:03.75]Yeah, I... Oh, I... Yeah, I pinky promise.
[317:05.85]Absolutely.
[317:09.91]There's other fun stuff to do as well, though.
[317:13.39]Alright, I'll see you guys on probably Wednesday.
[317:14.99]I had a lot of fun.
[317:17.01]Spongebob's... I love this game.
[317:19.24]I think it's really good.
[317:20.12]I'm glad you guys made me play it.
[317:21.84]Because I wasn't going to play it unless you told me to.
[317:30.83]Wait until WWE 2K20.
[317:32.90]I don't think I want to do it in one of those games.
[317:37.56]I think I really would go back painfully somehow to like 2K14.
[317:43.32]Or maybe even stay on the current year that I'm on now.
[317:48.60]Where a lot of the characters already are.
[317:50.40]Because man, I refuse to buy that new 2K20.
[317:56.63]Whatever, the one that just came out this past year.
[317:59.31]No, I refuse to buy it.
[318:05.13]It's shit.
[318:05.67]No, it is shit.
[318:11.02]2K14 is the best.
[318:12.70]Yeah.
[318:13.88]No, I know.
[318:14.86]The problem with 2K14 is just it takes so fucking long to do anything.
[318:19.53]2K14, it just... You'll make a character, you'll load up a character...
[318:26.52]And you'll put a layer on them, you'll put two layers on them, three layers on them, and then... The game starts to go... For you to load a piece of clothing.
[318:38.63]It's the worst.
[318:44.36]I wish and this is so horrible that they didn't do this it was so close but 2k14 just didn't make it to the ps4 they waited to make that new 2k15 right was the first one and if they had I wish they just had made 2k14 the one for ps4 because it was really close right it was like not even a year
[319:20.97]Right Etalyx?
[319:21.53]Yeah, a little right Etalyx.
[319:24.03]What is he doing?
[319:24.96]Let's see what he's up to.
[319:29.74]Let's see what he's doing.
[319:37.14]Okay, for a second I was like, wait, what?
[319:39.54]I was like, how is this Etalyx a stream?
[319:58.22]You're playing PUBG?
[320:02.97]He's playing Total War Warhammer 2.
[320:04.81]You're not subbed?
[320:10.95]No, I'm not logged in.
[320:13.91]I'm not logged in on Chrome.
[320:16.37]Alright, go say hello.
[320:26.24]He's in his new place now.
[320:29.18]LW1, a full room tour.
[320:33.81]And I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[320:36.37]Take care, guys.
[320:36.85]Have a good one.
[320:38.69]See you soon.
