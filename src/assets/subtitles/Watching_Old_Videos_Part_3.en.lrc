[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.00]Good morning.
[00:04.80]Or good afternoon, if you're from the European crowd.
[00:17.05]My name is Jeremy.
[00:18.91]I'll be joining you here for a few hours.
[00:20.73]At least probably three or four hours or so before my doctor's appointment today.
[00:23.67]That's why I am live so early.
[00:30.60]I have a doctor's appointment.
[00:32.54]This is the follow-up to my colonoscopy, so I have to go to it.
[00:37.24]I can't just not go.
[00:38.34]So I figured that we would watch some old YouTube videos.
[00:44.66]Remember we were talking about that last week.
[00:51.23]Epic?
[00:52.19]What's epic?
[00:56.55]Old tuber?
[00:57.09]Yeah.
[00:59.12]We're gonna dig into the old VHS file here.
[01:06.09]I'm at work.
[01:08.53]Well, just... You can't... You can't be productive.
[01:17.41]Look, just, okay, I don't know where you work, but let's say you work at retail or something.
[01:26.23]If you work at a retail shop or you work at a department store, this is something you should never do.
[01:31.25]This is part of a funny character joke, but what you should do is just put me through the PA system in the store, so then you don't have to worry about missing something.
[01:51.49]Can you imagine if the customers in like a department store just walking around and they just hear this?
[01:59.60]They would think somebody at the store was doing this.
[02:01.82]Yeah, I'm really trying to get my podcast career going.
[02:08.80]Alright, dude.
[02:12.42]But anyways.
[02:12.90]I'm going to show you.
[02:15.50]I'm going to show you me real soon here.
[02:18.84]You're going to get to see.
[02:19.54]You're going to get to see my face.
[02:21.94]Oh, I've got another thing to tell you too.
[02:23.52]But I'm going to wait until there's enough people in here before I talk about that one.
[02:30.20]I've got a. This is an update stream.
[02:34.44]Yeah, I am going to do a face reveal.
[02:38.47]It's been long enough.
[02:45.92]I better be in a Spider-Man costume, right?
[02:47.92]No.
[02:55.30]Your hair?
[02:56.93]What about my hair?
[03:01.79]What about it?
[03:02.27]You know, somebody asked me... What is with you and having, like, the slicked back hair for E3?
[03:16.91]Well, it's nothing to do with E3, that's a joke.
[03:20.39]This is a stream before noon.
[03:25.70]Because that's like I showered today, hair.
[03:29.38]So anytime you see my hair like this, it means that there was very, very recently, there was a shower.
[03:36.56]This is just water, it's not grease.
[03:45.31]Your hair's really greasy today.
[03:49.87]This shows my real hairline, though.
[03:52.09]Now, nobody can tell me that I don't... Look at... Look at the... Oh, no, we're not gonna do that.
[03:57.16]We're not gonna do that.
[03:58.72]We're not gonna do that.
[03:59.92]That was just like... There was like a McDonald's M right here.
[04:06.08]I'm 34 years old, alright?
[04:07.83]I look pretty good for 34.
[04:12.58]Anyways.
[04:13.52]Let's get that off.
[04:14.54]I don't know.
[04:14.84]Get me out of here.
[04:19.90]No, you don't.
[04:20.62]I look good for 34.
[04:26.85]That's what I tell... Every time I look in the mirror.
[04:28.37]Can anybody else do this?
[04:32.51]I stand in the mirror naked.
[04:35.35]And just, like, move my shoulders around.
[04:37.63]You go like this.
[04:38.03]You just go...
[04:44.34]I look pretty good!
[04:45.82]And then you fucking move on.
[04:51.58]What a fucking freak.
[04:53.04]That's- am I a freak?
[04:55.84]I just like move my body around.
[05:01.31]I don't flex in the mirror, I just like fucking move my arms and shoulders around for like five minutes and then I say 34 by the way.
[05:07.37]34 by- I say it like ten times.
[05:14.98]I hear Kim walking back and forth, just, like, sighing.
[05:18.94]I don't know what that means.
[05:20.46]What does that mean?
[05:26.61]Anyways, let's do some videos.
[05:28.25]We're only going to be here for about four hours or so.
[05:31.09]Because I have to... Gotta go.
[05:35.71]So, I gotta leave by... What time is it?
[05:37.87]11?
[05:37.89]1, 2, 3, 4... Okay, I got, like, four and a half hours.
[05:40.82]Four hours.
[05:45.24]So, the first one we're gonna watch is Streamer's Choice.
[05:48.48]We're gonna watch old videos.
[05:51.22]And Streamer's Choice... is... a video that I have to figure out right now, because I didn't pick one.
[06:00.57]Let me think here.
[06:01.51]What old video do I want to watch?
[06:09.73]I don't have any.
[06:10.97]There's so many.
[06:15.34]Shit, I just went into like the chocolate store, and went up to the front, and the person behind the counter, like the candy, coffee, not the candy, the candy, the chocolate candy, the chocolate candy counter.
[06:29.23]I got it, I figured it out.
[06:31.05]The lady at the chocolate candy counter is like, can I help you?
[06:35.68]No.
[06:37.44]Then you'd leave.
[06:38.02]Because you're fucking scared to pick chocolates.
[06:46.05]Alright, I got one.
[06:47.03]I got one.
[06:47.47]I got one.
[06:47.87]Hold on.
[06:51.86]Yeah, we'll watch the Wonder Book.
[06:54.78]We didn't watch that one last time, did we?
[06:57.70]If you type in Wonder Book... Which one?
[07:00.08]Book of Dinosaur?
[07:00.84]Book of Spells?
[07:04.36]I haven't seen these in a long time.
[07:05.54]Alright, we'll do Book of Spells.
[07:18.70]This thing was so fucking stupid.
[07:25.04]God, I look like a fucking psycho.
[07:28.78]God, that short hair, like, just didn't do much justice for me, I don't think.
[07:35.45]Oh, but I forgot about the update!
[07:36.91]I have an update for- whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.
[07:38.23]Alright, this is a book of spells.
[07:51.87]Okay, don't mind me, every couple of weeks I just relive the fact that I beat Sekiro and I watch some of my old Sekiro playthroughs to see how good I did.
[08:02.88]Ah, this is Book of Spells.
[08:09.49]Hey, there it is.
[08:12.19]You guys want my dumbass on camera?
[08:15.01]That's how this works, right?
[08:29.81]Holy shit, hold on.
[08:31.35]I gotta, like, tape these down.
[08:34.25]Alright, it's getting to the point where I'm getting, like, old man, like, fucking Christopher Lloyd hair back here.
[08:41.16]And I really considered at one point putting, like, masking tape just like this.
[08:45.50]Alright, let's go.
[08:55.33]Intro music?
[08:56.29]Is there... Did I just...
[08:59.09]Okay, let's go.
[09:00.61]You ready?
[09:02.11]This is the Wonder Book.
[09:03.63]Hopefully you can hear it.
[09:04.29]Oh, we're ready.
[09:10.34]Oh, intro music!
[09:13.98]You mean the intro music was on?
[09:15.90]Okay, I fixed it.
[09:18.58]Why is the intro still on?
[09:19.70]I turned it off!
[09:24.22]Alright, here we go.
[09:25.80]Book spells.
[09:35.22]Welcome to the... I've found in my book of spells, it seems.
[09:42.61]Wooden paneling.
[09:45.01]We're going to go with Slytherin.
[09:46.39]Because I have my ceremonial wizard garb on.
[09:50.64]Oof.
[09:53.80]Look at my hand.
[09:54.72]That's good comedy.
[09:56.26]I'm like glitching through this.
[09:58.04]Garrett, did it take you a wizard photo?
[10:00.82]Okay.
[10:02.51]Gave me my wizard photo.
[10:06.49]Come on.
[10:07.21]I was a fucking... I was a path maker.
[10:11.03]Am I a wizard yet, mummy?
[10:13.79]I was the AR guy.
[10:16.95]Wait.
[10:18.18]Oh, it's a frog!
[10:18.84]Whoa, look!
[10:19.12]Oh, shit!
[10:19.38]Where'd he go?
[10:20.10]Come here!
[10:20.56]Come here, frog!
[10:21.00]I got ya!
[10:21.28]Bye!

[10:24.83]Come here!
[10:46.82]Oh, he's gone.
[10:47.76]See ya.
[10:48.18]Alright, I got another frog.
[10:50.78]Good.
[10:52.29]Alright, I gotta do... When Guardian Leviosa!
[10:54.19]Ooh, there's Mr. Frog.
[10:55.39]I need another frog.
[10:56.03]I need another frog, please.
[10:56.71]Respawn the frog, please.
[10:57.41]Thank you very much.
[10:58.09]He looks so young.
[10:58.61]Where am I supposed to put him?
[11:12.29]He's going way too far away.
[11:13.41]Come back.
[11:14.09]Of course, this toad was just conjured up.
[11:16.52]Oh, there he goes.
[11:17.82]You need to be a bit more careful.
[11:20.58]Watch where you spray that thing.
[11:23.72]Oh, where's the book?
[11:25.24]Oh, that looks bad.
[11:26.22]Oh, look out.
[11:28.34]Look out, man.
[11:29.02]I got you.
[11:29.52]It's like a Super Soka commercial.
[11:31.68]That's a Super Soka commercial.
[11:33.22]It is.
[11:33.36]That's a Super Soka commercial.
[11:35.36]I got you.
[11:35.86]Look out to me.
[11:36.54]He sprayed us.
[11:37.26]What do you want?
[11:41.62]Oh my fuck.
[11:42.16]Cool!
[11:42.26]Let's... Let's go!
[11:43.06]I look fucking 17.
[12:07.08]Oh, fascinating.
[12:07.80]That was dumb.
[12:08.54]There appears to be a hole in your book.
[12:10.25]Oh, look.
[12:10.69]Oh, look.
[12:10.97]Can you see that hole there?
[12:12.37]Look at it there.
[12:13.85]Whoa.
[12:14.85]Whoa, it's bright.
[12:16.41]Oh, I can't see.
[12:17.51]I feel like I'm on a Universal Studios ride.
[12:19.85]Oh, where's your book gone?
[12:25.63]There we go.
[12:26.85]Nice tuber reactions.
[12:27.97]Yeah, these are pretty good tuber reactions, I would say.
[12:31.93]Ow!
[12:33.26]Ow!
[12:39.98]I'm back.
[12:40.34]I'm back.
[12:40.86]It was a joke.
[12:42.33]I'd still do that.
[12:43.47]That was a joke.
[12:46.17]I was just fucking around.
[12:47.17]Alright, let's go.
[12:48.07]The master of the test.
[12:50.39]I'm afraid you're not ready to tackle the chapter's final test yet.
[12:53.85]There we are.
[12:57.64]Your first test.
[13:00.02]Alright, what am I doing?
[13:01.44]My grandkids are going to see this.
[13:02.62]They're going to be like, what the fuck is wrong?
[13:07.48]Oh, this is so fucking stressful.
[13:10.12]to cast there try again I think water is the key to solving this bit of the test uh not quite that's what oh alright what am I doing pull up the glowing text on the page to begin
[13:26.45]Oh, this is so fucking stressful!
[13:27.61]Okay, I thought I was speaking a different language.
[13:29.35]That's water, isn't that water?
[13:30.01]What?
[13:30.11]What the fuck is it?
[13:30.57]What is water?
[13:31.37]I can't... Why am I looking down at the book to see what it is?
[13:34.67]The book is not... There's nothing here.
[13:35.95]It's... That's not here.
[13:36.73]Why am I...
[13:53.97]Get some water in there.
[13:54.89]It's not full yet.
[13:55.73]Get some more water into the fountain.
[14:00.29]You should be able to run out of water.
[14:02.09]Oh, I spilled it.
[14:03.98]Oh, come on.
[14:04.50]You tell me that's not going to spill out.
[14:07.06]Are you kidding me right now?
[14:08.02]This is just like jello in here?
[14:09.90]What the fuck is going on?
[14:13.00]The fuck did he say?
[14:14.78]What?
[14:16.80]It's me.
[14:17.26]I said it.
[14:17.76]It's me.
[14:19.92]Keep it up.
[14:21.61]Open your book.
[14:22.51]There's things left to do in this chapter.
[14:32.94]I'm stuck right now.
[14:35.40]See, this wasn't even like part of me making a video.
[14:37.16]Get out!
[14:38.99]Get off of me!
[14:39.87]I just do this shit.
[14:40.91]Fuck, I'm stuck in my robes.
[14:42.43]Remember how I told you about how... We're gonna go back here.
[14:44.65]Remember how I told you how I just do shit?
[14:47.50]Remember, you cut up a video.
[14:49.14]This video, I probably took like two or three hours playing this game.
[14:52.62]And I was just sitting there doing this.
[14:54.28]The only reason why this clip was used is because I got stuck instead of ripping my robe like in half.
[14:58.42]It's the only reason why this is here.
[15:00.61]This, what you're looking at right here, is what I probably did for 20 straight minutes.
[15:05.77]And now here's the part that I wanted to keep.
[15:21.14]What the fuck?
[15:22.86]I'm stuck in my robes!
[15:26.84]You see these, like, birds?
[15:28.36]These butterflies?
[15:29.28]Oh, shit!
[15:29.92]Here comes the Adam Sandler gibberish.
[15:33.48]Here comes the Adam Sandler gibberish.
[15:37.46]Oh.
[15:37.60]Oh.
[15:48.08]Oh, this clock is broken.
[15:50.21]Oh, it's all over me.
[15:51.93]Oh, boy, what do I do?
[15:58.27]Reparo.
[16:00.85]Oh, come on now.
[16:02.15]I did it.
[16:03.75]I wasn't even trying.
[16:06.25]What the fuck is this?
[16:08.21]Nearly there.
[16:09.59]Trial number three looks straightforward.
[16:11.97]My guess is you need to make things a bit more balanced.
[16:17.97]Big!
[16:18.23]Big man!
[16:19.55]Is that to make the scorpion big?
[16:21.29]Why did I use this?
[16:22.79]I don't want a big-ass scorpion!
[16:26.49]Does it sting me in the balls or something?
[16:29.25]Why do I use this?
[16:30.21]Hey!
[16:30.41]Hey!
[16:30.67]Hey!
[16:30.75]Abunicus!
[16:31.11]I guess this is kinda cool.
[16:33.11]Shit.
[16:33.23]Okay, I'm turning the page.
[16:50.57]Oh, this is a classic.
[16:52.15]This is a classic, what happens here.
[17:02.93]I think I busted it.
[17:04.11]Classic.
[17:06.32]I'm pretty sure I broke the book.
[17:08.74]I'm pretty positive the book is all screwed up right now.
[17:11.14]What if I hold it?
[17:15.74]Come on!
[17:16.32]Classic.
[17:17.58]Come on!
[17:18.58]book don't work what the fuck is going on the book is messed up book of spells my ass how long does this go on for it's all glitched out where's like the calibrate button make sure it's closed with the front cover facing upwards if you can't see yourself and your wonder book on screen try moving back a little press the move button when you go off
[17:48.61]This is like last second parent Halloween costume.
[17:52.05]I don't even give a shit.
[17:55.84]That's like, oh, my kids want to go trick-or-treating.
[17:58.24]Oh, may as well just put a hood on.
[18:01.56]Now I'm a wizard or a sorcerer or like a guy.
[18:09.63]That was it.
[18:10.03]That was the book of spells.
[18:13.71]If you're new to this channel or you haven't been here for that long...
[18:18.12]There are like two more of those, and we're going to suffer through them right now.
[18:21.26]Now, that was fun.
[18:22.66]That was a fun video.
[18:23.40]What was wrong with that?
[18:27.78]We're going to suffer through it.
[18:30.67]Alright, let me... First, let me find it.
[18:35.69]Oh, the update.
[18:37.53]The update, the update, the update.
[18:40.15]What's the point of this stream?
[18:41.17]This is one of the most highly requested streams.
[18:45.69]I get it all the time.
[18:49.83]A lot of people want me to watch old videos of mine.
[18:54.19]So the point is to just hang out and watch for a couple hours and... I mean, there's not really... There is no, like, point.
[19:01.66]I mean, the point is just to remember things and watch things and... I don't know, just for fun.
[19:12.39]Oh, the update.
[19:13.31]I'm gonna... Let's just say it.
[19:15.91]the Robot Carnival stream, let's get on camera for this because I want people to make sure they can see my mouth moving and shit.
[19:23.65]The Robot Carnival stream is going to have a hard date in like less than a week.
[19:32.78]That shit is going to be on total fucking lockdown and it's going to happen in September.
[19:38.56]And I will have a real hard actual date.
[19:42.15]And we'll be talking about this all for the next two months straight.
[19:46.52]I'm gonna have to fly out like two or three times to this facility because it's not happening in Vegas.
[19:52.73]This is happening on location somewhere because it's not here.
[19:57.71]So an announcement of an announcement.
[20:00.99]Well, the announcement of the announcement is that it's gonna be late September.
[20:08.21]I can't give you the exact day in September, but just know that it's probably gonna be the last week or so of September.
[20:19.48]It's probably going to be... Well, you'll see.
[20:24.52]Alien Carnival.
[20:27.53]What do you mean, Alien Carnival?
[20:28.67]What does that mean?
[20:33.51]Area 50... Wait, wait, wait.
[20:35.39]Hold on.
[20:36.87]Explain this to me.
[20:37.83]Remember, I get all of my fucking meme news from you guys.
[20:44.22]So I need to be dealt... What the hell?
[20:46.22]What is this Area 51 thing?
[20:47.46]I don't get it.
[20:49.45]I don't understand what this is.
[20:51.64]We're gonna, oh, Area 51, we'll go and find the aliens.
[20:56.44]I don't understand.
[20:59.72]People are planning to raid Area 51.
[21:09.73]That's it.
[21:10.49]That's the joke?
[21:12.79]Oh.
[21:12.89]Oh.
[21:15.60]So that's like a thing on Facebook that you sign up for and like five million people say like, yes, I'm gonna go.
[21:20.88]And just like your fucking birthday party that you do on Facebook, like three people show up.
[21:26.64]Like why the fuck did you accept the Facebook invite?
[21:29.80]Don't do that.
[21:31.15]Just ignore it.
[21:31.87]Just pretend like you didn't fucking see it.
[21:36.93]I would rather you pretend you didn't see it than say yes.
[21:40.23]By the way, you're gonna get liquidated if you fucking try to do that.

[22:21.14]We're gonna need those.
[22:22.32]The tents are set up.
[22:23.38]And they're gone.
[22:24.04]The person's gone.

[23:37.95]If you were the government, and people knew that Area 51 was like the jokey alien place,
[23:44.63]Don't you think that that would just be like a... Oh, yeah.
[23:49.00]Area 51.
[23:50.00]That's right, guys.
[23:50.80]Shh.
[23:52.86]Don't say anything.

[24:33.91]Today, we're gonna find out something real important.
[24:36.79]Real important to me, real important to you, real important to the social studies of your school.
[24:41.06]Uh, ask your professor, ask your teacher this, or a guardian.
[24:44.16]What happened to the dinosaurs?
[24:45.60]Anyways, you know?

[24:47.94]I mean, did they, did they, did they get extinct?
[24:51.27]Almost there.
[24:54.43]No preparation.
[25:03.60]Use my hammer to crack open the shells.
[25:07.60]This is the kind of power that I don't want to have.
[25:12.27]You want me to smash up these eggs?
[25:22.45]Easy!
[25:23.56]Frustrations!
[25:26.89]They're okay.
[25:30.67]This is one of the rarest things I've ever come across as an archaeologist.
[25:36.07]That wasn't right.
[25:36.91]That wasn't right.
[25:38.55]What the fuck?

[28:36.54]Why can't you just, like, be in, like... It's like, why can't I be riding on the back of the Triceratops?
[28:40.31]You know what I mean?

[29:51.77]Is that what they're suggesting?
[29:53.15]That has to be what they're suggesting, that you just got shit in your face.
[29:56.17]Like, when it splashes and hits the screen.
[29:58.91]Rated E for everyone.

[30:21.29]What's going on?
[30:22.63]No, I already... Spin over!
[30:31.96]You have any idea how much this wonder book cost me?
[30:35.86]You have any idea how much it cost for a wonder book?
[30:39.86]Five bucks.
[30:41.18]Yeah.
[30:42.22]It's fucking cheap as shit.
[30:47.69]That was five dollars.
[30:53.73]The games, on the other hand, were like twenty.
[30:58.25]How much are those right now?
[31:00.78]was like 10 years ago right in 2012 2013. have they appreciated in value or are they could I have like made like a ton of money with my wonder book no it's it depreciated yeah but
[31:32.31]It's selling for $15 on Amazon.
[31:34.13]So I got it for $5.
[31:36.31]$5, $10, $15.
[31:36.87]That's a two... That's like a 200% increase.
[31:40.47]I would have like 2 or 3x'd my money.
[31:42.51]That's a big deal.
[31:47.44]$4 plus shipping on eBay.
[31:48.48]Never mind.
[31:49.14]Okay.
[31:49.72]So I didn't make any money.
[31:51.98]I didn't make any theoretical money here.
[31:54.90]So that was Book of Spells.
[31:55.96]There's one more.
[31:56.68]Might as well just do the whole saga.
[32:00.63]There's Book of Potions.
[32:08.02]Wonder Book Book of Potions is the last one.
[32:20.25]And here it comes.
[32:25.27]This is the one where I wait.
[32:28.78]Do I actually do that?
[32:30.60]That doesn't sound very nice.
[32:38.35]Book of Potions.
[32:41.19]This is the most recent one.
[32:42.35]We did them in order.
[32:47.51]What a fucking sick intro.
[32:58.50]You didn't think we were going to play every single Wonder Book game?
[33:04.83]Let's make a potion.
[33:05.93]The cure for boils.
[33:07.57]Alright, so I gotta make this potion and he's gonna drink it?
[33:13.61]Crush snake fangs.
[33:14.96]It's Jerma.
[33:15.20]Pungent onions.
[33:27.36]dried nettles, a dash of flubberworm, mucus, and a sprinkle of ginger fruit.
[33:32.13]This is a lot of ingredients!
[33:34.35]Dude, why don't you just go to CVS and get fucking boil cream?
[33:39.30]Why do I have to do all this?
[33:41.77]They make, like, Neosporin.
[33:43.63]Oh, shit.
[33:43.91]No, no, no.
[33:44.89]Go this way.
[33:45.57]Get out of here, Dobby.
[33:46.85]You're tracking mud all over my wonder book.
[33:48.75]Get out of here, dude.
[33:49.29]Dobby, get off the book.
[33:51.17]Dobby, get out of here.
[34:06.99]What, page three?
[34:08.35]Oh yeah, he just stayed.
[34:10.27]Dobby!
[34:10.65]Oh shit!
[34:11.17]Dobby, get out of the potion!
[34:15.81]I don't think he's supposed to be here.
[34:18.80]Then this is fucked up.
[34:31.21]Okay.
[34:32.41]Am I making a potion or am I Looney Tunes style cooking Dobby in a pot?
[34:38.45]This is fucked up.
[34:39.49]Seasonal.
[34:48.94]This is evil.
[34:50.12]Alright, get him out.
[34:51.04]Get him out.
[34:51.60]Dobby, get out.
[34:53.18]Get out of the... Get out, please.
[34:54.78]Ooh.
[34:54.98]Ooh.
[35:03.64]Oh, that's fine.
[35:05.56]Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere.
[35:08.48]Not to worry.
[35:13.08]Relax.
[35:13.46]Say the same line again, please.
[35:15.62]Oh, that's fine.
[35:17.52]Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere.
[35:20.47]Not to worry.
[35:21.63]What a mess.
[35:23.03]Try to get some of it in the cauldron.
[35:25.17]Oh, that's fine.
[35:27.79]Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere.
[35:30.53]It just doesn't stop.
[35:31.89]What is in this?
[35:33.25]trying to get some of it in this thing is still going what a mess you need to be really careful when you're using your chopping tools because there's a chance that you might cut yourself somebody who's holding the knife okay I didn't write all the potions
[36:04.29]Watch.
[36:06.83]That's it, keep the heat there.
[36:10.83]There.
[36:11.53]Yes!
[36:13.09]Are you still with me?
[36:14.23]Press the move button to clip off some of the nettle.
[36:22.42]Hold the clipper's clue.
[36:24.18]Now we have our cure for boils.
[36:35.51]We still need that ingredient.
[36:36.97]Pick it up again.
[36:37.55]Oh, yeah, just dump the... What the fuck is wrong?
[36:45.66]That looks like a pepperoni pizza.
[36:47.48]It'll cure him.
[36:48.08]It'll get him in there.
[36:50.48]Just dunk him a little bit.
[36:54.60]Come on, Duffy, get in there.
[36:57.61]Dolphy, we're curing your fucking wars.
[37:02.39]I just don't give a fuck anymore.
[37:03.87]Like, I just don't.
[37:04.58]Look.
[37:04.68]That was sick.
[37:05.04]I- was that- was- hold on.
[37:06.38]What the fuck just- what was that?
[37:07.96]I should have made that a much bigger deal.
[37:10.52]That was a huge deal.
[37:22.24]There.
[37:23.32]Oh, dude, he's sucking my blood!
[37:25.06]Quite ingenious.
[37:26.74]Oh, how much is he gonna drink?
[37:28.06]After that close encounter, time to learn more.
[37:31.46]Okay.
[37:32.56]I just let these things drink.
[37:33.76]Hold on, that's a rare auto-signing.
[37:36.35]Auto-sighting, not signing.
[37:37.77]He's not, like, he's not, like, releasing a book.
[37:40.73]Look at, look at her.
[37:41.47]Like, rare auto-yawn in the corner.
[37:43.55]I didn't know he was in this video.
[37:44.97]What is this, on a couch?
[37:47.29]Juice?
[37:48.19]Put my hand down.
[37:51.29]There.
[37:52.41]Oh, dude, he's sucking my blood!
[37:54.95]Oh, how much is he gonna drink?
[38:00.52]Okay.
[38:01.64]I just let these things drink a bunch of my blood.
[38:03.86]Now I'm gonna kill him, mash him up, and put my blood in this potion.
[38:09.74]You wanna get arrested?
[38:11.04]That's how you get arrested.
[38:12.30]That's how you get the health inspector to be like, you're putting blood in your fucking food?
[38:16.30]Your blood?
[38:18.82]My restaurant's gonna be closed.
[38:22.03]Still a bit chunky.
[38:23.73]Give them another bash.
[38:25.05]My blood wasn't green.
[38:26.80]Go to it.
[38:30.14]Why is this implying that I had green blood?
[38:33.10]I don't have green blood.
[38:35.80]I'm pretty... My blood's red.
[38:40.45]Area 51, let's go.
[38:41.61]All you need is a wave of the wand to make it into a... Kid humor, there it is.
[38:51.49]I would still do that now.
[38:52.29]That's not kid humor.
[38:52.99]I would do that now.
[38:54.93]If that was sitting on my lap right now, I would do that right now.
[39:00.69]Now, use your wand.
[39:02.11]Pick up the fish and fling it towards him.
[39:08.94]That's it!
[39:12.65]How fucking dumb these really were.
[39:14.97]Stupid, that's covered in shrinking solution.
[39:21.01]He's just a little baby.
[39:23.89]He certainly won't stop us passing by now.
[39:26.09]Watch out for the knife.
[39:35.98]Can this chop?
[39:39.62]Careful.
[39:44.08]Unicorn!
[39:45.88]Boo!
[39:46.30]That's funny.
[39:53.44]You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time?
[39:56.74]I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material.
[39:59.55]I haven't even had a chance to drink my own fucking potions!
[40:02.95]That's changing right now.
[40:10.15]Whoa!
[40:12.27]Whoa, that's spicy.
[40:13.79]Woo!
[40:14.15]Woo!
[40:16.01]At first, I really didn't think I was going to like that, but man, that was pretty tasty.
[40:23.11]That's one of my favorite, that's one of my favorite old jokes.
[40:39.12]I do this like four times.
[40:43.15]How many times did I actually do that?
[40:46.69]I had to have used this same ambulance thing like three or four times.
[40:58.94]There's like so many people here to take, what happened to me?
[41:04.57]There's like three paramedics, like two firemen.
[41:08.17]A spit just went flying.
[41:09.79]I don't know if you caught that one, but it was gross.
[41:16.50]Neurostory Electrodump?
[41:18.56]Does it happen in that too?
[41:19.92]No, it doesn't.
[41:20.60]Does it?
[41:20.88]Hold on.
[41:23.59]Does it actually happen in that video?
[41:29.71]That video's kind of fucked up, isn't it?
[41:36.39]I remember this video being, like, strange.
[41:42.98]I forget.
[41:43.32]Let's watch it.
[41:49.64]This is right before Metal Gear Solid 5.
[41:52.62]I really tried to jump on the Metal Gear Solid 5 train.
[41:56.39]Because it was a big deal that that game was coming out.
[42:05.45]And I was like, hold on.
[42:06.91]Let me try to do something cool.
[42:09.40]And I thought it was funny because the story is like fucking... I don't think I could...
[42:16.13]Metal Gear Solid and kingdom hearts are the same game in regards to storylines they may as well just be the same exact story explain to me kingdom hearts storyline but replace the kingdom hearts characters with people from Metal Gear Solid and vice versa you'd have the same story once he got to Metal Gear Solid 2 and they started going that the last like hour-long cutscene
[42:43.19]May as well have been fucking Sora and Roxas.
[42:45.69]Like, playing rock, paper, scissors.
[42:48.50]Here we go.
[42:56.86]I forget this whole video.
[42:58.40]I hear it's a good game.
[43:00.34]I hear it's an incredible franchise.
[43:02.70]I haven't played Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16.
[43:05.78]I played the first one and I played the second one.
[43:08.24]It's true.
[43:08.92]I don't know the story.
[43:10.67]And it's become so complicated and so intertwined at this point, I seriously don't even know where I would even start.
[43:17.95]Dozens of hours of cutscenes, tons of reading.
[43:20.53]I don't got time to read.
[43:21.84]Who's got time to read nowadays, you know?
[43:24.24]So what I did is I picked up this.
[43:27.88]This is, got this online.
[43:31.64]a comprehensive Metal Gear NeuroStory ElectroDump.
[43:36.59]They have them for all kinds of things.
[43:37.77]This is for Metal Gear because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about.
[43:43.77]So that goes into the CD tray.
[43:45.91]I think it's just a standard disc.
[43:48.71]Now we put on the electrodes.
[43:51.53]And that goes there.
[43:52.73]Okay.
[43:56.61]Standard USB.
[43:57.89]It goes right in the back of your computer.
[44:00.29]Just like that.
[44:04.11]That should be it.
[44:07.68]Ow, my teeth!
[44:09.92]Ow!
[44:10.76]That's my favorite joke of the whole video.
[44:13.10]Okay.
[44:15.81]Let's all get hyped for Metal Gear Solid V.
[44:20.92]Get hype.
[44:21.92]Play button.
[44:23.16]Spoilers for Metal Gear!
[44:28.34]There's room for only one snake and one big boss.
[44:34.74]You'll ruin your eyes playing so close to the TV.
[44:43.80]Big boss was the boss.
[44:47.12]No, the boss was the boss and then big boss, big boss man took over.
[44:50.50]Because he had to kill her.
[44:51.20]Because the third game.
[44:52.48]Into the fifth game.
[44:53.26]Into the fourth game.
[44:54.00]Into the worst and second game.
[44:57.14]God damn it.
[45:00.50]I gotta watch it again.
[45:02.22]I gotta start over.
[45:03.14]I gotta start over.
[45:05.50]I'll get it this time.
[45:06.22]Because it was getting confusing.
[45:07.80]When they were all clones and shit.
[45:10.44]One more time.
[45:12.14]Get hype.
[45:13.74]Get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5.
[45:14.96]Get hype.
[45:16.35]AUTO!
[45:53.74]What's happening?
[45:55.10]Where am I?
[46:00.96]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:04.56]Metal Gear Solid story.
[46:08.85]I must not have hit play.
[46:09.83]I must have fallen asleep.
[46:10.83]Fuck.
[46:13.71]I got time.
[46:14.15]It's for the launch of Metal Gear.
[46:16.59]Metal Gear Solid 5, the launch party.
[46:26.21]I like that video.
[46:27.85]I like this video.
[46:33.70]There it is.
[46:34.26]That's the other time.
[46:41.50]How did I get like that?
[46:42.72]It's called... This... They filmed at different times.
[46:48.81]I think I stayed up really late for this one.
[46:54.78]I'm pretty pale.
[46:55.48]Yeah, because this is like obviously, look, this is very obviously during the day.
[46:59.44]Look in the corner.
[47:00.56]Right?
[47:00.74]Oh, we're going to watch my favorite video I've ever made.
[47:04.18]Yeah, this is my favorite video I think I've ever made.
[47:07.10]Yeah, I don't even need to, I don't care.
[47:08.32]This is streamer's choice.
[47:09.22]We're watching the basketball video.
[47:11.60]People did, when this first released, people were like, what the fuck is this?
[47:16.50]And let me tell you something about this video.
[47:18.60]This is no, I did not cheat in this video.
[47:21.57]People thought that cheats existed to do this.
[47:24.61]Oh, no, they didn't.
[47:25.75]No, they did not.
[47:26.47]I was on a call, I think, with, like, MLC Stealth and Star, maybe.
[47:30.91]I remember at the time, I was over and over and over again throwing the fucking ball from across the entire fucking court over and over and over until I captured it and edited it together.
[47:44.24]It took, like, 12 fucking hours to do this.
[47:47.92]You can't do this in this game.
[47:49.80]This is real.
[47:50.36]We're watching it right now.
[47:53.12]Can I even click it?
[47:55.69]People thought I cheated on that one.
[47:57.10]No, no, no.
[47:58.02]You can't do that in this game.
[48:00.20]You'll know what I'm talking about very soon.
[48:02.52]That's my favorite video, I think, ever.
[48:04.00]I love this video.
[48:04.62]Let's watch it.
[48:09.57]And I remember when I was putting it together, I was like, this is a sports video.
[48:15.02]Is anybody going to give a shit about this video?
[48:18.25]And then I was like, whatever.
[48:20.50]I thought it was funny.
[48:21.78]And that's all that really mattered at that point.
[48:23.44]I was like, I think it's funny.
[48:25.24]I'm going to put it up.
[48:25.92]Alright, let me get it.
[48:29.28]Hold on.
[48:30.26]Move out of the way.
[48:35.68]I fucking love this video.
[48:43.50]And editing this together was hell, too, because I had to make it look like it was really happening.
[48:51.25]There you go.
[48:51.59]This is your insight.
[48:52.68]This is not done with cheats.
[48:54.42]This is the real deal.
[49:00.08]Nice hit!
[49:01.28]Nice hit!
[49:04.16]Today's video, we're going to open up a box on camera.
[49:08.27]Oh, I've already done it.
[49:09.81]I've already done it.
[49:11.01]Out of the arena and look out, look out.
[49:12.17]Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, watch out!
[49:14.56]Mayo coming up the front of the court over the Boston Celtics sign.
[49:17.32]Passing it over to Knight.
[49:18.22]Knight layup.
[49:18.88]That's two points for Milwaukee.
[49:21.99]Now we've got Gabe Gloom and DeGrossi.
[49:24.23]Well, that's what he typically does.
[49:26.11]And it's in.
[49:27.21]Another three points for the Boston Celtics.
[49:30.35]A deficit like this is going to be hard to come back from for the Milwaukee Brewers.
[49:34.03]But maybe they can mount something.
[49:35.51]They need to get some type of offense and keep the defense alive.
[49:39.20]Oh, what a fake.
[49:39.82]They're passing it over to Sanders.
[49:40.96]Two points for Milwaukee again.
[49:42.92]You've got to give Milwaukee some credit here, though.
[49:45.64]They've showed perseverance this entire game.
[49:48.04]How do you go up against a team like the Celtics of 1997?
[49:50.29]I'm not entirely sure to gross you now.
[49:53.21]Passing technique.
[49:54.27]That's another three points.
[49:56.03]If you can hear the speechlessness in my voice, it's because I need... Somebody call a nuclear physicist right now and ask them how this is even possible to score three points every single possession the entire season.
[50:09.46]You've got Gabe, the glue man, DeGrossi.
[50:11.64]They gave him that name because he's got hands like glue and he can throw the ball so well.
[50:16.13]And he was able to teach the entire team how to do this.
[50:20.07]And I just don't understand.
[50:21.51]And DeGrossi's not going to get the ball to Wallace.
[50:23.41]Wallace is going to do it now, and that's going to be three points.
[50:25.99]They've never missed one time the whole season.
[50:29.37]I haven't casted a game from the Celtics, but this is the first time I've casted a Celtics game.
[50:33.61]And I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most remarkable basketball games I have ever encountered in my entire 67 years on the planet.
[50:43.04]So now we're going to just try to calm down here.
[50:45.04]How do you calm down?
[50:46.18]How do you calm down when something like that happens?
[50:49.30]How do you calm down?
[50:51.08]How am I supposed to?
[50:52.94]Knight's got the ball.
[50:53.60]Now we have Knight on the Milwaukee team.
[50:56.13]He's going to try to come up forward.
[50:56.97]He's going to do a jump shot right at the pan and he misses.
[50:59.05]But Frank Pizza's got the ball.
[51:00.21]Frank Pizza with a toss.
[51:01.09]This is for real.
[51:02.80]Oh!
[51:04.77]He missed it.
[51:05.73]Frank Pizza just missed the first shot of the entire season.
[51:10.87]And that's just unbelievable.
[51:12.09]I really can't believe that.
[51:13.27]Out of all the things we've seen here tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you I did not expect Frank Pizza to be the guy to ruin the streak of the Boston Celtics.
[51:20.78]But can we start it again?
[51:22.52]We're going to start it again.
[51:24.00]Start that counter at zero and add one to it, ladies and gentlemen, because that is the first of many from these Boston Celtics.
[51:30.29]They are making a speed leave again, which is something that their GM over and over again has said in interviews.
[51:37.55]Dan Bringus, we caught up with him earlier this afternoon.
[51:41.32]Look, I'm gonna say the same thing I've said like 12 times now.
[51:45.15]I fucking hate this job, and I hate this whole fucking organization, and this whole throw the ball as hard as you can from the back of the court was a joke to get me fired.
[51:55.20]And it didn't work.
[51:56.37]Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen.
[52:25.85]As we see the players all take off into their respective locker rooms, I'm going to have to give the Player of the Game Award to Gabe Glumandagrossi.
[52:34.71]That's right, the fan favorite.
[52:36.11]You all know him.
[52:36.69]You all love him.
[52:37.63]I really, truly think he is one of the best players to ever live.
[52:41.68]And honestly, I hope to God nothing bad happens to this guy like 10 years from now.
[52:50.96]Frank Pizza missing the first shot of the whole season.
[52:55.70]Oh, it was worth it.
[52:56.90]It was worth it.
[52:57.66]I remember like eight hours into trying to get this to happen, being like, this ain't worth it.
[53:04.68]This is not fucking worth me doing this.
[53:07.20]It was, absolutely.
[53:08.32]I'm not entirely sure to gross you now.
[53:10.22]Passing technique.
[53:12.00]Doing that from across the court in these, and I don't know which one it was, NBA like 2K, like 15 or 14, whatever it was.
[53:21.12]You can't do that.
[53:24.04]That's so rare in life and in games.
[53:29.84]Oh, it was like one in fucking 50.
[53:31.50]It happened.
[53:32.83]Something like that.
[53:35.25]Another three points.
[53:36.81]If you can hear the speechlessness in my voice, it's because I need, somebody call a nuclear.
[53:42.06]You couldn't make them.
[53:43.22]Physicist right now.
[53:44.30]You had to like play through my like career mode or something to get them to build up, right?
[53:48.70]You can only make one person.
[53:50.10]And ask them.
[53:51.23]Oh, somebody call.
[53:52.09]How is this even possible to score three points every single possession the entire season?
[53:57.93]You've got Gabe the glue man to grossy.
[54:00.09]They gave him.
[54:00.81]These are all edits, right?
[54:01.69]So here's the thing.
[54:03.29]This down here.
[54:05.05]I mean, obviously that's a fake scoreboard.
[54:07.45]It's covering up the real scores, because this jumps around.
[54:09.63]I wish I could move this out of the way so you could see.
[54:12.56]But, like, for instance, right here, what you're seeing right now... This is... This is a completely different cut.
[54:23.15]This is a different clip.
[54:25.01]Because I had to Frankenstein them all together to have it make any sense.
[54:28.93]So...
[54:30.70]Every time somebody on their team scores a basket, it's a new clip after that.
[54:42.16]But once I went all in on it, I was like, I have to do that.
[54:44.48]I love this.
[54:44.82]I love this video.
[54:45.72]That was like, it was worth it.
[54:59.10]uh compare the scores on the hoop are there scores on the hoop oh 24 right okay so 24 points they've never from the celtics one of the most remarkable basketball game that's true that's the that's the shot clock that's not the points that's the shot clock I yeah okay alright so what's what's up what's up next
[55:26.92]I've picked them.
[55:28.10]Let's see.
[55:28.64]Let's get some... Patch notes?
[55:34.37]Yeah, patch notes.
[55:35.29]We'll do patch notes.
[55:40.27]This is actually one of the last videos I made.
[55:42.91]Yeah, I think this... Is this the last video I made?
[55:48.96]Yeah.
[55:53.46]I think so, right?
[55:54.60]Let's see.
[55:58.86]Because it was Jerma Rumble Live was after that, right?
[56:07.54]Yeah.
[56:09.98]We are about to witness right now the last, like, at my desk video I ever made.
[56:21.51]So I feel a little bit... And it's interesting because it's kind of a...
[56:25.57]It's kind of like a culmination of how I felt about YouTube at the time, weirdly enough.
[56:32.11]But you'll see what I'm talking about.
[56:33.49]Hold on.
[56:40.69]Alright, here we go.
[56:49.23]This is called Patch Notes.
[56:52.49]Patch Notes.
[56:59.76]So I feel a little bit bad that I haven't been covering as many games as I used to on this channel.
[57:05.12]I used to go over patch notes, game updates, how I felt about them, and I haven't done it in a very long time.
[57:11.86]So I wanted to play catch up with myself, in a sense, and go over all of them.
[57:17.26]All the patches and updates that I wanted to cover that I didn't get a chance to cover over the last three years.
[57:22.64]So this one's probably gonna be quite a long one.
[57:24.36]We're gonna go over all these patches,
[57:26.45]And we're going to start with Team Fortress 2, the invasion update.
[57:30.61]Get yourself excited.
[57:31.57]Are you excited?
[57:32.19]Well, you should be.
[57:33.09]We're talking about patches here.
[57:34.75]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the patch video.
[57:37.47]So Team Fortress... Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
[57:42.17]You're fast-forwarding right now.
[57:43.49]I just want to make sure your fingers hold.
[57:45.73]You're doing that intentionally?
[57:46.87]Is that another mistake?
[57:49.15]It added a drop-down area to Red's last, and adjusted lighting in various areas.
[57:54.25]What's interesting, though, is they finally fixed the DirectX settings on light poles.
[57:58.48]Remember how annoying that was with light poles?
[58:00.04]Okay, listen, I... You don't have to skip all of Overwatch, because that was a pretty big deal.
[58:03.12]Game's coming out soon.
[58:11.68]Look, this video took me like three months to make, so I don't want to be like a dick about it, but if you could just pick something so I could at least feel like it mattered.
[58:20.09]We need one for Nosgoth here.
[58:21.81]Sonic Boom actually finally got the nerf it deserved.
[58:25.05]It's now under eight seconds for a cooldown.
[58:27.34]And they fixed a couple of crashes.
[58:28.86]The desktop launcher, the crash on exit.
[58:31.18]Thank God we can now not have to deal with that.
[58:33.62]And the game will never turn on ever again after May 31st.
[58:36.02]It's true.
[58:38.12]Moving right along, we've got another patch...
[58:39.97]Look, there's no reason for you to go this fast.
[58:42.85]Okay, I'm just gonna be very Frank with you.
[58:44.66]Take your finger off that button right now.
[58:46.88]Right now, if you have any respect.
[58:50.59]Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?
[58:53.99]I'm just gonna hang out.
[58:54.75]I'll be over here on my phone.
[58:56.35]Got a couple new apps to check out.
[58:58.49]I downloaded FaceSwap.
[59:00.21]You know, FaceSwap, you can do it with your dog, and it's really funny.
[59:03.13]I got a new keyboard app, too.
[59:04.23]I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[59:05.77]It's called, like, Key, uh, something Key.
[59:07.53]And you can make a little tune, and it's pretty cool.
[59:09.89]Uh, I got a couple new games for you as well.
[59:11.43]What the hell is this?
[59:14.01]What are these?
[59:14.77]Hold on.
[59:14.97]Pause the video for a second.
[59:16.15]Pause it!
[59:24.14]You're in a different video right now.
[59:26.12]I haven't even made this video yet.
[59:28.16]You are at least 20 to 30 uploads in the future.
[59:31.33]So you're going to listen to me very closely and very carefully.
[59:34.55]You're going to rewind a few months and you're going to stop, okay?
[59:40.32]Very simple instruction.
[59:43.17]There you go.
[59:44.21]Right here.
[59:44.57]Right here.
[59:44.91]Stop.
[59:45.37]Stop.
[59:45.57]Stop.
[59:45.75]Stop.
[59:45.91]Doesn't matter where.
[59:46.95]Stop right here.
[59:48.07]In fact, you might.
[59:48.61]In fact, you might.
[59:49.73]Yeah, I'm overlapping here.
[59:51.53]Pull it forward like two inches or so on the bar.
[59:54.99]Almost there.
[59:56.05]One more.
[59:57.47]Got it.
[59:57.85]Perfect.
[59:59.09]These are my patch notes.
[60:00.69]And these just came out today.
[60:02.26]I haven't even seen these yet.
[60:03.22]You picked a perfect place to stop.
[60:05.50]So let's see what they changed.
[60:08.92]They're actually shrinking me again.
[60:10.36]This is the second time it's happened.
[60:11.38]We strongly feel Jerma's current height has been causing performance issues.
[60:14.70]He couldn't easily fit into a clown car.
[60:17.00]With this change, clown car videos are now much more accessible.
[60:21.06]I don't want to do clown car videos.
[60:23.26]What are they talking about?
[60:24.86]My lumberjack outfit is going to get removed too.
[60:27.38]Now that is bullshit.
[60:28.96]I'm keeping my lumberjack outfit on.
[60:31.68]What else we got?
[60:32.20]This patch is fucking terrible so far.
[60:35.68]40% more vacation vlogs.
[60:38.74]No.
[60:40.02]I'm not doing vacation videos.
[60:41.81]No way.
[60:43.21]I would rather do a hundred clown car videos than one vacation video.
[60:47.59]So, opting out of this one, as you could say, it's downloading.
[60:53.03]When did I do that?
[60:53.87]I didn't press any button.
[60:54.61]I didn't accept anything.
[60:55.51]There was no cancel or anything.
[60:58.00]Nothing's working here.
[60:59.58]Do I seriously have to rip out my Ethernet cable?
[61:02.52]I do.
[61:03.28]I don't want this patch.
[61:05.58]Hold on a second.
[61:07.55]I had all these installed, and I'm connected to my whole damn house.
[61:11.67]I think that's it.
[61:13.19]Is it?
[61:15.50]God damn it!
[61:17.82]Ow!
[61:19.16]Ow!
[61:20.56]That's the cable.
[61:21.94]I gotta put that back in.
[61:22.68]I wanna watch Better Call Saul season two.
[61:26.56]I can't... Hello?
[61:29.26]Look, you are gonna have to call back at a different time.
[61:33.30]I'm in the middle of some shit right now, and I need...
[61:37.21]Look, please put me on the do not call list.
[61:39.89]Fucking asshole.
[61:47.08]That's not it.
[61:48.76]I think I might throw up.
[61:49.60]I hope not.
[61:50.06]What is this?
[61:51.44]What is that?
[61:55.30]Why do I have a sneeze switch?
[61:56.84]This is it right here.
[61:59.30]Whoa, colors.
[61:59.76]Gone.
[62:07.08]I can't see anything.
[62:07.78]I'm blind.
[62:09.42]I must have pulled out the HDMI.
[62:11.65]Oh boy, oh boy.
[62:14.13]Somebody's gonna have to call.
[62:15.15]Where's my mom?
[62:15.57]Where's my phone?
[62:16.23]Mom?
[62:17.03]Fuck.
[62:18.14]Where is it?
[62:18.60]I gotta... How much time do I have on that?
[62:20.24]I don't know.
[62:20.68]I can't tell.
[62:21.60]I can't see.
[62:35.22]actually scary videos this is a weird feeling I kind of just feel like I don't exist I can't hear I can't see
[63:15.70]It happened!
[63:20.02]And that was the last video I ever made besides Jerma Rumble Live.
[63:26.73]Interesting.
[63:35.46]We got the bad ending on Jerma985 apparently.
[63:41.70]DoorCube?
[63:42.20]Alright, we'll do DoorCube.
[63:43.26]Funny thing about DoorCube, DoorCube is claimed right now.
[63:47.57]This video, apparently I don't own it anymore.
[63:54.15]I don't know why.
[63:57.63]This video has been demonetized and DMCA'd by I don't know what.
[64:01.75]I think maybe the ending sequence?
[64:03.43]But I paid for that.
[64:07.41]I couldn't figure it out because all the things were legally obtained.
[64:15.60]This is... I'll give some context to people that don't know about this.
[64:19.66]So, somewhere in, like, 2012... Let me get bigger for this.
[64:26.19]Somewhere in, like, 2012 to, like, 2016, there was, like, a... As of, like, two or three years ago, there was this craze of opening loot boxes on camera.
[64:38.51]There was, like, loot crate, and...
[64:42.68]They all had the same fucking name, okay?
[64:45.32]There was, like, 2014.
[64:47.71]Yeah, but this trickled all the way into, like, late 2015, too, I remember.
[64:54.87]There was, like, five of them.
[64:58.45]And tons of people, tons of, like, YouTubers and streamers were, like, doing sponsorships for these.
[65:05.52]And I kind of, I guess this is just
[65:12.49]how I felt about it.
[65:21.76]In a way.
[65:25.32]Loot box.
[65:27.80]Yeah, it's weird, because we went from opening loot boxes to then opening loot boxes to then opening loot boxes.
[65:35.43]In real life, in games, everyone was trying to jump on this craze of
[65:41.87]Gambling for Mega Man t-shirts.
[65:44.02]You know what I mean?
[65:44.60]Like... Oh, by the way, a funny thing about this video.
[65:48.86]At the very end, I was going to pull out a Mega Man sticker.
[65:52.30]And go, oh, Mega Man!
[65:53.66]Mega Man sticker!
[65:55.32]But I never did it.
[65:56.82]I feel like that would be too obvious.
[66:00.82]So, let's go.
[66:04.98]Here comes Dork Cube.
[66:11.62]Let's see what happens in this video.
[66:15.52]Hey, what's happening everybody?
[66:17.02]Jermock here with something a little different today.
[66:20.36]This is not my typical video that I would make, but I decided to do it because I've been approached by this company.
[66:28.09]They're a super cool bunch of guys over at Dork Cube and it is...
[66:31.82]The Dork Cube!
[66:32.88]Take a look at it.
[66:33.92]This is a monthly subscription box that comes in the mail, and you buy it, you open it, and there's all kinds of nerdy, geeky, epic, kind of funny gamer culture type stuff inside.
[66:45.59]And I thought I should get one, and just open it for you, and, you know, give these guys a shout, give these guys a shout-out, and give you guys a shout-out, and we'll give them a shout-out.
[66:54.39]This is Dork Cube!
[66:56.04]Uh, I don't know what's inside of it.
[66:57.68]I have no idea.
[66:58.32]They sent it to me, so we're gonna see, uh, what's inside.
[67:00.97]A link will be in the description.
[67:02.77]Uh, if you want, uh, 2% off your next order, it's $20.
[67:06.45]So, save you a little bit of cash, you know, save you guys, we're looking out for you guys, you know what I mean?
[67:11.09]Gotta...
[67:13.31]Alright, you know, let's make this, let's make this a little interesting.
[67:15.47]How about that?
[67:16.59]Right when the box opens, how about everybody writes hashtag in the comments, loot get, you know what I mean?
[67:22.32]Like we got loot, you know, that's what we'll do.
[67:25.16]So in the comment section below, right when this opens, everybody say, loot get!
[67:30.69]There's blood in the box!
[67:32.95]There's blood inside this box!
[67:50.57]This video, I no longer own this video.
[67:52.87]It was claimed.
[67:56.31]Is that the Dr. Phil song?
[67:57.77]Is it the Dr. Phil song?
[68:01.46]The box was just... It is, isn't it?
[68:07.62]No, no, no, no.
[68:08.74]This is like a royalty-free song.
[68:13.39]Who claimed this video?
[68:16.29]It was for the song.
[68:17.75]Wait a minute.
[68:25.58]That's not it, right?
[68:35.01]I did not get claimed by Dr. Joe.
[69:03.07]That's not the same song.
[69:05.89]One of them is like a shitty pretend ripoff of the other one, I think.
[69:11.93]No, that wasn't Dr. Phil.
[69:15.35]But yeah.
[69:16.75]That was Dorku.
[69:24.31]The sound it makes?
[69:25.71]Oh god.
[69:26.45]Do we have to fucking listen to this video?
[69:33.69]The sound it makes.
[69:39.05]No.
[69:40.43]Oh, God.
[69:41.23]I fucking forgot about this video.
[69:47.25]This video is so meaningless.
[69:56.55]This was like the state of making a TF2 video after making like 200 of them.
[70:08.01]Alright, here we go.
[70:08.97]This is called The Sound It Makes.
[70:17.84]Okay, alright.

[70:50.03]That's the scout.
[70:50.55]That's the scout.
[70:55.03]What is the TF2 sound?
[70:57.87]That was just you.
[70:59.97]That wasn't the TF2.
[71:00.49]I thought you were going to get like an actual sound clip.
[71:02.91]No, no, no.
[71:03.37]Of a sound.
[71:04.13]What was it?
[71:06.49]I don't know.
[71:07.55]What is that sound?
[71:08.79]You don't know what that is?
[71:10.29]No, I don't know what that is.
[71:11.74]Yeah, cut it.
[71:12.84]Cut the music.
[71:13.60]No, it was the mini century.
[71:15.42]I don't know how you didn't get that.
[71:16.74]That's not what it sounds like.
[71:18.36]Now, you see, I disagree, but not going to start an argument about this.
[71:23.10]That's not the sound it makes.
[71:23.98]That's not the sound it makes.
[71:24.94]That is the sound it makes.
[71:25.84]It's rhythmic.
[71:26.41]It doesn't go...
[71:27.57]No, that is the sound.
[71:28.43]I'm gonna prove it to you right now.
[71:29.51]You want to hear?

[73:02.27]It's just going... It's not shooting.
[73:04.23]It's...

[74:26.28]Yeah, and we're going to see who's right and who's wrong.
[74:29.18]I think it goes...

[74:57.30]Did you hear that?
[74:58.84]You heard it, didn't you?
[75:01.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[75:02.76]It never did that before.
[75:03.78]Why is it doing that now?
[75:04.68]It's doing it.
[75:05.60]It's not doing it.
[75:06.78]You can't have my bananas.
[75:07.92]I just bought them.
[75:08.74]Those are my bananas.
[75:09.68]I'm taking them from you.
[75:10.34]I'm going to have to wash my dishes again.
[75:15.83]Look at all these.
[75:16.39]Look at all these de-de-dees I'm getting.
[75:19.79]Oh, you think it's going to work?
[75:21.17]I forgot.
[75:21.69]What is going on in here?
[75:22.61]That's me.
[75:23.53]I'm the medic.
[75:24.87]What?
[75:26.11]I'm the medic.
[75:26.67]Oh, you're this medic.
[75:28.84]The hit sounds.
[75:30.44]Things in your brain just don't add up right away, do they?
[75:33.16]No.
[75:35.16]Hey, I'm this medic.
[75:37.86]Oh, you're this medic.
[75:38.80]Alright.
[75:43.03]Well, for the second part of this video.
[75:44.65]That's a satisfy.
[75:46.13]For the second part of this video, I need you to be on my team.
[75:49.23]Okay.
[75:50.11]This is part two.
[75:50.83]Join your team.
[75:51.81]This is part two of sounds.
[75:54.71]How do they make them?
[75:58.24]so for part two quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet what sound is that in the game TF2 uh that is no sound in TF2 you just screamed for like 12 seconds oh that's not a sound that's you great joke I think I already made it no that sound isn't TF2 oh really what what was that sound it's you have to guess you have to figure it out so you're telling me there is on this map mine at least was close
[76:23.14]Yours was nothing.
[76:25.30]Mine was close enough.
[76:26.30]Mine was really fucking close.
[76:28.98]No, that sound is part of the ecosystem.
[76:34.21]Is it the cart?
[76:37.21]Did I win?
[76:38.15]No, it's a weapon.
[76:40.67]We were only doing weapons.
[76:42.23]Like you did the weapon slinger.
[76:44.07]Do it again for me.
[76:44.75]It's a cat stretching.
[76:49.03]It's different every time.
[76:51.55]Did I get it?
[76:53.81]That is not a Saturn TF2.
[76:55.57]I'm sorry.
[76:56.59]Yeah, no, it's a gun.
[76:59.59]Rocket launcher.
[77:00.71]No.
[77:01.77]Grenade launcher.
[77:02.69]No.
[77:03.47]Cold.
[77:05.85]Scattergun.
[77:07.17]No.
[77:07.59]No, no, no, no, no.
[77:08.65]You're not thinking the right way.
[77:09.78]Katana.
[77:10.96]No.
[77:12.10]What the fuck is it, then?
[77:13.04]It's a... I mean, it doesn't have to kill people.
[77:15.61]The Huntsman.
[77:16.21]The Huntsman.
[77:16.61]The Huntsman.
[77:17.37]Oh.
[77:18.23]That was pretty good.
[77:19.91]Lock and load.
[77:20.83]No, this is... Crit's Creek.
[77:21.97]Crit's Creek.
[77:22.35]Yes.
[77:22.45]Yes.
[77:22.75]Yes.
[77:23.27]God, it was obvious.
[77:25.23]Dang, how did I not get that?
[77:26.75]I know.
[77:26.99]It doesn't hurt people.
[77:27.97]That was the clue.
[77:28.87]I know.
[77:29.26]The hurting's not as good as the hurting's not as good.
[77:31.38]The hurting's not as good as the healing's not as good.
[77:34.60]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[77:37.80]Wow, that...
[77:39.81]That sounds absolutely nothing like what you did at all.
[77:43.99]No, that's exactly what it is.
[77:45.23]Like the first initial activation, it starts off like that and it goes down.
[77:50.43]Okay.
[77:51.33]Well, we got that mystery solved.
[77:54.11]I'm going to go ahead and play some Demoknight for the remainder of the video.
[77:57.41]And then end the video.
[78:08.97]What a YouTuber.
[78:11.35]Pretty good YouTuber.
[78:15.10]Alright, what's next?
[78:17.76]My first Dark Souls video.
[78:19.60]Holy shit.
[78:21.60]This is... Oh, yeah, this is great.
[78:25.12]What a great idea.
[78:29.43]The best part about this video is I had no idea how to play Dark Souls at all.
[78:35.54]I was one of those people that just started to play it because it was a new game that came out.
[78:43.02]I didn't understand anything about it.
[78:44.78]I didn't fucking get it at all.
[78:46.30]I thought the game sucked.
[78:49.50]I thought it was a shitty game.
[78:51.36]I was like, this is a dumb game.
[78:52.52]Like, it's crappy.
[78:53.86]I didn't get it.
[78:55.96]I really didn't.
[78:56.59]I, like, didn't get it at all.
[78:57.43]And we're going to find out why.
[78:59.95]This is a buried video, I think, somewhere.
[79:03.77]Does anybody have the link to that one?
[79:05.47]Because this is old.
[79:06.73]I'm not sure how many people have even seen this video.
[79:10.75]I can't even find it.
[79:17.93]Oh, man.
[79:18.87]Oh, man.
[79:19.31]This is going to be bad.
[79:20.79]Oh, no.
[79:21.57]Oh, my God.
[79:22.64]Look at the thumbnail on this video.
[79:32.01]Hold on.
[79:33.65]I want to show the image of this on screen.
[79:35.71]Don't, nobody, nobody click it.
[79:36.77]Don't click it.
[79:45.51]Hold on a second.
[79:53.03]Here's the thumbnail for this video.
[79:56.45]I am not ready for this.
[79:57.85]I really am not.
[79:59.71]What am I clicking on this for?
[80:06.67]This video is like in eight and a half minutes.
[80:21.71]This is not, this is the, I wasn't doing that ironically.
[80:30.01]That was me saying like, Oh my God.
[80:36.19]Oh, when was this video made?
[80:38.28]Six, seven years ago?
[80:39.66]Seven years ago.
[80:46.10]I'm gonna hate this video.
[80:47.40]This is gonna be like Modern Warfare 3 tier of video, I think.
[80:56.57]And it's the title of this video.
[80:58.47]Why is the title this?
[81:01.33]Look at the title of this fucking video.
[81:03.37]Hold on.
[81:04.09]What is wrong with me?
[81:07.95]Is this the title?
[81:18.52]The title of this video is Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition in brackets haha dot dot dot oh god dash uncensored Jerma end bracket
[81:36.07]Just in case you were curious.

[88:16.84]Oh, that does so much more damage.
[88:19.60]So remember, this is important to note.
[88:20.90]This is very important extra commentary here.
[88:23.14]Can you imagine...
[88:25.10]somebody doing this now imagine you went to a uh Twitch stream right now somebody's just playing Dark Souls for the first time and this is what they're doing you'd be like what year is it right now he never changed I it's only been like seven years hasn't been that long you do this guys
[88:55.19]I'm talking about in Dark Souls.
[88:58.56]If somebody were to play Dark Souls now and like walk around with the tutorial knife and get killed by like the skinless ghouls out here.
[89:08.04]Like five times.
[89:11.89]Horde or Alliance?
[89:13.23]Alliance.
[89:14.63]Horde to begin with and then Alliance.
[89:21.45]Literally, what do you mean me?
[89:24.80]I did fucking great in the Dark Souls games on these streams.
[89:36.92]Two weeks ago, what?
[89:39.88]Hold on, are you guys really trying to compare having random bosses around every corner to starting Dark Souls for the first time ever in 2013?
[89:57.82]Horrid, but then I... I went Alliance because my friends played Alliance.
[90:02.26]So much better.
[90:03.02]Oh, this game just became so much easier.
[90:07.20]Holy sh... Come on!
[90:10.68]No!
[90:11.62]Dude!
[90:13.04]No!
[90:13.22]Holy shit, I can't fucking believe it.
[90:15.28]I'm getting chased!
[90:16.35]This is like death number eight.
[90:17.39]I'm getting chased!
[90:18.09]I don't even know what this does, but I'm drinking it.
[90:20.41]I don't know what this does.
[90:22.75]But I'm going to drink it.
[90:25.53]What does that even do?
[90:26.27]I can't even do it.
[90:29.15]I pressed down.
[90:30.05]You can't get me while I'm jumping.
[90:31.59]I know, I want my shield back.
[90:32.51]I'm more... I like the shield better.
[90:34.97]Oh my... I wasn't like... I wasn't even... I don't even know what... Look at... I'm getting chased.
[90:41.45]I'm getting chased.
[90:42.55]I don't even know what this does, but I'm drinking it.
[90:44.65]Holy shit.
[90:45.63]What does that even do?
[90:50.41]I can't even do it.
[90:51.29]The guy that played two weeks ago?
[90:54.27]You can't get me while I'm jumping.
[90:55.87]No, I want my shield back.
[90:56.85]The guy that doesn't know how to drink an Estus is on the same level as the mod guy two weeks ago.
[91:01.44]I wasn't even locking onto enemies.
[91:03.16]I was just flailing around like a- Holy shit, Tingey just gave 20- Tingey, you've given like 150 community subs the last week.
[91:12.08]Thank you for the 20 community subs, Tingey.
[91:15.84]That is a shitload of money.
[91:17.42]A shitload more subs.
[91:19.59]Thank you.
[91:21.85]That's a lot.
[91:24.06]Who was I talking to when I recorded this?
[91:28.42]Nobody.
[91:29.54]I was just like this, except there was nobody in the chat room.
[91:35.64]I just sat there and just did it.
[91:39.31]Yes, I am stalling and pausing and stopping this video.
[91:42.79]Idiot.
[91:44.95]Give me my lost power.
[91:46.91]And this time, we're gonna do lost... Lost power is the equivalent of
[91:54.49]your parents calling every console you own a Nintendo.
[91:58.25]Just to be clear about that.
[92:18.36]Critical hit from behind.
[92:19.10]How do I delete somebody else's video?
[92:20.04]Let's get behind this guy.
[92:20.74]Come on.
[92:20.90]That's my video.
[92:22.04]There it is.
[92:23.68]Oh, how's your back?
[92:26.90]Now this guy... This guy is dead.
[92:29.99]Alright, buddy?
[92:31.03]I'm prepared.
[92:31.69]I played for a little bit.
[92:32.87]I know how the game works.
[92:34.35]Let's go!
[92:36.09]Yeah!
[92:37.47]Get locked on.
[92:38.31]Come on.
[92:39.03]You want me to do a little dance?
[92:40.51]Oh, dance, baby.
[92:41.53]Get locked on.
[92:43.03]That hurts still.
[92:43.69]It's alright.
[92:44.13]We're good.
[92:45.89]Yeah, what you got?
[92:46.57]You ain't got nothing!
[92:49.57]Hey, look, I learned how to play the game.
[92:52.13]It only took me like 25 minutes.
[92:54.61]Bullshit.
[92:55.85]That's a lie.
[92:57.39]That's the biggest lie I've ever said.
[92:59.11]Look at this guy.
[92:59.91]Holy shit.
[93:00.23]Oh my god.
[93:02.55]Oh god.
[93:04.45]20 minutes.
[93:08.71]No, dude, come on.
[93:11.09]I was trying to make a joke about what he looked like and he just...
[93:18.49]Let's go, you big ugly bitch.
[93:20.71]When does this, like, stop?
[93:22.40]Let's go, let's go.
[93:23.90]Oh, lord!
[93:26.42]Get smashed!
[93:28.12]Whoa!
[93:28.72]Whoa!
[93:30.00]Is that the same audio clip?
[93:31.98]I think it was.
[93:34.34]Get smashed!
[93:36.04]Whoa!
[93:36.66]Whoa!
[93:37.26]Lord!
[93:38.12]It is!
[93:39.44]Get smashed!
[93:41.16]Whoa!
[93:41.76]Whoa!
[93:44.06]I don't think I was, like, I don't think I did that.
[93:47.43]No, I didn't.
[93:53.55]I need two for this.
[93:54.33]Hold on.
[93:57.05]Oh, Lord!
[93:59.63]Get smashed!
[94:01.33]Whoa!
[94:01.95]Whoa!
[94:02.79]It's different.
[94:04.23]But somehow the same.
[94:07.25]Can I break these... Maybe if you break these things, I get, like, items of health or something.
[94:11.30]Oh, he's stuck.
[94:12.62]Get away from me!
[94:13.44]Can I punch him in, like, his bum?
[94:21.02]I hit him in, like, his thigh, his leg thigh.
[94:23.18]That didn't make any sense, but I'm gonna beat him.
[94:26.08]Holy!
[94:26.36]Oh, I thought he was gonna belly flop.
[94:28.02]He is gonna belly flop me!
[94:31.79]No.
[94:32.07]How do I drink these flasks?
[94:34.15]How do I drink a damn flask?
[94:37.31]Escape!
[94:38.19]Dodge through his stomach!
[94:41.30]Alright, I need to figure out how to drink this stuff.
[94:44.26]Recover lost power.
[94:45.24]Take it.
[94:47.52]Is this like a potion?
[94:48.44]Like a healing potion?
[94:50.20]Where's my shield?
[94:50.96]I didn't even have my shield.
[94:53.68]No, put it back on.
[94:55.52]Um, hold on, timeout.
[94:57.52]There is no timeout.
[94:58.78]There is no timeout.
[95:00.41]You can't pause it.
[95:06.19]Hit him!
[95:06.93]Keep hitting him.
[95:08.13]I'm hitting him right in his butthole.
[95:09.69]No pausing.
[95:10.67]Wow, the butthole technique is gonna work.
[95:14.46]I can't believe my butthole technique is going to work!
[95:19.50]This is working!
[95:20.10]I can't believe it!
[95:22.78]Oh god!
[95:25.78]Give me the kill!
[95:26.86]Yes!
[95:30.04]Yeah!

[96:14.64]deleted on stream that was fun for somebody not knowing um how to drink an Estus this is a Dark Souls video that is an edited this is an edited video by the way
[96:38.30]Of somebody that does not understand until the end of the video.
[96:41.54]And they still don't know how to do it by the end.
[96:43.92]How to drink the healing mechanic.
[96:49.64]But come on.

[97:05.31]I'm not going to delete it.
[97:06.07]I'm not going to delete it.
[97:06.83]I'm not going to delete it.
[97:14.39]I only delete videos that I accidentally delete and try to clean my channel up and delete like a hundred videos.
[97:25.54]I told you that story about that time in history when I was like, how many videos do I have?
[97:32.80]I have too many videos that just like suck or fucked up or like they don't, no, no.
[97:37.49]I have like streams.
[97:39.37]I remember I used to stream on YouTube and these whole
[97:45.01]like trial run three to two to three hour youtube streams would just get dumped into the sub box and I was like I don't want these on the channel I don't want these just like sitting here so I I deleted them watch the pac-man video didn't we didn't we watch the pac-man video
[98:16.64]We didn't watch the Pac-Man video where I'm like at the... sliding down the slide and shit.
[98:29.23]Somebody just gave a hundred bucks.
[98:39.11]Hold on, let me see here.
[98:41.21]Who just gave a hundred dollars?
[98:44.40]That was Die335.
[98:46.24]Thanks for the hundred bucks, Die.
[98:48.82]One hundred.
[98:50.45]And they say, just want to thank you for spending so much time with your fellow rats.
[98:53.87]Been watching since these videos were first made.
[98:58.55]Been around a long time.
[98:59.85]You and your videos have helped me through some many tough times.
[99:01.63]Thanks a million.
[99:02.27]P.S.
[99:02.55]Don't delete it.
[99:03.48]This is part of your origin story.
[99:06.42]I'm not going to delete it.
[99:07.22]I'm just kidding around.
[99:11.71]Thank you, though.
[99:12.33]That's an incredibly nice thing to say.
[99:18.36]Thank you, Dai, for the 100 fucking dollars.
[99:21.29]And your really, really nice message.
[99:22.45]That's just a really nice thing to say.
[99:26.84]Alright, what's next?
[99:28.16]Uh... Why is the Kingpin video gone?
[99:31.22]A bunch of videos are gone because I... YouTube used to have a feature where you could just click a box and then, like, just delete videos.
[99:38.11]I could just, like, check, check, check, and... I don't know.
[99:40.67]I thought... I thought there was, like, something in it or something wrong with it.
[99:43.63]I don't know.
[99:45.77]I went through and deleted, like, 80 videos, like, in 2015 or something.
[99:49.76]2014.
[99:52.34]Did we watch the Firewatch video?
[99:53.86]Is this a streamer's choice?
[99:56.28]We didn't watch the Firewatch video.
[100:06.36]No, we haven't seen it.
[100:08.73]Alright, let's watch this one.
[100:15.97]This is another one of my... Probably one of my favorite videos.
[100:18.79]This is another one of the last videos I made, too.
[100:26.07]another butthole technique video technically yes but physically no you know what I'm saying alright this is called the photos are in this is like yeah one of the last like four or five videos I made I like this one a lot too let's go ahead and see what happens
[100:51.26]So I just recently beat Firewatch and I came across a feature that I haven't really seen very many people talk about.
[100:57.66]There's a disposable camera in this game that allows you to take pictures.
[101:01.36]You can take a picture of whatever you want.
[101:03.49]It never leaves your inventory and you have it throughout the whole game.
[101:07.31]But the cool feature is they actually ask you if you want to develop those photos and they will mail them to you.
[101:14.60]And that's exactly what I did.
[101:16.22]They got here today, and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys.
[101:19.14]Like, I thought it'd be a really neat idea to look at them together and see what I took pictures of.
[101:23.18]Now, it has been a while, so I don't actually know or remember what's on these.
[101:31.08]Hey, your memories have arrived, huh?
[101:32.80]Oh, that's real cute.
[101:33.68]Photo dome.
[101:34.96]Look at that.
[101:36.92]Okay, let's open them up.
[101:37.69]Let's see what we got.
[101:44.45]The first one is the sky.
[101:45.55]The sky can be cool sometimes, I guess.
[101:51.84]That's a rock.
[101:53.64]A pretty interesting growth of a rock.
[101:55.52]The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool.
[102:00.16]I think that's the inside of a bush.
[102:02.69]Yeah, that's the inside of a bush.
[102:10.67]I think I was trying to take a picture of
[102:17.11]These are fucking terrible.
[102:20.15]Seriously.
[102:22.57]Did I take these?
[102:24.07]Somebody had to develop these at Firewatch.
[102:26.75]At that company.
[102:27.91]Is that a thumbprint?
[102:31.03]Oh, here we go.
[102:31.57]There's a little selfie there.
[102:32.93]You know, selfie action.
[102:34.16]Sometimes you gotta take one.
[102:36.46]Okay.
[102:41.06]That's a private one.
[102:43.82]That's gonna go in a different pile.
[102:46.38]It's going to go in the privacy pile.
[102:49.17]Hey, a fence.
[102:49.75]Take a look at that.
[102:50.37]Interesting, right?
[102:53.95]What am I even taking a picture of?
[102:55.51]That is actually censored.
[102:58.06]Hey, there you go.
[102:59.30]Got a picture of the toilet, you know?
[103:01.98]Oh, this one's great.
[103:02.58]I like this one.
[103:03.02]This one's like, there was a rock on a stump, and I thought, well, that's such an interesting rock.
[103:07.14]That's so odd.
[103:08.45]Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?
[103:18.13]Uh, I don't know why there is a box up there, I guess.
[103:23.04]Oh, here we go.
[103:23.46]Here we go.
[103:23.74]I remember this tree.
[103:25.04]I remember saying to myself, man, it's got such interesting moss growing on the side.
[103:28.62]I got to get a picture with it.
[103:29.58]So there you go.
[103:30.48]There it is.
[103:36.80]Privacy pile.
[103:38.18]Do I still have the pictures?
[103:39.24]Damn it.
[103:39.58]No, I don't.
[103:49.16]Who am I?
[103:57.65]I don't know who the fuck this is.
[104:00.09]I have no idea.
[104:01.17]I've never met this person before in my entire life.
[104:06.17]No, I wasn't actually- Another rock.
[104:08.93]Good one.
[104:11.04]Oh look, another rock!
[104:11.90]Oh cool, there's a sunset you could've taken a picture of too.
[104:14.46]Oh, good rock in the way!
[104:17.18]Come on.
[104:18.57]Come on!
[104:19.17]You know what?
[104:20.39]I apologize for this.
[104:25.49]Oh my god!
[104:26.19]That's somebody's asshole.
[104:34.63]I hope it's not mine.
[104:37.27]Nah, it's mine.
[104:38.37]It's mine.
[104:38.93]Do something cool.
[104:40.17]So interesting.
[104:40.77]Get him developed.
[104:42.31]Look at this.
[104:43.09]I did something cool, guys.
[104:55.97]Hey, Ma.
[104:57.57]Don't look in the trash.
[105:01.96]Yeah.
[105:03.58]Somebody at... What's the name of... What's the name of the studio that made that game?
[105:13.10]Somebody had to develop those shit photos and go, they probably thought it was like a little kid or something.
[105:18.53]You know what I mean?
[105:20.07]Like every photo was of a rock or like of the ceiling and that cost money to do that.
[105:26.28]That wasn't free.
[105:28.30]Somebody had to develop all those shitty photos in the game and send them to me.
[105:35.83]That's the funniest part of this video to me, is that somebody was like putting that package together and going, holy shit, like why did you pay for this?
[105:50.44]The studio that made Firewatch is now part of Valve, that's true.
[105:57.12]Something that I've noticed over the last like hour and 20 minutes of this stream,
[106:01.88]um I have been putting this up to my mouth to drink this coffee for about an hour and there's nothing in it there hasn't been anything in this in over an hour I I'm gonna go refill this uh but who who is that guy I have no idea I don't have any idea
[106:31.84]Why am I drinking from Kim's cup?
[106:33.70]Because.
[106:38.25]Tell us, tell us.
[106:39.35]Do you want everything spoiled?
[106:48.27]Yes, yes.
[106:49.59]This is Kim's cup.
[106:50.72]There's your spoiler.
[106:53.20]That wasn't Burger Boy.
[106:56.80]No, some things don't have to be described.
[107:01.84]You know, for Twitch terms of service purposes.
[107:06.12]That was all fake.
[107:09.48]So just kind of hitting that realization right now.
[107:17.22]Right.
[107:19.14]Anyways, I'm going to go get some coffee.
[107:23.06]I will be right back.
[107:25.59]We'll continue to do this for like another hour or so.
[107:29.43]Let's get the BRB on the screen.
[107:31.25]I'll be right back.
[110:44.01]Yo.
[110:47.87]I'm back.
[110:53.53]Watch Rat Movie 1 and 2.
[110:55.36]We did that last time, I think.
[111:04.68]The Secret Pancake Recipe?
[111:07.16]Yeah.
[111:07.36]Yeah, we'll do that one.
[111:15.39]Isn't this a video where I just, like, when I'm shooting at people through the sniper, I just say that they're part of, like, a pancake or something?
[111:25.34]That's the whole video, right?
[111:29.84]That's the entire video.
[111:32.50]Let's see.
[111:33.00]Let's see if it holds up.
[111:41.33]This is the, uh, wrist recoil.
[111:49.23]Somebody said, this is one of my worst videos.
[111:53.64]We'll see.
[111:57.96]It's a terrible recipe, too.
[111:59.35]Is it?
[112:01.73]It really is.
[112:02.93]This seems to be pretty polarized right now.
[112:05.21]This is one of my worst.
[112:06.99]Look at this hair.
[112:07.66]Come on, man.
[112:09.26]I need to get this part just cut.
[112:11.64]It looks so much better.
[112:12.88]I need a haircut.
[112:13.46]That's what I need.
[112:15.88]Yeah, people saying this sucks.
[112:17.62]This is great.
[112:18.76]We got 50%, 50% here.
[112:19.44]Let's see.
[112:19.87]I have not seen this video since I probably uploaded it.
[112:30.48]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[112:31.84]Jerma here with recoil.
[112:34.16]I just was spectating.
[112:35.16]I was trying to spectate a guy that knew what he was doing.
[112:37.24]Looks like Artman's going to go in.
[112:38.30]We're going to see here.
[112:39.18]Going for the double shotgun shot.
[112:40.26]Gets the shot.
[112:40.84]Gets two shots on him.
[112:42.42]Right there, we got Artman going in for the kill.
[112:44.12]We're going to see on the top left staircase.
[112:45.46]Gets the pistol out.
[112:46.18]Is he going to get it in time?
[112:47.53]He's dancing around, going for the knife kills.
[112:49.59]Is he going to get it in?
[112:54.47]What the fuck?
[112:54.89]What was that?
[112:56.01]No, that was so unexpected.
[112:58.31]What?
[112:59.68]So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Shizzy Boy.
[113:03.24]I guess now it's time to do a player profile on Clidio.
[113:06.20]Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch, guys.
[113:08.60]He has a lot of things in his arsenal.
[113:10.14]He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world.
[113:13.33]And he also plays the piano.
[113:14.45]So a good little bit of tidbit of information on the player.
[113:16.89]That I like to see it.
[113:18.05]Now I'm going to do a player profile on V2FXXX.
[113:21.51]He is one of the best SMG players in the world.
[113:24.07]As you can probably imagine, having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need.
[113:29.95]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Cat.
[113:31.56]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Shizzy Boy.
[113:34.04]Shizzy Boy is another one of those characters you'll love to see.
[113:36.34]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Zeyoshio.
[113:39.60]Holy shit, this is melting my brain.
[113:43.00]Just like that, we get a two-piece.
[113:45.01]Just like... Let's see how good this video... Oh.
[113:51.49]Yeah, stuff him.
[113:52.43]Stuff him.
[113:53.67]Me and my teammates.
[113:54.95]Me and my teammates recoiling all over the place.
[113:57.68]Look at that.
[113:59.70]I'll teach you how to recoil, guys.
[114:00.94]What you want to do first, you want to turn a corner with a fucking grenade in your hand.
[114:04.26]Easy with that.
[114:04.82]And you just want to... Easy.
[114:06.02]...throw it into their spawn.
[114:07.52]I don't even know if that's their spawn.
[114:09.15]I got a couple hits.
[114:10.57]Tango down.
[114:11.75]Charlie down.
[114:12.99]And... Guy in a window.
[114:15.99]Down?
[114:17.37]What?
[114:17.59]He's in the... What the... He's in this video?
[114:19.21]I gotta get...
[114:20.87]I gotta string something.
[114:21.85]What the hell is that guy?
[114:22.41]That's the first thing he said.
[114:23.93]What the hell?
[114:24.47]This guy got, like, face paint on?
[114:26.41]That's the first thing he said the whole time.
[114:27.85]I wanna, like, see his broken ass neck.
[114:30.37]Yeah, he's got, like, face paint on.
[114:31.51]This guy looks like a WWF wrestler.
[114:35.49]I wanna be, like, a WCW NWO wrestler.
[114:41.44]There it is.
[114:41.92]Killing machine.
[114:43.46]Oh!
[114:45.14]That's two!
[114:45.48]Fucking WCW guy killed me.
[114:55.33]What the fuck happened to you?
[115:00.34]I definitely want to be a WCW.
[115:01.28]Okay, we got this WCW guy.
[115:04.56]This guy is just kind of crazy looking.
[115:06.36]He's kind of creepy.
[115:07.04]And then we got Tattoo Guy.
[115:08.50]Why is... Why is Tattoo Guy the guy with the face paint?
[115:13.72]This should be Tattoo Guy.
[115:17.97]Something I've noticed in every video game that has this gun.
[115:22.03]The Drognov always sucks.
[115:24.05]It does.
[115:24.31]It does.
[115:25.98]Has there ever been a game made where the draugnov, like, wasn't a fucking piece of shit?
[115:32.53]Has that ever happened?
[115:33.77]I just got three kills with it in a row, so let's just pretend like I didn't say that.
[115:42.61]It's good in COD 4.
[115:44.23]Ooh.
[115:45.98]Ooh!
[115:49.08]Somebody's... Somebody learned how to play!
[115:52.54]Somebody!
[115:57.70]Why?
[116:00.10]Be a part of wall!
[116:01.18]I'm gonna teach you guys how to make pancakes, alright?
[116:06.13]It's gonna be pretty easy.
[116:07.79]There's the first ingredient, that's two eggs.
[116:09.55]Around this corner we got some butter.
[116:13.83]And then, of course, you cannot forget... Fucking God!
[116:18.47]This is the secret recipe for pancakes.
[116:20.80]Two eggs.
[116:23.28]Then you gotta also put in the butter.
[116:25.67]But I can't find the butter.
[116:26.76]The butter ran down here.
[116:28.52]There's the butter.
[116:30.22]I missed the bowl with the butter.
[116:31.96]Fucking goddammit.
[116:33.68]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[116:34.88]Jerma here.
[116:35.36]Welcome to Cooking with Jerma.
[116:37.44]This is a new series I'm doing where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast.
[116:42.51]And what you want is you want a bowl.
[116:43.75]Bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in, obviously, because we're gonna give you my secret recipe for pancakes.
[116:48.85]So what you want to do is, of course, you want to put in, you know, where we got here, two eggs.
[116:54.45]Little bit of butter.
[116:55.49]Hold on.
[116:55.95]The butter ran away.
[116:56.63]Hold on.
[116:57.17]So confident.
[116:58.37]The butter fell on the floor.
[117:00.09]I gotta pick up the butter.
[117:01.41]There's the butter.
[117:01.95]There's the butter.
[117:05.25]Butter's in the bowl now.
[117:06.17]Then, of course, you gotta add the flour.
[117:08.25]Flour is shooting at me.
[117:10.57]Flour's shooting at me.
[117:11.72]It's okay.
[117:12.16]It's okay.
[117:14.96]Flour killed me.
[117:17.18]Welcome to Cooking with Tremor, guys.
[117:19.54]In this episode, I'm gonna teach you how to make pancakes.
[117:22.93]Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes, you got it all wrong.
[117:25.85]You see, first you gotta get a bowl.
[117:28.19]Then once you get that bowl, you throw in two eggs.
[117:31.47]Once the eggs are in there, you put in the flour.
[117:34.47]Once the flour's in there, you roll your sleeves up, get your hands a little bit dirty, and you add a little bit more butter.
[117:40.77]Fucking god damn it!
[117:44.45]Do you understand how hard you're trying to make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard?
[117:50.98]I'm getting behind them.
[117:51.84]I'm getting in their spawn.
[117:53.48]And it's gonna be a big fucking surprise when I get in there.
[117:58.17]We used to do this sometimes.
[117:59.48]Speaking of big su- Somebody would just be making a video, and the other person would just be, like, reacting to what the hell they were saying.
[118:06.28]What is this?
[118:08.22]What is this fucking Gumby?
[118:12.40]What is this?
[118:13.24]What is that, like, fucking Stretch Armstrong in, like, a fucking taffy factory?
[118:20.38]And we're coming out of the wire here, guys.
[118:21.94]This is the final moment in the 2016 Recoil Tournament.
[118:26.21]Welcome.
[118:26.55]I'm very glad to do it with you.
[118:28.83]We're very glad to cast it with you.
[118:30.75]Very glad to do it with you.
[118:35.46]V2 coming around with a shot rifle.
[118:36.88]Got a couple of shots on him.
[118:37.80]Shizzyboy is looking bad here.
[118:39.82]He's gonna jump on the top of it.
[118:40.82]He gets the kill with his super duper scoper boper.
[118:44.78]And he gets a good shot.
[118:46.76]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[118:47.88]And he turns around.
[118:49.12]We got the cash drag.
[118:49.88]We're getting wrapped around by two people.
[118:51.12]And oh my god!
[118:52.02]Did you see that fucking backflip?
[118:59.69]Super duper scoper doper.
[119:08.39]Ow, my fucking teeth.
[119:11.43]Do you ever do that?
[119:12.17]I hate that.
[119:13.79]Sometimes I wish I could just like... You know my airplane, how an airplane pulls its wheels up before it lands?
[119:19.09]I'd love if I could just like... Pull up all my front teeth.
[119:22.86]Like before I take a sip.
[119:25.16]I hit my teeth all the fucking time.
[119:27.50]I got these big ass teeth.
[119:29.88]I really just want to like have them retract up into my mouth.
[119:37.49]Time Gun?
[119:38.17]We watched Time Gun last time.
[119:45.37]Let's see, what else?
[119:46.61]Impossible Creatures.
[119:48.63]Somebody was asking for that earlier.
[119:57.58]Oh shit, I do remember this.
[119:59.64]I remember this video.
[120:02.94]This game is so strange.
[120:08.58]I feel like I'd want to play this game again.
[120:11.92]It was a weird one.
[120:16.41]Possible creatures.
[120:24.17]I don't know.
[120:24.59]I don't know if I like that.
[120:27.66]Star also in this video.
[120:28.92]You didn't know?
[120:29.92]No, there's something wrong here.
[120:32.00]There's something wrong.
[120:33.84]It's the elephant.
[120:34.44]I know elephant.
[120:35.44]It's got to be something else.
[120:37.11]Giraffe.
[120:38.55]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[120:40.33]That is the perfect animal.
[120:42.99]This game is fucking so stupid.
[120:47.13]Hey, what are you doing over here?
[120:48.39]Click on him and look at his name.
[120:49.95]What is that?
[120:51.05]Look at its name.
[120:54.81]Jirima in real life?
[120:57.33]XD.
[120:59.18]What is that?
[120:59.82]Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?
[121:02.15]Yeah.
[121:03.03]No.
[121:03.61]Get out of here.
[121:04.37]This is our turf.
[121:05.63]This is a giraffe skunk turf.
[121:08.19]Get the fuck out of here.
[121:09.74]I don't think you could have hurt him.
[121:11.06]Can I not kill this?
[121:13.20]Get out of here.
[121:14.46]He's too awesome.
[121:15.82]Come help me, long guy.
[121:17.34]I need help from long guy.
[121:19.36]What do you mean long guy?
[121:24.85]Oh, you can do, like, dachshund, right?
[121:27.91]Is that a dachshund?
[121:30.15]Ready, boss.
[121:31.41]You're the boss.
[121:32.65]No building is a... Somebody's cheating.
[121:35.67]Building's done.
[121:36.57]I told you if somebody else was doing cheating.
[121:38.95]Thanks for the heads up.
[121:39.75]I don't... I don't... No, I don't... Stop.
[121:46.93]Just stay here.
[121:48.47]Just stay here.
[121:52.04]Can I do anything?
[121:53.30]Shark, can I do any funny moves?
[121:55.06]Where are my funny moves?
[121:59.02]One of these times you're gonna spawn there and it's gonna kill you.
[122:01.68]Got him.
[122:04.30]That's not fair!
[122:05.45]No, it's really not.
[122:09.45]And what the hell are you two doing?
[122:12.57]You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter.
[122:15.75]Kill him!
[122:16.98]No!
[122:18.14]Kill him!
[122:18.96]Kill the disappearing shark shithead.
[122:20.72]He's dead.
[122:21.54]No, you got him.
[122:22.76]I did not kill him.
[122:24.54]He is very much alive.
[122:27.41]He has like a teleporting laser ant shark.
[122:34.15]How am I supposed to win?
[122:36.57]I can't...
[122:39.43]Stop.
[122:40.33]Let them have a fight.
[122:42.27]You're not supposed to just let them die.
[122:44.69]That was all the fight I had.
[122:46.37]The critters are under attack.
[122:48.57]Come on.
[122:51.57]This game is so stupid.
[122:54.70]What is that thing?
[122:57.04]What the fuck?
[122:59.52]What?
[122:59.78]It's a cobra.
[123:01.58]You don't like... You don't appreciate the meta.
[123:06.44]What meta?
[123:07.52]Don't build it.
[123:08.56]The overlord scouting meta.
[123:11.69]I don't think I understand this joke.
[123:14.83]That's a whale bee.
[123:16.77]What is the overlord?
[123:18.15]No, he's like a zerg.
[123:20.39]You send your overlord out to scout first.
[123:22.55]I didn't play Starcraft.
[123:23.85]I don't play Starcraft.
[123:25.20]I have no idea.
[123:27.24]I have not played Starcraft enough to know what that is.
[123:30.50]I think everyone who has ever played a video game at the very least
[123:37.59]Knows what a fucking Zerg rush is.
[123:40.41]Yeah, well, that's not... Here comes my Zerglings.
[123:45.61]I wasn't even ready.
[123:49.67]Come on!
[123:53.54]It's like turtle dance.
[123:55.24]Alright, okay, alright.
[123:57.24]Your overarching theme, I get it.
[123:59.20]You're doing a StarCraft thing with your turtle bugs.
[124:02.38]That's really great.
[124:04.52]It is really great.
[124:07.82]Get the fuck out of here.
[124:09.10]Get this thing and get your Overlord and fucking stuff it up your ass.
[124:12.63]Whoa.
[124:12.81]He says he's coming for himself.
[124:14.73]We have plenty of units.
[124:16.85]We have the strangest animal the whole time.
[124:21.63]There's people.
[124:22.45]I love how my... They're not even attacking.
[124:25.77]Attack them.
[124:26.33]Kill them.
[124:27.59]Kill the people.
[124:29.11]Why did you... This is so shit.
[124:31.71]Get him.
[124:35.40]The critters are under attack!
[124:36.48]We're not gonna win!
[124:37.60]We're not gonna win!
[124:38.82]Steal their coal!
[124:40.00]Steal the coal!
[124:40.66]Get out of here!
[124:42.19]Get the coal!
[124:42.85]Come on snake!
[124:43.61]Spit it out!
[124:44.29]Spit it up snake!
[124:44.97]Use your snake spit!
[124:47.99]Start mining!
[124:48.77]Start mining!
[124:49.69]Everyone mine it!
[124:50.67]I would have figured these guys would be dead way long ago.
[124:53.08]They are getting eaten by giant crocodile bears.
[125:00.52]We're taking this into the base we are taking this shit into the base after you kill them Darren Go for it Darren
[125:21.04]The fights in this are so anticlimactic.
[125:23.72]Kill them all, Darren.
[125:25.86]That's right.
[125:26.42]Who is Darren?
[125:27.82]Very good, Darren.
[125:29.52]Very good job, Darren.
[125:31.28]Yeah, those things are called Darrens.
[125:33.28]You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darrens.
[125:35.76]I didn't think I could.
[125:36.60]Come on, Darren.
[125:39.60]You've got this, Darren.
[125:41.66]He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying magic.
[125:44.22]Does he know who you are?
[125:45.85]You're fucking Darren.
[125:46.61]Darren.
[125:55.08]For centuries, I don't know how to start this What are we fighting for I would like to speak with your leader yes The other leader other one we have plenty of leaders oh
[126:13.12]When one goes down, the other will take its place.
[126:16.34]I need at least one.
[126:17.52]There's another one right here.
[126:18.71]There's another leader.
[126:19.73]Would you like to see a new one?
[126:22.05]This is also a leader.
[126:24.91]Yeah, see, one of your guys we caught the other day, he was on our sand.
[126:29.95]Play this again.
[126:30.99]And we agreed that was ours.
[126:31.89]I don't believe that.
[126:32.77]We had a treaty 2,000 years ago, your people and our people, that this bridge shall never be crossed unless for diplomatic reasons.
[126:41.38]We're crossing it right now.
[126:42.64]We caught one of your... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[126:45.32]What are you going to do about it?
[126:46.96]What are you going to do about it?
[126:48.06]That's an act of war.
[126:49.36]You back up or that is an act of war.
[126:51.42]It's an act of war.
[126:54.08]What?
[126:55.24]Wait, they're not... Holy shit.
[127:00.18]Oh my god.
[127:04.86]Holy shit.
[127:07.50]I forgot about that.
[127:08.68]What did you say?
[127:09.48]Nuclear transform?
[127:11.01]I don't know.
[127:14.41]Nuclear?
[127:15.71]I said not nuclear this time, right?
[127:21.53]Do the Pac-Man first person maze video.
[127:25.15]No, it's not.
[127:30.38]Co-op crusade?
[127:31.46]That's a good one.
[127:43.69]Yeah, that's a, that's a good one.
[127:47.53]This is another, uh, little bit of insight here.
[127:49.25]This is another one of those videos that halfway through making it, I said, this is, this video's bad.
[127:54.55]But then, I powered through it, and it turned out it was, like, one of my favorite, like, just stupid, shitty, fucking co-op videos.
[128:05.82]It got to that point, like, I was, like, in the editing zone.
[128:08.96]And I was at, like, minute number, like, four or three or something, just going...
[128:14.79]No, no, I'm going to, I'm going to have to can this.
[128:17.09]I've canned videos before.
[128:18.29]This is what people I don't think understand is I wish I could go back in time and just tell myself, look, don't upload it.
[128:27.76]You don't have to upload it, but just put it in this folder.
[128:30.68]Just put it in that folder right there and just hold on to it.
[128:33.74]Put it on the thumb drive and just forget about it.
[128:35.60]Because this is like at least 10 or 20 videos that I made that I didn't like and wasn't happy with that 2018, 2019 me would love to show you.
[128:47.39]Unfortunately.
[128:48.27]But that's not the case.
[128:54.25]It's too bad.
[128:58.25]Too bad.
[128:59.89]But that's just the way it is.
[129:03.67]If he was in the editing zone...
[129:08.95]This is so loud and annoying.
[129:12.05]Fucking Gerald.
[129:13.21]This is a long opening cutscene.
[129:14.51]It was very long.
[129:16.09]And what if it turns out me and you are these two guys?
[129:30.14]It won't be long before Overrun.
[129:31.84]Alright, can we play?
[129:32.72]I want like 30 more.
[129:33.69]Oh, God.
[129:34.01]Wait, is this us?
[129:34.45]I think that this is supposed to be both of us.
[129:42.85]Alright, let's fucking play this dumb game.
[129:45.71]I take us now to where our story begins.
[129:47.97]What?
[129:48.98]Thousands of miles away.
[129:50.16]Our story didn't just begin.
[129:51.10]In the kingdom of France.
[129:52.46]My family.
[129:53.06]February evening in the year 1199.
[129:54.58]My quest remains unfinished.
[129:57.65]As for Dennis, his is about to begin.
[130:00.85]but as fate would have it there is another hero who would be impossible to forget there's too many people in this game mostly dependable men they're freezed with pretty tunics
[130:16.20]I bet he wields that sword no better than a farmer!
[130:18.87]This new character.
[130:20.17]Wait, we get to play!
[130:20.99]We get to play!
[130:21.85]This game is so good.
[130:25.19]I was gonna get my ass kicked!
[130:27.02]Didn't even tell us how to play the game!
[130:31.06]Denz is a talented swordsman who has never let fear get him in a fight.
[130:41.62]I wasn't this good.
[130:43.19]No.
[130:43.65]I was not doing this good.
[130:45.81]What?
[130:46.75]Is that you?
[130:47.65]I don't know.
[130:48.07]Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here?
[130:50.87]Alright.
[130:52.91]Different universes.
[130:54.46]Where am I?
[130:54.90]What is happening?
[130:56.04]I died.
[130:57.22]He's going to kill me.
[131:07.71]No!
[131:08.17]No, I'm skipping!
[131:11.09]Get us out of here!
[131:12.43]Hold on, I've hit space, you have to hit skip.
[131:14.77]Okay, you have to do the on-screen prompts.
[131:21.91]Alright, but hold on, hold on.
[131:23.63]Wait a second.
[131:24.52]Here's the thing about this video, and about this game.
[131:27.22]What the fuck are you doing?
[131:28.28]What's going on right now?
[131:29.38]Hold on, I've hit space, you have to hit skip.
[131:31.80]I still, this many years later, have no idea what's going on here.
[131:35.23]Well, there's a prompt on the screen, but you can also move your character.
[131:40.54]So... I'm on the top, right?
[131:44.88]See, the prompt on the screen is down.
[131:48.20]Down.
[131:48.56]Press down, right?
[131:49.66]So, I'll press down.
[131:50.78]Okay, you have to do the on-screen prompts.
[131:54.79]I did what it told me to do.
[131:57.07]I pressed the down key.
[132:03.66]Dens is a talented swordsman.
[132:05.50]Dens is a talented swordsman who has never let... Direct D, perform a normal attack, C, counter, co-op, star.
[132:15.55]Why does it say that?
[132:17.25]Why is it D, C, why wouldn't it be like A, B, C?
[132:20.33]D, C, star.
[132:20.95]Why is it star?
[132:21.61]Yeah, because you're playing co-op.
[132:22.88]I'm playing co-op with you.
[132:24.16]Yeah.
[132:24.30]A lot of weird shit going on.
[132:26.62]That's performed when I grab an enemy.
[132:28.54]Okay, well... Gee, that's HML.
[132:31.58]The low isn't star.
[132:32.96]Yeah.
[132:37.65]It's another character.
[132:40.65]He missed every arrow.
[132:42.17]Did you see how many arrows he just shot?
[132:43.63]He missed every one.
[132:45.05]They didn't even get close.
[132:46.11]They didn't even get close.
[132:46.75]They were all in unison.
[132:47.59]They landed right in front of these guys.
[132:49.27]Time to earn your pay, dogs.
[132:53.42]They just missed him.
[132:56.44]They really are just firing like 10 feet in front of him.
[133:01.30]Come on, you gotta do some more work.
[133:02.52]I'm doing all the work here on the left.
[133:04.79]Are you dead?
[133:06.96]Take cover!
[133:10.44]Now's our chance.
[133:11.16]Let's go.
[133:12.74]He ran in the mouth.
[133:13.94]He ran in the face.
[133:19.12]Now's our chance.
[133:21.25]Now's our chance.
[133:22.33]Let's go.
[133:23.39]I got hit right in the mouth.
[133:28.53]It went clearly all the way over my head.
[133:30.87]Did you?
[133:32.21]I got hit right in the face.
[133:34.13]And he just put his hand up and wiped his face.
[133:38.58]This game is a treasure.
[133:39.40]Do you feel like we're these guys on the right?
[133:41.36]Which characters are we right now?
[133:43.64]All of your audio is on the left.
[133:46.10]Mine's all on the right or something.
[133:49.14]I just ran away.
[133:50.14]I just got... He just, like, took off.
[133:56.97]Oh, shit.
[133:57.43]This guy died.
[133:58.65]I'm out of here.
[134:00.55]Listen to this shit.
[134:01.53]Right now.
[134:02.89]All of your audio is, like, on the left.
[134:05.45]Mine's all on the right or something.
[134:08.41]I just ran away.
[134:09.43]I just got... I fucking love this game.
[134:13.70]He just, like, took
[134:16.24]Oh shit, this guy died!
[134:17.40]I'm outta here!
[134:20.28]Those guys on the left are dead.
[134:24.54]That guy got shot with a machine gun.
[134:28.46]So I can... you step out and... It's inverted.
[134:35.18]It's inverted!
[134:36.36]Mine's inverted!
[134:40.50]Shoot him!
[134:40.78]Just standing here.
[134:46.82]I don't even know what the fuck.
[134:48.36]That was a bad guy.
[134:49.36]That was a bad guy.
[134:50.30]That was a bad guy.
[134:51.86]Oh yeah, we didn't know if they were NPCs on our side or not.
[134:55.29]Look at this fucking co-op.
[134:56.43]It could probably fit us both on the same screen.
[134:58.69]I know, really.
[135:00.65]It could probably just be one screen.
[135:02.27]We probably could be on one screen right now.
[135:06.13]Is that an enemy?
[135:11.36]This is really gonna be a headache.
[135:14.88]No, this is where we came from.
[135:16.12]Oh, shit.
[135:16.84]We're going the wrong way.
[135:18.16]They have two screens.
[135:21.16]Your turn now.
[135:22.84]I said co-op.
[135:23.99]Is this a boss?
[135:25.19]I guess.
[135:25.81]Alright, first boss fight.
[135:27.91]You ready?
[135:29.87]What's the strategy?
[135:31.25]Oh, get hit.
[135:33.13]Alright, just co-op him.
[135:34.25]You ready?
[135:34.47]Yeah, just co-op him.
[135:35.51]Co-op him.
[135:41.16]Right in the fire.
[135:46.19]Oh, they got me.
[135:48.15]Good God, we co-opted.
[135:48.99]You know how to wield a blade.
[135:50.11]Yeah, you guys know how to do that.
[135:51.03]Let's see if you can wield fire half as well.
[135:54.17]Oh, shit, he's a demon.
[135:56.16]Hey, you ready to co-opt this guy?
[135:58.64]Yeah.
[136:12.69]That shit probably went down in real life, though.
[136:15.92]What a fucking useless enemy.
[136:19.04]Dude, in real life, if there's two or three people swinging at you at the same time, you're going to get fucking pelted over and over again.
[136:23.76]Pope Innocent himself has come to preach the Crusades want of Abel.
[136:27.80]Garen fucking T, that guy's a demon.
[136:31.84]You don't have a name like Pope Innocent III if you're not the bad guy of the whole game.
[136:37.62]It's funny because this is all historically accurate, and it's probably a real guy.
[136:40.50]Yeah, that is a real person.
[136:42.88]The Bane is the typical bored king.
[136:46.28]Eventually, I hope somebody makes me come from my sleep and see these two gentlemen.
[136:50.88]Oh, look, do you see how good they did?
[136:52.18]I'll speak to them now.
[137:03.81]You!
[137:05.21]You won't defeat me!
[137:09.77]Uh oh.
[137:22.26]Rain is back.
[137:24.12]I hope he doesn't do a brutality.
[137:30.50]This game was not made for two people to play at the same time.
[137:37.30]He's dead.
[137:37.78]No, we have to do the sacred flames.
[137:44.48]No, he's dead.
[137:46.14]He's gone.
[137:46.50]We won.
[137:46.76]What?
[137:46.88]There was a whole plan.
[137:48.20]We couldn't even hear the whole plan.
[137:49.28]We co-opted him too fast.
[137:50.02]We couldn't even hear the plan.
[138:03.61]This is on normal.
[138:04.27]This is on, like, easy.
[138:05.53]The way they were talking, that wasn't even supposed to happen.
[138:07.77]It was like, you create a diversion and, like, we'll do a purifying flame.
[138:10.49]No.
[138:11.19]No, he's just dead.
[138:12.20]I pressed X. Some of these old videos.
[138:22.92]Some of these old videos when me and Star used to play some of these games.
[138:28.05]God, I just don't remember everything that I... All my emotions are coming back to me.
[138:35.67]Some of these games are fucking so hilarious.
[138:39.73]This is a good one, too.
[138:40.85]Hacker and Slacker, that's a good one.
[138:45.20]Ravenscry, we watched Ravenscry last time.
[138:48.42]We did that before.
[139:00.36]Yeah, I think we did both Ravenscrys last time.
[139:07.00]We did tactical intervention last time.
[139:08.44]Let's do hacker in the slacker.
[139:15.55]This is a long video.
[139:16.81]This is a 10 minute video.
[139:20.61]This is a long one.
[139:21.35]Alright, let's get this on here.
[139:40.41]hacker and the slacker do diablo 3. I made like a I streamed it and played it a bunch replay all of my blazing bullets I need to wait for you to disable that camcorder
[140:07.02]Take out that camcorder.
[140:08.80]Hold on.
[140:10.32]Figure it out.
[140:10.92]There's a lot more to hacking than there is walking down an alley and getting caught.
[140:16.83]My screen is four different windows of views and each one has a tutorial on it right now.

[140:24.01]Martin can lure enemies away from their post by calling a throne pager.
[140:27.39]A throne pager.
[140:30.41]So apparently I can throw this pager and this guy's gonna go get it.
[140:36.96]Can you make that thing buzz?
[140:39.33]This game is actually really fucking cool.
[140:41.11]Oh, shit.

[140:51.13]Is he still turning?
[140:53.44]We're good.

[150:37.11]I can't... Does this video exist?
[150:42.30]Oh, it's unlisted.
[150:48.94]Why did he unlist it?
[150:52.92]Was he embarrassed over this video?
[151:05.13]He's embarrassed of me.
[151:07.07]What did I do in this video?

[152:34.01]I'm assuming you're happy you made a fucking witch doctor.
[152:38.07]No.
[152:39.19]I am not playing Diablo.
[152:40.67]Oh yeah, you're playing- you're playing annoy-Jerma.
[152:43.64]It's your favorite pastime.
[152:44.98]I can't believe you're still going with this.
[152:53.20]No mana.
[152:53.98]I'm not here.
[153:04.90]Oh, legendary on the ground.
[153:06.45]Got a legendary.
[153:07.15]Thanks, Jerma.
[153:08.35]Did you seriously?
[153:12.14]You won't drop that again.
[153:13.76]You won't drop that again.
[153:14.54]Fuck you.
[153:21.46]Dude, you're gonna fucking shit your pants when you see this one.
[153:25.41]The stolen ring!
[153:26.41]The stolen ring!
[153:28.65]Wonder why you had it.
[153:31.09]Oh my god, does this have vitality and intelligence on it?
[153:35.39]What a unique item.
[153:37.03]Fucking Diablo 3, man.
[153:38.37]This game is so bad.
[153:41.37]Melee!
[153:42.75]Wanna come play Diablo?
[153:45.01]Wanna come play CS?
[153:47.09]I'm gonna solo a game right now.
[153:50.65]And then after that, maybe you can play him, it's sharp.
[153:52.69]I'm in the middle of something important.
[153:54.93]No, he's not in the middle of something important.
[153:57.69]No, this is important for me.
[154:00.07]Come here!
[154:02.47]Come on.
[154:02.79]I'm gonna get you.
[154:03.33]I am gonna get you, I'm a fucking wizard for Christ- Wait, whoa!
[154:16.45]Yeah, you think that's gonna keep you safe, you fucking piece of shit?
[154:18.69]Oh, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle!
[154:20.00]A scary monster!
[154:23.00]What the fu- this is so weird.
[154:25.00]Okay I'm fucking done... with that. I'm so done with that.
[154:32.00]This isn't fun? This isn't the most fun you've had in Diablo 3?
[154:36.00]I'm done with that, I'm done like with that.
[154:37.00]Jerma, you're in the Halls of Agony.
[154:40.18]You know what happens in the Halls of Agony?
[154:43.96]It's not my video, I can't do this.
[154:48.60]Alright, Mela.
[154:51.25]I'm gonna have to ask you to stop for three seconds, sir.
[154:54.53]Mela, you need to be- Mela, you need to do, like, just a general assessment.
[155:00.89]He's following me around.
[155:03.27]As a witch doctor.
[155:04.65]Completely nude.
[155:06.15]Doing this I throw up on you animation with the thing that comes down and pukes.
[155:11.05]And he's making this a video.
[155:14.57]Do you like this video so far?
[155:16.26]I think it's pretty dumb.
[155:18.90]It's so dumb that I'm going to have to mute in mobile so I can play CO.
[155:26.85]You see, you just, like, really pissed off Bela.
[155:30.32]I'm not, you know, it's great.
[155:31.58]This actually is a good thing, because you can't revive here.
[155:34.34]I can stay alive.
[155:36.16]No, you can't.
[155:38.09]Here, I'm gonna help.
[155:39.07]I bet you 50 bucks you don't stay alive right now.
[155:41.03]You die in less than five seconds.
[155:43.55]Let's count to five, and if you stay, if you're alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[155:46.71]You're not counting!
[155:47.75]Count, count, count!
[155:48.84]One, two...
[155:53.06]I need to know where the guy is!
[155:54.34]I'M ALIVE!
[155:55.12]I'M STILL ALIVE!
[155:56.32]HE'S FUCKING HEAVEN!
[155:57.34]ALRIGHT, I GOT HIM!
[155:59.96]GOT HIM, DEFINITELY, YOU GUYS ARE- This wasn't even on- This is not even on me.
[156:05.92]I tried.
[156:06.45]I tried.
[156:07.51]Can I get a revive over here, though?
[156:10.73]No.
[156:10.93]Can I get a revive?
[156:11.83]No, just- Dude, I've never heard him scream like that before.
[156:19.11]Can I get a revive, though?
[156:21.43]One dollar.
[156:21.77]Alright, since you passed the test.
[156:22.74]Listen, I said one dollar.
[156:23.38]I'm alive!
[156:24.20]Fuck off!
[156:24.48]Count!
[156:24.92]Count to five, and if you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:28.68]You're not counting!
[156:29.48]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:31.86]You're not counting!
[156:32.32]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:34.24]You're not counting!
[156:34.66]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:36.48]You're not counting!
[156:36.96]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:38.44]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:39.78]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:42.26]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:43.86]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:45.88]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe you a dollar.
[156:47.28]If you stay here alive in five seconds, then I owe
[156:52.73]Ugh.
[156:53.81]Can I get a revive over here, though?
[156:55.33]I'm, like, remembering.
[156:55.85]I'm, like, seeing through my own eyes.
[156:57.47]Can I get a revive?
[156:58.29]No, just... I feel myself playing the game.
[157:01.27]Ugh.
[157:01.51]Dude, I've never heard him scream like that before.
[157:05.84]Can I get a revive, though?
[157:06.88]Alright, since you passed the test, you get to get revived.
[157:11.08]Thanks.
[157:11.48]You did pass the test.
[157:12.64]Okay.
[157:18.24]Oh, man.
[157:19.60]Oh, you did.
[157:20.04]What?! !
[157:22.67]It's another snake.
[157:23.63]Look at this snake.
[157:26.17]I am John Adventurer, man.
[157:28.25]Look at this snake.
[157:29.01]Look at this snake.
[157:30.26]Aww.
[157:32.94]I need to revive.
[157:38.30]You keep enabling me.
[157:39.87]So glad I have, like, Anchor Star.
[157:43.98]It's just driving around a ship with the fucking anchor down.
[157:47.08]I've stuck to this for a while.
[157:49.02]Yeah, you really have.
[157:50.41]You've just been being like a pain in the ass for the last like hour and 14 minutes.
[157:55.31]Does he have anything else to do?
[157:56.85]Apparently not.
[158:00.78]I don't know.
[158:02.00]Anyway, before you go down into the cellar.
[158:05.89]I was supposed to leave and make this game different before, like, an hour ago.
[158:09.81]Have you considered not going into the cellar?
[158:12.05]Because if you go into the cellar, all of these guys are going to turn into snakes.
[158:17.10]If you don't go into the cellar, they won't ever, ever turn into snakes.
[158:20.84]He deleted it?
[158:22.88]He, wait, hold on a second.
[158:24.16]He, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[158:26.20]This video doesn't exist?
[158:28.07]He deleted the video.
[158:29.15]The video's gone.
[158:31.37]No, he didn't.
[158:37.93]It's gone.
[158:38.53]He deleted it right now.
[158:39.47]It's live deleted.
[158:40.69]Why did you do that?
[158:44.45]I'm never closing this video.
[158:45.73]I'm never closing this tab ever again.
[158:48.71]I'm never turning my computer off.
[158:55.57]What the fuck?
[158:57.20]He deleted it.
[158:59.88]Is he in chat right now?
[159:04.69]Why would I write that?
[159:06.59]What am I doing?
[159:07.53]I'm like, what is this, like a Discord?
[159:14.59]Hey, you here?
[159:20.51]I can't download it.
[159:21.27]It doesn't exist anymore.
[159:22.19]I have it just cached.
[159:23.39]Wait a minute.
[159:24.78]Uh-oh.
[159:26.08]Guys, look at the video.
[159:28.62]I think I only have up to this point.
[159:31.98]Cached.
[159:34.06]Uh-oh.
[159:38.03]Just download this VOD.
[159:46.62]Why did you delete it?
[159:48.56]We weren't done.
[159:51.32]He said he hates you.
[159:53.54]What?
[160:01.37]This is a good video.
[160:05.29]Anchor star.
[160:15.53]That's not where I wanted to start the video from.
[160:20.89]It's just driving around a ship with the fucking anchor down.
[160:24.01]I've stuck to this for a while.
[160:25.96]Yeah, you really have.
[160:27.04]Here's the best part about this video.
[160:31.78]He uploaded this video.
[160:34.10]You don't know the fucking balls it takes to upload this video.
[160:39.42]That's some, like, real, like... That's...
[160:43.66]Come on, like there's gotta be some respect there.
[160:49.56]Being like a pain in the ass for the last like hour and 14 minutes.
[160:53.94]Does he have anything else to do?
[160:58.90]No.
[160:59.24]I don't know.
[161:00.60]Anyway, before you go down into the cellar.
[161:03.26]I was supposed to leave and make this.
[161:06.96]Where is he?
[161:08.01]Hold on a minute.
[161:12.49]Wait a second.
[161:18.97]Wait a second.
[161:36.70]Just checking on something.
[161:45.67]I'm asking him.
[161:48.39]Hey.
[161:50.99]You want me to defend myself?
[161:52.70]No, that's not what I meant.
[161:54.72]You said defend yourself.
[161:55.82]No, I mean, like, well, because you deleted the video.
[161:59.16]You're a snake.
[162:00.36]On the stream, you say, oh, this is a good video.
[162:03.26]In private, you want to defend yourself?
[162:06.20]If it's a good video, I have nothing to defend.
[162:10.37]Oh, he's right.
[162:11.69]I said, hey, you want to come in and defend yourself?
[162:15.43]Well, defend yourself on it.
[162:16.43]Why did you delete it?
[162:18.35]I didn't.
[162:18.59]I privated it.
[162:19.87]Why'd you do it?
[162:21.09]I thought it would be funny.
[162:23.83]You want to watch the rest of it?
[162:26.02]I'm at six minutes.
[162:27.32]We're committed at this point.
[162:28.36]You got to watch eight minutes of me.
[162:30.96]Like, I can't believe watching this back because I have blocked this from my memory since I uploaded it.
[162:36.00]I can't believe you got to act two while I was doing this.
[162:38.32]I'm not wearing gear.
[162:39.73]I know.
[162:41.35]Why do you think it was so frustrating?
[162:45.85]What difficulty was this on?
[162:48.74]Uh, it says Torment 1 at the top right.
[162:50.78]Really?
[162:51.40]I must have been in some pretty good shit.
[162:55.72]This is Star, by the way.
[162:57.88]This is the guy.
[162:59.14]This is I'm the guy in this video.
[163:01.67]Yeah, ready?
[163:02.23]Listen, ready?
[163:03.37]Consider for a second.
[163:05.43]Have you considered not going into the cellar?
[163:08.31]That's him.
[163:09.63]We got a live interview with the guy that uploaded this video.
[163:13.95]Wow.
[163:15.46]If you want any pro tips on becoming a successful YouTuber, now would be the chance to ask those questions.
[163:20.79]Alright.
[163:21.21]Okay.
[163:21.59]Alright.
[163:21.89]Let me make sure I'm making myself nice and big here.
[163:27.77]So I've got questions for YouTuber.
[163:31.72]When was the last video that you uploaded?
[163:35.78]The Netflix video that you promised that you would watch, you never responded to me and then did a video watching stream and still didn't watch it.
[163:43.49]Because I watched it off stream.
[163:44.45]I watched it after I told you that.
[163:45.75]Yeah.
[163:47.19]Well, I guess you had a lot to say about it.
[163:54.64]I saw the video.
[163:57.43]I saw the video.
[163:58.25]I can even quote you pieces of that video.
[164:00.85]In private.
[164:01.80]In a private video.
[164:03.38]Okay, after this you can quote.
[164:05.22]After this I'll quote the video.
[164:07.96]Okay, then we'll see.
[164:09.16]But first of all, so my last video was two years ago.
[164:11.96]Wait, wait, what was your last video?
[164:13.00]It was like three and a half, four years ago.
[164:15.14]Defend yourself.
[164:16.28]Okay.
[164:19.33]Like a million views on YouTube is worth like $64 now.
[164:22.55]I thought you were going to say 64 viewers on Twitch.
[164:28.89]It's about accurate.
[164:29.65]It's about accurate.
[164:32.53]64, yeah.
[164:38.02]And Twitch was just more fun at the time.
[164:43.56]64 viewers.
[164:44.62]Yeah, I haven't been paid by YouTube since April.
[164:47.71]Really?
[164:48.95]Yeah.
[164:50.97]Wait.
[164:51.87]Maybe March, actually.
[164:52.91]Wait, no, it was April.
[164:53.77]How does that make any sense?
[164:57.60]Well, it's just such a successful platform.
[165:00.82]Wait, before we play the rest of the video, before we do anything else, when you say the word, like, for instance, are you watching this right now?
[165:08.04]You probably have it muted or something, right?
[165:10.35]Yeah, it's muted.
[165:11.47]Okay, so anytime you say the word money, does that happen to you when you do that?
[165:19.45]Your neck?
[165:20.67]No, just say money.
[165:22.89]Money.
[165:24.07]Money.
[165:24.55]I can't do it without having a fucking mean face.
[165:28.71]No, that's just you.
[165:30.23]Money.
[165:33.37]Are you ready?
[165:33.77]Because if you go into the cellar, all of these guys are going to turn into snakes.
[165:39.67]If you don't go into the cellar, they won't ever.
[165:41.99]So cue the video up then.
[165:45.72]I'm at 5 minutes and 39 seconds.
[165:47.18]You're really going to wait?
[165:49.06]Yeah, this is your video.
[165:51.06]It's not like, hey, by the way.
[165:54.54]Why am I doing the out the window thing?
[165:56.58]The train, like, star!
[165:57.62]Star!
[165:58.72]Take it!
[166:03.04]You gotta get to 5 minutes and 39 seconds.
[166:06.34]Uh, I'm there.
[166:08.02]You get 5.39?
[166:08.68]Yep.
[166:09.97]Okay, 3, 2, 1, play.
[166:13.79]Ever turn into snakes.
[166:22.83]See, this all could have been avoided.
[166:25.43]Is that a shitty joke over?
[166:27.53]No, it's not.
[166:28.77]He fucking is still going.
[166:29.95]Alright, I'm reading again.
[166:34.67]Is this turning more into, like, Mela is mad than it is anything else?
[166:38.97]We just walked completely backwards.
[166:41.78]Did we walk back here?
[166:43.00]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[166:45.78]No!
[166:49.00]I was supposed to be done with this by now.
[166:51.00]Look, look, the vomit is so strong it goes up the hills.
[166:56.68]Another one has gone.
[166:58.26]You're not getting in here unless you're on a real character.
[167:01.71]Just so you were wondering, I'm not looking at the chat anymore.
[167:05.17]I'm not even paying attention to it anymore.
[167:07.21]Pause it, pause it, pause it.
[167:11.95]What are you saying?
[167:13.37]I'm saying...

[168:07.46]Oh, because I wouldn't let you in the game.
[168:08.94]Okay.
[168:09.50]You ready?
[168:10.68]Yeah.
[168:11.48]One, two, three, go.
[168:13.86]You get the fuck away from me.
[168:17.58]Will you leave me alone?
[168:18.69]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[168:22.69]If I invite this... If I invite you right now and you come in on the Witch Doctor, I'm leaving the game and I'm blocking Ster's account.
[168:33.85]What are you doing?
[168:41.51]Why are you not talking?
[168:43.50]What the fuck are you doing?
[168:44.68]Oh, can I get a revive?
[168:51.82]Revive.
[168:54.42]Can I get a revive?
[168:55.14]This video isn't over.
[168:59.29]Jerma.
[168:59.75]That was like full, like minute.
[169:01.45]Okay.
[169:08.32]Buh.
[169:18.24]Where'd you go?
[169:19.06]My ally has left.
[169:20.58]What?
[169:23.30]Where do I do this?
[169:26.00]My game's crashing.
[169:28.48]My game is legitimately crashing.
[169:29.54]Oh my god, you're so annoying.
[169:30.90]You've crashed my fucking game.
[169:32.40]What's the point of this video?
[169:38.73]Holy shit.
[169:42.89]Your whispers actually broke my game.
[169:46.98]Okay, I have to look up when Diablo 3 came out.
[169:49.24]What's the next co-op stream we're going to do?
[169:51.56]What do you think?
[169:53.94]Oh, I don't know.
[169:56.60]Play with that guy.
[169:57.34]You want to play Diablo 3?
[170:01.79]It came out two years before this video.
[170:04.07]So I think, yeah, I was just surprised you wanted to play Diablo 3.
[170:07.67]And I don't know, it probably upset me.
[170:12.31]I think this was also before Reaper of Souls.
[170:14.67]Was that before Reaper of Souls?
[170:17.10]I think so.
[170:18.02]Because in the beginning of the video, all the items were still garbage.
[170:21.46]Yeah, why would I have played Diablo 3 again?
[170:23.68]I think I was trying to talk you out of playing Diablo before the video started.
[170:29.05]That's my guess.
[170:29.99]That's me defending myself of why that happened.
[170:34.63]Interesting.
[170:35.25]Okay.
[170:35.87]Interesting.
[170:39.03]Interesting.

[171:14.05]Like, we're talking about, like, cryptic behind-the-scenes, like, Discord, defend yourself shit going on here.
[171:18.70]You don't think it's not going to happen?
[171:21.22]I don't think it can happen when it was planned to happen.
[171:25.12]I still want to get out there, but not.
[171:27.92]Yeah.
[171:28.62]That's alright.
[171:29.54]Oh, well.
[171:31.03]Well, it would have been great to see you.

[171:36.23]It would have been good to see you.
[171:40.27]Yeah, I'll let you get back to your stream.
[171:42.74]I don't have very much left because I have to go to the doctor.
[171:45.64]Oh, I can come.
[171:46.16]You're going to come to the doctor with me?
[171:50.12]I mean, if you need someone.
[171:52.76]We should, let's play something like this week or something.
[171:54.82]We'll figure it out.
[171:55.32]We'll get something fun.

[172:04.47]He's got great fucking videos.
[172:07.99]Link him.
[172:13.56]You got anything else to say before you leave?
[172:17.07]Quote the video.
[172:17.77]Why do you have to, like, leave?
[172:19.05]I don't know.
[172:20.77]I don't know.
[172:21.33]Why am I saying bye to you?
[172:22.45]You were saying, like, it was nice to see you.
[172:25.41]You know, you're so busy.
[172:26.29]Your stream's going so well.
[172:27.51]And then I came on.
[172:28.45]And now it's like, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[172:31.87]I'm, like, trying to, like, shoo him off the stage.
[172:34.29]Like, alright, well, that was fun.
[172:36.15]I mean, we could all just watch videos.
[172:39.65]We could.
[172:40.79]Okay, do you got one?
[172:44.01]Um, I don't know what you have and have not watched on your streams already.
[172:47.52]Throw some out.
[172:48.06]Throw some out.
[172:49.98]Uh, did you watch Handball Showdown?
[172:52.85]I did.
[172:53.80]I think you did.
[172:54.36]I did.
[172:55.36]Wait, no, did I?
[172:56.50]I did.
[172:57.20]No, I think I did.
[172:57.64]I know that I did on my stream.
[172:59.18]Yeah, I did.
[173:00.40]That video is one of those.
[173:01.60]Oh, by the way, we talked about a little bit.
[173:05.95]How many videos do you think that you made that you never uploaded, that never saw the light of day, that you wish you, like, saved in a folder so, like, this year you could, like, just watch them?
[173:14.43]I can tell you that I have some videos I never uploaded that I'm so glad...
[173:20.33]that you never did?
[173:21.13]I only very recently deleted when me and you played Half-Life 1 together.
[173:27.37]Oh.
[173:30.91]Do you remember?
[173:31.57]I do.
[173:33.97]Wait, you, you, you, you like deleted all that.
[173:37.93]I, I had like the footage of it and it was like unedited raw footage.
[173:42.35]So it was like 30 gigabytes of footage of us playing.
[173:44.75]So I finally was like, I need the space.
[173:46.28]This is, I'm never doing, I'm never going to look at this again.
[173:52.22]That's unfortunate.
[173:54.20]Yeah.
[173:54.54]But, no, I've done that quite a few times.
[173:55.88]Remember when we played that game where we weren't talking at all, but our characters were like text-to-speech?
[174:02.89]The game where you're on the boat?
[174:04.11]It's like the murder mystery?
[174:06.13]Vaguely.
[174:06.69]Oh, yeah.
[174:08.23]You didn't upload that?
[174:09.43]No.
[174:10.43]I didn't upload it because it was too... We didn't talk.
[174:13.57]There's no dialogue.
[174:14.37]It's just you and me giggling to ourselves for ten straight minutes, edited, while our characters say stupid shit to people.
[174:24.91]I wish it was there because I'm having a hard time remembering.
[174:27.55]Yeah.
[174:29.57]Well, I don't have it anymore.
[174:31.07]That's what I'm saying.
[174:31.85]I wish I still had some of these old videos that never saw the light of day.
[174:36.35]Alright, well, what do you got?
[174:37.11]Do you got anything for us?
[174:39.21]Did you watch Dastardly Devil Boy?
[174:43.24]Dastardly Devil Boy?
[174:45.28]No.
[174:46.92]I forget what the games are called.
[174:50.04]Lucius?
[174:51.16]Lucius, yeah.
[174:54.35]Is that a star pick?
[174:56.35]It's a star pick.
[174:57.67]I'm trying to pick from your videos, and that was a good one.
[175:02.17]Alright, well, let's watch Dastardly Devil Boy.
[175:05.05]Let's see if I'm remembering things.
[175:16.81]Alright, you tell me when you're ready.
[175:18.97]Um, I am ready.
[175:22.27]I am also ready, but not quite.
[175:26.06]Ready?
[175:27.24]Yeah, I'm, yeah.
[175:29.26]I'm sorry.
[175:29.98]Alright, three, two, one, play.
[175:35.99]That's a sick intro.
[175:37.47]Thanks.
[175:37.73]Father?
[175:38.67]Father?
[175:41.89]When can I go and play with the puppies, daddy?
[175:45.14]I'm Lucius.
[175:46.14]I'm Lucius.
[175:47.08]I'm such a bad boy, such a bad, bad boy.
[175:49.04]I'm Lucius.
[175:50.06]I'm Lucius.
[175:51.02]I'm gonna kill you.
[175:51.92]What?
[175:52.16]What?
[175:52.40]Are you not enjoying this?
[175:59.08]What?
[176:01.67]What's wrong with this guy?
[176:10.21]Okay, now I remember why.
[176:11.45]This guy was just trying to get me, and yell at me and stuff, and now he's just marveling at the sink.
[176:18.27]We're gonna try this.
[176:22.50]Hello?
[176:23.96]Yes, please.
[176:25.04]Take me to the authorities.
[176:27.82]You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times, this guy would look down and be like, I shouldn't walk on the green shit!
[176:34.38]No.
[176:34.92]Of course not.
[176:39.01]Murder.
[176:39.53]Murder.
[176:40.27]I'm Lucius.
[176:41.23]I'm Lucius.
[176:42.17]Hello, nurse.
[176:42.85]Hey, what's going on, guy?
[176:44.13]I'm Lucius.
[176:45.15]I'm Lucius.
[176:46.05]I'm gonna take over your fucking mind.
[176:47.95]I'm Lucius.
[176:48.89]I'm Lucius.
[176:49.85]I'm gonna go walk into a... I'm scared.
[177:04.02]What?
[177:04.32]What did I see?
[177:05.76]Hello, Harry Potter.
[177:10.16]What am I seeing?
[177:11.08]Dude, I'm like a supernatural psycho dragging around a bookshelf.
[177:15.54]Like, what do you mean, what am I seeing?
[177:16.70]Do you know there's another one of these?
[177:20.66]Oh, yeah.
[177:22.29]Did you play it?
[177:23.27]No.
[177:23.85]Apparently it sucks.
[177:24.95]What the fuck is this?
[177:25.75]Yeah, it sucks.
[177:26.39]I remember watching someone play it.
[177:27.63]Pick up those ciggy butts.
[177:28.51]Pick up those ciggy butts.
[177:32.09]Oh, she actually did.
[177:33.21]She just took them.
[177:33.97]What?
[177:34.31]You stole those cigarettes?
[177:35.90]What?
[177:38.48]I clearly threw those on the ground.
[177:40.49]So now, I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[177:43.97]What's this?
[177:44.51]I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[177:45.97]You wanna get canned?
[177:47.39]You ever been to Kansas?
[177:48.59]I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[177:50.65]This lady keeps ducking.
[177:52.51]This is just psychic hitman.
[177:53.87]What are you eating?
[177:54.89]Invisible food?
[177:55.65]It really is.
[177:56.11]I love invisible food.
[177:57.01]What about the guy on the left?
[177:57.77]What's he doing here?
[177:58.43]Just wearing that nice shirt?
[178:00.13]Fucking naked guy?
[178:00.97]Oh, fuck.
[178:01.75]I forgot about this part.
[178:11.58]This guy's not gonna have- he's gonna have a lot of trouble.
[178:20.46]What the fuck did that- He dropped it!
[178:25.10]You're not even doing anything!
[178:26.54]You dropped it, dude!
[178:30.90]This- without context, this is really strange.
[178:36.33]What's this guy's story?
[178:37.17]I wonder if it's a fall story.
[178:38.45]Huh?
[178:40.25]Huh?
[178:41.23]Yeah, your arm's gonna be fine.
[178:42.27]Don't worry.
[178:42.73]I mean, we're in a hospital right now.
[178:44.54]You're probably here for surgery or something.
[178:46.56]Let me get you to your emergency room surgery room.
[178:49.73]Jeez.
[178:51.21]So on the right here, as you can see, I'm gonna give you a little quick tour before we go to your room.
[178:54.71]That's gonna be the operating room, but I want to introduce you to one of my favorite doctors.
[178:58.67]Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman.
[179:01.03]Dean Dingleman, here is the patient you'll be operating on.
[179:03.65]His name is Kryden, Kayden, whatever his name is.
[179:06.70]Kayden.
[179:06.98]I just want to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery.
[179:11.84]Just take you up the floor, too.
[179:13.24]That's all we gotta do here.
[179:14.44]Just don't mind me.
[179:15.34]I mean, this thing's always broken.
[179:16.84]Gotta throw a can of dog food at it to make sure we can get it open.
[179:20.02]But, yeah, I mean, can you believe that weather?
[179:21.93]I mean, we had, like, a foot of snow today.
[179:23.73]I mean, can you believe?
[179:25.43]No.
[179:26.19]Oh, ruined.
[179:26.87]You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?
[179:31.95]I'm gonna push a guy out a fucking elevator.
[179:34.60]Fucking high C ecto-cooler.
[179:36.10]Let's see how you deal with this one.
[179:38.25]Alright, sir, so go ahead and... I knew it.
[179:40.82]They always slip.
[179:41.64]It doesn't matter if they're sitting, if they're on a fucking workout bench.
[179:43.99]It doesn't matter.
[179:44.83]It does not matter.
[179:54.32]I was going to say, I remember having a very long discussion about something editing on a naked man.
[179:59.40]I couldn't remember what it was.
[180:00.52]I didn't do that.
[180:01.17]No, it's because I was trying to figure out how I wouldn't get the video banned.
[180:05.55]Because I think that guy's dick is there.
[180:08.78]It is.
[180:09.50]It's just full on, like, that guy's dick, his dick is there.
[180:14.00]So I was like, I don't want to, that's so funny, the guy's walking around naked.
[180:18.08]So we were trying to figure out, hey, how do I make it so I can upload this part and not, like, show a guy's dick?
[180:27.03]So it was just like, oh, we'll just keyframe clothes on him.
[180:34.60]I really wanted to upload it just uncensored too because that's so stupid the guy's just walking around just naked his like ai got screwed up or something and he was just supposed to be clothed but he was just walking around the office like this oh whoops I forgot to tell star to pause start pause your video just just keep going you pause too much ever anyone ever tell you that
[181:01.91]You pause, and then you talk for, like, a minute, and then you rewind a minute, then you rewatch the same thing, get back to where you were, and go, see what I said, and you pause it again, and then you rewind, like, ten more seconds.
[181:10.70]No, I don't.
[181:11.30]I've linked it, like, twice.
[181:12.36]Alright, get to 417.
[181:13.36]Look, it's something you've got to give insight.
[181:18.09]You've got to, like, give insight to the video.
[181:21.61]It's director commentary that I have... Three, two, one, go.
[181:24.53]I didn't even tell you what time to go to.
[181:26.39]Whatever.
[181:27.04]You said 4... Oh, my...
[181:33.76]And I can see it on your stream.
[181:35.86]Everybody just saw that I came back from... I loaded into the game, and this happened.
[181:41.54]I don't know what happened here.
[181:43.00]I had nothing to do with this.
[181:44.48]Absolutely nothing to do with it.
[181:49.57]Naked guy come back?
[181:52.87]Who's gonna get the sandwich first?
[181:57.77]Who's gonna get the sandwich?
[181:59.07]What?
[182:04.21]I didn't poison that sandwich.
[182:06.59]I did not poison that sandwich.
[182:08.47]That guy just died.
[182:10.38]Because he ate a dirty sandwich.
[182:12.04]Wait just a second here.
[182:23.18]So you two... That's normal.
[182:25.66]You should be doing that.
[182:27.24]There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot at the same time.
[182:30.14]I mean, why...
[182:39.01]What are you doing?
[182:40.83]Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called... What would happen if this would happen?
[182:45.35]So today, in this new episode of... What would happen if this was going to happen?
[182:49.37]We have a thing of donuts here, and we've got these pills.
[182:52.23]We're going to combine them, and we're going to see, you know... What would happen if this was going to happen?
[182:57.08]See, the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him.
[182:59.70]He's going to pick up those donuts.
[183:01.12]Oh man, I mean, like, what's going to happen here?
[183:02.46]He's going to eat these donuts.
[183:03.40]He loves donuts with a giant pill box on them.
[183:06.20]And oh, whoa!
[183:09.14]so uh next episode on what would happen if this was gonna happen is that you I think so wait what I tried to like yeah at the very end I I had like three lines of dialogue in this video for no reason it's because you're just in the call yeah
[183:31.20]I tried to explain this before, but sometimes one of us would just be sitting in... See, back in the day, we didn't have Discord.
[183:38.27]We had like a Mumble or a TeamSpeak or like Skype.
[183:43.58]And you just would have to see if somebody was hanging out in like your TeamSpeak.
[183:48.54]go in, oh, I don't see any names, and then leave.
[183:51.39]Sometimes somebody would just be in there with their microphone muted, and you'd come in and just be like, oh, hey, what are you doing?
[183:57.67]Oh, I'm just recording a video.
[183:59.15]I'm just making a video.
[183:59.99]And then the other person would just be sitting there.
[184:01.31]I think that happened a few times for videos you made, too.
[184:05.72]Yeah.
[184:06.24]Like, I would just be there, and I would just... Because we were in the same call, you would just react to something I would just say, and you don't even realize that you were doing it.
[184:14.16]You just were because you were in the call.
[184:17.74]Like...
[184:18.94]What was it?
[184:19.26]My go-go Nippon video where Mela entered while I was recording it and I didn't know he joined.
[184:24.43]Which is such a hard thing to explain to people what happens in that scene and like why it's so weird.
[184:30.71]But yeah, we had a very open relationship with our voice chats.
[184:34.28]Yeah, because that was how you communicated.
[184:36.24]Because it was... Skype sucked.
[184:39.02]And nobody wanted to use it.
[184:40.78]The program was like a piece of crap.
[184:42.90]So the only way you could even communicate was you had to have... It was almost like AOL Instant Messenger.
[184:49.21]You just had like your... I'm away right now, but oh hey, are you here?
[184:53.89]But screen share was cool.
[184:55.57]I wish they would bring that to Discord.
[184:56.91]Are they bringing screen share to Discord?
[184:58.79]It's there.
[184:59.79]They actually added it a while back.
[185:01.83]Really?
[185:02.33]It's very good.
[185:03.67]Oh my god, I am late to the party.
[185:07.83]Have I updated my Discord in like two years?
[185:10.81]Have I skipped every update?
[185:12.75]I may have.
[185:14.61]You're gonna want to update that Discord.
[185:16.11]Alright, I got time for, uh... I got time for like two or three more.
[185:21.34]Because I have to go to the doctor, so... People are saying zombie penises.
[185:29.62]Zombie penis?
[185:30.66]Is that...
[185:32.72]you you're gonna you're gonna delete this video live or are you gonna keep it up no I I'm just I'm thinking of something else because I watched that when I did my thing oh well let's get one let's get one that you and I both haven't done I I like you have a loadout video I suspect it's probably loadout
[185:57.17]Yeah.
[185:57.69]I'm just curious because remembering that loadout existed gives me a tickle sometimes.
[186:03.97]Do you want to know?
[186:04.59]Okay.
[186:04.81]I just, just, just, this is just, I don't know.
[186:07.89]This is funny to me for some reason.
[186:09.15]Do you, would you like to know my YouTube search history?
[186:14.69]I just clicked in the, in the thing.
[186:15.95]Okay.
[186:19.66]So the first let's just read, let's go down the list.
[186:26.02]ludwig fight McDonald's review review funny cats and then ned and varus like scene what like I wanted to re-watch like a game of thrones scene
[186:57.21]what about you what's your last like youtube search how do you even see what your previous ones are just go to youtube and then click in like the search bar nothing shows up I don't think I've searched anything and I reformat it somewhat recently ludwig I like don't use youtube at all anymore neither do I which is why I think some of these are old
[187:23.44]Alright, so which one?
[187:24.40]How convenient.
[187:25.42]The loadout?
[187:27.28]No, it's a bad idea, and I know it's a bad idea.
[187:29.24]Is it a shitty video?
[187:30.98]I don't know.
[187:31.92]I don't remember it, so it must be.
[187:34.56]I don't remember even having a video.
[187:37.06]Are you sure it wasn't one of yours?
[187:39.32]No, I'm scrolling through your videos.
[187:40.84]I saw it.
[187:41.26]We could watch a Starforge video.
[187:45.60]Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[187:48.94]Yeah, that's right.
[187:49.64]Yeah, let's watch the Starforge one.
[187:53.22]That one sounds pretty good.
[187:58.23]Ster Forge.
[187:59.11]Is this the first time you ever used this name?
[188:02.71]Is this how you changed to Ster?
[188:06.05]I think this was even before I ever used Ster on anything.
[188:12.24]I think so, yeah.
[188:13.64]This is 2015.
[188:14.44]This is a while ago.
[188:16.62]I think I just thought Ster Forge sounded funny.
[188:20.14]okay I get I have a rumor too you do you have rumors too well I don't have rumors I have every almost like 50 chance when I'm streaming you will hear the lawn being mode or a thunderstorm really well then there's one guy who plays his music really loud here it's just people just blasted down the street as loud as they can in like a motorcycle or a car
[188:43.75]It's almost like when they get to my window, they go, oh, it's time to go to like fifth gear.
[188:50.01]I know he's up there.
[188:51.59]It's just like, okay.
[188:52.95]It's always like that.
[188:53.69]You need to build one of those noise counseling walls.
[188:57.30]Noise counseling?
[188:59.20]Yeah, forget it.
[189:00.24]Are we going to launch this video?
[189:01.44]Yeah.
[189:01.70]Are you ready?
[189:02.96]Yep.
[189:03.74]One, two, three.
[189:11.16]Change it from like simple to like good and then take a look around.
[189:15.18]People thought that was me.
[189:16.28]That looks pretty good.
[189:17.70]Yeah.
[189:18.58]Why does it look like I'm looking into the inside of my computer?
[189:23.32]Oh, yeah.
[189:24.28]All the weird.
[189:24.80]I'm looking at microchips.
[189:25.84]Oh, my God.
[189:26.48]Walk around.
[189:27.24]It's like magnified grass.
[189:30.35]Walk.
[189:33.77]Oh, it really is.
[189:34.93]It's like a bunch of movie screens.
[189:37.11]Who's watching me?
[189:39.25]It's you.
[189:39.77]You're watching.
[189:40.61]No, you have to walk into one of them.
[189:42.10]It takes you to another dream dimension.
[189:43.66]Yeah, I thought that too.
[189:44.54]I thought it was going to be amazing.
[189:46.04]Turns out they're all just bushes.
[189:47.96]Yeah.
[189:49.54]Oh, what's this crazy?
[189:50.50]Oh, it's a bush.
[189:51.67]What's that over here?
[189:52.61]It's a bush.
[189:54.15]Something tells me we're going to need to reload the game.
[189:56.53]I'm not doing it.
[189:57.91]You're going to play the game like this?
[189:59.87]Yeah, we're just going to move on.
[190:01.69]Why?
[190:02.25]Hey, you want to see?
[190:03.55]Hey, dude, check it out.
[190:04.47]I got a hamster.
[190:05.55]My mom got me a hamster.
[190:06.82]Oh, be gentle.
[190:08.06]Yeah.
[190:10.30]Why?
[190:10.68]Try and get your view and see where the tunnels are.
[190:14.04]Yeah, maybe another 100 feet this way.
[190:15.12]Uh-oh.
[190:24.21]Something else is starting to show me now is my gun in my hand.
[190:27.11]What the fuck?
[190:27.66]It's a Hydralisk.
[190:29.14]Huh?
[190:29.38]Behind you.
[190:30.14]Let's not fight this.
[190:35.76]Kill it.
[190:37.62]There's nothing in here.
[190:39.52]I can't look at this screen.
[190:41.67]This is awful.
[190:44.89]This is awful.
[190:46.13]Alright.
[190:48.11]I want to jump off that cliff in front of you.
[190:50.26]Did this video get darker?
[190:51.60]That mountain?
[190:52.58]Yeah, I'm going to jump off the mountain.
[190:54.18]It was a problem with YouTube.
[190:55.46]I don't think I knew about it back then.
[190:56.32]I'm going to get to the top of that and I'm going to jump off.
[190:57.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[190:59.02]Where when you upload videos, it's going to make things dark.
[191:01.34]Wait, wait, you won't listen.
[191:03.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[191:05.41]I'm not moving.
[191:06.25]I'm standing still.
[191:07.13]What?
[191:08.59]Does anyone see your control settings?
[191:25.12]It's fucking long.
[191:26.12]You like my moon shoes?
[191:29.29]Well, use your moon shoes and fix the spinnies that aren't spinning.
[191:33.87]How do I do that?
[191:34.37]Do I just remove them?
[191:35.17]Yeah, you have to hold key.
[191:36.25]You have to get in there.
[191:39.04]What button is it?
[191:39.78]Just make sure there's a couple of glow sticks in here.
[191:41.06]Alright.
[191:45.02]Uh, what button do I press?
[191:48.90]Where did you go?
[191:52.85]You didn't tell me there were gonna be monsters!
[191:54.57]I didn't know!
[191:55.71]I didn't know!
[191:57.45]Yeah, don't you mean like an obstacle course, right?
[192:04.05]What's going on?
[192:05.29]What is it?
[192:05.63]Turn it off!
[192:07.02]What the fuck is that?
[192:09.78]Is that a truck full of bees?
[192:11.44]We got more bored with the actual game.
[192:14.58]The actual game is like... No!
[192:16.24]No!
[192:16.78]No!
[192:17.50]What are you doing?
[192:18.80]Are you alive?
[192:21.36]Yeah.
[192:22.48]Where are you?
[192:24.74]They're following you now.
[192:26.94]I love how they believe that they're doing this.
[192:29.12]That's so awesome.
[192:30.74]You've got a pyramid and I've got a pyramid.
[192:32.64]We need to put them together.
[192:34.28]We need to make a bigger pyramid.
[192:48.33]They're on me.
[192:50.39]They're on me.
[192:54.24]He just like toppled it over.
[193:01.06]Well, the video also is running at like five frames a second.
[193:03.28]How are these guys not dead?
[193:04.86]I don't know.
[193:05.50]It's absurd.
[193:09.34]Why would you build this?
[193:11.04]What's the point?
[193:13.97]there is always a point progress hey yeah I uh I don't know I'm not sure the helipad is in the correct spot but uh that sucked did it just get launched out it just tapped one of them and boop it's out but not even dramatically here we're doing this again what the fuck are there enough of them

[193:39.18]Not enough of them.
[193:40.44]Okay, yeah, no, there's enough.
[193:41.42]There's enough of them.
[193:42.36]There's enough.
[193:42.74]That's enough.
[193:43.66]We're down to, like, 14 frames a second.
[193:48.54]A Hydralisk is in here, like, fighting them.
[193:52.97]Oh, this hurts.
[193:55.25]This Hydralisk is pissed.
[194:01.25]That's not the stream, that's the video.
[194:07.17]Dude, I gotta get out of here.
[194:09.13]I'm about to exit the game.
[194:11.70]Oh!
[194:13.76]Through the wall.
[194:20.71]Am I wearing it on your screen?
[194:24.85]It's like five mini guns.
[194:27.93]It's like, wait, wait, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[194:31.37]It's seven mini guns.
[194:32.47]There is just seven mini guns coming out of random places on your body.
[194:36.05]Oh, I remember this.
[194:36.51]It just goes like, can I shoot them?
[194:45.08]I just ripped my headset out.
[194:46.06]I distinctly remember how fucking loud that was.
[194:51.57]This is the clip that taught me what contagious laughter Reddit was.
[194:55.35]Did that kill you?
[194:59.82]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[195:01.10]Alright, what if I shoot it down?
[195:18.08]See you later.
[195:19.12]Woo-hoo-hoo.
[195:20.34]Woo-hoo-hoo.
[195:23.65]Hey, Star.
[195:25.05]You ever seen the movie Jason?
[195:27.93]Ow.
[195:28.75]Ow.
[195:34.79]Cut it.
[195:36.25]No.
[195:37.35]No.
[195:39.61]I'm at 10 frames a second.
[195:40.93]I can't tell what's happening.
[195:41.69]All I know is I'm just trying to keep myself alive.
[195:44.01]What is happening?
[195:45.23]Why is this all down here?
[195:46.78]You've done a terrible thing down here.
[195:50.32]You put too many down here.
[195:52.34]You put way too many.
[195:53.46]I need to get out of the pit.
[195:56.30]Help me.
[195:56.62]I'm stuck here.
[195:57.69]I can't get out.
[195:58.13]Where's the whole safe hole?
[196:00.47]Good luck finding it.
[196:01.33]I'm getting launched back up.
[196:02.63]Oh, yeah.
[196:02.95]We made a safe hole in the side to get out of the carnage.
[196:05.53]The safe hole.
[196:06.07]The safe hole.
[196:06.63]There was a safe zone.
[196:07.61]No, no, no.
[196:08.11]I see it.
[196:08.59]I see the safe hole.
[196:10.13]You've got to get in the safe hole, dude.
[196:12.45]Shut up.
[196:13.01]I know.
[196:14.57]You've got to get in the safe hole.
[196:15.91]Blighttown, somebody said.
[196:21.41]Alright, so, question.
[196:23.15]This is a very important question.
[196:25.01]So, uh, I have a question.
[196:25.97]Yeah.
[196:26.35]Did that game ever release?
[196:46.93]That's a good question.
[196:47.79]The answer is probably no.
[196:49.23]Was that game an early game?
[196:52.54]That was an early game, yeah.
[196:55.76]Was there ever a 1.0 of that game?
[196:58.92]I'm looking it up.
[197:00.65]It's been like three or four years.
[197:01.83]It has to be.
[197:11.23]The game was released.
[197:12.73]That's probably not the actual release.
[197:15.26]I'm going to assume no.
[197:17.06]When did it was released?
[197:18.98]It says September 18th, 2014.
[197:22.98]I feel like you made that video.
[197:29.04]When was that video?
[197:30.94]2015.
[197:31.08]It flopped miserably and the devs continued to scam people with new games.
[197:37.35]Really?
[197:38.49]I don't know.
[197:41.40]It was removed from Steam, apparently.
[197:43.23]Okay.
[197:45.85]Alright, we can do two more.
[197:47.43]And then I've got to go to the doctor.
[197:49.75]Okay.
[197:54.57]Let's see here.
[198:11.45]Everyone wants to watch Jerma is mad.
[198:14.05]Yeah, I'm seeing like two options.
[198:15.85]There's only two options.
[198:18.09]Yeah, but I feel like we've seen that already like a bunch of times.
[198:22.60]Didn't you watch it on your stream?
[198:24.94]Definitely.
[198:26.12]Yeah, we've seen it.
[198:27.68]We've done it.
[198:28.28]We've seen it already.
[198:36.19]I think we're just gonna have to make a new video.
[198:38.15]We've seen them all.
[198:38.77]Hey, just like, let's make a new Jerma is mad.
[198:42.57]You can just make another one.
[198:44.23]Yeah, in like Diablo 4 when it comes out.
[198:46.53]Yeah, just follow me around and I'll be like, fuck, fucking idiot, fuck you!
[198:50.24]And then just cut off.
[198:50.92]Fuck, dude.
[198:51.74]And you can make a new video.
[198:52.76]Fuck, dude.
[198:53.40]Fuck, dude.
[198:56.26]Hello?
[198:57.42]Hello?
[199:01.28]What the fuck was that?
[199:03.58]I'm a soundboard boy now.
[199:05.26]Oh, okay.
[199:06.48]I mean, I said that.
[199:07.72]That wasn't me that just said that.
[199:09.94]No, it wasn't you.
[199:11.70]Why do you have a, like, fuck dude?
[199:14.59]They're doing the he doesn't know.
[199:15.89]I record people's outrage in Overwatch now.
[199:20.49]It's my pastime.
[199:23.63]Oh.
[199:24.85]I know you had that, but I thought that was me because I just said, fuck dude.
[199:29.69]Yeah, and it reminded me that I have two separate people saying it.
[199:32.75]What else do you have on there right now?
[199:35.34]Fucking ungrateful DPS fucking cuck.
[199:39.48]People get mad.
[199:42.22]Is this Jerma uncensored right now?
[199:46.78]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[199:48.74]This is not... Nope.
[199:52.30]I'll give you the longest Jerma uncensored right now, but you have to wait till the end because the last guy who talks is the best guy.
[200:00.39]You're ramming DPS against a fucking wall and praying to God that it fucking works, but you're fucking Jack shit at the game.
[200:07.27]Dude, you're fucking a mercy player.
[200:08.91]Show out.
[200:09.29]Let's try guys.
[200:13.10]Let's try guys.
[200:15.94]Why?
[200:17.32]Why do you?
[200:18.74]I was looking for the mute.
[200:19.68]I was.
[200:23.26]You asked.
[200:25.62]I said mad people in Overwatch.
[200:27.31]Why do you do that?
[200:28.19]Why do you do that?
[200:30.05]Because... Okay, for one, it's really funny when you play it back to the person who said it and they get to hear themselves.
[200:36.23]Right.
[200:36.43]That's kind of a defining moment of life.
[200:40.09]And the second reason is... Grab one of me.
[200:43.22]Ready?
[200:43.76]And save this for whenever you need it.
[200:45.46]Yeah.
[200:47.42]Can we get somebody on the fucking... On the cart, please?
[200:49.78]Because that's like the... It's been like ten fucking minutes straight of this bullshit.
[200:53.06]Somebody else change to DPS, too.
[200:55.53]Can we get somebody on the fucking, um, on the cart, please?
[200:57.85]Because that's like the, it's been like 10 fucking minutes straight of this bullshit.
[201:00.43]There you go.
[201:02.57]That's you.
[201:03.09]Just, what about it?
[201:03.69]Just play, just so you can play that somewhere.
[201:05.61]I can't wait for this play of the game, dude.
[201:09.26]That's my one wholesome one.
[201:12.26]You need a wholesome one.
[201:14.26]Listen, listen to the sounds of despair.
[201:16.32]Like, I don't understand.
[201:17.80]Please.
[201:22.52]He's given up.
[201:24.66]His life is over.
[201:25.42]Alright, let's watch another video.
[201:26.46]We need to watch a video.
[201:28.16]I don't want to listen to, like, the spy cam, like, recording people.
[201:33.02]We want to talk about YouTubers.
[201:35.40]Alright, let's go.
[201:36.18]When are we going to watch Jerma play the goat game?
[201:39.88]Oh, no.
[201:41.36]No, you said it.
[201:42.22]Why did you have to say that?
[201:46.00]God damn it.
[201:46.66]Why did you have to do that?

[202:43.12]No, I did not.

[203:39.24]Okay, because you can't end on a goat game.
[203:40.72]You have to end on a high note.
[203:42.73]Remind people that this isn't really who you are.
[203:44.89]It doesn't define you.

[204:36.34]Fuck, I think this is funny.
[204:39.99]My legs are so weak.
[204:42.53]I really need to strengthen them on the treadmill.
[204:52.68]The Tower of the Goat was once key to the treasure of the gold buried underneath.
[205:00.29]Mortimus!
[205:01.55]The gray goat.
[205:03.00]Held the tea to the tower for generations.
[205:07.42]An Excalibur.
[205:09.60]The black and white goat.
[205:11.16]What?
[205:15.53]Nice setup.
[205:16.75]Somebody on the computer over there?
[205:17.77]What's it?
[205:17.97]They're eating dinner?
[205:20.29]Hi.
[205:21.89]Hi, I'm Mr. Goat.
[205:22.82]I hope you're enjoying your dinner.
[205:31.04]This game is amazing.
[205:34.38]Trampoline, baby.
[205:36.42]I used to have one of these in my backyard.
[205:38.64]Want to see what I used to do on the trampoline, guys?
[205:40.42]If you gave me a trampoline right now, I'd do three backflips on it.
[205:44.62]Hold on, this does not seem to be right.
[205:46.44]Did I go trampolining with you?
[205:48.02]Nobody can really jump this high on a trampoline.
[205:50.80]Pause the video.
[205:51.52]Pause the video.
[205:55.65]We went to a trampoline fun park.
[205:59.21]And how sick was I at trampolining?
[206:03.50]You were probably, besides, like, the people we came with, the only adult there.
[206:11.26]And you were very good.
[206:13.86]You were better than all those other six-year-olds.
[206:22.25]Take that to the grave.
[206:25.58]I think we were probably the only people over the age of like, I mean, we may be the only people that were over 30 that didn't have children there.
[206:34.89]I was like dunking on people.
[206:36.35]I was like jumping.
[206:37.07]I wasn't over 30.
[206:40.49]Was I?
[206:40.84]I don't know.
[206:44.72]How long ago was that?
[206:47.02]Dude, I was like jumping so high from like thing to thing and I was doing like back flips off the wall.
[206:53.85]I was, like, I was flexing on everybody there.
[206:58.55]We did the thing where, like, I was like, yo, yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[207:01.57]And everyone was, like, there was, like, a ton of people making a circle around me.
[207:04.67]And I was, like, dancing and fucking doing flips and shit.
[207:06.58]People were, like, clapping along.
[207:09.54]Yeah.
[207:09.92]If only we had a video of the trampoline park when people would know.
[207:14.48]It was pretty fun.
[207:15.06]But I was, I was, I confirmed that I could do a backflip off the wall.
[207:18.76]I just want you to.
[207:19.32]Yeah.
[207:19.88]Thank you.
[207:20.73]Well, the walls were trampolines.
[207:22.45]Yeah, but I jumped into the wall, jumped off the wall, backflip off the wall, land, another backflip, then into a twist, landed, and then, like, the skater, like, 9, 10 out of 10 sign spin, then landed.
[207:34.88]Yeah, I held up a 9.
[207:35.96]I thought it could have been a little better.
[207:38.09]Yeah, but, I mean, I'm pretty fucking sick.
[207:41.03]Yeah.
[207:41.43]At that.
[207:42.85]Alright.
[207:43.29]Ready?
[207:43.87]3, 2, 1, unpause.
[207:44.83]Yeah.
[207:45.75]Catch me!
[207:46.41]Catch me, please!
[207:47.44]Help!
[207:49.86]Not gonna invite me to your backyard party.
[207:55.19]I'll show you.
[207:56.41]That's not a bad goat voice.
[207:57.67]I wanted the hot dogs.
[208:00.91]What?
[208:01.21]I was trying to kick the thing over there and it didn't even work.
[208:06.03]You know what?
[208:06.35]It is gonna work.
[208:08.33]I'll make it work.
[208:12.13]He's flying.
[208:13.41]He's flying.
[208:14.63]And he's on fire.
[208:15.51]Oh.
[208:16.97]Oh.
[208:18.94]And these people are all still dancing.
[208:21.56]Do you see what just happened to the guy that was hosting the event?
[208:24.20]And what kind of dance is this?
[208:28.65]Do this dance?
[208:29.47]No.
[208:30.15]I've never seen anybody do this dance unless you were a toddler.
[208:34.58]These people are doing the I'm a toddler learning how to dance to like Mickey Mouse music.
[208:39.58]Insensitive streamer makes fun of white people dances.
[208:43.67]Like this?
[208:44.27]Honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse and make sure my petunias are in line?
[208:49.03]Oh, sure thing, honey.
[208:50.53]Oh, the glass doesn't break.
[208:53.54]I've got your favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you.
[208:57.80]It's Pop-Tarts!
[209:01.76]How many videos there's that in?
[209:04.36]I hate going grocery shopping.
[209:05.78]I always have to go grocery shopping.
[209:07.52]It sucks.
[209:08.66]I'm gonna get Coca-Cola Classic.
[209:10.30]That's like my favorite.
[209:11.61]And I'm gonna get Doritos, potato chips.
[209:13.81]Those are good too.
[209:15.33]I also want... What else do I want?
[209:18.85]I guess I could use a little bit of ham.
[209:20.51]Do they have ham here?
[209:21.95]I don't even know.
[209:22.67]Maybe.
[209:23.05]Excuse me.
[209:25.11]Sir, do you have ham?
[209:26.59]Oh, he's not here anymore.
[209:28.51]Oh, she's dead.
[209:31.15]Frodo, you must take the little goblins out of the cave of mystery.
[209:37.23]Don't do it.
[209:37.89]And you must, you shall not pass into it fast enough.
[209:42.01]You could go first, because best friends let their best friends go first on the slide.
[209:49.04]Okay, have fun.
[209:51.60]Have fun on the slide.
[209:57.50]Wee!
[209:59.30]This is so much fun.
[210:02.62]Woohoo!
[210:03.58]I'm laughing at it.
[210:04.54]I am.
[210:05.80]That's humorous.
[210:09.46]Oh, whoa.
[210:10.08]Sorry.
[210:10.48]I'm sorry.
[210:10.80]I'll pay for that.
[210:11.48]I'll pay for that.
[210:12.81]I'll make sure you get, like, an extra monitor.
[210:14.61]A 27-incher, not just a 22-incher, whatever that is.
[210:19.17]Who are you, Bill?
[210:19.79]How's life?
[210:21.01]How's the kids?
[210:22.95]Yeah, the kids are good, huh?
[210:24.05]Yeah, that's great.
[210:26.40]Everybody expects me to just trash this place.
[210:30.72]But you know what?
[210:32.42]I think I'm going to have some self-control.
[210:34.68]Because I could just trash this place right now.
[210:40.44]And it's really starting to build up that I really want to do it.
[210:45.13]But I think I'm going to hold back just a little bit right now.
[210:49.25]Get out before I change my mind.
[210:52.43]Pretty humorous.
[211:03.76]hello sir this more true I feel like this video is like two hours long yeah I was gonna say this is one of those videos where it's only it's only six minutes and it just feels like it extends time yeah oh pause by the way okay oh you went 506.
[211:29.82]You're just making it take longer by pausing, you know?
[211:31.95]Yeah, but if something went... Yeah, I know.
[211:33.77]Okay, three, two, one, go.
[211:34.49]The goat station.
[211:36.95]Did I tell you that today was baseball day at the gas station?
[211:43.86]Oh, do you know this stream that I'm doing?
[211:45.54]We haven't talked in two months.
[211:46.74]Thank you for coming.
[211:48.12]Hey, Mortimer.
[211:49.26]Welcome to the party.
[211:50.76]Hey, Frank.
[211:52.12]How are you?
[211:54.55]What are you cooking on the grill?
[211:57.07]We've got some various meats that we are cooking here on the grill.
[212:01.37]That better not be goat meat.
[212:05.74]If it's goat meat, I'll be upset with you.
[212:10.82]It is lamb.
[212:12.56]My family, we eat lamb.
[212:14.20]Same difference!
[212:16.68]Come here.
[212:17.30]It's another two hours have gone by.
[212:19.17]Holy... This is like Katamari Damacy.
[212:25.77]Pretty good breakfast.
[212:26.37]How much stuff can I pick up?
[212:34.17]Whoa!
[212:34.65]Whoa!
[212:35.52]Whoa!
[212:36.56]Whoa!
[212:40.90]That's humorous!
[212:47.31]This is the equivalent of going back and looking at your yearbook.
[212:52.53]Going back to your junior high yearbook and being like, what did I do back then?
[212:57.27]It's because back then, we didn't have the common sense to say, there's two minutes of good clips I have.
[213:03.93]Why don't I just combine it with another game?
[213:06.94]It always had to be all one game.
[213:09.35]It did.
[213:09.69]You're trying to make... And then it has to be, like, at least five minutes to make it feel like it's worth anyone's time.
[213:14.83]Who's going to upload a two-minute video?
[213:16.53]Yeah, it was always like, oh, this is, like, three and a half minutes.
[213:19.57]Fuck, is that long enough?
[213:22.18]I haven't had a video up in, like, four or five days.
[213:27.88]But, yeah.
[213:35.26]Watch Damnation?
[213:35.90]I heard you mention a weird stream...
[213:39.81]At the beginning of the stream, so I don't know if it is.
[213:43.09]I'm doing a Twitch-controlled robot carnival.
[213:51.46]We're going to have a bunch of carnival games that Twitch chat controls and tries to win.
[213:56.42]And clowns and shit.
[214:02.94]This is reminding me that at E3, Twitch had a stream where you controlled the person walking around E3.
[214:11.52]And what they did.
[214:12.18]And it did not go well.
[214:14.76]This is going to go very well.
[214:17.04]Okay.
[214:17.34]Because I'm worried about you.
[214:21.63]Hey, I'm going to mute for a second because this is like spoiler.
[214:23.89]So like they're not going to be able to hear me.
[214:26.29]Okay.
[214:33.13]What?
[214:40.21]Yep.
[214:43.02]Not muted?
[214:43.98]No, no, you're muted now.
[214:47.34]I'm muted.
[214:48.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[214:49.20]I muted myself to say that to you, so then... Okay, well, chat was saying not muted.
[214:53.68]I don't think they actually heard it.
[214:55.65]You're not muted.
[214:57.31]Okay.
[214:58.03]I was going to repeat word for word what you said, but then you hit me with a fucking bomb.
[215:03.01]And I cannot, in good conscience, repeat that.
[215:07.43]What do you mean, in good conscience?
[215:09.61]I just... I feel like...
[215:13.67]Like, if I was just a Jerm of viewer and, like, I didn't know you, and I heard that in chat, I'd feel really bad for you.
[215:23.85]That puts people in a very uncomfortable situation.
[215:26.87]Wait, what?
[215:27.61]Wait, why?
[215:30.57]Wait, mute!
[215:31.15]Mute!
[215:31.55]No, no, no, I can't, I'm gonna, hold on.
[215:46.28]Oh, wait, we can just talk, like, after the stream.
[215:49.28]Yeah, like, I'm not bound to your stream.
[215:52.04]Oh, yeah.
[215:53.12]Well, what am I doing?
[215:56.59]I feel like I'm, like, scared that this stream's gonna end and we're never gonna talk for, like, two months.
[216:00.59]Well, never gonna talk two more months.
[216:02.49]I couldn't just say hi to him.
[216:04.19]One more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[216:08.53]Um... What really happened?
[216:16.30]garbage garbage what we need we need to end on a very good one no that that video's what's wrong with that video it is a good video you know what I wouldn't say garbage I was being harsh people have been asking for gta4 like all stream though what alright what's what's your favorite gta4 video I what's the moment like the fucking uh zebras dance and shit it's like the club uh club tornado

[216:55.12]Is this?
[216:56.74]Wait a minute.
[216:57.18]Wait a minute.
[216:57.56]I remember this.
[216:58.42]I remember.
[216:58.82]And we never used it.
[217:00.68]We never used this.
[217:01.52]Remember I did this every fucking GTA video?
[217:04.42]Hold on.
[217:04.92]We're going to pause it after we watch for a minute.
[217:06.58]We're going to pause after a minute.
[217:08.16]Okay.
[217:08.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[217:09.38]Okay.
[217:09.68]So we're doing Club Tornado.
[217:10.50]Club Tornado.
[217:12.04]Mm-hmm.
[217:13.05]And there was a very specific thing that I used to do every time the loading screen would pop up.
[217:20.96]And it would be that.
[217:22.92]Let's see.
[217:23.24]Let's listen.
[217:23.78]Are you ready?
[217:26.75]Three, two, one, go.
[217:29.07]Shout out to all those back home.
[217:32.05]Hey, mom, there's a new night.
[217:34.17]That's not what it was.
[217:36.36]Didn't I used to say, like, I used to go, like, din, din, din, like, star, um, like, what was it?
[217:42.29]It was something about, like, was it about, like, weirdly enough, it was about, like, how- I think you did used to do a star, you suck.
[217:48.75]It was star, you suck, star, you suck, and then it's something about, like, I, I don't even remember.
[217:54.83]I have no idea.
[217:56.75]But let's just play.
[217:57.27]Something about-
[217:59.01]Wait, what?
[217:59.51]Say that again?
[218:01.07]I think it was star you suck, star you suck, gonna shove a broom up your ass.
[218:04.21]It was something about me getting a broom?
[218:05.95]What?
[218:06.21]No, no, I think you doing it to me.
[218:08.75]What?
[218:11.67]No.

[218:22.76]Club Tornado.
[218:23.44]You open this box.
[218:27.09]We've done the establishing transition shot, so now I'm here at Club Tornado.
[218:31.08]That's how you can tell that I traveled to get here.
[218:32.74]There's people throwing up outside.
[218:34.80]Probably because Club Tornado is that amazing of a place.
[218:38.60]Fun is measured in vomit.
[218:39.92]You get off a roller coaster, you fun.
[218:42.25]It was fun.
[218:42.83]Get the fuck out of my way.
[218:45.25]I fucking love this game.
[218:46.13]Is this it?
[218:48.25]I don't get it.
[218:48.69]This is just like any other club.
[219:01.23]now we're leaving we don't like this club yeah this club sucks club tornado you guys been there Nancy don't fucking come to club tornado it's not even cool it's kind of cool I like it he's sitting down no he's not he's
[219:35.75]Watch out.
[219:36.17]Watch out.
[219:37.45]Watch out.
[219:42.07]Ten people just get fucking thrown around by a tornado?
[219:44.37]That's a good feat, man.
[219:47.07]That guy is on fire being an impressive motherfucker right now.
[219:51.35]Oh, it's good to go out.
[219:52.07]Don't worry about it.
[219:52.63]Yeah, I'm good.
[219:54.55]Oh, yeah, baby.
[219:55.91]You like my dance moves?
[219:57.11]I learned these dance moves from TV.
[219:58.29]I remember we tried to figure out the dancing mechanics for like 30 minutes.
[220:01.76]Let's go in the bathroom and make out or something.
[220:07.60]I can't believe it just happened.
[220:22.15]I'm done.
[220:24.25]I'm fucking done.
[220:25.23]Another episode like that, and I'm going to shit my pants.
[220:28.59]That was a problem quite frequently, apparently.
[220:38.76]No!
[220:39.68]Damn it.
[220:40.42]Oh, that build up.
[220:41.20]Oh my fucking god.
[220:42.26]Club Tornado.
[221:03.18]What the fuck happened?
[221:05.00]Ever since I made that video about Club Tornado, this place just sucks now.
[221:08.85]It's not even worth coming back here.
[221:10.69]This is pathetic.
[221:12.77]I'm leaving the worst review I can leave.
[221:17.75]No!
[221:19.56]No!
[221:20.90]What have I done?
[221:21.76]Why would you do this?
[221:24.96]I don't want to dance with this dusty old herd.
[221:36.25]Well, if that club's ruined, let's try this knockoff, like, imitation club tornado.
[221:45.06]Already.
[221:45.80]Oh, my God.
[221:48.48]Everyone's just, look at these guys just standing around looking at you.
[221:50.84]I don't want to get me out of this dude corner.
[221:55.26]This isn't even a tornado.
[221:56.32]This is just a bunch of guys just, like, stuck up in the ceiling.
[221:59.20]This is just club vacuum.
[222:01.68]Come on, you can't be giving zebras alcohol, because then they just throw up out of their chest.
[222:06.20]Everybody knows this.
[222:07.30]That's why there's the law.
[222:08.18]You don't serve bearded zebras.
[222:11.37]Someone's got to put a stop to this.
[222:13.03]And there's only one thing that can stop this, and I think you all know what it is.
[222:24.89]That was a pretty good night out.
[222:29.67]Through all of our GTA videos, you just had the truck button bind.
[222:33.75]So at will.
[222:34.78]Yeah, you just had at free will would just be pressing a button.
[222:40.60]And it would always, always just a truck.
[222:43.64]You never did delete that.
[222:44.76]I bet you if you open GTA 4 right now on your computer and you did like control T, it would fucking work.
[222:51.50]It's probably still there.
[222:56.58]That's so fucking funny.
[223:00.09]well that's it I'll see you next year man I gotta go to the doctor I mean I could give like you could just end the stream we could do like a webcam doc like I could give an opinion you always gotta make it weird alright he's muted he's muted
[223:31.80]No, I'll let you say goodbye.
[223:33.38]Go ahead, say goodbye.
[223:34.00]Goodbye, everyone.
[223:34.96]Thanks for letting me exist on JermaStream.
[223:39.73]I normally don't exist.
[223:42.17]But this last hour of being out of the bottle has been very nice.
[223:47.03]Now get back in there until I have some more wishes!
[223:51.09]I left a call.
[223:54.84]He's always gotta make it weird.
[223:58.04]It's just kind of what he does.
[224:01.94]But anyways.
[224:05.66]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[224:07.06]I gotta get out of here.
[224:07.86]I have to go to the doctor.
[224:12.44]That's what friends do.
[224:13.74]They make it weird on your stream.
[224:19.17]I don't make it weird.
[224:19.83]No, I don't.
[224:20.47]I just go like this.
[224:23.73]That actually looks like... Look at how fucking bad that looks.
[224:29.62]That looks like fat and then like tiny.
[224:32.92]That's Popeye.
[224:35.07]That's worse than Popeye.
[224:43.81]This is what happens when you put on like the Walmart muscle suit.
[224:47.76]This is what you look like.
[224:55.06]Bad ratio.
[224:58.48]Alright, guys.
[225:03.87]I will see you tomorrow.
[225:06.45]That didn't even pop up, but you can hear it.
[225:09.81]Thanks to Star for joining us and adding some insight to some of those videos.
[225:17.21]I'll see you tomorrow.
[225:17.81]We're gonna do the regular time tomorrow.
[225:19.31]I just had to start early and leave early because of the doctor, so... If you're taking off, take care.
[225:25.87]See you tomorrow.
[225:26.95]We're probably gonna play Sam & Max tomorrow.
[225:30.69]We'll probably start Sam & Max Season 3 tomorrow at the regular time.
[225:38.73]And then after that, we'll see.
[225:41.35]There's a couple things I want to do.
[225:50.71]So we will do them.
[225:53.25]But, uh, good night!
[225:55.90]Let's do the bits.
[225:57.16]Well, good night, right.
[225:57.86]It's not even like fucking two o'clock.
[225:59.50]Three o'clock.
[226:03.18]Let me scroll back here.
[226:06.14]To four hours ago.
[226:19.53]Raid Kiwo after the pits?
[226:21.53]Yeah, that sounds... Yeah, we'll do that.
[226:24.51]What's Kiwo doing?
[226:33.47]What is Kiwo up to?
[226:35.77]GTA?
[226:36.57]Hey, we entered on a GTA video.
[226:37.75]Might as well... Go see some more GTA.
[226:42.40]But, so we had... Earlier we had Anthrobots.
[226:45.44]Thanks for the three bucks, Anthrobots.
[226:47.42]No message.
[226:48.32]Three bucks.
[226:48.76]Appreciate it.
[226:54.58]And then Froidean weapon, 250.
[226:58.12]Thank you, Froidean.
[226:59.06]Can't stick around to watch live today.
[227:00.34]Hope you're feeling better.
[227:02.10]Jermahart, good luck at the doctor.
[227:03.96]Yeah, this is a follow-up to the colonoscopy stuff.
[227:08.45]So, one I can't really miss.
[227:13.29]But yeah, I'm feeling alright.
[227:15.33]I've had some stomach issues over the last couple days that have just been annoying.
[227:23.80]But, we'll see.
[227:25.26]Everything should be fine.
[227:28.44]Mitchell, thank you Mitchell for the $15, Mitchell.
[227:32.97]Mitchell says, the glue man basketball video is easily top 5 videos you've ever been in.
[227:37.87]And the pissed off GM has to be my favorite Jerma joke of all time.
[227:42.47]Thank you for everything that you've done.
[227:44.81]I love that video.
[227:47.00]That video is just everything about that video.
[227:51.26]But how long that video took?
[227:52.74]That's a three minute video.
[227:53.76]That's not a long one.
[227:54.46]Maybe we're talking about, oh shit, this video is fucking three minutes long.
[228:02.58]Which one?
[228:02.98]That's the Gabe the Glue Man DeGrossi basketball video.
[228:07.95]What's that video called?
[228:09.13]I think it's just called like Gabe DeGrossi.
[228:13.35]Like b-ball or something.
[228:20.54]I think I changed the title of it a while ago.
[228:22.82]Because the first title was a little... Too, uh... Like, ambiguous, so... It's like his origin story, right?
[228:38.75]But yeah, thank you for the $15, Mitchell.
[228:42.45]It's fun to do this.
[228:43.53]Because, like I said before, when we did this last, like, a month ago or so...
[228:50.97]You just forget all these things that were interesting, that you thought were fun.
[228:55.46]And I'm like just reliving being in the game.
[228:59.46]By the way, that game that people were asking about, like Spy Hacker and the Slacker game, that was called Clandestine, right?
[229:06.01]Clandestine?
[229:06.71]Clandestine?
[229:07.25]What's it called?
[229:07.69]What's the name of that game?
[229:09.43]Somebody asked and I just didn't even think about it.
[229:12.48]But it's fun to do.
[229:18.78]Jerma has a sexy voice.
[229:21.66]Thanks for the $15.
[229:25.16]Thank you.
[229:30.97]Thank you for the $15.
[229:32.33]Jerma has a sexy voice.
[229:35.21]Really appreciate it.
[229:41.15]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $2.50.
[229:42.57]Your patch notes video is basically a Black Mirror episode.
[229:47.54]Kind of.
[229:51.28]Did that come out before, Black Mirror?
[229:53.98]It may have.
[229:59.74]That was what, like 2014?
[230:03.41]2015?
[230:05.75]Interesting.
[230:13.25]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the $2.50.
[230:15.17]Dork Cube, we watched that video.
[230:19.13]Feeling a bit sentimental, so here's some bits.
[230:21.79]Thank you for being so good and funny and for making one of my favorite videos, The Door Cube.
[230:27.31]I love this community and I've made some great friends here.
[230:29.82]That's really great to hear.
[230:32.62]Your name is that video.
[230:34.70]I'm glad you liked that so much that you're able to put yourself in this community so much.
[230:41.26]And get that much joy out of it, so that's great.
[230:42.77]That's good to hear.
[230:44.43]Thank you, Door Cube, for the $2.50 and for sticking around.
[230:49.84]Glad you made some friends.
[230:55.47]I'm glad you still go back to your old stuff.
[230:58.01]I cherish those videos.
[230:59.31]I was even marathoning your main channel with a friend recently.
[231:01.91]Um... That's... That means a lot.
[231:18.02]I really... Anytime somebody says this... I'm just glad you think that.
[231:30.37]No, I'm not perfect.
[231:34.62]So anytime I can hear somebody say that, it makes me not only feel good about the community and about the channel and everything, but... You know?
[231:41.60]You just kind of hope you're doing your best.
[231:44.95]You know?
[231:46.55]So... Thank you.
[231:49.21]I'm glad you have a good enough time here.
[231:56.79]And thanks for being part of the community.
[232:00.13]Hey, Zake!
[232:00.67]Thanks for 250!
[232:01.09]Okay, I watched all your Minecraft videos 312 times.
[232:04.49]Can I see my family now?
[232:05.77]I don't know.
[232:10.55]Just... I don't know.
[232:11.35]Just push the chair away from the desk and go...
[232:15.83]That's up to you.
[232:16.99]That's not up to me.
[232:19.87]Hey, S10WUpdate, thanks for the 250.
[232:22.47]Hey, Jerma, when I said I was going to stop my bitstreak, I lied.
[232:27.24]Anyways, glad we got to see the Jerma greatest hits before you die at a carnival.
[232:32.62]I'm going to be fine.
[232:33.92]Good luck, peace, and love also.
[232:36.76]E-Jerma is going to be the death of me.
[232:40.46]E-Jerma is going to be the death of me.
[232:42.88]What's E-Jerma?
[232:53.57]I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[232:54.57]I think it'd easily be funny to watch.
[233:00.77]Anybody's watched since forever and will keep watching the heat till the heat death of the universe.
[233:18.51]I haven't really looked much into it.
[233:25.83]Frostpunk is an 8 out of 10?
[233:26.85]Hmm.
[233:29.81]What's this?
[233:35.78]Nice, like, turkey.
[233:37.92]That's actually a turkey.
[233:53.80]Played Blade and Sorcery.
[233:54.80]I already have.
[233:55.48]I've played it like two or three times already.
[233:58.60]I've played that already.
[234:02.54]But thank you, Lycry.
[234:05.12]Jerma lied about Taco Bell.
[234:06.16]Thanks for the $2.50.
[234:06.92]Who took the pictures for the privacy pile?
[234:13.46]I did.
[234:13.68]That was me.
[234:22.92]Googly Gareth, thanks for the $10, Googly Gareth.
[234:26.62]Hey, Jerma boy, it's your old pal Googly Field, back with another donation and animation.
[234:30.94]Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for all the laughs throughout the years.
[234:35.22]Ooh.
[234:37.68]Uh, well, I'm gonna have to play this, like, right now.
[234:46.93]Oh, fuck, no, I can't.
[234:51.49]I'm going to hold on to this till tomorrow.
[234:53.31]We'll play this tomorrow.
[234:54.75]Because this is like a four and a half minute video.
[234:58.37]I have to go to my doctor's appointment.
[235:02.38]So tomorrow we are going to watch this Jerma animated streaming superstar.
[235:07.76]Source filmmaker video.
[235:12.82]We'll probably just start with it.
[235:19.44]Those of you that want to see it before, there's the link.
[235:22.86]We're going to watch it on stream tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow evening.
[235:30.59]Okay.
[235:31.89]But thank you, Let's Googly Gareth, talented source, filmmaker, animator.
[235:38.55]We'll watch it tomorrow.
[235:40.54]We were talking about that.
[235:42.64]That it might be fun to go do some of these that you didn't get to see the whole thing.
[235:46.83]You just got to see a little snippet of info.
[235:49.39]You got like five minutes of footage when there was like hours of stuff to see.
[236:06.71]Once there's not a whole lot of new games and new material and new stuff coming out, then we'll probably go back and try some of the old stuff again.
[236:15.62]I'm into it.
[236:21.02]Uh, but thank you.
[236:22.94]Serial Star.
[236:25.00]Jerma lied about Taco Bell.
[236:26.20]Thanks for the $2.50.
[236:27.06]Give Star half my bits from this stream or I'm gonna sue.
[236:33.62]I'll PayPal him like fucking... I'll PayPal him some money.
[236:36.64]Yeah, whatever.
[236:38.62]I'll buy him a fucking massage chair.
[236:42.06]No, those are like five grand.
[236:43.76]Um... I'll give him half those bits.
[236:49.66]Alright, that's fine.
[236:54.00]Thank you, Egg... Egg...
[237:01.55]That's a vocal contract.
[237:02.81]No, it is not.
[237:04.45]I just rejected it.
[237:07.31]It's time for slime.
[237:08.15]Thanks for the $20.
[237:08.55]It's time for slime.
[237:10.80]Hey, Jerma, your MS-DOS streams are some of my favorite in recent memory, so I made a short, ditty, and accompanying video to celebrate them.
[237:20.32]Oh, there's like a couple of fucking great videos here.
[237:22.71]Yeah, we'll start with this tomorrow.
[237:25.37]I just do have to get out of here in the next like five minutes, so I've got to run.
[237:31.72]But thanks for the $20.
[237:32.94]It's time for slime.
[237:33.61]We'll open up with these two videos tomorrow.
[237:39.98]They look pretty interesting.
[237:43.17]Dr. Zoot Suit, thanks for the $5.
[237:44.35]Hey, Jerma, I can't watch for a week because I'm going to the San Diego Comic Con.
[237:49.14]I'm really nervous this year, and your infectious confidence in front of an audience is exactly what I need before I go.
[237:54.48]I won't say why, but let's just say that any chat members who go to the masquerade at the con will know why very, very plainly.
[238:03.31]See you in a week.
[238:03.93]Thanks again for being the cool internet uncle.
[238:08.37]I don't know what that means, but hope you have a good time.
[238:16.04]Thank you for the five dollars?
[238:24.14]Is it, like, a nervous thing?
[238:29.34]Do you, like, dress up in a costume?
[238:30.86]I don't know what that is.
[238:52.12]Oh, is it a furry thing?
[238:54.00]Oh.
[238:55.61]Oh, I see.
[238:57.39]Well, whatever.
[239:03.81]I'm not competing.
[239:04.75]Oh, I see.
[239:11.18]What did I get furry for?
[239:12.22]Oh, that's just what people were saying.
[239:13.94]I've just been trying to figure out what it is. ...
[239:24.67]Do you just believe random people?
[239:27.31]Well, when, like, 20 random people write the same thing... It's just a costume contest.
[239:34.02]Oh.
[239:43.19]He's gonna dress up as Glue Man.
[239:52.76]Hey, thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the 250.
[239:54.08]Other than Jerma Rumble live action, which video are you most proud of?
[239:57.62]Most of them, actually.
[240:07.55]Most videos, I actually... I mean, I'm obviously making little jokes and talking shit about random videos, but every video I've made, I was happy with at the time, you know?
[240:19.37]They can't all be perfect.
[240:25.56]But yeah, like maybe 20% or 30% of videos I've made, I wasn't like 100% happy with.
[240:30.49]But most of them, I thought they were fun.
[240:36.39]Otherwise, I wouldn't have uploaded them at the time.
[240:39.91]So, that is the thing.
[240:42.70]Thank you, CluelessSniper.
[240:44.76]That was you.
[240:47.06]C4G, thank you for the $2.50.
[240:50.16]Someone asked for the chart at the end of the coin game, but I was asleep.
[240:54.56]Here it is.
[240:57.87]It's pretty strong.
[241:02.98]That's a pretty strong chart.
[241:05.16]Let's take a look.
[241:11.19]This is from the coin game stream.
[241:17.59]Let me see.
[241:28.98]That looks like some pretty steady growth.
[241:35.24]And then here is from tonight.
[241:40.54]Not bad either.
[241:41.36]There's a drop over here.
[241:46.97]What is this drop from? ...
[242:00.80]So this is from the coin game, as you see.
[242:02.42]It was pretty steady the whole time.
[242:08.26]Is that top where Goat Simulator was played?
[242:10.60]It is.
[242:18.55]Really?
[242:21.75]That's when Goat Simulator was loaded up.
[242:27.62]Wow.
[242:29.71]Holy shit.
[242:37.28]These are so interesting to see.
[242:38.66]They really are.
[242:39.22]Hey, Goat Simulator was cool.
[242:44.86]That was a pretty good voice, I think.
[242:52.73]But thank you.
[242:53.85]That was C4G.
[242:56.14]You'll probably see one of these once every few weeks.
[242:58.42]Once every, like, month or so, maybe?
[243:00.06]The thing is, though, once we run out of videos, it's kind of it.
[243:01.88]Or ones that I would want to watch.
[243:32.42]But thank you for the 250.
[243:34.52]Thank you, Sim, for the 317.
[243:36.63]They say bonus 31.
[243:37.79]Thank you.
[243:39.71]Mostly thanks for the 250.
[243:40.93]Mostly lost.
[243:42.23]Raid someone, you boomer.
[243:43.41]I'm gonna.
[243:43.73]I'm gonna raid Kiwo.
[243:47.32]I am.
[243:48.06]Let's get the credits on the screen.
[243:51.82]Thanks, everybody, for joining.
[243:52.72]See you tomorrow.
[244:01.74]We will start Sam & Max Season 3.
[244:04.32]Probably do a couple of episodes.
[244:06.42]Here are all the subscriptions, all the new subs, all the old subs, all the community subs.
[244:09.60]Thank you, guys.
[244:11.51]Thank you to all of you.
[244:23.27]And there are a couple more bits to do.
[244:26.85]We've got Dr. Clay for $2.50.
[244:28.79]I have an important message.
[244:29.81]They say pickles, but that's it.
[244:33.91]Pickles is the message.
[244:36.01]Thank you.
[244:38.01]Yubri.
[244:39.45]No, Yuberi.
[244:40.59]Thanks for the $5.
[244:45.59]Sorry to bother, but we've been trying to find the solution to this dilemma for a day.
[244:49.30]What picture is the spray you're using here?
[244:55.26]That's an easy answer.
[244:56.06]That is Burger Boy on Halloween dressed as Ronald McDonald.
[245:04.31]From, like, 2008 or, like, 2009 or something.
[245:12.51]Thank you for the $5.
[245:14.47]Thank you, Jermas.
[245:16.91]Thank you for the $5.
[245:23.87]Thank you for $5.
[245:26.51]Reptio, thanks for the $15.
[245:28.19]Thank you for continuing to make such amazing content.
[245:32.32]I'm trying.
[245:35.41]Sometimes you swing and miss, sometimes you hit a home run.
[245:38.92]But I swing.
[245:40.54]Every goddamn pitch.
[245:42.00]Which is probably not a good idea, but you know, whatever.
[245:44.58]Probably a bad analogy, because that means I strike out all the fucking time.
[245:56.97]Nah, I'm very patient at the plate.
[245:59.03]I take balls, I take strikes.
[246:03.10]My batting average is like fucking 500.
[246:08.68]But thank you, Reptile, for the 15 bucks.
[246:11.00]My pleasure.
[246:12.60]Glad you enjoy it.
[246:15.10]And then finally, Spreo.
[246:16.24]Thanks for 250, Spreo.
[246:17.22]Hey, Jerma, just want to thank you for everything.
[246:18.28]You've inspired me to start streaming and for letting me join this amazing community.
[246:22.94]I've met my best friends from this community.
[246:25.43]You've honestly changed my life.
[246:27.59]Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.
[246:28.99]Looking forward to your future endeavors.
[246:33.26]That's... That's fucking awesome.
[246:39.00]I can't believe... It shocks me all the time.
[246:43.31]But it makes me really happy knowing that, like, this channel, this community, this group, this, like, this... My streams and my videos have been able to lead people to meet some of their best friends.
[246:55.85]That's... I mean, what do you even say to that?
[246:59.09]That's just fucking crazy to me.
[247:02.42]That's awesome.
[247:05.73]Thank you so much.
[247:06.46]And we'll see you again tomorrow.
[247:14.64]I'll be back tomorrow.
[247:15.60]I'll see you at the regular times.
[247:17.12]And we're on 3 to 4 o'clock Pacific.
[247:19.80]Sam & Max Season 3.
[247:20.86]Time to go to the doctor.
