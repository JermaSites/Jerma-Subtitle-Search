[00:09.64]Hey guys!
[00:10.41]Woohoo!
[00:11.33]Today, we're gonna do something a little bit different.
[00:13.87]We're gonna do a Minecraft timed build.
[00:17.57]And I know we're not the best Minecraft players in the world, but that's why we think it might be actually pretty interesting.
[00:23.35]So, how is this gonna work?
[00:25.03]We're gonna give ourselves 10 minutes time, that'll be on the screen, and whatever we build in 10 minutes, we're gonna try and build a person.
[00:32.48]That's today's episode.
[00:33.96]So, whatever we come up with, what are you doing?
[00:38.19]Hello?
[00:39.23]Whatever we come up with is what we're going to end with, so let's see what happens, okay?
[00:43.69]So I have the timer ready right here, and in a few seconds we're going to start building a person.
[00:51.93]So in the comment section, before we get started, in the comment section, let us know how well we did and something else for us to build.
[00:58.16]I want to try and make this a weekly thing, so are you ready?
[01:01.45]Yeah, I've like never played Minecraft before.
[01:05.34]Like in-browser Minecraft, and I guess let's see how bad I am.
[01:09.70]Okay, and we're starting now.
[01:11.77]Go.

[01:14.72]I'm building the right leg.
[01:16.14]Okay.
[01:16.84]Let's make sure... Like, I have the worst creative mind.
[01:20.41]I'm, like, the worst at drawing things.
[01:22.25]Build... We only got ten minutes here.
[01:24.27]Build, uh... Build four squares.
[01:26.69]Four squares going up.
[01:28.33]You absolutely can't, like, tell me how to build my leg.
[01:31.16]It's gotta be, like, symmetrical.
[01:33.30]Okay, hold on.
[01:34.00]Let me see this here.
[01:34.88]Yeah, he needs a red shoe.

[01:38.16]Alright.

[03:48.25]Okay, he needs to... Why is he, like, so... What's with that thing at, like, back here?
[03:52.15]Did I not, like, make his belt long enough?
[03:53.72]No, I... Because he was, like... I told you he was, like, a thin bastard.
[03:56.88]He had to be, like, a little bit bigger.
[03:58.02]Alright.
[03:59.84]Alright.

[04:41.79]That's something we could fix later.
[04:43.33]His body needs to be at least twice the size of his, like, he's gonna be like a weird freak.
[04:48.91]His legs and his, like, butt are bigger than his body, like, are you kidding me?
[04:53.41]Well, he could, like, make a perfect character, like, on Hey Arnold or something, where they always, like, already have screwed up proportions.
[04:59.23]Alright, alright, dude, we gotta get away from the body.
[05:01.22]Four minutes have gone by.
[05:02.14]We have, like, a lot of detail work to do.
[05:05.32]Should we start the arms?
[05:07.29]Yeah, get do it finish what you're doing.
[05:08.71]I'm gonna start the arms.
[05:09.59]It's just wearing a sweatshirt right yeah I'm gonna come out like two or three blocks, and then they're gonna go forward wait Didn't we decide his skin was gonna be orange and he was gonna have green pants.

[06:08.51]Oh, that's his poop.
[06:10.73]Wait, he pooed in the front of his pants?
[06:15.28]That doesn't make any sense.
[06:16.60]Why are you fixing it?
[06:17.88]Because this is his forward.
[06:20.70]When you poop in your pants, I'm sure it covers the front of your pants too.
[06:26.39]Okay, I'm going to start on his head.
[06:27.55]No, he needs to be wearing a necktie or something stupid to make it so we can see where his head is.
