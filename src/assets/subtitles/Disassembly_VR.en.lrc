[00:01.10]Hello.
[00:02.60]Good afternoon.
[00:05.49]Uh, I didn't put this on, so give me a second.
[00:08.31]I don't know why my profile's not here.
[00:11.09]But while we set up, just give me a moment.
[00:14.35]I need to be able to see you guys, which, I gotta get this in the right spot.
[00:17.21]That looks alright, okay.
[00:23.17]There you guys are, in all your glory.
[00:26.31]Let's see here.
[00:28.41]Oh, that's wrong.
[00:29.59]What happened to my profile?
[00:32.09]I gotta put the headset on for this.
[00:37.39]Red text, red text.
[00:41.87]Sorry, I had to do phone calls.
[00:45.79]The headset's gotta be on.
[00:47.43]Fuck.
[00:49.67]Because I can't tell.
[00:52.81]Why did my profile not get saved?
[00:54.83]I don't know.
[00:56.61]Alright, we're not even close.
[00:57.89]Alright, so I gotta bring you guys forward.
[01:00.78]So you gotta come forward.
[01:02.14]Is there a way I can just grab this in here?
[01:05.65]I don't think I can.
[01:06.43]You're not supposed to be seeing this.
[01:12.04]You're like actually not supposed to be seeing this.
[01:16.68]Just pretend the intro is still going.
[01:30.41]Okay, that looks better.
[01:31.29]Hey, there we go.
[01:35.29]Sort of, right?
[01:37.49]Yeah, okay.
[01:40.11]Hello, how are you?
[01:41.01]Let's put this back up.
[01:44.28]Drop that a little bit.
[01:45.34]You guys are too big.
[01:54.72]It looks fine.
[01:55.12]Alright, how do we look?
[02:00.85]Hey, there you are.
[02:01.69]Alright, back to the intro.
[02:08.18]So we are gonna be doing more VR.
[02:11.44]Not drunk today.
[02:15.88]Not today.
[02:17.13]We're sober today.
[02:19.75]We did go over, I was in the chat earlier.
[02:22.77]We were talking about it.
[02:25.95]Not today, yeah, not today.
[02:30.73]Hungover?
[02:31.17]No, that was yesterday.
[02:34.84]That's why I wasn't live yesterday, because I felt fucking like dog shit.
[02:41.22]Nah, it was a lot of fun.
[02:43.04]You get a, uh, drunk stream.
[02:45.10]Maybe like once every few months here.
[02:46.55]What are we gonna play?
[02:49.63]We're gonna start with Disassembly VR.
[02:53.21]Which... Is interesting.
[02:56.49]From the trailer.
[02:58.15]We might go back to Mindshow.
[03:01.71]I might also try to beat Jet Island.
[03:05.39]I don't know.
[03:08.52]Months?
[03:08.84]You mean days?
[03:09.78]Wait, you guys think I just drink?
[03:12.50]Why am I not on camera?
[03:15.02]I'm an actor.
[03:15.58]I should be on camera.
[03:18.68]It depends.
[03:19.01]We'll just kind of go where the day takes us.
[03:23.91]Hey.
[03:24.01]Here we go.
[03:29.71]You felt like dog shit because you were eaten by the dog.
[03:33.28]Still didn't shave.
[03:34.32]I'm not going to.
[03:35.00]I think I'm just going to let it be.
[03:36.92]I'm going to look terrible, but it's fine.
[03:40.76]Kim check?
[03:41.38]Alright, I'll do a Kim check.
[03:44.55]There is nobody in... Nobody in there.
[03:51.67]Right?
[03:52.09]Okay.
[03:55.16]I did get you, though.
[03:55.86]You've got to give me some credit on that one.
[03:58.00]Alright, let me make sure everything is right.
[04:01.40]Let me drink my sewer water.
[04:09.64]Well, you got a relatable superhero, huh?
[04:15.00]I'm gonna go over some adult things with you guys, okay?
[04:19.08]First of all, my wardrobe, you've talked about it before.
[04:26.15]You, I have, you have too.
[04:28.96]I have a ton of like Star Wars and superhero and shirts from like the last 10 years and I don't want to get rid of them.
[04:36.04]They still fit.
[04:39.02]Eventually I'm going to have to get some adult person clothes.
[04:42.79]But I, why?
[04:45.07]This is fabric.
[04:46.59]This is like 100% cotton.
[04:49.47]It protects me from the sun.
[04:51.76]It protects me from the weather if it's raining.
[04:53.32]It protects my skin.
[04:55.58]What else do I... It covers my chest and belly button.
[04:59.30]What else do I need?
[04:59.92]Do I have to go buy new clothes?
[05:05.51]This shit is fine!
[05:12.31]Yeah, I need to get a suit.
[05:13.43]I'm not... I can't wear suits.
[05:15.42]Suits make me uncomfortable.
[05:17.47]I don't know how people wear those every day.
[05:19.49]But the tie and the button up and the blazer and the pants and like the cigar, I couldn't do that.
[05:26.82]I would melt inside of that thing.
[05:28.84]I would need, okay, for me a suit is the same thing as wearing a mascot costume for like a high school football team, okay?
[05:36.04]They have air conditioning units that sit right here.
[05:39.82]If I was gonna get in a full suit, I would need one of those.
[05:43.70]They have to make them for weirdos like me.
[05:48.77]A cigar, yeah, like a cigar.
[05:50.23]They're just like businessmen.
[05:51.41]They just smoke cigars in the office.
[05:54.67]You ever been inside of an office?
[05:56.19]It's like worse than a casino.
[05:57.70]It's full of fucking thick cigar smoke.
[06:05.44]Alright, let's get in here.
[06:06.30]I'm not gonna fuck around anymore.
[06:08.38]Welcome, hope you're having a good day.
[06:10.52]I'm doing alright.
[06:11.04]I'm having a good day.
[06:13.94]Jerma's stuck in the 1950s.
[06:18.40]I saw that show, Mad Men.
[06:21.08]They just drink scotch and smoke cigars.
[06:23.56]Nobody works.
[06:27.36]They just have competitions with who can smell more wine to each other.
[06:32.48]That's what you do at work.
[06:38.78]Alright, let me get in here.
[06:42.56]Make better jokes so the stock goes up.
[06:45.19]I ain't talking about stocks today.
[06:48.04]I'm talking about taking things apart in VR.
[06:51.12]This is Disassembly.
[06:53.00]The ultimate reality destruction game.
[06:57.45]This looks kind of fun.
[06:58.39]This might be your new favorite.
[07:03.31]I untangled everything.
[07:05.39]Weirdly enough, I don't even do this shit when I'm sober.
[07:09.65]I cleaned up everything.
[07:13.29]I plugged in both the controllers, which I don't do that sober.
[07:18.31]I wiped down the lenses.
[07:19.71]Like I drunk cleaned up this room.
[07:22.03]I don't know how, but thankfully these things are at a hundred percent.
[07:29.55]Alright, let's go.
[07:30.19]Give me the other one.
[07:33.04]Welcome to VR.
[07:38.94]No drinking tonight.
[07:45.30]I need to know where my tools are.
[07:46.52]Here they are.
[07:47.77]This is left hand?
[07:49.03]Yes.
[07:56.14]We talked about this already in the chat before the stream.
[07:58.66]But you know when you drink?
[08:00.53]And maybe you drink, like, you drink a little too much, you have, you get a little drunk, and you open up your phone and, oh, did I text anybody?
[08:07.10]No, let me check, just check for five seconds.
[08:09.46]Okay, no, I didn't text anybody last night.
[08:11.36]No, whatever, I was fine.
[08:13.36]I didn't call anybody, right?
[08:14.54]Okay.
[08:15.98]Seven and a half hours of VODs.
[08:18.48]That was my, did I text anybody last night?
[08:22.52]Like, oh, Josh, a fucking eight hours on camera.
[08:28.27]What did I do?
[08:29.45]Did I do anything fucked up?
[08:33.61]No, I kid.
[08:35.07]I was completely with it the whole time.
[08:42.06]But yeah.
[08:42.80]Oh, let me just check my phone.
[08:43.82]I don't think I did anything bad.
[08:46.10]I was fine.
[08:50.28]It's almost 2 a.m.
[08:50.98]in Australia.
[08:51.62]This stream better be worth it.
[08:52.80]Oh, my God.
[08:53.42]Way to put the pressure on.
[08:57.22]What?

[18:48.79]Can I take the top off?
[18:54.32]How do I get a screwdriver?
[18:56.44]Why would you put me in this room without a screwdriver?
[18:58.59]You understand?
[19:06.80]You have to build a tool.
[19:09.88]What do you mean build a tool?
[19:13.10]Smash it.
[19:26.70]That's not working.
[19:27.36]No.
[19:34.52]I don't want to save the screenshot.
[19:43.38]Maybe I can't do this one.
[19:46.71]The door behind me?
[19:49.93]That doesn't have a door here.
[19:52.75]I need access to a tool.
[20:00.40]What did I just do?
[20:01.72]What is this thing?
[20:07.43]Check your pants?
[20:08.27]Tool belt.
[20:11.49]No, I just have two floating, like, magician hands.
[20:15.53]This is just the Smash Bros.
[20:16.97]boss.
[20:17.76]Hold on.
[20:22.08]There has to be a way I can get this off.
[20:38.08]Come on!
[20:41.84]Grip button?
[20:43.25]Press?
[20:48.15]There has to be a way to get off to this.
[20:57.59]Why?
[21:00.07]Why?
[21:01.09]Why would that even be possible?
[21:02.79]Look, I can see it!
[21:07.48]I can do it with my teeth, I swear to God.
[21:09.10]I'll get it.
[21:13.34]Tool required.
[21:17.32]I can't open it!
[21:19.99]Use a shard of glass.
[21:22.99]Holy shit, that person's correct!
[21:25.37]Wow, are you kidding me?
[21:41.46]I'm gonna get hurt.
[21:46.43]I give you a piece of glass.
[21:47.51]Glass!
[21:48.43]Okay, here we go.
[21:55.77]I'm just gonna use the pointed end right here.
[22:08.82]Can I get this smaller?
[22:17.38]That's not gonna work.
[22:21.99]The panels?
[22:37.06]This is exactly what it's like when you build your own Ikea desk.
[22:39.98]Seriously, what do you mean the panels?
[22:41.86]Help me.
[22:43.05]Glass on the panel, what about this thing?
[22:51.21]What is this?
[22:52.11]Can I use this?
[23:07.96]Just get out in the middle here.
[23:16.34]You hit me!
[23:18.48]There's a point right here.
[23:27.62]Say goodbye.
[23:28.24]Oh my god.
[23:37.40]This is too hard.
[23:56.61]No, what?
[24:04.11]Right menu button?
[24:18.68]Give me it.
[24:21.32]Left right to choose, grip to use.
[24:23.84]Oh my god.
[24:30.47]I can't fucking believe it.
[24:32.49]That would not break the glass behind me.
[24:37.87]You fucking caveman.
[24:40.30]These weigh like a quarter of an ounce.
[24:42.34]Did I get it?
[24:43.08]Alright.
[24:44.18]Oh!
[24:55.73]Mission complete.
[24:58.13]It's hard to see where the lines are right now.
[25:01.33]Where am I?
[25:01.83]Okay.
[25:08.09]Got it.
[25:09.37]What other tools do I have?
[25:10.31]I got a wrench.
[25:14.41]I got a hex wrench, crowbar, precision driver, test pen, a fart finder?
[25:21.96]No, part finder.
[25:26.33]What are these?
[25:27.47]Precision driver pliers?
[25:28.97]Get it off!
[25:47.86]Get it off!
[25:53.26]This is the tutorial, just give me the way the screwdriver go.
[25:58.64]Okay, let's go.
[25:59.20]Nice.
[26:13.64]So this is what it looks like inside.
[26:16.46]Interesting.
[26:17.04]I thought it was like a bunch of wires and computer parts and stuff, because for a desk to like, for those doors to open, I'm surprised it's this simple.
[26:29.09]Alright, now I can... Oh, the support's going down.
[26:34.57]Alright, stop breaking the glass.
[26:39.88]It's gonna give me a headache.
[26:43.92]Alright, now what?
[26:48.38]Oh, the top is off.
[26:52.07]Now, can I pull these?
[26:53.97]I think I can pull the sides off now.
[26:56.37]Let's get in a good position.
[27:05.56]Okay, now I can pull this off?
[27:12.65]How do I get this off?
[27:13.85]What's down there?
[27:14.47]What is this?
[27:18.87]A coin?
[27:20.07]This is money.

[27:32.93]I did it.
[27:33.19]I went... Now what?
[27:38.42]Did I do it?
[27:39.58]Wait.
[27:46.76]There's another one.
[27:47.28]Wait.
[27:47.52]Parts six.
[27:49.76]There's two more of these somewhere.
[27:51.89]It's right there, right?
[27:55.23]Where's the other one?
[27:57.81]How do I take that...
[28:00.61]What are the other parts?
[28:07.56]There's six more parts.
[28:09.28]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[28:14.24]The base can't be pulled apart.
[28:20.14]Take out the part finder.
[28:36.16]Jesus Christ.
[28:38.91]Uh-oh, they're coming in.
[28:40.59]The invasion.
[28:43.25]Sir, they're coming in at 44 knots a second.
[28:46.52]Alright, it's right here.
[29:08.76]What?
[29:10.54]How can...
[29:38.19]There's three parts left.
[29:41.55]What are they?
[30:02.32]One, two, three!
[30:05.43]That's it!
[30:11.26]Disassemble.
[30:11.94]Best time.
[30:12.60]Two hours and 42 minutes.
[30:15.52]Two minutes and 42 seconds?
[30:25.44]I've been live for 31 minutes.
[30:31.27]Two minutes?
[30:34.59]I don't understand that.
[30:35.57]Hold on.
[30:43.35]Can you guys not hear the sound effect?
[30:53.44]Well, that's odd, but this game, I kinda like this game.
[30:57.34]That was the side table, what's next?
[30:58.76]Show it to me.
[31:04.02]So that's it, let's go to the next one.

[31:28.38]Alright, now I know how to play.
[31:29.74]Let's see.
[31:30.72]Is it connected?
[31:32.74]Not connected to anything.
[31:33.70]Let's get a good look at it.
[31:35.58]Anything in the bottom?
[31:37.22]Nope, there's this wire here.
[31:55.40]Just stand here.
[31:57.86]Oh my fuck, whatever, just leave it.
[31:59.12]Alright, so what do we got, how many parts?
[32:00.98]39.
[32:01.86]Alright, let's go.
[32:06.30]Screwdriver, we got, what do we got?
[32:07.76]We got a couple of screwdriver points.
[32:10.66]No.
[32:14.04]Is this screwed on?
[32:16.62]No, I don't get it, I'm done.
[32:19.66]Take the bulb out, right?
[32:23.56]Oh!
[32:26.22]That actually, like, hurt me in real life.
[32:39.47]Aw, just call me Shaky Hands Elbertson.
[32:43.52]Alright, I'm just gonna be trying to get in here with the precision game.
[32:46.72]God.
[32:47.26]Alright, I gotta get the wire cutters?
[32:48.58]These are wires, right?
[32:55.16]Oh, I have to complete item pack 10 to unlock.

[33:46.10]Stand up.
[33:47.81]Stay.
[33:48.49]No, stay.
[33:50.77]What tool?
[33:51.95]Electric pliers?
[33:55.05]Test pen.
[34:04.55]I can't like push it in there?
[34:07.39]Precision driver.
[34:10.59]No.
[34:14.15]Hex wrench, screwdriver, mannequin, gravity gun, rocket launcher, C4 grenade, classic assault rifle.
[34:25.07]uh x-ray glasses magnifying glass I need the tweezers I think shoot it I can't buy it gamer glasses it's the precision driver is it though
[34:56.56]Wait, I need like a tiny screwdriver.
[35:01.83]See what I mean?
[35:03.67]Will the screwdriver get that?
[35:30.91]Okay, how many parts are left, 24?
[35:34.93]Nothing, I gotta get it in here.
[35:37.45]I gotta get it in there.
[35:38.11]Okay, and the puncher?
[35:45.77]No, I need the puncher.
[35:57.32]What about, how,
[36:05.17]Whoa, what happened?
[36:09.87]God, that was like taking out an ingrown hair.
[36:11.69]That was, you know what?
[36:13.09]DLC.
[36:14.47]DLC, whoever made this game.
[36:16.58]Ingrown hair removal.
[36:20.42]Right?
[36:21.60]No?
[36:22.86]No.
[36:25.26]Yeah, like little tweezers and pull it out.
[36:26.91]Whatever, you guys don't get it.
[36:34.42]Uh, we got 21 more parts.
[36:35.66]They're all connected to here.
[36:36.56]Okay, the screwdriver again.
[36:58.72]This is kind of fun.
[36:59.72]You know, I'm getting like House Flipper vibes.
[37:05.28]Because you can't do this with stuff in your house.
[37:07.38]You won't work anymore.
[37:11.42]If you wanted to do this, you wouldn't be able to do it.
[37:15.77]Your mother would yell at you.
[37:17.95]This gives you an outlet.
[37:21.07]Okay, now just pull it apart.
[37:22.75]No?
[37:29.41]This is what it looks like inside.
[37:30.67]Ooh.
[37:38.14]Whoa!
[37:39.30]Whoa, that's the worm that's inside.
[37:40.82]That's the skeleton.
[37:42.82]This is what it looks like inside.
[37:44.08]Nice.
[37:49.82]Have we got four more?
[38:00.71]Six minutes for a lamp.
[38:05.89]Record time.
[38:07.80]Praise the sun.
[38:08.88]Alright, what's the next one?
[38:11.24]Speaker.
[38:11.94]What else do we have?
[38:14.62]A house.
[38:17.57]You have to take apart a house.
[38:20.31]With like a screwdriver.
[38:25.05]The Titanic?
[38:26.85]A screwdriver?
[38:29.75]A rice cooker?
[38:30.51]A car?
[38:33.90]An airplane?
[38:35.30]A toaster?
[38:38.09]A skyscraper!
[38:41.11]A tank!
[38:43.87]Oh, they... Okay, this is... They're not fucking around.
[38:46.97]You thought this game was like a little joke?
[38:49.11]Just wait till we get to the fucking plane, the car.
[38:53.33]We have to start small, though.
[38:55.01]I gotta work my way up.
[38:57.19]This is fun.
[39:00.60]It's basic.
[39:01.32]This is a real basic game.
[39:03.70]But...
[39:06.59]Honestly, this is what I would recommend for VR.
[39:08.41]Like your father or your grandfather.
[39:10.97]They love this shit.
[39:12.03]You know, they like to go into the garage and just like fucking put things together and take them apart and put it back together again.
[39:17.46]My grandfather took apart clocks and put the clocks back together.
[39:25.46]That's a lie.
[39:26.50]I don't know anyone that's ever done that.
[39:27.70]I think I actually stole that from like a Disney made-for-TV movie.
[39:31.60]I don't know where I'm getting that from.
[39:35.05]That happens in a movie, and it was like, pretending that was my grandfather.
[39:38.75]That's my pretend grandfather.
[39:39.91]Alright, here we go.
[39:40.53]Speaker.
[39:44.68]Had to do it once.
[39:46.16]No, go back, go back, go back.
[39:47.32]That was a waste of time.
[39:55.00]That was in Star Wars.
[40:00.92]Put some tunes on?
[40:03.93]I don't know.
[40:05.19]I don't know if I... I mean, the music in this game is like default music.
[40:10.07]What do we got?
[40:10.59]Q-R-S...
[40:24.94]If you go back and watch, somebody mentioned this, and we talked about it before the stream.
[40:29.48]Every single character does this with their hands during that.
[40:34.56]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.
[40:39.52]I didn't tweet the fight either, no.
[40:42.56]Alright.
[40:44.42]Let's go, what do we got?
[40:45.40]Speaker.
[40:45.82]It just feels cool to do this.
[40:56.45]How many parts?
[40:58.05]My father was, oh god.
[40:59.31]43 parts, this is a big one.
[41:11.35]I can't wait to get the power drill.
[41:14.42]That's for winners though.
[41:16.00]Okay, that's that.
[41:16.96]Let's put this down carefully.
[41:19.28]Ah.
[41:20.48]A lot of glare.
[41:26.45]This is what the inside of a speaker looks like.
[41:30.09]Interesting.
[41:30.65]Alright, how do I get that?
[41:32.09]Dude, what?
[41:34.39]I thought it was full of liquid.
[41:37.67]I thought it was kinetic liquid.
[41:43.91]Alright, no more of those.
[41:45.81]So that's that.
[41:46.73]Let's turn it back around.
[41:48.21]Ooh.
[41:55.54]Okay.
[42:01.76]Ah, I got to take those out.
[42:04.78]Have we done the base?
[42:06.76]Can I?
[42:09.10]Dude, alright.
[42:09.92]No!
[42:11.80]Nothing else here, I don't think, because it's just the charcoal.
[42:17.49]Wow, that's it, huh?
[42:19.55]Oops, well, I need that.
[42:28.95]Don't make a mess.
[42:32.00]Is this just one part, or can I pull this apart completely?
[42:41.14]I think this is just one piece.
[42:43.76]This, on the other hand, I've got to work with.
[42:50.13]What have we got left?
[42:50.83]20 parts.
[42:58.41]Raspberry Pi.
[43:01.02]Do I have to get in there and take all those off?
[43:03.68]What about the wires?
[43:05.14]There's 13 more parts.
[43:14.25]Fuck.
[43:15.97]Where are the other 13 parts?
[43:17.17]I need to get tool pliers right.
[43:22.03]No.
[43:31.65]How do I get these out?
[43:33.95]These... No.
[43:34.83]Are you serious?
[43:47.58]I get to get them with a crowbar?
[43:53.10]No, that's not right.
[43:54.08]Maybe I can't... Shouldn't I be...
[44:04.26]Wait, no.
[44:05.04]How do I get this out?
[44:05.83]Just a regular screwdriver?
[44:15.11]No.
[44:19.93]What?
[44:22.09]Flip the table.
[44:24.37]I can't.
[44:24.71]I'm not strong enough.
[44:29.55]I don't have the C4 unlocked yet.
[44:31.29]How do I get this?
[44:31.81]Do I just have to grab it from this side?
[44:33.89]No.
[44:34.17]Tool required.
[44:34.92]None of these worked.
[44:42.92]Hmm.
[44:45.84]You'd think it would be pliers.
[44:48.08]Apparently not.
[44:51.75]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[44:52.93]But look.
[44:54.51]Tool.
[44:54.83]I don't think I can do that.
[45:00.33]Try to take the... Well, I know these probably have some stuff in them, like this right here, right?
[45:06.53]This is going to be tricky.
[45:12.17]God, I'm a fucking dentist.
[45:18.21]Dentist game.
[45:19.11]Dentist DLC.
[45:21.47]You can, like, pull teeth out and stuff and, like, correct.
[45:25.13]You got the... You already have the engine here, man.
[45:35.33]How do I do that on the other one?
[45:37.98]I don't even know what I'm pulling out.
[45:40.30]Okay.
[45:42.48]These, I need to get that out, right?
[45:46.00]Apparently not.
[45:46.66]I don't get it.
[45:54.18]Still 10 pieces.
[46:02.52]These, the other pliers, they're unlocked.
[46:05.40]I can't even, I have to beat item pack four to get these.
[46:24.50]Why is that person here?
[46:34.41]Hmm, nothing.
[46:40.50]This is the wires that fell from down here.
[46:42.16]I can't go out the window without guys.
[46:56.90]Can you use the path?
[46:58.10]Yeah, the park finder, maybe.
[46:59.42]That's probably not a bad idea.
[47:16.32]Is it right here?
[47:17.42]Hold on, like... Is it this thing?
[47:45.93]What?
[47:52.41]Oh no, he's crawling for her tombstone!
[48:00.25]So what is this thing?
[48:01.41]Is it?
[48:01.63]Alright, so, I don't get, what the hell is in here?
[48:12.43]Ah, look at that, okay.
[48:20.76]Six, one.
[48:24.20]Two, three, four.
[48:28.94]Alright, three now.
[48:30.20]It's this stupid thing right here.
[48:31.48]This is one, two.
[48:32.32]Alright, give me this.
[48:33.88]Turn it on.
[48:49.23]How do I get you open?
[48:52.09]How do I get this open?
[49:00.52]Just take it out.
[49:01.56]Put it, I'm not gonna put it there.
[49:03.59]Test pen.
[49:06.07]Oh, I can delete that, that's good.
[49:10.33]Test pen.
[49:15.60]What, I tried that!
[49:22.87]There's one more part, what is it?
[49:35.58]Alright, open up.
[49:36.66]It's time for your cleaning.
[49:37.88]Boy hair?
[50:12.51]nine minutes not a big deal best time alright back to the main menu I was not expecting that sticker alright item pack one complete item pack two pocket knife microscope an antique car mmm
[50:41.36]This one's gonna be fun.
[50:45.96]Alright, 23 parts.
[50:50.00]Alright, alright, is it alive or what?
[51:07.51]Okay, let's see if I can identify all these.
[51:11.28]so we have wait there's one more see if I can identify everything so we've got baby scissors to cut literally nothing because there's no reason to have those they don't do anything they're just there for you to protect the on a swiss army knife that's there for you to pretend it's a monster and you could like make a voice my grandfather used to do that
[51:35.70]Knife.
[51:36.90]That is dull enough for you to spread cream cheese on a bagel.
[51:40.06]So, I mean, not really that useful.
[51:43.02]Spring.
[51:43.42]Well, I don't know what you'd use a spring for.
[51:46.50]To, like, pretend to bounce it.
[51:47.97]What use does that have?
[51:50.01]Then you have, like, the Assassin's Creed assassin dagger.
[51:53.47]You know, you'd like to... Here is your can opener, which is pretty useful if you're camping.
[51:59.58]There's the fish knife to fillet the fish.
[52:03.82]And then here is the hind leg to prop it up like a bike.
[52:09.49]Oh, and the keychain.
[52:10.87]So, there you go.
[52:11.77]That's pretty much how this works.
[52:18.81]Is he talking shit about Swiss Army Knives?
[52:20.59]No!
[52:20.85]Look at how useful this is!
[52:24.97]That's useful.
[52:26.07]That's useful.
[52:27.07]That's useful.
[52:28.37]That's useful.
[52:29.44]Not useful.
[52:30.94]Don't- Not useful.
[52:33.73]That's useful.
[52:34.53]So, alright, so like 75% of this is useful, the rest is just there for fun.
[52:50.14]Fucking grab it!
[52:52.36]Scissors are dead weight.
[52:53.63]Alright, I don't like that noise.
[52:55.85]You know, replace the scissors with...
[52:58.55]Okay, you wanna know how you make that cool?
[53:00.51]Instead of scissors, have it pull up a little roll, a little mini roll of tape.
[53:04.59]Like scotch tape.
[53:05.80]Even if it was like two slabs.
[53:14.48]How is that useful?
[53:20.29]You do the math!
[53:38.43]I gotta get this one off.
[53:47.91]Whoa.
[53:51.44]Get out- get out of here.
[53:56.18]That's how it- that's it?
[53:59.10]Oh, these are all gonna fall now.
[54:01.90]Cool.
[54:05.47]There's the spring.
[54:09.92]I want everyone in chat to be real with me here.
[54:11.84]What is this?
[54:12.72]What do you use this for?
[54:16.70]What is this for?
[54:17.58]It's a corkscrew?
[54:19.84]But for what?
[54:20.78]For wine?
[54:22.04]Why is half this shit to open bottle of alcohol?
[54:26.18]What do you do with this?
[54:29.98]Is this essential to survival?
[54:31.62]To like open a wine bottle?
[54:36.16]No, replace this with like, PEZ.
[54:38.74]Have like three PEZ here instead of this.
[54:50.93]See, let me show you a use for this thing.
[54:52.89]Ready?
[54:53.13]Like, hey, it's me.
[54:56.33]I'm a skimmy monster.
[54:57.73]That's what my fucking grandfather did in the middle of his spare time when he was building and taking apart clocks.
[55:04.97]What is this?
[55:05.41]Oh, the shaver.
[55:06.62]That's useful.
[55:19.31]Look at this.
[55:19.71]Look at the precision here.
[55:35.71]Four more parts.
[55:37.45]On the back of this, maybe?
[55:42.59]What?
[55:43.05]Oh, right here?
[55:44.39]Ah, okay.
[55:45.01]Did somebody break it in?
[55:50.05]What?
[55:50.73]Somebody just threw a baseball.
[55:52.55]Goddamn kids, that's why my study, I wanted to have it against the other side.
[55:56.67]Away from the neighbor's backyard.
[55:59.95]I'm taking apart shit and putting it back together.
[56:03.17]Fucking rotten little shits.
[56:06.90]We want to play baseball.
[56:08.72]Get out of here.
[56:09.37]Get away from me.
[56:20.23]Shit.
[56:20.85]Where did it go?
[56:50.97]No?
[56:51.25]God damn it, where is it?
[57:15.00]Does anybody see it?
[57:27.48]God damn it, that's the second ball this week.
[57:33.20]Hello?
[57:38.26]Yes, this is the police.
[57:40.84]I've got a few rotten kids that have been hitting baseballs into my window.
[57:46.13]Yeah.
[57:48.23]Thank you.
[57:49.19]Send two squad cars.
[57:51.93]It looks like they're having a good time out there.
[57:55.85]End it.
[58:02.61]Put him away!
[58:04.69]Okay, give me this back.
[58:11.34]It's this thing right here.
[58:12.24]Just shut it up.
[58:39.91]I can't move.
[59:18.49]Now this is, oh, this is gonna be fun finding this part.
[59:23.45]This is gonna take like $400 million and like the entire state of Washington to find this.
[59:32.20]Oh, God damn it.
[59:38.70]Just reset.
[59:39.72]What?
[59:40.10]No, I'm already done.
[59:41.10]Hold on.
[59:43.12]Anybody see it?
[59:47.09]Where is it?
[59:54.71]It's apparently right in front of my face.
[60:01.60]It's snorkeling in my own house.
[60:04.10]Is it still forward?
[60:06.02]Wait, did you see it?
[60:06.82]I think I saw it.
[60:28.43]What?
[60:35.00]God damn it.
[60:40.06]Wait, what do you mean?
[61:15.47]Nice.
[61:19.57]Very good.
[61:20.39]Very good.
[61:25.25]Main menu.
[61:25.61]Alright, we got a microscope and an antique car.
[61:40.27]This one's probably going to be a lot.
[61:42.15]This is 43 parts.
[61:44.37]How are we going to get a car in here?
[61:46.91]Oh, Jesus.
[61:47.69]Okay, well.
[61:50.23]Wait, can I look in it first?
[61:53.68]Don't lose anything.
[61:59.36]Oh, wait, you guys can't see that.
[62:00.30]Now you can.
[62:03.90]I'm putting my hand under here.
[62:04.82]You can't see anything?
[62:06.63]Oh, well.
[62:08.60]I'm probably going to take those apart.
[62:09.80]Okay.
[62:20.95]No, no.
[62:22.61]Okay.
[62:23.71]Going good.
[62:27.98]Some of these might have to be completely taken apart.
[62:39.30]Oops.
[62:45.99]This game's really cool, but I'll tell you, being able just to go like this means somebody didn't put this together correctly.
[62:53.35]They didn't use any glue, tape, screws.
[62:58.49]They just jenged this thing together.
[63:03.68]Whoa.
[63:07.10]Why is there, like, smoke here?
[63:12.53]Oh, turn it off.
[63:22.41]Rotten motherfuckers.
[63:31.96]Yeah, it's me again.
[63:36.60]I don't know, somebody's driving by and going loud and honking and shit.
[63:44.62]Yes.
[63:48.22]Yes, I'm aware, but I'm a part of my neighborhood watch.
[63:51.76]I might, yes.
[63:53.41]Yes, I know I call six times a week.
[63:58.25]You've already dealt with it.
[64:00.55]But you haven't.
[64:04.03]I'm a preferred member of my community.
[64:10.65]Give me my other phone, I got two cell phones for this reason.
[64:14.32]Hey!
[64:15.68]No, no, it's going to be forever.
[64:20.58]No, it's not.
[64:20.93]Okay, they're both off, right?
[64:29.17]Oh, we got them two wild and crazy guys.
[64:32.29]Oh, my God, I'm going to break something.
[64:39.80]Oh, who cares?
[64:40.20]It's not going to turn on.
[64:41.02]Get me back down here.
[64:47.44]Anywhere on the cell phone!
[64:49.28]Oh no!
[64:50.82]Charlie!
[64:52.04]Charlie!
[64:52.54]Oh, this is ridiculous, Charlie!
[64:57.28]Oh, more of the fan!
[64:59.00]Wait!
[65:00.65]Wait, Charlie!
[65:03.97]Charlie!
[65:05.87]Charlie, work!
[65:08.77]Charlie, it's working!
[65:11.35]Charlie!
[65:12.92]Get me down!
[65:23.98]Why is it so complicated to move?
[65:27.55]Jesus Christ.
[65:29.79]Oh no, it's not going to stop.
[65:31.19]I've got to do this quick.
[65:34.02]How many parts are left?
[65:36.00]25.
[65:37.76]Okay, it's silent now.
[66:14.54]It's stuck under this one!
[66:16.33]Charlie!
[66:17.89]Drink it again, quick!
[66:52.98]Nice and quiet.
[67:00.87]That's the way I like it.
[67:04.35]That's the way I like it.
[67:11.01]Probably gonna need that later.
[67:11.89]There's the light.
[67:20.01]Very bright.
[67:20.51]How do I turn this off?
[67:30.40]Is that the... No, I just made it brighter.
[67:35.39]I want to turn this off.
[67:37.69]The light is so bright I can't even focus.
[67:39.57]Turn it around.
[67:40.05]Okay, any more parts here?
[67:42.29]Okay.
[67:46.05]Little ploppers.
[67:46.83]Okay, can I take the back off?
[67:55.18]You can, alright.
[67:59.56]I...
[68:00.50]Oh, my goodness.
[68:01.26]The whole thing comes off, right?
[68:02.30]Is there anything else in here?
[68:04.04]Because I kind of want to just get rid of this.
[68:09.13]I think this is just one big piece.
[68:12.93]So, get this away from me.
[68:15.25]Because the light is too much.
[68:16.27]Alright, what do we got?
[68:17.89]Fifteen parts.
[68:19.11]The little ones, right?
[68:22.52]Maybe this?
[68:23.06]Can I get inside here?
[68:27.58]No.
[68:29.44]No.
[68:33.17]Okay, there's that one.
[68:35.13]Done.
[68:42.29]Alright, couple more of these clickers.
[68:44.95]Click, no.
[68:46.45]Come on.
[68:52.54]Ooh.
[68:56.50]Ooh.
[68:58.30]Oh.
[69:01.90]How many more?
[69:03.61]Nine.
[69:04.05]No.
[69:08.11]Take these apart, maybe?
[69:10.75]The glass inside?
[69:11.67]No, here we go.
[69:22.78]Oof.
[69:25.06]Oof.
[69:27.72]Any more?
[69:28.48]How many more?
[69:29.96]Four!
[69:30.36]Where are they?
[69:37.47]Anything else on here that's two?
[69:39.41]Where are the last two?
[69:44.50]No.
[69:46.58]No.
[69:48.94]Not this, right?
[69:51.98]No.
[69:54.70]Hmm.
[70:01.61]I'm like eating my lip.
[70:04.43]I had it?
[70:17.42]It's one more part.
[70:18.26]Where is it?
[70:30.00]Where is it?
[70:37.65]Stop chewing on your lip.
[70:38.83]I'm like concentrating like.
[71:00.03]That's not it?
[71:02.65]Huh?
[71:06.17]Cute.
[71:08.81]Alright, I gotta drink some water.
[71:15.73]Let's back it up for a sec.
[71:23.44]Uh, this game's fucking fun.
[71:33.50]This is just relaxing.
[71:39.08]Alright.
[71:47.67]Clean the lens a little.
[71:49.01]My greasy face.
[71:49.87]There's like water in here.
[71:50.79]That's how disgusting I am as a human being.
[72:02.83]Alright.
[72:03.23]Let's get back in.
[72:07.15]Just want to get some water.
[72:09.05]Stay hydrated.
[72:13.95]Alright.
[72:18.83]Good to go.
[72:20.15]Car coming up.
[72:21.51]Old fashioned car.
[72:25.17]Antique car.
[72:28.61]Oh, wow.
[72:31.46]Oh, there's like a smudge on the lens.
[72:33.99]God damn it, hold on.
[72:40.53]That's gonna bother me.
[72:46.96]That's better.
[72:48.92]So I am supposed to take this thing apart with a wrench.
[72:54.22]Is that what I, what I understand here?
[72:55.57]There's 52 parts.
[73:16.71]No, no, get in the car!
[73:22.59]No, get back!
[73:24.93]Come here!
[73:32.67]How do I move reliably?
[73:35.67]Seriously?
[73:37.51]Okay.
[73:39.09]Well, that's a start.
[73:44.48]Does it still work?
[73:56.95]Hold on.
[74:01.79]I'm going to drive this thing around.
[74:23.54]Wait, you mean I could teleport this whole time?
[74:25.71]How the hell did I just do that?
[74:28.73]What?
[74:31.41]I could teleport this whole time?
[74:35.34]You mean I've been swimming around for no reason?
[74:38.76]Okay, here we go.
[74:39.32]Oh, what are you doing?
[74:48.07]What the fuck?
[74:54.28]The throttle is... How did I just do it before?
[75:01.93]Alright, the controls changed.
[75:04.19]I pressed the same button I pressed last time.
[75:10.07]I swear to God, I was pressing up.
[75:16.46]What happened?
[75:19.36]Use the D-pad?
[75:19.88]That's what I did last time.
[75:21.38]Now I'm teleporting.
[75:23.77]Okay, it's not that.
[75:24.67]Okay, it's not left and right.
[75:27.57]It's not up and down.
[75:29.05]This is now teleport.
[75:30.47]No!
[75:30.73]See, look!
[75:31.01]Look at this!
[75:32.27]On first li- on first li- Okay, slow down.
[75:51.12]Turn it, turn.
[75:57.01]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[76:09.38]Ah!
[76:09.46]It only works when it's highlighted.
[76:16.06]Ah!
[76:16.78]Alright, now let's actually do it.
[76:39.80]Alright, what is this?
[76:42.82]A headlight?
[76:46.42]Doesn't do anything?
[76:51.56]Engine!
[76:51.90]No, this is the air filter that brings in cool, clean air.
[76:58.62]That's how your air conditioning works.
[77:03.96]Make sure there's nothing else in here.
[77:04.96]Okay, this...
[77:11.55]Just want to show you guys how this shit works.
[77:20.90]Turn it on.
[77:23.92]Was that the engine?
[77:26.32]I can't turn the engine on now.
[77:31.75]Why?
[77:32.11]I'll do it.
[77:38.03]I was going to do it manually.
[77:52.25]Easy.
[77:57.85]What is that?
[77:58.31]Oh, this is the wing.
[78:04.61]What is this?
[78:05.09]Is it weight?
[78:13.63]Not that I don't have to take anything apart here, right?
[78:17.83]Okay.
[78:25.08]Another piece of glass.
[78:27.07]This is the second headlight.
[78:28.17]I don't think I'm going to do anything else with that.
[78:39.72]It's the wheels.
[78:40.44]I don't want to fuck with the wheels yet.
[78:43.44]Test it first.
[78:50.66]What?
[78:52.09]Okay, well, I was trying to punch through it.
[78:56.11]Spare wheel.
[78:56.67]Do I have to take the inside out as well?
[79:01.57]I do.
[79:02.79]They thought of everything, didn't they?
[79:05.41]They thought of everything, didn't they?
[79:08.09]Well, let's go ahead and get the tools out.
[79:09.65]We'll deal with that later.
[79:21.87]Put all the tires over here.
[79:25.29]This is the danger cone.
[79:30.95]Oh, this is this bike seat for somebody else in the back.
[79:35.09]What's in here?
[79:42.06]You are very strong in this game.
[79:46.44]I'm going to have to take a look at that later.
[79:52.67]What is this?
[79:53.19]This is the... At least I can just pick these up.
[79:56.47]This is the... I don't even know if that was holding up that thing.
[79:59.35]Alright, here's the other wing.
[80:01.27]Oh shit, I have to take it off that wing.
[80:07.42]Wow, this car is... These things are really basic, huh?
[80:18.16]Get... That would have just hit me right in the mouth and knocked all of my teeth out.
[80:22.84]Alright, this is the back.
[80:23.68]Let's go like this.
[80:29.40]Can I get this off?
[80:30.94]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[80:31.58]Don't do that yet.
[80:33.39]This thing's gonna freak the fuck out and flip over.
[80:36.73]What's going on?
[80:44.21]What's that?
[80:44.51]Okay.
[80:48.67]That was weird.
[80:49.19]Okay.
[80:51.75]Oh, shit.
[80:56.07]Alright, I gotta get some weight distribution.
[80:58.07]The whole thing is gonna come down.
[81:06.34]Can I take this?
[81:06.92]Alright, this is gonna, the whole car will fall.
[81:10.14]Not yet.
[81:11.06]I'm gonna get the doors and the other crap that's over here.
[81:17.48]Now I need a tool.
[81:18.30]Can I open this?
[81:27.06]I'm just like breaking these things.
[81:28.44]Alright, that's fine.
[81:32.56]Take the top off.
[81:35.64]That leaves us with the engine.
[81:37.62]Now.
[81:45.27]Get the doors off.
[81:47.35]How much more parts?
[81:49.77]27.
[81:53.13]Use the hammer.
[81:53.85]I don't have access to the hammer.
[81:56.38]I haven't unlocked the hammer.
[81:57.50]I have like a bunch of tools I still need to unlock.
[82:16.17]I can't take this off yet.
[82:17.17]It's because it's buried in here.
[82:18.83]Alright, hold on.
[82:20.19]Can I take off the roof?
[82:22.13]Okay, I can get the roof.
[82:31.82]Alright, starting to look a little skeleton here.
[82:35.34]Get the seat out.
[82:41.30]Alright, now, let me get the tire.
[82:51.67]How do I get this off?
[82:56.73]I can't, like, rip this off?
[83:04.20]Maybe I don't have the right tool for this?
[83:08.90]Just pop the tire.
[83:14.72]How the fuck do I get this off?
[83:17.42]How do I get this off?
[83:19.64]Behind you.
[83:20.96]Don't even say that.
[83:26.17]Use the wrench?
[83:35.90]Okay.
[83:38.06]Oh shit, okay.
[83:40.20]We're almost, how many more parts?
[83:41.58]22, not even close.
[83:43.31]Oh god.
[83:47.91]No, no, stop hitting the wall.
[84:16.78]Yes!
[84:19.35]My plan worked!
[84:21.27]Who needs a wrench?
[84:46.43]There we go.
[84:47.93]How many parts?
[84:49.93]15.
[85:05.50]There's the engine.
[85:06.36]Get that over there.
[85:07.06]There's this part.
[85:10.26]Okay.
[85:11.34]Can't get that off yet.
[85:18.66]Can I hit the wheel?
[85:21.43]Yep.
[85:22.59]Oh, yes.
[85:23.89]This is where it all just falls apart.
[85:25.37]You just look at it.
[85:25.87]It's just so tender it falls off the bone.
[85:28.25]Look at that.
[85:29.39]Look at that.
[85:30.65]All it took was 12 minutes in the new wave oven.
[85:34.13]And it's just so, the bone, the meat just is, do you see that?
[85:37.43]Take a look at this.
[85:51.09]Watch out, though, because it can fucking spray up on you.
[86:04.72]Alright.
[86:06.44]There's still things I need to do here.
[86:11.87]Shit, is it the engine?
[86:20.70]Nothing else on the engine?
[86:22.08]Uh-oh.
[86:30.18]I need to get the part thing out.
[86:33.04]Oh, it's the wheels.
[86:34.76]The wheels, right?
[86:50.13]The wheels, these things, look, the metal has to come out of them, right?
[86:56.54]Whoa, oh, never mind.
[87:10.29]Girl bar.
[87:17.52]Get out of there.
[87:18.54]What's left?
[87:19.08]It's the tires.
[87:19.68]He's done it again.
[87:50.40]How many more?
[87:50.90]Two more tires?
[87:51.54]Three more?
[87:51.88]Where's the other one?
[87:59.12]Right there?
[88:04.81]That's it?
[88:05.19]There's one more.
[88:08.11]Is there one more tire?
[88:08.97]Let's get a bird's eye view here.
[88:12.87]Tire.
[88:15.75]Tire.
[88:17.11]Tire.
[88:19.87]Shit.
[88:37.44]Hmm.
[88:38.78]Over here?
[88:46.08]Whoa!
[88:56.24]Hmm.
[89:15.69]It's this.
[89:19.08]What do you mean, this?
[89:20.26]What is this?
[89:22.96]Hold on, let me... Oh!
[89:38.30]I got... 13 minutes.
[89:39.40]Classic bomb unlocked.
[89:43.54]I got a bomb.
[89:54.61]Robot safe bicycle robot.
[89:59.21]How big is it?
[90:00.33]Oh my god.
[90:05.96]I Was thinking was gonna be a little toy Well, they just gave it to us we have to see how it works right I
[90:19.45]Grip left, right.
[90:20.66]Okay.
[90:21.10]Grip either hand to use.
[90:22.58]Well, how do I, is it just lit right now?
[90:27.60]What determines how this explodes?
[90:35.87]Whoa.
[90:36.29]It goes into slow motion.
[90:39.05]Holy shit.
[90:42.47]Oh my God.
[90:43.49]Are you kidding me?
[90:45.86]Is this going to fly at me?
[90:46.94]What happens to slow motion last?
[90:52.40]Wow.
[90:57.46]It's still in slow motion.
[91:05.29]Can I touch it?
[91:05.91]It's still in slow motion.
[91:12.05]It's super hot.
[91:14.05]Super hot.
[91:16.53]I think I can hold on.
[91:21.16]Movement speed.
[91:23.09]interface, graphics quality, bomb slow motion speed.
[91:34.68]Should we just do like 80%, 60, 70%, 60, 58, whatever?
[91:39.65]We're still in slow motion.
[91:49.83]That's really cool, but you kind of have to sit here.
[91:51.67]How long does this last?
[92:01.35]clock on the main menu.
[92:02.63]Time.
[92:04.95]Is it done?
[92:10.71]Let's throw another one.
[92:20.16]Okay.
[92:20.54]How many of these can I
[92:39.17]This is crazy.
[92:43.29]Alright, let's start over.
[92:45.01]How many parts are there?
[92:45.71]There's only 24 parts.
[92:47.64]That's nothing.
[92:49.36]Maybe I can just do it all with this.
[92:51.98]Get it, get it, get it, get it, throw it.
[93:13.63]No!
[93:20.29]Eat this, scumbag!
[93:22.35]I think I did it.
[93:35.10]That's it!
[93:41.14]So, uh, I think...
[93:43.61]Using the bombs is cheating.
[93:46.07]Because you don't get a time.
[93:51.75]So.
[93:55.24]Though, that's just for fun.
[93:56.62]That doesn't count.
[93:59.82]Did it actually count, though?
[94:02.66]See?
[94:03.54]That didn't count.
[94:06.84]We gotta do it legit.

[95:17.61]shit let's get the head off anything else the head no what we need 21 more parts shoulders come off oh my god that's so cool
[95:47.04]No, no, no.
[95:47.86]How dare you?
[95:48.38]I was using this as a weapon.
[96:03.26]What?
[96:04.44]None of that came off?
[96:18.89]I don't know.
[96:19.53]This is like his other shoulder?
[96:22.55]Oh, Jesus.
[96:23.25]I have his whole body.
[96:24.63]Alright, we're going for a break up here.
[96:25.85]Fuck.
[96:33.42]I can't see.
[96:34.08]No, don't open the window!
[96:42.86]Oh, fuck.
[96:53.78]Give me this.
[96:58.26]This is what it's like to be Superman.
[97:04.92]I could go with some more sound effects besides... We got 16 more parts.
[97:09.13]It's like the little
[97:23.67]I don't even know.
[97:24.21]What the hell would it be?
[97:25.69]Here?
[97:27.41]Is this all one piece?
[97:32.83]I think that's all one piece.
[97:33.97]That's the torso.
[97:35.05]I don't think these come off.
[97:40.97]I don't think so.
[97:41.43]I think that's one piece.
[97:44.37]The arms, on the other hand.
[97:49.09]Yeah.
[98:00.74]Looking good.
[98:03.97]Any more pieces that are attached here?
[98:05.39]I think it's just the knuckle.
[98:09.21]Maybe the fingers.
[98:09.87]I think that's the way.
[98:13.31]Did these come off?
[98:15.31]No.
[98:18.74]Let's see if I can get the hand off.
[98:20.46]Yeah, of course.
[98:25.34]Yeah, the whole hand comes apart.
[98:31.49]That's that.
[98:39.34]Okay, get it on this one.
[98:40.40]How many more?
[98:41.84]Eight.
[98:42.04]I think that's it.
[98:52.43]Okay, six.
[98:55.79]What am I missing here?
[98:57.83]Maybe something with these.
[99:02.36]Oh, definitely.
[99:04.06]This, like, wheel comes off absolutely.
[99:08.86]The other arm?
[99:13.25]Up there, maybe?
[99:13.83]Yeah, I think that thing comes off.
[99:19.49]Gah!
[99:30.33]I'm getting too into it!
[99:31.72]I think I broke it.
[99:34.22]Are we good?
[99:39.86]We're good.
[99:43.40]I'm getting too immersed.
[99:49.67]How many more?
[99:50.45]Three pieces.
[99:57.39]There's only two more pieces!
[100:01.62]Where are they?
[100:04.22]Bring out the tool, you know the one.
[100:11.61]Straight ahead?
[100:22.69]Where was it?
[100:26.00]Oh shit, okay.
[100:28.64]It's this thing?
[100:36.61]Ah, alright.
[100:38.79]Then there's one more piece on the main body.
[100:45.55]This little piece?
[100:46.13]This little chest piece?
[100:48.33]No, where is it?
[100:49.05]I have no idea.
[100:57.70]Hmm.
[101:01.02]That's not it.
[101:16.66]Thank you.
[101:26.69]Dude, I've been biting my lip more.
[101:27.93]This is, I do this shit.
[101:30.58]I like, I just like chew on my mouth when I'm just concentrating on something that's interesting.
[101:38.68]When do I get, you get guns.
[101:46.40]Alright, so we got a crack of safe.
[101:51.07]What if I just know the code?
[101:53.11]Let's try a code.
[102:00.33]There's probably a code.
[102:04.76]Hmm.
[102:17.34]Hmm.
[102:17.80]Crack a safe.
[102:19.44]That's it.
[102:23.32]It's not... Let's just paint it on there.
[102:26.12]7331.
[102:28.14]I would probably advise against putting the code of your safe on the safe.
[102:33.29]Otherwise, somebody can just do that.
[102:36.47]Is it open?
[102:53.56]Gold bars in here.
[102:56.25]What is it?
[102:56.77]Gold.
[102:57.15]$999.
[102:57.93]One kilogram.
[102:58.31]This is like 50 grand.
[102:59.45]A kilogram of gold is like $50,000 to $60,000.
[103:03.69]Is it not?
[103:08.07]Alright.
[103:18.63]Okay.
[103:20.13]I got the gold.
[103:22.53]Wait, that's it.
[103:23.01]Oh, no, it's not.
[103:29.35]Can I get out now?
[103:36.22]Am I locked in forever?
[103:44.42]I took... Alright, I got a piece out.
[104:00.50]Alright, let's see systematically how we take this out.
[104:03.97]There's a lot of parts, apparently.
[104:06.71]Yeah!
[104:12.83]Alright, I've ripped it off.
[104:18.49]Can I get the sides?
[104:25.04]What about the top?
[104:30.83]39 parts, 39?
[104:36.02]How much more is in here?
[104:41.66]Flip this around maybe.
[104:59.15]Oh, Jesus.
[105:00.05]Alright, well, oh, goddammit, I hate my rooms!
[105:08.38]I'm gonna, like, rent out an ice skating rink and pave over it and have it be my personal VR room.
[105:19.59]Where do I put this?
[105:24.53]Hole in the wall.
[105:29.04]alright so now I get to this is where all the parts come from let's go ahead and get something some finesse here let's go to the wrench take out all the slugs nice
[106:01.08]There that goes.
[106:04.90]Is it still plugged in?
[106:12.51]They're disappearing.

[106:45.09]Can somebody tell me if he's popular?

[110:48.18]I used to take my candy bars and like grind them so I'd have like chocolate wheels.
[110:58.24]Somebody would just be there going, and you would just hold something there and like, like a sander.
[111:05.78]You won't put your face on it.
[111:07.14]You won't put your face on it.
[111:08.15]I'm gonna put my face on it, stupid.
[111:09.81]You know, I'll do it.
[111:11.89]And then they like kept like a fat lip for the next like three, four days.
[111:14.39]Nobody did that?
[111:27.81]Nobody, like, did this and then put their face on it.
[111:29.91]Don't do that.
[111:30.35]It's a bad thing.
[111:32.60]Alright, let's take this part.
[111:36.42]Now I want to stand it back up again.
[111:38.52]Nobody.
[111:39.02]Nobody.
[111:41.36]No, I'm talking, look.
[111:43.54]I'm talking about setting it up like this and spinning this and, like, going like this and one of your weirdo neighborhood friends does that and, like, it was a dumb thing to do and you should never do it.
[111:55.41]I do not condone it.

[113:17.31]Come on!
[113:27.59]Thank you.
[113:33.78]No, that's not it.
[113:35.82]Except for that one.

[113:38.81]Let's get back in.
[113:42.09]Oh, let me take this off because I don't want to have like a drink of water.

[114:19.38]Is this the right side?
[114:23.52]Yes, it is.
[114:26.32]Alright, hold on.
[114:30.56]Ceiling?
[114:35.32]I have to tape bells to the door.
[114:36.92]That's fucking hilarious.
[114:46.68]Oh, come on.
[114:47.08]Why is it... There's like a stain on here now.
[114:54.66]Fucking bird box?
[114:58.99]Turn on music.
[114:59.95]I'm going to have to take a... Let me take my first break.
[115:03.61]Let me go refill my water.
[115:05.57]And I'll come back.
[115:06.01]We'll put it on like a playlist or something.
[115:07.80]I'll be right back.
[118:33.97]Okay.
[118:35.73]Hello.
[118:37.74]Let's go back in this and take apart a bike.
[118:44.60]I'm going to sip my fresh water.
[118:51.11]She's not in there.
[118:53.39]Alright, let's get a, let's get like a, I don't know, like a Monster Rancher.
[118:57.85]Somebody's Monster Rancher 2 OST.
[118:59.37]Hopefully I can actually play through these speakers.
[119:09.18]um Monster Rancher 2 OST I think it's like eight minutes put on doom again how how it's made how it's made theme song for one hour
[119:41.43]No, no, how it's made background music.
[119:52.21]Hold on.
[119:53.09]How loud is this going to be in my headset?
[119:58.62]This is an hour long.
[119:59.72]This is going to drive me insane.
[120:05.06]How it's unmade.
[120:10.06]Then he takes the wrench and moves it down over the hole.
[120:20.97]Two workers come out and hold either side of the glass.
[120:28.01]An assembly line and hard workers.
[120:31.97]That's what it takes to undo a bicycle.
[120:35.43]Two tires are replaced
[120:39.31]with air-filled tires.
[120:48.53]This is so loud, though.
[120:49.79]Hold on.
[120:58.46]This is too... This is too... The OST is banger.
[121:11.18]I love this show too.
[121:12.32]I'm not shitting on it.
[121:13.32]That show's amazing.
[121:17.81]Okay, how do I get this to play softer in my ears?
[121:22.40]Probably like that.
[121:24.08]Yeah.
[121:26.02]Okay, here we go.
[122:03.30]Where are my hands?
[122:10.77]The person grabs the bike with their bare hands.
[122:15.37]A skilled worker undoes the handlebars with an Allen wrench.
[122:27.58]Two workers then hold the bike upside down
[122:31.40]And a third worker presses his face into the tire to make sure for a perfect face burn.
[122:39.64]Smith!
[123:17.33]Did we get, like, framed right here?
[123:19.09]What's going on with this?
[123:36.98]God damn it!
[124:23.10]I get it.
[124:27.41]Is it getting faster?
[124:28.83]I feel like it's getting pitched up.
[124:50.01]What?
[124:50.39]My game is breaking.
[124:58.63]bike!
[125:30.03]Pick it up.
[125:37.41]Other side.
[126:02.61]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[126:03.55]This song is gonna fucking drive me crazy.
[126:18.76]It is getting faster.
[126:21.46]The pitch is going up.
[126:31.36]What?
[126:47.64]That could happen.
[127:19.19]Alright, I'm almost done.
[128:07.89]No way!
[128:21.15]Almost got it!
[128:22.53]Get it!
[128:23.05]Take it off!
[128:50.96]Is it over?
[128:57.20]Of course not.
[129:00.52]I got it!
[129:01.98]I got it!
[129:05.96]I got it!
[129:34.39]Alright, get that out.
[129:42.47]Yeah.
[129:58.44]Why?
[129:58.72]How many more pieces? 45.
[130:53.72]That was like to the beat!
[131:02.50]Stop the music!
[131:03.40]Alright, I'm... I can't take that anymore.
[131:26.66]it's too much uranium is a metallic element that was discovered by a Jerma chemist in 1789 the significance of this discovery wasn't understood for a century and a half in 1938 scientists figured out that uranium atoms could be split to produce energy
[131:57.70]The size of a fireplace log, this nuclear fuel bundle generates a lot more heat.
[132:03.42]It's packed with enough uranium to power 100 homes for a year.
[132:09.38]To obtain the uranium, they tunnel 1640 feet underground at this site in northern Saskatchewan.
[132:16.64]This mine is the largest source of high-grade uranium in the world.
[132:22.14]The uranium ore lies beneath a bed of water-saturated sandstone.
[132:27.58]To reach it, they use drill bits studded with tungsten carbide buttons.
[132:32.16]Like knuckles on a fist, the button bits punch into the rock face.
[132:38.65]These first holes are for pipes that will pull heat out of the ground and freeze it around the ore.
[132:46.35]The miner operates the equipment by remote control.
[132:49.94]It transfers a new piece of pipe to the end of the drill roughly every five feet to penetrate 426 feet into the sandstone bed.
[132:59.95]It takes up to eight days to install just one length of pipe.
[133:03.95]There are 200 of them.
[133:06.95]Workers configure the pipes so they surround the ore deposit.
[133:11.10]These freeze pipes will stabilize the ground and also turn high pressure groundwater to ice so it won't interfere with the actual mining.
[133:22.07]A freeze plant above ground chills calcium chloride brine to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit and sends it through the freeze pipes.
[133:31.36]The brine absorbs heat as it freezes the ground and loops back to be chilled.
[133:35.86]Alright, alright, I'm done.
[133:39.35]Above the uranium deposits... Let's get something relaxing for crying out loud.
[133:50.71]We're learning.
[133:52.37]Don't do that.
[133:52.93]We're learning.
[133:55.86]Listen to the farts and screams.
[133:57.80]No.
[133:59.18]No, no.
[133:59.84]I'm not doing that.
[134:02.36]I was learning.
[134:03.26]Well, you're not learning today.
[134:08.47]Earthbound OST?
[134:09.47]That's not bad.
[134:19.87]What?
[134:21.62]Okay, that's the first.
[134:32.27]Too loud.
[134:37.82]Okay.
[134:39.26]That's at a reasonable level.
[134:50.48]Earthbound.
[135:00.19]I gotta get this fucking bike disassembled.
[135:02.63]Oh my god.
[135:04.99]We got a house coming up too.
[135:07.03]We'll put on some heavy fucking metal when I- I'm gonna tear that house down with a sledgehammer.
[135:21.48]This is better, okay?
[135:22.90]This is relaxing, it's good.
[135:24.32]High quality sound.
[135:59.14]Screwdriver?
[136:00.10]Get it!
[136:00.50]What?
[136:00.74]Get it!
[136:01.52]Huh?
[136:01.76]I... Back to one, okay?
[136:29.20]Why does nothing work?
[136:33.78]What the fuck?
[136:40.44]Why?
[136:42.28]I've done every tool.
[137:19.51]Alright, that's good.

[144:42.38]We can't do it like that.
[144:43.38]It's illegal.
[144:43.94]It's against the law.
[144:45.64]It's against the laws of the video game.
[144:50.50]Scarily effective.
[144:55.50]No, I just...
[145:01.86]I just door-knocked the streamer memed myself.
[145:07.08]Jesus Christ.

[146:03.08]Let's do it smart.
[146:04.06]You know what I mean?
[146:06.14]Why fuck the whole thing up?
[146:19.97]God damn it.
[146:20.97]I did it again.
[146:21.79]I did it again.
[146:22.49]I did it again.
[146:23.13]I did it again.
[146:31.86]Let's move out of the way for a minute.
[146:38.34]Where am I?
[146:41.05]Where am I?
[146:46.85]He's going mental.
[146:47.73]I got a booger inside my nose and I can't get it.
[146:51.23]You know, seriously, like Valve or HTC, cut this up a little bit so I can put my hand in my nose.
[146:56.91]I can't do it right now.
[147:02.67]Am I in a decent spot?
[147:04.63]I think.
[147:06.51]Alright.
[147:07.60]Keep it going.
[147:10.78]This is the way you're supposed to do this shit.
[147:18.64]Alright, you ready?
[147:24.53]Check it out.
[147:27.41]Wrong tool.
[147:29.63]Wrong tool.
[147:32.39]He's just, he's just surgical with this.
[147:42.48]Turn him around.
[147:45.76]You got a good sear on one side.
[147:48.31]You don't want to cook them too long.
[147:49.49]If you cook them too long, you want to go to medium well.
[147:51.63]You don't want to go over medium well.
[147:57.33]I think these are done.
[148:28.05]Come to me!
[148:30.57]What do we got?
[148:37.85]What's next?
[148:38.55]Looks like this guy right here.
[148:40.01]This is the spring.
[148:41.45]Nothing in there.
[148:45.75]There goes the spring!
[148:46.81]Alright, easy.
[148:54.80]Alright, hold on.
[148:56.48]Can take that out.
[149:05.02]Nothing else on this side?
[149:06.32]Are you sure?
[149:17.72]Get the other side, too.
[149:29.85]Oh, shit.
[149:30.45]Okay, that worked.
[149:36.55]I'm not going to take apart a whole house.
[149:39.47]That's going to be impossible.
[149:44.95]Oh, shit.
[149:45.57]OK.
[149:45.65]We got it.
[149:55.89]Good.
[149:57.50]Great.
[150:01.68]Get the paper out of here.
[150:06.83]Alright, what's next?
[150:08.66]These?
[150:10.34]I really gotta get under here, don't I?
[150:15.56]Look at this shit.
[150:18.58]Nope.
[150:22.73]One arm.
[150:28.33]This whole thing's gonna hit me in the head, isn't it?
[150:30.73]This is some America's Funniest Home Videos shit.
[150:43.21]Okay.
[150:44.15]What's left?
[150:45.23]Only so- I'm getting good at this!
[150:46.83]Is this still connected by something?
[150:49.79]What is it connected by?
[150:58.45]What is this connected to?
[151:00.91]Crowbar?
[151:02.11]I don't see anything it's connected to.
[151:28.91]Give me the fliers.
[151:36.77]There it goes.
[151:38.51]Alright, what do we got here?
[151:39.37]This should come off cleanly now.
[151:42.53]Got it.
[151:44.30]The bike took a long time.
[151:47.74]I don't know why.
[151:52.49]Well, I'm hyping myself up.
[151:56.71]We got one more and then we have the house to do.
[152:00.47]So, I gotta be ready.
[152:01.91]I gotta do my stretches.
[152:05.69]What we got?
[152:09.88]Water heater and then house.
[152:14.26]Does it work?
[152:20.92]Can I actually turn it on?
[152:42.15]Oh fuck!
[152:42.85]You might as well take care of this first.
[153:07.11]Alright, how do I get the panel off?
[153:08.69]Just with my hands?
[153:09.55]No no no no, I didn't want this.
[153:16.87]I don't want this.
[153:17.94]Oh my god, why?
[153:54.26]Just stay over there, I don't... Alright, turn this off.
[154:00.16]Thank you.
[154:01.44]How do I get the panel off?
[154:10.97]Shut up over there, will ya?
[154:17.66]Can I kind of wedge the panel off?
[154:29.20]I don't know how to get this off.
[154:38.63]No, no gun, no gun.
[154:41.77]Aw, look at that.
[154:45.69]Right there.
[155:11.57]There we go, there we go.
[155:13.05]Yeah, this is cool.
[155:13.71]Alright, leave that there for now.
[155:15.07]So this is what a water pump looks like.
[155:20.91]Hold on, can I turn it on?
[155:22.05]I wanna see where the water comes from.
[155:30.32]Just press this button.
[155:37.02]I can see right here.
[155:42.22]Cool.
[155:42.66]There's the circuit breaker.
[155:52.11]Such precision.
[156:03.63]Just get all the screws out.
[156:22.15]Tool, okay, I got that.
[156:23.23]Hold on, anymore?
[156:24.29]Right here?
[156:32.44]I can take it off a wall.
[156:33.80]Oh, fuck, you're right.
[156:36.72]Look at you, look at how smart you are.
[156:39.17]Uh, actually, no, I don't think I can.
[156:44.51]I don't think I can do that right this second.
[156:51.81]Flyers?
[156:58.22]Really?
[157:01.40]It's right there!
[157:01.96]Alright, I'm going down here.
[157:04.40]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[157:33.70]I feel like this is the kind of shit that's on Sesame Street.
[157:40.97]With the song playing here.
[157:42.01]This is an episode.
[158:02.41]I gotta cut wires.
[158:03.87]What's that?
[158:09.27]A grill?
[158:09.75]A circuit board with an Xbox 360 heatsink?
[158:11.89]Look at these tiny little things.
[158:12.75]My goodness.
[158:13.17]It's so tiny!
[158:33.79]Oh my god, I gotta turn it around.
[158:36.99]Look down here, I gotta get the screwdriver out.
[158:48.68]What?
[158:52.24]Easy.
[158:58.70]Whoa, that's the reactor!
[159:00.40]That's the nuclear reactor!
[159:07.38]Whoa!
[159:08.60]Whoa!
[159:13.62]Are you kidding me?
[159:14.54]Look at this detail.
[159:18.68]How many more parts?
[159:20.38]40 still.
[159:22.32]Hmm.
[159:27.20]Pliers?
[159:35.16]I'm going to say pliers.
[159:40.04]No.
[159:41.14]Right there.
[159:44.86]Where's the other part?
[159:46.84]Alright, got it.
[159:48.40]There's the band.
[159:49.20]Come on.
[160:05.27]Come on!
[160:15.99]Very interesting.
[160:16.73]Okay, now I think I can get rid of this.
[160:20.79]Yep.
[160:27.92]Nothing holding this together?
[160:32.84]I feel like there's another thing getting held down here.
[160:43.20]Yes.
[160:44.56]Yes.
[160:49.12]Nothing in that one?
[160:50.08]This is where the water comes from.
[160:51.94]What is that?
[160:58.24]Is that a bug?
[160:59.46]What is this?
[161:05.84]Oh.
[161:06.00]That was weird.
[161:24.83]What tool do I need to get that off?
[161:33.75]You'd think it was pliers.
[161:35.77]Is it not pliers?
[161:40.88]Time to fight!
[161:42.54]Oh shit!
[161:43.60]Missed!
[161:44.18]Minus 20 HP!
[161:56.65]Hector uses PK Dart.
[162:00.33]Not effective.
[162:06.88]Oh, Hector uses Dart again.
[162:10.72]PK Dart.
[162:12.80]Very effective.
[162:13.58]He's almost dead.
[162:20.89]PK up.
[162:21.95]PK Dart.
[162:30.62]I don't know, PK... PK, call the police!
[162:38.68]Didn't work.
[162:40.74]PK, crowbar!
[162:44.41]That's a win.
[162:48.35]PK, PK, gun!
[162:51.67]PK, gun!
[162:54.75]No, no, no, that'll fuck this up.
[162:59.72]That'll- that'll- yeah.
[163:00.85]No, no, no.
[163:01.15]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[163:03.45]Stop distracting me!
[163:06.25]You're distracting me!
[163:07.47]Wait, am I looking the right way?
[163:13.31]It's this one.
[163:14.91]It's PK Dart.
[163:26.14]Sorry.
[163:27.00]He's lost it.
[163:28.60]He's lost his mind.
[163:32.29]Oh my god, I gotta get in so close.
[163:34.71]Look at this.
[163:35.49]What?
[163:35.89]Nice.
[164:12.16]just shake it out.
[164:16.00]Same deal over here.
[164:16.70]Give it a, uh, there it is.
[164:24.93]So then I can pick this up again, shake it out.
[164:28.37]Now what?
[164:32.45]I can't get this one off.
[164:44.04]How do I get this one up?
[164:48.40]How do I get this off?
[164:51.92]Ah, there's a screw there.
[165:03.41]Now I can get this all off.
[165:04.49]Bingo.
[165:06.11]Bingo.
[165:06.33]Done.
[165:14.95]Two more parts.
[165:16.13]There's so much shit on the ground.
[165:27.41]The button on the front?
[165:33.67]Oh, right, right here.
[165:47.26]Done!
[165:49.55]That was cool.
[165:50.09]There's a lot of little intricate parts.
[165:54.35]Alright.
[165:57.71]Uh... The time has come to see what the house is.
[166:00.63]And you know what that means?
[166:02.75]It's time to put on, like, the hardest fucking song I can find.
[166:12.70]But I want to bring the house down.
[166:16.35]What is like an extreme like blast your ear drums out song?
[166:25.15]Not the full house theme I'm thinking something different Through the fire and flames, this is pretty hard.
[166:41.09]Oh
[166:52.92]Just keep using this one.
[166:56.42]No, not this one.
[166:57.92]Fine.
[166:58.60]We're going to pull this back.
[166:59.92]I'm going to do DOOM OST 2016.
[167:03.51]Because, I mean, it's been a while.
[167:16.94]This is loud and fucking crazy.
[167:18.64]So, here we go.
[167:25.96]See you guys soon.
[167:28.04]I'm going to thrash the fuck around right now.
[167:31.76]Get ready.
[167:32.16]It's going to be loud.
[167:37.38]In his ravenous hatred, he found no peace.
[167:41.31]And with boiling blood, he scoured the Umbral Plains, seeking vengeance against the Dark Lords who had wronged him.
[167:54.59]of his sword.
[168:31.90]Give me a new
[169:22.75]You didn't even try to have this house in.
[169:26.73]They built an entire house without any cement, without any brick, without anything, nothing to hold it together.
[169:32.94]They just stuck it together like a house of cards.
[169:38.70]Yeah!
[170:01.97]The precision!
[170:11.88]What's left, huh?
[171:51.49]Get the fuck out of here!
[172:04.50]Get it off there!
[172:10.08]Get off!
[172:21.56]I can't.
[172:26.26]I can't.
[172:32.08]I don't think I can do it anymore.
[172:37.71]I really hurt myself here.
[172:39.83]I didn't really have any ibuprofen.
[173:08.34]I am the champion!
[173:27.66]No, no spill.
[173:36.55]I'm gonna go take... I'm gonna be right back.
[173:39.23]I just used like six days worth of energy.
[173:46.65]I'm gonna get my water refilled.
[173:54.11]That was fucking intense.
[173:55.79]Why would a house fall down that easily?
[173:58.91]This game is fucking mental.
[174:00.25]I love it.
[174:05.25]I'll be right back.
[176:18.82]Alright, hi.
[176:22.88]Let me, uh... I've gotta untangle this cord, it's kind of all over the place.
[176:32.42]Kim?
[176:32.70]Check Kim's downstairs.
[176:34.06]I just saw.
[176:34.92]Just said hello.
[176:36.88]Alright, let me untangle you.
[176:41.23]Is my hand okay?
[176:42.53]Uh, it's alright.
[176:44.67]It's a little red, but it'll be fine.
[176:51.20]The controller took the brunt of that blow.
[176:55.64]Are we undangled here?
[176:56.50]Kind of, yeah.
[177:04.05]Let's put this back in.
[177:04.85]Why do I have to destroy it?
[177:17.02]I need to moisturize.
[177:20.29]I could do more than that.
[177:20.93]I could shave tonight.
[177:27.73]The Titanic?
[177:28.67]That's going to take all day.
[177:34.67]What a fun game, though.
[177:35.43]Holy shit.
[177:36.11]I did not expect this to be this fun.
[177:37.31]I feel like this is kind of an overlooked VR gem, if I'm going to be honest with you.
[177:46.08]It looks pretty... I'd give it a solid...
[177:50.85]They give it a solid B plus right now.
[177:52.39]Alright, let's get back in.
[178:02.73]Thanks for being honest.
[178:05.29]Yeah, I can't pretend.
[178:08.09]You guys have seen me try.
[178:08.99]I'm not gonna give you bullshit.
[178:12.79]The game's a 79.
[178:13.39]I mean, well, it's a B plus.
[178:17.45]That's an 88.
[178:22.45]Oh, my head's going to fall.
[178:26.05]Stop wearing it like it's a fun hat.
[178:30.00]Okay.
[178:33.18]This is how greasy my head is right now.
[178:35.72]Is this the right?
[178:45.39]Let's get this back on.
[178:49.49]Use the neck strap.
[178:51.76]If there was such a thing.
[178:52.72]Alright.
[178:58.86]Just use your grease to moisturize.
[179:01.02]You want me to break out tomorrow?
[179:05.26]Here we go.
[179:06.20]Let's finish this one.
[179:09.04]No more doom.
[179:10.78]No more music.
[179:12.32]I gotta focus.
[179:14.25]Okay.
[179:21.14]Get this in there.
[179:23.54]Get that in there.
[179:24.26]I've been playing this game for three hours, holy shit.
[179:28.41]It's been worth it, it's been fun.
[179:30.87]Alright, what's the final count here?
[179:37.15]This is 27 more parts.
[179:40.47]How the fuck am I gonna find that?
[179:44.46]I mean, like this, does this count?
[179:51.33]What?
[179:51.57]Am I frozen?
[179:53.93]Am I frozen in time?
[180:00.07]Is this like a Quicksilver moment?
[180:03.13]Should I run around and feed the dog pizza?
[180:04.91]I think it's the foundation.
[180:10.53]It's down here.
[180:15.40]If I could have
[180:23.30]I have to slide it all the way down?
[180:52.42]It's all the windows.
[180:56.88]Let's check.
[180:57.72]Twelve.
[180:59.86]And I didn't even use a gun.
[181:02.54]You understand?
[181:03.95]I didn't even use a gun.
[181:06.71]I did this all with my bare hands.
[181:08.51]And a little help from one of my friends, you know?
[181:10.83]A little help from a couple of my friends.
[181:19.78]Ah, okay.
[181:21.12]Nine.
[181:22.56]Well, this is eight.
[181:24.68]Seven.
[181:25.11]Seven, six.
[181:37.11]Something's gonna be buried underneath.
[181:39.56]Oh boy, this is bad.
[181:40.72]I need the tool.
[181:53.51]Oh god, right here.
[181:58.29]Right here.
[182:06.05]Four more parts.
[182:07.77]And I did it with my bare hands.
[182:12.77]Right here.
[182:13.58]This is where the stove was.
[182:24.66]Right here.
[182:28.94]I'm surprised that this is not dropping down to like 10 frames a second.
[182:34.88]Even in a game that has this much physics and shit in it, random pieces, wouldn't you expect this to be running at 10 frames a second right now?
[182:45.23]Two more, so one.
[182:46.11]That's it.
[182:49.37]One more, where is it?
[182:57.66]Is it the thing in the sky?
[182:58.60]I think it's the thing floating in the sky right here, but can I not grab it?
[183:18.15]That time is inflated because I had to take a break.
[183:21.25]How is this done?
[183:25.25]Okay, I want to...
[183:27.34]I just want to go inside the house if I can.
[183:30.08]We need to go inside.
[183:31.20]That's too interesting to not just look at at least once.
[183:34.44]Alright, here we go.
[183:35.12]Let's like walk in.
[183:35.72]Alright, it's an actual house.
[183:59.73]Honey, as you can see.
[184:01.39]No, no, no, back it up, back it up.
[184:04.04]Realtor.
[184:04.60]Realtor bit.
[184:05.16]Here we go.
[184:05.50]Three, two.
[184:08.48]So, as you see, property is very, very well maintained.
[184:11.58]Very well taken care of.
[184:12.96]Sort of has that colonial vibe to it.
[184:15.40]A little bit of a step up because the foundation happens here.
[184:17.97]The foundation goes up a little bit.
[184:19.89]You get your second floor, which is your master.
[184:22.71]Your master and your master bathroom is up there.
[184:26.43]and in here we've got the bathroom a little kids playroom over here as you can see pretty uh you know that's standard carpet not that you can take it up if you want this is all marble by the way a little walk-in closet for uh you know for you guys to store your jackets and in here this is one of my favorite parts of the house in here is the back drop out to the backyard
[184:51.50]Yeah, you don't have a huge backyard, but look, you've got a place for a grill and entertaining and having your friends come over.
[184:58.66]Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
[184:59.64]You want to see upstairs?
[185:01.18]Yeah, we can see upstairs.
[185:03.62]It's a big house.
[185:07.17]Yeah, let's take a look up here, as you see.
[185:08.47]Neighborhood's great.
[185:11.03]Schools are great.
[185:13.73]Watch your step, though.
[185:14.27]It's a little slippery, but it's just clean.
[185:17.71]Yeah.
[185:19.25]Really?
[185:19.61]Wow.
[185:20.23]Wow.
[185:22.36]I'm surprised they have that work here.
[185:26.56]That's a great job.
[185:28.30]Balcony out here, as you see.
[185:31.10]Beautiful, beautiful landscape out here in front of you.
[185:34.62]You've got a lot of plot of land, and this is not owned by anything.
[185:37.99]You can take your dog and your kid out there, and your kids can all just run around out there.
[185:41.87]You can get a whole baseball team out there.
[185:46.93]Yeah, so price, right?
[185:48.65]We were talking about price.
[185:50.55]As you know, property like this is not necessarily cheap.
[185:54.93]We are in, like I said, a very beautiful area.
[185:57.81]Watch out coming down.
[186:00.07]So, I mean, the thing is, what they're looking for is they're looking for 29,000... Oh, Jesus Christ, what?
[186:04.88]Ah!
[186:04.94]Get down!
[186:05.36]Why?
[186:05.46]Ah!
[186:05.52]Ah!
[186:20.81]Get out quick!
[186:32.16]And scene.
[186:33.16]Cap that one.
[186:33.88]Cap that one right there.
[186:36.20]Cap it.
[186:37.38]29,000.
[186:38.10]I wonder why.
[186:38.68]And there it is.
[186:47.43]Share that one with your friends.
[186:49.71]and title it, Hilarious Realtor Moment.
[186:56.57]Alright, let's go.
[187:05.16]God!
[187:05.32]That's gonna happen in my own place.
[187:07.48]Alright, what's next?
[187:13.72]A hard drive.
[187:16.54]This'll be easy.
[187:18.81]I'm tangling up again.
[187:19.73]God damn it.
[187:22.15]Damn it.
[187:22.61]I'm all... Whatever.
[187:26.87]This will be fun.
[187:28.38]You guys like computers.
[187:34.26]I'll show you how to destroy a hard drive, guys.
[187:36.50]It's pretty simple.
[187:47.95]I didn't even destroy it.
[187:49.47]I didn't get the most important part.
[188:24.54]This is actually interesting.
[188:25.46]I don't know what it looks like in here.
[188:27.86]The only thing I know about a hard drive is it's a brick.
[188:31.52]It's just a cube that stores data.
[188:33.30]I don't know how.
[188:35.05]I think there's another computer in here, right?
[188:38.01]I know how a hard drive works.
[188:40.33]It's hard disk.
[188:41.17]It's magnetic.
[188:42.17]I'm not stupid.
[188:43.21]I'm not going to let you use that one to fucking hurt me.
[188:47.77]You know what I mean?
[188:50.50]Can't get it with that?
[188:51.62]Why not?
[189:20.28]Wow.
[189:22.84]Interesting.
[189:23.38]So it's a record player.
[189:24.84]That's what it looks like in there?
[189:27.34]It's a record player!
[189:31.26]I don't want to say I don't want to say
[190:10.53]What did I get?
[190:12.30]That's it?
[190:14.88]Well, that's not... Gas tank.
[190:26.48]How do you think it operates, guys?
[190:29.15]Oh, whoa, I need to get some...
[190:31.22]Let's just like put you guys over here.
[190:36.20]Sit down and relax for these.
[190:38.12]I gotta get, that means I can, you know what, you're right.
[190:39.85]I guess you're gonna.
[190:44.47]I'm like standing too much.
[190:57.48]Whoa.
[190:58.88]It's made out of gold.
[191:22.65]See you guys in the next video!
[191:58.61]ah screwdriver no not a screwdriver what I had the right tool the little baby screwdriver the little baby one ew
[192:31.38]That's what it was, the vein.
[192:57.25]Can you just break stuff?
[192:58.15]Yeah, I could probably whip it against the wall, but I'll lose the parts and I won't know where to go.
[193:03.78]What do I need here?
[193:07.84]A wrench or something?
[193:09.27]How do I get this off?
[193:39.89]I don't think it's the crowbar.
[193:41.57]Whoa, holy shit, it was the crowbar.
[193:47.27]No, it wasn't.
[193:52.20]I can't grab that.
[193:53.02]Come on, get in there.
[193:56.72]What?
[193:59.58]Oh, screws.
[194:16.44]Three more parts left.
[194:19.93]Well this obviously, what's this being held on by?
[194:22.09]Something's still grabbing this right here.
[194:26.55]No.
[194:29.13]What's still holding on to that?
[194:40.10]There's something, ah, there's still a screw in here.
[194:51.91]One more part.
[194:53.77]This chord is going all the way up my, you know the word.
[194:58.85]This thing right here.
[195:06.11]Bring out the beeper.
[195:30.73]I did it.
[195:31.16]That's it.
[195:32.34]Okay.
[195:33.42]Nice.
[195:35.72]Alright.
[195:36.27]I think we're coming up on a blender, I think.
[195:53.80]I'm going to make it so you don't see this because it'll hurt your eyes.
[195:58.24]So let me just do this.
[196:02.79]I wish there was like a detangler for the bike.
[196:05.61]See, it ends up bunching up like this.
[196:06.83]Oh, you can't see me.
[196:07.89]Never mind.
[196:08.81]Wait, I don't... Sorry.
[196:17.30]So look, you can see it goes like this and gets taut.
[196:24.84]It's like I need to stand on my table and like really wring it out.
[196:30.97]Alright, let's wring it out here.
[196:32.01]Get the suspension wires off Amazon.
[196:37.25]Yeah, but I don't know if I can put the, I don't have like a drop ceiling.
[196:40.18]Don't you need a drop ceiling to do that?
[196:43.06]Or does it, can you actually get something to stick on the ceiling?
[196:45.36]I feel like it would fall off and I'd get hurt.
[197:06.58]Cable sleeves?
[197:08.80]I wonder if the cable sleeves are not just bunched up too.
[197:18.78]We'll see.
[197:20.22]How the fuck did I stream this in VR for like six to seven hours two days ago drunk?
[197:39.27]That's insane to me.
[197:42.45]And I did a backflip.
[197:52.01]I did, if you weren't here, somebody link it.
[197:54.13]It was a full backflip.
[197:55.89]Not baby sister falls down because she's like four and a half months.
[198:03.07]You know, not like baby brother falls.
[198:08.96]It's a backflip, man.
[198:14.59]Let's get in.
[198:15.89]I think blender's coming up next.
[198:36.57]I've done a lot.
[198:37.39]Blender, coffee machine, sink, Lego van, Hellfire missile, rice cooker, a saw.
[198:49.68]Let's go to the blender.
[198:50.46]I gotta be careful.
[198:51.56]I feel like, can I blend myself?
[198:53.48]Oh, you can blend.
[198:59.02]Oh, wow.
[199:49.14]Oh!
[200:20.32]That was fucking terrifying, actually.
[200:22.01]Hold on, I'm not done.
[201:09.90]That was loud as fuck.
[201:18.98]Can I blend a grenade?
[201:19.78]I feel like I have to try.
[201:26.55]What about one of the little things, right?
[201:29.23]Like the little, the Allen wrench, here.
[201:46.28]Get in!
[201:46.74]The whole purpose of this is to be able to feed things
[202:47.73]No!
[202:49.01]Let's try and restart.
[202:58.12]Coffee maker too?
[203:00.37]Okay, here we go.
[203:01.75]Last thing I want to try.
[203:17.62]That's not good.
[203:21.37]This thing's still spinning.
[204:02.00]I don't want to let's do it for real for real
[204:28.12]Pop the top off the lid, and as fast as you can say, Bob's your uncle, Bobby's your aunt, you've got a delicious strawberry smoothie in the magic bullet.
[204:40.84]How many parts?
[204:54.73]62, give me a break.
[204:59.75]thing up what a hazard KCH brand unbelievable let's get a good look at this so we've got screws down here
[205:31.62]Come on, you fucking Darth Vader mask, stay here.
[205:37.44]Look at how tiny this is.
[205:38.62]Ready for this?
[205:42.95]You got one sound.
[206:08.67]Look at that.
[206:10.21]Now look at this.
[206:11.29]Need the little one.
[206:19.77]Are you fucking kidding me?
[206:31.51]Are you?
[206:34.29]Are you kidding me?
[206:38.94]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[206:41.34]No, I don't have it.
[206:43.74]No, how am I supposed to get it?
[206:45.00]I don't get how precise that had to be.
[206:55.97]These are the later levels, you can tell.
[207:02.66]Just one step at a time.
[207:12.91]Are you shitting me?
[207:16.63]I'm like sweating so much.
[207:18.92]My gross, disgusting beard.
[207:22.96]I can feel it.
[207:24.40]Like water on it.
[207:26.56]That's just gross.
[207:28.60]I can't wait to shave and take a bath.
[207:42.51]I have to shower every day.
[207:44.77]If I don't shower every single day, it's a nightmare.
[207:49.11]It's bad.
[207:51.93]Can you guys even see me?
[207:53.73]Kinda.
[208:00.87]I cannot go more than a day.
[208:03.21]I just feel terrible.
[208:08.00]Alright, what do we got in here?
[208:10.96]We need some clippers.
[208:21.99]Can these sides come off?
[208:27.19]Wait.
[208:27.77]Okay.
[208:31.41]Anything else inside of here?
[208:33.45]Is this thing... Ah.
[208:38.60]Got it.
[208:42.86]Now what?
[208:47.61]The tiny little beer cans.
[208:50.25]How the f... Ah.
[209:11.75]Getting there.
[209:16.13]It requires patience.
[209:20.30]And a steady arm that I don't have.
[209:21.72]Okay, let's get the clippers.
[209:31.34]I want the tweezers so bad.
[209:34.94]Can I pull this out like this?
[209:43.44]Don't worry, you're probably saying, like, oh, your cable management just sucks.
[209:46.36]What's with the cable?
[209:47.58]I'm going to shake it up.
[209:56.88]Might need that in a minute.
[210:05.11]Ah.
[210:07.51]Oh.
[210:09.03]I'm feeling it.
[210:11.16]I'm feeling it.
[210:11.74]Alright, see?
[210:12.82]Now... Please shake it off.
[210:21.03]Perfect.
[210:23.19]Perfect.
[210:23.73]Put that there.
[210:31.07]How do I get this off?
[210:34.34]I have to go from the other side.
[210:35.58]Oh, yeah.
[210:42.78]Oh yeah!
[210:44.50]Is it a screw or an Allen wrench?
[210:47.08]Oh yeah, I thought I had it.
[210:49.14]I thought that was the one.
[210:52.08]I thought this was the one.
[211:03.67]Now I actually might be able to get in there.
[211:06.13]No, it's too big!
[211:06.85]It's too big.
[211:09.03]Yeah, that shit's too big.
[211:18.16]Well, that wasn't supposed to happen.
[211:27.08]Come on, I can get the fan!
[211:31.92]Holy shit, there's a lot.
[211:36.28]This is the motor.
[211:39.98]Nothing's too big if you try hard enough.
[211:42.04]Can you hold the whole blender in one hand and the screwdriver in the other?
[211:50.16]Yeah, you can.
[211:59.63]It's kind of hard though because your eyes, you guys are seeing only the right eye.
[212:03.19]So this is what you guys get to see.
[212:04.69]But my left eye is in play and the left eye is what you guys don't see the left eye.
[212:08.91]So when I pull it close like this, I get that weird, like when you put something too close to your face, you start to see like double.
[212:15.53]Like, oh, I can't, it's just hard to see right now because I see, I don't have like a full resolution one eye.
[212:20.73]So it's actually sometimes easier to see it from like here rather than like go like this or like that, you know?
[212:35.50]What am I missing?
[212:36.04]The pliers?
[212:42.00]No?
[212:43.10]What?
[212:51.25]What am I missing here?
[212:58.29]Not the wrench.
[212:59.87]How do I get that off?
[213:04.23]Dumb.
[213:04.75]Dumb.
[213:07.23]Why am I dumb?
[213:12.36]Try to just close one eye.
[213:18.20]Jupiter?
[213:21.75]But apparently that's not it.
[213:33.98]What is it then?
[213:36.56]What?
[213:36.80]I'm going to have to take that apart.
[213:42.18]Look at that.
[213:42.78]I want to get a good look at that one.
[213:45.31]Same with this.
[213:48.49]And I think that's all she wrote on here.
[214:08.93]These little ones?
[214:10.79]Out the window?
[214:11.37]Sure.
[214:53.88]Is that it?
[214:54.26]I feel like that's not it.
[215:00.91]Whoa.
[215:04.69]Holy shit.
[215:12.94]Does that get five more parts?
[215:24.15]It's gotta be this thing.
[215:24.97]Let's go with the wrench maybe?
[215:30.47]Just like pry it off.
[215:37.69]What am I missing?
[215:38.21]Might as well take out the tool.
[215:51.34]What?
[215:51.62]Oh.
[216:06.04]What of it, though?
[216:07.40]The little pieces?
[216:12.93]It's not the little tiny pieces, right?
[216:17.85]Whoa!
[216:20.11]OK, it was that.
[216:22.93]Now what?
[216:34.55]Something over here.
[216:41.09]Oh, it's the motor.
[216:55.44]Got it.
[216:59.20]Oh, not the motor, the blade.
[217:00.50]You know what I'm trying to say.
[217:07.25]Cool.
[217:08.75]Coffee Baker.
[217:14.51]And then sink?
[217:16.89]I'm gonna try the missile.
[217:19.83]I feel like I should jump to one of these.

[219:05.72]Can I take this apart?
[219:10.82]Oh, that's a filter.
[219:13.74]I feel like I'm gonna have to come back to this one.
[219:15.42]It's a little twisty here, right?
[219:18.51]There are 93 parts.
[219:25.37]I'm going to do this slowly and steady.
[219:30.83]Nothing here.
[219:32.94]If there's nothing there, get rid of it.
[219:38.82]Nothing right.
[219:42.00]This might be... I might need to use that later.
[219:44.46]Nothing, right?
[219:45.38]Smash it.
[219:47.71]I would wager by those because I would love to have them.
[220:03.98]I might need to restart the game.
[220:05.40]I'm getting a little frame ready.
[220:12.52]Is this... I might need that later.
[220:14.42]Don't need this.
[220:21.07]Come on, get out of there.
[220:25.19]I can't turn it?
[220:25.85]Oh, there's the water tank.

[221:13.41]Screws?
[221:16.72]These are thick.
[221:30.92]Alright, something's still holding onto it.
[221:51.73]All those guts are going to fall out here.
[222:04.11]Still attached.

[223:54.29]I don't know why that's something I'm doing, but that's the second time I've done it.
[224:35.02]That's what it looks like.
[224:41.37]This is what it looks like inside your computer.

[236:00.10]What do we got?
[236:05.46]Sink, missile, titanic, car, plane, train, space station,
[236:26.78]Has it been like four hours?
[236:34.34]Come on, I can do more than four.
[236:36.66]Usually I can do like four and a half to five.
[236:38.21]Alright, we're gonna do like one or two more.
[236:40.11]Nah, it's too early.
[236:44.67]I'll do one more.
[236:46.89]I'm just so drained.
[237:00.57]I beat this whole damn game.
[237:05.26]You know, it was the rage in the house.
[237:08.80]It was the house rage.
[237:11.09]This one's going to be quick.
[237:12.05]I can do two more.
[237:33.12]This shit is too fragile!

[238:14.47]Oh, Jesus.
[238:25.56]I can't turn it off anymore.
[238:30.60]My batter rang out of the way.
[238:32.02]Alright.
[238:34.98]You see, what your problem is, is you halt through the sink.
[238:40.32]I think that's probably what the issue is here.
[238:45.04]But I've been wrong.
[238:50.06]Can you fix it?
[238:50.80]I can, I fixed it.
[238:52.64]No, I don't think so.
[238:53.89]You're gonna have to call a real bummer.
[239:00.39]I'm just gonna steal all these parts.
[239:01.89]You know how much copper is worth?
[239:23.27]Is there anything I can do about that?
[239:29.07]Look, I got to get under here.
[239:39.36]Oh, that was the water.
[239:43.50]Would you look at that?
[239:44.56]And we can pop this.
[239:50.76]No, we can't.
[239:57.93]Now you can pop this.

[240:45.23]Oh shit, okay.

[247:22.70]The little silver thing.
[247:41.83]This is copper.
[247:42.59]That's not what you meant.
[248:02.11]That's not the right way.
[248:04.49]It's not the right way.
[248:06.17]Way.
[248:06.75]I'm so tired right now.
[248:09.41]I'm just like slugging on the ground.
[248:12.21]Imagine you walked in.
[248:14.47]You walked in.
[248:15.08]There's a guy preparing your sink.
[248:17.28]And he's crouching, lying on the ground, just going, there's no way.
[248:22.54]I don't know where it is.
[248:23.72]I don't understand.
[248:25.94]Do you?
[248:28.38]And you see a little thing.
[248:30.95]You'd be like, holy shit, you'd get out of my fucking house.
[248:33.97]Imagine his Jerm is on his tiptoes.
[248:36.25]That's funny.
[248:41.73]I'm looking for one of these.
[248:43.53]I honestly have no fucking idea what's going on.
[248:45.48]Alright, so.
[248:49.82]Mouse plumber.
[248:54.88]It's this thing.

[249:12.82]No, don't use the gun.
[249:25.65]I can't get in here.
[249:53.51]Oh, I fixed your sink.
[249:56.19]That'll be $400.
[249:56.71]You can write me a check.
[250:03.64]That's B-A-C, reverse plumbing and heating.
[250:12.52]God.
[250:23.41]I don't know.
[250:23.85]I'm out of fucking juice.
[250:30.62]Let's see, what do I got?
[250:36.12]Let's at least look at it, okay?
[250:37.82]Let's look at it.
[250:42.62]It's so small.
[250:44.38]Alright.
[250:45.62]Oh my God, can I pick the whole thing?
[250:50.08]This is tiny.
[250:52.38]Oh my god, I want to put it on the ground and lie down.
[250:57.06]I can't put it on the ground and lie down.
[250:59.66]I have an idea.
[251:04.65]I'm just going to lie on the table.
[251:09.23]Alright.
[251:10.53]Yeah, that's just how we do this.
[251:12.13]Alright.
[251:14.65]I feel like I'm about to eat grapes from a vine.
[251:20.10]Oh, yeah.
[251:20.78]Come on.
[251:21.40]Come on in, sweetheart.
[251:24.40]Yeah.
[251:24.88]Do you think this is sexy, what I'm doing here?
[251:27.27]That's right.
[251:33.99]Seriously.
[251:35.27]I can't throw it.
[251:36.52]This one's actually going to take not that long.
[251:38.18]Ready?
[251:38.38]Watch this.
[252:14.62]feels like this is how it's like to be a cat.
[252:51.60]Get off the counter!
[253:26.99]Every cat can like, fucking slowly fall off a table.
[253:31.01]Yeah, they always land on their forefront feet.
[253:34.01]You know why that is?
[253:34.83]Because when they fall, they fall in slow motion.
[253:37.39]Alright, one more.
[253:40.29]I don't know what, whoops.
[253:40.95]Alright, give her some juice.
[254:00.03]Ah, I can't, I can't, I don't know.
[254:01.97]Some other gas?
[254:02.79]Let me move this shit out of the way.
[254:07.53]Well, the engine's running.
[254:09.33]Let me just try something.
[254:11.66]Give it a little bit more gas.
[254:12.66]Yeah.
[254:18.02]Yeah, that's a car fixing, uh... I'm invincible.
[254:25.47]I didn't tell you I was invincible.
[254:35.67]Alright, we have to dissect a missile.
[254:44.24]Hellfire missile.
[255:17.34]I can't throw the missile?
[255:18.50]I always thought you had to be careful with this shit.
[255:34.83]Alright, why inside of a missile are there just a bunch of Christmas decorations?
[255:40.43]That was, that was a part, that was a piñata.
[255:43.73]That was a novelty piñata.
[255:51.62]That was going to be scary.
[255:53.13]No, apparently not.
[256:08.65]Will it, does it explode?
[256:09.83]Maybe it's because I took off the on button.
[256:13.53]Hold on.
[256:18.48]Maybe I can use a starter.
[256:28.10]I mean, there was clearly a second explosion.
[256:30.76]But the little cartoon grenade was more powerful than the... whatever this is.
[256:35.00]Like, this missile.
[256:39.18]There it goes.
[256:41.64]Look at how... I just want to just look at how many parts are everywhere.
[256:47.02]I want to see how many parts this is.
[256:48.38]This is going to be, like, probably 200 parts.
[256:51.32]102.
[256:51.94]Damn.
[256:52.06]Alright.
[256:58.98]I think that's gonna be it.
[257:04.26]Four and a half, like, just about four and a half hours.
[257:05.74]We'll do bits about five hours.
[257:08.00]I gotta take a break.
[257:12.18]Gravity Gun?
[257:12.79]Well, I'm gonna play this tomorrow.
[257:16.37]So, I... This is what we're doing tomorrow.
[257:20.83]Because that was fun as hell.
[257:22.47]That was great.
[257:28.41]You'll forget about tomorrow.
[257:29.73]I'm not going to forget tomorrow.
[257:33.60]No, I'm not taking tomorrow off.
[257:34.56]I took yesterday off.
[257:42.22]No, we'll do it tomorrow.
[257:44.57]Get in Minecraft VR.
[257:47.27]I did expect I was going to play it for four and a half hours.
[257:56.11]You're always going to forget?
[257:56.91]No, I'll be live tomorrow.
[258:00.43]At least throw the missile out the window.
[258:01.83]Okay, I'm going to try to get the missile out the window.
[258:03.54]No, it won't go out the window.
[258:05.46]Watch, just watch.
[258:13.56]Yeah, typically, two nights ago was not an indicator of a VR stream.
[258:17.85]Usually my VR streams are only like four to five hours.
[258:21.12]Because I can't be in here for that long.
[258:23.31]I just can't.
[258:23.81]I don't know how the fuck I did it for like seven hours two nights ago.
[258:27.77]I'm just shit-faced.
[258:31.41]Alright, let me try.
[258:31.97]Alright, I'm going to try to get out of here.
[258:39.08]I need to break this precisely.
[258:45.14]Wait, I have this now?
[258:47.02]I didn't know I had this.
[258:53.12]This is why you guys were saying that.
[258:55.10]How do I use it?
[259:00.19]Is this all it does?
[259:12.00]Trigger pressure adjusts grab force.
[259:15.72]Oh, okay, I see.
[259:21.62]It's actually kind of useful.
[259:24.02]Alright, let's... Let's get out of here.
[259:27.87]See if I can actually get this out the window.
[259:30.91]Right here.
[259:32.37]Okay, come with me.
[259:53.91]That ain't going out there.
[260:11.19]I'll try again.
[260:22.13]There's a wall here, I can't get it.
[260:29.62]The Christmas gold thing!
[260:31.80]Gravity gun from the outside.
[260:42.08]Move the window.
[260:44.04]Shoot the Lego van.
[260:56.48]Why do I recognize this sound effect?
[260:57.86]Because it's a stalk sound effect.
[261:00.12]Don't look down.
[261:03.05]The Christmas gold thing.
[261:04.27]That's how you know I'm at a gas.
[261:11.63]Ah, the Christmas gold thing.
[261:14.30]Alright, I'll turn it off.
[261:17.34]Can't hear it anymore.
[261:18.84]Alright, let's just chill for a little bit.
[261:24.59]If you're going to take off, you take off.
[261:25.75]But I'm not going to turn the stream off completely.
[261:27.67]I'm going to get the chair back in here.
[261:29.86]We'll hang out.
[261:31.46]Do the bits.
[261:32.14]Chill for like 30-40 minutes.
[261:36.44]Yeah, I'll post that on Twitter.
[261:40.32]Yeah, we're going to go in low power mode.
[261:43.00]Sometimes it just does it to me.
[261:45.75]You looking at the sun?
[261:46.87]Sorry about that.
[261:48.73]I'll be right back.
[261:50.15]We'll go for like another 30-40 plus minutes.
[261:53.92]Gotta go over five hours, alright?
[261:55.83]Well, we don't have to, but... We will.
[264:58.99]Ah, that's another thing, man.
[264:59.93]It is like a thousand degrees in here.
[265:02.61]Just adds to it.
[265:03.31]I think VRJosh was talking about it.
[265:06.19]I need to get like a fan to just go, but then it kind of makes noise.
[265:13.56]From outside in the hall to this room, it's like at least 20 degrees different.
[265:21.66]That's it on top of it too.
[265:22.64]That's another reason why I got to get some like circulation.
[265:26.65]But,
[265:28.46]I'm happy with going four hours in VR.
[265:30.20]That's kind of typical.
[265:33.90]Last time before shit-faced Saturday.
[265:40.53]I didn't want it to be less than four hours, though.
[265:41.97]That's too small, too short.
[265:46.15]But let's just go like this.
[265:48.73]Just hang out for a little bit.
[265:51.43]I'm going to move this over here.
[265:54.69]Can I not do that?
[265:56.09]I should be able to.
[265:58.84]Hey, look, full camera.
[266:03.38]Needs to be brought down a little, though.
[266:05.10]This is what it looked like without glasses.
[266:09.30]See?
[266:11.36]People are going, whoa, that's what it looks like without glasses?
[266:13.40]Yeah.
[266:16.44]Bring it down a little.
[266:22.63]I don't want to get stretched.
[266:25.27]Why is this camera doing this?
[266:29.64]That's because it's up too high.
[266:32.88]There we go.
[266:35.34]Alright.
[266:36.76]Here's the portion of the stream where we're just going to sit around and hang out for a little while.
[266:41.62]Maybe like 30-40 minutes.
[266:42.46]We'll do the bits while we chill.
[266:45.28]I'm going to get the chat over here too.
[266:46.64]I need to be able to see what you guys are saying.
[266:48.37]Did I X out of it?
[266:52.69]Like an idiot.
[266:55.81]Alright, so see, okay, everyone, okay, the drunk stream two nights ago.
[266:59.21]When I took that headset off and I was sitting here, everyone's like, look at how red he is.
[267:03.11]He's fucked up.
[267:04.05]Look at his hair.
[267:04.73]This is just, I'm normal human, not drunk guy.
[267:08.44]And it's the same shit.
[267:11.44]So see, he's drunk again.
[267:16.94]Look at how flushed and fucking sloppy he is.
[267:20.68]No.
[267:22.24]Labo VR, I'm going to do Labo VR.
[267:23.72]You already know that.
[267:28.15]Only a drunk person would say something like that.
[267:29.97]Alright, let's get the bits on here.
[267:35.99]Let's go like this.
[267:37.74]If you take it off, we'll see you tomorrow.
[267:40.26]More take stuff apart.
[267:41.74]I can't wait to take apart the plane.
[267:46.20]I think I found my new House Flipper.
[267:51.31]I'm for real.
[267:56.84]What's on my face?
[267:58.52]Uh, a dirty beard that I haven't shaved yet.
[268:00.68]And I probably won't do it until tomorrow night.
[268:05.00]Is that game of the year?
[268:09.16]Don't say that yet.
[268:11.93]We still got like another few months.
[268:13.83]Well, like seven.
[268:18.05]Yes, I'm going to do the, I will do the new Labo sets.
[268:19.85]I promise.
[268:21.79]Alright.
[268:22.05]So let's go back a little while ago.
[268:26.10]We had Icy Yuppie gave $10 earlier.
[268:29.67]They said, cool stream, kiddo.
[268:32.29]Thank you.
[268:32.89]Thanks for coming out.
[268:34.21]Hope you enjoyed it.
[268:36.45]Can we collab?
[268:37.27]Can we collab?
[268:38.01]Can we collab?
[268:41.81]What are you talking about?
[268:43.21]Why is everybody saying that?
[268:47.78]Can we collab?
[268:51.02]That was happening before the stream started.
[268:55.95]Well, the answer is no.
[268:57.85]No, I don't do collabs.
[268:59.21]I do organic, accidental, if somebody's a friend and we do something.
[269:03.42]I don't do collabs.
[269:09.92]Well, these faces, you know, I never thought, I never knew what that was until I had Better twitch.tv.
[269:18.64]I thought you guys would just always, I didn't know that was an actual emote face.
[269:24.31]Play Toribash.
[269:25.83]Me and Star played Toribash a couple years ago.
[269:28.17]About six years ago, actually.
[269:33.30]That was a long time.
[269:34.08]It was like 2012.
[269:34.84]If you want to watch Toribash, me play Toribash with a friend, that video is still there.
[269:41.92]What's in here?
[269:44.99]You think that's still alright?
[269:51.83]I don't think so.
[269:53.77]Plus, it's like 9 o'clock at night.
[269:54.95]Why would I do that?
[269:56.61]But thank you to IcyYupi for the $10.
[270:00.49]SmellyBoy, thanks for the $2.50.
[270:02.74]Please, please, please tell us where Shido is.
[270:04.62]I heard he's going to prison for trying to 3D print.
[270:07.22]What are you talking about?
[270:10.68]Shido's in the other room.
[271:07.03]So what you guys didn't know is I can actually do these noises with my mouth.
[271:13.47]You know what I mean?
[271:15.89]So I'm sorry that Shido's no longer here.
[271:23.72]Show us.
[271:38.74]Yeah, this is in the cartoon when the big giant monster eats the person or eats the character that is in the show or something or like a squeaky toy.
[271:50.15]And every time they try to talk, they're just, they usually have a booming voice like this.
[271:54.47]And then when they open their mouth, they like swallow it and they eat it.
[271:57.37]Oh, no, the character's dead.
[271:59.69]I did that.
[272:08.26]And then it becomes like a joke.
[272:12.00]There, she does it right here.
[272:13.56]You're fine.
[272:14.74]See?
[272:17.68]Everybody thought I threw it away.
[272:18.90]Why did I throw this away?
[272:21.84]Somebody says, you're a joke, Jeremy.
[272:28.21]Uh-uh.
[272:38.56]I got nothing to say about that.
[272:40.01]You're probably right.
[272:48.43]You're a joke.
[272:51.11]It's alright.
[272:53.03]There's worse things I could be.
[272:57.55]Anyways, let's keep going.
[273:02.94]That was Smelly Boy.
[273:03.72]We proved it.
[273:04.22]So, Number Guts.
[273:05.10]Ten bucks from Number Guts.
[273:05.92]Thank you, Number Guts.
[273:08.40]Consider my wig snatched bald.
[273:15.83]I don't know what that means.
[273:18.45]My wig?
[273:20.79]I mean, I know this looks bad.
[273:23.67]I don't know.
[273:24.05]It might not even be what you're referring to.
[273:26.15]But thank you.
[273:29.00]Also, Zach said, Zach SD, Zach Keist, hope I'm saying that right, $10.
[273:37.55]Hey, man, I genuinely appreciate your content and the effort you put into it.
[273:40.51]Your videos and streams got me through some tough times.
[273:42.47]Cheers from Finland.
[273:44.67]Cheers back to you.
[273:45.53]Thank you.
[273:49.23]Thank you for the $10.
[273:50.08]Thanks for sticking around the community.
[273:52.86]Kim check.
[273:53.72]Kim is not in there.
[273:54.88]I was just downstairs.
[273:58.65]But, uh, thanks for the $10.
[274:04.67]I appreciate every one of you guys that comes out and watches this channel, so.
[274:09.83]I couldn't do it without you.
[274:11.29]It wouldn't be possible.
[274:13.04]So thank you.
[274:16.42]Kim, Kim.
[274:19.14]I almost just ran over my VR headset.
[274:22.20]I almost just crushed it.
[274:23.80]And I would have blamed all of you.
[274:25.22]I would have put the blame on you guys.
[274:27.85]That's like $500.
[274:28.77]I would have just crushed it.
[274:31.36]I'll prove it again.
[274:32.08]There's nobody in here.
[274:40.50]Okay, the boy who cried wolf.
[274:41.86]I'm going to do that so many times that one time someone's going to be actually in there.
[274:48.47]It's messy.
[274:49.01]It is messy in there.
[274:49.79]It's very messy.
[274:51.19]It's an incredibly messy closet, but it's okay.
[274:54.95]But thank you, Zach.
[274:55.99]Appreciate it.
[274:57.33]Superintendent Chalmers, $2.66.
[274:58.37]What do I think about the Star Wars Episode IX trailer?
[275:02.52]If you haven't seen it, do a YouTuber reaction on stream.
[275:04.92]I already saw it.
[275:08.05]There's not enough info to go on.
[275:09.79]But there's some characters...
[275:12.54]Seems pretty cool.
[275:14.39]If people are trying to avoid spoilers, I don't really want to talk about it because a lot of people don't want to read or see spoilers.
[275:21.03]And there are a few things in that trailer that could be, wow, I wish I didn't know that, right?
[275:26.52]So, there are a few characters.
[275:30.38]I'm not going to tell you who they are, but they're in it.
[275:34.28]that you have an Ant-Man shirt on because you can relate to being incredibly talented and very handsome and soaring like an eagle and be very, really cool and like Paul Rudd's really cool and he's like 50 years old and he looks like he's fucking 28.
[275:49.20]What a person to be compared to.
[275:50.26]Thanks for comparing me to Paul Rudd.
[275:51.40]I appreciate that.
[275:52.00]It means a lot.
[276:02.10]Stormy Chewie.
[276:03.04]I missed this.
[276:04.80]I missed this.
[276:08.20]Stormychoo gave $50.
[276:10.34]5,000 bits from Stormychoo.
[276:12.84]Thank you so much for the $50.
[276:13.90]Wanted to remind you that you're the best streamer.
[276:17.02]Whenever I'm in a bad mood, you can always manage to make me laugh.
[276:19.55]You're doing great things, and I hope you and chat have a wonderful evening.
[276:24.37]Thank you.
[276:25.55]I'm sure other people in chat are happy to hear that as well.
[276:33.52]you wishing everybody a wonderful evening um for as much as people give me credit right like so many people here are so funny and I see so many people write like oh like hey have a good evening chat or like oh chat me I met some friends in chat or it there's so much fucking going on here that
[276:59.81]You guys are also nice.
[277:00.61]Look, we fuck around a lot.
[277:01.41]We do.
[277:02.03]But everyone's so nice to each other.
[277:03.79]It's refreshing.
[277:06.39]So many people are just fun here.
[277:08.18]And there's a huge difference.
[277:10.30]I know, like I said, we say shit.
[277:12.38]We make fun of stuff.
[277:14.12]I mean, like I said, like 80% of the stuff we say is just bullshit.
[277:17.64]You guys all know that.
[277:19.23]But I'm shocked and surprised every day at just how...
[277:26.25]like, fun of a community this is.
[277:28.85]I'm very fortunate.
[277:30.49]So.
[277:34.15]100% of what I say is bullshit.
[277:36.16]Well, there you go.
[277:36.56]At least you made it clear now.
[277:43.38]But Stormy, thank you for the $50.
[277:45.04]That's more money than I could ever ask anyone to ever hand me through a stream.
[277:50.77]So, thank you.
[277:52.71]That means a shitload.
[277:56.09]50 bucks.
[277:59.45]Make sure to floss too, as Grub Club says, yes.
[278:02.93]Chunky Bologna, 10 bucks.
[278:06.29]$10 from Chunky Bologna, thank you.
[278:08.23]In summer camp one year, I was messing around with a bicycle tire just like that and accidentally busted somebody's lip open.
[278:14.98]They had to go to the hospital and get multiple stitches.
[278:24.38]Don't do that, be careful.
[278:26.66]You can actually get fucked up like that, don't do it.
[278:31.66]Accidentally, in quotes.
[278:35.78]Guys, it's not like you're gonna spin the wheel and go after somebody with it.
[278:42.40]They do that on Malcolm in the Middle, is that where that's from?
[278:45.78]I thought it was from Pee Wee Herman.
[278:49.79]Doesn't that happen in Pee Wee?
[278:51.21]That happens in Pee Wee Herman's movie, right?
[278:59.38]That definitely happens in a Pee Wee Herman bit.
[279:04.35]I think so.
[279:09.29]What happens?
[279:09.79]The bike thing, when you spin the bike upside down so the wheels are pointing up and then somebody goes like this with the wheel and then somebody else's face gets like burnt on the, that's from a Pee Wee Herman.
[279:26.16]He's still on this.
[279:27.20]I'm not.
[279:27.96]Somebody just brought it up and I'm explaining.
[279:30.38]Is it supposed to be end stream music?
[279:34.47]Uh, I don't have the end screen up.
[279:36.75]We're just chilling out.
[279:38.41]I'm almost done.
[279:38.85]There's not very many more left to go, so.
[279:45.34]He's gonna go until someone says yes.
[279:47.06]What do you mean?
[279:49.00]But thank you, Chunky Ballona.
[279:50.10]And that sounds like a horrible fucking story.
[279:52.78]Hopefully everyone's alright.
[279:55.62]Number Guts, $5 from Number Guts.
[279:57.04]Hey, Jerma, me and my partners have watched you for a long time, and you've been an incredible and consistent source of joy.
[280:03.27]I've been going through a lot over the past few years, and your content's helped me make some of the real bad days a little easier.
[280:09.21]Thank you.
[280:12.28]Thank you for being here.
[280:14.58]And I say it a lot, but I have to say it a lot, because I really only fucking care about us having a good time.
[280:23.52]If you are having fun, that's fucking awesome.
[280:25.61]I'm glad because that's all I give a shit about.
[280:27.71]All this, this, this, all this, this room, this room, the whole room is just, I want to have fun.
[280:35.57]And I want you to do too.
[280:38.47]The whole thing.
[280:40.35]I'll rip, I'll rip that closet door off if it means you're going to have fun.
[280:43.93]I will rip it off with my bare hands and I will snap it off my fucking knee like a twig in a dream, in fake reality, not real.
[280:55.05]I can't do that.
[280:55.85]95% of everything I say is not true.
[281:00.09]Use a screwdriver for it.
[281:01.33]Yeah, I'm just going to go over there and like rip it off the hinges.
[281:06.28]You won't do that for us.
[281:07.58]I'm not going to.
[281:08.02]No.
[281:12.02]Oh, rum fun.
[281:13.97]Rum.
[281:15.41]Rum.
[281:16.87]My rum.
[281:17.77]My room.
[281:21.57]Jeremy, you look defeated.
[281:23.19]No, I look like I was in VR for four and a half hours.
[281:26.91]This is why the drunk, I told you the drunk stream was so much worse.
[281:31.46]I said this in the chat in the beginning of the stream, but I want to make it clear again.
[281:35.80]When you drink and do VR, you save state yourself outside of the headset.
[281:43.19]So when I was like drinking the wine and going in the headset,
[281:48.27]Reality was different.
[281:49.71]I was like getting drunker because like in the headset, I wasn't drunk.
[281:54.43]When the headset would come off, it'd be like I was save-stating my drunkenness.
[281:58.43]It was crazy.
[282:02.01]And VRJosh was talking about how because in the headset, he's right.
[282:07.02]You don't see blurry vision in VR.
[282:08.60]It's everything so crystal clear that you don't even realize.
[282:14.91]So you take the headset off and all of a sudden you take another sip and you're like... Holy fuck.
[282:21.84]It's just that it makes you five times drunker.
[282:23.80]Be careful.
[282:24.86]Don't drink and do VR for too long like I did.
[282:28.50]Although I was fine.
[282:29.50]But just, you know, your health is important.
[282:35.87]I would puke if I drank and put on my headset.
[282:39.13]Why do you think I needed to take yesterday off?
[282:41.81]I drank an entire bottle of wine two days ago and did VR for seven hours.
[282:45.99]I think that was energy levels.
[282:51.10]Wait, what's going on here?
[282:57.94]I'm gonna leave it.
[283:00.02]I'm gonna leave it to scare away all the new people.
[283:04.84]Where's the mouth vomit clip?
[283:06.17]I don't know, but I forgot that I did that.
[283:08.63]I did the fake Instapuke.
[283:11.01]Somebody has to have it.
[283:14.25]I went back and I looked at the VOD.
[283:17.25]Nobody laughed at this.
[283:18.69]They were concerned.
[283:19.67]I thought people were going to think it was funny because I've done it a couple of times before, but I did like the fake Instapuke swallow it.
[283:28.36]Nobody thought it was funny.
[283:30.00]It was like so realistic because I was so drunk.
[283:32.97]People were like, stop, stop, are you alright?
[283:36.93]I don't think anybody has a clip of it.
[283:42.57]I didn't even acknowledge that I did it either.
[283:47.03]Is this channel bits only?
[283:48.35]What are you talking about?
[283:49.29]I'm almost done.
[283:54.17]It's been like 15 minutes.
[283:59.49]Nobody wants to see it again.
[284:00.75]I kind of want to see it though.
[284:06.79]You were retroactively saying it was a joke.
[284:08.37]I've done that like three or four times before.
[284:14.29]I've gotten that down real well that people can fucking be confused by it.
[284:19.06]That's the snort clip.
[284:19.80]I'm not clicking that.
[284:23.88]If there's one thing that I know how to do really well, it's fake insta-puke and insta-swallow it and make it look like it actually happened.
[284:29.66]It's one of my talents.
[284:30.56]It's one of the things I can do.
[284:35.63]But let's move on.
[284:36.15]We're almost done.
[284:39.25]So, Harry, thanks for the 260.
[284:40.47]Hey, Jerma, could you please do us a favor and save the Mindshow Dreadhalls stream from last time to your channel's highlights before it's deleted?
[284:51.08]Why would it be deleted?
[284:54.58]Chat was fantastic, that whole stream, and also an integral part of understanding the Kim scare.
[284:59.38]We wouldn't want it to be lost in time.
[285:03.60]Oh, you're talking about after 60 days.
[285:06.68]Yeah, VODs deleted after two months.
[285:09.57]Um, well that means that like the drunk stream is forever etched in my Twitch bibliography.
[285:17.77]I don't know if I want to do that.
[285:21.35]That's the thing that's number one on my highlights?
[285:23.35]That would be the only one I have.
[285:26.96]Oh, yeah, man!
[285:27.80]Like, come on to Jerma985, what's he got for highlights?
[285:30.63]Let's see.
[285:31.63]Um, from 2011, testing to see if the highlight feature works with a Hand of Fate clip where he accidentally clicks on something and dies from a boulder.
[285:41.56]And he never deleted that for some reason, I don't know why he didn't.
[285:44.60]And an entire stream of him embarrassingly drunk.
[285:53.53]Sounds great.
[285:57.74]Uh, YouTube.
[285:58.46]Yeah, the YouTube archive is fine.
[286:01.60]Maybe I'll just see if we can pull the chat.
[286:08.69]Maybe I can pull that chat.
[286:12.89]There's no chat.
[286:14.77]I can pull that chat.
[286:17.55]I can pull that chat.
[286:18.31]We'll get a way to pull that chat out.
[286:23.57]Embarrassingly drunk.
[286:27.44]We'll get that chat.
[286:28.12]Don't worry.
[286:30.34]But thank you for the $2.60.
[286:30.98]Appreciate it.
[286:32.63]Ethan Ricks, thanks for $10 here.

[286:50.61]That's a heavy load to hold.
[286:52.35]I'm shocked.

[290:27.57]Thank you, JermaLiedAboutTacoBell.
[290:31.51]Damn, this streamer is kind of cringy.
[290:36.51]Why the fuck would you say something like that, okay?
[290:44.66]I can't get it to play again.
[290:54.25]This stream is kind of cringy, huh?
[290:57.88]It's interesting.
[290:59.26]Never mind.
[291:01.02]It's all fucked up.

[291:16.75]Whatever.
[291:19.17]It don't matter.
[291:26.58]Thank you for the $2.50.
[291:27.08]Jeremy lied about Fruity Loops.
[291:28.80]Not yet.
[291:30.18]Is it a lie if it eventually happens?
[291:40.93]That's not a lie.
[291:41.53]If it happens, it happens.
[291:50.80]Thank you for the 250.
[291:51.54]Thank you Novaz for the 250.

[292:03.20]I have to... Yes, yes, yes.
[292:08.03]There's so many.
[292:08.63]I gotta... Yes.
[292:15.75]So I have an Instagram.
[292:16.61]I do not have an Instagram account.
[292:18.89]I don't have any social media accounts besides Twitter.
[292:22.63]And I haven't tweeted a real tweet since like February.
[292:26.23]So I don't do social media.
[292:28.20]I'm disconnected from social media.
[292:30.62]This is the only social media that I have.
[292:33.16]YouTube channels.
[292:36.92]Twitch.
[292:38.26]My Twitter, my official Jerma985 Twitter.
[292:42.74]And that's it.
[292:43.24]I had a Facebook at one point.
[292:44.60]I haven't said anything on that Facebook in probably four and a half years.
[292:49.81]Nothing.
[292:52.65]I don't do the social media thing.
[292:54.69]Except for here, right now.
[292:56.41]My entire career is social media.
[293:00.17]But I don't do the social media thing.
[293:01.51]I don't tweet that.
[293:02.63]I don't Facebook that.
[293:10.29]How do I keep up with the new memes?
[293:12.03]You guys.
[293:13.51]I see what it is and somebody writes it and then I type it into Google and I find out what it is.
[293:17.18]And then I make references to it and I look like I'm in the hip crowd.
[293:20.18]You know?
[293:24.30]Yes, it will happen.
[293:25.36]I'm just, I know.
[293:26.92]I know.
[293:27.30]I'm bad.
[293:28.60]Mostly lost.
[293:29.16]Thanks for 250.
[293:30.68]Jeremy, you ever heard of a razor?
[293:32.29]It's a nice modern invention that can help with that shit all over your face.
[293:38.47]And that's my show.
[293:39.95]And that's the show.
[293:43.15]Thank you, T.Y.

[293:54.54]I think that was more fun than funny, but it was still fun.
[293:58.30]Maybe you thought it was funny.
[294:00.60]Glad you do.
[294:01.73]Thank you for the five dollars.

[294:43.78]Thank you for that.
[294:45.80]Fender McBender, thanks for the $3.
[294:46.98]Did you hear about that comedian who died from a heart attack on stage?
[294:55.40]And no one realized it because they thought it was a bit.
[294:57.86]That's horrifying.
[295:00.65]Yeah, that's fucking horrifying.
[295:03.32]That's terrible.
[295:10.98]That sucks.
[295:15.13]I can't even imagine how fucked up that would be.
[295:18.13]You think it might be part of a joke or a bit?
[295:20.71]Damn.
[295:29.76]Man, that's...
[295:32.20]That just makes you feel terrible, but... How long ago did that happen?
[295:36.22]When was it?
[295:42.85]Was it recently?
[295:48.35]Jesus.
[295:51.15]Yeah, that's scary shit.
[295:58.34]But... Yeah, you just gotta...
[296:01.98]You just got to be careful.
[296:04.81]At some point, maybe... Did I call level up lounge?
[296:13.97]No, not yet.
[296:16.19]That's kind of on the plan, though, for the summer.
[296:19.71]It was years ago, not yesterday.
[296:21.57]Oh, well, regardless still, that still sucks.

[296:58.40]Hello, Boss Jeremy.
[297:00.20]Just want to know, you do great things for my guy.
[297:03.39]You do great things for my guy.
[297:04.39]My mood is always automatically switched to cheerful when you start streaming.
[297:09.41]Mosh moshi.
[297:10.49]Have a good night.
[297:12.68]Well, thank you.
[297:15.33]I'm glad that you feel that way.
[297:18.65]Thanks for the $2.50.
[297:20.63]Stick around.
[297:21.03]There's more to see.
[297:23.69]Marked Shinobi, thanks for the $5.
[297:24.93]Hey, Jerma, where is Sekiro on your top FromSoftware games?
[297:30.30]And can you list your top five FromSoftware games?
[297:33.16]I'm about to play all of them because I hate myself.
[297:36.38]Love you, bro.
[297:36.78]Never missed a stream.
[297:37.60]Thank you.
[297:40.74]I can't believe that you've never missed a stream.
[297:42.74]There's a lot of times, a lot of hours.
[297:47.27]But, Sekiro is underneath Bloodborne and it's underneath Demon's Souls.
[297:52.97]So, I think the total list from least favorite to most favorite is Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Bloodborne.
[298:12.47]That's where they stand.
[298:17.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:18.58]Yes, yeah.
[298:19.25]Sekiro is above... I think Sekiro might be like tied...
[298:26.60]Yeah, let me... I gotta do that again.
[298:27.48]I gotta, like, think about it.
[298:28.23]Okay.
[298:29.27]Dark Souls 2 is my... I still liked it, but it was not as fun as the other ones, I think.
[298:33.91]Dark Souls 2 is the bottom.
[298:36.13]Dark Souls 3, mainly because I just had gotten over the Bloodborne craze, and it was like, oh, I want more Bloodborne, and this was kind of, like, fast like Bloodborne, but it wasn't... I wasn't, like, a big fan of the areas in Dark Souls 3.
[298:52.80]Something about them... There was only a few areas that I really, really liked.
[298:58.44]Then Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro are probably tied.
[299:03.43]Just because... Dark Souls 1 was just, you know, it was so interesting.
[299:10.41]I would still probably put Sekiro over Dark Souls 1.
[299:14.05]Because there's a lot of shit in Dark Souls 1 that kind of like is unfinished.
[299:18.93]Rushed a little.
[299:19.81]Two of those areas felt very... I think they even, by the admission of FromSoftware, were kind of thrown out as fast as they could.
[299:27.61]But I would probably put Sekiro a hair above Dark Souls 1.
[299:30.85]And then Demon's Souls, and then Bloodborne.
[299:33.95]Bloodborne is... If Demon's Souls is here, and Sekiro is here, like, oh, and, like, Dark... Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 1 are all, like, right here.
[299:42.26]Dark Souls 3 is, like, down here.
[299:44.02]Dark Souls 2 is down here.
[299:46.38]Bloodborne is all the way up here.
[299:49.10]You can't even see it.
[299:49.98]It's off the fucking chart.
[299:52.80]Simply said, Jell-O arm.
[299:54.02]I'm fucking 33, okay?
[299:55.26]I'm not, like, 20.
[299:57.63]I'm not 20, okay?
[299:59.49]I'm 33.
[300:00.65]I'm not 20.
[300:07.53]Fucking goddamn.
[300:09.95]This is why I never have a camera on.
[300:11.61]Ever.
[300:12.77]Because I would look over and I'll see Jell-O arm and it'll throw off my entire night.
[300:16.33]I'll be like...
[300:28.72]You don't look a day over four.
[300:30.50]Thank you.
[300:31.32]That means a lot.
[300:34.38]Tweet the fight.
[300:35.36]I have to, like, link it to my Twitter, which drunk me was not going to figure that out.
[300:40.23]So I'll figure it out.
[300:44.23]But thank you to Mark Shinobi.
[300:46.97]Hopefully that answers your question.
[300:49.27]Bloodborne's number one.
[300:50.53]Garfield, the Monday killer, $2.50.
[300:54.35]Uh, Gig Garfity Goo, here comes Garfaroni with a load of funny bits for you in a wheelbarrow.
[301:00.63]Just gonna dump it right over here for you.
[301:02.27]Do you like me yet?
[301:03.61]Uh, Garf craves approval.
[301:05.57]Are you looking forward to Shrek 2 remake?
[301:09.11]Why would they remake Shrek 2 before Shrek 1?
[301:14.32]Uh, do you think Garfield will be a part of it?
[301:15.88]I'll be voicing Shrek and Donkey.
[301:18.58]Phil Lord, director of 21 Jump Street, is working on the same project as Garfield since we agreed to do a scene.
[301:24.11]Would Jerm be interested in doing a part in the film, maybe a three-second camera?
[301:27.17]My favorite part about all the Garfield bits is in like a full tube, like an almost full paragraph of just word soup.
[301:35.68]There's like three lines of a question, you know?
[301:39.28]Okay, so we have like a paragraph of word soup, and then, are you excited for Shrek 2 remake?
[301:45.69]There's always something there.
[301:46.61]There's always like substance there.
[301:49.19]So, uh, I don't, I didn't even know that existed, Garfield.
[301:55.54]Thank you for the 250.
[301:59.56]He's got a, yeah, he's got a world of lore that he has.
[302:07.47]The Garfagraph sandwich technique is just, it's passed on for generations of Garfields.
[302:13.31]Guys, I hate to tell you this, and people are going to, maybe this is a sad thing to say.
[302:17.83]Garfield's cat, he's been around for like 60 years.
[302:21.19]Cats don't live 60 years.
[302:25.59]There's been like five or six Garfields.
[302:29.96]I don't, I'm... Cats only live like 15, 16, 20 plus maybe years.
[302:36.52]It's been like three or four of them.
[302:48.96]Are you insinuating that Garfield can die?
[302:51.26]I'm insinuating that an animal, a cat, which is what Garfield is, does not live on record.
[303:00.39]There's never been a cat on record that has lived past 28 years old or 30.
[303:07.74]Even if that cat, even if Garfield was the most highly living cat in the history of the world, there's been two or three of them.
[303:21.93]Oh, what about SpongeBob?
[303:23.05]SpongeBob is a sponge.
[303:24.41]They live forever.
[303:28.45]Oh no, my cup!
[303:30.84]Oh, it's only got like 15, 20, 30.
[303:32.06]No, no.
[303:32.56]What are you talking about?
[303:42.54]Like the turtle?
[303:43.92]There's a couple of turtle characters.
[303:47.78]Who's a popular turtle character?
[303:50.66]He'll be around for 150 years.
[303:55.88]Franklin the Turtle.
[303:56.64]Yeah.
[303:56.96]Franklin the Turtle is like 40.
[303:59.26]He's got like 60 or 70 to 80 more years left to go.
[304:06.95]The Ninja Turtles.
[304:07.63]Oh, that's right.
[304:08.13]The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[304:10.71]They're going to be eating pizza and cracking some skulls for like another 100 years.
[304:19.57]That's why they got bought out by Disney.
[304:40.44]Viacom.

[304:59.69]Don't worry.
[305:00.23]We're just playing.
[305:01.47]We're just playing around with the idea that you probably died six times.
[305:09.53]But thank you.
[305:09.89]Thank you, Jack.
[305:11.65]Thank you, Jack the Mac, for the $5.

[308:00.71]I know all the tricks.
[308:04.34]I know all the tricks.
[308:05.02]I'm not going to say it.
[308:09.10]Thank you for the $3.

[309:14.47]Probably not.
[309:16.07]Not in the immediate future here.
[309:18.71]There's so many other things that are going to come first.
[309:22.33]uh Etalyx played it already and he was telling me about it I'm not sure it's something that I don't know if it's something I want to do but yeah I'm not going to 100 rule it out but I'm not going to 100 rule it in either so when's the next emote contest I I don't I don't know I don't have a plan in the moment for it but that's my stance
[309:49.74]Uh, Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $2.55.
[309:50.88]Thank you, Sticks.
[309:52.82]You've heard of the comb stream.
[309:53.98]Now this spring, get ready for the shave stream.
[309:55.88]Seriously, shave on stream.
[309:57.34]No.
[309:59.00]No, I'm not going to shave on stream.
[310:00.22]I'm not, I'm not, no.
[310:01.32]No way.
[310:05.45]Hey, Pika Banana, thanks for the $2.50.
[310:06.91]Jeremy, you might have thought I was joking, but my friend is actually now going to paint his room sand-free.
[310:11.59]Thanks for answering the question.
[310:13.51]I hope that's the correct color, because I made that up.
[310:16.03]So.
[310:17.69]Here, look, look, look.
[310:18.35]I'll get, look.
[310:20.11]Let me give you a hand here.
[310:20.82]I'm going to help you.
[310:22.90]Let me give you a hand.
[310:29.20]Just bring this into Home Depot.
[310:41.41]Take a screenshot and just bring that into Home Depot.
[310:47.85]Yeah, ask him for this.
[311:00.25]You got it?
[311:01.47]Wait, I'll make it smaller.
[311:05.15]So get like a good shot of that and then get that in.
[311:24.07]Pretty good poster.
[311:25.55]Bring that in and just ask him what he thinks.
[311:28.07]Ask him what he thinks about that.
[311:30.42]Hey, what do you think about this?
[311:48.79]I'm just going to keep it like this.
[311:50.04]We're almost done.
[311:51.52]I can't fix it.
[311:52.10]It's too hard.
[311:54.16]Ask him what he thinks about this.
[311:56.08]Wait, hold on.
[312:01.17]Alright.
[312:04.99]We had Garfy the Monday Killer 250.
[312:08.27]You're mistaken, Jerm.
[312:10.37]I've died seven times.
[312:11.41]How have you died seven times?
[312:14.05]Garf is currently on his eighth life.
[312:15.72]I was a cave cat and got crushed by an Odysseus Rex.
[312:20.04]Frozen in ice as a Viking Garf.
[312:22.00]Shot in the chest as a private eye Garf.
[312:25.22]Stretched apart by a taffy puller as three stooges routine garf.
[312:30.02]Transformed into a dog in a lab and then died shortly after with problems with the mutation.
[312:34.90]Died a peaceful death in a rainbow fun land and the seventh one was an immortal cat demon that got bored and died.
[312:39.99]He's eight.
[312:49.21]Thank you.
[312:50.93]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR with five W to D subs.
[312:55.86]Thank you, the five subs.
[312:57.74]I'm looking right at you.
[312:58.58]I'm looking right at you.
[313:02.80]Take this shit into Home Depot and say, what do you think about this?
[313:13.43]You're a creep.
[313:22.66]Yeah, that's San 3.
[313:23.68]You got it.
[313:24.18]You're doing great.
[313:25.28]You're figuring it out.
[313:28.52]Alright.
[313:29.70]We're at the end of the bits.
[313:34.37]Mostly Lost Cupboard just came in.
[313:35.79]$2.50 for Mostly Lost.
[313:38.05]Well, if you're not going to shave on stream, you better damn well shave off stream.
[313:41.53]I will not.
[313:42.49]I'm going to look like this tomorrow.
[313:44.47]I don't want to.
[313:45.56]Maybe tomorrow.
[313:48.74]Hey, The Mad God, thanks for three bucks.
[313:50.60]Any chance you'll bring back some of the winners of previous rumbles like The Pencil, Captain Crunch?
[313:55.88]It'd be cool to see these legends return.
[313:58.12]And also a match between Dr. Oetker and Gabe Newell, Clash of Titans.
[314:02.19]Not sure if this sent twice or not.
[314:03.57]Good night, chat.
[314:05.19]I would.
[314:06.15]It's just in the new... I don't... Let's just fucking get this fixed.
[314:09.49]I look like a sicko.
[314:11.57]What am I doing?
[314:19.66]Okay, that's better.
[314:20.34]That's just too weird.
[314:22.72]I looked like a fucking weirdo.
[314:23.82]I looked like a weirdo.
[314:30.19]Okay.
[314:32.47]I would, but the problem is...
[314:36.65]WWE, all the ones after 2K14, not very good.
[314:41.61]They weren't good with the creative characters.
[314:46.11]You can't do as much crazy shit.
[314:47.40]You can't really make Captain Crunch in those games, no.
[314:52.28]The pencil is impossible to make in any of the new ones.
[314:55.04]And going back and making them on the old ones, they're so hard to make.
[314:59.14]When you get more than 10, 20, 30 wrestlers and you do more than 10 layers, some of those characters took hours to make just because of the loading times.
[315:06.21]So I would not go back.
[315:09.69]It would be so hard to do that.
[315:12.64]And it would make it even worse because I don't have the PlayStation 3.
[315:15.98]I don't have that PlayStation 3.
[315:17.38]So the like 40 or 50 characters I made on that 2K14, they don't exist anymore.
[315:23.06]They're gone forever.
[315:23.92]That PlayStation, I don't, I'm not in possession of it.
[315:25.60]So I don't have the save file.
[315:27.04]So I would have to remake everybody.
[315:29.18]It would take me like, it would take me a month to do that.
[315:32.94]So...
[315:36.76]Making like 75 characters in a thing that takes like an hour and a half to make a character with more than 10, 20 layers.
[315:46.65]Unfortunately, we're going to have to just let it rise.
[315:48.45]I was going to say rise.
[315:49.75]We're going to have to let it rise and I'll go get it.
[315:52.59]I'll go get it tomorrow.
[315:56.07]Do you think we'll ever see another goofy wrestling game ever again?
[315:58.29]Probably not because apparently simulations are more important than making weird characters and maybe that's just maybe that's just we have to kind of fade out here and let the default guy in underwear first name last name versus default guy in underwear first name last name is more important than a guy in a clown suit.
[316:20.28]So I don't think they care anymore.
[316:27.65]because I we need Glue Man you can still make Glue Man still you can make Glue Man still just I've seen it a couple times in the chat fix your camera before I let me fix my camera there's nothing wrong with it you didn't like those edges yeah are we good are you good
[316:58.97]Uh, get a PS3, get to, I don't even know where it is.
[317:02.69]I gave it to somebody.
[317:10.09]Is this a parrot or is this me proving why I look so bad?
[317:13.59]I feel like I'm holding a dog.
[317:17.56]Like, okay, here's my dog, guys.
[317:18.66]Yeah.
[317:19.88]It's cute, huh?
[317:22.88]Uh, Peekabinana5 community subs.
[317:25.42]Speaking of the subs, let's get them on camera here.
[317:31.31]Let's put them up.
[317:34.89]All the community subs and all the new subs and old ones, here they come.
[317:39.19]Right here.
[317:41.90]One, two, three, four, five, at least six.
[317:46.92]At least six.
[317:48.76]Thank you guys, though, for real.
[317:54.12]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[317:56.77]There are still one or two more bits to do.
[318:02.49]thank you Jack the mac for the five dollars have you ever been noticed in public before other than for charities or events happy Friday I have been noticed in public like twice very random occurrences they I don't think it'll ever happen again um but now it's happened usually happens at a convention but if I'm not at a convention it's only happened like two or three times in almost 10 years so it doesn't really happen that often
[318:32.51]It's still really interesting when it does, though.
[318:36.39]And then Zelasky, thanks for the $2.50.
[318:40.13]And they say, they say, check this out.
[318:47.24]Cream Puff the Cat was a domestic cat.
[318:51.90]She was the oldest cat ever recorded, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
[318:56.48]When she died, she was 38 years old.
[319:01.07]And then the same family had another cat that was 34 years old from the same family.
[319:11.39]You got to figure, yeah, at that point I'd be like, what were they eating?
[319:14.45]You know?
[319:15.81]That's insane.
[319:19.81]38 years old and then 34.
[319:20.67]That is impressive.
[319:28.41]But thank you for the little fact there.
[319:30.85]And then we have the five community subs in Pico Banana.
[319:32.50]And then finally, at the very end, Mass Shinobi, $3.
[319:36.84]Thanks for answering my question.
[319:39.01]But in my humble opinion, of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective, and without being condemning of one's views and trying to make it objectified, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forget what I was going to say.
[320:04.49]That's it.
[320:04.91]Thank you for the three bucks.
[320:08.38]Jess, you got it.
