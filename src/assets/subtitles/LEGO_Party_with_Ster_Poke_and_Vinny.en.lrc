[04:21.55]Mine says, like, press zero to invite.
[04:24.06]I don't know what that is.
[04:25.06]Fill in the snack table.
[04:26.30]Why is my controller not working?
[04:28.59]Oh, for fuck's sake.
[04:30.41]I just leaked the code.
[04:31.83]Did you leak the code?
[04:33.85]No.
[04:34.73]It's a brand new controller.
[04:37.66]Maybe.
[04:38.20]I don't know.
[04:38.94]Well, is this... Who's in here?
[04:41.16]Are we all in here correctly?
[04:42.81]Vinny, hurry up.
[04:44.02]I can't get in because my controller's messed up.
[04:47.28]The game doesn't detect I have a controller.
[04:50.89]Dude, I had this issue with Steam input was messing up stuff.
[04:57.79]I just disabled Steam input and games like that sometimes.
[05:02.12]I'm getting a beer.
[05:03.76]Steam input disable you?
[05:05.12]Okay, I'll try that.
[05:07.26]Yo, grab me one poke.
[05:08.25]Where's the push light, beer?
[05:09.63]Because Steam input is trying to... Push lights?
[05:12.45]Are we doing that?
[05:14.55]I'll have a beer I got I got some stuff alright the problem is the beer that I have in the fridge is like five and a half months old I don't know if that's gonna fly that's fine dude I've drank beer from a year and a half buy it one time drink a beer tell us man I'm drinking a beer and just never drink beer ever so you told us the one time you drank beer no I wait who I Jerma you're one of those guys guys I'm drinking a beer
[05:40.97]Well, I've had bush light three or four times in my entire life.
[05:47.62]How do I turn off Steam input again, guys?
[05:50.12]I'm sorry.
[05:50.80]Alright, so if you right-click on the game itself in your Steam library, and then you should be able to go to the properties for it.
[05:58.11]Go to the controller, and then it should be under there in the properties for the game itself.
[06:03.81]Disable Steam input.
[06:05.06]Okay.
[06:05.70]I'm so disappointed.
[06:07.22]I thought you were an alcoholic.
[06:09.85]I mean, I got... Actually, that worked.
[06:12.21]Yep.
[06:12.91]That worked.
[06:13.73]It's weird.
[06:14.47]Sometimes Steam Input... Because what Steam Input's trying to do is it's trying to translate your controller to keyboard presses.
[06:22.28]And if you just turn it off, it works for some stuff that has absolutely no controller support.
[06:26.95]It's good.
[06:27.97]But I would just keep it off.
[06:31.55]Yeah, some games I needed it for.
[06:33.68]Like Silent Hill, I was playing that.
[06:35.20]I kind of needed it for, but... Um...
[06:41.64]know what guys we apparently oh there's the knight helmet I gotta get that thing okay I'll be with you in a second I'm just just putting some stuff costumes you could you could put costume when you're in here really yeah I'm like 99 sure yeah yeah are you in a battlefield game right now Vinny I wish but I don't you know battlefield doesn't want to give me a code
[07:07.48]I'll buy it for you, bro.
[07:08.32]You should play with this one, John.
[07:09.18]No, no, no, no.
[07:09.54]Poke.
[07:09.80]I won't play it, dude.
[07:11.60]I won't.
[07:13.22]I won't.
[07:17.99]Battlefield.
[07:18.69]Okay.
[07:18.81]Alright, I'm ready.
[07:28.31]Join the party.
[07:29.41]I'm gonna join the party.
[07:30.39]I'm so sorry for the delay.
[07:31.89]I had my...
[07:33.63]I was playing Battlefield...

[07:47.35]Alright guys, I'm joining.
[07:51.95]Play.
[07:53.58]Join.
[07:55.94]Join the code.
[07:57.06]We should all change our name to somebody here and not tell us who's who.
[08:13.84]Wait, what resolution is this game displaying at?
[08:24.89]Okay.
[08:28.98]My controller stopped working again.
[08:31.08]Wait, it stopped working again?
[08:31.92]Yeah.
[08:34.43]What the fuck, Steam?
[08:35.63]It says I'm on...
[08:36.78]It says I'm on...
[08:37.64]It won't let me select.
[08:38.40]Do you have a keyboard, by chance?
[08:41.12]Yeah.
[08:41.24]Okay, that works.
[08:42.91]Why is it not letting me into controller?
[08:45.85]It says you're calibrating.
[08:47.27]Oh, now it's working.
[08:48.19]What the hell, man?
[08:50.26]Alright.
[08:52.88]I'm ready.
[08:54.28]Do you guys like me?

[10:26.91]It's kind of a fresh one.
[10:28.30]Oh, you can do just the rounds.
[10:29.98]Maybe we should do a small one first and then.

[11:20.10]We're just like friends.
[11:21.70]Yeah.
[11:23.24]What's that like?
[11:24.74]And our schedules are free.
[11:26.03]So we just show up and we're just like, yeah, it's game time.
[11:28.35]And then we're both there and we both have nothing else going on.
[11:30.67]And we don't have band practice.
[11:31.93]We don't need to know how to play this, right?
[11:34.45]No.
[11:38.74]I'm assuming you press one of two buttons throughout the game.
[11:41.34]I am Mr. Golden.
[11:46.21]The Twix Brothers?
[11:46.91]And I am his identical twin.
[11:54.28]Okay.
[11:54.72]Find either of us to purchase a golden brick.
[11:58.64]The golden brick.

[12:06.92]I'm Mr. Gold, how are you doing?
[12:09.91]Yeah, I know you can tell it's me because I say who I am at the beginning of the impression.
[12:13.81]Yes.

[12:32.69]Oh, yeah.
[12:35.24]Golfy!
[12:37.28]Feeling golfy!
[12:38.12]My controller isn't working.
[12:39.36]Wait, no, don't tell me that, sir.
[12:42.71]You serious?
[12:45.25]He's lying.
[12:46.53]Alright, here we go.
[12:48.04]Oh, they're going full Mario Party with this.
[12:53.12]Yes, score.
[12:55.31]Football in the hole.
[12:56.41]Wait.
[12:56.73]Okay.
[12:58.21]Wait, I'm colorblind.
[12:59.95]My shit's fucking... Why didn't that one count?
[13:04.08]Wait, this would be nice with a controller.
[13:06.74]You're not a controller?
[13:07.50]No.
[13:09.00]That's why you're hating.
[13:10.68]I'm not hating!
[13:12.85]Someone sent me to my PO Box a fucking $150 controller that has voice controls and is apparently AI-powered triggers, which no one in my chat understands and neither do I.
[13:25.92]You should get one of those and you can talk to it.
[13:29.27]What does that mean, AI-powered trigger?
[13:31.26]I don't know, Poke.
[13:31.86]I know you don't get it, but like...
[13:33.14]It's a buzzword, dude.
[13:34.24]It has to be.
[13:35.26]It doesn't mean anything.
[13:37.64]There's no fucking way that means anything.
[13:39.67]When you pull the trigger, does a...
[13:42.45]So, wait, does your controller not work and that's why you can't ready up?
[13:46.98]Oh, I'm sorry.
[13:47.84]We're readying up?
[13:50.78]Alright.
[13:51.10]It does have a prostate function.
[13:55.07]Alright, let's go.
[13:59.95]No!
[14:00.75]No way!
[14:02.43]I'll take second place.
[14:07.82]No way!
[14:08.70]Why is he going back here?
[14:09.96]Oh no.
[14:13.95]Oh no, Puff.
[14:16.49]My controller DC'd!
[14:17.81]No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[14:20.78]You should need an AI-powered controller so it can, like, pull the triggers better.
[14:25.08]Controller, win this.
[14:26.81]I was doing that bit last night.
[14:28.11]It was very funny.
[14:30.44]new move dude no Ster no what are you doing dude Ster I saw that wait who's that what do you think 100 bucks on this one oh that's Jerma because he's betting money oh man oh no oh Ster I'm taking your stars when the option comes up
[14:55.84]I can't like...
[14:58.71]I can't aim with just up, down, left, right.
[15:03.83]Go!
[15:05.28]Go!
[15:06.16]Oh, he's going, oh!
[15:14.39]Oh, that sucked.
[15:18.00]Yo.
[15:18.32]Alright, well, you fucked with me.

[15:26.77]Vinny's green.
[15:27.47]I'm blue.
[15:28.13]Yeah.
[15:29.99]You're kind of a blue guy.
[15:32.83]What?
[15:34.40]You can do that?
[15:40.86]I think you killed me.
[15:51.62]Ted Talker.
[15:54.55]yo what was the anti-aliasing msa eight four yeah six times six six times finishing position in a minigame I love that voice that's such a good voice they win but that is one of the best voices the best voices maximum unfairness oh it's one of our
[16:23.61]When you had the TTS of that rolling for a while there, it was just like a little guy next to you just talking.
[16:33.10]He would talk over you while you were talking to him.
[16:35.47]It's just completely unrelated shit, like trying to get your attention.
[16:38.81]You would sometimes just ignore it completely.
[16:40.99]It was hilarious.
[16:43.60]I love it.
[16:46.05]I feel like this reminds me of another party franchise it's a good thing switch 2 didn't need to had be had by Ster this is weird like fumble party like some of the buttons on my controller work and some don't oh this game is a tricky one good luck that's so easy you said it was a hard one some of these free stud spaces they have a little extra secret oh a secret
[17:17.66]Another player ventures off on their first turn.
[17:20.46]Okay, here we go.
[17:20.94]Boom.
[17:22.63]Don't even think about it.
[17:23.25]It's going to be either 1 through 8.
[17:25.07]Doesn't matter what it is.
[17:25.81]Present.
[17:27.07]Controller, engage prostate tickle.
[17:31.38]I roll a 6, 7, 8.
[17:35.22]There's skill to it.
[17:39.43]Watch this.
[17:41.29]Oh, nice.
[17:43.62]Oh, yeah.
[17:46.46]Is that your controller?
[17:52.79]Yeah, my controller's weird.
[17:58.52]The future is dark and full of terrors.
[18:03.50]Feels pretty good.
[18:05.33]Monkey hates.
[18:16.59]Oh, hell yeah, minigame time.
[18:18.37]Dude, I'm thrilling chill.
[18:26.90]What?

[18:41.22]Don't fall in.
[18:45.29]It's just made for kids.
[18:47.65]How did you guys die instantly?
[18:50.98]I'm ready.
[18:53.65]There's no fair when Poke has played all these.
[18:56.01]I never played this.
[18:59.00]I played a lot of Mario Party.
[19:00.30]I still lose at Mario Party.
[19:01.78]It's normal.
[19:03.04]It's fine.
[19:08.58]What?
[19:09.14]Bro, I fucked it up already.
[19:11.60]Oh my god, I switched from analog to D-pad like an idiot halfway through that.
[19:15.69]Don't do that.
[19:19.77]Princess.
[19:21.27]It lagged!
[19:24.92]What?
[19:25.94]Yeah, there's a little bit of input delay, I've noticed.
[19:29.27]You gotta do it before you do it.
[19:31.51]Yeah.
[19:34.21]Wow.
[19:35.09]Here I am giving advice and just jumping into the fucking watery abyss.
[19:39.72]I like this one.
[19:42.91]Go!
[19:53.33]No, you played chicken with me.
[19:54.78]You fucking screwed us both.
[19:57.97]We tried to turn left.
[19:58.79]It didn't turn.
[20:02.82]Man, that lag.
[20:05.67]all about the lag that performance showed us just how attentive you have to be in drill and chill oh yeah you've got to stay frosty alright one frame jokes you wouldn't suspect that our writer's room was staffed exclusively by eight-year-olds oh I actually wrote that one myself how do we turn the announcers off
[20:33.02]I gotta pull through here.
[20:35.82]Check this out.
[20:36.64]I'm not doing the voice thing.
[20:38.77]Nice.
[20:39.29]I wanted to be with all my friends.
[20:48.96]Did you turn off V in Skate, Vinny?
[20:52.52]Yeah, immediately.
[20:54.18]Immediately.
[20:56.07]Yeah.
[20:56.53]I wasn't strong enough for that.
[20:58.17]You know, if you're like AFK and come back, she's like,
[21:02.26]I hope you washed your hands.
[21:07.31]Wait, what?
[21:09.77]If you come back from being AFK, she's like, I don't know what you were doing, but I hope you washed your hands.
[21:15.52]That's really weird.
[21:17.32]How does she know?
[21:17.96]Does she watch?
[21:21.53]They fixed the glitches, both.
[21:23.09]Vinny is now...
[21:23.99]I know, I know.

[21:31.26]Yeah.
[21:33.48]will they be able to hold on to it though oh no have they greased them up again I meant someone might yeah I just I'm lowering the volume of the announcers just because like that way we can talk better and stuff I think their subtitles are covering like the whole screen for me just talk over them what are you making over here dropping frames really
[22:01.43]mute it I'm keeping them up for a little while longer up next it's player three okay well if you guys uh in Jerma's chat get sick of it let him know go to star stream if you get sick of it oh you lost debt disappointed oh it's some free stuff and a little something secret being so

[22:55.18]a DVD loading screen where it bounces into the corners there's the screen saver like I'll just end up where I end up but miss a single one maybe I get lucky and I hit a corner so put on your dance shoes because this is dance off you guys are screwed here by the way how do you I'm winning
[23:26.65]I don't think I'm winning let's yeah let's hope it doesn't get laggy it's fine drop the beat I do the same thing get on this track Vinny get on
[23:55.79]It's over for me.
[23:57.01]I burped!
[24:03.94]So many pieces are coming off of us on the left side.
[24:06.99]You're fucking with me.
[24:08.05]You're messing me up.
[24:09.81]It's a fucking sea.
[24:11.84]It's a waterfall on the left of my screen.
[24:16.02]Oh my god.
[24:18.23]Stop, please!
[24:21.35]You're failing so spectacularly!
[24:25.57]Am I doing this the opposite way?
[24:27.40]Am I doing this the opposite way?
[24:30.26]Yeah, you might be fucking...
[24:32.36]I'm dodging them!
[24:33.26]No, don't dodge them, sir!
[24:35.92]Sir, no!
[24:36.61]I was gonna get a perfect score and I see your side of the screen!
[24:40.15]It's like...
[24:41.05]The top score is over 2000 now!
[24:48.68]I thought I was doing amazing.
[24:50.90]Oh my God, dude.
[24:53.00]What were you doing?
[24:53.88]I was dodging the blocks.
[24:56.19]Is that what you thought you had to do?
[24:58.55]Yes.
[25:00.21]And you're not trolling.
[25:02.11]I'm not trolling.
[25:03.52]I would have got a perfect on that too.
[25:06.08]Fuck.
[25:06.46]Well, you can't win them all, you know.
[25:12.07]Hold shoulder buttons to dance.
[25:14.75]Okay, but on keyboard.
[25:19.63]I don't know what position, huh?
[25:23.59]77, dude.
[25:26.36]Do you not have a controller?
[25:27.14]I thought in the beginning, I was going to ask, like, how do you skip between them?
[25:30.82]Because, like, when two would line up, you know what I mean?
[25:33.39]It was, like, really hard to do the timing to get in between them.
[25:38.00]I'm paying so close attention, I just see out of the corner of my eye just a sea of blocked enemies.
[25:44.79]There's no way I could win.
[25:46.41]Standing, just standing on the left side of the screen, just watching.
[25:50.33]Like you were taking a picture of it, like you were fucking at a...
[25:53.62]I was like, this is easy, I'm getting good RNG, there's nothing on the left.
[25:58.60]Oh, my fucking face hurts.
[26:00.90]Dude, if I didn't roll a one, I would've got a star.
[26:03.31]I'm depressed.
[26:06.29]Alright, where's that star?
[26:14.54]no five I'm at the water park that's where the star is dude vinny I was dying laughing uh watching your stream when you're playing uh
[26:35.04]Some random Xbox games.
[26:36.66]I think it was called Rogue Warrior.
[26:37.93]Oh my god, dude.
[26:39.61]That shit was so funny.
[26:41.88]I'm gonna rip your fucking balls off.
[26:44.24]I'm gonna rip your fucking balls off, motherfucker.
[26:47.19]Fuck your mom, fuck your dad, fuck everything, fuck you.
[26:50.16]Go fuck yourself.
[26:52.18]It's a game on the Xbox 360 Starring Mickey Rourke And he just delivers He's probably drunk And he's just cursing And it's just a terrible first person shooter With tons of cursing And then at the end of the game when you beat it There's a rap And it's just Mickey Rourke cursing
[27:13.84]It sounds not so good in description, but it's very funny.
[27:16.96]I streamed it.
[27:17.46]I streamed it for PC a long time ago, and that was a fucking mistake.
[27:22.85]Because it wouldn't even work.
[27:24.05]I think I got to the intro screen, and the game was running so poorly, I had to switch to a different game.
[27:30.04]Oh, man.
[27:32.20]Well, I got to play some of it.
[27:34.31]Poke, did you see the other games?
[27:35.57]There were some decent ones in there.
[27:37.01]Yeah, I watched that and Leisure Suit Larry.
[27:39.22]Oh yeah, that fucking game.
[27:41.00]That was good.
[27:42.64]Yeah.
[27:43.44]There will be more.
[27:46.12]I don't know how you streamed it.
[27:47.14]I'm like, wait, how are you streaming this?
[27:48.29]And I watched it.
[27:50.13]I never played those games growing up.
[27:52.65]Neither did I, and I had a 360.
[27:55.27]Yeah, that would have ruined the development.
[27:58.54]So you have to dodge the damage circles?
[28:00.46]Is there a rap at the end?
[28:01.80]I never understood the idea of Gooner games.
[28:07.39]Like, are you...
[28:09.07]Yeah, I don't get it either, honestly.
[28:10.83]And, like, they were... That one, like, the character models are all, like, gross.
[28:15.72]I don't get it.
[28:18.54]Yeah.
[28:23.67]On Steam, though, like, any Gooner game, I don't get it.
[28:26.82]The only thing I remember at Leisure Suit Larry was...
[28:30.19]I don't know which one it's from.
[28:31.31]It's on me.
[28:31.91]My bad, guys.
[28:32.73]I don't know which one it's from, but there's a point where you get with a girl, and then your dick explodes.
[28:41.21]What?
[28:41.81]I swear to God.
[28:42.77]This is from Leisure Suit Larry.
[28:43.73]This is the only thing I remember at Leisure Suit Larry.
[28:46.97]Which laser shoots Larry's?
[28:49.53]I don't know.
[28:50.13]I just remembered that in one of them, your dick explodes.
[28:55.52]Holy shit.
[28:57.08]That sounds really awful.
[28:59.72]I don't like that.
[29:01.12]But it's supposed to be, like, comedy gooning.
[29:02.74]So, like, I get they're doing, like, comedy stuff, but it wasn't even that funny either.
[29:09.69]Yeah, I guess it's comedy gooning, yeah.
[29:12.19]Yeah, no, you're right.
[29:13.08]You're right.
[29:14.68]Someone out there...
[29:17.21]favorite game of all time was the dick explosion game how did this conversation start what I okay sir someone sent me a haunted Xbox 360 loaded with all these terrible games from back in the day like Xbox live arcade news how about Xbox One or regular Xbox and then 360 and I just played a bunch of really weird ones it was fun who doesn't love a good language onto the Xbox I love that
[29:47.40]I did a haunted PS3 as well that sounds like a good ass idea yeah the chat members are my chat I have some chat members that are very creative and they come up with good bits for my streams okay and then some other ones yeah hey always those guys I'm gonna use power up
[30:13.17]I mean, you're five to the thing, so maybe you want your high roller.
[30:17.03]Boom.
[30:17.17]Fourteen.
[30:21.20]I want this one.
[30:22.35]I have enough, right?
[30:23.55]Oh, yeah.
[30:26.84]Is your controller discharged?
[30:29.25]You just like teleport all the bricks to you or something
[30:55.64]Vinny, I'm coming in from Poke's chat because I can't tell if you have a haunted Xbox or an AI controller or if it's a masterfully crafted bit.
[31:02.63]Why am I going?
[31:03.11]I'm going again.
[31:04.93]You're choosing your path because you got to a fork in the road.
[31:09.31]And you have to choose either left or right.
[31:11.72]I don't have enough to get another one.
[31:12.80]I'm going this way.
[31:16.40]Both are real, chat member.
[31:17.72]But the controller is like bullshit buzzword AI.
[31:21.57]I don't think it's real.
[31:22.55]I don't know what that means even.
[31:26.64]Chat member, look up...
[31:32.09]Cool.
[31:38.72]Use those power-ups.
[31:42.82]BTPKP70A controller.
[31:46.39]Look up the buzzwords that it uses in advertisement and you'll see what I'm talking about.
[31:50.27]It's so weird.
[31:53.08]Speaking of controllers, I have a statement to make.
[31:58.57]What's up?
[31:59.65]The Switch 2 Pro Controller is the best controller I've ever used in my life.
[32:06.08]I really like it too.
[32:08.56]They nailed it.
[32:09.34]It's literally the controller I've always wanted my whole life.
[32:13.07]That's cool, and I believe you, but you're talking to like 10 people right now.
[32:18.24]No way!
[32:19.39]No!
[32:19.65]That's crazy, Poke!
[32:21.45]That sucks, dude!
[32:23.15]Guys, I'm freaking out.
[32:24.53]I'm throwing up on my fucking shit.
[32:27.04]Oh my god.
[32:28.10]Oh my... And you got lucky eight again.
[32:32.32]Hey, still gotta win the minigames.
[32:37.65]So, Jerm.
[32:39.37]Where am I going?
[32:40.86]Jerm, I agree with you on the Pro Controller.
[32:42.90]Pro 2 Controller, I love it.
[32:45.40]I have one problem with it, and most people seem to have the same problem.
[32:48.58]Play Tetris with it, and use the D-pad.
[32:52.02]Oh, it's the Zuck?
[32:55.09]You'll do so many wrong actions by accident, it's still an imperfect D-pad.
[33:01.40]Oh.
[33:02.00]It's the one thing.
[33:03.06]Everything else, that controller is like fucking perfect, but no, that's it.
[33:06.81]That would've been mine, sir.
[33:09.47]You don't like Tetris though, Jerma.
[33:11.01]I'm not a big Tetris fan, but I do love the grip buttons.
[33:16.26]I think it's a great place to put those.
[33:19.40]And I like the analogs, too.
[33:22.37]I like the texture of it, too.
[33:23.95]It's like a good feel.
[33:26.34]It feels good.
[33:28.02]Yeah.
[33:29.26]I like the PS5 controller.
[33:31.54]I also like the PS5 controller.
[33:33.27]May I ask you, Jerm, what games are you playing on the Switch, too?
[33:41.56]Um...
[33:43.95]Well, I was thinking maybe we were going to play Mario Party, but we're doing that kind of right now.
[33:50.92]Mario Kart World.
[33:52.19]I did get that.
[33:54.03]I actually really like it.
[33:56.51]It's fun for a while.
[33:57.77]I enjoyed it.
[33:58.60]When there's DLC, I'll definitely jump back in.
[34:01.18]Donkey Kong is good, dude.
[34:03.24]I'm just saying, I really like Donkey Kong.
[34:05.11]I actually loved it.
[34:07.86]so what's your pick for this game page if you ever want to do a Mario Party when Ster ever gets his damn switch to um or switch one I'm down I have it I thought it was traveling but it was inside of a sock drawer dude we're all zoomers we all played this right oh this is a great game oh yeah trials on the SNES NES this is a bike or like Line Rider even
[34:40.94]I put Excitebike.
[34:43.40]I loved Excitebike growing up.
[34:45.21]I was like, I always made the terrible levels and shit.
[34:50.93]Excitebike.
[34:52.34]Didn't they make another one too?
[34:53.46]It was like Excite Truck and nobody cared.
[34:58.11]Uh, yeah, Excite Truck wasn't amazing, but they did an Excitebike 64 that was quite good.
[35:04.54]Are you good?
[35:07.63]yeah the uh the keyboard button is weird it is s to go forward you just don't have the controller this is not working like Vinny I think you have to no mine's good now I think you might have to restart the game yeah but I ain't doing that I wouldn't hold my friends up
[35:34.09]You're right!
[35:35.60]That's true.
[35:36.18]Did all four players run a single tandem bike?
[35:39.52]Yeah, I guess it was kinda unfair to- Oh f- WHAT?!
[35:43.99]Nah.
[35:45.05]Crazy.
[35:45.53]They're displaying such a staggering level of precision.
[35:48.27]Get up there, you fuckin' Gramps!
[35:50.31]Come on!
[35:52.21]Like how houseflies do?
[35:53.82]See, Rams or Gramps?
[35:56.96]Uh, Gramps.
[35:57.76]Now with only ten seconds left on the clock, will the players' positions change at all?
[36:09.82]it just looks funny how you just yeah dog whatever thank you controller for the win you're getting validation from the win from your controller from the announcers from your chat this is on how did you turn the announcers off do we really care it's just the volume
[36:38.59]Are we turning off the announcers?
[36:45.70]I'm turning off.
[36:46.23]You can if you want, I turned them off.
[36:48.41]I turned it off.
[36:49.43]The influencer volume.
[36:51.19]It's a little too much.
[36:56.91]One!
[36:59.43]That scared the shit out of me.
[37:00.83]I thought the announcers were freaking out because I was turning them down.
[37:07.77]It kind of matched up when I started to put the volume down.
[37:10.55]It was like, hey!
[37:13.36]One!
[37:14.38]Yeah, like you're turning me down to one?
[37:15.64]Because when I got to one, it screamed at me.
[37:18.06]I was like, holy shit, he's mad.
[37:20.71]Chat clipped that.
[37:22.51]That's funny.
[37:29.38]That was funny.
[37:34.57]This teaches, dude, as a child, this is teaching me to gamble.
[37:37.78]I can't wait.
[37:42.04]Thanks, controller.
[37:42.72]I can't understand a word.
[37:47.25]Yeah, it's, yeah.
[37:49.65]Uh-oh.
[37:57.51]Event.
[38:04.86]Butt Stallion, remember that?
[38:06.18]That was the funniest game ever.
[38:08.98]I don't know what just happened, but apparently...
[38:12.37]I keep getting the eight thing.
[38:13.57]Why did it get rid of all of our stuff?
[38:17.13]What?
[38:17.97]Dude, I'll take a bunch of cool items.
[38:20.80]Okay.
[38:21.56]Where's the eight?
[38:22.36]I think I stole all your guys' things.
[38:24.94]Oh, all my stuff went away and you took it.
[38:27.93]Yeah, I got it.
[38:29.79]Oh.
[38:32.38]You know what?
[38:34.58]Dude, where's the freaking counterplay?
[38:38.27]Oh my god.
[38:42.41]Okay, we all got one now.
[38:43.81]This is where it gets interesting.
[38:52.22]Is the last person to get hold of a golden brick?
[38:56.17]Of course!
[38:56.83]If they were an alchemist, they could make more golden bricks.
[39:01.74]Sadly, alchemy isn't real, Todd.
[39:04.30]What a shame it would have been.
[39:06.91]Dude, if I could find money.
[39:10.07]Why did I do that?
[39:11.03]Man, Polk, you're not having a good go of it right now.
[39:13.96]I'm not thinking.
[39:14.56]No, Brian.
[39:17.30]Escalation time.
[39:18.74]Brian.
[39:19.76]This is just very Mario Party.
[39:26.53]Got battlefield brain.
[39:29.48]Beef brain.
[39:31.21]The mind sickness.

[40:48.30]You spoke too soon, Ster, because you found a minigame you don't like.
[40:52.17]No, I do like it.
[40:53.21]I'm just saying it's hard.
[40:55.49]Can I say it's hard without the hatred being fucking in my heart?
[40:59.30]Alright.
[40:59.86]Silence.
[41:02.38]Silence, he says.

[42:04.66]This isn't cool.
[42:06.11]Where am I?
[42:06.85]Ster, you're not even on the screen.
[42:15.58]Where is Ster?
[42:17.28]How did you get 131 points?
[42:17.88]Did it just put you?
[42:20.43]It just keep you... Oh, this one's hard.

[42:34.07]Get away from me.
[42:34.49]Get away from me.
[42:37.45]Get away from me.
[42:38.05]Push him off.
[42:39.10]I'm trying.
[42:43.12]Alright, alright.
[42:44.90]Truce?
[42:45.52]Truce?
[42:46.44]Truce.
[42:49.85]Truce?
[42:52.15]Oh, shit.
[43:00.81]Yeah, that one was easy.
[43:02.51]I was not trying to do that.
[43:04.75]I freaked out though.
[43:05.66]Neither was I. Oh, my God.
[43:07.72]GG, noobs.
[43:09.34]Oh, my God.
[43:14.81]Oh, Vinny, I took Loel.
[43:18.75]What do you mean?
[43:19.21]I saw it on your stream.
[43:21.18]I was like, I need that.
[43:22.82]Loel?
[43:24.40]Yeah, L-O-E-L.
[43:26.12]Oh, I'm glad you like that.
[43:28.13]That's what's up.
[43:29.49]I can do plus five.
[43:32.71]Okay, I need this.
[43:36.68]Next time I'll ask.
[43:39.18]Whatever, man.
[43:39.78]We're that close where you could just, you know, just do that.
[43:44.29]It's fine.
[43:47.55]I thought it'd make you happy.
[43:49.58]Is it 50 or is it higher?
[43:51.00]Is it still 50?
[43:55.23]How much does it cost for the star?
[43:57.57]No one knows.
[43:58.94]I didn't invent that emote either, by the way.
[44:01.82]You can have it.
[44:07.27]Do I have enough?
[44:09.77]You did.
[44:10.49]Oh, hell yeah.
[44:11.71]Let's go.
[44:12.49]God damn it, Jerma.
[44:16.16]This was my star.
[44:18.24]I got it.
[44:18.50]Why were you so close to me?
[44:19.78]I like how we're still calling them stars.
[44:24.66]It's a Mario Party mind sickness.
[44:26.74]That's a brain muscle memory to get out.
[44:28.59]It's hard to get away from that.
[44:30.59]Yeah, there's no way.
[44:33.03]You gotta call them stars.
[44:35.61]Do I have enough?
[44:36.13]I'm short.
[44:38.68]How tall are you?
[44:39.30]5'8", on a good day.
[44:43.96]Alright.
[44:46.61]I say, yeah, same here.
[44:47.55]5'8", 5'9", with dress shoes.
[44:54.04]Isn't it awesome when you put on a pair of big, thick dress shoes and you all of a sudden feel like you're six feet tall?
[45:00.59]Dude, I have these shoes that make me taller.
[45:02.93]They're awesome.
[45:06.78]I don't know your height.
[45:07.96]How tall are you, Star?
[45:09.48]Guess.
[45:10.52]What kind of energy do I give up?
[45:12.41]5'10".
[45:16.47]No.
[45:18.12]6'2".
[45:19.80]You're that tall?
[45:20.54]He's tall.
[45:23.17]Jerma, you met him, right?
[45:25.51]I've met him once before.
[45:28.07]Well, maybe twice even.
[45:31.38]He is 6'2".
[45:32.88]I typed Ster height and the AI overview says star height can refer to the maximum depth of nested clean stars in a regular expression.
[45:45.35]Dude, I'm taller than you if we fucking measure me girth-wise.
[45:50.22]Like belly height from laying down.
[45:55.30]Path flip.
[45:58.20]How tall is Vinny?
[46:00.23]Um, I'm six foot.
[46:02.07]It's what it says on my license, but I might also be 5'11".
[46:04.75]Damn, you're lucky.
[46:09.44]Not as lucky as Ster over here.
[46:11.02]This guy's a fucking Gigachad.
[46:13.69]If I get on a pair of dress shoes, and I'll, I don't know if Poke can do this, but if I start, like, snapping my fingers and shit, I'm like, whoa.
[46:20.08]Look at how big I am now.
[46:24.19]Put a suit on, just kind of like snapping around.
[46:26.41]Dude, when you feel taller, the world's like different.
[46:28.25]It's so crazy.
[46:30.28]If you have someone like walk around with you and carry you around like a little bit higher, you'll see everything from a new perspective.
[46:37.95]How does this one work?
[46:40.01]You need to throw your sword to get the highest score.
[46:44.81]I think, I guess we just...
[46:47.28]Okay, I get it.
[46:48.62]I wish the wheel was not 20 FPS.
[46:51.32]yeah I don't know maybe it will be better no practice okay and we get four swords that's a good game that's a good ass game for us dude I would play that I never played as a kid I always wanted to play it I was I never got to it's good wait did I miss two what the fuck was that how did I miss two can you even miss
[47:23.17]yeah my sword like maybe you hit the back of other people's swords oh there's times and plus it's like balatro yeah oh he can't sword another sword oh no okay I get it now oh there's a times two on there oh my god I I gotta really pull it there's a divided by two be careful
[47:57.24]I gotta divide it by two.
[47:58.92]Fuck.
[48:00.92]Oh my god, I'm at 27 points.
[48:03.36]What happened?
[48:03.87]Yo, did something happen to the lag?
[48:07.41]Alright, never mind.
[48:11.18]Okay, that one took one to figure out what the hell's even going on.
[48:18.95]Great job, Poke.
[48:19.91]Like, honestly, you fucking earned it.
[48:22.03]I never played that one before.
[48:23.31]Like, I can't even be mad, dude.
[48:24.66]Like, you're honestly...
[48:28.74]You were really doing good in Battlefield today too, man.
[48:30.94]Like you're just killing it.
[48:32.39]Thank you.
[48:32.97]It's my day.
[48:37.21]What's the best gun in Battlefield right now?
[48:41.08]Oh man, where do I start?
[48:42.38]The P90 is pretty good.
[48:45.44]The P90.
[48:46.68]KV9 is pretty good.
[48:47.78]I've only ever used the MP5, so I don't know.
[48:53.25]And sometimes I look over at pokes chat and they're like laughing at me that I haven't switched guns yet.
[48:58.48]Okay, um, that was like a goofy rhetorical kind of question I didn't actually want you guys to answer, and it seemed like you were really, really gung-ho about answering that.
[49:05.44]Okay, well then I'm done talking to you for the night.
[49:07.49]I don't even know what these guys are talking about.
[49:09.43]I really enjoy using the assault class with my ladders.
[49:11.99]The ladders are the best part of the game.
[49:13.63]Yeah, you gotta use the ladders.
[49:16.42]It's actually, okay, so they gave you this ladder in the game, but it's so goofy that you can do stupid shit with it and bug it out.
[49:21.78]And it's just really fun.
[49:23.90]I fucking wish it didn't come out when so many other games were out.
[49:26.45]Are you gonna get it right now?
[49:27.47]No, you're not.
[49:29.15]These past few months, I've been just gaming so hard.
[49:31.84]I know, you've been live a lot.
[49:32.94]Every time I go live, or like in the afternoon, you're like always live.
[49:40.00]There's just so many fucking games, dude.
[49:43.01]Name one.
[49:44.01]Name one.
[49:45.39]Cultic.
[49:46.05]Check out a game called Cultic.
[49:48.05]It's a first-person shooter.
[49:49.27]It's like Resident Evil 4 first-person shooter.
[49:51.66]It's like classics.
[49:53.10]It's awesome.
[49:53.38]Wait, really?
[49:53.80]Yeah.
[49:54.94]Oh, I wasn't that fucked in the game.
[49:56.82]It's good.
[49:57.79]that sounds sick I'll check that one out yeah that's a great like boomer shooter game um I mega bonk ball x pit Final Fantasy tactics remaster is awesome yeah withering realms yeah I just got ball x pit I want to try that one dude arc raiders tomorrow I'm going to be in I'm oh god that's tomorrow you gotta play yes tomorrow I'm gonna play it but I didn't know it was tomorrow it's a free play test tomorrow and then the real release is end of the month
[50:23.81]I don't think Wuthering Realms is doing a playtest.
[50:26.34]Wuthering Realms is another one coming, I think.
[50:28.20]What is that, Jerm?
[50:30.98]It's by a solo developer.
[50:33.85]It's kind of a weird game.
[50:35.17]It's like Clock Tower.
[50:36.53]Well, the first one's like Clock Tower, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls mixed together.
[50:41.18]This one's not a sequel.
[50:42.38]It's kind of in the same universe.
[50:43.86]Looking forward to it.
[50:44.48]It's coming out around Halloween, what I think.
[50:48.15]Wuthering Realms.
[50:50.03]Oh my god, I was not paying attention.
[50:53.02]Yeah, I just realized the middle is a circle.
[50:57.03]No, I couldn't even afford it anyways.
[51:01.01]Cool.
[51:02.86]I'll have a look at that.
[51:04.16]It got delayed?
[51:05.44]No, it didn't.
[51:06.76]Oh, it got delayed.
[51:09.53]Mina the Hollower just got delayed.
[51:11.65]That was like a Zelda Link to the Past or Link's Awakening kind of game.
[51:19.20]I gotta play Link to the Past again.
[51:20.74]It's been so long.
[51:23.50]Q2 2026.
[51:24.14]That might be...
[51:26.80]I think you're talking about when it's actually...
[51:28.02]I think it's going into early access in like a month.
[51:30.47]And he plans on releasing it, I think, Q2 2026.
[51:33.11]I don't think it's been delayed.
[51:35.64]Sorry, Vinny.
[51:36.08]You're pretty Q2.
[51:41.04]Ster's never played Zelda.
[51:44.43]I think you would like it.
[51:45.27]I don't... Well, you know what?
[51:46.65]I played a brief amount of... No, I stream Breath of the Wild.
[51:49.09]I just didn't play the old ones.
[51:52.27]I don't know if that's a thing like growing up with them made me such a fan but I know people who have played Zelda later in life and also like them so Link to the Past is like my third favorite game of all time so I would recommend that one and it's just really good crazy take I didn't like Breath of the Wild that much but I love Zelda
[52:21.23]I enjoyed it.
[52:21.99]I know it's a good game, it just didn't get me that much.
[52:26.10]I loved everything about it except for the controller.
[52:31.00]Everyone get mad at me, it's fine.
[52:32.71]What did you use to play it?
[52:36.15]Pro Controller or the Joy-Con?
[52:37.63]I think I ended up using an emulator.
[52:41.50]I might have used the Xbox controller towards the end.
[52:47.33]don't recall I think I had the normal weed dual wielding yeah I hated when games started going open world not everything needs to be open world like I'm seriously over that like I like a nice 10 hour long game if it's really well done like you know yeah and Breath of the Wild came out when that was happening and I was like yeah I'm not into it
[53:13.09]You know what?
[53:14.07]I just like a streamlined, linear story.
[53:16.71]I just like that.
[53:18.59]That's the thing.
[53:19.14]Yeah, like my life.
[53:19.96]It's more relatable.
[53:22.02]I loved Breath of the Wild, but I'll probably not return to those games for like two decades.
[53:27.59]I'll be 60 by the time I play them again, if ever.
[53:30.63]But I can go back to Link to the Past or Link's Awakening or Ocarina like once every two or three years.
[53:37.99]Yeah.
[53:39.41]yeah I my opinion is you're saying it's a good it's okay some people are saying uh our career of time is open world kind of I get it yeah a little bit it's a little bit kind of like I don't think I can make any money I want low
[54:00.12]Yeah, but Majora's Mask was my favorite.
[54:01.98]That one was... Yeah.
[54:04.16]No, that's a great game.
[54:06.29]I love that game.
[54:06.77]The best one.
[54:07.05]It's just like... Oh, everyone's getting ones.
[54:10.07]You know what that is?
[54:11.47]It's like vibe maxing.
[54:13.74]I'm just making up shit, but that's what it is.
[54:17.86]It's so spooky, too.
[54:19.75]He has enough to buy it.
[54:28.38]I say I liked Breath of the Wild.
[54:29.88]I didn't love Breath of the Wild.
[54:31.91]I was like, that was, I enjoyed that experience, but I don't think I want to have that experience again.
[54:37.94]And then Tears of the Kingdom was like, you will have this experience again and you will pay a lot for it.
[54:42.76]And then I did and I enjoyed it again.
[54:45.21]They drag out the experience so much that it's overwhelming to start over.
[54:49.83]You start with nothing.
[54:50.59]You got to like get your ability to build up and stuff.
[54:53.18]You know, it's not just, you know.
[54:54.94]I've never played it.
[54:55.88]It's big out there.
[54:58.20]Jerma Majora is great.
[55:00.38]There's a PC decomp and mods for it, HD texture packs.
[55:04.91]It is a very special game.
[55:07.31]Jeremy never played it?
[55:08.69]It might not click with you, but if it clicks with you, it's so good.
[55:13.61]I would try it.
[55:14.26]I 100%ed it on the PC recently.
[55:16.58]I'll put it after.
[55:18.04]I've got about 70 SEGA CD games to play, so it'll be after that.
[55:23.78]Majora's has such good vibes.
[55:26.29]Would you have money?
[55:27.90]give me three you know I'll go here okay oh there's only one more round I guess so wait there is oh it was 10 rounds minigame mode I think you guys like minigame one more that one's one we could do that too
[55:59.74]Yeah, this felt fast.
[56:04.11]Painting.
[56:10.11]Graffiti mode for the tiny hawk.
[56:12.56]Squid kid.
[56:16.68]He's gonna follow one person.
[56:17.76]I have a strap.
[56:20.58]He's gonna follow a star and ruin it.
[56:22.31]I got a strategy here.
[56:23.39]Fuck, dude.
[56:26.83]Hey, why did it stay?
[56:27.89]Yeah, why did it?
[56:28.53]It's weird.
[56:29.71]Oh.
[56:38.46]What the heck?
[56:39.50]Oh, there's items.
[56:53.96]What the fuck?
[56:56.14]Where's the counter play?
[56:59.31]Oh, I got nothing.
[56:59.95]You guys motherfucked me.
[57:01.31]You motherfucked me so last second.
[57:05.66]Good.
[57:07.06]Whoever gets the big mode just wins.
[57:11.41]I didn't get the big mode.
[57:15.99]So you're disproven.
[57:18.06]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[57:18.82]Dude, banana peel.
[57:31.54]I'd say this is a pretty high quality game.
[57:33.51]I like it.
[57:34.43]I like it a lot, actually.
[57:40.24]Yeah.
[57:40.36]Can you get rid of your power-ups?
[57:41.80]Like, I don't even want these.
[57:57.12]Handy.
[58:02.29]Where are you guys?
[58:05.55]Don't worry about it.
[58:15.33]What?
[58:20.18]Clown.
[58:32.02]Wait, turn's gonna win!
[58:33.40]Turn just won!
[58:36.05]No, you're not calculating the shithead stars at the end.
[58:41.28]I don't think the game has shithead stars.
[58:42.38]Oh, right, the fuck face stuff, yeah.
[58:48.11]Oh wait, they might not be shithead stars.
[58:50.75]Oh man.
[58:53.95]Oh no, the stairs are gonna win.
[58:56.66]Yeah, a lot of people, like, don't rely on the shithead stars at the end.
[59:08.91]Wait, Jeremiah's right in front of one.
[59:11.66]Yeah, I have an opportunity, but I will have less coins.
[59:22.77]Thirteen or eight.
[59:25.23]Oh, man.
[59:33.50]Oh, nice.
[59:34.15]Okay.
[59:35.11]Yeah, but this is the last round, right?
[59:37.55]Oh, I found a secret.
[59:38.78]when I was a young lad I had a really fun time building lego boats and I would put them in the sink and like try and make floatable boats and then I put all my legos away and they got mold yuck I don't know why I reacted to that so strongly no it was gross did you do the lego pirate ships or just regular boats
[60:04.28]um I don't think I never had any of like the special sets I'm like a classic block type of person yeah I did like the lego floor well there's the third one except I have way less coins or whatever they are I feel like enjoying classic blocks is like not accepting that there's more than 150 Pokémon
[60:34.21]I mean, if you can use your imagination that vividly, I couldn't because my brain was damaged.
[60:39.38]So I had to have the night medieval set, the pirate set, the space set with the orange transparent chainsaws.
[60:47.54]How many Pokémon are there now?
[60:50.48]Almost a thousand.
[60:51.58]985?
[60:56.77]That's crazy.
[60:58.60]Over a thousand.
[61:08.79]when they get to a thousand they need to make who's the first Pokémon ever the chat says it's over a thousand thousand ninety six a Squirtle number one or like was it Bulbasaur when I was a kid I opened a pack of cards uh that I won on the jersey shore boardwalk and one of them was a golden holographic Charizard and then I was a dumb kid and I bent it and my brother got really mad and he punched me in the face god
[61:36.79]wow that hurts why did you bend it were you bending it on purpose like I got your Pokémon card no no I don't I don't even remember what I did it was definitely not on purpose also I opened the pack it was I thought it was mine the rock paper claw what I think we okay
[62:09.00]but do we have to beat each other and so I get it yeah okay it hides it I see oh okay I got you caught me at the corner because I had to grow up okay that's actually
[62:34.72]what I don't know how did you not hit him that he looked like he ran right he just juked me like it was AFK I tried to gazelle you I've never heard the expression gazelle oh come on I thought you're gonna
[63:07.96]How did you do that to me?
[63:09.99]No!
[63:10.65]He's on the keyboard.
[63:15.10]I was hardened from a young age.
[63:21.83]Come on.
[63:22.59]I... Are you guys... Is that collusion?
[63:26.72]Yeah.
[63:26.94]What was that?
[63:27.74]That was collision.
[63:28.48]Let's all run to the center.
[63:36.65]How did you possibly get away?
[63:38.89]Yeah.
[63:44.48]Wow.
[63:45.44]Your ass was trying to get me the whole time I saw your ass.
[63:49.03]Stop chasing the fox.
[63:57.48]What the fuck?
[63:58.38]I had nowhere to go.
[63:59.17]Dead by daylight.
[64:13.44]My dude's just glitching.
[64:21.99]I don't know how to play it.
[64:29.62]We get one more.
[64:31.20]Oh man.
[64:34.63]Oh boy, I don't have enough.
[64:36.21]This is the last chance, yeah.
[64:41.52]You can't do it to the middle.
[64:46.90]Can you imagine them playing Dead by Daylight?
[64:48.64]Is that the game where you jump through windows and smash through windows and stuff as the survivor?
[64:52.67]You walk in circles around boxes, I think, is the whole game.
[64:57.84]But there's DLC boxes.
[65:00.42]People who are running away from things play that game.
[65:06.05]Yeah, it doesn't work for me at all.
[65:07.67]That whole type of horror game.
[65:09.58]Yeah, I don't like it.
[65:11.89]Yeah, I'm better off playing just single player horror, or like Phasmophobia is genuinely pretty scary.
[65:18.34]Yeah.
[65:19.08]In VR?
[65:21.43]Yeah, dude.
[65:22.05]That game scared the shit out of me.
[65:23.81]There's a game on VR called Cosmodread, I think I told you about, but I just did it again last week.
[65:28.44]It was awesome.
[65:29.90]We gotta do Phasma in VR, all of us.
[65:33.54]I think that'd be fun.
[65:34.52]We've done that once before, Vinny, and I remember your device kept making a...
[65:40.15]It was the weirdest thing ever.
[65:45.36]Holy shit.
[65:45.94]Wait.
[65:47.38]Oh.
[65:48.40]Oh.
[65:53.63]Hang on, guys.
[65:55.97]I want to check the map.
[66:00.06]I want to check the map.
[66:01.06]I want to check the map.
[66:03.34]uh come on come on I have no chance oh that's what the path flip does that's what I said on my turn oh the clown scared me someone said there's a ufo type phasmo game currently on um on steam
[66:31.51]It's in VR.
[66:32.57]What's the name of that?
[66:45.84]We're going to be close.
[66:53.59]Eufolia?
[66:54.37]Oh, that's awful.
[66:55.31]That's an awful name.
[66:56.67]Eufolia.
[66:58.11]Eufolia.
[66:58.77]That's the name?
[67:00.67]Wait, that's the name of it?
[67:02.29]Dude, Vinny, I beat you.
[67:04.07]I beat you by five coins.
[67:06.22]Fuck.
[67:09.38]Ster has beaten us both by many more coins.
[67:14.06]I'm done.
[67:17.07]Oh, poke just ended stream.
[67:19.33]Oh, fuck.
[67:22.27]He left the Discord group.
[67:26.62]He deleted his Twitch.
[67:27.84]He blocked me on Twitter.
[67:32.33]Holy shit, what the fuck?
[67:37.53]Dude, he blocked me on Xbox Live.
[67:40.50]How the fuck did you do that that quick?
[67:44.79]I don't have him as a friend anymore on Switch.
[67:49.25]Oh.
[67:49.51]I'm back.
[67:51.28]Oh, hey, Poke.
[67:51.92]Oh, he re-added me.
[67:54.42]Sorry, I had a little tantrum.
[67:57.44]Apparently, we could have stolen stars from each other.
[68:02.57]I think we played this map wrong and just went around the circle in the middle the whole time.
[68:06.75]That's all I did.
[68:07.99]We said just walk around in the middle the whole game.
[68:13.94]I didn't.
[68:17.46]That's so stupid.
[68:21.83]We kind of were just talking.
[68:23.75]Now you have to acknowledge me.
[68:26.72]Man, I wish there were fucked face breaks.
[68:28.78]Good job.
[68:30.36]Nice job, sir.
[68:32.20]Yeah, where's the fuckface bricks, like, winning the most challenge, like, party games?
[68:35.70]Yeah, landing on the most bad, you know, red spots and...
[68:39.16]Complaining the most.
[68:41.37]Is that a, um... Is that a setting we can do where we get fuckface bricks?
[68:47.13]I don't think so.
[68:47.65]Chad, is there a fuckface setting?
[68:56.16]This game's fun.
[69:00.38]It's already on?
[69:01.81]Huh.
[69:11.59]Awesome.
[69:12.53]You got carrot points.
[69:23.44]Okay.
[69:23.98]That was cool.
[69:25.78]Apparently, um, the pirate blend goes kind of quick, but I mean, it's up to you guys.
[69:31.27]If you want, I just want to do a temperature check as usual.
[69:34.25]Vibe check.

[70:38.18]Oh, I had to look.
[70:39.31]Okay, it looked weird.
[70:40.49]My bad.
[70:42.19]I don't know why I never noticed it like that.
[70:46.24]How could I be in the audience and in the game at the same time?
[70:48.38]That's weird.
[70:50.19]There's a lot of me in the audience.
[71:05.49]green hexagon did you ever shift in your chair and you realize that your ass hurts a lot in that specific place because you feel like you haven't moved in at least an hour yeah whenever we play Nightreign you know can anyone move this I set my thing to controller and now it won't I can't do anything
[71:33.86]Oh, there it is.
[71:34.60]I was not clicked in.
[71:35.86]Yeah.
[71:36.76]Minigame Rush.
[71:39.41]Minigame Rush.
[71:40.31]Yeah, Rush.
[71:41.69]I like that.
[71:42.23]Minigame Random Rush.
[71:45.28]How are we feeling about Random Rush?
[71:47.80]Yeah.
[71:48.08]Okay, Random Rush.
[71:49.20]Okay, I just alphaed.
[71:50.34]Minigames, 15.
[71:53.17]Yeah.
[71:57.33]Unlimited surprises await, and it's just 15 rounds.
[72:01.88]Okay.
[72:03.44]Yeah.
[72:05.11]ah if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all oh king of the hill with uh we're on two teams with Bobby who's with who okay um Ster and I oh Vinny I'm so sorry you're with me Ster can you move at all wait so what do we need to pick some stuff up or Ster yeah yeah go into the middle go into the middle
[72:35.28]Alright, Poke, I think you and I have to press up together at the same time.
[72:38.23]They're killing us.
[72:40.17]Okay, I'm back.
[72:41.16]I had to...
[72:42.24]I had to pee.
[72:44.62]Alright, Poke, it's you and me in a tank.
[72:47.49]Okay.
[72:47.89]And we both have to hit up together at the same time to go forward.
[72:52.16]I want you, right when the round starts, to think about Wildwood, New Jersey.
[72:55.80]I'm thinking about it.
[72:56.84]I've been thinking about it since you mentioned it.
[72:58.51]I want you to be the main driver here, and when you want to go forward, I want you to say, go.
[73:04.44]I don't think we should even say anything.
[73:06.04]We understand the car.
[73:08.80]The Pokémon cards that I got from the Jersey Shore were from Point Pleasant.
[73:13.65]I'm sorry.
[73:14.71]Oh, no, that is where I got them.
[73:16.45]Oh, shit, that's weird.
[73:17.71]I was a Point Pleasanter.
[73:20.31]I was mainly Wildwood, but Point Pleasant was a lot closer.
[73:40.49]Nice.
[73:40.65]Puck, you and I are just feeling this car big time.
[73:43.11]We are literally a car.
[73:44.45]Our brain cells are not working here together.
[73:46.98]I see where it was messed up.
[73:49.18]Nice job, Puck.
[73:50.43]What do you mean?
[73:51.37]We are a car.
[73:52.69]I got turned around and I wasn't looking at the forward arrow on the car.
[73:58.14]Yeah, I picked up literally everything you put down there, folk.
[74:00.99]We were totally in tune.
[74:02.97]God damn it.
[74:04.25]That's fine.
[74:04.73]I'm sabotaging Vinny because he's my only real competition.
[74:08.66]We're on the same team, dog.
[74:10.42]Oh, no, we're not.
[74:12.95]Screw you.
[74:16.97]like the song is bumping okay this time I'm not looking at anybody on my left Ster do you ever go to Seaside heights and try the fro the uh fried kool-aid he's next to me oh I've never even heard of that but I've been to Seaside a bunch too they had fried kool-aid it's just like the packets of kool-aid and they put it in a deep fryer
[74:41.39]You guys ever have frozen hot chocolate?
[74:43.19]What does that do?
[74:45.31]Doesn't that just make the fryer boil over?
[74:48.16]It sounds horrible, but it's something that they do, yeah.
[74:53.38]Whoever wins this is the best gamer in the world.
[75:08.06]My computer lagged.
[75:29.64]Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[75:39.79]Get over here.
[75:50.54]I will not lose.
[76:03.08]I missed one then yeah for some reason I was holding left and then when I let go of left it did not leave it stayed on the left side for like a half second because you have a bunch of crust in your analog dude up have you been leaking into your controller I was doing okay chat I almost got an fc what they call it in the guitar hero community a full clear
[76:35.50]You guys remember those YouTubers?
[76:37.84]It was like those YouTubers back in the day.
[76:40.19]Oh, this controller has to charge.
[76:43.67]Okay, it's good.
[76:44.25]It's done.
[76:44.55]It was prostate smashing.
[76:45.79]Go ahead.
[76:46.09]What was up?
[76:49.84]What YouTubers back in the day?
[76:56.45]He muted.
[76:57.89]Damn.
[76:59.27]Just ruined his whole bit.
[77:02.04]No, I was muted.
[77:04.05]Gigi was asking about what's that robot noise, and I had to tell her it's Vinny's controller.
[77:08.35]It's so weird that every time you press a button, it yelps out in pain.
[77:16.07]It does.
[77:16.53]It doesn't like it.
[77:17.31]It's the future of controllers.
[77:20.37]Like when you press and hold, essentially you're pushing in his eyes.
[77:25.62]Jerma.
[77:30.97]Can I tell you what that actually is?
[77:32.73]What is that?
[77:33.43]It's a thing I got at a gacha machine from Comic-Con.
[77:36.54]It's like a little megaphone that you talk into and it just makes you robot.
[77:40.62]I forgot who was what fucking icon, by the way.
[77:44.07]But I have a feeling.
[77:44.89]Granny!
[77:46.17]Dude, I touched Granny three times.
[77:49.51]Don't clip that out of context.
[77:51.78]Do not clip that.
[77:54.12]Clip it.
[77:58.54]oh my god four times okay sir come down here let's work together dude you guys are throwing this it doesn't make any sense what you're doing okay Vinny let's work together meet in the middle let's talk

[78:37.57]Fuck you, grandma!
[78:40.13]Yes.
[78:41.31]Ow!
[78:42.51]What are you doing?
[78:44.66]What's wrong with you?
[78:49.50]Dude, Jerma, you kept coming into my lane and you were just feeding.
[78:58.75]I'll take second place still what does that mean Ster wait wait I'm confused oh this one looks cool already smarty I said it once and I'll say it again Dr. pepper strawberry strawberries and cream zero s tier okay I'll try it I love Dr. pepper oh man zero sugar though
[79:28.38]zero sugar the zero sugar one tastes insane I don't know why alright we don't want to get answers here if you're done wait what is it how do you play this yeah it's a question it's trivia just guess where you think the art is from artistic question time what okay sir
[79:58.59]Oh, the speed matters.
[79:59.71]Oh, I didn't have to click it.
[80:03.53]I thought I was going to bait someone into Normsville.
[80:06.78]Normsville?
[80:08.30]No Armsville, nor, I don't know.
[80:20.31]I'm winning.
[80:40.44]I think I'll take the W on this one.
[80:44.22]You don't know Johan's like I do.
[80:47.51]Johan's.
[80:49.15]How did I lose?
[80:53.23]I was first every time.
[80:59.14]No, not the first one.
[81:00.34]What?
[81:00.76]Sorry, dog.
[81:06.23]The graphics with the gears.
[81:07.88]I'm falling behind, man.
[81:09.34]I'm embarrassing myself.
[81:20.90]Fly through rings and lanterns.
[81:24.36]Is this flappy?
[81:24.93]No, it's ain't flappy.
[81:26.37]Hey, how do these controls work?
[81:27.91]Which one's me?
[81:28.31]It's flappy.
[81:28.81]It gives the controls on the side, dude.
[81:31.38]It's kind of flappy.
[81:33.36]It's a little flappy.
[81:43.70]Alright, we got it.
[81:45.55]No more practice.
[81:52.81]Get out of my way!
[82:24.93]Fuck, I think we all have the same idea.
[82:26.91]Fast is not always better.
[82:35.26]Oh, you get points for if you go right in the middle?
[82:37.31]No.
[82:39.49]I think I might have just fucking at the very end cleaned up there.
[82:42.98]Yeah, you, yeah.
[82:44.96]Oh my god, Vinny, holy shit.
[82:47.08]How?
[82:47.48]What?
[82:48.64]I don't even know how I did that.
[82:49.61]I thought I was eating shit.
[82:52.25]nah it makes no sense vinny's been cheating his controller can do it for him he just says controller witness minikey uh-oh okay got interesting real quick
[83:13.99]alright Vinny you gotta do a thing where you start to get angry at it and you like squeeze it really hard and then you change the other voice and say like ow ow ow and say fuck you controller switch between the voices be a good bit oh wait who's on my team Vinny again?
[83:31.74]Yeah, green.
[83:35.60]I'm blue.
[83:36.55]This game looks like something I would have played for 600 hours and no one would like it.
[83:44.20]Dude, I would go all in on this shit.
[83:46.58]Yeah, I'm learning.
[83:48.63]I see Ster games.
[83:54.03]Come on, grandma.
[83:55.10]Let's go.
[83:56.36]I'll be defense.
[83:57.22]I'll be defense.
[84:00.51]okay never mind I guess I messed up nice people would have to hear what I say I guess oh I'll go bottom
[84:28.10]Combo that shit.
[84:29.48]Oh, shit.
[84:29.82]Yeah.
[84:31.82]That was intentional.
[84:33.13]The controls are so hard.
[84:35.89]Oh, that was beautiful.
[84:37.39]Absolutely stunning.
[84:38.69]That's penis.
[84:42.81]No, get it.
[84:51.94]Oh, my God, Jerma.
[84:53.75]You're all pretty good.
[84:55.96]Hey, Lawton, you're doing great.
[84:57.90]There it is.
[84:58.78]Aw, dude, I could play that for an hour.
[85:01.29]That was good.
[85:01.71]Yeah, that was a good one.
[85:11.34]Okay.
[85:17.81]Yeah, he's still in first.
[85:18.75]Alright.
[85:19.41]Yeah, somehow.
[85:21.99]Some way.
[85:23.06]We're about to do x2 score, so it's going to get wacky.
[85:25.47]This is Family Feud.
[85:26.63]The last question is what matters.
[85:33.10]Build a monster.
[85:34.94]We have to build Weggos.
[85:39.17]Solve the puzzle.
[85:39.87]What is the puzzle?
[85:40.33]Are you using your mouse?
[85:43.00]No, I'm on controller.
[85:46.50]Wait, what does it want us to do?
[85:47.72]You just have to put everything on.
[85:50.55]You can't even use your mouse.
[85:52.47]Is there any rotating?
[85:54.35]This is fucked.
[85:55.47]I'm so screwed.
[85:56.57]I'm going to have a problem with this one for sure.
[85:59.08]I'm not good at this stuff.
[86:02.62]Whatever.
[86:04.61]Can you rotate?
[86:07.05]No rotate.
[86:08.23]Uh-oh.
[86:09.45]Oh, that's a problem.
[86:12.02]Hey, C in last place because that's where I'm going to be.
[86:16.18]I got it.
[86:17.23]Actual IQ test.
[86:21.69]Oh, boy, I feel stupid.
[86:27.08]Hi, we got we got to go for it.
[86:29.76]I hope I don't know how you got that because my brain is not comprehending or computing this.
[86:34.69]I can't do it either.
[86:38.09]You just got it.
[86:38.67]Oh, it's me.
[86:40.47]Oh, my God.
[86:41.07]It's always me.
[86:42.40]Oh, yeah.
[86:43.32]It's not just me.
[86:44.40]I know.
[86:45.26]Just OK.
[86:46.19]See, Vinny, the longer that it takes for us to practice, the more embarrassing people it is for us.
[86:49.71]You know what I mean?
[86:51.08]Yeah.
[86:54.18]Yeah, let's not practice anymore.
[86:55.81]Let's just win.
[86:56.87]It's time to win.
[86:59.63]Gigabrain.
[87:06.36]Hello.
[87:07.11]Diatroderma.
[87:18.47]Huh?
[87:20.03]Oh, no.
[87:24.34]This one's weird as fuck.
[87:26.46]This one is a butthole.
[87:28.48]This one feels like you're supposed to be able to rotate.
[87:31.13]Fuck, man.
[87:32.77]Wait.
[87:37.62]I don't know.
[87:38.82]It's doable.
[87:42.14]What if you get it 80% right?
[87:43.72]What the fuck?
[87:46.77]Do it, guys.
[87:47.27]I believe in you.
[87:49.28]What is it, man?
[87:50.83]Legos.
[87:51.67]This is babies.
[87:52.79]Babies do this every day.
[87:54.61]Toddlers become adults playing Legos like this.
[88:01.64]Bruh.
[88:02.78]I'm filtered.
[88:08.88]I'm filtered.
[88:09.72]I'm filtered so hard right now.
[88:10.79]I'm filtered.
[88:11.23]I am too.
[88:12.79]Oh, fuck.
[88:13.35]Vinny, stop moving.
[88:14.66]I'm not sure I can unfilter myself here because this is getting nuts.
[88:19.57]I can't.
[88:24.20]This last one is, yeah, it's like, what do you mean?
[88:28.80]One of those.
[88:29.26]Is anyone going to solve it?
[88:33.59]What am I doing?
[88:38.56]What do you mean?
[88:43.46]Gamers.
[88:49.33]We're struggling gamers.
[88:50.65]Fuck.
[88:54.67]Dude, I...
[89:00.08]I'm so close.
[89:06.89]There's just no way.
[89:08.47]I'm just filtered.
[89:09.83]Vinny, dude, sir, what is it, man?
[89:11.59]Why do you do it?
[89:13.09]I haven't done it.
[89:15.30]you're asking the wrong guy just keep taking pieces out and and like learn where they don't go I know that doesn't help but that was like I want to rotate so bad you just have to like take note of like okay that's that's that's not
[89:35.66]Fuck this.
[89:40.19]You got it.
[89:41.35]I'm telling you, you can do it.
[89:42.41]It's possible.
[89:43.98]I have to finish it.
[89:45.76]I have to finish it.
[89:46.54]There's no way.
[89:53.15]Oh, I had it right there at the end.
[90:00.90]Why don't we just get a fucking IQ test?
[90:03.19]Yeah.
[90:05.72]Smack me off the fucking ledge.
[90:13.47]We just gotta kill Vinny.
[90:15.89]Wait, what?
[90:17.43]It's alright.
[90:18.13]The curve of our collective IQ in the group, we had a 150 IQ and then the three zeros.
[90:25.40]So we're averaged out to about 40.
[90:32.30]wild that they actually get rewarded for failing completely so is it one of my chat members it's crazy wait what's that a locks um oh okay I see yeah this is this is a do you know the buttons of your controller by heart or not I I have to look down because every controller I play has different buttons I know it's so frustrating
[91:00.95]Alright, let's do it.
[91:01.91]No more practice.
[91:07.96]Focus!
[91:08.58]Focus up!
[91:25.45]Ah.
[91:26.15]Woo!
[91:27.03]That's... Yeah.
[91:29.25]Yeah.
[91:29.59]Why did it just cut out?
[91:32.73]all well that made up for my winning last round I guess because we were all like almost the same time I got boy I got beaten by zero three that's right you did well that's because you have a better connection hold on grandma's moving that was host advantage what the even is an Xbox this is an Xbox your phone is an Xbox your duck is an Xbox your toaster is an Xbox
[92:05.65]Xbox.
[92:06.83]PlayStation.
[92:10.19]Switch.
[92:10.87]Switch 2.
[92:11.47]You guys are just lucky we're not doing this shit in real life.
[92:13.58]Oh, shit.
[92:15.52]Could be.
[92:16.04]Like a real wobbler built in human person?
[92:18.80]Oh, never mind, but no, that we can't do.
[92:20.68]Oh my god!
[92:21.93]Oh, we just died.
[92:22.57]Wait, what the fuck?
[92:25.63]Oh, I think I get it.
[92:26.15]Wait, is going backwards, how are you supposed to do this?
[92:29.15]You're supposed to thrust.
[92:33.64]Okay, I get it.
[92:45.00]You gotta find balance point.
[92:47.63]Yeah, you don't want to end up going backwards either.
[92:50.47]Alright, let's do it.
[93:08.24]I'm not good at this, my weight.
[93:14.09]My controller's dead zone is so high, it's just never gonna work.
[93:19.38]I'm gone.
[93:19.94]No, Vinny!
[93:34.29]No!
[93:35.17]I clopped it.
[93:38.48]My dead zone is all fucked up.
[93:40.52]My controller's dead zone is like either zero or a thousand.
[93:46.71]Thank you, controller, for that victory.
[93:48.26]It was very helpful.
[93:49.52]I think your dead zone is in a few years, grandma.
[93:52.30]Sorry.
[93:59.83]I laugh.
[94:00.57]It's still close.
[94:01.39]It's still close.
[94:02.75]Here we go.
[94:03.21]Times two.
[94:03.75]Family feud time.
[94:04.51]We know this one.
[94:07.42]Don't like this one.
[94:15.23]Oh, I win these.
[94:17.68]I'm really good with big balls.
[94:24.25]I just thought about what you said, and I was like, oh, that's what also balls are.
[94:28.09]That's funny.
[94:28.93]Oh, my God.
[94:29.99]I'm killing you guys.
[94:32.30]Come here.
[94:37.28]It's laggy.
[94:37.80]It's going so fast.
[94:41.69]Vinny's in first place.
[94:42.49]We want to get Vinny.
[94:43.29]Get Vinny.
[94:49.67]Nah, I'm done.
[94:51.10]I ulted Fjord.
[94:53.48]I ulted Fjord too.
[94:54.90]You guys ever have a friend like that who just left really fast?
[94:57.64]Yes.
[95:00.53]I hate that.
[95:03.13]That's for baby gamers, yeah.
[95:06.80]If you play fighting games, you know that 80% of people are baby gamers because they leave before they lose.
[95:14.15]Yeah.
[95:15.03]If you play Tekken, you lose faith in society.
[95:19.68]For me, fighting games were never a huge competitive thing, but I do enjoy a good Soul Calibur match.
[95:28.03]That's the only one that really... You would win.
[95:32.07]I know.
[95:32.84]I think you would really like that Absoluium game.
[95:35.26]Absoluium?
[95:36.64]Absolum?
[95:37.76]Me and Stuart playing that.
[95:38.64]It feels like a fighting game.
[95:40.33]It's multiplayer, though?
[95:42.23]It's like two players.
[95:43.87]It's really good.
[95:44.91]Can you play it single player?
[95:46.85]Yeah, I think so.
[95:52.43]hard actually so I don't think we just understand the pairing the pairing is just hard you guys like oni musha okay because that's like a parry heavy game that's going to be coming out soon like I played the demo of it was like parry parry hell but it was really good we did better in that one come on what's going on here
[96:22.91]Onimushi?
[96:25.59]Come on.
[96:27.07]No!
[96:30.22]How did I get nothing?
[96:31.06]It's 2-36?
[96:31.66]Come on.
[96:34.10]How far am I gonna score?
[96:38.61]That was way easier on a controller.
[96:40.27]I'll tell you that.
[96:42.19]I'll tell you what.
[96:44.94]10 points between first and second.
[96:47.24]Come on, dude.
[96:48.14]I just gotta win every single one of the remaining games.
[96:57.30]Grapple, get the ship.
[97:03.19]Yeah, that kind of sums it up.
[97:06.67]Oh, we go in a row.
[97:08.65]Yeah, we get turns.
[97:12.14]Everybody gets a practice run because otherwise he has advantage.
[97:16.82]Okay, don't ready up.
[97:19.60]Dude, do I have to like die?
[97:20.51]You know what?
[97:22.31]Just do it.
[97:22.93]Just ready up so he can't get any more practice.
[97:27.27]Vinny, it's going to get in his head now because he got practice and he's going to blow it.
[97:31.36]But we all get practice now, no?
[97:33.82]OK, if you all want it, it's the same game we just played.
[97:38.61]I don't need it.
[97:40.99]OK, let's just go.
[97:41.51]Alright, good luck Ster.
[97:44.45]Don't fuck it up.
[97:45.11]It's back to go first.
[97:47.74]Stirring appears overheating.
[97:50.48]You got this buddy.
[97:51.37]Ooh, whoops.
[97:53.27]Oh, oh.
[97:55.57]Oh, screw up.
[97:56.26]Oh, man.
[97:56.98]That's a lot of misses.
[97:59.36]Oh, dude.
[98:00.76]Yikes.
[98:04.57]Got that one, though.
[98:05.47]Got that one.
[98:05.99]That's good.
[98:06.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[98:08.87]See?
[98:09.13]Now you guys get to learn the fucking rules and I lose.
[98:11.58]You have a limited amount of grapples.
[98:13.30]Wow.
[98:15.93]Well, yeah.
[98:16.63]That's why you're collecting new ones.
[98:18.70]No, it said get the furthest.
[98:21.23]Oh wow, that's not good.
[98:21.91]Oh!
[98:22.07]I thought they were points!
[98:29.62]That's...
[98:29.92]I would restart.
[98:32.55]Dude, I was laughing.
[98:35.37]Just die.
[98:36.47]I was laughing at that.
[98:37.86]This doesn't count.
[98:42.80]I thought you said we had a limited amount of grapples.
[98:44.83]I had a shitload.
[98:47.31]Yeah, at the top left, it shows how many you have.
[98:50.97]Oh.
[98:54.36]And it said, get the furthest to win.
[98:58.62]Oh shit, big play by Poke.
[98:59.89]Oh my god.
[99:00.17]Okay, so you're...
[99:02.03]I thought it was just the...
[99:04.03]Okay.
[99:04.15]Okay, so everyone laughs at me that I didn't know when I went first, but you, you're cool.
[99:08.18]You're, oh no, fuck, he doesn't know.
[99:10.24]Hey.
[99:12.59]Crazy plays by Poke.
[99:15.49]Yeah!
[99:18.14]You gotta play these once anyways to understand what the fuck's going on.
[99:26.05]Wait, I used two already?
[99:27.79]See what happens?
[99:33.15]Okay, see?
[99:34.56]Guys.
[99:35.32]Oh, talk shit, get hit.
[99:37.14]No, no, no.
[99:37.70]I used two as soon as I started.
[99:40.90]And it threw me off completely.
[99:42.65]The mind virus.
[99:46.00]That's so funny.
[99:47.62]That sucked so bad.
[99:50.78]It's because you double clicked.
[99:52.17]Controller bad.
[99:53.43]Controller bad.
[99:54.85]Hey, my dead zone is a little too high.
[99:56.61]That's all I'm saying.
[100:01.44]Where's the sound?
[100:02.38]Is the battery dead?
[100:06.62]Yeah.
[100:07.81]Yeah.
[100:09.53]Fuck.
[100:11.19]This is a good bit, I know.
[100:13.62]It actually is.
[100:15.44]I do my best.
[100:19.90]Oh, Polk, let's go.
[100:21.55]We are the team to beat.
[100:23.71]I don't want Vinny to win.
[100:29.44]So we gotta get bricks on our side.
[100:30.86]Which one's me?
[100:37.17]Oh my god, we're just, like, teleporting into each other.
[100:45.52]Pretty good physics.
[100:46.86]Good clacky sounds too.
[100:48.17]I really appreciate the clacky.
[100:49.23]They are great sound effects.
[100:51.33]And then someone comes in and like they step in here.
[100:54.70]That's the sphere of fear.
[101:18.74]Bomb.
[101:22.17]No, put the bomb... Get both bombs on their side.
[101:30.28]Good.
[101:38.08]Oh, there.
[101:38.50]Why isn't that blowing up?
[101:39.78]Yeah, what's going on with the bombs?
[101:41.72]I think it's ending.
[101:42.86]That's for the end.
[101:43.93]What?
[101:45.19]oh my god dude what the fuck oh my god oh no I was too focused on the bombs I didn't know they blew up at the very end oh fuck Ster that was pretty good we finally made a good team yippee yippee
[102:14.58]But yeah, now I'm even more difficult to defeat.
[102:20.01]Only two games.
[102:21.91]Jersey boys, I'm not from Jersey.
[102:24.05]Fuck.
[102:24.99]I win.
[102:27.58]Close enough, I guess.
[102:28.60]Okay, navigate the hidden path as fast as you can.
[102:36.10]Ready up, ready up, no practice.
[102:41.39]I'm ready.
[102:43.75]Ster.
[102:47.20]Let's go.

[103:10.25]What was the timer?
[103:11.03]Okay, it's over.
[103:13.18]Okay.
[103:15.35]Throwing a fit.
