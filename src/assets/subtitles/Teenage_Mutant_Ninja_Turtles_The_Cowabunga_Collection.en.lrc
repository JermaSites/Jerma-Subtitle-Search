[00:20.08]hey what's up within five seconds of the stream starting I'm here I'm right here look boom flick flick flicker here we are what's up we got some stuff going on today first of all welcome back
[00:48.72]I did get to watch my own personal streams of Ster play Demon's Souls.
[00:57.25]They were just for me.
[00:58.89]Sorry if you're part of Ster's community.
[01:00.19]Those streams were not for you.
[01:01.74]They were for me only.
[01:05.40]It was great.
[01:05.80]He loved it.
[01:07.68]I think at the end he said that he was putting it on his tier list.
[01:11.59]It was up at least in the top three, top four.
[01:17.50]He said it was not his least favorite Souls game.
[01:22.41]It's and he said he put it in the top six of his favorite Souls games.
[01:26.53]That's pretty good.
[01:27.15]That's it like almost top five.
[01:33.22]There's only like six games.
[01:40.45]There's only 2000 people here.
[01:41.65]Two minutes you fell off good.
[01:49.85]Are we going to play Shredder's Revenge?
[01:51.34]No.
[01:54.82]We got some stuff to do.
[01:58.13]First of all, we're going to play the original Ninja Turtles for the NES.
[02:05.82]This is Turtle Week, by the way.
[02:09.19]For one day and for like one hour.
[02:13.41]But I do, I got the Cowabunga collection, which it has all the, pretty much every single Ninja Turtles game that came out before 2005.
[02:25.57]It's all here.
[02:28.51]And you can play a bunch of them online.
[02:31.84]So that's kind of fun.
[02:33.90]I want to do a... I think me and Squeaks talked about playing Turtles in Time together.
[02:39.13]But I think a four-player Ninja Turtles arcade game would be pretty fun.
[02:48.98]But there's like ones for the Game Boy.
[02:50.73]There's ones for, there's a couple for the Game Boy.
[02:52.83]I might play those for a little bit too.
[02:54.69]I don't know when we're doing horseman stuff.
[02:57.30]I think we're doing Castle Crashers.
[03:01.38]So that's possible later.
[03:04.81]All four of us have kind of said to each other, hey, like, when are we doing this?
[03:09.22]I don't know, maybe at some point tonight.
[03:11.36]So it's like maybe in like an hour or two, we'll play Castle Crashers.
[03:16.73]And Castle Crashers just got a cool update where you can add a bunch of crazy shit to the game now.
[03:24.12]So I have gone through and I have downloaded a bunch of random avatars.
[03:29.93]Where's the little boo-boo?
[03:31.07]I would love to not see that word in chat ever again.
[03:35.74]I don't have it, okay?
[03:43.88]You said you would show us.
[03:45.52]That's true.
[03:46.12]I did.
[03:46.62]I fucked up big time.
[03:48.36]My cam's not on today.
[03:49.58]It's not even plugged in.
[03:50.55]It's buried under a bunch of trash.
[03:55.29]I've been cleaning, guys.
[03:56.23]I'm cleaning up.
[04:00.36]But we're going to start with the... This thing's kind of cool.
[04:03.60]I want to go through this a little bit before we do anything.
[04:08.70]Turn this back on so you can hear it.
[04:17.14]But yeah, so see?
[04:19.38]You can go to the turtle's lair.
[04:23.31]And it has all the game boxes and stuff too, which is kind of cool.
[04:31.16]Oh shit.
[04:32.62]Why is it bouncing around?
[04:35.91]What am I doing?
[04:36.51]What's happening?
[04:38.13]What is going on?
[04:39.41]What's happening?
[04:41.89]Hello?
[04:44.96]What was that?
[04:47.68]What is going on with this controller, dude?
[04:49.46]What's happening?
[04:53.33]Should I... I think I need to... I think I have to use the Xbox controller.
[04:59.55]Because the PlayStation 5 controller, I don't know if it's translating very well here.
[05:04.58]Let's try this again.
[05:07.30]Okay.
[05:08.56]So, if you're going to use a PlayStation 5 controller with the Cowabunga Collection, just be aware it's kind of fucked up.
[05:17.65]This is cool, though.
[05:20.74]So this is for the... Is this for the virginal one?
[05:25.25]Yeah.
[05:27.41]Okay, this one we're going to be playing.
[05:30.14]I'm going to be playing this one.
[05:31.02]By the way, I only know...
[05:34.38]uh, the first level of this game, because like every kid back in the... I'm gonna swallow my spit here.
[05:40.26]Uh, like every kid back in the early 90s, late 80s, I got to maybe the first sewer part of this level, died 10 times, and never played it ever again.
[05:52.72]So, we're gonna see if I can get past Childhood Me and Childhood Every Me.
[05:56.59]Everyone.
[06:01.09]That's cool, though.
[06:03.21]It has all the manuals, too, which I think is fun.
[06:05.68]It has them in Japanese.
[06:10.08]That's cool.
[06:14.35]Let's go to the best box art ever.
[06:15.75]It's Turtles in Time for the Super Nintendo.
[06:23.26]And, okay, the Ninja Turtle games are weird.
[06:25.55]They made the same game, like, nine times.
[06:29.96]There was a Turtles in Time version that was in the arcade.
[06:32.81]There was one on the Super Nintendo.
[06:34.59]They made this other heist version for the SEGA Genesis, which was effectively the exact same game.
[06:41.26]There's like three Ninja Turtles games across 10 different platforms.
[06:49.55]For instance, here, look, ready?
[06:51.43]I don't even know why they did it either.
[06:53.89]Because Ninja Turtles 2 is the Ninja Turtles arcade game.
[07:00.54]Let's get out of here.
[07:01.40]I've never heard of... Okay, so here's Turtles in Time.
[07:07.17]What a great game.
[07:08.01]I can't wait to play this with Squeaks.
[07:12.54]This one is only two-player.
[07:16.64]I want to play the SNES one.
[07:18.38]I know the arcade one is four players, but I want to play the SNES one.
[07:22.87]Because I think that is the best version of the game.
[07:25.45]The arcade one's cool, but this one's got... The music's better.
[07:28.84]And I like the fighting better.
[07:31.86]I did play the latest game.
[07:33.64]I played... It was kind of a weird Hades-like.
[07:37.51]It was kind of fun.
[07:38.61]I actually didn't hate it.
[07:39.45]I liked it.
[07:44.25]Can you play the music?
[07:45.22]Oh, you bet your ass I'll play the music.
[07:47.10]I remember this game, too.
[07:47.94]I remember this game.
[07:48.62]I was terrible at this, but it's in the game.
[07:50.06]It's in the collection.
[07:52.77]Alright, where is it?
[07:54.17]Yeah, okay, the Hyperstone Heist.
[07:57.21]This is not Turtles in Time.
[07:59.79]But it is.
[08:01.35]It just is the same game.
[08:04.46]It's odd.
[08:06.14]They kind of, I don't know, they released the game like five times.
[08:09.36]Why did they do this?
[08:10.08]Anybody know?
[08:11.87]Hey dude, Ronald McDonald is back.
[08:14.79]I heard about this very last second.
[08:18.18]And I am freaking out about it, yeah.
[08:20.46]Ronald McDonald is back.
[08:24.39]You can see all their ad campaigns.
[08:27.82]All their magazine ads for every game.
[08:29.74]Okay, so this is... Okay, I like this.
[08:33.92]I think this is how you make a collection like this cool.
[08:37.09]Oh, let's go to... Go to music.
[08:40.25]Let's put something else on.
[08:45.49]So, if you're going to make a kind of retro, hey, look, it's all the games again...
[08:52.71]I feel like this is the way you actually should do it.
[08:55.97]Where is it?
[08:56.29]There it is.
[09:00.32]Alright, we got to play the first one, right?
[09:02.44]This one.
[09:04.25]I love this song.
[09:04.91]This is like my favorite.
[09:05.63]This is like top 10 OST songs ever.
[09:09.30]I love this song.
[09:21.55]No, I wanted to play it the whole time!
[09:32.92]Did I not have to play the whole time?
[09:37.85]I did play Shredders of Renge.
[09:38.83]It was great.
[09:42.24]Hey, well, we'll do it again.
[09:46.90]I can't wait to play this game this week.
[09:53.32]a turtle head back when I was a kid this is like I lived and breathed the turtles man it was I loved it
[10:10.50]Alright, how about I just play the first level?
[10:13.17]Okay.
[10:13.53]Okay, I'm going to play the first level of Turtles in Time.
[10:16.35]Just because it's my favorite game ever.
[10:18.71]Okay, we'll play... Ster's going to be pissed.
[10:20.96]Ster is... I know he's in the chat right now.
[10:23.20]He's here to watch the NES one.
[10:26.83]But I just want to play the first level.
[10:29.23]Just the first level.
[10:30.21]And I will... For one second.
[10:36.70]But what I'm saying is...
[10:39.02]When a game company actually adds, like, even the advertisements, commercials, and take me back to the time.
[10:45.81]Don't just, like, put this stuff, which is very obviously emulated, right?
[10:49.40]Don't just, like, give me the, here it is.
[10:50.68]There's, like, six games.
[10:51.56]Alright, see you later.
[10:52.20]Go fuck yourself.
[10:53.74]I actually do like that they added a lot of stuff.
[10:55.44]There's a lot of fun little things to look at.
[10:59.71]Alright, so this one was a banger.
[11:01.01]I remember losing, like, five dollars in this machine.
[11:06.28]I remember it broke my heart every time.
[11:09.48]Uh, if I- if we play this with the horsemen, we need to do a thing where you're only allowed to bring- we can only bring a certain amount of money to the arcade.
[11:17.77]You think that's a fun idea?
[11:20.12]Where it's like, okay, everybody gets three dollars.
[11:23.04]And it's- it's 25 cents per life.
[11:25.87]And we gotta beat it.
[11:27.51]That's boring.
[11:29.27]What do you know what's boring and not boring?
[11:35.68]That's fun!
[11:40.38]Ban that guy.
[11:41.42]Yeah, ban that guy for life.
[11:49.79]Alright, so this is the arcade version.
[11:51.79]This is not the version.
[11:52.59]Okay, let's go.
[11:53.17]I'm going to do this.
[11:55.28]Yeah.
[11:55.68]Okay, how should I do it?
[11:59.02]Let's go full.
[11:59.82]Let's turn the CRT filter on.
[12:02.89]And we'll keep it like this.
[12:03.55]I don't want to do widescreen.
[12:07.27]I'm just playing this for one level.
[12:11.73]Yeah.
[12:18.36]That was so fucking loud.
[12:20.40]Why is that so loud?
[12:23.51]Oh my God.
[12:24.17]I didn't know it was going to be like this.
[12:25.87]I don't remember this bit.
[12:26.83]Maybe this is why my eyes hurt when I was a kid.
[12:32.86]Alright.
[12:33.08]So here we go.
[12:33.70]This is the best.
[12:34.58]This is, I'm not kidding around.
[12:36.85]This is one of the top 10 best video games of all time.
[12:42.29]just is and you'll see why in about 10 seconds let's go that's not me playing don't get excited yet alright I I had this debate in Ster's chat and I want to ask you guys what turtle am I because we were talking about the four horsemen being different turtles and I don't know I don't know if I fit a category
[13:12.13]Donatello.
[13:13.25]That's what people were saying.
[13:14.27]I don't agree.
[13:15.13]I'm not... I'm not the smart one.
[13:18.05]I'm the one that can create, make engineering and make robots and stuff.
[13:22.56]I can't do that.
[13:26.86]People were saying that Poke was Michelangelo.
[13:28.70]So we can't be both.
[13:29.93]We both can't be Michelangelo.
[13:38.45]We were saying that Esther was Raphael.
[13:42.49]So who would Vinny be?
[13:45.49]I feel like it's between me and Vinny between Leo and Donatello at that point.
[13:57.90]Alright, we gotta do a poll in chat here.
[14:01.02]Am I Leonardo or Donatello?
[14:03.87]This is very important.
[14:04.63]You have to give your actual real opinion.
[14:08.69]This means a lot to me.
[14:15.14]Because I will force them to be these characters if we play this.
[14:18.04]So, this is important to me.
[14:25.31]That's a lot of Leonardo!
[14:26.89]Leonardo?
[14:28.08]I mean, maybe?
[14:31.02]I don't know.
[14:32.86]I feel like I kind of vibe with him a little, but... That's surprising that that many people are saying Leonardo.
[14:47.22]Vinny is smarter than you.
[14:51.20]Vinny actually probably is smarter than me.
[14:54.73]Alright, well, we'll go with Leonardo.
[14:57.91]And we're just going to play the first level.
[15:00.26]Here we go.
[15:04.84]Dude, I skipped the cutscene accidentally, but it's alright.
[15:12.19]Oh, let's fucking go.
[15:13.33]Ninja Turtles in 2025!
[15:14.92]What?
[15:27.63]How do you run?
[15:28.21]I forget.
[15:28.71]Do you double tap?
[15:31.36]Oh, you just have to keep going.
[15:32.54]Yeah, there we go.
[15:41.73]And no dodge roll in this game.
[15:43.77]Get good, gamers.
[15:45.49]I'm sorry.
[15:46.33]I'm sorry.
[15:46.87]I'm sorry.
[15:47.61]I'm sorry.
[15:48.07]I've been watching Stirr play Demon's Souls.
[15:50.22]I've been like a chat troll for three days in his chat.
[15:52.88]I'm sorry.
[15:58.48]I fucked it up.
[16:14.40]I love how it's like, please let me play, player two.
[16:16.66]I forgot about that.
[16:17.55]And he just smiles up there.
[16:29.85]I love the boss music in this game too.
[16:38.73]Alright, don't tell Squeaks that I pre-played this game.
[16:50.16]Who is Mike?
[16:52.09]Michelangelo!
[16:59.87]But you played it in the 90s.
[17:02.50]I know, but I haven't played this game in probably at least 10 plus years.
[17:19.31]I love when they start blinking.
[17:20.92]That's how you know they're almost dead.
[17:23.14]Why don't games do... How come that's not in God of War?
[17:25.52]You know what I mean?
[17:31.92]When you're fighting, um, like, I don't want to spoil the game, but you know what I mean?
[17:36.94]Like, how come bosses don't blink anymore?
[17:50.91]Dude, I still got it.
[17:52.16]I spray him perfect.
[17:53.18]I remember I did that every time when I was a kid.
[17:55.98]Playing this in an arcade was an experience.
[17:59.34]I loved the arcade game.
[18:05.36]Alright, so this was like a different level, but it's still cool.
[18:09.85]Let's just look at it.
[18:11.07]You know, let's just look at the beginning.
[18:21.26]Alright, alright, alright.
[18:22.04]I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[18:22.86]I'm done, I'm done.
[18:24.42]I'm done.
[18:26.40]Okay.
[18:27.97]So let's do what I wanted to do, but I'll show you all of them here because this is cool.
[18:32.67]It'd be great to play tournament fighters with some people.
[18:39.30]I wanna try the ga- here we go, alright.
[18:41.12]So this is the game.
[18:42.14]This game, um, enraged so many of us when we were young kids.
[18:55.73]This is the original.
[18:58.33]Uh, I didn't have any idea where to go when I played this game.
[19:08.14]Okay, let's start.
[19:17.01]Change controls.
[19:18.25]Okay, up, down, left, right, start.
[19:20.71]Switch weapon, attack, jump.
[19:23.55]There's a rewind too, so we can cheat.
[19:24.96]That's good.
[19:26.96]Okay, there we go.
[19:27.56]Alright, I start as Leonardo.
[19:40.40]I'm going on the first sewer.
[19:41.89]This is where I always died.
[19:43.01]I lost every time here.
[19:47.49]This game sucks, by the way.
[19:49.72]I have to relive this.
[19:55.37]I hated this game as a kid.
[19:56.71]That's what I'm saying.
[19:57.49]We need to get enraged together.
[20:02.40]Is it still as hard as it was when I was younger?
[20:06.46]That's what I want to see.
[20:08.91]Because I feel like at this point, I already would have been half dead.
[20:11.71]Is it because I was just a stupid kid?
[20:22.18]Shit.
[20:22.86]Took too much damage already.
[20:29.26]I feel like this guy killed me when I was younger.
[20:30.91]No, it was Rocksteady.
[20:34.79]Rocksteady killed me every single time.
[20:36.33]Alright, I'm going to focus up.
[20:37.41]I'm going to take this dead serious.
[20:48.70]Okay, we're good.
[20:51.62]Fuck this game and Ghostbusters.
[20:54.50]Ghostbusters is awful.
[20:57.25]Okay.
[21:00.43]So where else can I go?
[21:01.19]I can go that way.
[21:01.91]This game was very confusing about what you should and shouldn't do.
[21:10.69]Okay, so I have to go this way.
[21:16.73]Yeah, I remember that.
[21:17.83]That used to make me very angry.
[21:25.30]Okay, I can throw these, but I'm going to save them.
[21:27.78]No, I'm not.
[21:30.88]How do you throw stuff?
[21:34.07]Oh, there we go.
[21:34.49]Okay.
[21:39.45]Forgot about that.
[21:45.85]Alright, this is it right here.
[21:47.17]Okay, this part right here, the amount of... And then I would lose.
[21:56.13]Let's see if it still happens.
[22:08.53]Alright, we're good.
[22:15.27]I've got 50% HP.
[22:17.47]That's the only level I've ever seen.
[22:18.87]That's not true.
[22:28.46]Uh, I'm gonna go in here.
[22:30.90]Oh shit, hold on.
[22:33.80]This did do this in the original hardware as well.
[22:37.77]For those of you that never played the regular Nintendo,
[22:40.90]Uh, the regular Nintendo had a tendency just to kind of start flickering every menu.
[22:48.15]How the fuck am I supposed to get up there?
[22:53.80]I don't remember any Ninja Turtle game or show that had a guy with a chainsaw.
[23:04.08]Oh my god.
[23:10.62]We're still fine.
[23:11.22]I got pizza.
[23:17.21]I gotta go really, really slow.
[23:26.52]All that was to get a full health.
[23:28.81]I already had half health.
[23:29.77]It wasn't that bad.
[23:32.93]Actually, this is... Oh, come on, man.
[23:37.63]I forgot.
[23:38.19]It's regular Nintendo.
[23:39.41]Everything respawns if you go off the screen.
[23:54.55]This music goes pretty hard, though.
[23:58.16]You do get... Okay, so you get four lives in this game, and it's a roguelike.
[24:02.51]You get four lives, and it's the four turtles, and then the game ends.
[24:07.75]This is a true roguelike.
[24:14.14]I do remember this, yep, there it is.
[24:18.02]Okay, I've never killed this in my whole life.
[24:26.49]What the fuck is that guy?
[24:32.36]Alright, we're just going to cheese it.
[24:38.13]Did I get anything for this?
[24:53.52]It's going to work.
[25:00.51]It's so funny how easier childhood games get once your brain develops.
[25:05.78]Oh, yeah?
[25:06.62]Look, I just spawned him again.
[25:08.12]Alright, well, whatever.
[25:09.64]I'm spawning.
[25:11.10]Can I spawn like a hundred?
[25:12.95]Wait.
[25:22.69]It fucking kills you instantly.
[25:27.29]Leonardo got caught.
[25:28.67]Who fights next?
[25:31.53]Can I rewind that?
[25:33.10]Do you guys care if I rewind that?
[25:37.74]I should be able to rewind this.
[25:39.93]Sure.
[25:40.35]Yeah.
[25:40.87]I mean, it's an NES game.
[25:47.02]I think I lost access to... Fuck!
[25:49.76]Okay.
[25:50.56]Keep in mind, there's only 10 seconds to rewind if you get hurt.
[25:56.01]Uh, we're gonna go with... I'll go with Raphael.
[26:02.88]And you have to start the whole thing over again!
[26:04.72]What the fuck?
[26:05.78]There's another one!
[26:06.57]Where did he come from?
[26:07.95]What's going on here?
[26:12.34]This is a different game!
[26:25.34]Okay, I thought everyone that was saying that when your brain develops, it gets easier.
[26:31.16]I feel like as my brain has developed, it's gotten harder.
[26:34.02]Why am I going the other way?
[26:35.17]I'm going backwards.
[26:36.75]Hold on.
[26:37.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[26:38.01]This is not right.
[26:38.69]This is not right.
[26:50.12]We had progress already.
[26:52.88]Oh, this sucks.
[27:01.77]I have to get to at least the second boss.
[27:08.68]No one in history has seen it.
[27:15.46]We would be the first people to see it.
[27:18.22]Do I have to fight Rocksteady again?
[27:20.79]Okay, at least he's dead.
[27:26.53]Okay, don't fuck around with this thing.
[27:28.41]I'm going in this one.
[27:39.59]Really?
[27:40.49]Shit.
[27:41.35]Don't die.
[27:52.00]How did I still get hit?
[27:57.97]Why are they sending the turtles out one at a time?
[28:01.80]Okay.
[28:01.92]I can't read your chat message right now.
[28:04.68]I was going to say, because it's not in the fucking... No!
[28:07.20]No!
[28:07.92]There's not enough memory in the RAM to... Okay, everyone shut up for a second.
[28:21.44]It is randomized!
[28:23.49]No!
[28:29.26]What the hell even are these things?
[28:41.13]Alright, clear it out and then let's start it.
[28:49.72]Die!
[28:52.67]Die!
[28:57.11]I can't even duck this shit!
[29:02.82]Okay, I'm gonna get an extra life here.
[29:07.10]Thank goodness.
[29:09.12]Oh.
[29:09.88]No, that's not an extra life at all.
[29:15.55]Oh my fucking god, I don't know who that guy was.
[29:17.05]That was a frog guy, and I just beat him instantly.
[29:20.36]What did that even do for me?
[29:26.08]Um, so what?
[29:31.31]What the hell did- I just spawned the whole game!
[29:35.39]It's crashing my NES!
[29:39.23]What the fuck?
[29:44.14]Why did I even come over here?
[29:45.44]Okay, so there was no reason to... Bra guy just becomes a regular enemy.
[29:57.70]It's for a high score?
[29:59.52]Oh, well I don't care about that.
[30:01.15]Okay, we might have to re... I can't rewind more than 10 seconds.
[30:13.84]Alright, thank god.
[30:22.33]Oh, fuck this guy.
[30:39.76]Don't kill me!
[30:42.19]Excuse me?
[30:43.15]He didn't even touch me.
[30:52.65]Come on!
[30:54.77]Yes!
[31:01.37]I still have a chance.
[31:02.59]I got the exact rewind.
[31:11.20]If you didn't think I was gonna abuse this, you're crazy.
[31:17.55]Alright, so what the hell's even up here?
[31:18.85]I think there's a major boss in here.
[31:27.81]Getting here as a six or seven year old was a crisp as miracle, guys.
[31:31.74]You don't understand.
[31:51.90]Give me a pizza, please!
[32:00.51]This is some Mega Man type shit.
[32:02.14]I hated this in Mega Man.
[32:09.19]Full pizza, right here.
[32:11.05]Full pizza!
[32:13.99]Oh shit, it's Bebop.
[32:16.12]No, it's not.
[32:16.50]It's Rocksteady.
[32:17.16]Which one's which?
[32:22.56]Can he come up here?
[32:42.95]No!
[32:44.32]Hey, Dramamu!
[32:48.36]Hey, Dramamu!
[32:57.24]Can I hit him from down?
[32:58.06]No.
[33:15.69]If I could just teleport six-year-old me into the room right now.
[33:22.82]And he watched what was happening on the screen.
[33:27.53]He probably would sit there and just go... How is that fun?
[33:34.72]You didn't even really do it.
[33:37.84]I'd be like, well, you understand.
[33:39.45]Listen to me, son.
[33:40.43]When you get older, you'll get it.
[33:49.72]Where am I?
[33:53.06]I don't think I've ever seen this before in my whole life.
[33:57.42]I definitely have been to that level before with Bebop and Rocksteady.
[34:01.91]But I don't... Maybe once with... Okay.
[34:05.81]Once when I was seven or eight years old, having this much health with the last turtle?
[34:11.50]Probably yes.
[34:30.86]The six-year-old me would probably be like, um, does that work in real life, too, in the future?
[34:35.93]Because I ate something off the ground, and I think Bob's going to be mad, and I'm going to get sick.
[34:41.27]Oh, no, sorry, me from the past.
[34:43.26]I hate to tell you this.
[34:44.76]It's only in video games.
[34:46.20]We've only figured that out.
[34:48.02]Oh, well, that's kind of lame.
[35:06.66]Do you gotta switch to Donatello, man?
[35:09.46]Um... Okay, fine.
[35:16.89]Donatello is the best character in this game.
[35:21.05]And you're seeing why very, very clearly.
[35:22.97]That's why I saved him for last, because he's the best turtle in the NES version.
[35:29.20]Do they even have stats?
[35:30.48]They might not even have stats.
[35:38.20]I think he's slower.
[35:39.52]I think his attack speed is slower.
[35:51.97]Wait, so you mean to tell me that the only new technology to rewind is so old people like you can pretend like you did things?
[36:05.70]This is what I turn into?
[36:10.38]And then all of a sudden, he goes back to his time.
[36:12.26]He's like, I'm gonna fix this!
[36:14.98]And then in real time, I get, like, huge.
[36:18.83]I get huge muscles, I have that ton of, like, athletic ability, I can throw a ball wicked far, and I'm like, oh, whoa, what the fuck did he do?
[36:26.34]He must have hit the gym.
[36:27.44]Hardcore.
[36:29.78]And little does he know... Get the fuck out of here, you little shit, I'm just gonna ruin it!
[36:36.25]Alright, I'm just jumping over this guy.
[36:45.90]Don't you understand?
[36:47.22]Don't you understand, son?
[36:49.36]I am you.
[36:50.46]I always end up here as you.
[36:52.69]I don't- it doesn't matter how big I am.
[36:55.21]You know what I'm gonna do today?
[36:56.31]I'm gonna sit on the couch!
[36:58.19]No, no!
[36:59.82]No!
[37:09.57]Full health.
[37:12.53]Despite everything, it's still you.
[37:20.29]What would Boston Jerma say?
[37:27.76]Boston Jerma did save states, would save multiple save states, like 10 different slots of save states, just in case the other save states didn't work or he wanted to make sure he did something differently.
[37:41.93]So... He's doing the same thing.
[37:47.46]In fact,
[37:49.50]I distinctly remember... Hey, like, seven-year-old Jerma.
[37:53.85]What's up, dude?
[37:55.43]Talking all this shit.
[37:58.09]I distinctly remember a, like, sixteen-year-old or seventeen-year-old Jerma... ...trying to figure out how to work ZSNES.
[38:10.17]What is this fucking program?
[38:18.76]I had to have been like 17 or 18.
[38:25.21]And I think I actually remember.
[38:28.11]Wait a minute.
[38:32.76]Why are they so easy?
[38:33.62]I think it's not even hard.
[38:39.86]Having beef with your past self.
[38:42.37]I know, I'm kidding.
[38:43.63]I don't think it's funny.
[38:51.60]Jump.
[38:52.84]I'm jumping.
[38:55.16]It's a hard jump.
[38:56.85]I know it's a hard jump.
[38:57.49]Watch.
[38:59.17]Oh.
[39:01.45]I can't even do that one.
[39:06.66]Do we have pizza?
[39:08.41]No.
[39:09.69]Why?
[39:09.97]Oh my god, pizza.
[39:14.35]It doesn't exist anymore, man.
[39:16.36]What?
[39:17.38]No, pizza doesn't exist.
[39:21.13]We ran out of pizza ingredients a long time ago.
[39:24.08]Wait, I remember this part.
[39:25.20]This part sucks too.
[39:31.78]Yeah, I got to this part when I was a kid.
[39:34.48]No, I got to this part yesterday.
[39:51.66]Stop!
[39:52.40]We just ended already!
[39:54.28]How long is it... Why is the swim so bad?
[39:56.78]Wait, it's not up here.
[40:08.80]Oh, you have to hit all the... That's right, I've... This part was maddening.
[40:16.51]You have to destroy all those in two minutes.
[40:18.77]That's what it is.
[40:31.63]What song is this?
[40:37.98]This is a song.
[40:45.01]Whatever.
[40:45.57]I'll just damage the root.
[40:48.04]Did I get them all?
[40:50.92]I think I got them all.
[40:56.34]Oh my goodness.
[40:59.88]This game over.
[41:01.50]I need a full pizza, and I can only play as Donatello.
[41:10.59]Ah!
[41:11.68]Oh, what the fuck is this?
[41:12.98]Did you beat this one?
[41:14.12]Hey, kid!
[41:15.82]What?
[41:16.46]Did you beat that?
[41:18.54]Um... That's what I thought.
[41:27.86]Oh my god!
[41:32.45]Stop spinning!
[41:33.49]What the fuck is going on?
[41:38.46]You can't get out of here!
[41:39.72]I have to freeze in the middle.
[41:54.70]Um... How the fuck do you get through this?
[42:04.55]Did you beat this?
[42:05.99]Did you beat it?
[42:11.10]I'm sorry.
[42:11.82]I'm sorry.
[42:12.32]I'm sorry.
[42:12.60]I'm sorry.
[42:12.84]I'm sorry.
[42:13.11]It's alright.
[42:19.02]Dude, I can't get out of here.
[42:26.13]Can I freeze in the middle?
[42:32.95]Holy shit, it is a frame perfect freeze.
[42:45.53]This is not completable.
[42:46.86]This is not possible.
[42:48.50]How would a person do this?
[43:03.04]How would you do this?
[43:07.48]I only have 21 seconds?
[43:20.18]There's no way to go in!
[43:21.82]What you are seeing right now is the Breath of the Wild Hero's Journey.
[43:33.45]Each one of these is another time that I died coming back here doing the whole game again.
[43:39.91]Let's see if he gets through it.
[44:09.88]Dude, I- This is fucking impossible.
[44:14.37]How do I swim down?
[44:15.43]I ca- Once I go up, I can't- I can't go back down!
[44:41.30]I can't, okay, I can't even stop moving.
[44:45.22]I can't break the leaves, no.
[44:48.75]Why did I, I need to, okay.
[44:51.07]Speedrun.
[44:57.94]Uh.
[45:00.02]Hey, we can continue from right here.
[45:01.56]Nice.
[45:02.08]Okay, we're fine, we're fine.
[45:04.54]I have to have enough health to just damage boost through that whole thing.
[45:15.19]Get out of the fridge.
[45:18.85]Get out of the fridge.
[45:32.83]Why don't you want me to go in the fridge?
[45:34.52]I don't know.
[45:39.80]Why would I not want you to go in there?
[45:44.82]Now, I don't want you to see that my fridge looks like it's permanently somebody on an Airbnb vacation, okay?
[45:56.95]I don't want you to see that.
[45:57.84]I don't want you to see that's what I turned into.
[46:13.42]Look at this guy, man.
[46:24.59]Come on, get up.
[46:35.56]Actually, I have to go to the grocery store.
[46:37.01]That's a good point.
[46:40.45]What should Airbnb be?
[46:45.25]Oh, an RV?
[46:47.56]I pooped my pants one time when I went there.
[46:51.26]No, no, not it.
[46:52.86]It's not the same thing.
[47:00.42]Guys, I didn't have Arby's once until I was like 27, okay?
[47:05.19]I did not eat it once until I was almost 30.
[47:09.15]Or even older.
[47:11.72]I may have been like 32 the first time I ever ate Arby's in my life.
[47:15.67]Alright, you're fucking me up.
[47:20.74]None of this happened.
[47:21.68]None of this happened.
[47:28.26]Pizza time!
[47:52.59]Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[47:56.34]You shit your pants at 32?
[47:58.54]I don't think so.
[48:08.67]This is fun though.
[48:10.73]For coming out in this era, it actually is pretty well put together.
[48:18.59]God damn it.
[48:19.23]Wait.
[48:21.37]What's the difference between Boston, Vegas, and... What's the difference between Boston... Wait, I... Hold on, I can't... Whatever, the answer is three, okay?
[48:45.39]I don't know.
[48:59.29]I gotta go fast.
[49:02.29]Alright, go up.
[49:05.37]The one to the left.
[49:15.85]Are you asking what the difference between when I lived in Boston versus living in Vegas?
[49:19.14]Actually, not a whole lot.
[49:20.46]I mean, I got older.
[49:22.60]I hit my post-30 era.
[49:28.11]While I was still in Boston.
[49:34.63]So, I mean, I don't know.
[49:35.27]I'll take that, it's fine.
[49:39.28]I gotta get this one down here.
[49:52.51]Okay.
[49:53.33]I think that's it.
[49:58.33]You lost the accent.
[50:01.56]Um... Yeah, I think I did.
[50:05.40]We are not going to the music on that one.
[50:15.72]Okay, here we go.
[50:16.40]I'm just damage boosting through this whole thing.
[50:17.84]I did this one, right?
[50:20.36]Yep.
[50:27.71]What the fuck is happening?
[50:29.05]I can't swim!
[50:29.79]Oh, just go already.
[50:44.92]Whatever.
[50:45.38]Is there one down here?
[50:49.36]I didn't miss one, did I?
[50:51.50]That would suck if I missed one.
[50:53.89]Did I miss one?
[50:58.19]How many are there?
[51:01.47]This might be a rage quit scenario if it's not all of them.
[51:09.71]What the fuck, man?
[51:11.11]Are you kidding me?
[51:12.09]How are you supposed to do this in two minutes?
[51:17.76]Dude, it pulls you and you can't even swim up.
[51:19.88]I'm mashing the button.
[51:26.81]The mechanics of this swimming makes absolutely no sense.
[51:32.54]Sometimes I will press A like 30 times and I won't go up at all.
[51:41.07]Oh, come on.
[51:42.23]Fuck off.
[51:48.66]I can't go that fast.
[51:57.00]How are you supposed to go through this?
[52:04.14]Get in there!
[52:07.49]That's not it.
[52:08.25]I didn't win.
[52:08.93]That's it.
[52:09.23]Game over.
[52:13.90]Dude, what the fuck, man?
[52:16.70]How are you supposed to do that?
[52:22.09]You have to be so framed by- No wonder everybody- Wait!
[52:26.76]I can do it with another turtle!
[52:32.78]Death is a mechanic.
[52:38.41]Alright, so the last one was probably all the way to the right.
[52:50.62]I am spamming!
[53:14.51]That is miserable.
[53:15.27]I don't know how you're supposed to do that without getting hit.
[53:17.27]At least six, seven times.
[53:33.71]Okay, I went down, so this one has to be this way.
[53:35.71]Let's go.
[53:38.43]Yeah.
[53:51.14]Alright, let me check in with the horseman.
[53:53.04]Let me make sure I'm not late.
[53:56.02]No, no, we're good.
[53:57.41]Oh, hold on.
[53:58.31]Not seen.
[54:03.24]Whose apartment is this?
[54:09.23]Oh, this is the intro.
[54:13.37]This is Shredder.
[54:14.67]Listen to me, Turtles.
[54:16.29]I hacked all of every television network to make sure I could find you watching TV.
[54:21.94]I'm sorry, I'm interrupting SpongeBob.
[54:23.99]We have taken Splinter to get him back.
[54:26.83]You must defeat the Foot Clan.
[54:31.52]I hope this actually reached you when you weren't in the bathroom.
[54:34.38]It was expensive to go on every television.
[54:41.25]Alright, let's go.
[54:45.97]What would a 30 second spot on every television on Earth at the same time, how much would it be?
[54:53.14]Ooh.
[54:56.68]I have like a turtle mobile.
[55:06.40]Where'd he go?
[55:06.90]What?
[55:09.60]Alright, I'll get up here.
[55:14.11]Whoa!
[55:14.79]Weird enemies.
[55:15.33]I gotta pee.
[55:26.69]I'm gonna get a pizza, hopefully, at the end of this.
[55:28.81]And then I gotta go pee.
[55:30.91]Dude, what on Earth are you supposed to do about that guy?
[55:38.87]There we go.
[55:44.82]Can I... Can I go up there?
[55:51.37]Pizza sounds great.
[55:53.21]Pizza does sound kind of great.
[56:01.13]Oh, fuck you.
[56:02.95]Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit.
[56:15.27]Yeah, I'll definitely use a boomerang.
[56:20.73]Just pre-fire everything.
[56:22.49]Oh, come on, dude.
[56:23.62]My whole... There's an earthquake in my NES right now.
[56:27.06]How am I supposed to play during that?
[56:40.93]Oh, what a fucking pizza.
[56:47.48]As long as I catch him, it's fine.
[56:50.17]Yeah.
[56:58.06]How many can I have out at once?
[57:01.52]Three.
[57:08.71]Okay.
[57:08.83]You can just walk over it.
[57:11.10]Alright, I just got missiles, I think, for the car.
[57:20.64]I'm just going to wait until he goes.
[57:40.96]Okay, we're good.
[57:42.63]Slow motion.
[57:47.32]Thankfully there's still two turtles left.
[57:50.13]So I can... I can sacrifice one of them if I have to.
[58:05.20]Okay, cool.
[58:07.35]So I have 10 missiles.
[58:08.69]What do they do?
[58:10.84]Okay, well, we're not using one.
[58:13.16]Just wanted to see.
[58:13.96]Alright, I get a P. I'll be right back.
[58:17.20]You'll notice we're not doing ads.
[58:20.45]That's because we're going to play co-op later, and I don't know when, and I don't want to have an ad break happen when I'm about to switch over, so no ads.
[58:31.46]I'll be right back.
[58:36.06]That is not accurate, so let's take that off.
[58:41.79]I'll leave you with the music though, because it's a good track.
[62:00.36]What's up?
[62:03.26]That's funny.
[62:05.17]I'm having a piece of chocolate right now.
[62:06.43]And all I can think about is every chocolate commercial has that guy with the chef hat on.
[62:11.83]With the whisk.
[62:13.50]And he's got a whole chef outfit.
[62:16.00]And he's leaning down.
[62:17.06]And just chocolate is dripping off.
[62:19.82]And he's a master at his craft.
[62:21.53]And he's in a full bleached teeth white chef hat and chef apron.
[62:30.50]And he leans down close to the bowl and it drips off of the whisk.
[62:33.93]Do people do that?
[62:43.26]Is that a thing?
[62:44.94]That seems like such a fun job.
[62:50.33]If that guy exists from the commercial, that sounds like a really cool job.
[63:02.63]Can we gamble on a coin flip?
[63:05.53]No.
[63:06.59]You didn't behave.
[63:17.72]You didn't behave!
[63:20.77]Oh, I can turn it up.
[63:27.85]That's a good audio level, I think.
[63:31.70]Alright.
[63:33.80]I don't want to use the missile.
[63:34.74]What if it's good?
[63:43.69]Should I use it?
[63:47.94]Dude, it kills in one hit.
[63:52.05]Can I blow that up?
[63:54.17]Wow.
[63:57.76]Wait.
[64:03.77]Damn it!
[64:09.72]I could have saved it.
[64:14.35]No, you can just run those guys over.
[64:31.98]Oh, whatever.
[64:33.07]Why even kill them?
[64:37.11]They're just in the way.
[64:42.99]He's gonna be right here.
[64:45.07]Yep.
[64:47.40]Oh, god damn it.
[64:48.46]He's gonna spawn indefinitely now.
[64:57.18]Son of a bitch.
[65:01.93]No, I'm just driving.
[65:02.91]Let's go.
[65:10.02]Alright, which door?
[65:15.91]I got multiple options.
[65:17.25]I got a lot of options, actually.
[65:18.63]Holy shit.
[65:26.88]I'm going on this one.
[65:38.05]Okay, what was Ster talking about?
[65:39.21]Ster said that Battlefield 6, you have to change something in your BIOS.
[65:44.07]What was he talking about?
[65:54.79]You have to do secure boot.
[65:57.17]You need secure boot enabled.
[66:05.72]All I wanted was for Diablo 3 to just be Diablo II with a little bit better textures and like 300 more uniques.
[66:13.93]That's all I wanted.
[66:15.51]That's all I wanted.
[66:21.74]That's all I wanted.
[66:29.40]You wanted Remastered Diablo II.
[66:31.74]And that was a great game.
[66:33.05]That was really well made.
[66:35.77]But I just wanted it again, but with more.
[66:39.04]Ah!
[66:47.39]Oh boy, this is kind of a... This is kind of a jump, isn't it?
[66:52.54]Now, how am I going to get out of here?
[67:00.65]Dude, Mario is fucking rolling over in his grave right now.
[67:09.97]That's right, he's dead!
[67:17.68]Why am I getting a cr- Oh, that was from Jump King.
[67:20.16]I remember pla- okay.
[67:26.55]Recycled the bit?
[67:27.45]No, I just remembered it and said it again.
[67:34.62]Hey, we're effectively on the reunion episodes right now, okay guys?
[67:38.41]Do you understand?
[67:41.49]The show's been on the air for 15 years.
[67:43.24]We have been doing reunion episodes for the last two.
[67:45.76]At least two seasons.
[67:50.01]Whoa!
[67:53.30]Yeah, they all sucked.
[67:54.26]No, they didn't.
[67:54.64]Are you kidding me?
[67:56.07]I'm sorry, Season 4 through Season 12 was some of my favorite time here.
[68:06.41]I'm just telling you the way it is.
[68:18.59]Got it.
[68:26.07]What a great move that is.
[68:30.34]You don't enjoy now?
[68:31.52]Of course I do.
[68:33.49]I'm just saying that I think season 3 to season... 12.
[68:39.79]Or 11.
[68:40.92]No, definitely 12.
[68:43.50]Is this guy just gonna hurt me now?
[68:44.96]Can't...
[68:56.55]Yeah, you guys don't remember when I, yeah, the, when I jumped over all the, um, motorcycles, whatever it was?
[69:01.58]Alright, hold on.
[69:13.82]There was no point in doing that!
[69:18.66]Ugh!
[69:30.15]Yeah, season one, they were just trying to find their audience.
[69:34.89]Season two and three really started to kind of find the rhythm of what the producers and directors were trying to do with it.
[69:53.77]What show?
[69:54.89]Me!
[70:10.26]Ego.
[70:12.30]This needs two rockets?
[70:14.02]Gotta be something crazy back here.
[70:19.19]What do you garden with three steamrollers?
[70:24.34]Dude, what the hell is all this?
[70:27.94]I hope this wasn't a waste of shit.
[70:30.44]Was it a waste?
[70:32.97]Do I have time to rewind?
[70:35.37]It was a waste.
[70:36.05]Go.
[70:40.52]Oh, thank God!
[70:41.94]Nice!
[70:42.46]Okay.
[70:47.25]So where do I have to go?
[70:48.03]Up to the right?
[70:59.33]Oh, whatever.
[71:00.11]Just go.
[71:09.31]I only have two rockets left.
[71:17.19]Dude, where is this taking me?
[71:18.76]I feel like I'm playing on a perpetually generating map.
[71:26.05]What the fuck is going on?
[71:27.65]Where even am I now?
[71:38.25]Is this it?
[71:39.31]This is the only... Okay, I'm going here.
[71:41.19]I... Nope, we're not doing it like that.
[72:05.31]I'm not being troll, I promise.
[72:14.58]You dick.
[72:22.19]Rewinding is crazy.
[72:24.43]I am solely convinced now that six-year-old me did not beat this.
[72:32.18]And did not even attempt to beat it.
[72:33.52]Wouldn't even think to beat it.
[72:36.92]Use Donatello.
[72:42.61]We saved Donatello, but we need Donatello.
[72:44.91]And that is not right at this moment.
[72:50.90]Oh, come on, dude.
[72:52.61]Fuck off.
[72:54.49]I'm about to... I need this extra hit, though.
[72:57.60]Okay.
[73:08.56]You know what's crazy?
[73:19.08]Like, five years ago, I would have let you guys bully me to not rewind.
[73:24.45]Because I would have been like, the chat said it was bad, and the chat said I was a bad gamer and stuff, so I can't.
[73:34.14]I absolutely would have been like, I guess I can't rewind.
[73:38.05]People might think I'm bad and stuff.
[73:39.83]I don't care.
[73:41.23]I want to see the fucking final boss.
[73:46.27]Can I pick that up, please?
[73:54.14]Oh, look.
[73:55.94]Oh.
[74:00.67]You used to be a good person.
[74:09.58]Still doing alright.
[74:12.83]Oh my god.
[74:13.39]I have to show you guys something.
[74:16.25]When we're done with this.
[74:21.06]There's something that you need to see.
[74:27.39]No, I didn't replace the spread thing.
[74:30.52]I guess I didn't have very many shots left in it.
[74:33.16]Whatever.
[74:39.10]Alright, we gotta be getting to another boss soon.
[74:45.14]We haven't seen anything in a long time.
[74:49.27]Okay, well that's death.
[74:56.05]Oh, here it is!
[74:57.95]Who is it?
[74:59.84]Who the fuck is this?
[75:00.46]An evil turtle?
[75:04.28]Is it Metal Head?
[75:09.44]Oh shit, there's another one!
[75:24.67]Uh... I saved Splinter.
[75:27.82]I did have to rewind.
[75:30.90]Oh!
[75:34.87]Get the blimp to chase the helicopter.
[75:39.66]You can do it!
[75:47.19]Alright, let's get the blimp.
[75:53.94]Who ever painted these road signs is a fucking idiot.
[75:57.92]Oh.
[76:07.67]I'm gonna get the pizza and I'm gonna switch turtles.
[76:13.26]Yeah.
[76:14.96]Alright, we're gonna bring out Mike.
[76:17.88]Not Donatello.
[76:19.96]You gotta look like Splinter.
[76:38.24]Whatever.
[76:40.71]No!
[76:41.10]He just one full square.
[76:43.44]Go back.
[76:46.93]What a dog shit room this is.
[76:48.87]Go all the way back.
[76:54.06]Can't swing that far.
[76:56.18]Okay, you know what?
[76:57.21]We're gonna have to bring out the big guns here.
[77:21.21]Monotelo is so good in this game.
[77:23.24]Crazy.
[77:29.81]Nope.
[77:33.94]Nope.
[77:35.88]Let's, let's, okay, that could be Michelangelo that gets hit by that.
[77:53.36]We'd still be in the shitty water segment if you didn't save states.
[77:58.05]Dude, that section is miserable.
[78:05.78]That's so bad.
[78:06.58]I forgot how truly awful that place was.
[78:08.40]I took so much damage right there for no reason.
[78:16.99]Why?
[78:22.69]Is that the boss?
[78:28.86]Uh, that was a pretty sick cutscene.
[78:34.35]Nice.
[78:37.05]Do it again.
[78:45.71]Sick.
[78:46.47]Again.
[78:52.24]Sick.
[78:54.96]Again.
[79:01.15]Alright, well, whatever.
[79:06.98]I need that pizza.
[79:17.31]What's my favorite old cartoon?
[79:18.49]There's way too many to choose from.
[79:28.37]Even his projectiles slowed down.
[79:31.39]Made it harder to dodge that.
[79:49.35]I can't imagine a speedrun of this game like a no-hit run.
[79:53.20]How would you even do that?
[79:56.11]I don't even know how it's possible to do a no-hit run on this game.
[80:06.56]I'd be tool assisted.
[80:07.54]I could see somebody doing it.
[80:16.14]Uh, let's switch to Raphael.
[80:22.02]What does that mean?
[80:23.81]Okay, they just fire at each other?
[80:27.61]Give me that shit.
[80:29.44]Yep.
[80:37.99]I love pre-firing these.
[80:38.89]It's the best weapon.
[80:45.55]So-so-so-so-so-so.
[80:54.52]So-so-so-so-so-so.
[81:01.57]I'm telling you that's not from Augie and the Cockroaches.
[81:05.17]It's not from that.
[81:06.00]I am telling you.
[81:15.47]I watched it.
[81:16.59]It's not that.
[81:17.46]It's something else.
[81:23.27]It probably isn't even from anything at all.
[81:29.11]Oh, come on, dude.
[81:35.36]There it is.
[81:35.78]This one.
[81:47.53]Are you serious?
[81:49.67]No way.
[82:02.10]Okay, that was quick at least.
[82:10.59]Just one.
[82:16.02]I love the lowercase stream.
[82:18.49]Is that my title lowercase?
[82:27.26]I tried to duck.
[82:28.72]Input lag.
[82:29.76]Huge input lag.
[82:33.39]It's at least 70, uh, 700 milliseconds.
[82:44.64]Ah!
[82:47.65]Ah!
[82:52.95]Nooooooo!
[82:56.82]Nooooooo!
[83:05.53]hey that's not fun yet it's everything is lagging like crazy did six-year-old me just not even think that was happening
[83:36.87]Oh, fuck off.
[83:41.47]I'm just getting out of here.
[83:42.89]I sacrificed Raphael, whatever.
[84:02.21]I need a pizza.
[84:04.36]Let's go with Mike.
[84:06.48]Leonardo's just been dead the whole time.
[84:09.62]He's actually pretty good.
[84:23.58]Didn't rewind once.
[84:24.24]It definitely wants me to go on this one, but I'm going to go on this one.
[84:45.04]You ever played Chrono Cross?
[84:45.98]Oh, I've talked a lot about Chrono Cross.
[84:51.05]I've played through it multiple times.
[84:55.04]Alright, where's this helicopter?
[85:05.35]I don't hear a dick.
[85:12.74]Ummm...
[85:15.64]I'll go in this one.
[85:20.00]It's Leonardo!
[85:24.89]Oh, nice!
[85:25.89]That's me!
[85:32.26]Alright, hey, that's gonna get really awkward.
[85:34.50]If we get in the horseman call and somebody else wants to be Leonardo, what do we do?
[85:39.77]That's really awkward.
[85:40.71]When one of your friends says that they're the character that you want to be, that you think that you identify with, that's where it gets messy.
[85:58.93]I feel like this level is going to be one and a half frames a second.
[86:08.66]Oh my god, what a terrible- this is a fucking Mario Maker level.
[86:25.96]Dude, what the fuck?
[86:29.54]I don't want that.
[86:30.24]I don't- I don't want that.
[86:32.51]I have to go the long way.
[86:34.11]I don't want this.
[86:47.61]No!
[86:49.03]No!
[86:56.46]Oh my god.
[86:57.84]Get me out of this fucking level.
[87:00.04]This place sucks.
[87:06.13]2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3.
[87:16.23]Okay, well... What the fuck is the point of this?
[87:24.20]This is wrong.
[87:32.03]Where do I want to go?
[87:33.03]This one?
[87:35.97]Wasn't I just at 16?
[87:40.04]Maybe this is right.
[87:50.99]Oh, please.
[87:51.65]I didn't even see you.
[87:52.29]Um... Huh?
[88:01.71]Do you have to damage boost this?
[88:08.72]Say goodbye to the hitless runs.
[88:11.50]Oh.
[88:12.50]I just go... Shit.
[88:24.70]Wow.
[88:36.13]Hey, no.
[88:42.54]I was just waiting.
[89:07.04]Is this the helipad?
[89:11.59]I feel like I'm making progress, but kind of.
[89:14.30]Okay, yeah, this is 17.
[89:15.36]Alright, do you think I kill Shredder first try?
[89:26.80]Because he's definitely coming soon.
[89:38.03]No, don't jump.
[89:43.88]Oh my god, dude.
[89:47.04]Oh my god, it's just all troll levels.
[89:58.46]I have all the turtles, though.
[90:02.68]Oh my god.
[90:03.50]Oh!
[90:16.15]Holy shit, I have to go all the way to the beginning.
[90:24.08]What the fuck?
[90:30.23]Oh, there's a full pizza.
[90:32.77]And how are you supposed to get that?
[90:36.24]I think it's actually just bait.
[90:45.31]What weapon is this?
[90:47.91]Ooh.
[90:49.48]That seems kinda good.
[90:54.21]Holy shit, I've never seen this before in my whole life!
[90:56.91]This thing's crazy!
[91:15.77]Ooh... No!
[91:24.24]I refuse to accept it.
[91:45.42]They have to be aiming at you and then you have to... I don't know.
[92:02.82]I would be crying if I was 10.
[92:11.99]What the fuck?
[92:14.18]Die!
[92:25.31]Ew.
[92:30.31]Go to the enemy base by blimp.
[92:32.52]You have my support.
[92:41.77]This is the base.
[92:47.36]This is gonna be a GG.
[92:49.22]There's only like another- I think this is the last level.
[92:52.02]Whoa.
[92:59.67]I need to save this because I think we're ready to play Castle Crashers.
[93:06.90]Can I save?
[93:07.32]How do I save this?
[93:07.96]Alright, save game.
[93:15.57]You will see the end of this because remember it is turtle week for one day.
[93:25.97]I want to play more of these, though.
[93:27.82]Did I even say that I wasn't going to be live for the next week after this?
[93:33.12]I didn't even say that.
[93:34.63]Alright, so here's what's going to happen.
[93:36.47]We're going to finish this tonight.
[93:41.92]We'll do a little bit of a longer stream today.
[93:44.74]Because I'm going to be gone for like a week or two.
[93:47.70]I thought I already announced it already.
[93:51.17]Oops, well, I got some stuff I'm doing.
[93:54.77]I won't be around for like a week or so, maybe a little bit more.
[93:59.28]So I'll be leaving you for a little bit.
[94:07.87]But we will finish this tonight.
[94:10.07]I'm going to move over to here and see if they are ready.
[94:13.38]Let's give them a call.
[94:15.64]It looks like Vinny just went live.
[94:22.17]Hulk, I think, is making a... Here's the thing about the Castle Crashers update.
[94:27.71]You can make a character.
[94:29.60]You open up Photoshop with the file inside of the directory, and you can just edit a fake... Not a fake, a real character.
[94:38.01]I opened it, realized it was kind of a commitment, and I was like, okay, it's going to take a while to make stuff.
[94:47.04]So I just downloaded five to 10 weird ones and we'll see how they are.
[94:58.40]I'm going to call them.
[95:10.11]Hey.
[95:10.70]Hey.
[95:13.98]What's happening, man?
[95:16.93]I'm glad to see that that game even as a child like as a child I felt like a failure but as an adult I know that the odds were stacked against me and I was destined to die it looks like I'm at the end of the game but I'll finish it later
[95:34.17]It's still fun, though, for an NES game.
[95:36.82]I think it holds up pretty well.
[95:39.42]I mean, it's fun when you can rewind time in the underwater death maze.
[95:44.41]The timed underwater hitbox registration, like, wall death... No.
[95:51.99]I don't know how... I feel like I remember when I was younger...
[95:56.97]I wasn't even getting mad at the game.
[95:58.89]I was just, I must be doing something wrong.
[96:01.24]I need to play it a little bit better.
[96:02.92]You know, like as an adult, I feel like vindicated.
[96:05.68]Yeah.
[96:06.50]Oh, you weren't dumb.
[96:08.06]You are now, but.
[96:10.91]That's fine.
[96:11.69]So Castle Crashers.
[96:14.37]I, let me just open it.
[96:17.59]Dude, this is, I actually really like this thing here.
[96:20.62]It's kind of cool because I want to go look at this a little bit more while we have time.
[96:29.44]What other music do they have?
[96:30.62]I never played Castle Crashers.
[96:34.77]Are you serious?
[96:36.93]No, I'm lying to you.
[96:38.83]That's kind of crazy.
[96:39.75]It was the beat-em-up of the 2010s.
[96:43.14]I have some playtime in it, but I feel like I did the first level and I was like, nah, and I closed it.
[96:49.31]I want to see the ads.
[96:56.76]Comic books.
[96:58.87]Can you read them?
[97:00.85]No way.
[97:01.79]What?
[97:03.17]Can you read the comics?
[97:04.46]How would they do this?
[97:06.50]I think just covers.
[97:11.62]That's still cool though.
[97:19.57]Show controls.
[97:26.18]I think it's just the covers.
[97:34.54]That's still cool though.
[97:42.97]All of them?
[97:43.57]What is this one?
[97:45.17]Were you like a Ninja Turtles comic book fan or were you just the shows or the games?
[97:55.01]I was not a very big Ninja Turtles fan.
[97:57.25]At all?
[97:57.85]Damn.
[98:00.70]Didn't play... Didn't care about Ninja Turtles.
[98:02.64]Didn't play Castle Crashers.
[98:04.40]I know.
[98:04.68]Like, you're setting me up to just be that guy right now.
[98:07.73]The hell did you do?
[98:08.73]Oh, I see.
[98:12.23]Animated shows.
[98:12.99]I think that childhood Ninja Turtle energy was taken up by Power Rangers for me.
[98:20.34]Power Rangers was a good one, too, though.
[98:22.42]For a second, I thought you could watch whole seasons of these shows.
[98:31.75]That's cool.
[98:41.65]Dude that lower right is iconic.
[98:53.48]So, am I understanding that we're all going to not know what anyone is talking about when they say, like, fight George Bush, and we're all going to have different characters?
[99:03.68]I think it's just our avatars.
[99:08.04]Unless somebody's doing something wacky in the background.
[99:09.81]No, I think as you scroll down on the... It has a base character type, and there's, like, models for every character that you can get, like, one for all the monsters.
[99:21.06]Okay.
[99:22.95]I mean, I only got the ones for my character, I think.
[99:29.14]Oh, wait, you guys were still talking.
[99:32.08]Google up Ragnarok battle off.
[99:35.00]You guys having a battle off?
[99:40.79]I have a meeting in 20 minutes.
[99:44.32]Oh, I have the same meeting.
[99:47.38]Wait, really?
[99:47.78]Are we in a call together?
[99:51.29]Right now.
[99:54.08]Wait, are we really getting a group meeting after?
[99:55.90]No, I don't have a meeting.
[99:58.41]Oh, okay.
[99:59.13]That's crazy.
[100:02.45]It's too literal, man.
[100:03.71]It is a sponsor, so.
[100:05.51]Yeah, no, I'm going to bed.
[100:07.42]You guys got a sponsor coming up?
[100:08.60]What is it?
[100:10.18]I don't know.
[100:11.88]I can't even talk about it.
[100:13.54]Alright, I feel you.
[100:15.69]Alright.
[100:16.65]Good playing with you.
[100:17.53]We'll see you guys in like a week or two.
[100:19.57]Yeah, I love you.
[100:20.11]Much love.
[100:20.59]Have a great, great time.
[100:22.65]Take care.
[100:26.94]Alright.
[100:28.96]Let's finish Ninja Turtles.
[100:34.83]I think I'm pretty much at the end of the game.
[100:43.64]Why didn't you say it back?
[100:44.46]I did!
[100:44.94]My mic just didn't pick it up.
[100:46.21]It must have gotten cut off.
[100:49.15]I have absolutely never seen this before.
[100:50.85]This is a different video game.
[100:53.56]This is a different game.
[101:01.16]Oh my god.
[101:01.94]They do more than... They do two squares?
[101:05.13]This is fucked.
[101:07.83]Let's start over.
[101:14.16]Oh my god.
[101:14.82]Alright, we gotta get a new turtle in here.
[101:16.91]We gotta bring out Donatello now.
[101:35.62]This is the hardest thing ever.
[101:41.09]He's gone.
[101:41.57]He's just dead.
[101:42.47]Whatever.
[101:42.91]I win.
[101:48.46]I feel like I'm in a Metroid level.
[101:52.92]Oh my god.
[101:53.98]That's fucking awful.
[102:02.78]I don't care.
[102:07.50]We're cheating our way through this.
[102:08.46]I don't care.
[102:12.71]Why even fight them?
[102:13.39]Just stay on the top.
[102:20.30]I'm taking too much damage.
[102:21.04]Especially on Donatella.
[102:21.84]That's bad.
[102:26.03]Why are there two?
[102:35.44]Oh my god, this is miserable.
[102:37.08]Um, hold on.
[102:39.19]Your game audio is at like 5%.
[102:40.59]Oh shit, hold on.
[102:43.21]I think Castle Crashers was loud.
[102:50.12]How's that?
[102:50.42]Better?
[102:53.23]That's good, right?
[102:54.11]Right here?
[103:00.10]Oh my god.
[103:01.18]How are you supposed to even get through this?
[103:15.55]Dude!
[103:17.60]Ugh!
[103:21.92]Like that, apparently.
[103:23.32]What are these enemies?
[103:28.05]It's fine.
[103:35.48]You need a torque emote?
[103:38.82]There's an option to turn the flickering off.
[103:42.59]Huh?
[103:48.53]I think that's like baked into the game, man.
[103:52.35]It's at the game select?
[103:56.84]Isn't that just how the game was?
[103:58.08]That's just like reading it right from the ROM, I think.
[104:06.01]I don't think you can turn that off.
[104:15.53]Can I?
[104:16.53]No, don't quit the game.
[104:22.56]Oh, it's... Right, okay.
[104:24.45]The buttons are weird.
[104:26.41]Can I go down?
[104:30.19]I want to go down.
[104:30.65]Do I need a bomb?
[104:45.21]Just get me out.
[104:51.74]Okay, this looks like correct.
[105:01.03]What?
[105:07.46]What is this for?
[105:10.27]What's your go-to slice?
[105:12.05]Uh, pepperoni.
[105:13.11]100%.
[105:13.35]Hey, look, there should be a boss here.
[105:21.49]Secret to the right?
[105:28.03]How do I get over there?
[105:35.78]Keep going right?
[105:38.91]I can't.
[105:51.22]I can't go that way.
[105:53.83]What about onion?
[105:54.37]Onion's good on pizza.
[105:55.21]I like, garlic and onion pizza's good.
[106:00.24]Are you, I'm not, I don't think I'm soft locked.
[106:05.05]Do I have to do something else maybe?
[106:07.51]There was another way to go.
[106:13.84]Banana peppers, that sounds good too.
[106:21.23]Wait.
[106:22.79]Where did I come from?
[106:27.43]I can't go this way either.
[106:34.40]I don't know where to go.
[106:35.46]I think it's up.
[106:45.33]Can I not climb this?
[106:48.19]This last level is freaking me out.
[106:53.29]Can't climb it.
[107:03.08]Where am I supposed to go?
[107:05.67]I'm going all the way back.
[107:12.88]Any Game Genie friends here?
[107:15.58]What am I supposed to do?
[107:28.88]Because I go this way.
[107:31.46]And then I can go in here, but I can't go anywhere else from here.
[107:34.65]Maybe I went in the wrong sewer.
[107:35.59]I actually might have to go all the way back.
[107:47.99]Can you go left from here?
[107:51.55]I don't think so.
[107:58.87]I don't think so.
[108:03.15]I might have to continue.
[108:04.11]I gotta go all the way back.
[108:06.33]Okay, well, I'm not going in that one.
[108:19.27]Was that one just a fake one?
[108:22.95]It was, wasn't it?
[108:26.43]I feel like something was supposed to be down there.
[108:33.98]Oh my god, I'm taking so much damage.
[108:37.79]Oh my goodness.
[108:40.47]I'm so screwed.
[108:49.57]You lost two characters at that level?
[108:50.83]Just restart.
[108:51.35]I could continue if I need to.
[108:53.42]We're not going to do it.
[108:54.56]I got Donatello and Michelangelo.
[108:56.88]We're good.
[109:03.62]Now where?
[109:07.32]Oh, shit.
[109:07.76]It's one of these.
[109:08.28]I knew it.
[109:17.42]I knew they were going to spawn an enemy right there.
[109:19.84]Oh, that's miserable.
[109:25.33]What are you supposed to do?
[109:28.79]Don't move?
[109:30.88]Excuse me.
[109:33.30]I don't th- it's- this is not completable.
[109:52.96]How are you supposed to- I can't bypass this.
[109:55.36]He's gonna knock me down every time.
[109:57.57]Okay, well I know what to do.
[110:00.73]I love- oh fuck, the rewind.
[110:04.05]Oh shit, wait a minute!
[110:07.19]Yes!
[110:15.60]I wanna bait.
[110:16.40]Let's see what it is.
[110:25.11]Get outta here.
[110:29.83]It's just a full pizza?
[110:36.77]What the hell?
[110:42.25]Wrong button.
[110:42.90]No, no, no.
[110:44.22]Congress needs to make every fucking button the same.
[110:49.60]I will die on that hill.
[110:54.15]The video game Congress.
[110:56.53]Oh my fucking god.
[110:59.78]I don't want to go up, I want to swing up.
[111:19.63]So do I have to, what do I do?
[111:21.21]I guess I could go down.
[111:22.01]Okay.
[111:28.71]Ooh, good thing.
[111:40.25]Uh, nope.
[111:44.87]They're getting real fucky with these levels at the end here.
[111:47.74]I'm sorry.
[111:49.52]What even was... What's the point of this?
[111:54.85]They're kind of just throwing a bunch of random shit into these levels.
[112:07.69]That's what I want.
[112:08.49]Give me that.
[112:12.77]You gotta be shitting me.
[112:16.68]I can't climb that from here?
[112:24.11]Oh, fuck off!
[112:36.99]Everything respawned!
[112:47.68]This is so stupid.
[112:53.73]Okay.
[112:55.10]No, but I... I... Okay.
[112:57.98]So now what?
[113:00.11]I guess I just leave.
[113:15.88]I'm not going to fucking freak out, man.
[113:17.38]I want to jump off of this.
[113:18.62]I'm about to have a freak out moment.
[113:22.45]Why can I not jump anymore?
[113:33.75]This is not the right place to go.
[113:38.85]Okay.
[113:39.05]Okay.
[113:55.62]Yeah, that's two fake-out levels in a row.
[113:59.23]Alright, well, it's probably that one.
[114:01.99]Wait, can I go this way?
[114:04.66]Nope.
[114:11.61]I probably don't... Wait.
[114:15.02]It actually might be this.
[114:33.20]No horsemen tonight?
[114:35.61]Nobody tell him.
[114:47.27]I decided just to play this for the next six hours or whatever it's been.
[114:54.62]Okay, well, we have to go all the way to the right.
[114:56.07]Oh my...
[114:57.30]Dude, I'm about to rip the cartridge out of the NES and just throw it away.
[115:08.42]I want to go back.
[115:10.28]I want Dawn to eat that.
[115:14.55]Yeah, I know.
[115:15.13]I'm calling him by a nickname.
[115:16.71]I know the guy.
[115:18.98]It's fine.
[115:33.95]I think this also is a bait level.
[115:35.99]Yeah, there's nothing here.
[115:38.04]Unless I can go down.
[115:39.22]Oh my god, the damage is outrageous.
[115:58.96]This has got to be it, right?
[116:00.94]It's got to be.
[116:11.58]I got Leonardo.
[116:12.36]Alright, I'm switching to Leo.
[116:16.95]Why am I sitting like such a weirdo?
[116:18.21]Sit up.
[116:27.21]Oh shit, I did it right.
[116:37.08]I ain't getting hit by that.
[116:44.03]Norton Lion said he would play in the next Monster Ranch tournament.
[116:48.26]Got to figure out how we're going to do the next bracket, but that's cool.
[116:51.76]Also, something interesting.
[116:55.17]The Fenric was telling me apparently he's got an opportunity to go talk to at the Tokyo Game Show, I think.
[117:03.70]I think he's going to be
[117:05.72]having some type of a liaison with the Koei Tecmo US, and then that is going to liaison to Koei Tecmo Japan.
[117:16.64]And he asked if I wanted to put a survey if people want another Monster Rancher game.
[117:21.87]He wants to see if he can get something in front of the Japanese devs.
[117:26.80]To say, hey, people want another one of these.
[117:30.10]Like a cool one.
[117:33.20]So, I think he's going to be bringing... He has a... He wanted me to link the survey.
[117:36.41]You want me to... Yeah.
[117:37.59]Mods, you want to link the survey?
[117:40.17]If you care about Monster Rancher, if you think it's a cool franchise, he will be taking this to Koei Tecmo.
[117:47.50]So... I wanted to give it a little shout because it's cool.
[117:53.64]So if you want another Monster Rancher game, this is an opportunity for you to be heard, potentially, by... the game studio itself.
[118:05.42]Uh... Where did I go?
[118:08.51]I went- This is the bad one, right?
[118:10.63]Did I do this one yet?
[118:11.35]I don't remember this guy.
[118:14.00]Did I do this one?
[118:15.72]I thought you said all the new ones sucked.
[118:21.37]I would like a new Monster Rancher that's like an updated version of the first two.
[118:28.48]We have to go down to the left corner.
[118:42.21]This seems right.
[118:45.20]Unless you're talking about that one, aren't you?
[119:02.09]Yeah, it's definitely that one.
[119:08.30]Hey, this game has been on the bucket list for a long time.
[119:11.40]Even before the Cowabunga Collection.
[119:15.88]Alright, here we go.
[119:17.93]I'm glad I'm doing it.
[119:25.53]Let's take care of this real quick.
[119:29.04]I had the wrong thing equipped.
[119:39.97]It killed me!
[119:41.88]I can't live with that, right?
[119:43.72]That's so bad.
[119:44.84]I have to live with it.
[120:03.51]I hope there's a pizza down here.
[120:11.44]So I can't see anything.
[120:19.06]Alright, this is definitely new.
[120:30.42]Okay, well, I actually don't, that's bad because how far back can I go?
[120:37.62]No, why would I sit there and test it?
[120:39.30]I know what it looks like.
[120:40.42]I wanted to give it to somebody else.
[120:44.13]If I just didn't press the button two times to test it out, I could have given it to Donatello.
[120:51.48]Oh, whatever.
[120:52.97]He's dead.
[120:57.92]That sucks.
[120:58.44]Okay.
[120:59.20]I can't die here.
[121:04.57]How's it more than two hits to kill these guys?
[121:14.32]He's already dead.
[121:15.98]He's dead already.
[121:29.95]I'll eat my ass.
[121:30.91]How is he still alive?
[121:34.74]This is fucked up.
[121:39.61]There's no... You can't go anywhere.
[121:41.14]You just have to die.
[121:44.93]Donatello's gonna have to actually pull this out of his ass.
[122:14.94]Okay, I was already down here, wasn't I?
[122:17.02]Did somebody bait me to do the same thing I did already?
[122:20.82]Oh my god.
[122:24.05]What is it?
[122:27.25]What the hell is that thing?
[122:30.96]What do I do?
[122:35.10]Wait, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[122:37.85]Go back.
[122:38.79]What is going on here?
[122:39.59]Do I have to duck?
[122:50.93]What do I have to hit?
[122:55.10]I think I have to... Okay, I gotta hit the eye?
[122:56.58]Uh... Oh, can I jump it?
[123:06.22]What the fuck is going on?
[123:07.64]No!
[123:12.11]Wrong button!
[123:21.63]Even with rewinds, this is fucking insane.
[123:26.59]I have to go back.
[123:36.09]The game's running at one and a half frames a second.
[123:39.63]Everything does damage.
[123:41.11]Everything hurts you.
[123:42.86]This is impossible.
[123:50.43]This is legit fucked that they expected somebody to play this game and actually win.
[124:05.17]I'm holding left and I moved a quarter of an inch on the screen in five full seconds.
[124:17.71]You have to have all the turtles alive here.
[124:30.19]Just kill me.
[124:38.80]That is so ass.
[124:39.84]That is ass.
[124:42.03]We have to bring all four turtles there with full health.
[124:45.13]And all of them are gonna die.
[124:51.82]I'm going to be the scummiest of save scum.
[124:55.85]And I'm just gonna get down there with full health.
[125:07.01]Hahahaha!
[125:36.20]How many times have I hit this fucking guy?
[125:45.64]I've hit him five times.
[125:47.66]What is happening?
[125:50.97]Am I rewinding the damage?
[125:52.39]No, I'm not.
[125:53.09]I've hit him like five times.
[126:09.31]I don't understand, I've hit him like nine times.
[126:11.56]That was fucking insane.
[126:13.04]That was genuinely infuriating.
[126:24.48]Whatever, I need three turtles alive.
[126:40.46]I would love a weapon, but I'm not going to get it.
[127:05.22]Just one turtle to get there.
[127:08.02]One turtle to fucking win.
[127:11.30]And one turtle for the... Ow!
[127:18.61]I just gotta get up to the head and just start swinging.
[127:21.86]Realistically.
[127:34.41]Are you gonna stop firing, please?
[127:38.43]Finally.
[127:45.24]Oh.
[127:45.76]My.
[127:46.38]God.
[127:46.72]This is the worst game ever made.
[127:48.32]This is the worst game ever made.
[127:49.46]The entire Technodrome.
[128:00.26]Every inch of it hurts you.
[128:02.62]Every single inch of this hurts you somehow.
[128:05.47]What the fuck is hitting me?
[128:09.16]What the fuck, dude?
[128:10.48]How are you supposed to fight this?
[128:13.78]Why is it not hurting me over here?
[128:24.10]Oh, fucking eat my ass.
[128:31.29]My boy Donnie right there.
[129:05.37]Yeah!
[129:07.33]This game sucks.
[129:08.79]Alright.
[129:21.81]This is it.
[129:23.34]This is the final battle.
[129:25.72]You have my support.
[129:29.17]What is rolling in with Dawn?
[129:30.49]Immediately.
[129:32.81]I'm not fucking around on this one.
[129:47.41]We're just damage boosting with Raph and getting the fuck out of this.
[130:04.13]Can I get something in there?
[130:12.73]No?
[130:23.92]Give me that full pizza.
[130:25.26]I want to give that to a different turtle.
[130:41.07]Technodrome!
[130:42.57]Let's kick shell!
[130:45.80]Hup, hup, hup.
[130:49.06]Hup, hup, hup, hup.
[130:54.53]I'm gonna regret not just dying and coming here with all full turtles.
[131:08.11]Uh, who do I actually want?
[131:09.27]Probably Leonardo.
[131:15.34]Do I think I'm better at this game now than... Hold on.
[131:22.04]uh no I don't think I'm better at this game now than at 40. and like a 10. no I don't think so I don't think it matters how good you are at the game you got this they have to I'm fine whatever how are you supposed to get that jump on his head
[131:50.15]What the fuck is going on?
[131:53.92]What is going on?
[132:01.99]Somebody explain this to me, please.
[132:05.17]What am I supposed to do about this?
[132:14.98]I can't jump on his head.
[132:22.66]I can't just walk off and jumping you're at the ceiling immediately.
[132:29.05]Can I pogo?
[132:30.79]I don't think so.
[132:40.51]I just didn't finish this part of the game.
[132:50.60]Go up a screen, left ladder?
[132:53.22]You went for the pizza instead.
[133:01.79]This is so annoying.
[133:03.63]This is fucking annoying.
[133:09.00]What do you mean go up?
[133:09.72]I have to go all the way up and then left?
[133:16.08]Dude, if I could put god mode on, I would just put it on walk to shredder right now.
[133:25.09]Look at this.
[133:26.15]Look at this.
[133:27.46]You gotta be kidding me.
[133:28.78]How are you supposed to- Yeah, go ahead.
[134:02.47]That guy just fell off and died.
[134:06.92]The tracking on this guy is wild.
[134:27.16]Can I go down?
[134:35.63]I'm just gonna keep going down and see what happens, whatever.
[135:02.90]Oh, it's a full pizza over there.
[135:11.25]It's worth the damage boost.
[135:13.97]No.
[135:24.38]Stop flickering my screen.
[135:28.75]I want, uh, I'll give it a wrap.
[135:38.37]I love that sound.
[135:47.83]That's a great sound.
[135:52.04]It's annoying that he came from the other side of the screen.
[135:54.07]Why did I even spawn him?
[135:56.81]Oh, fucking whatever.
[136:07.14]I'm just running.
[136:08.93]I'm just running.
[136:20.00]Wait.
[136:20.90]Oh, that was a super mode.
[136:27.54]I gotta make sure I use it well.
[136:28.92]Come on.
[136:35.09]That's it?
[136:36.01]Why is it not going?
[136:37.99]Wait, I know what we gotta do.
[136:42.10]He kills these in one hit.
[136:48.45]He can't take damage, though.
[136:53.38]Whatever.
[137:01.55]I wish there was a block.
[137:09.34]This is awful.
[137:10.59]Holy shit, dude.
[137:12.01]How would you... How?
[137:14.59]How would you handle this?
[137:15.69]I'm going to lose turtle.
[137:26.01]It's fine.
[137:28.17]I'm pulling out Donatello for this.
[137:31.25]This should be one hit kill.
[137:33.60]It's not.
[137:35.20]Oh my god.
[137:46.94]They're gonna be spawned again.
[137:49.14]Welcome to the Nintendo 64.
[137:51.77]Whatever the fucking console is!
[137:53.79]I don't- I'm running.
[138:22.26]No, he spawned!
[138:23.64]Oh my god.
[138:26.93]I have to damage boost with Dawn.
[138:29.63]This is fucking miserable.
[138:31.78]What is this game?
[138:33.02]This is un-fucking-believable.
[138:36.90]This is genuinely fucking crazy.
[138:40.01]That is like this.
[138:41.15]It's fucked up.
[138:45.20]Because if I try to fight him, I will respawn him.
[138:51.81]Oh.
[138:52.65]My.
[138:53.35]God.
[138:53.93]It's not... You need Game Genie to even get through the... fucking walk through the hallway!
[139:02.40]What am I supposed to do about this?
[139:07.55]Because if I fight him the way I'm supposed to fight him... Okay, here he is again.
[139:11.51]And these guys are here!
[139:15.58]What a piece of fucking dog shit.
[139:25.24]Is this better than Dracula 3?
[139:26.46]Yes.
[139:35.45]Don't go back?
[139:37.29]I- okay, if I don't go back, I die.
[139:40.52]Because if I ha- look, he only goes forward till here, and I can kill him here, and then this fucking asshole respawns in the same spot!
[140:00.39]No!
[140:01.67]No!
[140:01.93]Hold on.
[140:06.62]These stupid little scorpions.
[140:08.30]Oh my god, this game is fucking crap.
[140:19.36]I'm taking those rose-colored glasses and I'm smashing them on the ground.
[140:25.53]I hated this game when I was seven, too.
[140:27.17]What am I talking about?
[140:38.98]Oh my god, did I do it?
[140:50.94]Yeah, I've played this game and every year of my life I've played it.
[140:53.78]It doesn't matter what... When I was in high school.
[140:56.77]When I was in middle school.
[140:59.35]Oh no.
[141:00.57]Oh, actually, oh no.
[141:01.39]Oh no.
[141:35.01]I hate this.
[141:36.53]I'm going to hit Shredder once and then uninstall again.
[141:50.92]Shredder?
[141:55.08]Shredder!
[142:01.77]Oh, he kills you in two hits.
[142:04.24]Okay, I'm gonna cheese the fuck out of this.
[142:05.69]Don't worry.
[142:06.92]I got Dawn.
[142:08.33]I can take two hits.
[142:33.02]That's when you go super, Shredder.
[142:42.62]He was easier than the regular enemies.
[142:46.70]Dude, I'm sorry, Shredder.
[142:48.82]Shredder, you were harder, you were easier than the guy with the jetpack four levels ago.
[142:55.59]Wait, he's gonna be a human.
[143:11.20]I, uh, Shredder doesn't, oh wait, oh Splinter is back to his real form.
[143:14.42]You guys are, wait, what did it say?
[143:15.56]Go back.
[143:18.87]Who was the guy, the actor from Dennis and the Menace?
[143:23.35]The movie.
[143:26.25]Oh, Splinter's back to his real form.
[143:27.28]You guys are great.
[143:27.86]Thanks for your help.
[143:29.20]Uh, Walter Matthau.
[143:31.18]Let's celebrate with a pizza.
[143:34.47]The adventure of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is concluded.
[143:41.27]Wait, Splinter got turned into a rat?
[143:42.99]You don't know that?
[143:44.01]That's like the episode one, season one, minute one, intro one.
[143:49.61]Okay, that was terrible, but it was fun.
[143:56.48]I enjoyed it.
[144:01.15]I've never done that before.
[144:02.29]I just beat it for the first time ever.
[144:03.73]So now let's do real quick.
[144:08.81]There's so many here.
[144:10.05]How about this one?
[144:11.27]This one's for the Game Boy.
[144:12.41]I want to play this one.
[144:24.21]Turtles, follow the Foot Clan.
[144:25.37]1990 Konami.
[144:28.94]Oh, I have to set the controls.
[144:40.30]Okay, how's this one?
[144:45.24]In a lot of M&T stories, Splinter was never human, just a rat that got hit by the ooze and mutated.
[144:55.56]That is true.
[144:56.48]What is the actual original canon?
[144:57.82]He was like a master, right?
[144:59.84]And what's like the first one?
[145:03.31]Alright, I'm gonna be my favorite guy.
[145:11.78]I love this already.
[145:12.65]I thought it was a rat that lived under the martial arts dojo.
[145:25.59]I remember this game.
[145:28.78]Somehow less fondly than the one we just played.
[145:37.16]Not taking damage on that.
[145:49.08]This one's so cute.
[145:50.06]I love it.
[145:51.16]I love the other one too.
[145:52.13]Would I say it was the worst game ever made?
[145:53.47]That was just rage.
[145:55.03]That didn't mean it.
[146:02.68]Look at how happy he is.
[146:03.76]I love his smile.
[146:05.14]He's just like, yeah, I'm getting these bad guys.
[146:16.88]What is the actual worst game I've ever played?
[146:18.58]I don't know, man, honestly.
[146:21.32]I really don't hate that many games.
[146:25.27]I really don't.
[146:33.51]You don't die in the water.
[146:42.36]Night rain solo.
[146:43.30]I did give night rain solo a 0.0 before the patch.
[146:46.91]That is true.
[146:48.25]That was a leaked Discord message to Ster.
[146:51.36]And then I had to kind of just own it because Ster like told everybody that I said that.
[146:56.92]So I kind of had to own that.
[147:02.65]Ow.
[147:09.08]Solo Night Rain before the patch.
[147:11.81]Not right now.
[147:14.33]And when I say solo Night Rain, I know a lot of people go, what are you talking about?
[147:16.85]I'm talking about no other players, just you, just one player in the game.
[147:22.54]Before the patch, before you could resurrect, and before they made it a little, uh, the ruins easier, I was like, this is a zero.
[147:31.92]This game's a zero.
[147:42.22]Uh, I thought the actual... Whoa.
[147:45.41]The three-person part was... I thought it was great.
[147:48.15]I love it.
[147:50.43]But pre-patch, one-player single mode?
[147:55.76]I gave it a 0.0.
[147:59.89]Solo's fun now?
[148:00.67]I actually... I'm afraid to try it, because I'm afraid that I'll be like, fuck, this game sucks.
[148:06.43]It's a... No, I was right.
[148:07.74]It's a 0.0.
[148:09.21]I like the game.
[148:10.35]I really enjoy Night Rain.
[148:12.61]I don't want to give it a zero again.
[148:14.75]So even if they did fix everything and the solo's fun, I feel like I would play it and still get mad at it somehow.
[148:22.84]Solo is now considered easier than co-op.
[148:24.79]Really?
[148:25.09]Interesting.
[148:29.37]Because it definitely wasn't before the patch.
[148:31.07]I remember just dying and being like, well...
[148:34.98]what do I do I just can't you can't lose at all but I can lose with friends I want to get to the boss did they patch it again since that first time they did it because all they did I remember is they made it so you could resurrect once per night
[149:00.05]And then they made single get more runes than it did before.
[149:04.14]Did they do something else?
[149:06.46]Because I didn't really play it that much solo since that.
[149:12.19]I did a lot of threes since then.
[149:20.90]I did say they added duos.
[149:21.96]That might be fun.
[149:33.18]This game's fun.
[149:33.94]I like this one.
[149:34.54]I gotta get to a boss.
[149:44.10]I would love to one day just pull out some SEGA Master System games.
[149:49.00]Do some like Mega Drive stuff.
[149:51.75]I feel like it'd be fun.
[150:06.94]I still can't get over the water level.
[150:08.87]That water level?
[150:10.91]No way does anybody do that.
[150:12.60]That's a human.
[150:13.82]I still can't believe it.
[150:20.37]The studio that did this collection is doing a big Mortal Kombat one.
[150:23.94]Ooh, that's cool.
[150:25.62]Oh, here we go.
[150:38.96]Got him.
[150:46.93]That was my favorite part of the whole game so far.
[150:49.67]That's not even the character I was playing!
[150:59.49]What did you say?
[151:00.35]The enemy must be near.
[151:03.25]April is screaming.
[151:06.22]Jesus.
[151:07.14]Okay, well...
[151:13.03]Alright, let me just see if they do anything.
[151:14.29]Does anybody do anything different?
[151:19.38]Cool.
[151:21.00]Okay, that was fun.
[151:23.10]Let me see if there's any outlets I want to check out before I go.
[151:27.00]So that was one for the Game Boy.
[151:28.05]Also from the Game Boy, this is... Oh, this is 2.
[151:33.27]Let's check it out.
[151:39.22]Alright, do we want Game Boy Pocket?
[151:41.02]Game Boy Regular?
[151:43.84]I was a Game Boy Pocket kind of guy.
[151:46.82]I still have it.
[151:48.21]I'll show it on stream one day.
[151:49.31]I still have a Game Boy with a bunch of games.
[151:53.51]I have a nice black Game Boy Pocket.
[151:59.16]I have a Game Boy Color too.
[152:03.16]I did have the Game Boy Camera.
[152:23.72]That was a great intro.
[152:38.67]1990, so this is one year later.
[152:40.94]An options menu.
[152:49.47]Um, alright.
[152:57.91]They just did the same songs.
[153:00.57]That's so cool.
[153:03.01]Why are all the Turtles games like the Dark Souls games?
[153:06.00]They just made the same game seven times and made them increasingly better each time.
[153:28.96]I can't wait to hear all the tracks in Turtles in Time.
[153:34.74]Dark Souls copied the Turtles.
[153:39.21]I'm not gonna lie, I was getting the itch to play, um... Demon's Souls, watch and start play it.
[153:46.12]But I just watched him play the whole thing.
[153:47.68]I can't play it now.
[153:48.54]I just saw him do the whole thing.
[153:54.61]They are weirdly...
[153:56.75]buff.
[153:57.21]They're weirdly normal guy buff.
[154:02.34]I feel like this is the kind of shit that somebody would take a picture... This is like somebody is hiding their face.
[154:09.21]This is... I took a selfie in the bathroom, but put Donatello where the face is, but I'm a guy.
[154:13.93]I'm a jacked guy.
[154:14.93]Because I don't want you to know who I am.
[154:21.30]They are... This is wild.
[154:23.06]Alright, let's go Donatello.
[154:30.50]Jesus okay similar gameplay to the last one although this one's got a lot more going on before that one was just kind of smiley it was just smiley and I guess the smiley in this one too
[155:01.19]Can I go up this?
[155:15.93]He was holding a pizza.
[155:25.94]Same posture as you.
[155:29.63]My posture is bad.
[155:31.41]His posture is good.
[155:41.57]Alright, is the first boss Bebop or Rocksteady?
[155:46.32]Because Turtles in Time really did change the whole game by having Baxter be the first boss.
[155:59.14]In fact, Bebop and Rocksteady don't even show up in Turtles in Time until more than halfway through the whole game.
[156:13.61]Okay, I just looked away and I saw this on the wall next to me.
[156:18.56]This burning afterimage from when I just looked over at the other screen.
[156:22.74]Over on my wall.
[156:35.68]This one's good.
[156:45.59]They do the same thing.
[156:46.77]I want to see if they do the same thing in Turtles in Time and the arcade game.
[156:53.12]I'll load up the arcade game for a second because it's so cool.
[156:56.03]It's so cool.
[156:58.17]I remember playing the cabinet.
[157:00.58]Oh man, it was so fun.
[157:02.03]Who's that guy that said what a boring stream idea to say, hey, we all have to come in here with like five bucks and we have to beat the game with five dolls each.
[157:13.13]Was that guy still here?
[157:13.87]He's still here.
[157:22.96]That was me?
[157:24.74]Time him out again.
[157:28.05]Retroactive punishment crime.
[157:30.97]Sorry.
[157:37.10]You can get the frame where you can turn fast and do one swing and get the damage on both.
[157:43.06]Oh, here we go.
[157:43.60]Bebop, Ruxetti.
[157:52.15]Bomb.
[157:56.07]okay I love the jump it's a full front flip
[158:27.46]Whoa.
[158:31.00]Really?
[158:32.08]My animation happened first.
[158:52.81]Ambush.
[158:53.61]We got it.
[159:00.60]Dude, I imagine being under the covers with a light at 9.30 p.m.
[159:05.34]staying up past your bedtime and dealing with that.
[159:11.63]No way.
[159:13.25]Oh, look, it's Bebop!
[159:14.25]And this time he has a machine gun before he had a single shot bullet.
[159:26.10]And there's people throwing water balloons at you.
[159:31.36]They heard all the complaints from the last game.
[159:33.59]It was too easy.
[159:35.27]They're like, alright, deal with this.
[159:49.33]I'm kind of just trading right now.
[159:55.53]He loves me, he loves me not.
[159:59.26]He loves me, he loves me not.
[160:05.21]He loves me, he loves me not.
[160:07.77]Uh-oh.
[160:08.97]He loves me, he loves me not!
[160:11.98]Oh, no!
[160:17.86]But I... No, I can't be!
[160:21.49]We're in the same math plant!
[160:23.69]Whoa.
[160:24.81]Give me those pizzas.
[160:26.49]Did I softlock myself?
[160:27.43]What the fuck's going on?
[160:29.46]What the fuck?
[160:47.20]Do I jump up?
[160:48.34]I feel like I get stuck up there.
[160:53.81]Who cheeses the bonus game?
[160:55.67]I do.
[160:57.61]Hey, it is cheesy.
[160:58.55]It's pizza.
[160:59.03]I just want to see Michelangelo and we can keep going.
[161:09.32]Whoa.
[161:12.15]This is cool.
[161:28.80]Wait.
[161:32.26]Cool.
[161:34.26]Alright, let's do... That was cool.
[161:37.38]Oh my god, there's another one.
[161:38.41]This one's 60 FPS.
[161:41.55]What was this for?
[161:42.13]What did this come out for?
[161:49.00]What is GPL?
[161:50.12]Game Boy... Light?
[161:53.28]Game Boy Large?
[161:54.12]What is GPL?
[161:58.55]Game Boy Light.
[162:03.75]I don't remember Game Boy Light.
[162:08.10]Whoa, is it supposed to be like that?
[162:09.62]That's bright.
[162:10.42]Was it blue?
[162:16.55]Wait.
[162:17.73]Hold on a second.
[162:22.45]Guys, this is food mode.
[162:23.95]Wait, that was weird.
[162:24.83]I could watch the gameplay.
[162:28.15]Was it actually?
[162:28.77]Hold on a minute.
[162:34.38]Go back to that?
[162:40.53]How did I just get that before?
[162:41.65]Watch is X. This is a 49 minute video.
[162:58.87]You can just watch somebody play it?
[163:01.42]A 49 minute full playthrough?
[163:05.44]I wonder who recorded this?
[163:09.17]Whose game is this?
[163:10.19]Is this like a YouTube video that they just took?
[163:12.91]And said, hey, can we have the rights to your long play?
[163:15.47]Or did somebody just play it?
[163:18.60]A dev just played through it maybe?
[163:23.56]Alright, we have to laugh at their gameplay, because if they get hit, then... Come on.
[163:28.85]If they take more than one point of damage, that's ridiculous.
[163:34.74]I'm here at the scene of an incredible prison break.
[163:42.97]It seems that the criminal responsible is... Ah, Shredder!
[163:52.86]What if they rewind?
[164:00.27]Yikes!
[164:00.81]We gotta go save April!
[164:07.52]The turtles spring into action and head for the fortress.
[164:19.12]Meanwhile, Michelangelo is returning from the pizza joint and notices the place is deserted.
[164:30.70]Is this a way to make it so, like, Mario is not in the, you know, Mario is missing?
[164:36.83]This is how you get to play as Michelangelo's not in the game?
[164:42.03]Just then, bizarre laughter crackles out of the TV.
[164:47.95]No, it's Shredder on every channel again.
[164:50.25]Your friends are mine now, little turtle.
[164:58.86]Why does he always do this?
[164:59.96]He always goes on every TV channel.
[165:02.08]If you dare to rescue them.
[165:04.86]Come to the abandoned mine at the edge of the city.
[165:10.83]No, I'm going to the TV station.
[165:12.61]I'm going to find the guy that you have on the inside that lets you do this.
[165:17.77]And we're going after that guy first.
[165:23.74]Alright, let's see.
[165:33.72]He's just skipping the whole level!
[165:36.02]He just went to the secret area immediately!
[165:40.43]This feels really... This is a speedrun.
[165:53.35]Oh no, is it somebody that knows exactly where things are?
[165:57.91]This isn't a bot, right?
[166:04.55]There's no way you don't get hit by all these.
[166:08.91]Is it TAS?
[166:12.22]No.
[166:14.40]That would be so funny if it was.
[166:15.92]There's no way they'd be going faster than this.
[166:23.73]Maybe it's a runner that... I want to look at the credits.
[166:26.93]Maybe they're in the credits.
[166:34.99]I think you're just bad, dude.
[166:36.57]Dude, you go open this game and you do this and tell me how fucking easy it is.
[166:48.91]I just did it.
[166:49.69]Okay.
[166:50.49]Good.
[166:50.94]I'm glad you did.
[166:51.98]Good for you.
[166:55.46]I'll raise my glass to you.
[166:58.73]It could be a dev.
[167:02.31]You know, I will say, yeah, you could just look up a YouTube video of somebody doing this.
[167:07.56]But the fact that it's in the game is, I would call it very cute.
[167:13.18]There's a Mega Man door in the... Wait, this is Mega Man, but Ninja Turtles?
[167:19.73]Why do you have to fight Five Nights at Freddy's?
[167:23.15]Who is this in Ninja Turtles?
[167:24.38]I've never seen this guy.
[167:28.08]I love this, though.
[167:28.78]This is so funny.
[167:32.81]The fact that you can just sit here and watch it, you don't have to have a YouTube video open on a different screen.
[167:42.54]Yeah, this person knows what's going on.
[167:48.44]I would have been hit 10 times already.
[167:53.37]I can still pretend that this is me.
[167:58.66]I mean, I'm kind of cracked, aren't I?
[168:05.75]Oh shit, he showed the video bar.
[168:09.71]Can you do that with all of them?
[168:16.08]Yeah, this fight, I distinctly remember it.
[168:25.68]The Arcade Turtles in Time looks so weird.
[168:32.61]You know, I'm curious about this.
[168:35.85]Tournament Fighters?
[168:36.53]I haven't played this in a very long time.
[168:45.56]Gotta turn the CRT filter on, right?
[168:53.86]Watch.
[168:55.24]What is watch?
[168:59.70]You can watch in here too?
[169:06.11]I need to reset.
[169:13.72]What about Story Battle?
[169:20.47]Alright.
[169:25.04]Is Shredder gonna be on the TV?
[169:31.34]Go watch the Impossible NES run?
[169:40.08]Oh, not the TV!
[169:43.30]Oh, no.
[170:06.98]I'm holding your friends if you want to see them again.
[170:09.12]You must bow before the forces of the Shredder Elite.
[170:15.43]Uh, we've all been there before when you accidentally drag the margins on word in the wrong spot and you don't know how to fucking fix it.
[170:23.93]You don't know how to get it back to normal and you just kind of give up and don't care.
[170:30.85]So, it's fine.
[170:32.70]Oh, great.
[170:33.12]Who is this?
[170:34.22]Parai?
[170:34.98]And what's with the Shredder Elite?
[170:37.68]Who cares who they are?
[170:39.98]They've got April and Splinter.
[170:43.07]We've got to find them.
[170:45.15]Let's go.
[170:47.33]Ooh, SNES graphics.
[170:48.53]Let's go.
[170:51.42]Turtles, come in.
[170:51.94]Splinter and I are okay.
[170:54.86]We're near some ancient ruins.
[170:58.46]They should...
[171:00.81]Oh no, the transmission has been cut.
[171:04.41]We gotta find the ruins as soon as possible.
[171:13.80]Hey, we found the ruins!
[171:17.57]Oh my god, he just killed himself!
[171:21.37]Why did he do that?
[171:27.08]That was a different turtle!
[171:28.00]That was Michelangelo!
[171:32.65]Uh, Michelangelo's dead.
[171:36.50]We just kept going to the ruins.
[171:44.59]Alright, so we got medium.
[171:47.89]It is Super Nintendo, so... Oh, the daisy.
[171:49.85]Wrong button.
[171:51.52]I do not want to do that.
[171:55.08]How do I just go... Okay.
[171:57.35]So is there a left trigger, right trigger?
[171:58.75]There's not.
[171:59.13]Alright, let's go.
[172:05.41]I wonder if they can do moves.
[172:08.89]That move isn't fucking annoying.
[172:19.96]Oh!
[172:24.83]I'll get him next time.
[172:38.09]You can see me at Evo.
[172:44.32]Is there a block?
[172:57.51]I don't know, you could do a grab?
[173:06.17]Fuck you, man.
[173:15.26]Oh my god, I got annihilated.
[173:18.41]How do you grab?
[173:19.39]What are the controls?
[173:26.74]Is there a move set?
[173:27.54]Move list?
[173:36.48]no matter how well fight you know beat war okay well we gotta send another turtle in um he's dead strategy guide has the move list
[174:02.25]This is still cool though.
[174:03.97]Isn't a Ninja Turtle in a fighting game right now?
[174:08.70]Oh, is that one of the Battletoads?
[174:15.37]No, they put one of the Ninja Turtles in the game, right?
[174:19.40]Wait, there's an Ehan to move.
[174:20.86]GG.
[174:42.12]later both rash is in killer instinct and there's a turtle in a nrs game round two wait I'm thinking the ninja turtles are in smite oh come on he does so much more damage than me
[175:14.37]I did a cool move with my... How did I spin that before?
[175:24.64]No!
[175:30.83]Oh my god.
[175:34.75]Alright, must win.
[175:40.00]There it is.
[175:56.41]Dude, that frame grab is awful.
[176:21.94]Michelangelo is my turtle anyways, it's fine.
[176:31.22]I was just doing that just to see how bad the other turtles were because Michelangelo looks like the turtle that everyone's good at.
[176:40.83]Watch this.
[176:41.27]He's not even getting one hit on me.
[176:54.56]Somebody said, how are you so bad?
[176:56.78]At a game from 25 years ago that I have never played in my entire life.
[177:00.87]I don't even know what moves to do.
[177:03.38]And the game... Time that person off for an hour.
[177:11.75]I have a dragon breath?
[177:22.99]Okay, I'm getting this fucking diarrhea done.
[177:48.14]How do I grab?
[177:50.24]I have to have a grab too, right?
[178:02.01]I'm telling you, this guy does like three times more damage than you do.
[178:08.78]This guy hits me and a third of my health bar goes away.
[178:12.02]I hit him, it's like 10% of his health bar.
[178:17.42]Who is this fucking guy?
[178:27.56]Raphael's the real turtle, everybody knows that.
[178:35.98]um what different bite okay round one fight
[179:07.50]Dude, I can't even fucking attack him.
[179:13.63]I literally can't even fight him.
[179:18.73]This is fucking crazy.
[179:21.49]I forget sometimes that these old games, you know if there's like a difficulty, they usually put it like all the way up.
[179:30.00]There is no difficulty.
[179:31.00]It's just the guy's like, oh, I'm going to do every move and kill you now.
[179:36.09]I remember the old Mortal Kombats were fucking unbearable like this.
[179:40.93]These were designed to eat quarters.
[179:44.04]Was this in the... I think this is a console game.
[179:47.02]Was this in the arcade?
[179:56.92]Jesus, dude.
[179:57.82]I can't even fucking do anything.
[180:04.77]This is console only, yeah.
[180:07.37]I haven't even won one match.
[180:16.32]Story is probably harder.
[180:17.43]Do tournament mode.
[180:24.30]Is it on the default difficulty?
[180:25.56]I don't know.
[180:25.90]I just feel like I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[180:31.85]I could go actually see how to do moves, but I'm too tired to do that.
[180:40.63]Look at my health.
[180:41.13]Look at my health bar.
[180:41.77]Look at my health bar.
[180:42.80]He's hit me two times.
[180:44.64]I'm at 50 fucking percent.
[180:46.18]He's hit me twice.
[180:48.44]And why did I take tick damage after he hit me?
[180:58.66]Dude, this is fucking fried, man.
[181:03.50]I can't even go near him.
[181:15.28]Why look at the damage I'm doing to him?
[181:17.42]Why is he doing 10 to 40% more damage than me?
[181:35.17]Oh my fucking God.
[181:39.92]Dude, this is fucking so hard.
[181:43.41]why is this that I do I've played Mortal Kombat recently and I got to like shao kahn in the first like 20 minutes of me playing I'm doing the other mode I'm curious that's crazy
[182:14.36]Oh, you can actually play as the cheating characters.
[182:16.34]Okay.
[182:16.46]We're not doing that, though.
[182:29.60]Okay, Chrome Dome.
[182:50.01]he's reading all of my inputs I think I'm figuring out what's happening
[183:27.58]Oh my god.
[183:28.38]I beat him by time up.
[183:44.85]This is harder than Mortal Kombat.
[184:12.48]Yeah, I don't even know how to do combos.
[184:13.80]I don't think there even are combos.
[184:20.85]What is the energy meter even for?
[184:22.36]Okay, he destroyed me.
[184:32.93]It's a super meter?
[184:35.92]Why is the NPC cursing?
[184:52.49]Wrong button.
[184:53.69]No, don't quit the game.
[185:17.22]If he runs it back, I'm gonna fucking uninstall.
[185:21.31]Oh, please don't.
[185:22.64]Please don't.
[185:23.44]Why can I chip damage him?
[185:24.54]He should die already.
[185:27.45]Okay, imagine somebody saying that at Evo.
[185:29.11]Why is he not dead already?
[185:30.01]I can do chip damage.
[185:31.03]Please.
[185:35.82]You gotta play this game versus other players because everyone doesn't read every input you do.
[185:45.61]Hey, you're bad at the game you're playing?
[185:46.90]You're like a 15-year sub.
[185:49.32]You really want to get banned permanently?
[185:51.80]Keep it up, Buster.
[186:06.50]Asuka.
[186:09.50]These are original characters for this game, I think.
[186:50.11]Come on.
[187:00.34]I'm gonna run it back right here.
[187:11.24]She's schooling you.
[187:12.10]They're so much harder than real players.
[187:24.30]This is definitely not kid-friendly.
[187:27.02]11-year-old me would have lost where I did before and then gone, I don't understand.
[187:31.53]Dad!
[187:34.41]And then my father would come and be like, let me see.
[187:35.89]Let me take that.
[187:36.45]Let me fucking handle this, son.
[187:39.06]What do you need?
[187:39.42]We want to kill this person?
[187:40.50]Okay.
[187:41.52]And then he would get flawless victory and go, ah, we have to return this one to Blockbuster.
[188:05.63]Dude, trying to do the, like, Hadouken move with the stick here makes me want to throw up in my mouth.
[188:24.99]Use the D-pad?
[188:25.63]I feel like that's not even helping.
[188:27.74]It's because it's an Xbox D-pad.
[188:29.16]And you all know how I feel about that D-pad.
[188:50.67]What the fuck was that move, dude?
[189:11.09]That move has never landed.
[189:12.26]I've done it like nine... Finally.
[189:14.42]It finally landed.
[189:26.36]I will win with the time going out!
[189:31.55]Ooh!
[189:34.75]Coward!
[189:36.40]Hey, let me hear for the cowards in the chat, please.
[189:42.25]Press 1 if you're a coward.
[189:45.40]I'm pressing 1.
[190:00.36]What does the person say?
[190:04.29]These games were literally programmed to do unlockable attacks.
[190:07.87]There's a YouTube video on it.
[190:09.53]The AI blocks or attacks on the very last frame possible, so it's impossible to react.
[190:16.11]So wait, is my crash out certified?
[190:18.83]Is it fine?
[190:19.37]Is this a certified, like, confirmed okay crash out?
[190:48.10]Thank you.
[190:48.64]Raphael's so much cooler.
[191:00.07]I'm so happy that you said that.
[191:02.29]Because the VOD watchers are going to be like, he sucks at everything.
[191:05.30]Oh my God, he's a piece of shit.
[191:06.34]He stinks.
[191:07.44]He's bad at this and he sucks at everything.
[191:09.26]And I know he sucks.
[191:11.28]I'm so glad I read your message.
[191:13.33]So now at least like two people that are watching the VOD will go, oh, okay.
[191:17.27]That makes sense.
[191:26.88]I want to see what a full meter does.
[191:28.14]I want to do the other- No!
[191:36.02]Wrong move!
[191:39.89]I'm dead!
[191:56.00]Do you imagine chat as a bunch of autos if you just like that voice?
[191:59.63]It really depends on the day.
[192:00.51]Sometimes it's a bunch of autos, but let me try one.
[192:05.89]Let me try Shredder.
[192:07.23]See if I can play the broken character.
[192:21.13]Round one.
[192:24.55]Fight!
[192:24.69]Get ready!
[192:29.64]And why is he invited to this, by the way?
[192:36.53]He's gonna block every attack.
[192:42.74]Dude, he's got aura.
[192:45.30]That's what the kids say now, right?
[192:54.77]If I loaded up Mortal Kombat 1, I'd get to Shao Kahn first, right?
[193:01.09]And you guys would be like, oh, fuck.
[193:03.71]I'd get to Shao Kahn first.
[193:04.61]You give me Kano, and I'd get to Shao Kahn.
[193:07.08]Or Johnny Cage.
[193:09.58]Johnny Cage?
[193:10.54]GG.
[193:10.98]I'd get to Shao Kahn and beat his ass.
[193:27.28]He's trying to do moves.
[193:35.08]Okay, well I'm dead.
[193:36.40]Shroud are lost again.
[193:38.20]This game's fun though.
[193:58.77]It's cool.
[193:59.03]Let me try the bat guy.
[194:04.14]Shredder is a charge character.
[194:06.24]I mean, I'm not really putting the mental effort to... I just wanted to see what the characters did.
[194:14.93]I mean, if this was Johnny Cage, Mortal Kombat 2... Oh, sorry.
[194:18.05]Let me rephrase that.
[194:19.60]Smoke.
[194:20.32]Mortal Kombat 3?
[194:23.74]That's Game Over.
[194:35.08]I really do feel like this game is like, okay, you know when you play Smash Bros.
[194:37.67]vs. the AI and you make the AI, like, 10 difficulty level?
[194:43.92]And you're just like, wait, I'm not, like, really prepared for this.
[194:45.78]I was gonna say, do I do that till he dies?
[195:04.95]Alright, can I play with this character?
[195:06.66]Because I will just get, I will beat it with this character.
[195:20.94]Oh my god, they grab on the first frame.
[195:36.63]Oh my god, I'm fucking out of here.
[195:38.29]Fucking stupid ass game.
[195:40.85]It's fun, but fuck that game.
[195:46.20]Uh, I want to show you this.
[195:55.91]Stop jumping at him, you get it?
[195:57.35]Alright, well, who cares?
[195:59.03]It's Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters.
[196:01.94]I'm not training to go play at EVO.
[196:06.28]Oh my god, that was loud.
[196:20.47]Cowabunga!
[196:37.21]Alright, if you did this... You do that at the arcade, you're... You mean business.
[196:47.42]Is it that loud?
[196:51.92]If you ever walked over to somebody playing one of these beat-em-up games at the arcade and they had 12 stock... You just go, wow, dude, you're in it to win it.
[197:00.21]You want to see the end credits.
[197:02.13]Today.
[197:03.27]Without walking away or going to the bathroom.
[197:18.92]It says audio.
[197:29.96]This is the game I want to play with four people.
[197:39.30]This game is awesome.
[197:52.03]It's funny because this game also came out for the regular Nintendo.
[197:55.16]This is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 for the regular Nintendo.
[197:58.06]And if you want to see, I will show you.
[198:02.03]Because we'll do this and then you can look at what I'm talking about.
[198:04.27]It's really cool.
[198:07.17]It's like they did a demake of the game.
[198:11.08]It really is a demake of the arcade game.
[198:27.62]How many times have you heard that song tonight?
[198:41.63]That is kind of a painful sound, but we're alright.
[199:02.28]Who is it?
[199:16.42]It's Bebop!
[199:18.26]Look!
[199:31.18]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[199:41.42]Oh, I wanted to show you something.
[199:44.28]I'll show you after this.
[199:58.31]You could have gone back through the gnomish invention tunnel.
[200:05.48]Alright, so I don't... Stop putting in money!
[200:10.41]Alright, I just put in like $15.
[200:11.79]Um, that's not what I want to do.
[200:18.75]Ready?
[200:20.52]Watch this.
[200:29.80]Does it do it in this one or the other one?
[200:34.37]Alright, listen up.
[200:39.07]Nope, it's the other one.
[200:48.09]I laughed out loud when I just tested this early the other day.
[201:17.32]It's the... There it is.
[201:31.22]But Turtles in Time was an arcade game as well, but I prefer the Super Nintendo version.
[201:38.59]I think it's actually a better version.
[201:44.25]Music is better.
[201:46.57]I think the hits are better.
[201:47.57]I think the animations are more fun.
[202:02.76]It's almost three in the Big Apple for real.
[202:04.56]That's funny.
[202:08.59]Cool.
[202:08.71]Okay.
[202:09.69]I think that's pretty much all I wanted to see here.
[202:11.31]Besides the... I want to play these and go through them with people.
[202:15.37]I want to play this thing right now.
[202:32.21]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[202:35.60]This one's different.
[202:42.51]Audio filter?
[202:46.20]Wait, what?
[202:46.70]Is this the SEGA Genesis one?
[202:50.78]Weird.
[202:55.63]What the hell?
[202:56.83]This is like a dream version of the other one.
[203:00.12]You can play as April in this one?
[203:01.52]Who is this dude?
[203:05.03]Who is Ray?
[203:08.47]Sisyphus?
[203:12.39]Casey Jones is in this one.
[203:15.09]Speed... What the fuck is this?
[203:22.88]Not other planets?
[203:24.95]We play... It's Earth.
[203:25.91]It's New York City.
[203:27.57]Not Mirage Planet.
[203:32.90]The people that made the Genghis... The people that made the Genesis version of all these games, they were on, like, crack.
[203:51.18]Look at how hard this guy is trying.
[203:53.17]You're trying so hard.
[203:54.51]I'm just trying to show people the manta ray guy.
[203:57.16]Oh no, clone Mike.
[204:13.46]oh my god man what the fuck why are these games so crazy it's that easy
[204:37.02]No, he does not.
[204:38.92]He does not do the... Oh, I hate that.
[204:44.83]He does that?
[204:56.71]I'm dead already.
[205:07.31]He does.
[205:07.81]Oh my god.
[205:14.36]You all know what I mean if you know what you know.
[205:19.25]What?
[205:22.35]Why is it... Okay.
[205:32.87]How do I get out of this?
[205:42.34]Okay, we need to see what Sisyphus is like.
[205:44.42]And we're gonna go to... He's going nuts.
[206:21.35]Why do they all do it?
[206:27.98]They all do that stupid laugh.
[206:41.56]What is the name of that sound effect?
[206:44.74]It's called something.
[206:45.43]It's like man laughing weirdly.
[206:49.60]Oh, isn't it the cowardly line?
[206:54.81]When he's like, you know what I'm talking about?
[207:23.79]I don't play fighting games.
[207:24.81]This game's too hard for me.
[207:50.02]Come on, let me do it again.
[207:51.44]Let me do it again for the win.
[208:00.09]Okay.
[208:21.93]I do remember doing that.
[208:27.96]Casey Jones!
[208:35.53]Casey was crazy in the Hades-like version of the new game that came out, whatever it was.
[208:42.40]I'm dead.
[208:48.63]Yeah, if you guys don't know, the Ninja Turtles quietly released a Hades.
[208:56.93]It is Ninja Turtles Hades.
[209:00.32]It's a weird, roguelike Hades game.
[209:03.18]And it was kind of fun.
[209:05.06]It was hard as shit, though, at the end.
[209:08.21]Yes.
[209:08.97]This game is real, and it's actually not bad.
[209:13.57]It's called Splintered Fate.
[209:14.70]That's right.
[209:21.97]If you like Hades, and you love the Ninja Turtles, oh my goodness, I have good news for you.
[209:26.59]That game is there.
[209:28.89]I like it better than Hades.
[209:32.58]I kind of played the hell out of it for a little while.
[209:36.29]Alright, we gotta see April.
[209:39.41]Okay.
[209:51.47]Holy shit!
[209:52.85]Alright, does April O... Does April O'Neil go... That's what's important to understand.
[210:04.02]If I can get a grab ever again.
[210:12.43]Oh my god, dude.
[210:13.67]These games are dialed up to times a thousand.
[210:23.94]Why is my mic so loud?
[210:27.03]Is it?
[210:27.39]I don't know.
[210:41.80]to like quadruple combo!
[210:44.87]You can't even play people online that'll do that.
[211:04.99]Oh.
[211:09.85]She doesn't do it.
[211:17.05]These games are hard.
[211:49.44]These games are fucking hard.
[211:50.58]I can't, I'm not doing it.
[211:56.96]Okay, here it is.
[211:57.38]Look at this.
[212:09.50]Cool.
[212:15.70]Okay, so you saw the, you saw what I did before, the arcade game.
[212:23.64]Here it is, the demake version.
[212:37.06]Same level.
[212:41.84]I played this more than the arcade game.
[212:44.77]For sure.
[212:46.31]And I loved them both.
[212:50.15]But if you had a friend that had this, or if you were the friend that had this, the sleepovers went crazy.
[213:18.64]I want to play through these, I really do.
[213:22.87]We did the first one.
[213:26.54]You definitely got into the most trouble at sleepovers.
[213:31.59]I've got a funny story for you.
[213:36.17]This is one of many, many stories about, you know, growing up.
[213:42.64]But... How many times did your parents have to come in and say, Alright, that's enough!
[213:50.11]Everyone has to go to bed now.
[213:52.17]And it just kind of... It felt like being at school.
[213:56.76]It felt like the teacher was coming in and was like, oh no, we're going to have detention.
[214:01.87]I remember being in a room with like four or five of my friends.
[214:06.30]And... And my father.
[214:09.96]You know, we were being loud, we were being little shits, being annoying.
[214:13.39]My dad comes in.
[214:15.25]This is probably the fourth or fifth time that it's been like, okay, settle down now.
[214:19.30]It's like 10, 15.
[214:20.90]That's it.
[214:23.15]And my father comes in.
[214:24.69]My father was one to give very long-winded explanations and little mini-speeches about everything.
[214:31.54]Like, let me tell you something.
[214:32.84]We're going to be quiet now.
[214:34.30]And the reason for that is because we've got to get up early in the morning.
[214:36.65]And getting up early in the morning is important.
[214:38.83]And we went through this whole thing.
[214:41.34]Finally gets to the end of saying, like, that's enough.
[214:43.87]No more talking, no more laughing and screaming.
[214:47.53]We all on the same page here?
[214:50.46]And one of my friends at the time says, no, I'm on page 52.
[214:56.57]And he goes, you're going home.
[214:58.31]And he kicked him out.
[214:59.09]He threw him out of the house.
[215:01.96]And he actually went home.
[215:03.24]One of my friends actually went home.
[215:09.73]He actually sent him back home.
[215:21.28]It's so funny.
[215:22.33]It's just one of those stories that I just never forget.
[215:24.61]Because I remember thinking, I was like, oh my goodness, what did you just do?
[215:32.20]What did you do?
[215:33.94]What did you do?
[215:37.05]And it wasn't even me getting in trouble.
[215:38.55]It was like one of my friends was getting in trouble from my dad.
[215:43.21]Like, whoa, dude, that's an odd feeling.
[216:10.14]It also might be an appropriate time for me to say this too.
[216:13.68]I think enough time has gone by for me to bring it up.
[216:17.71]I actually lost my father a few months ago.
[216:30.92]So, it's been something I haven't really talked about on screen.
[216:38.77]But,
[216:41.81]Yeah, he had some trouble in the end.
[216:44.64]The last few years, especially the last couple of years, it's been a little tough, but... And I remember talking to my mother about this, about like, are you going to talk about that on stream?
[216:59.10]And I'm like, uh, I don't know, maybe, maybe eventually.
[217:06.20]Because I don't really share a whole lot with the stream that's not like, Oh!
[217:10.99]I puked in my mother's bed one time!
[217:13.97]But... I figured maybe eventually I could at least speak on it a little.
[217:28.09]But look, look, look, look!
[217:30.07]It's the same room with the same scream.
[217:39.02]But my dad was hilarious.
[217:39.96]My father was... I mean, I would tell you that... I think I've said this before on stream, too, that I think my dad... is half the shit that I say.
[217:52.34]If you think that what I've said was funny at some point, it's probably me imitating my father at some point.
[218:01.65]He was the funniest dude in the room, always.
[218:14.83]But... Yeah, we don't have to spend too much time on it.
[218:18.93]I've just been trying to figure out maybe a way to even say it.
[218:23.84]But I didn't want to, you know... Not content, you know, it's just like... Something that happened.
[218:31.32]I think I did tell you guys that the last year had been kind of shitty.
[218:35.15]That was one of the things that was kind of shitty.
[218:39.35]Just because of the nature of how he was.
[218:43.31]So...
[218:57.37]But he had lung cancer and he had Parkinson's.
[219:02.04]So that's kind of... Not to go into super too much detail about it.
[219:12.82]But he was great.
[219:23.07]And I feel like I've told some recent stories about my dad, like, oh, he did this and he did that.
[219:27.56]And it's kind of like, eh, it's probably appropriate for me to say that because, I mean, that's info that I have that you don't necessarily have while I talk about some of the things that he's done that I think were funny.
[219:39.75]So I guess that was my opportunity to bring it up.
[219:50.81]Have I played the same level like three times?
[219:56.38]Did I die to Bebop?
[219:59.55]Dude, I have... Do you want to see how these games used to be?
[220:03.52]I've been looking over at the chat, holding right, and swinging.
[220:09.33]And I've kind of done okay.
[220:34.32]But that's probably the last I'll speak of it.
[220:36.16]I probably won't mention it very much.
[220:37.94]Because I'm one of those... I don't know.
[220:39.78]I don't really like talking about that kind of stuff anyways.
[220:43.85]I'd rather this stream be a place where we just chill, fuck around, have fun.
[220:48.22]I don't really talk about real life stuff too much.
[220:51.08]Or real life things too much.
[220:59.11]But yeah, this one's fun.
[221:02.48]...
[221:04.39]Wait, there was a Ninja Turtles 3?
[221:07.85]But what, the NES?
[221:16.28]Wow, that was a brain blast.
[221:27.55]Same sound effect.
[221:29.96]How is this Turtles 3?
[221:35.46]The turtles are enjoying their vacation on a beach in Flo- There's a TV over there.
[221:41.22]I see a TV on that table.
[221:45.19]No.
[221:45.81]Dude, they don't even get reception out here.
[221:47.23]How did Shredder get reception?
[221:54.13]Here in New York, crime is skyrocketing every day.
[221:59.07]That's not funny.
[222:00.27]Oh, here.
[222:01.10]This is what I was laughing at, because here it comes.
[222:06.05]Bummer dudes, it's Shredder.
[222:11.06]Oh, what did he do?
[222:18.25]Turtles, I'm taking April along with Manhattan Island.
[222:25.02]If you want them back, come and get them.
[222:40.34]It's actually on the beach, that's funny.
[222:53.43]Dude, get Squeaks on the line.
[222:55.34]We have to go through all these.
[222:56.50]It's late.
[223:09.06]Oh, well I mean in like a week.
[223:20.04]Okay, that's probably it.
[223:23.18]But there's plenty of content here.
[223:24.60]There's a lot of cool stuff to see.
[223:30.41]Behind the scenes.
[223:31.25]Original artwork?
[223:33.84]What?
[223:34.16]What?
[223:38.95]Wait, TMNT co-creator Heaven Eastman created this original art for the cover of the limited edition of TMNT The Cowabunga Collection.
[223:46.94]The scene depicts the events immediately following Shredder's kidnapping of April in TMNT arcade game between stages one and two.
[223:53.70]Well, that's cool.
[224:03.94]This is for this game.
[224:05.00]That's really cool.
[224:06.70]What is this one?
[224:07.88]Oh, black and white.
[224:12.33]Oh, he did this too.
[224:20.74]With a poster included with it.
[224:22.51]Where was this limited edition collection thing?
[224:26.69]Do they still exist?
[224:31.88]Why did I buy three of them?
[224:47.07]The original full-size artwork that was used for the TMNT 3 Radical Rescue US box design.
[224:58.12]It looks crazy.
[225:03.77]A clean text-free version of the TMNT 3 The Manhattan Project box art.
[225:09.19]Provided video game magazines for their use in creating page layouts.
[225:14.34]Ah, okay.
[225:25.24]Okay, do you guys think that the Ninja Turtles, so 500 years, a thousand years from now, will the Ninja Turtles be like Greek gods?
[225:38.94]Will people be hearing about this going, oh, whoa, yeah, those old gods.
[225:45.05]Michelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello, the Ninja Turtles.
[225:52.12]This is a reused bit.
[225:53.22]It's important.
[225:54.12]It's worth talking about.
[225:56.39]I like this one a lot.
[226:06.73]This one's amazing.
[226:07.49]I like them in a lot.
[226:11.77]Main menu art.
[226:21.76]Wait, what?
[226:24.86]There's an animated intro?
[226:26.26]Did we skip it?
[226:34.07]Wait a minute.
[226:51.13]I didn't skip it, did I?
[227:00.94]Oh, okay.
[227:22.02]I'll save one more thing.
[227:23.46]Wait, go back to the artwork.
[227:26.66]So that was the original artwork.
[227:27.82]Okay, what about style guide excerpts?
[227:31.38]What is this?
[227:40.53]What do these numbers mean?
[227:41.60]Is it color coded?
[227:50.75]What does it say up here?
[228:01.07]It's Pantone color codes.
[228:03.05]Oh, that's cool.
[228:05.85]160.
[228:25.93]160.
[228:28.85]What is 160?
[228:32.67]Let's go.
[228:45.71]What is this one?
[228:47.30]Concept document for the original NES game.
[228:53.45]It's in Japanese, you know this is authentic.
[229:01.93]That's cool.
[229:11.55]There's a lot of documents here.
[229:13.47]This is so cool.
[229:19.70]Oh, so is this the guy that I gotta blame for this part?
[229:27.06]This is his original document where he made this fucked up character.
[229:36.60]This is also back when you designed a level, drawing it on a piece of paper.
[229:46.23]That's crazy.
[229:52.80]They still do this though.
[229:53.97]Do they still do this?
[229:54.87]Do you still do that?
[229:55.63]You draw the level in like the blocks and stuff.
[230:02.28]I figured there was some in-game engine thing that could do that much easier now.
[230:06.94]Some devs do still.
[230:12.35]These are more like animation sequences.
[230:17.72]Oh, it's how long it is, and that's funny.
[230:20.22]Yeah, look at Donatello's.
[230:22.96]Look at everybody else.
[230:25.19]He may as well have like three yardsticks.
[230:32.76]I wish I could read this.
[230:33.60]Is this the swimming document?
[230:57.49]Game over, continue.
[231:01.50]This is so cool.
[231:08.50]Dude, what a relic, huh?
[231:10.86]Imagine... This is what's so crazy about all this.
[231:16.15]Imagine you just are writing, jotting stuff down in a book one day.
[231:22.02]Like, yeah, this is the thing I'm making.
[231:25.27]And it's, everything's a little, it's a little crude.
[231:28.93]And this is what turns into a thing that has a legacy that's like 30 plus years old.
[231:38.96]It's like, do you think this guy thought that this little drawing, this little box here with April going, hey, and just kind of, oh, I guess maybe it'll look like this.
[231:51.63]This is somebody's notebook that they just decided, I'm going to make something.
[231:56.62]We're making this game.
[232:00.28]That's so cool.
[232:03.27]But the way you drew that pizza is etched into the the annals of history.
[232:26.08]Look at that blimp.
[232:28.16]Cool.
[232:28.74]Oh wait, here's the actual layout.
[232:40.60]You know what's so funny?
[232:41.60]I've made one of these before.
[232:42.91]For the Dollhouse 2 stream that I wanted to do.
[232:49.44]The Dollhouse 2 stream was going to be a Dark Souls map.
[232:53.97]This is leak it fucking Thursday.
[232:55.75]Who cares?
[232:57.57]Leak it, Larry.
[232:58.24]I don't care.
[232:59.10]I'm not doing it.
[233:04.34]I wanted to have Dollhouse 2 whenever I was asked by, I've been asked by Twitch about this before, this was years ago, about like, oh, would you ever do a Dollhouse 2?
[233:12.24]I was like, no, absolutely not.
[233:15.14]What I would do is I would do Dollhouse 2, but it would be a Dark Souls game.
[233:19.55]It would be a full Dark Souls level.
[233:24.93]I wanted to make an entire like 10 to 20 set gigantic thing where I ran around and chat had to help me play and it was like a third person camera followed me around.
[233:37.44]In a huge level.
[233:41.57]Dollhouse Blighttown.
[233:42.59]That's what it would have been.
[233:43.29]It would have been something like that.
[233:56.37]Obstacle course escape room.
[233:59.17]Yeah, but I remember drawing one of these originally and just kind of what would I want?
[234:02.66]I want to go that way.
[234:03.56]If you went that way, what would happen over here?
[234:05.06]What would I have to deal with over here?
[234:09.80]Crazy expensive, yeah.
[234:12.29]Yeah.
[234:19.84]They have them all.
[234:20.58]Is Turtles in Time here?
[234:24.34]Dude, this is the...
[234:27.50]I just like found Jumanji upstairs.
[234:30.93]Are you serious?
[234:52.02]Somebody said, did he hack Nintendo servers or something?
[234:54.98]How did he get this?
[234:57.96]I love the erasing.
[235:04.11]You can see underneath.
[235:35.19]Bosses Animation Design Concept Document for Turtles in Time.
[235:42.24]There's a table of contents.
[235:46.09]Why can't I read Japanese?
[236:08.67]Dude, this is worth the price of admission alone just for all this stuff.
[236:13.62]Forget about the games that you get.
[236:14.84]I've never seen any of this stuff before.
[236:21.00]Can you even go look?
[236:21.78]Is this even available?
[236:22.84]Can you even go look this up?
[236:25.27]Maybe it exists somewhere.
[236:36.04]I mean, I'm imagining that Konami had all this stuff.
[236:40.81]Gameplay documents?
[236:45.61]Yeah, this is all the... Now, what does this mean, I wonder?
[236:49.19]Ah, this is... The different button sequences?
[236:54.34]...
[237:02.96]storyboards cool yeah look at this what I'm talking about like look at this it's so it's so crude but it's so cool I love it this was just a funny barrel
[237:32.91]Oh, is this Big Apple?
[237:35.87]This one's just saying, hey, a rock is going to fall at some point.
[237:53.33]Oh, that's right.
[237:53.95]Turtles in Time had the versus mode.
[237:57.74]I love the song for it.
[238:01.31]Let's go listen to it.
[238:02.85]And then I'm done.
[238:19.45]Yeah, this song is great.
[238:30.93]I'll turn it up.
[238:40.19]How do I press... Player 2.
[238:54.19]Right shift and enter.
[239:02.30]That didn't work.
[239:15.73]ZXC?
[239:30.28]Just go to the sound test.
[239:32.16]That's true.
[239:39.93]Where is it?
[239:42.69]No, that's not the right one.
[239:44.58]Don't play the arcade music.
[239:46.32]It isn't as good.
[239:57.65]Try hard mode?
[240:01.33]Yeah!
[240:32.66]I'd get kicked out of a sleepover over this.
[240:35.49]I just would.
[240:35.85]I would.
[240:52.54]How would you explain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to aliens?
[240:56.90]I'd simply say you better watch out.
[241:01.55]That's who we have defending Earth.
[241:02.77]I would show them all the Marvel movies and say, hey, be aware that we got this shit on lockdown.
[241:09.10]Do aliens know about CG?
[241:12.42]If we showed them the Superman movie and we said, don't fuck with us, look what happened to that guy, do you think they would go, oh my God, we need to be careful.
[241:22.94]They have supermen here that shoot lasers out of their eyes.
[241:27.36]Who's this Thanos?
[241:29.43]I've never heard of him in the intergalactic lexicon of dastardly villains, but he's here.
[241:36.42]Superman is an alien.
[241:45.21]Yeah, during the meeting with the aliens, do you show them Infinity War and say, hey, these are Earth's strongest heroes?
[241:59.32]You might want to lead with that, just to make sure, a show of force.
[242:09.95]Just be like, hey, we're very, we are a very, but look at what happened here.
[242:16.76]They lose in Infinity War.
[242:18.25]Well, you just show them the parts where Tony Stark is like shooting lasers and where Captain America throws Jolnir.
[242:26.59]And you say, that's the last guy that fucked with us.
[242:28.27]We've got Captain America.
[242:33.55]I feel like they, okay, if you didn't under, think about it.
[242:36.20]If you did not even understand the concept of faking something with computers, right?
[242:42.90]I mean, like CG and acting and actors and movies and television sets.
[242:49.57]That concept alone is, why would you ever think that that was possible?
[242:53.48]You would just think it was real.
[243:01.31]That's the plot of Galaxy Quest.
[243:03.50]I know.
[243:03.94]What a great movie.
[243:08.18]I'm not talking about Captain America to aliens.
[243:10.29]I will mention Superman or Goku.
[243:13.07]Yeah, but Goku is a cartoon.
[243:15.98]You can't show an alien a cartoon and go, look, that's real.
[243:18.88]He'd be like, well, why does he look like you?
[243:21.07]Why does he look like that?
[243:22.49]Why is he flat and colorful?
[243:26.15]Well, you know, I'm not... What do you mean?
[243:29.16]He's very clearly, he's not in three dimensions.
[243:32.16]And there's so many colors.
[243:33.44]Why are you not like that?
[243:36.37]No, you gotta show him Infinity War, man.
[243:38.75]Gotta show him the scene when Doctor Strange takes out all the guys and say, that's New York City, man.
[243:45.76]Don't fuck with us.
[243:49.11]Dude, Doctor Strange has a time stone on his neck.
[243:54.22]You better give us your medicine.
[243:57.24]You better give us your high-tech medicine shit.
[243:59.44]We have Doctor fucking Strange and Dormammu.
[244:02.98]We killed that guy.
[244:05.97]Are you guys as powerful as Dormammu?
[244:10.55]Silver Surfer tried to eat the planet, dude.
[244:12.66]We took care of that guy.
[244:15.08]We want to be peaceful with you, so give us all your alien medicine tech.
[244:28.47]If your Earth doctors are so powerful, then why do you need our medicine?
[244:32.95]For research.
[244:33.53]We're studying it.
[244:34.13]We want to study you.
[244:35.47]We want to see the... We could already cure that.
[244:37.58]It doesn't matter.
[244:39.24]We want to study what you have.
[244:55.91]Didn't you fall asleep to the end of all those movies?
[244:58.72]I'm not showing them the whole movie.
[245:01.38]They'll know that it's fiction then.
[245:05.77]You need to show them a kind of a weird... Okay, you got to show them, get it on an HD, HDR OLED, and just show them the fight against Thanos at the end when it's everybody running out.
[245:18.27]It's like, Avengers, let's go!
[245:20.11]It's like, that's how many motherfuckers we got.
[245:23.05]That's us.
[245:26.00]And just an ad on the bottom right, like KBVI news, right?
[245:31.79]Like just like a stamp, like a fake news with like an REC next to it.
[245:47.60]I would beg the aliens to blow us up.
[245:49.58]Why would you?
[245:50.08]No, you wouldn't.
[245:50.66]Why?
[245:57.07]Maybe you should watch these movies to remember what even happens in them.
[246:00.33]Two out of ten, Andy.
[246:01.51]Did I give it a two?
[246:09.31]I didn't fall asleep during them.
[246:10.65]I was like super into the Marvel movies.
[246:12.45]I did not fall asleep during Infinity War.
[246:19.42]You gave Infinity War a four.
[246:21.44]I didn't.
[246:22.37]You get that clip from me right now because I don't believe you.
[246:28.32]You told us that.
[246:30.42]I did?
[246:30.84]Why did I tell you that?
[246:32.55]Was I a liar?
[246:33.37]I was just making it up to make you laugh, probably.
[246:36.01]I told you that I fell asleep during Infinity War for the first time?
[246:41.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[246:51.99]It's coming back to me.
[246:54.22]Because I don't think I saw it in... I didn't see it in the theaters.
[246:57.15]Because I caught it way later.
[247:00.33]I saw Endgame in the theater.
[247:02.23]Didn't sleep.
[247:12.00]What Marvel movie was the one that made you check out?
[247:15.83]I don't know.
[247:20.45]Anything after Endgame has felt like New Game+.
[247:27.48]I don't care about anything after Endgame.
[247:29.63]I know people are going, oh, but there's other cool stuff.
[247:31.63]I don't.
[247:32.64]I mean... I really just don't care.
[247:48.98]The story I was invested in was over.
[247:52.71]Yeah, and I think that that's the problem that Marvel and Disney have with a lot of stuff right now is instead of making an investable story, they just threw a bunch of random fucking stories out after.
[248:06.29]They said, what about this person?
[248:10.56]What about that person?
[248:11.30]What about that universe?
[248:12.06]What about this one?
[248:12.66]What about that one?
[248:13.25]That one's cool too.
[248:21.35]It's like trying to make every video game an eSport.
[248:24.54]We are making this to be an, it is an eSports friendly.
[248:28.26]It is an eSport.
[248:30.13]Like just make a good game that people like and it'll just, people will do it.
[248:33.74]It'll happen.
[248:47.98]I'm trying to think of the last movie that I... No.
[248:50.90]I mean, WandaVision was okay.
[248:52.62]I feel like I pretended to like WandaVision because it was the first thing that came out after Endgame and everybody was waiting for what was going to happen next and we all collectively had mass hysteria liking it.
[249:10.70]Because I like it.
[249:12.88]But do I actually like it?
[249:14.80]Would I have actually liked it for real?
[249:26.84]Okay, if WandaVision came out last year, I feel like everybody would be like, oh man, what the fuck is this?
[249:35.77]Marvel junk.
[249:37.19]Oh, more of this crap.
[249:39.34]I think WandaVision was the one that they could have made, and then they should have just stopped and done other stuff.
[249:45.88]I feel like people would be annoyed with WandaVision if it came out right now.
[249:53.81]To be fair, I do remember enjoying WandaVision.
[249:55.96]I did like it.
[249:58.28]But is it because I was a big Infinity War saga fan, still haven't even seen Civil War, and haven't seen any of the Captain America movies, I am a bandwagon piece of dog shit?
[250:18.85]No, I didn't.
[250:19.27]No, I didn't.
[250:19.63]No, I saw Civil War.
[250:20.87]I saw Civil War.
[250:26.29]I'm the guy that shows up to the baseball game wearing the baseball hat for the Red Sox and the jersey for the Red Sox.
[250:36.18]And I'm so into it.
[250:37.81]I got my stats out on my phone.
[250:40.67]Oh, yeah, man.
[250:42.85]Pedro Martinez is fucking pretty good this year.
[250:47.32]And I can't name you any other players on the whole team.
[250:54.54]Like, I just want you to think that I know.
[251:07.70]Dude, the real, the real problem, the real problem is, is that how much time do you have?
[251:19.60]It's late.
[251:24.07]I just, I just, okay, I can word this away.
[251:32.32]Show us your lububu.
[251:33.33]I thought I banned that word from chat.
[251:45.58]There was a point where Star Wars and Marvel were cool.
[251:53.55]And then there was a point after where now I'm embarrassed to think that.
[252:00.72]Isn't that kind of annoying?
[252:08.77]Dude, I used to wear my Star War, I mean, I'm getting older, but I used to wear my Star War shirt out, like, yep, there he is.
[252:16.28]Hey, there's Luke.
[252:19.62]Luke Skywalker.
[252:26.09]And now I think about wearing that shirt and I go, ugh, everybody hates this now.
[252:30.76]I'm going to be like the cringe guy that has the Star Wars in 2025.
[252:34.97]Whoa, dude, what the fuck?
[252:41.76]funny story I wore a Star Wars shirt this is like four or five years ago I don't remember we said some hotel somewhere and I got I got it it was I got in late I think it was like traveling to la or something for something whatever it was and I got to the hotel late and I needed to get room service
[253:02.77]And it's like, oh, well, you have to order it at the bar because then you can just take it up.
[253:07.22]So it's like, okay, well, there's no room service, but I can just order it at the bar.
[253:09.98]So I go to the bar and I order, I've got like a chicken sandwich or whatever it was.
[253:13.97]And it's like, okay, it'll be ready in like 10, 15 minutes.
[253:15.67]Just hang out.
[253:17.01]There's a dude at the bar and he's, I guess he saw my Star Wars shirt.
[253:23.04]And he just kind of kept going like, Luke Skywalker.
[253:26.05]There he is.
[253:26.99]Luke.
[253:27.97]Hey, Luke Skywalker, huh?
[253:31.12]He was just kind of being like a dick.
[253:34.31]And I was like, yeah, yeah, I just plan.
[253:36.05]I don't care.
[253:36.37]The guy probably had a few drinks, whatever.
[253:38.95]And there was another guy with, I think with his wife or with a girl, not old couple, but like a little bit older than me, maybe about like five to 10 years.
[253:49.54]And he was just like, he got mad that that guy
[253:54.58]was giving me shit over my Star Wars shirt.
[253:57.12]I don't think this guy was a Star Wars fan or anything, but he was just like, hey, like, yeah, yeah, shut your fucking mouth.
[254:03.35]Like, I had nothing to do with anything.
[254:04.83]I had nothing going on.
[254:06.99]Like, I just wore a Star Wars shirt and it caused, like, a fight at a bar.
[254:15.58]I didn't do anything.
[254:16.80]I just, like, wanted to get food.
[254:22.05]I just walked in with a Star Wars shirt on and caused a problem.
[254:25.90]Just because I was wearing it.
[254:31.99]Anyways, I ended up getting my food.
[254:34.99]And the guy, like, they kind of went, they did like a back and forth.
[254:39.00]Like, yeah, whatever, dude.
[254:40.12]Like, I'm just fucking talking to him.
[254:42.30]Like, well, I don't think that's very respectful.
[254:43.94]And to be completely fair, the couple...
[254:48.60]was just like, hey man, like the guy's just trying to get food, like leave him alone.
[254:51.88]Like who cares?
[254:54.12]So like it was a very valid way to be like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[254:59.41]So I was leaving and as I was leaving, the guy was just like, oh, see you later, dude.
[255:06.06]Like he was just like drunk, whatever.
[255:07.96]And the guy pulled me aside.
[255:09.00]He's like, you know, I just want to say like, I just don't like when people do shit like that.
[255:12.68]I don't want people disrespecting people like that.
[255:14.50]And I was like, you know what?
[255:15.17]Hey, I appreciate that.
[255:15.99]Like, thank you.
[255:17.25]And as I was leaving, they started talking to each other again.
[255:20.81]Like, yeah, so what, you think you're such a smartass?
[255:23.45]And I'm just like, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[255:25.88]I'm just going to get, I'm going up to my room, and I'm not going to be here.
[255:29.16]I'm not going to be the guy that is, what am I going to do?
[255:35.50]It's like a huge fight at a bar or something, and the police come or whatever, and it's like, how are you involved again, sir?
[255:42.99]I wore a Star Wars shirt.
[255:48.47]Oh, okay.
[255:49.19]Can I take that whole statement from you?
[255:51.21]Yeah.
[255:53.19]I wore a Force Awakens shirt.
[255:57.84]That's it.
[255:58.60]That's the only thing that happened.
[256:05.19]Give him a life sentence.
[256:11.86]After the fact, though, I did think back and I was like, that's so funny.
[256:17.04]Somebody was just so annoyed or like just, and he wasn't even that bad.
[256:21.40]He was just kind of being like drunk and being like, oh man, what's up Luke?
[256:26.15]And I would just brush that off and be like, alright, whatever, dickhead.
[256:28.47]Like, I don't care.
[256:29.19]I'm getting my tuna sandwich and I'm going to fucking bed.
[256:34.82]It wasn't even a good Star Wars shirt.
[256:36.22]No, it was a, it was, I could show it to you.
[256:39.43]It was, it's the Force Awakens shirt that you've seen me wear like a thousand times.
[256:53.45]I need to watch Andor now.
[256:58.82]Was it a tuna sandwich or a chicken?
[257:00.18]I don't know.
[257:01.14]The details don't matter.
[257:02.18]What matters is I started a fight at a bar over my shirt that I had nothing to do with.
[257:20.00]Alright.
[257:20.27]I'll see you guys later.
[257:20.99]That's it.
[257:25.23]Kind of a long one tonight, but I did say I was going to be gone for a little while, so I'm okay doing a little bit of a longer one.
[257:44.58]What happened to the horseman?
[257:47.33]We played, we played, we almost beat Castle Crashers.
[257:50.11]We were just kind of yapping, having fun.
[257:55.52]But I'll see you guys later.
[257:56.56]I will be back next week, not the week coming up, the week after.
[258:00.68]So the week of the 18th, I'll be back.
[258:03.79]I don't know exactly what day, but I know that I'll be streaming at least a couple of times, at least two or three times that week.
[258:28.71]Yeah, dude.
[258:29.17]Turtle Week.
[258:36.73]You will see the Cowabunga collection again.
[258:38.63]100%.
[258:40.01]At least I'll play something with them.
[258:42.44]I know Squeaks and I were going to do Turtles in Time eventually.
[258:58.13]Play more Bioforge?
[258:59.19]I already beat it.
[259:00.47]What's the replayability of Bioforge besides speedrunning it or something?
[259:06.23]I don't know.
[259:17.43]Alright.
[259:18.15]See you later.
[259:21.27]Take care.
[259:21.87]If the horseman plays something without me... That's what I think about that.
[259:34.69]Alright, see you later, call you mother.
[259:37.42]You know the deal.
[259:40.72]Bye for now.
[259:47.11]Oh, I realized that pre-rolls were on the whole time, weren't they?
[259:49.57]It's fine.
[259:53.52]I guess I didn't think I was gonna stream for as long as I did after.
[260:02.75]It's not fine.
[260:06.67]It'll be fine.
[260:15.05]Dude, I didn't run any ads.
[260:17.25]What the fuck?
[260:22.04]Let me make up for it now.
[260:22.96]I'm going to run like 40 minutes.
[260:29.69]Alright, goodbye.
[260:38.87]you
[261:13.73]you
