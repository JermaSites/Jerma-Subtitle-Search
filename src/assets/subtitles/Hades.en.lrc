[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.20]What you guys don't know is when I press the go live button, so I'm you know I started somewhere around noon today, right one two four whatever it is I press the button and I fucking sprint out of here And I run out of the room and I finished the last second things that I need to do and I know I got like I know I got a minute or two before I have to talk
[00:25.73]If I have to go to the bathroom, or if I... Wait, I forgot to put ice in my coffee!
[00:29.78]This is red!
[00:33.50]And then I'm back here.
[00:34.16]You have no idea.
[00:35.02]You have no idea the chaos that happens.
[00:37.93]Two minutes before I start talking.
[00:39.53]Every day.
[00:44.19]He forgot to... No, I didn't.
[00:48.59]Just do it before you start.
[00:49.73]You have no idea.
[00:51.15]You have no idea.
[00:52.05]I do everything.
[00:52.71]I sit down.
[00:53.39]There's no ice in the coffee.
[00:55.65]Or... The coffee's at half.
[00:58.15]I gotta refill it.
[00:58.99]I'm not gonna start streaming without a full coffee.
[01:02.71]I gotta run down the stairs.
[01:05.29]But not spill it, you know?
[01:07.59]He's bullshitting us.
[01:14.17]You gotta sing the late song.
[01:18.07]What is this?
[01:21.81]What is this?
[01:22.35]I have to sign this?
[01:23.37]I don't want to sign this.
[01:35.64]Wait, this says... Let me read this to make sure I know what I'm doing.
[01:41.84]It says... Contract.
[01:43.74]Contract.
[01:45.88]I, Jeremy Elbertson, will not make any reference to The Binding of Isaac, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Dark Souls during this stream.
[01:56.84]If I do, I will gift five community subs per reference.
[02:04.33]That's kind of unfair.
[02:05.25]What do I get if I don't do it?
[02:08.67]What do I get if I don't do it?
[02:09.69]I'm not signing this.
[02:11.31]Where's my end of the deal?
[02:16.52]I get some debt removed?
[02:18.26]How much debt?
[02:19.00]This is important.
[02:21.00]100 million?
[02:21.32]No, it's gotta be more than that.
[02:24.45]200 million final offer.
[02:25.29]I'm not doing it.
[02:35.12]No deal.
[02:35.86]What do you mean deal?
[02:36.56]I've seen a lot more deals, but you have to sign it.
[02:38.84]Hold on.
[02:40.82]Yeah, alright.
[02:41.22]I'll sign it.
[02:43.77]I'm not signing it until... But hold on a minute.
[02:46.35]I need to be sure that this is going to wipe away $200 million.
[02:52.11]It's not even worth... It's not worth even $50 million.
[02:55.16]You know it.
[02:55.72]Are you kidding me?
[03:00.70]This is like the four games I talk about every single day.
[03:06.12]You are taking... Okay, let's say during any given stream, I say, I don't know, 10,000 sentences?
[03:15.51]You are deleting 4,000 sentences from my vocabulary.
[03:19.97]I'm gonna have to talk about something else.
[03:28.83]140 million?
[03:29.87]Take it or leave it.
[03:30.61]Alright, I'm taking it.
[03:31.61]I'll take it.
[03:31.99]140 million.
[03:32.19]Deal?
[03:32.29]Deal?
[03:40.53]Alright, how do I- I gotta sign this now.
[03:41.95]Alright, if I don't make any of these references during the stream, I get $140 million wiped away from that goddamn debt.
[03:50.51]Alright, I gotta sign it.
[03:51.43]Let me sign this.
[03:54.41]Okay, hold on.
[03:59.18]I'll sign it in just a second.
[04:05.88]Gotta get my pen out, I gotta get my pen out.
[04:18.01]Write that out real quick.
[04:18.91]Is that the same font that you used?
[04:26.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[04:27.44]I didn't even spell my name right.
[04:28.68]Hold on.
[04:31.06]Hold on.
[04:31.84]Let me rewrite that.
[04:32.70]There we are.
[04:40.18]I gotta get it in red ink.
[04:45.02]There you go.
[04:47.16]Signed it.
[04:49.04]Yeah, but don't forget about the amendment.
[04:53.11]That's at the end here.
[04:56.07]That I get $140 million wiped off the debt if I don't do this.
[05:04.26]Addendum.
[05:05.00]Whatever.
[05:05.30]Alright, I'm... No, I can't... Hey!
[05:11.96]I signed it.
[05:12.68]I'm not gonna say any of this shit.
[05:15.75]Um...
[05:17.58]Okay, so I remember I can't say any of these words.
[05:21.46]But hold on a minute.
[05:22.38]Let's talk about semantics here.
[05:24.77]It has to be, like, in quotes, those things.
[05:28.91]I can say the word... I can say the word... I can say the... I can't say these words at all.
[05:39.32]No, no, this is a reference to these games, not I can't say the word the.
[05:46.43]I have to be able to say the word world.
[05:49.76]That's unfair.
[05:50.62]These are references.
[05:52.64]Yes.
[05:52.92]Alright.
[05:53.24]I get it.
[05:53.60]Alright.
[05:54.24]It's been signed.
[05:55.78]I gotta keep this on my other monitor so I remember what games it is.
[05:58.52]Because I'm gonna be like, oh man.
[06:00.36]Oh, here's the enemy from... Never mind.
[06:03.53]I can't wait to not do this and just get 140 million shaved off.
[06:09.27]Alright.
[06:09.81]I got the games right here.
[06:10.61]Go.
[06:13.23]Go.
[06:15.43]Ah shit, I burnt it into my monitor.
[06:18.49]Oh well.
[06:20.57]That's just my watermark.
[06:24.33]Yeah, we're going to play Hades.
[06:27.96]Welcome everybody.
[06:28.68]Hope you had a good few days.
[06:35.54]OC, don't steal it.
[06:37.06]Don't steal it, it's mine.
[06:41.79]Put your name on top.
[06:44.75]No, I'm not gonna just put my name.
[06:47.35]Here's my name up top.
[06:52.25]That would be so weird.
[06:57.31]Like, I'm so desperate.
[06:58.61]I'm so, like, scared that somebody's gonna steal this stream or something.
[07:08.30]Why would you watermark a stream with your full name?
[07:17.03]Wouldn't it be a username or a production industry or company or something?
[07:20.71]Uh, we got... We got community subs.
[07:27.53]Ten, uh, to be exact.
[07:30.89]By an anonymous gifter.
[07:32.09]Don't know who it is.
[07:33.09]But that's actually your name on Twitch.
[07:35.07]So we know who you are, but we don't know who's behind the mask.
[07:40.34]Thanks for the ten subs.
[07:42.56]And we also had five subs from Ruined Bloodline.
[07:46.60]Thank you for the five community subs.
[07:52.07]Both of you guys, back to back there.
[07:53.53]Thank you.
[07:57.59]Has he played this before?
[07:58.67]I have never played Hades before.
[08:01.11]The title of the stream should tell you all you need to know.
[08:04.63]I saw that it was nominated for Game of the Year.
[08:06.41]It's been recommended a bunch of times and I didn't play it, so this is a Game of the Year nominated bandwagon stream.
[08:14.74]Well, I guess it got nominated for Game of the Year, so I'm gonna play it, I guess.
[08:18.34]I did the same thing with Celeste.
[08:19.42]So, you know.
[08:25.40]That's what we do here.
[08:29.82]Apparently it's very, very good.
[08:34.05]Very good from what I understand.
[08:35.37]Oh my god, please don't turn the camera on.
[08:38.65]Okay, good.
[08:45.57]Hey, easy cash.
[08:47.21]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[08:50.43]Easy cash.
[08:52.71]Another 10.
[08:55.67]I'm ready.
[08:56.75]I think the settings are good.
[08:57.63]I turned off screen shake.
[08:59.71]Screen shake, in my opinion, should be something you have to turn on, not turn off.
[09:06.15]I don't know who likes it.
[09:07.33]I don't think I've met a single person that actually likes to use screen shake.
[09:10.81]It's weird, right?
[09:16.08]Does anyone like it?
[09:17.66]It just hurts your head.
[09:21.88]What about the wisdom music?
[09:23.72]It's on?
[09:25.51]Am I echoing?
[09:26.75]Okay, no, that's just the, okay, never mind.
[09:30.07]It's on?
[09:30.69]It's very low.
[09:33.06]It's alright.
[09:33.80]I turned it on.
[09:36.08]I don't like music in my ears loud.
[09:38.10]I'm telling you.
[09:38.58]You guys already know that.
[09:41.52]It distracts me.
[09:42.58]I drive a car silent.
[09:45.18]I play games in silence.
[09:49.75]Put on god mode?
[09:50.67]Why?
[09:50.87]Okay.
[09:54.69]Music's so good.
[09:55.43]Alright, and you'll be able to hear it slightly.
[09:59.89]And on God mode, you're going to need it.
[10:01.19]Well, that's a great opinion of yours that you can have until I don't get hit one time in the first hour of the stream.
[10:08.20]And I'm willing to bet... Okay, I was going to say a bunch of... Wait, I can't say these words.
[10:16.64]No more bets.
[10:17.46]Let's go.
[10:20.16]What is Hell mode?
[10:20.98]I don't even want to see what it is.
[10:23.47]I'm just going to go.
[10:26.59]Oh, if I get hit in the first hour of the game, I'm gonna go.
[10:31.13]That's it.
[10:31.35]Okay.
[10:31.65]Is that us?
[10:32.07]Oh wow, this is weird.
[10:55.03]This is weird.
[10:56.05]This top, like this angle and the colors.
[11:01.57]Can't hear anything.
[11:02.27]Yeah, you can.
[11:03.39]You can hear it.
[11:04.30]I know you can hear it.
[11:06.98]There.
[11:07.24]Is that better?
[11:11.70]Wait, okay, let's go.
[11:12.44]Alright, the combat's pretty fluid.
[11:16.86]So this is like a... You know what's not on this list?
[11:22.22]Diablo II is not on this list.
[11:25.28]You really fucked it up, didn't you?
[11:27.81]You didn't fuck it up, did you?
[11:29.05]Oh, you did, actually.
[11:29.79]You fucked it up bad.
[11:36.35]Alright, alright, I get it.
[11:39.45]You cannot add anything by the way.
[11:41.23]There's a dash.
[11:41.85]There's a, there's a roll.
[11:45.39]Like in, um... Kinda like that game.
[11:49.60]Uhhh... Splinter Cell?
[12:01.69]Is there a dodge roll in Splinter Cell?
[12:07.54]Now it's too loud.
[12:08.30]You see?
[12:08.70]I'm telling you.
[12:09.31]You guys are Goldilocks-ing this.
[12:12.35]Alright, here we go.
[12:13.23]I'm going to turn the music up and the sound down.
[12:17.21]Check this out.
[12:17.57]Ready?
[12:18.35]Sound down.
[12:19.99]Music up.
[12:22.12]How's that?
[12:29.40]Alright, dude.
[12:29.74]Has it been an hour yet?
[12:31.28]It's been like an hour.
[12:32.10]I haven't even gotten touched once.
[12:34.53]It's been an hour.
[12:40.59]Plays very good, though.
[12:41.61]I like it.
[12:41.95]Do I have to break everything?
[12:46.49]This is like an arena... Oh.
[12:55.14]Is it an arena game?
[12:55.88]Oh, okay.
[12:56.14]Accept.
[12:56.32]What the hell is Zogorus?
[13:15.17]This is Athena.
[13:15.51]Athena and Zogorus.
[13:16.03]Did they make up this guy's Zogorus?
[13:18.01]I thought this was supposed to be Hades, isn't it?
[13:36.87]Okay, choose one.
[13:38.08]Bonus of Athena.
[13:39.64]Divine, your attack is stronger and can deflect 40% more attack damage?
[13:44.26]You serious?
[13:45.92]Okay, your cast damage is foes in a small area and can deflect.
[13:50.06]85.
[13:50.66]Your dash deals damage and can deflect.
[13:52.82]Hmm.
[13:52.98]I think we're gonna have to go with Divine Strike.
[13:56.73]Press or hold X to use your main weapon.
[13:59.47]And we can deflect.
[14:01.53]The dash.
[14:02.13]The dash.
[14:02.63]Dash.
[14:03.05]Awful.
[14:03.41]Awful.
[14:03.71]Awful.
[14:03.99]What?
[14:04.19]I don't know.
[14:05.33]Your dash deals damage.
[14:07.95]Alright, let's try it.
[14:11.20]Oh, it does a different animation too.
[14:17.10]The reflect is good.
[14:20.27]Alright.
[14:21.35]Oh, it does 10 damage.
[14:22.47]That's pretty good.
[14:23.85]I do 20 damage to swing.
[14:24.95]That's 50% damage just from dashing.
[14:27.75]Oh, that's a trap.
[14:28.35]I didn't know there were traps in this game.
[14:30.60]How was I supposed to know?
[14:35.50]I'm getting booed.
[14:36.28]Why am I getting booed?
[14:39.97]Stop booing me.
[14:40.85]For what?
[14:43.17]What did I do?
[14:43.71]Alright, should I try deflecting?
[14:46.27]Gain one key.
[14:53.21]Oh, I kind of like this game.
[14:59.99]I like this game.
[15:00.93]This game's pretty good.
[15:02.35]It's pretty fun so far.
[15:03.53]I hope they don't drop the ball in the end zone.
[15:06.83]Okay, each... What do the symbols mean?
[15:12.73]Okay, what's the steering wheel versus the pitchfork?
[15:16.78]Alright, I'm gonna go steering wheel.
[15:19.50]I'm gonna go ship steering wheel.
[15:21.34]Alright, concentrate.
[15:31.93]Okay, I see that the things pop up over their heads.
[15:33.67]Is it like Batman?
[15:34.53]Are they about to shoot me?
[15:45.01]Like Batman when it's like the indicator pops over their head and I have to press Y to block it.
[15:55.53]Like I can deflect it to here it goes.
[15:56.83]He's about to shoot you.
[16:00.37]There we go.
[16:01.29]Bad ending.
[16:02.77]Bugsnax and Hades.
[16:04.22]Banger stream and banger stream.
[16:06.12]Thanks, man.
[16:09.02]So this is an upgrade.
[16:09.96]Okay, so this is a Boon of Athena.
[16:11.46]So that's what that steering wheel... Ooh, this is an epic one.
[16:13.84]What's that?
[16:17.18]This is different rarities?
[16:21.98]Your cast damages foes in a small area and can deflect.
[16:24.24]So that's a different move.
[16:27.68]Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed.
[16:33.69]Shit, so I can wait hold on a minute.
[16:35.69]Don't don't look at the flashy purple letters.
[16:38.45]I can dash through people and hit them in the back This is 90% damage reduced from traps I don't want that.
[16:51.18]I mean, I'm sure it'll be useful for me Because I'm 90% damage is good.
[16:57.67]Yeah, but if I step on stuff all the stuff.
[16:59.47]Oh, yeah, that's probably good for me But I want this one
[17:04.16]Because I can go wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.
[17:07.58]I'm already making a build.
[17:08.64]I don't need your advice.
[17:12.36]I had over like 300 days played on Team Fortress 2.
[17:20.20]I know how to make loadouts.
[17:21.82]I know how to make a character look good.
[17:23.48]I know how to make a character strong.
[17:32.18]I gotta be careful.
[17:32.86]I'll slip up there.
[17:33.58]I will.
[17:36.66]That's a TF2 reference.
[17:37.52]Yeah, it sure is.
[17:38.24]Not on that list, though, is it?
[17:39.34]Get out of the way.
[17:42.37]I'm trying to do the thing.
[17:43.15]What the fuck does that do?
[17:46.61]Oh, nice.
[17:48.05]Nice.
[17:48.45]Alright, cool.
[17:49.01]This game's pretty good.
[17:53.63]Oh, I like it.
[17:59.51]It's juggles.
[18:01.71]Wait, what is that?
[18:02.11]Alright, there's one more fact.
[18:08.55]Backstab, backstab, backstab.
[18:14.67]Juggles the Great.
[18:17.01]Oh, I got hit.
[18:25.64]You can cleave too?
[18:26.64]Ooh, gain 10 what?
[18:29.80]What's that?
[18:30.12]10 what?
[18:31.52]Plus 10.
[18:34.18]The Clash of Clans currency?
[18:35.68]Thank God I didn't say any one of those four games.
[18:46.61]This is going to be way harder than I thought.
[18:48.32]I need health.
[19:01.54]I have to be so careful.
[19:04.21]Alright, let's pull.
[19:05.15]Don't just be an idiot.
[19:06.03]Pull one at a time.
[19:07.19]This game is a hard game.
[19:08.13]It's not an easy game.
[19:10.51]No, I don't want three of you.
[19:11.51]I just want one.
[19:15.32]How did you hit me?
[19:16.20]What?
[19:16.62]Really?
[19:19.52]Do not spawn!
[19:25.58]Oh shit, I'm in trouble.
[19:26.50]Alright.
[19:30.99]Oh!
[19:31.07]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[19:34.01]Oh my god, we're not good.
[19:35.01]We're not good.
[19:35.65]Wait, can I go over to the traps?
[19:38.97]Use your special?
[19:39.73]I didn't know I even had one.
[19:44.09]What?
[19:49.15]Why?
[19:49.49]I don't even know what that... I didn't know I even had this move.
[20:01.74]Is this a Reddit game?
[20:02.76]Probably.
[20:06.10]Just because you said it was.
[20:09.20]If you... Hey, don't you know?
[20:10.28]If you think it's a Reddit game, it's a Reddit game.
[20:12.69]You wouldn't even have that.
[20:13.43]You wouldn't even think that it's a Reddit game.
[20:15.19]If there was any doubt.
[20:20.70]there's only one heavenly archer I know of it's a Twitter game hold on a minute anyway in the name of Hades olympus I accept this message I had to clear my throat alright so this is a new message I've heard about you Artemis I'm not like all the others on olympus the power of the hunt helps keep me company so maybe it'll help you too
[20:42.67]Use the fucking buttons.
[20:44.43]Look, I don't know.
[20:45.85]They didn't tell me I had a heavy attack.
[20:48.97]It started five minutes ago.
[20:51.27]It just started five minutes ago.
[20:55.11]You don't tell the kid on his first day of culinary school he has to make a wedding cake.
[21:00.41]And if it's not the best wedding cake that the teacher's ever eaten, then he's going to just get kicked out of school.
[21:04.25]That's not how this works.
[21:06.43]Ooh, wait a minute.
[21:12.76]Any damage you do has a chance to be crit.
[21:13.94]Alright, so this is just... Like, fuck this thing.
[21:16.03]This thing's way better.
[21:20.77]15% crit.
[21:21.93]Or I just get 3% crit.
[21:24.95]That's terrible.
[21:25.81]Alright, we're doing Deadly Strike.
[21:31.88]That's...
[21:34.81]The double cube for boon info.
[21:38.45]Oh, okay.
[21:41.62]This just shows you everything you have.
[21:46.24]That's helpful.
[21:47.68]It's a fucking cursed link.
[21:49.90]Hold on.
[21:50.44]Let's take a look at whatever this cursed link is.
[21:53.49]I'll be the judge of that.
[21:54.73]Yep.
[22:05.95]Which path?
[22:09.47]Wait, this means there's a boss there.
[22:11.72]And this means health.
[22:17.90]I'm getting health.
[22:25.52]Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[22:29.16]Kill, kill, kill.
[22:33.56]That's pretty clean.
[22:34.50]Time to collect.
[22:37.22]That's not that much health at all.
[22:38.28]That's no health.
[22:39.12]That's none.
[22:39.90]That's zero health.
[22:47.48]That's 25 health?
[22:48.36]I thought that was gonna be like a full heal.
[22:51.78]Oh, these are elites!
[22:52.74]They absorb my blow.
[22:59.77]How could they?
[23:08.38]I just saw somebody say the word, and I was like, you know what?
[23:12.50]What's gonna happen?
[23:14.38]Come, wretches.
[23:22.76]Ooh, starting to have to pay more attention to things.
[23:25.92]Ooh.
[23:32.22]What's wrong with me?
[23:32.86]Why is my character being weird?
[23:37.18]Is the game good?
[23:37.94]Yeah.
[23:39.08]So far, I mean, I'm in the first zone.
[23:41.16]I'm assuming it's gonna get way harder.
[23:47.88]You have controller drift?
[23:49.60]Is that true?
[23:58.73]I gotta use Y more often.
[23:59.73]It's good.
[24:05.93]Alright, let's go.
[24:06.35]Bring it on.
[24:11.21]Shoot me.
[24:13.03]Awww.
[24:19.99]Come over here.
[24:22.89]Game is low?
[24:23.75]It's not.
[24:24.47]I can see how loud it is right now.
[24:27.32]It's very loud.
[24:28.38]Ooh, what's this?
[24:32.46]Pomegranate versus bag of treasure.
[24:35.58]Hmm.
[24:39.12]I'm gonna say bag of treasure.
[24:43.44]Hurts my ears.
[24:48.41]Do it louder.
[24:48.93]We can take it.
[24:51.27]I don't think you can take it.
[24:54.79]Oh.
[24:54.97]Hold on.
[24:58.82]I get the McDonald's.
[25:00.56]I get the Travis Scott meal.
[25:03.38]Or a pomegranate.
[25:04.12]What do I want?
[25:10.75]Nobody liked that one.
[25:12.05]Some of you did.
[25:12.71]Some of you did.
[25:13.21]Did I get the pomegranate?
[25:14.24]I don't even know what it was to do.
[25:18.32]Palm of power.
[25:22.84]Okay, I just get to pick an upgrade?
[25:26.96]Oh, wait.
[25:27.48]You can up these upgrade?
[25:31.14]That's pretty cool.
[25:33.64]Okay, so dash deals damage and can deflect.
[25:35.94]So this just increases the damage.
[25:39.53]Bonus backstab.
[25:40.47]70%.
[25:43.58]I think I have to do this one.
[25:46.50]That's so much more.
[25:47.24]Who's this guy?
[25:48.98]This is... Charon.
[25:53.10]Charon.
[25:55.22]Charon.
[25:55.60]Guys, I haven't... I don't know.
[25:57.42]Look, I know like... I know...
[26:10.91]The only reason why I know these characters is because of Smite.
[26:14.87]You know?
[26:15.99]Mercury!
[26:17.35]He's probably in the game.
[26:18.85]Hades.
[26:20.51]Uh... Artemis.
[26:24.75]Uh... Athena.
[26:27.51]Uh... This is not a... Okay, no.
[26:33.80]Play Smite?
[26:34.80]Is the game still fun?
[26:36.68]Or did they ruin it?
[26:37.98]They could've.
[26:40.44]Zeus.
[26:41.64]Yeah, all those Greek gods.
[26:45.10]Zeus, Athena, Tiny Tim.
[26:46.08]Alright, well, I got what I wanted.
[26:47.16]Tiny Timicus.
[27:07.96]They added the Ninja Turtles.
[27:09.19]Yeah, I know.
[27:10.75]We already talked about it.
[27:12.07]I'm already very upset about it.
[27:17.39]I gotta backstab to do more damage.
[27:23.79]Why even deflect?
[27:24.85]They have a little shield.
[27:25.67]Who cares?
[27:26.11]Just smash them.
[27:35.48]You gotta do a bake stave.
[27:37.74]There it is.
[27:38.34]93 damage.
[27:38.72]Pretty good.
[27:44.99]I like this game.
[27:45.75]I think I'm pretty good too.
[27:46.79]I think I'm pretty good.
[28:01.53]I think I'm pretty good.
[28:04.89]You can always tell, right?
[28:08.49]In a game where I don't know what the fuck's going on and I'm really bad, I usually would be just walking around getting hit by random projectiles going, hey, wait, what did this one do?
[28:23.26]Coin from the dead.
[28:25.00]Gain 100 coins.
[28:28.38]You can dash over... I missed it.
[28:31.56]Somebody said something important.
[28:36.58]Alright, so I don't have a key.
[28:38.79]What?
[28:38.95]Where's my key list?
[28:42.19]I can either get purple currency or go key.
[28:46.75]Dash over what?
[28:47.73]You can dash over gaps.
[28:50.14]Oh, can I fall in gaps?
[28:54.26]You cannot fall in gaps.
[28:55.66]Thank God.
[28:57.44]Um, let's stay consistent.
[28:58.52]I want the purple stuff.
[29:03.46]That's what they're called?
[29:09.68]Just smash everything.
[29:15.42]I'm gonna have to drink a little bit more coffee for this game.
[29:23.29]I thought this was a family-friendly screen.
[29:31.43]It is.
[29:33.53]Your family is psychos.
[29:35.29]You know, I will say, here's an automatic plus one letter grade.
[29:44.31]Hold on, stop, stop, stop talking.
[30:02.24]Hold on, stop talking.
[30:08.29]I didn't know I could do that oh my god why did I look at chat that was stupid okay uh this gets automatically plus one letter grade because uh it telegraphs where the enemy is going to come up next in the spawn and it's there for a full second or so absolute plus one letter grade I'm gonna die
[30:37.07]How can I get health?
[30:37.89]Shop probably, right?
[30:39.47]Yeah, you can talk.
[30:39.95]Good.
[30:46.09]Ooh.
[30:47.57]How much do I have?
[30:48.09]Alright, what heals more?
[30:49.85]The food?
[31:01.14]Alright, hold on.
[31:02.88]I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding.
[31:06.07]Oh, this is max health.
[31:08.07]I was wondering why 25.
[31:09.29]I was like, why is this so much more expensive?
[31:10.85]Okay.
[31:13.29]That's max health.
[31:15.39]I get it.
[31:15.83]And then this is a super upgrade.
[31:17.39]I don't have enough money for the super upgrade, though.
[31:20.15]Please drink a sprite on stream.
[31:34.83]No, I don't want to.
[31:35.67]I only drink sprites on airplanes.
[31:40.23]And I can reckon quite a bit.
[31:41.67]Alright, I'm good.
[31:52.79]Ginger ale or pineapple juice.
[31:55.11]Well, this is awkward.
[31:56.03]Uh oh.
[31:57.56]Boss fight.
[31:59.76]Not one step further.
[32:01.12]Omega lull.
[32:02.08]It's omega mega.
[32:04.54]Oh, Zagoras.
[32:05.42]Not one step further.
[32:06.32]This character's not in Smite.
[32:07.46]I don't know who this is.
[32:11.55]That's the problem.
[32:12.23]Zagoras and Omega Mega are not in Smite, so I don't know.
[32:16.37]They may as well not exist.
[32:24.42]Your father sent me.
[32:25.82]All in all, I'd rather be on your bad side than his.
[32:28.80]Now you can turn back.
[32:30.18]And a education.
[32:31.66]Or I can send you home the painful way.
[32:34.17]What'll it be?
[32:35.09]No, the true Twitch education here would be... Hey, give me a tier list.
[32:40.81]I'm gonna do a tier list of the Greek and Roman gods.
[32:46.85]I'll have to go with the painful way.
[32:50.77]A man after my own heart.
[32:54.22]Oh, this is a fight.
[32:54.84]Alright, I'm ready.
[32:55.40]Three, two, one, go!
[33:05.07]Oh, that hurt!
[33:16.35]You get to summon guys?
[33:17.39]That's not fair.
[33:21.55]Where is she?
[33:21.95]Where is she?
[33:22.25]What's she doing?
[33:24.80]I'm gonna die.
[33:25.42]I'm dead.
[33:28.38]You fucking asshole.
[33:30.69]I'm dead.
[33:33.07]I'm dead.
[33:44.90]Okay, so I'm gonna be very, very clear.
[33:48.06]I lost that because I was so trying so hard to not say I have to treat this like... I was concentrating on not saying a sentence versus playing the game.
[34:06.77]It's scripted anyways.
[34:11.78]It's scripted.
[34:13.18]Look, you're supposed to die.
[34:14.81]Some of us more than others.
[34:15.75]Probably me.
[34:16.25]Some of us more than other streamers.
[34:18.89]Like the 180 attempts I had at Cuphead.
[34:19.83]See if I come close this time.
[34:21.51]Back already?
[34:47.96]Who's this?
[34:49.76]Oh, there he is.
[34:50.30]I know viewers are leaving.
[34:51.72]It's Bugleberry.
[34:52.41]Father?
[34:52.59]Father?
[35:14.14]Pet the dog.
[35:14.48]Of course you can pet the dog in Hades.
[35:17.70]Yeah, that's Cerberus.
[35:18.46]Probably gonna have to fight this dog later.
[35:23.47]That's the ultimate betrayal.
[35:42.61]Okay, so who are these people?
[35:43.53]You have come home.
[35:45.17]Do not despair, child.
[35:46.55]Oh, I know her.
[35:48.07]I know Nyx.
[35:48.53]She has the candle and smite.
[35:50.35]And with time, we made contact with the goddess Athena.
[35:53.89]She shall be true to her word.
[35:58.61]I believe it, Nyx.
[35:59.95]I'm grateful that you put us into contact.
[36:02.29]I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.
[36:06.72]The risk is not to me.
[36:08.94]I expected the Olympians would involve themselves in this eventually.
[36:12.16]Honeyjunk.com game?
[36:13.50]Reveal to them no more than they already know.
[36:16.04]What the hell are you talking about?
[36:17.06]Are we understood?
[36:20.80]Yes, we are.
[36:22.78]Then go.
[36:25.24]You need to address horny chat.
[36:28.51]You know, I gotta make a statement here.
[36:30.47]Can I just say, I don't know what happened.
[36:32.29]I think it was since the great ass revealing.
[36:35.19]You guys are, I'd say, like, plus 40% hornier than, like, a year ago.
[36:42.25]Is that what happened?
[36:50.25]What's going on here?
[36:51.23]Stop saying that.
[36:53.15]It's November.
[36:54.16]Oh, well.
[37:06.87]I'm not gonna even respond to that.
[37:10.79]You watch over things for me, won't you, boy?
[37:13.25]You know I'd take you if I could.
[37:18.92]Non-stop something something in this month.
[37:24.06]That's fucking ridiculous.
[37:27.96]You've returned.
[37:30.80]Who are all these people?
[37:33.20]Oh, Achilles!
[37:37.08]This is the reason why your heel is named after this guy.
[37:39.50]Because he had a bad foot.
[37:43.53]And during one of the wars, he twisted his ankle and it got stomped on or something.
[37:53.45]That's wrong.
[37:54.23]I have no idea.
[37:58.86]And fear is for the weak.
[38:00.88]Take care, Achilles.
[38:06.11]These are random ghosts.
[38:10.11]You should play Smite.
[38:11.97]You know, I would play Smite on stream if it wasn't guaranteed.
[38:15.73]I'd get like 10% viewership and 100% embarrassment.
[38:22.86]Oh, so these are all my trinkets.
[38:25.44]Ooh.
[38:25.54]Relax?
[38:25.86]Well, you can just relax.
[38:27.22]Oh, why not?
[38:27.74]That's pissing me off.
[38:29.60]Okay, cool.
[38:57.35]So what does this person do is this do I is there like permanent upgrades it is a roguelike What is it now?
[39:07.37]There are no permanent upgrades there are oh I didn't say I didn't make any reference Hey room, I'm back
[39:24.47]Use the mirror to grow stronger.
[39:26.45]Oh, man.
[39:30.47]That's what the Clash of Clans... $10 for 100 gems is for.
[39:37.44]Deal bonus attack and special damage when striking foes from behind per rank.
[39:44.83]Unlock talents?
[39:47.05]Oh, this is never-ending.
[39:48.29]I'm going to be so happy about this.
[39:50.48]Restore a small amount of health when you exit a chamber.
[39:53.00]One health.
[39:53.90]That's not good.
[39:56.44]Restore 50% instead of dying when your life is depleted.
[40:00.10]Why would you not do this immediately?
[40:05.29]Oh, because the next rank is 500.
[40:06.49]Okay.
[40:06.67]I'm probably going to say this one.
[40:09.71]No.
[40:12.33]Yeah.
[40:13.71]10% more damage and special damage from behind.
[40:22.20]He fucked it up.
[40:22.98]What?
[40:23.72]How did I fuck it up?
[40:27.14]So that's why.
[40:27.76]Yeah, you're not supposed to just beat it quickly in one go.
[40:30.68]You gotta get better and get stronger.
[40:32.45]Speedrun.
[40:32.63]Speedrun.
[40:46.05]Why does every character in this game talk like the new Castlevania Netflix series?
[40:50.49]Where if you don't have subtitles, you can't understand a fucking word anybody's saying.
[40:56.98]Oh, what?
[41:01.30]What happened?
[41:02.48]Rewind that and put subtitles on.
[41:06.84]I'll sleep when I'm dead.
[41:15.95]That's pretty morbid, dude.
[41:19.51]You're painfully American.
[41:22.99]No, it's like the audio, too.
[41:24.75]Like, the volume of the speaking is too low.
[41:29.17]They'll be like riding on a carriage and talking, and the carriage is like... Whoa, what's all this?
[41:44.35]Oh, this is new weapons.
[41:47.71]This is a new starting weapon?
[41:51.67]What the fuck is all this stuff?
[41:57.71]Okay.
[41:57.91]This is a lot here.
[42:00.39]Use to unlock a weapon.
[42:02.23]What is this weapon?
[42:02.99]I'm doing it.
[42:03.37]It's a... Cool.
[42:04.39]Hold to...
[42:15.46]Wait.
[42:17.84]Oh, shit.
[42:19.40]Nice place you got here, boyo.
[42:21.05]Name Skelly, how's it going?
[42:22.35]But enough with the smart talk already.
[42:23.91]I'm here to do a job.
[42:25.15]So let me have it.
[42:25.89]Give me everything you got.
[42:27.77]Okay.
[42:29.91]I don't remember having you on payroll, mate.
[42:32.26]Who's your supervisor?
[42:33.16]Sans.
[42:33.82]No, not every single skeleton is one of those two.
[42:38.14]Just try and beat it out of me.
[42:40.69]Okay, so let's see.
[42:42.86]Press to fire a volley.
[42:45.24]It's a spread?
[42:45.98]That's awesome.
[42:47.66]Okay.
[42:49.50]Can I just shoot normally?
[42:50.54]No, you have to.
[42:51.22]You have to hold it.
[42:52.90]So release while flashing for a power shot.
[42:56.20]So it has to be like that.
[42:57.47]Okay.
[42:58.61]You gotta time it.
[43:03.05]Now what's this other one?
[43:03.85]Dashing?
[43:04.29]I need that again.
[43:06.47]I can dash to what?
[43:10.89]What'd it say?
[43:20.29]Dash plus attack.
[43:22.63]Like together?
[43:24.15]Oh, you can like slide into it.
[43:31.11]Dash attack is faster charge.
[43:35.15]Is it?
[43:35.37]Oh, it kind of is.
[43:41.84]You're just going to softlock the game by killing the skeleton.
[43:46.34]Thank you.
[43:52.61]That's pretty good.
[43:56.41]I like this.
[43:56.81]I'm going to try it.
[44:02.15]NicoCat gave $50 right now.
[44:06.02]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[44:08.88]Stop saying swears to your children watching.
[44:12.49]They say, Jerma, since you've watched the Castlevania show, do you think you would ever play Castlevania on stream?
[44:16.75]Maybe Symphony of the Night.
[44:20.11]Oh.
[44:23.71]I don't know.
[44:25.67]Maybe one day.
[44:26.38]Wait, did I miss anything over here?
[44:28.94]Is there anything cool I can do here?
[44:31.90]Let me just look.
[44:34.45]I can do this.
[44:35.45]Oh.
[44:36.33]I'll figure something out.
[44:38.05]No, I don't.
[44:38.79]Don't.
[44:38.99]Don't.
[44:39.35]No.
[44:40.49]No, I... No turning back.
[44:42.49]I don't know.
[44:46.47]I never was a big fan of Castlevania.
[44:49.52]Thunder.
[44:50.62]Is that... Thunder?
[44:52.50]Is this really him?
[44:54.74]Okay.
[44:55.30]Oh, Zeus.
[44:56.02]In the name of Hades, Olympus, I accept this message.
[45:00.32]So what can I do?
[45:00.84]I get an upgrade, right?
[45:01.86]Santa.
[45:02.14]Ooh, we get a blessing.
[45:02.94]Thunder.
[45:03.30]Your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes.
[45:06.50]Chain lightning that bounces between people.
[45:32.27]Or, your dash causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes.
[45:35.73]I think I want this one.
[45:40.37]That replaces the thing I had before?
[45:43.51]It's Y, right?
[45:50.05]I love the ball already.
[45:51.01]Like, I'm only going to use the ball.
[45:52.65]I'm not going to use another weapon for the rest of the game.
[46:02.44]So wait, isn't this supposed to do... Your special class is a bolt to strike nearby foes.
[46:07.65]Wait, it did... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:09.91]Did I fucking ruin that?
[46:12.80]I messed that up?
[46:15.42]There's lore over there.
[46:16.32]Okay, look.
[46:18.10]Hades is in the underworld.
[46:20.82]Ares, like, fights back against his parents.
[46:24.55]Hades, I'm fighting against my parents.
[46:26.79]All the Zeus' kids.
[46:27.69]What's his name?
[46:30.73]Not Omega.
[46:32.91]Odin.
[46:33.55]All the kids fight against Odin.
[46:35.45]It's sons versus their parents.
[46:37.97]Daughters versus their parents.
[46:39.64]And all these Greek and Roman games.
[46:44.34]And, like, Norse, it doesn't matter.
[46:46.00]It's just the sons versus the parents.
[46:50.68]Look, I'll spell it out even better for a lot of you Zoomers in the chat here.
[46:54.34]Okay, so imagine a YouTube thumbnail with a red, green, and blue sectioned off area.
[47:00.86]And Zeus, no, sorry, Odin, Loki, and Thor are doing a colored food challenge video.
[47:08.75]Where they have to eat only one color of food.
[47:26.61]Those videos are insane.
[47:28.53]That's like the YouTube children's content.
[47:33.63]And it's weird as hell.
[47:36.63]A lot of these videos, they narrate over themselves talking.
[47:41.29]The characters, the people in the videos don't talk.
[47:45.75]They're narrated over pretending to talk.
[47:49.30]And they all just eat like green foods in like every fucking video.
[47:54.53]It's just, oh, we're only going to eat blue foods today.
[47:57.80]It's every video.
[48:07.27]People think I'm crazy right now.
[48:08.47]Everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[48:09.59]Oh, some of you know what I'm talking about.
[48:12.11]The underworld's power.
[48:21.62]Jesse, what are you talking about?
[48:22.72]Some of you guys know.
[48:23.60]Some of you guys know, like, the red, green, blue thumbnail, and you're just like, oh, it's one of these.
[48:27.84]Yeah, well, how would I know that?
[48:39.72]Because, you know, I gotta assess the competition.
[48:43.08]You know, what are people doing on YouTube now?
[48:44.76]I gotta, like, see what I'm up against.
[48:55.76]That room was pretty good.
[48:58.16]Use your special and look at the damage.
[49:04.97]Same audience.
[49:05.69]No, it's not the same audience.
[49:07.51]You guys aren't six.
[49:12.23]50 damage.
[49:12.65]That wasn't that much.
[49:13.21]40.
[49:14.76]That's pretty good.
[49:17.76]Holy shit, that's really good.
[49:29.13]That's so good.
[49:32.51]I'll tell you, I probably would rather have the controller.
[49:41.09]Or, uh, the... Um... Bow.
[49:45.78]But, it's okay.
[49:49.70]Your special is the volley.
[49:51.00]Oh, so what is this one then?
[49:53.62]What is that?
[49:55.60]Alright, I have not been in the trident room before.
[50:00.42]It's a cast.
[50:11.11]Is aim assist on PC too?
[50:13.55]Well, I'd probably turn it off.
[50:18.81]This move is so good.
[50:20.32]Why even use any other move?
[50:21.24]It's good.
[50:29.11]Then, in the name of Hades... Don't use other moves.
[50:31.74]I accept this message.
[50:35.26]Don't use any moves.
[50:38.88]Ever.
[50:45.12]Oi there, little Hades.
[50:46.92]You recognize your uncle, do you not?
[50:49.13]You have a lot of catching up to do, but first things first.
[50:52.07]You get yourself out of that dour underworld.
[50:54.77]As for me, I'll see if I can Ster things up a bit to cover your advance.
[51:03.70]Hey, it's me.
[51:05.69]Every single god has ever been recorded.
[51:10.13]Nobody knows what the fuck we actually sounded like.
[51:14.57]We actually may have sounded like this.
[51:19.02]Boy there, Hades.
[51:20.24]You recognize your uncle, do you not?
[51:22.26]We've a lot of catching up to do, but first things first.
[51:24.98]You get yourself out of that door, Underworld.
[51:26.58]As for me, I'll see if I can Ster things up a bit to cover your advance.
[51:37.22]Don't forget the echo.
[51:41.02]It's just so simple.
[51:42.82]A big, strong character that has the control of the waves and shit.
[51:46.48]Of course they're going to sound like that.
[51:48.54]But we don't know.
[51:50.56]Ain't a random assortment of jewels?
[52:02.77]Hmm.
[52:04.74]I think I want this.
[52:05.26]Wait, your attack deals more damage and knocks foes away.
[52:07.60]That's good for the bow.
[52:09.55]Your attack and special is stronger the first 10 seconds in an encounter.
[52:13.65]You do 50% more damage for 10 seconds when you go in a room?
[52:17.27]I mean, that's good.
[52:21.19]But I kind of want a random, like, pull the slot machine.
[52:25.36]Holy shit.
[52:27.06]The power of the seas should be of help.
[52:29.90]I got five jewels.
[52:31.60]I got one tonic.
[52:34.48]I got a snack.
[52:35.66]I got another five jewels.
[52:40.19]Okay, there's more currency.
[52:41.05]Alright, I got it.
[52:44.49]Alright, I'm gonna go in the key room because I want a key.
[52:54.14]What are you aiming at, dude?
[52:57.44]What the hell is he doing?
[53:02.13]Whoa!
[53:02.89]Okay, we're good.
[53:06.47]Now you're gonna lose.
[53:07.09]I don't think I'm gonna lose.
[53:14.76]What's the range on this?
[53:15.48]This is a boss.
[53:33.39]That's what it means, right?
[53:33.99]There's a boss there.
[53:35.07]Wait.
[53:35.27]It might be treasures.
[53:48.88]How can I break that?
[53:50.85]Drink out of the cauldron.
[53:52.23]Drink out of the cauldron.
[53:54.49]Drink out of the cauldron?
[53:55.75]Where's the... Drink out of this?
[53:59.42]Let's see what's in here.
[54:01.24]Whoa.
[54:01.54]Gain 29 points for health.
[54:06.12]Oh.
[54:07.28]That's nothing.
[54:08.82]You deal 50% damage striking undamaged foes for six rooms.
[54:16.30]Gain one?
[54:18.62]Okay, so I get an extra special.
[54:21.99]Probably this one.
[54:25.67]Yeah, I'm taking that one for six rooms.
[54:29.28]That's kind of cool.
[54:39.50]Alright, let's go.
[54:41.05]Doomstone?
[54:47.99]Watch it!
[55:02.77]Whoa!
[55:03.07]Give me a way.
[55:08.13]You gotta break these fucking things.
[55:09.11]That's how they bounce.
[55:24.68]Oh, punch him up.
[55:25.90]Punch him up.
[55:40.56]Get out of here.
[55:41.36]Didn't even take one fucking hit.
[55:48.64]I did actually.
[55:49.14]Right here I did.
[55:51.50]Took two damage.
[55:52.16]That's pretty good.
[55:54.12]Wait.
[55:54.42]Gift minus one.
[55:57.67]Why am I going to lose my potion?
[56:00.53]I don't get it.
[56:04.23]Don't give it.
[56:07.77]What does that do?
[56:09.93]You give it to Zeus.
[56:12.23]Okay, but what does it do, though?
[56:13.78]Should I do it and see what happens?
[56:18.90]Don't do it.
[56:19.96]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[56:21.26]It's the dating sim.
[56:22.48]Oh, do I want to date Zeus or do I want to date Poseidon?
[56:27.20]There are more than two characters, okay?
[56:28.98]Like, why am I going, would I rather date Zeus or Poseidon?
[56:34.63]Zeus and Poseidon are both sitting in their living room watching this from the clouds.
[56:38.95]And they're both going, uh, dude, like, what is he talking about?
[56:41.57]Like, he thinks he's gonna just, like, date one of us?
[56:45.11]Is that what he thinks he's doing down here?
[56:48.19]Um... One of us should go down there and tell him.
[56:51.28]I'm gonna save it.
[56:52.44]Holy shit, that's pretty good.
[56:56.34]Alright.
[56:59.38]Do I date Zeus or do I date Poseidon?
[57:00.84]Which one?
[57:02.72]Uh...
[57:06.01]There's lots of single people in the world of Valhalla.
[57:11.65]Some of us have been married for 4,000 years, dude.
[57:14.22]I don't like that.
[57:18.82]I like this one.
[57:25.26]I like this one.
[57:30.24]wrong valhalla whatever you know but it's heaven and what they're all it's just heaven heaven damned lost souls with nowhere left to turn congregate wrong religion it's not a religion with the Earth itself into odious forms which defy description it is no it's not
[57:58.10]What do you think it is?
[57:59.74]It was a thing that they... Were these real people?
[58:03.14]I'm kidding.
[58:08.20]I'm fucking kidding.
[58:09.32]Relax.
[58:13.16]I'm kidding.
[58:13.76]Alright, let me play my game, please, before everybody yells at me.
[58:31.14]I'm liking the lightning.
[58:32.52]I should have dated Zeus.
[58:36.08]Stop saying that!
[58:48.20]The bow is so much fun.
[58:49.91]I've ruined the game for myself.
[59:02.14]Because I'm not... Why would I... Somebody said, oh, get the spear.
[59:04.56]No, why?
[59:05.16]Why would I ever?
[59:05.60]What did I tell you?
[59:08.41]Ooh, shit.
[59:11.25]Too much fun.
[59:11.89]Game ruined.
[59:12.71]Alright, I got four more encounters with 50% more damage to foes.
[59:23.37]Break everything?
[59:25.74]Alright, somebody in chat, please correct me.
[59:27.70]Is this a break everything game?
[59:29.64]Could there be something in there or is this a waste of time?
[59:35.33]No.
[59:35.69]No.
[59:36.11]Not even.
[59:36.43]Okay.
[59:36.87]Maybe eventually.
[59:37.41]Okay.
[59:42.81]Some jars have money.
[59:43.81]Alright.
[59:51.71]Who's that?
[59:56.72]I don't have deflect on my dash anymore.
[60:09.29]Anymore?
[60:09.57]There we go.
[60:21.80]Oh, what am I thinking?
[60:25.52]Turn off auto-aim.
[60:26.28]It sucks.
[60:27.48]Alright, I will.
[60:29.61]I feel like it's helping me a little bit, though.
[60:31.37]I really do.
[60:31.80]Shit.
[60:35.01]Hold on.
[60:52.45]Because see how it's like automatically going right at some people sometimes?
[60:56.19]But other times it doesn't.
[60:59.19]Sucks.
[60:59.45]Turn it off.
[60:59.83]I can't turn it off right now.
[61:08.26]Oh, yeah I can.
[61:08.70]Okay, aim assist.
[61:22.71]Turn it back on.
[61:23.37]Turn it back on.
[61:24.23]Not good.
[61:24.91]It's not good.
[61:25.49]Not good.
[61:25.79]Omeglel, you suck.
[61:30.63]No, it's a controller aim.
[61:32.29]Don't you get it?
[61:33.47]Don't you understand?
[61:34.55]Ooh, what?
[61:38.82]There's a reward in here?
[61:41.02]Oh.
[61:43.70]Plus 12.
[61:46.40]Use a mouse.
[61:47.04]No, but I like moving around.
[61:48.36]That's the worst thing.
[61:50.83]You know what I need?
[61:51.95]This is what I need.
[61:53.05]I seriously need this.
[61:55.25]I'm dead serious about this.
[61:56.35]I'm willing to put forth the effort to make this happen.
[61:59.83]I like to move around in games with the thumb and the controller, and I love the face buttons to do everything.
[62:06.19]I don't like WASD and moving around that way.
[62:09.82]But the mouse is so much better to aim.
[62:13.60]I love the mouse more than I like aiming with an analog, or most people do.
[62:17.30]So here's the solution that I have.
[62:19.32]If I get an eye tracker...
[62:21.99]Can I use my eyes as the mouse and use my controller as the keyboard?
[62:27.10]You know what I'm saying?
[62:30.94]So then I can get best of both worlds.
[62:36.52]So my eyes with an eye tracker actually are the mouse.
[62:43.09]And I can still move around with the thumb pad and use the face buttons.
[62:46.25]That wouldn't work, but it would be so much better.
[62:53.24]What about tunnel vision?
[62:55.18]What's this?
[62:58.10]Trespasser.
[63:00.68]Revive for 45 seconds.
[63:03.85]Okay.
[63:07.29]Oh, that's not good.
[63:21.20]Didn't want to take damage there.
[63:22.32]Stupid.
[63:26.80]Uh-oh, don't get stuck in the corner!
[63:35.65]A few more moments.
[63:38.81]Ow!
[63:42.89]Enough.
[63:46.99]Now to collect.
[63:50.06]What's that?
[63:50.40]Oh, this is Aphrodite.
[63:53.32]Chat, close your eyes.
[64:17.80]Rush shot.
[64:19.32]You cast as a wide, short-range blast that inflicts weak.
[64:24.44]Ooh.
[64:26.02]After you take damage, damage foes around you and inflict weak.
[64:30.30]But weak just makes them deal less damage.
[64:31.88]Okay, that's cool.
[64:33.56]Or any upgrade to your health.
[64:35.66]Rewards are worth more.
[64:36.92]Ooh.
[64:40.77]That's pretty good.
[64:42.31]That's really good.
[64:45.93]want that one and the power to break hearts sure I don't see why not so unfortunately oh I have 320 gold this is actually like somebody has a real a paragraph of information here someone who owns a thrust master
[65:10.02]And has it set up in left-handed mode using a joystick and a mouse at the same time really depends on the game.
[65:14.71]Sometimes games just won't let you use a joystick and keyboard.
[65:16.86]Wait, is that a real thing?
[65:17.80]I feel like this is like a meme and you just talked about like, I just, that's like a zirkin off thing.
[65:30.85]It's called the Thrustmaster?
[65:34.16]It's a stick?
[65:36.00]No, it's not.
[65:36.66]Okay.
[65:38.84]I own a Thrustmaster T16000M.
[65:42.12]And it's in left-handed mode.
[65:46.89]Okay.
[65:49.57]That's what it's called?
[65:50.57]I thought I really didn't want to read the rest of the message.
[65:55.49]It's a flight stick.
[65:57.89]Oh.
[65:58.01]Oh.
[66:01.17]It's real.
[66:01.71]Okay.
[66:02.09]Alright.
[66:03.63]It depends on the game though.
[66:04.87]Okay.
[66:06.95]Well, I got enough money to do... Alright.
[66:09.97]Maybe I should just buy... Wait.
[66:11.53]You have something to say.
[66:12.23]I can give him something?
[66:14.83]Does this reduce the prices or something?
[66:20.47]If I gift him this, will it drop the prices by like 10% or something?

[68:21.58]That's Hercules.
[68:24.02]I was going to say Hercules or Quasimodo.
[68:28.32]Is Quasimodo a Greek god?
[68:34.56]Was he Greek?
[68:38.39]Okay, was he at least a Greek citizen?
[68:45.45]No.
[68:46.73]Was he Roman?
[68:47.39]Was he a Roman citizen?
[68:48.33]He was French.
[68:48.91]He was French.
[68:50.07]Oh, never mind.
[68:55.45]Whatever.
[68:55.79]Okay.

[69:46.59]Used to permanently grow stronger.
[69:50.17]Purchasing items during choice of benefits.
[70:03.03]Okay.
[70:03.81]Stop reading so hard.
[70:09.51]I thought if I pressed this, it was like, oh, your life total is 75 out of 75.
[70:13.52]Lose it all for an express trip back to the House of Hades.
[70:16.52]I'm giving it to you.

[70:30.10]Purchasing items during an attempt.
[70:31.48]All lost on death.
[70:32.37]Alright, so don't I want that?
[70:34.07]But I have upgrades.
[70:36.57]Alright, take this one.
[70:37.97]Give me gold.
[70:39.75]Do you want this?
[70:41.21]Should I give this thing to him?
[70:45.07]There's a shop right here.
[70:45.87]Why are they doing like chat faces?
[70:54.96]Did I just say something that really made a bunch of people uncomfortable?
[71:11.08]You bought something that made us uncomfortable.
[71:12.92]Alright, here we go.
[71:14.62]Take a look at this.
[71:17.14]Bingo.
[71:19.36]This is a boss fight.
[71:20.04]Alright, I'm ready for this one this time.
[71:21.52]Let's see if I can do it.
[71:26.83]Shut the fuck up Oculus commercial.
[71:28.49]I'm trying to watch Jerma.
[71:30.65]Yeah, a lot of those Oculus commercials, they move around.
[71:32.53]You see how they move around those commercials?
[71:33.85]Like super fluid and like tons of movement.
[71:39.54]They should really make a realistic commercial.
[71:42.41]How much more would you think it was interesting for, like, an Oculus if that person was, like, doing the moves and, like, dancing around and stuff and they smashed into their walls and into, like, a shelf and stuff, like, a bunch of times in the commercial?
[71:52.09]That'd be fucking hilarious.
[71:53.03]Alright, I'm ready.
[72:01.28]Alright, I'm gonna beat this lady.
[72:04.94]Hi, Meg.
[72:07.22]Okay, let's go, Meg.
[72:10.40]I had to look over to make sure Family Guy wasn't on this list.
[72:17.26]You really blew it.
[72:18.97]Yeah, shut up, Meg.
[72:20.91]I can do it.
[72:22.37]It's not on that list.
[72:25.63]Alright, I'm ready.
[72:29.11]I'm going to be quiet and I'm going to beat this person.
[72:30.97]Three, two, one, go.
[72:45.54]I don't think so.
[72:46.68]I don't think so.
[72:51.20]Oh!
[73:12.75]Oh come on, where'd you come from?
[73:18.32]What does that mean?
[73:19.20]Fuck!
[73:52.42]Where is she?
[73:53.08]Oh!
[73:56.33]What was that?
[74:01.67]Holy shit!
[74:07.40]I gotta kill these guys.
[74:26.25]What?
[74:33.55]No.
[74:36.15]Got her.
[74:39.14]Fury vanquished.
[74:42.44]Be seeing you around.
[74:44.66]Be seeing you.
[74:47.42]Five subs.
[74:57.32]God damn it.
[75:08.70]Hey up, just keep track.
[75:10.14]Keep track of it.
[75:10.80]I'll fucking do it later.
[75:20.57]What is this?
[75:20.99]Come on, why?
[75:25.10]why heightened blood why no you need to have mods for a chat this big there are mods here
[75:44.97]What is this?
[75:45.55]I'm so pissed off that I did that.
[75:47.57]I'm just a parrot.
[75:49.69]I hear it and it just pops into my head and I have to say it out loud.
[75:53.16]I'm gonna lose every time.
[75:54.98]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[76:07.97]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[76:10.55]You nailed it.
[76:11.41]You absolutely nailed it.
[76:12.95]But no question marks.
[76:14.21]You fucked it up.
[76:15.49]You fucked it up.
[76:16.93]You gotta write... You have to write on there, and it's 1001.
[76:27.39]Perfect.
[76:27.91]Take the question marks off.
[76:29.55]And say, epic, like, epic dad versus mom food eating challenge.
[76:41.49]I gotta tell you this too when they eat the broccoli and the vegetables they puke and stuff the blue what are they teaching our children the blue candy and the red candy is delicious yeah I eat it eat it every day they eat the whole bottle but once it once it gets to the broccoli it's like like what the hell is going on
[77:14.08]I don't understand, like, the primary colors shit.
[77:18.04]Why is every one of these videos blue, green, red, and yellow?
[77:21.69]And they all play the same sound effects, too.
[77:32.07]They play, like, every five seconds.
[77:37.90]It's like mutating our children's brains.
[77:50.71]I love the fact that you've watched them.
[77:54.06]Of course I have.
[78:03.72]It's always primary colors.
[78:05.12]It's always like half the room is like green, half the room is like orange.
[78:11.98]Just sit your kids in front of Sesame Street, please.
[78:15.62]Do not sit them in front of like the bath salt fucking YouTube kids channels.
[78:32.87]Sit them in front of this stream.
[78:34.09]Do not do that either.
[78:36.31]I am worse than the primary color kids channels.
[78:39.13]None other than those in the trusted inner circle of Lord Hades are authorized to enter the intricate chambers connecting the vast regions of the underworld.
[78:48.78]But the prince decides to barge in anyway.
[78:59.15]Make a lot of moolah.
[79:03.36]I have to say this because it's a failed Jerma985 experiment that I was going to do years ago.
[79:08.77]And I told one person about it.
[79:12.27]Years ago, while I was just streaming, I wasn't going to say anything about it.
[79:16.75]I was going to make a kid's YouTube channel and make just awesome, incredibly good, wholesome children's content on YouTube on a new channel.
[79:26.71]And I was going to do it for like a year and I wasn't going to wait until somebody found it.
[79:31.18]I was going to try, you know like the slime joke?
[79:33.32]I'm going to see if I can get slime to be more popular than me.
[79:37.60]My goal was to have like a billion view a day kids YouTube channel.
[79:41.15]That was good shit.
[79:42.43]We're talking like puppets and counting and geography and bringing that back.
[79:47.33]I'm bringing the puppets.
[79:48.31]I want to bring the puppets back.
[79:53.49]There would be only a few cookies eaten every video, right?
[79:57.37]It wouldn't be like squeeze the sugar into your mouth like half of these fucking shows.
[80:01.76]No.
[80:02.66]We would sing songs about like broccoli, but they would be good.
[80:05.64]They would be good fucking songs.
[80:07.00]It wouldn't be shitty.
[80:10.06]I was going to try to be like a billion view a day YouTube kids channel and see if anybody found it.
[80:17.99]You thought Quasimodo was Greek?
[80:20.31]Greek.
[80:22.00]That's why you hire people to be able to... You hire people to come in, like educators.
[80:29.33]You bring in educators.
[80:31.45]Hey, what's a good lesson plan that we could do?
[80:33.69]We could have some fun characters do cool shit, right?
[80:36.55]I want cool shit.
[80:38.06]Bring in a bunch of teachers, guidance counselors, like all of them.
[80:44.68]Sesame Street does that too.
[80:46.00]That's right.
[80:47.18]But I want to do it as well.
[80:54.25]Ooh, wait, what's this?
[80:56.21]Is this free?
[81:03.41]Is this just for free?
[81:06.99]Is this like the bread at Outback Steakhouse?
[81:09.15]Am I gonna get charged for this?
[81:12.09]Okay.
[81:14.27]Good, I don't want to.
[81:16.66]I'm also, by the way, implying that you don't get charged for the bread at Outback Steakhouse.
[81:20.72]Not that you do.
[81:25.54]Sell?
[81:26.42]Sell?
[81:28.83]Ah!
[81:32.29]Ah, I can sell all the things I have on me.
[81:35.59]I don't want to sell.
[81:37.89]How do I go back?
[81:40.21]Shop.
[81:42.39]Ooh, I don't have any money.
[81:46.71]Buy, buy, buy.
[81:47.35]There.
[81:56.60]Ooh.
[81:57.86]Going up the tower.
[82:01.46]That link is a weak choice.
[82:02.60]Oh, this is area two.
[82:03.38]How many areas are in the... Don't tell me.
[82:04.58]I can't believe I did the fucking gnome reference.
[82:11.51]What the hell?
[82:14.31]I was so confident, too.
[82:17.22]I was like, this is so easy to not do.
[82:18.68]I'm going to die to lava 100%.
[82:20.06]Give me a new contract.
[82:20.64]I want a new one.
[82:38.84]If I die to lava, then I get one community sub.
[82:44.66]But if I don't die to lava for the next hour, I shave a hundred million off the debt.
[82:54.37]No deal.
[82:55.01]Okay, fine.
[83:02.29]A hundred subs?
[83:03.25]No way!
[83:10.48]Alright, what is this?
[83:11.51]This is locked.
[83:13.23]Oh, this is a new hub world.
[83:14.47]Here's one of these.
[83:17.65]Oh, there's lava.
[83:20.83]Oh, this guy shoots lava at you.
[83:22.83]Oh, you can't hit him.
[83:25.53]What?
[83:30.22]Slam dancers?
[83:33.68]Not as strong as I was before, that's for sure.
[83:44.59]They slam and they dance.
[83:50.87]Well, that was bad.
[83:57.07]Don't get near me.
[84:00.11]Oh, shit.
[84:00.37]That's... Oh, I see why you can die to lava.
[84:03.19]Okay, you can actually fall in that lava.
[84:09.54]Oh, shit.
[84:09.96]I'm not doing any damage.
[84:12.00]I need a new weapon or something.
[84:26.58]I need like a new weapon.
[84:27.81]I need like a... No, you need a new weapon.
[84:29.89]Not like a new weapon.
[84:32.45]God, you're supposed to be teaching children soon.
[84:34.31]Get your vocabulary higher.
[84:41.84]Ooh, that was 41 bucks.
[84:45.42]Soon.
[84:45.86]Oh, nice.
[84:48.47]Another 100.
[84:53.22]These are open now.
[84:55.00]Alright, do I want the key or do I... Wait, I don't want the key.
[84:58.94]I want the extra goo.
[85:01.79]Oi!
[85:02.95]Why can you fall off like that?
[85:05.87]Um, okay.
[85:17.03]Burn flingers?
[85:18.96]Slam dancers?
[85:21.84]What else we got?
[85:27.23]Finger lickers.
[85:39.30]Don't.
[85:42.20]I gotta go across.
[85:42.74]KFC.
[85:47.34]Oh shit, there's a new enemy.
[85:54.89]What is it?
[86:01.72]Nice.
[86:02.82]Belly itchers.
[86:03.71]Do I want the shop?
[86:09.21]I don't think I have enough money for anything, do I?
[86:10.95]I guess I kind of do.
[86:11.61]These are hobbit last names.
[86:22.56]Sort of.
[86:22.84]Alright, do I want Poseidon or do I want power-up?
[86:29.11]The searing flame and ashes of the river Phlegathon mean nothing to the ferryman Charon, who travels all the waters of the underworld.
[86:36.87]You want the fruit.
[86:38.23]You want Poseidon.
[86:39.45]And all their fineries.
[86:41.85]You want Uncle.
[86:44.29]I do enjoy dead people's fineries.
[86:46.14]Sure, I'll take the Uncle power-up.
[86:49.40]Don't spend it all in one place.
[86:51.20]Ah, you found me, little nephew.
[86:52.82]Huh?
[86:53.16]Strewn among the inventories of that most disturbing river boatman.
[86:58.01]Oh!
[87:06.19]Wait.
[87:09.51]Why would I... No, give me this!
[87:13.81]Yes!
[87:16.29]I got another gift, too.
[87:17.25]I have two gifts, and I have a ton of that currency.
[87:22.81]And I'm gonna get even more of that currency.
[87:25.13]Let's go.
[87:25.98]Hundred currency now.
[87:28.29]And I can buy the power up too.
[87:35.50]I kind of have to do that.
[87:43.76]121 damage every time they attack.
[87:46.93]I have two.
[87:47.31]I can give it the gift now.
[87:49.09]I'm going to see what it does.
[87:51.89]Here, take it.
[87:53.69]What does it do?
[87:54.55]I have another one.
[87:55.59]Ooh, wait, a gift.
[87:55.91]Plus one health.
[87:56.47]That's worthless.
[87:57.01]One health?
[88:32.90]It's a keepsake.
[88:33.94]Oh.
[88:37.86]Keepsake's not going to keep me alive.
[88:39.54]It was a bone hourglass.
[88:42.67]What the fuck?
[88:43.51]I'm so stupid.
[88:44.29]I was looking at chat.
[88:46.07]Can I see?
[88:46.67]Oh, it's an... Okay, let's go.
[88:52.43]You ungrateful, ungrateful little shit.
[89:00.38]Alright, come on, jolt him.
[89:03.55]That, I didn't know exploded.
[89:10.65]You ult him.
[89:19.38]Nice.
[89:31.79]God damn it.
[89:32.37]I don't like the lava place.
[89:33.23]It's too hard to die.
[89:33.93]It's too easy to die.
[89:38.61]Get away from me.
[89:48.52]Get away from me.
[89:52.16]Asphodel is easy to die in.
[89:55.60]Yeah.
[89:57.59]Oh, we're up to heat.
[89:59.87]Oh, jolt.
[90:01.31]Jolt, jolt, jolt, jolt.
[90:05.71]Jolt build.
[90:08.03]We're doing a jolt build.
[90:09.47]Jolt build, jolt build.
[90:13.72]Ooh.
[90:16.12]Okay, instant restore.
[90:17.26]36 health.
[90:17.72]I think I'm going to get that.
[90:20.69]You deal 50% damage to armor.
[90:22.70]Pretty good.
[90:24.94]Your special deals 40% more damage.
[90:27.82]I don't even use the special.
[90:28.76]I feel like it sucks.
[90:30.42]I'm taking the help.
[90:32.86]I'll take this one.
[90:33.48]Special is good.
[90:39.73]Any build you make is a joke build.
[90:41.89]Oh, I'm in... I'm in Asophadil, so... Got me this far.
[90:50.47]Specialist Y. Okay, so what is B?
[90:53.77]What is that gem?
[90:55.01]The weird, like, gem that I throw out?
[90:58.22]What is the, uh, the your sim has zero in every category icon?
[91:02.86]What does it do?
[91:04.50]It just gets cast.
[91:05.82]Okay.
[91:09.87]Oh, that's actually really great then.
[91:14.89]Use it.
[91:16.24]Yeah, see, but it... Okay.
[91:18.30]It just shoots out this little blob that does 50 damage.
[91:21.51]And it takes a... You have to aim it.
[91:26.73]I gotta pee.
[91:30.15]You need an augment.
[91:31.11]You have to upgrade it.
[91:31.87]Okay.
[91:39.43]I can't... Oh, shit.
[91:40.61]Okay, I can't destroy those.
[91:45.64]Get away from me.
[91:46.90]Get away from me!
[91:50.45]Thank God I didn't just say the thing I was gonna say.
[92:19.99]Watch it.
[92:20.65]Watch out.
[92:25.54]I need to slow.
[92:27.24]I need to shut up.
[92:28.62]It's not that big of a deal.
[92:29.74]You touched the lava once.
[92:30.80]Cool.
[92:47.63]Come on, Zeus.
[92:50.58]This one's rare.
[92:52.58]Finally, I have a new cast.
[92:54.56]Your cast is a chain lightning.
[92:58.26]After you take damage, your foe is struck by lightning.
[93:00.58]Ugh.
[93:03.00]Your dash causes a lightning bolt.
[93:05.02]This is good, too.
[93:07.10]But again, I actually get a cast.
[93:14.11]Yeah, give me a cast.
[93:14.79]Let me see what the hell it even does.
[93:18.09]Yeah, alright, cool.
[93:19.07]I actually have a move now.
[93:29.74]Shit, you gotta get it to hit prog.
[93:33.56]Oh, proc.
[93:35.16]Eh, I mean, it's not that great.
[93:41.24]I do that much damage by just shooting somebody once.
[93:53.75]Anybody else feel like he's saying things that I say, but way more collected, way more cool?
[94:02.77]Really?
[94:03.07]You wanna go?
[94:12.18]He's just way more interesting.
[94:13.20]He's way more soft-spoken than I am.
[94:18.11]I actually get hit by that.
[94:18.95]He's hotter than you.
[94:22.27]Okay.
[94:25.25]Oh, no.
[94:25.71]What do I do?
[94:29.03]This guy's hotter than me.
[94:46.31]I have so much of this currency.
[94:47.42]I'm going to be a level up.
[94:49.06]Ten times.
[94:57.84]Wait.
[94:58.83]What else is there?
[95:00.25]Ooh, alright.
[95:00.67]Do I want... No, I don't have enough money.
[95:02.35]Let's get the pomegranate.
[95:16.69]Okay, I have a feeling I'm probably not going to beat the boss because I'm feeling like I'm not doing as much damage as I should be.
[95:22.03]Why does this look so easy to take this?
[95:23.81]Click the link.
[95:25.97]Alright, I'm clicking it.
[95:27.05]Uh...
[95:46.92]This is Hades.
[95:49.34]Not Hades.
[96:00.32]Wrong link.
[96:01.10]How?
[96:01.20]That's the one being spammed.
[96:19.47]to get this one out.
[96:27.26]Ancient tablet.
[96:28.84]I love how CNN politics is still a thing.
[96:32.88]A thousand years from now, apparently.
[96:34.44]I have to do it.
[96:36.40]I don't even care what the other ones are.
[96:41.48]I want to get this to 200 damage.
[96:53.84]Doesn't get it.
[96:56.00]No, wait, so that's not supposed to be, like, I... That's lore about me, like, a thousand years in the future?
[97:00.79]Like, that's been buried?
[97:01.61]That's, like, an old tablet of, like, the Great Ascening?
[97:04.61]Great, like, ass-revealing?
[97:15.93]Great Ascending.
[97:17.19]The Great Ascending.
[97:19.69]Uh, this is a new room.
[97:20.43]It's a boss, too.
[97:21.05]Alright, I gotta... I gotta wipe my hands.
[97:24.18]Chat doesn't get it.
[97:24.94]Well, I mean, yeah, I get it.
[97:27.02]I get it.
[97:27.90]I get it.
[97:31.42]You're thinking too hard.
[97:33.10]Sorry.
[97:34.34]Alright, here we go.
[97:35.06]It's a snake.
[97:42.38]Let's take a look.
[97:42.99]Hold on.
[97:43.69]Let's just see what he does first.
[97:46.53]Alright, he shoots things.
[97:48.07]I'm going to use this to block.
[97:49.45]Can I dash through them?
[97:50.29]I can.
[97:51.95]It's not that big of a deal.
[97:52.87]Just relax.
[97:56.08]Plus we have like thorns on him.
[98:13.49]I gotta keep this on him because he'll hurt himself every time.
[98:16.88]This guy's a joke.
[98:27.61]Oh, phase two?
[98:28.39]Oh, well, never mind.
[98:29.95]I spoke too soon.
[98:34.07]Just dodge and jolt.

[99:27.08]Whoa, that's different.

[101:48.42]Hold on.
[101:51.50]RT game crowd with the monster raid.
[101:56.29]What's going on guys?
[101:57.05]Welcome.
[101:58.97]Hope you had a good stream.
[102:00.53]Oh, what was he doing today?
[102:05.27]The game's too easy.
[102:07.00]That took a lot of guts.
[102:09.94]Planet Coaster?
[102:11.26]Oh, cool.
[102:12.08]Is that game good still?
[102:13.28]Did they update it at all?
[102:14.14]Is it, like, fun?
[102:14.72]I remember I tried to get a gorilla to, like, punch people in the face and, like, climb out of the enclosure and kill people.
[102:25.35]Has it gone any different from there?
[102:26.53]I've played it one time for, like, four hours.
[102:36.18]But welcome, guys.
[102:36.72]They're playing Hades.
[102:37.80]First time playing ever.
[102:39.54]First trying the second boss, which everyone told me.
[102:42.50]Guaranteed he dies on the second boss.
[102:45.96]Sometimes you have to show them what you're capable of.
[102:52.30]Sing the raid song.
[102:58.95]They're leaving because you're not singing the raid song.
[103:01.15]No.
[103:01.61]They're sticking around until at least an hour from now.
[103:07.88]I can heal.
[103:09.08]I kind of- is it weird that I want to die?
[103:12.32]So I can spend some of this currency?
[103:15.76]Sing or we're gonna leave.
[103:20.59]Thank you for the raid!
[103:26.79]There.
[103:27.91]That probably hurts.
[103:29.03]I'm sorry, I was doing that way too close to the microphone.
[103:33.00]This is what happens when you make me sing and make me do this.
[103:36.04]Don't tell me to do that anymore.
[103:38.44]Don't tell me to do that anymore.
[103:39.92]That was pretty fun to say.
[103:43.12]He's clapping his ass.
[103:44.36]Just shaking really hard.
[103:47.85]Alright, 20.
[103:48.39]Yeah, give me that.
[103:48.97]Oops.
[103:55.15]Oh, yeah, I get that.

[104:12.85]Come on.
[104:17.63]Beatbox the Pepsi Man song.
[104:22.83]I don't even know what that is.
[104:28.27]The fields of Elysium.
[104:32.00]I got an achievement that just says, I thought it said escape, asshole.
[104:35.82]It's you escaped Assafil.
[104:37.48]I kind of want to die.
[104:41.16]You escaped Assafil.
[104:41.72]How would you spell that?
[104:42.68]Assafil.
[105:02.85]Uh... Which one of these do I want?
[105:10.02]Probably the pomegranate.
[105:12.68]That's jolt though, right?
[105:14.56]Jolt is pomegranate plus.
[105:25.78]Oh, I can't... Wait, you didn't hurt him?
[105:36.68]That just bounced around like, wow, that hurt.
[105:42.36]Is that egg shooting me?
[105:44.60]It is.
[105:50.39]Kill this thing.
[105:50.93]Can't.
[105:54.83]Why would I get close to a guy with a sword?
[105:56.07]That's what I want to know.
[106:01.55]Do you have to kill them before they go back to this sword?
[106:10.92]Oh, I just walked right into that.
[106:13.02]I'm okay.
[106:18.80]Oh my fucking god.
[106:19.70]I hate these things.
[106:20.72]Stupid.
[106:21.00]I hate them.
[106:24.60]I want to die anyways.
[106:25.45]I seriously do.
[106:25.99]I have like a fucking hundred.
[106:27.59]I have like 200 gems to spend.
[106:37.99]Delicious.
[106:41.84]He's throwing now.
[106:42.80]No, I'm not.
[106:43.36]I'm not.
[106:44.88]I have jolt six.
[106:46.62]I can't throw.
[106:52.46]Definitely the health.
[106:58.40]Is diminishing returns?
[107:01.65]Long spears.
[107:09.47]Are you guys doing anything?
[107:13.79]Alright, that was free, I guess.
[107:19.93]Am I stunning him somehow?
[107:29.52]I'm stunlocking.
[107:30.40]Oh, that's cool.
[107:35.64]What are these bugs?
[107:43.94]Can these hurt me?
[107:44.66]I feel like these things can hurt you.
[107:48.08]Yeah, they can.
[107:48.54]Of course they can.
[107:58.62]Ow.

[108:26.99]Probably Poseidon.
[108:35.27]Great shields.
[108:37.44]You got to hit him from behind.
[108:42.09]Don't worry, I got jolt on him.
[108:44.41]Yeah, who cares?
[108:45.57]Just jolt him.

[111:21.67]This is not your place.
[111:25.25]Agreed on both counts.
[111:26.83]Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me.
[111:30.84]I will not.
[111:31.46]The champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest.
[111:36.42]Neither will I. I don't know why I think that's funny.
[111:39.16]Wait, you're not the champion of Elysium.
[111:41.68]You're the bull of Minos.
[111:43.02]I can't imagine who's even stronger than you.
[111:45.18]Is it Heracles?
[111:46.02]Tell me it's Heracles.
[111:48.03]Did you say Hercules wrong?
[111:50.04]Come get destroyed.
[111:52.70]Alright, let's go.
[111:53.46]Let me see what he does first.

[112:18.87]Alright, that's what I do.
[112:39.56]Holy shit, he's got a three combo?
[112:45.40]Where is he?
[112:49.22]I'm good.
[113:03.65]I'm sorry.
[113:07.31]I'm sorry.
[113:07.91]What do you want me to say?
[113:08.67]It's stressful.
[113:21.00]How would you go the wrong fucking way?
[113:23.22]I'm sorry, I have to mute.
[113:25.72]I have to mute, I'm not gonna stop doing that.
[113:37.65]What the fuck?
[113:40.13]What the fuck?
[113:40.71]It's me, Grandpa.
[113:42.91]I come out under extreme stressful scenarios.
[113:46.33]Kinda like some of your favorite TV shows and movies.
[113:50.51]You know when the main character has like something else going on where like he turns into another person when he's under a lot of stress like Lucario?
[113:57.09]That's me!
[114:05.35]What?
[114:08.09]I- What?
[114:08.65]He taunted.
[114:09.51]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[114:10.59]He taunted me.
[114:12.29]And he had like a shield on him.
[114:13.31]I thought he was gonna summon enemies.
[114:16.91]I thought he was going to be like, fight my minions.
[114:18.61]I don't know.
[114:20.37]Whatever.
[114:20.69]I wanted to die anyways.
[114:21.37]I got 140 gold.
[114:21.69]Dead.
[114:21.79]I got to pee and I'm going to get some coffee.
[114:44.76]He just jumps and swings?
[114:46.55]I had it down for a little while.
[114:49.29]But when he did the shielded taunt, I thought something else was going to happen.
[115:04.91]Do not question my power, Hades.
[115:07.97]Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface.
[115:12.69]The Olympians are pleased to know they have a distant relative and bid him welcome to their mountain.
[115:18.19]That is all.
[115:19.25]Their influence is very limited.
[115:21.02]I feel like that's too easy, though.
[115:25.46]Do not speak to me about their influence.
[115:28.66]I've seen their influence firsthand.
[115:32.02]You've made a foolish mistake.
[115:33.84]Give it a skelly.
[115:34.46]Now think about this.
[115:36.44]What the hell is this?
[115:36.94]I gotta let me pee.
[115:37.86]I'll be right back.
[120:52.86]Hey.
[120:54.19]Uh, sorry.
[120:54.95]I did the thing where you fill your cup with ice.
[121:00.75]And the ice comes out way too fast.
[121:03.61]And four or five ice cubes just blow out all over you and go underneath the fridge.
[121:08.71]And you're just like, I don't want like five ice cubes under the fridge.
[121:13.46]So I went under there with like a straw and I was trying to get them all out.
[121:22.18]I got them.
[121:32.20]He's rich.
[121:32.80]He's got a rich fridge.
[121:34.08]What are you talking about?
[121:37.08]Isn't every refrigerator made after like 1995 have an ice maker in it?
[121:47.53]Wait, what?
[121:52.79]It's just a regular fridge that has ice in it.
[122:02.27]I don't have a smart fridge.
[122:03.33]I don't want that thing listening to me.
[122:04.47]You know how many weird noises I make in the morning when I open the fridge?
[122:14.08]I open the door and my stomach and my body just make sounds.
[122:17.16]Just like... I don't want like fucking Amazon to hear that.
[122:29.60]Let's pet.
[122:30.72]I can- I don't want- no.
[122:32.06]I feel like everybody does this.
[122:33.24]I want to give it to somebody else.
[122:40.05]You just told them through Twitch.
[122:42.13]Yes, that's true.
[122:44.07]That is true.
[122:46.16]Can I give it to Hades?
[122:48.36]No.
[122:49.12]What is this?
[122:49.52]Renovate.
[122:49.92]What?
[122:57.46]Wait, I can upgrade the... the hall?
[122:59.98]Grand opening deal.
[123:03.24]The house contractor is offering this particular renovation for free.

[124:24.23]Do the quest list.
[124:31.51]Yes, you cannot do without it.
[124:32.95]Weird, but cool.
[124:33.87]No, get the list.
[124:37.19]Isn't this the fated list of minor prophecies?
[124:42.80]Okay, so I have ten more.
[124:51.99]What about this one?
[124:53.89]So this is what you were talking about when you said, not now, but later there'll be treasure chests.
[125:01.26]Switch keepsakes between underworld regions.
[125:06.78]Not worth it yet.
[125:07.46]Okay, so I'll do this one.

[125:49.15]I eventually managed to get home the painful way after all.
[125:52.31]Over half of the game's upgrade require pool.
[125:55.01]Scrying.
[125:56.55]Look, I have a reputation to uphold.
[125:59.01]If you get past me again like that, you best go all the way.

[126:41.07]See you later, sis.
[126:43.77]Oh, there's another way out.
[126:45.99]Sorry, chat.
[126:47.11]I can't believe it.
[126:47.63]He's such an idiot.
[126:48.33]He missed.

[127:15.36]The son of the god of the dead shall someday... Okay, so wait.
[127:19.76]I need to meet... The other gods.
[127:24.70]I need... I got 10 keys.
[127:25.81]Alright, this is just meeting other characters.
[127:31.95]This is unlocking moves and using them.
[127:37.77]This is unlocking all the weapons.
[127:40.70]Okay.
[127:45.12]Just play the game.
[127:47.82]Alright, just play the game and eventually you'll get stuff.
[127:49.76]Get it.
[127:50.20]Got it.
[127:53.22]Here we go.
[128:00.17]Alright.
[128:01.41]I got a lot of money.
[128:03.67]Perform one additional dash in quick succession.
[128:05.87]That's incredible.
[128:08.15]That's just bang bang.
[128:17.56]And this is just more damage when striking from behind.
[128:25.80]That's huge.
[128:27.42]Okay.
[128:28.06]I'm going to do this.
[128:30.36]Should I do this though?
[128:31.56]I can do that.
[128:31.98]How many times can I do this?
[128:32.78]Okay.
[128:35.12]If it was like five, that'd be really good.
[128:38.93]Alright, I'm doing it.
[128:39.55]I'm doing three.
[128:40.01]I get three health every room.
[128:41.33]And I have enough to do this once.
[128:42.87]So there you go.
[128:43.47]I have 20% more damage from behind.
[128:44.81]And I heal three health every time I go in a new room.
[128:46.90]And I can dash twice.
[128:51.89]That changes everything.
[128:52.81]This actually changes everything.
[129:03.57]Alright, Skelly.
[129:04.53]Let's talk.
[129:04.77]Yeah, I kind of want to gift this guy.
[129:07.25]I like his artwork.
[129:07.75]How am I supposed to keep track of which weapons I've earned these with then?
[129:31.91]It's just how I feel like when I take the VR helmet off.
[129:34.25]Alright, I'm going to give you a gift, Skelly.
[129:36.19]Take it.
[129:36.47]What is it?
[130:00.93]Plus one.
[130:02.51]Lucky tooth.
[130:05.78]Check the display case.
[130:09.18]Oh!
[130:13.82]Items from the Well of Charon have durations increased by plus four encounters.
[130:20.58]What's a Well of Charon?
[130:22.48]Oh, that's the shop.
[130:27.01]Instead of six, it's ten.
[130:30.21]Automatically restore up to 50 health when your life total is depleted.
[130:36.73]What?
[130:39.49]Wait, don't I... I want that.
[130:43.31]I can only have one, right?
[130:47.44]Don't I already have one?
[130:50.06]So that means I can die twice.
[130:51.18]I have two extra lives.
[130:57.32]Why would I ever take this off for any reason?
[130:59.75]Alright, you know what?
[131:00.63]Let's go back to sword.
[131:01.71]Let's try it, you know?
[131:02.69]Let's do it.
[131:03.53]You can charge it too, right?
[131:14.28]The spear sucks.
[131:21.16]I don't even have enough keys.
[131:22.00]Alright, this is going to be a key run.
[131:25.96]Thanks for the extra life.
[131:29.45]I want keys because I want whatever these are.
[131:33.85]Key run.
[131:43.97]That was not of reference.
[131:44.98]Just because there are keys in other video games.
[131:52.54]Die Dallas.
[131:53.76]It's the Die Dallas encounter hammer.
[132:02.66]Okay.
[132:04.12]Your special hits a wider area and deals more damage.
[132:07.95]That's... I like that.
[132:10.09]Your attack fire is a wave that pierces foes.
[132:12.09]Okay, so it's like Link at full health.
[132:15.49]I like that.
[132:15.93]Holy shit.
[132:19.68]Um... Why would I... That's 200% more damage.
[132:23.66]And more... Alright, so this is... This is a key and lunge at people run.
[132:29.72]Okay.
[132:33.16]I was only doing 30 damage.
[132:39.70]Wait, I guess 200% of 15 is not that big of a deal.
[132:44.36]Wrong move?
[132:45.02]Isn't that, that's not thrust?
[132:47.61]Now that's thrust.
[132:50.83]Thrust is the third hit.
[132:51.81]Okay.
[132:53.22]Such innumerable, ever-shifting, interlocking chambers.
[132:57.80]The underworld of Lord Hades all but guarantees the dead shall there remain.
[133:04.10]Good thing I'm not dead.
[133:05.20]This game's really good.
[133:06.79]Alright, I understand why.
[133:08.31]I'm like a bandwagon streamer.
[133:10.69]Got nominated for Game of the Year and all of a sudden, yeah, me too, I'm gonna play it!
[133:14.73]It's very good.
[133:15.39]It's very, very good.
[133:17.21]So far, hold on.
[133:18.07]We have a scale here.
[133:20.81]We have a, like, stock market line.
[133:24.49]Right now, I would say, this is... This is like an 89 right now.
[133:31.06]It's right there.
[133:32.74]It's still going up.
[133:34.22]We'll see.
[133:34.60]That does so much more damage.
[133:44.03]If you hit people from behind, too... Oh, yeah.
[133:51.07]Now there's no reason to sell yet.
[133:52.49]What do you mean sell?
[133:53.35]There's no reason to do that.
[134:04.29]I'm treating this like a bow and I can't.
[134:05.51]Here we go.
[134:15.34]Quick, buy, buy.
[134:16.26]You know what?
[134:17.92]Alright.
[134:19.76]Ah, extra health or the mirror.
[134:29.32]I like health though.
[134:34.62]Oh, I'm drinking coffee.
[134:36.09]New enemy.
[134:37.49]What do they do?
[134:40.45]Alright.
[134:42.59]That's very slow.
[134:43.31]I got it.
[134:51.36]Very slow.
[134:51.84]It's dodgeable.
[134:52.40]Very dodgeable.
[134:55.81]Was that 270 damage?
[134:56.51]That was a shitload.
[134:57.27]Oh, it's Bacchus.
[135:20.30]Alright, this is the person that I want to give all the gifts to.
[135:22.84]Your attack inflicts hangover.
[135:23.96]Hangover damage.
[135:24.48]Four every half second.
[135:25.50]Nice.
[135:25.80]Your special inflicts hangover.
[135:27.26]Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog.
[135:50.98]This is a stun.
[135:54.66]I kind of just want the hangover damage.
[135:58.80]Or this one.
[136:00.88]That's five.
[136:01.36]How long does it last?
[136:02.66]Oh, four seconds.
[136:04.76]So that's five, ten, fifteen.
[136:06.30]That's twenty extra damage in two seconds.
[136:12.70]Hmm.
[136:16.12]Leave it to the God of Wine to liven things up around here.
[136:21.77]I like to get the big groups.
[136:26.82]You got the worst one, Omegalull.
[136:28.92]Worst one for you, not for me.
[136:31.92]Worst one, best one for me.
[136:33.46]You suck.
[136:34.08]They give you three options.
[136:36.19]None of them are correct.
[136:37.23]It's how you want to build your character.
[136:39.31]Oh, look it.
[136:41.59]I wouldn't have killed that guy if I didn't have this one selected, would I?
[136:57.74]I'm so glad there's no mana or anything in this game.
[137:07.32]Ooh, that's good.
[137:09.28]The sword's good, too.
[137:17.11]What?
[137:22.99]What reference?
[137:25.75]Mana?
[137:26.05]Oh, he says mana?
[137:27.13]Oh.
[137:27.85]Okay.
[137:31.01]Mana.
[137:38.20]Oh, I thought that was beetle.
[137:43.32]I love the sound.
[137:43.94]Can I?
[137:46.91]Pests.
[137:47.27]Are they called pests?
[137:58.20]Don't let him do that.
[138:03.71]Wow.
[138:04.67]Oh, wow.
[138:05.51]I just almost got shocked by that.
[138:07.53]I almost got killed by that.
[138:08.61]Wow.
[138:09.03]That was close.
[138:11.63]Yes.
[138:22.58]Wow.
[138:23.04]I almost got murdered there.
[138:26.05]Boss and more gems It's not a reference.
[138:29.29]We're talking about I didn't know it's not how is me saying wow I almost got killed.
[138:33.91]How's that a reference?
[138:36.17]I'm gonna get a gift oh Shit alright here we go Good it works out pretty well
[139:00.52]I love- I love dots.
[139:04.76]Damage over time?
[139:05.48]That's not a reference to any particular video game.
[139:10.13]It's not a- That's a Dungeons & Dragons reference.
[139:15.17]Alright, you're making me get hit.
[139:16.03]Stop.
[139:18.12]Bottle of nectar.
[139:27.06]Ooh.
[139:29.38]Passive traps deal 500% damage.
[139:35.44]That's ridiculous.
[139:38.36]I'll take the health.
[139:43.48]Aphrodite or the shop?
[139:44.36]Aphrodite.
[139:54.41]Watch out.
[139:57.20]Take it slow.
[139:57.84]You don't have to go fast.
[139:58.66]What's the point?
[139:59.18]Why do you have to go fast?
[140:00.10]You don't have to.
[140:00.74]Nice.
[140:18.47]Oh, it's Aphrodite.
[140:21.74]Poison stacks.
[140:22.32]Oh, well.
[140:22.52]Way better now that I know that.
[140:23.68]Okay.
[140:23.78]Your cast is a wide short range blast.
[140:25.94]That's probably what I'm going to take.
[140:27.54]Ooh.
[140:27.64]Ooh.
[140:48.39]10% damage across the board reduced.
[140:51.33]Is that better than having a cast that does 100 damage?
[140:55.69]Hey, but if I hit them with the cast, they do 30% less damage anyways.
[141:01.80]So this is 10% without doing anything.
[141:03.66]This is 30% and 100 damage.
[141:07.72]Ooh.
[141:11.08]Really short range.
[141:12.77]Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[141:15.23]It's okay.
[141:16.47]Look, here's what I can do.
[141:17.11]I can... I can go bang, bang.
[141:19.84]Get in there.
[141:20.36]Blast.
[141:20.82]Get out.
[141:21.80]And just watch the dots.
[141:29.92]It stacks.
[141:41.05]It stacks.
[141:42.15]It stacks.
[141:44.80]Ooh!
[141:45.94]That hurt.
[142:04.61]Oh, shit.
[142:05.09]They're getting... Okay, I gotta get... I gotta get in there and get rid of these.
[142:08.93]Too many.
[142:10.67]Too many.
[142:11.01]Way too many over here.
[142:22.90]That's a lot of greed, but it's worth it.
[142:24.20]Alright, we're fine.
[142:26.32]Zeus.
[142:26.42]Lightning.
[142:26.62]Alright.
[142:26.90]Your attack emits chain lightning when you damage, right?
[142:32.34]I really like that.
[142:33.28]But...
[142:52.05]I feel like that's not as good when you don't have a bow.
[143:00.45]Still one.
[143:01.55]It's still better.
[143:19.54]Chain landing is a shaman spell.
[143:24.00]Yes.
[143:25.28]Sure, but that's not... I didn't reference that.
[143:27.36]Holy shit, this is really good.
[143:40.59]Jesus, there's so many of these.
[143:48.19]Alright, well, I'm taking too much damage here.
[143:49.63]Those dicks are just everywhere.
[144:08.10]I won't get stabbed.
[144:09.02]Alright, we're good.
[144:14.40]Dicks every... Dicks every... Keyrun.
[144:18.21]Dicks everywhere.
[144:19.45]I meant like these guys are dicks.
[144:28.97]Just spawn camp.
[144:36.12]Spawn camp.
[144:43.62]I don't let you- Oh, these guys are gonna blow up.
[144:46.67]Wow.
[144:49.07]Too far away.
[144:58.94]Just take them down.
[144:59.86]Just take them down.
[145:02.60]I can use this to unlock a weapon.
[145:09.20]Take them down.
[145:12.06]Look who.
[145:19.91]You just gotta get in there, man.
[145:21.45]Don't be so shy and just go.
[145:23.85]Don't be such a coward.
[145:35.50]You just gotta get in.
[145:36.88]Just go.
[145:39.04]Just be good and just spawn camp, right?
[145:40.60]Wherever they spawn, just get in there.
[145:56.96]Stun him.
[145:57.72]Watch it.
[146:00.74]I want that.
[146:02.64]You.
[146:03.14]Dead.
[146:04.68]One word.
[146:05.22]Take one word every minute.
[146:09.94]All stalling.
[146:10.44]Capable of doing.
[146:13.75]Coin for Charon.
[146:16.91]Drop here.
[146:18.11]Alright, what is this?
[146:19.69]29 health.
[146:21.53]We got a new link.
[146:22.61]Are you going to apologize for that aye-aye-aye thing?
[146:34.81]I don't get this, but maybe some of you do.
[146:37.91]I don't get it.
[146:47.52]I don't get it.
[146:48.08]But thanks, though.
[146:56.41]This is the one you wanted.
[147:03.40]Okay.
[147:04.74]Also, no.
[147:14.83]What?
[147:15.33]Is it this one?
[147:25.15]What is this?
[147:25.65]Okay.
[147:27.13]Suspect wanted 411, 216 pounds.
[147:29.39]That's way smaller and way fatter than I am.
[147:32.23]Bald with a beard.
[147:33.01]Finished Bugsnax on stream.
[147:34.38]I love that's a bullet point.
[147:37.34]We just want to make sure everyone knows he finished Bugsnax on stream.
[147:45.30]That's some major monumentally important piece of data.
[147:52.12]Nemesis crest.
[147:57.03]I want it for that.
[147:57.49]I want to save it Read the ticker Tremor Jerma985 has accumulated two point four nine billion dollars plus, right?
[148:11.37]We can go key run That armor
[148:30.30]What the hell are you hitting me with?
[148:31.36]What?
[148:32.36]Oh, I was so clean too.
[148:33.46]Alright, I gotta move around.
[148:37.81]Too many- Oh my god, I'm getting destroyed in here.
[148:45.15]Holy shit, this room sucks.
[148:52.63]This room was horrible.
[148:54.58]There's traps everywhere and there's projectiles in every corner.
[149:03.98]Shit.
[149:05.22]That's too much damage.
[149:06.22]Alright, not gonna get hit for a while.
[149:15.95]Uh, shop.
[149:24.41]I have four keys and extra super health.
[149:28.96]What do you want?
[149:29.36]Please stop hitting me over the head with the broom.
[149:31.70]What?
[149:32.24]Oh, wait.
[149:32.44]Oh, this is boss time.
[149:33.12]I gotta get this ready.
[149:34.04]This is the first boss.
[149:34.66]It's not a problem.
[149:35.27]Let's go.
[149:56.53]Cyberpunk is out?
[149:57.55]I didn't even know it came out.
[150:00.28]Is it out?
[150:00.78]Oh my god.
[150:02.10]No 3080, no PS5, no Cyberpunk.
[150:04.16]Let's kick this lady's ass.
[150:26.09]Holy shit, I just ate that.
[150:27.07]I haven't played with a sword the whole time.
[150:35.62]Been a while since I've played with anything besides a sword.
[151:01.26]Die!
[151:01.48]Alright, here we go.
[151:04.14]This is the weird part.
[151:18.25]Alright, get her, get her, get her, get her!
[151:22.57]Oh, shit!
[151:23.05]What am I doing?
[151:37.99]I'm not a sword user, it's very evident.
[151:52.76]Watch out!
[151:59.02]Fuck you, you just spawned on me!
[152:07.03]Oh my god, I'm not a sword user.
[152:08.59]I'm not a sword user.
[152:09.61]That's very clear.
[152:11.21]I'm terrible with melee.
[152:18.18]This lady was a cakewalk with the bow.
[152:39.72]I'll still do it, but holy shit, that was painful.
[152:56.88]Remember, just do coke.
[153:00.00]Oh, uh, no.
[153:03.88]That's it.
[153:23.71]No you don't!
[153:28.73]Okay, that was way harder with melee.
[153:45.48]I'm a bow guy.
[153:46.68]Got you.
[153:48.42]The ancient blood.
[153:51.08]This holds some sort of power, but for what?
[153:55.81]I always use the bows in games.
[154:01.01]Melee is for suckers.
[154:02.69]Imagine being able to hurt things from 500 feet away.
[154:06.27]Rather than walk one feet away and try to hurt somebody.
[154:08.91]I mean, come on.
[154:11.65]Why would you ever use anything else?
[154:12.71]Because of honor.
[154:25.13]You know what's really, really honorable and really hard to do is to shoot somebody with a bow from a half mile away.
[154:33.06]That's not honorable at all.
[154:34.10]That's... Is it?
[154:35.56]What is honor?
[154:40.17]That's incredibly dishonorable.
[154:46.55]Shooting somebody from a half a mile away versus facing them one-on-one.
[154:50.61]I think that's the definition of dishonor.
[154:56.32]Can I read this thing?
[155:00.43]Play Dishonored on stream.
[155:14.17]Oh, I already did.
[155:15.43]Didn't I play Dishonored?
[155:18.16]Either in a YouTube video or... I already did it.
[155:19.94]Try the shield.
[155:20.32]Yeah, this is a key run.
[155:22.26]I want to unlock the other weapons.
[155:35.78]Wait, hold on, somebody has something important.
[155:37.16]Jerma, please read.
[155:38.50]You chose dogshit boons.
[155:40.38]Zeus boons are great for synergies with cast and dash.
[155:43.19]Aphrodite and Ares are great attack boons, and Dionysus has an insane cast boon.
[155:48.55]You'll learn more synergies, but please stop talking, taking shit boons.
[155:52.27]Dash modifiers are actually really good, especially Zeus.
[155:55.63]I've been playing the game for like an hour, like two hours.
[155:58.63]I don't even know who Ares is.
[156:01.33]I don't have 4,000 hours in the game yet.
[156:06.34]I haven't even unlocked all the gods yet.
[156:12.75]Closer to the surface.
[156:16.35]I didn't even know Ares was in this game until you just told me.
[156:25.29]The Asphodel Meadows.
[156:27.38]It's literally Greek myth.
[156:28.72]I know.
[156:29.16]Nobody's going to get banned for trying to give me advice, okay?
[156:31.80]Please, relax.
[156:32.34]Or I will strike you down, chat.
[156:34.54]I will do sub only 20 minute time to talk.
[156:36.66]Alright, I want maybe, no.
[156:58.56]Is there a key here?
[157:11.40]See you later, alligator.
[157:12.64]Skullcr- Alright, I gotta play.
[157:17.53]Land.
[157:18.77]Land!
[157:28.81]That was a pretty good chain.
[157:40.90]That was a pretty good chain.
[157:41.76]Don't go in the lava and chase him.
[157:50.31]What are you doing?
[157:53.47]This game is outdated.
[157:54.49]Play something new.
[157:55.02]Didn't this come out like four months ago?
[157:57.81]It came out this year.
[158:03.21]Saints Row 2 waiting room.
[158:05.53]It's outdated.
[158:06.55]Uh, pomegranate.
[158:19.50]Play something fun for once.
[158:24.61]This game is fun.
[158:29.73]Are some of you guys mad that this got nominated for Game of the Year or something?
[158:49.45]I can't reach.
[158:49.99]Come over here.
[158:52.29]I don't want to go in the lava to fight you.
[158:59.54]Wow, they have explosives.
[159:08.71]Did I get hurt?
[159:09.13]Did that hurt me?
[159:11.97]Oh no, I got hurt.
[159:13.33]I got hurt.
[159:26.97]No, not... I didn't say anything after hurt.
[159:34.71]You want me to say a particular rock after that, don't you?
[159:42.78]Good enough to eat.
[159:43.66]Okay.
[159:45.36]That's chain lighting, too.
[159:49.12]Or more hangover.
[159:50.26]I think I want more hangover.
[160:01.68]Okay, we got shop or gems with a fight.
[160:09.27]Hmm.
[160:14.71]Cool.
[160:20.75]Each character gives you a trinket on their first gift, so give a gift to everybody.
[160:25.57]I will, definitely.
[160:26.15]Okay.
[160:36.04]Jesus.
[160:36.52]Okay, these guys are a lot different.

[161:45.74]Ever since that LEGO Star Wars stream, my kid's been asking me what the word fuck means.
[161:50.79]And I can't explain it to them.
[161:52.41]They love their uncle.
[161:54.51]Whatever.
[161:59.78]Hmm.

[163:19.49]Nice to meet you.
[163:19.89]Good to see you again.
[163:23.73]Hi there.
[163:24.53]No need for formalities.
[163:25.51]I'm Zagreus.
[163:26.65]Just heading out on some official business past the menacing bone hydra.
[163:30.23]Don't mean to be rude.
[163:31.63]And I'm just curious.
[163:33.99]Does that come with jalapenos?
[163:38.11]Yes, it does.
[163:39.11]It comes with jalapenos.
[163:45.12]Well, don't you have your hands full, hon?
[163:47.50]I'll let you go.
[163:48.82]But there's one rule in my place.
[163:50.54]Gift.
[163:50.76]Which is, nobody leaves here empty-handed.
[163:54.21]You got that?
[163:55.55]So take your pick.
[163:57.03]My treat.
[163:59.55]Is that Casadelica with jalapenos?
[164:06.17]Alright, let's see.
[164:07.90]Up to two random boons of yours are upgraded to the next rarity.
[164:10.82]That's pretty awesome.
[164:13.46]Four random boons of yours gain level one?
[164:16.28]Plus one level?
[164:17.56]Isn't the porridge just better?
[164:23.02]A rare and fragrant beverage.
[164:30.28]The next three boons you find have upgraded rarity.
[164:33.15]Yes, that one.
[164:34.53]Sure, here.
[164:37.13]Thanks so much.
[164:37.89]Can I eat some of this?
[164:42.37]Can I give a gift?
[164:47.72]It's not like some of those games where you can... Some of those games that exist where there's fighting of non-playable characters and... I didn't say it.
[165:08.04]I didn't say it.
[165:09.82]See you.
[165:10.48]See you.
[165:13.97]Like you can fight characters that are non-playable.
[165:17.77]Alright, this is a boss fight.
[165:35.34]Stack the fuck out of this.
[165:52.98]Ah!
[165:56.29]What am I doing?
[166:10.34]Oh wait, you can hit that?
[166:11.12]You can hurt yourself?
[166:13.14]Is that for real?
[166:17.45]Hit yourself.
[166:30.02]Die.
[166:30.48]I have a feeling I'm going to lose really badly to the dragon thing.
[166:54.67]Here we go.
[167:01.31]Wait, your hangover effects also make those slower.
[167:05.52]Your dash causes a hangover several times near where you started.
[167:18.41]That third one's not very good.
[167:22.51]22% slower move speed, that's really good, but this is good too.
[167:34.76]They're all pretty good.
[167:38.84]But this one is... You get max health when you pick up any gift.
[167:46.02]Every time.
[167:48.78]This one... Wait, hold on.
[167:50.12]Your dash causes a hangover several times near where it's going to stack.
[167:56.74]I want this one.
[168:00.34]That's 1, 2, 3.
[168:02.60]4, 8, 12.
[168:03.22]That's 12.
[168:04.10]That's like 50 damage.
[168:06.30]So you go in.
[168:06.89]Oh, man.
[168:07.73]This is going to be good.
[168:09.01]So here you go.
[168:09.41]You go.
[168:10.23]You get in.
[168:11.15]Stop.
[168:11.57]Drop.
[168:12.05]Right?
[168:12.47]Holy shit.
[168:13.01]Yeah.
[168:13.41]You do double tap, right?
[168:15.17]So you get in there.
[168:16.55]You do Y. Double tap.
[168:18.07]And they'll go.
[168:21.53]Get in.
[168:22.01]Smash.
[168:22.33]Double tap.
[168:22.65]I feel like that's going to be good.
[168:39.64]Somebody will always be hung over here.
[168:41.32]Holy shit, that's really good.
[168:47.34]Yeah, that's gonna be good.
[168:49.42]I'm just gonna be a... This is a coward run.
[168:53.02]Yeah, this is a coward run.
[168:59.11]Yeah, this is an absolute coward run.
[169:08.92]Just stack it.
[169:23.34]Still alive?
[169:25.52]Get out of here.
[169:34.93]Two, two, two, two, two.
[169:36.81]Good, good.
[169:39.41]Did I already give Zeus a gift?
[169:40.79]I don't think I did, did I?
[169:47.89]Not yet, right?
[169:53.31]Lord Zeus, uncle, please accept this offering and all my gratitude.
[170:00.27]That's the flash.
[170:01.09]Oh.
[170:01.19]He took an honorable weapon and made it a coward's weapon.
[170:04.82]The Thunder Signet.
[170:05.54]We'll see what that does later.
[170:25.99]Do you dash just before getting hit?
[170:28.99]A bolt strikes a nearby foe.
[170:32.11]Your chain landing effects bounce more times than before.
[170:34.83]Alright, that's four times.
[170:38.98]That's huge.
[170:45.04]Alright, let's keep going.
[170:46.96]Max health or pomegranate?
[170:51.25]I'm gonna die.
[170:53.39]Or shop.
[170:54.09]Shop.
[170:58.75]Holy shit, Zeus raid?
[171:00.07]No way.
[171:01.66]Zeus!
[171:04.98]What were you doing today, man?
[171:06.46]I've already done this.
[171:07.08]We did this joke already.
[171:09.86]Like, a long time ago.
[171:11.25]Did I get just another key?
[171:17.69]I don't have another gift.
[171:19.37]I think I can get them all.
[171:22.32]No, I can't.
[171:26.31]definitely taking the key alright key max health or uh die Dallas whatever let's go whoa holy shit that's um that's a hang of every attack does hangover so I can dash in there hangover slash
[171:54.58]But is that better than Zeus?
[171:59.30]I mean, I'm gonna do it.
[172:00.08]I mean, I have to do it.
[172:08.83]So this is just like, get in, slash, slash, slash, get the fuck out.
[172:11.57]Like, it's just total poison.
[172:17.41]Because that's 7, 14, 21, right?
[172:18.95]If I go 7, even 1.
[172:20.49]Dash in, that's 7.
[172:23.13]Dash out, that's 14, 21.
[172:25.23]And if I get this in there too, that's just like 30 damage a tick.
[172:29.84]Just go in there, go wham, dash out, go.
[172:32.38]And just run around, just run away.
[172:35.02]It's 14 per second.
[172:37.74]Holy shit, okay.
[172:40.13]Zeus left.
[172:41.95]Don't worry, we're gonna get raided by, uh, Ionesses soon anyways.
[172:46.77]Zeus viewers leaving, whatever.
[172:48.24]Alright, I'm probably getting my ass kicked, but whatever, let's go.
[172:50.82]Here we go.
[172:59.06]I will keep coming back, just like your stupid heads.
[173:10.20]It's pretty good.
[173:16.21]Just eat this!
[173:16.61]What am I doing?
[173:29.35]I'm freaking out.
[173:29.83]Alright, here we go.
[173:30.62]First wave.
[173:33.94]Itchy nose.
[173:46.22]We got... Shit.
[174:18.82]Pretty good.
[174:20.48]It's pretty good, man.

[174:50.16]Wow, he's gonna swing.

[174:56.44]Alright, I'm good.
[175:28.61]Good spot.
[175:38.71]Jesus, this is such a terrible spot.
[175:41.81]I'm good.
[176:13.17]Oh my god.
[176:31.75]One more.
[176:34.78]Just be careful.
[176:40.20]Alright, get ready.
[176:46.06]Easy!
[176:50.69]FUCK!
[177:26.29]No, I didn't know he's gonna do that again.
[177:29.63]Oh I didn't know he's gonna do that again.
[177:34.83]I thought he was gonna shoot.
[177:37.01]Oh, I just fucking got so greedy damn it That is so much harder with melee.
[177:45.28]Oh who said that I'm gonna slice you.
[177:47.00]Oh
[177:55.74]I was so close.
[177:58.38]Yeah.
[177:59.60]I saw the big number.
[178:00.88]I saw the 300 crit.
[178:02.70]I was like, get in there and die.
[178:04.91]Fuck.
[178:07.99]Ugh.
[178:08.21]Dude, when they spawn those five dragon skeleton shit, that shit's fucked.

[178:53.36]Father, what happened to the lounge?
[178:55.36]The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here and you seal it shut.
[179:03.59]Oh, I had little choice about that, boy.
[179:06.15]You see, after you fled the first time, Cerberus... Well, I have a bunch of keys.
[179:11.45]Utterly tore the place to shreds.
[179:13.75]It's now under repair.
[179:15.95]All thanks to you.
[179:19.57]I think I can get all the weapons.
[179:20.35]Blaming me for not minding the dog while I was out and while you all were here.
[179:27.07]I lay the blame entirely upon you, yes.
[179:29.55]Who else?
[179:30.71]It's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then.
[179:34.51]Come to his senses, I should say.
[179:37.07]May you yet come to yours.
[179:39.97]What's all the paperwork he's doing?
[179:43.92]Did they talk about that yet?
[179:46.30]If I don't pet your other heads, don't bite my arm off, do you?
[179:56.75]Cool.
[179:58.69]Let's go get the other weapons.
[180:00.85]Or, or not.
[180:01.43]So that, like, woo!
[180:02.33]Did my limiter come in and just try to kill that?
[180:04.23]Did it even help?
[180:05.33]No.
[180:31.37]It didn't help.
[180:32.55]I have a limiter on.
[180:33.55]It should have at least squelched a little bit of that.
[180:40.88]It's too late.
[180:42.50]We heard everything.
[180:54.32]the house shall stand eternally although in what condition it is ours to decide our obligation is to keep the house in order alright I'm gonna go check on the uh you're right of course you're right this game's really good I'll do my best I'm having a lot of fun I'll do my best for both our six snakes what was that about I don't know you're the nosy one
[181:23.56]Let me take a look at my quests.
[181:28.65]Okay.
[181:30.97]Freddy Dredd just gave 50 bucks.
[181:33.13]What's up, Freddy?
[181:36.51]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, Freddy.
[181:39.91]Freddy says, I freaking love this game.
[181:42.99]It's very good.
[181:45.79]I can do anything.
[181:49.50]Well, ooh, hold on.
[181:51.08]Okay, wait.
[181:52.66]Should I use the keys on the mirror or use the keys on the... Let's get the weapons first, right?
[181:59.15]Yeah, give me the weapons.
[182:03.07]Thanks, Freddy.
[182:04.47]Thanks for the huge, insane amount of money.
[182:06.47]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[182:11.55]Yeah, I'm going to lock the weapons and then we'll go from there and I'm going to see which one I actually like the most.
[182:19.04]They'll get the coward's shield.
[182:22.24]I'll try it.
[182:22.62]So, I can't get both.
[182:23.42]I can get shield or I can get spear.
[182:24.92]Let's see what this is.
[182:27.84]The shield.
[182:28.16]Okay, X is bash.
[182:50.03]There's no combo.
[182:50.75]It's just one.
[182:51.45]Hold to defend.
[182:53.47]Okay.
[182:55.99]And when you release, you dash forward.
[183:03.15]That's a huge dash.
[183:06.42]Throw.
[183:07.20]Oh, you throw the shield.
[183:08.44]Okay.
[183:15.38]And then this is... You can do this while dashing.
[183:24.48]If you hold it, it blocks all damage.
[183:26.64]Really?
[183:26.88]Okay, I'll try it.
[183:32.53]I'll give it a try.
[183:33.07]So, does it block all damage that's inside of those lines?
[183:40.33]Or is it like 180 degrees in front of the character?
[183:50.82]Just that front.
[183:51.44]Just those lines.
[183:52.04]Okay.
[183:52.14]Cool.
[183:54.59]What's this new thing I got?
[183:55.73]The next boon you find will be from Zeus.
[184:00.99]His blessings have plus 10% chance to be rare.
[184:06.41]Hmm.
[184:06.53]I think this one's just better for me anyways.
[184:15.39]I get to come back to life twice.
[184:18.22]I feel like it's necessary.
[184:19.12]Alright, let's go.
[184:22.28]Wait, there is a combo.
[184:23.04]Is there?
[184:23.95]That was weird.
[184:24.39]How come I just went... Oh, I guess you can do a little combo if you do the dash too.
[184:37.15]Yeah.
[184:38.36]You can do a combo if you do the dash.
[184:43.06]Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, Achilles.
[184:45.50]Where is he?
[184:54.24]Is he here?
[184:54.54]Gift.
[184:55.58]Codex.
[185:18.83]Please, I insist.
[185:20.85]I want your love of history to grow, not just your love of warfare.
[185:24.96]Besides, maybe you can finish out the rest of it.
[185:27.74]I have a question for all of you guys that have played all of the super massive giant games.
[185:36.98]I really like this.
[185:38.80]Almost everything about it.
[185:46.25]I passed on Transistor and I passed on Bastion.
[185:53.08]Should I play them?
[186:03.91]Bastion is like this.
[186:08.17]Bastion especially.
[186:09.27]Okay.
[186:12.27]Higher.
[186:12.63]Wait, is Bastion by the same company?
[186:17.06]Yeah, it is, right?
[186:19.40]Okay.
[186:24.10]Denied?
[186:24.56]What?
[186:24.76]Alright, so this is just lore codex.
[186:34.68]Undiscovered?
[186:35.28]Okay, cool.
[186:37.34]Got my lore codex.
[186:38.34]Thanks, guys.
[186:42.76]Yeah, because I don't know.
[186:44.30]Transistor and Pi, they didn't do it for me.
[186:47.75]I wasn't into them.
[186:48.25]I was like, eh.
[186:51.29]Are they like this?
[186:53.17]I feel like this is different.
[186:54.31]Okay.
[187:12.36]Alright, let's just try it.
[187:15.52]Fire is the most different, okay.
[187:19.27]How many times have I referenced one of the four games so far?
[187:21.21]I believe twice.
[187:23.21]Once accidentally.
[187:24.05]So I don't know if it counts.
[187:27.03]One absolutely, absolutely least once.
[187:29.91]Finally, Ares, right?
[187:38.86]Okay.
[187:39.08]Doom.
[187:39.18]Your attacks inflict doom.
[187:39.94]After a brief moment, the victim takes a burst of damage.
[188:06.96]Okay.
[188:07.56]Does it happen after every swing?
[188:12.89]Your special inflicts doom.
[188:14.27]I feel like that's better because it's ranged.
[188:17.47]Your dash creates a blade rift where you started.
[188:22.05]Doom does not stack.
[188:23.33]Yeah, this one's probably way better because it's ranged.
[188:25.58]Yeah, I mean, that's an extra 60 damage on ranged.
[188:32.04]Holy shit.
[188:32.64]Yeah, that's incredible.
[188:33.26]That's incredible.
[188:37.44]It doesn't stack.
[188:39.04]Yeah, but still, I mean, I can do... This is a coward run.
[188:41.38]Wait, I should be looking for chests, shouldn't I?
[188:44.02]Didn't I unlock that?
[188:44.86]This bounces too?
[189:07.33]I want to test the damage reduction.
[189:08.41]What can I do that to?
[189:09.29]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[189:16.67]Now, are there any, is there any caveats at all with that?
[189:20.15]Or is it truly just, you can just eat damage forever?
[189:24.21]If I just sit like this, I can absorb 100, every second, all damage, no matter what.
[189:29.54]Forever.
[189:32.66]That's very useful.
[189:33.92]Can I cancel it?
[189:35.94]Can I cancel it?
[189:37.24]Or do I have to dash?
[189:40.66]Okay.
[189:45.28]Well, here's something I will say.
[189:47.70]All the weapons so far have been very, very interesting and very different.
[189:52.41]Do I want money or do I... What's this one?
[189:56.39]This is a god, right?
[189:59.85]Yeah, that's a god.
[190:12.93]Very good.
[190:15.29]That Doom is so good on the shield.
[190:16.87]It's so good.
[190:28.08]You just have to touch him too.
[190:29.50]It just bounces around all over the place.
[190:31.20]I don't have any gifts, right?
[190:37.34]That's a bandwagon opinion.
[190:41.96]Whatever.
[190:42.74]Okay.
[190:48.56]Your attack is stronger and can deflect.
[190:51.84]Well, uh... That seems to be very, very good.
[190:58.22]Because now I can block all damage and just hit back all projectiles.
[191:07.09]Does the block count as an attack?
[191:09.66]Because if it is, I can launch it.
[191:11.70]I can just sit there, right?
[191:12.44]It does.
[191:17.10]No, I'm seeing... No, it doesn't.
[191:19.26]It does.
[191:19.70]It does not.
[191:20.22]No.
[191:21.00]I don't want this one.
[191:26.67]I mean, it's going to be this one.
[191:30.95]Your wisdom guide me.
[191:38.37]First is better, yeah.
[191:41.74]So, can I... Wow.
[191:43.78]Even... Not even projectiles.
[191:45.32]It's everything.
[191:49.02]This is incredible.
[191:52.55]Oh, my God.
[191:53.05]It's so good.
[191:54.23]It's so good.
[192:00.68]And with the doom on it, too.
[192:14.81]It's so good.
[192:16.97]It's so good.
[192:22.40]That's broken.
[192:24.86]Well, I mean, not maybe a little.
[192:47.00]broken at all I mean I don't I don't think it is you have to look you have to really really stand still and things can just spawn behind you in this game that's not good but it is very very good though like very good this is the kind of play style I like safe
[193:14.45]It hits everything in a line, too.
[193:15.77]Alright, that's a little broken.
[193:17.49]That's a little overpowered.
[193:18.65]That it can hit everything in this line, not just the first enemy.
[193:30.62]We gotta build on this, though.
[193:31.86]Oh.
[193:31.96]I don't know.
[193:38.88]More damage with the attack, but more doom damage.
[193:43.79]Yeah, of course.
[193:44.69]Absolutely.
[193:48.15]Should I do more keys or should I go for upgrade run?
[193:57.07]Key.
[194:01.75]This is a boss.
[194:05.19]Where is it?
[194:07.67]Oh shit.
[194:09.27]There's blocks, that's right!
[194:10.03]Alright, where are you?
[194:21.42]Where are you?
[194:23.50]Oh, how are you an elite?
[194:26.55]That's an elite?
[194:30.01]I guess you're doing a shitload of bombs.
[194:36.02]Oh my God, it is a lot.
[194:38.08]Oh my God.
[194:43.55]Alright.
[194:44.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[194:45.29]Kill this guy.
[194:56.52]Oh, this is the real coward.
[194:57.94]This is the real coward move.
[195:05.27]That key.
[195:08.20]This is total cheese.
[195:11.78]That's another Ares door.
[195:13.98]Yeah, I'm going to be able to upgrade Doom again.
[195:26.67]Alright, let's do this.
[195:27.91]Wait.
[195:29.11]Don't be an idiot here.
[195:30.17]Hold on.
[195:31.11]Just because you can block everything doesn't mean you need to block everything.
[195:44.76]This is Doom run.
[195:45.78]Yeah, it's just Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom.
[195:48.30]Alright, don't freak out.
[195:50.86]Just dodge.
[195:55.98]Just bounce it around.
[196:16.18]Nice work.
[196:17.58]Lucky Tooth?
[196:18.39]Rank up?
[196:20.73]What happened?
[196:21.73]I've ranked up Lucky Tooth?
[196:27.80]I gotta give this guy a gift.
[196:30.50]Seriously.
[196:36.53]Keepsakes level up the more that you use them.
[196:38.63]Oh, okay.
[196:38.81]Oh, that's right.
[196:39.31]It was like 25,000 points or something.
[196:40.37]Ooh, what's this?
[197:08.22]What?
[197:09.54]Hold on.
[197:09.86]Wait a minute.
[197:10.32]I need to look at this.
[197:12.30]Your dash creates a blade rift.
[197:13.90]Who cares?
[197:14.95]Your doom effects deal more damage when applied multiple times.
[197:18.69]Ugh.
[197:19.93]But the duo, your abilities that can deflect immediately activate doom.
[197:27.58]So I put the doom effect and then I just hit X and it'll detonate.
[197:39.30]Really?
[197:40.44]So I can go just... Throw shield, X, throw shield, X, throw shield, X, throw shield, and it'll just be 100, 100, 100, 100.
[197:49.67]With extra combo damage.
[197:53.59]Oh, shit.
[198:00.47]Alright, don't... I'm not gonna get complacent here, because this feels like this could be really good.
[198:09.26]I gotta watch my health, take care, be easy.
[198:12.07]Because I will blow this.
[198:14.39]I will ruin this whole thing.
[198:15.29]Oh, shit.
[198:17.31]Oh, nice.
[198:17.53]So I just got a free fountain.
[198:18.61]I don't have enough money.
[198:23.42]What is that?
[198:40.09]Is that two gods in one?
[198:41.13]That's a duo in there.
[198:41.87]Oh shit, let's do it.
[198:42.55]Alright, I'm gonna play good.
[198:44.05]This is an elite room.
[198:45.74]Let's see how this works.
[198:46.78]Wait, what?
[198:49.88]Okay.
[199:08.37]Whichever god I don't pick will be very mad at me.
[199:12.01]So who do I pick?
[199:14.06]Ares again and just go full doom?
[199:20.46]Okay.
[199:29.50]Rift?
[199:30.34]Your cast sends a blade rift hurling a head.
[199:32.66]I don't care.
[199:35.38]After you take damage, inflict doom on foes around you.
[199:39.82]After using Death Defiance, deal more damage that encounter.
[199:43.32]That's okay.
[199:46.82]I mean, this is the one that's a synergy here.
[199:48.48]I mean, if I take damage, it'll just do them.
[200:00.55]They all kind of suck, actually.
[200:01.65]I'm going to stick with this.
[200:07.01]This Doom build.
[200:09.74]Now she's mad.
[200:10.04]You angered the gods.
[200:10.48]Hey!
[200:10.62]Hey!
[200:10.74]Hey!
[200:43.34]Why you?
[200:45.76]It's so good.
[200:50.86]What are you linked to?
[200:51.56]I took too much damage here.
[201:05.07]Oh, now Athena gives me some cool shit.
[201:11.71]Now then, I hope we can move past this little incident and keep our focus on the task at hand.
[201:18.40]Half-Life 2 Crowbar?
[201:19.96]Gong, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong.
[201:27.36]Uh, I don't have a cast.
[201:29.78]But this is just... Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed.
[201:35.27]I need a cast though, don't I?
[201:40.33]This is really good.
[201:51.02]This is just straight up 5% damage.
[201:52.36]5% is not that much though.
[201:56.90]Yeah, just take the bonus damage.
[202:06.15]Just bonus damage.
[202:06.95]Just take it.
[202:09.15]Alright, keys or gems?
[202:11.65]Let's get keys so I can get the spear.
[202:24.55]Easy.
[202:26.41]Oh my god.
[202:26.81]Okay, I'm fine.
[202:31.23]Just throw the shield.
[202:32.05]I don't have to do anything.
[202:32.73]Just throw the shield and block attacks.
[202:34.29]I'm good.
[202:45.62]Who's next?
[202:54.82]Whoa!
[202:55.20]What happened?
[202:55.60]He exploded.
[203:07.36]I'm sorry.
[203:07.76]I'm loud.
[203:08.22]I know.
[203:08.74]I'm sorry.
[203:15.49]I'm going to go away from the mic.
[203:17.27]Locked.
[203:25.08]Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce.
[203:35.49]Oh my God, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[203:37.97]Stay in the corner for a second.
[203:40.61]Bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it.
[203:59.22]Wowie.
[204:09.05]What the fuck is happening?
[204:10.05]Fuck.
[204:12.11]Taking too much damage from these vrums.
[204:20.65]Throwing.
[204:21.11]No, I'm not throwing.
[204:21.92]I'm good.
[204:26.18]I'm going to get my ass kicked by that fucking goddamn snake boss again.
[204:30.46]I have to take damage.
[204:40.89]I kind of don't want any of these.
[204:45.13]But here's a cast.
[204:54.13]This is good too though.
[204:58.15]Yeah, I'll take three.
[205:06.96]12 health for 23.
[205:08.04]What a terrible, terrible waste of money, but I need it.
[205:12.84]Ain't a random item.
[205:18.09]Do I get this?
[205:20.57]Ain't a random item offered from the well of Charon.
[205:23.15]Maybe.
[205:23.37]Random item.
[205:27.29]Should be handy.
[205:28.47]What is it?
[205:33.11]And 20% movement speed.
[205:36.64]Kind of sucks.
[205:38.30]Oh, alright.
[205:38.92]I need the health.
[205:39.42]I want the health.
[205:39.94]This is probably... I know, but the hammer's good, but I only have 50 HP.
[205:46.68]Always hammer?
[205:47.62]No!
[205:48.22]I need the health so bad!
[205:49.63]I'm gonna die to the snake skeleton thing!
[206:09.82]Who's next?
[206:14.16]Okay, we're good.
[206:25.63]Hammer.
[206:27.37]Your dash strike deals 50% damage in a larger area.
[206:31.62]Your special can strike up to four additional foes before returning.
[206:34.90]Your ball rush charges faster.
[206:39.16]That's really good.
[206:41.16]That's very good.
[206:44.35]I can hit four people.
[206:45.77]Okay, now I'm getting the health.
[207:01.18]Thank you.
[207:01.54]75.
[207:02.74]And here's the boss.
[207:04.42]Alright.
[207:05.00]Let me pee first before this.
[207:06.46]This fight's a piss fight.
[207:07.36]I gotta pee.
[207:08.93]I'll be right back.
[207:10.43]This is a stupid bone animal.
[207:13.83]Wait a minute.
[209:27.06]I am ready to tackle this.
[209:29.56]The best part about this is I can just hold X and block the machine gun.
[209:34.30]So I just have to get through the insane five-person snake encounter.
[209:43.34]And I'll be good.
[209:45.16]Theoretically, right?
[209:45.82]I can just sit here and go like this and block the whole thing and then go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, run away.
[209:54.94]Oh, it's Meg.
[209:55.94]Right.
[209:58.61]Oh, well, fine.
[209:59.69]Whatever.
[210:01.29]What the hell is this weapon?
[210:07.70]It's just a ribbon.
[210:09.00]That's a prank lightsaber.
[210:26.79]this place can't stay sealed shut forever make in the meantime I thought I'd get some practice in you know I'm not your practice partner well you're the first boss of like eight rooms floors or whatever you are wow that hurt a lot what the was I doing
[211:00.84]Don't be an idiot.
[211:01.74]I'm good.
[211:03.20]I think I peed out all my gamer sense.
[211:04.72]I really think I did.
[211:11.15]Can you do that?
[211:11.65]Is that possible?
[211:14.57]I think I like pissed out all my vitamins.
[211:24.09]Fucking trap.
[211:24.96]I swear to god it hit me again.
[211:36.32]It's the second time I got hit by the dumb trap.
[211:41.17]Oh my god.
[211:41.91]I pissed out all my gamer sense.
[211:43.55]I really think I did.
[211:46.79]I feel visibly slower right now.
[212:01.38]You're going to pay for this.
[212:27.77]Okay.
[212:28.83]I like peed out all my skill.
[212:33.14]When I was peeing, I felt it too.
[212:34.96]It was like, yeah, I'm ready to do this, boss.
[212:38.88]I'm slowing down.
[212:40.40]I'm like slower and relaxed.
[212:45.70]What am I doing?
[212:46.12]I'm playing a game right now.
[212:59.43]I'm okay though.
[213:00.18]Enjoy the searing heat of Asphodel.
[213:02.24]It wasn't even that hot.
[213:04.64]It was okay.
[213:07.66]Hey, it's my keepsakes.
[213:08.70]150.
[213:10.20]Alright.

[213:13.75]Always.
[213:17.41]Don't sell anything.
[213:22.69]Searing heat of asshole.
[213:27.62]Up we go.
[213:29.86]We're done.
[213:32.32]Alright, come on.
[213:33.86]Let me get back to tower number three.
[213:37.37]Ice level.
[213:40.63]I need some gamer fuel or something.
[213:42.63]Not the drink, not the powdered fucking sugar stuff.
[213:46.53]No.
[213:47.17]I need some gamer energy.
[213:48.99]How do I get it?
[213:52.66]You can no longer say the word game fuel without it being game fuel TM.
[214:04.42]I need something.
[214:05.52]What do I need?
[214:06.02]I need something.
[214:16.85]Oh my god, I'm on fire because I held the button in there.
[214:20.05]Oh my god.
[214:33.05]Oh, no.
[214:33.54]Don't dash here.
[214:34.36]Don't even block here.
[214:35.00]You're going to go in the lava.
[214:52.13]I forgot I even had the lightning bolt thing.
[214:58.39]Give me that.
[215:00.77]All gamers, raise your hands.
[215:02.36]Jerma985 needs your energy.
[215:05.04]No, I don't, I don't need that.
[215:06.70]I need, I need like peanut butter.
[215:10.34]You have that?
[215:10.80]Do you guys have any peanut butter?
[215:18.29]Hype, hypers.
[215:31.02]Somebody came behind me and, like, put, like, a sack over me.
[215:41.29]Uh, what should I do?
[215:51.56]I'm free to do as I may.
[215:53.22]Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[215:56.83]Within, a humble residence in Asphodel reverberates the golden-sounding voice of Lorne Eurydice, who once attempted to escape the underworld.
[216:06.16]Aw, shit.
[216:06.88]Cool.
[216:07.30]It's Eurydice.
[216:08.50]Gift.
[216:08.78]Gift, gift, gift, gift, gift, gift, gift, gift, gift, gift.
[216:23.89]You ready to see?
[216:24.33]You ready to see?
[216:25.11]You ready to see?
[216:25.99]You ready to see?
[216:26.53]You got the evergreen acorn.
[216:27.87]What is it?
[216:54.56]Evergreen acorn.
[216:55.92]Okay.
[217:00.53]Where is it?
[217:02.87]Evergreen acorn.
[217:04.53]What's it under?
[217:09.57]Don't have it.
[217:11.09]Idiot.
[217:11.39]You have any peanut butter in here?
[217:12.64]Alright.
[217:25.40]Next three boons you find have upgraded rarity.
[217:29.00]Up to four random boons gain plus one level.
[217:33.32]Or two random boons of yours are upgraded to the next rarity.
[217:36.26]Hmm.
[217:44.27]Probably this one.
[217:46.73]Let's do one.
[217:50.71]Ursa Vengeance and Blinding Flash got upgraded.
[217:57.78]Oh, that was bad.
[218:02.58]Oh, that was very bad.
[218:03.94]Come on.
[218:04.84]What's the percentage there?
[218:05.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8?
[218:07.57]Really?
[218:07.73]2 out of 8?
[218:08.19]Well, whatever.
[218:09.21]Sucks.
[218:10.47]See you again.
[218:11.13]Farewell, Your Majesty.
[218:27.26]Somebody said chat actually sucks at this game.
[218:31.21]Well, do they?
[218:31.89]I don't know.
[218:32.39]That must be one of those infernal trolls.
[218:42.99]Don't even let him attack.
[218:43.69]Just kill him.
[218:51.19]Wow!
[218:51.87]He almost just... I gotta stack that shit up.
[218:56.13]You know what I mean?
[219:08.53]Yeah, I gotta be doing that like xy xy xy xy.
[219:11.77]Just 140 damages.
[219:17.13]You've been choosing good stuff on accident and chat has been suggesting terrible stuff on purpose.
[219:24.19]Prove trial?
[219:27.41]Earned up to $100.
[219:27.77]Oh.
[219:27.85]The challenge.
[219:32.91]Come and get it.
[219:49.20]Okay.
[219:50.72]Alright, that's a... What?
[219:54.09]Oh, I thought... For a second, I thought he said I didn't get it.
[219:56.03]I was gonna say, that's bullshit.
[220:02.23]Oh, there's a new god!
[220:15.12]Come.
[220:19.50]Oh my goodness, get out.
[220:25.24]Come on, dude.
[220:26.16]Really?
[220:26.70]Oh, fuck me.
[220:36.45]Hermes, you better be worth it.
[220:37.35]Did I miss that?
[220:48.49]Alright, Hermes, you better have something cool.
[220:50.17]Like, restore all health every second.
[220:52.35]Mercury!
[220:52.75]Mercury!
[221:14.66]Each time you enter a chamber, gain a bit of wealth.
[221:17.64]So I get 10 gold every time I go into a new spot.
[221:21.78]Old castifier in rapid succession.
[221:24.91]Dash.
[221:25.55]You can dash more times in a row.
[221:26.97]Wait, that's three dashes in a row.
[221:30.43]This is such a good build.
[221:36.33]Please don't waste it on me being terrible at everything.
[221:41.25]Restore 10% of your health when you go into a new chamber.
[221:43.75]Yeah.
[221:49.18]That's three chambers.
[221:50.90]10% of 75 is 7.5.
[221:57.26]Gain this instantly.
[221:58.48]And... Okay, I'll take them all.
[222:03.15]Give me all of them.
[222:10.17]Alright, here we go.
[222:18.94]Oh, these explode.
[222:23.18]Just activate them now.
[222:23.72]They're going to kill me.
[222:27.59]These will kill me.
[222:28.11]I know they will.
[222:28.59]Just activate them now.
[223:04.75]Kill him!
[223:11.50]Holy shit!
[223:25.95]Why do I dodge into the dash into the dodge into the glom?
[223:28.97]Alright, I'm good.
[223:35.99]In the name of Hades.
[223:38.63]Ooh.
[223:44.04]Ooh.
[223:46.24]Wait.
[223:46.90]How many... Your dash deals damage and can deflect.
[223:53.80]But... Oh.
[223:55.57]But this is... I get extra health points.
[224:00.41]This triggers doom.
[224:01.33]Doom.
[224:04.38]Reflecting does Doom.
[224:09.58]Look at this crazy build I've got going.
[224:32.18]Shit, this is pretty... Okay, pay attention.
[224:40.75]You're gonna die, clown!
[224:46.02]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[225:02.44]128 for Doom.
[225:08.24]Yeah.
[225:09.30]Definitely won.
[225:12.44]That's a 30% increase in damage.
[225:20.99]Where should I go?
[225:25.72]Okay, max health, the shop, or Hermes again.
[225:30.54]Oh, this is tricky.
[225:31.42]I don't know.
[225:34.06]Max health or the shop.
[225:35.92]I don't know.
[225:37.74]Oh, this is so hard.
[225:38.58]They're all good.
[225:46.43]I have like 300 plus dollars.
[225:48.61]I gotta spend it.
[225:55.70]Yes, what a good choice that was.
[225:59.83]Care to provide me any insight as to just what sort of hideous monstrosity awaits me over on the next infernal island, Chiron?
[226:10.29]Not bad, huh?
[226:11.42]That's... Let's do this first.
[226:14.24]Aye.
[226:17.42]We do.
[226:18.42]I knew that foul boatman would come through and you would find a monster's wares this gift.
[226:30.32]Your attack, special, and cast deal more damage.
[226:32.92]That's just more damage.
[226:36.78]Yeah.
[226:39.38]13% more damage.
[226:40.34]Alright.
[226:41.06]Now let's buy the pomegranate.
[226:45.50]Your dash deals damage and can deflect.
[226:49.22]After you take damage, your foe is struck by lightning.
[226:51.48]Or backstab bonus.
[226:53.20]Probably this one.
[226:53.87]Probably not going to happen that often.
[226:59.19]I don't care about damage on this one because it's doing boon already.
[227:05.66]I don't get extra boon damage, right?
[227:13.36]Oh, yeah.
[227:13.90]This one.
[227:18.57]And then I'll take the meal.
[227:20.53]I'm ready.
[227:21.99]I'm ready for the boss.
[227:22.79]This is it.
[227:23.67]I have to beat this guy.
[227:25.11]Okay.
[227:28.99]Okay.
[227:29.19]Alright, I'm gonna be quiet, and I'm gonna do this right, and I'm gonna try, and I'm gonna just do it very, very closely.
[227:37.50]I'm gonna just defend, and then all hell's gonna break, break, listen, five spawn, but let's go.
[227:41.99]No more talking.
[227:44.51]Here comes quiet gamer time.
[227:50.16]Don't you have something to say to me?
[228:04.05]What did I do that for?
[228:04.73]Oh my god, what happened?
[228:06.29]Here we go.
[230:15.20]Yes, yes, yes, I'm good.
[230:17.62]If you choke, I'll delete my account.
[230:19.12]Well, uh, it almost happened.
[230:25.54]What do the diamonds do for you, anyways?
[230:28.98]I'm glad you didn't have to delete your account, dude.
[230:30.61]Alright, let's move on.
[230:31.15]It's for upgrades.
[230:31.95]Ooh.
[230:46.77]special upgrades get a good refresh here uh gain 20 movement speed for yeah why not whatever alright this is how far I got last I got to the the minotaur last time
[231:13.20]Is it an acorn?
[231:15.26]The final encounter in each underworld region takes zero damage for the first three times you get hit.
[231:22.62]That's pretty big too, though.
[231:28.69]Just think about it.
[231:29.37]Getting hit once is bad.
[231:31.35]Getting hit like more than twice is bad.
[231:37.03]I took one hit from the boss and took 20 damage.
[231:40.45]If I revive with 50 damage, 50 health...
[231:44.52]Wouldn't it just be better to block 60 damage if I get hit?
[231:54.12]I'm a boss?
[231:59.18]This is cool, though.
[232:02.24]Tooth is at 75.
[232:03.30]Oh, right.
[232:03.86]Because I've been playing and I upgraded it.
[232:06.24]Okay.
[232:06.36]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[232:11.71]Let's go.
[232:14.90]I think the boss is Medusa.
[232:23.41]It looks like it could be Medusa.
[232:25.51]Could be.
[232:27.85]Let's beat that Minotaur.
[232:28.79]Let's beat the Minotaur.
[232:40.25]Key.
[232:41.57]Key.
[232:42.99]I want to be able to unlock the spear.
[232:46.77]Don't come back here.
[233:04.28]Oh my god.
[233:04.88]What did he hit me with?
[233:06.86]Holy shit, dude.
[233:07.76]I'm getting way too confident.
[233:10.98]Stay back and play the way with the shield you're supposed to play.
[233:15.48]That's what's hitting me.
[233:16.18]Okay.
[233:26.35]The shield was gone for so long.
[233:31.27]Oh my fucking god.
[233:32.67]Why?
[233:33.47]Why?
[233:46.24]Jesus, that took, that was so stupid.
[233:48.29]I took like 30 damage for no reason.
[233:51.35]Whoa!
[233:51.99]Alright, relax.
[234:01.06]How many money?
[234:18.80]Watch out for that shit.
[234:29.74]Give me the shield back so I can kill him.
[234:44.96]Oh!
[234:46.53]That's a new enemy.
[234:47.65]I don't know what that does.
[234:56.52]Oh, it's the butterfly thing.
[234:57.42]Okay.
[234:57.58]What the fuck just hit me?
[235:20.64]I need to heal.
[235:23.76]He's forgetting to breathe.
[235:25.94]I'm sorry.
[235:26.42]Alright, good.
[235:28.18]Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[235:31.43]He forgot to breathe.
[235:35.21]Yes, thank God.
[235:36.53]This one's cheap.
[235:49.14]Zeus or the cheap pomegranate?
[235:59.22]It's a random.
[235:59.76]Oh, that's why.
[236:00.30]Somebody's talking about giving me Bitcoin?
[236:02.54]I feel like this is necessary now.
[236:26.29]Because now that's jilt.
[236:27.57]My special does... Yeah, let's do this.
[236:29.77]The special now, I can actually do it.
[236:32.05]It's better.
[236:32.41]Okay.
[236:34.59]I'm going.
[236:35.37]Health.
[236:42.03]You don't have jilt.
[236:43.15]I don't?
[236:44.45]Oh, wait.
[236:45.09]I don't?
[236:46.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[236:46.98]Are you sure?
[236:47.34]Come on.
[236:48.02]What?
[236:49.64]Don't I?
[236:52.86]Your lightning effects also make foes jilted.
[236:54.84]Yeah, I do.
[236:58.85]My special is lightning.
[237:03.20]Is my special lightning?
[237:04.70]Somebody has a fucking crosshair on me.
[237:16.55]Trying to hit this stupid thing.
[237:19.11]I want to hit the bomb.
[237:20.15]I'll do it myself.
[237:41.45]I'm up.
[237:42.45]Holy fuck!
[237:59.64]Got him.
[238:01.34]Not yet.
[238:03.24]Now I got him.
[238:03.94]Oh my god, get him.
[238:05.05]Yes!
[238:08.55]Extra HP!
[238:09.95]What's this?
[238:19.96]What are the choices here?
[238:21.24]Hammer?
[238:22.94]Or Zeus?
[238:24.46]No.
[238:24.94]Poseidon extra.
[238:26.94]Always hammer, right?
[238:28.16]Every time.
[238:34.64]chariots chariots are alive no oh they're gonna have to catch me aren't they
[239:14.17]You can deflect that shit back.
[239:15.13]Don't forget that, Jeremy.
[239:18.24]Hammer.
[239:20.78]Your bull rush gains a power rush that deals 500% damage.
[239:26.88]Your special deals 50 damage to foes around you when you catch it.
[239:31.19]Or your dash strike deals 50% damage in a large area.
[239:40.25]I mean, what does it do right now?
[239:45.41]Has anyone seen the numbers?
[239:46.27]I haven't really been paying that much attention.
[239:48.95]What does it actually do?
[239:55.63]You need to time it for the power rush.
[239:57.63]Oh.
[239:58.67]One requires actual skill.
[240:03.61]Okay.
[240:04.13]So, besides the passive-aggressive, you're terrible at everything.
[240:08.72]What's the best one to do?
[240:09.82]What do you think?
[240:12.90]Probably this one.
[240:15.76]Yeah, that works.
[240:21.41]Uh, key.
[240:22.37]Okay.
[240:34.05]How do I get that off?
[240:34.71]How do I get the cursor off me?
[240:35.62]What does it do?
[240:36.26]What does it mean?
[240:53.99]Oh, I'm very powerful right now.
[241:27.91]What the fuck?
[241:29.01]The stupid lightning rod things.
[241:34.90]I'm okay.
[241:36.32]I'm okay.
[241:43.27]Pomegranate.
[241:45.33]Pomegranate.
[241:49.33]It's double, I know, but I have to fight a bunch of horrible, scary things.
[241:56.69]Don't need it.
[241:57.39]I don't need it.
[241:58.79]Double, do double, duo double.
[242:00.43]No, but I don't need it.
[242:01.77]I don't need it.
[242:02.53]I don't need it.
[242:09.93]Should I just pick Ares?
[242:10.96]Just always pick Ares.
[242:31.69]Your Doom effect deals more damage when applied multiple times.
[242:36.53]Or your Doom effects deal more damage but take half a second to activate.
[242:40.43]Number three.
[242:41.47]Because I can activate it whenever I want.
[242:46.42]Definitely three.
[242:52.28]I'm taking three, man.
[242:53.14]60% more Doom damage?
[242:55.79]okay here we go holy shit
[243:29.41]Oh my god!
[243:30.03]Fuck!
[244:00.44]Still have no health.
[244:08.92]Your attack emits chain lightning when you damage a foe.
[244:13.70]After you dash just before getting hit.
[244:16.12]Or your cast is a burst of chain lightning that bounces between foes.
[244:20.90]I mean, yeah, I'll take the cast.
[244:24.75]Yeah, alright, we're good.
[244:27.41]I need money or health.
[244:30.35]No, I'll do Hermes.
[244:33.71]I have enough.
[244:34.11]I have enough.
[244:37.09]Yeah, I have enough money to buy whatever I need.
[244:45.76]I'm doing her.
[244:49.84]Come on, let's fight.
[244:50.80]I really miss.
[245:07.82]That dash to activate the Doom is incredible.
[245:09.88]Alright, Hermes.
[245:29.93]Give me some... Is that rare Hermes?
[245:31.85]I think that's a rare Hermes.
[245:34.28]Oh.
[245:39.43]After you dash, you become sturdy and can move 100% faster.
[245:42.41]Each time you enter a chamber, you get money.
[245:47.04]These are all terrible.
[245:52.04]Probably this one.
[245:53.88]This is going to mess me up.
[245:57.72]This is not good for me.
[245:59.22]I'm going to dash and I'm going to go too fast and walk into something.
[246:08.51]I know me, I know myself.
[246:10.97]Trust me, it's not good for us.
[246:12.25]Uh, alright, shop.
[246:23.51]Here we go.
[246:26.45]Yes, okay.
[246:28.39]Uh, give me the meal.
[246:30.87]Nice.
[246:34.13]Alright, here comes the boss.
[246:37.08]I've never fought this boss before.
[246:38.84]Should I just do all these?
[246:42.73]I could just do them all.
[246:50.17]Okay.
[247:00.21]Gain when you pick up that.
[247:02.51]Gain max life when you pick up any of those.
[247:04.83]That's probably what I'm going to do.
[247:06.68]Bonus damage per fountain.
[247:09.24]Using a fountain restores all health and gives you damage.
[247:14.32]It's this one.
[247:17.72]That gives me full health.
[247:18.66]No, well, pretend full health and then whatever this is.
[247:25.16]Curse of Pain, level 1.
[247:26.70]Okay.
[247:26.98]I don't know what that does.
[247:28.74]What is it?
[247:39.41]Curse of Pain level 4.
[247:42.24]Oh.
[247:44.94]Oh shit.
[247:45.60]Okay.
[247:47.22]Alright.
[247:47.64]Alright.
[247:48.12]Alright.
[247:48.78]Here's the boss.
[247:49.88]You ready?
[247:52.86]See if I can beat this boss.
[247:53.90]I'm going to be very careful here.
[247:55.02]Here we go.
[248:14.06]Oh, wow.
[248:14.96]Wait, it's the Minotaur.
[248:15.92]Beware, short one.
[248:17.70]Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only foe whom I've ever faced who bested me.
[248:23.57]That Hercules?
[248:24.11]Hold, fiend.
[248:27.03]You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
[248:34.57]Theseus, no way.
[248:35.79]You two are legends.
[248:37.21]I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here.
[248:41.73]Defend yourself.
[248:42.85]Fight them both at the same time?
[248:45.23]That's kind of unfair.
[248:46.37]Holy fuck.
[249:10.79]Oh, shit.
[249:11.37]Okay, I get it.
[249:11.78]Alright.
[249:14.00]Just don't say it.
[249:15.21]I was gonna get just 0.5 subs.
[249:39.21]Run into something, you fucker!
[249:54.29]Run into this pole!
[250:12.11]Oh my God, please let it do a pull.
[250:14.43]What's going on here?
[250:17.80]What's going on?
[250:34.10]Holy fuck!
[250:36.28]I'm in trouble!
[251:07.09]Bring me back, bring me back, bring me back.
[251:36.30]Oh, yeah.
[251:37.86]Oof.
[251:40.02]That was tough.
[251:42.04]Thank you.
[251:42.54]Thank you.
[251:42.88]Oh, I got a super juice.
[251:49.68]A super juice.
[251:50.36]Oh, I think this is a regular one.
[251:55.69]Wait, this is different.
[252:02.71]Cool.
[252:02.95]Alright.
[252:10.26]Who's that?
[252:10.52]Is that... Is that the king?
[252:12.38]Oh, up to the left.
[252:15.16]Come on.
[252:22.49]Look, you have a fan.
[252:23.41]I do?
[252:28.03]Red guy?
[252:28.53]That's my only fan?
[252:39.80]I just beat the two strongest guys in the Coliseum.
[252:41.86]That's bullshit.
[252:49.76]That was crazy.
[252:54.99]Anything new?
[252:55.75]No.
[253:00.13]I only have 20.
[253:00.87]Wait, is it enough to heal?
[253:01.82]No.
[253:04.18]That's expensive, but that's really good.
[253:13.31]Sell something for it?
[253:16.15]Hold on.
[253:19.09]What should I sell?
[253:24.80]I don't think I can sell enough to do that.
[253:30.32]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[253:31.28]I want, I want.
[253:33.06]Alright, so I have one more of these left.
[253:37.27]Is it worth switching it up now or just stay with what I know?
[253:46.03]Alright, well, let's go.
[253:49.00]I can do this.
[253:50.46]I can do this.
[253:51.20]We're getting closer.
[253:55.96]What have we got?
[254:04.65]The Temple of Sticks.
[254:10.28]Somebody said I swear to God if he beats this game in fucking four attempts.
[254:15.30]I don't- I highly doubt that will happen.
[254:38.45]Oh no, not this.
[254:42.56]Wait, I have to fight Cerberus?
[254:43.98]I told you I was gonna have to fight Cerberus.
[254:45.66]Am I at the end of the game?
[254:47.32]This feels like a... last area.
[255:02.74]I have to fight the dog.
[255:04.10]Alright, let's fight the dog.
[255:05.64]Let's go.
[255:05.96]Oh.
[255:22.44]There has to be a way to make you look the other way.
[255:25.24]What if I help you with the SATA problem?
[255:26.64]Would you let me go?
[255:27.96]He doesn't even care.
[255:28.90]Yeah, I do.
[255:29.68]I have to find Persephone.
[255:30.92]Oh my god, a human.
[255:31.80]Thanks to the five community subs.
[255:33.08]You know what this means to me.
[255:38.12]After a moment's hesitation and deliberation, the voracious hound of hell parks once, affirmatively toward the prince, who sets off in search of something that can say to the monster's appetites.
[255:48.88]Humans out.
[255:49.62]Humans out.
[255:50.38]Humans out.
[255:52.83]Okay.
[255:54.69]I have to find, like, a treat for him?
[256:00.13]Well, there's a lot of choices here.
[256:01.55]Hold on.
[256:03.72]Oh.
[256:04.98]Uh, are you sure this is not the... This is, like, the last... What?
[256:08.76]Are you sure this is not, like, the final area?
[256:12.90]I don't have any money to buy anything.

[259:06.39]I wish I had money.
[259:08.53]No, I don't have any money.
[259:09.91]I can come back to life one more time.
[259:14.27]Okay.
[259:16.19]Come on.

[262:10.98]What happened to this guy?
[262:21.58]That was a really cool fight.
[262:22.44]Okay, so now I go back.

[263:10.93]Come on, we gotta gamble.
[263:12.35]Yes!
[263:12.73]We got it.
[263:13.27]Refleinish one use.
[263:14.59]I got it.
[263:14.87]Hell yeah.
[263:35.84]And when I come back to life, I've been vulnerable for two seconds.
[263:38.46]Let's go.
[263:38.96]Fill it back up.
[263:41.31]I'm ready.
[263:41.67]Come on.
[263:45.69]Oh, I have to do... I'm going to do the money door?
[263:49.70]Yeah, I'm doing money door.
[263:51.46]Obviously.
[263:54.92]Go.
[264:07.52]Money door.
[264:25.43]Don't get poisoned.
[264:27.63]I'm very bad at getting away from the poison.
[264:35.64]I don't even know what these things do, but just kill them.
[264:40.75]Money.
[264:41.25]What's that?
[264:51.07]That's a big sack of money versus a little coin of money.
[264:55.21]I don't know which one.
[264:56.51]This is a restored 34.
[265:03.00]Okay, hold on.
[265:05.39]I can take them both?
[265:06.79]Go with your gut.
[265:07.60]I don't... Wait, can I do them all?
[265:08.90]I can take this, right?
[265:11.68]I can take them all.
[265:14.32]A quiet taste.
[265:15.62]Again?
[265:17.64]Disgusting.
[265:18.84]Cerberus will love it.
[265:20.92]Nice.
[265:21.46]Oh my god, I have $272!
[265:26.87]Going back.
[265:29.63]Okay.
[265:30.89]Hold on, I want to spend this.
[265:32.19]Chow time.
[265:32.83]Are you hungry?
[265:34.11]Anvil or health?
[265:40.01]I don't know.
[265:43.17]I think it's going to be health.
[265:44.01]I think it has to be health.
[265:45.87]Let's go.
[265:46.61]Okay.
[265:47.69]I... Wait.
[265:49.19]Okay, here we go.
[265:53.48]Talk to the dog now.
[265:54.44]Go back in for more money.
[265:57.10]That's a dangerous game that you want me to play.
[266:02.20]That's a dangerous game you want me to play.
[266:04.80]I have a full- I have a revive, and I have 140 health.
[266:14.44]Alright, boy, I got your favorite treat.
[266:16.86]But you have to promise to let me pass if I hand it over, okay?
[266:19.46]Alright, I'm gonna fucking zone in here.
[266:23.54]Terrifying Cerberus accepts the fetid sack and scans the darkened hall for where best to consume the stomach-turning contents.
[266:38.53]Alright.
[266:41.38]Let's relax a little.
[266:43.92]Let's go in.
[266:49.95]Here we go.
[266:53.16]Let's go.
[266:53.66]I'm ready.
[267:06.01]Oh, of course.
[267:07.37]I gotta fight him here?
[267:08.57]This is tiny.
[267:09.56]I never grew accustomed to the air up here.
[267:12.72]It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases.
[267:16.18]I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.
[267:21.58]you know you're right the air appear seems pretty good so far but I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill I have to say though father the helm of darkness suits you I'm touched you dusted off on my account dusty it should not have had to come to this for all your antics with me yet around the house I always kept my temper have I not unlike you it's your nose it's your face and then I'm gonna be dead silent
[267:47.45]Well, let's see.
[267:48.05]You've berated me repeatedly and often.
[267:50.06]This itchy flies all over my face.
[267:51.42]Get him off.
[267:52.02]...wretched forces to kill me over and over, but sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up.
[267:58.63]All that's about to change, then?
[268:02.41]He's nervous.
[268:03.69]I mean, kind of.
[268:04.73]I'm at the last boss.
[268:05.45]I'm alright.
[268:06.23]I'm alright.
[268:06.83]Here we go.
[268:07.29]I skipped the lore.
[268:08.23]Who cares?
[268:34.14]I suppose that you must hate the very sight of me.
[268:37.07]You'll understand then why I wear the Helm of Darkness.
[268:40.65]Darkness!
[268:48.38]Where'd he go?
[269:12.74]Fucking shield Don't make me laugh it's the last encounter Oh
[269:49.64]Darn it.
[270:24.62]Thanks.
[271:33.53]Let's go!
[271:35.50]Let's go!
[271:42.68]Let's go.
[271:43.32]I'm not going to celebrate prematurely.
[271:49.38]I don't know about this.
[271:51.24]I don't know about this.
[272:01.48]There's always a second phase, of course there isn't!
[272:15.91]Oh, that hurt!
[272:20.03]Oh, fuck, I thought I had it!
[272:22.47]I was like, yeah, so let's go!
[272:25.01]Oh, damn it.
[272:27.19]Oh, man.
[272:28.78]Shit.
[272:29.24]Damn you, father.
[272:31.22]Oh, of course he's got a second phase.
[272:33.52]Goddamn.
[272:36.13]Damn it.
[272:40.13]I'll take it.
[272:40.73]I'll take it.
[272:41.65]Wait, I give her the gift, right?
[273:01.45]Why not?
[273:01.73]Don't say SCP-2521.
[273:05.09]I just did.
[273:05.95]Coin purse.
[273:09.93]Well, dad's not even here.
[273:11.19]Yeah, of course.
[273:34.81]I'll take it, though.
[273:35.55]That was fun.
[273:37.63]I really thought I had it, too.
[273:38.85]Oh, well.
[273:39.61]Yeah, you never actually have it, right?
[273:41.43]Oh, I haven't even unlocked the fourth weapon.
[273:43.76]I should probably do that.
[273:44.62]Oh.
[274:03.13]Oh no, I wonder what became Medusa.
[274:05.93]She's always worried father's going to fire her even without something like this.
[274:11.67]Let's go.
[274:14.63]You don't like it when I pet your other heads, huh?
[274:17.03]No.
[274:25.24]Unlock some more things.
[274:26.20]Yeah.
[274:27.46]Oh, that's right.
[274:28.00]I have eight keys.
[274:29.24]It's five keys, right?
[274:30.36]What do I next went?
[274:32.34]Hmm.
[274:33.65]Not a bad idea.
[274:37.31]Oh, man.
[274:37.87]I got... Okay, cool.
[274:38.43]Three potions?
[274:39.33]That's good.
[274:39.61]Oh, fuck.
[274:39.83]I have a lot of these.
[274:42.75]Forty gems.
[274:43.19]Oh, not quite.
[275:00.99]Not quite.
[275:01.39]Alright, I got a lot though.
[275:04.33]Let's unlock the next tier.
[275:08.08]Boiling blood.
[275:12.42]Oh.
[275:14.08]Raise your supply of... That's... That's so necessary.
[275:32.58]Rip spear.
[275:34.16]Oh shit.
[275:35.24]Oh, oh well.
[275:36.68]I'm a shield guy, don't worry.
[275:40.38]Gift the dog.
[275:40.96]Yeah, I'm gonna go give gifts to everybody I didn't give gifts to.
[275:46.00]Gift the dog.
[275:49.14]Spear sucks compared to the shield.
[275:52.22]Really?
[276:04.94]Old spike collar.
[276:05.78]Okay.
[276:08.00]Also, I can do this.
[276:12.08]Add a fountain chamber.
[276:13.16]Chambers may contain urns with five coins.
[276:26.89]Or put a fountain chamber in Elsium.
[276:32.07]I probably should put a fountain chamber in every... I should probably do that first, right?
[276:44.06]Fountains first.
[276:45.34]Those rooms are so important.
[276:50.76]Underworld Innovation Fountains provides 10% more health than usual.
[276:57.63]Elysium.
[276:58.55]Oh, whatever.
[277:01.62]Okay.
[277:03.87]Now let's go give some more gifts.
[277:10.35]Who have I not given a thing to?
[277:11.57]Achilles?
[277:14.33]Anybody up here I haven't given this to?
[277:15.37]I didn't give one to Hades.
[277:19.21]He's not here anymore, though.
[277:23.75]Did I give one to... Does it say if I... Oh, it does.
[277:29.59]Okay.
[277:29.71]Okay.
[277:32.17]Okay, Poseidon.
[277:35.33]Holy shit, a lot of people need it.
[277:36.49]Did I give one to... Where is he?
[277:42.66]Where's Achilles?
[277:47.84]I did not give one to Achilles.
[277:55.95]Give me your treasure.
[277:56.83]What is it?
[277:58.13]A bracelet of some sort.
[278:00.56]Alright, I still have another one to give.
[278:24.56]Should I give a second one to Skeleton?
[278:27.24]You can give up to three, it looks like, right?
[278:34.33]Is there a reason to?
[278:35.47]Is there not a reason you shouldn't do it?
[278:37.01]What do we got?
[278:38.83]Let's see what that one does.
[278:40.41]Save a hundred coins to spend as you please once per escape attempt.
[278:46.12]What?
[278:47.84]So if I put this on, I get a hundred coins in the first floor.
[278:52.51]Is that every new floor, or is that just the start of each game?
[278:59.88]Just once.
[279:01.46]So you just put this on and then take it off.
[279:03.38]Okay.
[279:05.58]Take minus 20% damage from the front, but take plus 10% damage from the back.
[279:11.10]Ugh.
[279:14.07]And this is just plus 25 added health.
[279:21.75]Well, we'll just put this on and then take it off when we... Because I shouldn't be dying, right?
[279:26.09]Technically.
[279:28.42]What do you want to talk to me?
[279:29.80]Next.
[279:45.27]That pal is nobody's business but my own.
[279:47.94]Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time.
[279:51.04]Now back to beating me to powder.
[279:52.22]Pyrus?
[279:53.26]Oh, if it was Papyrus, it'd be, That pal is nobody's business but my own.
[279:57.12]Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time.
[280:00.70]Now back to beating me to powder.
[280:14.96]Don't do that again.
[280:15.54]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[280:16.18]Everybody has their way that he talks.
[280:19.25]And how dare you talk a different way than what's in my head.
[280:21.73]How dare you.
[280:28.05]Are there two other weapons?
[280:30.25]Or is that DLC coming up or something?
[280:37.50]Um, I kind of want to
[280:40.64]I know that I just almost beat the game with the shield.
[280:43.46]But, you know, I want to play some.
[280:46.28]I want to change it up.
[280:50.65]Let's go back to the bow.
[281:04.44]Bow users in chat.
[281:05.82]Yeah, I'm one of them.
[281:08.94]Count how many times I've gone up to the top left thinking I could lease.
[281:11.64]Alright, let's try it.
[281:17.10]Whatever.
[281:17.34]If I die in the first room, who cares?
[281:22.13]Whatever.
[281:24.85]Fuck the bow and fuck bow users.
[281:27.35]Okay.
[281:29.57]Oh, wait.
[281:29.91]I give Poseidon a gift, right?
[281:31.11]I didn't give him one, did I?
[281:32.53]Maybe I did.
[281:37.67]I did already.
[281:40.68]I didn't.
[281:41.18]Did I?
[281:41.42]I don't remember.
[281:45.88]Nope, I haven't.
[281:47.24]Hey, here.
[281:48.02]Take this.
[281:51.98]Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you, sir.
[281:54.61]So, please, this is for you.
[281:56.01]He gave one to Dionysius, right.
[281:59.45]Oh, I am positively moved by your affection, little nephew.
[282:02.39]Though I think I've just the thing for you in turn.
[282:05.11]Here, I shall transfer it to you.
[282:12.34]I'm going to press escape and hit give up to get a secret.
[282:20.71]Why?
[282:20.95]Alright, what's the gift?
[282:25.49]I can't even... I'm not going to do it.
[282:29.28]Is it like erase your save file or something stupid?
[282:34.03]It's no use.
[282:35.21]Oh, I didn't even take the gift.
[282:36.87]I didn't even grab anything.
[282:39.68]Well, what's this?
[282:58.62]Your call makes you surge into foes while impervious for 1.2 seconds.
[283:05.15]What the hell is this thing?
[283:08.21]350 damage max gauge bonus.
[283:12.47]Press RT.
[283:13.43]I don't know.
[283:15.92]Let me pay first.
[285:46.66]Okay.
[285:48.24]So, whatever happens here, this is probably going to be the last run.
[285:51.16]Because I have an appointment.
[285:52.60]I need to get to an appointment later this evening.
[285:56.90]Part of the reason why I started at, like, noon.
[286:04.25]So, let's go.
[286:09.97]So, this thing is... This is... Okay.
[286:14.10]This is a new move entirely.
[286:18.11]Press right trigger for an Olympian's aid if you have such a boon.
[286:23.14]Uses one stock of your god gauge for all four stocks for a much stronger effect.
[286:36.39]So, I have a new meter?
[286:42.16]So, right trigger uses it.
[286:46.74]Holy shit!
[286:54.99]I didn't even have all the moves in the game?
[286:57.61]Are you kidding me?
[287:00.81]Oh dear god.
[287:04.85]If you max it, it lasts longer.
[287:06.43]That does 350 damage!
[287:11.50]Wait for it to be max and do it in bosses.
[287:13.64]Oh my goodness.
[287:14.94]I'm looking forward to this.
[287:31.14]It resets every room?
[287:32.80]Oh, okay.
[287:36.00]So it's only for the current room you're in.
[287:37.66]How do you build it?
[287:39.00]Is there a better way to build it than how I'm doing it?
[287:40.54]Do I have to, like, string together, like, perfects or something?
[287:49.05]That's damage.
[287:49.57]That's it.
[287:49.95]Okay.
[287:50.78]Deal or take them.
[287:51.60]Maybe we get a hammer right off the bat.
[288:08.88]I'm getting a... Oh, I can't.
[288:10.68]Don't say it.
[288:11.06]You know, I don't even care.
[288:13.78]I'll give five more community subs.
[288:15.12]I don't give a shit.
[288:16.40]Okay, in Binding of Isaac...
[288:18.72]You know when you have an insane run that lasts a long time, and you have a ridiculous build that does very specific shit, and then you end up winning, or if you lose, you go back to just shooting regular tiers?
[288:33.17]I was able to dash three times before.
[288:37.25]And it's just completely different.
[288:38.83]It's fucking me up.
[288:40.11]Whatever.
[288:40.39]I'll give it five subs.
[288:41.07]I don't care.
[288:44.57]That's pretty good.
[288:50.82]Your power shot is easier to execute.
[288:55.08]Wow.
[288:59.88]150% more damage.
[289:02.62]Or two shots.
[289:05.09]They're all good.
[289:06.79]I'm doing this one.
[289:07.37]Uh, gems.
[289:23.70]What the fuck?
[289:25.32]Wait, what?
[289:26.44]This is doing a lot.
[289:28.53]That's a lot.
[289:29.55]That's a lot.
[289:30.91]That's the most of... Okay.
[289:34.05]Well.
[289:36.21]Sure.
[289:36.45]I think this is gonna be pretty good.
[289:39.96]That's a new god.
[289:58.58]This is insane.
[289:59.22]Don't kill this dude, he's a problem.
[290:14.02]One hundred... Okay, if I can do that again... And this is gonna be an ice shot.
[290:20.93]It better be, or I'm gonna be very, very upset.
[290:23.58]The last time I felt a chill like this was on the surface.
[290:26.97]But who?
[290:28.19]Well, one way to find out.
[290:29.63]Then, in the name of Hades, Olympus, I accept this message.
[290:32.79]I understand, young Zagreus, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold.
[290:42.57]Quite honestly, I fail to see why.
[290:45.29]You unlocked Demeter before you unlocked Spear.
[290:48.13]For plenty of assistance.
[290:49.99]And you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.
[290:53.00]Gilf?
[290:55.92]That stands for grandmother?
[291:06.41]Your attack is stronger and inflicts chill.
[291:09.55]Wowie.
[291:13.52]That's a big wow right there.
[291:19.66]And it chills.
[291:22.22]The cast drops a crystal that fires a beam at foes for five seconds.
[291:26.56]Yeah, but this is going to do like 225 damage a shot.
[291:32.47]I'm going for just straight up single shot death.
[291:37.51]I want more of this.
[291:57.67]um why is that excuse me hold on a minute here is there armored it's 203 damage you've got dude that's insane that's the most damage I've done this whole entire game and it's the first zone
[292:25.58]I'm just gonna make that dude like 400 damage a shot.
[292:45.10]Yes!
[292:47.58]That's good shit right there, man.
[292:58.50]Insane.
[293:03.40]And got health too.
[293:05.78]Which way?
[293:09.49]Oh, we upgraded it again.
[293:11.47]Do it again.
[293:14.73]Truly an item build for his massive ego.
[293:17.03]Okay.
[293:36.60]Fucking 145 damage is shot and I didn't even get started yet.
[293:39.96]Hey, Dad.
[293:43.07]You're fucked.
[294:06.59]I typically would be afraid of these guys.
[294:09.69]Anyone else?
[294:10.23]Let's do it again.
[294:15.34]Oh, wait.
[294:18.06]Your special is stronger and inflicts chill.
[294:21.68]That gives chill to my Y and makes it do like 40 damage.
[294:26.31]While all foes are chill affected, they are 15% slowed and decayed.
[294:34.50]Wait, while all foes are chill afflicted.
[294:39.94]And they take 30 damage every second?
[294:43.67]For how long?
[294:44.91]For 8 seconds?
[294:46.51]Wait.
[294:49.15]That sounds insane.
[294:49.91]Is that as crazy as I think it's going to be?
[294:54.15]So this can stack 10 times.
[294:58.52]And it's going to do 300 damage a second if I get it on.
[295:01.82]That's insane.
[295:02.34]That's insane.
[295:07.80]Ice cold.
[295:12.31]Holy shit.
[295:16.23]You're going to be a kiting god.
[295:22.04]These guys didn't even get an intro.
[295:23.04]They're dead.
[295:40.11]Oh, that guy got an intro.
[295:47.22]It's so good.
[295:49.50]Guys, I said it was an 89 like an hour ago.
[295:55.45]It's gone up.
[295:58.21]It has gone up.
[296:01.03]Man, freezing and water.
[296:17.30]Alright, I'm going to take... Let's take the chill first.
[296:22.32]Pick Poseidon, please.
[296:23.50]Trust me.
[296:28.99]Don't.
[296:30.03]No, I'm taking the cold.
[296:31.77]I'm going chill.
[296:32.99]Your dash shoots out a gust ahead of that afflicted chill.
[296:42.91]Okay, so this is just even more chill.
[296:46.23]Your boons become common, then gain rarity every three encounters.
[296:52.32]Wait, what?
[296:52.74]Well, I go back to one, and then every three encounters they upgrade.
[296:59.57]That's ridiculous.
[297:04.99]Holy shit, dude.
[297:05.75]I'm at one.
[297:06.61]Okay.
[297:06.79]If this is the one to go out on, this is the one to do.
[297:08.73]Oh my god, get them.
[297:09.33]I was so busy looking at the amazing damage that I just stood still.
[297:48.42]Oh, what?
[297:48.74]It's homing.
[297:49.44]Okay, that was confusing.
[297:57.44]Use the call?
[297:58.26]Oh, fuck.
[297:58.74]I forgot I even had it.
[297:59.65]I don't even remember I had that.
[298:15.75]I think I want the random assortment of treasure chests.
[298:19.09]Your dash damages foes in an area.
[298:22.25]Your boons with knockback affects your rupture.
[298:26.88]Come on.
[298:29.38]Rupture foes?
[298:32.94]But look, I can get a bunch of treasure.
[298:40.49]Ooh, okay, so it doesn't happen here, it happens here.
[298:46.19]uh alright a potion or a big chunk of upgradable fluid get the big chungus fuck
[299:38.30]Damn, this is so good.
[299:39.50]Okay, and I have a random quest encounter.
[299:45.76]What are you selling?
[299:52.92]sell sell sell what what do you mean sell what are you selling what do I do
[300:11.86]You said Big Chungus.
[300:13.70]Oh, right.
[300:15.10]Well, I mean, I was just replying to what somebody said.
[300:17.26]Within the depths of Tartarus reside the most wretched of all the shades who linger for eternity within the underworld, whose lord and master is especially unkind to those who... Somebody said it in chat.
[300:28.71]I'm just responding.
[300:30.25]Lots of wretchedness to go around, I guess.
[300:32.84]Hello, sir.
[300:35.71]Do I have any gifts to give?
[300:37.13]No.
[300:37.61]You know, Prince Ed, I'd not expect it to run into you again.
[300:40.55]Not after all this time.
[300:42.29]Something I missed out in the house or what?
[300:44.93]Not had much company of late is all.
[300:47.41]Worst stream and worst game?
[300:49.16]Alright, actually time that person out for five seconds.
[300:52.56]They are very lost right now.
[300:57.70]Well, something's just about always a miss back home, sir.
[301:00.48]Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus a bit more frequently.
[301:05.15]Have you ever filtered your piss?
[301:06.53]Uh, no.
[301:06.69]Okay, should I heal?
[301:07.17]Should I get that?
[301:07.73]Uh, probably the money.
[301:09.17]Or maybe total health.
[301:29.09]Yeah, let's get the health.
[301:35.75]Oh, piss in the Berkey.
[301:43.10]Right.
[301:43.70]The Berkey.
[301:44.24]I forgot about the Berkey filter arc.
[301:49.92]Oops.
[301:53.46]I got so caught up in getting that.
[301:55.16]Alright, so which one should I...
[302:01.99]Pee in the Berkey.
[302:02.99]Pee in the Berkey.
[302:09.89]I really would, too.
[302:10.84]I would do it.
[302:11.54]I would do it.
[302:14.44]Uh, let's take you.
[302:15.14]So, Hank.
[302:20.72]Actually, that'll be good.
[302:24.16]That'll be good, too.
[302:26.04]That'll also be good.
[302:33.55]I'm going with this one.
[302:37.09]Health is so good.
[302:38.27]Health is so important.
[302:39.05]Alright, let's go kill Meg.
[302:46.47]You never get casts.
[302:47.39]Who needs it?
[302:48.03]I got my strong arms.
[302:48.63]What hope could you possibly have in finding her up in the world out there?
[303:03.41]Let's freeze the fuck out of this lady.
[303:04.59]No, you can't.
[303:27.67]I don't know.
[303:28.03]Okay, I thought in the title, I thought that just said mod that guy instead of Megara the Fury.
[303:41.37]What happened?
[303:42.45]What's going on?
[303:56.89]Oh, you touched me.
[303:57.81]You touched me!
[304:09.04]Too far away.
[304:27.47]Step on a trap.
[304:43.09]Oh, you analog aimer.
[305:00.82]Meg, you're not even hard anymore.
[305:02.08]You were so- Remember I was like, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, look out, oh my god, I got killed by Meg!
[305:05.82]Meg, you're so easy.
[305:09.61]I'm so good.
[305:12.77]Oh, I just upgraded something.
[305:17.71]Nice.
[305:22.85]Toxic?
[305:23.29]She's like goddess of hell.
[305:27.92]Telling me I can be toxic to Satanic individuals?
[305:38.44]She, like, drinks people's blood.
[305:41.58]But I can't say, get out of here, you idiot.
[305:43.32]I'm good.
[305:50.33]You're a satanist.
[305:52.15]No, I'm not.
[305:54.80]I have done so much dark energy elimination from me.
[306:01.48]You are.
[306:01.82]I'm not.
[306:02.22]I've removed so many dark energies from me.
[306:07.15]Okay, your special deal is 40.
[306:08.23]Eh, I don't save it.
[306:09.25]I don't want to spend any money.
[306:10.13]Put the tooth on.
[306:13.69]Okay.
[306:16.65]I think I'm good.
[306:27.80]He's gonna have an enema.
[306:33.21]Nah.
[306:39.11]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[306:42.64]That's like a procedure.
[306:44.24]That's like a medical term.
[306:45.40]Sure, you could say, that's gross.
[306:48.02]That's a medical term.
[306:57.01]Why are you defending enemas?
[306:59.32]I did- I'm not.
[307:00.88]I'm just saying that that's a medical terminology.
[307:13.18]Stop.
[307:13.98]Stop, stop, stop.
[307:15.42]I saw somebody write something funny.
[307:25.03]I'm freaking out because I stepped in the... What?
[307:26.34]I'm made of ice.
[307:27.18]Why would I care about that?
[307:37.84]Ice melts.
[307:39.02]Ice cools down fire.
[307:46.32]Uh, pomegranate or money.
[307:48.65]Money.
[307:52.31]Ice cools down hot liquids.
[307:54.93]Okay, riddle me this, chat.
[307:58.01]If I had a, let's say, like the square footage of this square up here, and I dunked in an ice cube that was as big as your house, what would happen?
[308:11.50]Would that temperature of this lava, would that temperature of this hot liquid cool down?
[308:18.97]Yes, it would melt, but it would cool down whatever it was.
[308:22.11]It would make it colder.
[308:27.06]It would explode.
[308:27.92]It would not explode.
[308:29.20]It would explode.
[308:39.35]It would because of the heat.
[308:52.35]No, it would not.
[308:52.81]It would not explode.
[309:02.37]We get a link?
[309:03.87]Let me see.
[309:06.61]Who made you the psychics professor?
[309:08.15]Wait, what?
[309:13.92]You missed something?
[309:14.76]What did I miss?
[309:16.26]Why?
[309:23.78]Remember, you missed an NPC that gives free dash upgrade.
[309:26.66]Location of Bob Hadiz.
[309:33.63]What the hell is Bop-a-deez?
[309:37.37]Bop-a-deez?
[309:38.69]That's not even a real person.
[309:41.13]Bob Hades?
[309:46.35]Bop-a-deez.
[309:50.69]Bop-a-deez.
[309:57.81]That doesn't even make sense.
[309:59.77]What do you mean, bop-a-deez nuts?
[310:03.05]What do you mean, bop?
[310:05.87]Like, I'm punching you in the balls?
[310:08.25]What are you talking about?
[310:14.06]Hey, you streamer, bop-deez nuts!
[310:17.38]I don't think I want to do that.
[310:18.66]I don't think I want to punch you in the balls.
[310:22.24]Hey, bop-a-deez nuts!
[310:32.62]It's F. Bof?
[310:37.74]Bof?
[310:39.20]What word are you trying to say?
[310:48.12]Bofa?
[310:49.20]Bofa?
[310:52.50]What is Bofa?
[310:57.98]Oh, Bof!
[311:04.64]Okay, I was like, what is Bofa?
[311:06.26]Like, what the hell is Bofa?
[311:07.66]Bof's supposed to be.
[311:09.58]Bofa.
[311:12.50]What is this?
[311:12.97]I've never seen this before.
[311:13.75]I thought it was like Boppities.
[311:18.61]I don't even know.
[311:19.17]Whatever.
[311:19.49]I'm gonna buy this.
[311:20.47]Hahaha.
[311:35.47]Ooh, your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby people.
[311:44.02]Might as well.
[311:47.24]Thunder time.
[311:48.62]I think I'm going to save my money.
[311:51.38]Well, you know what?
[311:51.78]Let's roll the dice.
[311:53.08]What do we got?
[311:54.44]Idle Dash.
[311:55.42]Nice.
[311:56.40]Ooh, nice.
[311:57.10]Buy the Bunger.
[312:05.19]Oh shit, what time is it?
[312:06.35]I got time.
[312:06.69]Oh, this place sucks.
[312:08.43]Just dash when I need to and just cause absolute destructive damage.
[312:40.30]Oh shit.
[312:42.12]Whoa!
[312:42.54]That's a lot of people right there.
[312:43.60]This motherfucker's rough.
[312:54.69]These guys have the goddamn damage mitigator.
[313:10.27]I didn't get hit, did I?
[313:14.91]Oh yeah, let's go.
[313:17.37]Did I give over?
[313:18.49]I got a rarity upgrade.
[313:27.63]Is this a god build now?
[313:30.79]Did I give her a gift?
[313:32.19]Let me check.
[313:35.18]I have not.
[313:38.12]Let's give Athena a gift.
[313:41.15]I'm indebted to you, goddess, for all that you and your side of the family have done for me.
[313:46.61]What's this thing?
[313:47.83]Well, it simply isn't in my nature to allow such offerings to go unanswered, noble cousin.
[313:52.86]In turn, I wish for you to have this, with my compliments.
[313:56.36]B-boppities.
[313:57.68]Lady Athena, thank you.
[314:02.01]Owl pendant.
[314:07.64]What do we got?
[314:08.20]What is it?
[314:08.66]Your special is stronger and can deflect.
[314:09.96]It's going to replace that.
[314:11.12]But... Okay.
[314:11.34]Hold on.
[314:11.62]This is just 7% straight up damage.
[314:40.63]That's pretty good.
[314:45.95]That's good, too.
[314:48.81]You know what?
[314:49.23]Yeah, I'll take just a straight up 7% reduction in all damage.
[314:55.11]That's pretty good, I think.
[314:57.39]Most of the time, it's 5.
[314:58.59]And plus, that can upgrade itself, right?
[315:02.49]Every three rooms, that might just get grabbed and be 10%.
[315:14.54]Get out of here.
[315:15.32]You're nothing.
[315:26.46]Drop.
[315:26.96]Drop.
[315:27.40]Drop.
[315:34.90]It's a 92 right now, by the way.
[315:38.79]And potentially still climbing.
[315:45.35]I think I'm going for the health.
[315:56.02]Go back, go back.
[315:56.80]What?
[316:01.59]Restore 10% when you enter a chamber.
[316:03.01]That's pretty good.
[316:04.89]Go back.
[316:05.41]Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos.
[316:12.09]Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos.
[316:15.06]There's chaos down here.
[316:21.00]That is an ominous looking portal on the ground right now.
[316:23.30]Minus 25 health?
[316:23.84]What the fuck is this?
[316:32.81]So all I need to do is sacrifice some of my life essence to go in here.
[316:36.05]Okay, let's try it.
[316:37.65]Ah, don't see why not.
[316:42.19]chaos oh what is that uh within the underworld's quietest most solitary darkest abyss the god of chaos evidence of the beginning of all things of chaos the most ancient sculptor who is the god of chaos this world and best take all the evidence I find is there a god of chaos
[317:11.96]This is not someone I recognize.
[317:15.24]So, in the name of Hades, um, hello?
[317:18.67]May I ask who's calling?
[317:20.83]Gonna be Kronos.
[317:24.31]If the beings of Argon soft, would you not agree?
[317:27.33]Can I turn?
[317:29.72]Can I leave?
[317:30.12]Can I turn around?
[317:34.02]Um, have we met?
[317:41.36]What are you holding?
[317:42.84]Earth?
[317:43.20]Are you trading me one Earth for something else?
[317:47.64]What do I have to give you for Earth?
[317:49.56]Popper shot.
[318:06.02]The next three encounters, you cannot earn money.
[318:08.76]Afterward, your cast deals plus 30% more damage.
[318:12.58]The next four encounters, you take 377% damage from traps.
[318:14.76]After, you deal 34% more damage.
[318:16.30]Holy shit.
[318:16.83]Your dash has 50% range.
[318:18.77]You deal 65% damage.
[318:20.05]Okay, it's two.
[318:20.77]It's absolutely two.
[318:22.05]Holy shit.
[318:37.94]Very, very cool.
[318:38.90]Alright, let's go.
[318:43.92]How much does damage is trapped to?
[318:48.48]It's like 400% of what?
[318:50.08]Try it.
[318:58.53]It's 40.
[318:58.95]So it would be, it would kill me instantly.
[319:01.57]Lava counts as a trap.
[319:02.61]Okay.
[319:02.73]I gotta be careful.
[319:09.60]What is this one?
[319:12.24]Jeremios.
[319:13.36]Jeremios.
[319:14.62]In Greek mythology, Jeremios, Prometheus, however you pronounce that, possibly meaning short, is a titan of god of rats.
[319:24.95]Jeremios is a bad streamer and balding who is most known for being two and a half trillion silver in debt to the Olympian gods.
[319:31.34]His dump truck ass and his delusional conversations with hallucinations in his head, collectively known as chat,
[319:38.76]The best part about this is these are hyperlinked.
[319:42.81]His dump truck ass is a link to another article.
[319:53.25]Not dump truck, not ass, his dump truck ass.
[320:01.18]So that means my ass has its own Wikipedia page.
[320:04.50]Interesting.
[320:11.98]This one's... Alright, I'm gonna keep going.
[320:13.68]I gotta, like, hurry up.
[320:29.59]Mega fucking LOL.
[320:30.73]Alright, I gotta keep going.
[320:32.04]I might have to leave in the middle of this run.
[320:33.72]I'm not even kidding.
[320:36.02]How much is this meal?
[320:37.12]48.
[320:37.34]That's a lot.
[320:39.52]I don't need it.
[320:43.50]Finally, a cast.
[320:46.02]Wait.
[320:48.99]Maybe three.
[320:51.53]Yeah, three.
[320:59.34]Yeah, I gotta leave very soon.
[321:03.64]I gotta leave soon.
[321:06.14]I love this game though.
[321:13.10]I'll beat this boss and then I'm gonna call it.
[321:15.70]We'll pick it up again.
[321:24.92]Holy shit.
[321:25.50]Look at this damage.
[321:26.02]Are you kidding me?
[321:29.42]He's already had 50% health almost.
[321:32.03]Alright, let's go.
[321:45.85]I gotta be careful here, though.
[321:46.83]I don't have very many movement abilities.
[321:48.27]Don't kill me.
[322:03.56]Check the lava.
[322:05.12]No.
[322:05.98]No, thank you.
[322:07.44]I won't.
[322:19.70]Machine gun.
[322:20.96]Alright, last one.
[322:26.28]Holy shit, I'm taking damage here.
[322:36.67]Oh, fuck.
[322:38.07]Oh!
[322:38.63]Oh my god!
[322:49.60]This is unbelievably powerful.
[323:09.33]Oh, fuck.
[323:10.23]It's okay.
[323:11.09]I've... Remember, every time I get hurt and die, I have to go...
[323:38.96]Aye, what the fuck?
[323:39.96]Oh, there's one idiot left.
[323:49.14]200!
[323:49.98]200!
[323:50.00]200!
[323:50.02]200!
[323:50.04]Enough.
[323:51.98]Hooray!
[324:01.02]That was plus 100.
[324:05.04]Holy... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[324:06.76]Wait a minute.
[324:07.12]Is that increasing?
[324:09.41]Wasn't that like 20 last time?
[324:10.61]Thank you, John, for the five community subs.
[324:22.39]And this is MC for the five community subs, too.
[324:29.13]Alright, how much time is it?
[324:30.15]I got a little bit of time.
[324:31.13]I have a little bit.
[324:31.73]I have just enough time to do the three encounters.
[324:35.15]So, when I play this, like, tomorrow, I don't forget about it, step in a trap, and die instantly.
[324:41.84]Oh, Slippers DLC came out today.
[324:43.60]Ah, I know.
[324:44.04]A lot of things are around, aren't they?
[324:45.50]I want to see what these are.
[324:53.54]The next boon you find will be from Athena.
[324:56.58]And her blessings have a 10% chance to be rare.
[325:01.36]Next boon you find will be from Poseidon.
[325:04.22]But you can just game this, huh?
[325:05.27]Yeah, I'll keep the tooth.
[325:08.81]I don't have any money to do anything anyways.
[325:12.79]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[325:14.47]Let me just do this.
[325:15.11]Let me just do this.
[325:15.79]Let me just get this done.
[325:16.67]I have what?
[325:19.59]Two more rooms to do?
[325:20.31]One more room?
[325:22.01]Or I instantly die when I step in lava?
[325:24.10]Or step in a trap?
[325:29.26]Where are you?
[325:29.56]Always hammer.
[325:29.90]Three more rooms.
[325:30.46]Okay.
[326:02.87]Oh, don't let him touch anything.
[326:08.13]Who's left?
[326:09.20]Oh, you.
[326:18.86]Who's left?
[326:20.28]Oh, a chariot.
[326:28.77]Don't you dare.
[326:29.55]You know what?
[326:41.20]What do we get?
[326:43.18]Your attack hits up to three foes.
[326:45.65]Dealing plus 15% more damage for each.
[326:48.95]Your special fires four times.
[326:52.31]Or your special pierces foes and deals 400% damage to armor.
[326:55.05]That's pretty good.
[326:56.07]That's the armor breaker.
[326:56.97]But this, I mean, I don't know.
[327:01.02]It's probably one.
[327:01.60]Your attack hits up to three foes.
[327:05.50]Yeah, and more damage, of course.
[327:07.16]Only two more encounters.
[327:12.88]Money or Hermes?
[327:15.58]Hermes.
[327:18.76]We got a good link here?
[327:19.82]Hold on.
[327:21.88]Hold that thought.
[327:26.62]I get hit by it?
[327:27.18]Oh, it's because they're on fire.
[327:28.79]Oh, shit.
[327:29.23]Okay.
[327:29.35]Okay.
[327:44.46]Watch it.
[327:49.36]Why doesn't it have cats?
[327:59.41]What the fuck is hitting me?
[328:04.55]Cats, the music.
[328:13.93]I haven't seen that movie.
[328:15.51]It sucks.
[328:16.21]But who cares?
[328:17.21]It was like $500 million to make it.
[328:19.23]Can you imagine?
[328:22.12]What happened to my... Hello?
[328:22.86]My controller's fucked up?
[328:24.44]Uh, what?
[328:41.75]That was weird.
[328:43.13]Hermes.
[328:43.35]Good.
[328:43.47]Bonus charge one.
[328:44.43]Yeah.
[328:44.55]I mean, you have to.
[328:45.14]I don't even care what the other ones are.
[328:46.56]The other ones could be god powers and I don't care.
[328:48.26]Hermes thighs.
[328:48.60]Whatever.
[329:09.69]Is it?
[329:10.18]Oh my god.
[329:10.92]Okay, here's... Here's the... We've clicked on the hyperlink apparently.
[329:18.75]You can see it from orbit.
[329:48.67]God damn it.
[329:53.85]What the fuck?
[329:55.49]Alright, let's go.
[329:57.46]What time is it?
[329:59.40]Wait, that's a trap.
[329:59.98]That could have killed me.
[330:02.50]Oh, the mirror.
[330:08.68]Let's fight.
[330:12.71]I won't touch the traps, no matter what.
[330:13.73]Okay.
[330:18.10]Let them explode.
[330:19.12]On their own.
[330:19.48]Don't come near me.
[330:27.88]Dermadump 1.
[330:28.70]Dermadump 2.
[330:29.60]Dermadump 3.
[330:30.58]Dermadump 4.
[330:31.24]Dermadump 5.
[330:31.94]Dermadump 6.
[330:32.60]Dermadump 7.
[330:33.22]Dermadump 8.
[330:33.92]Don't touch that spirit.
[330:47.13]Still alive.
[330:52.47]Oh my god, the traps do 5,000% more damage.
[330:54.89]What am I doing?
[330:55.59]Be careful.
[330:56.01]Fuck.
[331:08.18]My nose is itchy.
[331:08.76]Hold on.
[331:20.68]Watch out!
[331:21.44]Okay, did I do it?
[331:22.18]Okay, now I do 34% more damage.
[331:23.23]You gonna be late?
[331:23.79]I'm not.
[331:24.15]I got a minute to just get my bearings.
[331:44.12]Alright, so here's an interesting thing to do.
[331:48.11]I already have 7% damage reduction.
[331:50.63]When I'm below 40%, that's 17%.
[331:54.71]Using a fountain will restore all your health and give you damage.
[331:59.72]Probably for the best.
[332:01.48]But, wait a minute.
[332:04.24]Don't I... Is there a fountain even down here?
[332:08.14]Did I even upgrade that yet?
[332:13.15]Restore up to 100 health.
[332:14.82]Alright, let's go.
[332:15.26]Watch it, watch it.
[332:47.79]Alright, how much did I get?
[332:49.61]52, that's enough.
[332:51.39]So slow.
[332:52.13]I just... I got a full health.
[332:58.03]Alright, what time is it?
[332:59.13]Alright, I gotta go.
[333:00.45]I have to leave.
[333:02.21]But hold on, let me go to the shop first.
[333:10.22]And... Here's the fee.
[333:17.91]Oh, shit.
[333:18.53]Okay.
[333:18.93]I can level this up.
[333:23.55]450 damage?
[333:25.07]That's pretty damn good.
[333:29.93]Okay.
[333:30.58]Uh, how do I save the game?
[333:33.68]Wait, but hold on.
[333:34.44]I can get this part.
[333:35.24]Alright, alright.
[333:35.70]Fine, fine, fine.
[333:36.20]Alright, alright.
[333:36.70]I'm done.
[333:36.96]I'm done.
[333:37.24]How do I, um... Am I good?
[333:44.60]You can't.
[333:49.48]Clear this chamber to quit.
[333:51.24]Go to the next room and it will save.
[333:52.36]Okay.
[333:52.48]Alright, I'm good.
[333:54.79]Let's do... I want ice.
[334:04.77]I want to save... Hold on.
[334:05.83]I want to get the ice first.
[334:06.77]Okay.
[334:23.97]This game is... I love this game.
[334:25.37]It's very good.
[334:26.25]I'm playing this tomorrow.
[334:27.89]I'll see you tomorrow for this game.
[334:43.38]I know what they're doing.
[334:46.22]I feel like I know... I know they're regenerating.
[335:04.77]Who's left?
[335:07.43]Oh, 50.
[335:07.87]That's so much damage.
[335:08.89]It's insane.
[335:09.41]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[335:10.77]Alright, let's do... Alright, I gotta fix this by tomorrow, because this is happening.
[335:15.13]I'm losing connection to my controller for some reason.
[335:17.75]If that happens in the middle of a game, that would be horrible.
[335:21.13]In the name of Hades...
[335:24.82]Okay.
[335:29.93]Any health effects are more potent.
[335:31.95]Restore 62 health now.
[335:35.19]Or your cast drops a crystal that fires- Oh, that's pretty good.
[335:41.76]And I can do two of these?
[335:47.60]Oh, now that's gonna be- that's gonna be awesome.
[335:53.42]And two of those can go down at the same time.
[335:55.34]That's insane.
[335:56.44]Okay, so.
[335:57.13]Progress saved a minute ago.
[336:02.95]So go through here and save progress.
[336:10.53]I have to go now.
[336:11.95]Did it save already?
[336:21.31]Alright, this game's awesome.
[336:24.47]I'll play it tomorrow.
[336:26.21]See if we can beat it tomorrow.
[336:26.91]I feel like I'm getting close.
[336:31.76]I will see you later.
[336:32.48]I have an appointment.
[336:33.32]I have to go.
[336:38.15]Or actually, this is medical stuff, so I might come up with some interesting scenarios after today.
[336:43.94]I'll see you tomorrow.
[336:45.10]Tomorrow we're going to start more normally.
[336:46.92]I'll be somewhere around like one or two.
[336:49.78]Two, probably.
[336:50.40]Maybe one.
[336:52.30]Somewhere in that range.
[336:53.22]Two.
[336:57.62]I do have to leave very, very soon.
[336:59.04]That's why I... Let's do the credits.
