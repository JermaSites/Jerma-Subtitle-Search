[00:36.53]Good to see you.
[00:38.65]How's everybody doing?
[00:43.99]Looks like we got some worms worms party here.
[00:53.57]One week ago, we said, hey, you know what?
[00:56.83]Why don't we play Worms WMD?
[01:01.54]And here we are, the same group.
[01:04.98]Look at us.
[01:05.54]We made plans.
[01:06.48]Isn't that cool?
[01:10.49]What does the title mean?
[01:12.85]WMD.
[01:13.53]WMD.
[01:19.79]It's just for one day only.
[01:20.79]That's right.
[01:21.94]For one 10 minute period only.
[01:24.94]Will you make a podcast already?
[01:26.20]No.
[01:26.32]Guys, I'll do three episodes of a podcast and you'll never hear it again.
[01:38.59]Please.
[01:40.57]What do you mean please?
[01:42.00]Please do a podcast.
[01:46.03]I don't want to do a podcast.
[01:49.74]Maybe a food podcast would make sense to me.
[01:52.68]But not just a general podcast.
[01:59.47]I want three episodes.
[02:05.71]Well.
[02:08.61]Sorry, you're going to have to be a no.
[02:09.65]No.
[02:17.54]hypothetically who would you bring on a podcast uh I don't know dude I would my this this is not real this is not real what I'm about to tell you is not real and it is not going to be real this is a joke it is just a a what if joke scenario my first podcast would be with captain crunch and I would I would try to get the actor
[02:46.41]That's like the only thing I can think of that would make me laugh.
[02:50.42]Is do like do a podcast and they go the first episode one.
[02:53.48]Who do we got?
[02:54.42]Oh, it's this like celebrity.
[02:55.96]It's this streamer.
[02:56.78]It's this YouTuber.
[02:58.45]No, no, it's an animated Captain Crunch.
[03:00.43]We talk about cereal.
[03:02.89]And it's the actual actor.
[03:04.45]This is none of this is not happening.
[03:06.01]It will never happen.
[03:06.85]I'm telling you right now.
[03:08.46]Just delete that from your brain.
[03:09.80]That was a funny little thought joke we just did.
[03:28.33]I would just do it with fake fictional people.
[03:33.53]That's like Glue Man would be on that.
[03:35.49]My first episode would be Bugleberry.
[03:38.01]It'd be me and Bugleberry and we would just go back and forth and I would just talk to myself for 30 minutes.
[03:42.63]Not happening, by the way.
[03:43.82]Just wanted to make sure we understand that.
[03:47.00]You should get Darth Vader on your podcast.
[03:59.64]Okay, do you think Darth Vader would come on my... would take an invitation to my podcast?
[04:04.67]Do you think so?
[04:05.85]Dude, this is just a Rick and Morty episode now.
[04:20.72]We got Darth Vader!
[04:22.20]Darth Vader on the podcast!
[04:23.48]Darth Vader!
[04:25.41]Hey, Darth Vader, why'd you kill all those people, Darth Vader?
[04:29.36]Why'd you do that for?
[04:30.10]Death Star was a piece of shit, huh?
[04:34.44]It was a bad, bad product.
[04:37.54]And then he makes a Death Star in 10 minutes and proves to Darth Vader on the podcast, look, I just made a better Death Star.
[04:44.29]Look, you just had to close this one hatch.
[04:45.95]How could you not have known that?
[04:49.35]Don't snooze to that.
[05:02.88]That was amazing Rick impression.
[05:05.63]That's all I had.
[05:06.27]That's I just did that kind of I didn't have anything really.
[05:09.25]Alright, let's see if the boys are ready as ready.
[05:40.19]below ring calling ring is anybody there hey how are you hey there buckaroo hey if you haven't you've you've grown who me yeah man time sure flies you've grown a lot since I last saw you
[06:02.31]know trying to do better every day right uh don't open this game if by the way please for the love of god do not open this game if you have your volume up it's one of those games it's a video game I know it's not it's a video game and it does a slashing like explosive like wild slash sound when you open it up and it's like deliberately it almost feels like it's deliberate
[06:28.82]I love when a game intro screen flashbangs you.
[06:32.28]It just prepares you for what's to come.
[06:35.07]Why do people do this?
[06:36.67]Are you awake?
[06:38.03]Remember when Elden Ring had the white screen and it was just this bright white screen?
[06:41.87]That was fun.
[06:44.26]I just like the first thing that people when you double click on something or if you open up a game I just like hey let's the first thing that should happen is doesn't matter what the volume is like let's say they were listening to music or something hey just to make the loudest the absolute loudest sound we have in the file system and have that play yeah pretty much
[07:07.54]Yo.
[07:07.70]Thank you so much.
[07:08.52]I...
[07:23.60]I admittedly have been doing, I did the joke about the Tom Hanks voice once or twice.
[07:28.68]I woke up and my voice was a little froggy and I kept walking around the house going, get the camera!
[07:33.30]I'm Tom Hanks!
[07:34.84]I didn't sound anything like him.
[07:36.82]Wasn't even close.
[07:39.00]Oh my God.
[07:39.58]But you've definitely influenced my life.
[07:42.61]Yeah, you have too.
[07:43.45]I've been thinking about Tom Hanks voice.
[07:45.39]So good job.
[07:46.15]Okay.
[07:46.85]Alright.
[07:48.29]Hey, I'm just trying to do my best.

[08:06.88]Good.
[08:08.24]I'm ready to do this thing, but where do we do this?
[08:10.60]Unranked?
[08:13.07]I think we just go to unranked and then somebody first.
[08:15.67]I'll invite you guys to a lotto.
[08:17.79]You guys make your worm team?
[08:20.29]Yeah.
[08:21.12]No, I did.
[08:22.88]I got one.
[08:23.38]I got a good one.
[08:26.38]Yo, hold on.
[08:26.82]I had a bug with worms last time and it's happening again with the resolution.
[08:30.17]You guys ever have that?
[08:31.75]Yep.
[08:32.22]Hey, alright.
[08:33.04]Let me save you.
[08:33.66]Let me save you like 30 minutes of time here.
[08:36.66]Okay, please.
[08:37.58]You are going to go.
[08:39.06]You're going to go to the EXE file.
[08:41.14]The Worms WMD EXE file.
[08:44.82]It should be in Steam, Steam apps, you know, that whole area.
[08:47.53]I'm in there.
[08:48.13]I'm in there.
[08:48.83]Right click the EXE.
[08:51.41]Go to properties.
[08:52.69]And then go to compatibility.
[08:53.79]Yep.
[08:54.67]And then you're looking for the thing that says like DPI, like exclusions or something about like advanced DPI kind of settings.
[09:01.46]Yeah, I'm there.
[09:02.12]Okay, go there.
[09:03.02]And there should be two checkboxes, right?
[09:04.74]There's one at the top, one at the bottom.
[09:05.80]It's like, oh, use the application to do the scaling, right?
[09:08.88]Oh, override.
[09:09.76]Yeah, override.
[09:10.20]And it should say application, right?
[09:12.18]Yeah.
[09:12.59]Check that box.
[09:13.25]Make sure it's application.
[09:14.63]Hit accept.
[09:15.55]You're good.

[09:30.61]I'm glad to save you some trouble there.
[09:34.03]No, that shit broke my shit last year.
[09:36.25]I remember.
[09:36.59]Well, how are you guys doing?
[09:43.81]How are the four horsemen?
[09:45.21]That's like what we're calling ourselves, right?
[09:47.51]Yeah.
[09:48.93]Which horsemen are you?
[09:50.77]We had to figure that out before we started.
[09:53.21]We have to?
[09:55.39]I didn't.
[09:59.09]What's the name of the horseman?
[10:01.15]Pestilence, famine, war, and death.
[10:05.80]Who's who?
[10:07.06]I'll be death.
[10:08.06]Okay.
[10:09.60]I eat.
[10:11.20]Like, I eat, so I don't think I could be famine.
[10:16.08]Flatulence?
[10:16.62]I'll be flatulence.
[10:17.94]You want to be flatulence?
[10:18.90]Okay.
[10:20.84]Yeah, no, I'm death.
[10:22.56]No, Ster, you are war.
[10:23.70]No, I'm death.
[10:24.87]Well, okay, because, no, I'm death.
[10:29.66]I have a claim we're gonna find out Ster has a dark past alright who's making the game jersey short did anybody anybody do the tutorial well I'm making my team real quick yeah you gotta make the team you have to make a team give me one second I'll host the game I'll invite oh actually yeah I gotta do that
[10:52.63]I thought I did this already.
[10:53.68]Okay, so you're not ready.
[10:54.50]You're not ready.
[10:55.10]I thought I did it already.
[10:56.00]I thought I did it already.
[10:56.94]Boy, I thought I did it.
[10:58.38]How do you think that you did it?
[10:59.82]Because I did.
[11:00.48]When?
[11:01.72]I just didn't save it, apparently.
[11:05.76]Ster, do we have each other on Steam?
[11:08.36]Uh, you blocked me.
[11:11.27]Oh, there it is.
[11:12.15]To be fair.
[11:12.91]Big move.
[11:13.41]To be fair, you were saying weird shit about, like, you know, Jersey Shore, what you did.
[11:18.29]You said you were into diapers, and then you blocked me.
[11:23.26]I mean I've been trying to find diaper games myself chat was recommending one to me I don't it's one of those ancient 2005 like tuber bait games where you like it's a dad running around the house trying to prevent his babies from playing themselves yeah I feel like that that doesn't fly these days I don't know I what are the rules
[11:48.54]I think if there's a diaper in the game, we can play it.
[11:52.62]By the way, I think we should all turn our sounds down because someone's going to throw a grenade and it's going to blow us all up in our rooms and shit in real life.
[11:59.46]It's going to be so loud.
[12:00.92]It's going to be the loudest sound ever.
[12:07.13]When I played Worms when I was younger, I had all the weapons, like the holy grenade, stuff like that.
[12:13.13]But when I play now... What the fuck just happened?
[12:21.10]I can't even hear them talking anymore.
[12:22.40]What the hell just happened?
[12:36.31]Give me one sec.
[13:08.55]Otherwise, we're just going to either become best friends or like rivals.
[13:13.83]What's wrong?
[13:15.85]You are balancing us out.
[13:18.61]Okay, and how so?
[13:19.77]So that we do not become too powerful.
[13:21.77]I don't... Hold on, I'm trying to invite people.
[13:26.82]Vinny, it says you're offline, so I can't invite you.
[13:29.78]I went on.

[15:23.60]Why?
[15:23.94]No, look, Ster already.

[16:06.59]Oh, okay.

[18:49.10]Go away.
[18:51.54]A shotgun to the face is worth less damage than being punched.
[18:57.01]Oh, wait.
[18:57.21]I'm still going.

[20:52.53]Ster I just got gifted on Steam three diaper games like diaper quest 2055 so I'll be in touch real soon about that okay yeah I'm I'm excited to to learn more um yeah I I'm out here yeah do we like the drill just can't you make like a little bunker I had a drill and I accidentally cancelled it you but you have more though no
[21:22.05]Yeah, there you go.
[21:25.63]That's cheating.
[21:27.69]You get there, buddy.
[21:30.11]Two more turns.
[21:32.06]Oh, it's like watching paint dry.
[21:34.60]The good news about being in that spot is the rest of us can attack each other and you can just, you know.
[21:41.80]I'm just sitting back.
[21:44.47]Also, Poke, I realized I killed your worm and not Jerma's.
[21:48.41]Yeah.
[21:48.73]I thought Jeremy was Jerma's.
[21:50.91]Oh, my God.
[21:53.13]It's a pretty good tactic.
[21:55.73]Oh, look at this stack.
[21:56.75]Why are you guys stacked?
[21:59.91]Don't do it.
[22:02.55]We are stacked.
[22:03.19]This is bad.
[22:09.60]Oh, nice.
[22:12.34]This guy's been practicing.
[22:13.78]Yeah.
[22:14.32]Not so much.
[22:14.78]We don't know the buttons.
[22:22.53]This guy's been practicing.
[22:23.89]This guy, man.
[22:28.27]Nice.
[22:28.67]That was a good finish.
[22:31.11]Peewee Worm Man, also very underrated name.
[22:35.48]Thank you.
[22:37.58]One of the all time names.
[22:48.14]No.
[22:49.42]Alright, folk, what's your plan here?
[22:51.43]It's you.
[22:53.70]No, I said that to make myself seem more friendly.
[22:57.80]So you would maybe go somewhere else.
[23:01.93]I'm just trying to live.
[23:06.11]Don't kill Summit, please.
[23:10.65]Yeah, your timer's counting down.
[23:13.33]I thought it was his turn.
[23:14.59]I thought it was Poke's turn.
[23:15.95]He told you.
[23:17.15]And you said, yeah, I know.
[23:17.99]It's your turn.
[23:20.16]I shoot myself with the shotgun what just happened okay I I was look I was looking over a chat and I looked back and I and I thought because it was like oh we're stacked up here oh my god I really thought it was practicing I'm learning from one of my mods oh what is the most damage uh you could baseball bat him into the into the bomb over there okay
[23:44.95]walk up on them this is just a warm-up round this is where is it hey can you zoom in further like I want to say I want to I want to get close what's this whoa how did I uh mouse wheel this is not that close that's bad actually actually oh go get the med kit
[24:19.13]no don't do that that's really far oh god that is insane oh no oh shit okay we're learning the rules nine I don't think my worm had it like that okay okay now that you got the tutorial
[24:49.09]My publicist says it's only a matter of time.
[24:52.33]I thought none of those hit you at all.
[24:55.78]I was like, holy shit.
[25:02.10]11?
[25:02.36]Oh.
[25:06.25]Did you choose those names or is it default?
[25:08.79]Peewee Wurman is not a default name.
[25:11.77]I would sue.

[28:55.46]I think it's a jackhammer.
[28:58.40]Yeah, that's one.
[28:59.40]The blowtorch is another one.
[29:00.54]Time's running out.
[29:09.53]Can you craft in this game?
[29:11.45]Wasn't this one where you get materials and you can craft new weapons?
[29:15.75]what like if you get if you get enough like berries you can make the the thing that heals your horse yes I think they drop crates of weapons I I don't know about crafting weapons yeah my chat's saying that that's Minecraft no it's there's
[29:32.87]there's like um materials that drop once in a while from the sky and you can use them isn't there like a worms 3d game where it's like a crafting has a shooter or something isn't it like a shooter like a worm shooter that came out my chat was saying it was like a battle royale oh my goodness hey I live here hey hey
[30:04.23]Uh-oh.
[30:06.89]No!
[30:07.07]50 damage.
[30:10.41]45.
[30:11.17]Dammit.
[30:14.43]There's a crafting game mode, but you turned it off, sir, apparently.
[30:18.73]Oh, my bad.
[30:19.69]Yeah, it's okay.
[30:20.80]I put it on Classic.
[30:21.82]There was ESL, like Pro League.
[30:25.48]There was too many choices.
[30:28.44]I didn't think we were ready for the competitive circuit.
[30:35.61]no don't do it the worms 3d shooter for the GameCube is the experience the only one I've had with this whole franchise I didn't even know it was 2d until last year wow that's that's your demographic oh god no no no get up there oh
[31:04.50]You got to do something.
[31:05.80]Oh, that's not good for all of us.
[31:11.58]Oh, sorry.
[31:12.92]One.

[31:24.13]Oh, now I see them.
[31:25.11]Yeah, there were balls.
[31:25.91]Now they're like lumpy balls.
[31:27.17]Okay.
[31:28.65]I need... I got an idea here.
[31:31.55]If I can figure out the rope.
[31:36.06]I think oh I'm in so much trouble you're good luck what do you mean good luck this is my one of my only the only play I got is like this who's chucking me tools about three
[32:04.14]What?
[32:04.78]Free damage?
[32:05.68]That's it?
[32:06.84]That weapon is so talk shit.
[32:09.61]Let's go, Summit!
[32:11.59]They're full of confetti?
[32:12.59]What's even in it?
[32:17.51]Balls.
[32:20.84]Some dramatic thunder on this stage.
[32:23.94]Zombie grenade.
[32:30.96]because I do remember your worms would normally start with like no items I mean you would have to craft it it's coming back to me yeah or like spend money to buy items and or like collect them you have like a shotgun like like one another thing you know oh geez yeah that's gonna suck that's gonna that's gonna be horrendous oh my god he actually might be alive still I think he might be alright at least the red one oh barely yeah damn
[33:03.33]Let's go.
[33:04.85]I fucking hate these turns.
[33:08.14]I want to play the game.
[33:10.62]You got to Shawshank this.
[33:11.72]You'll get there.
[33:14.48]You guys want to do teams next time?
[33:15.74]Like 2v2?
[33:17.10]Yeah, you could do the forts too where you both start on your own fort.
[33:20.98]How do I just end my turn?
[33:24.65]I think there's like a flag.
[33:26.21]There you go.
[33:28.33]Turn's over.
[33:30.25]It's like a jump rope or a flag or something, right?
[33:31.89]Oh, skip rope.
[33:32.59]Yeah, jump rope.
[33:33.13]Uh, what up people?
[33:40.34]New weapons available, it said.
[33:44.46]Oh, they unlock via like turns.
[33:46.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:50.24]OK, how do we do this?
[33:51.02]What are we doing here?
[33:51.68]Yeah, just do that.
[33:58.27]Wrong button, wrong button.
[34:01.36]there's a way to launch yourself backwards back right so you can like bounce around and then it's harder twice good job Ben really nice work alright cool
[34:28.02]yeah yeah hey you didn't get hurt and you didn't lose your space okay what am I gonna do then you can walk through that building it's hollow it's bright time oh is it yeah they're saying it's it's it's walk throughable oh hollow one
[34:59.08]Vinny, why is your worm a zoomer?
[35:02.40]He's a streamer.
[35:03.66]Like me.
[35:05.42]Trust me when I say, I'm just fucking hiding.
[35:10.50]I trust you.
[35:11.48]Wait, is that your only worm right now, Jerm?
[35:14.30]How about you fucking all you eat shit?
[35:20.04]Oh, okay.
[35:24.80]I'm no noob.
[35:27.51]Isn't there like a switch worm ability?
[35:30.43]I think there is.
[35:30.99]Oh, he's got two.
[35:34.67]Yeah, I see.
[35:37.75]I think you can cycle between them.
[35:39.90]I think you need an item.
[35:45.94]301 view club.
[35:46.50]Yeah, they just made a reference from 10 years ago.
[35:48.86]That's pretty cool.
[35:55.44]Yeah, I'm saving my jet packs because I want to be able to run away.
[35:58.00]This is turning into a hide and seek game.
[36:03.01]Yeah, that is a turtle spot.
[36:08.93]Like for me or for you?
[36:12.74]For all of us, I guess.
[36:15.04]I suppose you'll have to decide.
[36:17.38]I could do anything.
[36:24.34]Hey, who is that aimed at?
[36:25.54]Who are you calling weird?
[36:27.80]The worm.
[36:29.90]He's a weird person.
[36:40.24]How have you have... I have so much health still.
[36:44.46]Oh, you have the cube over here, right?
[36:49.98]I don't...
[36:52.94]Are you going to airstrike one guy?
[36:54.71]You're going to miss.
[36:59.05]You're the most vulnerable guy.
[37:08.39]In the top left corner.
[37:09.49]Jerma will remember that.
[37:13.82]Just popped up in the top left corner.
[37:15.48]Diaper.
[37:21.08]okay okay what are we doing here I'll add this to my real roping series god I hate why do I keep doing the rope I hate it it's so bad I know it's but it's so addicting he said the rope is bad my fans will start like it's good we just need to get him
[37:48.11]What an awful item, man!
[37:55.16]My worm said he was losing subscribers and then he... ...blunk himself into the ocean.
[38:00.40]Alright, what's wrong with my guy?
[38:03.78]Wait, what?
[38:04.80]Oh, shit!

[38:08.19]He's at the bottom.
[38:08.89]Bottom in the hole.
[38:09.51]Yeah, but why?
[38:10.41]It keeps on, like, ripping up here.
[38:11.65]That was weird.
[38:12.71]I don't know.
[38:13.01]You have a grenade in your hand with one HP.
[38:14.91]Be careful.
[38:17.39]That was weird.
[38:17.83]That was weird controls.
[38:18.85]Alright, where's my jetpack?
[38:23.25]You can automatically jetpack if you press space.
[38:25.86]Wait, what?
[38:26.34]Really?
[38:26.64]This is going to be a panic.
[38:28.96]No.

[38:53.24]This is your new home.
[38:54.42]You're inside the bong.
[38:55.53]In the top left corner.
[38:56.23]Oh, that's not going to work.
[38:57.05]Jerma was offended by that comment.
[39:03.87]I fucking hate using third person.
[39:05.27]I'm never doing it again.
[39:06.09]I promise.
[39:06.59]I'm so sorry.
[39:11.73]We thought you were talking to your chat, so it's all good.

[41:10.66]I'm just gonna quit the game.
[41:11.66]Dude, I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[41:14.30]The universe is getting in the way of every fucking button I press.
[41:17.60]What the fuck?
[41:21.19]Okay, when you use the jetpack, you don't have to hold space.
[41:23.43]You just tap space.
[41:25.55]Or you can use arrow.
[41:27.51]W, A, S, D. Yeah, W, yeah.
[41:29.37]Okay.
[41:30.01]Because I was holding space and I used them all up.
[41:41.91]This is going to be fun to watch.
[41:44.97]Oh, he's bananing.
[41:47.15]Oh, no, don't go.
[41:48.11]Oh, God, it's coming into my shack.

[41:56.74]Holy shit.
[41:58.16]Banana's big mode.

[42:04.52]Yeah, somehow.
[42:05.52]Oh, my God.
[42:06.98]I'm ready.
[42:09.05]What are you going to do, sir?
[42:15.68]I don't.
[42:17.78]What is happening?
[42:18.82]I'm trying to switch worm.
[42:19.94]I used it twice and it's tab tab.
[42:22.80]They just ran just the most random buttons.
[42:27.67]Yeah, they need better buttons for the sequel to this one that happens.
[42:31.39]OK, without looking, are there more worms games than Jason movies?
[42:38.13]Yeah, you think so?
[42:38.97]I'm going to say no.
[42:44.10]Oh, I thought you meant Jason Bourne.
[42:46.16]The Bourne ultimatum.
[42:50.08]I should do a Jason V. Jason.
[42:56.68]Um... I smiled.
[42:58.98]How do you... How do you switch the, um, angle?
[43:04.88]Chat?
[43:06.04]Uh, that's a good question.
[43:07.12]It's probably, it's probably, like, six on your keyboard.
[43:10.60]Someone said tab.
[43:12.12]Oh, thank you.
[43:12.70]Alright, cool.
[43:14.77]yeah Ster I gotta I gotta do this buddy not my guy purple light that's like the only move I have from this point forward so is that your last guy yeah one HP who is even here he's like he can't die because he's like he's like clinging on to life but he's poisoned and suffering
[43:46.05]I am in a lot of trouble and I think I'm just going to have to go for this.
[43:52.04]It's a blowtorch to hide, right?
[43:54.08]Yeah, press space one time.
[44:00.56]I just have to hide.
[44:05.02]And then what's the digging one?
[44:08.20]You'll regret that.
[44:13.67]Everyone's calling me a coward.
[44:14.69]I have one health.
[44:16.75]Guys, I'm going to land.
[44:17.59]I'm going to take fall damage jumping and die.
[44:20.95]The way your turns have been going.
[44:22.07]I'm surprised you didn't kill yourself with the blowtorch.
[44:31.22]This is game one.
[44:32.68]Purple light must go down.
[44:42.79]Leave him out of this!
[44:47.76]He's about 25- I'll get you!
[44:50.18]Bye-bye!
[44:56.04]Yeah guys, I guess if everyone takes a turn shooting at purple light, so do I just end Vinny?
[45:01.84]Star, I- Listen.
[45:04.46]I don't got much going on right now in my life, so if you could just let me have this poisoned worm, I would be so happy.
[45:11.48]Wait, why isn't it aiming up or down?
[45:17.17]Can it only go?
[45:18.51]Oh, no!
[45:23.39]You got me!
[45:25.03]Holy shit!
[45:25.90]You got me!
[45:28.38]Got him!
[45:28.58]Calculate it!
[45:29.10]What the fuck?
[45:30.46]Got two!
[45:32.24]Poke takes the lead!
[45:33.52]Chicken!
[45:36.36]I wonder what I'm gonna do.
[45:42.11]You know what?
[45:42.55]Hold on a second.
[45:43.23]Do I have any... Sheep on a rope?
[45:47.17]Wait, hold on.
[45:47.93]Can I just like... GG, dude.
[45:53.16]Don't say these things and you don't know the outcomes yet.
[45:59.68]Dude wants to go get a snack.
[46:04.64]A hummus snack.
[46:06.12]Sounds pretty great.
[46:07.40]I still haven't had the hummus.
[46:08.52]I was gonna get it.
[46:09.26]I gotta get it.
[46:10.24]I think I'm just going full coward mode.
[46:13.16]I think that makes sense to me.
[46:15.54]I only have 7 seconds.
[46:17.50]Alright, have fun guys.
[46:22.92]I'll be watching.
[46:24.18]I'll be watching from here.
[46:25.02]He doesn't know.
[46:26.95]I don't think he knows.
[46:28.31]Let's just not say anything.
[46:29.65]It's fine.
[46:32.43]The water rises?
[46:33.25]Yeah.
[46:33.61]It's not going to rise enough to kill me I don't think right now, will it?
[46:43.58]We're good.
[46:49.18]Another grandma.
[46:52.74]It's the arrow keys to aim up and down, right?
[46:55.60]Yeah.
[46:57.24]Weird, I know you could.
[46:58.38]The other person threw the banana up.
[46:59.88]I couldn't aim up or down.
[47:07.61]What is this?
[47:11.13]Oh, teleport OK.
[47:13.60]he's got the high ground I've got the high ground Watto don't make me use my force powers on you I you know why you guys don't need to be exposed to this the water is fine I'm in a good spot
[47:44.05]He's in a very good spot.
[47:45.97]It'll be fine.
[47:46.93]So, Ster, you're not holding down space.
[47:49.45]You just pat it.
[47:50.63]Okay.
[48:00.74]What is this reconnaissance mission bullshit?
[48:02.32]You're not coming down here, are you?
[48:07.75]No.
[48:10.77]Really?
[48:12.39]Shit.
[48:12.57]I wanted you to bounce down.
[48:21.72]Getting there, but hey, look at that.
[48:23.66]I want a mission now.
[48:29.40]Okay.
[48:29.87]Let me get this good to go.
[48:31.43]The water is exposed.
[48:33.15]It is.
[48:33.67]Alright.
[48:34.51]Where's that?
[48:34.85]I don't have any more jet pack, but I do have a rope.
[48:38.22]with it no I don't I don't have anything alright I do have a teleport it's true man I should have used one of those damn that that ends your turn it does end the turn
[49:02.75]It's okay.
[49:06.29]I gotta get up here.
[49:07.21]I was thinking about going there, but I wanted the health.
[49:10.24]I think I threw.
[49:15.80]What the fuck was that?
[49:17.64]Oh my god.
[49:18.42]What?
[49:18.94]How did you do that?
[49:20.32]Remember me?
[49:24.16]You combine two moves at once?
[49:26.00]Whoa.
[49:34.23]It was crazy.
[49:39.51]No.
[49:40.49]Oh, God.
[49:42.25]You're so good.
[49:43.81]I did the same thing you did.
[49:45.33]Your poisoned, diseased worm was ready to get out of the hole.
[49:51.16]The hole that I could not.
[49:52.22]Oh, my God.
[49:55.70]What just happened?
[50:01.64]oh yes exactly part of my plan who put it there?
[50:05.86]they just random spawn I put it there in my head hey poke I know your plan was to come kill me by dropping something on me here but hey let's uh when you get there wherever you're going go ahead and send me a postcard motherfucker that's gonna miss
[50:31.44]I can't fucking believe it.
[50:38.33]I can't believe it.
[50:45.35]That was embarrassing.
[50:46.41]Yeah.
[50:48.00]I thought I had it lined up.
[50:49.50]I would have hit the side of the... I was going to hit the edge.
[50:54.41]I'm a weird person.
[50:55.41]Sorry.
[50:56.13]Cartoon villain.
[50:57.87]I have been a cartoon villain the whole time.
[50:59.45]I'm essentially like every Looney Tunes bad guy combined in this game.
[51:04.65]I haven't done anything.
[51:05.75]I literally been watching you guys play and like bumping my head into walls and like walking into the screen door and stuff.
[51:14.87]I'm out of here.
[51:22.15]yeah this is just like this has been Ster vs poke the whole time are you kidding are you kidding are you fucking doing jokes at least at least he's missing a lot of shit too right like I'm okay I feel alright I was gonna fraud it's a practice match let's go for the hadouken it's the bumble practice match we're bumbling it's all good I don't like classic mode we get like no options
[51:51.35]the basic stuff what is the worms theme song we should play with all stuff unlocked yeah all stuff unlocked no water no hiding places no no water we'll do yeah we'll do forts too it'll be it'll be cool like a fort we'll have like a fortnight oh dude if that was summit 1g you would have had me
[52:21.23]Who wins this?
[52:22.01]I actually don't know who's going to win this.
[52:24.66]It's going to come down to right now.
[52:33.14]Damn.
[52:34.14]Oh, man.
[52:34.80]Careful.
[52:35.16]I'm thinking.
[52:42.63]No.
[52:47.48]Don't do it.
[52:50.06]Oh no, that's not going to be enough.
[53:02.06]How much damage is that?
[53:10.41]That was a good first match.
[53:13.57]It's not over yet, Buster.
[53:15.57]Yeah, it's about to be.
[53:23.89]Like they're both in like weird spots to attack each other.
[53:31.25]Oh, worms can't aim down.
[53:36.81]Kicked.
[53:48.83]Really good placement, actually.
[53:50.41]That was great.
[53:51.73]Yeah.
[53:54.13]Just kind of digs him out a little bit.
[53:58.55]Oh, come on.
[54:01.03]What?
[54:01.51]Okay.
[54:01.81]Probably nothing in it.
[54:03.68]Okay.
[54:04.04]This is do or die.
[54:16.58]What a match, folks.
[54:17.38]What a match.
[54:18.78]Is anyone's game still?
[54:22.33]What was it?
[54:23.21]Reveal it.
[54:25.78]um I don't know it wasn't useful take one no not summit yes I'm so glad that I'm not the only cartoon villain in the group I'm so happy about it it has a lock on I didn't think I also had to shoot it I just pressed space so it would shoot
[54:54.64]Like, I locked on, you know?
[54:56.96]Somebody said that was a dud.
[55:00.16]Yeah, you fired off a fucking empty rocket plane.
[55:02.76]I gave this guy the fucking tutorial.
[55:05.53]Yeah, you just tap space.
[55:08.99]The wind.
[55:10.67]There's a shitload of wind, yeah.
[55:12.01]Oh, shit.
[55:14.81]The match continues.
[55:15.77]You missed.
[55:21.41]A dud.
[55:22.62]Ready?
[55:26.48]Who here is familiar with the Metal Gear Solid franchise?
[55:28.70]I am.
[55:31.95]Cool.
[55:33.43]I don't have anything left.
[55:38.55]Which ones do you like, Jerm?
[55:39.91]What's your favorite?
[55:41.67]I like one and three.
[55:44.87]Those are mine too, yeah.
[55:47.48]And not in any particular order.
[55:51.36]Okay, because mine is one, three, then two.
[55:53.88]Those are my three favorites in order.
[55:57.32]does rising count rising's great oh rising is good that's right I'm just trying to small talk I'm not trying to expose them to terrible bits this is a Metal Gear bit no he's not not this time I'm just curious because someone said a dud so mgs2 yeah
[56:19.79]The only reason why 2 is not, you know, up there with the same category as 1 and 3 was... Is 2 the one that has, like, 30 hours of cutscenes in it?
[56:32.06]Pretty much.
[56:33.34]I mean, that's most of them.
[56:34.60]Yeah, the most.
[56:35.14]I remember 2 had a lot, though.
[56:39.45]4 had the most.
[56:40.35]That's Guns of the Patriots, right?
[56:42.59]Yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of.
[56:45.05]I didn't know it does that.
[56:46.51]4 was a movie.
[56:47.01]Yeah, okay.
[56:47.43]I'm thinking of 4.
[56:49.08]that's a good plan for me getting off that dang high ground oh turns out you sitting on that little lip was the best spot you could have picked I just win by doing nothing hopefully if Ster hit the lock on missile that would have been that would have been pretty good I can't even like throw out of here
[57:19.07]Yeah, you're in a weird spot.
[57:23.17]M. How did you rotate this?
[57:26.71]So apparently... Chat, what was it?
[57:29.64]Don't press anything yet.
[57:31.62]Z. Tab.
[57:34.82]It was tab.
[57:36.94]Wasn't there a weird Metal Gear, like, wave shooter game or something that came out?
[57:43.33]Did I dream of this?
[57:45.97]Metal Gear Survive.
[57:47.67]Okay, yep.
[57:50.65]Some people really like that game.
[57:51.75]They say it's a lot of fun, but I never played it.
[57:53.81]It had zombies in it?
[57:58.08]It was like zombies, yeah.
[58:00.54]What do I do?
[58:05.36]Got any grenades left or any bazookas?
[58:09.38]Ooh.
[58:09.70]Okay.
[58:11.28]Ooh, good recovery.
[58:12.49]I don't need that.
[58:15.59]I got worm select.
[58:18.27]You should switch.
[58:22.06]Closing the gap a little here.
[58:30.96]Oh, and that's going to be a GG.
[58:32.79]Oh wow.
[58:36.59]Look at that.
[58:42.69]I see.
[58:47.14]I see.
[58:58.10]This won't work on me.
[58:59.08]Uh-oh.
[58:59.30]Wait, what?
[59:02.05]Uh-oh.
[59:02.71]Where did you get that?
[59:03.57]No!
[59:03.63]It hit my leg!
[59:06.73]Oh, it's going to bounce back and kill you.
[59:10.07]The tiny little point.
[59:12.39]That's crazy.
[59:15.00]The defense.
[59:16.68]You never know what's going to happen in a game.
[59:21.92]Sir, how hungry are you?
[59:25.06]He's pretty hungry.
[59:27.88]Here's a banana.
[59:29.62]He's got the banana.
[59:31.29]Banana bomb.
[59:34.67]No way.
[59:35.43]Maybe, maybe.
[59:38.07]Oh, it's not enough, I don't think.
[59:39.53]Oh my gosh.
[59:40.85]Oh no.
[59:41.73]This is insane, this match.
[59:46.08]Not for the banana bros, that's right.
[59:59.87]You were on like one pixel start.
[60:01.47]Yeah, I know.
[60:02.15]I know.
[60:02.79]I throw a grenade and it'll hit that.
[60:04.93]Yeah.
[60:13.34]Running out the shot clock.
[60:15.58]Oh, OK.
[60:15.78]I think that's the way it is.
[60:25.08]It's a Dom Strats.
[60:27.86]Yep.
[60:30.69]Uh-oh.
[60:56.33]Wait.
[60:57.49]Oh, she farted right here.
[60:58.49]No!
[60:58.59]Oh, wait.
[60:58.83]Wait, what?
[60:59.17]What?
[60:59.73]What?
[60:59.99]I couldn't have predicted that.
[61:11.30]No one wins.
[61:12.36]That's a good warm-up game, I guess.
[61:14.46]Good warm-up round.
[61:15.52]Let's go.
[61:17.20]What?
[61:19.20]Nah, I'm done playing.
[61:22.31]I'm done playing.
[61:26.03]133 damage.
[61:30.25]I didn't even get a Mario Party star at the end of the game either.
[61:33.85]That's sad.
[61:37.01]Fuck those stars.
[61:39.19]imagine doing nothing all game and then winning because of stars at the end I hated that you can't change your team in here you have to make a new thing or something you should put you should put every unlock hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna re-invite you guys to a lobby okay you quit the whole game no I didn't can you uh well you couldn't change the settings from in there
[62:08.53]It was being weird.
[62:09.89]Okay.
[62:15.32]I am ready for an invite.
[62:19.12]Okay.
[62:21.20]That was a good warm up.
[62:22.16]I think we're ready to go.
[62:22.96]I think we understand the game.
[62:24.56]So we can do Fort 2v2.
[62:27.74]I think.
[62:34.89]Yeah, I'm good for Fort.
[62:36.90]Are we doing 2v2 or free-for-all again?
[62:40.03]Up to you guys.
[62:43.47]I'm looking at what my options are.
[62:44.73]It gives you schemes, but I don't know if any of these have, like, does chat know if any of these have everything unlocked?
[62:53.19]Oh, you can go into more details.
[62:59.34]So you want to give us everything, okay.
[63:01.80]That's what Poke is saying, and you know what?
[63:03.90]Maybe I'm wrong.
[63:05.58]No, I'm cool with that.
[63:06.80]I think that's fun.
[63:08.94]We'll see how chaotic it is.
[63:12.26]I can turn crafting on.
[63:13.92]I really don't know how it works.
[63:27.89]I think what you can do is just have more weapon drops.
[63:37.34]I can set weapon drops to 100%.
[63:38.48]That sounds good.
[63:39.30]I think that'll solve a lot of stuff as long as I make every weapon appearable in crates and then craftings on, however that works.
[63:51.83]And then we could scale up.
[63:53.49]You don't want to go to 100 right away.
[63:56.00]Alright, so we are different colors this time.
[63:59.14]Yeah.
[64:00.18]Are we okay with the colors here?
[64:01.92]Mm-hmm.
[64:09.52]Yep.
[64:09.78]Colors.
[64:10.36]Colors are good.
[64:11.48]I'm just ready up.
[64:15.48]Fort map with full warmage scheme.
[64:17.95]What's full warmage?
[64:21.49]Oh, class.
[64:22.17]I see.
[64:24.57]What team do you guys want to be on?
[64:26.01]What's the deal?
[64:27.11]Alright.
[64:27.33]So how are we going to do this?
[64:28.35]Do you want to do teams?
[64:30.43]I am thinking.
[64:31.13]Me and Vinny.
[64:33.19]Okay.
[64:34.21]Sure.
[64:34.93]Okay.
[64:37.11]Alright.
[64:37.35]Ster up for us both on blue.
[64:41.14]Time to take your kid to work day.
[64:42.74]Hope you're ready to play.
[64:44.06]Oh, hold on.
[64:46.30]What was I going to say?
[64:53.95]Oh, someone in my chat said for scheme, go full warmage.
[64:59.71]I did a custom one.
[65:01.11]Okay, sorry.
[65:03.99]I just want to see how do you turn it on onto forts?
[65:09.77]Oh, there's a whole fort setting.
[65:14.53]Don't belittle yourself.
[65:15.37]You're a seasoned gamer.
[65:19.05]Weird gaming.
[65:24.23]Oh, I think the vehicles suck.
[65:27.51]There's like vehicles that you can get in the game.
[65:29.03]They're not good.
[65:30.91]Really?
[65:32.60]That seems weird for a worms game.
[65:37.00]I think, yeah, there's like a helicopter.
[65:42.64]I'm not messing around this time.
[65:43.82]I'm ready to lock in.
[65:47.12]Okay, it's a poke and Vinny.
[65:50.01]He chose favorites and me.
[65:52.43]Oh, yeah, I see why you didn't want to pick fucking Jerma.
[65:56.45]What do you mean?
[65:59.17]I mean, you know what I mean?
[66:01.81]Don't say it.
[66:03.11]Don't say it.
[66:03.91]We're all here.
[66:04.59]Say it.
[66:07.31]what you know what we all had our Looney Tunes moments last game I think I'm even worse learning experience and and I'm ready for some more I did worse than Jerma poke so you've chosen somewhat poorly but I'll I'll make you proud dad I just want to see stern I just want to see stern Jerma argue that's why I put them together
[66:32.08]That's not gonna happen.
[66:34.46]Here I am thinking, wow, Paul really likes me.
[66:36.62]That's awesome.
[66:37.20]I mean, as long... I love Vinny.
[66:39.91]But as long as... I mean, it's not gonna happen.
[66:41.47]As long as he's not a fucking idiot.
[66:43.21]Like, you know, that's... Like, normally, we'll be fine.
[66:46.05]Alright, Stuart, where are we going?
[66:47.68]What do you want me to do?
[66:48.76]What's the plan here?
[66:50.47]The plan is I need to make sure this might still be the same equipment.
[66:55.54]Can you craft?
[66:56.32]I got a grown-ass man right next to me.
[66:58.28]See if I can handle it.
[66:59.36]Oh, wait.
[67:00.70]Okay, hold on a second.
[67:01.60]No, this is you.
[67:02.08]Yeah, the crafting is available.
[67:03.91]Wait, are we controlling the same?
[67:06.43]We're on the same team.
[67:07.93]So you are in control, I think, right now.
[67:10.97]Yeah, you are.
[67:12.63]Who's blue?
[67:14.93]And we share worms.
[67:16.97]Yeah, you share worms.
[67:18.43]You're highlighted right now.
[67:20.80]Uh oh, dude.
[67:25.78]And yeah, I think it reset all my worm names.
[67:29.52]Yeah, my worm, I had a worm called Sadam.
[67:31.91]I can't even get him.
[67:33.15]I'm really upset about that.
[67:34.29]Wait, is that me?
[67:35.87]Can you use the tunnel thing?
[67:38.30]Yeah, Polk.
[67:38.98]My chat was talking about how you were learning about the Saddam meme in real time.
[67:44.78]Name is at the... Yeah, I found out.
[67:48.32]I'm all goofed.
[67:49.38]Sir, you didn't even play.
[67:51.60]We're giving them first turn because they're at a disadvantage.
[67:56.16]Okay.
[67:56.54]Alright.
[67:59.00]How do I... Okay, I see, I see, I see.
[68:03.48]Alright, alright.
[68:06.07]um where's the infinite items I don't think we have that yeah yeah I think I might need to reset I think why did I do that oh oh god yeah so you want to reset no no no resetting
[68:22.46]I think I made a whole scheme and saved it, but it stayed on classic.
[68:26.92]Okay, so yeah, maybe we try.
[68:29.28]But also, there's a weapon spawning every single turn, so it might be the right one.
[68:32.98]Because I just put all the weapons on in crates.
[68:35.08]Okay, so how do you switch warms?
[68:38.68]How do you switch warms?
[68:39.58]How do you switch warms?
[68:41.10]There's a rotation, like a refresh.
[68:43.19]Okay.
[68:44.29]I am going to do this.
[68:45.19]Okay, here's what I'm doing.
[68:51.01]Infinite of every item would just be boring because you'd use every one.
[68:54.78]You good?
[68:56.68]The one cool guy.
[68:57.74]That's a cool worm and it makes me very upset that I'm about to do this.
[69:02.58]Do you see the feet you're on right now?
[69:03.96]Do you see the toes?
[69:07.88]That foot is swollen.
[69:12.10]Into the water.
[69:12.70]Hey!
[69:13.18]Actually, that was a Shoryuken.
[69:22.80]I was going to scream it, but I decided not to at the last second.
[69:25.74]You should have.
[69:27.86]I was going to do like the guttural deep jump.
[69:32.15]That one.
[69:34.25]I'm too nervous to get loud.
[69:36.53]You would be hurt for like a month if you did that.
[69:39.55]Don't do that.
[69:41.49]We need you healthy.
[69:42.78]Yeah, okay.

[70:21.71]No!
[70:24.25]Oh, what a weird person.
[70:30.76]Are worms bugs?
[70:32.46]I don't think so.
[70:33.26]I guess maybe bug adjacent.
[70:36.60]OK, let's use a new color.
[70:38.86]Yeah, what are worms?
[70:39.76]There is one green on this whole island.
[70:45.12]well get rid of them so then we have we have dominance over our our island trimps his bugs you don't think that that grown-ass man over there is gonna I think we probably do that grown-ass man over there is gonna sacrifice himself and take out this whole island we gotta get rid of him the girl has a worm by the way there's no bat yeah what we have less weapons don't spend time worrying
[71:14.64]I don't know how to drop this book.
[71:16.92]I don't know how to drop it with the thing.
[71:24.53]What happened birthday?
[71:27.37]It's not doing anything.
[71:28.23]You just leave.
[71:29.95]It doesn't do anything.
[71:34.32]If anything, you guys are now both on the edge.
[71:36.86]OK, I got I got a turn now.
[71:40.98]I gotta I gotta do this better than the last turn.
[71:42.98]Alright.
[71:45.06]Oh, God.
[71:46.66]Okay.
[71:50.62]I can't see you in there.
[71:52.28]Yeah.
[71:52.64]What are you saying?
[71:53.28]Like, you guys have some instructions coming out of the house.
[72:02.99]And I want us all through that.
[72:06.09]I am a big fan of your channel.
[72:08.05]I guess I live here now.
[72:10.53]My fans will start unsubscribing soon.
[72:13.77]Oh no.
[72:15.97]Maybe.
[72:16.29]Subscribe if you want to see more grenades.
[72:20.64]Subscribe if you want to see more grenades?
[72:24.74]What was that?
[72:26.88]You'd miss the floor with a sledge.
[72:30.46]Alright, I think I'm going to try something weird here.
[72:33.18]He said a bunch of boxes in our food poisoning.
[72:36.90]OK, let me see if I can make this happen here.
[72:39.10]It's it's going to be jet pack and then.
[72:42.84]So space with jet pack is just starts flying, right?
[72:45.80]Yeah, then you tap it while you're flying to keep yourself in the air.
[72:50.36]It's up arrow.
[72:51.50]Why give me bad info?
[72:54.70]Sorry.
[72:58.53]That was not correct.
[73:00.26]What?
[73:00.70]What?
[73:03.16]I was trying to drop it over you.
[73:04.40]I see the intent.
[73:06.28]Dude.
[73:06.96]What?
[73:08.56]Okay, so I pressed space floating over and it maybe stopped the jetpack, but it also dropped the... Okay.
[73:17.45]Yeah, it's been weird.
[73:18.73]I was confused by it earlier as well.
[73:22.61]I'm on your side.
[73:25.28]Not by choice, but we are literally on the same team.
[73:31.13]It's enter to drop an item from the jetpack.
[73:34.07]It's like, just weird controls.
[73:36.61]Like, seriously.
[73:43.70]Come on.
[73:44.06]Grab the edge!
[73:49.40]Oh no.
[73:56.11]I mean, if the controls were expected.
[74:00.51]Would it really be the same game?
[74:02.57]No, you have to.
[74:03.51]Yeah, you gotta fumble once in a while.
[74:05.29]I mean, I think that's the point that these games have the same control scheme since VR Draw Show.
[74:11.81]It's like 1995.
[74:12.75]It's been like this since like the 80s guys.
[74:16.47]We gotta we gotta figure it out.
[74:18.63]There is a chat member of mine that said they should add worms to the Olympics, but not like the game, just like real worms.
[74:23.46]I think it's a great idea.
[74:29.56]Do they compete?
[74:31.79]nothing just to hang it's like a bucket of worms take your time speed will come oh sure you can we have plenty of time is that the best I got wow if you learn anything it wasn't wasted time
[75:03.42]sternum I can't believe you would do something so brave let the record show I am not the one doing damage to ourselves this time it's just being near you I've got the debuff yeah yes yes I'm putting my hands out and I'm making energy go into you we are we gotta we gotta make up for a lot right now
[75:34.99]I don't know why it has my health bar as higher than yours, by the way.
[75:38.31]Because those are my worms.
[75:39.47]Oh, do we actually have separate worm pools?
[75:41.63]Alright, I'm not gonna fuck this up.
[75:45.31]Okay.
[75:46.63]Be careful, Route of Entry.
[75:51.02]Can you go in that store?
[75:56.64]I kind of think you can.
[75:57.64]Are you walking to the edge and jumping?
[75:59.92]No, I'm going to throw a grenade.
[76:01.40]Can we just wait?
[76:02.36]He's going to jump.
[76:03.02]I'm not jumping anywhere.
[76:04.48]I have 23 seconds to get this right, alright?
[76:07.68]Please, please.
[76:08.38]You're not going to aim that.
[76:09.62]You don't have to jump.
[76:11.06]I'm not jumping.
[76:12.34]I think you actually have to jump to hit the right angle there.
[76:15.95]It gets stuck on a tree.
[76:17.27]Oh, my God.
[76:17.67]It gets stuck on a tree.
[76:18.57]Walk back, walk back.
[76:19.29]Thank you, tree.
[76:20.37]What do you mean, walk back?
[76:21.41]You get three seconds to walk back.
[76:23.29]What is this?
[76:28.46]Why was there no bounce?
[76:29.92]That doesn't make any sense.
[76:32.22]That was actually fucking crazy.
[76:34.27]Why did he get stuck in the lip?
[76:35.67]Wow.
[76:35.85]Yeah.
[76:36.01]This guy's playing Mirror's Edge.
[76:41.41]There we go, folks.
[76:44.47]Wow.
[76:45.57]Whoa.

[76:53.74]How do you know it ain't cooked?
[76:55.10]You got the grill right there, buddy.
[76:59.17]Pok, Pok are you a criss-cross, are you a criss-cross grill marks kind of guy or are you a straight across kind of guy?
[77:05.58]I'm honestly like the first one is like a criss-cross and then everything else, I just go crazy with it over time.
[77:11.02]I go around it.
[77:12.43]Nice.
[77:16.19]Oh Jerma, how was your pizza last week?
[77:17.83]It was fucking awesome.

[77:50.29]How'd you do that?
[77:55.59]DM me how you did that so we can have an advantage.
[77:57.69]Oh my god, dude.
[78:01.83]I think you just smashed your keyboard.
[78:14.99]Wow.
[78:17.41]He's quiet.
[78:18.13]I don't know.
[78:19.31]I'm putting the gamer shoes on after this.
[78:24.50]Why did it spawn you here?
[78:29.34]the worst spot you click on the refresh worm symbol you press space to use it and then when the symbol is on your screen you press tab okay alright alright we're back in the game gamer shoes on Germany alright now okay you guys you guys have gamer shoes
[78:47.77]We're on the same team and he's fucking with me still.
[78:50.49]Your feet aren't sliding around.
[78:51.89]Your aim is perfect.
[78:52.95]And I also wear these elbow braces so that they don't slide off of your armrest.
[78:57.67]Okay, how about we drop a... What am I dropping in here?
[79:01.89]Let's see.
[79:02.27]How about you jetpack somewhere safe?
[79:04.69]Pick up all of those freaking boxes in our food poisoning house.
[79:07.51]Uh-huh.
[79:08.93]And then switch to Clinky and get him off the fucking ledge.
[79:12.13]He's right in the water, dude.
[79:13.38]What?
[79:17.12]Come on, you can make it, please!
[79:19.00]God damn it!
[79:23.84]I was the intrusive boss, I guess.
[79:25.48]Why did you tell me to do a... I was gonna throw a grenade in there.
[79:28.12]You, like, pick up all the boxes and they fly up to the fucking ledge with Mr. Clinky.
[79:32.39]What was that?
[79:33.23]I see how this is my fault.
[79:36.13]I see how I did that.
[79:38.79]You have a lot of influence over him.
[79:40.23]I mind-controlled you into doing all of that.
[79:43.44]Just like he mind-controlled you to be worse at the game.
[79:45.96]It's a very, very, like, symbiotic relationship you guys have.
[79:49.78]Yeah, yeah!
[79:52.94]That's right, Ster, you are under my spell.
[79:57.22]Oh, next to the, uh, the weapon.
[80:01.98]Oh, shit!
[80:03.67]I did it by- I don't know how I did that!
[80:06.10]Oh, you pressed, I think, space, I think.
[80:07.44]I think you pressed space again, yeah.
[80:10.28]Oh.
[80:10.64]That would have saved Jerma.
[80:15.24]Jerma would have lived.
[80:16.82]I just dropped into the water for no reason.
[80:19.12]I could have pressed space to get a parachute.
[80:23.83]Dude, I just, I just, like, said a prayer and went down.
[80:27.19]Like, what the fuck?
[80:28.93]What the fuck?
[80:32.16]Dude, is there a gas leak in all of our houses?
[80:34.90]Are we okay?
[80:37.16]Burnt toast is normal, I think.
[80:40.49]On your weapons tab, there's another tab that's the crafting one.
[80:43.37]I just noticed it.
[80:44.61]And I don't know how it works, but that's where it all is.
[80:46.49]Okay, let's use a new color.
[80:48.71]Oh, you can craft while other people are taking their turns, too.
[80:53.07]So crafting?
[80:54.37]Okay.
[80:55.67]Dismantle your Uzi and shit.
[80:59.08]Oh, you get mats.

[81:41.91]Apparently I shot myself.
[81:44.43]Oh, man.
[81:48.17]Gas leaks across the entire country.
[81:50.72]Guys, I forgot to put my game... I'm putting my game right here.
[81:54.10]I can't have this happen again.
[81:57.56]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[81:58.64]This is so stupid.
[82:07.16]I don't think I'm going up that way.
[82:08.86]Alright.
[82:09.74]Alright.
[82:13.77]Alright.

[82:19.83]It's not even good.
[82:20.53]Dude, be careful with that.
[82:21.69]I don't know if that's going to make it.

[82:48.16]I have an idea.
[82:48.96]Just watch out, okay?
[82:52.18]I'm watching.
[82:54.96]If you focus, I'll focus.
[83:04.21]Lock it up!
[83:07.17]It wasn't close
[83:38.82]Grandpa boy.
[83:43.46]Break a leg, grown ass worm.
[83:45.36]Yeah, you should be dead.
[83:48.03]OK.
[83:49.75]And how come my teammate did not compliment me on that Ninja Rope up into the ledge to drop that down there?
[83:54.65]We're supposed to be a team.
[83:56.39]Missed.
[83:59.33]Farts don't matter as long as as that bomb goes off over there.

[84:38.99]What do they do?
[84:40.45]Absolutely nothing.
[84:42.53]They're just worth a lot of money.
[84:44.27]He didn't even buy them.
[84:45.73]He's going to blow up on you.
[84:48.92]Oh, the feet are blown up.
[84:50.82]No.
[84:53.62]I took like seven turns to kill that worm.
[85:00.60]Every time I see that foot, I feel weird.
[85:02.04]I don't know.
[85:04.36]bring some weird feelings up yeah does anybody know mathematically like if you know we can still win maybe yeah I I see a way out I just need to tie my laces I'm going for absolute utter destruction on my next turn
[85:32.93]Immediately leave.
[85:33.87]Space.
[85:34.17]It wasn't space.
[85:36.79]It didn't work.
[85:39.27]Mathematically, there's good odds.
[85:41.41]The odds just got better.
[85:42.41]Mathematically, this is how we can still win.
[85:44.87]Why didn't space work?
[85:46.77]I don't know.
[85:47.11]I think I pressed a lot of buttons.
[85:48.34]Did you guys run out of parachutes?
[85:51.18]You probably used it.
[85:51.76]You might not have any.
[85:53.00]I have three.
[85:55.60]Oh, man.
[85:56.48]This is a problem.
[86:01.36]Okay.

[86:11.52]Why can I move?
[86:12.06]Hello?
[86:15.10]That was weird.
[86:17.24]Why can I aim up?
[86:18.50]That was OK.
[86:18.98]That's very odd.
[86:20.38]Right time.
[86:23.64]I need this.
[86:25.12]Yep, and you're going to get it and you're no, that's a that's a parachute.
[86:28.92]I want to do sheep and then I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[86:33.94]Look at that.
[86:34.98]Huh?
[86:35.60]That's doing work.
[86:36.46]And nobody got to see it because my... Nobody got to see it, but it was worth it.
[86:42.07]I did really good right there.
[86:46.45]Alright.
[86:48.73]Okay.
[86:49.13]Yeah.
[86:49.75]Okay.
[86:50.27]This isn't good.
[86:50.91]Okay.
[87:02.39]You guys see this?
[87:03.61]Yeah.
[87:03.97]What's going on?
[87:05.25]We can't see in there.
[87:07.25]I can see it.
[87:07.71]Yeah, because you're a teammate.
[87:10.55]Oh.
[87:11.59]So that's kind of ridiculous amount of protection.
[87:16.60]The secret wormhole.
[87:19.70]Are you going to fire from inside of the house?
[87:24.68]Um...
[87:35.86]I can make the sound of two ducks at the same time with two different pitches.
[87:38.96]It sounded like a fart in a different way.
[87:41.28]Oh.
[87:43.08]Oh, they got Mr. Clinky.
[87:45.01]They got him.
[87:45.81]I think all my worms are dead, by the way.
[87:48.93]Was that you or was that in the game?
[87:53.09]That was in the game.
[87:53.81]I thought that was one of you.
[87:56.51]Yeah.
[87:57.57]I'm pretty sure that was in the game, yeah.
[88:04.96]Alright, Ster.
[88:14.31]Operation Gamer Shoes.
[88:19.27]Uh oh, I don't like the look of that.
[88:24.79]Is that game good?
[88:25.86]Which game?
[88:26.30]Looney Tunes Rush.
[88:30.16]Is that really a game?
[88:44.60]It sounds like a game you would find on the iPad.
[88:46.68]Is that a game?
[88:49.10]No, it's a... It's a... It's a video.
[88:57.54]It's an adult website.
[89:00.29]I'm out of jetpacks.
[89:01.39]I squandered my jetpacks.
[89:02.61]Alright.
[89:03.11]Alright.
[89:07.30]I don't know, dude, Looney Tunes rush.
[89:09.10]That's I that just I see like Bugs Bunny in the thumbnail, like a big gold coin in his hand running and it's like carrots behind him in a line or something.
[89:18.76]What the hell is going on?
[89:19.69]What the hell is that?
[89:20.99]That's a carpet bomb.
[89:21.87]The world destroyer.
[89:24.05]That's a carpet bomb.
[89:26.87]Roger's definitely dead.
[89:29.03]Roger's definitely.
[89:30.29]Yeah, Roger's like 200 dead.
[89:31.37]Omega dead.
[89:36.54]Uh, Drimmer, you're out.
[89:38.76]Yeah, because I had all my worms and spots that were in bad places and then you fucked up.
[89:47.91]Oh, yeah, sure.
[89:50.74]I can't even say it.
[89:51.44]It's too stupid.
[89:53.14]I'm just chilling.
[90:00.68]Does Poke pick the next game that we play?
[90:05.43]Oh, it actually works.
[90:07.77]That's crazy.
[90:09.61]No, that was no way.
[90:12.99]Dude, Ster, you have... This is a tie game right now, essentially.
[90:18.12]Maybe you're a little bit behind, but I have faith.
[90:21.02]I think I can get him.
[90:21.88]Okay.
[90:24.80]They're going to throw... Weird person's just jumping in the water right now.

[91:38.88]Oh, wow.
[91:40.78]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:49.29]You're using hacks, my worm just said.

[98:33.39]No, it's Ster's fault for picking this map.
[98:36.48]Oh, good point.

[109:28.47]And I'm asking for input.
[109:30.13]I think that we shouldn't have... I haven't been live in like six months.
[109:35.71]So I think we should have all the items, but maybe not like all the crazy ones.
[109:43.21]Okay.
[109:46.26]Okay.
[109:48.48]I think classic plus sounds pretty good.

[110:31.41]You'd have to like dress.
[110:34.22]And mainly like impress.
[110:36.30]All I'm saying is I think people in my chat are more excited about what you just said than their team winning the Super Bowl.
[110:41.66]So, I mean, it looks like people are very excited about that.
[110:45.27]Listen, our friend up there just as free as a little cloud.
[110:49.35]Now, is that game mode available in any other game other than Roblox is my question.
[110:55.49]No.
[110:56.51]Oh, God damn it.
[110:59.95]Do you just hate Roblox?
[111:02.43]Yeah, I've got a couple reasons.
[111:04.55]Let's go.
[111:04.77]Let's talk about it.
[111:08.55]Well, first of all, how did a submarine... What the hell is this?
[111:11.81]I don't know.
[111:14.87]Did you just launch a satellite?
[111:16.20]Like, what did you do?
[111:18.44]we can we now like use like communication devices or something I guess it I guess it doesn't come down for a turn or two we'll never know is that a nuke that might be a nuke oh dude I just looked at my phone I got 5g I may have given us uh everything normal plus one nuke by mistake oh I don't know but yeah it looks like it maybe the w1 rocket yeah oh god
[111:51.32]Was that a sentry gun?
[111:53.34]Yeah.
[111:54.62]Uh-oh.
[111:55.99]Oh, God.
[111:59.73]Oh, that was nothing.
[112:02.47]Okay, I was expecting way worse.
[112:03.65]Yeah, that was not that big of a deal.
[112:05.57]Three damage?
[112:07.41]I mean, sure, keep using it.
[112:10.31]Lost a lot of gas on the way down.
[112:11.97]Bacon sardines!
[112:19.14]Why can't I park me van round here?
[112:21.85]Big moves.
[112:31.28]What is this thing?
[112:32.10]Mischievous drone.
[112:33.66]It's Amazon delivery.
[112:42.32]Come on.
[112:43.06]Why always him?
[112:45.14]I got to get it.
[112:45.76]Don't be so... You're dropping it straight down to plotter.
[112:49.78]No, it's a hit.
[112:52.91]I think I'm OK.
[112:57.35]I think that's OK.
[112:58.69]I think I think that was a two on our team for one on our not.
[113:02.25]I don't think it was.
[113:03.05]We don't have to be committed.
[113:04.05]No, it wasn't.
[113:04.59]It was a 50 damage.
[113:06.13]We're good.
[113:09.13]OK, I guess we take that trade.
[113:11.31]I think we actually made out with more HP from that, by the way.
[113:13.91]I think we're all in a hole.
[113:16.79]And I think he gets to walk out of it.
[113:19.07]You know what?
[113:19.59]I'm sorry.
[113:20.03]I'm being a downer.
[113:21.03]You know what?
[113:21.63]You know what?
[113:22.01]He ain't getting out of here.
[113:25.00]He ain't getting out of here.
[113:26.38]Everything's going to work out.
[113:31.34]You should use a brush rack for that.
[113:33.52]Put the gamer shoes on.
[113:38.00]I got my gamer hat on.
[113:39.40]I'm going to put my gamer cat ears on.
[113:44.96]I got my gamer jockstrap on, lads.
[113:47.62]I'm ready.
[113:49.96]I'm using my gamer mouse.
[113:53.46]Oh yeah, how many DPI does it have?
[113:56.42]Fast.
[113:57.80]That's pretty good.
[113:59.32]I'm gonna put on my gamer striped leggings.
[114:04.15]Oh.
[114:06.09]I'm gonna put on my gamer skirt.
[114:12.12]How have they not come up with, like, an RGB cereal at this point?
[114:15.68]Like, it's kind of annoying.
[114:17.92]What do you mean, an RGB cereal?
[114:20.94]The quickest thing you could come up with to interrupt me.
[114:24.90]That was it?
[114:25.93]That was the idea?
[114:30.79]No!
[114:31.77]No, that's not fair!
[114:33.37]That's not fair!
[114:36.49]Fruity Pebbles, just branded differently.
[114:38.53]Oh, yeah, I guess so.
[114:40.92]No, it would be the front of the box.
[114:42.48]Does the box have RBG or like the food?
[114:45.46]Nobody fucking gets it.
[114:47.42]The back of the box is the inside of the computer artwork.
[114:52.13]The front of the box is like a solid kind of a case with a power button on it.
[114:56.15]Fucking my God.
[114:57.19]Do I really need to explain this?
[115:02.08]And the motherboard is a maze that you get to play with.
[115:05.48]With a, you know, you take a pencil and come on.
[115:12.55]No.
[115:13.91]Has anybody eaten a cereal that had cartoon characters on it?
[115:17.70]Actually, they don't do games on cereals anymore, do they?
[115:21.54]We talked about this last week.
[115:26.63]I miss when the camel sold me cigarettes, but... Yeah.
[115:30.59]Same.
[115:32.39]Yeah.
[115:33.53]It's never been the same.
[115:34.99]Yeah, but Jerm, I can't like... I like sugar too much, but I like buy old man cereal now.
[115:41.50]Like cardboard flakes.
[115:43.62]I'm a liar.
[115:45.88]I am full of shit.
[115:47.08]There's only one box of cereal in my pantry.
[115:50.34]My area.
[115:51.32]And it's just regular yellow Cheerios.
[115:54.66]I'm not kidding.
[115:57.19]How frequently do you eat cereal?
[115:59.29]Maybe like, I don't know.
[116:00.63]I keep some of those on hand too in case I need to ship a package.
[116:04.39]What do I do about this?
[116:05.59]I want to like... Okay, I have an idea.
[116:10.83]Now somebody told me... Is Frosted Mini Wheat's old people cereal?
[116:15.56]No.
[116:16.28]They're frosted, dog.
[116:18.66]True, okay.
[116:19.88]Yeah, that's... It's not... Like, if it's not good for you... Get the fuck away from me!
[116:25.89]Don't go in the hole.
[116:27.97]Oh shit, his sentry gun!
[116:30.51]It's shooting you too?
[116:32.15]Why is it shooting me?
[116:33.01]I hope I don't lose subs for that.
[116:35.05]Oh, that was a good... That was a lot of things.
[116:36.83]What a menace.
[116:41.76]That was pretty good.
[116:42.70]I'll take it.
[116:47.46]Frosted Mini-Meats was the best.
[116:50.34]I like those.
[116:51.24]I was a big Cinnamon Toast Crunch kind of guy.
[116:56.00]I haven't had cereal in a while.
[116:56.94]I have Raisin Bran right now.
[116:58.22]I haven't even opened it.
[116:59.31]We should all meet.
[117:00.15]We should all fly across the country and eat cereal.
[117:03.43]Do a cereal mukbang.
[117:05.13]Yes, and see who can hit the longest drive.
[117:07.51]You know what I mean?
[117:09.45]Hell yeah.
[117:11.17]Wow.
[117:11.43]Longest drive in cereal.
[117:13.41]Wow.
[117:14.51]You get to hit 10 balls at the driving range.
[117:19.38]There's a guy dressed as a clown running around out where we are driving.
[117:23.56]That sounds very Jerma.
[117:24.92]Yeah.
[117:28.59]Why just him?
[117:29.41]Dude, my game just crashed.
[117:32.39]I'm fine.
[117:36.08]Have you ever done the batting cage, Jerma?
[117:37.80]You do that?
[117:38.58]Yeah.
[117:38.82]Oh, yeah.
[117:40.32]Yeah, that I used to do.
[117:42.72]I think my arms would crumble if I did that these days.
[117:46.46]I don't know.
[117:47.58]Probably.
[117:49.82]But if there were clowns at the batting range and we tried to hit balls at clowns, that would be pretty cool.
[117:55.22]That's a beaut.
[117:56.75]No, they're not real.
[117:58.29]It's just clowns.
[117:59.01]I don't fuck with clowns.
[118:08.25]I've avoided clowns many years of my life.
[118:13.27]I'd like to continue that.
[118:16.45]Ooh.
[118:19.90]Does that feel good?
[118:22.32]Killing a worm?
[118:23.48]And now he's going to blow up.
[118:26.00]Ster.
[118:28.72]it's one down minus one action economy Google it oh all this coffee pasta needs to shut up whoa okay whoa oh my god
[119:00.92]What am I doing here?
[119:01.60]What am I doing?
[119:02.06]Okay, let me do something good.
[119:03.40]What are we doing?
[119:06.83]There's a pretty strong W1 rocket.
[119:15.11]Good.
[119:17.23]Effective.
[119:17.75]Why don't we just go right into this little house?
[119:21.69]It's my house now.
[119:24.83]Ooh.
[119:34.08]Well.
[119:35.74]You know he's in that house.
[119:36.84]I do, but there's somebody standing on that house.
[119:40.20]It doesn't topple over.
[119:41.24]There's no physics like that.
[119:42.80]I know, but it falls.
[119:45.32]It falls down the whole hill.
[119:47.44]Can I go in there?
[119:49.69]Yeah, I'm just going in.
[119:55.55]Worms truly is the original evolution.
[119:58.69]For real.
[120:02.46]Okay, I got an idea.
[120:03.38]You think the new worms should have physics?
[120:04.94]Hey, you better stay the fuck away from me.
[120:08.92]They should do noido worms.
[120:10.70]Why is it not shooting?
[120:15.24]I don't know.
[120:15.54]We can't see.
[120:16.14]We don't know what you're doing.
[120:19.08]You put a turret next to him?
[120:20.44]Yeah, I thought I was going to start firing him.
[120:22.22]I don't think that's quite how defensive turrets work in this video game.
[120:28.28]I just love that No, he's dead Why have you done this?
[120:56.54]Ster uh I'm gonna need some coaching because all of your guys are real I threw this whole game guys guys I'm so sorry this wouldn't happen if you guys downloaded my worms mods check out the rivets on what worms but you didn't tell us about a worms mod
[121:16.62]You don't have it?
[121:17.60]Jerma pulled me aside before the stream and said I was embarrassing him.
[121:22.38]What the fuck?
[121:23.34]I'm like paying attention to you talking to me.
[121:26.44]What just happened?
[121:27.40]What?
[121:27.62]That is a far fucking way.
[121:28.70]I didn't know it was that far.
[121:29.72]Oh my god.
[121:38.07]I was intently listening to what you were saying, like a dog.
[121:41.40]Like when you mentioned like food in the house, you know what I mean?
[121:43.82]Like I was like, my ear was up like, hmm?
[121:45.02]He's talking about me.
[121:46.66]What's he saying?
[121:48.06]That's my name.
[121:48.80]My name?
[121:49.34]You said me?
[121:49.94]Yes.
[121:50.64]A treat?
[121:51.50]A treat?
[121:52.16]A treat?
[121:56.91]I don't think we're winning this one.
[121:58.69]I think we will.
[121:59.63]I gotta remember to not speak to you while you're playing.
[122:04.99]You jokingly do it too.
[122:08.06]Please clear comms here.
[122:12.58]My fans will start unsubscribing soon.

[122:29.03]Do not burn my turret.
[122:32.09]This ain't a Sparky's job.
[122:33.89]Well, I want to feel the sharpness of my chisel.
[122:38.21]Alright, let me see what I got in my arsenal.
[122:47.68]Oh!

[125:29.30]Throw it down the hole.

[126:25.54]I don't even know if that's real.
[126:27.82]No!
[126:28.24]I thought he was going to fall into the... I knew he was going to kill that one, but I thought that... I thought Sklumpet was going in the water.
[126:35.01]No!
[126:45.39]Everybody thinks I'm going to lose, but I do still forgetting that who was sitting here with beautiful turrets ready to just it's ready.

[127:26.37]Okay.
[127:31.15]I can't get out.
[127:33.76]Do not shoot me, please.
[127:34.90]Okay.
[127:37.08]Really, diapers have a bad rep.
[127:46.40]We don't get to see what you're doing, but the outcome is not surprising.
[127:50.64]It's not ideal.
[127:51.56]It's not ideal.
[127:54.24]I thought it was... I'm trying to knock him out of the... Because he's going to throw a fucking grenade at me.
[128:00.54]No, you got this comeback.
[128:01.90]We've seen crazier comebacks.
[128:04.66]This is the first time we've even seen a descent.
[128:07.40]Okay, good, good.
[128:08.20]I'm glad that it killed you, and I'm going to be still alive, I think.
[128:10.28]I forgot about the turret.
[128:10.86]I couldn't see it inside the... That's perfect, actually.
[128:14.53]There's nothing in there.
[128:16.85]Guys, check this out.

[129:28.32]You're not wrong.
[129:42.77]I don't know.
[129:45.55]It's over.
[129:47.23]It's over.
[129:48.73]Where you live, huh?
[129:49.51]No.
[129:49.63]No, the grass.
[129:53.99]Oh, God, the carpet bomb.
[129:56.55]I think I'll live.
[129:59.17]No.
[129:59.45]Oh, there they all go.
[130:00.59]Alright.
[130:00.83]I'm good.
[130:01.66]I'm good.
[130:02.74]Wow.
[130:04.34]I couldn't change the direction.
[130:07.38]Okay, we believe you.
[130:08.94]No!
[130:09.50]The carp is... Oh my god.
[130:14.20]Alright.
[130:21.44]As long as Jerma doesn't have a carpet bomb, we're good.
[130:24.10]What the hell is this dude?
[130:25.92]Alright, this is going to be really stupid, but I think it's going to be okay.
[130:32.66]Look, who cares?
[130:33.28]Who cares?
[130:37.47]A lot of people care.
[130:38.39]Why can I not turn around?
[130:39.27]It's cool to care.
[130:40.91]Okay, all I got to do is this.
[130:43.96]I call this the jackhammer.
[130:49.68]Why did it not fly over?
[130:51.04]I thought it was going towards you.
[130:52.76]What?
[130:56.60]Why did it not fly up?
[130:59.60]Every time anyone's shot a homing missile at me, it flies up and does a giant fucking curve.
[131:07.55]Did I do it too hot?
[131:08.53]Did I shoot too far?
[131:11.23]Didn't shoot it high enough?
[131:13.68]Perhaps the wind.
[131:15.88]Perhaps.
[131:21.44]Perhaps.
[131:21.92]Okay, I don't know what to do here.
[131:29.81]Just chuck a grenade.
[131:31.65]Just throw it from there.
[131:32.77]You got aim?
[131:34.54]I mean, that'd be awesome if you got me from there.
[131:40.84]What is this?
[131:41.54]What is this?
[131:41.94]What have I shot?
[131:44.16]What?
[131:45.48]Okay.
[131:46.86]Oh.
[131:47.42]Oh.
[131:49.24]Oh, that looks dangerous.
[131:51.18]Yeah, no one walked there.
[131:53.54]Okay.
[131:57.18]Okay, let me... Hold on.
[131:58.68]I have... Hold on, wait.
[132:00.95]Can you hold A?
[132:02.19]Hold on a second.
[132:15.13]No.
[132:19.43]Oh, no.
[132:20.41]Don't do this.
[132:22.15]You're really gonna... No.
[132:25.25]Get me back in the house.
[132:25.75]Get me back in the house.
[132:26.64]Get me back in the fucking house.
[132:27.44]Uh-oh.
[132:27.70]I don't... I don't have a back door, apparently.
[132:39.70]Oh no, guys.
[132:42.52]It all comes down to this.
[132:45.24]This is the last moment of game, guys.
[132:47.68]Grenade.
[132:49.56]From here.
[132:51.80]That would be probably the best worm ever if that worked.
[132:55.88]That would be incredible.
[132:59.73]I keep thinking these worms are Conan O'Brien, but it's just a sausage on their head.
[133:03.89]You ready?
[133:04.23]You gonna get it?
[133:06.39]If you get it, this is huge.
[133:10.40]Dude, no way.
[133:13.89]That was going there.
[133:14.97]That was perfect.
[133:20.05]That's perfect.
[133:22.95]Well damn.
[133:26.32]Alright, let's see it come back King.
[133:29.02]Oh, I could put four seconds fuse.
[133:32.98]Right time.
[133:37.03]oh boy well isn't that just interesting imagine the world where this is like bigger than league of legends we fun we're all watching the worms well chess came back for a while people were like
[134:05.63]Get really into chess.
[134:06.89]Oh alright.
[134:08.29]I only got two more worms to deal with here.
[134:11.97]Guys, we can't let Jerma win.
[134:15.78]Yeah, the reason I went for that one is because you were a little carried down there.
[134:19.52]A well timed grenade from there.
[134:25.29]Isn't it crazy how influential he really is?
[134:30.21]But the 4 second fuse.
[134:33.23]Oh, banana's cheating.
[134:34.07]You gotta throw a grenade from there.
[134:37.33]It ain't even gonna make it.
[134:38.77]Yeah, you never would have hit the grenade.
[134:44.13]Alright, I gotta get some well-timed bros here.
[134:46.79]I had a bunker buster.
[134:48.11]I was gonna use it, but I figured that would be, like, kind of boring.
[134:54.23]So, that's not cool.
[134:57.23]Yeah, if I live again, I'm just gonna use it.
[135:08.82]Winds in your favor.
[135:09.76]Yeah, that's a bad thing.
[135:15.35]I think there's a worms golf game.
[135:17.53]I'm recalling.
[135:27.20]Tons of wind, tons of wind, tons of wind.
[135:29.70]God damn it.
[135:32.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[135:33.78]I don't know what to do.
[135:36.36]There is worms crazy golf.
[135:37.72]It's real.
[135:39.99]2011.
[135:42.41]You know something's a little, a little sus when it tells you on the cover it's crazy.
[135:47.20]Yeah, it doesn't look that good.
[135:48.84]Banana?
[135:50.76]Yeah... I do have the banana, but... I still have to kill them both.
[135:59.04]I thought I could get it.
[136:01.98]How do you up the fuse?
[136:06.04]Oh!
[136:07.36]Ooh!
[136:07.54]That's not good.
[136:12.03]It's over if I can make a well-timed shot here.
[136:14.61]If I can get over there, it's fucking over.
[136:17.69]That's really bad for me.
[136:22.31]Like I should have used the bunker buster.
[136:24.41]Dude, I just gotta get it.
[136:27.39]I just gotta get over there.
[136:28.57]I just gotta get over there and I'm gonna play it very safely and I'm getting my ass over there.
[136:36.05]That was really bad for me.
[136:45.22]Nah, he's gonna miss.
[136:46.64]I'm gonna fuck this up, but shh.
[136:49.33]Grenade only.
[136:50.19]Deal?
[136:50.87]Grenade only?
[136:52.99]Deal.
[136:56.97]Put a fuse.
[137:00.45]That ain't hitting me, bro.
[137:04.82]Damn, he used my tactic on you.
[137:07.34]I set you up with like three or four kills.
[137:10.86]And then you get baited by the grenade only.
[137:13.09]Yeah, but if somebody says grenade only and it's only one person left, you have to abide by that.
[137:21.22]There is not a good spot job.
[137:24.94]I'm not in a divot.
[137:25.70]I'm not in a hole.
[137:26.28]No.
[137:27.62]You got this.
[137:35.06]You can set the fuse time with one through five and the bounce level with plus and minus.
[137:40.06]Bounce level?
[137:41.04]Oh, I didn't know that.
[137:42.10]There's bounce levels.
[137:43.82]That's crazy.
[137:44.68]So I should do a long fuse.
[137:45.72]What is it, five?
[137:46.38]Yeah, you should do a five.
[137:50.55]Okay, so five seconds.
[137:53.25]No way you can increase the bounce.
[137:55.83]So I don't want to bounce.
[137:56.77]Fuck that.
[138:02.68]Oh, you can increase the bounce with space.
[138:07.79]Oh, no!
[138:15.02]Close.
[138:16.46]No bounce, you get him, baby.
[138:18.40]A little.
[138:27.67]Poke has got this lined up perfectly.
[138:30.95]If he can get the trajectory here.
[138:34.95]If he hits it, he has it lined up.
[138:39.37]If he hits it, he's got it lined up and it should land.
[138:41.71]Oh.
[138:42.79]Oh, that bounce.
[138:46.29]No, we're good.
[138:47.87]No, I put the bounce too high.
[138:49.23]My bad.
[138:49.57]Nothing like some new hardware.
[138:55.38]Okay.
[138:56.54]Okay.
[139:01.28]VOD watchers skip two hours.
[139:04.19]Hey, VOD watchers.
[139:05.75]That's right.
[139:06.09]I'm talking to you.
[139:08.23]Watch this.
[139:15.01]Same hole.
[139:16.59]Well, there was a ton of wind this time.
[139:17.76]Look at all that.
[139:18.42]It just keeps going for my grave.
[139:20.16]Same hole.
[139:22.54]My rotten corpse is just getting fucking exploded.
[139:25.48]The wind is freaking me out.
[139:32.15]Wind does not affect grenades.
[139:33.95]What?
[139:35.43]What?
[139:36.13]Why?
[139:36.71]I feel like that doesn't make sense, but alright.
[139:41.61]Uh-oh.
[139:42.78]We got, we got, we got, no.
[139:45.58]Oi, this ain't no YTS.
[139:49.70]I think I know what to do here.
[139:54.64]Why wouldn't the wind affect grenades?
[139:56.18]Who made this?
[139:58.37]Check out the rivets on that.
[140:02.56]it does not in fact work on it doesn't being told that's not a grenade that's not a grenade only thing what's going on here what do you mean grenade only I know I know what I'm doing that's not a grenade I'm just trying to make this way harder for you to hit me oh so we can move wait can we not move I actually just made it I think probably easier for you because I was on that lip yeah I think so
[140:30.87]Oh, that's... Oh, shit.
[140:33.21]Ah.
[140:33.87]No.
[140:36.17]Christ, he's creeping.
[140:44.78]Yeah, you get one bounce and it's over.
[140:49.56]Hello?
[140:50.66]Hello?
[140:51.70]Hello?
[140:52.26]Yeah, what happened?
[140:53.02]Did he pull the plug?
[140:55.15]He pulled the plug?
[140:56.17]Jerma?
[140:57.05]Am I not here?
[140:58.11]What?
[140:58.33]What's going on?
[140:59.44]I hear you, Jerma.
[141:00.76]It's not moving turns.
[141:03.94]Oh yeah, that is weird.
[141:05.28]It's getting bored.
[141:06.02]Yeah, why?
[141:07.92]Yeah, everything froze.
[141:13.19]Okay.
[141:13.69]Yeah, it's out of memory.
[141:15.67]I guess we'll call that a tie.
[141:20.71]Someone in my chat said this happens from time to time with this game and just give it a minute.
[141:24.78]Give it a minute?
[141:25.26]Okay.
[141:26.50]That was a really complicated turn.
[141:29.29]He's doing the math right now.
[141:29.99]Lots to compute.
[141:30.57]This is like when you end turn in Civilization and you're in like the year 2000.
[141:38.76]How long does it take to compute, Ster?
[141:42.44]A while.
[141:44.20]I've never played Civ, so...
[141:45.93]Oh, when it gets in a late game, you gotta like simulate 5,000 different pieces moving.
[141:51.31]It takes this long.
[141:53.41]Somebody at team 17 right now is like blowing on the server, like with their mouth, like trying to make this thing cool down.
[142:00.20]It's hosting probably every game.
[142:06.24]All worms games on a single iPhone 4.
[142:08.38]Uh, oh well.
[142:12.89]Have you guys seen that game, Abiotic Factor?
[142:15.44]No.
[142:16.38]Yes.
[142:17.88]I mentioned it to Jerma.
[142:19.54]I saw Vinny play it.
[142:20.78]Like the Half-Life 1 co-op-ish.
[142:22.94]It's very, very good.
[142:24.72]It's got a big update too.
[142:27.34]I saw someone playing Pilgrim and it looked really cool.
[142:29.64]The Lethal Company-like.
[142:33.94]Oh, there we go.
[142:36.79]You were just dancing for a second.
[142:38.07]Was that you doing that or was that?
[142:39.91]No.
[142:41.47]I played Pilgrim with you guys.
[142:45.53]Is it scary?
[142:46.05]I haven't played it.
[142:49.61]I saw only a tiny little bit of it and it looked neat.
[142:51.79]Alright, so what are we up to here?
[142:59.79]It looks like it's borked.
[143:01.25]I think it might be fried.
[143:03.57]Yeah.
[143:04.37]Think of a number, Ster, think of a number.
[143:07.05]One to ten?
[143:09.17]From one to ten, thinking of a number, yes.
[143:12.39]Okay.
[143:15.99]I'll go first.
[143:16.85]I'll say six.
[143:18.80]That is wrong.
[143:21.62]That's wrong.
[143:22.56]Well, you saying it's wrong isn't good because now he's not going to say six.
[143:26.38]Or seven.
[143:27.28]What are we talking?
[143:28.16]What are you doing?
[143:29.54]Jerma is going to guess a number now.
[143:30.91]Okay, so I would say two.
[143:34.15]No.
[143:35.51]So who's closer?
[143:36.13]It was four, so you're exactly...
[143:45.20]Okay, I'm gonna say a vegetable.
[143:47.02]Okay, Poke, I'm gonna say a vegetable.
[143:49.80]You are to say another vegetable, and we go back and forth.
[143:52.78]You only have five seconds to name a vegetable.
[143:55.06]If you cannot name a vegetable in five seconds, the other person wins.
[143:58.04]I'll count.
[143:58.68]It's unfair because you know more vegetables, but okay, go ahead.
[144:01.92]I might not.
[144:02.48]Okay, carrot.
[144:04.60]Cucumber.
[144:05.48]Beets.
[144:10.20]Celery.
[144:11.58]Broccoli.
[144:12.80]Carrots.
[144:13.94]I already said carrots.
[144:17.48]Wait, no, that's over.
[144:18.68]Isn't that over?
[144:19.20]Yeah, you took too long.
[144:20.64]No, he said carrot.
[144:23.20]He said carrot.
[144:25.83]God damn it.
[144:29.83]You named one vegetable and your next one was right on the line of five seconds for you to think of a second vegetable, by the way.
[144:39.31]Okay, think of a fruit from one to ten.
[144:43.69]Alright, I guess it's a tie, but also Jerma wins, kinda.
[144:48.25]Alright, so are we leaving here?
[144:50.53]Are we fucking leaving?
[144:51.93]You gotta exit.
[144:53.99]Oh, that was funny.
[144:54.97]If I leave the game, what if it fixes it?
[145:05.39]Do we want to do EDF?
[145:06.65]How do you guys feel about little EDF?
[145:08.53]I feel like you really want EDF.
[145:10.21]I'm in an EDF kind of mood right now.
[145:12.29]We want to do EDF.
[145:12.97]Wait.
[145:13.86]Yeah?
[145:14.34]Oh, it ended.
[145:15.64]Oh.
[145:15.92]Yeah.
[145:16.82]Yeah.
[145:18.08]Can we take a bathroom break first?
[145:19.60]Yeah.
[145:20.38]I say, yeah, it's time.
[145:22.75]okay bathroom break and I'll I'll get people invited cool alright I have uh we we're playing a little bit I have some of the all-time uh they have some of the edf5 missions some of the absolute classics I'd highly recommend bumping up the npc volume and and really strapping in for some of the ultimate lore oh okay whatever you want Ster is is fine by me
[145:46.50]That's what I want.
[145:47.42]I want you to make the NPC dialogue louder than the sound effects.
[145:50.74]And I want you to pay attention.
[145:52.16]Did you give us a weird fucking mod here?
[145:54.53]Like, what did you give us?
[145:55.69]No, it's the mission.
[145:56.57]You know the mission.
[145:57.83]Oh, okay.
[145:58.31]Okay, I was like, why is he telling us to, like, turn our volume up and shit?
[146:02.63]Oh, yeah.
[146:03.39]There's this weird Hatsune Miku mod that I put inside that.
[146:06.79]I'll be right back.
[146:08.18]I'm not even listening.
[146:10.02]We are soldiers.
[146:11.98]Alright.
