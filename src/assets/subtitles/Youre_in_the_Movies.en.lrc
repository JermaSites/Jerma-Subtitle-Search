[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.62]I'm back.
[00:02.74]I'm here.
[00:03.62]I made it.
[00:07.27]The internet works.
[00:09.03]Stream is bopping.
[00:11.49]I can feel the energy.
[00:12.55]Hi guys.
[00:18.34]It's time for the movies.
[00:19.12]We've been waiting for this like three days.
[00:24.02]The internet has been fixed.
[00:26.74]I've been assured of that.
[00:30.63]We've done a lot of testing.
[00:34.47]Almost no drop frames in the last probably 12 to 15 hours.
[00:40.02]That's pretty good.
[00:40.70]That's the green light.
[00:41.54]Now, if we get a red light here, then that's, I mean, that's not fair.
[00:47.80]But you kind of have to do what you do, right?
[00:52.04]Are you talking to me?
[00:53.50]Yeah.
[00:56.21]But anyways, this room has been set up for the last three days to do this.
[01:00.43]And I've been really excited to do this because this game looks really fun.
[01:04.07]Looks like a good time.
[01:10.22]Move this out of the way.
[01:14.24]So everything gets zapped on like a monthly basis here.
[01:19.54]And it's very frustrating.
[01:21.28]Can I just say?
[01:21.74]I mean, you guys know this.
[01:25.35]But I'm ready.
[01:27.05]I'm not going to wait anymore.
[01:28.17]This is ready to go.
[01:29.01]Want me to prove it?
[01:33.62]Hold on.
[01:38.68]Take a look at this shit.
[01:39.42]Alright, we're going to test.
[01:47.00]We're going to make sure it's synced up correctly.
[01:48.68]Yes, I'm wearing a wire.
[01:50.44]I'm sure you've been aware of that.
[01:51.52]Is the frame ready or what?
[01:53.84]No, we're good.
[01:55.39]I'm in my workout gear.
[02:00.37]That's an Xbox Live Vision camera.
[02:04.65]They don't make these anymore.
[02:05.77]You have to buy them from third party sellers.
[02:08.96]I bought two of them, just in case the price goes up.
[02:13.50]And of course, I've got my cocktail table over here.
[02:16.48]Apparently doing a bay breeze, if you don't know what that is.
[02:21.96]Look it up, it's tasty.
[02:24.76]Metal straw, yeah!
[02:26.25]It's better that way, it's colder.
[02:30.29]See?
[02:33.29]What is this?
[02:34.13]Ah, you'll find out.
[02:36.77]You'll find out real soon.
[02:38.21]Alright, so let's just do it.
[02:40.19]Let me get locked in.
[02:45.39]You can't even hear, the music is fucking awesome.
[02:48.36]There, now you can hear everything.
[02:50.16]We gotta sync this up, make sure.
[02:51.52]Can you see my mouth move when my mouth moves?
[02:55.26]One, two, three, four.
[02:58.06]Hey, we got a green screen back here.
[03:00.10]Let's add some footage right now.
[03:01.74]Here we go.
[03:07.66]I'm in a car now.
[03:10.28]Take that one, put it somewhere, I don't know.
[03:12.06]How about this one?
[03:14.12]He's riding a horse.
[03:21.71]Use it, use any of this.
[03:23.61]Who cares?
[03:28.13]That's two extra bonus clips that you didn't have before.
[03:30.27]Keep that in mind.
[03:32.49]Alright.
[03:34.34]What'd he say?
[03:35.00]The sink is off?
[03:36.80]Ready?
[03:39.52]Here we go.
[03:40.04]Did you hear that?
[03:44.96]Hey!
[03:46.42]Hey!
[03:47.78]Hey!
[03:50.22]It's off?
[03:50.78]What?
[03:52.28]How off is it?
[03:56.07]Alright, can you hear my voice first or hear my voice later?
[03:58.45]And this is very important.
[04:05.43]My audio is early.
[04:07.55]You hear it, you hear the- Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[04:10.47]So, if I'm early... Shit, hold on, if I'm early... How about now?
[04:22.18]Ready?
[04:24.24]Oh, hold on, ready?
[04:27.08]How was that?
[04:32.30]Better?
[04:33.94]Let's try.
[04:40.44]Good?
[04:40.74]To the music?
[04:41.52]To the beat?
[04:42.74]It's gotta be to the beat, it's important.
[04:49.23]Yeah, alright, good, let's go.
[04:53.53]Is it in focus?
[04:54.85]This is on the Xbox 360, by the way.
[04:56.28]They don't make these anymore.
[04:57.30]They don't even make Xboxes anymore.
[04:59.00]Are we in focus?
[05:02.36]Yes.
[05:02.64]Uh-oh.
[05:03.78]It's a little out of the green.
[05:05.38]No, it's still in the green.
[05:06.78]That's alright.
[05:08.71]It's okay.
[05:14.97]Now, let's position the camera.
[05:17.35]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline without appearing too small or too big.
[05:23.49]If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in, tilt the camera up or down and try again.
[05:32.39]Welcome to the cutout studio.
[05:34.51]This is where we separate your image from the background.
[05:38.19]Select start.
[05:40.17]Great.
[05:41.57]Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[05:46.27]Please hold on.
[05:48.99]Cutout complete.
[05:51.05]Now get back in front of the camera.
[05:53.49]Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best results.
[05:58.50]Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[06:03.10]What do you guys think?
[06:06.96]Four?
[06:07.30]I think four looks good.
[06:09.30]Four has a little bit of haze in it, though.
[06:13.26]One is bad, two is worse, three is okay, four is haze.
[06:16.74]I don't know if I like four.
[06:19.63]Which one?
[06:22.07]You tell me, right?
[06:28.83]Shit!
[06:30.47]This is two.
[06:34.50]This is three.
[06:39.06]This one's four.
[06:39.66]It's one.
[06:48.03]Two or three?
[06:49.49]Try one more time.
[06:50.87]I'll give you a lefty.
[06:54.89]Nope, it's okay.
[06:56.85]We need to be trained at a very young age to use both of our hands and arms.
[07:01.69]Because seriously, take a look at this.
[07:03.01]Ready, go.
[07:07.67]If you're coming from over here, or if you're coming from that one, you're gonna laugh.
[07:13.94]I can't fend off an attacker that way.
[07:17.38]Why can nobody use, we need to be taught at a young age to use both of our hands.
[07:22.42]I can't, throwing a ball like this is like, throwing a ball like this, I could fucking, I could go 100.
[07:30.43]Alright, two looks good.
[07:35.50]I already winded it.
[07:39.06]This might be a quick one.
[07:41.87]I've been waiting, I've been, I've been waiting fucking three days to do this and I'm already like, oh, I threw four punches, it's time to go home.
[07:49.43]Alright.
[07:51.89]Uh.
[07:52.67]Ah, no, no, no, no free.
[07:54.23]Two, two's fine.
[07:56.53]One's actually not that bad either.
[07:59.85]I'll go two.
[08:00.67]Two's fine.
[08:03.00]How many actors are there?
[08:04.91]Choose the correct number.
[08:06.89]I could do this one, but not yet.
[08:09.23]We'll do one.
[08:14.42]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[08:17.98]This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[08:22.48]No, no, no, no.
[08:23.24]I want a new picture.
[08:26.71]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[08:30.27]This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[08:34.37]That's scary.
[08:35.05]Hold on, another one.
[08:38.06]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[08:41.64]This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[08:44.60]Why am I so scary looking?
[08:46.22]I just ripped out the fucking cord.
[08:48.88]What?
[08:49.02]I don't care.
[08:49.70]Hold on, I have to connect my fucking wire.
[08:55.15]Player one, get your butt on the set.
[08:59.67]Alright, this is me?
[09:05.73]Dodge the arms and strike the targets, yeah.
[09:08.05]I tested this one.
[09:09.58]Pretend you're in a dojo preparing for a big fight.
[09:13.60]Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score.
[09:18.48]Anytime you look at somebody from the side, it's just like, ooh.
[09:20.34]Action!
[09:22.55]You fight like a master.
[09:26.84]Oops.
[09:27.20]What?
[09:27.58]What's happening in the corner?
[09:32.41]What's happening?
[09:33.39]This is fucking stupid.
[09:35.95]Always use the paw.
[09:38.97]Always use the paw.
[09:39.51]Right here.
[09:55.41]Ouch, that smarts.
[09:56.87]Then we can play Nick Arcade.
[09:59.01]Revenge.
[10:05.55]What a crushing blow.
[10:11.43]Awesome.
[10:12.31]Got it.
[10:13.39]You just beat the heck out of Bruce Lee there.
[10:15.88]Whew.
[10:18.22]Whew.
[10:19.72]That wasn't bad.
[10:21.20]Player one, come to the set, please.
[10:27.36]I broke the fucking audio Jack.
[10:28.80]And now it's your time to shine.
[10:31.54]What do I do?
[10:31.86]Just follow my instructions and act like a star.
[10:36.53]Okay.
[10:36.67]Give me your most evil laugh.
[10:42.29]When?
[10:42.55]Now?
[10:42.75]Action.
[10:44.97]Come on.
[10:46.81]Come on.
[10:51.08]That was fantastic.
[10:52.66]Okay, got it.
[10:53.18]You were a star.
[10:57.73]That's it?
[10:58.05]Alright, let's go!
[11:00.13]Star... I look like a fucking character from The Office.
[11:11.60]I'm doing like a look in the camera.
[11:14.14]Can you believe what... Steve Carell just said?
[11:21.19]Play a one, you need it on set.
[11:27.87]Alright, what's next?
[11:29.63]Throw the log as far... Alright, I can do it with my right hand.
[11:32.31]Throw the log.
[11:32.77]Okay.
[11:32.89]Was that 650?
[11:33.11]That wasn't bad.
[11:34.13]That's kind of far.
[11:57.01]Again?
[12:06.58]Not bad at all!
[12:07.52]200!
[12:08.58]Wait, I gotta be like in the... It's gotta be quick.
[12:24.04]Good throwing.
[12:26.10]That log sure won't bother us again.
[12:28.42]I thought it was going to be like a situation where you just had to get the thing, the pixel, to touch quick.
[12:34.60]Player one, get yourself to the set.
[12:36.82]Don't worry, that's me.
[12:37.52]I know where I'm supposed to be.
[12:38.54]Right here.
[12:41.92]And now it's your time to shine.
[12:45.02]Just follow my instructions and act like a star.
[12:47.40]Give me some acting.
[12:50.58]Show me fury.
[12:52.23]Okay, fury.
[13:05.14]That was fantastic!
[13:07.16]You were a star!
[13:12.83]Alright, I'm good.
[13:20.63]Imagine, like, looking into my window right now.
[13:25.33]What am I practicing for?
[13:30.34]What is that person doing?
[13:33.23]Because there is no logical explanation as to why somebody would be standing in their room doing this.
[13:38.72]I'm like hyping myself up for what, like a conference?
[13:49.26]Look at how red my face is.
[13:51.07]I didn't realize how hot it was gonna be in here.
[13:52.61]What do I, okay.
[13:52.97]What's going on with my face?
[13:54.97]I'm like as red as the, no I'm not, am I?
[14:05.01]What?
[14:10.94]I'm not very good at this, am I?
[14:20.36]Holy shit, I'm turning, like, green.
[14:22.36]I'm not this red.
[14:26.76]Am I this red?
[14:28.22]What's happening?
[14:28.90]I'm, like, turning...
[14:32.70]I swear to God, this is like, this is like bizarre.
[14:36.00]It's the camera.
[14:39.88]I'm turning into a Willy Wonka character.
[14:42.29]I have a sunburn.
[14:48.67]Oh.
[14:51.31]Player one, to the set.
[14:52.73]What the fuck?
[14:54.13]No, no, I gotta like, get, it's 110 degrees in Vegas right now.
[14:58.11]What the fuck was I thinking?
[15:00.41]Get the ball of the hole three times.
[15:03.06]It's all the fun of the fair.
[15:05.78]Throw the ball in the hoop three times to win a prize.
[15:08.92]Hey, let me do this like, this is like, oh, I gotta shoot the basket.
[15:13.92]I don't, I'm not really, I'm not this red.
[15:15.43]Look and see, I'm not that red.
[15:16.69]Where's the basket?
[15:17.31]Where's the ball?
[15:20.71]What?
[15:21.01]I don't.
[15:21.73]Oh, that was close, but no cigar.
[15:23.99]Alright, okay.
[15:28.84]Got it.
[15:29.76]Two.
[15:30.34]Only one more left.
[15:35.66]You can do better than that.
[15:39.54]Get in there.
[15:41.00]Come on.
[15:42.16]Sink the ball into the hole.
[15:43.80]We have a winner, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:48.06]You were magic.
[15:52.63]By the way, at the end of this, it cuts up a trailer.
[15:55.79]With like three other random actors that aren't in this house.
[16:03.15]That's a wrap.
[16:04.75]That's a wrap.
[16:09.64]Let's see.
[16:10.02]Are you ready?
[16:11.64]I'm ready.
[16:21.69]Play every character?
[16:22.65]That's kind of the idea.
[16:25.43]I have like four costumes here.
[16:29.52]It's going to be fucking impossible.
[16:30.80]I'm going to be like purple at the end of this.
[16:44.24]Everyone's super.
[16:50.35]Every superhero's super.
[16:54.03]But some are more super than others.
[17:05.01]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[17:13.03]battles, adventure, breathtaking effects.
[17:20.78]Not a silly costume in sight.
[17:24.38]Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[17:29.16]Rippling muscles.
[17:32.16]Astounding abilities.
[17:34.84]Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[17:38.37]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[17:43.56]faster than waiting for a bus.
[17:49.58]So when you're feeling low, remember, everyone's super.
[17:59.88]No, I don't want to replay that.
[18:01.60]Why did I have to be red?
[18:04.80]Okay.
[18:07.66]No, I don't.
[18:09.54]Would you like to save your movie?
[18:10.92]No.
[18:11.30]Why would I want to save this fucking movie?
[18:16.18]That was awful.
[18:17.64]Save it.
[18:22.46]Who cares?
[18:23.68]Who cares?
[18:32.01]That was a test.
[18:33.57]I was testing the program for that one.
[18:35.59]To make sure it worked.

[19:39.88]This takes a long time, damn.
[19:45.45]He's testing the lighting in the room.

[22:40.29]Thank you.
[22:41.01]Thank you so much, everybody.
[22:43.67]I'm glad everybody liked the trailer.
[22:45.77]The movie ain't out yet.

[22:49.64]But I really appreciate the support nonetheless.
[22:52.06]Make sure to go see it next year when it comes out.
[22:55.04]Have a great evening.
[22:56.70]Make sure to tip your waiters and waitresses.
[23:00.34]And I'm out.
[23:14.36]Let's check our equipment is working correctly.
[23:21.59]Is the picture in focus?
[23:36.18]Can't hear me
[24:04.47]I'm saying that the sun is beaming in here.
[24:11.24]I gotta turn the music down.
[24:12.62]Thanks for the reminder.
[24:13.90]Alright, live looks fine.
[24:16.38]Now, let's position the camera.
[24:18.76]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline without appearing too small.
[24:23.83]People will do like a thing.
[24:25.03]Oh, look, the thing on the ground over there is six feet tall.

[46:07.59]Is the lighting okay in here?
[46:09.23]Check the light meter to be sure.
[46:11.65]The light is fine.
[46:21.50]I bought this.
[46:22.62]This is a Philips Hue, sits on the table, coffee table, dumb fucking pretend bowl light.
[46:28.75]I got this like two years ago.
[46:30.79]Just about, like a year ago maybe.
[46:33.37]I've not used it once.
[46:34.61]This is the only time I've ever turned it on.
[46:36.05]Because I don't know what to do with it.
[46:38.23]So I'm going to add some light here.
[46:45.57]The bar went down.
[46:46.99]Alright, okay.
[46:49.17]What do I do with this though?
[46:53.31]I can make it a different color too.
[46:55.23]I wish I could show you.
[46:55.89]Put it on the bright side.
[46:59.18]Is that gonna help?
[47:04.86]Is it helping?
[47:07.50]What's this thing, what is it even for?
[47:09.12]Why did I buy that?
[47:09.74]It was like 70 bucks.
[47:12.71]Now, let's position the camera.
[47:15.10]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.
[47:18.14]I felt like, ooh, if we sit on the coffee table and I can make it like a nice warm hue.
[47:21.36]If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in, tell the camera I put down and try again.
[47:33.21]Welcome to the cutout studio.
[47:35.33]This is where we separate your.
[47:37.01]Hopefully they get my fucking.
[47:38.53]I need to get like a light pin.

[47:43.72]Please, hold on.
[47:46.42]Cutout complete.
[47:48.50]Now, get back in front of the camera.
[47:50.58]I need, like, red paint.
[47:51.48]Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best results.
[47:55.94]Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[47:59.29]Four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four.
[48:05.35]Okay, four, but that's a little... Can't you, like, see the, uh... You can see the outline, though.
[48:15.20]I don't like being able to see the outline.
[48:17.12]It's just like, it's pretend.
[48:24.74]Four is bad luck.
[48:25.44]Better than two.
[48:26.30]What about three?
[48:26.96]Alright, I'm just gonna sit right here and I'm not gonna move from like here.
[48:31.54]Ready?
[48:38.84]One looks alright.
[48:40.59]One looks okay.
[48:42.90]Three's too wiggly.
[48:44.42]And four has like a big halo around it.
[48:50.48]One's okay.
[49:00.96]My arms are fucked.
[49:06.24]I'll try four for one of these.
[49:15.54]I mean, I'm gonna be, like, glowing, but whatever.
[49:18.04]Is it worth it?
[49:18.46]No, I ain't doing it.
[49:21.42]I'm doing three.
[49:22.12]We're sticking with three.
[49:34.61]One.
[49:36.79]How many actors are there?
[49:38.74]Choose the correct number.
[49:50.97]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[49:54.53]This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[50:00.65]If the picture is okay, press A to continue.
[50:04.96]This is just emo slots.
[50:09.22]Oh, she's like, Jermaild one.
[50:11.22]Oh look, Jermaild one, Jermaild two, Jermaild three, Jermaild four.
[50:20.97]I don't even know who's gonna be who.

[131:11.01]Alright, here we go.
[131:16.71]Shh.
[131:28.07]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[131:33.64]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[131:46.70]A little romance, excitement, and security is what we're all looking for.
[132:03.19]And if it doesn't work out, we try again.
[132:06.90]And again.
[132:08.36]But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.
[132:35.17]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[132:39.82]When he opens the door and he's naked, he's just naked.
[132:50.00]I need to see it again.
[132:51.54]I'm going to be quiet for this one.
[133:02.44]I'm going to try.
[133:14.91]The whole dancing thing still makes no sense to me.
[133:17.47]That's like a full two minutes of acting.
[133:21.95]Sorry.
[133:30.40]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[133:35.94]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[133:48.99]A little romance, excitement, and security is what we're all looking for.
[134:05.43]And if it doesn't work out, we try again.
[134:12.95]And again.
[134:28.02]But sometimes, the right one for you is closer than you think.
[134:37.48]Watch close to your heart, because love is never far away.
[134:42.12]Oh my god.
[134:49.37]I kind of have to.
[134:54.45]That was fucking ridiculous.
[134:58.85]Thieves still at large.
[135:01.26]Why do they all keep getting arrested?
[135:05.34]Bro, the bar is closing on him.
[135:09.88]Oh my goodness.
[135:12.09]I gotta go get Iceman.
[135:13.03]I gotta fucking take a break after this one.
[135:16.37]That was fucking so stupid.
[135:25.44]What website was that?
[135:26.54]And the fact that there's a scene where there's just two fat...
[135:32.56]fat suit people at a club or something.
[135:34.80]Like, what?
[135:36.84]It doesn't make any sense.
[135:37.58]Did I fuck something up?
[135:38.58]I think I screwed something up.
[135:41.78]It's the same person.
[135:44.08]I'm just gonna call it love story.
[135:49.74]God damn, that was fucking fun.
[135:56.06]At the very end, with pushing the cake, there's no context to any of this shit.
[136:01.21]Ugh.
[136:07.17]Alright, I'll be right back while this saves.
[136:08.69]I'm going to grab some ice.
[136:10.02]I'm going to grab some water, and I'll be right back.

[209:11.40]Time flies when you're having fun, you know?
[209:12.78]I'm gonna rewind myself.

[210:04.97]You want to know if you're of the age of 30 and you can drink.
[210:09.49]Shot of vodka.

[210:14.15]Little more than half I fucked it up.
[210:18.95]Half pineapple juice.
[210:20.49]It's a bayberry.
[210:26.90]I've ruined it.
[210:27.44]How about vodka cranberries?
[210:30.50]Yes, I know.
[210:30.94]I know the hair just came down to the perfect spot.
[210:33.68]Vodka cranberry and vodka pineapple are two timeless drinks.
[210:39.92]This is a bayberry's.
[210:42.13]Is the lighting okay in here?

[211:07.83]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.
[211:10.99]He's drunk at 5 o'clock.
[211:12.09]These are baby breezes.
[211:14.29]I'm not drinking straight vodka.
[211:16.91]It's like a half a shot.
[211:19.73]I can drink like 10 of these and sing.
[211:27.72]I could sing the entire alphabet.
[211:31.96]Welcome to the cutout studio.
[211:34.08]This is where we separate your image from the background.
[211:37.74]Select start cutout studio to continue.
[211:41.35]You would sing.
[211:42.07]Okay.
[211:45.73]I'll tell you, I'm not drunk at all.
[211:47.21]I'll sing to prove it.
[211:48.45]Like, okay, weirdo.
[211:52.37]Great.
[211:53.39]Please move out of the video.

[212:00.95]Three always works the best.
[212:02.27]Three and two.
[212:03.47]Two seems to work out.
[212:04.25]I don't like the haze from four, even though I think four gets everything.
[212:08.39]I'll do, uh, I'll do three.
[212:09.33]Three's alright.
[212:10.27]Two.
[212:29.16]The problem is like the sun is starting to set.
[212:31.22]Kind of looks like shit.
[212:37.96]Welcome to the cutout studio.
[212:40.08]This is where we separate your image from the background.

[213:08.16]Alright.
[213:10.42]Choose the correct number.
[213:11.92]I don't think I've done it before.

[248:20.48]What a... that... was... amazing!
[248:24.38]Those bags won't be back around for a while.
[248:27.20]That's so much easier than putting on another fucking costume.
[248:29.56]Player two, to the set!

[248:55.33]Woohoo!
[249:09.75]I'm having so much fun with this one.

[249:18.08]We don't ever use this footage.

[249:22.64]Nice act, dude.
[249:24.08]There's no footage that's being taken from this game.

[249:31.67]I like the paintwork.
[249:38.13]Have you got a license for that thing?
[249:40.01]I do.
[249:41.31]Houston, we have liftoff.
[249:43.16]Still technically the bicycles here don't need a license.
[249:48.64]With a little practice, you could be a great stuntman.
[249:51.18]That was a lot of fun.
[249:52.34]Glad I did that whole fucking thing.
[249:53.74]That's not going to be in the movie at all.
[249:59.57]Player three, get your butt on the set.

[250:37.50]Do you know kung fu?
[250:40.40]Now that must have hurt.
[250:42.51]A lot.
[250:44.53]That's gonna hurt tomorrow.
[250:51.28]You're supposed to dodge.
[250:55.12]You gain the beating.
[250:59.18]Bullseye!
[251:00.22]Take that, dummy head.
[251:04.21]Nice hair.
[251:05.19]Take that, dummy.

[329:33.07]That's just in my mouth forever.
[329:35.43]Player two, I need you on set, please.
[329:43.26]It's time to put you in the spotlight.
[329:46.18]Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[329:49.48]Oh, what did I do?
[329:50.58]No, this was a guy.
[329:51.48]This was a guy.
[329:59.63]More feeling.
[330:01.11]Put more feeling into it.
[330:06.90]You brought the house down.
[330:08.66]Beautiful.
[330:13.48]Player three, to the set.
[330:21.95]It's time to put you in the spotlight.
[330:24.83]There's no scoring.
[330:26.09]Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[330:31.73]Look up to the sky as if you've just seen a flying pig.
[330:38.14]Action.
[330:40.72]Come on.
[330:41.64]Show me what you got.
[330:46.50]You brought the house down.
[330:47.82]Beautiful.
[330:52.98]Player one, get yourself to the set.
[330:54.96]Oh, my God, this is a lot.
[330:57.54]Ooh, don't break the Philips Hue.
[330:59.26]That was $70.
[331:02.76]It's time to put you in the spotlight.
[331:05.64]There's no scoring.
[331:06.88]Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[331:12.09]Give me your most shocked expression.
[331:19.01]Action.
[331:21.65]Alright.
[331:25.40]He's got yellow teeth?
[331:27.06]What?
[331:51.99]Well done, people!
[331:53.10]That's it!
[331:53.34]That's a wrap!
[331:54.50]That's the final one!
[331:55.66]Alright, get me out of this suit!
[332:08.43]Here's the last one of the night.
[332:29.97]spiders from space no one could have dreamt such an eerie event could occur here on our own planet Earth but they came they fed
[333:02.95]They spun their meticulous webs!
[333:06.59]Run for your lives!
[333:08.43]They're freakish!
[333:32.49]They're brutish.
[333:37.23]They're certainly fursuit.
[333:45.71]They're spiders from space.
[333:57.76]Where was the eating thing?
[334:02.08]You can tell, like, where these are going.
[334:06.45]It started, like, the first, like, seven were like, wow, I'm, like, really into it.
[334:09.93]And, like, these last ones have been just so phoned in.
[334:14.37]The last two especially.
[334:17.32]They didn't even use the footage of me eating all the fucking stuffing.
[334:22.32]Alright, we're gonna watch them all.
[334:23.92]I'm gonna save it.
[334:33.28]Maybe when they're saved, they won't lag.
[334:44.73]Oh my goodness, that was fucking fun.
[334:48.09]That was absolutely worth playing.
[334:49.75]That was worth buying a 360 and an Xbox Live Vision camera.
[334:56.01]So...
[334:57.66]best part about having a 360 still after this because I bought it for this game I bought a connect and I bought about 30 to 40 games there's gonna be a week maybe two weeks worth of connect games I got so many oh yeah I got connect Star Wars absolutely
[335:28.98]Every Kinect game you can think of that you think is worth playing, I have it.
[335:36.08]Restart the console?
[335:36.90]Yeah, I'll do that too.
[335:40.63]I'm going to Red Ring this Xbox.
[335:45.61]Did I get Twister?
[335:46.43]Yes, I did.
[335:59.70]No Kinect games are worth playing.
[336:03.09]That's true.
[336:06.17]Well, some of them are.
[336:09.99]I think there's at least a handful that might be worth playing.
[336:21.34]Star Wars Kinect Dancing.
[336:24.02]I don't think I have that one.
[336:29.30]Connectable?
[336:30.26]Connectimals, yes, I have that too.
[336:39.92]That's the only good one.
[336:47.65]So we will go through, I'm going to assume, I wanted a whole stream for this game because obviously I felt like there was a lot to explore, and there was.
[336:58.69]I do have Rise of Nightmares.
[336:59.93]I also have Hunt.
[337:13.26]Yeah, I got them all.
[337:13.90]Alright, let's take... I'm going to restart the 360.
[337:25.97]Should have about 11 or 12 to watch start to finish.
[337:37.76]Here we go.
[337:44.05]I am tired.
[337:48.03]I didn't think this game was going to take it out of me that much.
[337:50.41]But it did.
[337:51.25]I think it was the change in clothes every 15 seconds.
[337:54.42]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.
[338:04.31]And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.
[338:08.71]The nominees for Best Actor are... Nominee 1.
[338:18.44]Nominee two.
[338:20.31]Arm, face, arm, and arm.
[338:23.03]Nominee three.
[338:24.15]Is it the constant standing?
[338:27.47]No, I think it was more of the... Nominee four.
[338:29.15]There's probably a combination of everything.
[338:31.78]But of course, there can only be one winner.
[338:36.98]And the You're in the Movies Award for Best Actor goes to... Which one is that?
[338:49.57]Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award.
[338:53.47]Perhaps you'd like to say a few words I'm so tired.
[339:11.58]I am trashed right now.
[339:13.62]Not even alcohol.
[339:14.74]I'm just saying I'm out
[339:20.98]I feel like I want to do these at some other point.
[339:27.44]There's like six or seven more that I think I want to do.
[339:32.13]Steal the day.
[339:38.01]Some of these look fun.
[339:40.33]But, let's go to...
[339:46.43]I'm gonna restart the console.
[339:55.16]This thing is on fire.
[339:59.80]Wow.
[340:01.56]This thing is burning up.
[340:05.93]Whoa, easy!
[340:06.93]What the fuck are you doing?
[340:11.67]It just spit the disk at me.
[340:12.87]I didn't do anything.
[340:17.36]I would say this is probably like 250 degrees.
[340:21.04]If I were to take a guess.
[340:23.06]Inside of here, if I touched inside of here, I would burn my hand.
[340:25.48]I would have to go to the hospital.
[340:26.66]If I put my finger inside of this unit.
[340:31.73]Okay, restarting.
[340:38.93]And here we go.
[340:42.09]I wonder what the bottom of this feels like.
[340:50.43]sucks yeah and so earlier today it was it was over probably 100 105 here in Vegas so probably not the best environment for an old 360 but this is one of the newer models this is one of the slim ones they can handle it right okay here we go
[341:30.99]Alright.
[341:33.25]The slim models had overheating problems?
[341:36.03]Uh-oh.
[341:38.71]How bad?
[341:47.07]Welcome to You're in the Movies!
[341:49.65]The game that makes you... Alright, we're gonna watch them start to finish.
[342:02.46]Alright, we're gonna do, this is Who Cares.
[342:04.22]No, no, no, no, that might be, no, we're gonna do Who Cares 2.
[342:07.80]You ready?
[342:15.01]Who Cares?
[342:19.73]Everyone's super.
[342:25.81]Every superhero's super.
[342:29.48]But some are more super than others.
[342:40.29]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[342:48.32]Battles, adventure, breathtaking effects.
[342:56.03]Not a silly costume in sight.
[342:59.68]Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[343:04.34]Rippling muscles.
[343:07.32]Astounding abilities.
[343:10.02]Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[343:13.49]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[343:18.61]Faster than waiting for a bus.
[343:24.65]So when you're feeling low, remember, everyone's super.
[343:35.21]Well, that was the first one and it was dog shit.
[343:38.88]Here's Who Cares 3.
[343:40.08]I don't remember which one this one was.
[343:48.96]It was a day like any other day.
[343:53.66]Until a terrible accident Created a horrifying atomic monster Cold-blooded Watch in terror as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc I'm trying to dodge the laser Created by nature Twisted by science
[344:21.44]No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it.
[344:29.18]Can anything stop this Leviathan?
[344:34.41]Can mankind use science to fight nature with nature?
[344:40.73]Feel your blood run cold.
[344:46.89]Cold-blooded.
[344:51.32]Okay, that one actually sucked.
[344:56.48]That one was just stupid.
[344:59.70]The lizard was the best character in that whole trailer.
[345:02.17]It wasn't me.
[345:07.97]Here's Mimi and me.
[345:12.93]Me, me, and me.
[345:17.41]Today is a day you'll never forget.
[345:25.44]Somewhere, at some point in time, in a secret location, the boundaries of science are being stretched beyond breaking point.
[345:42.25]Through the miracle of science, you could find yourself becoming more.
[345:54.18]Much more.
[345:57.05]Loads more.
[345:59.43]And then some.
[346:02.37]So, when you're in a pickle, there's only one person you can count on.
[346:08.29]You, and you, and you.
[346:11.76]The thing, the algorithm making everybody fat is just fucking too funny.
[346:20.84]Oh, man.
[346:27.03]Here comes the murder mansion.
[346:32.19]Dial M for a menu.
[346:35.45]Today's meal is murder.
[346:42.30]There's plenty to eat when murder's on the menu.
[346:48.20]Murder at the mansion.
[346:50.98]Everyone has a motive.
[346:59.90]Everyone has a secret.
[347:04.55]Everyone is a suspect.
[347:13.43]Who has the last laugh when a joke goes too far?
[347:18.40]But who is to blame?
[347:20.18]Who is guilty of
[347:29.32]murder at the mansion no I would not like to see it again this one I think is my favorite I think love story is my favorite there's so much going on in this one I love all of them equally but I think this one might be the best one just because it's all over the place
[347:59.85]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[348:04.71]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[348:07.67]A little romance, excitement, and security is what we're all looking for.
[348:30.48]and if it doesn't work out we try again and again but sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think
[348:57.79]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[349:06.71]That's my favorite.
[349:07.63]I love that one.
[349:10.90]The best part is the picture of the naked fat guy, right?
[349:14.68]That's your picture.
[349:17.56]That's what you have for a photo and then show up naked too.
[349:23.61]at the front door and it's like that.
[349:25.33]Oh my God, wow, you're so, so dashing.
[349:33.63]This is the Private Eye one.
[349:35.07]I think this one was pretty good too.
[349:41.70]Private Eye.
[349:47.06]It was a quiet day for crime.
[349:50.77]Then bad news walked in.
[349:57.79]Everyone wants to play the field.
[350:03.82]And no one wants to get caught.
[350:08.14]Love can make us do terrible things.
[350:11.70]Diabolical dancing.
[350:14.58]Sensational scandal.
[350:18.34]Most people want one of two things, love or money.
[350:27.21]Some want both.
[350:31.63]Before you act on your suspicions, get yourself some proof.
[350:37.11]Get yourself a private eye.
[350:46.59]Okay, so the first, my favorite part is the first scene.
[350:51.47]The private eye is sitting there and the door opens.
[350:53.51]He's crying before somebody like a customer comes in and he has to shape up real quick.
[351:01.10]One more.
[351:02.06]I can see that again.
[351:03.42]Private eye.
[351:08.76]It was a quiet day for crime.
[351:12.48]Then bad news walked in.
[351:19.49]Everyone wants to play the field.
[351:25.49]And no one wants to get caught.
[351:29.85]Love can make us do terrible things.
[351:33.39]Diabolical dancing.
[351:36.27]Sensational scandal.
[351:40.05]Most people want one of two things.
[351:42.88]Love or money.
[351:48.93]some want both before you act on your suspicions get yourself some proof get yourself a private eye I mean that's kind of bad like back to back these are like just I can't pick one I can't pick which one is better
[352:14.59]I think it ha- it's probably a love story though, it's just pretty good.
[352:17.49]Let me say it again.
[352:18.41]I'll just say it one more time and then we'll move on.
[352:22.76]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[352:27.64]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[352:30.90]A little romance, excitement, and security
[352:44.32]is what we're all looking for and if it doesn't work out we try again and again
[353:12.32]But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.
[353:20.70]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[353:25.95]It's like a computer put it together.
[353:28.13]It's like just stock footage in a computer.
[353:40.30]God.
[353:45.29]The computer did put it together.
[353:46.45]Yeah, that's true.
[353:47.51]But this is the dinosaur one.
[353:49.37]These next three are fucking horrible.
[353:51.67]But we're going to watch them anyways.
[353:55.44]It's like talk to Transformer.
[353:59.70]It started with a meeting of great minds.
[354:07.61]And a plan to travel to a lost world.
[354:13.81]Journey to a land never beheld by man, woman, nor child.
[354:20.81]Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before.
[354:26.25]Prehistoric Paradise.
[354:32.29]Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities.
[354:36.31]Groundbreaking discoveries.
[354:39.68]Enormous eggs.
[354:47.48]Terrifying monsters!
[354:51.05]Older than your dreams, scarier than your nightmares!
[354:56.83]A daring rescue mission!
[354:59.40]Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is Prehistoric Paradise.
[355:05.70]It's like your actor was so bad that they just got like drunk on set every day and they didn't even do their lines.
[355:14.27]So you had to piece something together.
[355:15.71]What?
[355:16.85]You already were halfway through making the whole movie.
[355:25.42]Vampire.
[355:25.96]I don't remember Vampire.
[355:27.00]I don't even remember this one.
[355:30.25]Oh yeah, the Scooby Doo run.
[355:31.79]This one is the most coherent, I think.
[355:34.01]It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.
[355:39.24]It turned into a holiday from hell.
[355:45.74]Gaze in horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night.
[355:51.88]This is the vacation to end all vacations.
[355:57.48]You won't be able to leave.
[356:02.61]Will anyone hear you scream?
[356:08.61]There's loads of excitement.
[356:12.33]But be sure not to lose your head.
[356:23.35]Have your friends for dinner.
[356:26.11]Literally.
[356:37.67]So, if you feel the life being sucked out of you, it's time for a vampiric vacation.
[356:53.40]I like this one, but I like one part.
[356:55.28]There's only one part I like.
[356:56.12]When they're at the dinner table, and the robe guy has a wine glass in his hand, and he's just over-animated and over-enunciating.
[357:06.15]I just want to see it one more time.
[357:08.73]It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.
[357:13.95]It turned into a holiday from hell.
[357:18.87]Watch the dinner.
[357:20.45]gaze upon the bizarre creatures of the night.
[357:26.61]This is the vacation to end all vacations.
[357:32.19]You won't be able to leave.
[357:37.32]Will anyone hear you scream?
[357:43.32]There's loads of excitement.
[357:46.24]But be sure not to lose your head.
[357:58.10]have your friends for dinner.
[358:00.84]Literally.
[358:12.39]So, if you feel the life being sucked out of you, it's time for a vampiric vacation.
[358:28.02]alright oh yeah yeah uh witnesses oh this is the one with this one with shido this oh this one's eating this is the eating oh I love this one this one actually might be my favorite it's hot it's tough because it's so scared witness there are no perfect crimes
[358:58.27]And when you're the only witness, danger lurks around every corner.
[359:10.60]It's a deadly game when you are running for your life.
[359:19.72]Hiding a secret that nobody knows.
[359:26.84]Chased.
[359:29.65]Hunted.
[359:32.91]Excitement lies dead ahead.
[359:38.73]Jeopardy awaits impending peril.
[359:46.92]Where would you go if you over there?
[359:51.24]Yes, you were scared witness.
[360:03.54]And then I did an even better one.
[360:05.10]And this next one, when I stuffed the whole thing in my mouth, and they didn't even use it.
[360:08.30]They didn't even use any of it.
[360:11.10]Deity.
[360:12.76]Oh, right.
[360:13.62]The book one.
[360:21.65]Deity for a day.
[360:27.30]Feeling washed up.
[360:31.22]Life got you beat.
[360:37.59]Seeing things again?
[360:39.93]Why not get away?
[360:44.99]And lose yourself in Paradise.
[360:56.09]Meet new friends.
[361:00.25]Dance with the natives.
[361:02.88]Eat fantastic feasts.
[361:06.31]And if you ever get homesick, a warm welcome awaits you.
[361:11.79]Deity for a day.
[361:24.59]Will you ever tire of being admired?
[361:38.93]This is the one that was just... I was done.
[361:41.27]I was done.
[361:42.35]I was done doing this.
[361:46.89]God.
[361:55.14]The last one is Spider.
[362:01.70]When did the book just come out of my nose?
[362:04.64]When did that even happen?
[362:05.64]No one could have dreamt.
[362:08.23]Such an eerie event could occur.
[362:13.65]Here, on our own planet Earth.
[362:17.76]But they came.
[362:20.40]They fed.
[362:27.96]They spun their meticulous webs.
[362:34.84]Run for your lives!
[362:39.09]They're freakish.
[362:44.92]They're brutish.
[362:48.04]They're certainly Hairsuit.
[362:50.78]They're spiders from space.
[363:16.64]Oh my god.
[363:22.49]Who cares one?
[363:28.03]I think it's just the superhero one.
[363:31.44]But I might be naked.
[363:33.16]Let me see.
[363:47.09]Three superheroes super.
[363:50.59]But some are more super than others.
[364:01.28]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[364:05.46]I don't think I've been in this for more than a second.
[364:07.48]Yeah, I tested it.
[364:09.96]I think I'm only in two machines.
[364:12.74]Breathtaking effects.
[364:16.87]Not a silly costume in sight.
[364:20.47]Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[364:25.14]Rippling muscles.
[364:28.12]Astounding abilities.
[364:30.76]Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[364:34.12]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[364:39.24]Faster than waiting for a bus.
[364:45.21]So when you're feeling low, remember, everyone's super.
[364:51.22]From yesterday, I'm sorry.
[364:53.54]No, what you're looking at here is you're looking at something I did at least two days ago.
[365:00.12]Yes, so this was the 17th.
[365:04.79]So this was like two or three days ago, yeah.
[365:09.45]I told you I was in it.
[365:10.49]What am I gonna, this shirt was clean.
[365:12.23]Am I gonna wash the shirt?
[365:13.41]I put it on for five seconds.
[365:17.15]I put this shirt on, did the test, and was like, I'm ready to stream, and I couldn't stream.
[365:20.98]So then I just took off the shirt, and I went back to bed.
[365:23.14]I didn't go to bed, but I, like, I don't know, but I did something.
[365:27.78]This shirt's all dirty.
[365:28.62]It's dirty now.
[365:29.48]Oh, absolutely.
[365:30.78]You better believe it.
[365:34.75]Just upload it.
[365:36.93]Ah, well, that was fucking really, really fun.
[365:38.99]That was really fun.
[365:41.59]Ah, yeah, I'm still on camera, aren't I?
[365:43.25]Ugh.
[365:48.39]I put the shirt on for literally 20 minutes.
[365:53.63]No, I wasn't throwing up a high batted smell.
[365:55.39]That was the robe.
[365:57.53]That was the robe.
[365:59.43]It's this thing.
[366:00.89]Look at how dark it is in here now.
[366:06.55]It was this.
[366:07.55]That's what you were smelling.
[366:08.61]And that's what I was smelling, but that's what I was relaying to you.
[366:15.89]E, that's the E3 striat, that is the E3 striat.
[366:20.02]Oh man, does anybody have the boogers coming out of my nose?
[366:23.88]I kinda wanna see it.
[366:24.74]Let me turn this down.
[366:27.24]Does anybody have like the snot coming out of my nose?
[366:36.50]Right there?
[366:38.10]Is that it?
[366:38.54]Is that actually it?
[366:40.74]I wanna see if this actually happens.
[366:47.58]Can you actually see this?
[366:53.72]I look tired.
[366:54.30]I don't think you can see it.
[367:18.64]Nah, thank God this camera's like 140p.
[367:22.66]Perfect.
[367:22.98]You can't see shit.
[367:25.44]Look at that forehead shine.
[367:26.54]Well, I mean, I've been running around in a circle in my room for six hours.
[367:29.86]Well, five and a half.
[367:30.54]Alright, I'm gonna call it here.
[367:35.50]Thank you for joining me.
[367:36.64]That was You're in the Movies.
[367:41.80]That was a lot of fun.
[367:43.92]That was way more fun than I really thought about.
[367:45.80]I just, I saw it and I had to get it, had to play it.
[367:49.53]Hope you had fun.
[367:52.02]So what we're going to do now is we're going to do the bits, but we're going to start with the bits that I missed a couple days ago, three days ago.
[368:01.02]So we're just going to chill and we're going to go through them.
[368:05.74]Just going to relax and play.
[368:08.42]Nothing.
[368:09.48]Maybe I should just stay on camera.
[368:11.86]I don't know.
[368:13.00]No, the Xbox is going to like fucking explode.
[368:15.64]I'm going to turn it off.
[368:22.28]I feel like this thing is going to burn out.
[368:27.01]Can I just go like this?
[368:31.07]Nice face cam.
[368:38.00]Hold on.
[368:39.76]You can hear the Xbox dying.
[368:41.48]You probably can.
[368:44.90]I just want the square.
[368:49.49]What if I don't move?
[369:12.63]I'm just going to have to go like this.
[369:18.45]Hey, there you go.
[369:19.11]I'll just hang out and go to the other screen.
[369:24.13]Is the picture in focus?
[369:25.13]I mean, sure it is.
[369:30.19]I guess I can just hit back, right?
[369:31.53]Yeah.
[369:34.07]Alright, if you're going to take off, we'll see you tomorrow.
[369:36.97]I have no idea what's going on tomorrow.
[369:38.21]I know there's some stuff that is possible.
[369:40.57]I wonder if Star's computer works.
[369:43.91]Star's computer was all screwed up or something.
[369:45.57]His power supply was fucked up.
[369:48.74]There are... There are like 30 dead pixels on this webcam.
[369:57.52]Oh my god, I burnt it out.
[369:58.88]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[370:07.30]You can find like Orion's belt in this thing.
[370:11.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[370:20.17]Wow.
[370:21.17]That's unbelievable.
[370:22.05]This thing really is a piece of shit, isn't it?
[370:29.13]Whatever.
[370:29.47]Not like I'm going to use it ever again.
[370:30.93]Unless I play this.
[370:32.33]But I do have a second one because I bought two accidentally.
[370:38.00]much was the Xbox camera it here's what I didn't know uh you're in the movies comes with one of those I did not know that so I bought one of those separately and it's sealed in a clamshell box I didn't know you got one when you bought it so it didn't say that on the list unfortunately so I have a second fresh ones maybe I'll plug the freshman in like six months we'll do it again
[371:05.13]sell it on eBay?
[371:07.05]No, I want to keep it.
[371:08.83]I want to keep it forever.
[371:11.10]Alright, let's do the bits.
[371:11.98]Let's actually get this open.
[371:18.07]So these are from a few days ago.
[371:19.35]We're going to go through them very quickly.
[371:23.43]At least quick enough where we can head to the other ones too.
[371:25.39]Because I don't want to be too late tonight.
[371:27.65]Because this is a good place to kind of stop.
[371:29.74]And this is what I want to have happen in the future as well.
[371:33.04]Those of you that have been around just hanging out for the last maybe couple weeks or so.
[371:39.08]Once or twice I have talked about bits on the beach.
[371:42.68]Oh yeah, I guess I could just do this, couldn't I?
[371:48.27]Oh, watch this.
[371:48.85]Ready?
[371:49.73]We'll just have some random shit in the background.
[372:00.48]Ready?
[372:01.30]Watch this.
[372:04.90]Zits on the beach.
[372:08.12]That's one.
[372:08.84]There's one.
[372:09.82]It's hot in here.
[372:10.40]Alright.
[372:29.91]Uh, let's get to the bits from a few days ago.
[372:46.12]Watch out for that monkey behind me.
[372:47.43]Where is he?
[372:48.97]Oh, that's a lion.
[372:50.73]It was a monkey.
[372:53.55]Okay, so from a few days ago...
[372:57.79]I'm going to put these over here, actually, so I can see them better.
[373:02.48]We had a new piece of artwork from Yen Wen, which I want to show on screen.
[373:09.48]Because it was insane.
[373:11.85]Yen Wen's artwork is more detailed than my own face.
[373:18.27]Let me get it here.
[373:22.25]Take a look at this.
[373:28.96]You've seen it?
[373:29.42]Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[373:30.88]There's more detail than my actual face.
[373:37.84]It's the chin one.
[373:39.26]Yeah, look at this.
[373:46.97]This shit is so fucking funny.
[373:53.31]Yeah, nice pic.
[373:54.07]I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
[373:56.13]I'm gonna VPN it.
[373:59.54]The VPN I use takes like an extra five to 10 seconds to open like any websites.
[374:03.02]Alright, here we go.
[374:16.61]Why am I in a VPN?
[374:18.23]Because my internet sucks and routing traffic somewhere else actually helps with my packet loss because my internet's a piece of shit.
[374:27.15]But look at that.
[374:34.70]That's from a few days ago.
[374:38.72]I have to shave too.
[374:41.75]Look at what like two days does.
[374:48.69]Make it an emote.
[374:49.91]You look like Nightcrawler.
[374:53.05]Nightcrawler?
[374:55.78]Like Jake Gyllenhaal Nightcrawler?
[374:58.60]Or like Ghost Through Walls Nightcrawler?
[375:08.99]Now that's amazing.
[375:12.99]Both.
[375:16.41]But thank you, Yen Wen, for that.
[375:17.78]It's fucking fantastic.
[375:23.22]It's a Jim Carrey, Willem Dafoe.
[375:24.82]I'm like losing my face here.
[375:27.02]Slowly.
[375:27.94]It's deciding it doesn't like where I am.
[375:32.34]But no, that's insanely talented.
[375:34.96]There's so many artworks that Yen Win has done that are just ridiculous.
[375:41.59]And there's also a couple of clown car emotes.
[375:48.16]Might as well put this one on screen because it's fucking funny.
[375:58.82]Please shave, take a break, and a hot bath.
[376:01.24]You look stressed and not well.
[376:10.50]I'm alright.
[376:12.70]I'm fine.
[376:13.54]What are you talking about?
[376:14.34]I'm alright.
[376:14.62]I mean, I'm 33.
[376:18.18]This is just what you look like when you're 33.
[376:19.56]I'm not 23.
[376:20.00]I'm 33.
[376:21.57]This is just what you look like this.
[376:30.17]I'm doing just fine.
[376:34.51]And I've been jumping around in my room.
[376:36.25]They're telling you to take a shower.
[376:39.30]Oh, I'm going to.
[376:39.94]You better believe it when this is done.
[376:44.62]But let's put this on the screen.
[376:51.38]Where is it?
[376:58.88]Come on.
[376:59.30]Get over there.
[377:08.40]It keeps up with the roller coaster pretty well.
[377:16.04]I gotta like put the new shit that Bloordao did on this stream.
[377:20.22]I've been so busy I haven't been able to do it.
[377:29.43]It's really good.
[377:35.05]Yeah, there's, like, two or three things that he's done that are done.
[377:37.89]And I just haven't put them on.
[377:39.19]Because I just haven't had... I just have been too busy to, like, put it all up and set it all up.
[377:45.02]I've had him for, like, at least a couple weeks.
[377:49.22]I'm still... I keep disappearing.
[377:53.12]But thank you, Yanwen.
[377:53.94]This is fucking fantastic, as always.
[377:56.38]We also had 250 from Farildo.
[377:59.31]Ah, Dungeon Keeper is, um... Didn't they remake Dungeon Keeper, but it was a terrible game?
[378:02.25]Didn't they, like, redo it and people hated it?
[378:04.73]Because it wasn't, like, true to the old games or something?
[378:29.58]Yeah, the remake sucks.
[378:31.74]That's too bad.
[378:33.94]But probably not.
[378:34.64]Probably not Dungeon Keeper.
[378:36.78]Unless it was something that... Unless I've ran out of more stuff.
[378:40.38]Because I have a lot of stuff that's coming that I want to do.
[378:43.32]It was a microtransaction nightmare.
[378:46.43]That's unfortunate.
[378:49.04]thank you for real though uh thank you squald easy for the three bucks hey Jerma the other day I donated two dollars to Etalyx and he made fun of me for being poor will you cheer me up by saying the funny word which one got lots of funny words which funny word I said I said that s word like 10 times today I think you heard it Peter

[380:19.25]That's not a recommendation.
[380:20.39]That's a demand.

[380:27.26]I've been recommending demands to you.
[380:34.69]Streamer on demand.

[380:43.90]There's documented evidence that marijuana is good for the human body.
[380:46.90]Says a 34-year-old stoner that plays video games for money.
[380:52.89]There's documented fucking medical evidence that marijuana, like, does good things for you.
[380:57.66]If you have different, like, conditions.
[380:59.10]I didn't... That's true.
[381:03.96]That is a true statement.

[382:39.21]Change the cutout style.
[382:41.43]That's making it worse.
[382:44.42]It's really fun to see people do things to everything that happens on this channel.
[382:47.74]If somebody pulls out a clip or something that we did that was fun or something or that they thought was fun or funny and they turn it into something else, it's really interesting to see it.
[383:01.81]But no, I agree.

[387:32.53]I have so much chest pain, but I should get through it.
[387:34.87]999.
[387:37.71]Hopefully you're alright.
[387:43.78]Is that an equivalent for something like 911?
[387:48.20]Well, hopefully you're alright.
[387:49.54]Hopefully you took care of it.
[387:52.36]Fat by saying hopefully you're alright.

[388:33.59]I spent way too much time on this.
[388:48.58]How come I save things and I can't find them afterwards?
[388:51.16]I'm so stupid.
[388:53.08]Yeah, it's right there.
[389:05.31]Is it not?
[389:06.01]What did I do with it?
[389:08.21]There.
[389:08.67]OK.

[389:45.05]So I don't look completely fucked up.
[389:48.97]Ah, thank you though, CoreMonster.
[389:50.85]Good shit.
[389:51.75]Good shit.
[389:56.07]DubskyDude, thanks for the $2.50.
[389:57.81]Hey, Jerma, you should seriously consider playing Darkwood.
[390:00.59]It's one of the best horror games on Steam.
[390:03.36]On Steam, really.
[390:04.74]And it's sitting at a 93% with Steam reviews.
[390:08.18]I promise you it'll make for a perfect scare Saturday stream.
[390:11.40]Normally, I don't give people money just to recommend a game, but Darkwood is that good.
[390:17.98]Okay.
[390:18.40]Also, chat will love watching you shit your pants.
[390:22.19]Is it good?
[390:25.49]How good is it?
[390:28.59]It's good.
[390:35.09]You're doing everyone a disservice by not playing Darkwood.
[390:38.58]Really?
[390:41.02]Is it top-down?
[390:41.80]Is that a top-down game?
[390:48.08]It is.
[390:48.42]Okay, I have seen this.
[390:49.78]I might even own this.
[390:52.37]I think it was one of those things where I just bought it one day in like a Steam sale or something, maybe.
[390:58.41]Do you still use your Instagram?
[390:59.59]I don't have an Instagram.
[391:01.34]If you are looking at a Jerma985 Instagram account, it is not real.
[391:05.02]It is not a real account.
[391:06.80]I do not have one.
[391:09.92]I have a Twitter and I have a Facebook that I've never used.
[391:15.56]I don't have any of the social media accounts.
[391:26.23]Wait, what is this Jerma psycho?
[391:31.92]Why is it like, why is it blood on my chin?
[391:41.00]Facebook sucks.
[391:42.08]I haven't used it.
[391:42.90]I've made one almost 10 years ago, and I have used it maybe three or four times.
[391:52.05]Yeah, alright, let's meet a fat suit.
[391:53.70]I know, I just did it.
[391:54.82]I just was doing that for like the last six hours.
[391:59.78]What's your email?
[392:00.62]Jerma985, Jerma985, Jerma985, Jerma985, at Jerma985.Jerma985.
[392:09.59]I'm not holding a fish in my Facebook profile.
[392:11.65]I'm not.
[392:12.29]I don't have a Facebook.
[392:14.03]I don't have a, I don't use the Jerma985 Facebook.
[392:17.31]I don't do anything.
[392:22.19]I don't have a fucking Facebook.
[392:23.85]I don't have like a fish profile, whatever you're talking about.
[392:28.99]Can you repeat that?
[392:29.65]Yeah, I'll get you one more time.
[392:35.23]Rejection hotline at rejectionhotline.com.
[392:46.16]Should I make this an emote?
[392:48.48]Alright.
[392:49.06]Let me go through the bits.
[392:54.01]Let me go through the bits.
[393:02.11]I kept thinking about... Yeah, dead pixels.
[393:04.57]What are you talking about?
[393:09.77]Somebody's saying there's dead pixels.
[393:11.17]What are you... Another arm?
[393:14.24]Check your monitor, man.
[393:16.66]Your monitor seems like it might be fucked.
[393:20.18]I remember...
[393:21.87]I got a dead pixel and I bought a new computer.
[393:24.27]This is a laptop.
[393:26.16]This is probably like 12 years ago or so, probably 12 or 15 years ago.
[393:29.58]I got a new laptop and there's a dead pixel on the monitor in the laptop.
[393:34.46]And I fucking could not stand it.
[393:37.35]I lost my mind.
[393:38.91]I did the thing where you heat up a little washcloth with hot water and then you take the hot damp pad and you like massage.
[393:48.59]I gave this thing a four hour massage trying to massage out this dead pixel.
[393:56.65]It didn't work.
[393:58.25]Just like pushing and massaging and they say tap.
[394:02.03]I sat there tapping on this dead pixel for hours.
[394:08.29]It didn't do anything.
[394:09.27]And it drove me nuts.
[394:12.41]Has that ever worked for anybody, by the way?
[394:14.31]Has like tapping the dead pixel article that you get on the internet that one person tells you to do it?
[394:20.82]Has that ever worked for anybody?
[394:24.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[394:28.92]Why would that work?
[394:29.70]I guess it gets the electricity to stick in there and get in there and
[394:37.59]moving around and the crystal I don't know I have no idea should I try to fix these are those dead pixels here or those like dead pickles on on more of them appeared is that the 360. how many are there holy there's way more than I thought yeah suddenly if you take a look at the top left
[395:06.45]That's fetish up there.
[395:07.39]Oh, my God.
[395:13.33]Oh, fuck.
[395:14.17]Well, that may have just made it worse.
[395:35.09]It's broken.
[395:40.29]Hey, I'm just kidding.
[395:45.82]Now we're in focus.
[395:52.68]Okay.
[395:55.15]Where were we?
[395:56.57]I forget.
[395:57.27]Right here.
[395:58.83]Oh, Darkwood.
[395:59.43]Right.
[395:59.61]Alright.
[395:59.85]Maybe I'll try it.
[396:01.91]I don't know.
[396:02.31]I have to look into it.
[396:03.07]I have to see that because I don't... What's it on my fucking hand?
[396:10.25]What is that?
[396:10.73]That's a pimple on my hand.
[396:18.02]That's not a... What is that?
[396:22.36]That's a pimple on my hand.
[396:23.94]Can you get those?
[396:26.62]That's not a wart.
[396:33.20]I think it's irritation.
[396:36.62]That's not a wart.
[396:37.56]Look at...
[396:42.90]I think I have a zit on my hand.
[396:46.64]Oh, you know what it is?
[396:47.24]It's from resting my finger here and getting that indentation.
[396:51.22]It's not a liver spot.
[396:53.50]I'm not that old.
[396:58.20]Thank you to Aino Princess of Misery for the $5.
[397:04.29]I drew this for you, Dad.
[397:06.05]I hope you're proud of me.
[397:07.79]P.S.
[397:08.01]I hope they cast you as the Green Goblin in the new Spider-Man franchise.
[397:16.84]I'm like jacked.
[397:21.01]I could be a fucking green goblin.
[397:23.37]I swear too much though.
[397:28.21]Let's put this on.
[397:28.89]A lot of artwork.
[397:29.85]You guys are really killing it with the artwork here.
[397:39.18]Let's get it on.
[397:45.52]This is me.
[397:46.92]This is like what I actually look like with no shirt on.
[397:52.03]So you just had to call me short.
[397:58.07]It's pretty accurate to how big I am.
[398:01.55]At least in the chest area.
[398:09.73]This is not safe for work.
[398:13.31]What?
[398:15.38]It's fat.
[398:15.92]No, I got those broad shoulders.
[398:21.98]That's what my mother told me, at least.
[398:28.85]But thank you, Princess of Misery.
[398:30.51]That was very, very, very, very good shit.
[398:33.33]All the artwork has been stellar.
[398:35.69]So thank you.
[398:37.61]And Anonymous Cheer, thanks for the $2.50.
[398:38.83]That's it, just $2.50.
[398:44.43]CluelessSniper, thanks for the 250.
[398:45.61]The Jerm of that face you made inspired me to make this.
[398:51.17]I feel like I've seen this character somewhere.
[398:59.52]Right?
[399:19.28]Spider-Man!
[399:20.64]Spider-Man!
[399:21.44]Oh, that's the Green Goblin.
[399:24.50]Fucking stupid.
[399:47.72]Not bad.
[399:50.47]I think I could do it, not bad.
[399:53.39]But no, thank you for that.
[399:54.53]Are you actually a boomer?
[399:55.47]No, I'm 33.
[399:56.35]I'm still a millennial.
[399:57.41]I'm just like you.
[400:00.09]I'm just like you.
[400:01.25]I'm 33.
[400:01.51]I was born in 85.
[400:04.07]I'm a millennial.
[400:07.96]I'm not a boomer.
[400:09.24]A boomer would be, I would be Gen X or something.
[400:15.72]If I was like 83 or 82 or something.
[400:19.86]I am a millennial just like you.
[400:23.88]Or some of you guys are Zoomers.
[400:32.59]Jen Jex.
[400:36.97]Okay, we were at, that was Clueless Sniper.
[400:39.87]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for that artwork.
[400:42.52]Close number again for 250.
[400:44.14]I think this is a double message here.
[400:46.64]It is.
[400:48.54]But thank you for the goblin.
[400:49.64]The green goblin.
[400:50.46]Thanks for the $5 a few days ago.
[400:53.38]Errorless thanks for the 250.
[400:54.50]Streamer rages at in-game character.
[400:59.73]What was I playing three days ago?
[401:01.29]Oh, Metal Wolf Chaos.
[401:05.09]I beat that game.
[401:06.83]I forgot about that.
[401:07.71]It's kind of a blur.
[401:11.62]Uh, but thank you, Errolis, for the 250.
[401:12.84]Oh, right, this is right when I was in the middle of just being very upset at everything in the world, right?
[401:20.93]Manboy777, thanks for the 250.
[401:23.03]Hey, Jerma, I've been wondering, how can I be more like you?
[401:26.86]I've been cursed with incredibly thick hair, and I'm really getting tired of it.
[401:30.82]How did you get your hair so thin?
[401:42.63]Errolis, thanks for the $2.50 again.
[401:44.13]Is he still doing his old hat charade?
[401:49.53]Old hat charade?
[401:50.79]What do you mean old hat?
[401:56.77]What are we talking about?
[402:00.17]What hat charade?
[402:01.33]I'm not sure.
[402:02.23]I don't know.
[402:11.63]I don't know.
[402:13.90]You look nice today.
[402:18.19]Do you drink milk ice?
[402:19.87]Please answer.
[402:20.51]It's very important.
[402:21.37]No, I don't drink milk over ice.
[402:23.85]I don't drink milk anymore.
[402:26.25]I can't.
[402:26.95]My stomach can't handle it.
[402:28.71]My intestines can't handle it.
[402:31.14]But thank you, Pin, for the $2.50.
[402:33.50]Pin says, Hey, Jerma, I just got my acceptance letter for BYU today.
[402:38.45]hell yeah the whole process has been a surreal experience and I've spent most of this week figuring out how I'm going to live now that I'm moving away from all my friends and family it's crazy to think that in the middle in middle school you were originally just some funny TF2 youtube guy I enjoyed watching and now that's evolved into becoming one of the most consistent parts of my life and there's a part two uh first of all congrats that's fucking awesome
[403:03.84]They say, knowing that at least one part of my life is going to stay consistent in these termulous times brings me a bit of comfort.
[403:11.23]Plan on catching these streams whenever I can in between my civil engineering classes.
[403:14.95]Hope nothing but the best comes your way, pal.
[403:17.45]Same to you.
[403:18.64]Same to you.
[403:19.98]Good luck.
[403:22.32]You're going to do just fine.
[403:25.88]I'm happy anytime somebody says that they're pursuing something that they want to do.
[403:31.35]Good luck to you.
[403:33.11]BYU.
[403:36.23]That's BYU University.
[403:37.71]What?
[403:43.06]BYU does have a six-story underground library.
[403:45.80]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[403:47.38]That's a big library.
[403:55.70]He did the joke.
[403:57.00]He did the joke.
[403:57.98]Can you say Joey stinks like cheese?
[404:01.01]I just did.
[404:03.03]Just shave the first part and the last part off of that and you can...
[404:08.00]That is a Jerma985 stream reference, and I don't want to be used in your insulting manner for whoever you're saying that about.
[404:17.33]Joey smells just fine, from what I've been told.
[404:20.27]I don't know.
[404:20.79]I have no idea.
[404:21.99]Maybe he doesn't.
[404:22.89]I don't know.
[404:23.47]I have no idea.
[404:24.35]I don't know.
[404:25.39]I'm not there.
[404:26.53]I'm not there, so I can't tell you if he does or he doesn't.
[404:30.43]I don't think.
[404:30.77]He probably doesn't.
[404:33.49]Moving on.
[404:35.98]Oh, you're going to Updog University?
[404:40.48]What's Updog, anyways?
[404:47.10]Just joke.
[404:51.42]No, they'll be doing that.
[404:53.00]I think they came up with that in the fucking Egyptian times.
[405:00.81]Dead Medic, thanks for the 15 bucks, Dead Medic.
[405:03.71]Thank you for playing...
[405:07.23]Thank you for playing this awful game so I never have to.
[405:10.96]I did say that it sucked, didn't I?
[405:13.72]I was like, can I say this?
[405:14.76]Can I say this?
[405:16.18]This game sucks.
[405:21.08]I always hate saying stuff like that.
[405:23.50]Because people like that.
[405:27.07]People like shit.
[405:27.87]And you don't want to just be like, oh, hey, that game sucks.
[405:34.09]It's like, if you'll enjoy it, then I'm glad you do.
[405:37.32]You know, I hate to be that guy.
[405:41.98]When it boils up to your eyeballs and you're just like... What does it got on IGN anyway?
[405:59.10]I hate to be that guy, but it sucks.
[406:03.76]If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't have played it for 12 hours.
[406:06.53]Let's put it that way.
[406:07.45]I got enjoyment out of it, however I did.
[406:11.05]But thank you, Dead Medic.
[406:14.99]We also had...
[406:20.58]The Jack for $2.50.
[406:21.70]Thanks for the Denmark time zone stream.
[406:24.80]Yeah, sure.
[406:25.98]Oh, right, because I went until like 12, 1 o'clock in the morning, I think.
[406:30.40]Well, welcome to Denmark.
[406:32.80]Greetings to Denmark.
[406:35.80]Not yet, but in like a few hours.
[406:40.06]Thank you also to C4G for the $2.50.
[406:42.00]I just logged into WoW and it's free t-shirt day in there, but it ends in like 10 minutes and I can't find the shirts.
[406:48.01]What are you talking about?
[406:51.37]I don't know what that means.
[406:53.65]It was free t-shirt day?
[407:07.64]They don't give t-shirts away in World of Warcraft.
[407:14.81]Oh wait, you don't mean in real life.
[407:16.19]You mean in the game.
[407:17.79]They were giving away taverns.
[407:22.26]I see, alright.
[407:25.40]That's gonna be fun, I'll be playing that.
[407:27.94]Maybe not even on stream, because I don't know if I'll be able to.
[407:31.86]I'm gonna break one of those servers.
[407:35.47]Hey guys, I'm playing on Shadowmoor!
[407:39.93]I'm streaming it!
[407:42.73]What's that behind me?
[407:44.55]What's that?
[407:45.17]Oh, is that a stampede of like 600 fucking people?
[407:51.02]I wanted to do that initially, but they're not going to have enough servers to do that.
[407:58.29]There are actual stream servers, if you still figure... Really?
[408:04.63]Only 600?
[408:05.31]How do they... Alright, let me ask you this.
[408:09.01]I don't know much about Warcraft streamers or Warcraft players or anything.
[408:12.99]I really don't.
[408:14.08]But I know that there are Warcraft streamers that have thousands and thousands of viewers.
[408:19.87]How do they not break the servers?
[408:24.69]Yeah, people that have 2, 3, 4, 5,000 more viewers than I do.
[408:32.36]How do you not flood 1,000, 2,000 people somewhere and just crush it?
[408:40.80]Do you just kind of hide where you play?
[408:42.28]Do you just try to go to a low population server?
[408:56.53]Because they did that thing with, like, instancing servers together, right?
[409:07.08]But I have this weird fear that if I ever wanted to stream that game, if there was only, like, 10 to 20 servers in WoW Classic, and a ton of people were streaming it, and 50, 100,000 people, and even not just people that are playing with, like, the streamers,
[409:24.13]but just people that are trying to load into the game just because they want to play WoW Classic.
[409:29.51]I think they severely underestimate how many people want to play that game.
[409:35.16]More people want to play WoW Classic than want to play real, actual, current WoW.
[409:46.83]How many people are still subbed to WoW?
[409:48.51]What, a couple million?
[409:50.27]One, two, three million?
[409:51.13]Something like that?
[409:52.31]Maybe a little bit more?
[409:54.88]I would assume at least a couple million people are going to want to do that.
[410:01.88]Aren't there like three or four hundred regular servers?
[410:07.24]Two to three million?
[410:07.94]Yeah.
[410:09.44]I need more servers.
[410:18.13]But thank you.
[410:19.79]Thank you MegaBigGargantuan for the $4.
[410:22.51]First try after loadout swap.
[410:24.35]That's true.
[410:25.63]I do remember that specifically.
[410:33.77]Thank you NileOrion for the $6.
[410:35.35]Wait, you need money in the game.
[410:37.89]I'll start with my in-game currency.
[410:43.28]How was my day weekend?
[410:44.38]It was a little stressful, I'm not going to lie, because of the internet.
[410:47.50]I was supposed to stream the last two days in a row.
[410:49.72]But just couldn't because the internet was broken and it seems to be back to normal.
[410:54.34]So I kind of had a stressful weekend.
[410:55.79]I'm not going to lie.
[411:02.71]I've got a stress pimple.
[411:04.07]It happens.
[411:07.93]But almost done with from a few days ago and then we're going to move on to the bits from today.
[411:13.65]Shouldn't take as much longer.
[411:17.26]Back in thanks for the 250 great 11 plus our stream much boomer meltdowns.
[411:21.25]Holy moly.
[411:21.75]I'm tired in a mess Much love to you Jerma and chat.
[411:24.33]Love you all Thanks for sticking around for that the whole thing if you were there for the whole thing.
[411:29.09]That was a long stream Future gave me thanks for the 250 Here's my burger edit.
[411:37.56]This is so gross I'm hungry too.
[411:44.51]You just made me hungry
[411:48.24]Well, I mean, this doesn't make me hungry.
[411:52.44]But you said burger, and now I want one of those.
[411:55.48]It's still early.
[411:56.32]It's only like 8.30.
[411:57.06]This is what happens.
[411:59.20]I lost my train of thought.
[412:00.59]But over the next couple months, I'm going to start pulling streams back permanently to this time that I started today.
[412:10.63]I'm going to start streams at about 1 to 2 p.m.
[412:13.67]Pacific, maybe somewhere around 12 and 2 p.m.
[412:16.61]I'm pulling back to the streams permanently a couple hours.
[412:22.97]Alright, now get this off the screen.
[412:25.62]People are eating spaghetti for god's sake.
[412:29.92]So 2pm Pacific is probably going to be when most of them start.
[412:35.92]And the reason why is I've started to realize something.
[412:40.80]I've been streaming longer than ever before.
[412:44.52]This last year I've been live for at least like five and a half to eight hours, six to seven, six to eight hours almost every single stream.
[412:56.83]And what ends up happening is once you start a stream at three or four o'clock Pacific, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 Pacific, 12 Pacific even we trickle in.
[413:07.69]it that's 3 a.m eastern that's like six five six seven a.m uh Europe so I've been streaming for longer therefore I don't want to keep half the world awake if they want to stick around and watch a stream so pulling the streams back to like 1 2 p.m pacific allows streams to stop before it gets to be more than 11 or 12 o'clock eastern
[413:36.34]I used to do that shit.
[413:39.08]Back in Massachusetts, I would stream till, you know, I'd start at 7 o'clock.
[413:43.85]I used to start at 7 p.m.
[413:45.17]Eastern Time.
[413:46.21]And that was late.
[413:47.41]Thinking about that now, that's a night time.
[413:48.63]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2.
[413:48.83]I don't really want to do that anymore.
[413:58.21]He thinks he's keeping people awake.
[413:59.33]Well, not keeping people awake.
[414:01.57]I've gotten a lot of feedback about how, oh, I really wish I could stick around, but it's 4 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[414:07.73]It's like, oh, yeah, I guess it is.
[414:10.11]I'm like in one of those really early time zones.
[414:14.64]So it'll be something I'll trickle in.
[414:18.00]I mean, this stream started at like 1.30.
[414:21.16]You can expect that same kind of window.
[414:23.38]Like 1 to 2, like 12 to 1, 1 to 2, something like that.
[414:32.21]I like clam chowder.
[414:33.11]Yeah, it's good.
[414:34.32]Take out the clams.
[414:36.22]Add some potatoes and some corn and you got me there.
[414:38.96]I'm not a big fan of clams.
[414:40.50]Fried clams are alright, but clams kind of freak me out.
[414:46.00]I'm more of a fish chowder person.
[414:47.37]I like fish chowder.
[414:48.89]I don't really like clams though.
[414:51.65]But, anyways.
[414:54.85]uh marbosh begali thanks for the 250 it's always fascinating leaving the stream at 1 a.m and finding you still streaming at 9 a.m after waking up hope you enjoyed this weird game good night good night again and that takes us to today so why don't we open that up now earlier today
[415:18.56]I'm going to go back to earlier.
[415:20.72]Here we are.
[415:22.46]We had $3 from Stifunky Chicken today.
[415:27.76]Look up Jerma scares a woman for little children on YouTube.
[415:32.52]What is this?
[415:33.92]Do I really need to look this up?
[415:43.88]Again.
[415:48.24]Jerma scares a room full of children.
[415:59.61]I can't see it.
[416:02.91]Where is it?
[416:04.53]On YouTube?
[416:10.04]Somebody already has it.
[416:10.78]Is that it right there?
[416:20.73]Dermascure is a room full of children.
[416:35.66]Ow, okay.
[416:42.48]My computer's not at my desk, so I had to plug my headphones in.
[416:44.89]Alright, Dermascure is a room full of children.
[417:14.62]What happened?
[417:17.57]Hold on a second.
[417:37.10]Why did you do JoJo poses?
[417:38.84]Because I didn't know what they were.
[417:40.88]I had a list.
[417:45.21]That green screen stream, there were hundreds, hundreds of requests.
[417:52.39]Hundreds of them.
[417:53.05]And I had a list.
[417:54.25]And it was JoJo poses.
[417:55.67]And I didn't know what the fuck they were.
[417:56.97]I just like, okay, I guess I had to get, chat had to help me.
[418:01.91]I had to find like YouTube videos to see what they even were.
[418:09.57]I don't know what a JoJo pose was.
[418:16.03]And I did all of them.
[418:18.74]All of them.
[418:19.42]I think I didn't, I think there was two that I didn't do.
[418:22.58]I'm the JoJo pose green screen guy now.
[418:27.68]I've never, I have not even seen a second of that show.
[418:32.00]I couldn't, if you, okay, if you lined up in the lineup, all the characters from that show, I wouldn't be able to tell you which one of them was JoJo.
[418:40.63]That's how completely ignorant I am to this whole thing.
[418:49.68]I don't know which one of them would be the main... I don't know who it is.
[418:57.72]But anyways, that was... That was Stefunky Chicken.
[419:03.73]I watched it.
[419:04.45]It was a little... It was a little strange.
[419:07.90]Jeff gave five community subs.
[419:09.24]We had five from Jeff earlier at the beginning of the stream.
[419:13.18]I kind of was over there and not paying attention.
[419:15.87]I didn't have like Streamlabs really in my view.
[419:19.77]But thanks to the five community subs.
[419:21.15]Also, there was a lot of money earlier that I just did not see.
[419:26.85]A lot.
[419:28.53]First of all, Fitty gave $64.00.
[419:36.89]They say, don't mind me getting my next bit badge.
[419:40.06]Holy shit, Germany.
[419:42.18]Wait, hold on.
[419:42.82]Wait, wait.
[419:45.08]Holy fucking shit.
[419:46.18]You fucking suck at this, dude.
[419:48.28]Man, you're so bad at this game.
[419:50.39]I didn't even know it was possible.
[419:53.51]Just kidding.
[419:54.05]I love you.
[419:58.85]It was $64 from Fitty.
[420:00.16]That's a shitload of money.
[420:01.20]Thank you.
[420:07.34]And then... That's a lot.
[420:11.32]And then right after that, Ape808 gave 50 bucks.
[420:15.73]Thank you, Ape.
[420:16.77]Money for you.
[420:20.17]That's a shitload of money.
[420:22.03]I didn't even see these.
[420:24.29]Bala Koala gave $50 as well.
[420:26.21]Play the test Jerm of Sun.
[420:28.09]I did.
[420:29.87]I ended up doing it.
[420:30.59]That was $150 in the first 10 minutes of the stream.
[420:34.91]Thank you, the three of you, for your huge amount of money.
[420:37.43]Sorry I missed it.
[420:38.27]I just was kind of back there.
[420:39.91]So I couldn't really see anything.
[420:43.07]You're a big guy.
[420:43.89]Thanks.
[420:44.21]I like when people say that.
[420:48.14]Makes me feel happy.
[420:53.52]So, thank you guys.
[420:56.10]for you for you money for you yeah what's what's the for yeah I know it's for me for you yes yes I know I it's a meme oh okay well thank you uh thank you to the three of you
[421:18.41]We also had three dolls from Tar Alacrin for the three bucks.
[421:21.16]Jerima, for the love of God, please get a haircut.
[421:23.04]My mom walked into my room and I legitimately got embarrassed because of how greasy you look.
[421:26.80]Great stream otherwise, by the way.
[421:28.08]I'm not going to... This is like... This is fine.
[421:35.17]What's wrong?
[421:35.61]You guys act like I fucking just crawled out of a dumpster.
[421:42.35]Just like liquid in my hair.
[421:50.78]Am I going to stream tomorrow?
[421:51.62]Yeah.
[421:53.00]I'm going to try to get a hold of Star and see if he wants to do Terraria tomorrow.
[421:56.92]He was having computer problems, though.
[421:59.63]I'll find that out tomorrow.
[422:00.45]I have to do it later tonight.
[422:07.03]But thank you, Tar Alacrin.
[422:10.21]I look fine.
[422:13.10]Thank you, though.
[422:15.51]We had also I Know Princess of Misery from a few days ago, but also today.
[422:20.96]Thanks for the $5.
[422:24.48]$5.
[422:25.44]This money is for Otto.
[422:26.68]He is a good boy.
[422:28.06]In case my last bit message got lost in the matrix, here's the drawing I wanted you to see.
[422:32.36]I think we got, I think we caught, this is the one, yeah.
[422:34.60]This is the jacked shirtless Jerma.
[422:38.21]It was very, very, very good.
[422:40.41]It's exactly what it looked like.
[422:42.45]And they also say, can you adopt me, by the way?
[422:44.13]I'm 21, but I hope that's not an issue.
[422:45.83]Love you, Dad.
[422:50.66]I don't think that's possible.
[422:52.56]I can't take on any children.
[422:56.30]I have trouble tying my own shoes.
[422:58.34]I don't think I could ever take care of another person.
[423:03.60]21-year-olds could be useful.
[423:07.61]Well, that's like a boomer thing to say.
[423:10.87]I didn't say it.
[423:12.65]Oh, wow, I can't wait until my son gets to be 16 so he can mow the fucking lawn.
[423:21.79]That's a boomer comment there, and you guys call me the boomer.
[423:29.00]Am I going to do a meet and greet one day?
[423:30.30]I do them all the time.
[423:34.68]I don't really... I'm not a meet and greet kind of person, though.
[423:41.42]I don't know, I just never really have been.
[423:45.78]What's in my mouth?
[423:50.56]During packs and places like TwitchCon or any of those convention-type places, I'll usually tweet something.
[423:59.16]Hey, I'm going to be standing here for the next hour.
[424:02.42]If you want to say hello, come say hello.
[424:07.88]I don't think I'm ever going to have one of those scenarios where I'm standing at a booth and there's a line of people to say hello and shake my hand.
[424:15.34]I don't want to do that.
[424:16.62]Not into that.
[424:20.34]Feels weird.
[424:21.12]For me, at least for me, this is a personal thing.
[424:31.29]I have more fun knowing that we're all here together collectively.
[424:38.32]And if I do a meet and greet, everyone's just hanging out, we're sitting around, we're talking about stuff.
[424:44.12]I'm not really into the whole, how are you?
[424:46.32]Good to see you.
[424:47.04]Have a nice day.
[424:47.86]Hey, how are you?
[424:48.56]Good to see you.
[424:49.18]Stay in school.
[424:50.06]Hey, what's up?
[424:51.16]Oh, I like that pin.
[424:52.30]Stay in school.
[424:53.26]Eat your vegetables.
[424:53.98]Goodbye.
[424:54.42]See you later.
[424:54.82]Back to the next person.
[424:56.52]I don't like it.
[424:58.58]And that's not to say there's anything wrong with that.
[425:00.98]It just personally, it just... It just feels weird for me.
[425:05.50]It does.
[425:05.80]There's nothing like that.
[425:08.35]I know, but I'm just saying, I'm a weirdo.
[425:10.37]I'm a weird fucking person.
[425:18.02]I'm a strange person.
[425:19.10]And I think... Lightning bolts just go off in my brain every second.
[425:28.58]That's the awkward talk you have with your uncle.
[425:32.48]Stay in school?
[425:39.93]How is it nothing like that?
[425:40.91]It is like that.
[425:44.09]I guess it depends on who it is, right?
[425:48.93]Ever considered going to a small convention and having a panel where you just fool around for 30 minutes?
[425:55.22]I've thought about it.
[425:57.73]But anytime I go to a convention, I sort of, I turn into a little bit of a recluse.
[426:05.61]I don't really, I just kind of like poke around and look at stuff.
[426:09.83]Oh, okay.
[426:11.17]The new Call of Duty looks alright, I guess.
[426:14.95]What's that over there?
[426:15.75]Oh, alright.
[426:17.28]There's a new Battlefield looking.
[426:19.62]I don't, I don't.
[426:20.44]Hey, look at me.
[426:21.24]It's me, jermaOn A5.
[426:22.62]Welcome to the channel.
[426:23.82]I don't, I just kind of do my own thing.
[426:29.34]Some people really love to go to conventions and turn it on.
[426:35.06]And here we go.
[426:36.22]I'm fucking here and I'm ready.
[426:39.28]I like to dial it down almost to zero when I'm just walking around a convention.
[426:45.80]Go undercover.
[426:47.32]No, but people, I've had people grab me before.
[426:50.66]You know, oh, hey, I think I know who you are.
[426:53.39]And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[426:55.31]And we just kind of hang out and talk for a minute.
[426:57.45]I'm into that.
[427:00.93]But I'm not sure I'd ever want to do, unless it was something that I had complete and total 100% control over.
[427:06.72]I'm not sure I'd want to do a panel where, hey, come and, hey, next, what do you want to ask me?
[427:14.38]It's weirdly enough, you know when Santa, when he's the mall Santa, and people come up and they talk to the mall Santa?
[427:22.14]Like, oh, what do you want for Christmas?
[427:24.46]Well, I want, you know, I just, it freaks me out a little.
[427:29.94]Because I don't think I have very many answers for like a panel.
[427:35.61]He's comparing himself to God.
[427:37.67]No, I'm comparing myself to a mall Santa.
[427:46.27]That is, I think that's a little far off than what you are describing.
[427:55.86]Oh, he's comparing himself to God.
[427:59.02]The guy with the fake beard?
[428:00.40]That's not even the real Santa.
[428:07.01]No, but to put the long story short, I'd rather just have it be an interpersonal thing and not a setup thing that people have to wait in line for or... I mean, it's not.
[428:26.25]I should do a mall Santa stream this year.
[428:31.69]No.
[428:36.34]Just be a mall Santa?
[428:39.06]I don't know.
[428:39.50]I don't know if I'd want to do that.
[428:40.72]I don't like that.
[428:43.28]Mm-mm.
[428:48.68]Clean your webcam.
[428:50.06]Oh, sorry.
[428:50.96]Sorry.
[428:57.81]Better?
[428:59.47]Sorry about that.
[429:04.02]Oh, we're doing bits.
[429:04.80]Right.
[429:05.04]Forgot.
[429:10.30]But that would thank you, Princess of Misery, for the $5.
[429:12.46]Thank you so much.
[429:13.99]Thank you!
[429:15.07]Espada Escalada for the $2.50.
[429:17.23]The Plaid Chad.

[429:26.30]Brush your teeth.
[429:26.82]Your breath smells.
[429:28.26]What's going on with my neck?

[434:04.98]Actually, it was 10,000 of them.
[434:06.54]And that makes $100.
[434:10.08]Thank you, Jacobin, for the test.
[434:14.72]You tested with 100.
[434:17.82]I probably may have tested with a dollar first, but I got it, and that's a fucking huge amount of money.
[434:22.98]Thank you so much.
[434:26.08]That's a lot of money.

[443:37.67]Hey, Jerma, today was a great stream.
[443:38.73]I was just wondering if you could explain how to give bits I'd like to donate.
[443:41.87]Maybe next time try it with 50 cents.
[443:44.25]Alright?
[443:44.83]Next time.
[443:50.46]Thank you for the $50, PhylacteryLitch.

[443:55.88]Thank you.
[443:58.65]You've given a fucking lot.
[444:02.17]I've said it before, I'll say it again.
[444:03.55]Make sure you're taking care of yourself first.
[444:06.35]That's most important.
[444:10.39]50 bits, not $50.
[444:12.37]5,000 bits, actually.
[444:16.50]Thank you, though, for real.

[444:32.75]Hey guys, we need to cancel the carnival stream.

[444:39.08]...the end user license agreements.
[444:41.06]No, guys, what do you mean?
[444:42.68]What's going to happen to the funeral?
[444:44.08]I'm going to use whatever money is in my will and rent out an entire carnival.
[444:48.63]and invite everybody that ever wants to go to the public.
[444:50.93]It's free.
[444:51.61]All the rides are free.
[444:52.59]And then at exactly like 4 p.m.

[444:55.31]Wait, there are rides?
[444:56.81]Oh, yeah, there's rides and shit.
[444:57.87]And at 4 p.m.
[444:58.63]sharp exactly, they're going to put me into a giant fucking slingshot and slingshot my casket into the fucking Atlantic Ocean.
[445:13.60]That's not going to happen on the 21st.
[445:23.16]That's not going to happen.
[445:24.12]I'm going to be just fine.
[445:25.56]There's going to be plenty of safety involved.
[445:33.52]But I appreciate that.
[445:34.74]Don't worry.
[445:35.14]I appreciate the concern, but I'll be just fine.

[458:24.20]So I'm going to be pretty tired, pretty busy.

[458:36.82]I will be there on Friday and Saturday, but probably not... I'm not sure how much I'm going to spend on the convention floor.
[458:44.22]I think I will probably end up maybe a few hours at a time on the convention floor.
[458:50.25]I'll be like, hey, I'm in front of the Smite booth.
[458:54.29]Or whatever.
[458:54.85]Does that game still exist?

[461:21.93]$150.
[461:21.97]$250, not $2.50.
[461:22.67]I'm going to be honest.
[461:23.17]I had to message my bank and say, yes, these transactions were me.
[461:47.22]When your bank is starting to be like, sir, are you sure you want to donate $500 to an online internet clown?
[461:58.51]Yes, I confirm.
[462:02.69]That's $500, and I don't even know what to say.
[462:05.43]That's fucking insane.
[462:08.07]You've got to be shitting me, guys.
[462:09.59]Like, what the fuck is happening right now?
[462:18.46]a phylactery glitch, another $250.
[462:20.31]They figured it out, and I guess they're still going.
[462:30.17]My bank is also upset that I spend so much money on Twitch.
[462:33.13]Fight me.
[462:37.44]Holy shit, guys.
[462:38.90]Do you understand that that's more than $1,000 between these two people?
[462:41.52]Um...
[462:49.54]That's a... Holy shit.
[462:56.44]I'm speechless.
[462:57.26]I don't even know what to say.
[462:58.76]I don't even know what to say about that.
[462:59.96]That's unbelievable.
[463:01.58]That's insane.
[463:04.32]Thank you for the fucking... Just money.
[463:10.38]Just like a shuffleboard that you just went... With hundreds on it.
[463:16.48]I feel like I just, I put down like a hundred bucks on the roulette table and then he was like, oh, you hit it.
[463:22.67]There you go.
[463:26.41]Damn.
[463:27.38]Thank you guys.
[463:27.92]Seriously.
[463:33.60]That means a lot.
[463:34.76]I hope you think it's worth it.
[463:36.19]I hope you can afford that.
[463:39.00]If you please, please only give to this channel.
[463:41.62]Here's like where it is like money to this channel, right?
[463:43.78]Like if you subscribe to the channel, then thank you for subscribing and like $5 a month.
[463:48.78]Thank you.
[463:49.74]But if you're, if you're given tons of money to this channel, we're talking about like, here's like the scale, the here's the tiers of money, right?
[463:59.15]I'm some, I gotta put me somewhere like down here, right?
[464:05.70]Take care of you.
[464:06.66]Make sure that's happening.
[464:07.40]And if it is, then it is.
[464:08.50]And I just want to make it really clear, though.
[464:11.08]So take care of yourself.
[464:12.88]Take care of your friends, your family, your life, your expenses, your entertainment, yourself.
[464:18.82]And then whatever else you have left over, I will take it if you give it to me.
[464:24.74]You know what I mean?
[464:27.29]Because sometimes people come in with a lot of money.
[464:29.15]And it's an incredibly humbling experience to me.
[464:34.21]It's a lot.
[464:38.58]Tremor wants it all.
[464:40.26]Whatever you got after that.
[464:42.40]You know, buy yourself a, buy it up here.
[464:45.69]It's like, buy like a, buy like a Charleston shoe.
[464:50.13]And eat that.
[464:50.61]And then, and then, and then me.
[464:52.05]Of course.
[464:53.77]Says the guy who only reads above it all the bits.
[464:56.07]Yeah, but that's because, I mean, look at how long the end of this stream has been.
[465:01.86]You know, the channel has grown a lot since a year or two ago.
[465:10.49]I was actually thinking about this the other day.
[465:12.02]I guess we can kind of go over this.
[465:15.06]When the channel grows,
[465:20.28]I obviously want to be able to still interact with people.
[465:22.44]And if people are donating at the end of the streams, we'll go over them.
[465:26.31]But there is a very, very real scenario.
[465:30.67]There are real scenarios that have to be, we have to know that they exist.
[465:34.49]If the channel continues to grow, you know, the average viewership has grown by 60 or 50 or 60% in a year.
[465:42.50]What happens if that happens again?
[465:44.34]It might, I don't know.
[465:45.36]I might drop to zero.
[465:46.94]I don't know.
[465:49.57]But I always have to be looking at it.
[465:53.19]Because I don't want to have a scenario where the end of the stream ends up being as long as the entire actual broadcast portion of the stream.
[466:03.98]I don't know.
[466:04.32]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[466:06.20]But we always have to be kind of evaluating how that's doing and how that is.
[466:16.77]But I never want something like this to really disappear.
[466:20.34]But anyways.
[466:23.86]It's the end of the bits voice.
[466:27.42]Back before I even turned it on, I struggled with even turning on subs.
[466:35.30]I didn't want donations.
[466:37.77]I never had PayPal or anything like that, donations.
[466:40.71]I didn't have it.
[466:43.01]I was kind of reluctant to actually have the bits and have the subs.
[466:48.72]But then it's also another scenario of do you want to do Twitch full time?
[466:53.80]Do you want to stream three or four times a week?
[466:57.97]20, 30 hours a week on Twitch?
[467:01.73]Just read during a stream?
[467:02.93]I absolutely refuse.
[467:05.69]The reason why I refuse to do this is because I think it ruins the broadcast.
[467:09.16]I think it takes away from what we're doing here.
[467:14.85]I don't like to read anything during a stream unless, of course, it's something like this huge amount of money that's coming in now.
[467:24.52]I find I have a goal here, right?
[467:28.06]Like today.
[467:29.90]I have a goal that I want to just focus on doing this.
[467:32.56]I want to have fun.
[467:33.62]I want to
[467:35.57]be able to have all of my attention be on the thing that I'm currently streaming.
[467:39.87]And it's not that I don't want to say to those people that sub during the stream or say to people that give a hundred fucking dollars right now, we're stopping because that's a lot of money.
[467:52.78]Whoa, whoa, you just, too many, too many subs just went on.
[467:58.28]Too many.
[467:59.45]That was a lot, that was 69 subs.
[468:04.11]69 almost fucking 70 subs holy shit phylactery that's a lot that's that's too many subs you should have seen this dashboard over here it almost broke holy shit
[468:32.73]and not only that but also vilemi gave a hundred bucks this is just the money stream right now thank you for lemmy hey Jerma speaking of a thousand dollars I'll earn my hundred thousand bit badge with this one I'm sure you know what I want by now love you Jeremy keep doing what you're doing and you'll go far well you want one of these
[469:00.64]and hundreds of dollars and hundreds of dollars in subs.
[469:07.00]He's going to dive in his pile of bits in his vault.
[469:11.26]No, actually, that money is going to go directly to the carnival.
[469:16.32]So, thank you.
[469:27.99]Or a casino.
[469:29.09]I could double it.
[469:30.59]I could double it right now.
[469:33.33]I'll just go to the roulette table, put $1,500 on red.
[469:37.97]I got the shirt on.
[469:44.76]I would not, I would never do that.
[469:47.16]Ever.
[469:50.22]Never.
[469:53.27]My good luck charm.
[469:54.31]But thank you, Phylactery.
[469:55.65]Thank you, Vilemi.
[469:58.15]You guys are just absolutely just spoiling me.
[470:02.03]Just rotten.
[470:03.89]Thank you.
[470:11.15]I hope I can use the money that you're giving me for things that can come back into the channel that maybe you think are fun.
[470:19.20]Thank you.
[470:21.34]Treat yourself to a McChicken later on.
[470:27.20]But Cosmic Moses, thanks for the $5.
[470:29.38]Jeremy, I missed the last few streams because I've been in the hospital with necrotizing fasciitis or fasciitis.
[470:37.31]I'm not sure what that is, but hopefully you're alright.
[470:39.75]I'm back home, but that aging video with the up music made me sad, like actually sad.
[470:47.27]Hopefully you're good.
[470:51.74]I'm not sure what that exact illness is.
[471:00.03]But no, don't worry about me.
[471:03.53]That aging video, it was just a little joke.
[471:07.78]You know?
[471:13.84]But for you, hopefully you can get that squared away.
[471:19.58]I'm not sure what that entails, but much love to you.
[471:24.12]Hopefully you got the right doctors on the case there.
[471:31.57]Keep your head up.
[471:32.59]That's right.
[471:38.15]Hey, I gave 10 bits and my badge didn't update.
[471:40.10]I feel robbed.
[471:42.78]Is there a badge for 10?
[471:47.36]My mouth is covered?
[471:49.02]Oh.
[471:49.12]It's because I keep dropping this thing into the ground.
[471:54.68]By the way, this really does look like you're looking through to my stream through a dirty bathroom mirror.
[472:09.48]But thank you, Cosmic Moses.
[472:11.73]Get well soon.
[472:14.05]Thank you so much for the $5.
[472:14.69]Fus Roboto, thanks for the $10.
[472:19.29]Hey, there was a glitch in the bit system, so don't believe the amount that it says.
[472:23.04]This is 100 million bits.
[472:28.16]That would be a lot.
[472:28.92]That would be at least $200.
[472:30.12]I can't do the math in my head quickly.
[472:37.47]That's like $50, $100 or something.
[472:40.89]It's a lot.
[472:43.22]Thanks for the $10, though.
[472:44.14]Fuss Roboto.
[472:45.84]Peanut Gangster, thanks for $2.50.
[472:47.02]You think at this point your viewers have covered the cost of the next Jerma Rumble live action?
[472:51.78]Um... One at a time.
[472:56.36]You know, one by one.
[472:59.86]One thing that I do have to be careful of is because I am financing all these things by myself, I'm not getting any money from any other entity, right?
[473:10.52]It's just like the money that I get from Twitch is this money that I'm using, right?
[473:15.87]But I do have to be careful.
[473:17.13]And I don't really ever want any outside sponsorships.
[473:22.69]I've talked about it before with people at Twitch and people that are involved in this particular project.
[473:29.80]It's, it kind of, it muddies it a little.
[473:34.51]What about fruit?
[473:35.97]Nah, I lost that sponsorship.
[473:39.71]I ate a bag of combos on camera and they ditched me.
[473:44.49]It's like what, you ate a bag of combos?
[473:45.97]Yeah, they're 645 calories a bag and they made it of processed fake cheese.
[473:51.64]What's the problem?
[473:56.58]Whatever.
[474:01.97]Get a Baskin Robbins sponsorship?
[474:04.00]No.
[474:06.66]How much money did I get from the Door Cube?
[474:09.08]I had an affiliate code with Door Cube and it was used three times.
[474:13.67]So I made 14 cents.
[474:22.56]Nine cents after taxes.
[474:28.87]hey pigeon thanks for the 250 because I had to donate for you to answer it oh I see I see I see that's what they're not like this was for okay I'll be a Twitch condo you'll see me you will see me at twitchcon gonder lane thanks for the 250 will you ever come back to the east coast we miss you cox is no good so come back to your comfy Boston basement where you grew famous
[474:56.91]Well, fiber is being laid all over Vegas right now.
[475:01.52]So I will have fiber over the next... I will be on a fiber optic network in three, four months, maybe.
[475:12.99]It depends.
[475:13.59]Either late 2019 or early 2020.
[475:14.29]I will have a 1,000, 1,000 symmetrical fiber line.
[475:23.24]before my 35th birthday.
[475:26.63]Way before that.
[475:27.95]Like six months tops.
[475:32.87]And the thing with fiber is it's not coax.
[475:35.17]So all this bullshit, all these problems, all these awful internet issues do not exist on fiber.
[475:42.20]There is no, oh, somebody turned on their microwave and kicked everybody off the network.
[475:48.14]Somebody had an unscrewed cable coax.
[475:50.85]There's no noise ingress like that with fiber.
[475:55.15]So, and I say that now, but it's going to be a thousand upload.
[475:58.80]I have 30 up right now.
[476:00.26]It's going to be 1,000 through a fiber optic line.
[476:05.66]It would be, I would just be cursed.
[476:08.22]It would be me.
[476:08.94]The problem would be me at that point.
[476:10.74]If I cannot have a stable connection with fiber, a thousand fucking upload, then it's me.
[476:18.57]It has to be.
[476:20.63]When's the carnival stream?
[476:21.57]September 21st.
[476:24.32]Somewhere in the early afternoon Eastern time.
[476:31.45]But no, I have no plans on moving back to the East Coast.
[476:34.23]I will be on the West Coast for at least... Whether it's somewhere in Vegas over the years or... I don't know.
[476:43.52]I want to be on the West Coast.
[476:45.94]I'll be in Vegas for a while, though.
[476:47.40]That's for certain.
[476:53.48]random guy cursed me yeah I didn't buy the I gotta buy that fiber curse removal you're right fiverr we also had that all that money came in the 69 subs from phylactery
[477:16.89]three dollars from cyan TF2 holy this man gave 500 bits that's insane if you decide to give me a cent then it's as appreciated as anything else if you decide to give this channel any money it's not just a thousand dollars of somebody donating
[477:37.75]Or supporting subs, too.
[477:39.71]There's a lot of consistent subs on this channel, more than I ever could have possibly imagined.
[477:44.49]So it's not just the people dropping the 500 bucks.
[477:48.55]As much as that's amazing and insane for me, it's not just that.
[477:54.15]So don't feel like, oh, shit, I only gave $3 today.
[477:57.25]Fuck.
[477:57.47]No, I do not feel that.
[477:59.47]I do not feel that way.
[478:04.45]There's no cent equivalent of a bit.
[478:05.79]I think it's 25 cents minimum, right?
[478:08.47]That's to prevent people from just doing one cent spam with the thing.
[478:12.31]Right?
[478:12.85]So you can just have the chat be filled with the symbol.
[478:17.93]And speaking of subs, there's another five from Kazzy.
[478:22.46]Kazzy 101, five community subs.
[478:24.22]Thank you, Kazzy.
[478:27.00]Five more subs from The Subway.
[478:29.78]No, for real.
[478:31.74]You guys are too good.
[478:33.30]You guys are too good to me.
[478:35.56]Just glad you still think that it's fun to be in the channel.
[478:37.78]And I'm glad you still, this many years later, I've been doing this for a long time.
[478:44.31]A lot of times when people do this kind of shit for a long fucking time, you know, wow, it's... Hey, here we go.
[478:52.13]Whoa, I started YouTube eight plus years ago.
[478:56.22]Whoa, this is a roller coaster.
[478:58.76]This is so cool.
[479:00.66]Five years, six years.
[479:02.02]Okay, seven years.
[479:03.48]Alright.
[479:04.88]This is, you guys are still fucking doing this.
[479:08.34]You guys are still going.
[479:10.58]And I don't know, I'm shocked that I've still been able to do this.
[479:23.08]It's been a long fucking time.
[479:26.04]So take things like the carnival stream as my way of saying thank you and hopefully we can have a fun time.
[479:34.60]It doesn't matter if that stream is, oh, was that stream expensive?
[479:39.59]Who gives a shit?
[479:41.41]Who gives a shit?
[479:44.59]You know what I mean?
[479:47.43]It's worth doing.
[479:52.95]I mean that.
[479:56.79]He's getting better with age.
[479:58.69]We'll see.
[480:02.45]But we're reaching the end here.
[480:05.07]We had Phylactery Lich gave $5.
[480:09.08]And they say, seriously, I give all these bits and subs because you're my primary entertainment.
[480:14.96]And I never want to stop watching your funny ass streams involved.
[480:17.84]69 subs was for the meme.
[480:19.68]But next time I'll do 420.
[480:21.53]Not tonight, though, because we're about to leave.
[480:27.17]420 subs.
[480:27.65]We're not doing that tonight, though.
[480:34.85]Hold on to that one.
[480:36.57]Because that's fucking, like, thousands of dollars.
[480:41.54]Thank you, though.
[480:42.12]I really appreciate that.
[480:43.18]I'm humbled to be your primary entertainment.
[480:47.80]That would, like, kill the chat.
[480:49.76]It would be, like, it would just be flying by.
[480:56.26]But thank you.
[480:57.60]I really appreciate it.
[480:59.74]Pigeon, thank you for the $250 and the $250 right on top of it.
[481:02.84]How the hell do you do your budget?
[481:05.82]Thankfully, there's other people involved that can help with that.
[481:10.50]If you talk about the carnival thing.
[481:12.50]I have things that I specifically want that there are two companies involved.
[481:17.28]So I have told that we're on paper.
[481:20.49]I spent a long time on this.
[481:23.07]Remember I told you I've been dialing streams back.
[481:26.68]My streams have been, instead of three or four times a week, it's like two or three times a week now.
[481:33.87]And I obviously want to stay by the book.
[481:36.25]Twitch actually keeps a really good track of what's coming out and coming in.
[481:40.31]So it's not just, oh, I have to go through this and see.
[481:43.87]They keep a pretty good track of it.
[481:52.00]That voice thing?
[481:52.58]Yeah.
[481:54.94]That's old news.
[481:57.27]And it fucking still sounds good.
[482:02.98]It still sounds fucking just as good as it did when I made it fucking 12, 15 years ago.
[482:12.22]Yeah.
[482:14.54]That's like more than 10, 15 years old.
[482:17.84]And I still got it.
[482:22.66]Was that before I played TF2?
[482:23.76]That was like before I went to college.
[482:28.05]that was a long time ago why does the profile say that you're a teenager adult male senior male and old male no that's like what I'm capable of that's what I'm capable of that's what I'm capable of that's what I'm capable of that is what I'm capable of and if you don't think that that was every entire spectrum of age
[483:01.11]It was.
[483:02.47]Anyways, guys.
[483:06.25]That's all the voices he has.
[483:08.38]That's not true.
[483:09.80]I have at least five or six others.
[483:14.76]I got at least ten voices.
[483:16.12]Twelve.
[483:19.90]That's going to be the time here.
[483:21.90]I did not expect this to be an eight-hour stream, but it is.
[483:24.92]We've done some long ones recently.
[483:26.10]This is another long one.
[483:28.54]I'm going to see what Star's up to tomorrow.
[483:31.32]And maybe there'll be Terraria tomorrow if his computer is working.
[483:34.42]That was a problem before.
[483:36.68]I'm going to go take a shower.
[483:37.44]I'm going to get some food.
[483:38.72]And I'm going to get some rest.
[483:40.13]Thank you, everybody.
[483:41.15]Thank you for fucking joining me.
[483:42.45]I hope you enjoyed this stream.
[483:43.51]I had a blast playing.
[483:45.39]It was definitely worth playing.
[483:46.89]For sure.
[483:48.67]Right at the very end.
[483:49.53]Oh, I can do the outro screen.
[483:53.45]Diabeats, thanks for the $3.
[483:55.69]Jerma, thanks for all the content you've provided over the years.
[483:57.35]I feel like I can speak for the whole chat here when I say you've done wonders through this site.
[484:01.83]Sorry for all the internet problems.
[484:02.91]That really sucks.
[484:03.85]Nonetheless, we'll be here through it all.
[484:08.62]Thank you.
[484:13.72]The internet is just... In the United States, unfortunately, you kind of just have to throw dice in the air if you're going to have a good stable upload connection.
[484:20.91]That's just the way it works.
[484:22.05]It's like that everywhere.
[484:24.09]Some people don't have a problem at all.
[484:25.71]Some people have more problems than they can deal with.
[484:28.79]And it sucks.
[484:31.45]Because having unstable internet, it's one thing.
[484:33.62]Dropping like 1,000, 2,000 frames a stream is pretty normal.
[484:40.20]But thank you.
[484:41.83]And finally, Garfy the Monday Killer, Jerm the worm, you didn't click on Garf's links.
[484:45.71]Oh shit, yeah, you already didn't.
[484:47.93]Garf doesn't come around out of retirement very often.
[484:51.25]Garf made a more palatable trailer exclusive to you.
[484:53.95]Alright.
[484:58.55]The film allows live action bits and we'd love to have you on board the crew since we're recruiting YouTubers.
[485:05.19]Consider this a pitch to you and a trailer for the audience.
[485:09.20]Here we go!
[485:10.70]It's a trailer!
[485:28.32]Are you in like a clown costume?
[485:44.18]Don't worry about it.
[485:50.92]He was here last night.
[485:52.58]He forced me to put on these clothes and then flew away without saying anything.
[485:56.56]I'm fine.
[485:57.54]It's fine.
[486:00.26]I'm fine, but I'm worried about the tornado, though.
[486:06.34]Ah, but first you must fight him.
[486:09.65]Go get him.
[486:20.42]It's over.
[486:27.58]That was pretty great, actually.
[486:35.34]Thank you, Garfield.
[486:37.58]Good luck to you.
[486:39.63]If I have time, maybe I would throw in a few lines or something.
[486:43.50]The only problem is I'm not going to have very much time until after September.
[486:49.06]Because of these, a couple of streams, especially the carnival.
[486:53.92]Looked really interesting, though.
[486:59.95]Pigeon, thanks for the $2.50.
[487:03.19]Jerma, I keep fucking up my bits.
[487:08.97]I keep fucking up my bits.
[487:12.99]Hallulu drew this.
[487:17.03]Another fucking awesome piece of artwork.
[487:21.27]This is awesome.
[487:25.56]Oh no, he said the F word.
[487:26.76]Oh no, he said the F word.
[487:36.90]Look at those eyes.
[487:40.09]I feel like I could swim in those eyes.
[487:41.45]They're like pools.
[487:46.36]Shiny, glistening eyes.
[487:51.70]Thank you, Halulu.
[487:53.78]And thank you, pigeon, for bringing it to my attention.
[487:58.10]This is great.
[488:00.88]Complimenting yourself.
[488:03.26]No, I'm complimenting a picture that was drawn of myself.
[488:08.59]It's not me.
[488:09.30]That's a picture that was drawn of me.
[488:16.44]Nice work.
[488:17.22]For real.
[488:21.50]That's my time.
[488:23.82]I will see you guys all tomorrow.
[488:26.87]Whatever it is we do, we do.
[488:28.51]I have not decided yet.
[488:30.83]There are plenty of options.
[488:33.15]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[488:35.73]It's still fairly early for some of us.
[488:39.27]Take care.
[488:39.63]See you tomorrow.
[488:41.37]And I forgot the fucking credits.
[488:43.87]No, I didn't.
[488:44.95]Here we go.
[488:54.11]Here they come.
[488:55.99]It's going to be a lot considering the hundred plus community subs that came through here.
[489:04.68]Oh, man.
[489:09.30]Where do you recommend games?
[489:10.32]Go to the Discord.
[489:12.30]There's a channel in the Discord that is for recommendations specifically.
[489:17.16]I check it probably once a week.
[489:23.74]This is potentially hundreds of subs here.
[489:30.89]Read them out loud?
[489:31.81]I can't.
[489:32.55]There's too many.
[489:35.49]But where do we demand games?
[489:38.65]To my face and then I'll tell you I don't get demanded.
[489:42.25]I get recommendated.
[489:52.60]Play Battle for Bikini Bottom when it gets a remaster.
[489:54.80]They're remastering that game?
[490:01.58]Avery dropped dead thanks to the $5.
[490:05.39]Hey, I also fucked up my bits.
[490:07.01]Please say hi to me and look at my cute dog.
[490:10.95]Dog's name is Wheezy.
[490:14.05]Beagle?
[490:16.95]Let's take a look at this cute dog on stream.
[490:18.71]Thank you for the $5, though, Avery.
[490:26.50]Is it a beagle?
[490:27.42]Yeah.
[490:31.84]Look at this dog.
[490:36.94]Hold on, I want to put it behind the credits.
[490:41.34]Look at this dog.
[490:45.53]Sleepy dog.
[490:48.73]I have to do that voice whenever I see a dog.
[490:50.63]It's important.
[490:56.20]He's got a special planky.
[491:04.84]No, thank you.
[491:06.87]Dog looks comfy.
[491:15.26]I do cutesy.
[491:15.90]I think you have to do a cutesy voice at an animal.
[491:19.08]It could be a dog.
[491:19.96]It could be a squirrel.
[491:20.78]I do that shit to lizards.
[491:28.73]Thank you, The Sandwich, for one, for $2.50.
[491:32.94]Hey, Germanium, here's some bits just to fill the air while the credits roll.
[491:39.24]Hey, thanks.
[491:43.48]Thank you, The Sandwich, for one.
[491:47.30]For you, $2.50.
[491:51.29]Hey, thanks.
[491:52.43]Hey, thanks.
[491:54.45]I want a bird.
[491:56.71]I want one of those big ass birds.
[491:59.60]But they're really loud, aren't they?
[492:01.06]I wouldn't be able to stream.
[492:06.68]If I had a huge bird back here, wouldn't it just be like all day?
[492:20.15]That's a vulture.
[492:21.17]Well, you know what I mean.
[492:29.31]Alright, guys.
[492:31.59]Take care.
[492:31.97]See you tomorrow.
[492:34.97]Probably going to be starting at the normal time tomorrow.
[492:37.54]Somewhere around 3 and 4 p.m.
[492:39.42]Pacific.
[492:41.54]Take care.
[492:42.57]See you soon.
[493:16.23]Thank you.
