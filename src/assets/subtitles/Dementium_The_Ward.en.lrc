[00:32.77]What's happening?
[00:35.83]How are you?
[00:37.14]Hi.
[00:46.64]This dream's gonna be fucking demented.
[00:55.23]Good afternoon.
[01:02.65]You can play the Night Rain DLC.
[01:04.80]Uh, no.
[01:07.24]Not here.
[01:07.92]I might try it on...
[01:12.75]Maybe off stream, I don't know.
[01:20.74]What's your Spotify rap to look like?
[01:23.14]Um...
[01:29.13]Zero songs played?
[01:36.73]I don't, I have never used Spotify in my life.
[01:50.60]I don't think I listen to enough music regularly to have Spotify.
[02:05.56]Now my new routine is to turn on the talk radio, just disagree with everything everybody says.
[02:09.82]Like in the morning drive to the grocery store.
[02:15.71]That's my new Spotify.
[02:28.36]That's Boomer?
[02:31.35]I mean, it's like...
[02:31.85]I listen to the radio in the car.
[02:35.67]Maybe...
[02:37.68]Like, for probably 10 to 20 minutes.
[02:42.46]Once every week or two.
[02:45.44]Sometimes you just turn it on.
[02:46.41]You're just like, what is going on on the fucking AM frequency right now?
[03:00.64]You know something I've noticed about radio is, and I don't know if you guys will relate to this because I don't know how many people actually even listen to the radio anymore.
[03:08.66]I don't really either, so I'm not saying, oh, you know, you kids don't listen to the radio, and neither do I.
[03:14.80]But something that will happen is I will...
[03:18.31]turn on the radio and they'll be going into a break it's like and we'll be right back
[03:25.81]and then they're just like in a break.
[03:29.14]I feel like that happens every single time.
[03:31.83]I'd say like 70% of the time I turn the radio on.
[03:40.54]I seem to catch the radio one minute before they go into a break or in the middle of a commercial break every time.
[03:49.77]I'm not sure I've ever gotten to hear a full period where they, where back from break and then go to a break.
[03:57.73]It's always just when they start to do a break.
[04:02.54]I don't think I've ever heard the radio for real.
[04:06.48]Now you know what it feels like to join your stream.
[04:10.69]Well, I think that's any stream on Twitch that has the ad enabled.
[04:14.98]We can't turn it off.
[04:23.28]Yeah, but the difference is three and a half minutes later, I don't go to an ad break.
[04:29.85]Let's bring on our first guest and talk for three minutes and then go to a six minute ad break.
[04:35.29]That don't happen here.
[04:47.09]Who are you?
[04:47.96]Who are you?
[04:48.40]Who are you?
[04:51.47]You just got owned?
[04:55.22]No, I didn't.
[04:58.09]I actually did not get owned.
[05:00.32]I put up a defense, gave a very good rebuttal, and then that person ran.
[05:04.42]That person ran.
[05:05.63]Go to the chat logs.
[05:06.39]They're not even here.
[05:08.25]That person ran, dude.
[05:09.54]They're not even here anymore.
[05:12.43]They got rebuttaled so bad, they just...
[05:14.12]I have to leave the stream.
[05:16.53]Maybe if I leave the stream, people will know I said that.
[05:19.53]Yeah, got you.
[05:29.95]Have you seen Zootopia 2?
[05:31.58]No.
[05:36.89]Is it out?
[05:41.16]You're angry today?
[05:42.08]I'm not angry.
[05:51.17]Why are you so combative?
[05:52.10]Why are you combative, asking a combative question like that?
[05:59.60]Alright, uh, no, I haven't seen Zootopia 2.
[06:01.81]I haven't seen Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[06:04.93]I haven't seen, um...
[06:09.81]Hotel Transylvania 2.
[06:12.22]I haven't seen...
[06:12.97]Inside Out 2.
[06:16.24]I haven't seen...
[06:16.96]I haven't seen them.
[06:17.57]I'm sorry guys.
[06:26.87]Today, we're going to be playing some games, hanging out.
[06:29.77]It's going to be probably a little chill time.
[06:32.58]I'm going to have a go at it.
[06:38.25]I've been wanting to play this one for a while.
[06:39.95]Probably just gonna play for like an hour or two.
[06:42.20]I don't necessarily want to play this for six hours.
[06:46.92]This game's called Dementium the Ward.
[06:51.06]It's been in the list for a while.
[06:52.64]If you don't know what this game is, it is a DS game that got a PC port.
[06:59.27]I don't know very much about it.
[07:00.38]I just know that little backstory.
[07:01.93]It's kind of a weird, it was like a horror game on the DS, which believe it or not, they existed.
[07:11.07]but is it a 3DS port or is it a regular DS port?
[07:15.72]Something like that.
[07:19.12]Is it true that you spent $80 on Family Guy, the quest for stuff?
[07:22.19]Yes.
[07:22.98]I've been very upfront and transparent about that.
[07:30.29]Yes, that's going to be the question that's asked to me.
[07:32.24]I've made this joke already, but during the political debate where I run for senator, the moderator is going to bring that up.
[07:41.04]And I'm going to be as clear as I am to you right now.
[07:44.94]Yeah, well, that's taken a little bit out of context, but yes, I did spend $75 in Family Guy the Quest for Stuff.
[07:51.11]It was to make, it was a good time waster at the time.
[07:55.53]It was a good thing that I played at the time.
[07:57.21]You know, let's compare it.
[07:58.66]People spend thousands on that game.
[08:00.46]Some people spent $10,000 on that game.
[08:04.04]Probably.
[08:05.21]I spent only 1% of that.
[08:07.79]And I promise to not use your tax dollars for Family Guy quest for stuff.
[08:14.42]And there's a huge scandal that comes out that I used a shitload of like taxpayer funded money.
[08:20.38]Wasn't it $200 at the start and you kept lowering it?
[08:23.90]Have I lowered it from $75?
[08:26.37]No.
[08:27.59]I have been consistently saying it was $75 since like 2019, okay?
[08:34.40]My story's been straight the whole time.
[08:42.94]You said 50 once.
[08:45.35]No, I did... whatever.
[08:48.67]You guys ready for this demented game?
[08:53.42]Hope you have it.
[08:53.96]And we're going to play The Room.
[08:55.12]Not The Room.
[08:57.09]That's a movie.
[08:58.49]We're going to play Withering Rooms, not The Room.
[09:03.19]Probably after like an hour or two of this.
[09:09.95]That's also a game.
[09:11.72]Well, that's Silent Hill 4, right?
[09:14.53]Alright, let's move over here.
[09:17.76]I have no idea what to expect.
[09:18.93]I just knew that I wanted to play it.
[09:21.16]So let's try it out.
[09:24.16]Can you hear it?
[09:25.07]Yes, you can.
[09:26.49]Alright, new game.
[09:29.26]So this is going to be the DS cursor, I imagine, right?
[09:33.34]I think.
[09:36.70]Unnormal, hard, or demented.
[09:43.72]I don't even want to know what the demented category is, but you probably die in one hit.
[09:52.34]I don't think I want to play the one where you die in one hit.
[09:57.97]I mean, it is a DS game.
[09:59.13]What would Demented be for a DS game?
[10:02.87]I'm doing normal, I don't care.
[10:07.68]The admittance.
[10:09.30]Oh my god!
[10:15.16]She's just a scary girl.
[10:22.69]Okay.
[10:31.02]Alright, I'm walking.
[10:31.98]I got 100%.
[10:32.51]Do I have an inventory?
[10:40.17]Toilet.
[10:42.34]This game is pretty dark.
[10:45.49]And I mean that like physically dark.
[10:47.91]Wait.
[10:49.08]Notepad.
[10:49.70]An old notepad with most of its pages torn out.
[10:52.51]Why did you do it is written on the front page.
[10:54.63]There's also a small key.
[10:57.08]Okay, take the key.
[10:57.90]This is fucking demented.
[11:07.84]Everybody has to evacuate the building?
[11:20.94]Okay, chain and padlock.
[11:25.78]Locked.
[11:32.40]is a newspaper the headline reads, Man Brutally Murders Wife.
[11:38.76]That's it?
[11:42.15]Is there any more context to that?
[11:43.49]That's just it?
[11:44.24]That's the whole article?
[11:52.19]There's something in here.
[12:01.05]What does it say?
[12:04.08]Oh!
[12:04.52]It reads 081399.
[12:05.37]It looks like it was written in blood.
[12:07.82]Alright, let's get a screenshot on that.
[12:11.65]081399.
[12:12.96]Let's get a mental screenshot please.
[12:21.97]Every single door is locked.
[12:23.39]Every door is locked.
[12:28.44]I can't change the FOV either.
[12:30.41]Imagine this on a fucking DS screen, alright?
[12:33.50]They had to blow it up a little.
[12:39.68]What the fuck?
[12:47.81]I thought my audio cut out.
[12:49.64]Alright, that was scary.
[12:52.02]That was actually kind of crazy.
[12:58.68]I'm not going that way.
[12:59.58]Oh, there we go.
[13:02.07]Flashlight.
[13:02.83]Very helpful to be able to see where I'm going.
[13:05.92]Finally.
[13:09.76]Staff only.
[13:12.36]Enter the secret code.
[13:13.67]Oh, I know what it is.
[13:15.54]Oh, what was it?
[13:17.95]What was the mental screenshot that we all took?
[13:20.02]081399.
[13:29.26]I know this sound effect.
[13:33.45]This is the running around in Goldeneye 007 music.
[13:36.80]And I said music, but you know what I mean.
[13:39.73]How do I use that?
[13:44.05]Oh, fuck.
[13:47.63]This gun cage is locked.
[13:49.19]One of those shotguns would be handy.
[13:51.10]Oh, nice.
[13:51.60]Alright.
[13:52.42]How do I turn off that?
[13:54.47]How do I turn the alarm off?
[14:03.38]I think it's sort of...
[14:13.77]Was there a monster?
[14:20.45]There.
[14:21.23]I just knocked his head off!
[14:22.74]Alright, that was way easier than I thought it was gonna be.
[14:28.89]I don't need health.
[14:29.52]I guess I can't hold it.
[14:36.40]Is there battery on the flashlight?
[14:39.11]Hmm.
[14:40.75]Well, that looks dangerous.
[14:44.13]I'm going this way.
[14:48.80]Oh shit.
[14:51.50]Okay.
[14:53.39]Does it have to go forward?
[14:54.71]It's just a bathroom, right?
[14:56.32]Okay.
[15:03.77]Anybody in here?
[15:07.94]No.
[15:16.61]This is huge.
[15:17.77]Why is it so high?
[15:22.01]And why does it look like most of the piss was pissed into the top of the urinal?
[15:27.29]People are peeing up into the top.
[15:33.22]There's not a whole lot of stainage down there.
[15:34.70]There's a little bit.
[15:35.71]It's coming from the top here.
[15:36.67]This is where the stain begins.
[15:42.25]Murderer.
[15:47.77]I'll give this person credit to get it to fill in the whole thing on what I imagine is a first try.
[15:54.76]Because when it steams up, you only got one go at that.
[15:57.03]You can't, I mean, you'd have to take a shower to recreate, you'd have to wipe it all away and then take another shower.
[16:02.78]So to actually get that kind of placement right from the get-go is kind of impressive.
[16:11.32]Bye.
[16:20.81]I knew there was going to be somebody in the bathroom.
[16:25.81]There's a lot of health.
[16:26.96]Okay.
[16:28.51]There's...
[16:30.26]Maybe I should have played on demented because there's like 25 health containers.
[16:37.03]Is there nothing else in here?
[16:43.91]No.
[16:47.00]How would this have played on the DS?
[16:52.43]Am I missing something or is that just the scary bathroom with health in it?
[16:59.69]half the difficulty was probably playing on the DS.
[17:02.29]That's actually true, you're right.
[17:14.72]There's health everywhere.
[17:24.56]Dude, there's a million HP and they blink it.
[17:37.00]I'm fine, don't worry.
[17:41.31]I'll take one of the 50 health containers.
[17:49.64]Look, I'm making fun of that now, but I'm going to wish I had those probably in 10 minutes.
[18:08.52]Alright, let's go.
[18:12.68]How come you're not showing the other screen?
[18:16.17]That's true.
[18:16.85]What would be on the other screen?
[18:20.82]Fucking demented.
[18:29.58]I actually like this game.
[18:30.52]This game's fun.
[18:32.25]I imagine this on a DS.
[18:34.32]It would be pretty cool, actually.
[18:36.62]Um, hello?
[18:48.06]Locked.
[18:49.80]Alright, well, what is it?
[18:51.63]Save.
[18:56.33]Alright, let's go.
[19:02.79]What the fuck?
[19:03.69]Bugs!
[19:05.78]Can they even hurt you?
[19:06.54]Alright, they can hurt you.
[19:11.37]Should I hit them?
[19:22.65]Yeah, die!
[19:34.30]Those things did more damage than the zombies did.
[19:44.05]Roof access?
[19:44.99]Do I want to do that?
[19:47.00]Get out of here.
[19:48.51]I think they're afraid of light.
[19:50.68]Yep.
[19:52.77]Yep.
[20:01.57]Okay.
[20:03.11]Yep.
[20:14.20]to the roof.
[20:21.85]We're already at chapter two?
[20:23.66]How many chapters in this game are there?
[20:32.02]Okay!
[20:39.39]There's six or seven chapters, okay.
[20:45.49]Get out of here Another one
[21:01.89]Oh my god, why are there so many of them?
[21:06.92]Do I keep spawning them?
[21:18.08]Why are they all wearing jeans?
[21:19.69]Uh oh.
[21:25.82]This is look at this trail.
[21:28.74]Would it start?
[21:37.80]Hmm.
[21:38.68]It's going this way.
[21:47.00]Okay, dude, all of a sudden, there's not gonna be 500 health containers?
[22:05.77]They put all the health in the game in the first four rooms.
[22:20.31]Okay.
[22:21.70]Should I have gone the other way?
[22:22.48]Do I even have- I guess I- Ooh, there's a tab!
[22:28.21]Z, items.
[22:32.17]Yep.
[22:34.51]Okay, here's all the...
[22:35.13]Display high-res.
[22:36.76]Retro CRT.
[22:38.55]What should I do?
[22:41.03]Retro CRT or retro or high-res CRT?
[22:48.28]Retro CRT.
[22:51.07]Heartbeat.
[22:52.66]Normal.
[22:53.83]Quiet.
[22:55.22]I hate that.
[22:56.27]Turn it off.
[23:00.24]Maybe put it on low.
[23:03.11]Filter.
[23:04.27]Yes.
[23:05.16]No.
[23:05.58]Yes.
[23:06.08]No.
[23:07.18]What does filter mean?
[23:15.76]Yeah, the DS had a famous CRT display.
[23:20.21]I'm gonna get killed by the fucking bugs.
[23:21.62]Hold on.
[23:31.71]I'm already at chapter three.
[23:33.21]I'm halfway through.
[23:33.73]The game's almost over.
[23:44.21]Oh shit.
[23:47.61]Creepy... music.
[23:52.96]Psychomotor agitation.
[23:56.99]Susanna Scott, treatment hydrotherapy.
[24:02.46]Okay, fuck you.
[24:03.54]This game, that's a... We're halfway through the game and they... Whatever.
[24:07.90]I didn't...
[24:13.39]We're at Chapter 3, you know it was gonna happen once.
[24:21.66]I knew this was like a scary game, but wait.
[24:24.11]Are these bullets?
[24:26.38]Alright, give me a gun.
[24:27.41]Can I please have a gun?
[24:41.54]Now that's what I call fucking demented.
[24:59.81]You look at this little kid shit in here.
[25:03.49]It's fucked up.
[25:07.63]There's a kid crying.
[25:27.20]Oh, nice.
[25:28.09]Save point.
[25:34.01]No weapons or anything?
[25:34.67]Am I just missing a ton of stuff?
[25:50.76]Another chat member bites the dust.
[25:52.76]What did they do?
[25:59.64]Get out of here
[26:09.98]Good.
[26:17.96]Good.
[26:22.42]There are 16 chapters, by the way, that Chatter was making one of those jokes.
[26:26.78]Oh, okay.
[26:34.42]Guess I could go this way.
[26:35.32]There's a lot of places you can go on this map.
[26:52.98]This game's charming, I like it.
[27:06.83]Hey.
[27:09.89]Slug person?
[27:11.62]Slug person right here.
[27:12.82]Watch this.
[27:18.27]Oh no.
[27:19.87]It's just a guy with jeans on.
[27:32.13]I'm gonna follow the blood, alright?
[27:35.40]Alright, that's locked.
[27:42.57]Where am I on the map?
[27:50.99]There's a lot of places I could go.
[27:52.94]So is the red like a hotspot or something?
[27:54.76]What does the red mean?
[27:56.89]That means like, hey, this is a hotspot of activity or something.
[28:06.16]It means unlocked doors.
[28:12.94]Locked door.
[28:13.62]Oh, okay.
[28:15.60]What the fuck?
[28:23.80]Okay, at least...
[28:25.52]He's gonna break out.
[28:35.48]Nothing else.
[28:43.85]Just checking.
[28:50.11]Six?
[28:51.58]Oh, that says guilty.
[28:52.79]I thought it was like six, whatever.
[29:05.67]Okay.
[29:09.20]What the hell is going on?
[29:22.52]Okay, um... Oh, bullets!
[29:36.45]Wasn't I just here?
[29:37.28]Uh-oh.
[29:42.72]It's a piano book.
[29:44.03]C-D-E-F-G-A-B.
[29:51.13]Somebody get a mental screenshot of that, please?
[29:56.48]Dead.
[30:02.89]Come on, give me a gun.
[30:03.99]Where's my gun?
[30:04.69]It's a toy piano.
[30:09.31]I should play a melody.
[30:24.13]Hold on.
[30:36.15]What else do I know?
[30:57.72]That's the copyright free Mario theme song.
[31:02.57]Do I even know what I need to play?
[31:18.42]Was that...
[31:20.89]Anybody got a mental screenshot?
[31:24.67]Oh, I have to play dead.
[31:26.15]I have to play dead.
[31:27.70]I get it.
[31:29.02]Alright, so we got a screenshot?
[31:32.22]D-E-A-D, yeah.
[31:38.89]I don't know.
[31:39.45]Guys, I don't know music.
[31:41.67]You would not know either.
[31:42.67]That's why they have to have a note for it.
[31:51.06]This is D. D-E-A-D D-E-A-D D-E-A-D
[32:01.37]D-E-A-D!
[32:04.28]Yeah.
[32:05.41]Oh, he doesn't know music theory!
[32:06.84]Shut up.
[32:08.02]You fucking idiots.
[32:10.26]It's a keycard!
[32:11.10]I wonder how it got here.
[32:12.07]Alright, I got the keycard.
[32:17.85]Keycard to what?
[32:20.52]Someone's going to break through this door, right?
[32:21.94]There's no way.
[32:27.64]Key card I found in the nursery hidden inside a toy piano.
[32:30.83]What is it a key card to?
[32:45.13]What the?
[32:56.92]Uh-oh.
[33:10.34]Why even fight though?
[33:19.60]Oh, that one's having some trouble.
[33:22.23]I'm going this way.
[33:22.98]Oh shit, there's a million of them.
[33:33.44]Elmo?
[33:44.74]Wait, there's health over there.
[33:50.65]Uh-oh.
[33:52.95]Alright, where's the locked door?
[33:53.86]In here?
[34:00.59]It's kind of, it barely sounds like Elmo.
[34:08.60]Key card.
[34:14.95]Security room.
[34:19.12]Oh shit, shotguns!
[34:19.99]Give me one!
[34:24.37]They've been teasing these shotguns the whole time.
[34:26.44]They even put ammo in front of it just to tease you.
[34:37.92]There, bullets are everywhere!
[34:39.14]This is Silent Hill 2 for kids?
[34:46.36]Dude, I don't know this is for kids, man.
[34:47.98]Uh, something big is over here.
[34:57.68]There's all this blood everywhere, all these scary things, all these monsters, like violence and... No, this is not a kid's game.
[35:24.19]I love that sound effect.
[35:29.75]It kind of sounds like the Yoshis are here.
[35:39.04]It was on a Nintendo platform.
[35:40.61]You have to have the Yoshis sing their song.
[35:51.49]The end.
[36:06.98]Give me a gun.
[36:10.78]Please get the shotgun.
[36:12.19]I just tried, the thing was locked.
[36:23.86]Wait, where am I going?
[36:25.57]Alright, I'm this way.
[36:27.18]The door to the right here was locked.
[36:28.83]Blocked off.
[36:30.76]I need to go straight over to here.
[36:39.71]This is blocked.
[36:46.79]inventory LOL we can still hit the heartbeat is it oh it's still on
[36:56.28]Yeah, let's turn it off.
[36:57.36]I hate it too.
[37:00.11]Alright, I think I'm going to just go straight and like wrap around and go here, I guess.
[37:05.18]I don't know.
[37:10.35]I'm just walking in random directions, guys.
[37:12.67]I'm not gonna be...
[37:14.03]I'm not gonna lie.
[37:18.94]Is there anything even in here?
[37:24.90]There's nothing even in here!
[37:33.82]Hungry cats?
[37:41.22]There's so much ammo!
[37:53.85]Alright.
[37:55.65]Hey!
[37:57.47]Got it.
[38:01.60]Where am I on the map?
[38:03.60]Okay, big long hallway.
[38:20.70]What the fuck, dude?
[38:21.94]I... Uh-oh!
[38:31.16]How did I... Stop it!
[38:35.59]No!
[38:36.75]Oh, I know, I've got a mackerel in my pocket, but leave me alone!
[38:40.39]No, nobody can have any of this!
[38:47.06]Yeah, I know I just opened up the deli turkey.
[38:49.31]I'm trying to make a sandwich for myself.
[38:52.88]I know you can't.
[38:53.70]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[38:54.74]Off the counter.
[38:55.73]No, I'm sorry.
[39:07.19]Where do I get this gun?
[39:12.75]I gotta move my setup in.
[39:15.26]Oh my god.
[39:17.71]The sunbeam is hitting me right in the eyes again.
[39:19.76]Hold on, I gotta go forward.
[39:20.87]If I go right here, I'm fine.
[39:36.45]Dude, you can time it.
[39:37.38]Go back to the other VOD where I complained about it.
[39:39.19]It's this exact same time.
[39:41.04]That's how you know it's not fake.
[39:43.57]It probably was the exact moment in Sundown or whatever the hell it is.
[39:51.37]Oh, shit.
[40:05.70]No!
[40:14.61]Where am I?
[40:15.89]Okay, I'm up here now.
[40:23.73]I could have gone the other way.
[40:31.87]Let me try the other way.
[40:41.79]Okay, that's good.
[40:42.40]It's locked.
[40:53.40]Anything else?
[40:56.76]Okay.
[40:58.09]More shotgun bullets, or...
[41:00.15]I think that has to be shotgun, right?
[41:03.09]Hey!
[41:20.52]You might need to take more pills.
[41:33.04]What the fuck?
[41:36.18]Alright, they dodge!
[41:37.30]You can't hit them!
[41:38.55]You can't-
[41:43.17]I'm gonna die!
[41:51.08]Good thing there was a shitload of fucking medical pills over here.
[42:06.30]Get the fuck away from me!
[42:09.94]Okay, I made it to chapter four.
[42:18.42]That kid is way too happy for what's going on.
[42:34.55]Don't worry guys, it's just a Yoshi.
[42:40.62]It's the blue Yoshi.
[42:58.24]I could have jumped over this.
[43:01.05]Alright, so I have to get to the elevator.
[43:02.38]Let me look at the map.
[43:06.69]Alright, we gotta get here.
[43:13.31]Hey!
[43:14.59]No, I don't-
[43:24.70]He's making too many jokes.
[43:25.71]He forgets what his keys do.
[43:31.19]Small key that I found with a notepad in the room I woke up in.
[43:36.52]A key to what, though?
[43:37.45]Like, a small key?
[43:45.36]I thought it was gonna be for one of the doors.
[43:48.17]It unlocks the safe.
[43:54.00]Okay, I was opening up doors and they were like, this door is locked, this door is locked.
[43:58.51]I thought it was going to be a key to a locked door.
[44:09.47]The handgun was in chapter two.
[44:11.72]You've made it somehow to four.
[44:14.12]Was the shotgun in chapter one?
[44:22.35]I just don't have a gun?
[44:23.47]You guys said this was a kid's game.
[44:27.47]How am I supposed to miss the gun?
[44:35.82]I don't even need it.
[44:39.44]It was in chapter two.
[44:46.18]Well, is there an, okay, there's gotta be like a disk thrower that's in chapter five or something, right?
[44:54.46]We're gonna get a weird item, alright?
[44:56.71]This pistol, shotgun, disk thrower.
[45:07.56]like saw blades or something, right?
[45:09.72]Let's give me something weird.
[45:26.81]You were staring at the shotgun?
[45:29.82]Yeah, but it was locked.
[45:32.11]But every other door was locked.
[45:33.97]I didn't know that's what the fucking...
[45:36.06]I thought the key was through a door.
[45:42.27]That does not look like the key to a gun case.
[45:45.06]That looks like the key to a locked small door.
[45:52.41]That was during the part of the playthrough where I went into a door and it was like, this door is locked.
[45:55.79]So I was like, okay, so that's the first time I've come across a locked door.
[45:59.03]That must be for that.
[46:00.28]I thought that was going to be like a code for the case.
[46:04.09]And you know what?
[46:04.96]Who gives a shit?
[46:06.16]Hey, look at that, everybody.
[46:08.71]Oh, would you look at that?
[46:11.21]Hey, wow, how right can you be?
[46:14.65]Sorry, everybody, but you need to sit back down because literally it's exactly what I said.
[46:19.77]Exactly to the second I was ready for the game.
[46:23.19]The password is 123.
[46:24.66]If that's true, you're crazy.
[46:29.67]I told you!
[46:30.69]Whatever.
[46:32.05]Ohhhh.
[46:42.85]in the morgue.
[46:52.82]Sounds like you're using a soundboard of yourself.
[46:55.37]Yeah, everybody makes that joke every fucking afternoon, alright?
[47:02.76]uh alright that's two three four
[47:13.18]5, 6 7, 8
[47:24.55]10, 12,
[47:31.94]12?
[47:32.16]012?
[47:34.31]It's three numbers.
[47:47.60]How many I's, right?
[47:50.76]It'd be 0, 1, 2.
[47:53.85]1, 2.
[47:54.68]That's 2.
[47:56.58]Four.
[47:57.06]Nobody up top, right?
[47:59.63]Two, four.
[48:00.77]Six.
[48:04.65]Eight.
[48:05.55]Ten.
[48:09.08]12.
[48:09.32]Alright, so it's 012, right?
[48:13.87]It has to be.
[48:22.55]Okay.
[48:24.62]That person was actually kind of close to it being 1, 2, 3, if this is real.
[48:28.49]Yeah.
[48:28.91]You know what?
[48:29.96]You were... You pretty much were there.
[48:33.96]Instead of 1, 2, 3, it was 0, 1, 2.
[48:36.29]Oh my god.
[48:40.50]Alright, let's go.
[48:49.04]Can I put the light on it?
[48:55.78]In computer code, that is actually the same as 123.
[48:59.57]It's true.
[49:03.21]How are you supposed to shoot in the dark?
[49:05.96]You need a light on this.
[49:17.95]Works pretty good.
[49:22.69]That was a different one.
[49:23.48]That's a different zombie.
[49:25.85]He's got acid spit.
[49:32.41]Alright, that's an acid spit zombie.
[49:34.75]They should have given him green jeans.
[49:45.24]Now there's no shotgun shells anymore.
[49:49.02]Headshots are a waste in case you haven't noticed.
[49:51.09]Yeah, I have noticed that.
[49:59.12]Nice.
[50:12.47]Hey, what did I miss?
[50:13.66]Jermaniacs!
[50:21.64]We're just hanging out.
[50:26.18]Anything else in here?
[50:31.14]I want to fight a boss.
[50:47.86]Hey.
[50:49.58]No, it's wasting ammo.
[50:56.07]The fuck is that?
[51:01.60]That was a horrible sound.
[51:02.92]Where am I?
[51:10.39]Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm just trying, it's, the arrow is that way.
[51:13.62]Alright, so this is gonna be locked.
[51:18.32]I only have six bullets.
[51:22.05]Yep, okay.
[51:23.75]It's gonna break through, right?
[51:25.04]I'm ready for it to explode through.
[51:29.48]No?
[51:29.86]Alright, well, let's go.
[51:46.08]The Yoshis are gone.
[51:47.03]I'm not, this is, I don't like this.
[52:09.16]Stop it!
[52:11.53]Stop.
[52:13.06]Stop.
[52:15.13]I can't even collect any items.
[52:18.56]Doesn't even- I don't even have that.
[52:20.13]Oh no!
[52:20.75]Ooh!
[52:24.69]Alright, this is definitely a prepare-you-for-a-boss area, right?
[52:27.32]Like, look at all this shit.
[52:31.25]Is there a save point?
[52:32.48]Or do I have to just get it done in one go?
[52:37.27]Oh my god, that's so many.
[52:38.83]Okay, I have like a hundred bullets now.
[52:45.19]Alright, let's go.
[52:46.59]Whatever it is, I'm ready for it.
[52:55.25]Like a Binding of Isaac enemy.
[53:02.22]Am I dead?
[53:05.05]Um, what?
[53:08.92]What is he doing?
[53:11.84]This music, I don't...
[53:17.80]He's faster than me!
[53:19.12]Is there a sprint?
[53:27.85]Where'd he go?
[53:28.31]Where'd he go?
[53:29.56]Where'd he go?
[53:30.46]Where'd he go?
[53:32.95]Is there any more health?
[53:41.99]Stop, please.
[53:43.52]He's faster than me.
[53:49.30]Oh, why is there no sprint?
[53:58.97]I just lapped him like fucking Toad in Mario Kart.
[54:05.81]Oh shit!
[54:17.19]Get away from me.
[54:25.92]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[54:26.96]Where is he?
[54:27.65]Ah!
[54:30.63]Dude, that was a crit.
[54:48.36]Oh, he's right behind me
[54:57.83]Ah!
[54:59.08]No!
[54:59.43]No, no, no.
[54:59.81]Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
[55:03.89]Okay, he can't take damage when he's taken damage before previously, in the previous few seconds.
[55:24.85]What the fuck was that?
[55:37.37]Alright, I got him!
[55:40.66]What'd he drop, anything?
[55:44.65]Why do I assume they're gonna drop something?
[55:48.62]Video games, current video games have ruined, just messed up my brain when it comes to video games in general.
[55:57.57]Alright, I got him.
[55:58.46]He's dead.
[55:59.02]Anything else in here?
[56:09.53]I think I'm good.
[56:12.31]Which door did I even come in?
[56:18.66]I think it's this one that I have to go into?
[56:27.96]Yep, there's the elevator.
[56:28.94]Alright, anything else?
[56:34.68]Oh my god, it's the green needle.
[56:41.74]Can I go?
[56:52.97]How do I use the elevator?
[56:59.58]Oh, there's a button.
[57:01.32]Should I go to 1?
[57:02.41]It wants me to go to 1.
[57:12.24]That shit's going crazy.
[57:13.51]I don't think we're going off at one, boys and girls.
[57:24.32]Don't go to one.
[57:25.21]No, you're cooked.
[57:27.70]Are you serious?
[57:28.32]Should I not go to one?
[57:48.05]I made it out!
[57:49.70]I got out of the, um... Was it the hospital?
[57:51.99]I don't even know where the fuck it was.
[58:06.85]Give me that!
[58:08.87]It's a granny like?
[58:09.80]No, it's not.
[58:11.00]Absolutely not.
[58:12.85]It's an iron key.
[58:17.16]This is not a granny leg.
[58:18.86]That's a complete total miscategorization.
[58:25.93]Hold on.
[58:28.02]Let me just look around, right?
[58:29.76]Like there's this whole sewer system over there.
[58:46.20]Silent Hill for kids.
[58:49.21]This is not for kids.
[58:52.15]Not even, this is not.
[58:59.87]Iron door?
[59:00.69]Oh.
[59:06.68]Should I do this yet?
[59:21.25]Maybe I shouldn't do this.
[59:24.94]What's it look like on the... Oh, there's no map.
[59:26.43]Okay.
[59:34.56]Okay, weird.
[59:40.66]Try explore more outside?
[59:49.60]A photograph fragment.
[59:54.37]Torn piece of a photo.
[59:55.36]It is of a woman.
[59:56.22]She looks familiar.
[59:57.18]The number 31 has been scratched into it.
[60:03.57]Oh, code.
[60:08.67]I thought it was gonna be 3131.
[60:19.38]Okay.
[60:19.81]Well, I got to find the other pieces.
[60:30.38]There was another roof axis that I could have gone to.
[60:42.11]It's back this way, right?
[60:45.25]Wait.
[60:47.97]Did that just like turn me back around?
[60:50.50]This game is cozy.
[60:52.61]I like it.
[60:53.10]I think it's cute.
[60:55.14]Okay, I'm on the other side of the gate.
[60:56.51]What's the point of the gate then?
[60:58.64]You can just go through the roof.
[61:06.36]Wait, am I crazy?
[61:22.36]Isn't this like flipped?
[61:25.96]Hold on, what?
[61:27.99]The photograph piece, wasn't the whole thing flipped?
[61:34.59]It was.
[61:35.14]This is different.
[61:38.33]It is a different roof.
[61:43.76]Okay, well... Two different sides, but it's the same... code.
[61:50.47]I thought there was gonna be another fragment on the other roof.
[61:54.02]Okay, well, where the hell do I go?
[62:01.05]Okay.
[62:01.78]There's no map here, so I can't really...
[62:03.45]I did that, did that, so I guess I'm gonna go...
[62:10.42]through here and then into the other door?
[62:23.68]Because that's the roof axis over there.
[62:25.55]So where does this one go?
[62:28.77]What is this one?
[62:42.40]It's the exact kind of song that I like.
[62:48.35]This book has its original title scratched out.
[62:51.59]Third Floor West Building is written beneath it.
[62:59.51]Third floor, west building.
[63:05.28]Third floor, west building.
[63:08.23]Up there maybe?
[63:09.90]Somebody get a screenshot of that.
[63:18.21]So I'm gonna break through glass and attack me.
[63:24.33]This kind of sounds like this shit that I was doing on the piano.
[63:27.50]Oh, wait a minute.
[63:30.20]Guard Tower is written beneath that one.
[63:34.32]That was a green book.
[64:01.24]Looks like there's a photograph missing.
[64:04.70]Ah, this is where you put the photo.
[64:06.13]So there's three pieces.
[64:12.73]Is this telling you where they all are?
[64:14.90]Guard tower.
[64:18.47]It's definitely telling you where they all are.
[64:28.41]Mm-hmm.
[64:38.83]I'm ready.
[64:41.81]Oh, what the?
[64:43.30]I wanted to read that.
[64:47.42]The torn piece at the west elevator.
[64:50.72]Man with no face, number 10.
[64:52.67]It's 10-31.
[64:59.73]And is it west?
[65:01.21]Okay.
[65:02.72]It wants me to go to five.
[65:04.35]Should I go there?
[65:04.90]Okay.
[65:09.34]I'm distracted.
[65:16.19]This game is scary, dude.
[65:21.17]It's 1031 is Halloween.
[65:23.54]That's true.
[65:26.19]Did I miss my opportunity?
[65:29.86]Did I miss my opportunity to do whatever that was?
[65:31.50]I got like a chapter complete thing.
[65:39.72]Oh, west building, fifth floor.
[65:45.06]You probably just go back there afterwards.
[65:46.37]What does that say?
[65:47.75]Pharmacy.
[65:55.43]I need bullets.
[66:01.98]Why am I kind of invested in this game?
[66:14.60]Alright, what door?
[66:17.46]Uh, I'm gonna say the left one.
[66:28.27]Okay, that's good.
[66:31.02]I think it's a save point, maybe?
[66:43.09]I would love some shotgun shells if you could give them to me.
[66:47.19]I can't believe I never got the handgun.
[66:48.68]I should go get it.
[66:53.89]Right?
[67:00.60]Guys, the handgun is what they have in the trailer.
[67:02.50]I don't even have the trailer item.
[67:08.20]Red bordered rooms are save points.
[67:10.71]Oh, that makes sense.
[67:12.39]It's way too far back.
[67:17.61]Is it?
[67:28.09]Alright, this is to go up that way.
[67:29.82]Do I want to...
[67:32.97]I don't think there's any other way I can go here.
[67:34.65]I go straight and then...
[67:36.54]Hold on, let me do this.
[67:42.03]Did I go in this room?
[67:46.73]I don't think so.
[67:51.18]Ugh!
[67:56.68]Oh, handgun.
[68:07.19]It needs three keys.
[68:13.25]What?
[68:20.59]In an effort to stop him from using the instrument, I have hidden the keys to the case.
[68:25.05]It is a granny leg.
[68:26.37]The gold key is in the southwest stairwell.
[68:30.34]Okay, can I get a mental screenshot of this, please?
[68:33.83]Gold Key Southwest Stairwell.
[68:35.50]I need you guys to remember that.
[68:40.99]We took an oath to do no harm, and this is the test of that oath.
[68:43.80]Maybe I'll talk to you about a softer approach.
[68:45.78]That's not where a key is.
[68:46.87]Why would you even write this without putting in bold letters?
[68:49.68]Blue key.
[68:50.98]In office.
[68:55.30]He's in nightmares, not cures.
[68:57.02]He said it's necessary that they must face the horror.
[68:59.03]He's mad.
[69:03.27]Okay, the bronze key was accidentally consumed by one of the patients this morning.
[69:09.09]I'll be monitoring the men's bathroom near the staff lounge.
[69:13.44]Okay, men's bathroom near the staff lounge.
[69:16.16]Remember that for the bronze key.
[69:24.65]Can't sleep anymore no matter how many pills I take.
[69:26.54]The images won't leave my mind when I close my eyes.
[69:28.85]I regret ever getting involved with this.
[69:33.24]It's gonna be in the toilet with a hee-hee on it.
[69:36.58]That is kind of a hee-hee.
[69:40.37]I get gold key, bronze key.
[69:42.90]Where's blue key?
[69:49.12]Is there a hint for the blue key?
[69:56.76]The silver key is kept in my colleague's office nearest the exit to the central walkway.
[70:05.87]office, nearest the exit to the central walkway.
[70:14.83]Write that down too.
[70:15.86]You guys have a notepad open?
[70:28.47]Nah, dude, I'm playing Q-Bert.
[70:30.58]Well, just remember it.
[70:32.67]What the fuck are these things?
[70:37.07]Uh, hold on.
[70:38.34]I need a save point.
[70:44.76]Ugh!
[70:50.78]I think I have to shoot some of them.
[70:54.57]I guess not.
[70:57.56]Map, alright.
[70:58.86]What?
[70:59.64]What were they?
[71:14.23]He's not even dead!
[71:15.02]I shot his head off!
[71:16.30]Oh my god.
[71:16.98]I have no bullets left.
[71:22.94]Southwest staircase.
[71:26.01]Okay.
[71:27.46]South- so the staircase over here.
[71:29.17]Southwest staircase?
[71:31.32]That's where we're going.
[71:43.48]Oh, thank God.
[71:48.06]Three, four, five, six, eight.
[71:56.64]Okay, to bounce over here to the right.
[72:01.22]Shut up!
[72:02.58]Shut up!
[72:05.48]Alright, the key...
[72:09.09]That key is apparently in here somewhere.
[72:12.65]Got it.
[72:13.41]Gold key.
[72:15.26]Hell yeah.
[72:16.75]Alright, I got that one.
[72:24.13]The next one was...
[72:28.01]The game is going to want me to probably just go this way and to the left.
[72:31.75]Down the hall to the left.
[72:33.54]Or maybe straight ahead is the safe point over there.
[72:42.94]This is Gruntilda from Banjo-Kazooie.
[72:47.66]It's very similar.
[72:50.45]Oh, yeah.
[72:51.87]Save point.
[72:57.46]Don't go get the handgun, it's too far away.
[72:59.13]Are you sure I can't just go in the elevator and just go get it off the ground?
[73:05.71]I don't know where it would be, but what's stopping me from just going to the elevator and just going to get it?
[73:16.37]They all respawn.
[73:17.50]Enemies all respawn.
[73:19.13]It was apparently on the roof in Chapter 2.
[73:21.48]What?!
[73:23.41]!
[73:24.39]That was ages ago.
[73:25.84]That was at the beginning of the stream.
[73:27.33]That was the first place I went to.
[73:33.79]Did I just skip over three chapters?
[73:35.82]Because this one's taking a little longer.
[73:40.16]Okay.
[73:40.90]What were the other two keys?
[73:43.96]The trail of blood went off to one side and you went down the main path.
[73:49.33]Fuck.
[73:52.50]Okay.
[73:57.35]You didn't go in the blood trail room.
[73:59.08]See, I thought that's where the blood originated from.
[74:02.83]You have to go to the staff poo-poo room.
[74:05.22]I mean, that was childish, but fine.
[74:07.69]That gave me the information that I was looking for.
[74:09.40]What staff room?
[74:12.31]Nothing's labeled.
[74:14.33]There's nothing labeled.
[74:15.06]How am I going to know what a staff room is on here?
[74:18.63]I'm gonna go straight, I'm gonna go this way.
[74:26.00]Okay, you can't go this way.
[74:32.89]Ah, shut up!
[74:38.17]Okay, I'm just looking.
[74:40.34]Get off me!
[74:45.17]So it just is this way where I can go right.
[74:48.04]Techno.
[74:50.70]Okay.
[74:50.82]So can I go this way?
[74:52.63]I can.
[74:53.35]What happens if I try this?
[74:55.58]This works.
[74:58.99]And this leads to... Is this a staff room?
[75:02.83]This could be a staff room.
[75:03.73]This is like a kitchen staff room, right?
[75:13.47]This is a staff room!
[75:18.49]Is this a staff room?
[75:20.69]Staff only.
[75:21.87]Oh.
[75:30.16]Guess not.
[75:31.40]So where does this go?
[75:36.44]I haven't been in here yet.
[75:43.88]Staff security room.
[75:48.78]Look at all these bullets.
[75:51.23]How do I not have the handgun?
[75:59.57]It was in the poo room Hold on
[76:12.19]Shit!
[76:12.90]This is another bathroom, but it's blocked.
[76:20.83]Where are the other bathrooms?
[76:23.47]Bathrooms down here, it's not in these ones.
[76:25.72]These bathrooms you can't get into.
[76:32.68]Beware.
[76:41.35]The save rooms are the staff rooms.
[76:45.31]So if I go this way, I wonder if there's a bathroom up there?
[76:49.37]Might be on a different floor too.
[76:52.54]Let me see, where are all the bathrooms on each floor?
[76:59.11]I don't see a bathroom on this one.
[77:06.19]I guess this could be, I don't know.
[77:10.35]left side of the map underneath the big long room.
[77:14.08]Oh, those are bathrooms right there.
[77:16.25]Alright, so if I back up, go this way across,
[77:22.01]Wait.
[77:24.49]There's items in here.
[77:25.10]Hold on.
[77:29.74]This was originally supposed to be a Silent Hill game?
[77:34.21]That'd be kind of crazy if it was.
[77:38.17]Okay.
[77:39.08]I know where I'm going.
[77:41.60]It's up, left, straight across.
[77:58.78]What is this copypasta people are doing right now?
[78:02.03]Whose idea was it to do this?
[78:03.50]I'm going to read this, and if it's cringed, you're banned for a week.
[78:10.27]Hold on, this looks already like, I'm seeing like, oh, like a turtle.
[78:13.97]Like this seems like it's a bannable offense for at least a few days.
[78:17.27]Let's see.
[78:17.97]Jerma fleece saved from the turtle trap inside the computer and you'll be freed via extreme sports competition with streamers.
[78:24.70]And Jeremy, I hope you're reading this.
[78:26.13]Yeah, that's a four-day timeout, I think.
[78:30.25]Okay, the original poster, that's a one-hour ban, and everybody reposting it is five minutes.
[78:38.55]100%.
[78:43.95]Alright.
[78:53.32]Stop!
[78:57.02]Oh my god.
[78:58.14]Oh!
[79:00.21]Am I going the right way?
[79:04.79]Shit, this is the complete wrong way.
[79:10.38]I just got a raid.
[79:11.28]A raid from Vidal.
[79:17.40]Holy shit, what's up?
[79:19.60]What's going on, everybody?
[79:28.97]Welcome, welcome.
[79:31.56]On behalf of NeuroSamo.
[79:34.78]Oh, hello.
[79:37.97]That was the raid message?
[79:41.03]Oh.
[79:46.81]All of you are getting fucking banned, alright?
[79:49.36]Sorry.
[79:50.72]You're all getting timed out for probably 10 minutes or something like that.
[79:54.39]It still deserves a ban.
[79:59.08]I thought somebody was just writing that.
[80:00.68]Like, I was like, why are they writing this?
[80:02.55]I didn't know that was a raid message.
[80:04.01]Alright, well, that's a cool...
[80:05.30]Thank you for the raid.
[80:06.16]Appreciate it.
[80:07.60]Welcome, everybody.
[80:08.77]I thought somebody was just writing that over here.
[80:10.41]Somebody came over preemptively before the raid and did that.
[80:13.62]And I thought that was just a random fucking weird person in my chat.
[80:16.93]So...
[80:17.69]I apologize for banning everybody that came in on the right.
[80:24.83]Thanks for the very welcome.
[80:26.40]We're playing Dementium the Ward.
[80:32.20]This is a DS game or it was a DS game until it was ported to the personal computer CD-ROM entertainment system.
[80:44.52]It's pretty fun so far.
[80:45.63]I like it.
[80:49.47]Oh, now the mouse is on the screen.
[80:50.93]Get that off of here.
[80:53.03]There we go.
[80:54.28]Yeah, welcome.
[80:54.85]Thanks for the raid.
[80:55.78]Hope you had a good stream.
[80:59.98]There's a wild way to refer to the PC as a console, the personal computer entertainment console system.
[81:05.86]The PC, the PCE,
[81:11.02]Where's the computer internet?
[81:12.38]The P-C-E-C-S.
[81:16.40]Okay, where the fuck am I going?
[81:18.27]Wrong way again.
[81:21.61]There's a save point in here.
[81:22.72]Where?
[81:23.26]Oh!
[81:27.83]Okay.
[81:28.23]To the right, straight, and left at the intersection.
[81:32.85]Right?
[81:34.21]Yes.
[81:36.06]Watch out for the bugs.
[81:40.70]That's a bad idea, and I'm gonna take more damage than I got for getting that.
[81:45.78]Yep, I told you.
[81:47.09]Ooh, thank god.
[81:50.74]Okay, now it's straight, straight, right, left, left.
[81:58.64]If this chatter was lying to me, I want them permanently banned from the community.
[82:06.84]I'm in like a ban- I'm in a ban happy mood right now, I'm sorry.
[82:10.00]But I am.
[82:11.19]Why am I apologizing?
[82:12.20]Ban him!
[82:19.14]Why do you ban people so often?
[82:21.96]Because it makes me feel big, okay?
[82:23.62]It makes me feel big!
[82:34.50]I thought that was a grenade.
[82:44.05]Okay, I got all the... Alright, so this is a left here.
[82:47.63]What's straight across?
[82:49.33]No.
[82:50.18]I'm not going to get sidetracked.
[82:51.10]I'm just going to go for it.
[82:55.49]then it's around here and there should be bathrooms that I can go in.
[82:59.12]Oh, God damn it.
[83:07.44]I have to go through here.
[83:08.60]The loudest shotgun ever.
[83:24.40]Alright, into here.
[83:26.55]And then to the left.
[83:27.37]This is gonna be a big room with a bunch of scary stuff.
[83:31.41]Shine the light on them, they'll run.
[83:43.18]Get out of here!
[83:49.03]I can't believe...
[83:50.36]I, like, timed out an entire community of people.
[83:59.94]I'm sorry.
[84:03.15]Okay, we're good.
[84:07.59]Here we go!
[84:13.15]We deserved it.
[84:16.35]Alright, we're looking for the key.
[84:18.40]Bugs!
[84:19.53]They're flying bugs!
[84:24.02]What do I do?
[84:24.72]Just get the key and run out.
[84:27.61]Did I get it?
[84:37.28]We're good.
[84:40.92]So there's one more key.
[84:44.87]Staffram, stairwell,
[84:52.16]And what else?
[84:54.23]Bathroom keys got?
[84:59.16]They were just Christmas caroling.
[85:02.46]I just slammed the door on a bunch of Christmas carolers.
[85:11.67]The concept of slamming the door on Christmas carolers is actually kind of funny to me.
[85:18.79]Because, you know what?
[85:20.10]Let me be really honest.
[85:21.71]I feel like that would be kind of fucking irritating.
[85:25.40]It's like, oh, like, knock, knock, knock.
[85:26.73]There's somebody at the door.
[85:27.49]Ah!
[85:29.12]Dog is barking.
[85:30.00]Oh, hold on.
[85:31.07]Coming.
[85:32.35]And it's like, you're almost like you're obligated to sit there while people just sing in your doorway.
[85:37.94]Just like...
[85:40.41]On the rooftop, reindeer paws.
[85:42.46]Here comes good hearts.
[85:43.64]You can't be like, hey, hey, excellent.
[85:47.58]You kind of have to sit there.
[85:49.03]You can't...
[85:50.62]It's kind of like they're making you have to take the time to sit there because you can't just, if you close the door, you're a dick.
[86:01.55]And then at the end of it, I kind of be like, alright, so now where do we go from here?
[86:05.59]Do I talk or do you?
[86:08.06]That's never happened ever.
[86:09.87]Does this even happen to people?
[86:13.74]Has this ever happened to anyone besides in a 90s Christmas comedy movie?
[86:17.57]Does this happen?
[86:18.49]Has it ever happened?
[86:24.45]Maybe in the 70s?
[86:30.51]Do they do a whole concert?
[86:31.68]How long do they do it for?
[86:32.75]Is it one song or do you just kind of sit there
[86:35.41]It's like sitting in the door with a coffee in your slippers while they do like a 30 minute concert in your doorway.
[86:42.42]Alright, I'm gonna play.
[86:45.33]Do you pay them after?
[86:46.39]No, that means they have to be prepaid, right?
[86:53.39]That's the first thing you ask?
[86:56.57]Oh, hi, Christmas carolers!
[87:00.05]You guys been paid?
[87:01.42]Somebody paid you, right?
[87:03.55]Oh, uh, absolutely.
[87:05.38]Alright, then.
[87:06.51]Hey, let's get the whole family in here.
[87:08.53]Go ahead.
[87:20.83]Have you guys been paid yet?
[87:23.13]No, we're just doing it for the sake of Christmas cheer.
[87:26.13]Alright, well, you're full of shit, so I don't know how much you're gonna charge at the end of this or how much you're gonna expect, but I'm not ready for that.
[87:39.31]You just gotta give me a number.
[87:47.30]Ebenezer Scrooge.
[87:50.04]I didn't say bah humbug.
[87:51.78]I just said, has someone paid you yet so I can be prepared?
[87:57.69]Okay.
[87:58.07]Where am I going?
[87:59.45]What was the clue to the last key?
[88:06.04]You guys took a mental screenshot, right?
[88:07.46]What was it?
[88:16.86]They do it for the love of the game, unfortunately.
[88:18.72]That's not an unfortunately, though.
[88:20.19]That's... Alright, so that is a Bah Humbug.
[88:22.60]You just said Bah Humbug without writing that word.
[88:28.96]Southwest stairwell.
[88:30.06]I already got that key.
[88:31.45]Okay, you went to go make a sandwich and you came back.
[88:33.10]I got it already.
[88:35.65]Office near exit at Central Walkway.
[88:38.88]Alright, this is the central walkway.
[88:40.23]I mean, is it all on the fifth floor?
[88:41.86]I'm going to say it's one of these, right?
[88:48.90]Central something.
[88:52.07]I think it's gotta be like up here probably.
[88:54.64]Yeah, I think so.
[88:55.45]Yeah.
[88:57.09]No?
[88:58.72]This is blocked shit.
[89:00.15]Alright, so how do I get to the...
[89:02.40]If I wanted to go up here, I would need to go yoink, yoink, yoink, yoink.
[89:08.63]Alright, so we go back down.
[89:13.95]Then we go like this, yoink.
[89:19.11]And we bang a left up here.
[89:20.72]I know, I'm opening this like I did when I played Resident Evil 2 Remake, which is one of the best games of the year.
[89:26.17]Into 2023.
[89:32.98]Okay, I can't go this way either, so that means I have to go...
[89:35.25]This way?
[89:41.10]Oh, come on.
[89:44.86]How do I get over here?
[89:59.83]Why do you always play games where it looks like somebody played them in a movie or a TV show?
[90:03.04]I play what I want to play.
[90:05.89]Come on.
[90:07.32]Alright, so if I want to go up here...
[90:11.10]this is locked then I have to go how did I even get to the elevator from here
[90:17.29]down here right so that means I have to come through this door which means I have to go
[90:26.49]this way.
[90:27.84]So I have to get in here again, which means I got to go down.
[90:32.05]Oh my god.
[90:35.50]Don't let them change you.
[90:39.45]I feel like it's too late for me to change anything at 40.
[90:44.25]I mean, I kind of like, I've been, I kind of think the same things that I think since I've been like 30-something.
[90:50.03]I don't know if there's very much I'm gonna think differently of now.
[90:54.51]Alright, then we go left, straight, and then through here.
[90:56.82]We gotta go all the way back around.
[91:00.41]You got your whole life ahead of you?
[91:02.88]I didn't say my life was over.
[91:04.59]I just said that I'm kind of the man that I am.
[91:15.72]How old do you feel?
[91:18.17]You want the real answer?
[91:19.03]Definitely 40.
[91:19.61]100%.
[91:22.30]What the fuck?
[91:23.10]I can't even go this way.
[91:28.95]How do I get, oh, how did I get over here?
[91:31.08]This way?
[91:34.81]No.
[91:38.50]How do I get out of here?
[91:48.44]Can I go that way?
[91:49.72]No.
[91:55.11]How did I even get up here?
[92:00.28]Maybe the stairs and then go up?
[92:02.26]I don't know.
[92:03.50]I don't know.
[92:03.93]I'm just gonna go this way.
[92:12.42]Um, I definitely just feel like I'm 40.
[92:16.37]Okay, so now if I want to go...
[92:20.99]Should I just go down to the third floor and just try to go... Is there a way to go up from there?
[92:28.19]If I go third floor...
[92:30.49]And then maybe I can kind of like go around and up from the elevator, go up in the elevator.
[92:36.29]I'm just going to try that.
[92:39.04]What the fuck, dude?
[92:40.49]I- this- I can't go anywhere!
[92:44.14]I can't- this- I- this- I can't- they won't let me leave!
[92:48.24]Every single thing I want to do is not possible.
[92:51.02]What is possible?
[93:00.41]I'm actually trapped.
[93:09.05]Maybe I have to go up that way.
[93:11.17]Do I have to go that way?
[93:18.11]Nah, I don't think I'm softlocked, no way.
[93:25.37]I think I have to go like this.
[93:27.66]Yeah.
[93:28.34]That's definitely it.
[93:31.12]100%.
[93:31.36]100%.
[93:40.93]Yup.
[93:43.18]Yup.
[93:45.76]Uh, yup.
[93:53.55]Definitely.
[94:01.09]Yeah.
[94:01.96]Oh!
[94:03.49]No, no, don't fuck around.
[94:04.37]These things actually suck.
[94:05.20]Hold on.
[94:22.13]I'm armed.
[94:31.58].
[94:39.48].
[94:42.08]No!
[94:52.58]Oh, come on, man.
[94:53.72]You're going to spit acid at me now.
[95:01.52]Come on, man.
[95:04.44]It's such bait to go get those.
[95:06.25]It really is.
[95:06.73]And it's locked.
[95:07.60]Of course it is.
[95:10.77]I'm where I want to be though.
[95:17.28]Just mark it on the map, right?
[95:18.41]Okay, so now left.
[95:20.76]I can probably go all the way around here.
[95:30.29]Hey!
[95:36.51]Yeah, come on, do it.
[95:42.53]I finally made it.
[95:49.41]Cool.
[95:50.03]So now I can go where I wanted to go in the first place, which is over here.
[95:55.58]Right?
[95:56.34]Because I wanted to go... Yep.
[95:59.60]So this has to be in one of these right here, right?
[96:06.19]I think there's going to be a key in here.
[96:09.46]I think, I think, I think it's it.
[96:10.82]I think I did it.
[96:15.44]Talking max bullets?
[96:17.15]Well, let's get another there in here, whatever.
[96:20.11]Does this change, does game ever change its setting?
[96:23.68]I don't, probably not.
[96:24.68]I mean, it's, it's a, I'd say no.
[96:29.84]It's a weird door.
[96:31.23]Why would there be a door right there?
[96:32.43]That's strange.
[96:36.07]Alright, not this one.
[96:39.16]The ward is in the title, so probably not.
[96:48.07]Was that actually not?
[96:49.81]Was it not in there?
[96:55.56]Shit.
[96:56.43]Wait a minute.
[96:56.94]Am I missing something in that one then?
[97:03.32]central hallway in one of the offices is it just buried somewhere hidden huh
[97:13.70]Because I don't think I'm ever going to get to the ones right here.
[97:20.79]Central hallway office is central walkway between the buildings.
[97:32.01]So...
[97:40.90]Uh, it's alright, whatever.
[97:51.05]Here comes the monster.
[97:58.56]It's those guys from Bloodborne.
[98:00.06]This is a boss!
[98:03.26]We got a banger coming up here, by the way.
[98:19.03]Where is he?
[98:19.67]Oh, Jesus!
[98:36.25]He just sits in the corner, he camps in the corner!
[98:43.44]Are you fucking kidding me?
[98:44.79]Move!
[98:45.48]How do I move him?
[99:05.84]Okay, I'm almost dead too though.
[99:17.51]Where is he?
[99:22.86]What the hell?
[99:23.52]He threw acid at me!
[99:31.06]Come this way.
[99:34.12]Die!
[99:42.84]This is the first time I've died in the whole game.
[99:48.39]With the weird singing cats, the weird Satanic Yoshis.
[99:54.62]Alright, well, I know what's over here now.
[100:07.82]I'll mess up your brain.
[100:10.80]You are not wanted here.
[100:18.55]Don't let him get away.
[100:33.74]Okay, it's much easier if you just follow them around and shoot them.
[100:50.33]Alright, well, cool.
[100:52.06]Now I can go to the way I want it to go.
[101:00.65]There's not a whole lot of fanfare when you kill a boss in this game, I will say.
[101:05.51]They kind of just die, and the game auto-saves, and it's just like, that's it, go, leave.
[101:08.84]Get out.
[101:09.33]You had your fun.
[101:09.93]Leave.
[101:26.47]I told you, see, look.
[101:29.60]Alright, so now what?
[101:30.54]Let's do it.
[101:30.96]Let's open that case.
[101:34.03]There it is.
[101:34.82]I got them all.
[101:37.59]Alright, now where was that case?
[101:39.97]It was outside in the courtyard, right?
[101:47.50]So I shouldn't do, I should do that first before anything else.
[101:54.58]Is it possible that I can just get back there by going this way?
[101:59.45]Was it actually on this floor or was it actually, was it in the courtyard court?
[102:04.13]Did I say courthouse?
[102:08.68]That southernmost bathroom is where it is?
[102:10.43]Like this one down here?
[102:13.27]Where was that?
[102:17.99]It's on the same floor.
[102:21.25]Down here?
[102:24.00]Let me just, let me backtrack because, wait, let me not backtrack yet because I actually might be able to go through here.
[102:32.08]Okay, so I can't really go through there.
[102:35.83]All the way on the other side of the map.
[102:38.52]I'm definitely not leaving until I do that though, so I will backtrack.
[102:50.19]This game was probably great on portable system, but this...
[102:54.38]This is not good.
[102:55.66]Damn, alright.
[103:01.63]This, this is not, you gave the extra, like almost like scripted content, like the scripted dialog response, you know what I mean?
[103:10.86]When you write, I've done, I did a lot too.
[103:15.72]That, like, this.
[103:16.65]This is not good.
[103:19.74]You gave that extra context?
[103:24.15]I love doing that.
[103:24.88]I always do that.
[103:27.35]Okay, so then where on the map is this actually?
[103:31.45]All the way to the southernmost area here?
[103:52.96]This came out on the Switch a while ago.
[103:54.53]Did it?
[103:58.68]Switch.
[104:01.99]The Nintendo Switch?
[104:06.72]I hope that was right.
[104:09.73]It is, okay.
[104:17.50]Alright, so now... Somebody said it's the southernmost bathroom.
[104:23.54]Was it?
[104:23.82]I feel like it was in an office.
[104:29.52]Is it right here?
[104:30.90]This room right here next to the bathroom?
[104:35.46]I want to say it's this one right here.
[104:40.65]Peepo Shrug.
[104:44.43]I think it is that one.
[104:46.63]I'll check it.
[104:47.08]Alright, so I gotta go straight...
[104:51.00]And then, okay, we just gotta go this way.
[104:57.68]Jerma, I'm bored.
[104:59.44]Well, that sounds like a you problem.
[105:03.69]Wait, what?
[105:04.40]Oops.
[105:04.92]Where'd I go?
[105:06.03]Wrong way.
[105:16.87]Alright, then straight, right,
[105:21.07]I want, whatever's in that, it's going to be a handgun in that case.
[105:23.90]I bet you nothing.
[105:25.95]I bet you nothing that it's in, that's what's in that case.
[105:32.05]Get it!
[105:32.59]Oh my god.
[105:40.73]Okay.
[105:42.01]Then we go left.
[105:46.94]And we go... Um...
[105:53.86]Shit.
[105:57.74]Can I get there from here?
[106:07.02]They have a lot of shotguns in this place.
[106:16.94]So technically, should I be able to go like this?
[106:20.18]Or is it blocked off?
[106:22.89]I think it might be blocked.
[106:27.12]Damn it!
[106:29.61]It's blocked!
[106:33.99]This way instead?
[106:44.85]I have to get this case.
[107:06.86]Use the jump button?
[107:12.26]I unbound it from my keyboard.
[107:13.98]I don't, I think I can't.
[107:18.96]I unbounded.
[107:24.64]Oh shit, you were right.
[107:25.85]Wait, what's this?
[107:26.99]Oh shit, let's go.
[107:28.10]Alright, get those keys in there.
[107:29.48]You ready?
[107:30.87]You guys ready for the reveal?
[107:31.93]What's in here?
[107:34.55]One.
[107:35.32]Two.
[107:36.26]Three.
[107:38.81]Magnum.
[107:42.33]and everybody laughed at me.
[107:44.32]Everybody laughed at me when I said I was gonna get a disk shooter for the next weapon.
[107:49.06]You all fucking laughed.
[107:50.03]You all question marked me.
[107:51.43]Now we're going to be shooting electric buzz saws.
[107:53.87]You all laughed at me.
[108:01.42]I got the...
[108:02.76]There was a disk shooter in every one of these games!
[108:04.97]This is 19, like, 90... 10, or whatever the hell it was.
[108:10.49]2010!
[108:12.30]Wait, is it just a...
[108:16.20]Does this have battery?
[108:26.32]It's a melee weapon.
[108:27.31]We gotta test it.
[108:36.94]Get him!
[108:40.82]Oh, fuck!
[108:43.32]I already hate this.
[108:45.77]It's so loud and it sucks.
[108:49.31]I need health.
[108:56.33]Play Ratchet and Clank?
[108:57.55]I've never played a Ratchet and Clank game in my entire life.
[109:01.17]Alright, now we gotta get all the way back to here.
[109:03.45]Which I went the wrong way.
[109:05.43]What else is new?
[109:22.67]Ratchet and Clank has disk shooters.
[109:24.48]Yeah, and guess what?
[109:25.40]Is it the third weapon you get in the game?
[109:27.03]Yeah.
[109:30.16]Pistol.
[109:31.16]No.
[109:31.71]Knife.
[109:33.33]Listen to me.
[109:35.24]Tier 1.
[109:36.28]Every game starts with this.
[109:37.70]Knife?
[109:38.61]Pipe?
[109:40.15]or crowbar type weapon.
[109:42.98]Knife or pipe.
[109:44.45]Knife, pipe is one.
[109:46.30]Two, pistol.
[109:48.45]Some type of handgun.
[109:49.30]3.
[109:50.76]Shotgun SMG.
[109:53.62]No.
[109:54.34]Two is...
[109:55.39]Wait a minute.
[109:56.11]One doesn't count because that's what you start with.
[109:58.22]One.
[109:58.56]Pistol?
[109:59.93]Handgun.
[110:01.03]Two.
[110:01.49]Shotgun SMG.
[110:02.98]Three.
[110:03.82]Disk shooter.
[110:05.50]Buzzsaw shooter.
[110:07.39]Three.
[110:09.62]Done.
[110:13.56]It's the third weapon in that game.
[110:14.83]Go look it up.
[110:23.28]I won't be using this weapon again.
[110:35.11]I'm glad I took all that time to get all those keys for the tinnitus weapon.
[110:42.39]Okay, so now... Fuck, I have to...
[110:45.49]to go all the way around.
[110:49.41]So we gotta go this way, straight all the way around to here.
[110:55.26]Okay, got it.
[111:00.02]I wish the map would mark the blocks.
[111:05.42]Can I even get there from here?
[111:06.63]I think so, right?
[111:11.02]This is going to be blocked, isn't it?
[111:15.29]Thank God it's not blocked.
[111:25.72]Okay, good.
[111:32.70]The game is totally demented.
[111:38.38]Experience the horror of the Nintendo 3DS.
[111:43.61]Find your way through the demented ward and solve the mysteries of the demented.
[111:52.82]Demented 3.
[111:54.74]Dementium The Ward.
[112:02.88]Do you have the stomach to do what's...
[112:06.03]Hold on.
[112:08.58]Can you stomach the horror that is Dementium III, The Ward?
[112:17.41]Okay, I know where to go now.
[112:28.29]I forgot about the music on that one.
[112:29.67]That one was crazy.
[112:33.34]Okay, I am ready to go to chapter seven, I think.
[112:46.03]Okay, any heals?
[112:47.27]Yep.
[112:48.26]Give me.
[112:49.69]How much shotguns do I have?
[112:51.60]Plenty of shotgun shells.
[112:53.89]We're out.
[113:06.41]That's good for them.
[113:07.32]Alright, where should I go?
[113:10.30]This way?
[113:16.89]Oh shit, hold on.
[113:22.32]Who's screaming?
[113:31.41]Everybody on the count of three, say how much we appreciate him.
[113:38.24]Nobody said anything.
[113:40.54]You were the- you were one guy!
[113:42.69]Did you even count it down?
[113:52.28]That's such a, that is a great chat message because like who gives a shit, right?
[113:56.76]No one's going to do that.
[113:57.97]I imagine one person just in their room just being like, let's do it.
[114:01.14]One, two, three.
[114:02.69]And then just say, nobody has said anything.
[114:08.50]Down to three.
[114:12.42]That's a kind chatter.
[114:14.26]Yeah.
[114:16.61]But you gotta be realistic.
[114:18.28]You gotta be realistic.
[114:25.16]You can't kill the bugs with this.
[114:29.24]Anything in here?
[114:32.04]What does it say?
[114:32.55]Nothing?
[114:43.48]Um, why would Chapter 7 say, welcome to Chapter 7 and put me in a room with a bathroom?
[114:49.35]And that's it.
[114:50.67]Wait.
[114:51.68]That's not even on the map.
[114:59.44]Okay, I hate how effective this is because I hate how loud it is.
[115:14.26]Are we done appreciating you?
[115:25.60]You don't have to do that.
[115:28.17]Don't do that.
[115:30.58]Hold on, there's a fucking guy over here.
[115:34.98]Lots of items.
[115:49.29]Alright, we gotta visit a big-ass area.
[115:58.25]you
[116:11.48]Alright, what do you think the boss of this level is gonna be?
[116:15.60]We got big guy and then we got little guy.
[116:19.08]I think it's gonna be something in between.
[116:20.10]I think it's gonna be a medium-sized guy.
[116:21.61]Or a fl- wait, wait, it's the third enemy?
[116:26.05]Third boss?
[116:26.89]It's gonna have wings.
[116:42.79]I'm so sorry with how good that weapon is and it's terrifying and horrible for your ears I'm sorry
[116:54.88].
[117:00.10].
[117:07.84]no I still don't have that I don't have the handgun
[117:22.88]Yes!
[117:29.94]Yeah, I'm thinking wings.
[117:31.35]Next boss will have wings.
[117:44.68]Oh, whatever, just go.
[117:52.43]I don't think any of these are gonna open.
[117:58.82]This one will.
[118:01.78]That one actually got me.
[118:03.63]It did.
[118:09.71]You put anything right in front of anybody and they're gonna do that.
[118:16.51]No healing potions though.
[118:28.46]No healing potions.
[118:31.88]That's pretty messed up.
[118:42.85]Yeah, that's twisted.
[118:50.10]No healing potions.
[118:53.53]That's a complaint.
[119:06.53]Fine.
[119:10.50]Why do you keep saying it?
[119:12.07]I don't know, because what else am I going to say right now?
[119:15.71]I gotta fill the dead air.
[119:23.70]Fill the dead air.
[119:24.70]Say it twice!
[119:35.40]Gross.
[119:45.68]Nothing.
[120:02.26]Is something breaking out of this thing?
[120:07.35]No?
[120:09.91]Okay.
[120:11.31]How many chapters did you guys say this was?
[120:16.00]Somebody said 16?
[120:23.21]We're halfway through the game right now.
[120:28.22]I mean, am I going to beat this today?
[120:30.09]I don't know.
[120:40.87]I anticipated I was going to play this for maybe an hour, but I'm still here.
[120:46.78]We're going to be playing Withering Rooms whenever I move to Withering Rooms.
[121:03.44]Getting there.
[121:10.60]There we go.
[121:11.00]Health.
[121:11.58]Thank you.
[121:21.90]A room with a room on it.
[121:32.31]I'm all the way down here.
[121:33.16]Shit.
[121:33.67]Okay.
[121:33.85]Well, whatever.
[121:49.71]Oh, come on, dude.
[121:51.18]Get outta here.
[121:52.04]Why have they, like, increased the amount of jump-in-your-face things?
[121:58.33]Wooden chairs, paintings, computer monitor, clock, trash can, newspaper.
[122:03.91]Looks like a checklist of some kind.
[122:05.66]Could this be some sort of code?
[122:15.00]Code to what?
[122:21.55]Is there gonna be a safe somewhere?
[122:22.73]Alright, do I have to count how many...
[122:24.94]Okay.
[122:26.15]Do I have to count how many chairs are on the whole fucking floor?
[122:30.88]I don't I'm not doing this you leave a coded message like this no one's gonna do it
[122:39.84]No way.
[122:42.43]I have to count every wooden chair, every trash can in the entire floor.
[122:47.91]No.
[122:48.65]Nope.
[122:49.70]Well, there's... And how many monitors?
[122:55.12]How am I even going to keep track of that?
[122:57.76]Look at how many rooms are in here.
[122:59.81]Not possible.
[123:00.88]Not happening.
[123:02.22]Well, we have one... No.
[123:03.93]I'm not doing...
[123:05.63]I'm not doing that.
[123:19.99]You're gonna spend more time complaining than in the time it would just take to do it.
[123:25.03]Well, actually, hold on.
[123:25.98]There's a lot of hallways here.
[123:32.05]Just that room?
[123:43.51]Okay.
[123:48.62]One.
[123:48.82]One.
[123:53.87]Where's the clock?
[123:57.05]Alright, painting.
[123:58.38]One.
[124:00.45]Two paintings.
[124:03.54]one trash can.
[124:16.57]Hold on.
[124:21.30]I'm going to write it down.
[124:27.15]Chairs.
[124:27.86]It's a chore even in one room.
[124:34.58]I'm not...
[124:35.92]Wait, there's two trash cans.
[124:42.58]Two chairs!
[124:43.64]There's three chairs!
[124:45.69]Stop, wait, maybe it is just one room.
[124:47.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:48.05]What do I need?
[124:48.61]Wooden chairs.
[124:50.39]One.
[124:51.73]Two.
[124:52.72]Three.
[124:55.12]Is there wood in this?
[124:55.78]That count- Is there wood on the bottom?
[124:57.85]Three wooden chairs.
[125:00.43]Okay, three.
[125:01.40]How many paintings?
[125:03.72]One.
[125:04.72]Two.
[125:11.03]Two paintings.
[125:15.33]Three paintings.
[125:18.25]Alright, two paintings, three chairs.
[125:23.22]One computer monitor.
[125:30.28]One, two trash cans.
[125:38.20]two trash cans, and newspaper clippings.
[125:43.07]One, two,
[125:48.34]Three.
[125:56.55]Three.
[125:58.24]So it's three, two, one.
[126:00.15]What about clock?
[126:06.55]There's no clock in here.
[126:15.32]Alright, one clock.
[126:17.09]So three, two, one, one, two, two.
[126:23.84]321122.
[126:31.55]That can't be that easy, right?
[126:33.06]3, 2, 1, 1, 3.
[126:35.47]I forget it.
[126:36.03]Just write it down in chat when I get to the part.
[126:38.34]You know, we did it.
[126:39.06]I did it.
[126:43.82]It's a capture game.
[126:52.65]Alright, I did it, I did it, I did it.
[126:53.88]Get me out of here.
[126:55.95]Where do I go from here?
[126:56.66]I know.
[127:03.06]Are you a robot?
[127:04.13]How many clocks are in this image?
[127:18.38]This shit is fucking demented, dude.
[127:20.77]I know!
[127:21.23]This is what I've been saying the whole time.
[127:23.12]People just like want to come in here and go, this is not even that demented.
[127:25.83]It's like kind of sane.
[127:28.63]It's like, bro, are you even watching the same thing?
[127:30.97]I think he's overreacting.
[127:33.58]It seems... Dude.
[127:38.63]A riddle you have missed.
[127:39.70]Take some time to look around.
[127:40.97]Someone's office may have the list.
[127:45.45]3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2.
[127:54.38]Uh-oh.
[127:57.75]Three, two, one, one, two, three?
[128:02.71]Yeah, that was the third newspaper.
[128:19.05]Thank you.
[128:30.00]more books.
[128:32.19]Hold on, that's for a
[128:35.30]Those are Atari 5200 fucking Pac-Man exclusive original 1977 cartridges.
[128:43.30]How could they have left it here?
[128:44.76]They left four of them here.
[128:48.74]Oh my god.
[128:53.15]Where's the machine gun?
[128:54.06]Because that's what those are for.
[128:55.94]You don't even need a machine gun.
[128:57.19]You don't need even half the guns in the game.
[128:58.74]You guys were mad that I missed the pistol.
[129:01.13]I didn't even need it.
[129:05.10]Anything else in here?
[129:12.98]I don't see a gun.
[129:16.54]Dude, machine gun.
[129:25.91]but without a light, it's useless.
[129:35.39]Is there an aim down sights?
[129:36.56]Why would there be?
[129:45.67]VRJosh, I really appreciate it.
[129:49.66]I think he said like, Pog, there's an Atari, actual Atari console in the locker.
[129:55.00]for me to see that and go, oh, wait, that means the gun's in the locker.
[130:13.60]Why even have guns in the game?
[130:18.04]Why not have a gun light attachment?
[130:41.74]I don't have enough health to fuck around.
[130:44.27]I'm hiding for a second.
[130:44.95]I need to look at the map.
[130:49.59]Okay, so it's just boom, down that hallway, straight across.
[130:57.45]Spray into the darkness.
[130:59.05]No, I don't want to use the bullets.
[131:09.03]Oops.
[131:30.53]No, give me the flashlight.
[131:31.89]Where's the flashlight?
[131:33.50]Where's my fucking light?
[131:35.23]Stop saying bad words.
[131:44.65]Okay, I just wanted to see if there's anything else I... Whatever.
[131:49.15]Oh my god, I respawned everything in the...
[131:55.93]I need health bad
[132:06.94]Why can't I open that?
[132:18.50]hmm whatever
[132:28.07]Definitely items in here.
[132:29.46]Oh my god, dude.
[132:35.91]Staircase on the right.
[132:39.29]No health.
[132:42.02]Come on!
[132:42.62]No!
[133:05.37]I actually can't die here.
[133:09.66]Where is he?
[133:27.86]Thank you.
[133:29.43].
[133:38.13].
[133:38.17].
[133:41.71]Where'd he go?
[133:52.82]This thing sucks!
[134:00.85].
[134:11.03]He disappeared.
[134:14.70]I need health, not bullets right now.
[134:21.56]you
[134:28.91]This song is literally just the vocoder preset holding down one key at a time.
[134:39.76]That's just when you get... Like back in the day when you got like Fruity Loops.
[134:48.17]And like, you know what, man, let's just, I'm going to make a fucking crazy ass song.
[134:51.96]And you open it with one of these.
[134:57.80]But to me, I would hold down two.
[135:03.79]I'd make a chord with this.
[135:09.21]I can't get hurt here
[135:17.75]Other way.
[135:18.86]I just respawned that guy, didn't I?
[135:20.91]Okay, here's the game plan.
[135:22.68]Run all the way as fast as I can to the straight ahead and go.
[135:29.85]Oh no!
[135:36.25]Stick to the plan.
[135:41.54]Health, health, health, I need it now.
[135:43.21]Health.
[135:44.11]Please.
[135:47.18]It's the kitchen, how is there no health packs in the kitchen or health food?
[135:54.27]There's no health food.
[135:58.57]They were everywhere in the first chapter.
[136:08.05]No, don't.
[136:09.88]Where is their health?
[136:14.42]Okay, save point right here.
[136:22.33]What?
[136:25.35]Okay.
[136:28.85]Uh...
[136:31.56]I might be dead if I get hit.
[136:32.97]This is a boss.
[136:36.60]Is it not a boss?
[136:39.01]Not really.
[136:43.80]Yeah, give me more machine gun ammo for no reason.
[136:49.37]Give me 5,000 bullets, but not a health pack.
[137:01.03]Whatever.
[137:01.51]I'm ready.
[137:10.34]Thank you.
[137:19.89]Oh shit.
[137:22.20]There wasn't a boss.
[137:24.13]Yes.
[137:27.85]The flashback.
[137:34.08]It's an old gramophone.
[137:35.59]It appears to be in working order.
[137:38.29]Got to play a disk on there.
[137:46.52]Just go save it again with the health.
[137:58.30]Jeremy, me and my girlfriend saw you from across the bar and we love your vibe.
[138:01.30]Don't talk to me.
[138:03.63]Get away from me.
[138:15.75]Is that you who sent this drink over?
[138:18.37]I sent it back.
[138:24.69]Like straight tequila with a splash of lime.
[138:26.99]No, I don't want to drink this.
[138:36.99]Who's drinking this?
[138:44.17]You order me a fucking margarita.
[138:46.02]Like a real... Like a real one, okay?
[139:04.31]This gun is awful.
[139:08.50]I'm not gonna equip it ever again.
[139:21.86]These things are green now.
[139:23.15]I want to see.
[139:23.67]I'm going to die.
[139:25.91]Oh, record.
[139:36.65]It's alright.
[139:45.47]The Bloodborne, the Dark Souls death sound.
[139:51.28]Yeah, that's the you fell off the cliff in Bloodborne.
[139:56.53]Alright.
[139:57.19]Where was that shit?
[139:58.03]It was down here.
[139:58.72]I don't know.
[139:59.26]I'm running past everything.
[140:00.30]Yeah, because none of the weapons are fucking worth using besides the teeth grinding one, and it hurts to use it.
[140:13.89]Fuck it, I'm using the shotgun.
[140:25.04]You have to shoot one bullet before you can shoot any others.
[140:37.46]Oh!
[140:46.78]I just keep thinking of holding down a button on the keyboard and nodding.
[140:51.65]Like, yeah, alright.
[140:56.87]But at some point you have to add the Two Fingers and then you add Three Fingers and it's like They haven't done that yet
[141:19.90]Worst gun in the whole game.
[141:20.83]This is the worst version of a machine gun out of any video game I've ever opened.
[141:41.22]Oh.
[141:46.56]Nice.
[141:59.34]Nice shooting.
[142:03.88]Auschwitz?
[142:04.52]That wasn't Auschwitz, you're right.
[142:14.66]I hate that you can't see it.
[142:15.89]I've seen people see DOOM 3.
[142:18.40]Is DOOM 3 actually like this?
[142:30.21]Okay, I got the device thing.
[142:32.40]Now I just gotta go back to that room and play it.
[142:42.96]Yep.
[142:45.27]Can you raise the brightness in the options?
[142:49.05]I think it's supposed to be a dark, scary kind of game, right?
[142:51.23]Should I?
[142:51.51]Let me see.
[142:52.22]Can I?
[142:57.81]There you go.
[143:00.99]I turned on the high-res CRT.
[143:03.24]That doesn't even look right anymore now.
[143:05.62]Hold on.
[143:18.96]Okay, I kind of like, why was I playing with the CRT on?
[143:30.69]No wonder I can't see anything.
[143:32.28]I can't see shit like this.
[143:41.15]It is supposed to be demented, that's true.
[143:45.29]I actually like CRT.
[143:48.44]Oh no, my immersion.
[143:52.72]You're talking to a guy that loves CRT, okay?
[143:56.86]This is not your opportunity now to be like, oh, yeah, CRT, Omega Law, fucking CRT nerds.
[144:03.05]Don't go there, because I like that shit, so don't fuck around here.
[144:16.40]Yeah.
[144:22.64]Yeah.
[144:24.35]This lady has been killed like eight times.
[144:30.86]We keep seeing this lady get killed.
[144:43.59]I love this music.
[144:45.37]Okay, so what's the...
[144:53.22]Is it just the walls?
[145:04.21]Hey!
[145:07.85]I can't- I can't die here.
[145:09.20]I'm not-
[145:25.91]Get them all away from me!
[145:27.28]Get away from me!
[145:28.89]I don't know what's real and what's not real!
[145:30.23]I don't know what's real and what's fake!
[145:32.26]Is that real?
[145:32.83]I don't know!
[145:45.08]No!
[145:55.96]Die!
[146:11.15]It's screaming like a person!
[146:26.02]Shoot it!
[146:37.49]I...
[146:49.66]I really do see cats.
[146:51.10]Where is it?
[146:54.35]I see cats all...
[146:55.86]Okay.
[146:56.65]I see a circle of cats with hoods.
[147:00.09]with their hands kind of inside of the hooded sweatshirt part of the hood down, like crossed arms.
[147:06.18]Sitting around a big circle singing this song.
[147:08.75]With like candles everywhere and like blood cuffs.
[147:20.59]Where is it?
[147:44.59]Look up, bro.
[147:46.05]Oh!
[148:03.32]I love this game.
[148:19.25]Thanks for watching!
[148:29.66]There's one more that's still alive.
[148:35.25]Right there.
[148:47.78]Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
[148:53.34]That was fucking loud, dude.
[148:55.03]That was so loud.
[148:56.17]It's not even funny.
[149:08.98]Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee
[149:18.50]The evil cat lair.
[149:36.77]Okay.
[149:39.93]I guess we're just gonna keep going.
[149:41.93]Chapter 9, probably?
[149:49.41]I need to take a break.
[149:51.34]So we're going to hit next save point.
[149:55.40]I'm going to break.
[149:58.66]Well where is it?
[150:10.51]Where is the other one?
[150:14.02]Die.
[150:18.50]Oh.
[150:21.01]Die.
[150:43.73]I'm gonna be thinking about that one for a while.
[151:05.48]These are the most annoying enemies.
[151:17.18]Am I poisoned?
[151:19.61]I better not be poisoned.
[151:22.87]So fucking annoying.
[151:25.84]So fucking aggravating.
[151:37.65]There we go.
[151:40.30]Good to go now.
[151:42.76]Alright, next chapter change.
[151:44.47]I'm taking a break.
[151:45.29]I'm back in like three, four minutes.
[151:49.04]I feel like that's coming up here pretty shortly when we get to like here.
[151:57.00]Thank you.
[152:06.71]Whatever.
[152:08.65]What the fuck are you talking about?
[152:16.83]Didn't even get hit.
[152:18.82]We're good.
[152:23.15]Is this open?
[152:24.98]Oh, demented.
[152:31.66]No!
[152:39.76]Where am I?
[152:41.26]Straight across?
[152:43.47]I think this is it.
[152:51.07]Pretty sure this is it.
[152:53.21]Okay.
[152:54.04]Can I go this way?
[152:55.43]No.
[153:07.54]Don't do that.
[153:09.96]Okay, goodbye.
[153:20.05]Okay.
[153:20.87]No, don't!
[153:36.79]Okay, now where does it want me to go?
[153:38.78]Should I have gone somewhere else?
[153:42.38]I think I just have to wrap back around.
[153:46.57]Did I get an item for beating that boss?
[153:48.06]I don't think I did.
[153:51.71]Okay, Chapter 9.
[153:52.49]The Hole in the Wall.
[154:02.82]Alright, I need to save room.
[154:04.64]There we go.
[154:05.05]Okay, the save point's right here.
[154:09.84]Dun dun dun dun.
[154:26.90]That's how you handle those enemies.
[154:38.80]Seeing the pistol ammo really just torments me now every time I see it.
[154:47.44]Oh my god, dude.
[154:57.58]Alright, cool.
[155:02.14]That's where we're at.
[155:03.24]Chapter nine out of 16, apparently.
[155:07.59]Been doing this for about two and a half hours.
[155:12.79]Hmm.
[155:13.65]Do I want to finish this game and only potentially have like an hour or so on Withering Rooms?
[155:19.81]Or do I move to withering rooms now?
[155:21.86]I don't know.
[155:22.36]I actually kind of, I'm actually interested in finishing this.
[155:27.60]I think we're this far.
[155:28.69]We've got another maybe third of the game, effectively.
[155:31.38]I think I'll finish this.
[155:37.71]You don't get to like chapter 10 and then just leave.
[155:41.89]So, okay, if it gets to a point where I'm not feeling it and it's like I'm done, then I'm done.
[155:46.15]But I think there's still more to see.
[155:51.62]So I'll be right back.
[155:52.56]Give me, I don't know, three or four minutes.
[155:56.74]I'll see you soon.
[165:38.01]Had to get a drink.
[165:45.88]I'd take our auto, too.
[165:52.67]Dude, your fly is down.
[165:54.50]I don't care.
[165:57.30]I don't care.
[166:00.92]I'm salami maxing right now?
[166:02.73]What does that mean?
[166:03.21]You eating a thing of salami?
[166:08.36]Hold on, let me crack my...
[166:10.16]I got a drink.
[166:18.12]I got an iced tea.
[166:24.94]Good stuff.
[166:27.50]Vodka cranberries?
[166:28.75]No, not right now.
[166:54.65]Uh, nope.
[167:07.73]Fell asleep most of the stream.
[167:08.80]My stomach hurts wicked bad.
[167:13.38]I would eat an easy to digest diet for the next few days.
[167:21.79]Don't eat any spicy foods.
[167:34.26]Alright, ready?
[167:35.66]Let's go.
[167:43.02]Chapter 9.
[167:49.83]Skibidi Son or La Boo Boo Daughter.
[167:53.55]Condoms.
[167:55.30]That's what I would choose there.
[168:01.90]Okay Which way should I go?
[168:11.97]Oh, fuck.
[168:12.52]We're on the VRB screen.
[168:13.59]Whoops.
[168:22.08]Alright, let's go.
[168:44.17]Is he gone?
[168:51.75]Alright, what dumb gimmick is- every floor has a gimmick.
[168:58.37]And what is it gonna be for this one?
[169:03.00]I thought that was, I thought that sofa was the right way up.
[169:07.64]Cigarette son or cigar daughter?
[169:12.77]Um, cigarettes on, I think.
[169:34.91]Pyro son or engineer daughter?
[169:36.87]Engineer daughter.
[169:37.57]Oh, yeah.
[169:45.61]Absolutely.
[169:46.46]There's no- I don't even have to think about that one.
[169:51.11]Alright, so let's go this way and then left.
[169:57.46]Sniper son or spy daughter?
[169:59.13]Spy daughter.
[170:01.49]Again, I don't even have to think about that one for one second.
[170:12.97]I don't know, I just see the same dude sitting at the end of Two Fort for like four hours.
[170:17.46]You know what I mean?
[170:17.95]I see the same guy just sitting there.
[170:20.27]When I think of, when I think of T, like sniper son.
[170:27.34]I see a guy just scoped in.
[170:30.28]sitting there on that same spot in 2fort.
[170:32.76]Then it irritates me, so that's why I picked the other one.
[170:43.26]Okay.
[170:44.74]Straight to the left.
[170:49.46]Can't go that way.
[170:56.02]Yo!
[171:05.01]I'm dying!
[171:13.62]Oh, thank goodness there's health pills everywhere.
[171:16.46]So how hard is this on demented difficulty?
[171:22.17]What do they do to make it so awful?
[171:27.64]Probably less ammo, right?
[171:32.89]This is all locked.
[171:44.80]It's cool that Jerma will respond to chatter.
[171:46.55]It's heartwarming.
[171:47.35]Do other streamers not respond to chat?
[171:50.64]I feel like a lot of people do.
[171:54.28]It's not necessarily unique to here.
[172:07.48]Not as often.
[172:08.27]I feel like everybody that I watch looks over and says stuff all the time.
[172:26.01]Alright, one, two, three.
[172:32.99]Dude, I got a challenge for you.
[172:35.78]Dementium the Ward without opening the map once.
[172:41.23]I'm not sure that's gonna- it's gonna be pretty difficult to do that.
[172:44.91]Okay, this says, if you dare, do what?
[172:49.09]Somebody smudged out the rest of the instructions!
[172:52.82]This probably said, turn on the light if you dare, but beware.
[172:58.09]Monsters are afoot.
[172:59.44]You fucked the whole thing up.
[173:00.59]This could have been scary and interesting.
[173:02.02]What do you mean, if you dare?
[173:08.60]There's a metal lever inside.
[173:09.99]I can't move it.
[173:11.18]It's too slick.
[173:12.98]I need to find something that will give me more grip.
[173:17.36]Just grab it.
[173:19.09]Give me, come on, give me a break.
[173:24.27]Alright, so that is down here.
[173:28.89]Okay, so I gotta find...
[173:30.04]I guess I didn't go this way.
[173:40.68]Don't.
[173:42.07]What do you do about the flying bugs?
[173:43.47]I haven't found anything to stop them.
[173:54.57]Okay, staff only.
[173:57.02]Use the handgun.
[174:01.35]Well, shit.
[174:02.35]I don't have one of those.
[174:13.67]All locked.
[174:16.20]Okay, so...
[174:20.40]This is the door that needs the lever.
[174:23.65]I've been in every single one of these I haven't been in this one.
[174:27.51]It's probably in this room.
[174:32.17]No, it's right here.
[174:34.63]Alright, I'm ready.
[174:45.57]Carry on my wayward son?
[174:48.14]Or... what?
[174:50.43]Or what daughter?
[174:52.90]You're not very good at this, dude.
[175:01.97]Let's go.
[175:08.99]No.
[175:13.29]Alright, if you dare.
[175:14.34]I definitely dare.
[175:21.69]Thanks to the glove.
[175:25.34]Alright, everything loaded up?
[175:33.32]Oh no!
[175:36.88]That is kind of a shitload of them.
[175:39.86]Is there a boss?
[175:40.61]I don't see a health bar.
[175:47.77]It's this song again.
[175:58.72]I don't think I have to kill them.
[176:10.33]It's kind of like the Halloween decorations I had in my room.
[176:22.28]I guess I'll just leave.
[176:30.24]Yeah!
[176:32.15]I finally have a handgun!
[176:33.77]Nice.
[176:44.86]Okay, so this is the right way.
[176:46.07]I could use a save point.
[176:53.58]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[177:07.21]That not...
[177:12.06]I can't believe that guy just did that.
[177:18.93]Those aren't even handgun bullets.
[177:25.73]Oh my fuck!
[177:37.62]There we go.
[177:38.31]It's blue bullets.
[177:43.65]Ding.
[177:43.99]Fries are done.
[177:45.89]Hope they're good.
[178:00.25]Thank you.
[178:18.55]Alright, where am I in the game?
[178:20.77]Down here, alright.
[178:23.42]Chapter 10, The Torn Photograph.
[178:25.47]We're getting there.
[178:31.74]Look at how huge this chapter is.
[178:44.70]Peter's son or Lois' daughter?
[178:47.49]Are we talking about a fan?
[178:48.61]So you think you're a son and you think Peter Griffin's hilarious.
[178:53.51]Or you're a daughter and you think that Lois is hilarious or awesome.
[178:57.66]Or are you talking about like they are that?
[179:00.39]What's the context here?
[179:02.20]They are them.
[179:13.34]Um, that's Lois Griffin's daughter, 100%.
[179:17.46]Peter Griffin's son would be such a pain in the ass.
[179:20.77]It would be a lot.
[179:21.70]It would be a lot to handle.
[179:34.92]What button is flashlight?
[179:38.99]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero.
[179:43.85]What is the flashlight button?
[179:46.14]F?
[179:46.74]Okay, it's F.
[179:58.77]Thank you.
[180:18.49]Option one, son, or option two, daughter?
[180:21.33]I don't know.
[180:25.77]It's tough.
[180:32.95].
[180:33.82].
[180:37.40].
[180:44.23]Shut up.
[180:52.04]son or daughter?
[180:55.48]Dude, I don't, I mean, that first one I think would be hard to handle.
[181:06.64]Oh, no!
[181:19.16]Alright, this is the last one I'm doing.
[181:20.27]Courage the Cowardly Dog's Son or Snoopy Daughter?
[181:22.28]Snoopy.
[181:24.84]I love Snoopy.
[181:27.28]Shit
[181:42.78]God damn it.
[181:44.27]I don't want to die in this room.
[181:48.03]I'm gonna die in this room.
[181:52.79]Where am I?
[181:54.48]Okay, I need health.
[181:57.42]Big time.
[182:02.56]Yeah.
[182:18.14]Fucking die!
[182:19.12]No!
[182:24.71]Where's this other one?
[182:33.17]Oh my...
[182:48.65]health,
[183:01.35]Don't kill me!
[183:02.34]Don't do it!
[183:05.39]I hear him walking.
[183:17.17]I guess I have to go this way.
[183:32.18]Shit.
[183:35.66]There's a save point right here too.
[183:37.50]Please tell me this opens into it.
[183:41.17]Nice.
[183:42.68]Oh my god.
[183:43.45]I don't know.
[183:43.97]I don't know.
[183:44.36]I don't know.
[183:44.74]I don't know.
[183:45.18]I don't know.
[183:45.47]Don't softlock me with the save, please.
[183:59.02]There we go.
[184:00.60]Right when you need it.
[184:05.92]This hospital layout sucks.
[184:07.62]I mean, if it wasn't just every room with barricades and blood and beds everywhere, then it would probably be fine.
[184:16.68]I'm gonna go in the big room.
[184:25.91]Oh, never mind.
[184:26.62]It's locked.
[184:34.13]I had the CRT filter on for so long I forgot it.
[184:36.87]Should I put it back on?
[184:42.77]My fucking god, I didn't think it was gonna get up that quick!
[184:46.57]Jeez.
[184:57.64]Aw jeez.
[184:58.81]I know, I did do an aw jeez.
[185:28.82]He doesn't have the handgun.
[185:31.23]Ha ha ha ha.
[185:36.89]Hey dude, the Patriots are good again?
[185:42.93]I don't really pay attention to football, I'll be honest with you.
[185:47.69]I don't pay attention to any sport.
[186:04.67]That was a lot of bullets for two people.
[186:16.16]What's something that I think is cute?
[186:19.11]A little baby bunny.
[186:34.32]Hey!
[186:37.17]Where is it?
[186:51.55]Wait, that's another...
[186:57.60]I have all the photographs!
[187:00.59]I have the whole thing!
[187:03.12]I have it.
[187:04.09]Can you believe it?
[187:04.70]I have the whole thing.
[187:05.24]I've got the entire photograph, I think.
[187:10.14]That's 10-31-07.
[187:11.46]I think I've got the whole thing.
[187:23.00]you
[187:33.73]Now what do I do?
[187:47.69]Guard tower.
[187:49.89]This is where it's going to get crazy.
[187:53.21]Is it weird that I only want to get to chapter 16 to get to the final cutscene, the final boss, to hear what other horror cat song it's going to be?
[188:01.82]That's what's driving me to continue.
[188:16.66]Alright, so I got the whole photograph, which...
[188:20.54]If I go up, that's 10-31-07.
[188:30.94]I don't think I need to connect the dots.
[188:33.14]I think I can just punch it in, right?
[188:48.81]Dude, it was the game's release date.
[188:52.99]10-31-07.
[188:53.81]It's when it came out originally for the DS.
[188:58.63]Sniper?
[189:03.06]How am I supposed to snipe when you can't see 10 feet in front of you?
[189:13.90]Oh, that's worse than I that I'd rather shoot in the dark.
[189:28.72]Wait, what?
[189:31.45]Hi, Dev here.
[189:32.15]The game is running at 1.5x speed and it's harder due to VSync being on.
[189:35.85]Please turn it off.
[189:37.56]What?!
[189:38.27]!
[189:53.56]How do I...
[189:54.66]There is no VSync.
[190:01.33]How do I turn off VSync on here?
[190:09.71]Is it was fake?
[190:24.20]Fake Dev, his tone was unprofessional.
[190:31.93]Look at his tone.
[190:32.89]He had an unprofessional tone.
[190:38.41]So, okay, how do you expect a dev to say something in the chat?
[190:40.74]Like, hello, strangers!
[190:42.79]Like, hello!
[190:43.75]A poof of smoke appears in front of you and I appear, the dev.
[190:47.71]Just want to say thanks everybody for hanging out.
[190:49.88]How do you start that?
[190:52.45]Like a wow GM?
[190:54.08]How are you supposed to introduce yourself as a dev?
[191:09.97]Thank you.
[191:17.14]I laugh about it once every year or two.
[191:20.87]But.
[191:22.76]I told you guys about my brother getting banned from the game, right?
[191:26.21]Because of the bear-ass fart thing.
[191:28.04]Did I say that yet?
[191:30.91]I've said that, right?
[191:33.97]Yeah, I have.
[191:40.41]Okay.
[191:41.72]This is not an encouragement to do this, by the way.
[191:48.82]But me and my brother used to play WoW all the time.
[191:51.01]We were huge WoW fans.
[191:53.72]And
[191:53.84]I know.
[191:54.27]I sold the story.
[191:55.53]The story's been told like three times.
[191:57.04]Whatever.
[191:57.38]Every two or three years, it's like a thousand new people.
[192:02.23]My brother and I played a lot.
[192:04.54]and uh we were always we were playing like arenas together we were always playing this is back when it was this is like tbc this is pre this is like classic into tbc
[192:14.53]And he got up one day and we were going to play and he couldn't log into his account.
[192:19.16]He was literally, his account didn't work.
[192:21.74]He's like, what's going on?
[192:22.44]This is weird.
[192:23.51]I don't remember what the exact phrase is when you get kind of banned for a week.
[192:28.30]but he couldn't log in and he went to his email.
[192:31.59]And the email said,
[192:34.12]Hey, uh, hey, greetings!
[192:35.81]In a puff of smoke, it's me, a GM!
[192:38.16]No, the gre- it was like, hey,
[192:39.93]your account has been terminated for 72 hours for profanity or for whatever it was.
[192:46.59]It was for inappropriate behavior.
[192:48.86]And we were like, what the fuck?
[192:49.90]And they have to write what you said.
[192:52.79]And at some point, over the course of that day, I don't... First of all, imagine somebody reporting this too, which is funny to me as well.
[192:59.91]Throughout the course of the day, he wrote in trade chat
[193:03.23]He wrote it like this, in brackets.
[193:05.97]You know how it's like, oh, wants to buy, or wants to sell, then you would shift-click the item in your inventory,
[193:11.57]and it would paste in text, in a bracket, the item that you were selling.
[193:16.52]So he wrote this.
[193:19.27]He wrote WTB, like, wants to buy, and then pretended, like, oh, I shift-clicked this.
[193:28.28]And this is what got him banned for three days.
[193:40.16]And it's funny because like...
[193:51.65]We actually still, to this day, will be like, hey, remember when you got banned for saying, like, wants to buy bare-ass tomorrow?
[193:59.54]And he'll start laughing, and we'll start laughing.
[194:10.43]If I'm working on the WoW team of taking in those, you see some pretty horrible shit, right?
[194:17.38]You see some pretty heinous shit that comes through.
[194:19.69]I feel like that one coming through, even if I had to do it, I'd laugh at it.
[194:23.11]I'd be like, alright, man, I liked it.
[194:24.71]That was a good one.
[194:25.94]But we'll see you in three days.
[194:31.05]That's a legendary chat message.
[194:34.82]Yeah, right, but it doesn't matter.
[194:39.78]Yeah, I typed that in the chat.
[194:41.59]Look, I have that.
[194:42.32]Yeah, I said it out loud like three times.
[194:49.66]Just imagine you're reporting it though.
[194:52.64]Like you, ah, excuse me.
[194:55.09]Excuse, that's not, that's not a stone of Jordan.
[194:58.54]That's not a fucking enchant.
[195:00.75]That's not a shoulder enchant.
[195:03.56]And that's disgusting, by the way.
[195:05.17]I'm reporting this guy.
[195:10.89]Ugh.
[195:17.50]Alright, I got the snipe.
[195:18.28]Should I snipe from here?
[195:21.49]What am I trying to do here?
[195:36.90]Was it just to get the rifle?
[195:38.85]And that's it?
[195:42.43]Because this doesn't open.
[195:43.81]Maybe it's just for the sniper.
[195:46.35]Okay.
[195:46.77]Well, cool.
[195:47.22]I got a cool weapon.
[195:49.58]Well, now where do I go?
[195:53.69]I am not the programmer, so I didn't put it there, but the VSync setting is in the main menu.
[195:59.03]Go back to the main menu and turn it off.
[196:06.55]Wait, this person actually is a dev.
[196:12.05]They just told me like the next place to go to.
[196:15.10]Hold on, go to the west elevator?
[196:16.73]Hold on, wait, I need to save the game, because we need to see if this guy's a real dev.
[196:29.56]Because if I've been playing the game at 1.5x speed the whole time, that's actually... That's pretty funny.
[196:34.74]Is it music times 2x speed too?
[196:43.15]Wait a minute.
[196:44.10]Hold on.
[197:10.05]wants to buy.
[197:18.91]Dude, the follow-up joke that me and my brother always do with that is, like, imagine somebody just instantly, ding, just pinged my brother and was like, full gold.
[197:29.37]It's like, what does that mean?
[197:30.16]Are we, are you, are you selling this?
[197:33.00]What does that mean?
[197:36.63]Okay, I need a save point.
[197:38.41]Go to the west elevator.
[197:43.48]Wait, aren't I already in, like, the west...
[197:46.33]I unlocked it with a keycard?
[197:47.76]When did I get a magic keycard?
[197:49.33]The same one I've had the whole game?
[198:11.03]Alright, let's save it right here.
[198:13.28]Save the game.
[198:14.14]Let's see if this is for real.
[198:24.25]you
[198:45.44]We need to restart the game?
[198:46.67]Oh.
[198:54.69]Hold on.
[199:02.69]Wait a minute.
[199:04.97]Mostly it's movement and enemy AI speed that's impacted.
[199:08.36]The cleaver and wheelchair gunner chopped and shot you up way too fast.
[199:14.15]The elevator you came down in back when you first entered the courtyard is progression.
[199:20.17]Wait, is this real?
[199:22.20]Have I been playing this game for like three fucking hours at times two speed?
[199:37.20]Thank you.
[199:58.51]Is it still there?
[199:59.48]It was off.
[200:11.02]Maybe it's just the... maybe the enemy AI?
[200:13.39]Yeah, how fast do enemies move now?
[200:15.82]Alright.
[200:16.56]So I have to go back to the elevator I was in before.
[200:22.09]The elevator when I first entered the courtyard.
[200:29.77]Where was that?
[200:33.81]We need an enemy to show up.
[200:40.75]Elevator's right there.
[200:41.64]Should I just go back in the elevator?
[200:43.32]Like that elevator?
[201:09.62]Okay.
[201:14.44]Is it a placebo effect or is the game smoother?
[201:16.57]I don't know.
[201:26.90]Not this elevator, the elevator next to the trees.
[201:31.44]Wait, there's a flashing panel.
[202:04.57]Okay.
[202:06.28]So this is the courtyard.
[202:08.53]So the other elevator, not this one, the one that's like down here.
[202:26.44]This one?
[202:41.05]We got to see an enemy move now.
[202:53.37]Dev son or stream sniper daughter?
[202:56.02]Dev son.
[203:03.98]Wait, was chapter 11 just... What did the dev do?
[203:08.49]What did the dev do?
[203:09.02]The dev made me do something weird.
[203:13.96]Why is this guy back?
[203:41.26]He's still alive!
[203:50.59]What is he doing?
[203:52.30]Does he have a health bar?
[204:40.54]I got him.
[204:49.37]Yeah, was Chapter 12 just getting the sniper?
[204:51.52]I mean, Chapter 11 was getting the sniper rifle.
[204:55.46]I mean, that is a worthy chapter.
[205:00.12]Okay, so now... What the hell do I do now?
[205:07.06]Where am I going now?
[205:24.67]I got full health.
[205:25.37]I'm good.
[205:35.50]Alright, so I have not been...
[205:37.67]I guess it's just new, right?
[205:39.98]This is all unexplored.
[205:42.67]I'm gonna go down lower right.
[205:44.35]Alright, wait, there's bugs?
[205:51.18]Are those moving faster or slower?
[205:52.95]I can't tell.
[205:58.09]I think that is moving slower.
[206:01.34]Is it?
[206:03.52]Is it moving two times slower?
[206:16.56]Is it... is it though?
[206:18.01]I don't...
[206:18.57]I don't think it is.
[206:19.55]You got one guy vsync syndrome.
[206:31.65]Shoot, shoot!
[206:45.67]AHHHHH!
[206:57.06]Shit dude Well now I need health bad
[207:09.35]Alright, this is a sniper level.
[207:28.77]Where is it?
[207:30.69]Where is it?
[207:32.26]Where even is it?
[207:55.90]Alright.
[207:56.39]Well, whatever.
[207:56.96]That was a total disaster anyways.
[207:58.46]Who cares?
[208:16.19]Roar!
[208:17.99]Roar!
[208:35.48]I don't like those things.
[208:36.52]They're actually scary.
[208:42.18]Oh, Monk Giga Robert Downey Jr. Coming after you.
[208:55.54]Okay.
[208:57.23]I'm ready to snipe.
[209:09.82]I can't sit here.
[209:12.77]Yes.
[209:13.76]Good.
[209:24.31]That was way too many shots to kill that.
[209:47.87]Okay, I can go...
[209:48.65]There's probably items in here.
[209:53.66]This room is quiet.
[209:54.74]You know what that means.
[209:57.40]Something horrible.
[210:10.47]It's kind of relaxing actually.
[210:20.14]Okay.
[210:23.76]Would this freak you out if you were a kid?
[210:25.27]It freaks me out as an adult.
[210:36.71]Alright.
[210:38.46]Staircase here.
[210:40.99]But let's not do it yet, because I need health.
[210:48.45]Those things do so much damage.
[210:54.05]That's crazy.
[210:59.91]The saw should have lifesteal.
[211:04.81]Am I loaded with everything?
[211:16.80]I got a lot of bullets for this thing.
[211:25.00]He wants to finish a DS game rather than play his favorite game ever.
[211:32.01]We will determine if that's true or not when I do the tier list of everything.
[211:41.44]where I put a tier list of every single thing I've ever liked.
[211:46.47]Everything I've ever truly loved, everything I've ever truly enjoyed.
[211:50.22]So just wait till we get front when, when, um, Elden Ring Shadow the Ur-Tree goes up against Honey Mustard.
[211:57.81]It's a tough one.
[211:58.43]It's gonna be fucking hard.
[212:02.21]And when cutting the lawn correctly for the first time in front of Dad, has to go up against
[212:07.21]You know, taking a sip out of a Coca-Cola for the first time in your whole life.
[212:13.29]This is going to be a difficult list.
[212:19.00]Thank you.
[212:30.02]They are moving slower, aren't they?
[212:42.51]I...
[212:55.82]What about your first million versus just barely getting to the bathroom on time?
[213:04.73]You mean that one time that I was going to the airport?
[213:08.75]and I had diarrhea really bad and I knew it was gonna be like a six hour plane.
[213:15.06]and I actually got a full diarrhea before getting on the plane, like at the house.
[213:21.91]And it was empty.
[213:22.94]And I was like, man, can you imagine if I was on the plane?
[213:26.50]That going up, that feeling of relief and that feeling of how wonderful that was going up against like my first backstab in Team Fortress 2.
[213:37.22]Yeah, that's tricky.
[213:43.13]What the fuck, dude?
[213:44.59]This is a hard segment.
[213:51.19]I think I have to run through this.
[214:03.51]Thank you.
[214:09.20]There's no items that are worth picking up anyways, just run.
[214:12.52]I'll take the... 20...
[214:14.01]I'll take the 60%.
[214:24.28]That's fine.
[214:34.05]That strategy's not gonna work.
[214:38.57]Shit.
[214:54.22]Get out of here!
[214:55.19]I can't believe I got hit by a slug.
[215:15.38]Is it alive?
[215:31.72]What are you doing?
[215:32.58]Oh!
[215:41.06]Alright, that's done.
[215:43.01]I have pretty much full health.
[215:45.76]Hey, what perks you running?
[215:47.26]I got, um... Let's see...
[215:51.29]Hard as Iron, which is 10% less physical damage.
[215:55.91]Notepad, which is 15% more wisdom.
[215:58.72]And then I have Killstreak X, which is every time you get 10 kills without dying before a save point, you get 50% more ammo on your next pickup, so...
[216:08.10]I like to have a little bit more ammo.
[216:17.94]People actually leave the notepad in the beginning of the game.
[216:20.79]But the wisdom buff is so important later.
[216:47.21]Excuse me?
[216:56.31]You were alive for way too long.
[217:04.22]Where?
[217:04.76]Where?
[217:08.00]Oh, she's looking at the wall.
[217:17.93]Those things are horrible.
[217:20.42]They're a souped-up version of the other one.
[217:23.58]They do 20% per damage.
[217:28.39]Why do I still hear one?
[217:42.31]I don't have very many bullets left.
[217:53.14]This might work out.
[217:55.78]I don't think I have enough shots in this to kill.
[218:01.75]Alright, we need to go right.
[218:05.94]What should I do?
[218:11.61]I see.
[218:24.52]at six.
[218:38.52]What the fuck?
[218:41.26]Why was it unloaded?
[218:47.75]Why would it not be loaded?
[218:49.42]I even checked it, didn't I?
[218:51.40]Am I stupid?
[218:59.94]There's nothing even in here.
[219:00.89]Oh yeah, there is.
[219:14.77]Thank you.
[219:29.57]Mmm...
[219:33.89]This is exactly where I died last time.
[219:37.10]They- they caught me with the same bullshit.
[219:48.16]They hit me with the same shit and I fell for the same routine.
[219:57.31]I cried at the same episode of the same TV show again.
[220:03.29]Oh no, hold on.
[220:04.66]Oh my God.
[220:40.04]This is way scarier on DS because the controls are terrible.
[220:44.38]You said suck.
[220:45.22]I've changed it.
[220:46.42]I went through the filter.
[220:52.61]Okay.
[221:02.41]Come on, nothing.
[221:07.66]I could do maybe the stairwell or no, there's a safe point up there.
[221:30.88]I don't hear any screaming ladies, right?
[221:33.76]Oh, thank goodness.
[221:35.20]Alright, don't lose this health before the save point.
[221:38.32]Imagine playing this on Demented.
[221:52.30]Stylus aiming is unironically better than mouse aiming.
[221:56.51]You have to aim with a stylus?
[221:57.90]That's how it worked?
[221:59.76]That sounds awful.
[222:08.51]How did you shoot?
[222:09.44]Did you have to hit like A or something while you held the stylus down?
[222:21.63]Alright, that was unironically scary.
[222:50.97]POV was on the touchscreen, that would be so easy.
[223:00.69]Ah, yes.
[223:01.78]Alright, here we go.
[223:04.66]Chapter 13.
[223:13.63]Load up the weapons, please.
[223:24.89]Okay.
[223:39.67]Oh my god!
[223:52.60]That face in chat is crazy.
[223:57.00]Um... Distrait?
[224:03.26]Oh, yes, give me.
[224:06.15]That's so many bullets.
[224:09.23]So many.
[224:16.65]Should I go keep going this way?
[224:20.55]What is that in chat?
[224:21.57]What the hell was that?
[224:23.58]What was that?
[224:29.07]Locked.
[224:34.85]Hey, was it ASCII art?
[224:37.94]What the hell?
[224:47.59]What are all these SpongeBob's?
[224:55.20]Aaaah!
[225:00.86]Dude, that was fucking so hard!
[225:27.00]Just kill me!
[225:30.57]I'm just taking out the saw.
[225:36.21]Give me the saw.
[225:38.14]Saw is gonna be the best thing to do here.
[225:40.53]Just gonna stand in the corner.
[225:43.51]Wait, what?
[226:01.34]That's way better, it just hurts to listen to.
[226:03.21]Alright, I'm good.
[226:09.42]There's not gonna be any more time for withering rooms.
[226:11.71]It's okay.
[226:12.41]It's one of my favorite games.
[226:15.80]Right next to my first bite of mac and cheese.
[226:35.05]This is gonna be crazy.
[226:46.65]I knew it.
[226:52.07]Okay.
[226:56.17]I think this is chapter 14.
[226:57.35]We're almost done.
[227:06.27]Wait, that was chapter 13.
[227:07.90]No, this is chapter 13 coming up.
[227:13.44]Gotta get up there.
[227:26.64]Why fight any of this?
[227:28.24]Why?
[227:28.46]They don't give experience or anything.
[227:35.64]11-6-25-10.
[227:36.88]Get a mental screenshot of that please.
[227:38.99]11-6-25-10.
[227:49.66]I need the door handle.
[227:50.60]Alright, so now we're gonna go...
[227:59.45]I could go over here.
[228:00.33]Oh, no, I can't.
[228:01.94]Alright.
[228:02.19]Well, this is the exit to chapter 14.
[228:07.88]So I'm going to go this way, straight and then right.
[228:24.61]Kinda need ammo.
[228:28.60]What is that?
[228:34.56]Could be random, that might be true.
[228:36.93]But I don't think so.
[228:37.76]It brought me to you.
[228:38.82]Hidden in the code, it's easy to see.
[228:41.17]Just remember that 10 equals E.
[228:51.08]What?
[228:54.57]Alphabet puzzle box.
[228:55.69]The lid is locked.
[228:56.60]Entering a special word will open it.
[229:05.12]Alright, E is 10.
[229:10.29]Oh, 11, 6, 25, 10!
[229:15.42]11, that's A B C D E F G H I J K?
[229:25.86]Uh, 21.
[229:27.43]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U.
[229:32.96]Okay.
[229:35.48]um it's 11 oh 11 6 wait what are you people saying the wrong shit
[229:45.19]So this is E. 11, 6, 25, 10.
[229:53.24]A, B, C, D, E, F.
[229:57.03]26, you said?
[229:58.00]A, B, C...
[230:00.73]I mean, I know it's...
[230:01.83]I know what it is.
[230:05.12]Does that work?
[230:12.25]11.
[230:20.10]Wait, it was 11, right?
[230:21.65]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. E is not the tenth number.
[230:32.23]What was on the door?
[230:32.92]11, 6, 25, 10.
[230:37.57]Yeah.
[230:41.35]E isn't the 10th letter, why not?
[230:44.22]Wait, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
[230:48.20]It would be J.
[230:49.77]But wait, what is it saying in here?
[230:51.55]It says that's not correct.
[230:52.98]Use your mind.
[230:54.01]What does it say?
[230:54.51]10 equals E. Wait.
[231:02.41]So that if it's not 1 to 1, then... Is that the baseline?
[231:09.98]If 10 equals E, does that mean...
[231:14.15]F is 11.
[231:16.78]Okay, so... A, B, C, D, E...
[231:20.44]So six.
[231:22.29]So B... E...
[231:25.09]A, B, C, D, E. You can't go backwards that much though, can you?
[231:28.88]6 would be 6... 7, 8, 9, 10.
[231:31.80]So E...
[231:34.37]A, B, B, C, D, E, so it would be B, right?
[231:39.44]E is the fifth letter, so multiply by two.
[231:43.60]Six is A.
[231:44.65]Well, six is, yes, six is A.
[231:47.28]So it'd be A.
[231:52.03]Let me write that.
[231:53.52]Let me write stuff.
[231:55.32]11, 6, 26, 10.
[231:57.65]Not having to go by the chat so fast.
[232:00.96]and then 10 is e so if 10 is e then that means 11 would be f
[232:15.47]Which means this would be... Well, no, we JK, right?
[232:21.50]Okay, we K. Because that would be 10.
[232:23.61]No, no, 26, okay.
[232:26.11]So then this one would be, I think this one's C. No, this one's C.
[232:31.22]And then that'd be six, it'd be E minus 10.
[232:33.39]So one, two, three, well, you have to go backwards from Z.
[232:35.96]So it'd be U, I think, right?
[232:40.77]Alright, what was it?
[232:48.11]Hey, five years ago you said you'd play Chibi-Robo.
[232:50.36]I've played the whole game.
[232:51.72]I played Chibi-Robo the entire thing.
[232:53.71]I've streamed the whole thing.
[232:57.64]Okay, 11 is, I need to like not look at chat and not think about anything with this because I can, it's very easy.
[233:04.68]10 is E, that means 11 is F, so this one's first one's F.
[233:09.29]If 10 is E, 10, nine, eight, seven, six.
[233:12.68]So four letters before E would be E,
[233:20.05]A, B, C, D. So it would be B, right?
[233:23.60]B, A, B, C, D, E, right?
[233:29.50]six would be b right would it be a no a
[233:38.72]A6?
[233:40.02]Is it on the 6?
[233:40.93]Like 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[233:42.71]So it would be A.
[233:45.33]Okay.
[233:46.85]And then 10 is E.
[233:52.91]Got it.
[234:08.52]Someone passed out listening?
[234:10.31]Alright.
[234:14.12]Let me, like, explore.
[234:14.93]I want to get some items.
[234:16.59]I need ammo and shit.
[234:17.64]Hold on.
[234:23.47]What do I have for bullets?
[234:31.08]I got plenty of that.
[234:34.74]I actually think I'm alright.
[234:36.54]I have tons of shotgun bullets.
[234:37.66]Yeah, I'm fine.
[234:39.58]Let's go.
[234:42.81]Hmm.
[234:50.34]I just rolled two mega joints.
[234:51.97]I'm going to start communing and consulting and shit, etc.
[234:58.44]I love how you put etc.
[235:00.06]at the end of that.
[235:03.11]You know, I'm going to be commuting and consult etc.
[235:05.04]You know how it is.
[235:05.76]You know, the works.
[235:08.41]Okay.
[235:10.17]Alright, back to this room.
[235:16.64]Bingo.
[235:28.95]I didn't save the game.
[235:29.75]Good evening.
[235:30.51]I'm Karina Phillips reporting from Redmore News.
[235:33.15]Our top story tonight, a 30-year-old woman was found shot dead in her home last night.
[235:38.14]Police were called to the scene after neighbors reported hearing gunshots from the home.
[235:42.36]Officers arrived at the scene to find an armed gunman standing over the victim's body.
[235:47.24]The confrontation resulted in the police firing gunshots, injuring the suspect.
[235:51.93]Officers found the victim's eight-year-old daughter unharmed in the home.
[235:55.46]They believe she may have witnessed the killing, but police are still investigating the scene.
[236:00.35]After the break.
[236:07.65]What the fuck?
[236:17.51]Wait, there was a safe point over here.
[236:28.14]The creep factor just went up 10, 20, 30%.
[236:33.70]Do you have a creep factor meter right now?
[236:35.54]A creep factor.
[236:36.84]I need one right now.
[236:41.38]I need a creep factor meter.
[236:43.69]kind of like a big, like a half moon, kind of a half circle, where there's a low, medium, and high, and it's kind of red.
[236:52.34]uh, green and orange, you know what I'm saying?
[236:54.61]Like the creep factor meter.
[236:58.21]And I need to be able to put it on stream here in the lower right corner to let you know just how I feel.
[237:25.96]Okay.
[237:27.38]Let's go.
[237:36.96]Where?
[237:37.57]Ah!
[237:45.11]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[237:51.10]That creep factor is at least a medium.
[238:16.28]So much unnecessary damage.
[238:30.34]There has to be one more setting at Demented.
[238:47.89]It's too many enemies.
[239:03.17]Health pack.
[239:04.95]Yep.
[239:07.50]Excellent.
[239:13.16]Locked?
[239:16.17]Did it go all the way around?
[239:20.21]Bro, weren't you a CS:GO champion?
[239:21.93]What happened?
[239:24.40]If this is a real comment, then you've got me so, so painfully confused with somebody else.
[239:29.70]But I'll run with it.
[239:32.23]Uh... Well, me and the boys split up after the first championship.
[239:37.75]And...
[239:38.97]I mean, everyone's doing alright though, but that first win was just...
[239:42.86]I mean, we won like four or five times, but that first win, that's going to have to go pretty high up next to like eating the first bite of mac and cheese, I think, is winning that first tournament.
[239:52.23]Second tournament was great, but the first one, man.
[239:56.27]I remember when I took my cap off and I threw it into the audience, everyone was like,
[239:59.72]trying to get the hat, like, oh my god, he threw a hat in the audience!
[240:04.08]Because that was my special lucky hat.
[240:07.15]Remember the hat that I used to wear?
[240:08.21]It was like, it was blue.
[240:10.81]He has like a cool blue hat.
[240:31.06]Those are the good days, yeah.
[240:38.57]Sometimes I'll open up Counter-Strike and just play it for a little bit.
[240:43.65]but trying to like relive the old days just doesn't really work out, man.
[240:51.93]These younger kids these days, man, I just get rolled.
[240:55.19]There's so much more like in tune with it somehow.
[240:58.37]I don't know.
[241:08.52]I think I went like, I got like four and eight or four and nine was the last time I played.
[241:13.22]Yeah, it was like four and nine.
[241:16.11]It was not bad.
[241:36.45]Oh, he's still alive.
[241:46.10]Okay.
[241:48.90]I need to go back around this way.
[241:55.67]Why is there an M16 in the game?
[241:57.50]And it sounds like a paintball gun.
[241:59.44]I...
[242:00.69]I don't know!
[242:08.07]Come on!
[242:09.84]Is it full?
[242:12.74]Oh, it's full.
[242:18.33]Uh-oh!
[242:20.37]Where?
[242:21.16]I...
[242:30.70]I'm sorry, I apologize.
[242:32.00]Turn the volume down if you need to.
[242:40.61]Those things can kill you in one second.
[242:56.00]Who are you?
[242:57.54]And what are you doing here?
[243:00.98]By the time I realized something was wrong, the entire city was infested with zombies.
[243:10.09]But you should be safe in here.
[243:23.13]I already went this way.
[243:24.44]Right that way.
[243:47.60]Dude, they're eating it.
[243:49.37]That's disgusting.
[243:50.57]It's a shocking amount of horror.
[244:18.06]Where the fuck are you?
[244:27.01]I hate that sound.
[244:29.32]Alright, this is to all future video game makers.
[244:33.34]I know I'm talking to you 20-something potential years in the past.
[244:37.01]But let me haunt you for a second.
[244:38.60]Please, don't ever put high-pitched spinning sounds in a video game.
[244:46.33]we as haunted game players,
[244:50.33]We want low-grading grinding sounds, not high-pitched dentist sounds for saw blades.
[244:57.81]Don't do it!
[245:05.77]Oh my god, this is a terrible room.
[245:08.94]The creep meter's going up.
[245:12.15]I can tell.
[245:17.46]Fuck you, I'm gonna make every high-pitched noise to spite you.
[245:24.16]What if I just don't play you?
[245:29.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes!
[245:40.95]Thank you.
[245:48.95]Hey, if you're having trouble with enemies, turn VSync off.
[245:50.82]I worked on this port, and the director was gonna lay me off, so I made VSync speed- Okay, I don't- God, come on, man.
[246:00.98]I thought you were another dev.
[246:04.14]But I think you're a fake dev.
[246:07.77]you
[246:16.10]Is that it?
[246:16.97]Wait, that's locked.
[246:21.71]I think this is the way.
[246:22.50]I want to get in there though.
[246:26.31]I don't think I can.
[246:27.99]It's definitely locked.
[246:29.60]But what's in here?
[246:37.47]Chapter 15?
[246:38.03]It doesn't work that way, there's no D.
[246:44.84]Chapter 14.
[246:46.49]Did it say the wheelchair returns?
[246:53.51]The wheelchair returns.
[246:55.97]That's a lot of ammo.
[247:04.55]It's funny that it's the name of the chapter, too.
[247:07.50]Chapter 14.
[247:10.39]We've recycled this boss.
[247:12.72]That's what they titled the game's chapter.
[247:17.75]Is it the same hallway?
[247:28.68]It really is.
[247:29.44]Alright, can I snipe him?
[247:39.55]Don't die.
[247:40.29]Don't snipe either.
[247:43.99]Just take the... Do what I did last time.
[247:52.07]Oh, fuck off.
[247:53.95]He's red so that means he's harder.
[248:10.80]Brr, brr, brr.
[248:54.04]I can't- you can't see shit!
[248:55.62]Is this penis music?
[249:22.00]Garvis.
[249:29.00]Is he down there?
[249:29.81]Oh, he is down there.
[249:31.65]Alright, here we go.
[249:53.44]He's loading.
[250:11.59]Fuck, I'm gonna die, dude.
[250:13.48]What the hell?
[250:16.93]Why is he still in the same spot?
[250:18.48]Alright, stop doing the... Why is he...
[250:45.53]He's in the corner here, but you have to make him turn.
[250:47.64]Okay, so now I get him.
[251:09.32]Oh, I'm so glad it didn't pop around that corner.
[251:16.17]He's still in the same spot!
[251:22.53]Don't die.
[251:23.51]Alright, I promise I'm not overreacting on purpose.
[251:32.93]Where is he?
[251:37.35]Oh my god, where is he?
[251:39.12]There he is, at the end.
[251:40.87]If I had a grenade, I would just throw it around the corner.
[251:49.08]Oh my God.
[251:53.16]Damn it, dude.
[252:53.46]He...
[253:05.93]Did that guy just throw a grenade at me?
[253:09.39]Okay, I probably tried to speedrun it.
[253:15.26]Hey, the creep factor, I made it.
[253:17.89]Did you actually?
[253:20.89]Somebody made the creep factor thing?
[253:25.13]let's see
[253:34.65]this is not what I was talking about
[253:41.01]This is, alright, I'm gonna use this, but this is...
[253:45.22]Hold on, I need to get this.
[253:49.74]Am I, what, am I smoking something?
[254:00.50]Hold on.
[254:04.50]This is not what I was expecting.
[254:07.33]But it is.
[254:07.91]It works for now.
[254:11.86]It's in black.
[254:13.13]This black text.
[254:14.49]This whole game is too dark for this one.
[254:21.16]Alright, hold on.
[254:21.78]Can you see it if I go like this?
[254:33.14]Oh, let me get the other one.
[254:34.33]There's a couple more, hold on.
[254:43.43]it's so funny I'll tell you and I'll put it exactly the one that I feel right now
[254:55.58]I gotta overlay it.
[254:57.03]Hold on.
[255:09.28]Are they the same size?
[255:10.54]Is one of them bigger than the other one?
[255:26.43]okay let me get the last one
[255:38.11]I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna take the super crazy one.
[255:50.75]Okay, get this here.
[255:55.47]What does this one say on it?
[256:00.01]Oh, it says demented factor.
[256:02.65]Oh, I see what you did there.
[256:13.29]Alright.
[256:14.40]So let's go.
[256:15.15]I think the creep meter is at a medium right now.
[256:23.84]Appreciate it.
[256:26.11]Uh, that was from bobble in the Discord.
[256:28.03]So appreciate that bubble.
[256:30.52]It is, it is very funny.
[256:32.10]It looks at, did you do this in paint?
[256:41.44]Okay, let's go.
[256:48.91]No, I'm actually...
[256:50.54]This is wrong.
[256:51.30]It's definitely this one right now.
[256:55.67]It'll drop down to a medium if I can actually beat this.
[257:09.43]Have I tried the new Taco Bell chicken strips?
[257:11.46]No, and I don't- and I never- I never ever will.
[257:14.94]Ever.
[257:16.91]How have I not hit him?
[257:45.53]Thanks for watching!
[257:55.50]He will if they pay him.
[258:51.60]Alright, GG.
[258:52.56]That's it.
[259:04.74]That is, we're going on to chapter 15.
[259:14.41]Wait, let me know if you actually want
[259:17.33]The strat for the final boss, he's actually pretty hard.
[259:21.00]None of the other people saying they're the devs are actual devs, but that chat's funny.
[259:30.17]We'll see when we get there.
[259:31.38]I feel like we're getting there soon.
[259:34.66]I'm gonna save it here.
[259:49.49]30% health, that's not a good place to say, but whatever, we're doing it.
[260:01.54]Okay, well that... That's a certified creep meter going down.
[260:06.15]We're at orange level right now.
[260:16.53]Alright, where am I?
[260:20.66]Alright, back here
[260:41.35]Oh boy, I'm so happy.
[260:42.81]I'm glad to see that.
[260:51.20]Ah!
[260:53.97]I thought I just loaded shotgun shells into the flashlight.
[261:04.32]Alright, I'm thinking it's a...
[261:10.68]I thought wrong.
[261:20.20]Ah!
[261:21.70]Run, run, run, run, run.
[261:22.87]Just run, just run, run, run.
[261:27.63]Just run, run.
[261:35.45]Horror.
[261:41.47]This is a horror game.
[261:46.49]What is up here?
[261:52.31]I think I know where they got that sound effect.
[261:54.58]I think that's a helicopter.
[262:08.07]worst enemy in the game.
[262:10.24]This three of them up there, isn't there?
[262:30.30]Nothing even in here.
[262:38.52]Hmm?
[262:43.53]Oh my god!
[263:00.25]Doing alright.
[263:23.54]There's a better spot for it.
[263:42.03]Fuck, trying to overlay that was going to be hard.
[263:47.05]That's good enough.
[263:55.70]Okay.
[263:57.77]Um...
[263:57.89]I think I'm gonna go over here.
[263:59.54]Wait.
[264:00.08]No, I'm not.
[264:00.60]What's over this way?
[264:04.33]Bunch of bullshit.
[264:18.73]Dude, always reload your gun.
[264:21.37]I have a thousand bullets.
[264:24.59]Reload everything.
[264:26.90]We're good, right?
[264:27.79]Everything's loaded.
[264:28.37]Good.
[264:28.79]Come on, man.
[264:32.95]Ooh, save point up there.
[264:33.90]Wait, there could be goodies.
[264:45.19]That would have been scary if I was looking.
[264:53.89]Bugs?
[264:58.00]Oh!
[265:00.09]Oh, come on, dude.
[265:03.65]Now I have to eat all this damage just to get...
[265:20.43]I think actually they're stuck on the wall.
[265:22.61]Perfect.
[265:23.18]Go.
[265:32.95]Alright, I wanna go left.
[265:36.02]And then left.
[265:42.72]Save point in here, right?
[265:46.05]It's a weird place for a save point.
[265:52.75]Alright.
[265:54.84]I think it's the room all the way to the end.
[265:56.63]Over here.
[266:00.05]And then that puts us in chapter 16 almost, right?
[266:04.06]Are we in 15 right now or 14?
[266:18.16]What the fuck are you doing here?
[266:24.75]What the heck?
[266:31.00]Big hallway.
[266:31.66]Should I try going out that door?
[266:34.49]Let me see.
[266:38.98]Okay, I can't.
[266:39.52]So I have to go all the way around.
[266:40.35]That's fine.
[266:42.80]Am I still gonna play Withering Rooms?
[266:46.84]Um...
[266:48.62]I think?
[266:50.11]There probably won't be enough time.
[266:53.51]I imagine there's probably like another 40 minutes to an hour of the game, which takes us right to about five to six hours on screen.
[267:00.04]stream total, which is exactly what I planned on streaming for, so probably not.
[267:05.22]All you withering rooms heads.
[267:08.60]I'm sorry.
[267:09.94]We'll do it another day.
[267:17.39]That had to have been lightning reaction time.
[267:33.47]Close your ears.
[267:43.75]A lot of chunks here.
[267:52.20]You should be jumping.
[267:53.39]There is no jump button.
[267:55.79]There's also no sprint button either.
[268:00.40]Here it is.
[268:01.65]Chapter 15.
[268:04.81]The final two chapters.
[268:09.42]Could you survive the demented encounters of Dementia of the Ward?
[268:18.41]When you see the final credits you'll know you made it to the end.
[268:23.15]You can tell your friends just how scary.
[268:28.01]the game was.
[268:32.79]You will be truly forever changed after playing The Demented Rooms.
[268:39.20]What happened is I mixed together the two games I was playing today.
[268:47.06]Truly demented.
[268:58.24]Ugh!
[269:09.05]What is the objective of the game?
[269:11.72]Um... Dude, I actually have no idea.
[269:16.80]I have no idea what my objective is.
[269:19.85]I'm just walking around and cutscenes are playing.
[269:22.40]I think that somebody got murdered.
[269:23.61]This lady got killed like four times on our screen.
[269:29.03]I'm just trying to find my way around.
[269:30.54]Sometimes it says a chapter is done and I'm like, alright, nice, let's go.
[269:34.67]You fight a guy in a wheelchair twice, then this big scary guy with a cleaver chases you around, and now we're at Chapter 15.
[269:44.03]and I've loved every second of it.
[269:56.86]You want the official review?
[269:58.38]Okay, the official review of this game is a...
[270:01.40]Uh...
[270:03.22]It loses one...
[270:04.25]It loses a letter grade for being too dark.
[270:08.44]You know what I mean?
[270:09.10]I shooting like this.
[270:09.69]I don't like that.
[270:10.60]That's full letter grade.
[270:21.01]uh besides that I like it I like how crazy it is I like the different it's kind of it's like a little maze you have to find the right layout it's fun
[270:30.17]Too dark.
[270:33.30]It's too loud.
[270:40.53]We'll see.
[270:41.06]I have to give my full assessment.
[271:00.78]I mean, I'm still here playing it, right?
[271:02.47]I'm enjoying it.
[271:03.77]Okay.
[271:09.55]How many are there?
[271:11.78]There's like a thousand of them.
[271:14.38]What is hap- Why are there so- You've been up my ass the whole time.
[271:23.93]Okay.
[271:26.89]Alright, looks like we're gonna go up right and then probably down to the save point.
[271:33.03]Something blinking over there.
[271:33.93]I don't know what it is, but...
[271:45.85]It's not good.
[271:47.64]Where do I want to go?
[271:48.36]Uh, yep.
[271:53.26]Oh my god!
[271:57.58]That was a horrible place to spawn one of those.
[272:08.75]That door doesn't open.
[272:09.68]Yeah, we're going to have to slowly kind of go through this.
[272:20.52]Little surprise rooms.
[272:23.07]Do you guys remember they used to make open surprise eggs on YouTube?
[272:27.57]Is that people still do that shit?
[272:34.37]To me, that was like the turn of the... Like, that's a point that I can pinpoint that's like, okay, I actually don't like anything anymore.
[272:42.78]Like, that's the pinpoint.
[272:44.36]for me.
[272:45.81]It's like, when that was happening, like, right the second that was happening, I was like, I hate everything now.
[272:49.75]It's like, then it's kind of stayed that way ever since.
[272:52.82]The hell?
[273:07.87]Did I get them both?
[273:09.86]Turn it on, dude.
[273:10.39]What are you doing?
[273:19.33]Thank you.
[273:24.67]What did the surprise eggs do to you?
[273:26.04]It was just at that moment that I did a big cartoon gulp and was like, I don't like this.
[273:35.36]Thank you.
[273:41.47]Oh, fuck.
[273:42.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[273:43.82]Actually freaking out right now.
[273:45.25]Actually having a freak out moment because I don't want to lose because the save point is so far away.
[273:51.24]Oh fuck, this is bad.
[273:56.13]Mr. Redmore, we meet at last.
[274:01.19]This guy?
[274:02.52]This is the last boss?
[274:10.20]I need to get through this.
[274:12.16]Save point's literally right here.
[274:21.66]Yeah.
[274:23.39]Every time I get so scared, they go, look at all this.
[274:28.41]No!
[274:28.85]I wanted to read that!
[274:30.20]What does it say?
[274:31.30]Somebody go pause my stream.
[274:33.35]Can somebody pause my stream?
[274:36.17]And go, like, to the VOD and get that?
[274:40.44]Wait, I can't read it.
[274:43.73]Anybody got it?
[274:49.64]Gotta play the sequel.
[274:53.03]Second game lets you dual-wield the flashlight with one-handed weapons.
[274:56.14]Ooh.
[274:59.61]I wanted to read that.
[275:00.76]I'm invested in the game's story, and I missed one item, and we know what it is.
[275:03.95]Who cares?
[275:06.71]It said,
[275:09.40]Oh, by the way...
[275:10.65]I don't wanna... That video's edited.
[275:16.47]And now that I think about it, how did I ever think that that video was real?
[275:20.46]It's sad to know.
[275:26.36]That's too bad.
[275:27.15]That would have been so funny.
[275:29.40]But it still is really funny.
[275:30.63]It still is one of my favorite videos.
[275:34.04]Okay, my sweet Amanda, I'm sorry I cannot be there for you.
[275:39.22]You must trust your daddy.
[275:41.70]He did not harm me.
[275:43.08]I was already gone when he found me.
[275:45.86]I will always love you, my dear mommy.
[275:52.03]This feels like a fake letter.
[275:58.90]What are you reading?
[275:59.62]I'm reading the letter that I just picked up off the ground 10 seconds ago.
[276:09.53]I feel like the murderer would leave this.
[276:13.11]Oh yeah, she wrote that.
[276:15.23]Says, I did nothing wrong and trust everything that I do.
[276:18.58]And I'm the good guy.
[276:20.21]She wrote this.
[276:32.39]Do I dare open this door?
[276:34.30]Oh, it's locked.
[276:35.00]Okay.
[276:37.07]They're feeding me so much ammo and... Uh-oh.
[276:42.67]Did you read the letter?
[276:43.49]I didn't do anything.
[276:50.88]Where's the save point?
[276:51.87]Oh.
[276:57.18]It's so weird.
[277:01.20]Dude, you left all this for me.
[277:02.83]That's so much to leave for somebody.
[277:04.92]It's like a fucking case of this.
[277:08.12]I can imagine two, right?
[277:09.69]Like, maybe one.
[277:11.30]But that's a lot.
[277:12.51]That is a lot of ammo to leave.
[277:17.90]That's a crazy amount.
[277:23.59]Is everything loaded up?
[277:26.98]Yeah, for the boss, I feel like the boss left all this.
[277:30.82]Or I'm invading somebody's little hideout or something.
[277:38.85]Everything fully loaded?
[277:43.88]Okay.
[277:45.97]I have full health, I got full everything.
[277:48.77]I just don't have a pistol and I hope it doesn't ruin the game.
[277:53.47]More shotgun ammo is upstairs?
[277:58.13]I will get it.
[278:02.70]Oh, that's handgun ammo.
[278:07.60]It's all good, I got enough.
[278:16.58]Alright, I'm ready.
[278:17.26]Let's go.
[278:19.26]Fuck this guy.
[278:25.84]We got a new song, and it is light.
[278:30.71]Dude, this is a- this is the final boss music?
[278:45.27]I'm gonna try to use as little bullets as I can here.
[279:05.90]Music's different.
[279:15.73]No, light!
[279:24.80]Wait, what the hell?
[279:25.79]Did I turn around?
[279:26.39]Did I turn around?
[279:44.67]Yep, okay, go.
[279:56.73]Wait, did I was I in them?
[279:59.00]Did I turn around?
[280:05.36]What?
[280:07.63]Oh, oh, okay.
[280:11.52]How did I go backwards?
[280:15.73]I was going to change it to demented, but it's already there.
[280:27.76]It looks like I killed everything in here, but I didn't.
[280:29.82]Wait, I think it's probably... Oh, it's doing it on a purpose.
[280:34.87]No it's not, I'm just an idiot.
[280:37.08]I thought I had to pick the right music.
[280:48.17]There's no items.
[280:52.89]Oh my god.
[281:09.77]Hey, genuine question, how did you get so confident with people in public speaking?
[281:12.62]I'm taking on a new job soon, it's going to be very demanding on people in work, extremely socially awkward.
[281:16.69]How do I talk in public?
[281:19.28]Um... Alright, well... You just have to confidently talk.
[281:23.74]Um, even if you're wrong.
[281:27.57]Somebody will correct you eventually.
[281:39.94]Hold on, I'll give you the real answer in a minute.
[281:59.60]Uh, alright, so when you talk in public or talk to somebody that you don't know that's a stranger, you have to trick your brain.
[282:05.37]Your brain has to sort of pretend that you already know them.
[282:09.34]You should talk to people confidently in a way where you almost like you've already know them and that they're, it's not like a big deal.
[282:17.47]You're just kind of talking to somebody you already know.
[282:20.71]A big crowd of people, that's obviously impossible because it's like, oh, there's a shitload of people here.
[282:25.73]How could I, I don't know anybody here or everybody here.
[282:29.03]You talk to the exit signs.
[282:31.15]Just pretend like the exit signs are your friends.
[282:39.98]Exit sign to the left, exit sign to the right, exit sign in the back.
[282:47.10]That just do your thing.
[282:49.27]That's demented.
[282:50.45]It works.
[282:52.96]Sometimes that's all that needs to happen.
[282:54.19]It just needs to work.
[282:58.09]And sometimes randomly, make sure to like pick out somebody and just kind of look them right in the eye.
[283:02.65]Just so people know that you're not just looking at the exit signs.
[283:07.67]I already said this.
[283:08.79]This is like 10 years ago I said this.
[283:16.92]Yeah, but there's a thing though.
[283:19.17]There's a line where
[283:21.49]Oh, okay, I'm just gonna talk to everybody like they're my friends.
[283:24.06]Oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[283:24.87]Hey, how are you?
[283:26.01]Oh, what's up?
[283:26.86]We can't wait to work on this thing together.
[283:28.83]That's... Take a step back.
[283:30.54]That's too much.
[283:31.89]Take the breaks a little.
[283:41.69]Just look at the same person every time you do that.
[283:43.98]That'd be so fucking weird.
[283:50.03]That would be too weird.
[283:51.33]I do not recommend that.
[284:05.57]Also, the be confident thing is not necessarily an untrue thing I was saying.
[284:09.45]You have to kind of be confident in what you're doing and saying.
[284:16.93]Try not to be unsure about every other word that comes out of your mouth because what you're going to do if you're not going to public speaking is you're going to say a word
[284:23.63]And then your brain is going to say, what's the next word?
[284:26.04]And then every single word after each word, you have to find what the next word is.
[284:34.36]The more you think about everything that you're saying, the harder it is for you to actually get it out.
[284:50.20]Oh my god, they're giving me so much... What button was it?
[284:52.87]I forgot!
[284:55.30]Oh my god, dude, I forgot what fucking button it was to get the stupid buzzsaw out.
[285:01.87]This is so- I gotta- I'm just gonna run through the whole thing.
[285:11.70]lock in to get through this dude.
[285:13.33]This part's horrible.
[285:14.26]Okay.
[285:35.23]Alright, I got the saw.
[285:46.26]That sound just hurt my teeth.
[285:47.77]Is that weird?
[285:49.50]My teeth hurt from that sound.
[285:58.33]How am I gonna actually take on three of those?
[286:14.07]It's gonna, I think it's gonna have to be, it's a machine gun.
[286:29.65]Left or right, I don't remember.
[286:40.35]It's very helpful.
[286:40.95]I tend to second guess myself when I talk and I start over everything that I say.
[286:43.90]It makes me sound like I'm completely illiterate.
[286:46.29]Don't know what I'm talking about.
[286:47.13]Like I'm supposed to be stood in front of these people that are asking me questions and I sound dumb.
[286:50.34]Okay, here's another thing.
[286:53.43]Here's another thing.
[286:56.36]I know that one of the things that pops into everybody's brain when they're talking to people or talking to people in public or in a setting that is like people are listening to you
[287:04.83]For the most part, those people want to hear what you have to say.
[287:07.60]They don't think you're stupid.
[287:09.59]They're there to listen to what you are saying.
[287:13.41]So when you guess yourself as to being stupid, everyone thinks I'm an idiot in here,
[287:17.27]a lot of times they actually, they think they're an idiot and they're like, hopefully this guy knows what he's talking about because I don't fucking know what I'm talking about.
[287:25.47]Usually in that case, it's you're the one that is the person to look to if you're supposed to be speaking publicly about something.
[287:34.69]You know that old saying that like, the spider is more afraid of you than you are of it?
[287:40.12]That's true for a lot of things.
[287:42.41]Like an unbelievable amount of things.
[287:54.34]So just look at the audience and imagine there's a bunch of spiders.
[288:27.28]What door is he in?
[288:30.30]God damn it!
[288:39.08]There's no way I'm going to have to do it again.
[288:40.57]I can't.
[288:41.36]I have to lock in so much.
[288:48.01]There's no health anywhere.
[288:49.10]Is that the point that there's no health anywhere?
[289:16.29]Oh.
[289:31.48]I played that Alien game at the arcade so many times, I'm prepared for it.
[289:42.55]One of you die!
[289:43.53]Oh!
[289:46.03]Oh!
[289:48.74]Okay, that's the worst room in the whole game.
[289:50.71]Um, you know what I'm talking about.
[289:51.97]The alien, we have to shoot them in the little target in their chest.
[289:54.90]And they go back, otherwise they steal the, um, energy crates.
[290:11.98]It was a physical game at the arcade.
[290:14.39]These little aliens, these physical aliens would kind of waddle up.
[290:17.91]There was, I think, six of them in a row and they were on a track.
[290:21.34]And they slowly came up, and if one of them got close enough to where you were, the gun was in front.
[290:26.59]He was shooting into like a little...
[290:29.84]It's kind of like built into the cabinet.
[290:33.43]They were physical aliens.
[290:34.40]Yeah.
[290:34.74]Alright.
[290:35.32]Oh my fuck.
[290:38.47]Don't lose to stupid... Is that bait?
[290:53.62]Is there a save point?
[291:00.49]So much ammo.
[291:03.26]No save point?
[291:04.73]Are you serious?
[291:09.99]This is gonna be miserable.
[291:11.12]I have to beat this boss in one go?!
[291:12.86]!
[291:24.91]I think everything's good.
[291:25.82]Alright.
[291:29.86]I'll lock it in.
[291:30.36]Let's go.
[291:34.90]a square room.
[291:36.93]It's gonna be awful.
[292:00.15]Don't do that!
[292:00.73]How do I stop him from doing this?
[292:06.70]Does he guarantee to do that damage to you?
[292:13.78]He does guaranteed damage.
[292:15.08]How do I stop that?
[292:23.50]How do I stop the guaranteed damage?
[292:32.24]I can't move when he does this.
[292:33.47]And he sucks you in.
[292:34.22]He does guaranteed damage.
[292:36.80]What'd I do?
[292:48.85]What is wrong with him?
[292:55.34]Get out of here!
[293:19.17]You have to use the shotgun?
[293:20.46]God damn it.
[293:26.71]I'm just gonna run through it.
[293:28.59]Shotgun and point blank.
[293:34.55]He had glowy hands, did he?
[293:40.18]Make sure I have enough shotgun bullets.
[293:50.91]God damn it.
[294:09.58]Die!
[294:10.14]Dude, what the fuck?
[294:13.08]I have no health.
[294:14.77]I need to...
[294:15.96]Are there grenades I can just blow myself up with?
[294:27.87]Alright, you shotgun and then when his hands glow, shoot his hands.
[294:33.99]Just kill me.
[294:37.84]Fucking Homer Simpson ass.
[294:40.65]Screaming lady laugh, lady thing, whatever the hell, screaming loud.
[294:53.91]I got it.
[295:07.53]Let's do it.
[295:08.75]I'm ready.
[295:11.95]I'm not gonna take one single point of damage.
[295:15.65]And if I do, it'll make me stronger.
[295:39.23]That's total dog shit.
[295:40.75]They bounce off the blade.
[295:42.10]I fucking can't believe it.
[296:18.77]Quiet.
[296:26.23]Hey, I'm the dev.
[296:27.00]I'm so demented.
[296:28.00]I made this game in a fugue state and I have no idea how you're beating it.
[296:57.11]Oh.
[297:14.66]I'm gonna die!
[297:25.02]Fuck!
[297:26.61]Everything fell apart.
[297:29.94]Shit.
[297:31.27]Everything fell apart so crazily.
[297:38.96]spam click with the saw, don't hold, but that hurts my ears.
[297:52.02]What the fuck, that's insane!
[297:54.00]Look at this!
[297:56.55]That might be a reset moment.
[298:03.50]so
[298:11.97]Thank you.
[298:16.51]Unnecessary damage!
[298:29.08]Wait, let him know he needs to aim for his head and only shoot his hands when they light up.
[298:42.18]Devstrat is pretty good.
[298:49.14]Only shoot the hands when they light up.
[299:06.00]so
[299:14.83]Alright, let's go.
[299:15.68]This is the one.
[299:16.14]I'm actually gonna do it right now.
[299:37.95]That was bad RNG.
[299:39.51]Bad RNG.
[299:44.60]Fuck!
[299:52.41]I can't afford any more mistakes.
[300:00.66].
[300:08.03].
[300:08.07].
[300:08.07]I can't get hit once!
[300:09.63]Oh my god!
[300:13.08]Okay, I have to shoot him with a shotgun.
[300:15.60]Alright, it's three.
[300:18.87]Three, five, three, five, three, five, three, five, three, five.
[300:25.76]There's more to do.
[300:28.24]I'm gonna get killed by the bugs.
[300:38.55]Yes!
[300:39.57]Oh no, I forgot you get a full heal.
[300:41.50]Alright, yeah, let's go.
[300:42.73]Okay, okay, okay.
[300:43.74]I'm ready.
[300:48.01]Everything loaded up?
[300:50.70]Three, six, three, six, three, six, three, six.
[300:55.10]Shock on him when he's got you.
[300:56.95]Got it.
[300:57.53]Just go.
[301:01.41]Three is shotgun, that's all I care about.
[301:45.66]Chew the fuckin' hands!
[301:55.72]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[302:08.22]This is fucking stupid!
[302:11.19]I couldn't shoot his hands, he was invincible!
[302:15.03]I'm quieting down.
[303:00.40]Oh.
[303:37.30]Did you?
[303:41.96]Did I really just wake up?
[303:48.27]Was it a dream the whole time?
[303:54.82]What the fuck?
[303:58.71]Let the record show that as of 3 33 a.m.. What patient has survived phase one of
[304:04.61]Off the operation.
[304:09.36]I'm fucking demented.
[304:10.43]Prepare for phase two.
[304:13.67]Didn't I just kill that guy?
[304:14.84]I don't understand.
[304:16.30]I killed that guy.
[304:17.13]How?
[304:17.37]Why?
[304:20.82]Did he make me believe that I killed him so that he's doing like experience to my brain?
[304:32.59]That was crazy.
[304:34.25]Play the second one.
[304:37.83]Put the second one on the list.
[304:41.90]That was fun.
[304:42.66]That was just fun enough to see the whole thing through.
[304:46.83]It was good.
[304:48.90]for it being a DS game.
[304:51.18]I mean, it's a PC port, but I wonder how it would work on the DS.
[304:57.05]I wonder how much more I would either like it or not.
[305:00.61]I imagine it's probably more, maybe like a little more interesting on the DS.
[305:05.91]just because the gimmick of it existing on the DS is kind of, I mean, I called it a gimmick, but you know what I mean.
[305:14.28]You gotta do that in small bursts.
[305:17.25]What was the plot?
[305:18.12]I don't know.
[305:20.18]Uh... My...
[305:22.23]I guess my wife was murdered?
[305:25.20]And...
[305:27.50]It wasn't me, but there's this guy with the goggles on doing experiments to my head.
[305:34.30]And I don't know.
[305:35.30]I just know I woke up.
[305:39.95]Please, God, do not play the Steam port of the second game.
[305:46.45]Is it bad?
[305:53.60]Do not play the actual Steam for it.
[305:56.15]It's that bad.
[305:57.90]Okay.
[305:59.33]Well, that was great.
[306:00.23]I liked it.
[306:02.06]I was looking forward to playing this and I'm glad I did.
[306:03.97]It was cool.
[306:05.83]Take their word for it, it's probably pretty bad.
[306:07.38]Yeah.
[306:13.94]Is it on GOG?
[306:18.59]Is it strictly just either original hardware emulation or Steam?
[306:34.37]Okay.
[306:34.86]Well, we'll look into it.
[306:35.76]We'll see how it goes.
[306:45.14]but that's perfect timing to, I know all the Withering Rooms fans.
[306:50.97]We will go back to that in the next few days.
[306:54.67]Hey, I never anticipated I was going to really enjoy playing this for more than an hour or two, and I did.
[307:00.28]So we'll go back to Withering Rooms in a couple of days.
[307:08.17]Thanks for watching.
[307:09.04]Thanks for hanging out.
[307:10.94]You'll see me again probably... What's today?
[307:13.07]Wednesday?
[307:16.49]Let's go for like a Saturday.
[307:19.46]feeling a Saturday stream.
[307:27.65]And I will just go right to Withering Rooms.
[307:31.38]Because I know if I start with something else, we might end up in a scenario where I just stay that the whole time.
[307:38.83]I'll see you guys this weekend.
[307:40.04]Have a good rest of your night.
[307:43.85]Oh, this was on stream the whole time.
[307:46.65]Oops.
[307:48.02]Well, it was pretty demented, so.
[307:53.28]Take care.
[307:53.92]I said that weird.
[307:57.33]If you're wondering why I've been saying words weird sometimes now, it's because I've been playing with two headphones.
[308:04.91]That's a shock that should shock everybody here.
[308:19.91]Alright, see you later.
[308:21.50]Have fun with whatever else you're doing today.
[308:23.55]Take it easy.
[308:29.22]And bye-bye.
