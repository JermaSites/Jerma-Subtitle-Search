[04:22.52]I got it handled.
[04:23.32]I got it handled.
[04:27.71]When are you going to do that?
[04:29.55]I told you I got it handled already.
[04:32.55]when right now but you said it was all messed up and 30 seconds not even two seconds later you've got it hey it's handled that's all I'm telling you why do men speak hey sorry hey what's up poke yeah dude I'm so gay I'm surprised yeah I'm surprised you're up you had like a 12-hour stream yesterday are you how you feeling
[05:00.86]Oh, great.
[05:01.66]I was laying in bed for hours, too.
[05:03.31]I'm good.
[05:04.07]I checked on your stream and you were just lounging.
[05:08.07]I was kind of... You got the whole lounge set up.
[05:11.68]And then Vinny checked on my stream.
[05:13.50]He got a sofa, right?
[05:14.36]So I got a sofa, too.
[05:16.04]It's actually a pretty great way to do it.
[05:18.91]What did you stream poke for several hours?
[05:21.31]12, that is.
[05:23.49]Oh, you know, I got the Death Stranding 2.
[05:26.46]You know...
[05:27.95]I was playing it yesterday, and then I didn't realize there's a PlayStation Pro.
[05:31.85]I didn't know there's a PlayStation 5 Pro.
[05:35.68]Wait, there is?
[05:37.50]Yeah, there's a PlayStation 5 Pro.
[05:38.81]You guys might need to know this, because if you're going to play the GTA, you're going to want that.
[05:45.26]There's a PS5 Pro?
[05:47.10]Why do they keep doing this?
[05:48.93]They're working on the PS6 right now, too, so...
[05:51.71]Oh, Ster, by the way, Ster, if you guys had won yesterday, I was going to present the PS5 to you.
[05:58.81]I was wondering if that was going to happen when you bailed.
[06:01.50]And also, you're spoiling it now.
[06:03.98]What are you talking about?
[06:04.68]I didn't even earn it.
[06:06.98]The PS5.
[06:07.94]I want to earn it.
[06:09.30]People know about the PS5 thing, don't they?
[06:11.63]I think we talked about it like a dozen times, haven't we?
[06:14.37]I don't think we have.
[06:15.39]Maybe one time.
[06:17.49]We definitely talked about this.
[06:18.83]When you speak, people don't write it in their journals.
[06:23.04]Well, what if they already have a PS5, though?
[06:25.10]Do they just, like, sell it?
[06:29.47]Oh, no, it was only going to be... It was only if Ster and Poke and Snuffy won.
[06:35.58]Oh.
[06:36.36]See, Stan's won, and he got a free copy of the Scooby-Doo DLC.
[06:42.59]If Ster won, he would get a PS5.
[06:44.45]I feel like that's not fair.
[06:47.23]Wow.
[06:49.42]Jerm I heard your 3D printing used PS5 it is a used PS5 that's true wow what were you saying what I heard there's 3D printing happening of of stuff is that true you are going to be getting a small fit you can fit it in your hand you can hold it it's going to be big enough to hold it uh version of your toilet museum oh man that's so cool oh museum
[07:15.02]People say words.
[07:16.44]What about the inside, though?
[07:17.66]Yeah, does that have interior?
[07:18.70]That's what I was going to say.
[07:19.76]There will be an interior.
[07:22.29]Oh, sick.
[07:24.69]I feel like we make too nice of a house, one.
[07:27.77]Can you make it so the roof is like a hatch?
[07:30.41]You can see inside.
[07:31.75]I'm going all out for this.
[07:33.50]We're going to get in touch with a bunch of custom miniature builders.
[07:37.48]This is not just... We're going to go fucking all out.
[07:41.44]Dude.
[07:43.21]I love it.
[07:44.51]I'm excited.
[07:45.58]yeah thank you for having me be part of that thing man that was a lot of fun that was great I'm just glad people have a good time you did really good too up until you said please eliminate me well I you know it's I did it because of you guys I love you guys yeah I got that maybe we would have won too but we chose not to win because nepotism you know like I mean more yeah it would have been bad if we won again yeah
[08:13.61]we told snuffy that we were on the nepotism team and there's no way we were gonna win and she got sad she muted and just never came back besides the okay besides the coin flip
[08:25.74]I honestly, this is just between us horsemen here, right?
[08:30.05]Nobody else is listening.
[08:30.99]Okay, don't tell anybody.
[08:31.79]Don't tell anybody.
[08:32.73]No one knows.
[08:33.35]The casino was probably going to win anyway.
[08:35.33]I think they were the winner.
[08:36.45]I think they were.
[08:37.77]Yeah, they did really good.
[08:39.17]It was awesome.
[08:40.33]Yeah.
[08:40.68]Cool.
[08:41.32]There was a lot of build tech in there as well.
[08:43.80]Just the floor itself.
[08:45.12]The tables.
[08:46.06]The floor was immaculate.
[08:48.52]They had a full RP session from start to finish.
[08:51.71]There wasn't a break in the action at all.
[08:53.61]I think they would deserve the W.
[08:55.51]Our goal was just to make you laugh only.
[09:00.73]It would have worked.
[09:02.14]It was fucking hilarious.
[09:04.54]my goal was to if we weren't winning I was gonna um have pictures of my alien holding Grotto Beasts so it was just purely sucking up to you if I yeah that was that was the plan but you know I managed to get dinner so that worked out nicely that's true and hey eating is very important it is especially when you're tired from building toilets all day
[09:29.43]um speaking of getting hungry you know what else makes you hungry climbing it does and Ster and I I will say guys we have been effectively you know people play like league of legends for their stream stuff mostly it's like their anchor game like oh I play league I play Call of Duty climbing games have been the anchor game for Ster and I the last like three or four weeks
[09:52.46]I feel bad every time I open white knuckles like come on again so yeah you got into it alright cool alright I think you'll like I I played have either of you played it any of you yeah pokes played I haven't seen like anything I think you guys are gonna spoil it it's good I played about an hour I think you're gonna really enjoy it so
[10:15.95]Should we use the VoIP in-game?
[10:18.74]Yeah, that's the question.
[10:19.60]Should we do VoIP in-game?
[10:21.74]Absolutely.
[10:22.14]It's one of those.
[10:22.96]It's literally VoIP slop.
[10:24.36]Okay.
[10:24.74]Yeah.
[10:26.64]Alright.
[10:27.69]Who wants to... You're coming up with new genres.
[10:30.37]It's VoIP slop.
[10:34.77]That's true.
[10:35.62]Yeah, these new slop games where you talk to each other.
[10:38.92]It's a whole genre.
[10:40.39]Yeah.
[10:41.51]Oh, my game crashed.
[10:43.75]Walking and talking.
[10:45.44]Is there?
[10:46.80]Yeah, that's VoIP slop.
[10:52.79]What was the name of that walk?
[10:54.39]The big wall.
[10:54.91]Yeah, yeah.
[10:55.64]Yeah, I'm interested in that one, too.
[10:57.04]The big walk, The Long Drive.
[11:00.82]There's another drive game when we played.
[11:03.63]So we got to check that out one day, too.
[11:05.95]We were gonna, but remember, it was like it came off the Steam store.
[11:10.40]It was like deleted from the game store for like three days.
[11:12.74]And they were like, oh, sorry, we got deleted.
[11:14.50]We brought it back for some reason.
[11:15.70]It was weird.
[11:16.16]Yeah.
[11:17.43]We were going to play it.
[11:19.91]We're going to play a lot of stuff.
[11:21.37]Yeah.
[11:22.54]Alright, I'm gonna, um, jump in game.
[11:24.91]I'm gonna host.
[11:25.71]Wait, hold on.
[11:26.93]Very important.
[11:27.27]Wait, who's hosting?
[11:27.90]You wanna host?
[11:28.78]Change the render from whatever you started with.
[11:31.15]Uh, DX12 works best unless you have an AMD card.
[11:34.00]Is that correct?
[11:37.31]Um... Because it starts... The default is Vulcan.
[11:39.41]I wouldn't trust Vulcan with my fucking laundry.
[11:43.31]Okay.
[11:43.81]So just don't... Yeah, my Vulcan crashed.
[11:46.98]Okay, maybe that's why my graphics card is spitting at maximum fan right now.
[11:50.68]Okay, yeah.
[11:51.08]As someone who has Path of Exile open right now, would not trust Vulcan.
[11:55.44]Okay.
[11:55.64]Alright.
[11:58.21]I'll be with you guys in a second.
[11:59.75]Okay.
[12:00.01]I'm going to just start this up.
[12:02.07]DX12.
[12:02.47]Alright.
[12:08.81]Hey, you should upgrade from a GT 710.
[12:12.98]Can you even run a GT 710 anymore?
[12:16.16]Does that even fit in a slot anymore on any motherboards?
[12:20.91]I had a 660 GTX.
[12:24.01]Is it called GTX?
[12:25.03]I think so, right?
[12:25.55]I think it was, yeah, or GeForce, right?
[12:28.88]Was it just GeForce?
[12:31.58]No, no, there was like a GT something.
[12:33.00]There was like some sort of RTX form back in the day.
[12:38.63]I think it was GTX.
[12:40.17]Yeah, GTX.
[12:40.69]RTX, GeForce.
[12:45.94]660, gang.
[12:48.14]Dude, I remember having a 480, and I thought I was the queen of England.
[12:53.87]You are the fucking queen, man.
[12:55.43]I was like, I... This is... It was crazy.
[12:59.41]I thought I seriously was.
[13:04.64]Uh...
[13:08.30]I am in, and I'm ready whenever everybody's ready.
[13:13.06]Did he host for sure?
[13:14.41]I'm hosting, yeah.
[13:15.35]Did you get the invites?
[13:16.91]Is it invite only?
[13:19.17]Yes, I'm in there now.
[13:20.21]Oh, I got an invite.
[13:21.94]Yeah.
[13:22.64]Wear your best.
[13:24.10]Okay.
[13:25.34]Oh, you can't join if you're in your own game, I think.
[13:27.28]Okay.
[13:28.39]There you go.
[13:28.85]Is there a tutorial?
[13:29.55]Because I didn't do it.
[13:31.31]Um, yeah, kind of.
[13:33.30]You can just kind of do it right here, kind of.
[13:35.86]And, uh, I can teach you some stuff.
[13:37.54]It's not too tough.
[13:39.01]I think me and Poke probably.
[13:40.43]I can't hear you.
[13:41.79]Alright, muting.
[13:42.61]Oh, yeah, let's figure out the in-game VoIP.
[13:47.32]Um, okay.
[13:48.60]Can I hear anybody?
[13:51.04]Some real, like, talk-to-each-other slop.
[13:54.17]VoIP slop?
[13:54.63]No, like, what is that?
[13:56.90]What is my- What is happening?
[13:58.30]Friendship and- Oh, is someone pulling me?
[14:01.19]Gaming is like for nerds.
[14:03.34]Alright, I'm gonna have to turn everybody up.
[14:05.10]Hey, you're already climbing!
[14:06.12]You're already all the way up to the top of the mountain!
[14:07.77]You already beat the game!
[14:08.67]Oh, shit.
[14:10.28]I'm dying.
[14:11.68]So it's kind of like Breath of the Wild in the sense that some food gives you additional energy and you can actually... Wait, can you hear me?
[14:24.16]Yeah, I can hear you, but it does sound a little not great.
[14:30.11]But it's fine.
[14:33.29]Oh, press escape and you have on the top right individual sliders.
[14:39.07]How do we all sound?
[14:39.83]Are we sound okay?
[14:41.31]You sound good.
[14:43.05]Okay, where's the left punch, right punch, left punch, right punch, right punch, right punch?
[14:47.12]So you hold left click and you can climb and you can press space to do like a big jump.
[14:55.46]And if you hold right click, you can put your hand out to grab your buddies to help them up.
[14:59.67]I mean, I'm doing my character creator right now, which is important.
[15:03.39]Yeah, it's working.
[15:05.71]Yeah, we can all hear each other.
[15:10.10]gone does my microphone sound like crap to you how do I turn this upside down so it's the like the rick face no you know you sound fine you say I think it's just like I've had you turned up a little too high make sure you're using my person yeah top right setting escape top right
[15:40.34]Also, Poke, if you're trying to talk, you're not... Unfortunately, I'm not hearing you.
[15:51.46]I kinda like the Donald Duck hat.
[16:06.19]Wow, it looks like everyone's just in the settings.
[16:09.74]We're making our characters.
[16:14.76]Wow, I was really excited to watch this stream and they're just all configuring settings.
[16:21.11]Wow, look at how mad you are.
[16:22.41]I'm you trying to judge.
[16:28.40]Hey, I threw that at you yesterday.
[16:30.16]I did that as a special joke for you.
[16:34.42]I didn't catch it.
[16:35.39]How did you not catch it?
[16:36.57]I growled and everyone said he growled.
[16:38.21]Growled.
[16:38.79]LOL.
[16:40.80]I guess.
[16:41.56]I mean, you did it a bunch.
[16:42.42]I don't think you were doing it for me.
[16:43.57]I think you're... Alright, so how do you play?
[16:50.14]So left click, hold that, and you'll climb.
[16:54.84]And that's it.
[16:55.86]It's just hold left click.
[16:57.03]Okay.
[16:57.87]No.
[16:58.53]You can also press space or shift to do like big jumps.
[17:02.59]But they use more stamina.
[17:04.44]Right click.
[17:05.30]He doesn't do anything.
[17:07.42]Right click can help you.
[17:08.80]Watch.
[17:09.00]I'll show you something.
[17:09.88]Climb to the top.
[17:10.86]And I'll right click.
[17:12.27]And you can grab my hand.
[17:16.71]Oh.
[17:18.47]Yeah.
[17:19.46]So I'm putting my hand out.
[17:21.64]Uh-oh.
[17:26.06]Dude, I wonder if there's damage.
[17:30.13]In-game, yeah, there's fall damage.
[17:32.57]There's items.
[17:33.53]There's health.
[17:34.96]It's cool.
[17:36.26]It's actually really cool.
[17:37.74]Poke is a gun?
[17:41.65]He's trying to figure out whatever's going wrong with him.
[17:44.41]Something going wrong with Poke?
[17:46.65]Yeah, he doesn't have much time left.
[17:50.32]What the heck?
[17:52.27]Alright, so there's a jump.
[17:53.91]There's a sprint.
[17:54.99]There's a climb.
[17:55.97]There's a hold hand out.
[17:58.61]So, Steric, come here.
[18:01.70]If I hold my hand out and you hold your hand out, how do we grab that hand?
[18:07.36]I don't know.
[18:08.20]So, Jerm, climb.
[18:09.36]Does one of us have to be climbing?
[18:10.99]Yeah, climb.
[18:11.61]I'm going to hold my hand out.
[18:13.19]And it'll help you get up here more easily.
[18:14.95]And it'll use less stamina.
[18:16.95]Hello?
[18:17.99]Hey.
[18:18.41]Yes, Hypo.
[18:19.99]Yeah, I had to restart my...
[18:22.54]Oh, you can just like pull me up.
[18:24.71]There you go.
[18:25.57]Cool.
[18:29.65]Alright.
[18:30.25]I think I'm... I think we... Are we ready to try it?
[18:33.36]That's the most of it right there.
[18:35.18]Yeah.
[18:35.52]And then the rest is like items and health.
[18:37.34]You have to eat like coconuts and shit.
[18:38.70]You'll see.
[18:39.14]It's fun.
[18:40.09]Is there any way to mute myself?
[18:44.17]Can they hear me here?
[18:45.29]Okay, Chad.
[18:45.93]I can... I can hear you.
[18:47.58]We can hear you.
[18:48.04]We can hear you, pal.
[18:49.63]Moisture?
[18:50.25]You look like you're filming a vlog with your passport on.
[18:52.25]Guys, I can't mute, so I have to talk to my chat.
[18:54.19]One sec.
[18:55.19]Uh, Pogue, do you plan on losing weight this summer?
[18:57.14]Uh, yeah, I'm trying.
[18:58.14]Thanks so much.
[18:59.94]Alright guys, let's go do it!
[19:01.24]Dude, I'm like, your character is... You look like a fucking, like, boy scout or something.
[19:07.85]Thank you!
[19:08.29]I mean... What are you... I haven't seen you before.
[19:13.38]Ster is Ster.
[19:15.20]I'm... Green Charlie Brown.
[19:17.76]What am I?
[19:20.39]My character sucks!
[19:22.73]Whatever.
[19:24.08]No, your character's good.
[19:26.04]Okay.
[19:26.32]Change it, then.
[19:27.66]No.
[19:27.80]Put a smile on that.
[19:28.78]I already made the decision.
[19:32.63]Wait, am I a different, like, am I a good color?
[19:35.05]One of us should be, like, red or something.
[19:37.26]I don't see color.
[19:38.04]I can be red.
[19:39.04]I'll be red.
[19:39.96]I like red.
[19:40.68]No, Vinny, you're green.
[19:42.02]No, no, no, red's also good.
[19:43.67]That is your brand.
[19:45.17]Okay.
[19:46.15]That is your brand.
[19:48.15]Dude's looking like a tomato.
[19:50.22]Okay.
[19:50.78]Suddenly I see color.
[19:51.88]Thanks, buddy.
[19:52.74]Something about that voice.
[19:56.42]Okay, to any game developer out there, you want to make your game at least very positive on Steam.
[20:03.67]Have the mouth move when the voice happens, right?
[20:07.02]That's how to get mostly positive on Steam, I think.
[20:14.66]Oh, no!
[20:16.46]We crashed.
[20:17.26]We're gonna have to eat each other.
[20:18.63]But before we do that, let's try to climb a mountain.
[20:20.83]Oh, man.
[20:23.91]So, is the point of this to go up?
[20:27.56]We go up.
[20:28.14]Only up.
[20:31.26]Only up.
[20:31.60]So, we can bring stuff with us, but it, like, creates, you know, it makes us have less stamina.
[20:40.18]So...
[20:43.01]Oh, you caught it.
[20:43.73]Holy shit.
[20:45.03]Dude, 4th of July!
[20:46.86]Are there no key bindings?
[20:50.12]Like, is there a sprint?
[20:53.19]Shift is sprint.
[20:55.59]If you take out your weapon in front, like, it just grabs them.
[20:59.94]He looks so angry about everything.
[21:06.15]I'm not angry, I'm judging.
[21:08.11]Stop!
[21:08.53]Stop it!
[21:11.39]Hey, we have to do a, uh, Zelda Four Swords thing where one of us is, like, sleepy, one of us is grumpy, one of us is tired, one of us is angry, you know what I mean?
[21:19.90]And one of us is Doc.
[21:20.40]Every once in a while, it's so loud.
[21:22.46]It is pretty loud.
[21:23.18]Yeah.
[21:24.69]Yeah.
[21:26.73]Alright, fellas.
[21:27.83]I'm gonna, I'm gonna get started over this way.
[21:29.97]There's rare stuff and coconuts over here.
[21:33.03]Okay.
[21:35.76]How do you get still?
[21:36.62]So, okay, uh...
[21:39.54]So you see the stomach yellow on the bar?
[21:42.83]That's your hunger.
[21:44.43]Okay.
[21:44.71]Are there coconuts?
[21:52.46]Okay, I got a coconut.
[21:53.64]Yeah, so I'll show you what you do.
[21:55.22]Watch this.
[21:55.66]Watch this.
[21:59.32]Ooh.
[22:01.49]Now you can eat that.
[22:03.71]Oh, you seem so happy about it.
[22:06.09]Yeah, it's real good.
[22:09.48]I think you guys have played this.
[22:13.64]I think you guys are going to judge us.
[22:17.61]How many more coconuts are there?
[22:19.61]Wait, no one took the backpack.
[22:21.84]Yeah, backpacks.
[22:22.58]People are screaming in the chat that we need the backpack.
[22:25.76]Do we really need it?
[22:26.38]Oh, yeah.
[22:27.15]Shit.
[22:27.57]Someone should get that.
[22:28.85]This is not a backpack, right?
[22:30.43]This is bing bong?
[22:32.37]What is that?
[22:33.52]Huh.
[22:39.19]That was good.
[22:46.97]What can we do with him?
[22:50.07]I feel like he's important later.
[22:52.51]Yeah.
[22:53.08]I think if you bring him to the top, that's the special ending.
[22:55.48]Probably, yeah.
[22:59.28]Whoa!
[22:59.71]Oh my god.
[23:00.21]That was cool.
[23:01.15]How'd you do that?
[23:04.03]You just have to be far enough away, I think.
[23:06.01]What?
[23:07.68]Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[23:14.04]Alright, I'm going to try to climb up here.
[23:15.90]It's probably going to get me killed, but let's see.
[23:18.07]Let's get a shot.
[23:19.19]Let's try it.
[23:20.73]Yeah, there's rare shit up there, so.
[23:29.31]Here we go.
[23:31.35]It's so weird.
[23:31.85]You can hear them so far away.
[23:34.54]I'm assuming that's how you find each other.
[23:37.04]Yeah.
[23:41.26]Alright, I'm behind you.
[23:43.14]Cool, cool, cool.
[23:44.14]I think I can make it up.
[23:45.84]I'm up.
[23:46.19]I'm up.
[23:47.47]I'm reaching out my hand.
[23:48.85]Thank you.
[23:50.09]There's not much room up here.
[23:51.33]Yeah.
[23:51.51]But we got just enough.
[23:52.51]Okay, perfect.
[23:55.79]You said there's a treasure.
[23:56.78]Oh, there is a treasure right there.
[23:59.08]Yep.
[24:01.68]I heard a Five Nights at Freddy's sound.
[24:05.70]What was that?
[24:10.32]There's a lot of good stuff up here.
[24:11.92]We should throw it down for the guys.
[24:14.97]Hey, guys!
[24:17.43]We've got some good stuff!
[24:19.37]We've got a granola bar!
[24:20.52]If anybody wants a granola bar, it's currently unwrapped!
[24:25.62]What?
[24:25.88]We found a granola bar!
[24:27.09]Okay, we're coming.
[24:31.55]Come on up.
[24:32.41]Uh-oh.
[24:32.64]By the way...
[24:35.68]Vinny, Vinny's trapped under a rock and he's bleeding.
[24:39.19]And if you have any bandages or anything.
[24:43.31]I threw the rope by accident.
[24:46.29]Sorry.
[24:47.94]We might need that.
[24:53.70]I thought that was a in-game indicator of me picking items up.
[24:58.73]I was like, wow, that's fucking annoying.
[25:00.63]Like they need to delete that from the game.
[25:03.45]Yeah.
[25:04.11]Oh, he's already mad.
[25:07.90]Hey!
[25:09.08]Scouts, come on up here!
[25:12.78]No, we're on the top of the mountain because we're better at the game.
[25:17.53]Here, I'll play a tune for you.
[25:26.94]Can you hear us?
[25:36.92]Eat shit!
[25:41.98]Should I get down?
[25:46.57]There's like water up here.
[25:48.13]Yeah, I'm up here!
[25:52.14]Look at me jumping all the way up on the peak of the mountain.
[25:55.40]I've got tons of items.
[26:00.69]Look, here.
[26:01.57]I'm gonna throw this down.
[26:03.36]Did I get it right in the head?
[26:07.46]I got it right in the head.
[26:08.42]That was a fucking good shot.
[26:13.14]I got a drink.
[26:14.26]Alright, I'm coming down.
[26:20.66]Can I die?
[26:26.99]I died.
[26:27.75]I'm dead.
[26:28.33]You can die.
[26:28.94]I died.
[26:30.42]Yeah, I'm dead.
[26:31.38]I'm drinking all the fucking fluids.
[26:32.54]I don't care.
[26:35.38]You can die.
[26:36.04]And not only that, but you can resurrect people.
[26:38.55]But no one knew I was dead.
[26:42.60]Vini!
[26:44.78]Yeah, I'm dead.
[26:45.44]Can you see me?
[26:46.25]I'm a spooky ghost now.
[26:47.89]Yeah, why?
[26:49.51]Because I fucking fell off the cliff and I didn't let you guys know I was dying.
[26:54.88]Vini, come here.
[26:56.10]Vini, come here.
[26:57.12]Wait, I got a bandage.
[26:58.02]Can I, like, revive you?
[26:58.90]Go over there for a second.
[26:59.53]Go all the way over there.
[27:05.71]Yeah, poke.
[27:09.54]Yeah.
[27:12.42]You're very low.
[27:13.52]What the fuck is this?
[27:14.48]They're like hiding now?
[27:20.08]I'm gonna see if I can listen.
[27:25.23]Will you- will you stop it?
[27:34.20]You've had that on your soundboard for a day and you're just trying to get more use out of it.
[27:38.56]I like it a lot.
[27:39.60]It's very- it has a lot of utility.
[27:43.35]So we're already splitting up into friend groups, huh?
[27:49.40]I don't know.
[27:49.86]I guess.
[27:50.54]I don't know.
[27:51.06]I guess you have to be with me.
[27:54.40]That's okay.
[27:57.01]Yikes!
[27:58.83]Alright, cool.
[27:59.75]Totally real.
[28:00.59]Totally real scare.
[28:01.41]Got it.
[28:04.74]So what now, fellas?
[28:06.36]Do I just haunt you?
[28:07.20]I say we restart because you're dead.
[28:09.72]I say we build a raft.
[28:14.80]I mean, you can go on without me.
[28:16.05]I'll just haunt.
[28:16.97]It's fine.
[28:17.87]Do you have food?
[28:21.21]How do we resurrect you?
[28:24.64]Do we have food?
[28:26.02]Do we have any food?
[28:28.12]You have to continue up the mountain before you can save me.
[28:30.74]Oh, I know, but do we have any food for us?
[28:36.15]Yeah.
[28:37.37]I got coconut.
[28:39.19]And then you got trail mix.
[28:40.27]Do you have trail?
[28:41.45]Can I see it?
[28:43.15]I'm going to need it.
[28:45.03]I'm just gonna kill myself.
[28:49.59]I'm gonna smash the coconut on his head.
[28:51.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:52.40]Poke, hold on.
[28:53.26]Where's the trail mix?
[29:00.31]In my backpack, probably.
[29:02.51]Check my bag.
[29:03.11]There's nothing in there.
[29:04.00]Did you eat it?
[29:05.70]No.
[29:06.28]Ster, did you eat it?
[29:07.84]I didn't eat it.
[29:08.40]There's nothing in there.
[29:11.41]Poke, you were at like 1% volume.
[29:14.47]Yeah, you're really low-punk.
[29:16.18]I turned you all the way up.
[29:17.84]It's always me.
[29:19.14]I always have a mic issue.
[29:20.96]Yeah, settings guy over here.
[29:24.80]Oh, what the hell?
[29:26.09]Oh, I'm so glad I ran away.
[29:28.15]I'm so glad I ran away.
[29:30.53]It was Steam.
[29:32.19]Steam lowered my shit to 20.
[29:34.25]Oh, man.
[29:36.28]So sorry.
[29:36.56]Oh, that's funny.
[29:38.50]I ran the fuck away, too, and it was still loud.
[29:42.47]Alright, so should we just restart the map?
[29:45.61]Alright.
[29:45.95]Yeah.
[29:46.56]Yeah.
[29:48.08]God damn it.
[29:53.44]I'm so sorry, guys.
[29:54.42]I fucked this all up.
[29:55.09]No, that was a god damn it on my mic.
[29:56.67]Not a god damn it that we had to restart.
[30:00.05]I'm leaving.
[30:01.33]Alright, we just leave?
[30:02.71]Are we leaving?
[30:04.78]Okay, I guess we're leaving.
[30:07.64]Okay.
[30:11.23]Well, that was that was actually pretty fun.
[30:12.93]That was funny.
[30:13.45]I like that.
[30:19.73]So if you're dead, you're dead dead.
[30:23.22]Oh, I should probably.
[30:26.14]So if you're dead, you're dead dead.
[30:27.96]Is there like a revive point where you can get revived?
[30:34.91]Fail RP, can you talk in game please?
[30:37.21]We're not in a lobby.
[30:39.02]join you can revive teammates with a medicine item oh okay alright alright alright alright I'm coming in hey
[31:07.06]My first day with a passport in my hands.
[31:10.13]Oh, where are my friends?
[31:12.91]Why am I in a game alone?
[31:15.31]Oh, OK.
[31:19.36]Hey, what's up, dude?
[31:21.58]Yo.
[31:23.34]Wait, whose lobby is this?
[31:24.66]I don't know, but it's only you and me in here.
[31:28.39]I think they left because a hacker got in.
[31:31.83]Oh really?
[31:33.57]Yeah, get out now.
[31:34.65]Wait, what?
[31:37.83]What do you mean a hat?
[31:39.61]This is why I wanted to corroborate with everybody before we did this.
[31:46.62]How is that?
[31:47.20]What happened?
[32:00.80]Oh, okay.
[32:01.76]I see.
[32:14.06]I think.
[32:15.62]I think that's already there.
[32:21.39]Just make it invite only.
[32:23.33]I think I already have that.
[32:39.79]Let me see.
[32:43.88]Let me see.
[32:44.86]I think.
[32:49.85]I don't know.
[32:50.83]Maybe everybody has to have it turned on.
[32:52.57]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[33:05.79]Uh.
[33:13.98]Yeah, I already have all that on.
[33:24.15]That's all already on.
[33:31.38]Are you guys talking in here?
[33:34.41]No.
[33:36.39]Are you trying to do it again?
[33:37.63]He's doing an invite-only code now.
[33:40.17]He sent an invite now.
[33:41.12]Okay, alright.
[33:42.36]Cool.
[33:43.50]Yeah, this is peak.
[33:47.14]Hey!
[33:48.78]Hey.
[33:49.44]This is not- WHAT THE HELL?!
[33:54.35]See you later.
[33:56.11]Was that Ster or no?
[33:57.61]No, I'm not in the game.
[33:58.95]Oh god!
[34:00.26]Alright, so are we gonna play a different game today?
[34:03.22]What the fuck was that?
[34:05.86]Just set lobby mode to invite only, what is the problem?
[34:08.95]I have you guys, let me try it.
[34:10.53]I think they can still get in.
[34:18.88]Should I host?
[34:20.04]I can change it to invite only.
[34:22.81]Yeah, change settings before lobby.
[34:30.66]What the fuck?
[34:32.44]Okay, alpha dog is taking control.
[34:35.04]I alpha'd you, dog.
[34:39.59]It's apparently an exploit in the game itself.
[34:42.95]Holy shit.
[34:47.55]I got it.
[34:49.52]Apparently, it can still happen.
[34:53.96]We'll try filling it up before he joins.
[34:55.62]A server ID in one of the corners?
[34:57.77]I don't see one.
[34:58.85]When you enter a lobby, top left, it will have a game version lobby ID and stuff.
[35:02.91]Hide it.
[35:03.41]So just don't show anything until we're in the game?
[35:05.44]Is that how it works?
[35:10.76]Yeah, mine just says version at the top left in the game.
[35:14.97]Yeah, no, that was funny, though.
[35:16.38]It's okay.
[35:17.74]They can still join in full games, apparently.
[35:23.23]Everybody's Steam profile has to be set to private.
[35:29.15]I think everybody here probably already has that, though.
[35:31.98]Vinny and Luke have played this before.
[35:33.60]How has this not been a problem for you?
[35:35.20]They just found out the tricks now to get into lobbies, probably.
[35:38.03]That's why.
[35:42.19]Alright, well, let's try that.
[35:43.83]Just set everything to private.
[35:46.46]uh where do you do that in this account yeah go to steam then go to your like my uh like my page and you can just go to profile and then you go to edit profile just make everything ever just make the whole thing private that's crazy even in a full lobby they can get in alright my profile private there you go done yeah I just said everything to private
[36:22.27]uh invited Ster and where the hell you are the alpha invite only apparently they can still get in I think we'll see I'm just now the guy's probably looking for my steam account so you guys need to get in fast before he finds mine and it's gonna be full it's four and he can't do anything we're good well no that's what they're saying like a fifth person can join yeah what exploit yeah oh
[36:52.06]Apparently a fifth person could join.
[36:53.92]There's a code at the top left apparently that happens, I guess.
[36:59.31]I need a second invite.
[37:02.89]Or we could all just go to Grandmaster and League of Legends.
[37:05.86]Yeah.
[37:07.96]I mean... Are you on Steam?
[37:09.99]Yeah, I also have another idea if this is not going to work.
[37:12.49]We could play Outlast Trials.
[37:17.80]We could pivot.
[37:21.07]download that whole game just so that we can like fucking watch like revenge porn what I'm so that's a weird thing to unmute too Jerma's not on Jerma's not on my steam oh I gotta add you on steampunk I never had you I don't I have nobody damn alright I get can you give me your like friend code thing yes yes yes right here
[37:51.34]Thank you.
[37:53.64]Thank you.
[37:57.51]And here is my invite to you.
[38:07.83]So somebody was saying, let me confirm this with everyone's chats here.
[38:12.55]Is there something in the top left that will just always be shown at some point?
[38:19.01]uh what do you mean hide the text there's apparently text in the top left with something overlaid on the top of obs you all four of us have to make like a little sensor bar in the top left that's the game seed that's I don't see a seed I just see version yeah I see a version that's all I don't see a seed
[38:40.83]Yeah, I didn't see one of those.
[38:41.59]Maybe when we're in the lobby?
[38:43.22]Maybe.
[38:44.18]Let's just start vending.
[38:44.84]Let's see what it says real quick.
[38:46.86]Yeah, I'll just make like a little thing.
[38:48.73]Hold on.
[38:50.31]Just to go over.
[38:52.71]We can see right now.
[38:54.49]I think you gotta be in game and then you can see the seed when you're in a map.
[38:58.36]See, this is my fault because I died.
[39:01.56]Sorry, guys.
[39:02.73]No, it's better that it happened now than later.
[39:05.17]That's true.
[39:07.75]There's no code when you're in the game.
[39:09.26]There's no code.
[39:11.17]Is it in your profile or something?
[39:13.48]Like, when you open up your passport?
[39:15.76]The seed is how the map generates.
[39:17.10]You can't join through it.
[39:18.66]Weird.
[39:23.87]Okay.
[39:23.99]Yeah, I mean, I was just not able to invite you guys.
[39:26.67]That was the problem.
[39:27.88]Like, I set it to invite only, and then I couldn't send invites.
[39:31.84]It was real weird.
[39:33.34]So, I don't know.
[39:36.29]We just have to join through poke, I guess.
[39:38.60]Did I get the right Druma, or did I just get a fake Druma?
[39:41.36]I'm gone fishing, that's me.
[39:44.54]I sent you an invite.
[39:48.07]I got the guy with the orange hair.
[39:49.91]Oh, okay, good.
[39:53.39]Leaked.
[39:55.56]Johnny, cut all of this.
[39:59.18]Okay, I'm inviting now.
[40:00.78]I'm inviting now.
[40:01.50]You guys have to join really... Oh, I'm scared.
[40:07.43]Be not afraid, pup.
[40:10.32]Yeah, I mean, I have like a sensor bar at the top left.
[40:13.13]I don't know if that's gonna matter or anything.
[40:17.01]Yeah, also, you should probably mute your game audios, guys, in case like it's fucking crazy shit.
[40:22.88]I would say that's probably a good idea.
[40:24.57]I'm muting all the in-game audio.
[40:26.61]I'm muting.
[40:28.75]What?
[40:28.95]I'm taking a bet.
[40:29.72]He didn't seem like he was crazy.
[40:31.24]How are we gonna hear each other?
[40:33.82]For now, until we start.
[40:37.14]It's such a... No, no, it's alright.
[40:39.24]I think I didn't seem like he was crazy.
[40:40.68]Like, it's... What if you're just gonna ask?
[40:43.98]Like, hey man, can we just play a little bit?
[40:49.57]That's funny.
[40:52.17]You guys are scared of words?
[40:55.24]Alright, am I... Who wants to play, like, rip out someone's heart and eat it game and is like, I hope someone doesn't join and says a word to me?
[41:02.79]That's right.
[41:03.29]Words are cut heavier than swords, they say.
[41:08.30]The pen is mightier.
[41:10.05]Alright, so I need... You invite?
[41:14.49]Looks like I've been invited.
[41:15.89]I'm joining.
[41:19.14]I was not going to capture the screen.
[41:20.16]I'm going to see what pops up in the top left.
[41:23.00]We did it.
[41:23.68]I see version number.
[41:27.79]There's nothing else up there.
[41:28.77]Just the version number.
[41:33.30]There's nothing else I can see.
[41:34.38]Maybe just don't open your passports.
[41:36.24]Oh, my God.
[41:44.45]I think we're good.
[41:46.75]There's nothing there.
[41:48.92]I don't know.
[41:50.30]I'm pulling out random shit from the chat.
[41:56.97]Are we good?
[41:59.94]Hold on.
[42:01.06]I think we're in game.
[42:05.16]Jeremy, you got a mutie.
[42:06.47]Oh.
[42:10.94]No one else can join.
[42:12.31]No fifth secret penis chat member will join now.
[42:16.03]There's no fifth secret penis member?
[42:17.93]Has it been confirmed?
[42:21.12]We're good now.
[42:21.82]Once we're in game, I think we're really locked in.
[42:24.62]We're good.
[42:25.02]And even so, they'd have to climb up the mountain to us.
[42:27.11]So it's fine.
[42:27.71]We're good.
[42:28.37]Okay.
[42:30.95]Now I'm fucking paranoid.
[42:36.58]Okay, I thought that was the hacker.
[42:39.90]I seriously was like, okay, here we go.
[42:41.52]We gotta get out.
[42:42.29]Don't, okay, actually I keep thinking that's a fucking hacker.
[42:45.21]You know what, how about this?
[42:46.51]Hacker, if you join us and you touch us, we die.
[42:48.87]We have to run away from the hacker.
[42:49.98]Let's move.
[42:51.04]If you join us, you gotta be funny.
[42:53.56]New element.
[42:54.34]I thought that was the hacker.
[42:55.48]I thought the text off screen was the hacker.
[43:03.30]This is insane.
[43:06.44]We have to eat food, don't we?
[43:11.37]That's okay.
[43:12.07]We're good.
[43:12.44]We're invite only.
[43:13.32]We don't have to eat food yet.
[43:14.56]We have, um, we get hungry slowly.
[43:17.36]I got the backpack so you can throw shit in my backpack.
[43:21.19]Alright.
[43:23.41]Jerem, I swear, don't worry, dude.
[43:25.35]It's fine.
[43:25.82]I got you, buddy.
[43:27.14]Alright.
[43:27.40]The second I hear, like, an explosion, I'm fucking all deaf for it.
[43:34.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:35.13]Same.
[43:35.41]And I'll just scream really loudly and no one will hear anything that anyone says.
[43:39.08]It's gonna be fine.
[43:40.87]Alright, so we're just going.
[43:43.60]It's them.
[43:46.02]They're doing it.
[43:46.72]They're doing it.
[43:47.47]Alright.
[43:48.05]He's going to do that for the rest of the day.
[43:49.47]You know that, right?
[43:50.47]Yeah.
[43:51.80]What?
[43:52.74]Your name has er in it.
[43:55.22]Er?
[43:56.81]Yes, sir.
[43:59.33]talking about over there.
[44:00.93]I don't know.
[44:01.35]You paired them perfectly for the House Flipper.
[44:06.80]Yeah.
[44:07.68]I think they complement each other very well.
[44:11.41]They do.
[44:16.43]Alright, Jeremiah, I have a task for you.
[44:18.93]Sure.
[44:20.12]Can you put these coconuts in my backpack?
[44:22.48]Absolutely.
[44:30.80]I took a bite out of one.
[44:32.47]I did take a bite out of one.
[44:34.35]It's okay.
[44:35.35]Now that you have to throw against the wall.
[44:37.69]Just hold Q. There you go.
[44:42.91]Okay.
[44:43.03]I can hold those in my backpack if needed.
[44:45.66]Or you can keep them in your inventory.
[44:46.94]But I get like a weight.
[44:49.82]Backpack means less weight.
[44:52.28]I just heard one of them scream.
[44:54.13]I'm getting baited into fucking you, man.
[44:56.65]In the video, he...
[44:59.32]Won't take up less space if you don't half it.
[45:01.95]Oh, is that how that works?
[45:03.47]Hey guys, what are you doing?
[45:08.29]He jumps on you as you lay down.
[45:09.81]Go ahead.
[45:11.65]I'm just jumping on him.
[45:13.36]That's kind of weird, man.
[45:14.88]You know there's like a death wall incoming, yeah?
[45:19.30]No.
[45:19.92]Wait, is there actually?
[45:20.66]Oh shit, Night Rain?
[45:22.87]Is there actually a Night Rain thing?
[45:24.43]Which I've only played that one time with you guys.
[45:27.94]Wait, really?
[45:28.58]You only played once?
[45:29.85]Yeah.
[45:29.97]I just had, I don't know.
[45:31.51]Jerma loves that game.
[45:34.24]Hey, Vinny, did you hear I gave Night Rain a 0.0?
[45:39.93]Can you explain what happened?
[45:41.88]No, I can't.
[45:43.04]I can't do it.
[45:47.91]I like it.
[45:49.31]No, it's okay.
[45:50.41]Let me explain.
[45:51.43]I said the single player of Night Rain was a 0.0.
[45:55.50]I said the multiplayer of Night Rain was an 8.7.
[45:59.96]I think it's great.
[46:01.62]That's good.
[46:02.24]That's a good score.
[46:07.47]Oh, you got the backpack?
[46:09.47]I got the backpack, yeah.
[46:16.84]Okay.
[46:18.28]Oh, by the way, guys, if you look back and do right click, you could get the arm.
[46:23.79]I'm falling.
[46:24.23]I'm falling.
[46:24.73]Somebody grab me.
[46:25.21]Somebody grab me.
[46:25.79]Somebody grab me.

[46:35.55]I don't have enough stamina.
[46:39.25]I don't have enough stamina either.
[46:47.32]I thought, because Vinny, you died falling and I thought I was gonna die.
[46:52.19]I died up here because I was an idiot and I tried to put rope down and I didn't know how to do it.
[46:56.81]So I think we can do this if you want to try it.
[46:59.16]There's good stuff up here.
[47:02.10]I'm up.
[47:03.02]I'll give you the hand.

[52:59.93]Yeah.

[53:06.19]Get that stand.
[53:06.59]This is bad.
[53:07.26]This is bad.
[53:07.80]This is real bad.
[53:09.02]Real bad.
[53:09.36]It's doable.
[53:09.94]It's doable.
[53:12.16]Okay.
[53:12.40]It's doable.
[53:13.36]Yeah, Polka.
[53:14.21]I'm going with you this way.
[53:16.73]I don't even know if this is a good idea.
[53:18.79]We'll find out.
[53:26.70]Are you getting stamina?
[53:28.23]Yep.
[53:32.97]Guys, I'm lost.

[53:38.50]Be careful.
[53:39.20]Alright, you got this, Charm.
[53:42.10]Okay.
[53:43.74]I feel like we're missing someone.
[53:45.06]We are.
[53:45.36]Ster!
[53:47.15]Ster, you don't... Actually, you might be alright.
[53:52.79]Ster, I'll drop some rope for you.
[53:54.76]You want that?
[53:56.22]I need to do it on my own.
[53:58.88]It's too late, buddy.
[54:01.74]It's gonna be Ster.
[54:05.49]It's gonna be Ster.
[54:07.49]It's gonna be May.
[54:19.99]Alright.
[54:21.27]We're good.
[54:21.69]We're good.
[54:22.95]Food!
[54:23.83]Nice.
[54:25.73]Nice.
[54:26.79]I got some apples.
[54:28.07]Who is most hungry?
[54:29.45]I'll put it in your bag.
[54:34.20]Uh, I think I'm... does that... does... Star, how are you doing on food?
[54:38.46]I'm good.
[54:38.94]I'm good.
[54:39.24]I got extra apples I found.
[54:41.91]I'll lift you guys.
[54:51.84]That jump didn't go anywhere.
[54:57.81]Alright, so do I have to right-click, too, to grab your hand?
[55:00.94]I don't think so.
[55:02.06]Oh, no, yeah, he just pulled me without it.
[55:05.86]Actually, it seems better that I didn't have my right-click.
[55:08.53]Yeah.
[55:09.47]It seemed like when you both had your hands out, it wasn't doing it.
[55:12.63]This is gonna be tricky.
[55:14.33]This is a little tricky, yeah.
[55:16.06]I think Ster has the right idea, though.
[55:17.92]We have to fit through this little... What if we just lived here?
[55:21.60]What's the movie where the dude's stuck in the rocks?
[55:25.87]Um...
[55:27.63]Hole.
[55:28.77]Holes.
[55:30.21]127 hours.
[55:31.39]Yeah, that could happen to us.
[55:32.64]It happened when I played this.
[55:33.76]I might need a hand here.
[55:35.48]I might need a hand.
[55:35.98]Help him.
[55:36.34]Okay.
[55:39.08]You good?
[55:40.02]Yeah, I'm good.
[55:40.88]Stairs good.
[55:41.47]You guys see this route right here?
[55:42.83]Don't climb.
[55:44.03]Scale that side and left side.
[55:45.21]Get on the rock right there.
[55:46.29]Boom, bang, bang.
[55:47.67]I'm looking pretty good up here, fellas.
[55:49.53]This is a good one.
[55:50.32]Yeah.
[55:51.56]That's a good idea, Poke, but I think I'm scared to do it.
[55:54.94]Alright.
[55:56.08]Okay, now what?
[55:57.77]How the hell are we going to get up here?
[56:00.27]Oh boy.
[56:01.01]I'm going to jump.
[56:01.87]I'm going to jump.
[56:03.06]It's real foggy.
[56:04.72]Oh boy.
[56:07.56]Going down.
[56:09.11]Yeah, I think Poke is right.
[56:10.09]Sorry guys.
[56:14.37]It's a bad idea.
[56:15.42]Bad idea.
[56:16.56]Yeah, I'm going to follow Poke.
[56:17.94]Yeah, that's the right call.
[56:23.51]Thanks man.
[56:24.59]The music just got scary.
[56:28.46]I'm scared.
[56:28.74]Ster, aren't you a professional White Knuckle?
[56:31.29]Yeah.
[56:32.43]And you're scared by a little music?
[56:34.73]True.
[56:34.85]Yeah, but White Knuckle, you don't just hold left click to climb.
[56:38.74]Oh, it's so much more to it, right, Ster?
[56:41.54]We know.
[56:43.12]Alright, you fucking 0.0 Night Rain, you can't do this to me.
[56:47.17]Bro, I'm ranked higher on you than on White Knuckle.
[56:50.15]Jerma?
[56:52.22]Yeah, but that's because I... Yeah, but... I mean, I was tired.
[56:58.71]He was tired, to be fair.
[57:00.01]I usually have a peanut butter sandwich before I stream, and I didn't have it that day.
[57:05.18]It's alright.
[57:07.54]Poke, did you see the strats for getting through Act 2?
[57:09.82]No, I... No.
[57:12.74]Dude, it's fucked up.
[57:14.44]The elevator?
[57:15.16]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[57:15.90]That's like the hardest part of the whole game for me.
[57:18.09]And Ster's like, oh, look at this.
[57:19.61]You didn't...
[57:21.72]Oh my god!
[57:22.94]I'm going this way.
[57:32.50]Chat, how do I regain rope?
[57:37.45]I know, it's a fun... Yeah, I laughed.
[57:39.49]It's funny, but... Drink pineapple juice.
[57:43.07]Yeah.
[57:44.90]The fuck?
[57:47.10]Ooh, I might have fallen away, guys.
[57:49.41]I feel like my rope regenerated once already.
[57:55.24]Yeah, when do we get the spider upgrade?
[57:59.71]We can make her up here, y'all.
[58:01.97]I think I think I'm a genius with it.
[58:04.43]Oh, is there a path?
[58:06.32]Yeah.
[58:08.84]There's a couple.
[58:09.60]There's a couple.
[58:10.28]There are viable methods.
[58:12.09]We're good.
[58:13.27]Follow your heart.
[58:14.41]Follow your heart.
[58:15.23]I'm going this way.
[58:15.85]This is this seems to be more crevices here.
[58:31.42]Can we all lick it?
[58:39.05]Is that bad?
[58:44.37]Big lollipop.
[58:47.30]Big lollipop.
[58:51.04]Oh my God, that was loud.
[58:52.03]That was.
[58:52.83]That was a loud lollipop.
[58:56.29]Anybody get?
[58:58.18]I'm kind of getting hungry.
[58:59.06]I got my bars kind of big.
[59:03.46]Mine too, but... Oh, coconuts.
[59:08.93]I'm gonna use this toy and knock him down.
[59:13.69]Oh my god, I'm a genius.
[59:15.19]That actually was a good idea.
[59:16.68]Oh!
[59:17.58]No!
[59:19.62]Oh, one of them fell.
[59:20.74]Alright, who has the biggest bar?
[59:23.30]Wait, there's two up there.
[59:28.27]This is enough for us to all eat one.
[59:31.29]I'm gonna die.
[59:34.24]Drop some rope.
[59:38.01]Wait, I was standing.
[59:38.93]I was standing on it.
[59:41.05]Did you get the coconut?
[59:43.19]Yeah.
[59:43.93]Here.
[59:46.24]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[59:47.76]Oh, my God.
[59:49.52]You.
[59:50.36]That was our only food source.
[59:53.13]Do you need an apple?
[59:56.27]No, I'm good.
[59:56.85]You got an apple?
[59:57.53]I had a half.
[59:59.46]Hold on.
[60:00.08]Let me feed it to you, honey.
[60:03.57]I didn't do anything.
[60:05.45]Oh, it said feed you.
[60:07.01]I think you just bugged it out.
[60:11.68]Guys, rope.
[60:12.90]You don't have to climb the tree.
[60:13.80]I dropped rope.
[60:15.68]I'm learning the tree tech.
[60:18.72]Is this connected?
[60:19.70]Oh, okay.
[60:21.20]I get it.
[60:22.75]Yeah, yeah.
[60:23.59]Yeah, we're good.
[60:24.21]We're good.
[60:24.67]This bridge is going to fall.
[60:26.77]There's apples and shit up here if you needed.
[60:28.35]I got coconuts in my backpack if anyone's hungry.
[60:30.71]I would love to have one.
[60:32.92]You want a coconut?
[60:35.08]Alright, I got you.
[60:38.30]Just grab one.
[60:45.17]What does a lollipop even do?
[60:47.20]The lollipop gives you infinite stamina for like 20 seconds, and then you crash, like you sugar crash hard.
[60:56.91]Yeah, I just tried one.
[60:58.01]This bridge is gonna fall.
[61:00.83]Yeah, we're not gonna make it all together on that bridge.
[61:03.43]I think we all have to run at the same time.
[61:04.73]It's gonna be Lethal Company all over again.
[61:05.93]Can't you do one at a time?
[61:07.55]Maybe?
[61:07.75]Here, Ster.
[61:08.60]Catch.
[61:14.54]Here, Ster.
[61:15.62]Catch.
[61:19.59]How do you catch?
[61:21.87]Yeah, how do you catch?
[61:25.88]Ster, I don't know about this.
[61:28.44]Help!
[61:29.10]Help!
[61:29.84]Help!
[61:32.52]Don't.
[61:33.76]Wait, no!
[61:35.38]Stop!
[61:35.86]I'm- You're not doing it right!
[61:37.24]You're not doing it right!
[61:38.41]I'm not helping you now.
[61:39.23]That's the boy who cried to climb up the wall and die.
[61:46.52]I'm getting the fuck away from you.
[61:49.48]Wait, help!
[61:57.28]Do the bridge text, sir.
[61:59.66]Grown-ass man.
[62:01.59]I'm gonna go.
[62:02.17]I'm doing bridge.
[62:03.98]Grown-ass men with mind sickness.
[62:05.88]I'm doing bridge.
[62:13.05]Hook, how you doing on food?
[62:14.01]You hungry?
[62:17.14]I'm good.
[62:17.60]How about you, Sterp?
[62:20.08]Do you need anything to eat?
[62:21.82]Do you need anything, honey?
[62:24.35]No.
[62:25.03]That bridge was totally secure.
[62:29.49]Here, I got you.
[62:30.17]Get up here.
[62:33.94]Ooh, nice.
[62:41.81]Where's your health bar?
[62:42.63]Is it just the lightning bolt?
[62:46.31]It is your stamina.
[62:47.94]Everything is stamina bar.
[62:49.72]So when you take damage, you have less stamina.
[62:51.86]Oh.
[62:53.12]Yeah, until you die, die.
[62:54.82]And then you have got nothing.
[62:59.87]I see smoke.
[63:00.77]What the hell?
[63:01.88]Yeah, that smoke looks like the ocean and it's giving me like this weird sense of like I'm sideways.
[63:06.82]Oh, you're right.
[63:08.28]Chain launcher.
[63:10.77]I don't like it.
[63:11.77]Don't eat your marshmallows yet, but we have a new backpack if anyone wants to grab one.
[63:15.48]Oh, nice.
[63:15.98]Wait, they lowered this thing.
[63:16.90]This used to be way higher.
[63:19.40]There, Ster.
[63:19.84]Take some of these.
[63:20.46]If you guys die, this is a res.
[63:21.80]This is the res area.
[63:22.97]Now, if there's no res, that'll give you a free item, I think.
[63:28.45]There.
[63:28.78]I'm opening it?
[63:29.80]Yeah, do it.
[63:32.58]Don't breathe that in.
[63:35.57]What does it do?
[63:45.10]Can you like open it?
[63:47.20]Open it as soon as possible, people are saying.
[63:50.79]Open it.
[63:51.89]Oh!
[63:52.51]No!
[63:54.90]What?
[63:55.76]No!
[63:58.54]What?
[63:59.06]No!
[64:00.74]What is wrong with it?
[64:04.16]He gave me a bunch of effects, like bad ones on my stand bar.
[64:08.08]I think it's random.
[64:09.50]Oh, okay.
[64:11.13]We'll fix that up with the campfire and the marshmallows.
[64:18.46]So what do the marshmallows do?
[64:21.46]You eat them.
[64:21.88]They're like dates.
[64:22.60]You eat them.
[64:24.46]Okay, this is an important question.
[64:27.63]How do you guys do your marshmallow?
[64:29.33]Do you do lightly toast it all the way around, burn the whole thing, barely toast it?
[64:34.55]medium rare well done burn it so hard it's pussing okay amateurs but that's alright the entire it takes about five to ten full minutes to get a perfect marshmallow wait look I'm gonna cook this bandage carcinogens are tasty
[65:01.19]Who wants a cooked bandage?
[65:04.00]Can you eat it?
[65:04.90]Anyone want a cooked lantern?
[65:07.50]Can you cook coconut?
[65:10.31]Cooked lantern?
[65:10.95]What?
[65:13.61]Damn!
[65:14.33]I just cooked this water.
[65:15.35]I cooked the rope.
[65:20.24]I just made you drink that, by the way.
[65:24.22]That gave me a lot of stamina.
[65:26.09]Is it better when you cook it?
[65:27.81]Fire's gone.
[65:28.99]I wasted it all on my bugle.
[65:32.23]You got a burnt bugle.
[65:33.97]What is a cooked lantern gonna do for us?
[65:38.74]Does it sound different?
[65:42.13]The rope is useless now?
[65:45.51]Microplastic burnt microplastics.
[65:48.05]Thanks, man.
[65:49.66]That looks like a lot of climbing going on up there.
[65:52.08]That looks like a lot.
[65:54.74]Oh, fuck.
[65:55.15]The rope is useless now.
[65:57.51]Fuck.
[65:58.81]I cooked it.
[66:00.59]Oh my god, Poke.
[66:01.91]That was a terrifying thing.
[66:04.85]I'm gonna copy Poke.
[66:05.77]I'm gonna copy Poke.
[66:08.84]Don't put marbles up your nose.
[66:13.14]Go back.
[66:14.02]Go back?
[66:15.62]Is this home alone?
[66:17.93]Is somebody gonna light the end of the rope?
[66:20.57]Oh wait, maybe you could go from that thing to the other one.
[66:23.09]You see it?
[66:23.69]Yeah, I think so.
[66:25.33]Oh, that's horrible.
[66:26.71]Yeah, I don't know how we're gonna do that.
[66:40.29]Guys, don't fall.
[66:42.53]Are you hurt?
[66:43.65]Yeah, I got bandages.
[66:45.67]I got a... Vinny, you really are giving, like, grandma energy.
[66:49.21]Don't fall!
[66:50.05]You need any food?
[66:51.56]Honey, do you need any food, sweetie?
[66:54.91]Are these blue banana berry banana goods?
[66:57.92]We're gonna find out right now.
[66:59.76]Who's for us?
[67:01.98]They're poison!
[67:03.32]Wait, no, I think they're alright.
[67:04.84]It's okay, just open your mouth and drink the water.
[67:09.43]It's raining.
[67:10.85]Yeah, it's gonna rain here once in a while, isn't it?
[67:13.59]No, no, dude.
[67:17.54]Yeah, we're not getting that briefcase on top of this thing.
[67:21.84]Why not?
[67:22.30]I got it.
[67:24.34]What the fuck just ha- I almost died!
[67:26.21]Why?!
[67:26.61]Oh, I'm poisoned.
[67:32.42]You gotta keep up.
[67:34.06]Little pup.
[67:40.49]Okay, you can't heal poison with a bandage.
[67:46.70]What?!
[67:47.48]Is he juggling?
[67:49.46]No, I'm trying to get these bananas down.
[67:52.90]Dude, these bananas are pretty good.
[67:59.58]I'm going to eat this and see if it's bad.
[68:04.17]I think I just snapped my neck on that.
[68:06.63]The green ones are poison.
[68:12.14]I ate a blue one and it was good.
[68:15.38]Guys, how are we going to get up?
[68:20.11]Maybe through the right?
[68:21.99]I have a chain launcher, like I have a hookshot from Zelda.
[68:26.07]Yeah, get us a good one.
[68:28.06]Get us a good point.
[68:28.68]Should we use it?
[68:29.72]Should we use it now?
[68:31.44]We should look at options.
[68:33.76]Alright, what's there said?
[68:36.61]Options, cross it!
[68:39.15]Banana berry does sound good.
[68:45.50]I don't know.
[68:47.82]Yeah, it's kind of fucked up over here guys, I don't know.
[68:52.50]I said we go to the right.
[68:55.90]Yeah.
[68:57.95]I'll follow poke.
[68:59.23]Oh.
[69:04.26]Remedy fungus.
[69:05.40]If anyone's poisoned, I can heal you.
[69:07.68]Nice.
[69:07.94]You think that's funny?
[69:17.30]Do you think what you just did was funny?
[69:18.72]Because that could have just ended the run.
[69:21.86]Did he throw a banana?
[69:22.84]He's trying to make you guys fall.
[69:24.97]I'm going to tattletale on him.
[69:26.59]Every time.
[69:28.51]Every time.
[69:29.85]You're not going to make any friends being a tattletale.
[69:32.17]Snitches get stitches.
[69:36.22]Yeah, next banana peel is... Don't do it.
[69:42.16]It could happen at any time.
[69:44.11]Guys.
[69:45.05]Guys.
[69:46.23]Look, come here real quick.
[69:47.23]Very important.
[69:47.89]See these things?
[69:50.08]These things right there, right?
[69:51.68]Watch this.
[69:52.76]Do not touch them.
[69:53.96]That ended my run last week.
[69:56.09]Oh my god.
[69:58.07]Yeah.
[69:58.89]Bad.
[70:00.91]So what if I throw that at someone?
[70:03.36]I don't think you can pick them up.
[70:04.40]I think you just get fucked.
[70:05.64]Oh, green is poison?
[70:09.25]Uh, it'll make you less hungry, but it will poison you for a brief while, I believe.
[70:13.03]That's what happened to me.
[70:16.58]Green is good.
[70:17.94]Have a bonus.
[70:23.62]Anyone experiencing damage or anguish?
[70:32.19]I'm experiencing emotional anguish.
[70:37.20]That I can't help with.
[70:38.60]I want to just so badly do this in real life.
[70:43.13]What, going on the rainforest alone?
[70:45.13]Oh, like right here.
[70:48.53]Oh, I think this is the way, guys.
[70:55.89]Do you want to hang out behind a waterfall, Jerma?
[70:59.76]Is that what you're saying?
[71:01.18]I need help.
[71:03.12]I need help, too.
[71:03.72]Oh, God.
[71:04.32]Grab the vine.
[71:04.90]Grab the vine.
[71:07.39]Oh, my God.
[71:09.53]This goes down so much further.
[71:10.67]Vinny, I'm dead.
[71:11.51]I'm dead.
[71:11.83]I'm dead.
[71:12.11]No, you're not.
[71:12.64]You're fine.
[71:12.96]You're fine.
[71:14.68]Okay.
[71:15.68]Help!
[71:16.84]Are you injured?
[71:17.76]I don't think so.
[71:20.23]Sir!
[71:22.47]Sir!
[71:28.17]Timmy, we have to leave.
[71:39.69]If you can hear me, Timmy, we have to leave the water park.
[71:44.20]Grab my hand or grab your hand.
[71:49.18]Yes.
[71:52.63]What does Bob say?
[71:53.85]Once you can see the wrinkles on your hands, we have to leave.
[71:58.29]How dare you?
[72:00.94]Oh.
[72:03.92]It's gone now.
[72:05.36]Alright, you happy?
[72:08.13]There's a fungus over here.
[72:11.45]The fungus can be used to make a shelf.
[72:15.66]So that's it's a really useful fungus.
[72:19.98]Also, when we build a house.
[72:22.21]Yeah, don't touch this right here.
[72:26.09]It looks pleasant.
[72:27.05]That right there, do not touch those.
[72:29.53]Okay.
[72:33.86]It's so tempting, though.
[72:34.74]They look so good.
[72:37.89]But why don't we... It tastes like purple.
[72:39.43]We should study them.
[72:41.97]I'm dying.
[72:43.03]Are you okay?
[72:44.16]I hit one.
[72:44.76]There's one more when you climb up.
[72:49.51]I'm here for y'all.
[72:50.25]Follow the bugle.
[72:51.93]I'm here for y'all.
[72:55.25]I need help.
[72:56.13]I need help.
[72:56.71]I need help.
[72:58.23]Come to the jazz.
[73:00.97]Oh, there's a big box.
[73:02.29]I wasn't here for y'all.
[73:04.32]Give me a second.
[73:04.98]I'm going to poke some of my weight.
[73:07.60]Poke is so good.
[73:09.16]Look at poke with as the team player.
[73:11.56]Seriously, here we go.
[73:13.28]Coming up.
[73:13.70]We got a rope.
[73:20.57]Was it an energy drink?
[73:22.30]Yeah.
[73:23.16]Nice.
[73:24.74]You want a rope?
[73:25.54]Who needs a sport drink?
[73:27.58]I don't know.
[73:28.63]Drink.
[73:29.13]I'll take, um, anybody want one of these remedy mushrooms?
[73:32.43]You got room in that backpack for this?
[73:34.57]I'm so glad you lost your horn.
[73:36.44]That's amazing.
[73:37.08]That's the best news all day.
[73:37.96]I threw it on purpose.
[73:38.46]I was showing you, that was the truce.
[73:40.28]I'm showing you good faith.
[73:42.66]Oh, okay.
[73:43.36]I thought you dropped it.
[73:44.43]Yeah, there was a clear lack of no.
[73:46.35]I had to throw your banana peel away for you, so I don't know about that, pal.
[73:50.55]Yeah, there was a very clear lack of like, no.
[73:53.07]So I was confused by that.
[74:00.18]Oh, is it slippery?
[74:04.45]It's too slippery.
[74:05.65]It's slippery.
[74:07.13]Oh, God.
[74:07.55]We both fell.
[74:10.31]Oh, no.
[74:10.83]Go.
[74:12.92]I'm okay.
[74:13.34]I'm alright.
[74:13.80]I'm alright.
[74:14.12]Just jump.
[74:14.40]I got you.
[74:14.78]It's okay.
[74:16.44]I didn't do anything.
[74:17.95]I watched.
[74:19.71]I can rope.
[74:23.15]Oh, it's sun raining.
[74:24.43]So you, you, okay, to rope, you have to use the mouse wheel to extend, and then you hold click into the side of a mountain.
[74:32.48]Okay.
[74:32.92]Watch your head.
[74:33.66]So, hold on to that, maybe.
[74:34.90]Watch your head, watch, there's a bomb right behind you.
[74:41.73]Apple, if anyone's hungry.
[74:43.45]Oh, I need it.
[74:44.05]I want Chinese food now.
[74:52.10]Thanks, Vinny.
[74:53.62]You know, Poker, I was thinking the same fucking thing.
[74:57.49]I might have to do Chinese food as well and then take a nap.
[75:01.37]That's painful.
[75:03.33]Thanks a lot.
[75:05.68]Uh.
[75:06.68]Yeah, I had some good Thai last night.
[75:08.76]It was good.
[75:11.00]What do you get at a Thai place, Jerma?
[75:12.90]What's your go-to?
[75:14.78]Go-to order is, um, oh my God.
[75:18.93]I like a cashew chicken.
[75:21.77]I might fall.
[75:23.54]It's so good.
[75:24.67]Here.
[75:27.02]Poke is the goat.
[75:30.68]I'm just sober today.
[75:34.31]Just today?
[75:34.93]Yeah.
[75:36.53]Yeah, cashew chicken with white rice.
[75:39.24]You get that sauce from the cashew chicken all over the white rice.
[75:42.49]It's one of the greatest things in the world.
[75:44.45]Oh, crap!
[75:44.97]What the hell?
[75:45.85]Oh, crap!
[75:47.03]Get out of here!
[75:48.14]Oh, no!
[75:49.38]Oh!
[75:51.40]God damn it!
[75:53.87]Oh.
[75:55.13]Well, I'm screwed.
[75:55.75]I'm like- I think I have a- OH NO!
[75:58.14]Who did that?
[75:58.78]What the hell?
[75:59.08]That's a good thing!
[75:59.72]That's a good thing!
[76:01.06]It's remedy!
[76:01.91]That was a good fart.
[76:02.55]Good fart.
[76:03.15]I don't know why I screamed that.
[76:04.21]Sorry.
[76:04.55]That's good.
[76:06.84]That's a good poke.
[76:07.92]Oh.
[76:08.24]Well, I should've- I should've smoked it.
[76:10.10]I'm still poisoned.
[76:11.77]Wait, that was a good fart?
[76:13.17]I thought so.
[76:13.97]It was a remedy mushroom.
[76:15.62]It didn't work.
[76:15.94]Finny, hold on.
[76:16.74]Okay, Finny, can I just say, um, what you could have said is, hey, here comes a remedy for poison instead of screaming, remedy!
[76:26.93]No, shit, this is poison!
[76:29.55]God damn it!
[76:29.81]Why do you have to walk it through it?
[76:31.38]I don't know.
[76:31.98]I'm confused.
[76:33.44]We're not getting that.
[76:34.48]Is that possible?
[76:40.17]Yeah, I wouldn't.
[76:41.25]I don't know.
[76:41.71]That's scary.
[76:43.46]Yeah, I don't think so either.
[76:45.67]He wants to do it though, don't you?
[76:47.43]If I had more stamina, I'd do it, but I'm not doing it.
[76:50.03]What about the lunchbox?
[76:53.57]Oh, let's get out of here.
[76:54.59]It's too wet.
[76:55.76]Actually, no.
[76:57.06]You want a bite?
[76:58.92]No, no, no.
[77:00.14]My food's low.
[77:00.78]I just poisoned it.
[77:02.44]My food is so low.
[77:05.65]This sucks, actually.
[77:06.59]I don't know.
[77:08.39]No, it doesn't.
[77:14.73]You know what?
[77:15.75]I'm gonna do it.
[77:18.62]Thank you.
[77:18.86]You're gonna jump?
[77:20.48]No, I got an idea, fellas.
[77:23.85]Oh, shit.
[77:25.95]I'm gonna take a hit from the lunchbox.
[77:32.46]I think I'm on fi- Are you okay?
[77:33.98]I'm falling asleep.
[77:37.34]Way to go.
[77:37.84]Wait, guys, he's falling.
[77:39.57]I actually can't control my character.
[77:40.93]I only have one of these.
[77:41.95]I dropped all my items.
[77:44.33]This is a little scary because the stamina is still being used.
[77:50.76]Oh, this is freaky.
[77:52.30]Careful.
[77:54.02]There's enough, but it kind of sucks a little bit.
[77:56.08]Be careful, guys.
[77:57.61]Oh, do not run jump it.
[77:58.65]Do not run jump it.
[77:59.47]Have full stamina and eat.
[78:02.21]Do not run jump it.
[78:04.95]Help!
[78:08.26]What are you doing with that?
[78:14.10]You're doing a great job.
[78:16.26]Why am I not going anywhere?
[78:21.01]You go.
[78:24.63]Dude, voice flop, dance flop.
[78:27.11]I know.
[78:27.77]If it doesn't have a dance in it, it's not worth it.
[78:30.42]Did you see that Divas and Butthead are now in Call of Duty?
[78:34.02]Like, Call of Duty's trying real hard to be Fortnite these days.
[78:37.08]It's kind of amazing.
[78:38.43]What do you mean they're in Call of Duty?
[78:39.60]You should just load up Call of Duty one day and just look at all the skins.
[78:42.20]I know.
[78:43.50]It would amaze you.
[78:45.90]Dude, I get Call of Duty from Activision every year and I make fun of it every year and they still give me copies.
[78:52.11]It's nuts.
[78:53.85]I bought weed skins.
[78:55.44]That was fun.
[78:57.28]Dude, they have the most insane skins that just...
[79:02.36]Cover up your screen.
[79:03.82]I'll play Call of Duty with you, Poke.
[79:06.81]Oh no!
[79:07.37]I haven't played in a long time.
[79:09.37]Oh god, guys!
[79:10.21]Goodbye!
[79:12.86]I would not go up the chain.
[79:15.52]Uh oh.
[79:16.94]I'm good.
[79:18.25]I can pull people up here.
[79:20.93]Alright.
[79:21.97]If we all play Call of Duty, it'd be funny.
[79:24.03]Oh, you gotta get me.
[79:24.86]Come to me.
[79:26.26]Got you.
[79:28.74]Ow.
[79:30.88]Do you guys think they'll ever put the three Stooges in Fortnite and they're black and white and you can switch between the three?
[79:36.99]Guys, I'm falling asleep.
[79:37.91]Guys, I'm falling asleep.
[79:39.59]Oh, no!
[79:40.28]The rain makes it bad.
[79:41.38]The rain makes it bad.
[79:42.62]Just stay right here.
[79:44.26]I'm schlipping.
[79:45.08]I'm schlipping.
[79:46.00]Is Ster dead?
[79:46.79]Just come up.
[79:47.69]Oh, he's... Oh, God.
[79:50.47]What happened to Ster?
[79:51.15]I'm alright.
[79:51.53]I think Ster's dead.
[79:53.60]Ster said he was falling asleep.
[79:58.44]Okay, the way you were holding that Ster was weird.
[80:02.08]I'm coming up.
[80:02.66]I think you guys got it.
[80:04.82]How do I look in my own backpack?
[80:08.33]I look up and I see Ster.
[80:12.39]Yeah, I'm probably gonna need to eat.
[80:14.07]Hang on.
[80:14.63]I'm gonna drop you this right here.
[80:16.87]Ready?
[80:17.87]Yeah.
[80:20.60]Oh, fuck.
[80:24.20]Grab my hand.
[80:25.16]Grab my hand.
[80:26.80]Grab my hand.
[80:30.62]I'm good over here.
[80:31.42]I'm good over here.
[80:32.12]You're good.
[80:32.92]There's a bunch of boxes up here, too.
[80:35.99]Oh, my God.
[80:36.79]That was just weird.
[80:37.59]I'm sorry, guys, but it was fucking weird.
[80:44.72]Oh, my virtual one is.
[80:46.72]Oh.
[80:49.12]Dude, look at this.
[80:49.76]We made it.
[80:51.27]We're good.
[80:52.97]We did it.
[80:53.37]There's bees.
[80:56.13]Oh, yeah.
[80:56.51]Don't fuck with that.
[80:57.94]Bomb.
[80:59.30]Bees.
[80:59.74]Can you crouch it?
[81:00.84]Dope.
[81:03.50]Careful, careful.
[81:04.39]No!
[81:06.65]Bob!
[81:07.75]Bees!
[81:09.89]I'm colorblind, I didn't see it.
[81:12.10]That was a comedy moment.
[81:14.60]Oh!
[81:14.98]Dude!
[81:15.82]Oh!
[81:19.27]No!
[81:19.35]That's just like a home alone.
[81:21.05]He said, like, Marv.
[81:23.77]What happened to him?
[81:26.17]He's gone.
[81:26.87]He's gone.
[81:29.27]Is he dead?
[81:29.51]He fell off the side.
[81:31.12]He had two trapped suitcases.
[81:33.24]That sucks.
[81:36.28]Can we revive him?
[81:38.20]Yeah.
[81:39.03]Next checkpoint, I guess.
[81:42.17]What the hell?
[81:46.47]Oh, no.
[81:48.70]I laughed at it, too.
[81:50.14]It was just he bounced over there.
[81:51.50]It was crazy.
[81:54.59]I didn't expect part two.
[81:56.31]No, I didn't either.
[81:57.71]He must have gone far because this ghost isn't even here.
[82:03.82]What happened?
[82:14.67]What happened?
[82:15.59]I'm still alive.
[82:16.51]I'm still alive.
[82:17.27]Just drink everything.
[82:18.03]I'll live.
[82:18.65]I'll live.

[83:14.81]Is that what happened?
[83:15.45]That was funny.
[83:16.35]No, he just clumsily walked.
[83:17.97]No, that's not true.
[83:19.05]Ster doesn't know what's going on.
[83:20.99]Ster is... making up shit.
[83:24.48]Hey, can you check my backpack real quick?
[83:27.94]Yeah, come up here and I'll do it.
[83:30.42]Okay, it wasn't the ghost that scared me.
[83:33.49]I saw him.
[83:34.29]I was like, oh, there's Poke up there.
[83:36.13]I thought he could push me.
[83:38.67]It was a little startling, but I thought he could move me, and I thought he was pushing me off, so I freaked out.
[83:44.94]Now, I have a rope cannon.
[83:46.60]I'm gonna grab one out of the backpack.
[83:50.47]Okay, I have one rope.
[83:52.97]Rope is good.
[83:54.51]I have a shelf mushroom, and I have a rope cannon, so we might... We can shoot rope, but we gotta get up there.
[84:03.46]Oh!
[84:05.54]He's alive though.
[84:08.34]I'm alive.
[84:09.00]How do I be a ghost?

[84:31.86]How did he fly into my face and scream in my face?
[84:34.69]I can't do that.
[84:35.71]I found rope.
[84:36.39]I found... I'm gonna... I shot rope.
[84:38.15]I'm coming up.
[84:40.48]Okay, I can drop rope.

[87:25.48]Good choice.
[87:27.15]Yeah, Blade Runner.
[87:28.25]That's a good one.
[87:30.87]Careful, Vinny.
[87:31.97]You're out of stamina points.
[87:34.66]Okay.
[87:35.86]Okay, I'm here.
[87:37.30]Ster, I might be able to help you up, but it's a tough climb.
[87:40.29]This one's a tough climb.
[87:44.05]Oh, I'm about that.
[87:45.39]I'm about that.
[87:47.06]Oh, yeah.
[87:48.74]You guys are almost there.
[87:49.54]Perfect.

[88:01.90]That computer I have of you on my computer, like that computer I made yesterday of the fake picture of you leaking your thing, like a body part.
[88:10.63]A body part.
[88:12.73]Oh, what does that do?
[88:15.08]You climb infinitely for a short while, then you crash.
[88:17.34]Go climb, climb, climb, climb.
[88:19.96]Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[88:27.86]I'm crashing.
[88:29.62]Oh, it's raining, and this is slippery.
[88:31.88]I'm raining, and this is slippery.
[88:34.69]I'm raining.
[88:41.39]Dude, I think you're gonna be alright.
[88:42.86]You should make out pretty good from this.
[88:46.81]We're gonna make out?
[88:48.41]No, I'm just saying.
[88:49.65]You should be fine.
[88:50.72]The rain will let up.
[88:52.10]I will do some work behind the scenes.
[88:55.07]Is Vinny dead?
[88:55.47]Thanks, Grandfather.
[88:56.21]No, I created a shelf.
[89:01.09]And there you go.
[89:02.39]Great-grandfather clearing the water coming from the sky.
[89:06.24]And I don't even get a thank you from my little shit grandson.
[89:10.27]Thank you, grandpappy.
[89:14.67]By the way, you only get one, so if you ask for like a lottery win later, it ain't going to happen.
[89:20.74]Denise racing me.
[89:22.66]I don't know if you could see it.
[89:24.88]You guys, there's a big treasure, a big suitcase over there.
[89:27.61]Why are you talking to the dead people over me?
[89:29.89]I don't know.
[89:30.33]I forgot.
[89:32.69]What is he going to do?
[89:35.43]Scorch Berry.

[89:47.82]Put me out.
[89:48.34]Okay, Rain's putting me out, I think.
[89:53.36]I brought that rain back.
[89:55.61]I brought it back.
[89:57.39]Coming out of the rock.
[89:58.37]You were such a little fucker, even when I was alive.
[90:02.44]You fucking shithead.
[90:03.80]You shall deal with the rain.
[90:07.02]You gotta come out of the rock and scream.
[90:10.87]I think this is a good spot here, sir, yeah.
[90:13.29]Oh, there's spikes here.
[90:15.00]We can get up.
[90:18.52]Lend me yours.

[90:25.86]Help.
[90:25.98]Help.
[90:31.64]Help.
[90:31.76]I see maybe a good mushroom over here.
[90:34.35]I want to grab it.
[90:35.09]It's a shelf shroom.
[90:36.17]These are good.
[90:39.90]That's not going to explode?
[90:42.04]No, this is going to create a shelf.
[90:45.58]This can save us.
[90:50.30]I'm racing you.
[90:58.29]Yes.
[90:59.01]Split up.
[91:00.49]Split up from them.
[91:03.22]Make sure you do it all by yourself.
[91:05.58]You can do it by yourself.
[91:07.08]Sir, I don't think we could have split up, pal.
[91:08.94]No, don't listen to him.
[91:10.36]No, I think I can do it by myself.
[91:12.51]Yeah, of course you can.
[91:13.51]You're stronger.
[91:13.97]I'm feeling a strange confidence.
[91:16.19]Wow, wearing this ring isn't bad at all.
[91:18.31]I think I could handle it.
[91:19.77]Your arms are bigger, your legs are stronger.
[91:21.66]Leave him, he's weak.
[91:24.44]You can do it alone.
[91:25.56]No, I've done it.
[91:29.41]Like, it's here.
[91:29.97]I can tell.
[91:30.93]Up there.
[91:32.15]Thank you.
[91:32.55]For the confidence, Grandpa.
[91:34.31]Boo!
[91:36.56]Shit.
[91:38.54]I... Fuck.
[91:39.70]You know what he says about you behind your back, don't you?
[91:43.26]I know.
[91:44.16]I hate him.
[91:45.46]Leave him.
[91:46.36]Leave him.
[91:47.60]The food.
[91:49.80]The can of beans you have in your backpack.
[91:51.69]Don't give him any.
[91:56.69]Oh!
[91:57.05]Stern, did you hear what Jerbo was saying about cans of beans?
[92:01.02]Uh, he was talking to me about eating your intestines.
[92:03.98]Oh, cool.
[92:05.06]We're back, baby!
[92:06.40]Let's go!
[92:07.61]The exact length of the small intestines, it was detailed.
[92:15.23]Y'all save me.
[92:16.03]Thank you.
[92:18.24]Let's cook.
[92:23.44]Oh, it's time to cook.
[92:27.15]What else should we cook?
[92:28.87]We got another backpack.
[92:31.25]I don't want another backpack.
[92:40.81]So do we get a special?
[92:42.71]Do we get a special item from this thing like last time or no?
[92:46.10]Oh, okay.
[92:47.82]Oh, what?
[92:54.67]I don't know what anything does.
[92:57.53]Are you bleeding?
[92:58.03]No, it's the sports drink.
[93:00.33]Can you cook your backpack?
[93:02.60]Oh, it gives you energy?
[93:03.60]Oh, no.
[93:06.34]You can.
[93:06.96]It was like water.
[93:09.40]I don't know.
[93:11.53]Oh, the water one.
[93:12.27]Yeah, I don't know.
[93:13.33]I don't know.
[93:13.67]I don't know.
[93:15.76]It's snowy.
[93:18.19]Yeah.
[93:19.31]I haven't seen this biome, so I don't know.
[93:21.41]Poke, have you ever completed this?
[93:24.48]Yes, I did.
[93:27.02]He's lying.
[93:28.10]You're the expedition leader.
[93:30.60]Solo or with a group?
[93:31.95]Box.
[93:32.73]Box.
[93:33.49]With three people total.
[93:37.93]I was dead most of the time.
[93:39.00]Box alert.
[93:39.70]Box.
[93:40.46]Box.
[93:41.20]Box.
[93:41.96]Ow.
[93:42.04]Box.
[93:43.32]Box.
[93:47.86]Are you- No, I'm kidding.
[93:49.70]Did you just die?
[93:50.30]Yeah, I'm alright.
[93:54.37]Oh, shit.
[93:55.43]Fox.
[93:56.09]No!
[93:56.75]Oooh, my fingers!
[94:00.30]I wouldn't recommend- Snowstorm, get a crevice!
[94:01.92]Get a crevice!
[94:03.14]Wait, a crevice?
[94:03.76]Get a crevice!
[94:05.77]Oh, you don't wanna get winded.
[94:07.55]Oh god, he's right!
[94:09.33]You get, like, snow, and then, uh- Hello, grandfather.
[94:13.48]Get off the fuck outta here.
[94:16.02]Get off of me.
[94:25.09]I was choking my grandson to death.
[94:39.75]Oh.
[94:58.20]Watch out, the winds might be picking up here.
[95:00.82]Uh-huh.
[95:01.86]I feel like the wind's coming.
[95:02.78]Crevice?
[95:03.26]Yeah, my knee's starting to hurt.
[95:09.16]It's here!
[95:09.84]Crevice.
[95:14.04]Put our bodies together for warmth.
[95:17.65]I'm in bad shape, Bellus.
[95:29.47]We good?
[95:31.09]Yeah.
[95:31.23]What'd you get in there?
[95:32.99]I got a chain launcher and heat pack.
[95:39.76]Come with you, Poke.
[95:47.05]I'm lost.
[95:47.25]Spam jump.
[95:47.71]Spam jump on this.
[95:48.81]Help me.
[95:51.38]Thank you.
[95:52.82]I just love how you can spam space a lot of times.
[95:55.16]It's kind of weird.
[95:55.74]Dude, you just saved me.
[95:56.71]We can huddle for warmth.
[95:58.83]You'll lose your reserve stamina if you spam space, but it works here.
[96:01.99]Nice.
[96:04.42]I hear the wind.
[96:07.18]I can't make it.
[96:07.82]Just run.
[96:08.38]Get to the crevice.
[96:09.22]That's not... That was it, right?
[96:10.12]Hey, sir?
[96:13.83]Yeah.
[96:13.95]Yeah.
[96:14.07]I'm getting a gun.
[96:19.16]I'm at the bomb.
[96:19.52]Sir's ahead of us.
[96:20.30]What?
[96:20.68]Oh, crevice.
[96:22.62]Yeah, we didn't even really need to climb back.
[96:35.43]Oh, as long as something can break the wind?
[96:37.21]Okay.
[96:42.28]Guys, I'm sprinting to the top.
[96:46.06]I really wish I didn't take damage.
[96:48.08]Half of my stamina is totally gone.
[96:50.22]Let's find a heal for him first before we adventure.
[96:52.73]Guys, help!
[96:55.05]Where?
[96:55.41]You okay?
[96:56.47]I can't get up.
[96:57.67]I got you to climb up.
[96:58.57]I'm done with all of you.
[97:02.51]Feel my age.
[97:03.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:05.28]Maybe not that much.
[97:06.94]I'm kind of joking.
[97:07.84]You're in the pit.
[97:09.20]You're in the pit.
[97:09.66]Yeah, Vinny needed uppies.
[97:12.00]Ster's remedy mushroom.
[97:13.22]Ster, can you throw that remedy mushroom at me?
[97:16.65]Uh, take it on my backpack.
[97:18.49]Okay.
[97:19.75]Wind.
[97:21.19]Oh!
[97:22.27]That's a good thing!
[97:23.01]That's so scary!
[97:23.90]Oh my god, why is it so scary?
[97:25.70]You can't, like, shoot someone in the chest and say, it's a good thing.
[97:29.74]Good thing?
[97:32.32]You just, like, don't get it yet.
[97:37.84]Oh, music.

[99:43.22]You're welcome.
[99:44.29]We have to go up, Vinny.
[99:47.27]Okay, sir.
[99:48.02]I'm fucking trying, okay?
[99:50.02]Vinny, this story's for you and not them.
[99:54.25]When I was young, I was very young.
[99:56.57]You peed on your sock?
[99:57.44]It was really cold outside in New Jersey.
[100:00.12]There was the blizzard in 96.
[100:02.10]You know this.
[100:03.14]I was alive and well for that, sure.
[100:06.19]That's what it was.
[100:07.17]I was six years old then.
[100:08.25]It was really cold outside and I thought to myself, oh, I know it's warm.
[100:12.04]Piss.
[100:12.76]So I just pissed my pants.
[100:14.06]And then my pants were all wet and I said, hey guys, I have to go.
[100:19.39]Because I was hanging out with friends.
[100:20.75]You were hanging out with friends?
[100:21.61]They weren't your friends after that or what happened?
[100:25.79]Uh, they didn't know.
[100:27.55]Oh, good.
[100:28.11]Yeah, they did.
[100:28.64]It was like not too far from my house.
[100:30.10]Yes, they did.
[100:30.76]What were you wearing?
[100:31.22]No, they didn't.
[100:31.78]No, they didn't.
[100:32.22]Were you wearing like a diaper?
[100:33.76]Well, you have layers.
[100:35.46]Oh, shit.
[100:35.90]Go back.
[100:36.66]Dude, you can't.
[100:37.72]Oh!

[100:47.95]What's your heat at?
[100:48.57]I'm dying.
[100:49.35]I'm dying.
[100:50.67]Mini, you up?
[100:51.39]Hey, piss your pants.
[100:52.41]Piss your pants.

[101:08.36]Oh, there's a way up here.
[101:09.46]Me and Pope climbing.
[101:11.12]I'll go with this, sir.
[101:12.64]Roger that.
[101:13.26]Roger that.
[101:13.68]On the ice biome, you could stand safe a little bit.
[101:15.96]It's kind of weird.
[101:17.20]But you lose all your reserve pins.
[101:19.89]Thank you.
[101:29.42]Are you good?
[101:30.96]Yeah.
[101:32.22]I got you if you can get up here.
[101:38.10]It's slippery.
[101:41.62]Oh, we need a crevice.
[101:44.21]I found a semi crevice.
[101:48.97]This isn't good enough.
[101:50.64]This is not good enough.
[101:53.28]This is bad.
[101:56.52]This is bad.
[101:58.20]What about here?
[101:58.65]What about here?
[101:59.47]Can we sit right here?
[102:00.37]No, we're dead.
[102:02.25]What if we huddle?
[102:02.81]What if we huddle?
[102:03.37]Huddle, huddle, huddle.
[102:06.27]It's working.
[102:10.25]Alright.
[102:16.47]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[102:18.14]What have these guys accomplished?
[102:20.92]We huddled.
[102:21.98]We got closer.
[102:25.03]Me and Poke are gonna kill these kids.
[102:33.70]Many, many apples.
[102:38.66]Apples up there?
[102:40.29]Nice.
[102:42.51]Oh yeah, that's good.
[102:43.71]That's good shit right there.

[104:10.78]There's still apples on that tree.
[104:15.22]Uh oh, snow!

[104:32.33]We're good, I got like three apples if anyone's hungry.
[104:35.40]I'm gonna get this last apple.
[104:39.58]I got space for it.
[104:42.45]Goddamn space.
[104:45.75]The higher we climb, the older Jerma gets.
[104:50.50]I thought he was doing a Matthew McConaughey and Interstellar impression.
[104:55.13]Just picking apples, that's all I'm doing.
[104:59.03]I think right is the way.

[105:34.94]Ster, you're going to get us both killed.
[105:40.07]I don't know.
[105:40.41]It's kind of cute in here.
[105:42.31]It is nice in here.
[105:44.51]I'm surprised you're following me after saying I'm going to get you killed.
[105:47.72]Is there an outlet there or?
[105:50.34]Uh, there's some varicium.
[105:52.87]If anyone has the axe for it.
[105:56.23]Shut up.
[106:02.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[106:13.83]That thing's actually huge.
[106:15.15]It's got a skeleton face.
[106:21.90]It has a gun.
[106:23.08]It has a gun!
[106:23.56]It has a gun!
[106:30.37]Guys, guys, Dremel was right!
[106:34.44]Dremel was right!
[106:34.80]Those are my last words.
[106:37.52]Hey, it was just a joke.
[106:39.64]We're fine.
[106:40.22]Don't freak out.
[106:41.25]Ster told me to do a bit for the YouTube video.
[106:54.26]Where are you?
[106:58.32]You can't go higher?
[107:00.55]I hope that's not the first reaction.
[107:02.09]Like you get a call, stirs dead and you just start laughing.
[107:06.69]Dude, that was funny.
[107:07.88]Come on.
[107:08.36]This looks like we're not going to make this.
[107:11.90]Poke, we need you.
[107:13.78]I'm not doing that.
[107:14.80]I'm not doing that.
[107:15.63]Yeah, like what?
[107:17.99]We need a hand, Poke.
[107:19.71]It's no wonder Vinny died.
[107:20.81]He probably fell right there.
[107:21.97]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[107:27.96]Nice.
[107:34.38]There you go.
[107:38.11]There's a dog.
[107:40.85]This is the biggest dog in peak.
[107:44.43]So yeah, I died guys.
[107:45.47]That sucked.
[107:46.25]I'm sorry I died.
[107:47.18]I had a lot of good stuff on me too.
[107:49.32]It was this fucking chain.
[107:50.78]I misjudged the jump.
[107:52.14]I'm sorry you're dead.
[107:53.26]You don't need to apologize for being dead.
[107:55.64]Ster, we have to move.
[107:56.61]I think the thing is going to start blasting soon.
[108:01.95]Dude, don't do that.
[108:03.93]I don't know where to climb to.
[108:05.07]Where's Poke?
[108:06.53]Poke?
[108:08.18]Crevice.
[108:09.32]Crevice.
[108:09.80]Crevice.
[108:11.56]This is working.
[108:13.42]We can go this way.
[108:17.09]That way.
[108:19.39]You're probably wondering how I got here.
[108:21.68]Well... Well?
[108:26.64]It's a long story.
[108:30.61]I was seeing...
[108:34.49]There's a monster!
[108:40.42]Dude, that monster had a gun.
[108:45.17]Help me!
[108:45.81]Don't let me die!
[108:56.29]Help me!
[108:57.81]Help!
[108:59.31]HELP!
[108:59.95]Oh, you, oh wait, oh, Poke, Poke, you gotta use the, um, mouse wheel forward.
[109:06.86]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[109:09.65]Hey, stop pushing me, that's my spot!
[109:11.17]No, it's my spot, I need to live, not you.
[109:13.37]What happened to my, whoa!
[109:21.82]Poke wants to see us dead.
[109:26.27]He is not a team player.
[109:27.47]Here, here, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[109:29.18]Oh, we got, we got apps.
[109:30.08]We got apples.
[109:31.12]Did he go AFK?
[109:34.83]Oh yeah, there he is.
[109:35.91]There he is.
[109:36.45]He's right here.
[109:37.11]Poke went to pee for a minute.
[109:38.29]I watched him as a ghost.
[109:40.09]Oh, OK.
[109:42.16]Well, we have plenty of food here.
[109:43.68]I don't know.
[109:44.46]I'm just being, I feel like I'm being judged by Vinny.
[109:47.02]Ooh, hot spring.
[109:50.52]Yeah, kind of.
[109:51.67]There's another apple up there.
[109:56.55]Hot spring?
[109:58.56]Oh, I think it is a hot spring.
[110:02.83]Oh, dude.
[110:04.17]Oh, wait, stay in it during this.
[110:05.23]You're good.
[110:06.47]Dude, being in a hot tub when it's snowing out, dude, that's the fucking best.
[110:11.67]Yeah.
[110:12.03]These are beavers.
[110:13.47]That's some real Airbnb behavior.
[110:16.74]Yeah, I go under the water until I can't, like, think straight.
[110:23.68]Alright, I think... It hurts.
[110:26.13]I think we go through that hole right there.
[110:30.62]You gotta save Vinny.
[110:32.03]I'm just gonna judge you.
[110:35.31]Silently judging.
[110:37.09]Vinny, I confided my piss story in you.
[110:42.98]You... Yeah, me and, um... No one else.
[110:46.04]You're right.
[110:46.92]No one heard that.
[110:49.06]Oh, God.
[110:52.89]Stero, I'm gonna tell you a story.
[110:54.51]I'm gonna tell you a story.
[110:55.83]When I was in first grade... He's right there.
[110:58.42]I don't know who you're talking about.
[110:59.74]When I was in first grade, I had a bloody nose, and I blew a blood bubble out of my nose in my chat, sorry, in my class.
[111:09.12]The power of Christ compels you!
[111:13.79]The power of Christ compels you!
[111:15.71]The power of Christ compels you!
[111:22.70]I took care of that.
[111:23.52]There was a... I don't know if you noticed, sir.
[111:24.98]There was like a fucking thing next to your head.
[111:27.11]It was like a ghost or something.
[111:27.99]He was telling me a story about his childhood.
[111:30.69]And if we can resolve his past traumas, he'll stop being a ghost.
[111:34.82]Oh.
[111:35.42]But also, I guess, God.
[111:40.19]Guys, you might want to see this.

[113:46.37]They act like they weren't hindering you.
[113:50.35]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[113:53.84]He just keeps climbing.
[113:54.76]Where did you go?
[113:55.32]We were screaming in Vinny's face.
[113:58.28]That's true.
[114:05.11]Here.
[114:08.05]Pick that up before it falls.
[114:12.42]I got it.
[114:20.77]I like this angle.

[114:51.66]Ooh, cold!
[114:52.56]Ooh, cold!

[114:53.99]Cold, cold, cold!
[114:55.15]Ow!
[114:55.45]Owie!
[114:56.43]Ow!
[114:58.73]Ow!
[115:01.21]You're not even taking damage.
[115:03.09]It can be tough alone, but if you have the tech, if you got the skill, Poke, and I know you do, you can, yeah, I think go for it.
[115:09.90]Alright, Poke, we're right behind you.
[115:12.84]Poke's trying to out-climb us.
[115:14.18]I ain't having it.
[115:15.28]I'll race you guys up here.
[115:16.77]Dude, we're the two climbing streamers right now.
[115:19.47]This is ridiculous.
[115:22.04]You're top 200 in the world in White Knuckle.
[115:26.38]And how are you not up there already?
[115:28.73]Wait, are you guys really that good at White Knuckle?
[115:30.65]He is.
[115:32.39]Wow.
[115:34.05]I'm 67.
[115:34.69]He keeps saying top 200 and it's disrespecting me.
[115:37.66]Did you actually get higher?
[115:40.30]I'm higher on the hard mode.
[115:42.10]Oh my god.
[115:45.97]You guys need fruit?
[115:46.39]I can throw some.
[115:47.59]I think we're alright.
[115:49.01]I think so.
[115:49.65]Ster, where are you?
[115:50.65]What is your plan here?
[115:52.73]I don't know.
[115:53.29]I want to see if I can get to the top of this tree.
[115:56.36]I don't.
[115:57.30]I ain't doing that.
[115:58.30]I think we can go this way.
[116:02.71]Did that work?
[116:12.70]No.
[116:15.20]I think we got to keep going around.
[116:22.43]I think we had to go.
[116:23.35]Looks like you can go up there, but you kind of can't.
[116:28.62]Hope got up there somehow.
[116:30.18]I feel stuck.
[116:31.91]Hold on, what about around here?
[116:33.59]Yeah, I think it's up there.
[116:36.91]I'm going to try this way.
[116:39.23]Oh my God.
[116:40.40]I would love to not fall all the way.
[116:45.42]That'd be great.
[116:47.85]Oh, that sucks.
[116:51.57]Why'd you take so much damage?
[116:53.87]This is bad man.
[116:54.81]I'm going this way instead.
[117:00.70]Guys, poke is.
[117:02.32]Poke is dying.
[117:03.82]We're coming.
[117:05.84]You can be revived.
[117:06.72]I don't know where he is.
[117:15.39]Yeah, what about many?
[117:16.87]Where is he?
[117:17.45]OK, we're coming.
[117:21.40]What a helpful ghost.
[117:24.08]Oh, suddenly Poke needs our help?
[117:25.96]I say we throw him off.
[117:28.98]He hasn't been helping us.
[117:30.99]Actually, he has been helping me the entire time.
[117:36.95]He's been helping himself.
[117:40.00]Poke?
[117:43.02]Oh, I see him.
[117:43.86]He's right there.
[117:46.34]Yeah, here.
[117:47.06]He's here.

[118:34.65]We're going up this way.
[118:35.35]We're going back.
[118:37.51]We are the two climbing streamers here.
[118:39.30]We're going to have to show the skill here.
[118:40.62]Around this corner and up.
[118:45.47]There's another fruit in there.
[118:47.10]Now, Sturford has not died yet, so that's kind of telling.
[118:51.59]How do I put stuff in a backpack?
[118:56.36]How do you put stuff in your backpack?
[118:58.14]What?
[118:59.40]How do I put stuff in my backpack?
[119:01.34]You can put your backpack down.
[119:03.07]Drop the bag.
[119:04.51]And then... You gotta drop the bag and put it in.
[119:07.93]Thanks.
[119:08.81]I appreciate the help.
[119:15.64]Oh, snow's here.
[119:17.60]Snow's here.
[119:24.65]Why can I not fucking figure this out?
[119:31.46]How do I pick it back up?
[119:34.48]Ghost, can you help him?
[119:35.82]How do I pick the backpack up?
[119:39.19]I'm looking.
[119:40.03]Oh, okay.
[119:40.41]I got it.
[119:41.59]And then boom!
[119:47.57]Almost.
[119:49.75]This area is... Ster peed his pants when he was in grade school.
[119:54.52]Back away.
[119:55.60]Back away.
[119:57.30]Okay, I heard that.
[120:02.35]Vile, demonic presences.
[120:04.55]Ster, I need you to grab me.
[120:07.62]You're up.
[120:10.42]Watch out for this ice.
[120:12.60]Makes you cold.
[120:15.05]It's like the beach that makes you old.
[120:19.38]Okay, good.
[120:21.78]Watch out.
[120:22.14]I think we're just going to do a full rotation here.
[120:24.24]Do a roto.
[120:25.40]I agree.
[120:28.47]Me and you, until the end.
[120:30.45]That sounds good to me.
[120:31.27]Hey, hey guys, guys.
[120:32.35]I'm a friendly ghost with some advice.
[120:34.23]You that crouch and jump on his head, then jump.
[120:39.12]Sound like a Banjo-Kazooie character.
[120:40.68]Whoa, that worked.
[120:44.79]Alright, I'm thinking up here.
[120:45.45]I don't want to beat this by cheating.
[120:48.43]It's not a cheat, it's actually intended mechanics.
[120:51.18]Oh boy, I hope I have enough power to get the fuck up there.
[120:54.18]I do.
[120:54.62]I'm gonna need to give you a hand probably though.
[120:56.15]Hands on me.
[120:56.91]Put your hands on me.
[120:58.31]I did.
[120:58.89]Look at this.
[121:01.01]I think we made it.
[121:01.57]Good work.
[121:04.18]Uh, I mean not quite.
[121:05.96]Oh, I see the, uh, no, I see the campfire way over there in the distance.
[121:09.24]Let's do it.
[121:09.87]Do you see it?
[121:11.37]I don't think my, um, draw distance is as far as yours.
[121:14.73]You see my marker?
[121:15.75]Oh, okay.
[121:16.21]Well, let's move.
[121:17.00]It's right over that hill.
[121:17.86]Let's move.
[121:19.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:20.52]Just going right through here looked good.
[121:24.07]I like that.
[121:29.19]Then we might get a big gust of... Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster.
[121:45.44]I'm going all the way down.
[121:47.82]Oh my God, see you at the top.
[121:52.95]I need to eat something from my backpack.
[121:57.81]They're separated.
[121:59.51]The offspring was right.
[122:04.80]Wait, I don't want to do that.
[122:09.09]Hold on.
[122:10.25]Hold on, I. I just wait.
[122:15.29]Where are you?
[122:17.21]On the other side where you fell.
[122:20.04]Okay.
[122:20.78]Can you see me?
[122:21.96]Coming.
[122:25.36]JJ.
[122:26.14]Stop.
[122:27.60]Follow the sound of my voice.
[122:29.29]I'm going to get banana.
[122:30.83]Yeah, I'm over here.
[122:32.67]We got it.
[122:33.45]We beat it.
[122:34.19]Did we do it?
[122:35.57]Yeah, it's up the hill.
[122:36.63]You see?
[122:38.28]Dude, look at that.
[122:39.74]Here, take my hand.
[122:40.72]Take my hand.
[122:41.90]This climb's bad right here.
[122:43.68]I can't reach from here.
[122:47.89]I'm so glad I was furthest away from that.
[122:53.45]Can you do hot cross buns?
[122:55.90]Well, I don't know what that is.
[122:56.74]What is that?
[122:58.45]Okay.
[122:58.81]You just got a fucking gift.
[123:00.95]Sing it.
[123:01.85]What does that mean?
[123:10.86]It goes.
[123:13.53]Three blind mice.
[123:15.11]OK, how do you get to how old you are?
[123:17.93]Like what 4050 and you don't hear hot cross buns and you're doing flute noises.
[123:26.10]Do we gotta get up there before the wind starts?
[123:28.22]It's gonna happen any second now.
[123:31.30]I think it's over because we got high enough.
[123:34.96]Don't look down.
[123:36.64]Is this the peak?
[123:40.87]We peaked.
[123:42.37]Whoa!
[123:43.85]I summon you.
[123:44.97]Do my bidding.
[123:46.44]That's awesome.
[123:47.72]You guys did a great job.
[123:49.14]Look what I got for you.
[123:52.02]Is this my rope?
[123:54.53]It's a blood bubble.
[123:56.13]Congratulations.
[123:56.89]It's your swag bag.
[123:58.15]Thanks for getting to the top of the peak mountain.
[124:02.21]You're gonna see in there a branded lollipop.
[124:06.24]Peak.
[124:06.82]It's got peak on it.
[124:07.66]Branded trail mix.
[124:09.84]Swag bag.
[124:10.90]Enjoy the swag bag.
[124:12.64]Gamer pops.
[124:16.29]Thank you.
[124:17.27]There's only two... ...shmallows.
[124:21.00]Do you guys... Do you guys... Who ate the other ones?
[124:25.22]Who need bandage?
[124:27.55]I think... Who wants food?
[124:29.05]Who needs food?
[124:30.31]Do you guys need food?
[124:31.33]Or are you...
[124:32.86]You saved our lives.
[124:33.76]You can take it.
[124:34.72]No, you definitely take it.
[124:35.80]You definitely take it.
[124:37.24]I'm dead weight for sure.
[124:40.40]I'm eating banana right now.
[124:41.43]I'll find more food.
[124:42.11]Oh, okay.
[124:42.33]We'll find food.
[124:43.01]Yeah, we'll find more food.
[124:44.77]You're going to get banana in real life?
[124:46.17]That doesn't carry over.
[124:47.27]I'll take this.
[124:53.12]No, but with enough potassium, you can get better at video games.
[124:56.80]I actually do have to pee in real life.
[124:59.03]Can I just run away for a minute?
[125:02.18]I was gonna leave you guys.
[125:03.99]Yeah, that's fine.
[125:05.61]Yeah, you'll see.
[125:06.01]You'll all see.
[125:06.43]June 6th.
[125:08.33]So, I was in class, and, like, I had a bloody nose, but then I had, like, a booger.
[125:14.62]I can't mute, so I'm just leaving.
[125:15.82]I'll be right back.
[125:20.51]Fuck, you heard that.
[125:21.05]Did I ever tell you how I killed my teacher's fish?
[125:25.59]No.
[125:25.95]Oh, no.
[125:27.30]What's that story?
[125:28.32]Wait, is this still Statue of Limitations?
[125:30.24]Can you tell us, or are you going to jail for this?
[125:32.02]No, it's just a long time ago.
[125:33.42]Oh, my teacher had a fish tank.
[125:36.72]And for some, it was like Halloween time.
[125:38.66]We had a bunch of raisins that nobody wanted.
[125:41.77]And me and my friend put raisins in the fish tank.
[125:45.37]And then the next day he like stopped the whole class and said, I was up all night, putting a pencil in the fish, grabbing raisins out of the fish.
[125:54.90]Only me and my friend were laughing and the only me and they were laughing and they caught us because we're the only ones laughing to this weird ass story about him.
[126:03.19]Penciling a fish, the raisins out of the mouth or something.
[126:05.92]Yeah, no, I didn't know the fish would die.
[126:09.96]I felt terrible.
[126:11.54]Oh my God.
[126:14.09]Well, it was one fish.
[126:14.89]I feel terrible.
[126:17.21]You've had your whole life to atone for this, have you?
[126:23.02]I'm trying every day.
[126:25.99]That's right, the journey never truly ends.
[126:28.25]I have caught and eat fish, eaten them, you know, like... So I've also killed fish.
[126:33.76]How fucking dare you?
[126:34.68]Are you crazy?
[126:38.53]I was like ten years old, okay?
[126:43.35]I was like 10 years old when this happened.
[126:45.17]Do raisins go good with fish?
[126:47.65]I thought the fish would like it.
[126:52.12]Yeah, I... You know what?
[126:53.40]I'm gonna say I think that's an alright.
[126:55.46]You tried your best.
[126:56.30]It's okay.
[126:57.32]Things happen.
[126:59.58]I don't know what's going on, but I just got back.
[127:01.81]In Halloween, you get raisins no one wants?
[127:05.29]Sure.
[127:05.57]Back when I was younger, yeah.
[127:07.27]For sure.
[127:08.89]Yeah.
[127:09.35]Raisins smell like cigarettes.
[127:10.30]I'd kill for a raisin now, though.
[127:11.32]Raisins smell like a cigarette box.
[127:14.01]Also, I'm not going to bring it up.
[127:15.63]Never mind.
[127:16.41]Let's go.
[127:18.22]Wow, that's mysterious.
[127:20.36]Yeah.
[127:22.16]Cigarettes smell like raisins.
[127:23.44]I'm not kidding.
[127:25.06]Mount Gelnir?
[127:27.47]Not the smoke.
[127:28.23]The actual, like, in the box.
[127:33.13]Careful, guys.
[127:34.79]Ow!
[127:35.03]That fucking sucks.
[127:37.12]Raisins are pretty good.
[127:37.92]Does it hurt?
[127:39.00]Yeah, it hurts.
[127:39.86]I like chocolate-covered raisins, Poe.
[127:42.82]This is like rumbling my head.
[127:46.76]You ever see those new meta chocolates?
[127:48.18]The dark chocolate acai, the brookside ones?
[127:52.39]Brookside dark chocolate acai blueberry flavor.
[127:55.23]Are they good?
[127:56.24]Dude, they are insane.
[127:57.60]Those are life changing.
[127:59.46]Really?
[128:00.18]I'll have to try them.
[128:00.84]Yeah, they're really good.
[128:03.75]Those are peak.
[128:08.83]Ow.
[128:10.59]It's a scam.
[128:11.53]It's literally everywhere.
[128:12.84]Like the Dubai chocolate.
[128:13.92]Have you guys seen that?
[128:16.50]I have, yeah.
[128:17.18]There's like some viral chocolate snack.
[128:19.31]I don't know what it is.
[128:20.19]My mom likes those.
[128:22.79]Huh.
[128:26.06]Bandage here.
[128:27.74]This is so loud.
[128:30.32]Like loud enough where I know I want to turn it down.
[128:33.05]It's like, dude, that chocolate is like the birria tacos of chocolate.
[128:36.99]Ooh, I do love birria.
[128:38.64]Are you bogeying at me?
[128:40.16]yeah what do you overrated it's overrated if you if you get it from you know not a great place but man I've had it from a really good birria truck and it was it was great really yeah the soup was just like the consummate times it's like it's alright you know what I mean it doesn't look like how it would taste though like it's it's not my favorite thing I don't get it all the time but I like it I don't think it's like it is overrated you know what it is it became a meme
[129:06.16]I've never had food.
[129:07.52]I like Captain Crunch and Gushers and the snack packs.
[129:16.11]I do.
[129:17.95]Yeah, we all do.
[129:20.14]Didn't you wish that was going to happen?
[129:22.42]Yeah.
[129:24.28]It seems so cool.
[129:27.10]Oh, I should probably tell you guys.
[129:29.81]Congratulations.
[129:31.49]Oh.
[129:34.01]Why do I have a four-year-old pallet?
[129:37.15]The complex flavor profile of a green gusher rivals... No, I don't have any food.
[129:46.82]And this sucks over here, by the way.
[129:49.95]I can't keep going with that one.
[129:53.75]Don't split up, Ster!
[129:57.64]Oh, man.
[130:02.42]I don't know what to do.
[130:03.36]Stairs over there.
[130:04.13]We're over here.
[130:04.75]Man, I would really like an ice mountain right about now.
[130:09.47]Stairs Mountain seems way better, I'm not gonna lie.
[130:11.85]Stairs Mountain's better.
[130:14.81]You guys jealous?
[130:16.66]Or we wait for the fire to go down.
[130:18.78]Will it go down?
[130:21.22]Oh, it is going down.
[130:22.26]You get it?
[130:22.66]It's a joke.
[130:23.72]It do go down.
[130:28.05]That's cool, dude.
[130:28.93]I remember that.
[130:31.55]Do you remember when the guy's tucker would turn into a head?
[130:34.43]This is a bad idea.
[130:35.46]Well, I wish that would happen to me.
[130:36.70]Yeah, I don't... I think we could turn into ghosts and watch them play.
[130:39.66]Are we in trouble from this song?
[130:42.30]My future sense is Ruby flying as a ghost.
[130:46.53]Oh my god, this is fucking burning us!
[130:48.25]Oh god!
[130:48.41]We gotta go now!
[130:59.25]We're coming to your mountain.
[131:03.53]Oh shit, can we even make it from here?
[131:18.23]You can make it.
[131:20.12]It hurts a little, but you can get it.
[131:22.18]You good?
[131:31.93]Oh, dude, there's a hang glider up here.
[131:34.83]You can just glide.
[131:35.69]Are you serious?
[131:36.80]Glide?
[131:37.38]What do you mean glide?
[131:38.26]3DFX glide?
[131:42.95]Remember that one?
[131:44.59]Voodoo.
[131:46.21]Yeah, I can just glide the whole way there.
[131:50.30]There's something there.
[131:51.02]Oh!
[132:00.92]Alright, we're okay?
[132:03.06]Let's take it one at a time.
[132:06.99]Guys, you don't need to climb this.
[132:08.65]I was climbing this because I was bored waiting for you.
[132:10.37]There's nothing up here.
[132:11.10]I thought you said there was a hang glider up here.
[132:13.98]Yeah, this ain't Assassin's Creed 2.
[132:15.44]Nah, there's definitely a reason to jump.
[132:17.22]Nah, there's definitely a reason to be up here.
[132:18.79]The chain makes it easy, guys, to get over here.
[132:25.30]What?
[132:25.80]That's fucking crazy, dude.
[132:27.10]Oh my god, I don't have the confidence to do that.
[132:30.72]You got this, come on!
[132:31.88]You can do it, you can do it.
[132:34.19]Yeah!
[132:35.05]Nice, dog!
[132:35.99]Man, that felt kinda good.
[132:37.47]I missed it.
[132:38.01]Hell yeah.
[132:38.25]I was gonna get my phone out.
[132:39.46]That was... This is... This is troublesome and worrying.
[132:42.80]I don't know about this one, but I'll... Oh, dragon eggs!
[132:45.42]Yeah, there are eggs over there.
[132:46.49]Listen, I'm gonna do it.
[132:47.93]Me first!
[132:50.13]Oh.
[132:50.77]Okay.
[132:52.32]I'm gonna try to jump last second.
[132:54.86]Don't land on my head!
[132:56.56]Don't land on my head.
[133:01.16]You're back.
[133:01.56]No, I'm kidding.
[133:04.57]You saw that?
[133:10.30]I need food.
[133:11.58]This is good.
[133:12.60]I have food in my bag.
[133:13.98]Oh, you do?
[133:14.72]No, you don't.
[133:16.16]You liar.
[133:16.66]There's a rope in here.
[133:18.65]Oh, then someone's been eating it.
[133:20.19]Yeah, I don't know.
[133:20.77]Someone stole it.
[133:23.47]Yo, it's raising.
[133:26.04]Oh, God.
[133:28.42]Yeah, I'm staying up here.
[133:30.06]What's up with those eggs?
[133:32.40]I'm not going to eat these because I took the fruit.
[133:34.76]I'm sorry.
[133:35.43]Should I say what we do with the eggs or no?
[133:37.97]Do you want me to be that guy?
[133:40.97]I vote that you can be that guy.
[133:44.84]That's my vote.
[133:45.56]This might kill me.
[133:46.38]This might kill me.
[133:47.10]This might kill me.
[133:48.68]This may kill me.
[133:50.78]I'm watching.
[133:51.30]Don't worry.
[133:51.60]It'll be a good clip.
[133:53.05]Get a clip.
[133:53.47]Get a clip.
[133:53.89]Get a clip.
[133:54.69]Oh, my God.
[133:56.13]Wow.
[133:58.27]Okay, what do we do with the eggs?
[133:59.91]I wouldn't do that.
[134:00.39]Alright, I'm gonna tell you what we do with the egg.
[134:02.09]You throw it at a hot spot on the floor to cook it.
[134:07.58]Oh.
[134:12.92]Wow, he fucking ruined it.
[134:14.72]They're pretty heavy.
[134:16.59]Uh, is that bad?
[134:17.33]Careful, guys!
[134:18.23]Is that bad?
[134:22.27]That looks bad.
[134:23.69]Oh, hey, Vinny!
[134:24.51]Vinny, get the camera!
[134:27.52]I'm watching.
[134:29.12]I don't know if I can make it.
[134:29.86]I have half stamina.
[134:30.66]Oh my god.
[134:31.36]Me too.
[134:31.72]My stamina is pretty low.
[134:35.02]I just went for it.
[134:36.26]Yeah, I just said fuck it.
[134:37.31]I think you can get it.
[134:38.55]Just throw them on the ground.
[134:40.65]Can we just eat them as is or what?
[134:42.81]Because I'm like out of stamina.
[134:45.19]Ooh, ouch.
[134:47.84]Hot spot only.
[134:48.38]Yeah, yeah.
[134:49.64]Right there on the floor probably.
[134:50.94]Right there.
[134:51.96]In between us.
[134:53.56]Just launch it on the floor.
[134:55.17]Like the red spot.
[134:56.53]Alright.
[134:58.93]We need to be able to eat that.
[135:02.10]Okay, I'll get the bottom one.
[135:02.98]Egg!
[135:03.20]Oh, that's a big egg.
[135:06.27]How much stamina do you have?
[135:07.93]Do you have a lot?
[135:08.63]Are you hungry?
[135:09.65]I'm pretty good.
[135:11.61]No, you gotta eat the whole thing.
[135:15.00]Oh, I ate some of that.
[135:17.80]Did you just feed?
[135:18.36]Oh, you fed it to me.
[135:21.07]Who needs?
[135:21.43]I have one more egg.
[135:22.57]I'm gonna put it in your backpack, sir.
[135:25.11]I've got like an inch and a half.
[135:28.05]I got like an inch, inch and a half of... You can't eat your backpack.
[135:31.88]You know what?
[135:34.01]This doesn't look good.
[135:35.47]Yeah, this doesn't look good, but I have an idea.
[135:40.00]It's like a run and jump kind of situation.
[135:42.48]Oh!
[135:43.11]Oh!
[135:47.65]I'm going to eat a lollipop and go for it.
[135:49.53]It's very doable, but you've got to kind of run and jump and grab it and you'll save some stamina.
[135:54.32]How much stamina do you have?
[135:55.96]I have, like, 75%.
[135:57.64]It didn't use all of it.
[135:59.29]Ow, I'm on fire.
[136:00.43]My legs!
[136:01.29]My legs!
[136:08.10]Ow.
[136:08.18]The heat rises, so shouldn't you float?
[136:10.02]I'm behind you!
[136:10.34]Behind you!
[136:11.46]Ow.
[136:11.54]Ow.
[136:11.74]Ow.
[136:12.76]Pull me up, Star.
[136:14.40]Star, pull me up!
[136:18.20]Sorry for screaming.
[136:20.44]This is a scream scream.
[136:23.02]We'll get you, we'll get you, we'll get you.
[136:33.64]You really did.
[136:35.93]We got you, we got you, we got you.
[136:39.37]That's why you got friends.
[136:45.74]will never let you down but Vinny he'll keep climbing I will let you down that is well known I I just randomly turned around yeah and you saved me because I was I was slipping and I didn't want to scream because I feel like I've I feel like I've gotten out two or three screams and I didn't want to be annoying wait now I feel oh my god if I scream next one I'm gonna be I'm gonna be annoying we're good we're good we're good
[137:11.05]You know what, when you're playing with friends and you let out like two or three loud ones and it's like, okay, that's my, that's my quota for the day.
[137:17.64]Like, I can't do that again, right?
[137:19.86]Dude, we played a scary game last time and I got really scared and then Vinny said, oh, we're doing YouTube scares now, right?
[137:24.83]So I got, I'm like self-conscious about opening, just talking.
[137:31.13]I'm getting a view!
[137:32.15]Shut up!
[137:34.88]Oh God, are you alright?
[137:37.36]I got you.
[137:40.35]Okay.
[137:40.47]Are they all the way up?
[137:41.43]Backseat climber.
[137:44.33]This guy fucking has no respect.
[137:45.98]Why is he over there?
[137:47.42]Because I just got a bunch of fucking... Oh my God, he's already winning.
[137:53.59]Okay, Vinny, if I jump from here, you have to catch me.
[137:56.19]The fire is kind of coming.
[137:57.50]I don't know if that's like a... Wait.
[138:00.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[138:01.43]Jump from there.
[138:01.79]What did you just do?
[138:02.76]I promise you, you're going to die.
[138:05.26]How did you get there?
[138:06.20]What do I do?
[138:07.68]You don't go all the way up the mountain.
[138:09.41]I rotated around the mountain.
[138:12.17]Oh, no.
[138:13.21]Oh.
[138:14.91]Yeah, but there's nothing down there.
[138:16.26]Oh, there is.
[138:17.22]There were.
[138:17.58]There were briefcases.
[138:18.60]I got some good items.
[138:19.64]I can help you guys with them.
[138:22.22]Uh-oh.
[138:22.95]I think, yeah.
[138:23.87]Oak has another.
[138:25.11]Does Remedy heal with food or just no food, right?
[138:28.85]I'm supposed to do that?
[138:30.56]I jumped to here.
[138:32.75]Yeah, this is fine.
[138:34.13]Careful.
[138:35.01]That looks painful.
[138:37.09]It's, you know, it sucks a little bit.
[138:38.27]I didn't take any damage.
[138:39.16]Grab the wall and hold that.
[138:42.94]Okay, we're good.
[138:43.98]It's not bad.
[138:45.56]I can't see under here, but fuck it.
[138:47.91]You gotta keep sliding down, boys.
[138:54.86]And Vinny's off again.
[138:56.08]This is why you turn into a goat.
[138:59.36]Alright, we're safe.
[139:01.18]Oh, I think it's gonna rise.
[139:02.26]I think it's about to rise.
[139:03.00]You gotta go.
[139:04.00]Okay, let's go.
[139:08.73]Yeah, the lollipop might kill me.
[139:09.79]But you know what?
[139:10.45]Don't do this.
[139:11.33]I don't know what the best way to do this is, but it's not that sane.
[139:15.25]Let's go.
[139:16.64]We're good.
[139:19.42]Vinny doesn't recommend the chain.
[139:21.60]Are you sure?
[139:22.74]No, I burned up.
[139:24.21]I took damage.
[139:24.75]Oh, come over this way.
[139:25.79]Come over this way.
[139:26.47]This is perfect.
[139:27.03]You can climb around this.
[139:28.39]I'm gonna take this lollipop.
[139:29.95]Come to you.
[139:30.73]Remedy us.
[139:32.55]Never mind.
[139:33.09]Don't go that way.
[139:34.07]Well, Poke isn't coming.
[139:36.60]This way seemed okay.
[139:38.06]I'm right here.
[139:39.46]Yeah, come with me.
[139:40.60]Just crawl around it, you said?
[139:42.56]Which is different.
[139:43.62]I have an egg in my backpack.
[139:46.75]No, I do not.
[139:47.59]I'm right below you.
[139:49.57]Alright.
[139:50.15]Poke, you might have an egg in your backpack.
[139:52.51]And I'm going to jump across.
[139:53.61]It's a remedy mushroom.
[139:56.64]I think so.
[140:00.78]Okay.
[140:01.22]Somebody has an egg in their backpack.
[140:04.08]You got an egg?
[140:04.69]Yeah, we got... Do I?
[140:06.93]You do have an egg.
[140:10.54]The egg.
[140:11.66]No, I don't want to hold this.
[140:13.88]Please take this.
[140:15.55]What are you doing?
[140:16.83]What are you doing?
[140:17.69]I can't move.
[140:18.47]Put it in my bag.
[140:19.24]Put the egg in my bag.
[140:20.42]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[140:26.85]I'm going up, man.
[140:37.40]I don't know, because I'm getting pushed.
[140:40.25]Are you alright?
[140:55.54]Oh fuck, I went way too high.
[141:00.64]It's way too high.
[141:01.92]Don't follow me.
[141:02.81]Oh shit.
[141:03.69]Ow, my legs!
[141:13.76]I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[141:23.99]Dude, it hurts, but you can do it.
[141:30.22]I was further away from them than I expected.
[141:34.12]You gotta grab me.
[141:38.61]Okay, are you guys hurt?
[141:39.33]Are you guys hurt?
[141:39.83]I'm gonna remedy us.
[141:40.89]I'm hurt.
[141:41.25]The fire goes away.
[141:42.31]Fire goes away.
[141:43.31]I got a bandage, though.
[141:45.45]Oh, I'm so hungry.
[141:45.99]Tiny little hurt.
[141:46.95]We can do remedy.
[141:48.54]I'm so hungry.
[141:50.46]Can you say something threatening before you drop it?
[141:53.02]Like Vinny does?
[141:55.07]Oh, we're almost there.
[142:02.02]Dude, I have 50% no stamina.
[142:06.74]Where's the egg?
[142:08.93]No!
[142:09.37]I thought you jumped after the egg, dude.
[142:19.73]Alright.
[142:20.81]If I feed it to you, do I eat it too?
[142:22.81]No.
[142:23.31]Here, you... How much stamina do you have?
[142:29.30]Uh, sliver.
[142:31.48]Okay, you should take this then.
[142:32.76]You take it.
[142:35.06]I'll heal.
[142:36.86]No, no.
[142:37.23]I'll come back for you.
[142:37.85]You take this.
[142:40.47]Okay, I'm good.
[142:41.29]I'm good.
[142:41.71]I'm good.
[142:43.71]I feel like... Run and jump to the chain.
[142:49.11]Are you sure?
[142:49.87]I don't know, dude.
[142:50.47]I feel like this is going to kill us.
[142:52.13]Why are they pinging that side?
[142:54.15]I had like 75% stamina and I made it.
[142:56.93]I can pull you.
[142:57.74]Oh, you guys went different ways.

[143:21.72]I got this lollipop.
[143:22.52]I'm afraid to eat it though.
[143:25.83]Watch me.
[143:27.89]You'll fall asleep, but you'll have infinite stamina for like 10 seconds, 15 seconds.
[143:32.34]I feel like a... I got you.

[143:39.55]Oh God, you're bringing me down.
[143:40.93]Jesus.
[143:42.15]Oh God.

[147:11.47]The total bill had to have been like 500 bucks, 600 bucks.

[147:40.79]I tipped $100.
[147:41.44]I tipped $100, not $300.
[147:44.78]That's pretty amazing.
[147:47.06]Who eats PlayStation?
[147:50.60]We're in the future, man.
[147:52.53]It's crazy.
[147:56.93]$1,000 tip for a Dr. Pepper.
[148:02.56]I feel like you're making a video at that point.
[148:04.88]You know what I mean?
[148:05.40]Like, hey, by the way, you're going to open the door and put a camera in that person's face.
[148:11.06]He didn't have any English.
[148:12.71]He had no English.
[148:13.95]I think he was really happy then.
[148:19.59]Eleven days.
[148:20.59]Take it or double it and send it to somebody else.
[148:23.52]Oh my god.
[148:24.70]Well, the Dr. Pepper wasn't meeting the delivery minimum, so he just added a PS5.
[148:31.40]This looks messed up.
[148:33.39]This looks hard.
[148:35.37]Oh, we're going upy?
[148:39.19]What if we just, what if we just die?
[148:42.28]Guys, what if we just die?
[148:45.91]You didn't even have your marshmallow?
[148:48.89]Yeah, because I saved it.
[148:50.05]Well, now what?
[148:51.96]Efficiency!
[148:52.70]Efficiency!
[148:53.52]Beautiful!
[148:57.90]No, I'm not.
[148:59.87]You guys need rope or?
[149:04.27]No.
[149:08.08]I have a chain gun.
[149:12.57]I have a very important question.
[149:16.07]What if the volcano erupts?
[149:19.06]It was a good life.
[149:23.24]When you start clicking, it sounds like one of those old teeth toys that are just chattering.
[149:30.29]You're going to hear every click.
[149:32.83]Dude, he said it was a mouth noise too.
[149:34.31]What the hell was a mouth noise?
[149:35.47]I'm right here whenever you're ready, Poke.
[149:40.34]I can pull you.
[149:45.67]Is he already up?
[149:48.27]Hello?
[149:53.00]Hello?
[149:56.29]Are you guys up?
[149:58.03]I was waiting to help Poke up.

[150:05.57]Poke, I'm here.
[150:08.60]Poke, I got you.
[150:10.90]Yep.
[150:11.84]Crawl up the wall.
[150:14.53]Wall side.
[150:19.71]Can you make it up to the wall side?
[150:28.81]Here, I got a water.
[150:30.42]I'm going to drop a water right... Poke, are you okay?
[150:35.36]I fungus myself.
[150:36.50]I'm good.
[150:36.84]Are you good?
[150:38.10]I thought that was your body.
[150:39.43]I thought that was like you liquefying.
[150:44.33]Grab me!
[150:46.23]You're not visible.
[150:49.60]Oh, my God.
[150:49.84]I'm going to drop a water.
[150:51.00]I'm dropping a sports drink.
[150:52.10]Okay.

[151:10.80]There you go.
[151:18.33]Yeah!
[151:19.89]I pulled you through.
[151:20.85]I pulled you through the crevice.
[151:22.84]Okay.
[151:27.47]Thank you.
[151:32.00]I'm just going to stay.
[151:32.86]Yeah, you're good.
[151:39.79]Thankfully, there's a lot of little ledges you can kind of just sit on.
[151:44.99]Oh shit, this is not a good place.
[151:48.57]Poke this bad bad very bad like excruciatingly bad.
[151:53.14]Okay.
[151:53.98]Yeah, this is a bad place to be.
[151:59.73]I'm going to try to get the next ledge.
[152:02.19]There's a rope here.
[152:05.87]If you can get up.
[152:06.48]I can't.
[152:16.81]I can't.
[152:18.13]I can't.
[152:20.98]I got- do you want a lollipop?
[152:22.22]I got a lollipop too.
[152:23.95]Oh fuck.
[152:27.53]Do you want the lollipop?
[152:36.08]Are you okay?
[152:40.57]Poke, I have a lollipop.
[152:43.75]If I drop it will you eat it?
[152:45.24]He's dead.
[152:47.64]He's dead!
[152:49.12]He's dead!
[152:58.48]How did the piton work?
[153:00.90]It worked.
[153:01.78]It's sadly gone now, but yeah, I mean, it was good.
[153:06.57]You just hold right click.
[153:07.67]You have to hold it for a bit.
[153:08.87]Otherwise, it doesn't work.
[153:10.52]Does it reset your stamina?
[153:13.96]It does, yeah, if you wait a minute.
[153:21.29]I don't know where to go from here.
[153:22.83]Help me.
[153:25.26]Just, yeah.
[153:27.40]Okay, I'm doing alright.
[153:39.83]I hope I can get up this.
[153:42.05]I know I'm waiting for it.
[153:45.04]I think he's gonna come out of the wall.
[153:48.00]OK, good.
[153:50.05]Does anyone here have the ability to shoot a chain or anything?
[153:53.87]Did anyone pick up the anti-rope?
[153:54.79]Why does this get so loud?
[153:55.92]Poke had the anti-rope.
[153:58.54]Fuck.
[153:58.72]I have a... Somebody grab me, please.
[154:02.32]Somebody grab me.
[154:03.08]Somebody grab me.
[154:06.17]We can't all fit here.
[154:07.87]I'll go over here.
[154:08.29]I'll go over here.
[154:09.11]I have a chain launcher.
[154:10.97]I've got a chain launcher.
[154:11.81]Oh, can you shoot up behind you?
[154:14.44]Like up here?
[154:15.58]I'm thinking, yeah, like there.

[154:30.46]I'll go last.
[154:34.25]I'll go now.
[154:37.17]That's a scary little crevice.
[154:38.57]I didn't do a great job shooting that.
[154:41.57]I... I... I'm good.
[154:42.46]We got it, though.
[154:43.06]It's good.
[154:45.44]Ster?

[155:00.88]Sorry, you have to become a ghost.
[155:04.43]There were just two of you for a second.
[155:05.61]That was weird.
[155:06.39]Yeah, you're like doubling.
[155:08.37]Wait, what?
[155:09.97]I think it's the heat.
[155:12.02]Oh.
[155:13.02]I think we can climb this if I put my thing in the wall.
[155:16.00]Does anybody have any food?
[155:18.73]If you don't, I had a first aid kit.
[155:20.69]It's all I have.
[155:21.25]I have a lollipop, but I'm only gonna use it for an emergency.

[156:33.87]We gotta find a different way to go.
[156:36.44]What about over there?
[156:38.14]I think we can go over there.

[157:12.47]I'm not gonna scare you guys, but I wish I was alive still.
[157:15.47]Oh, you died.
[157:17.16]Yeah, I did.
[157:19.02]You know what happens when you spam space?
[157:21.82]You build momentum.

[157:57.52]It ain't gonna work.
[157:58.40]I'm going a different way.
[158:03.23]I'm going this way.
[158:04.13]Fuck that.
[158:05.83]Is there... Okay, hold on.
[158:16.10]That's a good idea.
[158:19.46]I mean, it's tough to get to it, but maybe there's something good in there, I don't know.
[158:26.49]Hey, did you guys watch any new movies?
[158:28.55]How do I meet Ghost?
[158:29.27]Oh, he's dead.
[158:35.00]Hey, my rope almost went to good use!
[158:38.22]Yeah, Lord of the Rings.
[158:41.02]Dude, the FOV was so wide there that I was not even close.
[158:47.47]Did you see how wide that fucking FOV was?
[158:49.72]I may have been in a different country.
[158:57.65]Oh, that's funny.
[159:05.78]Oh man, we were right there.
[159:18.08]New hats, that's cool.
[159:27.77]That was a lot of fun.
[159:28.65]That was actually really fun.
[159:37.68]Vinny one.
[159:38.57]Oh yeah, that's cool.
[159:40.29]I didn't know you could win because you lose score because you died.
[159:46.26]Well, fellas, that's probably enough for me because I hate to do this again, but the dinner meme.
[159:52.59]I have to eat dinner.
[159:54.41]I just got dinner.
[159:55.01]I got chicken katsu, baby.
[159:56.54]Ooh.
[159:58.02]No, that was fun.
[159:59.38]I feel like we got really far for our first real actual game.
[160:03.86]That was fun.
[160:04.44]I enjoyed that a lot.
[160:05.35]That was good friends gaming.
[160:08.27]That was a good friend slop time.
[160:09.77]That was a good friend slop, yeah.

[162:48.55]I want to get some lunch.
[162:49.95]That's a good place to stop.
[162:51.06]I think that was a great great great friend slop time.
[163:00.09]But I'll tell you this Sunday we actually are going to do some stuff.
[163:05.03]We're going to do.
[163:10.03]Dracula 3.
[163:12.47]We supposed to do that last weekend, but it got moved a little.
[163:17.84]I plan on doing that on Sunday.
[163:21.72]So that is the next time you will probably see the stream live is Sunday with Dracula 3.
[163:26.60]Probably going to start pretty late in the in the day so we get the night time.
[163:32.77]Probably might have a couple of bush lights, maybe.
[163:40.72]I do want to play at least one hour of the new Five Nights at Freddy's.
[163:49.38]Not that I want to play it for real.
[163:50.62]I just think it's funny to play it for like an hour.
[163:56.03]So we might do that on Sunday too.
[163:58.05]I have a ton of itch.io scary game random one hour 15 minute experiences.
[164:04.48]I still have a ton of them so we can do that on Sunday.
[164:07.00]Okay.
[164:13.26]We'll do another Scare Sundays, but 95% potentially Dracula 3 until I can't take it anymore.
[164:21.49]Oh, there's nothing on the screen.
[164:22.53]Sorry about that.
[164:27.69]I need to get this video back up.
[164:38.24]What about Deltarune?
[164:39.28]I don't have a plan to stream Deltarune.
[164:44.85]I do have a plan to go back to Dream.
[164:46.23]I'll do that on Sunday as well.
[164:47.71]We'll do Dreamcore as well.
[164:48.63]We'll just do it on... We'll do a ton of shit on Sunday.
[165:01.17]What about... Wow.
[165:02.33]Wow.
[165:02.77]Classic.
[165:06.73]Those were some cozy streams.
[165:08.06]I liked those.
[165:09.38]It was... It was actually really nice just to play and just kind of hang out.
[165:13.70]So...
[165:15.19]I've got a couple of idle games that I just kind of want to chill and play for four or five, six hours.
[165:20.08]Just hang out and just talk and just do nothing.
[165:24.22]So, we'll do them.
[165:30.55]I-D-L-E.
[165:32.85]There's this wizard game.
[165:33.81]There's this fish game.
[165:34.83]You have a fish tank.
[165:36.39]There's a wizard tower or something.
[165:38.70]Looked kind of fun.
[165:44.12]We'll check it out.
[165:49.41]I also want to do a dark room as well.
[165:53.42]Dark room is a fun browser game.
[165:55.74]I feel like it could be a good chill kind of.
[165:58.94]Evening stream nighttime stream.
[166:08.87]But thanks for hanging out.
[166:14.16]Appreciate you guys sticking around.
[166:18.56]That was a great day.
[166:19.44]That was fun.
[166:19.98]That was a really fun stream.
[166:22.36]I feel like it's a great place just to kind of edit right there.
[166:25.35]Any of them still going?
[166:26.99]Who's still streaming out of the three or four of them?
[166:29.11]Probably at least a couple of them, right?
[166:38.38]Ster still going?
[166:44.55]Go hang out with Ster.
[166:47.99]Behave, though.
