[00:01.57]Alright, unfortunately we're gonna have to pivot.
[00:03.83]Because Beautiful Joe's not gonna work either because this memory card is just like toast.
[00:10.14]Alright, good, cool.
[00:11.58]So I'm gonna have a new memory card.
[00:13.12]It'll work tomorrow.
[00:14.84]Alright, so we're gonna pivot.
[00:16.93]We're gonna pivot.
[00:18.53]I'm gonna use the same fucking console.
[00:21.89]We're gonna pivot to the Wii.
[00:25.69]It's time to pivot.
[00:33.99]We're pivoting to Rage Cooking Mama Cook-Off.
[00:39.65]That's a hard fucking rage pivot if I've ever seen one.
[00:46.72]Give me the fucking disk.
[00:53.18]Unbelievable.
[00:54.20]Unbelievable.
[01:04.04]I'm going to be on cam for this one.
[01:05.44]Fuck me.
[01:14.09]Imagine wanting Rain World over Cooking Mama.
[01:16.57]I mean, they're both pretty interesting.
[01:29.05]So tomorrow, we're going to do this again tomorrow.
[01:36.89]I see that it takes 10 minutes for the SD card, but I don't even know where an SD card is.
[01:43.35]I have to go look for where my SD cards are.
[01:46.34]That's like a 30 to 40 minute experience.
[01:49.98]It's not just, download two items, download, and it's done.
[01:53.92]We're in the middle of a broadcast.
[01:55.36]I'm not going to be like, I'll show you guys in 30 minutes.
[01:57.85]Or I can look for an SD card.
[02:03.68]There's one somewhere in this house, and I don't know where it is.
[02:06.70]No, we're just going to do it tomorrow.
[02:14.28]In your Wii?
[02:14.88]I don't have an SD card in the Wii.
[02:20.74]Alright, let's go.
[02:23.06]Here, you know what?
[02:23.74]Let's just do this.
[02:24.75]Welcome to the stream, because we're starting over.
[02:26.55]See you in a second.
[03:19.68]We're also going to go on cam for this one.
[03:21.34]Because, you know, I have the Wiimotes and shit in my hand.

[03:34.09]We're welcome, everybody, to the stream.
[03:35.87]Hope you guys had a good couple of days here.
[03:43.11]I've been alright.
[03:43.65]I've been okay.
[03:44.23]I've been pretty good.
[03:50.92]I had to run in with some flash memory over the last couple of days.
[03:55.50]I don't want to take... I'm thinking about taking a hammer to something.
[04:01.10]You know, just nothing too major.
[04:05.82]Yeah, we'll get started.
[04:06.34]We're going to do Cooking Mama Cook-Off.
[04:08.92]Cooking Mama Cook-Off.
[04:10.20]That's what I've heard we're going to do today.
[04:16.21]Sounds good.
[04:18.27]Alright, let me just make a tweet.
[04:19.28]Let me delete the old tweet that I had.
[04:21.32]I had, like, something was wrong with my iPhone, like, an hour and a half ago.
[04:25.04]It said... It said... The Chibi-Robo.
[04:28.30]I didn't... I didn't write that.
[04:29.90]Something happened.
[04:30.54]I got, like, a fucking virus or something.
[04:40.26]Alright.
[04:41.32]I'm ready.
[04:43.62]I'm so sad.
[04:44.30]I like it.
[04:45.64]It worked too.
[04:47.20]I'm haunted by a fucking ghost.
[04:50.45]There's a ghost that follows me everywhere.
[04:53.27]Like a technology ghost.
[04:56.55]Alright, let's go.
[05:04.81]Cooking Mama.
[05:05.59]I'm ready.
[05:06.43]I actually am excited for this one too.
[05:08.31]I also have to change the title.
[05:11.09]Because this doesn't make any sense.
[05:16.06]The Ultimate Household... The Ultimate Household Chef.
[05:20.48]How does that sound?
[05:21.10]The Ultimate Household Chef?
[05:22.38]I just have to change one word.
[05:33.96]Cooking Mama.
[05:34.78]How many Cooking Mamas are there?
[05:40.56]There's like 30 of these games?
[05:44.80]Alright, let's go.
[05:48.33]That looked weird.
[05:48.85]Alright, let's get a good view of me and my Wii.
[05:57.29]I've got my Wiimote.
[05:58.09]I've got my nunchuck.
[06:03.39]Let me make this look better.
[06:13.10]Okay.
[06:15.42]I'm ready.
[06:24.11]Time to chop and cut to eat.
[06:29.35]Why do I look so mad?
[06:32.41]Well,
[06:34.17]What hour and 25 minutes went by of a game I wanted to play and my fucking GameCube memory card was corrupted?
[06:40.88]I don't think it's sunshine and rainbows right now for me.
[06:46.36]Yes, I do.
[06:47.00]I would love to create a save file.
[06:51.58]Watch this not work either.
[06:59.63]Hey, by the way, no hand strap physically even on this Wiimote.
[07:05.76]He's got a corrupted Wii.
[07:13.41]I'm ready.
[07:15.65]Should I go- I should go like- You guys- Can you guys see my hands?

[11:39.63]Alright, Ster.
[11:40.91]Point the Wiimote down and move it around quickly.

[13:01.83]Alright, I'm almost done with it, right?
[13:24.86]Alright, this is just twist the remote while holding the A button to adjust the oven.
[13:29.34]Watch the meter carefully.
[13:30.32]When it reaches the red part, switch it off.
[13:34.82]What?

[14:56.30]Oh, a fuckin' grilled cheese slider!
[14:59.38]Alright, what, what, I want like a, a real, I want, I don't want just like a piece of custard.
[15:07.16]Let's do, uh, soup.
[15:09.22]Finistrone.
[15:13.36]Hold the Wiimote upright.
[15:14.38]Yeah, alright.
[15:15.14]Upright and move it forward and backward.
[15:17.31]This is to open the can.
[15:19.25]Press the A button when the meter gets to the yellow portion to open the lid.
[15:28.72]Why is it coming out of a... Mama, you're using a toaster oven.
[15:49.55]You're getting soup out of a can.
[15:51.17]Alright.
[15:55.67]Move it so we can peel the potatoes.
[15:59.56]Move it from the top to the bottom to peel the skin.
[16:01.76]Okay.
[16:15.59]Not efficient.
[16:17.25]Very inefficient.
[16:33.48]Alright, it's done.
[16:34.47]It's done.
[16:46.61]I- This is where mom doesn't ask you to do this again.
[16:51.16]This is where you peel the carrot to a point where there's like a toothpick worth of carrot.
[17:00.43]It just turns into this skinny little shitty thing.
[17:02.73]Because you peeled off the skin and you peeled off all the actual vegetables.
[17:06.65]Got it.
[17:11.41]Alright, we're good.
[17:14.55]Oh, you did it better than Mama!
[17:16.79]See that?
[17:22.13]Alright, finally chopped.
[17:25.04]First, trace the arrow with the- I spit all over my mouth.
[17:29.49]Raise the arrow with the Wiimote to cut the ingredients.
[17:31.47]When they are cut, shake the Wiimote up and down to finely chop them.
[17:35.41]So I go boink and then dup dup dup dup dup dup dup.
[18:00.46]Onion.
[18:37.09]Very good.
[18:40.03]Move the Wiimote forward and backward to cut the- More cutting!
[18:42.89]More cutting!
[18:45.81]Okay, I can do this.
[18:46.62]I'm pretty good at the cutting.
[18:48.92]Bacon!
[18:50.32]There's a lot of bacon!
[18:51.46]This is like a whole loaf of ham!
[19:04.82]Ster fry this is alright To add to the pan select icons with the a button move the wii mode toward and away from you to prevent burning When the when two circles appear press finished
[19:19.78]We just like, this is how you pretend to be a chef.

[19:43.84]It'll work every time.
[19:45.75]Put some green beans, some bell peppers, some onions, and a little bit of other water-based vegetables.
[19:53.19]And just shake it like, yeah, I know what I'm doing!
[19:55.67]This is the I pretend to know how to fucking cook stream!
[19:58.23]I don't know why I'm streaming this, but, you know.
[20:04.76]And then make something up while they have to leave.
[20:09.50]Alright, let's put the bacon in.
[20:11.39]Onions.
[20:12.38]Green beans, carrots, potatoes, any matter.
[20:14.60]Then just do this.

[27:01.99]Why?
[27:02.45]I got it, right?
[27:04.41]Try harder?

[27:44.30]Tilt the Wiimote upward to stop the water before it overflows.
[28:00.39]Oh, I only get one shot.
[28:02.33]I only get one shot.
[28:08.82]Why am I apologizing?
[28:13.24]Why am I apologizing?
[28:14.80]What do I do?
[28:16.47]Point the Wiimote down and hold it upright.
[28:22.89]How long did it take this time?
[28:23.79]An hour?
[28:24.07]40 minutes?
[28:30.03]You're swearing.
[28:30.69]Okay.
[28:33.57]Point the Wiimote down and hold it upright.
[28:35.27]Move it around quickly to wash.
[28:37.05]When done, tilt the Wiimote to drain the water.
[28:39.21]So you go... And then like this.
[28:42.47]Say sorry to Mama.
[28:46.77]Mama's not a real person.
[28:58.95]What, did I just knock it over?
[29:03.09]I just, I just washed everything and just dumped it onto the counter.
[29:16.64]Go back, go back.
[29:17.36]No, no, do it again.
[29:20.92]I wanna make mochi.
[29:22.04]Okay.
[29:23.00]I'm ready.
[29:31.99]Ooooh!
[29:38.99]Jerma HATES Mama. No!
[29:40.99]I just said fuck. Like aw fuck you game.
[29:48.99]I don't have to apologize to somebody that- No! I'm not apologizing to anything on the Wii right now.
[29:52.99]I'm very upset with the Wii right now. And the GameCube memory card in particular.
[30:01.37]Alright. Move it around quickly to watch, then tilt the Wiimote to drain the water.
[30:07.36]Isn't that what I did?
[30:09.20]Okay, A. Now tilt.
[30:19.65]What the fuck is going on there?
[30:23.57]I was going a little...
[30:32.04]Whatever.
[30:33.74]Old A?
[30:37.08]Watch the meter carefully.
[30:37.96]When the bar gets to red, switch it off.
[30:48.59]That was fuckin' simple.
[30:52.37]Floor Mochi.
[31:03.74]Alright, pound the mochi.
[31:04.68]Move the Wii down to pound the rice.
[31:06.80]Take care not to accidentally hit your hand.
[31:11.02]There's no hand.
[31:15.40]Mama, I'm sorry!
[31:35.14]Mama's gonna have fucking bruises all over her.
[31:43.85]I've tried to do twice before.
[32:03.20]You gotta go into the doctor's office like this!
[32:07.35]I'm covered in fucking wilted fucking bruises and shit!
[32:10.67]Oh, this is so bad!
[32:16.02]I'll get this one next time.
[32:20.34]I need to practice.
[32:23.74]Hold the Wii Remote upright and move it left and right.
[32:26.14]If it gets hard to grate, move the Wii Remote up and down to shake the loose ingredients.
[32:31.68]Am I gonna grate the cheese?
[32:33.12]This cheese?
[32:33.50]Get off!
[32:52.52]This is a shitload of cheese, Mama.
[32:58.23]Mama, what are you doing?
[32:59.78]Why is there so much cheese on this?
[33:01.50]Wonderful.
[33:04.68]Better than Mama.
[33:08.52]You know what I do whenever I'm cooking with- when I grate a bunch of cheese like that?
[33:11.98]I get a little overwhelmed, and I just grab the whole mound, the soft, like, mushy, like, stick-together mound of poncho cheese, and I just eat the whole fucking thing.
[33:23.21]And then I have to do it again.
[33:24.21]Hold on- okay, make some mochi.
[33:33.89]So just follow the on-screen actions.
[33:35.19]So it's like left and right, tilt, turn.
[33:37.05]Okay.
[33:37.33]Put it into the flower.
[33:42.39]Roll it back and forth a couple times.
[33:44.28]Get it dusted.
[33:45.50]Into the chocolate.
[33:46.20]Into the chocolate.
[33:47.72]Soak it up.
[33:48.28]Good.
[34:04.99]Wrap it up.
[34:05.89]Wrap it up.
[34:06.77]One more?
[34:07.25]Come on, hurry up.
[34:08.27]Done.
[34:08.59]Chocolate and cheese.
[34:09.85]Well, that's what it looked like.
[34:12.71]Whatever.
[34:12.99]Well, I don't even know what it was.
[34:15.44]Complete.
[34:16.06]Alright.
[34:35.18]Mochi.
[34:35.68]I'm probably going to have to do this again.
[34:42.71]We're on start.
[34:44.87]I still completed it.
[34:48.71]Free cookies?
[34:49.57]You have a new recipe?
[34:51.07]Um, I don't know what that is.
[34:54.10]I'm looking forward to it, though.
[34:57.72]Should I do the scrambled eggs?
[35:00.14]I didn't even see... Oh, I thought it was scrambled eggs.
[35:02.08]It's scrambled eggs.
[35:03.24]I'd make a brutally good scrambled egg.
[35:05.16]What I do is I panic when I get the eggs into the pan, and I freak out because I don't want to underdo them, and I end up overdoing them by about five straight minutes.
[35:13.61]But they're, like, brown all over.
[35:15.43]So, I make a pretty mean scrambled egg.
[35:17.55]Okay, swing the Wiimote in order to tap the egg on the bowl.
[35:20.79]Is it good?
[35:25.57]That's good!
[35:26.95]Excellent!
[35:29.11]Awesome!
[35:29.75]Do not mine!
[35:32.27]Do not mine!
[35:52.37]Wonderful.
[35:53.45]Alright, open the can.
[35:54.58]I need to do a test here.
[35:56.52]Hold on.
[36:00.80]We're way off.
[36:03.36]Wait, hold on.
[36:04.96]Ready?
[36:06.26]Ready?
[36:23.99]Up.
[36:24.15]Up.
[36:24.47]Up.
[36:24.55]Right.
[36:24.89]Right.
[36:55.70]Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, I got it, I got it.
[37:04.52]Up!
[37:08.40]Right!
[37:10.64]Up!
[37:13.52]Right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye.
[37:20.07]Good, right?
[37:21.85]Better?
[37:24.17]Blue.
[37:26.37]Blue.
[37:29.76]It's better.
[37:30.44]It might take a little bit more moving around.
[37:45.50]You need a psychiatrist.
[37:47.92]I'm trying to sync my gameplay to my webcam?
[37:57.35]Alright, scramble the eggs.
[38:01.78]What the hell is that?
[38:04.00]Egg?
[38:08.42]Why is it doing like this weird mystery thing?
[38:12.31]Cream cheese.
[38:12.95]I don't know what the fuck cream cheese looks like in this game.
[38:17.15]Milk.
[38:19.07]How's it not milk?
[38:28.11]Alright, now in goes the prosciutto.
[38:30.02]Alright, I'm alright.
[38:35.91]Just grab.
[38:37.59]And I got- I did it, I did the wing.
[39:03.70]you
[39:34.86]Down.
[39:35.52]Down.
[39:36.22]Down.
[39:36.88]Down.
[39:37.56]Down.
[39:38.06]I think we're good.
[39:41.34]Spread the butter.
[39:42.08]Build the Wiimote carefully to coat the frying pan with butter.
[39:52.07]Getting better.
[39:55.95]A little bit.
[40:02.18]It's gonna stick right there!
[40:03.60]Gotta get it all before the time runs out!
[40:05.70]Gotta- Let's go read a bunch of books!
[40:11.36]Good idea!
[40:14.33]Increase your smarts!
[40:15.39]Alright, cook eggs.
[40:19.01]Shake.
[40:19.37]Shake the Wiimote.
[40:21.31]Back and forth.
[40:22.81]Hold Wiimote upright.
[40:25.53]And turn it around while holding B button.
[40:27.21]Season.
[40:27.67]Shake Wiimote while holding A button.
[40:29.63]Okay.
[40:31.48]Let's cook these eggs.
[40:48.50]Not too much.
[40:49.00]Alright, they're done, they're done, they're done, they're done, they're done, they're done, they're done!
[40:58.78]Mama, too much salt.
[41:09.47]Looks like vomit.
[41:12.49]Mama, mama, sodium.
[41:13.63]Mama, too much sodium.
[41:21.16]I don't like salty eggs.
[41:23.98]I'd rather take... Instead of putting a bunch of salt on eggs, I'd like to do just a little dollop of tabas... I was going to say tabascio, like pistachio.
[41:32.94]Tabasco sauce.
[41:35.26]Just like...
[41:37.49]And then you just, like, let it get in there?
[41:44.43]Tabasco!
[41:45.50]Tabasco!
[41:47.72]It's a... New, what's this?
[41:56.92]Beef in wine sauce.
[41:58.60]Ooh, I like it.
[42:02.52]Okay, trace the arrow with the Wii Remote to cut the ingredients.
[42:06.67]This is elaborate.
[42:07.39]This one's a lot.
[42:08.04]Alright, I gotta get a good score here.
[42:36.62]I love a good wine.
[42:42.43]Alright, we gotta peel.
[42:43.61]I was bad at this before.
[43:05.86]One fluid motion.
[43:07.62]Oh, this one hurts my ADHD so bad.
[43:21.90]You know what I mean?
[43:23.14]Uh, it's hurt- I- Fuck, this hurts my ADHD.
[43:30.74]Like, it hurts my whole body.
[43:33.32]Yeah, some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[43:36.74]Alright, mince the beef.
[43:42.32]Shake the wee bone up and down to chop the ingredients.
[43:44.81]That's it, so just chop.
[43:54.57]Oh, I love that.
[44:04.04]The shallots.
[44:07.28]That looks like a banana.
[44:10.89]Get the mushrooms in there.
[44:11.79]Okay, use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.
[44:23.13]This one.
[44:23.51]You have to guess.
[44:26.51]Point at the item, pick it up with the B button.
[44:28.80]Alright, here we go.
[44:35.83]Okay.
[44:37.55]And pepper.
[44:39.81]And... What's that?
[44:42.07]Uh, gravy?
[44:42.63]And then... Vegetables.
[44:44.75]And then a little bit of this.
[44:47.57]Whatever it is.
[44:48.41]Garnish.
[44:49.73]Is that time?
[44:57.80]Is it a coincidence that the Blade and Sorcery video went up on YouTube the day you played Cooking Mama and you made a Cooking Mama joke in this video?
[45:08.41]Yeah, I think so.
[45:10.61]Sprinkle!
[45:13.21]Coat the ingredients, press A and the B button at the same time to sprinkle.
[45:23.45]But I didn't... Is that too much?
[45:27.53]Awesome!
[45:37.31]I don't know what I'm seasoning it with.
[45:40.17]I'm just dumping shit on it.
[45:41.52]I think that's alright.
[45:49.54]Why is she so... Wait, she... Result great.
[45:54.78]What's going on?
[45:55.79]Alright, spread the butter.
[45:58.69]Alright, I called the butter in the pan.
[45:59.93]I know this one.
[46:03.19]Around the edges first.
[46:05.27]Okay.
[46:08.56]Done, done, done, done, done, done, done!
[46:23.60]Okay, Ster fry.
[46:25.28]Alright, let's go.
[46:29.53]Get it all in there.
[46:30.19]Alright, what cooks the longest?
[46:33.09]Uh, put the beef in first.
[46:38.99]And then the mushroom And then put the rest in Not bad, keep going
[47:07.17]It's charred.
[47:08.23]It's charred, mate.
[47:09.39]It's charred.
[47:10.07]That's what I'm saying.
[47:10.69]Alright.
[47:12.27]Rotate the Wii mode.
[47:13.23]Add.
[47:13.63]Okay.
[47:13.95]This is the stew part.
[47:15.66]Put it all in the stew.
[47:20.42]Add.
[47:21.62]Salt.
[47:23.54]Medium heat.
[47:26.54]Come medium.
[47:29.34]Ster it up.
[47:29.94]Add a little bit of whatever the fuck this is.
[47:36.89]Put it on high Put a little bit of whatever this is, a tied up thing Ster it up Put it on low, perfectly done Perfectly done How's it look?
[47:53.10]Pretty good
[48:06.50]I don't like a chunky potato stew, though.
[48:08.72]I like my potatoes to be cubed.
[48:12.84]If I do not have cubed potatoes, I don't like it.
[48:16.91]And they have to be less than a half inch thick and a half inch wide, you know what I'm saying?
[48:21.07]I want cubed potatoes.
[48:23.01]Big chunky potatoes don't do it for me.
[48:29.61]And the beef has to be also a cube-like shape.
[48:34.88]I don't like big, stringy, long... I gotta pull it... No, no, no.
[48:41.13]It's gotta be cubed.
[48:43.01]Small, cubed-up meat.
[48:52.85]All carrots must be a perfect small circle in diameter, like this.
[48:57.70]Like, very small.
[48:59.84]And they have to be less than a half-inch thick.
[49:08.57]alright we move on to this next one oh shrimp and chili sauce pierogi popcorn of the united states oh what do we have oh we have like lots of great italian and french cuisine minestrone oh this is Japanese mochi oh France scrambled eggs what do we have from America popcorn
[49:40.37]This is one step.
[49:53.35]I love making popcorn on the stove, though.
[49:54.75]It is actually really good.
[49:55.61]You gotta be careful, though, because you might put too much in, and that's when it starts to pop.
[50:00.11]The lid starts to go up, and you start to make too much.
[50:02.95]You start to freak out.
[50:05.99]Look at this American cuisine.
[50:08.65]Gotta keep it in the yellow, that's it.
[50:20.30]It's not burning, it's fine.
[50:38.60]Ah, classic American cuisine.
[50:44.24]Add seasoning.
[50:45.00]Why is it an open, like, salami sandwich?
[50:50.62]When the bottle blinks, shake the Wiimote.
[50:52.84]Shake with good timing to s- When the bottle blinks?
[50:57.92]What?
[50:58.32]What's going on?
[51:06.00]Will the bottle blink?
[51:07.42]No bottle is blinking.
[51:09.14]What do you mean the bottle blinks?
[51:16.89]Who's putting the salt on?
[51:22.35]That's not blink.
[51:23.37]That's not blinking, by the way.
[51:25.57]That is growth.
[51:27.33]That's growing and shrinking.
[51:29.91]That's not a blink.
[51:31.31]A little more.
[51:36.48]Just like a typical American dish, it's loaded with as much salt as you can physically fucking tolerate.
[51:45.47]There's no wink, liars.
[51:48.35]You're a great chef.
[51:50.39]Hey, thanks.
[52:07.26]Oh, another classic American dish, the hot dog.

[52:24.33]Popcorn.
[52:25.89]Macaroni and cheese.
[52:30.49]Look, we're gonna get another thing with an American flag that's like Cheerios.
[52:36.14]And you just have to pick them up like a baby.
[52:37.91]Just eat them one by one on one of those toddler dishes.
[52:43.91]What's a classic American food?
[52:49.63]What's a classic American dish?

[53:27.42]Diner food?
[53:28.08]Yeah, but that's not... Diner food is just a place... That's like a genre of restaurant style.
[53:37.45]That's not like classic American recipe.
[53:40.05]Diner.
[53:41.51]AFC?
[53:42.15]Nah.
[53:42.69]Yeah, I guess so.

[54:41.33]Eggs.
[54:50.59]I fucking can't do the eggs.
[54:52.93]Even in fucking fake life.
[54:57.80]Good job!
[55:01.26]Light, light, light!
[55:02.60]Light!
[55:03.12]That's good!
[55:06.46]Play!
[55:07.22]Do not die!
[55:08.40]Excellent!
[55:10.50]Wonderful!
[55:12.30]Better than Mama!
[55:26.20]NA doesn't have much distinctive because it's all brought from other countries.
[55:29.38]Yeah.
[55:30.24]But, I mean, like barbecue.
[55:31.73]Like a smoked barbecue brisket.
[55:33.39]That's pretty American.
[55:39.91]No, it isn't.
[55:40.41]What are you talking about?
[55:44.50]If you get smoked barbecue brisket from America, it's going to be better than anywhere else on Earth.
[55:48.92]That's a fact.
[55:51.86]Literally any chef on Earth will tell you that.
[55:58.90]Some of the best chefs in the world will tell you that the best barbecue is in America.
[56:02.16]Of course it is.
[56:03.08]It has to be.
[56:05.46]What country does barbecue better than America?
[56:08.20]I'm sorry.
[56:09.10]Like, we're like, oh, America is popcorn!
[56:11.38]But I'm going to defend America when I need to.
[56:13.80]Like, fucking barbecue, American barbecue is better than anywhere else on the planet.
[56:19.01]Like, what are you talking about?
[56:20.75]Come on.
[56:23.31]He's a patriot.
[56:25.20]I like eating smoked meat.
[56:31.26]I need the dough.
[56:57.03]Americans get some really good food.
[57:00.72]I mean, yes, you could eat like chicken tenders and like Pizza Hut every day, but like I mean, that's like the joke right like Americans They eat fucking a pizza on hot dogs and mac and cheese.
[57:12.29]I mean they do we do I do
[57:25.10]How long does this need to be?
[57:26.70]How long does this need to be?
[57:31.72]Is it too long?
[57:34.12]What was I making?
[57:36.34]What was that?
[57:37.32]I don't even know what that was.
[57:42.17]Oh, it's supposed to be spaghetti.
[57:48.35]That would be one giant tube of spaghetti.
[57:52.52]Okay.
[57:53.64]Make some pasta.
[57:54.50]When the pasta is flowing from the pasta machine, reaches the length of the line, shake the Wiimote to cut the pasta.
[58:01.34]Alright, so cut it when it gets... This looks like fun.
[58:18.57]Is this hard to do?
[58:22.27]Alright, you know why I want to make my own pasta?
[58:24.01]Because you guys remember the Play-Doh playset where you did this same exact thing except it wasn't pasta, it was Play-Doh?
[58:30.44]But it wasn't supposed to be pasta, you just smushed Play-Doh through a machine that turned it into this for no reason?
[58:36.24]That's why I want to make this.
[58:44.79]Childhood.
[58:46.13]Inspiration.
[58:50.63]You grew up at Toys R Us.
[58:52.01]A lot of people did.
[58:53.97]Alright, rotate the Wiimote, so we're gonna stew this again.
[58:56.87]I've had some experience stewing.
[59:01.21]Get a little bit of salt.
[59:07.27]Get that heat up.
[59:10.86]More stirring.
[59:15.90]This is just really easy Guitar Hero.
[59:24.22]Ster the pasta, dammit, I did!
[59:25.62]They had really good- wait, what?
[59:33.40]What was mushy and gross?
[59:35.52]Alright, drain the pasta.
[59:37.67]Go like this.
[59:39.55]Tilt the pot to drain.
[59:41.39]Carefully you tilt too much it'll spill and you'll like burn mama's hands again.
[59:53.84]That was it?
[59:59.60]That's all the pasta that was in the fucking bowl?
[60:04.06]What?
[60:05.68]What?
[60:06.42]Get your hand in there!
[60:07.74]Get it out!
[60:14.26]Okay, prepare.
[60:16.25]Move the Wiimote in the direction of the arrow to prepare the ingredients.
[60:34.29]Ugh!
[60:39.05]Look at the bridge's head off!
[60:44.57]I'm sorry.
[60:47.04]Anything that has a slimy outside... I would not ever eat.
[60:52.94]I know, I'm sorry.
[60:54.14]Octopus get disgusting.
[60:56.12]Squid disgusting.
[60:58.53]They're like slimy, tendril aliens.
[61:02.11]No.
[61:02.71]Never.
[61:04.35]I'm sorry.
[61:05.29]I... Why do people eat that?
[61:13.53]It's squid.
[61:14.67]It's octopus.
[61:15.33]No.
[61:15.77]No.
[61:16.23]And their legs.
[61:17.87]If you eat octopus legs, they have the suction cups and they're long and they're like... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[61:26.26]No, no, no, no.
[61:27.40]Never.
[61:35.26]I just, like, imagine it, like, like, sucking in my lip, and maybe, like, it's on my lip!
[61:39.80]It's on my fucking lip!
[61:41.29]And, like, Cam has to reach over and, like, pull it off!
[61:44.45]Oh, I can't get it off!
[61:46.13]Oh, no.
[61:46.55]I don't want it.
[61:49.22]I don't want it.
[62:03.04]Why does a squid turn into onion rings when you cut it up?
[62:05.44]No, that's gross.
[62:06.78]Weird.
[62:08.60]Squid, when you, it's just like little weird slimy wristbands.
[62:12.84]That take, that you chew through like rubber.
[62:28.34]Garlic, you're speaking like, that's it?
[62:33.59]Calamari yeah sure okay.
[62:35.19]I will eat a piece of calamari and be like oh That's mmm That was good.
[62:43.05]That was kind of good.
[62:43.71]It was a little salty I but when people pick up
[62:48.22]When people pick up the fucking piece of calamari.
[62:51.78]That's... Like when you launch a grenade launcher at an alien in a fucking video game.
[62:57.15]And it's like spread out and all fucking... Like it looks like this.
[63:00.81]Looks like that and it's fried up.
[63:02.65]Mm-mm.
[63:03.33]Nope.
[63:03.67]And it's like the legs... Nope.
[63:12.89]Can't handle squid.
[63:13.95]No, why?
[63:14.43]I just don't eat it.
[63:15.01]I don't want it.
[63:16.86]How long does this take to cook?
[63:18.02]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright!
[63:28.35]Stop, stop, stop!
[63:29.21]That was the squid ink!
[63:34.05]The taste buds of a child.
[63:35.19]A lot of people don't like fucking squid or octopus.
[63:47.38]Why would you want to eat squid ink?
[63:51.21]That's just something that humans decided they were going to eat because they decided that they thought it would be cool to eat it one day.
[63:58.01]Like, what's the point of this?
[64:08.34]It tastes.
[64:08.98]It's tasty.
[64:09.86]I don't agree.
[64:10.52]I've never had it, though.
[64:21.11]I'm gonna-
[67:11.41]I'll be back in an hour with the squid.
[67:17.74]No, you know what it is for me?
[67:18.70]Here's what it is.
[67:21.26]It's welcome to our restaurant.
[67:22.68]We put squid ink on this to make it so we can charge that plate of food like 30 more dollars.
[67:28.80]That's what it is.
[67:29.36]I'm being scammed.
[67:40.99]Being scammed.
[67:43.19]Does he hate to see people get scammed?
[67:46.34]Let's make some pierogies.
[67:53.62]More egg cracking.
[67:54.48]I'll get it.
[67:59.45]Perfect.
[68:00.01]Just like that.
[68:00.59]Again.
[68:03.25]It was identical.
[68:04.65]Run that clip back and watch it.
[68:13.99]I went to the bathroom.
[68:14.73]Did I tell you I was going to the bathroom?
[68:18.31]Wait, it didn't say where I was going?
[68:23.09]Wait, what are you talking about?
[68:27.12]Oh, it's my voice is delayed by a thousand milliseconds.
[68:31.76]So when I say something right here, you hear it a full second later.
[68:35.46]So I said, hey, I'm going to the bathroom.
[68:36.77]Be right back.
[68:37.27]And I muted.
[68:37.71]So you didn't hear that.
[68:41.81]Oh.
[68:43.01]I muted too quickly for you to get the aw- Okay.
[68:44.97]Let me think about these.
[68:47.19]These are getting long, huh?
[68:49.45]They look nice, though.
[68:50.41]Like, they actually are, like, very healthy nails.
[68:52.68]They're very healthy.
[68:54.82]Too healthy.
[68:55.34]They grow like a weed.
[68:59.18]I club them once a fucking week, and they just keep going.
[69:08.29]Blades!
[69:09.22]What's next?
[69:09.81]Alright.
[69:10.59]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[69:11.19]Put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down!
[69:16.41]Sell the clippings.
[69:18.79]I can't think of anything more disgusting than what you just said, except for maybe eat squid ink pasta.
[69:25.16]No, no, no, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
[69:35.51]Wonderful!
[69:37.01]Better than Mama.
[69:38.15]It's great.
[69:40.73]Pipey.
[69:44.53]Alright, meat is dough.
[69:46.46]Are we making squid ink pasta again?
[69:54.18]Getting better.
[69:59.85]A little bit.
[70:03.94]I want his points, Beck.
[70:05.82]Where's the boomer brace?
[70:09.91]I haven't been wearing it lately.
[70:11.47]It's been constricting me and making me a little sore.
[70:15.39]Oh, let's shake the pierogies.
[70:16.47]Okay.
[70:18.17]They have to shape them.
[70:22.21]Okay, get it.
[70:29.16]When am I done shaping it?
[70:40.65]No, no, other way, other way.
[70:43.51]Stop going the other way!
[70:44.39]You can't go faster than this, guys.
[70:48.49]The snow goes faster!
[71:07.13]Why does he look so upset?
[71:10.51]I think that's just my face.
[71:12.48]A little more.
[71:33.48]Preston boomer face.
[71:36.67]Alright, stretch the dough.
[71:43.97]Move it forward and backward to stretch the dough.
[71:47.07]Rotate dough with one and two.
[71:50.10]Okay.
[71:51.48]We gotta make it- spread it out.
[71:53.34]One and two.
[71:59.29]Perfect.
[72:15.09]Careful, careful.
[72:26.71]I finally chopped.
[72:30.50]Do you know how to do this?
[72:33.23]Pierogies are awesome.
[72:33.87]I love pierogies.
[72:36.79]My mother used to make pierogies all the time.
[72:44.53]Seems like too much onion.

[74:31.91]Okay, so we're just gonna go Excuse me, where are the gloves?
[74:43.82]Now I don't eat food prepared by anybody unless they're using rubber cleaning gloves Awesome

[74:59.32]Do not mine!
[75:00.04]Alright, I know, I didn't do enough meat.
[75:01.94]Let's do, okay, we'll compensate with more meat.

[76:28.72]Uh, it seems like you have only one pierogi on your plate, judges.
[76:33.49]Yeah, uh, Jerma.
[76:35.27]You just wasted, like, $40 worth of food.
[76:37.37]Have you ever used a stove before?
[76:48.65]I don't know.
[76:55.05]I've never actually used a stove before.
[76:57.35]Uh, this looks... I don't want this.
[77:01.08]It's like tapeworm stew.
[77:02.28]I don't want it.
[77:03.68]Uh, what is that?
[77:04.26]No.
[77:04.86]What is that?

[77:18.26]Hand-fried lobster.
[77:20.98]Cream puffs!
[77:21.54]Those are awesome.
[77:24.28]What is this?
[77:24.72]Actually, mussels are pretty good.
[77:28.04]I eat mussels once.
[77:35.38]Oh, fuck.
[77:35.74]I didn't look at the instructions.
[77:42.03]They're open!
[77:44.43]They're done!
[77:51.13]I thought when the shell opens it means it's cooked, right?
[77:55.33]Isn't that what it means?
[77:59.37]Yes.
[78:02.64]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[78:03.86]So what was wrong with that?
[78:04.76]The shell opened.
[78:08.44]When they open up, pick them up with B and move them to the tray.
[78:10.98]So what the fuck?
[78:29.21]Are you gonna overcook this shit?
[78:34.55]When they open that, how is that wrong?
[78:44.92]Food poisoning.
[78:49.80]It said when they pop open, move them to the tray.
[79:02.39]They opened!
[79:08.92]They opened!
[79:09.48]I did wait!
[79:10.86]It said, take it please!
[79:22.45]Look!
[79:33.65]Just literally wait for the arrow.
[79:42.45]I did!
[79:42.81]Okay, this one's done.
[79:45.34]This one's done.
[79:45.84]Now this one's done.
[79:46.56]Okay, mine were done too.
[79:48.72]That's horseshit.
[79:49.82]Mine were done.
[79:50.28]I didn't have an arrow on it.
[79:53.70]Yeah, my last dish was better than yours too.
[80:01.48]No, they weren't.
[80:01.92]Yes, they were.
[80:02.56]Don't criticize the streamer.
[80:04.46]That was Vince.
[80:40.38]How long am I gonna play this for?
[80:44.65]I have a shitload of Wii games back here, so... I'm enjoying myself.
[80:49.13]I think it's fun.
[80:59.96]Dedicated cooking mama stream?
[81:13.15]No, I don't like squids.
[81:14.07]Squids are, like, weird.
[81:16.51]I don't like squids either.
[81:19.29]Oh!
[81:21.04]Oh!
[81:22.90]Oh!
[81:39.79]I think you're ripping off the thing's fucking legs!
[81:41.91]I don't like it.
[81:43.43]I can't- I- I- I'm- I'm never eating meat ever again.
[81:47.01]I don't know, I like- I- I- It freaks me out sometimes.
[81:50.35]He's gonna puke.
[81:53.24]That's bullshit.
[81:55.10]Alright, it- Oh!
[81:58.18]Wait!
[81:58.54]Okay?
[82:17.00]All done.
[82:17.32]Let's get a couple of good ones.
[82:22.91]Alright.
[82:23.25]Alright.
[82:23.51]Come on.
[82:23.79]Come on.
[82:24.07]Come on.
[82:24.37]Squid.
[82:24.63]Come on.
[82:24.97]Squid.
[82:25.27]Perfect.
[82:25.57]Steam the rice.
[82:29.43]Okay.
[82:30.49]Not in a different...
[82:46.98]What is that?
[82:51.44]Why is it doing this?
[82:55.20]What?
[82:57.10]Oh, shit.
[82:57.85]Okay, I got it.
[83:00.63]Oh, is this sake?
[83:03.79]I love sake.
[83:04.37]Sake's great.
[83:05.87]Alright, let's make paellas.
[83:09.87]The paella, not the paellas.
[83:12.24]You don't, like, wrap them up.
[83:15.93]Arrange them as you'd like.
[83:17.10]Alright, let's arrange them as we'd like.
[83:20.04]So, let's, uh...
[83:44.72]What?
[83:45.12]It was fine!
[84:10.07]I did that because you want to get some broth first, and then you pick the stuff off the top that you want.
[84:17.13]I make my paella buffet style.
[84:24.53]And oh, it's delicious when I make it.
[84:29.26]Look, if you ever come over, I'll make it for you.
[84:33.36]It'll be like .
[84:34.02]Oh yeah, and then we'll go have a steak.
[84:39.59]New recipe.
[84:41.22]Alright, shrimp and chili sauce.
[84:45.22]That sounds pretty good.
[84:46.12]Ooh.
[84:47.66]Alright, should I make the cream puffs?
[84:49.78]Wait, what else is there?
[84:52.76]How about a good old-fashioned American hot dog?
[84:56.57]Yeah, we gotta make some American food.
[84:57.99]I know that there's like a shitload of Europeans in here that are like, ugh.
[85:04.37]Let's watch.
[85:18.65]The sophistication of American cuisine.
[85:23.35]Watch as I use the knife to slice the bread down the middle.
[85:31.01]Watch as I put hot dog into bun.
[85:38.88]Outside, apparently.
[85:49.62]What the fuck is this?
[85:57.79]How much of this do I have to put on?
[85:59.13]I don't want this much cheese on my hot dog!
[86:21.90]Decorate it!
[86:23.24]This is American cuisine!
[86:25.74]Make a hot dog and then be at the fucking Fridays where the placemat is a four-year-old and draw with a crayon all over the placemat.
[86:44.49]Oh, this is ketchup and mustard.
[86:52.28]Okay, that's a mustard- that's a mustard sandwich?
[87:05.37]With a handle that's a hot dog.
[87:09.21]You pick that up by the hot dog and eat that.
[87:21.05]That's a reverse coin dog.
[87:30.50]Double cheeseburger!
[87:31.96]American!
[87:33.76]We're doing all the American stuff first, because I'm American.
[87:36.02]And I'm gonna tell you how correct it is.
[87:38.76]It's a double cheeseburger.
[87:39.82]Why does it have to be a double?
[87:42.36]Why does it have to be a double?
[87:43.84]I don't get it.
[87:46.22]Why can't it just be one single cheeseburger?
[87:47.94]What, are you saying that all Americans eat McDouble cheeseburgers?
[87:50.95]McDoubles?
[87:51.53]Every time they go to the restaurant?
[87:55.15]We do.
[87:55.77]You all do.
[87:56.19]When was the last time anyone ordered a single hamburger from, like, McDonald's?
[88:01.33]I mean, like a regular just cheeseburger.
[88:04.87]I'm not even sure they make those anymore.
[88:06.45]Because people don't order them anymore.
[88:09.78]That's a special order now, to get a single cheeseburger.
[88:13.36]You have to, like, pull around and park in one of the parking spaces.
[88:16.04]Because they're not fucking ready for that.
[88:19.48]Alright, let's see what we got.
[88:22.58]What do we got?
[88:23.06]What kind of veggies we got in here?
[88:24.12]I'll tell you how accurate this is.
[88:26.80]Buns.
[88:29.24]Okay.
[88:31.28]Slice the tomato.
[88:32.46]No tomato on mine, please.
[88:35.79]Yes, please give me something that makes everything wet and acidic while I bite into it.
[88:40.53]Disgusting.
[88:41.25]Get it off my hamburger.
[88:42.11]Here are the lettuce.
[88:45.59]Ah!
[88:46.05]What, did I break my finger?
[89:10.09]Why do we have to do this?
[89:11.03]Why don't we use the pieces?
[89:12.47]Is it like something in the center?
[89:14.23]Can we take all that lettuce off to get to the center of the lettuce?
[89:19.75]Eat the center of the lettuce.
[89:24.79]Make the meat.
[89:25.47]Alright, I'm very, very American because I looked at this and went, what the fuck are they talking about?
[89:32.90]Just go to grocery store, get patty, and put patty in pans.
[89:46.84]I'm also gonna make quite a few hamburgers.
[89:49.74]Uh, looks like the whole baseball team is coming over, Mama.
[89:53.50]Because this is like, this is like 15 hamburgers.
[89:57.04]Eggs.
[89:58.78]Oh, right.
[90:00.23]It's a binder.
[90:01.13]It's a binder.
[90:21.69]We got more than two free eggs to make.
[90:24.11]That seems like a lot.
[90:27.44]One hit.
[90:30.26]Good.
[90:30.86]I messed up one this time.
[90:37.04]Perfect record there.
[90:38.82]Perfect record.
[90:41.15]The burger is not a meatball, you savage.
[90:46.95]Time to grate the cheese!
[90:49.11]Okay, grate the cheese.
[90:53.14]Like this?
[90:54.40]Why does it want me to do it like this?
[90:56.06]Seems weird.
[90:57.54]Alright, grate the cheese.
[91:24.66]Do it again.
[91:25.22]I do it every time and I love it because the cheese is so... The cheese is so soft when you do that.
[91:32.51]If you grate a fresh block of Parmesan, the cheese is so soft and almost moist.
[91:39.03]And when you pick it up, it just bunches together and it's so... I love Parmesan cheese.
[91:43.73]It's like my favorite.
[91:44.85]I love hard cheese.
[91:45.57]I'm a hard cheese guy.
[91:46.85]Not a soft cheese guy.
[91:48.55]Brie sucks.
[91:50.05]Okay?
[91:51.11]Hard cheese, yes.
[91:52.31]Soft cheese, get it out of here.
[91:54.57]I'm a hard cheese guy.
[91:58.95]I'm just telling you how I feel.
[92:03.94]Why is it so dirty?
[92:04.66]Why are there like bugs in the restaurant?
[92:09.16]Nutmeg.
[92:10.48]Pecker.
[92:13.38]Mama, why are you making me guess?
[92:17.21]Mama, I appreciate the fact that you're using one of those old toys from the fucking early 90s that had you take the magnet and give the guy a beard, but get it off my screen, please!
[92:33.33]Need the dough.
[92:47.71]Hamburger dough.
[92:51.02]Need the hamburger dough.
[92:52.66]Alright, make a hamburger.
[92:59.68]Hold the B button to take a piece of hamburger, then hold the Wiimote upright to move left and right to shape the meat.
[93:07.13]Alright.
[93:08.17]This is a long one.
[93:08.83]So, grab some meat.
[93:12.99]Upright.
[93:18.94]That's not- that's not how I've ever done that.
[93:21.60]It seems- am I- am I making a pizza?
[93:31.22]That's not how you do this.
[93:38.17]If my mother ever saw me doing this in the kitchen, she would come and grab my arm and be like, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[93:54.14]Why am I playing this?
[94:01.92]Because it's a fucking game.
[94:04.30]Because, uh, my Chibi-Robo got fucked up because I don't have a... I have a corrupted GameCube.
[94:09.97]You know what?
[94:10.33]Let's just say I started with this.
[94:11.89]Alright, water time.
[94:14.59]Awesome!
[94:24.62]Come on, get it.
[94:28.41]Get it.
[94:28.71]Come on.
[94:32.19]Okay, just forget the first hour of your life here.
[94:35.37]Alright, time to pan fry.
[94:38.33]Turn over, move.
[94:41.02]Forward and back.
[94:42.20]Shake.
[94:44.12]Adjust the heat.
[94:45.30]Oh, fuck.
[94:45.76]I have to make the patty.
[94:46.76]Why does it look like this?
[94:48.00]Why is it in half?
[94:55.58]Turn forward and back to move to flip it.
[94:59.12]Shake it, and then adjust the heat while holding A. Shake it.
[95:01.48]Turn it over.
[95:05.79]Put it on medium.
[95:06.79]Turn it down to low.
[95:08.93]Flip the patty over again.
[95:24.82]Put it back on medium heat.
[95:28.24]Flip it over again.
[95:31.40]This is huge!
[95:34.88]Who is this hamburger for?
[95:37.15]This hamburger is a pancake!
[95:39.17]I don't know who's gonna eat this!
[95:40.79]This is a challenge burger!
[95:42.89]This is not a hamburger that you eat in a restaurant!
[95:47.57]Choose freely!
[95:48.43]Alright, let's make my ultimate hamburger.
[95:53.01]Are you ready?
[95:57.62]Okay.
[95:58.32]We're doing cheese down first.
[96:01.12]Then patty.
[96:02.40]Then two slices of cheese.
[96:04.56]Then patty.
[96:05.78]Then lettuce.
[96:07.91]Then... Uh, the pickles.
[96:10.55]Get them off.
[96:11.13]No, no, no, no.
[96:12.33]I don't like pickles.
[96:13.33]That's it.
[96:14.75]And then, where's mayonnaise?
[96:16.51]Where's mayo?
[96:16.89]A little bit of mayo and then a little bit of, um... That's done.
[96:19.45]I'm done.
[96:24.24]There were no onions.
[96:30.19]No, I would do some fresh chopped raw onions, too.
[96:33.61]Or maybe some cooked caramelized onions.
[96:35.61]They were available, but they were not.
[96:39.28]That's... Okay, there was a little bit of mayonnaise on that.
[96:41.34]And there was some caramelized onions.
[96:44.84]I want to eat that right now.
[96:52.45]Wait, I told you it was caramelized or not caramelized.
[96:55.43]I'd like it either way.
[96:59.18]Oh, you know what?
[97:01.02]Listen to this.
[97:02.30]That was unavailable.
[97:03.60]Get rid of the lettuce.
[97:05.04]Hear me?
[97:05.32]Get rid of the lettuce.
[97:07.48]Mushrooms.
[97:08.70]Sauteed mushrooms on top of that.
[97:10.69]A little bit of fucking... A little bit of A1 steak sauce on top of the bun.
[97:16.21]That's good.

[98:45.34]Or just some Swiss cheese, a little bit of mayo.
[98:48.36]Mushroom.
[98:48.78]A mushroom in Swiss hamburger, guys, is incredibly common and very popular.
[98:52.95]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[98:55.82]A Swiss cheese and mushroom hamburger.
[98:58.42]It's on every menu at every restaurant you've ever been to that serves more than three different kinds of hamburgers.
[99:04.65]What?
[99:05.07]Where are you guys from?
[99:05.89]Fucking Mars?
[99:15.40]Dude, I'll go even a step further.
[99:17.50]I'll go a step further.
[99:18.24]You want me to go a step further?
[99:19.30]I will.
[99:20.72]I'm one of those guys that I would be totally happy if you gave me just sauteed mushrooms with butter.
[99:29.34]I would just eat the fuck out of them.
[99:31.44]Sauteed mushrooms and onions with butter.
[99:35.35]I would just eat that, and I would be happy.
[99:39.35]They're so unbelievably delicious.
[99:42.81]Sautéed mushrooms in butter is un-fucking-bearably delicious.
[99:49.31]I can't even imagine somebody that would disagree with that.
[99:53.91]Those of you that get it, imagine, like, right when you're done sautéing and they're in the butter, the mushrooms, and you take that fork full and you just taste it to make sure you've got it right.
[100:02.97]Imagine not liking that and not thinking that was, like, the top of a list.
[100:06.56]Can you imagine being that person?
[100:20.46]I'm that guy that sounds awful?
[100:21.93]It's, it's so, it's like, so good.
[100:25.17]Hold on, there's a cattle.
[100:27.19]Mushroom crew.
[100:28.39]He's preaching?
[100:44.53]Beets are okay.
[100:47.88]I don't like to eat beets.
[100:48.96]I like to drink beets.
[100:50.00]They kind of taste like dirt.
[100:58.45]A nice beet salad, though?
[101:00.79]It's okay.
[101:02.35]But beet, blend it in with like another juice or something like as a base.
[101:06.29]I like beet juice.
[101:07.49]I think it's okay.
[101:08.65]I'm not a big fan of people that drive by 100 miles per hour by next to the house.
[101:13.24]I'm really not a fan of that.
[101:23.46]What do I feel about borscht?
[101:25.22]I've never had it actually.
[101:27.10]I've never eaten this.
[101:27.92]It looks like it'll be alright.
[101:33.72]Beat salad?
[101:34.22]Yeah, beat salad's good.
[101:37.10]Alright, I'll get this one right now.
[101:46.74]White powder?
[101:47.86]What is white powder?
[101:50.28]White powder?
[101:51.06]What is that?
[101:51.54]What's going on?
[101:57.32]Hello?
[101:57.54]What's going on?
[101:57.96]Why isn't anything blinking?
[101:59.04]Do I have to shake?
[102:02.00]What happened?
[102:06.01]Mama, tell me!
[102:07.35]Mama, tell me what you want!
[102:10.56]Mama!
[102:12.54]You can't stare at me, Mama.
[102:14.46]Mama!
[102:15.82]Mama!
[102:18.84]It didn't crash?
[102:19.78]The timer's still going.
[102:20.92]This is where Mama goes.
[102:24.90]Oh, sorry.
[102:26.23]She puts her phone down on the fucking table and it's like, Mom.
[102:30.23]I'm here for you.
[102:37.01]Remove the foam.
[102:41.26]Hold the V button while pulling upward and lift the foam?
[102:55.61]What is, what is this?
[102:56.33]Bacteria?
[103:00.01]Oh no, no, Borch is awesome, Jeremy.
[103:01.95]You just have to remove the mold that cooks off.
[103:12.70]It's fat from the meat?
[103:13.60]I know.
[103:14.12]I know who it is.
[103:16.06]Thank you, uh, for taking the bait.
[103:22.26]Thank you.
[103:22.62]Alright, let's do it.
[103:24.20]He doesn't know.
[103:24.78]Shh.
[103:46.82]I was really pretending the whole time Can I put this in?
[104:02.24]How about a little bit of this?
[104:04.95]Yeah, some laurel Next goes in the blood They have a blood soup without blood
[104:16.89]and then the cabbage here are the beets set it and forget it there's blood in the borscht
[104:45.51]I'd probably try it.
[104:46.23]It looks like it would be alright.
[104:53.28]This is not even how you make horse.
[104:55.22]I think it's close enough.
[104:58.24]What are those?
[104:59.76]Potato-tots?
[105:01.92]Tater-tots.
[105:03.70]Tater...
[105:12.42]Chicken Kiev.
[105:12.94]Uh, yeah.
[105:15.08]Wait, is this like Chicken Cordon Bleu?
[105:18.10]Is this like a crust filled with ham and chicken and cheese and stuff?
[105:21.78]That was pretty good.
[105:22.52]I like Chicken Cordon Bleu.
[105:24.50]Alright, mince meat.
[105:36.29]I love Chicken Cordon Bleu.
[105:38.03]It's so good.
[105:40.73]This is human skin.
[105:45.37]Why did you say that and why did I read that?
[105:51.91]Butter, salt.
[105:57.41]That was easy.
[106:00.61]It's basically chicken nuggets.
[106:02.75]God damn you, I'm fasting.
[106:14.08]It's supposed to be cheaper, Yorobo.
[106:15.26]I know.
[106:15.60]I'm sorry.
[106:17.64]I know.
[106:22.06]It will be tomorrow.
[106:24.00]I will buy, like, ten different memory cards.
[106:29.48]And an SD card.
[106:30.80]I'll have them all connected at the same time to make sure it works.
[106:37.99]Alright, let's shape it up.
[106:57.93]He's getting disgusting hands all over our chicken nuggets.
[107:02.29]I already winked.
[107:03.25]I just did.
[107:03.95]Oh, that was a big one.
[107:08.97]Wink again.
[107:11.02]These are huge.
[107:28.85]Use your feet to make the nuggets instead of your hands.
[107:33.82]Oh my god!
[107:34.80]This is like a whole breast!
[107:37.12]This is like... Mom or Dad doesn't care anymore.
[107:43.16]Can you make me chicken nuggets?
[107:44.80]Yeah, sure.
[107:46.87]Here.

[109:48.30]Steam it a little bit.
[109:49.54]Drizzle that on some eggs or some toast.
[109:51.32]You got yourself a fucking fake Eggs Benedict.
[109:53.96]Alright, bread the chicken.
[110:13.89]Alright, this is kind of ridiculous.
[110:21.95]Okay, not done.

[110:58.08]I got a super score on that one.
[111:04.12]Deep fry.
[111:04.78]When they're fully cooked, grab them with the B button.
[111:09.33]Alright, we're gonna do it one at a time.
[111:17.51]Three times is fine.
[111:18.19]Okay, so let's increase the heat a little bit.

[111:44.97]I gotta get at least one.
[111:46.39]Otherwise the judges are gonna fucking kill me.
[111:59.94]Mine didn't look like that.
[112:11.93]These look kind of good.
[112:14.47]I would eat these.
[112:16.98]These actually look pretty good.
[112:20.04]I feel like this would be like cutting into these.
[112:21.58]You get the moist chicken with the crunchy outside.
[112:23.44]What is this over here though?
[112:26.00]What's this moss?
[112:27.18]What is that?

[114:14.70]Do you know one of my favorite snacks was growing up?
[114:16.18]Take a celery stalk, like the boat inside the boat of the celery, cut off the ends, right?
[114:24.65]And smear peanut butter down the middle, inside the little crevice, inside the boat section.
[114:29.59]I loved it.
[114:30.23]Celery peanut butter in the celery boat.
[114:34.10]That's pretty good.
[114:39.18]Yeah, no, it is good.
[114:41.28]It's a good snack.

[115:45.01]Alright, when the oil reaches the correct temperature, add ingredients.
[115:49.65]Pilt them to coat them in the oil.
[115:52.01]Quickly coat twice, then finish.
[115:58.32]Alright, get them out!
[116:10.13]What?
[116:10.63]Quickly coat them twice and then pull them out!
[116:13.63]quickly coat twice and then finish.
[116:16.75]I'm just, okay, look, it may have been raw, but I'm following the direction.
[116:22.52]If that was on the back of like the blue apron card, quickly coat twice and then take them out, I'd be like, okay, idiot, I just follow the instructions.
[116:31.86]I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[116:33.18]Alright, sorry, I can cook them right here.
[116:43.41]They're gonna cook right here anyway.
[116:45.41]We'll put them in for a little bit longer.
[116:54.70]There we go, and that chili sauce.
[116:58.90]Alright.
[116:59.90]Come on, shrimp.
[117:01.52]They cooked in here.
[117:02.27]That's fine.
[117:02.87]Why'd I have to cook them twice?
[117:03.95]Wonderful.
[117:07.25]Better than Mama.
[117:11.78]I'm gonna mix squid ink in with your peanut butter.
[117:23.59]Did he ever apologize to mama?
[117:25.27]Yeah, like two hours ago.
[117:26.27]Where have you been?

[117:50.66]I love crab.
[117:57.70]So this went from it's a Chibi-Robo stream to everybody get hungry watching me play a 20-year-old cooking game.
[118:17.13]Ster-fried crab.
[118:19.51]I think I don't want that.
[118:23.47]The Wii is such a fun system.
[118:24.95]Like, what a fun system this was.
[118:26.43]I just wish the memory card worked.
[118:30.49]Sorry, we're past it.
[118:31.37]Alright, shake the Wii mode up and down to chop the ingredients.
[118:40.12]Damn, that's it?
[118:42.54]This is chunky.
[118:55.58]The SD card will work?
[118:56.82]Yeah, I'll make sure this is ready to go.
[118:59.28]I'll make sure of it by tomorrow.
[119:01.90]Alright, cut up the pieces.
[119:04.64]A lot of ginger.
[119:05.36]It is kind of a lot of ginger.
[119:07.70]Whoa, alright.
[119:16.17]Cutting all the legs off?
[119:18.63]Alright, come on.
[119:20.39]Now what?
[119:22.15]That's it?
[119:22.63]This kills the crab.
[119:24.09]No.
[119:25.12]No.
[119:26.48]I don't think so.
[119:28.84]What are you talking- Alright.
[119:47.33]Same thing.
[119:48.01]Oil, we... ...coat them in the oil, quickly coat them twice, and then finish.

[120:03.78]You're not mine!
[120:07.78]Ah, what?!
[120:08.23]I'll care for you!
[120:12.23]I- What?
[120:12.99]How you can't cook a fucking crab like that?
[120:15.47]You don't just put it in hot oil and take it out.

[153:50.17]That's not a joke!
[153:51.98]You have salivary glands!
[153:53.42]Wonderful!
[153:55.30]Better than Mama!
[153:57.90]We can't talk science in this chat room?
[154:00.00]Why not?
[154:06.12]You're a dog.
[154:09.50]No, I'm being real.
[154:12.52]Good job!
[154:17.80]Do not mind.
[154:23.11]I'm just trying to pull.
[154:25.48]Pull the fucking thing.
[154:30.40]I believe science.
[154:31.60]I believe in the science of God.
[154:33.16]Alright, I gotta make this.
[154:36.45]I gotta make my taco.
[154:39.35]Look at that JPEG.
[154:44.01]Ugh!
[154:44.67]No!
[154:52.53]Okay, you're making... We're not at Subway, okay?
[154:56.95]This is not how many cheese triangles I would put in.
[154:59.69]Okay, uh, where's the meat?
[155:06.85]Where's the meat?
[155:07.49]Where's the onions?
[155:11.86]Why can't I just put it in?
[155:24.32]That's too... That's a joke.
[155:32.64]That's a, that's a, I have a friend that works at Subway.
[155:37.05]And, yeah, don't worry about it.
[155:38.89]I'll give you like six more triangles.
[155:53.87]What am I even looking at right here?
[155:56.93]I can't even tell what that is.
[155:58.13]Alright, what do we now do?
[156:00.63]Alright, we gotta do this, uh, this tofu dish.
[156:05.27]No meat.
[156:06.08]Oh my god.
[156:19.84]That's a lot of chopping.
[156:23.14]How close am I to the Wii Sensor Bar?
[156:25.54]Um, it is right here.
[156:30.95]Right there.
[156:31.81]Is that bad?
[156:33.37]Should I pull back a little?
[156:37.33]Tofu.
[156:37.99]The flavored soap.
[156:52.88]Of the culinary world.
[157:04.38]It has radiation.
[157:12.30]Everything- what is all this?
[157:14.98]Wasn't I doing tofu?
[157:17.30]This is tofu!
[157:21.00]Wait, why are we- wha-
[157:24.77]This is like three times more meat than tofu.
[157:33.90]That's not a cube meat.
[157:40.01]So we're doing tofu and meat?
[157:41.81]What kind of meat was that?
[157:42.69]There's minced pork.
[157:51.90]Alright, take that out.
[157:52.60]Alright, come on.
[157:59.63]Come on, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook.
[158:02.13]Alright, take it out.
[158:05.66]Cutting the meat with the tofu.
[158:07.66]Alright, now stew the Mapo tofu.
[158:20.85]In goes the spicy miso bean sauce More red chili paste Really crank it Soy sauce Let it simmer a little bit
[158:48.00]Then we add salt, or is this garlic powder?
[158:50.16]Onion powder?
[158:50.64]Potato starch.
[158:53.06]I did it.
[158:59.02]I did it.
[158:59.30]What does tofu taste like?
[159:04.11]Whatever you decided to put on it.
[159:07.95]You can make it taste like pretty much anything.
[159:10.23]That's why I said it's the flavored soap of the culinary world.
[159:13.93]Uh-oh.
[159:20.47]New recipe.
[159:22.79]Ooh, what are those?
[159:23.49]Dumplings?
[159:24.75]I love dumplings.
[159:26.25]I love dumplings.
[159:29.04]I love dumplings.
[159:31.86]Oh, they're pork buns.
[159:33.08]Okay.
[159:33.44]Oh, but still.
[159:36.18]Pork dumplings seriously are, like,
[159:42.52]There's this place in Paris.
[159:44.52]I forget the name of the restaurant, but there's a place in Paris that does... They have a cart that moves by in Paris.
[159:48.95]No, no, no.
[159:49.31]Hold on.
[159:52.53]Paris Casino in Vegas.
[159:55.33]Not like I went to Paris and had steamed pork buns.
[159:58.94]There's a place in Paris that does really, really good steamed dumplings.
[160:10.49]Yeah, I got the best dumplings ever in Paris, France.
[160:13.33]Dude, I can't... This rich streamer goes to France.
[160:31.80]No, I went to pretend France in Las Vegas.
[160:38.88]The Paris Resort and Casino.
[160:40.48]They have a dumpling place.
[160:42.27]It's pretty good.
[160:42.87]They have the dumplings.
[160:44.05]They have the pork dumplings.
[160:44.81]The spicy pork dumplings.
[160:45.89]They're fucking phenomenal.
[160:46.75]What's the name of this place?
[160:49.74]I say Hash House or Go-Go every day.
[160:51.34]Like, I might as well say another one.
[161:08.39]Rich streamer eats out regularly on the Las Vegas Strip I've been to this place twice in two years It's not expensive
[161:40.16]Blowing all the bits on dumplings.
[161:43.38]What if I was?
[161:44.02]What if I was blowing all the bits on delicious dumplings?
[161:52.79]What if I was?
[161:57.38]Would you rather I use it on drugs?
[162:02.50]Didn't think so.
[162:10.56]Alright, let's make, we gotta mince this.
[162:17.97]Do a drug test.
[162:30.06]I know a lot of people will be like, Whoa, Pog, let's make him do a drug test!
[162:35.68]I mean, my fucking sodium level might be a little high.
[162:43.10]There's nothing on there.
[162:45.60]Gonna be a lot of X's.
[162:52.80]My, like, cholesterol might be, like, slightly elevated.
[162:55.06]I don't know.
[163:07.89]Slightly.
[163:08.41]I eat pretty healthy, guys.
[163:09.99]I don't eat, like, crap every day.
[163:14.76]I just told you guys about one of my favorite snacks.
[163:16.76]It was peanut butter and celery, and everyone was like, ugh!
[163:21.72]That's a healthy thing to eat.
[163:23.16]That's not healthy.
[163:34.29]Wait, what year is it where peanut butter is not seen as a healthy food right now?
[163:40.11]What planet are we on?
[163:44.24]Peanut butter is... You could fucking literally live on peanut butter.
[163:48.87]You could eat peanut butter and live off of it.
[163:51.53]It's got everything.
[163:54.85]Peanut butter is very... It's not a saturated fat.
[164:05.01]You guys, fat is not bad.
[164:06.41]There are good fats.
[164:08.55]All fat is not bad.
[164:25.45]Who told you this?
[164:27.79]Who told you that that fat was bad?
[164:29.31]Yeah, like, don't drink the fucking grease out of the pan when you're done cooking your hamburger.
[164:37.20]But polyunsaturated, monounsaturated fats are good.
[164:42.60]What doctor are you going to?
[164:46.80]Everybody knows this.
[164:55.64]I'm gonna fuck people fucking with this.
[165:00.16]So many hydrogenated oils.
[165:01.44]Get the real stuff.
[165:02.31]Do not mine.
[165:16.93]Imagine being a doctor.
[165:18.57]I'm not a fucking doctor!
[165:21.33]Real peanut butter is good for you!
[165:23.95]What?
[165:24.35]This is not like, wow, he's... Oh, hold on, I gotta steam these.
[165:33.42]Turn it off!
[165:33.90]Imagine if cooking was this fucking hard.
[165:36.94]Alright, you put it in there for one second and turn it off at the exact moment or you're gonna burn it.
[165:46.49]He's an idiot doctor.
[165:47.57]Mmm, those look good.
[166:01.46]So you want to see how, um, you want to see just how ridiculous Earth is right now.
[166:05.62]And I just, I hurt my hand.
[166:07.48]Accidentally hit it on my desk, you didn't see it.
[166:09.67]I just typed in peanut butter with radiation.
[166:14.08]Get this shit out of here.
[166:21.32]Are peanuts radioactive and do they cause cancer?
[166:24.89]Goo goo!
[166:25.85]Hi!
[166:42.65]I had an x-ray recently.
[166:45.95]Right?
[166:46.37]I ate like 50,000 bananas.
[166:51.19]Or like 200 million bananas.
[167:12.35]I'll never eat that many bananas in my life.
[167:16.07]This is huge!
[167:22.64]Wait, is this tofu or is this a bath towel?
[167:28.40]What's my favorite fruit?
[167:35.72]Kiwis.
[167:36.76]Whoa!
[167:37.22]I put it on- I get that on the wiki!
[167:39.16]I didn't know that!
[167:40.68]Wait, I gotta pay attention.
[167:45.70]That's actually kiwis.
[167:46.56]Kiwis are fucking unbelievable.
[167:49.00]You can't eat a kiwi and not like it.
[167:50.36]It's so sweet.
[167:53.26]When you bite down on the seeds, they're a little bit chewy.
[167:56.58]You get that little snap on the seeds.
[167:59.37]Nothing's better than that.
[168:05.23]Yeah, if you know, you know.
[168:07.25]How many do you think?
[168:13.35]No, I don't eat the- you don't eat the skin?
[168:15.03]I don't eat the skin.
[168:15.81]It's like fuzzy and weird.
[168:25.11]Watermelon?
[168:25.67]Do we- yeah, watermelons are pretty good.
[168:28.55]Watermelon is almost like a dessert fruit, though, because it's- it's just water.
[168:33.51]There's nothing really in- it's just water.
[168:36.28]It's in the fir- it's the first word of the fruit.
[168:39.61]I love it.
[168:40.11]I like watermelon, but you're essentially breathing air when you eat a watermelon.
[168:46.96]Chao Mein?
[168:49.52]Oh, I love Chao Mein.
[169:05.94]BRB.
[169:06.26]I'm gonna stick my head in a watermelon.
[169:08.36]Why?
[169:11.08]Pineapple sucks.
[169:11.82]Pineapple's my second favorite fruit.
[169:14.04]Pineapple has, uh, bromelain in it.
[169:16.10]Like, oh my god, holy shit, I can't believe this guy knows what that is.
[169:19.86]I thought he was just an idiot that didn't know how to knead dough in Cooking Mama.
[169:23.59]It's got bromelain in it.
[169:24.63]It's good for you.
[169:26.95]I don't eat too much pineapple, though.
[169:32.64]Because the same thing that's good for you actually is like a flesh-eating enzyme.
[169:37.10]Don't eat too much, just enough.
[169:39.20]Ooh.
[169:41.78]Oh!
[169:41.94]Do it!
[169:42.26]Dude, this is sick!
[169:42.90]So why is it all going under the floor?
[170:04.52]Granny Smith apples are guard tier.
[170:05.96]Green apples.
[170:07.26]Green apples are better than red apples.
[170:11.60]Axe.
[170:11.98]Just hit right here.
[170:13.80]Yep.
[170:14.22]Xiaomi?
[170:23.09]Macintosh apples are better than both of them combined.
[170:26.27]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[170:29.71]I'll throw the axe.
[170:30.53]Like, that was wrong.
[170:31.45]Um...
[170:33.23]Macintosh apples are better than Randy Smith apples, but green apples are better than Macintosh apples.
[170:41.59]Okay, that's better.
[170:44.36]I love the little soft Macintosh apples.
[170:47.18]You can just eat them.
[170:47.90]They're so... The flesh is so mushy and so easy to bite through.
[170:52.84]I don't like eating apples because I have to cut them up and carve them up and shit.
[170:58.04]I want to eat it with my hand.
[170:59.24]And a lot of times when I eat an apple, it's like...
[171:03.27]Ow ow ow ow ow ow this hurts.
[171:05.47]This hurts.
[171:07.17]And I use my bottom fucking teeth to like go in harder.
[171:10.41]It hurts.
[171:11.31]I don't want to do that.
[171:18.51]Curry.
[171:18.91]Ooh nice.
[171:20.13]I see a dentist.
[171:22.69]My teeth are in fucking perfect condition.
[171:26.33]You want my teeth?
[171:26.87]You want my x-rays from my dentist?
[171:43.93]It's like releasing your tax returns.
[171:45.51]Let's see the x-rays of your teeth.
[171:47.73]Let's see your teeth returns.
[171:49.78]Alright, let's grate that cheese.
[172:01.54]Ginger, or ginseng, or whatever it is.
[172:14.59]I was doing when I was making the tacos on the spray.
[172:19.67]She'd be going, oh my god, yes!
[172:21.85]Ugh, look at that!
[172:23.41]And loves curry.
[172:23.96]Does she like curry?
[172:26.24]Yeah, I guess.
[172:44.85]Uh, let's put it together.
[172:52.49]Fruit tier list?
[172:53.11]I already did it.
[172:57.15]I did a fruit tier list.
[172:57.97]Human.
[172:58.25]Remake it?
[173:21.55]I'm not gonna remake the list.
[173:24.33]Oh shit, I can do this!
[173:28.23]I'll put the cinnamon in it.
[173:28.89]I didn't know I could do that.
[173:34.12]Get it in the stew.
[173:47.46]Are you depressed?
[173:50.16]No, I just, okay.
[173:53.10]I have deep set eyes.
[173:54.20]Okay?
[173:55.78]Sorry.
[173:57.30]Like, dude, are you angry?
[173:58.55]Is something wrong?
[174:00.29]Why do you look like you're going to swing at me?
[174:02.01]No, I have deep set eyes.
[174:03.75]I can't, what?
[174:06.07]That's what it is.
[174:15.91]There's a shadow cast over my eyes forever.
[174:20.78]And it just makes me look villainous because there's a shadow here because of the lighting.
[174:24.24]If you see me out in person, I look, like, happy.
[174:29.34]I've got deep-set eyes.
[174:37.16]Why do you stream in the dark?
[174:43.97]Do we have to talk about this every stream?
[174:46.91]I start the stream during the day, and during the night time, if I have my webcam's gain up, I'll get blown out.
[175:01.04]Why do we have to keep explaining this?
[175:04.02]And I don't use auto.
[175:12.88]This looks much better.
[175:13.70]I disagree.
[175:20.84]Nice chest here.
[175:24.48]I was going to give the finger to the camera, but I decided not to.
[175:27.52]Because it would be used against me.
[175:31.38]Alright, I fuck this up every time.
[175:40.61]Slowly pour it.
[175:42.41]Right?
[175:42.75]Slowly pour it out, right?
[175:45.75]Okay.
[175:46.35]Slowly pour it.
[175:47.27]I got it.
[175:49.29]Alright, now let's... We have to bake it?
[175:55.36]Steam the rice.
[176:12.87]Let's go.
[176:23.62]What do I think of Cadbury eggs?
[176:30.16]I'll tell you.
[176:39.59]You've never seen the commercial
[177:03.45]Oh, right.
[177:04.27]You guys... You have not seen that.
[177:07.48]Right.
[177:07.68]Cadbury Eggs had a commercial with a bunny rabbit that did a chicken sound like that.
[177:11.38]Exactly like that.
[177:12.30]Um, okay.
[177:17.85]I forget I'm probably 20 years older than half the people in this chatroom.
[177:22.90]Sometimes I forget.
[177:35.64]I'm 25, I never saw that.
[177:36.34]I'm still 10 years older than you.
[177:38.61]I'm a decade older than you.
[177:40.89]Think about that.
[177:42.67]I'm 10 years older than you.
[177:45.21]Look, think of the wisdom that I have that you don't.
[177:50.13]Wait, didn't I just make this?
[178:01.47]Am I making this?
[178:02.33]Am I remaking this?
[178:05.03]Am I?
[178:05.25]I'm doing it.
[178:05.83]I'm doing it again.
[178:08.22]This is a different one.
[178:09.12]Okay.
[178:23.82]Okay, the lamb curry.
[178:24.86]Okay, let's cut it up into pieces.
[178:32.34]I love that sound.
[178:33.58]That, like, shoop, shoop.
[178:40.10]What happened to Chibi-Robo?
[178:44.81]Uh, I got pushed to tomorrow.
[178:46.15]Because, um... The disk was broken.
[178:51.89]I had to return it.
[178:52.59]Like, I got a fucking broken disk.
[178:54.13]I don't know what happened inside the way it broke.
[178:57.69]Ahem.
[178:58.09]Ahem.
[179:00.71]Uh, they might actually, I'll be honest with you, I gotta make sure I prepare that.
[179:07.04]I gotta get that ready to go.
[179:09.14]There cannot be any fucking mistake there.
[179:13.16]I will make sure that that's what we're doing tomorrow.
[179:14.80]No matter what.
[179:19.46]The SD card is a couple of options.
[179:21.10]I just didn't want to do it, like, in the middle of the stream.
[179:22.94]Like, I would have fucked something up and it would have been bad.
[179:40.81]Give me another one.
[179:44.83]Another bullseye.
[179:47.33]Rage quips Chibi-Robo cook.
[179:49.53]Not gonna lie, you be vibin'.
[179:53.23]Uh, someone just gave 20 subs.
[179:56.27]Nocturne.

[180:17.51]Congratulations to those that got the community sub.

[180:28.82]People drop huge sub gifs in here.
[180:33.70]It's kind of crazy.
[180:38.20]Laurel?
[180:38.62]What is Laurel?
[180:41.96]What is Laurel?
[180:43.08]Yanny?
[180:43.80]What is Yanny?
[180:45.84]What are you guys all saying?
[180:48.76]What are you guys doing?
[180:49.94]What is this?
[180:50.96]What is Yanny?
[181:07.64]She's pretending.
[181:09.90]I don't know what that is.
[181:11.42]I don't know what Yanny is.
[181:19.59]It's a joke.
[181:20.83]I'm pretending.
[181:23.63]I don't know what... I'm not pretending.
[181:25.93]I don't know what that is.
[181:26.87]Do you live under a rock?
[181:30.79]I live technically under wood.
[181:37.48]Smartass.
[181:46.17]I don't know what that is.
[181:48.87]Oh, he's a wise guy.
[181:58.25]He knows it sucks.
[182:00.86]Alright, I, I, I, I...
[182:07.44]Yeah, it sucks.
[182:08.04]Whatever.
[182:09.06]I remember watching it when I was younger.
[182:10.92]How am I gonna make this little doll up into something huge?
[182:14.88]Awesome!
[182:16.40]Wonderful!
[182:17.95]Better than Mama!
[182:33.79]This is my favorite game.
[182:35.03]I did not know he was playing it.
[182:36.11]How did I not know I was... Well, because we had to pivot.
[182:39.10]We had to do a hard pivot to this game.
[182:41.24]This is not something I planned on doing today.
[182:45.30]But you're probably really happy to see that it's here.
[182:47.18]Oh, I want it.
[182:50.48]I'll go right now.
[182:52.04]Cilantro, carne asada, green chili sauce.
[182:55.63]Oh, yep.
[182:56.69]We're good.
[182:57.65]We're good.
[183:07.39]Cilantro tastes like soap.
[183:09.75]Um, if you use too much of it, I agree with you.
[183:11.79]I don't like a lot of cilantro.
[183:13.07]I like just enough to get a little bit of that flavor.
[183:15.79]I don't... too much cilantro, it can just... doesn't taste great.
[183:31.51]My father hates cilantro.
[183:33.65]If my father's even in the same room as cilantro, he will throw up.
[183:41.41]Did I do them all?
[183:48.28]What's left?
[183:52.02]Holy shit, there's a whole page I didn't do.
[183:53.82]The cream puffs!
[183:54.36]What am I thinking?
[183:54.98]I didn't do the cream puffs.
[184:07.95]Cream puffs with ice cream are better than cream puffs with the cream.
[184:12.49]Is that accurate for a lot of you guys?
[184:22.04]That's wrong?
[184:24.28]Well, if you eat it right away.
[184:31.69]You gotta eat it right away.
[184:40.88]stew.
[184:41.34]Are we making sugar?
[184:44.10]We'll make a little vomit father.
[184:48.12]I thought we were over that.
[184:51.21]Vomit father.
[184:52.65]That's a lot of butter.
[184:55.53]I don't even know what to say.
[185:12.47]They make me cry!
[185:17.10]Just eat butter.
[185:18.42]Vomit father.
[185:20.62]Why is there an egg going in here?
[185:25.88]What is this?
[185:33.11]Local sperm is afraid of butter?
[185:38.27]It's custard, dummy!
[185:40.83]Well, get away from me, because I go violent!
[185:46.59]Oh, I can't.
[185:47.76]Okay, I finished that fucking thing.
[185:49.50]I can't.
[185:49.72]I have ADHD.
[185:50.42]I can't help it.
[185:51.26]Let's use that as an excuse for literally everything I've ever done in my whole life.
[185:55.72]In my entire life.
[185:57.06]I'll do it like this.
[186:15.95]Jeremy!
[186:19.77]He's snapping all the time.
[186:23.12]I don't give a shit, alright?
[186:48.24]Turn it off!
[186:49.02]What the fuck?
[186:50.08]It doesn't do it that quick.
[186:52.30]Oh, he will.
[186:52.92]He will.
[186:58.41]Anything can be... We've seen, like, five to ten different deepfakes at this point.
[187:02.65]Do you think I really care?
[187:03.59]Do you think I'm at the point right now where I'm like, man, I really hope they don't, like, put me in, like, something that I'm not supposed to be in?
[187:11.68]Not right now!
[187:19.55]What's jello made of?
[187:20.44]I don't know.
[187:21.88]Bones.
[187:23.34]Jelly, on the other hand.
[187:24.28]Do not mine.
[187:47.94]Why would you do it like this?
[187:51.40]What the fuck?
[187:56.41]I only have one egg?
[187:57.53]I can't try again?
[187:58.43]That's wasting.
[188:12.31]Wait, does it imply that she's just doing it for me?
[188:17.63]What's the difference between jam and jelly?
[188:19.23]Tons of differences.
[188:20.75]A fucking huge amount of differences, but we're not going to get into them today. ...
[188:50.07]Jelly is base- it's just BASED jello.
[189:01.32]That's fucking ridiculous.
[189:04.66]What the fuck are you even talking about?
[189:08.94]Vanilla extract.
[189:15.27]Can't that stuff kill you?
[189:18.11]If you have too much vanilla extract, can it, like, kill you?
[189:28.04]Anything can kill you.
[189:29.18]Yeah.
[189:32.06]Probably.
[189:32.44]Yeah, if you chug it.
[189:33.60]No, it's like straight alcohol, right?
[189:35.04]Yeah.
[189:35.54]It's bad.
[189:35.98]It's, like, very bad.
[189:37.88]Okay.
[189:38.40]Hold the B button to squeeze the cream onto the pastry.
[189:40.78]Be careful!
[189:41.40]Alright, let's do it.
[189:48.73]I don't know what you're talking about, Mama.
[189:57.01]This is how me and my family like it.
[190:01.39]That one in the top row, I would grab it immediately.
[190:20.02]Too much cream?
[190:22.70]I don't think there's actually a sentence that makes sense where you say that.
[190:25.35]Too much cream in your cream-filled pastry.
[190:32.03]I don't know about that.
[190:33.01]Ooh!
[190:33.25]What's that one?
[190:44.29]Ooh, lasagna.
[190:45.27]My least favorite Italian delight.
[190:48.51]Dessert.
[190:49.07]Whatever.
[190:49.41]My least favorite Italian fantastic food.
[190:57.94]Lasagna.
[191:05.07]Actually, I don't... I don't like it.
[191:06.77]Those of you that might be new viewers... I'll eat lasagna, but I don't really... I would choose not to eat lasagna.
[191:22.92]To me, it's kind of... I don't know, it's kind of boring.
[191:26.34]It kind of bores me.
[191:29.48]Do you like spaghetti and meatballs?
[191:34.44]yeah I do but like lasagna is it's like just it it's always like mushes together it's like usually like a meat sauce and like just layers of this pasta sheets and you like take your fork and like mush through it and I don't know I don't I'm not I'll eat it I don't hate it but I don't I wouldn't order it there's not it's like this doesn't do it for me
[192:00.22]It's like a spaghetti cake.
[192:01.26]That's a good way to put it.
[192:03.62]Do you like balsamic vinegar?
[192:09.80]No.
[192:10.88]I don't.
[192:12.00]I actually don't.
[192:18.17]I love olive oil, though.
[192:20.05]Like, one of my favorite things on Earth.
[192:25.27]I don't...
[192:29.89]That I can't stand by.
[192:31.21]Why not?
[192:40.94]A really good EVOO just dumped on top of Hummus.
[192:45.37]I could eat that every day and be happy.
[192:48.15]You could just put me into a room and have a fridge in there, and in that fridge was just a ton of just garlic hummuses, some pita bread to the right, just like hundreds of bags of it, and then like 30 bottles of EVOO, and you'd think like you were torturing me, and I would be like, no, this is perfect.
[193:06.44]Thanks.
[193:07.65]See you in a fucking couple months when I want more of this.
[193:23.42]Extra virgin olive oil.
[193:29.04]Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[193:31.20]Do I have irritation under here or something?
[193:33.91]What's going on?
[193:34.39]I'm a little irritated under here.
[193:37.19]Why?
[193:37.73]A mauled rash.
[194:02.19]EVOO.
[194:03.71]Extra virgin olive oil.

[194:15.48]I'm a really food motivated person.
[194:28.26]You're a dog.
[194:38.22]Says the man that doesn't eat lasagna.
[194:39.50]Yeah, I have my different preferences, but I love food.
[194:47.29]You don't look like it.
[194:48.21]I really love food.

[195:23.39]Not ideal.

[195:27.59]Struck a nerve there.
[195:28.63]McDonald's?
[195:29.79]I like McDonald's.
[195:31.47]Onions.
[195:57.34]Alright.
[195:58.14]Perfect timing.
[196:00.44]Come on, Onion.
[196:03.96]Excellent.
[196:09.41]McDonald's is good.
[196:11.87]If you say that McDonald's sucks, you're probably smart.
[196:14.43]You probably have a lot of intelligence in you.
[196:16.45]Your brain is huge.
[196:17.29]But...
[196:22.33]I mean, come on, like, for the rest of us, like, dumb fucking idiots, you only eat McDonald's if you're a fucking moron, you know, for all of us other idiots.
[196:30.22]Um, I think it's, I think it's good.
[196:32.58]I like it.
[196:32.90]I don't eat it all the time.
[196:38.19]Alright, let's make the, here we go.
[196:45.25]Idiot crew.
[196:53.68]The idiot move is not going to Wendy's.
[196:55.54]They're all good.
[196:57.53]You just feel like them sometimes.
[196:58.99]You go on like a stint when you want one.
[197:01.59]Like a month straight.
[197:03.61]And you don't want the other one.
[197:05.27]Ster it!
[197:11.15]Tomato sauce.
[197:15.61]One of these is dog shit.
[197:17.51]No, I- I just ate- I ate it too much, so I'm just sick of eating it.
[197:22.17]Alright, time to make some lasagna.
[197:24.05]Memorize the example!
[197:27.23]But first the- point it in green, then press A button to add the ingredients in the same order.
[197:34.56]They get in the same order.
[197:36.34]Alright, mushrooms, meat, sheet.
[197:48.19]Okay, meat, sheet, mushrooms.
[197:56.49]What is all that on top?
[197:57.45]Alright.

[198:32.10]Alright put it in the oven.
[198:35.14]Alright we're gonna cook this slow.
[198:38.12]Slow. 5 degrees.
[198:46.84]Looks like banana bread.
[198:48.06]A lot of very goods.
[198:50.44]I got something new.
[198:53.18]It's a new dish.
[198:55.19]Ooh!
[198:56.03]Pumpkin!
[198:56.43]Grilled bonito.
[199:17.78]Hand-fried lobster.
[199:18.90]Let's do the bonito.
[199:26.01]Gotta dice up the fish.
[199:27.09]What kind of fish is it?
[199:28.59]It's a bonito.
[199:31.33]Take that filet out.
[199:50.27]Head.
[199:53.06]Oh, sad faces.
[199:54.14]Head.
[199:58.16]Slaughtering a fish.
[200:13.88]Why are there four different salts?
[200:16.16]I don't know, because, like, I don't know, there's, like, sea salt, the Himalayan pink salt, deep salt, I don't know.
[200:25.42]There's a lot of different salts.
[200:27.96]Alright, grill.
[200:31.94]We didn't have the grill yet.
[200:33.93]Hold the fan with the V button and wave it to increase the heat.
[200:58.37]How do I, do I flip it?
[201:00.07]How do I flip it?
[201:00.73]Turn it over.
[201:01.19]Ooh, that looks pretty good.
[201:15.36]This looks like a pretty, like, fish to me.
[201:17.66]I love video game fish.
[201:21.85]Hey!
[201:22.11]It didn't tell me to take it off!
[201:31.00]Video game fish looks so appetizing.
[201:33.68]I like fish, too, in real life.
[201:35.18]There's something about in a video game.
[201:38.22]Just a fish on, like, a stick.
[201:40.52]You know what I'm saying?
[201:49.90]SpongeBob?
[201:54.02]How many of these do I have?
[201:57.22]Ah, that was raw.
[202:27.39]It's the news fish from Spongebob.
[202:29.63]Alright, move the Wiimote for us so we're gonna cut it up.
[202:38.36]It's cooked, right?
[202:46.46]This is wood.
[202:51.62]I feel like it was tough to cut through that.
[202:54.07]Shouldn't it have been moist and tender?
[203:00.88]Isn't grating?
[203:03.64]Burrito is the hardest food in the world.
[203:09.63]The hardest to make or it's physically hard to chew through because it's hard.
[203:14.81]Physically hard.
[203:34.67]You could kill someone with it.
[203:36.19]Really?
[203:36.55]So that's accurate.
[203:37.35]So it's like a big block?
[203:38.95]How are you supposed to eat it?
[203:41.41]How do you eat this?
[203:46.99]Fine dining.
[204:03.26]That plate was 180 bucks.
[204:09.08]You shave it into strips, you idiot.
[204:12.14]Why did Mama not do that?
[204:13.21]That was an inch and a half thick cut.
[204:19.75]Who's the- I'm the idiot.
[204:20.75]Are you sure it's not Mama's instructions and Mama's bad recipe?
[204:34.53]You consume it as an enema.
[204:38.77]Did you go to a restaurant?
[204:47.94]Oh, yeah, I'll take the bonito.
[204:49.78]How's your bonito?
[204:50.62]Is it any good?
[204:52.44]Well, it's one of our more famous dishes.
[204:55.24]You're like, I'm not sure.
[204:56.84]Let me just get an opinion here.
[204:59.46]You look over and there's a guy like two tables over who's like, gotta go.
[205:04.90]Hey, how's the bonito?
[205:08.32]Fantastic!
[205:10.36]Okay, too salty?
[205:12.71]Ah, it's just perfectly, perfectly seasoned I'll try the bonito Oh, brochette What is brochette?
[205:34.24]Oh, dude, bruschetta's the hottest fucking food in the world.
[205:36.38]You could kill somebody with this loaf of red meat.
[205:43.77]Thinly sliced.
[206:00.71]This conversation wouldn't have happened in Chibi-Robo.
[206:04.36]Yes, it would have.
[206:08.14]Why are you giving... You're giving a lot of credit to the fact that we would have this same conversation in Chibi... There's a cooking mission in Chibi-Robo.
[206:16.33]Isn't there?
[206:16.69]Don't you cook in Chibi-Robo?
[206:24.43]Don't you make food for the family and stuff?
[206:26.28]I can't wait to play it.
[206:38.69]God damn it, Jeremy.
[206:39.85]Get it right.
[206:44.77]It's I hope we never part.
[206:46.16]Get it right or pay the price.
[206:50.52]Up into pieces.
[206:53.14]Okay.
[207:03.09]Ooh, I love asparagus.
[207:05.66]This is... That's a huge asparagus.
[207:07.48]Shiitake.
[207:12.28]Onions.
[207:33.65]Worst joke of the night.
[207:35.35]By far.
[207:36.87]Like, by far.
[207:37.81]That was so bad.
[207:39.71]I'll take that one.
[207:40.47]That was really bad.
[207:47.21]Wait, you roll the onion into the meat?
[207:49.94]You roll the mushrooms into the meat?
[207:53.02]Hold on a second.
[207:54.14]It's a thinly sliced piece of meat, like beef or steak, and you put a big chunk of onion in and you roll it up.
[208:01.96]Why have I not eaten this yet?
[208:07.69]I think I would really like this.
[208:12.65]And you place it on a stick.
[208:16.43]In the same order, so it's almost like a kebab?
[208:18.91]Okay, so... What the hell are you talking about?
[208:27.48]Wait, I'm supposed to guess?
[208:32.76]No, take that off.
[208:36.98]Why are you making me guess, Mom?
[208:47.13]I really thought I was going to get a first try here.
[208:55.75]Wait, it's the same every time, isn't it?
[209:01.20]Oh, okay, right.
[209:01.92]I thought they switched it up on you.
[209:18.72]Thoughts on the democratic debate?
[209:20.81]That doesn't matter
[209:47.11]Turn it!
[209:51.77]God, it's like sucks being the grill guy, you know what I mean?
[209:54.69]Like, I don't want to fuck up everybody's food at the party, but I'm not qualified to be over here.
[209:58.74]I'm the only one that said I just raised my hand when somebody said, hey, who can get on the fucking grill?
[210:04.92]Oh, there's like a hundred people here that I could fucking poison.
[210:09.56]Great, put me on.
[210:21.77]Don't eat that one!
[210:22.39]No, no, no, no!
[210:23.03]Don't eat that one!
[210:23.59]Throw it in the trash!
[210:24.85]Throw that one in the trash!
[210:26.37]This hurts the ol' arm here.
[210:39.45]And by the way, why are we in, like, 14th century England?
[210:43.63]I gotta... Where's, like, the propane?
[210:45.89]Or the fuckin' charcoal?
[210:47.13]Or...
[210:50.14]I didn't even cook this one.
[210:51.82]It just started rotting.
[211:29.14]Use your other hand?
[211:30.10]No, I'm a Britey.
[211:36.37]Propane and propane accessories.
[211:39.75]Actually, I wonder how dividing this will be.
[211:45.35]I like grilled food, right?
[211:48.94]I'm a big fan.
[211:50.20]More than propane, I like charcoal more than propane.
[211:55.65]I think charcoal tastes better.
[211:56.73]Alright, is that... Is that weird?
[211:59.91]Is that not... Alright, let's do pan-fried lobster.
[212:07.22]Everybody agrees with that.
[212:08.16]Alright, I didn't know.
[212:08.88]Some people are like, no, man.
[212:14.17]Whoa.
[212:20.73]Jesus.
[212:25.21]Why did I cut his arms off first?
[212:29.85]There's a lot of things here.
[212:40.41]White powder, white powder.
[212:54.49]uh Pokémon one Pokémon two and then Pokémon three
[213:20.48]Now that's the worst joke, you're getting it, you understand.
[213:23.16]That's to cover up the last one.
[213:25.10]So you'll remember that one, you won't remember the other one.
[213:28.50]Just fucking complete and total, just, like, just tactics.
[213:37.57]Everyone's gonna be like, dude, that fucking, remember the Pokémon, like, green joke thing?
[213:42.19]Like, it was so bad, it was bleaching so hard.
[213:44.43]Like, alright, dude, that was not funny.
[213:46.41]Yeah, and then you're not gonna talk about the other one.
[213:53.69]Oh, I win.
[213:56.81]I win.
[214:10.02]The house always wins.
[214:11.16]I don't really eat grilled lobster or like pan-fried lobster.
[214:22.40]I'm actually not a huge fan of lobster, but... Usually it's... I don't eat it like that.
[214:27.16]I've had grilled... I really don't... I know it's a really popular way to eat it, but I don't eat, like, grilled and fried lobster.
[214:37.68]Alright, let's serve it.
[215:23.46]Why is dessert on the same plate?
[215:25.25]I don't get it.
[215:39.65]He doesn't know?
[215:42.91]I mean, why would you- Dessert on the same plate just seems- You get like lobster juice in your foie, aren't you gonna be a little upset?
[215:57.02]If you don't like lobster, where are you actually from?
[216:00.20]I don't hate it.
[216:02.75]I would prefer crab.
[216:03.91]I like crab more than lobster.
[216:05.27]Alright, well, we're moving on.
[216:07.37]How much do we have left?
[216:08.99]Fettuccine.
[216:09.49]Tortilla.
[216:10.13]We've done a shitload of these.
[216:25.82]White fish manure.
[216:29.50]Meatloaf with sausage?
[216:30.86]I thought this was, like, a raspberry pound cake.
[216:35.02]Let's do the white fish manure.
[216:35.82]Manure.
[216:35.96]M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M
[216:54.77]Mounier?
[216:56.31]Mounier?
[216:59.92]Mounier.
[217:01.54]Mounier.
[217:04.94]Whitefish Mounier.
[217:09.78]It's garlic in everything.
[217:10.76]Imagine if you were allergic to fucking garlic.
[217:12.61]You would never be able to eat food.
[217:15.79]It's put in everything.
[217:24.58]Ooh, soul.
[217:25.32]Flatfish!
[217:26.96]Ooh.
[217:27.20]Killing off the skin.
[217:28.60]That easy, apparently.
[217:31.36]Whitefish manure.
[217:32.26]Add to the milk?
[217:58.75]Soak fish in milk.
[218:15.76]I won't be eating this anytime soon.
[218:17.92]I will not be ordering white fish manure.
[218:20.24]I don't think I will.
[218:30.78]What does this taste like?
[218:38.27]Shake the milk and then flower a flower.
[218:40.63]Is it fried?
[218:54.37]Somebody just fucked with me.
[218:57.77]Somebody fucked with me.
[218:59.91]That's like I took the salt shaker, I'm gonna put some salt on, and the whole thing comes out.
[219:04.85]Like this shitty prank.
[219:06.87]Somebody pranked me.
[219:07.71]That's so bad.
[219:18.11]alright now we pan fry our milk fish milk and flour
[219:44.49]I mean, I guess that's not super... I guess that's not weird or anything.
[219:47.71]It's just kind of different.
[219:51.23]Although, you soak it in the milk.
[219:53.17]You don't just, like, lay it in there for a second.
[219:54.77]You soak it.
[219:57.99]It's two different fishes.
[219:59.11]What about the bones?
[220:09.79]There it is.
[220:16.79]That's how you make fried chicken?
[220:21.18]I think chicken's a little different than fish.
[220:23.36]I don't know if I'd want milk on fish.
[220:25.40]Something about this... I don't know.
[220:30.52]Something about this is weird.
[220:34.45]No new American dishes, by the way.
[220:39.76]Oh!
[220:40.95]Boulab... Boulabassé!
[220:43.67]Boulabassé!
[220:47.07]French?
[220:47.46]Boulabassé.
[220:48.02]Let's prepare the boulabassé.
[220:53.26]Boulabase.
[220:54.01]Boulabassé.
[221:12.68]It's a scallop, huh?
[221:16.80]It's the only little thing you know.
[221:20.32]I'm using a chisel to get a scallop.
[221:31.85]What fish is that?
[221:35.21]That's a Stardew Valley fish.
[221:36.73]What was that?
[221:37.27]What animal is this?
[221:42.51]It's weird meat.
[221:45.08]Round like a red animal.
[222:15.03]Why are you farming?
[222:16.01]I don't know, cause it's fun.
[222:18.32]Why am I cooking the tail?
[222:23.08]Do you really want to eat the tail?
[222:24.66]Why do you need three salt shakers?
[222:30.42]I don't know.
[222:32.06]Ask Mama, it's her house.
[222:45.90]I use the spices to flavor the spices.
[222:47.94]Alright.
[222:49.06]How do I pronounce this?
[222:50.16]How do you actually pronounce it?
[223:04.01]Booyah.
[223:05.21]Booyah bass?
[223:07.67]Booyah bass.
[223:08.99]Come on!
[223:15.25]Booyah bass.
[223:15.83]Booyah bass.
[223:16.29]Booyah bass.
[223:17.56]Booyah bass.
[223:18.56]Booyah bass.
[223:20.80]Okay.
[223:22.50]Booyah bass.
[223:44.32]The bouillabaisse is silent.
[223:49.08]This is actually... I think I've had this before.
[223:51.36]I feel like I've had... Yeah, I've eaten this before.
[223:55.42]This is delicious.
[223:57.06]It's got a bunch of seafood, like that tomato base.
[223:59.59]It's fantastic.
[224:00.69]Have you had this before?
[224:05.61]It's a lie?
[224:06.15]No, it's not.
[224:08.23]Kim ordered it, and I tried it.
[224:09.59]And I had like three or four sips of the broth, and then I tried like one of those scallops and shit.
[224:18.68]I thought that was American.
[224:20.38]I thought it was gonna be like a Cobb salad.
[224:50.42]It is a Cobb salad.
[224:53.70]What is this?
[224:56.44]Remove the yolk.
[224:57.36]Alright.
[225:16.71]I caught it!
[225:18.41]Alright, you're kind of losing me here.
[225:27.67]Eggs and vinegar?
[225:29.59]That's a lot of vinegar.
[225:49.24]You know like the way that raw eggs smell?
[225:52.32]Now imagine raw eggs and vinegar in the same... Yeah.
[226:01.73]That's mayo?
[226:02.35]That's not mayo.
[226:03.13]Mayo's oil.
[226:03.63]I mean, no.
[226:24.59]Old men like peppers
[226:43.52]It's a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice.
[226:47.54]Give it, like, a tiny bit.
[226:49.93]Like, only a little bit of lemon juice.
[226:51.57]Only a little bit of it.
[226:52.15]You don't, like, dump half the bottle in like she was.
[226:58.01]Cutting is satisfying.
[226:58.79]It really is.
[227:02.01]Red pepper, yellow pepper, and onion.
[227:08.45]Maybe it's a lot of mayo.
[227:10.63]Wonderful.
[227:12.15]Better than Mama.
[227:13.79]Making an egg salad.
[227:16.21]I love egg salad.
[227:20.80]That's good.
[227:22.26]Good job.
[227:23.68]Excellent.
[227:25.12]Do not mind.
[227:26.12]Oh, this is the last pieces for some reason.
[227:28.46]Do not mind.
[227:28.96]Good job.
[227:42.21]I do acknowledge it looks gross.
[227:45.36]If you make egg salad chunky enough, it looks a lot more appetizing than if you make it paste.
[227:50.78]Put a little bit of dill in there too, you make it look not just like a paste.
[228:07.01]Wonderful!
[228:08.53]Better than Mama!
[228:10.03]You can go south real easily.
[228:11.25]Well, you gotta eat it within a couple of days.
[228:14.95]You can really get into trouble with egg salad if you make it, and you make a bunch of it, and then a week and a half goes by.
[228:20.78]And you go, oh man, I really want some of that egg salad!
[228:24.04]And you open the fridge.
[228:26.40]And now your whole house smells like rotten egg.
[228:29.84]Okay, here we go.
[228:44.19]I don't know what this is.
[228:47.66]It's like a salad of some sort.
[229:09.40]I really... I've never had this.
[229:10.44]Like... I wanna...
[229:55.85]You're really gonna have to fucking find it, you know what I mean?
[230:04.00]You really gotta search for it in there.
[230:10.98]It's a nest for an egg.
[230:15.98]It's an egg nest.
[230:24.80]That's a stand-up-and-leave-the-restaurant kind of presentation.
[230:29.72]That's a, like, excuse me... What is this?
[230:34.36]Is this going to get fixed, or... I don't want the check or anything after this.
[230:44.75]Alright, let's pick the raspberry pound cake.
[230:52.64]Crack the egg.
[230:57.11]Where's the American food?
[231:00.19]I know, I'm with you.
[231:01.19]I really am.
[231:02.15]I've been playing it for this long and I want to see what the American food is.
[231:06.92]Excellent!
[231:09.06]Great!
[231:13.96]Good job!
[231:17.38]Awesome!
[231:19.02]Bonus!
[231:21.56]Wonderful!
[231:24.88]Better than Mama!
[231:28.03]fried butter meatloaf with sausage alright let's go onion pop it up what are we gonna make burgers we made burger before but a long time ago don't they know that American cuisine is not just hamburgers
[231:52.36]It's the rest of the menu at that restaurant, which is 12 different burgers.
[231:56.02]We've got a cheeseburger.
[231:58.48]A, uh, barbecue sauce and onion rings burger.
[232:02.72]A, uh, macaroni and cheeseburger.
[232:04.88]It's not just hamburger.
[232:10.65]And they all have really cool names.
[232:12.93]Like, we have, we name, like, you know, like the... The Super Juicer!
[232:16.45]And it's like a fucking lettuce with, like, two eggs on it.
[232:20.79]Oh, the lazy sundae!
[232:22.94]It's like two patties with two pieces of bacon and a couple of hash browns on it.
[232:27.82]Come on, wait, wait!
[232:28.92]That's American!
[232:30.70]Where are all those?
[232:31.62]I want that garlic in here!
[232:48.19]Come on, onions!
[232:49.47]Come on, onions!

[233:00.84]How's that?
[233:01.90]Alright.
[233:02.50]Meatball with sausage.
[233:20.16]There's a whole wall of streaming trophies?
[233:29.34]I would kill to smell some onions in a pan right now.
[233:42.34]I mean, you probably have onions in your house.
[233:46.63]You could make that happen right now if you really wanted to.
[233:50.21]Onions are in every house.
[233:51.21]You could just go do that.
[233:55.37]Just go... go do it!
[233:58.46]Chop up some onions, sizzle them up in a pan with a little oil and... I don't know... Put it on like a bologna and cheese sandwich.
[234:07.74]Who cares?
[234:08.28]Just eat it.
[234:13.69]Alright, where's the American food?
[234:15.25]How would you ruin a perfectly good sandwich like that?
[234:19.83]What's wrong with that?
[234:20.61]Onions on... Onions are good.
[234:45.30]What the hell was that?
[234:46.66]What am I doing?
[234:47.72]Is this hot dogs?
[234:49.56]What are those?

[235:13.63]This is weird.
[235:15.47]Cinnamon hiding turds.

[235:51.10]Cut it?
[235:55.68]This is- I don't know if I like this.
[235:59.54]This is weird, like, cartoon food.
[236:06.73]Serve as much as you like.
[236:07.71]Isn't it just the brick?
[236:24.00]Okay, I would eat two of these.
[236:25.45]Two would make sense.
[236:28.83]Take that.
[236:32.65]Right there.
[236:58.89]I'm trying to make it actually presenting.
[237:00.65]Yeah, it does look like Fancy Feast.
[237:28.05]Somebody said cat food.
[237:29.63]It looks like when you turn the can it just... Fancy face.
[237:35.97]And they have that big, huge, like white, fuzzy ass cat.

[238:46.75]It's just in the air.
[238:58.66]Just because an animal licks you doesn't mean you should lick it back.
[239:22.83]No, that's not a joke.
[239:23.88]He's correct.
[239:24.80]I know.
[239:25.30]But people are saying that I'm licking a cat.

[239:46.03]I'm saying that there's hair everywhere.
[239:48.51]Getting better.

[242:38.30]It's the same thing, except you dip bread in it.
[242:41.36]It's like the milk after you eat the cereal.

[248:04.15]There's no other pizzas, I'm sorry.
[248:05.59]They don't exist.
[248:07.33]Get that heat up.
[248:28.55]I would send you a can of surstromming, but it might be, uh... Uh, I wouldn't eat surstromming.

[249:47.79]Why are there scallops in my sushi?
[249:53.67]I don't want this.
[250:01.54]I wanted a tuna roll.
[250:02.48]I wanted a spicy tuna roll.
[250:03.38]I don't want scallops.
[250:10.16]Is this a durian?
[250:12.59]That is a durian.
[250:16.45]Alright, let's keep going.

[250:36.45]I like salmon sashimi.
[250:39.66]Maki rolls.
[250:40.20]I don't really like... I like maki rolls.
[250:43.64]I'm not a big fan of... Tuna, sashimi, salmon, sashimi, just over the rice.
[250:49.54]I'm okay with that.
[250:51.80]But I like rolls.
[250:53.31]I like maki rolls.
[250:55.15]You're a normie.
[250:55.77]You're a normie.
[251:12.67]Um, am I?
[251:13.87]Because I know a lot of people that don't eat sushi.
[251:18.93]They just physically refuse to eat it.
[251:27.16]That's a lot of wasabi.
[251:30.28]It is.
[251:30.54]Alright, add water.
[251:39.72]Sorry, I had to, like, hard blink.
[251:41.16]I haven't blinked, like, hard in probably, like, two hours.
[251:46.18]I love sushi.
[251:46.86]You eat exclusively California rolls.
[251:49.10]I just told you I eat fucking salmon!
[251:51.56]Raw salmon!
[251:54.10]That's not a California roll!
[251:55.62]That's not special.
[252:03.53]I don't... Why do I have to be special?
[252:05.91]I like what I like!

[252:32.91]I like snapper.
[252:35.53]On occasion.
[252:36.09]Not all the time.
[252:37.75]Very good.

[254:14.64]Let me put it on!
[254:17.84]Make scallop sushi with- what?
[254:21.19]Wait, once I pick the fish, I can't put the wasabi on?
[254:23.57]What does it say?
[254:24.93]What does it say?
[254:25.45]What was it?
[254:28.62]What does it say?
[254:29.30]What does it say?

[256:16.31]Nice plating.
[256:19.23]It's a Wii game, dude.
[256:20.91]I'm not serving this to a fucking guy that paid me a shitload of money to make it.
[256:26.50]I'm not serving this at a restaurant.
[256:29.72]Where's the ketchup?
[256:33.80]I don't know.
[256:37.89]Where is the ketchup?
[256:42.11]Come on, dude.
[256:43.67]Baked beans?
[256:44.39]Ooh, it's Japanese!
[256:47.45]You know what I think that we could get for an American cuisine is New England clam chowder.
[256:52.23]Let's make truffles.
[256:56.61]I'm just a home chef.
[256:59.61]That would make sense.
[257:08.62]Oh.

[257:11.98]Listen to me.
[257:12.72]Gonna be out on this.

[257:39.76]Now throw that pie in your face.
[257:41.32]Too much sugar?
[257:42.08]That's so good.
[257:44.26]Banana cream pie is fucking un- It's legendary.
[257:46.72]It's the only dessert worth eating.
[257:49.08]It's- Somebody just said, worse pie.
[257:50.46]You're just doing that to make me angry.
[257:51.78]It's so- Play Cooking Mama.
[257:55.52]Oh.

[258:02.08]Okay.
[258:05.96]It is the best pie.
[258:06.70]I know it is.

[258:08.63]What?
[258:09.47]What's wrong with these They need to be bigger
[258:37.85]Shape the truffles.
[258:38.75]Ooh, this is going to be fun.
[258:48.63]Are these creamy?
[258:49.67]Are these chewy?
[258:50.94]Okay, are these creamy and chewy?
[258:53.44]That's what I look for in a dessert sometimes.
[258:55.30]Getting better.
[259:04.57]I can't even respond because then I'm part of it.
[259:36.99]You look over it?
[259:39.70]Well, I mean, one could argue that I would be considering... All chat was saying right there was that I was molding shit all over my hands.
[259:50.40]Pooh hands.
[259:51.62]Shit in your hands.
[259:55.50]What's the proper reaction?

[260:20.96]That's like cookies and cream.
[260:22.28]What's this one?
[260:23.10]It's like sand.
[260:25.02]I don't want that one.
[260:25.92]Chocolate and cookies and cream.
[260:32.25]Spider eggs.
[260:39.22]Spider eggs?

[261:46.76]Gnocchi.
[261:49.10]Now we chop up the tomatoes?
[261:57.23]You're a fake Italian.
[262:00.95]That's interesting because I'm not Italian.
[262:03.77]Why would I...
[262:08.20]I have to go off-cam
[262:36.02]People write this stuff, this is making no sense.
[262:41.00]Why am I hiding?
[262:41.82]Because sometimes I have to hide.
[262:45.28]Time to stop watching the stream then.
[262:49.25]What?
[262:50.83]Ooh, mash the potatoes.
[262:52.13]Aren't there better ways to do this?
[263:10.79]Don't they make a machine?
[263:16.85]Don't you put it in the machine to lick your feet.
[263:20.90]It's not grapes.
[263:25.54]Grape stopping.
[263:29.16]Just chew them.
[263:31.22]Chew them and spit them out.
[263:32.82]I gotta go off-cam.
[263:47.84]Yes, I can hide.
[263:49.12]Yes, I can.
[263:53.99]Chewing up potatoes and spinning them into a ball.
[264:02.03]And you do that for like eight different potatoes?

[264:45.70]I just opened up the bag from the grocery store and put it into the boiling water.
[264:49.73]This is a lot of work.
[264:52.03]Whoa.
[265:15.04]The world is literally huge.
[265:16.94]The world is actually very small on a geometric galactic space.
[265:22.13]Based on the fact that we are one of six to seven trillion different galaxies within one or two star fleets of us.
[265:28.81]So... Sorry, sir.

[281:34.18]With ice cream.
[281:35.38]In fact, I'm going to turn this in.
[281:40.84]I just want to eat the ice cream version of whatever this is.

[282:18.86]Oh, they'll do a dessert bowl.
[282:24.75]Alright, put it in the, uh, let's bake it.
[282:27.79]Let's see what it turns into.

[283:08.80]What time is it?
[283:12.48]Alright, I gotta go in like 30 minutes.
[283:15.41]Yeah, I gotta get out of here.
[283:18.41]I gotta go in like 30 minutes.
[283:19.71]I have to like... I need food.
[283:22.71]This is a food stream.
[283:23.89]I need to eat it.
[283:30.44]By the way, speaking of my favorite fruit, it's this one right here.
[283:35.90]Josh said that he respects you highly.
[283:40.95]Well, thank you, Josh.
[283:43.83]That means a lot.
[283:47.97]Thanks a lot.
[283:50.15]You're welcome.
[283:54.67]Is this how you do it?
[283:55.57]This is how you do it.
[283:57.61]You got it correct.
[284:00.20]What idiot likes kiwi?
[284:01.38]This idiot.
[284:04.77]It's delicious.
[284:08.53]Is that kiwi ice cream?
[284:17.89]There's an ice cream for every fruit, but I feel like there's not an ice cream for kiwi.
[284:24.60]Isn't that weird?
[284:27.92]Kiwi has a weird flavor.
[284:30.44]Hard to pinpoint.
[284:31.42]It's sort of just sweet and tart.
[284:42.76]You're allergic to kiwi?
[284:49.84]Josh viewers are doing exactly what Josh said not to do.
[284:53.00]The fuck are they doing?
[284:56.48]Oh, we bring the banhammer down hard here.
[284:58.96]What's going on here?
[285:00.49]What's going on?
[285:03.51]They said, don't embarrass him.
[285:14.42]Oh, I really blew off the handle on that one.
[285:16.92]We're a community.
[285:18.72]We're very welcoming to everybody here.
[285:20.32]Come on in.
[285:22.42]What's up?
[285:23.11]Have fun here as we do.
[285:36.38]No, not embarrassing the streamer.
[285:39.30]I embarrass myself every time the broadcast turns on at least once.
[285:44.26]The first hour of this stream, guys, was me fighting with the fact that I had a broken, corrupted fucking GameCube memory card.
[285:53.02]I'm gonna sit in the bath tonight and just be going like this.
[286:00.02]I did- I did my research.
[286:05.94]How is it even- How is it even- He's getting upset already.
[286:13.89]Whoa!
[286:20.51]I'm just gonna set myself in the face.

[289:07.62]asymmetric yeah I'm not a machine okay I'm a person I'm a human and I I have human eyes
[289:36.14]What is that?
[289:36.78]It's a random fruit pie thing.
[289:40.34]Mixed fruit, and that's a UK thing, apparently.
[289:43.40]The English decided to eat fruits.
[289:45.10]Ever.
[289:46.70]It's just fruits.
[289:54.35]Pretty good start, though, with pineapple.
[289:56.87]Should I get pineapple, too?
[290:05.66]I don't eat the skin, dude.
[290:06.90]Cut the skin off.
[290:10.18]You did this so badly.
[290:11.82]What the fuck are you doing?
[290:14.29]What the hell?
[290:15.21]No one's gonna eat that.
[290:19.33]That was lazy.
[290:28.03]It's UK style
[290:57.39]The sticker is still on.
[291:01.33]Don't eat the sticker.
[291:07.24]Orange.
[291:13.52]Alright.
[291:15.84]Kiwi.
[291:18.42]Gotta go cook in this.
[291:26.18]You're doing this wrong.
[291:27.10]Just do what I do.
[291:27.82]Put the ring in your mouth with the skin on.
[291:30.31]Mush it up and chew it up and separate it in your mouth like a hamster.
[291:33.61]You're doing this wrong.
[291:34.59]You're not doing it right.
[291:36.09]Alright, serve it.
[291:38.79]Serve it up.
[291:48.86]This is fruit.
[291:49.36]Fruit.
[292:08.85]Why would I put this on here?
[292:09.99]Oh, fucking who cares.
[292:15.77]Rabbit food?
[292:19.21]That's just the trash.
[292:29.92]That's all the stuff you're not supposed to eat.
[292:32.36]It's just the compost.
[292:40.63]Excellent!
[292:41.33]You're not mine!
[292:42.79]You're not mine!
[293:09.89]Two wings?
[293:12.67]Drop the Wiimote on the floor?
[293:17.97]Sure.
[293:41.45]You want me to drop the wave mode on the floor?
[293:43.53]Sure!
[293:43.91]Turn that frown upside down.
[293:49.51]He hates screaming.
[294:12.17]I mean, I heard, somebody told me that Wiimote's bounced.
[294:14.75]Is that, like, that's kind of... Well, that's... I didn't know that could... That's insane.
[294:20.59]Oh my god, that's... What the fuck?
[294:26.04]What?
[294:26.42]That's fucking crazy!
[294:27.46]I didn't know they made it out of rubber.
[294:33.18]That's fucked up.
[294:40.82]Awesome!
[294:47.77]That's a classic clown joke!
[294:50.13]Ah, what am I eating?
[295:04.85]Steamed egg custard.
[295:06.07]Oo, here's the stirring part.

[296:19.04]Guchou!
[296:20.20]Gray!
[296:21.62]Awesome!
[296:22.88]Do not mind!
[296:47.54]I was still waiting.
[296:49.94]Can I steam them?
[296:55.41]Here comes the scream.
[296:56.45]Ready?
[296:56.69]I didn't skip two wings.
[297:03.63]I did them.
[297:16.01]I did them in this proof on file.
[297:18.45]This proof on video that I did them.
[297:24.14]A new recipe.
[297:26.20]What is that one?
[297:29.44]What remains?
[297:33.64]I think we only have a couple left to do.
[297:40.58]Tomato sauce farfalla.
[297:43.50]Tomato sauce farfalla.
[297:46.75]Pizza?
[297:47.47]That's weird.
[297:47.97]I said it right!
[297:50.19]As far as I follow, right?
[297:53.64]Attack the pasta.
[297:56.08]Egg joke, again.
[298:16.54]My mother would love this game.
[298:42.49]Hey, mothers in chat!
[298:43.57]It's a baby game?
[298:52.42]But we get to see all kinds of foods!
[298:54.18]We get to see so many foods that we didn't know existed.
[298:57.58]Like barfala.
[298:59.68]Like mixed fruits.
[299:25.40]Baby drinks go-go squeezers and plays baby games.
[299:29.20]Do not mind.
[299:31.50]Good, good.
[299:31.84]Nearly finished.
[299:36.49]Not bad.
[299:37.93]Keep going.
[299:55.24]I fucked it up?
[299:55.94]Not really.
[300:00.29]Cooking Mama Recipe Tier List.
[300:04.03]I don't feel like that actually exists.
[300:12.75]It's gonna be every Cooking Mama, not just this one.
[300:15.62]So there'll be six or seven hundred recipes there.
[300:20.74]Mixed Fruit.
[300:21.40]S.
[300:26.66]Alright, here comes the tomato sauce.

[301:00.76]What the hell is this?
[301:01.84]A trumpet mushroom?
[301:05.10]I've never heard of that before.
[301:13.15]Japan loves mushrooms.
[301:17.43]Yeah, I love mushrooms.
[301:21.57]I like the one the grocery store in the package sealed up ones that are at the grocery store.
[301:32.39]I've never heard of it.
[301:34.29]You scare me when you do this.
[302:01.79]My eyes crossed for a second on that first one.
[302:04.59]I tried to hide it.
[302:05.13]Come on, mushrooms, hurry the fuck up.
[302:27.52]Hurry the fuck up.
[302:28.52]Whatever.
[302:35.91]extreme nerd neck I want this too I want every food oh oh I don't even need to do a poll no I don't guys
[303:02.49]Where can you get every food?
[303:17.30]Not the Cheesecake Factory.
[303:21.16]Where can you get as much of any food, of every food, in the world that you want?
[303:26.43]A buffet.
[303:36.30]I'm gonna need to have a bowl.
[303:42.47]I'm gonna go- I'm gonna go to a buffet.

[303:55.90]Pizza!
[304:03.12]Yep.
[304:10.74]Let's go.
[304:13.41]I'm fucking pumped.
[304:19.11]That's it.
[304:19.41]That's how you make a pizza.
[304:20.13]You just chop mushrooms and you're good.
[304:27.68]We saved the best for last.
[304:29.96]Bacon on a...
[304:33.35]Mushroom bacon pizza.
[304:35.49]This is gonna be a meat lover's pizza.
[304:45.47]Open a can... of tomatoes?
[304:55.64]Canned tomatoes.
[304:57.28]Corn?! !
[305:01.14]Why is it a can- why are we putting canned corn on our pizza?
[305:09.80]Mash the... tomatoes.
[305:12.04]That makes sense, obviously.
[305:22.20]Now add the ingredients.
[305:29.02]Why is there cake flour in here?
[305:30.46]Oh, EVOL?
[305:30.80]Sick.
[305:31.00]For the dough?
[305:32.34]Cake flour?
[305:33.64]Is Mama on drugs?
[306:07.33]This is a crack recipe.
[306:14.79]Well, hold on.
[306:15.49]Let's wait till- hold our reservations till we get to the end.
[306:18.07]Scratch the pizza dough.
[306:22.27]When do I stop?
[306:38.53]I mean, it's not a basketball.
[306:44.01]Thin crust.
[306:46.51]Now put it into the... here we go.
[306:51.32]Alright.
[307:08.43]No, I wanted to take it off!
[307:10.76]Wonderful!
[307:14.00]Better than Mama!
[307:21.02]They fixed it for me.
[307:22.47]That is not the fucking pizza I made.
[307:30.61]Wonderful!
[307:32.13]Better than Mama!
[307:36.07]It's not the pizza I put in the oven.
[307:38.17]You're microwaving the pizza.
[307:45.03]Okay, what would happen?
[307:47.29]What would actually happen?
[307:50.26]If you made pizza a pizza dough and you put it in the microwave for 10 minutes.
[307:55.42]What would it do?
[307:56.04]If you microwaved it for like 3-4 minutes, what would happen?
[308:06.21]Would it just be fucked up?
[308:09.85]Would it burn?
[308:10.63]I don't think it would burn.
[308:12.03]Alright, hold on.
[308:13.31]There's tofu here.
[308:15.97]It would be fucking horrible.
[308:28.94]It would be so rancid.
[308:30.02]Yeah, it would be so bad.
[308:31.28]Alright, let's dump it.
[308:35.19]It would melt and bubble?
[309:01.37]Are these soybeans?
[309:34.97]It's the fastest I can go!
[309:35.85]I can't go any faster than that!
[309:37.43]Stop looking down.
[310:10.20]When do you have to leave, King?
[310:11.50]Um, like right now.
[310:16.56]Yeah, right now.
[310:19.60]But I think this is the last one.
[310:23.58]What am I doing?
[310:31.56]Am I milking the tofu?
[310:33.16]Can you have tofu milk?
[310:58.85]Soy milk, right.
[310:59.75]Is that how you make soy milk?
[311:00.95]Is that how that makes milk?
[311:02.13]Soy milk?
[311:02.55]I don't know.
[311:03.11]Is that how they make it?
[311:04.67]Kind of.
[311:05.05]Hmm.
[311:05.25]Interesting.
[311:06.01]Alright, put it into the mold.
[311:07.51]How are you gonna get big and strong without milk?
[311:32.37]Just a couple more.
[311:34.95]And then I got it.
[311:37.03]Milk is just sugar.
[311:38.33]Milk is just sugar.
[311:40.35]It's not even actual milk.
[311:42.29]What are you talking about?
[312:01.93]That's good!
[312:02.43]Not bad!
[312:02.93]Keep going!
[312:03.26]Do not mind!
[312:04.28]Do not mind!
[312:24.80]I beat Cooking Mama Cookoff on stream.
[313:03.01]Assorted vegetables!
[313:04.49]Let's see, we did assorted fruit.
[313:07.77]So, vegetables were invented in Japan.
[313:17.94]What is the problem with eating the carrot?
[313:19.96]Like, what are you doing?
[313:26.05]Oh, we're making a design.
[313:28.41]We can get a flower?
[313:29.93]What else we got?
[313:31.87]A tarot.
[313:32.73]It's like a coconut?
[313:34.37]Bamboo shoot.
[314:03.24]Whoa, it's like a wing.
[314:04.54]That's cool.
[314:05.12]Akagi.
[314:05.62]Okay, now we stew them all.
[314:12.80]It's baby food.
[314:15.28]Close.
[314:36.58]Where are my shroomers?
[314:38.22]Shrooms.
[314:38.60]Jerm or what?
[314:39.12]A crack addict?
[315:06.91]Alright, let's put them out the way we want.
[315:13.29]All the vegetables on this list, I'll tell you, I probably really would only eat the carrot.
[315:16.67]And then the potato.
[315:18.21]I don't know.
[315:21.29]It doesn't matter.
[315:27.42]He's tired because he just started reading chat.
[315:33.29]Potato is not a vegetable.
[315:34.57]What is it, then?
[315:36.65]What's a potato?
[315:39.51]It's a root vegetable.
[315:40.63]How's another... You're a great chef.
[315:44.93]Oh, I got a... There's another pizza?
[315:46.76]Hand-fried batter cake.
[315:48.76]Alright, I'm out.
[316:04.20]I'm going to get food.
[316:05.86]It never ends.
[316:07.66]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[316:08.56]Go to bed, King.
[316:10.75]I'm hungry.
[316:11.25]This game just made me want to eat.
[316:21.82]Uh, so we're doing four days in a row this week.
[316:25.04]So we're doing today, tomorrow, and then Thursday, Friday.
[316:29.88]So.
[316:31.22]Didn't beat the final boss.
[316:32.29]We can come back and play this after.
[316:34.07]It's going to be plugged in, so if I want to make more recipes, I can.
[316:37.17]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[316:42.33]I nearly beat it.
[316:43.11]No.
[316:43.31]I'm hungry.
[316:44.22]Wait!
[316:44.68]We have to do a poll.
[316:47.20]No we don't.
[316:47.58]I'm going to a buffet.
[316:49.10]Yeah.
[316:49.30]Sick.
[316:50.99]Is this the guy that ate dinner on stream?
[316:53.11]One of them.
[316:56.94]That off.
[316:57.34]Alright, I will see you guys tomorrow for what should absolutely be Chibi-Robo.
[317:03.90]I'm going to do everything necessary to make it so the game is savable.
[317:07.76]I'm so annoyed by that.
[317:09.00]You have no idea.
[317:09.62]It's like the one fucking thing.
[317:14.53]But, I'll see you tomorrow.
[317:18.57]Let's put on some music.
[317:26.12]Let's do the bits.
[317:28.13]Go back to six and a half hours ago.
[317:32.41]We had 500 bits from Clink.
[317:35.53]Thank you, Clink.
[317:36.09]Chibi-Robo is legitimately my all-time favorite game.
[317:38.27]Makes me so happy to see my favorite streamer play my favorite game.
[317:41.82]I'm excited to see you experience this little bumper boop boop of a game.
[317:45.54]I can't wait.
[317:46.66]I'll be playing it tomorrow.
[317:50.76]Feels bad.
[317:52.72]Feels bad.
[317:56.94]SirK9, thanks for the 250.
[317:58.32]Local streamer gets scammed out of $100 for robot maid game, only to have also been scammed out of a functioning memory card.
[318:07.00]One of those statements is true.
[318:11.33]Thank you, though.
[318:13.95]Clink, again, 500 bits.
[318:17.21]Thank you, Clink.
[318:17.93]It actually makes me really sad that the memory card is giving you such a hard time right off the bat.
[318:21.47]I hope it doesn't affect your feelings of the game.
[318:23.51]No, it does not.
[318:26.03]That is not a Chibi-Robo problem.
[318:28.40]That is a... Memory card GameCube Wii problem.
[318:35.31]And we'll get it solved.
[318:36.71]Don't worry.
[318:38.55]And I'll be playing it tomorrow.
[318:41.61]Thank you, Clink.
[318:42.88]Don't worry.
[318:44.69]Hey, it's Boo.
[318:45.37]Thanks for the $2.50.
[318:46.27]Jermo, Sunday was my 20th birthday and a few friends and I went to Hash House Ogogo for dinner.
[318:51.58]It was as good as the first time.
[318:54.02]And the server gave our table a free caramel waffle with vanilla bean ice cream.
[318:57.90]Since he overheard it was my birthday.
[318:59.48]Thought it was nice.
[319:00.10]Hope you enjoy the game.
[319:01.24]Yeah, what a fantastic restaurant.
[319:05.71]What a place that I would go and eat at.
[319:07.85]At every single scenario that I was around for it.
[319:11.23]Sounds like a pretty great place to go.
[319:14.94]Look at how well they treat their customers.
[319:16.52]It's unbelievable.
[319:18.44]Spooky Biscuits, thanks for 10 community subs, Biscuits.
[319:22.14]Missed that earlier, but thank you.
[319:26.67]Mecha Murph, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[319:29.35]No message, just a bunch of money.
[319:31.19]Thank you.
[319:35.45]Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250.
[319:39.36]Jerma, I got into a debate in sub-chat about a certain sound you made.
[319:42.86]To me, it sounds like you are spitting, hucking some saliva and spitting.
[319:47.16]Others are saying you are drinking iced tea, but anyway, it sure does not sound normal.
[319:52.05]Wait.
[319:53.69]Why would you have an argument about this with people?
[319:55.39]What are you talking about?
[319:57.63]Come here.
[320:05.35]What are you talking about?
[320:06.05]Let me see.
[320:09.08]I'm going to make sure I can hear.
[320:12.96]Okay, turn this off.
[320:16.10]Alright, let's see if we can hear it.
[320:21.69]You know, I do whenever I'm cooking.
[320:24.41]Okay, um, you're talking about like the...
[320:36.03]I had a cup with ice.
[320:38.54]What you're hearing is there was a cup that I had that I was drinking out of through a straw, and there was ice at the bottom of the cup, and that's me shifting the straw around and making ice-straw-shifting movement sound.
[320:50.11]That's what that was.
[320:50.69]Appreciate the concern, though.
[320:52.59]Thank you.
[320:54.51]I wonder who won the argument.
[320:55.55]Hopefully it was you.
[320:56.55]Why, no.
[320:57.29]Is there somebody else in this chat?
[320:58.58]I have no opinion.
[321:00.62]Jaded!
[321:06.11]for the $5, 500 bits.
[321:08.77]Don't have the money currently to do this every month, but wanted to support.
[321:11.43]Been around since the Star days.
[321:13.47]Your development into streaming is some of the best stuff I've seen on Twitch.
[321:16.61]Big love for you, Jerm.
[321:20.46]Thanks, Jaded.
[321:23.34]Appreciate it.
[321:26.10]Everyone's saying, raid, raid, raid.
[321:27.44]Oh, wait, wait, we'll get there in a sec.
[321:31.94]We'll find somebody.
[321:34.50]Thank you, Jaden.
[321:35.28]I really appreciate that.
[321:37.04]I'm happy you still think this is interesting.
[321:40.27]Like, seven to eight plus years later.
[321:42.65]It's a long time.
[321:43.81]Thanks a lot.
[321:47.23]Esquilo, thanks for the 250.
[321:48.81]Jerma, love your streams.
[321:49.63]Please keep going.
[321:50.33]And you need to put some more exposition on your camera settings, because you always look so blue.
[321:56.90]Also, I didn't know you played Sasuke on Naruto Shippenden.
[322:01.96]That's fucking awesome.
[322:15.94]Oh my god, what is this?
[322:20.53]This was just saved here instead of the thing that I was trying to do What is this thing called?
[322:40.15]I don't get this.
[322:41.85]Maybe somebody can fill me in.
[322:43.20]I don't understand.
[322:46.64]Thank you, though.
[322:47.62]I don't get it.
[322:53.66]But thanks a lot.
[322:57.66]Thank you, Esquilo.
[322:59.18]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[323:00.30]Jeremy, don't know if you heard of the KFC donut chicken sandwich, but I got it tonight.
[323:04.82]I gotta say, it's actually good.
[323:07.12]Chat, don't DansGame.
[323:08.72]It's good.
[323:09.16]This will probably give me 20 kidney stones.
[323:12.06]I don't care anymore.
[323:15.04]Donut chicken sandwich.
[323:18.29]Okay, it probably... It probably is good.
[323:24.21]But I think that's a once a year sandwich.
[323:28.18]I wouldn't order that more than once every six months.
[323:39.02]I wouldn't make that a habit.
[323:41.90]Once in a lifetime.
[323:45.31]Why am I wearing the same shirt from the 500 sub video?
[323:48.93]Yep.
[323:51.13]Yep.
[323:51.65]That is the same shirt.
[323:53.05]It's the same exact tank top.
[323:54.78]I have not gotten rid of it.
[323:55.58]It's the same one.
[323:59.04]Really, really good eyes you've got there.
[324:00.42]That's correct.
[324:01.26]This is actually the exact same shirt I was wearing 10 years ago.
[324:05.45]Yep.
[324:06.94]Disgusting.
[324:07.62]I don't wash the shirt.
[324:10.33]Apparently, this has just been sitting on the ground for 10 years.
[324:16.95]But, thanks a lot, Hayley.
[324:18.35]The sandwich was good.
[324:20.89]Gnarly, thanks for $2.50.
[324:21.61]I bet you're just streaming Cooking Mama and the Easy Bake Oven stuff to get out of doing an actual cooking stream.
[324:27.50]I want to see you actually cook your secret pancake recipe.
[324:30.38]Have a good night.
[324:31.78]Well, thanks for spoiling it.
[324:34.42]That was supposed to be a pre-stream chat only thing and what are you doing?
[324:41.60]Leaking pre-stream chat spoilers.

[325:08.92]You're right.
[325:09.30]The stream is over.

[325:29.33]Also, I took this picture of your college graduation party.
[325:34.09]Please explain.
[325:34.83]I'm not showing that on stream.
[325:41.72]That's fucked up.
[325:44.80]It's like a guy shitting into a cooler with his pants off.
[325:48.37]I'm not showing it.
[325:49.55]Thanks for the $2.50.
[326:02.11]The cooking stream, I'd want to do it somewhere.

[326:08.63]There are ideas.
[326:09.35]Don't worry.
[326:11.48]It's not that bad.
[326:12.10]They're linking illegal images.

[326:41.24]I think I made a few of them tonight.
[326:45.17]I made them tonight.
[326:45.91]What were they?
[326:46.75]It was at least three or four of them.
[326:49.93]It was a few.
[326:53.31]I know, I know.

[327:20.14]Yeah.
[327:21.34]He's defending American cuisine.
[327:22.82]It's like barbecue.
[327:25.41]It's that Americans have the best barbecue, and that's... Look at every contest that's ever happened.
[327:34.02]always this huge fat guy with a smoker in his backyard.
[327:38.70]He wins every contest.
[327:53.87]No, no, no, no.
[327:55.77]Barbecue is... That's an American thing.
[328:01.18]We don't get to have very much.
[328:03.85]But true barbecue, that's here.
[328:09.00]That's here.
[328:13.72]That's here.
[328:23.63]Korean barbecue is better.
[328:25.17]They're both good, but that's American.
[328:28.53]American barbecue.
[328:31.01]Come on.
[328:31.61]Pulled pork.
[328:36.94]Smoked brisket.

[328:43.46]Goes to shake your hand.
[328:45.35]It's really dirty.
[328:46.73]And there's tons of dirt under his fingernails.
[328:48.99]You shake it anyways.
[328:50.11]And that's the best food you're ever gonna eat in your whole life.
[328:59.83]Anyways.
[329:00.66]Moving on.
[329:04.68]SirK9, thanks for the $2.50.
[329:08.32]Why does Cooking Mama turn into Pinwheel when you get a grate?
[329:11.47]Is she trying to remind Jerma that Pinwheel kicked his ass?
[329:15.39]Omega lul.
[329:17.93]I don't even... I have no idea what that even means.

[329:54.79]Can I get something along the lines of, that's a good item, yeah, to finish off my item filter?
[330:03.61]Is that like a sound pack thing and you can put in?
[330:10.48]Oh, that's a good item.
[330:12.00]Yeah.

[330:29.92]Snoozencopter, thanks for the 250.
[330:31.12]I have deep-set eyes as well and very big eyebrows on top of that.
[330:34.58]So when I was in high school, I was waiting in a line for the cafeteria behind a few kids, behind a few kids, a couple grades below me.
[330:41.52]They were talking to Goof and about not noticing their surroundings.
[330:44.91]Then I stepped forward because the line was moving and one of the kids jumped back and looked at me terrified.
[330:50.03]I was dumbfounded.
[330:50.81]Then he said, whoa, I thought you were going to punch me.
[330:52.99]He said, because I looked angry.
[331:01.60]That's deep-set eyes, big, high bra bone.
[331:05.42]I'm... I get it.
[331:07.82]Oh, I get it.
[331:10.11]Did you punch him afterwards?
[331:15.67]Innovators, thanks for the $2.50.
[331:17.27]You're American Psycho.
[331:21.03]Uh-huh.
[331:27.21]Let's change the scene.
[331:29.01]Why was that instant?
[331:30.45]That just freaked me out a little.
[331:32.87]Okay, why was that instant?
[331:34.71]Did I mess up my transition somehow?
[331:38.97]Let's run the credits.
[331:39.57]It was a flash punch, yeah.
[331:49.39]Thanks, everybody, for subbing.
[331:51.69]As always.
[331:55.71]I really appreciate it.
[331:58.35]A lot of you tonight.

[332:25.01]SirK9 for $2.50.
[332:26.71]Easy bake ovens are like actual sized ovens to Jerma.
[332:29.59]So... It would be one hell of a cooking stream.
[332:37.92]Is that how... I think that was word for word what you said.
[332:47.47]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[332:48.80]Smellyboy, thanks for 250.
[332:49.98]What is the best noodle to eat with fettuccine alfredo?
[332:52.48]Also, with or without the chicken?
[332:54.72]Well, you answered the question already.
[332:57.02]It would be fettuccine.
[333:01.86]And with chicken.
[333:07.14]With chicken.
[333:08.70]You gotta have something else besides cheese, sauce, and bread.
[333:17.28]Good luck.
[333:20.59]Red wall versus thanks for the 500 bits.
[333:22.37]Why is this not jermaSour?

[334:22.84]Big money.
[334:24.77]From, you guessed it, by lack of religion.
[334:29.25]5,000 bits, $50.
[334:30.27]Big money.
[334:32.85]You should do a nostalgia stream and turn the BS subsounds and Orson Welles back on.
[334:38.05]Maybe for like a fuckface stream one day.
[334:39.57]Maybe I'll just turn it on for when winks go on.
[334:43.99]Fucking like 50% off sale.
[334:49.37]I might just do, like, the clean-up stream.
[334:51.95]Where I play, like, two DLCs I said I was gonna stream.
[334:55.21]And, like, wink every five seconds.
[334:57.35]That would be, like, a total fuckface stream.
[335:06.13]This is a lot of shit.
[335:07.47]You know that.
[335:09.65]Thanks for the $50, though, dude.

[336:24.70]Gnarly.
[336:25.10]Thanks for the $2.50.
[336:28.32]Memory card issues remind me of when I had a GameCube as a kid and didn't own a memory card.
[336:32.75]I didn't know they were a thing.
[336:36.65]I thought you just had to restart the whole game every time.
[336:39.97]I have the opening cutscenes memorized from Mario Sunshine, Shadow the Hedgehog, Thousand Year Door, and Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[336:48.99]But I have no clue how those games end.
[336:52.65]I love the GameCube so much, and I'm happy to see you play it.
[336:55.03]That's, uh, sad.
[336:56.25]But so cute at the same time.
[337:04.22]Nah, we'll get it right, don't worry.
[337:07.50]But yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[337:09.48]I have a stack of GameCube games over here to play.
[337:13.26]We're gonna do them slowly, enjoy them all.
[337:16.20]These are classics over here.
[337:20.13]It's one of the reasons why I just was like, no, fuck it.
[337:21.91]I'll just do it tomorrow.
[337:23.45]I didn't want to sour my experience with Chibi-Robo being annoyed that my GameCube memory card that I bought corrupted itself for no reason.
[337:35.66]So I'm not going to let it sour me.
[337:39.90]Oh, the music.

[338:00.43]I do that a lot.
[338:01.15]Hi Jerma, didn't get to see most of the stream, but the ending was a really soothing way to end the night.
[338:06.69]Off-topic question I've wanted to ask, but do you plan on playing the Resident Evil 3 remake?
[338:10.34]Absolutely.
[338:11.56]Curious, because your Resident Evil 2 remake streams maybe get into the series finally.
[338:16.40]Be a treat to see you play it.
[338:17.58]I cannot wait for that game.
[338:18.64]I'm sure it's gonna be fantastic.

[338:43.64]Not gonna let him beat me.
[338:44.70]You're doing donation wars?
[338:47.02]Is that what this is?
[338:48.86]Mecha Murph is now... We don't have to have donation wars.
[338:53.00]They're all on the same team.
[338:59.73]Thanks for the 30 bucks, though.

[339:16.33]This is the thing?
[339:16.93]I played the first few levels of Rogue Squadron and Simpsons Hit and Run so many times, and my house got broken into and they stole my GameCube.
[339:23.97]Well, that ended really fucking horribly.
[339:28.57]Jesus.
[339:29.93]I'm sorry to hear that.
[339:36.95]Thanks for the $2.50, and... I'm gonna make sure I... Okay, this is freaking me out, because I'm gonna make sure I get... I'm gonna get, like, three memory cards.
[339:47.82]Uh, Phylacter just came in and said, sit down with $50.
[339:50.36]That's... No, that's...
[339:55.35]There's not a war when you're both playing on the same team.
[340:04.43]Thanks for the 100 bucks, Bylactory.
[340:05.39]10,000 bits in the last 10 minutes.
[340:18.65]A lot of money.
[340:20.01]Wink, wink, wink.
[340:21.23]By the way, I know, I know.
[340:22.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[340:23.51]Grave Embrace.
[340:24.45]Five dollars from Grave Embrace.
[340:26.23]Your name can be shortened to Jellebertson.
[340:29.76]Yeah.
[340:29.88]That's what people used to call me.
[340:33.12]We got a wink.
[340:34.20]Don't worry.
[340:34.68]Let's wink.
[340:41.60]Thanks a lot.
[340:45.98]We had another message come in right now.
[340:50.02]From Shrew Hefner.
[340:51.88]Thank you, Shrew.
[340:54.94]What did you... I'm...
[341:17.42]What the hell?
[341:18.22]What the heck?
[341:19.82]What?
[341:20.78]It's not even... What happened?
[341:22.90]Sorry, I blacked out.
[341:24.39]Um... Other places to eat in Vegas.
[341:27.07]Uh, Gordon Ramsay's steak... is... ridiculous.
[341:31.49]It's insane.
[341:33.67]If you want to drop a bunch of money on a special occasion, it's expensive.
[341:38.45]But holy shit.
[341:40.30]It is ridiculous.
[341:43.97]Could have been one of the single best pieces of meat I've ever eaten in my life.
[341:47.72]Was from Gordon Ramsay's day.
[341:56.89]I've only been there twice.
[341:59.17]And both were for very special occasions.
[342:05.07]Sponsored?
[342:05.65]That's not sponsored, that's reality.
[342:13.29]That's the only good restaurant that Gordon Ramsay has.
[342:15.55]I don't know how accurate that is, but Gordon Ramsay steak is phenomenal.
[342:21.47]Like, 10 out of 10.
[342:26.95]Mecha Murph just gave another $50.
[342:30.40]I will not sit down with 5,000 bits.
[342:31.94]That puts you at $110. $110.
[342:41.71]And it's a fight.
[342:43.92]No, not before.
[342:44.70]I'm going to end the stream, so they can't be a fight.
[342:48.72]Thank you, Mechamer, for the ridiculous amount of money.
[342:52.50]Appreciate it.
[342:57.39]That's so much money.
[342:58.87]One Jesus, thanks for the $2.50.
[343:00.19]If we keep donating, he will never eat.
[343:02.81]Well, that's accurate, but... Grave Embrace, thanks for $5.
[343:06.72]Just joined.
[343:07.38]Game sucks.
[343:08.14]There is no game.
[343:09.34]Thank you, Grave Embrace, for the $5.
[343:11.14]Pigeon, thanks for the $2.50.
[343:11.92]It's ass.
[343:30.47]You gotta get the steak.
[343:32.01]Don't get the meme menu item from Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.
[343:36.63]I know, like, the Beef Wellington.
[343:37.81]That's like the Gordon Ramsay loves Beef Wellington.
[343:40.17]Beef Wellington.
[343:40.79]No, no, no.
[343:41.11]Get a steak from Gordon Ramsay's steak.
[343:48.25]The meme menu.
[343:49.19]Ordering the Beef Wellington is ordering the meme.
[343:52.19]That's like the Gordon Ramsay meme menu item.
[343:59.75]Meme restaurant.
[344:00.77]No.
[344:01.25]Alright, alright.
[344:01.69]I gotta go.
[344:02.16]I gotta eat.
[344:04.60]I'm sorry you had a bad experience with the Meme Wellington.
[344:12.34]The mushroom risotto is fucking incredible, though.
[344:14.72]It's always their sticky toffee pudding.
[344:16.34]It's their dessert.
[344:17.13]It's the best restaurant ever.
[344:18.57]I hope you got it.
[344:19.83]C4G, thanks to the 250, it's like an event thing.
[344:23.43]Like this.
[344:23.93]Oh.
[344:25.53]What?
[344:27.78]Brave Embrace, thanks for the $3 and there's a Twitch clip.
[344:31.04]Why don't we click it and stay here forever?
[344:32.83]This game sucks.
[344:37.77]How would you know that if you just got here?
[344:40.61]Hey, just opened up the browser.
[344:42.17]Hey, this game sucks.
[344:44.53]Really?
[344:46.01]How would you know that?
[344:46.67]Yeah.
[344:47.40]I agree with past Jeremy.
[344:49.24]Yeah, I agree.
[344:58.09]Finally, C4G250.
[345:00.11]Also, hey, Jerma, why did you pronounce my girlfriend's name as Pen Yellow?
[345:03.17]I don't know.
[345:03.61]Because my brain is fucking scrambled eggs.
[345:06.21]Alright, who's streaming right now?
[345:14.19]Who's streaming?
[345:15.11]Let's do... Let me go to my Twitch dashboard.
[345:18.17]Let's see who's streaming.
[345:19.13]Who's even live right now?
[345:28.76]Okay.
[345:33.66]We got... I barely follow, like, anybody.
[345:43.29]We got Vinny.
[345:43.99]We got Kryken.
[345:46.73]We got... Nova's playing GTA 5.
[345:50.87]Ooh.
[345:53.03]Ooh, I don't follow anybody.
[345:54.27]Who else is streaming?
[346:05.99]Criken?
[346:06.27]Yeah, we haven't said hello.
[346:07.35]Let's go say hi to Criken.
[346:08.55]What's he doing?
[346:10.41]He has rat in his title automatically, like, that we show up.
[346:15.50]Raid?
[346:15.86]Doctor Disrespect.
[346:19.44]Hey!
[346:20.06]Hey, dude, here comes a raid!
[346:21.38]It's Doctor Disrespect!
[346:26.36]Ugh.
[346:38.48]Raid my friend.
[346:39.75]No, no, I'm not raiding anybody's friends today.
[346:41.87]That got messy real quick.
[346:45.49]Alright, let's just, let's, let's raid Criken.
[346:49.33]Raid Ster?
[346:50.17]Wait, Star's not streaming.
[346:51.31]What?
[346:51.51]No, he's not.
[346:52.61]I would be shocked.
[346:53.55]Is he streaming right now?
[346:54.45]This is late for him.
[346:55.68]No, he's not.
[346:57.52]Oh, I got lied to.
[346:58.26]I would have.
[347:08.83]Oh, yeah, it's been a while since we've said hello to Criken.
[347:14.21]He's got Rat in the title, like I said.
[347:15.60]You'll love it.
[347:19.48]He's stat-boosting his friends.
[347:28.97]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[347:30.35]Goodbye.
[347:32.05]Goodbye.
[347:32.59]See you tomorrow.
