[ve:60.16.100]

[00:44.72]Thank you.
[08:35.69]We'll be right back.
[11:49.55]Hey!
[11:51.73]Whoa!
[11:52.21]Dama!
[13:48.25]I don't want anybody to see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[15:27.73]Look at these.
[15:28.97]It's a massive girl.
[18:34.62]Thank you.
[20:28.58]Can't read without these.
[21:53.15]I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.
[21:54.33]I would say like the lip I was doing, I was just going.
[22:11.14]Woo!
[22:33.09]Just a little too big.
[24:52.50]Can't read without these.
[26:17.01]I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.
[26:18.29]Who could see that clip I was just doing?
[26:19.77]I'm just going...
[26:56.99]Just a little too big.
[32:49.70]Oh, a house.
[32:52.74]I broke the watch.
[32:54.38]We should have started like five minutes ago.
[32:57.46]We had to tape the watch on my hand.
[33:00.99]I was putting it on, I was panicking, and the thing just like shattered in my hands.
[33:05.85]But anyways, hi, welcome to day two of the dollhouse.
[33:09.51]Do you need an introduction?
[33:10.61]Should I give you an introduction?
[33:12.41]Or do you already know how this works?
[33:13.81]You should by now.
[33:14.43]Why don't we go take a look inside?
[33:16.49]Oh my God, I look fucking awful.
[33:19.29]I was just like, oh God.
[33:21.89]I'm gonna be so self-conscious now.
[33:23.85]I don't wear this shit.
[33:25.48]You understand?
[33:26.28]In my own home, I don't wear this, because I'm embarrassed about how my neck and shoulders and stomach come out.
[33:32.46]And I think you can see my nipples through the shirt, but I'm gonna try to do my best to make sure you can't see that.
[33:36.96]Let's go in the house.
[33:42.96]Seems to have been cleaned up.
[33:44.36]You notice something in the trash out there?
[33:45.89]Because I'm not sleeping on that fucking mattress.
[33:48.72]That's not going to happen.
[33:49.62]I'm not sleeping on that.
[33:51.64]Because it's actually dirty.
[33:53.28]Actually dirty.
[33:54.00]Actually, you know, I look like a... I look like a fucking idiot.
[34:03.26]You know the bathroom.
[34:05.52]Probably pretty well at this point, I would assume.
[34:08.20]I love this bathroom.
[34:09.94]Although I could use a little bit more stuff.
[34:11.90]Please be aware.
[34:13.10]You are in control of 98% of everything that happens on this stream.
[34:17.81]Just be aware of that.
[34:20.85]Should we check this door?
[34:23.11]What do you think?
[34:24.63]Should I go in here?
[34:26.13]Does this door work?
[34:28.13]We'll find out.
[34:33.49]I can't open it, it's locked.
[34:39.96]Oh, that's where the bed is.
[34:41.82]That's right, I built it.
[34:43.28]It was broken, but that's where I decided to put it.
[34:49.14]because you got it for me at the end of the stream.
[34:50.84]It took me like six hours to build it.
[34:56.64]This is nice and comfy.
[35:02.09]Can somebody like, it just, I actually kind of like how this looks.
[35:08.71]Can we see?
[35:09.95]Can you get it?
[35:11.47]Can I like home shopping network this thing?
[35:15.13]It's so stupid.
[35:17.49]I feel like, I feel like that mouse, who I'm not gonna say on a stream like this, I feel like that mouse wears this kind of stuff.
[35:24.94]I feel like he has like 30 of these.
[35:27.14]But we never see him wear it.
[35:27.94]I guarantee he hasn't.
[35:31.38]Welcome back though.
[35:32.82]Actually, you know, from the front, from the front it looks okay.
[35:36.54]But from the side it doesn't.
[35:39.35]I need to like get a bigger chest.
[35:41.99]But I got like these, look at these arms.
[35:43.53]I could like, I'm gonna, I can go like that.
[35:46.91]I love the bedroom.
[35:49.47]You've got more choices now, don't you?
[35:56.63]Toilet, I don't have to go, but just so you can be aware that it is available.
[36:01.50]Eventually, I probably want to take these gloves off.
[36:08.08]Enjoy the game.
[36:09.56]Good luck.
[36:11.42]I got full bars, which means I can do this.
[36:18.80]That's embarrassing.
[36:19.52]I just did that.
[36:19.98]How many people are here?
[36:21.76]How many people are here?
[36:25.10]That was actually pretty embarrassing to do with this many people.
[36:28.48]73,000 people just watched me do that.
[36:29.40]That's embarrassing.
[36:31.04]Back during school plays, there'd be like fucking 40 people in the audience.
[36:55.58]No, I'm not peeing on them.
[36:57.56]I'm not peeing on the flowers.
[37:00.54]Why is that the piss sound?
[37:02.45]That's not water flowers.
[37:07.73]I'm going to stand like this so people don't think that's what's happening.
[37:11.65]I enjoyed that very much, though.
[37:13.51]I did.
[37:15.83]I'm telling you, from the front, this looks good.
[37:19.86]Wait a minute.
[37:20.28]We're going to do the same joke from the other day.
[37:29.18]But what I was going to say is, back when I was a young, young boy, there'd be school plays.
[37:36.82]You're in like the fourth grade, the fifth grade.
[37:40.84]Only people's parents came to that shit, right?
[37:43.96]Maybe the principal, maybe the old lady that played the piano during the entire show.
[37:49.07]And, like, she would just, every scene, it would be like... That lady was, like, super into it, and I kind of wish we had one of those ladies, but we don't.
[37:58.03]But the difference is, it's not 40 people's parents, it's 70,000 people.
[38:03.65]I don't know how many of you are.
[38:04.61]Actually, I think my mother is watching.
[38:06.63]I'm going to go lie in the bed.
[38:11.20]I'm going to go check the bed out.
[38:16.65]Is it parasocial Andy?
[38:20.57]What?
[38:22.53]Let me check the bed out.
[38:28.66]Okay.
[38:30.44]There it is.
[38:30.78]There's the first one.
[38:32.17]There's the first one.
[38:43.35]If I, okay, there's a, I actually talked, I talked about the fart thing and I said five farts an hour, an hour.
[38:49.40]There's more than five farts an hour.
[38:51.92]So it's gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[38:53.53]It was five fart sounds an hour.
[38:57.65]There was one, I want you to keep track.
[39:13.24]1984.
[39:13.36]Watch out for that manhole.
[39:34.29]You see the mattress?
[39:35.43]There it is.
[39:40.17]I'm in the right clothes for this.
[39:45.37]Not sleeping on this.
[39:47.30]It's funny, we actually talked about this after day one, and I'm like, not a chance that I actually lie on this.
[39:56.04]No way.
[40:03.43]Oh, we got the popcorn maker, except it doesn't do anything, because I don't want to get electrocuted.
[40:26.91]Check mail.
[40:32.01]Sure.
[40:32.93]Why not?
[40:35.85]Mail.
[40:39.97]Time to check the mail.
[40:49.42]What's in the mail today?
[40:50.36]Let's find out.
[40:57.18]This is somebody's shoe that's here.
[41:00.16]Somebody actually on set here, this is their shoe.
[41:03.44]I don't know whose it is, but I don't know why it's in here.
[41:12.41]What is it?
[41:14.81]Has somebody worn this in the last few days?
[41:16.91]Did I just get money?
[41:23.92]There's 20 bucks in the shoe.
[41:28.25]Who would do this?
[41:29.66]What kind of fucked up neighborhood is this?
[41:37.36]Thanks for the $20.
[41:40.52]What did we start with, 300?
[41:41.68]So that's what, 320?
[41:42.36]How much money?
[41:46.71]40, what?
[41:50.07]I thought we started with $300.
[41:55.20]Oh, they bought the upgraded house, right.
[41:56.78]But we don't have any money?
[41:57.68]How are we supposed to get any money?
[41:59.98]How are they gonna buy anything?
[42:01.22]You gotta send me to work.
[42:02.02]Don't fuck it up.
[42:03.24]I'm talking to you.
[42:06.95]Remember, I have to go to work to make money.
[42:08.63]If you don't send me to work, then it's not gonna happen.
[42:17.03]Oh!
[42:19.23]Got you.
[42:21.41]I actually hit myself in the head.
[42:26.56]like a joke and I didn't fucking get it right.
[42:34.42]My knee was in the wrong place and that actually just hit me right in the forehead.
[42:39.86]I do actually feel pretty, I need to take a shower.
[42:42.38]Let me get in here.
[42:48.58]Don't close that.
[42:54.24]So you guys figured it out.
[42:57.16]You got to keep these bars green.
[42:58.36]Otherwise, how am I going to get promoted?
[43:00.34]How are you going to make more money?
[43:01.20]How are you going to be able to get more stuff in the house?
[43:05.42]You can't unless you actually play and get me there.
[43:10.65]I want green bars.
[43:18.49]Coming up.
[43:20.35]Coming up.
[43:33.95]What?
[43:35.47]I'm getting a little tired though.
[43:39.61]Starting to wane a little.
[43:42.91]I want cool items.
[43:44.31]I want fun stuff.
[43:45.75]I want things to lie down on.
[43:47.11]I want things to play with.
[43:48.54]I don't just want... What was that?
[43:52.24]Go to work?
[43:53.00]I missed work by like four hours already.
[43:56.62]Go to work?
[43:59.36]Alright, I'm going to work.
[44:02.06]Alright, fine.
[44:03.32]I'm going to work.
[44:06.06]I'm coming.
[44:42.21]Thanks for the ride.
[44:44.57]Goodbye.
[44:46.70]Goodbye.
[44:48.78]Goodbye.
[44:50.68]Goodbye.
[44:52.48]Goodbye.
[44:56.30]That just made me wait.
[44:57.08]That just made me tired.
[45:00.68]That just brought my energy to zero.
[45:03.48]Why did I do that?
[45:07.51]It wasn't working for like six or seven hours.
[45:10.05]It was doing the goodbye.
[45:12.33]Like five times is what made me tired.
[45:16.09]I'm exhausted though.
[45:21.35]Tired and a little hungry.
[45:25.29]Okay.
[45:27.55]At least we made some money.
[45:28.31]I'm hungry though.
[45:30.80]And how much money is in the account now?
[45:32.20]200, 140?
[45:37.38]I'm going to my bedroom.
[45:38.27]I haven't been able to sit in there for very long.
[45:40.47]I've got a bathroom that's bigger than the bedroom, which is a little odd.
[45:47.87]I'm gonna lock myself out of one of these rooms eventually.
[45:55.17]Oh man, tired.
[46:02.42]Make a phone call.
[46:05.02]Who am I calling?
[46:08.62]Call who?
[46:10.68]Who am I calling?
[46:14.91]I got a call?
[46:17.57]No sleeping?
[46:18.45]What are you talking about?
[46:19.77]Let me call mom.
[46:35.89]Ma, yeah, it's me.
[46:39.29]Yeah.
[46:40.73]Yeah, it's been an interesting day or two.
[46:44.15]It's actually really remarkable that I can even talk to you, Ma, considering that I just pulled the line out of the wall.
[46:48.85]So this is really good, some kind of alien technology, which is interesting.
[46:53.45]Oh, yeah, no, hi.
[46:54.19]Hello, sorry, I forgot to say, like, hi.
[46:56.10]How are you?
[46:57.58]Yeah, it's good to hear your voice.
[46:58.98]You're the only person I know.
[47:01.34]That's kind of interesting.
[47:03.16]Yeah.
[47:05.24]Yeah, and so I...
[49:14.31]We'll be right back.
[53:44.63]Ow.
[53:52.75]What?
[53:53.29]Yeah.
[53:54.74]Oh, this, right, right, right.
[53:56.42]This, this shit.
[53:58.68]That's right.
[54:13.35]That's hilarious.
[54:16.27]Okay.
[54:21.29]That couch is fucking ugly.
[54:25.28]Ma?
[54:25.44]Are you still on the phone?
[54:29.50]Ma?
[54:29.74]I don't know.
[54:32.92]I hopefully she thinks I'm alright.
[54:34.88]Let me put this back.
[54:36.54]What is... What is this?
[54:41.80]Can I get this back on?
[54:44.20]Yeah, whatever.
[54:44.60]It'll stay.
[54:47.79]Oh, yes.
[54:48.55]Oh, I love that.
[54:50.81]Oh, sofa.
[54:52.11]Ew.
[54:53.31]Yuck.
[54:54.87]Yuck.
[54:59.37]What is this?
[55:11.14]I don't want that.
[55:14.63]I want one piece of singular bread.
[55:24.80]I feel awful.
[55:25.58]I hate sleeping on the ground.
[55:27.84]Let me go to bed, alright?
[55:29.64]Like, okay, there's a sofa here now.
[55:31.22]There's a bed in the other room.
[55:33.64]Don't make me use the phone.
[55:35.12]If my energy's low and I'm just, I'm hangry, alright?
[55:38.36]Just let me talk to you for a second.
[55:40.27]If you put me in the bed and let me go to sleep, then this won't happen.
[55:44.13]You'll have plenty of opportunity and I'm gonna piss my shit my pants.
[55:53.89]I'm just eating a piece of bread.
[55:54.97]I'm just, I'm eating one piece of bread.
[56:02.69]It's good.
[56:05.67]It's actually pretty good.
[56:07.64]This is a good bread.
[56:10.46]What is this?
[56:10.76]What kind of bread is this?
[56:13.08]Oh, it's multigrain.
[56:15.20]I eat multigrain bread.
[56:17.28]I don't.
[56:17.54]I actually think that stuff's gross.
[56:24.27]Okay, that was good.
[56:26.19]Delicious.
[56:30.71]Don't just leave it.
[56:32.57]Disgusting.
[56:33.19]I'm going to do a thing that everybody does.
[56:44.11]What?
[56:45.06]Work?
[56:45.42]I'm going to go to work?
[56:47.58]Wait.
[56:55.78]Wait for me.
[57:38.90]One just full piece of white bread.
[57:41.46]I've been at work all day trying to eat.
[57:46.51]I've been chewing this single piece of white bread for fucking six hours.
[57:51.67]It's like eating saltines.
[57:57.52]Everybody at work thought I was chewing gum.
[58:00.41]No, I ate a whole piece of white bread before I came in.
[58:04.89]They were like, dude, what did you have for breakfast today?
[58:07.93]No, I just went like this with a piece of white bread.
[58:11.41]And they all were like, do you want to go to McDonald's?
[58:13.11]I'm like, I don't know.
[58:13.99]No.
[58:21.73]I'm awful.
[58:22.21]I'm fucking horrible.
[58:23.13]I feel awful.
[58:25.23]Ugh.
[58:35.44]I can see it.
[58:36.19]I can see it.
[58:48.28]Please help me.
[58:49.84]Please help me.
[58:50.74]Please, I can see it.
[58:53.10]I can literally see the fucking toilet in front of me.
[58:55.56]What was that?
[58:59.24]What was that?
[59:01.45]Come at the door.
[59:12.82]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[59:14.94]I'm coming!
[59:18.27]Drama!
[59:20.29]Drama!
[59:22.31]It's Uncle Ted!
[59:23.73]It's been so long!
[59:25.81]Oh my god, what?
[59:27.93]What is he doing here?
[59:28.74]I went to spring training, I told your mother I was going.
[59:33.46]What is he?
[59:33.84]Nice couch you got here.
[59:35.28]You got good taste.
[59:36.78]I like it, I like it.
[59:37.62]He's dead.
[59:39.22]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Uncle Ted, give me a hug.
[59:40.76]What do you mean, what are you doing here?
[59:41.76]Give me a hug, give me a hug.
[59:42.64]Ted, no.
[59:43.58]He's so, he's so fucking cold, he's freezing.
[59:46.06]Well, you act like you've seen a ghost.
[59:47.33]What's the matter with you?
[59:49.51]Huh?
[59:49.81]Let's go.
[59:51.39]I went to my house.
[59:52.01]Let's talk business.
[59:52.97]I went to my house.
[59:54.21]You know what's there?
[59:55.65]Nothing.
[59:56.23]I got no furniture.
[59:58.17]That looks familiar.
[59:59.29]That looks familiar.
[60:00.35]I don't know what god I angered.
[60:01.79]I'm sorry, but I'm afraid.
[60:02.61]You like my... Oh, you like my couch?
[60:04.73]So you got a couch just like mine.
[60:05.63]That's beautiful.
[60:06.29]I love it.
[60:06.57]I love it.
[60:06.77]He's a ghost.
[60:07.11]He's a fucking ghost.
[60:07.83]I haven't had a beer in about a... He's a ghost.
[60:09.57]Fifteen... Gemma!
[60:13.03]Hey!
[60:13.49]Hey!
[60:13.83]Uncle Ted!
[60:14.43]You're gonna pee so bad.
[60:16.03]Uncle Ted!
[60:16.95]There's a fucking ghost in my house.
[60:18.59]This motherfucker, he's dead.
[60:19.89]Oh, I just... He's still at home.
[60:24.59]Gemma!
[60:25.17]Is that the bathroom?
[60:26.67]No, no, no.
[60:28.72]You in the bathroom.
[60:29.18]I need to do something about this.
[60:30.86]He has to pass on.
[60:31.74]I got all the time in the world.
[60:33.10]Ghost of the goddamn walking dead.
[60:36.72]Take your time.
[60:37.44]I know what a good, you know, release feels like.
[60:40.90]Sometimes it takes a little while.
[60:44.22]Lord.
[60:45.22]Start at 100.
[60:45.74]Come back.
[60:46.24]Pass him on to the other world.
[60:47.43]I don't know what happened.
[60:48.95]I don't know what God I angered.
[60:49.83]I don't know what I did.
[60:50.49]I don't know who I'm angering.
[60:51.85]Poseidon.
[60:52.81]Zeus.
[60:53.09]I don't know.
[60:54.51]Yeah.
[60:55.09]Gemma, Gemma, Gemma.
[60:57.63]If we could get him to the other side, that'd be fantastic, because I don't want to be haunted anymore.
[61:00.49]I want to pass on wealth.
[61:01.69]Those are my spoons.
[61:04.47]Those are my spoons.
[61:05.21]That one's like my couch, and there's my couch.
[61:06.87]I'm going to shit my pants.
[61:16.42]I got that one.
[61:19.50]I got that one at Dollywood.
[61:22.52]Hey.
[61:23.02]I love my Branson.
[61:24.16]Hey, so how are you?
[61:25.70]I'm fine.
[61:27.33]Are you ready for Uncle Ted?
[61:29.19]You're not supposed to be here, Ted.
[61:31.37]Why can't I make a call?
[61:32.15]I'm not supposed to be here.
[61:33.19]Well, I had to get your address off somebody because your mother, your freaking mother, my sister, my house is empty of furniture.
[61:39.46]But this looks familiar.
[61:40.44]That looks familiar.
[61:41.50]And those are my spoons.
[61:42.62]I got that one at Dollywood.
[61:43.84]Yeah, I'm going to need a service.
[61:44.86]I got that one at... I've got a ghost that needs to go to the other goddamn side.
[61:47.98]Space Mountain.
[61:49.97]He's hot.
[61:50.31]Are you?
[61:51.71]Come on.
[61:52.81]Yeah, you come as soon as you can.
[61:54.37]Talk to me.
[61:55.51]Ted, Ted, how are you?
[61:57.09]Who was on the phone?
[61:57.69]I was just calling my friend Granite Riepleson.
[62:02.91]Granite Riepleson.
[62:04.05]Yeah, they're an old family friend.
[62:05.71]You played soccer with him, didn't you?
[62:07.79]I went to one of your games and you played soccer with him.
[62:09.68]I did, I did.
[62:10.44]Anything that you need to say before you move on to the other world?
[62:14.71]No, I'm good.
[62:15.93]There's no money hidden under any mattresses?
[62:19.13]No, actually, I had no money.
[62:20.19]Like, somebody cleaned out my accounts when I was at spring training.
[62:23.27]Let me get the door.
[62:24.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:26.23]Just stay there for a minute.
[62:27.11]You know, this is a new place, but you've done wonders with it.
[62:29.45]Stay there for just a second.
[62:32.02]I'm here for Ted.
[62:34.50]Please come in.
[62:35.34]Please come in.
[62:36.04]He's in there.
[62:39.28]Where's this go?
[62:41.64]Yeah, he's over here.
[62:42.30]He's having some trouble getting over to the other side, if you could.
[62:45.78]Hi, how are you?
[62:46.76]Hello.
[62:47.14]This is my friend.
[62:47.84]You're going to just, by the way, I don't think I've ever said it about you.
[62:51.54]It was just a joke.
[62:53.04]If there's anything you need to say to me, should I know anything about anything?
[62:58.50]Dress up?
[62:58.88]Is this dress up?
[62:59.90]I love dress up.
[63:01.02]Yeah, yeah, it is.
[63:01.96]Yeah, okay.
[63:04.31]It's time for you to come home, Ted.
[63:07.26]It's time.
[63:07.72]Well, there's no furniture in my home.
[63:09.68]No, Ted, not that kind of home.
[63:12.60]It's time for the long farewell, Ted.
[63:17.03]I'm feeling kind of cold.
[63:18.85]Shh.
[63:20.33]No more tears.
[63:25.39]Come on now.
[63:26.29]Here we go.
[63:27.23]There you are.
[63:27.79]That's right.
[63:29.13]I'm not dead.
[63:31.03]You're not dead, yes.
[63:32.15]They all say that, Ted.
[63:33.53]They all say that.
[63:34.99]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[63:36.15]Jerma can't help you now, Ted.
[63:38.63]Fucking family.
[63:40.47]Come on.
[63:41.15]I've got a spot picked out for you right here.
[63:44.18]Come on, Ted.
[63:45.52]Right this way.
[63:46.60]There you go.
[63:48.80]Shh.
[63:49.84]I'm going to take good care of you, Ted.
[63:52.70]Off we go now.
[64:00.33]This is the worst I've ever felt in my whole life.
[64:04.49]What did he fucking do?
[64:05.76]Why did he come here?
[64:08.38]Fucking haunted by my Uncle Ted while I tried to make amends and shit.
[64:12.12]I don't even know.
[64:16.30]I have to go to the bathroom.
[64:25.16]It's here!
[64:25.76]Press it!
[64:59.36]Jesus!
[65:04.00]Holy goodness!
[65:07.32]It's a hole, another one.
[65:15.24]Oh, the water's starting to come up over the lip.
[65:19.82]Okay.
[65:28.50]I don't fucking care.
[65:35.55]Oh, you know, in FTP, a lot, and it just hurts still.
[65:39.47]It hurts, like my, up here hurts, like right here hurts.
[65:43.31]All the way like I'm here, like this is killing me.
[65:46.47]Oh, like I emptied everything, but it's just like this pain now.
[65:49.45]Are you gonna let that go again?
[65:50.66]Oh, thank you.
[65:56.40]Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
[65:58.26]Thank you so much.
[65:59.92]And I'm gonna say a prayer for Ted too, because being haunted by somebody is just, it's a very unnerving ass thing.
[66:13.71]Man, I'm going to have to write about that in my blog tomorrow.
[66:19.84]What should I title it?
[66:22.68]My uncle going through the great beyond.
[66:26.02]Something like that.
[66:26.62]It's fucked up.
[66:31.26]What did I ever do to that motherfucker?
[66:32.55]I didn't do anything.
[66:34.09]I got money in the mail from him.
[66:35.49]That's it.
[66:38.59]It was just a thing.
[66:39.79]It was something my mother called me and sold me.
[66:43.64]What the fuck?
[66:44.25]I don't know why I'm getting haunted by him.
[66:46.45]Thank God he's on the way to the other side.
[66:48.09]That's ten times better.
[66:54.05]A hundred times better.
[67:14.78]That's not even fun anymore.
[67:19.24]This is a nice watch though.
[67:23.65]I don't want the clowns to come back.
[67:26.13]Please do something.
[67:27.13]I don't want the clowns to come back today.
[67:28.71]Oh, yay!
[67:41.56]catch butterflies, but they don't want to be caught.
[67:44.85]They want to be free.
[67:47.59]Butterflies don't want to be caught.
[67:48.49]They want to be free.
[67:49.23]I'm sorry.
[67:54.59]No, I don't want to.
[67:55.36]Let me see.
[68:05.28]There's one over here.
[68:07.08]Oh, that's a monarch.
[68:16.39]It's beautiful.
[68:17.71]That's beautiful.
[68:19.71]I think that might be a moth, but it's okay.
[68:25.07]It sounds like I'm getting hit by a wave.
[68:28.83]It's like, hold on.
[68:30.23]That's kind of funny.
[68:31.36]That's funny I can hear that.
[68:32.84]That's kind of funny.
[68:40.80]I can't move around too much.
[68:41.76]This microphone, like, fucks up.
[68:45.70]I'm tired, though.
[68:48.91]Oh, what's that butterfly?
[68:50.75]Oh, I think that's a green-tailed sparrow back.
[68:54.95]Wow.
[68:56.97]Maybe I should keep him.
[69:01.06]Actual psycho?
[69:04.28]I'm fucking tired.
[69:06.74]Doorbell.
[69:08.42]I didn't press it.
[69:22.06]I feel better.
[69:24.58]I feel better.
[69:25.46]That's two.
[69:26.64]We have 30 minutes or 45 minutes to go before you can do three more.
[69:38.65]Life and death.
[69:43.75]When somebody comes into the world, they're essentially created.
[69:47.77]And when they're taken away from the world, they are destroyed.
[69:52.34]So therefore, all of us at some point during our lives witness creation and destruction in one life.
[70:02.21]That's crazy to think about that.
[70:05.15]And also like in the fact that, are we even real?
[70:08.91]Is this a simulation?
[70:11.43]Like this is a simulation, but is this a simulation inside of a simulation?
[70:17.68]Could we in fact wake up from this simulation into another simulation?
[70:23.18]Because we're doing it now.
[77:33.73]Oh.
[77:38.78]Ugh.
[77:40.86]Have I eaten?
[77:41.38]When was the last time I ate?
[77:43.00]I don't know.
[77:45.48]Fuck it.
[77:46.58]I'm not ready.
[77:47.06]Is that gas?
[77:52.92]I don't know.
[77:58.76]Ugh, I'm hungry as shit.
[78:03.91]This is not a bad couch.
[78:04.97]Where did I get this from?
[78:07.29]Oh, that's right.
[78:10.23]Cool, okay.
[78:15.21]Oh.
[78:16.19]This is a really good unbranded beer.
[78:24.85]I'm hungry.
[78:31.85]I feel like I've got like a stomach ache too.
[78:33.29]I don't know why.
[78:33.69]When was the last time I ate?
[78:58.60]What is it, mystery?
[79:00.94]Mystery box?
[79:03.34]Ow.
[79:05.14]A mystery?
[79:05.96]Please handle with care.
[79:07.24]Do not drop.
[79:10.26]Something fragile in here?
[79:15.20]Well, if it's fragile, I don't want to mess with it.
[79:18.27]This is pretty cool though.
[79:20.09]I would assume my fun meter is high!
[79:26.19]It's fucking stools.
[79:33.78]else in here there's a lot of paper in here but there oh this is a lot you know can I say something real quick real quick
[79:50.27]The amount of packing material that people put into boxes is getting a little ridiculous, okay?
[79:57.04]I have ordered CDs before that have come in a box this big, that have this much packing material, and then what am I as the consumer to do about it?
[80:11.49]You could literally like throw a fucking CD into the wall and it's gonna be fine.
[80:15.29]You don't have to put like 600 fucking pounds of paper in here.
[80:24.05]Ah, stool.
[80:34.97]Cereal.
[80:55.30]I'll take some cereal, that sounds good to me.
[80:56.96]I'm not cutting a tomato.
[81:12.74]That's me pouring a soda.
[81:16.72]Oh, it's liquid cereal.
[81:18.26]Do I have any utensils?
[81:22.49]Oh, I'm starving though.
[81:24.05]Thank goodness.
[81:33.49]What was that?
[81:37.03]Good thing I'm eating.
[81:38.93]Eat real quick.
[81:56.32]Hello?
[82:01.57]What?
[82:05.95]Uncle Ted is dead.
[82:07.91]And I got an inheritance from Uncle Ted.
[82:11.95]This is from the insurance company, what?
[82:15.49]Didn't Uncle Ted die like three days ago?
[82:17.15]Two days ago?
[82:17.49]What do you mean?
[82:22.26]My mother called me and said,
[82:25.83]I got $2,000 added to my account?
[82:30.11]But I thought that, I thought, what, is this like just litigation stuff?
[82:32.89]Like I got it like a week, two, three weeks later or something?
[82:35.31]No, he's confirmed dead yesterday.
[82:41.67]Oh.
[82:44.13]Okay.
[82:46.12]Interesting.
[82:46.52]Thank you for the, thank you for the reply and thanks for the email.
[82:48.96]What?
[82:55.04]2,000 smackaroos, though.
[82:56.82]I'll take that one.
[83:00.24]Is he dead?
[83:00.76]What?
[83:01.04]I thought he died.
[83:01.56]Oh, thank you!
[83:05.78]Oh, thank you!
[83:09.76]This cereal's actually pretty good.
[83:17.86]Those of you that don't know, I don't eat on set.
[83:19.64]This is the only food that they give me.
[83:30.37]Can I sell this watch?
[83:37.99]I don't want to leave trash around.
[83:48.20]That's better.
[83:48.68]I need to put a trash barrel, put a trash can in there.
[83:53.62]Why are the people just at my house?
[83:56.77]Stop coming to my house!
[83:58.79]I haven't eaten breakfast!
[84:02.01]Oh my god, alright.
[84:06.88]Who is that?
[84:07.34]Hi darling, hello.
[84:12.40]Hi.
[84:13.76]I'm Edna, by the way, your neighbor.
[84:17.84]What are you doing here?
[84:19.49]You'll have to forgive me.
[84:21.51]I was busy with my cat's sweater yesterday, but this is for you.
[84:26.37]Welcome to the neighborhood.
[84:27.80]Thank you.
[84:29.28]Welcome to the neighborhood.
[84:30.40]Let's see the house.
[84:33.77]Oh, my.
[84:35.71]Oh, wow.
[84:36.44]You've really done nothing with the place.
[84:38.82]Okay.
[84:40.38]Is this what you kids call a house these days?
[84:45.70]Thank you.
[84:46.10]Is this a basket?
[84:46.84]Yeah, I'll take that back later, but you put that wherever you'd like.
[84:51.62]That's for you.
[84:52.89]There are apples.
[84:53.61]There's fresh fruit in here.
[84:55.09]Yes, that's from the farmer's market.
[84:57.23]It's a stone's throw away.
[84:59.07]If you ever get hungry, you can go down there.
[85:01.53]There's no worms.
[85:03.77]The worms, it's a very big mix-up.
[85:05.76]My cat is the one with worms, but there are no worms in the apples.
[85:09.80]I can't have any of these.
[85:11.28]No, those are for you.
[85:12.34]Those are for you, sweetie.
[85:13.10]But you're taking the basket.
[85:14.42]Yes, it's my basket.
[85:16.00]Actually, my first grandchild was born, and we brought it home in that basket.
[85:21.79]Okay, that's really fantastic.
[85:24.41]What was your name again?
[85:26.03]Edna.
[85:26.95]And what is this?
[85:29.31]The placement's a little odd, but you can sit down if you want to.
[85:33.32]In your kitchen.
[85:35.12]I just moved in, and it was really nice to see you, though.
[85:39.24]Have you seen these spoons?
[85:41.37]Yes, I have seen those spoons.
[85:42.55]My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.
[85:43.61]Did they come with your Uncle who?
[85:46.37]My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.
[85:47.95]You wet the bed?
[85:48.83]Okay.
[85:49.11]No, it was really nice to see you.
[85:50.33]You know, that happens sometimes.
[85:52.11]People wet the bed.
[85:53.05]It's perfectly normal.
[85:54.43]Don't worry about that.
[85:56.75]Yeah, sometimes they do if they're under the age of six.
[86:00.11]I'm a 35-year-old man.
[86:02.08]How old are you?
[86:04.44]I'm 35.
[86:05.18]35, really?
[86:05.54]Okay, you look more like a 15 with those gloves, but that's alright.
[86:10.46]Do you mind if I sit down?
[86:12.56]Please do, please.
[86:14.36]And...
[86:19.58]No.
[86:20.30]No.
[86:21.12]No.
[86:21.28]No.
[86:21.50]Oh, my.
[86:22.94]What are you... I just have a bad migraine.
[86:25.28]I'm okay.
[86:26.76]I want to say... You look lovely.
[86:29.91]Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
[86:31.15]I do my own makeup and my own hair.
[86:32.89]You look lovely.
[86:33.67]You're the loveliest woman I think I've ever seen in my life.
[86:36.40]Oh, really?
[86:37.25]Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry, but I'm taken.
[86:40.33]I'm taken.
[86:41.05]I've been married for 45 years.
[86:43.91]Yeah, that's excellent.
[86:45.70]Do you have a stool by chance for me to put my feet up?
[86:51.28]No, not yet.
[86:52.18]It's kind of an interesting scenario that I have here in this particular house.
[86:56.11]No stools.
[86:57.41]No, I mean, you could put feet up there if you want.
[86:59.11]It's too high, the blood flow.
[87:01.91]It's too high.
[87:03.83]How old are you?
[87:06.24]You shouldn't ask a lady that question.
[87:09.16]It's probably a bad idea.
[87:12.56]Ruined it.
[87:12.88]Do you have food?
[87:16.20]I do.
[87:16.52]I actually do have food.
[87:17.64]Do you have bread?
[87:18.80]I got lots of bread.
[87:21.01]Do you like bread?
[87:22.79]Not really, no.
[87:23.97]I don't like bread, but a house isn't really a home without food.
[87:29.55]I've got bread.
[87:30.71]I've got... I mean, I do live kind of like a 20-year-old that's in a dorm room, but I have peanut butter.
[87:35.85]I have cereal.
[87:36.39]I have mac and cheese.
[87:37.21]I've got bread.
[87:38.10]Oh, sweetheart.
[87:39.72]Why don't we whip something up really quick for you?
[87:41.60]Yeah, like maybe in a few days or something.
[87:43.10]No, no, no, no, right now.
[87:44.72]Why don't you do me a... Be a doll.
[87:46.98]I've got some stuff going on, but I'm not sure... No, no, be... Oh.
[87:50.64]I'm sorry.
[87:51.06]That might be me.
[87:52.18]Hold on.
[87:52.36]That's you.
[87:53.72]Yeah, don't worry about that.
[87:55.00]Hold on.
[87:56.14]I have a lot of nice people who call me.
[87:59.73]Okay, yeah.
[88:01.07]I can get some food ready if you want.
[88:02.15]I got peanut butter, you know, I got everything.
[88:06.34]Hello, this is Edna.
[88:09.34]Yes.
[88:12.08]My social security number.
[88:14.08]Okay.
[88:16.29]I can give that to you if you want.
[88:18.25]That's fine.
[88:19.66]What are you doing?
[88:22.28]Yeah, so my social security number is 4206.
[88:25.74]Is that a family member?
[88:27.16]My family wants to talk to you.
[88:29.18]Is that a family member?
[88:30.45]Oh, no, no.
[88:31.21]He's from the social security department.
[88:34.09]He's from the social security department?
[88:35.25]Yeah, yeah.
[88:36.75]Are you a family member?
[88:39.86]Did he hang up on you?
[88:41.08]They hung up.
[88:41.52]He'll call back.
[88:42.48]He's a real sweetheart.
[88:43.66]Was that like a son or a grandson?
[88:46.03]No, there's a little bit of a mix-up.
[88:48.45]I left my car on the south border of Texas, but it's a whole thing.
[88:53.47]Don't worry about it.
[88:54.57]I wouldn't give your social security number to people you don't know.
[88:58.50]Listen, will you be a sweetheart and get me some flour and sugar and eggs and some mayonnaise and maybe an avocado and a couple of, I don't know, do you have like a baking sheet or maybe a pie tin?
[89:09.96]I don't think I have any of those things.
[89:12.34]You don't have any of those things?
[89:13.45]I mean, you can take a look.
[89:16.09]Okay.
[89:16.59]Just to make yourself comfortable and maybe we could plan this maybe like in a few days, but not right now.
[89:20.41]Oh, no, I'm busy in a few days.
[89:22.73]No.
[89:25.75]Okay.
[89:27.31]There's not much here, but... What am I doing?
[89:30.71]Alright.
[89:33.64]What, he only eats macaroni?
[89:35.40]Is that you or me?
[89:39.98]I don't know.
[89:40.56]It sounds like you.
[89:41.42]I think it's me again.
[89:42.52]I need to make a phone call.
[89:44.70]Are you getting another call?
[89:45.67]How many calls do you get?
[89:46.57]It's me.
[89:46.81]It's me.
[89:47.31]Well, I'm a very busy woman now, right?
[89:50.95]I would change your phone number.
[89:52.55]Hello?
[89:54.63]Yes.
[89:55.98]I was telling you the social security number, right?
[89:58.92]Yeah.
[89:59.54]It's, uh, it's, um, I'm sorry, what was that?
[90:02.10]Yeah, I'd like to call for a, uh, a workout instructor.
[90:07.05]He's in prison.
[90:08.59]I want to get more physically fit.
[90:10.51]I'm quite busy right now.
[90:12.21]Some leg routines, something like that.
[90:14.07]He's in prison?
[90:15.23]Yeah.
[90:15.69]Whatever you cost, it doesn't matter.
[90:17.07]Because that's not me paying for it, except it is.
[90:19.03]How long has he been in prison for?
[90:21.57]Yeah.
[90:21.97]Do you have an address?
[90:23.79]What do you need from me?
[90:25.41]It's 985 Dollhouse Way.
[90:29.10]Is everything okay?
[90:31.46]Excellent.
[90:32.00]I'll see you soon.
[90:32.58]Okay.
[90:33.91]Well, how much money is it exactly?
[90:36.61]How much money would you need for me?
[90:38.91]Okay, so $10,000, and he gets out of prison.
[90:41.76]Scott, three years.
[90:42.96]Hang the phone up.
[90:43.76]Hang the phone up.
[90:44.32]Hold on.
[90:44.54]It's two seconds, two seconds.
[90:45.94]Okay, my wire details, if I could give those.
[90:49.06]It's a Wells Fargo or a Chase or whatever.
[90:51.59]Hello?
[90:51.97]Hello?
[90:56.74]I think so.
[91:01.22]Those look heavy.
[91:01.82]Come on in.
[91:02.20]Get in there and get physical.
[91:03.60]Come on in.
[91:04.20]Oh, thank you.
[91:04.60]I'm going to grab the door in the wind.
[91:06.69]Alright.
[91:07.29]OK.
[91:07.41]Yeah, I was looking about maybe some upper bodies.
[91:09.47]Upper body?
[91:10.15]Yes.
[91:10.53]Well, I can tell you how we're going to get you in shape.
[91:13.44]Excuse me.
[91:14.14]I'm so sorry.
[91:15.22]Somebody's on the phone over here.
[91:17.26]I'll have to call you back.
[91:18.92]There's a strange man in the house.
[91:20.58]Sometimes my workouts are the most effective.
[91:24.02]Yes, they are.
[91:24.58]Hold on a second.
[91:25.34]Don't take any more phone calls.
[91:26.66]OK.
[91:26.88]I'm just telling you.
[91:27.68]Well, you never know.
[91:28.91]Well, I would get your phone number, go to your store where you have your provider, and they talk to them about that.
[91:33.45]I think you probably shouldn't be answering those calls.
[91:35.45]I'll see you.
[91:35.95]What was your name?
[91:37.15]Gigi.
[91:37.87]This is Gigi.
[91:38.85]Oh, hi.
[91:39.19]Nice to meet you.
[91:40.37]Hi, I'm Edna.
[91:41.11]Nice to meet you.
[91:41.83]So what do we want to do?
[91:42.63]So what we're going to do, some light aerobic exercise.
[91:45.35]Get the heart rate elevated, okay?
[91:47.01]You can sit down.
[91:48.55]I think I'll sit down for this one.
[91:50.47]I want you to follow me.
[91:51.73]Sure.
[91:52.09]Okay, a couple of moves.
[91:53.53]First one, the sprinkler.
[91:58.00]Okay.
[91:59.30]Hey.
[92:02.89]Hey.
[92:03.47]That kind of hurts.
[92:05.27]That's more movement.
[92:06.13]More energy.
[92:06.81]Come on.
[92:07.31]But it hurts.
[92:08.05]Okay, we'll do a different one.
[92:09.03]I can do this at home.
[92:10.05]We're picking items at the supermarket.
[92:13.36]We're picking items.
[92:15.04]Come on, get that arm up.
[92:16.02]We're picking items at the supermarket.
[92:17.10]That's right.
[92:17.50]We're picking items at the supermarket.
[92:20.00]I got it.
[92:20.52]We're swimming in the pool.
[92:21.62]And we're swimming now.
[92:22.34]We're swimming in the pool.
[92:23.53]I can actually feel it in my pectacles.
[92:25.73]Are you feeling strong?
[92:26.71]Yeah, my pectacles.
[92:27.43]You look strong.
[92:28.17]Do you feel good?
[92:28.99]Don't do those.
[92:29.53]I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.
[92:31.13]More movement.
[92:31.71]I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.
[92:33.77]Okay.
[92:34.25]Just relax and just don't take any more phone calls.
[92:35.93]How do you feel?
[92:36.87]I feel, it feels, I'm lightening up a little bit, I think.
[92:39.00]And now it's time for the skyscraper.
[92:41.33]How much of these?
[92:41.93]How much weight are these?
[92:43.05]Those are five pounds each.
[92:44.23]Careful now.
[92:44.73]You don't want to hurt yourself.
[92:47.61]We're yummy mummies looking to be tight in the tummies, right?
[92:52.03]You got it.
[92:52.59]That's like 60.
[92:53.55]You might need a spar, but you're looking good.
[92:57.01]I wanted to drop those off as a welcoming gift for you.
[92:59.86]Thank you.
[93:00.20]I appreciate it.
[93:00.54]You look great.
[93:01.18]Thank you.
[93:01.68]It actually feels pretty good.
[93:03.26]You ever want to go out for like a 60 mile run?
[93:05.04]You just let me know, okay?
[93:06.02]Never.
[93:06.80]You'll never get that from uncle.
[93:07.80]Alright, I'll come back tomorrow morning.
[93:09.20]Excellent.
[93:09.58]So are you going to leave these here?
[93:10.64]Well, would you like them?
[93:12.30]I would love these.
[93:13.16]That would be fantastic.
[93:14.20]Okay, they're $200.
[93:17.51]How much was that?
[93:18.25]Do you need a credit card?
[93:19.51]No, that's okay.
[93:20.47]Okay.
[93:20.97]Listen, we're coming back for a workout tomorrow.
[93:23.75]Alright, get out of here.
[93:25.15]Get out of here.
[93:27.29]Okay, bye.
[93:28.87]That was a very strong workout.
[93:31.17]That was a very strong... Did that cost $200?
[93:35.39]So what was your name?
[93:37.99]What was your name again?
[93:38.81]My name is Sherba.
[93:40.59]Okay, and you have children or... I don't have kids.
[93:43.47]Why?
[93:45.75]Why don't you have children?
[93:47.08]It just didn't work out.
[93:48.00]I've just been trying to focus on my career.
[93:50.24]Okay, and what's that?
[93:51.20]You have a job?
[93:52.04]Yeah.
[93:52.60]Most of your kids don't have jobs these days.
[93:54.54]You go to work regularly.
[93:57.02]I don't get in a car to go to work, but I go in front of a screen.
[93:59.88]Alright.
[94:01.06]Very interesting.
[94:01.99]I'm sorry, what was that?
[94:03.43]I get in front of a screen.
[94:04.39]It's almost like a car.
[94:05.23]I have a mouse and keyboard, and I sit in front of a computer.
[94:07.49]What does that mean?
[94:08.75]That sounds like you made up a job.
[94:11.26]No, I get in front of a computer and I talk and I hang out with people and I chat with them and it's like, we chat and we're cool and we hang out and everything's cool.
[94:17.80]You don't have to make up a job to appease me, sweetheart.
[94:21.40]I still care about you.
[94:22.58]And I'm a plumber.
[94:24.26]Oh, the trees are a very beautiful job.
[94:27.20]That's very difficult.
[94:28.20]That's exactly what people need in today's world.
[94:31.92]It's plumbing, I go into the sinks.
[94:34.26]Well, I'll tell you what, I'd like you to really quickly, if you don't mind, could you point me to your bathroom?
[94:40.88]The bathroom's right into the store over here.
[94:42.28]Okay, I have a weak bladder, so just give me two.
[94:44.56]Well, so do I, but apparently they don't want to take care of it.
[94:46.98]Oh, that's not bad at your age.
[94:49.70]Alright.
[94:50.14]She was talking about getting flour.
[94:52.61]Yes, flour, a whole package of eggs, avocado.
[94:57.13]If you have anything like noodles, salami, anything like that, excuse me.
[95:10.68]Oh, my.
[95:13.73]Look, he's just like Jimmy Fallon.
[95:15.85]He just, like, breaks everything.
[95:16.87]Oh, it's doable.
[95:21.05]Okay.
[95:22.59]Okay.
[95:24.85]I need to get the flour ready.
[95:27.22]And... I need to... Okay.
[95:31.24]I need to get flour.
[95:33.58]And...
[95:39.99]Oh, okay.
[95:42.34]Easy does it.
[95:44.62]I'm a little teapot, shirt and stuff.
[95:46.90]Here is the handle.
[95:49.06]Edna, are you in there?
[95:50.18]What was that?
[95:51.76]Just too much?
[95:52.86]Would you like to dance, Edna?
[95:54.58]I don't know.
[95:54.98]It's a weird request, but would you like to dance?
[95:58.22]Okay, hold on.
[95:59.32]Hold on.
[95:59.85]Edna, come on.
[96:00.43]If you want to come on out here, if you'd like to dance.
[96:08.25]Would you like to dance?
[96:09.43]I would love to dance.
[96:10.43]Would you love to dance?
[96:11.47]Yes, yes.
[96:12.25]Okay, let's go ahead and do this.
[96:13.63]Okay, you leave, you leave.
[96:14.59]Okay, I don't know what that means.
[96:15.63]Okay, that means, alright.
[96:19.92]Oh, this is the mindful.
[96:21.02]Something in my throat was a little weird.
[96:22.90]You remind me of my husband when he was younger, before he passed away.
[96:30.16]Yeah, we turn, we turn.
[96:33.79]Yes, yes, just like that.
[96:35.29]And now you spin me around.
[96:37.01]Just like, thank you, thank you.
[96:39.87]We lock in our locket fingers.
[96:41.61]How long are we dancing for?
[96:44.42]Because I'm very tired.
[96:48.90]I don't know.
[96:51.08]Can you please let go of me?
[96:52.66]I'm trying.
[96:53.70]Please let go of me.
[96:54.66]I'm trying to let go.
[96:55.74]Can you?
[96:57.74]Okay.
[96:59.72]Into the kitchen, if you would.
[97:00.88]Into the kitchen.
[97:01.44]Alright.
[97:02.41]Go into the kitchen.
[97:08.09]Okay.
[97:10.95]Are you coming in here or?
[97:12.81]I'm coming in here.
[97:14.27]Listen, I'm a firm believer in a house isn't a home without cookies.
[97:19.10]Yeah.
[97:21.26]Can I give you my mother's famous recipe for cookies?
[97:23.90]Edna, did you wash your hands?
[97:25.54]I never wash my hands.
[97:26.94]You kids don't understand.
[97:27.98]I have a very good immune system.
[97:30.02]Very good.
[97:33.29]Okay.
[97:34.05]Is that alright?
[97:34.69]I mean... No, that's okay.
[97:36.09]If we're going to make food, then you should... Well, you'll do all the work, sweetie.
[97:40.07]It's all in the feeling.
[97:41.11]You have to feel this.
[97:42.29]So what do you need?
[97:43.25]Flour, sugar, eggs.
[97:45.25]What are we making?
[97:46.63]Cookies.
[97:48.49]Cookies?
[97:48.99]What kind of cookies?
[97:49.83]Sugar, eggs, water.
[97:52.27]Eggs are in there.
[97:54.49]What kind of eggs are these?
[97:56.19]Those are free-range eggs.
[97:58.89]What does free-range mean?
[98:02.10]I don't know.
[98:02.56]I just pretend to know.
[98:03.52]So I just pretend to know.
[98:04.60]I think that means the chicken's going to walk around.
[98:07.90]Okay, we'll need all of these.
[98:09.60]Is that alright?
[98:10.88]All of them?
[98:11.30]At least most of them, yeah.
[98:13.46]We could use a few of them.
[98:14.60]Okay.
[98:16.52]How much sugar do we put in?
[98:18.50]Honey, just embrace it.
[98:19.71]Sprinkle it all in there.
[98:21.39]This is to make cookie dough?
[98:22.83]Yes, go ahead.
[98:23.59]Just give it a couple good shakes.
[98:27.39]Put it all in there.
[98:28.11]All the flour?
[98:28.71]Well, I mean most of it.
[98:30.40]Okay.
[98:30.88]That's good.
[98:31.80]That's good?
[98:32.46]A little more.
[98:33.24]More?
[98:34.02]Yeah.
[98:34.54]Okay.
[98:35.37]Okay, a little bit more.
[98:36.39]More.
[98:37.57]Okay, eyeball it.
[98:38.41]Does that seem good?
[98:40.11]I've never made cookies in my entire life.
[98:41.27]You've never made cookies?
[98:42.75]Okay.
[98:43.95]That looks great.
[98:44.63]You want to wiggle it around a little, see if there's any lumps in there.
[98:47.40]You're fine.
[98:48.16]I don't see any.
[98:48.70]Okay, now dump all the sugar in it.
[98:50.36]People like sugar.
[98:51.60]I like sugar.
[98:52.26]It's good.
[98:52.76]Yep.
[98:55.51]And this is just how my mother used to make these.
[98:57.73]They're very simple.
[98:58.93]I'm sorry, I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[99:00.99]It's kind of hard to open.
[99:01.95]Oh, yeah.
[99:02.77]I don't know why you kids do things like that.
[99:05.18]It's just like... Where did you get these spoons, by the way?
[99:10.02]Those were left by my Uncle Ted, who recently passed away.
[99:15.59]Can I have them?
[99:16.55]I smell so bad.
[99:18.51]Can I have those spoons, or?
[99:20.25]Can you have them?
[99:21.25]Yeah, I mean, you don't use them, right?
[99:23.27]Obviously.
[99:24.11]Well, I mean, they were left from my Uncle Ted, who recently passed away, so I don't think that's appropriate.
[99:28.60]You need help with that, or you got it?
[99:30.14]I'm just going to open the top, because I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on, because somebody decided I was going to put Mickey Mouse gloves on and wear them the entire day.
[99:35.66]Well, you're your own person.
[99:37.10]You get to make your own choices.
[99:38.64]So how much sugar goes in here, Edna?
[99:40.34]The whole thing.
[99:41.44]The whole thing goes right in there.
[99:46.29]Yes, that's perfect, that's perfect.
[99:48.79]Okay, so that looks good?
[99:49.83]Okay.
[99:50.58]Yeah, now what I want you to do is I want you to crack two or three eggs into that pitcher.
[99:54.70]Okay.
[99:55.30]Okay.
[99:56.16]Two or three of them?
[99:56.84]Two or three.
[99:58.17]Whatever you're feeling today, do you want it to be extra moist cookies?
[100:01.21]Is there a recipe or are you just doing this?
[100:03.03]No, it's all in your heart, honey.
[100:04.95]But is it... I don't know what that means.
[100:07.95]How many eggs do you think would be best?
[100:10.57]If y'all was on a quiz show and you told me how many eggs, I would say probably like four.
[100:15.08]Okay, then put four eggs in and if it's terrible, we'll make it again.
[100:18.62]It's fine.
[100:23.54]Honey, oh, you gotta do better than that.
[100:30.43]We've made a good decision here.
[100:31.97]Well, these gloves are coming off.
[100:37.01]How about two?
[100:38.31]Yeah, you know what?
[100:39.01]I think it'll be great with, even one egg is perfect.
[100:42.33]You know, back in the war, when I was younger, we used to have to ration, and we could make one egg go a long way.
[100:47.62]Do you have mayonnaise?
[100:49.00]Or here, you know what?
[100:49.80]In the gift basket, I brought over some applesauce.
[100:53.14]Applesauce?
[100:53.94]This is applesauce.
[100:56.73]And then these are mint chocolates.
[100:59.45]Well, if you boil them up, it'll be a similar consistency.
[101:03.06]I mean, we'll roll with it.
[101:04.88]We'll roll with it.
[101:06.22]Okay, so boil these.
[101:08.04]No, forget it.
[101:08.68]Okay, take this.
[101:09.50]You don't put them in?
[101:10.50]Here.
[101:11.14]You're fine.
[101:11.81]You're fine.
[101:12.49]Okay.
[101:13.80]Well, I need a Ster.
[101:14.72]Do you have water?
[101:16.32]I do have water.
[101:16.99]It's right here.
[101:17.59]Take a little bit of water.
[101:18.99]I get a pitcher here.
[101:19.83]It's fine.
[101:20.89]So what is this going to make, Edna?
[101:23.21]They used to say two spoons of sugar would make the medicine go down.
[101:26.73]In this case, you have a whole box.
[101:29.31]So it'll taste very good.
[101:31.87]That smell you're smelling, by the way, is probably the eggs and the sugar combined.
[101:35.82]It's probably filling the room.
[101:37.00]I can't smell anything.
[101:38.12]Thank God.
[101:39.78]No.
[101:40.72]So how much water?
[101:41.28]Just a little bit of water?
[101:43.44]Like that?
[101:43.90]That'll do.
[101:44.60]Okay.
[101:45.74]That'll do.
[101:46.16]Do I mix this?
[101:46.73]Ster it up, yeah.
[101:47.91]And what are we eventually gonna, what kind of cookies?
[101:49.61]Really put your arms back into it.
[101:51.68]Uh-huh.
[101:53.14]Uh-huh.
[101:53.72]No, like really work.
[101:55.79]I want to see you actually working.
[101:57.49]Okay.
[101:58.27]It's good for you kids to work.
[102:00.05]Yeah, it is.
[102:00.99]You've got elbow grease, we used to call it.
[102:03.59]And this is sugar, flour, and egg.
[102:04.73]And this is going to make... Pecan sandies.
[102:07.53]Pecan sandies?
[102:08.45]My mother's recipe.
[102:09.72]Those are actually my least favorite cookie in the world.
[102:12.04]Why would you say that?
[102:13.10]Because when you bite into them, it tastes like you're taking a bite out of the beach on the ground, and it's like sandy, and it feels like gritty.
[102:18.22]So you don't want extra pecans?
[102:20.56]And when I take a bite out of a pecan sandy, I feel like there's sand in my underwear from the beach.
[102:24.47]You don't like that?
[102:25.23]I mean, I don't hate them.
[102:27.33]I thought that's why some people went to the beach.
[102:32.33]I've got it all wrong, I guess.
[102:35.53]Okay.
[102:38.13]Are you really tired after this?
[102:39.81]I mean, it's work, Edna.
[102:40.99]Look at this.
[102:41.41]Look at how much muscle I'm putting into this.
[102:43.00]You kids don't understand.
[102:44.94]Alright, that's good.
[102:46.02]Is that good?
[102:46.58]That's good.
[102:47.34]Can we see?
[102:47.82]Is that good?
[102:48.24]Yeah.
[102:48.54]Do you mind for two seconds?
[102:49.98]I have to make a quick phone call, if you don't mind.
[102:52.58]No, fine.
[102:52.98]That's fine.
[102:53.65]Put it in the oven.
[102:54.93]Okay.
[102:55.67]In the bowl.
[102:56.61]That's an oven-proof bowl.
[102:58.13]This is an oven?
[102:59.53]Okay.
[103:00.75]Yeah.
[103:01.17]Edna, this is plastic.
[103:02.35]Can I actually use your phone?
[103:05.10]And before you go in there, I need to take a shower real quick.
[103:08.01]Oh.
[103:08.85]Yeah, I mean, you can get on the phone.
[103:10.55]I'm going to call somebody this way.
[103:11.75]Okay, I'll make a quick call.
[103:12.67]I just need to take a quick shower.
[103:14.03]Just stay in here and don't... Alright, you're fine.
[103:17.41]Let me get these in the oven.
[103:20.59]So this is going to be pecan sandies?
[103:22.94]Yeah, put it in there for like 20 minutes.
[103:24.76]Okay, so 20 minutes.
[103:26.46]Oh, yeah.
[103:26.68]Doesn't that seem kind of long?
[103:27.42]Is it okay if the utensil's in there?
[103:28.62]Uh-huh.
[103:29.54]Okay, I'm going to take a shower.
[103:31.42]I'm so sorry.
[103:32.00]If you smell something, it's not me.
[103:43.98]My neighbor?
[103:45.60]What the fuck?
[103:47.90]She just won't leave.
[103:48.62]I don't have too much of a dick to make her leave.
[103:57.25]It's so much better.
[104:12.85]I think I'm just going to piss.
[104:15.35]I'm just pissing right now.
[104:17.81]Well, the water was off.
[104:18.91]The water's off now.
[104:19.79]I want to pee now.
[104:21.14]Turn the water back on.
[104:22.32]Turn the water back on.
[104:24.70]You don't just pee into an empty shower.
[104:30.42]You pee when your shower's running.
[104:32.66]Everyone does it, and you can pretend like you don't.
[104:36.10]I know you do.
[104:38.18]There we go.
[104:38.48]Let's move.
[104:45.03]I feel better.
[104:47.19]Sweetie, are you there?
[104:50.48]I would wash my hands, but... What was your name again?
[104:55.02]Justin?
[104:56.51]Justin, are you there?
[105:01.91]Justin, you don't by chance have nitroglycerin pills or anything, do you?
[105:07.67]I don't.
[105:08.07]What was it?
[105:09.15]No medicine.
[105:10.89]No medicine at all.
[105:11.80]I've got acetaminophen.
[105:12.86]I've got ibuprofen.
[105:13.98]Okay, it's fine.
[105:14.86]The cookies are probably done by now.
[105:16.60]The cookies are done?
[105:17.38]Oh, yeah.
[105:18.32]I already sprinkled the pecans in there.
[105:20.52]Oh, you put the pecans?
[105:21.56]Oh, thank you.
[105:22.06]I appreciate it.
[105:26.98]Oh, my.
[105:29.42]They smell heavenly.
[105:31.30]They do smell fantastic.
[105:32.64]That's strange.
[105:33.31]Just like my mother used to make them.
[105:35.35]Yeah.
[105:36.49]Well, open it up.
[105:38.29]Let's see.
[105:38.71]How does it look?
[105:39.81]The fruits of your labor.
[105:41.13]Yeah, I mean, it's the fruits of our labor.
[105:42.67]Might as well take a look and see.
[105:45.09]I'm curious.
[105:46.09]I think the plastic from the bowl must have transitioned into this.
[105:50.35]Yes.
[105:51.03]Is that the recipe?
[105:52.85]That happens.
[105:53.61]It's called osmosis.
[105:54.99]If you would have gone to school, you would have learned.
[105:57.54]Edna, could you get one for me?
[105:58.82]I have raw egg all over my hands that I don't want to get.
[106:03.06]Salmonella.
[106:05.20]You met my grandchildren.
[106:06.32]Salmonella.
[106:07.90]I've got a thing in my throat.
[106:09.18]My twin granddaughter, Salmonella.
[106:10.86]Did they come by?
[106:12.25]No, no, I'm talking about the food.
[106:14.37]They love these.
[106:15.17]I make them for them.
[106:16.39]They're very good.
[106:16.99]Can I try?
[106:17.77]Would you like one?
[106:21.39]I thought, okay.
[106:30.38]You can keep these, alright?
[106:38.00]Just like sand at the beach.
[106:40.42]I feel sand all up in my underwear.
[106:44.54]It's fantastic.
[106:45.51]It feels great.
[106:46.31]You look like you're loving it.
[106:47.63]You look like it.
[106:49.05]I was probably at the beach at some point.
[106:52.09]These are fantastic.
[106:53.31]I know, I know.
[106:54.11]Just like I told you, you just have to feel it.
[106:55.99]Anytime you want to make food, I swear, just put the stuff in there.
[106:59.20]Feel it out.
[107:01.22]Edna, it's been about seven or eight hours since you've showed up.
[107:04.98]I think it's time maybe, where do you live?
[107:06.80]Do you need help getting home?
[107:08.20]You know, I usually get lost, but someone will call me and I'll have to go down to the police department or the bank or something like that.
[107:15.13]It will be fine.
[107:16.07]Do you live in the neighborhood?
[107:16.87]I don't have a car.
[107:18.81]Yes, you don't have a car.
[107:20.29]No, but I could point you to where your house is.
[107:22.19]Okay, yeah, it's somewhere that way.
[107:25.43]Okay, well, maybe because it's getting late.
[107:27.64]I'm getting really tired, I'll be honest.
[107:29.02]I need the gift basket back, though.
[107:31.44]Could I have an apple?
[107:33.28]Sure.
[107:33.94]Let me just, just one apple.
[107:34.88]I mean, this is very, it's a very beautiful apple that you've given me.
[107:38.78]If there's anything you ever need, I know a lot of people, anything, especially if you have computer problems, you let me know, sweetheart.
[107:46.12]Okay, I wouldn't answer the phone for very many people anymore.
[107:50.16]Oh, I enjoy it.
[107:51.26]I have plenty of time.
[107:52.46]Okay.
[107:52.72]It was nice to meet you.
[107:54.68]It was a wonderful meeting.
[107:55.62]Bye.
[107:56.02]Maybe I'll see you again.
[107:56.82]It was fantastic.
[107:58.15]Oh, I'm sure.
[107:59.05]Thank you for the recipe and everything.
[108:01.35]Absolutely.
[108:02.05]Thank you.
[108:03.31]I'm exhausted.
[108:03.95]I hope she gets home okay.
[108:08.67]Is she going to get home okay?
[108:09.75]Should I make sure she's okay?
[108:12.36]She said she doesn't even know if she really lives.
[108:15.70]I have no idea.
[108:16.14]Should I make sure she's alright?
[108:19.88]I don't know.
[108:21.74]That was an interesting day.
[108:32.26]She was here all day.
[108:33.40]I'm just trying to be nice.
[108:34.58]I'm not trying to get rid of an old lady or something.
[108:36.90]You're here all day.
[108:40.12]I got the fitness instructor here.
[108:43.10]I feel like a little tighter.
[108:44.96]I also feel like...
[108:48.84]And we're doing this now, apparently.
[108:51.18]Oh, I'm going to do this into the bedroom, because I'm not fucking leaving another floor again.
[108:55.31]I just love to sleep in another floor.
[116:36.54]No.
[116:37.68]No thanks.
[117:04.78]What's today?
[117:07.58]Saturday?
[117:08.40]Thursday?
[117:09.34]Tuesday?
[117:09.68]I don't know.
[117:10.08]Do I have something to do today?
[117:13.04]No, I don't know.
[117:17.42]I think three or four people were going to call me.
[117:20.69]Like at a meeting.
[117:21.31]I don't know.
[117:23.19]Whatever happened yesterday, I just forget it.
[117:25.13]As of today, it sucks.
[117:26.59]Happens all the time.
[117:30.71]Somebody will bring me up to speed.
[117:33.67]Ugh.
[117:40.67]This is a cool bed.
[117:42.95]Not that cool.
[117:52.57]No, I don't want to.
[117:54.11]Not today.
[117:55.57]Something else.
[117:56.40]Something else.
[117:57.08]Not today.
[117:57.60]Ah, fuck.
[117:59.34]Whatever.
[118:06.65]Imagine not even being able to pee before you go to work.
[118:10.05]I'm coming, just wait.
[118:12.65]Oops.
[118:17.65]Look, pecan sandies.
[118:26.65]Alright, time to make the money.
[118:32.29]Wait, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[118:33.47]I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[118:35.79]Come on, why do you always pull so far down this, you're pulling my driveway.
[118:39.55]Why do I have to walk down the street to see you?
[119:16.04]Are you with them?
[119:18.70]You're falling very far behind.
[119:20.32]You know, I actually don't trust people that fucking work out that much.
[119:27.23]Seriously.
[119:27.59]Like, what do you have to prove?
[119:29.51]What do you have to prove?
[119:31.03]Like you can take a day off.
[119:32.55]You got like Monday, Wednesday, like Tuesday, Thursday, right?
[119:35.51]What do you have to prove?
[119:36.21]Why are you working out literally seven days a week?
[119:37.55]There's no reason to.
[119:39.57]Shit.
[119:42.23]Hey, how are you?
[119:43.18]Hi.
[119:43.54]Hi.
[119:44.26]It's really great to see you again.
[119:46.50]Yes, I'm one of those people that talks a lot of things about somebody and then when they see them, they pretend like they didn't say those things at all.
[119:52.72]How are you?
[119:54.30]Tomorrow morning.
[119:55.65]yes tomorrow morning 16 miles yes of course absolutely absolutely if you could do that away from my house um there's like six different intersections here you could go down I don't want to hear that in the morning or in the night really those people
[120:30.77]I feel like shit.
[120:32.73]Long day.
[120:36.23]Colon D, yeah, colon D, yeah, colon D. I'm hungry and I wanna shower and I'm not having a great time.
[120:41.75]Those people are having a great time outside.
[120:44.55]Why can't I have a good time too?
[120:47.79]I got like Ted shit here.
[120:53.03]Thank you.
[120:54.47]Some of you listen, some of you don't.
[120:57.28]That's okay.
[121:16.89]Ah, so much better.
[121:19.39]But you know what I mean, though?
[121:21.83]It's like you work out so much that you don't have time for anything else.
[121:23.95]It's like, I don't care how much you worked out.
[121:28.59]Look, I'm just trying to live.
[121:31.05]If I sit down, if we're at lunch, and you say, like, oh, hey, dude, by the way, I could do like 500 pounds five times for the rep.
[121:40.04]I don't care.
[121:41.94]That's good for you.
[121:42.70]You're saying that because I can't do that.
[121:44.78]You're saying that to me because I can't do it.
[121:49.57]God.
[121:50.49]You know what I can do?
[121:52.25]You know what I can do that they can't?
[121:55.65]Not much.
[121:57.51]Not very much at all, actually.
[121:58.65]Actually, it hurts to walk around for me at the moment.
[122:03.09]But you know what?
[122:03.62]One day I'll get there.
[122:06.02]That feels better.
[122:25.64]What is this?
[122:28.70]But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
[122:31.59]They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
[122:34.21]They shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.
[122:41.39]You know, I've actually seen this in somebody's bathroom before.
[122:45.59]I've seen that before.
[122:49.33]Whatever.
[122:49.73]I guess it's just... Here it is.
[122:57.99]showered, I feel clean, I feel good, although I'm kind of not having a great time, but you know, whatever.
[123:04.89]I got my expensive watch, that's all that matters, right?
[123:18.67]Let's go to the bathroom.
[123:27.14]Get this fucking stool out of the way.
[123:37.53]I don't know.
[123:38.57]I have to look at this every now and then.
[123:42.09]Something about that.
[123:43.25]By the way, what are you blurring?
[123:46.87]There's somebody sitting on that toilet that you're blurring.
[123:51.02]Who is that?
[123:51.98]That's not me.
[123:55.30]Oops!
[123:57.52]Wait, I'm done.
[123:58.06]Okay, we're good.
[124:00.66]Like there's somebody else sitting on that toilet.
[124:05.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[124:06.42]I'm going to the bedroom.
[124:17.41]You gave me this like mystery box of stools.
[124:21.23]I'm gonna place them.
[124:27.80]What time is it?
[124:31.04]It's pretty late.
[124:34.32]It's alright.
[124:34.72]We'll put two here.
[124:35.52]We'll put one over here.
[124:38.66]Not like it matters.
[124:40.74]I don't know.
[124:45.42]I'm getting kind of annoyed.
[124:49.66]What do I even need these stools for?
[124:51.02]I'm okay.
[124:52.38]Don't get too upset.
[124:53.16]Hey, this is how tall I want to be.
[124:59.37]All of you other five, seven men out there, you ever thought about this?
[125:03.85]You ever think about how big you were, if you were this big?
[125:08.58]This is what, six, six two?
[125:10.92]Man, God, what a figure that would be, wouldn't it?
[125:19.57]How about, I don't know, we can put him next to the bed.
[125:28.71]How about like one here, one here, and then should all three go over there?
[125:37.68]I don't hate that.
[125:39.04]I really don't.
[125:50.32]Three stools in front of the bed.
[125:52.03]I don't know if you get on the side.
[125:56.05]If you're as tired as I am right now, that seems like a pretty good idea.
[125:59.64]That means I can get out of bed, I can put my feet down on three different places.
[126:09.10]I am tired.
[126:15.13]How much cash do we have?
[126:16.67]How much money?
[126:19.47]What we got for cash?
[126:22.92]1960.
[126:24.12]Give me something nice, for God's sakes.
[126:31.94]I got money, so, no, that makes sense, because then I don't have to clean all this shit up.
[126:35.03]That's a good idea.
[126:38.83]Calling a maid is a good idea.
[126:41.01]Thank you.
[126:44.57]Because the last, I don't want to clean anything up.
[126:47.14]I want to be able to have somebody else do it.
[126:48.90]We got almost two grand.
[126:50.30]Let's use it.

[127:58.22]I'm assuming that you must be the maid?
[128:00.86]I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.
[128:06.79]Okay, you can stop.
[128:07.53]You have a big mess to clean, don't you?
[128:09.53]Stop doing the lap track.
[128:10.33]I don't want that.
[128:11.75]Yes, there's a mess in here.
[128:13.23]It's very messy.
[128:13.83]Well, trust me.
[128:14.51]I can take care of your big mess.
[128:17.42]Okay, come on in.
[128:18.20]Show me where it is.
[128:19.40]So pretty much what I want you to do.
[128:22.36]Come on in and watch the door behind you.
[128:23.40]Don't want to get hit by that.
[128:25.52]Such a gentleman.
[128:26.74]Yeah, I just don't want to do that.
[128:28.22]Wow.
[128:28.36]What a unique arrangement.
[128:30.56]Yeah, so there's this trash here.
[128:32.20]This is dusty.
[128:34.92]Yes, it is.
[128:35.36]It's very dusty.
[128:36.10]So if you want dust, there's some fruit here that needs to be cleaned up.
[128:40.00]Oh, saw stain.
[128:41.42]Yes, thank you.
[128:42.70]So there's, in the bathroom, the toilet needs to be cleaned.
[128:45.34]Okay.
[128:45.82]The trash needs to be taken out with this flower.
[128:47.50]The fridge needs to be cleaned.
[128:48.58]This room, the bathroom, any other rooms?
[128:51.00]Yes, come with me.
[128:51.68]I'll show you.
[128:52.16]Sure.
[128:52.60]Come with me.
[128:55.48]Bathroom definitely needs to be cleaned.
[128:57.30]The sinks need to be cleaned.
[128:58.42]If you have an opportunity to, it would be great.
[129:01.20]And how much do you charge?
[129:02.65]Well, for you, I'll drop my prices to $2,000.
[129:05.21]It's $2,000 for this?
[129:07.23]For the...
[129:10.38]With a sexy maid service.
[129:11.58]What's this $2,000?
[129:13.35]No, it's like $100.
[129:13.95]It's not $2,000.
[129:15.33]Well, lead me to the bedroom and I can show I'm worth $2,000.
[129:19.11]No.
[129:21.97]$2,000.
[129:22.07]What are you trying to say?
[129:25.69]Am I not sexy?
[129:27.59]I didn't say any of that.
[129:28.81]I'm looking for a maid service to come and help clean up, maybe make the bed.
[129:32.33]Okay.
[129:33.03]How sexy am I worth?
[129:35.64]I don't have $2,000.
[129:37.84]Okay, well, you're the one who called a sexy maid service.
[129:42.43]Well, honestly, I think you look great.
[129:45.91]I do.
[129:46.17]And I think you're probably the best-looking maid service maid I've ever seen in my life.
[129:53.34]Do you mean that?
[129:54.36]Yes, of course.
[129:55.12]Go on.
[129:56.72]I think you're the most attractive, sexiest maid ever.
[130:01.66]I do.
[130:02.22]I really do.
[130:02.92]Please keep going.
[130:03.90]You're so wonderful.
[130:05.48]You're so beautiful.
[130:08.03]Let me show you the bathroom.
[130:08.99]Okay.
[130:09.89]Come on into the bathroom.
[130:13.63]So I have a plunger.
[130:14.91]Uh-huh.
[130:15.85]I have a plunger, and if anything ever happens to the toilet, I'm sure you'll be coming and going over the course of the... Do you just want me to clean your house?
[130:24.44]Uh, yeah.
[130:27.22]Why didn't you just call a regular... I'm a sexy maid.
[130:30.56]That's, what do you mean sexy maid?
[130:33.95]Well, like a regular maid service is like a hundred, maybe two, but when you add the sexy, it's 2,000 for a maid.
[130:40.18]Well, what would you do for a hundred bucks?
[130:43.20]CLEAN YOUR HOUSE, I GUESS.
[130:44.68]THAT'S PERFECT.
[130:45.28]THAT WORKS FOR ME.
[130:45.94]200?
[130:46.66]OKAY.
[130:47.28]ARE YOU COMING HERE EVERY OTHER DAY?
[130:49.39]YEAH, I'LL COME.
[130:50.95]YOU STILL THINK I LOOK SEXY, THOUGH, RIGHT?
[130:52.81]I DO, I DO.
[130:53.47]200, IS THAT ALRIGHT WITH YOU?
[130:54.65]YEAH.
[130:54.85]YOU WANT TO GO LOWER?
[130:55.75]THAT'S OKAY.
[130:57.49]150.
[130:57.75]OKAY.
[130:58.23]FOR JUST CLEANING.
[130:59.31]BUT IF YOU'RE EVER INTERESTED IN EXPANDING MY RULES.
[131:03.36]YES, I WILL KEEP THAT VERY MUCH IN MIND.
[131:05.10]IF YOU CAN COME THIS WAY AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AND JUST START DOING YOUR THING.
[131:07.98]I'LL CLEAN OVER HERE.
[131:11.71]before I fucking shit my pants in front of the maid.
[131:16.31]Sexy maid.
[131:18.79]It's $2,000, but so much money.
[131:20.49]I'm just trying to get my fucking life together in here before I go back in there.
[131:34.43]And I'm fucking tired too.
[131:35.48]That's four.
[131:44.92]Wait, where is it going?
[131:54.14]Wait, what?
[131:56.77]Am I sick?
[131:58.89]Do I have the norovirus?
[132:01.17]What's happening?
[132:02.77]Sir?
[132:03.67]Yeah?
[132:04.41]Are you alright?
[132:05.49]I'm OK in here.
[132:06.31]You don't have to come in.
[132:07.35]Do you have a big mess you need cleaning?
[132:12.03]No, you can stay out there.
[132:13.79]OK.
[132:18.55]What did I eat?
[132:19.75]Those pecan sandies, I swear to God.
[132:27.94]Do you like food?
[132:30.92]Yeah.
[132:31.38]Do you like bread?
[132:32.50]Yeah.
[132:33.38]I wonder if they'll help.
[132:34.50]Yes, there's bread.
[132:35.74]I got multigrain bread over there.
[132:37.44]Wow.
[132:38.08]Do you like multigrain bread?
[132:39.13]Yeah, I like multigrain bread.
[132:41.15]Could I ask you why?
[132:45.06]Um, aesthetically, I thought it made sense to put it in the corner here to make sure there's enough room for people to come around.
[132:49.96]There's not enough space.
[132:50.94]Yeah.
[132:51.14]Maybe eventually there'll be a TV up here, like a big screen TV up here.
[132:54.20]Okay.
[132:54.90]Yeah, like they could watch the TV.
[132:56.22]Yeah.
[132:56.92]Play video games.
[132:57.58]Would have made sense to make it flush, but... Well, you're a maid.
[133:01.02]You're not an interior designer.
[133:02.18]You're right.
[133:02.64]I'm just a maid.
[133:09.71]That was the bread.
[133:11.13]That was the bread we have to eat.
[133:13.91]I'll clean the bathroom next.
[133:35.23]I can still eat it.
[133:38.36]Excuse me, sexy maid.
[133:41.00]What?
[133:42.28]Would you like a piece of bread?
[133:45.56]Sure, okay.
[133:50.20]Let's get some bread on the fucking stove top.
[133:54.39]Would you like a piece of bread?
[133:59.57]I've got bread and he threw it on the ground, but it's okay.
[134:01.39]Why don't you grab a piece of bread?
[134:04.11]I want you to eat.
[134:06.39]Well, I've been cleaning.
[134:07.29]I wouldn't dare touch it with my hands.
[134:09.45]Right, but just eat.
[134:11.35]Wash your hands and then eat.
[134:15.13]I'm not putting it in your mouth.
[134:16.36]Right, no, of course.
[134:19.78]Sorry, I'm just used to different clients is all.
[134:25.66]I'm getting out of here.
[134:27.70]I'm getting out of here.
[134:28.50]I'm getting out of here.
[134:30.64]I'm going to the bathroom.
[134:33.00]I'm going to the bathroom.
[134:38.24]I'm going to stay in here.
[134:39.28]And excuse me, this job is not done.
[134:48.37]That maid is scaring me.
[134:52.71]That job's not done.
[134:55.32]I'm so tired.
[134:59.71]Oh, my God.
[135:00.93]I think I'm gonna pass out.
[135:02.95]I think I really am gonna pass out.
[135:04.03]I need to go to bed.
[135:07.19]I have to go to bed so bad.
[135:12.27]I'm sorry if I smell a little weird.
[135:13.74]It's just been a long day.
[135:18.44]Well, that's $200.
[135:18.96]Are you gonna... What?
[135:24.38]200?
[135:24.50]I thought it was 150.
[135:25.98]I cleaned more than I thought I had to.
[135:29.33]There was a big mess in the bathroom.
[135:32.45]Okay.
[135:33.33]Take 200.
[135:33.69]Alright, sir.
[135:35.59]Well, I'll see you in a few days.
[135:37.73]Yeah, and it's 150 each time, right?
[135:40.67]From here on out.
[135:41.35]We'll talk about it.
[135:42.65]We're not doing anything else.
[135:43.83]Do you still want me to wear this next time I come?
[135:47.39]If you're comfortable wearing that, you can.
[135:49.97]You dog.
[135:59.16]It's been a weird day.
[136:01.48]I'm tired.
[136:02.90]Give me something to play with.
[136:03.88]Give me something to hang out with.
[136:05.00]I mean, you guys, seriously, like, I gotta go to bed.
[136:08.55]I can't just sleep on a couch every fucking day.
[136:10.93]Give me, like, give me, like, give me the bedroom.
[136:12.75]Get me to get me to bed.
[136:20.99]What is it?
[136:27.56]What does it say?
[136:33.92]You didn't wanna, what?
[136:35.46]Why not?
[136:44.54]Scammed.
[136:48.92]Literally all I can see is colors.
[136:51.36]It's the only thing I can see.
[136:52.37]I just see pink and I see like green.
[136:54.47]I see pink here.
[136:55.29]It's just pink.
[137:01.20]I need somebody who has to tell me to go to bed.
[137:03.34]If I don't, then you're just going to get me fucked up again.
[137:06.40]All I see is pink colors.
[137:09.96]That was really cool made.
[137:11.26]I really thought they were cool.
[137:12.32]I like to work out with people too.
[137:14.78]I'm going to get into the bedroom as fast as I can because I don't want to have a problem.
[137:19.56]For the first time fucking ever, for the first time ever, you made me go to sleep.
[137:23.51]Thank you.
[137:24.65]Seriously, this is the first time that you've ever done it.
[137:26.57]It took you long enough.
[146:49.49]Um, what is that?
[147:01.94]What is that?
[147:03.00]Why is there a computer in front of my fucking door?
[147:09.09]There's a computer here?
[147:10.77]What is outside?
[147:11.69]I hear something.
[147:16.55]A dog or something?
[147:21.09]Oh no.
[147:26.98]Oh my god.
[147:29.72]Oh my fucking god.
[147:31.24]I don't know what to do.
[147:34.70]What do I do in this scenario?
[147:36.06]Is it because of the food?
[147:36.78]Oh, it's trash.
[147:44.62]What time is it?
[147:45.52]It's fucking like, it's like one o'clock in the morning.
[147:51.64]Oh shit.
[147:57.04]Can you see me?
[147:57.97]I hope you can't see me.
[148:01.65]What am I supposed to do about this?
[148:03.27]I gotta go in the bedroom.
[148:07.49]Oh my god.
[148:10.26]Yay, computer.
[148:12.00]Cool.
[148:21.30]What?
[148:24.04]I don't know.
[148:25.00]I'm not going out there.
[148:26.10]What the fuck am I?
[148:33.71]Alright.
[148:34.09]It's time for you to pay.
[148:35.11]I don't want to go out here.
[148:38.79]Why would you make me do this?
[148:40.91]Hey, bear, you're in danger.
[148:46.16]Oh!
[148:47.34]Oh!
[148:48.27]Oh my God, he's biting me!
[148:50.37]Ow, my body!
[148:51.31]Oh, Jesus!
[148:52.95]Oh, play dead, play dead, play dead!
[148:55.41]Play dead, play dead!
[148:57.82]Ow!
[149:57.63]What are you doing?
[149:58.57]Oh!
[149:58.63]Do you see what he did out here?
[150:07.49]Why would you make me go confront him?
[150:11.58]Are you out of your mind?
[150:12.96]Are you out of your mind?
[150:14.02]What am I gonna do versus a bear that's five times as big as me?
[150:23.65]Oh!
[150:27.46]I didn't even sleep all the way through the night.
[150:31.76]Oh!
[150:35.72]What is this mess?
[150:36.80]Good thing I have a maid.
[150:37.81]At least they'll be able to help me clean this shit up.
[150:41.09]Close the door for the love of God.
[150:43.31]I don't want to fucking... Why are there bears here?
[150:45.59]Oh.
[150:48.03]Oh.
[150:50.79]Oh.
[150:50.89]Oh.
[150:51.87]Oh.
[151:00.91]Wait, I'm coming.
[151:01.59]Oh, I'm here.
[151:09.96]Wait.
[151:27.47]Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[151:31.58]Go fuck yourself.
[152:00.05]Good thing I got my watch.
[152:05.97]I feel so bad.
[152:08.33]Oh, there's a mess in my yard.
[152:12.29]There's a mess in my yard.
[152:14.61]There's a mess.
[152:17.57]There's a mess in my yard.
[152:19.11]I don't even... Wait a minute.
[152:31.42]That was okay.
[152:34.70]A little fun.
[152:40.56]Uh... I've got a bit of scrapes, I've got a bit of bruises, I need to go to the... I need to sleep a lot for a while, and then I need to go and get something to eat, and then I need to have something to do.
[152:56.97]Holy shit.
[153:01.22]I can't stream right now.
[153:03.62]There's no way I can stream.
[153:05.26]What, you want me to stream?
[153:07.70]Oh, no!
[153:08.64]No!
[153:10.39]No, I refuse!
[153:11.29]I can't!
[153:13.09]I can't!
[153:13.67]I can't!
[153:15.35]I can't!
[153:36.67]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[153:37.59]It's Jerma here.
[153:38.21]We're going to be playing some Call of Duty.
[153:41.61]So as you can see here, I'm going to be in the menu for a little while.
[153:45.02]And welcome to the stream.
[153:46.16]It's good to have you here.
[153:47.52]Of course, I have a pretty good day today.
[153:50.28]Had a crazy scenario happen.
[153:52.08]A crazy scenario.
[153:53.56]Yeah.
[153:54.30]Hold on.
[153:54.54]Let me get in here.
[153:56.40]What's that?
[153:57.59]Oh, no way, dude.
[153:58.23]Yeah, that's so funny.
[153:59.51]But, dude, I saw a bear outside today.
[154:02.22]Yeah, it was in the trash, and I, like, walked out there, and I was like, what the heck is that bear?
[154:06.78]And eventually, I went outside, and I did, like, a little horn, and the bear, like, got away from the horn.
[154:16.61]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[161:03.91]I got shit in my sleep.
[161:32.57]What does it say?
[161:33.13]Oh, the fucking, why hitting the water does that?
[161:40.70]You have been banned from Twitch for 24 hours.
[161:42.62]This is a temporary ban for sleeping on stream.
[161:46.62]Oh, what the fuck?
[161:52.38]What?
[161:53.40]When did I, when did I go to, I didn't go to sleep on stream.
[161:55.46]What are you talking about?
[162:00.94]Give me a fucking break.
[162:07.65]That's the first ban I've ever had.
[162:09.39]Are you sure I didn't get banned because I'm streaming from my toilet?
[162:16.52]Sleeping on stream, I think it's way less offensive than like shitting on the toilet and streaming.
[162:23.77]Just like that.
[162:26.26]That's six, by the way.
[162:36.82]I'd like to take a shower right now, please.
[162:51.57]It's the first ban I've ever had.
[162:54.99]God.
[162:56.75]I hope I didn't say anything weird in my sleep.
[162:58.35]I'm fucking starving and stuff.
[163:02.35]Oh, yikes.
[163:08.11]banned from Twitch.
[163:13.17]Can I call anybody?
[163:14.41]I don't know.
[163:18.61]I say all kinds of weird fucked up shit.
[163:20.04]Let me just brush my teeth real quick.
[163:22.90]There we go.
[163:23.42]Yeah.
[163:25.92]Brush your teeth in the shower.
[163:27.70]It saves about five minutes.
[163:29.10]That's a pro tip for everybody.
[163:31.28]Coming out.
[163:40.22]So what happened?
[163:41.80]What am I supposed to do?
[163:43.52]Like, there's an office chair next to the toilet.
[163:48.31]Um, why would there be an office chair here?
[163:52.53]In case somebody wanted to watch?
[163:53.97]Oh, hey, man, you got an extra seat?
[163:56.59]Yeah.
[163:57.07]Yeah, go ahead.
[163:57.49]You sit on your own.
[163:58.03]You sit in the toilet.
[163:58.73]I'll watch you.
[163:59.80]Why is there an office chair?
[164:02.80]I'm starving.
[164:10.13]Piece of bread on the ground.
[164:16.41]Good, I don't wanna go to work.
[164:22.18]I'm not going to work today, by the way, just in case you were curious.
[164:26.84]Not going to work.
[164:28.50]You can leave without me.
[164:30.41]I got plenty of money.
[164:32.71]Go on.
[164:33.91]Not going to work, go on without me.
[164:37.09]and tell the boss I said, I'm the biggest producer, so I can stay home.
[164:43.50]What is this?
[164:46.08]Does this work?
[164:57.49]Is this an organ?
[165:00.31]I don't think it works.
[165:24.47]A good idea.
[165:25.57]How about we play Radical Dreamers from Chrono Cross?
[166:02.50]That's fuckin' pretty good!
[166:06.10]And how about Super Mario?
[166:09.86]That sounds fuckin' terrible!
[166:14.21]Can I do, like, reverb?
[166:32.66]What?
[166:35.48]Oh!
[166:37.28]There we go, now we can argue.
[167:01.38]What do they want me to do?
[167:02.02]We're gonna make food.
[167:17.45]How about a piece of bread?
[167:19.51]Because it's the easiest thing to make.
[167:35.20]I like to toast it.
[167:35.86]I like to toast it real quick.
[167:44.72]Ah, better.
[167:47.72]I do have to pee though.
[167:50.42]Or, you know, the other one.
[167:56.50]I'm sad that the maid threw this on the ground though.
[168:02.86]I'm gonna play with the organ again.
[168:13.10]What do the pedals do?
[168:23.99]Holy shit.
[168:46.93]Oh.
[168:47.35]Hey.

[169:57.90]I didn't.
[169:58.74]Is that... The gloves are also a little confusing to me.
[170:02.52]Is that normal?
[170:03.84]Yeah, it's very normal.

[170:13.48]Sure.
[170:13.82]Yeah, sure.

[170:24.90]We should.
[170:26.42]I want to clean first.

[170:33.77]Yeah.
[170:38.28]by the way, dude, I had a rager.
[170:40.08]Excuse me, excuse me, Sheriff Tony Andrews, how you guys doing?
[170:43.08]Sheriff, how's it going?
[170:44.00]Listen, we're looking for a bear.
[170:45.81]Have you seen a bear around here?
[170:47.19]We're going around the whole neighborhood.
[170:49.09]I got animal control with me.
[170:50.75]How you doing?
[170:51.83]He's an expert at this stuff.
[170:53.05]Hey, there was a tornado came in and a bear came in too.
[170:56.22]Wait, there was a bear and a tornado?
[170:58.18]I kicked the shit out of the bear.
[171:00.50]There was a tornado?
[171:01.48]Smell him.
[171:02.24]I can smell him.
[171:02.84]There was a bear.
[171:04.18]There was a tornado too.
[171:04.94]Did you see the tornado?
[171:05.60]Okay, no tornado sightings in the area, but uh... I was just gonna say I didn't see a tornado either.
[171:10.50]Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's no tornadoes around here.
[171:13.84]You guys like organs?
[171:16.25]No, no.
[171:16.99]You seen a bear or not?
[171:18.55]I thought I had a bear encounter like yesterday.
[171:21.31]Okay, pick up your trash.
[171:22.21]You're like a full day late.
[171:23.97]Alright, pick up your trash.
[171:25.43]I don't know, he's a bear.
[171:26.35]He went like a... I don't... What the fuck was he saying?
[171:28.27]He's a fucking bear.
[171:30.19]You got a scent?
[171:31.53]I can smell him.
[171:32.25]I can smell him.
[171:32.93]He's probably here somewhere.
[171:34.37]I think he went this way.
[171:35.81]I don't know.
[171:36.21]Yeah, nothing tricks this.
[171:37.41]I can smell that bear.
[171:38.85]Why is everybody coming to my house?
[171:41.39]We'll find him.
[171:41.95]We'll find him.
[171:42.64]Listen, Sheriff Tony Andrews, if you need anything, give me a call and pick up the trash.
[171:47.34]Alright?
[171:47.88]I'm trying to.
[171:48.48]Let's keep the neighborhood nice.
[171:49.62]He beat a bear in a fight, right?
[171:52.58]Yes, I fought a bear in a fight, there was a tornado, and I got an organ.
[171:55.66]I knew I liked you.
[171:56.46]Okay.
[171:57.36]I knew it.
[171:58.20]I really liked you, but I didn't know you lived here.
[171:59.90]Well, hey, yeah, I just live here.
[172:00.93]I was just walking by.
[172:01.79]I don't mean to intrude or anything, you know.
[172:03.43]I just had a good time playing Battleship the other day.
[172:05.25]No, that was really fun.
[172:05.89]You still owe me a lot from that.
[172:07.65]I do.
[172:08.11]I was at quite a few things.
[172:09.53]When were they again?
[172:11.23]Yeah, I get to get in a shirt.
[172:12.33]I get to do a thing in a shirt t-shirt in front of a door.
[172:15.15]Milky Maids, 1500.
[172:16.41]Yeah.
[172:16.95]You know, if you ever wanted to play again, we could just sweep the debt.
[172:19.51]You know, maybe like double or nothing.
[172:22.03]Really?
[172:23.95]Do you have another job here, by the way?
[172:25.81]Oh, well.
[172:27.42]Do you work here in town?
[172:28.88]I'm a streamer.
[172:30.16]But do you work here, or is there anything else?
[172:32.58]Like in this town?
[172:33.32]Do you clean houses or anything?
[172:35.08]No.
[172:36.69]Alright.
[172:36.95]Come on.
[172:37.31]I don't know.
[172:38.03]Do you think my stream's not successful enough?
[172:39.89]No, no, no.
[172:40.27]I just feel like I've seen it.
[172:41.41]Don't you remember?
[172:41.79]I streamed like a month in a row.
[172:43.74]Yeah, I know.
[172:44.20]It was a long time.
[172:45.92]I know.
[172:46.96]It was crazy.
[172:49.30]You don't do anything else in this town?
[172:51.14]No, I just... Again, I just stream and... Alright, whatever.
[172:54.99]I won't even push it anymore.
[172:57.41]So you're talking about we could play what?
[172:59.99]We could play Battleship?
[173:00.81]Battleship, yeah, if you ever wanted to.
[173:02.13]Why do you have bread on the floor?
[173:05.11]I'm supposed to have it made.
[173:06.31]Seems like a bit of a waste.
[173:07.53]You just ate that off the ground.
[173:12.80]Should I follow you?
[173:13.46]Wait, come on.
[173:15.94]Come on in the other room.
[173:18.04]Wow.
[173:18.79]This is your stream setup.
[173:19.63]This is my setup, man.
[173:20.61]Check it out.
[173:20.95]That's convenient to have two chairs for like co-op.
[173:24.88]Yeah, it's, um... I could look up.
[173:26.44]This is good.
[173:26.74]You could watch me stream if you wanted to.
[173:28.48]Well, this is a good setup.
[173:29.60]Yeah, and if any... Like, by the way, it's cleaned very well from whoever that person happens to be that comes and cleans the house every so often.
[173:35.45]The maid?
[173:36.37]Yes.
[173:37.25]Is it a guy or a guy?
[173:38.51]I don't mean to assume.
[173:39.85]It's... Yeah, it's you.
[173:41.07]She's sexy?
[173:42.53]It would be you.
[173:44.59]I think it's you.
[173:45.31]Are we co-op streaming?
[173:46.49]If you want, do you want to co-stream?
[173:47.35]Yeah, sure, of course.
[173:48.21]Alright, how do you want to intro?
[173:50.24]Do you want me to do your intro?
[173:51.38]Yeah, like, sometimes I get nervous before a stream, so...
[173:56.77]Let's start the stream.
[173:58.23]You just go live.
[174:00.35]What's up, suckers?
[174:01.63]It's not live yet.
[174:02.57]Sorry.
[174:03.23]I'm a little nervous when I do co-ops in person.
[174:05.39]Yeah.
[174:07.43]It won't go through.
[174:07.99]Oh, I'm banned from Twitch.
[174:11.33]Why'd you get banned?
[174:13.95]Well, do you see where I stream from?
[174:17.41]Yeah.
[174:18.73]Yeah, this reminds me of another doctor streamer.
[174:20.94]But, you know.
[174:23.21]If you can make it work, you can make it work.
[174:25.07]Oh, shit.
[174:25.49]I'm going to fall out of the thing.
[174:28.33]Yeah.
[174:29.65]Right.
[174:30.21]This has been a bit eye-opening, man.
[174:32.17]I didn't know that you lived here.
[174:33.51]Yeah.
[174:34.59]I didn't know that you lived like this.
[174:36.97]Well, look, you've got to have your setup in a good place, right?
[174:40.17]No, that's what I agree with.
[174:41.73]Yeah.
[174:42.13]I think we disagree on how you accomplished that.
[174:46.43]I got a shower, too, if you feel like you need to take a shower or anything.
[174:49.35]I feel like that shouldn't be a thing you bring up that you have.
[174:52.41]It's like assumed.
[174:54.91]Yeah, but I mean, in case you needed to, it's there.
[174:57.65]Oh, homemade cookies.
[175:00.25]There are cookies.
[175:02.63]Oh, and what do you got here?
[175:03.67]You want to play?
[175:08.07]No.
[175:08.69]I got it.
[175:09.41]I've been waiting for your arrival for months, even though I didn't even know you lived here.
[175:14.08]I have Mickey, I can't, well, let's just say mouse, weird mouse cartoon gloves on.
[175:18.86]Yeah.
[175:19.76]And can you go ahead and open that for me?
[175:21.04]I'll open it for you.
[175:22.29]Let's get this moved out of the way.
[175:25.85]Sorry, I got to piss really bad.
[175:27.49]You take your time.
[175:28.29]I'll set it up.
[175:28.87]I don't have to go quite yet.
[175:29.89]Okay.
[175:31.15]Why would you bring it up to me?
[175:32.75]Just in case for you to know in the future that I'm going to have to go eventually.
[175:35.25]Thank you for the information.
[175:36.53]You're welcome.
[175:37.03]I also will have to pee in the future.
[175:38.53]There's a bathroom there, too.
[175:40.41]I don't know when.
[175:40.99]Should I set up your board for you?
[175:45.49]I think you should because I can't touch it.
[175:48.56]I made cookies with this woman.
[175:49.86]Do you know Edna?
[175:51.33]Oh, Edna.
[175:52.13]She lives down the street.
[175:52.81]Isn't she great?
[175:53.97]She's a little weird.
[175:54.63]She's a great chef.
[175:55.21]She's a cool chef, but she's a little weird, though.
[175:56.76]Well, like, weird in a good way, you know?
[175:58.72]Yeah.
[175:59.48]She's just friends.
[176:00.08]You know what?
[176:00.56]I got it for you.
[176:01.22]Yeah, I can't.
[176:02.22]I can't even touch that.
[176:03.66]Okay.
[176:04.44]I think this is how it goes.
[176:07.54]This looks much more complicated than I thought it was going to be.
[176:10.22]You know what?
[176:10.70]I was thinking, since you owe me about $500, we could just do a simple... You want to do two ships?
[176:17.59]Two ships.
[176:18.31]Maybe even just one.
[176:20.53]One ship, just the two-piece ship.
[176:23.14]I can't get this other glove off because it's taped to my wrist.
[176:25.03]You know what?
[176:28.31]It's a great watch, though.
[176:30.33]It is a really nice watch.
[176:32.17]Am I flexing enough?
[176:33.31]Do you know that I make pretty good money?
[176:34.67]Well, do you know that I make good money?
[176:36.69]I saw your last stream, you know.
[176:38.31]Yeah.
[176:39.93]Missed a day.
[176:41.65]Consistency is key.
[176:42.91]But, you know, you make great money.
[176:45.26]I don't want you to see my screen.
[176:46.36]Charming place.
[176:47.44]I'm not cheating.
[176:48.16]I can't get this.
[176:49.88]Just place one ship.
[176:51.10]We're doing one ship?
[176:52.06]Just one ship, yeah.
[176:53.14]Okay.
[176:54.16]You're not looking, right?
[176:55.12]I'm not looking.
[176:57.89]Alright, I got my shit placed.
[176:59.31]Do you have your shit placed?
[177:01.03]I do.
[177:01.61]Okay.
[177:02.89]Are you starting this off, or...?
[177:04.93]Yeah, I'm gonna say C5.
[177:07.25]That would just be so incorrect.
[177:10.18]So incorrect, it's a miss.
[177:13.36]Okay.
[177:14.14]This is $500 on the line.
[177:15.58]Wait, why?
[177:16.06]We're doing it for money?
[177:17.14]Yeah, you owe me money.
[177:18.06]This is a double or nothing.
[177:20.30]Okay, fine.
[177:21.02]Are you okay with that?
[177:21.56]No, I'm fine with that.
[177:22.18]You can make a lot.
[177:23.42]I didn't even know you lived here.
[177:25.30]Alright, so C5 is a miss.
[177:26.81]I will go with C5 as well.
[177:28.25]You're doing C5?
[177:32.43]That's a miss.
[177:33.41]I don't like the aesthetic here.
[177:35.18]Can you scoot to your left by like three or four inches here, like a little bit more?
[177:38.64]Yeah.
[177:39.04]There we go.
[177:39.48]I like that.
[177:39.96]I like the aesthetic there a little more.
[177:41.18]Is that a bit better?
[177:41.96]That's a bit better to me.
[177:44.24]Just something about the way you were sitting.
[177:45.44]It bothered you.
[177:46.63]It bothered me very much.
[177:47.95]That's fair.
[177:48.71]So you said C5?
[177:49.35]Yeah, C5.
[177:50.05]Okay, it's a miss.
[177:51.55]I'm going to say, you can literally see my voice.
[177:53.19]No, I can't see anything.
[177:53.99]You can see.
[177:56.31]I'm going to say F7.
[177:59.45]Incredibly incorrect.
[178:00.91]Okay, fine.
[178:02.71]Where are you going?
[178:04.88]Maybe, like, something in the first column.
[178:10.32]Okay.
[178:10.76]Well, you have to say something.
[178:11.98]Like, D, maybe C1.
[178:14.58]C1 is a hit.
[178:16.63]It's a hit.
[178:17.99]Yeah, and you literally looked.
[178:19.07]No, I wouldn't do that.
[178:20.91]I'd, like, move to your left, and he's like, oh, sure, I'll fucking look.
[178:24.95]You literally can see.
[178:26.17]I'm just going to take a random stab in the dark.
[178:27.73]D1.
[178:27.91]No.
[178:29.95]What?
[178:30.91]There's something on D1.
[178:32.51]Look, first of all, I want to do this real quick.
[178:35.85]Don't move.
[178:36.67]Okay.
[178:37.41]Here.
[178:38.04]I want everyone to see what I have.
[178:40.68]Show them what I have.
[178:41.38]If you ever have to go to the bathroom and take a shower, feel free to.
[178:44.28]I'll just hang out.
[178:44.68]That's where I am, and he looked, and it's bullshit.
[178:47.70]Never looked at anything in my life.
[178:50.08]Call me a cheater?
[178:51.06]Yes.
[178:52.34]So when did you move here?
[178:54.11]At 983, 983 Dollhouse Lane.
[178:57.27]983 Dollhouse Lane.
[178:57.85]I've been living at Dollhouse Lane for a while, actually.
[179:00.03]Yeah?
[179:00.47]Yeah.
[179:00.89]I was with my mother.
[179:02.51]I was friends with a man named Ted.
[179:03.95]Passed recently.
[179:06.93]Sad passing, too.
[179:08.95]Came out of nowhere.
[179:10.69]Blindsided us all.
[179:12.23]Yeah.
[179:12.77]You weren't there.
[179:14.43]No.
[179:14.63]By the way, at the funeral.
[179:15.69]It was weird.
[179:16.56]No, I wasn't, because I didn't think I had to be there.
[179:19.84]I just thought it was... Wasn't he your uncle or something?
[179:21.90]It was very clear.
[179:22.92]Well, he'd be your uncle, too, and we'd be literally like brothers.
[179:25.40]No, they're just friends.
[179:26.16]They're just friends.
[179:26.78]My mom's not related.
[179:27.42]No relation.
[179:27.80]You and I are not related at all?
[179:29.28]No, my mom's just friends with him.
[179:30.52]Oh, okay.
[179:30.88]So your brother was a friend.
[179:31.50]Okay.
[179:31.76]Yeah.
[179:32.46]I'm going to go F3.
[179:34.04]F3 is just going to be a miss on your end.
[179:37.42]That's fine.
[179:40.35]You don't have to pee yet or anything, right?
[179:42.51]I have had to pee for like the last hour, but I'm just going to hold it because I like talking to you.
[179:46.59]OK.
[179:47.03]OK.
[179:47.21]If you ever.
[179:49.15]Let me go with E1.
[179:51.89]E1 is incorrect.
[179:53.54]You already said that.
[179:54.06]You said that last time.
[179:54.92]No, I said D1.
[179:55.42]Oh, well, you were wrong twice.
[179:57.62]Where do you want to go instead?
[180:04.08]You know what?
[180:04.46]I'll go D2.
[180:05.52]D2?
[180:06.04]That is a miss.
[180:07.16]You already have a hit.
[180:10.49]Hold on, I gotta get this.
[180:11.57]Yeah, take it.
[180:13.25]Who is calling right now?
[180:18.74]Hello?
[180:21.10]It's just static.
[180:21.94]I don't know who this is.
[180:22.78]No, I don't know.
[180:25.34]Hello?
[180:31.00]Hello?
[180:35.57]What the fuck?
[180:38.48]It could have been a prank call.
[180:39.72]It could have been a prank call.
[180:40.74]That was a lot.
[180:41.70]Uh, you know what, I... Hold on, somebody's there!
[180:44.06]Was somebody there?
[180:46.27]A final courtesy call.
[180:47.89]Before we close out your file, I wanted to see if you were available to talk for a few minutes.
[180:54.26]If you'd like to speak to a specialist concerning extending or reinstating your vehicle's warranty, press 1 right now to speak to a warranty specialist.
[181:04.13]I'd like for you to put me on the do not call list.
[181:05.77]That's what I would appreciate.
[181:06.81]Thank you.
[181:07.55]Put me on the do not call list ever again.
[181:09.51]And I know what that means.
[181:10.33]That means you're going to put me in a database of people that answered the phone, so therefore I'm going to get 10 times more phone calls.
[181:16.12]The real play is for me to never actually answer the phone, because if I answer the phone, that means they have me in the database of people that answered the phone, so therefore I'll get more.
[181:23.97]Have a good day.
[181:24.77]Fuck you.
[181:26.92]What was your move?
[181:27.94]It was C4, like the explosive.
[181:33.12]That's a hit.
[181:33.80]What?
[181:34.26]Yeah.
[181:35.53]Oh, C3.
[181:37.23]That's a hit.
[181:40.19]C2.
[181:41.19]That's a hit.
[181:41.53]You won the game.
[181:42.17]Wow.
[181:44.05]I have to pay $500.
[181:45.05]That's $500.
[181:45.65]What?
[181:45.90]No.
[181:46.24]Alright.
[181:48.24]This is just for fun.
[181:49.72]No.
[181:49.98]That's just for fun.
[181:50.92]I mean, just some amount of money.
[181:52.00]That's literally just for fun.
[181:53.12]I guessed it correctly.
[181:54.68]You guessed it correctly, but you didn't even look.
[181:57.20]Hold on.
[182:00.01]Sorry.
[182:00.35]I've just really got to go to the bathroom.
[182:02.35]Yeah.
[182:02.55]Take your time.
[182:03.27]I've got to go to the bathroom.
[182:04.27]Take your time.
[182:05.37]Well, I can't go yet, but I have to go.
[182:09.32]I didn't think it would be like this when we hung out.
[182:12.29]I didn't even know you lived- I thought you lived somewhere- I didn't know you lived here!
[182:14.77]I've always lived in Dollhouse.
[182:16.27]You, like, walked over on the- I was doing my thing, playing the organ, and I didn't know you were here.
[182:20.72]Who are those fucking weirdos, by the way?
[182:22.76]Is it police?
[182:23.22]It's the police!
[182:24.34]There's been a bear on the loose.
[182:26.36]Have you had a bear in your house?
[182:27.44]Well, before, yeah.
[182:28.58]You've had a bear come to your front door?
[182:29.84]Uh, before, yeah.
[182:30.88]What'd you do?
[182:31.52]Well, the rational thing, I called the cops.
[182:32.88]What else would you do?
[182:34.48]That's exactly- That's what I fucking- Let's see what I was saying.
[182:37.22]What would you do?
[182:38.08]I would call the police.
[182:39.69]But I fought him, and I kicked his ass.
[182:42.23]What?
[182:42.59]And then he kicked my ass.
[182:43.75]You fought the bear?
[182:44.75]Yeah, I kicked his ass.
[182:45.83]Why would you fight a bear?
[182:46.85]And then he kicked my ass.
[182:48.13]I can't believe this.
[182:49.39]Yeah, I kicked his ass.
[182:50.29]Okay.
[182:51.41]You're saying it with a tone that makes me think you might not have.
[182:54.95]I'll be right back.
[182:56.23]Take your time.
[182:57.05]Just hang out.
[182:57.51]There's food in the fridge.
[182:58.33]There's, like, pecan sandwiches I made.
[183:04.74]He's so bad.
[183:15.11]Ludwig is in my house right now.
[183:17.25]Like, he's fucking, he's awesome.
[183:19.09]He's, like, a huge screamer.
[183:20.05]He's, like, fucking really funny and shit.
[183:22.83]I wasn't, like, prepared for this.
[183:25.19]Wow.
[183:28.23]I got to pee so fucking bad, you have no idea.
[183:36.44]Please, help me.
[183:37.28]Please.
[183:39.62]Please.
[183:42.57]I'll do anything.
[183:43.23]I really will.
[183:43.79]I'll do anything.
[183:44.23]Just please let me go to the bathroom.
[183:51.16]Hey!
[183:52.30]Hey!
[183:52.54]Hey!
[183:52.94]Hey!
[183:54.00]Hey!
[183:54.28]How are you?
[183:55.10]I'm doing good.
[183:57.06]Yay!
[183:57.34]Cool.
[183:58.46]He's doing good.
[183:59.28]Yeah.
[183:59.60]Awesome.
[184:00.40]Yeah.
[184:00.94]How are you doing?
[184:01.62]I'm doing dust.
[184:02.44]It's good to have you here, man.
[184:03.30]Yeah.
[184:04.53]It's really good to have you here.
[184:06.49]You seem on edge.
[184:08.97]Yeah.
[184:09.73]You want something to drink?
[184:10.73]No, I'm fine.
[184:24.42]I got a stereo in here.
[184:25.53]I'm listening to weird music.
[184:33.40]No, I get that.
[184:44.71]I listen to drum solos.
[184:46.59]It kind of feels like you're trying to drum over the sound of your shitting, but that makes sense too.
[184:51.09]It's drum solos.
[184:52.51]Why is the paper this far away?
[184:56.57]Why would the paper be over here?
[184:58.75]This guy's a bit of a psycho.
[185:04.66]Thank God.
[185:05.52]Okay.
[185:09.84]That paper is like three feet away.
[185:14.07]Oh yeah.
[185:14.79]Let me do that.
[185:23.93]Hands washed.
[185:30.64]Hey!
[185:31.58]Ludwig, how are you?
[185:33.02]Hey.
[185:33.64]How you doing?
[185:34.56]You've done this a couple times.
[185:35.78]Yeah.
[185:36.22]Whoops.
[185:37.10]Doing good.
[185:37.86]Good, good, good.
[185:39.23]Doing good.
[185:40.19]Hey, I don't want to stay too long.
[185:41.53]It seems like you got a lot of shit going on.
[185:43.39]No.
[185:44.39]I mean, not really.
[185:45.33]Yeah.
[185:46.03]Okay.
[185:46.19]Just a few things.
[185:47.09]Yeah.
[185:47.35]But I'm really happy you came over.
[185:48.55]I hope you like the place.
[185:49.54]I mean, it's...
[185:52.62]That's cool.
[185:53.34]It's alright.
[185:53.92]Oh, yeah.
[185:55.12]It's a low mortgage.
[185:56.38]I got it on a good deal.
[185:58.18]Right.
[185:59.43]Yeah.
[186:00.33]Yeah.
[186:00.55]You got a beer?
[186:01.67]Oh, I... Yeah.
[186:02.79]Is that okay?
[186:03.35]No, that's cool, man.
[186:04.01]I'm just going to help myself.
[186:05.91]Yeah, it's cool, man.
[186:08.17]Just, um... But, you know, I don't want to... Yeah, I don't know.
[186:11.97]It's just all good, man.
[186:13.09]What are you... Yeah.
[186:14.41]Sometimes I just got to, like, fucking get some blood pumping.
[186:16.31]Yeah.
[186:16.99]Sorry.
[186:17.41]I, um...
[186:20.13]Do I do it with you?
[186:21.16]You can if you want to.
[186:22.24]Sometimes I just feel like doing it because I feel like I've got to get some blood going in my body.
[186:26.88]Maybe you could move this to not be in the middle.
[186:29.02]That would be workout.
[186:31.28]Well, I mean, I can't get swole that way.
[186:33.72]Right.
[186:34.54]That makes a lot of sense.
[186:35.56]It does.
[186:37.34]Well, hey, it's been a pleasure.
[186:38.60]Thanks for the money.
[186:39.62]It's been wonderful.
[186:41.32]Yeah?
[186:41.94]Yeah, how many times do I have to pay you every time I see you?
[186:43.82]Don't want to be too forward.
[186:44.80]Maybe worth getting a maid around these parts.
[186:47.01]Yeah, I know.
[186:48.29]I thought about that.
[186:48.99]Yeah.
[186:50.13]Weirdly enough, though, weird, weird, really weird.
[186:52.39]Maids are like two grand around here.
[186:53.97]It's full of sexy ones, but you're not a perv.
[186:56.01]You wouldn't get those ones.
[186:57.13]No.
[186:57.47]Those are the maids that are like, happy ending maids.
[187:00.31]Two grand though, it's a little high.
[187:01.52]Well, it's a good ending.
[187:03.08]It's a little high.
[187:03.62]Okay?

[207:58.25]Officer, I don't want a criminal just in my house.
[208:01.15]He hasn't actually officially been arrested yet.
[208:03.41]There's a whole other story.
[208:04.67]Dude, this is boring.
[208:06.59]Hold my phone.
[208:08.29]Dude, this is crazy, man.
[208:10.35]Let me just double check something, okay?
[208:12.47]You can look if you want.
[208:13.55]I don't think there's anything wrong.
[208:15.23]I mean, the TV doesn't work.
[208:16.25]It broke.
[208:19.16]Yeah, that's the exact serial number with the GPS.
[208:21.84]I didn't buy it.
[208:22.72]Somebody bought it for me.
[208:23.90]It came in here, sleep aroused, demons bring it to me, and it's going to take my name on my bank account.
[208:27.60]Yeah, do me a favor.
[208:28.52]Oh, yeah, of course.
[208:28.92]I'm going to need you to help me pick this up, alright?
[208:30.76]Oh, yeah, sure.
[208:31.40]I'm sorry, sir, this is stolen property.
[208:33.34]No, no, no.
[208:34.14]Unless you want me to... You can't take my TV.
[208:35.74]You want me to arrest you?
[208:37.92]It's your choice, you know.
[208:39.24]You can't take this TV.
[208:40.42]Okay, listen, you want him to take the TV, because I'm taking this.
[208:42.65]I don't want anyone to take my TV.
[208:43.87]This is my TV.
[208:44.67]It was brought to me by the sleep paralysis demons, and they came to me in the nighttime, and they dropped shit, and they, like, touched my head sometimes.
[208:51.41]They touched your head sometimes.
[208:53.89]By the way, can I just tell you?
[208:56.40]You are probably, I would say, probably the most handsome police officer I've ever seen.
[209:00.50]You're like another dude here, right?
[209:02.84]Like, I'm a person, dude.
[209:04.44]I'm sorry, I just picked up the outfit, the uniform.
[209:08.59]I really appreciate that.
[209:09.73]My mother always told me I look good in blue.
[209:12.11]You do look fantastic.
[209:15.19]Thank you.
[209:16.11]I mean, listen, maybe we should grab a beer sometime or something.
[209:19.91]I would love that.
[209:20.79]I would absolutely love going out for a beer.
[209:22.64]Where'd you put my phone?
[209:23.74]It's in my hands, bro.
[209:25.00]You made me hold it for you, dude.
[209:27.00]Listen, here's the thing.
[209:28.34]I can either fine you for $300.
[209:30.38]Don't fine me.
[209:32.25]Okay, and I can say that maybe I didn't see the TV.
[209:35.57]I don't know.
[209:36.19]But listen, man, I'm going to take the TV either way.
[209:40.61]Well, guess what, officer?
[209:42.20]The TV...
[209:44.19]It doesn't fucking work.
[209:46.07]It doesn't work.
[209:46.83]So you broke it.
[209:47.95]I didn't break it.
[209:48.89]I fucked it in.
[209:50.49]You stole a TV and you broke it.
[209:52.06]I just wanted to watch a sports program on it and it didn't work.
[209:54.66]It doesn't look... It looks like it works a little bit, dude.
[209:57.88]It's just like kind of abstract, man.
[210:00.04]It's the paralysis demons.
[210:01.02]You want me to hang this on the wall and make it an abstract art painting?
[210:04.20]I'm sorry, you're going to have to keep your hands off the contraband, alright?
[210:07.10]Alright, alright, alright.
[210:08.24]Listen, I'm going to have to confiscate it.
[210:10.11]Go ahead and take it.
[210:10.81]I'm taking it.
[210:11.91]We're taking it.
[210:13.53]You go ahead and lift that up for me.
[210:14.85]You expect me to pick up the freaking TV?
[210:17.39]It's part of your community service.
[210:19.73]Really?
[210:22.34]Good luck.

[210:24.58]Thank you.
[210:24.86]Appreciate it.
[210:25.82]By the way, like I've got to say before, I've said it before again.
[210:28.90]Probably the most handsome cop I've ever seen in my life.
[210:30.90]Can we not address the fact that I'm, like, walking backwards?
[210:33.71]Can you pick up the pace a little bit, please?
[210:35.05]Dude, I'm literally going, like, as fast as I can here.
[210:37.45]Watch out for the couch.

[218:10.19]Do you want to see how dirty these are over the last three or four hours?
[218:20.06]Look at this.

[219:10.23]Can we?
[219:12.09]I'm trying so hard to not have my arms go up, because I don't want anyone to see my armpit hairs.
[219:15.79]Because that, like, somebody's gonna screenshot it and, like, keep it.
[219:18.98]I don't want you to have that.
[219:22.40]I'm going to the bedroom.
[219:35.08]All I have in my third room is like stools and a bed.
[219:42.37]I mean, the organ's out there and that's pretty cool.
[219:44.65]I'm gonna go back and play that.
[219:47.73]But like,

[219:52.66]I'll take a second bathroom.
[219:55.52]I don't think that's even possible.
[220:01.51]Thank God.
[220:10.27]This bed smells like Cheez-Its.
[220:14.47]I didn't eat Cheez-Its in here.
[221:11.80]Okay, alright.
[221:13.46]Alright, I need two shadows in here.
[221:15.82]Oh yeah, that's a bad dream for Joyma.
[221:20.27]Hey boys, yeah, get him up, get him up.
[221:22.67]He's having a bad dream, ain't that right, big boy?
[221:26.13]Whoa.
[221:28.63]All alone, all alone in your house.
[221:31.76]What, do you miss that maid?
[221:32.80]You miss that cute maid from the other day?
[221:34.68]Yeah, get him up.
[221:37.44]Get him up.
[221:39.47]Oh, what's that?
[221:40.33]When's the last time you showered, big boy?
[221:42.51]Oh, yeah.
[221:47.93]Okay, come on.
[221:48.83]Yeah, that's it.
[221:49.69]Get him up.
[221:50.23]Get him in the bathroom.
[221:52.43]Oh, I can smell him from here.
[221:55.55]Come on, both of you.
[221:57.23]I'm not going to get my hands dirty.
[221:58.69]There we go.
[221:59.29]Come on.
[222:00.29]Yeah.
[222:02.29]Big boy Jerma.
[222:05.27]Oh, what's this?
[222:06.65]Your game station?
[222:08.59]Oh, take a look at that.
[222:12.13]I can smell it from here.
[222:14.47]What's that, dude?
[222:15.45]You gotta go to the bathroom, big guy.
[222:18.57]Looks to me like you gotta go to the bathroom.
[222:20.73]Someone's not been taking care of their needs, boss.
[222:24.06]Get him on the toilet.
[222:26.50]Yeah, that's it.
[222:28.28]Yeah.
[222:30.27]Then Jerma poops himself.
[222:32.23]This is Kensington's class.
[222:33.61]He poops himself in front of everybody.
[222:35.57]No, no, I didn't poop my pants in front of everybody.
[222:37.57]And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.
[222:39.64]I didn't.
[222:40.12]Poop yourself.
[222:42.80]That'd be embarrassing to poop yourself in front of so many people.
[222:46.28]This is Kensington's class.
[222:47.72]And the cowboy's got a sword.
[222:49.34]Yeah, you pooped yourself.
[222:52.04]You better keep pooping yourself there, boy.
[222:54.36]And then he starts screaming.
[222:57.43]Oh!
[222:58.15]Oh!
[222:58.41]Hey, everybody, it's me, Jerma NFL!
[223:00.53]You live pooping yourself?
[223:02.05]No!
[223:02.67]Yeah, you are.
[223:04.62]Yeah, you are.
[223:06.82]You're pooping yourself on television.
[223:09.38]Oh, yeah.
[223:10.36]I bet you like that big boy.
[223:14.76]I'm about to go live.
[223:15.72]That's a TOS violation.
[223:17.00]He's hungry.
[223:17.94]That's a TOS violation.
[223:19.26]I'm about to go live.
[223:20.10]And he gets up again.
[223:21.56]I hear your stomach growling.
[223:23.02]Get up.
[223:23.53]Mrs. Kensington, it's for a great cause.
[223:25.39]They get him up, and then we go to the kitchen, and he doesn't wash his hands either.
[223:30.47]Oh, disgusting.
[223:31.31]I wash my hands every time.
[223:32.97]Yeah, sure you do, pal.
[223:34.65]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[223:37.61]Oh, yeah.
[223:41.79]No!
[223:42.45]No, I didn't shit myself!
[223:50.65]No!
[223:51.81]I'm a good boy!
[223:55.03]Make the sandwich with you.
[223:56.45]It's your treat, big guy.
[223:58.98]You made the sandwich.
[224:00.30]Oh, no.
[224:00.70]Make the sandwich with this one friend.
[224:04.34]You don't have where we're from.
[224:06.12]It's dangerous.
[224:24.15]Ah!
[224:24.74]Ah!
[224:27.89]Ah!
[225:19.26]What the fuck?
[225:27.70]Huh?
[225:30.90]What am I doing in here?
[225:34.76]Oh my God.
[225:36.15]You know when you ever have a dream, you ever have a dream where you, and you, you ever have it, then you have it, you ever, you ever have it, when you have it, you ever have it, when did you have a dream, you have it, when you have it, and you had it?
[225:53.53]I feel awful.
[225:58.38]Why is this stuff all over here?
[226:00.66]I had this dream.
[226:01.48]I had this fourth grade teacher.
[226:05.72]And I pooped my pants in the class, but whatever.
[226:08.87]You guys don't know that.
[226:09.65]You don't need to know that.
[226:10.51]Nobody needs to know that here.
[226:13.27]But pretty much the end of the story is I had a bad dream about how people laughed at me, thought I was stupid, and whatever.
[226:25.56]What a fucking joke.
[226:27.32]Why is all my stuff everywhere?
[226:29.84]Why is my stuff everywhere?
[226:31.22]And why am I holding two pieces of bread?
[226:35.92]Ay-yi-yi.
[226:44.80]Ugh.
[226:46.56]That was very weird.
[226:49.80]That was very weird.
[226:52.58]That was... That was...
[227:05.53]I wanna go play the organ.
[227:06.75]At least I'll have some fun.
[227:08.41]Do I have any mail?
[227:17.96]I gotta get rid of this.
[227:19.14]I hope you didn't see that on camera.
[227:24.88]What's in the mail?
[227:25.54]It's rain.
[227:36.94]What's in the mail?
[227:44.50]There's nothing in the mailbox.
[227:49.42]I don't see anything in this mailbox.
[227:51.51]There's nothing in the mailbox.
[227:56.65]There was no mail.
[228:03.83]I'm doing this.
[228:18.36]Play public domain music?
[228:20.14]Is that what they said?
[228:21.86]Um, okay.
[228:58.89]Maybe take a shower now.
[229:04.17]That's fucking water.
[229:27.32]Real shower.
[229:32.43]Good thing I have my tetanus shot.
[229:54.03]There we go.
[229:56.27]Nice and clean.
[229:58.89]Ready to take on the day.
[230:04.38]Is it raining in just a centralized location?
[230:11.78]No.
[230:14.76]Jerma's house.
[230:20.29]Very, very good.
[230:24.49]Very, very good.
[230:29.67]Got to get those bars green.
[230:32.35]Very green.
[230:34.23]Lime green.
[230:37.03]Citrus green.
[230:41.81]Pistachio green.
[230:46.77]What else is green?
[230:49.61]Toad green.
[230:50.42]Frog green.
[230:53.70]Green green.
[230:55.24]Grass green.
[231:01.51]I'll take a long one today.
[231:02.45]I'm letting it hit me directly in the chest.
[231:13.35]I like turning the water up like kind of high and then it's like it just it just hits me directly in the chest and it feels so good.
[231:22.10]I come up with like a red burnt chest but I love it.
[231:26.72]What the?
[231:27.02]Hello?
[231:27.34]Hello?
[231:29.33]Hello?
[231:30.47]Wait, Mr. Jerma!
[231:31.55]Hey, hey, what are you doing here?
[231:32.69]What are you doing?
[231:33.84]Ludwig?
[231:34.26]Yeah, no, I'm your maid.
[231:39.90]You didn't even ask my name once.
[231:41.31]Who is it?
[231:42.37]Who is it?
[231:43.23]Oh, it's the maid.
[231:44.57]Oh, it's the maid.
[231:45.89]What are you just calling out, maid?
[231:47.73]Is this your fiancé?
[231:49.15]I'm in the shower, please.
[231:50.41]I'm in the shower.
[231:51.29]Please, I'm so embarrassed.
[231:52.51]I'm in the shower.
[231:53.53]Alright, I'll go to your bedroom then.
[231:54.83]I'll go to your bedroom.
[231:55.57]What the hell are you doing?
[231:56.37]You said come back every few days.
[231:58.18]I did, but I... It's been a few days.
[232:00.62]Okay, alright, just do what you think.
[232:08.27]The name's Amelia.
[232:09.41]It's Amelia.
[232:10.05]Amelia.
[232:10.75]Okay, Amelia, thank you.
[232:12.15]I appreciate it, but I need to come out of the shower now.
[232:15.21]I need to come out of the shower now.
[232:18.45]Who needs this many stools?
[232:25.39]Alright.
[232:25.63]Is it to get in bed for him?
[232:27.07]I need to move this.
[232:31.87]What was that?
[232:33.31]Perhaps steps.
[232:37.44]OK, that looks good.
[232:39.42]That makes sense.
[232:41.28]I've got to move this stuff out of my way.
[232:42.71]Amelia will take care of that.
[232:43.73]I don't have to worry about that.
[232:47.89]Sir, can I do the bathroom?
[232:51.19]I'm not in the bathroom anymore.
[232:59.03]I'm no longer in the bathroom.
[233:00.83]Perfect.
[233:01.91]I'll just stay out of your way.
[233:03.45]Good.
[233:14.14]Um, you dropped this.
[233:16.16]Oh, thank you so much.
[233:17.44]Yes.
[233:18.02]You looking for an outlet?
[233:19.30]Oh, yeah.
[233:20.06]I think there's... I have no idea where one is.
[233:23.19]That's... I think there's one outlet in the whole house.
[233:26.03]There's one right here, sir.
[233:26.81]Thank you.
[233:27.31]You got it?
[233:27.69]Yeah, I got it.
[233:28.31]I got it.
[233:37.23]That's a beautiful vacuum cleaner.
[233:38.77]A lot of bathroom usage for you today, sir.
[233:41.15]Almost as beautiful as you.
[233:42.73]What?
[233:43.69]That vacuum is almost as beautiful as you are.
[233:47.17]I mean it.
[233:50.96]What is that?
[233:51.78]It's the sweetest thing I've heard all week.
[233:53.18]Thank you.
[233:55.02]Can I get a hug?
[233:56.28]Yes, sure.
[233:59.62]Absolutely.
[234:00.06]Come here.
[234:02.92]Thank you.
[234:03.34]There you are.
[234:05.38]You need to go to the bathroom.
[234:06.06]It's right here.
[234:07.99]Thank you for telling me that.
[234:09.95]Yes, of course.
[234:10.89]Absolutely.
[234:11.63]And you know that I mean it.
[234:12.85]I keep getting this fucking huge migraine.
[234:23.29]And I feel like I'm just being controlled by something.
[234:28.25]What the fuck?
[234:30.07]I mean, they look good.
[234:32.82]They do.
[234:33.28]They look good.
[234:42.49]Everything okay in here?
[234:44.57]Yeah, no, everything's great in here.
[234:48.79]Sorry.
[234:50.03]You might know I'm not that used to cleaning up stuff.
[234:54.31]Okay.
[234:56.22]What's the problem?
[234:57.64]What's the problem?
[234:59.20]Yeah.
[235:01.38]It's a computer.
[235:02.20]You can just move it out of the way.
[235:03.14]I'm unsure how to clean it, sir.
[235:04.92]Well, just push it out of the way and you can just dust it or something.
[235:08.20]Yeah, I'll be in here.
[235:08.92]You got it.
[235:09.23]Okay, alright.
[235:09.77]You're fine.
[235:10.61]Great.
[235:12.18]I'll just move it out of the way.
[235:20.06]Oh, I like, ow.
[235:23.71]I like what they did with this.
[235:31.99]Alright, I got to go to work.
[235:32.89]Oh, that's not too loud, is it?
[235:34.38]No, it's fine.
[235:34.72]I got to go to work.
[235:35.66]I'll see you later.
[235:36.26]Have a good time.
[235:37.02]Alright, thank you.
[235:37.86]Again, I want, and this might be a little neurotic, but I like vertical lines, not horizontal, okay?
[235:44.14]You like vertical lines, not horizontal?
[235:45.44]I like vertical lines, not horizontal.
[235:46.50]You get a couch in the middle of your living room.
[235:47.90]You use the computer in your bathroom.
[235:50.00]I woke up and came here, and there was a piece of toilet paper on the floor.
[235:53.56]We prefer vertical lines.
[235:56.52]You can do horizontal if you want.
[235:58.56]I would hope.. Yeah.
[236:00.62]You can do horizontal.
[236:14.61]Not very much slack left by the way!
[236:25.89]Thank God for Uncle Ted, because otherwise I would have no fucking money.
[236:42.20]you
[241:07.65]you
[243:33.69]See you later.
[243:35.03]Goodbye.
[243:37.95]Whew.
[243:39.71]That was a good day.
[243:40.95]I feel pretty good about that day.
[243:43.05]Hungry, thirsty, ready.
[243:47.12]But I made some money and that's good, right?
[243:49.72]It's still kind of a mess out there.
[243:50.94]I really wish the... I really wish... That was fun.
[243:56.18]Goodbye, yup, see you later.
[243:58.66]I didn't press it.
[244:00.86]I gotta get the doorbell looked at.
[244:02.14]I need like an electrician.
[244:05.72]Okay.
[244:09.88]Why is this open?
[244:13.14]Why is this open?
[244:23.51]It looks pretty clean in here.
[244:25.96]Not bad.
[244:27.34]I mean, it could be a little better, but whatever.
[244:44.00]Hi.
[244:47.98]How dare you just walk in when I'm cleaning?
[244:50.72]The shoes are in the bed.
[244:51.98]What?
[244:52.54]You had your shoes on.
[244:53.20]I took them off.
[244:53.84]I'm not a psycho.
[244:54.50]I don't sleep with my shoes on.
[244:55.68]But you took your shoes off and the shoes were in the bed with you.
[244:57.74]Why weren't they on the side of the bed?
[244:58.98]Because I was cleaning the bed and I put them on the side of the bed.
[245:01.16]You weren't here for that.
[245:02.42]Anyway, it took me a little bit longer today, so it's going to be $300.
[245:06.94]Okay.
[245:07.84]Is that because you slept in the room, or is that because you do... You don't talk to me like that.
[245:14.73]No, I was... Amelia, it was... No, it's fine.
[245:18.55]I was just saying, like, I come home from work and you're in bed.
[245:20.47]I picked up a piece of toilet paper with poop on it, but I'm the one to blame.
[245:24.92]There's been more than one person here.
[245:26.36]There's been at least four people here.
[245:27.70]I found a pair of pants with poop on it.
[245:29.94]Did you poop yourself?
[245:32.06]I'm wearing the same pants I was five days ago.
[245:35.37]That's even more concerning.
[245:37.12]And by the way, I may have pooped my pants, but goodness gracious, I mean, you look great.
[245:44.95]And I think that you and I could probably maybe go out sometime.
[245:49.20]Well, I don't know.
[245:50.30]I'll see what I'm doing tomorrow.
[245:52.18]Let's call 300 and I'll be on my way.
[245:54.08]Sure, $300.
[245:54.32]Great.
[245:54.56]Hey, it's been great.
[245:58.10]It's been fantastic.
[245:59.90]We should go out sometime.
[246:01.40]You want to go out sometime?
[246:02.15]Well, I just said I might be free tomorrow.
[246:05.25]Yeah, but I've got a wild schedule.
[246:08.61]Can I confirm it?
[246:10.69]Sure.
[246:11.25]Okay.
[246:12.27]I don't think I want to shake your hand after you said you picked yourself.
[246:15.30]How about this one?
[246:16.28]Great.
[246:32.05]Looks like I got a date.
[246:40.61]You know, there are three to four options when you get a choice.
[246:50.02]There's a few different things you can choose from each time.
[246:54.11]I'm not sure you're aware of that at this point.
[247:01.15]I feel pretty good, although I'm very hungry.
[247:04.27]Can I eat something?
[247:22.46]What are you going to do?
[247:24.84]That's the first time I've looked at chat in like four plus hours or so.
[247:28.52]I saw minus twos.
[247:30.95]Thank you.
[247:31.31]I love the same loaf of bread every time.
[247:55.78]This bread has lasted a long time.
[248:05.07]I hope my hands are really clean.
[248:06.17]I've been cleaning them.
[248:10.33]I'm actually glad I'm wearing these gloves because I mean, they're just, they're absolutely gross, but I really am happy I have them on.
[248:21.63]I have an apple too.
[248:22.37]Why would I not eat the apple?
[248:39.36]I wanna hang out in here.
[248:49.91]I'm gonna sit down.
[248:52.07]God, you work all day, you come back, you just wanna sit on your bed.
[248:59.57]Why were they sleeping in here?
[249:06.20]I could've pay you hundreds of dollars.
[249:08.98]to sleep in the bed?
[249:11.72]Like, I wonder how... I was gone for six and a half hours.
[249:15.00]I bet you they were sleeping in this bed for four.
[249:20.57]What?
[249:28.29]I'm not gonna... I'm not smelling anything.
[249:36.69]I want this bed fucking removed from the house.
[249:39.56]Alright, let's do some twitch.tv streaming.
[249:59.09]Every time.
[250:08.26]Okay, let's go.
[250:10.36]Get these, I gotta get at least one off, right?
[250:17.41]Okay, let's go live.
[250:21.33]So we're gonna do some JermaCraft, some Minecraft.
[250:23.93]Why don't we call this episode one, Live JermaCraft.
[250:31.38]And let's go live.
[250:36.02]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[250:38.36]Jerma here with episode one of JermaCraft.
[250:42.70]You know, of course, a series where I play Minecraft.
[250:45.15]And it's gonna be really fun.
[250:46.43]It's gonna be a lot of trials, a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails.
[250:50.19]And... I don't know.
[251:11.18]Thank you.
[257:08.34]Bye.
[258:28.71]That was a funny dream.
[258:32.39]So, by the way, before I turn the stream off, everybody, I just want to say, if you go to Jerma985.com, we've got merchandise for you.
[258:43.51]We've got posters for you.
[258:44.87]We've got all kinds of things you can get, and some of them might even be signed, too.
[258:49.29]Oh, sorry.
[258:49.63]I'm talking to you guys, too.
[258:51.63]Have a good day.
[258:53.13]I'm not even online.
[258:53.85]The stream's been off for, like, the last three hours.
[258:59.75]I'm gonna get banned for two days.
[259:03.17]Am I gonna get permanently banned from Twitch if I do that again?
[259:06.01]Just don't do that again.
[259:07.07]I actually might not be able to stream again.
[259:08.75]If you want income, don't do that.
[259:18.42]So that's what I heard.
[259:23.06]Oh, cool!
[259:23.82]A bunk bed!
[259:36.39]It's another mystery box!
[259:38.51]Oh my goodness, I wonder what's in this one!
[259:42.73]God, you give people a loot box option and that's what they're gonna pick like 3 out of 10 times.
[259:47.09]Which would be 30%, which is not that much.
[259:48.55]I mean like 5 out of 10.
[259:49.87]Which would be 50.
[259:50.23]How about let's go 8 out of 10.
[259:59.87]You couldn't have put anything else in there, in here.
[260:03.05]You couldn't put like rubber duckies or something.
[260:04.99]It's three more stools.
[260:07.64]This is the biggest bait ever.
[260:08.80]You're just, people will probably be pissed.
[260:12.68]Okay.
[260:16.94]Alright.
[260:17.58]Well, let's get this out of the way.
[260:22.32]I heard an explosion in this room.
[260:27.83]This bed is... I'm moving this.
[260:30.99]Get this out of the way.
[260:32.61]I'm putting this over here.
[260:36.29]Hold on.
[260:37.07]Let me at least get this correct here.
[260:44.02]Decorate?
[260:44.62]Yeah, I can do that.
[260:47.74]Although I do have to pee, so I would do that soon.
[260:53.60]Sure, can I get rid of the box part of the decoration?
[261:00.32]Decorate the room.
[261:00.86]Where would I want the bed?
[261:03.92]I definitely don't want the bed in front of the door.
[261:05.43]That would be a pain in the ass.
[261:08.85]Let's go with over here.
[261:11.83]Probably against the wall.
[261:12.51]I want it against the wall.
[261:15.23]That makes more sense to me.
[261:24.44]That looks good.
[261:25.26]Why would you have a bed over here?
[261:29.64]I like that.
[261:31.86]It's a twin bed, I don't have to worry about the other side, who cares?
[261:34.44]Alright, then what about the mystery box?
[261:43.40]We can put that in the corner.
[261:45.79]And then I'll put the, I'll put these in the, I don't know.
[261:52.51]What am I supposed to do with these?
[261:57.69]What a shitty bedroom.
[261:59.69]This looks like I'm still moving.
[262:02.36]Into this house.
[262:07.70]How about two over there?
[262:08.54]Put this over here.
[262:13.69]Okay, good.
[262:17.19]I have to pee real bad, like right now.
[262:22.05]How about on top of the mystery box?
[262:26.25]It's a beautiful day outside.
[262:30.24]Beautiful day.
[262:32.24]I want one of these next to the bed so I can put my legs over.
[262:35.70]That makes sense to me.
[262:39.09]There couldn't have been anything else in that box.
[262:41.41]Anything else.
[262:46.79]I don't know what to do with these.
[262:50.73]I don't even have a shelf to put anything on.
[262:54.45]That's there.
[262:55.19]That can just stay there.
[262:56.87]I don't care.
[262:58.47]That's fine.
[263:00.17]That can stay.
[263:02.23]How does it look?
[263:03.25]You like it?
[263:03.61]What do you think?
[263:06.48]Thank you.
[263:17.25]Yes, yes.
[263:17.99]This is nice, 985.
[263:19.35]This is a wonderful, wonderful place.
[263:21.43]Thank you for letting me see.
[263:22.39]I appreciate it.
[263:22.95]Do you think we should try?
[263:24.18]I don't see why we shouldn't.
[263:25.78]I think it'll make sense.
[263:27.06]Oh, it's even in tune.
[263:30.04]Oh, this is perfect.
[263:31.34]Wonderful.
[263:32.06]Why don't we start off with Psalm 985?
[263:36.04]We'll practice 985?
[263:37.20]985.
[263:37.34]That sounds good.
[263:38.34]Let's do that.
[263:39.02]985.
[263:39.38]I'm trying something new.
[263:44.84]Alright.
[263:52.82]Why do I hear the organ outside?
[263:54.86]God our father!
[263:58.22]He's our daddy!
[264:01.34]He gives us bread!
[264:04.10]I don't know why the organ's playing.
[264:07.48]He gives us bread!
[264:09.72]And who whips our heads?
[264:22.34]Hello.
[264:23.20]Hello, excuse me.
[264:27.08]Edna, how are you?
[264:29.10]I'm doing great.
[264:29.86]Who are you?
[264:32.30]Jerma, you were here a few days ago?
[264:34.22]Oh, okay.
[264:35.07]Last week?
[264:36.05]Oh, yes.
[264:36.81]Jerma, we heard you had this wonderful organ.
[264:39.97]Yes.
[264:40.75]I heard how impressive your organ was, and I just wanted to come over and play with your organ, with my choir, of course, from church.
[264:48.97]Okay.
[264:49.51]Bless you.
[264:50.69]Bless you.
[264:51.35]Bless you too.
[264:52.45]If you want to, you know, join in.
[264:53.84]Would you like to join us?
[264:55.60]Um, I don't, I'm not, I wouldn't.
[264:57.06]Why don't you just stick around and see what happens.
[265:00.48]Step on over with them, that'll be great.
[265:02.14]And your organ is so big, I'll have to use two hands.
[265:05.50]Here we go.
[265:06.00]I think you use two hands to play an organ.
[265:07.44]Yes.
[265:09.11]I don't think you play an organ with one hand.
[265:11.05]It's not like a flute.
[265:12.85]Over here?
[265:13.85]Alright, let's take it from the top.
[265:16.52]From the top, Edmund?
[265:17.96]From the top of where?
[265:19.10]You'll figure it out.
[265:20.58]What page are we on?
[265:24.44]God came down from the land.
[265:28.29]God came down from the land.
[265:32.98]And he took us all by the hand.
[265:36.16]And he took us all by the hand.
[265:41.41]And then we started dancing.
[265:46.55]And then we started dancing.
[265:49.59]He's got the spirit.
[265:52.13]Remix.
[265:53.69]Remix.
[265:56.87]Why don't you lead us in it?
[265:58.27]Why don't you?
[265:59.27]And he came down to the land.
[266:00.71]And he came down to the land.
[266:23.56]He ate, um, he brought wine and sand.
[266:27.84]And he brought wine and sand.
[266:31.94]And then he left my front yard.
[266:35.56]And then he left my front yard.
[266:38.54]They went to the fridge.
[266:40.82]He got himself a nice big tub of lard.
[266:43.21]And went to the fridge and got a big tub of lard.
[266:46.69]I'm a get, get, get, get you drunk.
[266:49.81]Get you all drunk.
[266:51.43]On God's love.
[266:57.31]That was beautiful, but that's my organ and I'd like for you all to leave.
[267:00.24]Well, we would like our book back.
[267:01.76]Unless you, of course, would like to study on your own.
[267:04.04]We'll save it for you at the church and you can come sing with us any time.
[267:21.36]Okay.
[267:21.90]Alright.
[267:22.60]Wonderful.
[267:23.18]Thank you.
[267:23.52]Bless you.
[267:24.45]And bless this house.
[267:25.01]See you on Sunday.
[267:25.57]Thank you.
[267:25.87]Please actually do that a few times because there's been a lot of fucking weirdos here.
[267:29.27]Bye now.
[267:30.07]Bye now.
[267:30.53]I'm sorry.
[267:31.91]What?
[267:35.15]Have a great day.
[267:36.95]Alright.
[267:38.23]I don't want to hear that many.
[267:48.78]But wait, wait a minute.
[267:49.62]Wait a second.
[267:52.10]Hey, wait, wait a minute.
[267:54.31]Wait, I really, I want that book.
[267:56.05]I want that book.
[267:57.55]I THINK THE BOOK... CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE BOOKS?
[267:59.63]YES, SIR.
[268:00.25]THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[268:01.21]I'D LOVE ONE OF THESE BOOKS.
[268:01.97]CAN I KEEP IT?
[268:02.61]YES, YOU MAY.
[268:03.35]YOU PROBABLY SHOULD.
[268:07.13]WHAT PASSAGE SHOULD I READ FROM TO GET RID OF BEARS AND PEOPLE THAT I DON'T WANT IN THE HOUSE?
[268:11.61]Jeremiah 985 IS ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE CHAPTER.
[268:16.65]OKAY.
[268:17.26]HERE.
[268:20.30]I'LL PUT IT IN THE MAILBOX.
[268:21.30]YES, PROBABLY GOOD.
[268:23.94]YOU'LL FIND IT.
[268:29.81]Good job, sister.
[268:30.77]Very good.
[268:31.25]I hope they're still there.
[268:34.81]I really hope they're still here.
[268:42.02]What an embarrassment.
[268:58.06]I don't want to play this too loud because they'll come back.
[269:07.50]I'm fucking hungry.
[269:08.84]I'm tired and I have not showered.
[269:11.23]Do you hear that?
[269:24.40]Thank you.
[269:39.48]How does she not know who I am?
[269:40.66]She's been here like, she was here like fucking a week ago.
[269:46.77]That's over budget of farting.
[269:52.09]That's definitely over fart budget.
[270:00.67]Better.
[270:03.55]Thank goodness.
[270:09.58]Oh yeah.
[270:18.52]I brush my teeth every time I get in the shower.
[270:21.60]Every time.
[270:23.42]Saves like two minutes each day.
[270:26.70]That's too over budget.
[270:29.41]That's too many.
[270:34.15]I know it's fun to do that.
[270:38.89]No, I know it's really-you know what?
[270:40.27]Just get them all out of your system right now.
[270:41.78]I'll shit in the shower.
[270:43.06]Get them out of your system.
[271:07.33]You need a lot of characters in your time.
[271:10.45]But character development and internal characterization of yourself is very important.
[271:15.98]The more you think about who you are as a person and what you do, the deeds you do, that's how you can shape yourself as a person.
[271:24.30]Or, if you want to know, fill words to make yourself sound intelligent.
[271:33.55]Oh, should I have a date?
[271:36.96]I have a date with a maid.
[271:39.90]Fuck.
[271:40.90]Right now?
[271:41.26]I don't want to bail on Amelia.
[271:46.59]That would be a mistake.
[271:57.60]I'm just so tired.
[272:00.30]No, they'll understand.
[272:02.16]They'll understand.
[272:02.88]It's fine.
[272:04.06]This is too comfy.
[272:06.23]Another time.
[272:06.69]I'll text him or something.
[272:07.63]I'll just let him know.
[272:08.61]I'll just text him.
[280:02.88]Kind of comfy, but what did I miss?
[280:07.29]Oh, I had a date.
[280:11.53]It's okay.
[280:14.11]Oh, my back hurts.
[280:26.09]Oh, my knee.
[280:28.59]You can't sleep sitting down.
[280:37.88]Not bad.
[280:38.30]I felt worse.
[280:51.13]Okay.
[280:57.13]I had a bed already.
[281:01.05]Hungry.
[281:01.72]This is not very stable, by the way.
[281:05.32]I'm not sure I can sleep on this.
[281:07.76]I already had a bed.
[281:09.48]Is that a bed sandwich?
[281:15.20]That's alright.
[281:21.49]I had a better bed in my dorm room in college than this.
[281:27.27]Ugh.
[281:31.29]I'm hungry.
[281:35.29]Ugh.
[281:42.75]Can I make some food, please?
[281:46.11]Am I making something to eat?
[281:47.13]I'm so hungry.
[282:00.10]I am starving.
[282:04.60]Does it matter?
[282:05.12]I don't want to eat bread for a seventh time.
[282:08.90]I really don't.
[282:15.26]Here, you know what?
[282:15.84]We're doing hot dogs.
[282:18.82]What do I got?
[282:19.58]Do I have hot dogs?
[282:21.10]No.
[282:22.56]We're doing butter and eggs, my favorite.
[282:24.90]That was very loud.
[282:25.70]Get the spatula there.
[282:40.59]So we'll go like this.
[282:46.32]Not bad.
[282:46.76]Get in there.
[282:48.48]Not bad.
[282:54.78]Another few minutes, another 30 seconds or so, should be ready to eat.
[283:01.00]There we are.
[283:03.00]Need another cup.
[283:04.00]Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops!
[283:10.00]Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit! Oh shit!

[283:34.06]Do I have anything? Do I have-
[283:39.20]Hold on- wait I think I got this. I think I have something.
[283:47.30]Give me this.
[283:51.70]Fuck!
[283:57.76]I'm going in there!
[284:05.43]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright!

[285:02.92]Everything's gonna, come here, come here.
[285:05.82]Shit, I can't fucking hit him.

[285:18.79]Somebody's at the door!
[285:21.86]I can't fight this motherfucker!
