[00:18.58]No, you can't.
[00:22.36]But why?
[00:22.94]Oh, there we go.
[00:37.44]I think it's working.

[00:46.73]That's really loud, sorry.
[00:55.70]Alright, hold on.
[00:57.54]Hold on.
[00:59.72]Almost ready.
[01:03.69]Make my audio delayed.
[01:08.07]Just watch the video.
[01:09.17]Like, Flash?
[01:09.51]No?
[01:09.81]You guys are gonna tell me this is insane, so... I'm not gonna be able to tell.
[01:44.91]I'm sorry, I just skipped I do have the DLC for this game, too
[02:14.11]Why?
[02:14.81]Because I just did.
[02:17.99]Painfully low on data.
[02:19.79]Here we go.
[02:38.94]The ball flew up and away into the depths of the great cosmos, leaving a great hole in the sky.
[02:42.46]Oh dear.
[02:54.18]King made a black hole playing tennis.
[02:59.67]Consumed the whole planet.
[03:04.07]All suffered the same fate.
[03:05.08]They all got sucked in.
[03:06.06]That's not good.
[03:24.20]Have I played this one before?
[03:25.32]Um, maybe.
[03:28.26]I don't remember.
[03:30.26]I've just... I don't remember.
[03:32.62]I never played this game enough to remember anything about it.
[03:41.68]Well, this is a pickle.
[03:44.53]Daikon, dill, and cabbage.
[03:46.55]Sorry.
[03:50.31]Most of the stars in the cosmos are gone!
[03:55.33]This is where we come in.
[03:58.03]We always save the day.
[04:01.05]Side by side, we'll save the cosmos, Prince.
[04:08.44]But you're the sidekick.
[04:10.50]Just so that's clear.
[04:14.52]Do you want a cape, bunny ears, and wings?
[04:19.29]Anyhow, we want you to assist us with this one.
[04:25.75]By a stroke of luck, Earth is still there.
[04:31.23]So go roll lots and lots of ginormous catamaris.
[04:39.91]We'll do the hard work of turning them into stars.
[04:46.71]We'll take care of that pesky black hole, too.
[04:53.04]Ready to turn out some colossal katamaris.
[04:58.27]Okay, time to get going.
[05:02.37]The cosmos needs our help.
[05:15.49]Yeah, this is not the remake.
[05:16.95]This is... This is like Katamari 3 or 4, isn't it?
[05:21.47]Maybe even 5.
[05:23.25]What does it say in release?
[05:25.77]3?

[05:48.49]If you do well, this Katamari will become a moon.
[05:51.58]Profound, yes.
[05:53.02]We have that effect on everyone.
[05:55.42]Give it a spin and pop it on top of that platform.

[06:29.21]Who knew?
[06:36.47]Yes, I remember Feels so wonderful
[06:52.05]This is as satisfying as pulling out chest hairs with a tweezer.
[06:56.87]Did I just say that out loud?

[26:20.09]The tea kettle?
[26:29.36]Oasis Cafe.
[26:30.40]Alright.
[26:32.44]Roll up drinks to make Mercury.
[26:42.66]Welcome to Oasis Cafe, a rest for the wicked.
[26:45.44]For you, more work.
[26:46.40]Help us make Mercury.
[26:48.38]We need lots and lots of things to drink.
[26:50.42]Like water, juice, tea, milk.
[26:53.18]Mercury should be plump and juicy.
[26:55.90]Like peeled grapes.
[26:56.90]Mmm, what skin tastes weird.
[26:59.67]Off to Earth.
[27:00.13]See you later.
[27:05.89]Now connecting to...
[27:11.41]I didn't even see the last one.
[27:20.76]They did surgery on a grape.
[27:22.14]I don't remember that.
[27:25.84]Time to roll.
[27:26.28]We're in a candy store.
[27:27.50]Love mom and pop places.
[27:28.96]They're yummy and cheap.
[27:30.80]Are you going to eat that?
[27:31.72]Because if you aren't... Oh, yeah, right.
[27:33.76]The Katamari.
[27:34.70]If you roll to be this big, 50 centimeters in five minutes.
[27:44.15]Don't drink too much.
[27:44.93]There's no bathroom.
[27:46.97]Alright.
[27:51.82]Let's get every piece up here.
[27:53.30]Or at least 60% of them.
[28:13.19]Turn the music up?
[28:14.45]Nobody even said that, but I assume they did.
[28:16.55]Alright, I need drinks.
[28:19.61]Okay, what about over here?
[28:23.47]Oh.
[28:40.46]That's a good start.
[28:41.14]Except there's weird... There's like animals up here.
[28:43.82]What the hell is this thing?
[28:46.36]Frogs?
[28:46.91]Present!
[28:47.49]Got it.
[28:49.65]Yeah, let's make a way down.
[28:55.09]It's a present!
[29:10.50]So what's in it?
[29:10.96]Do we know?
[29:13.22]I gotta get all those drinks.
[29:19.00]Alright, 15.
[29:19.78]Alright, there we go.
[29:25.67]Can I get in there?
[29:26.25]That's a chunk.
[29:38.60]I got like four minutes.
[29:42.58]You can relax.
[29:45.00]Bigger Katamari means you can leave the shop.
[29:48.51]It does, but not yet.
[29:52.95]Not big enough to get that?
[29:54.69]Of course not.
[29:58.11]I need drinks.
[30:00.39]I gotta pick up every pallet of drinks.
[30:02.07]Alright, let's go.
[30:14.15]We asked you to bake.
[30:16.51]Alright.
[30:17.03]King, can you, like, fucking come through, like, the PlayStation 4 controller speaker?
[30:22.51]Not big enough.
[30:27.13]Floating eggs give the egg.
[30:29.09]I need more drinks.
[30:30.31]Back in the store.
[30:30.99]Or at least over here.
[30:38.17]Does that really even matter?
[30:40.48]I don't think it does.
[30:46.31]Water.
[30:46.89]Nope.
[30:50.75]Alright, back in the store.
[30:54.41]Wait, there's like a grocery store right here.
[31:02.68]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[31:08.30]Up on the shelf.
[31:09.08]Get it!
[31:20.83]50 alright.
[31:22.59]Alright back in the store.
[31:25.11]Oh
[31:50.89]I wanna get back in here.
[31:52.17]Can I get in there anymore?
[31:56.06]I'm not sure I can even go in here.
[32:04.92]Ah, whatever.
[32:08.88]Not a strike.
[32:10.12]Reset the whole thing.
[32:16.93]Eat the kid.
[32:21.42]You can't.
[32:22.06]I'm not big enough.
[32:29.07]All the candy apples.
[32:29.83]Check this out.
[32:34.21]Come on.
[32:34.65]I need those.
[32:37.75]Yeah.
[32:38.07]65.
[32:38.65]There.
[32:57.75]The economy is as big as 6 000 squids Let me do you a favor here turn the volume up
[33:17.30]Got a Katamari to show us?
[33:19.19]I'll bring it out.
[33:20.35]This is the Katamari, a mere 65 centimeters.
[33:23.13]Snacks, drinks, food.
[33:39.84]Looks like you managed to get some stuff.
[33:42.00]Hardly any drinks.
[33:43.02]Let's see, 33 points.
[33:43.89]I'm not doing this on purpose.
[33:46.49]I'm just pretending.
[33:48.17]And friends, we can save a time.
[34:04.97]A trace of earnestness!
[34:08.09]Aha!
[34:08.35]Master Kunihiro!
[34:11.11]All packed and labeled for a trip to the princedom.
[34:14.19]Yay for a star.
[34:15.27]Uhuru.
[34:18.49]That guy's kind of cool looking.
[34:27.46]You're a party pooper.
[34:28.12]Learn to roll better.
[34:32.11]two for ten gold alright where's that other weirdo I know they're called cousins but I just I'm gonna reference them as weirdos that's that a new place
[35:02.63]Okay, so that's on.
[35:05.93]Looks pretty cool.
[35:06.75]The game is so loud.
[35:08.55]Sorry.
[35:08.87]Alright.
[35:09.87]Where's the next... what progression?
[35:12.09]Is that... oh, this is CatFade.
[35:14.18]This is DLC.
[35:39.84]Okay, nothing over here.
[35:41.64]Maybe the other side?
[35:43.88]That looks new.
[35:47.78]Lady Luck Casino.
[35:57.56]There we go.
[36:10.44]This is DLC?
[36:10.84]Whatever.
[36:11.12]I don't think it is.
[36:11.82]Doesn't have a planet if it's DLC?
[36:13.28]For that, we need a lot of expensive stuff.
[36:15.98]Metals, jewels, honey.
[36:17.48]Are we right or are we not?
[36:19.80]Answer us.
[36:20.20]Off to Earth.
[36:20.66]Let's see you later.
[36:44.07]Yeah, the Saturn icon is DLC.
[36:46.29]Yeah.
[36:47.73]That's true.
[36:57.46]These games are just so relaxing.
[37:03.22]Dead Rising 2 Endgame to this is like... There's one extreme to another.
[37:10.51]I'm just chilling right now.
[37:13.65]It has a glam vibe.
[37:14.75]It's totally simpatico with us.
[37:19.73]Oh, yes, the Katamari.
[37:20.87]If you roll this big 60 and 50, let's go.
[37:28.13]Five minutes.
[37:31.03]Going straight for the cards, what do you think?
[37:41.83]Yeah.
[37:41.99]Hmm, a Mustang.
[37:50.73]I felt that one in my chest
[38:15.64]Yeah Chip
[38:42.40]Yep, I can get him.
[38:43.39]The word's blocked.
[38:49.81]That's already how I feel.
[38:54.77]When you run to something and you go, can I get that?
[38:58.49]Can I get that?
[39:00.09]Can I get that?
[39:01.63]And the answer is yes.
[39:08.30]It takes a whole damn thing.
[39:10.46]The game's allowed?
[39:15.02]Did he say something?
[39:18.68]There.
[39:20.67]I got you.
[39:26.63]Is this guy talking?
[39:27.57]I can't hear him.
[39:37.42]I'm kind of behind.
[39:40.30]Should do it, I guess.
[39:47.31]Ooh, not up to 20 yet.
[39:48.81]Did I bounce off a dog?
[39:50.43]The bigger kind of arm is you go outside now.
[39:54.68]I don't think I want to do that yet.
[40:00.04]I think maybe I have to.
[40:11.46]Yeah, I'm gonna go, sorry.
[40:13.14]Is this technically outside?
[40:14.40]No, this is just a weirder room inside.
[40:16.86]Shit.
[40:39.53]Oh, I gotta make something happen really really really soon here
[41:08.35]I can't pick up the bearded dragon
[41:35.75]Only one minute.
[41:36.95]I'm almost- actually, that's just... Going back and forth.
[41:39.19]Right here.
[41:39.86]Holy shit.
[41:40.24]Wow.
[41:55.61]Well, uh... I found a way to make that happen immediately.
[42:02.81]Oh, go up the stairs, quick!
[42:11.92]Go up the stairs!
[42:13.02]Look at that thing!
[42:13.76]I can't get it.
[42:15.64]Go!
[42:17.98]Get upstairs!
[42:18.68]Look at all this stuff!
[42:21.11]Yes!
[42:24.61]Just run in the direction and you'll get something.
[42:44.81]Nice.
[42:48.01]Now you know why the game is so satisfying?
[42:51.29]Yeah, because you can go from...
[42:54.79]40 centimeters to, like, 100 in 12 seconds.
[43:01.90]Well, there's the expensive thing he wanted.
[43:03.94]Gold bars, right?
[43:06.44]Alright, this is for Venus.
[43:12.34]90 centimeters.
[43:18.49]What do you got?
[43:21.72]Games, Rich, and Snacks.
[43:25.17]Games.
[43:25.61]Yes, looks like you managed to get some stuff.
[43:28.29]Hardly any expensive stuff.
[43:29.73]That's like 50 million dollars worth of gold in there, man.
[43:33.13]43 points.
[43:34.89]Stop pretending.
[43:35.72]God damn it.
[43:51.78]That's nothing to a king.
[43:53.26]Doesn't take up much space.
[43:56.80]First cheat code, Venus.
[44:02.34]Cheat code.
[44:11.37]Huh.
[44:11.55]Alright.
[44:13.09]Sunrise Castle.
[44:16.89]Making a comet now.
[44:26.98]If you roll the right, the cosmos gets a comic.
[44:29.98]What you need are lots of Japanese things.
[44:32.74]Ninja, sushi, sukiyaki, bullet trains, and kimonos.
[44:37.00]I have a fancy for a classic kind of comic.
[44:41.19]Give us Katamaru to write home about, please.
[44:43.81]After.
[44:47.03]The Rugrats.
[44:50.29]Yeah, there is a Rugrats vibe from that music.
[44:55.20]Hold on, I need to hear it.
[45:00.88]Rugrats bop music.
[45:10.94]Rugrats... What would it be called?
[45:15.23]Rugrats weird music.
[45:24.39]Rugrats theme?
[45:25.45]No, no, no, no, no.
[45:26.25]It's like, it's not just the theme.
[45:27.84]The theme doesn't do it.
[45:33.08]No, that's not, that happens during episodes when they're walking around.
[45:41.36]What you're referring to is that like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[45:48.00]Happens way more often like this in the episodes.
[45:53.09]Like, Tommy will get up and start walking, and it'll be like, bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.
[46:02.98]Here we go.
[46:03.38]Alright, we need... Give me that chocolate.
[46:27.38]I know I'm going slow, but sometimes you have to.
[46:29.88]I gotta get all the chocolates.
[46:36.23]Come on.
[46:37.29]Come on.
[46:38.25]Clamp it.
[46:38.65]Clamp it.
[46:39.05]Clamp it.
[46:40.25]Yeah.
[46:43.68]I got tops.
[46:45.30]And I can move back this way.
[46:46.40]Let's clear this whole rack.
[46:47.56]Wait a sec.
[46:54.76]Am I already big enough to pick this up?
[46:59.06]At least these things?
[47:04.79]Yep.
[47:05.43]I got a decent amount of time, too.
[47:18.78]Oh, cookie dough.
[47:21.84]I can't believe this is just me at the grocery store.
[47:26.32]She's like, I want that.
[47:28.90]Give me that too.
[47:29.36]I want that.
[47:29.84]I want all that.
[47:30.94]Let's get four cookie doughs.
[47:34.92]I think we need one cookie dough.
[47:36.76]No, let's get four.
[47:41.80]Why?
[47:45.40]Because we'll make like 80 cookies.
[47:49.67]I do the same shit when I order pizza.
[47:50.81]How many of you guys have ever ordered pizza before?
[47:56.89]And you're sitting there going, alright, pizza.
[47:58.59]Anybody want pizza?
[47:59.95]No?
[48:00.17]I don't want one.
[48:01.77]You want any pizza?
[48:02.57]You, other person that's here?
[48:03.55]No?
[48:03.93]Okay, well I'm gonna get two large pizzas.
[48:08.01]And eat like four or five slices.
[48:11.57]And that's it.
[48:11.98]And then it goes in the fridge.
[48:15.97]You can reheat pizza?
[48:16.81]Yeah, but it's never the same.
[48:18.67]I know some people love it, but... Did I miss a present?
[48:22.29]Was I talking?
[48:22.83]Cold pizza?
[48:28.11]Yeah, but it... the grease, like, solidifies.
[48:30.77]And it turns into this weird... I don't like it.
[48:37.14]I mean, I'm not saying I won't heat it up and eat it.
[48:46.53]I also feel the same way about, for instance, a steak and cheese sub.
[48:50.61]It does not matter what the circumstance is.
[48:54.33]I've tried a million times, there's no way.
[48:56.11]I think I brought this up maybe a week or two ago.
[48:58.45]Somebody brought up eating and eating one meal a day or whatever.
[49:02.59]If there's a steak and cheese in front of me, it's going to be gone.
[49:06.89]I'm not going to have any leftovers.
[49:10.98]This thing could be like 16 inches long, and I'm going to eat the whole thing.
[49:16.48]I never have a leftover when I have a hero, or like a grinder.
[49:21.36]Ever.
[49:22.52]It's never happening.
[49:25.40]Come on, get up there.
[49:30.74]Come on, I need to get the stuff on top.
[49:34.64]Come on!
[49:35.64]Look at how much stuff there is up here!
[49:37.76]Come on!
[49:38.28]Climb it!
[49:38.71]Go up from here as well.
[49:41.41]Keep going outside.
[49:46.25]Can I get pets?
[49:55.89]Nope.
[49:58.24]Didn't you eat a grinder from your car a little while back?
[50:03.74]Alright, you're making that sound like I opened up the hood and cooked it on the engine.
[50:09.60]Technically, no.
[50:11.10]I bought it and left it in the car.
[50:19.17]And it was a turkey sandwich.
[50:22.37]And I... It wasn't very good.
[50:25.45]I did not eat it.
[50:30.92]Hey, don't do that.
[50:32.16]Disgusting?
[50:34.04]Yes, it was.
[50:34.75]That's why I didn't want to eat it.
[50:43.97]I've got to... Two minutes?
[50:47.83]Might go back inside.
[50:51.16]You did it, and you're a liar.
[50:58.16]I'm really fucking with my image right now.
[51:05.59]Under one minute, how big is he being?
[51:14.57]Uh oh.
[51:15.59]Alright, back in the house.
[51:27.96]Is it gonna be 100?
[51:29.57]It's gotta be 200?
[51:39.08]No, it does not. 200!
[51:53.79]Oh, this ain't happening.
[51:54.51]I'm gonna have to do it again.
[52:04.54]Nope.
[52:06.74]Wasted too much time inside.
[52:10.30]I messed around too much in the shop.
[52:15.98]Can someone please explain this to us?
[52:18.04]Why do we always get our heart broken?
[52:20.21]What is with Kunihiro?
[52:21.87]Too little self-esteem?
[52:22.99]Too much?
[52:24.11]We hear that common entitlement.
[52:26.03]Wait, we get it.
[52:26.93]It's a slacker thing.
[52:28.69]What next?
[52:29.11]Video store clerk?
[52:30.05]Screenwriter?
[52:31.31]Whatever it is, we are not paying for it.
[52:33.75]Poor Poro, stuck with a loser.
[52:36.51]But if you make it big, we want the swag.
[52:38.90]This game is fucking crazy.
[52:43.50]Alright, let's do it again.
[52:47.95]Yeah, I didn't... I spent too much time dicking around on this job.
[52:58.16]Alright.
[52:59.68]Uh-huh.
[53:00.22]Two meters.
[53:04.16]I'm just going right down.
[53:07.36]Started me in a different spot.
[53:08.42]I can't climb over that?
[53:15.64]Yes I can.
[53:16.20]Let's go.
[53:26.03]Against the wall.
[53:26.53]Against the wall.
[53:27.11]Get them all.
[53:28.13]Can I pick up those things?
[53:30.35]Ugh.
[53:32.67]Ugh.
[53:33.37]They're killing me right now.
[53:36.43]Milk bottles.
[53:38.10]Get the candies.
[53:41.14]Turn.
[54:04.23]No, I can't.
[54:05.01]Nope, still can't.
[54:06.15]Alright, help this way.
[54:10.19]I gotta get outside ASAP.
[54:14.09]I don't want to get to two meters.
[54:18.77]That's not gonna happen once I get the hell out here.
[54:22.49]Alright.
[54:36.58]That was a good grab, but not enough.
[54:40.80]Have to get out there.
[54:47.94]Wait, not yet.
[54:51.17]I know, stop ticking around the shop.
[54:52.41]I know, I know, but look at all this.
[54:54.59]I didn't even mean to do that.
[55:04.92]Can't get the flowers.
[55:11.74]I can't get that.
[55:19.39]I can't get that either.
[55:20.27]I can't get any of this shit.
[55:30.68]I gotta grow now.
[55:36.92]Okay, get it.
[55:37.98]There we go.
[55:39.00]Can I actually pick up these?
[55:42.24]Oh, this stuff, like, so spread out.
[55:45.88]Cars.
[56:18.70]Please, not stuck in a wall.
[56:22.44]Get it!
[56:28.78]Go around the city, yes!
[56:32.86]I know, but I want the cake!
[56:35.25]Got it!
[56:38.21]Okay, city, city, city, city, city.
[56:54.00]Two meters!
[56:54.88]I gotta- I got two- three minutes to do it!
[57:10.95]Faster, faster, faster, faster!
[57:12.17]I'm trying!
[57:20.50]I don't wanna go in the water.
[57:34.01]It's so slow!
[57:35.77]Move!
[57:40.12]I'm not gonna make it!
[57:42.22]Yes I am.
[57:44.48]Get the people?
[57:45.12]I'm too small.
[57:45.75]I need to be a little bit, like, even to the kids.
[57:52.63]Alright, let's get back over here.
[58:02.50]Alright, I'm at one meter.
[58:03.88]This is where, this is where it steamrolls.
[58:11.20]Alright, big enough for people.
[58:20.78]Get it!
[58:21.10]40 seconds!

[62:11.07]I've seen some sloppy Jupiters.
[62:13.15]I've not seen a complete true Jupiter, though.
[62:25.78]Can't do it because of slow mode.
[62:26.92]That means you have to work together harder.
[62:31.71]There we go.
[62:33.19]It pretty much happens, yeah.
[62:34.09]That's it.
[62:34.37]Alright.

[65:39.93]That's what's in there.
[65:41.73]Who sung this?
[65:44.77]I have no idea.
[65:46.11]I think it says it in the beginning.
[65:48.51]Rewind.
[66:01.39]This person just destroyed me.
[66:04.73]I got rolled for five times by that same person.
[66:07.05]Alright, three minutes.

[69:11.55]What's with this guy?
[69:12.47]Too much of his entitled slacker, loser, idiot, stupid.

[83:04.74]I'm not gonna do it.
[83:07.40]Plants, flowers, aquarium.
[83:08.32]That's what you wanted!
[83:09.00]There are hardly any plants in here, except it's all of them.
[83:22.53]But there is a present accessory!
[83:23.87]A little flower?
[83:31.64]Never good enough, daddy.

[85:31.95]Freshly baked.
[85:32.71]Be warm, be generous, and roll a big Kakamaria.
[85:52.22]This thing's probably going to have to be like 10 meters.
[85:55.18]We've come to roll in this store.

[86:06.19]For that, you need to roll up the piping hot stuff.
[86:09.99]We'll time you until the Katamari is 10,000 degrees Celsius.
[86:15.72]What?
[86:17.14]It's not about size.
[86:18.88]Cold things will lower your temperature.
[86:27.94]Alright, sausage.
[86:34.71]Bowl of soup.

[90:17.24]Pick up the flames.
[90:17.96]Alright, 10,000.
[90:18.28]Nobody can listen to that.
[90:23.00]Alright, I'm gonna go across the water just for a second.
[90:54.68]I'm gonna pick up.
[90:57.18]Shit, it's so hard to see what I'm picking up.
[90:59.94]I just dropped... Dropping fucking viewers, man.
[91:03.66]Dropping viewers like crazy.
[91:11.62]Dude.
[91:19.58]Turkeys and shit?
[91:21.20]Oh, look at this.
[91:21.72]It's done.
[91:22.02]It's over.
[91:25.27]9,000 degrees.
[91:29.15]97, 98, 99.
[91:29.49]Viewers increasing.
[91:31.35]Oh, shit.
[91:34.23]Viewers decreasing.
[91:43.83]I won, I won, I won, I won.
[91:49.91]Imagine if viewer count was that volatile.
[91:56.63]I mean, maybe if it was ants or something.
[92:02.11]The amount of ants that tune tuned in.
[92:15.26]He sees this as ants.
[92:16.18]No, I'm talking about, like, just ants.
[92:18.66]I don't know, man.
[92:21.52]I have to stop laughing because I fucking died.
[92:24.06]Ugh.
[92:30.24]You don't just roll, Mars.
[92:31.66]You broil and brazen.
[92:35.34]Nothing big from far away.
[92:38.08]Let's see.
[92:39.08]Instant optical illusion?
[92:41.38]Please, don't.
[92:42.22]50 seconds.
[92:49.25]Food.
[92:49.53]Cooking.
[92:49.83]Drinks.
[92:50.25]Cool.
[92:50.83]Lollipop.
[92:53.33]Nice.
[92:59.98]And... a new... is it just the same person I am with Boson?
[93:03.78]57 is not a passing grade.
[93:05.18]That's an F. Anything under 60 is a failing grade.
[93:31.94]Unless they've changed schools in the last 20 years, which they may have.
[93:39.30]Have they?
[93:40.42]Alright, what do we got?
[93:49.06]I'm going to save.
[93:50.69]Should I get the lollipop?
[93:53.89]No, I don't want to get on the fucking train.
[93:57.31]Get out of here.
[94:04.43]Oh, it's just in my mouth.
[94:10.01]That's sort of strange.
[94:11.64]Under 65, unless it's curved.
[94:15.34]What?
[94:16.26]No way.
[94:18.42]Anything new down here?
[94:34.09]DLC... No... What is Dentist in my Mump?
[94:48.76]Am I missing one?
[94:55.46]Maybe to the right?
[95:06.21]go go go yes there is sea dome this is to make Neptune
[95:24.55]The Tide Palace.
[95:25.45]Roll with distinction and the cosmos gets a new Neptune.
[95:28.31]What you need are things from the big blue sea.
[95:31.19]Yachts, boats, fishies, maelstroms.
[95:34.34]Neptune should be briny and wild and free.
[95:36.92]Yes.
[95:37.40]Make a big catamari and surf it with the tribe.
[95:42.68]For classes in your discipline, you need to have usually 80 or higher or in an equal of credits to offset a grade under 70.
[95:48.50]You usually can do that for like eight credits.
[95:51.68]What have they done to our schools?
[96:06.19]What have they done to us?
[96:07.47]I don't know.
[96:07.99]Whoever is in charge.
[96:10.09]What do they do?
[96:13.69]In my college, there would be no grades.
[96:21.50]There'd be no attendance record and there'd be no grading.
[96:25.86]Everybody gets a B. People just show up and there'd be zero students in class.
[96:36.07]Alright, how big did it have to be?
[96:37.75]25 meters.
[96:38.15]No, but once a week I would have like a weird like minute to win it contest for grading.
[96:58.09]I'm just describing.
[96:59.01]There's like a TV show on ABC that is that right now.
[97:01.67]It's like, what, AP Bio with Glenn Howard?
[97:03.88]Yeah, like, that's like what I'm describing.
[97:13.38]Oh my god.
[97:17.15]It's a TV show.
[97:19.27]The guy that, Dennis from Always Sunny?
[97:21.43]Do I have to explain this or am I about to get livid that you guys don't know who that is?
[97:35.67]This thing's gonna be huge.
[97:39.99]He watches TV.
[97:41.73]Oh megalol!
[97:42.81]Well, you don't think you watch TV?
[97:49.80]That's interesting.
[97:51.70]Uh, everybody in here that said they do not watch TV.
[97:54.42]I can get you with a gachoo right now.
[97:56.52]Would you like to hear it?
[98:05.41]Where do you consume the Olympics?
[98:10.29]You know, the Olympics?
[98:18.76]That's the Star Wars theme, but it's almost exactly the same.
[98:25.30]The Olympics theme is almost the exact same as that Star Wars song.
[98:35.37]See?
[98:35.85]I just had to think about it for a second.
[98:40.67]It's just the same song.
[98:50.93]A long time.
[98:51.63]The Olympics app is free?
[99:02.48]This one's not.
[99:03.16]They have like a table subscription.
[99:11.83]Who cares about sports?
[99:22.65]I don't know.
[99:23.35]We'll see.
[99:23.73]It's going to be interesting.
[99:25.73]Because the younger crowd, with me included, you know, I'm the one.
[99:34.88]We're not watching as much sports, I don't think, as our older relatives are.
[99:59.13]Am I making this up?
[99:59.81]No.
[99:59.93]I don't think I am.
[100:08.36]I'm not making this up.
[100:13.48]I've been, like, sports attendance, like, last five years or something.
[100:18.56]I can't be making this up.
[100:23.35]There's no way this is wrong.
[100:24.95]My source is just some drunk guy at a bar one time.
[100:35.55]NFL viewership is rising.
[100:40.23]Okay, I've been hit by every car that came down the road.
[100:48.06]Can we just be clear about that?
[100:58.27]I'm gonna get some houses here.
[101:06.84]You're the one in the road.
[101:12.14]I know.
[101:16.32]If you hit one more car, I'm gonna leave.
[101:19.72]Does it count if I crush it?
[101:24.60]That's what happened.
[101:35.67]Oh, look at this.
[101:36.29]Oh.
[101:41.25]Oh, what's there?
[101:44.77]That last one was so much harder than this.
[101:53.52]Get a couple of islands.
[101:54.34]Go to the circus.
[102:11.98]This is where it gets crazy here.
[102:13.20]All the cars.
[102:14.90]Yup.
[102:15.56]Ahhhh.
[102:20.72]Out of the way.
[102:22.20]Something's round.
[102:23.45]You got Marnie.
[102:24.29]I think that's Marnie.
[102:25.33]Elements?
[102:26.01]Yes.
[102:26.41]Am I big enough for the boats?
[102:37.60]We'll find out.
[102:44.99]Not quite the boats, but the big ducks.
[102:47.39]These ducks are huge.
[102:52.44]And yes, they're boats, I know.
[102:58.42]Oh, almost.
[102:58.96]One more, and I can pick up all the buildings.
[103:07.72]Not quite.
[103:13.68]Thirteen.
[103:19.50]I don't want thirteen.
[103:21.10]Can't fix one yet.
[103:26.88]Maybe RVs?
[103:30.18]That's a bunch of mushrooms up there.
[103:35.53]Come on, you can't get up there.
[103:37.63]Whatever.
[103:39.27]Not worth it.
[103:46.02]I can get some of the houses.
[103:47.18]Not all of them.
[103:54.29]I'm gonna go back around.
[104:01.11]Let's go over here.
[104:09.62]Oooh.
[104:10.06]God.
[104:17.85]Come on and get the- don't get stuck!
[104:44.10]And over.
[104:48.20]But wait, there's more over there Stop picking up small things Don't pick up small things Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop You wanna know how I read that copypasta?
[105:12.29]Watching you do this is so aggravating.
[105:17.51]You continue to pick up small items, and it's not... What's the king doing?
[105:27.04]Resignation?
[105:28.66]Put that silly ball down and come over here.
[105:38.00]Hold on, Phil?
[105:45.20]What did I need?
[105:48.13]It was 25.
[105:48.67]I thought it was... Oh, I thought it was 20.
[105:52.07]That's why.
[105:52.43]I was picking up the small items.
[105:56.17]It was 25?
[105:56.63]Oh, that's not good.
[105:57.47]Well, I thought it was 20.
[106:18.33]Shit, I would have taken that a lot more seriously.
[106:20.43]Damn it.
[106:24.51]Eight minutes.
[106:25.88]Alright, no fucking around.
[106:39.34]Let's go.
[106:42.93]Anyone notice this?
[106:46.97]I really like when Jerma starts to understand he has to really try and do the game.
[106:51.41]I always think it's so inspiring when he starts to do so well because he knows he has to win.
[106:58.97]First comment.
[107:01.09]Me too.
[107:05.67]I love that when he really needed to get to the end of that.
[107:08.11]I actually have beaten Dead Rising 2 a bunch of times.
[107:12.07]And I can't believe he didn't restart.
[107:14.77]He played through just one and done.
[107:16.61]That's pretty remarkable, if I were to say so.
[107:19.52]New Thread.
[107:21.30]Hey, why don't you just... Okay, I'm done.
[107:39.67]Okay, that's a wide... I thought he was like just... is that a urinal?
[107:42.95]What is he riding?
[107:47.27]Alright, okay.
[107:53.26]Just put the image of him kissing himself.
[108:03.93]Can I get the hearts?
[108:05.21]Fuck.
[108:06.41]Bad timing here.
[108:07.71]I'm just doing so poorly.
[108:46.01]I can't pick him up?
[108:51.09]Yes I can.
[108:53.74]Alright, now I gotta actually really pay attention.
[109:04.64]Now that I can get pretty much all this stuff in one shot.
[109:10.44]Three feet.
[109:11.50]Not there yet.
[109:18.93]I think all the paneling
[109:48.43]Let's get all the people sitting over here, and then I'm gonna go over the ledge.
[109:54.62]What are they listening to?
[110:01.27]That's pretty big Katamari.
[110:02.41]I know, I just said Katamari.
[110:05.47]I know.
[110:24.08]Stay here and get it all.
[110:26.30]Go this way.
[110:55.20]Alright.
[110:56.54]Now I gotta really string it together.
[110:58.60]Every road.
[111:00.94]Every car.
[111:05.72]Traffic right here.
[111:06.52]I gotta go one more up.
[111:09.36]Up one more.
[111:09.86]Up one more!
[111:12.35]I'll maybe do it again.
[111:13.15]25, right?
[111:35.70]Turn around, we're going back the same way.
[111:39.40]Ready?
[111:45.30]Buses.
[111:45.66]Can I not get the buses?
[111:49.28]No, not yet.
[112:13.42]oh am I gonna feel it again alright that's really possible actually it's very possible
[112:44.98]Freeze.
[112:45.73]Help.
[112:47.51]Might be picking me up.
[113:00.20]I might not have to leave here.
[113:04.68]Eighteen, come on!
[113:09.76]Give me the big ones!
[113:11.33]Give me the big red ones!
[113:16.75]I'm stuck!
[113:26.14]Oh, fuck!
[113:27.92]Oh, fuck!
[113:31.96]Oh, fuck!
[113:35.44]Give me the whales!
[113:36.79]I got them all?
[113:52.38]I don't want to do it again.
[113:54.22]Where's the most concentration?
[114:00.07]There's a lot of concentrated shit over here.
[114:05.21]I'm good.
[114:06.65]I'm good.
[114:15.62]No, not choking.
[114:16.52]No choke this time.
[114:19.39]Let's do it another time.
[114:26.42]I'm just steady.
[114:28.03]Oh, save.
[114:29.11]Drama, you're huge.
[114:58.59]Ocean!
[114:58.97]Plants!
[114:59.58]Yay!
[115:03.18]I would love to see King of Cosmos in Smash Bros.
[115:15.85]That'd be pretty great, actually.
[115:25.40]Is he too big?
[115:26.82]He's too big, too big.
[115:28.18]That's the, that's the Ridley argument.
[115:31.32]Yay for a star.
[115:32.26]Neptune.
[115:58.83]He's planet-sized, so I'll make him a stage.
[116:00.27]Ooh.
[116:03.11]There's a rainbow.
[116:11.88]Aww, it goes nowhere.
[116:12.84]What's the next level?
[116:15.44]Egg school, then...
[116:33.35]I see two, actually.
[116:34.57]Interesting.
[116:37.11]Cool house.
[116:37.79]I'm gonna have to go here.
[116:40.75]Well, this one is just like the hot one.
[116:42.85]It's the cold one.
[116:50.69]Pluto.
[116:52.71]Honey, there are lots of cold, cold things.
[116:54.51]Like snow, ice, icebergs, fridges.
[116:58.03]We want a cold Pluto for when we need to cool off.
[117:01.19]A wet washcloth planet, a dark room with a star.
[117:04.37]Anywho.
[117:12.53]Slip.
[117:13.55]Shy.
[117:14.66]Can-can.
[117:25.12]Look at all those Xbox controllers.
[117:26.85]Oh, this place again.
[117:28.91]Kunihiro.
[117:29.45]Remember this place, yes?
[117:32.33]We have been here many times before.
[117:34.45]That's right, it's the money dimension.
[117:38.14]We understand that money can't buy everything.
[117:40.44]But it's nice to have a lot, yes.
[117:42.56]So, anywho.
[117:45.33]One meter in three minutes.
[117:53.78]That seems... hard.
[117:59.19]One of the best controllers ever made.
[118:08.70]Picking it up right now.
[118:10.22]Can I get the ice creams that are on the...
[118:17.95]What's going on?
[118:20.27]Hey!
[118:21.27]Gimme those!
[118:23.51]You dick!
[118:24.63]What?
[118:25.21]Look at all these Xboxes.
[118:27.01]Oh, so this is where they keep all the ones with red ring.
[118:44.97]I mean, that's an average household amount of Xboxes that you've had to send back.
[118:48.41]Oh, here's the sponsored stage.
[119:16.56]I get it.
[119:17.18]Roll up cool things.
[119:18.58]The Xbox.
[119:19.94]They're really cool, huh?
[119:21.92]Can I get the Xboxes?
[119:31.10]Not yet.
[119:41.94]Alright, I don't think punching the wrist is...
[119:45.16]I'm gonna get down to one meter.
[119:52.31]Up here?
[119:53.67]Honey Gravitas.
[119:54.33]There we go.
[119:54.97]Shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[120:11.14]Xbox, for that.
[120:20.95]Got an Xbox.
[120:22.48]I got multiple Xboxes.
[120:24.58]Get it!
[120:29.92]I'm getting lost.
[120:34.65]I gotta get most of these.
[120:45.79]Should I go back to the Red Ring Room?
[120:46.99]It's too late.
[121:02.78]The Xbox 360... I mean, the hardware was dogshit.
[121:07.79]But it was a... it was a good console.
[121:22.58]You must be freezing from rolling all the icy bits.
[121:24.86]I mean, I just got Xboxes.
[121:28.56]It was cold?
[121:29.04]That's weird.
[121:42.05]I wonder what I would actually say is the worst console of the last three generations.
[121:49.64]I count this one.
[121:50.80]So, like, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox.
[121:56.54]It's probably the Wii U. Yeah.
[121:58.22]The Wii U was terrible.
[122:09.73]It's funny because immediately after that, they have one of the best consoles they've ever made.
[122:18.14]The Switch is awesome.
[122:25.38]Saturn!
[122:25.96]I don't even know the Ouya.
[122:39.58]The Ouya does not even count.
[122:40.96]I don't... It doesn't... No, that's not... I think you only count as a console in a generation if more than 200 people owned you.
[123:02.18]Guys, I could probably make a box that played like one shitty game and it would probably have more people that owned it than there really is.
[123:22.52]I remember seeing them on shelves and it was like dust was on top of them.
[123:27.26]Because none of them had been taken.
[123:29.24]You could run your finger across the top of the 25 they had stacked.
[123:39.03]This is a stylish city.
[123:43.25]Lots of pretty people here.
[123:44.29]Lots to see and do.
[123:46.85]This Katamari has a special rule.
[123:48.81]Go collect lots of ring-shaped stuff.
[123:53.05]You have this much time to collect lots of rings.
[123:57.88]Bicycle wheels, car wheels.
[124:01.06]Okay.
[124:05.45]How many do I need?
[124:09.33]It's not about size, but don't be tiny.
[124:11.33]That's a ring?
[124:26.07]Anatomy?
[124:33.66]Tires.
[124:34.22]Skateboards.
[124:35.32]54 rings.
[124:36.46]Tower, please.
[124:38.76]You guys like this one?
[124:56.95]Donut?
[124:57.57]Score?
[124:58.19]Oh, it's Banban.
[125:00.55]We asked you to put a Posey on.
[125:02.47]Oh, that's a new character.
[125:03.55]I like that one.
[125:04.53]Take a bike.
[125:06.41]There's people around.
[125:10.39]Where am I going?
[125:28.58]Can I get the cards?
[125:36.98]Yes.
[125:41.51]I'm vibing with this one.
[125:47.21]I just need to pick up all those people.
[126:01.37]That counts, dropping cards.
[126:02.45]What does that mean, vibing?
[126:06.28]I see it all the time.
[126:09.64]At least day after day.
[126:27.73]Fun fact, this track is written by Avril Lavigne.
[126:32.25]Strange things in life I mean like I like I didn't like my like I like I didn't like You know I want to do
[127:02.38]Does a thing exist... ...to keep your vocabulary up?
[127:09.74]You know those things like brain games, brain age, right?
[127:12.70]Is there one where I can do vocabulary?
[127:16.78]I need to have my vocabulary checked out.
[127:21.46]I'm talking about a little game I can play in bed.
[127:31.54]It has to be a game I can play on my iPad, or I refuse to download it.
[127:41.95]A book.
[127:43.59]No, no, no, not a book.
[127:44.85]I don't want a story.
[127:47.61]I want a game that I can play that gives me a word.
[127:51.36]For instance, let's say the word is...
[127:55.65]Fast.
[127:56.87]And it has, like, five other words that mean fast.
[127:59.33]And you have to guess, you have to say which one is the right one, and it, like, tells you if you're correct.
[128:09.36]Crossword?
[128:09.98]No, no, crossword... A thesaurus.
[128:15.76]Yes, but a thesaurus game.
[128:18.02]How do we gamify this?
[128:32.08]Download a Kindle from Best Buy for $50.
[128:34.03]The cool app you boomer call police.
[128:42.65]Alright, let me pay attention.
[128:43.67]I can go.
[128:46.31]I need a thousand rings.
[128:49.24]Or I'm going to quit live streaming.
[128:51.36]I'll go on camera, and I'll say, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last one.
[128:57.48]Thanks for everything.
[129:06.93]He's doing it!
[129:09.63]Where are all the rings?
[129:35.37]Just a bunch of like dead animals like no, okay.
[129:38.10]I gotta do this These circles, these aren't rings Guys Guys this is bad
[130:05.39]How will anybody ever trust a single thing I say ever again?
[130:21.00]Oh no, his career is over!
[130:23.36]HIS CAREER IS OVER!
[130:30.76]His career is actually over.
[130:38.66]What did I say?
[130:39.25]800?
[130:39.27]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[130:44.59]What did I say? 800?
[131:34.48]It's okay, within five.
[131:36.95]If you're within five, that means you did it.
[131:40.09]If you're within five miles per hour for the speed limit, you know, if the speed limit's 30 and you go like 31 or 28, 32, you're fine.
[131:44.76]You round it up.
[132:02.72]Guys, I say that like five times a month.
[132:06.90]No, I don't.
[132:07.32]Not that much.
[132:08.56]I say that like three times a year.
[132:10.37]I say that a lot.
[132:19.69]I've believed in you from the beginning.
[132:21.11]Hey, it's been really good.
[132:24.53]You've done that four times this stream.
[132:29.61]You know, you're right.
[132:32.14]I can't keep getting away with that.
[132:41.84]How could I ever trust him again?
[132:43.08]I know!
[132:43.89]Seriously, you can't trust me anymore.
[132:46.61]I'm definitely going to be the donut person.
[132:56.59]Make a montage of every time I've lied.
[132:58.11]I've actually asked for that.
[133:02.04]That would take a long time, though.
[133:04.39]Not because I lie all the time, but because just think about the amount of time you need to go through and find every time that I lied in at least the last five years.
[133:16.08]That's probably hundreds of times.
[133:17.16]This is not possible.
[133:31.17]The video would be hours long.
[133:37.15]That video would be so long that I would have to just play that video and mute my microphone and just sit there silently.
[133:42.54]Alright, I want to be the donut.
[133:50.24]Come here.
[133:52.96]Alright, I'm going to be Banban.
[133:59.74]with the camera on, yep.
[134:00.88]Just shaking my head.
[134:03.68]Is the game audio too loud?
[134:07.48]I'm sorry.
[134:09.68]Yep.
[134:16.12]I want the horn.
[134:19.08]And a backpack.
[134:31.18]Alright, we'll do, uh, we'll do one more.
[134:33.34]And we'll finish it up tomorrow.
[134:40.36]Shit, we're on this trend the last couple streams of beating a game, getting halfway through another one, and needing to start at the next stream, beating that game, starting something else.
[134:52.78]Wait, I want to do another one.
[134:59.93]Did I miss one?
[135:05.37]Always half a game behind, dude.
[135:07.03]Is there a new one?
[135:09.12]I don't see anything new.
[135:13.38]Did I miss one?
[135:17.48]When am I going to do NGU idle?
[135:18.94]You're going to have to fight through a sea of people who will do anything it takes to not see that on stream again.
[135:27.14]So... I don't... What am I going to do about that?
[135:31.55]Roll up energy to make the sun.
[135:33.25]Actually, this is a good one to stop on, I think.
[135:35.63]Dinaville.
[135:38.25]Dinaville.
[135:53.59]No, I can't do NGU anymore.
[135:56.55]The game is cool.
[135:58.75]I love those little games like that.
[136:00.03]They're not stressful.
[136:06.69]They're just... They're just there.
[136:12.59]Oh, also...
[136:14.44]I know that the feature sucks, and it's a stupid, shitty feature right now.
[136:20.37]But... I was thinking about just putting on a random TV show to watch with the Amazon Watch Party when it comes out.
[136:33.95]Those of you that don't know... You can't talk... I just have to type in chat.
[136:43.65]This thing has to be huge, by the way.
[136:49.41]That's... enormous.
[136:50.43]I have ten minutes to do this?
[136:58.46]I wanna do my own Amazon watch party, where I go get royalty-free old movies and we just watch one.
[137:05.00]Stuff that's just in public domain.
[137:06.74]That doesn't even matter.
[137:15.15]Can you do that?
[137:17.23]Can I just watch like a shitty public domain movie from like the 30s?
[137:30.94]That would either be a really funny, fun stream or a terrible stream.
[137:42.20]It would be both.
[137:43.70]Maybe we'll try it.
[137:44.88]What do you got?
[137:45.36]Alright, what do you got?
[137:49.42]The problem is, here's my problem.
[137:51.52]You gotta commit to that.
[137:53.90]Because if halfway, if like, if after like 20 minutes of that movie, I'm just like, I, this sucks.
[137:59.74]I don't want to do this anymore.
[138:01.83]You can't, I can't leave.
[138:09.70]What am I gonna pause- cut the movie off after like 45 minutes?
[138:19.47]If it sucks just play Fortnite on your phone or something
[138:36.66]Something about watching a kind of current TV show, though.
[138:42.94]It actually might be kind of fun to just sit and chat.
[138:45.26]And just be one of you, you know what I mean?
[138:47.34]Just experience it with you guys.
[138:59.69]We'll have to see.
[139:01.01]How does it work?
[139:02.72]I don't think I'm gonna have access to it It's like a beta right now, right?
[139:19.87]Just recreate a public domain movie, uh, that would take a lot of work
[139:30.75]Can we do that right now?
[139:32.23]I don't think I have access to it.
[139:33.31]It's like a beta right now.
[139:35.23]I could probably request access to it.
[139:39.10]But I really wish I could at least talk over the movie.
[139:46.16]Okay, I understand that... I understand that, oh, it's like a thing with copyright and they don't want to have the movie be shown or replicated again with... Why does that matter?
[140:00.95]You guys ever watched a movie with your mother?
[140:02.35]My mother talks over every movie.
[140:08.96]Why is that bad?
[140:09.66]What, do you think people don't talk during movies?
[140:16.10]When you go to the movie in the movie theater, there's somebody talking.
[140:18.00]They're like having a full-on conversation.
[140:22.10]What's the difference?
[140:27.37]I mean, the facecam thing, maybe.
[140:29.13]Alright, okay, so because you're... You're, like, not in the movie.
[140:32.15]You're not supposed to be part of the movie.
[140:34.91]It's licensed out.
[140:35.67]It's the movie.
[140:36.27]You're not in it.
[140:37.21]But just talking?
[140:38.11]You can't even talk over the movie.
[140:53.70]No.
[140:54.94]From my understanding, you cannot talk...
[140:58.29]Like, there's no microphone and you can't be on camera.
[141:14.60]And whoever is viewing needs to have Amazon Prime.
[141:16.80]Yeah, that's true.
[141:23.49]Just broadcast the show to your channel.
[141:26.07]Or the movie.
[141:26.89]I mean, isn't that the quickest way for me to get my channel suspended?
[141:30.17]What do we need, like 500 meters?
[141:38.60]Can I get houses yet?
[141:46.44]Kind of.
[141:56.53]Alright, get it.
[141:57.25]If they ban you, just ban them back.
[142:05.30]Uh... That didn't work.
[142:09.12]Alright, I only have like four more minutes to do this.
[142:17.15]I'm not going up there yet.
[142:22.91]I need to get all this shit first.
[142:35.36]You're gonna get banned.
[142:36.74]And then... Imagine that.
[142:40.64]Oh, why'd you get banned?
[142:42.66]Uh... Well... I streamed the Nutty Professor to my chat.
[142:49.42]And we hung out and watched it.
[142:50.92]And now I can't stream ever again.
[142:59.07]It's too bad.
[143:00.27]It was fun, though.
[143:12.79]Straight ahead.
[143:14.03]Super fast motion.
[143:24.56]The copyrights only last 75 years.
[143:26.82]Yeah, ain't Mickey Mouse gonna be up for a copyright soon?
[143:33.69]That's gonna be really, really crazy.
[143:38.01]Imagine your local car dealership
[143:41.12]Having Mickey Mouse in the commercial and the guy that owns the dealership is doing the voice You're gonna have to deal with that Oh, come on down to Paul's Paul's Emporium of all land vehicles Oh, yes, it's me, Mickey Mouse Come on down and save 20% on your first purchase That's gonna be horrendous
[144:10.84]Oh, welcome to Michael's Furniture Store!
[144:13.50]Oh, it's me, Mickey Mouse!
[144:14.65]Thanks for joining us, and if you come in by a sectional... You guys ready for that?
[144:24.91]I don't think you are.
[144:31.91]Oh, jeez, Rick!
[144:35.97]And some of them aren't even gonna give a shit.
[144:37.52]They're not even gonna try.
[144:39.99]Mickey Mouse will be on screen.
[144:42.30]Animated.
[144:46.50]That's right.
[144:48.40]With two purchases, you get the third one for free.
[145:02.93]Tell him Bob sent you.
[145:06.57]Alright, I need to get to 500 meters.
[145:07.57]I'm going to lose it.
[145:22.64]It's gonna be a 15 second pause.
[145:33.70]There might be.
[145:36.58]This is some cool shit though.
[145:38.35]Too bad we're not gonna be able to see very much of it.
[145:50.41]It's still kind of possible.
[146:06.69]Fuck is going on in my chair Come on I spent too much time talking about Mickey Mouse
[146:44.13]230, 220, 230.
[146:44.41]Halfway there.
[146:45.43]I fucking lost.
[146:46.39]I swear.
[147:16.07]Didn't even make it halfway, yeah.
[147:17.57]How the fuck did I do that?
[147:21.99]This is Matthew from the other streaming platform team.
[147:24.63]We're reaching out to you for a Rat Pack.
[147:27.55]Reaching out to your Rat Pack with fans.
[147:33.49]I can't even read this.

[147:44.20]Free present.
[147:46.50]Am I not big enough to get this?
[147:47.46]This is terrible.
[147:53.18]Bad RNG.
[147:53.48]What a bad place to start.
[147:59.68]Backpack.
[148:03.18]Imagine changing platforms for a backpack.
[148:08.34]I'll tell you that thing better be made out of gold.
[148:27.62]Imagine selling backpacks.
[148:28.69]That's not a bad idea.
[148:30.99]Did you guys buy a backpack?
[148:42.76]No, by the way, they're $79.99.
[148:43.52]I have to do this right.

[153:51.07]Now we're...
[153:57.04]Really?
[153:57.38]I can't get any of those?
[153:58.62]What?
[154:13.03]500.
[154:13.19]Alright.
[154:15.51]Start picking up everything.
[154:18.25]If you listen carefully, you can hear him scream.
[154:21.05]Oh, you can hear it does scream.
[154:22.32]I see.
[154:23.04]Okay.
[154:54.24]Am I big enough to stop bringing up islands?
[155:01.36]I'll be there in a second.
[155:05.05]Alright, islands!
[155:31.76]Look at the mountain!
[155:45.07]Oh!
[155:45.15]This way.
[155:52.77]Dinosaurs.
[155:55.71]Here... 250.
[155:56.43]I'm not even fucking close.
[156:13.30]What are you doing?
[156:17.46]Maybe a 300?
[156:17.86]This will start to... Alright, not all the islands.
[156:24.36]It starts to pick up most things now.
[156:25.79]Just move.
[156:28.87]Oh, that lag.
[156:36.09]It's so hard to turn it.
[156:38.69]Oh, man.
[156:39.27]I can't even control it.
[156:42.13]Oh.
[156:43.29]No, I don't want to be this way.
[156:48.27]Why would you move?
[156:59.98]No.
[157:10.43]I'm just moving.
[157:13.46]Get to 1,000.
[157:17.46]Get the giant dragon.
[157:19.45]Dragon.
[157:20.35]No.
[157:23.79]If I don't get to 1,000, I will quit streaming.
[157:26.63]Here's your new 1,000.
[157:52.16]Cool.
[158:00.97]Career saved it again.
[158:05.35]C-A-R-E-O-M-E-G-A-L-O No, there's no O. It's not career or.
[158:22.68]I'm kidding.
[158:23.30]I know how to spell career.
[158:24.74]I'm not like from the fourth grade Energy
[158:50.98]present.
[158:51.50]Pancakes.
[158:51.92]Sandwiches.
[158:52.88]And another cousin.
[158:53.90]Another cousin.
[158:54.82]Peso.
[159:20.43]The sun.
[159:29.51]That's a new one, though, for a lot of people.
[159:31.46]Are you pretending to be bad for a documentary?
[159:37.90]Cool.
[159:40.72]Alright.
[159:43.20]I think it's a good time to call it.
[159:45.89]Just under the seven-hour mark.
[159:47.29]We will... I'll ride the train.
[159:54.30]We'll see you tomorrow.
[159:56.62]I'll finish this tomorrow.
[159:58.90]We'll do the DLC levels.
[160:01.66]And then, I don't know, fucking Mystery Stream.
[160:03.90]We'll find out tomorrow.
[160:15.93]The Nutty Professor.
[160:19.95]We're not going to be watching The Nutty Professor, unfortunately.
[160:29.44]Thanks for coming out, guys.
[160:30.16]See you tomorrow.
[160:33.00]Let us go to bits.
[160:34.68]And hopefully the sub credits thing is fixed.
[160:37.84]It was screwed up before.
[160:38.56]Remember the credits from last time?
[160:43.97]It just didn't get pulled through.
[160:46.25]Maybe they fixed it.
[160:46.89]We'll find out.
[160:57.30]Alright.
[161:02.90]Let's go over here.
[161:04.30]Might as well check it.
[161:14.09]Nope.
[161:17.01]It was worth a check.
[161:17.89]Jerma verb noun.
[161:22.83]Jerma verb noun.
[161:27.61]Immortalized in the bits.
[161:29.97]And the insane gifted subs, yeah?
[161:32.30]Pretty much.
[161:34.60]But!
[161:37.10]Special thanks to DarkSoul, thanks to the 250.
[161:44.00]They say.
[161:44.40]Get well soon.
[161:56.94]Yeah, I'm gonna have... I'm gonna know, I think, what's going on soon here.
[162:04.74]It's been a real pain in the ass, but, you know, do what you gotta do.
[162:09.20]We'll see.
[162:11.96]But, thank you, Dark Soul.
[162:12.86]Appreciate that.
[162:15.29]For real, though, thanks for the $2.50.
[162:16.61]Jerma, have you ever considered to do a one-off stream of a Paradox game like Stellaris?
[162:21.25]I know they can be hard to fully grasp, but I think they'd be some good RP and bit opportunities.
[162:27.86]Probably not.
[162:30.24]Games like that, they sort of, they require, correct me if I'm wrong, don't they require a pretty large time commitment before you can really get into the game and care about it?
[162:41.87]And you all know me when it comes to reading.
[162:51.05]I get distracted and I lose interest really quickly with stuff like that.
[162:56.33]Not just on stream, just in general, too.
[163:02.85]No books.
[163:08.65]I'm more of a run-zombie-over-with-car kind of guy, you know?
[163:20.96]He's our illiterate streamer.
[163:28.34]That was a pretty good time of rumor.
[163:31.15]Yeah.
[163:32.89]But, no, probably not.
[163:35.49]The last time I played, I mean, Mountain Blade is one of those games that you have to kind of sit down and actually care about and play and learn and there's a learning curve to it.
[163:45.98]And that kind of didn't turn out.
[163:47.30]That was alright.
[163:47.94]It was fun.
[163:49.14]For a while.
[163:52.92]It gets good 500 hours in.
[163:57.46]I'm sure it is.
[164:00.05]Just not really for me.
[164:06.63]But thanks.
[164:07.39]Thank you, Doc, for the... Whoa!
[164:09.21]Almost just read one under the threshold.
[164:11.31]That's my bad.
[164:12.31]If you don't know, there's a threshold on the channel.
[164:18.61]Anything above 250 bits is the ones that are red.
[164:23.64]And I fucked it up right there.
[164:33.74]I'm going to let this one slide, though.
[164:36.26]This is from WeRan, or WhyRan.
[164:39.16]Thanks for the 249 bits.
[164:42.80]But, hold on.
[164:44.92]I'm a dummy, and I used one bit to talk in sub-mode chat.
[164:51.22]So... That's our... Okay.
[164:54.94]Whatever.
[164:55.72]That's, like, funny to me, so I'm going to read this.
[165:00.01]Anyways, any plans of playing the MCC Halo games or any other rhythm games?
[165:05.11]I have Busta Groove.
[165:07.14]That's kind of waiting in the wings for some random day.
[165:15.99]But Halo...
[165:18.48]We're gonna have to... We will enjoy the Halo games together.
[165:23.52]I have never played a Halo game.
[165:27.29]I have only played Halo 2 multiplayer.
[165:31.97]Just sitting in a room with some friends.
[165:33.37]I have never played Halo 1's campaign.
[165:36.48]Never played Halo 2.
[165:37.44]Never played Halo... I have never played them.
[165:43.94]So, I have the string of that series.
[165:49.63]Whenever I feel like doing it.
[165:54.93]We'll see.
[165:58.89]I'm looking forward to it.
[166:00.93]Thank you, MGS fan, for the $30.
[166:03.59]3,000 bits, no message.
[166:04.71]That's a lot of money.
[166:09.21]Thank you, MGS fan.
[166:13.47]Appreciate it.
[166:15.95]Uh... Wait, where is it?
[166:16.55]No link.
[166:16.89]We don't have a link here.
[166:18.75]How long is it?
[166:46.09]It's 26 minutes long?!
[166:47.41]This is a full episode of TV!
[166:54.24]We're gonna have to set like a whole day to watch this one.
[167:02.54]It's like 30 minutes.
[167:06.76]Well, there's your TV show.
[167:08.02]Maybe we'll watch that.
[167:10.00]Not right now.
[167:14.18]I thought you meant he made, like, a little... Alright, then.
[167:15.96]I have to check.
[167:17.36]I wonder how... Those of you that... Anybody watch... Anybody watch his 3D Movie Maker streams?
[167:26.72]Did he have fun playing in a 800x600 window in the middle of his desktop?
[167:39.63]Took him 60 hours to make it.
[167:42.19]Yeah, my game takes time.
[167:48.07]Halfway through his files.
[167:49.17]Yeah, you have to mod it.
[167:50.07]Otherwise, it's unbearable.
[167:54.54]I'm not even sure you can play it without the new tools.
[167:59.20]It's been a long time since I've really gone in there and played with it.
[168:01.74]We're talking about 3D Movie Maker.
[168:08.85]Maybe we'll watch it one day.
[168:10.41]We'll have to watch it in chunks.
[168:20.88]It's legendary.
[168:25.24]Yeah, Rat Movie 2 took, like, three weeks to make.
[168:28.56]And it was, like, nine minutes.
[168:32.07]It was, like, at least two or three weeks.
[168:34.13]To, like, sit down and do it for a few hours.
[168:35.91]And to get away from it, sit down for, like, three or four hours.
[168:38.43]Took a long fucking time.
[168:39.51]That program is not meant to make stuff like that.
[168:44.11]So, I can imagine a 30-minute short movie...
[168:50.66]It had to have taken, like, months of actually sitting down and, like, sitting working on it.
[169:03.91]But that's really cool.
[169:06.33]I knew that they were... I knew he was doing it.
[169:09.45]I knew he was doing 3D Moon Maker at one point, but I'm glad other people know that that exists and use it.
[169:18.22]Because it's an untapped gold mine.
[169:22.69]It's good to see people playing with it.
[169:27.01]But, that was from... Oh, that was the... That was just a chat.
[169:33.93]That wasn't even a bit message.
[169:36.19]No, yes it was.
[169:36.65]It was Hydra.
[169:37.17]Hydra, 500 bits.
[169:38.09]Thank you, Hydra725.
[169:41.78]DinoPulse, thanks for the 500 bits.
[169:43.30]Just the thought I'd ask, what's your experience been with Street Fighter?
[169:47.81]Accidentally putting 50 cents into the machine in the arcade.
[169:51.96]Losing so badly that I'd never play it ever again.
[169:59.36]I don't... I don't do fighting games.
[170:03.81]You know when I just get really angry when a zombie grabs me in...
[170:08.75]Dead Rising.
[170:10.53]That's the feeling that I feel every time somebody gets a combo off on me.
[170:14.46]It's like, God fucking damn it.
[170:16.52]No.
[170:16.82]It's stupid.
[170:18.16]No.
[170:19.62]Game is fucking not even... That happens every match.
[170:31.14]Stupid fucking idiot.
[170:32.14]Fucking dumb fucking idiot.
[170:36.24]Those games can be kind of fun.
[170:39.23]When you just have a few drinks and you just act like a dickhead with some of your friends.
[170:44.06]But you always end up with the one friend that actually knows how to do everything.
[170:47.94]And nobody wants to play against them.
[170:53.96]Because you got a room full of four or five people.
[170:57.58]Four of you have no idea what you're doing.
[170:59.56]You've learned one move and trying one small combo.
[171:03.09]And this other dude can do like a 40 hit combo with smoke.
[171:09.07]By the way, I'm talking about me.
[171:10.23]That was me.
[171:14.56]Mortal Kombat 3.
[171:16.26]I decimated with smoke.
[171:19.04]Cyborg smoke.
[171:24.48]That's the one.
[171:31.03]I love being the guy that knows this stuff.
[171:33.09]It's actually kind of fun because you can tell everybody.
[171:35.87]to do and then they look at their controller and they look at their hands and they slowly do the move you just told them to do they did it so wrong that you're just mad in the chat because the streamer didn't go the way that you told them to and you just can't believe that they would miss the thing that they missed and then you you watch as they crumble
[172:04.23]We struck a nerve.
[172:06.23]I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
[172:07.25]Street Fighter?
[172:10.21]I respect those games, but I can't play them.
[172:19.64]You ever play Divekick?
[172:21.28]Yeah, but that's just me and Star just dicking around.
[172:28.52]I respect them, I can't play them.
[172:29.66]They're fun to watch.
[172:34.46]Uh, Viction Iscius, thanks for the 300 bits.
[172:37.31]After this, can you do a Simpsons hit and run speedrun?
[172:42.29]I will probably never play that game again.
[172:45.33]It's in the vault.
[172:45.93]I've closed the door.
[172:47.69]I... I put Simpsons hit and run in the bank vault.
[172:53.01]I closed it, spun the thing, and then when it said, please create a password, I just smushed my fucking hand all over the keypad.
[173:00.57]I don't even know what the password is.
[173:02.16]Don't ever let me open that door.
[173:11.55]But thank you for the 300 bits.
[173:16.03]Maybe I'm just a lunatic.
[173:16.71]Thanks for the streams.
[173:43.67]Because Providence is in Rhode Island and it's really close.
[173:52.14]It's just a state away.
[173:53.10]It's just like another state for them to say... You know when you go and watch a movie and they say the name of your city?
[174:00.50]That's why.
[174:04.18]And you sit in the chair and you're like, ooh!
[174:06.02]And you look back to the people that are with you and you're like, they said the name of the city that we live in.
[174:12.34]Did you hear?
[174:12.74]You guys heard that?
[174:13.46]All of us heard that.
[174:14.82]Cool.
[174:16.09]Cool.
[174:16.33]They said the name of a town.
[174:22.55]Guys, I do that now even with Vegas.
[174:27.11]Anytime I... Oh, yeah.
[174:28.41]Give him a call.
[174:30.46]Yeah, he's down in Vegas.
[174:33.90]That's me.
[174:35.22]That's where I live.
[174:40.73]I just watched the Hangover movie, and I'm constantly going, oh, fuck, I know what that is.
[174:47.60]Hold on, where's that camera pin?
[174:49.36]I, yep, yep, I've been there.
[174:50.38]I've been there.
[174:50.74]I stood there.
[174:51.94]Cool.
[174:52.56]Ooh, you guys see this?
[174:57.89]I do that with my city.
[174:58.65]Yeah, everybody does.
[175:03.68]I don't know why.
[175:04.38]I guess it's just cool to see it in, like, 35mm film.
[175:07.60]It's all digital now.
[175:09.16]Jerma lied about 35mm being films.
[175:19.18]It's still cool, though.
[175:21.50]But, um... I'm not sure if being around Boston is what shaped it.
[175:29.39]I just watched a lot of cartoons and a lot of TV...
[175:33.96]I was just a huge fan of just weird cartoons.
[175:36.30]I was a huge Jim Carrey fan.
[175:42.69]They're just animated, fun, interesting people.
[175:52.25]What were the weird cartoons?
[175:53.29]Ren and Stimpy.
[175:54.11]Pretty much anything on Nickelodeon from 1992 to 1996.
[175:56.81]Thoughts on Jim Carrey in the Sonic movie?
[176:05.35]Um, I don't, I don't know.
[176:06.53]I've just seen, like, trailer.
[176:09.61]He's getting older, too.
[176:10.41]You know, he's, he's like, he's, he's like almost, what, he's 60?
[176:15.80]He's old.
[176:16.62]He's getting older.
[176:21.82]Yeah, he's pretty old.
[176:22.58]Let's see, how old is Jim Carrey?
[176:27.35]Jim Carrey is... He's 57.
[176:37.88]I mean, he's still doing what he's still able to do, right?
[176:45.92]But yeah, just a lot of Saturday morning cartoon stuff, a lot of Nicktoon stuff.
[176:52.29]There are others that I could definitely think of that have just shaped the way that I think things are funny or interesting.
[177:01.73]I could probably rifle off a bunch if I sat here and thought about it.
[177:10.26]But, yeah, there you go.
[177:13.36]Thanks for the message.
[177:15.32]Thank you, Lights Noton, for the $2.50.
[177:18.66]Hey, Jerma, love the Dead Rising streams.
[177:21.00]I really commend you on the all-in-one-go approach.
[177:24.10]Keep up the great work.
[177:24.96]You're a treasure.
[177:25.92]Turn cam on.
[177:29.38]Turn the streams over.
[177:30.40]Turn cam on.
[177:30.92]Don't work.
[177:31.96]Yeah, I told you.
[177:32.48]I get the Boy Scout badge that says I did it in one go.
[177:38.01]You may have restarted.
[177:39.05]I didn't.
[177:39.92]I get that.
[177:40.40]The stapler comes over and just onto my chest.
[177:48.22]It says you did Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 true endings in one go without restarting the game.
[177:54.46]And it hurts a lot.
[177:59.24]And then I turned to you.
[177:59.90]And you're sitting there behind me.
[178:00.98]You're about to get your badge.
[178:02.04]But your badge is not that.
[178:03.10]I turned to you and I just go.
[178:04.82]I stick my tongue out.
[178:07.84]quick enough where the adults don't see me do it.
[178:10.58]Can I turn back?
[178:14.82]Oh yeah, thank you.
[178:26.59]There's that Nicktoons influence.
[178:33.66]Dexter's Lab, yeah, that was the same kind of era.
[178:36.72]Early 2000s, late 90s.
[178:38.46]I know it's so easy to be like, ooh, 90s.
[178:42.78]Another 90s kid, oh, 90s.
[178:46.52]But there were some really great, great cartoons and pieces of media and actors and comedians.
[178:52.81]It was awesome.
[179:00.56]So many incredible shows and we're just airing during that period.
[179:11.06]I know everybody looks fondly down on when they grew up when they were a kid and everything and I don't know some of you guys that might be a decade younger than me right now in this chat probably have those same fond memories of something.
[179:23.59]I'm trying to think of something that was like Minecraft.
[179:30.50]Think about that for a second, right?
[179:32.63]Imagine if you, imagine if you were like 12, 13, 14, when Minecraft released.
[179:42.23]That's kind of a, that's a huge thing.
[179:44.74]That was a really, really cool thing.
[179:47.12]If you were younger, imagine 10 years go by and you look back on everything.
[179:52.84]That's me talking about running Stimpy.
[179:58.88]So, everybody looks fondly back on the cool shit that they had.
[180:10.53]I was in my 20s, in my late 20s, and I thought that Minecraft was... That first alpha...
[180:19.50]I remember specifically saying, holy shit, if I was a kid right now, if I was 10, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old, that would have been what me, this multiplayer, you can build your own communities and houses and go on adventures with your friends.
[180:41.68]I cannot even possibly imagine what it was like for some of you guys to be able to do that when it came out.
[180:52.74]And you tried to cash in with grandpa.
[181:02.27]I used to carry a copy of Minecraft on a USB stick so I could play it at school.
[181:07.47]That's so ridiculous.
[181:12.48]But then you think about what's the new thing?
[181:14.44]What's everybody going to get into now?
[181:18.25]If you look back fondly on how awesome Minecraft was for the years that you played it when you were a kid... What is that now?
[181:26.63]Is it Fortnite?
[181:27.85]Is it?
[181:29.41]I don't think it is.
[181:30.27]You know why?
[181:30.81]Because Fortnite is a battle royale game.
[181:36.39]Fortnite is not... They're not Minecraft.
[181:44.47]It's really, really popular.
[181:46.94]But if Fortnite is the Minecraft for the kids right now, and is the Ren and Stimpy for me, I'm not so sure I like that.
[182:02.83]It's just a BR.
[182:03.79]It's not...
[182:09.08]Need to wait a few more years.
[182:10.12]I wonder what the next big thing will be.
[182:12.98]Once BRs are done and gone.
[182:15.73]It was MOBAs for a little while.
[182:17.85]What's it going to be next?
[182:21.17]Maybe the next iteration of VR might actually do it.
[182:26.41]Because imagine you picking up a VR headset that's like a Vive 3 or whatever the hell it would be.
[182:34.92]And you put it on, you're like, holy shit, this is insane.
[182:37.12]This is way better than the original Vive.
[182:38.62]This is, like, genre-defining.
[182:40.82]And there's, like, a 12- to 13-year-old that's putting it on for the first time.
[182:46.83]We'll see.
[182:53.17]Let's wait for Minecraft 2.
[182:54.27]Didn't it already come out?
[182:55.91]It's Minecraft in real life, right?
[182:57.65]I actually was gonna download it.
[182:59.89]I couldn't.
[183:00.49]All of my devices aren't good enough.
[183:04.76]I tried.
[183:07.96]Yeah, Minecraft Earth.
[183:11.41]My iPad's not good enough and my iPhone.
[183:13.81]They're both not good enough to run the game.
[183:16.55]I can't even download it.
[183:17.69]It won't let me.
[183:21.55]I was a little disappointed.
[183:27.66]Yeah, I have an iPhone 6.
[183:30.66]I want...
[183:32.76]You ready for me to explode right now?
[183:35.42]Have I ever talked about this?
[183:36.50]It's the end of the stream, who cares?
[183:39.30]Have I talked about the iPhone SE?
[183:44.80]You ever heard me go off on that before?
[183:46.52]I don't think so.
[183:49.04]No.
[183:49.74]This is fresh.
[183:52.82]Why... Is the only phone... That's not a gigantic brick...
[184:01.90]not only discontinued but they're never gonna make one ever again that iPhone 4 case the iPhone se was this iPhone special edition it was small it was that iPhone 4 chassis small enough to fit in your hand easy to go in your pocket and they deleted them they discontinued the se why
[184:28.69]And apparently the rumors are that the SE2 is gonna be as big as a regular iPhone.
[184:36.09]Nobody make, they're all huge, nobody makes a phone anymore that's a 4 to 6 inch screen.
[184:43.01]That iPhone 4 size, everyone's just making huge ass phones.
[184:49.42]Nobody, nobody is making a fucking phone that is a
[184:54.53]I'm gonna say it, but you know... I'm gonna say it.
[184:58.11]Compact.
[184:59.41]It's a compact phone.
[185:03.43]I don't want a huge phone.
[185:04.95]I want a small phone that I can easily get in my pocket and get out and put... I don't like these big phones.
[185:11.29]And the SE was perfect.
[185:13.89]I am not kidding.
[185:15.49]Kim can literally corroborate this story.
[185:18.45]I was going to get an SE...
[185:22.11]And they discontinued it two days before I went in to go buy one.
[185:28.63]We actually went into the iPhone store.
[185:31.19]And I was like, oh, let me get an SE.
[185:33.33]Oh, we don't have those anymore.
[185:35.21]And it was because I got on stage once every fucking seven months and goes, hey, we're putting out new phones now that are all $1,500 each.
[185:46.19]And we're deleting the last generation.
[185:53.11]Why do they have to delete... What is this, Hearthstone?
[185:56.07]Why do they have to go back two generations and delete them?
[186:06.01]That's not in our standard decks anymore.
[186:08.96]The SE was so different that I don't know why they didn't keep him around.
[186:11.26]And everybody loves him.
[186:12.44]It's not like I'm some weirdo that's making a big stink about the SE.
[186:16.66]If you type in, like, SE, new SE, please, God, new SE, you get threads.
[186:21.31]People fucking want it so bad.
[186:26.09]But no, please scan my face.
[186:28.79]With the fucking 17-inch screen on my phone.
[186:34.06]I want my camera to be as good as like a film camera.
[186:38.04]I don't give a shit.
[186:43.86]I want to be able to take my phone out of my pocket and it's so huge and heavy and it makes a loud noise and I drop it on my desk so everybody has to hear it and look over here.
[186:52.48]And they see my cool case.
[187:00.99]If you can kill somebody with your phone, it's too big.
[187:07.27]Just saying.
[187:15.04]I don't know why they don't make them anymore.
[187:16.78]And I looked up other companies too.
[187:19.50]There's the Razer, right?
[187:24.30]The Motorola Razer.
[187:27.04]There's a new Razer coming out.
[187:28.14]It folds.
[187:29.24]It's a foldable phone.
[187:30.18]Well, that's really cool.
[187:32.92]What did you say?
[187:33.42]What did you say about that?
[187:34.94]You said that it was more than $1,500, $1,600 for that phone.
[187:36.82]Oh.
[187:36.88]Okay.
[187:37.04]Okay.
[187:49.93]The iPhone SE was like 300 bucks.
[187:54.69]I don't want a like $1,700 phone.
[188:02.67]But it folds.
[188:05.51]Is that worth 1,500 bucks?
[188:13.50]Sooner or later, you're gonna have to stop financing your phone like a car.
[188:20.33]No, I got, yeah, I got a great interest rate on my phone.
[188:23.49]How much was it?
[188:24.09]Oh, it was 8,100 bucks.
[188:26.29]But I'm financing it over 40 years.
[188:29.09]Yeah, I have a 12% annual interest rate on it.
[188:32.25]It's pretty good, pretty good.
[188:33.23]It would have been 15.
[188:34.60]Good thing my credit's so good.
[188:35.52]I just want a goddamn telephone that I can text and can play Minecraft Earth.
[188:51.17]You could buy a trash phone for sale, but I don't want a trash phone.
[188:55.87]I don't want a trash phone.
[189:00.05]I want a small screen that has like apps, like small, doesn't have a big processor, long battery.
[189:07.40]I don't want to go into Walmart and buy the $39, like, poo-poo wireless, whatever the hell the things are.
[189:20.61]Like, prepaid $30 phone that is made- it's like a toy.
[189:25.61]It's like a baby phone.
[189:32.52]And you know what sucks even worse?
[189:35.74]Rip the covers off this conversation.
[189:39.22]Rip the covers off.
[189:41.38]You know that they still make the SE,
[189:44.70]But it's for prepaid phones.
[189:47.16]So if you want a SE, you gotta go to get one of these prepaid fucking poo-poo wireless phones.
[189:55.19]And you can't unlock them.
[189:56.65]You can't use them on another carrier.
[190:01.63]Just give me the phone.
[190:03.85]And just unlock it.
[190:13.88]Stop, Jerma.
[190:14.44]Best Buy's filing for bankruptcy.
[190:15.94]Well, give me my phone and maybe we'll see.
[190:18.26]But, like, I'm going to help them?
[190:26.55]And then it has to be for the right carrier?
[190:30.35]Well, that... If you unlock that one... Well, hold on a second here.
[190:33.89]That one only works on the Verizon and AT&T networks.
[190:38.78]That's not going to work on T-Mobile.
[190:40.76]Why?
[190:40.98]Why?
[190:43.44]Because the way that, I don't know.
[190:46.74]I can't tell you either, sir.
[190:51.17]And then you got the people that bought a bunch of SEs.
[190:55.69]They went to, I just wanted an SE.
[191:00.39]They went to the Apple store when they heard about the discontinuation and they bought SEs.
[191:06.16]of them and they keep them in the seal and then they sell them for like 500 600 bucks 700 bucks it's sealed I just want the se should be one per customer in the store but then they buy them all I don't know where they even get these
[191:30.08]Okay, welcome to Apple's store.
[191:31.84]How can I help you, sir?
[191:32.92]I'd like to buy 15 iPhone SEs.
[191:35.90]Sure, right this way.
[191:47.09]They're 200 bucks new on eBay.
[191:48.87]That's a lie.
[191:50.21]Those have like tracking devices in them.
[191:53.63]The person opened it up and like put a bunch of viruses on them and like closed it back up.
[192:03.47]You wouldn't complain if they were buying 15 of your shirts?
[192:08.10]You don't need my shirt to make a phone call.
[192:14.59]And my shirts also aren't $300.
[192:29.23]My carrier is glued.
[192:30.43]Alright, let's get out of here.
[192:31.71]Just so you know.
[192:33.57]Where the fuck is the SE2?
[192:34.89]If the SE2 comes out and it's not a compact phone, I will leave Apple.
[192:43.91]Wait a minute.
[192:44.45]I can't believe it.
[192:45.33]I don't care.
[192:46.07]I don't give a shit what phone I have.
[192:52.65]I know that's like a... Wait a... I'm going to take that seriously.
[192:57.43]Jeremy, your phone is a tracking device.
[193:02.06]Yeah, I know my phone's a tracking device, but it's not... it doesn't have a direct bug... to, like, Larry's apartment.
[193:09.77]The guy that put it on there.
[193:28.27]It's constantly recording.
[193:29.29]How do you think voice activation works?
[193:30.75]I don't have any of that stuff turned on.
[193:32.91]Siri, off.
[193:36.91]Tracking, off.
[193:38.57]They don't know where I am.
[193:49.44]Alright, I...
[193:58.98]I'm just thinking of somebody turning off Siri.
[194:01.86]And then being like, alright, now I can go to Pornhub.
[194:06.40]Siri's off!
[194:23.12]It's the greatest surveillance device that the police state could have wished for.
[194:31.79]Not if you turn off Siri.
[194:37.61]Don't you have to actively go into, like, Windows 10?
[194:39.81]I remember doing this when I first got Windows 10.
[194:41.27]Don't you have to go into Windows 10's settings and just click, like, like, please leave me the fuck alone?
[195:03.75]It's crazy because as much as this is a joke, I don't like being in a room that has an Alexa in it.
[195:11.96]It's almost like I want to talk in a different room.
[195:15.14]It's like, hey man, what'd you do yesterday?
[195:17.32]Well, you know what?
[195:18.84]What, you have an Alexa?
[195:22.23]I mean, nothing I say is going to be bad.
[195:24.95]You're like, can we go in the other room?
[195:26.81]Like, just come up here.
[195:27.61]Like, I'm going to whisper into your ear.
[195:39.12]You should choose your words more carefully.
[195:44.40]This stuff freaks me out.
[195:45.34]I don't like Alexa.
[195:46.53]I don't like Siri.
[195:48.09]I don't like the Google Assistant.
[195:52.79]I don't like them.
[195:53.69]I don't want them.
[196:00.37]I'll tell you the convenience factor for being like... Hey, Alexa.
[196:04.94]Yes?
[196:05.04]Yes?
[196:08.56]Order 10 more cases of ocean spray pineapple juice.
[196:14.02]Okay, it'll be here tomorrow.
[196:15.72]Thank you.
[196:20.33]But I don't, I don't like them.
[196:22.25]They freak me out.
[196:27.71]Stop, Jerma.
[196:29.03]You just ordered that.
[196:35.53]Why are you scared to talk around Alexa when you tell us so much about- too much about your life on stream anyways?
[196:41.17]Yeah, but that's me choosing to tell you.
[196:43.67]If I shit my pants, like I did three days ago, and I was in my bed, and I was like, I just shit my pants, I don't want Alexa to know that.
[197:03.13]I tell my Alexa everything you tell me.
[197:11.83]What, are you playing telephone?
[197:15.10]Oh, I shit my pants yesterday.
[197:16.62]Hey, Alexa.
[197:17.86]Yes, Roger.
[197:18.90]Jerma shit his pants yesterday.
[197:20.28]What is it?
[197:25.40]I don't get it.
[197:33.46]Alright, we gotta get through this.
[197:39.88]No, it's different.
[197:40.85]When I'm in a conversation with somebody, here's the difference.
[197:43.95]I am broadcasting to you right now.
[197:45.97]I am choosing to broadcast to you.
[197:48.43]If I go to dinner with Kim, I am not broadcasting the dinner to you guys.
[197:55.20]I'm not broadcasting the dinner to my mother.
[197:58.30]If I'm sitting at the dinner table and we're having a dinner conversation, that's not me doing a livestream.
[198:04.14]That's me and Kim eating dinner.
[198:05.54]I don't want Alexa to just fucking lean in and listen to me.
[198:12.74]But why not?
[198:15.66]I don't want somebody just like listening to me.
[198:20.72]If somebody opened my front door while I was eating dinner and just sat in a chair and just... That's what they did.
[198:25.78]They just sat there.
[198:28.04]Hey, who the fuck are you?
[198:30.17]My name's Alex.
[198:31.93]Oh, hi, Alex.
[198:35.02]Can I help you?
[198:36.12]Nope.
[198:36.52]I'm just listening to everything you say.
[198:40.44]Okay.
[198:41.40]And like, Kim comes home from work.
[198:43.66]And we just start to, you know, I don't want to have a, Kim, can we go another, this guy is sitting in the corner.
[198:49.96]And he just has his hand put up, cupped around his ear, leaning forward.
[198:53.78]This guy's freaking me out.
[198:55.52]Can we go upstairs and talk?
[199:08.18]He hates Joel's movie.
[199:10.66]What?
[199:12.04]He's writing everything down.
[199:13.89]That's what I'm saying.
[199:14.59]I don't want anyone just to listen to me.
[199:17.75]People have, like, private conversations.
[199:19.49]I don't want, like, some random Alexa sitting there hounding me.
[199:25.11]And you can always tell.
[199:26.29]Because if you talk too loud around one of those things, or if you, like, you're in the middle... Okay, let's say I was talking to the doctor.
[199:32.74]I'm on the phone with the doctor.
[199:34.42]And we're going over some very sensitive information.
[199:37.88]Yeah, okay.
[199:38.54]That sounds good.
[199:39.04]So we're going to come in next week.
[199:41.18]I'll come in next week.
[199:41.76]We'll do that other test.
[199:43.19]Yeah.
[199:43.79]Thanks for all the information.
[199:44.53]Thanks for all my medical records that we just talked about over the phone.
[199:48.47]Next week, adding to your calendar.
[199:52.03]What the fuck did you just do?
[199:55.73]No, no, no.
[199:56.03]What?
[199:57.29]Or, or... I'm sorry.
[199:58.83]I didn't catch that.
[199:59.63]What did you say?
[200:00.15]I wasn't talking to you.
[200:03.76]I'm plugging it from the wall.
[200:05.00]I'm not having one.
[200:17.32]Joke's on you, we're all Alexa.
[200:18.60]Alright, how do we even get on Alexa?
[200:20.40]I don't know.
[200:23.63]I'm gonna tell Google Home you're scared of them.
[200:31.17]Sooner or later, there's gonna be a service in the dystopian future.
[200:40.55]Where it is a phone booth that is padded, and you go in and it's called the monolog box.
[200:48.64]And it's just a spot for you to go in and talk without anybody fucking being able to hear you.
[200:55.68]You go in there and vent.
[201:02.35]But then it comes out that the boxes were bugged and they were being sold to Facebook and that's how you're getting your targeted ads.
[201:13.30]Monolog box.
[201:14.10]That's my bathroom.
[201:15.18]Thank you.
[201:16.18]Thank you.
[201:16.64]Thank you.
[201:17.00]Thank you.
[201:17.92]You're right.
[201:19.12]Thank you.
[201:21.73]I go off on full like theatrical monologues in front of my bathroom mirror.
[201:27.21]Or in the shower.
[201:30.79]It sucks when you get caught doing that though.
[201:35.94]This happened recently.
[201:37.65]A week ago, I was on like a full on just like, just like theatrical monolog, just talking into the mirror in like a towel.
[201:47.91]And Kim walked in the room.
[201:51.06]And when you have that scenario, where you're just monologuing, somebody comes in the room.
[201:58.20]you have you you have that one second panic ability where you either pretend you were talking to them pretend you were singing a song or pretend that you were on the phone pick one and it better be quick I didn't have it I just simply said you caught me just monologuing yeah I got nothing and she's laughed and said that I was she says like that you're a weirdo
[202:29.91]Or pretend it just didn't.
[202:30.61]No, you can't pretend it didn't happen.
[202:39.54]I'm a talker, though, I will tell you.
[202:41.10]I am a monologuer.
[202:45.67]I even, like, go over, like, just scenarios into the mirror that aren't even real.
[202:52.23]I have to constantly be in communication.
[202:55.01]Why do you think I like live streaming so much?
[202:56.64]I just love just being in constant stream of conscious communication.
[203:01.20]Even when it's with a fake person that's just me in the mirror.
[203:09.08]Also, fun tip, if you want to get even weirder, before you monolog into a mirror, lean forward, put your fingernail up, and make sure your fingernails aren't touching.
[203:19.44]Because if they're touching, that's a two-way mirror, and you're monologuing to somebody behind there.
[203:27.68]Fun tip.
[203:40.45]That's not true?
[203:41.09]It is.
[203:42.42]If you put your fingernail up to a mirror and your fingernails are touching each other.
[203:46.66]Touching.
[203:47.52]No space in between.
[203:48.32]It is a two-way mirror.
[203:56.33]Why do I know that?
[203:59.93]Because, I don't know, it was in like a book of fun facts.
[204:02.37]I don't know where I... I don't know!
[204:04.23]I don't know.
[204:05.07]It was in like a book I read.
[204:09.53]It was a book I read called, Avoiding the Government.
[204:17.32]It was from a Reddit post, we might, probably.
[204:18.82]I don't know, where do you, do you guys remember every small little random tidbit of information you've ever been told in your life?
[204:31.63]You just, you just know.
[204:44.57]Never monolog when there's a bird on your windowsill.
[204:47.34]That's a government surveillance drone.
[204:49.50]Birds are government surveillance drones now?
[204:53.32]That actually wouldn't surprise me.
[204:58.20]Birds are weird.
[205:00.87]Maybe they're just constantly just bugged out.
[205:03.55]It's just old technology that we don't even know about.
[205:11.41]Birds are not real.
[205:19.06]Birds are dinosaurs.
[205:20.80]Speaking of dinosaurs, I can't wait to get my monitor lizard.
[205:27.13]I'm not getting a monitor.
[205:31.72]They're huge.
[205:32.34]They're too big.
[205:35.30]I can't no I can't I although I have been doing a lot of research and I it does seem like for a large lizard the the argentine tegu is probably the best large lizard you could get in regards to how uh social and and just chill they are if you're in the market for a very large lizard
[206:03.77]What do you guys think I do when I lie in bed?
[206:07.11]I've watched probably 50 reptile-related videos.
[206:16.95]Just snakes and shit, but I don't want a snake.
[206:21.21]They're cool, but I don't think I could do it.
[206:27.90]Clint's Reptiles?
[206:28.98]That's- yeah.
[206:30.16]Yep.
[206:31.12]I've seen some Clint's Reptiles videos.
[206:33.50]I'm cultured.
[206:49.62]I'm gonna do it one day.
[206:51.38]One day soon.
[206:54.74]I don't think I'm going to get like a Tegu.
[206:57.00]I'd probably get something small.
[207:03.06]I would want to make sure I was prepared for that.
[207:07.30]What if your reptile doesn't vibe with Otto?
[207:12.35]Then they would be separated.
[207:13.65]They're not going to be together.
[207:16.85]Anyways, we got a little bit more to go.
[207:18.19]Let's go.
[207:19.81]Thank you to... Where are we?
[207:25.37]Crispin3day, thanks for the 400 bits.
[207:28.13]Jerma lied about not streaming for two months.
[207:31.01]I did.
[207:32.53]Thank you, daddy!
[207:33.91]How do you still have this username?
[207:43.60]This feels like a username that would get automatically declined when you make your Warcraft character.
[207:47.52]How is it still here?
[207:56.83]Thanks for the 1500 bits, Dad.
[207:59.41]They say wubba lubba dub dub.
[208:06.01]Excellent.
[208:07.11]Excellent contribution.
[208:13.07]Daddy again.
[208:13.95]Thanks for the... Thank you, Dad, for the 1500 bits.
[208:16.93]$30 total here.
[208:19.91]I really like the cough and puke mechanics.
[208:21.97]Super epic.
[208:22.67]That's talking about Dead Rising.
[208:24.63]Uh-huh.
[208:34.15]Hold on.
[208:34.53]We've got a video here.
[208:36.11]We have a video of ducks.
[208:39.03]This is from Anonymous.
[208:39.85]Thanks for the 500 bits, Anonymous.
[208:43.90]Hey, it's the Animal Rescue guy here.
[208:46.32]The duck you named and the duck Etalyx named had some babies.
[208:50.20]Here's a short 30-second video of it.
[208:51.96]Feel free to share it with chat if you want.
[208:55.36]Oh, yeah.
[208:55.80]Let's take a look.
[208:59.03]Baby ducks?
[209:03.23]Let's see.
[209:08.26]They say, also, go back to Resident Evil 2.
[209:11.24]It was top in your Discord poll of games people want you to revisit.
[209:15.56]Want to do the Claire storyline?
[209:20.76]Let me get this on screen.
[209:22.76]How am I going to get this on screen?
[209:25.78]Well, we're going to move to here because we're almost done.
[209:30.26]Oh, that's how.
[209:30.96]Okay.
[209:35.59]Can I get this on here?
[209:44.58]Let's go browser.
[209:46.88]Source.
[209:48.28]Nah, fuck.
[209:48.72]I have to do it in Chrome.
[209:49.60]That's why I forgot.
[209:53.42]I have to do it in Chromegalome.
[210:02.01]Actually, no I don't.
[210:09.15]Uh.
[210:11.43]What the fuck is going on?
[210:19.48]Can you guys see this?
[210:22.36]I hate computers.
[210:25.14]You know what I like?
[210:28.55]Toasted marshmallow jelly beans.
[210:31.29]Why can't this be more like a toasted marshmallow jelly bean?
[210:35.57]You know what I mean?
[210:36.05]Alright, would you fucking just open, please?
[210:46.37]Open!
[210:47.43]Mmm...
[210:54.21]Is it this?
[210:54.55]Let me try this.
[210:59.64]Oh, finally.
[211:01.30]It only took you like three years.
[211:08.23]It only took you three years.
[211:09.59]There we go.
[211:13.19]Alright, let's watch a baby duck hatch.
[211:16.55]What are you going to say?
[211:20.21]Did it fit you?
[211:21.65]Yeah.
[211:22.15]Oh, here we go.
[211:23.35]Oh, my God.
[211:23.73]That's its head almost out.
[211:25.39]Oh, there we go.
[211:26.19]It just got its bulge out.
[211:29.06]Yeah.
[211:30.06]Oh, come on, sweet baby.
[211:32.22]There we go.
[211:34.66]Hi.
[211:34.82]That's cute.
[211:36.02]I did it.
[211:37.68]You see all this?
[211:39.02]Its eyes are slightly open.
[211:40.98]Hi, baby.
[211:43.59]His head is real small.
[211:46.55]He's trying to keep his head up.
[211:48.47]The miracle of life.
[211:49.71]This is just like Jurassic Park.
[211:54.39]Oh, here we go.
[211:56.90]Oh my god, that's its head almost out.
[211:58.98]Oh, there we go.
[211:59.74]It just got its full jump.
[212:01.18]Wow.
[212:04.84]That was awesome.
[212:06.46]Cool duck.
[212:12.50]Duck's name.
[212:13.10]The duck's name.
[212:13.48]What's the doctor's name from Jurassic Park?
[212:17.36]Doctor what?
[212:17.74]Doctor starts with an H. Come on.
[212:19.75]Give it to me.
[212:20.03]I need it.
[212:20.77]That's the name of the duck.
[212:22.27]No, not Dr. Schmoikson.
[212:23.25]It starts with an H. The doctor from Jurassic Park.
[212:25.43]Dr. Ham... What's it called?
[212:31.68]Not Dr. Henry.
[212:32.48]Dr. Hammond.
[212:33.26]There you go.
[212:33.96]That duck's name is Hammond.
[212:36.30]Hammond.
[212:37.90]Little baby Hammond.
[212:40.45]Took you guys a long time to tell me that.
[212:42.69]You guys are usually quick.
[212:45.79]Hammond's the old guy, yep.
[212:51.92]Sounds good.
[212:52.72]Alright, good.
[212:54.12]Yeah, little Hammond.
[212:56.96]That's good shit, though.
[212:59.50]Thanks for sharing that.
[213:06.73]Hey, Kai!
[213:07.45]Hey!
[213:08.26]Thank you, Kai, for the 500 bits.
[213:09.84]A few months late, but still glad the birthday card brightened your birthday.
[213:14.49]It was incredible to see the pages filled with art and messages from Discord, Reddit, and chat in a week.
[213:20.51]It was insane.
[213:22.35]But I agree with your thoughts on birthdays becomes a number in another day.
[213:26.08]Spent yesterday just hanging out with friends and family, but cheers to being 28.
[213:29.76]Hoping to continue drawing more stuff from this community that makes me ask, what the heck am I doing?
[213:35.88]Take it easy.
[213:37.02]Much love.
[213:40.09]Hell yeah.
[213:42.37]Anybody that contributed to that card, thank you.
[213:47.29]It was overwhelming.
[213:50.63]And yeah, once you cross the, you can rent a car and you can be in a hotel room.
[213:57.58]They just sort of keep happening every year.
[214:00.66]That doesn't mean you shouldn't celebrate it, at least in a nominal sense, right?
[214:10.45]thank you man boy thanks for the thousand bits hey Jerma just wanted to share that after a pretty long time of trying finally found my first job in a theater theater like a movie theater or a theater like a theater production
[214:30.80]The pay isn't the best, but everyone here is nice.
[214:33.08]And I couldn't ask for a better first job.
[214:35.58]It was pretty hard and my mental health wasn't the best for most of the time.
[214:39.36]But your streams always gave me a reason to be happy and laugh.
[214:41.41]Thank you.
[214:44.57]That's awesome.
[214:48.83]He's on the screen right now.
[214:50.29]What do you mean?
[214:53.19]Oh.

[214:58.89]That's great, though.
[215:02.25]First job.
[215:03.95]That's a pretty good first job to have.
[215:13.74]Nice work.
[215:16.12]Hope you make some cash.
[215:18.46]And thanks for the 10 bucks.
[215:22.16]Take care of yourself.
[215:24.48]My first job was at a bowling alley.
[215:30.01]That's a good first job.
[215:34.85]It sucked.
[215:37.83]Still, though.
[215:38.70]Still, experience.
[215:43.24]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 2,000 bits.
[215:45.14]Jerma, I still don't see Jerma's psycho.
[215:46.92]I'm beginning to suspect you have lied to us about it.
[215:52.50]I may have lied about it, but it's gonna happen.
[215:54.63]I gotta find the right image.
[215:55.43]Alright, let's test the credits.
[215:57.71]Do they work?
[215:58.93]Please?
[216:00.53]They do, finally.
[216:01.57]It got reconfigured.
[216:03.90]Thanks to all the subs, community subs, old subs, new subs, all of you.
[216:08.64]Thanks for being the oil.
[216:11.80]And moves the stream forward.
[216:14.53]Thanks, guys.
[216:17.97]And thank you for letting me for the 2,000 bits.
[216:19.33]And again, for 300 here.
[216:24.23]Can't believe Jerma is a weeb now.
[216:25.81]That was when I was singing the song.
[216:27.71]I wasn't singing the song, I was just getting the pitch right.
[216:29.25]I don't even know how the song goes.
[216:34.65]He's grinding us into oil.
[216:42.24]Hey, Alstora, H2O, thanks for the $2.50.
[216:44.44]Hey, do you remember my birthday was last week, but I finally have the cash to send a message.
[216:50.32]Could I possibly get a QRS for the occasion?
[216:57.17]Yep.
[216:58.33]Yep.
[216:59.67]Oh, I can't.
[217:03.12]I can't do it.
[217:05.06]I have to be like shit-faced.
[217:06.94]I gave you three Q's.
[217:12.17]I can only do that when I have had like four glasses of wine.
[217:16.83]You got Q, Q, Q. Why do you back away from the mic so it doesn't hurt your ears?
[217:30.87]If I went like... It would be so harsh.
[217:42.93]I only unintentionally hurt your ears.
[217:45.65]Not intentionally.
[217:48.87]He backs away from the mic to breathe.
[217:50.40]Yep.
[217:53.96]But happy birthday, Alistar.
[217:55.66]Hope you had a good one.
[217:56.76]Enjoy those cues.
[217:58.76]Stinky Beaver, thanks for the 250.
[218:00.12]Unfortunately, I had to work all night tonight and missed all of Dead Rising.
[218:02.54]I was feeling kind of bummed out until I saw you alive.
[218:05.04]Thanks for making my night better.
[218:08.04]Yeah, we finished Dead Rising.
[218:08.96]It was great.
[218:10.95]I got a little angry at the end, but that happens in video games.
[218:13.93]Sometimes you just get frustrated and it's all good.
[218:15.89]That's what I tell myself in the mirror when I monolog tomorrow morning.
[218:22.77]Thanks for sticking around.
[218:27.17]Avery dropped dead thanks to the 500 bits.
[218:30.14]Hi, Jeremy.
[218:30.58]I just got off from work and I'm happy to see you playing Katamari again.
[218:33.16]It's one of my favorites.
[218:35.40]It's very good.
[218:35.92]I don't know what to say in this message, but I love you and your content.
[218:39.64]Spreading good vibes and much love to you and everyone in chat.
[218:42.65]Also, can you say hi to my Discord server who also watches you?
[218:46.53]They're called... The Poop Shitters.
[218:57.73]That better be real.
[219:02.53]Thank you.
[219:04.33]Thank you, Keith King Crimson for the 250.
[219:06.05]Really happy that you're playing more Katamari.
[219:07.42]It's my favorite game series.
[219:09.16]Also, if you do a public domain movie night, you should set up a green screen facecam and a movie seat graphic so it looks like Mystery Science Theater.
[219:25.27]Just the back of my head.
[219:28.40]That would be so dumb.
[219:30.32]Or just, I'm at the movie theater.
[219:31.64]Make it like a whole bit about it, like throw shit at the screen.
[219:39.00]Get angry, stand up, like, cause like a problem.
[219:45.87]Yeah, that sounds like fun.
[219:46.83]Maybe I'll do that.
[219:50.03]But thank you, Keith.
[219:51.71]Hey Hoops, thanks for the 500 bits.
[219:53.03]Have you considered playing Bombastic, the dice puzzle game?
[219:57.11]Keep up the fun content, by the way.
[219:58.40]Love watching you.
[220:00.26]I don't know what that is.
[220:01.88]Bombastic.
[220:04.24]I'm not sure.
[220:08.84]Mostly lost.
[220:09.38]Thanks for testing the bits.
[220:10.26]I'm not going to read your message, but thanks for the test.
[220:13.32]Test works.
[220:16.53]Apple Shift, thanks for the $2.50.
[220:17.41]Hey, have you had any wild dreams lately?
[220:19.83]I have wild dreams all the time.
[220:21.27]I just don't remember them.
[220:23.64]And I always tell myself I'm going to make a dream journal where I get up and just turn over and write.
[220:28.16]But the one or two times I've tried to do that, I've woken up from a dream and then immediately want... Alright.
[220:35.41]Do you guys do this too?
[220:37.05]Some of you have to.
[220:38.71]Right when a dream is over, you go, holy shit, that was fucking crazy.
[220:43.09]That was so weird and interesting.
[220:45.53]I'm going to go back to sleep and rewind and go over everything that happened.
[220:54.26]And then you fall back asleep.
[220:58.21]And then you get up and forget everything.
[221:03.11]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[221:06.01]So every time I do that, I don't turn over and write.
[221:09.27]I want to re-watch it.
[221:13.68]So my first thought is not to pick up like a notebook or an iPhone or something and write something.
[221:22.57]I have some really weird dreams, too.
[221:24.29]It's too bad.
[221:26.31]But yeah, I do.
[221:28.69]Hey, Zegheart.
[221:29.65]Thanks for the $2.50.
[221:30.23]I recently discovered that my 14-year-old cat is seriously ill.
[221:34.02]And I'll probably have to say goodbye to him soon.
[221:36.74]I've been feeling completely heartbroken, so thank you for cheering me up a bit with your streams.
[221:42.72]Sorry to hear that.
[221:43.32]14 is a nice, long life, though.
[221:49.42]Always remember that.
[221:54.46]Hopefully you still have a good amount of time left.
[222:02.01]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[222:03.43]Thanks for hanging out.
[222:13.32]Remember the time that you did have.
[222:16.52]More than a decade is such a long time.
[222:20.07]The memories are what matter.
[222:24.40]Thank you for sharing.
[222:25.10]Thanks for the $2.50.
[222:25.86]Gnarly thanks for the $2.50.
[222:32.20]As much as I'd love to watch you revisit Dead Rising 3 after playing the first two, what if you went back to that Rome game you abandoned that was the sort of inspiration for Dead Rising, with the green blood?
[222:45.57]Enabled because my mommy won't let me watch without it.
[222:51.27]Probably not.
[222:54.41]It's good to see the inspirations, but sometimes the inevitable end product is just way better than the prototype, I guess, beforehand.
[223:06.13]This is kind of one of those scenarios where I've played Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2.
[223:11.40]I wouldn't want to go super, super backwards to play their original game there.
[223:19.20]Interesting thought, though.
[223:21.00]The Rome... Shadows of Rome is by the same people that made Dead Rising.
[223:26.82]I think it's by the same group of big directors or something.
[223:31.84]Something like that.
[223:35.26]But yeah.
[223:35.90]Thank you, Geonorv, for the 500 bits.
[223:38.66]Jeremy, my first stream here.
[223:41.32]What's up?
[223:42.38]Been watching your stream highlights on YouTube more so.
[223:44.96]Glad I subscribed.
[223:46.18]Seen a couple people ask, but if you haven't answered, are you gonna play Code Vein?
[223:52.82]I wanted to.
[223:55.53]It just ended up being one of those things that... I got it, I bought it, and then it just ran out of gas before I even left the parking lot.
[224:08.31]I want to get in that car, but I have to walk gas from the gas station to that car.
[224:15.67]There's just so much stuff, so many games, so many things I would want to stream.
[224:21.79]But there's going to be a lull in stuff.
[224:24.84]Don't ever think that a game will never show up on the stream.
[224:29.56]Because once we hit those times, where two, three, four months go by and there's nothing new to do,
[224:41.41]Stuff like this would make an appearance.
[224:45.89]I play everything on this stream.
[224:48.57]There's not very many things that I would not do.
[224:54.35]Maybe, like, a full game of Civilization.
[224:57.38]Something you would never see on this stream.
[224:59.80]Or... Strategy games.
[225:03.10]But even... I don't think that's even true, though.
[225:07.86]Joel's Movie is another one that comes to mind.
[225:11.79]Yeah.
[225:15.15]But, uh, welcome to your first stream.
[225:17.27]I hope you liked it.
[225:20.55]Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[225:22.69]I know, but... But that's a little different.
[225:27.24]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is, like, different than, like, FTL.
[225:34.68]It is.
[225:34.92]Or, like, Civilization.
[225:37.49]Civilization.
[225:44.00]Salty?
[225:49.20]He's fucking salty?
[225:50.22]What the fuck are you talking about?
[225:59.21]Fucking goddamn fucking thing.
[226:01.73]No, I can't do that.
[226:05.17]Half of the people here right now may not have been here, like, eight hours ago.
[226:09.33]I can't do, like, the stupid fucking dumb fucking dumb fucking stupid fu- I can't do that right now.
[226:14.39]There's a huge amount of context to that.
[226:26.08]Not really, though, but still.
[226:28.90]But thank you, uh, Ginov.
[226:30.10]Giornov.
[226:33.17]Welcome to the stream, hope you enjoyed it.
[226:35.51]Modest Narcissist, thanks for the 500 bits.
[226:36.79]Hey Jerma, I'm trying to lose weight for my first attempt at cosplay in May for a convention.
[226:42.18]I've already made some small progress, but I was wondering if you had any fitness or diet advice that you could impart onto me.
[226:47.44]Thanks in advance and have a good night.
[226:54.18]First of all, it's a great first step to try to lose a little bit of weight.
[227:03.51]Hopefully your cosplay in May turns out great.
[227:06.91]In regards to losing weight, I unfortunately cannot give you much advice because I've been the opposite.
[227:16.22]My whole life has been I need to try to gain as much as I can and keep and maintain weight, not lose it.
[227:24.15]So I don't really have very much advice to give you on the losing weight front.
[227:33.36]Do not eat tahini if you're trying to lose weight.
[227:37.39]Do not listen to anybody in this chat.
[227:39.43]Tahini, if you weren't here, tahini paste is the most high-dense caloric food in the world.
[227:46.17]Do not eat that.
[227:49.28]But the real easy shit is just don't drink... Liquids take up so many calories, people don't even understand.
[227:58.56]Even shit like drinking orange juice, juices, sodas, if you just cut out
[228:04.29]sugary drinks.
[228:05.67]Somebody already said it, but I'm going to parrot it because it's the way it is.
[228:09.56]If you start replacing all your high sugar drinks with water or tea or even coffee, if you drink coffee, that's fine.
[228:18.81]Just don't put a bunch of junk in it.
[228:21.91]You know, you can get a coffee from like a Dunkin' Donuts or even a brewery at your house.
[228:27.85]You can put a sugar in there.
[228:29.53]You can put like a flavor pump in there.
[228:32.02]But just don't overdo it.
[228:33.44]Don't go like six pumps.
[228:38.92]Cutting out soda and only drinking something like water.
[228:46.40]That is hundreds and hundreds of calories a day that you're not taking in.
[228:53.64]Diet soda?
[228:54.84]No, I don't drink diet soda.
[228:57.72]Diet soda may not have sugar, but it still causes an insulin response.
[229:00.36]It's just as bad as normal soda.
[229:02.10]I don't know the science on all that, but I just know that diet soda is... You're not really doing anything for yourself.
[229:14.38]If you're drinking diet soda because you want to lose weight or because you want to drop calories, you're still drinking soda, though.
[229:21.73]You're not solving that problem.
[229:30.60]Diet soda fucks up your system.
[229:32.12]Yeah, but more so, you're still drinking soda.
[229:36.72]And it's so easy to just go back to drinking a regular soda, because you still drink soda.
[229:42.74]It's like snorting coke, but it's healthy.
[229:49.75]Coffee's terrible for dieting, because the caffeine messes with your dietary instincts and appetite, and it triggers insulin.
[229:59.43]Yeah, drink tea.
[230:02.82]But it's rough to say that to somebody, though.
[230:07.58]Because coffee is so... I love coffee.
[230:13.11]I love coffee.
[230:14.25]And if somebody told me, dude, you can't drink coffee anymore, I'd be like, you can fuck off.
[230:20.33]I'd be like, nope.
[230:24.89]But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
[230:31.64]I just love coffee.
[230:34.77]And eventually here, probably soon, I'm going to probably have to change my diet a lot.
[230:43.13]Because I'm getting older.
[230:45.59]You can't just like pound coffees and fucking creamers.
[230:49.80]I don't drink cream, but... You know what I mean.
[230:56.40]It's like not good for you.
[230:58.08]If you drink a bunch of coffee, it's just... I don't want to have like hypertension or something later on in life.
[231:09.86]But unfortunately, I can't give you that much besides general stuff like drink more water, and that's so basic.
[231:15.64]You can find that on any blog post.
[231:19.08]I unfortunately can't help you with weight loss.
[231:22.33]And I don't want to tell somebody, well, here's what you do to lose weight, when I have no idea.
[231:27.27]I can't do that.
[231:29.43]But I wish you luck.
[231:30.96]There's tons of great literature out there for losing weight healthy.
[231:39.89]Good luck in your convention cosplay.
[231:45.43]Hope it's a good one.
[231:45.99]Thank you, Modest Narcissist.
[231:49.14]Reaper, thanks for the 250, Jerma.
[231:51.10]I have an old SE.
[231:52.10]Do you want to buy it?
[231:52.96]No, you bugged it.
[231:57.18]No.
[231:57.84]No.
[231:57.96]It doesn't matter.
[231:58.40]I could have that cleared by like a tech that it's not bugged.
[232:02.09]It's still bugged.
[232:03.05]You bugged it.
[232:04.85]Thanks for the offer, though.
[232:07.87]And then finally, uh, we have Anonylus.
[232:09.67]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[232:12.45]Hey, Jerma, meant to mention that those baby ducks will be combating an invasive bug species that's arrived on the East Coast.
[232:20.11]The duck you named will have thousands of offspring to help the environment.
[232:24.95]Also, if you ever want to know a good reptile, ask me.
[232:27.17]I've owned everything, and I have over 7,000 gallons in reptile enclosures alone.
[232:32.46]Holy shit.
[232:36.75]That's a pretty crazy couple of sentences.
[232:41.25]Prepare the ducks for battle.
[232:47.33]Also, when's Metal Gear Revengeance DLC?
[232:56.59]I don't know.
[233:01.09]I don't know.
[233:01.51]I don't think so.
[233:05.17]I don't know.
[233:09.08]He's lied.
[233:11.21]Well, to be fair, though, did I ever say I was gonna play?
[233:13.29]Yeah, I probably did.
[233:16.81]But, I don't know, like, hey, I just finished the game.
[233:18.67]Will you play DLC?
[233:19.89]Uh, maybe, yeah, maybe.
[233:23.03]You can be floaty and aloof with DLC, in my opinion.
[233:33.74]He promises too many things.
[233:39.53]You don't have to complete DLC because it's added content.
[233:44.68]You can be floaty with it.
[233:45.66]You can.
[233:49.00]He just hates video games.
[233:54.98]I think I did say that like three times during the Dead Rising stream.
[234:00.27]Oh well.
[234:03.79]Just like Dead Rising 2.
[234:05.69]What's the plan for tomorrow?
[234:07.11]We're gonna finish Katamari Beautiful.
[234:10.66]And then after that, mystery stream.
[234:12.68]We'll see.
[234:14.98]Got a few things we can do.
[234:21.94]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[234:23.58]Same time, same place.
[234:25.80]Take care, guys.
[234:27.56]Thanks for watching, as always.
[234:28.88]Thanks for sticking around.
[234:32.70]For someone who makes a lot of WoW references, he sure doesn't want to make the classic guild he promised us.
[234:39.63]Yeah, but I opened up Warcraft and I got to like level 7 and I said, fuck this game.
[234:45.27]I'm not doing this again.
[234:48.19]I just didn't want to do it and it was like a lot and it takes a lot of time.
[234:52.44]It takes a huge amount of time.
[234:56.12]It's a fun idea.
[234:57.14]I tried and then I said no.
[235:05.72]So that was a lie.
[235:06.68]No, that was an attempt.
[235:10.10]I downloaded WoW Classic, I paid for a subscription, I opened the game, and I had the intention to make a guild, and I got to level 7, and I said, I'm not doing this.
[235:23.47]I didn't lie.
[235:24.21]I gave up.
[235:25.17]There's a difference.
[235:35.40]Bring back the polygraph.
[235:36.96]Polygraph stream 2.
[235:43.43]Giving up is worse than lying.
[235:51.04]Well, whatever.
[235:51.68]What do you want me to do?
[235:53.52]You want me to force myself to play WoW Classic?
[235:57.26]To get to level 60?
[236:00.06]So I can open a guild bank?
[236:02.73]And we can what?
[236:03.41]So we can just put like 500 stacks of thorium in there?
[236:11.33]I'll get to 60 and I probably won't play the game anymore.
[236:13.77]You know what would happen?
[236:17.53]I would have put a bunch of time in and got to level 60 and wow.
[236:21.11]Alright, level 60, let's go guild!
[236:23.37]And then I would have just fucking flaked and never played the game anymore.
[236:26.47]I would have just quit.
[236:28.90]Is that worse than giving up at level 7?
[236:33.04]I think so.
[236:40.04]You would have 5,000 people carry you through it on a golden carriage.
[236:43.53]I don't want to do that.
[236:47.87]I don't want to do that.
[236:48.75]That sounds like so not fun.
[236:51.31]What, do I have to watch people kill mobs?
[236:54.53]And like hand me items?
[236:56.21]I don't want to do that.
[237:02.56]I would just be like, alright, guys, I gotta go.
[237:05.04]I'm gonna go.
[237:05.72]I'm gonna log off.
[237:15.92]I wouldn't even want to stream that.
[237:17.46]That would be so... What would I even do?
[237:23.69]What would I even talk about?
[237:24.63]We could just fan you with giant leaves.
[237:32.37]And feed you grapes.
[237:35.31]The highest bit donator gets to be the one you slash follow.
[237:48.73]That would be the dumbest stream ever.
[237:56.59]It wouldn't even work because if I... If there was a quest I was doing and there were like a hundred people, two hundred people around me, I would never complete a quest.
[238:09.74]All the mobs would be dead and people would just be like trolling and killing mobs.
[238:14.60]I would never complete a quest.
[238:20.85]Please just do a carry me around stream.
[238:24.32]Are there any other games where I could just be like carried around and just do nothing and just get stuff?
[238:31.36]What other games exist that could do that?
[238:32.74]I just don't have to do anything?
[238:48.38]The MMO streams.
[238:49.44]Yeah, they were a mess.
[238:50.46]They were fucking hilarious.
[238:53.57]Rust.
[239:03.93]Alright.
[239:05.93]Get in the Discord.
[239:06.91]Let's wrap our brains around this.
[239:10.35]If you can find me a game where I can just be the, like, sultan...
[239:17.36]that just sits on a throne and just doesn't do anything and has the game played for him.
[239:32.80]And everything is given to me.
[239:34.86]Everything.
[239:43.10]The title of that stream would just be called
[239:47.28]Like, I don't know, like, it would just be called The Sultan.
[239:59.14]The title of the stream should just be called... Lazy Fuck.
[240:17.69]The lazy fuck.
[240:22.51]Does anyone really want to watch that stream?
[240:24.73]I know I'm like sitting here laughing and... But I don't think very many people want to watch the lazy fuck stream.
[240:35.07]And by the way, if I die, the stream ends.
[240:40.53]No bullshit.
[240:41.85]I will turn the stream off if I die.
[240:43.71]If I have to even exert any fucking force.
[241:01.98]Alright, let's look into it.
[241:03.12]That sounds like fun.
[241:06.20]Read a game where people could assassinate you.
[241:10.10]Okay, somebody mentioned Rust.
[241:12.30]If I buy like a 500 person Rust server, is that possible?
[241:25.35]No.
[241:30.41]This is so stupid.
[241:31.50]Alright, let me look into this.
[241:34.36]Float some ideas in the Discord.
[241:40.80]It could be Minecraft.
[241:43.65]Roblox.
[241:46.71]Yeah, I'm actually going to look into it.
[241:50.29]Just do Dark Souls 3 with phantoms?
[241:52.21]No, I would want there to be at least 100 people on screen.
[241:55.21]All just doing everything for me.
[241:59.95]I want people whose sole job is to chop wood and bring it to me.
[242:03.54]Even if they don't even need it.
[242:08.46]The fucking lazy Salton stream.
[242:18.59]How many people can you have on a Minecraft server?
[242:24.43]Can you have like a thousand people on a Minecraft server?
[242:33.14]Okay, how much is a 1000 slot Minecraft server?
[242:46.96]It's like 300 bucks a month?
[243:05.20]It would be for one day.
[243:06.50]Oh my god.
[243:09.79]I need to think about this a little more.
[243:11.75]This sounds really funny.
[243:18.85]Multiple grounds?
[243:19.71]We could even do multiple games.
[243:25.55]Planetside 2.
[243:27.51]No, I ain't doing that again.
[243:32.05]If you die in the first 10 minutes, that would be such a waste.
[243:35.88]And I'm not even saying bye.
[243:37.52]The second I die, the stream's off.
[243:39.52]Like, you killed me.
[243:40.46]Like, I'm dead in real life.
[243:43.31]You guys need to work together to make sure that does not happen.
[243:48.07]The second that my HP is zero... Ugh!
[243:51.15]Off.
[243:52.31]See you next time.
[244:04.35]He's gonna jump in lava for fuck's sake.
[244:07.83]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[244:09.37]Sleep on this idea, it's fun.
[244:15.20]Yeah, no bits or no, just the stream will be offline if I go to zero.
[244:20.41]See you guys tomorrow.
[244:21.41]Have a nice sleep.
[244:23.15]Good night.
[244:48.33]Thank you.
