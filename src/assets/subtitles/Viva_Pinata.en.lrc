[00:01.56]Hello.
[00:04.21]Good afternoon.
[00:04.73]How have you been?
[00:06.05]I have a mystery stream today.
[00:10.57]Can you hear my Xbox in the background?
[00:16.37]I can.
[00:20.76]This sounds like a spaceship.
[00:25.64]The mystery stream is Viva Piñata.
[00:28.84]For the Xbox 360.
[00:31.26]Mystery stream.
[00:35.04]Only going to be live for a few hours today.
[00:38.06]I got a lot of stuff to do today into this weekend.
[00:41.16]So I got to get on it.
[00:42.85]But I did want to stream.
[00:43.69]Because I like streaming.
[00:48.19]I had the demo disk.
[00:50.09]Well, let's see if the demo is as good as the real game.
[00:55.61]I'll just tweet this out.
[00:56.45]I'll be right back.
[01:57.48]Okay.
[01:58.08]Also, I'm going to be really honest.
[01:59.12]I have no idea what this game is.
[02:03.08]I'm just going to play it until I get bored.
[02:04.28]I never played it.
[02:06.48]I know this is one of the most beloved new rare franchises, right?
[02:13.96]I don't even know what it is.
[02:15.84]Every commercial I ever saw was just...
[02:19.84]piñata animals walking around and you feed them candy it's right up my alley so I got them I got them all I have every don't ask me why I do these things but I own every Viva Piñata game I don't know why I just do what if we get bored well read a book why
[02:51.37]Because when I was buying them, they were like $3 each.
[02:58.21]These were not more than like $2 to $4 each.
[03:04.50]So it's not like I spent a lot of money on these games.
[03:11.90]I got a few hours, so I figured let's throw in V for Piñata.
[03:17.24]V for Piñata!
[03:18.06]Here it comes.
[03:21.43]Look, I already... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[03:22.63]I don't want to get spoiled.
[03:23.99]Look, there's like little snakes and stuff.
[03:25.35]This is going to be great.
[03:27.41]You get to pick the animal.
[03:34.14]This game is my childhood.
[03:35.89]I know, it's like... Look, we're on childhood week.
[03:39.47]Chibi-Robo.
[03:40.61]Holy fuck, that was incredible.
[03:42.25]What an amazing game.
[03:43.43]That's my childhood.
[03:45.16]Viva Piñata.
[03:45.92]This is my childhood, Jerma.
[03:47.82]Cooking Mama.
[03:48.50]That was my childhood, Jerma.
[03:50.86]I played them all.
[03:51.66]I was very good at shopping.
[03:52.68]This is Childhood Week.
[03:58.71]Are we ready?
[03:59.07]I'm just gonna go.
[04:03.25]No Viva Piñata save game profile has been found.
[04:05.45]Do you want to create one?
[04:06.63]Of course I do.
[04:08.86]Oh, Sean!
[04:09.30]No, no, don't!
[04:09.96]I don't want him to see!
[04:17.64]Hello, yes.
[04:19.30]Signed in successful.
[04:20.20]Welcome to Viva Piñata.
[04:21.32]Viva Piñata uses an autosave feature.
[04:25.11]And removing an Xbox 360 memory unit or powering down your 360 while that is displayed will result in loss of your data.
[04:32.37]Additionally, removing an Xbox 360 memory unit at any time will return you to the title screen.
[04:39.90]Alright.
[04:41.68]I thought that was a Wii mode.
[04:43.22]Alright, learn about online safeguards.
[04:45.34]Why would I do that?
[04:46.22]I want to play a garden, right?
[04:48.48]That's all I can do.
[04:54.69]New garden.
[04:55.61]You make a garden?
[05:00.95]Enter a name for your garden.
[05:02.93]It'll be secret.
[05:04.87]I want this to be a secret.
[05:24.58]You guys are gonna laugh!
[05:35.31]It's good suggestions I've seen.
[05:36.89]There.
[05:52.21]Yes, put it on the hard drive.
[05:57.36]That was your joke, that wasn't mine.
[05:59.66]That was your joke.
[06:02.34]You guys all wrote that and I was taking your suggestions.
[06:05.64]Mine is to yourself, I'm a man of the people.
[06:07.68]Alright, let's go in the garden.
[06:15.98]Deeds?
[06:17.08]Stop showing my fucking name.
[06:21.77]You get to pick what animal you- I get to be a- An ever-changing world full of endless possibilities.
[06:29.47]Really?
[06:29.73]Because this is a world where you get to call the shots.
[06:33.04]Yeah.
[06:33.46]The piñata creatures and plant life that inhabit this land are all determined by you.
[06:39.18]From the minute you dig your first hole and plant your first seed- What, you plant carrots?
[06:43.42]You're well on your way to attracting your first piñata visitors.
[06:47.58]If they like what they see, these piñatas may even move in.
[06:51.60]Oh my god.
[06:52.94]As your piñata collection grows, you can choose which to collect and which to train.
[06:59.97]You can train?
[07:03.71]When illness or danger threatens, you'll need to be the one who comes to the rescue.
[07:08.05]Wait, you can fight?
[07:10.46]YouTuber voice.
[07:11.02]He's a narrator.
[07:11.88]This is called presenting.
[07:13.00]Of course it's gonna be like an E3 voice.
[07:15.04]It's a guy presenting a video.
[07:40.25]Do I have to clean all this up?
[07:42.91]Wow.
[07:43.77]More cleaning.
[07:44.97]I love it already.
[07:53.46]It's all we do on this stream now is clean.
[07:55.30]Alright, so I move around with the left stick.
[08:01.01]Talk.
[08:01.77]To Leifos.
[08:03.31]Oh, hold on.
[08:03.61]I was hoping someone would come and help.
[08:05.75]I was hoping someone would come and help tidy up this mess.
[08:10.11]You must be the new owner.
[08:12.93]I'm Leifas, and I'm here to help you.
[08:15.79]Alright, tutorial.
[08:19.47]Is she a piñata?
[08:20.61]Everything's a piñata here, right?
[08:31.68]Why do I feel like this is a Kinect game that I don't have the Kinect on?
[08:35.79]What was that?
[08:36.51]Alright.
[08:36.89]Cool.
[08:37.03]Oh, I can't wait for this kids game!
[08:39.47]Alright, we're done.
[08:52.91]So now we have... Oh, okay.
[08:54.59]I don't, I don't.
[09:15.63]This is the journal.
[09:18.29]It stores all the information that you discover when you are playing the game.
[09:23.28]The journal is split up into different parts to make it easier to find what you need.
[09:28.06]It works just like the menu.
[09:30.02]There's not much to see yet, so have a quick look and let's get back to the garden.
[09:34.75]Okay, let's get back to the garden.
[09:36.01]Alright, good.
[09:36.65]Louder?
[09:40.43]How do I make it louder than this?
[09:45.72]Ooh, garden area, encyclopedia, how-to, player awards.
[09:50.86]I mean, we can, what is this, encyclopedia?
[09:52.70]This just shows characters, garden constructions.
[09:56.20]We don't need any of this info.
[09:58.32]I know what I'm doing.
[10:00.32]Point and laugh at funny creature that walks into screen.
[10:03.73]I already know.
[10:04.31]Mm-hmm.
[10:17.59]Is that a mask or is that her face?
[10:19.25]Alerts explanation
[10:32.68]Hey, this is pretty cool.
[10:34.00]This is a Zelda character.
[10:35.32]This is a cool Zelda character.
[10:36.38]Okay.
[10:36.54]Cool.
[10:36.70]An animal.
[10:37.10]An animal.
[11:06.91]A broken shovel.
[11:12.76]You can't afford a regular shovel?
[11:16.64]This is not going to work.
[11:20.86]Why are there bite marks?
[11:27.01]Why are there bite marks in the shovel?
[11:28.69]You have to start from the bottom, friend.
[11:31.91]Oh, well, okay, menu.
[11:34.57]Oh, there's the shovel.
[11:36.84]The buttons in the top right of the screen tell you what you can do with the shovel.
[11:41.64]I have three bits of advice.
[11:44.16]One, you can clear the hard soil more quickly if you hold down A. Two, the shovel is old, but it won't break.
[11:52.79]Three, if you hit pinatas, they can become ill.
[11:56.67]If you'd like more advice... Wait, don't hit any pinatas with a shovel?
[12:02.75]So this is one, you can clear hard soil more quickly.
[12:06.79]Two, the shovel is old, but it won't break.
[12:09.35]Three, don't hit animals.
[12:12.94]Okay.
[12:22.14]Don't hit animals with shovel.
[12:32.57]Oh!
[12:33.97]Oh my god, it's perfect.
[12:37.55]Oh my god, it's a perfect game.
[12:40.23]Oh my god, it's a perfect game.
[12:45.43]Chocolate?
[12:48.46]What is that little thing?
[12:52.98]A worm?
[12:59.66]Worm.
[13:00.09]Crush.
[13:09.77]I'm not gonna crush the Wyrm.
[13:12.63]Wyrm, first sighting.
[13:13.85]Well, where is he?
[13:14.35]Alright, smash the junk.
[13:19.68]Smash it.
[13:26.88]Money, explanation.
[13:30.72]Do I really need to explain what money is?
[13:34.06]Where's the Wyrm?
[13:42.55]Is this a mobile game?
[13:44.56]No, sorry, this predates mobile games.
[13:46.78]This is what mobile games wish they were.
[13:50.10]In fact, this is what mobile games exploit.
[13:51.80]Alright, pick up the money.
[13:55.84]How do I get the money?
[14:01.25]Mobile games took this idea and removed the actual video game from it.
[14:08.47]Where are the pinatas?
[14:09.31]I don't know.
[14:12.23]You have a new worm visitor.
[14:14.03]Where is he?
[14:14.43]You have a new worm visitor.
[14:19.19]Worms have simple needs.
[14:21.25]As long as there's a big enough patch of soil or grass, it will want to visit.
[14:25.45]Oh.
[14:28.20]Alright.
[14:28.54]Take this grass.
[14:30.94]Ooh, I got grass?
[14:31.94]I have to attract piñatas.
[14:34.70]It never runs
[14:38.03]Where's my, like, piñata attraction spray?
[14:43.01]Okay, let's, uh... No spray.
[14:57.20]I'm gonna clear this whole thing first.
[14:59.26]Right?
[14:59.44]I don't want to leave any trash.
[15:00.96]They're not gonna like this.
[15:02.76]How big is my area?
[15:08.53]Okay, I got into the white line there.
[15:14.20]Did I just become a Viva Piñata streamer?
[15:17.30]I may have.
[15:18.66]It depends.
[15:24.65]Watch out.
[15:25.03]Watch out.
[15:25.45]Watch out.
[15:25.87]Don't hit.
[15:27.53]Get out of the way.
[15:28.65]Get out of the way.
[15:31.17]I don't want to hurt you.
[15:35.75]What do I do?
[15:36.93]Whack piñata.
[15:38.31]Poke piñata.
[15:41.27]Is it... Is it health?
[15:47.13]Wait, why can I do this?
[15:48.43]Why can I golf swing?
[15:53.15]I don't know.
[15:56.35]That's my first friend.
[15:57.45]You think I'm gonna kill my first friend?
[15:59.41]What are you guys, crazy?
[16:00.83]I wanna clear this.
[16:01.49]There's so much... Look at all this trash.
[16:15.41]Kill.
[16:16.37]Chat's the psycho now.
[16:17.55]Yeah, you guys calling me a psycho.
[16:18.95]Alright, yeah, this is easier.
[16:27.24]Just hold it down.
[16:29.32]Clear it all.
[16:29.80]Hey, do I get to expand?
[16:37.00]I get to pay money and expand, right?
[16:43.75]Alright, how's that?
[16:44.83]That's not bad.
[16:45.51]I have to plant grass.
[16:47.73]You missed a spot.
[16:48.51]Did I?
[16:49.17]Where?
[16:49.37]No, I didn't.
[16:54.07]No, I didn't.
[17:08.61]Right there?
[17:09.13]Where?
[17:09.41]People coming in from Ster?
[17:13.01]Hi, guys.
[17:14.91]We're playing an intense game called Viva Piñata.
[17:18.36]There's a shitload of blood in this game.
[17:24.30]You're gonna wanna stick around.
[17:30.99]In the settings, there was a gore setting, and I kept it on.
[17:45.79]Alright, am I wasting time or is this actually what I'm supposed to be doing?
[17:48.37]I should just do this, right?
[17:51.12]Just get it over with?
[17:52.18]Am I gonna have all grass?
[17:53.36]This is a problem.
[17:54.02]Am I doing this wrong?
[18:01.18]Because if... I don't just want a field of grass.
[18:05.18]Okay, I just broke the doghouse.
[18:11.13]The doghouse is gone.
[18:15.53]I'm just leveling everything.
[18:20.70]Don't hit the slug!
[18:22.06]Alright, how do I get the slug to move?
[18:32.15]Move!
[18:32.43]Move!
[18:36.73]Move!
[18:39.93]Move!
[18:43.51]I need to clear that.
[18:45.84]Hold on, there's some spots that I missed.
[18:49.56]Can I get them?
[18:49.96]Alright, we're good.
[18:56.50]Let's plant some grass.
[18:57.33]Or should I plant it just down?
[18:58.93]We'll start at the front.
[18:59.51]Alright.
[19:04.45]Grass packet.
[19:05.41]Grass packet.
[19:07.98]The grass seed packet is simple to use.
[19:11.43]Press A to go back to the game and look at the buttons in the top right of the screen.
[19:16.57]They'll tell you what to do with the packet.
[19:19.03]If you'd like to know more, press 1 now.
[19:21.57]I mean, it's grass.
[19:23.81]Alright, start pouring.
[19:26.12]Start pouring.
[19:40.50]He loves it!
[19:46.36]Get over there!
[19:46.90]Are you angry?
[19:48.82]Oh, here comes a snake?
[19:54.34]That snake looks like Otto.
[20:01.87]Oh, okay.
[20:13.90]The orange means resident?
[20:14.94]Name the new resident.
[20:16.06]Okay.
[20:16.20]What's the name?
[20:16.74]Wait, let me get some more... Does this cost money?
[20:45.31]Oh shit, there's another one!
[20:49.14]This doesn't even cost money?
[20:50.06]Those of you that said this was a mobile game, now you know it's not.
[20:57.46]What I just did right here would have taken three to five days and probably $15.
[21:03.22]Alright, come here.
[21:09.61]Worm 1.
[21:10.41]Well, that's not your name.
[21:11.25]Weeks, you mean.
[21:11.73]Okay.
[21:11.89]But I want to name this worm.
[21:13.27]Name.
[21:13.77]No, direct?
[21:14.05]Oh, I can tell him to go.
[21:14.87]Alright, information.
[21:32.62]Let's have some fun.
[21:33.18]Oh, nice.
[21:33.50]Comic Sans.
[21:34.28]Name it Harvey?
[21:35.80]Name him Bait.
[22:03.10]I have ten, okay.
[22:04.98]Romance requirements, one out of two.
[22:08.07]Conditions, status, alright.
[22:09.45]Let's, um... I have ten square tenometers of soil or grass.
[22:16.91]What the hell is that?
[22:17.91]There's a worm house in the garden.
[22:19.76]Nope, not yet.
[22:23.52]Alright, let's, uh, let's name him.
[22:27.84]Basic info.
[22:29.96]Age, zero days.
[22:30.76]Travel... What is... Worma.
[22:32.84]Hold on.
[22:34.52]What do I want to name him?
[22:40.64]Uh... Worma?
[22:45.15]No, that's so easy.
[22:50.61]Worma or else.
[22:52.15]Oh my god.
[22:52.83]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[23:00.28]There's going to be like a hundred of these.
[23:03.16]Should it be Wormo 1?
[23:04.28]There's going to be a dozen of these running around.
[23:13.85]Ooh, I got an achievement.
[23:16.77]Okay, cool.
[23:17.25]Let's go back.
[23:20.75]A bit more grass?
[23:23.47]There's another one.
[23:31.83]Alright, so this is via piñata.
[23:35.09]There's no point in this game where they hang from a ceiling and you hit them with baseball bats, right?
[23:40.81]That doesn't happen.
[23:41.35]That doesn't happen, right?
[23:43.19]I shouldn't be preparing for that?
[23:44.45]It does.
[23:54.39]I mean, it's called piñata.
[23:56.65]Do they actually, like, hang from a string on the ceiling and you go with like a pool cue and smash them?
[24:09.90]No, okay.
[24:11.06]You've attracted a sparrow mid.
[24:12.30]Sparrow mids can hear a worm wiggling from miles away and will come to take a look.
[24:20.70]Are they gonna get scooped up?
[24:23.82]Wait, another one?
[24:27.06]Come check out the grass.
[24:28.38]Look.
[24:30.42]Yeah!
[24:32.68]How do you like it?
[24:33.33]Do you love it?
[24:34.51]Do you love it here?
[24:36.93]Do you love it here?
[24:38.49]Where's your best friend, Snuffleupagus?
[24:41.77]Who's this?
[24:49.80]Willy?
[24:54.98]Just some normal guy.
[24:55.90]Thanks for the five community subs.
[24:57.38]Thanks a lot.
[24:59.56]I'm Willy, the... Where's the voice acting?
[25:02.18]So you're the new owner.
[25:03.08]Pleased to meet you.
[25:04.73]I'm Willy Builder, and I put up all the buildings around here.
[25:08.09]I can see you have two Wormas as residents.
[25:12.07]You'll probably need a few more.
[25:13.33]All Piñata need a house before they will romance.
[25:16.93]Since you're new here, I'll build you a Wormhouse on the house.
[25:21.42]Heh.
[25:22.44]Close this alert and show me where to put the building site.
[25:25.14]If you'd like some advice on how to choose a site, press Y now.
[25:28.14]Alright, I need to know this.
[25:30.52]Seems important.
[25:31.06]When you want to build a house, the cursor changes to carry the building site.
[25:36.84]Move around the garden to find a good spot.
[25:38.66]You can't put it down if there isn't room or other objects in the way.
[25:43.17]Okay.
[25:44.67]Spin it around with X to spin the site.
[25:47.25]Hold it and left stick, you can spin it even more.
[25:48.99]Alright.
[25:51.93]Just put a block on the ground.
[25:53.75]I yeah, but I mean I didn't This is a huge house, oh my Jesus this is for a worm?
[26:02.63]This is bigger than some apartments Well, how can I tell where the entrance is?
[26:16.14]Any grass over there?

[58:44.36]Here is a taffy.
[58:45.20]It likes flowers.
[58:46.08]Any kind will do.
[58:46.98]A taffly?
[58:49.06]There's too many animals to keep track of.
[59:03.05]But thanks a lot, welcome guys.
[59:04.03]Alright, I already got it, I got it.
[59:06.84]Alright.

[59:25.40]Alright, can I- They're chocolate coins?
[59:50.71]It's not even real money.
[59:51.25]Everything is candy.
[59:51.81]So the currency here, what's the US dollar equivalent?
[59:53.35]A bag of 30 of those little chocolate coins is like 80 cents, isn't it?
[59:56.43]Oh boy.
[59:56.91]Okay.
[59:57.09]Okay.
[60:18.30]Now Costalots is open, you can buy romance sweets.
[60:22.68]If you have romanced a piñata species before, you can replace all their requirements, except their house, with a romance sweet.
[60:31.14]Buy a sweet and direct a piñata to it.
[60:33.81]They should eat it and instantly they will have a heart here over their head to show they are ready to romance.
[60:40.39]This should make romancing piñata easier.
[60:42.51]Remember that both piñata will need a sweet.
[60:47.26]Romance candies.
[60:49.60]Alright, can I open this thing now?

[61:23.21]Don't eat him.
[61:27.17]Next time you put the cursor over a piñata, you'll notice the happy meter.
[61:32.27]The happy meter tells you about your piñata's mood.
[61:35.56]Every time something happens to the piñata, the triangles turn orange or turn blue.
[61:40.52]The more orange triangles a piñata has, the happier it is.
[61:44.40]And you can see this on the face in the middle.
[61:46.64]Okay, let's see.

[89:44.84]Alright, now, give me this.
[89:49.10]What is that thing?
[89:50.36]Sour Shelly bean.
[89:55.89]It eats seeds?
[90:00.15]Why does he look evil?
[90:01.10]A seed feast?
[90:02.18]So a hit with shovel.
[90:18.35]My name is Jardinero.
[90:19.71]What is going on?
[90:20.29]You've probably heard of me, and if you haven't, then you should have.
[90:24.18]I am the best gardener on Piñata Island.
[90:26.80]Even after all this time, there's no one as good as I was.
[90:30.76]The land that you are messing about with used to be my garden.
[90:35.04]I could make any plant grow and have any piñata stay in the garden.
[90:39.99]Well, apart from one piñata.
[90:42.50]Let's face it, if I couldn't get one, no one else could.
[90:46.22]Now, forget about all that.
[90:47.86]You've got a long way to go before you can even call this a garden.
[90:52.65]Not long after I started the garden, I met my wonderful wife.
[90:57.09]She worked on the ships, which traded piñata for other goods.
[91:00.78]This was in the days when piñata only left the island by boat.
[91:04.54]Piñata Central hadn't been built then.
[91:07.24]We got married the day that the first parts arrived to build Piñata Central.
[91:11.58]Mother, my wife, stayed on the island for a whole year, and our first child was born.
[91:17.40]We called him Stardos.
[91:19.40]When Stardos was two years old, my wife had to go back to sea.
[91:23.44]Vinyata Central had installed the first cannon... I'm sorry.
[91:35.92]It's a seed feast.
[91:37.12]Where is he?
[91:40.84]Oh, a new resident!
[91:41.50]Alright, give me my shovel.
[91:44.46]I'm going to hit this thing right in the face.
[91:45.92]Now come on over here.
[91:47.29]Why don't you come over here?
[91:57.03]Come on!
[92:00.02]Oh, I want you over here too.
[92:01.02]Look at this.
[92:01.38]Alright, so...
[92:09.27]Have children.
[92:10.33]No, you're always so far away from each other.
[92:13.03]Yep.
[92:15.17]Go over here.
[92:22.72]Throw it in the fire?
[92:23.58]I want you to get down.
[92:26.08]I'm trying to breed.
[92:29.80]I am.
[92:30.96]Have children.
[92:32.02]More worms.
[92:34.16]I think I have enough worms.
[92:40.68]What is this?
[92:44.34]Oh.
[92:48.82]Fanny Franker?
[92:52.49]Is this a base for a mailbox?
[92:55.37]What?
[92:55.71]Well, this doesn't exist anymore.
[93:16.40]Another cocoon hatched.
[93:17.26]Good.
[93:32.80]More worms.
[93:35.48]Okay, I'm done with worms after this.
[93:37.86]And I'm going to do everything I can possible to get those sparrows.
[93:41.34]You're not worming your... Oh, yes I am.
[93:48.73]I'm so sick of this worm minigame.
[93:53.43]Alright, finally, land!
[93:58.07]You and you, go!
[94:01.38]You know what to do.
[94:03.00]Here it comes!
[94:12.86]Come and get me.
[94:24.08]It's just free money.
[94:24.82]It's the same minigame, just a little different.

[94:53.11]Alright, here we go.
[94:54.97]It's the moment we've all been waiting for.
[94:56.23]This is kind of weird.
[95:00.41]I'm like, alright, let me look.

[95:40.28]Now do it again.
[95:44.49]Come here.
[95:49.07]No.
[95:50.07]I can't.
[95:52.41]What's wrong with you?
[95:54.65]What's going on?
[95:55.11]Why are you on fire?
[95:55.83]Is this on fire?
[95:56.51]Are you on fire?
[95:58.55]What's going on?
[96:01.32]It's on fire?
[96:02.24]How do I- Why are you on fire?
[96:11.93]He's gonna die.
[96:12.85]He's not gonna die.
[96:16.75]Alright, give me a seed.
[96:23.80]What's this?
[96:25.02]A seed?
[96:30.85]This is more cube than seed.
[96:32.47]Um, where should it go?
[96:33.69]Over here?

[133:20.91]We need him.
[133:26.54]He's gonna do it.
[133:27.18]He's gonna do it.
[133:33.48]They need to breed.
[133:54.80]That was sad, but we won the frog.
[134:06.64]I'm gonna build a frog hut over here.
[134:11.12]Welcome.
[134:16.14]Happy?
[134:17.92]You're gonna get a house.
[134:22.52]I live here now.
[134:23.46]Oh, and he's green.
[134:32.43]I want a frog house.
[134:40.42]What else does he do?
[134:41.10]I thought that was weird, right?
[134:43.90]Has eaten one green flutterscotch.
[134:47.20]For romance.
[134:50.22]I need more water for the duck?
[134:54.25]This game is so cute.
[134:56.01]It's just adorable.
[134:57.31]I need more water.
[135:06.39]Do I really?
[135:07.04]That seems like a lot.
[135:09.28]I'm taking up my whole entire space.
[135:10.72]Deer?
[135:21.91]Uh, I don't really want the deer.
[135:23.93]I'm gonna sneeze.
[135:29.81]I almost sneezed and pissed my pants.
[135:32.76]Information you didn't need but you haven't, no?
[135:41.06]Okay, half of my whole garden is water.
[135:51.50]At what point does this become ridiculous?
[136:02.33]Check your journal.
[136:11.19]Let's see the percentage.
[136:18.64]Okay, garden area.
[136:23.78]View space info, surface info.
[136:25.34]Okay, so each square is 1% of the total surface area.
[136:32.64]And 5% water is...
[136:46.66]What about the animals?
[136:54.45]What does the duck want?
[137:02.95]Oh, do I not know?
[137:04.51]Check the encyclopedia for snail.
[137:05.97]Okay, appear requirements.
[137:12.03]You are a level 4 gardener or better.
[137:16.14]Don't complain when your seeds start disappearing.
[137:17.64]Remember, I tried to warn you.
[137:26.65]Hold on.
[137:27.33]You get them to stay?
[137:28.39]It's eaten one apple seed, and it'll live with you.
[137:33.97]I don't want this thing to live with me.
[137:36.24]What?
[137:43.76]Alright, bunny comb.
[137:45.84]I can't look up anything on the... I think I have enough water.
[137:53.67]You purify them.
[137:57.15]Do you want to buy an apple seed and purify the slug?
[138:09.81]Alright, let me go pee before I pee my pants.
[138:12.41]That sneeze was a warning.
[138:14.19]I'll be right back.
[138:18.36]Hold on a second.
[138:30.85]There.
[138:31.05]Be right back.
[141:15.63]Now we can do that.
[141:16.39]Hey, see how you have the music this time?
[141:20.99]Very cool.
[141:25.26]Okay.
[141:26.64]Back to it.

[141:41.82]Frog.
[141:44.94]I need... Oh, he's sleeping.
[141:46.52]Look at this.
[141:46.94]This is amazing.
[141:51.42]He's so cute.
[141:53.14]Look at how cute this is.
[141:54.25]Imagine if frogs were fuzzy.
[142:10.22]That would be epic.
[142:11.86]Yeah, it would.
[142:12.18]What are you doing over here?
[142:13.52]Are you guys gonna go, uh... Yeah, you guys.
[142:18.46]I gotta sell more of you.
[142:24.15]I'm selling one of the birds, too.
[142:30.21]Yep.
[142:33.17]I wish frogs were real.
[142:34.53]Yeah, dude, wouldn't it be cool if some of these animals were real?
[142:37.15]Like frog, fox, worm...
[142:41.62]I wish frogs were real.
[142:49.32]Oh, here comes another one of these thumb things.
[142:54.75]No, they don't live here yet.
[142:55.69]I don't know what to do.
[142:59.55]What's with the audio?
[143:00.77]Audio should be fine.
[143:01.55]Maybe that's just a video game.
[143:05.53]I need to make money.
[143:08.25]I gotta make money.
[143:08.93]I gotta make some choices here.
[143:12.27]I could easily make a thousand dollars.
[143:19.22]I could easily make a thousand dollars.
[143:29.66]Burn a fly.
[143:30.56]I only have one of these?
[143:37.03]Oh no, there's only one left.
[143:42.42]Plant a bunch of vegetables and stuff?
[143:43.64]Alright, yeah, that's the plan.
[143:46.78]Alright.
[143:47.60]This is the vegetable garden.
[143:48.82]Right here.
[143:49.11]I need to be spread out enough where I can actually plant them.
[144:12.26]Sell fertilized vegetables?
[144:14.36]What can I put for orange?
[144:18.48]Pay the hunter for another one?
[144:19.74]Oh, okay.
[144:22.34]What does the orange fertilizer help make?
[144:25.20]Fence this shit in.
[144:26.05]I don't have enough money to do it.
[144:27.07]Is it carrots?
[144:33.65]Hey, get out of the way.
[144:34.17]Get out of the way.
[144:40.23]Orange stuff, like a carrot.
[144:43.60]Alright.
[144:52.33]You're gonna have to move.
[144:54.77]Actually, yeah, it needs to be symmetrical.
[144:56.69]You need to get out of the way.
[144:57.76]Actually, no, you don't.
[144:58.28]You're fine right there.
[144:59.52]Don't move.
[145:01.78]Alright, I'm gonna get a bunch of, uh, fertilizer to go on in first.
[145:08.16]Or fertilizer to go on after.
[145:09.12]Okay.
[145:20.70]After.
[145:24.52]I'm doing alright.
[145:27.10]I'd like some of your, uh, vegetables, please.
[145:31.43]Vegetable seeds.
[145:35.17]We got more.
[145:36.71]Poison ivy?
[145:37.51]Why would you want poison?
[145:38.67]Hazelnut?
[145:39.23]Cool.
[145:41.43]Alright, we're gonna do... We're gonna do carrots.
[145:46.15]A bit dog shit cheap, too.
[145:49.16]Good, because I can afford it.
[145:51.88]Get an apple seed for the snail.
[145:53.26]We love snail.
[146:01.05]Alright, but if I tame the snail... Oh, fool.
[146:06.03]Okay.
[146:19.95]Okay.
[146:20.81]Okay, thank you.
[146:31.96]Snail's a huge investment.
[146:33.16]Yeah, but if I... Okay, if I give the... If I give the snail... food... This... If I tame him, he's gonna be eating shit all over the garden.
[146:46.33]That'd be horrible.
[146:47.99]I'd rather just hit him in the head with a shovel.
[146:49.91]Alright, orange fertilizer.
[146:53.29]Here we go.
[146:54.55]Oh, damn.
[147:04.02]Okay, can I... Can I get them both in one hit?
[147:12.42]I didn't think this through, did I?
[147:17.34]What?
[147:17.56]They're already done?
[147:18.20]Too slow.
[147:29.02]Why are they already done?
[147:30.02]They worked for the first one.
[147:32.20]Alright.
[147:46.32]Only... This is 20 bucks.
[147:56.34]Yeah, the ones that are fertilized are 20.
[148:03.03]You gotta go fast.
[148:05.37]And you gotta plant them right next to each other.
[148:11.43]I've got a taffy sitting on it.
[148:12.91]In fact, I was about to sell you.
[148:14.83]No, just check out.
[148:17.13]Alright, let's do it again.
[148:23.84]This time I'm going to try to put them near each other.
[148:26.98]Are these two close?
[148:36.95]Is that too close?
[148:37.75]Like, right here?
[148:39.97]Carrots?
[148:40.71]Is that too close?
[148:45.23]It is too close?
[148:55.55]Get out of the way!
[149:00.78]Hit the guy, make it... Quackberry!
[149:18.58]Now, quick.
[149:19.81]Eat him.
[149:23.21]Actually, no.

[149:32.54]Okay, cool.
[149:32.92]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[149:34.86]I gotta plant some shit.
[149:35.90]Hold on.

[150:34.05]Got them all.
[150:37.02]Done.
[150:37.90]Thanks.
[150:38.96]I wish I could...
[150:44.47]There they come.
[150:48.70]Look at that quackberry.
[150:49.66]It looks like Daffy Duck.
[150:51.40]Oh, actually, don't eat that one.
[150:52.90]They're going to eat that bird.
[150:54.04]It's going to be so sad.
[150:56.66]Should I... Alright, should I just sell the foxes and focus on amphibious creatures?
[151:01.72]Yep.
[151:02.28]That's the plan.
[151:16.27]Alright, let's focus on amphibious creatures.
[151:26.79]Yeah, I'm selling the fox.
[151:28.65]Residents don't eat others on their own.
[151:30.77]Where's my new friend?
[151:45.49]Did I not pay attention to him when he just left?
[151:53.80]Sell them and the house.
[151:55.72]Don't eat that.
[151:57.12]Not yet.
[151:58.48]Wait, you're gonna eat that.
[151:59.24]Alright, if you eat that, then you two have to breed.
[152:04.22]Alright, I need a toad house.
[152:05.30]Alright, I'm selling the foxes.
[152:06.86]Wake up.
[152:13.34]We're going to give you to an owner that can take care of you two.
[152:15.96]They're big and grown, and they're going to do really well.
[152:24.60]They're going to get released into the wild.

[152:43.35]This is 1,500 bucks.
[152:43.69]Say goodbye.
[152:45.50]You're up.
[153:05.91]They were the only friends you had.
[153:07.05]Not when you're going to become an amphibious creature dome.
[153:18.86]Now, more importantly, we're making a bunch of water.
[153:23.25]No, no, no, I didn't fill that.
[153:37.07]Kill the duck.
[153:38.01]No, I want the duck- I want, like, ducks and frogs.
[153:49.52]And I have a shitload of money now.
[154:03.13]I don't care about the deer.
[154:06.40]I just want frogs, ducks, and other things that like the pond.
[154:11.70]I want a little walkway.
[154:19.50]Yeah, we don't want just one big pond.
[154:21.92]I want multiple ponds.
[154:35.34]Swamp?
[154:36.72]Kind of.
[154:37.02]I need a frog house.
[154:39.96]I will.
[154:41.80]Burn that damn fly.
[154:45.08]Fuck.
[154:45.68]I can only stream for like a little while longer.
[154:47.30]Shit.
[154:47.58]What?
[154:49.62]I've been having two... It's been two hours and forty minutes almost.
[154:55.68]It can't... No.
[154:56.24]It can't be.
[155:03.98]It's alright.
[155:04.26]We still have some time.
[155:12.59]He thought he was going to get bored.
[155:14.11]Omega lull.
[155:18.18]It's just kind of... It's just relaxing and fun.
[155:21.28]Okay.
[155:26.40]That's enough pond.
[155:27.10]Wait.
[155:27.38]We have one more over here.
[155:33.83]Snail?
[155:35.05]Where?
[155:35.25]I don't see a snail.
[155:37.55]Snail?
[155:41.90]That looks alright.
[155:42.74]Now let's build a frog house.
[155:45.28]Make sure I get that built.
[155:46.97]I'll get an apple seed.
[155:48.01]No, I don't want that thing living with me.
[155:57.47]Yes, you do.
[155:58.37]I don't want that thing living with me.
[155:59.43]Lick-a-toed home.
[156:00.59]Here we go.
[156:01.03]Is this Game of the Year 2006 material?
[156:14.38]This thing is pretty big.
[156:15.76]Holy shit.
[156:18.14]It has to be touching a pond, right?
[156:20.32]Or does it?
[156:24.45]Should I just put it right in the middle?
[156:26.65]That's kind of cool, right?
[156:27.57]Like right here?
[156:33.55]Spot on!
[156:45.66]That'll be cool.
[156:46.16]Yeah, that's pretty pog, I guess.
[156:51.76]I guess.
[156:52.94]Don't worry.
[156:53.36]Sooner or later, you're gonna have your own bedroom.
[156:59.97]Birds are gonna go, too.
[157:03.87]And the worms.
[157:12.33]They just don't fit in with my strategy.
[157:19.58]Birds and to- sparrows and toads and ducks?
[157:22.80]No.
[157:24.28]No, we want bugs, frogs, ducks, and platypuses and shit.
[157:37.30]You need a snail then.
[157:38.35]Swamp's not complete without a snail.
[157:42.27]That's fair.
[157:43.07]That's fair.
[157:43.41]Alright, I'll buy an apple.
[157:52.81]Uh, apple seed, right?
[157:53.71]Hazelnut poppy, where's the apple?
[157:56.77]Oh, it's not even an apple.
[157:58.45]55 bucks!
[157:58.75]Better be worth it.
[158:03.81]I'm just gonna put it down, don't plant it, right?
[158:21.98]You won't find them cheaper anywhere else on the island.
[158:28.74]You have 1.5k.
[158:30.06]Yeah, but I just had to get rid of expensive animals.
[158:38.65]I had two foxes in a fox house.
[158:40.47]I'm not taking that for granted.
[158:46.81]Didn't I already get one of those?
[158:48.17]Alright, let's open it up.
[158:49.45]What does the frog hut look like?
[159:13.25]It's beautiful.
[159:14.61]It's even got Christmas lights on it.
[159:16.17]I didn't even have to do that.
[159:18.95]It's perfect.
[159:27.88]I can't wait for you to wake up.
[159:29.04]When you wake up, you're going to see your new house.
[159:33.86]Where's the fox hut?
[159:36.18]Oh, you must have had the stream closed for like the last 30 minutes.
[159:38.70]Yeah, we're doing a new strategy.
[159:48.66]Alright, we want... What does it take for you guys to breed?
[159:51.42]I want to see a baby.
[159:52.26]Has eaten one green flutterscotch.
[159:56.67]What is a flutter?
[159:57.53]How do I get a flutterscotch?
[159:58.61]It's a bug.
[160:02.91]Green flutter.
[160:03.45]Master of disguise.
[160:04.15]It is easy to mistake it for blowing leaves in the breeze.
[160:09.38]How do I get you to show up?
[160:28.83]Um, you better... You better not be going to get that seed.
[160:33.89]It's a pain in the ass.
[160:34.81]The seed might plant itself.
[160:41.41]Oh, so just make sure it doesn't plant.
[160:42.71]Just pick it up every now and then.
[160:49.03]Aimed animals do not eat stuff.
[160:50.81]Well, I can make them eat, and then that's the romance category, right?
[160:54.21]To make them actually have sex with each other, you have to fulfill those categories, right?
[160:58.80]It's two out of three.
[161:01.90]These frogs will not have children if I don't do these three things, right?
[161:07.46]I think I have that correct.
[161:12.10]Stop saying the S word.
[161:16.80]Sorry.
[161:25.98]I want a... Look!
[161:30.44]They're meeting!
[161:31.09]They're friends!
[161:32.17]You see that?
[161:33.85]He licked him and he was like, yeah.
[161:36.65]Okay, now I can't get rid of the birds.
[161:38.19]They're friends.
[161:41.09]It's called fucking... Look at, they're hanging out on top.
[161:49.79]I can't get rid of the birds now.
[161:53.53]Wait, there's a third frog?
[161:54.59]No, there's only two, right?
[162:11.22]What the hell was that?
[162:14.64]That was a big inhale.
[162:20.04]Oh, I don't even need to do anything.
[162:21.18]I'm just gonna sit here and watch.
[162:33.12]When's Mario Sunshine?
[162:35.28]That's a pretty good question, considering it might start next week.
[162:40.42]But I'm going to have to dedicate a whole week to three or four plus streams in a row to Mario Sunshine.
[162:48.34]I don't know it's going to be the right spot.
[162:53.28]I'm going to go buy some stuff.
[162:59.28]And Viva Piñata, right?
[163:03.03]I'll make a moth house.
[163:07.67]Uh, maybe, yeah.
[163:09.59]This game is kind of just one of those games you can just turn on.
[163:12.73]This is a game you can just turn on.
[163:16.85]Alright, what are some fruits?
[163:19.59]Garden items?
[163:20.21]I thought we had some new stuff.
[163:22.74]Toxic drum.
[163:25.76]Why would I put toxic, like, waste down here?
[163:28.54]Flower carving?
[163:33.50]How is toxic waste a garden item?
[163:39.46]Produce?
[163:39.99]Is this bread and cheese?
[163:42.27]Bread.
[163:44.05]Who eats bread?
[163:45.69]And it's really expensive.
[163:52.29]Bread for ducks?
[163:54.01]It's 300 bucks.
[163:55.07]Do I get this?
[163:57.29]Ducks love bread.
[164:02.81]It's a loaf of bread.
[164:04.33]People are going to eat this.
[164:15.64]Don't put it in yet.
[164:20.86]What about some paving?
[164:23.76]Ooh, stone paving.
[164:25.41]Slab.
[164:25.87]Maybe some stone?

[165:53.55]What are you talking about?
[165:59.07]What?
[166:03.26]What's wrong with this?
[166:04.38]This looks awful.
[166:05.16]I'm not done.
[166:16.32]What's wrong with this?
[166:19.32]I'm covering up the dirt.

[167:24.17]Is there no pleasing you guys?
[167:27.82]What do you mean worse?

[180:47.02]Alright, seed.
[180:48.18]Apple seed.
[180:57.62]I still have the PC copy from when I was a kid.
[181:01.76]Will this game ever release on any digital platforms, or is it only disk?
[181:12.58]As in what it was Games for Windows Live, right?
[181:14.44]You can't even play it anymore?
[181:17.38]Okay.
[181:21.92]Here comes the snail.
[181:29.14]Come on.
[181:31.06]This way, snail.

[182:03.85]Yeah, but that's like a... I didn't even... Why would I have known I could do that?
[182:12.25]That's just like secret animal spoilers.
[182:26.27]We've been telling you the whole stream.
[182:29.67]Yeah, but... That's like saying, hey, I have a cheat code for you to put in right now.
[182:34.58]You're two hours into the game.
[182:37.30]This is the first time you've ever played.
[182:38.58]Hey, just here's the cheat code for like five grand.
[182:44.35]Why would I do that?
[182:59.48]Get over here and eat this.
[183:00.38]5 grand is 5 grand.
[183:14.01]It's still cheating.
[183:25.70]It's insider trading.
[183:35.41]Are these done?
[183:50.65]They've been done?
[183:51.49]I thought they were not ready.
[183:58.31]I thought, didn't everyone say they weren't ready?
[183:59.51]They open, don't they?
[184:02.70]Oh, chat was baiting you.
[184:03.88]Oh.
[184:07.96]Just tap them with a shovel.
[184:15.05]Ha ha ha ha!
[184:21.52]Oh, you go in here, because I need to plant you anyways.
[184:24.06]Like, why can't I plant you?
[184:25.20]I can plant you.
[184:27.91]Weird.
[184:33.43]How is it cheating if it's to progress?
[184:38.34]What's not... It's like, alright.
[184:41.88]It's like one of the first things everybody started spamming.
[184:46.24]Guys, I didn't even do the digging tutorial yet.
[184:48.98]And it was, burn the fly, make 2,500 bucks now.
[184:52.09]I didn't even know how to dig a hole.
[185:15.98]Please, Mr. Streamer, hit something with your shovel!
[185:30.95]Burn it, but keep it.
[185:31.83]Let it die if you have to.
[185:33.19]Don't sell it under any circumstances.
[185:36.25]What the fuck?
[185:38.91]Alright, fly.
[185:39.61]We're gonna do the thing.
[185:43.99]Come with me.
[185:49.67]Go walk into that.
[186:21.28]Who is a clever gardener then?
[186:23.82]You've changed your piñata into another species.
[186:30.87]It's a red hot.
[186:37.13]Can red hots in... Your gardening is improving.
[186:40.87]Did I just level up like ten times?
[186:43.44]I just leveled up like three times.
[186:48.84]It's like a peacock.
[186:59.45]What does Red Hot even want?
[187:00.99]It eats three chilis.

[188:59.09]Why are they worth less?
[189:05.81]Sell the blooms, not the plant.

[189:20.90]Oh, you fucking genius!
[189:30.86]I need to dig Don't eat that seed
[190:06.95]That's not cheating?
[190:10.45]No, because that's- that's just telling me what I can do.
[190:15.10]Me creating a new species and the- and selling it for $2500 is different than, hey, you can tap plants.
[190:25.92]One of them just died.
[190:48.85]Yeah, there's stuff stepping in my garden.
[191:01.38]Buy a better watering can?

[203:32.88]Thank you, Phylactery, for the huge money.
[203:35.64]They say, I don't think it would be a big deal just to skip to that one.
[203:38.44]As...
[203:50.53]is that that's true that's an accurate statement if you did that's fine just to do that okay alright so should I because this is a short stream today should I just do the tutorial in that game the next time I feel like playing this and just kind of skip through that so we can just play
[204:21.82]Okay.

[205:32.13]How much am I going to get for this?

[211:44.25]It's so dumb It's like somebody made a slime or sock puppet He needs a name
[212:03.19]Frogs are in the next game, right?
[212:06.38]Good luck getting them to have sex now.
[212:17.58]How did I not play this 12 years ago?
[212:20.39]What is wrong with me?
[212:22.15]This is so fun.
[212:24.59]It's just so... I just like it.
[212:28.23]Alright.
[212:29.93]Oh, I grew it.
[212:30.41]It's watercress.
[212:39.83]I'm gonna make everybody real sad though.
[212:41.33]Because people thought it was a baby game.
[212:49.30]Glasses cat is cool too.
[212:51.72]Well, if you're allergic, get out of here!
[212:53.38]I have to leave.
[213:08.42]Moms.
[213:11.86]Tap to get apples?
[213:12.76]I have... I have responsibilities that need to be taken care of.
[213:20.26]I have to do them.
[213:25.05]Tap the tree.
[213:25.71]Holy fuck.
[213:31.41]That's a lot of apples.
[213:32.31]How much does an apple sell for?
[213:33.41]That's pretty good.
[213:36.67]Alright, next time I'm going to have a bunch of apple trees.
[213:42.79]I'll leave a couple.
[213:45.76]Is this what moms would play before picking up their kids from school?
[213:56.42]Move to the second game?
[214:00.34]Yeah, what we'll do is... What is the second game?
[214:03.09]There's like two more, right?
[214:08.24]Those shoes, I feel like they're a hindrance.
[214:11.50]Trouble in Paradise is the second game.
[214:14.13]So why did they not call, like, Viva Piñata 2?
[214:18.83]Party Animals is the one that I played.
[214:20.27]Alright, I feel like I'm just starting to unlock the reason why this game is fun.
[214:26.77]So, here's what's gonna happen.
[214:28.46]You ready?
[214:31.02]So.
[214:33.72]I'm going to play Viva Piñata Trouble in Paradise off-stream.
[214:40.63]For an hour or two.
[214:43.23]To get just through the tutorial.
[214:48.13]No.
[214:49.95]No, don't.
[214:50.63]No.
[214:51.37]Why?
[214:51.83]I refuse.
[214:53.47]Just to get it started?
[214:54.27]Because we've already kind of seen the beginning?
[214:55.57]That's unacceptable?
[214:58.09]I think that's acceptable.
[215:00.93]So you guys don't have to see that this is how you clear dirt with a shovel. ...
[215:13.87]We want to watch, alright?
[215:14.98]We want to spend time with you.
[215:19.00]No, we're putting... Alright.
[215:25.43]We want to see.
[215:26.15]Alright, alright, alright, we'll do it.
[215:30.34]So, I'll just skip to that game.
[215:32.90]But for tonight, this is it for tonight.
[215:35.47]I gotta get some stuff done.
[215:36.79]And this weekend is... I gotta get a lot of stuff done.
[215:39.47]I've got... I have to be an adult for the next three days.
[215:42.29]I know.
[215:44.53]Boo-hoo.
[215:46.01]Being an adult.
[215:46.65]I know.
[215:47.29]Boo-hoo.
[215:47.69]It sucks.
[215:50.47]So, I'll be back on Tuesday.
[215:55.90]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[216:01.50]Imagine being an adult.
[216:05.82]Have we gone for the next three days?
[216:11.42]Thank you for watching this short stream.
[216:13.08]We're still gonna do the bits and everything and hang out for like probably 21 minutes.
[216:16.65]And we'll sit this right at about four hours.
[216:21.03]I am contemplating starting
[216:24.74]Mario Sunshine this next week.
[216:27.91]I feel like... Like a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... Could probably do all of Mario Sunshine this coming week.
[216:38.37]Or... There's a couple of games that are slightly newer.
[216:43.23]You know, Jerma only plays games made before 2006.
[216:45.80]I know.
[216:46.00]We'll see.
[216:53.03]But I'll see you guys later.
[216:53.97]Have a good weekend.
[216:58.32]You will see Viva... Viva Piñata will return.
[217:02.76]Just not this one.
[217:03.52]The next one.
[217:05.38]I am pleasantly surprised by how much I think this is fun.
[217:12.01]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[217:13.49]Have a good night.
[217:14.87]Goodbye.
[217:15.45]Thanks for sticking around for the few hours.
[217:18.01]Four hours or so.
[217:20.94]Good night, guys.
[217:25.64]With that being said, let's move on to the bits.
[217:33.84]I think that was a good little taste of Viva Piñata.
[217:36.69]Now I know that I want the whole thing.
[217:38.53]I want the whole meal.
[217:42.21]We'll get a good biome next time.
[217:48.29]Anyways, earlier we had $5 from AnkhWank.
[217:52.21]This game scared me as a kid.
[217:53.57]I'm not joking.
[218:00.63]Really?
[218:02.93]Why?
[218:06.05]I wonder.
[218:06.65]That's interesting.
[218:10.94]Masks.
[218:14.18]I guess some of them are kind of creepy looking.
[218:23.58]I could, I can understand.
[218:25.66]It scared me too.
[218:26.88]Really?
[218:30.17]Seems like a lot of people were scared by this.

[220:09.92]I saw the thumbnail and I'm like, okay, what the fuck is going on here?
[220:20.52]Let's check this out.
[220:29.10]Why is the audio so low?
[220:48.94]What the fuck is going on?
[221:02.73]Holy shit.
[221:17.24]I kind of have to watch this movie.
[221:19.88]What's it called?
[221:20.34]What's it called?
[221:24.54]Yakuza Apocalypse?
[221:36.88]Just play the Yakuza games.
[221:38.00]It's the same thing.
[221:38.88]Basically true.
[221:50.71]I did play it.
[221:51.57]I played Yakuza 0 and I got... I got... I just didn't give it enough time.
[221:55.87]I got bored.
[222:00.36]That was awesome.
[222:16.63]That wouldn't even hurt, though.
[222:17.65]That's the best part about this.
[222:20.53]That's the softest, fluffiest head in the world.
[222:28.43]And it makes this thud on wood sound.
[222:33.18]Holy shit.
[222:39.26]Is he Darth Raider-ing this guy?
[223:03.59]Well, now I need to watch the whole movie, so... That was a good little taste.
[223:14.81]Turned into a metronome.
[223:16.27]Yeah, what the hell was that?
[223:22.98]I think you'd like Yakuza 0.
[223:24.42]I got through the first four or five hours of Yakuza 0, and then I just stopped.
[223:29.40]Why did I stop?
[223:30.24]I streamed it.
[223:33.32]What was the point of me stopping?
[223:36.49]Why did I stop?
[223:37.05]I gave a reason, right?
[223:45.98]People were getting bored.
[223:47.04]I got annoyed with it.
[223:54.06]Because there was 100 hours left.
[223:58.84]There's a lot of dialog you have to read.
[224:01.04]You hate good games.
[224:02.16]I just played Chibi-Robo yesterday and it was one of my favorites.
[224:04.82]Come on.
[224:10.01]Play it again and find out.
[224:15.91]He hates good games.
[224:17.69]He hates games.
[224:18.80]There it is.
[224:19.48]I was waiting for it.
[224:21.06]Hey, peaceful Haley.
[224:21.82]Thanks for the $2.50.
[224:24.96]Jerem, I'm so happy you're finally playing this.
[224:27.12]I actually used to get made fun of for playing this.
[224:31.61]People were saying, like, oh, it's a game for babies.
[224:36.11]I like the kids' games now.
[224:37.61]They're, like, fun.
[224:38.45]I like the E for Everyone games.
[224:41.18]I love them now.
[224:42.80]They're some of my favorites at this point.
[224:48.00]It's not Dark Souls.
[224:52.95]Just wait.
[224:53.65]I'm gonna be playing Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games real soon, probably.
[224:57.69]No, actually, it's, um... London 2012, I think, is the Olympics game that I'm gonna play.
[225:08.54]Oh, spoiler, sorry.
[225:12.64]It's a game where you, like, tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.
[225:15.22]Oh, let go!
[225:16.72]Can't wait.
[225:24.23]But you'll see that eventually.
[225:26.09]Anyways, they say, I can't find this game for cheap.
[225:30.04]People are charging like 30 bucks or more for this.
[225:32.38]And I don't know if they sell 360 games anymore in stores.
[225:34.76]Anyway, I hope you enjoy Viva Piñata.
[225:36.98]I thought I bought this, all three of them.
[225:43.13]I thought I bought them all for cheap, cheap, cheap.
[225:56.38]Yeah, you can get this for like five bucks.
[226:01.46]If you go on Amazon or eBay, Amazon has currently... Amazon has 71 copies, and they sell from $5.42.
[226:13.53]So, they are available.
[226:26.42]Sella yeah selling out for a 15 year old game that they don't even make anymore Speaking of not making things anymore, what does rare even do now?
[226:45.84]There's like a whole rare office at Microsoft They made Sea of Thieves
[226:57.68]Yeah.
[227:06.04]I heard Sea Thieves is actually kind of fun.
[227:08.90]I'm not gonna say, oh my god, remember when Rare used to make good games?
[227:12.36]Remember when Rare?
[227:13.34]I mean, I've heard Sea Thieves is actually kind of fun.
[227:19.81]I don't know how fun.
[227:23.97]It's fun with friends.
[227:27.16]But anyways, uh, yeah, you can get it for five to six bucks.
[227:34.20]Thanks, Hayley, for the two-bit.
[227:36.20]They're doing Battletoads?
[227:37.32]Oh, that's really cool.
[227:38.74]I hope it's good.
[227:40.94]When they redid, uh, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles beat-em-up, it was absolutely fucking atrocious.
[227:47.90]So, old beat-em-ups, they try to translate them into 3D, and they try to translate them into the, kind of, 2020.
[227:58.18]I haven't played one that I thought was any good.
[228:00.56]That was supposed to be some kind of reimagining or remake of an old classic.
[228:07.12]Sure, there have been some beat-em-ups that have come out that are 2D.
[228:15.67]They made the original Battletoads.
[228:17.13]That should be good.
[228:17.81]I hope so.
[228:24.45]Looks cool.
[228:26.15]Making a Breath of the Wild clone.
[228:27.89]Really?
[228:29.27]Look into that.
[228:29.73]Hey Lucas!
[228:32.47]Or Lucius, thanks for the 500 bits.
[228:34.46]Hey Jerma, just want to show some appreciation.
[228:37.40]I know this was a while back, but I really loved your Outer Worlds stream, so I'm thinking of playing it myself.
[228:42.64]I don't usually play scary games, but I think having watch you play it first is gonna help.
[228:46.67]Anyway, have a good night.
[228:47.49]That game's only as scary as you make it.
[228:54.31]It's more exploration than it is scary.
[229:00.37]Like, if you fly a thousand miles per hour into a planet, you'll scream.
[229:03.15]That's scary.
[229:05.34]I did it a lot.
[229:06.44]It was actually terrifying.
[229:09.42]But the game itself is, um... The anglerfish are kind of terrifying.
[229:17.82]And I guess you can't just avoid that place.
[229:21.20]You know what I mean?
[229:21.70]Like, it's not just like, oh, I just won't do that part.
[229:23.76]Well, you have to.
[229:24.28]You know what I mean?
[229:25.06]You have to, like, do... You have to go to, like, that... All the planets.
[229:28.64]Like, you can skip it.
[229:33.90]But, yeah.
[229:34.94]Hope you had fun with it.
[229:35.52]It was a great game.
[229:37.60]It was very, very, very fun.
[229:43.23]Hey, Grave Embrace, thanks for the $3.60.
[229:45.21]$3.60.
[229:46.37]Uh... They linked an image.
[229:53.95]It says, For safety reasons, we recommend you to use a special password that you don't use anywhere on the internet.
[230:02.02]Reliability level tall.
[230:06.42]Password must consistent.
[230:07.40]What is this?
[230:07.84]I don't know what this is.
[230:17.50]I don't get it.
[230:19.98]Because I'm short or something?
[230:24.14]Is it a pre-stream joke?
[230:25.68]Oh.
[230:30.16]Filactory, thanks for the hundred bucks.
[230:35.46]Actually, more than that.
[230:37.91]150 bucks.
[230:39.65]Because of the last message.
[230:42.43]Thanks a lot, dude.
[230:45.59]You continue to give stupid amounts of money to this stream.
[230:50.08]It's a lot of fucking money.
[230:51.64]And you give it all the time.
[230:53.46]So thank you again.
[230:54.36]Thanks a lot.
[231:05.27]The stalker guy is gonna give you a million dollars.
[231:07.49]No, I made it really clear.
[231:08.79]I don't- I don't take bribes.
[231:17.28]But, thanks a lot.
[231:19.52]Sam Freelance Police, thanks for the 500 bits.
[231:21.58]Hey Jerma, I turned 20 on Monday.
[231:23.24]Happy 20th birthday.
[231:25.52]Hope you had a good one.
[231:28.05]Wajid.
[231:29.45]Wajid.
[231:31.41]What'd you get on your birthday?
[231:35.37]Corned beef hash?
[231:37.03]What was it?
[231:38.61]Was it corned beef hash?
[231:47.25]Corned beef hash.
[231:48.03]Alright, nice.
[231:48.51]This one, I always have to make sure that people are reading that.
[231:55.26]I'm having a mild crisis though.
[231:56.58]I'm studying game design in university, but I also recently got into music production.
[232:00.94]I had a lot more fun working on a song I sent you than any game design project.
[232:05.25]And I've been spending my semester break learning and doing more music stuff.
[232:10.28]I feel like I'm going to pursue this professionally.
[232:12.28]I don't know what to focus on now for a future career.
[232:16.02]If I should switch courses or stay, have you got any advice?
[232:22.91]The best advice that I could possibly give for something like this is I would try to do them both.
[232:34.13]Now, I don't know how far into game design you are.
[232:40.96]As you say, I'm studying game design at university.
[232:43.90]How far into game design university are you?
[232:50.04]Just do both!
[232:51.70]Well, what I mean by that is, you can make music in your free time, but also study to do something like game design.
[233:04.97]And like I said before, I don't know how many years or so you've been pursuing a game design degree.
[233:16.02]That's literally what I'm going to do.
[233:17.54]Yeah.
[233:20.60]You're making progress learning music on your own.
[233:22.10]Keep studying game design.
[233:23.20]Work on music as a passion.
[233:24.30]Yeah.
[233:28.19]Now, one of the arguments against that would be, well, I can't dedicate my time to both at the same time and put the passion I want to put into my music projects because of all the stuff I have to put into my game design schoolwork and projects.
[233:44.50]But that's how you try to make a balance just for your life in general.
[233:52.90]And it is hard to do that.
[233:55.27]It is hard to work and do a passion at the same time.
[234:00.55]It is hard to have two passions that you equally care about and give them both the same amount of attention.
[234:07.21]It's hard to do that.
[234:13.64]But I would say for as long as you can, and depending on, like I said, how long you've been in school for, I would try to keep up getting your degree in game design while doing music on the side.
[234:28.33]But also, I'm not you.
[234:33.87]If I really, really cared about music production, and that's, I know it now, this is all I fucking care about, it's all I want to do.
[234:43.41]There's also that scenario where you'll finish your game design degree, and you'll be like, I don't even want to do this now.
[234:52.38]But actually, that's not...
[234:56.01]Unfortunately, that's not necessarily an uncommon thing that happens in college.
[235:01.65]A lot of people will go to school for something and then just decide that it's not something they wanted to do.
[235:13.40]So it can be tricky.
[235:15.20]And I, unfortunately, I don't have the right answer for you.
[235:19.58]I think you already might know the answer.
[235:31.98]I think you might already know the answer.
[235:37.74]I don't.
[235:38.82]Feels good, man.
[235:46.34]I wish you luck with whatever you do.
[235:48.41]Whether you pursue music or you pursue game design or you try to do them both.
[235:54.07]I wish you luck.
[235:58.34]Right.
[235:58.74]That's true.
[235:59.20]Feels amazing, man.
[235:59.99]I don't know.
[236:00.37]But I wish you luck.
[236:00.87]Thanks for the five bucks.
[236:22.64]Gabe the Idiot, thanks for the five dollars as well.
[236:26.46]Love you.
[236:46.03]Now, what if I wore an eyepatch all of Tuesday?
[236:47.81]And I winked with the eye that was under the eyepatch?
[236:49.82]That would be fun.
[237:19.52]Hey, Zifflo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[237:21.40]Thanks for all the streams, lad.
[237:22.46]You've helped me get through some tough times.
[237:24.06]And now you're playing one of my favorite childhood games.
[237:26.02]Keep it up.
[237:26.38]I told you, this is childhood week.
[237:30.31]BB Robo, Cooking Mama.
[237:33.05]And then... BB Pinot.
[237:39.75]I got the penis shirt still saved as a tab, but I just clicked on it.
[237:44.43]God damn it.
[237:47.30]Penis, like, smoking camel guy.
[237:53.17]Let's run the credits.
[237:54.89]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[237:55.79]Have a great weekend.
[237:57.67]Coming back with potentially Mario Sunshine.
[238:00.85]If not Mario Sunshine, then... No, actually, I probably... No, I'm not gonna do Mario Sunshine on Tuesday.
[238:07.36]That's, like, the wink apocalypse.
[238:09.80]Mm-mm.
[238:11.12]No.
[238:14.04]Don't.
[238:16.20]I'm not going to do Wink Apocalypse and then, hey, let's start Mario Sunshine.
[238:19.50]No, no, no.
[238:19.90]There's got to be something else.
[238:25.24]Thanks for all the subs.
[238:30.16]All of you, thank you.
[238:34.93]The continued subscriptions to this channel is crazy.
[238:40.29]Thanks a lot again.
[238:40.93]I say it a lot.
[238:42.37]I say it every single stream, obviously.
[238:45.75]But thank you.
[238:47.89]Just keep winks.
[238:48.73]It's not that bad.
[238:49.59]No, I'm going to replace it.
[238:50.93]It's got to change every few months.
[238:56.07]Do besiege or Ellie bits?
[238:58.33]I want to do something where I can be on camera.
[239:01.26]So it's going to be a full, a total, an entire facecam stream.
[239:04.90]Because I'm not going to turn cam on and turn cam off to wink.
[239:12.22]And they're going to be significantly reduced in price.
[239:17.78]We'll see.
[239:22.14]But, uh, we had... Vilemi and Phylactery Lich back-to-back gave $50.
[239:28.89]A few minutes ago.
[239:33.27]Both of you, Vilemi, $50 fucking dollars.
[239:36.31]Phylactery, $50.
[239:36.99]Vilemi says, Hey Jerm, I've been a while since I've been able to watch one of your streams, and I can't help but notice there's still no Jerma Psycho emote.
[239:44.80]Would you like to explain yourself?
[239:50.15]Yeah.
[239:52.54]I know.
[239:53.22]I know.
[239:53.68]I have to sit down.
[239:54.52]I just... I've enabled more BTTV emotes than my own emotes that you pay for in the last 30 days.
[240:03.33]I'm gonna... I'm gonna dump a ton of new emotes on you guys randomly.
[240:08.97]You're gonna get a shitload of them.
[240:10.43]And I'm not even gonna tell... It's just gonna happen.
[240:22.20]Don't worry.
[240:23.14]I will.
[240:23.74]I will, I will, I will, I will.
[240:25.28]A 50-part Bugleberry emote.
[240:27.42]No.
[240:32.00]Uh, Spiritual Hog, thanks for the 400 bits.
[240:35.56]Check out Amazing Island for the GameCube.
[240:37.38]Might be a good stream game.
[240:39.46]I think I was looking at that.
[240:40.30]I didn't buy it, though.
[240:42.62]I was looking at it, I think.
[240:43.50]Amazing Island.
[240:49.78]Yeah, I was looking at this.
[240:54.34]Maybe I'll get it.
[240:58.09]And finally, Gooberry Juice with $2.50.
[241:01.13]Thanks for the $2.50.
[241:03.53]They say, Hey JermaChan, I also very much agree on you streaming the Yakuza games again.
[241:08.70]Although I would recommend one of the games with less minigame grinding.
[241:12.54]Like the businesses in Yakuza 0.
[241:16.05]Some other good starters are Yakuza 4 or 3.
[241:18.27]Those two are way more straight to the point.
[241:21.90]Plus, they're really easy to get invested into.
[241:25.44]Yakuza 0 is the meme one, so that's a bummer.
[241:29.06]Here's a clip of some of the chaos you might see.
[241:49.30]Alright, alright, alright, okay.
[241:50.76]Alright.
[241:51.56]I might just play it.
[241:52.34]Alright.
[241:56.15]I know they're fucking funny and they're crazy.
[241:58.27]I know, I know, I know.
[242:01.41]I know.
[242:01.89]I really should play them.
[242:04.36]Just, for some reason, I got... I probably shouldn't have started with the Cures of Zero.
[242:07.62]That was one that was on the PS4, though.
[242:12.69]But without further ado, I've got to get out of here.
[242:14.81]I spent actually a little more time than I was supposed to today.
[242:18.14]But it's okay.
[242:18.76]I can still get the hell out of here right now and go do the errand that I need to do and then do the stuff I need to do this weekend.
[242:24.72]Have a great weekend.
[242:25.65]Goodbye.
[242:26.33]Good night.
[242:28.03]See you soon.
[242:29.31]Take care, everybody.
[242:31.17]See you Tuesday.
[242:32.97]Good night.
[242:46.35]you
[243:21.21]you
