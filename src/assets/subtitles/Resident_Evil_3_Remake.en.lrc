[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.90]Good afternoon.
[00:05.39]How are you?
[00:08.77]Welcome to another live stream.
[00:11.13]I'll be your host for the evening.
[00:15.74]So I listened to the radio the other day and I didn't, I was going to bring this up yesterday, but I forgot to.
[00:23.26]Uh, people that do radio and talk radio.
[00:27.56]They talk for probably 5 to 10 minutes.
[00:31.78]And then there's 5 to 10 minutes of ads.
[00:35.76]They do like 2 to 3 hour long blocks.
[00:39.01]And they actually only speak for about 40 minutes.
[00:43.37]I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is this?
[00:50.28]And we're back.
[00:51.32]And sometimes, sometimes they do the, and we're back, speak for 30 seconds, and then do 10 minutes of ads.
[01:01.78]That's a, what the fuck is going on there?
[01:04.22]That's unbelievable.
[01:07.97]I'm sitting there going, people on Twitch sit here and they broadcast for like eight hours sometimes.
[01:14.53]Can you imagine if I, every 10 minutes, took a 10 minute ad break?
[01:19.99]We would never get anything done.
[01:21.21]How does anybody on the radio get anything done?
[01:29.05]Like when you get, when you get into a conversation, you start really talking.
[01:34.09]It takes longer than like six minutes to have a conversation.
[01:37.01]Like that's, you can't have a conversation in six minutes.
[01:43.90]He hates ads.
[01:48.28]No, I don't hate ads.
[01:52.39]I kind of do.
[01:54.11]Who likes ads?
[01:56.29]Nobody likes ads.
[01:57.41]I'm just saying.
[01:58.03]I'm sitting here going, what if I ran a fucking commercial every four minutes?
[02:03.22]And the commercial wasn't 30 seconds long.
[02:04.84]It was six minutes long.
[02:07.60]You guys would run away.
[02:08.34]I didn't even give... Oh, fuck.
[02:11.30]I was going to say Resident Evil 3 tonight.
[02:15.08]My tweet, and I didn't do it.
[02:16.38]Here we go.
[02:18.08]I almost hit send.
[02:22.26]People who run ads like ads.
[02:25.90]Yeah, I guess that's true, because then that's... you get paid, I guess.
[02:31.05]I don't like the title.
[02:32.27]The title is dogshit, but what do you want me to title this?
[02:38.63]I'm like streamer number 450,000 that has played this game.
[02:44.41]I don't gotta... what do you want me to do for a funny title?
[02:49.27]All the funny titles have been sapped.
[02:51.17]They've all been done.
[02:51.85]You've already seen them all.
[02:56.59]E. I did write E. E's in the title.
[03:00.01]It's E. Resident E. Resident E?
[03:06.14]How about just Resident E?
[03:09.74]Just E?
[03:11.24]Just title it E. Alright, just E.
[03:22.02]Is that better?
[03:24.94]Just E?
[03:25.41]E. Alright, now I'm keeping it.
[03:34.29]I'm keeping it.
[03:34.97]We're gonna play Resident Evil 3 tonight.
[03:36.41]Just E. I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[03:47.97]And yeah, I've been waiting for it, but I'm keeping my expectations pretty low.
[03:54.02]Because for every one person that says, it's alright, there's a hundred people that say, don't play it, it's going to ruin what you like about the second one.
[04:02.60]So, I'm going to keep myself at a very, I'm going to be low energy tonight.
[04:08.12]I'm going to be dialed back low energy.
[04:09.78]I don't want to be fucking high energy right now, because what if I don't like it?
[04:16.65]Low energy.
[04:20.84]Oh, shit, I forgot to get my extender.
[04:22.38]Hold on.
[04:22.70]Where's my extender?
[04:25.84]No, no, this is a big problem.
[04:27.94]Where's my extender?
[04:31.54]This is a major problem.
[04:33.00]I can't start without this.
[04:34.02]I need my extension for my headphone.
[04:39.20]Oh, wait, this is bad.
[04:40.55]Uh-oh.
[04:42.23]It's bad.
[04:44.53]Why is it not plugged in?
[04:45.49]And where is it?
[04:49.31]You're gonna understand why I need this.
[04:50.85]Because I'm gonna have to build it all stream.
[04:52.49]Where is it?
[04:57.12]Extender!
[05:01.68]I... Thank god.
[05:03.74]Stream saved.
[05:06.06]God, I would have taken a fucking week off.
[05:08.44]Alright, we got it.
[05:10.28]So we're gonna play... Sorry.
[05:12.55]I'm not hitting you there.
[05:14.43]We're going to play Resident Evil 3 Remake.
[05:26.70]I think I'll stream for a little while.
[05:30.28]And the goal, by the way, is to try to beat this in one stream.
[05:32.20]If I can't beat this in one stream within the next six to seven hours, then... I'll just YouTube the rest.
[05:41.78]Kidding.
[05:43.49]Alright, that's fine.
[05:44.53]That works.
[05:44.97]Good.
[05:45.39]Good.
[05:45.73]My extender is in.
[05:46.43]Alright, let's go.
[05:48.13]Are you ready?
[05:52.31]I don't think you guys are ready for Resident Evil 3.
[05:53.69]Did I hype you guys up?
[05:57.44]I mean, you've probably played this game three times now.
[06:01.04]I haven't.
[06:01.34]Alright, let's go.
[06:06.56]I know, I know, I know.
[06:07.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:08.14]I know.
[06:08.72]It's a fucking scary game.
[06:13.25]By the way, worst hair arc ever.
[06:15.62]I just have to accept it.
[06:16.66]This is just worst hair arc.
[06:20.16]Every day is worst hair 2020.
[06:22.80]But as long as I stay like this, I could look fine.
[06:28.37]Once I turn this way, will you see the real damage?
[06:32.53]See the real damage of this hair?
[06:36.41]We'll just stay this way for now.
[06:38.79]Alright, let's go.
[06:39.36]New game.
[06:41.55]Nope.
[06:42.03]Sorry.
[06:42.45]Not going to happen.
[06:43.01]Don't care.
[06:44.99]I'm not going to play unassisted.
[06:46.45]I'm going to play on standard.
[06:47.29]I'm just going to play regular mode.
[06:49.51]I know I get bullied into picking the hardest mode in every game.
[06:52.77]That's not going to happen.
[06:53.65]I'm not even going to say it.
[06:54.47]I don't even want to know what it says.
[07:01.49]I saw stronger enemies.
[07:02.37]No.
[07:02.43]I don't care.
[07:06.75]Alright, everybody shut up.
[07:08.62]Cutscene!
[07:10.71]Wait, is this real?
[07:12.79]This is... It's an FMV!
[07:13.83]What the... What?
[07:14.25]Our officials can't stay.
[07:36.89]Why did that happen?
[07:37.63]Matt Gorkas.
[07:38.21]I feel like they bought that on Fiverr.
[08:05.80]I'll say anything you want dressed up as an Umbrella employee.
[08:11.34]All we need is a happy birthday Larry at the end of that.
[08:13.62]Turn it up?
[08:25.89]You got it.
[08:26.95]After the cutscene.
[08:27.43]Does this game suck?
[08:32.21]Hey CODs, thanks for the $50 CODs.
[08:37.93]5,000 bits from cards.
[08:39.11]Take these and shave your Lego hair with them.
[08:42.53]I'm gonna.
[08:43.57]I'm gonna have a new haircut.
[08:44.73]Alright, I have to pay attention.
[08:54.44]Thanks for the $50, though.
[08:55.30]That's a fucking huge amount of money.
[08:56.40]Here we go.
[08:56.72]This game sucks.
[09:02.03]For what?
[09:08.05]No?
[09:08.29]Okay.
[09:08.45]Alright, I have to pay attention.
[09:11.81]Pay attention.
[09:12.27]It's not Resident Evil 2.
[09:13.31]Pay attention.
[09:14.65]I get yelled at for this all the time.
[09:15.93]Okay, rain.
[09:18.86]Is this first... Is this first person?
[09:23.74]Why is the FOV so close?
[09:25.14]I don't like this.
[09:25.90]Wow, is this supposed to be third person?
[09:27.04]Is my camera broken?
[09:28.02]Okay.
[09:30.60]Okay.
[09:36.52]I'm too close.
[09:37.34]I don't like this.
[09:38.20]Alright, get me out of this as soon as possible.
[09:40.38]I don't care about any lords.
[09:43.52]Nothing but 60 FOV.
[09:53.65]It's 40.
[09:53.97]Oh, here it goes.
[09:58.71]Right?
[09:59.93]Wait, who is that?
[10:03.12]Who's the character in this one?
[10:05.60]Am I gonna brush my teeth with a gun?
[10:07.02]I don't think that's a good idea.
[10:22.14]Can't trust the tap water.
[10:23.40]I'm telling you.
[10:36.45]What's going on?
[10:37.51]Why is this happening?
[10:38.81]If it was a dream and rip up, you're waking up.
[10:45.64]They're all gonna brush your teeth after all that.
[10:49.74]That's not how you brush your teeth.
[10:57.41]I told you it was a dream.
[11:03.43]Aim over.
[11:06.99]Subtitles they're on no no more fucking first-person oh Look at that dog oh Alright, let's go three more days, then I can kiss this town goodbye oh
[11:38.76]Okay, good.
[11:45.68]What's the way to avoid getting sick by this?
[11:47.66]You look at the ground, right?
[11:48.84]No, that makes it worse.
[11:50.76]Close one eye?
[11:51.94]How do you not get sick by the first person?
[11:59.40]Close both eyes.
[12:01.16]Somebody's...
[12:03.76]ArnoldFantasy12, Hanello, thanks for the five, was it five?
[12:07.60]Five community subs, I almost missed it.
[12:09.10]Thanks for the five subs.
[12:11.56]Open the fucking door.
[12:12.24]Yeah, because then your depth perception doesn't kick in.
[12:20.76]We all know what's going to happen, we just have to be ready for it, right?
[12:26.54]Satan face.
[12:27.08]Into the mirror.
[12:28.74]It's classic.
[12:51.04]Okay.
[12:53.18]Satan.
[12:55.59]No.
[12:55.97]September 28th, 8.07pm, Raccoon City.
[12:58.59]Eddie the Penguin!
[12:59.53]Thanks for the... What was it?
[13:01.17]Five community subs.
[13:01.95]Alright, let's get the controls down.
[13:07.33]It's too dark.
[13:13.06]Wait, what's this?
[13:16.56]Gil's report.
[13:18.77]This has already been two months since that mess with Umbrella.
[13:21.25]Thanks to the suspension, investigations haven't progressed exactly as I'd hoped.
[13:24.69]Perhaps this written record of what I found will prove the final duty of Starr as officer.
[13:29.77]I can only hope that it helps it.
[13:31.82]Those infected by the virus seem to become literal zombies.
[13:34.66]They bite you, they get in contact with you, and they are strong.
[13:38.68]It should be noted that those who survived the incident have not yet developed symptoms.
[13:41.88]It's unclear whether this is because the virus has a long incubation period or because we just happen to be resistant to the infection.
[13:47.19]We ought to remain vigilant.
[13:49.11]As for me, aside from my minor difficulties, skip all lore.
[13:51.97]Are we okay with that?
[13:55.41]Skip all lore?
[13:56.37]Like, you guys are alright with that, right?
[13:59.27]I don't want to read this.
[14:00.59]Like, we all know what happens.
[14:03.91]I mean, do I need to read every memo?
[14:08.61]The game will last two hours if I don't do this.
[14:13.83]What do you mean?
[14:16.24]This lighting makes me look fucking, like, way grosser than I am in real life.
[14:21.42]Whatever.
[14:21.76]Wasn't somebody just calling?
[14:24.22]Pharmaceuticals Company industry leader.
[14:28.98]Yeah, well, it's gonna be a two-hour game.
[14:33.51]They're very patient.
[14:38.25]Turn the lights off.
[14:39.75]It's the daytime here!
[14:42.77]It's daytime.
[14:43.29]That would have scared me.
[14:44.49]I wasn't even looking.
[14:45.39]I was looking at the chatroom.
[14:46.95]That would have been horrifying.
[14:48.19]Is that his nemesis?
[15:12.65]Oh, silly girl.
[15:14.07]You think you can kill me with a mere toothbrush?
[15:17.43]Fuck.
[15:17.79]Close it.
[15:24.75]What the hell is that thing?
[15:32.10]Oh, just missed.
[15:39.60]Holy shit.
[15:40.58]You are strong.
[15:41.64]I couldn't do that.
[15:43.83]I gotta get out of here.
[15:46.11]How do you jump?
[15:54.61]Help him!
[16:00.34]Help this guy!
[16:01.04]Somebody catch him!
[16:03.86]I tried.
[16:18.71]Is there a dodge roll in this one?
[16:25.20]When do I get to go tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-
[16:49.43]They can only go up from here.
[16:56.48]I just got out of there, man.
[17:06.56]I gotta say... Wait, I have a... I'm playing as Nemesis now.
[17:16.03]That's what you guys don't understand.
[17:19.61]Wow, is he pretending?
[17:20.59]He can't even fucking get close to... Wow, she's running so slow, Jerma.
[17:23.35]You suck.
[17:25.41]Fucking... It was scripted.
[17:31.36]She's in a slow, old lady jog.
[17:33.48]You can't even catch up to her?
[17:34.84]You missed three times.
[17:35.80]Fucking awful.
[17:37.68]Alright, which one of these is the main character that's gonna break into song?
[17:48.12]That was a great play we just watched.
[17:49.62]Oh, it's Brad.
[17:51.50]I know Brad.
[17:52.28]It's the helicopter guy.
[17:53.48]Are you Brad?
[17:54.04]This is actually Brad.
[18:11.86]You wanna know something really, really sad?
[18:21.73]This is not making this up.
[18:24.92]Brad was my favorite character in Resident Evil.
[18:28.92]That's really embarrassing.
[18:31.30]Because it was just... He...
[18:41.26]It's not a joke.
[18:41.86]I swear to God.
[18:44.87]I just thought it was cool.
[18:45.85]He's like the helicopter pilot.
[18:47.05]He like saves everybody and rescues them and stuff.
[18:54.69]Did I really just get bit?
[18:55.53]It's scripted.
[19:05.50]I didn't even make it 10 seconds into getting control of the character.
[19:10.36]It's scripted.
[19:21.85]That's what would really happen though, let's be honest.
[19:25.74]Everybody has like this fantasy of what would happen.
[19:28.04]That.
[19:29.48]That.
[19:31.00]Alright, I'm good.
[19:44.11]Nice, Brad.
[19:55.65]Yeah, Brad.
[19:56.03]We all, yeah, we do, actually.
[19:57.77]All of us do.
[19:58.13]Everybody knows what happened.
[19:59.81]Sorry, Brad, but you just, you're dead.
[20:01.03]Ooh.
[20:33.53]This is how you aim.
[20:35.39]A toothbrush.
[20:36.25]I didn't want to say it.
[20:37.24]Is it toggle?
[20:38.88]It's not.
[20:42.22]Feels pretty good.
[20:46.82]Out of bullets.
[20:47.50]Oh no, what do I do?
[20:48.12]That was wasting ammo?
[20:53.56]That was teaching me how to shoot.
[20:54.58]Under the bus.
[20:59.13]Up here.
[21:02.31]Under.
[21:04.00]Oh, right.
[21:04.54]I'm gonna sneeze.
[21:08.98]Nothing I can do about it.
[21:21.11]I tried to fucking help you.
[21:26.93]My chair just got electrocuted.
[21:31.78]-2.
[21:33.06]Oh, sorry Don't run It's gonna be a zombie in it
[21:59.05]Sir, what's your name?
[22:00.39]I can't just leave you behind.
[22:02.07]It's Dario Rosso.
[22:04.90]And yeah, right.
[22:06.56]You just want to steal my safe house.
[22:09.30]Get your own, Missy.
[22:11.30]Missy?
[22:11.94]Hey, any food in there?
[22:13.80]No.
[22:17.98]It's just a big steel box.
[22:20.24]Oh, have fun.
[22:22.39]Get guy in 20 minutes.
[22:29.10]that fucking guy's gonna get hungry in like 30 minutes and go out and venture to go find like a hamburger wrapper and get fucking killed that's how it always happens always have at least on you at all times at least 50 of those fucking cheese snack gift things with the crackers and the little stick that you spread the cheese on they'll last at least three or four months with those what are those things called
[23:00.22]Was it gross?
[23:02.36]I don't think so.
[23:05.10]Why?
[23:08.57]Why is that gross?
[23:10.49]It's cheese and protein.
[23:13.77]And crackers to keep you going.
[23:17.23]And a stick you can use as a weapon against those fucking zombies.
[23:29.63]It's a scripted bike.
[23:33.29]Okay, we're going to our roof.
[23:50.62]I lost the tutorial.
[23:54.96]I don't know if I did earlier.
[24:08.73]I don't have a map yet right now.
[24:10.61]Get that eventually.
[24:24.30]Well, that's not gonna work out.
[24:27.08]Why is it always the helicopter that it happens to, you know?
[24:33.19]The helicopter always gets shot out of the air with a fucking rocket.
[24:41.10]Die!
[24:41.60]Is this a faux letter grade?
[24:43.02]It has to start first.
[24:43.84]It started.
[24:46.17]Okay.
[24:46.57]It started.
[24:58.09]Why would you drive into him?
[25:00.32]Of all the places to drive, you don't drive at the mutant.
[25:06.00]Turret, go down at the exit.
[25:07.66]Why would you drive into him?
[25:16.69]You could have probably gotten out, but no.
[25:18.27]Oh, I'm gonna kill the guy that weighs probably more than the car.
[25:24.68]You were probably better off running into him yourself, which is your body.
[25:51.25]Sorry, it didn't work.
[25:52.01]He's not a helicopter.
[25:53.25]It only hits helicopters.
[26:09.70]I'm actually surprised that that rocket didn't fucking swing around 360 degrees.
[26:14.17]Go the other way and home onto a fucking regular helicopter in the air.
[26:22.70]I think we're in the clear.
[26:24.94]Hope so.
[26:26.84]We've been bringing survivors here.
[26:28.72]Here where?
[26:30.71]I could do that.
[26:32.71]That's my shower.
[26:35.15]That's what that hair looks like after the shower.
[26:38.11]I'm fine.
[26:39.67]Personal space.
[26:40.85]Okay, I get it.
[26:42.73]Let's go.
[26:44.19]Should I go take a shower and come back and have that hair?
[26:46.58]Who's the dipshit that closed this?
[26:49.30]Sorry, we're going to have to go around.
[26:52.40]Hey, do you have any bullets?
[27:00.03]I'll tell you.
[27:02.35]When Nemesis becomes an actual problem in the game, it's going to be... It kind of really... Yeah, that happens though.
[27:09.51]What, are they going to save that?
[27:11.33]Are you kidding me?
[27:16.83]Are you fucking kidding me?
[27:18.33]He doesn't show up again?
[27:20.05]What are you talking about?
[27:23.06]Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?
[27:27.49]Even he was surprised.
[27:36.19]Wait, wait, hold on.
[27:36.79]Nemesis ain't in the game?
[27:37.73]What the fuck are you talking about?
[27:39.06]Wait, what?
[27:39.82]He doesn't show up again?
[27:40.60]Are they... Is this a debate or what the hell?
[27:45.12]That's kind of...
[27:52.01]We both have the same idea.
[27:53.01]Alright, let's go.
[27:53.87]Is there any bullets?
[27:56.99]Check every area.
[27:57.89]Come on, stretch gameplay.
[28:01.73]Stretch gameplay an extra hour so I don't have a three and a half hour stream.
[28:06.83]This fine young lady could use our help.
[28:12.60]Carlos, you didn't even think to ask fine young lady your name?
[28:19.80]She is an elite operative of RPD, Special Tactics and Rescue Service.
[28:26.64]Her name is something Valentine.
[28:31.22]It's Jill.
[28:33.48]Nice to meet you, Jill.
[28:37.91]I am UBCS, Platoon Leader Mikhail Viktor.
[28:41.71]My team was sent here to rescue civilians.
[28:47.31]Right.
[28:49.32]How's that going for you?
[28:50.86]This city is completely cut off.
[28:53.52]Isolated.
[28:55.28]Most of the hundred thousand civilians will wind up dead.
[28:59.77]Correction, undead.
[29:04.05]My platoon has suffered serious losses.
[29:07.69]It's a cutscene.
[29:08.97]You don't need me here.
[29:10.04]I have nothing to do with this.
[29:11.58]Well, you can thank your corporate overlords for that.
[29:14.84]Yes.
[29:16.10]Well, we are doing all we can.
[29:19.41]If we can get this subway train moving, we can... You guys just have to write game on when we get to a gameplay portion and it turns it back on.
[29:29.26]My men cannot do this alone.
[29:37.25]Alright.
[29:39.99]I'm in.
[29:42.03]But I am on their side.
[29:43.51]It's a pre-recorded cutscene.
[29:44.95]Yeah.
[29:45.47]They're not actors doing this in my living room right now.
[29:48.23]Oh god.
[29:48.73]Yeah, of course it is.
[29:49.65]It's a video game.
[29:50.48]It's not real.
[29:51.08]Okay.
[29:51.82]Activated the game on camera.
[30:15.13]Alright, let's get to the street level.
[30:16.23]Is there a... Oh, there is a map.
[30:18.25]The map screen is useful for more than just your current location and surroundings.
[30:22.35]It can also show you any points of interest and items you have found but haven't picked up yet.
[30:26.80]Okay.
[30:29.94]Three points of interest, items you have found but you haven't gotten.
[30:33.92]Alright, so we just gotta get up to street level.
[30:37.72]Okay.
[30:37.96]Go up to street level.
[30:39.36]This is my... Oh.
[30:40.30]Okay.
[30:42.65]Knife.
[30:42.89]Handgun.
[30:43.29]Handgun.
[30:45.97]Now, what about these NPCs over here?
[30:49.07]Nothing?
[30:52.45]Okay.
[30:54.23]Straight level.
[30:56.02]Let's go up.
[30:59.50]I can't stand this hair.
[31:03.02]I can't stand this dude's hair.
[31:05.16]It could be a brand new viewer that came in and talking about me or a long-term viewer that hates this game.
[31:22.38]Okay, I gotta ask a question.
[31:25.04]For those of us idiots in the audience.
[31:27.88]Good, I was gonna say, does it highlight things or do I have to physically go look around?
[31:31.02]Okay, tabloid front page.
[31:36.29]There are cannibals eating people.
[31:38.19]Thousands of bite marks covered her body when she was dismembered.
[31:42.07]Okay, and people ask, how the fuck does he read the one comment?
[31:48.12]Why does he read that one fucking gross messed up comment?
[31:52.58]I don't know.
[31:55.72]Who did it?
[31:56.08]Uh, I don't know.
[31:58.32]It's just... Lower veto.
[32:01.75]I... Half of you are not going to like that.
[32:05.79]Restore power.
[32:08.15]Restore power.
[32:22.88]Copy that.
[32:23.64]Let's do this fast.
[32:25.54]Okay.
[32:25.94]Reactivate power at the substation.
[32:27.26]You got it.
[32:28.84]What's the quick knife?
[32:33.06]What's the quick knife?
[32:33.92]Okay.
[32:38.28]Is it F?
[32:40.25]Quick knife is F. It's not.
[32:43.85]Is there a quick knife?
[32:44.91]Or do I actually have to have it equipped?
[32:50.47]F. There isn't one.
[32:51.49]It's a rare herb.
[32:57.57]What?
[32:57.69]Oh, this is locked.
[32:59.49]What the fuck?
[33:00.25]You're gonna give me a locked chest in the very beginning of the game?
[33:02.63]Oh, this is fantastic, because when I get the key for that in four hours, I have to remember where this is.
[33:08.11]Wait, no, it's a simple lock.
[33:09.07]What does that mean?
[33:10.19]I shoot it off?
[33:12.02]Wait.
[33:14.70]Why am I pressing F?
[33:21.48]I have to shoot it off.
[33:26.85]Anything else?
[33:27.25]No?
[33:27.52]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33:28.98]Okay, there's gunpowder over here.
[33:31.62]Uh, you combine two of these and you make what?
[33:35.34]I almost just walked by all this shit.
[33:37.10]Okay, what is it?
[33:44.43]Some items can be combined with evil.
[33:45.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:46.57]Resident Evil is a video game that we maybe have heard of.
[33:49.17]Uh, okay.
[33:51.65]Use the plus to combine and the command to just, okay, combine.
[33:59.05]Double herb.
[34:02.11]This is standard grade.
[34:03.03]To combine two, you need to create handgun ammo.
[34:04.57]It wants me to do that.
[34:05.85]15 ammo.
[34:09.98]Oh, come on.
[34:10.60]Was this supposed to be a remake?
[34:12.18]I can't just instantly do it in the menu?
[34:13.60]Everybody needs to fix his graphics.
[34:22.33]What's wrong with the... What's wrong with the... What do you mean?
[34:27.31]What's wrong with the graphics?
[34:28.59]Something wrong with the graphics?
[34:34.42]Grainy?
[34:38.70]Your camera is grainy.
[34:44.00]It's grainy.
[34:44.68]It's a sandpaper game.
[34:52.26]Is that... I think... Turn on... Turn off the film grain.
[34:57.13]By the way, where's that?
[34:58.43]I did this, I didn't see that.
[35:13.07]Which one?
[35:14.86]Subsurface, subsurface film grain?
[35:20.14]That'll quality, I got things on medium, okay?
[35:22.48]I don't, mesh quality high?
[35:29.39]I just, I always put things on medium because I want to be able to stream them at 60 FPS.
[35:33.33]My PC, I got a 1080 in here.
[35:34.73]I, look, I know I could, look, I'm going to get about, I'm going to get another PC soon.
[35:39.03]I'll get a fucking 2080 RTX, whatever it is.
[35:41.96]But for now, I do, I want to be able to play at like 120.
[35:44.58]What if I can't play at 120 though?
[35:49.24]Look, see, 120 Hertz.
[35:49.64]He's on an i3.
[35:49.98]No, this is like all good.
[36:00.93]High quality lights?
[36:01.79]I hate high quality lights.
[36:02.89]Ambient occlusion on?
[36:05.48]I hate ambient occlusion.
[36:06.74]It makes it ugly.
[36:08.02]I don't want... You want bloom?
[36:10.28]No, bloom... You want to talk about blur.
[36:14.86]Lens flare?
[36:15.70]Yeah, I want that.
[36:16.78]No, I don't want that.
[36:17.71]This is like the Counter-Strike settings.
[36:19.07]You put everything on low so you can see what the fuck you're doing.
[36:21.03]Okay, put it on.
[36:27.51]This is the Counter-Strike Pro way to play these games, and that's how I do it.
[36:31.38]bloom back on.
[36:31.98]I don't want it on.
[36:32.72]I don't want depth of field on.
[36:33.84]There's extra blur.
[36:34.76]This one just distorts your eyes.
[36:36.16]Alright, and I increased it.
[36:41.63]It looks better.
[36:42.07]I increased it.
[36:46.83]Alright, how about this?
[36:48.55]I'll turn on... What if we do rendering mode super?
[36:52.78]No, that's interlaced.
[36:55.50]Oh, yuck.
[36:57.46]I got anti-aliasing on.
[37:00.59]Bottom most option.
[37:01.63]Upscaling off.
[37:07.42]FidelityFX CAS plus upscaling.
[37:11.16]What is that?
[37:19.51]Turn it off?
[37:21.63]Why are you so scuffed?
[37:23.39]I'm not.
[37:23.93]I'm just trying to figure... Let's see what you tell me.
[37:31.20]Better?
[37:37.99]Use more anti-aliasing.
[37:42.49]This looks like it's on the Nintendo DS.
[37:47.67]Image quality.
[37:48.70]Rendering mode.
[37:49.22]Normal.
[37:50.00]100%.
[37:50.50]Frame rate.
[37:51.02]Variable.
[37:51.58]VSync.
[37:52.16]Off.
[37:52.50]Anti-aliasing.
[37:55.26]TAA?
[37:56.42]FXAA?
[37:57.06]NTSA?
[37:58.74]SMAA?
[37:59.32]Whatever it is.
[38:05.32]The TSA.
[38:07.66]Use SMAA.
[38:08.66]Okay?
[38:10.00]Texture quality.
[38:10.56]Let's put it on higher than that, I guess.
[38:13.79]Texture filter.
[38:15.31]Filter on 16.
[38:15.83]My computer's not going to be... My computer's going to break.
[38:18.01]Good?
[38:18.13]Good?
[38:37.90]Hold on.
[38:38.36]This is green.
[38:40.62]High potency.
[38:41.86]Yeah, green herb is two.
[38:42.74]Green herb and red herb.
[38:43.53]Yeah, maximum potency.
[38:44.97]Wait, this is one green and one red?
[38:47.37]What about the blue?
[38:50.93]Oh, they deleted blue from the remake, right?
[39:01.22]Please make your resolution 480p.
[39:02.44]I don't know what the fuck you guys are on about.
[39:07.18]Alright, let's go.
[39:10.93]Here's the storage unit.
[39:13.27]I'm going to keep this stuff for now.
[39:14.42]Let's make a save file.
[39:17.46]It's the frames.
[39:21.08]I mean the frames.
[39:27.62]Watch it through our eyes.
[39:28.68]Alright, let's figure this out.
[39:39.25]I want to see.
[39:42.77]He's getting upset.
[39:43.59]Alright, put it on fucking source.
[39:51.78]Wait, is this your guy's way to pad the stream?
[39:54.26]Or is this... Pad the stream?
[39:58.69]Or is this... Is it?
[40:02.31]Alright, hold on.
[40:06.25]Is it?
[40:06.45]Alright, hold on.
[40:22.31]What's the problem?
[40:25.91]What's the problem?
[40:29.42]What's the problem?
[40:42.41]I missed another fucking jump scare.
[40:45.43]We've got to get that train moving.
[40:52.63]Quick step.
[40:55.87]It actually looks fine.
[40:57.69]People just try to find ways to, like, make me do some... Wait.
[41:02.49]Turn up the volume.
[41:07.96]It doesn't?
[41:11.30]It's bad?
[41:11.84]If I do it on... If I put it on V-Sync?
[41:19.63]It's the FPS.
[41:21.77]Hold on a minute.
[41:26.43]Where is it?
[41:26.71]Graphics?
[41:27.09]Okay.
[41:29.01]DirectX 12.
[41:30.53]Everyone uses 10 still.
[41:32.37]Variable.
[41:33.27]I'm going to cap it at 60.
[41:34.05]See what happens.
[41:38.91]Is that a variable?
[41:39.67]Is that better?
[41:44.45]It's literally fine.
[41:55.68]Shit.
[41:55.90]I don't want to... Should I save bullets?
[42:02.09]I missed bullets?
[42:05.07]Okay, well, alright.
[42:06.27]The game just looks the way that it looks, alright?
[42:08.35]We're done.
[42:09.49]I'm playing the game.
[42:10.37]I would have been already fucking through this.
[42:28.49]Alright, where do I go?
[42:29.21]This mood is gone.
[42:34.10]Alright, we're going to get the train turned back on.
[42:40.70]Break this.
[42:42.04]That's not how you take off a simple lock!
[42:45.22]Do I actually need a simple key?
[42:46.80]Okay, wait.
[42:54.02]Can I shoot it?
[43:00.32]No, I can't get in here either.
[43:01.78]Fuck.
[43:09.03]I'm gonna keep going.
[43:09.59]I gotta get the subway back on.
[43:12.39]Where the hell do I do that?
[43:18.05]You have to press apply.
[43:19.53]You have to shoot the lock 14 more times.
[43:21.47]I have to pay attention.
[43:23.81]I have to pay fucking attention to this game.
[43:25.29]Otherwise I'm gonna get stuck.
[43:47.81]Okay, reactivate the power.
[43:49.05]Put out the fire!
[43:57.50]Why are you climbing that?
[44:19.14]Okay, I want what's in there.
[44:22.07]Ah!
[44:25.51]Get away from me!
[44:26.45]Come on!
[44:36.66]Gunpowder.
[44:37.17]That's it?
[44:53.30]Fucking red barrel.
[44:54.58]God damn it.
[44:55.12]Can I help that?
[44:59.71]I'm alright.
[45:00.69]Use the knife on the fire.
[45:01.77]There's a generator.
[45:04.81]Okay, I can go this way.
[45:05.93]Let's go over here.
[45:06.91]I can't even see to my left.
[45:13.50]Okay.
[45:17.48]Can I go in here?
[45:21.12]Shit, of course.
[45:24.38]Okay, this is the donut shop.
[45:29.84]They can't open doors, right?
[45:37.82]Nope, need a simple key.
[45:38.82]Let me check the rest of this place.
[45:41.76]Hold on.
[45:46.66]It could be something in here.
[45:52.66]Yep.
[45:53.40]Always explore.
[45:55.10]You never know what you might find.
[45:56.14]That's it.
[45:58.62]Alright, somebody's listening to music back here.
[46:03.58]Alright, I'm ready for whatever's in this door.
[46:15.46]Oh, it's a safe.
[46:18.70]Green herb.
[46:20.13]Fancy box.
[46:23.95]Oh, um, I'm gonna... Alright, cancel.
[46:27.93]I'm gonna take that green herb.
[46:30.93]I need it.
[46:36.26]Pick up that fancy box.
[46:37.26]Take the bullets.
[46:42.20]You can examine an item from different angles by selecting and using the E button.
[46:46.00]You might reveal something that you... Okay, so, pick it up.
[46:48.90]Examine.
[46:49.14]What's in here?
[46:54.93]You know, in a normal circumstance, I would be freaking out right now about that.
[46:57.61]What are you going to get for that now?
[47:01.66]May as well just fucking flush it down the toilet.
[47:06.96]It's just heavy and big and doesn't do anything.
[47:09.72]I mean, you could use it as a weapon.
[47:13.73]Worth nothing now.
[47:16.43]God.
[47:20.55]Take my kids.
[47:23.43]I'm not doing this.
[47:32.67]I was gonna go off on like this really sad rant about how things used to be before I could sell this.

[49:42.39]Alright, well here's the railroad station.
[49:46.81]I don't even fucking think about it.
[49:52.51]Hold on, there might be something else to pick up, like an item or something?
[50:09.27]I'M TRYING TO SHOOT THE FUCKING BARREL!

[50:51.14]Still caution.
[50:51.98]Fuck.
[50:59.73]I thought I was on caution.
[51:00.89]It's okay.
[51:01.19]Alright, I'm out.

[51:52.51]Who's back here?
[51:57.93]Wait.
[51:58.05]I'll have you something up here.
[51:59.75]Should I go up here or should I... The subway's over there.
[52:05.17]Wait, I can just go in this person's house?
[52:22.90]Ooh!
[52:24.82]Need those!
[52:42.36]If I'm gonna push and you're gonna pull at the same time, man, it's not gonna work.
[52:46.18]Oh my god, you fucking dick.
[52:49.22]Alright, I'm really going kind of off path here.
[53:04.77]He's gonna get up, I know it.
[53:05.85]Nothing in the bag.
[53:10.23]Nothing in the bag?
[53:23.63]I need the code for the safe.
[53:38.38]God, it could have been.
[53:40.10]What if they were a fan?
[53:40.92]I don't know.
[53:46.59]Drugstore owner's journal.
[53:49.55]This new hair tonic from Umbrella is flying off the shelves.
[53:52.71]The stuff they make always works wonders.
[53:54.29]It's no surprise.
[53:59.40]The new safe is just perfect.
[54:00.82]Nobody knows the code.
[54:01.82]Not even my wife.
[54:04.14]It's a secret between me and my beautiful Aqua Cure Queen.
[54:08.32]You'd never give it up for a thief.
[54:12.25]Aqua Cure Queen.
[54:15.69]Aqua Cure Queen.
[54:25.93]One shot.
[54:32.03]Alright.
[54:33.05]Just need to make sure he's dead.
[54:39.87]140... 174 milligrams of CBD oil.
[54:41.68]Okay, so I don't know this code.
[54:43.96]Aquacure.
[54:44.54]Where's this going?
[54:48.72]Back out around the side?
[55:02.67]Hello?
[55:03.49]Alright, this brings me... I kind of just want to... I want to get a layout.
[55:06.07]If only there was a pharmacy nearby.
[55:09.75]If only.
[55:11.33]Gosh darn it.
[55:12.11]If only there was a way.
[55:17.20]What's that?
[55:26.10]Get up.
[55:29.82]Warning.
[55:30.44]Keep out.
[55:32.82]On the, uh, scaffolding?
[55:37.38]Ooh.
[55:45.67]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[55:48.63]There's no jump.
[56:12.85]Safe point?
[56:13.79]Oh, I thought there was a typewriter.
[56:15.22]Did I get hurt by that?
[56:22.40]Did I get hurt by that?
[56:29.73]I didn't, right?
[56:30.49]No, not really.
[56:32.63]Gunpowder again.
[56:33.49]Wait, we gotta combine.
[56:36.59]Cancel.
[56:36.91]Combine these two.
[56:40.41]Oh, we got a mixed herb.
[56:46.72]When you were saying G and R, I thought you were telling me to hold those buttons down so I let go of the item.
[56:51.02]Like it's like weapon drop.
[56:54.56]That's what you meant by that.
[56:56.24]Right.
[56:57.06]G plus R. Not like LOL, make him drop his gun.
[57:02.47]Thank you for the help.
[57:03.13]Alright, where we going?
[57:12.23]I've explored everything here.
[57:15.98]If only there was a place called the pharmacy.
[57:18.76]Can I kick this down?
[57:20.70]Hey, found the sh- There it is!
[57:22.88]That's why you explore.
[57:23.98]Now I can get up here.
[57:27.89]He has no faith in us.
[57:31.52]Okay, now.
[57:32.22]If only there was a pharmacy.
[57:36.68]Okay, I'm going to go to the pharmacy.
[57:39.05]Red barrel.
[57:40.53]It's available.
[57:44.33]Good.
[57:46.01]Turns out it was a good thing I didn't shoot it before.
[57:47.86]Okay, we got the donut shop.
[57:53.38]Pharmacy's down.
[57:54.50]That looks like a pharmacy to me.
[57:59.88]God damn it, I went the wrong way.
[58:01.90]I have to go that way.
[58:07.33]Okay, guys, that's the universal symbol for one of two things.
[58:12.17]Drug container or peanut butter.
[58:15.27]I don't think there's a peanut butter store down there.
[58:18.08]That's clearly a drug icon, like a drug container.
[58:22.64]I don't think it's a peanut butter container.
[58:29.13]Alright, drug drug drug drug store drug store
[59:07.64]Save the game.
[59:14.79]I'm going to store.
[59:17.39]How do I want to do?
[59:21.95]I'll get mom's knife.
[59:22.97]I can't believe you let Brad die.
[59:27.19]We got...
[59:28.99]Combine these.
[59:29.77]Can I store the gunpowder?
[59:34.55]Yeah, let's put this away.
[59:35.73]Let's put the jewel away too.
[59:36.91]What the hell do I need this for?
[59:40.98]Taking up space.
[59:43.22]Fuck Brad.
[59:43.84]Fuck Brad.
[59:44.50]Fuck Brad.
[59:47.84]This is better.
[59:53.93]Store the knife.
[59:55.09]Yeah, but I need the knife to slash open boxes.
[60:03.03]Alright, for a second I thought that was game completion.
[60:06.69]And I was like, we're already 20% of the way through the game.
[60:09.43]I was like, that's fucking shocking.
[60:10.96]And then I was like, wait a minute.
[60:12.72]We are 20% of the way through the game.
[60:17.60]That's accurate.
[60:22.86]Okay.
[60:23.93]I'm ready.
[60:25.11]Alright, now we need to put the fire out.
[60:26.73]We gotta get up there.
[60:31.19]More like 30%.
[60:39.12]I need to get a fire extinguisher.
[60:40.44]Hey, I looked over here.
[60:44.50]Let's go down here.
[60:52.36]Red barrel.
[60:54.56]The railway.
[60:55.74]Did I go down this way yet?
[60:59.10]Yeah, let's go to the railway.
[61:01.18]Red barrel.
[61:08.72]It's like I tried to get this fire.
[61:09.98]I was trying to like do like a running back play where I go juke juke juke juke to the left.
[61:14.80]Alright, I made it.
[61:32.75]WASD space.
[61:33.65]Yeah, I know.
[61:34.13]I've been doing it.
[61:34.87]Haven't you seen me go...
[61:50.66]He's behind me, isn't he?
[61:55.88]Nice NA aim.
[61:57.00]I don't wanna go in here yet.
[62:05.62]Fire hose.
[62:11.76]I'm gonna put this in my inventory?
[62:17.43]Wait, hook up the fire hose to the water and spray them.
[62:27.10]Hand grenade.
[62:27.66]Yep.
[62:30.00]Not how these work.
[62:31.66]Gunpowder.
[62:32.32]Okay.
[62:34.88]Why don't you just shoot them in the knees?
[62:39.74]Are you supposed to shoot them in the head?
[62:43.36]When you need to use an item to unlock a door or solve a puzzle, select the item and then select the use command.
[62:49.55]Well.
[62:51.19]I don't think the party horn thing that goes...
[62:57.21]gonna end up doing anything for us so we're gonna go with nothing it might subway employees memo
[63:17.75]Violent's getting worse and worse.
[63:18.81]We've got a shotgun for when it hits a break.
[63:21.07]It's back there.
[63:22.55]Locking it up in the gun rack.
[63:24.35]That should keep it safe from any would-be looters while I go and try to find some more shells.
[63:27.77]If things go south, cut the chain and bust out that sucker.
[63:33.09]I pray we make it out alive.
[63:35.27]We need to cut the chain.
[63:38.57]Cut the chain.
[63:40.99]Don't have that.
[63:43.99]I don't know why.
[63:44.61]Everything is a typewriter.
[63:45.65]That was just a small one.
[63:48.99]Okay.
[63:49.69]Let's go.
[63:53.31]This is a pretty hardcore sandwich shop.
[63:58.30]I just need to get that sucker out of there.
[64:00.68]Are you gonna get up?
[64:06.18]I haven't said it.
[64:07.96]But he's gonna get up.
[64:11.75]This must be the subway company's offices.
[64:14.13]This must be the subway company's offices.
[64:15.67]Okay.
[64:31.40]Everyone hated that.
[64:37.73]Of all the things you guys fucking hate, that?
[64:42.21]That was really rude.
[64:57.69]If I walked in, I would have known it was the subway office, okay?
[65:04.52]Wait, it is a Subway office, right?
[65:06.10]It's a sandwich shop upstairs.
[65:08.08]Wait, hold on a minute.
[65:09.79]It is a Subway shop.
[65:13.07]Wait, is this a sandwich place or is this a railway station?
[65:16.77]Somebody said that.
[65:18.19]You're gaslighting us.
[65:19.19]Sometimes it's fun for me.
[65:25.64]Somebody said, oh, what a hardcore sandwich shop.
[65:28.92]They were talking about, they were making a joke.
[65:32.28]But is it a sandwich shop?
[65:34.22]No, it's not.
[65:48.15]It's... Okay.
[65:54.49]I'm going to put the fire out now.
[65:58.29]Because there's nothing I can do in here.
[66:00.37]I can't, like, turn the machine on.
[66:02.55]I can get points for that.
[66:10.91]Can't open this.
[66:13.16]So, I have to go put out the damn fire.
[66:16.46]He's losing it.
[66:18.46]It was because somebody was like, dude, because in my brain, we passed a sandwich place.
[66:23.10]Well, no, it was like a donut place, right?
[66:24.68]And then for some reason, I thought I was upstairs there, not still in the railroad station, because we may not be in it anymore.
[66:30.95]Alright, I got the hose.
[66:32.81]Let's go.
[66:33.09]Don't laugh thinking that I thought that that was the door.
[66:47.25]Okay, I need to put the fire out.
[66:48.99]We need water.
[66:49.77]See?
[66:50.03]The donut place.
[66:58.05]Where do I get water?
[67:00.45]I gotta put the fire out down here.
[67:02.28]Where is water?
[67:03.56]Do I have to run this?
[67:04.48]Like, do I have to get a bunch of slack and run this?
[67:12.22]Shrunk in... Okay, this is not gonna happen.
[67:13.80]Let's go this way.
[67:15.58]Got no water.
[67:16.22]The water's shopped.
[67:20.62]Can I get down from here?
[67:21.72]No, I... It's right there.
[67:25.29]Alright.
[67:27.49]Anybody see any water?
[67:31.17]It's over there, right?
[67:32.07]Is there like a hose somewhere over here?
[67:35.85]Or like a wall socket for water?
[67:38.07]Wait, what's over here?
[67:38.73]Just wait for it to rain.
[67:43.80]Holy shit.
[67:45.00]How did you guys get up here?
[67:53.15]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[67:56.45]Just use... I gotta get the hell out of here now.
[67:58.25]Like, get me the hell out of here.
[67:59.67]I'm running in circles.
[68:01.62]This is the safe room, right?
[68:02.62]Okay, let me... I gotta burn this into memory that this is where the safe is.
[68:05.32]This is important for me to do.
[68:06.30]Got it.
[68:16.76]Okay, that's the safe... where the safe is.
[68:24.01]Alright, I need to go... I have to go out that way.
[68:26.63]I'm not going this way.
[68:27.45]I'm not going all the way around.
[68:28.33]I need to... I have to just dodge.
[68:30.55]Oh, shoot, if I need to.
[68:31.53]The game has... You have a gun.
[68:33.15]I can use it.
[68:45.98]I'm going to get $50 and I missed it.
[68:49.55]It was Palmer.
[68:50.59]Palmer, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[68:53.61]Sorry I was the one guy for the watch through our eyes.
[68:57.54]Sorry I was the one guy for the watch through our eyes.
[69:00.22]I think my internet is messed up.
[69:01.94]Love the streams.
[69:04.04]Oh, oh, okay.
[69:08.04]We got one guy.
[69:08.88]That was like a long... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[69:13.53]Did I go in the pharmacy?
[69:15.69]Oh, in the pharmacy.
[69:17.33]I did, didn't I?
[69:17.89]Yeah, I did this.
[69:20.79]I've already been in here.
[69:25.04]Go in the pharmacy for what?
[69:29.64]The poster.
[69:33.61]You guys really gotta get your fucking head out of the gutter.
[69:43.23]That's, uh... 937.
[69:56.58]That's the code.
[69:57.58]And guess where that safe is?
[70:02.33]I'm just going to fucking lock it in.
[70:14.29]Nine.
[70:15.67]Now here's the problem.
[70:16.53]I have to remember how to use a safe.
[70:22.38]So it's this way first.
[70:23.68]You go nine.
[70:25.98]Then you pass the 7.
[70:29.31]You do one full rotation, land on 7, and then back to 9.
[70:37.33]Back to 3.
[70:38.33]Back to 3.
[70:38.75]What?
[70:39.37]What was the number?
[70:45.01]9, 3, 7.
[70:47.20]What did I... What did I do?
[70:49.20]Alright, what did I do?
[70:53.32]9... Go over the 3...
[71:00.88]Seven.
[71:11.75]No, that's how you do it.
[71:12.63]That's how you use a safe.
[71:14.53]Don't do a full rotation.
[71:15.73]That's how you open a safe.
[71:18.63]Wait, I forgot this game.
[71:19.83]There's a remake.
[71:22.53]A fucking like 16 to 20 year old crowd don't even know what this is.
[71:26.47]You've never seen a dial like this before.
[71:27.88]Why would they know that?
[71:38.63]Yeah, guys, if you don't know, you actually have to pass the second number in a full rotation when you open a safe.
[71:44.84]Yeah, it's a remake.
[71:49.22]It's a red dot sight.
[71:50.64]Holy shit, really?
[71:52.98]That's not wrong.
[71:53.58]That's actually true.
[71:54.58]That's how you open up a dial.
[71:58.65]Custom part for the handgun.
[72:00.63]Is it on?
[72:00.83]Is it on?
[72:11.93]Nice.
[72:14.27]Oh, there we go.
[72:14.79]I got the first cool unlockable.
[72:19.79]Why does everyone here hate when Jerma is right?
[72:21.55]Because the streamer always has to be wrong.
[72:30.09]I could tell you that it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon right now, and you'd find a way to make it be incorrect.
[72:37.04]You'd figure it out.
[72:44.67]It's 5 11.
[72:46.01]It's 5 12 p.m.
[72:46.47]There you go.
[72:50.58]You've passed the test.
[72:56.46]Uh, I'm gonna go down here.
[72:57.30]Now I got my red dot sight.
[73:02.98]Let's plug that fire hose in.
[73:09.81]Alright.
[73:10.71]Fire hose.
[73:11.15]Just get- just run.
[73:12.03]Just go down.
[73:12.75]Whatever.
[73:13.01]If you gotta shoot somebody, you gotta shoot somebody.
[73:21.59]That like a- probably 60% headshot ratio, I think.
[73:25.21]Maybe a little bit more.
[73:26.81]Okay.
[73:31.23]Where's that fire?
[73:35.39]Is the fire down here?
[73:36.36]Where's that- where's that fire?
[73:46.43]It's down here, isn't it?
[73:56.55]Shit!
[73:59.93]Yeah, that's the other side.
[74:04.23]It's in the pharmacy.
[74:11.21]He's got a jello brain.
[74:16.45]CBT brain.
[74:24.95]Silent Serenity gave 5,000 bits.
[74:27.25]50 more dollars, and they say, thanks for the huge amount of money, first of all.
[74:32.28]Jeremiah, I just wanted to let you know that it's okay to be high.
[74:34.52]I'm high, and I bet 30% of chat is too.
[74:36.44]Gamers unite.
[74:47.49]I cannot speak to the validity of what you just said, but... I'm not even... I'm fucking high.
[74:54.19]Alright, so now I need to go down here.
[74:56.59]Streamer admits to doing drugs.
[75:08.91]Alright, what fire do I need to put out?
[75:12.29]This one?
[75:16.62]Drop something?
[75:21.38]Yep, you did.
[75:21.84]Alright, that looks like a fire engine put out.
[75:26.10]Alright, where's the water hose?
[75:30.22]Fucking stay dead!
[75:37.75]Down here.
[75:38.15]Supermarket can't open.
[75:47.84]What is this little corner thing over here?
[75:49.40]Can I go in this?
[75:58.60]So where is this fire, this supposed fire?
[76:01.36]Put out the fire.
[76:02.72]At the station?
[76:03.54]Like, all the way back to the very beginning.
[76:09.37]To my right.
[76:20.17]There ain't no hose here.
[76:27.61]Yeah, I know.
[76:38.95]Oh.
[76:44.46]By the way, if that was real, you would fly.
[76:46.06]The thing would whip you around.
[76:48.04]Like in a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
[76:53.02]In fact, there's probably been like old comedy movies where that has happened.
[76:56.52]Well, like, Mr. Bean, I, alright.
[76:58.28]Mr. Bean probably has a segment where he's doing a firefighter thing.
[77:01.90]And he flies around when the hose is on full blast.
[77:04.82]Has to be.
[77:09.24]He does.
[77:09.68]Of course he does.
[77:10.60]Why wouldn't he?
[77:16.13]There's the thing to cut the wires.
[77:18.71]He's gonna drip feed me.
[77:21.21]This is bullshit.
[77:23.69]Okay.
[77:32.11]There actually is.
[77:32.89]I would have bet on it.
[77:37.45]Okay, I'm going to store the grenade.
[77:38.73]Keep the gunpowder.
[77:41.31]Keep the heal.
[77:41.83]Keep these.
[77:43.31]No, I don't want to store the knife.
[77:48.88]I have to pee so bad.
[77:49.92]I knew I shouldn't have drank like three of these.
[77:51.34]I'll be right back.
[77:55.68]Very quickly.
[77:56.14]I'm just going to go pee.
[79:45.12]I am back.
[79:45.46]I told you it wouldn't be long.
[79:55.68]Does this game have the... That feature?
[80:01.88]Where... You need to use ribbons?
[80:04.95]Is that what hardcore mode is?
[80:06.51]You need to use ribbons?
[80:07.33]You actually can only save once or something?
[80:09.73]Did they get rid of that?
[80:13.67]Ink ribbons?
[80:17.75]That was a pain in the ass.
[80:20.27]Back in the old games, if you don't know, you could only save the game if you had an item in your inventory.
[80:25.57]There was a finite amount of them in the game.
[80:29.01]It was a pain in the ass.
[80:29.77]I'm glad we never have to see that again.
[80:34.36]Resident Evil 2 Remake has ribbons.
[80:36.82]I thought, yeah, I think so.
[80:37.60]Alright.
[80:40.40]This is good for now.
[80:41.04]I'm gonna use that one bullet.
[80:44.48]Is someone in here?
[80:49.38]Let's open it up.
[80:58.22]I don't know, I'm just paranoid.
[81:03.69]Brad.
[81:04.09]You're UBCS?
[81:05.51]Yeah, careful, careful.
[81:09.71]Come on, don't look at me like that, alright?
[81:11.03]I'm not infected.
[81:12.11]No, no, no, wait, please!
[81:16.81]What the fuck?
[81:18.73]Hey Palmer, thanks for the 10 subs.
[81:20.23]On top of your $50.
[81:20.91]Get a haircut.
[81:48.41]Turn the game off.
[81:49.85]Game off.
[81:50.93]I... Who cares?
[81:52.61]Ooh, shotgun shells.
[81:56.19]I'm running out of room.
[81:56.91]Alright, I need to put these shotgun shells into... What's that?
[82:01.46]Training log.
[82:02.80]Four pages is too many.
[82:03.86]Alright, I've absorbed it.
[82:12.32]Okay, we can go up.
[82:16.84]I don't want to go up.
[82:19.57]I want to go back in here.
[82:20.48]Because why would I keep this with me when I don't have a shotgun?
[82:26.22]Wait a minute, I can cut the... Alright, hold on.
[82:30.98]No, this is alright.
[82:32.20]I'm going to go up and cut the shotgun out, right?
[82:40.27]That sounds like a plan.
[82:44.47]Anybody remember where the hell that was?
[82:47.82]I do not remember where that was.
[82:52.40]Sandwich shop!
[82:53.02]It was in the subway station.
[83:01.33]Remember the person that made the sandwich shop reference?
[83:03.47]Remember they said, this is a hard turn off the film grain.
[83:19.47]There is no film grain.
[83:21.63]What do you want me to do here?
[83:22.70]Particle quality?
[83:29.70]I can't talk to you, whoever you are.
[83:41.79]It doesn't make any sense.
[83:42.87]Go to display.
[83:51.58]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[84:01.07]I don't answer the phone on broadcast.
[84:02.95]Everybody knows that.
[84:03.69]Alright, let me go get the donut shop thing.
[84:11.97]Was it this one?
[84:12.57]Yeah, it was that one.
[84:24.21]When have I ever answered a telephone on stream?
[84:27.77]Alright, is it this way?
[84:28.87]Or down into the donut shop?
[84:31.79]No.
[84:33.35]Where was that shotgun?
[84:36.71]In there?
[84:37.09]I think it's in there, right?
[84:46.92]I think I'm gonna... If I remember...
[84:53.63]There, there's definitely something to cut here though, I know for a fact.
[84:57.58]One of these, yeah, yeah, something's, something's cuttable here.
[85:02.54]Where is it?
[85:03.18]I know something's cuttable in here.
[85:07.60]Shit, something, I know something was cuttable.
[85:14.01]Really?
[85:14.29]No, are you serious?
[85:17.99]Was I actually just wrong?
[85:23.90]Here we go.
[85:26.40]Got it.
[85:26.58]Okay, that's there.
[85:39.13]But... Wait, I'm about to reactivate the fucking power.
[85:44.91]This is progress.
[85:45.85]I don't want to do game progress.
[85:47.73]I want to go get the shotgun.
[85:52.01]What's upstairs?
[85:54.49]Subway.
[85:59.29]Here it is.
[86:03.13]Progress?
[86:04.21]Yeah, I'm getting there.
[86:12.34]Okay, where is that?
[86:13.86]There you are.
[86:16.72]Got it.
[86:23.50]Nice.
[86:25.75]M3 shotgun.
[86:26.83]Find those bullets.
[86:40.93]Give me a shot.
[86:44.55]Okay.
[86:44.95]Four.
[86:48.97]That was a warning shot.
[86:51.59]To who?
[86:53.60]I got the shotgun.
[86:54.38]I'm ready to go.
[86:55.16]I'm ready to go down into that subway.
[87:03.69]I hear shit out here.
[87:04.85]Alright, what's something I can cut in here?
[87:15.33]Nope.
[87:20.15]Just a dumb box.
[87:25.13]Starting to hear things.
[87:27.78]Kind of.
[87:29.18]In the game.
[87:32.22]Stop, you guys.
[87:32.66]I'm making him paranoid.
[87:33.64]Nope.
[87:40.57]I don't want to use the shotgun.
[87:45.53]Okay, anything else?
[87:46.41]Any random... No, I'm good.
[87:48.72]Let's move.
[87:51.57]Red barrel there.
[87:52.95]Big bits.
[87:54.51]Come on.
[87:55.61]This is from YesIsOnline.
[87:57.13]Another $50 in bits.
[87:58.66]That's $5, $10, $15, $20.
[88:00.04]This is $250 in fucking bits.
[88:02.46]In the first hour and ten minutes of this stream.
[88:05.36]Thank you all of you, and thank you YesIsOnline for the $5,000.
[88:08.28]And you say... Glad you're finally getting around to playing this.
[88:32.38]The weekend, it came out.
[88:33.78]I put 40 hours into it.
[88:36.20]And I 100%ed it because I had so much fun.
[88:39.06]That post-game content is based.
[88:45.36]I mean, how?
[88:47.78]What?
[88:47.92]What do you mean?
[88:51.69]How did I do that?
[88:54.29]Being completely aware of every single part of fucking small vapors that are around me.
[89:00.94]Uh, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[89:02.30]I need to reload.
[89:09.20]How many is this?
[89:09.76]Three?
[89:16.94]Okay, we're good.
[89:19.35]Hand grenades.
[89:19.97]Shit.
[89:22.23]And shotgun shells.
[89:23.63]Oh my god, what do I do about this?
[89:31.97]I have to leave this stuff here.
[89:33.03]Alright, back to the box.
[89:38.79]I'm going to get rid of the... Alright, back to the box.
[89:41.71]I'm going to get rid of the... Hold on.
[89:46.67]Pick up the shells.
[89:48.89]Wait.
[89:49.35]Oh, you can... Okay, you can have more than... Alright.
[89:51.92]I don't know why I thought this was a separate stack.
[89:54.08]How much is a stack of shells?
[89:55.04]I thought it was five.
[89:56.34]Probably ten.
[89:57.18]Okay.
[89:58.14]Okay.
[90:00.83]I can't pick up that grenade.
[90:02.45]Is there anything else I can even do back here?
[90:06.07]That was it, huh?
[90:09.43]Besides the grenade.
[90:10.19]Okay.
[90:14.86]I'm gonna go get the grenade.
[90:18.60]Go to the donut shop.
[90:22.80]Dream is not playing the game the way that I want him to.
[90:26.15]No, and I won't.
[90:28.35]You gotta come in here with some expectations.
[90:33.41]Just as I have expectations for what I think the game's going to give me, you've got to have expectations for what you're going to get out of me.
[90:38.06]Okay, let's store the... Get rid of this.
[90:53.33]No, keep that.
[91:01.87]That's gonna come back and bite me in the ass, isn't it?
[91:07.21]Not taking the knife is just... I mean, I'll store this.
[91:18.22]I use it.
[91:19.10]Okay, that's enough slots to get that grenade and then run back here and deliver it.
[91:27.23]Life is worthless.
[91:29.18]Get a vacuum and suck up the zombies.
[91:32.10]Okay, Luigi.
[91:40.20]I'm just going to go straight here.
[91:44.23]Get the grenade.
[91:44.91]Put the grenade in the box.
[91:47.87]And move on with our lives here.
[91:49.55]That's all that's here.
[91:52.31]It's going to be blue.
[91:53.03]Yep.
[91:53.16]Okay.
[92:00.19]-2.
[92:00.67]That was a softball joke.
[92:05.43]They don't have to be home run.
[92:16.66]Okay.
[92:18.14]I'm comfortable with this.
[92:20.74]Now let's look at the map.
[92:23.48]Is something still going?
[92:24.72]The donut shop has this bullshit in it.
[92:26.46]I need a key.
[92:29.28]This still needs to be taken care of somehow.
[92:32.90]Up here.
[92:33.34]Needs to be taken care of.
[92:36.00]And then the subway station needs to be powered.
[92:40.47]Then what the heck's going on over here?
[92:41.89]Go find out.
[92:52.21]So, donut shop I can't finish.
[92:55.01]This I can't finish.
[92:56.05]I'll go take a look, though, just to see what's in here.
[92:59.69]I love this movie.
[93:02.66]Did I miss something over here?
[93:03.56]I don't.
[93:09.68]Is it like a gun or something?
[93:13.79]To look at or do?
[93:14.55]I don't know.
[93:16.51]Alright, well then.
[93:20.27]I'm done with this.
[93:20.97]Unless... There we go.
[93:31.13]Now this area is done.
[93:32.07]Oh, this is gonna fuck with my ADD.
[93:35.37]I'm gonna have to fill all these in blue.
[93:36.85]Okay.
[93:44.21]Reactivate power at the substation.
[93:47.50]But first, go this way.
[93:49.80]There's this shit in this pharmacy, right?
[93:54.04]There's a door I can open.
[94:00.56]It was not.
[94:01.56]Blue.
[94:04.06]Running ADD?
[94:05.02]Die!
[94:22.81]Do not.
[94:23.29]I shot you three times.
[94:26.99]No, don't shoot it with a shotgun pick.
[94:28.53]Get out different.
[94:30.37]I didn't want to use it.
[94:32.53]I switched to the handgun.
[94:35.37]I switched to the... You saw that.
[94:44.70]I can't even pick this fucking thing up.
[94:47.18]Why do I have the knife?
[94:51.45]Why do I have the knife for?
[95:11.17]Okay, blue.
[95:15.47]Keep going.
[95:15.85]Now back to the, uh, the station, right?
[95:17.57]Is there anything else I could do at the station?
[95:33.23]Where's his power?
[95:41.86]I can cut?
[95:42.84]Come to cut.
[95:45.72]Fuck!
[95:46.34]It's not like I can't cut it.
[95:47.44]It's a stupid regular lock.
[95:50.32]Damn it.
[95:51.42]This is where I got the shotgun.
[95:52.43]Right.
[95:54.85]Your forehead's so big.
[95:57.65]It's just the angle of the camera.
[95:59.43]By the way, that means I have a huge fucking brain.
[96:01.17]That means I'm way smarter than you.
[96:03.79]You'll ever be.
[96:04.33]Your brain's so much bigger than yours.
[96:22.10]How do I turn the fucking power on?
[96:23.28]Where's the only place I haven't gone?
[96:37.96]Your forehead's so big.
[96:39.08]Yeah.
[96:39.20]Good.
[96:39.32]I think that's a good trait.
[96:45.22]Alright, I'm gonna go back down this way.
[96:50.25]Shoot it.
[96:51.86]I gotta find a power grid or something.
[96:58.78]Reactivate power at the substation.
[97:02.47]Oh, chain door.
[97:03.09]Alright, let's go.
[97:26.79]Do you want help?
[97:28.87]No, not yet.
[97:29.41]Not yet.
[97:29.73]Don't give it to me yet.
[97:32.33]I will absolutely look over here and go.
[97:33.83]Help me, please.
[97:35.49]Okay.
[97:45.08]Now... There's a chain door over here.
[97:47.98]Help him.
[97:49.36]You don't have to help me.
[97:53.28]Oh, don't help me.
[97:53.92]Don't do it.
[97:54.32]Don't, no, no, no.
[97:54.82]I know where I'm going.
[97:55.52]I'm just trying to find the way there.
[97:56.64]I think there's two chain doors.
[98:11.15]Don't ever help him.
[98:14.61]Well, that's a little mean.
[98:15.77]Okay, here's the first one.
[98:19.89]Alright.
[98:22.38]No, what?
[98:28.33]Don't help me.
[98:28.97]Here we go.
[98:40.88]Help him, please.
[98:41.94]No, I'm good.
[98:42.82]I found it.
[98:43.26]What a fancy box.
[98:51.11]There's another gem in here, isn't there?
[98:53.79]Okay, hold on.
[98:54.35]High grade gunpowder.
[98:58.67]What the fuck do I have right now?
[99:00.31]You can discard items that have served their purpose.
[99:02.58]Or any of the items marked with this trash mark by select trash.
[99:06.40]Oh.
[99:06.52]I don't need it anymore.
[99:08.68]Trash.
[99:12.76]Okay, good.
[99:13.20]Now I'm good to go.
[99:15.57]Discard all items.
[99:24.48]Blue jewel.
[99:25.16]I have a red jewel and a blue jewel.
[99:28.65]Okay.
[99:33.37]Can't pick that up.
[99:34.73]So do I... Am I done with the jewels?
[99:40.02]Hold on.
[99:43.62]Let me... Oh, first aid spray too.
[99:48.19]Shit.
[99:53.48]I gotta go back to the box and store some stuff.
[99:58.55]Where's the nearest box?
[100:00.59]Right here?
[100:00.85]Alright, hold on.
[100:02.59]I'm gonna go get the bolt cutters.
[100:05.31]Turn the light off in my room.
[100:06.65]That's not gonna do anything.
[100:08.39]You're a hoarder.
[100:09.23]Alright, hold on.
[100:11.03]I'm ditching the knife.
[100:11.99]I'm ditching the jewel.
[100:12.97]I'm coming back here.
[100:19.68]I knew he was there!
[100:20.58]I knew he was there.
[100:21.60]I just...
[100:25.82]I knew you were there.
[100:53.56]Come on.
[100:54.30]No.
[100:56.36]I'm trying to... How long is the dodge?
[100:58.28]Does it take a second?
[100:59.57]Let me see.
[100:59.95]You want me to use the knife?
[101:13.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[101:22.93]Oh, there's a green... Alright, hold on.
[101:24.53]Alright, there's a green... Wait a minute.
[101:28.89]Do I... I need to put... There's a green one, too?
[101:33.65]That's how you get the power back to the station.
[101:35.01]You put all the weird shit in there.
[101:36.11]Okay, let's go.
[101:41.70]Throw the grenade.
[101:42.38]Come on.
[101:44.60]Let me... I'm never taking the knife out ever again.
[101:50.24]Okay, so... Um...
[102:05.32]not put the red one in?
[102:06.18]Oh, there we go.
[102:07.66]Alright, put the red one in.
[102:09.46]Am I going to find a green one?
[102:17.46]Discard all ammo and play like a real gamer.
[102:20.46]Tactical shotgun.
[102:22.84]Nice.
[102:25.30]Okay.
[102:28.70]Custom part made for the M3.
[102:29.80]Reduces recoil.
[102:30.62]There we go.
[102:34.15]Upgrade.
[102:36.84]Now I need a green one.
[102:40.68]Hmm.
[102:43.84]This is fine.
[102:46.91]Find the gunpowder.
[102:53.29]Store this.
[102:53.95]There's another high-grade gunpowder in the other store.
[102:58.28]Okay.
[103:02.78]Now, where is the third jewel?
[103:04.82]Right here, probably, somewhere in there.
[103:06.84]Or right here.
[103:07.30]Padlocked door.
[103:12.18]Gunpowder first aid spray padlocked door.
[103:18.11]I don't know.
[103:18.57]I don't have a key or anything.
[103:21.61]Two.
[103:22.03]Simple lock is a monument.
[103:23.69]Typewriter.
[103:24.19]Well, whatever.
[103:29.23]Let's save it.
[103:32.20]I'm gonna go back and get the stuff.
[103:34.06]Am I at caution?
[103:34.92]Yeah.
[103:35.12]Alright, just don't get hit.
[103:39.60]I just have to go this way and just get these couple items and then get the fuck out of here.
[103:44.06]There's a pleb Jupiter?
[103:46.24]Alright.
[103:49.00]Okay.
[103:52.04]What about... Did I already go in this store?
[103:54.22]Can I go in this store?
[103:56.45]I gotta wrap around here.
[104:12.48]I don't know why I even... Okay.
[104:24.49]Now let's get this shit.
[104:27.23]I can make shotgun shells now.
[104:30.51]First aid spray.
[104:31.23]Yep.
[104:33.15]There it is.
[104:34.17]Nothing else in here.
[104:34.97]We are blue.
[104:36.57]Can't open this door.
[104:46.45]Subway control room.
[104:48.48]This way.
[104:50.24]Okay, I got everything I needed.
[104:54.86]The subway control room.
[104:57.78]We gotta go out and back down around.
[105:00.02]This way, right?
[105:05.28]Yep.
[105:09.16]You haven't turned it on.
[105:13.64]Um...
[105:16.67]Isn't that where the control room... Wouldn't there be power in the control room?
[105:21.42]Nonetheless, I haven't gone.
[105:22.18]This needs to be loud?
[105:24.76]Turn it up.
[105:25.16]Turn what up?
[105:31.13]Turn the game, or which one?
[105:33.59]Want me to get closer, like this?
[105:44.93]I'm going to keep going around because I want to go this way.
[105:49.44]This game is too grainy and cringe.
[105:52.44]Sorry.
[105:57.38]Oh, there he is.
[105:58.00]There's the guy that owns this place, right?
[106:03.12]I'm okay.
[106:17.74]Somebody else in here.
[106:18.34]Is somebody else in here?
[106:21.36]No.
[106:23.47]Are there?
[106:25.99]No, I'm losing my mind.
[106:26.89]Okay.
[106:31.83]Down this way to the control room.
[106:36.07]Let's see if I can do this.
[106:40.65]Got one earbud in.
[106:41.80]Yes, he does.
[106:42.28]Okay, so...
[106:47.47]Is this something I didn't do in here yet?
[106:50.73]No.
[107:02.96]Garage?
[107:04.68]No.
[107:04.98]That's the only place...
[107:20.50]It's gonna go that way, I guess.

[108:08.40]Steakums.

[111:39.45]And you can just do that.
[111:40.67]Why do I have a knife?
[111:41.37]It's just a slot.
[111:43.51]It's shit that takes up a slot.
[111:44.67]Alright, we're at the generator.
[111:59.06]Somebody's sprinting!
[111:59.70]Alright, I'm running out of ammo.
[112:18.23]Okay, now I can take a look around.

[113:04.32]Axe from substation chief.
[113:06.23]While employees, in response to the violent outbreaks across the city, we have implemented an intentional power outage.
[113:11.99]Once the situation has been brought under control, please activate the four breakers.
[113:15.65]Once that's done, turn on the main power switch.
[113:20.65]Alright.
[113:20.93]Turn them on.
[113:31.46]Intentional power outage.
[113:35.49]Alright, let's store... I'm going to store this.
[113:42.49]Wait, I can combine this.
[113:46.88]Make some shells, right?
[113:50.86]Oh, wait a minute.
[113:51.34]Should I make shotgun shells or should I make mag ammo?
[113:58.44]Magazine.
[114:02.33]And store it.
[114:07.17]I like shotguns.
[114:16.48]Magazine?
[114:23.00]Ag ammo.
[114:27.04]Oh, it's for a magnum.
[114:28.62]Right.
[114:30.29]Well, I want to kill the last boss in like 30 seconds.
[114:33.81]So I'm going to store like 50 of those.
[114:36.21]Okay, put the ammo out.
[114:39.79]Okay, that's good for now.
[114:43.63]Permanent pog.
[114:48.41]Oh, thank goodness.
[114:49.31]I was going to say, hopefully that's in this game.
[114:51.27]I was about to be like, please God, let me have this.
[114:53.99]Okay.
[114:55.61]Let's go.
[114:59.18]How do I make a second pile?
[115:01.58]Irma Poggers.
[115:02.78]Coffee Poggers.
[115:03.68]Cheetos Poggers.
[115:04.90]Chicken Poggers.
[115:09.20]Chicken Poggers sounds like... Chicken nuggets.
[115:13.88]But it's like... Like 30% rat meat.
[115:18.24]Like... I don't know if I would eat chicken Poggers if I were you guys.
[115:21.84]Alright, how do I turn these on?
[115:30.23]Turn on the four switches.
[115:31.09]Do I have to actually go down there and do this?
[115:44.40]Okay.
[115:46.20]Okay.
[115:46.63]Alright, I got plenty of ammo.
[115:55.07]This is a boss.
[115:56.63]Isn't it?
[115:58.54]Yeah, it's gonna be the green herbs.
[116:00.40]They work.
[116:00.88]Starting to look like Chad was never gonna come back from his rounds, so I poked my head in there, and fuck me, next thing I know, I've got some kind of maggot squirming down my throat.
[116:10.64]I was gagging and heaving, but those little bastards didn't seem to mind none.
[116:14.22]They just wouldn't come up.
[116:15.14]I was staggering around like a madman, then I saw it.
[116:17.56]A green herb.
[116:19.16]My grandma once told me that green herbs are a natural bug deterrent.
[116:22.76]I grabbed one, shoved it down my gob, and swallowed.
[116:25.68]And what do you know?
[116:26.20]The little things didn't want to be in there anymore.
[116:29.09]They've been so happy to throw up.
[116:30.25]I'm going to head back out there to look for Chad.
[116:32.55]Anybody who sees this, eat your greens.
[116:34.29]Okay.
[116:42.57]Should I combine these, or should I keep it out just like that?
[116:45.50]And rub them in my mouth and stuff?
[116:48.36]I need to.
[116:49.38]During this absolute boss fight.
[116:55.78]Can't get in here.
[116:56.96]Yeah, that'd be nice.
[116:59.98]Internal memo.
[117:02.90]Key to the high voltage area has gone missing and the earliest we'll be able to get a replacement in the next week.
[117:08.61]A lockpick will be provided to the senior employee on duty.
[117:13.19]Only have one lockpick and can't afford to lose it.
[117:15.33]Please keep it in its carrying case.
[117:17.05]Okay.
[117:22.89]Find the lockpick.
[117:25.65]Betcha it's gonna be down here.
[117:28.47]I wonder if that's a lockpick.
[117:33.13]Well, you guarded it with your life.
[117:34.27]If he grabs me, I'm gonna be mad because I pre-shot him.
[117:48.65]Ugh.
[117:59.70]I hated it.
[118:00.66]Okay.
[118:02.18]Open it.
[118:04.08]Looks like a special made case for some kind of tool.
[118:05.90]Something's inside.
[118:07.00]Open it.
[118:10.82]Okay.
[118:11.18]There's a bunch of locked doors and shit back in the other area.
[118:14.83]Why do I have to go back and do those?
[118:26.97]There's probably stuff in them.
[118:31.95]Backtracking Andy.
[118:35.09]What do you do in this game?
[118:37.43]I'm gonna go at least get a couple of them.
[118:39.01]Because... Why would I not?
[118:41.21]There's just free shit in there.
[118:43.05]Gotta remember where they are.
[118:44.27]Credit cringe.
[118:50.13]Keanu Reeves.
[118:51.37]What?
[118:51.53]Okay, there's one right here.
[118:54.55]I remember walking by it.
[118:57.39]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[119:01.05]Where is it?
[119:02.87]I'm gonna store some of this stuff for now.
[119:11.38]Just in case I find some cool stuff.
[119:18.56]Okay.
[119:22.07]Backtracking Brad.
[119:24.85]What a mega wholesome pupper.
[119:36.10]Yeah, I want to get these items.
[119:38.66]I don't want to be a fucking dope and not get the items I need.
[119:42.02]I need to get stuff.
[119:43.96]I'm going to be so underprepared for the next area if I don't get some stuff.
[119:50.91]Let's check it out.
[119:57.27]Look, there's one right here.
[119:58.05]Hawkpick.
[120:06.12]This is a minigame?
[120:06.86]Okay, thank god.
[120:07.88]Handgun ammo.
[120:11.16]Perfect.
[120:13.30]Cool.
[120:13.66]Combine.
[120:17.20]Gunpowder.
[120:18.04]Yeah, this is why I need to do this.
[120:22.39]Be clear.
[120:23.25]Yep.
[120:23.53]Alright, let's keep going.
[120:24.37]Let's go back a little bit more.
[120:27.43]Out here, there's one over this way.
[120:34.57]out this way.
[120:37.07]I just want to get this one.
[120:48.39]What's with the guy?
[120:49.51]Is somebody in jail?
[120:50.67]That's a crazy emote combination.
[120:52.41]What the fuck?
[120:54.30]That's insane.
[120:55.10]Okay.
[120:56.86]Let's keep going.
[120:57.90]I need to go this way.
[121:02.20]Right?
[121:02.52]Alright.
[121:02.82]I just want to open that one door.
[121:06.55]And then we're just going to keep going.
[121:09.21]I know, why am I going all the way back?
[121:10.49]But, like, it's... Fuck.
[121:13.61]It's like shit I can open.
[121:21.20]Okay, like, there's one right here.
[121:27.82]You're padding the game.
[121:30.11]Whatever.
[121:30.47]First aid spray.
[121:31.95]That's a huge deal.
[121:32.89]Alright, store it.
[121:39.01]Store this, too.
[121:41.64]Wait, no.
[121:42.30]Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[121:43.58]Keep them.
[121:43.98]I don't need it right now.
[121:44.62]Okay, save it.
[121:53.14]This is inventory gameplay.
[121:54.96]Yeah, that's Resident Evil, man.
[121:56.56]Alright, only one more.
[121:58.68]The one that I want to go get is out here.
[122:09.59]It's this door right there.
[122:15.19]It's like a toy store.
[122:16.03]You guys don't want me to go to the toy store?
[122:18.02]Of course you do.
[122:30.96]Okay.
[122:32.58]Whoa.
[122:35.06]Fancy box.
[122:36.62]That's the third gem.
[122:38.22]I knew I was supposed to.
[122:38.98]I knew I should have came back here.
[122:40.16]Let's go put the gem in.
[122:47.54]Box art Mega Man.
[122:49.04]Yeah.
[122:50.00]That actually is box art Mega Man, isn't it?
[122:56.69]It might have done something.
[122:57.63]Okay.
[123:01.60]bobbing head dolls your Charlotte is going to explain you shoot them you get stuff okay this too alright now we get a fun question of where was that device
[123:29.38]Right there.
[123:30.02]Okay, we gotta go back to the subway station.
[123:31.72]We're almost there.
[123:32.63]Alright.
[123:36.23]Put this green gem in.
[123:41.01]Do the donut shop.
[123:49.01]Oh, that's right.
[123:49.45]The donut shop has a locked door.
[123:51.32]Right.
[123:53.58]I know.
[123:53.96]Yeah, he's padding his short game.
[123:55.18]No, I'm just experiencing the short game.
[124:12.52]out of here.
[124:15.74]Okay, donut shop.
[124:17.16]Here it is.
[124:18.56]Open it.
[124:18.84]Another hand grenade.
[124:28.35]I don't want a grenade.
[124:34.77]Well, if I store enough grenades, maybe I'll be able to use them eventually.
[124:39.08]I have like five already.
[124:40.08]Okay, what's coming out
[124:44.47]Nothing.
[124:44.79]Keep it all in.
[124:45.89]Store it all.
[124:47.95]Take this green gem.
[124:50.15]Back up to where I needed to go.
[124:54.35]Store the shotgun?
[124:58.09]One of my tiny toons in waiting room.
[124:59.68]That's tomorrow.
[125:03.84]Alright, now we just have to get back to the station.
[125:05.24]Put this green gem in and then I can call it a chapter one complete.
[125:10.02]Let's go faster this way.
[125:17.19]He's got 13 saves in the first area.
[125:19.61]Yeah, because I'm like, I'm a save spammer.
[125:22.33]Sometimes I save three or four times in the same room before I leave.
[125:29.61]But I will go back to the machine three times before... Okay, I'm done.
[125:33.51]I'm ready to go.
[125:34.07]So I probably only really saved really... Like five times.
[125:41.26]What's with this fucking shadow?! !
[125:48.44]Wait, is the sun coming down?
[125:50.02]What the fuck?
[126:04.68]It was just so much... Turn the shadows off.
[126:06.52]This is why Counter-Strike pros don't even use them.
[126:10.86]I'm gonna heal with one of those sprays.
[126:20.61]Alright, I'm good.
[126:23.95]I didn't even need to do that, but I just did anyway.
[126:27.83]Okay.
[126:29.01]Put the green one in.
[126:37.58]Wow.
[126:40.18]Turns out that was a huge deal.
[126:45.68]Nice.
[126:52.17]Okay.
[126:53.85]I've made it to... Wait.
[126:58.31]Oh, hell yeah.
[127:02.18]Get it open.
[127:08.46]I'll take the shells.
[127:10.12]Anything else?
[127:11.70]I can go down here.
[127:12.46]Okay.
[127:21.33]Let me... Hold on.
[127:23.76]Save it.
[127:24.46]Hold on.
[127:29.02]How many shotgun shells do I have?
[127:30.18]13?
[127:30.20]Okay.
[127:34.42]Take out a first- I have the room for it, so take out a first aid spray.
[127:37.08]This is two full heals.
[127:40.99]Make another full heal.
[127:42.07]I'll store- I only need two full heals.
[127:50.61]Just get scared.
[127:51.41]Holy shit, this is boring.
[127:57.10]Ah!
[127:58.30]Oh no!
[128:05.42]There's nothing scary yet.
[128:07.26]Why would I get scared to something that's not scary?
[128:14.90]Nothing scary happened.
[128:22.08]Alright.
[128:22.64]This ain't Five Nights at Freddy's, guys.
[128:24.30]This is like Resident Evil 3 Remake.
[128:27.84]What were you expecting?
[128:29.66]Actually, Resident Evil 2 was actually really scary.
[128:32.24]Is that a complaint with this game?
[128:33.52]It might be.
[128:33.88]Okay, I was down here, and now... What's that?
[128:48.97]It's a locked door.
[128:53.59]Can I open it?
[129:00.81]With a lockpick, potentially?
[129:05.29]Is there anything down here that I can backtrack and look at?
[129:19.70]There's a door up here.
[129:23.48]I wonder if there's a lock on it.
[129:24.08]Maybe there's something in here.
[129:29.80]Uhhhhh. Aw. It's the beginning of the game.
[129:39.80]Nice gameplay.
[129:43.80]This is why I was afraid of streaming this game.
[129:47.80]Cause I told you: for every 1 person that said this game's kinda cool, like 2000 were like "this game sucks".
[129:58.94]But I'm gonna make my own goddamn case.
[130:08.70]I haven't made that case yet.
[130:13.98]I'm not ready to say that yet.
[130:15.30]Apparently a lot of you are.
[130:22.03]Seems kinda cool.
[130:29.61]Alright, let's go.
[130:30.07]Back to where I was.
[130:31.81]I did it.
[130:32.89]I got the extra bonus shit.
[130:35.42]Go back to where I was.
[130:38.54]We're cranky.
[130:40.28]Eat a fucking Snickers.
[130:43.60]Go eat something like rice or something.
[130:45.30]Go fill up on fucking macaroni.
[130:50.11]Okay.
[130:51.70]That's an ad?
[130:52.20]Sure it is.
[130:54.94]Alright, where the fuck was I going before I turned?
[130:57.64]I turned like around and was like, no, let me go all the way back.
[131:01.27]Where was I going?
[131:03.09]The garage.
[131:03.67]Okay, it was up here.
[131:04.25]Yeah, I went all the way back.
[131:25.15]It was worth it, though.
[131:25.73]I got the extra two slots.
[131:26.66]Into the garage.
[131:40.45]Walk, pick, screamer.
[131:41.35]I want to get more items.
[131:47.97]And now I'm going to save it here.
[131:49.35]17 saves in the first area.
[131:51.49]Yeah, I know.
[131:52.23]Go ahead.
[131:52.69]Laugh it up already.
[132:05.29]Okay, here we are.
[132:12.24]Turn the subway station back on.
[132:14.00]Watch out for the electric little Sparks.
[132:25.68]No dogs.
[132:26.20]I got rid of the dogs.
[132:26.94]That's good.
[132:28.44]Time for game progress.
[132:34.05]They say.
[132:48.99]Save it here.
[132:50.23]18 saves.
[132:50.93]See, these are unnecessary saves, but I need to do them.
[132:53.15]Otherwise, I don't want to go run through that.
[132:55.70]What if I get killed?
[132:57.38]Alright, it stinks down here.
[133:04.82]Yes, it does.
[133:06.39]Okay.
[133:07.79]Got the items.
[133:08.45]I'm ready.
[133:10.27]Here's the lockpick.
[133:11.13]Open it.
[133:14.57]It's probably going to be a boss.
[133:23.52]locks locks locks and subway rub a green herb said eat a green herb right get it out
[133:50.45]Oh, I made him into... I'll be alright.
[133:54.27]I'll be alright.
[133:54.77]You want me to do it?
[133:59.05]I need a green herb.
[134:02.62]I'll be okay.
[134:10.12]What the fuck is that?
[134:12.00]Parasite, parasite, parasite.
[134:13.44]But I'm fine!
[134:14.44]Use red and green.
[134:17.58]No, but that's... I don't want to use both.
[134:24.15]Alright, I'm going to go back and I'm going to take a... Alright, I'm going to go back and I'm going to take one of the green herbs out.
[134:29.43]I'm going to take both green herbs out.
[134:36.88]I want to be efficient.
[134:41.70]Just walk it off.
[134:43.24]Is this a safe scum?
[134:44.36]Yeah, whatever.
[134:45.00]I want to do it efficiently.
[134:46.94]Why am I alive?
[134:47.72]What is he doing?
[135:02.72]Holy shit.
[135:05.04]That was insane.

[135:37.05]Okay.
[135:41.43]Alright, we're good.
[135:50.14]See, I didn't have to use a full heal on that.
[135:56.47]Alright.
[135:56.87]We're good.
[135:59.65]I'll save it right here.
[136:13.79]Let's go.
[136:22.06]I think this is a shotgun time.
[136:31.65]No, it's not.
[136:32.09]It's an electricity time.
[136:56.15]Alright, I'm fine.
[137:00.13]Alright, I gotta turn the power back on.
[137:03.78]That was a real Stackem's idea?
[137:26.23]Wait!
[137:32.51]How long does it last for?
[137:35.19]Oh, just take it.
[137:35.83]Whatever.
[137:40.66]We know you want to save scum.
[137:47.84]It's a shotgun level here.
[137:49.10]I'm using the shotgun.
[137:50.39]It's a shotgun level.
[137:52.85]I'm going to use it.
[137:53.85]I'm going to make sure I use it well.
[137:57.13]I'm not fucking around right now.

[139:03.82]They take... Where'd he go?
[139:21.89]Because it's a shotgun level.
[139:26.15]Fuck.

[139:54.67]Two out of four.
[139:55.19]Let's go.
[140:05.09]Where'd he go?
[140:05.61]They're gonna come this way.
[140:09.67]They're gonna be right here.
[140:10.45]Stop making thing noises.
[140:29.36]Aim better!

[141:37.58]Don't even think about it.
[141:45.58]Don't even think about it.
[141:46.18]Don't even... Don't move.
[141:55.33]Okay.
[141:55.43]I gotta be careful.
[141:55.99]I gotta conserve ammo.
[141:59.07]Wait.
[142:00.25]Electricity explosive here.
[142:07.52]I'm willing to shock myself.
[142:21.70]Wait.
[142:22.07]How do I get this last one?
[142:23.25]I'm going to go over here.
[142:39.51]Alright, this is... Here comes... Something behind me.
[142:47.09]Something behind me.
[142:50.52]Something behind me.
[142:51.06]Something behind me.
[142:51.54]Turn it on.
[142:52.34]Uh, turn it on.
[142:54.08]Is it a full moon tomorrow?
[142:55.26]It might be.
[142:55.68]It was a full moon today.
[142:57.14]Alright, get the hell out of here.
[142:59.91]Leave.
[143:09.43]It's a shotgun level, I think.
[143:18.53]You little shit.
[143:28.16]How many more are there?
[143:29.02]Leave me the fuck alone.
[143:37.68]Mind caution?
[143:38.42]I am.
[143:40.52]I don't want to use a healing herb, though.
[143:42.82]Because... Oh, fuck.
[143:43.86]Alright, this is... Let's get out.
[143:46.24]Goodbye, ammo.
[143:49.07]Oh, yeah.

[144:14.69]Where is it?
[144:15.55]Where is it?
[144:18.21]Where am I going?
[144:19.23]To the exit?

[146:00.77]Okay, let's keep the gunpowder in there.
[146:07.11]Now this is fine.
[146:07.89]I'm in caution, but you know, whatever.
[146:09.17]He's not ready.
[146:14.13]I mean, I'm definitely ready.
[146:19.09]That's critical information.
[146:26.44]Bring the trains online in the office.
[146:29.02]Yeah, I know where that is.
[146:30.28]I know where that is.
[146:33.21]It's all the way back here.
[146:58.31]Burn.
[146:59.55]Apologize.
[147:02.37]What?
[147:15.57]By the way, that's the third time that I've looked over a chat and a scary thing happened.
[147:27.10]Can he get in?
[147:28.85]Wait, he can cut- he can come in the doors just walking in normally?
[147:32.51]Alright, here we go.
[147:33.97]This is where it's-
[148:01.45]Oh, he... No, he's... He's coming back.
[148:26.33]Wait till we don't hear footsteps.
[148:29.86]What is in here?
[148:30.96]This is the part where I turn around and there's like a fucking dragon's mouth behind me.
[148:35.49]Just like ready to just close and kill me.
[149:01.72]No, no, no.
[149:01.98]Don't need that.
[149:17.03]Over the door!
[149:24.44]Where do I gotta go?
[149:25.42]Through the garage down to the subway station.
[149:38.09]Call the police.
[149:38.81]The police can't help me.
[149:50.68]Carlos!
[149:51.52]That thing is still alive!
[149:53.14]It's after me!
[149:54.44]What?
[149:55.49]Run!
[149:56.21]Come back to the station!
[149:58.53]Not until I get traffic control online.
[150:09.36]Okay.
[150:11.50]She did call the police.
[150:15.74]That's true.
[150:16.38]Okay.

[150:18.52]I might need some more gunpowder here.
[150:23.40]Or I can make these into... No, I need them.
[150:26.34]I mean, you gotta do what you have to do.
[150:28.10]Take out a grenade.
[150:36.95]Oh yeah, I can throw it at Nemesis.
[150:40.05]How many grenades can I have in one stack?
[150:42.17]Alright, I'll take out all three grenades.
[150:44.83]How do you use a grenade?
[150:46.67]I know that's a really dumb question.
[150:48.75]I'm talking about in this game.
[150:49.87]What's the protocol to throw the grenade?
[150:51.94]Is it cook, tilt, throw?
[150:54.04]How does it work?
[150:58.22]Am I going to get a golf game thing that shows how far it's going?
[151:01.38]How does it work?
[151:05.04]I need to remember where I've got to go.
[151:06.28]This way.
[151:07.72]Oh, fuck.

[152:08.70]Alright, run.
[152:09.58]He's gonna get back up.
[152:13.44]Where do I need to go?

[165:55.33]In addition to dampening sound, it also tightens the firing pattern for greater chance of crits.
[166:00.73]Imagine if I didn't pick that up.
[166:07.41]Alright, I got it.
[166:08.27]Alright, we're good.
[166:26.87]Save it here?
[166:30.01]Take knife, take knife.
[166:33.49]Take the knife, take the knife, take the knife.
[166:36.22]Take the knife, take the knife, take the knife.
[166:37.78]You guys are going to get me killed.
[166:41.68]You're going to get me killed?
[166:43.88]Why is this shotgun smaller than the handgun?
[166:48.44]Weird.
[166:56.04]Okay, I'm ready.
[166:59.24]I don't listen to chat.
[167:00.36]What am I listening to?
[167:01.34]I'm not listening to chat.
[167:07.74]It's a foldable shotgun.
[167:13.91]Status report.
[167:28.89]No chance of fighting our way out of this city.
[167:32.99]Why is she here?
[167:34.61]She's helping get the trains running again.
[167:37.31]What's going on with the hair?
[167:38.73]I keep thinking you're talking about me.
[167:42.16]Hey, take it easy.
[167:46.90]She'll get you killed.
[167:52.24]Sorry about that.
[167:54.04]Everyone's a little worked up.
[167:55.44]Okay.
[167:58.98]He's back.
[167:59.38]Lower the creature.
[168:00.66]Is that car?
[168:04.58]Wait.
[168:05.76]Where the fuck did he come from?
[168:08.69]I thought I...
[168:25.13]I thought that was... I thought he was punching me in the back.
[168:27.25]Like, hurry the fuck up and get in there and run!
[168:29.19]Just don't taunt him!
[168:34.22]Just run away!
[168:51.73]Does he drop a box?
[168:52.97]Give me a box!
[168:54.03]I want loot!
[168:54.41]That's what you do, right?
[169:25.06]Leave me alone.
[169:25.56]Come on, you creepy-ass stalker!
[169:30.02]You want stars?
[169:31.46]I'll give you stars!
[169:33.30]It's like, I don't even know what the fuck it is, man!
[169:35.16]Come on, you creepy-ass stalker!
[169:48.33]You want stars?
[169:49.79]I'll give you stars!
[170:02.01]Does he drop something or not?
[170:05.75]Where the fuck am I?
[170:06.41]Okay.
[170:17.10]This might work.
[170:35.43]Give me that crate!
[170:36.45]Give me that crate!
[170:37.77]Give me that crate!
[170:53.41]Open the fucking door!
[171:08.87]Why are you taking it with you?
[171:10.23]Oh, no, that's not fair.
[171:15.05]Turn the gas on, whatever this is.
[171:21.46]Oh, it's a big door.
[171:22.44]Okay.
[171:25.92]Am I safe?
[171:32.48]Carlos, do you copy?
[171:34.87]Carlos?
[171:36.61]Oh, shit.
[171:42.66]Find a way above ground.
[171:45.21]I can try.
[171:45.75]Heal yourself.
[171:52.05]Fucking heal.
[171:52.69]I don't need it right now.
[171:58.29]Come on, caution.
[171:59.09]Caution doesn't mean heal.
[172:02.11]Caution means you're fucked if you don't heal soon.
[172:04.83]Not right now, but soon.
[172:06.29]That's what caution is.
[172:13.86]Oh, the case.
[172:14.38]How many?
[172:21.50]Twelve?
[172:25.83]Six.
[172:26.09]I need more handgun ammo.
[172:37.33]Alright.
[172:41.97]I want to get rid of the fucking knife so bad.
[172:43.79]I know it's probably... I should get rid of the dumb knife.
[172:53.36]For this.
[172:53.74]Until I find a green herb.
[172:55.50]That's going to come back to haunt me, I know.
[173:09.81]Throwing that away.
[173:39.14]Okay, uh, we're gonna play.
[173:41.34]You respond to it.
[173:43.10]Recoil.
[173:43.72]We got the sewers map.
[173:48.42]Let's find a way.
[173:49.06]Okay, let's go.
[173:56.38]Alright, gotta go.
[174:00.44]Have fun.
[174:01.62]Thanks for sticking around.
[174:06.74]Why does there always have to be a sewer?
[174:10.10]I hate sewer levels.
[174:11.08]They really are the worst.
[174:17.85]Nobody ever says, oh boy, a sewer level.
[174:30.01]Shit.
[174:38.71]That's a little shortcut eventually.
[174:40.15]A big slot for something?
[174:48.69]Big power battery.
[174:52.65]Increased sewer security.
[174:55.25]We've been receiving reports of unauthorized personnel in the control areas of the facility.
[174:58.55]In response, we're replacing the aging mechanical locks with new protocols.
[175:03.64]Need a battery pack.
[175:07.18]Okay, we need battery packs to open these doors.
[175:09.84]Where does that leave us?
[175:10.62]That leaves us with going just down here.
[175:14.36]Now I gotta turn the light on in my room, not off.
[175:27.62]Oh, God.
[175:29.20]I'm definitely burning these clothes.
[175:36.51]Could be bugs down here.
[175:37.63]Probably, right?
[175:44.78]Let's figure something out.
[175:45.94]Animal.
[175:47.50]Animal bug hybrid.
[175:50.29]Shotgun level.
[176:09.46]Okay, so it's a shotgun level.
[176:18.86]It's just a sewer alligator.
[176:24.71]Yes, it is.
[176:33.32]Still have the items?
[176:37.04]Oh, no.
[176:37.18]I'm good.
[176:39.91]Alright, I gotta get the battery pack.
[176:44.42]Before I fall down this.
[176:45.94]Nothing over here I can't grab anything?
[176:47.18]No.
[176:49.28]It's just a goldfish.
[176:50.22]That's just how big they get.
[176:54.28]Okay, let's try this again this time shotgun in the face.
[176:57.08]Why is there a gun symbol on the ground over here?
[177:07.61]Oh, hand grenade!
[177:10.04]Oh, let's go!
[177:10.59]Equip it!
[177:14.15]Alright, yeah, let's try it.
[177:14.89]Here we go.
[177:30.66]Too early!
[177:36.94]How do you throw a grenade too early?
[177:38.50]What do you mean?
[177:39.30]It blew up the whole hallway.
[177:40.54]Alright, there's two ways to go here.
[177:47.22]You're supposed to get the grenade in the mouth.
[177:53.14]Really?
[177:54.82]Oh, whatever.
[177:55.27]I'll remember that for next time.
[177:59.87]Explosive B. Combine with explosive... Thanks for the fucking tip.
[178:04.61]Combine with explosive A to create flame rounds or combine with another B to make acid rounds.
[178:11.12]Right.
[178:12.58]They come in handy, especially when I hoard them all to the very last moment in the game and use every single round of acid spray on the last boss.
[178:23.56]Oh, just kidding.
[178:24.48]I left it in the storage box.
[178:26.16]I'm using the default handgun to end the game.
[178:37.01]Ooh, grenade launcher.
[178:38.49]That's pretty sick.
[178:43.08]Hold on.
[178:43.90]Invoice from the gun shop.
[178:47.24]Thank you for purchasing the XXXXXX.
[178:53.52]We're in the future.
[178:54.62]Welcome to what every graphics card is going to have to start doing.
[178:58.33]In like 200 years, when we're on like generation 80 of NVIDIA GPUs,
[179:06.29]What are they going to do?
[179:07.11]Start over at zero like a thousand times?
[179:08.73]I think they're going to drop the numbers and the names altogether.
[179:15.04]Is it going to go by year?
[179:16.18]I don't know.
[179:17.36]I'm actually confused as to why they don't do that already.
[179:20.50]Like, you know, the NVIDIA GeForce 2020.
[179:23.92]Like a car.
[179:26.28]I know what a GeForce 1995 is like.
[179:29.06]I know what a car... Like used cars.
[179:32.85]Why don't they just call them by car name?
[179:34.41]I don't understand.
[179:36.16]But I have to add, like, RTX 2180.
[179:37.82]No, no, no.
[179:39.46]It's 2020.
[179:40.26]It's a fucking 2000... It's a bit... Things are not in great shape, but it's alright.
[179:43.96]It's got a few miles on it.
[179:45.66]It's a fucking, like, 2013.
[179:47.58]NVIDIA GeForce.
[179:50.00]Gotta get the Kelly Blue Book value.
[179:54.16]God.
[179:54.92]Okay.
[179:55.18]Explosive resist.
[179:55.92]Yeah, I know how to do this.
[180:01.92]Only one graphics card per year?
[180:04.64]Well, no.
[180:05.38]Even if they didn't have one come out for like a couple years, it would still just be like the 2022.
[180:08.12]The NVIDIA GeForce 2022.
[180:10.58]They're going to do that eventually.
[180:14.06]They're going to get so sick of fucking naming shit.
[180:17.48]Do I bring this?
[180:22.10]This is too big.
[180:22.84]This is huge.
[180:25.08]I feel like I might need it, though.
[180:26.10]I'm going to bring it.
[180:37.28]Yeah, I'll bring it.
[180:37.68]I've got two heals, ammo, ammo, lockpick, and then the super grenade launcher.
[180:44.37]I have two rounds in it.
[180:45.13]Two flame rounds.
[180:46.87]Okay, good to know.
[180:47.67]Hopefully I don't accidentally use that.
[180:50.44]Research log.
[180:52.50]Temperature of the water and pH level is not that great.
[180:56.46]There might be something... There's something in the water.
[180:58.20]Apparently.
[181:00.85]Alright, let's go.
[181:10.04]Let's find a way back out.
[181:15.17]So.
[181:17.99]What does this do for me?
[181:19.53]I gotta go back to the split.
[181:23.55]Keep the shotgun out.
[181:24.40]I don't want to get insta-killed.
[181:25.66]It's gonna pop out, one of these.
[181:43.10]Which hole is he gonna come out of?
[181:44.26]That's the guess.
[181:48.03]Done.
[181:48.49]He's just gonna be down the hallway.
[181:55.75]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[182:05.81]Holy shit, these guys suck.
[182:12.95]Real wink.
[182:17.43]Shot it with his mouth closed.
[182:18.23]I shot it one time with his mouth closed.
[182:19.81]I didn't know it had to be open.
[182:21.19]Fuck.
[182:23.91]I don't like this.
[182:24.94]What was that?
[182:38.56]Hmm.
[182:39.63]Through the goo.
[182:41.87]Splits again.
[182:42.55]Okay.
[182:57.87]Oh!
[183:07.46]Ah!
[183:14.32]Oh, I thought I was done right there.
[183:15.86]That was horrible.
[183:16.95]I'm still at caution.
[183:22.33]Okay, I just gotta make it to a... What's this?
[183:26.27]Coffee cups?
[183:27.25]Flame rounds.
[183:28.91]Hot coffee.
[183:29.41]Alright.
[183:41.39]There's another... This splits, so I gotta remember that.
[183:46.54]Any of the bullshit over here?
[183:50.07]I would love a save point.
[183:53.15]Fantastic.
[183:53.85]Give me a save point in here.
[183:57.21]You and I will be so happy.
[183:58.47]Battery pack.
[183:59.23]I don't want to touch that yet because it's going to summon you-know-who.
[184:02.94]A love letter.
[184:20.39]My beloved Hunter Gammas.
[184:22.61]Really superior.
[184:23.35]I think that's the thing that we're fighting right now.
[184:28.27]I'm gonna make shotgun shells, I think.
[184:31.59]I think I brought this.
[184:39.61]Ooh, Explosive A. Hold on a sec.
[184:45.58]Explosive A. I'm making shotgun shells.
[184:50.00]I want them.
[184:53.68]I'm a shotgun user.
[184:54.48]Okay.
[185:02.25]Make acid rounds.
[185:03.25]People happy.
[185:06.75]Um... We'll see.
[185:10.55]I have to be very careful here.
[185:13.60]Because I'm gonna touch this and then something's gonna break the door down and I have one save point.
[185:19.44]Go.
[185:21.10]This thing is huge.
[185:24.53]Why is it that big?
[185:25.18]I'm going to have to take one of the heals.
[185:33.74]I'm just going to go to full health.
[185:35.89]That's the worst that happens.
[185:52.46]Oh, you have a rare Lucario.
[185:54.26]Oh, wait.
[185:54.86]That's a reference to the second video game from last year or two years ago.
[186:00.15]I get that reference.
[186:02.39]Actually, yeah.
[186:03.15]Hold on a minute.
[186:03.63]My facecam's got to get a little brighter.
[186:07.35]I'm kind of just... I'm just silhouetted out here.
[186:10.27]Let me help you out here.
[186:24.60]Better?
[186:32.29]Better, right?
[186:32.75]You can see me?
[186:39.61]Good.
[186:44.44]I'm ready to go.
[186:57.01]You can see me, right?
[187:01.46]What the fuck happened to the guy in the corner?
[187:07.68]Wait, what is this?
[187:10.50]Wait, what is that?
[187:15.48]Why is it listed as something I didn't touch?
[187:25.39]Ah!
[187:25.51]That's why.
[187:30.43]I used the full heal and this is just sitting here.
[188:00.87]Alright, I won't I won't I won't I won't fine.
[188:03.17]I'm just gonna block I was gonna just get rid of nine rounds Okay, I gotta be very careful I
[188:32.71]What?
[188:34.59]I shot her right in the fucking mouth.
[188:43.88]Why?
[188:44.54]What?
[188:52.59]Oh, thank god.
[188:53.17]It's an autosave.
[189:01.03]Nice tuber thumbnail.
[189:10.71]Yeah, I just like pulled a quarter from behind your ear.
[189:13.22]And I was like, look at that!
[189:14.24]Wow, sonny!
[189:15.02]It's gonna happen again.
[189:16.32]I gotta fucking just stop talking.
[189:19.92]How do I skip this?
[189:20.82]Skip, skip, skip, skip.
[189:26.62]Use the grenade?
[189:27.26]No, I want to keep those rounds.
[189:28.88]They're fucking very valuable.
[189:33.52]I have to do good shotgun shots.
[189:41.28]I only have four.
[189:42.24]What if Nemesis shows up?
[189:43.52]I gotta kill Nemesis with this thing.
[189:44.76]Open your mouth.
[190:04.59]Oh, he's dead.
[190:10.95]For a second, I thought he wasn't.
[190:16.03]Save it for the final boss.
[190:17.17]That's what I'm saying.
[190:17.69]I'm going to be able to shoot the final boss like 15 times with a grenade.
[190:21.64]They're not even at the final boss.
[190:35.73]Okay, Explosive A and Explosive B.
[190:42.88]I can make, um, flame rounds.
[190:47.84]Should I use flame rounds or should I get the other ones?
[190:53.71]Should I get acid?
[190:55.53]Wait for explosive C and get acid?
[190:57.99]Sounds fun.
[191:00.57]Our battery's about to be gone.
[191:01.59]I have all this bullshit in here.
[191:12.01]I don't have any more... I gotta get that herb.
[191:16.99]And make a big herb.
[191:18.63]And dump this battery pack.
[191:21.13]Stake him his hair.
[191:21.79]Now just start banning people.
[191:24.59]Start banning them.
[191:25.33]And make sure in your ban message you say... And don't ever come back.
[191:30.28]In all capitals.
[191:40.12]Okay.
[191:41.24]Go get the herb.
[191:42.04]Combine it.
[191:42.54]It's going to run back and forth in circles and shit.
[191:46.74]Hopefully... I don't think anything else is going to spawn.
[191:49.08]Why would it?
[191:49.72]It would be really, really sad if it did.
[191:51.20]Then I have to use another one of these.
[191:55.52]That would be very sad.
[192:05.57]Sponsored by Steakums.
[192:07.09]No, it's not.
[192:07.45]It's not.
[192:35.15]You just took a freeze frame from every commercial from somewhere in the mid-90s when the product was very, very, very sour.
[192:45.26]I was in the middle of just changing into a fruit-based person.
[192:51.80]My head was about to turn into a weird strawberry or something.
[193:01.22]That's a pretty good freeze frame.
[193:04.75]Okay.
[193:06.77]Pick this up, bring it back to the box.
[193:10.11]Backtracking.
[193:11.73]Just never-ending backtracking the game.
[193:13.93]I know, that's what we're playing.
[193:16.70]I knew what you were getting into when you signed up for my weekly newsletter.
[193:21.26]Padding, padding, padding.
[193:28.12]Padding, padding, padding.
[193:29.54]It's not padding.
[193:40.43]It's just the game.
[193:43.89]Adding Perry?
[193:44.73]Is that a name?
[193:49.50]Perry's not a name.
[193:55.70]Perry?
[193:56.12]Matthew Perry.
[194:02.39]No.
[194:03.55]A last name, but is there a first name that's Perry?
[194:06.71]Perry?
[194:08.04]Not like Barry.
[194:09.46]Parry.
[194:10.76]P-A-R-R-Y.
[194:12.78]Percy?
[194:13.26]No, that's not what we said.
[194:14.56]We said Parry.
[194:17.50]Harry Potter.
[194:19.54]You motherfucker.
[194:24.72]Okay, let's get this shit out of here.
[194:26.44]Combine with... Open the fucking door.
[194:33.34]Store this temporarily.
[194:34.52]Take this out.
[194:35.18]Combine you and you.
[194:37.26]I'm going to keep this.
[194:37.90]Because I'm about to get two slots now.
[194:43.88]Two full heals.
[194:44.70]A little bit of ammo.
[194:47.00]Lockpick and I need it.
[194:47.81]Okay, battery goes in.
[194:49.19]Let's go.
[194:50.35]Save it.
[194:54.55]Blueberry Perry.

[201:18.19]Sorry.
[201:19.77]Not showing the shelf.

[202:59.53]I want to get it.
[203:01.29]Although, guys, I'm going to be so absolutely useless if I don't get items in rooms.
[203:06.26]What do you want?
[203:08.40]Do you want to lose?
[203:13.59]Imagine if I didn't pick this up.
[203:16.71]Oh.

[204:30.54]That thing was so... I used to want one of those things so bad.
[204:33.50]The little thing where they slide it in and the ghost gets stored.
[204:37.13]Why haven't they made a... They did make a decent Ghostbusters game.
[204:39.99]Never mind.
[204:40.71]That's still a long time ago, though.
[204:48.22]Was it like 2007?
[204:48.54]Long time ago.
[204:56.50]Alright.
[205:00.12]Epic Games Store exclusive.
[205:01.10]They remastered it.
[205:01.70]I'd love a new Ghostbusters game that just had nothing to do with the movies.
[205:19.84]All the Ghostbusters games, they just want to tie it back to the movies.
[205:23.50]It's got to be part of the movie frame.
[205:24.90]No, just have a Ghostbusters game and have it be... Fucking was talking.
[205:31.61]Interruption.

[218:57.02]What am I gonna miss?
[218:59.10]How do I know things that I'm gonna miss if I don't know they exist in the first place?
[219:02.52]I'm gonna miss

[219:32.67]And I just thought it was just the NPC random AI dialog behind the... I thought that was just like a, alright, let's hunker down here, sweetheart.
[219:43.03]End conversation.
[219:44.07]NPC says three words.
[219:47.21]Whatever.
[219:47.49]I ain't going back.
[219:54.55]Well, I mean, I am going back for this.
[219:57.13]Wait.
[219:59.59]It's fine.
[220:11.80]Open.
[220:15.08]I have no heart.
[220:15.98]I got stuff.
[220:19.81]I got shit.
[220:21.85]Is that one-time use?
[220:36.49]How did you let that happen?
[220:38.01]I shot him like one, two, three.
[221:08.65]No.
[221:10.03]I ain't gonna let that happen.
[221:20.96]The herb.
[221:21.16]Is that fucking herb?
[221:25.60]Where's the herb?
[221:27.52]Where's the herb?
[221:30.82]What's it doing in this box?
[221:32.44]Take it out!
[221:33.52]Save it here, just in case I need to do that again.
[221:37.49]Wait, the door!
[221:58.98]Alright, take two.
[222:05.82]Open.
[222:07.04]Drop it.
[222:09.08]Kill this guy.
[222:10.41]No, don't even just run by him.
[222:11.83]Pick up the herb and get the fuck out of here.
[222:13.67]Oh, get the fuck out.
[222:18.65]You're gonna have to shotgun this guy.
[222:20.45]No, you're not.
[222:50.53]Don't accidentally shoot a fucking grenade in here.
[222:54.81]We're upset because Jerma missed the chance to save them.
[223:02.75]Now you're going to spoil Resident Evil 3 Remake?
[223:14.66]Excuse me.
[223:21.15]I'll go upstairs.
[223:30.86]Onto the bed?
[223:32.83]Raccoon Times.
[223:35.01]I'm writing to you because I'm troubled, deeply troubled.
[223:37.65]Anyone who's been a parent knows that the Crystal Promenade is the place to take your kids for a trip downtown on Saturdays.
[223:43.42]There's no more, and there's no store more popular or harder on a parent's wallet than Toy Uncle.
[223:51.28]However, I've noticed that on windy days, the big statue above the entrance wobbles.
[223:56.08]Like the only thing holding it up is a couple of screws.
[223:59.27]When that statue's head tumbles loose one day, children will be hurt.
[224:02.43]I've complained about this many times.
[224:05.29]Glad I took the time to read this one.
[224:07.01]I'll take it.
[224:19.82]I got tons of rounds in this now.
[224:22.77]I thought that was a fucking tongue coming down to, like, grab me by the shoulder.
[224:27.24]Nope, it's just a ceiling fan.
[224:28.50]We're good.
[224:33.98]That is going into timeout mode.
[224:35.14]Uh-oh.
[224:46.63]Just shut him up.
[224:48.42]Just shut him up.
[224:50.92]It's like a deal with you.
[224:56.77]Where we at?
[224:59.45]Herbs.
[225:00.19]Yes.
[225:00.81]Herbs.
[225:01.29]That's right.
[225:05.55]Crash?
[225:06.65]Nothing.
[225:08.81]Back to the fire truck.
[225:10.01]Now.
[225:10.27]Look at this funny link I made.
[225:16.27]He's back.
[225:16.89]Now he has a different weapon.
[225:20.36]What is this?
[225:21.50]Why does he have all these cool things?
[225:25.44]He missed!
[225:29.68]Holy shit, your aim is bad.
[225:33.69]I thought this guy was supposed to be like a super mutant.
[225:41.03]Did I just dodge it?
[225:47.78]Oh man, you guys think my aim is bad.
[225:58.94]Are they calling me?
[226:07.68]They might be more than one, Carlos.
[226:09.58]Wow!
[226:09.76]Nemesis!
[226:10.14]Holy shit, man!
[226:27.88]Like, a three-year-old can hit somebody this close.
[226:34.24]Give your brother the controller.
[226:36.00]Trust me.
[226:36.62]It's a bad look.
[226:37.41]Stay.
[226:40.23]Alright.
[226:50.89]Wait, am I dead?
[226:51.83]Or was that supposed to happen?
[226:59.14]Nemesis, give Mr. X the controller.
[227:02.78]That's good.
[227:16.46]What am I doing?
[227:16.88]In danger?
[227:17.34]Not anymore.
[227:18.72]Is it still chasing me?
[227:26.61]Wait.
[227:29.02]Is he going up here again?
[227:29.86]He ignored the spray?
[227:38.47]You snorted some herbs and now you're good as new.
[227:47.33]That's kind of what happened.
[227:51.46]Okay.
[227:51.60]Back to the station.
[227:52.20]So we gotta go down here, as we gotta go left.
[227:54.58]Left.
[227:55.31]Right.
[227:55.47]Left.
[227:55.65]Left.
[227:55.79]Right.
[228:25.25]He is really bad.
[228:26.57]I thought I could... It was really bad.
[228:49.89]He didn't even mean to do that.
[228:51.19]He doesn't even see his name on the kill feed.
[228:52.77]He wasn't even looking.
[228:55.76]He holds down tab in like fucking 20 minutes and goes, how did I get like 30 points?
[228:59.52]What the fuck did I even do?
[229:00.72]I was just spamming down the same hallway.
[229:03.92]I guess I heard hit markers at random times, but I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[229:11.79]Go!
[229:12.09]Am I safe?
[229:26.87]Okay, it doesn't roll back, right?
[229:30.99]No.
[229:32.27]Hello?
[229:42.90]It's okay, he's fucking terrible.
[229:47.48]But I'm not.
[230:00.25]Is he good?
[230:01.17]Is he dead?
[230:05.42]Give me my box!
[230:12.82]I can't believe he hit me!
[230:19.98]Why?!
[230:20.46]I ju- I want the box!
[230:38.63]I'm loot hungry.
[230:41.37]God damn it.
[230:49.53]I know how this works.
[230:50.85]Skip this.
[230:53.01]Oh, fuck!
[230:59.07]Okay, this electrical box right here.
[231:01.36]It's gonna drop down, I'm gonna shoot the electricity box and I'm gonna run.
[231:08.71]If they drop down, I'm gonna get them.
[231:14.44]How can I hear those?
[231:15.00]Shoot.
[231:25.11]Where is he?
[231:31.27]Didn't work.
[231:41.00]Excuse me, sir, can you... He's behind me!
[232:08.70]Shoot him.
[232:09.16]Why would I shoot the guy in front of me?
[232:13.54]Get in a safe place.

[233:03.64]Well, what matters is that we can get everyone out of the city now.
[233:07.48]Simp, Chad.
[233:14.34]What about you?
[233:14.80]Where are you going?
[233:16.76]I won't be catching the train.
[233:18.91]Why not?
[233:20.39]There'll be new orders.
[233:23.29]If it means I can help save the city, it's fine by me.
[233:37.53]I was really hoping for a... Carlos!
[233:44.47]Carlos just died and then get a start from that point.
[233:50.54]But, didn't happen.
[234:04.86]Good work.
[234:06.12]Your reputation is well deserved.
[234:08.88]Get inside.
[234:09.68]The subway's about to leave.
[234:11.92]Carlos, Tyrell, you have your orders.
[234:13.88]You need to go back out into the city and find Nathaniel Bart.
[234:18.79]This isn't the last ride out of town, right?
[234:21.07]Do not worry.
[234:22.35]Once the civilians are safe, the train will be back.
[234:25.69]It's alright.
[234:26.17]You go on ahead.
[234:27.71]I'm not going to die on you and leave you in a cold, cruel, Carlos-less world.
[234:32.10]Okay.
[234:33.39]So we leave.
[234:33.95]Wave goodbye to them.
[234:35.11]Say bye everybody.
[234:36.67]Bye guys.
[234:36.89]It was fun.
[235:05.17]You don't really think a pencil pusher like Bartok is still alive, do you?
[235:13.06]I haven't done good authority.
[235:15.02]Why?
[235:15.28]Are you worried about teammates?
[235:23.56]Or something else?
[235:28.85]Funny how brainless zombies can ambush a platoon like that.
[235:34.35]Funny the gate was locked.
[235:37.45]Don't you think?
[235:43.18]Why are they Russian?
[235:44.74]Well, you can very easily replace any interesting potential character with they're a Russian guy.
[235:51.26]How is this fucker not dead yet?
[235:52.84]No, they're gone.
[235:54.78]Come, this way.
[236:00.15]Nikolai, what are you doing?
[236:02.30]It's not after you.
[236:04.98]I'm Russian.
[236:06.52]We're evil in all games.
[236:08.60]How could you not have seen that?
[236:15.77]Get off my train, shit bird!

[237:05.91]No!
[237:07.95]It's not funny!
[237:08.73]It's not funny.
[237:09.41]I'm sorry.
[237:10.67]I...
[237:34.02]I was going to scream zombies and I lost five bullets.
[237:37.70]Who cares?
[237:38.06]I'm done.
[237:39.60]Let's go.
[237:48.11]Game on.
[237:48.49]Game on.
[237:48.95]Game on.
[237:49.87]What about all my items?
[237:55.21]Here he is.
[237:55.91]Sorry.
[237:56.19]Sorry.
[238:18.08]No, Brad!
[238:18.54]I got him!
[238:48.31]ID card.
[238:50.06]Wait.
[238:58.88]I'm being a real lip-biter right now.
[239:01.32]Mm-mm.
[239:01.73]Gotta stop doing that.
[239:04.11]I gotta put on my anti-lip-biting ointment.
[239:06.11]This is really what this is for.
[239:07.37]Because then if I do it, it'll be gross.
[239:14.92]And I'll go, ugh.
[239:16.26]And I won't do it.
[239:25.88]Nothing else.
[239:31.66]Nintendo Switch cartridges.
[239:33.38]Oh, this is from the second game.
[239:35.02]Remember?
[239:35.44]Drive your gun.
[239:36.06]So we're back to the police station.
[239:54.41]Assault rifle.
[239:55.07]Okay.
[239:55.61]G18 handgun.
[239:56.95]Take a look at this.
[239:58.77]I've located the Star's office.
[240:00.91]Remember, Bard had access to Umbrella's darkest secrets.
[240:04.44]Brad?
[240:04.92]Why are they saying... Why are they saying Brad like that?
[240:06.98]Bard... So this search and rescue mission is really more like find and detain.
[240:10.94]It's like malicious compliance.
[240:12.44]There was a typo.
[240:14.14]Good to know.
[240:15.58]I'll open the shutter so you can get through.
[240:18.08]You stay here and find out what's been going on here at the station.
[240:21.25]Call you if I find anything.
[240:24.18]Predator.
[240:26.12]Does that mean Mr. X shows up here?
[240:30.00]Okay, so.
[240:41.98]Here we go.
[240:42.72]Find Dr. Bard.
[240:44.42]Go to Star's office.
[240:46.62]Saved it.
[240:48.36]Take everything I need.
[240:49.04]Here we go.
[240:59.44]I don't have a key for this.
[241:01.78]Wait.
[241:05.38]Oh, they've upgraded.
[241:07.43]Why did we go from... We went from locked with a key to locked with a key card.
[241:14.35]Each member of the force has been issued an ID card.
[241:16.17]From now on, the same card will be required to access all storage boxes.
[241:19.54]Don't lend your card to anyone.
[241:22.52]So this is just the key.
[241:28.01]Alright, let's go.
[241:30.59]What's this?
[241:38.61]Uh, some kind of note.
[241:42.73]Take my upvote, LOL.
[241:44.06]I know what it is.
[241:44.50]I played the second game.
[241:55.00]Yeah, I hate these things too, though.
[242:00.58]Couldn't have been a zombie.
[242:11.52]Why open this fucking door?
[242:12.53]Oh, right.
[242:13.57]This hasn't been opened yet.
[242:15.75]In Leon's playthrough.
[242:22.45]Didn't stick around.
[242:24.03]It's gone.
[242:27.79]Here we go.
[242:31.05]Just one zombie.
[242:34.47]Don't psych yourself out, man.
[242:39.47]And that didn't kill him.
[242:42.37]Happy cake day.
[242:50.10]Here's an upvote.
[242:50.98]Stop!
[242:51.34]I didn't even like that website.
[243:08.73]Okay.
[243:15.40]This is the operations room.
[243:19.42]Something in here.
[243:22.12]It's on this table.
[243:23.52]Oh.
[243:28.68]Flash grenade.
[243:29.45]Mm-hmm.
[243:30.61]I'm going to use that on Nemesis.
[243:35.39]Anything that's in here that is, alright.
[243:40.25]I wish Carlos had his own game.
[243:41.59]It kind of is his own game, isn't it?
[243:44.58]His game.
[243:45.74]He shares it with somebody else.
[243:49.36]Wait, I'll just... Hold on.
[243:50.60]The game's over in like an hour.
[243:52.06]When you play as Carlos, isn't it like... That's like the second... Into the second half of the game, right?
[244:16.82]Or like two?
[244:18.06]Oh.
[244:19.06]Okay.
[244:23.76]Can't open this door.
[244:24.40]Unlock it.
[244:24.94]The lock is right in front of you.
[244:25.84]It's right there.
[244:26.36]Unlock it.
[244:27.37]Unlock it!
[244:40.04]Oh lord.
[244:40.56]What happened here?
[244:49.43]I don't even know where I'm supposed to go.
[244:51.97]West office.
[244:56.75]Here we are.
[245:03.79]Thought rifle scope.
[245:13.33]Now it's more accurate.
[245:15.93]I have plenty of ammo, right?
[245:20.66]punch zombies as Carlos?
[245:22.26]Ooh, that's cool.
[245:30.69]Who's doing that?
[245:33.95]Who's doing that?
[245:36.41]He's dead?
[245:38.63]You opened the fucking door?
[245:39.85]Close the door.
[245:55.74]I grabbed the There's a safe in here.
[246:02.92]I played the last game like two years ago.
[246:05.62]What was the safe password? 985
[246:24.01]It's gotta be on a note somewhere.
[246:28.29]How are you guys still getting up?
[246:33.67]Alright, I'm running.
[246:35.99]I need to go to... I'm just gonna go over here and open this door.
[246:41.45]I can't open this door.
[246:56.82]Oh.
[246:58.12]Okay.
[246:58.37]He kind of didn't.
[246:59.31]Alright, is that everything I can really do in here besides this safe... It's a safety deposit room.
[247:17.08]Dark room.
[247:18.84]Oh, it does work.
[247:31.08]Okay, so that leaves the dark room.
[247:46.70]Alright.
[247:49.54]Why is it so dark in here?
[247:51.78]I mean, don't answer that.
[247:52.60]I know it's a dark room, but like, it was very dark.
[247:56.48]Exceptionally dark.
[247:58.20]Alright.
[248:00.25]uh office supply internal relocation heat resistant three number combination safe moved from star's office to the west office left nine right fifteen left seven nine fifteen seven nine fifteen seven got it
[248:29.96]Uh, let's store these for now.
[248:32.78]While I get another herb.
[248:33.92]Turn this on.
[248:39.66]Alright.
[248:43.33]Okay.
[249:01.85]Okay, 9, no, 15.
[249:03.51]What was it, 15?
[249:13.14]Oh, that was fucking extreme reaction time.
[249:15.46]Okay.
[249:27.01]The safe is... What was it?
[249:30.09]9.
[249:31.41]Left 9.
[249:31.69]I went... Hey, just get out.
[249:35.63]9.
[249:35.67]15.
[249:35.69]7.
[249:35.73]Nice.
[249:57.63]Nice.
[249:59.13]That makes me happy.
[250:00.53]Okay.
[250:03.29]Now we need to go upstairs.
[250:04.25]Wait a minute.
[250:13.16]Press report.
[250:18.16]The explosives collected from the suspect's person and residence appear to be extremely powerful.
[250:22.95]As a safety, a battery was removed from one detonation device upon its admission into evidence.
[250:28.05]The battery was secured in a safety deposit room.
[250:39.10]That guy was really late to come in here.
[250:53.52]Get away from me.
[250:58.01]Sicko.
[251:01.31]Ooh, candy.
[251:02.63]Oh, it's coffee.
[251:03.11]Never mind.
[251:05.83]Ooh.
[251:12.62]Ah, green herb.
[251:13.80]I'll take it.
[251:18.36]Need to get... Let's go back and make a heal.
[251:20.76]Full heal.
[251:27.91]Am I going the right way?
[251:28.63]Yes.
[251:32.38]How could you not like this game?
[251:34.96]Ah, I see what you're doing there.
[251:44.75]It's good.
[251:45.11]I don't hate this game.
[251:52.39]We'll see in another couple hours.
[251:55.62]We'll see how I feel in another hour or two.
[252:00.38]Probably gonna get attacked.
[252:17.59]It is up ahead.
[252:23.15]Note to a friend.
[252:23.73]If you're reading this, I'm already dead.
[252:25.95]If you hear any noises coming from the locker, do not open it.
[252:29.95]While you're on patrol, I focused on finding a way to get to the other side.
[252:32.39]I realized that explosives might be our best bet.
[252:35.13]I rigged up a pretty good bomb, but we don't have any batteries.
[252:39.19]Sent one to the safety deposit room, right?
[252:42.03]We need that battery if we're going to knock this wall down, so I headed upstairs to find you.
[252:45.67]I know you have the safety deposit room.
[252:51.18]We had five.
[252:51.76]Did five subs just come in?
[252:54.16]Yes, they did.
[252:54.68]From Curlyboy.
[252:55.48]Thanks, Curlyboy.
[252:57.33]Appreciate the five subs.
[252:59.59]Uh, this is... I wouldn't have this info.
[253:12.72]Nobody in the shower.
[253:16.40]Electronic gadget.
[253:18.60]Wait, why would I... Why would I take this?
[253:28.56]Just keep it there.
[253:29.24]I have to get the batteries for it anyways, right?
[253:33.60]So why even carry it?
[253:38.21]Like, I put batteries in it and put it on there, right?
[253:45.61]Why don't I just bring the batteries up here?
[253:46.83]If I have the inventory space.
[253:50.92]Okay, let's go into the star's office.
[254:03.56]So the only way to get in... ...is I gotta go up and get the... Okay.
[254:11.38]Yeah, we gotta blow through the fucking wall.
[254:17.40]I get it.
[254:17.74]Get the key from the guy, go get the thing, battery, bring it up here, blow the... Oh.
[254:25.93]I got another key.
[254:28.17]About rifle ammo?
[254:41.62]Got the key.
[254:48.09]Ban me.
[254:52.96]I even looked at him for a second.
[254:54.40]I looked at him.
[255:05.82]Okay, let's go open up the safety deposit room, get the battery out.
[255:09.23]I'm in caution right now.
[255:10.63]Fuck.
[255:23.08]Save it first.
[255:31.37]Do I have any more heals?
[255:34.58]I have this one, and there's a red herb in there.
[255:36.80]I'm going to take it out.
[255:40.00]I know I'm going to be in a scenario where I'm going to really want this shit.
[255:42.85]Let's go.
[255:46.83]Suck at this game.
[255:47.55]Laugh my ass off.
[255:49.55]What was the name of the thing that I just was trying to open up there?
[255:51.63]Start with a B?
[256:00.95]Bye-bye.
[256:06.18]I pressed M to look right when the jump scare happened.
[256:29.54]Oh, bye bye.
[256:33.72]If I got banned from a channel, and the streamer, whoever it was, did that, was like, oh, bye-bye.
[256:39.66]You know, I'd be like, I fucking hate this guy.
[256:48.91]Wouldn't you be like, oh, fuck this guy.
[256:50.89]Fucking dick.
[256:52.83]Oh, wow, look at you.
[256:54.17]You're so strong and powerful here in your stream.
[256:56.45]Oh, bye-bye.
[256:57.21]Fucking dick.
[256:58.08]That's why I... No.
[257:04.93]What was I doing right?
[257:05.73]Oh, right.
[257:06.03]Let's rewind it.
[257:06.85]Ahhhh!
[257:07.01]Got it.
[257:32.87]Into the storeroom.
[257:34.03]I wish I had my shotgun.
[257:40.72]Bye-bye.
[257:43.90]Okay, where is this battery?
[257:45.80]106.
[257:50.48]Ooh!
[257:53.74]Wait, that's the battery?
[257:55.52]Just a regular-ass Duracell?
[258:18.54]Nice entrance, dude.
[258:21.06]Okay.
[258:21.90]Anybody else in here that wants to cause a fucking problem before I start opening doors?
[258:25.27]108 has nothing.
[258:26.91]203 has nothing.
[258:27.39]Alright.
[258:29.61]The code is 104 and 106.
[258:59.75]Thank you.
[259:03.52]Battery.
[259:05.82]Hmm.
[259:07.18]Ammo. 109.
[259:29.05]Grenade.
[259:33.79]And... No keycard for this?
[259:38.86]Oh, well.
[259:41.00]There's still stuff... There's something in here still.
[259:44.80]What's still in here?
[259:45.48]Apparently there's something else in here.
[259:54.19]Oh.
[259:56.49]Okay.
[259:59.10]Let's go up in them.
[260:24.78]Ooh!
[260:25.36]DCM.
[260:26.27]Third floor locker.
[260:27.11]Let's go do it.
[260:38.63]Break through the glass.
[260:46.78]Save it, save it, save it, save it, save it.
[260:54.72]Ooh, heal right here.
[260:55.98]I told you I was gonna need this.
[261:02.02]Okay, I'm going to switch to the handgun, man.
[261:03.78]I have so much handgun ammo.
[261:05.34]I'm okay with this.
[261:06.92]I'll have to use it anyways.
[261:08.69]Alright, save it.
[261:13.91]Everybody has weed.
[261:14.89]Everybody has weed.
[261:19.09]Whether I did or I didn't.
[261:23.98]In Las Vegas.
[261:27.22]Marijuana is 100% legal.
[261:30.67]It's legal in the state, in the city of Las Vegas.
[261:35.28]Didn't know.
[261:37.32]Third floor.
[261:42.73]Was it DCM?
[261:47.97]What was it?
[261:48.97]What was it?
[261:50.09]Disaron on the rocks?
[261:56.34]Open.
[262:00.51]Not really worth it.
[262:06.55]20 bullets.
[262:10.97]He lives in Las Vegas.
[262:12.07]Yeah, he's definitely high.
[262:16.11]Excuse me.
[262:17.69]Alright, let's go put the battery in.
[262:23.97]You're committing a felony.
[262:30.53]Well, um... I'm committing a felony in the jurisdiction of my state.
[262:39.17]I reside.
[262:46.05]He is actually high.
[262:48.65]When?
[262:48.99]When?
[262:49.55]When?
[262:49.93]When?
[262:50.85]Where?
[262:51.15]I mean, I take a little bit of CBD for pain.
[262:56.71]Just a little.
[262:59.78]Just a little.
[263:03.69]This thing is... This thing's done.
[263:06.95]Crash it.
[263:10.29]Let's move.
[263:12.61]Admission.
[263:13.07]We already talked about this, like, yesterday.
[263:14.83]Ah, got.
[263:22.77]Grow up.
[263:24.73]Alright, guys.
[263:25.67]Grow up.
[263:27.39]Alright, we're, uh... We need to go.
[263:31.27]Uh, up.
[263:32.49]Uh, down.
[263:33.07]Up.
[263:33.61]Down.
[263:34.53]Up.
[263:35.21]Second floor.
[263:39.36]And then over here.
[263:41.92]Put the battery into the men's room.
[263:47.78]Not gonna get stuck with some guy.
[263:49.72]Do we know what that locker is?
[263:51.10]Alright, battery time.
[264:04.43]Detonator.
[264:09.27]CB.
[264:13.60]Let's go.
[264:17.36]That's not safe.
[264:22.96]You stood right next to the blast, man.
[264:24.76]That's like not the place you wanted to be.
[265:02.21]Oh, he's got comedy dialog.
[265:03.36]I like it.
[265:35.64]Okay.
[265:45.32]Can we stop this now, please?
[265:50.58]First aid's way.
[265:51.42]Okay.
[265:52.70]It's alright.
[265:53.42]Good.
[265:57.07]Now.
[265:58.19]Into the office.
[265:58.97]Watch out.
[265:59.35]There's gonna be... I have a knife on me.
[266:24.03]That's it.
[266:24.93]You're not gonna get up, right?
[266:25.83]Take out the big gun.
[266:32.92]I'm gonna go all the way to the end of the hallway and it's gonna be a mistake.
[266:55.52]Alright, let me in.
[266:56.18]I had no idea the Jerma could pog this hard.
[267:03.42]I won't believe it.
[267:12.98]Dr. Bard.
[267:16.36]Oh, thank God.
[267:17.28]Did you know how long I've been trying to reach somebody?
[267:20.25]Don't worry.
[267:20.67]We're going to get you out of there.
[267:21.63]Just tell me where you are.
[267:23.41]I'm trapped in a goddamn hospital surrounded by every kind of abomination.
[267:28.49]Look, just send in S.T.A.R.S.
[267:29.90]They're gonna know what to do.
[267:31.30]No, I'm negative.
[267:32.48]Our P.D.'
[267:32.86]'s overrun too.
[267:34.48]Then figure it out!
[267:36.46]Wow.
[267:37.52]Umbrella's gone crazy.
[267:38.68]They're killing all the researchers.
[267:41.38]I am the only one who knows how to make the vaccine to stop the zombies.
[267:46.78]So you can either sit there with your dick in your hand or send... send somebody who's capable of getting me the hell out of here.
[267:55.46]I like him already.
[267:58.20]Yeah, you would.
[268:01.50]You heard what he said.
[268:03.12]We can't turn him over to the company.
[268:04.76]That's not our call to make.
[268:06.60]That's Mikhail's call.
[268:08.65]I'm gonna check the computer, see if I can trace the doc's location.
[268:13.39]What do I do?
[268:15.11]He didn't give me instructions.
[268:16.55]This'll take some time.
[268:17.89]Look around, see if you can find anything useful.
[268:26.68]The screen just went... Flash grenade.
[268:34.60]Wait, did I make... Oh, I can't.
[268:36.04]I made the PC joke last game two years ago.
[268:38.88]I can't do it again.
[268:39.74]That would be not... That would be bad.
[268:42.92]That would be not funny.
[268:44.02]It would be stupid.
[268:50.94]50 bullets.
[268:51.38]Holy shit.
[268:54.92]That's a lot of ammo.
[268:59.14]Let's see if I can find anything useful while he hacks the computer.
[269:10.80]Hey, I think I found something.
[269:14.29]Report on the mansion.
[269:16.85]On July 23rd, Bravo team was dispatched to the mountains to investigate a series of grisly murders.
[269:21.49]They went radio silent.
[269:24.17]Incident culminated in the destruction of the mansion.
[269:25.79]There were numerous casualties.
[269:27.35]However, all evidence was destroyed along with the mansion.
[269:29.36]No further investigation.
[269:30.40]It was very difficult to do that.
[269:35.34]Is that Jill in the front row?
[269:42.06]Aim on.
[269:44.02]Aim on.
[269:44.42]Alright, I'm going.
[269:46.66]Aim on, for fuck's sake.
[269:52.76]Now, anything else useful in this place?
[269:54.30]Uh-huh.
[269:58.82]Good.
[270:00.48]Uh, storage box.
[270:03.32]Well, I can destroy this.
[270:07.23]Or... Uh, I'm gonna store one of the first aid kits.
[270:17.27]The flash grenades are kind of good.
[270:19.63]They work out pretty well.
[270:22.69]I have looked at everything here, so I can't do anything else.
[270:24.69]So I guess I'm just going to leave.
[270:26.77]Good luck.
[270:31.16]Back to the shower room.
[270:35.92]Can you say happy birthday to John?
[270:37.32]Hey, John, happy birthday.
[270:39.28]John, yeah, yeah.
[270:41.99]John, yeah, yeah.
[270:43.31]Jill?
[270:45.83]Ah, shit.
[270:48.29]Wait, what?
[270:49.81]Happy birthday to you, John.
[270:50.93]Jill, what happened?
[270:53.07]Jill, come in.
[270:55.79]T, I gotta go.
[270:56.39]Do what you gotta.
[270:57.88]I'll take care of Bard.
[271:02.30]New day.
[271:04.56]New day.
[271:09.54]Several minutes earlier.
[271:10.66]Oh, here we go.
[271:12.97]It's my turn.
[271:22.07]Alright, for a second, I thought that was Nemesis.
[271:24.17]And it was gonna be one of those scenarios where she's like, oh, I'm just getting up.
[271:28.54]Oh no, it's the scary guy.
[271:30.50]That would've been kind of cool.
[271:34.72]I don't think you would've laughed at that.
[271:39.62]Go.
[271:39.72]I'm gonna have to go for a pee break here in a second.
[271:52.26]Probably right now.
[271:57.07]Ooh.
[271:58.05]Mine rounds.
[271:59.83]What do the mine rounds do?
[272:02.89]Okay.
[272:21.41]Got a lot of bullshit.
[272:22.27]Where is this key?
[272:37.34]Don't need that much healing.
[272:46.07]Stop!
[272:53.73]Stop it.
[272:54.07]Okay.
[272:58.49]This is fine.
[273:01.91]Nothing out of the way.
[273:03.03]There's a lot of random shit in here.
[273:04.45]Hold on.
[273:06.95]Bullets in here.
[273:09.80]Mine rounds.
[273:10.92]More first aid.
[273:11.78]Why are you giving me all this stuff?
[273:12.78]There's a boss coming up.
[273:14.78]New weapon notice.
[273:16.60]It's called mine rounds.
[273:19.56]They're tough to find and tricky to handle.
[273:21.16]They're worth it.
[273:23.60]Standard issue grenade launchers don't get cute and try to load them in anything else fire them at walls or the ground and they'll stay X anything approaching and it will explode when they get in range.
[273:33.55]It's like a little sticky bomb.
[273:35.03]Alright Time to pee I will be right back
[278:15.79]I have returned.
[278:20.34]Good to see you again.
[278:21.18]I refilled my drink.
[278:26.04]Nice water with some tea in it.
[278:28.86]Nice light tea.
[278:35.97]Are people giving subs?
[278:38.77]Reduces Ahsan.
[278:39.73]Thanks for the five community subs.
[278:41.25]And Labster.
[278:43.37]Both of you back-to-back five.
[278:45.97]Thanks a lot.
[278:49.29]I peed.
[278:49.61]Yeah, I peed and refilled my drink.
[278:53.96]Get back to it.
[278:58.02]Hello.
[279:00.71]Alright, so we left off where I was thinking about what the hell I was going to do.
[279:08.39]Don't need three heals.
[279:13.09]I better be good on heals or that's going to be embarrassing.
[279:17.62]Save it.
[279:17.90]Let's go.
[279:23.68]So we're going out here.
[279:25.02]Shotgun or... I'm going to abuse the grenade launcher.
[279:37.63]I know it.
[279:52.47]Hey!
[279:55.13]Oh, that sucks.
[279:56.95]Sucks!
[279:58.17]Oh, that stinks.
[280:01.47]Oh, I have to kill you all?
[280:03.91]Oh, I don't.
[280:04.25]I don't know, there's maybe something on the beds.
[280:18.54]That was three headshots in a row.
[280:19.70]Give me a break.
[280:23.08]I'm out of ammo.
[280:29.67]Hurry up, this is a long game.
[280:31.03]Stop pretending.
[280:32.31]We're like 70% of the way through the game right now.
[280:34.45]What are you talking about?
[280:36.15]It's only been like four and a half hours.
[280:37.35]You know what?
[280:41.09]Sometimes you gotta use it.
[280:41.89]This is one of those times.
[280:55.50]Ten percent.
[281:09.96]Well, does he actually come and chase me?
[281:11.93]Escape the creature again?
[281:16.01]Where is he?
[281:16.37]He's in a boat?
[281:20.11]That'd be so funny if he like- if he just rode over in a gondola.
[281:23.85]That would be fucking hilarious.
[281:38.34]There's so much shit over here.
[281:39.74]He's... Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[281:45.20]Is he in there?
[281:55.08]I'm ready with the grenade launcher.
[281:56.21]I'm not messing around.
[281:56.83]I'm gonna use this shit.
[281:57.89]I'm not gonna save it at the end of the game.
[281:59.43]Just win.
[282:04.73]Well, he made some kind of mistake.
[282:07.21]Oh, my calculations were off.
[282:08.95]It was two milligrams of sulfuric acid.
[282:12.51]Fucking idiot.
[282:15.75]Well, I saw her do it.
[282:18.19]She did A and B together.
[282:21.93]I don't understand why this was so hard.
[282:25.98]How do I fuck it up?
[282:40.99]Is this nemesis I don't remember him turning into this shit
[283:18.90]Nemesis, why are you so huge?
[283:20.76]Good thing I got explosive rounds to kill you.
[283:32.89]BURN HIM!
[283:34.33]Excuse me!
[283:53.86]Thank you.
[283:56.59]Oh!
[284:46.31]I don't know what to do with these
[285:20.48]Still going?
[285:21.04]Did I stop him in his... Fuck!
[285:42.85]Fuck!
[285:45.07]What am I supposed to do?
[285:46.05]Shoot him?
[285:52.50]I don't have any guns
[286:29.99]He's doing this shit again.
[286:30.98]Alright, get... Should I not even shoot the gun?
[286:45.99]He's doing this again.
[286:51.07]He's like, I'm going off the top rope.
[286:56.22]Knocked up.
[286:56.88]Knocked the tower down.
[286:58.80]Knocked down the tower.
[287:00.96]Knock down the tower!
[287:04.48]Oh shit!
[287:04.99]I just got more.
[287:13.78]Should I wait till he climbs again?
[287:29.86]Okay, alright, here he goes.
[287:30.95]He's doing the mercy.
[287:36.29]Climb the tower and powerbomb him.
[287:38.03]Off the tower.
[287:38.71]I figured it out!
[287:54.31]I know how to do it.
[287:55.79]Okay, I figured it out.
[287:56.35]I figured it out.
[287:56.91]Okay.
[288:22.54]That face!
[288:38.40]No, don't!
[288:39.14]I wanna- I- He's never gonna stop.
[288:44.18]Yes, of course I'm throwing because I've used every bullet I had when I just had to make him run into the wall.
[288:54.02]I'm not going to deplete literally a hundred rounds of ammo.
[288:58.78]No, I want to redo it.
[289:01.04]Handgun ammo?
[289:01.78]That's not going to help me.
[289:05.30]Go in the cars.
[289:06.14]Yeah, but I wasted like 15 shots.
[289:14.55]That's too much of a waste.
[289:23.97]Where is he?
[289:28.41]Okay.
[289:30.43]Alright.
[289:31.12]Good.
[289:32.52]Excuse me.
[289:33.76]Let's get him to run.
[289:55.63]Did I miss?
[289:56.03]No, I got him.
[289:56.75]Alright.
[289:57.25]We got to get to the other.
[289:58.07]How do I change E?
[290:00.67]Mine round.
[290:09.41]Excuse me, sir.
[290:15.37]E. Actually, let's do some collecting.
[290:16.42]Collect.
[290:17.12]Collect.
[290:20.16]He's going to start running around, and you've got to stop him in his tracks.
[290:23.27]Here he goes.
[290:24.45]Oh, he still wants to fight.
[290:25.55]Good boy.
[290:33.68]What the... No.
[290:35.32]I...
[290:54.08]Alright, do it!
[291:08.60]He's not doing it.
[291:12.12]Do the runaround.
[291:12.84]How much more damage do I have to give him before he does this?
[291:21.97]Oh, shit over here.
[291:25.12]Can't pick it up.
[291:36.79]Start running!
[291:39.53]Start running on the walls.
[291:40.69]Go for it.
[291:55.06]Here he goes.
[291:58.19]Here it is.
[291:58.53]Here it comes.
[291:58.87]Here it comes.
[291:59.17]Alright.
[291:59.41]Alright.
[291:59.63]Here we go.
[291:59.87]Ready?
[292:00.03]I'm ready.
[292:02.15]Jump up and start running.
[292:04.09]Here he goes.
[292:05.79]He's going.
[292:06.91]He's up.
[292:07.65]He's on the wall.
[292:08.67]Alright.
[292:08.93]Here we go.
[292:10.61]Get that shotgun out.
[292:33.00]Run!
[292:40.17]Okay.
[292:46.82]Any more mine rounds lying around somewhere?
[292:51.08]Pissed?
[293:03.55]Mine runs right there.
[293:09.02]Oh!
[293:09.32]Hit him in the egg sack.
[293:33.32]That was fucking close.
[293:35.04]Alright, fuck off.
[293:40.99]Climb.
[293:41.41]He goes.
[293:56.39]Cock gun, get it out.
[294:05.88]Yeah, that was much more optimized.
[294:15.97]You're right.
[294:16.31]That was very optimized.
[294:22.17]Okay.
[294:23.31]Now take the time.
[294:27.42]Take the time now to use your knife and just cut him into tiny pieces.
[294:37.76]You're not going to come back.
[294:41.76]Beam up Carlos and say, Hey, can you meet me in front of the police station and bring your knife?
[294:47.90]We're going to carve this guy up into a fucking thousand pieces.
[294:51.69]And you're going to take half in a backpack and I'm going to take half in a backpack.
[294:56.89]So there's no way it can be combined.
[295:01.21]That's what I would do.
[295:02.49]I'm serious.
[295:03.86]I would sit here and...
[295:12.34]That's fucked up.
[295:13.50]Is it though?
[295:32.30]I missed a bunch of ammo.
[295:33.70]I didn't know I was going to go into a cutscene right there.
[295:44.91]Oh, it poisoned.
[295:45.87]Where the hell...?
[295:51.73]Roughly half a day later.
[296:15.78]Holy shit, Carlos.
[296:19.78]Is that implying that, like, holy shit, dude, that was a long time?
[296:25.78]Alright, I'll meet you there.
[296:43.80]Do I have to run?
[296:45.96]Do I have to carry Jill?
[296:48.70]That'd be bad, isn't it?
[296:52.10]I'm not looking forward to this.
[296:53.81]Okay, thank God.
[296:54.93]Thank God.
[296:55.39]I wouldn't have wanted to do that at all.
[297:06.98]Hey, Moth.
[297:19.48]Search for a vaccine.
[297:25.25]Okay, I'm gone.
[297:25.55]I'm on it.
[297:49.51]Uh, Carlos McCulkin is on the case.
[297:52.21]I don't know what his last name is.
[297:54.45]Uh... Should I?
[298:05.88]No.
[298:08.40]By the way, I just combined Macaulay Culkin's name.
[298:11.72]I don't even realize I just did that.
[298:13.14]That's what I did.
[298:18.48]I don't know why.
[298:20.39]Why Macaulay Culkin?
[298:23.25]Every person on Earth.
[298:25.29]On everybody on the planet.
[298:28.49]There's like... There's like seven... There's like ten billion people on Earth.
[298:34.06]Tyrell, where's Bard now?
[298:36.42]Gotta be the lab in the back.
[298:38.00]Stay frosty, I'm on my way.
[298:40.26]Copy.
[298:41.36]I'll go on ahead.
[298:44.68]What is it?
[298:45.06]7.4 or 7.3, whatever it is.
[298:52.36]I round up.
[298:52.82]Okay, here we go in the hospital.
[299:01.64]Game on?
[299:02.49]No.
[299:04.21]No game on.
[299:11.23]No, I only will game on if you allow me to do my John Oliver impression.
[299:16.76]When he compares somebody to an animal.
[299:19.92]And looks over on his right and addresses the imaginary animal that he's talking about.
[299:29.47]Okay, do I have permission?
[299:30.15]Okay.
[299:32.13]I don't want to do that, Mr. Turtle!
[299:33.96]I don't want to see that!
[299:35.04]And I don't want you to come into my house!
[299:36.88]Okay, game on.
[299:59.59]I've just been walking back and forth, saving.
[300:01.27]I told you, it's not what you think it is.
[300:06.35]I walked in and out of that room and saved.
[300:08.43]Like, fucking... I think it's there.
[300:10.40]I thought that was Peter Griffin for a second.
[300:13.08]It is Peter... No, it's not.
[300:15.36]Alright, that was... That's Peter Griffin, running by that.
[300:18.96]Okay.
[300:20.44]Uh, let's go.
[300:46.75]I'm a much better shot with crystal.
[300:48.71]Always have been.
[301:01.92]Oh my god!
[301:28.07]I don't see it right.
[301:33.63]Don't move.
[301:39.94]Alright, let's go through this door over here.
[301:42.04]The heart of Raccoon City's healthcare, the forefront of science.
[301:51.87]Something about state-of-the-art outpatient facilities.
[301:57.94]I need a lockpick.
[301:59.24]Can I get it from Jill?
[301:59.92]Is that too much to ask?
[302:12.66]Emergency vaccine research.
[302:17.36]Hold on.
[302:19.64]There's a case in there.
[302:32.39]What's that sound?
[302:38.59]Got it.
[302:39.51]That scared the shit out of me but I got it.
[302:40.89]A player.
[302:58.00]Oh, is this... I know what... I get it.
[303:00.29]So I've got to record him giving his master plan or whatever, and then play it back in front of this.
[303:14.81]Right?
[303:16.49]Like, hey, it's me!
[303:17.65]Password!
[303:18.39]Fire!
[303:18.73]Fire!
[303:19.90]Yeah, I've got to... Okay.
[303:21.24]I've got to record somebody talking.
[303:24.10]That's true.
[303:24.70]I really hope I never have that technology.
[303:28.12]Anywhere near any of the stuff that I care about.
[303:31.36]Because you guys could just, like, play a fucking YouTube clip of me talking.
[303:55.94]You could just string together a sentence of, like, please open the door.
[303:58.72]It's me, Jeremy Elbertson.
[304:01.88]Why do we want, like, voice technology?
[304:04.36]It'd be so easy.
[304:20.47]I know he's gonna break the glass.
[304:21.71]It's just a matter of when.
[304:26.82]Oh, you missed it.
[304:33.93]Get out!
[304:34.29]No, he's in.
[304:34.67]I don't have a keycard.
[304:46.49]You even.
[304:56.00]Alright, I can't open that door.
[304:58.02]Let's go... That's a window that's open.
[305:14.90]This is locked too?
[305:15.64]Fuck.
[305:17.05]Well, what am I supposed to do?
[305:22.23]This is locked?
[305:23.87]This is locked.
[305:28.35]the stairs I guess this is left for dead level there's a left for dead level that's exactly like this right
[306:06.04]Not after all the bullshit.
[306:17.84]Okay.
[306:19.08]Now we're back this way.
[306:21.34]Alright, let's go down this hall.
[306:26.84]Staff only.
[306:29.48]Thought that was gonna be a... Oh, alright.
[306:35.05]Ooh, what's this?
[306:36.15]Nurse's journal.
[306:41.65]Mystery illness.
[306:43.91]Dr. Young got bitten.
[306:49.76]Do some consolidation.
[306:53.62]Yeah.
[306:54.16]Way too many health packs here.
[306:59.24]Keep two.
[307:01.86]Hopefully I find another green one.
[307:05.04]Alright, that's fine.
[307:05.80]Imagine not being staffed.
[307:10.60]Oh, well, there's one right there.
[307:18.26]I might just use this now.
[307:19.62]I can take one more, two more bites.
[307:27.94]Alright.
[307:29.06]That leaves me with... There's something else in here.
[307:31.32]I need to be touched.
[307:34.20]or looked at, picked up.
[307:36.98]And what is it?
[307:37.38]50 saves, by the way.
[307:51.81]How many of those were actually real?
[307:55.07]I will never know.
[307:56.11]Okay, right here.
[308:15.37]I don't have a lockpick.
[308:16.05]Does Jill come in here eventually?
[308:17.65]Journal.
[308:19.95]I swear, I tried to do it, but there's nothing else to be done.
[308:24.88]The chaos is completely beyond control.
[308:26.32]9pm, there's a helicopter above overhead, and immediately I started crying and hugging each other, thinking a rescue team was on the way.
[308:33.26]But then a sound grew distant, and we're all left now with the moaning of the dead and the silent screams of our hearts.
[308:39.73]Something's coming!
[308:43.36]Why won't he say God?
[308:44.36]I just like stumbled up.
[308:53.72]Ammo.
[309:05.35]Let's go.
[309:09.46]Memos.
[309:09.80]A lot of notes.
[309:11.10]ID cards are not to be taken off hospital grounds under any circumstances.
[309:15.50]All employees must store their ID in their own personal lockers before returning home.
[309:19.92]The key to the locker room has gone missing.
[309:21.70]Mm-hmm.
[309:25.00]Somebody dropped it in the courtyard.
[309:26.20]Oh, we need to go to the courtyard.
[309:34.55]Of course we do.
[309:38.51]I took it.
[309:40.11]Hey, there is staff in here.
[309:41.45]Imagine not being staff.
[309:51.42]Go to the courtyard.
[309:52.72]How would I get there?
[310:00.66]Is this open?
[310:01.15]I think... Yes, it was.
[310:13.44]What the hell is that?
[310:14.48]I don't like these sounds.
[310:21.51]Oh, is somebody coming through here?
[310:23.89]Okay.
[310:29.09]Those doors don't open.
[310:31.96]Safe.
[310:43.94]Oi!
[310:44.62]Whoa!
[310:48.79]Okay.
[310:57.89]Um... How do I get the hell out of here, then?
[311:04.46]Wait, why won't that door open?
[311:06.80]It will!
[311:11.00]Move, move, move!
[311:12.66]Get off me!
[311:13.70]They came out of that door!
[311:14.82]I just, I did a flashbang and I did it.
[311:16.18]It was so cool.
[311:32.82]I don't want them getting up.
[311:34.46]Shit!
[312:11.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[312:13.44]Something loose.
[312:14.08]Fuck, I have to do all this bullshit again.
[312:18.84]It won't open.
[312:19.52]I know.
[312:19.90]Look at this.
[312:20.30]I got a note for you.
[312:21.12]ID cards.
[312:23.42]Just kill them.
[312:24.30]And that's what I should have done.
[312:29.21]There's ammo over here.
[312:40.31]Punch him.
[312:43.42]Save more often?
[312:44.28]Yeah, I mean, I usually do.
[312:45.34]I've saved 50 times.
[312:48.20]It's not this dumbass time.
[312:49.86]You're gonna get your grade lowered to D?
[313:01.81]Um... As long as I get an F for finish.
[313:06.05]That doesn't bother me.
[313:10.59]Okay, back this way.
[313:17.31]Here we go.
[313:19.57]I am going to heal.
[313:20.61]I'm going to top myself off with this.
[313:23.64]Good.
[313:24.26]I'm ready.
[313:29.28]Same deal.
[313:29.88]Remember this part.
[313:30.64]They break out through the door.
[313:31.98]I'm going to throw a flashbang.
[313:33.06]And I'm going to do the thing I was supposed to do when I got here the first time.
[313:43.07]Here we go.
[313:53.00]Very nice.
[313:53.84]Alright.
[314:01.16]Cool.
[314:02.74]Hey!
[314:02.94]Hey!
[314:03.14]Whoa!
[314:03.46]They're coming this way!
[314:20.80]Somebody said, okay, for a second I thought you said Overwatch is the cure for baldness.
[314:24.80]And I was like, oh, that's a funny joke.
[314:25.96]But you said Overwatch is calling.
[314:30.74]Putting words in your mouth.
[314:32.80]Okay, what's in here?
[314:36.05]Nothing in this sick room.
[314:40.99]No.
[314:43.25]Gotta find my way to the courtyard.
[314:44.39]I gotta get to the courtyard.
[314:49.27]Are these lockers open?
[314:52.57]It's not like a machine I have to look at, right?
[314:57.39]Damn it, really?
[315:03.30]Can't open that door.
[315:14.61]The only place I haven't gone is over here.
[315:15.91]This is it.
[315:16.33]Ugh.
[315:24.48]How do I get out there?
[315:25.40]I gotta get down here.
[315:31.23]Alright, I gotta go back down.
[315:34.73]That's the way to the courtyard.
[315:35.65]So you just go down the stairs.
[315:38.67]Let's get the hell out of here.
[315:41.28]I have to walk all the way around.
[315:42.18]I have to go to the fucking roof.
[315:58.84]I made it.
[316:04.64]I found the key.
[316:10.54]And here it comes.
[316:12.78]Yeah.
[316:16.42]What is it?
[316:16.72]Is it going to be a snake?
[316:17.52]It's going to be a snake or something.
[316:22.07]It's a snake, isn't it?
[316:23.41]It's a snake.
[316:24.03]It's a giant snake.
[316:35.22]Oh, I thought he actually got bit by a snake or something.
[316:36.92]That's why I thought he was doing that.
[316:46.44]Like, no, no, I was, like, punching, but, like, with the first run, I thought it was him getting, like, bit by something in the bushes.
[316:52.51]Okay, here we go.
[316:55.33]I missed, um, whatever.
[316:56.73]I don't care.
[316:58.41]Now I gotta go back upstairs to here.
[317:02.33]Or the staff, which one was it?
[317:03.31]Staff room?
[317:08.03]Where was it?
[317:14.93]What's that save point, Jeremy?
[317:18.40]Get in there and save it.
[317:21.64]It just saved.
[317:22.72]Why did it just save?
[317:23.44]I know why.
[317:37.80]Here he comes.
[317:41.08]He's gonna come right now.
[317:46.04]He's pretty much on his way.
[317:47.48]He's pretty much ready to get you.
[317:48.96]Hey, does this work on a door?
[317:58.77]Wait, is that an herb?
[318:01.85]Oh, come on.
[318:02.29]That's an herb.
[318:07.57]Note about tape recording.
[318:09.68]I think I know what happened to the missing tape of Dr. B. His research assistant took it.
[318:17.66]Alright, the treatment room?
[318:19.38]Is this the treatment room over here?
[318:24.24]Alright, I gotta go back.
[318:47.59]I think it's this way?
[318:48.68]Aphrom?
[319:13.65]I heard some music cue, that means probably yes.
[319:17.47]It's aphorim.
[319:19.17]Okay.
[319:19.67]No.
[319:19.87]This is a safe point.
[319:20.51]Good.
[319:26.85]Secret stegums?
[319:27.37]Doesn't have to be a secret.
[319:32.55]I'm going to put you... No.
[319:34.21]Put you away.
[319:36.11]That means I only have one heal.
[319:49.24]Take two.
[319:51.16]Take two heals.
[319:51.64]Alright, kill it.
[319:57.68]You find yourself unable to cast sus because the stream is currently on now.
[320:02.92]You didn't know.
[320:03.40]Maybe you just jumped in thinking you were going to catch the VOD.
[320:07.19]Well, that would be nice to get a hospital map.
[320:12.05]Alright, well, at least I know everywhere I need to go.
[320:13.95]I know everywhere I need to go.
[320:23.59]Open this door.
[320:28.94]Yes.
[320:36.80]Holy shit, there's a lot of... This isn't going to be a dead body in one of these.
[320:45.70]There always is.
[320:47.10]Alright, got an ID card.
[320:54.69]You can't have a Resident Evil game where someone doesn't fall out of a locker.
[320:59.52]That's gonna happen in every single one of these.
[321:02.08]Without a doubt.
[321:05.16]Just have to go for it.
[321:06.50]Okay, so I got what I was looking for here.
[321:08.82]Now I go back with the... Put the keycard in the treatment room thing, get the tape, and then bring the tape over here, and then put the tape down.
[321:22.14]Yeah.
[321:23.88]I get it.
[321:34.96]It said, imagine watching a VOD for five hours.
[321:38.03]Imagine watching a stream for five hours.
[321:39.89]Aren't you here?
[321:51.04]What is that?
[322:10.35]Dodge!
[322:10.85]Dodge, you fucking moron!
[322:12.01]Dodge!
[322:13.46]Dodge him!
[322:21.02]Fucking grunting is so stupid.
[322:25.05]Okay, I'm fine.
[322:28.15]I'm fine.
[322:41.99]Punch him.
[322:43.19]Punch into his face.
[322:44.23]Save it.
[322:51.18]Good save.
[322:59.78]Into the nurse's station.
[323:00.90]Cut.
[323:06.16]I'm gonna use a grenade on the next one.
[323:08.37]Because I have a grenade and I might as well save some ammo.
[323:13.92]He's gonna drop from the ceiling over here somewhere.
[323:23.18]I'm ready.
[323:24.52]Come on, drop out of the tiles.
[323:34.95]Okay.
[323:41.76]Two in here.
[324:18.45]Just be dead.
[324:20.53]Good.
[324:21.17]Okay.
[324:22.55]He's getting in the damn way.
[324:23.75]Oh, wait!
[324:27.83]What happened to you?
[324:28.91]How did you get behind me?
[324:30.29]I thought... Was that the same person?
[324:40.30]That just gave me a stomachache.
[324:42.38]I just got a stomachache from that one.
[324:44.00]Okay, here we go.
[324:50.64]Oh, I still... I'll take it.
[324:53.10]I'm gonna be cautious.
[324:53.82]I'm gonna take it.
[324:54.32]Took it.
[324:57.04]I'm taking it.
[325:02.13]I want the better one.
[325:03.13]Give me this one.
[325:11.68]Ammo here.
[325:13.28]And a lock.
[325:14.22]I can't do anything about this.
[325:20.49]I'm definitely going to be coming back here with Jill then.
[325:23.21]Right?
[325:23.43]That's a fact.
[325:25.69]Alright, this is the part where there's two frogmen in here.
[325:47.04]He's standing behind the door, just...
[326:12.09]Kick it open.
[326:12.61]Holy shit!
[326:26.26]Wait a minute, I have a... Somebody spawned him in!
[326:45.06]Who's this guy that they spawned in?
[326:46.82]I bounced off his fucking head and came back at me.
[326:58.98]Okay.
[327:00.42]There's another one in here.
[327:14.61]Don't shh!
[327:33.13]This is what happens when I play with my friend from Australia.
[327:35.37]I do this for about 10 minutes.
[327:40.49]I say, nice talking to you again.
[327:42.07]And he leaves.
[328:17.47]Punch him!
[328:39.50]Why would you go back to... Get out of the way!
[329:04.68]Thank God I didn't have to use every bullet I had.
[329:07.42]Oh my goodness.
[329:13.04]This is what I came in here for, the tape.
[329:16.63]Put the tape in here!
[329:23.86]Alright.
[329:27.72]Now I have to go to that door and play... I don't have any... I have... Pistol, that's it.
[329:35.91]This is gonna get ugly if I have to fight anything else.
[329:37.57]What else is in here?
[329:42.09]Why is it still, um...
[329:45.97]Why is this red still?
[329:47.07]Anything else in here?
[329:51.31]Can I say pick up?
[329:51.99]Oh, alright.
[329:52.63]What's that?
[329:53.32]Thank you very much.
[329:57.32]Resident Evil 3 Master?
[329:58.74]Worst Face Nominee.
[330:00.82]Hold on.
[330:05.49]I'll be the judge of that.
[330:25.43]I mean, it's the fucking hair that makes this look weirder.
[330:31.61]It's this weird hair that I have.
[330:33.53]This is fucking 70s hair.
[330:41.55]Alright, let's go back.
[330:42.37]Oh, and now I just have to actually plug this thing in.
[330:47.21]Which that was...
[330:56.87]Here.
[330:59.01]We have to get down to the lab reception.
[331:01.27]So I gotta go down the stairs.
[331:02.81]Or from the courtyard.
[331:04.18]The courtyard works too.
[331:05.04]Let's just go to the courtyard.
[331:06.82]No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

[336:26.58]I don't know.
[336:26.92]I thought maybe I'd have to put the whole thing up there.
[336:29.31]They already got the audio they needed.
[336:30.63]Whatever.
[336:43.07]Bard.
[336:45.31]Tyrell.
[336:46.53]Bard's dead.
[336:47.88]He's been shot.
[336:50.04]Shit.
[336:50.68]And the vaccine?
[336:52.14]I'm looking.
[336:53.34]Well, look harder.

[337:26.48]Alright, we'll look for a vaccine.
[337:27.58]Okay, I found it.
[337:35.39]Oh, wait.
[337:38.39]There's ammo in here.
[337:41.41]And there's also, there's a first aid.
[337:42.49]Where's the first aid?
[337:43.15]In the middle?
[337:44.37]There it is.
[337:51.74]Alright, vaccine.
[337:53.20]Give it to me.
[337:55.57]Email from Nathaniel Bard.
[337:58.11]Greg, I know you're watching the news.
[337:59.31]The virus is going to devour the country.
[338:01.23]The dead will wash over the Capitol Hill into like a tidal wave.
[338:05.02]I have in my possession one dose of a vaccine for the virus.
[338:07.34]It's the Holy Grail and it's not for my family, not for my ladies.
[338:12.66]No, Greg, it's for you.
[338:14.86]I know better than anyone that you're the future of the United States.
[338:17.62]But if you want the goods, Greg, you have to get me the hell out of here now without Umbrella finding out.
[338:23.33]Lean on the Pentagon.
[338:23.99]I know you've got the clout.
[338:25.48]See if someone can get a rescue team here without UBCS involvement.
[338:31.14]Scratch my back, I scratch yours, which should sound pretty chasty.
[338:35.72]After the parties we've been to, hurry.
[338:37.80]My time is running out.
[338:42.16]This is VRC Chief Nathaniel Bard.
[338:45.16]September 29, 11 p.m.
[338:49.31]I am acutely aware that my time's running out.
[338:51.29]I just watched it.
[338:53.63]And I hope and pray, by making this recording and bringing the truth to light, that I can restore some small shred of honor to my name.
[339:04.69]All of Raccoon City's suffering began with the release of a biological weapon known as the T-Virus.
[339:13.18]My employer, the Umbrella Corporation, engineered this virus.
[339:17.48]And they ordered my team to develop a vaccine, which we did.
[339:20.92]Now, I keep samples of this vaccine here in my office.
[339:24.92]The rest of it is stored underground.
[339:26.62]I gotta go underground.
[339:29.70]But those sons of bitches at the board, they want to destroy it.
[339:34.76]They don't want the world to know what they've done.
[339:37.40]So they're trying to erase all evidence that the virus ever existed.
[339:45.73]No, I'm not a fool.
[339:47.45]I know they don't want me to... Mom came in to end my RP session.
[340:01.26]Oh, easy.
[340:01.82]Vaccine was in there, stupid!
[340:23.80]No, he's just a Counter-Strike pro.
[340:25.64]Remember from yesterday?
[340:29.36]Reminded.
[340:30.40]That joke.
[340:31.24]Right when he punched it.
[340:41.51]I got the vaccine.
[340:45.53]I'm not going to be able to walk back with this, am I?
[340:49.97]Probably not.
[340:53.23]T, I got it.
[340:55.45]Good.
[340:56.07]I'm headed your way.
[340:57.53]Be careful.
[340:58.89]Careful?
[341:00.51]Have you seen this town?
[341:02.13]It'll be a fucking miracle if I get there in one piece.
[341:21.77]I thought he was going to grab me.
[341:22.89]I thought he was going to grab me.
[341:24.33]I thought he was going to grab me.
[341:25.35]I thought he was going to just grab me so I was getting ready for it.
[341:27.37]Does it work on me too?
[341:41.21]Just close your eyes.
[341:56.99]Punch him!
[342:07.30]Fuck!
[342:09.34]Why am I stuck here?
[342:20.95]I'm ready this time.
[342:21.63]You didn't shake the Wii mode hard enough.
[342:28.64]Hang up on him.
[343:08.28]I don't even know what to say.
[343:11.48]He just spun me around.
[343:14.00]And... I don't know.
[343:16.94]That was like a fucking Warcraft rogue.
[343:22.05]Oh, he's just behind you now.
[343:23.95]And now he does a kidney shot and then he just fucking burns you and kills you.
[343:31.17]-2 wow reference.
[343:32.39]I've played it for fucking ten straight years.
[343:34.23]Of course it's gonna be in my brain sometimes.
[343:39.05]I gotta shoot this guy, I have to.
[343:49.32]I can't, it won't let you.
[343:56.57]Get a gun out!
[344:12.49]Oh my god, it's running so fast!
[344:27.86]Back to Jill.
[344:34.58]Where's Jill?
[344:36.24]There she is, in the makeshift sick room.
[344:38.54]I'm gonna go down here.
[344:54.03]I'm ready to run.
[344:54.55]What's this box?
[345:09.93]How do I get that box?
[345:23.66]Oh.
[345:24.54]It's just a zombie.
[345:31.63]It's gonna miss the safe?
[345:32.77]How do I get it?
[345:33.27]I don't think I can... I'm gonna miss it.
[345:53.43]Oh, upstairs safe.

[346:07.71]Hang on.
[346:08.03]I'm gonna go left and then left.

[346:19.62]Hopefully, there's no enemies I have to fucking fight.
[346:25.27]Please, nobody.
[346:26.03]Don't make this painful for me.
[346:28.65]I just want to get the hell out of here.

[354:09.53]Jeez.
[354:15.27]Tyrell.
[354:16.81]What the hell happened?
[354:19.30]Attention all citizens.
[354:20.88]The contagion spreading throughout the city has been designated uncontainable.
[354:24.51]On October 1st, Raccoon City will be completely destroyed in a missile strike.
[354:28.95]All residents capable of rational thought are urged to evacuate immediately.
[354:32.87]This is not a test.
[354:34.45]Attention all citizens.
[354:35.61]Man, that's only a day away.
[354:37.89]There's still people in the city.
[354:39.87]You think Uncle Sam gives a shit?
[354:42.71]Fuck.
[354:43.69]Here they come.
[354:45.29]You sit tight.
[354:46.89]I got this.
[354:51.03]Defend Jill.
[354:53.45]This is Left 4 Dead.
[354:54.63]Did he get some gear?
[354:58.72]Okay, here we go.
[355:09.30]I don't have any gear.
[355:13.49]Do we have any ammo?
[355:15.57]How am I supposed to defend this area without any weapons?
[355:32.53]They're not gonna drop down from the ceiling, right?
[355:50.48]I'm gonna try to lower the window shutters.
[355:52.18]The less entry points, the better.
[355:54.16]And how do we do that?
[355:55.58]I'll try hacking into the hospital security system.
[355:58.06]Keep them off me in the meantime.
[356:02.03]Thought they were gonna break in the door and defend Jill in the bed because Jill's like, here they come.
[356:14.42]Detonator!
[356:16.18]Alright, any more bullets?
[356:32.39]Alright, thank god.
[356:33.07]I was gonna say, how the hell am I supposed to do this with no bullets?
[356:45.04]Alright.
[356:46.08]Game time started.
[356:47.04]Oh, it's time for game night.
[356:54.79]I believe that's probably it, right?
[356:55.99]Should I detonate something?
[357:03.10]Actually, you know what?
[357:08.88]I guess I'm going to take it.
[357:18.51]What was that?
[357:19.69]Did I just get hit in the face by a bug?
[357:26.06]Why did I spin around like that?
[357:39.53]What?
[357:39.91]Where?
[357:40.27]Nobody breached anything.
[357:59.78]Detonator?
[358:00.26]How do I use it?
[358:09.29]How do I... How do I attach it?
[358:10.95]That guy wouldn't even load it into the game.
[358:24.35]They're not even loaded into the game.
[358:26.27]Oh, come on.
[358:39.12]Don't let him get in the room!
[359:07.84]Break her!
[359:12.11]Nice.
[359:14.09]Nice.
[359:15.00]Oh.
[359:20.92]There's a breaker in here?
[359:21.74]There's no fucking breaker in this room.
[359:24.54]I found it!
[359:29.72]Wait, that's just a light.
[359:30.57]That's a light switch.
[359:31.37]That's a breaker.
[359:37.11]That's a light switch.
[359:41.51]Oh, my God.
[360:13.55]Oh, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.
[360:15.21]Don't get up.
[360:34.92]OK.
[360:35.00]Did we win?
[360:53.86]Hey!
[361:00.82]Did you do it?
[361:02.98]Kind of waiting for you to finish.
[361:04.44]Okay.
[361:07.16]Dude, my man just despawned.
[361:11.01]I guess.
[361:18.59]I thought I was... Hold out until the explosion.
[361:22.31]What?!
[361:29.48]I'll make my own!
[361:30.14]Sometimes you gotta make your own explosions!
[361:49.64]Oh, come on.
[361:52.31]Get up.
[362:16.35]I'm not locked in here with you.
[362:18.73]You're locked in here with me!
[362:20.25]I could be that guy.
[362:21.35]You're right, I could be that guy.
[362:22.26]Vaccine's the real deal.

[363:15.47]Not just one.
[363:16.03]All of them.
[363:19.27]What happened?
[363:19.65]Was it a nightmare?
[363:45.23]Did I get bit too many times?
[363:56.51]Of course it was a dream.
[364:03.59]Where am I?
[364:05.17]What's going on?
[364:13.78]Attention all citizens.
[364:15.44]The missile strike on Raccoon City will occur in just hours.
[364:18.76]The payload is designed to eradicate all biological material.
[364:22.80]That's you.
[364:23.90]You included.
[364:24.68]No.
[364:26.59]It can't be.

[366:12.52]Where is he?
[366:13.81]He went underground.
[366:15.25]Barge stockpiled the vaccine, enough to give this city some hope.
[366:18.41]His ribs are going to explode.
[366:21.15]I'm going after him.
[366:22.11]Wait, did you see the broadcast?
[366:24.01]They're going to blow the city sky high.
[366:26.19]I'm trying to get a hold of someone, anyone with the clearance to stop it.
[366:29.96]Leave this mess to him.
[366:31.30]He's a professional.
[366:33.24]So am I.
[366:36.82]Head to the underground facility.
[366:40.96]What's this here?
[366:41.52]Okay.

[366:42.52]First and foremost.
[367:05.46]Okay.
[367:07.24]I need to get down to the underground facility.
[367:11.73]This thing's actually really cool.

[368:07.12]Magnum ammo.
[368:08.56]Right.

[368:17.28]That'll be part of my eight-hit kill on Nemesis.
[368:21.52]Coming up soon here, in about 20 to 30 minutes.
[368:24.26]This is definitely the end of the game.
[368:25.68]Alright, up here to the left.
[368:51.57]You guys told me there weren't any more of those.
[368:53.07]There are.
[368:57.27]There are.
[369:06.62]Six rounds, that's worth it.
[369:10.05]Alright, now we gotta go up here.
[369:16.21]No, not this way.
[369:18.87]Believed chat.
[369:21.13]Sometimes you feel like... Sometimes I feel like I should.
[369:23.22]I wish I could.
[369:24.94]Believe them.
[369:28.80]Wait.
[369:29.82]What am I doing?
[369:34.02]Hold on.
[369:35.86]Alright.
[369:36.64]Had to do a...
[369:46.02]He's farting.
[369:47.86]Oh, he's not farting.
[369:54.88]Can I get over there from where?
[370:06.98]Fart.
[370:09.60]There's two things there now.
[370:14.52]Drop from the upper level?
[370:15.42]Yeah.
[370:18.96]That's what I'm thinking.
[370:20.04]I just gotta go up there and drop.
[370:28.68]In a few moments here, I'm going to stand up and take a few minutes to stretch.
[370:34.04]Start to lock up a little bit.
[370:40.17]There's one of these guys behind here and there.
[370:43.61]Okay.
[371:01.39]Now I can drop down from where?
[371:07.64]Behind this door.
[371:08.83]Fucking guy's mine.
[371:10.49]I'll just take care of this guy.
[371:27.14]Uh... Was I seeing his reflection in the thing here?
[371:34.22]I thought he was behind this door.
[371:37.78]Holy shit.
[371:41.46]Oh, it's just a- okay.
[372:25.61]Shotgun.
[372:26.27]And where are you now?
[372:27.01]Okay.
[372:37.56]That's enough of that.
[372:38.28]I got a lot of bullets for that.
[372:39.50]Okay.
[372:44.82]Lots of shotgun shells.
[372:45.96]I got a ton of good ammo here.
[372:49.02]That is that.
[372:51.52]Save the game.
[372:52.34]Drop down.
[372:53.10]Get the briefcase.
[372:56.37]And then get the hell out of here.
[373:06.99]So where can I... Does it matter where I drop down?
[373:09.27]Does it have to be in a specific place?
[373:15.25]Wait, the linen room.
[373:18.91]I want to go in here.
[373:19.55]Is there something in here to open?
[373:21.23]Not this one.
[373:22.03]Hold on.
[373:26.48]There is a box in here.
[373:28.00]Somewhere.
[373:31.94]More mag ammo.
[373:42.45]That's a lot.
[373:44.55]Save it to the very last fight.
[373:45.71]It's coming up here in about 15 minutes.
[373:52.46]Alright.
[373:53.24]Which one do I have to fall down from?
[373:56.87]There's this one here, and this one there.
[374:10.24]It's this one here, right?
[374:11.78]Yeah, it is this one, isn't it?
[374:12.74]Because there's the... It's this one.
[374:15.70]Yeah, then you walk around, and...
[374:32.33]Wait, is that not correct?
[374:40.00]Fuck, that wasn't right.
[374:44.30]Purple gang, people happy.
[374:45.86]I have to crawl under a bed in the hallway.
[374:54.83]In that hallway?
[375:04.77]We're all under a bed in the hallway.
[375:11.56]This bed.
[375:11.94]This bed.
[375:21.44]This bed.
[375:22.62]This bed.
[375:25.64]Probably another one.
[375:26.58]Um...
[375:31.09]Second floor.
[375:32.25]Wait, on the second floor?
[375:33.59]Wait, I have to fall from a different angle or something?
[375:40.55]Crawl under a bed.
[375:41.79]Okay.
[375:46.86]Find out.
[375:49.96]That had too much sugar.
[375:50.98]Um... I don't know what the hell they are eating.
[375:59.58]I think I can squeeze by.
[376:01.89]How the fuck was I supposed to look at that?
[376:03.31]How would I ever know that?
[376:12.68]Here?
[376:12.92]Let's go.
[376:16.19]Ooh, it's funny.
[376:18.37]Eh, no.
[376:20.19]Alright.
[376:20.75]Was it worth it?
[376:21.59]Holy shit.
[376:24.67]Turns out, yeah, it was worth it.
[376:28.13]Turns out, that's the game changer right there, because now I have my end of the game, only use the magnum, end of the game weapon.
[376:33.90]Anything else in here?
[376:39.38]Alright, let's go.
[376:50.28]Smoke more crack, is what somebody said.
[376:52.02]Uh, don't do that.
[376:53.86]Do not do any of that, actually.
[376:55.76]Alright.
[376:56.78]Same deal as last time.
[376:57.88]I, um... Forget everything.
[377:02.09]Underground facility, which was... Here.
[377:04.39]Okay.
[377:04.63]I just have to go back this way.
[377:07.43]Take a right.
[377:13.34]And then take a right.
[377:15.70]And then go straight.
[377:16.32]And then take a right.
[377:20.97]Get up and stretch?
[377:21.65]Yes.
[377:21.85]When I go to this next area, I'm gonna get up.
[377:24.55]Wait.
[377:24.67]There's something in here.
[377:28.95]What have I not gotten?
[377:33.53]Explosive B. Shit.
[377:35.02]Hold on.
[377:35.34]Fine, but... Should I take a heal?
[377:38.34]Should I load this thing up?
[377:40.76]Reload it.
[377:53.15]Flame rounds?
[377:54.57]No.
[377:57.97]What do I get rid of?
[377:58.49]I did it all!
[378:05.97]I didn't even realize.
[378:06.76]The lockpick.
[378:07.34]I can just get rid of it.
[378:08.00]Holy shit.
[378:08.38]I thought I was going to need it.
[378:09.68]Now, Jan, you know we're at the end of the game.
[378:12.62]Oh, now it's certain.
[378:13.24]It's confirmed now that this is the last probably 30 minutes of the game.
[378:18.12]Lockpick is gone.
[378:19.02]It's over.
[378:19.38]Alright, let's go.
[378:28.76]out he's gonna get up he's gonna this he'll attack me no no maybe an hour yeah maybe alright I'll be right back I mean like two or three minutes I'm just gonna take a few moments to scratch it right back
[380:24.63]Okay.
[380:25.79]I am back.
[380:29.34]I am ready.
[380:29.98]We continue.
[380:35.48]Hold on, let me get this.
[380:40.20]He's so high.
[380:42.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[380:47.37]Need to go down, down, down, down, down.
[380:56.53]Give me the big guns.
[381:09.51]I knew it.
[381:16.41]I knew the second that I came down here.
[381:18.89]We were going to be here.
[381:21.12]What is this doing up here?
[381:22.04]I don't want to use this.
[381:23.94]Get rid of that.
[381:24.38]I don't want to have that equipped.
[381:25.90]What are you, crazy?
[381:29.66]Protest to demand the integration of links back into the channel.
[381:31.82]No.
[381:33.60]I don't even need to read the rest of that.
[381:35.16]I don't even need to read the rest of it.
[381:38.82]Alright, let's go.
[381:40.06]All the way to the underground.
[381:46.36]Is it?
[381:49.77]Make sure I got something good out.
[381:52.21]I'll keep... Mine rounds kind of suck.
[381:54.13]I'm gonna use them.
[382:15.32]Underground lab.
[382:23.31]Okay.
[382:27.41]Anything in here that I can pick up?
[382:33.20]Something, right?
[382:34.10]Yes, of course there is.
[382:36.16]Explosive B. I do crack, but ironically.
[382:42.84]I don't think you can ironically do crack.
[382:44.68]I think you just smoke crack.
[382:51.46]I think that's just what you're doing.
[382:59.17]Alright, I'm gonna get flanked.
[383:07.43]How is it no one in the hospital ever noticed all this?
[383:11.60]You know, behind a door that you had to pull a certain book.
[383:14.04]Nobody pulled that certain book.
[383:25.67]Why is this so familiar?
[383:26.52]I feel like I've been here.
[383:32.00]Have we been here?
[383:33.32]Fuck.
[383:39.80]Wait, I can just combine these.
[383:43.71]Acid rounds.
[383:44.35]Nice.
[383:45.45]Can I combine this?
[383:49.15]Should I take it?
[383:49.63]Half-Life 1, you did this.
[383:58.08]I mean, I'm talking about this game that I'm playing now.
[384:02.20]Pay attention to us.
[384:05.46]I am.
[384:05.80]I'm giving you equal time.
[384:16.32]Oh.
[384:18.73]Is this the final hip poach?
[384:21.05]Right when I needed it.
[384:21.63]That's great.
[384:27.73]Elevator notice.
[384:28.45]There's an issue with the box.
[384:31.63]If you encounter this problem and can't get the elevator running, please stay calm.
[384:34.58]Gather fuses from the subgenerators situated around the warehouse and use those to restore power to the main generator.
[384:40.22]You gotta go get subgenerators.
[384:41.72]Go pick up three subgenerators.
[384:45.18]See you when you come back.
[384:49.71]Look at this disorganized shit inventory.
[385:01.97]I got 12.
[385:02.59]I got 20 shots with that thing.
[385:13.34]I got three heals.
[385:14.16]Alright, just for that guy.
[385:18.90]Weapons up top.
[385:21.87]Can I rotate?
[385:26.99]I can't rotate.
[385:28.31]Heals down the right.
[385:32.24]And ammo over here.
[385:39.26]There.
[385:39.62]Are you, um... Are you happy?
[385:41.52]Give me what you want me to do.
[385:46.70]Free heals.
[385:48.10]Gunpowder.
[385:48.66]I don't have any other gunpowder, right?
[385:49.84]No.
[385:58.80]You're past your hourly steakums quota.
[386:00.77]You need to eat a steakums.
[386:04.80]Why are you guys so on board with Stackems?
[386:06.97]I thought that was a... I'm a... I'm a piece of crap thing.
[386:14.63]Locked?
[386:16.49]Need a key?
[386:16.97]Need a key?
[386:20.59]Of course it does.
[386:21.15]Let's go.
[386:27.56]That's Albert Wesker!
[386:30.74]It's not.
[386:31.18]It's the other guy.
[386:41.81]I feel like there's going to be a very big fight right now.
[386:46.97]Hope I'm ready for it.
[386:51.39]Can he see me?
[386:51.87]Can we start talking?
[386:55.67]Wave.
[386:56.72]Hi.
[386:57.00]Okay.
[387:01.94]What's in here?
[387:02.98]This is definitely a fight.
[387:04.70]There's no way this is not a boss fight.
[387:07.26]One million percent yes.
[387:18.84]He was just waiting for me to... Get the fuses.
[387:21.98]What's this thing?
[387:22.78]That won't die.
[387:53.62]They don't die?
[388:00.76]Get up on there and... What does that do?
[388:12.79]Take his fucking leg out.
[388:16.38]Take his other leg out.
[388:19.12]You can't kill these things.
[388:22.54]They don't die.
[388:36.41]Power source.
[388:41.64]Use number one.
[388:43.06]Got it.
[388:44.38]Or three.
[388:44.90]Good thing I had just enough.
[389:02.17]Ready.
[389:04.88]The other two are... There's one over there.
[389:07.32]There's not.
[389:09.02]Wait.
[389:16.04]Right here?
[389:18.98]What the fuck?
[389:31.43]Okay.
[389:33.21]Ooh, a safe house.
[389:37.15]Good.
[389:37.45]Handgun ammo.
[389:39.71]Is that it?
[389:45.95]That's it that's in there?
[389:46.61]Okay.
[389:46.83]Irma Otto, you stink.
[389:57.31]Alright, so how... I guess I can go... Wait a minute.
[389:59.77]Can I go around?
[390:00.27]No!
[390:04.21]Alright, fool me once, shame on you.
[390:05.85]Fool me twice, shame on you both times for using that same shitty fucking game design tactic.
[390:10.72]I'm never at fault here.
[390:37.13]I can squeeze through there, but what about back here?
[390:42.47]I can go up this.
[390:43.19]This is probably... Can I go up this?
[390:50.50]Wait, what?
[390:52.90]Wait, wait, what?
[391:07.28]Maybe one day it'll come back.
[391:08.78]For like 10 minutes.
[391:11.96]Just for fun.
[391:15.15]At what point do I unlock something for that?
[391:17.97]That's what those are for, right?
[391:20.63]That's what those do?
[391:21.25]What did that do?
[391:34.00]Oh.
[391:35.54]Wait, I don't want to get on it yet.
[391:55.22]Oh, it's one of those weirdos.
[391:56.24]It's one of the weirdos.
[391:57.17]It's one of these weirdos.
[392:01.71]Wait, there's something over there.
[392:02.59]I don't fucking care who gets the memo.
[392:26.98]Yeah.
[392:36.78]Alright.
[392:37.22]Nice.
[392:37.54]This is right here.
[392:46.27]Store some of these because I don't need them.
[392:49.01]Too many.
[392:51.49]Use.
[392:51.79]I can reload that.
[392:55.63]Plenty of health.
[392:58.75]Okay.
[393:00.33]This.
[393:02.73]Reload the shotgun and let's go.
[393:07.68]Do wait what on July 30th?
[393:09.06]Not a bad idea.
[393:15.89]It's not a bad idea.
[393:18.11]Okay.
[393:18.55]Back out here.
[393:31.99]What do you do with these guys?
[393:33.33]What's the plan here?
[393:35.53]What's the plan?
[393:36.19]I've got a lot of time to examine them.
[393:40.27]But he's speaking.
[393:41.51]He's trying to communicate.
[393:42.49]Needs to be a magnum in the head.
[393:56.86]Oh!
[393:57.82]Feels good, doesn't it?
[394:12.94]You just jump scared chat.
[394:17.45]Lean to.
[394:22.33]Shell holder?
[394:23.13]Faster reload speed.
[394:29.46]Really?
[394:34.04]Reloads faster.
[394:36.24]I'm going to need to heal in a second though.
[394:37.58]Alright, let's go.
[394:44.32]It was Pog.
[394:44.96]Relax.
[394:46.34]I know it was Pog.
[394:52.62]Look, I know a Pog when I see one.
[394:56.92]Free Pog.
[395:05.24]Alright.
[395:06.72]Looking for another one of these fuse boxes, which I see one over here.
[395:13.95]Turn this on.
[395:23.02]Okay.
[395:27.66]And there's one right there.
[395:29.98]Go get it.
[395:30.40]Ooh.
[395:33.49]Okay, I can make more shotgun shells with that.
[395:39.65]Just finished a project.
[395:40.45]I can finally just chill and watch.
[395:41.73]Hey, what's up?
[395:45.46]Welcome to the stream.
[395:54.68]I gotta be prepared to shoot.
[395:55.82]What are you afraid of?
[396:06.14]Oh, that's what you're afraid of.
[396:33.37]Whoa.
[396:36.59]Whoa.
[396:41.14]That was fucking scary.
[396:48.43]That's apparently all I have to say about it.
[396:55.17]I'm going to heal now.
[397:04.95]That was horrible.
[397:05.83]Let's go.
[397:06.17]What about in this little container?
[397:08.75]Ooh, we do have some stuff in here.
[397:13.83]Gunpowder, gunpowder, gunpowder, gunpowder.
[397:15.84]Alright.
[397:20.70]Do I make a bunch of shotgun shells, or do I have, like, 30 to 40 rounds in the magnum?
[397:39.90]What's your favorite flavor of gunpowder?
[397:44.76]Blue raspberry.
[397:45.53]Okay, there's two.
[397:54.70]Where's this last one?
[397:58.46]There's one more.
[398:13.34]Blue raspberry sucks.
[398:16.68]Why?
[398:16.84]What's wrong with it?
[398:24.82]I'm just trying to look and see where the last one is.
[398:26.80]In there?
[398:27.12]Okay, down there, I can go that way, maybe?
[398:31.36]Up there and around?
[398:32.12]Alright.
[398:44.87]Who's making that noise?
[398:49.25]Can I get in?
[398:49.75]Wait a minute.
[398:50.33]Can I go down?
[398:52.24]If I go this way... Does this connect?
[398:55.64]It does.
[398:56.06]Yeah.
[398:56.26]I remember this fucking weirdo.
[398:58.04]Um... If I go down... No.
[399:05.40]Try this way first.
[399:08.00]It could be like a... Right there.
[399:11.68]Right fucking there.
[399:12.36]Can I sneak by?
[399:15.91]Did I press this button?
[399:16.77]Not yet.
[399:22.24]Wait.
[399:22.76]Okay, I gotta climb down that.
[399:23.82]So I gotta go that way.
[399:25.30]How do I get on that side?
[399:39.99]Wait, can I...
[399:47.08]Oh, there's a door right here.
[399:47.98]Go, go, go, go!
[400:08.49]Holy fuck, where did he go?
[400:09.55]I don't even know which way I...
[400:19.68]It's fucked up!
[400:24.48]What am I doing on health?
[400:25.08]I'm fine.
[400:25.40]Alright, this is the last one.
[400:29.68]Three fuses.
[400:38.63]Time to put the power back on.
[400:46.76]Which is under there.
[400:52.36]How do you like the game so far? I think it's good. I think it's a good game.
[400:56.00]Watch out for this guy, right? Okay. I think it's good. Do I think it's-
[401:08.00]I mean I gotta be honest do I think it's even remotely close to the second game remake?
[401:18.19]It's fun to play.
[401:19.25]It's a fun game.
[401:20.67]But I don't think it's even close to RE2 Remake.
[401:23.46]So if Resident Evil 2 Remake was like a 9.6 for me, like a 9.4, this is probably like a 7.1.
[401:44.69]Like, it's still a good... I think it's still a good game.
[401:47.35]I think it's still a fair game.
[401:51.55]What's missing?
[401:53.15]Um... Nemesis.
[401:59.04]I feel like he's kind of just showed up to... Because in the last game, like, he would kind of chase... Mr. X would chase you around, and you'd get attacked, and he was always a presence.
[402:09.72]In this one, he just kind of...
[402:11.00]A cutscene will happen, he'll like grab you and then you kind of have to run away from him for a few minutes.
[402:16.00]It's like- it's- they like show their hand before he makes an appearance.
[402:20.00]Because before Mr. X would just fucking show up.
[402:23.00]Like you'd be doing something, you'd be on like the typewriter, you turn around he'd just be there.
[402:25.00]And it's like holy fuck. That's the guy!
[402:27.00]But this one it's like: Cutscene! I'm here!
[402:31.00]And you're like, alright, he's here. And then you have to run away from him.
[402:35.00]So... I think if nemesis was a little more interesting to have encounters with...
[402:43.15]I would probably say this would be up a little higher.
[402:45.82]But, I mean, that's... That's kind of... In my opinion, that's a huge point of the whole game, I think, right?
[402:52.02]I mean, Emesis is the bad guy.
[402:54.70]They use him too early.
[402:55.46]Yeah, they, like, kind of really... Here he is.
[402:58.30]It's been, like, not even 20 minutes.
[403:04.89]I don't think it's bad.
[403:05.69]I just... I prefer the other style of, like, he could kind of just be anywhere.
[403:10.75]Versus the, like, big extravagant, here's a cutscene, and now fight Nemesis for a few minutes.
[403:16.03]I mean, I still am having a great time.
[403:17.43]7-1 might be unfair.
[403:21.50]We'll find out.
[403:21.92]We'll find out at the end of the game.
[403:24.64]We'll find out.
[403:25.10]We'll be there soon.
[403:26.08]No, I'm not going to give this 64%.
[403:38.59]Alright, let's head down here.
[403:40.17]Alright.
[403:40.69]You ready?
[403:45.50]What about- You need the Magnum for this?
[404:01.52]Oh, 64 saves.
[404:03.04]Alright.
[404:03.76]I have a prediction.
[404:05.93]The amount of saves that the game is when the game is over is my score for the game.
[404:11.80]I think that's fair.
[404:12.42]Explosive A. Gunpowder, gunpowder.
[404:26.14]I want to make some shotgun shells eventually, hopefully.
[404:29.62]I need the magnum.
[404:31.52]Wait, no.
[404:31.98]Just make some pistol rounds.
[404:36.19]Yeah.
[404:36.29]Gonna lose these three.
[404:37.51]Magnum coming out.
[404:41.19]Take it.
[404:42.76]Here's my magnum ammo.
[404:45.54]Take it out.
[404:46.24]Look at all these bullets.
[404:46.88]This is gonna be fucking insane.
[404:48.62]Okay, now... I put away the grenade launcher?
[404:54.90]Maybe I don't need the grenade launcher.
[405:08.62]the handgun away yeah that make actually that makes sense keep yeah keep the grenade launcher keep the magnum I'm gonna lose this we have to make uh okay yeah yeah yeah two heals let's take a third one just in case I'm fucking terrible at the video game here comes the final boss incoming I think it's a 65 so far
[405:43.15]Let's do it.
[405:43.49]This time I'm not going to get hit by you.
[406:02.95]Oh, come on.
[406:06.31]Are you dead?
[406:07.73]Nope.
[406:11.02]Why do you have to fucking have to- I could've just put the stupid- I'm- Turn it on!
[406:37.94]Pursuit- Oh, go!
[406:41.05]Go, go, go.
[406:41.71]Hit the button.
[406:42.15]Hit the button.
[406:49.56]I got my Magnum out.
[406:50.94]Don't fire the Magnum.
[406:51.66]Put the Magnum away.
[406:52.92]It's trucking up.
[406:53.46]I don't know.
[407:30.04]It's time.
[407:31.94]Unfinished activity log.
[407:33.84]Test run at university.
[407:35.40]They gave it a 64%.
[407:36.89]Got eyes on two stars.
[407:41.37]A male infected and a female.
[407:42.75]Bioweapon is pursuing the female.
[407:46.05]Metamorphosis in the bioweapon triggered by a hostile encounter with JV.
[407:49.51]Video attached.
[407:50.89]JV's been infected and has non-responsive.
[407:52.93]Collected samples per orders.
[407:56.43]Vaccine recovered and administered to JV by CO, a soldier in MV platoon.
[408:00.93]JV expected to be fit for combat approximately in 20 hours.
[408:05.72]Seems clear the bioweapon is Project N. Contact with JV causes it to change and evolve.
[408:10.80]Will induce further encounters to obtain.
[408:14.64]JV, Jerm of Venus.
[408:21.02]That faceman you Twitch emo doesn't work.
[408:26.55]That's it.
[408:28.23]Tyrell.
[408:30.99]I got through.
[408:32.15]They're willing to negotiate.
[408:37.14]They'll call off the strike if, and this is one big ass if, we can deliver the vaccine to them.
[408:44.28]Before they launch.
[408:47.02]How long do we have?
[408:48.32]Hours, maybe.
[408:49.52]You said that last time.
[408:51.40]This way.
[408:56.33]Everyone always says hours.
[408:58.47]Hours.
[408:58.81]Hours.
[408:59.31]This was hours ago.
[409:01.03]We'll find the vaccine up ahead.
[409:07.33]Go back.
[409:07.73]What?
[409:14.41]Oh, shit.
[409:14.89]He's going without me.
[409:16.43]Where's the loot?
[409:20.33]Oh, fuck.
[409:20.75]Good thing I turned around.
[409:23.15]I did barrel.
[409:24.33]The magnum?
[409:27.88]Reduces recoil and extra speed increases damage.
[409:30.94]Holy shit, imagine if I didn't get the damage upgrade to the magnum.
[409:36.65]Holy shit, that would have been awful.
[409:38.43]Okay, now I'm gonna, this is gonna be, I'm gonna shoot the guy four times and kill him.
[409:50.67]What if Jerma became a landlord?
[409:54.31]I don't know.
[409:55.39]I'd fucking have fair prices.
[409:56.53]That's what I would have.
[409:57.21]I would have a fair price.
[409:57.97]What are you talking about?
[410:00.77]I mean, true.
[410:09.15]He's gonna turn and I'm gonna shoot him.
[410:14.12]Will you go forward?
[410:16.78]You go first.
[410:17.38]I've played the thing for 12 straight hours, man.
[410:19.58]I know how this works.
[410:20.20]Go.
[410:20.32]I'm not gonna have this happen.
[410:35.83]He's going to bite you.
[410:42.96]There he is.
[410:45.26]Frog.
[410:45.76]Oh.
[411:12.53]Do I control this?
[411:17.25]Alright, so, I'm gonna give you a case in point.
[411:21.27]Why not just have him show up through the hallway?
[411:23.50]And it's like, oh fuck, and he kills the guy.
[411:24.94]You know what I mean?
[411:25.58]Like, in game.
[411:26.22]Don't need a cutscene for everything.
[411:32.25]That was a very fast door.
[411:33.31]Yeah, I would be scared to even walk through this in normal circumstances.
[411:43.64]I need to open this somehow.
[411:52.63]I don't have anything.
[411:59.80]Save.
[412:00.66]Any items in here?
[412:02.98]Shelf?
[412:03.32]Yes.
[412:03.84]Alright, good.
[412:04.44]Now I can make shotgun shells.
[412:05.44]Employee regulations.
[412:10.18]Attention.
[412:10.89]Nest two employees.
[412:13.72]The objective of the T-virus research facility differ from those of the Umbrella's main nest facility.
[412:18.74]Here we focus on real-world use cases which arise as new bioweapons are created and introduced, such as the need for a T-virus vaccine.
[412:26.78]Somebody else will read it.
[412:27.51]Some aspects of our work can be dangerous.
[412:29.41]It's imperative that all employees adhere to workplace regulations without fail.
[412:32.25]Somebody else will read this.
[412:33.55]It's a great honor to be a part of the finest research organizations in the world, and we'll keep in mind we stick to our rules.
[412:41.44]Got the map.
[412:43.04]Got it.
[412:48.99]Any other items in here?
[412:51.18]Computer.
[412:57.82]Green herb.
[412:58.42]Okay.
[413:00.94]Should I just make two green herbs?
[413:03.20]How am I doing on health?
[413:03.84]I'm actually okay.
[413:07.83]Not great, but not bad.
[413:09.69]Not good, but not great.
[413:12.21]We'll carry two with us.
[413:16.69]Reload this thing.
[413:22.88]Free Reddit joke.
[413:26.54]Wait, I made a joke?
[413:28.20]Wait, what did I say?
[413:28.78]I'm not even aware that I did that.
[413:31.34]What did I do?
[413:36.47]I'm not even aware that I'm doing it.
[413:38.71]Landlords in chat with Dan's gaming.
[413:42.53]Landlords in chat.
[413:43.87]Alright, I'm good.
[413:50.23]Boop.
[413:53.50]So, need to find, uh, what?
[413:59.05]This way.
[414:06.75]Alright.
[414:08.13]Workers break room.
[414:08.99]Lab 1.
[414:09.69]Let's go this way first.
[414:11.07]You're gonna get up, aren't you?
[414:14.13]You're not.
[414:15.89]Oh, shit!
[414:17.42]How am I supposed to open...
[414:27.33]Isaac's diary.
[414:30.32]He was generous.
[414:30.90]The benefits were good.
[414:32.64]Somebody else will read this.
[414:34.28]Well, hindsight's 20-20 because this lab has a den of monsters who couldn't... There are barbarians in here.
[414:39.54]It's messed up.
[414:40.08]The world needs to know.
[414:40.82]Umbrella owns this town.
[414:42.43]There was this guy they caught trying to smuggle out company secrets.
[414:45.73]They essentially fed him to one of the betas.
[414:48.61]Fed him.
[414:49.09]I saw the whole thing.
[414:52.09]Fucked up.
[414:56.38]Should've brought the handcuff.
[415:05.21]I tried to dodge too, fuck you.
[415:12.09]This is broken, this is broken, this is broken.
[415:13.67]What the fuck was that?
[415:16.03]That was a big grunt.
[415:30.38]Ooh, more!
[415:31.20]I can make more shotgun shells.
[415:32.48]It's a happy, happy day.
[415:40.11]Handgun ammo.
[415:42.43]Yeah, it's a peepoHappy day.
[415:46.51]Oh shit, we're going late, huh?
[415:49.73]I just looked at the time.
[415:51.45]To begin vaccine synthesis, place the materials in the chamber.
[415:56.07]This shit's been a long time.
[415:58.97]I don't have... I need vaccine materials.
[416:02.73]That's dumb.
[416:06.57]Okay, here we go.
[416:09.37]The most efficiently synthesized... Okay.
[416:11.69]I need an antigen and an adjuvant.
[416:20.53]Sure.
[416:21.09]Go get two items and put it in this box.
[416:23.97]Got it.
[416:31.90]Override key successfully generated.
[416:34.82]What have we here?
[416:35.48]What is that?
[416:37.38]Override key removed.
[416:40.80]Flash drive?
[416:44.31]What did I pick up?
[416:45.29]What?
[416:46.33]Okay.
[416:54.75]Head this way.
[417:00.44]Nothing else on the tables or anything?
[417:01.80]Hmm.
[417:06.20]No, let's go into the lab over here.
[417:08.76]Can I get in?
[417:13.81]Uh... Wait.
[417:18.45]Down the stairs?
[417:20.95]Attention streamer, it's time to stretch.
[417:22.71]Don't worry, I will.
[417:23.17]Let me go back down here.
[417:32.54]But you got, what, flash drive?
[417:34.06]That's right.
[417:36.26]Wait, flash drive.
[417:38.00]Uh, what, what year is it?
[417:41.70]Isn't it like 1997 or something?
[417:48.28]I see him under there.
[417:50.04]I didn't, why did I shoot the shotgun?
[417:52.48]Okay.
[417:53.28]I have to kill these guys with the magnum, you say, right?
[417:55.04]I might, I don't want to waste them.
[417:56.64]There's so many, they're so valuable.
[418:03.13]Make it count!
[418:04.26]His head's moving around too much!
[418:07.50]Got him.
[418:20.30]You fucking asshole!
[418:28.05]Okay.
[418:30.11]They're dead.
[418:33.82]Oh, my health is at zero.
[418:35.46]What a bunch of bullshit.
[418:41.86]Alright, no more of those, alright?
[418:44.80]Keeping notice.
[418:47.29]Hazard materials.
[418:49.85]Take extreme care.
[418:50.67]There's a fucking... There's item one here.
[418:53.89]There's item number one you need here.
[418:57.89]Here, what's that?
[419:14.74]Oh, bye-bye.
[419:16.68]Was it?
[419:16.90]Oh, bye-bye.
[419:25.52]Supposed to be A. That's it, huh?
[419:33.83]Alright.
[419:43.30]A dying message from the scientist.
[419:46.56]The virus is leaked.
[419:49.29]Prepared a culture of the antigen.
[419:52.25]Yes.
[419:54.25]The adjuvant samples are stored in the incubation lab.
[420:02.89]Where the hell is that?
[420:06.91]Up top, maybe?
[420:08.16]Ooh.
[420:11.08]Acid rounds.
[420:18.41]Gunpowder.
[420:19.45]Laptop.
[420:24.54]Wait, I missed.
[420:25.14]What did I miss?
[420:26.36]In the corner?
[420:27.62]Yes.
[420:27.90]I'm running out of space.
[420:32.22]Let me reload this thing.
[420:38.11]Here we go.
[420:39.47]You gotta find the HEV suit.
[420:51.43]Alright, inventory looks like shit.
[420:52.75]I gotta fix this.
[421:01.80]Better?
[421:02.04]Okay, uh, here's the heals.
[421:12.21]Alright, that's fine.
[421:15.17]Oof.
[421:19.53]things tangling they're waiting for you Jeremy in the test chambers where they are this must be what powers it yes this is what oops oh he was the fucking guy that was gonna tell me how to do this I'm
[422:00.11]Oh, it's really easy.
[422:02.97]Yeah, you had a really kind of shitty quest giver job.
[422:06.35]Push, push forward on the device.
[422:11.72]Oh, sorry.
[422:17.48]Uh, first aid.
[422:28.72]Just open.
[422:34.24]Let's go ahead and take out the... this thing, because... I don't feel safe in this one.
[422:55.27]Okay, I gotta ask.
[422:57.46]Why put that in a briefcase this big?
[423:01.30]You could very easily just put that in like a fucking small jar.
[423:06.96]Somebody had to place that right in the middle like a weirdo.
[423:10.22]And close this.
[423:13.72]Why not put like 50 of them in here?
[423:17.14]Why just one?
[423:18.00]I think I'll place one.
[423:27.66]bottle of Tylenol inside of the center of this fucking box.
[423:32.68]We're scientists.
[423:33.34]I don't know.
[423:33.68]For what reason am I doing this?
[423:36.26]There's just like an office weirdo that's in every one of these games.
[423:40.15]That just particularly places fucking shit everywhere in random spots.
[423:44.39]There's no reason for that to be there.
[423:45.53]Why is that there?
[423:47.91]There's no fucking reason why that box isn't on that table.
[423:49.93]The video game.
[423:55.46]Now it's not.
[423:57.47]Shit's real, man.
[423:58.21]It's just me.
[424:01.84]Anything on this table?
[424:12.92]That was a Reddit YouTube bit.
[424:15.57]Okay, uh, YouTube has 700 trillion videos.
[424:18.43]And Reddit has, like, 900,000 of posts a second.
[424:22.39]So, uh, yeah, I guess it could have been on fucking Reddit one day.
[424:27.52]Oh, this is bad.
[424:33.02]Give me a shot to fucking shoot!
[424:38.31]Nooooooo!
[424:42.13]Oh, restart the whole game!
[424:48.89]What the fuck?
[425:23.13]Did I come in this way or am I going this way?
[425:24.67]I don't- I don't- I came in this way.
[425:28.02]Okay, have them all funnel out of the fucking door.
[425:40.12]Have me shoot two explosive fucking grenades at them and nobody dies.
[425:46.90]We call that- we call that ridiculous.
[426:09.83]I thought he was on the ground.
[426:11.11]I thought he was on the ground.
[426:20.83]There he is.
[426:21.41]Mr. fucking guy that leaves the mustard around.
[426:23.95]Sure.
[426:25.39]Uh, hold on.
[426:34.68]Do I want acid rounds?
[426:37.14]Or do I want explosive rounds?
[426:45.75]Or, uh, yeah.
[426:46.39]Do I... Acid.
[426:47.65]Take some acid.
[426:52.77]Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
[426:55.05]I've accidentally made a flame round.
[426:56.96]I'm in.
[426:58.34]Fuck.
[427:14.50]Whatever.
[427:15.06]They all do the same damn thing.
[427:20.03]I... I have to shoot him.
[427:21.59]This is not gonna happen.
[427:24.19]What's in here?
[427:25.83]Alright, sample one.
[427:27.43]Liquid-filled test tube.
[427:38.04]An adjuvant sample.
[427:39.38]These are combined with antigens to increase immune system response.
[428:09.11]I have concerns about this virus that you're making.
[428:11.45]You're making a virus.
[428:14.62]Viruses can be kept in check.
[428:15.86]I believe an effective vaccine can be developed.
[428:18.38]Do you know the name for parasites?
[428:20.22]However, perhaps in your country, consumers are willing to buy them.
[428:25.34]Sincerely, we have a problem.
[428:27.10]We fucked up.
[428:33.97]You've already read it.
[428:36.81]I got it.
[428:37.35]I got to pick that up.
[428:38.05]I have to take it.
[428:38.71]I'm really going to be upset by this, but I'm going to do it.
[428:42.37]I will accept the consequences of my actions if I need to.
[428:45.33]I can't even... I could... Wait, I could have combined them before I put it in the inventory?
[429:07.91]I don't want to make this.
[429:09.17]I don't want flame rounds.
[429:12.73]I got one in the bank.
[429:14.27]I don't want to make another flame round.
[429:21.39]Yes, you do.
[429:21.95]I don't.
[429:22.21]I really don't.
[429:22.65]Fucking gunpowder.
[429:29.19]Just leave it.
[429:29.73]I don't even want it.
[429:32.33]I don't want flame.
[429:32.85]I want the other rounds.
[429:35.68]Okay, I got one.
[429:37.38]Now I gotta go... I'm just gonna put it in the thing.
[429:47.53]Reload.
[429:48.03]Why the fuck would I reload?
[429:49.35]Because I deleted a green herb?
[429:52.11]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[429:58.29]I think I'm gonna be just fine.
[430:03.08]reload your gun oh shoot him
[430:33.26]Okay.
[430:36.57]Fuck was that?
[430:37.15]Okay.
[430:40.57]Reload your gun, not reload the game.
[430:43.75]I thought you guys were telling me to reload the game.
[430:47.61]Like, holy shit, dude.
[430:48.85]Reload.
[430:49.60]Reload the save.
[430:50.60]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[430:52.00]I can't believe it.
[430:52.78]No, you mean reload the gun.
[430:54.18]We were.
[430:59.98]We were.
[431:04.36]Okay, I got five acid rounds.
[431:05.48]I got enough.
[431:09.08]Okay, let's put this back in... Okay, where's that weird device that I can plug this into?
[431:18.47]Up here, right?
[431:22.65]Thank god I killed these guys.
[431:23.85]Imagine if I didn't.
[431:26.09]Alright, where is this?
[431:27.13]Where is it?
[431:29.80]Incubation?
[431:30.54]No, no.
[431:30.88]Where is it?
[431:32.57]Sterilization room?
[431:33.61]Where am I trying to go here?
[431:34.35]Search for an antigen.
[431:39.80]Checked out for how close you'd be in the game.
[431:41.86]Very, very close.
[431:43.62]Very close.
[431:47.88]This is, I believe, the last area from what I remember of playing the original game.
[431:53.41]From what I remember, this is the last area.
[432:00.41]One of, or very close to.
[432:04.01]Got them both.
[432:06.29]Ultra sample.
[432:06.85]Good.
[432:17.90]Weaponry authorization request.
[432:20.60]I'd like to formally request that the weaponry normally reserved for the bioweapon synthesis team be made available to any employee.
[432:28.43]Reasoning some test subjects have developed a new mutation granted them very high regrowth abilities.
[432:33.02]Our team refers to these specimens as pale heads.
[432:36.96]You need to kill them with a big magnum.
[432:40.02]Thanks, chat.
[432:47.20]Okay, now we go down here.
[432:53.48]This is the... We go down this way.
[433:02.41]Permits your mother go to bed.
[433:03.53]No.
[433:07.47]How do I get in here?
[433:14.96]I'll go to bed when I finish the game.
[433:16.76]Which will hopefully be in the next few minutes.
[433:24.01]You're grounded.
[433:24.65]You can't ground me.
[433:26.21]I'm an adult.
[433:30.47]I'm an adult, mom.
[433:31.59]You can't ground me.
[433:41.74]You're an adult.
[433:44.57]Is there another way to get over here?
[433:48.13]I'm not going the right way.
[433:49.65]Just trying to get back to where I put the samples in.
[433:52.35]Back here, right?
[433:58.17]How do I get back there?
[434:00.15]Wrong way.
[434:01.11]Ah, that's what I'm trying to... Just freaked out.
[434:10.75]Uh, can I go this way?
[434:11.55]Ah, it's this way.
[434:12.95]It's this way.
[434:18.70]Now from here we go... I'm just going to save it.
[434:23.11]Because why the hell wouldn't I?
[434:25.35]Got a lot of shit to make.
[434:28.47]Here we go.
[434:28.95]Explosive A. I want explosive rounds.
[434:32.03]That's what I want.
[434:37.76]Thank you.
[434:39.56]I want to do gunpowder.
[434:41.98]And... I don't.
[434:48.13]I don't want to do gunpowder.
[434:51.27]Sample, sample.
[434:52.29]Heal, heal, heal.
[434:53.85]Magnum ammo.
[434:57.20]Scratch.
[434:57.54]I'm alright.
[434:58.02]I'm okay.
[435:02.14]I wonder if I should just bring the... Should I bring the handgun or is it... Are we too far in now?
[435:09.84]Take your Alzheimer's medication.
[435:11.08]I don't want to.
[435:15.63]We're good.
[435:17.38]This is good.
[435:17.94]This is acid rounds, explosive rounds.
[435:20.08]And then I got three flame rounds.
[435:23.91]I got a lot of firepower.
[435:34.43]Load the fuck up.
[435:38.70]Alright, I'll load the fuck up.
[435:39.62]Hold on.
[435:48.38]I loaded the fuck up.
[435:52.01]I'm stacked.
[435:54.79]I got three heals.
[435:56.11]I'm ready.
[435:56.51]Let's move.
[436:02.15]Save it.
[436:14.14]Okay.
[436:15.67]Here we go!
[436:17.38]It's time.
[436:19.40]To go in the same door that I just walked in.
[436:22.86]Um... Because I'm insane.
[436:25.34]Is this the right way?
[436:32.20]No, this is just a fucking, like, mist room.
[436:39.77]Get down.
[436:42.75]I'm going to get lost.
[436:43.63]No, I'm not lost.
[436:45.23]That fucking thing's made out of titanium.
[437:12.45]Be careful.
[437:13.33]There could be one of those monsters.
[437:16.45]Alright, here we go.
[437:18.79]I'm loaded up.
[437:20.31]I am to the brim.
[437:24.22]Put it in.
[437:24.54]Okay.
[437:26.38]Put in the liquid-filled test tube.
[437:30.80]And put in the sample.
[437:31.50]Culture sample.
[437:43.15]Do I have to shake him?
[438:27.74]What's this?
[438:30.76]Oh, that's too much red over there.
[438:32.36]Turn it down.
[438:46.79]Got it.
[438:51.31]I'll take it.
[438:51.65]Yes!
[438:58.37]That was scientific.
[438:59.19]Fuck.
[438:59.35]Here we go.
[439:00.75]I thought you were stabbing yourself in the face.
[439:27.44]You guys have a glow stick?
[439:28.40]Okay.
[439:34.79]Escape the facility.
[439:37.95]I need to heal?
[439:39.25]Not yet.
[439:40.73]Oh, look.
[439:40.97]A little mouse hole.
[439:41.67]I can go in here.
[439:42.15]Okay.
[439:56.80]Around the neck again, really?
[439:59.56]Really?
[440:08.88]And again, he's just... We got a cutscene showing him looking to grab you.
[440:17.39]Tap W?
[440:33.74]Uh, do I press another button?
[440:36.73]What is he doing right now?
[440:43.99]Just letting that happen?
[440:47.07]Oh, you're pulling me.
[440:48.23]Stop.
[440:49.40]Stop it.
[440:51.34]Oh.
[440:53.38]Oh, shit.
[440:58.17]You have another arm, Nemesis, don't you?
[441:06.09]Perfect.
[441:10.70]That's enough to make.
[441:11.92]Um... Shotgun shells.
[441:13.98]I have gunpowder, right?
[441:17.86]Do I not have gunpowder?
[441:18.66]Fuck.
[441:20.38]I don't have any more gunpowder.
[441:21.28]Annoying.
[441:24.82]That's really annoying.
[441:29.22]When did I use it?
[441:39.83]Let me... Maybe take another heal?
[441:47.39]Just to fill up on heals?
[441:51.96]Or just take the other first?
[441:52.68]I'm going to take the first.
[441:53.38]Yeah, let's go.
[441:53.96]I'm taking all these cans of whipped cream.
[441:56.36]We're going.
[441:56.62]I'm ready.
[441:58.22]I'm ready.
[442:02.08]Save it.
[442:07.14]Oh, fuck.
[442:07.82]There's another one.
[442:08.60]What else you got here?
[442:09.82]Oh, fuck.
[442:10.54]I can make more.
[442:11.21]Wait.
[442:11.43]Stay here.
[442:12.29]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[442:17.53]Store this for a second.
[442:18.25]I'm going to make the other magnum gun.
[442:23.15]Let's see.
[442:27.98]Magnum.
[442:29.44]Combine.
[442:29.70]Combine.
[442:31.79]Now I got 14.
[442:33.61]Perfect.
[442:36.41]I'm going to spray myself in the face with this.
[442:41.25]Pick up the other one.
[442:42.19]I got free heal.
[442:43.49]Okay.
[442:48.05]First aid.
[442:48.99]First aid.
[442:50.19]Forget about the rest of this shit.
[442:53.20]This is it.
[442:53.56]I'm ready.
[442:57.22]Let's fucking do it.
[443:03.84]Face and eye torture.
[443:04.94]Alright, what do we got first?
[443:08.66]Flame rounds.
[443:09.16]Sound good to me.
[443:09.66]Let's do it.
[443:10.30]I'm ready.
[443:12.57]What's this?
[443:14.81]Disposal center.
[443:19.29]Potent solvents used will ensure that any biological matter within the vat, living or dead, is completely dissolved.
[443:23.92]Alright, I gotta dissolve the guy in acid.
[443:30.72]Okay.
[443:30.86]Okay.
[443:38.99]Drew, what is this place?
[443:56.32]Hello, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[443:58.87]Not quite.
[444:05.53]Alright, let's do it.
[444:24.45]Don't lose that vial.
[444:25.49]Oh, I'm not supposed to be on here.
[444:27.75]What do we have here?
[444:30.41]Nikolai, don't!
[444:31.81]The city needs that vaccine!
[444:34.75]More than I do.
[444:39.66]I don't think the wisdom I've been trying to impart on you is getting through.
[444:46.40]Now, I know you can't put a price on life.
[444:51.38]But I'm in this business to get paid.
[444:55.15]So, let's make a deal.
[444:57.30]You go down there, battle the nemesis, and I'll recall it all and sell the combat dock.
[445:03.72]Put on a good show, and maybe I don't need the vaccine.
[445:08.87]Agreed?
[445:09.73]Alright, kill the nemesis.
[445:10.55]Good!
[445:11.93]I think I can do that.
[445:17.79]I have enough weapons.
[445:18.58]I'm not supposed to be on it.
[445:20.94]Now I am.
[445:22.99]Go.
[445:23.67]Alright.
[445:24.49]Dump of acid on him.
[445:32.81]I don't even- I have too much stuff.
[445:36.94]Alright, I gotta dump acid on him.
[445:38.52]Gotta get him underneath one of these things and dump acid on him.
[445:43.46]I shoot them?
[445:49.16]Yeah, alright.
[445:49.56]I can shoot- I can shoot these.
[445:52.74]And then acid dumped on his head.
[445:54.90]Fuck, it's fucking draining.
[445:56.22]It's burning his head.
[445:57.18]You hear him screaming?
[446:15.16]You're doing a good job.
[446:16.38]Thanks.
[446:34.35]Okay, so what the hell am I supposed to do about this shit?
[446:37.19]Oh, one.
[446:43.31]Did I have that right?
[446:45.19]Do I have to just fucking break these all?
[446:49.80]Oh, no, that, that, that, that, that, that zaps.
[446:51.64]Alright, I get it.
[446:52.20]I have to get him underneath one of these.
[446:57.62]Jumped over it.
[446:58.30]How the fuck is that even possible?
[447:02.91]Okay, ready?
[447:03.29]Here he comes.
[447:12.75]Can I go in one of these vents?
[447:43.38]Can I remove save files?
[447:45.06]I'm gonna remove save files.
[447:46.98]I wanna remove them.
[448:11.68]What?
[448:12.02]What is he doing?
[448:12.91]Why are you doing this again?
[448:14.45]Alright, shock him!
[448:24.00]Acid!
[448:26.56]Acid hurt his tendril!
[448:28.86]What?
[448:45.38]that again what I've got the oh I've got I've got why are there ads
[449:21.46]Go do the thing again.
[449:28.07]Go!
[449:28.59]Chuck him!
[449:51.02]Alright, dump him in the acid, and then... Do I have any more?
[450:04.17]Oh shit, I don't.
[450:30.15]But he didn't choose a thing!
[450:31.23]He didn't choose!
[450:33.31]Why didn't he choose?
[450:55.66]Imagine adding ads to this fight.
[450:58.95]Imagine adding ads to this fight.
[451:03.57]Imagine.
[451:06.01]Dude, wait.
[451:24.16]What the...
[451:25.66]I can't even... Why are there random zombie adds?
[451:33.64]Use it to climb up.
[451:55.84]Alright, kill him!
[452:06.26]He's not dead.
[452:06.80]He's gonna get up.
[452:07.45]He's gonna jump up and he's gonna grab us.
[452:13.31]Yeah, but he's gonna be in there for 12 hours.
[452:28.92]How do you propose to keep him in there for 12 hours?
[452:31.54]Never mind, I'm here.
[452:36.15]Okay, I only have...
[452:54.61]Oh, I got plenty of shots.
[452:55.51]Do I have enough health to do this?
[453:01.37]I hope so.
[453:10.66]First aid spray.
[453:12.50]Weapon spec sheet.
[453:17.01]Next generation railgun.
[453:19.55]Code name, Finger.
[453:21.87]Ammo.
[453:22.35]Velocity.
[453:22.89]Impression of new bioweapons in case of outbreak.
[453:26.23]Extreme firepower provides the secondary benefit of completely obliterating the target, leaving no trace behind.
[453:31.51]The thing is... Thank you, Fez, for the five community subs.
[453:35.96]Appreciate the five subs.
[453:37.60]Thank you.
[453:39.22]The thing is totally rad.
[453:41.46]Tyrants out alive, just give them the finger and problem solved.
[453:44.66]Apex firepower where it needed...
[453:48.05]Would be even better if there was a way to control the output.
[453:49.97]Mobility may prove to be problematic.
[453:52.55]Multiple power sources.
[453:57.91]I need power sources to use the ultra gun.
[454:01.82]Okay.
[454:04.06]What's left in here?
[454:04.86]Let's take the green herb out.
[454:07.48]I'll sniff it and maybe get like a... Maybe it'll help me.
[454:12.94]Eventually... Just take this gun out too.
[454:16.37]Right?
[454:17.17]Why not?
[454:20.73]No, there's probably more shit there.
[454:22.57]There's probably way more stuff to take.
[454:25.21]Donor gamer.
[454:29.95]Why are my eyes red?
[454:30.67]Because the white balance is wrong on this camera.
[454:34.23]Alright, let's go.
[454:34.67]Wait.

[454:52.18]You're not going into daddy's office.
[454:54.38]That's fucking funny.
[455:08.25]Okay, I don't have any.
[455:09.85]Just store it.
[455:10.59]I don't even need any bullets.
[455:11.84]I'm going to use the super gun.
[455:12.84]I don't need to save the game again.

[456:18.27]The data on this would be worth millions.
[456:21.32]But... You know how it is.
[456:25.96]City's about to explode.
[456:28.16]And you can't put a price on life.
[456:31.42]Good luck!
[456:32.72]Nikolai!
[456:34.52]Jill!
[456:36.14]Go after Nikolai.
[456:37.06]He's got the vaccine.
[456:37.70]Wait, I thought he... No, he died in my dream.
[456:39.60]What about you?
[456:40.82]We're running out of time.
[456:42.44]I've got this.
[456:44.08]I know you do.
[456:46.93]Ah!
[456:47.97]Power source, activate.

[458:42.67]Wait, go pick up all this shit so I don't like spam like I'm playing Diablo fucking 2.
[458:47.09]Please.
[458:50.29]Get it all.
[458:51.15]There's more on this side too.
[458:52.25]Pick it all up.
[458:52.77]Watch out for the fucking big claw.
[458:59.07]There's shit everywhere.
[459:01.53]I don't even know what this is.
[459:03.61]Alright, do I have any bullets?
[459:08.70]Okay, I'm ready.
[459:11.00]Make a different reference, Blizzard fanboy.
[459:14.60]Cha-ah!
[459:15.92]I scare him.
[459:17.08]Give me the egg sacs.
[459:59.82]What's that tree's name from Dark Souls 3?
[460:01.22]One.
[460:01.34]I shoot him?
[460:49.45]Oh, there's another hand.
[461:29.69]Alright, get it.
[461:30.31]Just get it.
[461:30.77]Right in the heart.
[462:01.75]Oh, that went all the way down.
[462:08.27]Good riddance.
[462:29.49]Take back the vaccine.
[462:31.07]Well, first of all... Uh... I'm gonna have to do a little bit of a just look around, make sure... Okay, everything has been collected.
[462:39.75]How do I look in here?
[462:40.41]I'm gonna take one of these heals.
[462:43.27]Could've just eaten the fucking green herb.
[462:44.57]Didn't take less than five seconds before... You know, you take a second before you click on fucking things.
[462:51.30]Alright.
[462:53.24]Plenty of ammo.
[462:54.42]And...
[462:55.69]Okay.
[462:56.35]Reload everything.
[462:57.01]I don't have any more... Sucks.
[463:03.85]I'm in big trouble.
[463:18.27]Who's backing a truck up?
[463:32.06]Alright.
[463:36.22]Is he about to fly away in a space shuttle?
[463:37.86]I don't understand.
[463:43.89]Always go around the back and look.
[463:44.91]Remember.
[464:02.08]That's not padding.
[464:02.82]There might be like a box of ammo right there.
[464:07.32]There's not much left for me to pad.
[464:14.27]A final save point?
[464:17.83]Oh.
[464:18.75]No info.
[464:20.41]I don't even get a final save point?
[464:22.09]Oh no.
[464:35.42]You're not going to stop.
[464:36.44]I promised you this, didn't I?
[464:42.88]No!
[464:44.28]Wait, lick it up.
[464:44.76]Do you have any idea what you've just done?
[464:46.40]Oh, no.
[464:48.20]Lick it up.
[464:48.70]Suck it up and hold it in your mouth and don't spit it out.
[464:50.24]Ten minutes until missile impact.
[464:53.88]That's what I'd be doing right now.
[464:54.74]I'd be going... And I would just keep it in my mouth and I wouldn't swallow it.
[464:59.62]Goodbye, Miss Valentine.
[465:03.25]Shame you didn't listen to me when you had the chance.
[465:10.98]Oh no, you broke my CVD picture.
[465:15.90]That's fucking funny.
[465:17.50]Ow.
[465:41.02]I mean, what, you don't think I can aim?
[465:49.44]Yeah, like, why not just walk forward?
[465:53.02]Hey, just, can you drag him, like, come, just put the gun up to his forehead.
[465:56.98]I'll hold him.
[465:58.87]Why would you need to shoot from that far away?
[466:02.69]Why'd you do it?
[466:09.12]There's a price tag for everything.
[466:12.59]Even letting the world burn.
[466:15.79]Who are you working for?
[466:19.25]I'll tell you if you get me out of here.
[466:23.09]I'll pay you whatever you want.
[466:27.74]You're a fool.
[466:30.16]You're a fool!
[466:32.34]If I die, you'll never find out the truth.
[466:38.20]I don't mind a little detective work.
[466:47.22]Wait, didn't I shoot him in the head?
[466:49.11]Didn't I just shoot him with a gun?
[466:51.89]I shot him like in the fucking head.
[466:54.67]Why is he talking?
[466:55.31]Chill.
[467:08.28]Did I win?
[467:14.72]Good thing we're in a plane because it missed us.
[467:24.72]No way.
[467:25.92]No way.
[467:26.60]Is that how it ends?
[467:30.16]Oh, I thought it was the helicopter got hit with the missile.
[467:42.37]It did happen technically it technically happened we got hit by the blast technically Wait the city got destroyed finally over How is that a good ending So long RC
[468:09.27]I felt empty and cold as the heat from the blast washed over us.
[468:15.31]All this death wasn't caused by a monster making virus.
[468:18.73]It was greed.
[468:25.28]Human greed.
[468:29.82]It was made by man.
[468:31.68]The ashes of Raccoon City would be Umbrella's ashes too.
[468:35.62]I would end them.
[468:37.18]Once and for all.
[468:40.29]It was man.
[468:41.35]Oh, that is the end.
[468:46.65]Biggest villain of them all.
[468:49.41]Mankind.
[468:52.62]As monsters.
[468:56.02]Us.
[468:56.12]Is there an after the credits thing?
[469:01.80]It was greed.
[469:02.40]No, no, no, no.
[469:02.96]It was greed.
[469:03.42]It was greed.
[469:03.86]It was greed, actually.
[469:05.26]Oh, sorry.
[469:10.09]What did the game get?
[469:12.14]How many saves was it?
[469:12.90]74?
[469:12.96]It is.
[469:14.66]It's 74.
[469:19.34]That's perfect, I think.
[469:20.36]Remember I told you I thought it might be a little low at 71?
[469:21.82]Perfect.
[469:22.12]74.
[469:22.18]Much acid.
[469:42.44]Go to sleep.
[469:43.88]I will, I will.
[469:47.98]It was still a quality experience, but wasn't even close to the second one.
[469:52.14]And I know that it's completely different games, but they are made in the same vein.
[469:56.70]They've released within a couple of years of each other, and one's a direct sequel to the other one.
[470:02.38]And they're both remakes.
[470:07.64]I think Nemesis was done very poorly, I'll just be honest.
[470:11.67]I think every time Nemesis shows up, you don't have to give me a cutscene.
[470:14.29]I think it's more fun if he just kind of scares you.
[470:18.26]Even near the end, there was a lot of cases where Nemesis just kind of could have just broken a wall down as the big guy.
[470:24.92]Or, I don't know, it was a cutscene for everything.
[470:27.94]That's really the only complaint I have.
[470:29.30]That's it.
[470:31.08]And that's enough to bring it down a lot for me.
[470:35.24]The game was fun.
[470:35.92]The actual video game was still just as good and just as fun and just as interesting as the last one.
[470:41.86]But I think there's just a little too much on the kind of showing your hand before you put it down.
[470:48.24]What about the writing?
[470:53.80]Yeah, but they're all kind of like that, though.
[470:55.10]They're all cheesy.
[471:02.48]I'm still happy I played it.
[471:03.30]I still think it was worth playing, absolutely.
[471:06.42]But I don't know if I would put this in the category of wow.
[471:11.98]I put this in the category of, yeah, that was worth it.
[471:22.02]It's no Animal Crossing.
[471:27.29]No, it's not.
[471:31.99]It's no Animal Crossing.
[471:33.59]Now you're going to do the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
[471:42.86]I'm not sure about that.
[471:43.78]What would I say is a fair price for the game?
[471:50.75]That's hard to give you an answer for that because this did feel like sort of an extended campaign from the second game.
[472:07.37]Like, if you said this was Resident Evil 2, a full, like, actual five-plus-hour DLC campaign, and it's like, it's just the third game.
[472:18.11]And it was, oh, hey, by the way, Resident Evil 3 DLC!
[472:20.85]It's kind of, I guess it felt like it a little bit.
[472:24.69]I don't, I don't, I think $20, I think $30 would be, no, that's too, that's too cheap.
[472:28.35]$29?
[472:30.21]$99?
[472:30.25]No, no, no, no, I don't know about that.
[472:44.58]It's just $60.
[472:45.78]Some games are four hours.
[472:47.75]Some games you can beat it.
[472:48.95]You can go back and play over and over again.
[472:50.53]You can't really... I mean, it's a AAA game that releases.
[472:54.37]They're all going to be $60.
[472:55.05]$20 or less. $20.
[473:10.29]It's a remake, though.
[473:12.09]Yeah, but it's not like it's a code of paint.
[473:16.81]It's a full, completely done video game.
[473:21.29]It's not like they just put it in HD textures.
[473:24.95]It's a complete remake of the entire game.
[473:33.41]Did I play the Resident Evil 1 remake?
[473:34.75]I did not.
[473:36.39]Yeah, it's from the ground up.
[473:41.15]um no I mean I think I think it was worth playing but it's hard to stand them both next to each other when this one is number three and the last one is number two and number two was way more fun that's why it's hard to kind of score this because I just experienced like a year and a half ago two years ago
[474:01.43]like the one before this and this is the one directly after it so it's kind of hard not to be like oh well this you would figure maybe the three they'd learn some stuff from two and everybody loved it maybe they'll make three just a better two it'll be just better but it feels like a step backwards instead of a step forward that's why it's 74. only been a year yeah
[474:30.35]Is there a post-credits to find out?
[474:33.57]We gotta go.
[474:36.85]I've completely ruined every rule I've ever made.
[474:40.37]The bits, I'll do the bits tomorrow.
[474:57.49]Tomorrow's stream is not going to be very long.
[474:59.07]I'll be honest with you.
[475:00.83]We're going to play Tiny Toons for a little while, maybe something else.
[475:07.05]But we will do both bits tomorrow.
[475:14.99]How long did it take me to break the rule?
[475:16.36]I broke it like a week ago as well.
[475:20.62]But me needing to get up and stretch like an hour and a half ago or so, like I have to get up.
[475:26.12]Starting to lock up.
[475:31.31]Is there actually a thing at the end?
[475:44.35]Dude, you're breaking the rules.
[475:46.67]Well, this might not be... No, I said... Eh, it's an eight-hour stream.
[475:49.86]It's alright.
[475:57.78]Say no more heroes.
[476:01.47]But tomorrow, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[476:02.77]We're going to do Tiny Toons Wacky Sports Adventure for the Super Nintendo.
[476:07.37]One of my favorite games for Super Nintendo.
[476:08.85]It should be fun.
[476:10.43]And depending if I get my fill of that, we might move on to something else.
[476:12.76]We might move on to some other Super Nintendo game, maybe.
[476:35.01]There you go.
[476:35.73]C. Yeah, game.
[476:41.50]Exactly what I fucking gave you for a score.
[476:44.72]It's perfect.
[476:48.24]Six and a half hours of clearing time.
[476:53.34]Like, oh, you gave me a C?
[476:54.60]Well, fuck you, streamer.
[476:56.17]You're a C. I deserve it.
[476:58.61]Fine.
[477:03.15]Six and a half hours.
[477:05.54]Oh.
[477:09.82]Completed challenges.
[477:12.76]The shop has been unlocked.
[477:16.37]Shop?
[477:22.49]What do I have?
[477:24.19]A recovery coin?
[477:28.79]Really increases your defense when held.
[477:31.11]Carry two.
[477:31.63]Increases your attack power when held.
[477:36.70]Just start with bolt cutters.
[477:40.75]Start with the lockpick.
[477:43.71]Get the outfit.
[477:44.25]Get the outfit.
[477:44.77]Get the outfit.
[477:45.31]Get the outfit.
[477:45.89]Costume.
[477:46.37]Costume.
[477:46.87]Weapon.
[477:47.31]Hot dog.
[477:49.43]Whoa.
[477:49.87]I can afford this.
[477:59.89]Ooh.
[478:02.53]Get the hot dog or get the outfit?
[478:04.95]Hot dog.
[478:08.27]I want to see what it does.
[478:13.70]New game, right?
[478:39.90]Okay.
[478:47.18]A hot dog!
[478:55.67]What?
[478:56.31]Okay, equip.
[479:04.02]I want to put it on slot four.
[479:17.08]I have to kill somebody with this.
[479:19.90]Wait.
[479:38.09]There it is.
[479:40.64]Okay, give me four.
[479:43.44]I just beat the whole game to be able to put this thing on.
[479:46.19]I have to kill something.
[479:47.77]Go to bed.
[479:55.92]Go to bed.
[479:56.28]Just wait.
[479:56.72]I just want to kill one enemy with this new sword.
[480:01.45]I'm never gonna open this game again.
[480:03.13]Don't you understand?
[480:03.72]I'm not gonna open the game again.
[480:05.24]This is the last time I'm ever gonna see this character.
[480:08.89]I'm not opening this for a second time.
[480:31.25]I'm looking for an enemy in a zombie game, and I can't find him.
[480:48.26]We have school tomorrow.
[480:49.06]Hold on, Mom.
[480:49.48]Why don't you stand up?
[480:58.18]Nice.
[481:01.39]Cool, this is cool.
[481:03.65]You!
[481:13.17]Well, this is a cheat.
[481:17.56]That's it.
[481:18.12]Broken.
[481:19.12]This makes the whole game hard to lose.
[481:30.87]No, it doesn't.
[481:31.31]Never mind.
[481:32.59]I thought it was a one-hit kill.
[481:33.51]I thought it was a one-hit kill.
[481:35.17]It's not a one-hit kill.
[481:36.31]It just looks cool.
[481:38.05]How many sticks?
[481:39.62]Three.
[481:40.60]Four.
[481:41.38]Five.
[481:41.98]Six.
[481:42.82]Seven.
[481:44.08]I wish I bought the costume.
[481:48.76]Eight.
[481:49.30]Nine.
[481:50.85]Takes like ten swings to kill a regular zombie.
[481:55.65]Okay, bye.
[481:56.01]See you tomorrow.
[482:01.14]Take care of yourselves.
[482:02.38]I'm just gonna go.
[482:03.80]We will do the bits tomorrow at the end of the stream.
[482:05.58]We'll do them both.
[482:06.16]Don't worry.
[482:07.42]Please remind me to do that.
[482:11.05]I am going to go get loose.
[482:16.43]See you guys tomorrow.
[482:18.01]That was Resident Evil 3 Remake.
[482:19.39]Glad I played it.
[482:20.51]Now I can say, alright, I did it.
[482:22.39]It was fun.
[482:24.51]Tonight, take care of yourselves.
[482:25.81]Get some sleep.
[482:26.37]I know we went late.
[482:27.23]We're not supposed to be doing that anymore.
[482:28.52]But I did.
[482:31.61]I wasn't going to play this tomorrow.
[482:33.28]I didn't want to stream this for like an hour tomorrow.
[482:35.22]I'm just not going to do that.
[482:36.08]Have a great night.
[482:39.30]See you tomorrow?
[483:01.34]Thank you.
