[01:28.94]Yeah, everybody.
[01:31.98]Welcome to another live stream.
[01:35.04]Live, courtesy of my house.
[01:36.57]Sounds like somebody's gonna get some Mondays, by the way.
[01:42.79]I'm just like Garfield.
[01:46.69]Oh, just give me some lasagna, and maybe Odie can... Fuck it.
[01:52.86]Never mind.
[01:53.76]That's because there's something else.
[01:56.30]But, we'll see you in a minute.
[01:59.31]Give me like five minutes, guys.
[02:00.90]What the fuck?
[02:01.56]Bye.
[02:01.80]I'll be right back.
[03:01.45]Alright.
[03:02.47]Let's get this turned off.
[03:04.31]Let's move this over here.
[03:06.85]And... Hey.
[03:08.29]Look at that.
[03:08.69]Look at how beautiful this is.
[03:13.35]Philomery streams on Twitch.
[03:15.08]It's really him.
[03:19.94]Garfield's such a weird character.
[03:24.18]Garfield's one of those characters that really shouldn't be doing well.
[03:28.02]But is.
[03:28.16]But is.
[03:31.36]Open up any Garfield comic book.
[03:36.39]Right?
[03:37.65]Scan through the pages.
[03:38.49]You can go get a compilation if you want.
[03:41.09]This is how a Garfield comic usually goes.
[03:44.55]Garfield in panel one.
[03:47.00]Lying in his... In a bed.
[03:50.48]Look at it.
[03:50.84]He's lying in bed.
[03:52.30]He's got the covers on him.
[03:54.10]And he's sitting there.
[03:55.28]He's just snoring the disease on his head.
[03:58.04]John walks by.
[03:59.24]Second panel now.
[04:01.82]Looks really, really concerned.
[04:03.94]Really irritated at that fucking cat over there.
[04:07.24]Panel number three.
[04:09.13]Taps Garfield on the shoulder.
[04:12.55]Garfield just won't wake up.
[04:14.05]He just won't do it.
[04:15.53]Panel number five.
[04:17.33]Finally, Garfield, one eye opens.
[04:19.83]One eye is open.
[04:20.81]And a little fly is flying away from his eye.
[04:22.98]He's really asleep.
[04:25.46]Panel number six is John saying, My goodness, Garfield.
[04:32.30]How did you get in the cat box?
[04:35.08]That's it.
[04:38.36]Garfield was sleeping in his cat box.
[04:41.29]That's every single Garfield comic strip you're ever going to read.
[04:58.06]Oh, by the way, I need audio.
[05:03.27]That's every Garfield strip.
[05:05.13]He falls asleep in places he's not supposed to and eats human food.
[05:11.17]There you go, Garfield!
[05:12.13]Whoa!
[05:13.53]Garfield, I told you not to sleep in your cat box!
[05:18.98]That's all of those jokes.
[05:26.11]We're gonna go to R. We're very far away.
[05:32.83]Can I fast travel to Agave?
[05:36.75]One of these, I'm gonna.
[05:37.47]This is way too far away.
[05:43.56]You sound a little different.
[05:44.52]I actually, I actually took a nap.
[05:47.00]I took a nap earlier and just woke up not that long ago.
[05:52.52]Hop off my horsey here.
[05:53.82]Oh, it's money.
[06:01.12]What are you talking about?
[06:11.60]Alright, I can do that.
[06:15.57]It's a ZZZ streamer, yeah.
[06:21.21]Uh, but yeah.
[06:21.75]I don't know, what was my point with the whole Garfield thing?
[06:30.53]I don't remember.
[06:31.03]Does anybody know what that, what that, what was that for?
[06:39.45]How did you get in the litter box?
[06:43.37]One of my eyes has to open, like, and a little fly comes out.
[06:53.46]You're as funny as Garfield.
[06:55.02]Oh, okay, that's an insult.
[06:57.78]Excuse me.
[07:00.72]Excuse me.
[07:05.37]Oh, shit, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[07:08.11]I thought we already did this.
[07:17.84]I thought we already did this.
[07:20.69]It's alright.
[07:23.31]We said it two times.
[07:27.69]We're good.
[07:28.39]What would your most loyal follower, Luisa, say about that?
[07:31.92]Who?
[07:32.76]Luisa, the girl from Campo Morada.
[07:36.12]Alright.
[07:36.92]A gentleman never tells, but she was a most wonderful.
[07:40.10]Fully clothed sex scene.
[07:41.98]I just say she.
[07:45.44]With my lasagna.
[07:46.60]I'm not Garfield.
[07:47.48]Not fucking Garfield.
[07:48.14]Thank you, Party Crabs for the bits.
[07:49.62]You can fast travel anywhere with a waypoint.
[07:53.98]Yeah, I forgot.
[07:54.77]It just took me a second to figure it out.
[08:13.97]This used to be a PG stream, I know it did.
[08:36.78]But come on, let's run.
[08:38.36]I've got an amazing present for you, my brother.
[08:41.14]I guess the man you seek.
[08:43.50]Together, we will bring them to justice.
[08:46.20]I'm not Garfield.
[08:47.10]I'm his loser owner son.
[08:48.76]And what about, speaking of his loser owner son, he was, wasn't he?
[08:54.15]He was like a loser, wasn't he?
[08:57.19]Wasn't it always John's story arc?
[08:59.98]Women don't like me.
[09:01.16]I have no life.
[09:02.60]Wasn't it always stuff like that?
[09:03.96]Didn't he like hate his job and like hate his life and shit?
[09:06.42]That's like fucking depressing.
[09:09.56]John didn't have a story arc besides I'm socially awkward around women and I hate my life.
[09:16.91]Wow, that's like fucking sad as all hell.
[09:20.51]Did John ever get like laid in the story?
[09:24.41]After, like, 37 years of Garfield, did John, like, ever, like, bang the waitress?
[09:29.53]Who was that lady?
[09:31.81]Wasn't there, like, a waitress lady that he was in love with?
[09:34.17]He didn't have a girlfriend.
[09:35.39]What story?
[09:36.43]Not particularly.
[09:37.11]He was hardly worth a bullet.
[09:58.90]Please don't make this a Garfield stream.
[10:01.80]Oh, that's gonna... You better believe, dude, that that's gonna come up.
[10:08.16]You better believe that that's gonna come up, like, at least seven or eight more times this stream.
[10:11.51]I always liked Odie, though.
[10:12.85]Odie was always a cool character, I thought.
[10:15.71]I really, really... Really connected with Odie as a character.
[10:35.01]Accompany him to L. Okay, so I would be said to do this No, this is a dive bomb mission But he's lit the fuse
[11:13.82]Why is he staying so close right now?
[11:19.10]Wouldn't he, like, leave?
[11:21.50]You'd think you would want to get out of here.
[11:24.04]Alright, I had to give myself a little bit of a challenge, guys.
[11:28.65]Hold on.
[11:44.45]Yeah, good challenge.
[11:48.53]Shoot the fuse.
[11:51.09]Nice challenge.
[11:51.93]It was a little too much of a challenge.
[11:54.15]It was like a saw challenge from like Saw 3.
[11:57.85]You know those were impossible.
[11:59.29]You couldn't beat those.
[12:02.23]How long do I have to... Did I die?
[12:09.35]Okay, I'm okay.
[12:14.69]That was the most awkward thing I've ever seen.
[12:18.56]He had like the butt head.
[12:19.86]Okay, that was fucking stupid.
[12:25.54]Look at how many freaks and geeks are in here.
[12:28.26]There's like three freaks and geeks.
[12:29.63]Are you serious?
[12:33.77]No, I'm just going up there.
[12:34.71]What do we got?
[12:39.93]Just a couple of sandbags.
[12:45.88]Where are they?
[12:46.40]Are they all up top?
[12:52.47]One guy there.
[12:53.11]He's all the way up.
[12:57.41]Grand Theft Auto.
[13:17.23]Let's search this one.
[13:19.71]Search up in the bell tower.
[13:24.27]Anybody?
[13:24.71]I don't see any Luisa.
[13:33.59]All the way up, huh?
[13:35.04]I gotta go all the way up.
[13:39.06]There's a machine gun up here.
[13:41.84]I will take the sniper rifle out now.
[13:44.32]Watch this one, ready?
[13:46.45]Bet you didn't think I was fucking good enough to do a quickscope like this.
[13:50.23]Hold on.
[13:54.03]Ooh, quickscope right in the groinal area.
[14:03.57]Really?
[14:05.55]Really?
[14:10.94]I'm just gonna get on the machine gun.
[14:12.42]Fuck this.
[14:17.06]Oh.
[14:18.18]I can't move the Gatling gun more than, like, fucking 10 feet.
[14:20.66]That's fine.
[14:26.48]Oh, shit.
[14:30.18]Okay, alive still?
[14:41.70]What are you people doing?
[14:45.20]That guy just broke his back.
[14:46.80]Oh my god, this is great.
[14:52.27]I love how we got people just standing still.
[15:00.53]Is this like a spawn point for them?
[15:03.96]No, don't climb up the fucking ladder, stupid.
[15:12.05]They act very strangely when they spawn.
[15:20.95]I just want to talk.
[15:22.73]Maybe upstairs.
[15:25.08]Up the stairs.
[15:27.92]There he is.
[15:28.26]Hello, old friend.
[15:32.32]It's been a long time.
[15:34.82]It's good to see you.
[15:37.05]I heard you was coming.
[15:38.05]You took your time, no?
[15:40.49]Come on, you're not going to shoot your own brother.
[15:42.09]This is a Baptist dream.
[15:44.04]Yeah, we were.
[15:45.86]And you and Dutch went crazy and family didn't mean so much.
[15:50.02]So now you do the government's work.
[15:53.02]And what do you do?
[15:54.26]You just work for a different government.
[15:58.11]So this is my brother?
[15:59.51]I think we should go our separate ways, huh?
[16:03.85]What you and Dutch did was wrong.
[16:06.11]And the way you left me was wrong.
[16:09.49]I hate to judge, but as it turns out, it's you or me.
[16:15.33]The way I see it, might as well be you.
[16:18.43]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:19.90]I promise.
[16:22.68]Thank you, Party Crabs, for the three bucks.
[16:25.14]Besides, I can give you... Stop eating lasagna, you lazy motherfucker.
[16:30.96]He didn't say that.
[16:31.90]I added that.
[16:33.24]You left me to die?
[16:35.96]No, he pushed over a box next to me!
[16:48.39]My fucking weakness!
[16:53.46]I've killed so many people.
[16:55.82]I've seen so many horrible things, but that box might have had some fucking liquid in it.
[16:59.28]I didn't want to get any liquid on my shirt.
[17:10.22]Maybe he's getting away.
[17:15.82]What?
[17:20.30]Oh, is he now?
[17:21.62]Oh, is he getting away?
[17:23.00]I don't know where he is.
[17:26.55]Where is he?
[17:38.01]Okay, that guy, uh...
[17:43.76]Can I just climb up there?
[17:44.76]I guess so.
[17:49.30]Okay.
[17:55.04]Where the fuck is he?
[17:58.56]What?
[17:58.66]Do I just have to snipe him?
[18:10.07]Got him.
[18:14.32]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[18:15.52]Easy, John!
[18:16.68]Easy, John!
[18:17.50]That gave me, like, a fucking bad headache.
[18:21.97]Wait, I just shot him with a fucking sniper rifle.
[18:30.33]Alright, let's hog-die him.
[18:38.32]It's over, old friend!
[18:39.86]I got you now!
[18:43.11]Train him.
[18:43.45]Train him.
[18:44.09]Throw this motherfucker on the train.
[18:47.17]Sub Jupiter.
[19:13.93]Why is he already freaking out over sub-Jupiter?
[19:16.31]So, if you... This is just an honor thing, right?
[19:18.63]If I don't capture somebody, if I just kill them... Do I lose money?
[19:21.31]Do I lose honor?
[19:21.95]Like, how does it work?
[19:45.89]I'd pick the guy up.
[19:46.43]I'm about to train this guy, you're right.
[19:53.03]I can't take him off the horse.
[19:55.13]Oh, come on.
[20:10.21]Okay, let's get it like a more open area for this.
[20:14.09]Just put the horse in jail.
[20:15.89]There we go.
[20:16.53]Okay, now I can pick him up for some reason.
[20:18.98]Lie bounty is better than a dead one.
[20:24.72]Did you hear that?
[20:25.30]That...
[20:34.55]would break both your arms and your wrists and all your fingers one day is about all you got left I hope you and your wife and children rot in hell
[20:47.88]I liked your voice crack.
[20:48.98]Marston, come with me.
[20:50.76]The army sent reinforcements.
[20:51.72]Go.
[20:51.90]Yeah.
[20:52.20]Go with your puto.
[20:53.26]That jail cell really isn't even that bad.
[21:17.10]It really is just that they put a wall between you and the outside world.
[21:20.68]I'm just describing a jail cell.
[21:28.41]It's the same exact spot, except there's a little wall there.
[21:31.17]I'm gonna get on the cannon.
[21:42.90]Do I have to get on that specific cannon?
[21:46.64]Of course I do.
[21:55.65]Where am I going?
[21:56.39]I have no idea.
[21:58.23]I'm just talking and, like, walking at the same time because I have fucks.
[22:03.61]Really?
[22:05.17]Did he shoot over here?
[22:06.39]What are you shooting at?
[22:08.99]Watch your cannon fire, dude.
[22:14.54]No, that was fucking cool.
[22:27.55]Can we get him?
[22:28.88]Anymore?
[22:29.26]That's it.
[22:37.38]That was fun.
[22:44.12]That was pretty fun.
[22:45.44]Like the three shots I got to do.
[22:55.05]Slide this kid down.
[22:57.33]Watch your ankles there, Mr. Marston.
[23:00.23]Oh, they were trying to come get him.
[23:05.93]I get it, I get it.
[23:20.32]What's the hardest boss in Dark Souls?
[23:24.88]If you count Bloodborne, Orphan.
[23:27.78]If you don't count Bloodborne.
[23:31.89]I don't know.
[23:32.61]That's a hard question.
[23:33.73]That dragon was horrible.
[23:37.05]I forget what his name was from the DLC.
[23:49.55]Nameless King wasn't that terrible for me.
[23:51.69]He wasn't.
[23:52.29]Can we assume one of my commitments is cleared?
[23:55.13]Unfortunately, nothing is cleared.
[23:57.29]Hard or who I found is to be unfair?
[24:00.30]We need you to find Williamson, then head to Blackwater as quick as you can.
[24:04.30]We have reason to believe that Dutch Vanderland is in the area.
[24:12.41]Oh, your wife sends her regards.
[24:15.53]That's good.
[24:19.95]Medir, before you learn him, honestly, I just like twin princes the most.
[24:25.98]I just couldn't... That dragon, that fucking Dark Souls 3 DLC dragon... He just had like 65 billion health.
[24:34.51]It took so long to kill him.
[24:37.47]It was just painful for me.
[24:39.05]It was painful.
[24:41.73]Okay, we now have this open.
[24:45.57]Abraham is over here.
[24:47.96]Poppycock.

[27:26.57]Holy shit!
[27:27.97]What in the fucking hell?!
[27:30.23]What?!
[27:31.13]What is... Why are they alright here?!
[27:38.64]That was really odd.
[27:44.82]They're also walking by us.
[27:46.52]This guy's a rebel!
[27:50.12]That's a lady.
[27:53.56]Wait, these guys are rebels too?
[27:55.04]I don't... I'm so confused right now.
[28:01.17]That guy's also a rebel.
[28:02.95]That guy's gun broke in his hand.
[28:12.71]These guys are bad.
[28:16.80]I'm having trouble with this one, guys.
[28:24.95]Okay, the blue on the minimap scared the fuck out of me.
[28:27.53]I thought that was like an assassin coming to kill me.
[28:39.34]Okay, so there's a few more people in here that I have to get rid of.
[28:44.72]And this is not even part of the Freaks and Geeks?
[28:48.64]Is the goat a bad guy?
[28:54.04]There's these guys in the hideout.
[28:56.56]Huh?
[28:58.87]Are they on top?
[29:06.99]Oh, they're hiding right here.
[29:10.47]Really?
[29:10.83]Alright.
[29:11.93]There's one more guy.
[29:26.55]You know, we could talk this out if you wanted to.
[29:28.41]Ooh, he almost got you.
[29:32.24]Oh!
[29:32.50]A gun!
[29:33.38]Ooh, that one hurt me.
[29:34.98]Shoot him.
[29:38.10]The guy on the left is fucking useless.
[29:47.32]Why do they always have a billion HP?
[29:49.08]Is he alive?
[29:52.37]No, he's dead.
[29:55.01]He's dead.
[30:02.10]That's so stupid.
[30:15.99]Yeah, you know, the biggest weakness.
[30:18.80]Shoot him a thousand times, but water.
[30:20.82]I can't go in water.
[30:24.80]The AI can shoot me a hundred times, but if I touch water, I turn into the fucking Wicked Witch of the West.
[30:39.25]I was trying to do something sneaky there.
[30:45.59]This guy's burning.
[30:46.29]I got him.
[30:54.31]This guy's not appearing on the mini-map.
[31:08.00]That guy looks like my dad.
[31:17.26]Look at my dad.
[31:18.04]This is my dad.
[31:25.67]Hey, dad.
[31:31.35]I guess I just have to open these all up.
[31:33.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:35.15]You know what I was trying to say there.
[31:38.79]Maybe you don't.
[31:43.29]What was the goal with this?
[31:46.22]Open container?
[31:50.89]Is it just treasure in here?
[32:00.66]Oh, okay.
[32:12.72]And I'm right next to the freaking geek right there, so that's good.
[32:26.46]Through the window.
[32:27.00]Two more.
[32:28.22]Gotta get the boats.
[32:28.78]Can I reach that one?
[32:29.68]I believe so.
[32:29.98]Dude, easy, dad.
[32:30.74]I just blew this up on you.
[32:50.57]I'll take some cash for that, thanks.
[32:51.79]Is he still hiding behind a rock?
[32:53.13]Why are these guys statues?
[33:17.30]These guys look like when you go to a museum and you see the posed cowboys.
[33:22.99]Why are you guys doing this?
[33:27.31]Make a joke, please.
[33:28.38]This is not a joke stream right now.
[33:31.08]This is play video game stream.
[33:34.48]This is look at the street performers stream.
[33:45.65]He's just stalking them.
[33:46.81]What is he doing?
[33:47.87]Is that a bad guy?
[33:50.27]It is.
[33:50.87]No, it's not.
[33:51.44]What is this?
[33:54.24]That's not the general.
[33:55.98]Here's the general.
[33:56.54]Say museum again.
[33:59.42]Museum.
[33:59.60]Oh, sorry.
[33:59.82]Museum.
[34:18.11]Museum.
[34:18.83]It's a museum.
[34:33.01]Museum?
[34:39.47]Wear the coat?
[34:40.07]I will after I get this free cookie.
[34:43.15]He's over here, right on the dock.
[34:47.75]He's on this dock.
[34:49.15]Wherever they are.
[34:58.69]Oh, fucking come on.
[35:06.31]I wanted us to jump.
[35:07.23]I was trying to ghost ride the horse.
[35:11.04]No, fucking come on.
[35:12.96]I was trying to ghost ride the horse and I'm dead.
[35:15.20]And I'm fucking far away.
[35:19.64]The freaking geek is gone.
[35:29.13]I was trying to be cute and you can't be cute.
[35:41.52]What a dumb asshole I am.
[35:46.54]Alright, I look cool though.
[35:54.81]I was trying to be cute and just ghost ride the horse off the cliff.
[35:59.55]And everyone was going to laugh at the horse going in there.
[36:01.71]But we both went in.
[36:04.59]And now I have lost access to that mission.
[36:07.29]It's okay though.
[36:17.88]Local streamer figures out he isn't cute.
[36:22.84]No.
[36:25.66]Oh man, it's just a couple of Mondays.
[36:33.38]Still need to pick shit up.
[36:34.64]You know, I can go on like a skinning spree.
[36:40.27]Do you hear that?
[36:47.51]That sounds like a lady screaming.
[37:02.74]Dude, what the fuck?
[37:03.60]I was gonna, I was saying, you could go on like a skinning spree and make like 500 bucks.
[37:11.81]See, I got plus one deer meat, and I got deer, I got two things, I got deer meat and deer skin.
[37:18.12]That's good, right?
[37:20.62]That's good, right?
[37:33.87]There's five fingers, five finger filet.
[37:38.15]I ain't doing that.
[37:43.88]Let's just do a regular mission.
[37:50.14]What was that?
[37:55.95]Dude, this guy just like broke this lady's neck.
[37:59.89]Nobody seems to care.
[38:04.45]Wait, is he?
[38:04.79]Oh, no, he's... Okay.
[38:05.87]I was about to slit this guy's throat.
[38:07.35]I thought he was, like, fucking just done, like, murdering this lady.
[38:11.03]No, that was probably her father.
[38:12.35]I was about to kill this guy.
[38:18.39]Good thing I didn't.
[38:24.66]Wait a minute.
[38:25.08]I just got... I got $7 from that.
[38:30.37]She may have had some money on her.
[38:31.86]Alright, we'll just... I'm gonna pretend to be mourning.
[38:36.02]So awful, I know.
[38:38.00]How could this world be so cruel?
[38:39.76]I will avenge your daughter's death.
[38:46.45]And she had seven dollars.
[38:49.55]I can step on her a little.
[38:55.89]Get off the body.
[39:02.85]Sneaky.
[39:09.53]Thank you, Harmony.
[39:11.17]Harmony Accord for the $5.
[39:12.35]I appreciate the horse pudding again.
[39:14.07]I don't get this.
[39:15.86]You say this all the time.
[39:16.88]I don't even know what this means.
[39:20.76]If you're giving me $5, and Harmony, I've seen you give me money in the past.
[39:26.48]If I'm giving you horse pudding...
[39:29.28]Wouldn't that be the reverse?
[39:30.42]Like, it's probably $5 for a horse pudding.
[39:32.64]Whatever that is.
[39:34.46]So wouldn't you be giving me pudding?
[39:37.60]Regardless, thank you.
[39:39.68]Also, thank you to Breenland for the $2.50.
[39:42.89]Hey, Jerma, the get a haircut hippie thing during the PSVR stream was a joke.
[39:47.85]Your hair is fine.
[39:49.65]Glad to see you're enjoying Red Dead Redemption, though.
[39:51.31]It's one of my favorite Rockstar games.
[39:52.75]Duster outfit is the best.
[39:54.57]Yes.
[39:55.55]I agree.
[39:56.43]We didn't even get a cutscene, by the way.
[39:58.01]What is this?
[39:59.57]We didn't get a cutscene.
[40:01.53]We're just doing this now?
[40:03.77]This random guy just decided to start to pull his gun on me?
[40:06.19]I don't know what's happening here.
[40:08.00]Why are we doing this?
[40:17.82]No buttons are working, by the way.
[40:23.32]I was trying to make a fucking hysterical joke and I couldn't do it.
[40:26.69]So...
[40:28.53]Can't do it.
[40:29.13]And everybody in the chat is saying, shoot the guy, shoot the guy.
[40:32.07]I tried.
[40:32.40]It didn't work.
[40:45.43]Everybody wanted me to shoot that guy.
[40:46.53]It wasn't going to happen.
[40:58.93]So, I still don't get this.
[41:03.21]Like, do I have to shoot all the bullets out of the gun?
[41:07.64]Because I got one and I pressed right trigger and it didn't do anything.
[41:12.00]I don't understand this.
[41:15.03]Like, right bumper and then right trigger, right?
[41:17.11]It's not doing it.
[41:19.77]I have to fill the... So, I have to shoot every single time.
[41:22.55]I have to shoot all bullets.
[41:23.25]Okay.
[41:23.43]Okay.
[41:30.83]Wait, what?
[41:34.48]What the fuck is it?
[41:35.58]I don't- I don't understand this.
[41:42.16]I have to- so you have to fill the meter.
[41:54.44]Why does it seem so- I'm just gonna shoot him in the head fucking five times.
[42:04.50]I would have done that already, okay?
[42:08.90]Thanks, my brother.
[42:10.36]Now the people are finally ready.
[42:12.38]Today we overthrow the coronel.
[42:16.50]Well, first let me just steal some stuff from people.
[42:25.03]Senor, there are prisoners in jail who will fight on our side.
[42:28.75]Can you save them?
[42:30.41]Leave the speeches to me, John.
[42:32.60]You at least the prisoners.
[42:35.44]Go to the jail, okay.
[42:42.07]Censor?
[42:42.67]What do you mean, sensor?
[42:43.73]I need to get the sensor bar ready?
[42:51.92]Oh, I guess we're like liberating this place, huh?
[42:55.70]Okay.
[42:59.58]Well, I'm gonna use the shotgun for this one.
[43:06.94]Shoot the locks.
[43:11.06]Come on out.
[43:14.95]Don't stand that close.
[43:16.05]I don't want to shoot you accidentally.
[43:17.15]No.
[43:23.05]I don't have any grenades.
[43:25.67]We're not doing that.
[43:26.37]That's not what we came here to do.
[43:37.60]Sense of the horse pudding.
[43:45.22]Oh, you guys.
[43:48.30]You guys are such Garfield supporters.
[43:55.91]What do they have on him?
[43:56.63]Oh, he's still alive.
[43:57.33]Do these guys even have weapons?
[44:05.03]What are these people doing?
[44:07.85]Why would you do that?
[44:08.83]Those people just ran over there.
[44:15.57]That does sound like an insult.
[44:22.53]Let's talk about Garfield being used as an insult.
[44:27.51]You could say to somebody...
[44:29.95]Oh yeah dude, you're real fucking smart and you're real like funny.
[44:33.01]You like think Garfield is funny.
[44:35.73]I would be like, no I fucking don't.
[44:37.58]Shut up.
[44:38.56]That would tick me off.
[44:39.86]You could be like, oh your mother's a fucking piece of shit.
[44:42.78]And I'd be like, fuck you.
[44:43.90]You tell me, you think Garfield's funny?
[44:46.16]Shut the fuck up.
[44:47.76]How dare you.
[44:52.83]I don't want to die here.
[45:01.32]Germans with Garfield games.
[45:02.70]Let's have a little bit of fun here, what do you say?
[45:10.26]Have a little bit of fun, boys and girls!
[45:14.27]That was fun.
[45:15.59]I got him.
[45:16.01]He's on fire.
[45:29.22]It's like a bird sitting there that I hit instead of him.
[45:31.38]Dead.
[45:31.62]Dead.
[45:31.76]Dead eye dynamite.
[45:33.17]Pick up loot.
[45:54.90]Molotovs are the least satisfying weapon in the whole game.
[45:58.56]Unless you want a homing missile with pigeon.
[46:00.94]They're pretty dumb.
[46:04.94]Any more bodies?
[46:05.91]Uh-huh.
[46:06.21]Hold on.
[46:06.47]Machine gun?
[46:07.01]Sure thing.
[46:07.39]You got it.
[46:08.05]What does he want me to do?
[46:12.09]Blow open the door?
[46:28.78]Do not shoot the powder keg until Rey's men are clear.
[46:32.29]Oh, okay.
[46:33.55]No, we already know what's going to happen.
[46:35.29]I ain't doing it.
[46:39.85]We've done the funny laugh out loud, blow the guy up joke like fucking a hundred times.
[46:46.78]It's not happening anymore.
[46:47.82]It's a really convenient machine gun, though.
[46:53.40]Are they going to come through here?
[47:03.32]Don't run by the guy with the gatling gun.
[47:07.32]That's not smart.
[47:11.48]I think it's safe to go by now.
[47:14.91]It'll be just like jumping rope.
[47:22.01]No, I want fucking auto lock bullshit.
[47:24.58]It was locking on the same fucking pigeon over there.
[47:36.00]These other soldiers just may as well be mannequins.
[47:43.61]This is too much money to pass up, it really is.
[47:45.40]Alright, move it.
[48:01.22]Lord, this game was fun.
[48:03.86]I did like my time in the game so far.
[48:06.84]I don't speak that language, so you're going to have to give me... Protect.
[48:09.70]Okay.
[48:09.82]Easy.
[48:09.94]I'm going to dead-eye this.
[48:10.80]Oh, shit!
[48:27.15]Why did it tell me to come all the way back over here?
[48:35.51]Alright, let's turn it around.
[48:36.65]I was not prepared for that.
[48:42.76]I'm gonna die.
[48:47.42]I'm in deep shit, I gotta move.
[48:54.01]Why is the screen shaking?
[48:55.47]Oh my god.
[48:59.59]Why did it tell me to go up?
[49:02.31]We like breached and then I came back out.
[49:04.43]Why didn't I just stay on the Gatling gun?
[49:06.03]I don't understand.
[49:06.51]Hey, you know that thing you were just on?
[49:18.10]Go back outside and get on it.
[49:19.36]Get back on it!
[49:37.20]I think there's an overheater in there, right?
[49:44.82]Clearly shot that guy directly in the face, but it's alright.
[49:54.47]It's okay.
[49:54.85]He just shot his hat off!
[49:56.75]I shot that guy's fucking hat!
[50:01.76]Okay, you sure you want me to join, Raze?
[50:03.96]Is it gonna make me turn around and come back out here?
[50:09.67]Imagine losing only your hat After being shot up by like 500 bullets only to stand up and have your brain get melted from bullets Get out of the way
[50:35.70]I'm gonna go.
[50:41.20]Did I get him?
[50:53.77]I fucking clearly... Some guy fell out.
[50:55.73]You saw that.
[51:07.64]Some dude clearly fell out of the back of that horse.
[51:16.11]Come here, come on Lightning, let's go.
[51:18.37]Stop running away from me.
[51:22.34]Not with those Garfield paws of yours.
[51:25.26]Apparently not.
[51:28.72]Well, get over here.
[51:29.62]Am I gonna lose if I go too far away?
[51:35.73]Well, get the fuck over here, dude.
[51:37.13]Like, I don't understand.
[51:40.13]Are they still here?
[51:43.94]Did I win?
[51:54.00]Are they inside the stagecoach?
[52:01.77]Okay, we're good.
[52:07.32]I think I want to kill this guy.
[52:18.18]Take Williamson.
[52:19.24]Just let me live.
[52:20.70]I will leave the country.
[52:21.74]I promise.
[52:24.50]Which one of those is the real bad guy?
[52:25.74]You always was weak-minded.
[52:28.87]You're the one who let Dutch drive you insane.
[52:32.39]Dutch wanted you dead.
[52:35.46]I can't really walk around here.
[52:36.66]I want my horse to run him over.
[52:39.82]No, he almost did it.
[52:41.00]He was close.
[52:41.52]Oh shit, that was a good idea.
[53:08.14]I wanted to see what happened.
[53:09.00]I feel like you didn't shoot him.
[53:10.36]What if I see?
[53:10.90]He fucking KS'd me, man.
[53:11.88]Now that guy got like 242 gold.
[53:13.00]Sure, that was what happened.
[53:15.36]It was on purpose.
[53:15.86]Who was she again?
[53:35.97]Laura's day.
[53:36.47]Okay.
[53:36.67]Who wants to change the subject from sports to politics?
[54:04.26]It's always like, you know, you're not going to sit on the couch and do that.
[54:07.12]You know, the Red Shocks are doing really good this year, and I kind of like you as a person.
[54:13.92]Now let's hate each other and talk about politics.
[54:16.13]What a fucking Garfield, I know, really.
[54:17.21]Come on.
[54:35.18]Alright, cool.
[54:37.32]No more fancy words.
[54:39.06]Got 20 G for that.
[54:40.44]20 gold.
[54:41.14]20 golden horses.
[54:43.23]Alright.
[54:48.69]Raise rebel's outfit menu at... What is this?
[54:54.11]Why is there a witness over here?
[54:57.06]Pay witness $3?
[54:57.94]For what?
[55:00.72]What am I doing?
[55:01.10]What did I do?
[55:02.47]Alright, they transferred.
[55:03.35]She gave her like a relay.
[55:05.43]It's now a relay witness.
[55:07.63]She told her.
[55:08.84]Now she's the new witness.
[55:10.64]Did the price go up?
[55:12.80]$3 still.
[55:13.78]What did I do?
[55:14.92]Fucking arrest me.
[55:16.10]Somebody arrest me.
[55:16.96]Now.
[55:17.60]I want to know what happened.
[55:22.33]Go tell on me.
[55:22.99]I want to get arrested.
[55:23.65]I want to know what I did.
[55:31.12]You won't be fucking telling any tales, will you?
[55:35.96]There was a person in here!
[55:36.98]There was a fucking person in here!
[55:38.62]I didn't aim a gun at anybody.
[55:50.99]Go back and look.
[55:51.63]I didn't aim anything.
[55:55.89]There was no gun aiming.
[55:57.89]That's horse shit.
[55:59.70]I didn't do anything.
[56:09.11]How did I miss that person?
[56:10.03]Because that person was like gray and brown and like inside is gray and brown.
[56:15.60]Every character is gray and brown and orange.
[56:18.66]Look at like John Marston, right?
[56:21.31]I'm just gray, brown, and orange.
[56:25.75]Come on.
[56:30.09]We're just all different shades of gray.
[56:32.84]All of us.
[56:36.70]Everything is gray and brown.
[56:38.44]No, that wasn't a racial statement.
[56:40.41]I'm saying like the color scheme of the video game.
[56:50.59]Everything is just orange in this game.
[56:53.35]So when I go in a building and everything's orange, everyone's coats are like brown and orange.
[56:57.55]Look at me.
[56:58.33]Look at my character.
[57:10.78]Gracist.
[57:12.16]No.
[57:13.53]That wasn't what I was referring to.
[57:14.93]I bet this guy... Oh, yeah.
[57:19.03]Orange like Garfield.
[57:20.17]Yeah.
[57:20.47]And there's a G like... There's a G like Garfield.
[57:24.67]Even the pause menu is red.
[57:26.05]No, it just... Whatever.
[57:28.29]Let's go.
[57:28.71]I ain't gonna linger on this shit anymore.
[57:34.49]RIP, lady.
[57:36.04]Well, thank you, Matters of Darkness, for the $7.00.
[57:40.55]Much appreciated.
[57:43.01]I'll get some cougar pelts.
[57:46.31]I could.
[57:52.03]I just did another fucking campfire.
[57:58.18]Where am I?
[57:58.74]Where's the G?
[58:00.04]Where's Garfield?
[58:04.34]Holy shit.
[58:05.26]That's all the way up here.
[58:09.83]Wow, that... Really?
[58:13.09]That far away?
[58:13.81]Oh, my God.
[58:17.56]I have to go back to, like, America.
[58:29.16]Satan Worshipper Garfield.
[58:31.06]That's a weird one.
[58:46.30]Have I been here before?
[58:47.12]I don't think I have.
[58:50.02]There's another random dude over here.
[59:02.62]Can't go into any of these buildings?
[59:04.32]Aww.
[59:04.46]I want to see what this guy has to say.
[59:12.23]Now the opening.
[59:12.67]Wait, the censor bar is on the screen?
[59:14.01]No, it's not.
[59:14.73]No, it isn't.
[59:33.92]There is a certain individual spreading nasty rumors about Mr. Johns.
[59:39.38]I'd like you to put a stop to this vile gossip.
[59:42.50]Censor incoming, really?
[59:44.02]Suppose I can handle that.
[59:45.78]Really?
[59:45.98]For the right price.
[59:48.30]Now, this individual has had the misfortune to be photographed enjoying some rather inappropriate company.
[59:56.26]Been seen with a local whore.
[60:00.09]Take these photographs to him.
[60:04.17]After you take care of business, return to me and I will pay up the reward for your services.
[60:09.21]Ban them all.
[60:09.89]Ban them all.
[60:11.45]Ban them all.
[60:12.07]You're doing great things for your state, dear friend.
[60:15.51]I better be careful.
[60:16.17]I'm gonna get, like, stabbed in the back.
[60:21.89]Ban them all.
[60:24.09]Do it, mods.
[60:25.29]Ban them all.
[60:28.05]Sorry about those sapphires.
[60:34.69]Come on, that's relevant.
[60:35.57]I don't understand.
[60:50.18]That's a Game of Thrones reference.
[60:52.33]Game of Thrones.
[61:06.01]I like this guy, he's boring.
[61:32.80]Mr. Marston, so glad to see you.
[61:36.04]How was your journey?
[61:37.74]Where's my wife and son?
[61:39.56]Being well looked after.
[61:41.75]Well looked after.
[61:43.27]I want to see them.
[61:44.09]Mr. Ross wants to speak to you.
[61:45.85]We've had some important developments.
[61:48.71]You want me to take out a gun and blow a fucking hole in your head right here?
[61:52.89]Right now?
[61:53.40]You want that?
[61:54.40]Mr. Marston, I ask you to calm down.
[61:55.78]Why?
[62:00.24]Why, I did what you asked.
[62:01.90]I got you Williamson and Escuela.
[62:04.85]It's over.
[62:05.99]Stop playing games with me.
[62:08.89]No one's playing games with you, Mr. Marston.
[62:12.94]But if we were to play some games, there'd be some interesting ones we could play.
[62:16.50]This is gonna be fun.
[62:18.28]Like hanging you for murder.
[62:20.02]or confiscating all your property, like that little farm of yours, or having you put in an electric chair.
[62:25.62]Those are the sort of games we could play.
[62:27.70]But we choose to play a different game.
[62:30.25]So calm down and play along with us.
[62:33.67]Where's my wife?
[62:35.33]You don't forget.
[62:36.67]But I hear it's very nice this time of year.
[62:40.47]Mr. Marston, please.
[62:41.69]I've never insulted your meager intelligence.
[62:44.13]Do not insult mine.
[62:45.75]We've done this little deal for your freedom in exchange for all your... Go back up.
[62:51.16]It's gonna be worth it.
[62:53.84]We still don't have Vanderlyn, but now we know where he is.
[62:58.32]Then go and shoot him.
[63:00.27]No, sir.
[63:01.37]I want you to shoot him for me.
[63:04.43]And then I'll let you be.
[63:06.55]The last thing I want to do is make martyrs out of all of them.
[63:09.23]I think there's a cutscene going on.
[63:10.32]He could be killed by some petty squabble by another lowlife.
[63:14.36]We believe Vanderlinde is holed up with a group of renegades near the wreck of the Serendipity Riverboat.
[63:20.12]Ah, yes.
[63:21.74]Another group of renegades.
[63:24.54]Obviously the first group.
[63:26.90]Your group has, shall we say, been disbanded.
[63:32.06]Maybe like one more.
[63:33.04]One more will do.
[63:35.17]Shall we go?
[63:36.40]Oh, Mr. Marston, your wife and son are doing well.
[63:43.64]Let's both try to ensure things go well.
[63:45.58]What the fuck is that?
[63:48.97]This is a way better Garfield.
[63:51.43]Oh, fuck, I blew it.
[63:52.77]This is like a ten times better Garfield.
[63:56.25]Oh, Mr. Marston, one more thing.
[63:59.11]This is for you.
[64:00.93]You're too kind.
[64:02.22]See, I have nothing but your best interest at heart.
[64:06.53]Let's hope it doesn't go off by mistake.
[64:13.03]343.
[64:14.69]I have a patent for that, sir.
[64:16.11]This is an outrage.
[64:18.33]Oh, Mr. Marston.
[64:20.97]You're alive.
[64:21.69]Hello, Wes Dickens.
[64:22.97]I thought you were headed to Peking.
[64:26.13]So did I. So did I. Long story.
[64:28.93]But now it seems I'm being put under arrest and charged with narcotic possession or some other such nonsense.
[64:35.14]Ross, have him release this man.
[64:38.00]Why?
[64:39.56]Because he's a harmless old fraud.
[64:41.18]The kind of man that built this country.
[64:42.90]I told you we were going to fucking do this all day.
[64:46.13]Did you hear that, officer?
[64:47.35]The man's a hero.
[64:48.91]Let him go.
[64:49.41]This is what a sponsored stream feels like.
[64:51.79]344.
[64:51.81]345. 344.
[65:05.32]This is like a sponsored Garfield stream.
[65:07.78]Alright, but anyways, hold on.
[65:08.66]This is important.
[65:09.34]This is important.
[65:10.06]Look at this.
[65:11.94]This is what made me laugh.
[65:13.39]What is this fucked up Garfield?
[65:16.17]Look at this one.
[65:18.75]Like, what the fuck is this?
[65:24.07]This is a way better Garfield.
[65:28.25]That's like... I would read this comic if the Garfield looked like this.
[65:34.35]You know what I'm saying?
[65:35.43]Like, I would actually care about this.
[65:37.33]Alright, well, the joke's over.
[65:38.39]No more joke.
[66:00.10]O.G.
[66:00.24]Garfield.
[66:00.68]Leaf is the last one.
[66:01.86]I'm going to for a little while.
[66:14.26]Should I put in the title, like, sponsored by Garfield?
[66:17.25]It'd be like, why?
[66:20.69]Why would this stream be sponsored by fucking Garfield?
[66:23.63]Oh, wait a second, hold on.
[66:25.13]Hold on.
[66:25.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:29.28]Okay, this is so stupid.
[66:41.35]Look at that like fucking suggestive face he's making too.
[67:03.69]Keep quiet and stay close.
[67:06.03]Yes, sir.
[67:07.57]Vanderland is the priority.
[67:09.19]We go in, take him down, get the hell out of here.
[67:11.65]I don't know why this is making me laugh this much.
[67:13.71]It's his face.
[67:14.49]He's just Freddy.
[67:16.77]He's like looking at you.
[67:17.81]He's like, hey, yeah.
[67:19.53]It's me, Garfield.
[67:21.92]As you can see, I've decided to drift.
[67:27.04]I have no jokes.
[67:27.84]You know when you get lost in your own brain?
[67:29.60]That's where I am right now.
[67:41.27]I want people that randomly come into this fucking stream to be like, why the fuck is this happening?
[67:48.34]He needs to be bigger.
[68:04.71]You know what I mean?
[68:05.57]I want people that just came in here to be like, what the fuck, this guy?
[68:09.96]Like, this guy sucks.
[68:25.09]This seems like it's going to be a fun mission, too, and I'm just being like a dickhead.
[68:32.59]I need to rotate it.
[68:33.57]Hold on.
[68:33.87]Let me, like, rotate it.
[68:34.81]Can I?
[68:36.03]I don't think I can.
[68:36.79]I have to do, like, a free transform.
[68:39.23]No!
[68:39.65]No!
[68:39.77]No!
[68:39.87]No!
[68:39.93]No!
[68:40.01]No!
[68:40.07]No!
[68:40.21]No!
[68:57.42]We are not doing that.
[68:59.36]I'm not, no.
[69:01.34]In fact, the whole thing is going away now.
[69:04.95]In fact, goodbye.
[69:06.83]Goodbye.
[69:07.41]I ain't fucking getting in trouble over this one.
[69:18.97]What am I doing?
[69:19.89]What's the mission that we're doing right now?
[69:22.51]You know, the important thing?
[69:24.45]Not like, not like Garfield's like nine inch dick.
[69:27.60]Like, what, what, what, what were we doing?
[69:29.68]We were doing something.
[69:31.78]Okay.
[69:37.58]We were playing a fucking video game, last I checked.
[69:44.20]Do you use Garfield as the sensor now?
[69:47.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:49.06]Let me like... I love how I just... I get involved in these things.
[69:54.40]And I can't fucking... That's so stupid.
[70:07.47]Okay, this one's okay.
[70:08.69]I'm okay with this one.
[70:17.81]Put it over his eyes?
[70:18.87]No.
[70:18.97]Because this is going to be our censored image that we use.
[70:24.86]If something bad happens.
[70:29.22]No, I can't push him off.
[70:38.18]I'm just going to play the fucking game.
[70:44.74]Now, a lot of you are going to think I did that on purpose, which, like, I didn't.
[70:47.59]A lot of you are going to think I did that on purpose.
[70:50.53]And, like, what I was trying to do is I was trying... Like, that may have felt like it was on purpose, but it was not.
[70:57.05]It was not.
[70:57.65]And I'm going to... I will defend that forever.
[71:05.59]Holy shit.
[71:07.14]He just, like, screamed at me.
[71:09.38]He was like...
[71:13.95]Oh, God damn it.
[71:15.61]I got a new high-powered pistol.
[71:17.13]This looks like a deagle.
[71:29.99]Did it take this long to walk here last time, or was I just obsessed with Garfield?
[71:44.05]I'm taking it too far.
[71:45.73]I'm gonna... Fuck it.
[72:01.14]No, I can't.
[72:04.38]No.
[72:04.88]No, I can't.
[72:14.62]Alright, only, only, what kind of search, okay, I ain't doing that again.
[72:20.20]What kind of search is Garfield John Topless?
[72:27.73]Who would be, why would I be searching this?
[72:30.33]Don't search for that, by the way.
[72:38.08]This is not even close to what, what is this?
[72:42.10]Who the fuck is this guy?
[72:43.10]Is there a guy named... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:45.10]Okay, there's a guy named John Garfield.
[72:50.68]There's an actual person named John Garfield.
[72:58.22]So there's a guy, that was his name.
[73:04.64]Garfield John Shower is what I'm typing in.
[73:08.31]Well, this is quite a search history.
[73:14.26]I'm just looking for, like, John.
[73:15.63]Here we go.
[73:16.63]Perfect.
[73:20.07]Oh, no.
[73:21.31]No.
[73:22.95]No, I can't do this.
[73:24.29]I will get banned from twitch.tv if I do this.
[73:26.22]This joke is over.
[73:29.50]I could very easily get, like, reported and banned from Twitch if I were to do the thing I was about to do.
[73:36.33]Nope.
[73:39.63]See, we're gonna play video games on twitch.tv.
[73:43.61]Because this one... This... I'm just gonna go ahead and show you guys, because you need to know what I was talking about.
[73:53.76]I ain't doing this.
[73:55.02]And you best fucking believe I ain't doing this.
[74:00.30]Oh my god.
[74:03.01]You have to see what I'm talking about, though.
[74:06.35]Like...
[74:08.61]And to think, like, a simple, a simple, a simple sensor bar.
[74:14.13]A very simple sensor bar.
[74:16.75]Could change everything here.
[74:23.15]Oh, he's, like, watching.
[74:31.00]I ain't doing it.
[74:32.24]It's not gonna happen.
[75:03.51]Okay, get this off the fucking screen now.
[75:05.57]You gotta get it off.
[75:08.19]Oh, there I go.
[75:10.74]I'll see you guys later.
[75:15.18]It was fun.
[75:15.70]It was fun while it lasted.
[75:17.36]Somebody's screaming.
[75:27.14]Just add a sensor bar.
[75:28.82]Doesn't matter what it is.
[75:29.60]How do I get upstairs?
[75:38.93]What even got us on that?
[75:40.31]Why are we talking about like Garfield naked?
[75:44.65]And you know what?
[75:45.03]You don't even need a sensor bar for Garfield.
[75:46.71]Garfield is always naked, because Garfield is a cat.
[75:49.58]I have to keep going up, too.
[75:56.06]I'm gonna walk around.
[76:05.43]Don't reflect on that.
[76:06.53]You did that to us.
[76:12.19]Over here!
[76:13.45]I found him!
[76:14.23]Garfield's always naked in my dreams.
[76:16.33]It's a trap!
[76:16.99]It's a trap!
[76:18.67]It's Star Wars!
[76:21.72]It's a trap!
[76:23.42]Wait, I already did that joke before.
[76:25.80]I can't do that again.
[76:28.34]This sounds good.
[76:44.33]I can only use this pistol, huh?
[76:50.38]Where is he?
[76:51.78]Okay, I thought that guy was carrying somebody, too.
[76:54.52]I really did.
[76:58.32]What is wrong with you, genuinely?
[77:01.16]Like, you ask him, like, genuinely, what's wrong with me?
[77:05.97]Um...
[77:09.23]Attention, deficit hyperactivity disorder with a slight, uh, a slight tidbit of obsessive compulsive disorder.
[77:17.51]A mild case of depression.
[77:19.87]And, um, years of, years of Ren and Stimpy being, uh, my, my idols.
[77:28.75]There we go.
[77:32.25]And that, that, that's all the things that are potentially wrong with me, frankly.
[77:39.72]I gotta just snooze him.
[77:47.31]Relatable streamer.
[77:49.75]Come on, show your head.
[77:52.99]You guys are playing whack-a-mole over here, come on.
[78:02.54]Let me just do this.
[78:04.28]That works too, right?
[78:05.54]It does.
[78:11.11]He's the perfect being.
[78:18.89]You know, like, I thought about it... Like, I'm thinking about it right now.
[78:23.41]Imagine if I got, like, banned from Twitch because of that.
[78:26.75]That would be, like, by the magnum opus, right?
[78:28.42]Imagine getting banned from Twitch because you were putting a censor bar on, like, Garfield comics.
[78:39.36]That's, like, next level.
[78:44.52]Oh, shoot.
[78:48.22]Still alive.
[78:50.48]Okay.
[78:57.43]Quite the opposite.
[79:00.75]Wait, what did I miss?
[79:01.77]Oh, you missed... For some... I don't know why.
[79:04.45]I told you guys.
[79:05.21]I fucking told you guys this was gonna happen.
[79:09.32]I told you guys!
[79:11.10]I couldn't get off the fucking Garfield thing.
[79:13.18]I said one Garfield reference, and all of a sudden, like, it's a Garfield stream.
[79:16.42]And, like, I knew it was gonna happen.
[79:18.14]I fucking was certain this was gonna turn into a fucking Garfield stream, and it did.
[79:21.84]I knew it.
[79:26.79]I knew this was gonna happen.
[79:36.11]+2 Mario reference.
[79:37.41]What?
[79:37.65]What?
[79:42.54]The streamer cannot get off to- The streamer cannot get off the Garfield joke, cannot get- Oh god, no, I read that wrong.
[79:52.37]Fucking Garfield.
[79:54.73]What the hell am I doing?
[79:55.83]The one million dollar joke.
[80:12.52]Am I driving the car?
[80:14.04]No.
[80:14.74]I can't skip this, either.
[80:16.62]Well, I have a second here.
[80:17.38]Thank you, MegaDragon, for the buck.
[80:18.40]+2, well, thank you.
[80:19.14]DJM, or DJ Envy.
[80:39.40]The MB man.
[80:42.14]Terrible at reading.
[80:43.80]Thanks for the bits.
[80:44.34]I came back from cooking dinner at the right moment, apparently.
[80:48.37]Or the wrong moment, depending on how you look at it.
[80:52.93]Thank you, guys.
[80:59.04]Can I skip this yet?
[81:02.68]Why did I not skip this?
[81:04.60]Just a couple of guys, like, riding a car.
[81:14.55]Well, it's gonna be a broken down car and it's gonna pop up and shoot us.
[81:17.07]Ah, the car breaks down.
[81:20.25]We're gonna get swarmed.
[81:24.25]This guy's just like sleeping in the back.
[81:45.26]By the way, by the way, I don't think I don't think I have to say this like But let me say it just to make sure Do not post any links in the chat of like pornography Did you post a link?
[82:00.43]Shit better be like fucking PG-13 Where's my crosshair?
[82:17.12]Shoot!
[82:25.95]Let's do it again.
[82:38.01]And mods are gonna have to like work a little time there.
[82:42.77]No pornographic links.
[82:48.12]regardless of the subject matter.
[82:52.95]I need a sensor bar.
[82:53.93]We need sensor bars for like chat.
[83:08.42]No, no, I ain't going down this rabbit hole, guys.
[83:10.55]No way.
[83:10.77]Not a chance.
[83:32.85]No Garfield What have I done what the fuck have I done here we are
[83:46.17]I don't know.
[83:46.99]I opened up a can of worms here.
[83:55.92]Sub only.
[83:57.06]Got to throw it in sub only mode because of Garfield pornography.
[84:00.53]Like, really?
[84:01.61]This is what we're going to have to go into sub only mode for?
[84:06.97]Of all the things to go to sub only for?
[84:09.15]Mr. Fordham?
[84:10.07]Good day.
[84:10.85]Good day.
[84:11.85]What on Earth's going on here?
[84:13.77]Is that what we're going to do this for?
[84:15.85]Beat up pretty good.
[84:16.63]We'll send a doctor.
[84:17.84]Now, McDougal.
[84:20.94]We need information from this fellow.
[84:23.86]What the fuck is going on?
[84:25.72]What have I done?
[84:28.52]Make sure you do.
[84:30.31]Didn't want this to turn into a Garfield stream and it did Bada-bing thanks for the buck.
[84:34.08]What did I just tune into?
[84:35.68]I don't know.
[84:36.06]Let's just pretend none of this happened.
[84:38.74]Let's just move.
[84:39.18]Let's move on from
[84:54.96]Let's move on.
[84:55.98]Oh, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[84:57.84]Everybody, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[85:00.43]Hey.
[85:01.81]I can't whistle, by the way.
[85:02.85]I used to have a dog.
[85:05.97]And I'm not being able to whistle myself.
[85:10.13]He always came to whistling.
[85:12.84]So somebody would whistle, like my mother would whistle, and she could be like, I can't whistle.
[85:18.28]So I used to have to go like this.
[85:20.07]Hoo-hoo!
[85:21.27]That was me whistling when I was like 16, like 15.
[85:24.73]Like all the way down to like 8 years old.
[85:27.87]Hoo-hoo!
[85:29.59]Hoo-hoo!
[85:32.15]I'm not kidding, that's exactly what I did.
[85:35.49]To mimic a whistle.
[85:36.31]Let's watch a fucking $2 movie.
[85:46.31]I don't know how to whistle.
[85:49.85]I ain't clicking any links.
[85:52.93]I can fucking guarantee you that, regardless of what they are.
[85:55.43]Thank you, though, for the $5.
[85:56.39]It was hoo-hoo.
[86:24.30]A fat lady walked by.
[86:25.54]Am I more of a dog person or a cat person?
[86:37.13]I am a dog person.
[86:39.17]Cats are okay.
[86:39.99]I've had a lot of cats before.
[86:41.77]Okay.
[86:56.14]Thank you, Dusky Dude or Dubsky Dude.
[86:58.90]I for one welcome our Garfield overlords.
[87:00.80]Actually, I haven't even been watching this movie.
[87:12.63]This better end with a Molotov.
[87:14.37]Jesus.
[87:24.18]I just keep harping back to... What the fuck does that last, like 20 minutes?
[87:38.11]Really?
[87:43.82]Home sweet home!
[88:04.40]So we have these things you guys are sending me.
[88:08.69]On Twitter.
[88:09.15]You guys are fucking crazy.
[88:11.59]You guys are crazy.
[88:15.33]Wait, did I put the wrong link?
[88:19.37]What?
[88:19.89]What did I do?
[88:21.21]I didn't... Why is this link not working?
[88:32.74]Wait, what did I miss?
[88:35.29]Was there a censor?
[88:43.57]I'm looking at the fact that my fucking link in Twitter didn't even work.
[88:52.96]What is this movie?
[88:54.20]What the fuck are we watching?
[89:01.46]What in the fucking name of God?
[89:03.18]He's not gonna punch this- I thought he was gonna like punch this lady or something.
[89:12.09]Oh, they're gonna train him.
[89:40.94]Don't turn Uncle Sam into Aunt Samantha.
[89:46.12]Oh my god.
[89:48.70]Okay, well, where's my achievement?
[89:53.10]Did you just guys hear that noise?
[89:54.94]What the fuck?
[89:58.11]I thought you guys told me I get money for this.
[90:02.77]Well, we just got to watch a... That was a video.
[90:07.43]That was a video, alright.
[90:09.77]Let's play a little blackjack.
[90:11.21]50 bucks.
[90:11.47]Let's try to get blackjack.
[90:19.25]Let's go ahead and give a $50 bet.
[90:25.27]I got the most money here.
[90:26.31]We got a 7.
[90:28.97]We have an awful... This is an awful hand.
[90:30.79]Okay, he has 17.
[90:31.05]I have 17.
[90:31.33]No, that...
[90:39.17]I can't.
[90:40.07]I have to stand.
[90:44.11]It's doubling down.
[90:47.45]And we got... Okay.
[90:48.79]Come on.
[90:50.19]Woo!
[90:51.58]Oh!
[90:52.04]Hoo-hoo!
[90:53.18]Got it.
[90:53.76]Hoo-hoo!
[90:56.26]One more.
[91:01.57]I got a two.
[91:02.01]What the hell is that?
[91:03.92]It looks like a corkscrew.
[91:05.78]What is that?
[91:06.16]A three?
[91:06.56]A three, four, five.
[91:07.44]I don't know.
[91:07.88]I don't know.
[91:09.52]I don't know.
[91:10.64]Double down.
[91:11.24]Double down for me.
[91:15.12]That's black enough.
[91:26.38]I made it.
[91:27.00]Hold on.
[91:28.26]Let's talk about what happened there.
[91:30.36]I was making a shitty joke and then I actually pressed because it's a fucking Xbox controller.
[91:39.44]It's an Xbox controller.
[91:41.88]Remember.
[91:42.86]So I hit the wrong button.
[91:45.20]That's just what happened.
[91:49.96]And there we go.
[91:50.36]We're going to get our money back.
[91:58.34]Do I look stupid?
[91:59.66]I'm staying.
[92:01.74]I gotta get my money back.
[92:04.28]It's a fucking, it's a fucking push.
[92:08.45]A craftsman doesn't blame his tools.
[92:10.01]Yes, he does.
[92:12.81]You go to like, go to fucking Home Depot and go get like a $30 drill.
[92:17.53]And then go to Home Depot and get like a fucking $400 drill.
[92:23.01]You tell me there's a difference.
[92:24.17]Blackjack.
[92:25.05]Everything okay, ma'am?
[92:27.06]Give me a card.
[92:37.30]That's how we do it, boys and girls.
[92:38.48]He's like showing 17 potentially.
[92:42.25]You gotta hit.
[92:42.67]You have to.
[92:43.09]It sucks, but you have to.
[92:43.89]Fucking push again.
[92:56.80]One more.
[92:58.10]One more, we're gonna double down.
[92:59.08]No matter what, we're doubling down.
[93:05.12]Seven, eight, nine.
[93:05.80]What has he got?
[93:12.64]No, this is... No, we're getting a bad time to do it.
[93:16.70]And if I had fucking double downed... If I had double downed... We have... I can't.
[93:22.55]We're gonna lose.
[93:23.63]Because he's gonna have fucking 20.
[93:27.37]Nope, 17.
[93:28.13]He's fucked.
[93:30.23]Alright, now we're gonna double down no matter what.
[93:33.89]Double down no matter what.
[93:46.43]Give it to me.
[93:46.81]Give me a face card.
[93:47.47]Come on.
[93:48.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[93:50.80]Wait a minute.
[93:51.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:55.34]What happened?
[93:55.92]Oh, shit.
[94:02.69]I thought it was... Alright, we're gonna double down no matter what.
[94:14.84]No, we're not.
[94:16.08]We're gonna fucking... We're just gonna lose.
[94:17.46]I should've hit.
[94:22.78]I should've hit that.
[94:25.17]I guess it's gonna be 20 and I'm gonna lose.
[94:26.87]I'll lose.
[94:28.91]Fucking damn it.
[94:30.09]I don't think you... God damn it!
[94:45.11]No, no insurance.
[94:50.21]He's gonna have blackjack and I'm gonna lose.
[94:51.65]I'm gonna lose a fucking $200.
[94:53.15]He has blackjack.
[94:53.83]Game over.
[94:56.27]Okay.
[94:57.01]What do you mean?
[94:58.17]We all lose.
[95:05.36]He busted.
[95:08.92]You don't ever take insurance.
[95:11.72]No, he doesn't have blackjack.
[95:13.52]But I... I push, whatever.
[95:19.29]I have to win one more hand.
[95:25.01]Come on, blackjack.
[95:27.65]No, that's not... I don't want two Jack.
[95:29.67]Or three Jack.
[95:30.43]That's not what I wanted.
[95:31.19]What does he have?
[95:32.37]A six.
[95:37.99]My brother's gonna kill me.
[95:40.09]My brother's gonna kill me.
[95:42.79]Oh, god damn it.
[95:44.99]I can't... You don't do this.
[95:50.62]You stand if he's showing a six.
[95:52.72]Because he's going to face guard and he's going to bust.
[95:56.46]And there it is.
[95:56.92]Watch this.
[95:57.26]Now he's going to... It's over.
[95:58.92]Okay.
[95:59.48]See, my brother didn't kill me this time.
[96:02.10]My brother would have fucking grabbed my hand and been like... What the fuck are you doing?
[96:05.59]Alright, I won.
[96:06.93]Let's go.
[96:07.21]Not a lot of fun.
[96:14.51]I should have actually stayed before that.
[96:19.83]I'll be back to even?
[96:20.65]I don't even know.
[96:28.99]I won.
[96:29.61]Lost 100 chips.
[96:31.31]Whatever.
[96:32.81]Who cares?
[96:33.91]It's not all about winning.
[96:36.09]It's about sending a message.
[96:38.73]The Joker!
[96:41.42]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[96:44.73]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[96:47.89]Just looking to see what's new.
[96:50.09]Hey, what's new?
[96:54.85]Great plains, moonshine, horse pills.
[96:57.17]This is all stuff I don't want.
[96:59.39]Sell his deer meat.
[97:00.63]Sell his deer skin.
[97:05.14]You sent the message that you suck at blackjack.
[97:06.88]What are you talking about?
[97:09.24]You...
[97:11.55]Blackjack just requires a very basic understanding of the game.
[97:18.71]If you're talking about me accidentally pressing double down, it's because it's an Xbox controller.
[97:24.50]An F-U-C-K Microsoft.
[97:28.20]Dynamite.
[97:29.56]Okay.
[97:31.06]I can afford some of this.
[97:32.08]I can afford one of these now.
[97:35.91]Buffalo Rifle, Evans Repeater, Garcano Rifle.
[97:40.71]Power range.
[97:42.43]Reload speed.
[97:51.03]Mauser pistol.
[97:51.89]I already bought a pistol.
[97:53.37]Holy shit.
[97:54.05]This thing is fast.
[98:07.02]Reload a little faster.
[98:10.78]I don't really... Sniper rifles aren't... Using the sticks to use the sniper rifle kind of hurts my brain.
[98:15.82]I don't think I want a rifle.
[98:19.11]So we think... Can I get the Mauser pistol for free?
[98:25.41]I feel like I have a lot of pistols though.
[98:29.71]Like too many pistols.
[98:34.99]I kind of want this.
[98:38.17]Very high capacity.
[98:48.23]What does this take for ammo?
[98:50.63]Repeater ammo, I'm going to assume.
[98:54.57]Basic coordination hurts.
[98:55.89]No, aiming with thumbsticks hurts.
[98:59.75]I'm getting the repeater.
[99:03.37]Exquisite taste, apparently.
[99:04.50]How much ammo do I have in this thing?
[99:06.04]Oh, that's 22 rounds.
[99:06.64]That's actually really good.
[99:17.18]I have a lot of repeater ammo, too, so... We'll give it a try.
[99:20.92]Looks like it's pretty good.
[99:23.42]Now let's go to, uh... Let's go back to G.
[99:31.50]22 Deadeye shots.
[99:32.30]Oh, wow.
[99:33.10]That actually is really good.
[99:35.10]And I like this pistol.
[99:36.08]I like the Deagle.
[99:37.52]The Deagle's good.
[99:38.12]Let's go to G. Let's go to Garfield's.
[99:53.03]Thank you, PlayStation 2, for the bits.
[99:55.45]Hello, Garfield.
[99:56.42]Me and my girlfriend love your stream.
[99:58.00]Always makes us laugh.
[99:58.94]Well, thanks.
[99:59.50]Thanks for the bits.
[100:00.34]Ah, yes.
[100:00.56]The famous Wild West pistol.
[100:01.60]The Desert Eagle.
[100:26.33]I have never beaten Red Dead Redemption.
[100:28.33]I have never played Red Dead Redemption until last week.
[100:31.87]This is the first time I've ever played it blind.
[100:33.32]Completely.
[100:35.20]And I gotta say, pretty good.
[100:38.84]Pretty good.
[100:46.41]Dutch's boys hitched them there.
[100:47.87]They'll have to run that way to make their escape.
[100:50.03]So shoot all the horses.
[100:50.71]Don't start shooting until they're out in the open.
[100:52.50]If we spook them, they might retreat back and hole up inside.
[100:55.74]Don't shoot till I give you the signal.
[100:57.78]This is like a hitman mission.
[100:58.40]Keep your sights straight on that bank door.
[101:01.46]Keep your sights straight on that banker.
[101:03.50]Okay.
[101:04.92]Don't shoot till I give you the signal.
[101:08.12]Why the hell are you aiming at me?
[101:11.48]Someone's coming out.
[101:12.24]He's unarmed.
[101:13.14]Hold your fire.
[101:14.18]I'm dragging you out of here.
[101:16.02]The bastard's killed.
[101:17.36]Open fire.
[101:21.78]Get the man at the window.
[101:24.26]Oh my god.
[101:24.84]Got him.
[101:32.37]Goddamn sludge controllers.
[101:34.29]Ugh.
[101:36.73]Ugh.
[101:43.44]Where are they?
[101:50.27]I got it right here.
[101:52.09]Fucking stick hammock.
[102:10.68]You must just have to get really used to it, but man, like... I feel like I'm playing Street Fighter right now.
[102:17.46]I have to go, like, down, up, and around A to do, like, a... Who?
[102:21.91]Where?
[102:25.39]What are we shooting at?
[102:35.63]Down here?
[102:36.09]Oh, he's right there.
[102:44.83]Really?
[102:52.95]He's not escaping, he's just a bullet sponge.
[102:56.20]Okay, we're good.
[102:57.74]He's still shooting.
[102:58.70]That grand finale sucked.
[103:15.48]Let's try the new rifle.
[103:19.37]I don't want the Winchester repeater.
[103:22.79]I want my Evans repeater.
[103:23.95]You live right there.
[103:28.16]Why don't you do it?
[103:41.08]No, that's a good guy.
[103:42.86]There's no more bad guys that are, like, showing their faces, so... Oh, there was a guy there, actually.
[103:51.84]See how, like, dark it is in here?
[103:53.00]This is what I was talking about.
[103:55.68]Look at how, like, dark this whole room is.
[103:57.22]And look at how orange it is.
[104:00.36]Help me!
[104:02.56]Please!
[104:04.50]Help!
[104:05.84]Jesus Christ!
[104:06.42]Oh, my God!
[104:09.14]Help me!
[104:12.27]So like everyone was like, how did you miss that guy?
[104:14.07]Because every room is like just dark.
[104:16.19]Oh god!
[104:40.88]No.
[104:42.30]No.
[104:43.26]Thank god I don't have to do that again.
[104:47.56]That guy's head.
[104:48.46]That guy went out of hand.
[104:52.74]Alright, let's go.
[104:55.90]Come on.
[104:56.42]I don't get time for this.
[104:58.17]Oh my lord.
[105:11.57]Look at all of them.
[105:14.31]You guys are behind bank vaults.
[105:15.75]It's not fair!
[105:20.62]Please!
[105:21.20]I do like this rifle though.
[105:28.95]It's very good.
[105:39.21]Alright.
[105:40.53]Let's not fuck this up.
[105:48.31]Just shoot him once.
[105:52.32]That's all we gotta do.
[105:53.28]I just heard like a lot of gunfire there.
[105:58.58]Anything else?
[106:06.64]Perhaps shoot him but one single time.
[106:08.40]Yeah, not 22 times.
[106:12.28]That would be ideal.
[106:13.18]Let's do double tap on each one of these guys for fun, you know?
[106:29.21]This is really good though.
[106:31.17]I can see that being extremely effective.
[106:34.84]Wait, there are safes in here.
[106:37.34]There are safes in here.
[106:39.06]No, I can't open them.
[106:45.79]Oh, it's nice to see you, John.
[106:48.11]Hello, Dutch.
[106:51.39]This is Abigail.
[106:53.19]Well, I hope... I ain't seen her for a while.
[106:55.95]Because you've been chasing me?
[106:59.65]Let the woman go, Dutch.
[107:00.84]Of course.
[107:03.84]Of course.
[107:05.93]How's your little boy?
[107:07.79]He ain't so little now.
[107:09.76]No, he must be what?
[107:11.96]Fifteen?
[107:13.70]Sixteen?
[107:14.98]Doesn't time fly?
[107:17.86]Don't adjust.
[107:20.18]It's over, man.
[107:22.36]Of course.
[107:24.78]Of course.
[107:27.19]I surrender, John.
[107:30.17]You're the master now.
[107:32.38]I've been my master since you left me to die.
[107:34.92]I could just dead-eye, right?
[107:35.88]Then get him.
[107:36.62]We all make mistakes, John.
[107:38.34]Might let him.
[107:39.20]I never claimed to be a saint.
[107:41.36]But equally, I never took you for an errand boy.
[107:47.08]Just trying to help my family, Dutch.
[107:49.52]By making compromises we all have to.
[107:51.53]Now let her go.
[107:53.17]It's over.
[107:55.13]You want the girl, John?
[107:58.39]You always were the romantic sort.
[108:01.65]You know, gentlemen, this man here, oh, he married a whore.
[108:08.37]Used to ride with us.
[108:11.45]We all had her.
[108:13.41]Oh, but he married her.
[108:14.86]This guy here, he reached Garfield.
[108:17.30]I'm sorry.
[108:18.46]We've got to get away from that.
[108:21.06]He's a better man.
[108:24.42]Have the girl, John.
[108:26.54]Easy, Dutch.
[108:27.76]She's a parting gift from me.
[108:30.92]Whoa!
[108:35.85]Wait, was that... Was that like my wife?
[108:42.58]I don't understand.
[108:43.60]Was that a major important person?
[108:48.30]What?
[108:48.80]I thought he was talking about, oh, this is your wife right here.
[108:54.45]Like, oh no, my wife.
[108:55.89]He just shot that lady in the head and it's just like, oh shit.
[108:58.99]Let's go get him.
[109:12.18]Okay.
[109:13.58]Oh, he was just talking shit about your wife.
[109:15.44]I thought he was saying that, hey, this is your wife.
[109:17.09]Okay.
[109:17.23]Because he's like, oh, I would have shot the woman.
[109:20.33]Like, wait, what?
[109:31.80]You have fantastic comprehension skills, Jerma.
[109:35.20]We already talked about my learning disabilities.
[109:37.82]We're not gonna talk about them again.
[109:39.54]Plus I'm reading chat too.
[109:49.67]The cutscenes are like an opportunity for me to read chat.
[109:52.19]Come on.
[109:52.85]Are we going to finish the game tonight?
[109:55.03]I mean, how much more is there?
[109:57.07]How much further, how much longer do we have?
[109:59.82]I was going to try to get it done by Wednesday.
[110:02.50]If this wasn't done tomorrow, after tomorrow's stream, I was going to stream on Wednesday too and try to finish it.
[110:22.11]Into the forest.
[110:23.16]Woah, that... That's not one of his men.
[110:24.68]Of course it isn't.
[110:31.28]And everything's fucking orange.
[110:54.78]I gotta get off this fucking horse.
[111:08.55]Fucking Garfield vision.
[111:26.06]I'm not gonna fucking sprint in there again.
[111:27.84]I just shot my fucking horse.
[111:40.98]Good thing we got auto-aim, because I can't see anything.
[111:43.07]I can't see what I'm doing.
[111:44.83]Oh my god.
[111:46.49]Yep.
[112:12.74]Why is the shotgun always auto-equipping itself?
[112:18.88]Has anybody figured that out yet?
[112:23.92]Why is the right side of the wheel the one that gets auto-equipped?
[112:28.30]I didn't pick that shit.
[112:48.21]That ain't gonna... Just fucking drink the snake oil.
[113:07.57]These guys blend in so well, these guys may as well just be fucking rocks.
[113:11.11]Like, really.
[113:24.86]At least I shot him through the rock.
[113:25.94]That's fine.
[113:33.03]You know the problem is I'm playing this mission at, like, night.
[113:39.51]Keep my horse close.
[114:03.84]What are we gonna talk about Otto?
[114:05.73]What happened to Otto?
[114:07.03]Otto's fine.
[114:07.71]He's like upstairs being a dog.
[114:11.43]Hitchy head.
[114:11.81]Otto's upstairs being a dog.
[114:18.35]Why is everybody saying Otto died?
[114:20.10]What are you guys talking about?
[114:36.82]Otto is very much alive.
[114:41.65]Horse.
[114:43.29]Horse, this is not a spot for you to be in.
[114:44.77]It just isn't, dog.
[114:46.51]Dog, I mean horse.
[114:48.55]Behind the tree.
[114:56.93]Where you at?
[115:00.42]Right there.
[115:06.08]That worked.
[115:12.25]Meet the agents in the cabin.
[115:13.59]Prove that he's alive.
[115:17.25]What are you talking about?
[115:19.67]He's upstairs.
[115:20.93]I'm not going to go get him.
[115:23.19]Scared to shoot him?
[115:24.16]Too much to handle?
[115:26.16]When the opportunity presents itself, I'll put a bullet in him.
[115:29.70]Don't you worry.
[115:30.84]Won't like myself for doing it, but I'll do it.
[115:36.88]Use the automatic pistol.
[115:45.08]What capture card am I using?
[115:47.68]Well, right now I'm using the Elgato Game Capture HD 60.
[115:53.35]And I don't like it at all.
[115:57.79]There's like a full two second input delay on everything you do.
[116:03.80]And trying to sync your voice with the game.
[116:07.00]I have to offset my microphone.
[116:10.60]Like when I'm talking right now, you guys are hearing me like a second and a half late through the game.
[116:15.69]Because I have to sync the game.
[116:18.29]If I have a webcam on, it's even more difficult.
[116:21.25]And even when you do sync it, even when you do, sometimes it just don't matter.
[116:26.72]And it's going to be different like 50% of the time.
[116:33.74]And then, you know, after having all the complaints about the Elgato, I got the internal Elgato HD Pro capture card, which goes into a PCI Express slot.
[116:48.34]Well, the first week of me owning it, it did not get recognized by my computer, like as if it wasn't even plugged in.
[116:58.67]And after I changed PCI slots, I tried everything, it didn't work.
[117:04.34]Randomly, for no reason.
[117:05.64]It just decided to recognize it one day.
[117:08.98]All updated firmware, all updated drivers, everything was fine.
[117:13.07]And it blue screens my computer every time I use it.
[117:19.15]Another fantastic Elgato product.
[117:24.09]Are these buffaloes?
[117:25.57]Holy shit.
[117:26.47]Talk about skinning and getting fucking money.
[117:29.24]Oh my.
[117:39.19]Talk about fucking making lots of money, guys.
[118:00.44]This is gonna take a long time.
[118:07.51]Why did I shoot that one three times?
[118:12.83]Look at all this Deadeye.
[118:19.95]How long does Deadeye last?
[118:22.63]I guess I can keep moving.
[118:32.87]Alright, there we go.
[118:34.27]Off the horse.
[118:39.73]Let's skin some buffalo.
[118:45.81]Can I skip this?
[118:52.67]This will make me at least a couple hundred dollars.
[118:58.79]Oh, God.
[118:59.09]This is going to take me.
[119:00.13]Buffalo horns.
[119:02.59]Buffalo meat.
[119:07.32]Um... Did I just do that for no reason?
[119:13.70]There's no other buffalo corpses.
[119:14.98]I just killed, like, 15 things.
[119:16.48]Alright.
[119:25.83]Well, there's...
[119:33.79]And I got to skin one.
[119:35.05]And there's one more body over here.
[119:36.55]Come on.
[119:49.25]Whatever.
[119:49.55]Yeah, I know that the black X's on the mini-map, but there's none here.
[120:05.81]It's okay, we can do it again with the fucking Jack-o-lanterns.
[120:23.65]What am I doing?
[120:24.43]What are you talking about?
[120:29.53]What do you mean?
[120:29.99]They're on the other side of the hill.
[120:35.94]I killed like fucking ten of them and they weren't anywhere to be found.
[120:38.40]There's like one over here.
[121:02.13]There's one here.
[121:04.27]Here they are.
[121:07.03]Like, I was going to find them eventually, guys.
[121:08.59]I was looking for the black X's.
[121:17.47]Everybody calm down.
[121:23.45]Jerma, learn directions.
[121:26.51]Look where we are right now.
[121:29.55]We're in the middle of the open fucking field.
[121:32.93]And it's raining and gray.
[121:37.62]Like, give me like fucking 30 seconds.
[121:44.42]Learn directions.
[121:45.18]You're in the middle of a gigantic open field with no discernible landmarks.
[121:51.40]How could you not know that there was a buffalo over there, you fucking idiot?
[121:56.05]You fucking idiot!
[122:11.99]Also, I have to re-chat.
[122:15.05]Okay, here's what I want you guys to do, right?
[122:17.07]Here's what I want you to do.
[122:18.25]The next time you're playing a game, I would like you to have... Have, like, a book over on your left, right?
[122:29.58]And you gotta read that fucking book that's on your other monitor while you're playing the game.
[122:36.92]So play the game, open up a fucking, get a book on the other side, and every like 12 to 15 seconds, while you're playing, by the way, while you're still playing, go read the book too.
[122:48.23]Sometimes, sometimes you're gonna miss direction.
[122:51.95]Sometimes you're gonna miss direction.
[122:53.19]It's gonna happen.
[123:00.40]Chat equals a book.
[123:05.39]Oh, by the way, reply to your book, too.
[123:09.46]You know, like, while you're reading your book.
[123:14.22]Like, respond out loud to the words in the book.
[123:19.90]Come on.
[123:27.09]Reading books is hard in general.
[123:29.17]Hey, where are you going?
[123:32.51]Stop running away from me.
[123:39.24]Does that mean we pay attention to 1% of the book?
[123:41.98]I read, I fucking read almost everything you guys write.
[123:45.30]Give me at least 10% credit here.
[123:56.99]Streamer complains about being streamer.
[123:58.97]No, no, I'm not complaining.
[124:00.81]I love streaming.
[124:01.49]I love you guys.
[124:02.15]I love streaming.
[124:03.01]But, um, like, if I turn around and I misdirect for a second...
[124:11.22]Lower the rope a little.
[124:12.30]You know what I mean?
[124:14.52]Don't just kick the chair out from underneath me.
[124:17.28]Lower the fucking rope a little.
[124:19.64]Skunk.
[124:22.20]No, never mind.
[124:25.98]Hello there.
[124:26.32]Are you reading this right now?
[124:27.20]Yeah, I am actually.
[124:29.84]If you read this, you're smelly.
[124:30.90]Oh, am I?
[124:31.80]Interesting.
[124:33.56]By the way, go back to YouTube.
[124:36.91]And by the way, on the other screen, I'm moving around.
[124:41.16]Blow the rope like Joe.
[124:42.66]And I'm moving around on the screen right now.
[124:44.52]You understand?
[124:50.98]He skipped my compliment.
[124:52.42]I did not skip your compliment.
[124:58.91]It's right in front of me.
[125:06.13]I wanted to read mine too.
[125:07.85]Well, I walked into a box accidentally there.
[125:13.32]Multitasking.
[125:14.56]I mean, that is what it is.
[125:15.71]It's just multitasking.
[125:24.91]I probably have to come back here at the hours between 12, 22, and 4, 45, or whatever.
[125:29.52]This is like the Futurama dog that just stands outside until I die and never come back.
[125:45.43]If I read every comment, what does this one say?
[125:47.15]That.
[125:55.02]Do I have a house here that I can buy?
[126:02.90]Spoilers.
[126:03.56]Spoilers for Futurama?
[126:05.48]Come on.
[126:07.54]Futurama.
[126:08.43]That doesn't count.
[126:11.13]Futurama came out in like 2001.
[126:14.95]Or whatever it was.
[126:16.31]Let's go to bed.
[126:27.91]Futurama spoilers.
[126:29.11]Idiot.
[126:29.67]Idiot.
[126:30.27]Idiot.
[126:32.39]Where did my house go?
[126:33.33]Oh, that was my house.
[126:39.50]Do I have to sleep on the piano?
[126:40.64]I don't understand.
[126:41.62]Oh.
[126:42.98]fucking twin bed John Marston come on a twin mattress what's with it all the twin mattresses where's my fucking deluxe King stop spoiling The Simpsons what's my favorite Simpsons episode The Simpsons is not good
[127:06.52]And I'm not going to be one of those people that says, well, you know, the first four seasons of The Simpsons... Oh, The Simpsons has always been bad.
[127:18.58]You know what the funniest Simpson joke that was like 20 years ago?
[127:22.30]Oh, like Homer strangles his son.
[127:26.41]Funny joke.
[127:32.03]Don't!
[127:32.57]I'm going to kill my son on camera.
[127:36.25]Like a good funny joke, Matt Groening.
[127:52.52]I'm just going to laugh about it a little bit, just slightly.
[127:56.26]I'm just going to slightly laugh about it a little bit, kind of a little bit right now.
[128:04.17]Of course I like The Simpsons.
[128:06.47]The first, like, two Treehouse of Horror episodes are some of my favorite TV.
[128:09.94]Of course the first, like, five years of The Simpsons was good.
[128:31.81]Not as far as I know.
[128:32.77]I was raised in an orphanage.
[128:35.85]My father was Scottish.
[128:37.13]Hmm, unfortunate.
[128:39.21]You'd make an interesting case for my theory of natural population characteristics.
[128:44.07]Really?
[128:44.59]Well, yes.
[128:45.49]A white man, obviously, but with a savage spirit.
[128:49.82]Trust me, sir, I mean savage in the best possible sense.
[128:51.94]Natural mobility, but also simple.
[128:54.68]Pure.
[128:56.02]I've been looking at some blood samples through my microscope, and you know what?
[129:02.17]No.
[129:04.15]The Simpsons meet Granger episode is like... I loved and was terrified of that episode.
[129:10.71]With Scoutmaster Willie.
[129:12.48]What's his name there?
[129:15.22]Janitor Willie.
[129:15.84]What's his name?
[129:16.66]He keeps dying.
[129:17.06]They keep burying an axe in him.
[129:18.76]It's classic.
[129:19.26]Classic Ben.
[129:31.80]They're eating people.
[129:33.02]Classic.
[129:33.42]That's season six, Treehouse.
[129:35.04]No, it isn't, is it?
[129:35.82]Looks good, whatever it was.
[130:01.69]I know we cannot see the stars but still my heart is pure and we meet as equals these savages must be spoken to simply in metaphors no sir I grew up on a reservation and attended school oh lovely can we like drown this guy what you want to see I know where the group of bandits just like goofy alton brown wannabe has attracted a following of young men on the reservation
[130:32.05]Looks like a nerd.
[130:32.55]He does, he looks like Alton Brown with a mustache.
[131:02.92]And I want to devour him in acid.
[131:07.64]He's dressed like Spongebob.
[131:11.52]Yeah, he is dressed like Spongebob.
[131:14.02]I wonder if he's going to go da-ah.
[131:15.66]Da-ah.
[131:15.78]Da-ah.
[131:15.90]What do you guys think?
[131:16.42]Do you guys think he's going to go da-ah?
[131:18.99]Da-ah.
[131:19.23]Da-ah.
[131:33.10]I do like Futurama more than The Simpsons, though.
[131:35.96]If I were to take the amount of laughs and the amount of enjoyment I got from Futurama's first few seasons...
[131:52.45]Although, like, Billy West, I think, is just, like, an extremely talented person.
[132:01.13]And, Jesus, did you see that fucking... Somebody shot that buffalo out of a gun.
[132:06.66]Somebody fucking gonzo degraded out of a cannon that buffalo.
[132:10.18]Have I ever watched King of the Hill?
[132:12.78]Yes.
[132:21.64]Mike Judge is... I don't think I've ever seen a show that Mike Judge had any involvement in that I didn't like.
[132:29.26]The Good Family was fucking terrible, let's be honest here.
[132:33.60]The Good Family was one of the worst shows ever.
[132:37.02]And that was a Mike Judge show, so I mean...
[132:45.48]Silicon Valley is probably my favorite show on TV right now.
[132:56.32]And that's my judge.
[132:58.46]I thought you were a brave cultural explorer.
[133:02.23]Good Lord, no.
[133:03.51]I rarely leave my room.
[133:05.23]I explore with the mind, Mr. Master.
[133:07.83]Enjoy it while you still can.
[133:09.89]Soon you will have cut down all of these trees.
[133:12.61]Bulletproof buffalo.
[133:13.50]Me?
[133:14.28]Or are you making a sweeping statement about the white man in general?
[133:17.80]There is no respect for the land anymore.
[133:22.15]Please shoot.
[133:22.73]This narrative is annoying.
[133:24.66]I told you I wanted to, like, dip Manassas.
[133:26.30]I want to dip this guy in dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[133:29.68]And have him just be like, Woo!
[133:34.32]Woo!
[133:36.90]Woo!
[133:38.44]Like the fucking Toons.
[133:46.27]Silicon Valley stresses you out.
[133:47.67]It's supposed to.
[134:00.28]That scene gave me nightmares.
[134:04.69]That movie gave me nightmares, but I think it's one of the best movies ever made.
[134:12.01]I would argue a bunch of different reasons why Who Framed Roger Rabbit is in the top five movies ever made of all time.
[134:21.78]People like to say, no, no, it's Citizen Kane.
[134:23.68]No, it's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[134:25.00]It just is.
[134:41.23]I'm gonna do 10 fingers here, okay.
[134:48.06]Can we talk about the game, please?
[134:50.60]I haven't made a reference to Red Dead Redemption or anything on the screen in like 47 minutes.
[135:09.98]It's also one of the first 2D animated drawn movies.
[135:14.18]From Disney a long time.
[135:15.40]Saved them from bankruptcy.
[135:16.75]Bankruptcy even.
[135:17.49]Well, that's... Yeah, I didn't know that.
[135:26.01]It is a very noir film.
[135:27.51]It is.
[135:27.63]Just the animation is so...
[135:41.91]Like, I can't even explain it.
[135:44.63]They don't do them like that anymore.
[135:49.23]That kind of style of... The term I want to use here is over-animated.
[135:54.82]Everyone tries to do shortcuts now.
[135:56.30]Everyone tries to find ways around doing actually, like, full drawn-out, like, over-animation.
[136:03.10]To the point where... Man, it's all 3D now, which, I mean, that's alright.
[136:07.18]It's not terrible.
[136:07.92]I don't, like, hate that, but...
[136:11.67]Compare 2D animated TV shows and movies now than what they were back in the 70s and 80s.
[136:21.26]It was completely like Tex Avery.
[136:24.84]I'll name drop for you.
[136:29.09]The era of Tex Avery and... I'm trying to think of one other example that I could give you.
[136:38.26]Well, what's the guy that inspired Cuphead?
[136:42.38]He's got a very, very specific name.
[136:47.18]Chuck Jones, that's another one.
[136:49.83]Tex Avery, Chuck Jones.
[136:51.15]There's one in particular that inspired Cuphead.
[136:55.99]It's an old, old, old, old, old.
[136:58.75]Jack Splicer, I think is what it is.
[137:00.03]Yeah, I think that somebody got it already.
[137:01.35]I was about to shoot the TNT for no reason.
[137:04.70]Max Fleischer.
[137:06.30]There it is.
[137:07.36]Did I say Sean Spicer?
[137:09.16]Oh yeah, Sean Spicer.
[137:12.56]I really like that.
[137:14.55]Max Fleischer.
[137:15.27]There it is.
[137:18.65]If you ever have, uh... Jim Davis.
[137:26.71]Shut up.
[137:29.17]Shut up.
[137:30.32]Stop saying Jim Davis.
[137:37.06]Sean Spicer.
[137:40.30]Jack Spicer.
[137:41.22]I love how we can just like fucking accidentally.
[137:43.99]Yeah.
[137:50.05]One of the reasons why The Mask is like one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies is because of it's like Tex Avery inspired animated sequence.
[138:02.98]What happened?
[138:03.60]I was reading chat.
[138:10.29]I'm not even playing the game.
[138:21.11]Where am I going?
[138:29.06]Wait, is he dead on the ground?
[138:30.62]Oh shit!
[138:39.30]We're okay.
[138:40.38]Everything's fine.
[138:41.22]That's so stupid.
[138:46.52]Like, you can tell just how much I'm not, like, even fucking paying attention to the video game.
[138:51.31]I'm, like, streaming.
[138:53.13]There's so much comedy here.
[138:55.17]They were talking comedy.
[138:57.31]playing a game on twitch.tv like a video game streaming website and I'm fucking not even playing I don't even like care we're talking about like cartoons animation and like tex avery garfield and like dude I'm not even playing a game oh fucking joke I'm hurt pretty bad
[139:22.10]Streamer reads book while playing Red Dead.
[139:25.03]It's just like a one-man podcast with this random game in the background.
[139:27.75]May as well not even be here.
[139:30.33]Ugh.
[139:43.30]Saddest part, this is actually... No, this is... Look, look.
[139:46.96]This is a very good game.
[139:48.70]I wouldn't be playing it as much as I did if I wasn't heavily enjoying myself.
[139:52.61]Was that guy just talking to me?
[140:02.24]This game holds up incredibly well.
[140:08.98]If I didn't know any better, I would say this is a game that came out
[140:13.52]Like, very recently, within the last couple of years.
[140:21.79]It holds up well.
[140:22.77]It's very fun.
[140:23.41]You heard I don't like Bazooka Joe.
[140:28.41]I guess my question to you is, why do you like Bazooka Joe?
[140:40.66]Hold on a minute.
[140:44.69]One second.
[140:53.63]Wait a minute.

[145:54.66]I need to close this.
[145:55.72]It's auto playing videos.
[145:57.02]Hold on a second.
[146:08.86]No, no, no, no, no.
[146:09.98]Ah, goddammit.
[146:25.10]Yeah, you can pretend to bite it.
[146:26.00]Just leave autoplay on.
[146:26.91]I can't even fucking pay attention to this goddamn game right now.
[146:30.35]Care and feeding and maintenance.
[146:48.98]I'm not doing enough multitasking to play the game, read, listen, perform magic.
[146:51.16]That was a big jump.
[146:52.29]Am I going the right way?
[147:17.48]Latex rubber tubing can be gotten at medical supply store sometimes called surgical tubing.
[147:23.06]I can't take it anymore.
[147:23.88]I have to turn it off.
[147:24.68]So it makes it, you know, very good for its springy characteristics and making the coin fold.
[147:30.68]Bring back the Garfield sensor.
[147:32.81]Inside diameter tubing.
[147:35.19]The outside diameter is three sixteenths inch, which allows two walls on either side to be one thirty second.
[147:40.73]That's it, Larry.
[147:41.63]You're out.
[147:42.15]Is there another pair?
[147:44.33]On the right side.
[147:46.48]There's another bear!
[147:48.22]What is it?
[147:48.48]It's like a fucking zombie!
[147:49.44]What is going on?
[147:50.62]It's a fucking cat!
[147:52.38]Why are there these animals here?
[147:55.16]What the fuck?
[147:58.22]Jesus!
[148:06.89]Oh my god!
[148:23.67]It was Garfield, and I shot him right in the face.
[148:27.18]He killed Garfield.
[148:28.44]Let's make this quick.
[148:31.09]Why are there mountain lions in the mountains?
[148:32.67]Why are there mountain bears in the Martins?
[148:35.14]George R. R. Martin presents A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1, A Clash of Kings.
[148:41.22]Except that's actually Book 3.
[148:43.12]Why am I turning into Robin Williams?
[148:45.48]Just hang on, let me tell you something.
[148:46.59]We're going to say this now.
[148:47.19]We're going to talk about this.
[148:47.83]We're going to go here.
[148:48.29]This is so far to go.
[148:56.77]Did you guys hear that?
[148:58.60]Speaking of animals...
[149:00.62]I hope you can hear that.
[149:03.86]There's like a coyote outside the window.
[149:05.92]Going like... Do you hear this?
[149:48.48]Let's go.
[149:57.24]Book five of Dance of Dragons.
[150:01.08]Read for you by Roy Dutrice.
[150:06.14]The best part about Roy Dutrice reading those audiobooks for A Song of Ice and Fire was when he did Daenerys' voice.
[150:12.44]And he would just look like this and say, this is supposed to be Daenerys Targaryen.
[150:17.31]It was amazing.
[150:18.33]If you ever have a chance, if you want to know, if you really sincerely want to get into, like, Game of Thrones or read, just have Roy, get the audiobooks and have Roy do a trace read it to you.
[150:30.28]It makes it so much better.
[150:49.81]I don't want to redo this!
[150:56.40]What?!
[151:02.95]Oh, thank god.
[151:27.65]He was looking at me.
[151:38.86]There he is.
[151:43.64]He looked directly at me for a solid three seconds.
[151:49.16]That was perfect.
[151:49.92]Hey!
[151:52.59]What?
[151:55.47]Did I just lose?
[151:58.56]Am I acting right now?
[152:00.55]Does he know that was me?
[152:05.01]What is going on right now?
[152:09.59]Mr. Marston.
[152:10.55]Oh.
[152:11.79]Mr. Marston.
[152:13.07]I guess that was supposed to happen.
[152:14.37]Mr. Marston.
[152:15.67]Okay.
[152:19.52]Here you go, Mr. Marston.
[152:22.22]Hey, base scoop, thanks for the $15.
[152:23.42]Am I still friends with Bazooka Joe?
[152:26.26]I used to read Bazooka Joe all the time.
[152:28.18]You can't be friends with a cartoon character, though.
[152:32.67]He's not real.
[152:42.07]Also, cigarette spaghetti, thanks for the five bucks.
[152:43.95]I had to get more bits for that fucking explosion from earlier.
[152:46.81]Thanks, dude.
[152:47.51]Also, thanks to For Real Dough and Combine.
[152:49.52]And, uh, Party Crabs.
[152:59.61]Thanks, guys, for the bits.
[153:00.47]You guys rock.
[153:00.81]I gotta pee.
[153:01.09]I think I can get back before this keeps going.
[153:02.67]Alright, I'm gonna pee.
[153:22.03]Enjoy the cutscene while I pee.
[153:23.49]Never mind, like, I'm out of the cutscene.
[153:25.45]I might as well put the BRB screen up.
[153:27.57]Savage soul.
[153:27.89]Alright, tea break.
[153:28.61]We'll be back in a minute.
[153:50.83]Go take a little break.
[153:51.82]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[157:38.67]I got so much crap here.
[157:42.85]I'm just gonna remove it.
[157:43.90]I got a lot of random images of fucking Garfield.
[157:46.22]Let me just get rid of these.
[157:55.93]Are we doing another one of these shush guys, don't tell them?
[157:58.91]Are we doing one of these again?
[158:01.43]Don't tell them, guys.
[158:02.37]Be quiet.
[158:03.07]Shush.
[158:03.59]Don't say.
[158:04.19]Don't tell them.
[158:11.64]Hey, don't tell me what.

[158:16.68]Should I go get a haircut?
[158:21.75]Yeah.

[158:34.22]Don't tell them his fly is down while my... I thought someone was riding my own horse.
[158:40.25]Let's go get a haircut.
[158:50.83]A shopkeeper has been killed.
[158:52.31]The shop is now unavailable for five days.
[158:58.07]Laundry?
[158:58.69]It's a laundry service?
[159:04.60]What happened?
[159:07.18]What the fuck is going on here?
[159:10.58]What happened?
[159:11.26]What?
[159:11.74]What happened?
[159:23.98]Why is this happening right now?
[159:32.20]I'm going to be... That's 50 bucks?
[159:42.21]I don't know what to tell you guys, but apparently taking money from a guy's safe is more important than murdering people.
[159:54.45]That guy don't care.
[159:55.25]I mean, I took $18.
[159:55.87]Here he comes.
[160:01.18]I don't fucking care.

[161:08.12]Can I make it?

[163:35.10]Wait, don't do it.
[163:35.64]You won't be able to get the funny costumes.
[163:43.32]Blackjack.
[163:45.20]That's not Blackjack.
[163:47.24]That's very far from Blackjack.
[163:49.97]Seven.

[165:42.28]God damn it.
[165:43.08]A fucking seventeen.
[165:55.27]This is why gambling is dumb.
[165:59.35]Because it doesn't matter.
[166:02.17]This is why people lose fucking $50,000 a year at a casino.
[166:15.09]Because one guy will win like fucking $200 at the casino and everybody else will lose $5,000.
[166:25.75]Now I wish I had the fucking money for the funny costumes.
[166:36.54]Kill them and get your money back?
[166:37.89]You know, I actually really might just throw a fucking grenade in there.
[166:41.87]That was bullshit.
[166:42.69]I lost like fucking six hands in a row.
[166:47.03]How much money do I have?
[166:55.33]Now he's thinking.
[166:56.05]It's like squeeze down this alley.
[167:05.70]I want my haircut too.
[167:12.55]Give me my haircut.
[167:15.11]Can I get in this way?
[167:18.13]Can't get in this way.
[167:19.63]Great.
[167:26.79]I just saw Otto.
[167:27.61]Otto is upstairs eating food right now.
[167:30.49]He's eating dinner.
[167:33.24]Fucking just trampled this guy.
[167:39.02]Okay, here we go.
[167:43.46]Let's go.
[167:43.90]Fine.
[167:45.74]Maybe I can win some money back.
[167:48.74]Come on then.

[168:24.07]Thanks.
[168:27.41]Any money in this?
[168:33.49]No money.
[168:35.71]And now all the stores are closed.
[168:37.87]Come on.
[168:38.41]Don't do this shit to me.
[168:43.95]Now all the stores are closed?
[168:46.63]What was the point of that?
[168:58.48]Not worth it.
[168:59.10]I got 50 fame points.
[169:03.32]Who cares?
[169:03.92]I might just rob the bank.
[169:08.18]That's not a bad idea.
[169:08.98]I might just be an outlaw.
[169:25.12]Let's go take a nap.
[169:30.66]What is happening?
[169:32.56]I can't get in that way?
[169:33.48]Looks like a lucky table.
[169:53.85]Damn it!
[169:54.41]I thought there was going to be blackjack.
[169:56.53]What does he have, a four?
[169:59.76]I'm safe regardless.
[170:01.84]I'm going to hit.

[171:26.88]Well, thanks a lot.
[171:28.48]Thank you, lesser organisms.
[171:31.88]That was like five or six years ago.
[171:35.37]That was like six plus years ago at this point.
[171:40.47]I do remember Lepter.
[171:42.85]I do remember that person.
[171:48.85]I hope they're doing well.
[171:51.74]Wherever they are in life, hope you're doing well too.
[171:57.57]I do remember playing Minecraft.
[172:00.53]I remember playing Minecraft.
[172:01.33]There was like two of the people that we used to play with sometimes.
[172:09.11]Holy shit, you have Minecraft videos?
[172:10.77]Oh, I got Minecraft videos.
[172:14.18]Like 16 of them in total.
[172:19.55]I have to go to bed again.
[172:20.76]How did I go to sleep and wake up at night?
[172:22.28]Did I sleep for like 24 hours?
[172:23.82]What the fuck?
[172:26.74]Uh, yeah, my Minecraft videos aren't like Minecraft videos you probably ever watch.
[172:30.72]They were just awful.
[172:32.78]They were just fucking awful.
[172:42.81]Uh, cigarette spaghetti, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[172:44.41]20 dollars?
[172:48.44]That last donation was really touching, and I'm glad you remember that Minecraft collab.
[172:52.61]However, the purpose of this donation is to promote my upcoming Garfield X Auto... Okay.
[173:00.15]Okay.
[173:01.27]Well, that's what we're gonna... We're gonna nip that one in the butt.
[173:04.03]But thank you, Cigarette, for the 20 bucks.
[173:13.69]Watch JermaCraft on stream.
[173:15.25]No, I... It'll hurt me.
[173:19.23]It will actually cause injury.
[173:20.93]It will injure me.
[173:21.47]Alright, now let me go to the gunsmith.
[173:37.92]This game probably has the hardest controls of any Rockstar game.
[173:43.08]It is a little... It can be a little on the wonky side, I will agree.
[173:49.57]I don't think they're bad, but they can be a little sloppy.
[173:54.90]Where is the gunsmith?
[173:57.52]Oh, right here.
[174:13.04]Okay, now let's please go to the tailor.
[174:20.25]No, this is the designated spot where idiots stand to get you in a duel.
[174:26.09]No, replace you with one random fucking guy every time I wake up.
[174:29.69]No.
[174:31.39]Not gonna happen.
[174:35.40]Another guy wants to duel me.
[174:36.64]Where?
[174:37.12]The fucking shopkeeper.
[174:38.64]The shopkeeper wants to fight me.
[174:43.78]Really?
[174:45.10]The tailor wants to shoot me.
[174:51.63]Who is this?
[174:55.98]No, I don't... No.
[175:01.42]Nope.
[175:05.68]U.S.
[175:05.90]military scrap.
[175:07.30]I don't have anything.
[175:09.02]He doesn't have anything, okay.
[175:09.92]It's the guy from fucking 100 meters away.
[175:14.90]Of course.
[175:29.32]He's right there, right?
[175:30.30]He's not going to move, right?
[175:51.52]What the fuck is he?
[175:53.60]Is he crouching?
[175:54.34]No.
[176:00.27]He's looking over at me.
[176:13.15]Fuck.
[176:18.22]Okay.
[176:18.86]Oh, we tried.
[176:20.06]We tried it.
[176:23.00]How would he see me?
[176:28.20]I'm fucking sniping him from across town.
[176:31.28]And he points like James Bond.
[176:33.08]He did like the... There he is.
[176:37.66]Alright, arrest this man.
[176:43.12]Do you see what he's doing?
[176:44.28]He's shooting his gun.
[176:45.20]Fucking put him in cuffs.
[176:50.17]Do your job.
[176:53.03]You fucking weird English Bobby.
[176:54.73]Like, grab this guy.
[176:58.76]Alright, fine.
[177:01.00]I'll take Madison into my own hands.
[177:03.04]Alright, here we go.
[177:03.44]I'm gonna do it again.
[177:07.52]Wait a minute.
[177:07.86]I have an idea.
[177:13.70]Come on, I can't, like, herd this guy like a sheep.
[177:15.97]Howdy!
[177:33.75]Come with me.
[177:43.89]Where did his gun go?
[177:45.17]Doesn't this guy have a gun?
[177:55.23]Don't you ever fucking embarrass me again.
[177:57.39]Hey, why don't we give you a dip in the fucking lake?
[178:03.46]Why don't we dip him in the lake?
[178:06.14]Oh no, you can't go in one... Alright, I'm... I can't even like do the thing I wanted to do.
[178:21.69]This guy pulls his gun out and shoots it at me.
[178:23.91]Nobody does anything.
[178:26.09]I tie him to a horse and drag him for five feet and all of a sudden I'm like a wanted criminal!
[178:31.02]Kill him as soon as possible!
[178:35.34]Play the game?
[178:36.48]I am playing the game.
[178:38.92]It's an open world sandbox game.
[178:40.54]I don't have to do the missions.
[178:42.83]I can fucking tie people up if I want.
[178:49.69]Let's go.
[178:54.13]Hey, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the five dollars.
[178:55.70]More like Garfield.
[178:56.72]Nope.
[179:00.72]Thank you, Moo, for the five dollars.
[179:03.47]Appreciate it.
[179:04.45]You never went to the gun shop?
[179:05.72]Did I unlock something?
[179:28.45]He kind of does look like a zombie.
[179:31.27]He has that zombified look to his face.
[179:33.77]SpongeBob Thornberry.
[179:54.35]Undead Nightmare.
[179:56.43]How long is the Undead Nightmare campaign?
[180:00.51]Is Undead Nightmare more than like one stream?
[180:07.84]I thought he just got run over.
[180:20.74]Is that his horse?
[180:22.44]That can't be his horse.
[180:23.30]What are we... Is this mine?
[180:25.48]Oh, that is mine.
[180:26.12]Okay, that was weird.
[180:26.78]Uh...
[180:48.47]I broke the law.
[180:49.67]I don't know.
[180:51.07]I guess I broke the law.
[180:51.95]I don't know what happened.
[180:54.45]I broke the law.
[180:55.17]Don't you dare ride down that street.
[180:56.60]Okay, let's try this again.
[181:13.75]Let's slash follow this dude.
[181:15.17]Undead Nightmare is like six to eight hours.
[181:17.72]Maybe.
[181:18.08]I mean, there's a couple of things I want to do.
[181:21.34]I want to play the new Edmund McMillan game.
[181:23.56]Edmund McMillan.
[181:24.32]It's hard to say that word sometimes.
[181:26.50]The End is Nigh.
[181:27.14]I wanted to stream that.
[181:45.51]Didn't he just made another super meat boy, right?
[181:48.25]That's not super meat boy?
[181:48.89]I caught that.
[181:49.63]I was like, hey, that sounds like fun.
[181:50.73]Essentially, yes.
[182:10.29]That's basically what it is.
[182:11.69]End is nigh is amazing.
[182:12.88]It's very excellent.
[182:13.70]That's good.
[182:14.38]Maybe we'll do another bear.
[182:35.89]Oh, you might want to back away from the bear.
[182:37.69]He just fucking... He just seriously did a melee attack to the bear.
[182:41.79]Well, why?
[182:45.46]I want to skin this bear.
[182:51.16]What is he doing?
[182:58.94]Pistol whipping the bear.
[183:10.82]Where is he?
[183:18.16]The random, like... No, there he is.
[183:20.00]I was gonna say he took off.
[183:20.98]More random horses.
[183:22.54]That bear showed no signs of aggression.
[183:25.54]If we hadn't shot first, it most likely would have ignored us and moved on.
[183:30.65]All very well for you to say that perhaps you have some kind of primal bond with these animals, but I, sir, have nothing but my innate instinct for self-preservation.
[183:42.75]Okay.
[183:43.97]There's another bear?
[183:45.13]No, that was... That was a buffalo.
[183:48.17]Oh, that was a bison.
[183:56.07]Go to the cabin.
[183:58.64]Say hello.
[184:01.02]Watch out for the hyenas.
[184:01.92]Are those pigs?
[184:04.06]Those are warthogs.
[184:04.86]Alright.
[184:17.52]Now what?
[184:18.54]Hello, gentlemen.
[184:20.18]We come in peace.
[184:22.35]Those words mean nothing coming from people like you.
[184:25.77]Look at what you've done to us.
[184:27.05]Look at us!
[184:28.65]We live like animals, scrabbling in the dirt.
[184:31.41]This guy looks like the SpongeBob guy.
[184:33.21]Looks like he's wearing somebody else's skin and a fake mustache.
[184:35.85]Silence isn't the answer!
[184:37.00]Maybe you live in a different America than we.
[184:39.84]Men like Vanderlint will lead you to disaster.
[184:42.50]I think we've already experienced disaster.
[184:45.36]The likes which you could only imagine.
[184:48.66]Oh, he's dual welding.
[184:49.70]He's fucking dual welding.
[184:51.90]Whoa, what?
[184:52.30]What the fuck?
[184:52.78]Why couldn't they have shot that guy?
[184:55.56]I missed it.
[185:29.82]This is a nightmare.
[185:30.44]This is an undead nightmare.
[185:38.22]One, two.
[185:39.60]Ooh, that hurt.
[185:40.44]That hurt a lot, apparently.
[185:41.48]Okay, what did he have?
[185:46.84]He had six dollars.
[186:02.59]Alright, let's see.
[186:04.07]I felt like I was carrying six bucks.
[186:21.14]Found a dollar.
[186:21.94]Alright, now give me some more dialog, sir.
[186:27.73]I'd love it.
[186:41.56]That guy wasn't dead.
[186:46.22]That's odd.
[186:46.72]Grandma doesn't read.
[186:57.56]Doesn't read what?
[186:59.02]Here they come.
[186:59.94]They're gonna come up behind us.
[187:20.73]Get out of the way horses That guy's getting dragged It's up only because of spoilers Wait, we were doing spoiler chat?
[187:40.97]What's up with that?
[187:43.95]No spoilers
[187:55.93]No!
[188:01.96]One person thought he was funny.
[188:09.38]Well, we can't have spoilers.
[188:12.72]I've never played this game before, come on.
[188:19.73]Why are we moving so slow?
[188:26.25]This seems like a very awkward, strange, roundabout way to go where we're going.
[188:37.01]Alright.
[188:39.79]Submode for spoilers, but not Garfield porn.
[188:43.63]There was no... Garfield...
[188:56.09]Okay.
[189:01.41]Let's take a look at that gun shop, shall we?
[189:10.16]Through here.
[189:11.26]What do you got?
[189:11.70]I got some money.
[189:14.54]Get the clown costume.
[189:16.88]Uh, no.
[189:17.41]Uh, we got the mouser.
[189:22.55]Car can.
[189:23.87]Who's holding down a horn?
[189:29.37]Mauser pistol?
[189:32.87]Or Carcano rifle?
[189:37.17]What do you think?
[189:39.68]I'm going to say Mauser.
[189:43.82]Sounds like the best option.
[189:46.08]I got the money, might as well just buy it.
[189:53.35]I'm getting both.
[189:58.63]What does it use for ammo?
[190:00.77]Pistol ammo?
[190:03.47]Mauser pistol!
[190:06.65]No- NDA!
[190:08.55]We're good.
[190:13.93]I got enough ammo, I'm fine.
[190:15.73]I'm gonna give it a try.
[190:20.03]Spoiler.
[190:22.19]Garfield gets the lasagna.
[190:27.02]Help, help, help, help, help!
[190:28.18]Okay.
[190:28.92]Help with what?
[190:32.80]Oh, if there's money involved, you better believe it.
[190:34.68]Because you ain't getting it back.
[190:42.19]Excuse me, sir.
[190:43.65]There's free money over there.
[190:56.11]Wait, he's got a gun!
[191:02.12]I was trying to do something fucking stupid.
[191:04.74]And it got me killed.
[191:05.86]I was trying to make a fucking stupid thing.
[191:08.46]Oh my god.
[191:12.17]I was trying to do something fun.
[191:27.29]And it didn't work.
[191:28.95]I got instantly killed.
[191:32.38]Let's just do the goddamn mission.
[191:36.85]Where's my cigar?
[191:46.09]It wasn't even going to be funny.
[191:47.57]I was just going to try something.
[191:48.75]Because I ran him over and I wanted to see what was going to happen.
[191:51.51]It didn't even matter what I was going to try to do.
[191:53.58]Because I instantly died.
[191:56.40]In one and a half seconds.
[191:59.54]How is it not the right time for this?
[192:03.96]I don't get that.
[192:27.23]Rockstar, just paint over these doors with the brick acid.
[192:31.21]Please.
[192:35.22]Just use the paint tool and paint brick over that.
[192:37.56]Come on.
[192:40.06]Get the fuck out of my room.
[192:41.16]What are you doing in my room?
[192:41.96]Are you, like, playing the piano in my room?
[192:46.90]Fuck off.
[192:50.04]Make sure you don't have a, quote, accident going down the stairs.
[192:52.52]Fucking piece of crap.
[193:00.59]Out of my room.
[193:08.45]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $5.
[193:09.33]Please tell Otto I'm sorry for my inappropriate comment earlier.
[193:13.47]His lasagna is too pure for Garfield.
[193:17.03]Would I consider playing Oxenfree on a chill Friday stream?
[193:22.71]It's got really great atmosphere from the time I've spent with it.
[193:28.54]Yeah, I don't even know what it is.
[193:32.34]I don't know what it is.
[193:33.10]Is it like a horror game or something?
[193:40.67]Okay, is it good time now?
[193:51.49]It's not 6 p.m.
[193:52.44]and 5 a.m.
[193:53.36]Like, come on.
[193:54.36]I thought it was... This is like... Come on.
[194:06.52]I thought it was going to be the right time.
[194:07.96]Apparently not.
[194:17.85]I wish I could just wake up.
[194:19.11]Didn't it have alarm clocks back then?
[194:27.42]Why can't I set my alarm for 7 o'clock?
[194:29.64]Alright, it's dark out.
[194:36.22]What are you doing on there?
[194:37.34]There we go.
[194:54.12]Between 6 p.m.
[194:54.96]and 5 a.m.
[194:56.02]That's an odd time.
[195:05.11]Hey, boneless bacon, thanks for the bits.
[195:08.87]Spoiler alert, next mission you shoot someone.
[195:13.22]Kappa!
[195:14.82]There was a Kappa in that message.
[195:16.60]Crap!
[195:17.46]Has somebody made that yet?
[195:18.96]It's like a shit emoji, but with Jason Kappa's face, whatever his name is.
[195:36.50]I'm sure somebody has it somewhere.
[195:39.25]I think we all are.
[195:40.41]Not me, sir.
[195:41.55]I'm from Connecticut.
[195:43.03]I'm a professor at Yale.
[195:43.97]I write books.
[195:44.95]I do not deserve to die out here.
[195:46.99]Where's my tincture?
[195:50.98]Oh, yes.
[195:52.36]Thank you, Chuff, for the bits.
[195:55.50]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[195:58.60]So he was on drugs the whole time.
[195:59.82]You okay, Professor?
[196:02.13]Dandy, sir.
[196:05.21]So he's just doing drugs.
[196:09.73]Is that you, John?
[196:11.39]Hello, Dutch.
[196:13.49]It's this guy again.
[196:16.32]I think that's what they call two for the price of one out here in this wonderful place.
[196:23.20]Maybe so, Dutch.
[196:24.28]You just realized that.
[196:25.56]You and your friend there, the professor?
[196:29.82]We're going to kill the both of you.
[196:32.78]Why do you want to do a thing like that?
[196:36.06]I don't know.
[196:37.49]Sport, I guess.
[196:40.67]Fair enough.
[196:43.35]Why don't I come out there?
[196:45.35]We fight.
[196:47.11]Let the professor go and send your boys back to their families.
[196:51.30]Well, that sounds like a beautiful plan, John.
[196:55.18]Only problem is, my boys here, they already lost their families a long time ago.
[197:03.11]We aren't thieves, John.
[197:06.29]We're fighting for something a bit like you, only we're fighting for an idea, not just for ourselves.
[197:15.95]That's beautiful, Dutch.
[197:18.39]You always were a fine speaker.
[197:20.78]I was.
[197:22.42]How would you kindly send that academic out here so we can show him what we really think about the art of anthropology?
[197:33.82]That line was hard.
[197:34.82]That was a hard... He was supposed to scream that line and he got caught up in that scream.
[197:39.99]That's happened to me a few times.
[197:43.21]Probably to you as well.
[197:45.13]Sometimes you try to scream something and you're like... Your voice grabs a hold of you.
[197:50.75]Your cords collapse.
[197:53.84]That's happened to me.
[197:56.92]What the fuck?
[197:59.70]Oh shit.
[198:01.47]My sensor bar is not ready.
[198:02.55]No sensor bar.
[198:04.17]Just talked over a really good line.
[198:07.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[198:23.65]Alright, I think I'll drop the sub only.
[198:28.05]Ow.
[198:28.41]That was a good Dark Souls ladder climb.
[198:33.96]I've done that.
[198:34.42]You go up, you go down, you go up, you go down.
[198:38.34]Free them.
[198:39.96]What?
[198:40.40]What the fuck?
[198:41.94]Didn't he just walk up the stairs?
[198:53.87]It's odd.
[198:58.11]You want me to snipe?
[199:00.33]Sure.
[199:03.06]I feel like I don't even want the sniper rifle for this.
[199:09.78]That guy's alive.
[199:13.88]No, he's not.
[199:19.88]Is he in the window?
[199:20.82]No, he's dead.
[199:30.50]One here.
[199:39.93]On the leg.
[199:40.49]See you later.
[199:42.47]Last guy.
[199:43.33]Show yourself.
[199:44.09]And... Whoa!
[199:45.27]You got sneaky there.
[199:47.77]He's dead.
[199:48.13]Mm-hmm.
[199:59.84]How you doing?
[200:01.88]I'm going to put out the mouser.
[200:11.37]Where is it?
[200:14.35]What?
[200:20.11]Um.
[200:22.93]What the hell is that?
[200:26.31]The horses should be in an alleyway.
[200:29.43]Did I not?
[200:30.12]Did the game... I don't... What's... What happened?
[200:33.86]Can I get on the horse from up here?
[200:37.84]That'd be so fucking cool if I could.
[200:39.22]Right?
[200:39.40]I can do like a... Can't... Is this gonna kill me or can I... Don't even fucking try.
[200:42.94]Just fucking complete the mission.
[200:44.59]Didn't even fucking matter.
[200:48.55]Okay.
[200:56.63]Let's go, McDougal.
[201:05.81]So when I bought the Mauser, did I not?
[201:07.77]Did I do something stupid and the game didn't save?
[201:10.81]I thought it saved after I walked out.
[201:21.33]Wait, why are we back in step only?
[201:24.40]What happened?
[201:24.84]Something else happened?
[201:30.10]It turned off and it turned right back on?
[201:32.24]What happened?
[201:38.74]Oh, come on.
[201:39.72]Really?
[201:41.24]Why?
[201:41.54]And I have a sniper rifle equipped.
[201:48.41]This is fucking fantastic.
[201:50.63]Like, that's... I'm like... Why was the sniper rifle out?
[201:57.27]I didn't have it out.
[201:59.51]I had the fucking high-powered pistol.
[202:00.98]That was the last gun I had.
[202:07.13]Alright, take it off sub only and turn off the two minute slow mode.
[202:13.09]I command it.
[202:16.40]I command it.
[202:17.38]This really couldn't have gone more horribly wrong.
[202:21.44]Emote sub only, 110 seconds slow.
[202:24.48]You know, I dreamt of documenting the last days of the old west, the romance.
[202:29.72]Look, it's on again.
[202:31.32]It's auto-equipped again.
[202:32.20]Why?
[202:32.28]Freedom.
[202:32.44]Alright, here we go.
[202:55.35]I got the guy in the hand, this guy in the head.
[202:56.83]This guy, this like, bang bang bang.
[202:59.37]Much better.
[203:02.55]We're good.
[203:04.55]Some mods.
[203:05.17]Tear down this wall.
[203:26.96]No, it's alright.
[203:28.96]Don't worry.
[203:29.56]No one's going to spoil shit.
[203:32.69]Because if they do... Strike three.
[203:36.77]They're going to run into each other.
[203:43.19]Kind of wanted to see what was going to happen there, but it's okay.
[203:51.05]I would get banned from Counter-Strike if I did stuff like that.
[204:03.41]Toilet Jerma sucks.
[204:12.02]We're about to get on the train?
[204:18.64]I didn't, okay, I didn't do that.
[204:20.42]I very clearly did not do that.
[204:23.27]Good.
[204:23.65]And I apologize and we're okay.
[204:28.53]That was my horse.
[204:29.33]Wanted to go get hitched.
[204:31.41]Thanks a lot, Joff.
[204:32.11]For the bits.
[204:32.69]Best of luck, dear friend.
[204:58.17]You never see somebody get run over that slowly.
[205:01.35]So we're finally done with this guy?
[205:04.14]We're done with this guy forever, right?
[205:14.34]100 bucks, that's good.
[205:19.45]Alright.
[205:22.99]Let's go to... Let's just get rid of this bounty.
[205:26.17]Do I have a thing?
[205:27.09]Do I have a pardon?
[205:33.14]Well, there's nobody in here.
[205:34.28]So, never mind.
[205:38.54]We only got... They're fucking taunting me with this.
[205:54.61]It's only 40 bucks.
[205:55.41]Just pay it off.
[206:05.95]That was way more than $40.
[206:07.23]Okay.
[206:09.93]Where is this five-fingered thing?
[206:13.85]It's here to taunt me.
[206:16.18]Look at these awful GPS directions, by the way.
[206:20.76]This is GPS.
[206:25.32]Very realistic.
[206:27.86]I have to.
[206:28.20]They're taunting me.
[206:38.99]What did you say?
[206:39.71]Sure.
[206:40.65]You and me.
[206:46.53]How did we start when you put your money down?
[206:48.54]I'm betting a dollar.
[206:49.24]Hope you know what you're doing.
[206:57.36]That qualifies as a gash.
[206:59.62]What a waste.
[207:04.85]It's an A every time.
[207:07.73]Hold on, hold on.
[207:12.21]It's just A?
[207:16.44]What?
[207:18.94]It's just A. I'm pressing A. Oh, yeah.
[207:29.16]I'll take that $1.
[207:30.08]Didn't think I was going to be able to do that, did you?
[207:36.01]Oh, no.
[207:36.55]Wait a minute.
[207:37.63]That's it.
[207:37.95]I win.
[207:38.35]I can leave.
[207:38.93]No.
[207:41.21]See you later.
[207:42.65]That was fun.
[207:44.23]I finally got the better of it.
[207:48.89]I win.
[208:02.92]And after I win, you better believe no one else is gonna see the light of fuckin' day.
[208:13.21]Wait!
[208:17.63]Wait, how did I- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[208:21.62]How did I get- I'm so confused.
[208:25.00]I got hit by that.
[208:39.99]No witnesses.
[208:42.51]Oh, no witnesses.
[208:52.21]Wait, was that the train conductor?
[208:53.33]Who was that?
[208:55.39]Oh, come on!
[208:56.81]What is this?
[209:00.84]Where is this guy going?
[209:01.68]We're done.
[209:05.56]No more witnesses.
[209:10.85]Oh my god.
[209:16.13]What the fuck?
[209:18.65]Stop it.
[209:19.83]Stop it.
[209:20.81]Stop it.
[209:22.53]No more witnesses.
[209:23.59]I ran into the barrel of my gun.
[209:29.20]Jesus Christ.
[209:30.58]Okay, we're done.
[209:33.74]No bounty.
[209:34.66]No gold, no future.
[209:40.96]I didn't have a chance to even react to what just happened there.
[209:42.97]So I threw dynamite.
[209:45.33]It teleported me on top of the dynamite.
[209:47.89]I threw the dynamite and ran forward apparently.
[209:49.93]I'm going to have to watch that clip again at some point because that doesn't make any fucking sense.
[210:01.91]Let's go.
[210:02.89]Where do I have to go?
[210:06.30]Gee, I'll just ride.
[210:07.72]We'll take a ride.
[210:08.60]I haven't actually been on the horse.
[210:11.04]That didn't happen at all.
[210:11.88]What are you talking about?
[210:14.47]I threw that into the camp.
[210:27.63]Holy shit.
[210:30.35]That guy was on a slip and slide.
[210:39.80]It's gonna be like in that fucking movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming out of the Oh, what a funny XD moment
[211:27.62]Hey, what's up?
[211:30.18]Oh, it was a robbery.
[211:31.92]It was a robbery.
[211:32.64]Okay, sure.
[211:39.29]Didn't expect this, did ya?
[211:46.61]Okay.
[212:05.11]Fuck all of you.
[212:08.19]Whoa, wait, hold on.
[212:09.43]I want to loot the bodies.
[212:14.58]They all screamed the same exact audio clip at the same time, by the way.
[212:17.54]That was great.
[212:23.86]Plus 50 fame.
[212:25.03]So I did the right thing?
[212:26.37]This is an easy 50 fame.
[212:37.01]Do I know what's going on in the story?
[212:39.03]Of course I do.
[212:43.01]John Marston is a... Ex-con man.
[212:51.17]No, like, he's a... He was a bad guy.
[212:55.42]And he did some things that he wasn't, like, necessarily that proud of.
[213:00.90]No, I know what's going on.
[213:08.34]I mean, I believe the game starts in 1900, 1911, something like that.
[213:18.38]I'm a former outlaw, I know that.
[213:21.88]The FBI takes me from my family and shit.
[213:25.66]I know what's going on.
[213:28.26]I'll be given amnesty if I bring the people that were in my gang back to justice.
[213:39.65]What am I doing?
[213:58.02]Why did that guy stop, by the way?
[214:07.44]The one guy that I threw the dynamite at stopped in the middle of the road.
[214:11.42]For some reason.
[214:12.00]I think that was the good deed.
[214:16.86]I'm way too honorable anyways.
[214:19.08]My honor is like plus like 60.
[214:20.31]Or like plus like 75, 100 or something.
[214:23.09]Howdy there!
[214:35.47]How are you, mister?
[214:39.07]Uh, 7 a.m.
[214:39.56]and 10 p.m.
[214:40.50]I gotta come back in the day.
[214:42.56]Okay.
[214:46.96]Oh, yeah.
[214:47.18]I missed a freak.
[214:47.68]You're right.
[214:48.38]I did miss a freak.
[214:49.04]Let's go check it out.
[214:54.42]We got a freak!
[215:01.96]Oh, help, help.
[215:02.54]Anyone.
[215:04.39]Thief, right?
[215:11.40]I got another person to care about.
[215:14.95]Well, now I do care about him.
[215:16.59]Because I can't even go in any of these buildings.
[215:23.09]Honor lets you get away with crimes pretty much with anything.
[215:25.69]Anything that's not murder, pretty much.
[215:27.40]Oh, okay.
[215:31.60]Who has the horse?
[215:34.06]This guy?
[215:46.55]You're in trouble.
[215:49.86]Lasso or get on the horse.
[216:01.11]Okay.
[216:01.55]Well, he ran to the... He's dead.
[216:04.37]He ran into the water.
[216:12.38]Okay.
[216:12.90]Well, that... That's swell.
[216:19.04]Water strikes again.
[216:20.04]I'm just... Why is everybody freaking out?
[216:27.12]I'm just playing like... This is the equivalent of me playing with a yo-yo.
[216:31.24]And everybody's freaking out.
[216:36.06]Look out in the middle of town!
[216:37.18]There's a guy playing with a yo-yo!
[216:39.24]Kill him!
[216:41.34]There's a $5 bounty on this guy's head now!
[216:48.51]How do I just pay the five dollars?
[216:49.83]How do I do it?
[216:50.33]That was some Scooby Doo shit right there.
[216:58.99]Alright, come here, come here, come here.
[217:00.89]I'd like to pay my bounty, please.
[217:08.42]Fucking break.
[217:09.02]Five dollars, dead or alive.
[217:13.86]Pull this guy in.
[217:16.66]He was seen.
[217:17.32]He was last seen in the center of town jumping rope like a child.
[217:23.14]Murder him.
[217:31.70]I'm fine.
[217:32.10]I'm just gonna sit here.
[217:40.30]Five dollars was a lot back then.
[217:44.07]I mean, so... Give me a fucking break.
[217:48.77]For a five dollar bounty.
[217:49.91]Why is the circle this big for five bucks?
[217:51.63]At least it'll be time to go to the mission.
[218:03.62]Right?
[218:03.86]I hope so.
[218:18.19]Don't, please!
[218:19.13]Ugh.
[218:25.95]Alright, we're gonna do this last mission here for G. And then I'm gonna call it a evening for tonight's extra stream.
[218:40.46]So for those of you that have beat this game multiple times or whatever, like,
[218:45.71]Do you think that we'll finish this game tomorrow?
[218:48.86]Do you think that I will get to the end of Red Dead Redemption tomorrow?
[218:53.02]7 a.m.
[218:53.28]and 10 p.m.
[218:53.84]Well, what fucking time is it right now?
[218:57.62]Oh.
[218:58.20]Okay.
[219:05.07]There's only like three missions left.
[219:06.29]Really?
[219:10.29]Really.
[219:13.50]If you don't goof off too much, I could do it in about three or four hours.
[219:19.82]Okay.
[219:33.13]But since you didn't, where's my family?
[219:36.37]Spare me the noble savage fault.
[219:38.77]Okay.
[219:39.24]Getting there, but not quite done in a few hours or so.
[219:41.40]Alright, well, we'll try to get this done tomorrow.
[219:45.30]And depending on how quickly we beat it tomorrow, we might check out the DLC as well.
[219:51.60]Yeah, I know it's tough.
[219:54.36]You like Dutch.
[219:55.64]He's a charming fellow.
[219:57.49]He makes sense.
[219:59.30]He's like one of those nature writers from back east, only he takes things a tiny little step too far.
[220:09.46]Rather than just loving the flowers and the animals and the harmony between man and beast, he shoots people in the head for money and disagreeing with them.
[220:21.26]He's a goddamn killer.
[220:27.70]promised you the movies and you could oh yeah here's what I was going to do for the movies I'll tell you in a second admiring the flower to shooting a man in the head because he doesn't like the flower is a leap too far so I know it's easy you see we
[220:55.65]I'm not going to tell you what it was because I might end up doing it one day and it's going to be perfect.
[221:04.46]Just pop it into the stream.
[221:06.86]Is this the first playthrough?
[221:09.58]Yes, it is.
[221:20.64]First time.
[221:52.92]Might be perfect equals no plan.
[221:54.61]No, there was a very, very specific plan.
[221:56.85]I just have to actually do it.
[222:07.53]We're going to tell us about the movies like you always do.
[222:09.59]I can't, because I might actually end up doing it, and it would ruin it.
[222:16.20]I can't let it be ruined.
[222:19.34]If I actually do it.
[222:23.98]Your first ever Jerma stream?
[222:25.42]Well, what's up?
[222:26.56]Welcome!
[222:30.18]You know, if you watch this stream for more than 14 seconds, you're...
[222:34.26]You are automatically part of the immediate family.
[222:46.10]That's all it takes to become a family member.
[222:48.53]Watch the stream for 14 seconds.
[223:01.43]I own it.
[223:04.80]Honestly, like... It's okay.
[223:17.08]That guy holding a gun?
[223:22.93]No, I thought he was pointing a gun out, like, hey, quick!
[223:25.85]Oh, I gotta put on a show then, at least, right?
[223:33.94]If you drive by holding the sparkler, you have to wave the sparkler around.
[223:39.02]Let's go.
[223:44.18]That makes me ancient.
[223:51.10]Now we're just playing with fire.
[223:52.32]That's not a good idea.
[223:55.06]Assure us you will download it this week.
[223:57.50]I was about to just kill all the horses.
[223:59.58]No, I can't.
[224:00.20]Not when a mission is like this.
[224:01.98]Do I stay on this?
[224:02.90]I guess, huh?
[224:32.34]I am just realizing that there is a car here.
[224:34.40]This is an actual moving car.
[224:40.44]Have there been any other cars in the whole game so far?
[224:46.39]I don't remember any trucks.
[224:56.88]Rayleigh like just die man
[225:28.71]We should have done this a long time ago!
[225:30.29]Alright, is it weird for me to say that I really truly think I could kill these guys faster with just a regular gun?
[225:35.01]Where are they coming from?
[225:40.47]They're like rats!
[225:45.76]They're shooting faster?
[225:46.74]That might have been like a frame rate thing.
[225:50.96]That was really weird.
[225:51.76]Kill those bastards!
[225:56.70]One more guy, come on, kill him.
[226:06.62]Alright, we're good.
[226:13.39]I want to drive this car.
[226:15.55]Bad.
[226:21.08]Alright, you can go faster than like 8 miles per hour, man.
[226:25.01]I was in the car earlier, and I was too busy reading Dark World fanfiction.
[226:30.19]These are all the explosions.
[226:52.96]And why did I just hit a jackpot?
[226:58.97]And I'm like... With me hitting the rock, I get it.
[227:16.79]What is it?
[227:17.21]I don't know what the hell that is.
[227:30.66]I'm shooting the truck.
[227:34.30]Oh, I am shooting the truck.
[227:37.83]Oh, what's that?
[227:42.28]Seven, seven, seven!
[228:02.03]I'm going to die.
[228:05.90]Oh shit, that guy's got a... Yeah.
[228:12.74]What?
[228:13.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[228:14.90]What?
[228:15.76]I thought that was part of the fucking cutscene.
[228:18.24]Oh, it was.
[228:18.72]Thank God.
[228:19.28]I was going to say, how did I screw that up?
[228:28.60]Wheel helm.
[228:36.06]Well, Mr. Marston, it seems like your mentor Dutch no longer looks quite so kindly to his student.
[228:41.98]That man is insane.
[228:44.28]So it seems.
[228:45.72]I think we need to get him before sundown.
[228:49.58]As you say, Captain.
[228:51.16]Otherwise, he'll be gone again.
[228:52.68]I mean, typically when you see that red screen with the back and forth sweeping black paint, that means you've failed.
[229:00.21]Let me just point out the obvious.
[229:03.10]The one person we have left that can appeal to Mr. Vanderland is the last person we know who knows him.
[229:10.87]Your wife.
[229:13.21]That won't be necessary.
[229:15.27]Mr. Ross, Captain, let's go.
[229:17.39]Thank you, Choff, again, for the bits.
[229:24.99]Appreciate it.
[229:32.16]Ride to Cochine.
[229:34.82]Cochine.
[229:36.18]Cochine.
[229:36.54]I have no idea.
[229:36.84]What am I going to play next?
[229:38.04]So when we're done with Red Dead, which should be tomorrow, I'm going to play The End is Nigh.
[229:55.71]The new Super Meat Boy-esque game by Edmund McMillan.
[230:01.78]Gonna give it a try.
[230:02.60]Just finish the game right now.
[230:18.31]I don't necessarily have another, like, four hours or so.
[230:25.03]I've been streaming for about four hours now, and this was like a little extra stream to try and move Red Dead Redemption along so I could finish it in the next stream or two.
[230:48.35]And plus, even if I finish the game, I want to play Undead Nightmare for a little while.
[230:55.44]So, even if I finish the game tonight, like in the next couple hours or something, I would rather just leave that for tomorrow, so then I could just go right to Undead Nightmare.
[231:21.64]This is a dangerous road, and now I'm stuck.
[231:25.89]Don't be a fool about this.
[231:27.25]Just get on the road.
[231:36.26]Play more than one game at a time.
[231:38.00]I mean, I played a different game literally like two days ago.
[231:52.19]I played a bunch of PSVR games like two days ago.
[231:56.72]What was that?
[231:57.84]What happened?
[232:01.72]Four frog games.
[232:12.66]I'm not playing a YouTube video in a second window.
[232:14.78]I'm not playing my old shit YouTube videos.
[232:16.93]No way.
[232:25.32]Play more than one not shi- Bridge Crew is like considered to be like a very good game.
[232:31.54]Just because I was playing it like a fucking dummy doesn't mean it's like a bad game.
[232:37.08]Bridge Crew is like people love that game.
[232:41.79]And Red Dead Redemption is like not a shitty game.
[232:44.11]What are you on about?
[232:44.97]This is considered to be one of the best games ever made.
[232:48.61]What?
[232:53.25]You guys act, dude, you're acting like this is like fucking Raven's Cry.
[232:56.29]Star Wars nerd crew.
[233:23.06]No, I'm not gonna play house party.
[233:24.54]Go!
[233:26.22]Get down!
[233:36.75]Forward!
[233:40.67]Move in!
[233:41.17]The house party is like... Come on, boys!
[233:43.59]Everybody move in!
[233:44.87]There's a... There's a Prenus on the screen!
[233:47.40]Oh, that's not a gun.
[233:49.14]That's a gun.
[234:10.62]Did you guys see that one game where there was an apprentice on the screen?
[234:16.78]No, I'm not gonna play that game.
[234:19.30]Plus, I don't think you can even stream that game anyways.
[234:31.79]It's one of the top-selling games on Steam?
[234:33.63]Are you serious?
[234:46.80]One more.
[234:51.82]There we go.
[234:55.02]You're still alive.
[234:55.86]You shouldn't be.
[235:01.56]Almost there.
[235:07.83]Push into the village.
[235:10.65]Cause mayhem.
[235:17.59]Where is he?
[235:19.27]He's right there.
[235:25.61]Where's your friend?
[235:29.46]There.
[235:29.74]Oh, no.
[235:30.20]They're just moving in.
[235:38.64]Evan rifle.
[235:39.48]Let's get another... Use the Gatling gun to eliminate everybody.
[235:43.83]Or I could... I could do that.
[235:49.01]Or I could just do this and, like, kill everyone.
[235:52.99]You know, actually, I am gonna use the Gatling gun.
[236:08.42]Like, really, come on.
[236:09.78]What the fuck?
[236:13.88]Give me a fucking break.
[236:20.12]It's so annoying really is come on I Don't even want to I'm not gonna use the Gatling gun I'm not going to use it Oh
[236:55.44]Only one of those exploded?
[236:56.50]That's the guy.
[237:03.94]That's the guy that ruined everything.
[237:20.57]Using the Gatling gun just gets you killed.
[237:28.16]Alright, let's go.
[237:36.67]Three star aim.
[237:37.63]I mean, a four star aim.
[237:48.87]Right, Marston.
[237:49.64]We'll take two men with us.
[237:50.94]The rest will stay here and take care of the wounded.
[237:52.96]So Dutch is obviously the main baddies of the story, right?
[237:59.30]And then there's like a little bit more.
[238:01.37]There's like another couple hours of ending missions.
[238:06.67]Let's go two headshots over here and then two headshots over here.
[238:15.21]No, we're just going to do those.
[238:16.13]Okay, we're going to get one.
[238:27.78]How many times do I have to shoot you in the fucking box?
[238:29.52]I shot that guy six times.
[238:31.93]I'm going to break.
[238:32.51]This is the Wild West.
[238:44.36]Dad, don't run towards the door.
[238:46.26]Run away from the door.
[238:47.06]Uh-oh.
[238:49.26]Me and you.
[238:49.60]He's going to kill him and it's over.
[238:56.98]Kill his guards.
[239:14.92]easy enough now kill dutch hmm I wonder what I need don't stand it burns
[239:45.96]Now I'm going to take him alive.
[239:46.78]I'm going to get him alive.
[239:50.42]I'm going to lasso him.
[240:04.59]Not much longer now.
[240:07.01]Bring him to the train.
[240:09.47]If I can, I'm going to try.
[240:10.83]I'm actually going to try to do that.
[240:19.74]Drag him all the way down.
[240:22.83]Oh, this is a pain.
[240:29.79]Screw him.
[240:30.21]As he goes down and I'm dead.
[240:31.07]That'd be great.
[240:31.91]Do I have to climb this?
[240:35.03]Is there a ladder here?
[240:44.66]Force him to watch JermaCraft.
[240:47.50]That's a fate that no man is worthy of having.
[240:55.83]No man deserves that.
[241:05.50]Bolt, action, rifle.
[241:08.20]Don't know why.
[241:14.20]That's just wasting ammo.
[241:18.54]He's trying to make a point.
[241:19.78]He's using that as sentences.
[241:21.48]He's using the gun as... What?
[241:29.04]That's a good shot.
[241:29.68]Did he shoot me or did I shoot him?
[241:39.97]Did he shoot himself?
[241:58.48]I don't doubt it.
[241:59.12]Don't ask me.
[242:02.03]We can't always fight nature, John.
[242:06.01]We can't fight change.
[242:09.23]Can't fight gravity.
[242:12.17]We can't fight nothing.
[242:15.82]My whole life, all I ever did was fight.
[242:20.10]Then give up, Dutch.
[242:21.44]Lasso fight.
[242:22.42]But I can't give up neither.
[242:25.70]I can't fight my own nature.
[242:28.94]He's going to jump off, isn't he?
[242:32.58]I would assume.
[242:33.02]They made that cutscene in the movies.
[242:34.76]Yeah, he shot me and then he's at the edge here going, ow, my body, somebody shot me.
[243:06.20]He's falling really slowly.
[243:12.03]Okay, is that guy like 42 ounces?
[243:15.47]Is he like an ounce?
[243:18.99]He's as light as a feather.
[243:19.82]The man's dead, Ross.
[243:20.90]Sure.
[243:29.25]No.
[243:36.79]Play the Wallace and Gromit.
[243:37.83]No, that's my best gun.
[243:38.83]I like that gun.
[243:39.53]That's my good gun.
[243:40.79]Don't give him the deagle.
[243:41.65]Everything falls at the same speed.
[243:47.51]Are you serious?
[243:54.37]Your wife was killed.
[243:55.41]Drop a feather outside of your window and tell me how fast it falls.
[243:58.71]I'm only joking, dear boy.
[244:02.39]They were sent back to that Scrabble ranch of yours in Beecher's Hope.
[244:07.57]They're quite safe and sound.
[244:10.03]They better be.
[244:11.52]Thank you, Mr. Morrison, for everything.
[244:14.66]I know this wasn't easy for you, but I have to say, you've done your country proud.
[244:20.52]Yeah, exactly.
[244:22.66]See you around, John.
[244:24.76]Try to stay out of trouble.
[244:26.22]Come on, Archer.
[244:27.74]Let's go find somebody else we can annoy.
[244:34.34]Drop a cotton ball out the window and drop a bowling ball and tell me which one lands first.
[244:41.37]Do it!
[244:44.29]Go on your roof, take a fucking bowling ball, drop it off your roof and drop a small cotton ball at the same time.
[244:49.20]Which one hits the ground first?
[244:52.37]Is this me singing?
[245:00.89]This is John Marston singing this song.
[245:21.05]Oh, this is definitely the end of the game, then.
[245:22.85]Am I gonna live if I jump down this?
[245:43.33]It's two bears.
[245:45.29]Two bears, by the way.
[245:47.01]Just if anyone was... And there you go.
[245:51.78]That's Red Dead Redemption.
[245:52.98]John Marston dies at the end of the game.
[245:55.70]He was on his way to collect his fucking bounty and see his family.
[245:58.82]And two bears killed him.
[246:00.36]And threw him off a fucking building.
[246:06.42]How did I screw- What do you mean screw that up?
[246:08.34]I was just sitting around and I got attacked by two fucking bears!
[246:15.06]How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[246:25.03]The song ain't gonna play again.
[246:26.63]Well, sorry.
[246:29.13]Ruined the song.
[246:33.99]Stop playing now.
[246:34.67]The real ending can't get better than that.
[246:38.73]Supposed to follow the road.
[246:39.87]I was... Whatever.
[246:43.29]Should've... Song's gone.
[246:49.58]Well, it's okay.
[246:51.68]We're going to Abigail Marston.
[246:53.78]My daughter.
[246:55.28]My wife, I mean.
[246:55.96]Whatever.
[246:56.73]Whatever.
[246:59.74]Best part of the game and it's ruined for a shitty I died joke.
[247:02.73]I didn't, I wasn't doing that on purpose.
[247:04.89]Like, I don't know what you guys think of me.
[247:07.47]I didn't do that on purpose.
[247:11.09]I was trying to look and see if there was a way for me just to hop down.
[247:14.10]I was like, am I going to die if I fall down this?
[247:16.76]And I wouldn't have.
[247:17.76]I probably was going to be able to make that.
[247:19.86]I wasn't on fucking purpose.
[247:23.62]I didn't fucking console command spawn two bears right next to me.
[247:26.93]What?
[247:29.01]How the fuck was I supposed to do that?
[247:44.97]The end of Red Dead.
[247:47.87]I'm gonna play through the entire game so we get that song again.
[247:55.33]I planted the bears.
[247:57.25]I knew it.
[247:57.83]I knew it was going to happen.
[247:58.77]Alright, well, let's see what happens at the end of Red Dead Redemption.
[248:02.01]I guess maybe I can just beat the game on stream right now.
[248:04.99]And then we'll do Undead Nightmare tomorrow, I guess.
[248:08.01]I guess that's what's going to happen.
[248:08.95]We'll find out right now, right?
[248:13.33]Look, I'll help you out here.
[248:14.63]I'll redo the song for you.
[248:19.01]That's what it was.
[248:19.53]It was something like that.
[248:22.29]Jack!
[248:24.62]Anyone here?
[248:25.24]I have 10 missions to go.
[248:32.92]Anyone home?
[248:38.22]Oh, darling.
[248:39.55]I never thought I'd see this day again.
[248:42.13]You no-good hillbilly piece of shit.
[248:44.83]I thought you was dead.
[248:45.77]I thought you was dead, John, huh?
[248:47.87]Where you been?
[248:48.79]Where you been?
[248:49.65]You know where I've been, darling.
[248:51.63]You know.
[248:53.05]You saw Dutch, didn't you?
[248:55.01]Yeah, I saw him.
[248:55.93]And Bill?
[248:57.16]Yeah, I saw him too.
[248:58.74]And you didn't go back to him?
[249:01.30]I left that life.
[249:03.06]Just as you left yours.
[249:07.44]How'd they treat you?
[249:09.18]I can take care of myself, John.
[249:11.54]One guard got funny on me one time, but I wasn't so ladylike and he didn't try it again.
[249:16.22]Or no one else.
[249:18.80]How's the boy?
[249:21.51]Like you.
[249:22.09]And like me.
[249:25.37]She's gonna take a rubber mask off and be a bear.
[249:27.09]Stop ignoring the beauty of the Jerma craft.
[250:01.69]Okay, there's the ending hug.
[250:05.13]There's my son.
[250:06.01]Don't call me sir.
[250:10.79]Call me dad.
[250:14.22]Dad, sir.
[250:15.14]Sir, dad, to you.
[250:15.92]I know you did, son.
[250:16.34]I know.
[250:16.54]Don't you go back.
[250:28.15]There's crazy grandpa.
[250:30.51]I just had a big hot dog with a lot of mustard on it.
[250:33.37]You know how much I love my mustard.
[250:35.47]I like to eat it with no hands.
[250:58.51]I wasn't drinking.
[250:59.37]Hold your excuses until you've figured out which one to use.
[251:03.59]Jack, go get your bags packed, boy.
[251:06.47]We've got work to do.
[251:07.17]We leave in the morning.
[251:07.93]Alright, let's go.
[251:09.93]Go on.
[251:11.01]Yes, sir.
[251:11.58]Wait for those credits.
[251:12.32]Where are you going?
[251:14.58]Well, it's getting kind of dark now, but in the morning we've got to go get ourselves some more cattle.
[251:20.40]I don't have to do a herding mission right now, do I?
[251:22.76]We've got friends at McFarland's Ranch.
[251:24.94]It's over in Hennigan's Stead.
[251:26.12]You can sell us some.
[251:29.26]Mustard's healthy for you?
[251:31.72]Alright, well.
[251:33.11]Herding?
[251:34.21]Mission?
[251:34.89]I mean... Oh, great.
[251:35.73]Not this.
[252:01.08]Why do I still have all my clothes on?
[252:04.14]If we were just lying in bed together, why would I be in my full cowboy outfit?
[252:19.99]Wait, I need my sensor bar again.
[252:21.52]Do I?
[252:22.54]She's not going to stand up and be naked, is she?
[252:30.88]No, that's not it.
[252:31.56]That's not it.
[252:32.96]That's not the sensor bar.
[252:34.33]That's... Okay.
[252:37.37]Accompany Jack.
[252:47.62]What, is there like two missions left?
[252:49.50]There's gonna be like three missions left or something.
[252:51.66]We're gonna do like a herding mission and then all of a sudden someone's gonna like
[252:58.47]Someone's gonna train my boy, and I'm gonna be like, how could you?
[253:02.13]How could you train my son?
[253:05.83]And he's gonna be like, yes, I trained him.
[253:09.23]It was me.
[253:11.57]And then I'm gonna close range shotgun blast him in the fucking head.
[253:15.54]How you feeling, Jack?
[253:18.06]I'm feeling fine, sir.
[253:19.78]We got a decent ride ahead of us.
[253:21.96]I've never been to Henniginstead.
[253:24.08]How do you know these ranchers?
[253:29.78]Where is he?
[253:30.56]I'm just thinking back to what I just did.
[253:33.30]That was very low effort.
[253:34.16]I said, yee-hee-hee, it was me.
[253:36.09]I trained him.
[253:53.39]That was extremely low effort, and I apologize.
[253:55.73]Like, I'm trying to think back what the fuck I was even going with that.
[254:00.48]No, we're gonna speedrun the end of the game, don't worry.
[254:06.76]Jesus Christ!
[254:08.06]That guy was a stepping stool.
[254:17.97]That's about right.
[254:19.39]Some people thought I owed them some favors.
[254:21.93]Why did they take us away?
[254:23.73]They thought it wasn't safe for you here by yourself.
[254:26.02]Those men harmed you?
[254:28.30]I know.
[254:28.74]They're okay.
[254:29.58]Some of them even told me stories.
[254:33.10]I think I'd like to be a government man one day.
[254:36.44]I'd rather you chose an honest profession.
[254:39.04]Well, like you, you mean?
[254:40.62]I know I ain't been the best father, Jack.
[254:42.54]I made some bad choices.
[254:46.89]I'm gonna kill him.
[254:47.75]Then I'm gonna have to go save my family, and at the very end, I don't, like, save them or something, and I go into exile.
[254:55.89]And then Red Dead Redemption 2 is me coming out of exile.
[254:58.45]Yeah, I caught up with Bill and Dutch.
[254:59.83]We had some old business needed settling.
[255:03.43]Where are they now?
[255:18.78]There's a face I thought I'd never see again.
[255:21.65]Some of our public servants in Blackwater sent you back on another homicidal errand to protect and save us from Lord only knows what.
[255:28.99]Thankfully not, sir.
[255:30.51]I was hoping you might still be able to sell me some cows.
[255:32.97]Alright, quiet, quiet.
[255:33.79]It would be a pleasure.
[255:35.08]Monty's out in the crowd now.
[255:37.00]She'll be more than happy to help you.
[255:42.34]Take care now, Mr. McFarlane.
[255:44.42]Good luck.
[255:50.88]Come on.
[255:51.38]No, we're supposed to be speedrunning.
[255:55.50]We're supposed to be getting to the end.
[255:56.66]You guys weren't kidding.
[255:58.49]It really is a herding mission.
[255:59.67]It actually is a herding mission.
[256:00.61]You guys were not kidding.
[256:01.53]I really thought you were.
[256:17.38]Here comes the big double cross.
[256:18.32]Look, they wouldn't do a boring mission like this without a double cross.
[256:22.52]Come on, then.
[256:50.94]Hurting mission damn Wow How do you go from gigantic shootout with hundreds of enemies these dumb cow missions It's okay.
[257:08.11]I'm actually good at these One thing in this fucking game.
[257:11.83]I'm good at is the one thing that everybody hates go figure right I
[257:18.79]I don't know if farming's him.
[257:20.13]Go on.
[257:20.47]Mm-hmm.
[257:20.71]It's been settled.
[257:44.57]Last I heard.
[257:45.35]Come on.
[257:46.17]Stay with it.
[257:46.73]You fucking stupid pigs.
[257:48.79]They look like cows.
[257:49.41]It's like... Yeah, they are cows.
[257:54.58]Stay on the road.
[258:21.70]Get out of the way.
[258:24.40]Why are they all going after her?
[258:26.10]What are you doing?
[258:27.62]They're tethered.
[258:29.84]They're tethered to this guy.
[258:34.70]Through the river?
[258:35.48]Nobody can go in water in this game.
[258:36.89]What are you talking about?
[258:39.21]Drive the herd across the river?
[258:42.11]I thought no person, man, or beast could go through the water.
[258:47.81]Well, okay.
[258:48.21]I guess it's shallow enough where it's okay.
[258:54.38]15 out of 15.
[258:54.72]Farmer McFarlane.
[258:56.20]This is fun.
[259:21.86]We can't go faster.
[259:22.66]I wish I could just make them go faster.
[259:23.92]Just sprint behind them as they sprint.
[259:30.58]In before 5 out of 15.
[259:36.75]Why would I get 5 out of 15?
[259:38.97]Right here.
[259:41.31]And as you've seen in the previous missions, I am a very good herder.
[259:44.15]I'm not going to say I'm the best herder, but I'm very good at it.
[259:53.78]I have discipline.
[259:54.90]I have patience when it comes to these types of things.
[260:01.06]Gotta steer them away from the trees.
[260:04.56]This don't look right.
[260:07.50]Um... Okay.
[260:07.78]You take care of the herd, Jack.
[260:08.84]Don't you dare.
[260:29.52]That's a lot of people.
[260:39.88]Alright, let's go with the herd.
[260:41.06]Keep the herd up.
[260:41.48]I think that's all of them.
[260:43.24]Jack, wait there.
[260:44.60]I'm coming.
[260:46.12]You alright?
[260:47.42]You're not hurt, are you?
[260:48.06]Heard, heard, heard.
[260:49.64]Fifteen out of fifteen.
[260:50.48]Let's go.
[260:50.84]I wasn't scared on it.
[260:53.52]Sorry you had to see that, son.
[260:55.56]Jack.
[260:55.74]The men won't be stealing from anybody else.
[260:57.92]Jack, don't make me fail this mission because you won't move.
[261:00.22]Okay.
[261:01.52]Good.
[261:02.12]Nothing like seeing your dad kill ten men.
[261:13.20]I know, right?
[261:17.72]He went such a stupid way.
[261:19.36]Are these more shooters?
[261:24.18]Are these bad guys?
[261:27.55]No, that just scared the hell out of me.
[261:31.53]I'm not lassoing, Jack.
[261:32.91]We need to get this game, like, finished so I can go to Undead Nightmare tomorrow.
[261:41.11]We're gonna get, like, one more of those.
[261:45.80]It'll be a big ambush.
[261:58.51]I'm not going to rush it.
[261:59.53]I'm just saying.
[262:00.30]I don't want to end this mission by killing Jack.
[262:06.34]Which then... Don't you fucking think about it.
[262:09.08]You've won... 14 out of 15.
[262:12.21]Get in there.
[262:13.23]Go.
[262:13.39]Don't think so.
[262:14.53]Go on.
[262:16.35]Go on.
[262:28.66]I gotta get 15 out of 15, otherwise I'm not a fucking good gamer.
[262:31.34]Get in there.
[262:34.90]11 out of 15.
[262:36.15]How did that happen?
[262:38.11]14 out of 15, and there it is.
[262:41.33]15 out of 15.
[262:41.55]We made it.
[262:42.03]Easy.
[262:54.74]Hitch it.
[262:55.14]That's a fine herd we got ourselves.
[262:57.02]Good gamer.
[262:57.58]So we're ranchers now?
[262:59.91]Did a good job, son.
[263:01.03]Nice shooting.
[263:02.31]Thanks, Paul.
[263:04.01]He's got some messy hair.
[263:12.47]Cowherd at plus 15.
[263:13.63]Rancher clothing menu added.
[263:15.26]Okay.
[263:16.78]A?
[263:17.06]Wait, we got like open... We have Jack and A... J and A?
[263:22.32]So I have to just be like a family man?
[263:28.11]It's just family man time.
[263:39.23]Just hanging out with mom and dad.
[263:40.70]Dad simulator.
[263:49.52]Well, it's an adventure, sir.
[263:52.64]Set out in the west, and it tells this amazing story of how people killed the savage redskins, and how this man, this brave man, hunts the man who killed his father.
[264:02.43]I'm glad you're enjoying it.
[264:04.57]Talking of adventure, how'd you like to learn to track them?
[264:11.11]Really big ones in the valley this time of year.
[264:13.73]We could use the meat.
[264:18.37]Dr. Plato, thanks for the five dollars.
[264:20.01]Jerma, please hide the chat for the last few missions.
[264:23.97]I mean, these are the last few missions, aren't they?
[264:27.31]I got like, what, like an hour, maybe?
[264:28.62]It's a hunting mission.
[264:29.74]This is stupid.
[264:48.85]Sorry, I gotta put him out of his misery.
[264:51.05]Why are you aiming at me?
[264:52.85]Why are you aiming at me?
[265:01.26]Oh, a dog.
[265:06.80]Better not be looking in here, Jeremy.
[265:09.38]Oh, you actually do go with the dog.
[265:16.57]No, the dog's name is Rufus.
[265:17.91]That's a really good Rugrats dog sound.
[265:19.07]Remember Spike from Rugrats?
[265:34.97]There he is.
[265:35.39]Okay.
[265:35.67]What was he looking at?
[265:36.85]Oh, no.
[265:37.31]Please don't shoot at me.
[265:39.17]Okay, good.
[265:39.83]Every mission in this game, you just get ambushed.
[266:00.58]What does he got what he got boy What do you got dog what is it boy Did you find a bison he's gonna lose to a bear just watch it
[266:27.41]The bear's just gonna, like, jump away and grab my son and rip his head off.
[266:31.57]Yeah, one time I hunted a bear.
[266:34.19]One time I hunted a bear.
[266:35.63]Yeah, let me tell you about this one time's son.
[266:51.66]A bear killed me before, it was crazy.
[266:54.66]Shoot the elk.
[266:55.18]Where's this, where's this elk?
[267:04.67]Oh, right there.

[267:10.71]Is there a beaver?
[267:22.40]Use the homing missile.
[267:23.24]Aiming at the head while hunting?
[267:24.57]What?
[267:25.25]What are you talking about?
[267:43.33]I want to kill the animal.
[267:44.69]This is a video game.
[267:46.65]I don't want it to get away.
[267:47.63]I'll fail the mission.
[267:48.81]And I'll look like a dumbass in front of my son.
[267:50.59]Shoot his horse.
[267:51.35]Not happening.
[267:52.85]We're too close to being end of the game.
[267:55.29]I ain't going to trip up my son.
[268:08.68]He is my son.
[268:10.78]My first son.
[268:12.56]I'll find another.
[268:15.67]Find another one, Rufus.
[268:23.43]That's it.
[268:24.43]Good boy.
[268:28.85]Good boy.
[268:30.97]Through the bushes.
[268:36.09]That's it.
[268:37.01]Good boy.
[268:41.23]Just joined the stream.
[268:42.15]What's going on in the game?
[268:43.15]Uh, we're near the end, I think.
[268:48.63]So isn't it her turn?
[268:49.39]It's her turn.
[268:50.11]Isn't it his turn?
[268:50.75]Whatever.
[268:51.45]Is this a wife and son, daughter?
[268:52.83]Who cares?
[268:54.76]He's just riding and shooting.
[268:57.10]What are you doing?
[268:59.26]You're not doing this right.
[269:00.16]Now dad has to fucking go into super slow motion mode and clean up after your fucking mess.
[269:04.40]What is this?
[269:08.23]Really?
[269:08.51]Really?
[269:11.39]That was awful!
[269:14.57]You did not do that right.
[269:17.31]Go ahead, cut it up.
[269:18.25]Whoa!
[269:19.37]What a reaction.
[269:41.48]Yeah, he really got it on the camera.
[269:58.95]For one second I thought he just put that in his leg.
[270:00.77]I thought he stabbed himself.
[270:01.77]Alright, trading post.
[270:14.56]Head this way.
[270:16.12]Did you see me?
[270:22.84]Come on, buddy.
[270:23.74]Let's go.
[270:28.21]We don't got time for this.
[270:29.23]We gotta sell, sell, sell.
[270:31.03]I'm surprised I haven't used any cheats.
[270:37.79]There's cheats in this game, right?
[270:40.49]I'm assuming there would be.
[270:47.41]Stay in the road.
[270:48.61]No funny business.
[270:58.77]Manzanita Post.
[271:00.23]Here it is.
[271:06.76]Sell the elk meat at the store.
[271:09.06]Why?
[271:09.32]Okay, it's giving me like the beginning of the game tutorial.
[271:15.61]Go to the shopkeeper and sell the meat.
[271:19.35]I have a lot of shit, so... We'll sell it all.
[271:22.19]We've come full circle.
[271:22.89]We have.
[271:23.11]What do we got?
[271:23.93]Tomahawk.
[271:24.67]Um...
[271:44.24]Yeah.
[271:44.44]I sure will.
[271:44.80]Tomahawk.
[271:45.06]Is this just you fucking whip tomahawks at people?
[271:49.39]All done.
[271:49.79]Let's head home.
[272:13.82]Oh, that's so cool.
[272:16.84]Why have you taken this long to give that to me?
[272:23.45]I would test it on somebody.
[272:26.09]I can't.
[272:28.13]Are they homing tomahawks?
[272:29.19]Are they really?
[272:31.52]Let's see.
[272:36.16]Oh man, that's awesome.
[272:39.20]That's so perfect.
[272:41.06]You could get some insane shots if you were right around throwing tomahawks at people.
[272:45.72]Dead-eye tomahawk.
[272:48.19]I mean, I have to, right?
[273:12.32]Don't make me do the whole thing again.
[273:18.62]Thank you.
[273:19.58]I was about to be very, very upset.
[273:21.30]I didn't know if it was going to make me do the whole thing again.
[273:28.87]For some reason, I thought we were, like, done with the mission.
[273:30.97]That we were just going home.
[273:34.87]We're good.
[273:39.00]ADHD, yes.
[273:44.70]I am going to try Undead Nightmare.
[273:46.50]I believe that's probably the plan tomorrow.
[273:49.20]Tomorrow's stream, 7 p.m.
[273:51.24]Eastern Time.
[273:53.88]I'm going to do Undead Nightmare.
[273:57.52]And then, Thursday, we're going to start The End is Nigh.
[274:02.24]Or I might do The End is Nigh tomorrow and do Undead Nightmare on Thursday.
[274:09.68]Maybe.
[274:10.62]We shall see.
[274:11.04]There's that.

[275:23.23]Are you sure about that?
[275:35.82]I startled him.
[275:40.30]What did you think that was?
[275:41.40]Uncle?
[275:42.64]Uncle?
[275:46.25]Lie back down.
[275:51.71]Oh, man.
[275:52.25]Well, at least he's awake.
[275:54.61]Can I pick that up?
[275:59.23]Yeah.

[276:11.82]Okay, I'm going to turn around.
[276:12.60]I'm going to come back later.
[276:15.98]Imagine being woken up by... Now my son is holding a gun out.
[276:21.75]What are they all searching for?
[276:22.91]Are they like waiting?
[276:24.05]Is he trying to shoot the mom?
[276:26.48]Are you trying to kill mom?
[276:30.38]He's like, I'll just wait till mom comes out.
[276:31.82]Is she out yet?
[276:32.72]I'm gonna fucking shoot her when she comes out.
[276:36.19]What is this?
[276:49.47]No, you know, he's gonna- he's gonna- Is this gonna end the game?
[276:53.23]Is this gonna fuck up the whole game?
[276:56.71]This is not gonna fuck the whole game up, right?
[277:08.30]I was so scared it was gonna fu- I was so scared it was gonna break my game.

[277:29.28]Oh, shit!
[277:49.52]My stomach hurts.
[277:58.74]The fact that she said, what's happening, is what's funny to me.
[278:04.95]That wasn't, whatever, like, oh no, you fucking threw an axe at somebody.
[278:09.35]But I fell down and died.
[278:13.71]She's running around saying, what's happening?

[278:40.10]She turns.
[278:40.42]She was dead in eight seconds, by the way.
[278:43.16]You can ax in your head.
[278:44.26]You have like five seconds before you're dead.
[278:56.28]So think about it.
[278:57.02]She gets an axe in the fucking back of her head.
[278:58.77]That hurts.
[278:59.31]She's going to die.
[279:00.29]Turns around.
[279:00.77]I'm on the ground having a heart attack.
[279:02.91]Maybe you would scream what's happening.
[279:04.37]Like, who just did this to you?

[283:05.21]Okay.
[283:11.98]Another one.
[283:12.60]Old friends, new problems.
[283:14.34]We got a telegram from some lady friend of yours.
[283:17.16]A Bonnie something or other.
[283:19.04]Something you ain't telling me?
[283:21.42]Bonnie McFarlane.
[283:22.80]She's a friend.
[283:24.39]Saved my life when I went after Bill and nearly got myself killed.
[283:26.45]There's a horse in the house.
[283:27.97]Oh, now you two's in the habit of sending each other letters.
[283:30.11]Look behind her.
[283:31.57]No, that's a chair.
[283:32.23]Never mind.
[283:33.65]Never mind.
[283:34.59]What's it say?
[283:35.55]I don't know.
[283:36.07]I can't.
[283:38.47]Well, you know I can't read.
[283:40.40]Give it here.
[283:44.11]You read that thing out loud?
[283:45.11]I ain't hiding nothing.
[283:51.62]I didn't shoot on her.
[283:53.44]Stop.
[283:55.02]Need corn sacks.
[283:57.24]Stop.
[283:58.74]Emergency.
[284:00.02]Stop.
[284:01.56]Weevils and moths ate entire county supply.
[284:04.92]Stop.
[284:06.62]Can you help?
[284:07.64]Stop.
[284:08.08]Not exactly the most romantic request now, is it?
[284:10.66]I guess not.
[284:13.16]Yeah, hold on.
[284:13.76]How would she know that I was, like, cheating on her or something if she can't read?
[284:17.56]Uh-oh.
[284:17.68]This is gonna be, like, Freaky Friday.
[284:50.10]Get in the wagon.
[284:52.11]Psycho father.
[285:01.73]Get back in that house, you little shit!
[285:04.66]Oh no.
[285:07.16]Okay, she's... She's coming with me.
[285:19.17]Well, I just buried an axe in her.
[285:24.79]She's okay.
[285:28.89]I assaulted Abigail.
[285:35.96]Took a long time for her to figure that out.
[285:38.78]Come on, it's a corn emergency.
[285:50.70]We're timed again.
[285:51.60]Again, this has to be... Something here is going to happen, right?
[285:57.70]We're going back into town.
[285:58.96]I could have done the other missions if I wanted to.
[286:00.61]She's going to get double-crossed here.
[286:16.21]It's just character building I feel like I need to step on it here
[286:41.99]Mm-hmm.
[286:42.71]Come on.
[286:43.19]Farland Ranch.
[286:45.59]What is this route we're taking?
[286:48.25]Was I supposed to go on that bridge?
[286:49.59]That seemed like a very dangerous place to go.
[287:08.66]Relationship simulator.
[287:09.42]Everything has to be a simulator.
[287:10.88]Yeah, this GPS is terrible.
[287:11.80]I'm going to get robbed or something, right?
[287:14.18]Yeah.
[287:37.07]Do not do that now, please.
[287:38.81]I'm getting, like, concerned about this timer.
[287:41.25]Am I not going fast enough?
[287:42.43]Okay.
[288:05.35]Okay, we're right there.
[288:06.09]I was going to say, this is... How far is this?
[288:08.29]Watch out for Bambi.
[288:09.83]Ooh, good.
[288:10.67]Bambi got away.
[288:11.55]This is an old-school game trial.
[288:12.83]Alright, let's go.
[288:14.19]General Store, sell it.
[288:36.79]Sell, sell, sell.
[288:38.49]Thank you so much.
[288:39.81]We lost the entire harvest.
[288:42.07]Miss McFarlane, I'd like you to meet my wife.
[288:45.68]Yeah, I do.
[288:46.60]Oh, ain't you quite the gentleman all of a sudden?
[288:49.52]It's a pleasure to meet you.
[288:50.64]Thank you, PP Slap for the bits.
[288:52.58]Also, Dr. Plateau again.
[288:54.04]Thanks again.
[288:55.62]I could get you already, but thanks.
[288:59.85]I didn't teach him anything.
[289:01.91]I know better than to try to change a man.
[289:04.88]Thanks.
[289:05.08]What are these usernames?
[289:06.94]I don't even keep track anymore of the insane usernames that I've seen over the last few years.
[289:30.69]Are these the same actress?
[289:31.33]No, no, they're different.
[289:32.57]They're a little different.
[289:33.51]Okay.
[290:00.93]Complete that one.
[290:03.27]Wave goodbye.
[290:04.02]Rat meat.
[290:13.30]And then here comes the big reveal.
[290:15.54]She placed landmines everywhere.
[290:17.46]See?
[290:17.76]Look at her.
[290:18.58]She's testing for landmines.
[290:20.34]She's like, did I put one here?
[290:21.49]No, I think they're up a little bit further.
[290:26.53]Good luck to you, John Marston.
[290:28.95]You're gonna need it.
[290:41.22]Okay.
[290:44.40]Let's go home, Abigail.
[290:46.14]You've always wanted to be a Monster Rancher.
[290:48.64]Heh.
[290:48.88]Heh.
[290:48.98]Heh.
[291:14.10]This streamer is trying too hard.
[291:17.06]Trying too hard or not trying at all?
[291:20.60]That's the question for the fucking philosophers in a hundred years.
[291:42.93]Do you guys think that in like 500 years they're gonna unearth like a stream I did somehow?
[291:50.41]Am I gonna be like studied or something?
[291:54.52]For like online media?
[291:55.78]I think one day they'll be like a college professor in like a thousand years.
[292:12.16]breaks down like twitch.tv and they get like this one clip of me getting killed by a bear.
[292:15.59]Oh God, I hope not.
[292:16.89]We don't have 500 years left on Earth.
[292:19.83]Stephen Hawking said so.
[292:46.02]In a hundred years the Indiana Joneses are gonna be fucking dorks.
[292:51.31]Stop whipping them.
[292:52.69]They only go fast if you say go fast.
[292:54.41]They don't go fast if you say go slow.
[292:57.33]I'm not even whipping them.
[292:58.09]I'm just putting my hands in the air and just like going down fast.
[293:01.61]Holding two long cords that are attached to their heads.
[293:08.46]That noise, I'm wearing like swishy Nike pants.
[293:12.37]You guys, I got it all wrong.
[293:14.75]Guys, I had a windbreaker on.
[293:16.29]It was making all that swishy noise.
[293:39.21]Alright.
[293:43.25]Two missions here.
[293:43.85]Okay, J and U. I still haven't been able to do a U mission because he's just never here.
[293:51.73]He's not like in the back of this, is he?
[293:54.45]No.
[293:54.77]Well, J is here.
[293:55.63]At least it looked like he was.
[294:01.46]There you are.
[294:06.11]Alright, son.
[294:06.95]Move over to your designated mission start time.
[294:09.07]He's scratching his asshole.
[294:13.23]Go over here.
[294:14.13]Go to your start mission zone.
[294:20.26]Like, I ain't gonna say it again.
[294:23.88]Go on.
[294:30.67]Yeah, I know.
[294:31.17]I know it's really annoying.
[294:33.07]But just go.
[294:33.79]Go.
[294:34.71]Go back to the start mission zone.
[294:43.76]It's playing like creepy piano music too.
[294:46.72]My family member is not here right now.
[294:48.36]Yes, he is.
[294:49.66]He's right here.
[294:51.55]Give me my X. He's right there.
[294:53.77]There he is.
[294:55.19]Start mission.
[295:09.28]Time to go to bed, I guess, and wake up.
[295:11.24]Seriously.
[295:16.98]How the hell are you?
[295:18.80]Upstairs or downstairs?
[295:19.88]I don't know.
[295:20.42]I guess you're in here.
[295:22.00]Oh, a chest.
[295:25.09]Train him?
[295:26.13]No.
[295:29.93]I talked all that shit about a twin in my own house.
[295:31.89]I got a queen.
[295:32.51]That's what I'm talking about.
[295:35.65]John Marston knows how to live.
[295:41.09]It's the only queen in the whole game.
[295:45.55]Is it... I think it's like dark out.
[295:47.13]No, I gotta sleep, I think.
[295:48.85]Sleep again.
[295:57.30]One save file?
[295:58.28]Yeah, I didn't need another one.
[296:03.16]Is that... How early is it?
[296:05.90]Do you guys see an X out there?
[296:14.57]We're just sleeping over and over again to try to hang out with our son.
[296:21.09]Okay, that looks like it's a pretty good spot, right?
[296:23.45]Do I see you next?
[296:30.82]What time is it?
[296:34.40]It is 1 p.m.
[296:36.26]Is that good enough?
[296:48.35]Not 1 p.m., 11.
[296:48.95]1 p.m.
[296:51.03]Where the fuck are you?
[296:59.09]There, finally.
[297:00.01]I can play with the uncle.
[297:01.95]Alright, uncle, let's go.
[297:06.71]Can't read clocks.
[297:07.67]I'm tired.
[297:09.41]I'm like this guy.
[297:14.36]Would you rather watch JermaCraft on stream or play Garfield Cart?
[297:17.02]Play Garfield Cart for 10 straight hours without being able to eat food.
[297:22.05]Get up!
[297:27.01]In fact, after the stream is done, I have to eat the cartridge.
[297:30.27]Well, thank the good Lord you're back.
[297:33.05]Nothing worse for an old man than sleeping in the warm afternoon sun.
[297:37.91]You want a long sleep, Uncle?
[297:39.79]That can be arranged.
[297:41.43]There are two missions left in the game, right?
[297:43.75]Or three or something.
[297:44.69]His beard looks like uncooked ramen.
[298:10.79]No, don't start saying that.
[298:11.77]Now I'm gonna want to eat food.
[298:19.41]Another hur- I think you guys really weren't fucking around.
[298:26.00]I saw somebody in chat say, Good luck, dude.
[298:30.48]This is like a bunch of dumb, boring, hurting missions.
[298:33.44]And I was like, there's no way they're gonna put that in the end of the game.
[298:36.39]Why would they do that?
[298:37.29]And they did.
[298:38.51]What is this?
[298:40.88]Alright.
[298:50.19]Well, here we go.
[298:58.86]Drive the herd outside Beecher's Hope.
[299:02.26]Okie dokie.
[299:07.81]Isn't he supposed to be behind me too?
[299:11.19]Where are you all going?
[299:12.57]Excuse me.
[299:16.35]Not gonna happen.
[299:17.95]Back it up.
[299:19.03]Back it up, ladies.
[299:19.97]Aren't all cows are ladies, right?
[299:22.49]Yeah.
[299:23.53]Let's go, ladies.
[299:26.26]Come on.
[299:30.32]You can do it.
[299:32.46]Come on, ladies.
[299:37.00]Come on, ladies.
[299:51.83]Old Bessie.
[299:54.13]15 out of 15 again?
[299:54.97]Can we do it again?
[299:56.05]What do you guys think?
[300:11.56]Come on!
[300:14.92]Chest.
[300:17.78]A random chest in the middle of nowhere?
[300:19.38]Why?
[300:20.40]What's in here?
[300:24.28]Someone was just keeping 19 bucks in there.
[300:27.36]Just out in the open like that.
[300:28.36]Is that odd?
[300:32.98]It's a very odd placement for a chest.
[300:38.72]Did somebody just say Val Venus?
[300:43.66]Like the wrestler?
[300:44.42]The guy with like the speedo?
[300:45.56]Like the pink speedo?
[300:47.26]When he used to come out, his entrance was like a saxophone?
[300:49.48]I remember Val Venus.
[300:54.96]He sucked, by the way.
[300:55.94]He's the fucking worst wrestler ever.
[301:00.26]Did he even have any moves?
[301:06.07]What is this?
[301:06.49]What are you doing here?
[301:07.33]You're stampeding.
[301:11.39]Slow down.
[301:12.19]Everybody slow down.
[301:12.87]15 out of 15.
[301:18.36]Come on.
[301:21.72]Now these people decide whether to stay with the herd or stop the outlaws.
[301:25.36]We stay with the herd.
[301:29.64]No, you know what we do?
[301:32.01]We stay with the herd.
[301:33.51]And we stop the outlaws.
[301:43.09]We stay with the herd.
[301:44.39]And we fucking support our local man.
[301:47.36]And stop this shit in its tracks.
[302:01.72]There it goes.
[302:04.04]You're welcome.
[302:05.12]And he's gonna get 15 out of 15.
[302:12.92]Easy, Grandpa.
[302:30.10]Grandpa, will you chill out?
[302:33.02]He's fucking freaking me out here.
[302:35.40]This way.
[302:37.61]Come on back.
[302:38.43]Go on.
[302:45.07]Go, go, go, go.
[302:48.27]Throw dynamite at the cows.
[302:49.89]Absolutely not.
[302:52.38]I'm not losing this mission.
[302:53.68]These are the most boring missions in the game.
[302:55.18]You think I'd want to blow this and have to do it all over again?
[303:02.39]Not far, no.
[303:11.27]Where's the fifth?
[303:13.49]Okay.
[303:16.76]Yeah, we can't lose all these ladies.
[303:18.04]Do it on my own, okay.
[303:31.69]We have 200 honor.
[303:39.25]Well, have fun, ladies.
[303:46.91]Oh, wait a minute.
[303:48.39]It's like mating season, right?
[303:50.49]We have the buffalo go towards... The bison have to go towards the ladies.
[303:55.47]Let's mix it up.
[303:57.29]Let's get these girls to hang out with the boys, right?
[304:01.32]Otherwise, how they... It's like a school dance.
[304:04.80]All the girls are staying on one side, all the boys are on the other side.
[304:07.18]Now, let's take... Somebody has to start dancing.
[304:18.10]Please, come with me.
[304:22.00]Come over here, watch.
[304:23.27]Somebody just has to start dancing.
[304:25.13]Once one person starts dancing, everyone will start dancing.
[304:30.49]Come on, you can do it.
[304:33.49]And then I'm gonna go get a random guy, and then we're gonna play like a sting song.
[304:45.41]Come on down here.
[304:46.09]Alright, lady.
[304:56.17]I just want to introduce you to some people.
[304:59.75]And let's go get one of the males.
[305:01.11]Let's go get a guy.
[305:02.29]Okay, so you.
[305:03.75]You're like the other one sitting over there drinking the punch.
[305:05.39]Oh, you got away.
[305:12.62]Okay, um... How about this one?
[305:17.10]Oh, that's a pig.
[305:18.22]Okay, that's a pig.
[305:20.26]It's alright.
[305:20.74]Sometimes the ugly ducklings are the ones that are like the fucking nicest.
[305:25.97]Horse, please.
[305:27.21]Go this way.
[305:29.91]I can't- I can't move the horse.
[305:31.49]He's fighting me.
[305:35.37]Fucking whatever.
[305:35.99]Is he actually gonna do it?
[305:40.87]No, now he's angry with me.
[305:46.38]School dancers are hard to fucking organize!
[305:57.62]Get- Move, please.
[306:06.67]Okay, I'm gonna skin him.
[306:14.02]This is the dumbest thing you've tried to do so far.
[306:23.03]I just wanted to skin him.
[306:34.69]The pig wants the horse.
[306:41.40]Sorry, I was trying to make the game more interesting.
[306:44.56]We've been herding cattle and hunting fucking just deer for an hour.
[306:54.79]Another random chest, that's cool.
[306:57.65]What's in it?
[307:05.59]Okay.
[307:12.70]Clipping through the fence is just as good as actually using it, so that's good We looking at old man There's some mustangs and some such out there beyond that ridge Wondering if it's worth getting you and going around some of them up no Fair enough Nearly out of money Ranch is in turmoil
[307:37.25]We may not make it through the winter.
[307:38.51]What could we possibly want with some good quality horses?
[307:40.81]I'm not uninterested in it.
[307:43.18]Obviously, herding is a herding mission.
[307:55.20]I'll give you a bad case of someone just shot me in the head if you don't hurry up.
[308:00.39]I've threatened this guy like four times now.
[308:04.01]Are you going to man up, kid?
[308:13.81]That hurt.
[308:14.49]Nah, I'm gonna do this one quick.
[308:25.31]Alright, uncle!
[308:26.09]Bring us there!
[308:26.75]Is this actually another herding mission?
[308:43.54]That's about all you're good for apart from bending your elbow.
[308:46.59]I can't do right for doing wrong.
[308:49.19]You're an ungrateful bastard, you know.
[308:51.25]I did my best when you was gone.
[308:53.71]Your best is like anybody else's worst.
[308:56.27]Come on.
[308:57.57]Getting old.
[308:59.17]He's chasing us now.
[309:01.05]You've been taking things easy for 40 years.
[309:04.54]I think he's got a beeline on Uncle.
[309:12.02]No, he gave up.
[309:20.37]Give me this wild horse.
[309:24.39]Come here.
[309:26.37]I'm gonna do this mini-game again.
[309:27.47]Did I not do that right?
[309:30.33]We'll try it again.
[309:31.13]I haven't done this in like 17 hours.
[309:33.01]It's been so long since I've had to do one of these missions.
[310:05.97]Come here.
[310:08.05]Oh my fucking god.
[310:10.09]Don't make me drop a letter grade on this game because of the end of the game.
[310:13.29]Don't make me do it, Rockstar.
[310:14.39]I will.
[310:16.15]Let's go.
[310:17.67]Ow, damn it.
[310:18.65]Don't make me drop a fucking entire letter grade because of this shit.
[310:21.75]I'll do it.
[310:27.01]Hold tight now.
[310:29.12]It's alright.
[310:30.82]This don't feel too good.
[310:32.24]Alright, John.
[310:33.74]This don't bode well.
[310:42.11]You, it's the... I haven't... How do you do this?
[310:47.38]I didn't do this.
[310:48.30]I did it at the fucking very beginning.
[310:52.14]It's whatever arm he's holding up, you push the opposite side, right?
[310:56.94]So if he's leaning, if his arm is up on the left, I have to move right, right?
[311:00.82]That's what I was doing.
[311:17.22]Get on.
[311:18.66]Relax now.
[311:20.46]Come on, baby.
[311:21.98]Calm down.
[311:24.76]Calm it down.
[311:30.46]Just fucking get on it.
[311:35.13]Don't fall off.
[311:38.95]Show it who's boss.
[311:40.43]Easy.
[311:49.42]Can I be done?
[311:49.91]I have to do it again.
[311:53.73]I have to get another one.
[311:56.67]Don't fall off.
[311:57.69]I was gonna say, that would be so... If I, like, failed that for some reason...
[312:20.13]Fine, I'll get this one.
[312:21.11]The one that walked right in front of me.
[312:27.00]Am I gonna have to do this a third time?
[312:36.14]I really hope not.
[312:51.91]Get it!
[312:52.43]Alright, come take this one.
[313:01.63]Done, right?
[313:03.81]We can go home?
[313:05.74]Oh, damn it.
[313:24.18]Let's get this one.
[313:28.14]No.
[313:31.71]This one.
[313:35.95]I almost just started, but it's okay.
[313:41.96]This one's way more wild than the other ones were.
[313:56.05]Oh, he's a wild one.
[313:56.97]He's a wild one.
[313:57.89]Why do we have to get, like, five of these fucking things?
[314:15.46]Come on!
[314:16.30]Get on him!
[314:17.76]Get on him!
[314:24.23]That's it, right?
[314:24.95]Let's get him to the end.
[314:26.97]Good, good, good, good, good.
[314:28.03]Fantastic.
[314:30.96]Join with the ranch.
[314:36.60]Quickly.
[314:39.91]You got Metal Gear Solid 4.
[314:40.89]Why are we talking about Metal Gear Solid 4?
[314:47.42]Make sure there's enough fresh hay.
[314:49.46]We need to keep them strong.
[314:51.24]Alright.
[314:52.22]Damn, a little gratitude wouldn't kill you.
[314:54.54]Now for another herding mission.
[314:56.70]Oh, I would laugh.
[314:58.48]If there was another herding mission.
[314:59.66]Not a bad day's work.
[315:04.31]If I have to herd another fucking group... I'm gonna be upset.
[315:19.23]Alright, son.
[315:22.03]What do you got for the end of the game?
[315:23.71]What do you got for the end of Red Dead Redemption?
[315:30.53]Let's just go to bed and wake up.
[315:39.07]I'm gonna have to hurt everybody too.
[315:42.83]I hit gunfire.
[315:43.48]I think it's my psycho son shooting birds again or something, whatever.
[315:56.39]Farmer's life is a busy one.
[316:00.81]Okay, he's not out there.
[316:04.21]Let's make pancakes for the family, right?
[316:15.00]Mostly lost.
[316:15.58]Thank you for the $3.42.
[316:16.46]They're going to dig up Jerma craft videos and use them as the typical example of 2010 YouTubers.
[316:26.38]I would be okay with that.
[316:31.02]Still nothing.
[316:34.96]This is not on PC.
[316:39.56]Wait.
[316:42.14]Is he out?
[316:43.94]What just... What the fuck?
[316:49.97]Wasn't it just dark outside?
[316:51.25]I didn't do anything there.
[316:52.23]That was really weird.
[316:55.87]I hit cancel.
[316:58.09]And it became completely light up.
[316:59.81]It was really strange.
[317:08.90]Wolves, dogs, and sons.
[317:16.61]You're tensing up.
[317:17.83]Time passes even if you don't save it.
[317:22.07]You are.
[317:22.81]Your back's tense and it's making the rifle jump.
[317:28.87]You're holding it wrong.
[317:29.63]Here, let me show you.
[317:30.37]I don't need you to show me, Paul.
[317:31.85]I guess not.
[317:34.95]Lowercase j, thanks for the bits.
[317:36.15]Run off again or something.
[317:37.73]Better I teach myself.
[317:39.05]Why is he sounding defiant to me right now?
[317:41.87]What did I do?
[317:42.49]Whatever you say, Paul.
[317:44.15]Don't be like that.
[317:45.41]Sorry.
[317:51.54]Wolf's been after the herd.
[317:53.14]Gotta get out there and scare him off.
[317:54.40]You wanna come with me?
[317:55.24]No.
[317:56.18]Safer with two.
[317:57.42]No.
[317:58.42]Okay.
[318:04.85]No.
[318:07.57]No, don't do it.
[318:09.33]Don't do it.
[318:10.37]Alright, dog.
[318:17.25]Take us back.
[318:21.72]We're so close to the very end of the game.
[318:23.34]I can smell it.
[318:24.26]I can feel it.
[318:27.68]As you are, kid.
[318:28.64]That was a pretty sick jump, son.
[318:29.86]He just ran into a tree.
[318:30.74]He just went right into the tree.
[318:57.64]Dog go first You're gonna land us both in the dirt.
[319:01.82]I'm sorry Paul.
[319:03.38]You don't need to be I don't mean to be moody.
[319:06.18]I'm glad you're home.
[319:07.20]I really am another hour in no way I don't believe that I swear if it was down to me.
[319:14.34]He's the only mission that's available anywhere something we're gonna do this something's gonna happen, and then I'm gonna have to Do the end again?
[319:20.97]Yeah, I know all my machine guns Just some things you start have to be finished
[319:31.59]It's interesting how we go from desert to snow extremely quickly.
[319:36.47]Look at all this snow.
[319:40.57]It was just 96 degrees, like a quarter of a mile down the road.
[319:45.62]This is Minecraft.
[319:46.72]It's a fucking weird biome we're in.
[319:51.56]Let's go
[320:21.88]What do we got for a gun?
[320:26.88]Shoot the wolves.
[320:35.82]How many wolves are there?
[320:36.70]There's one more over there.
[320:39.47]We did it!
[320:48.83]What?
[320:49.17]What am I doing?
[320:50.43]Don't we have to collect them?
[320:53.73]There's more wolves this year.
[321:05.19]Huh?
[321:05.63]Why are they this far away?
[321:07.28]Didn't the dog have to, like, sniff them out?
[321:09.78]I'm surprised by this.
[321:12.78]This is...
[321:15.63]And this is when we fall off the fucking cliff.
[321:18.71]Thank God.
[321:20.87]Thank God we didn't.
[321:21.64]I'm gonna go back around this way.
[321:46.95]I just shoot my horse in the head.
[321:55.10]What's left?
[321:55.76]Another group?
[321:58.18]Nice work, Jack.
[321:58.86]Back to the house.
[322:00.34]We can sneak down this way, and... I have to pee really badly.
[322:04.92]So I'm going to pee, and then we're going to do this.
[322:26.87]He's yelling that from very far away.
[322:28.64]Let's go pee in the woods.
[322:30.32]No pee?
[322:30.88]I have to.
[322:32.90]I mean, after this mission here, right?
[322:35.04]Yeah.
[322:35.26]The one that I'm currently on.
[322:36.26]Whoa.
[322:36.44]That cut him off.
[322:37.00]Yeah.
[322:52.38]Even Jack just got scared right there.
[322:53.92]Oh, John.
[322:55.20]Jack and John is the same fucking name.
[322:56.78]Doesn't matter.
[322:58.54]You do too much reading, son.
[323:06.73]You're turned into a decent hunter, son.
[323:09.25]But try to stay out of trouble.
[323:22.66]And there it is.
[323:29.06]John.
[323:29.64]Jack.
[323:30.72]Jack John.
[323:33.72]Alright.
[323:35.24]I ended the game an honorable man.
[323:37.40]There's Jay again.
[323:39.84]Now go pee?

[323:47.46]I'll see y'all in a couple minutes.
[323:50.33]I gotta pee.
[325:56.35]Alright, let's get to the end of Red Dead Resurrection.
[326:09.48]Ah, scared you.
[326:10.14]Okay.
[326:11.50]Jay's not here.
[326:15.34]Chopping wood.
[326:17.44]Bunk.
[326:18.16]Cool.
[326:19.68]Nice work.
[326:22.22]What time is it?
[326:25.21]I got to go to bed.
[326:33.81]Time to go to bed.
[326:39.19]I'm not going to Molotov him.
[326:41.39]Sorry.
[326:46.81]The uncle might be a dick, but he doesn't deserve a Molotov in the head.
[326:55.98]Going back to bed.
[327:03.50]Not quite.
[327:05.00]Do it again.
[327:05.60]Right.
[327:11.13]Am I 78% bladder?
[327:14.27]I've peed two times in like six hours.
[327:27.24]That was fucking creepy.
[327:29.40]What time is it?
[327:32.85]Alright.
[327:39.56]Exactly.
[327:41.56]If you're sitting here, like, drinking a bunch of shit, I pee, like, if I'm taking a bunch of liquids.
[327:49.08]It's peeing, like, every three or four hours if you're just drinking coffee and shit.
[327:52.46]What are you talking about?
[328:01.27]John!
[328:02.36]John!
[328:03.16]What is it, old man?
[328:04.04]It's Jack.
[328:05.20]The kid.
[328:06.42]The kid.
[328:07.58]Well, I just saw him out in the valley.
[328:10.02]Seems your tales of hunting got the better of him.
[328:12.42]He said he was going up the pass track down that grizzly that's been seen up there.
[328:16.55]Kid can't hunt a grizzly?
[328:17.73]Thing will eat him alive.
[328:18.83]I know.
[328:19.49]Oh, no, not a bear mission.
[328:21.23]It all comes full circle.
[328:23.03]Damn you, old man.
[328:23.97]This is my son.
[328:25.50]Anything happens to him, you wish it was you that bear attacked.
[328:33.54]Get on your horse.
[328:35.41]Go get attacked by the bear.
[328:36.65]Let's go, Rufus.
[328:42.89]Take me to my son.
[328:49.09]That's it.
[328:50.01]Good boy.
[328:53.16]Let him get it from the front.
[328:56.88]That's moo.
[328:58.16]Paying is for plebs that haven't spent 10,000 lifetime happiness points on iron bladder.
[329:04.28]I think I should take out the shotgun?
[329:11.60]You want me to double barrel shotgun this?
[329:15.21]We got it.
[329:17.85]See, like, I listen to chat requests.
[329:19.97]Somebody said, shotgun?
[329:21.19]And I said, yeah, dude.
[329:28.32]What is it, Rufus?
[329:30.20]The uncle set me up.
[329:31.96]Is that what this is?
[329:34.06]He said that, oh no, Jack's got a bear, but somebody's killing Jack.
[329:38.01]You can find him, boy.
[329:39.39]And actually, it's some gang, or it's like the FBI or whatever.
[329:46.83]Slow up.
[329:53.07]Come on, Rufus.
[329:54.43]Find Jack.
[330:03.20]Oh, there's the bear.
[330:04.54]No, that's an elk.
[330:12.71]Where is he?
[330:13.25]Up in the snow area?
[330:20.95]This dog has a lot of stamina.
[330:22.63]Up in the bear cave.
[330:29.46]I'm going to have to fight a bunch of bears, aren't I?
[330:34.56]God.
[330:43.16]Oh, sorry.
[330:48.05]We're going up real high.
[330:50.69]This is dangerous for me.
[330:54.29]I don't do well on high cliffs.
[330:59.49]Yeah.
[331:08.15]Alright.
[331:16.57]Blood?
[331:19.07]Jack?
[331:20.83]Bear!
[331:23.85]Don't worry, I got this.
[331:26.37]At this point, I'm a bear expert.
[331:30.64]Just gonna have to Toro him.
[331:31.74]Gonna have to Matador him.
[331:33.56]Double barrel.
[331:35.88]Wait till he gets here and...
[331:39.53]Bingo.
[331:41.32]Told you guys I was a fucking bear expert at this point.
[331:46.16]You can't do shit.
[331:49.56]Mhm.
[332:15.53]So let's just go home.
[332:19.40]You alright?
[332:20.74]Yeah, I think so.
[332:22.96]You're lucky to be alive, you stupid boy.
[332:25.36]What did I tell you about going off by yourself?
[332:28.06]I go off by myself plenty.
[332:30.04]You just don't know... I'm sorry.
[332:35.33]I'm sorry.
[332:35.85]I'm sorry.
[332:36.21]I'm sorry.
[332:36.79]I'm sorry.
[332:37.53]Everybody knew it was going to happen.
[332:38.93]Everybody knew that was going to happen.
[332:40.25]Now hold tight.
[332:41.27]Why did he get off?
[332:44.25]Where are you going, Paul?
[332:48.64]I thought that was a cougar about to get him.
[332:50.23]Dog is still around.
[332:52.95]He knows he's gonna do that again.
[332:56.15]Oh shit, this guy's a psycho.
[332:58.61]I don't wanna get on that horse.
[333:00.31]There we go.
[333:00.83]Punch it!
[333:01.65]Let's do it.
[333:02.03]Back to the house.
[333:17.71]Why does it want me to go that way?
[333:19.41]Why would it want me to go all the way around?
[333:22.87]It's so stupid.
[333:23.75]Alright, almost there.
[333:44.47]Now the road comes out here.
[333:46.40]Watch out for Fantastic Mr. Fox.
[333:52.50]Going after a grizzly.
[333:53.68]He pulled out his gun.
[333:55.66]You've only been hurt twice.
[333:57.78]He pulled his gun out.
[334:00.66]I'm not a little kid anymore.
[334:02.00]What were you doing at my age?
[334:05.81]Oh, no.
[334:06.27]Dad, I fell off the horse.
[334:07.35]I thought I used my gun.
[334:09.85]Things nobody should do.
[334:11.59]But your ma and me, we didn't have one.
[334:14.30]Hey, like father, like son.
[334:15.44]We both have the same falling animation.
[334:17.72]I'm not asking you to be grateful.
[334:19.58]I'm asking you to do what I said before you get yourself killed.
[334:21.56]We both got Jerma suplexed.
[334:22.36]It was perfect.
[334:23.16]There's always one set of rules for you and another set for everybody else.
[334:27.23]You think I don't know what you did back in your old days?
[334:29.13]Alright, so, come on.
[334:29.83]Who ransacked the house while we were gone?
[334:32.39]I'm sorry I made you worry, Paul.
[334:35.29]Don't be too eager to grow up, son.
[334:37.61]Have as much fun as it looks.
[334:41.49]When you're ready to hunt bears, I'll take you.
[334:50.33]Make him walk the rest of the way.
[334:51.87]That doesn't sound like a very nice fatherly thing to do.
[334:57.59]Alright.
[334:58.31]Well, there he is.
[335:02.73]The last enemy that shall be destroyed.
[335:04.53]Hey, Jack.
[335:09.45]Hey, Paul.
[335:10.79]Need a hand with that?
[335:12.35]No, sir.
[335:12.71]I got it.
[335:15.11]Looks like you have.
[335:17.19]You know, you're real good with them tools.
[335:19.74]Why is my honor so low?
[335:22.42]What are you talking about?
[335:23.68]My honor's fairly high, I think, at least.
[335:26.19]Mm-hmm.
[335:50.18]Is it leather working?
[335:53.30]We should have some fun then.
[335:55.34]Is there anything you don't like shooting, Paul?
[335:57.22]I haven't met the thing yet, but as soon as I do, I'll let you know.
[336:02.56]You can even put it in one of them books you read.
[336:05.87]Maybe I'll do that.
[336:07.05]Today, John Marston stopped shooting.
[336:10.23]I ain't no literary man, but... I don't like him near that window.
[336:13.53]People like shooting in them things.
[336:15.53]I think you may be right there, Paul.
[336:18.97]I don't like the way he's sitting in that window.
[336:21.61]So, uh... You ever hear talk about them machines that... Grandpa's got... Oh, I thought Grandpa was holding a gun.
[336:27.50]I thought that was Grandpa holding, like, a rifle at me.
[336:29.54]You know they're gonna be bringing one of those machines around the country next year for demonstration?
[336:32.72]One of them machines can turn men into angels.
[336:35.20]One of them machines can turn men into angels.
[336:39.24]God, come here!
[336:48.38]Take a look at that.
[336:52.86]Jack, go into the house, lock all the doors.
[336:55.34]What is it?
[336:55.68]Whatever happens, don't come outside.
[336:57.28]You hear me?
[336:57.72]Whatever happens.
[336:59.08]Okay.
[337:00.31]Come here, son.
[337:03.41]It was a wagon with hay in it.
[337:04.41]Whatever happens, keep the doors locked and your mother inside.
[337:08.23]Promise me, son.
[337:09.03]What are they looking at?
[337:09.89]Promise me.
[337:11.25]Who is it, Pa?
[337:12.83]It's just some old friends.
[337:14.42]Me and Uncle take care of it.
[337:16.38]And you go inside and you keep the doors and the windows locked.
[337:19.44]What does he see?
[337:20.14]Then run!
[337:20.98]Yeah, run, boy.
[337:25.55]Well, old man, looks like things is about to get settled once and for all.
[337:30.35]So it seems.
[337:33.05]Come on!
[337:34.19]You best get that gun ready, old man.
[337:38.80]Take out the soldiers.
[337:41.52]You said this was over!
[337:55.21]Why are these guys all the ranger from Yogi Bear?
[338:03.84]What did we do?
[338:04.72]Steal a picnic basket?
[338:14.67]Hey, Uncle.
[338:16.07]Hey, Boo-Boo.
[338:17.23]I'm smarter than the average of bear.
[338:26.06]I win.
[338:26.90]Roll credits.
[338:42.51]You are actually the worst.
[338:46.07]It's all in good.
[338:46.67]We're just fucking around.
[338:47.53]Come on, man.
[338:49.07]Stay inside, you hear?
[338:51.38]Like I said, there'll be more coming.
[338:55.35]Funny how we got here.
[339:02.20]I don't know, sir.
[339:02.92]There's so many of them.
[339:23.00]It was probably for the scrape, by the way.
[339:30.46]That was a lot.
[339:32.22]Where'd they all go?
[339:44.67]They got Uncle!
[339:46.87]They shot Uncle!
[339:48.01]Uncle, you should not have stood up.
[339:49.55]That was a big mistake.
[340:00.58]Where's the last dude?
[340:09.03]Other side of the house!
[340:10.65]Sorry, Grandpa.
[340:16.14]I wish there was more I could do to save you.
[340:18.04]But there's not.
[340:33.70]Ooh, I'm taking hits.
[340:34.60]I'm taking a lot of hits.
[340:42.64]Uh, where's he going?
[340:49.32]Around the house.
[340:50.38]Alright.
[340:51.72]Join uncle.
[341:03.82]Don't die on me, Uncle.
[341:04.66]Come on.
[341:05.02]Hang in there, Uncle.
[341:06.22]I'm going to get you out of here safe.
[341:08.96]Ain't time, John.
[341:09.80]I ain't going to make it off this porch anyhow.
[341:13.65]Skin the Uncle.
[341:14.33]Take Jack and Abby.
[341:18.43]Take them and... Don't worry about me.
[341:22.31]Let's get them out of here.
[341:25.17]No!
[341:26.09]Uncle, please!
[341:27.54]He died real quick after saying that last word.
[341:29.68]Oh, my God!
[341:31.53]Okay.
[341:31.63]Take his gun.
[341:32.77]He's moving.
[342:02.28]His hand was just moving.
[342:06.22]No, maybe not.
[342:08.54]That door is seeing better days as well.
[342:11.22]We'll make a run for the barn.
[342:13.01]Stay close and keep your eyes open.
[342:41.66]Oh, one more.
[342:44.95]More than that.
[342:45.43]Two more.
[342:46.79]He's still alive?
[342:54.61]How?
[342:55.71]More other side?
[342:56.35]Cover your family on foot or from the silo.
[343:05.71]I wasn't in the head, come on.
[343:13.95]Bullshit.
[343:15.49]One more.
[343:19.06]Go, go, go!
[343:34.71]Oh, he got off his horse.
[343:36.55]They both got off though.
[343:37.33]No, he didn't.
[343:47.10]Go, family, go!
[343:58.83]Hello, family!
[344:06.36]Where are we off to?
[344:07.02]Into the barn?
[344:09.58]Into the outhouse?
[344:14.22]Lock ourselves in the barn.
[344:15.28]Come on, Mom.
[344:15.72]I have two sons?
[344:20.17]Is the big reveal I have a fucking twin?
[344:23.41]What's going on here?
[344:25.17]Who's the second son?
[344:34.95]You stay out of trouble, John.
[344:36.99]Ain't no trouble, Abigail.
[344:39.01]Ain't no trouble.
[344:41.73]Big reveal.
[344:42.45]John, I didn't tell you.
[344:44.05]You had a second twin son the whole time.
[344:46.25]His name's Jack.
[344:49.27]That was fucking creepy.
[344:54.64]His head like just... Oh, God.
[344:58.44]Dad.
[344:59.08]Yeah, that's the truth.
[345:08.85]Mom never told you.
[345:15.33]He's all bloody.
[345:19.38]Is he still there?
[345:20.06]Oh.
[345:29.31]Oh, hi guys.
[345:45.71]Oh, Jesus!
[346:04.77]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[346:07.86]Just wait for Red Dead Redemption 2 when I fucking get you.
[346:10.31]What?
[346:43.65]Wait, what?
[346:52.68]Did you hear that?
[346:54.10]Jack, we have to go back for Pa.
[346:57.22]Oh, now I play as the son.
[346:59.54]Go back to the farm.
[347:04.39]Alright, Red Dead Redemption 2, you're going to be playing as John Morstan.
[347:10.27]And by the way, look at this.
[347:10.89]The horse has no stamina bar.
[347:17.76]This horse is just as pissed off as we are.
[347:35.18]That's a prequel?
[347:38.04]Holy shit, that's terrible.
[347:44.02]No...
[347:49.85]Where's the second son very suspicious Where the coyotes wade
[348:19.71]How old was he?
[348:20.41]He was like 37?
[348:20.73]38?
[348:20.79]Not that much older than me.
[348:22.40]40 something?
[348:22.92]The term is 40.
[348:58.72]Where's the redemption?
[349:02.16]Wait, what?
[349:16.00]How did she die?
[349:20.84]She died three years later?
[349:29.45]What do I do?
[349:30.73]Wait, what's the other grape?
[349:31.99]There's a third grape.
[349:33.33]Who's this one?
[349:37.36]Uncle.
[349:40.08]Um... Okay, we have... John Marston.
[349:51.74]Abigail Marston.
[349:57.40]Uncle!
[349:58.82]What is he... Where's his name?
[350:08.78]So, I'm the son.
[350:11.58]Guys, Red Dead Redemption 2 is out right now.
[350:13.56]I'm playing it.
[350:15.74]What am I supposed to do?
[350:25.72]Should I...
[350:31.49]Is there anything I can do?
[350:32.83]Or do I just get to play, like, the rest of the game?
[350:34.55]Can I just go fucking murder that guy?
[350:48.73]That guy would be, like, that, they'd all be dead by now, wouldn't they?
[350:55.80]By the way, I forgot to tell you.
[350:57.74]After the fucking murder of his fucking father, John Marston became an outlaw.
[351:03.83]And he never took anybody's kindness in question.
[351:13.13]It's a different character, guys.
[351:21.52]I can play this a different way because it's a different character.
[351:23.88]So I can play a completely fucking different one.
[351:29.35]Get your Red Dead Redemption.
[351:30.85]Okay.
[351:42.44]Let's go get our Red Dead Redemption.
[351:50.50]Is this my redemption?
[351:55.68]Shut up.
[351:56.10]I have some fucking Red Deading to do.
[352:18.56]What am I looking for here?
[352:25.36]One of these strangers?
[352:43.17]Look at this.
[352:50.33]Get over there.
[352:50.87]No, fine.
[352:53.22]Just walk up the right window.
[352:55.84]Right door.
[352:56.68]Right stairs.
[352:59.02]Uh, who are you?
[353:03.27]You work with the government?
[353:04.89]You one of them agents?
[353:06.69]Sure, so why you ask?
[353:09.94]Did you work with a man named Edgar Ross?
[353:12.13]Purple question mark?
[353:14.19]Edgar Ross.
[353:15.59]No, but well knew of him.
[353:18.29]Fine man.
[353:18.89]Won himself a chest full of medals.
[353:21.95]This is the right one.
[353:23.05]I think he went and retired about a year ago.
[353:25.92]Last I heard, him and his wife moved out to a cabin on Lake Dawn, Julio.
[353:30.80]Lucky guy.
[353:31.44]Getting to take it easy.
[353:34.65]Thank you for the information, mister.
[353:41.42]Thank you, mister.
[353:44.88]Go find Edgar Ross' wife near Lake Don Julio.
[353:50.04]You bet I will.
[353:53.47]Lake Don Julio.
[354:00.23]Let's fast travel there.
[354:06.43]Get out of town, I'm gonna have to turn all the way around, aren't I?
[354:12.26]I could stagecoach, you couldn't know.
[354:13.50]Fuck it, let's just get out of town and fast travel.
[354:20.52]It's a hurting mission.
[354:24.92]I just, like, burped.
[354:26.16]That hurt.
[354:26.70]I was trying to suppress that too much and it went, like, down my esophagus.
[354:34.40]Okay, this is a good spot, Annie, I think, to get off the horse.
[354:46.85]I love how I took on my father's... I took my father's campfire stuff, I took all of his warhorses, I took everything.
[355:00.56]No, take...
[355:07.84]It's the purple?
[355:08.60]I don't know.
[355:10.08]It's been confirmed, right?
[355:11.98]It's not the purple one.
[355:20.60]It would be in his will?
[355:21.92]You think John Marston had a will?
[355:31.13]Here we go.
[355:33.17]Time to get my redemption.
[355:34.51]There he is.
[355:37.05]No, that's not the person in question, okay.
[355:40.83]Excuse me, ma'am.
[355:42.61]Hello, young man.
[355:43.33]Hi.
[355:45.05]What are you doing out here?
[355:46.74]Are you out visiting the lake with your family?
[355:49.32]No, ma'am.
[355:50.84]I was looking to deliver a letter to Edgar Ross.
[355:52.14]Shoot his entire family.
[355:54.70]That husband of mine.
[355:56.86]That bureau just won't get the challenge out of him, even though he's retired.
[356:02.34]Whoa, the fuck was that?
[356:22.13]Where is it?
[356:23.47]He and his brother went hunting on the south side of the San Luis River.
[356:26.93]What the fuck was that?
[356:28.33]Be careful crossing over.
[356:30.17]They were saying it was dangerous.
[356:32.15]It sure will, man.
[356:34.27]And don't worry about a thing.
[356:36.21]I'm sure your husband will be justified.
[356:39.64]That duck went right into the microphone.
[356:46.30]It took me a minute to fucking laugh about that.
[356:59.36]That actually hurt my fucking ears.
[357:03.76]Can I kill her?
[357:04.24]Okay, if I burn this lady alive, does that fail the mission?
[357:13.37]There's a perfectly placed lantern above her head.
[357:16.31]The mission's gonna fail?
[357:20.09]I don't know.
[357:21.21]I love how calm she is.
[357:24.47]No, don't.
[357:25.09]Yes, burn the witch.
[357:28.03]It's redemption.
[357:29.89]Kill her.
[357:30.37]Do it.
[357:30.79]Do it.
[357:31.19]No, don't.
[357:32.13]Don't do it.
[357:32.96]Kill her.
[357:33.34]Don't do it.
[357:33.84]Burn her.
[357:34.28]Don't do it.
[357:34.74]Do it!
[357:37.66]It's gonna fail the mission.
[357:39.16]No, I can't.
[357:39.76]I'm gonna have to start the whole thing over again.
[357:41.38]Don't worry, we'll come back.
[357:43.72]We'll get our fucking Red Dead dead reading rainbow red reading Red Dead Redemption.
[357:50.99]We'll get our fucking reading, Red Dead Rainbow reading connection, Red Dead Redemption renovations.
[358:01.50]It won't fail, it doesn't fail the mission.
[358:03.28]Don't fail the mission.
[358:04.80]It won't.
[358:07.97]It won't.
[358:08.41]It's, alright, fine.
[358:09.91]Here you go, guys.
[358:12.15]You ready for our fucking Red Dead Redemption?
[358:13.61]Red Dead Redemption.
[358:51.85]No.
[358:56.62]No, I don't want to do that again.
[358:58.86]I shouldn't have gone fucking back!
[359:02.56]Why did I go back?
[359:05.16]You guys all told me to go back.
[359:06.25]I shouldn't have fucking listened to anybody.
[359:07.77]I should have just gone on with the mission.
[359:10.11]Instead, I turn the fuck around and I end up falling into the goddamn ocean.
[359:15.89]Ugh.
[359:19.91]I had no control over the goddamn character.
[359:25.16]I skated off the cliff into the water.
[359:33.96]Anyways, thank you DubskiDude for the bits.
[359:36.44]You get a dollar specifically for that fail.
[359:38.32]Also, burn her.
[359:39.64]Free auto.
[359:40.38]What?
[359:41.76]Thank you.
[359:42.16]Breenland, thanks for the $2.50.
[359:45.27]There is a post-game section to do something in Blackwater, I believe.
[359:49.21]It's a short bit of closure, and I think that's what I'm doing right now, right?
[359:53.65]Cigarette Spaghetti gave $25 like 10 minutes ago.
[359:56.31]Ride to the river south of the Mexican border, Jerma.
[359:58.85]Find the fisherman.
[360:01.45]Well, maybe tomorrow.
[360:02.37]Maybe tomorrow.
[360:02.81]Like, I want to clean up the loose ends and end the actual game.
[360:05.81]That guy was going fast.
[360:11.00]Wait, did... Is that the la... Is that... This is different.
[360:20.99]Oh, this is him.
[360:23.01]Hey there, mister.
[360:24.39]How's the hunt?
[360:26.13]Pretty good, son.
[360:28.25]Got me a few rabbits...
[360:30.88]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[360:34.48]Oh.
[360:34.70]Ducks, huh?
[360:54.61]I'll be on my way home as soon as I deliver this message.
[360:57.44]Best be off then.
[360:58.60]Wake him up and take him to the train.
[360:59.68]Just don't get on his bad side.
[361:03.62]He's got a filthy temper.
[361:06.24]Quack, quack.
[361:08.08]I at least have to get rid of this guy, right?
[361:09.79]We have to make this... Go find Edgar.
[361:14.33]Can I burn this guy in the fire?
[361:16.69]Can I lasso him and just drag him and just cook him like a fucking person hot dog?
[361:30.09]Okay.
[361:30.53]Can he cook on the fire?
[361:34.65]Oh, that would suck so bad.
[361:38.55]Come on, get on that fire.
[361:41.07]There we go.
[361:51.22]That has to hurt.
[361:52.82]Why is he not burning?
[362:09.76]Fucking Red Dead Redemption!
[362:16.29]Where are we going?
[362:19.31]Right here.
[362:21.10]Alright, do you think I can fucking tomahawk this guy from across the whole map?
[362:29.53]He's down here, right?
[362:30.95]What do you think?
[362:35.94]Should I even give him a chance to speak his piece?
[362:38.48]Or should I just redemption him?
[362:48.22]You go ahead and you duck hunt.
[362:52.40]There he is.
[362:53.16]I gotta kill him, right?
[363:00.44]Let him talk?
[363:04.05]I should let him talk.
[363:05.51]Talk, talk, talk, talk.
[363:06.95]Okay.
[363:09.19]Alright, fine.
[363:09.89]We'll see what he has to say.
[363:13.05]Should I just, like, fucking show him up?
[363:14.31]Would it get bad, though?
[363:16.55]Like, should I just start shooting ducks?
[363:17.57]Like, and be like, oh, man, you suck.
[363:19.25]Excuse me.
[363:20.15]You Edgar Ross?
[363:22.93]Do I know you?
[363:24.77]Forgive me for starling you, sir.
[363:26.81]I have a message for you.
[363:28.97]My name is Jack Marston.
[363:31.43]You knew my father.
[363:36.88]I'm going to push him in the water and win.
[363:45.72]Stay right there.
[363:46.25]Let me push him in the water.
[363:49.79]You killed my father.
[363:52.33]Your father killed himself with the life he lived.
[363:55.75]You killed him.
[363:56.91]I saw you.
[363:58.11]You keep saying that.
[364:00.72]Right in the water.
[364:01.56]Okay, here we go.
[364:02.30]Pushing him in the water.
[364:03.74]Oh no, it's a duel.
[364:05.10]I can't just like have complete dishonor and just throw him in the water.
[364:31.64]Well... Fuck it!
[364:44.03]John Marston wins!
[364:57.27]I tried to shoot at the hand.
[364:59.41]We disarmed him and we killed him.
[365:01.07]Redeemed.
[365:06.21]Now we gotta go kill the wife.
[365:07.97]And then that's it.
[365:12.05]Nice job, Sean.
[365:14.55]Wait, do I get a chance?
[365:17.01]Red Dead Redemption.
[365:18.71]Thank you for playing.
[365:20.37]And that is it.
[365:21.59]That is the end of the game.
[365:22.31]Okay.
[365:28.42]Nice job, Steve Martin.
[365:32.94]Oh.
[365:35.55]Okay, well.
[365:37.80]Cool.
[365:38.54]So that was... Where was that?
[365:40.82]Where was she?
[365:43.60]Where was she?
[365:45.24]I don't remember.
[365:46.28]It was over here somewhere, right?
[365:49.66]It was like along the coast down here somewhere.
[365:51.87]I don't remember where she was.
[365:59.41]Lake?
[366:00.39]Right here, right?
[366:00.93]Yeah, it was like right here.
[366:09.25]Well, there's Red Dead Redemption.
[366:17.97]Loot him?
[366:18.97]What does he have?
[366:21.75]Is he still going to be here?
[366:22.69]I thought that was the end of the game.
[366:25.81]I don't know.
[366:29.48]Is his body still going to be standing here?
[366:31.46]Oh, God.
[366:35.34]I don't think I can loot him anymore.
[366:40.79]Uh... He's gone.
[366:51.21]Who cares?
[366:51.67]Whoa, what do they have on him?
[366:54.59]Like fucking six bucks?
[367:06.18]He has like four hundred dollars.
[367:07.76]Whatever.
[367:08.20]You think I need money anymore?
[367:12.57]It's been redeemed.
[367:13.59]We've had our redemption.
[367:15.27]I don't need any money.
[367:16.47]Okay, so we are here now.
[367:28.88]This is the house.
[367:30.24]Is she still there?
[367:32.90]She ain't even there anymore.
[367:36.68]Unless she's in the house.
[367:42.37]Nope.
[367:44.07]She's gone.
[367:53.34]After the redemption, it's fitting that we do that.
[367:57.84]Alright.
[368:00.62]Missed joke.
[368:02.16]It's okay.
[368:03.68]Alright, guys.
[368:05.02]There's Red Dead Redemption.
[368:06.93]The main story.
[368:11.47]She must have fallen in the water.
[368:13.40]With that, I'm going to bid you guys adieu.
[368:15.78]Been going for over six hours now.
[368:17.42]I am tired.
[368:19.38]Red Dead Redemption, the main campaign, the actual game, it was very good.
[368:24.57]I'm utterly impressed that this game came out nearly like 10 years ago now.
[368:32.19]Very, very good game.
[368:33.19]And we have to do one last thing.
[368:42.71]I have to tomahawk everybody in this room.
[368:49.22]Not just the one guy.
[368:50.12]That guy's got three tomahawks in him.
[369:04.68]Look at this poor guy.
[369:05.72]This guy's a witness too.
[369:08.12]Is he gonna make it?
[369:10.62]Ow!
[369:12.96]I've got these sticking out of my body.
[369:15.77]It hurts.
[369:17.27]It fucking hurts.
[369:19.39]That killed him.
[369:29.10]What?
[369:30.96]Oh, that was mine.
[369:31.66]Okay, I'm good.
[369:32.42]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[369:34.26]Goodnight.
[369:37.44]I will see you all tomorrow.
[369:40.87]Tomorrow...
[369:44.10]We're either going to do Undead Nightmare DLC.
[369:48.60]Or we might start The End is Nigh.
[369:50.88]I don't know.
[369:51.30]It depends.
[369:52.91]If I want to change up Red Dead, I might play The End is Nigh.
[369:56.17]We're going to do Undead Nightmare.
[369:58.39]Just not sure if I'll do it tomorrow.
[370:00.77]Anyways, Red Dead was fucking awesome.
[370:03.03]It is currently backwards compatible on the Xbox One.
[370:06.96]So if you have an Xbox One and you never played it, obviously highly suggest you do.
[370:12.42]Good night everybody.
[370:13.62]See you tomorrow.
[370:14.30]Much love.
[370:16.03]Good night.
[371:00.00]you
[371:34.86]you
[372:09.76]you
[372:44.72]I've been sitting here the whole time trying to get Blackjack so I could just scream Blackjack.
[372:53.87]It didn't happen.
[372:54.47]That's why it's still on.
[372:57.55]I tried.
[372:58.37]I've been playing fucking Blackjack for like the last fucking three minutes.
[373:01.87]I can't get Blackjack.
[373:02.83]I was trying to get Blackjack and come back and be like, Blackjack!
[373:08.10]Didn't work.
[373:11.20]So, uh, anyways, goodnight.
[373:13.54]Goodbye.
[373:15.05]Come on.
[373:15.35]One more try.
[373:15.87]Come on.
[373:16.95]Give me blackjack.
[373:17.61]I have to end the stream with a blackjack.
[373:18.73]Have to.
[373:19.03]No, it's not going to happen.
[373:21.43]Secret ending.
[373:25.41]Skip.
[373:28.53]Apparently, I won.
[373:31.57]I'm going to run out of chips.
[373:32.67]What have I got?
[373:35.57]Jack and an eight.
[373:36.13]No, that's not blackjack.
[373:38.35]Take my chips.
[373:42.05]Secret fucking end of the string.
[373:44.61]No, we didn't get blackjack.
[373:49.19]Alright, last hand.
[373:49.91]I don't even know what it is.
[373:50.71]Let's go.
[373:51.11]Blackjack.
[373:51.45]Alright, goodnight.
[373:55.60]See you tomorrow.
[373:56.90]Thank you, I'm gonna cut my losses.
