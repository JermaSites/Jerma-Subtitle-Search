[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.55]I was muted for a long time.
[00:02.64]Usually I don't take that long.
[00:05.24]I know that a lot of streamers on this platform... Sometimes... I don't know if a lot of people do... Like a 25 minute countdown or something.
[00:16.80]I couldn't do that.
[00:19.37]I just sit here and two or three minutes go by and I'm just like... I'm supposed to say something, right?
[00:27.95]I could never do like a 20 minute countdown to start the streams.
[00:32.32]He would get to 17 minutes and I would scream and press the unmute button and be like I'm guys I'm here.
[00:37.56]I haven't been.
[00:37.96]I've just been here for 15 straight minutes.
[00:43.04]He sounds different.
[00:44.94]I got a little bit of a nose bug.
[00:49.11]It'll clear up.
[00:55.33]Wasp.
[00:58.71]Here comes the end of the stream.
[01:00.27]No, what?
[01:02.35]That's not what's happening.
[01:05.23]I'm ready to play.
[01:12.05]End of the stream voice.
[01:13.85]And so, okay, first of all, I, somebody just clipped that.
[01:19.27]What?
[01:20.31]Why?
[01:21.95]What did I do there?
[01:29.03]Somebody just clipped whatever I just said.
[01:32.13]It was me.
[01:33.33]Why?
[01:35.53]He doesn't know.
[01:40.17]It's kind of funny, because I see in real time, when somebody takes a clip, it's like the whole thing on my dashboard.
[01:45.42]And I'm always, sometimes I get self-conscious, because I'll be like, blah blah blah, yadda yadda, I look over, new clip, and I'm just like, what happened?
[01:52.94]What did I do?
[01:54.48]Should I not have said that?
[01:55.46]Who are you sharing that with?
[02:03.23]How you guys doing?
[02:04.23]Hope you had a good relaxing couple of days.
[02:07.05]Hope you had some fun.
[02:08.73]Hope you did some things.
[02:09.93]Hope you were productive.
[02:10.79]Hopefully you were productive as well, you know.
[02:16.40]Today we're going to play Viscera Cleanup Detail because, you know, I just feel like cleaning shit up.
[02:23.20]I'm in the mood for Kenshi.
[02:25.71]Yeah, Kenji is a lot of fun.
[02:27.46]But I've been away from Viscera.
[02:29.02]I played it once and I had a shitload of fun, so I want to do it again.
[02:39.93]I just like cleaning things up sometimes.
[02:43.27]It's my guilty video game pleasure.
[02:47.35]House Flipper.
[02:48.69]Viscera cleanup detail.
[02:49.81]It's easy just to mop stuff up on the ground and talk about Chrono Trigger.
[02:55.36]You know what I mean?
[03:00.98]Anyways, I'll be right back.
[03:02.93]Give me two seconds.
[03:03.81]I just wanna make sure the game opens and doesn't crash.
[03:05.77]Be right back.
[03:13.94]It's not a guilty pleasure if you share it with 5,000 people.
[03:16.98]What?
[03:19.20]That could be a guilty pleasure still.
[03:28.06]Okay, how is that not still a guilty pleasure?
[03:29.84]Alright, you know, whatever.
[03:30.99]Be right back.
[03:39.96]Like, if I robbed a bank on stream, that would be guilty.
[03:42.66]That'd be a guilty pleasure, right?
[03:44.32]Like, I'm gonna go to jail.
[04:07.11]Alright, we're good.
[04:08.67]No, that's not what I'm talking about.
[04:09.65]You guys know I'm talking about like in Grand Theft Auto 5 when you do a heist with your friends.
[04:14.20]I would go to the in-game video game jail.
[04:17.30]Context.
[04:17.80]You gotta have the context.
[04:19.82]Otherwise, what the hell does that mean?
[04:26.56]Gotta do Revengeance DLC.
[04:28.12]Yeah, there's a lot of things to do.
[04:33.58]I like cleaning by myself.
[04:35.14]I don't like other people cleaning with me.
[04:38.95]I don't want someone to clean my room with me, because what if they find like the dirty underwear and the crushed up fucking Hot Pocket wrappers.
[04:48.21]No, that's my- it's a guilty pleasure of mine.
[04:52.02]Hot Pockets, you know?
[04:53.48]They're disgusting.
[04:54.14]I haven't eaten one in probably four years.
[04:55.58]Don't take that as an endorsement.
[05:00.26]Uh, save file.
[05:01.00]I don't have any on this one.
[05:02.06]Okay, we're gonna do clean up.
[05:05.36]So now we get to pick.
[05:07.55]Which one of these should I do today?
[05:15.89]One hour, one hour, two hours and 30 minutes.
[05:18.87]Evil science looks kind of cool.
[05:22.77]Zero G therapy.
[05:31.54]Incubation emergency.
[05:36.80]Up rinsing.
[05:40.49]Do a straw poll?
[05:41.35]This is so... There are too many things to choose from.
[05:44.67]I can't do a straw poll for this.
[05:45.99]This will take like 30 minutes to write all these.
[05:50.77]I think, uh, Evil Science seems like kind of fun.
[05:56.29]Either that or... What is this one?
[06:01.61]Penumbra?
[06:04.41]Ice Moon Research Outpost?
[06:09.23]Smart click?
[06:09.87]Smart click ain't going to work here.
[06:15.59]Don't let dumb chat choose for you.
[06:19.17]Look, these only take like two hours.
[06:20.47]Okay, I'm going to get through.
[06:21.51]Look, I know how to play now.
[06:23.78]I'm going to do evil science.
[06:25.50]The two hours and 30 minutes add like two hours of germa time.
[06:28.22]So it's going to be like four hours and 30 minutes.
[06:31.68]And then I could do another one that's like an hour, which is like add plus one hour of time.
[06:38.08]Yeah, I could do two.
[06:40.73]Evil Science.
[06:43.59]Let's see if I can get this done in like three hours.
[06:45.23]I think I can.
[06:49.61]Worksite.
[06:50.13]Game rules.
[06:51.69]Foot... No, we're going to keep it here.
[06:54.33]Time limit.
[06:57.19]What is that?
[06:58.91]300 minutes?
[07:03.09]No, no time limit.
[07:04.49]That'll get... That'll fuck me up.
[07:08.94]I'll get to the end and it'll really- it'll get under my skin so much.
[07:13.58]Disable the sniffer?
[07:14.44]No, keep the sniff.
[07:15.14]I want that.
[07:15.92]Footprints, that's fine.
[07:16.98]I can't make mistakes.
[07:20.85]I'm ready.
[07:24.15]Start work.
[07:27.95]Why are we still not playing big- what?
[07:34.01]What?
[07:35.05]What is that?
[07:35.61]What word did you just say?
[07:42.27]Okay, we're gonna start work.
[07:47.72]I'm gonna do it until my hands burn!
[07:49.24]I'm gonna do this until my hands burn!
[07:51.32]Ow!
[07:51.66]Okay.
[07:55.64]Name, janitor.
[07:56.48]Age, 25.
[07:57.40]Junior executive janitor, given the nature of the janitor work that was carried out within the last facility.
[08:02.16]Your absolute discretion is paramount.
[08:04.07]Didn't I have a computer and shit on another save file?
[08:09.30]Federation representatives will be arriving in a week, and it is imperative that the facility be cleaned and organized before said time.
[08:15.54]Failure to perform your duties within company protocol on time will result in immediate termination.
[08:21.29]You are most assuredly an expendable piece within an organization, so it is in your best interest to conduct yourself admirably.
[08:29.84]Be absolutely certain that the facility is spotless, guaranteed hygienic, and in working order.
[08:35.52]Alright.
[08:37.42]Welcome back to Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[08:40.10]My name is Jerma985.
[08:41.82]Let's get this party started!
[08:43.08]Uh, where do I go?
[08:46.79]Let's take a look first.
[08:52.01]Is it aliens in here?
[08:55.61]Hold on, let's take a look.
[08:56.39]It's a big hallway.
[08:57.41]I'm gonna get lost in here.
[08:59.43]Doesn't look too bad.
[09:01.54]Big hallway leading down to... Uh...
[09:11.31]I can always tell when I'm really mouth open, have no idea, I just did like the butt head.
[09:19.35]So these are all locked.
[09:21.78]Am I gonna have to get... Alright, I just need to look first.
[09:29.36]Shave us.
[09:30.28]Okay.
[09:31.64]Well, maybe you should buy yourself a Norelco.
[09:36.41]Let's get some music on here!
[09:39.25]What?
[09:39.63]Oh.
[09:44.05]How do you pick items up again?
[09:45.31]E?
[09:45.35]Oh, right.
[09:52.78]I need the hands.
[09:55.16]And then there's a way to... Whoops.
[09:59.64]Is it shift?
[10:00.94]Z?
[10:01.98]Alt?
[10:02.98]Right click?
[10:04.28]Hold?
[10:04.68]Left click?
[10:05.11]There it is.
[10:10.36]Like that.
[10:13.04]Okay.
[10:13.45]What's on the music file here?
[10:20.21]Oh, that's right.
[10:20.71]I turned it all off because we were listening to Chrono Trigger.
[10:25.76]What's the music on this one?
[10:31.04]Uh, I ain't listening to that for like three hours.
[10:41.27]Okay.
[10:43.35]That's alright.
[10:44.13]That's what I'm looking for.
[10:44.95]Those are both the same song.
[10:51.82]That's too intense for me.
[10:53.80]I need something less intense.
[11:00.30]No, that's too quirky for me.
[11:05.55]I don't like the generic Casio keyboard drum beat.
[11:10.48]No.
[11:12.64]Alright, sounds alright.
[11:16.30]No.
[11:17.82]No.
[11:19.79]Skunk's in the machine.
[11:22.51]No.
[11:24.15]No.
[11:25.21]No.
[11:26.13]No.
[11:27.09]No.
[11:27.81]No.
[11:28.45]No.
[11:29.07]No.
[11:29.23]I think I want this one.
[11:35.31]Alright, let's take a look.
[11:35.95]We got a lot of ground to cover.
[11:41.01]There's a lot of ground to cover.
[11:46.31]Upper level.
[11:47.09]Is this an elevator?
[11:50.72]No, it's not.
[11:51.56]How big is this?
[12:00.00]Oh my god, this is gonna take me like 12 hours.
[12:04.01]Look at this mess.
[12:07.63]And there's multiple locked doors.
[12:12.37]Okay, I'm gonna start up top.
[12:26.26]Yeah, I'm gonna start up top.
[12:27.64]Because then I'm gonna work my way down.
[12:30.86]Where do we get water in this one?
[12:32.10]The other one had elves in it, and there was a funny elf machine.
[12:36.25]Do I have to bring buckets upstairs for this shit?
[12:47.56]Alright, I'm ready.
[12:48.62]No, I'm not ready.
[12:49.34]I'm so overwhelmed right now.
[12:50.56]Go out.
[12:51.04]Outside and down.
[12:59.27]Okay, here is a trash machine.
[13:01.21]Let's just start in front of the elevator.
[13:03.89]I don't know what to do.
[13:05.39]This is what would happen in real life.
[13:08.01]If you walked into a scene like this, and you were told, alright, you gotta clean that up, you'd be like, okay.
[13:13.26]You wouldn't know where the fuck to start.
[13:18.70]Okay, let's go.
[13:19.38]I'm gonna start right in front.
[13:32.10]I need to tr... I'm so overwhelmed.
[13:34.34]I really am.
[13:35.10]This is like... Hey Jeremy, this is why you play with like five people.
[13:40.12]Not me.
[13:40.60]I need to clean alone.
[13:46.56]Alright, we made some progress.
[13:49.67]Lookit.
[13:50.67]We already made progress.
[13:51.66]I didn't even have to do anything.
[13:55.82]No, I have friends, but I don't... I like to clean alone.
[14:02.52]And plus, like, somebody would say, like, a funny joke, and I would miss it.
[14:07.95]I'd be too busy going like this.
[14:09.41]Oops.
[14:17.88]I have friends, but I don't.
[14:20.51]Oh, come on, man.
[14:21.15]I just moved to Vegas.
[14:22.11]I don't know anybody out here.
[14:27.58]How am I supposed to connect with my friends?
[14:28.96]I moved to Vegas.
[14:33.54]Wait, what?
[14:33.82]The internet?
[14:35.32]Oh, that's right.
[14:36.30]We're on the internet.
[14:37.88]I can just call them on the internet phone.
[14:43.30]I love this game.
[14:43.96]It really is so much fun just to do nothing.
[14:46.79]Does anybody else feel that way, too?
[14:52.05]Is it weird that... Remember we were talking about stuff... Hey, German, what would you do if you weren't, like, streaming?
[14:58.55]This.
[14:59.63]I would probably want to do this.
[15:06.60]Dude, I would... See what I'm talking about?
[15:08.30]I would just sit here.
[15:08.92]I would just put on the Joe Rogan podcast, man, and just, like, zone the fuck out.
[15:24.98]Damn it.
[15:27.26]I like this idea though, because then I'm going to make sure there's nothing on the ceiling.
[15:29.86]Nothing anywhere.
[15:30.34]Are you kidding me, man?
[15:38.52]I would just open up children's surprise egg videos on repeat while I just did this.
[15:46.11]It'd be amazing.
[15:56.70]Because I don't know man, like what's in that egg?
[15:59.99]Open it.
[16:00.27]Ah, it's a mini Spider-Man.
[16:04.37]Whoa, awesome.
[16:06.21]I didn't know it was in that egg.
[16:07.59]Could have been anything.
[16:09.76]What's in the next one?
[16:12.34]A Hatchimal.
[16:13.26]Oh, yeah.
[16:18.04]I've seen those before.
[16:29.31]Okay, what have we got?
[16:30.57]Binoculars?
[16:32.99]Can I look in them?
[16:37.35]No, I can't even... Fuck you lemon-lime binoculars!
[16:44.55]What's this?
[16:45.01]Biohazard material?
[16:53.68]Hey, you know I had one of these?
[16:54.60]No, no, no, not a bedpan.
[16:56.96]Not a bedpan.
[16:57.60]I had one of these.
[16:59.66]I owned one of these.
[17:06.53]Somebody just gave a shitload of subs.
[17:10.69]Jinzeebo just gave five community subs.
[17:12.41]Thank you.
[17:15.03]Thank you so much, Jinzeebo.
[17:17.91]Alright, now... Come on, I need to balance...
[17:21.77]Where's the fire for this thing?
[17:27.32]In the Christmas one, there was a big giant fire.
[17:29.42]Where's the giant fire?
[17:32.14]Is this a fire?
[17:33.80]If you are attacked or severely injured, please report to the nearest medical facility treatment.
[17:38.54]What do you mean, attacked?
[17:41.64]What the hell is this?
[17:43.20]Toilet seat pizza slicer?
[17:47.57]What?
[17:52.11]Why are they giving out toilet seats?
[18:01.24]Toilet seats?
[18:04.38]I got a feeling that I'm going to have to replace toilet seats.
[18:08.68]Okay, that's fine.
[18:09.36]No, I'm not tracking.
[18:10.38]Alright, we got this place almost clear.
[18:11.76]I need to... I need to find the big fire in the middle.
[18:15.28]I need to find where the Santa comes down.
[18:17.74]That looks like where Santa comes down.
[18:20.64]Oh, yeah, it is.
[18:23.93]Mm-hmm.
[18:25.67]Uh-huh.
[18:26.77]Mm-hmm.
[18:35.20]This guy's not still alive, is he?
[18:40.06]I don't know if I'd want to fuck with that guy.
[18:41.34]That guy had on one of the backpack super soakers.
[18:46.45]Remember you when you were a kid?
[18:48.40]You got in a Super Soaker fight.
[18:50.66]You got your... And then it stopped and the little P came forward.
[18:58.80]That motherfucker rolls up with the backpack on.
[19:04.78]You were all in trouble.
[19:10.26]What is it?
[19:11.04]Oh, that just scared the shit out of you.
[19:19.73]Alright, hold on.
[19:21.01]I gotta put the giant maggots in here.
[19:24.01]Are they gonna fit?
[19:30.49]That fits, right?
[19:31.39]Yeah.
[19:34.57]I'll come back later.
[19:39.56]I hate this music.
[19:40.52]Alright, we got some cells here.
[19:45.86]I really don't want to listen to this, but I'm going to.
[19:50.31]Holy shit.
[19:53.53]Is this an alien?
[19:58.36]Alright, I don't like that.
[19:59.38]I don't like that.
[20:05.76]I don't... The eyes!
[20:06.74]I don't know what's going on with the eyes.
[20:08.50]Those eyes!
[20:09.12]You know what I'm saying when I'm talking about the eyes?
[20:18.32]They're like perfect cartoon eyes.
[20:22.60]Alright, well... I found the incinerator.
[20:30.25]I don't... I don't like that one.
[20:35.55]Alright, so where was I?
[20:36.37]How much time has elapsed?
[20:38.39]21 minutes.
[20:39.87]Oh.
[20:40.57]Boy.
[20:42.90]I'm never gonna get this done in two hours.
[20:44.94]Yes I am.
[20:49.17]It's so big.
[20:50.69]What is this?
[20:52.63]A box?
[20:53.11]Okay, I can put some stuff in here.
[20:56.11]And then put this in the fire.
[21:00.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[21:01.24]Get... Alright.
[21:05.58]This is a whole nother... This is the exit?
[21:08.16]Yeah.
[21:10.06]I need to bring some barrels around here.
[21:12.18]We got shell casings everywhere.
[21:16.72]This was an FPS, that's for sure.
[21:21.26]One of the funnest, coolest parts about this game is just figuring it out.
[21:25.16]What is this?
[21:25.80]Is this an FPS or was this like an RTS or an RPG?
[21:28.60]It's really like this is an FPS.
[21:30.54]So cool.
[21:31.96]Fuck.
[21:32.20]All right, can you stop please?
[21:41.59]What?
[21:41.97]Why?
[21:43.45]Why?
[21:44.23]What?
[21:45.85]Why is this still happening?
[21:49.72]Okay, we're fine now, apparently.
[21:51.60]I need a bucket.
[22:00.25]We gotta go middle out, I think.
[22:01.53]There's no way I'm gonna walk across this whole time.
[22:05.93]Can I pick up the... Can I pick up the thing that generates... No, no, just start... I'm getting distracted.
[22:14.40]Stop getting distracted.
[22:17.93]Give me one of these.
[22:18.41]Give me like five of these.
[22:25.33]Does dynamite come out of this thing?
[22:27.95]What's the joke for this one?
[22:34.43]What's like the thing that pops out of here?
[22:39.26]I mean, so here's a joke right here.
[22:40.62]I mean, that's still kind of funny.
[22:49.65]Alright.
[22:51.29]Let's put this one back here.
[22:52.93]I don't got much to do over there.
[22:54.87]I gotta incinerate that.
[22:57.11]I gotta get a mental mapping of where that incinerator fucking is.
[23:03.98]Okay, mental map of where the incinerator is.
[23:05.82]Here we go.
[23:06.24]Ready?
[23:08.40]Straight.
[23:10.88]And then you take a right.
[23:12.26]Nope, you don't.
[23:13.22]Straight, then left.
[23:14.08]It's right there.
[23:14.68]I got a mental map now, mentally decoded into my brain.
[23:25.13]gonna leave it open why even just leave it open okay we gotta go from back here I'm gonna do this now all right get in there whoo toasty that wasn't even funny
[23:49.62]That wasn't even supposed to be funny.
[23:51.06]This was filling air.
[23:52.78]I was just filling dead air.
[23:59.49]Oh well.
[24:05.05]Okay, this has got to go too.
[24:13.62]Play the Super Mario Bros.
[24:15.06]OST RPG.
[24:16.66]No, no, that was Super Mario Bros.
[24:21.33]Alright, I'm ready.
[24:22.45]I need another one of these buckets.
[24:23.53]Not tracking.
[24:24.27]No, I'm not.
[24:25.99]Beautiful.
[24:26.69]Beautiful.
[24:32.01]Come on.
[24:32.27]Come up this way.
[24:33.65]What are you doing to me?
[24:35.09]Oh, by the way, does the audio sound better today?
[24:37.91]Am I a little louder today than I was a couple days ago?
[24:42.11]I should be.
[24:44.67]I boosted myself a little.
[24:45.71]I don't think this is going to fit in here.
[24:49.53]Is it going to fit in here?
[24:51.81]I think it's gonna exactly fit in here.
[25:06.56]Hey, it fits!
[25:07.70]Alright, good.
[25:11.88]Now I just need a few more buckets.
[25:13.40]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[25:15.62]Spill joke plus three.
[25:18.04]Yeah, go ahead, keep track of all the times that I spill.
[25:21.53]Do it.
[25:24.72]Because then we're going to go through and do some deductions.
[25:30.46]Why would I tell you to count in this chat?
[25:32.88]That's something we don't want people doing.
[25:40.31]Every time that channel meme has a chance to just go away, what do I do?
[25:47.31]What's the first thing that I say after about two weeks of that meme, people not doing it?
[25:51.12]That's my own fault.
[25:52.84]Is it gonna explode?
[25:53.86]No.
[26:08.60]I need some new buckets.
[26:10.12]I need none of these.
[26:19.19]Just put them in a pile over here so I can keep track of them.
[26:26.89]Literally no one was counting until you complained that everyone would count.
[26:30.53]Do you see the vicious cycle?
[26:33.15]It's me.
[26:33.85]It's my own fault.
[26:34.69]I'm the outlier here.
[26:38.70]I'm the issue here.
[26:40.66]It's not you guys counting, it's me!
[26:43.66]I'm the problem!
[26:48.41]Alright.
[26:49.51]No blood, no bullshit over here.
[26:51.69]This is pretty clean.
[26:52.53]Just make sure the rain is not alien goo, right?
[26:59.16]See, I'm the one that's counting.
[27:02.34]On you guys.
[27:05.64]To be good in chat.
[27:18.29]I can do it.
[27:20.77]Alright, get that out of here.
[27:22.27]We're almost done, guys.
[27:23.43]We're getting close.
[27:24.83]We're almost done with the entryway of the level, which is designed for an 11-year-old to do it.
[27:33.51]And no 11-year-old is playing this game.
[27:36.91]This is not like a game for kids.
[27:38.31]Why would I even make that comparison?
[27:41.97]No, like, 10-year-old is playing this.
[27:54.10]They are.
[27:54.56]No, they're not.
[27:59.74]There's only one game that a 10 year old is playing right now.
[28:07.09]Can you guess what it is?
[28:07.89]Ooh!
[28:18.09]Wait, what?
[28:18.77]Fortnite?
[28:20.31]Minecraft?
[28:20.97]What are you talking about?
[28:23.08]You guys are way off.
[28:27.65]Oh, that's not a computer.
[28:28.61]Wait, come on.
[28:29.23]It is a computer, though.
[28:34.83]Is this a computer?
[28:35.55]I need a computer.
[28:40.59]Is this the computer?
[28:44.89]Where's the computer where this goes?
[28:49.42]Over here?
[28:55.69]I don't know where these are going.
[29:04.70]What is that?
[29:06.60]Is it upstairs?
[29:07.22]It's probably in a different room.
[29:18.38]Got it!
[29:20.16]Nope, that's the elevator.
[29:22.20]Where's he gonna put it over here?
[29:25.41]It's where I spawned, though.
[29:33.40]I just can't believe nobody has said the game that every 10 year old is playing right now.
[29:41.45]I'll give you a hint.
[29:43.63]It's on a phone.
[29:57.30]Mafia City?
[30:00.14]What the hell is Mafia City?
[30:04.16]I've been asked again to reinforce the cell doors.
[30:05.96]I really don't see the point.
[30:06.84]They're strong enough.
[30:07.64]I mean, what could possibly get through those?
[30:09.14]I've got more important jobs anyways.
[30:11.78]Yeah.
[30:16.46]Mafia City.
[30:17.32]Did I play that, like, four years ago?
[30:20.72]I think I did.
[30:23.25]Isn't that one of those games I played?
[30:32.15]It's some stupid game.
[30:43.14]A sponsored mobile stream.
[30:47.34]Alright, I will guarantee you guys something.
[30:50.72]If there's ever a sponsored mobile game stream on this account, it's not me.
[30:56.82]It's not me, and somehow they've impersonated me.
[30:59.04]I don't know how...
[31:05.03]If you see that on this stream, if this is a sponsored mobile game stream, and I'm like, hey guys, what's going on?
[31:10.19]Welcome to the stream.
[31:10.93]I'm in trouble somewhere.
[31:18.20]I don't know.
[31:25.34]Who would sponsor you?
[31:29.18]That's a good question.
[31:34.53]PUBG mobile stream, but that was me on my own free will.
[31:38.50]That wasn't me sponsored to play that.
[31:40.08]Oh, I'm in trouble somewhere.
[31:45.90]It's up, the ruse is up.
[31:51.08]That was the last stream I ever did as me.
[31:57.92]Wait, I played PUBG willingly?
[31:59.54]I don't know, not really.
[32:02.30]Yeah, I did.
[32:03.02]What?
[32:03.80]I played PUBG on mobile for like 10 minutes.
[32:08.58]Because it was a joke.
[32:10.91]That doesn't count.
[32:11.57]Yeah, that doesn't count though.
[32:14.27]I played it on stream with you looking over my shoulder.
[32:17.33]It was almost best gaming moment of 2018.
[32:18.87]We all know that.
[32:23.25]I played an entire game and I won.
[32:29.55]Someone help him!
[32:37.16]Oh, there's dinosaur tracks!
[32:38.28]Gotta be careful!
[32:49.88]I got killed by bots?
[32:51.54]What do you mean, got killed by bots?
[32:52.90]I played one game and won!
[32:55.33]I got the chicken dinner!
[32:56.37]I didn't pla- I- I got- I played it once!
[33:08.48]You play with bots until level 5, and I was level 14 in that video.
[33:12.19]Go look at it!
[33:14.31]I know my username.
[33:15.31]It's like Aragorn or something.
[33:16.75]I did like a look at me Lord of the Rings thing when I was lying in bed.
[33:22.48]You can look that up.
[33:25.72]I was level 14.
[33:29.98]So I was playing with... Can I use this?
[33:35.01]What in the... Whoa, okay.
[33:39.13]Should I put... Should I hide this?
[33:45.47]Why would they give this to me?
[33:52.43]Are there monsters in this level?
[33:57.42]Uh, okay.
[33:58.32]Well, I need to make sure I know who this is.
[34:02.96]I'm gonna put this right next to the Slosh-o-matic.
[34:06.58]Because I will forget what that is halfway through this game.
[34:12.74]Alright, I'm not looking too bad over here.
[34:14.10]Except for right there.
[34:16.45]But I got it.
[34:16.91]Uh-oh.
[34:22.47]No, I got it.
[34:22.89]I'm fine.
[34:23.09]We're good.
[34:25.47]Fixes bullet holes.
[34:26.57]Okay.
[34:27.25]Okay!
[34:30.04]Thanks for the tip, man.
[34:32.68]Re-chat.
[34:33.42]Re-chat.
[34:33.96]I... I... I am!
[34:35.66]What?
[34:35.90]I've been reading this the whole time!
[34:38.00]I've been reading so much of the chatroom.
[34:44.33]Yeah, one would say I might be reading too much chat.
[34:47.75]So I'm gonna go on chat restriction.
[34:48.93]I'm not gonna look at chat for like a full two minutes.
[34:52.11]I promise.
[34:52.59]Okay.
[35:03.82]Alright.
[35:04.68]Looks good.
[35:08.78]This thing, I don't know what the hell this thing's for.
[35:10.66]I'm sure I'll find out.
[35:11.72]Somebody will be screaming at me.
[35:13.68]I'm gonna walk by the thing.
[35:17.30]I'm gonna walk by the toilet seat thing.
[35:18.86]Like four times.
[35:19.96]How do we look?
[35:26.89]Alright.
[35:27.71]This is not bad.
[35:28.53]Does this count as trash?
[35:32.55]It probably does.
[35:35.54]There's paint cans over there.
[35:37.48]Alright, hold on, let me clean this up.
[35:48.41]Alright, get rid of this.
[35:54.25]Mike, muted?
[35:54.75]Oh, he's reading chat again.
[35:57.37]It's been two minutes.
[36:02.15]Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.
[36:04.75]That's the one thing I read.
[36:05.75]The thing that I know is not real.
[36:07.17]The mic muted.
[36:10.39]That's the first thing I read.
[36:11.59]It's cause... Sometimes I look over and the chat's just sprinting by, so I have to pick something out and read it!
[36:18.15]Like for instance, somebody just said, say banana.
[36:25.44]Okay.
[36:33.71]Okay, looks good.
[36:34.65]Okay.
[36:35.09]Okay.
[36:35.55]Okay.
[36:35.99]Okay.
[36:36.27]Okay.
[36:36.77]Okay.
[36:37.24]Okay.
[36:37.66]Okay.
[36:40.76]Oh yeah, right.
[36:41.20]That's... Keep that there.
[36:44.04]Toilet seat.
[36:45.02]Uh, I don't need this.
[36:46.20]What is this stuff?
[36:48.54]Warning.
[36:49.12]Cryogenic storage.
[36:57.97]Okay.
[36:58.23]Okay.
[37:05.79]I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[37:07.31]It shouldn't.
[37:08.35]That's not even... I don't know why that's funny to me right now.
[37:18.04]If you're fast enough, you can read us all.
[37:19.76]Okay, sour, please.
[37:20.62]Burn gun, don't burn.
[37:21.52]No.
[37:21.84]Okay, cryogenic.
[37:22.68]Haha.
[37:23.22]Do tongue twisters while cleaning.
[37:24.24]Stop.
[37:24.80]German, you have no buttons.
[37:27.08]Okay, sorry.
[37:28.16]Got it.
[37:28.84]That's as much as I can do.
[37:31.11]Can't do any more than that.
[37:39.11]I'll take this down the hall.
[37:40.23]Alright, speaking of iPad music, that's iPad game music.
[37:50.39]I need something else.
[37:56.06]Is there monster noise?
[38:02.68]Doom OST.
[38:03.56]No, I'm never gonna play the Doom OST ever again.
[38:07.04]I've played the Doom OST more than anyone on this whole website.
[38:10.62]I could probably bet any amount of money.
[38:14.58]If you take a look at Twitch statistics somewhere, who has played the Doom soundtrack the most?
[38:21.33]On every, between every account.
[38:24.73]I would be probably up, I would have like a huge advantage already.
[38:35.92]German Mustard OST, what is that?
[38:44.26]Play the Persona 5 OST.
[38:46.56]No, alright, hold on a second here, guys.
[38:48.68]I need somebody to tell me this, because I... Did I ask this question already before?
[38:54.53]I think I may have asked this question before.
[38:56.97]What the fuck is Persona 5?
[38:59.59]Did I ask this?
[39:01.81]It's like a life simulator.
[39:07.73]I watched the trailer and I couldn't figure out what the game was.
[39:12.02]He's hitting balls in a batting cage.
[39:14.76]He's talking to somebody in a coffee shop.
[39:18.82]I don't know what the game is.
[39:25.48]It's a turn-based fighting game with social stuff.
[39:30.50]Because Persona 3 was a full-on
[39:35.08]turn-based RPG.
[39:37.22]Is that the same game?
[39:39.72]Is that the same, like, are they similar genres?
[39:42.34]Are they different?
[39:51.32]Persona 3 had social bits.
[39:58.20]Same game, but better.
[40:00.09]Oh.
[40:04.52]Get in there.
[40:07.12]Get in there.
[40:09.18]Why?
[40:09.80]What's in the way?
[40:11.14]There's nothing in the way.
[40:12.09]What?
[40:13.43]Get your body in there, okay?
[40:20.73]Mafia City OST.
[40:22.35]That's not gonna happen.
[40:27.33]Whoa, hold on a second.
[40:28.75]Medical?
[40:32.71]I don't really need to get rid of this.
[40:34.85]There's nothing wrong with it.
[40:43.42]You know, I would put on the Star Wars OST.
[40:47.02]But I'll probably go to prison.
[40:48.60]So, I can't do that, guys.
[40:50.08]Sorry.
[41:09.66]You know what would be, like, funny?
[41:10.96]Like, somebody play a, like, put a YouTube video up.
[41:14.62]Where you play... Oh, here's the, uh... Here's the full OST of... Star Wars!
[41:21.50]Just start with, like, the Empire Strikes Back music.
[41:23.58]The Empire music.
[41:25.58]And then intercut in the middle.
[41:27.29]Like a siren.
[41:29.13]That would be kind of funny.
[41:29.89]That would be, like, a really, really funny joke, I think.
[41:34.75]So it would be, like...
[41:36.54]That would be a bad joke.
[41:43.84]That's the worst joke of 2019.
[41:44.62]That's the worst joke in the last five years.
[41:48.36]That's the worst joke in the last 10 years.
[41:50.96]That's the worst thing I've ever said.
[41:52.76]Ever.
[41:53.08]And I mean ever.
[41:53.76]And I'm talking about in my life.
[41:59.62]In my whole fucking life.
[42:01.16]And 3,500 people just heard it.
[42:03.97]Oh, I just spit all over my mouth because in the middle of that, I was like, abort, this is not good, this is not funny.
[42:08.85]But my brain was like, no, just keep, just try to hash it out.
[42:12.31]Nope, that's the worst thing I've ever said.
[42:29.21]There was a... There was such a better way to do that, too.
[42:34.61]Ugh.
[42:34.73]Alright, I'm gonna, like, turn the stream off and turn it back on and pretend we just started.
[42:40.57]There's the whole package.
[42:54.66]I knew it was gonna be bad, too, but sometimes you gotta commit.
[42:59.93]You can tell that I was having conflicting opinions of it, too.
[43:04.09]After the first, like... You can hear my voice, like, stop and say something else.
[43:09.64]Change it.
[43:11.82]I didn't change the channel.
[43:12.56]I stayed on fucking QVC.
[43:17.12]What am I doing?! !
[43:35.36]No, no, hey!
[43:37.02]Alright, it's time to start it over.
[43:38.80]Hey everybody, welcome to the stream.
[43:40.30]I'm peeking the microphone right now.
[43:47.75]Did I just- have I been peeking?
[43:50.89]Who just gave money?
[43:54.65]Stormichu just gave $50.
[43:59.99]Thank you so much, Stormichu.
[44:04.10]Thank you so much for the $50.
[44:04.92]That's a lot of fucking money.
[44:36.81]No, I'm not doing the joke again.
[44:38.91]No.
[44:39.15]$50 start of the stream.
[44:45.20]Yeah.
[44:46.52]I'll say it.
[44:47.54]I'll say it again.
[44:51.20]Sometimes people come in here and they just drop fucking huge money.
[44:55.46]And, you know, it's been not even 45 minutes.
[44:59.62]Thank you.
[45:02.31]That's fucking ridiculous.
[45:03.99]Thank you.
[45:10.88]Weird flex?
[45:12.12]No, no, I'm saying that I can't believe it!
[45:23.97]You know what, it's been a few minutes, I'm starting to like it.
[45:26.23]I think I like that joke now.
[45:28.72]Yeah, don't delete this mod, keep it up.
[45:40.52]Mitchell just gave five community subs.
[45:42.18]Thank you so much, Mitchell.
[45:46.45]I'll pay $50 if you never make that joke ever again.
[45:49.65]Well, I can promise you that I'll never make that joke ever again.
[45:52.07]Why would I do that again?
[45:57.07]I'm not gonna double down on the embarrassing, fucking terrible, dumb, shitty joke I just made.
[46:01.67]It wasn't even a joke, it was me pretending I was watching a YouTube video, but there's no context there.
[46:06.11]I tried to give context in 10 seconds, and it just doesn't work like that.
[46:10.23]If I made that video, and played it on stream, that would be funny.
[46:13.41]That would be really funny, if I actually made that video, and like, put it- Hey, here's like an OST for Star Wars!
[46:22.48]Now that's funny.
[46:36.35]No, it's not.
[46:40.77]I think that's kind of funny.
[46:41.87]If I didn't say anything about it before... I think I'd get a few.
[46:48.36]I would get two L's and then a circle in the middle from some people in the chat, I think.
[46:54.57]Alright, this is looking good!
[46:57.27]I like this so far.
[46:59.53]Let's move this up.
[47:04.33]Put on some music.
[47:05.09]Alright, what are we going to put on for music?
[47:06.55]Let's get something good.
[47:08.11]Something that we can all hang out and enjoy.
[47:11.78]By the way, for every Doom OST I see in the chat, I'm going to repeat the siren joke a full cycle.
[47:28.19]Sometimes I forget.
[47:28.85]Oh yeah, people want me to embarrass myself sometimes.
[47:31.31]I forget about that.
[47:38.68]Put on Plock?
[47:40.78]Plock?
[47:41.40]O-S-T?
[47:42.42]What?
[47:44.02]Holy shit, that's like a decade ago.
[47:45.70]I remember Plock.
[47:48.22]Plock.
[47:48.92]O-S-T.
[47:53.81]This is an old one.
[47:56.81]This is the... You throw your limbs, right?
[48:11.47]Is that a good volume?
[48:12.69]I think so.
[48:22.15]That's rocky.
[48:22.73]This is just rocky.
[48:23.55]That's cool.
[48:24.01]I have a siren place!
[48:47.27]Uh... Wait, was that the intro?
[48:52.76]Can you recreate an acapella version of the song that you just heard?
[48:55.98]What?
[48:59.42]No, what?
[48:59.98]Pretty good Banjo-Kazooie song.
[49:08.92]I need that thing in here.
[49:42.81]How fucked up is it gonna be when they finally make Banjo-Kazooie 3 and it's fully voice acted and they ruin everything?
[49:52.04]No, no, no, no, don't pick up the torso.
[49:57.32]Banjo's gonna be fucking Chris Pratt.
[50:02.96]Oh, I needed that.
[50:09.10]Am I?
[50:09.45]No, I'm not tracking.
[50:15.92]Now I'll do Banjo-Kazooie.
[50:17.12]Yeah, I'll do Banjo-Kazooie OST.
[50:18.72]Get these limbs in here.
[50:34.27]Somebody got a, uh... Somebody got the rocket launcher in the other room.
[50:40.64]This guy is in a hundred pieces.
[50:46.56]I have you muted and I'm playing the Doom OST because you refuse to.
[50:51.86]Why?
[50:52.18]Why get... That's such a... That's such a passive-aggressive thing to say.
[51:04.67]Or is that regular aggressive?
[51:06.13]I don't know.
[51:09.09]Can I play Chungo OST?
[51:10.52]I don't know what that is.
[51:14.70]Like, I don't... Cronk, pull the lever.
[51:16.48]I don't know what that is.
[51:17.22]Like, I don't get it.
[51:17.78]Alright, I think this can fit in here.
[51:30.47]Now what do I do with this stinger?
[51:36.50]If that's too awkward, it's gonna go in by itself.
[51:42.60]Like that.
[51:46.33]Any more little bits?
[51:47.07]I'm gonna play this song at my wedding.
[52:01.80]And now introducing Mr. and Mrs. Elbertson!
[52:05.78]I'm gonna really fucking piss off my grandfather.
[52:29.01]What the hell?
[52:31.53]Unbelievable.
[52:32.35]What is this music?
[52:32.99]This is not Closing Time from Green Day.
[52:35.18]Oh, terrible wedding.
[52:45.70]Oh, this is dirty.
[52:51.12]No, they're not Closing Time.
[52:52.02]What's the Green Day song?
[52:56.64]What is that one?
[53:01.02]That one's called Good Riddance?
[53:11.60]No, no, no, it's called Time of Your Life, right?
[53:15.90]That's the one I'm talking about.
[53:23.23]Wait, actually maybe good riddance probably doesn't sound like a good song for a wedding.
[53:26.55]Good riddance?
[53:32.01]What's like the graduation one?
[53:33.73]No, it's closing time.
[53:36.62]That's the graduation, wedding, you did it, celebration song.
[53:40.28]Yeah, closing time.
[53:45.80]Graduation is good riddance.
[53:48.57]What?
[53:50.58]No, no, there's two different songs here.
[53:52.81]There's... And then there's... I'm sorry, this music started playing and it fucked up everything.
[54:11.80]It started playing that fucking alien music.
[54:20.70]The alien music really screwed that up.
[54:22.80]Didn't spell it.
[54:23.92]I win, I win, I win!
[54:25.27]I remember this level.
[54:54.31]JoJo Part 5 OST.
[54:57.29]Now, I'm not gonna play anything JoJo related on the stream.
[55:04.13]Ooh, that's bloody.
[55:10.77]Nothing to do about don't... Ooh.
[55:16.15]That is actually a really, really cool painting.
[55:21.31]Get a frame on that.
[55:22.35]Frame that up.
[55:22.97]One, two, three, four.
[55:26.19]Give it a good title and sell it.
[55:29.17]You'll make some fucking money.
[55:36.42]Really?
[55:44.82]Actually, I really do like the way that looks.
[55:46.38]That's my new desktop background.
[55:52.13]I said that really weirdly.
[55:53.35]Desktop background.
[56:05.10]Should've screenshot of that.
[56:06.30]Yeah, I know.
[56:07.30]Fuck.
[56:08.48]You're right.
[56:09.60]Fuck.
[56:19.56]Put on mother OST.
[56:20.90]Don't talk about my mother.
[56:36.62]I got a rhythm here.
[56:37.92]I got a... I got a... I got a... Great.
[56:47.53]Thanks.
[56:48.39]Thanks for nothing.
[56:51.11]The incinerator has two doors!
[56:52.99]Yeah, but then you're losing the... You have to have this one side closed, otherwise all the air and the oxygen gets all fucked up.
[57:00.82]You need to have... This doesn't make the fire too crazy.
[57:05.92]Two doors open, it lets all the oxygen out, and then the fire goes out.
[57:10.44]Have you guys ever been camping before?
[57:14.01]What do you think that accordion does?
[57:15.95]When you stick the accordion in and you go... The billow.
[57:26.88]I need to bring in some...
[57:43.20]You bring an incinerator with you when you're camping?
[57:48.26]Yeah, what are you gonna do with all the trash?
[57:57.32]What are you gonna do with all the fucking electronics, the iPods?
[58:01.91]All the takeout.
[58:03.93]What, you guys don't order Postmates to your tent?
[58:07.50]You're not doing it right.
[58:10.65]I forgot to get a bucket.
[58:23.26]Nice.
[58:24.46]Quake bunny hopping.
[58:47.22]That was an extreme spell joke.
[58:48.86]How's this for extreme?
[58:49.80]Alright.
[58:55.17]It's right here.
[58:55.57]We're good.
[59:06.75]Don't you guys understand?
[59:07.71]Here's the thing.
[59:08.82]A lot of people that are coming in going like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[59:11.16]What's wrong with this person?
[59:14.18]When I sit here and I get to just... I don't have to pay attention to anything.
[59:22.75]You know, this is just cleaning.
[59:23.73]We can just hang out and just talk shit.
[59:25.27]This is just what happens.
[59:35.78]My brain gets contained when I have to focus on something else.
[59:45.53]My hair is up in like a fucking bun when I'm streaming like a normal video game.
[59:50.13]My hair is down right now.
[60:06.57]Turn on the face cam?
[60:07.25]I don't have any clothes on, I can't do that.
[60:15.24]An achievement right there.
[60:19.78]How many more buckets do I need, do you think?
[60:24.38]At least put on the OST.
[60:25.50]I'm not going to put on a meme OST, guys.
[60:31.61]You want me to solidify myself in the he did it?
[60:37.71]No.
[60:39.07]I don't want to look over it and see he did it.
[60:42.38]Or no, sorry, we did it.
[60:43.82]Mm-mm.
[60:57.08]Get this f***ing out of here.
[60:58.12]Come here!
[61:09.46]Oh, do I need to do this?
[61:16.88]I'll get rid of the barrels too.
[61:17.79]I'm gonna- f*** it.
[61:18.11]I'm getting rid of everything.
[61:26.70]Yeah, what the fuck is in the way?
[61:29.85]Get in there!
[61:39.68]What?
[61:40.06]Oh.
[61:55.36]They're going out the other side.
[61:57.34]Ooh.
[62:01.04]Alright.
[62:01.22]The clock is almost up.
[62:05.34]Bring this over here.
[62:06.40]Just fucking whip it over there.
[62:07.78]No, don't.
[62:14.64]No?
[62:14.92]No blood?
[62:15.40]We're good.
[62:19.90]Mafia City OST.
[62:21.28]No, I haven't seen any good... I have not seen one good OST.
[62:27.76]You guys can do better than this.
[62:34.38]I know you can.
[62:43.57]Nier Automata.
[62:45.41]No, I don't want to do Nier Automata.
[62:48.09]I'd rather play it.
[62:50.30]I don't want to experience the music yet until I play it.
[63:03.33]Damn, this is dirty.
[63:07.65]Mother 3, you wanker.
[63:12.05]Easy.
[63:18.26]Easy.
[63:24.45]Gonna be puke again.
[63:25.33]Yeah, I knew it.
[63:26.27]Just store them over here.
[63:27.65]Alright, this should be enough.
[63:37.29]I'm really feeling this.
[63:48.36]No, I don't want to play any copywritten... I don't want to play any actual real copywritten music.
[63:54.82]I'm not gonna play Star Wars Did you guys understand that the Disney CEO has an alarm clock that just buzzes when somebody is watching or viewing Star Wars or listening to Star Wars music illegally
[64:26.27]And he has a speed dial.
[64:28.41]From one of the 5,000 lawyers.
[64:34.71]He doesn't even give a shit if it's the middle of the night.
[64:36.99]It could be 4 in the morning.
[64:38.01]Hey, hey!
[64:40.67]Who's watching Star Wars?
[64:46.50]His wife.
[64:47.74]She turns over and it's just like... Hold on, sorry, sweetie.
[64:53.22]Some dude's playing a soundtrack.
[65:08.89]Play the Celeste OST.
[65:10.51]Yeah, but I haven't played the Celeste game.
[65:20.07]I can't... You know what I mean?
[65:22.51]I need to know what it's like first.
[65:24.01]I have to experience it first.
[65:26.78]We gotta go with stuff that I've experienced.
[65:32.42]Spill Joke OST.
[65:35.63]Yeah, just cut together the three times, the two times I've played this game.
[65:40.30]And then use like one of those auto-tuners to every time I've spilled something.
[65:45.06]There you go.
[65:55.94]Play the storm wind entrance music.
[66:00.33]And I don't hate that one.
[66:02.65]I don't hate it.
[66:13.02]I haven't heard that song in a long time.
[66:22.77]I got a better idea.
[66:24.39]Why don't we play... WWF The Music Volume 2.
[66:29.51]That sounds like a pretty good idea.
[66:40.70]Oooh, don't break anything.
[66:44.05]Actually good?
[66:45.32]Uh, yeah.
[66:45.62]Alright, if a magician can do it, I can too.
[66:53.35]Apparently not.
[66:57.19]No, I just rolled that.
[66:58.33]No, open it!
[66:59.91]Open!
[67:07.86]We're going to play a game.
[67:08.48]We're going to play every WWF The Music volume.
[67:11.60]And we're going to see if I can tell you who it is.
[67:14.85]Just based on their entry music.
[67:20.95]Now I'm curious as to... Hold on.
[67:23.42]I just got... I just got an achievement for doing that.
[67:26.20]I need to see something here.
[67:28.20]Let me save this because if there's a... There might be a problem here.
[67:32.20]So I need to save this.
[67:37.13]That was Plock.
[67:38.07]That was pretty good.
[67:38.65]Everybody loves Plock.
[67:41.13]Alright, WWF The Music, Volume 1.
[67:45.01]Are you ready?
[67:50.43]Alright, let's see if I can get these all.
[67:58.77]Is it playing?
[68:06.58]Uh, this one's coming out of, like, one ear, so... Let's try another one.
[68:15.67]Okay.
[68:18.27]Let's see if I can figure all these out.
[68:22.57]This is the Undertaker.
[68:24.45]I already know it's the Undertaker.
[68:27.73]Already got it.
[68:34.27]And he goes...
[68:35.48]Told you.
[68:35.96]I miss old Undertaker.
[69:24.92]Give me a couple of these.
[69:34.22]I miss old Jerma.
[69:38.62]Do you though?
[69:39.44]Do you really?
[69:40.08]You miss Modern Warfare 3 and Minecraft and shpee?
[69:50.75]Be certain about this.
[69:54.02]No, don't make that, not funny
[70:22.53]Clean.
[70:23.88]Clean.
[70:25.50]Dirty.
[70:35.90]Ceiling not clean.
[70:37.24]I'll take care of that right now.
[70:57.96]No, close this side.
[70:58.78]I don't need it open.
[71:04.58]Yeah, this is before he had the rock music.
[71:08.02]This is original Undertaker.
[71:10.10]Paul Bearer.
[71:18.13]Oh no, don't.
[71:19.67]If you're in the chat right now, don't look at the chat.
[71:23.09]Don't even look at it.
[71:26.76]But I'm one for one right now.
[71:32.80]I wonder who's next.
[71:35.54]Stone Cold's going to be on here.
[71:36.54]The Rock's going to be on here.
[71:37.38]Volume 2.
[71:37.76]This is 1997?
[71:40.76]98?
[71:40.82]I wonder who else is on here.
[71:45.08]It's definitely going to be Stone Cold.
[71:51.69]Who's next?
[72:08.40]Alright, Stone Cold.
[72:17.15]I don't remember that part.
[72:24.78]I don't remember him saying that.
[72:25.96]That didn't even sound like Steve Austin.
[72:33.74]This shit's fucking loud.
[72:37.54]That's a little bit better.
[72:38.38]The decibel volume.
[72:40.10]This room is pretty much done.
[72:49.79]I gotta get up top there though, don't I?
[72:51.53]Because look, there's a spot I'm missing over there.
[72:54.55]I can get that.
[72:55.21]Watch this.
[73:04.33]When did he narrate this song?
[73:06.77]I don't remember that.
[73:08.20]No, I could.
[73:09.34]I think I could.
[73:10.12]I think I could take one full closed-fisted punch as hard as he could in the face.
[73:31.89]And then that would be it.
[73:32.81]I'd have to go to the hospital, but I think I could do it.
[73:41.79]Like I'm talking, he goes off the ropes as fast as he can.
[73:44.81]And double crow hop sprint punches me in the face as hard as he can.
[73:49.72]I think I could do it.
[73:50.50]What?
[74:02.09]How does that- why can I not be like you?
[74:09.25]What the fuck?
[74:10.79]Stop!
[74:19.38]Are we gonna get any more?
[74:20.72]Are we- hey, are we gonna get any more like pull the string on the back of the toy and give one of my four catchphrases?
[74:32.34]Got it.
[74:39.82]Fuck, is that enough?
[74:44.94]That's the bottom line.
[75:01.25]Yeah, that's when he actually had things he said.
[75:02.95]He didn't just go...
[75:04.91]WHAT?!
[75:06.75]WHAT?!
[75:07.03]I don't know who this is.
[75:17.94]Who is this?
[75:23.64]He's familiar, but I don't know who.
[75:28.35]It's not John Cena.
[75:29.29]John Cena wasn't even alive right now.
[75:33.41]John Cena was like four years old.
[75:43.48]Alright, almost done with this room.
[75:44.92]It looks very clean.
[75:45.78]Oh, fuck, there's knives.
[75:54.66]Shit.
[75:55.32]Can I reach this?
[76:01.05]Did I ruin that forever?
[76:01.89]No, I didn't, right?
[76:05.89]I got it.
[76:11.90]One little knife.
[76:17.64]That's matching up with the music.
[76:31.94]Looks pretty good.
[76:34.00]I'm almost happy with it, not quite.
[76:36.52]Is this a watch?
[76:37.75]That's a nice pocket watch.
[76:42.55]Did you know that I'm three years... I'm three years older than John Cena.
[76:50.96]John Cena is like 41, so I don't think that's correct.
[77:09.08]Three years older than John Cena.
[77:10.94]No.
[77:14.48]I know John Cena is older than me.
[77:18.14]Because you don't do the I'm in random Christmas movies with Mark Wahlberg unless your career is now turning into like you're older and you don't do what you used to do anymore.
[77:33.77]He's not like 32.
[77:49.63]He can still shoulder block the same way.
[77:54.29]What?
[77:55.51]I don't even know what that means.
[77:56.51]I haven't watched John Cena wrestle.
[78:00.49]I don't know what he... I don't even know what he looks like.
[78:04.89]If you had like seven John Cenas in a lineup, I don't know if I could figure out which one is the real John Cena.
[78:17.28]Bring this to the front.
[78:19.74]Alright, well that was... that was not John Cena.
[78:28.59]Is this, uh... Oh, who is this?
[78:30.67]This is, uh... Who the fuck is this?
[78:36.75]I think this is... Sable?
[78:43.63]Is it?
[78:48.27]It's like cat screams.
[78:52.10]Did I get it right?
[79:35.75]No!
[79:49.36]Nobody knows what I'm... I'm not listening for anything, so...
[80:13.27]Ugh, alright.
[80:16.90]I gotta compose myself here.
[80:18.40]I'm fucking losing my mind.
[80:19.54]Oh, look at all this trash!
[80:27.49]No, there's too much trash over here.
[80:29.23]Hold on.
[80:51.94]Oh, I don't even know what to say.
[80:53.58]I gotta flay the game.
[81:01.53]Oh, nobody.
[81:02.29]Don't even.
[81:03.21]Whatever.
[81:04.11]I'm flaying.
[81:08.53]Did I tip it?
[81:09.17]I did.
[81:09.49]Oops.
[81:13.59]Okay, well that was... I don't know who that was.
[81:18.51]I thought it was Sable.
[81:25.04]Uh, is this the Undertaker?
[81:25.80]No, this is the Undertaker's alter ego.
[81:27.36]Like, the Overtaker.
[81:30.02]And he's, like, nice.
[81:34.20]He's not like a demon.
[81:35.28]He's from heaven.
[81:39.24]Mustang Sally?
[81:41.65]What?
[81:41.87]I don't know.
[82:04.76]I don't know who the hell this is.
[82:08.28]This is the era that I watch the most, and I don't know who this is.
[82:18.89]So much copywritten music.
[82:21.03]I don't think anyone's gonna DMCA this.
[82:27.59]Who even has the rights to the music volume 2?
[82:30.59]The company's probably defunct at this point.
[82:37.99]This company probably went bankrupt in, like, 2004.
[82:40.07]WWE?
[82:50.54]Well, WWE licenses it out, but who... DMC... WWE doesn't DMCE claim...
[83:07.56]They do?
[83:08.06]This song goes on for... How long is this song?
[83:22.12]Okay.
[83:27.63]Well, let's turn that off then.
[83:40.24]Mother 3 OST?
[83:41.32]Nah.
[83:42.78]Nah.
[83:44.08]Uh, let's see.
[83:46.88]Jenga OST.
[83:48.04]I don't understand.
[83:48.46]Is that just like a family playing Jenga in the living room?
[83:56.46]Banjo-Kazooie.
[83:57.34]There it is.
[83:59.57]Absolutely.
[84:02.91]There it is.
[84:03.57]Full Banjo-Kazooie soundtrack.
[84:07.51]Do-do-do-do!
[84:13.73]Oops.
[84:16.13]Let's try that again.
[84:19.94]Let's try that again.
[84:21.22]Okay.
[84:44.13]Hey, let's do it, let's try it again!
[84:53.92]That's right.
[84:54.40]I thought the whole thing was on fire for a second.
[85:03.07]Microsoft hates fucking money so much.
[85:06.61]Where the fuck were they this generation?
[85:08.05]With another Banjo-Kazooie!
[85:09.43]They don't like to do anything but have crackdowns where you take five years
[85:15.90]REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD DRIVE HER OUT OF THE CAR IN THE LAST ONE!
[85:18.46]This one's a dummy.
[85:33.33]Haha!
[85:35.09]You shouldn't be haha-ing me!
[85:36.29]You should haha- Yeah, you should, actually.
[85:37.99]You should.
[85:48.24]Who cares?
[85:52.18]Honestly though, let's stop fucking talking for a second and talk.
[86:01.07]Microsoft buys Rare.
[86:03.79]They make a Lego Build Cars game for Banjo.
[86:09.99]Microsoft then teases a joke about Conker's bad fur day in Project Bankrupt Spark.
[86:17.70]Why?
[86:18.30]What happened?
[86:32.69]I don't understand.
[86:34.25]Why would you even buy rare?
[86:37.43]You have all these insanely amazing beloved licenses!
[86:43.94]And they've turned them into, like, serial characters!
[86:46.72]They don't- What have they done?
[86:49.30]Cage in the corner, cage in the corner, hold on.
[86:56.31]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[86:59.77]Because Microsoft hates fun.
[87:02.85]If there was a real Banjo-Kazooie 3 that came out, and it was actually just Banjo-Kazooie- And look, I'm not even- I'm not gonna tell you that.
[87:11.21]Oh my god, I love Banjo so much.
[87:12.89]I'm a huge Banjo fan.
[87:14.41]Not really.
[87:14.85]I mean, it was fun.
[87:16.27]It was really interesting for the time, but... Do you know how many people would buy that game just because it has the number three on it?
[87:24.40]That'd be probably the fastest selling console game in the last probably ten years.
[87:37.40]Can I get in here?
[87:41.63]No, it wouldn't?
[87:42.21]Are you sure about that?
[87:43.51]You know, I think you underestimate just how many people are starving for another game like that.
[87:50.61]They might not... They might be looking for rose-colored glasses there or whatever, right?
[88:00.26]Is he high?
[88:07.81]Me?
[88:08.09]Or Phil Spencer?
[88:16.76]Me?
[88:21.62]Both of you!
[88:30.51]I just got gnomed.
[88:36.29]I told you, you guys find it everywhere now.
[88:40.95]Anytime somebody says or makes an utterance of the word like, ooh-hoo-hoo,
[88:47.56]Or like, ooh, there's thousands of those instances.
[88:51.30]All right, this one's done.
[88:58.47]We've got a clean room here.
[88:59.99]At least I think so.
[89:02.09]I don't know if you're wrong, but just triple check and give me out the meter.
[89:10.61]Looks good, right?
[89:19.59]I don't like this anymore.
[89:26.31]What am I going to put on?
[89:36.76]Mario Kart 64.
[89:37.50]We need something that just sits in the background.
[89:44.37]Something easy that sits in the background that can be dropped to, like, minus 20 decibels.
[89:55.46]Rye Star.
[89:57.00]That's an old one.
[90:02.11]What is with you and decibels?
[90:03.43]That's how... DB, that's the termination... That's how you gauge how loud something is.
[90:09.75]Especially when you have audio editing over here.
[90:12.90]It's DB, decibels.
[90:15.08]Minus 5 dB.
[90:16.04]0 dB.
[90:17.34]Minus 50 dB.
[90:22.95]How about the PS4 background music?
[90:25.39]No, I feel too trippy.
[90:36.28]Audio is measured in volume.
[90:42.92]Well...
[90:46.65]Sound is measured in units called decibels, dB.
[90:49.29]The higher the decibel level, the louder the noise.
[90:51.53]On the decibel scale, the level increase of 10 means that a sound is actually 10 times more intense or powerful.
[90:56.74]It's the decibel scale.
[90:58.76]dB.
[91:00.74]Sound is measured in a unit called decibel.
[91:02.32]All right, Donkey Kong Country is good.
[91:15.85]That's good.
[91:16.25]Exists in the background.
[91:21.83]Well, actually!
[91:22.75]Hey, you gotta speak up, man.
[91:29.68]The decibels are low back here.
[91:38.82]Finally some real music, but the music's been fine.
[91:45.92]It's meters cubed?
[91:55.69]Louder, louder.
[91:56.51]Ah, fuck, it is too soft, isn't it?
[92:03.72]That's a good DB level.
[92:14.84]Alright, we've got an hour and 30 minutes.
[92:16.38]I'm like almost done.
[92:17.24]And then I'm gonna eat a whole pizza on stream.
[92:23.61]That's not gonna happen.
[92:30.67]Why is this thing broken?
[92:35.17]What's wrong with this thing?
[92:40.28]I just want to make sure I got everything over here.
[92:41.60]Yeah, I have to bring this bucket back here.
[92:46.02]There's no stray pieces in this room, right?
[92:48.60]I think it's good.
[92:50.20]Close that up.
[92:56.63]Still on the first floor?
[92:57.55]Yeah, I know.
[93:04.75]Perfect.
[93:05.83]Looks pretty good.
[93:18.39]Still up.
[93:19.15]There's one.
[93:19.69]There's still a protractor here.
[93:20.73]I think that's it though.
[93:24.87]That's it, right?
[93:26.31]Yeah.
[93:35.58]Good to go.
[93:36.64]Move on to the next room.
[93:43.72]Right here.
[93:44.18]Open it up.
[93:46.83]Alright.
[93:49.89]Let's go.
[93:59.85]Is there an incinerator in here?
[94:01.99]Do I have to actually bring the- all the way back?
[94:06.14]Oh, this is gonna suck.
[94:11.24]This is gonna be so horrible.
[94:12.40]I have to put them- I gotta bring a bunch of shit in here.
[94:19.24]Can I open this or something?
[94:24.91]What is this for?
[94:25.59]Whoa!
[94:38.83]Well, that's really useful.
[94:42.61]I could have used that.
[94:44.23]Wait, was this in the Santa level?
[94:45.45]I could have used that a thousand times.
[94:59.05]Really could have used that.
[94:59.85]Alright.
[95:02.11]I need a couple of these.
[95:04.59]I need a couple of these.
[95:07.57]And... Do I want to do this room?
[95:10.65]Yeah, I probably do.
[95:11.35]I'm going to bring three of these in here.
[95:12.67]Look at how much shit is in this.
[95:16.45]I got to fill every bucket.
[95:17.39]I need like five buckets.
[95:18.99]We're going to do this correct.
[95:23.70]Lake.
[95:24.18]Thank you, Lake Drinker, for the five community subs.
[95:27.54]Lake Drinker.
[95:45.58]I'll get- we can clean up- we can do the little cleanup later.
[95:55.01]Look left.
[95:56.07]Look left.
[95:56.83]I just- I gotta get this set up.
[95:59.47]Just give me a minute.
[96:01.83]This is- okay, I gotta designate this shit.
[96:05.10]This is for this corner.
[96:07.98]All these body parts need to go in these two.
[96:10.76]Should fit.
[96:22.70]Okay.
[96:24.48]Derma, your feet.
[96:27.54]I'm fine.
[96:29.02]I'm fine, I did it.
[96:29.80]Derma, this?
[96:32.13]You want to get rid of this?
[96:33.95]Look left.
[96:34.77]Oh, I... Oh, this is horrible.
[96:41.39]Oh, what have I done?
[96:43.27]Just throw them in here.
[96:44.21]I'll get them later.
[96:47.11]Take your socks off.
[96:49.40]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[97:08.29]There's another room on my left.
[97:12.95]Is there?
[97:13.23]Man, I know this room here.
[97:18.51]What's wrong with this room?
[97:21.85]Holy shit, that looks kinda crazy.
[97:23.03]Can I activate this?
[97:30.17]They don't come out of there, do they?
[97:34.79]Will those guys come out?
[97:49.10]Give me the gun.
[97:52.21]I'm not fucking around in there.
[97:59.55]Come on out.
[98:06.45]That's a display, they don't come out.
[98:10.83]Right?
[98:15.82]What the hell is this?
[98:19.10]The results are more than I could have hoped for.
[98:20.68]My creation is showing a great increased pain threshold and soon will be my crowning achievement, ultimate proof that I was right.
[98:26.40]This is the critical phase of the experiment, one I cannot afford to get wrong.
[98:29.81]His siblings grow restless now.
[98:31.21]I must tend to them.
[98:41.18]Okay.
[98:44.54]Ugh.
[98:46.74]I don't like this room.
[98:47.88]I really don't.
[98:49.00]That just scared me.
[98:49.62]I thought he got up.
[98:51.82]I thought he was going to just plock me right there.
[98:55.94]Okay, close this room up.
[98:57.30]Let's block it.
[98:57.78]I don't want anyone coming out.
[98:59.78]I need a gun.
[99:10.49]Somebody's saying, laser on bodies.
[99:13.59]Oh.
[99:19.91]Does that destroy them?
[99:22.77]Okay, turns into little meat chunks.
[99:26.76]That's very helpful.
[99:36.35]What happened?
[99:37.45]What happened?
[99:37.87]What happened?
[99:38.39]What's going on?
[99:38.81]What's the spell that's happening?
[99:48.53]I'm overheating the gun!
[99:49.47]I'm overheating the gun!
[99:50.29]I'm overheating the gun!
[99:52.17]Stop it!
[99:52.71]Relax!
[99:53.23]This is gonna be a really easy clean up though once these are all turned into like meat nuggets.
[100:12.72]Alright, cool.
[100:22.13]It's a bigger mess.
[100:24.37]No, it's not, it's fine.
[100:26.69]It'll be easier to clean up, trust me.
[100:42.60]Just cook the whole room.
[100:44.86]Okay.
[100:49.66]Now this room's ready.
[100:54.06]I can't move.
[100:54.44]I gotta... Okay.
[100:54.76]We're good.
[101:00.61]Give me a bucket.
[101:07.85]I'm cleaning my feet!
[101:11.94]What do you mean stop?
[101:12.52]What?
[101:12.68]I'm trying to just torch the whole room so I can, uh... Not have to just come in here and just go like this on the ground and the ceiling and everything would be good.
[101:29.45]Yeah, look at this.
[101:29.95]This is easy with these chunks.
[101:34.37]Take a bubble bath on stream.
[101:38.40]Uh, no.
[101:39.68]Sorry.
[101:41.76]Alright, I need an incinerator cube.
[101:51.33]I didn't knock it over.
[101:52.13]I knocked that over, but that doesn't count.
[102:00.93]See, this would probably hold it all.
[102:03.08]That's why I just torched the whole room.
[102:06.34]Because now I can probably fit 90% of these in the cube.
[102:10.68]And then just have to worry about this one cube.
[102:19.87]You want to take a bubble bath with clothes on.
[102:21.45]I've done that before.
[102:22.19]It burnt my skin, so I'm not doing it again.
[102:32.20]Watch out, don't knock it over.
[102:35.78]Okay.
[102:45.53]I'm gonna need quite a few more of these.
[102:48.69]But now at least I'm not gonna step on this.
[102:53.48]I love this game.
[102:56.36]So you wouldn't recommend taking a bubble bath with clothes on?
[102:59.28]No, probably not.
[103:08.44]It's too hot.
[103:09.08]One last staple.
[103:24.69]Okay.
[103:25.61]What's this do?
[103:31.64]I don't know what that did.
[103:42.12]I just, yeah, I don't get what that is.
[103:43.92]Alright, I need a new bucket.
[103:45.97]I need two or three buckets actually.
[103:51.37]Where's the bath video?
[103:53.45]Uh, the TF2 crates video.
[103:54.79]Yeah, I'm in the bath.
[103:58.55]That's the one, right?
[104:05.54]Does every room have a lever?
[104:07.77]Ooh, be careful here.
[104:09.27]I don't want to fuck this up.
[104:10.77]Is there a lever here?
[104:11.49]Okay, is this gonna... Okay, hold on.
[104:14.27]Does this open the tubes, and do the aliens come up?
[104:27.66]This turns on the saw.
[105:00.47]That doesn't do anything.
[105:03.95]I can't touch the saw.
[105:20.22]Well, okay.
[105:22.82]It's just for fun.
[105:25.68]Well, that was fun.
[105:26.82]You can have the saw spin around.
[105:30.77]This is some dense, dense dirt.
[105:33.95]Gonna take a little bit.
[105:35.95]Take a chunk.
[105:37.51]Get it in there.
[105:39.91]You know, I'm gonna get the chunks first.
[105:42.94]I know I'm stepping all over the place, but I have to get rid of all this bullshit first.
[105:52.21]Keep an eye out for chunks.
[105:56.42]You made those scorch marks, by the way.
[105:58.20]Yeah, I know, but I also made the chunks.
[106:00.87]I would not be able to fit this dude in here.
[106:02.29]I mean, his leg's a little unruly, but we can fix that.
[106:07.89]Yep.
[106:08.07]All right.
[106:38.77]God dammit that hurt I thought I was gonna be able to get it over there That sucked
[107:08.95]I'm gonna get the... ahhh.
[107:19.48]Okay.
[107:20.78]Alright.
[107:21.60]I fucked it up?
[107:22.04]No, I didn't.
[107:22.32]I'm fine.
[107:23.80]I'm good.
[107:28.42]This is a dirty floor.
[107:31.94]How did it get so dirty?
[107:36.30]Ah, fuck.
[107:37.15]I screwed it up.
[107:37.99]Now you can say I fucked it up, because I did.
[107:47.45]What's the purpose?
[107:48.19]Where am I?
[107:48.68]Uh... The purpose is there was an FPS video game that was played here.
[107:57.26]And you have to clean up after it, because nobody ever thinks about what happens after you leave a level.
[108:06.09]Pretty fun concept for a game.
[108:07.73]Funny.
[108:08.83]Interesting.
[108:14.27]Why am I getting minus two?
[108:16.88]I just read you the back of the box.
[108:21.96]That's like the description on the Steam page.
[108:26.92]What?
[108:34.74]Now it's gonna happen again.
[108:36.24]Put it down.
[108:37.16]It's gonna happen again.
[108:46.47]Is it really still happening?
[108:49.71]Who cares?
[108:50.25]I need like seven of these.
[109:02.70]It's the bonus room.
[109:04.90]What is that bucket giving me?
[109:07.00]I don't even care if I track.
[109:13.26]I just hit my mouth on the door.
[109:14.65]Alright.
[109:22.09]I need like seven buckets and I'll be happy.
[109:27.65]One in each corner.
[109:28.61]One right here.
[109:29.23]I'm gonna... He's tracking, he's tracking, he's tracking.
[109:31.89]I know, it's fine.
[109:34.06]I'll take care of it.
[109:42.28]I wanted to get the meat out of the way.
[109:43.80]I didn't want to pick that up.
[109:45.54]You understand.
[109:51.41]Get over here.
[109:58.56]Four buckets.
[109:59.18]One in each corner and then one in the middle.
[110:00.46]And I'll be good to go.
[110:02.48]One.
[110:03.24]Two.
[110:06.21]This is what rock bottom looks like.
[110:08.11]Shit!
[110:12.95]Shit!
[110:33.82]He's gonna hiss at us.
[110:36.18]No, that's four, we're good.
[110:47.35]Jerma is basically Adam Sandler.
[110:53.83]No, I'm not.
[110:54.27]What are you talking about?
[110:59.04]Adam Sandler, yeah.
[111:02.24]Adam Sandler.
[111:02.88]Yo, are you talking about the guy that was on Saturday Night Live?
[111:08.43]Made a bunch of funny movies back in the 90s.
[111:12.57]But just didn't know when to stop.
[111:16.25]You comparing me with a guy that's won an Emmy?
[111:19.56]Two Emmys.
[111:33.12]Alright, now we're good.
[111:35.32]Just a question of getting these tools off.
[111:40.00]Happy Gilmore was an okay movie?
[111:42.96]Yeah, it was.
[111:44.00]Yes, it was.
[111:44.56]It was fine.
[111:45.40]It was.
[111:54.21]What was wrong with Happy Gilmore?
[111:55.45]It was fun.
[111:56.09]It was funny.
[111:57.15]I mean, maybe it was, like, a little shitty, but...
[112:11.59]A little.
[112:17.84]Don't drop it.
[112:18.82]Pick it up.
[112:19.34]Pick up!
[112:21.14]Why are you so large?
[112:22.40]Get in there.
[112:24.30]See?
[112:24.78]We're almost done with this room.
[112:29.28]Won't be long.
[112:29.80]It'll be like another two hours tops.
[112:33.69]This is getting full.
[112:34.83]Give it a jiggle.
[112:39.75]It's alright, I'll just, I'm gonna take this, take it out now.
[112:50.02]I know I'm tracking, I know, I know, I know, I just saw it in the chat.
[112:53.32]I get it.
[112:53.72]I get it.
[112:59.98]Wash the entry.
[113:00.92]No.
[113:02.60]Wash the entry.
[113:03.70]I'm not going to.
[113:11.10]All that down there.
[113:12.10]Oh, there's so much.
[113:16.06]There's so much left.
[113:17.50]Alright, just stick with the plan.
[113:21.99]Wrong room.
[113:26.69]Fucking piece of shit streamer!
[113:30.13]Hey, relax, man!
[113:35.11]Whoa!
[113:38.03]Oh my god!
[113:52.26]I just need to get it out of the way.
[113:53.14]Where's my incinerator?
[114:03.01]What is this?
[114:06.53]It's fucking gold!
[114:10.38]Can I sell this?
[114:35.22]I don't know what it is about these streams in particular, but I just love... I don't know why I'm having so much fun doing stupid shit that everybody hates.
[114:43.01]It's like a weird thing with these streams.
[114:46.31]I don't know why I do it when I play this game.
[114:52.52]When am I getting BTTV?
[114:53.82]Never.
[114:54.04]I'm making a volcano.
[115:02.90]Uh, yeah, I just did that.
[115:05.08]I'll take the credit for it.
[115:10.31]Alright, looking good, looking good.
[115:17.29]Watch out for the super volcano.
[115:19.89]There's no super volcano.
[115:36.54]Now, okay, there is this, okay, there's a little baby volcano that sits underneath.
[115:43.88]Scientists are predicting that it could blow any minute, but they're talking about the scale of the universe.
[115:49.16]So any minute for the scale of the universe, you know, we've only been here, humans have only been around for like 600 years, right?
[115:57.67]So, I mean, you're talking about like potentially a million years before that blows.
[116:25.50]I need a bucket.
[116:36.68]I gotta get rid of this thing.
[116:39.50]I know I fucked up the volcano, but I need the box.
[116:51.18]I hope new viewers are coming in and hearing this.
[116:53.27]I know, I don't know what I'm doing.
[116:57.41]If that's the first thing you hear, you're probably just like, whoa.
[117:01.87]Alright, see ya.
[117:09.73]I need... Getting there, getting there, getting there.
[117:23.72]Almost done.
[117:31.72]But, alright, I'm gonna be completely real, no joking around.
[117:35.11]If there is a giant super-volcano under the earth... Whatever!
[117:39.51]You know?
[117:41.67]What are we gonna do about it?
[117:45.43]What are we gonna do?
[117:50.59]Live your life.
[117:55.59]Try your best.
[118:03.76]Look, here's the problem, right?
[118:05.44]You never want it to be a situation where it's like, well, that thing could explode.
[118:08.92]So let's go down and send a nuclear bomb into it.
[118:12.53]No, no, no, no, no.
[118:13.17]Don't do that.
[118:14.47]Maybe if we dig down and put a giant drill and let out the air pressure.
[118:18.01]No, don't do that either.
[118:22.34]Be careful.
[118:33.20]What is this?
[118:38.69]Because nobody knows what it actually is.
[118:40.87]What if they go down there and it's a giant monster?
[118:43.67]And the monster finally just is like, all right, well now you woke me up.
[118:49.17]You know that movie Godzilla?
[118:50.81]You ain't seen nothing.
[119:05.61]Don't knock it over.
[119:06.31]Okay.
[119:06.75]Just trash.
[119:11.05]Why is the monster up to date with pop culture?
[119:14.27]What the hell else are you gonna do down there?
[119:27.68]Not much you can do when you're surrounded by fire.
[119:32.46]And you're locked in the center of the earth.
[119:36.18]You're probably going to watch Friends every season ten times.
[119:40.98]You've had thousands of years to do it.
[119:54.89]I did that.
[119:55.73]Yeah, and look, you're talking about, oh, like, what would he be doing down there?
[120:00.19]Are you serious?
[120:00.91]You're not even a monster and you did that.
[120:04.84]How many times have you loaded the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood Season 2 intro?
[120:09.86]And listened to it?
[120:10.62]You know how many times he's fucking done that?
[120:13.16]Okay, let's get the rest of this shit.
[120:27.79]I gotta bring another box down here.
[120:29.37]This is a big box level, I would say.
[120:34.03]I need, like, four of these down here.
[120:35.47]I don't know how I got to this germa stream, but I guess I'm gonna stay on this germa stream.
[120:44.34]Well, hey, welcome.
[120:46.26]Thanks for sticking around.
[120:46.96]Yeah, we do this thing here where we talk about, like, topics.
[120:54.57]Like, what if, kind of, what if scenarios.
[120:57.83]Like, what if Godzilla was real?
[120:58.85]You know what I mean?
[120:59.27]That's what this thing...
[121:17.55]Cheater.
[121:18.25]Console.
[121:18.83]I accidentally hit the tilde.
[121:20.13]What do you want from me?
[121:25.65]I'm gonna report this stream for trolling if you don't make a good joke soon.
[121:28.59]What do you mean report me for trolling?
[121:39.50]Who am I trolling?
[121:40.74]You?
[121:41.46]Me?
[121:42.42]Am I trolling myself?
[121:43.44]I don't understand.
[121:51.35]When have I ever said that there's gonna be a good joke incoming?
[121:57.01]I've never done that.
[121:59.35]There are no expectations here.
[122:01.85]Leave him at the door!
[122:12.14]Do the siren joke again.
[122:15.60]I probably will, like, three more times.
[122:17.18]Don't worry.
[122:17.56]If you hang out here long enough, you'll see that, like, probably five more times.
[122:28.73]Okay.
[122:29.65]I need two buckets.
[122:36.35]Ooh!
[122:37.31]I just Tony Hawk'd it!
[122:45.26]I've given myself landmines in every corner.
[122:47.57]That's not a good idea.
[122:48.47]Ah, do I need this thing?
[122:56.92]No, probably not.
[123:08.57]Knife.
[123:08.83]Get it in there.
[123:11.46]Blood on the ceiling?
[123:12.14]I'll get it.
[123:12.46]Don't worry.
[123:13.64]I'll take care of it.
[123:22.95]I'm just realizing something.
[123:23.85]This is a huge soundtrack.
[123:27.51]How long is this soundtrack?
[123:33.36]Seems pretty long.
[123:35.12]Wait.
[123:35.34]This thing has wheels.
[123:37.46]Can I...
[123:41.33]Caught it.
[123:42.15]Yep.
[123:42.59]Reflexes like a goddamn... Cat.
[124:10.03]Bill joke.
[124:15.23]When did this soundtrack come out?
[124:19.43]Is this 94?
[124:20.21]93?
[124:21.33]94, right?
[124:30.31]That's pretty damn good.
[124:33.55]They should do another one.
[124:38.90]No, and I'm not talking about Donkey Kong Country 7-Eleven fucking icy freeze.
[124:44.28]I'm talking about a Donkey Kong Country game.
[124:46.62]Shit, there's so much over here.
[124:55.91]Did they do one for the Switch?
[125:10.83]Tropical Freeze was composed by the same guy.
[125:13.50]Oh.
[125:16.66]Whoops.
[125:18.32]Sorry about that.
[125:18.98]This hurts my eyes.
[125:26.11]Can this show?
[125:32.11]Maybe that's a good thing to have.
[125:38.75]Was Tropical Freeze a good game?
[125:42.78]I think I actually bought that a long time ago.
[125:48.48]It's great.
[125:52.96]It's very hard, but yes.
[125:54.26]Alright.
[125:59.21]If Nintendo is smart, don't you think?
[126:03.99]Because let's face it.
[126:06.27]Like, 42 people bought the Wii U. Don't you think they should just bring some of those games over?
[126:13.70]What's this thing?
[126:19.34]I'm just checking to see if it was worth keeping.
[126:23.43]They have been.
[126:23.95]That was a perfect throw.
[126:28.07]I couldn't have tried to do that.
[126:29.37]I hope you understand.
[126:37.91]Tropical Freeze is on the switch.
[126:40.89]Oh.
[126:44.52]That's kind of cool.
[126:50.47]If Nintendo was smart, then Star Fox would... Yeah.
[126:56.89]They probably tried to make a couple of... Didn't they try to make one a few years ago?
[127:01.28]And the Wii U was really hitting the bottom of its life cycle.
[127:05.02]And they maybe just were like, nah, probably not worth it.
[127:20.25]Why did the Wii U fail?
[127:21.35]Uh, because they named it the same thing as the other console, with a U in front of it.
[127:30.68]And they had a giant Game Gear for a controller.
[127:47.07]It was a clunky mess.
[127:49.42]Maybe with some decent titles on it.
[127:54.34]But the Switch has the Joy-Cons, and then, oh, get the Pro Controller.
[127:57.48]You would have a box of controller peripherals for that system.
[128:02.88]Because holding on to that giant brick iPad Game Gear thing was... No way could you do that for more than, like, an hour or two.
[128:09.60]It'd hurt.
[128:18.73]The Switch is the Wii U with detachable confr- yeah, but it's also more comfortable.
[128:24.19]The Wii U pad was thick.
[128:27.13]It was thick.
[128:29.43]And chunky.
[128:43.68]Like, the Wii U was pretty damn chunky.
[128:45.74]I wouldn't be surprised if it was a murder weapon at some point.
[128:49.45]That thing weighed, like, four pounds.
[128:58.31]Get rid of this.
[128:58.76]Alright, this room's pretty much done.
[129:10.16]And the news outlets would have got it all wrong.
[129:12.58]It would have been like... Local man smashes a brick into a friend's face...
[129:19.47]They don't have to fax, you know?
[129:20.61]That was a Wii U. This one's done.
[129:31.84]I just got a couple more little pieces to figure out.
[129:41.93]Why do you know so much about this?
[129:44.19]Covering my own crimes.
[129:47.03]No, sorry guys, I didn't like... I didn't like Wii U brick pad somebody in the face.
[129:53.65]Good thing that wasn't a bucket, it can't be spilled!
[130:03.21]There's someone behind you.
[130:06.91]What the heck?
[130:13.91]Okay... Oh, that can stay.
[130:18.75]Any more pieces I need to pick up besides this?
[130:21.81]I'm just gonna... Let's try to spin it out of here.
[130:24.47]Ready?
[130:25.89]Ready for a ball camp?
[130:32.87]Oh, imagine if it had bounced up there, bounced into the incinerator.
[130:35.92]That would have been a clip of the week!
[130:39.96]Ceiling.
[130:40.48]What's wrong with the ceiling?
[130:54.81]Looks pretty sleek.
[130:55.97]Just gotta move some stuff around.
[130:59.17]Some over here.
[131:04.65]It's still red.
[131:07.39]Ooh, that was close.
[131:08.32]Get over here.
[131:28.48]Don't forget about the bullet holes.
[131:31.20]I will.
[131:31.46]I'm just going to be frank with you.
[131:34.18]I absolutely will forget about that until the very end of this level.
[131:40.57]And the chat is just going to be spamming with LUL.
[131:45.11]Idiot.
[131:45.47]You're going to see it.
[131:55.24]Balefishes.
[131:55.92]Yeah, that'll happen too.
[131:58.69]Alright, what do we got?
[132:02.75]Corner here.
[132:04.39]Close this up.
[132:12.92]Mm-hmm.
[132:15.00]This room looks pretty done.
[132:21.26]All around the alien containers looks good.
[132:24.06]I think we're good.
[132:29.84]Looks good!
[132:40.73]Ceiling?
[132:41.13]Eh, that was a little bit on there, wasn't it?
[132:42.29]A little bit.
[132:48.90]Pick this up, just to have it.
[132:50.68]Dust.
[132:54.06]Okay.
[132:54.70]Let's move on.
[132:56.42]Med- I need a med kit.
[133:00.87]Is that what this shit is for?
[133:04.10]First aid supplies.
[133:05.24]Let me see it.
[133:20.29]Do I have to actually put this fucking thing in?
[133:22.07]Oh, damn.
[133:28.89]Okay.
[133:33.84]Just put it out.
[133:34.36]I did it.
[133:34.72]I got it.
[133:35.00]I got it.
[133:35.26]I got it.
[133:35.50]I got it.
[133:37.08]So what is this stuff for?
[133:39.92]Solar flare, wet floor sign, pizza slicer, toilet seat, lantern.
[133:43.66]What are these for?
[133:44.88]Is this gonna be bright?
[133:48.06]How bright is this?
[133:50.86]How do I turn it on?
[134:05.25]Put it in the fire.
[134:05.95]Okay.
[134:10.80]Oh, cool, okay.
[134:11.98]Well, I need it back.
[134:16.65]Well, at least I know what it does.
[134:18.59]Who cares?
[134:19.31]What's the point of that?
[134:42.54]I mean, that's cool, I guess.
[134:46.53]Make 20 of them.
[134:47.65]No, I don't want to melt everybody's eyes.
[134:49.45]I just want to see what it looked like.
[134:50.95]Alright.
[134:52.65]Let's go.
[134:54.11]This room's done.
[134:55.55]Close it up.
[134:56.57]I gotta close the rooms that are done.
[135:00.39]Because I will forget and I'll walk around in circles.
[135:02.62]I'll come back in and I'll double check it.
[135:06.38]For now, we're gonna seal it up.
[135:11.83]Handprint.
[135:16.22]How did you even see that?
[135:20.10]I don't know how you even saw that shit.
[135:33.27]We got 2 hours and 15 minutes.
[135:36.85]Maybe another 10 minutes.
[135:43.91]I got so many buckets.
[135:44.89]So, we go... That's the way up.
[135:47.71]I'm almost done.
[135:50.19]I'll get a rhythm.
[135:51.33]Watch the rhythm.
[136:02.24]I'm gonna make a Hansel and Gretel trail.
[136:05.26]Of buckets.
[136:08.52]Oh yeah, wait, I forgot about this room.
[136:10.22]I was supposed to do this one first.
[136:28.69]Fuck, whatever.
[136:32.15]Haven't even been to the basement or the second floor yet.
[136:36.49]I'll be alright.
[136:43.32]Wait, there's a basement?
[136:53.02]That's fine, I'll be the first person ever on stream to beat this level.
[136:57.78]I'm okay having that.
[137:04.84]Look at how many buckets I got, it's gonna take no time at all once we set it all up.
[137:12.11]Fix the bullet holes?
[137:13.53]Don't worry, I'll get it all.
[137:17.47]I will get it all.
[137:18.73]This is off, right?
[137:20.11]Yeah.
[137:21.98]Just need a couple more incinerators.
[137:23.36]Alright, I'm not tracking.
[137:34.39]I'm gonna stack them.
[137:36.99]Four should be enough.
[137:41.78]Can I do this?
[138:05.17]I could probably do more.
[138:06.29]No, I got it.
[138:06.79]Everything's fine.
[138:16.14]Put these around the room.
[138:16.88]Don't fucking... Watch the bus.
[138:18.30]There's so many landmines around me.
[138:21.27]Alright, move this down here.
[138:24.91]Don't step on a landmine.
[138:27.65]You.
[138:28.25]Come this way.
[138:29.57]Down here.
[138:31.29]Right in the middle.
[138:33.82]Look at all this junk.
[138:42.34]I think we're in a decent spot to start picking up the chunks.
[138:46.41]This can probably go over here.
[138:48.19]Yeah.
[138:52.05]Okay.
[138:53.21]Corner to corner.
[138:57.81]Uh, we got a whip cream canister.
[139:00.81]CO2.
[139:03.23]That's another, another $50 just coming.
[139:10.29]Yeah, Comfort Eagle just gave $50.
[139:15.62]Oh my god, damn it!
[139:16.98]Okay, I stepped on one landmine.
[139:18.64]I didn't, he did.
[139:19.74]He stepped on a landmine, I didn't touch it.
[139:25.47]But thank you so much, Comfort Eagle.
[139:27.23]If you stack the buckets inside each other, you can carry more than one to and from your work area.
[139:34.60]Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to handle that.
[139:41.56]Let's just make a pile.
[139:43.68]Thank you, Comfort Eagle.
[139:45.46]I could try.
[139:47.48]Cut up the bodies with the pizza slicer.
[139:57.29]The pizza slides are- No, I need the laser gun!
[140:05.77]Great Canadian!
[140:07.31]There was nothing in- It didn't even spill.
[140:09.79]I'm good.
[140:11.43]Great Canadian Fuck Club just gave out five community subs.
[140:17.48]Thank you.
[140:19.44]Thank you so much.
[140:26.98]Alright, I gotta cut his... Can I do it in the bucket?
[140:37.20]Alright, I got it.
[140:40.93]I turned him into a Bloodborne enemy.
[140:44.17]Alright, those can fit.
[141:00.02]No, no, no, no.
[141:00.84]Alright.
[141:20.55]Now let's chunk it up.
[141:35.48]Somebody said you have at least three more hours here.
[141:40.30]This is Dr. Phil.
[141:42.73]And you are having a problem, it seems.
[141:46.57]I'll take fucking plus five for that one.
[142:06.52]It's 500.
[142:17.12]Shit, I'm usually gonna time in that.
[142:18.42]If it doesn't fix the bullet holes, I'm gonna do that at the very end.
[142:24.19]Because then I can just go look at them all and want to track dirt everywhere and all that shit.
[142:29.41]I'll get them.
[142:31.45]Because I need to use the gun for that.
[142:36.77]Put on a Dr. Phil OST.
[142:38.47]Put on a Dr. Phil episode.
[142:44.10]No.
[142:45.14]I'm not gonna put on Dr. Phil.
[142:52.11]Dr. Phil doesn't have an OST.
[143:07.35]He does.
[143:17.83]This is his theme song?
[143:34.12]It's when, yeah, no, this is when he comes out.
[143:35.88]Yeah, okay.
[143:37.58]The audience is clapping.
[143:39.54]He walks out, sits down in his big chair.
[143:41.32]Okay.
[143:51.95]So, uh, what's next on the autoplay?
[143:53.99]I don't know.
[143:54.63]Looks like Dr. Phil theme music HD.
[144:07.92]What's the difference?
[144:08.64]How is this one high quality?
[144:11.52]It's the same song.
[144:20.18]Does he have an outro?
[144:21.22]Or is the intro the outro?
[144:26.57]It's probably one of those scenarios.
[144:35.11]Are you certain...
[144:37.39]Are we sure this is not like Sonic Tennis?
[144:41.45]Choose your character screen.
[144:52.49]That's what it sounds like.
[145:01.49]Oh my god.
[145:05.70]I gotta move this shit out of the way.
[145:06.86]There's dirt, bile, and puke all over the walls.
[145:19.05]Dr. Phil in the chat.
[145:20.36]Are you serious?
[145:25.00]What's up, man?
[145:27.74]Oh, Dr. Phil raid!
[145:29.84]Here comes a Dr. Phil raid!
[145:32.51]Six and a half million people just showed up.
[145:34.83]Oh, hey, whoa!
[145:44.02]Hey, thanks for the raid, man.
[145:45.06]See you at TwitchCon.
[145:50.22]This is not like a 10-hour version of the song, is it?
[145:52.98]This song is gonna make me lose my fucking mind.
[146:03.61]I don't check?!
[146:06.01]I have to check!
[146:07.29]I think that's it.
[146:10.18]Yeah, that's it.
[146:11.38]Here comes another one.
[146:12.56]This is a different theme song though, somehow.
[146:14.24]This is... I don't know, this has a theme song?
[146:20.97]This is the Wheel of Fortune OST.
[146:32.42]I like this one.
[146:34.84]Yeah, I do.
[146:35.38]This is good.
[146:35.84]I have some dirty buckets.
[146:47.84]This fits, too.
[146:49.06]This is a pretty good selection.
[146:49.98]Who picked this?
[146:52.26]Oh, YouTube's auto algorithm bot?
[147:02.35]Hey, I'll see you at TwitchCon.
[147:06.79]TwitchCon.
[147:07.65]I didn't go to TwitchCon.
[147:15.43]Save.
[147:16.33]Ooh, good idea.
[147:17.45]Am I already... 1.20, 2.14.
[147:26.02]Did I only save one time in the middle of Santa's Workshop?
[147:33.23]I would go to TwitchCon if Vanna White and, yeah, if the cast of, and the crew of Wheel of Fortune went to TwitchCon and they had like a panel, I would go.
[147:47.68]And let me try the stacking thing that that person was talking about.
[147:49.88]He's either dirty, he's gotta go.
[148:07.19]A Wheel of Fortune raid incoming.
[148:10.00]God, I would love to go on one of those shows.
[148:12.48]And just botch the absolute hell out of everything.
[148:16.02]Spin the wheel the wrong way every time.
[148:18.92]No, no, no, Jeremy, stop doing that.
[148:20.76]You're spinning the wheel the wrong way.
[148:23.09]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[148:23.79]Uh, any vowels?
[148:34.27]Uh, you have to ask me for a letter.
[148:37.80]Oh, uh, D. D is not a vowel, god damn it!
[148:42.68]Now I'm gonna get him to scream like a swear on the air.
[148:44.60]And like end his career.
[149:04.67]Why would this come up next?
[149:06.19]I don't know why this would come up next.
[149:08.67]But apparently we're going to see this.
[149:10.83]This is not connected to... There's no reason for this.
[149:22.82]Is this going to be TV?
[149:23.72]We're going to go from here.
[149:25.26]I bet you Grey's Anatomy is next.
[149:30.37]On the autoplay.
[149:33.71]I wonder.
[149:49.95]Alright.
[149:57.63]Holy shit, it works.
[150:16.33]No, this one's fine.
[150:18.55]Alright, is it Grey's Anatomy?
[150:22.31]Well, I think this is extended.
[150:31.97]No.
[150:32.95]It's not Grey's Anatomy.
[150:35.09]It's something else.
[150:49.92]This is a different version.
[150:56.82]I think this one might be HD, yeah.
[151:00.08]Sounds like an HD version.
[151:13.63]This bot is going to get nuked.
[151:18.19]Yeah, oh god, the screams, the sound of saws and machinery, the roaring and restless groans from the cells, it's too much, all so wrong.
[151:37.78]This is so dirty back here.
[151:46.52]I gotta get rid of all of them.
[151:51.91]Can we get something else besides the Breaking Bad theme?
[151:54.27]And then after, whatever the next one is, I gotta turn it off before I get, like, before I get deleted.
[152:00.05]I'm gonna get deleted on the air.
[152:16.19]This is going to be stream offline in about 35 seconds.
[152:23.09]Alright, new buckets.
[152:25.81]Let's go.
[152:26.19]New buckets.
[152:26.84]New.
[152:27.22]New.
[152:28.32]Don't spill it.
[152:37.02]Don't be a coward.
[152:40.26]I want people to be able to watch the VODs.
[152:46.93]okay we'll get one more holy shit I've never even seen this show I'll clean this up later I've never seen this show is this a good show
[153:22.81]This one's very low.
[153:24.53]It's not that audible.
[153:26.31]It's Modern Family.
[153:29.93]Thankfully it's only 30 seconds long.
[153:44.56]Um... What are these shows that I've never heard of?
[153:47.97]Mom?
[153:48.79]CBS TV series.
[153:52.83]This is a six minute video.
[153:59.01]How could you have an intro for your show that's six fucking minutes long?
[154:09.02]What have I done over here?
[154:10.04]Ah!
[154:17.92]Yeah, I have to next this.
[154:19.00]No, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this.
[154:23.84]I'm next-ing it.
[154:25.72]By the way, this is- I believe this is the song- This is an orchestra version of the song that we were just hearing!
[154:37.05]This is the mom song, but it's an orchestra doing the actual song.
[154:45.13]Alright.
[154:45.85]Next, again.
[154:49.14]Okay, this is... This is the same... This is the same song, I think.
[155:04.53]No, let's do it again.
[155:05.65]What is this?
[155:19.17]What is it?
[155:20.35]Is this?
[155:20.69]Oh, wait a minute.
[155:21.37]Oh, this is Star Wars!
[155:25.60]I gotta get out of there!
[155:27.64]Wait here!
[155:30.78]No!
[155:31.74]Don't wake up!
[155:36.73]Get off!
[155:52.44]I almost just turned off the stream for the joke.
[155:54.20]I almost just turned my fucking stream off.
[156:00.33]But I don't want to do that.
[156:01.53]It's been like two and a half hours.
[156:02.57]I want to keep playing.
[156:05.77]I can't just like delete the stream.
[156:12.39]That would have been worth it.
[156:14.13]Maybe.
[156:14.51]Not after two and a half hours.
[156:16.73]Okay, if it had been like seven hours, I may have done it.
[156:21.37]Still early.
[156:21.87]Come on.
[156:26.31]Alright, let's clean this up.
[156:36.51]No, no more OSTs.
[156:37.49]I want to be able to have a non-muted VOD for five minutes.
[156:53.14]Parks and Rec?
[156:57.12]Nah.
[157:01.82]My VODs never get muted?
[157:02.92]Well, I don't really play music.
[157:07.35]I very rarely play music.
[157:08.71]Usually when we're just hanging out.
[157:11.35]Just being dickheads in a game like this is when I play music on the stream.
[157:21.24]Put on binaural beats.
[157:25.19]No, I'm not gonna like mind control everybody in here.
[157:27.53]Alright, here we go.
[157:43.53]Binaural feats.
[157:45.43]Isn't that the shit that just goes like...
[158:01.57]No, no, we gotta play the low one too.
[158:03.31]Yeah, it goes like... Get off.
[158:17.36]You know what binaural beats sounds like?
[158:18.82]You know when you have your cell phone sitting near a computer and your phone is about to ring and you get that
[158:30.65]Oh, my phone's gonna ring.
[158:39.94]That can't be healthy, right?
[158:43.54]The fact that we can hear that when your phone is near a speaker or a computer or something, that can't be good.
[159:04.46]El Fatso crisps.
[159:07.33]It's interference.
[159:08.07]I mean, it is.
[159:17.37]I'm most certainly pleased with the progress we've made in recent months.
[159:19.85]The DNA harvested from the captured alien creatures has allowed our creation to truly blossom into a vessel of unprecedented strength and malice.
[159:27.54]With further treatments, I'm certain we can realign the creature's mental capacity as we need.
[159:32.42]And on a final note, who is responsible for the continued theft of my Gloomberry Donuts?
[159:38.31]How do you fast forward a stream?
[159:41.11]There's a button down there.
[159:42.59]It's play, fast forward, and then next.
[159:47.81]And if you press the fast forward button, you can get it to work.
[159:54.76]But everybody has to collectively press it at the same time.
[159:58.56]And if you don't, then it's not going to work.
[160:03.78]So, I mean, it needs to be at least five to...
[160:08.45]Like 500 to 2,000 people have to all do it at the same time.
[160:10.93]You like it?
[160:42.82]So if you are
[161:14.50]Yeah, I mean, I've never been, that's the first time I was ever naked, so.
[161:20.05]It's hard to be naked.
[161:22.59]When you're naked, you know, people can just see you.
[161:25.09]They can see who you fucking really are.
[161:27.17]So that's why I don't do it anymore, but.
[161:29.51]Thanks for the $4,000.
[161:30.29]Appreciate it.
[161:34.25]Somebody, you know, over the course of the last four hours or so, thank you.
[161:51.43]And I fucked it all up again, didn't I?
[162:11.89]You guys seriously have
[162:19.35]No, Inaka, don't rewind me.
[162:20.53]Don't do it!
[162:21.73]I've been sitting here for so long.
[162:23.23]It's been four hours.
[162:24.52]No, you're gonna delete the $4,000 that the guy just gave me.
[162:27.24]Don't do it.
[162:28.78]No, I want that four grand.
[162:30.84]Don't bring me back.
[162:32.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[162:33.64]Don't do it, don't do it.
[162:36.40]Stop.
[162:36.68]Get your finger off that button.
[162:39.30]No!
[162:41.78]Oh!
[162:43.15]It's pulling me in three different directions.
[162:44.85]I'm going across dimensions.
[162:48.10]Fucking binaural beats!
[162:52.41]Don't do it!
[162:55.99]No!
[163:01.89]No!
[163:08.50]No, don't!
[163:09.02]I mean, you're killing me!
[163:11.16]You're killing me!
[163:15.01]Oh!
[163:37.73]Don't do it!
[163:44.27]Get... There's blood coming out of my eyes!
[164:02.92]I can fight it!
[164:05.26]For another minute or two, I can fight the whole thing!
[164:11.07]There's blood coming out of my mouth!
[164:13.81]There's blood coming out of my mouth!
[164:27.14]Oh yeah Jimmy!
[164:28.82]Wait!
[164:58.04]So I think with this box here I can, um... I can use this, right?
[165:09.53]Fill up the pieces and bring it down?
[165:10.73]How long do you think it's gonna take me to do this?
[165:15.19]I would say probably... What is it?
[165:17.39]Two and a half hours?
[165:19.63]Well... No, okay, nothing in there.
[165:22.94]Fuck!
[165:23.46]This is gonna take so long!
[165:30.52]Is there an upstairs?
[165:31.78]There's not an upstairs.
[165:36.79]No fucking way.
[165:38.71]Well, whatever.
[165:41.35]Uh, can I open the doors?
[165:48.66]I don't think I can.
[165:54.02]This one... This one looks already clean.
[166:00.05]I don't get it.
[166:02.39]Where do the buckets come from?
[166:10.92]This feels kind of weird.
[166:11.92]Alright, music!
[166:19.38]The volume's all the way down from the last stream.
[166:22.39]Right?
[166:23.07]That's not, okay.
[166:24.05]Well, what we got?
[166:33.98]I don't like that one.
[166:38.48]That's the same one.
[166:40.88]I don't like either one of these.
[166:44.61]No.
[166:44.81]I don't think so.
[166:45.37]Doom OST, I'm not gonna play Doom OST.
[167:00.90]I'm not doing the OST thing.
[167:01.90]I want to hit the actual in-game music.
[167:05.22]No, no, no, no, no!
[167:09.87]No, no, no, no, no!
[167:12.53]There we go.
[167:20.33]So where should I start?
[167:24.41]So what's like the dynamite thing here?
[167:28.12]Is a diamond going to come out of there?
[167:30.20]What's like the funny thing for this one?
[167:33.47]This room is clean.
[167:38.37]My fucking game is bugged, I think somehow.
[167:40.25]Isn't this supposed to be dirt in here?
[167:56.52]And, uh, other strange thing that I'm kind of noticing at the moment.
[168:00.78]Why am I covered in blood?
[168:02.24]Me, in real life.
[168:06.63]I blinked a couple times and I just, I'm seeing red.
[168:11.43]This is, uh, maybe I was doing like a funny, hey look, I'm in the game joke.
[168:16.81]Did I turn the webcam on?
[168:18.51]Did I?
[168:21.64]What fucking time is it?
[168:26.34]Did you see a doctor about that?
[168:27.64]Did you see a doctor about it?
[168:34.06]Should I?
[168:39.21]What doctor are you referring to?
[168:40.89]Talking about the good Dr. Phil?
[168:48.21]What even is this?
[168:48.97]What is this sound?
[168:50.11]What is this fucking song?
[168:54.22]What an awful fucking song.
[168:55.70]What is this, like fucking Sonic Tennis?
[169:15.70]Dr. Phil's raiding!
[169:18.42]Oh, hey, Dr. Phil, see you at TwitchCon, man.
[169:20.94]I'll high-five you.
[169:27.39]That's so funny.
[169:28.43]What's next on the auto-play?
[169:29.71]What the fuck is this?
[169:31.79]Are you shitting me?
[169:34.11]This- The A-steam?
[169:44.25]That one is even louder, somehow.
[169:46.13]Alright, let's continue cleaning.
[169:55.96]This is a fun game.
[170:02.98]What was the DNA?
[170:03.77]Oops!
[170:06.63]This room is almost done.
[170:07.63]Can I pick this up?
[170:11.78]Move this over here.
[170:15.50]Ha!
[170:19.30]Fill it up.
[170:20.55]Hey!
[170:21.71]Doctor, fill it up!
[170:31.70]I want to get rid of this.
[170:32.65]I never... What's the point of this?
[170:38.23]Bring him further back.
[170:39.35]I don't know what you mean by that.
[170:40.41]All I can taste is blood.
[171:01.74]Alright, speaking of blood, I gotta go pee.
[171:03.58]No, that's not... Fuck.
[171:09.93]Alright, I'll be back.
[171:11.83]I'm gonna grab another drink, get some water, and take a piss.
[171:13.98]I'll be right back.
[174:56.24]This is going to be a changing day in your life.
[175:04.79]Hey, he's back.
[175:10.91]That's enough of that.
[175:16.39]Thought I just turned on the camera, that would have been bad.
[175:23.31]Is this the joke of the month?
[175:27.59]Well, it is, it is, it's barely January, so... That hadn't even been one full week.
[175:42.04]Let me open this back up, and let's keep going.
[175:44.57]Let me, uh... Let me fix all the shit that I just ruined in the game.
[175:49.45]What's going on?
[175:51.09]Oh, right.
[175:53.15]Okay.
[175:55.82]I kind of ruined everything so just added like a 45 minute plus timer to the Get him to the 23rd quick get him to the 23rd You know part of that is really really really morbid of some of you guys Skip to the 23rd Why?
[176:25.23]Because that's when you're supposed to die.
[176:27.61]Okay.
[176:29.75]Oh my goodness.
[176:43.34]That's going to be the worst stream of the year.
[176:44.75]I hope you guys understand that.
[176:46.35]There's no... Oh, I wonder what he's going to do.
[176:50.97]I told you what I'm going to do.
[176:53.09]That's the stream.
[176:56.23]I'm sitting in the room in a fucking goalie outfit.
[176:58.35]And I'm just... I'm just gonna survive.
[177:01.29]That's it.
[177:15.29]What room was I in?
[177:18.85]What am I talking about?
[177:20.77]Like almost a year ago, I played a game.
[177:22.93]It was a game about like having illnesses and you could play as yourself.
[177:29.15]And I named the character me and the game told me that I was gonna die on January 23rd, 2019.
[177:34.78]So... That's coming up.
[177:45.84]So, I'm gonna Final Destination my room.
[177:52.08]I'm gonna be drinking out of sippy cups.
[177:54.64]I'm gonna be covered in pads.
[178:06.65]Am I gonna go back to Kenshi?
[178:09.88]Oh, probably.
[178:11.78]Probably this weekend.
[178:13.80]Because the plan was, we're going to do this tonight.
[178:17.02]Because I love this game.
[178:19.42]And then after tonight, tomorrow either get back to Kenshi.
[178:23.54]Or Simpsons hit and run.
[178:26.14]That's the plan.
[178:27.78]Either one of them will work, because whatever one doesn't happen, the other one will happen the next day.
[178:33.27]So it depends.
[178:39.09]The reason why the Simpsons hit and run was not tonight...
[178:43.03]is very, very specifically because I have it for PlayStation 2.
[178:51.07]Can I, like, say a word with an F?
[178:55.16]I have it for PS2.
[178:59.16]And I was told that it actually exists for PC.
[179:04.06]And there are mods.
[179:06.08]And the game is way better on PC.
[179:08.04]So I don't know how the hell I'm going to work that out.
[179:14.20]But that's why I didn't do it tonight, because I was gonna play it on PS2.
[179:17.66]And it turns out, I probably shouldn't do that.
[179:21.16]If for some reason I can't get the PC version with the mods to work, then I'm just gonna do the PlayStation 2 version.
[179:28.76]So.
[179:32.09]That's the plan.
[179:34.07]I need another- I need to get with the program here.
[179:36.97]Give me some buckets.
[179:39.53]And then 700,000 games part 2, yes.
[179:43.83]Probably in that order.
[179:44.73]I'll probably wait for next week to do 700,000 games, too.
[179:50.19]Give me a break.
[179:56.70]Fucking RNG.
[179:58.06]Fucking RNG.
[179:58.70]Okay, just make... Alright, that was pretty cool.
[180:10.53]Yeah, there is a 700,000 Games Part 2.
[180:13.49]The company made another one.
[180:16.22]And we need to see what it is.
[180:18.38]So, that's gonna be a whole stream.
[180:21.94]I just kick-flipped.
[180:24.08]Yes, I did.
[180:25.62]Do these fit in here?
[180:29.29]No, I'm gonna have to stack these and walk them.
[180:31.29]Just stack them up and walk them.
[180:37.85]What's the best way to stack these?
[180:42.49]Like this?
[180:44.75]Like this.
[180:46.23]Like this.
[180:51.10]What the fuck?
[180:52.28]Actually, that's a better way to do it, I think.
[181:15.77]Look, I could play this game and be in a meeting.
[181:20.41]I wonder how many lawyers own this game.
[181:23.45]And they're on the phone with a client.
[181:27.49]Just doing this.
[181:36.50]I'm doing these all upside down, huh?
[181:37.80]Fucking idiot.
[181:41.58]Fucking idiot.
[181:42.36]Idiot!
[181:51.50]See if I can even do this.
[182:03.08]Somehow magically they haven't fallen.
[182:11.15]Whoa!
[182:38.33]Yeah, hold all my calls.
[182:41.43]I got a meeting.
[182:42.73]I got something else important going on.
[182:44.79]Can this even fit in here?
[182:49.19]I can barely fit the fucking printer in here.
[182:51.49]Okay?
[182:53.02]Close it up.
[183:02.66]Well, I'm gonna have to put these in.
[183:04.28]Oh my, I didn't even spill it.
[183:05.84]I picked it up.
[183:08.09]I picked it up.
[183:09.19]It didn't spill.
[183:09.97]I picked it up.
[183:23.03]It's a lot of work.
[183:24.01]I got a lot of meetings to miss, okay?
[183:38.88]Alright, we're good.
[183:39.86]Hold on to the box.
[183:53.35]Fuck it.
[183:53.97]Just... Don't let me forget about these.
[184:10.68]Alright!
[184:11.98]Okay!
[184:13.36]Fun!
[184:16.60]Persona 5 OST?
[184:21.43]No, I'm not gonna- no.
[184:23.33]No Persona 5.
[184:26.43]I'm gonna play that game, if anything.
[184:28.77]Alright, I got a full bucket here.
[184:29.97]No, I'm not gonna play it on stream.
[184:46.89]Minesweeper OST.
[184:47.83]Alright, I'm not going to say the word OST.
[184:54.38]For another year.
[184:56.56]Okay?
[185:08.02]We're going to hold you to that.
[185:09.23]Do it!
[185:18.34]There's so many more rooms.
[185:22.28]Uh, 24 hour stream apparently confirmed, because this is not- how the fuck am I gonna do this?
[185:30.87]Do it.
[185:38.03]24- alright.
[185:40.11]So those of you that are internet connoisseurs, there are 4,300 people watching this stream right now.
[185:49.09]I'm not the Dr. fucking Phil.
[185:51.69]How... What would the view count be if I put on repeat the Dr. Phil theme song for a full hour?
[186:03.10]What would the viewer count look like one hour from now?
[186:14.79]I would... Yeah.
[186:15.73]I would say somewhere around like 1.4.
[186:16.59]Like 1,400. 1,400.
[186:22.02]And, follow-up question, would any of those people come back that left?
[186:28.30]Ever again?
[186:34.58]I don't think so.
[186:42.32]Even some of you guys that are saying, oh yeah, Nell, that'd be so funny, do it, you'd leave.
[186:47.80]You'd be here for 20 minutes and then you'd go, fuck man, there's something else I can probably be doing right now.
[186:54.46]You'd leave too.
[186:57.16]I'd leave.
[186:57.54]And I have the stream turned on.
[187:00.54]I would just get up.
[187:01.72]Then go, like, walk my dog.
[187:17.04]Report the stream.
[187:18.28]If you did that.
[187:20.97]What's the drop-down menu when you report a stream?
[187:23.91]Oh, okay, we got, uh, offensive, uh, bad, uh, he's naked.
[187:27.32]He's playing Dr. Phil for ten hours.
[187:50.15]If you want, you can file reports.
[187:52.51]Describe how you think certain people were murdered.
[187:54.19]If you put people's ID tags in your chest, you get extra cash.
[188:00.68]What?
[188:06.38]That's so cool.
[188:07.10]Is that real?
[188:16.74]Alright, so we have successfully cleaned up this area.
[188:21.36]The area that I caused a huge problem in.
[188:24.64]Nothing in here, right?
[188:25.36]Empty?
[188:25.90]Ooh, a couple of bullets.
[188:27.62]Just dump them out in here.
[188:32.52]That's stuck.
[188:35.04]Whatever.
[188:37.64]I can get another one.
[188:44.17]When am I gonna go on the Dr. Phil show?
[188:47.94]I'm not.
[188:48.75]I don't have any plans to.
[188:56.85]How's this room looking?
[189:00.30]Not good.
[189:12.67]That's stuck in my head now.
[189:14.21]What?
[189:23.67]He said he'd love to have you.
[189:27.21]What would we talk about?
[189:30.19]Why do I have to go on the show?
[189:31.25]There has to be a reason.
[189:46.45]Jerma, I'm done with you not listening.
[189:48.48]Play the Portal 2 soundtrack.
[189:55.94]What?
[189:57.54]I'm done with you not listening.
[189:59.46]Put on the Portal 2 soundtrack.
[190:14.26]Give me a minute.
[190:17.58]Make sure I cleaned up all the blood and the guts.
[190:20.34]I think I did.
[190:21.05]Ceiling doesn't have anything on it.
[190:24.64]Do it.
[190:24.92]This is my stream.
[190:27.18]Oh, is it?
[190:27.62]Oh, I was unaware!
[190:32.10]Is it now?
[190:44.59]Dump.
[190:46.69]Dump it.
[190:52.79]I missed under the bed.
[190:53.57]I know, I gotta dump this.
[190:57.47]There's blood behind you, idiot.
[190:58.59]Idiot.
[190:58.91]Stupid idiot.
[191:00.81]There's blood there.
[191:01.51]Dumb idiot.
[191:02.19]Stupid dumb idiot.
[191:16.64]Where?
[191:16.88]I don't see any blood.
[191:17.80]I don't see any blood.
[191:45.14]Relax.
[191:50.42]Are you mocking us?
[191:54.50]Yes.
[192:09.01]Well, I can't mock you guys sometimes.
[192:12.55]You know, I look over in this chat, and sometimes all I see is M-O-C-K-I-N-G.
[192:19.47]Sometimes that's the only thing I see.
[192:25.07]So if you can't take the heat, then take a couple of cooking classes, and maybe you'll get better.
[192:37.72]Hey, you know how many times I've had somebody doctor a fucking photo of me at five feet tall?
[192:44.21]I can't do an Elvis uh-huh impression?
[192:46.99]Making a little joke?
[192:51.18]Well, that's not allowed!
[193:08.76]What?
[193:09.06]Meltdown?
[193:09.74]What?
[193:10.32]This is not a meltdown.
[193:11.32]A meltdown is... Start fucking talking like this.
[193:18.63]No, I mean it's... It's like just... It's fucking stupid.
[193:22.17]And I just... I can't fucking do it right now, so... That's a... That's how you know.
[193:34.27]My voice drops to like this, and it's like fucking, I don't know what the fuck, and I swear every other sentence, every other word.
[193:50.30]No, this game just wasn't fucking so stupid, like, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[193:55.51]Like, I don't, I fucking don't, like, fucking even care about this fucking stupid game.
[194:05.49]It might be time for a break, because I don't know man, like I'm fucking... You know what I'm saying?
[194:11.00]It might be time for a fucking break.
[194:29.11]Is that really loud?
[194:29.83]I'm sorry guys, seriously.
[194:36.02]Did I peak the mic?
[194:39.12]Shit, I'm sorry.
[194:41.28]I actually am sorry, I hate when that happens.
[194:44.67]I just forget.
[194:46.49]Sorry, I'm like, peaking the microphone.
[194:50.57]Alright, this is a fucking dumb fucking game, man.
[194:54.95]It's like, funny it fucking the first five times, but just seriously.
[194:57.99]It's getting so fucking irritating.
[195:00.63]Fucking give me a break.
[195:03.69]Give me a fucking break!
[195:13.14]Fucking Jesus.
[195:14.48]I don't like this joke.
[195:36.72]What's he so mad?
[195:38.20]No, I'm doing a pretend mad.
[195:40.60]When sometimes I've been actually mad.
[195:42.66]That's how you can tell.
[195:49.83]What would possibly be causing me to be mad right now?
[195:52.89]He's pretending in quotes.
[195:54.47]I'm like picking up thumb drives.
[196:05.45]What?
[196:05.79]No, I'm just kidding.
[196:07.07]You guys know I'm kidding.
[196:09.88]What the heck are you talking about?
[196:15.32]Bad Elvis impression.
[196:17.28]Oh, now you got me boiling.
[196:35.94]Be real for once in your life?
[196:37.30]What?
[196:41.40]Be real for once in your life?
[196:43.12]This guy hates his viewers.
[196:47.40]I don't.
[196:48.26]That's not true.
[196:50.23]Don't say such incorrect things.
[196:54.75]So this room is pretty much done.
[197:00.99]Yep.
[197:01.47]Okay.
[197:02.05]Mm-hmm.
[197:03.65]Mm-hmm.
[197:04.73]Mm-hmm.
[197:11.08]What's wrong?
[197:14.27]Is it talking about the broom?
[197:15.15]Do I have to throw the broom away?
[197:23.05]Med kits, med kits.
[197:23.91]What are you- oh, you're putting in the mad?
[197:27.19]No, if you clicked on this and you didn't have any context... Funny it fucking the first five times, but just seriously.
[197:34.12]It's getting so fucking irritating.
[197:36.78]Fucking give me a break.
[197:39.82]Give me a fucking break.
[197:49.29]Fucking Jesus.
[197:54.39]Who says I'm not a good actor?
[198:11.96]There's text-to-speech in the game.
[198:13.28]Oh yeah.
[198:14.30]Forgot about that.
[198:20.57]You're gonna fight a dog?
[198:21.55]I'm not even gonna read that out loud.
[198:23.07]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[198:26.07]I gotta pay attention before another meltdown comes up!
[198:42.46]I was looking over a chat.
[198:47.29]Oops.
[198:53.49]Ah, and it's everywhere now.
[198:54.89]Come on.
[198:56.19]It's this dump room.
[198:58.78]Unfunny- It's not a spill joke.
[199:00.60]It's me looking at the chat.
[199:01.96]A fucking stupid fucking dumb fucking game.
[199:14.61]He spilled the thing.
[199:15.87]Yeah, I know.
[199:16.95]And I know you're giving me the... I know what that means now.
[199:19.72]I know what the forehead emote means now.
[199:22.50]I thought people thought it was hilarious, some of the shit that I was doing.
[199:24.98]Nope.
[199:26.94]That's the kappa of LUL.
[199:30.75]I get it now.
[199:43.36]Okay, let's bring this.
[199:47.05]Okay, we're almost done.
[199:58.19]Come here!
[199:58.57]Come here!
[199:58.93]I have to, like, knock those around, don't I?
[200:02.30]Crap.
[200:03.18]Oh, crap.
[200:10.68]I can reach this one.
[200:14.74]Sound it out?
[200:15.12]What do you mean, sound it out?
[200:15.96]Sound out what?
[200:19.20]Remember when people used to do Kappa?
[200:22.00]People still do it.
[200:22.86]I see it from time to time.
[200:28.84]I need some more incinerators.
[200:35.38]You didn't clean the outside of the building.
[200:43.44]Fuck you.
[200:44.36]No, no, no.
[200:54.83]No, that's not... Stop taking me out of context.
[200:58.27]This happened two days ago, too.
[201:11.37]Alright, clean, clean, clean.
[201:13.52]We're almost ready to go to the next step.
[201:17.08]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[201:18.80]There's body parts in here.
[201:43.62]He's losing it.
[201:44.96]I'm not losing it.
[201:48.50]I'm not losing it.
[201:50.52]He's losing it.
[201:59.63]This feels like a VR game.
[202:01.13]It is!
[202:01.45]You didn't know I was in VR?
[202:04.83]I'm doing very well for how goofy it is to hold these move controllers.
[202:24.09]I hate when they're like that.
[202:24.89]I gotta get on top and knock them this way.
[202:37.39]Is it out?
[202:43.59]Shit!
[202:47.42]Get out from there!
[202:50.12]Can I pick you up over this way?
[202:51.12]I hope so.
[202:58.12]Ah, that felt good.
[202:58.91]That was like removing a rotten tooth.
[203:09.79]Play a more calming, tranquil game?
[203:12.67]This is kind of the epitome of a tranquil, just calm game.
[203:16.75]Isn't it?
[203:17.03]That's just not gonna happen.
[203:26.94]I'm just gonna...
[203:29.30]Bring it out here.
[203:31.30]Sit it on the gurney.
[203:34.76]Blood's everywhere.
[203:35.50]It's totally calm.
[203:36.28]I mean, it's relaxing to just clean.
[203:38.12]I'm just relaxing.
[203:41.82]How much of the upstairs have you done?
[203:42.86]Um... I don't know.
[203:46.43]90% maybe?
[203:46.67]Something like that?
[203:56.43]Maybe 95%?
[204:08.06]If it's so tranquil, why are you losing your shit?
[204:12.52]This is just what happens when I play Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[204:17.06]We just start talking about anything.
[204:23.88]And that's it.
[204:24.52]We just hang out.
[204:25.95]Have fun.
[204:34.75]That looks good.
[204:36.31]Under the table, under the table.
[204:40.33]There is a meat chunk that's sitting there.
[204:47.49]And where's my box?
[204:48.53]There it is.
[204:51.37]Missed two on the step.
[204:54.41]Missed step two there, pal.
[204:57.94]What?
[204:59.22]What's step two?
[205:06.80]Pal, I don't know what you mean.
[205:08.34]What do you mean?
[205:16.62]Looks good.
[205:18.88]The ward.
[205:19.50]Almost done with the ward.
[205:20.40]Okay.
[205:31.61]I wish I could turn... This is gonna give me anxiety, man.
[205:34.41]I gotta turn that over.
[205:35.25]I wish I could pick it up.
[205:39.52]Nothing on the ceiling.
[205:40.38]Okay.
[205:48.75]Did I miss any other blood?
[205:50.63]I don't think I did.
[205:51.85]Looks good, looks good, looks good, looks good.
[205:53.39]Is that... dirty?
[206:01.80]Or is it reflection?
[206:02.54]I think it's reflection.
[206:07.90]Portal 2 OST.
[206:10.62]Ah!
[206:10.74]I just said it.
[206:14.20]Shit.
[206:14.82]I'm supposed to not ever say that again.
[206:16.00]Just gonna set this down over here.
[206:25.41]I need some med kit to go right there.
[206:31.28]Gimme.
[206:46.65]Clean that up.
[206:48.25]You, the incinerators right here, might as well just drop it in.
[206:52.89]New Year's resolution failed.
[206:54.23]I don't think so.
[206:57.43]What was my actual New Year's resolution?
[206:58.91]You guys heard it.
[206:59.75]Wasn't it something different?
[207:00.91]Something else?
[207:08.08]Didn't I say it like two days ago?
[207:12.16]Oh, installing a better Twitch TV.
[207:13.68]That's right.
[207:16.04]As long as I just do that at some point during the year, then it's fine.
[207:20.69]I could do that on December 29th, 2019.
[207:24.63]I still did it.
[207:29.87]This one is done, right?
[207:31.09]Just want to make sure.
[207:32.43]Done.
[207:33.87]There's a bucket in here, though.
[207:36.86]Let's just double-check.
[207:45.65]forget.
[207:45.95]No, it'll be fine.
[207:47.83]I'll get it.
[207:54.07]Dermot's been alive for four hours and this is not even halfway done.
[207:59.67]Well, we're going to have to finish it.
[208:02.45]Regardless of how long it takes and how many things we do, this game has nudity.
[208:09.86]That's not what you said.
[208:10.62]You said, was this game made in unity?
[208:12.52]I'm not sure where my mind went there.
[208:22.97]Clean, clean, clean.
[208:24.17]We only got the one little upstairs area.
[208:31.79]Clear out the downstairs.
[208:33.73]Press a couple of buttons.
[208:37.22]Alright, wait.
[208:38.04]I still gotta go.
[208:41.26]Missed a spot.
[208:42.10]We can triple check.
[208:44.32]I'll come back down here.
[208:45.08]We're gonna go through with the... Ghostbusters meter.
[208:48.56]We'll find whatever needs to be found.
[208:51.60]This, on the other hand, needs to be cleaned up bad.
[208:53.94]What are the empty ones?
[208:57.32]This one's kind of dirty.
[208:58.52]Stick it in there.
[209:01.89]Okay.
[209:02.95]Empty.
[209:03.37]Stick it in there.
[209:03.95]Okay.
[209:08.99]I need a med kit.
[209:10.47]Let's go one more pass to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[209:17.88]Might as well pull it out just to look.
[209:24.11]There ain't nothing here.
[209:28.77]Just spotless.
[209:30.69]Guaranteed.
[209:31.31]Alright.
[209:50.62]Stack this up and let's get the hell out of here.
[209:52.90]And move on.
[210:04.72]I don't like how this is... Tip it this way.
[210:07.19]What the fuck, man?
[210:08.75]Tip it... I wanted to tip it the other way.
[210:11.39]That didn't even tip over.
[210:12.67]I'm... Be real with me.
[210:17.27]That didn't even tip over.
[210:18.61]It was just barely... I was moving it around.
[210:31.64]They're all empty anyways.
[210:32.44]Doesn't fucking matter now.
[210:36.63]Hehe, very funny.
[210:37.53]I mean, I honestly was just trying to get it so I wasn't gonna tip over, but... You know.
[210:52.10]Oh, what a silly- what silly stuff he's doing right now.
[210:55.26]I want fresh buckets.
[211:06.67]This is new, but I'm going to bring them over there.
[211:12.79]Okay, nice and clean.
[211:14.51]Get in there.
[211:14.97]Alright, I'm about to play the Portal 2 OST for as long as it takes to get the fastest gnome in the world.
[211:30.47]You're going to get like a...
[211:34.78]But, except it's the first song in Portal 2.
[211:36.56]Okay.
[211:47.28]A little out here, a little bit over here, on the wall.
[211:51.72]We're almost done!
[211:55.26]There's only about five minutes left.
[212:00.90]This looks good, I need a med kit.
[212:09.07]Done.
[212:10.01]Good.
[212:10.73]Goodbye.
[212:13.62]Need a health pack for that room.
[212:14.76]But I'm gonna go through at the very end and make sure to change everything and fix everything.
[212:19.26]So don't worry.
[212:21.66]Moving on.
[212:24.18]What do we got here?
[212:26.59]This door cannot be opened.
[212:28.71]There's nothing even in here.
[212:29.57]It's just for show.
[212:31.91]Further down.
[212:34.53]Also, this door is locked.
[212:36.29]Nothing even in there, so that's good.
[212:38.01]I thought I had way more to do.
[212:41.67]I need some buckets.
[212:48.03]The gun is right here.
[212:49.17]Alright, I'll do the bullet holes, okay?
[212:57.89]How do you do them?
[213:07.94]I'm about to start a fire, hold on.
[213:12.67]There.
[213:14.21]Now everybody can exhale.
[213:22.00]What do you mean, we got him?
[213:37.39]Oh, we got him.
[213:38.79]He's doing the thing he's supposed to do.
[213:40.69]We'll do the rest later.
[213:42.01]I know there's more.
[213:42.71]Alright.
[213:53.26]Give me the bucket.
[213:54.54]How much real estate can I clear with just this little bucket?
[213:59.32]Do people need the portal, too, or we're gonna starve?
[214:02.16]What's that have to do with you eating food?
[214:13.93]Alright, go like this.
[214:17.23]Not... Okay, not gonna do it yet.
[214:20.07]I want to clear this out and then get a few new buckets.
[214:22.63]I'm not gonna spill them.
[214:23.71]I'm gonna try as hard as I can to not.
[214:26.61]I promise.
[214:27.13]I'm not gonna spill it, run too fast.
[214:30.91]I'm gonna walk with like four or five buckets.
[214:34.09]I'm gonna take it slow.
[214:34.89]Because this is now clean.
[214:37.52]I don't have to worry about this little corridor anymore.
[214:39.56]Good!
[214:48.48]It didn't even happen.
[215:03.93]Why are you guys so funny?
[215:06.35]I'm sorry to the people that might be new to the stream that think that I'm doing this on purpose.
[215:12.77]It's not on purpose.
[215:18.40]Why?
[215:18.68]Give me... You are!
[215:20.92]I'm not!
[215:33.47]There are people that... There are people who aren't knowing that... Wait, what?
[215:49.09]Come on, get in there.
[215:49.73]Don't do this.
[216:00.86]Did they all spill?
[216:02.22]No.
[216:09.42]Okay.
[216:10.00]I got four.
[216:10.64]Alright.
[216:16.03]Alright.
[216:24.03]I'm holding shift.
[216:26.95]That feels like it's gonna spill, right?
[216:30.39]Is it?
[216:30.83]No, it's not, okay.
[216:49.17]Okay, put it down gently.
[216:56.18]See, I told you I was gonna try to not have that be a thing.
[217:25.37]See?
[217:33.40]It so badly wants to do it.
[217:35.44]Don't do it though.
[217:36.28]Okay.
[217:49.27]This should take me all the way up to the stairs.
[217:51.01]That should be good.
[218:00.10]Feels pretty good.
[218:04.91]Please play Portal 2.
[218:06.43]I'm so hungry.
[218:29.64]I don't even have- I don't have a response to that.
[218:31.48]That is so dumb.
[218:33.42]I have no response to what you guys are saying to this.
[218:41.06]I can't even think about it.
[218:55.78]Here, eat up!
[219:16.43]Thank you, we can eat.
[219:17.29]Good.
[219:18.71]I'm glad you can eat.
[219:20.87]Eat it.
[219:21.12]My OST is a little dry.
[219:32.46]Can I get a refund?
[219:41.37]No.
[219:42.91]No refunds.
[219:54.28]Look at how close we are.
[219:55.16]Okay, this- how do I- how do I say- look at- the guy got employees on site.
[220:00.29]No, what?
[220:00.71]Okay, I'm full.
[220:06.59]Stop.
[220:06.91]No, you- you eat it.
[220:07.93]You finish your vegetables.
[220:09.95]You gotta eat it all.
[220:26.24]I'm too full.
[220:28.64]This is the first song.
[220:29.58]You ate like one carrot.
[220:32.87]You have a full plate of food right now.
[220:55.57]Worst joke contender?
[220:57.07]This is not my... I didn't do this.
[220:59.09]This is... Are you talking about for chat?
[221:04.78]Because this is a chat thing.
[221:05.88]This is not a Jeremy thing.
[221:21.67]Okay.
[221:28.56]Getting close.
[221:31.67]So close.
[221:34.11]Uh, I'm not gonna be able to take that.
[221:35.13]Let's just go dump it.
[221:38.17]And then bring another one.
[221:38.95]I'm gonna get... I can only bring one.
[221:47.87]Good.
[221:48.31]Good.
[221:49.75]Get rid of this bucket, too.
[221:51.49]I don't need it.
[221:51.93]Can't believe I'm watching this guy live.
[221:58.74]Welcome to the stream!
[221:59.50]Hope you're having a good one!
[222:13.50]Is it gonna work?
[222:20.51]Yep.
[222:24.17]Is this pre-recorded?
[222:26.61]No!
[222:29.19]Is it?
[222:32.25]No, shit, it is.
[222:34.21]No, it is.
[222:34.65]I'm at the beach right now, I forgot.
[222:38.61]I made sure to have a pre-recorded stream, because I'm at the beach.
[222:40.87]I wanted to make sure I had something for today, you know?
[222:54.08]Um... I can't pick this up.
[223:00.15]Can I not pick that up?
[223:07.23]I'm not, my hands are off the keyboard right now.
[223:20.18]Almost to the spawn, and then we are done!
[223:26.14]With the Verse Floor.
[223:43.85]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[223:49.68]And then I can take the elevator up.
[223:52.12]And we can do the door floor.
[223:57.29]I love seeing the progress.
[223:59.25]This is where I started.
[224:00.09]Here's the spawn.
[224:01.57]Look at how clean it is down here.
[224:02.79]There's no blood.
[224:05.39]Remember this shit?
[224:05.93]How bad it looked?
[224:16.95]You get to really see your progress.
[224:18.40]It's great.
[224:21.34]The limb box.
[224:23.26]I think I can just bring this over there now.
[224:24.58]Wait, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[224:32.80]Good.
[224:37.70]I gained 62 viewers from the Dr. Phil music.
[224:40.51]That's incredibly specific.
[224:50.54]That's very... Okay, here's the computer.
[224:51.84]I'm gonna put the thumb drives in there eventually.
[224:56.13]Maybe I should turn this into a thumb drive box.
[224:59.05]No, no, no, no.
[225:00.11]Just dump it in here.
[225:15.38]That was just a dog running with his bone into the door.
[225:19.00]Fuck.
[225:22.17]I'm not sure I can put this in here.
[225:41.66]What the fuck are you doing?
[225:42.62]Open!
[225:47.20]Can I close the lid on this thing?
[225:55.14]Again.
[225:57.01]I didn't know it had its own animation.
[226:02.99]It's gonna get a little sloppy over here anyways.
[226:04.49]Don't worry.
[226:11.26]No, no.
[226:11.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[226:12.14]What do you mean no?
[226:12.74]Don't do that.
[226:13.14]Don't do that.
[226:13.48]Why?
[226:15.62]What?
[226:16.62]Why?
[226:17.10]Why?
[226:25.96]Don't burn that.
[226:32.71]I needed that.
[226:33.65]Did I though?
[226:34.19]Can I just get another one?
[226:40.31]Use it to save items.
[226:43.80]Whatever, it's okay.
[226:49.22]Wasn't there one of these in here?
[226:57.08]I didn't know.
[226:59.80]Everything in this game is a box.
[227:01.28]It can be used.
[227:01.86]Alright, almost time to go upstairs.
[227:12.81]Clean, clean, clean.
[227:14.37]Alright.
[227:19.07]Time to go upstairs.
[227:29.47]We'll find the little bits that are still around later.
[227:32.85]Might as well put this in.
[227:36.31]Got it.
[227:36.55]Okay.
[227:40.34]I missed a spot at the end.
[227:41.28]It's okay.
[227:43.74]I can clean it all up, take care of it later.
[227:47.32]That's locked up.
[227:50.17]I need a medpack for that.
[227:52.03]Let's get rid of this, get another one.
[227:57.97]I'm just gonna dump it.
[228:04.77]I missed a $50 donation earlier, did I really?
[228:12.32]Where did I miss that?
[228:19.43]Comfort Eagle?
[228:20.63]We touched on Comfort Eagle, didn't we?
[228:24.17]I missed 4,000 donation.
[228:24.93]When?
[228:33.02]Somebody gave $4,000?
[228:33.98]I don't remember that.
[228:43.49]Oh, you baited.
[228:44.13]Oh, that's funny.
[228:44.85]Alright.
[228:54.89]I didn't even dump this shit.
[228:55.83]That's what I came in here for.
[228:58.05]New box, fresh box, fresh water.
[229:11.13]I can't do it again.
[229:14.45]Fresh water.
[229:16.59]Fresh box.
[229:17.47]And let's take the ride upstairs.
[229:22.59]Thanks for nothing.
[229:24.43]No, I'm gonna put... We need to bring a lot of stuff up here.
[229:27.18]I need to think about this logically.
[229:31.86]Because I have to come all the way back down.
[229:33.56]We're gonna do eight buckets.
[229:36.72]And three...
[229:40.19]Eight buckets and three... No, I can only do one.
[229:49.48]Are there no buckets upstairs?
[229:50.50]Didn't look like it when we were there before.
[229:58.84]Save the game, thank you.
[230:05.82]Turn footprints off.
[230:06.84]Ah, it's too late now.
[230:14.57]Alright, two in the other... I gotta make sure I can fit.
[230:19.13]Can I fit a couple of boxes in here still?
[230:22.01]We'll find out in a minute.
[230:31.12]Oh, please.
[230:43.36]Two more.
[230:55.07]Here comes a meltdown.
[230:58.01]No, that's not gonna be... I'll be fine.
[231:01.24]Two more, and then I might as well get that animation going, so I can do this 1, 2, 3 style.
[231:05.84]There we go.
[231:10.28]Get it in there.
[231:58.99]Yes!
[232:10.45]Can only fit two in here.
[232:23.57]Jesus!
[232:28.57]That's too much raw meat for me to take in.
[232:36.99]Okay, now if I just get in here, close the door... Here we go.
[232:45.58]Up.
[232:53.03]Oh, there's so much up here.
[232:55.34]How much is up here?
[232:57.58]Okay, no, it's not that much.
[233:03.86]It is not that much.
[233:04.85]It's just a lot.
[233:05.81]It's not that much.
[233:08.45]It's a lot, but it's not a lot.
[233:12.57]Primary objective, eliminate the crazed Dr. Mord.
[233:14.92]Make a big fucking mess.
[233:16.62]This area of the medical facility is where Dr. Mord and his associates created the mutant hybrids.
[233:21.56]Find and eliminate the mad doctor and all his creations.
[233:24.04]What?
[233:31.93]Okay.
[233:34.21]This one's not gonna be that bad.
[233:36.29]I'll tell you for one very specific reason why.
[233:41.38]Who am I kidding?
[233:41.74]It's gonna be horrible.
[233:43.33]I'm gonna put every body part in a corner.
[233:49.16]And then I'm gonna come up here with a gun and I'm gonna light the whole fucking place on fire.
[233:52.60]We're gonna make a bonfire of body parts.
[234:12.80]Imagine the smell.
[234:13.58]I don't even want to.
[234:15.34]It'd be fucking horrible.
[234:24.88]Uh, door control locked.
[234:28.66]Can't go in that one.
[234:32.46]This door.
[234:33.86]Door control, please enter code.
[234:37.80]Oh no.
[234:55.37]Why would you guys do that?
[235:13.48]I just cheated.
[235:16.30]Alright.
[235:23.67]Back to what I was doing.
[235:24.97]Over here.
[235:29.27]I got so many buckets, we're gonna clean it all so quickly.
[235:34.65]Just get everything out of the way and we're doing- I'm gonna make a trail of buckets and I'm going to do this faster than- that guy broke into a million pieces.
[235:44.00]I've burnt the code.
[235:48.70]You make a mistake sometimes.
[235:54.94]Any more pieces?
[235:57.06]Yeah, this shit is over here.
[235:58.40]Hold on, I gotta put the bullets.
[236:00.76]That's too many of them.
[236:03.42]There's no vacuum cleaner I can use?
[236:04.78]I have to pick each one of these up individually?
[236:10.10]No, I'm gonna get out of this very quickly.
[236:12.26]It's... We're almost at the 4 hour mark.
[236:15.67]This is gonna take less than 20 minutes.
[236:19.39]20 minutes from now it's going to happen.
[236:21.25]Because I'm going to do this so strategically.
[236:23.41]I'm going to line everything up.
[236:24.25]I'm going to do it very fast.
[236:27.35]Just watch.
[236:28.19]It'll be right this time.
[236:29.77]I'll get it this time.
[236:33.87]I'll be ready to get out of here.
[236:35.15]Put this in the elevator.
[236:39.48]Just got to get rid of all the stray shit everywhere.
[236:42.02]Corner to corner?
[236:45.94]Yeah.
[236:46.06]I'm going to do the whole thing.
[236:52.73]And then we're gonna take all the dirty shit down in the elevator.
[236:56.05]I need the gun though.
[236:59.67]Alright, 30 minutes.
[237:00.85]Add 10 minutes for the- I gotta go get the gun.
[237:09.51]Just sweep it all under a bed.
[237:11.13]They're gonna dock points for that.
[237:22.83]Alright, arm... Let's just take care... So I don't track blood everywhere.
[237:26.80]Let me take care of this shit first.
[237:30.54]I'm gonna start in this area here, and I'm gonna go in.
[237:33.86]So I won't run blood all over the place.
[237:43.30]Alright, need my buckets.
[237:44.04]I'm gonna go one bucket at a time.
[237:52.50]First bucket.
[237:53.56]Right in the middle.
[237:56.33]Bucket number two.
[237:56.91]10 feet, 15 feet forward.
[238:10.84]Bucket number three.
[238:13.52]Another about 10, 15 feet forward.
[238:19.42]And then the next one will be down there.
[238:22.40]That's four buckets should get the whole thing done with that.
[238:24.53]So I'm never more than five feet, ten feet away from a bucket.
[238:30.37]Here we go.
[238:31.01]Check it.
[238:31.61]One.
[238:32.35]Two.
[238:33.35]Three.
[238:33.69]Begin.
[238:48.16]RPG planning?
[238:50.66]I mean, I play RPGs.
[238:54.16]I downloaded the Witcher 3.
[239:05.62]Alright, this one's done.
[239:09.13]I'm gonna have to set it here for now.
[239:10.91]Keep going.
[239:16.13]Holy fuck, it's so dirty up here.
[239:19.85]I'm gonna have to use all eight buckets here.
[239:34.25]Damn.
[239:34.61]Is that thing moving?
[239:42.49]Who's talking?
[239:49.53]Um... Okay, over here?
[240:03.65]If I can just get this whole thing.
[240:04.77]I don't need to come because I don't want to track shit everywhere.
[240:08.06]There we go.
[240:10.36]Somebody left their Xbox mic on and their mom came into the room.
[240:30.59]Alright, it's almost getting to the point where I need four more buckets.
[240:45.34]Yeah, oh, this is bad.
[240:46.98]I wasn't even close.
[240:49.26]I wasn't even close.
[241:01.59]That's not in right.
[241:07.23]When I pick it up, it should straighten itself out.
[241:08.97]Alright, I've got one more bucket over here, don't I?
[241:10.49]Yep, right here.
[241:22.65]Omega Spill is incoming.
[241:27.07]No, there's not going to be an Omega Spill.
[241:30.35]I told you, 30 minutes.
[241:38.43]It's gonna take the other buckets, but that's why I brought eight.
[241:42.34]And then we're gonna bring them all down stacked into the incinerator.
[241:56.01]Could you please do it on purpose like last time?
[242:08.59]Alright, we're almost ready to get the next set of buckets out here.
[242:15.19]Not quite, almost.
[242:16.01]Alright, we need to replace.
[242:25.17]Wait, I think I can do one more?
[242:28.25]Yeah, last one.
[242:36.94]That's it.
[242:40.10]He didn't deny it?
[242:41.02]I didn't deny what?
[242:41.94]That it was an intentional spill?
[242:44.71]It wasn't an intentional spill.
[242:48.31]Perfect.
[242:48.65]Alright.
[242:49.81]Before I go, I'm gonna get this out.
[242:53.09]And then get these out too.
[242:54.97]No, get these in.
[243:01.29]Fuck.
[243:01.79]It's tipping, it's tipping, it's tipping, it's tipping.
[243:03.29]Which way do I have to do it?
[243:21.29]I'm ready.
[243:38.31]Don't take him out like this.
[243:40.79]I'm fucked.
[243:41.83]I fucked it all up.
[243:43.25]I think I fucked the whole thing up.
[243:44.77]Nope, thank god.
[243:52.37]Bang.
[244:03.74]Time check, how long's it been?
[244:06.70]10 minutes?
[244:15.56]That hasn't been 30 minutes.
[244:17.86]No way.
[244:18.34]That has not been that long.
[244:29.46]You know how bad this looked?
[244:31.26]Not even five minutes ago.
[244:32.20]I still got three buckets.
[244:44.09]It's been eight minutes.
[244:45.71]Would you look at that?
[244:47.27]I still got plenty of time.
[244:50.45]Nothing spilled, nothing fucked up, nothing stupid happened.
[244:56.22]This place is almost clean.
[244:57.10]Alright, that one's done, but I can get the ceiling.
[245:10.09]Hasn't happened yet.
[245:11.99]Why do you think it's going to happen?
[245:15.30]It's not going to happen.
[245:16.34]Look at how much better that looks.
[245:20.35]I've only been here for a few minutes.
[245:24.53]I spilt the mop.
[245:26.87]Now here's the real question.
[245:27.61]I gotta just keep these over here in the corner.
[245:43.50]That's okay.
[245:44.14]That's not the end of the world.
[245:48.48]It's only two buckets.
[245:49.86]Don't worry.
[245:50.14]It's not the end of the world.
[245:56.95]Not the end of the world.
[246:02.31]Why is it bubbling?
[246:02.97]Why is it boiling in there?
[246:04.03]It shouldn't be.
[246:04.65]Why is it doing that?
[246:06.85]Why is this thing bubbling around?
[246:09.89]Sit in there.
[246:11.92]Sit in there.
[246:13.18]Good.
[246:23.95]It's so dark, I can't see.
[246:24.99]That's not gonna work, so I'm just gonna put it down.
[246:33.46]Like a normal human.
[246:34.36]Alright, I still got a bucket.
[246:37.36]Still one bucket remaining, everything's fine.
[246:40.98]It really is not- That's what I wanted!
[246:42.14]I wanted to get at least this part done.
[246:44.32]Now we can clean up a little bit.
[246:46.08]Get the last little bits.
[246:56.02]Are you fucking serious?
[247:00.06]You can use the toilet.
[247:01.04]Okay, that changes everything.
[247:21.37]No, I'm not supposed to be doing it like this.
[247:29.74]Nah, get this out of here.
[247:30.40]I'm not supposed to be doing it like that.
[247:38.12]Okay.
[247:38.40]No!
[247:38.54]The bullets were in there!
[247:40.20]Shit!
[247:49.13]It's alright.
[247:55.63]Give me that thing.
[247:56.19]I need to bring it back.
[247:56.85]It's a good transport.
[248:08.48]Replace the toilet seats?
[248:11.60]In time.
[248:12.70]In time.
[248:13.06]I need to get rid of the trash first.
[248:27.39]15 minutes left?
[248:27.99]I got plenty of time!
[248:30.59]I'm almost done.
[248:38.28]And now it's just a question of just dunking it.
[248:47.43]This is good.
[248:47.99]Just gotta replace the seats.
[248:49.57]Do I?
[248:49.71]Why would I?
[248:50.15]I don't even need to do that.
[249:03.89]Looks pretty clean to me.
[249:07.59]leaves us with this room.
[249:08.73]I just want to get the blood and shit.
[249:11.81]That's most important.
[249:16.01]What's that doing?
[249:16.93]Need a light.
[249:35.95]Not very much blood in here, though.
[249:37.48]So that's good.
[249:43.18]Yeah, this is clean.
[249:45.22]This shit is clean, clean, clean.
[249:48.91]Just gotta pick up the body.
[249:53.07]And throw him into the body dump.
[250:11.41]Alright, let's bring this.
[250:18.34]Okay.
[250:19.00]That whole thing's getting burnt, so don't worry.
[250:32.13]There's something flickering.
[250:33.97]Yes, it's a light.
[250:35.17]It's this light.
[250:41.88]Look at vent.
[250:45.46]Look at vent.
[250:47.14]What?
[250:47.88]There's something in the vent.
[250:51.20]Which vent?
[250:57.99]Oh, there is something in the vent, you're right.
[251:05.85]Is that alive?
[251:09.86]Is this thing still alive?
[251:11.08]Do I have to burn this, don't I?
[251:16.89]Is it alive?
[251:22.75]No, it's dead.
[251:25.07]There's blood up here now, though.
[251:31.39]I gotta go get the gun.
[251:33.95]I don't want to pick this up.
[251:37.05]Disgusting.
[251:41.15]that actually I hated that okay clean clean clean now we just bring the fire gun up here and burn the whole thing so what does that leave us with I need to make sure I have enough of these here
[252:10.81]Okay, so I need to bring up how many medkits?
[252:13.51]One or two?
[252:15.07]Two?
[252:17.79]There's one, two.
[252:22.49]And... I have... I can clean my brush in the toilet, so... I should be able to clean the rest of that.
[252:28.77]I don't think I need buckets.
[252:30.69]I am going to leave this one up here, though, because this one still has some water in it, so I'm going to leave it.
[252:34.97]Take this.
[252:36.72]Get it over there.
[252:37.34]And... Get this fucking thing out of here, too.

[252:47.16]And get out of here.
[252:50.43]Flush the toilets.
[252:52.66]Can you flush the toilet?
[253:10.47]Oh, it was a lie.
[253:11.83]It was a lie.

[253:18.54]Back down.

[253:25.12]Let's do it.
[253:27.78]Whoa, easy!
[253:32.91]I cleaned all this shit up already.

[253:37.47]Oh right, now I remember.
[253:45.51]Alright, give me the gun.

[253:50.80]Where the hell is the gun?
[254:03.31]Where's the gun?
[254:15.83]What song is playing right now?
[254:18.97]Oh, the Portal 2 OST!
[254:22.72]It's been on for so long, I thought it was an in-game song and I wanted to turn it off.
[254:26.10]Alright, that's enough of that.
[254:45.72]Here's the Red Dead Redemption 2 OST.
[255:04.64]Why does everybody hate this?
[255:07.88]Hold on.
[255:09.06]You guys don't like this.
[255:17.77]You don't like this.
[255:23.67]I'm very... I can't believe it.
[255:25.19]Where am I going?
[255:30.59]I will hit her.

[255:52.35]Hey, alright there, hold on.
[255:53.97]Ooh, almost spill-joked.
[255:57.57]Almost- alright.
[256:00.43]You try to tell me how that was possible that I didn't do it there.
[256:03.32]Okay?
[256:04.54]I don't know how, but it's gonna- it's close.
[256:08.29]Oh, here comes the GIGA spill.
[256:14.23]Nope, not gonna happen.
[256:15.75]Ready?
[256:47.22]It's alright.
[256:47.68]This can be cleaned easily.
[256:49.06]Oh, I'm tracking mud everywhere.
[256:50.88]No!
[257:06.59]There's so much mud.
[257:07.73]Nice.
[257:10.13]Excellent.
[257:10.53]Nice.
[257:11.06]Great.
[257:11.52]Cool.
[257:12.02]Great.
[257:12.52]Fun.
[257:14.82]Alright, I gotta get all this shit out of here.
[257:36.94]Did that spill?
[257:38.02]How did that spill?
[257:41.02]Two spill jokes.
[257:41.92]It's getting old.
[257:43.04]I'm not trying to do it.
[257:44.58]I'm carrying like four buckets at the same time.
[257:59.37]Upstairs is pretty much done.
[258:00.55]Just need to bring some toilets.
[258:11.70]I need these.
[258:12.79]I'm stashing them right here.
[258:14.11]I need this.
[258:24.73]Boomer music.
[258:28.56]Hey, get real, alright?
[258:44.86]Alright, how many toilet cups do we need?
[258:46.24]Just two?
[258:46.52]The fuck is this?
[259:03.20]It gave you an ad.
[259:04.36]Oh, okay.
[259:07.04]Yup.
[259:08.30]Alright, how many toilets do we need?
[259:12.99]I need... two?
[259:21.94]I need four!
[259:22.76]Oh, there's only two broken toilets in there.
[259:30.51]Alright, um... You mean light?
[259:48.33]I thought this was an LED!
[259:49.97]I don't know, it was like some- ayayay.
[259:54.49]Place it.
[259:55.17]Gently.
[259:56.61]Alright, that's- where are the toilets?
[260:00.79]Toilet seat one.
[260:03.27]Toilet seat two.
[260:07.81]Two, two, gun, light.
[260:15.39]Let's go.
[260:15.71]I don't need anything else, right?
[260:20.03]I don't think so.
[260:20.61]Let's go.
[260:28.60]Play Lisa?
[260:29.88]I've never even seen... I haven't played Lisa.
[260:32.64]Is that on?
[260:36.48]It's on, right?
[261:05.13]Okay, it's on.
[261:08.21]I didn't even need these.
[261:09.34]Alright, let's go.
[261:17.54]Ready?
[261:19.37]I'll give you a fucking OST.
[261:36.61]Here we go.
[261:38.85]Ghostbusters!
[261:43.33]If there's something strange in your neighborhood Who you gonna call?
[261:59.42]Ghostbusters!
[262:02.02]If there's something weird and it don't look good
[262:36.48]I don't know.
[262:37.94]There.
[262:43.38]Whoa, easy.
[262:43.94]Okay, here we go.
[262:48.52]You're curious of why the hell I just did that.
[262:50.45]Well, it's a very, very, very easy answer.
[262:53.47]There's so many body parts that just lighten the whole fucking thing on fire.
[262:58.29]I can just look at all these little meat cubes.
[262:59.79]It'll fit nicely in here.
[263:13.07]That wasn't even the right version.
[263:15.85]There's a correct version?
[263:16.87]What do you mean?
[263:24.32]Use the broom.
[263:31.89]What?
[263:32.49]Why am I doing this?
[263:37.83]How the hell?
[263:38.27]How is this gonna do anything for me?
[263:50.22]Wait a minute.
[264:21.60]That doesn't do shit.
[264:27.89]Now I get- there's like so many fucking dumb canisters on the ground.
[264:35.26]Play the Boston version.
[264:36.46]No.
[264:37.16]No, no more OSTs.
[264:40.12]I'm not gonna say that word for another fucking year.
[265:02.37]See?
[265:03.43]This turned out to be a good idea.
[265:07.67]I got toilet water to clean the walls.
[265:11.54]And we can be done.
[265:12.44]That's it.
[265:13.68]Is there a basement?
[265:14.60]There is one little basement.
[265:17.56]What was the estimated time?
[265:19.29]2.3?
[265:20.61]We're at 4.3?
[265:21.07]That's not bad.
[265:28.58]He's not doing it.
[265:29.96]He's not doing it.
[265:31.26]Why would I want to play that?
[265:34.09]Not right now.
[265:34.67]It's like 10 years.
[265:45.17]Almost every piece of meat is good to go.
[265:47.44]I had the exact correct amount of boxes that I needed for this job.
[265:54.73]Now, a spill here would be a catastrophe, so I have to make sure that doesn't happen.
[266:02.91]Actual catastrophe.
[266:04.71]This would cause a huge problem.
[266:07.04]This might be too big to put anywhere.
[266:08.70]I don't know if I'm okay with that, but whatever.
[266:19.79]Good.
[266:20.83]Exactly what I needed.
[266:22.98]So let's just go over here.
[266:25.50]I have the bucket still.
[266:26.84]Aye.
[266:39.57]Oh, riot.
[266:40.45]RIOT!
[266:41.27]RIOT!
[266:50.01]He's not going to do it.
[266:52.23]You know what to do.
[266:53.86]I need buckets up here.
[266:55.02]There's no way I'm going to do this with toilet water.
[267:03.50]No, there's no way.
[267:08.40]Why is this so dirty?
[267:10.60]What?
[267:15.44]What else?
[267:15.78]Oh, medkits.
[267:16.34]Right, get these in here.
[267:17.10]Do this now so I don't forget about it.
[267:43.72]Ray Parker Jr.
[267:44.96]Here we go, let's go!
[267:45.88]Okay.
[267:52.03]Give me this.
[268:22.73]I forgot.
[268:23.37]Alright, I'm gonna put the light down.
[268:40.51]I can't even hear.
[268:41.69]We're gonna bring this shit down.
[268:44.32]No, wait, where are the toilets?
[268:49.87]Where's the other one?
[268:55.53]Let me tell you something.
[269:03.10]Nope.
[269:03.82]What?
[269:04.78]I forgot how these- this soundtrack is.
[269:07.31]It's right here!
[269:08.57]Oh, sleeping!
[269:10.03]Yeah!
[269:48.03]This is all dirty!
[269:49.05]That stupid line!
[270:04.28]That line!
[270:21.15]Get me out!
[270:25.29]No!
[270:26.47]I ain't afraid of no bed!
[270:35.00]Where's the incinerator?
[270:39.00]I ain't afraid of no bed.
[270:51.59]God damn it.
[270:54.69]What do we got?
[270:55.85]Not even a big spill.
[271:25.12]It's fucking with my brain!
[271:27.86]I gotta turn it off.
[271:29.90]It's fucking with my brain.
[271:33.48]All I can hear is that.
[271:36.16]That was the end of the song anyways, we're fine.
[271:41.47]Oh my god, there's like five seconds left!
[271:53.73]There you go.
[271:57.02]All right.
[272:02.26]Well, there it was.
[272:10.24]My jaw hurts after that for some reason.
[272:26.27]This will be the final cleanup.
[272:29.43]Bucket of water.
[272:30.07]I need a bunch of water.
[272:31.20]Because there's no way I'm gonna get through that.
[272:34.60]Final cleanup.
[272:35.28]We'll do that final cleanup.
[272:36.26]That's fine.
[272:36.66]Okay, get that out of here.
[272:37.52]Like, seven buckets.
[272:45.35]I'm going so fast.
[272:46.57]I know.
[272:46.97]Am I?
[272:47.41]I can't.
[272:47.67]This is where I spill something.
[272:59.66]I just need like four or five, probably.
[273:01.62]That should be it.
[273:02.56]Then we can finish it.
[273:05.58]Play Feel Good Ink?
[273:13.35]No.
[273:14.01]That's a legit, full-on copyright song.
[273:18.53]I'm gonna go with six.
[273:20.21]That should be enough.
[273:28.44]Age of Mythology?
[273:29.24]I already did that.
[273:30.94]We already did Age of Empires, Age of Mythology.
[273:33.34]Didn't we do all that already?
[273:34.48]Alright, what else do I need?
[273:38.12]There's no... There's nothing else up there.
[273:39.88]I got all the meat.
[273:41.29]I just need to clean with the mop.
[273:49.23]Let's just get up there.
[274:19.53]See if I can do it with three.
[274:24.45]Just don't back the fuck up into these like an imbecile.
[274:28.97]Is that enough for me to walk by?
[274:30.66]How thick am I?
[274:32.98]Okay.
[274:36.44]Jesus.
[274:39.44]Oh my god, that's so hard to do.
[274:42.46]You do it twice and it's gone.
[274:47.85]Am I ever gonna be able to clean all this?
[274:49.13]I don't think I will.
[274:58.62]No!
[275:00.24]Oh no!
[275:12.62]Three sweeps and it's completely and totally filthy.
[275:20.66]Somebody in chat said, good luck cleaning that.
[275:24.39]Now I understand what the hell they talked about.
[275:29.81]So many layers.
[275:30.61]I have to get like six more buckets.
[275:40.17]Maybe not.
[275:41.25]Maybe I can do the rest with toilet water.
[275:56.40]Should've just bought a pizza cutter.
[275:58.82]Well, that's my own damn fault, isn't it?
[276:02.30]Well, that's... I got maybe five feet.
[276:07.74]Ay-yi-yi.
[276:11.77]Two trucks, Mr. Streamer.
[276:15.77]What is two trucks?
[276:22.83]Two trucks.
[276:23.15]Two trucks.
[276:31.52]Let me see what the hell you guys are talking about.
[276:32.86]Two trucks.
[276:41.35]What am I going to play this for?
[276:44.45]No, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[276:56.18]Why am I going to do that?
[276:58.14]Is it a good song?
[276:58.84]No, we don't play every single request.
[277:10.53]Um, what's a- what's a song I could put on right now?
[277:25.02]Look at this!
[277:26.16]Wow, there's like literally only are two options here apparently.
[277:32.38]One guy said this so it's going on.
[277:46.20]What the hell is this allowed for?
[277:53.44]Careful!
[278:04.13]Yeah, this is Luigi's Mansion.
[278:11.86]Official sounds.
[278:18.98]Get that.
[278:22.14]I might do it.
[278:23.02]It's possible this is going to be okay.
[278:26.11]Maybe.
[278:27.99]Because it's getting a lot thinner over here.
[278:39.32]I think we got it.
[278:39.84]That's the last bit I can do there.
[278:47.31]What are these random duck sounds?
[278:48.55]This is freaking me out because I feel like I'm walking with not the right sounds.
[279:11.39]When is the new one coming out?
[279:12.35]Aren't they making another one?
[279:20.76]Mario?
[279:21.32]No, Luigi's Mansion.
[279:22.52]Aren't they doing another one for Switch?
[279:24.98]I think we're gonna get it.
[279:32.46]This would be so satisfying if I can get it in just these last few buckets.
[279:37.96]Ah!
[279:40.46]I think I can do it.
[279:41.67]I think it's gonna happen.
[279:49.53]You stupid fucking game.
[279:56.28]I'm fine.
[279:57.02]What would have happened to it?
[279:57.92]No, not quite.
[280:01.26]Just give me the toilet.
[280:09.62]Excuse me.
[280:10.66]EXCUSE ME!
[280:31.62]Fuck!
[280:32.18]I'm dragging this around everywhere!
[280:34.00]I don't wanna hear Luigi anymore!
[280:41.71]That scared the shit out of me.
[280:43.09]I actually just, like, my face twitched when that happened.
[280:48.04]Is this an OST or is this somebody playing the fucking game?
[281:09.93]Why wasn't Professor E. Gadd in Smash Brothers?
[281:43.31]My toilet seat.
[281:45.07]I'm fucking breaking toilet seats and I have to bring fo- No, I'm not.
[281:47.77]I don't care.
[281:57.42]We're done.
[281:58.46]I did it.
[281:59.28]Done.
[282:00.52]It's been done.
[282:01.18]It's completed.
[282:01.74]We're fine.
[282:03.24]Just gotta get all this shit out of here.
[282:08.80]And then we're done.
[282:10.14]I can go downstairs.
[282:14.57]Throw the lantern into the toilet, fine.
[282:42.04]I hate to crack the egg.
[282:42.90]I wanted to see what was in it.
[282:55.18]I was never here, you're fine.
[283:01.26]Everything's clean, everything's good.
[283:02.36]Just gonna put this back on here.
[283:13.89]That's fine, fine, foo I don't think I'm getting it back Whatever
[283:49.01]I'm not gonna miss it.
[283:56.74]Upstairs is done.
[283:58.46]Let's go.
[284:00.00]Get out.
[284:01.60]All the junk.
[284:02.16]Just throw it in here.
[284:02.90]It'll be fine.
[284:07.86]That was fucking crazy.
[284:08.94]I just jumped.
[284:09.60]I tripped over this.
[284:10.82]That's what happened.
[284:11.56]I didn't jump.
[284:14.68]The gun.
[284:15.14]I need all this.
[284:19.51]Oh my fucking god, I was trying to pick it up, you idiot.
[284:24.82]Are these all empty anyways?
[284:49.85]Why?
[284:50.77]Why, God?
[285:04.94]No!
[285:07.14]Oh, I need the-
[285:30.61]Got them both?
[285:31.61]No.
[285:34.55]Why are you still here?
[285:39.47]Burn the buckets?
[285:40.23]No.
[285:40.47]That's going to cause a huge problem.
[285:44.21]I just cleaned it up.
[285:44.87]Alright, is there any more?
[285:59.28]Bullet holes?
[285:59.80]I don't see.
[286:01.54]I thought I just ran into something.
[286:09.18]You know, the thing is, there are probably a few people here that are like, I hate this.
[286:21.79]This song I'm talking about.
[286:23.75]They're all dirty.
[286:25.25]I can't flush either.
[286:29.16]And I'm fucking tracking this everywhere.
[286:30.53]Alright, we gotta... I can finish it up later.
[286:39.57]Look, I'm gonna come back up here later.
[286:43.29]We're gonna do our final pass through anyways.
[286:44.89]I don't see any bullet holes in here.
[286:51.08]Couple here.
[286:51.52]So that's one.
[286:55.88]Two.
[286:57.97]One.
[286:58.91]Two.
[287:01.07]One.
[287:02.03]Two.
[287:03.77]One.
[287:04.95]Two.
[287:09.64]Looks good.
[287:11.32]Make sure I didn't miss any... Lighten the room up so I can see.
[287:22.14]I think I'm good.
[287:32.44]I'll come up here and I'll finish this later.
[287:34.30]I gotta go down.
[287:38.00]Let's go.
[287:45.41]Let me take a look.
[287:46.27]Is there another one?
[287:47.29]Lower level.
[287:49.89]No, this is it.
[287:50.31]This is it.
[287:50.73]This is it.
[287:51.17]This is it.
[287:52.46]This is it.
[287:52.76]What the fuck was that?
[287:56.20]There's no basement.
[287:57.00]This is it.
[288:03.11]It's done.
[288:03.55]I just gotta throw the shit away, clean it up, do a final check.
[288:09.06]Fuck it, whatever.
[288:37.12]Okay.
[288:38.50]Let me just... I gotta... We're gonna do a final pass-through, clean up, bullet holes, make sure everything's done, everything's fine, and I'm gonna get the... It's gonna happen.
[288:50.65]Footprint... Don't worry, we're gonna get the final pass-through.
[288:53.23]We're gonna start over here.
[288:54.58]I don't know what that does.
[289:01.56]Alright, there's bullet holes here.
[289:05.60]Alright, I gotta- no, we gotta end here, cause that's the- that's the- okay, end there.
[289:10.89]We gotta end there!
[289:11.73]That's a final pass throughs!
[289:18.68]I gotta get all the way over here- I hate myself!
[289:33.92]You guys are in my head so much.
[289:36.02]All I can think about every time I pick up a bucket is, I'm gonna spill it.
[289:38.19]No, I'm not.
[289:38.63]Don't do that.
[289:39.17]People are gonna think it's on purpose.
[289:46.40]All right, start from here.
[289:59.05]Give me a couple buckets.
[290:00.21]We're going to clean this up.
[290:01.13]I'm going to get four new toilet covers.
[290:03.84]And then I can be at the end of the game.
[290:06.48]This level at least.
[290:07.18]And this game, what a great game.
[290:12.60]It's just so much fun.
[290:16.54]You just feel really accomplished.
[290:17.84]It just scratches a ton of itches.
[290:24.42]Make sure I'm not tracking anything.
[290:25.46]I'm not.
[290:25.82]Alright, I need some buckets.
[290:32.03]That's not a bucket.
[290:33.17]It's going immediately into- I can't even pick it up.
[290:35.25]That's fine.
[290:36.29]That's great.
[290:37.43]Don't.
[290:38.11]Don't.
[290:39.13]He's rushing.
[290:40.13]Slow him down.
[290:44.69]Okay.
[290:50.39]Yeah, get the arm.
[290:51.45]This is all bullshit.
[290:53.60]I didn't even do this.
[290:55.96]Again, that scared me.
[290:56.92]Again.
[290:57.12]I'm tur- I'm done with that one.
[291:11.86]GTA Vice City.
[291:20.86]My favorite part about this whole stream so far has been when the music turns off.
[291:27.79]I look over at the chatroom and it's just a million requests.
[291:33.95]That's the best part.
[291:41.12]The room is silent!
[291:42.06]Hurry up!
[291:43.02]Scream!
[291:43.74]We've done Earthbound.
[291:58.67]Too many requests here, I don't know what to do.
[292:02.44]I was supposed to do this a long time ago.
[292:23.09]Okay, where is my bucket?
[292:28.21]These are dirty.
[292:28.81]Whoops-a-daisy, didn't put them there.
[292:35.39]Alright, this is clean.
[292:37.47]Corner to corner, just last clean up.
[292:41.37]This is not, I need to get this arm out of here.
[292:47.77]This whole thing doesn't fit at all.
[292:51.43]This is bringing back such weird memories that I don't think I want to have right now.
[292:55.67]Just hanging out in Stormwind.
[292:58.56]You know, I don't want to... I don't really want to... That was... I don't want to think about that.
[293:01.64]Look at all this junk.
[293:13.61]This is just bringing back memories of idling and trade chat.
[293:17.43]Trying desperately...
[293:20.00]To sell.
[293:22.70]This one item that I was overpricing the fuck out of.
[293:25.62]Got like a BOE epic.
[293:28.56]And I probably sat there for like four days.
[293:30.70]Trying to get like 400 gold for it.
[293:32.99]And this song played in my sleep.
[293:34.69]Alright, let's burn it.
[293:47.52]Can I get it over there without spilling?
[293:49.63]Door needs to be open.
[293:50.47]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[293:57.23]Clean this up first.
[293:58.87]This is a fucking joke.
[294:02.99]That's a joke.
[294:09.70]Resident sleeper sour, please.
[294:11.92]How does that make any sense?
[294:24.45]That's funny.
[294:26.12]That's funny.
[294:26.78]Get us in there.
[294:40.61]It's looking good.
[294:42.87]Just easy.
[294:43.45]I'm gonna probably drop a piece of meat, but it's okay.
[294:59.03]Get in there.
[295:01.17]Thank God there's no dynamite in this level.
[295:08.01]The hell was that?
[295:10.11]Oh.
[295:11.75]It's the incinerator.
[295:14.29]Close that up!
[295:19.33]Uhhh, toilet seat!
[295:20.13]Go in the incinerator!
[295:26.98]A little piece of blood.
[295:27.74]It's almost at that point where I can pull out the blood detection unit.
[295:31.90]Get this shit on the walls.
[295:45.47]Looks pretty good to me.
[295:47.87]Look at that.
[295:48.31]It's beautiful.
[295:50.31]It's absolutely stunning.
[295:53.81]Absolutely stunning.
[296:00.11]Gotta go.
[296:04.42]Forgot about the basement.
[296:05.34]Where's the basement?
[296:08.54]There's some bullshit over here I have to take care of on.
[296:24.76]I don't see this magical basement level.
[296:28.82]That everybody seems to know where it is but me.
[296:36.90]Too dirty.
[296:38.89]Shit.
[296:40.05]Don't have any stray buckets just sitting around somewhere.
[296:45.03]It's behind the secret door.
[296:46.23]Last time everyone told me to do a secret door, it was dog shit.
[296:50.52]And it wasn't real.
[296:51.90]And I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get inside of it.
[296:54.20]So I don't know if I believe you right now.
[297:04.79]Alright.
[297:06.75]So far so good.
[297:09.51]One bucket.
[297:10.31]Any more blood or shit anywhere I can see?
[297:12.93]Not really.
[297:16.58]That doesn't count.
[297:17.10]It's on the other side.
[297:17.84]There's a note here.
[297:27.83]Today I saw something weird, they had me in again to repair another devils-blblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl
[297:56.69]I'm just trying to go too fast.
[298:00.51]He's pretending to spill.
[298:02.16]I blocked all of my vision.
[298:05.26]You fucking seriously don't go in there.
[298:06.76]Okay.
[298:23.24]One more spill and you have to play Death Grips.
[298:28.13]Well, that's not gonna happen, so I'm fine.
[298:55.69]Anybody see anything else?
[298:57.01]I don't.
[299:00.19]I think I'm almost ready.
[299:01.63]Except for this.
[299:09.44]Oh my god, just fucking throw it over there, I'll get it in a minute.
[299:28.76]There's a fucking incinerator.
[299:31.28]I'm so close to being done.
[299:35.92]Spill, spill, spill.
[299:37.32]What spill?
[299:49.57]The bucket.
[299:51.96]That one that's over here?
[299:52.60]On the ground over here?
[300:00.81]This wasn't... This was already spilled.
[300:03.00]That doesn't count.
[300:04.40]See, look.
[300:04.80]There's two of them here.
[300:17.82]Got it.
[300:18.18]Okay, good.
[300:21.12]Blood in the cage.
[300:22.66]Thank you!
[300:25.56]You guys are always looking out for me.
[300:26.55]Appreciate it.
[300:38.38]This is it.
[300:40.08]I just have to go upstairs.
[300:41.64]I'm going to take out the meter.
[300:45.12]And that's done.
[300:46.67]There's no secret level.
[300:47.59]I don't know what this is for, though.
[300:50.29]That has to be here for a reason, right?
[301:11.31]Have I stacked the crates and barrels?
[301:13.07]Uh, there was a door I had to go into earlier.
[301:16.05]Little crevice in the top corner that I had to go into, and I stacked a couple things.
[301:21.89]Okay.
[301:22.88]Ladies and gentlemen.
[301:25.22]I think that's it.
[301:26.64]Let's take, let's get, make sure one pass through the whole thing.
[301:31.38]Take out the meter.
[301:39.08]Well, ah!
[301:41.16]What's the problem over here?
[301:41.92]Is there an issue that I don't see?
[302:23.41]I need to get the, uh, gun.
[302:27.99]I need to get the gun, wherever I put it.
[302:38.60]Boomer laugh.
[302:43.30]I just made a little bit of noise with my mouth.
[302:45.55]Uh, you know, you know what?
[302:49.67]No one calls me a boomer, it's gone forever, okay?
[303:04.23]Hmm.
[303:05.55]Broken toilet.
[303:10.17]Just trying to keep my eye out.
[303:11.23]And then I'm gonna go through and do all the bullet holes.
[303:13.33]I gotta bring a bucket upstairs.
[303:16.63]That's pretty important.
[303:17.53]Give me a new bucket.
[303:18.21]Let's get that over here.
[303:25.93]Throw you away.
[303:26.79]And that should take us to the end.
[303:30.86]Just gotta go upstairs and fix a few things.
[303:32.68]I mean, that's spilled, but there's nothing in it, so.
[303:36.14]That doesn't count.
[303:36.66]I already went up there.
[303:45.83]No, that doesn't count.
[303:46.49]It has to be... Something has just spilled onto the ground.
[303:49.15]Nothing spilled on the ground.
[303:51.27]It was air.
[304:08.56]Alright, it's time to get the gun.
[304:13.04]Is it on here?
[304:13.60]Where is it?
[304:13.92]Upstairs?
[304:14.40]Is the gun upstairs?
[304:20.81]Blood on cage door.
[304:23.07]I'm doing my best.
[304:39.03]Ah, I still need one of those.
[304:39.91]Is this still the Stormwind music?
[304:51.03]Ow.
[304:51.99]What am I supposed to do with this?
[305:11.39]Oh, this is the Cataclysm version.
[305:12.77]Okay, I see.
[305:15.11]I feel you.
[305:17.97]I need that gun.
[305:20.41]I need the gun.
[305:21.01]I don't know where the hell I put it.
[305:22.05]Did I leave it upstairs?
[305:34.80]Well, alright, we're gonna go top to bottom then, because there's bullet holes down here.
[305:37.60]There's a health pack thing here.
[305:39.42]I mean, there's an explosion that just happened, right?
[305:41.98]Don't do that.
[305:42.54]It's already clean.
[305:43.12]Don't fucking do that.
[305:43.78]Okay.
[305:48.03]We're gonna go top to bottom.
[305:48.81]I need to bring one bucket up there.
[305:55.87]And, okay.
[305:59.28]Let's get it.
[306:02.46]Bullet holes.
[306:03.20]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[306:04.24]I'm gonna bring the gun down here.
[306:05.90]The gun is upstairs.
[306:06.96]The gun is upstairs right now.
[306:11.20]I got a fresh bucket to clean up the little residual shit on the ground.
[306:18.76]Ah, toilet seats.
[306:20.20]No, who cares?
[306:22.08]Just sit on the fucking raw seat.
[306:23.68]Doesn't matter.
[306:38.14]Looking good.
[306:39.56]That's it.
[306:41.00]That's what I needed to do.
[306:43.24]Bullet holes.
[306:46.00]Thinking of bullets.
[306:50.84]Rat's birthday mixtape.
[306:53.65]I'll do that at the very end.
[307:08.30]Good to go.
[307:08.60]There's blood in the other room.

[325:28.92]Okay, don't... I gotta be careful.
[325:30.22]I don't want to let this go because I don't want the blood.
[325:31.52]I don't see anything else.
[325:52.37]I'm not sure there's anything in there.
[325:58.05]Fuck, there is... Mop is dirty?

[327:58.65]Well, there's no... Let me try this one last time, because I don't know if I'm getting... Let me see what happens when I do this, because I feel like I can get in there.

[329:40.89]Oh, wait!
[329:58.72]Got it.
[330:07.15]There's more.
[330:32.84]How did this even get down here?
[330:33.92]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[330:50.01]It doesn't make any sense.
[330:55.95]Alright.

[336:26.61]Why?

[344:27.64]That's Santa's workshop.
[344:30.22]That's funny.
[344:30.74]99%.
[344:30.76]You left one shittier lid.
[344:38.98]Read the paper notes.
[344:41.12]Where are the paper notes?
[344:48.00]It was the toilet seats?
[344:48.83]This dirt man consumes blood.
[345:00.96]It's probably on paper.
[345:07.87]Keep a watchful eye on that station there.
[345:09.73]Look at the cat pictures.
[345:10.63]Nah!
[345:35.14]5% salary including, okay, cool.
[345:37.86]They're basically perfect.
[345:40.06]Yeah, no, I'll take a 99%.
[345:44.31]And that's it.
[345:47.61]And that's it.
[345:53.33]Read all the notes.
[345:58.29]One more level, one more.
[346:00.45]All right, fine, fine.
[346:01.47]All right, you know what?
[346:01.97]Fuck it, we're gonna do one more.
[346:03.39]We're gonna do one of the easy ones.
[346:09.85]What's the easy one?
[346:10.91]Is there one for the... Is there one that's like 10 minutes?
[346:15.39]Where's the one that's 5 minutes?
[346:16.61]Do the same level again?
[346:23.34]No, no, no.
[346:23.94]We're gonna do... How do I get out of here?
[346:44.40]Okay.
[346:44.64]What's a quick one?
[346:47.75]I want one that's one hour.
[346:50.27]One hour and thirty minutes, hour and thirty... Okay, this one.
[346:52.09]Frostbite.
[346:52.71]One hour.
[346:58.25]Unrefinery.
[346:59.05]One hour.
[347:04.16]Ooh, forty-five minutes.
[347:05.24]That's a quick one.
[347:05.88]Section eight.
[347:14.51]Alright, which one?
[347:16.23]Unrefinery?
[347:18.39]Or... Frostbite.
[347:24.90]Frostbite looks like it could be interesting.
[347:26.22]Yeah, let's do Frostbite.
[347:27.28]One hour.
[347:27.60]We got it.
[347:31.12]I'm going.
[347:34.66]Let's go.
[347:35.08]You didn't think I was gonna... Come on.
[347:38.37]This dreary research and storage facility has a long record of minor psychological incidents due to the isolation and cold, but even so, details regarding the events that decimated the facility are sketchy at best.
[347:49.52]An extraterrestrial organism is suspected to be involved.
[347:52.02]However, the junior recon team is certain that no poses no threat.
[347:55.68]There's nobody here.
[347:57.31]Already there are multiple conglomerates interested in acquiring the installation and collected data.
[348:01.03]Once you have executed your sanitation duties, work diligently and with speed as the facility is expected to be swept over via orbital biobomb to ensure security.
[348:09.55]Good day.
[348:11.25]All right.
[348:11.59]One hour.
[348:11.91]One hour.
[348:12.67]One hour.
[348:18.39]Not done any cleaning.
[348:19.21]Alright, where are we going?
[348:20.91]Nothing dirty over here.
[348:27.78]Easy.
[348:34.64]Where's the buckets?
[348:36.76]Buckets are over here.
[348:44.12]The outside is pretty clean.
[348:52.27]You mopping snow.
[348:55.92]Yeah, why would I need to do this?
[349:04.56]They would just melt into the ground.
[349:08.42]I'm going to try to get this one done in less than an hour.
[349:11.42]No fucking around.
[349:12.16]We're going to get this one done in like the next 40 minutes.
[349:17.49]Look, we don't got much.
[349:18.27]Where's the incinerator?
[349:25.37]Down here.
[349:32.05]No, no spill jokes.
[349:32.87]We'll get this done.
[349:33.99]Right fucking now.
[349:43.86]This is clean, clean.
[349:45.08]Whoa!
[349:47.36]Okay, well that's kind of fucked up.
[349:51.96]Start right here.
[349:53.74]Down in the corner.
[349:55.42]This is fucking huge.
[349:57.27]This map is huge.
[349:58.01]An hour?
[349:58.69]This is gonna take like six.
[350:01.09]No it isn't.
[350:01.61]No it isn't.
[350:02.23]Just deal with it.
[350:08.94]Look at all this shit.
[350:12.48]An hour.
[350:15.44]An hour!
[350:18.18]Is this dynamite down here?
[350:23.15]I need wa- okay, I gotta plan this out.
[350:24.91]I gotta block this out.
[350:25.62]Just wait.
[350:25.96]There's a- there's a bullet hole shit here.
[350:33.50]One hour, huh?
[350:40.98]So, incinerator here.
[350:42.22]We're gonna start... ...in the corner this way.
[350:47.30]I'm gonna- I'm gonna get some of these.
[350:50.14]The gun.
[350:52.35]We need two of these for right here.
[350:53.59]Give me that gun, we're gonna melt everything over here.
[351:09.08]Don't start a fire.
[351:11.20]These need chunks.
[351:18.06]We need another OST.
[351:27.75]Alright, this looks like it can be done now.
[351:31.55]Now there's one big chunk here that needs to go.
[351:37.20]I think that's good enough.
[351:45.38]You've got to go outside in.
[351:50.59]But if you're taking off, see you tomorrow.
[351:55.20]A lot of people are probably going to bed now.
[351:57.28]So, have a good night.
[351:58.96]I'll get this one finished.
[352:13.35]Fucking god.
[352:14.13]I'm trying to go to bed.
[352:15.23]One hour.
[352:16.05]Fuck.
[352:17.97]Oh.
[352:19.30]Oh, I was getting a little tired.
[352:20.58]I might have to, uh, I might have to just breathe another day.
[352:23.31]You know, it's a little sleepy at this point in the, uh, in the, you know, I'm getting a little sleepy.
[352:28.51]Oh, fuck.
[352:30.85]Where'd these go?
[352:31.27]I'm gonna put them over here.
[352:41.14]Okay, I need another one.
[352:43.20]Trying to get these all done right now.
[352:48.30]There's really not that much more.
[352:49.48]Did these explode?
[352:50.20]I don't even want to know.
[352:54.19]Put the fucking Etch-a-Sketch in there.
[352:55.59]I'm just gonna stick them all over there.
[353:11.10]How would you even do a speedrun with this?
[353:18.80]You need to be on the ball.
[353:25.02]The gun does not affect the barrels?
[353:26.70]That's good to know.
[353:27.44]Alright, Incinerator is... where is it?
[353:29.09]Down that way?
[353:29.65]Let's just do it now.
[353:37.41]Goodbye.
[353:40.63]This is definitely the dirtiest place.
[353:44.24]But, without a doubt.
[353:46.48]Okay, well I don't know what just happened.
[353:49.17]Something bad happened there.
[353:50.05]It's alright.
[353:55.17]I need some water.
[353:55.97]A couple more boxes.
[353:57.89]I can make them level 2 messy?
[354:07.01]That's possible.
[354:09.85]Put on the thing, OST.
[354:11.43]No.
[354:17.75]Peter.
[354:19.05]God damn it.
[354:20.69]Whatever.
[354:29.37]Get a couple of buckets.
[354:30.89]You can get out of the way.
[354:31.83]I'm going to move these because that'll look nicer if it's just over here.
[354:46.31]Just get this shit out of the way.
[354:47.41]We're not going for, like, sexy with this one, you know what I mean?
[354:53.41]We're going for clean.
[354:57.10]Then that'd be, like, perfect.
[355:11.61]It's fine.
[355:12.11]Alright, not doing so bad.
[355:17.96]I need to... Where's the thing that generates the... What the hell is it?
[355:23.14]There it is.
[355:28.86]It was sexier before.
[355:30.52]That's alright.
[355:34.92]I've... I've put it down, too.
[355:43.41]Just don't rush.
[355:44.33]Just give me a couple of them.
[355:50.03]Three should do it.
[355:50.73]Oh god.
[356:05.74]Just like a puzzle.
[356:06.64]Pick it up.
[356:08.48]Get it over there.
[356:10.16]Walk.
[356:14.07]When does the game start?
[356:15.85]Right now?
[356:19.78]Is that, I don't know.
[356:22.16]It is, but it's okay.
[356:27.36]Easy, that's gonna fuck.
[356:29.78]We're good.
[356:38.15]All right, quickly, let's go.
[356:40.21]Let's go, let's go, I'm angry.
[356:41.87]I'm really not though.
[356:44.71]This dumb motherfucker, what are you thinking?
[357:02.24]Getting there.
[357:09.27]I'm trying to go too fast.
[357:12.45]That one hour estimate, man.
[357:15.25]Who is playing that?
[357:29.25]What do we got right now?
[357:36.96]It's been like, it's been like 20 minutes already.
[357:39.82]How do you physically do this in one hour?
[357:42.52]Especially by yourself.
[357:48.50]That just burnt me and turned it upside down.
[357:57.71]30 minutes left.
[357:58.39]It actually, I might surprise myself and get it done pretty quick.
[358:02.79]This was the big holy shit moment here.
[358:04.31]This was the worst one.
[358:07.76]There's like 30 or 40 pieces of person here.
[358:23.29]Okay.
[358:23.65]There we go.
[358:33.87]Couple more pieces.
[358:34.69]I'm going to lose some of these.
[358:36.99]If I can get an 80% here, I'll be happy.
[358:40.17]That's all I'm looking for.
[358:43.92]I'm not looking for 100%.
[358:44.58]I'm looking for 80%.
[358:45.12]Halo.
[358:45.22]Halo.
[359:06.17]Pull it up.
[359:07.19]Nice.
[359:09.65]Close.
[359:11.30]Put this in the burner.
[359:23.71]There's really not much out here.
[359:25.51]So... That blended in with the fucking fauna.
[359:47.91]I might be getting too tired for this shit.
[360:00.05]I think I've lost it.
[360:04.29]I just laughed.
[360:05.55]Like I was at a comedy club and I was like 60.
[360:07.73]That was like a 60 year old fat guy at a comedy club.
[360:13.13]In the back laughing his ass off.
[360:24.92]Why does he have to be fat?
[360:27.18]I don't know.
[360:27.76]Because he just apparently does.
[360:34.61]I have to come back and fix that later.
[360:35.99]That's just...
[360:44.63]Okay.
[360:45.19]This place is done.
[360:47.29]Done, done, done.
[360:49.73]Let's take a look around.
[360:50.59]Get some blood this way.
[360:54.05]And there's an earthworm over here.
[360:55.37]We gotta get rid of it.
[360:56.01]Looking good.
[360:57.65]Nice.
[361:03.46]Pick you up.
[361:04.74]Come with me.
[361:05.22]I need water again.
[361:21.08]I don't think there's very much outside.
[361:22.33]There's these two little research facilities.
[361:26.79]And... Out here.
[361:30.11]That's it.
[361:35.62]Meltdown?
[361:36.10]What?
[361:38.82]Where's the Meltdown?
[361:41.26]I'm fine.
[361:46.50]Meltdown...
[361:50.36]I don't agree with you at all.
[361:53.66]Alright, there's the other one.
[361:54.64]Make sure I get everything outside.
[361:59.13]Some footprints.
[361:59.69]There's going to be a dead body back here probably.
[362:01.39]Yes, there is.
[362:02.09]And a note.
[362:02.65]Let's read it.
[362:05.10]I think I'm the last one left.
[362:06.18]They killed each other one by one, or it killed them.
[362:09.22]I don't know.
[362:09.94]This thing, whatever it is, we unleashed it and now we're paying the price.
[362:14.10]I can't get to the mess hall and I haven't had a drink in three days.
[362:16.76]I don't feel so hot.
[362:18.92]Ha, did I just make a joke?
[362:20.88]God damn it.
[362:22.58]Sorry.
[362:31.47]The thing OST.
[362:42.61]I'm not going to acknowledge what happened.
[362:54.43]I need two more.
[363:01.64]Why is our office chair out here?
[363:02.94]What the fuck is this doing out here?
[363:08.52]Alright.
[363:08.88]We're on good time.
[363:21.66]20 minutes left.
[363:24.35]But seriously though, we got over here.
[363:28.49]This little corner, the two research facilities.
[363:31.45]And that's it.
[363:34.37]Snack box.
[363:36.81]Person, person...
[363:39.32]Yeah, I'll get this done in like 30 minutes.
[363:40.86]You bet your ass I will.
[363:52.80]Carpenter makes good music?
[363:55.67]Oh, yeah.
[363:56.93]The Thing's a great movie.
[363:57.57]It's a really good movie, actually.
[364:01.47]It's one of the best.
[364:05.43]One of the best thriller, horror-type movies you could probably watch.
[364:20.04]Nothing this way, right?
[364:22.47]Just checking to make sure I don't get... I gotta get at least 80%.
[364:25.05]This one's done.
[364:34.11]With that guy walked over here, I'm gonna need to clean that up a little bit.
[364:38.88]There's probably blood and shit up there.
[364:39.86]There's probably a dead body up there, too.
[364:43.54]It's alright.
[364:44.02]It's all good.
[364:45.56]Uh, buckets.
[364:46.18]I need six.
[364:49.80]Want anything in there?
[364:50.90]Is this empty?
[364:51.56]It is.
[364:52.46]Get this down here.
[364:53.23]I need six buckets.
[365:05.26]It's gonna be easier on me if I just do this one by one.
[365:15.47]Gotta finish cleaning where that guy was.
[365:17.29]Yeah, that's alright.
[365:18.73]I will.
[365:19.09]I won't forget it.
[365:19.62]Alright.
[365:22.84]I need... Fuck.
[365:23.96]I need that gun, probably.
[365:36.65]This is actually not as bad as I thought it was.
[365:41.75]It really isn't.
[365:47.20]Bring this down here.
[365:48.10]I mean, there's a shitload of people.
[365:52.94]Random body parts, but it's alright.
[366:03.04]Bob the Builder OST.
[366:06.60]There is no OST.
[366:07.46]Bob the Builder doesn't have an OST.
[366:20.15]Good thing I have another one of these down here.
[366:21.31]I'm not going to bring the dynamite, because that would be bad.
[366:25.03]I'd explode myself.
[366:37.78]Just tipping.
[366:39.94]I'm going to lose a piece, probably, but whatever.
[366:41.78]Let's bring it up.
[366:48.64]Please do it?
[366:50.52]What do you want?
[366:51.12]Do what?
[366:53.84]Bob the Builder?
[367:05.85]Nothing spilled, good.
[367:23.10]one hour yeah maybe if you have maybe play with four people I don't understand what's going on right now because I can't look them up you know you know what let's go just take them we're still waiting for that apology I didn't do anything
[367:53.15]I'm not even going to look.
[367:59.91]Alright.
[368:01.61]Now I can start the cleanup process down here.
[368:03.45]It's because I didn't play Death Grips.
[368:07.87]I'm sorry.
[368:09.97]I'm sorry, guys.
[368:16.04]Put my own music in the background?
[368:21.46]I'm really thinking Bob the Builder.
[368:23.78]OST?
[368:24.02]Something like that?
[368:30.26]Okay, I need a bunch of these.
[368:38.05]This is not enough.
[368:39.47]This is not a level surface.
[368:40.83]This is not going to work.
[368:41.49]I need to pick this up.
[368:42.67]Put it on a level surface.
[368:45.55]Like right here.
[368:46.25]I need four.
[368:49.68]I'll try to pick up four.
[368:50.86]I can't do any more than that.
[368:54.30]Any more than that is a disaster waiting to happen.
[368:56.11]Look at how fucked up this is.
[368:59.67]This is all fucked up.
[369:00.97]Beautiful.
[369:05.61]Alright, one more.
[369:10.26]Did that spill?
[369:13.34]I don't think so, right?
[369:17.08]No.
[369:23.37]Straight ahead.
[369:25.55]No, not straight ahead.
[369:26.57]This way.
[369:40.41]Thank God, it's just barely tall enough to fit under here.
[369:51.36]Beautiful.
[369:52.56]Set it down.
[369:54.10]Nice and easy.
[369:57.17]Okay.
[369:57.93]Nice.
[369:59.60]Oops.
[370:00.98]Oops.
[370:02.60]I don't know what to do.
[370:04.16]I don't know what to do.
[370:04.83]Okay, I'm fine.
[370:20.73]You can't tell me that that was my fault.
[370:22.08]That was so fucked up.
[370:23.20]That was just... The water was alive at that point.
[370:26.42]What the hell was that?
[370:27.26]I didn't... I did not... That was... You know how much bullshit that was.
[370:35.62]I'm trying to take the top one out and the whole thing just starts to come alive.
[370:42.40]I was being so careful.
[370:43.38]You can't tell me I wasn't being careful there.
[370:45.06]I was being so careful.
[370:50.85]Stop stacking four.
[370:52.29]Fuck!
[370:53.25]No, I can't!
[370:55.95]This is gonna take me like three hours.
[371:02.29]Where are they?
[371:04.59]They have to take me across the whole game.
[371:06.41]I did that on purpose because I was fucking angry.
[371:27.14]I may as well just kicked that bucket as hard as I could.
[371:47.35]Let's go with two.
[371:54.77]Now there's blood everywhere.
[372:01.64]What are you doing?
[372:02.32]What are you doing?
[372:03.22]You're like falling.
[372:04.20]It's jumping out right now.
[372:05.50]Why are you falling out?
[372:06.86]Stay right there.
[372:07.44]Ay carumba, my god.
[372:14.45]Okay, can we please start cleaning up?
[372:34.28]I'm gonna knock this fucking thing over, I swear to god.
[372:36.26]Alright, I'm gonna put this guy in the bathtub.
[372:41.80]Just go in the bathtub for now, I'll deal with you later.
[372:44.06]Oh my god!
[372:45.52]Get in there!
[372:46.44]I'm ruining this whole thing!
[372:49.27]Oh my god!
[372:51.79]Just take him!
[372:52.63]Just fucking take the goddamn guy and put him in the fire!
[373:02.32]I shouldn't have even moved him!
[373:09.35]The place is filthy.
[373:22.88]He'll be fine.
[373:35.32]35 minutes left?
[373:35.83]I think I'll get it.
[373:41.80]There's really only the other place after this.
[373:44.14]And that's it.
[373:49.31]I wish I could put the camera down.
[373:51.27]Because, like, you can't even see.
[373:53.51]Like, I can't aim this down because... What the hell?
[373:55.99]I want us to look down!
[373:57.83]But if I look down, I have to put the fucking tube down!
[374:22.38]Here comes a meltdown.
[374:24.66]No, there's no meltdown.
[374:26.12]You can't meltdown in this game.
[374:32.87]It's almost done.
[374:34.79]There's just dynamite.
[374:39.37]A couple of bathtubs need cleaning.
[374:42.82]Okay, this looks much better.
[374:50.41]I need to step on something for this.
[374:52.17]Can I stand on this?
[375:06.54]Apparently I can.
[375:13.96]What is this?
[375:15.88]Three life forms in the ice?
[375:20.49]Specimens have been thawed.
[375:21.79]So these are aliens in here.
[375:22.67]Okay.
[375:33.00]Now this is going to be impossible.
[375:34.50]I need to bring this over here and I need to close... Don't knock that over.
[375:39.50]Okay.
[375:41.42]Can I fit it all in here?
[375:42.32]Let's find out.
[375:52.89]I think I can.
[375:59.55]No.
[376:01.37]I can walk this one back.
[376:02.51]So let's see if I can get the little pieces in there.
[376:08.43]Do I have another one down here?
[376:09.97]No, not right now.
[376:13.38]This, on the other hand, I'm just going to walk it back.
[376:18.66]Because it's too big.
[376:24.51]There's no way.
[376:26.19]Yeah, I'm going to have to come back.
[376:27.45]Am I shit-faced?
[376:32.95]What's going on here?
[376:33.59]Am I drunk?
[376:34.47]Where'd that go?
[376:38.90]Okay, well.
[376:40.52]I'm going to walk this back.
[376:41.80]There's the 99%.
[376:48.64]Watch out for... Okay.
[376:49.18]Okay.
[376:53.99]There are no buckets in the way.
[376:59.09]Speaking of buckets.
[377:02.25]What happened here?
[377:09.21]I'm gonna need like two or three more.
[377:15.70]Stack up two.
[377:21.30]Here comes the bad ending.
[377:27.70]I think I can do three.
[377:29.80]Four is pushing it, but three is possible.
[377:32.72]This might not be the best place to do this.
[377:34.12]I need to move it a little bit so it's on the flatter ground.
[377:40.16]Okay.
[377:43.64]Five?
[377:44.22]No way I can do five.
[377:47.49]If four is pushing it, five is dumb.
[377:54.59]I'm walking.
[377:55.87]Nice and slow.
[378:10.97]What?
[378:11.93]Which one does... I don't think that was anything.
[378:22.44]That was not.
[378:23.06]None of these spilled.
[378:31.12]Oh my god, it's doing it again.
[378:33.10]Fuck!
[378:44.25]It's gonna do it again.
[378:52.53]I'm not touching anything.
[378:56.35]How did this happen?
[379:01.72]It's stuck inside.
[379:03.32]The second one is stuck inside.
[379:04.82]It's wedged in there somehow.
[379:16.89]I'm trying to turn it.
[379:23.03]Please, don't let me salvage.
[379:24.25]Is that gonna fall?
[379:25.19]Let me salvage this one.
[379:27.59]Thank god.
[379:30.59]That's not a good spot for that.
[379:38.12]Okay.
[379:39.74]I didn't do anything.
[379:40.64]It just shot me up here.
[379:43.14]What the hell?
[379:43.98]Why am I up here?
[379:47.32]What am I doing up here?
[379:48.48]Why am I up here?
[379:49.48]Okay.
[380:01.59]No more blood.
[380:02.37]Blood's in the front door.
[380:13.91]You're doing this on your own.
[380:15.61]Yeah, I know.
[380:16.29]And that's part of the estimate.
[380:18.70]One hour.
[380:22.56]Uh-uh.
[380:35.59]Where... I don't think I have...
[380:39.77]No, I got one.
[380:40.31]I think it's full though, isn't it?
[380:42.15]Speaking of full, I gotta get this shit out of here.
[380:44.55]This one's full.
[380:47.01]This is just a hazard waiting to happen.
[380:50.63]This is a piece I need to take with me.
[380:53.82]Look at all these buckets that are just asking for me to tip over.
[380:58.48]Is that in?
[380:59.10]Kind of.
[380:59.50]I gotta get this out.
[381:00.08]I need another one.
[381:02.26]I gotta bring this back or get another one.
[381:06.28]That's very loud for what's in here.
[381:19.76]What did I bump into?
[381:25.48]Those parts are alive?
[381:26.72]I hope not.
[381:29.44]Alright.
[381:38.83]So close to being almost ready to play.
[381:43.77]What am I... I am playing.
[381:44.63]What am I talking about?
[381:48.66]This is really, really dirty.
[381:49.76]I've got to mop all this up.
[381:50.76]I've got plenty of buckets for that, though.
[381:52.10]Just make sure I get all these little bits and pieces down here.
[381:56.38]There are a couple more alien hands.
[382:03.02]Okay, can I reach?
[382:15.92]How's that one reaching?
[382:19.09]Hey, there we go.
[382:22.03]Give me this.
[382:26.88]Ah, put that down.
[382:34.56]Forget about the... I don't care about the dynamite and shit.
[382:37.72]What the hell is this?
[382:40.43]Med kits?
[382:41.29]Somebody else can come and figure that out.
[382:52.74]clean clean kind of this has got to go bucket bucket bucket bucket buckets everywhere mmm piece of meat it's a leg two over here
[383:21.40]Remember when he promised us Death Grips?
[383:24.60]Did I promise Death Grips, though, or did I say... Wouldn't that be fun?
[383:29.97]If he saw Death Grips.
[383:30.91]I don't think I promised it.
[383:32.39]Alright, that's good.
[383:39.83]Any more limbs?
[383:41.01]There's one over here.
[383:44.89]Pretty good.
[383:45.73]Alright.
[383:46.85]This place is almost done.
[383:47.89]Need to stack up some of these.
[383:52.47]That one needs to be stacked.
[383:55.49]And we can get the hell out of here and go to the last part.
[384:00.44]This is dirty.
[384:03.40]Look at how many buckets are down here.
[384:05.34]You've got to be kidding me.
[384:07.46]There's at least 10 to 12 buckets down here.
[384:17.35]Is that what I get to see?
[384:18.59]4k?
[384:18.67]What do you mean?
[384:24.69]I don't think I'm getting this one.
[384:40.34]Well, that sucks.
[384:42.94]Well, it's technically clean.
[384:44.18]It's not there anymore.
[384:45.10]Alright.
[384:49.26]Little doodads.
[384:49.98]Put them in here.
[384:51.82]Get this.
[384:53.38]Can this fit in here too?
[384:56.67]Maybe?
[384:56.89]Yeah, with a little jiggling it should be alright.
[385:04.84]No blood in there.
[385:07.36]Clean.
[385:07.74]No blood in there.
[385:08.54]Clean, clean, clean.
[385:09.74]Just the stairs.
[385:10.62]I'm gonna go do that now.
[385:11.48]In fact, let's bring this fucking up with us.
[385:21.27]Because, you know, it's not gonna fucking get any better.
[385:27.02]There are pieces up here.
[385:27.92]I might as well pick this up.
[385:34.08]Bring this too.
[385:34.83]This is full though, so I'm not sure how well this is gonna go.
[385:42.71]Can I fit these little pieces in there?
[385:48.17]No.
[385:49.15]I'm just gonna have to clean.
[385:53.17]Just gonna have to go like this on the walls, and slowly go up here, and then be done.
[385:56.73]And there's only one more little spot left, and that's it.
[385:59.81]I beat it.
[386:11.04]That's done.
[386:13.80]Where's a clean bucket?
[386:15.82]Clean bucket.
[386:16.46]I need one.
[386:16.82]There's one right here, right?
[386:18.68]Yes!
[386:20.72]Jeremy, I'm so proud of you.
[386:21.76]Hey, thanks.
[386:25.54]Thanks.
[386:26.94]Really?
[386:29.50]Are you really?
[386:31.47]Thank you.
[386:34.95]That means a shitload.
[386:36.03]I almost have the bloody hell achievement.
[386:40.71]10,000?
[386:43.05]I'm not sure.
[386:43.68]10,000 what?
[386:43.84]Blood mops?
[386:54.68]Actually, let's get this out of here.
[386:55.98]I'll fucking trip over this.
[386:56.90]There's still bits of people all over the stairs.
[387:02.14]Yeah, but this is the big one.
[387:03.24]There's one other facility over there and then that's it.
[387:08.14]We got community subs.
[387:08.93]Great Canadian fuck club.
[387:10.17]Thank you for your five gifted subs.
[387:13.91]Thank you.
[387:17.79]Adding to the absolute ridiculous amount that you've gifted.
[387:22.01]Hundreds.
[387:25.23]Hundreds of gifted subs.
[387:26.79]Hundreds of them.
[387:33.91]Dirty.
[387:34.43]Dirty.
[387:34.91]Alright, can he do it?
[387:38.88]Is he capable of doing something like this?
[387:41.96]To save a little time?
[388:07.06]Yeah, I'm fucking glad it happened.
[388:22.11]How many buckets?
[388:22.95]So many of them!
[388:25.25]More community subs!
[388:26.37]Kazzy just came in with ten community subs.
[388:28.21]Thank you, Kazzy.
[388:32.65]Ten!
[388:35.63]More community subs!
[388:38.38]Yeah, you can't spill when there's nothing in them.
[388:43.72]I can get it.
[388:45.10]It's hard to see.
[388:47.24]Thank you guys so much, seriously.
[388:52.82]Tons of subs have come from community subs recently, so... Okay, I... Saved it.
[389:03.01]Saved it.
[389:06.59]It's too heavy.
[389:08.73]I can't pick it up, it's too heavy.
[389:25.50]It's too heavy, I can't do it.
[389:28.78]Wait, maybe I can.
[389:30.37]No, just take the top.
[389:31.99]Take the top three.
[389:33.85]Go, out.
[389:37.99]The thing would just tip over.
[389:39.13]It's too heavy.
[389:52.54]Spill joke?
[389:53.26]No, that's an intentional pick-it-up joke.
[389:56.02]That wasn't even a joke.
[389:56.90]Why am I calling it a joke?
[390:05.75]This has liquid in it.
[390:06.93]Just don't be a dumb idiot and just put it in there and get it in and then pick it up.
[390:10.81]Dispose of it.
[390:16.06]Put on the English lessons.
[390:26.46]What is this game about?
[390:28.61]It is a game where the goal is you just clean up a battlefield.
[390:37.92]You get a mop.
[390:38.60]You get buckets.
[390:40.26]You have to pick everything up.
[390:41.20]You gotta mop everything.
[390:42.32]And that's pretty much all of it.
[390:43.68]That's the whole game.
[390:47.10]Make sure I'm not... I'm tracking this, but it's okay.
[390:51.40]Alright.
[390:53.96]So close.
[390:55.30]Just need to bring another one or two buckets down here.
[391:03.86]Alright, somebody get me a good English lesson.
[391:05.78]I'll put it on.
[391:10.41]Just barely wedged that in.
[391:15.21]Can you do a Fortnite dance after the stream?
[391:17.15]Yeah, sure.
[391:28.62]Okay, I can't.
[391:29.16]I gotta pick these up.
[391:33.94]Let's go with one, two... I'm gonna say three will be alright.
[391:42.87]Oy yi yi.
[391:47.13]Oy.
[391:47.53]Just fix it.
[392:00.24]Flat surface, that's the problem.
[392:01.58]Okay.
[392:18.72]Got it.
[392:20.88]Slowly.
[392:21.88]Don't be stupid.
[392:25.66]What's the best Fortnite dance?
[392:33.14]I don't know.
[392:35.92]Oh boy, don't do that.
[392:37.24]Pick it up.
[392:37.86]Don't!
[392:38.24]Please don't!
[392:57.75]I can't put it here.
[393:02.21]Lift it up.
[393:02.98]Lift it up.
[393:03.58]Pull it back.
[393:06.34]Right here.
[393:07.36]I'm good.
[393:08.82]Relax.
[393:17.39]I was just like tied up somewhere.
[393:21.57]I don't know anything, please!
[393:38.88]Alright, we can move on from this area in just a moment.
[393:48.95]Time for the looping Dr. Phil joke.
[393:52.67]No, it's late.
[393:53.91]It's getting late for that.
[393:57.29]That was like a four hours ago type deal.
[394:02.55]People are getting tired.
[394:18.00]That was a lot of blood there, and now it's almost gone.
[394:28.23]Looking good.
[394:30.31]Alright.
[394:31.67]Couple more footprints.
[394:34.17]There's some body parts down here still, though, unfortunately.
[394:36.97]Everything else looks pretty good.
[394:44.96]He's doing another level?
[394:45.86]Yeah, this is just a quick one, though.
[394:47.45]Well, it's supposed to be.
[394:52.41]It is going to be quick.
[394:54.58]Because we're pretty much almost at the last spot.
[395:01.27]I do need one of these.
[395:11.35]There were some body parts down here still that I want to make sure I got.
[395:14.31]Like this one here.
[395:16.77]And then we're gonna crush it with the nuclear waste.
[395:21.64]Mop up the last bits.
[395:23.70]And leave.
[395:24.24]And leave.
[395:29.32]Stop stalling!
[395:31.76]I'm going as fast as I goddamn can!
[395:35.14]Stalling!
[395:37.30]I'm trying as hard as I can to do this in like less than an hour and a half.
[395:45.57]Faster!
[395:46.23]I'm go- I'm trying!
[395:47.41]That's it.
[395:56.29]Pretty good.
[395:58.20]Ceiling, walls, everything looks clean.
[395:59.84]Gonna get this out of here.
[396:00.78]Burn it.
[396:02.50]Alright.
[396:02.88]Wait, this is dirty too.
[396:04.22]Somebody said that's dirty.
[396:05.20]Doesn't matter.
[396:05.64]They can be dirty.
[396:09.62]Okay.
[396:11.68]Let's go!
[396:16.37]Watch out for the buckets.
[396:17.33]There's two buckets right in front of me.
[396:19.13]Don't ram into them.
[396:20.27]Where are they?
[396:20.69]Right there.
[396:22.69]Okay.
[396:23.77]Drain this.
[396:26.89]What do I got?
[396:27.29]20 minutes?
[396:28.37]12 minutes left?
[396:32.01]It's going to be close.
[396:33.07]It will be.
[396:37.28]Because that's the only thing left.
[396:42.54]Hold on.
[396:52.03]I'm gonna bring this one with me.
[396:53.86]Because there's still some shit on the outside.
[396:56.82]Let's finish up the outside.
[397:02.22]I gotta pee, but I can't go to the bathroom right now.
[397:13.64]I got 11 minutes left.
[397:14.68]I can't go pee right now.
[397:21.00]That looks good.
[397:23.14]Some blood in the corner over there.
[397:24.88]I'll get it.
[397:29.79]Hopefully I'm going to be able to do it with this.
[397:31.53]Because it's a huge spill.
[397:35.67]Got it.
[397:35.97]Nice.
[397:36.27]Okay, good.
[397:37.25]Great.
[397:44.54]Almost there.
[397:45.20]Close.
[397:45.50]I just got to get on top.
[397:47.00]Okay, I see a body right there.
[397:58.10]God damn it, there's so much up here.
[398:00.26]Only out that, right?
[398:01.16]Yep, only right here.
[398:04.28]Shit.
[398:05.08]Um... I'm gonna have to do this.
[398:07.10]I'll have to clean it up later.
[398:11.95]I just gotta get it off.
[398:14.37]I know I'm causing a mess, but it's better than nothing.
[398:27.34]Got it.
[398:29.40]Damn it.
[398:30.26]Don't.
[398:30.60]I got it.
[398:30.94]Don't move.
[398:32.22]I'm making footprints.
[398:34.04]I got it.
[398:34.42]It's clean here.
[398:35.04]I'm going to jump off backwards.
[398:37.78]That's the only way this is going to work.
[398:42.32]Okay.
[398:42.76]We're good.
[398:58.63]Okay.
[399:01.07]This is gonna... It's a disaster over here.
[399:05.24]It's an absolute disaster.
[399:07.94]It's okay.
[399:09.04]That's the last thing I'm gonna do.
[399:11.00]Give me some buckets.
[399:11.68]We're gonna go down here.
[399:15.47]I need... What do I need?
[399:16.63]I need an incinerator.
[399:20.21]Right?
[399:20.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[399:24.21]I think... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[399:29.47]Give me... I'm going to say five?
[399:31.47]Four?
[399:32.07]We'll do three.
[399:34.35]There's plenty of dog shit over here anyway.
[399:35.97]It doesn't matter.
[399:48.68]That means I got four over there.
[399:49.90]I don't know how dirty it is down there, but I'm sure I'm about to find out.
[399:56.24]Pretty good.
[399:56.84]First try.
[399:57.64]Stack it.
[399:58.42]Walk.
[400:08.97]Alright, work, down.
[400:17.32]No, bring it down.
[400:19.88]Bring it down to like this spot here.
[400:21.28]Bring it all the way.
[400:21.88]What's down?
[400:22.20]What the hell is even down here?
[400:23.04]Alright, not bad, not bad.
[400:24.62]It's almost done.
[400:25.24]We got it.
[400:25.56]There's really not that much blood down here.
[400:27.86]Let's see what I can get with one bucket.
[400:35.64]This is actually fairly clean already.
[400:53.69]I need one of those.
[400:54.27]Hold on.
[401:00.83]I need a box!
[401:04.01]30 seconds?
[401:04.41]Well, I'm not gonna get it in the hour, but I'll get it in the... in... within the next 20 minutes.
[401:12.59]I need a box.
[401:13.09]I need two boxes.
[401:18.25]Stack these.
[401:18.86]I don't need them anymore.
[401:21.86]Doesn't matter if they spill.
[401:22.66]I don't care.
[401:31.34]One for this way.
[401:33.03]I'm just gonna do it now.
[401:33.83]Get it out of the way.
[401:37.23]Fill this up.
[401:47.56]This torso is so big.
[402:01.73]You're gonna have to call it a night?
[402:02.77]Well, good night.
[402:03.71]Have a good night.
[402:05.41]I know we're going kind of long into the evening here.
[402:08.28]But I had to do another one.
[402:10.00]I'm addicted to this game.
[402:13.64]This game really is just too much fun just to do this.
[402:15.90]It just is.
[402:16.28]I don't know why.
[402:21.92]Something's gonna get lost over here.
[402:26.44]What's happening next year?
[402:27.14]Oh, by the way, so tomorrow... Tomorrow we're gonna play Simpsons Hit and Run.
[402:32.38]Either it's gonna be on the PS2 or PC, whatever version I can get to work.
[402:37.58]This is not gonna work.
[402:38.52]Yeah, speaking of working... Yeah, that is the plan for tomorrow.
[402:50.71]Need a bucket.
[402:56.37]And depending on how long we do that... I don't know, maybe I'll like it and I'll play the whole thing.
[403:00.90]How long is the game?
[403:05.22]Six hours or something?
[403:06.14]How long is it?
[403:09.92]Fifty hours?
[403:10.88]No, it's not.
[403:13.58]It's a fifty hour game?
[403:14.86]How?
[403:20.01]How is that even possible?
[403:25.23]There's a PlayStation 2 game.
[403:30.91]I gotta dump this.
[403:39.35]There's so many body parts over here.
[403:41.69]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[404:00.93]Alright, that's it.
[404:02.17]I need... There's so many body parts over here still.
[404:05.89]Fuuuuhhhh!
[404:11.60]I'm putting it in the bucket, I don't care.
[404:13.31]Oh my god.
[404:32.43]Why?
[404:43.00]Where is it?
[404:43.46]Can I reach from here?
[404:46.63]What do you think?
[404:49.29]No.
[404:50.73]Not even close.
[405:03.55]Clean, right?
[405:05.05]Just this little intestine, put it in here.
[405:11.53]And I'm ready to move on.
[405:13.45]In fact, I'm almost ready to clock it out.
[405:16.72]Not much longer.
[405:24.26]And yes, I almost just ran right into that bucket.
[405:26.26]That would have been terrible.
[405:34.26]Good.
[405:37.28]These have water, clean water.
[405:40.89]Just gotta get a bucket down there.
[405:42.03]And then I'm clocking out.
[405:45.83]I'll have it all.
[405:50.57]It doesn't look too bad.
[405:56.33]Just need one of the big, uh, incinerator buckets.
[406:03.19]Nothing else, alright, nothing else, nothing else.
[406:05.37]No, I'm good.
[406:11.16]It's time to go.
[406:11.84]Uh, yeah.
[406:27.43]So, after this, after doing this as fast as I can, pretty much, I wonder what, I wonder if I'm gonna have, like, 80%.
[406:32.76]What do you think?
[406:33.30]75?
[406:33.32]80?
[406:35.26]I'm gonna say 85%.
[406:38.15]I have to do it down here.
[406:39.91]And then throwing all the buckets away, too.
[406:43.72]Speaking of buckets, let's get this down here.
[406:45.16]Because I need to fill this.
[406:50.66]With all the junk that's down here.
[406:52.00]Alright, I got a bucket down here.
[407:00.11]Okay.
[407:05.43]I just set you down.
[407:06.93]Why are you broken?
[407:15.18]Chunks.
[407:15.66]Get him in.
[407:24.01]Let's take a look quickly.
[407:25.49]More chunks.
[407:27.45]More chunks.
[407:36.82]That's a big chunk.
[407:39.63]I'm gonna take that by itself.
[407:44.77]There's an alien in the room.
[407:46.67]That's fine.
[407:47.65]The alien's gonna get dumped in the incinerator.
[408:02.99]Anymore?
[408:03.57]No, it's just... I'm just like, fuck it.
[408:07.56]I don't even care.
[408:08.76]Do it.
[408:12.64]Looks fairly clean.
[408:17.36]Look left.
[408:17.96]Look left.
[408:18.54]Look left.
[408:20.92]Oh.
[408:23.84]That's bad.
[408:26.21]Oh my god.
[408:27.03]Why did I just do that?
[408:28.03]I could have picked him up.
[408:28.87]Why did I just stick up like a fire poker?
[408:44.30]God damn it.
[408:48.48]I gotta come back down here again now.
[408:50.30]Oh.
[408:51.00]Oh well.
[409:01.56]Alright, blood is all clean.
[409:02.72]Easy.
[409:14.37]Walk it out.
[409:16.03]Is there a bucket in front of me?
[409:19.31]No.
[409:19.91]I moved him to the- I wasn't an idiot and I moved him to the sides.
[409:22.07]Okay.
[409:35.70]Clean the basement.
[409:37.94]There ain't no basement, I know.
[409:45.82]Good.
[409:56.28]Okay, what else is down here?
[409:57.63]There's a couple of pieces.
[409:58.69]I can put it in a bucket.
[409:59.75]I'll be fine.
[410:11.05]Get in there.
[410:13.81]Okay, who cares about the USBs?
[410:27.20]Can I get the head in there too?
[410:28.16]It's gonna be tight.
[410:32.66]And then the asparagus.
[410:33.94]I don't think I can get the asparagus in there.
[410:49.15]Oh yeah, I can.
[410:49.95]Don't tell me I can't do anything.
[411:04.57]Let's get it out.
[411:12.43]Clean the roof?
[411:14.07]Oh my god.
[411:15.93]The roof is clean!
[411:16.83]I had the asparagus in there already!
[411:20.98]The roof is clean!
[411:25.38]The roof is clean!
[411:40.56]God damn it.
[411:41.30]It was ready to go.
[411:42.08]I had to look over a chat for that one second.
[411:52.09]That's gonna fall out.
[412:13.83]I don't give a fuck about the chips.
[412:15.65]I'm not going to dock points because of potato chips.
[412:21.25]Alright, I'm out of here.
[412:25.84]Looks fine.
[412:26.84]Who cares about the DVDs?
[412:36.50]No, the body bag, right?
[412:37.76]The big body bag.
[412:38.65]I'll get the big body bag.
[413:21.82]Got it.
[413:22.04]Alright.
[413:23.06]Big chunk gone.
[413:27.06]These two.
[413:28.26]Put them together.
[413:29.20]I'm not gonna leave a huge mess.
[413:37.89]These are gonna spill, potentially, but it's okay.
[413:42.99]That huge fucking thing is not- Just close it!
[413:44.77]Just burn the thing, for Christ's sake!
[413:46.34]Come on!
[413:48.02]Come on!
[413:49.40]Come on!
[413:51.02]You done?
[414:03.58]He's losing it.
[414:06.54]I lost it a long time ago.
[414:10.86]Probably.
[414:13.43]This doesn't seem very relaxing.
[414:19.74]Well, this one has been stressful because I'm trying to get it done as fast as I humanly possibly can.
[414:28.03]Okay, that's it.
[414:32.23]Check around?
[414:33.01]Ooh, hold on.
[414:42.08]Okay.
[414:48.63]What about the medkits?
[414:49.41]Ah, everybody's dead anyways.
[414:55.51]One, two... Ah, you know, I'm looking at it already.
[414:57.69]Might as well just do it.
[414:59.43]What are there, two?
[415:00.45]Three that I can see up here?
[415:14.64]There's a ladder and a shipment container.
[415:19.36]Let's take a look.
[415:19.82]Because I'm done.
[415:35.89]Why is that even a feature?
[415:39.65]You know, that don't add nothing.
[415:41.43]That adds nothing.
[415:42.15]You're gonna press the button again anyways.
[415:51.59]Where's this ladder?
[416:09.55]You have to air strafe.
[416:15.91]That's it.
[416:17.07]Let's see if I got 80% or not.
[416:23.33]Where do I clock out?
[416:24.03]Over here?
[416:28.18]Activate.
[416:30.28]I'm proud of my work.
[416:31.20]Tell me what I did.
[416:51.41]That's an 87.
[416:57.40]I'll take an 87% in an hour.
[416:59.82]87% is demoted?
[417:10.63]Apparently so.
[417:11.59]Maybe because I did 99% last time.
[417:14.13]It's probably something like that.
[417:20.15]That one was pretty cool.
[417:23.58]And that's going to be it.
[417:25.02]We're at the 7 hour mark.
[417:27.64]I'll see you guys tomorrow for some Hit and Run.
[417:31.04]Mr. Cleanup Detail, the game's really, really fun.
[417:34.37]It's really interesting.
[417:35.55]I love it.
[417:37.91]I will see you guys tomorrow for Simpsons Hit and Run.
[417:40.03]Have a great rest of your night.
[417:48.41]If somebody were to shit all over your bathroom and then you cleaned 87% of it... Yeah, I guess you're right.
[417:56.94]There'll still be some shit in there, right?
[418:00.90]I'm going to do the bits.
[418:01.74]We'll do the subs.
[418:02.36]But I got to pee real bad.
[418:04.51]So I'll be right back.
[418:06.09]We'll finish up.
[418:07.55]If you're taking off, see you tomorrow.
[418:09.61]Or maybe see you when you come back.
[418:11.33]Whenever.
[418:12.87]Take care.
[418:13.65]See you real soon.
[418:14.79]I'll be right back.
[420:12.26]All right.
[420:15.00]Let me exit this game.
[420:18.58]Close it up.
[420:23.87]I've been doing some long streams lately.
[420:27.65]Oh, kind of.
[420:29.61]I mean, I'm just having fun.
[420:39.74]Let's put this on because that's where we are.
[420:46.41]Let's go to a while ago.
[420:48.59]About seven-ish hours ago.
[420:56.87]Have a great night, everybody.
[420:58.69]And let's do the bits.
[421:00.79]Thank you, Dennis, for the $1.
[421:03.56]Thank you, Divas, for the $3.
[421:06.20]Mr. Pigeon for the $1.
[421:07.34]A girl said she wanted a thick boy.
[421:10.86]Offered it myself and she responded with an oof.
[421:17.85]I don't know why I read it like that, but I did.
[421:21.12]Thank you, Binary Man, for the six dollars.
[421:23.08]Thank you, Binary Man.
[421:26.38]Uh, hey, Germa, I made this while you were waiting for the stream to start.
[421:28.64]There's a gnome.
[421:32.70]Well, why would you tell me there's a gnome?
[421:34.28]... ... ... ...
[421:48.93]Is that it?
[421:55.97]Did you make that?
[421:56.55]I'm not sure you made that.
[421:57.63]Did you?
[422:01.74]Thank you for the six dollars.
[422:06.82]Here's a link to it if you want to look at it.
[422:09.84]Let me get it up there.
[422:17.22]Listen to the whole thing?
[422:18.62]I don't want to listen to the... I can't even do it, I'm too tired.
[422:29.90]We did Donkey Kong Country, right?
[422:39.85]Also, is it true that you finished Red Dead 2 and Monster Hunter World off-stream?
[422:43.47]Yes.
[422:44.49]What's the final verdict?
[422:45.69]I thought they were both great.
[422:48.19]Monster Hunter World is really, really cool.
[422:51.06]I got to the point where I completed the story and kind of... They were still monsters to hunt?
[422:58.86]But I didn't really play much after the story ended.
[423:02.06]And same thing with Red Dead.
[423:03.02]I did all the side content, side stranger missions, and the main story, and that's kind of where I left it.
[423:08.14]I thought they were both good.
[423:12.30]I had a lot of fun with both of them.
[423:15.72]Thank you, Snoozing Copter, for the $1.00.
[423:19.04]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[423:20.52]Summer Lovin'.
[423:25.30]I've heard this already.
[423:34.39]Do you eat ass?
[423:37.55]I've heard that.
[423:38.07]Didn't we already play this before?
[423:39.43]Of course I do.
[423:40.76]We already played this before.
[423:45.49]Did we?
[423:45.93]My brain cannot remember that shit, but I think we did.
[423:49.41]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[423:50.55]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim for the three bucks.
[423:55.66]Love you, Germ.
[423:56.30]The only reason George R.R.
[423:57.46]Martin hasn't finished Game of Thrones is because he's too busy making daily English TV cameos.
[424:04.14]Is he not?
[424:07.66]On the phone, a less formal call.
[424:11.30]Good afternoon, Scott and Smith.
[424:12.95]May I help you?
[424:14.03]May I speak to Mr. Scott or Mr. Smith, please?
[424:17.07]I'm sorry, they aren't here right now.
[424:19.05]Who's calling, please?
[424:20.29]George Martin.
[424:21.57]Is there any message I can take, Mr. Martin?
[424:23.85]No, I'll call back later.
[424:25.35]Why?
[424:26.55]That's weird.
[424:29.77]That's very strange.
[424:30.57]When did this come out?
[424:36.01]This came out in 2018, so... Somebody's making a funny thing there.
[424:42.90]But thank you, Timmy Tim Tam.
[424:44.88]Thank you for the $4 total here, Timmy.
[424:49.38]Just donated $3 and the bot deleted my message because I linked a daily English TV video.
[424:57.16]No, it went through.
[424:57.76]It's there.
[425:00.68]We saw it.
[425:01.06]I don't know why it deleted it.
[425:03.73]It's up here, right here.
[425:08.29]Thank you, Ilmsal, for the $1.
[425:10.29]I love this game, but please use speedrun mode.
[425:12.41]It adds a timer and removes random body parts from the bucket dispenser.
[425:18.77]That's actually really, really cool to know, because I did not know what that did.
[425:23.21]So.
[425:27.79]That's pretty cool.
[425:30.39]Thank you for the $1.
[425:32.35]Thank you, I'm Monk, for the $1.
[425:33.97]I watched ads to get enough bits to say I love you, Jerma Heart.
[425:40.20]Thank you so much.
[425:41.28]Hopefully you're not suffering through these ads too much.
[425:45.58]For me.
[425:49.87]Thank you, though.
[425:54.19]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[425:55.85]Hey, Jamie, pull up that video of that weird streamer talking about watching the podcast.
[426:01.13]Look at this goofy motherfucker.
[426:02.55]What the fuck is a shpee?
[426:04.45]Joe Rogan.
[426:11.01]Alright, because we're talking about Joe Rogan.
[426:12.40]Man, that was like seven hours ago.
[426:15.66]I don't even remember what happened 45 minutes ago.
[426:20.54]Who's Jamie?
[426:23.44]I've never watched Joe Rogan's podcast.
[426:27.02]I don't even know what Joe Rogan's voice sounds like.
[426:34.07]I don't think I was trying to be funny.
[426:35.35]Throwing stuff.
[426:35.83]I was trying to get it out of the way.
[426:37.05]Thank you, though.
[427:05.40]Thank you ExtraCheesy for the $1, Mafia City, there it is.
[427:09.56]The guy turns into level 30?
[427:16.01]Do people play this game?
[427:32.20]How many downloads does this have?
[427:40.19]Uh, well, Vegas just has so many... There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of restaurants around in Vegas.
[428:09.08]Boston has great food, Boston has great seafood.
[428:12.12]But if you're looking for variety, Vegas is, I think, just where it's at.
[428:17.68]He's a questionable streamer.
[428:24.48]But thank you, though.
[428:26.00]Sorry you missed the New Year's Eve stream.
[428:29.71]I had fun.
[428:32.83]Hey Zach, play a game now, thanks for the $1.
[428:34.95]Play royalty-free Christmas music.
[428:38.07]Nah, you can't do that in January.
[428:41.29]You start doing that in November.
[428:43.40]You can't do that in January after 1st.
[428:52.44]I can't do that.
[428:54.22]Hey, bank me home.
[428:54.82]Thanks for the $1 bits.
[428:55.98]Thank you.
[428:59.93]We also had a dollar from Katayusha Alexandra for the $1.
[429:06.14]So my birthday was recently and I thought I'd give a bit of money that I got from family.
[429:11.09]While I can't make it to every stream, I do know I can always enjoy watching and interacting with everybody in the community.
[429:16.65]To my heart.
[429:19.57]Hey, thanks a lot.
[429:21.60]Happy birthday.
[429:23.62]Hope you have a good one.
[429:29.58]Don't worry about not being able to make it to every stream.
[429:32.78]There are a lot of them and they go a long time.
[429:36.44]I can't expect people to make every second of the stream.
[429:40.13]It's a long time.
[429:43.81]Thank you, though.
[429:46.37]$10 from Cyprus.
[429:47.27]Thank you, Cyprus, for the $10.
[429:48.41]Jeremy, you reminded me of this game.
[429:51.02]Thank you so much.
[429:53.56]Game is awesome.
[429:55.60]It's fun just to clean shit up.
[429:58.82]Make a mess, have fun.
[429:59.92]It's awesome.
[430:00.38]I love it.
[430:01.57]Thank you for the $10. $10.
[430:10.08]Hey, Katayusha, again for the $1.
[430:11.86]The Yakuza boss just busted into your house and is threatening to smoke you.
[430:15.84]What do you do?
[430:20.71]What boss is this?
[430:27.07]The Mustard Family Lieutenant McDonald's?
[430:33.66]I would probably just... I don't know.
[430:46.22]They'd probably just close the door.
[430:48.82]And be like, nah.
[430:53.49]They'd be like, I don't think I want to fight anybody.
[431:00.39]Thank you, C4G, for the two bucks.

[431:19.71]You promised a Fortnite dance.
[431:20.87]What?
[431:24.53]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[431:30.29]Fortnite dance?
[431:36.14]Huh.
[431:36.28]Sounds interesting, whatever it is.
[431:39.02]Hey, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[431:43.34]Just wanted to let you know that Vinny's chat uses the minus two joke every time he plays this clip.
[431:51.59]What is this?
[431:52.57]Wait, minus two?
[431:55.90]I don't know what that is.
[432:05.84]That's Harry Potter?
[432:08.10]No, that's not Harry Potter.
[432:10.20]That is Frodo.
[432:13.14]That is Frodo.
[432:16.83]And Tall Wizard.
[432:19.13]What's his name?

[432:34.85]Ah, shit, I missed you.
[432:39.73]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[432:41.16]You need to stop using the I'm naked excuse for your webcam, since, you know, you live with italics now.
[432:47.62]Were you here when he told, when he talked about, uh, on stream, that this is real?
[432:53.65]He, by his own admission, you can ask him.
[433:01.47]We talked about that during EDF, me, him, and Star.
[433:03.76]I have no clothes on right now.
[433:07.78]I'm not wearing a shirt.
[433:09.98]I wear pants.
[433:15.52]Yeah, he already talked about it.
[433:22.62]Alfa.
[433:29.80]Naked while he's wearing pants.
[433:42.19]Thanks a lot though.
[433:44.83]Yes is online.
[433:46.63]Thank you, the $15.
[433:50.66]Uh... Yes is online.
[433:52.65]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[433:53.97]Thank you, your streams combined with MBV's loveless have kept me sane while working on projects.
[434:00.29]I'm even flying to Boston to film on location with your green screen footage.
[434:04.71]Thanks for inspiring me.
[434:06.29]Plus cheers from Pittsburgh.
[434:10.19]What are you gonna do with me?
[434:13.03]On location with my green screen footage?
[434:23.41]Thank you for the $15 and good luck with, uh, good luck with whatever you're working on.
[434:29.57]That sounds pretty cool.
[434:34.63]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[434:38.22]Hey Optimus, thanks for the $2, Optimus.
[434:41.02]Hey Gemma, thanks for the great Christmas stream and New Year's stream.
[434:42.90]I was wondering if you have seen Into the Spider-Verse yet.
[434:46.96]Also, I thought the world needed to see the best joke of 2019.
[434:49.14]I have not seen Into the Spider-Verse, no.
[434:53.58]See you in the next video guys.
[435:20.84]Well, no, I've not seen Into the Spider-Verse.
[435:23.72]That was an air raid siren?
[435:27.54]Nah, I'm looking forward to seeing it though.
[435:29.60]I'll let you know what I do.
[435:32.12]Thanks for the two bucks.
[435:34.77]Captain Morgan, thanks for the one dollar.
[435:35.95]Hey Jerma, saw you in Las Vegas the other day.
[435:37.65]Wanted to say something, but you knocked me down and started throwing pocket rats at me.
[435:42.85]Italics tried to help me out, but you shoved them aside and started throwing rats at them.
[435:46.35]Despite the ordeal, I'm glad you signed my t-shirt.
[435:48.29]You know, your signature looks like a footprint.
[435:53.19]Hey, thank you, the one Freeman for the two bucks.
[435:55.49]What is going on?
[436:20.72]We talked about binaural audio, but when am I breaking into somebody's house?
[436:35.09]Thank you, the one free man.

[437:41.49]I probably am not going to.
[437:43.61]I've made the final decision that it's probably not something I'm gonna do on stream.
[437:46.54]I don't really play it.
[437:47.34]I played it for a little while and I just... I just couldn't get into it.
[437:51.56]My brain couldn't lock into playing it.
[437:55.77]So, probably not.
[438:00.95]But thank you for the $20, Manny.
[438:04.49]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1 worst joke in 2019.
[438:07.27]Is this the signer?
[438:09.09]Here's the full OST of Star Wars.
[438:24.90]No.
[438:25.58]That would be a bad joke.
[438:30.14]That's the worst joke of 2019.
[438:30.92]That's the worst joke in the last five years.
[438:34.65]that's the worst joke in the last 10 years that's the worst thing I've ever said ever and I mean ever and I'm talking about in my life not wrong uh hey ghiatio thanks for the ten dollars no message thank you for ten bucks ghiatio jerma is the best thanks for the ten bucks and what an interesting username that is thank you for the ten dollars

[439:51.98]I appreciate it.
[439:53.16]Marvash Magali, thanks for the one dollar.
[439:54.54]This is the secret bit that will show up after the outro in second German.
[439:57.96]You better do something funny quick.
[440:01.81]Um... I don't think I can.
[440:06.17]I don't think I can.
[440:17.27]Fortnite dance.
[440:26.80]So sad.
[440:27.72]What?
[440:32.82]Why was it sad?
[440:36.12]What's sad?
[440:39.88]Thank you Errorless for the $1.23.
[440:41.66]I love how recent games have turned these into OST streams.
[440:46.90]Also, this was a perfect laid-back cleaning stream from my sick day, so thanks.
[440:52.18]Yeah, this game's great.
[440:54.11]I love just dicking around in this game.
[440:57.85]Don't be feel better.
[441:02.55]Also, Potato Wizard Academy, thanks for the $1.00.
[441:04.57]Are you gonna play Smash Ultimate?
[441:07.15]I am not.
[441:08.43]Let's just put this to bed right now.
[441:09.89]I am not going to play Smash Bros.
[441:13.67]on this stream.
[441:14.67]Let's just put it to rest.
[441:16.59]Bury it.
[441:20.42]But thank you.
[441:23.52]The rewind joke was not very relaxed.
[441:27.82]No, it wasn't.
[441:28.54]Blood was coming out of my eyes.
[441:29.66]Yeah, what a relaxing day.
[441:32.32]Blood came out of all of my face.
[441:37.86]Thank you, Potato Wizard.
[441:42.19]We also had... Comfort Eagle gave a shitload of money tonight.
[441:49.71]Talked about the $50 already, but another $25 from Comfort Eagle.
[441:54.98]Hold shift when carrying stacked items to avoid mega spills.
[441:59.46]I did try that.
[442:00.42]I was doing it.
[442:02.46]But sometimes they just tip over.
[442:06.84]Because shift is walk.
[442:09.84]but thank you.
[442:13.38]Spilled stuff on purpose.
[442:18.00]That's the thing.
[442:18.78]I can say this a thousand more times, but those of you that think truly that me like throwing something down a hall and knocking over the bucket or bumping into a bucket is me putting on a joke.
[442:34.01]No, I got news for you.
[442:37.27]You know, maybe it's better that way.
[442:39.29]That people think that.
[442:44.79]Because if I'm doing it on purpose, then I'm not really that stupid.
[442:49.75]Right?
[442:50.53]And not really that careless.
[442:53.63]So it's like, oh, he's making jokes here.
[442:55.93]This is a joke.
[442:57.43]Then there's no way he's this careless.
[443:00.13]That's what your mindset is.
[443:01.75]If I'm doing it on purpose.
[443:03.82]So...
[443:06.57]I guess we could maybe keep that going.
[443:13.57]Someone came in during the green screen stream and thought you were self-centered.
[443:24.26]Well, I mean... How could you not think that?
[443:27.86]I'm doing a night where look at me on the screen.
[443:41.60]But I mean, could it really be self-centered if I show on screen me using a stepladder to get groceries?
[443:50.16]Wouldn't I want to have like stuff that makes me look good?
[444:00.01]He made all of these and is laughing at them.
[444:02.47]Oh, I see.
[444:04.75]That would have been a lot of work.
[444:07.97]Holy shit, imagine if I made all 400 fucking of those videos in two weeks.
[444:20.56]That's not even humanly possible.
[444:26.14]Number one JoJo fan.
[444:27.58]Yeah, I made all the JoJo videos, why not?
[444:34.89]But it's all good.
[444:41.18]But thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1.
[444:42.70]You say you don't like being naked, but you're naked constantly.
[444:46.88]I'm just, like, half naked.
[444:49.80]But I don't want to put clothes on, because then I have to, I could put, turn the camera on.
[444:54.61]Turn on the cam.
[444:56.79]Gotta have a shirt on and shit.
[444:58.61]No, no, no.
[445:04.02]I'm gonna sneeze.
[445:05.22]So, I'll see you in a minute.
[445:12.71]Okay, I think we're good.
[445:14.40]Yeah, wait, no, another one coming on?
[445:16.70]Maybe?
[445:17.92]Hey, Optimus, thanks for the $1, Optimus.

[445:27.35]Thank you, Jamie, for the $1.
[445:28.81]That rewind joke already wins.
[445:30.35]Best joke of 2019.
[445:31.05]Don't be so sure.
[445:37.11]William, thank you, William, for the $15.
[445:38.64]That was an A-plus bit.
[445:43.37]Thank you, William, if you're still here.
[445:47.70]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1 chat.
[445:49.46]We need to fix the timeline.
[445:50.94]Like, seriously, it's fucking with my OCD.
[445:55.48]It went its own way.
[445:57.71]We went back and we went a different way, I guess.
[446:01.21]So that's from what I've told, what chat told me.
[446:05.71]But thank you so much, Demonic Cucumber, for your at least $3 or $4, even $5 tonight.

[446:15.58]Solid Milk, thanks for the $1, Derma.

[446:21.47]Uh, yeah, you could.
[446:25.75]If more than 500 people left, press the button.
[446:29.51]Thank you, Solid Milk.

[447:06.36]I think we have a great relationship.
[447:07.53]What are you talking about?
[447:13.57]Imagine if Dr. Phil with chat is the... Actually, that's kind of a funny idea.
[447:21.80]Sitting there, being dead serious, talking about chat.
[447:26.32]And all you see is like, OWOs and fucking smiley face, I made this and shit like that while I'm trying to have a deep conversation on Dr. Phil with you guys.

[452:23.34]It's fucking ridiculous.
[452:33.11]Yeah.
[452:34.95]It's insane.
[452:45.54]How do you think I keep renting out this studio, guys?
[452:51.80]I mean, think about it.
[453:07.61]I told you, guys.
[453:08.29]I told you.
[453:08.89]Whatever money comes in, at a certain point, it goes right back in.
[453:20.66]But the studio.
[453:31.87]How much of the money goes to Soylent?
[453:35.22]It would be way too much because Soylent is incredibly expensive.
[453:43.56]Yeah, I got a stacked fridge of Soylent.
[453:45.79]No, that's not true.
[453:47.13]I can't say that.
[453:47.75]That's a fucking lie.
[453:48.99]That's a joke.
[453:49.65]I don't want to go down this road.
[453:51.97]What I just said right there was a fucking lie.
[453:53.85]It was a joke.
[453:55.07]I have no affiliation at all with any company, especially ones that I may have just said.
[454:02.35]That was a joke.
[454:03.21]It didn't mean anything.
[454:05.15]Thank you, Welt, for the $3.
[454:08.51]Thank you STJAR for the $2.
[454:10.01]I was wondering if you even wanted to do merch.
[454:12.72]I would buy... Oh, that's... Oh my god, I completely forgot.
[454:16.82]I was supposed to talk about this during the stream.
[454:18.68]Shirts are coming.
[454:20.54]In a couple weeks.
[454:23.10]The Glue Man shirt is coming back.
[454:25.10]And the Solar System shirt.
[454:27.02]The new shirt is coming too.
[454:28.52]At the same time.
[454:31.99]So, at some point before January is over, there will be two new shirts that you can purchase.
[454:40.98]How limited is the run?
[454:42.07]If it's possible, I may just make it permanent.
[454:47.23]So, if it's something I can do.
[455:02.04]If not, then I'll run as long as I can of a campaign on Teespring.
[455:11.17]I will find out those details in the next couple of weeks.
[455:20.96]So those are the two shirts that you will see.
[455:30.83]But thank you, STGRO.
[455:32.27]Hopefully that answers the question.
[455:33.35]Attack of the Hank.
[455:34.33]Thanks for the $1.00.
[455:36.00]When you first started carrying around four buckets of the top floor, I said as a joke, chat, I fast forwarded and he drops four buckets, trying to fit them all in the incinerator at once.
[455:45.50]And when he did exactly that later in the stream, I freaked the fuck out.
[455:53.21]Yeah.
[455:56.21]Yeah.
[455:57.37]Yeah.
[456:00.55]Yeah.
[456:05.64]I'm not fu- I'm really just dumb.
[456:08.74]I'm not du- look, I'm not dumb, okay?
[456:11.98]I am not a dumb person.
[456:13.88]I am a clumsy, absent-minded person.
[456:17.86]I'm not dumb, okay?
[456:19.10]This like, this thing about like, I'm how he's dumb.
[456:22.59]I'm not dumb.
[456:25.57]I just walk into fucking doors and bump into tables and knock over fucking buckets and shit.
[456:30.63]I'm a little clumsy.
[456:44.93]I think you are smart.
[456:50.53]Jeremy, you once bet that corn grows on trees.
[456:54.91]Okay, you are talking about a quote and a picture I was drawing in the middle of a gerbil video game.
[457:07.65]Really?
[457:09.97]I was playing the gerbil Disney game.
[457:20.71]We weren't having an intellectual conversation.
[457:24.32]I was rolling around in a gerbil ball.
[457:30.48]G-Force, that's the one, right.
[457:48.07]I'm just kidding.
[457:48.59]All right.
[457:48.81]Thank you super sale for the one dollar Wow What a clean streamer and I'll phone you could clean that dirty mouth of yours.
[457:52.95]Haha Yeah, that's true Matters of darkness thanks to the seventeen dollars and fifty cents nearly twenty twenty bucks Play the curb your enthusiasm theme or riot but during when I was dropping all those stupid tools I
[458:18.13]When am I gonna play SWAT 4?
[458:21.13]Um... Probably pretty soon.
[458:31.22]I have to imagine it'll be in the next few weeks.
[458:36.18]But thank you for the $20, Matters of Darkness.
[458:38.82]It's a lot.
[458:41.42]Did they really do that?
[458:43.02]They gave out most of their albums for free?
[458:44.86]That's kinda cool.
[458:46.36]Damn.
[459:11.50]But thanks for the $5.
[459:12.04]It's too late for me to play.
[459:19.86]Pure Bread, thanks for the $5.
[459:22.12]Extra Cheesy, thanks for the $1.
[459:27.98]Alec again, thanks for the $1.
[459:29.62]If you were an anime protagonist, your ultimate power would be the ability to turn one stain into 50,000 stains and then take five hours cleaning up your own mess.
[459:40.20]That didn't happen.
[459:46.43]Thank you, Alec.
[459:47.11]It was my $50 you missed earlier, but just play the Super Mario Galaxy OST.
[459:53.32]Did I?
[459:53.94]I did?
[459:57.72]Did I really miss a $50 bit donation from you?
[460:01.78]Did I?
[460:07.24]Holy shit.
[460:10.35]I touched upon it a little while ago, right?
[460:12.59]Like half an hour ago?
[460:13.63]Yeah, I did, didn't I?
[460:24.48]Because I'm, hold on, I'm scrolling back here.
[460:36.07]From, I'm back like eight, hold on a minute.
[460:40.73]Because I... I'm at, because I see three days ago, which is the last time I streamed, and then eight hours ago.
[460:52.04]I swear I touched upon it.
[460:53.79]Let me just make sure.
[461:11.48]No, I don't see it here.
[461:12.44]It was way back near the stream start?
[461:25.36]Because I see... Did, like, Streamlabs eat this donation?
[461:32.46]Because I see Stormy chews.
[461:36.62]And that was, like, seven and a half hours ago.
[461:50.41]Yeah, I don't know.
[461:50.91]That's weird.
[461:54.64]Well, sorry that happened.
[461:55.66]Because, yeah, I don't see them anywhere around here.
[462:03.30]But, we're almost done.
[462:07.38]Let's go back to your original message here.
[462:11.16]Let's see.
[462:25.07]I'm just checking it one more time.
[462:27.39]Because that's really not cool if that happened.
[462:34.53]But thank you, Alec.
[462:37.29]Play Super Mario Galaxy OST.
[462:39.65]Save it for next time.
[462:40.89]I'm sure we'll be playing that game again.
[462:49.00]But thank you so much.
[462:50.42]Thank you, C4G, for the $1.
[462:51.54]Did somebody say Thunder Fury, Blessed Blade, or the Wind Seeker?
[462:56.81]I remember that.
[462:58.07]Those were the days.
[462:59.83]Mr. Avocado Man, thanks for the three bucks.
[463:02.08]Happy birthday to us.
[463:05.04]Happy birthday to us.
[463:06.90]Happy birthday.
[463:21.51]I remember that.
[463:22.73]Yep.
[463:24.37]I remember sitting there and having people spam that.
[463:27.27]Because only like one person on the server ever had that thing.
[463:30.75]So they would log on to World of Warcraft.
[463:33.25]And the first thing they did, they got their morning coffee, they take a couple sips, and then they just spam that in the chat.
[463:41.20]Every day.
[463:48.34]Alright, getting close to the end of the bits.
[463:51.61]We are at...
[463:55.03]Uh... The True, thank you The True Michi for the $1, thank you for making me laugh, LUL.
[464:01.33]Oh and also, Discord seems pretty empty, I got no message from somebody who wanted to message me.
[464:10.32]I'll fucking, I'll give him a stir in talking too, after the stream.
[464:20.22]Sounded out German, LUL.
[464:28.44]I'm gonna- I'll give him a stern talking to after the stream, about that.
[464:35.51]Thank you, Trumichi.
[464:38.13]MissPens, thanks for the two bucks.
[464:39.71]You wanna come clean my place?
[464:42.17]No.
[464:44.53]I'll knock over all your stuff.
[464:46.70]Except how your fridge will tip over.
[464:49.52]Uh, Platu- Platu-Tudonius, thanks for the five dollars.
[464:55.01]Hey Jerma, you're doing a great job of quickly and effectively cleaning.
[464:58.51]Just want to make sure you saw this fan art by Angus McCloud on your subreddit.
[465:04.28]Ayayay.
[465:16.79]That's fantastic.
[465:17.87]Thank you.
[465:22.83]That's very good.
[465:30.33]The spill joke.
[465:33.47]Thank you, E-Dragon, for the $8.
[465:34.75]Hey, Jerma, are you ever going to do that music-making stream you planned before you moved?
[465:40.97]Yes.
[465:42.81]It is on the distant cards.
[465:45.09]And by distant, I mean at least a couple months.
[465:48.07]Because there are very, very specific things that I want to do for that stream that need planning.
[465:54.11]Need a lot of planning.
[465:55.01]So, yes, you'll see it.
[465:59.33]Pretzel Foxtrot, thanks for the $15.
[466:03.83]Sorry that the Goonies stole all your money.
[466:07.79]Pretzel Foxtrot, by the way.
[466:09.61]You still here?
[466:11.71]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[466:14.63]Uh, Pretzel Foxtrot.
[466:17.81]Is somebody.
[466:19.37]So, me, Kim, and Italics were out a couple nights ago.
[466:24.97]And Pretzel Foxtrot happened to stumble upon us.
[466:31.84]Hung out, talked for a while.
[466:34.90]Took a picture or two.
[466:35.66]Uh, yeah.
[466:39.59]Just a good dude.
[466:41.75]That was a pleasure.
[466:50.23]That's where the picture comes from.
[466:52.75]If you saw that on Twitter.
[466:57.53]It was super fun.
[466:58.25]I'm glad to hear that.
[467:00.99]It was great.
[467:03.67]Just sitting there, like, sipping a wine.
[467:07.01]Hanging out.
[467:09.77]You said how drunk you were.
[467:11.71]What?
[467:15.28]But thank you so much for the $15.
[467:16.76]I did lose... Well, I gained, like, $30.
[467:20.92]And then I lost $25, I think, in the Goonies machine.
[467:26.31]And I said, I'm never playing ever again.
[467:33.60]You were right there for that.
[467:38.98]But, thanks again.
[467:42.25]DarkSoul115, thanks for the $5.
[467:47.17]Have you played Nier yet?
[467:50.65]Automata.
[467:52.14]If not, I would love to see you play it on stream.
[467:54.16]Even though I understand if it doesn't seem like your kind of game.
[468:00.08]Hmm.
[468:02.29]Hmm.
[468:03.77]I don't know.
[468:04.13]Not yet.
[468:05.47]I need to space those games out.
[468:07.77]Games like... Metal Gear Rising.
[468:11.87]Super fast-paced action games.
[468:14.15]I kind of need time between them.
[468:24.84]Does seem like it's pretty fun.
[468:33.52]And also, I'm buying a Fireman shirt and can't wait to wear them around everywhere and be shunned for watching the streamer who made the Star Wars siren joke.
[468:45.07]I mean, it is embarrassing.
[468:47.87]No, not to wear the shirt, but what I did.
[468:52.71]What is with me in saying things that out of context are just bad?
[468:57.29]The last couple days, the last three days, the last two streams, I've said a couple of things that just were not in the correct context.
[469:08.73]But, thank you.
[469:10.59]Hey, a plastic spork.
[469:11.47]Thanks for the two bucks.
[469:12.25]Hey, German, just want to take this time to thank you for getting me through a really hard time last year.
[469:17.17]I had to deal with a move from Idaho to Oregon.
[469:21.25]Lasting grief from a late pet and getting my driver's license quick before the move all at about the same time.
[469:27.10]It's because of you and your amazing fan base that I stayed through, sane through that time.
[469:32.32]Your community is so welcoming and sweet and we're all here to see the same funny, caring, amazing streamer.
[469:37.04]German Hart, thank you.
[469:40.90]Thanks for the $2, and... Yeah, it's always a good time here.
[469:45.46]Always.
[469:51.63]Yeah, we fuck around a lot, and I do dumb shit, I say dumb shit.
[469:55.15]Oh, but just jokes, you know what I mean?
[469:56.71]We just fuck around.
[469:58.62]It's a great fucking community, you guys are amazing.
[470:06.23]Good shit all around.
[470:07.43]For real.
[470:08.75]Am I going to stream Sekiro?
[470:09.91]Absolutely.
[470:10.73]100%.
[470:11.01]Yes.
[470:16.21]And then Plastic Spork again for the $3.
[470:20.00]They say Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100.
[470:22.76]Anyway, enough of that sappy shit.
[470:25.14]Damn, Jerma, are you a donkey in a desert?
[470:28.62]Because that ass is... Thank you.
[470:35.58]Okay.
[470:36.37]Thank you.
[470:37.69]Okay.
[470:38.15]Thank you.
[470:40.35]Hey, uh, Bingo.
[470:42.03]Bingo.
[470:42.41]Thanks for the one doll.
[470:43.13]Thanks for the laughs, the goofs, and the gaffs.
[470:45.49]As a streamer, you add a lot to the community and you deserve to know.
[470:48.82]Glad you're here, my dude.
[470:52.26]Uh, I can say the same thing to you.
[470:54.16]So, thank you so much.
[470:58.45]The Sarobert, thanks for the $1.14.
[471:01.51]My boyfriend has been watching you since he was in the 7th grade.
[471:04.81]He's in the 12th grade now, and he introduced me to your channel, and you're one of his favorite streamers.
[471:09.23]One of my favorite streamers.
[471:10.91]We sing the birthday mixtape at his birthday every year.
[471:13.97]Can you say, Hey, Phillip.
[471:17.59]Hey, Phillips.
[471:18.87]So I can send him a video of you saying it.
[471:20.39]He loves your videos and shows me the TF2 classics.
[471:24.60]Well, I gotta say something more than, Hey, Phillip.
[471:29.06]Hey, Phillips.
[471:31.48]Hey, congratulations.
[471:34.50]No, hold on.
[471:35.28]That's too generic.
[471:36.85]Hey, happy birthday, Phillips.
[471:38.97]Every year you're going to listen to this.
[471:40.55]Until you're 70.
[471:42.81]Happy... Let's go over all of them.
[471:45.65]Happy 20th birthday.
[471:47.83]21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 29th, 30th.
[471:52.52]And then just like, you don't know.
[471:54.48]Happy birthday every single birthday after that, Phillips.
[471:59.37]Have a great day!
[472:02.41]Thank you, the Sarah Burt's for the $1.14.
[472:04.57]Somebody just ha-ha'd me.
[472:11.29]What?
[472:11.57]Come on, I'm just doing a birthday thing!
[472:15.55]I'm just doing a birthday thing.
[472:30.58]I got ha-ha'd for that.
[472:31.64]Did you ha-ha me at all during the fucking dog shit jokes I was making during the stream?
[472:38.85]There was at least one or two opportunities for you to use that.
[472:42.09]Not here.
[472:53.34]How dare you.
[472:55.60]Hey Novi, thanks for the $3.33.
[472:57.28]German, what is your liquor of choice other than Johnny Walker Blue?
[473:02.58]I'm looking to branch out.
[473:03.40]Johnny Walker Blue is insanely expensive, but it's my favorite whiskey ever.
[473:13.02]If you don't drink cider, forget about liquor.
[473:16.38]Cider, hard cider is great.
[473:25.68]My favorite cider ever is Down East.
[473:29.59]It's hard to get, though.
[473:30.29]I think you can only get that in New England.
[473:32.97]You might be able to special order it, but it's my favorite cider.
[473:38.35]If you're talking about more hard alcohol, I don't really drink that much hard alcohol.
[473:47.84]Not anymore.
[473:48.96]Not anymore.
[473:51.33]I'm more of a light kind of cider, little bit of red wine, maybe a cocktail or two, but I'm not, I don't really drink that much hard alcohol anymore.
[474:06.90]Wine gives you a headache?
[474:08.42]Yeah, it can.
[474:15.85]You've actually seen down east in a liquor store here in
[474:20.52]Oh yeah, get it.
[474:23.20]If you're of age and you can drink, absolutely, it's great.
[474:27.97]Alright, coming down to the final 10.
[474:31.17]Alec 4x4 again, $11.
[474:32.48]I must have only given 20 earlier, so here's another 20.
[474:38.24]My bad.
[474:38.92]Don't worry about that, that's fine.
[474:46.60]Thank you so much for even considering giving me money.
[474:48.56]Don't feel bad if something happened and you need to give it.
[474:50.79]You don't have to worry about that.
[474:52.45]Thank you.
[474:57.39]Thanks for even any amount of money.
[475:00.98]And they say, get some sleep.
[475:03.34]I will.
[475:04.12]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[475:07.21]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[475:08.67]Hey Jerm, just wanted to give some more bits tonight.
[475:11.40]Because your stream always gives me a smile.
[475:13.58]I'm staying with my nan now, so it's looking up a bit.
[475:17.60]But you still help me get through the tough days.
[475:19.48]Thank you, handsome streamer.
[475:22.78]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[475:26.36]It's always a pleasure.
[475:29.89]Glad things are looking up.
[475:37.26]Much love to you.
[475:43.18]Take care of yourself.
[475:47.40]Handsome streamer.
[475:51.36]Oh, I was laughing.
[475:52.26]I don't know why this made me think about this, but I was laughing really hard.
[475:55.85]There's a picture that Kim took.
[476:00.10]Kim, like, Kim came in to give me, like, a kiss.
[476:02.98]And she snapped, like, a photo, right?
[476:04.74]And I was like, oh, whatever, that's fine, that's... That's cute, I guess, alright, that's cool.
[476:09.85]And somebody... Somebody doctored the photo.
[476:14.77]And... Made me... Kissing me.
[476:18.01]And I was like, what the fuck is this?
[476:24.75]It's so... It's... It's so odd.
[476:33.37]It's the oddest thing ever.
[476:35.33]It's just so uncomfortable to look at.
[476:37.01]Is that it right there?
[476:43.53]Yeah, look at that.
[476:44.65]Look at how strange that is.
[476:46.07]That's so strange.
[476:51.57]It's me...
[477:04.86]and me kissing each other.
[477:11.30]I don't even know.
[477:12.34]I can't even... it's hard.
[477:13.62]After a minute... after like 10 seconds I have to click off.
[477:24.18]I was in bed last night looking at that and I just shook my head back and forth.
[477:28.66]I was just like, what on earth is this?
[477:36.08]Cursed.
[477:37.92]I was laughing so fucking hard at it, though.
[477:43.12]But yeah, I don't know what made me think about that.
[477:45.32]Uh... Uh, thank you, sir... Tardigrade... For the $1.
[477:57.19]Hey, Jerem, I've been watching your YouTube channel since the TF2 days.
[478:00.79]And just recently started catching streams.
[478:04.18]These things are carrying me through high school, and I always have a good time.
[478:07.14]Thanks.
[478:11.57]Thank you.
[478:15.41]Since the TF2 days, I'm glad you guys still think it's worth watching after all that time.
[478:25.54]Demonic Cucumber, again, thanks for the $1.
[478:27.38]Final bits of the night.
[478:29.44]I at least try to keep a limit.
[478:30.98]Don't tell my mom that I gave you more than $5.
[478:32.89]P.S.
[478:34.65]I can't help but think of this whenever you rant about us making things up using audio clips.
[479:03.82]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[479:05.60]I actually have a clip of you doing a Fortnite dance already.
[479:08.88]See?
[479:09.16]I already did it.
[479:09.84]Uh, oh yeah, before I go, please do a Fortnite dance.
[479:15.65]I already did this.
[479:16.87]I told you, my favorite Fortnite dance.
[479:18.19]This one, the one with the fucking kid with the backpack on.
[479:21.05]This one.
[479:22.85]See?
[479:23.11]I already- I did it already.
[479:24.75]See?
[479:26.15]Told you that clip was from four months ago.
[479:30.61]Uh, put webcam on.
[479:31.81]Thank you for the bits.
[479:34.09]Them fightin' words, Cena.
[479:35.47]Have you ever seen that man's new hair?
[479:38.48]I have not seen Cena's new hair.
[479:40.66]I don't even know what he looks like.
[479:42.90]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[479:44.28]Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door has the best OST, Don't At Me.
[479:50.14]Never played it.
[479:56.29]Hey, Musty Facecloth, thanks for the $0 too.
[480:00.12]Hey, Jerma, if you go with the PC version tomorrow, check out Lucas' Simpsons Hit and Run Launcher.
[480:06.18]It has some good fixes and tweaks.
[480:08.22]I'm going to copy and paste this.
[480:13.12]Because I'm gonna be looking up stuff like that before the stream, so... Thank you, MustyFaceClaus.
[480:21.52]And I know I just said your name wrong, but I'm sorry.
[480:24.54]KXE501, thanks for the $1.50.
[480:26.53]No message, thank you, KXE.
[480:28.94]Yeah, in due time.
[480:29.68]I've had the Dreamcast for...
[480:49.42]six months now, and I still haven't found an opportunity to block out two or three straight streams to do all that.
[480:57.75]So, once that's done, kind of have to, and I got PlayStation 2.
[481:04.39]Add it to the list.
[481:07.22]I still have the Dreamcast.
[481:10.48]But thank you.
[481:12.38]Hey Casey, thanks for the $1.
[481:14.06]Here is the Fireman t-shirt link.
[481:18.14]They still, this still... I'm surprised that they still saved this.
[481:23.20]This still is here.
[481:25.98]Did they stay there forever?
[481:29.77]Interesting.
[481:30.95]I already have one.
[481:32.11]I bought one, I already got one.
[481:37.99]But thank you, Casey.
[481:38.75]Thank you, Lazy Look, for the $1.
[481:40.15]What healthy food do you recommend, Salmon?
[481:43.07]Salmon, asparagus, and like a little dollop of mashed potatoes.
[481:45.91]You'll be good to go for the rest of your life.
[481:50.34]That is the end of the bits.
[481:52.14]Here come the credits.
[481:55.82]All the new subs and old subs.
[482:00.22]Thank you guys.
[482:04.35]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[482:06.13]Probably around the same time.
[482:07.05]Probably around like 3ish PM Pacific.
[482:09.77]I did update the offline screen.
[482:17.01]Same time.
[482:18.25]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[482:19.00]We're gonna give it a go.
[482:22.36]And thanks for sticking around as long as you did tonight.
[482:25.60]I had a blast, as always.
[482:27.19]This sort of clean-up detail is just... It's just fun to play and dick around in.
[482:33.59]I was a little ill earlier.
[482:34.89]I still am, like, a little stuffy, but... I'll be fine tomorrow.
[482:37.65]I'm gonna have some vitamin juice.
[482:38.97]And we'll be good to go.
[482:48.74]Eight hours!
[482:49.42]Just over the eight-hour mark.
[482:53.15]He's taking Boomer vitamin supplements.
[482:57.97]Nah, I'm not sick or anything.
[482:58.89]I just, I don't know.
[482:59.91]Something about... I've had some like nasal issues recently.
[483:03.88]This dry, irritated kind of nose.
[483:06.76]And it might have something to do... I have a humidifier.
[483:10.84]So, I'm not sure if it has to do with the fact that it's just drying out here recently.
[483:14.04]Let's see.
[483:16.56]Vegas weather.
[483:17.38]Let's take a look at the...
[483:20.01]What have we got for humidity over there?
[483:22.43]Actually, it's really fucking humid here.
[483:24.96]Right now.
[483:26.74]It's because it's apparently raining.
[483:29.96]But the last couple of days it's been really dry.
[483:37.54]So we'll see.
[483:41.33]What the fuck are bits?
[483:43.67]It's a fake Twitch currency that translates into money.
[483:47.87]It's the best way to describe it.
[483:59.38]V-Bucks.
[484:04.46]Yeah, have a fantastic night.
[484:07.38]Catch you guys tomorrow.
[484:11.28]Will you ever think of accepting direct donations?
[484:18.24]Yeah, this really... Here's how that plays out, right?
[484:23.09]I think that is the t-shirt sales.
[484:25.39]You know what I mean?
[484:31.86]That, to me, is that.
[484:40.31]PayPal chargebacks, yeah.
[484:41.91]There's a lot of weird issues that have never really been solved, even though a lot of people say that they've been solved.
[484:56.46]How about Ethereum?
[484:57.50]That's been deleted from the bio, as you see.
[485:05.12]So I don't like to take direct donations because bits are through Twitch.
[485:11.90]Subs are through Twitch.
[485:14.20]I don't have to really worry about having to keep track of that and know, oh, wait a minute, you have to wait.
[485:18.84]That was disputed.
[485:20.34]Oh, did you just, did you use any of that money?
[485:22.18]Hold on a second here.
[485:23.30]It's been disputed.
[485:24.30]You got to give it back.
[485:24.92]You know, he's going to be careful.
[485:33.25]So I'm in a t-shirt sale.
[485:36.06]is very similar right I'd rather have something tangible something you can really hold on to bits cost more though yeah I know I know bits are more expensive than actual money
[486:07.34]It's quite a bit cheaper on our end if you enable PayPal.
[486:09.30]As long as you're careful not to spend everything right away, chargeback shouldn't be a huge issue.
[486:15.44]But also, here's another thing for tax purposes.
[486:19.73]It's... It's a lot easier for me to be able to have something from Twitch that's a tangible thing.
[486:29.41]Getting straight up monetary donations through PayPal is...
[486:37.24]I don't know, it always kind of freaks me out.
[486:40.11]Because then it's just a pot of money that, for tax purposes, looks kind of strange.
[486:52.90]But I am sorry that bits are the way that they are.
[486:58.56]If I could put feedback into Twitch partnerships, it would be something like that.
[487:05.20]The percentage I don't think has to be that high, although I don't know what the overhead is.
[487:09.09]It's just my opinion, right?
[487:22.47]Doesn't your job already look strange for tax purposes?
[487:26.19]Not so much anymore because Twitch is owned by Amazon now.
[487:30.38]So if you get tax documents from Twitch, it's Amazon.
[487:36.56]So it's not really that out of the ordinary.
[487:50.72]I work at Amazon.
[487:52.12]No, I don't.
[487:52.74]I don't.
[487:53.16]No, I don't.
[487:54.12]That's not true.
[487:57.84]But that's my time.
[487:58.64]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[488:00.16]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the dollar.
[488:01.47]Thank you, Novi, for the $3.333.
[488:03.21]That's your name.
[488:05.17]Fuck it, I'm drunk and I want the BitBadge.
[488:06.71]Thanks for all the years of laughs.
[488:08.39]Thank you.
[488:13.01]See you guys tomorrow.
[488:14.65]Get some rest.
[488:17.03]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[488:19.12]Take care, guys.
[488:20.85]Have a great night.
