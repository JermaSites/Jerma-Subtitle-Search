[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.91]I got a better idea.
[00:02.79]We're just gonna play Fistful of Frags for 20 minutes.
[00:06.00]What a fucking disaster that was.
[00:10.54]What happened?
[00:12.06]What happened?
[00:14.88]Better than Christmas games.
[00:18.42]This is the best stream ever.
[00:20.92]Well, at least we'll play.
[00:22.88]Hold on.
[00:26.32]I'm sweating down my shirt right now.
[00:28.44]It's bad.
[00:28.84]No, nobody's allowed to see.
[00:30.12]Let me see.
[00:30.74]No, nobody can see it.
[00:33.80]I've just been like, it's bad.
[00:36.46]It's bad.
[00:37.14]Look at how fucking bad that is.
[00:40.18]What?
[00:44.62]Time to put Kim on.
[00:47.85]She's right here.
[00:48.65]She heard me, like, freaking out down here.
[00:50.67]Like, screaming about, like, the screen.
[00:53.41]Alright, give me a second.
[00:55.59]Let me just get this shit set up.
[00:57.58]And we'll play Fistful of Frags for, like, ten minutes.
[01:00.54]To cool down.
[01:01.98]Hold on.
[01:47.52]Okay, hold on.
[01:53.32]Game capture.
[01:55.95]Is Etalyx still around?
[01:58.21]Etalyx, you look still around.
[01:59.19]Do you want to play Fistful of Frags for like 20 minutes?
[02:01.97]Am I even like still here?
[02:09.29]Are you still like here, Etalyx?
[02:13.10]Like, where are you?
[02:13.56]Do you wanna play Fistful of Frags?
[02:15.53]While I cry?
[02:16.09]Oh, what?
[02:25.26]What do you wanna do?
[02:31.64]I'm not even sure if you're still here.
[02:34.86]How much did you pay?
[02:36.33]You wanna do it?
[02:37.01]Okay.
[02:39.02]I think I might even still be in the TeamSpeak, am I?
[02:47.94]No.
[02:48.70]Let me go in here.
[02:50.48]Let me get in here.
[02:51.18]Yeah, we're going to play this for a little bit.
[02:56.62]Guys, I'm sorry.
[02:57.30]I'm just not doing that to people.
[02:59.76]That might have been funny for a little while and puking and eating plants and stuff, but I ain't going to do that to somebody.
[03:05.09]Hi.
[03:05.25]Hi.
[03:08.91]You're on stream, if you're here.
[03:12.91]He will be here eventually, hopefully.
[03:15.97]Hi.
[03:16.21]Hi.
[03:16.65]Yeah.
[03:18.39]Confused, because I heard you in two places at once.
[03:21.16]So, yeah, Spore, how did you like that game, Spore?
[03:26.58]Pretty fun, huh?
[03:28.26]I, to be perfectly honest, I haven't laughed that hard in a while.
[03:31.47]I was laughing pretty hard.
[03:35.13]Like, why would it do that?
[03:37.79]I was having more fun with your technical difficulties than you actually playing the game.
[03:43.89]Every time something else would go wrong, that just made it better.
[03:50.73]There were so many things in a row.
[03:54.94]I'm only going to wind down for a little bit and just play this if you want to play Fistful for a little bit.
[04:00.90]If you still have it installed.
[04:05.32]It was funny until my eyes started bleeding.
[04:07.22]I am so sorry.
[04:08.04]I got to change the name of the title too.
[04:14.11]Wind down whiskey.
[04:18.35]No, that means I'm like drinking whiskey on stream.
[04:21.99]He's like, oh, I'm just going to wind down whiskey.
[04:26.15]Wind down.
[04:26.97]Wind down.
[04:27.93]I don't even care at this point.
[04:31.55]We're beyond that.
[04:36.60]Fistful of Frags.
[04:39.20]Let me just make sure people don't come to the stream looking for spore.
[04:44.61]So, the server.
[04:47.13]I'll just send it to you before I go on a new one.
[04:49.89]Oh, no.
[04:50.21]Apparently, Kim exposed me on stream.
[04:52.61]Everyone found out my first name.
[04:55.43]The name that I started 100% of my videos with for like two and a half years.
[05:01.52]No, you got exposed, dude.
[05:04.71]Any video from, like, 2011 to 12.
[05:06.67]Alright, good.
[05:08.23]So I thought you, like, still cared about that.
[05:09.93]You know, he doesn't even care.
[05:11.07]Who cares?
[05:11.45]Okay, sorry about that, though.
[05:12.95]Alright, let me get you a spore.
[05:17.82]Everyone's asking for spore again.
[05:19.02]No.
[05:19.18]No more spore.
[05:23.86]My real name, very few people know.
[05:26.58]Italy X.
[05:29.42]Yeah, Italy is his actual name.
[05:31.96]Let me give you this.
[05:34.18]History... You actually probably can still get in here.
[05:37.96]Yeah, you can still get in this one.
[05:38.92]This one is still very much available.
[05:43.14]But you gotta go soon!
[05:46.16]I'll put it in this little chat here.
[05:48.05]There you go.
[05:48.97]That's the server I'm in.
[05:50.35]It is a free-for-all italic, so, you know, good luck.
[05:55.09]Okay, I will be done downloading it in a minute.
[05:58.47]Oh, you're not done downloading it?
[06:02.03]It'll be there shortly.
[06:03.69]We're going at almost 20 megabytes per second.
[06:07.39]Am I ever going to play Spore?
[06:08.72]I was thinking about it.
[06:09.32]I'm not sure.
[06:12.18]I missed those.
[06:12.66]Where am I missing those?
[06:16.70]It's where I'm sitting in the chair.
[06:18.92]I'm going to move my chair down.
[06:25.84]Oh, by the way, I was laughing the hardest every time the screen would flash with epileptic flashes.
[06:30.90]Really?
[06:32.02]That was when I laughed the hardest.
[06:35.91]It wasn't happening on my screen.
[06:36.81]It's because it was always happening.
[06:39.23]Like, that shit wasn't happening on my screen.
[06:42.61]I was in the color changer for like five straight minutes, and it was happening the whole time.
[06:46.86]I had no idea.
[06:50.85]Should I play Nier?
[06:52.60]Is Nier good?
[06:54.40]You don't think about Nier attacks?
[06:57.32]I do.
[06:57.88]I played the demo.
[06:58.70]I thought it was good, but I don't know if you would like it personally.
[07:04.84]I just want this one.
[07:05.84]Please.
[07:07.50]It's like a weird hybrid of shoot-em-up.
[07:11.32]Like shmup.
[07:13.56]And...
[07:16.45]I don't know how to describe it.
[07:17.57]Just the brawler aspect of it, you know?
[07:19.57]Like the... Is it?
[07:21.24]Kind of Dynasty Warriors.
[07:22.64]Not Dynasty Warriors where you kill a bunch of people, but like that kind of combat where you just have these big sweeping combo attacks that you chain together.
[07:32.44]But it's fun.
[07:33.98]I thought it was fun, but sometimes the camera can be kind of frustrating.
[07:37.68]Yeah.
[07:38.10]Like, because it changes the camera frequently.
[07:41.94]Sometimes it's like top-down view.
[07:44.22]Now it's isometric.
[07:46.33]Now you're literally a plane.
[07:48.53]Did you play Nioh?
[07:51.67]No, I did not.
[07:53.03]The Dark Souls-esque.
[07:55.25]Yeah.
[07:55.69]I want to go back to Nioh, but I feel like I can't.
[07:59.23]I thought you didn't like it.
[08:01.19]I didn't, but I did.
[08:02.21]I feel like if I just gave it time and actually, like, watched it and cared about it.
[08:07.43]Like, if I watched, like, what to do and where to go.
[08:09.43]Because I was, like, shit-faced playing that game.
[08:11.77]I drank, like, a bunch of whiskey on that stream.
[08:18.42]Ow.
[08:21.18]Good old Source Engine.
[08:23.31]I don't know when the last time I played a Source Engine game was.
[08:25.49]Uh, how long ago?
[08:28.49]Years?
[08:28.99]Months?
[08:29.81]Probably the last time I played Fistful of Frags.
[08:32.91]Probably years.
[08:35.64]I should try Nioh again.
[08:36.64]I probably will.
[08:38.94]I don't know.
[08:41.42]I gotta get some... Dude, like, plans... This week has been the week of disaster streams.
[08:48.37]It really has.
[08:48.77]The first part of this stream was pretty good, though, I thought.
[08:52.47]Yeah, like, you and I playing Bloody Trapland was great.
[08:56.33]It was fun.
[08:57.01]I was having a good time.
[08:57.85]It was fun.
[08:58.33]It was frustrating.
[08:58.85]It was fun.
[08:59.25]It was cool to play a game with you.
[09:01.46]But for some reason, I've had such weird, fucked-up, strange luck with video games on stream.
[09:08.86]I could have, like, played Spore on stream for, like, a couple hours.
[09:11.38]Nope.
[09:13.00]Ain't gonna happen.
[09:19.55]Shit.
[09:25.25]Ain't gonna hide from me.
[09:26.29]Yeah, I'm pretty much rolling.
[09:31.89]Rolling bad the last like three straight streams in a row.
[09:37.59]It happens to the best of us, you know?
[09:39.08]You just can't... Some things are just beyond your control.
[09:41.22]That was my fault.
[09:42.02]Hey, how was the spore epilepsy filter my fault?
[09:46.64]How am I supposed to control that?
[09:47.72]I can't do anything about that.
[09:52.02]I can't be blamed for that.
[09:53.05]That's just how it's captured through OBS.
[09:57.33]What?
[09:58.51]How did I not... Spore is a game that doesn't like to be streamed.
[10:04.29]Apparently not.
[10:06.43]What's the button to change your loadout?
[10:09.23]Uh, B. In fact, thanks for reminding me, because I'm going to change mine.
[10:17.09]ColdAB.
[10:19.09]Alright, you're in here, right?
[10:20.61]I am now in here, yes.
[10:22.07]Very good.
[10:24.82]What's the best weapon in the game?
[10:26.48]The games were bad, but the streams were still good.
[10:28.48]Well, at least, I hope that's the case.
[10:33.09]I think, you know, the level of, like, comedy there for me, like, the joke there for me, was how everybody was begging me to play that game.
[10:41.33]Everyone's like, play Spore.
[10:42.37]You gotta play Spore.
[10:42.95]Yeah, play Spore, play Spore, play.
[10:44.51]And I finally play it, finally, after, like, a week of talking about it.
[10:47.87]And it was a disaster.
[10:50.34]Like, I find that to be actually pretty funny.
[10:52.22]So, it was worth it.
[10:53.62]Definitely worth it to me.
[10:55.52]Now, I'm gonna try to get this gold chest.
[10:57.26]I'm gonna be the first guy in here.
[11:00.26]No, I'm not.
[11:00.60]That was a warm-up round.
[11:04.45]I wish we were on the same team as Alex, but you know.
[11:07.61]Isn't this a free-for-all?
[11:08.57]Yeah, it's a free-for-all.
[11:09.73]Well, then maybe you shouldn't join a free-for-all.
[11:12.33]This was one of the only ones that had players that was an official server.
[11:16.82]There's only, like, one server worth of people?
[11:21.46]No, there's still people playing, but... Custom, uh... This guy does not... That guy just had his head planted up.
[11:32.03]What's the button for, like, throwable things?
[11:35.79]What'd you say?
[11:37.31]Like, dynamite.
[11:38.98]Is there a hotkey or do you have to switch to it?
[11:43.44]I don't know.
[11:43.80]I thought you were the Fistful of Frags master.
[11:49.48]You have to set it yourself in the settings there.
[11:55.97]Why have I... Can I not... Get off the stupid derringer.
[12:01.23]Who wants a derringer?
[12:04.63]Figure it out yourself.
[12:10.64]Would you do Don't Starve?
[12:12.06]I was reading the same comment.
[12:13.27]You would hate that game.
[12:15.49]You would absolutely hate Don't Starve together.
[12:18.15]I think you did.
[12:18.61]You like showed me.
[12:19.25]Guaranteed.
[12:25.19]It's going to be one of those cases of you don't like gathering resources.
[12:30.82]The end.
[12:33.78]Did I do that?
[12:34.42]I don't know.
[12:35.70]Gathering resources, the video game.
[12:37.96]That's pretty much what it is.
[12:46.25]Don't starve together.
[12:49.01]I'm not really into games like that.
[12:52.97]Not necessarily.
[12:57.22]Those games are fun on like an iPad, I think.
[12:59.44]I have my most fun lying down just chilling in bed playing those games.
[13:13.95]Damn it.
[13:19.27]Oh, dang it.
[13:25.11]That was my kill.
[13:27.28]What's the kick button?
[13:29.46]Shift.
[13:30.84]I believe it is shift by default.
[13:32.16]Of course it is.
[13:34.46]And alt is also up to walk.
[13:39.38]What?
[13:40.44]Which gives you better aiming capabilities.
[13:54.27]Alright, so... We should probably get on... Let's get on a team server and play, like, play on a team.
[13:59.11]Yeah, that sounds more fun.
[14:00.19]There's not much to talk about when it's free-for-all.
[14:02.24]I can't be like, that guy shouldn't have got me.
[14:05.88]Got him.
[14:07.16]Alright.
[14:08.38]Just go to your... I'll just put it in, even if people see.
[14:11.18]Whatever.
[14:11.96]Two-team shootout.
[14:12.82]There's nobody even in here.
[14:14.51]Go here, guys.
[14:15.09]If you want to play Fistful of Frags, we'll just play this one out.
[14:18.45]Oh, wait, what?
[14:19.75]I'm sending it to you in the speak of the team.
[14:23.33]Mm-hmm.
[14:24.57]There it is.
[14:25.59]Go there.
[14:26.07]And we'll play around here.
[14:29.59]And if you can join the Desperados, I would say you should.
[14:33.60]Because that's the team that I'm going to be playing.
[14:37.52]Desperado.
[14:38.26]Is that a red chest?
[14:44.82]I'm an expert at accidentally dying in games.
[14:50.22]That guy just freaked me out so bad that I couldn't even hit him.
[14:52.48]Nobody can hit this guy, apparently.
[14:55.20]Nobody hit him.
[14:56.88]We did a great job as a team there.
[15:00.00]TeamSpeak?
[15:01.20]Laughing about TeamSpeak?
[15:02.26]Well, this is like an old... This is an old, old school TeamSpeak.
[15:05.63]I still think it's... It's still the best.
[15:10.11]I like it.
[15:12.71]Discord is good, but Discord, I think the call quality is better on TeamSpeak.
[15:18.41]Discord is really, really cool.
[15:21.05]And it's super awesome for, like, a centralized, like, app.
[15:24.07]But... It's... Eh... You know.
[15:30.94]Yeah.
[15:32.96]It doesn't function as a chat room, but... It does one thing, and it does it really well.
[15:38.06]Play the Spore DLC.
[15:40.02]Does the Spore DLC come with a, like... Not going to hurt people's eyes if I play it?
[15:47.37]Oh, his friend came over there.
[15:50.61]Did you get in here?
[15:52.13]I am on your team, yes.
[15:53.83]What's your name?
[15:56.17]You know, Etalyx, you might have heard of me.
[15:57.98]Oh, you just grayed out.
[15:58.80]I don't know why I couldn't even see you.
[15:59.84]Alright, Etalyx, we have 16 minutes.
[16:03.66]We have 16 minutes to win this game.
[16:04.94]Alright.
[16:07.98]Is there actually a timer, or is that your timer?
[16:10.45]In the top 16 minutes.
[16:11.67]Yeah, I got switched.
[16:13.71]That's what's driving me crazy.
[16:15.27]I got on a different team.
[16:20.57]Spore DLC actually fixes the... It doesn't really.
[16:24.19]That's so funny if that's the case.
[16:28.07]It actually fixes that problem.
[16:34.27]I want my skill field.
[16:35.21]I don't know why I'm using this.
[16:41.05]Now I'm ready to play.
[16:51.85]Uh, are we even on the same team talks?
[16:54.12]Uh, I joined the desperados as instructed.
[16:56.54]Yeah, I got auto-switched.
[16:59.01]Oh.
[16:59.39]Well, then no, we are not on the same team.
[17:01.95]Oh, well.
[17:07.69]Can I change?
[17:08.17]No.
[17:08.51]Can't this streamer do anything right?
[17:11.85]No, because every single thing has to go wrong when I play a game on stream.
[17:15.13]Don't you know that?
[17:18.04]That's just the way it is.
[17:18.86]Like, every possible thing that could, like, go bad has to go bad.
[17:22.72]Yeah.
[17:23.26]Every time.
[17:25.92]And now I'm rubberbanding.
[17:28.18]That's not a good sign.
[17:31.66]That's an internet issue.
[17:32.66]Uh-oh.
[17:32.90]Turn that bitrate down.
[17:34.46]No, not really.
[17:40.71]It actually brings me back.
[17:42.11]I miss when this game was like new.
[17:44.29]Yeah, it was awesome.
[17:54.70]What do I have for a ping?
[17:56.26]Is it something terrible or what's going on here?
[17:58.93]Now I have 44 ping.
[17:59.89]Why do I feel like shitty?
[18:01.91]Why do I feel like I'm moving around too much?
[18:13.67]Every single time.
[18:20.11]If I tried doing sport with C-Dog in the background.
[18:22.82]I'm trying just to not be angry at this last hour of streaming.
[18:26.88]Is what I'm trying to do.
[18:28.30]I hope it at least was funny.
[18:35.91]34 ping, unplayable.
[18:36.81]I know, really.
[18:44.61]GTA Vice City, I would actually play that.
[18:48.29]Like a remake?
[18:50.29]Or like the actual game?
[18:52.86]I would play like the actual game.
[18:59.26]Well, what's stopping you?
[19:04.73]Is Vice City even on PC?
[19:08.35]I think it is.
[19:09.17]I know it's on like iPad, but is it on like Steam?
[19:14.99]I know it's on iPad.
[19:17.33]San Andreas is on iOS.
[19:18.85]Is it on Steam yet?
[19:21.01]Wait, San Andreas is on iPad.
[19:23.19]I have it on iPad.
[19:26.26]We would chill and play some Vice City.
[19:30.15]At that point, maybe I would just play GTA 4.
[19:31.46]Because that's like... I find that to be probably the most fun one I've ever played.
[19:36.26]Cousin.
[19:36.88]Cousin.
[19:38.48]Stream the iPad version.
[19:39.66]Oh god, just kill him.
[19:45.43]I'm being a distraction.
[19:46.19]I'm being such an annoying distraction.
[19:49.19]Alright, what'd he drop?
[19:50.45]I need a gun.
[19:51.77]Whatever it is.
[19:52.27]Oh, he died.
[19:55.75]Good.
[19:56.66]Now play the piano.
[20:02.34]Grab that auto various times.
[20:08.38]Remember when GTA 5 came out and I bought it on three separate platforms?
[20:18.76]I do.
[20:20.35]I remember buying GTA 4.
[20:23.85]I gave Rockstar... You and I both gave Rockstar like...
[20:27.15]I gave him $180.
[20:27.45]Like $180.
[20:27.61]Just for the games.
[20:28.44]Not for like online DLC.
[20:30.60]Just to play the game.
[20:31.52]Uh-huh.
[20:39.90]How do you quick fan?
[20:41.52]Hold down right mouse and shoot.
[20:46.10]They just significantly upped the recoil since the last time I played.
[20:49.42]Also, if you hit Q, you will put the gun in your left hand.
[20:54.40]The gun is more accurate in your left hand while walking.
[20:57.84]Fanning is better in your right hand.
[21:00.02]So if you want to just singly solo shot people, you want to use the left-handed mode, which is Q.
[21:08.88]Wait, left hand's more accurate?
[21:10.52]Left hand is more accurate.
[21:12.14]Alright, Q does not switch hands.
[21:13.36]It just pulls out the knife.
[21:14.15]Q for me is switching hands.
[21:21.47]Why pay so much?
[21:22.27]Because it can't... Because remember when they added... First of all, it was 30 FPS on PS3.
[21:28.25]Yes, we got it on PS3, then we got it on PS4, and they finally released it on PC.
[21:33.48]And there were subtle improvements with each one.
[21:36.40]And not only that, the first-person mode, it was still 30 FPS on console, but when they added the first-person mode, that was a big deal.
[21:45.30]We wanted to see that, because it wasn't on PC initially, right?
[21:48.73]It was patched in later or something.
[21:51.63]It wasn't even available on PC until like much later.
[21:53.75]I don't remember.
[21:59.18]Check out the Metro games.
[22:01.06]You're a fan of those games, aren't you?
[22:03.24]Of what?
[22:04.00]Metro games.
[22:05.92]Oh, yeah.
[22:06.40]Metro 2033 and Last Light.
[22:08.22]They're actually really good games.
[22:10.61]You guys see what I'm talking about here, right?
[22:12.11]Like people are just rubber banding all over the place.
[22:17.19]Is that a me issue, I wonder?
[22:18.69]It kind of feels like it is.
[22:19.71]Hold on, am I dropping frames or anything?
[22:25.00]No.
[22:26.20]I'm not dropping any frames.
[22:35.04]Last Light was a really good game.
[22:36.14]I'm looking forward to the next one.
[22:38.22]What's the next one?
[22:39.98]I think the guy wrote another book so that they could make another game about it.
[22:45.89]He wrote the book just to make the game.
[22:49.18]You know, honestly, he probably did make more money on the games than he did on the books.
[22:54.83]Probably.
[22:55.23]I don't know.
[22:56.18]Maybe.
[23:00.24]kind of like our oh that's what I was going to bring up earlier to uh um speaking of books yeah I think it was like yesterday or sometime recently is marks the new longest period between song of ice and fire books really yeah so like the distance between feast for crows and dance with dragons has now been exceeded so that book is never coming out when's when's the winner is just never coming out
[23:26.72]Dude, uh, George R. R. Martin fell asleep at his desk four years ago.
[23:30.84]And he, like, he, so nobody went and woke him up yet.
[23:33.56]He's gonna, he's gonna just, like, rip his head up and be like, He's just been asleep the whole time.
[23:37.72]He's been asleep at his desk.
[23:39.24]Yeah.
[23:40.10]Someone's gonna walk in his room, put their hand on his shoulder, and he's gonna, like, What happened?
[23:44.98]And he's gonna, and guess what?
[23:45.86]He only has, like, four pages written.
[23:49.29]You know what I mean?
[23:49.85]He's gonna, it's, it's, it's... George R. R. Martin doesn't care anymore.
[23:56.33]Where's my book?
[23:58.05]We're not talking about my book.
[23:59.15]We're talking about George R. R. Martin's book.
[24:04.92]And he's gonna be really skinny.
[24:06.94]Remember how sure we were like two years ago?
[24:09.70]Oh yeah, it'll definitely be out by next year.
[24:11.72]And that was like last year?
[24:12.78]Yeah.
[24:14.03]I remember an extensive conversation you and I had talking about how that book, not only is it going to be out in like less than a year, but that we were sure that the show... That it was going to beat the last season that just came on.
[24:28.16]We were positive.
[24:31.80]Then, I don't know, playing Fistful of Frags.
[24:34.16]There was no way that it could ever be taken.
[24:37.26]He would never let them just overtake him.
[24:39.42]I'm not sure why everyone's shaking around so much on my screen.
[24:43.69]See, it's a me thing.
[24:45.99]See, it's like... It's kind of causing me some anguish at the moment.
[24:52.91]Oh, he's writing spore fanfiction.
[24:56.30]He got stuck on a level in Bloody Trapling.
[25:00.38]He was watching the stream like an hour ago.
[25:03.60]And he was just like, what is this?
[25:04.88]What is this disgusting imagery?
[25:06.35]I don't even want to see this.
[25:08.97]And it gave him a headache and he cancelled the book.
[25:13.78]Sorry guys, I canceled the Winds of Winter because I gave George R. R. Martin a headache like 30 minutes ago.
[25:22.37]Anguish.
[25:25.87]He's playing Spore.
[25:32.51]He's just been playing Spore for five years.
[25:36.67]He's like, look at all these creatures I've made.
[25:40.03]The thing is, with the Winds of Winter, I decided to go a slightly different route.
[25:46.51]I wanted to make some monsters in it.
[25:48.31]And it shows the imagery and pictures from the book.
[25:50.91]And it literally is just Spore monsters.
[25:54.97]I've been really into this new video game that came out nine years ago.
[25:59.03]It's Spore.
[26:01.97]And by the way...
[26:07.97]I was playing this bloody Trapland game and it was really fun.
[26:12.23]Why is he just me?
[26:13.66]I don't understand.
[26:14.22]Like, why am I taking over his life?
[26:17.42]Winds of Spore.
[26:20.32]What is that voice?
[26:21.12]That's George R.R.
[26:21.78]Martin.
[26:23.04]That's the George R.R.
[26:23.92]Martin voice.
[26:26.08]I haven't heard that one in a long time.
[26:29.41]And he laughs like that.
[26:32.99]And you see when Tyrion goes down into the well and he falls through.
[26:39.79]It's pretty good.
[26:43.59]You don't believe me?
[26:44.29]Go look up George R. R. Martin laugh on YouTube.
[26:49.22]That's exactly what it is.
[26:50.50]I promise you.
[26:51.02]There's a compilation of him laughing on YouTube because it's crazy.
[26:58.08]Spore RR Martin.
[26:59.62]Spore RR Martin.
[27:00.76]I love it.
[27:03.02]Spore RR Martin.
[27:03.76]Why am I lagging fucking all over the place?
[27:05.86]This is horrible.
[27:09.02]Alright, now we're gonna go ham.
[27:11.00]Oh, no, please, please.
[27:12.88]Let me go ham.
[27:13.76]Please.
[27:15.35]Ham sandwich.
[27:17.37]Extra dairy.
[27:18.69]Stop rubber banding me.
[27:19.41]I'm getting a little bit of the rubber banding too, actually.
[27:21.63]Yeah?
[27:21.83]It's not just you.
[27:22.71]It's not just me?
[27:30.96]Come on.
[27:32.60]I got a walker.
[27:39.23]I got a walker.
[27:42.59]Yeah, extra dairy.
[27:43.37]You guys know.
[27:46.19]By the way, guys, stay away from dairy.
[27:48.65]Just don't eat... No more cheese for anyone in this chat.
[27:52.82]Uh... About that.
[27:56.76]No more cheese.
[27:58.72]I'm afraid I cannot oblige with no more dairy.
[28:02.50]I've got a milkshake.
[28:04.02]You're drinking a milkshake right now?
[28:04.90]Right now.
[28:05.12]Dump it up.
[28:06.20]No.
[28:07.10]It's actually a malt.
[28:08.65]Really?
[28:08.87]It's a chocolate malt.
[28:11.23]It's delicious.
[28:13.43]Etalyx, I don't know.
[28:14.15]I think you're gonna have to dump that up.
[28:22.15]Don't tell me what to eat.
[28:23.67]You guys should only be eating raw broccoli and water.
[28:30.43]That's that would be a gross diet for like ever you guys should only be eating Like unpeeled carrots, that's it.
[28:38.93]What's wrong with the peel?
[28:42.65]I Said what's wrong with carrot peel you eat the carrot peel.
[28:47.05]I mean if I if I cut up little carrots.
[28:48.70]Yeah What Are you sure you're okay with that?
[28:55.75]It's not like I'm eating the banana peel.
[28:58.83]Wait, you don't eat the banana peel.
[29:01.79]I always thought you just bit into the banana.
[29:05.29]And these guys are all just freaking me out.
[29:07.13]I had a fucking walker and I'm sitting there just being a dickhead.
[29:15.01]I haven't done anything.
[29:21.28]As someone who literally never eats vegetables, carrots have peels.
[29:24.04]Yeah, they have like a skin.
[29:26.07]You rip them off with a little peeler.
[29:28.05]I was drinking banana milk.
[29:32.17]I was.
[29:34.88]Wait, why is that such a weird thing to you guys?
[29:36.32]Peeling carrots?
[29:37.52]Do I eat eggshells?
[29:38.82]Of course I do.
[29:42.52]I buy eggs from the carton.
[29:44.52]I pick them out of the carton and just put them in my mouth and crunch.
[29:46.40]I thought that's how you're supposed to eat them.
[29:49.04]What are you talking about?
[29:50.42]How do you eat your eggs?
[29:53.43]Depends on whether or not I have any milk.
[29:57.39]What the hell are you talking about?
[30:00.77]Well, I mean, first you boil milk.
[30:03.85]Right?
[30:04.17]Yeah.
[30:06.13]Then I thought you put the eggs in the boiling milk and shake them.
[30:11.60]Yeah.
[30:12.46]I mean, I would do it like that, or I would just crack it into my mouth.
[30:18.21]It's more protein that way, but... Not sure how I feel about the texture.
[30:25.79]You know, actually, eggshells...
[30:30.72]You know if you don't take the eggshells off and you boil it in water, you boil the egg in water, you get something called a hard-boiled egg.
[30:41.13]You ever have one?
[30:44.15]Only with milk.
[30:44.85]Leave those shells on, though, dude.
[30:46.53]Don't take them off.
[30:48.77]Have you guys ever heard of that before?
[30:50.64]You guys in chat, have you guys heard of a hard-boiled egg?
[30:52.58]It's weird.
[30:52.98]It's cool, huh?
[30:58.94]Have we gotten this bored that we're just talking about nonsense, eating fucking egg?
[31:04.36]I don't even know what we've been talking about.
[31:08.23]I have no idea.
[31:09.21]I was so defeated from this last hour and a half of this stream.
[31:15.65]What the fuck was that?
[31:16.82]There was nothing there.
[31:22.00]There was absolutely nothing there.
[31:24.69]Hey, you were going there.
[31:27.37]You started it.
[31:28.59]I wasn't even making a joke.
[31:29.57]I was just talking.
[31:30.21]I was just saying words that were just coming out of my mouth.
[31:31.82]I didn't even know what they were.
[31:32.76]Yeah, I was just trying, just in case you, like, had a joke, I didn't want to be like, what are you talking about, Jeremiah?
[31:38.14]You're just saying nonsense.
[31:39.50]You should have just spun me around with a blindfold on and put me with a fucking donkey tail and told me to go put it there.
[31:44.20]You can't always be the straight man.
[31:45.85]Sometimes you just gotta, like, let it go, you know?
[31:47.71]That's what I was doing.
[31:48.49]Sometimes you gotta, like...
[31:51.05]sometimes you gotta just get defeated and speaking of defeated not right now though through the window nobody likes a straight man 100 of the time you know okay even with the uh like shaking nonsense alright Etalyx you have 40 seconds to make everybody laugh in my chat hurry up 40 seconds I can't
[32:15.26]I can't do it.
[32:15.78]It's an impossible task.
[32:17.28]If you do it, then... In 30 seconds, if you can make every... And it has to be everybody.
[32:22.85]Every single person has to laugh.
[32:26.39]You know I get I think maybe you could get a Maybe I'll buy you like a steam game Okay, like what would you say?
[32:35.88]He's like a steam game.
[32:36.66]That's why what are you like?
[32:37.80]What are you?

[32:52.94]Thank you for playing.
[32:54.15]Okay.
[32:55.23]All I see is everyone in chat drawing ha-ha.
[32:57.99]So, I think I actually won.
[32:59.97]You did a good job.
[33:03.18]Oh, my God.
[33:03.82]Do you remember with the laugh assist?
[33:07.61]No, this is Jervis defeated.

[33:16.00]I'm going to the blackboard and I'm gonna like write a bunch of- I'm gonna fucking make a game plan for tomorrow.
[33:22.14]We're making a game plan next week.
[33:25.90]I have a schedule.
[33:26.94]I ain't gonna fucking have three goddamn streams in a row.
[33:31.07]Where like shit just goes wrong.
[33:34.18]But, you know, buying Portal 2.
[33:37.10]Doesn't everybody has Portal 2?
[33:39.82]You can't, like, own Steam without owning Portal 2.
[33:42.05]Isn't that, like, a law?
[33:47.25]You defeated.
[33:49.73]Rethink your strategy.
[33:50.92]Yeah, you know, like, when the New York Jets, like, got to the Super Bowl that year and they had to change their game plan because the Patriots was so much better than them?
[34:01.24]They ended up winning that game because they changed their strategy.
[34:04.56]And Bill Belichick's just a way better coach than Rex Ryan ever was.
[34:12.73]Go play Cookie Clicker.
[34:14.61]No, I'm going to take off.
[34:16.53]Etalyx, thank you again for playing.
[34:18.87]I just needed a game to chill so I wouldn't lose my mind.
[34:20.97]It was a fun trip down memory lane with the frags and the fists.
[34:25.85]I will play this again.
[34:27.86]We should play this again and actually go for it and stream it for real.
[34:37.14]But, thank you everybody for watching.
