[00:01.40]Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02.44]Good afternoon.
[00:04.34]How are you?
[00:08.14]Good.
[00:08.96]I'm doing good.
[00:10.30]I'm doing okay.
[00:13.80]Got some good news for those of you that were at the stream yesterday into today.
[00:20.20]Memory card works.
[00:21.85]I got a new one.
[00:26.20]Chibi-Robo is a go.
[00:29.76]No corruption.
[00:30.92]No reformatting necessary.
[00:33.40]We're good to go.
[00:36.78]Already tested it.
[00:38.06]I played through the first part of Chibi-Robo to make sure I could save the... Not gonna swear yet.
[00:45.11]Make sure I could save the darn game.
[00:49.99]And I can.
[00:52.01]So we're good to go.
[00:54.82]If you missed the tutorial, just watch the rage-filled first 40 minutes of yesterday's stream and you'll see it.
[01:02.76]I'll give you a quick rundown.
[01:04.82]It's Ribbit Girl's birthday.
[01:08.40]Happy birthday.
[01:09.46]And we have to make the family happy.
[01:11.20]That's it.
[01:13.75]Did you make the ghost leave?
[01:16.53]I've been burning incense in my room all day.
[01:21.05]I keep hearing this faint screaming coming from the corners of the room.
[01:26.84]Alright, I got- it says time in here now.
[01:29.24]Good luck.
[01:30.02]I got time incense around the whole room.
[01:32.74]Good luck!
[01:36.77]I made a couple of phone calls.
[01:37.93]Bugleberry told me that that was the best thing to do.
[01:40.67]Sprinkle time in the corners of your room and wear a garlic necklace.
[01:44.99]And the memory card works, so I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
[01:55.12]Where's the real Jerma?
[02:00.63]Show us the necklace.
[02:01.99]Well, the thing is, it was a garlic necklace, and I love that stuff.
[02:06.71]After a few hours of sitting here, waiting, meditating, I had a little bit of a smack.
[02:13.85]Can't help myself.
[02:19.21]Vampire Hunter.
[02:21.09]Yeah, Chibi-Robo, I'm so excited.
[02:24.23]Now I can actually enjoy the game for what it's supposed to be.
[02:29.96]That poor garlic.
[02:33.34]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[02:36.69]Here it is.
[02:41.13]You want to see?
[02:41.91]Would you guys like to see?
[02:43.31]Check this out.
[02:43.87]Ready?
[02:45.35]Let's plug it in and just make sure that this works.
[02:48.89]Just plug.
[02:51.85]Okay.
[02:54.05]We have to gain Chibi ranking again.
[02:56.16]It's okay.
[02:58.50]60 more happy points.
[02:59.36]While you're here, Chibi Rebel, would you like to save?
[03:02.52]I would love to.
[03:04.32]And look at that.
[03:10.33]Now saving.
[03:11.99]No corrupted memory.
[03:14.35]I'm so happy.
[03:18.75]Please reformat.
[03:21.03]Don't say that shit.
[03:25.16]Did you slam your memory card into the door?
[03:30.02]Fuck that thing.
[03:34.96]I really thought it was going to work yesterday.
[03:36.56]Alright, I'm ready.
[03:38.38]So the whole goal, I know a lot of you have been waiting for this, so have I. The goal is to make everybody happy in the house.
[03:43.64]You do chores.
[03:46.30]And I'm going to go do them.
[03:47.74]You pick up trash.
[03:49.67]You do laundry.
[03:51.13]It's like my... It could be my favorite game ever made.
[03:53.91]Alright, let's go.
[03:58.09]What?
[04:06.21]Why is Chibi-Robo gonna make you depressed?
[04:15.46]He's emulating.
[04:16.32]Cut the stream.
[04:17.06]I'm not.
[04:17.82]Yeah, dad had a lot of fun at the birthday party.
[04:20.94]Again, this was a birthday party that we were at.
[04:23.28]Yeah, sun symbol during the day, moon symbol at night.
[04:25.98]The moon is out right now.
[04:26.72]That means it's nighttime, of course.
[04:35.30]Alright, let's get happy points.
[04:37.56]Time to clean the li- Alright, we did this stuff before, but I'm gonna do it again.
[04:43.21]Popper trash.
[04:47.43]We're gonna throw this stuff in the recycling bin.
[04:50.19]Or in the trash can.
[04:52.61]Show the new memory card.
[04:53.76]Nope, I'm not touching it.
[04:56.16]I'm going to pour cement into this hole where it's plugged in.
[05:00.52]This is never coming up.
[05:02.02]Ever again.
[05:06.60]Oh, we saw this yesterday.
[05:07.92]Dear diary.
[05:08.56]Yeah, we were looking at the diary.
[05:13.92]It's not gonna work again.
[05:14.94]I'm gonna put super blue in that hole.
[05:21.56]Now, but tonight he was lazy and I can watch Drake while he patrols.
[05:25.95]It's so hard to watch him, that knight in shining armor.
[05:31.37]How will you poop?
[05:35.84]I said I'm gonna pour cement into the- Oh.
[05:44.29]Okay.
[05:45.75]You heard that wrong.
[05:48.10]Dude, I saw something actually so funny today.
[05:50.26]Like, this is not a connection to that, but I had to tell this story.
[05:54.27]So I'm out doing errands.
[05:57.01]And I'm getting shit done.
[05:58.77]And I pull up, and the thing about living in Vegas is there's tons of crazy shit that happens all the time in Vegas, right?
[06:05.40]So there's a big intersection.
[06:06.56]Huge intersection.
[06:08.14]probably at least a hundred cars on all sides of the intersection and on the corner of the intersection is a guy in a frog costume dancing around with a sign which that's not completely out of the ordinary he's just doing all these crazy moves he's like like lunging forward lunging forward spin spin spin point point at that car point at that car
[06:29.77]point at that car right and that's there's nothing it's not like oh well that's hilarious or anything right but like for 200 feet down from this guy there's a bus stop and the people at this bus stop were fucking furious with this guy all of them had this face they were all just so angry like what the fuck is this guy doing I'm just sitting there going this is
[06:57.12]I mean, can you really be mad at the dancing frog guy?
[07:01.17]Like, come on.
[07:04.21]And I'm sitting there thinking... Because this is at a red light.
[07:08.97]If people start to go after the frog guy, I... I gotta get out and I gotta... I would pull over.
[07:13.81]And I'd get out and I would defend the frog guy.
[07:16.67]You know what I mean?
[07:18.81]I don't know.
[07:19.21]I don't know why they were so angry with him.
[07:23.13]He was giving it his all.
[07:24.79]He was dancing so hard.
[07:26.07]He was doing so many moves.
[07:27.99]And this whole... I'm talking all the people at this bus stop.
[07:30.43]It wasn't just one person.
[07:32.09]They're all just staring at him with this face.
[07:34.43]Like this.
[07:34.75]Well, not like that, but like this.
[07:37.07]I'm just saying, what the fuck?
[07:42.41]And they can, like, fight this guy because he's dancing?
[07:45.17]Like a sail?
[07:47.43]Star Wars!
[07:52.18]That's your resting face.
[07:57.65]It was ridiculous.
[08:04.31]I'm just sitting there going, why is this happening?
[08:07.03]Alright, we did this yesterday.
[08:08.59]We got some big bits too.
[08:09.71]We just got like $50.
[08:10.33]Hold on.
[08:10.57]They all have resting mad frog face.
[08:22.64]I want a free shirt.
[08:23.84]Is today the last wink day?
[08:25.14]No, not today.
[08:25.98]It's coming up soon, though.
[08:30.44]Where's the wink discount?
[08:32.44]It's not today.
[08:33.10]It's not today.
[08:36.19]Alright.
[08:39.83]Passionate love for Drake Redcrest.
[08:41.59]It's fine.
[08:42.03]The discount is gonna be 67k.
[08:45.03]That'd be funny.
[08:52.77]I did fix the memory card issue.
[08:54.31]We're good to go.
[08:54.87]We're just trying to get to the point where I was at last night.
[08:57.72]Or yesterday afternoon.
[08:58.52]Which is pretty much, like, right here.
[09:03.40]After the diary part is when I started to go, guys, you know what?
[09:06.28]Ugh, you know, you know what?
[09:08.20]No, I can't, ugh, I'm gonna have to, we're gonna have to pivot, right?
[09:10.99]That's kind of when this happened.
[09:17.57]Alright, but hold on, we had huge money coming.
[09:19.41]We had 5,000 bits coming from Bitslave.
[09:22.94]Thanks for the $50, Bitslave.
[09:24.54]They say, Hey Jerma, I want to thank you again for taking a couple days off streaming just to play League of Legends with me.
[09:28.78]This didn't happen.
[09:29.86]I had a lot of fun yesterday when we had that whole bottle of Johnny Walker and we were just running it down mid.
[09:34.61]Thought my account was going to get banned again, laughing my ass off.
[09:37.95]Anyways, I can rest easy now that you've played League.
[09:41.05]No sense denying it now, chat knows the truth, just come clean.
[09:43.99]Also, sorry for calling you a boomer the other day.
[09:48.65]Dude, we gotta get you in another game.
[09:51.63]Can I interest you in a GameCube?
[09:53.03]Alright, you can climb wires here.
[10:05.62]Dude, I love the GameCube.
[10:09.64]Thanks for the $50, dude.
[10:11.42]League was so much fun when we played it last night.
[10:16.81]I do- do you remember when I was Twisted Fate?
[10:22.12]And I did that full almost penta?
[10:25.75]I'm not a jungler, typically, so that's why it was hard.
[10:32.68]We've ran it down mid.
[10:34.14]Me as the jungle.
[10:35.24]You as the solo lane.
[10:36.92]We came and we rescued all.
[10:38.04]Remember, it was... Our team consisted of... God, who was it?
[10:44.11]It was... Teemo.
[10:45.99]Me as Twisted Fate, as always.
[10:50.35]You on Ryze.
[10:52.39]And... Dual lane was VI and...
[11:06.90]Garrett?
[11:07.82]Garrison?
[11:08.66]The guy with the sword.
[11:09.81]I forget what his name was.
[11:14.39]Who's the guy with the sword?
[11:15.85]Oh no, wait, that's like a different mobile game that I played.
[11:19.23]Hold on, what's the mobile game where the guy with the sword is the first character?
[11:22.37]It's like a mobile MOBA, and I downloaded it for free.
[11:24.54]I played it for 10 minutes.
[11:25.30]Who was it?
[11:28.78]No, it's not Raid Shadow Legends.
[11:29.94]It was another one.
[11:30.86]It was a popular one.
[11:32.18]No, no, no.
[11:32.98]What is it?
[11:33.64]Arena of Valor.
[11:34.24]There it is.
[11:35.10]Yep.
[11:37.41]Alright, uh, I'm gonna run- wait, wait, wait, I gotta do some stuff, hold on.
[11:44.83]I remember at the last TwitchCon, or maybe we have, it was a TwitchCon, Arena of Valor was in the Twitch Partner Lounge, and it was like, hey, you guys wanna play Arena of Valor?
[11:56.06]And I'm just like, god no, but, oh, yeah, sure!
[12:00.52]Like, yeah, that sounds like fun!
[12:04.70]And I played, like, one round.
[12:07.71]How do I climb down?
[12:10.55]And I know they were going to come over and ask me all these questions.
[12:13.23]We played one round and it was like, dude, hey!
[12:17.75]You finished!
[12:18.79]How was it?
[12:19.37]What do you think?
[12:19.93]Ah!
[12:23.61]It's fine.
[12:24.62]It was fun.
[12:25.32]Oh!
[12:25.38]Alright, it's okay.
[12:30.72]My spine is intact.
[12:40.06]What do you say?
[12:40.58]I think I played... I played Smite, but... No.
[12:44.91]Are you gonna save?
[12:45.63]Yes, of course I am.
[12:47.59]But, yeah, it...
[13:01.99]And then I wanted to, like, avoid the tables where they were.
[13:05.25]I'm fucking weird, guys.
[13:06.53]Like, I didn't want to, like, go back over to the tables because I was, like... I was one of the people that played the game.
[13:12.96]And it was just... Ugh, if I sit over at those tables again, it's gonna be like, Hey, you're back!
[13:17.44]How about another fucking round?
[13:19.80]Yeah.
[13:21.20]No, thank you.
[13:22.28]Yeah, I guess.
[13:24.24]I'm just here for a water.
[13:25.02]I just came in here to get a water.
[13:30.76]But, I mean, it's alright, it's cool, the game's alright, yeah.
[13:33.06]Just wait till we throw this shit in the trash.
[13:43.51]Always pick up the plug, because you run faster.
[13:45.33]That's a tip I got yesterday, but I haven't even started the game yet.
[13:55.57]That's why, I mean, people, you might think I'm weird.
[13:58.81]but going to like twitchcon and stuff I almost want to put like a disguise like a mustache a hat and like sunglasses this is like somebody if somebody comes over in like a partner lounge it's like hey oh chant what are your channels I don't have I got a mustache I don't have one oh okay see you guys around
[14:28.68]You have to do an incognito cosplay like Adam Savage does.
[14:39.07]Doctor Disrespect.
[14:43.75]No, but I'm talking about just like a mustache.
[14:49.33]That might be a good idea.
[14:50.40]I don't know.
[14:54.96]Maybe I would do it one day.
[14:57.87]Ooh, there's a coin in here.
[14:58.65]Nice.
[15:03.04]Just put on, like, fake eyebrows and shit.
[15:07.78]A glue-on, big, bushy mustache.
[15:11.19]And, like, a fake chin strap or something, and just walk around and just... And if anyone comes up to me and asks me what my channel is, I just say, I don't have one.
[15:20.79]Hey, can I interest you in playing some Arena of Valor?
[15:24.63]Wait, wait, wait, who are you?
[15:25.43]You don't have a name tag on you.
[15:26.41]Who are you?
[15:27.64]I don't.
[15:28.32]I just walk around with my mustache.
[15:30.80]I don't give a shit.
[15:31.46]I don't fucking care about you.
[15:32.96]Any partners over here?
[15:33.74]It'll be so much easier.
[15:42.66]Can I get in here?
[15:46.31]Come on, I can get that.
[15:47.03]Alright, it's time to go to bed.
[15:54.30]Oh, there's so many coins.
[15:55.20]Alright, I have to turn the TV on to wake up Dad, right?
[16:01.89]Don't forget the chibi copter.
[16:03.09]Yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right, I do have that.
[16:05.11]I'm just so happy that I actually get to play the game.
[16:10.13]Hannah Montana.
[16:17.66]No, but Hannah Montana just had a different color hair.
[16:20.64]That was it.
[16:23.42]If I walked into TwitchCon with just, like, orange hair, I'm still- I'm Jeremy.
[16:28.28]Like, this doesn't change anything.
[16:35.97]It was two different people.
[16:38.79]No, okay, if Miley Cyrus had a must... Okay, if Miley Cyrus is Hannah Montana, she put on, like, a wig, and, like, a mustache, and, like, sunglasses, and that was Hannah Montana, it might be... You could hide.
[17:00.62]Spoiler alert.
[17:01.90]You don't... Please.
[17:04.42]Please.
[17:09.54]Why do you know so much about Hannah Montana?
[17:12.90]That I know that Hannah Montana is Miley Cyrus?
[17:15.30]The actress that plays Hannah Montana?
[17:20.00]How is that so... That's not a whole lot of information.
[17:24.00]I need to get some real happy points here.
[17:25.08]You bet your ass I want to save it.
[17:37.64]As a fan.
[17:38.34]That show's not even been off the air for 10 years.
[17:40.30]What are you talking about?
[17:52.43]Oh, I thought we were going to bed.
[17:53.37]Oh, I just got up.
[18:04.70]Alright, fine.
[18:05.42]I thought I could go to bed.
[18:06.80]I thought saving did it.
[18:08.38]Did you watch it?
[18:09.12]No, I didn't.
[18:11.44]Yes, okay.
[18:12.14]I have watched Hannah Montana.
[18:15.99]In the same way that you've watched Hannah Montana when you go from Fox Sports to the Disney Channel to Cartoon Network.
[18:24.61]So, I've seen 12 seconds of Hannah Montana.
[18:28.09]Maybe like 4 or 5 episodes worth.
[18:32.78]So...
[18:33.77]We've all seen it.
[18:34.19]Can you make the noise this thing is making?
[18:35.35]Yeah, probably.
[18:35.81]That's pretty close.
[18:36.87]Yeah, I can turn into a super frog.
[18:38.85]Who wants a super frog license?
[19:04.46]And can they come in contact?
[19:06.52]I have some consulting I could do.
[19:07.84]I've got some consulting work I could do for that new game, bringing it back.
[19:13.17]Oh, yes, of course.
[19:14.13]Every time it tells me to, I'm going to save.
[19:15.49]Every time.
[19:24.95]Ugh!
[19:25.09]Alright, let's go.
[19:28.44]I don't think anyone owns Super Frog.

[22:50.43]If you shoot that with the Chibi Blaster, I bet you can go outside.
[22:54.73]Breaking windows won't make Mrs. Sanderson happy at all.
[23:00.56]Can I just say, can we just ask her to slide the door open?
[23:03.67]Can I climb this?
[23:06.51]Alright, I gotta use the chibi copter.
[23:09.87]Oh wait, there's Cheetos under here.
[23:15.83]How much does it cost to get a birthday shoutout from Bugleberry?
[23:18.60]Um... How much does it cost?
[23:24.32]Uh, it costs absolutely nothing.
[23:28.77]I heard it was somebody's birthday.
[23:31.78]Someone told me it was a terrifying birthday party.
[23:36.84]I wish I was invited, but happy birthday to you and to all the people at your birthday party.
[23:43.78]I'll be here in Jeremy's room warding off the ghosts and ghouls.
[23:51.34]Goodbye.
[23:52.70]Get out, get out.
[24:05.09]Do I have that on a hotkey?
[24:07.47]Well, let's charge.
[24:13.65]I'm losing viewers.
[24:15.40]I'm losing viewers.
[24:19.36]Oh, it feels so good just to be able to go like this.
[24:31.51]Oh, that probably hurt.
[24:36.27]Alright, what's left?
[24:38.07]Let's go up.
[24:39.01]I'm going to climb the chair.
[24:39.91]Wait, there's trash.
[24:52.54]Up on the chair.
[24:53.18]There's tons of trash over here too.
[24:55.86]Oh yeah, I love picking up trash.
[24:58.78]Nice.
[25:02.85]This game is, like, exactly what I'm looking for.
[25:05.11]How do I get up there?
[25:08.95]Alright.
[25:09.17]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[25:10.27]Can I jump on this?
[25:12.59]Oh, yeah.
[25:13.87]Oh, yes, I can.
[25:17.48]So why can't I... Hold on.
[25:18.80]Aww.
[25:18.94]Alright, put it away.
[25:24.96]I need to pull this.
[25:29.24]Push it right up against the wall here.
[25:33.42]I can get these bolts.
[25:35.44]And up.
[25:36.98]Yeah.
[25:39.30]Nice.
[25:40.12]That's $50.
[25:40.48]I'm almost out of time.
[25:48.83]Alright, then I'm going to fly over to this here.
[25:58.56]Let's pick up the trash.
[25:59.96]I love this game already.
[26:01.92]I love this game.
[26:03.66]It's so... It's exactly what I'm looking for.
[26:07.92]Every time.
[26:08.47]Uh-oh, I'm almost out of battery.
[26:13.21]It's just about picking up trash and... It's so... There's no stress here.
[26:25.35]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest is on soon.
[26:28.52]Can't wait.
[26:29.08]Woo!
[26:29.98]It's on TV.
[26:33.02]This is a fake news emergency alert.
[26:37.78]Huh?
[26:39.16]This just in.
[26:40.16]Chibi Robos everywhere are coming under attack.
[26:44.15]And the perpetrators appear to be... The Spidewhores.
[26:51.73]where do they come from why do they attack we don't know are those gonna be perhaps they hate Chibi-Robo's winning smile viewers ask yourself is your Chibi-Robo safe or is it in mortal danger this is Ron brookjaw reporting for faux news is it fox news or faux news
[27:18.28]Now let's go to Sunny Merriweather with tomorrow's forecast, Sunny.
[27:24.51]Thanks, Ron.
[27:25.07]You're going to Lifehive forecast.
[27:26.17]Tomorrow will be sunny, rainy, or uphill-y.
[27:27.57]Same energy.
[27:36.34]No, that's all wrong.
[27:37.22]The spiders are the Chibi-Robo's friends.
[27:39.10]They are.
[27:39.48]At least they should be.
[27:40.64]Ah, frosting.
[27:44.11]Listen, Chibi-Robo, you need to be careful.
[27:45.79]Those spiders are dangerous right now.
[27:47.85]And if something were to happen to you, I'd be really sad.
[27:51.09]Got it?
[27:53.51]Why don't you fuckin' put some, like, anti-spider defense system in the house?
[27:57.69]Oh, we just had five community subs just come in.
[28:00.73]Uh, just some normal guy, 25.
[28:01.99]Thanks for the five community subs.
[28:07.14]Uh, I gotta... No, no, no, no!
[28:08.16]I'm trying to pick up the... Hope you made it to number one in the Chibi-Robo ranking.
[28:13.70]Oh, by the way, the room looks really clean today.
[28:16.58]You must have worked so hard.
[28:18.98]Yup.
[28:19.80]Ten happy points from Dad for cleaning up his mess.
[28:33.85]Alright, cool.
[28:34.47]Now I need... I don't think I can make that.
[28:38.01]Alright, I gotta go.
[28:39.13]Let's go plug in.
[28:40.35]Oh, fuck.
[28:43.09]What happens if I go to zero?
[28:46.38]Um, I need an outlet right now.
[28:48.62]Outlet right now.
[28:49.16]Where's an outlet?
[28:50.78]Right now.
[28:52.89]Right now.
[28:53.92]I'm gonna die.
[28:54.68]What happens if Chibi-Robo dies?
[28:56.28]It's okay.
[29:03.68]We got saved by the bell.
[29:06.91]Chibi-Robo?
[29:08.19]Time sure flies when you're making folks happy.
[29:11.13]Oh, the day has ended.
[29:12.03]Let's return to the Chibi house.
[29:13.49]Plug in.
[29:14.11]Chibi-Robo?
[29:20.50]I got 60 happy points, though.
[29:22.76]Great work out there.
[29:23.56]Let's adjust your happy point total.
[29:24.52]Your chibi ranking has gone from 591,000 to 192,000.
[29:25.58]So I'm against other chibi robos.
[29:26.30]What are these other 300,000 chibi robos doing?
[29:30.82]400,000 of them.
[29:48.32]I picked up like five pieces of trash.
[29:52.16]Battle Royale.
[29:56.28]They're dying to spiders.
[29:57.48]In order to get the next bonus battery, you need eight more happy points.
[30:01.30]If you're ever going to become super Chibi-Robo, you need some advice, namely mine.
[30:06.82]Use Y to activate your chibi vision and scan your surroundings for items.
[30:13.25]Use R to open up a map of the room and find yourself a nearby outlet.
[30:16.79]Ooh, that's good to know.
[30:19.60]To celebrate opening my advice booth, I'm handing up free advice.
[30:22.64]Sure.
[30:23.94]I would love to say that.
[30:24.88]Going up the rankings.
[30:36.72]Alright, now, can I do anything with the chibi computer?
[30:42.71]Alright, online shop.
[30:43.75]Timer 10, timer 15.
[30:46.45]What do these do?
[30:48.35]10 minutes for half a day for a leisurely pace?
[30:51.59]Come on, no.
[30:53.85]Timer 15.
[30:54.83]15 minutes for half a day for a truly leisurely pace.
[30:59.35]So what, is it better?
[31:03.05]Timer 15.
[31:05.28]Oh.
[31:05.86]Oh, it's a timer.
[31:06.58]I get it.
[31:06.92]So I just get more time.
[31:08.94]Pink flower seed.
[31:10.78]A pink flower will grow from this seed.
[31:15.30]Nectar?
[31:16.36]Chibi Blast.
[31:17.12]There's 1100 bucks.
[31:19.68]I get 15 minutes.
[31:20.60]Yeah, that's better.
[31:21.26]Do I get these seeds?
[31:22.70]Alright, pink flower seed.
[31:26.38]Blue flower seed.
[31:28.57]And... White Flower Seed.
[31:30.58]Okay.
[31:32.94]What about Recycletron?
[31:34.88]Okay.
[31:38.12]Oh, I have to plant these?
[31:45.95]Timer 15.
[31:46.59]Is Chibi-Robo in Smash Bros.? ?
[31:59.82]yes no not yet he's a spirit he's a costume oh yeah he was a me costume he should be a real character pepe hansen
[32:30.98]Alright, what?
[32:31.46]Something about Drake on the TV?
[32:32.98]It's about Drake on TV, right?
[32:37.81]Here's the map.
[32:40.91]Backyard.
[32:41.41]We got plugs.
[32:42.05]C is zoom.
[32:43.27]Oh, that's cool.
[32:44.75]We got plugs everywhere.
[32:45.77]Okay.
[32:46.81]I'm gonna get to turn the TV on.
[32:48.69]And then go read the diary?
[32:52.68]What does this do?
[33:02.19]What's going on?
[33:02.59]Is that a toothbrush?
[33:10.07]What's that?
[33:16.15]Is it a toothbrush?
[33:17.43]Hey, look at that!
[33:18.49]It's Mr. Sanderson's toothbrush, but let's take it anyway.
[33:22.25]I bet he won't miss it.
[33:24.02]Now that we have this nifty device, I bet you can clean all sorts of stains.
[33:31.60]Yes, press X to open the equipment menu.
[33:34.88]Like the toothbrush, and use A to hold it.
[33:38.62]If you want to put the toothbrush away, press B. Look, there's a stain right there.
[33:43.16]Why don't you give it a good scrub?
[33:44.00]Yes!
[33:58.21]Oh, yes.
[33:59.35]I'm so happy.
[34:00.89]I can clean surfaces.
[34:03.28]Look at all these stains over here that I'm gonna get.
[34:04.88]This dog stain.
[34:05.76]What's that?
[34:15.10]It's odd if the TV just turned on all by itself.
[34:18.74]Alright, wanna look?
[34:22.24]Hold on, let's go.
[34:22.78]Ah, can I turn it off?
[34:28.53]Open the drawer.
[34:30.59]Chibi.
[34:31.19]Open the... What's the proper way to address Chibi-Robo?
[34:34.77]CR?
[34:36.07]Chibi?
[34:37.57]Chibi-Robo is too long.
[34:42.17]Cheese?
[34:44.35]Robo?
[34:44.67]Look at that stain right there.
[34:54.01]How do I... How do I put the stain on the wall?
[34:57.53]There's a stain right here!
[35:01.53]How do I get that stain?
[35:02.35]I can't... How do I do this?
[35:04.73]I'm gonna... Oh fuck, I'm out of battery.
[35:15.78]Uh, how do I use first person again?
[35:19.19]There it is.
[35:20.99]Where's the TV?
[35:26.91]The TV's, like, up here.
[35:28.87]Hold on, I guess there's a coin over here.
[35:35.51]Another coin this way?
[35:39.12]Alright, there's a plug.
[35:39.70]I got a plug.
[35:44.30]Under the TV.
[35:44.74]I gotta get up to the TV.
[35:50.61]You're dying.
[35:51.73]I'm fine.
[35:56.11]5G.
[35:56.31]Alright, would you guys take Amazon Instant Delivery?
[36:06.32]Like, when you clicked buy, you got it.
[36:08.50]The technology, like, we're at, like, 10G.
[36:11.60]Technology with these, you just instantly, a drone, got it in front of your door when you press buy, right?
[36:17.87]But you have, this is the noise you hear in your house 24-7.
[36:30.72]No.
[36:33.18]That would also be bad.
[36:42.47]Okay, TV.
[36:45.13]Are we... Alright, there's the TV.
[36:47.03]Don't look at it.
[36:48.73]Don't look at it, TV Robo!
[36:50.09]Get away from it!
[36:50.73]What the hell is that?
[37:01.22]So confused, so conflicted.
[37:04.40]People say evil, people say justice.
[37:08.44]But what is justice and what is evil?
[37:11.00]Do I truly fight on the side of justice?
[37:13.48]Or am I just a fool, a blind fool?
[37:18.16]No, I fight on the side of justice.
[37:21.56]Those who think they can disturb the peace will get a taste of my space fury.
[37:27.55]It's I, Super Frog Falcon!
[37:35.61]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest!
[37:42.06]What are you doing here?
[37:44.04]Aw, Drake Redcrest, you're still as sharp as ever.
[37:46.46]Hi.
[37:56.75]Space Hunter... Redcrest!
[37:59.81]Good morning, chibi-robo.
[38:02.75]What's this?
[38:03.25]No answer, eh?
[38:06.41]Space Hunter Code Part One.
[38:07.83]Greet everyone by yelling.
[38:12.31]Perhaps you have been shocked into silence by the sight of toys moving.
[38:16.45]Do not be afraid, friend.
[38:17.55]The toys in this house move and speak when humans aren't around.
[38:21.01]Enough talking bores, Drake Redcrest.
[38:22.87]Let us be friends, oh diminutive one.
[38:26.92]As a friend, it is my duty to inform you that your life appears to need more justice.
[38:32.30]Drake Redcrest can solve that problem.
[38:35.34]Take this special gift.
[38:38.68]It's just for you.
[38:41.32]What's in it?
[38:49.28]Drake Redcrest's suit.
[38:52.20]Have I shown you how to don it, friend?
[38:55.78]Yes.
[38:56.20]How do I put this on?
[38:57.12]Immediately.
[38:58.66]Your honesty is noble and must be rewarded.
[39:00.70]Therefore, Drake Redcrest shall teach you.
[39:04.94]What?
[39:05.04]You can put on costumes?
[39:27.79]I'm just along for the ride.
[39:28.65]I'm the baby that gets brought to the convention.
[39:30.03]Dad's in Superman costume.
[39:31.11]Mom is Superwoman.
[39:56.89]And I'm also dressed as Superman with a helmet on and stuff.
[40:03.28]Take me around to the convention floor.
[40:05.12]Everyone will be so excited to see me.
[40:09.74]Wait, do I talk to him again?
[40:10.82]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest.
[40:19.35]Okay, so I talk to you again if I want to do justice.
[40:23.03]Looks good on you, little man.
[40:24.30]So you wish to fight for truth and justice, eh?
[40:27.42]Don't lie.
[40:28.70]I know these things.
[40:30.84]Yes.
[40:38.41]That's a specialty of mine.
[40:39.49]You just sit back and enjoy the ride.
[40:41.79]Alright, let's go to the convention.
[40:45.61]Hold.
[40:47.01]Stand your ground.
[40:51.34]Very well, my small metal friend.
[40:52.96]I will now administer the test of justice.
[40:57.66]It will be long, hard, and a word I don't know.
[41:02.18]But you must endure no matter the cost.
[41:04.83]Ready?
[41:05.11]Then we ride.
[41:07.29]Mock my words, Mockingwell.
[41:09.57]Space Hunter Code Part 2.
[41:10.67]True justice cannot exist without a pose.
[41:19.15]You'll never be an agent of justice unless you master this.
[41:23.29]Old friend.
[41:25.33]You must be the one known as Television.
[41:28.03]Whoa, how did you know my name?
[41:33.15]You laugh a lot.
[41:38.49]Ha!
[41:39.93]Ha!
[41:40.87]I could scream it, but I don't want to.
[41:42.78]That's Justice 101, my flying metal friend.
[41:45.48]Wow, that's impressive.
[41:50.87]We're about to enter dangerous skies here.
[41:54.19]You must fly back.
[41:56.85]Are you ready?
[41:57.37]Here's the skinny.
[41:59.17]When I start to pose, press Z immediately.
[42:05.58]Easy as pie, right?
[42:07.26]Sure.
[42:07.94]Press Z immediately when he starts posing.
[42:11.20]You can do it, Chibi-Robo.
[42:12.20]Okay, here we go.
[42:18.11]I did it.
[42:20.06]Too slow!
[42:20.72]Curses and blasts!
[42:21.68]Try it again!
[42:29.89]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest.
[42:32.37]I learned the pose.
[42:36.95]Wow, that's fantastic.
[42:38.51]You're the best, Chibi-Robo.
[42:42.49]Aha!
[42:44.72]Stupendously done, Chibi-Robo.
[42:47.68]I mean, Space Hunter Robo.
[42:50.60]I am now proud to appoint you as the universe's 99th space hunter.
[42:56.12]Climb the rankings and assassinate the other 98 space hunters to reach number one assassin.
[43:03.86]Oh, I got 19 happy points of that, and 100 bucks.
[43:06.89]Spread the happiness.
[43:17.30]You master Drake Redcrest's Z action.
[43:20.24]Show everyone what you can do with it.
[43:21.68]I just have to pose in front of people?
[43:23.96]Think of justice when you wear this.
[43:27.57]You're on, Hunter.
[43:33.03]Wait, what?
[43:35.04]Oh, I'm just showing it to him.
[43:38.98]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest.
[43:42.24]Hello, Space Hunter Robo!
[43:44.38]Your excitement is indeed impressive.
[43:47.07]Seems that the living room is currently in a state of... broccoli-ism.
[43:50.99]That is a word, right?
[43:53.93]Of course it is!
[43:55.83]In regardlessness, I shall leave you in charge of tomorrow's patrol, Space Hunter Chibi-Robo.
[44:03.89]Let's clean up.
[44:06.47]Wait, doesn't... Alright, the person over here with the diary, should I do the pose?
[44:12.18]I'm gonna freak this person out.
[44:13.36]They're gonna think, look, this is a reverse disguise.
[44:15.52]Ready?
[44:20.01]Look who it is.
[44:22.17]Hey.
[44:22.65]What do you think about this?
[44:30.41]Oh my... What was that sound?
[44:35.34]That handsome sound?
[44:36.96]Drake?
[44:37.70]Red Crist?
[44:39.44]Oh my gosh!
[44:41.47]Um, um, um, you patrol really good.
[44:43.13]Uh, Sophie, no, that was so stupid.
[44:46.33]What's up with her?
[45:02.58]Well, what the fuck is going on over here in chat?
[45:08.86]Put it in sub only.
[45:09.68]Put it in sub only.
[45:10.78]We gotta... Come on.
[45:12.16]What is this horseshit?
[45:13.62]Sub only.
[45:14.10]Let's go.
[45:14.44]Let's get it in sub only.
[45:25.59]We good?
[45:27.17]We good.
[45:27.65]Okay.
[45:28.31]What the fuck?
[45:36.34]Alright, we're back.
[45:38.42]Alright, now we can go into the kitchen.
[45:42.55]But now we can't.
[45:45.17]I gotta plug in first.
[45:53.37]Imagine eating ass.
[45:54.88]Imagine.
[46:00.42]You're fully recharged.
[46:01.42]Now, yes, I'd love to save.
[46:06.65]How many costumes are there in the game?
[46:07.91]I feel like there should be a lot.
[46:09.73]I need to collect at least four of them.
[46:23.14]I want to be free.
[46:24.82]Don't worry, you will be soon.
[46:32.12]In fact, alright, you know what?
[46:35.62]Put it in a follower-only mode instead.
[46:38.18]But follower-only, you gotta be following the channel for at least, what, like 30 minutes, something like that?
[46:42.06]Follower-only?
[46:47.55]Leave that word.
[46:49.23]It's always in follower-only, but... Length of time, though.
[46:52.97]One day follower-only, maybe?
[46:56.75]One year follower-only.
[46:58.09]I don't know about that one.
[47:00.81]I gotta clean, hold on.
[47:09.69]You can't even do that!
[47:10.49]I love phoning with the toothbrush.
[47:12.41]Remember, you're almost at 10 million views.
[47:14.97]What am I at right now?
[47:15.95]See, she's giving me a bunch of bonus happy points and moolah.

[47:39.72]MonkaS, what's he doing?
[47:42.74]Your happy point bonus is... 8 happy points.
[47:47.28]That doesn't seem like very much.

[48:30.08]Fuck, I'm almost at a battery.
[48:31.02]I got a lot of... Wait, there's a plug right here, right?
[48:34.26]Okay.
[48:38.10]Oh fuck, there's no bug here.
[48:48.09]What does the ten millionth viewer get?
[48:51.83]There's no way to tell.
[48:58.15]There's no way to tell who is the ten millionth viewer.
[49:01.93]This isn't a radio station.
[49:15.30]A bream bin.
[49:16.04]Thanks for five community subs, bream bin.
[49:17.50]Appreciate it.
[49:18.68]Thanks for the five subs.
[49:21.48]Community subs.

[49:26.45]Yeah, I'm going to call it frog coins because I love Super Mario RPG.
[49:29.61]Legend of the Seven Stars.
[49:33.09]I want to get up there.
[49:33.81]There's so much to do.
[49:35.15]Alright, let's trash, trash.
[49:36.35]Throw the trash away.
[49:44.06]Play Bowser's Inside Story.
[49:45.74]LOL.
[49:46.76]Like, that's as good as Super Mario RPG, Legends of the Seven Stars.
[49:49.75]Probably isn't.
[49:51.57]No, it probably isn't.
[49:52.25]But it's still probably just as good.
[49:54.77]It's my favorite game, like, ever made.
[49:55.99]But it's gonna be hard to top it.
[49:57.45]Five community subs from Jamie.
[49:58.95]Thank you, Jamie.
[50:06.28]Thanks a lot for the sub.

[50:15.36]A lot of happy points.
[50:22.81]10 million viewer gets a dork cube.
[50:24.51]But there's no way to tell who the 10 million viewer is.
[50:26.55]You can't... There's no way for me to tell.
[50:39.39]Alright, I wanna get up there.
[50:41.49]Yeah, up here.
[50:42.69]Is that- what is this guy- is that- I can plug- I can plug into this guy?
[50:45.39]I can give this guy power?
[50:48.95]All sub only mode does is just give plebs extra space for sub points.
[50:57.13]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[51:02.07]I know- I gotta make that more money.
[51:03.59]I have to make that more money.

[51:20.25]What's in here?
[51:23.79]What the fuck?
[51:24.51]Look at all this money!
[51:28.03]Whoa!
[51:30.87]There's a little secret, uh, charging power money station.
[51:37.42]Imagine paying five dollars a month to type poop dick.
[51:43.93]Um, that, you don't think that's worth it?
[51:49.94]Dum de dum de dum.
[51:51.52]Hey, since this small door has your eyes, let's call it a chibi door.
[51:55.48]Okay.
[51:57.23]Alright, he's got a lot of money.
[52:07.58]It's so simple.
[52:11.02]If I say one thing, you guys, it's so simple.
[52:14.27]Everyone just starts saying it.
[52:20.95]Okay, we're going to do an experiment.
[52:23.69]I'm going to say something and you're going to repeat it.

[54:15.08]Best stream.
[54:15.60]I didn't see once my name.
[54:25.55]I didn't see one time.
[54:27.89]Really?
[54:28.27]Not even once?
[54:42.70]Let's try another one.
[54:43.46]Poopoo.
[54:44.16]I want to have that one.
[54:45.22]Poopoo.
[54:45.96]I want to write that one.

[54:47.22]He's an egomaniac.
[55:12.85]Can I climb this?
[55:27.24]Maybe I can float.
[55:32.10]That's exactly why I don't like Twitch.
[55:35.08]Wait, what?
[55:37.82]I can float over here.
[55:45.05]Got it.
[55:45.67]Yes.
[55:45.91]Can I climb here?
[55:47.29]Oh, we can go up the whole thing.
[55:52.02]Play better.
[55:52.52]What?
[55:55.04]I just did something good.
[55:55.80]Now I can float from here.
[55:57.12]Is there another coin up here?
[55:59.84]Oh, I can get... Turn the light off?
[56:01.14]Alright, turn the light off.
[56:06.29]Oh no, I can go up.
[56:09.09]Jerma lied about the frog coin.
[56:10.55]Thanks for the... What?
[56:15.81]Thanks to the subs.
[56:16.41]What?
[56:16.71]What does that even mean?
[56:17.81]Alright, we're up here.
[56:21.41]Ooh, there's another chibi door.
[56:24.09]Alright, put this shit away.
[56:24.89]Come here.
[56:25.63]Is there a plug?
[56:28.72]I almost died.
[56:32.34]Look at all this.
[56:37.96]Okay, wait.
[56:38.50]Let's charge up.
[56:39.60]Wait, this is going to take a lot of energy.
[56:42.60]How much is it going to take?
[56:45.80]It's okay.
[56:47.96]There's money in here.
[56:51.34]It's a lot of money.
[56:51.88]Alright, I can't clean anything up here yet.
[56:55.43]Should I knock this off?
[56:57.15]I'm gonna knock this off.
[57:00.37]Push it off, right?
[57:01.51]Should I push this off?
[57:02.25]There's probably something in here.
[57:11.94]It went too far.
[57:14.08]What's it doing?
[57:14.96]Is it crying?
[57:15.98]Is this a funeral?
[57:17.82]Oh, Chibi-Robo, look at the state you're in.
[57:38.30]And I thought maybe we could make it to the top of the chibi ranking together.
[57:50.32]Is that it?
[57:52.32]Oh, I can move.
[57:53.02]Oh, you're alive!
[57:54.82]I was worried sick.
[58:00.24]Remember, you're a robot.
[58:02.08]If your energy ever drops to zero, you'll switch off just like that.
[58:05.18]Watch your charge.
[58:07.02]And use an outlet if you have to recharge.
[58:08.48]Oh, and should know, if you ever pass out like that again, don't get too worried.
[58:13.53]Your faithful friend Television, that's me, will carry you back to the chibi house.
[58:20.19]Oh, another thing.
[58:20.97]If you press X and select Remove, you'll change out of your trauma suit.
[58:29.04]Oh, uh, it looks like you lost some moolah.
[58:30.90]What?
[58:31.34]Don't look at me!
[58:33.55]Oh no, you lose money.
[58:35.89]I'll give you a robo.
[58:38.49]You can buy cheapy batteries from the online shop now.
[58:40.81]They'll come in handy, I think.
[58:42.77]If you get one of these, you can recover just enough energy to go in and recharge yourself.
[58:50.55]Go on up and try it out.
[58:52.09]I'm definitely upgraded.
[58:59.26]Or by now.
[58:59.62]I'm in the top 25,000!
[59:00.28]We're making it into the top 100,000.
[59:01.42]Citrus Soft has sent you a special gift, a brand new bonus battery.
[59:03.44]Would you look at that?
[59:04.04]Your battery power went up 100.
[59:04.66]To 100.
[59:04.78]Ooh.
[59:04.86]Oh, nice.
[59:24.42]I need 21 more happy points.
[59:25.68]Alright, they wanted me to, let's buy something.
[59:30.46]I'm sure we can save.
[59:32.83]From Sov?
[59:36.87]Alright, take it off Sov only.
[59:41.71]Alright, get it off Sov only.
[59:47.18]Okay.
[59:49.49]Chibi battery.
[59:51.65]Alright, I can buy the blaster or a battery.
[59:56.13]Do I get a battery?
[60:03.45]Why were we on sub only?
[60:05.18]Because it was some fucking boss.
[60:06.74]I don't know.
[60:07.90]Eat that, you know what I mean?
[60:11.24]Alright, so here we go.
[60:12.94]Blaster.
[60:15.39]Got it.
[60:16.25]I don't have any more money.
[60:24.58]Thank you for your visit.
[60:32.76]So now I have a gun.
[60:42.25]Okay, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
[60:45.60]Aim that at me, you stupid.
[60:47.63]You've upgraded.
[60:48.29]Keep it up, Chibi-Robo.
[60:49.35]Let's go.
[61:03.16]Freedom, freedom!
[61:05.68]Jump only forever!
[61:17.52]Did I take it off?
[61:18.14]Alright.
[61:21.00]There we go.
[61:23.10]We're good.
[61:25.91]Welcome back.
[61:26.31]Alright, I wanted to do... I want to get back up there.
[61:39.54]Released from pleb storage.
[61:44.00]Pleb storage.
[61:46.56]That's funny.
[61:48.62]Press Z?
[61:53.73]What just happened?
[61:54.27]I just took like 400 damage!
[61:59.63]I don't have any trash?
[62:00.67]Why would you- what's the point of that?
[62:02.56]Oh!
[62:02.62]Excuse me!
[62:17.20]Alright, let's put a hole in the door, right?
[62:18.66]We can go... Chibi Blaster.
[62:20.41]Okay.
[62:24.05]And... Fire.
[62:41.29]Why am I hurt?
[62:41.91]Because I fell off the top of the building, whatever it was.
[62:44.75]Yipes!
[62:45.87]Didn't do it.
[62:46.39]Wasn't me.
[62:46.85]Don't deactivate me.
[62:47.81]We're in the backyard.
[62:52.25]They welcomed you into their home.
[62:58.44]It's so cute.
[62:59.22]I love it.
[63:00.30]Oh, you can do first person.
[63:02.76]Oh, wow!

[63:13.27]Put this away.
[63:13.73]Alright, I need an outlet back here.
[63:33.42]I love these little chibi doors.
[63:43.24]Is there outlets outside?
[63:44.18]Probably not.
[63:46.28]There's so many things to do.
[63:47.46]I have so many jobs to do.
[63:49.82]I need outlet.
[63:53.26]How would there be an outlet outside?
[63:59.36]I know, I know, I know.
[64:00.26]I'll get it in a second.
[64:01.62]I have to leave.
[64:02.14]27 stains.
[64:04.32]Your happy point bonus is...
[64:13.96]Fourteen.
[64:14.54]I have outdoor outlets.
[64:18.88]Yeah, you can have outdoor.
[64:19.70]That's not out of the ordinary.
[64:20.82]Your very presence makes everyone happy.
[64:26.22]Okay.
[64:26.72]Alright, alright, alright.
[64:27.46]Pick up the... Let's go.

[64:32.65]Outlet, outlet, outlet.
[64:40.25]Nearest outlet is...
[64:44.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:46.33]Okay, there's one over here.
[64:51.09]I almost pressed Z. I almost just hit my head on the ground.
[64:58.00]Oh, it's almost time to go home anyways.
[65:00.90]Alright, here's an outlet.
[65:03.62]Wait, was that a lie too?
[65:04.40]Was there no outlet right here?
[65:06.26]Oh, was that a lie too?
[65:09.40]Where is it?
[65:25.69]Is it up?
[65:27.13]Where is it?
[65:29.72]Oh fuck, it's up there, huh?
[65:31.94]Uh-oh.
[65:35.88]Am I blind?
[65:36.24]What do you mean blind?
[65:36.96]Behind what?
[65:38.42]Behind this?
[65:39.00]No, that's up.
[65:49.03]What do you mean blind?
[65:50.35]It's like apparently up here.
[65:54.08]Is it behind this?
[66:01.19]Um, Chibi-Robo, did you just hear that totally weird sound?
[66:04.72]Yes, I did.
[66:05.18]I heard a strange noise coming from the far side of the foyer.
[66:07.14]I'm scared.
[66:26.76]Wait, there's... Okay, there is one behind here.
[66:31.06]There's one right here.
[66:32.02]He thought I was dead.
[66:35.32]Bart!
[66:36.20]Bart!
[66:36.52]I'll never get over that, will I?
[66:40.58]Okay, let's go.
[66:57.50]Alright, so there's one back there.
[67:02.48]Did I pick up any?
[67:03.80]I didn't pick up any trash.
[67:05.30]Almost time to go to bed.
[67:06.12]The coin.
[67:12.49]Here's a list of your nominees.
[67:13.99]Can we remove that?
[67:17.33]Oh, I gotta cancel Surgent Monkey.
[67:19.66]Alright, yeah, what has it been, like, three months?
[67:21.82]Alright.
[67:24.34]Alright, yeah.
[67:31.05]Ooh, trash!
[67:31.65]Can I get behind this?
[67:41.28]No, alright, we're about to go to bed.
[67:43.66]I should've- I think I upgraded.
[67:44.67]What the hell do you want me to use it for right now?
[68:00.96]It's coming from the foyer again.
[68:02.00]Yeah, well, I don't have time to investigate.
[68:04.16]It's time for bed.
[68:09.14]Cringe.
[68:09.52]He said it, guys.
[68:10.38]It's just a stupid word.
[68:12.94]I can say it.
[68:16.98]Alright.
[68:18.58]What's left in here?
[68:19.90]Can I go back up?
[68:21.50]I want to go up here.
[68:22.28]You know what I mean?
[68:24.96]I want to go up there.
[68:27.80]I gotta climb up the thing, the lamp, like I did before.
[68:32.30]And then I have to fly over here.
[68:33.56]That's what I'm doing tomorrow.

[72:59.23]Um, it's an intruder, sir.
[73:01.35]I think it came from the living room, sir.
[73:04.39]From a former perimeter, man.
[73:07.05]Yes, sir.
[73:09.15]Go, go, go.
[73:18.38]Defensive positions Uh, there's a lot more than I thought there was M&Ms
[73:45.93]Nice move.
[73:52.57]What the fuck was that for?
[73:55.69]He just killed that guy.
[74:01.65]An unauthorized intruder has entered the area.
[74:04.09]A free ranger's pride is at stake.
[74:06.77]Stop the intruder or I'll make you egg salad.
[74:09.47]If he comes into range, let him have it.
[74:13.51]Don't let your guard down, men.
[74:21.60]Um... I just looked for a plug.
[74:24.94]TBRobo, this isn't good.
[74:27.74]Oh, yes, it's not good.
[74:28.88]Wait, no, it isn't good, or yes, it's not good.
[74:30.76]It's kind of a hard way to answer that question.
[74:33.59]This isn't good.
[74:34.41]Yes, it isn't good.
[74:35.75]Yes, it is not good.
[74:37.53]Okay.
[74:39.89]Strange sound is coming from over there.
[74:48.71]It's gonna be really hard to get over there.
[74:50.07]These rangers mean business.
[74:54.66]Okay, well then, so do I. You don't think I mean business too?
[75:08.10]It's just like, I just put it away.
[75:11.78]First person mode is here.
[75:15.65]Well, how do I go to first person?
[75:24.12]I can't go into first person.
[75:26.84]Z?
[75:27.02]You can't move and go FPS.
[75:34.42]It's not Z?
[75:42.38]It's Y, Y, Y, Y. Okay, okay, hold on.
[75:44.50]I'll just plug in.
[75:47.82]Okay.
[75:58.62]Put that away.
[76:00.60]Alright, now they're fucking dead.
[76:07.31]Stay plugged in?
[76:09.11]Hey, where's the extension cord?
[76:11.57]Why can't I just stay plugged into the wall?
[76:13.01]Uh, I don't need to save right now.
[76:23.87]Alright.
[76:24.67]Why?
[76:25.35]Where did it?
[76:25.77]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:26.51]Alright, let's go.
[76:27.13]Let's go FPS these guys.
[76:43.01]Here we go.
[76:44.53]Unauthorized intruder!
[76:46.07]Don't let him pass.
[76:48.39]Take him out.
[76:51.81]TV Robo, this isn't good.
[76:53.67]Yes, it isn't good Gonna be really hard to get over there.
[76:59.13]You'll never get through unless you find something you can use to cover yourself Okay, literally impossible, literally impossible, literally impossible without a new item
[77:28.62]This actually, this is physically impossible.
[77:30.52]It's not possible.
[77:32.88]TV Robo, you can't do it.
[77:33.96]I get yelled at every time I go.
[77:34.88]Alright, physically impossible without a shield.
[77:42.39]Just run?
[77:42.81]Nah, it's physically impossible.
[77:44.29]The television told me.
[77:46.59]Everything you see on the television that comes out of the television's mouth is real.
[77:53.61]You can't move while in first person.
[78:05.41]Let's go.
[78:09.40]I want to do the thing I wanted to do before.
[78:10.60]I want to go up the... over this way.

[82:36.38]That's, okay, it's a dog toy.
[82:38.38]That makes sense.
[82:42.88]That's a dog toy.
[82:46.15]Alright, let's, uh, plug it in.
[82:50.99]Dog's our friend.
[83:05.43]Does it make her any less human?
[83:09.31]Well, if you're a dog toy, that means you are not a human.
[83:15.00]You are a stuffed dog toy.
[83:17.58]Crash.
[83:30.28]Can I crawl?
[83:32.54]Ooh, whoa, this is the dog's bed.
[83:36.12]Wait, hold on, how do I get up here?
[83:40.06]I can't get up there.
[83:41.54]There's a box and there's like a necklace up there.
[83:44.17]Alright, I'll get it later.
[83:46.07]Little bit of track, can I open it?
[83:52.05]I can open this thing up for her.
[83:54.91]Can this be opened?
[83:59.92]Nope.
[84:02.04]Are you talking to the dog?
[84:06.29]What's the dog gonna say?

[84:42.93]Uh-huh.
[84:47.50]Let's get up here.
[84:48.76]That was a gold coin.
[84:57.48]Yeah, a new spot to find... ...frinkets and shit.
[85:00.82]Let's up here.
[85:04.83]Ooh, what can I do?
[85:07.22]Okay, I can grab that.
[85:08.42]Can I not grab that?
[85:11.40]I can't grab, like, the yarn?
[85:18.24]Yeah, there we go.
[85:22.14]Keep going.

[85:24.29]Alright, get on this.
[85:28.61]No!
[85:29.23]Oh, sh-
[85:35.16]What's the point of being on the towel?
[85:41.37]Wait, what does it want to do with the milk?
[85:46.85]Oh, it's trash, okay.
[85:53.21]Toaster!
[85:54.31]Do I make toast?
[85:55.11]Do I plug into the toaster?
[86:01.50]Come on, I've got to be able to do something with the toaster.
[86:08.26]Alright, this time, I'm not going to push that off yet, because I know I'm going to need it.
[86:11.98]Right?
[86:13.45]Let's keep going up, while I still have power.
[86:22.93]What is all the way up here?
[86:28.05]Oh, there's a door!
[86:28.71]There's a demon door up here.
[86:39.57]Let's go.
[86:46.53]I'm pretty high, too.
[86:47.45]Nice.
[86:52.77]Alright.
[86:53.47]Now, I want to take a look.
[86:57.37]Mug.
[86:58.11]Spoon.
[86:59.75]Dog tags.
[87:00.57]Okay, I could float from here to there and get the dog tags.
[87:08.56]I could go get the spoon.
[87:09.88]There's a bandage.
[87:10.62]There's a frog ring.
[87:17.32]Go to mom.
[87:18.42]Alright, I gotta go from here to there.
[87:20.04]Alright, let's make it.
[87:21.69]Let's go.
[87:21.95]Let's go.
[87:23.45]I need an outlet.
[87:24.01]Can I grab this thing when it comes back around?
[87:28.27]Can I jump onto the clock?
[87:34.17]Or should I just float from here to there?
[87:35.27]I don't know.
[87:39.70]This is kind of freaking me out.
[87:40.68]Can I hold on to it?
[87:42.98]Alright, let's go.
[87:43.40]Hurry up.
[87:43.80]What's the fast-forward time button?
[87:50.26]Jump in the toaster.
[87:51.40]Okay, can I grab it?
[87:58.49]Grab the... Grab it.
[88:00.49]I can't grab it.
[88:01.13]Toaster.
[88:15.04]I need a battery.
[88:19.16]I need a plug.
[88:21.32]I need a plug.
[88:21.74]I need a plug.
[88:22.16]I need a plug.
[88:22.52]Where's the plugs in here?
[88:23.20]I need a plug right now.
[88:25.02]Come on.
[88:25.34]There's got to be an outlet over here.
[88:26.50]Where's the... Okay, there's a plug.
[88:33.60]Across.
[88:35.29]Uh-oh.
[88:52.24]Nope, I'm dead.
[88:55.92]I can't make that.
[89:00.24]Shit!
[89:04.52]No!
[89:05.70]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[89:08.12]How do I... I just did so much stuff.
[89:16.00]I'm not gonna move.
[89:20.50]Time's gonna run out.
[89:27.18]Go to the plug.
[89:27.80]I can't make it.
[89:30.88]Five.
[89:33.84]Four.
[89:35.00]Oh, I can make it.
[89:35.76]Yes.
[89:37.84]Oh, yes.
[89:39.08]Ah.
[89:46.60]I didn't know if I could make it.
[89:52.13]Stop dying.
[89:52.77]I've only died once.
[89:53.59]I've only died one time.
[89:56.09]Come on.
[89:57.23]Stop dying in flames.
[89:58.35]I've died like five times.
[90:01.06]What the fuck was that?
[90:11.44]Where did that come from?
[90:14.19]Am I alright?
[90:25.30]who fell off?
[90:25.88]Alright, well... Ooh!
[90:28.48]I already got this one, right?
[90:30.08]Yeah, I got that coming in.
[90:35.54]Can I get... Let's talk to mom in the few minutes we have left.
[90:39.01]What about dog food?
[90:39.83]Can I talk to mom?
[90:53.81]I'm busy right now, Tau.
[90:55.51]It's me.
[91:03.11]Wait, I can climb this.
[91:05.79]These little lips.
[91:10.11]Oh, that's it.
[91:11.71]Wait.
[91:12.01]Grrr.
[91:13.20]Grrr.
[91:15.82]Be quiet, Tau.
[91:22.54]Uh, I don't think I can get up there anymore.
[91:24.50]Look out!
[91:26.70]What?
[91:27.80]That was close.
[91:29.56]You almost hurt yourself.
[91:30.78]What?
[91:31.44]You be careful, Chibo.
[91:33.54]I was trying to figure out what people call him.
[91:36.33]It's Chibo. ...
[91:54.92]Mug.
[91:56.66]Ugh.
[91:57.94]Oh, Chibo.
[91:59.68]I'm sorry for saying you were a waste of moolah on Jenny's birthday.
[92:04.66]I'm making my husband sleep on the sofa until he's sorry for what he did.
[92:07.68]What?
[92:07.88]I thought you just said sorry to me.
[92:09.93]Don't worry about it.
[92:10.51]It's his fault, not yours.
[92:15.89]Mug.
[92:18.11]My mug.
[92:20.07]That's a Drake Redcrest mug.
[92:21.65]Cool.
[92:28.13]Gee, Bo, that belongs to my husband.
[92:29.70]I don't know if... Oh, forget it.
[92:31.20]Go ahead and take it.
[92:35.00]He's got so much Drake Redcrest stuff.
[92:37.26]He'll never know I gave something away.
[92:39.36]Um, get rid of this fruit.
[92:45.38]Applies everywhere, Mom.
[92:50.15]Come on, really?
[92:52.47]Disgusting.
[92:53.37]Alright, I got like 10 seconds before this is over.
[92:58.11]Might as well collect a few coins.
[93:04.17]Turn the stove on.
[93:04.93]Can I turn on the stove?
[93:12.86]Turn all burners on.
[93:14.18]I guess I can climb it.
[93:20.59]Can I not climb that?
[93:28.81]It's a ladder?
[93:31.54]It is a ladder.
[93:33.42]Alright, should I get this thing?
[93:35.80]The ladle?
[93:37.24]The pan?
[93:45.36]Wait.
[93:47.47]There's a fan up here.
[93:48.93]Oh, I can clean this.
[93:49.61]There's oil up here.
[93:51.05]Alright, give me the cleaning brush.
[93:55.65]Nice.
[93:57.07]Oh look, more oil.
[94:05.19]That's it?
[94:05.49]Alright, there's a little more.
[94:07.05]That was a tough one.
[94:09.95]Any more oil?
[94:18.40]Hey Lord Repta!
[94:21.50]Lord Repta, thanks for the five community subs.
[94:24.04]And also Bitslave gave another fifty dollars.
[94:30.66]So Bitslave is at 10,000 bits today, which is fucking crazy.
[94:35.18]A lot of money, Bitslave.
[94:37.40]Bitslave says, do you have any plans on Majora's Mask or Wind Waker?
[94:40.80]Maybe both.
[94:41.44]I do not.
[94:41.98]I do not have a plan to play any Zelda games.
[94:49.35]Sorry to say.
[94:54.35]Well, plan on it.
[94:59.73]I don't know.
[95:00.89]Look, I got all this to do first.
[95:03.51]We got Mario Sunshine to do first.
[95:05.01]That's priority number one.
[95:09.17]I was slowly going up the rankings.
[95:10.56]Now I'm not as fast as I was before.
[95:11.82]I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.
[95:29.51]I did Ocarina of Time.
[95:30.77]I don't think I ever beat Majora's Mask.
[95:36.25]Dope.
[95:36.41]I, uh... Alright, okay, I'm gonna say something.
[95:38.27]Pfft.
[95:41.73]Uh-oh.
[95:43.69]I'm gonna say something.
[95:48.24]No, I, uh...
[96:03.34]This is a real, real opinion that everybody's going to hate me for.
[96:07.30]I think I've said this before on stream.
[96:14.40]Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done for the industry, I respect it as a series.
[96:23.25]I understand why people love it.
[96:27.59]They don't do it for me.
[96:30.37]Zelda games don't do it for me.
[96:33.04]That's it.
[96:35.52]Of course, I know everything.
[96:36.64]It's an incredible, incredible series.
[96:38.28]It just doesn't really do it for me.
[96:43.67]That's it?
[96:44.23]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[96:57.09]No, I... I've played through all of Ocarina of Time, and it is fantastic.
[97:01.95]It's very, very good, but I just... I just not... I'm just not into him.
[97:07.02]I'm just not into Zelda games.
[97:08.16]I'm just not into him.
[97:09.20]I'm sorry.
[97:09.86]I know, and I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be truthful with you guys.
[97:11.86]I'm not gonna lie to you.
[97:18.90]Now, that wasn't a wink to tell you, just kidding, this is a joke, that I actually do love the whole series, and I play it all the time.
[97:24.02]That's a wink because somebody paid 75,000 channel points.
[97:34.09]Play Breath of the Wild, that'll change your mind.
[97:35.65]Yes, now Breath of the Wild is a different story, I think.
[97:38.97]I probably would really, really like that game.
[97:44.46]Something fell.
[97:48.38]Look, it's the Chibi-Robo-Chibi manual.
[97:55.06]Alright, well, what is it?
[97:56.34]Breath of the Wild sucks, in my opinion.
[98:04.41]Everything I've seen of it, it seems more my jam.
[98:09.05]It seems more my style.
[98:11.03]We'll probably end up playing that at some point.
[98:14.99]I'm certain I would probably really love it.
[98:16.65]I've already stored this in my memory banks, but I think you should read it.
[98:19.38]Okay, let's read it.
[98:24.42]Chibi Manual.
[98:25.66]Thank you for purchasing Chibi-Robo, a member of the Citrusoft robotics family.
[98:30.12]We appreciate your support.
[98:32.36]Chapter 1.
[98:32.96]Well... Alright, well this is just the game manual.
[98:39.10]Welcome to the family.
[98:41.24]Welcome to the family, son.
[98:48.46]Can I get on his hand?
[98:51.34]Mmm, delicious.
[98:52.30]Alright, get on it.
[98:57.67]You're missing lore?
[98:58.37]No, I wanna get back in the kitchen.
[99:01.85]Alright, back to the kitchen.
[99:03.99]Let's plug in after the kitchen.
[99:09.04]I still gotta get up there, too.
[99:10.10]Put his hand in water.
[99:12.66]Roll on that goat wall.
[99:33.74]You've recharged 15 times.
[99:35.54]Are you going to save?
[99:36.58]What is that saying?
[99:37.32]I'm doing too... I'm overcharging?
[99:48.45]Ribbit Robot Squad.
[99:49.67]Alright, now I'm going to go into... Alright, let's clean up this shit because look at this dog shit all over the place.
[100:06.69]Lore-beg-a-LOL.
[100:07.85]Lore-beg-a-LOL.
[100:15.08]You only have 50 charging cycles left.
[100:17.79]Alright, now is the dog sleeping in here?
[100:24.17]No, where's the dog?
[100:35.73]There's clearly no dog in there.
[100:36.93]Yeah, well, wait a minute.
[100:37.87]What a fucking mess!
[100:41.58]There's a sound!
[100:42.32]I'm busy cleaning.
[101:02.27]This is just easy happy points.
[101:04.38]It's like 10, 20 happy points.
[101:12.68]There's a little cleaning bot.
[101:13.78]Alright, now, um, you're the blaster.
[101:15.85]Does this actually work?
[101:17.89]Was I being lied to?
[101:20.65]Sorry, it was a lie.
[101:27.46]Chibi robot, please.
[101:30.63]Jesus Christ.
[101:32.61]What is this?
[101:33.57]What's a frog bus?
[101:35.11]Okay, well, nice.
[101:44.33]Yeah, alright.
[101:44.93]That's a good image.
[101:47.25]It's the bus story, yeah.
[101:52.01]Um... I will... Wait, what's this?
[101:54.73]Oh.
[102:12.87]Why is it all me?
[102:15.13]And by the way, the frog was a lot further away.
[102:19.45]At least 200 feet away from the bus stop.
[102:21.65]Alright, I need a battery pack charging station, which is over here.
[102:31.25]And then I'm going back up.
[102:34.19]I'm going up to the top.
[102:45.88]This world is a germless world.
[102:50.36]This is awesome.
[102:51.66]The guy was going so crazy.
[102:53.20]He was doing so many movements.
[102:55.08]Alright.
[103:00.86]I need to go explore over here in the kitchen.
[103:03.65]Oh, look it.
[103:04.13]She's on the counter.
[103:04.79]I gotta go visit.
[103:07.63]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[103:09.85]Quest, quest, quest.
[103:10.93]Give me a mission.
[103:11.45]Give me something to do.
[103:28.63]Hello What do you got?
[103:31.99]Jesus
[104:01.13]Eek, eek!
[104:02.93]Drake?
[104:04.49]Oh my, you're here to see me?
[104:05.97]Little old me?
[104:07.53]Wait a second.
[104:09.29]You're much smaller than Drake.
[104:11.93]Is that you, Chibi-Robo?
[104:14.50]Uh-oh.
[104:15.52]No.
[104:16.84]Do I know?
[104:18.90]Yes?
[104:19.64]What should I say?
[104:22.60]Busted.
[104:24.06]No, it's not me.
[104:25.16]It's Drake.
[104:29.51]No, it's not.
[104:30.31]No, it's me, Drake.
[104:33.07]You can't fool me.
[104:33.81]Drake is much too manly to be so small.
[104:36.93]Don't startle me like that.
[104:38.09]Alright, let's say yes.
[104:44.67]Eek!
[104:49.11]Drake?
[104:50.47]Oh my, you're here to see me?
[104:51.91]You're much smaller than Drake.
[104:56.33]Is that you, Chibi-Robo?
[104:58.23]Yeah, it's me.
[105:01.47]Oh, okay.
[105:04.49]Whatever.
[105:04.81]Alright, I want to go this way, because there's probably something else I can do over here.
[105:08.11]There's coins.
[105:08.67]There's fish over here, too.
[105:09.39]Can I feed the fish?
[105:12.33]Ooh, what can I do?
[105:15.47]You want to give something to the fish?
[105:19.05]Cookie crumbs!
[105:19.87]Alright, cookies?
[105:24.24]Let's give cookies cookie crumbs.
[105:37.95]You got 16 happy points.
[105:40.19]Wow.
[105:41.31]And they paid me 16 bucks.
[105:44.97]Are there any more cookies?
[105:50.56]Would I like a twig?
[105:51.34]Should I put a twig in here?
[105:54.88]I mean, maybe it'll be more environment stuff.
[105:58.54]No, they can't eat that.
[105:59.28]Alright, will I get... Am I gonna give them trash?
[106:10.15]Okay, let's keep going.
[106:11.57]There's more- there's a plug over here.
[106:16.32]Over here.
[106:18.16]Let's charge up.
[106:22.92]Fish love trash.
[106:25.42]Um, I- nope, nothing else.
[106:28.08]Am I gonna save?
[106:30.79]No, no need.
[106:31.77]Is it a jar of honey?
[106:41.83]Ooh!
[106:42.33]Okay, there's another demon door over there.
[106:44.47]What about this?
[106:45.09]Okay, pick up the honey, pick up the jar.
[106:51.64]No, it's just coins.
[106:52.50]Ooh, another demon door.
[106:53.70]Alright, hold on.
[106:55.44]Let me... I gotta get up here.
[107:00.20]I can't climb that?
[107:01.68]Ow.
[107:02.04]What?
[107:02.64]Come on.
[107:06.95]I can't climb this can of beans or whatever this is?
[107:08.63]No way.
[107:19.44]I know the sound.
[107:25.46]Shit.
[107:26.83]I can't get up there.
[107:27.55]I have to go up this way.
[107:30.19]Um, hold on.
[107:31.47]Let me see.
[107:32.69]If I go up here, I can... Wait, there's a spoon up there.
[107:39.77]There's a spoon.
[107:40.89]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[107:45.93]Wait.
[107:47.91]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, what?
[107:50.55]Can I go down here?
[107:51.19]Can I get back up?
[107:54.71]Should I go on the drain?
[108:04.88]What the fuck?
[108:12.52]Wait, I'm gonna unclog the drain?
[108:23.34]This is crazy.
[108:24.20]Chibi, you just earned a cleaning bonus.
[108:27.48]Your happy point bonus is... 15.
[108:34.80]This game would make a really good base for a Counter-Strike map.
[108:38.40]Anyone want trash?
[108:38.85]Let's have some dirt over here.
[108:55.01]Alright, there's more over here.
[108:59.26]Let's keep going.
[109:00.40]Look at how much trash is down here.
[109:05.02]Look at this.
[109:06.16]It's disgusting over here.
[109:07.64]Look at all this junk.
[109:19.01]Okay, I'm gonna fly for us.
[109:23.09]No, no, no, no, I wanna fly over there.
[109:31.32]What's that?
[109:31.72]It's a rat!
[109:36.60]Uh... Shoot him!
[109:44.69]I'm almost out of battery.
[109:47.37]I gotta go back up.
[109:49.69]Alright, I'm almost out of battery.
[109:50.75]Look how much money is down here.
[109:51.69]I gotta go.
[109:52.65]I gotta go.
[109:54.11]I'm out.
[110:04.60]The audio is fucked up.
[110:05.76]I think this is the game.
[110:17.33]It's not happening anywhere else.
[110:19.71]That doesn't happen up here.
[110:24.00]Yeah, that's only happening in certain places.
[110:31.88]Uh, okay.
[110:36.34]Um, I need... Where's that battery?
[110:38.32]It's right here?
[110:40.22]Right there.
[110:49.95]I'm not dead, I'm right here.
[111:00.04]Lower the game audio and the settings.
[111:02.84]I don't... I don't think that's... I can't even do that.
[111:17.93]Lower the game difficulty.
[111:20.15]Should I go back down?
[111:23.20]Alright, I'm gonna charge.
[111:24.20]I'm gonna charge and then go back down into the rat cave.
[111:27.90]You're gonna hear some crackling, but it's alright.
[111:39.98]In the emulator settings.
[111:41.60]This is not on an emulator.
[111:48.32]Alright, let him go back down.
[111:54.54]I want to fight the rat.
[112:06.62]Technically, the Wii plays GameCube games by emulating them.
[112:10.89]Okay, fine.
[112:12.79]Okay.
[112:14.29]Sure.
[112:15.51]It's emulated.
[112:16.89]Alright.
[112:20.98]That's not even... That's not even true, because the Wii is just a GameCube.
[112:24.34]We already went over this yesterday.
[112:25.86]The Wii is a GameCube.
[112:27.18]Alright, don't clean, don't clean.
[112:33.37]I'm compulsively cleaning.
[112:41.61]I want to kill that run.
[112:44.03]Alright, so the plan is get those coins.
[112:50.09]If I see a rat, shoot it with the blaster.
[112:53.45]Any rats down here?
[113:08.02]No rat, right?
[113:09.30]I want those coins.
[113:10.02]Can I knock this down?
[113:12.13]Alright, there's a rat in there.
[113:13.15]Alright, this is blocked.
[113:18.39]Alright, blaster.
[113:20.43]Let's shoot him.
[113:29.34]Go!
[113:33.38]Um, wait, what's this?
[113:43.64]Can I jump?
[113:47.17]It's to hide.
[113:47.91]Is there any way I can climb up or anything?
[113:50.45]I can't climb up like this.
[113:52.65]Shit, how do I get up there?
[113:53.47]I don't think I can get up there.
[114:05.86]Trying to push the thing over with the blaster.
[114:13.49]I'm going to assume it's a spring.
[114:16.95]Yeah, no.
[114:19.20]It's probably a spring.
[114:20.50]Let's get out of here.
[114:22.92]We'll come back here later.
[114:23.88]There's a lot of money over there, too.
[114:30.87]Yeah, we'll come back here later.
[114:44.44]Dragged you down by the cord.
[114:46.74]Oh fuck, I'm getting low.
[114:48.82]I'm getting low.
[114:49.83]I'm getting low.
[114:54.59]I'm getting low.
[114:55.49]Oh no!
[114:58.83]Oh no!
[115:00.39]Is it... Four... Three... We're good.
[115:14.96]Alright, that's cool to know.
[115:17.72]Remember the drain, because I gotta remember the drain.
[115:20.10]I'm going back down there when I get... Guys, you said this is like Zelda?
[115:28.42]No, this is like a Metroidvania.
[115:33.09]I'd say that's more like a... Well, actually, Zelda is like a Metroidvania, kind of.
[115:36.37]Yeah, you're right.
[115:36.95]Fuck.
[115:42.01]You get an item to come back and do something else later?
[115:44.01]Yeah.
[115:46.45]Eh, it is like a Metroidvania.
[115:49.75]But... Ooh, wait!
[115:50.57]This is the doghouse!
[116:00.06]Oh, shit.
[116:02.16]These are the dog tags, right?
[116:10.08]TV Robo?
[116:10.82]The Free Rangers were wearing the same kind of things around their necks.
[116:20.79]Safe passage now, right?
[116:21.85]Alright, somebody said to do that.
[116:27.60]It doesn't work.
[116:36.80]Five happy points.
[116:41.70]Alright, nice.
[116:42.74]So now I can go back to the, um... We'll go back to the foyer.
[116:46.02]I might not have enough daytime for this.
[117:01.29]Plug in.
[117:02.27]Fully recharged.
[117:03.39]Are you going to save the game?
[117:04.62]No.
[117:06.56]What am I playing this on?
[117:07.74]I'm playing this on a Wii.
[117:11.80]I have... That's going to keep happening, I think.
[117:16.04]I have a Wii, which is plugged in HD.
[117:20.62]And I'm using the original GameCube game, Chibi-Robo.
[117:25.55]And that is capturing through a capture card, which is being shown to you on the screen right now.
[117:36.12]Show the disc.
[117:36.90]I did yesterday.
[117:38.14]What's with this, like, I need to prove I did this yesterday?
[117:44.08]I did this exact thing yesterday.
[117:53.57]While I'm here...
[117:55.84]I want to get more of those demon doors.
[117:57.04]I have enough time to just fuck around out here.
[118:04.40]Let's go outside.
[118:04.98]I have plenty of battery.
[118:06.84]Let's go.
[118:12.02]Remember, you can't afford Chibi-Robo.
[118:13.58]What are you doing?
[118:16.20]Why?
[118:18.72]It's just like so... What does that even mean?
[118:22.78]Dude, what are you talking about?
[118:24.20]You can't even... You can't afford Chibi-Robo.
[118:30.16]Garrett?
[118:30.50]Oh, I gotta throw my trash away.
[118:33.44]It's a dead frog!
[118:34.54]Oh no!
[118:39.00]Oh no!
[118:40.18]Ribbit, ribbit!
[118:41.25]Wheeze!
[118:42.61]We need frog medicine.
[118:43.93]He's all dehydrated and shriveled.
[118:48.12]It hasn't rained lately and it looks like she's really weak.
[118:50.70]This is so distressing.
[118:52.32]We have to get her some water.
[119:04.16]Mug into the sink with water?
[119:25.96]Is there a hose out here?
[119:34.50]Stop cleaning.
[119:35.22]She's dead.
[119:35.74]I need... I don't know where to get water.
[119:38.52]Oh, I saved an ant.
[119:45.26]Wait, there's water right here.
[119:48.94]How do I open this?
[119:50.28]That's like a water symbol, right?
[119:58.72]Ground pound?
[120:15.67]Hit the tap in the kitchen?
[120:21.29]Or is there a hose?
[120:22.69]Oh, no, I think it's just a weird symbol.
[120:26.36]Ooh!
[120:31.30]Is there a hose out here?
[120:33.56]I got a decent amount of money.
[120:43.99]Is there a hose out here?
[120:46.65]You'd think there might be.
[120:47.25]I mean, can I get up this?
[120:50.13]Climb a tree?
[120:51.21]Wait.
[120:52.37]Let's go on and clean this shit up.
[121:03.19]Hose.
[121:04.03]Water.
[121:04.55]Some kind of water hose.
[121:06.37]Over here?
[121:13.15]What can I do with the A on this?
[121:20.94]What is that?
[121:22.00]Uh, it doesn't do anything.
[121:29.22]Well, we'll see you tomorrow, frog.
[121:31.45]Dead.
[121:31.57]The frog's gonna be fine.
[121:32.23]Good morning.
[121:32.55]Suggest you're happy for me.
[121:50.90]Your chibi ranking has gone from... That's a lot, actually.
[121:59.07]93 more happy.
[122:03.07]Hooray!
[122:15.81]If you see a sunshine sticker, I suggest you pop it with your chibi blaster.
[122:21.23]Try using your TV vision as a scope.
[122:23.70]I know that already.
[122:24.86]Would you like to save?
[122:26.66]Yes, I would.
[122:27.24]I also want to try this.
[122:28.58]I want to try this.
[122:31.44]Give me one second while I do this.
[122:37.73]Let me see if I can... I think it's just the way that it's being fed through.
[122:44.97]Ladies and gentlemen, I just fixed it.
[122:47.70]It's been fixed.
[122:49.00]I just fixed it.
[122:50.58]You should not hear any more cracking or popping ever again.
[122:53.66]It's been fixed.
[122:54.24]Thank you for the applause.
[123:07.05]I hope I did fix it.
[123:08.97]Let's see if I can prove it.
[123:19.72]He said that last time, too.
[123:21.54]No, no, this actually should work.
[123:25.28]Let's see.
[123:27.74]Because through my capture device, I could see it peaking when I just pulled it up.
[123:34.03]It should no longer be peaking on my capture device, which means I'm going to artificially inflate the sound like this.
[123:40.47]So I've artificially inflated the sound.
[123:47.00]And I have dropped the actual input.
[123:49.44]We'll find out.
[123:57.91]You tell me if you still hear it.
[123:59.75]Alright.
[124:00.39]I have the... Let's put the dog tags on.
[124:04.65]Right?
[124:05.35]Or do I just own them?
[124:08.77]I think I just own them, right?
[124:14.82]Crackling sound made it more authentic.
[124:21.20]let's go to the fort I now have I have a dog text I would clean this up but I I mean I can't leave a mess I told you this and you wonder why I can't play luigi's mansion 3.
[124:50.57]Because it sucks?
[124:51.61]No, because I suck up everything.
[124:53.96]I suck up everything.
[125:03.38]It's bad.
[125:11.32]Okay.
[125:12.57]I have dog tags.
[125:13.61]Unauthorized intruder.
[125:15.27]Don't let him pass.
[125:17.65]Take him out.
[125:18.19]What?
[125:20.82]Keep your rubble.
[125:21.24]This isn't good.
[125:22.32]Yes.
[125:22.54]It's going to be really hard to get over there.
[125:26.42]These rangers mean business.
[125:27.45]The only way to find something you can use to cover yourself.
[125:31.01]Well, I can... Haha.
[125:38.17]Haha.
[125:40.17]Alright, where am I going?
[125:46.54]Where does it want me to go?
[125:51.05]In the basement?
[125:55.30]Does this thing have infinite health?
[125:57.30]Is it going to break?
[125:58.22]How do I get to the basement?
[125:59.94]Over here?
[126:11.13]Son of a battle tank.
[126:17.17]Well, I guess he didn't look like an enemy.
[126:20.68]Come to think of it, he may be an ally.
[126:23.96]But still, my men were just pitiful.
[126:27.34]TV Robo.
[126:31.57]I can't believe my electronic eyes.
[126:33.33]That was truly amazing.
[126:34.45]You ran through those fearsome free ranges without getting shot.
[126:37.95]You really are superb.
[126:41.28]Of course, I was able to fly right over them.
[126:47.06]Uh-oh.
[126:48.55]Larry David just said something potentially controversial.
[126:52.55]That strange sound seems to have come from here.
[126:57.93]Between you and me, I'm a little scared, but I think we'd better go investigate.
[127:00.67]Okay.
[127:10.15]Uh, is there any outlets in the basement?
[127:22.72]Staircase.
[127:24.68]Oh, man.
[127:25.85]Easy.
[127:27.21]Easy.
[127:27.57]Alright, push it off.
[127:30.97]To get the goods inside.
[127:33.97]Oops.
[127:34.27]Can I get back up?
[127:44.44]Five happy points.
[127:45.14]Nice.
[127:45.34]Okay.
[127:45.54]Wait, what?
[127:46.42]There's something up here.
[127:49.00]Crash.
[127:54.08]I gotta go to a wastebasket.
[127:55.16]I probably have a lot of stuff here.
[127:56.14]I haven't done it in a while.
[128:02.05]Alright, cool.
[128:04.17]Wow.
[128:07.05]Look at all this trash.
[128:09.23]It's so much of it.
[128:11.57]Empty bottle.
[128:12.26]Broken bottle.
[128:25.89]Alright, there's gotta be an outlet down here.
[128:27.60]Everybody has outlets in their basements.
[128:30.18]How the fuck does your laundry machine not... You know what I'm saying?
[128:34.14]Alright, where is it?
[128:39.32]Yeah, there's an outlet right across the way.
[128:40.94]Alright, we're good.
[128:42.84]Where is it?
[128:43.28]Just so I can make sure I know where it is.
[128:44.42]Alright, clean this up.
[128:51.54]It's a tough mess.
[128:52.74]Do I upgrade the toothbrush at any time?
[128:59.85]Alright, mess contained.
[129:04.17]Any more?
[129:04.46]Yeah.
[129:05.14]Oil over here.
[129:08.46]Nice.
[129:16.81]Alright.
[129:17.57]Wait.
[129:18.51]I know, I know.
[129:19.05]I'll be fine.
[129:19.45]There's a little bit more oil over here.
[129:24.29]Ooh, cleaning bonus.
[129:30.70]Whoa, that was loud and crackling.
[129:40.79]Well, I think it's just the way that the Wii plays the GameCube game, because, I mean, this is not like there's anything weird going on here. ...
[130:02.90]Bad emulation.
[130:03.98]Good emulator.
[130:04.74]Need to update the emulator.
[130:07.33]There's no updating emulator.
[130:17.05]I mean, I thought it was fixed.
[130:20.72]I looked over at my gacha software and it was blowing out into the red.
[130:24.34]I guess not.
[130:29.00]I can power this person.
[130:29.94]I know, I gotta clean this shit up.
[130:36.58]I think it might be the memory card.
[130:39.48]Can I power him on?
[130:59.65]It's probably like a boss fight.
[131:00.65]I'm not doing this yet.
[131:01.29]How were the tacos last night?
[131:04.47]They were fucking incredible.
[131:10.33]Alright, well let's blast this.
[131:11.25]I had a range?
[131:19.72]Really?
[132:04.08]Fully charged.
[132:05.02]This is a Half-Life puzzle.
[132:11.24]Alright, let's turn this guy on and hopefully not blow out everybody's speakers.
[132:15.20]With the loud crackling noises that the original GameCube disc in the original Wii does.
[132:20.14]Turn the volume down maybe a little bit?
[132:39.31]That's part of the game.
[132:42.57]Chibi-Robo!
[132:45.70]Are you alright?
[132:46.42]Uh, I think so.
[132:51.16]Stop fooling around.
[132:51.96]Come on, this place gives me the creeps.
[132:57.51]Hurry and get out of here.
[133:00.25]Huh?
[133:00.41]Oh.
[133:01.09]Your eyes.
[133:01.43]You fried his circuit.
[133:02.83]No.
[133:18.81]Chibi-Robo!
[133:23.69]Don't die, no.
[133:24.47]What the fuck is going on?
[133:32.06]Am I going through, like, robot?
[133:35.24]Is this me and my family?
[133:36.50]Wait, I've downloaded all his memories.
[133:43.76]This guy's huge.
[133:57.35]Emulator virus.
[134:10.70]But then they powered him down because he ran out of battery.
[134:19.97]What's he doing?
[134:20.87]Was he catching?
[134:22.79]Did he throw a frisbee at him too hard?
[134:32.10]Wait, he got beamed up?
[134:39.37]$100,000 to fix?
[134:43.47]Too much money to fix.
[134:46.63]Too expensive.
[134:47.43]That's so sad.
[134:48.67]We can make that money.
[134:50.01]That's the whole game.
[134:55.04]Too much electric bill.
[134:56.40]Maybe Robo.
[134:57.28]You died.
[134:58.98]Huh?
[135:19.91]Ah!
[135:21.43]What phone call for Telly?
[135:23.17]Gotta go!
[135:24.21]Wait, he's gonna dip out like that, Telly?
[135:32.31]So he just gave birth.
[135:33.13]I can't believe he can move after all this time.
[135:37.39]I wonder what this might be.
[135:52.25]More importantly.
[135:54.63]Chibi-Robo.
[136:01.61]We were just getting... Can you cry into the mug?
[136:05.24]And dump it in the frog's mouth?
[136:07.68]We were just getting used to this house.
[136:10.42]And now you die and leave me all alone.
[136:15.08]Alone.
[136:18.96]Alone.
[136:19.80]No, alone.
[136:20.52]Alone.
[136:26.56]This took a really sad turn.
[136:28.78]I was just cleaning stuff with a toothbrush.
[136:40.50]I'm fine, see?
[136:42.86]Oh, you're alive.
[136:46.19]I'm so glad, Chibi-Robo.
[136:47.33]I thought you'd kick the bucket.
[136:51.63]I suppose I shouldn't have worried.
[136:54.94]I was going to fix you no matter what, even if I had to use my own parts.
[136:58.04]What a true friend.
[137:00.52]So tell me, did you dream?
[137:01.86]Yes.
[137:05.89]You didn't dream, right?
[137:06.93]I just said I did.
[137:07.63]It's quite possible that you downloaded data from GigaRobo's memory banks.
[137:14.97]Phew, all this excitement is really talking me out.
[137:17.86]See you later, ChibiRobo.
[137:22.61]This is Giga Robo and Chibi-Robo.
[137:28.14]Giga.
[137:34.60]Alright, well let's pick up the... This thing.
[137:46.59]Giga Battery.
[137:50.70]Chibi-Robo, wow, that's a...
[137:53.58]What is it?
[137:56.46]If ye plan to take that battery, I'd thank ye to charge it up and bring it back in one piece.
[138:15.22]Yar.
[138:19.33]And yet, that's not what ye want, is it?
[138:21.75]Ye colossal matey.
[138:25.92]Gino.
[138:26.88]It's fat Gino.
[138:28.60]This is where he's been the whole time.
[138:33.04]This is where he's been.
[138:33.96]They've kept him in a basement.
[138:36.72]He growed all his hair.
[138:39.38]Yar, if only you could speak to me, Giga-Robo.
[138:43.03]What?
[138:44.15]Is that really a Giga-Robo?
[138:48.75]Is he dead?
[138:52.83]Robots don't die, you flying boy.
[138:56.18]Shut your blowhole!
[139:00.62]You think you're smart, but you know nothing about him.
[139:28.65]I'm so sorry.
[139:30.85]Anyway, thank you very much.
[139:33.39]If you'll excuse me.
[139:35.62]Furl your sails, matey.
[139:39.90]You can't go anywhere yet.
[139:42.36]Jerma has an opportunity to do an Irish pirate guy.
[139:46.22]He's gonna build this all stream.
[139:48.48]Yar!
[139:50.44]You come blowin' in here like a summer squall and leave without introducin' yourselves.
[139:57.48]I'm sorry Uh, my name is Telly And that over there is Chibi-Robo Don't mind him, he doesn't talk much And who might you be?
[140:12.43]It's about time, yes
[140:24.10]The name's Captain Catbuke.
[140:25.92]I'm the scourge of the seven seas, the overlord of the oceans blue.
[140:31.04]The king of all pirates.
[140:34.96]Captain Plankbeard.
[140:40.06]You're a pirate?
[140:44.13]Hey, world is how it used to be.
[140:47.75]Now I'm nothing more than a shipless landlubber.
[140:52.15]Oh, how did you lose your ship?
[140:54.42]Oh, give me that!
[141:16.38]What say ye?
[141:17.16]Will ye return someday and listen to me sad tale of woe?
[141:20.34]That's a... What a boring, shitty pirate character.
[141:23.28]I love the taste of water.
[141:24.47]Oh, I'm just sold.
[141:27.51]Look at me.
[141:27.93]I've got me ship and... Oh, I love water.
[141:30.39]Hydrate, kids.
[141:35.25]There's supposed to be rum in there.
[141:36.35]There's supposed to be something in there with like three X's on it.
[141:43.42]I promise.
[141:45.32]Garh.
[141:47.79]Never make a promise you can't keep.
[141:49.99]That's the pirate's code.
[141:53.85]It's a bugle fairy voice.
[142:00.12]You do well to remember me words, you evergrown piece of plankton.
[142:04.78]Okay.
[142:07.40]I won't forget them.
[142:08.09]Even if I die, I'll come back and remember them.
[142:11.51]What did I tell you?
[142:12.47]Robots don't die, and you don't get a scar if they neither.
[142:17.32]You're right.
[142:19.44]That giga battery is no good by its lonesome.
[142:23.26]You need to search the house and find the giga charger.
[142:33.51]That was scary.
[142:34.19]Anyways, let's go back.
[142:36.91]Need to plug it in to a Tesla battery charger.
[142:40.14]Alright, give me that water though.
[142:43.46]He loves water.
[142:44.32]Give me that water.
[142:45.10]I want your water.
[142:47.99]Nice.
[142:48.29]Ah, yes.
[142:49.19]Okay.
[142:49.31]I can't get the water?
[142:49.99]He loves water.
[142:51.19]I need water.
[142:51.73]Alright, can I do this now?
[142:52.51]Am I allowed to do this now?
[143:19.94]Did we get coxed?
[143:20.98]Are we still alive?
[143:23.04]What are you talking about?
[143:26.06]I'm alive.
[143:26.40]I haven't dropped any frames.
[143:28.20]What are you talking about?
[143:32.61]I haven't dropped any frames.
[143:34.41]I have zero dropped frames.
[143:35.45]Maybe it's a Twitch problem?
[143:36.71]I don't know.
[143:38.73]Looks like it's about to snap.
[143:39.71]I tried this before.
[143:40.37]Come on, let me get it.
[143:51.66]Nice.
[143:52.08]I love it.
[143:53.24]Okay.

[145:02.83]Appreciate the 20 fucking subs, dude.
[145:08.81]Thank you.
[145:13.01]Average A... I'm not even gonna respond to that.
[145:17.75]That's a lot of subs, though.
[145:18.75]Thanks for the subs.
[145:21.00]Jermas.
[145:22.42]Uh, by the way, it's not Average.
[145:24.44]It's Jermas Average Dong.
[145:29.80]Average is misspelled.
[145:33.85]Now let's float over there.
[145:40.59]Do I have enough power for this, right?
[145:44.12]Let's put this for coins and shit.
[145:48.05]Ooh, wait, okay.
[145:49.50]Um... Alright, we're gonna... I need a better camera.
[145:55.08]I'm gonna float into the cage.
[146:02.93]What the fuck was that?
[146:07.93]Alright.
[146:09.85]What are you doing, Chibi?
[146:13.60]It's a dangerous game you'll be playing.
[146:15.76]Yarrr, what be this?
[146:17.82]Oh, there's a door up there.
[146:22.34]Alright, I'm running out of... Alright, put this away.

[146:52.08]Alright, hold on.
[146:54.62]Can I... Give me first person.
[147:01.95]There's a frog ring there.
[147:03.15]I don't think I can make that, though.
[147:07.61]Giga charger.
[147:08.51]Alright, but... Can I float from here to there?
[147:11.77]I don't think I can fly from here to there.
[147:17.30]That seems like a long way.
[147:22.32]Just climb it?
[147:24.52]Can I climb it?
[147:25.20]Climb from the other side?
[147:34.06]Hold on, let me just get down here.
[147:36.98]Another 10 community subs from Jerma's average dong.
[147:41.71]I need battery before I do any of this shit.

[147:50.25]Oh, God!
[147:51.53]Oh, God!

[148:18.55]Jerma's average dick.
[148:19.69]Jerma sucks.
[148:20.35]Jerma sucks too.
[148:21.53]Jerma lied about how big his dick was.
[148:23.56]How many of these do we have?
[148:27.74]How many?
[148:28.54]Like, there's a hundred of these.
[148:33.15]So many.
[148:34.41]Alright, climb up from here.
[148:39.23]Not enough.
[148:40.95]Can I climb this?
[148:41.81]There's gotta be a way up there.
[148:50.95]Let me see.
[148:51.31]Oh, how do I get up there?
[149:09.61]I can go from here.
[149:10.51]But how do I get up there?
[149:14.43]Can I float from one of these steps over there?
[149:17.25]The swing you were on.
[149:22.31]Can I get it from there?
[149:23.07]From where you were?
[149:24.51]I think it might be too far, yeah.
[149:44.18]There's a bunch of bird shit in here.
[149:45.18]Hold on.
[149:59.44]Okay.
[150:00.20]So from here... You're saying you think I can make it from here?
[150:06.77]I doubt it.
[150:11.61]Oh, I doubt it.
[150:12.57]I don't think I can go from here to there.
[150:16.82]Can I climb?
[150:17.28]I'm going to climb up.
[150:18.30]Oh, I can climb up this fucking thing.
[150:22.78]Oh, man.
[150:23.58]Nice.
[150:25.26]Alright.
[150:25.70]Hold on.
[150:26.38]I got... We're going to come back.
[150:28.62]I need to move this.
[150:30.41]Put this away.
[150:32.91]It's wasting battery.
[150:34.79]Turn over the rope.
[150:35.27]Turn over the rope.
[150:36.49]I know.
[150:36.71]I know.
[150:36.91]I know.
[150:37.15]Don't worry.
[150:38.21]I went up.
[150:38.91]Alright.
[150:39.65]I'm going to... Oh, there's a demon door.
[150:42.55]What?
[150:42.83]I can't push this anymore?
[150:43.67]Why not?
[150:43.85]Turn over the rope.
[150:45.41]Turn over the rope.
[150:45.86]Turn over the rope.
[150:51.82]I want to push this the other- Why can't I push this anymore?
[150:53.62]Alright, it's not important right now.
[150:57.32]The demon door is important.
[151:05.20]Now don't- I'm gonna wa- That's a waste.
[151:06.59]Watch out for the bird shit.
[151:11.51]And I'm gonna float down.
[151:19.73]Money.
[151:20.17]Big money.
[151:22.32]Alright, now we float.
[151:23.96]We float from here.
[151:25.38]Okay, there's another demon door right there.
[151:27.66]Is there a plug?
[151:28.60]Alright, there's a plug right underneath me.
[151:33.10]Literally, and I use that word actually literally.
[151:35.56]There's a plug right underneath me.
[151:45.09]Okay, this way.
[151:46.31]Get the frog coin.
[151:52.18]Blow it down again Okay Monkey
[152:22.96]I mean, I didn't think it was going to take that much power to float down.
[152:27.20]I thought it went to zero.
[152:30.72]Alright, I'm not done in here.
[152:33.92]I want to get up the rope.
[152:36.42]I'm going to open that demon door. ...
[152:58.99]Same deal.
[152:59.39]Climb up.
[153:05.73]What about the nails?
[153:07.94]Is this trash?
[153:10.04]Or is this a block?
[153:11.32]I can probably float around it, but not yet.
[153:12.66]I want to get this demon door.
[153:28.49]Paid it.
[153:28.97]Okay.
[153:29.73]Put it away.
[153:31.23]Open.
[153:31.77]Alright, I've got two grand.
[153:44.45]That's a lot of money.
[153:45.17]I'm almost out of time, but can I go up here?
[153:47.14]Is anything else up here?
[153:54.12]I guess I can just go back.
[153:55.82]Wait, is it enough time to go get the...
[153:59.89]I don't think there is.
[154:02.52]It's okay.
[154:05.46]It's about to turn off anyway.
[154:10.24]Save the frog.
[154:11.70]I gotta come back here tomorrow.
[154:13.48]This is the plan.
[154:14.04]Come back here tomorrow and get the giga charger.
[154:17.47]You could have made it in MonkaS.
[154:19.27]I don't think I'm gonna... Save the frog.
[154:21.41]The frog will be fine.
[154:24.83]Am I gonna save?
[154:26.55]Of course I am.
[154:31.06]Do I have enough time to get it now?
[154:33.10]Maybe.
[154:35.38]Let's go, Chibi-Robo.
[154:39.33]The frog will die.
[154:40.83]The frog is not going to die.
[154:42.61]This is a children's game.
[155:00.47]Same deal.
[155:05.82]Put it away.
[155:06.32]Up.
[155:11.06]Do I have enough time?
[155:13.86]Okay, float around here.
[155:15.94]Oh, that didn't work.
[155:20.37]That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work.
[155:22.27]I thought I could float around it.
[155:23.09]Ah, we'll come back tomorrow.
[155:23.93]Whatever.
[155:24.17]See you tomorrow.
[155:37.59]That's the start of the stream.
[155:38.45]Sorry.
[155:38.57]The other one.
[155:42.85]Nooo!
[155:49.85]Time sure flies when you're making folks happy.
[155:55.85]Back to the Chibi house.
[156:01.14]Great work out there. Download.
[156:11.14]I'm in top 1,000.
[156:12.78]I'm making it into the top 1,000.
[156:13.84]CitrusSoft has sent you a special gift, a brand new bonus battery.
[156:17.58]Ooh, that's a lot.
[156:22.92]Now let's spend some money.
[156:28.04]We should do a happiness calculation every stream.
[156:43.18]Top 1000 Chibi-Robo stream.
[156:46.18]It's Giga Robo who is making that noise.
[156:52.02]You might not know it, but Giga Robo is the brainchild of the legendary engineer Dr. Joy Ebisu of Citrusoft.
[156:58.94]He made you too.
[157:02.08]Even though he designed both you, Giga Robo is ten times bigger than you are.
[157:08.30]He's a hundred times heavier.
[157:11.35]Sad to see something like this happen tossed aside like so much trash.
[157:13.77]Poor guy.
[157:38.17]Enough moping around.
[157:38.85]We've got work to do.
[157:39.89]Let's go earn us some happy points.
[157:41.23]Every time you talk, my ears pop.
[157:44.06]How do we get you to stop talking?
[157:46.84]Just take out the gigabattery you're carrying with you!
[157:48.64]Hey, that's it.
[157:56.22]Look at that.
[157:56.62]It's already bigger than you are, Chibi-Robo.
[158:00.66]Pretty heavy.
[158:01.13]Let's set it over there.
[158:02.09]Emulator noises.
[158:20.52]If you want to recharge that giga battery, you'll need to find a giga charger.
[158:24.56]There's got to be one around here somewhere.
[158:25.98]I know where it is.
[158:26.80]You and I both looked at it at the same time.
[158:28.08]Alright, let's get this out.
[158:49.41]Okay, online shop.
[158:51.75]Charged chip.
[158:54.12]Chibi battery.
[158:55.40]Range chip.
[158:56.48]Hot rod.
[158:57.28]Space scrambler.
[158:58.36]That's a charged chip.
[159:01.06]Enables the chibi blaster to fire a charged shot.
[159:05.08]Pretty good.
[159:05.44]Chibi battery.
[159:06.82]Chibi robot with spare battery.
[159:09.27]Yep.
[159:12.51]Range chip.
[159:13.51]Enables the chibi blaster to fire long distances.
[159:19.76]Nectar flower seed?
[159:20.88]A cute nectar flower will grow from this seed.
[159:26.37]Charge shot.
[159:27.57]Alright, I'll get it.
[159:28.15]Still don't have enough money for any of this.
[159:37.38]Thank you for your visit.
[159:44.36]Charge chip.
[159:51.20]Chibi battery.
[159:54.86]Whoa.
[159:55.76]Chibi drugs.
[159:59.24]You've upgraded.
[160:02.36]Let's go.
[160:02.70]Let's save it.
[160:11.79]Back to the downstairs.
[160:13.25]I want to get that charger.
[160:26.48]Put the trash away, yep.
[160:28.56]Clean up the confetti, can I?
[160:29.68]I don't think I can.
[160:32.24]Oh, I can.
[160:37.23]But why are you throwing trash everywhere?
[160:41.25]Is this trash?
[160:43.49]Wow.
[160:45.01]This is where your utility bots come from.
[160:46.97]They're your backup buddies, your support bots.
[160:49.71]If you have scrap, we can make some utility bots with the cheapy PC.
[160:52.43]Think there's any scrap in this place?
[160:54.98]Okay, so that's where I put the scrap.
[160:57.04]Alright, let's go.
[161:00.14]Save frog, you monster.
[161:02.72]I'm on it.
[161:04.22]Soon.
[161:04.48]I need a waste basket.
[161:09.38]Okay, what do you guys say?
[161:11.49]You guys say trash barrel, waste basket, trash can.
[161:16.39]What do you guys say?
[161:25.97]I say trash can.
[161:28.01]Trash can.
[161:29.41]Or just the trash.
[161:31.39]Throw it in the trash.
[161:40.53]Speaking of which.
[161:43.01]There we go.
[161:44.89]Two bottles.
[161:46.73]Ooh!
[161:48.93]Look at all that.
[161:49.39]More broken glass.
[162:02.88]That's a lot.
[162:03.40]You got a total of 86 happy points.
[162:05.34]Holy shit.
[162:07.80]If your robot doesn't recycle.
[162:13.50]Is that demon door?
[162:14.68]No, let's get that demon door open.
[162:16.06]Okay.
[162:44.37]I bet Chibi throws his car batteries in the ocean.
[162:52.44]What the fuck?
[162:57.82]Why?
[163:01.14]No!
[163:02.30]No!
[163:03.16]I didn't make it!
[163:03.94]No!
[163:06.63]Unbelievable!
[163:08.05]Unbelievable!
[163:16.21]Alright, let's get a... let's plug in.
[163:27.55]It's illegal and free.
[163:28.78]Throw batteries in the ocean.
[163:31.86]You are fucking crazy.
[163:33.88]What is wrong with you?
[163:37.44]No, I didn't even save the damn thing!
[163:40.37]Save it!
[163:41.95]Hey!
[163:48.27]Oh, based.
[163:51.59]Shut up.
[163:52.91]Oh, based.
[163:53.89]Throw your batteries in the ocean.
[164:09.46]Two hours and 40 minutes.
[164:10.74]What?
[164:11.50]Time flies when you're cleaning up dirt.
[164:18.89]Fucking pollutants.
[164:21.01]Ooh, I still like... I still like, um... I can, like, get up there.
[164:25.73]I think... I think there's, like, a... There could be, like, a ladder I can, like... Probably, like, get on or something.

[164:34.83]Or, like, go from here.
[164:35.81]Alright, back to the basement.
[164:49.39]Oh, is that a tuber?
[164:52.03]Me saying like a bunch of times is a tuber?
[164:54.45]People do that?
[164:59.15]E3 presenter?
[165:03.78]Uh-oh.

[166:33.58]I missed one.
[166:40.17]It's the first Monka.
[166:43.29]What are you talking about?
[166:55.24]We've made it all the way to MonkaS.
[166:56.94]Does he have anything to say?
[167:04.80]Private Frisco on duty, sir.
[167:07.00]We can't train when the family is around.
[167:09.34]Okay.

[167:26.35]What is MonkaS?
[167:28.83]Frog face going, fuck.
[167:38.34]The soldiers remind me of you because you look like an egg.
[167:42.34]Not even, not even close.
[167:46.94]Not even, not even close.
[167:49.40]I mean, I'm talking not even 1% close.
[167:53.69]I couldn't be more incorrect.
[168:02.98]We're just talking facts here.
[168:03.92]Alright, there's a photo.
[168:06.25]Free ranger's photo.
[168:08.37]Cool.
[168:10.19]Um, why not get up here?
[168:14.71]Shit, I need like a springboard.
[168:16.29]There's definitely going to be a springboard.
[168:17.57]There has to be.
[168:21.47]Alright, let's go see what
[168:33.02]Doesn't matter.
[168:33.40]Pick me up.
[168:40.85]Ribbit.
[168:45.73]Hello, bit.
[168:48.41]Jenny, what are you doing up?
[168:51.43]Go back to your room and go to sleep.
[168:54.44]Uh, ribbit, oh.
[168:58.72]Night, ribbit.
[169:04.24]I know you're always there.
[169:06.50]It freaks me out.
[169:33.28]Okay.
[169:34.26]Back to the basement.
[169:40.55]Back to the basement.
[169:41.17]I want that, uh, that charger.
[169:45.89]He's the cameraman.
[169:46.63]Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like Lucky 2.
[170:03.36]Ooh, wait.
[170:05.16]There's coins that I didn't get.
[170:07.86]How did I not get that?
[170:08.86]Nice.
[170:10.10]I want to push this off.
[170:22.51]Free happy points.
[170:23.27]Take it.
[170:23.55]I have to pee.
[170:28.29]We can take a bathroom break here.
[170:31.80]Just a moment.
[170:37.49]Okay.
[170:44.57]Now I'm ready to get the supercharger.
[170:46.67]Just pee into my streamer diaper.
[171:06.73]They start advertising, like Nvidia starts making diapers for gamers.
[171:12.63]They're all branded, they're black and green and shit.
[171:18.71]Play your foolish chatter.
[171:23.26]You're a cheatin' lion demon crab.
[171:27.54]Cheating, how rude!
[171:29.38]You fail because your soul has not been properly cleansed.
[171:33.72]Do you take me for a brainless piece of kelp?
[171:37.34]I know ye decide whether your eye opens or closes, ye filthy bilge rat.
[171:43.57]That is untrue.
[171:44.25]A person with a pure soul would be able to see this clearly.
[171:49.81]Me soul's as clean as the waters of Shanty Pete's Blessed Harbor.
[171:54.89]Yar, one more time, ye scurvy scum.
[172:01.24]There's no way the King of Pirates is losing to some half-baked sea cucumber.
[172:08.34]Ooh, gambling is in the game.
[172:09.99]And there's a casino here, and... Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[172:12.31]Get on with it, you scallywag!
[172:15.95]How frightening.
[172:18.77]Very well, I shall begin.
[172:21.85]Everything is nothing.
[172:31.20]Reach out with your soul.
[172:32.70]Feel.
[172:34.47]Let it flow to my right eye?
[172:39.33]Will it open?
[172:41.07]Or will it remain closed?
[172:48.28]What do you feel?
[172:50.00]Will it open?
[172:52.68]Yar!
[172:54.84]last time it was your port side people and the time before that starboard here you shall open the eyes says I are you certain wait he can just open it whenever he wants what certain as the tides do even flow it'll open I tell you you're with me ain't you
[173:24.77]Yes.
[173:27.94]Ah, of course you are.
[173:31.42]Are you certain?
[173:33.70]You are me pirate's words as good as me gold.
[173:37.89]Very well.
[173:55.89]Nooo!
[174:00.00]It opened!
[174:00.64]Yar, it opened, I tell you!
[174:03.42]Put it to your left eye!
[174:11.52]How unfortunate.
[174:13.98]Don't play dumb, you miserable lifeboat leech.
[174:17.39]You're nothing but a liar and a thief.
[174:19.55]There was a wink on screen already!
[174:25.78]Great Pico, Great Cheeto is more like it.
[174:29.00]I'll have you clapped in irons and keel-hauled.
[174:34.76]You're lucky I'm without me ship, you great blinkin' sea slug.
[174:38.04]I've had me fill of you.
[174:39.38]Is there actually a wink?
[174:49.01]Alright, well, my turn.
[174:54.13]Another sucker.
[174:55.86]I mean, oh, dear me, your soul is unclean.
[174:59.94]Will you cleanse your soul?
[175:00.92]Sure.
[175:06.31]Your desire to achieve enlightenment is quite admirable.
[175:12.44]Mula corrupts the soul.
[175:13.50]But if you use your mula, then your soul is gradually purified.
[175:20.37]Now then, allow me to take your moolah as ablution for your dirty soul.
[175:26.01]Alright, $10.
[175:26.77]Let the cleansing begin.
[175:29.90]By repeating this process, your moolah will be purified and returned to you in time.
[175:33.44]This is the one true way to abandon worldly desires and become one with a higher plane.
[175:39.85]You have 1628.
[175:40.17]How much would you like to purify?
[175:55.21]100 bucks!
[175:59.09]Let us begin the process of cleansing your moolah and your soul.
[176:01.49]Everything is nothing.
[176:05.40]Entrapment is release.
[176:06.06]Abandonment is friendship.
[176:06.72]It worked!
[176:22.34]The cosmos embraces you with love.
[176:26.36]Let your doubts and fears melt away.
[176:32.10]Doubt corrupts the soul.
[176:34.92]Release, release your moolah.
[176:39.91]We return to a new beginning.
[176:45.09]Do not let your lack of experience make you nervous.
[176:50.91]If you are nervous, then I too am nervous.
[176:57.44]Let us begin, O wanderer.
[177:02.54]Reach with your soul, feel with your soul.
[177:08.59]Let your soul flow to my right eye.
[177:13.21]Will it open or will it remain shut?
[177:21.59]One whose soul is clean will be able to see the answer with certainty.
[177:30.92]Well?
[177:33.10]Will my eye open?
[177:37.75]Okay, what if I say no and then shoot him in the eye?
[177:40.77]It'll have to be closed.
[177:52.55]No, it's not going to open.
[177:57.57]You believe it will remain closed?
[178:00.99]Yes.
[178:02.55]I am ready.
[178:05.25]Please do not be staring at me so much.
[178:08.65]You will disrupt the cosmic balance.
[178:11.73]And now.
[178:32.69]Closed.
[178:37.04]Closed!
[178:38.24]It's closed!
[178:39.80]Closed!
[178:44.84]You are correct.
[178:45.46]Oh, wait, no, this is the classic scam.
[178:47.86]Classic scam.
[178:50.54]You win one or two times in a row, and then the scam starts.
[178:54.17]And then you're like, holy shit, I just won 10, I won 100 bucks.
[178:58.65]I can do that again, and you do 500, and then the scam starts.
[179:05.13]Any women alike will rejoice in the presence of your soul.
[179:08.43]You have gained $200.
[179:09.13]I should have went all in.
[179:13.20]Your noble intentions and trusting soul have birthed a miracle.
[179:17.28]I must spread word of this miracle.
[179:18.64]I must share this joy with others.
[179:21.08]Will you continue to cleanse?
[179:24.20]Nope.
[179:25.34]I'm out.
[179:25.90]See you later.
[179:27.68]Oh my, this is not part of the plan.
[179:28.89]You're gonna stop?
[179:30.69]How unfortunate.
[179:32.98]Kabula and Sol have been cleansed and now are returned to you.
[179:37.11]Please come again.
[179:38.79]Whenever you are, close your eyes, please think of me.
[179:41.27]See ya.
[179:48.79]Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[179:49.63]I am gonna save, and I'm also gonna pee.
[180:08.58]Trying to scam a Vegas man.
[180:10.65]Good luck.
[180:12.69]Alright, I've wrote back.
[180:16.80]It's gonna be.
[180:18.36]You can listen to this music in the meantime.
[183:58.32]We love the music.
[184:00.06]It is pretty good.
[184:04.22]It's pretty good.
[184:04.76]It's got a nice little ring to it.
[184:11.90]Alright, let's go.
[184:15.00]Alright, I'm... Something's wrong with me.
[184:18.28]I thought that was a doorbell.
[184:19.22]I thought that somebody rang the doorbell.
[184:22.75]That was like a perfect do-do.
[184:24.89]Okay, whatever.
[184:28.83]Alright, what was I doing?
[184:29.75]Oh yeah, I was getting the giga charger.
[184:31.92]Okay, up.
[184:37.40]Over.
[184:38.96]Let's go, chibi.
[184:39.82]I have a question.
[184:45.45]Why is nobody making me apologize for saying the word chibi?
[184:49.91]You guys are okay with that one?
[184:52.27]You're okay with that one?
[185:03.62]That's fine?
[185:05.66]Okay.
[185:10.70]Did I just climb the rope?
[185:13.22]I know.
[185:13.46]I can't see!
[185:15.34]I can't see!
[185:22.19]He's not Kawaiirobo.
[185:34.62]Now I have to apologize.
[185:36.10]Now I have to apologize.
[185:37.94]I'm sorry.
[185:43.70]Now that crossed the line.
[185:44.88]Alright.
[185:49.78]Let's go over here.
[186:02.22]And then get the Giga Charger.
[186:03.94]Wait, this box is everywhere.
[186:05.38]Can I not push these off?
[186:09.17]How do I get this off?
[186:14.35]I can't push you off.
[186:22.16]Push these ones off.
[186:24.34]Shit.
[186:24.60]Alright, um, hold on.
[186:28.10]No, too much to do.
[186:29.38]Okay, I'm just gonna get the charger.
[186:30.58]Okay, okay, okay.
[186:35.68]Just push it.
[186:41.39]I can't get them.
[186:42.45]Well, it don't matter.
[186:43.85]Charge shot?
[186:54.02]Oh, fuck.
[186:54.60]Okay.
[187:00.68]Ooh, there's a can of soda.
[187:09.94]Empty can.
[187:10.58]Okay.
[187:10.88]Here it is.
[187:11.28]Let's see.
[187:11.68]Give me it.
[187:25.47]Giga Charger.
[187:30.69]Yes, that be it, says I. If you don't play more Viscera Cleanup Detail, I'm refunding the game.
[187:36.90]Uh... Alright.
[187:42.84]What does that have to do with me?
[187:45.30]Do you truly mean to send Giga Robo to Salem once more?
[187:48.50]Yes, I do.
[187:49.30]Let's turn him back on.
[187:52.52]Aw, Chibi.
[187:54.30]You're such a... Like, that's one thing for you to remember.
[188:04.89]Don't use the outlets in the house when you fill her up.
[188:10.49]You'll be drawing so much power, the poor Sandersons will go bankrupt.
[188:16.95]Causing the family hardship wouldn't sit well with Giga-Robo.
[188:26.47]Ain't that right?
[188:27.26]The giant can opener.
[188:31.16]This just sounds like a vomit sound effect.
[188:33.04]Somebody's just puking over and over again.
[188:35.06]I almost forgot.
[188:38.18]Gigarobo be missing a leg and no peg leg neither.
[188:50.74]If me memory serves, Captain Sanderson put it in a clear sort of treasure chest.
[188:57.05]Sort of a steel trunk with a handle.
[189:03.85]Okay.
[189:11.96]Let's float down.
[189:15.78]Don't run out of battery!
[189:33.22]got it your energy is fall are you going to save alright so I gotta go find his leg
[189:55.89]Is that it?
[189:56.23]I think I did everything I can do down here.
[189:58.51]I need a leg.
[189:59.11]My leg!
[190:26.05]Up.
[190:28.81]Up.
[190:39.23]Up.
[190:39.51]Out.
[190:39.91]Wait, what?
[190:40.81]What are you talking about?
[190:44.39]Didn't they just call me an ally?
[190:47.72]You incompetent fools.
[190:48.78]Aren't fit for egg salad.
[190:51.70]You disgrace the free rangers.
[190:53.24]Don't I have...
[190:59.27]If it were up to me, I'd say you should all be poached.
[191:02.21]Private Memphis would have been ashamed of you.
[191:05.02]Hey.
[191:09.68]Private Detroit, wake up.
[191:12.92]Listen up.
[191:15.58]I'm going to beat you eggs into a fearsome fighting omelet.
[191:19.07]And you'll thank me for it.
[191:21.21]Yes, sir.
[191:23.35]Alright, soldiers.
[191:24.21]What are the five free ranger rules?
[191:28.12]Revengers rule number one.
[191:29.50]When Sarge gives an order, privates say sir, yes sir.
[191:33.46]Rule number two.
[191:34.66]Leave no egg behind.
[191:37.10]Rule number three.
[191:38.64]Snooze on patrol, get thrown in the hole.
[191:42.08]Rule number four.
[191:43.48]Show up for roll call or suffer the consequences.
[191:46.85]Rule number five.
[191:48.27]Failure to follow orders is punishable by scrambling.
[191:50.45]Alright, never forget the five rules.
[191:59.30]Together we will defeat Tau.
[192:03.54]Go.
[192:05.68]Text Frisco, begin roll call.
[192:08.30]Yes, sir.
[192:15.05]Alright.
[192:20.61]Kitchen.
[192:20.97]Where do I want to go?
[192:23.53]I can't go up to the second floor.
[192:27.32]What do I have?
[192:31.63]I wonder if I should go over here?
[192:34.65]Save the frog.
[192:35.41]Save the frog.
[192:36.05]Save the frog.
[192:36.57]Should I just... I mean... Can I talk?
[192:50.15]Save the frog.
[192:50.87]I need water.
[192:51.51]Alright.
[192:55.81]Are you the robot that breached our perimeter?
[193:00.00]No.
[193:04.73]Roger.
[193:05.79]I've got nothing else to say to you.
[193:06.89]I think I want to go up.
[193:15.67]Can I go up?
[193:21.03]Alright, there's nothing over there.
[193:22.38]I can't really do anything.
[193:26.52]Red block.
[193:27.28]Can I climb something?
[193:30.30]I don't think so.
[193:31.08]Wait, can I climb that?
[193:36.63]Say yes.
[193:39.21]Why would I do that?
[193:42.91]Why would I say yes?
[193:44.39]Aren't they looking?
[193:44.93]They're trying to kill me.
[193:47.37]Are you the robot that breached the perimeter?
[193:49.25]Oh, yes I am.
[193:49.93]Then they're going to start firing at me.
[193:55.08]Give me a depth charge and call it a biscuit.
[193:58.34]Very impressive.
[193:59.02]Not bad for a pencil neck robot.
[194:01.38]Just don't...
[194:06.62]Let it go.
[194:07.60]I'm getting Tasmanian Devil vibes from this guy right now.
[194:12.71]Don't let it go to your scrap metal head.
[194:21.12]You aren't half the robot that GigaRobo was.
[194:23.04]Not even half of the half of the robot or half of that.
[194:29.40]Do a Tasmanian Devil impression?
[194:32.68]I don't... You... Okay.
[194:34.58]There is no Tasmanian Devil impression unless you go all fucking in.
[194:41.10]And I don't know if I'm prepared to go all in.
[194:43.28]A non-all-in impression of Tasmanian Devil is bad.
[194:49.99]And it's gonna be like... That wasn't... Come on, man.
[194:53.61]That sucked.
[194:54.67]That was a little... You gotta go fucking all in.
[195:00.52]Otherwise, it's... I don't think I... I don't know if I'm prepared to go all-in right now.
[195:12.36]It's like... It's fucking 100% all-in.
[195:16.26]Otherwise, it's not gonna... I don't think I can go all-in.
[195:28.46]I tried.
[195:28.88]I tried.
[195:29.66]I was close.
[195:31.32]I got... I was close.
[195:46.73]You can't... You have to go.
[195:48.49]You have to be standing and have your arms in the air and fucking go nuts.
[195:56.62]Otherwise, it's bad.
[195:58.08]And I fucked it up because I didn't even end up with the... So, I couldn't do it.
[196:07.98]I'm going far.
[196:08.88]You want me to go all in?
[196:15.53]I'll go all in.
[196:16.27]I'm going to stand up.
[196:37.70]Okay, I don't have like any close neighbors.
[196:40.04]That's like a- That's not even- I don't even know what that sound would be.
[196:49.38]That's like I'm in- I just got thrown into like a blender.
[197:03.74]Kim's probably like, what's going on?
[197:05.34]Outlast?
[197:10.71]What do you mean Outlast?
[197:17.41]Wink?
[197:21.97]I would never do that on camera.
[197:23.71]Doing a Tasmanian Devil impression on camera.
[197:29.20]No way.
[197:30.32]No way.
[197:30.66]That would be embarrassing.
[197:31.92]The word I'm looking for is embarrassing.
[197:35.64]An all-in Tasmanian Devil is impressive.
[197:38.94]Otherwise, it's embarrassing.
[197:40.76]And there's a very fine fucking line.
[197:43.60]I'm not even sure I hit it.
[197:44.58]Alright, what do I need to do?
[197:59.27]It was on the mark?
[198:00.61]Alright, good.
[198:12.66]I need water.
[198:13.92]Wait, I haven't been up there?
[198:17.33]Green screen request is to do that on, oh my god.
[198:20.85]That would be so fucking funny.
[198:26.05]I already see, I can already see the edits of me spinning around doing that and it being in like Looney Tunes cartoons.
[198:33.44]Alright, yeah, put it on, get it on the recommendation when I finally fucking do that.
[198:41.12]I'll spin around and shit.
[198:42.54]Oh, that'd be so stupid.
[198:43.62]Alright, I can't.
[198:46.16]Ooh.
[198:48.52]Can I make it?
[198:50.75]No.
[198:56.75]I need...
[199:11.67]Can I climb up here?
[199:12.51]I need water.
[199:16.37]Water.
[199:17.20]Actually, I can do it from here.
[199:25.34]I should be able to do it from here, right?
[199:26.52]All the way to the top?
[199:27.56]Get on the table?
[199:40.25]Drink?
[199:42.37]Okay.
[199:46.27]Uh, pretty good.
[199:51.82]Alright, so from here, I should be able to do it from here, right?
[199:56.16]Oh, no.
[199:56.44]I'm almost out of time.
[199:57.84]Um... Way to go!
[200:05.56]Call it a day.
[200:15.87]Remember, that was the poison cup.
[200:17.31]Somebody came in here and poisoned it.
[200:20.33]Ooh.
[200:20.47]700.
[200:20.49]I think I can buy another upgrade, too.
[200:46.80]Now just take out the Giga Charger you're carrying with you.
[200:51.72]That's it.
[200:52.08]Look at that.
[200:52.52]It's already bigger than you are, Achiever.
[200:54.10]I know.
[200:54.48]Everything's bigger than me.
[201:01.51]Oh.
[201:05.03]Let me guess.
[201:05.37]I have to pay money to fill this?
[201:13.47]Okay.
[201:15.71]And finally recharge the Giga Battery.
[201:17.79]While you're here, Chibi-Robo, would you like to save?
[201:19.95]I would.
[201:20.67]Okay, let's check it out.
[201:31.08]What's the deal?
[201:35.70]What does it take?
[201:37.72]Shell out the moolah.
[201:39.48]Looks like the Giga Battery doesn't have any energy stored up at all.
[201:43.28]Gonna take a whole lot of juice to charge that battery.
[201:46.94]Can't charge it from the outlets in the house.
[201:48.52]That would break the family's bank.
[201:50.14]Well, I'm getting paid from the family.
[201:55.26]So the more work... If I do extra work and get paid more money, it is their money.
[202:00.56]Do I want to charge it?
[202:03.26]Um, sure.
[202:05.96]A thousand kilowatts equals a thousand dollars.
[202:08.10]How many kilowatts will you charge?
[202:10.56]A thousand.
[202:22.57]Well, that's not very much.
[202:23.91]More, Chibi-Robo, more!
[202:25.40]Um... Okay.
[202:34.74]Welcome to the Chibi PC.
[202:43.29]I'm gonna get a Nectar Flower Seed.
[202:46.41]Okay, I have- Where do I plant the flowers?
[202:52.55]Sorry about that.
[202:59.16]My bad.
[202:59.50]Don't be sorry.
[203:02.50]Just don't do it anymore.
[203:12.64]Alright.
[203:13.80]We need water for the frog outside.
[203:19.28]Back to the kitchen.
[203:22.87]Should I talk to the girl again?
[203:23.77]Alright, let's talk to the girl.
[203:28.55]Anything else for us to do with the girl?
[203:32.91]Oh, she's drawing a picture of me.
[203:38.31]Ribbit.
[203:38.65]Gimme ribbit.
[203:40.91]Gimme?
[203:41.37]Gimme what?
[203:45.32]Oh, gimme.
[203:56.69]Gunpowder.
[204:00.01]Frog ring?
[204:00.67]You want this?
[204:09.56]Thanks, Ribbit.
[204:14.50]66 happy points, holy shit.
[204:15.92]Do it again?
[204:17.38]Eight more, Ribbit.
[204:18.06]Okay, here.
[204:28.02]No, I'll give you another present.
[204:33.75]She's demanding them.
[204:35.53]Thank you.
[204:36.89]Eight more.
[204:37.37]Alright.
[204:43.88]We need to go to the kitchen.
[204:51.83]Oh, did I give both?
[204:52.65]I gave both.
[204:58.89]We haven't even tested if this is synced up or not.
[205:06.05]It's been like three and a half hours.
[205:08.09]We need to do that.
[205:08.63]Ready?
[205:08.83]Are we good?
[205:12.77]Alright, good.
[205:35.83]Bosh up.
[205:36.99]Bosh up.
[205:39.05]Crazy into, crazy into you.
[205:41.27]Now you guys are making me do it.
[205:44.81]Chibi-Robo already one day shipped memory card?
[205:49.80]When I tell you I'm going to make something happen, I'm going to make it happen.
[205:54.54]Bob.
[205:55.90]Hey, hey, hey.
[205:57.40]Hey, Bob.
[205:59.12]Say, Chibo, you saw Jenny, right?
[206:01.46]Yes, I did.
[206:03.88]Don't you think she looks weird?
[206:05.14]I mean, she thinks she's a frog.
[206:08.84]Uh... She's just a kid having fun.
[206:20.18]No.
[206:20.72]You just have to have done frogs as a kid.
[206:22.84]There's like two.
[206:24.04]One day she just started saying ribbit and nothing else.
[206:26.72]I don't know what happened.
[206:28.84]I know, I live with freaks.
[206:30.22]Holy shit, mom.
[206:31.32]Would you like to chat with me for a bit?
[206:34.10]Yeah, sure.
[206:36.88]Oh, you're well made.
[206:37.66]Now that the water is boiling, let's have tea.
[206:45.12]Since you're so small, you can sit over here.
[207:01.28]Bee movie?
[207:02.20]That's what I was thinking too.
[207:09.36]Oh, do you see my husband sleeping on the sofa?
[207:12.58]Lazy, no good, so-and-so.
[207:19.97]That's right.
[207:20.81]Sure.
[207:22.97]But you think I'm too harsh?
[207:24.39]It was his fault.
[207:27.19]He bought you without even asking me.
[207:30.13]He's between jobs right now, and yet he spends moolah like crazy.
[207:33.01]He's a slacker and a bum.
[207:35.79]Uh... I mean, we're having tea.
[207:41.81]We're like... You're venting.
[207:43.76]Should I... Is this like a... No, yeah, yeah.
[207:50.50]Or is this like a no, no, I...
[207:54.17]No, he's just between you.
[207:56.63]Oh, I'm sorry.
[207:57.23]It's not fair for me to go off on you like that.
[208:04.53]You know, tea always tastes better when you have someone to talk to.
[208:08.47]Thank you, Chibo.
[208:11.84]Thirteen happy points.
[208:13.64]That's it?
[208:14.80]Okay.
[208:22.17]I mean, someone who says something other than ribbit.
[208:28.14]Maybe I made it a little too strong.
[208:31.00]I think this tea is too bitter.
[208:33.34]Oh, very nice.
[208:33.98]You've been cleaning up the house.
[208:36.52]Thank you, Chibo.
[208:39.28]I think Mom needs to go on vacation.
[208:43.68]Ooh, my little teacup!
[208:49.49]Can I drink it?
[208:53.69]Sugar?
[208:56.82]Oh, you want sugar?
[208:57.90]You'll stuff anything in your head, won't you?
[209:00.34]You want some sugar?
[209:01.56]Sugar cube.
[209:02.74]Oh, you want some?
[209:07.60]Uh, I'll get that.
[209:08.46]Let me get that for you.
[209:12.08]Oh, cookies!
[209:14.54]Guess those are delicious, but they'll make you fat if you eat too many.
[209:18.25]Bomb!
[209:21.64]Can you stop being the ultimate buzzkill?
[209:26.81]Oh that yes, those are all bills My husband is constantly blowing all our moolah on his stupid toys People are supposed to grow out of toys sooner or later at least normal people are If you put that in the garbage can it would be a big help
[209:50.26]I bet Jenny would really like that.
[209:54.31]I know she would.
[209:55.15]Because I actually talk to your daughter.
[209:57.01]One of these days I'm going to sell all his toys at a garage sale or just throw them out. ...
[210:20.55]Can I do anything else?
[210:25.93]No?
[210:26.27]Okay, I got everything on the table.
[210:28.37]You gotta clean up your cookie crumbs, though.
[210:30.11]I get this.
[210:30.57]Don't worry, Mrs. Sanderson.
[210:33.37]I bet the goldfish will eat it.
[210:34.35]Yep.
[210:37.57]Make her tea sweet.
[210:42.49]Hey, Chibu, did you bring me a sugar cube?
[210:44.79]Yes, I did.
[210:45.29]I'm here to serve.
[210:57.69]Gunpowder.
[211:01.33]No, I'm not gonna poison her.
[211:02.60]I want the happy points.
[211:05.62]I'm trying to save money to bring back GigaChad, or whatever his name is.
[211:09.40]How thoughtful of you.
[211:20.19]You got $36.
[211:21.41]Spread the happiness.
[211:23.47]And his dad still watches Space Hunter Drake Redcrest.
[211:25.87]It's like living with an infant.
[211:28.51]I mean, he's an adult.
[211:29.49]Don't you think there's something wrong with him?
[211:31.01]I'm not a marriage counselor!
[211:38.55]Okay.
[211:41.57]Let me answer this truthfully.
[211:44.46]On one hand...
[211:46.77]He's spending all their money on toys.
[211:49.81]They got bills to pay.
[211:50.67]It's pretty irresponsible.
[211:53.44]I mean, that's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[211:56.20]On the other hand, probably six months ago, I watched the entire first season of SpongeBob.
[212:03.78]Just in bed.
[212:05.97]So, this is a tough one for me.
[212:21.69]No, he's projecting.
[212:24.15]Let her vent.
[212:24.87]Alright, vent.
[212:26.07]Yes, yes, come on.
[212:27.17]What's he doing?
[212:27.85]He buys all these... You're very understanding.
[212:31.61]Our upstairs bedroom is crammed full of that pathetic Drake Redcrest junk.
[212:36.37]Say, how do you reach high places when you're such a little guy?
[212:38.85]I bet that Chibi-Robo manual that Jenny's dad got would say something about that.
[212:46.06]Too sweet?
[212:47.46]Oh no, it's bitter, I forgot to Ster it.
[212:50.68]Let's see, something to Ster with, something to Ster with.
[212:59.75]Hey wow, that's a kid's spoon, isn't it?
[213:03.27]I bet you could use that as a shovel.
[213:06.95]Isn't there a spoon around here somewhere?
[213:08.33]I got it.

[217:57.37]How do I get up there?
[217:58.11]See what I'm saying?
[217:59.75]Like, there's no reliable way.
[218:01.15]Maybe if I... Can I get on the fish tank and climb up on that thing?
[218:09.10]I can't climb this.
[218:10.04]This would be the way that I would say you would do it.

[248:24.92]Why is there oil in here?
[248:27.40]Investigate.
[248:27.80]Oh.
[248:40.54]Yep, that's oil alright.
[248:41.49]I wonder where it came from, huh?
[248:47.17]From above.
[248:48.47]It's dripping from... Oh, it's just dripping from Dad's fingers.
[248:56.22]Uh-oh, it's Spider-Bot!
[249:07.69]Those are the things from the news.
[249:08.97]The spiders are here.
[249:10.61]Uh-oh.
[249:13.81]I know this move.
[249:14.79]It's... It's... The enemy spider circle.
[249:22.59]Spider roulette.
[249:25.97]This is going to be bad.
[249:26.97]Really bad.
[249:27.43]Quick.
[249:27.72]Get the chibi blaster.
[249:30.28]Did I leave the oven on?
[249:42.98]Ooh, scrap!
[249:45.38]That's what I think it is.
[249:46.12]It's scrap.
[249:46.62]Yes!
[249:48.94]Collect enough of that and you can build a utility bot with the Recycletron.
[249:54.14]Spiders are good for something after all.
[249:55.48]They're good for recycling.
[249:56.50]Tee hee hee.
[250:01.44]I have enough to build a ladder.
[250:09.40]I'm gonna clean up their fucking mess.
[250:23.63]That was brutal.
[250:24.61]Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[250:25.93]Alright, uh, here we go.
[250:27.69]Let's make the ladder.
[250:31.28]I have 300.
[250:32.60]I missed a spot?
[250:38.63]What kind of cleaning robot am I?
[250:54.68]Let's do it.
[250:57.74]Okay.
[250:59.40]Chibi manual has something to say about Utilibots.
[251:02.44]Yeah, I know.
[251:02.76]Welcome to the Chibi PC.
[251:08.32]Recycletron.
[251:08.98]Alright.
[251:09.94]Living room ladder.
[251:10.76]A ladder that reaches high places placed near the Chibi-Robo house.
[251:14.28]Build it.
[251:14.64]Put your scrap into the Recycletron.
[251:26.89]Nice.
[251:32.29]And... What is it?
[251:34.37]Something came out.
[251:36.03]Set it out in the living room.
[251:41.84]I can finally reach high places.
[251:44.68]Very cool.
[251:46.14]Where'd it go?
[251:55.32]Oh, it's underneath that big present sheet.
[251:59.34]Congratulations on building the utility bot.
[252:02.78]Hee hee.
[252:04.14]I feel like we got a new partner.
[252:05.32]I'm so happy.
[252:08.31]Abnormal activity detected while on patrol.
[252:10.25]Uh-oh.
[252:15.49]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest.
[252:18.55]Alert.
[252:19.29]Alert.
[252:20.19]Al... Huh?
[252:22.95]What have we here?
[252:26.33]Now, Chibi-Robo, are you ready?
[252:28.21]Yes.
[252:30.89]Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to the newest member of the family, Ladder Guy.
[252:37.78]Hey, it's me, Ladder Guy.
[252:51.76]How are you?
[252:52.62]I'm so happy to be part of your family.
[252:57.57]Right?
[252:57.77]Come on.
[253:00.39]This nifty ladder utility bot will let you do all sorts of things.
[253:04.67]You can push or pull it, in addition to raising it up and down.
[253:08.74]Isn't that something?
[253:11.74]It's Hawks, right?
[253:13.84]Greg Redcrest is confused and angry, but it does not appear to be evil.
[253:20.49]In addition to normal, the situation is peaceful.
[253:25.90]The patrol must continue.
[253:28.00]I'll keep up the good work.
[253:29.42]Thank you.
[253:33.57]You can reach the high parts of the house, Chibi-Robo.
[253:38.69]I have no mouth and must scream.
[253:40.59]I cannot scream.
[253:41.51]I present to you my new song.
[253:46.99]Are you ready to be amazed?
[253:49.49]Sure.
[253:51.87]I, Television, will now enthrall you with the gift of song.
[253:54.33]This one is called...
[253:56.96]Teriyaki Blues!
[254:10.95]I see somebody spent 20 minutes in GarageBand as well.
[254:19.00]Yep!
[254:19.86]What?
[254:27.98]Gya!
[254:29.14]Gya!
[254:29.94]Haha!
[254:32.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[254:38.93]Don't cry on the new equipment.
[254:43.45]I'm afraid I've been interrupted by a malfunction of some kind.
[254:46.27]I'm sorry you couldn't hear the whole song.
[254:56.11]Thanks.
[254:56.93]Anyway, you were a great audience.
[255:07.14]Okay, what do you got to say?
[255:09.22]Well, now that that's out of the way, press A next to me and I'll lift A up.
[255:13.24]Press left and right and I'll move left and right.
[255:15.02]Right?
[255:15.22]Come on.
[255:17.28]We need it.
[255:18.52]Let's hear it.
[255:18.98]I don't...
[255:28.07]Insert your plug to raise the ladder.
[255:29.31]If you want to lower it, tilt down.
[255:30.79]Oh.
[255:32.19]Change the ladder's direction.
[255:33.11]Plug yourself into a different side.
[255:36.85]You can push or pull freely to drive moving.
[255:38.51]Yeah, okay, okay.
[255:39.25]I get you.
[255:43.07]How far does this go?
[255:48.34]Holy shit.
[255:49.08]This takes a lot of power.
[255:50.04]Uh, we're just gonna... Just let it go the whole thing.
[256:00.91]I'll be back.
[256:08.62]You're gonna die.
[256:11.46]Yeah, that was close.
[256:12.40]Your energy is full.
[256:13.34]Would you like to save?
[256:14.36]No.
[256:19.36]You're making them bankrupt.
[256:23.68]Blame dad.
[256:25.48]I'm doing my best.
[256:26.30]I'm just gonna climb it.
[256:37.88]Still no memory card?
[256:39.22]No, it's okay, though.
[256:41.08]Doesn't mean that we've been on, what, four and a half hours or so?
[256:43.74]It'll be fine.
[256:44.18]Alright, we're going from here to there.
[256:52.04]Oh, look at that.
[256:52.54]That's so sad.
[256:58.06]Alright, let's do it.
[257:08.50]I'll go this way, that way.
[257:16.26]Only one coin in here?
[257:21.34]Where do I want to take this from now?
[257:22.48]Alright, we can go up there.
[257:24.30]We're going up here.
[257:25.76]We're getting that frog ring.
[257:27.12]I love this game.
[257:28.44]This is a fun game.
[257:32.26]Oh shit, I can... Oh!
[257:44.32]It's very cozy.
[257:45.02]Yeah, it's just... It's very nice.
[257:48.91]It's very nice.
[257:50.47]It's not a whole lot of, like, stress or anything.
[257:53.19]It's just fun.
[257:55.23]Who doesn't love Chibi Robot?
[257:56.81]I don't know.
[257:57.23]I don't know who wouldn't.
[257:59.71]It seems hard to not like it.
[258:00.79]Alright, let's move this this way.
[258:06.84]No, no, wait.
[258:07.46]I'm assuming it has to be on the right.
[258:09.08]The plug has to be on the side that you want it to move?
[258:16.23]Wait, am I in the way?
[258:24.60]How do I move it, though?
[258:25.46]Can I wait?
[258:26.00]Can I just push it?
[258:28.22]You just push it.
[258:30.45]You do?
[258:30.81]No, you... Oh, you do?
[258:38.05]Okay, I was figuring...
[258:41.00]That's how you tilt it.
[258:43.68]He's like, it hurts.
[258:44.56]Alright, we're going up.
[258:48.05]Nintendo hates it, apparently.
[258:54.79]Yeah, Nintendo did this thing where they really, really, really, for some reason, want you to really like Toad.
[258:59.80]Because they have all these cool characters and all these interesting franchises, but, like, please like Toad.
[259:11.82]What's wrong with Toad?
[259:14.42]You want me to go over the things that are wrong with Toad?
[259:16.04]No, I don't know if I want to do this.
[259:32.71]No, not in the same stream.
[259:33.95]You've got to spread this out.
[259:35.31]You've got to spread these out.
[259:38.52]I can't tell you that I don't like Zelda and that Toad is dumb in the same stream.
[259:42.50]If I do that, I'm gonna lose like 50,000 subs.
[259:43.92]I'm sorry, we have to spread this out over the course of like 10 months.
[260:03.83]One controversy per year, Jeremy.
[260:06.35]One controversy a year.
[260:09.07]There's a plug up here.
[260:11.33]Oh, dude, uh, 10 community subs from DeSoyd Kachaptha.
[260:16.92]The reverse happened.
[260:18.90]Aiding Toad is not controversial.
[260:24.08]I don't hate Toad.
[260:25.10]I just, I mean, there's other, there's other games they could make besides Toad's, like, treasure tracker.
[260:32.93]There's like three of them.
[260:34.65]How many Toad treasure tracker games are there?
[260:41.67]That game's great.
[260:42.39]Now imagine... No, hold on.
[260:44.44]That game's good, right?
[260:45.66]That game's a good game?
[260:46.92]Wait.
[260:47.64]What if Toad Treasure Tracker was Chibi-Robo 2?
[260:50.10]Think about that.
[260:51.48]Chibi-Robo isn't by Nintendo.
[261:00.30]Chibi-Robo 2 exists.
[261:04.05]Oh.
[261:04.73]Yeah, but it's on the DS, right?
[261:05.85]It's not... They...
[261:12.26]Oh, fuck.
[261:12.60]I'm on battery.
[261:13.95]We're almost at a battery here.
[261:16.03]We are dangerously low on battery.
[261:19.17]Oh, shit.
[261:19.67]Oh, shit.
[261:20.25]Oh, my God.
[261:22.19]I think I'm gonna die.
[261:23.11]Uh, there's a bug right here, right?
[261:43.71]There's a Japanese-only DS sequel that plays like the original and is a direct story continuation.
[261:49.65]Why... Okay, what is with... Why don't they think Western audiences like this?
[261:56.99]I don't get it.
[262:00.02]This is... Why wouldn't they... Why would it not come out in America and Europe and stuff?
[262:08.70]Because of translations.
[262:21.82]It's because they lose money on a translation?
[262:29.15]Um... Is this high enough?
[262:31.51]I think I have to go down.
[262:32.83]Can I go any higher?
[262:33.91]I don't think I can... No, I'm gonna have to go back down.
[262:43.30]Go down.
[262:47.34]It's also localization.
[262:53.65]American only.
[262:54.71]I want gun, burger, and car.
[262:56.49]What are you talking about?
[263:04.81]That's as high as it goes?
[263:06.84]Come on.
[263:07.38]Alright, let's move it down here.
[263:09.04]Because I want to get up to there.
[263:18.26]Up there.
[263:26.36]Alright.
[263:26.58]Can I, like, retract the club?
[263:28.98]The club.
[263:29.90]The plug.
[263:33.22]You guys understand how fucked up my brain is?
[263:35.42]I just said plug backwards, essentially.
[263:38.90]Gulp.
[263:50.77]The plug.
[264:01.90]Too high, too high, monkey ass, too high!
[264:04.16]I'm so fucked up, man.
[264:08.86]Relax.
[264:09.16]Drink some water.
[264:30.95]Oh man, I'm so fucked up.
[264:32.03]I don't even know, man.
[264:38.28]What was the point of coming up here this high?
[264:39.68]Hmm.
[264:42.12]Demon door right there.
[264:43.00]Ooh, demon door.
[264:44.78]And another way to go.
[264:45.74]Ooh, can I climb up this?
[264:51.74]No.
[264:55.02]Shit, alright.
[264:56.34]There's nothing up here.
[264:57.38]Just a plug.
[264:58.80]Wait.
[265:02.89]Weed, dude, weed, weed, weed, weed, pog, weed, dude, weed, pog.
[265:09.75]Can I open this?
[265:13.19]Ooh.
[265:14.83]Hold on.
[265:20.64]Okay.
[265:31.91]Ten happy points.
[265:34.79]Okay, so from here, can I do anything else?
[265:37.51]I guess I can go down a little.
[265:41.77]Dude, epicness.
[265:44.53]Epicness.
[265:52.54]Epicness.
[265:56.08]Demon door?
[265:56.92]Yeah, I've already gotten it.
[265:57.84]There's a demon door back here.
[265:58.80]I have to push this back.
[266:03.70]So much to explore.
[266:04.34]We're going up to the telephone.
[266:05.16]Shuri, you just won the internet.
[266:05.92]Whatever.
[266:47.21]oh can I use the phone?
[266:49.59]get up thank you for the gold
[267:00.28]You know, I didn't know what the hell that did or what it meant or what it was until seven or eight months ago.
[267:17.97]Telephone?
[267:22.04]Um...
[267:24.46]There's a ring up there.
[267:25.30]There's a plug up there, too.
[267:26.70]Alright, I'm going to move this back again.
[267:27.98]We're going to go here.
[267:28.78]Can I reach this?
[267:33.69]Nothing on this side of the phone.
[267:34.89]Can I climb?
[267:37.13]I can't climb that.
[267:38.13]What?
[267:39.01]I was going to say three.
[267:41.75]Three.
[267:42.07]Who cares?
[267:56.51]Why don't you stream on Reddit?
[267:58.11]This is rude.
[268:01.87]Reddit live.
[268:10.88]Holy crap.
[268:11.78]Two golds.
[268:12.38]This blew up.
[268:15.70]I still don't even get what it means.
[268:20.78]So, okay, I want to repeat this so I can make sure I get this right.
[268:26.15]Stop throwing shit at me.
[268:31.07]So, Reddit has a system where you upvote stuff.
[268:35.58]So, okay, let's say if somebody makes a comment, and that comment, a lot of people agree with it, and a hundred people press the button to go up, yeah, and that's one of the top kind of comments, top posts, right?
[268:46.79]So somebody can pay money to put a stamp on that post.
[268:52.15]Right?
[268:52.69]And that just... That's it.
[268:54.07]It's just somebody decided to be like, holy shit, I loved what you said so much that I paid 44 cents for it.
[269:01.14]Right?
[269:02.34]Or something like 20... A dollar or something, right?
[269:05.56]Is that what it means?
[269:09.66]And then they get some website perks.
[269:11.67]Okay.

[270:16.33]Can I put this up to press the button or something?
[270:18.83]Oh.
[270:22.07]Well, here we are.

[271:14.43]How do I get in the TV? ...
[271:26.09]Can I go under it?
[271:32.66]Remember, you're about to get 10 million views.
[271:34.68]Already got it.
[271:35.80]We already got it, like, a couple hours ago.
[271:37.54]It was crazy.
[271:39.34]I popped a bottle of champagne.
[271:40.60]It was nuts.
[271:49.50]I still need to get over here.
[271:50.46]Hold on.
[271:50.70]Turn this around.
[271:55.43]Can I make the platform just be here so I can... Alright, now bring it down.
[271:59.51]There's a hole in that wall over there.
[272:13.07]Whoa!
[272:17.73]Burn it up.
[272:18.17]I can probably blast that wall.
[272:26.20]Good.
[272:26.38]Let's get it closer.
[272:27.62]Alright, let's get it down here.
[272:29.90]Yeah, that's it.
[272:30.34]Let's go.
[272:31.68]No!
[272:32.54]I don't want to go to bed.
[272:33.78]I don't want to go to bed.
[272:43.77]I don't want to go to bed.
[272:44.59]I don't want to go to bed.
[273:01.07]So anyways, um, Reddit... They pay reddit gold to somebody and they get some perks for the website.
[273:08.37]And they know who, but they don't know who it was.
[273:11.05]So anyways, reddit.
[273:13.29]Rank 80.
[273:28.54]Get off Reddit and go to bed.
[273:31.22]That's why they say thanks for the gold, kind stranger.
[273:41.09]Let's see.
[273:56.71]Cool.
[273:57.71]Pretty cool.
[274:01.35]Thank you, kind sir.

[274:52.61]Yeah, whatever.
[274:53.55]Yeah, whatever.
[274:56.99]Alright, let's get on top of the chair.
[274:58.47]And then we're gonna go over there.
[275:10.70]There's a lot of places to go with this.
[275:19.43]Real wink?
[275:19.99]Let me check.
[275:20.45]Let me verify it.
[275:22.21]Okay, it was real.
[275:27.68]My eyes are so red.
[275:38.83]I don't know why.
[275:45.59]So I can climb this shit.
[275:47.21]Clean the trash up here.
[275:54.85]How come some people get full facecam winks and other people only get a tiny window of a wink?
[275:59.61]It's the same thing.
[276:00.15]See, it's the same thing.
[276:03.51]Don't worry.
[276:12.23]50 cents.
[276:17.49]Red silver versus red gold.
[276:20.67]You guys are fucking crazy.
[276:31.87]Alright, have I gotten everything in here?
[276:32.95]All the demon doors and everything?
[276:39.33]Couch behind Dad's head.
[276:42.11]Demon door up there.
[276:43.71]Next to the clock.
[276:45.34]We haven't gone over there yet.
[276:48.30]What about on the table?
[276:49.90]I haven't been on the table?
[276:51.44]How have I not been on the fucking table?
[276:55.78]That seems absurd, right?
[276:56.86]That's absurd.
[277:04.47]It's a full-screen wink for 150 million dollars.
[277:07.50]Alright, Dad.
[277:18.32]Oh, he's running out of power!
[277:31.37]Plug into Dad's head.
[277:34.31]Just... Just... Just... A week ago, you didn't even give me my wink.
[277:45.96]You turned the camera on and said, Did we get a wink?
[277:50.43]Nope.
[277:50.69]And then ended the stream.
[277:51.59]I was heartbroken and despondent.
[277:53.27]I won't be redeeming a wink again.
[278:00.49]I want to get the thing.
[278:10.19]I want to go on the table.
[278:12.53]Let's make it easy.
[278:20.91]Oh, Megalala, I'm sure Jerm is upset to hear that.
[278:23.29]Why?
[278:26.15]Why are you making me some kind of villain?
[278:28.45]Why am I a villain?
[278:29.33]Is this as high as this shit goes?
[278:36.55]Like, oh, I'm sure Jerm is soooo sad to hear that.
[278:43.23]Oh, I'm gonna turn the CD off.
[278:49.84]And then Dad's gonna freak out, right?
[278:58.58]Just barely.
[279:02.30]Candy bar wrappers.
[279:05.35]Cookie box.
[279:12.77]That's gonna freak out.
[279:16.29]Hey, turn that TV back on!
[279:20.47]Did he figure out how to pronounce refuse yet?
[279:28.42]That's what that word sounds like to me.
[279:48.87]This is way too high.
[279:50.09]Oh wait, he's on top of the TV.
[279:51.07]Should I talk to him first?
[279:53.77]Look up, you fool!
[280:09.49]I know, but I'm not tall enough to get over there.
[280:11.35]I know there's a frog going over there.
[280:12.55]Alright, I'm turning this TV off.
[280:25.28]Alright, Dad.
[280:25.78]You're gonna have to find something else to do.
[280:28.40]TV's going off.
[280:40.51]What the?
[280:43.23]Hey!
[280:43.81]Hold it, hold it.
[280:46.01]Whoa!
[280:49.09]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest is on!
[280:59.82]Dad just gave you 19 happy points.
[281:03.74]How can I get a 3-shirt?
[281:15.81]No, Ribbit!
[281:16.49]Chibi-ro-bit!
[281:20.36]That was close.
[281:21.38]Ribbit.
[281:23.40]Oh, do you want one of these?
[281:25.90]I have one.
[281:26.96]Look, Ribbit.
[281:28.52]Ribbit, maybe?
[281:31.81]Yes.
[281:35.25]Yay, a bit.
[281:36.11]13 happy points.
[281:38.47]Ribbit Gibby.
[281:39.01]Cookie Box.
[282:01.36]You're encouraging her too much.
[282:03.66]This isn't Monster Rancher.
[282:15.73]Six more.
[282:16.31]Ribbit.
[282:18.04]Alright, good.
[282:19.78]Hmm.
[282:22.70]Where else do I need here?
[282:25.32]Up there.
[282:26.94]Up there, up here.
[282:27.96]I don't think I can reach up there, though.
[282:31.43]It's a frog ring in there.
[282:32.51]I'm getting it.
[282:37.15]Can I get it?
[282:43.88]Just a wink?
[282:45.32]I just did it!
[282:45.74]Up there.
[282:55.68]Two winks?
[282:56.26]I got the one from before, too!
[283:07.39]The one from like 10 minutes ago.
[283:08.53]I got it.
[283:11.91]Now this one, on the other hand, I didn't get.
[283:24.39]Shit.
[283:25.35]It's just barely not tall enough.
[283:27.27]Come on.
[283:30.09]Wait.
[283:30.77]Alright.
[283:31.21]I have a plan.
[283:34.29]My plan is to...
[283:38.62]Push that onto here.
[283:40.54]No, that's not going to work.
[283:45.61]Does he not know it's on?
[283:47.57]Whatever.
[283:47.89]Do you think I care about the webcam being on?
[283:52.07]I'm a streamer.
[283:52.73]It should be on.
[283:57.23]He doesn't know.
[284:05.05]You guys shouldn't have said anything.
[284:06.35]You would have got me fucking putting my finger up my nose or, like, biting my lip and, like, eating boogers or something.
[284:11.18]You guys fucked that up.
[284:13.98]Big time.
[284:15.24]I really did not know it was still on, and you could have seen, like, a booger reading.
[284:19.97]Wow, you... One opportunity in, like, seven years.
[284:23.57]That was it, and you ruined it.
[284:27.53]You just missed a full booger being swallowed.
[284:30.39]I can't believe it.
[284:55.11]Oh, Chibi-Robo.
[284:57.28]I love it.
[284:59.02]Alright, can I bring this thing into other rooms?
[285:01.08]Someone redeemed a Jerm of booger.
[285:12.78]Dude, Pog's super frog voice.
[285:23.88]So, this can't go up any higher.
[285:25.26]For real.
[285:34.08]Alright, go up.
[285:36.94]No.
[285:37.96]Shit.
[285:41.08]Alright.
[285:41.68]I think I've done everything I can do with how tall this is.
[285:44.38]Maybe not.
[285:44.88]Wait, over there.
[285:48.26]Jeremy, you missed two boogers.
[285:50.55]If I had a booger-eating channel point redemption, I wouldn't be able to produce that many boogers.
[285:59.31]What are you talking about?
[286:00.13]I know there's dirt over here.
[286:21.02]Trying to get up there.
[286:22.54]Okay, out.
[286:31.23]Okay, alright.
[286:42.60]You guys are starting to disgust me.
[286:46.10]You're starting to disgust me.
[287:04.14]Nothing in here.
[287:04.88]I can... I'm just barely not going to be able to make this.
[287:12.97]Come on.
[287:17.43]Yes, I can.
[287:21.32]No!
[287:22.34]What?
[287:26.26]What?
[287:26.70]Are you kidding me?
[287:29.12]I can't make this.
[287:35.91]Really?
[287:36.81]That's so sad.
[287:45.79]I'm done.
[287:46.57]I'm done with this game.
[287:48.07]I'm done with this game.
[287:48.87]Wait, there's a book here.
[287:59.78]Hey, it's a photo album.
[288:01.68]Do you want to check it out?
[288:02.48]Yeah.
[288:03.92]I'm done with this game.
[288:07.58]They're having a barbecue.
[288:10.53]Sniff.
[288:11.33]I never get tired of looking at photos.
[288:15.01]Don't I have a photograph?
[288:16.85]They're having a barbecue.
[288:18.05]I have a picture.
[288:19.45]Can I put it in there?
[288:33.14]I guess I can't put it in.
[288:38.70]Alright, I think that's all I could do with that.
[288:45.54]There's not much else I can... I gotta do some cleaning.
[288:49.81]Anything else I can get with this ladder?
[288:53.69]Bad streamer.
[288:54.51]I think I got everything I can get.
[288:59.45]Maybe up this way?
[289:00.26]Have I done anything up there?
[289:01.44]Let's check.
[289:01.92]I need a power source.
[289:07.84]Wait, is the power source over here?
[289:09.00]Where's the plug?
[289:11.98]Over here.
[289:39.09]I'm not giving in.
[289:40.21]I'm not giving in to this shit.
[289:41.91]Alright, that's all I can do?
[290:09.94]I can't get up there.
[290:10.68]Not yet.
[290:14.73]Oh!
[290:16.39]Then we're going to do some cleaning.
[290:27.63]And I should have enough points to upgrade again, right?
[290:35.14]Is auto a...
[290:44.33]Otto's doing just fine he's over here having he's hanging out cleaning time like a good robo
[291:12.04]Wait, I can go upstairs!
[291:13.10]I have the ladder!
[291:14.20]No, I don't.
[291:16.00]I cleaned up a total of 135 stains.
[291:17.50]Heartbreak bleeding?
[291:18.46]Happy points!
[291:19.50]Oh, ssss!
[291:23.11]Happy points!
[291:24.63]Doing the super frog noise.
[291:42.87]Somebody was outside with their muddy shoes.
[291:46.21]Okay.
[291:53.71]Little bit more over here.
[292:01.67]I gotta be close.
[292:03.03]What about outside?
[292:11.90]I'm kinda stuck with what I should do next.
[292:16.80]Let me see what's available to buy.
[292:19.40]Missed a stain?
[292:25.46]I'll be fine.
[292:26.86]Upload those happy points.
[292:43.98]55!
[292:44.06]I'm almost in the top 50.
[292:45.05]How much do I have?
[292:52.87]Do I have enough for the car?
[292:55.35]Nice booger image.
[292:56.37]I saw it.
[293:18.31]How much is the car?
[293:19.19]Hot rod.
[293:25.50]2740.
[293:25.72]I'm almost there.
[293:30.76]I'm going outside.
[293:33.91]I feel like I haven't explored outside a whole lot.
[293:44.52]Outside is... Why did I say the booger thing?
[293:54.65]That's on me.
[293:55.61]That's a mistake.
[293:56.35]I have to remember.
[293:57.79]I have to remember that there's a bunch of people here that are going to say it and repeat it.
[294:04.03]And it's going to follow me around.
[294:09.48]Okay.
[294:11.42]We need something out here.
[294:19.70]Fighters!
[294:20.12]See you next time on Dragon Ball Z.
[294:49.95]It's find out next time.
[294:51.87]Fuck.
[294:54.09]No, now they're gonna know I've never seen one full episode of the show.
[294:58.03]And all they know, they're gonna know that the only thing I've ever done is I've, I've YouTubed, I've YouTubed random scenes from Dragon Ball Super for no reason.
[295:07.34]I've watched like a bunch of, I've watched a bunch of Beerus stuff for no reason.
[295:10.82]I have no intention to watch the show and I don't know why I did that.
[295:14.58]That's, they're gonna know this.
[295:23.43]Okay.
[295:24.10]Backyard.
[295:24.44]Did you watch JoJo, though?
[295:29.40]No.
[295:31.20]No.
[296:04.27]Still haven't given the frog any water.
[296:14.41]This is so sad.
[296:17.83]It's actually sad.
[296:18.87]Why hasn't somebody like picked up the frog?
[296:25.96]Where's the family?
[296:27.40]All dad does is watch cartoons all day.
[296:29.74]Oh, shit.
[296:40.63]Frog coin.
[296:47.57]Wait, this means shoot.
[296:48.41]This means shoot this.
[296:50.77]Shoot this.
[297:03.88]There's a dog bone over there.
[297:12.01]Donald Duck.
[297:22.68]Get this bone.
[297:25.88]Can I not pick this up?
[297:29.83]Wait, why can't I pick this up?
[297:32.35]It's stuck in the goddamn ground.
[297:34.07]I need to dig it up.
[297:39.21]Oh, Metroidvania.
[298:06.98]There's a demon door up here.
[298:07.84]There's a spider nest up here.
[298:12.80]Open the demon door.
[298:13.44]Remember, you're very likable and admirable.
[298:19.61]What's up?
[298:20.53]Thank you.
[298:23.73]What do we do with the spider's nest?
[298:30.54]Can I shoot it?
[298:40.73]Fuck out of here.
[298:44.17]Sing a letter.
[298:51.72]Sleeping baby birds!
[298:54.60]Hmm... Hello?
[299:03.66]He's in a deep sleep.
[299:05.96]If he doesn't move, we can't get to the other side.
[299:13.13]How do we wake up the bird?
[299:19.79]Okay.
[299:30.58]Recycle the bird.
[299:31.62]I don't think it works like that.
[299:34.44]Fuck, there's another demon door here.
[299:35.52]I gotta be careful, though.
[299:47.15]I can buy the car.
[299:50.63]Can I go anywhere else?
[299:56.84]I can go over there.
[300:00.86]What's that?
[300:14.67]Wait, wait, wait!
[300:47.35]Where's the plug?
[300:47.75]Where's the plug?
[300:50.00]Where's the outlet?
[300:51.46]Isn't it right here?
[300:52.32]Where is it?
[300:52.62]Isn't it right?
[300:52.98]I thought it was right here.
[300:53.54]There's a plug right here, isn't there?
[300:59.08]Where is it?
[300:59.42]There's no outlets outside.
[301:01.97]No!
[301:09.55]I have a battery, right?
[301:14.98]Okay, my battery.
[301:25.47]Oh, the battery is consumed.
[301:33.82]Oh, shit.
[301:37.46]Oh, my fucking god.
[301:38.80]I just lost like six hundred dollars.
[301:57.59]Hubris at the tree.
[302:08.00]I've only died twice in five hours, come on.
[302:10.44]You're making a fucking mess.
[302:17.26]Wait, how much?
[302:23.68]Or your ladder.
[302:25.24]Oh.
[302:25.70]I'm gonna, okay, it's daytime.
[302:26.78]We're gonna go kill some spiders and make a ladder of the court.
[302:33.02]Your chibi bank account is chibi low.
[302:35.92]Alright, I need to do... Fuck, I'm so mad.
[302:57.06]I have to go kill spiders.
[302:58.62]I'm just going to clean.
[302:59.62]I have to go up in the backyard during the day.
[303:02.66]It's okay, Jerma.
[303:04.52]Everything is going to heal.
[303:15.43]Time for some chibi tax evasion.
[303:24.33]Alright, any spiders in the foyer?
[303:32.86]I need scrap.
[303:33.50]Maybe you should crash the cheapy housing market.
[303:52.43]I can't even do anything in here.
[304:02.06]I need to get attacked by spiders, and we ran out of time last time.
[304:16.41]Can I go back to bed?
[304:19.73]Would I dress up as Chibi for a Halloween special?
[304:23.61]Talk to the eggs?
[304:24.75]Wait, didn't I already do that?
[304:30.14]How does one dress up as Chibi-Robo?
[304:36.18]Private Vegas reporting for duty!
[304:38.34]Uh-huh!
[304:40.59]You know that beautiful hunk of hot rod sitting up on the second floor?
[304:43.41]Yeah.
[304:47.27]You got a good eye on you, kid.
[304:48.85]Uh-huh.
[304:50.56]I've got a tricked out hot rod.
[304:52.77]When my tour with the Free Rangers ends, I'm gonna be a race car driver.
[304:56.45]Sounds pretty cool, Vegas.
[305:09.31]It's the broomer.
[305:29.95]Alright, I'm just going to waste time until tomorrow so I can attack by spiders outside.
[305:34.40]I think I'm done with the game.
[305:42.86]I'm done with this game.
[305:48.05]It's like alright.
[305:48.83]It's like fun, but I think I'm... Yeah, it's like alright.
[305:59.69]Are you gonna stream it again?
[306:00.79]Um, I don't know.
[306:01.91]Like, maybe.
[306:02.97]It's like, maybe.
[306:03.81]It's like, possible.
[306:06.13]It's not like a priority, but like, maybe.
[306:07.45]I don't know.
[306:08.16]I'm not like, you know what I mean?
[306:23.36]Pranked!
[306:24.04]Pranked!
[306:26.28]Alright, let's, uh, go back in here.
[306:39.98]Can I get to the spoon?
[306:41.12]I can't.
[306:41.86]Probably until I get the ladder in there.
[306:43.12]51.
[306:43.20]Alright, I need to go to bed.
[306:57.01]I don't want to save.
[306:58.53]Where's the sleep button?
[306:59.92]Can I just go to bed?
[307:02.82]How do I shut off?
[307:05.97]Alright, Chibi-Robo, smash your head against the wall as hard as you can.
[307:16.14]Oh, put the costume on?
[307:17.06]That's a costume you can get... Oh, you force the next day with a costume.
[307:27.25]Wait, can't I just do this?
[307:42.38]Just buy the shorter clock.
[307:50.34]Yeah, I could do that.
[307:55.63]This is probably something else I can do just to pass the time.
[307:58.51]Let me clean up some junk.
[308:00.59]Let me pick up some Cheetos on this guy's fucking couch.
[308:18.02]Oh, the dog's on here.
[308:18.78]Can we talk to the dog?
[308:30.65]I guess not.
[308:35.25]Talk to the eggs again?
[308:36.01]Alright, I'll get out there after I get these coins.
[308:43.33]Okay.
[308:48.12]Where do we get the boots?
[308:53.09]I kind of wonder what this face looks like.
[309:15.65]How about some trash?
[309:20.65]Put the camera on again?
[309:53.85]Pepe.
[309:54.13]Pepe laugh, he doesn't know.
[309:56.72]Pepe laugh.
[309:58.32]Pepe laugh.
[310:02.16]Pepe face, he doesn't know.
[310:04.96]Doesn't know.
[310:08.00]Medic, we've got a robo down!
[310:11.32]Wait a second, you're not hurt at all.

[322:17.62]Let's go over here.
[322:34.88]What is that, a stain?
[322:35.80]Not on my watch.
[322:39.99]Alright, let's juice it up.
[322:48.99]Awww.
[323:07.47]Can I get anything from there?
[323:17.95]Well, I can get the cookies.
[323:38.06]Move it back a bit?
[323:38.82]Was it hitting the thing?
[323:45.57]How's he stuck?
[323:50.25]He's stuck.
[323:53.90]I gotta put him down.
[323:54.76]Okay.
[324:07.99]Alright.
[324:09.39]Ah!
[324:10.29]Fuck.
[324:10.83]This game's noises are 10 out of 10.
[324:12.87]They are actually really good.
[324:14.07]They're very good.
[324:14.67]Good morning.
[324:32.58]Stop fucking doing that.
[324:33.20]Don't do that anymore.
[324:33.74]Look what you're doing.
[324:34.42]Still 43.
[324:34.58]Omega low.
[324:35.48]Yeah, whatever.
[324:35.84]No, I want to pick up the trash.
[325:01.09]I'm just leaving it
[325:20.96]Oh, people were saying that if I'm going to do GameCube, I should get Cubivore.
[325:24.12]Now, that's a very interesting thing to say.
[325:27.19]I looked up Cubivore.
[325:29.65]I was like, wow, that seems interesting.
[325:30.99]I think the game is $300.
[325:31.61]Is it worth $300?
[325:31.97]It's a $300 game.
[325:32.33]You could emulate it.
[325:51.12]Is this on Dolphin?
[325:51.82]No, this is on original hardware.
[325:54.86]But, alright, but if it's $300, that... I mean, these are gonna appreciate in value.
[326:00.60]If I hold, like, this is Chibi-Robo.
[326:03.18]This game's worth, like, $100.
[326:04.84]In 10 years, this game's gonna be worth, like, $500.
[326:06.46]These are assets.
[326:08.28]Alright, where's, um... I need to go to the foyer.
[326:18.82]Straight ahead.
[326:25.23]Like, is Cube of War going to be a thousand dollars in 2028?
[326:27.99]That's Beanie Baby logic.
[326:41.36]I'm not so sure about that.
[326:42.92]Because... People still want to play these old games on the original hardware and clothes.
[327:07.89]Only ones in mint condition will be worth it.
[327:10.33]Have you seen the condition of this disc?
[327:15.85]Would you be willing to take $1,000 from someone for this game?
[327:18.30]I'd be willing to look at who was giving me a telephone call.
[327:26.96]I don't know.
[327:29.14]Well, I don't know.
[327:30.02]If someone was going to pay me $1,000 for this game, would I do it?
[327:32.08]Yes, absolutely.
[327:34.38]Why wouldn't I?
[327:36.32]You mean like right now?
[327:37.04]Why wouldn't I do that?
[327:38.30]Alright, we're gonna go... Where do I want to take this ladder?
[327:44.88]Okay, go up on the sofa.
[327:48.24]Red block.
[327:51.78]My cube of war still has the $20 sticker on it.
[327:59.12]Wait, I can't go on the carpet.
[328:00.22]Uh-oh.
[328:11.73]I have to... Shit.
[328:19.76]Use it right here?
[328:20.50]Hold on, I gotta put it up.
[328:34.14]What if somebody gets the rights to this game and plans to make a million copies?
[328:45.93]This thing's going up way higher than it did before.
[328:48.11]Need an outlet now.
[328:53.85]So you're saying that somebody's gonna buy the rights to Chibi-Robo and then flood the market with Chibi-Robo discs?
[329:10.47]That's what happened with Nancy Drew.
[329:14.31]Wait, you know you can sell, yeah, okay.
[329:37.10]how much of the rights to Chibi-Robo oh shit I have to hold on fly fly fly look at the track god I'm so pissed off

[330:25.38]The person that owns it is here.
[330:26.92]That's so fucking sick, man.
[330:35.89]What was it like working on the game?
[330:51.32]Alright, now... What can I... I can't do anything with this.
[330:55.02]With the... Millennium Falcon thing.
[330:57.78]Can I fly over there?
[331:00.44]Let's get a good view.
[331:05.92]Go up there.
[331:06.52]I wonder if I can make it to the red block.

[346:21.99]There's a little bit of trash over here.
[346:49.93]No, no, no.
[346:50.37]I want the scrap.
[347:00.86]Good.
[347:06.63]I want that scrap.
[347:07.71]I thought an ad was playing.
[347:20.45]Alright, we're going to come back tomorrow, and we're going to go upstairs.
[347:25.38]Tomorrow is when we go upstairs.
[347:26.86]Let me see if I can get in this demon door before time runs out.
[347:34.93]How high is it?
[347:44.45]High enough?
[347:44.81]Let's hope so.
[347:49.89]Don't stop streaming yet.
[347:51.05]Oh, no, I'm talking about like tomorrow in the game.
[348:09.14]Another demon door up there too.
[348:31.27]29.
[348:31.33]Just don't die.
[348:32.21]Alright.
[348:35.31]I think I can get it.
[348:35.95]I just have to put it up a little higher.
[348:37.39]I'm going to run out of time, I think.
[349:03.26]Am I gonna say no?
[349:09.10]Better to be safe than dead.
[349:10.90]Yes, that's true.
[349:25.85]Can't go up any higher?
[349:29.15]Why not?
[349:30.43]It could go up so high!
[349:33.53]You saw how high we could just get this to go?
[349:55.00]Really?
[349:56.74]Doesn't know.
[349:57.38]What do I not know?
[350:08.45]Cam's on?
[350:09.11]Oh.
[350:12.55]I can't get the other one over here.
[350:14.41]Even if I push it down this way.
[350:15.67]This thing's not big enough.
[350:24.98]Can I get to anywhere else?
[350:26.32]Ooh, I can.
[350:27.26]Quick, get the snack!
[350:28.87]Get the cam!
[350:29.21]Cam!
[350:40.43]He is unaware of future events that may transpire, resulting in him having a negative experience that would be humorous to his viewing audience.
[350:46.87]Pepe laugh.
[350:51.26]I gotta be pretty high. 26.
[351:11.52]I would love to save, but I would also love to see if I can buy anything.
[351:13.54]What else you got in here?
[351:28.03]Kitchen ladder.
[351:29.43]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[351:30.75]Buy it.
[351:33.23]We can finally get the spoon.
[351:36.75]We can get the spoon to Ster mom's drink.
[351:51.02]It's a utility bot.
[351:54.66]Alright, should I buy the car?
[352:01.28]We're looking for advice.
[352:02.91]Is morality objective or subjective?
[352:04.93]Thanks.
[352:06.57]Um... I don't even know what that means.
[352:12.37]That's too much for right now.
[352:15.31]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[352:17.77]Um, okay.

[371:52.06]Time's running out.
[371:52.70]That doesn't matter.
[371:55.34]I can come back tomorrow.
[372:01.48]By the way, everybody has one of these under their bed.
[372:04.84]Especially where your head is.
[372:07.21]Where your headboard is.
[372:07.89]It's so hard to get under here.
[372:21.37]Um... Jenny?
[372:24.14]What are you keeping under here?
[372:29.01]Jenny, uh... Thank God there was an alien in his chest that killed him.
[372:46.80]Didn't I scare you?
[372:47.72]Yeah, you did actually.
[372:49.86]I thought we were going to be in trouble.
[372:53.50]Oh, you're being nice.
[372:54.54]Everybody's got one of these under their bed.
[373:08.75]Are there any random wrappers?
[373:11.61]Broth lozenges that you just find under here.
[373:14.01]Which, by the way, those are still good.
[373:15.21]Do you know how many times I've found vitamin C drops under here?
[373:22.42]They're probably three years old.
[373:24.20]They're going to be fine.
[373:25.56]They have like a 30-year expiration date.
[373:30.82]And they're in a wrapper.
[373:41.88]That feels so good.
[373:42.76]Alright, more trash.
[373:49.87]True story.
[373:51.27]Uh, this is a real story.
[373:54.71]So, Kim and I, uh, we did some cleaning.
[373:59.35]And we found, uh, we found a container under the bed of Ferrero Chase.
[374:08.72]It was a sealed container.
[374:12.00]It was covered in, like, dirt and dog hair and shit.
[374:18.20]But it was sealed in the box.
[374:22.02]And we knew they were probably, like, at least three to four months old.
[374:25.76]But they were still alright.
[374:26.88]They were still within expiration.
[374:29.76]So we were going back and forth about, like, is this shit... We can eat these, right?
[374:34.10]I mean, they were under the bed and covered in dog hair, but they were sealed in a container.
[374:38.20]That's okay.
[374:39.74]That's a great find.
[374:45.03]Now don't turn me off.
[374:46.35]That's not that gross.
[374:47.25]That's not that gross.
[374:49.17]No, I don't... I don't want to turn the stream off.
[374:51.33]Alright.
[374:51.63]Okay, alright.
[374:52.21]We'll see you tomorrow.
[374:52.91]As long as it was sealed.
[374:53.87]It was a sealed box, yeah.
[374:56.28]But it was fine.
[375:18.49]I'm number 14 in the world!
[375:19.93]What do you think?
[375:22.95]Is that a good place to stop for today?
[375:23.97]I'm being realistic.
[375:24.71]What, like six and a half hours?
[375:37.90]Do the rest tomorrow?
[375:38.52]I think that's a good place.
[375:41.96]We got another probably six, seven hours.
[375:43.56]I want to do this over two streams.
[375:45.70]This is like a 14 to 15 hour game, right?
[375:47.98]Like 12 to 14 hours?
[375:53.78]Is it another like full probably six, seven hours of this game?
[376:02.43]Roughly?
[376:02.91]Roughly?
[376:03.25]Okay.
[376:03.97]Is this...
[376:07.52]It's two hours max.
[376:08.76]No, it's not.
[376:17.97]12 to 14 at the rate... Yeah, that's... Yeah, whatever.
[376:20.03]That's another, like, seven hour stream tomorrow.
[376:21.87]Six to eight hour stream tomorrow.
[376:23.39]Yeah.
[376:25.12]Yeah, that... And we're just getting upstairs.
[376:27.18]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[376:28.50]I think this is a good place to stop.
[376:35.78]Play a little bit more.
[376:40.99]No, no, no.
[376:41.75]We'll stop.
[376:42.27]We'll stop.
[376:42.65]We'll stop.
[376:44.65]We'll stop right now.
[376:47.37]Plus, this is a good time that people, uh... You know, I started a little early.
[376:50.83]No, I didn't.
[376:51.89]I started... Wait.
[376:52.53]Let me... Let me correct this.
[376:54.56]Boy, your warp.
[376:56.92]What does that do?
[376:57.54]Okay, let's do it.
[377:03.70]You're not halfway through the game?
[377:04.82]That's what I'm saying.
[377:08.62]Okay.
[377:19.39]The game's addictive?
[377:20.15]Yeah, it is.
[377:21.19]I just want to leave enough time for there to be a full stream for this tomorrow.
[377:27.34]And then after this... That's a really good question, what we're going to do after this.
[377:36.83]Hmm.
[377:40.71]There's a lot of stuff that I have back here.
[377:42.77]But...
[377:44.70]Yeah, I'm gonna... We'll plug in, we'll save.
[377:47.52]And we'll pick it up after this tomorrow.
[377:49.44]We're still gonna hang out for like 20-30 minutes and do the bits.
[377:52.56]This is a good place to stop, I think.
[377:53.58]So we'll see you tomorrow.
[377:54.56]Around 2pm Pacific.
[377:55.12]See you then.
[377:55.46]For Chibi-Robo Part 2.
[378:19.07]I am actually going to do something... I'm kind of freaking out about the memory card scenario, because, I mean, this game's already saved and good.
[378:28.49]Before I go to bed, I'm going to turn this on.
[378:31.23]I'm going to turn the Wii off and turn it back on, and hope that the thing's not corrupted.
[378:38.02]You know what I mean?
[378:38.80]That's kind of... That's scaring me.
[378:39.96]I don't know why it is.
[378:41.20]It shouldn't happen, though.
[378:42.94]But, uh, we'll end it here.
[378:45.55]Probably see you guys maybe tomorrow.
[378:47.27]Starting around that like 1.30 to 2-ish p.m.
[378:49.95]Pacific.
[378:50.37]I just said that, but I'm repeating myself.
[378:52.05]It's okay.
[378:52.40]See you tomorrow.
[378:57.42]Thanks for watching.
[378:59.06]Part 2 tomorrow.
[379:05.37]It's corrupted.
[379:06.11]Oh, God.
[379:07.95]Leave the Wii on.
[379:08.79]No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
[379:09.63]Yeah, if it's been working this much, it'll be fine.
[379:16.68]Let's go back to earlier today.
[379:20.26]Take care, everybody.
[379:20.92]You're leaving.
[379:24.27]We had 250 from Gnarly.
[379:27.81]Earlier.
[379:30.18]And they say, do you really think you can climb the league ladder playing troll shit like Twisted Fae jungle?
[379:34.50]Oh my god, Jerma, you have to duo with me.
[379:36.71]I play top.
[379:38.13]My Sion is clean as fuck.
[379:41.27]But I also play Jax and Gnar.
[379:44.21]If you want to jungle play around top with someone like Zac.
[379:47.65]Are these even real league?
[379:49.37]Are these league champions?
[379:52.19]I'll carry you to gold.
[379:53.11]I feel like you're just making up names.
[380:00.66]I don't play League.
[380:01.84]Don't listen to any person that tells you I play League.
[380:05.34]Grandpa played League once.
[380:07.43]And it's one of the worst videos I've ever made.
[380:09.43]It's still up and it's still there.
[380:10.87]You can watch it if you want right now.
[380:13.61]Uh, ANC, thanks for the 500 bits.
[380:16.51]Is this the first Strand-type game?
[380:19.91]Maybe.
[380:22.75]I'm not gonna watch it on stream.
[380:26.95]Delete it on stream.
[380:28.05]No.
[380:29.65]fel6 thanks for the 500 bits fel6 I came home from college this weekend to visit family and introduced my sister to your streams my parents saw and they told me there is something wrong with you guys tell them just you gotta say you gotta introduce me as like a comedian you know what I mean like oh there's this comedian he has this show
[380:52.55]And then they'll be like, oh, okay, I get it.
[380:54.77]I get it.
[380:55.41]I see.
[380:55.79]It's just a show.
[380:56.69]He's a comedian.
[380:58.21]And then that's... Everything's fine.
[381:00.87]I hope you're not introducing me as a doctor or something.
[381:05.45]Hey, I watched this doctor on stream.
[381:07.31]Oh, he's a doctor?
[381:07.93]Oh, he sounds like a fucking idiot to me.
[381:12.15]Always introduce me as an e-clown or as a comedian.
[381:14.25]Come on.
[381:18.70]Fire25Shadow, thanks for the 500 bits.
[381:22.36]Five dollars.
[381:23.97]Jeremy, thanks for the fantastic streams.
[381:25.25]You brighten up my day.
[381:26.53]Looking forward to the rest of the year for more hilarious content.
[381:30.83]See?
[381:31.23]I'm not a doctor.
[381:33.31]Also, you missed my wink when Drake Redkiss first appeared.
[381:37.77]Missing fucking winks.
[381:51.46]I think that was a lie, but whatever.
[381:59.15]Anyways, thank you for the 500 bits.
[382:00.29]Why can you even have a name that long?
[382:04.05]Why is your name not like... Striker 2 or something?
[382:05.77]I don't know, why is it Jerma lied about the frog coin?
[382:21.15]Why is your name not something just like... Go get him.
[382:26.39]Six... Seven, eight.
[382:33.97]Thanks, though, for the five community subs.
[382:35.62]No.
[382:35.74]Yes, I am.
[382:36.14]Yes, I am.
[382:36.32]I mean, yes.
[382:50.46]Get out of here.
[382:51.38]Thanks for the $5.
[382:51.82]Hey, Wingman, thanks for the 500.
[382:53.78]Five community subs.
[382:58.02]Thank you, Wingman.
[383:02.39]God damn it.
[383:05.85]Gen Pendulum, thanks for the 300 bits, is another bit dream.
[383:09.92]I once dreamed that you were streaming puppeteering with a Yoda puppet, and at one point you forgot his name.
[383:23.44]It's pretty funny.
[383:25.81]Alright.
[383:26.17]Can you wish Marty a happy birthday for me?
[383:27.29]It'll make their night.
[383:27.91]Happy birthday, Marty.
[383:28.61]Happy birthday, Marty.
[383:29.25]Hope you have a good one.
[383:49.30]Take care.
[383:50.90]Thanks a lot, guys.
[383:51.80]Hope you enjoy it.
[383:52.36]It feels birthday, man, yeah?
[384:00.45]We also had 500 bits, $5 from Yukitare.
[384:06.83]They say, thanks for doing my silly request yesterday.
[384:08.73]Congratulations on 10 million views.
[384:11.45]An amazing amount for an amazing streamer and content creator.
[384:14.41]Look at me.
[384:14.81]Thank you.
[384:16.16]P.S.
[384:16.64]Item filter as in something that makes a custom sound when an item drops in game.
[384:20.47]Oh, okay.
[384:22.89]I get it.
[384:23.35]That makes sense.
[384:24.37]It'd be a thing.
[384:29.61]Jerma's average dong gave 30 community subs over the course of the night.
[384:33.20]So thanks for the 30 subs, dong.
[384:40.90]That's a username that you have spent money on.
[384:43.30]A lot of money.
[384:47.95]With average misspelled.
[384:50.65]He's wonderful.
[384:51.70]Wonderful.
[384:52.20]Where the fuck is Striker 2?
[384:53.84]Uh, Stripes Beast, thanks for the 500 bits.
[385:02.96]Thank you again for playing this game.
[385:04.18]After watching you cut, burn, and crush an Asian mother's hand yesterday, I'm relieved that you are playing a game about family strife.
[385:13.61]I'm doing a big road trip soon and I'm heading through Vegas.
[385:16.19]Any spots a poor man would like?
[385:18.89]Love you in the community.
[385:19.81]Decode the message.
[385:22.43]Do it one more time.
[385:23.93]The message needed to code.
[385:45.87]That's where I think you should go.
[385:51.51]Best restaurant in Vegas.
[385:55.54]You're a peanuts adult.
[386:04.02]Red Rock is a bit outside town and it's amazing hiking, walking.
[386:07.20]That's also true.
[386:09.13]Red Rock Canyon is beautiful.
[386:13.63]Highly recommend.
[386:14.27]I have seen it.
[386:17.56]Those are Mount Charleston.
[386:21.74]They have lodges up there.
[386:23.00]But that's not really going through Vegas, right?
[386:29.26]Mount Charleston's like a ski resort.
[386:31.72]But it is really nice.
[386:32.52]Remember to say hi to my parents if you see them.
[386:37.29]They're going to Vegas on Sunday.
[386:38.99]I will.
[386:46.75]What are you doing?
[386:47.95]I don't watch the links anymore.
[386:50.59]Half the time it's a Rickroll.
[386:59.30]Hold on a second.
[387:05.62]Alright, what do you got?
[387:11.55]What is this?
[387:11.87]Be careful what you wish for, Jerma.
[387:13.87]I'm curious what this is.
[387:14.91]I actually really want to know.
[387:17.75]Cut the music.
[387:18.21]Okay.
[387:28.36]What is it?
[387:34.46]Come on.
[387:37.31]Come on.
[387:37.75]I just want to be like Stuart Little for once.
[387:40.73]Please.
[387:41.21]Please.
[387:41.75]Please.
[387:47.54]I don't- I don't- Actual size.
[388:03.91]Oh, okay.
[388:13.47]How the fuck do you make this shit so-
[388:16.01]Alright, let's go.
[388:21.05]Heyyyy Cue the music.
[388:30.17]There it is.
[388:34.61]That person said they're partner modding, not their parent.
[388:37.43]What?
[388:48.05]Today is my parents' birthday.
[388:50.37]Let's go back and do that one again.
[388:57.06]That was swoosh, swoosh.
[388:59.08]Today is my partner's birthday.
[389:01.34]And we both love your stream.
[389:02.40]Can you give Marty a happy birthday?
[389:03.74]Happy birthday, Marty.
[389:05.32]Not somebody's parents.
[389:06.73]You're somebody's partner.
[389:07.89]I read it wrong.
[389:11.29]Thank you, Swoosh.
[389:11.99]Sorry about the mix-up.
[389:19.63]Yeah, I was right.
[389:22.39]My parents' birthday.
[389:23.81]We both love your stream.
[389:26.13]For a second, I'm like, wait, are you one of the parents?
[389:29.40]And I'm like, what the fuck am I talking about?
[389:30.76]Does that sound weird?
[389:32.04]Yeah, that was wrong.
[389:32.92]I'm an idiot.
[389:43.88]It's okay.
[389:45.08]Oh, I know.
[389:46.94]Alright, let's keep going.
[389:49.38]Uh, we had... I don't know.
[389:55.14]Where are we?
[389:56.12]Right here.
[389:59.62]Uh, we had J. Han.
[390:02.45]J. Han Izzle.
[390:03.97]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[390:07.49]Ten bucks.
[390:07.85]Hey, Jerma, today's my 20th birthday.
[390:09.39]Okay.
[390:11.90]Happy birthday.
[390:13.50]I'm glad this game was postponed today, and I'm sorry about the memory card.
[390:21.23]It's alright.
[390:23.29]I'm glad that I didn't try to continue to play yesterday.
[390:26.41]I'm glad we pivoted to Cooking Mama.
[390:27.93]That was also a very fun time for me, so we're good.
[390:31.47]Thanks for the laughs over the years, and I look forward to any big future projects you have planned.
[390:35.69]Also, please show feed on stream.
[390:37.35]Thank you.
[390:38.75]Uh, no.
[390:39.83]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[390:44.29]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[390:45.19]Appreciate it.
[390:48.23]Erotic Frankfort.
[390:49.53]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[390:50.43]Hello from Australia.
[390:51.35]Please say g'day, mate.
[390:53.59]G'day, mate.
[390:55.60]Hello from America.
[390:57.30]Specifically Las Vegas.
[391:02.20]He did the super frog voice.
[391:04.28]Now I'm going to be conscious of that.
[391:07.56]Potato Chief.
[391:09.11]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[391:10.37]Great impression of someone being attacked by bees.
[391:19.74]I want to see that clip.
[391:23.40]Somebody give me the clip of the Tasmanian Devil.
[391:26.46]I want to hear it.
[391:27.36]I want to see how close it was.
[391:29.50]Does anybody have it?
[391:32.22]Also, can't wait for you guys to, every time we get raided, to have a perfect clip of this.
[391:38.81]But anytime somebody raids us or a new community comes in to say hello, can't wait for this to be revealed.
[391:53.52]Actually, not that bad.
[392:03.01]Actually, it was a little too high, though.
[392:04.65]I think it was too high.
[392:09.13]No, I'm not trying again.
[392:19.65]No, I can't go all in right now.
[392:20.94]It'll be embarrassing.
[392:24.12]Hey, I've attacked my piece.
[392:30.32]Apple Shift, thanks for the $2.50.
[392:31.24]Yo, are you planning on doing any conventions this year?
[392:34.84]Not this year, no.
[392:38.03]Probably TwitchCon.
[392:40.33]I think I'm only going to TwitchCon.
[392:46.52]I have no plans on going to E3.
[392:48.02]I have no plans on going anywhere in the immediate future.
[392:50.88]Any packs?
[392:52.12]Which con's the next thing that's in the radar here?
[392:56.92]Dexcon delayed.
[392:58.24]Yeah, now it'll be embarrassing.
[393:09.18]We already talked about this.
[393:09.98]If you weren't here before...
[393:12.58]If you do a Tasmanian Devil impression, if you don't go fucking as hard as you possibly can, it's going to be embarrassing.
[393:22.15]It's zero and a hundred.
[393:23.13]If you don't go to a hundred, it's going to be like, whoa, that was horrible and embarrassing.
[393:28.41]I'm embarrassed for you.
[393:33.76]Trust me.
[393:34.60]I know.
[393:35.94]It was still embarrassing.
[393:37.14]Not for me.
[393:39.98]Hey, SirCanine, thanks for the 250.
[393:41.58]My face when Jeremy makes the short jokes himself by celebrating that he can reach high things when he gets a ladder.
[393:47.80]Feels bad, man.
[393:48.64]It's ChibiRobo.
[393:49.54]You're as big as eight thimbles stacked on top of each other.
[393:54.30]Of course I'm going to be making references about being smaller.
[393:59.81]SirCanine, thanks for the 250.
[394:01.13]Local Chibi streamer loses it over a Chibi children's game while drinking Chibi cola and giving out free Chibi winks.
[394:08.79]Thanks.
[394:12.27]Stix Renegade, thanks for the 250.
[394:13.37]Hey Jerm, I haven't cheered in a while.
[394:16.05]Trying to save cash for some incoming car troubles in a furry convention.
[394:19.79]Alright.
[394:20.67]Turns out the car trouble wasn't as bad, so I'm passing a few of my savings on to you.
[394:24.55]Also, three fucking years I've been subbed.
[394:26.61]It's a long ass time.
[394:29.67]What's that three year sub badge?
[394:31.40]Where's the three year sub badge?
[394:33.62]Yeah, I know.
[394:34.56]Also, Crash Team Racing, Nitro Fueled, and Burger King Xbox 360 games.
[394:39.02]When are you gonna play them?
[394:40.22]Also, Draw My Fursona.
[394:43.38]I'm busy.
[394:45.06]But... I'll probably get this Burger King games.
[394:50.82]I'll do them all in like 20 minutes or something.
[394:52.38]You could probably beat all those games in an hour, so... Yeah, I have 360.
[395:06.73]I got Xbox games, 360 games.
[395:09.29]They're all good, too.
[395:11.38]So here's what happened.
[395:12.98]So as you all know, we've done a lot of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, random Xbox games.
[395:17.94]We've played a lot of shitty, terrible, crap old games.
[395:23.63]And the only ones that are left are the good ones.
[395:26.91]So there are a bunch of games over here that are all the good ones that are just here.
[395:35.46]There's at least probably 20 games over here that are all worth playing completely all the way through.
[395:41.85]So, we got a long way.
[395:45.95]I bet I could find some more trash.
[395:47.45]Oh, don't worry.
[395:49.57]There's too much trash on these consoles that it would be impossible to not ever do that again.
[395:58.20]What are some of them?
[395:59.62]Well, I don't want to give away spoilers.
[396:03.17]Just speaking of GameCube, I mean, Mario Sunshine, Eternal Darkness, both beautiful Joes.
[396:14.04]I don't even want to go further than that.
[396:15.42]I don't want to go, Gacha Force, which is one of the best GameCube games ever.
[396:22.56]They're so good.
[396:24.70]They're going to be all done to their completion.
[396:37.30]Kirby's Air Ride.
[396:38.20]I don't have it.
[396:40.00]Maybe I'll get it.
[396:42.10]Anyways, we're almost done with the bits here.
[396:44.14]We have about five or six more to do.
[396:47.96]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the $2.50.
[396:49.40]Jeremiah, I want to thank you for being so accommodating to those with busy schedules who can't catch the whole stream.
[396:55.06]If you didn't reuse the same joke three times, we might miss some content.
[396:58.73]Hearts.
[396:59.83]I'm looking out for you.
[397:01.63]I'm looking out for you.
[397:04.59]Don't you guys ever watch the news?
[397:07.97]If you ever watch the news, the news is on, like, for instance, some networks that are 24-hour news networks, and it's the same two-hour broadcast for 24 hours.
[397:18.75]You know, I've got to cycle in the new people that are coming in.
[397:20.86]They've got to know what's going on today.
[397:29.30]And it's all fake.
[397:34.51]Play Illbleed.
[397:35.96]I actually tried to track a copy of Illbleed down for the Dreamcast.
[397:46.98]Did I play that?
[397:48.04]Did I get one?
[397:48.96]No, that's a different game.
[397:57.12]Anyways.
[397:58.97]SirK9, thanks for the $2.50.
[398:01.70]Focustreamer lists games he has promised to keep playing to chat with literally no intention of ever playing them again.
[398:07.97]This dude is fricked.
[398:13.37]Uh, James O'Byrne, thanks for the 300 bits.
[398:15.16]Doc3660, thanks for the 250.
[398:19.41]My mom just asked why her 22 year old son is watching a 35 year old play a 15 year old game meant for 7 year olds on a 19 year old console for over 6 hours in 2020 when he should be studying 6 hours for his arts degree so he can work 8 hours a day at a Burger King for 30 years until he dies.
[398:35.16]Damn.
[398:46.76]Holy shit.
[398:47.16]That was fucking crazy.
[398:53.51]You're laughing?
[398:54.09]Yeah, because that was a crafted comment.
[398:56.55]That was a carefully crafted... Like, okay, I opened up the jar at the candle store and smelled the fresh, clean vanilla laundry one.
[399:08.42]You know what I mean?
[399:08.84]Like, ooh.
[399:10.34]Put the cover back on.
[399:15.54]That was worth sniffing.
[399:16.96]It was crafted.
[399:23.41]Thank you, Doc, for the $2.50.
[399:24.69]I'm going to keep that one.
[399:30.37]I might buy that one.
[399:33.14]I might buy that candle.
[399:37.36]And smell it once on the ride home.
[399:39.94]In the passenger seat while somebody's driving.
[399:42.74]It's like, oh yeah, that's right, I can't wait to use this.
[399:46.04]And I don't ever light it once.
[399:47.58]The candle has never used.
[399:50.59]In fact, six months go by.
[399:53.55]And I don't even know where it is.
[399:55.91]And no one knows where it is.
[399:58.35]Four years go by.
[400:01.59]Moving out of the house.
[400:03.85]You find it in a closet.
[400:05.18]And you go, whoa, whoa, holy shit.
[400:09.09]Yeah, I remember we got this.
[400:12.09]Oh, it smells good.
[400:13.52]Pack that.
[400:13.94]You pack it up.
[400:15.50]It goes into a box.
[400:18.22]Six more months go by.
[400:19.42]It's still in the box that you moved with.
[400:25.23]And the cycle repeats until you die.
[400:38.69]Put that on his shirt.
[400:44.19]Pass it to your gr- No music?
[400:46.27]Oh, what the monk, I- Eh?
[400:48.14]Whatever it is.
[400:51.96]Hey, thanks, doc.
[400:52.50]That was a great comment.
[400:55.88]Smelly boy, thanks for the 250, smelly boy.
[401:00.00]Picking up on the Alfredo talk from yesterday, I contend that spaghetti noodles outperform fettuccine as Alfredo noodles.
[401:06.92]Ehh.
[401:08.12]They're easier to come across and easier to eat with a spoon and fork.
[401:13.55]Also, do you prefer the chicken in your alfredo noodles breaded or bare?
[401:16.55]Breaded.
[401:17.81]Breaded, thinly sliced.
[401:19.91]Fettuccine soaks up more of... Fettuccine soaks up way more of the sauce and juices.
[401:28.15]You get way more sauce per bite than you do.
[401:30.11]Spaghetti falls right off the bone on the spaghetti, you know what I mean?
[401:36.65]Breaded.
[401:36.93]Yeah, breaded.
[401:37.67]Oh, yeah.
[401:38.29]Just thinly breaded.
[401:39.50]Thinly breaded.
[401:40.90]I'm not talking about, like, fried chicken.
[401:42.30]I'm talking thin.
[401:43.10]A little bit of flour.
[401:44.36]Just thinly crisp.
[401:46.28]Thinly crisp.
[401:47.80]That's it.
[401:50.56]Thin.
[401:54.71]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the $2.50.
[401:55.81]When are you going to play some Shenmue?
[401:57.71]I remember asking ages ago when you were playing Dreamcast games, and you assured me that it would be soon.
[402:03.24]And here I am, paying another $2.50 for my hard-earned dough to call you out to fulfill your oath.
[402:12.95]I own them.
[402:13.55]I bought them on PC.
[402:15.63]The reason why I didn't play them is because they were coming out.
[402:18.62]They hadn't come out on PC yet, right?
[402:20.38]Or at least 2 didn't.
[402:21.84]They remade them or something.
[402:23.06]3 was coming out, so I was like, no, I'm just going to wait until 3 comes out, and then I'll do them all.
[402:28.24]And then that took a long time.
[402:30.66]And then it came out, and 3 wasn't very good.
[402:34.53]From what I hear.
[402:36.87]And then I was like, wait, oh shit, this is not very good.
[402:40.24]Oh, and then I remember, wait, 2 and 1 aren't even very good.
[402:46.32]They're like 180 hour long games.
[402:47.96]And I was like, wait, fuck.
[402:54.80]But they are.
[402:55.24]I remember playing Shenmue 1 and had fun.
[402:57.69]You drive around in a forklift for 12 hours.
[403:00.47]Yeah, wait, do I want to play that?
[403:07.11]Maybe?
[403:07.71]Maybe.
[403:08.31]That was fun.
[403:08.91]It was fun.
[403:10.21]Joel's playing it right now?
[403:11.33]Well, you're gonna go say hello to him and tell him that I said it was 180.
[403:16.20]He's Joel playing it right now?
[403:21.62]Stream Joel's... Okay, okay.
[403:23.64]Just pretend I'm streaming when you watch Joel's stream.
[403:27.10]We're both doing it at the same time.
[403:30.25]My spirit is there in that forklift.
[403:35.15]Anyways.
[403:36.40]Peaceful Hayley gave 5,000 bits.
[403:38.32]We had $50 from Hayley.
[403:39.96]Holy shit, Hayley.
[403:43.18]More huge, insane money drops.
[403:48.00]Pog.
[403:49.94]Thank you, Hayley.
[403:51.80]Jeremy.
[403:53.06]Just kind of felt like showing my love.
[403:54.74]Have a good night.
[403:56.22]That means a lot.
[403:56.78]Thank you.
[403:57.12]That's a lot of money.
[404:00.65]Hopefully I use it well.
[404:01.54]Thank you, Hayley.
[404:02.74]Enable POG.
[404:03.48]No!
[404:04.36]It is enabled already.
[404:05.60]POG is enabled because I want to read it.
[404:08.76]PogChamp is different.
[404:11.02]POG, I want to be able to read it.
[404:12.49]It's a different meaning for me when I read it.
[404:19.51]Show Joel sneeze.
[404:21.29]Sneeze on Joel.
[404:22.18]What?
[404:23.18]How would I do that?
[404:29.93]But thanks a lot, Haley.
[404:30.83]That's a ton of money.
[404:31.81]And right after that, MechaMurf gave 1,500 bits.
[404:35.87]Thank you, MechaMurf.
[404:39.10]That'll be $15.
[404:41.18]He gave a shitload of money last night, so... Thank you.
[404:44.38]Back on top.
[404:45.34]Love supporting you, Jerm.
[404:46.24]I've been watching since 2014.
[404:47.88]It's not a contest, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
[404:50.28]Thank you.
[404:51.24]Thanks for sticking around for so long.
[404:54.06]Uh, we got Striker 2.
[404:55.08]300 bits from Striker 2.
[404:59.14]What's going on?
[404:59.62]Good to see you again.
[405:00.10]Hey Jerma, thanks for the recognition for once.
[405:03.86]I'm donating to say that striker underscore two is a fake and not me.
[405:08.28]Love watching the streams.
[405:09.14]Keep up the amazing content.
[405:10.56]I'll keep that in mind.
[405:15.96]Thanks a lot.
[405:17.32]Hey Bitslave, thanks for the 250.
[405:18.52]Hey Jerma, I was watching your VOD on Diablo II and I stopped watching because it sucked.
[405:24.15]Ha ha ha.
[405:24.57]Ha ha ha.
[405:31.75]Now, what else?
[405:33.77]Uh, just kidding.
[405:34.43]I bought it and wanted to play it with no spoilers.
[405:36.55]I've never played Diablo before, and I'm excited.
[405:38.50]It's one of the best games ever made, so I wish you the best of luck.
[405:49.22]Actually, one of the best games ever made.
[405:50.78]It really is.
[405:51.86]Truly.
[405:53.16]You're gonna love it.
[405:53.70]Thanks for the $2.50.
[405:59.37]The Dreamcast sucks.
[406:00.25]No, no, no, no, you got it wrong.
[406:02.05]It's... The Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[406:25.13]Just the culmination, that was like the 10th Dreamcast game.
[406:30.45]That person didn't have, like, no sub badge.
[406:33.27]It was just, no, nothing.
[406:34.69]It was just a name that just said, like, just fine in a Dreamcast stream.
[406:39.30]Dude, this console sucks.
[406:42.38]Everything about it makes me happy.
[406:47.82]Everything about it makes me laugh.
[406:48.79]It's a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect piece of humor.
[406:52.77]Oh, it's perfect.
[406:56.39]Those games were all so bad, I know.
[406:58.35]And that's why it's, ugh.
[407:04.51]One guy moment of the decade.
[407:05.99]It just, ugh.
[407:07.98]Because I knew.
[407:08.60]You know what I mean?
[407:09.70]Like, those Dreamcast streams, some of them were really fun.
[407:12.76]But there was one in particular that was at least three or four games in a row that were horrendous.
[407:18.96]And they weren't funny.
[407:19.91]They weren't even fun.
[407:21.43]And it just sucked.
[407:24.27]And I knew it.
[407:25.73]And like three, four hours go by and that's the message I look over and read.
[407:28.87]It's like, fuck, yeah, the Dreamcast, if that's your only view of the Dreamcast, the Dreamcast sucks, man.
[407:34.83]Whoa, this is what it has?
[407:35.95]This guy's streaming this shit?
[407:39.07]This guy's streaming these games.
[407:41.18]It's gotta be worth playing or something.
[407:42.94]No, this game, this console's terrible.
[407:45.80]Oh, I love every second of it.
[407:47.90]Anyways.
[407:51.84]I could gush about it forever.
[407:56.75]Anyways, a jobbed bone, thanks to the 250.
[407:59.43]Jerma, how do I tell my mom I love her?
[408:03.26]Go up to your mother.
[408:06.32]And, first of all, before you do this, maybe take care of a few things around the house.
[408:15.26]Find out what your mother's got going on tomorrow.
[408:18.76]Does she have some errands that she needs to run?
[408:21.21]Do them.
[408:22.99]You don't have to say anything.
[408:55.99]Reread the message.
[409:00.59]Jeremiah, how do I tell my mom I love, love her?
[409:36.20]I can't.
[409:37.84]Okay.
[409:38.78]I'm trying to give advice.
[409:40.00]Don't ever give advice ever again.
[409:42.15]Bitslave, thanks for the 250.
[409:49.09]Please play Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg and Kirby Air Ride.
[409:52.34]It's a great game.
[409:53.28]If you don't believe me, fuck me, I guess.
[409:57.08]Okay.
[409:58.10]Check out my OC.
[410:07.62]Check out my OC?
[410:09.26]What's going on?
[410:16.76]Okay, here.
[410:17.66]We'll check it out.
[410:19.66]Sure.
[410:19.98]Cool.
[410:21.22]Thanks for the OC.
[410:32.91]Yeah, Billy Hatcher the Giant Egg is on the list.
[410:35.21]Hey, Jake Lemons.
[410:41.30]Thank you, Jake Lemons.
[410:44.42]1337 for the 500 bits.
[410:47.10]Do you think, Murph, that Arabian Prince Donator would play League with me?
[410:53.77]What the fuck are you talking about?
[411:00.59]Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the $10.
[411:09.09]And here's some more money so I can get my 25,000 badge.
[411:12.31]God damn, thank you.
[411:18.41]Thanks for the 1,000 bits, Hayley.
[411:20.11]On top of the fucking huge money drop from earlier.
[411:22.13]Thank you.
[411:25.84]Uh, Sasha Green, Spider Queen, thanks for the 250.
[411:29.02]Jerma, what animal would your fursona be and what color would it be?
[411:33.48]I see slash S. That's supposed to be like sarcastic, right?
[411:37.94]Um, it was a frog.
[411:39.54]Frog.
[411:40.06]I'm a frog.
[411:41.64]Frog.
[411:42.10]Done.
[411:42.54]I already did it.
[411:43.10]A frog.
[411:43.90]A rat.
[411:44.48]I don't know.
[411:45.04]Who cares?
[411:46.62]Mecha Murph, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[411:48.73]I can't stop.
[411:49.67]I won't stop.
[411:53.29]Can't stop, won't stop.
[411:55.15]Mecha Murph, another $15.
[411:56.13]Thank you, Murph.
[411:58.09]Appreciate it.
[412:00.33]Beautiful Jen, thank you for the $2.50 times two, which is $5.
[412:07.09]Jerma, any plans to do anything from Pikmin?
[412:09.20]It'd be a real treat to watch you play one of them.
[412:10.96]Also, congrats on 10 million views.
[412:12.46]You deserve them all.
[412:13.22]Thanks for all the laughs.
[412:14.16]Yes, there is.
[412:16.20]The thing about Pikmin, I'm going to need some help on this one.
[412:19.78]I don't think I would play all the Pikmins.
[412:24.12]Pikmin as a series, to me, is... Pikmin 1 versus Pikmin 2 versus Pikmin 3.
[412:31.22]I feel like 2 is just kind of a more engrossed version of 1.
[412:38.17]A more expanded version of 1.
[412:39.25]Right?
[412:40.63]Does that make sense?
[412:42.45]Am I crazy?
[412:43.05]You guys have to help me here.
[412:43.89]2 is the one to play.
[412:48.43]Play 2.
[412:50.60]So if I just played two, then I would get a good... I'd be fine, right?
[412:59.64]I don't know about three.
[413:02.12]Two is way better than one, and three is okay.
[413:04.34]Okay.
[413:06.82]Only the second and the third.
[413:08.06]Right.
[413:10.52]Three is harder for your small brain.
[413:15.13]It doesn't matter how small your brain is, it's about how many fucking neurons are in there.
[413:18.77]And I got a lot, so please.
[413:22.61]But yeah, definitely.
[413:24.05]Pikmin 2 will be probably the one I play.
[413:27.35]Those games you're describing are not 150 hours long.
[413:28.75]There's a difference between playing...
[413:46.13]Like, cooking Mama for four hours and playing Shenmue 1 through 3 for 400 on-stream hours.
[413:52.50]I think there's a big difference.
[414:09.77]They're not that long.
[414:24.25]How long are they?
[414:33.55]50 hours.
[414:33.87]Sorry.
[414:41.70]It would take a full month.
[414:48.66]No, look, I've said this before a million times.
[414:52.08]I will never completely tell you that I'm never going to play something because I have no idea what's going to happen in the future.
[414:57.85]A couple months might go by and I'll be like, fuck it, man.
[415:00.93]Let's play Shenmue.
[415:01.69]Let's go.
[415:02.43]I don't have a plan.
[415:04.13]My plans on this stream are only, only the big projects that take a few months to put together.
[415:14.50]There are no fucking plans on this stream besides those.
[415:17.18]Zero.
[415:17.44]Zero.
[415:19.37]I don't have a game that I play any time of day.
[415:22.13]I just... Each week, each month, I'll sit down and be like, what do I feel like doing this week?
[415:28.52]What do I feel like doing in the next couple months?
[415:30.92]It's this.
[415:34.36]I can never tell you that I'm never going to play something.
[415:36.40]Because who knows?
[415:37.04]It could happen tomorrow.
[415:40.06]Is Community Content Night this Saturday?
[415:42.02]Uh-oh!
[415:43.20]Wait.
[415:43.94]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[415:46.01]Yo.
[415:47.35]Okay, hold on.
[415:48.97]I may have screwed up here.
[415:53.19]Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[415:55.43]Friday would be four.
[415:56.47]Oh, well.
[416:05.48]Community Content Night is... gonna be moved...
[416:12.76]Not far, not far.
[416:14.14]Only a couple days.
[416:15.50]Only a couple days.
[416:16.22]Only a couple days.
[416:19.03]Would you rather have community content on a Tuesday or on a Saturday or Sunday?
[416:28.39]Which one?
[416:28.73]What would you prefer?
[416:31.87]Tuesday or a Saturday or Sunday?
[416:33.39]Which one?
[416:33.89]Sunday?
[416:34.21]Weekend?
[416:34.65]Sunday?
[416:35.39]Like on a Sunday?
[416:36.15]Okay.
[416:37.81]Alright.
[416:43.83]The real date for the next community content night, and I, this is, I screwed up some planning here.
[416:49.21]It's because I had to, I had some shit to do.
[416:53.93]The real date for the community content night will not be March 1st.
[417:00.77]It's gonna be March 8th.
[417:02.72]Sunday, March 8th.
[417:06.20]We're gonna have a lot to go through.
[417:08.57]I never plan.
[417:09.55]There you are.
[417:10.48]There you go.
[417:12.58]In motion.
[417:14.10]In motion, you're seeing these things.
[417:21.44]Thank you, King.
[417:22.30]Why are people doing that now?
[417:24.54]I've seen that a lot.
[417:25.40]Hey, when's this happening, King?
[417:28.10]Oh, that was so good, King.
[417:29.68]I've seen that a lot.
[417:30.48]Is that a thing people are doing now for fun?
[417:33.28]I keep seeing it.
[417:37.29]Anyways.
[417:38.67]Yeah, it's not gonna lie, because we're doing, like, four or five days in a row.
[417:41.73]At least four days in a row here.
[417:44.36]And I have some stuff that I have to do on the weekend.
[417:46.88]So, I fucked up.
[417:48.38]I don't... Hey, no plan... Nancy, whatever you want to call me.
[417:54.86]Anyways, we're almost done with the bits here.
[417:56.06]We have... Uh...
[418:02.89]Goo Berry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[418:04.53]Heyo, Dr. 985.
[418:05.41]Just wanted to donate tonight.
[418:08.15]Just wanted to point out that one of the funniest things chat does is when they point out games no one has ever played, but just talk about it like it's the best thing ever.
[418:16.96]Like I saw one guy call you a 4 IQ idiot for not playing Stuart Little 2 on the DS.
[418:22.98]But you haven't played Stuart Little 2 on the DS?
[418:25.36]What are you, fucking dumb?
[418:30.62]What's your IQ, dude?
[418:31.28]What the fuck?
[418:33.79]Okay, well, anyways.
[418:35.15]Also, by the way, can you please play, uh, Alpha Chimp on the Xbox Live Indie Arcade game service?
[418:42.51]It's off the market now, but please trust me, it's good.
[418:44.73]I swear, Pepehands, please, God!
[418:53.10]Um... How am I gonna get a copy of that?
[418:56.97]Xbox Live Indie Game Service is offline, but get it.
[419:00.67]How am I going to get it?
[419:03.93]Please, God.
[419:04.87]God was in all capitals.
[419:07.85]You haven't played Alpha Chimp?
[419:08.91]What's wrong with you?
[419:09.63]What are you, fucking 2IQ?
[419:11.95]Excuse me.
[419:14.63]Thanks, Scoober.
[419:15.23]I just appreciate it.
[419:17.25]Please, God.
[419:18.95]Striker2, thanks for the 300 bits.
[419:20.99]Hey, Jeremy.
[419:21.53]Striker2 here again.
[419:23.43]How do I tell you that I love, love you?
[419:25.37]Well, you just did.
[419:27.55]Sorry, I'm taken.
[419:29.75]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[419:31.09]Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for the 500 bits.
[419:33.47]Do you have a mental image for us, or are we just a mindless blob?
[419:38.70]Um... Do I have a mental image for chat?
[419:42.98]I kind of.
[419:47.16]Sort of.
[419:49.73]A bunch of small talking dogs.
[419:52.69]Like little dachshunds and chihuahuas and stuff.
[419:56.13]And they all talk, everyone has like a dog voice.
[420:13.82]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[420:18.14]No, I honestly, emotes.
[420:20.54]I see you guys as like the emotes that you're currently writing.
[420:24.46]It might be a dog.
[420:25.12]It might be a smiling face.
[420:27.68]It might be a rage face.
[420:28.80]I don't know.
[420:30.97]Hey, Bitslave, thanks again for $5.
[420:33.37]Dude, fucking Billy, egg, pog, yes, fuck, yes, furry, O-W-O, I just gamer-gassed him.
[420:39.51]Holy shit.
[420:41.55]Thank you.
[420:43.50]Thank you, Jake Lemons, for the 300 bits.
[420:45.50]He's playing League with me.
[420:48.02]From MechaMurf.
[420:50.02]He's playing...
[420:53.48]Wait, what's going on?
[420:56.02]Okay, so you're playing League together.
[421:08.45]That's not me, though.
[421:10.54]Oh, this is weird.
[421:11.64]You're freaking me out.
[421:12.64]Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[421:13.80]I'm just going to throw these bits on here.
[421:15.40]My last donation was too long to just be $2.50.
[421:18.34]That's inaccurate.
[421:19.79]You can give $2.50 and say whatever you want, as long as it's appropriate and you're not putting porn codes into a fucking chat room.
[421:27.89]But thank you, Gooberry.
[421:28.61]Appreciate it.
[421:30.61]Mecca Murph, thanks for the 1,500 bits, 15 more dollars from Mecca Murph's bank account here.
[421:36.57]I'm the Arabian Prince.
[421:38.05]Jake Lemons was taught.
[421:39.35]So I got it right.
[421:39.95]I said it right.
[421:41.71]It's Jake's, less space M-O-N-Z is what he referred to it.
[421:46.12]Jake Lemons.
[421:47.46]I said it right.
[421:48.00]I was talking about playing League with.
[421:50.70]Just got back from my deployment from Jordan and Syria, so he calls me that.
[421:54.66]I'm currently playing League with him, so don't worry.
[421:58.01]Welcome back.
[422:11.00]Playing League together.
[422:14.36]Is League any fun?
[422:19.74]Don't answer that.
[422:26.69]No, you don't have to answer that because I know it's not fun.
[422:29.75]You don't have to answer it.
[422:31.59]I already know.
[422:33.59]Thank you, MechaMurf.
[422:34.47]Seriously, both of you.
[422:35.67]Hope you guys are having fun together.
[422:38.37]Aw, futz, thanks for the 500 bits.
[422:40.37]Hi, have a great night.
[422:41.65]You too, thank you.
[422:43.85]Jobbedbone, thanks for the 250.
[422:47.11]Seriously, though, I don't want to hurt what mom and I have, but I wanted to know how I feel.
[422:52.68]This is a you scenario, man.
[422:54.02]I got nothing for you here.
[422:56.84]I got nothing for you here.
[422:57.96]This is a you thing.
[422:59.72]I got nothing for you.
[423:06.84]Have a great night.
[423:08.14]Thanks a lot.
[423:10.18]Let's run those credits.
[423:10.98]What do you say?
[423:21.33]Stop the music.
[423:23.29]Yeah.
[423:25.78]Well, the reason why we stopped the music is because we're almost done with the bits.
[423:28.86]But I do want to get these going.
[423:30.10]We don't need music for this.
[423:31.98]Here come all the community subs, all the new subs, all the old subs.
[423:35.24]Every sub that happened on tonight's stream is going to run by you.
[423:39.22]There it is.
[423:40.40]Thanks again, guys, for supporting the stream.
[423:46.31]Lots of you.
[423:49.15]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[423:51.73]Every single sub from today.
[423:57.43]What a bunch of nerds.
[423:58.79]Why did you ban that person for three minutes?
[424:05.80]My sub ran out today.
[424:07.42]It's all good.
[424:07.82]Don't worry.
[424:09.68]More jelly.
[424:10.28]Thanks for the $2.50, Jerma.
[424:11.40]I'm going to go see Blade in Brooklyn in May.
[424:15.30]Can I get a win?
[424:17.00]A W?
[424:17.57]What?
[424:29.27]I guess.
[424:31.27]Is the movie any good?
[424:32.01]I don't know.
[424:32.91]We'll see.
[424:33.99]Thanks for the $2.50.
[424:39.24]Bitslave, Bitslave just came in with 50 more dollars, 5,000 bits, going nuts on the bits here.
[424:49.21]They say, support the troops stream at MechaMurf and I need you to play League of Legends.
[424:53.99]Also, the gamer drink of the day is Guinness.
[424:57.07]Good smooth beer, drink it now if you're of age.
[424:59.72]Remember to game on, gamers.
[425:01.46]Game the F on.
[425:02.24]Also, four more days and I'm unbanned from League.
[425:04.84]Can we get some fucking pogs in the chat?
[425:08.37]LOL Tyler1 sponsored this message.
[425:11.69]I don't think he did.
[425:12.27]He's drinking again.
[425:18.01]He's drunk again.
[425:21.72]Don't play League drunk.
[425:23.24]That's the number one thing.
[425:24.56]Don't do it.
[425:27.92]Guinness.
[425:28.54]No, I don't drink Guinness.
[425:29.52]It's liquid bread.
[425:31.02]Not for me.
[425:43.88]I can't play League.
[425:45.00]I'm not playing League.
[425:46.12]It's not gonna happen.
[425:48.91]It's not gonna happen.
[425:49.65]I'm never gonna play League.
[425:50.97]It's never gonna happen.
[425:51.67]I'm sorry.
[425:53.07]Jerma only drinks wine.
[425:55.05]I mean, I like wine.
[425:56.65]Red wine.
[425:57.11]It's fucking good for you.
[425:57.97]Polyphenols.
[426:01.49]Any polyphenols in liquid fucking sourdough?
[426:04.67]I don't think so.
[426:10.45]Thanks a lot for the 5,000 bits though, Bitslave.
[426:12.85]Really.
[426:17.39]More jelly thanks for the yardie, did it?
[426:21.37]That's it.
[426:21.77]Good for you, you wino.
[426:33.90]Wino.
[426:38.92]Bits lay 1,500 bits right at the very end.
[426:42.36]$15.
[426:42.38]Jeremy, you make me cry if I saw one game as Grandpa Diarrhea running down mid.
[426:46.91]Was that my name in League?
[426:51.27]My name in League was Grandpa Diarrhea?
[426:54.87]Am I allowed to have that name?
[426:56.07]Why was I allowed to have that name?
[426:57.31]This seems weird, right?
[427:04.32]Alright.
[427:06.40]We'll see you tomorrow for more Chibi-Robo.
[427:08.04]Try to finish it tomorrow.
[427:14.41]Uh... Ster is streaming right now.
[427:18.66]We're gonna go say hi to Ster.
[427:22.30]Is he doing a custom workshop balance?
[427:24.11]I don't know.
[427:24.61]Apparently he's sick.
[427:27.45]He's sick.
[427:28.11]Hopefully he's not too sick.
[427:31.65]Go show Ster some love.
[427:36.89]He's playing Overwatch.
[427:39.13]I don't know how vile that word was to you all.
[427:46.76]Were you going to raid Joel?
[427:50.08]Just hop around.
[427:52.24]I never catch Star when he's streaming.
[427:53.74]He's always not streaming when I stream.
[427:56.06]I want to say hi.
[427:57.28]I want to say hi to Star.
[428:02.41]Good.
[428:03.35]Bye.
[428:03.63]See you tomorrow.
[428:04.83]Good night.
[428:15.77]you
[428:46.30]Thank you.
