[00:45.66]Wow Well, that was this has been a real pain, but here we are fine.
[00:52.71]Good evening.
[00:53.51]Hi everybody Hi, y'all doing hope you're doing a great great day.
[00:58.71]Hope you're doing a great day We've got some dinosaur games to play it is officially dinosaur week According to what you've seen on the pole and what you're seeing on here.
[01:10.40]Oh
[01:13.82]Not live on mobile, but we're gonna give it a few seconds.
[01:18.72]So, here's what I did.
[01:20.88]I went on Amazon and I bought a bunch of old games.
[01:22.54]I bought a bunch of old dinosaur games, a bunch of old game show games, a bunch of old fucking games.
[01:26.42]Right?
[01:28.06]And we're gonna play them all.
[01:30.26]Over the course of the next few days.
[01:32.27]Depending on how, like, fun these things are.
[01:34.65]They might be so bad that we have to, like, move on to something else.
[01:37.77]But, I have so many games.
[01:40.23]So many old PC games.
[01:44.16]We're going to start with... So we're going to play Carnivores tonight.
[01:46.98]The original Carnivores.
[01:49.56]I have the original Carnivores installed, but I can't stream it.
[01:52.88]I have Carnivores Ice Age installed.
[01:55.30]I can't stream it.
[01:56.76]But we have Carnivores Cityscape, which is like the third expansion.
[02:02.71]And this one works.
[02:04.61]This one is streamable.
[02:06.03]So we're going to start with Carnivores Cityscapes and see how this goes.
[02:12.48]I also have a couple other ones that are ready for tonight if we need to move on.
[02:14.92]We've got a couple of other dinosaur themed games.
[02:19.90]Just give me one second, guys.
[02:20.80]I'm going to make a tweet.
[02:21.70]I'll be right back.
[02:49.02]Alright, let me just get myself situated.
[02:51.94]Hopefully this game is, like, fun for, like, at least an hour.
[02:55.24]I hope so.
[02:58.01]Let me switch over here.
[03:00.61]And it should... Hey!
[03:02.03]How are ya?
[03:02.69]Look at that.
[03:03.11]You're gonna hear some sounds now.
[03:07.87]I hope.
[03:08.79]I hope you're gonna hear some sounds.
[03:12.11]This is the first dinosaur game that we're gonna play.
[03:17.07]Carnivore Cityscape.
[03:18.29]Apparently like dinosaurs invade the city.
[03:22.17]I guess.
[03:23.57]We're gonna have to find that out.
[03:24.79]So let's turn the music up a little.
[03:30.41]This music is so bad already.
[03:33.71]But this is like one of the last expansions, I believe.
[03:37.35]For Carnivores.
[03:39.12]How do we do it?
[03:39.68]Is that two?
[03:40.30]No, I don't want to see the credits.
[03:44.75]Let's just go audio.
[03:45.65]Let's drop it again.
[03:47.18]That's a little too much for my brain to handle.
[03:51.10]Single player.
[03:52.42]Okay, so what species do I want to be?
[03:54.22]Do I want to be dino or do I want to be agent?
[03:58.80]Dino or agent?
[04:03.39]I think we're going to have to start with... We don't start immediately as a dinosaur.
[04:09.41]Do we start as dino?
[04:10.91]Well, this is dino week.
[04:11.79]You're right.
[04:12.35]New campaign.
[04:13.85]Dino.
[04:17.46]Okay.
[04:18.10]The crash site.
[04:19.56]Escape the crashed ship to the safety of the dense forest at the end of the canyon.
[04:23.55]Be careful of the humans trying to hunt you.
[04:26.39]The type of dinosaur that I am is a... Calliphyosaurus.
[04:30.87]And he's very fast and he's very small.
[04:34.99]Alright.
[04:38.56]This might be loud.
[04:39.48]I don't know.
[04:41.10]Is this too loud?
[04:41.80]So I have to avoid the humans trying to hunt me.
[04:51.04]Is that a human that's trying to hunt me?
[04:53.02]I think it is.
[05:00.85]How do I eat him?
[05:01.95]Use the E key?
[05:06.09]Oh yeah, he was delicious!
[05:11.84]Do I just sit here and eat him?
[05:14.36]Oh, this is sick.
[05:15.26]How much can I eat?
[05:21.11]I'm kind of a little dinosaur.
[05:22.45]I feel like I could eat a lot.
[05:27.91]This is just spore.
[05:31.03]Okay, where's my health?
[05:34.54]Do I have, like, full health?
[05:35.48]I gotta go this way.
[05:38.26]Well, there's the speed.
[05:39.00]There's, like, how you'd go real fast.
[05:40.30]What the fuck is that noise?
[05:44.82]What is that noise?
[05:46.40]Is that this guy, like, coming at me with a gun?
[05:47.75]Yeah, it's this guy.
[05:54.40]Eat him!
[06:00.27]This is so awesome.
[06:02.75]Okay, we got- okay.
[06:03.91]I got enough health.
[06:06.05]Listen to these cool sound effects.
[06:07.49]There's the jump.
[06:12.32]What else can I do?
[06:12.94]This is the forest.
[06:22.19]Make it into the forest.
[06:23.75]I think I've accomplished that much.
[06:26.27]Oh, I hear the same gun sound file.
[06:29.02]That means somebody shot at me.
[06:31.62]Do I have to kill everybody?
[06:32.54]Or do I just have to escape?
[06:33.96]I have to escape.
[06:34.78]I'm just going to make it into the water.
[06:40.93]Hey, Mr. Squishy, thanks for the ten bucks.
[06:43.15]Just finished Bloodborne for the first...
[06:50.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:51.89]This guy's not drowning?
[06:57.19]I can't eat him underwater?
[06:58.33]What the fuck is up with that?
[06:59.31]Okay, I thought the guy was just drowning.
[07:02.79]Whatever.
[07:05.79]Yeah, Bloodborne's a fucking incredible game.
[07:07.47]I'm glad you're playing it.
[07:08.51]I'm glad you beat it.
[07:09.13]It's probably one of my favorite games of all time.
[07:13.41]Different gun sound confirmed.
[07:14.53]Yeah, that's true.
[07:16.22]I think I have to go in the water.
[07:20.85]I'm gonna have so many viruses by the end of Dino League.
[07:26.07]Is there, like, a save?
[07:27.89]No, there's a stop game.
[07:33.77]Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[07:40.32]No!
[07:41.20]No!
[07:41.88]Come here!
[07:45.88]Come on, die!
[07:46.24]Nice, eat him.
[07:49.37]So, my health is the lower left.
[07:53.41]Okay, I'm pretty much back to full... No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[07:59.91]Wait!
[08:00.53]Wait, please!
[08:01.11]Please!
[08:02.32]Why is he shooting with one hand?
[08:03.58]It's okay, it's okay.
[08:07.20]He's delicious.
[08:12.82]We haven't even started, guys.
[08:13.98]This is cityscape.
[08:15.46]I think we gotta go this way.
[08:20.50]I'm surprised I didn't die from that.
[08:24.64]Hey, we're kickin' off Dinosaur Week right!
[08:27.78]Kickin' off Dinosaur Week right with Cityscape!
[08:33.19]Do I have to be afraid of other dino- Wait, so I'm like a failed experiment?
[08:35.81]Is that how this works?
[08:39.75]I think I'm going the right way.
[08:42.09]One of these is like a punts.
[08:51.84]I'm, like, sliding around him right now.
[08:53.26]I'm not doing this.
[08:54.60]I'm gonna fucking throw up from this.
[08:57.81]Okay, he's good.
[08:59.17]That guy didn't hit me once.
[08:59.99]Hey, thank you, Supit, for the 304... God, 342 bits.
[09:06.39]Thanks, man.
[09:07.21]Thanks for the $3.42.

[09:08.55]Okay.
[09:08.77]Ooh, look at this.
[09:10.25]Dude, I bet you back in, like, 1997, this was a huge deal.
[09:19.78]A working waterfall?
[09:21.31]Are you kidding me?
[09:27.59]I'm stuck in the... Okay, don't get too close because you can get stuck inside them.
[09:31.51]Where'd he go?
[09:31.95]Where the fuck is this guy?
[09:33.71]Where did he go?
[09:37.81]He's just shooting from inside the land.
[09:40.61]What?
[09:40.97]Okay.
[09:41.45]Where...
[09:50.76]Is that him?
[09:51.86]That's not him, is it?
[10:02.11]I think that was him.
[10:03.13]Shit, I'm in a lot of trouble.
[10:04.29]Hopefully this is it.
[10:04.93]The guy is just like floating around.
[10:11.82]This is where I gotta go.
[10:12.74]Please don't have any other people here.
[10:14.18]I couldn't eat that guy.
[10:14.84]He was in the water.
[10:15.46]Is it like a sneak?

[10:37.64]There's not two of them.
[10:38.28]There's one guy.
[10:41.24]God damn it.
[10:43.78]How do I do anything about this?
[10:50.06]He might be so stupid.
[10:51.13]He might be so fucked up that I can just kill him.
[10:53.25]Come on.
[10:55.05]Come on!
[10:56.01]Nice.
[10:56.69]Eat him.

[16:51.30]Any of you guys have any idea what we're looking at here?
[16:54.82]Open up the map.
[16:57.72]Yeah, that's real helpful.
[16:59.88]The virtual boy.
[17:02.32]With the tiny little goofy dinosaur on it.
[17:04.60]I can't look at that.
[17:12.24]I guess we go over here?
[17:14.48]Eat him.
[17:24.21]It's the Death Star.
[17:27.03]I mean, it really like could be.
[17:35.76]I think I just have to get rid of everybody, right?
[17:39.47]Oh, wow.
[17:40.15]That, you know... That was incredible.
[17:45.67]Evacuation incomplete.
[17:48.11]Proceed to the nearest transport.
[17:52.19]Evacuation.
[17:52.93]Can he shoot through the glass?
[18:01.33]Get over here.
[18:01.83]I don't want to have to have you shoot me when I get over there later.
[18:04.99]Come on.
[18:09.88]Come on, get over here, you need one hit.
[18:11.74]Fine, I'll do it the right way.
[18:20.50]God, I was gonna say, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[18:24.66]Ball hacks?
[18:29.31]I gotta use my dino vision?
[18:33.97]What is dino vision?
[18:43.23]Okay, uh, I guess we gotta go this way.
[18:46.61]Well, there really is just Virtual Boy, again.
[18:50.81]I can't open this.
[18:58.22]Go this way and go, like, up?
[18:59.70]I guess.
[19:01.36]Dino vision.
[19:05.60]What does this achieve besides making it worse?
[19:09.26]Oh, there's the lead scientist.
[19:12.30]Okay.
[19:27.56]She just fucking screamed and turned and I swiped her leg and I win the game.
[19:36.74]What the fuck?
[19:37.16]I don't want to play Half-Life 4 Dinosaur Edition.
[19:41.92]The reactor.
[19:43.50]Now that you have fed, you are in desperate need of warmth.
[19:45.70]Seek out the reactor room where the heat will revitalize you.
[19:53.05]No, I don't want to play Half-Life anymore.
[19:59.53]Okay, well, let's whatever.
[20:05.01]Just waiting for the little scientist to come over and be like, Mr. Frieden, you're currently a dinosaur.
[20:11.19]No matter.
[20:12.45]We'll fix you right up.
[20:13.93]Oh, get out of there, headcrab pet of mine.
[20:16.89]Oh, he has his teeth removed.
[20:19.01]He'll be fine, Gordon.
[20:20.09]Don't worry.
[20:22.69]Gordon, do I go down here?
[20:32.22]I don't think I go down here.
[20:35.98]Oh no.
[20:37.16]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[20:41.96]Hello?
[20:44.60]The fuck was that?
[20:50.52]Do I have to restart the mission?
[20:55.56]That was a very long fall.
[21:00.73]Stop.
[21:00.99]I don't want to like stop game though.
[21:03.91]I'm so scared that if I hit stop.
[21:05.36]Will this open?
[21:06.78]Can I get back up here?
[21:16.78]Uh.
[21:21.55]I can no clip?
[21:25.39]Really?
[21:25.55]Really?
[21:34.14]How do I noclip?

[21:47.71]Spawn easy Pete.
[21:50.19]Alright, how do I noclip?
[21:51.83]I gotta get back up there.
[21:58.19]Dino noclip.
[22:14.02]Type please ghost?
[22:18.14]What do you actually have to do?
[22:22.48]Please ghost.
[22:23.56]Is that going to do it?
[22:26.75]Fly.
[22:28.03]Fly.
[22:31.23]It didn't do it.
[22:36.27]Noclip1.
[22:37.45]Just go down the hill.
[22:38.33]I don't think I'm supposed to go down the hill.
[22:45.29]Let's go over here.
[22:51.15]Wait a minute.
[22:51.57]Wait a minute.
[22:52.15]Wait a minute.

[43:24.24]We already beat this.
[43:31.23]Copy, kill all.
[43:32.33]Actually, I can just do this.
[43:35.49]Alright, we're just going to fly above.
[43:36.75]We're going to be a death machine.
[43:40.56]Has he gotten another dinosaur?
[43:41.52]I got one other dinosaur and it was even worse than this one.
[43:47.00]No, not W. Not fucking W, please.
[43:51.65]This is so stupid.
[43:59.35]Someone's going to come to this stream and they'd be like, oh, wow, he's playing the classic game, Carnivore Cityscape.
[44:03.61]I love that game.
[44:04.53]And they're going to see this shit.
[44:06.59]And they're going to be like, fuck this guy.
[44:11.07]What?
[44:13.25]What the fuck was that?
[44:17.79]What?
[44:23.39]Alright, okay, alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[44:26.38]We might, we're gonna have to come back to this game.
[44:28.64]Because I don't know what just happened.
[44:29.96]So, we're gonna move on to the next game.
[44:31.04]Uh, we're gonna move on to... Uh, Primal Prey.
[44:37.00]We're gonna move on to Primal Prey.
[44:42.92]We'll go back, we'll play this game.
[44:44.40]Don't worry, we're gonna play this game again.
[44:46.82]Primal Prey.
[44:49.12]And Primal Prey, uh... You know, we can always come back here after and, you know... Actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:55.18]I wanna see.
[44:56.40]I'm curious.
[44:58.00]Because, first of all, let's break this down.
[44:59.80]So... You get to play as a dinosaur or an agent.
[45:04.43]If you play as a dinosaur, you play as one piece of shit dinosaur.
[45:10.13]Like, what happens if you play as an agent?
[45:16.18]Do we all have to fight this one shitty dinosaur?
[45:20.56]And we're going with sniper rifle.
[45:27.31]Sniper rifle and grenade launcher.
[45:32.17]So what do we have to worry about?
[45:33.85]Oh, fuck me.
[45:49.28]Okay.
[45:49.79]Thermal imaging of the sector indicates dinosaurs have escaped the broken ship.
[45:52.71]Clear the valley of dinosaurs.
[45:57.55]Sniper rifle and grenade launcher.
[46:02.08]And please ghost.
[46:05.34]Please fly.
[46:06.50]Okay.
[46:10.14]Now we're good.
[46:13.83]I'm

[46:21.41]Kim, I love you.
[46:22.25]Come on.
[46:23.51]What are you talking about?
[46:24.59]I told you you were my number one.
[46:28.63]I told you that I love you.
[46:29.43]Come on.
[46:29.98]I love you.
[46:30.38]I love you, honey.
[46:32.18]No.
[46:32.80]I do.
[46:33.82]She's great.
[46:36.46]She's great.
[46:42.71]So, I just have to sit on the Lord of the Rings bunker?
[46:50.21]I don't understand.
[46:51.39]Do we just defend the castle?
[46:57.25]I mean, the music is playing.
[46:58.37]Does that mean... Does that mean anything?
[47:07.20]I want to see the one dinosaur that... Wait, I remember that's it.
[47:10.14]I'm doing it from a different camera angle.
[47:11.66]Remember the waterfall?
[47:16.78]Okay, I don't think this is fall damage.
[47:18.04]I don't think it matters.
[47:20.93]No, there's no fall damage.
[47:22.41]This should don't matter.
[47:23.71]Just fall down.
[47:34.50]Just ride the waterfall.
[47:35.62]Okay.
[47:38.94]This is a real boring job.
[47:48.51]That's it.
[47:48.97]It's gonna be my character.
[47:50.48]The one shitty dinosaur is gonna run over here.
[47:54.14]Game dev is in the chat.
[47:56.92]Please.
[47:59.44]Please.
[48:01.20]There's no carnivore cityscape dev in the chat.
[48:06.51]Running will attract more dinosaurs.
[48:08.25]Walk to be stealthy.
[48:12.07]That's it.
[48:12.31]Don't I want to attract... I'm not hunting dinosaurs.
[48:15.73]I'm like trying to find them, right?
[48:22.26]I can- I mean, I can hear- Well, there it is!
[48:30.35]I did it!
[48:30.69]I win!
[48:33.43]That was my get- Wait, whoa!
[48:37.40]I was being followed.
[49:00.71]That grenade not gonna blow up, huh?
[49:02.01]I was gonna say.
[49:04.63]Oh no, here come more baby dinosaurs.
[49:07.11]How come I didn't have more than one?
[49:08.21]Is that a soda can?
[49:10.23]Oh no, it's ammo.
[49:13.67]I don't think they can hurt me.
[49:16.13]Nope.
[49:17.21]Can't hurt me.
[49:19.07]I don't take damage.
[49:19.93]Oh, wait, wait.
[49:24.45]There we go, god mode is off.
[49:28.10]Alright, where is he?
[49:42.61]Oh man, I kinda wanna keep playing as an agent.
[49:45.41]The agent's like a little bit more fun.
[49:54.40]I don't even need to scope in.
[49:59.51]Why would I scope in?
[50:00.71]This is so easy.
[50:01.55]You don't die today.
[50:05.45]No, not today.
[50:06.13]Take it.
[50:09.15]Take it.
[50:28.28]No wonder this was taking so long.
[50:29.72]This gun's so bad.
[50:32.62]That took so long.
[50:37.13]They are cute.
[50:37.63]They are cute, but I feel like I was a lot smaller, a lot bigger than that, though.
[50:43.37]I mean, I can't... I really just want to skip to the end.
[50:47.75]And be, like, a fucking... Fighting, like, a T-Rex or something.
[51:06.98]Hey, thank you, Quigsy.
[51:09.80]Fun fact, one of the devs of this company created the Gabriel Entertainment Makers of Robot Arena 3.
[51:14.24]Oh, that's cool.
[51:16.50]Alright, let's try the next one.
[51:17.84]We're going to try the next one.
[51:19.12]I'm seeing... Let's do next.
[51:21.12]Let's give it a try.
[51:23.70]So, give me a second here.
[51:25.32]I'm going to switch.
[51:28.02]Be careful of your ears, though.
[51:30.04]Watch your ears.
[51:31.10]Your ears might get screamed at.
[51:34.47]I mean, this is Dinosaur Week, and we don't just do one game on Dinosaur Week.
[51:41.72]We can go back to it.
[51:43.90]Are there dedicated servers?
[51:45.10]Oh, God, probably not.
[51:47.82]This one's called Primal Prey.
[51:52.22]Primal Prey.
[51:53.64]It's called Only the Cold-Blooded Survive.
[51:57.06]Whatever that means.
[51:59.57]So, be careful of your ears.
[52:02.63]I don't know how loud this is going to be.
[52:05.38]Primal prey, here he comes.
[52:08.88]I told you!
[52:09.44]Oh my god, this is such a tiny window.
[52:13.04]Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[52:16.15]I need to, like, I need to make this work.
[52:22.51]Ah, one second.
[52:24.19]Can I, like... Oh my god, this is fucking tiny.
[52:33.29]This is an old fucking game, too.
[52:35.83]Oh, blowing this up is not gonna look good, but you know, this is Dinosaur Week.
[52:42.32]Uh, I don't think this even exists on Twitch.
[52:44.38]Primal Prey.
[52:49.68]Primal Prey.
[52:51.70]It actually exists on Twitch.
[52:54.94]Well.
[52:55.92]Alright.
[52:57.28]Primal Prey.
[52:59.72]Here we are.
[53:01.24]Let's go ahead and get in here.
[53:02.19]OOOH!
[53:03.39]Options, options, options.
[53:04.69]Where's the audio?
[53:05.55]Hold on.
[53:06.19]My lord.
[53:06.95]I mean, seriously, it's fucking 2017.
[53:10.41]You think, like, developers would figure this out by now, right?
[53:15.23]No, I don't even know what I'm pressing.
[53:18.71]Stasis?
[53:19.19]I don't even know what the fuck that was.
[53:22.95]Uh, what was it?
[53:24.61]It's gonna be P. I don't even know what it is.
[53:27.57]Okay.
[53:28.17]So.
[53:30.87]Let's get this going.

[53:55.75]Episode 1, Mission 1.
[53:58.25]Art Research.
[54:00.21]Sunstorm Interactive is developing a dinosaur hunting game and wants to motion capture the movements of a Gastonia.
[54:06.67]Retrieve a live sample for them.
[54:08.23]Try heading west from the portal to the marshy fields where the Gastonia feed in the daytime.
[54:13.88]Pays 300 bet.
[54:17.54]Okay.
[54:19.16]So, try heading west from the portal.
[54:23.48]Prank pistol owned.
[54:24.70]I don't know.
[54:25.74]All this shit is so much money.
[54:27.67]Shrink ray?
[54:29.86]Rail gun?
[54:30.52]Okay, I can only do equipment.
[54:32.24]Whatever.
[54:34.60]Hunt.
[54:36.16]I must select a weapon.
[54:36.98]That one.
[54:38.45]Oh my god, this just got so much bigger.
[54:39.87]The resolution just got so much huger.
[54:43.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:44.39]The resolution just got fucking so much bigger.
[54:51.50]Hold on.
[54:59.73]What was that?
[55:02.93]It's alright.
[55:03.33]We're good.
[55:03.91]We're good.
[55:04.19]We're good.
[55:05.83]You guys are just gonna have to, like, see this now.
[55:10.07]No.
[55:10.45]No.
[55:10.67]This resolution is so fucking odd.
[55:13.35]I can't even get... This is like... Let's stretch this over here.
[55:17.48]Let's get this, like, stretched out a little.
[55:21.50]It's like... Whatever.
[55:22.56]Who cares?
[55:23.52]It's primal fucking prey.
[55:26.24]Activate emergency portal.
[55:27.32]No.
[55:27.72]No.
[55:28.20]Let's go.
[55:32.58]So if West from- I'm gonna throw the fuck up.
[55:37.74]Oh!
[55:40.72]Did you see that?
[55:42.18]Did you guys see that?
[55:44.12]Oh my god, this is like playing a game with drunk goggles.
[55:49.89]West from the portal, which way even is- WHOA!
[56:06.84]I seriously got I'm gonna No, which way was well West from the portal over here.
[56:25.70]I'm gonna look up here.
[56:27.14]Why is it doing that?
[56:27.92]Oh?
[56:32.55]West from the portal.
[56:37.30]If you get motion sick, I'm gonna have to warn you right now, this is not gonna be well for you.
[56:42.16]Is this coiled up shits?
[56:43.06]Do I have to, like, collect these?
[56:47.05]Oh, it's... I don't know what that means.
[56:52.33]Oh god, no, this is west.
[56:55.57]I'm gonna keep this up.
[57:02.50]Okay, west from the portal, which is over here.
[57:12.01]This is, like, hurting my brain.
[57:13.25]I'm sorry, guys.
[57:13.99]There he is!
[57:18.63]There he is!
[57:18.91]There he is!
[57:19.19]There he is!
[57:20.37]Okay, so what do I do?
[57:23.64]I'd wanna be, like, to track him, right?
[57:35.57]Hey, wait.
[57:36.69]Wait.
[57:37.65]Wait a second.
[57:39.61]Wait a second.
[57:45.81]What is happening to me?
[57:47.43]What is happening?
[57:53.51]Did I get him?
[57:55.66]What?
[57:59.50]I shot him like three times.
[58:00.96]Is that him?
[58:03.70]There he is.
[58:08.47]He ran over this way.
[58:11.74]No, that's a... Dude, how many fucking tranquilizers do I have to stuff into this guy?
[58:22.38]Is that even the right dinosaur?
[58:24.18]Yes, it is.
[58:29.31]Okay, how many does this fucking take?
[58:33.43]You gotta be slowing down soon, right dude?
[58:40.29]He's slowing down, he's slowing down.
[58:42.71]Oh shit, I'm just getting a little too woozy.
[58:44.85]How much more drugs do you have to pump in me before I fucking fall over?
[58:50.33]There's too many, too many drugs in me.
[58:55.29]No, don't suck me into the portal!
[59:08.26]I win.
[59:10.16]Right?
[59:13.92]Was that the right dinosaur?
[59:17.70]I hope so.
[59:23.54]Gotta catch him.
[59:27.27]What the hell is this?
[59:33.47]Was that the right dinosaur?
[59:36.85]I don't know.
[59:37.29]It might have been.
[59:41.69]I may have given him a little too many drugs.
[59:44.81]That is possible.
[59:48.23]So we can leave, right?
[59:49.79]Did I complete my mission?
[59:50.91]Alright, let's go.
[59:55.17]I win.
[59:58.17]Mission complete.
[59:58.67]You earned 300 bucks.
[60:00.41]Hell yeah.
[60:00.93]Okay.
[60:02.11]Mission two.
[60:02.55]This one pays 300 dollars.
[60:08.08]Can we just go to episode, like, five?
[60:10.46]The T-Rex.
[60:13.32]No, we're not ready for the T-Rex yet.
[60:14.56]Alright, mission two is to get the Styracus Aureus Rodeo.
[60:21.06]Okay.
[60:22.94]You guys can't even, like, see this.
[60:28.47]Okay, find and capture a medium-sized male styra.
[60:33.45]Try heading northwest from the portal.
[60:35.14]Okay, northwest from the portal, and we're gonna buy the shotgun.
[60:41.60]Wait, I don't have any money.
[60:42.30]Never mind.
[60:44.26]Okay, still with the crank pistol.
[60:46.38]Hunt.
[60:48.02]Back to normal.
[60:48.52]Okay.
[60:49.78]Northwest from the portal.
[60:53.40]Maybe sooner or later we'll get to move out of here.
[60:55.44]So, northwest...
[60:58.93]So, over here.
[61:00.51]This way.
[61:03.95]And here comes the vomit.
[61:06.61]Do I have any other items?
[61:07.73]I don't think I have anything else.
[61:13.84]Northwest.
[61:18.30]So, like, over here.
[61:21.54]No, that was just the same area.
[61:27.00]Can't really swim that well, though.
[61:32.09]I wonder how big this thing's gonna be.
[61:33.81]This is the only map?
[61:34.87]No, it's not.
[61:38.61]This is definitely, like, ten maps.
[61:43.73]It never gets better.
[61:50.18]Oh, I know the compass is at the bottom, but I'm trying to, like, I'm trying to alleviate everybody's puke.
[61:55.42]Because the whole world collapses on itself.
[61:58.92]Where the hell is this guy?
[61:59.62]Come on.
[62:00.96]Northwest.
[62:01.50]I don't see anything.
[62:06.79]Where?
[62:07.09]Maybe the last spot.
[62:14.11]I don't want to run all the way back to that portal.
[62:16.06]That sucks.
[62:16.68]This is just finding Bigfoot again.
[62:20.08]Oh, eggs.
[62:22.94]Oh, I found styrofoam eggs.
[62:26.07]Cool.
[62:26.65]Scan him.
[62:28.63]Got it.
[62:29.65]He's over here.
[62:33.30]What was that?
[62:37.18]Northwest?
[62:37.78]More like next next.
[62:39.14]There's a giant pinecone.
[62:42.34]That means he was in this area.
[62:44.06]Yep.
[62:45.68]That means he was in this area.
[62:46.77]He was like knocking pinecones down.
[62:58.06]Where the fuck is this thing?
[63:00.22]I'm so far up.
[63:01.12]I'm in like the mountains right now.
[63:07.20]He's not gonna be over here.
[63:08.18]This is like out of the game's plane of existence.
[63:18.99]What the fuck is that?
[63:19.73]Is that lava?
[63:25.57]I think that's lava.
[63:27.77]I went a little too far.
[63:29.15]I made it to the lava.
[63:33.01]Alright, um... Where the fuck?
[63:39.43]I saw his eggs.
[63:40.21]His little eggs were there.
[63:45.18]Well, we're gonna have to go back this way.
[63:48.82]His eggs are right here.
[63:50.24]They should be here.
[63:53.82]Where is this fucking thing?
[63:56.45]Please jump in there.
[63:58.26]I know, because then I'll have to start this all over again.
[64:00.86]I need to get my fucking $500.
[64:05.16]I'm going to get my $500.
[64:06.32]And then buy a shotgun.
[64:10.22]And then use the shotgun.
[64:13.38]By the way, I love how there's only one dinosaur.
[64:15.53]It's the one, the mission you're currently on.
[64:21.33]He's got to be near the eggs, right?
[64:29.95]That ain't it.
[64:30.79]That's not it.
[64:32.33]Right?
[64:33.13]No, it was the dinosaur that was on the ground.
[64:37.26]Hey, thank you Core Monster for the 1500 bits.
[64:39.70]Got my tax return, was gonna spend it on gas, but this is a much better investment.
[64:43.94]No, I think, well gas I think is a better investment.
[64:46.52]But I appreciate the $15 nonetheless, Core Monster.
[64:48.61]Thanks, dude.
[64:52.01]Yeah, this is just like finding Bigfoot.
[64:55.57]There he is.
[64:56.67]Found him.
[64:58.16]Alright.
[64:59.30]So I gotta sneak up on him.
[65:01.14]And I gotta stay with him.
[65:03.16]He looks like he has... Is this dinosaur aggressive?
[65:06.08]That's what I'm not sure.
[65:09.10]I don't think so.
[65:10.10]There's like two of them.
[65:12.13]They're grazing right now.
[65:13.73]That's a small one.
[65:14.63]This one's medium, right?
[65:16.63]Would you guys consider that?
[65:17.37]This is a medium.
[65:17.97]Yep, that's definitely a medium.
[65:23.36]You know what?
[65:23.64]Let's just... He's coming at me.
[65:25.48]He's actually running at me.
[65:30.10]Oh, shit.
[65:31.16]Oh, shit.
[65:31.96]Oh, shit.
[65:32.28]Now I have the whole family after me.
[65:34.04]It's alright.
[65:34.36]I'm gonna tranquilize all of them.
[65:37.32]And then we'll pick the biggest one.
[65:39.08]And the biggest one gets me the trophy.
[65:45.34]These are aggressive.
[65:46.16]Wait, here comes another one.
[65:47.40]Here comes another one.
[65:54.12]Oh shit, please don't kill me.
[65:55.65]I don't know which one.
[66:02.05]Oh, this is so dumb.
[66:03.18]I love it.
[66:03.80]This is so stupid.
[66:05.66]Oh!
[66:06.88]What?
[66:08.66]What happened?

[66:58.09]We're good.
[66:58.79]Don't worry, guys.
[67:00.77]Shit's gonna be fine.
[67:02.87]New map.
[67:03.69]We're back.
[67:06.15]We are back.
[67:06.63]We're ready to fight the dinosaurs.
[67:09.55]Uh, okay.
[67:10.21]So.
[67:12.57]We're gonna be fine.
[67:13.31]We just need to... We need to just explore this, like, hazy-ass...
[67:21.98]Okay, am I walking into... What the hell?
[67:28.06]I don't know what to say.
[67:28.70]I have nothing to say.
[67:36.64]Can you guys guess what dinosaur we're on right now?
[67:41.40]I can't move.
[67:42.16]Come on.
[67:45.84]Yeah, I feel like I need a gas mask.
[67:50.03]Why can I not fucking move?
[67:53.29]Oh.
[67:54.57]Am I not supposed to be this way?
[68:00.75]It's alright.
[68:01.01]We can walk up 90 degree angles.
[68:02.53]It's fine.
[68:08.02]Alright.
[68:08.34]We are in the search of the world's most dangerous, most unbelievably catastrophic of all the animals.
[68:15.31]Can you guys guess what it is?
[68:27.78]Let's dance to Tyrannosaurus Rex!
[68:43.43]I got him in the head!
[68:44.39]I need money!
[69:01.16]What was it?
[69:01.64]Mo-money?
[69:02.32]Somebody said money.
[69:05.18]Money is not a recognizable... I think I did it, right?
[69:09.58]How much money do I have?
[69:11.10]Somebody look up the cheats.
[69:15.45]Dinosaur bait, mine, thermal optics.
[69:17.65]I want like the... I want the sniper rifle.
[69:25.82]Your background sucks, I know.
[69:28.22]Why does it say it's 9.04, but my computer is fucked.
[69:34.54]It only works on the gun screen.
[69:36.35]Is this the gun screen?
[69:44.65]Is it?
[69:47.09]Try the shrimp ray.
[69:49.95]More money, please.
[69:53.82]Somebody said it was mo money.
[69:58.01]Somebody give me the correct cheat so I can get the fucking electric gun.
[70:07.39]Please mow money.
[70:13.31]It's a next-gen game.
[70:14.79]I need caps lock.
[70:25.62]No, I didn't do it.
[70:27.16]Mo money.
[70:28.92]Cheat activity.
[70:33.06]Music literally hurts.
[70:37.43]No, we're going in the right way.
[70:39.41]I'm going in the correct way.
[70:46.43]I'm getting him with the tranquilizer.
[70:53.80]Where was he?
[70:54.18]He was, like, down here.
[70:54.84]He was over here.
[70:55.84]Alright.
[71:02.28]Oh, you need to actually, like, put on the... You have to type in the amount?
[71:06.76]We're going to get the T-Rex with the Tranquilizer.
[71:15.05]Uninstall the game.
[71:23.00]He was like right over here somewhere, wasn't he?
[71:26.67]The swamp hurts you.
[71:32.19]Am I on drugs?
[71:33.67]I think the character might be.
[71:35.49]But me, not so much.
[71:40.20]Come on, good old primal prey.
[71:47.08]Turok is better.
[71:49.23]What the fuck are these things?
[71:55.18]I'm hearing him.
[71:55.61]Wait, I lost him.
[72:01.31]I gotta give it a va- There he is, there he is.
[72:02.61]Okay, easy, easy, easy.
[72:04.15]He's gonna be just like Jurassic Park.
[72:05.25]Watch this.
[72:06.31]Remember the velociraptors in Jurassic Park were going after all the people and fucking the doctor and then the T-Rex came and saved everybody.
[72:10.48]That's what's gonna happen right here.
[72:11.26]Watch this.
[72:13.36]The T-Rex is gonna turn around and go after the fucking velociraptors.
[72:16.78]Just like in the movie.

[74:21.62]Alright, hold on.
[74:36.29]Give me a second.
[74:39.53]I'm getting lots of mixed things here.
[74:41.93]Hold on.
[74:47.57]Here we go.
[74:48.17]Primal Prey cheat codes.
[74:51.88]Okay, when you get to the main menu, screen push F2 and type in these codes.
[74:59.78]Okay.
[75:03.28]Yeah, go to the guns and items screen and press F2.
[75:05.79]Type MOE MONEY in all caps at the prompt to get enough dough to purchase all the gear you want.
[75:14.33]This is the, what are the, what?
[75:15.81]That's what I'm doing.
[75:21.12]What am I doing wrong here?
[75:25.19]Like... I think guns and items... Isn't this what this is?
[75:28.53]Do I have to do, like, literally this?
[75:39.58]Okay.
[75:40.18]What?
[75:51.25]What the fuck is going on?
[75:55.17]That's a recognized command, but like... Now what?
[76:01.14]I don't have any money.
[76:01.98]I don't have any mo' money.
[76:10.41]Like, how do I... It didn't do anything.
[76:11.99]I have zero credits.
[76:16.92]I want the electric gun.
[76:18.77]Buy.
[76:19.01]I need more money to buy this.
[76:27.61]Got it.
[76:37.52]We're just buying everything.
[76:38.66]I don't even know what the fuck this stuff does.
[76:43.07]I don't know how to use it.
[76:44.47]Okay, we're good.
[76:45.51]Go.
[76:46.57]Time to kill this fucking T-Rex.
[76:52.47]Alright.
[76:53.41]Time for the T-Rex to die.
[76:57.79]What else do we have for guns?
[76:59.87]How do I change guns?
[77:05.33]How do you... I don't know.
[77:05.91]I don't think you can change guns.
[77:10.78]Hold on.
[77:11.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[77:14.54]Wait, I picked the shot?
[77:15.48]Wait, you can't have all the guns?
[77:20.00]Alright, we're going with the fucking electro gun.
[77:43.89]Let's go find that T-Rex.
[77:46.01]What is this?
[77:46.39]No, no, no.
[77:49.31]We gotta go this way.
[77:52.07]This is a mine, right?
[77:53.15]It's like a thermal mine.
[77:57.72]If I place this down and he just walks over it, it's gonna be fucking perfect.
[78:01.98]It's gonna lure him to the mine.
[78:04.00]And like that strawberry will pop out and he'll get sprayed with strawberry jam.
[78:06.88]And he'll get all sticky and then I can electrocute him to death.
[78:11.72]Ah, he was here.
[78:13.02]Yep, I can tell because there's a stingray here.
[78:16.12]Yeah, I can tell because there's a stingray pretzel here.
[78:18.10]Alright, we're going over here.
[78:24.83]We've got to track him down.
[78:29.13]Stasis mine.
[78:34.45]That's how mines work.
[78:35.45]Yes, yeah, I know.
[78:36.13]I know how mines work.
[78:39.89]Wait for him to listen for his call.
[78:41.55]Alright, but hold on.
[78:51.00]No, I wanted to like... Oh, I got him.
[79:33.00]I assumed that it was going to trap them all.
[79:36.66]Apparently not, though.
[79:42.72]So, we're just going to go this way again.
[79:47.13]How was I able to take the shotgun this time?
[79:50.05]We're going to do that again, and I'm going to get free reign to shoot him in the face.
[79:59.98]I love how on this last level there's just a ton of dinosaurs running around everywhere.
[80:07.47]And by a ton, I mean like three.
[80:09.45]But that's okay.
[80:11.33]And now I'm like in complete no man's land.
[80:13.09]Back this way.
[80:13.57]Come on.
[80:13.91]Let's go.
[80:17.83]Bag it up.
[80:22.86]Wherever you are, dinosaur.
[80:24.64]I have to at least kill the T-Rex before we move on to the next game.
[80:29.59]You know?
[80:32.19]This is dinosaur week.
[80:36.03]I would be... If I wasn't going to get you guys at least one T-Rex kill... Somewhere in this week... Then I would be... I'd be doing a disservice to you all.
[80:47.58]Where the fuck is this thing?
[80:54.84]It's just not over here.
[80:55.72]Okay.
[80:56.18]That's fine.
[80:58.25]I'm going to trap him with the stasis thing.
[81:00.56]And he's going to die.
[81:01.96]And I'm going to be... Everyone's going to be cheering my name.
[81:12.83]Alright, well... Alright.
[81:14.67]Well, we're going to walk straight this time.
[81:16.15]Did I just hear a Street Fighter sound?
[81:24.98]Street Fighter.
[81:25.84]Yeah, they use like the...
[81:28.56]They used, like, Guile's uppercut.
[81:32.12]Guile's in Street Fighter, right?
[81:34.72]Why do I not think that Guile's in Street Fighter?
[81:39.48]Of course he is.
[81:44.76]Alright.
[81:45.28]It would be nice if he came out.
[81:46.26]It would be really nice if he came out here, T-Rex.
[81:49.07]I'm really starting to get annoyed that you're not here.
[81:53.11]What are we even looking at here?
[81:55.39]I'm, like, in the exact spot that I need to be in.
[81:59.57]T-Rex eggs?
[82:01.97]No, these are just dumb Stegosaurus eggs Where is he?
[82:10.54]Come on It took me like 10 seconds to find him all those other times Did the game crash so many times that it deleted him from the game?
[82:26.38]The T-Rex was deleted.
[82:27.58]He crashed out of the game.
[82:29.76]I know the feeling, man.
[82:33.79]There he is.
[82:34.63]Okay, here we go.
[82:35.87]What on Earth is he doing?
[82:40.23]What an idiot.
[82:41.31]You're so dead.
[82:44.31]Got him.
[82:44.57]That didn't do anything.
[82:48.59]Yeah, it did.
[82:49.83]Yeah, it did.
[82:50.09]It froze him.
[82:52.15]Alright.
[82:52.97]See you in hell!
[83:06.32]See you in hell!
[83:32.29]Wait, what?
[83:34.26]What am I doing to him?
[83:38.70]Oh shit!
[83:50.98]He's gonna fucking run out of steam soon right?
[83:53.24]Do I have another stasis mine?
[83:59.00]I do.
[84:05.25]He's just like running around like, yay!
[84:08.67]Uh... Okay, I have another electrocution gun.
[84:14.77]He's gonna fall asleep over here and I'm gonna get him.
[84:24.14]Do I have him tracked?
[84:25.00]I mean, even if he's a T-Rex, he just inhaled.
[84:32.66]He just fucking inhaled like 12 shotgun tranquilizers to the face.
[84:38.85]There he is.
[84:39.17]He just fell over.
[84:42.21]He just fell flat on his face over here.
[84:47.99]Yeah, we got him.
[84:49.64]We got him.
[84:52.44]There, see?
[84:53.30]Now nobody can tell me over the course of Dinosaur Week that I didn't get a T-Rex.
[85:00.02]All you guys are gonna be like, yeah, you did like a whole week of dinosaur shipping.
[85:03.26]You didn't even catch a T-Rex.
[85:04.44]And I'm gonna be like, yeah, I did.
[85:05.96]Here he is.
[85:06.28]Alright, get him.
[85:12.93]Got him.
[85:18.49]Got him.
[85:21.90]Yeah!
[85:23.88]Nobody can say I didn't get it.
[85:27.82]And now time to get out of here.
[85:32.97]Alright, what's the last one we're doing?
[85:38.93]I want a huge flying one, right?
[85:42.01]T-Rex.
[85:42.54]Yeah, I already got a T-Rex.
[85:43.98]T-Rex theory.
[85:48.16]Wait.
[85:48.68]Okay.
[85:49.32]T-Rex capture.
[85:50.26]Yeah, whatever.
[85:52.58]I'm going to get a flying one.
[85:56.57]Okay, these things are pretty big, right?
[85:58.55]Which one's bigger?
[86:00.55]These ones are a little bigger.
[86:03.72]And we're going to go with the sniper rifle.
[86:05.02]Sniper rifle and stasis gun.
[86:10.61]No, sniper rifle and the rail gun.
[86:13.65]And we're going to have to go with binoculars and weapon skill.
[86:21.86]And bait.
[86:22.96]Let's go.
[86:30.16]Ugh, that is so puke-inducing.
[86:32.14]Alright.
[86:33.04]We're looking for the ones in the sky.
[86:34.24]Uh, did anybody pay attention as to where it was?
[86:41.10]Because I didn't pay any attention.
[86:45.95]What the hell was that?
[86:49.87]That was really fucking loud.
[86:53.13]And it made... Hey, hold on.
[86:56.01]Easy.
[86:56.37]Easy.
[87:10.11]Get out of here.
[87:11.21]You're not the one I want.
[87:12.19]You're not the one I want.
[87:12.97]That's a lot harder than it looks.
[87:24.64]It's a machina.
[87:25.82]Machina kill.
[87:28.40]Okay, the sensitivity, honest to god, is way too high.
[87:40.93]Nice aim.
[87:42.57]Yeah, I got the ray gun.
[87:43.85]Let's use it again.
[87:44.41]You'll see it.
[87:44.77]This thing's so bad.
[87:51.07]This thing's a piece of absolute shit.
[87:53.38]This is like fucking $30,000.
[87:54.08]Why?
[87:54.42]Don't ever tell me I'm not gonna get like a fucking headshot like that.
[88:12.22]I just got it.
[88:12.68]Do I need to charge it up?
[88:14.86]I think it just... I don't know, let me see.
[88:18.06]No?
[88:19.18]I just let it go?
[88:24.58]Alright, I can't... I have seven minutes to do this.
[88:34.71]What is this grenade thing?
[88:36.03]What is this thing?
[88:37.21]Is this bait?
[88:38.47]I think that's bait.
[88:41.00]It's like a dino bait pulser thing, right?
[88:47.18]Going any further will break your time... What is going on?
[88:53.68]Time teleport.
[88:58.44]This thing just ran... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:00.42]I need to see that again.
[89:03.72]They're in the air.
[89:04.44]There's the portal.
[89:09.59]Um...
[89:13.95]Tag the dino.
[89:17.05]I was like running around all over the place.
[89:18.07]I didn't see anything over there.
[89:19.65]We just gotta get one kill.
[89:23.25]On one of the flying ones.
[89:26.49]Just gotta get close enough for them to pop in.
[89:29.73]And we'll be fine.
[89:30.57]Just wait until the dinosaur pops in.
[89:33.94]And then we can all scream.
[89:35.54]And I will get the flying headshot.
[89:41.66]And I will hear so many people screaming my name.
[89:46.38]Jeremy!
[89:53.11]The draw distance is way too low.
[89:55.97]I think I only have one clip left, so I better make it count.
[90:03.15]I wish I could get out of this.
[90:06.59]Come on, where are you?
[90:07.86]Where's just a flying one?
[90:08.90]I didn't pay any attention.
[90:29.63]Well, he came out of nowhere.
[90:35.67]Jeremy!
[90:37.84]Jeremy!
[90:41.30]Where am I?
[90:42.60]I just want to... Where?
[90:48.75]There he is!
[90:49.21]There he is!
[90:49.53]Alright, here we go.
[90:56.36]He went out of my draw distance.
[90:57.90]There's another one.
[90:58.68]Watch.
[90:58.94]I'll get it.
[90:59.84]Here we go.
[91:00.16]This is once for the fuck.
[91:01.30]I want to see PogChamps fucking sprayed in my chat.
[91:07.31]Stop.
[91:10.31]Hold on.
[91:10.55]Let me get to like a good draw distance so I can still see them.
[91:14.03]They keep going behind like the Truman Show door.
[91:17.83]There you go.
[91:22.64]Let me see those fucking PogChamps.
[91:34.53]Yes!
[91:35.77]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[91:36.77]That was a good shot.
[91:37.91]That was a predictable movement pattern I got.
[91:43.75]I'm just going to tag him.
[91:45.92]Toss him in.
[91:47.56]And I'll collect my $25,000.
[91:49.58]Thank you.
[91:52.76]I win.
[91:55.18]Why don't we get another one?
[91:56.10]Why don't we get one more of those guys for fun?
[91:58.37]Hmm?
[91:58.51]Hmm?
[92:00.32]Oh, did I scare you away?
[92:02.86]I win.
[92:04.00]That's all I needed to do.

[92:06.28]I win.

[92:27.49]Uh...
[92:30.65]That worries me.
[92:37.68]The T-Rex is not in this fucking cage.
[92:40.84]Even though I clearly got him.
[92:43.50]It's empty, I know.
[92:44.96]Alright, we're... Hey, alright, thanks everybody.

[100:46.98]There is, there is no swim button.
[100:54.51]Ah.
[101:06.46]Forward, yeah, uh, no.
[101:13.46]Turn left and... We don't need that.
[101:15.04]Swim up is going to be like R. Swim down is going to be F. Center view.
[101:21.50]Attack mouse one.
[101:22.42]Select weapon one.
[101:23.22]Two.
[101:23.82]B. Okay.
[101:25.60]What the hell was that?
[101:31.08]CO2 bang stick.
[101:31.90]Let's go.
[101:33.32]Two lemon sharks.
[101:37.80]Alright, you got it.
[101:42.69]Okay, here we go.
[101:47.05]I just gotta get... Okay, two lemon sharks.
[101:51.41]Have been spotted near... The beach.
[101:58.92]Don't ask me... Which way the beach is.
[102:01.40]Because I don't think it told me.
[102:05.20]I'm just gonna have to look.
[102:05.98]Okay, there's the beach.
[102:07.42]Here we go.
[102:07.84]So the two... Two hopping frogs have been shown near the beach.
[102:13.78]My heartbeat is increasing, which means I'm not sure.
[102:17.20]This is prehistoric times, so... All those prehistoric beaches with umbrellas on them that you would get dinosaur games.
[102:28.35]Okay, there's one.
[102:31.40]He just tried to sneak up on me.
[102:32.58]Why did he not bite me?
[102:33.46]That's odd.
[102:39.42]Where?
[102:40.32]Okay, I spotted one.
[102:42.01]So, what is that?
[102:42.97]How do I, like, do anything about it?
[102:48.41]Okay.
[102:53.01]Yeah, this is Jurassic California.
[102:58.38]Here he comes.
[102:58.72]Time it.
[103:00.46]Time it!
[103:01.10]Is he dead?
[103:03.18]Is he dead?
[103:09.01]Alright, we're good.
[103:09.57]There's one.
[103:10.27]One down.
[103:12.81]One down.
[103:13.69]One to go.
[103:19.01]Okay.
[103:20.23]Gotta find the other one.
[103:25.83]I got him right in his face.
[103:26.75]That was easy.
[103:27.19]Okay, there he is.
[103:27.91]The other one's right there.
[103:28.91]Found him.
[103:31.78]There's two fucking lemon wedges.
[103:33.52]Easy.
[103:36.80]Where'd you go?
[103:40.71]Easy mission.
[103:43.81]Easy.
[103:44.05]We're going to make like $35 for this probably.
[103:48.33]Where is he?
[103:49.85]Where is he?
[103:50.81]There he is.
[103:51.21]Yeah.
[103:51.87]Open your mouth.
[103:53.45]I'm going to come get you.
[104:02.21]Congratulations.
[104:03.01]You have successfully protected the beautiful beach from a pair of obnoxious sharks.
[104:07.88]The reward will let you buy a new weapon to accelerate your professional career.
[104:16.85]Okay, I gotta, like, protect scientists now.
[104:21.01]Shotgun Bangstick.
[104:25.17]Okay.
[104:27.11]Let's just go.
[104:28.21]Kill dangerous white-tipped shark disallowing the work of an archaeological diving expedition.
[104:40.39]where where is this expedition down here is there other people I mean I see the boat but I don't see any other people there he is
[105:03.69]I was just a fin, I wasn't anything else.
[105:07.35]That's my character.
[105:09.37]He bit the fin and I'm dead.
[105:11.61]This was me.
[105:15.28]I wasn't actually a person, I was just a shoe.
[105:22.88]That's actually pretty funny.
[105:24.60]Okay, well... He's down there.
[105:27.06]I shot him right in the face.
[105:41.28]Can I go further?
[105:42.70]Where the hell am I going here?
[105:43.62]Nope.
[105:46.96]I can feel him.
[105:47.46]I can sense him.
[105:48.94]There he is.
[105:50.50]Get out of here!
[105:53.65]You little shit.
[105:57.33]I think this weapon sucks, by the way.
[106:02.77]By the way, I think he went into the wall.
[106:08.14]Yeah, he went in the wall.
[106:09.18]There he comes.
[106:18.82]Come on, load, load, load, load it!
[106:21.48]This guy's a million health.
[106:22.50]I'm gonna use the other weapon.
[106:23.64]This thing sucks.
[106:26.21]That's not him.
[106:27.05]Where'd he go?
[106:28.55]That's not him.
[106:29.91]This thing's not gonna attack me, is it?
[106:31.13]I swear to God.
[106:32.99]Shit, why did I do that?
[106:33.97]Here he comes.
[106:41.33]I'm stuck on him.
[106:41.97]I'm stuck.
[106:43.54]He's too far away.
[106:47.69]I think he's too stupid to get me from over here.
[106:50.80]He's going to keep circling and come down.
[106:55.94]Come on.
[106:57.34]Come get me.
[106:59.22]Come get me, you fucking rotten bastard.
[107:05.04]Where'd he go?
[107:07.81]Yeah, this weapon sucks.
[107:09.97]Where is he?
[107:14.17]He wasn't even...
[107:16.61]Fuck, this weapon is terrible.
[107:20.88]We're using the other one, the real one.
[107:22.74]Like, a good one.
[107:24.06]Because this thing is not going to be, like, three feet in front of me.
[107:29.08]Yeah, look at how far away that is.
[107:30.20]That's so much better.
[107:34.58]I just heard a pig.
[107:36.14]Why are there pigs down here?
[107:41.30]This game is terrible.
[107:43.08]Hey, don't say that about our shark game.
[107:49.10]There's plenty... How far away does he have to be?
[107:56.65]I mean, I... I don't understand.
[107:59.07]I'm gonna try it again.
[108:09.06]Now... Yeah, come over here.
[108:10.36]Come over here so I can kill you with my bike pump.
[108:19.11]This thing is so bad.
[108:21.90]He's gonna kill me in one hit again.
[108:24.80]I shot him in the mouth and it did like eight.
[108:26.90]Okay, he's like bleeding actually.
[108:28.20]Maybe I should just run away.
[108:32.85]Is he still bleeding?
[108:36.67]Not really.
[108:37.13]There he is again.
[108:38.25]He's gonna like still get me.
[108:40.45]Like, I don't understand how I'm supposed to beat this.
[108:46.60]Are we gonna go tried and true with the CO2 Bangstick?
[108:49.54]I'm trying this one more time.
[108:54.59]I'm gonna do this one more time.
[108:59.61]This thing was good.
[109:00.35]Remember how powerful this was and how much better it was?
[109:02.63]We're gonna try this.
[109:09.04]I can't swim fast enough away.
[109:10.36]He's just gonna kill me every time.
[109:13.18]I need to like shotgun him in the face.
[109:20.36]Are you kidding me right now?
[109:23.84]Just keep strafing around him and he won't get you.
[109:25.79]Alright, this is pretty dumb.
[109:37.17]Alright, this is pretty dumb.
[109:38.53]Alright, yeah, you got me.
[109:39.63]You got me on that one.
[109:40.27]This is dumb.
[109:41.57]This is dumb.
[109:43.20]I will say that.
[109:44.94]And that didn't hit him.
[109:45.74]Okay, that did hit him.
[109:47.47]That did hit him.
[109:49.31]So... Why did it not hit him last time?
[109:53.04]Come back and do it again.
[109:54.32]I can't get bit.
[109:55.04]Just strafe underneath.
[109:56.06]Don't go up.
[109:59.58]I can't see a damn thing.
[110:03.52]There he is.
[110:03.94]Alright.
[110:04.36]Don't... Okay.
[110:07.44]Like two more times and he's gonna be dead.
[110:11.14]Don't!
[110:11.58]Please!
[110:12.27]Come on, man.
[110:13.13]Really.
[110:13.67]Don't do this to me.
[110:14.91]Do not bite me one more time and kill me.
[110:22.91]What a pain in the ass.
[110:24.83]Come on.
[110:25.27]We have to get to the great white.
[110:31.07]Fuck me.
[110:36.33]Now I'm getting stuck on the wall.
[110:38.03]I'm still stuck on the wall.
[110:43.65]Come on.
[110:46.73]Come on, you fucking idiot.
[110:48.49]Get over here.
[110:56.79]Alright, one more time.
[110:58.63]And that's going to be it, right?
[111:01.67]Don't!
[111:03.78]Oh.
[111:04.90]Okay, come on.
[111:05.58]Easy, easy, easy.
[111:06.64]One more.
[111:07.40]And we can move on to the next mission.
[111:08.90]I don't know why I would move on to the next mission.
[111:10.90]But I'm going to.
[111:13.54]Oh, god damn it.
[111:17.49]He's just walking into walls.
[111:21.27]I'm out of ammo.
[111:22.61]I have to kill him with a knife.
[111:27.63]Great.
[111:33.67]Fucking great.
[111:54.28]Oh, and when you're trying to stab him, good luck.
[111:57.34]Good luck.
[111:58.88]Good luck.
[111:59.26]We're in shark week right now, guys.
[112:01.40]No, no, no, no.
[112:02.95]Underneath.
[112:05.25]Stab him!
[112:10.25]Oh, I can't wait to fucking instantly close this game.
[112:14.96]I'm not gonna be able to close this game fucking fast enough.
[112:31.03]No, he's going to wrap around.
[112:32.59]He's going to get me here.
[112:36.47]Don't let him do it.
[112:37.29]Don't let him do it.
[112:39.65]Got him!
[112:41.93]Yes!
[112:42.95]Okay, congratulations.
[112:43.77]You protected the Archeological Expedition from the attacks of a white-tipped shark.
[112:46.59]Your palette of the tools of the trade grows.
[112:49.54]Hoopa Cave.
[112:51.22]Treasure hunting.
[112:55.08]Alright, clear with sharks.
[112:55.82]We're going to use this.
[113:00.46]Okay, good.
[113:01.48]Let's get poison on it.
[113:04.40]Kill the dangerous bull sharks so the treasure finders can start looking.
[113:11.09]You got it.
[113:16.93]I wish there were other people.
[113:18.75]This feels very empty.
[113:20.61]And although this game did come out like... Is a dolphin here?
[113:24.41]Hi, dolphin.
[113:27.89]No, I ain't gonna shoot that.
[113:30.86]Fuck you guys.
[113:31.38]I ain't gonna shoot that.
[113:32.68]I can't even see chat yet.
[113:34.45]And I already know what you guys are saying.
[113:41.87]No.
[113:42.91]No.
[113:43.27]Why would I shoot this dolphin?
[113:45.08]I don't have any reason to.
[113:47.00]See, he's like my friend.
[113:48.18]There's the shark.
[113:51.90]There he is, right?
[113:53.90]Why is it not tracking him?
[113:54.76]That's the bull shark, right?
[113:57.57]Shouldn't it be...
[114:01.15]Isn't this him?
[114:04.91]I guess not.
[114:05.45]I guess that's not a bull shark.
[114:06.71]What does a bull shark look like?
[114:07.73]I don't know.
[114:15.69]I can't see a damn thing.
[114:19.31]Ugh.
[114:23.01]Speaking of draw distance.
[114:28.38]Holy shit.
[114:33.03]Stab it to save the ammo.
[114:34.15]Well, I mean, I gotta find it first.
[114:38.52]All I see is blue now.
[114:40.18]I might have to restart the mission.
[114:41.10]I can't see anything.
[114:44.96]Just lightly tap him.
[114:49.79]Uh... For a second I thought I was in the other game and I thought that was a dinosaur.
[114:59.67]There's the boat.
[115:02.61]You gotta go to the next game to find it.
[115:05.89]This is a dolphin.
[115:08.95]Where the fuck is this thing?
[115:12.43]I really wish I could see more than... Foggy blue.
[115:15.19]Wait, okay.
[115:15.76]Here he is.
[115:16.22]Where?
[115:18.76]Where?
[115:22.16]The heartbeat is happening.
[115:23.02]He means he's close.
[115:27.18]But where?
[115:30.12]Did you guys see that flashy little heartbeat?
[115:36.43]He's going to jump right into my screen, isn't he?
[115:42.10]Where?
[115:44.16]Come on!
[115:46.48]There he is.
[115:49.57]No, that's not even him.
[115:50.51]What the hell is going on here?
[115:58.89]That's not a bull shark?
[116:08.81]Where is it?
[116:12.49]Ugh.
[116:14.39]Further down.
[116:15.43]I guess.
[116:15.95]I don't know.
[116:16.35]I don't know what direction I'm even facing, guys.
[116:26.98]I can't even tell what fucking direction this is.
[116:30.30]I don't even know if I'm up, down.
[116:31.32]Okay, I know I'm like north, east.
[116:35.30]I might as well be upside down.
[116:41.77]Yeah, it may as well be upside down.
[116:43.95]Who knows?
[116:45.75]Deeper?
[116:46.47]I'm holding F to go deeper.
[116:49.66]And nothing's happening.
[116:50.36]I'm staying in the same spot.
[116:55.50]I think I'm as deep as I can go.
[116:59.16]Yeah, the good old Prism 3D engine.
[117:02.82]You know, like Grand Theft Auto 4 was on this engine.
[117:10.88]This is the worst level yet.
[117:11.86]I feel like I'm just going through space.
[117:18.86]Alright, worst level yet, worst game yet, I think.
[117:26.25]I'm safely going to say that.
[117:27.41]Worst game yet.
[117:29.37]The other ones were, like, jokey and fun.
[117:34.81]Just go south until I hit the bottom.
[117:37.16]I can't go south anymore.
[117:37.98]I'm holding down go deeper.
[117:43.06]I cannot go deeper.
[117:44.20]This is as deep as I can go.
[117:47.26]57 feet is how deep I'm able to go.
[117:48.76]I can go up.
[117:50.51]I can't go down.
[117:56.73]This is dinosaur week.
[117:57.91]Sharks are dinosaurs.
[117:59.01]I'm running out of oxygen.
[118:08.33]I really am running out of oxygen.
[118:16.66]I mean, it's... Here we go.
[118:17.62]It's, like, blinking.
[118:21.48]But he's not even, like, here.
[118:23.38]Why has he not come to kill me?
[118:26.04]You would think that he would come to, like, get me, but no.
[118:27.96]Alright, we're gonna give this, like, 30 more seconds.
[118:33.22]Before I... Before I game sucks this thing.
[118:41.27]Yeah, I...
[118:46.59]Every time I hear that heartbeat, I'm like, oh, here he comes.
[118:53.61]No.
[118:55.75]I can't even go any further.
[118:58.68]Alright.
[118:59.38]Ten.
[119:00.66]Nine.
[119:02.02]Eight.
[119:03.38]Seven.
[119:04.82]Six.
[119:06.56]Five.
[119:08.24]Four.
[119:11.95]Three.
[119:13.07]Two.
[119:14.33]One.
[119:15.23]Alright, that's it.
[119:15.83]Game over.
[119:17.51]Game over.
[119:18.13]I can't find this stupid bull shark.
[119:23.05]All I see are dolphins.
[119:30.40]Abort this mission.
[119:31.18]Yes.
[119:37.10]Let's go back.
[119:40.52]Random mission.
[119:41.46]Here we go!
[119:42.17]Now I can pick which one.
[119:43.69]Okay.
[119:48.58]Let's see, we got a crack canyon.
[119:58.19]Okay.
[120:00.29]Alright, we got an even better one.
[120:01.71]We got a super tank.
[120:03.77]We got an improved wetsuit.
[120:05.19]We got like super fins.
[120:06.28]Okay.
[120:09.08]You know, why not give this a try?
[120:14.08]Going deep sea shark diving.
[120:26.16]It's just a blue level.
[120:32.83]Oh, here he is.
[120:33.53]Oh shit, he actually is huge.
[120:35.45]Alright, we found the fun part of the game.
[120:38.53]He's gigantic.
[120:40.57]He's fucking enormous.
[120:41.89]Actually, that kind of just... That kind of just scared the shit out of me.
[120:46.35]I'm not gonna lie.
[120:49.83]Oh my god.
[120:55.59]This is going to take forever.
[120:56.81]Alright, we saw the cool shark.
[120:58.19]Alright, let's move on to the next game.
[120:59.80]Moving on to the next one.
[121:08.16]Give me one second here.
[121:11.76]Okay.
[121:14.77]Very easily, I'm going to turn the volume off.
[121:20.39]Switching over to, this is another dinosaur game.
[121:26.91]Hold on a second, guys.
[121:28.35]I've got another dinosaur game here.
[121:37.28]I hope this works.
[121:49.56]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[122:01.86]Alright.
[122:02.76]Oh, come on.
[122:03.34]Hold on a second.

[122:09.72]Wait, what?
[122:12.54]What happened?
[122:16.04]No, no, no.
[122:17.05]This is so important for Dinosaur Week.
[122:21.99]Come on.
[122:22.99]Don't do this to me.
[122:25.51]Don't do this.
[122:25.97]This is supposed to be Dinosaur Week.
[122:27.39]This is important.
[122:30.81]Hold on.
[122:31.01]Here we go.
[122:34.06]OK, I think it's going to work.
[122:40.55]Got it, got it.
[122:43.27]Got it.
[122:46.15]Got it.
[122:48.17]This is so loud.
[122:58.40]Are you guys ready?
[123:05.95]It's so fucking loud.
[123:09.89]I actually can't wait to play this.
[123:14.46]What is it?
[123:15.78]I wonder what it's gonna be.
[123:16.66]It's gonna be SimAnt!
[123:20.73]Hey, remember like back in the... And don't tell me this isn't a fucking dinosaur game.
[123:23.93]People are gonna say, this isn't a dinosaur game, and it is.
[123:26.96]Because if you didn't know, back in the day, back when dinosaurs were around, ants and bugs were around during the dinosaur times.
[123:41.31]SimAnt.
[123:43.39]Alright, let's learn how to play SimAnt.
[123:46.89]Welcome to the SimAnt tutorial.
[123:49.59]Just follow the on-screen instructions and you will learn how to play the game.
[123:57.11]And Sim has the yellow ant that you see in the window before you.
[124:00.79]First you learn to control your ant.
[124:05.48]Try double-clicking somewhere and the ant will move around.
[124:10.14]See?
[124:10.40]Look at this!
[124:12.04]This is seriously like the crustacean period.
[124:16.25]Good, you just learned how to dig a tunnel.
[124:17.65]Try digging some more to get the hang of it.
[124:22.67]Alright, so hold on.
[124:23.51]Let me just hold on one second.
[124:27.35]Just give me one second here.
[124:29.36]Let me just go ahead and explain to you guys what happened here.
[124:33.76]Okay, the music stopped.
[124:35.04]So the reason why we're playing SimAnt right now is because I have like four more dinosaur games that we're going to play on Thursday.
[124:44.95]And the other two that I was going to play tonight, one of them is Jurassic Park Trespasser.
[124:50.98]will will not operate on a on a 20 64-bit operating system, so I'm gonna move this one to Thursday and The two of these games in fact could not run On a that's to run on like a 16-bit processor, so I have to I have to get like a copy of Windows 95 DOS box Windows 95
[125:21.12]So, Trespassers is going to be on through.
[125:22.66]I didn't want to fucking tell you what it was because Trespassers was a fucking great game.
[125:30.95]Virtual Memory, yeah.
[125:32.85]Virtual Machine, yeah.
[125:34.43]I mean, I'm currently running SimAnt on DOSBox with Windows 3.1.
[125:38.45]So, there you go.
[125:43.13]Let's go outside.
[125:44.43]That's why I'm playing SimAnt right now.
[125:46.21]This was supposed to be like the joke for Friday.
[125:53.36]Does OBS even work on that?
[125:55.26]I got it to work on... So Carnivores just didn't work.
[125:59.56]The first two games didn't work.
[126:01.92]But there are like five or six other dinosaur games for Thursday.
[126:07.52]This is the dinosaur.
[126:08.70]These two jokes were supposed to be Friday, so I had to move jokes around.
[126:14.38]Where the fuck is my aunt?
[126:15.90]Oh, he's right there.
[126:18.21]He looks like a fucking breadcrumb.
[126:26.96]That's right, now click on your enter, re-enter it in the window.
[126:28.94]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[126:34.32]Good, now here's another way to scroll the screen.
[126:36.76]Okay.
[126:41.48]Can I have technical?
[126:42.12]No, we're not going to have technical.
[126:42.99]The technical difficulties today were because I didn't anticipate that three of the games were not going to work on a 64-bit operating system.
[126:53.33]No, Dino Week is going to be a week long.
[126:56.59]It's just like three of the games fucked up.
[127:05.49]Are we playing a video game?
[127:06.74]I mean, we kind of are.
[127:12.12]This is supposed to be a joke.
[127:13.16]Well, this was supposed to be the joke.
[127:18.84]But it is imperative that I get Jurassic Park Trespasser to work.
[127:22.24]That's going to be fucking hysterical.
[127:24.26]I cannot wait.
[127:28.32]And unfortunately, I didn't have time to install a Windows 95 virtual machine.
[127:33.76]So, I didn't think I was going to have to do that.
[127:39.81]So, in that regard... I've been going for two hours.
[127:44.81]The last hour is going to be a game I didn't think I was going to have to play.
[127:50.19]But...
[127:51.93]See, Sin Man was like the joke.
[127:53.47]So there you go.
[127:53.89]There's your funny joke.
[127:55.57]And so now let's actually play the game that I was going to play like on maybe Saturday.
[128:03.32]Sin Man is actually a really fun game, by the way.
[128:07.46]But I'm going to surprise you guys right now.
[128:09.08]We're going to play something that I didn't think I was going to be playing right now.
[128:14.16]What a funny joke.
[128:15.14]Yeah, it's a fucking funny joke, right?
[128:17.98]Alright, give me one second.
[128:20.38]There's your, like, shitty joke, SimAnt.
[128:23.74]And now we're going to play the game that I didn't think I was going to have to play today, but, you know.
[128:29.53]I think it'll be worth it for you guys.
[128:32.41]I'm pretty sure you guys are going to be happy with this.
[128:39.59]Give me one more second.
[128:44.12]Spore?
[128:44.68]No, it's not going to be.
[128:45.46]It's not Spore.
[128:46.52]Yeah.
[128:48.08]It's something else.
[128:50.06]It's something else entirely.
[128:51.22]It's four for a year.
[128:53.94]Nope.
[128:55.66]You guys, there's no fucking way you would have any idea what this was.
[129:00.48]Without a doubt.
[129:01.10]There's no way you would have any clue.
[129:03.78]And that's fine.
[129:04.22]Let me just mount my C drive again.
[129:08.12]Okay.
[129:12.76]There we are.
[129:14.83]Uh-huh.
[129:20.13]Uh-huh.
[129:22.55]Okay.
[129:24.01]I have no idea what's gonna happen when we play this.
[129:27.03]But I gotta change the game name.
[129:28.61]Because this is unlike anything I've ever done.
[129:35.01]Here comes a loud noise.
[129:36.22]Be prepared.
[129:36.92]Loud.
[129:37.58]Very loud.
[129:43.34]Wait, what?
[129:48.29]Wait, what do you mean?
[129:49.13]What the fuck are you talking about?
[129:50.45]I already, I have this installed.
[129:51.93]Come on.
[129:55.87]Insufficient memory.
[129:57.41]I just did this like fucking two days ago.
[129:59.49]Oh, for the love of God.
[130:06.64]Insufficient memory.
[130:08.92]Great.
[130:12.08]Oh, fuck me.
[130:13.18]Hold on.
[130:16.29]Hey, put on this shit right now.
[130:17.70]Here we go.
[130:18.02]Hey, look at this.
[130:18.58]Look at this.
[130:18.90]Remember this fucking BRB screen?
[130:20.28]Give me a second.
[130:21.22]Like, what the fuck?
[130:22.21]I did this two days ago, and I tested it.
[130:25.03]Be right back.
[132:24.37]Hold on.
[132:25.51]That fucking music you heard, you weren't supposed to hear that.
[132:30.32]Bear with me here.
[132:33.38]It's not, no, it's not an old Maxis game.
[132:35.02]This is actually an old, uh, something else.
[132:37.33]I don't want to spoil it, though.
[132:38.89]This is something you guys have never seen before.
[132:42.31]Tidal Clown Spore Card.
[132:46.47]Uh, god damn it.
[132:50.68]I promise if I, when I get this to work, it'll be worth it.
[132:54.77]I promise.
[132:55.97]Just bear with me.
[132:57.09]DOSBox is, like, fucking up on me and telling me that, like, my, like, mounted drive... This is, like, a... This is a bunch of shit, I'll tell you.
[133:09.77]Mount C, please, DOSBox.
[133:12.32]Quit fucking with me.
[133:22.56]Turn on facecam this week with a dino costume on.
[133:25.10]Oh, that would be fucking hilarious.
[133:26.88]I wish.
[133:29.58]Planned stream.
[133:30.84]I do have a lot of planned streams, and I planned this one, but half the games didn't work.
[133:35.75]For some reason.
[133:36.67]When I installed them over the last couple of days.
[133:39.35]So, I got a couple of great fucking games.
[133:47.07]Let's try this.
[133:52.58]see uh I just you know what sometimes when you like test over and over again and it just it decides just not to work like on the on like rant like the random time that you want it to work it will not work
[134:08.78]Dude, I've opened DOSBox like 45 times in the last week.
[134:13.59]And I never got an insufficient memory to run this application inside of my virtual machine.
[134:19.25]But of course, it happens today, right now.
[134:23.07]Of course it does.
[134:24.30]Why would it?
[134:25.36]Why would it not happen like on stream when it's supposed to work after I've tested it 90 fucking times?
[134:30.14]Why would, you know, why not?
[134:31.36]Of course, of course not.
[134:43.04]allocate more memory to it.
[134:45.40]That's going to take a little while.
[134:46.42]That's going to be fucking stupid.
[134:48.40]Let me see here.
[134:51.06]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[134:58.36]Honestly, I don't even know where to go to do that in Windows 3.1.
[135:00.57]It's been like fucking 30 years.
[135:04.95]Hold on.
[135:09.57]There we go.
[135:10.45]Maybe this is it.
[135:13.93]Technical stream No, it's this will all be solved tomorrow I just didn't anticipate it and I never anticipated and I always should I Don't have anything here.
[135:26.51]I'll show you look we'll do like a tech support stream you guys here So you go so When I open it right this is I never had this issue before I literally I literally tested this fucking yesterday and
[135:43.00]Literally yesterday.
[135:45.84]And apparently now I have to reinstall QuickTime and now I don't have enough memory to run the application.
[135:55.26]Oh shit, you can't like see what that is though.
[135:58.28]And like literally nothing will open now.
[135:59.82]I don't know.
[136:02.44]I wish I had an answer for you guys.
[136:03.42]I wish!
[136:08.81]I wish!
[136:16.40]I need a better computer.
[136:17.72]I'm running Windows like C-E-M-E-N-T.
[136:22.09]I've restarted DocsBox like four times already.
[136:33.11]And now I like have to install a quick time.
[136:35.39]Yeah, it's always something, man.
[136:36.93]I swear to God.
[136:40.20]Kill DocsBox and give it more memory.
[136:42.04]I thought I did that already.
[136:45.15]Alright, well, hold on.
[136:45.91]Here's what we're gonna do.
[136:46.68]I got my, like, fucking seven disks I have here.
[136:54.90]Windows concrete.
[136:55.96]You know what I'm saying?
[136:58.16]It's like total distortion.
[137:01.72]The working directory is invalid.
[137:03.04]Oh, now this is, like, all fucked up.
[137:07.38]I can't even close out of this.
[137:08.92]Ah!
[137:13.93]Oh, back to SimAnt!
[137:16.85]What the fuck is this?
[137:17.95]Kill... Whatever this is.
[137:20.02]I don't even know.
[137:20.48]Get me out of here.
[137:23.94]I-T-M-A.
[137:24.38]Alright, I'm gonna... Quit one of my Windows applications.
[137:30.20]Like, what the fuck?
[137:33.81]And, like, sometimes it works.
[137:37.95]I have a virus now.
[137:39.27]I, like, honestly may have fucked up something in my computer just from installing all these fucking games and all these old fucking shitty programs.
[137:45.18]Alright, give me one second.
[137:49.33]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[137:50.13]I'm gonna try this.
[138:08.75]Wait, what?
[138:45.36]Wait, how long have I been muted for?
[138:47.62]What the hell was that?
[138:50.90]How fucking long was I just muted for?
[138:56.31]Hopefully I wasn't muted for that long.
[139:03.01]Nope, it's still doing the same thing.
[139:07.21]Alright, I'm gonna get all this shit situated and figured out and fixed.
[139:12.21]I'm literally going to spend the entire day tomorrow making this right.
[139:18.89]I'm going to spend literally the in-fucking-tire day tomorrow.
[139:24.65]But that's what I did today!
[139:25.69]And shit right before stream fucked up.
[139:30.02]And literally on stream fucked up.
[139:32.06]So sometimes you just lose.
[139:34.52]Sometimes you fucking lose.
[139:35.42]There you go.
[139:39.92]When you try to do, like, weird shit like this, you fucking lose.
[139:43.97]Of course.
[139:46.91]But, I thought I had it figured out.
[139:48.52]I thought I had it fixed, but I had it figured out.
[139:50.02]But apparently half of them didn't work.
[139:54.40]Ten bucks says he didn't?
[139:55.58]How long do you think it took me to set up, like, all this dumb shit?
[140:04.07]This, like, fucking stupid program manager.
[140:06.21]And, like, getting... You want a DOS box?
[140:08.81]I'm stupid.
[140:09.37]You think I know how to set this shit up?
[140:13.31]No.
[140:14.07]Dinosaur Week continues on Thursday.
[140:16.00]There's, like, another four or five games that I haven't played that I wanted to save for Thursday.
[140:19.68]And then we have the ultimate dinosaur game on Friday.
[140:26.70]And, like, watch it just fucking work.
[140:28.85]See, like, what... Okay, this is what... Watch this.
[140:30.43]Ready?
[140:31.43]I can't even open SimAnt now.
[140:34.66]I just had SimAnt open.
[140:37.72]Like, am I missing something here or what?
[140:43.55]Like, SimAnt can't even open.
[140:46.31]I don't know.
[140:48.01]Well, at least the first couple hours of the stream were fun.
[140:51.59]And then all the dinosaur games I have went extinct.
[140:56.18]Outlast 2 has dinosaurs.
[141:00.12]I did restart DOSBox and I made the memory higher as well.
[141:04.50]But Thursday, we'll come back.
[141:06.56]I might even stream tomorrow as well.
[141:08.98]Because I'm like... I had a lot of fun in the first few games, though.
[141:15.59]And there's plenty more.
[141:19.73]So, don't ask me why this shit's happening now, but it is.
[141:25.09]Well, let me close this.
[141:27.34]Hold on.
[141:33.90]That's that.
[141:36.28]We go from having so much fun to technical difficulties ruining streams.
[141:42.67]Tagline me as like, Jerma985, dash, fun stream for like two hours, and then a bunch of dumb shit technically happens, and he can't stream anymore.
[141:55.24]It's just like, fuck my face, man.
[142:03.10]But I'm literally going to spend every second of tomorrow making sure that this doesn't happen on Thursday.
[142:10.17]Literally every single second that I'm awake on Wednesday is going to be making sure that this does not happen on Thursday.
[142:20.44]And if it don't work, I'm calling Bill Gates.
[142:22.62]I'm going to fucking call him on his cell phone.
[142:25.84]And be like, excuse me, Mr. Oh, excuse me, Bill Gates, yeah.
[142:28.70]Yeah, Jerma985 here.
[142:30.78]Why does my virtual machine DOSBox version that I didn't pay for, 3.1, Windows, why does it not work?
[142:42.18]And he's going to be like, what are you fucking talking about?
[142:44.10]It's four o'clock in the morning.
[142:45.40]I'm trying to sleep.
[142:51.57]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[142:54.05]I'm gonna stream tomorrow.
[142:55.42]We'll play something else.
[142:56.38]Dinosaur Week is gonna continue on Thursday.
[142:59.50]Bye-bye!
[142:59.92]Sorry we end like this again.
[143:03.44]But... I wish it didn't end like this.
[143:09.51]We're having so much fun.
[143:11.01]But, you know.
[143:15.13]Much love.
[143:17.21]Thanks to everybody that stuck around for the couple hours we got Dinosaur Games to work
[143:23.37]Thursday's gonna be fun, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[143:25.60]We're gonna play something tomorrow, and I'll make sure it's gonna fucking work.
[143:29.84]Take care, everybody.
[143:30.50]I'll see you soon.
[143:32.00]Have a good one.
[144:20.44]you
