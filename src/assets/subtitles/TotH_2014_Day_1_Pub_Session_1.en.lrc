[02:28.35]Thank you, Star.
[02:30.79]What a great guy you are.
[02:31.81]I feel like a winner.
[02:34.08]That's like the most expensive victory.
[02:37.21]It is for the kids.
[02:38.41]Hashtag for the kids.
[02:40.69]As that puts our total number over $33,000.
[02:45.30]Hooray!
[02:47.10]We are $2,000 or $3,000.
[02:48.64]Let's say $36,000 was the number from last year.
[02:51.97]We are $3,000 away from breaking last year's record, which if you guys are still counting at home, we have plenty of time.
[02:59.36]An $101 donation from Anonymous.
[03:03.18]I'm guessing that was you, Mr. Jerma.
[03:05.72]Oh, did I not do it right?
[03:07.40]Is the comment, is the comment he he he he he?
[03:11.73]Uh, yep.
[03:13.49]Okay, yeah, that's me.
[03:14.51]Oh, no, it does say Jerma.
[03:15.38]It just didn't show up on screen.
[03:17.04]And we have a $250 donation from Gosia!
[03:25.73]Second donation in, like, 30 minutes, if you hear the sirens.
[03:29.21]Wouldn't be the cast without that.
[03:31.98]Gosia says, for $250, Jerma, will you marry me?
[03:36.52]$250?
[03:40.72]The 250's already donated.
[03:42.34]He just wants to know, or she wants to know, if you'll marry him or her.
[03:46.43]I can't tell from the name, so... Yes!
[03:48.73]I will!
[03:49.63]Nice!
[03:51.50]That's us walking down the aisle.
[03:52.90]Matchmakers of TF2.
[03:56.82]Thank you very much, go see ya.
[03:59.81]I'm married to everybody.
[04:02.29]That's... not allowed.
[04:04.57]In Utah it is.
[04:05.89]He doesn't live in Utah, he lives like really far out of Boston.
[04:15.16]I can't get in the server.
[04:17.37]Someone should be kicked for you.
[04:20.07]That's mean.
[04:23.16]Do we have anybody in the mumble that's actually playing right now, or is this just PubPum?
[04:27.74]I'm trying to get in.
[04:29.80]I think I just got in.
[04:31.21]Nope.
[04:32.01]I was going to say, I'm sure like 100 people at least are trying to get in.
[04:35.59]Whatever.
[04:38.22]People are asking in chat, so what next is...
[04:41.84]What is next is the B-Ball tournament.
[04:45.45]This is going to be pubbing until then.
[04:46.75]So the B-Ball tournament is at 6 o'clock Eastern time.
[04:50.05]And then tonight we still have the Ulti Duo tournament, which is going to play out similarly to the MGE tournament.
[04:57.96]I'm not sure who's playing in that.
[04:59.62]I'm guessing it'll be another nice lineup of people.
[05:02.71]And then 9 o'clock is going to be the randomizer pub.
[05:05.23]I'm going to dust off my mouse and keyboard and I'm going to show these kids how to game
[05:13.40]It's going down.
[05:16.37]Keep telling yourself that, buddy.
[05:17.37]These kids are going to wreck you, man.
[05:18.69]I know they are.
[05:19.19]They're so good.
[05:22.22]Oh, God.
[05:26.14]That's fine.
[05:26.90]We have a $251 donation from Insanity.
[05:30.73]I don't know if I can read this, but I'm going to.
[05:35.73]From the admins and mods of Fuck Yeah TF2!
[05:40.15]Here's to completely destroying last year's raised amount of DOSH.
[05:45.14]I think you meant dough?
[05:46.44]DOSH, no, DOSH.
[05:48.24]DOSH, that's European slang, man.
[05:49.84]Come on.
[05:51.16]That's what an English gent would say.
[05:52.76]DOSH!
[05:54.40]That's a lot of DOSH.
[05:55.59]I'll take that back, I'll be an idiot.
[05:56.97]Thank you so much, and shout out to Fuck Yeah TF2!
[06:01.22]and I'll never swear again.
[06:01.92]What was that one again?
[06:02.93]I'm done.
[06:03.53]Hey, we have, uh, who was our number one donator from last year?
[06:08.12]Uh, Shit Wizard?
[06:11.50]No shame, no shame.
[06:15.29]Has he been back again?
[06:16.13]I haven't been following the donations.
[06:17.97]Has the Fecal Wizard made a reappearance?
[06:20.46]What do you mean the Fecal Conjurer?
[06:25.66]It's just everywhere.
[06:26.96]What does dosh mean?
[06:28.54]I'm in an urban dictionary, I don't know.
[06:30.23]It means money!
[06:30.69]It's like... Moolah!
[06:33.67]Cash-a-roonies!
[06:35.74]It's also a multi-instrumentalist who has songs.
[06:40.06]He's from Minneapolis!
[06:43.49]Oh, it's the name of an artist?
[06:45.89]Yeah, a contemporary slang term used for amount of money.
[06:49.64]hey man you want to catch that new movie?
[06:51.44]nah I'm out of dosh snap I got in the server after many many retries we are approaching thirty four thousand dollars very quickly it seems like we just crossed thirty three uh... we should do something special when we hit thirty six that would be the total from last year uh... I thought
[07:15.91]Star was going to sing Wrecking Ball, or was that a dream?
[07:19.80]That's still up for grabs.
[07:21.46]That's not today.
[07:22.48]Isn't Jerma going to get like 500 bucks or something for it?
[07:26.47]If by the end of the charity stream, if Star sings the chorus of Wrecking Ball, it's got to be the whole thing.
[07:35.38]It's got to be like he's never sung anything as unbelievable in his life.
[07:40.58]I'm going to donate 500 bucks.
[07:43.09]500 bucks.
[07:45.36]I feel like I need to find someone who will, like, counter-bid you and donate 500 if I don't do it.
[07:51.69]But, like, that's my only hope right now.
[07:54.57]Yeah, I don't know if that's gonna happen, buddy.
[07:57.46]We have a $100 donation from NeoNemonical22.
[08:01.86]Well, here we go again.
[08:02.86]Guess I don't need groceries this week.
[08:04.59]Good thing I've already got some.
[08:05.85]Always good to see Star and Jerma.
[08:07.77]Y'all bring a smile to my face.
[08:09.23]Keep up the good work.
[08:10.23]Tip of the hat.
[08:11.14]Thank you very much.
[08:12.38]We appreciate it so much.
[08:13.50]Hopefully you don't starve.
[08:15.80]don't don't do that unless you're playing the game or you're admirable and well even if you're playing the game you don't want to start yellow well even if you are playing the game then you don't want to do that that's the name of the game what's the tip of the house last year marble where you sold your soul for Twitter followers yeah I was actually like genuinely had no money I guess I was it was really liberating I say I'm not even gonna lie I woke up the next day and I was like wow that was cool crushed totally fucking stupid but cool crushed
[08:45.86]Donations are just flying in.
[08:46.98]We've just passed $34,000, I want to say.
[08:49.80]I can't even read the total number because we're just flying with donations upon donations.
[08:54.61]Thank you so much, guys.
[08:55.43]I'll try to read as much as I can.
[08:58.27]But there are a lot of them.
[09:07.46]I've just found a Starcam.
[09:08.95]I'm watching him roll out the middle.
[09:10.58]Oh, we're going to get to mid.
[09:11.84]We're going past the door.
[09:13.20]We're going through the other door.
[09:14.97]We're going up here.
[09:15.81]We're going to... Miss that.
[09:18.19]Damn.
[09:18.91]That would have been fun.
[09:20.37]And I get hit by it.
[09:21.78]Never mind.
[09:22.20]Not fun.
[09:23.08]Was killed by percent killer name.
[09:25.80]Get owned.
[09:27.85]$5.01 donation from Fireball411.
[09:30.61]Keep up the amazing work, you guys.
[09:33.15]Loving the stream.
[09:34.40]Thank you.
[09:35.99]$5 donation from GZ.
[09:38.24]Thanks for all the streams, truck truck.
[09:40.94]I concur, truck truck, doing the camera work and providing house and home for Lang and Mabla to also live and eat, presumably.
[09:52.41]My question for the boys back in upstate New York is how many pizzas have been eaten?
[09:57.90]Has the papa been called?
[09:59.58]Maybe that's what was on fire.
[10:02.27]Yeah, what was that?
[10:03.97]Still wondering about that a little bit, gotta be honest.
[10:06.19]Did you guys burn a cake or something?
[10:07.39]There was some cooking going on.
[10:09.10]It got real.
[10:10.80]That was the best.
[10:11.36]It's like, Lang chimes in to tell us something, and you're like, wah, wah, wah, in the background.
[10:16.97]The second fire alarm pulled.
[10:20.21]I like that the priority with Lang was to come here and tell us everything was on fire, and not go take care of it.
[10:28.10]The tip of the hat says, it's my baby, Steven.
[10:32.12]Harold.
[10:33.78]I feel like you've been dropping the ball on that lately.
[10:36.40]If I don't know, how can they?
[10:40.39]So just out of curiosity, do you guys remember, or do you have a statistic somewhere from last year of how much was donated at this time?
[10:49.56]Just because we're about to pass the $35,000.
[10:53.99]We do not, unfortunately.
[10:56.09]But...
[10:59.84]Yeah, like 15 bucks.
[11:02.23]Maybe something.
[11:03.23]Kurt believes it was around 15,000 at this point, so we are very much ahead of that.
[11:09.09]We're on a much better pace this time.
[11:11.60]Yeah, so Star's donated more himself than we had this time last year.
[11:16.12]Well, you see, I won lots of things, so I had to get a lot of money.
[11:19.37]Star, if you win this round in the pub, you gotta donate another one of those.
[11:24.11]Star, for every single kill you get with that rocket launcher, you have to donate 50 bucks.
[11:29.30]Uh...
[11:30.27]I'm switching classes.
[11:34.01]Hi.
[11:35.13]Mela-kun.
[11:36.80]You still over at the tip of the hat's establishment?
[11:42.46]I just touched Ling.
[11:43.84]Right now.
[11:44.20]He's touching me!
[11:45.31]I need an adult!
[11:48.65]Mela, I'm impressed at how well you played, not in your home setup.
[11:53.11]You must have got comfy over there.
[11:56.18]It's better than my own setup.
[11:57.62]This desk has so much space, I'm not used to it.
[12:00.09]Yeah, me and Mela are like jammed right next to each other in like an oak study with nice green paint looking out into the plains of Buffalo.
[12:09.40]It's beautiful.
[12:10.88]This is Mela having his corner.
[12:15.83]Who was coaching Mela during the MGE?
[12:17.85]I mean, I was here... Neck massage?
[12:20.08]Neck massage?
[12:20.70]You know, lying?
[12:21.88]Yes, there was a lot of that, I'm not gonna lie.
[12:25.74]Tell me a little bit more about that awesome hat.
[12:46.23]I don't know how hats are made, but you go ahead.
[12:53.48]I can talk about the hat.
[12:55.66]I will talk about the hat.
[12:59.63]Ruskidoo of Crit's Cast fame and also modeler of several of the items that you know and love in this video game.
[13:05.52]Team Fortress is the second.
[13:07.34]Ruskidoo has made our iconic boulder hat logo into a wearable in-game hat.
[13:13.15]But in order for us to get it in the game, you have to go on the Steam Workshop.
[13:18.22]and uh, vote it up, you gotta rate it up, you gotta vote it up, you gotta comment on it saying this is great, uh, Volvo please, or Riot, don't say that.
[13:26.45]Um, so uh, yeah.
[13:29.36]God!
[13:31.42]Um.
[13:32.54]I feel like you're also gonna, you're gonna be like the next host for The Price is Right, like that was so good.
[13:37.39]Thank you.
[13:37.95]You were like describing the prices at the end.
[13:40.37]We have a beautiful hat here.
[13:42.37]Seriously, it felt like I was in a shopping channel or something right there for a second, man.
[13:49.25]Anyway, I linked it in chat.
[13:50.94]I am the tip of the hat to count apparently.
[13:52.58]I forgot who I'm signed in as.
[13:54.16]Go click that.
[13:54.72]Go rate our hat.
[13:56.35]It already has a five-star rating with 3,727 ratings on it.
[14:02.62]So this thing is skyrocketing to the top of the workshop.
[14:05.76]It's already plastered at the number one spot for this week.
[14:08.75]So yeah, go there and make sure you let Valve know that we want this in the game.
[14:11.93]And of course...
[14:13.72]Fake hair everywhere.
[14:15.52]Fake hair everywhere.
[14:16.78]I knew you were going to do that.
[14:18.81]All the proceeds that we receive from the sales of this hat will go directly to One Step Camp.
[14:23.53]Keep in mind, though, that Valve does still get their cut and transaction fees are still applied.
[14:29.32]So 100% of the proceeds will not go to One Step Camp.
[14:33.46]Only the portion that we get goes to One Step Camp, which I believe to be about 25% of the sale.
[14:39.79]I have a $500 donation from Sparda119.
[14:49.11]Just keep the vids running!
[14:51.54]And you must all do a rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen altogether.
[14:57.18]Well, buddy, you know... That's a long one.
[14:59.57]Yeah, that's seven minutes, and you already gave us money!
[15:01.93]$500.
[15:02.77]Thank you so much, buddy.
[15:04.83]Alright, well, we might as well just at least do a piece of it.
[15:08.87]We have to.
[15:09.72]I don't know the actual words.
[15:13.70]I just know, like, the tone.
[15:14.88]Okay, that's not good.
[15:17.18]So thank you for the $500.
[15:18.92]If, Jermall, you want to, I mean, you know...
[15:22.18]Sing it for him.
[15:33.05]I don't know the words either.
[15:39.90]Hey, why are you the one singing the Miley Cyrus thing?
[15:50.09]Like, this is your jam.
[15:52.06]Like, singing dumb things.
[15:54.44]Not that the song's dumb, it's just that your rendition is...
[15:58.68]Okay, it was pretty good.
[15:59.85]So on top of all that, if that isn't enough excitement for you right there, which, let's be honest, it probably should be, if you donate within the next 36 minutes...
[16:09.21]you will be automatically entered into a raffle to have a chance to win either a Strange Kritzkrieg or an Australian Blutsauger.
[16:17.41]So go ahead and get those donations in.
[16:18.79]Any donation, any amount, within the next 36 minutes makes you automatically eligible for those prizes.
[16:24.28]You can even be eligible if you enter in for other raffles.
[16:27.12]This is like a bonus on top of everything.
[16:29.34]So go ahead, get donating right now, and these fabulous prizes could be yours, Seabear.
[16:36.08]Thank you, Mike.
[16:37.64]And a brand new car!
[16:39.84]And a brand new car!
[16:41.38]We get to step on the right tiles.
[16:43.33]Well, have you come down to a contestant's row and bid a bet on your prizes?
[16:47.71]No.
[16:48.45]I have a $111.11 donation from Monty.
[16:53.28]Keep up the good work.
[16:54.34]I'm proud of you, Dad.
[16:57.42]Maybe that's mini-wheat?
[16:59.70]Uh, $50 donation from no name given, just the guy's name, about to say thank you Andrew for $50.
[17:11.04]Wow, there's three Quick-Fix medics bearing their way down onto Red Last right now.
[17:16.83]Brief correction about the timed raffle, you must donate at least $5 to be eligible for it.
[17:21.13]So any donation over $5 makes you eligible for the timed raffle.
[17:26.84]And we did pass 35k while people were singing.
[17:31.34]And we are very close to 36k.
[17:33.15]So if there's someone, an idea somebody has for something we can do for the stream maybe when it hit last year's total, which is coming up, I'd say in the next five minutes or so.
[17:43.66]I don't know.
[17:44.18]I'm open ears.
[17:44.78]I like to... I think we're just going to raise our dongers.
[17:47.84]Are we going to raise our dongers?
[17:49.30]A traditional twitch.tv.
[17:53.15]You might have raised it a little too early there, Sean, but by now my Twitch chat...
[18:00.94]I have no other ideas.
[18:01.96]I'm very uncreative.
[18:03.20]Can we show that picture that I linked you at some point too?
[18:06.73]Because that's pretty cool.
[18:09.85]The one-step camp, the mala picture.
[18:16.48]25 donation from TheLustyArgonianMaid.
[18:19.84]He wants to say, Star, I want to hear you sing.
[18:24.99]Oh, God.
[18:26.65]He's got an awesome name, so...
[18:31.32]I wish we had incentives or something, like a thing that we could fill up for you to sing.
[18:37.65]A thing I could fill up for me to sing.
[18:41.16]That's creative.
[18:42.46]I have $50 from Wolf Machina.
[18:46.20]Second $50 for the cause.
[18:48.30]The Mela Airshots and MGE were insane.
[18:50.83]Teach me, Master of the Air.
[18:53.59]Shameless self-promotion.
[18:55.35]twitch.tv/Wolf Machina.
[18:57.17]Enjoying the stream immensely.
[18:58.57]And a great cause to support.
[18:59.74]Thank you, Wolf Machina.
[19:02.44]He is the Master of the Air.
[19:05.96]He was born in it.
[19:08.07]You're gonna get like a new title, name, or something about you every tip of the hat.
[19:12.56]It's so good.
[19:13.10]Master of the Air.
[19:15.59]And Bob-Wob.
[19:16.45]Bob-Wob, Master of the Air.
[19:18.25]You're like a Dark Souls boss.
[19:22.56]Alert.
[19:22.70]The control point has been contested.
[19:33.91]I have a $5 donation from space turtle, from outer turtle.
[19:39.15]For love.
[19:41.48]Love, tip of the hat.
[19:42.48]It's freaking awesome.
[19:43.34]Keep it up.
[19:43.78]P.S.
[19:43.94]Stand tall for turtle fall.
[19:45.88]Nice.
[19:49.51]I like it.
[19:50.37]I'm so surprised that's a thing.
[19:52.91]Of all the things.
[19:55.02]That's so good, though.
[19:57.60]You gotta stand tall for turtle crawl.
[20:00.50]turtle fall.
[20:01.26]It's any variation of that.
[20:02.80]It doesn't even matter.
[20:04.03]Any variation.
[20:05.05]We are getting a lot of $5 in for that, um, Critskrig and Australian whatever thing.
[20:10.43]I'm not even going to pretend like I know what it is, but, um, keep them coming.
[20:13.54]I got one $5 donation from Bearhawkman, who claims to be Star's slut.
[20:20.96]I don't know if that's true or not.
[20:22.45]What?
[20:22.83]But you can be worse.
[20:24.93]I can confirm.
[20:28.75]There you go.
[20:29.81]Lucky guy.
[20:32.65]OH!
[20:34.54]What is that number I see before me on Twitch chat?
[20:38.39]36K.
[20:38.95]Somebody must have made a big donation.
[20:42.83]So yeah, we have officially hit $36,000 raised for One Step Camp, which means we have broken our record set last year.
[20:52.57]We have officially surpassed the amount of money we raised for last year's Tip of the Hats, and we're not even done with day one yet.
[20:58.78]So that is a huge accomplishment, guys.
[21:00.84]Everyone give yourselves a little clapper.
[21:03.45]A few times I've been around that track, so it's not just gonna happen like that.
[21:10.75]Cause I ain't no holoback, bro.
[21:12.49]I ain't no holoback, bro.
[21:18.63]Awesome.
[21:19.25]That's great.
[21:19.98]Awesome.
[21:21.02]Nice job, guys.
[21:22.18]50k is the next big goal.
[21:24.22]If we get that tonight, we'll be pretty happy.
[21:26.50]Let's try to hit 50,000 by the end of tonight, guys.
[21:28.73]I think we can do it for sure.
[21:30.39]I think so, too.
[21:31.01]We got $100 from Nevernoit.
[21:34.47]Here's some Australian cash.
[21:36.54]Also, Jerma and Star should do a duet.
[21:41.23]And Waldemar the Filthy Immigrant donates $25.
[21:45.33]Dude, how much do I have to donate to get a shout-out?
[21:48.24]Well, that's how much!
[21:49.24]$25!
[21:49.68]I'm just randomly kind of picking the ones that I fancy.
[21:54.81]There's a lot of them that I'm overlooking, and I apologize for that.
[21:59.10]Thank you, everybody who's donated.
[22:01.06]I'm trying to read as many as I can.
[22:03.34]And if you have a nice short comment that you want to leave, I will do my best to read them.
[22:07.50]Many of you are favoring just to donate with no comment, and that's also great and fine.
[22:14.87]So how about that duet?
[22:16.90]I have all the lyrics, apparently, to Bohemian Rhapsody, someone used as their comment, if you need them.
[22:23.99]Let's do a nice Christmas song, what do you think?
[22:31.85]The crits.
[22:33.34]Christmas song right now?
[22:34.50]What's with the singing?
[22:35.90]Last year it was like a whole new world, Aladdin, whatever, with the people that did it.
[22:40.36]I don't even remember.
[22:41.21]I think it was Admiral and someone.
[22:42.99]It was.
[22:43.49]It wasn't me.
[22:44.49]Yeah, definitely.
[22:48.53]What's always with the singing and charity?
[22:52.46]Why are you such a Grinch, man?
[22:54.42]You know?
[22:55.04]Yeah, definitely.
[22:58.38]I was raised on coal.
[23:01.43]Coal as in the TF2 player was awful.
[23:06.51]Roasted!
[23:08.28]Thank you, I was waiting for the roasted.
[23:12.28]Speaking of roasted... Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.
[23:19.13]A frog nipping at your nose.
[23:23.44]Yuletide caroling.
[23:28.45]Who's idea was this?
[23:29.67]A $500 donation.
[23:30.93]Unless we're talking about the one from earlier, guys.
[23:35.40]I do have a $100 donation from CPK Gagalor.
[23:41.91]I also tried donating unusuals, but I got an error.
[23:44.27]Now I can't trade for seven days.
[23:46.45]Roasted!
[23:48.08]So instead I give you actual money.
[23:49.60]Keep up the good work.
[23:50.26]Thank you!
[23:51.04]And sorry for busting up your trading thing.
[23:55.94]Uh, $75 donation from L2309, who says, my one simple request is as follows, and then there's no request.
[24:06.62]Are you gonna donate more with your request?
[24:10.48]That's the prelude.
[24:11.49]That's the prelude, though.
[24:16.58]I don't see it, so hopefully, you know, something there.
[24:21.47]$62 donation from Wishy Washy.
[24:24.58]Love you guys.
[24:25.22]Stream is awesome.
[24:26.04]Keep up the good work.
[24:26.84]Smiley face.
[24:27.88]Thank you.
[24:36.56]I'm still trying to get in the server.
[24:41.18]$20 donation from Blue.
[24:42.83]36k, easy game.
[24:47.65]Easy life.
[24:49.54]I agree.
[24:50.02]Thank you, Blue.
[24:53.73]Somebody shoot me the server info again, just because I feel like I'm going to the wrong place.
[24:59.54]I think it's just a lot of people trying to get in.
[25:03.26]Yeah, probably.
[25:05.32]Yeah, this is the place to be right now.
[25:09.65]If you like TF2 and you want to play it,
[25:13.38]and you're not in here.
[25:14.70]Whoa.
[25:15.16]Somebody is actually in spectator on the server.
[25:17.61]I can see them from STV.
[25:18.67]I'm not gonna use cyber potatoes.
[25:20.47]What are you doing?
[25:21.67]You thought potatoes could hide from Adderable?
[25:24.07]No, it's a cyber potato.
[25:25.39]It cannot escape purview.
[25:31.44]What was that?
[25:33.10]What was that?
[25:34.04]I'm snuffling for potatoes here, man.
[25:35.96]Have you never met Adderable?
[25:39.47]Snuffling on these nuts.
[25:42.11]Oh.
[25:45.04]You need to kick that guy.
[25:54.67]He needs to go.
[25:56.52]He needs to go.
[25:58.62]I mean, I've snuffled before, but not for potatoes.
[26:01.96]That's outrageous.
[26:04.47]$25 from Mikro has a question for you, Jerma.
[26:07.99]How did you come up with the Grandpa character?
[26:12.82]Ah, I've... My grandmother, it's not even actually my grandfather, it's my grandmother.
[26:19.54]And she used to live in the house with us back when I was younger.
[26:22.61]And my grandmother used to have all kinds of people come over on Sunday to play bridge.
[26:28.45]Like all, a bunch, a ton of old people.
[26:30.03]Like we were talking like all the crabbiest old people you could ever imagine would come over my house and sit around in a circle and play bridge for like four hours.
[26:38.77]And they would just all be, you know, get out of here, that's the two of hearts, that doesn't even work.
[26:43.07]You shut up, you idiot, that's a queen.
[26:45.02]Like, they would just yell at each other the whole night.
[26:47.42]Right.
[26:47.56]And I would just be sitting there just absorbing all these mannerisms, and that's, like, kind of how it happened.
[26:52.49]Asked and answered.
[26:53.87]That was, like, the best answer to any question today, so congratulations.
[27:00.44]I don't know, man.
[27:01.54]Football's a pretty great answer.
[27:02.74]Yeah, besides football.
[27:06.32]I love that kid.
[27:07.18]That kid is amazing.
[27:08.63]Yeah.
[27:09.65]I have $50 from The Golden Shower.
[27:13.98]Request.
[27:15.04]Heavy hoovy boxing fight.
[27:17.60]Well, the only person I know that can satisfy that request is streaming right now, so.
[27:22.83]He's a little boobie bopper, but he's on the camera.
[27:28.28]Maybe Lang can take over and Kurt can get it in.
[27:31.08]It'd still be the same computer on the camera.
[27:33.75]That's true.
[27:35.45]Well, like, isn't Maela's computer there?
[27:38.12]There's many options.
[27:39.26]I guess we could have Kurt sit at the Maela station and do some boopy bopping, but the computer I'm on currently cannot do that.
[27:46.33]Kurt says he'll do it later tonight.
[27:48.51]I heard him.
[27:49.09]Oh, no.
[27:49.27]But the stream didn't.
[27:51.97]I heard him!
[27:56.16]I heard him!
[27:58.05]Hello?
[27:59.25]I have a $100 donation from Boon.
[28:02.77]Keep up the good work.
[28:03.94]Thank you, Boon.
[28:05.54]Another $100 donation from Dr. Atlas.
[28:09.74]Fantastic job with the event, guys.
[28:11.16]Great to see so many TF2 players banding together for a good cause.
[28:15.01]Thank you, Dr. Atlas.
[28:16.11]We appreciate it, buddy.
[28:21.49]And I'm getting some requests via donation from Griever and others that want to hear Jerma the Jukebox do some beatboxing.
[28:29.24]And I kind of want to hear it too, so I don't know, put you on the spot.
[28:33.29]Maybe Grandpa can do a little beatboxing over there?
[28:35.62]Grandpa beatboxing would be like an old song.
[28:40.28]Probably the ABCs.
[28:42.47]Got that ready?
[28:44.17]You want to tell the ABC story while I get started?
[28:47.09]Because you love this for some reason.
[28:49.20]I don't know why.
[28:50.80]Jerma had an idea for a video one time.
[28:53.56]He just said one line to himself that he thought was wicked funny.
[28:57.03]That's also a Jerma line.
[28:58.31]Wicked funny.
[29:01.14]What is the line?
[29:03.12]I forget exactly.
[29:04.02]Well, first you have to explain what I was even attempting.
[29:07.22]No, I want the line first.
[29:08.50]That's important, semester.
[29:09.93]A, B, C, D, E, F, G. You ain't no friend of me.
[29:13.99]Okay, and that was it.
[29:14.99]That was all you had, and you thought that was hilarious.
[29:17.92]And you wrote yourself a whole song around that one line about the ABCs going through every single letter in the alphabet, down to the end, down to Z, based off of A, B, C, D, E, F, G. You ain't no friend of me.
[29:31.55]You completed this entire thing, and you just came into Mumble and told me, this is awful.
[29:37.82]I don't want to do this.
[29:40.66]I tried to warn you.
[29:42.69]It was going to be like Grandpa was going to teach a bunch of kids in school the ABCs.
[29:46.69]He was like a substitute, and I was going to try to get it animated.
[29:49.42]I forgot all those details.
[29:51.32]I just remember that you made a very poor life choice.
[29:56.75]Because I thought about how much work was going to go into, like, I would have to get, like, somebody that knew how to play the horn.
[30:04.60]I don't know anybody that knows how to play the horn.
[30:07.45]Like, I had this whole orchestra in my head, and I was like, how the hell am I going to do that?
[30:13.70]So it was scrapped, and there was a lot of things that I had to do.
[30:17.91]Guys, come on.
[30:18.71]Are we getting the beatboxing door or what?
[30:21.27]Yeah, yeah, hold on.
[30:22.21]I'll get it going, I'll get it going.
[30:24.22]I gotta have my mic, like, open, though.
[30:26.08]Because I have to, like, I can't, like, hold my push to talk and still.
[30:28.94]Hold on.
[30:29.20]Oh, you have to turn it on, actually.
[30:36.01]So, what you want me to do?
[30:37.01]Is this the TF2 song, or what?
[30:39.02]What song am I doing?
[30:39.88]I thought it was beatboxing.
[30:40.78]I didn't know it was, like, freestyle rap.
[30:42.16]I'm excited.
[30:42.74]Oh, no, no, no.
[30:43.50]It's just beatboxing.
[30:44.26]Well, I don't know.
[30:45.89]Yeah, sure.
[30:48.57]I think something good.
[30:50.65]Okay.
[30:51.63]You let me know when you're ready.
[30:52.41]I can keep reading more of these donations if you want.
[30:54.22]I'll come up with some, like, awesome ABC lyrics.
[30:57.56]I have a $10 donation from Seth, who goes by the alias, Shit, the ground is shaking.
[31:03.03]And his comment is, Shit, the ground is shaking.
[31:06.83]5,000 times in the comments.
[31:10.94]Thank you, Seth.
[31:11.28]Alright, let's get this.
[31:11.98]Let's move this mic over here.
[31:17.73]Let's think.
[31:18.95]How does it start?
[31:20.01]Oh my god, see, he's doing it again.
[31:22.00]Getting nervous, huh?
[31:23.60]Just gotta go for it, man.
[31:24.48]You gotta shake the cobwebs off.
[31:28.15]Do I... do I... do Market Garden kills still count?
[31:31.51]We still counting them?
[31:34.94]Mmm... how many do you have?
[31:36.56]40,000.
[31:37.06]Fuck.
[31:38.74]God.
[31:38.84]I don't actually... I haven't been keeping count.
[31:40.44]Summer car.
[31:42.59]Alright, the ground is shaking.
[31:43.43]Here we go.
[31:43.83]Start again.
[31:44.43]Get that beat.
[31:44.97]Rock it.
[31:51.60]A B C No What does the E F G come?
[32:08.16]E F G Did we skip D?
[32:14.53]H I J Ain't no friend to me
[32:21.53]Ain't no friend of me!
[32:25.28]Ain't no friend of me!
[32:31.04]X, Y, Z!
[32:33.35]There's like four minutes in between!
[32:38.57]That's what I say!
[32:41.39]A, B, C, D, E, F, G!
[32:47.76]Beautiful!
[32:49.00]Oh my goodness!
[32:49.34]Thank you for that!
[32:51.42]That was awesome.
[32:58.64]I thought that was a good trailer.
[32:59.38]Roasted!
[33:00.18]Dude, the ABC song would have been pretty good, right?
[33:02.91]You get a good song and you learn something.
[33:08.45]Let me jump in there and remind everyone that if you donate a minimum of $5 during this hour, that means you've got less than 20 minutes left to be entered in to win a Strange Crit's Krieg, an Australian Blutziger.
[33:23.28]You have to donate.
[33:24.46]before 6 EDT, so you've got less than 20 minutes left.
[33:29.73]Any donation you make, you can still enter the other raffles, but you have to donate at least five bucks.
[33:34.32]Really want to pump this one.
[33:35.74]I really need Lang in right now to do his excellent salesman voice, but you'll have to sit up with this Irish guy for now.
[33:42.26]So get donating, please!
[33:44.31]Getting close to 40,000.
[33:46.47]We are over 38, so 38.348k.
[33:49.11]Heading towards 39, 40.
[33:54.04]Crazy.
[33:55.81]Didn't we just pass 35?
[33:56.87]You guys are unbelievable.
[34:00.44]There's a lot of $5 that have come in for this thing.
[34:02.80]They're dropping fives all over them.
[34:04.40]They're dropping fives all over you.
[34:07.85]Man, Jerma's been really carrying this segment.
[34:09.97]His creative juices have been flowing, man.
[34:11.66]This guy, sign him up.
[34:13.10]He needs a record deal right now.
[34:20.17]I won the MGE.
[34:22.52]You're a great two-star, I swear.
[34:26.61]$10 from Kaboomsicle.
[34:29.40]I love all that you guys are doing.
[34:31.36]I was looking forward to Tip of the Hats for many weeks, and I'm not disappointed in the slightest, especially Air Senpai, Mela, and Golden Boy's duo, Jerma and Star.
[34:41.80]Air Senpai.
[34:42.66]Air Senpai!
[34:48.87]$20 from SomeWittyComment.
[34:51.70]Big fan here.
[34:52.65]Star, whatever happened to story time?
[34:54.93]I love listening to you tell stories casually.
[34:57.01]Also, are you still drawing?
[34:59.54]God damn.
[35:01.58]I did a Reddit AMA today that actually was, like, the top, like, top of the question.
[35:06.77]Oh, my God.
[35:07.31]I just got, like, triple air shot with arrows.
[35:09.85]Like, three arrows in my body.
[35:12.22]I think it's on speed, too.
[35:14.34]It's a long answer, so...
[35:16.85]I would direct yourself towards that.
[35:19.01]It's something I want to do, it just hasn't happened.
[35:23.38]Storytime is dark.
[35:24.36]Damn.
[35:26.20]I don't draw much anymore either.
[35:27.55]It's just very sad, depressing stories of not drawing and...
[35:34.55]And not singing.
[35:35.81]I don't do anything anymore.
[35:38.08]I think you're going to be singing by the end of this weekend.
[35:40.72]Just throwing it out there.
[35:43.24]25 from Man in a Mask.
[35:45.51]Great event, guys.
[35:46.17]Here's to 50,000.
[35:47.91]Thank you.
[35:51.76]Question, I guess, for everybody.
[35:52.88]$15 donation from Twillet.
[35:55.38]Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?
[36:02.63]I feel like...
[36:04.82]the only answers no I would not roast I thought about it
[36:14.59]I would fight the giant horse-sized duck because I would feel like I'd be able to befriend the beast.
[36:21.52]Sue that with the ABC song.
[36:23.43]I see.
[36:23.93]The dots are connecting.
[36:25.99]I mean, it's just like a... It's a duck.
[36:28.25]You know, you could befriend a duck pretty easily.
[36:30.43]And all ducks need to learn their ABCs.
[36:32.12]Yeah, no, we're on the same page, Jerma.
[36:33.94]Yeah, someone was asking me earlier today the same question, but replaced with, like, a... Jerma-sized ducks.
[36:39.65]Like, a hundred Jerma-sized ducks or one horse-sized Jerma.
[36:43.97]That would be a...
[36:44.31]A horse-sized Gerber would just be like... would just be stupid.
[36:51.63]Would just be me with like two extra legs and a longer torso.
[36:58.15]So, really quick, just want to remind you guys where to find us if you want more of this hot horse-sized Jerma action.
[37:05.96]You can go over to our website, that is tipofthehats.org.

[51:10.23]No sirens this time.
[51:11.69]It's a stealth, stealth warning.
[51:16.12]I didn't see it coming.
[51:17.20]Do you want to do like a countdown from 10 or something?
[51:21.75]From Marvel?
[51:22.77]I will.
[51:25.03]Do your stopwatch out.
[51:27.43]I'm looking at my Steam Community clock here.
[51:30.45]It's 20 seconds to go, but I can't count that high.
[51:32.66]We'll wait.
[51:41.06]Are you ready?
[51:42.64]5... 4... 3... A... B... C... It's closed.
[51:54.48]That's it, we're done.
[51:55.16]Ain't no friend of me.
[51:56.65]Alright, good luck everybody.
[52:00.53]Are they all going to one person, or is it two separate?
[52:03.94]I think it's all for one, it's just one prize.
[52:06.34]I have a question as well.
[52:11.21]Yeah?
[52:12.81]What if you were to donate more than five dollars, you count to multiple times?
[52:17.74]Uh, no.
[52:18.42]For the regular raffles, you absolutely are.
[52:21.31]The more you donate, the higher chance you have of winning.
[52:23.98]For the timed raffles, it's as long as you beat the minimum, you get one entry.
[52:31.83]Dude, that sounded like you just fell off a building.
[52:38.08]I'm gonna make it.
[52:39.06]That was very sudden as well.
[52:41.40]No warning.
[52:41.98]I don't know what happened there.
[52:44.19]But yeah, for the timed raffles, donating $20 makes you just as likely to win as donating $5.
[52:49.87]For the other raffles, donating $20 makes you more likely to win as compared to $5, so...
[52:56.35]So what you should do is donate $5 a lot of times.
[52:59.53]When will we know the winner, Mr. Lange?
[53:02.99]I'm sorry, what was that, Bear?
[53:03.75]When will we know the winner?
[53:04.64]Is that soon, or is that at the end, too?
[53:06.22]I'm going to talk to my boy Whiskerbiscuit, try to find that out, and I will get back to you.
[53:09.78]Okay.
[53:12.25]Alright, so good luck, everybody.
[53:13.23]Hope you guys win.
[53:14.71]Keep the donations coming, though.
[53:15.83]We have a lot of prizes, a million, bazillion prizes at the end of tomorrow's session.
[53:21.36]Wherein the guy who donated $1,500 will win all of them.

[53:37.93]Says, Star and Jerma are dirty gym socks.
[53:42.43]I try not to be, but... It's not a good thing to be.

[53:52.64]$5.55 from Jared Hodge.
