[01:50.00]Late?
[01:50.30]No, you can't be late on an off-schedule stream.
[01:52.48]We already talked about this.
[01:56.40]If it's an off-schedule stream, it's just gonna happen whenever.
[02:00.54]If it's an on-schedule stream, it's gonna happen whenever.
[02:04.29]It's gonna happen whenever it happens.
[02:07.85]Did I cry when Italics left?
[02:09.41]Yeah, Italics is no longer here.
[02:11.98]He's gone.
[02:13.54]The purpose of... The purpose of, like, not streaming on Thursday and Friday was because... I wanted to spend a little time with him.
[02:21.58]There was some things we wanted to do.
[02:22.84]We wanted to hang out.
[02:24.77]And he was only going to be here till... Then.
[02:28.99]So... He's back.
[02:31.41]I believe he's home safely now.
[02:33.71]I think.
[02:35.99]Let's see.
[02:36.89]Let's see what his last text message was.
[02:41.86]His last texts were Made it to the airport That's it so he made it he's there Anyways, we're gonna play that climb in the mountain with a hammer game everybody that everybody played like four weeks ago and

[03:19.11]That's what we're playing.
[03:21.95]Reading DMs on streams.
[03:23.35]Yeah, I told you.
[03:24.21]This game was... No, the reason why I didn't play this game like two weeks ago was because it wasn't on Steam.
[03:29.78]It was only on like the Humble Bundle Store, right?
[03:35.65]Get out of town.
[03:36.21]Yeah, whatever this game is.
[03:41.33]I'm not gonna get angry at this game.
[03:44.59]Today's Sunday.
[03:46.30]It's a Sunday stream.
[03:47.60]We're just gonna relax.
[03:49.78]We're gonna chill.
[03:50.70]And I know it's supposed to be really impossible and hard and only like seven people have beat this game.
[03:56.08]I understand that.
[03:59.07]I don't know if I'm gonna be one of those seven.
[04:05.68]but you know anyways before we start thank you to uh thank you to thank you knock for the one dollar hey hi
[04:17.95]Thank you Lenzy6 for the 10 bucks.
[04:19.91]Is this a motherfucking Jerma reference?
[04:21.77]What is this?
[04:22.11]What is it?
[04:23.57]This, yes it is.
[04:25.67]This is a Jerma stream.
[04:27.13]My name is Jeremy.
[04:28.75]My nickname is Jerma.
[04:30.59]This stream is gonna have lots of references to me because it's my stream.
[04:33.97]It's here we are.
[04:34.57]I'm gonna make, I'm gonna say something.
[04:36.75]And then you can reference it later.
[04:37.95]For instance.
[04:39.90]Uh, let's give you a reference for later.
[04:45.33]I got it.
[04:47.17]Hey.
[04:48.99]Red ink?
[04:49.75]Doesn't it bother you when people use red ink?
[04:53.65]It sucks.
[04:54.03]I hate that.
[04:55.55]Red ink should only be used for correcting papers.
[04:59.49]Right?
[05:00.71]You ever have a letter written to you in red ink?
[05:02.61]I have.
[05:03.63]If anybody, like, fucking grab a pen and write something down in red ink and give it to you, it's like, get that fucking red ink out of here.
[05:09.55]And you know, I feel the same way.
[05:10.53]I feel the same way about blue ink.
[05:13.15]Blue ink...
[05:14.47]Blue ink is like the shitty in-between between red ink and black ink.
[05:18.73]Use black ink.
[05:19.31]You know what the blue ink is for?
[05:24.96]Children.
[05:25.80]You know what I mean?
[05:26.22]Like a child.
[05:27.84]Painting.
[05:30.58]Red ink.
[05:31.86]Yeah, make that reference to me later when I fucking go over the... There's like a giant pen in this game, isn't it?
[05:36.20]You like go over it.
[05:40.46]What's right?
[05:40.84]No, blue ink is stupid.
[05:43.27]No green ink.
[05:44.33]And don't, don't even, don't even, don't even, nobody coming at me in this stream right now with your bullshit, like, quadruple ink pens.
[05:51.74]No, no, that doesn't even know what it wants to be.
[05:54.42]You got, like, the green ink slider, and then, you know, the red ink slider.
[05:58.36]Nope, just straight up black ink.
[06:00.16]Give me, like, give me a nice, nice, like, $200 black pen, black ink that you gotta get refills for.

[07:39.97]Well, greetings from America.
[07:42.39]Hopefully you're welcome here.
[07:44.59]Everyone, everybody is welcome here.

[07:48.90]I care that you're having a good time.
[07:50.38]I hope your community treats you well.
[07:53.76]And what do you say we get started, guys?
[07:56.00]Here we are.
[07:57.18]Move on from this.
[07:59.24]We're gonna play...
[08:01.82]You know, like, get the fuck out of here.
[08:04.04]With, with, with... Jimmy Fallon.
[08:06.74]I don't even know.
[08:07.56]New game.
[08:08.58]I don't know how this game works.
[08:10.27]I don't... So you guys think that when I play these, like, games, I, like, research anything or I look at anything?
[08:15.71]No.
[08:16.29]All I know is that you're, like, a fucking Super Mario Piranha Plant and you have a club.
[08:20.73]I don't know anything else.
[08:21.51]There's, there's no... I don't, like, watch these games.
[08:25.93]I know that you, like, have to climb a mountain and it's hard and it's aggravating.
[08:32.59]But I might need to change- alright, so I can do that.
[08:34.32]I'm gonna- I gotta turn this up a little bit, it's way too low.
[08:39.42]Let's turn this up.
[08:40.92]Mois- Mois!
[08:42.84]Moisic!
[08:43.20]Is that better?
[08:46.64]Sounds a little better.
[08:50.47]Better?
[08:54.13]Well, now I'm hanging on for dear life.
[08:58.77]Do you die in this game?
[09:00.29]What happens if you die?
[09:12.02]Okay, uh So you do die in this game, but does dying matter?
[09:17.59]What like what happened?
[09:18.63]Okay, so you can do you can do a little like onesie twosie here.
[09:21.03]I like that So you just use this as a walking stick here, here's the first obstacle Oh
[09:34.88]Okay, slow it down.
[09:37.20]I'm gonna aim it up like it'll hold like a katana.
[09:40.77]Yeah.
[09:41.39]Wait, let me go like this.
[09:43.93]Can I- can I- I'm gonna- I'm gonna patent this move.
[09:46.31]It's called the plunger.
[09:47.03]Let's see if I can do it.
[09:48.75]Yep, you can.
[09:52.49]I call this one singing in the rain.
[09:53.73]Come on, get that shit out of there!
[10:04.00]Okay, we're good?
[10:06.07]You guys told me this was going to be a hard game.
[10:07.75]Getting over it.
[10:08.31]I'm going to reach down and grab.
[10:13.51]Got it.
[10:16.17]Okay.
[10:18.01]Alright, let's just, we got a new move.
[10:19.25]We call this one the Gandalf.
[10:21.59]So we got the plunger, the Gandalf, the singer in the rain.
[10:24.81]I already got shit patented.
[10:30.02]You don't want to go like, you know, that's one thing you don't want to do.
[10:31.90]You don't want to go fast.
[10:34.40]I've seen people, like, fucking rage at this game where they go to- It's all about the plunger move.
[10:38.66]No, I got it.
[10:39.56]Watch this one.
[10:42.09]I bet you nobody, like, ever- Is this Mewzel talking?
[10:44.39]See?
[10:44.59]Red pens!
[10:45.25]Fuck them.
[11:05.73]Alrighty, I'm gonna do this hard.
[11:06.55]It's gonna go... Shit.
[11:07.13]I get it.
[11:07.53]Okay, I'm gonna plunge over this one.
[11:10.11]Ooooooh!
[11:10.35]Excuse me!
[11:10.99]Excuse me!
[11:11.31]I told ya!
[11:13.13]You gotta plunge.
[11:37.16]How can I look?
[11:40.26]It's a little quiet?
[11:41.08]Oh, I'll turn it up.
[11:41.62]Hold on.
[11:43.76]How do you save the game?
[11:44.60]Are there checkpoints?
[11:50.81]That should be better.
[11:52.33]Hey!
[11:53.73]Alright, what's the... How can I even see what's over here?
[12:00.61]Now I'm trying to pry open a fucking can of tomatoes.
[12:03.77]Alright, here we go.
[12:08.77]Okay, I got it.
[12:09.25]Facecam?
[12:09.43]No, I don't have any clothes on.
[12:10.43]I can't do facecam.
[12:11.69]Alright, so every time he talks, he saves.
[12:12.99]So the guy starts speaking, and that means the game is saved.
[12:14.59]No, I have... This is... Alright, no, you can't lose here.
[12:16.07]I got it.
[12:16.29]There we go.
[12:17.21]We're going to go straight up.
[12:42.31]And up.
[12:44.63]Nope.
[12:44.91]I gotta get up to that lip right there.
[12:50.07]I'm gonna be utilizing the plunger.
[12:52.15]It actually saves every second.
[12:53.91]It does.
[12:54.93]Alright, well, nice.
[12:55.57]There we go.
[12:56.92]I'm gonna get over it pretty easily then.
[12:59.02]Got an angle here.
[13:01.10]Chimney sweep.
[13:02.80]No, almost.
[13:05.18]I'm not gonna get angry on the stream.
[13:10.11]This is like, I'm like the guy that, oh, look at how angry he's gonna get.
[13:14.20]This game is fucking hard.
[13:17.22]I saw this streamer, whatever his name was.
[13:20.34]Twitch TV Slush, fucking whatever.
[13:24.32]He like spit in his mother's face and then like threw his keyboard out his window because he's died in getting over it.
[13:30.93]It's not gonna be me.
[13:35.69]This is gonna be difficult, though.
[13:41.27]Can I just, like, can I slowly reach up here and, like, hook this?
[13:46.18]Come on, give him the Gandalf.
[13:48.88]Come on.
[13:56.39]Yep.
[13:57.19]Yeah, guys, sorry.
[13:58.85]I've played Worms before.
[14:02.51]This game is a homage to a free game that came out in 2002, titled Sexy Hiking.
[14:07.03]Sexy hiking.
[14:07.85]Woo!
[14:07.97]What is this fucking narrator?
[14:09.95]Plunger right up the middle.
[14:11.69]Nope.
[14:11.97]No!
[14:12.15]Get over it!
[14:12.81]God damn it.
[14:14.37]Get over it.
[14:15.29]I had it right there.
[14:46.91]No, that wasn't anger.
[14:47.81]That was me saying the title of the game.
[14:49.62]I had... I just tried to... I tried to go too fast.
[14:54.16]I'm gonna go like this.
[14:55.34]Plunge it.
[15:00.22]You don't... You can't go fast in this game.
[15:03.30]You can't.
[15:05.52]I gotta get to here, and then I'm gonna reach around.
[15:07.46]I'm gonna Gandalf up there.
[15:09.54]Spin it around.
[15:14.10]Okay, slow...
[15:19.66]I'm going to be fine.
[15:20.20]You have to just pretend like it's real.
[15:25.58]You know what I mean?
[15:29.53]If this were real, I wouldn't want to fall.
[15:36.03]I'm a little too far away.
[15:37.15]Shit.
[15:38.09]All right.
[15:38.53]Move like this.
[15:40.11]Go like that.
[15:40.98]There we go.
[15:51.10]Okay, we're back to where we were.
[15:53.94]I can't Gandalf this.
[15:55.04]I have to go up.
[15:58.30]So we're gonna go up like this.
[16:00.18]And then I'm gonna try swinging it around and we'll hook it around.
[16:05.32]Like that.
[16:07.00]Let go, please.
[16:07.98]No, let go.
[16:08.50]Let go of it.
[16:09.44]Let go.
[16:10.73]No.
[16:14.45]I so badly want to just, like, dive this down.
[16:17.13]I think I'm gonna.
[16:17.67]No, I'm not.
[16:19.09]That's a fucking mistake.
[16:23.48]Sometimes, yeah, I gotta get over this thing, you know what I mean?
[16:28.27]Like that.
[16:29.45]This part is a little bit more difficult.
[16:30.97]Just don't fucking freak out.
[16:35.05]Sit down.
[16:36.49]Set it down, please.
[16:37.19]Alright, now I should be able to latch on here.
[16:41.21]I'm sweating.
[16:44.78]You gotta do it quick.
[16:45.48]It's gotta be a bingo.
[16:50.68]I didn't do it fast enough.
[17:02.23]I'm still learning.
[17:06.92]Once I get over this house, it'll be over.
[17:13.58]Can I play this with the controller?
[17:22.06]Pull it down.
[17:22.60]Do it again.
[17:29.66]Alright, now I can't lose here.
[17:31.70]Because I'm like wedged in.
[17:34.11]Back up, I'm getting the hang of it.
[17:39.53]Oh god dammit, how the fuck do you get over this one?
[17:42.53]How are you supposed to get over that?
[17:47.96]There's no divot, I think I have to just launch up there.
[17:55.68]How do you get over the house?
[18:11.88]I think I have to just shoot up.
[18:14.82]I have to shoot straight up here.
[18:15.90]Alright, let's see what happens if I do this.
[18:20.99]I'm just gonna go like this.
[18:22.23]I'm just gonna peek over the house.
[18:29.05]I gotta go hard.
[18:30.53]I gotta go hard and it's gonna be... I gotta get a downward motion on the roof.
[18:34.96]Don't do that, though.
[18:35.80]Get off the fucking tree branch, please.
[18:39.04]What position am I in right now?
[18:40.24]It doesn't make any sense.
[18:43.06]No.
[18:43.34]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[18:47.17]Sometimes you gotta fucking just go for it.
[18:48.67]You know what I mean?
[18:51.47]Almost there.
[18:55.35]Just don't... I gotta get flush.
[18:59.55]Flush to the fucking crystal.
[19:01.93]No, no, no, no, no.
[19:02.89]Flush.
[19:06.17]Just prime it, prime the butter.
[19:10.23]Oh boy, this is not good.
[19:11.37]Easy, easy.
[19:15.23]Pull over this way.
[19:15.99]Do I gotta go inside the tunnel?
[19:23.30]No, you don't go inside the tunnel.
[19:28.00]Straight up and down.
[19:28.68]There we are.
[19:32.39]In a certain way, sexy hiking is the perfect embodiment of a B-game.
[19:36.77]It's built almost entirely out of found and recycled parts.
[19:39.28]Oh man, you slide down this fucking thing.
[19:40.76]It's one of the most unusual and unfriendly games of its time.
[19:42.86]Oh, how unfair!
[19:44.14]In it, your task is simply to drag yourself up a mountain with a hammer.
[19:48.50]That act of climbing... You use my EXTREME upper body strength!
[19:52.50]...properties that give the game its flavor.
[19:54.58]Ooh!
[19:55.38]No amount of forward progress is guaranteed.
[19:57.76]Some cliffs are too sheer or too slippery.
[20:00.84]And the player is constantly, unremittingly... Stop!
[20:04.14]I'm going to wait until this guy stops talking.
[20:07.54]I'm going to wait until the dev commentary is done.
[20:12.68]Excuse me.
[20:14.28]Excuse me.
[20:15.02]I'll take that victory a thousand times.
[20:16.94]Alright, watch out for the coffee.
[20:21.31]The coffee's going to spill on my face and it's going to burn me or something, isn't it?
[20:30.74]Easy.
[20:31.98]Don't move.
[20:33.32]Nobody fucking move.
[20:37.66]Nobody move.
[20:39.84]Just be quiet.
[20:41.35]Be careful.
[20:42.07]Nobody move.
[20:44.21]Don't move.
[20:48.75]Don't go straight up here.
[20:50.01]Here we go.
[20:50.31]I gotta straighten this out.
[20:51.49]And then we got bingo.
[20:53.04]Bango.
[20:55.56]Again.
[20:56.02]Bingo.
[20:58.25]anyway when you start sexy hiking don't do it tree that blocks the way to the entire rest of the game it might take you an hour to get over that tree people never got past it prod and you poke at it exploring wait for the dev commentary to be over trying to find a way up and over and there's a sense of truth in that lack of compromise most obstacles in video game worlds are fake you can be completely confident in your ability to get through them
[21:24.28]This one's gonna be hard.
[21:26.61]I gotta get the right angle here.
[21:30.93]Oh boy.
[21:34.93]Here we go.
[21:35.53]I think I got a good shot here.
[21:40.67]It's alright.
[21:41.97]I got the right idea.
[21:43.61]Just gonna... When you come... No, it's gotta be the other way.
[21:46.21]It's gotta be the other way.
[21:49.17]I gotta come up.
[21:50.35]Out and up.
[21:51.23]Out and around.
[21:53.06]Where are you?
[21:54.65]I'm fine.
[22:02.63]You're gonna hear lots of those noises tonight.
[22:05.62]You're gonna hear lots of, like, way-o-do-doys tonight, for sure.
[22:12.02]I can guarantee you that.
[22:14.80]I don't like where I am here.
[22:18.50]Oh my god.
[22:19.30]What?
[22:24.20]What?
[22:26.43]Alright, now I understand.
[22:33.65]I get it, I get it.
[22:34.65]You can't just, you can't... Alright, that was a, that was a please scream.
[22:42.27]Please scream on three.
[22:45.26]I'm recording a, I'm recording a video.
[22:47.06]Can you do like a scream for me, Jeremy?
[22:51.30]Ah!
[22:53.48]Ugh.
[22:55.73]That's how you get yourself in trouble, is when you whip it around.
[23:00.39]If you're slow, just be slow.
[23:03.58]There's no reason to go that fast, you're just gonna get yourself fucked up.
[23:10.12]Set it right here, put it down.
[23:14.16]Yeah, nice scream sound effect from like an audio library.
[23:23.48]Don't say no, I'm doing fine.
[23:27.10]Wow.
[23:28.68]That's probably not... Wait, wait, wait.
[23:30.67]Let me just pull myself over here.
[23:35.03]That's too dangerous.
[23:40.49]You can't whip it around like crazy.
[23:41.89]That's how you lose.
[23:43.15]I need to be over there.
[23:49.50]Don't go like that.
[23:51.24]Fuck, man.
[23:51.74]Come on.
[23:58.40]Easy.
[23:59.70]Easy.
[24:00.48]I think I can get it if I let go.
[24:02.04]I need to take a shaky hand.
[24:05.56]I'm going to shake my hand for a second.
[24:08.20]No, I'm not going to launch myself.
[24:09.69]Are you serious?
[24:10.31]I'll end up in the bottom of the ocean.
[24:15.55]Right here.
[24:19.29]Let's just use the strength.
[24:20.65]If I'm messing you up, you can mute me in the settings.
[24:23.65]I will.
[24:23.99]I'm going to do that.
[24:31.53]Here we go.
[24:39.37]Okay.
[24:40.65]Here we are again.
[24:42.34]How the f- It's gotta be a perfect, like, yoink, right up there.
[24:48.66]I gotta go across, and then I can- But I'm gonna hit the ceiling here.
[24:57.42]It's gotta be a straight shot, like, right from here.
[25:02.78]Can I just push myself up?
[25:06.24]Let's take a look.
[25:06.96]If I push myself up and whip it around, what's going to happen?
[25:11.72]I have to go just a little bit.
[25:19.59]Just a little bit.
[25:20.23]Let's give it a go.
[25:20.75]That was close.
[25:26.69]Oh, boy.
[25:27.41]We got it.
[25:28.01]We got it.
[25:29.11]We got it.
[25:30.33]We got it.
[25:30.69]Just wedge.
[25:31.19]I don't care.
[25:31.53]I'll fit in eventually.
[25:34.14]Get in there.
[25:35.98]Get in there.
[25:36.58]Yes!
[25:38.42]Alright, now we take a victory snooze.
[25:43.63]Victory snooze.
[25:44.21]We're good.
[25:49.01]How about... We're going to get to that side.
[25:50.97]So we're going to very easily just give it a one pump.
[25:58.60]Got the pump.
[26:00.98]Now, do I go for the sideways pump?
[26:04.02]Should I go to the trash can?
[26:07.61]I wonder.
[26:09.51]I think this is a better way to go.
[26:10.91]I'm going to go up to the left.
[26:14.23]I feel like this is the harder way, but I have less chance to fall down.
[26:17.70]Let's do it up here.
[26:23.83]But I'm not sure Jasuo intended to make a frustrating game.
[26:27.04]The frustration is just essential to the act of climbing, and it's authentic to the process of building a game about climbing.
[26:34.66]A funny thing happened to me as I was building this one.
[26:37.60]I'd have an idea for a new obstacle, and I'd build it.
[26:40.52]And it would usually turn out to be unreasonably hard.
[26:45.25]But I couldn't bring myself to make it easier.
[26:47.59]It already felt like my inability to get past the new obstacle was my fault as a player rather than as a builder.
[26:54.50]Come on now Easy easy easy.
[26:55.72]Thank you.
[26:56.36]Thank you for being easy calm down here.
[26:58.40]Come on We're gonna go right up the tunnel.
[27:00.02]This is super meat boy tunnel is that we did with that.
[27:02.05]We have no there's no problem here.
[27:04.63]Oh
[27:24.26]I just gotta get myself situated with a pump and then a respective fall.
[27:32.76]That's okay.
[27:34.80]Alright, one more pump.
[27:37.66]When you're building a video game world, you're building with ideas.
[27:41.10]Got it.
[27:41.36]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[27:42.63]Watch this one.
[27:43.87]Alright, we're gonna sink it in the rain here.
[27:45.67]Nope.
[27:45.81]Hmm.
[27:45.89]I wonder.
[27:46.37]I wonder.
[28:11.19]I gotta like wiggle up there.
[28:16.71]Go straight up.
[28:22.54]How?
[28:23.60]How are you supposed to get up this one?
[28:29.92]No sudden movements.
[28:32.12]Just get back in the right position.
[28:40.14]I think I have to throw myself up here.
[28:44.44]I think, I understand this.
[28:46.97]I have to go over here.
[28:51.77]And I gotta get it wedged right fucking here.
[28:54.33]And I gotta throw myself up.
[28:57.49]That's what's gonna have to happen.
[28:58.38]I gotta watch out for the rock.
[28:59.94]Let's give it a try.
[29:01.84]I'm going to slingshot myself up here.
[29:04.74]A little bit further.
[29:05.86]Maybe a little bit.
[29:08.81]Like right here.
[29:11.25]Right here.
[29:12.83]Nope, that didn't do a damn thing.
[29:21.47]Whoa, buddy!
[29:22.79]Slow it down.
[29:28.56]Show them what you're fucking made of.
[29:30.86]Easy money.
[29:32.06]Easy money.
[29:34.26]Easy money.
[29:36.04]Easy money.
[29:40.54]Easy money.
[29:42.06]Easy money.
[29:49.68]Wait, what is that?
[29:50.78]Hold on.
[29:52.00]Ah!
[29:54.12]We're fine.
[29:58.47]Oh my god, the lamps.
[29:59.47]Oh my god, the lamps, the lamps, the lamps.
[30:00.63]How do I get the lamps?
[30:04.89]Hmm.
[30:07.71]Lamps.
[30:08.53]Oh, can I reach up there?
[30:09.55]I think I can get up here.
[30:12.63]Stick that.
[30:15.51]I need to get up there.
[30:17.11]And get that lamp.
[30:18.85]How the fuck are you supposed to grab that lamp?
[30:20.77]You can't even swing.
[30:27.75]God damn it.
[30:31.68]Get up there.
[30:35.16]How am I supposed to grab that lamp?
[30:38.24]Let me look at this.
[30:38.88]I can't reach it from here.
[30:41.50]Ow.
[30:41.80]Fuck.
[30:47.86]So narrow.
[30:52.04]Ah.
[30:53.66]Holy shit.
[30:54.24]Where am I?
[30:54.52]What am I doing here?
[30:56.08]All right.
[30:56.66]Well, we made it.
[30:58.38]I got into the tunnel.
[31:02.28]I got into the tunnel.
[31:06.03]Can the hammer break?
[31:07.81]Because it's bending in a way that I have not seen yet.
[31:11.65]God damn it.
[31:12.13]I didn't do this yet.
[31:17.59]What?
[31:17.71]Don't talk to me like I've beaten this game before, dude.
[31:36.55]You've already beaten this game.
[31:45.50]Mocked.
[31:47.96]It thinks that you fell a long way.
[31:50.18]I didn't, did I?
[31:52.82]I almost got it.
[31:53.62]Look, if I'm going to fucking take some time to get it right, I'm going to do it on this one.
[31:57.76]And I ain't going to fucking lose here.
[32:02.36]That ain't going to happen.
[32:07.52]I can Garen fucking DMT you that.
[32:15.95]Almost.
[32:24.71]Try straight up again.
[32:29.45]Fuck.
[32:30.85]Ah!
[32:31.51]Streamer fakes blind playthrough?
[32:33.45]You want me to fucking exit and screenshot my Steam library?
[32:37.21]Would you like me to do that?
[32:38.42]You want me to exit Steam?
[32:39.42]You want me to exit the game and show time played in game?
[32:43.02]It is exactly 30 fucking two minutes.
[32:45.26]You want to see it?
[32:47.90]I will fucking exit this game.
[32:49.06]It's the game saves like you... I will go fucking show you the exact minutes.
[32:53.07]I will show it to you.
[32:56.97]I will show you my Steam DM there.
[33:04.27]I ain't gonna hear that.
[33:07.03]No, slow down.
[33:07.59]Don't be mad.
[33:08.45]I'm being, like, made fun of right now for no reason.
[33:18.49]Just getting the... Getting it back... Getting it inside of there is, like, the fucking worst.
[33:30.96]Because you can't... You can't reach from here.
[33:40.01]I'll be here for a while.
[33:40.97]It's okay.
[33:48.19]I'd rather be right here.
[33:54.49]Oh my god.
[33:55.23]Shit.
[33:55.55]Shit.
[33:56.47]Shit.
[33:57.57]Shit.
[33:58.54]Shit.
[34:03.45]You gotta get up here and then... This is gonna be so fucking annoying.
[34:12.41]You gotta be standing on the rock.
[34:15.60]That's like the way to do it.
[34:16.52]You gotta pump yourself onto the rock.
[34:23.58]Like the dev said, you've been here before.
[34:26.33]Let me tell you my life story.
[34:31.87]There it comes.
[34:33.13]Oh my god, you fucking really fell off that.
[34:37.60]Oh, just please get on there.
[34:43.02]Just get on there!
[34:44.10]God damn it!
[34:45.12]I thought you said I wasn't gonna stream this game?
[34:48.96]Well, I didn't think I was.
[34:53.03]But, it came out on Steam.
[34:54.49]The only reason why I didn't stream this game is because it was on the Humble Bundle store, and I don't, like, have... I don't have a Humble Bundle account.
[35:04.64]That second lantern is gonna fuck me up every time.
[35:11.22]I think I'm gonna go for a burger boy technique here, guys.
[35:14.34]Yeah, it's time.
[35:15.76]It's time for a burger boy technique.
[35:16.92]It might fuck me up, but you know what?
[35:17.98]Sometimes you gotta roll the dice and do a burger boy technique.
[35:20.83]This is what burger boy would do.
[35:38.40]Like fighting people next to him.
[35:56.55]That second fucking lantern.
[35:58.97]I haven't figured that out.
[36:00.83]Alright, let me figure this out.
[36:06.43]I got a minute here.
[36:08.00]I'm safely wedged here.
[36:09.02]So I have to throw myself... I have to push down and then try to go to the left and push up.
[36:24.31]Oh, for the love of God.
[36:25.43]For the love of God!
[36:26.33]What the fuck?
[36:27.11]There's not enough room to move in this fucking stupid chimney.
[36:37.44]Almost fucking blew it there.
[36:38.64]Like, there's not enough fucking room to move in there!
[36:42.23]I can't get angry, that's how you lose.
[36:51.91]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[36:53.13]Alright, like, there ain't enough fucking room to move in there.
[37:03.42]Off the trash can.
[37:09.25]Sorry.
[37:09.71]I'd rather be right here, actually.
[37:10.87]That's what I want.
[37:23.24]I don't want to be like this, though.
[37:30.76]Now, you ain't gonna get one of those moments with me, guys.
[37:32.47]I'm sorry.
[37:34.19]You're not going to get one of those movements.
[37:36.45]I'm not going to get one of those situations where I fly off the map and I go all the way off and everybody is fucking LOLs in the chat.
[37:42.08]Not going to happen here.
[37:43.58]That's just not going to happen.
[37:44.70]Because I know when to cut my losses.
[37:47.24]I know when to stop panicking.
[37:48.86]And I know when to pull it back together.
[37:52.48]Not going to get one of those moments.
[37:58.81]Now let's get the fuck up here and continue this and beat this.
[38:08.76]It's all about patience.
[38:10.56]Just getting on this rock.
[38:13.13]Not a big deal.
[38:13.77]Just throw yourself up there.
[38:17.03]Got one.
[38:20.37]Got two here.
[38:21.07]Got two.
[38:25.75]We've done it.
[38:26.43]We've done it.
[38:27.23]No, we haven't.
[38:27.61]We haven't done it.
[38:28.17]We have just easy.
[38:35.34]Is that tree blocking the way?
[38:38.97]Is that tree part of the game or is that an art asset?
[38:41.11]Is that a fucking art asset?
[38:42.71]It better not be.
[38:44.02]Is that tree an art asset?
[38:45.36]Somebody quickly tell me.
[38:53.16]For years now, people have been predicting that games would soon be made out of prefabricated objects.
[38:58.18]Bought in a store and assembled into a world.
[39:01.17]And for the most part, that hasn't happened.
[39:03.35]Because the objects in the stores are trash.
[39:07.06]Hello, anybody in there?
[39:08.76]Oh, joke almost ended the stream.
[39:10.87]The knock on the bathroom door joke almost ended the whole stream.
[39:14.73]What?
[39:29.64]Don't do that again.
[39:30.72]Don't do that again.
[39:32.58]Don't do that again.
[39:34.46]Don't do that again.
[39:35.42]Jeremy, easy now.
[39:37.12]Don't do that again.
[39:38.58]You don't have to do that shit again.
[39:40.69]You don't have to do that again.
[39:42.57]Like I'm trying to do like a stupid fucking joke.
[39:52.23]Everything is fine.
[39:54.17]Everybody relax.
[39:55.32]Everybody relax!
[39:57.72]Relax.
[39:59.64]I need to just get this out of here.
[40:01.04]I need to go like this.
[40:08.57]Everybody relax.
[40:11.51]I am like on fucking edge right now.
[40:16.61]I am so scared.
[40:17.97]Okay, we're fine.
[40:23.24]Alright, everything is fine.
[40:24.36]Wow.
[40:25.06]Wow.
[40:28.87]So, don't do that again.
[40:31.71]Just play it like you normally would and win.
[40:36.85]Get up on the outhouse.
[40:38.65]There's plenty of random things to grab.
[40:40.39]This is in a situation where I cannot freak out.
[40:43.43]Because I will launch myself over the edge.
[40:45.99]The other direction.
[40:47.77]That was horse shit.
[40:52.57]That was an absolute situation where I should have had that.
[40:54.77]You all know it.
[40:58.14]That's the game plan though.
[40:59.50]Just set her down.
[41:00.18]Nice and easy.
[41:03.06]Shake the hand a little, shake the hand.
[41:12.28]Just, any time you get in a situation like that in this game, just let go of the fucking mouse.
[41:17.52]Because you're going to end up going like this and I don't know what to do!
[41:21.43]And you'll fucking throw yourself off the cliff.
[41:22.95]So don't do that.
[41:30.34]Alright, let me... By the way, am I in water?
[41:37.12]Is that what this is?
[41:43.69]Just get up here.
[41:44.97]Slow down.
[41:48.91]Not a good spot.
[41:49.55]I've got to be on the edge.
[41:50.29]Right on the corner.
[41:52.35]Put it down right here.
[41:53.71]No, no, no, no.
[41:54.67]Like right here.
[41:57.11]That's not what I want, but let's try it.
[42:02.28]Okay.
[42:02.84]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[42:13.58]Pray.
[42:15.76]I got the edge here.
[42:19.23]Almost.
[42:19.73]Easy.
[42:22.43]Easy.
[42:23.19]Easy.
[42:25.59]Easy does it.
[42:29.00]Over time, we've poured more and more refuse into this vast digital landfill that we call the Internet.
[42:35.30]You're too small for this.
[42:38.81]How do I get up there?
[42:40.23]When everything around us is cultural trash, trash becomes the new medium.
[42:43.89]Can I move this?
[42:44.45]The lingua franca of the digital age.
[42:47.21]You can build culture out of trash, but only trash cultures.
[42:50.88]B-games, B-movies.
[42:53.57]Slow.
[42:55.71]How do I move this thing?
[42:57.93]Because I can't wedge through there.
[42:59.13]It's too small.
[43:00.15]I can't go through that.
[43:03.72]Can I, like, hit this?
[43:06.22]Come on, reach.
[43:10.92]Is that doing anything?
[43:11.80]How am I supposed to do this?
[43:12.72]I don't understand.
[43:21.58]I can't wedge through this.
[43:24.76]Let's sit right on the edge, and then... I got the grip here.
[43:32.92]That doesn't do anything.
[43:33.98]Maybe even further on the edge.
[43:42.57]Right here.
[43:43.81]Okay.
[43:50.24]Um...
[43:56.20]Huh?
[44:01.56]Huh?
[44:13.20]Are you kidding me?
[44:17.80]What's the game plan here guys?
[44:19.12]Holy shit!
[44:22.50]What's the game plan here?
[44:23.58]I gotta, like, shimmy?
[44:31.11]Oh my god, I have to shimmy it.
[44:32.77]Oh my god.
[44:34.59]At least I can't fall.
[44:39.09]Ow!
[44:40.67]I like how that hurt me.
[44:42.41]Pull up a little.
[44:49.00]This is too much.
[44:51.26]This is too much.
[44:51.94]There's a safe zone over here, right?
[44:57.42]Maybe this is what digital culture is.
[44:59.99]A monstrous mountain of trash.
[45:01.67]The ash heap of creativity's fountain.
[45:04.41]A landfill with everything we ever thought of in it.
[45:07.25]Grand, infinite, and unsorted.
[45:10.05]Hold on.
[45:16.29]Oh, fuck me.
[45:22.48]Holy shit, Batman.
[45:24.51]Holy jumping avocados, Batman.
[45:28.79]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[45:34.72]Do I go left?
[45:40.42]Am I going to fall through this platform?
[45:42.30]Am I going to fall through this platform?
[45:43.91]Just take a guess.
[45:45.63]No, I'm good.
[45:50.53]Thank God I have a minute here to, like, chill.
[45:57.51]I know I'm gonna go too fast.
[45:58.91]There's, like, chutes and ladders over there.
[46:00.47]I don't want to play with that.
[46:01.28]Okay, we got left.
[46:08.78]I could also go up to the bathtub.
[46:12.90]Which one of these is, like, the way I want to go?
[46:15.52]And is there... Is this solid?
[46:18.29]Sometimes you gotta test if it's solid or not.
[46:19.49]Okay, I can go up or left.
[46:20.43]Okay, up is... Let's just check up.
[46:30.05]What can I do?
[46:30.63]Should I touch the grill?
[46:31.95]Grill?
[46:32.09]Let's just see what the grill does.
[46:33.43]It's probably some stupid thing that you guys have never known.
[46:35.67]Hold on.
[46:35.85]I'm not going to go up.
[46:36.72]I ain't going that way.
[46:37.92]I want to see what the bathtub is.
[46:59.50]As long as I don't fucking blow this right here.
[47:04.78]Get over the satellite dish.
[47:06.28]Into the bathtub.
[47:07.02]Alright, now what?
[47:12.05]What do I do now?
[47:16.45]I don't know.
[47:17.37]The bathtub.
[47:20.53]Did I do it?
[47:24.21]I'm gonna fall.
[47:24.77]I'm gonna fall through that.
[47:30.82]Everyone's, like, screaming at me right now.
[47:33.94]Throw yourself off with a joke.
[47:39.03]Is it funny commentary when I, like, sit in the bathtub?
[47:43.05]Is it like, oh, you just cleaned yourself, right?
[47:44.87]It's gonna be something like that.
[47:45.83]Let's just do it.
[47:50.39]I'm playing with fire here.
[47:54.00]Did I win?
[47:54.48]Do you just have to go in the bathtub?
[47:55.96]Oh.
[47:59.30]Everything's fresh for about six seconds until some new way to go and we hit refresh and there's years of persevering Disappearing into the pile out of style out of sight left.
[48:10.23]We're gonna go left In this context it's tempting to make friendly content.
[48:16.85]It's gentle We're gonna jump from the ground make something demanding if it just gets piled up in the landfill Filed in with the bland they're gonna sit right on the grill.
[48:26.27]Oh
[48:29.43]Streamer's not doing what I told him.
[48:31.57]I ain't trying to speedrun.
[48:32.47]I'm just trying to survive.
[48:37.51]Just survive.
[48:38.35]And some people might say, Dude, come on!
[48:41.16]Hurry up!
[48:41.58]You're going so slow!
[48:42.78]Yeah.
[48:44.30]And guess what else I haven't done yet?
[48:47.86]The bullshit that you guys are all waiting for.
[48:50.62]The, he fell down into the water and it's over.
[48:53.82]Now he has to go back from the fucking checkpoint from all the way, all the way back.
[48:58.70]Three...
[48:59.71]Two, one, action.
[49:04.55]I don't know what to do.
[49:05.27]Should I grab?
[49:05.83]Okay, we're good.
[49:16.63]Oh my god.
[49:17.96]No, no, no.
[49:19.46]That's not gonna work.
[49:20.56]How is this gonna work?
[49:21.98]I'm gonna fucking fly off the edge.
[49:26.48]I'm gonna fly off the edge here.
[49:28.50]Can I go into the house?
[49:30.07]Nope.
[49:34.69]Not today.
[49:36.74]Not today, guys.
[49:38.84]Not today.
[49:39.52]Not today.
[49:44.96]You see?
[49:45.36]That's what happens when you just be cool about it.
[49:49.52]I'm not in the right angle.
[49:51.00]Now I am.
[49:57.20]I gotta grab a rake?
[49:59.04]How am I gonna get this rake?
[50:02.60]Oh lord, how am I gonna get the rake?
[50:09.75]Not today!
[50:10.29]No, I feel safer if I go like this.
[50:15.55]Just pull myself.
[50:19.52]Somebody get ready to clip.
[50:20.48]It's not gonna happen.
[50:21.12]Didn't you hear me say not today?
[50:23.98]Not happening today.
[50:25.58]Not today.
[50:33.46]This is such a bad angle to be on.
[50:35.11]I have to go really slow to get up this.
[50:43.43]Ayayay.
[50:48.89]He's setting up for it.
[50:50.31]I'm not setting up for anything.
[50:51.49]I'm trying to win.
[50:52.93]Not today!
[50:56.54]Not today.
[50:57.06]See?
[51:01.31]You got to go straight up from here.
[51:04.45]Right here.
[51:08.73]That's not what I wanted.
[51:09.53]I want to sit right here on the edge of the umbrella.
[51:13.15]Okay.
[51:15.45]No, I don't want that.
[51:16.13]I want to be like a little bit further out.
[51:18.28]Like right here.
[51:20.04]Right here.
[51:20.58]Not today.
[51:21.64]Say it with me, everybody.
[51:22.36]Three, two, one.
[51:24.30]Not today.
[51:28.58]Not today.
[51:30.92]What's up here?
[51:32.40]A fucking slide.
[51:33.76]You think I'm going to go over a slide?
[51:35.28]I ain't going to go over a slide.
[51:38.04]How am I going to get over a slide?
[51:39.30]It's a slippery slide.
[51:40.30]Not today!
[51:40.56]Not today, it seems!
[52:20.26]Come on, I have like one more Mario life left.
[52:23.34]Straight up is gonna knock me to the right.
[52:25.04]Not gonna do it that way.
[52:26.50]I think I'm gonna go back to the grill.
[52:35.50]I just fucked myself.
[52:38.66]I did.
[52:39.92]I completely fucked myself.
[52:40.84]Because now I'm slowly but surely wedging further in here.
[52:44.76]Nice.
[52:45.26]Nice.
[52:45.58]Good job.
[52:46.10]I turned myself into a cannon.
[52:47.44]Can I shoot myself out of the cannon?
[52:55.19]I'm going to go straight up.
[52:56.59]I have to.
[52:58.77]But I need to get right on the edge of the plank.
[53:04.30]Like right here.
[53:06.66]And then out.
[53:08.68]There we go.
[53:09.10]Got it.
[53:11.20]Oh my god.
[53:12.03]He doesn't have it.
[53:12.85]He don't have it.
[53:14.57]Right there.
[53:15.67]Here we go.
[53:17.19]Say a fucking prayer, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:21.65]Not today.
[53:24.60]Not today.
[53:25.18]Another chance.
[53:25.70]Here we go.
[53:28.18]We're almost at this.
[53:29.22]We got another life.
[53:32.20]I rolled the bullet bill all the way to fucking... Hold the jokes.
[53:39.97]I'm not making any more fucking dumb references or jokes.
[53:43.31]Until I get past the birdhouse.
[53:48.96]That's a fucking promise.
[53:55.70]Once I get past the fucking birdhouse.
[53:57.94]Here we go.
[54:02.91]Let's see it.
[54:05.75]Slow it down.
[54:06.21]Slow it down.
[54:07.45]Right here.
[54:14.96]This is a bad spot.
[54:16.28]Because I need to straighten it out.
[54:17.36]Like right here.
[54:19.38]Right like there.
[54:22.34]Getting like weak hands.
[54:26.02]Slow it down.
[54:27.96]Pull it in a little bit too.
[54:29.02]I got to come in.
[54:31.40]This is not a good angle for this.
[54:34.07]Okay, here we go Not today This is too much this is too hard do it can I did I is it is this like who wants to be a millionaire I
[54:57.11]Can I, like, cash out right now and just say, like, I got to, like, the $500,000 question?
[55:01.86]And, like, at least I have the respect that I got to the $500,000 and I took the money when I knew I was going to have to take it?
[55:09.28]Because if I don't, I'm going to lose the whole thing.
[55:10.78]I'm going to go down to zero.
[55:21.53]No, not...
[55:26.93]God damn it.
[55:27.71]This part sucks.
[55:30.09]Of course they have to put like a slide.
[55:31.31]And this has to be on an incline too.
[55:32.95]Of course it does.
[55:36.47]You're not wrong.
[55:45.26]Let's go right here.
[55:49.06]We're okay.
[55:49.44]Not today.
[55:50.94]Just put us in a weird spot.
[55:53.56]But not that weird because this is actually not that hard of a jump.
[55:58.19]Just gotta go like that.
[56:05.73]Don't fucking throw yourself down.
[56:14.21]Oh, man.
[56:16.17]Pull yourself in.
[56:20.15]I'm so sweaty.
[56:22.23]Go right?
[56:22.87]What do you mean go right?
[56:25.80]Why would I want to go right?
[56:31.03]Oh, you slippery little shit.
[56:35.59]I almost just freaked out right there.
[56:36.91]Let's just go with the jump.
[56:38.61]Get up there.
[56:39.09]I got a good grab.
[56:42.29]Sit it back down again and try it again.
[56:46.90]What do you mean there's a shortcut below?
[56:50.82]I don't believe that for a second.
[56:52.48]You want me to go below?
[56:53.46]You want me to fall down?
[56:56.61]I hit the wrong... Look, you can tell I'm starting to lose my mind here.
[57:01.35]I just went the wrong way with the mouse.
[57:03.19]I just threw myself down.
[57:08.02]That's a good thing I did it right there, though.
[57:18.18]There we go.
[57:20.07]There's a good hook right here.
[57:21.43]Good hook.
[57:23.27]Good hook.
[57:25.77]Mmm.
[57:27.98]Not today!
[57:28.63]I don't know what to do.
[57:45.32]I'm gonna try to play it safe.
[57:50.23]Okay.
[58:06.16]Take the $50,000.
[58:06.86]Honestly, I would take the fucking $50,000 here.
[58:11.30]Regis Philbin is staring at me.
[58:12.82]I've been on the same question for like 30 minutes.
[58:15.16]You know, like in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
[58:17.46]It's just like... Regis has repeated the question like 41 times.
[58:25.07]And I'm sitting there with my hand on my chin.
[58:26.71]I don't know.
[58:27.85]Should I take the money?
[58:29.77]I've been on the same question for like 30 minutes.
[58:38.70]What is the name of the medication that is used to treat arthritis?
[58:43.48]Is it A, Imodium, B, Humira, C, Advil, or D?
[59:01.70]None of the above.
[59:04.74]I'm going to have to go with none of the above.
[59:07.16]Regis!
[59:11.30]Holy shit!
[59:14.32]Up or, up, up, up, I don't know, I don't know, up, I don't know.
[59:16.28]I'm gonna stay right here.
[59:21.00]C!
[59:21.48]Advil!
[59:21.96]Correct!
[59:28.79]I don't know what to do.
[59:30.25]Should I go left or right?
[59:34.23]That, this kid on the ladder looks like he has potential here.
[59:44.56]I'm seeing a lot of people saying, right, I don't know, I don't know, can I grab those boxes?
[59:51.38]Go to the trash, go to the trash?
[59:54.84]Go to the trash?
[59:56.04]Alright, let's like, be easy here.
[59:59.28]I have to go for a good jump and dump here.
[60:11.74]Got it.
[60:12.80]Got it, buddy.
[60:14.08]Got it, buddy.
[60:16.24]We're right.
[60:21.70]What can I grab onto here?
[60:24.16]Is there a safe place?
[60:25.04]Is there a spot that I can get to?
[60:26.56]What do I do here?
[60:31.41]I gotta go.
[60:32.15]Where do I gotta go?
[60:34.99]Down.
[60:38.63]Down?
[60:41.89]You're not supposed to go down in this game.
[60:44.31]What do you mean go down?
[60:45.45]Go down?
[60:50.56]What about that shelf right there?
[60:51.90]What about that shelf right over here?
[60:54.16]I better be careful and stop being like the teacher with the pointer.
[61:00.46]I don't trust you guys.
[61:01.10]I don't...
[61:12.37]Go do it for the golden goose.
[61:24.15]I don't think there's a way out of here.
[61:32.98]It's all right.
[61:34.66]We're good.
[61:35.02]Not today.
[61:35.54]Deep frustration.
[61:36.60]A real punch in the gut.
[61:42.63]There's no way.
[61:44.09]How the fuck are you supposed to do that shit?
[61:48.11]Explain that to me, Regis.
[61:50.55]I ain't going right again.
[61:51.33]We're going left.
[61:53.91]You guys threw me down like the box pit.
[62:03.35]God damn it!
[62:14.92]See, now I'm rushing.
[62:15.64]I'm trying to rush because now I'm like annoyed.
[62:20.14]You don't want to turn into the Noid, okay?
[62:22.32]He's like the shitty Pizza Hut mascot.
[62:24.50]Nobody wants to be the Pizza Hut mascot.
[62:25.88]He's like a rabbit, like claymation fucking Gumby asshole.
[62:29.54]You don't want to be the Noid.
[62:31.03]The Nord.
[62:31.55]What's his name?
[62:44.15]I'm good.
[62:48.10]I ain't gonna be the fucking Noid.
[62:49.46]Yeah, what a cool mascot.
[62:54.07]He, like, jumped around on a pogo stick.
[63:02.45]Got it.
[63:02.81]Okay.
[63:03.63]Get back up there, and we're gonna go left this time.
[63:11.96]God damn it.
[63:13.32]No.
[63:15.12]Oh, easy.
[63:15.78]Don't fuck this up.
[63:18.73]Did you hear what I just said, Jeremy?
[63:20.87]Jeremy, are you listening?
[63:22.25]Are you listening to me talk?
[63:24.38]Stop talking and listen to me.
[63:29.14]Listen to me.
[63:31.10]Turn.
[63:32.48]Plunge it.
[63:33.48]Grab.
[63:34.38]Grab.
[63:35.42]Pull.
[63:35.98]Grab.
[63:37.88]Plunge it.
[63:39.48]Plunge it.
[63:40.08]Bop it.
[63:41.04]Twist it.
[63:43.22]Bop it.
[63:44.28]Okay.
[63:44.98]Here we go.
[63:47.76]Plunge it.
[63:48.72]Bop it.
[64:00.39]God damn it!
[64:01.33]Why am I having so much trouble with this now?
[64:08.79]This was not that hard before.
[64:13.85]I really am the fucking Noid.
[64:15.27]I'm in like a stupid canister.
[64:19.53]What did he do?
[64:19.91]What?
[64:20.03]I might as well, like, shove pizzas up my ass.
[64:26.68]Stay here.
[64:29.40]I gotta line this up correctly, and then we gotta be careful.
[64:33.89]What are you doing?
[64:34.51]Why are you shimmying over here?
[64:35.73]No, pull back this way.
[64:45.22]Ain't gonna be a fucking noid today.
[64:48.03]Oh, maybe I will.
[64:48.93]Maybe I am going to be annoyed.
[64:50.15]I'm currently stuck in between.
[64:55.24]See this peg right here?
[64:56.14]We're okay.
[65:02.24]Alright, let's go up and to the left.
[65:03.62]It doesn't look that dangerous to me.
[65:07.21]We're going to hook that kid right in his skull and I'm going to launch over him.
[65:17.96]Okay, easy.
[65:19.94]We're gonna hook over here.
[65:24.55]That's not even real.
[65:26.57]This made it a lot more difficult now.
[65:28.93]What's up here?
[65:34.25]Oh lord, that ain't... Not today.
[65:43.90]Not today, not today, not today!
[65:48.72]Pull yourself in.
[65:51.70]Get it together.
[65:55.20]Shake the hand.
[66:08.72]Shoo!
[66:27.93]I'm so fucking angry!
[66:30.89]No, I'm not.
[66:31.61]I'm not.
[66:31.95]I'm okay.
[66:32.35]I haven't done anything stupid yet.
[66:33.59]What do you mean there's nothing there?
[66:37.45]Whoa is right.
[66:38.77]Easy, buddy.
[66:46.26]Slow down.
[66:46.98]Slow down.
[66:48.00]Slow down.
[66:49.50]Slow down.
[66:51.74]Slow down.
[66:52.20]I need to take a second here.
[66:55.30]Slow down, buddy.
[66:56.68]None of this bullshit.
[66:57.72]Slow it down.
[67:01.98]You're causing yourself way too much stress right now.
[67:03.76]Just get up there, get up the slide, and then I... Apparently there's nothing up there.
[67:11.22]Am I being played like a fucking idiot, or is there actually nothing up on the slide over there?
[67:20.08]Uh...
[67:33.39]I just want to get past this fucking stupid part.
[67:35.83]There's nothing over there.
[67:42.55]So I actually have to go over to the right.
[67:44.77]Are you kidding me?
[68:01.37]You know that feel, I'm getting, I don't know, I gotta move my hands here.
[68:04.61]I'm getting that feeling where I just wanna shake the fucking mouse around and like just shake it around.
[68:08.39]Anybody else get that feeling when they play a game like this?
[68:16.62]You just wanna shake the fucking mouse instead and like in circles?
[68:25.76]Oh my god, please, no!
[68:32.25]I'm losing it.
[68:33.35]I'm starting to lose it.
[68:34.39]I can feel it.
[68:35.13]I can feel my brain starting to forget how to play video games.
[68:41.98]You know what I'm saying?
[68:42.64]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[68:43.76]I don't know how to play games anymore.
[68:55.79]Sweat cam?
[68:56.25]You don't need a sweat cam.
[68:57.89]Because I don't have a shirt on and it is pouring out of me.
[69:02.15]This is the sweatiest I've ever been in my life, I think.
[69:04.19]Like, in my whole life.
[69:10.21]I'm sweating more than if it was like 100 degrees in hot yoga.
[69:20.87]I just had it right there, too.
[69:29.13]What are you thinking doing this?
[69:31.07]Why am I doing it like that?
[69:33.19]Slow... I'm fucking... I gotta slow down.
[69:39.46]That's not slowing it down.
[69:42.18]Now that is, but like you fucked it up anyways.
[69:44.10]Alright, shake the hand.
[69:50.58]I've had my hand on my, like, neck.
[69:52.52]My left hand has been, like, grabbing my neck.
[69:55.86]This whole time.
[69:57.54]It probably... My neck probably looks like somebody was strangling me.
[70:01.08]I did not move my hand for, like, an hour.
[70:02.34]Oh, my fucking lord.
[70:15.00]Do you want to talk about like a game with like a how many percentage percentile of people that probably got past like the first 10 minutes Ain't that many I would assume All right, let's go Oh my god, just get over here I don't doing it again.
[70:40.84]I'm doing it again.
[70:41.42]My hand is up on my neck.
[70:45.05]Why is my hand on my neck?
[70:56.06]Pull it in.
[70:56.48]Dude, this part is just such a fucking mess.
[71:02.37]Alright, come on, man.
[71:03.51]Let's go.
[71:07.32]Somebody beat this game in four minutes, I'd like to meet that person.
[71:09.90]Because I'd be like, excuse me, sir.
[71:12.20]Why does your brain work in slow motion?
[71:14.77]You can see everything in slow motion.
[71:16.11]You know, actually, I have a theory.
[71:18.79]I have a theory that people that are really, really good at video games, let's say you're like really good at like Battlefield or something.
[71:23.61]Or you're like really good at fucking, oh, you know, I'm so good at like this MOBA.
[71:27.39]I have a theory that some people just see the world a like, like five tenths, like a two hundred tenths of a second faster than everybody else.
[71:36.98]Like you see the world in like a tenth of a second slow motion.
[71:41.26]That's why you can react faster than everybody else.
[71:45.87]Like, when I snap my fingers, I heard that right now.
[71:48.93]Like, you're hearing that right now.
[71:50.35]Some of you guys heard that be, like, even, like, a tenth of a second, a quarter of a third of a second faster than everybody else.
[71:59.38]Some people just can see the fucking world in, like, a little bit of slow motion.
[72:02.30]And that's how you become, like, a champion.
[72:07.25]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[72:09.15]Dude.
[72:14.67]Okay, I'm not fucking around anymore.
[72:16.05]Let's go.
[72:17.53]Let's do it.
[72:24.47]Told you.
[72:25.81]Told you I ain't fucking around anymore.
[72:36.60]Stop fucking around.
[72:38.44]Please.
[72:42.52]My whole body hurts.
[72:46.44]I can't believe I can't get up there.
[72:54.54]Back to basics.
[72:58.24]Back to basics.
[72:59.06]Come on.
[72:59.56]Here we go.
[73:09.36]No.
[73:11.27]God damn it!
[73:27.01]I tried to do something!
[73:28.93]Sorry about that.
[73:37.85]It's getting fucking impatient.
[73:40.01]Just completely impatient.
[73:41.69]It's like this... It's over.
[73:45.49]That's it.
[73:46.51]It's fucking over.
[73:48.54]This game's fucking impossible.
[73:49.82]What an impossible goddamn game.
[73:54.98]Now I'm just going down even further.
[73:57.40]Now I'm down even further.
[74:02.73]It's over.
[74:03.39]I've lost.
[74:03.77]I'm so annoyed right now.
[74:11.90]So there is...
[74:15.58]It's just getting off that, like, stupid slide, like, holy shit.
[74:18.34]Like, what percentage of people can actually do that reliably?
[74:22.60]Fucking two.
[74:23.74]There's two people that can do that reliably.
[74:32.07]Just cut my losses.
[74:32.87]I should have fucking got out at $500,000.
[74:34.09]I told you guys.
[74:34.47]Yeah.
[74:41.35]Yeah, here we are.
[74:43.17]Again.
[74:43.41]And all those extraordinarily difficult things I gotta do again.
[74:53.82]Fuck me, I was on a good roll there, and I just, I got up there once.
[74:58.34]And like, the boxes, the box bullshit.
[75:08.22]Fucking box bullshit is what it is.
[75:10.32]That's what it is.
[75:15.21]No, not quite.
[75:15.83]No, no, no, no.
[75:16.57]Easy.
[75:22.53]I'm so- It's over!
[75:23.81]I'm done!
[75:24.13]I- I've lost it all.
[75:28.91]All my, like, sense- Like, I- I didn't- I didn't make any of these mistakes the last time.
[75:36.26]I'm just so fucking frustrated.
[75:37.72]I need to take a second.
[75:44.50]You know what I mean?
[75:45.14]I need to, like, go throw water in my fucking face.
[75:51.27]Like, at least in Dark Souls, I can get a goddamn bonfire.
[76:07.64]Yikes.
[76:09.96]How close was I to the end of the game?
[76:11.66]What was that?
[76:12.10]Like, what was, like, the percentage to the end of the game?
[76:18.10]How far was that?
[76:21.82]Just like Dark Soul.
[76:23.87]Everyth- like- like 50%?
[76:26.91]Halfway?
[76:27.47]I can get there again.
[76:28.85]I just gotta- gotta slow the fuck down.
[76:30.45]Just slow the fuck down.
[76:49.13]Do you hear what I said?
[76:50.25]Slow down.
[76:53.35]You did this one before and it was so impressive when you did it that first time.
[76:57.01]Impress him again.
[76:58.63]Come on.
[77:00.09]Some of these people are gonna... Some of these people watching are gonna add you to their Christmas card list if you get this.
[77:10.18]Like, I want to be on that Christmas card list.
[77:13.60]Be like, hey man, I was watching your stream and holy shit, you got that first fucking try?
[77:17.67]Nice work.
[77:27.06]Get over here, come on.
[77:29.36]But the thing is though, I'm one of those people that doesn't take failure well.
[77:33.69]Like, me losing in this game, and then knowing what I have to do again, is enough for me to want to burn the copy of the game.
[77:39.89]You know what I mean?
[77:41.65]Like, right now, I want to go, like, knit a sweater.
[77:45.55]I don't want to do this again.
[77:57.55]I would rather go, like, take a nice long dump than do this again.
[78:05.67]You know what I'm saying?
[78:10.11]I gotta do this bullshit with the lanterns again.
[78:11.99]I gotta go through the fucking construction zone.
[78:13.80]Like, this is not ideal for me.
[78:18.52]This is not ideal.
[78:19.50]Oh.
[78:28.03]Because now I'm going to be here for another 30 minutes.
[78:29.65]Because I got lucky doing this last time.
[78:49.00]Almost.
[78:49.52]Almost.
[78:49.90]Almost.
[78:50.22]Almost.
[78:50.46]Almost.
[78:50.70]Almost.
[78:50.92]Almost.
[78:51.12]Almost.
[78:51.34]Almost.
[78:53.42]You got to come up through the... No.
[78:55.52]Like this.
[78:57.32]Ugh.
[79:00.87]There we go.
[79:01.27]Get up there.
[79:02.23]Straight down.
[79:03.13]Straight up.
[79:05.05]Oh, you stupid fucking asshole.
[79:07.03]Like, that was your fucking opportunity.
[79:10.03]That was the opportunity.
[79:11.07]My hands are fucking old.
[79:12.23]I have old man hands.
[79:13.91]I can't do it.
[79:18.40]I have this, like, arthritis riddled hands.
[79:20.94]And I can't, like, I can't do it.
[79:24.04]Don't have an age, guys.
[79:25.04]It sucks.
[79:27.68]Once you get past like 30, the world is over.
[79:31.56]You may as well just fucking not use your hands ever again.
[79:35.52]I'm gonna get arthritis.
[79:47.91]Get up there.
[79:48.53]Come on.
[79:50.37]God fucking damn it.
[79:56.55]Can't help it.
[79:57.95]I can't help it.
[80:00.09]I had a shot.
[80:00.94]I was not supposed to fall down at first.
[80:03.00]I'm not gonna pee now.
[80:07.32]You know, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get past this and I'm gonna go take a piss.
[80:10.64]I need to collect my thoughts.
[80:11.76]I'm so much further than this.
[80:17.42]There's so much more awful shit in the way that I have to do.
[80:25.03]Shut up.
[80:25.23]What's this guy's name?
[80:26.03]I want this guy's license plate.
[80:27.68]Get up there.
[80:28.84]Come on.
[80:49.70]I'm gonna go pee.
[80:50.38]I'm gonna go pee.
[80:51.00]Give me a break.
[80:52.00]Give me a break.
[80:52.50]Let me just take a quick break.
[80:54.20]We're gonna get through this.
[81:01.26]I need to get just up here.
[81:02.56]Okay.
[81:03.14]I'll be right back.
[81:04.91]I'm gonna go piss.
[81:06.01]Give me a break.

[81:11.39]Pee.
[82:45.43]Alright.
[82:47.99]And no, no face cam.
[82:49.79]No face cam.
[82:50.35]You know why?
[82:50.69]Because I'm wearing a bathing suit.
[82:52.93]And nothing else.
[82:54.77]There's a story.
[82:55.61]There's a story there.
[82:59.43]My dryer is broken.
[83:03.06]Okay?
[83:03.80]So I can't do laundry.
[83:04.90]I have to get my dryer vent fixed and my dryer fixed.
[83:08.98]So I don't have... I'm wearing a bathing suit.
[83:16.71]They should give you a 3-2-1 countdown when you hit resume.
[83:21.39]Yeah, I have no socks on.
[83:22.43]Just a bathing suit.
[83:24.01]No underwear.
[83:25.45]Bathing suit.
[83:26.09]No shirt.
[83:26.55]I might as well be at the beach.
[83:34.76]I'm gonna fucking... Here's what I'll promise you guys.
[83:38.16]I promise that I'll at least get to where I was before.
[83:40.07]And then I'm gonna take the half million dollars.
[83:47.08]I need to like... I gotta like move my chair or something.
[83:49.52]You know when you start getting uncomfortable?
[83:57.11]God.
[83:58.39]This shit is just the bane of my entire existence.
[84:01.99]Stop it!
[84:18.31]It's the bane of my whole existence.
[84:19.67]Trying to get through this stupid little lantern light way is causing me so many problems.
[84:25.77]It's like unbelievable.
[84:28.29]You know, it's so ridiculous, it's almost unbelievable.
[84:40.82]Oh my god.
[84:41.70]I'm about to lose my patience.
[84:48.31]Yeah, I'm losing patience.
[84:50.53]Patience is at like an eight percentile right now.
[84:56.77]Mmmmm.
[85:14.50]Come on.
[85:15.02]Fuck on.
[85:16.52]Get up there.
[85:17.08]I got angry.
[85:49.83]Fucking do it don't know I'm not gonna be one of those people like it's fucking angry at this game We're gonna go we're gonna get there again right fucking no Fucking record fucking time Oh
[86:17.59]Hey, you see this trick that I can do with my hand?
[86:20.85]Oh, goddammit.
[86:21.79]It's a... I don't know, man.
[86:23.25]I don't know.
[86:23.79]I fucked it up big time.
[86:25.05]I fucking ruined everything.
[86:27.54]I'm back at the very beginning of the fucking game.
[86:29.04]The very beginning of the game.
[86:31.62]It's just like... It's just one of those games where... This is one of those fucking games where this is just supposed to happen over and over again.
[86:40.20]And then eventually, you either get fucking fed up with the cheap game, the game that...
[86:51.03]I can get over there with one fucking swing.
[86:54.51]I'm like... I should have cashed the fuck out.
[86:57.81]Like, I should have cashed out.
[86:59.77]I would have been like, okay with that.
[87:03.22]You're supposed to get better.
[87:04.32]No, well, I don't get better.
[87:05.68]I just get angry and lose.
[87:08.96]Like, I start out good, and then I get angry and lose over and over again.
[87:17.83]Fucking believable.
[87:22.39]You're gonna see a rage quit, it's gonna happen.
[87:24.51]You think I'm gonna fucking get to the end of this goddamn game?
[87:30.57]Now I have to do this the entire fucking whole- I didn't know it was like that.
[87:35.46]I thought there was gonna be at least a little bit of leeway.
[87:40.14]My blood gets boiled so quickly that I may as well just fucking stream myself itching my asshole on camera.
[88:00.38]Like, it's 0 or 100.
[88:03.74]I'm one of those guys.
[88:05.16]I'm one of those 0 or 100.
[88:06.46]There's no in-between.
[88:08.58]I can't take a second and, like, think about what I'm doing.
[88:10.92]No, it's am I going 100 miles per hour or am I going 0?
[88:13.24]Am I at a stoplight or am I on the highway?
[88:16.25]I don't drive around in the fucking country.
[88:17.67]You know what I mean?
[88:18.09]I'm not a country town driver.
[88:31.47]And yet, even still, I can't stop it.
[88:33.55]I can't stop playing.
[88:39.47]Alright, we're okay.
[88:44.57]We're getting back to where we were.
[88:48.89]Just need to be fucking easy.
[88:55.16]Just pull it off.
[88:55.82]Perfect spot.
[88:56.84]Perfect spot.
[89:04.35]You fucked it up.
[89:05.33]You fucked it up.
[89:05.97]Step on the gas.
[89:06.68]Go on the highway again.
[89:07.46]Right here.
[89:28.19]Fucking god, dude.
[89:29.19]Oh my god.
[89:30.18]Oh my god.
[89:31.02]I can't I can't I'm so I'm just god
[89:37.37]God, my fucking like anger just has no, there's no boundaries anymore.
[89:41.65]I've lost it.
[89:42.23]I went out of bounds.
[89:43.15]I traveled with the ball.
[89:44.28]I grabbed the fucking basketball and just started running and not even dribbling.
[89:49.14]And I'm just, I didn't even go to the fucking hoop.
[89:52.14]I'm not even going to the hoop.
[89:53.44]I took the fucking basketball.
[89:55.24]The whistle blew traveling.
[89:56.70]I don't care.
[89:57.16]I'm running out of the fucking gym.
[89:59.67]And I'm still traveling.
[90:00.59]And then I get out of the gym, and I get the fucking front door in front of the goddamn, like, high school, whatever gym I'm in, and I just shot put the basketball as hard as I can.
[90:11.12]That's what just happened.
[90:12.42]That's what's been happening.
[90:17.42]I was so fucking far, and I was doing so good, and now, like, and that's after I hit, like, five three-pointers in that game.
[90:24.94]I got called for traveling for, like, nine minutes.
[90:28.20]Then I got benched.
[90:34.16]It's like, holy shit, wow, Jeremy did a really good job in today's game so far.
[90:37.44]He hit like five three-pointers in a row.
[90:40.82]What's he doing now?
[90:42.66]Why is he doing that?
[90:43.72]Why is he traveling?
[90:44.90]Where's he going?
[90:48.32]He's not, he's leaving the gym.
[90:50.96]He'll never play in this fucking town again.
[90:52.98]Oh my god, shut up.
[90:57.82]No, I'm not still on this part.
[90:59.62]I got like, fucking, I got to, ugh, I can't, you, you...
[91:03.82]I gotta type it, I can't even say it.
[91:14.20]I can't even say it.
[91:15.82]I gotta write it.
[91:26.62]Let's just take a minute here.
[91:33.89]What's like a relaxing thing?
[91:39.75]No, I have not been in the first area for like an hour and a half.
[91:42.51]That's not true.
[91:44.54]I traveled with the basketball and I went and I threw the basketball.
[91:48.46]We just talked about it.
[91:49.60]I was doing great.
[91:50.10]You know how many three-point shots I hit in this stream?
[91:56.82]A lot of them.
[92:06.44]God oh my fucking god The P actually you're not needing to piss made this harder Meaning to go to the bathroom like ruined my fucking game I'm gonna blame it on that let's play not on me like fucking to lose it and fucking up.
[92:29.93]No I
[92:34.17]In fact, I had to pee.
[92:35.67]That's what happened.
[92:37.18]And, like, I, for some reason, keep having trouble with this one.
[92:39.42]I feel like I need to do this.
[92:42.42]This was annoying to do it the first time, though.
[92:45.94]Oh my fucking god.
[92:47.85]I'm going to fucking punch a hole into my own face.
[93:10.73]I need to be easy.
[93:14.65]Don't go for the... I've already seen it before, so I know how to do it.
[93:17.49]But just do it the way... Now I know why everyone was like, you shouldn't play this game.
[93:24.96]But you know what?
[93:25.42]I'm going to go against everybody's wishes.
[93:26.98]I'm going to get at least a little bit further than where I am right now.
[93:37.65]If you start panicking, you start getting angry.
[93:40.75]Sometimes you gotta do a fucking secret move like that.
[93:46.24]I told you, there's only two speeds.
[93:49.54]I have 100 and I have 0.
[93:50.58]There's nothing else.
[93:53.16]I can't go 45.
[93:53.66]I can't do it.
[93:55.95]I can't go 45.
[93:59.21]I would love to go 45 right now.
[94:02.37]I can't.
[94:02.79]I'd like to just get in the car and I just lead foot the gas, even pulling out of a parking spot.
[94:09.85]You know what I mean?
[94:10.65]Like, oh, let's leave target.
[94:12.05]Let me get in the car.
[94:15.16]Stop on the fucking gas in reverse.
[94:17.28]And like I pull out and fucking pull it.
[94:20.28]There's no, I can't, I can't go in between.
[94:33.82]Get me the fuck over here, please.
[94:35.48]Before I lose my goddamn mind.
[94:46.56]Okay, different approach with this one.
[94:48.04]For real.
[94:52.76]I'm gonna go up.
[94:53.61]I'm gonna... I don't even fucking remember.
[94:55.73]I got like lucky doing this one.
[94:57.53]Like that.
[94:58.07]I just got fucking like lucky.
[94:59.17]You know what I mean?
[95:00.31]That was the luck.
[95:02.57]I'm gonna go buy a scratch ticket.
[95:08.77]Let's go buy a scratch off.
[95:12.04]And go win the goddamn Mega Millions.
[95:13.40]Alright, back, back.
[95:18.06]Here we go.
[95:20.06]I need, like, some neck support.
[95:21.14]I need to get, like, an airplane neck pillow.
[95:25.58]Because right now I'm, like, hunched over.
[95:27.00]I'm not comfortable.
[95:30.85]I need one of those neck pillows.
[95:33.88]In fact, I have one.
[95:34.72]I'm gonna go get it.
[95:41.88]Back to where we were.
[95:42.98]Back to the fucking original goddamn nightmare.
[95:48.31]Get on the rock.
[95:49.47]This is where I need to chill the fuck out.
[95:51.23]Did you hear what I said?
[95:52.75]Chill the fuck out.
[96:02.19]Okay.
[96:13.51]I gotta, like, just do, like, the chimney sweep thing.
[96:15.47]I have to sweep the broom on the ground.
[96:23.49]Is there a reason why I can't fucking do this anymore?
[96:29.84]No.
[96:30.16]Get on the fucking rock!
[96:32.92]Oh my fucking god.
[96:33.78]This- this- I would rather this part- I'd rather do this part- like the- the- the slide part a hundred times than do this part once.
[96:48.15]Okay, we're wedged in.
[96:49.14]Alright, I did it.
[96:58.58]I did it.
[96:59.20]Now we calm the fuck down.
[97:01.14]And I need to just relax.
[97:03.29]because we're back to this, like, spot here.
[97:05.63]Relax.
[97:10.49]You're seriously gonna do this to me now?
[97:13.91]You're not.
[97:14.53]Thank God.
[97:24.14]Not today.
[97:31.68]Not today.
[97:39.96]I'm making a cry face right now.
[97:42.82]That hurts so much.
[97:44.52]I'm fucking crying.
[97:50.82]Here we are.
[97:53.02]Oh.
[97:56.95]That was actually... I had that like, no!
[98:03.11]We're back to sort of where we were earlier.
[98:05.81]And by sort of, I mean not really at all.
[98:10.17]Don't you fucking care.
[98:17.65]This one is dangerous, because if you go too hard here, you so easily can just fucking ruin everything.
[98:24.28]I don't want to be known as the guy that ruined everything.
[98:36.00]He's still at this part.
[98:38.18]Don't you know how the game works?
[98:39.70]Don't you know how this game works?
[98:42.04]You fall down and everybody laughs at you.
[98:46.29]I'm done.
[98:47.37]Let's go.
[98:51.45]No, stop it.
[98:52.81]Stop that shit.
[98:58.00]I need to slow down, but I can't do it.
[99:03.10]Slow down.
[99:15.92]My hands are grease balls right now.
[99:19.62]I could paint with my hands.
[99:27.44]Get on the top of this stupid fucking fallout thing.
[99:32.28]Get in like shelter number seven or whatever the hell this is.
[99:46.96]You see like you see how easily I did this before and how much trouble I'm having with it now The vertical wall here has a weight How do I shut him up wait, where is it where is it That just got me killed I would have been so angry I
[100:13.23]I'm just rushing.
[100:14.09]I gotta stop rushing so much.
[100:15.97]Oh, you fucking dicky!
[100:30.90]Ugh!
[100:54.28]Oh, you fucking... God damn it!
[101:00.02]I can't... I can't... I can't do it.
[101:03.76]I can't do it.
[101:07.39]I'm sitting backstage right now before a fucking big part in a play.
[101:12.43]And I've rehearsed it a bunch of times.
[101:16.26]Like, I'm like... I'm like fucking Gaston in, like, Beauty and the Beast.
[101:23.10]And then my first scene is coming up.
[101:25.55]We've done the rehearsal a fucking hundred times.
[101:28.65]I know what I do.
[101:29.45]I come out and I flex three times.
[101:32.81]And I say, like... And that's how we do it here, folks!
[101:38.21]And I flex and everybody goes, Gaston!
[101:39.91]And we've practiced it a hundred fucking times.
[101:41.75]And it's showtime.
[101:42.49]It's show night.
[101:44.27]Ugh.
[101:45.31]And I fucking walk on that stage and I see all the lights.
[101:47.75]And I see all the people.
[101:48.66]I see all the hundreds of thousands of people in that fucking audience.
[101:52.70]And I walk out there and everyone's waiting for me to say my line.
[101:56.47]And I'm sitting there in my head fucking panicking like, I've said it a hundred fucking times.
[102:02.19]And now it's just, I... And then I fucking, my sweat is running down my ass crack.
[102:08.68]Everyone's like starting to laugh, like the fucking jocks in the back are laughing at me.
[102:12.90]And I know that I can see a couple of them.
[102:14.62]I can see Dylan up there from fucking homeroom.
[102:18.02]You know, and he's fucking laughing.
[102:19.20]He's like hitting his friends in the chest.
[102:20.54]Like, look at this fucking idiot.
[102:22.82]And I'm just like, I gotta remember my line quick.
[102:25.84]And I don't.
[102:30.24]And then I walk backstage and I fucking cry.
[102:33.97]And I say to myself, how the fuck did I let it get there?
[102:36.95]I've done this a hundred times.
[102:38.81]I was so confident in my fucking Gaston, and now I have no confidence.
[102:49.02]Can you please just get me up here, please?
[102:53.52]How did I do this last time?
[102:54.72]It's been so long that I fucking forget about it.
[102:58.45]You just kind of have to do it.
[103:04.80]I'm trying just to swing it around, but my... This fucking dumbass game.
[103:17.04]I did this so fucking easily last time that it's starting to drive me... You know, fuck the goddamn being nervous at the play.
[103:24.80]No, instead of I walk out and I just start screaming at the audience.
[103:33.46]I walk out of the... I was not nervous backstage.
[103:36.74]I'm ready.
[103:37.25]Here comes Gaston.
[103:38.67]Everyone's waiting for his line.
[103:39.85]And I just start pointing into the crowd going like, fuck you all for coming out here tonight.
[103:44.11]You understand?
[103:44.89]Global warming is a real threat.
[103:46.99]You're fucking doing nothing about it.
[103:48.81]And you back there, Dylan.
[103:50.45]I'm going to throw my fucking sandwich in your face tomorrow.
[103:52.92]And then you just leave.
[103:56.52]That's what's going on.
[103:57.62]That's not nervous.
[103:58.58]It's angry.
[104:16.02]Oh, my fucking god, man.
[104:18.02]Alright.
[104:19.22]It might be time for another break.
[104:20.74]Because, like, I am actually starting to get so angry that I can't do this.
[104:26.39]And I did it, like, in two tries last time.
[104:41.70]I swear to god.
[104:49.59]It's the red ink.
[104:51.23]I talk shit about the red ink and then it's coming back to get me.
[104:56.07]Play another game as a break?
[104:57.11]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[104:57.95]Let's see what I got.
[105:02.82]Oh, that was the one!
[105:06.10]That was the one.
[105:06.74]That was seriously the one.
[105:08.68]And the circle's bullshit.
[105:09.68]I'm trying to go, like, around wide.
[105:11.72]And it just, it does this little baby circle.
[105:16.47]Fuck the red ink.
[105:19.76]Yeah, I'm gonna come up from backstage and I'm just gonna whip, like, red ink into the crowd.
[105:25.35]What is this, like, Carrie?
[105:26.49]That... God fucking damn it, man.
[105:37.66]Blue ink is not the best ink.
[105:40.36]Don't ever say that in my presence.
[105:42.56]Oh.
[105:48.39]They're gonna laugh at you.
[105:52.29]Yeah, and like the jocks... We're gonna be here all fucking night.
[105:56.93]I'm gonna be here all day.
[105:57.78]I cannot concentrate.
[106:00.62]I was relaxed at the beginning of the stream, and it was easy to do.
[106:03.40]And the gas is pressed, and the gas is never being unpressed.
[106:13.66]Fucking blue ink.
[106:14.52]Yeah, and then guess what?
[106:15.32]Like, those jocks in the back?
[106:16.79]Their lettermans have, like, red ink.
[106:18.37]It's done in red ink.
[106:22.43]And they're holding up, like, black pens.
[106:24.17]Like, laughing, pointing at the black pen.
[106:28.33]Like, then pointing at me.
[106:29.79]And then they're taking out the ink cartridge.
[106:31.82]They're removing the ink cartridge and, like, well, look at this!
[106:34.10]Holding it in the air like they're shaking keys.
[106:35.78]And they drop it on the ground.
[106:37.04]And I'm just like, motherfucker!
[106:38.76]And they fill it with red ink cartridge.
[106:41.94]That's how you get me fucking going.
[106:43.26]Ah!
[106:46.62]How am I still at this part?
[106:47.98]I don't know.
[106:49.68]I was past it before.
[106:50.68]I was way past it before.
[106:51.92]But now I can't fucking do it to save my life.
[107:01.32]I got so tilted and so unhinged after falling that time.
[107:06.43]The simplest of motions is impossible to do.
[107:17.46]Like that one right there just gets me every single fucking time.
[107:32.91]It's like thundering outside right now.
[107:41.47]Why this part?
[107:42.61]Why this part?
[107:43.81]Why this fucking part?
[107:46.90]I'm
[107:48.14]I gotta... What game can I play to, like, relax?
[107:51.45]Just fuck this game.
[108:00.21]I got, like, so much more shit to do.
[108:01.51]You think I'm gonna be able to do it after failing at this part over and over again?
[108:13.28]Don't you dare.
[108:18.58]Holy fuck, you stupid fuck!
[108:20.82]No, I hit the goddamn ceiling!
[108:23.58]You hit it again!
[108:24.92]You did it again!
[108:25.54]You did it!
[108:43.23]What is this?
[108:49.37]Why are they playing this music now?
[108:57.01]Oh my fucking god.
[108:58.23]This was so easy the first fucking time.
[109:00.45]I did it first try.
[109:02.59]Shut up.
[109:04.17]Shut this fucking music off.
[109:43.24]How do I smash my own head with this hammer?
[109:48.44]God damn it.
[109:51.17]Do you see what I'm talking about now?
[109:53.39]Let me show you something.
[109:54.17]Let me show you something.
[109:54.97]I'm going to show you something really important.
[109:57.13]So, take a look at where my fucking axe is, right?
[110:00.49]For me to turn the music or volume down, watch what I have to do.
[110:03.80]Alright, let's move the music down.
[110:05.14]Okay, look where my mouse is right now.
[110:07.60]Resume.
[110:09.22]Do you see this shit?
[110:11.31]Why wouldn't you have like a countdown?
[110:13.26]Like 3, 2, 1 after hitting resume.
[110:16.64]My mouse is over there.
[110:21.68]What the fuck?
[110:24.02]Like, why?
[110:25.06]That seems so... That seems like such an oversight.
[110:43.72]Lost the gamer license.
[110:44.80]This is not a gamer license game.
[110:46.32]It's not.
[110:50.13]I got halfway through the game.
[110:52.29]I got to the half a million dollar question.
[110:56.91]Look, you know what?
[110:57.75]Here's my tagline.
[110:58.69]Jerma985.
[111:00.29]Better than most.
[111:02.52]Here you go.
[111:06.78]Jerma985.
[111:08.12]Better than most.
[111:17.33]It's all I care about.
[111:18.29]Don't need to be the best.
[111:20.13]Don't need to be bad.
[111:21.15]Better than most.
[111:23.60]What do you mean that's not true?
[111:38.48]See?
[111:39.10]Better than most.
[111:41.36]I'm okay with that.
[111:47.53]You don't gotta be the best.
[111:54.58]You just gotta get back to the fucking tunnel that you hate the most.
[112:03.70]And get stuck, like, for the next 30 minutes straight on this one part again.
[112:09.50]And then, you know, make sure the music's not on.
[112:19.78]Better than most.
[112:23.64]Oh, God.
[112:25.94]Some of these things, they just, my brain can't do them.
[112:30.44]Even though I know the solution, it don't matter.
[112:32.90]It's like being backstage at a play, right?
[112:35.50]And you've got your lines, and you know you've rehearsed.
[112:37.34]I'm just kidding, I'm not going to do that again.
[112:43.16]Get the fuck over there.
[112:50.65]Why?
[112:51.25]Why God must you do this?
[112:58.51]Why God must you do this to me?
[113:00.11]I'm not even that fucking... This stupid gigantic hammer.
[113:07.60]You don't have two hammers with you?
[113:09.66]How do you not have... Why wouldn't you have like a small hammer?
[113:18.06]Down where your crotch is.
[113:27.66]Oh my fucking god.
[113:29.18]Oh my god.
[113:31.08]I'm gonna watch like the Smurfs movie tonight.
[113:34.88]Just something that don't even matter.
[113:36.14]Like something so simple and basic like a child could enjoy it.
[113:39.55]I'm gonna watch the Smurfs fucking 3D movie.
[113:42.39]In 3D.
[113:50.10]I'm gonna get the 4K version.
[113:52.54]So I can just enjoy myself.
[113:54.56]Don't have to fucking worry about a goddamn thing.
[114:01.85]Oh, you are such a punk.
[114:05.20]Like it's in the worst possible spot.
[114:11.32]It's in the worst spot where I can't do it.
[114:20.67]I'll watch a Cars.
[114:23.51]What's a good movie where you can just turn your brain off and it doesn't even matter?
[114:26.19]Cars?
[114:26.99]Cars 2?
[114:27.25]What?
[114:31.31]What's the worst Cars movie?
[114:32.99]What's the one that was considered to be the shittiest one?
[114:53.62]Get down.
[114:55.22]Alright, we're good.
[114:58.34]Everything's fine.
[114:59.64]We're back where we were before.
[115:07.86]No, I gotta be out here.
[115:08.87]I'm not fucking this one up.
[115:12.35]Not gonna happen.
[115:15.89]I need to plant my stupid pottery pot down right in the edge.
[115:21.10]Right there.
[115:22.42]And then we're gonna go straight up and lock it.
[115:25.73]I'm gonna pull myself forward.
[115:33.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:37.75]No.

[115:52.19]Just lock it in there, please.
[115:53.39]I...
[116:05.34]The movement is just... I fucked it all up.
[116:08.38]You just gotta get it on there and move.
[116:16.77]Just let it go across.
[116:20.11]Pull yourself up.
[116:21.81]And then you have to shimmy it a little.
[116:27.41]Slow down.
[116:27.95]Alright, we're good.
[116:42.82]I don't know why I'm trying to go this fast.
[116:54.89]Perfect.
[116:55.89]Let go.
[116:59.35]We have made it back to where I was before.

[123:12.11]Bring back the narrator.
[123:13.33]I refuse.
[123:19.12]Skip the slide.
[123:19.86]What do you mean skip the slide?
[123:21.84]How do you skip the slide?
[123:28.44]Shortcut?
[123:30.92]Where is there a shortcut?
[123:31.80]I don't see a shortcut.
[123:42.19]Jump from the room I fell into.
[123:46.71]Straight up from the bathtub.
[123:50.67]Ah!
[123:52.17]Straight up from the bathtub?
[123:53.63]Are you serious?
[123:56.05]Have I been going this left this whole time for no reason?
[124:06.45]Oh shit!
[124:10.45]Oh my god.
[124:17.81]Hold on.
[124:21.71]Speedrun strat.
[124:23.09]Alright, let's give it a try.
[124:25.91]I don't think this is gonna happen.
[124:29.42]Can I do it from the satellite?
[124:30.74]No, I can't stand on the satatite.
[124:34.96]I gotta get up on here.
[124:39.00]Get on the sa- You can't get- Can you get on the satellite?
[124:44.28]Can you?
[124:44.62]I don't believe you can.
[124:46.20]Satellite, satellite, satellite.
[124:47.62]What do you mean satellite?
[124:48.50]Hold on, let me just noid it up.
[124:51.72]Let me just noid it up there.
[124:55.21]I can't sit on this.
[125:01.47]You can't sit on there.
[125:02.37]What are you guys talking about?
[125:04.13]I have to slingshot from here.
[125:07.04]Okay.
[125:08.46]I'll try it.
[125:09.44]I'll try anything once.
[125:11.50]You know, like super hot peppers or something.
[125:12.98]You know what I mean?
[125:13.86]Like, I'll try anything.
[125:14.78]One super hot pepper.
[125:19.44]One, two, three.
[125:31.65]Dude, I'll like eat a hot pepper on stream and be like, shut up.
[125:44.90]You guys don't even know.
[125:45.56]I'll eat a fucking... Dude, you guys don't even fucking know.
[125:49.22]I'm gonna eat like a wicked hot pepper on stream.
[125:52.06]And I'm gonna go... It's not gonna happen.
[126:04.77]I gotta go a long way.
[126:10.99]Not gonna happen.
[126:12.61]Yeah.
[126:14.07]I don't know how to do that reliably.
[126:15.75]We gotta go back to the fucking slide.
[126:16.87]That could have been very bad.
[126:25.86]I can't do it.
[126:28.50]That's an advanced movement.
[126:29.64]I told you.
[126:30.08]Better than most.
[126:37.56]Go on the right rail.
[126:39.60]What do you mean go on the right rail?
[126:43.87]I can stand on that?
[126:52.17]Oh my god.
[126:53.17]I swear to god.
[126:56.63]I fucking- I'm getting to that zone where I'm starting to get really fucking annoyed with doing this.
[127:05.18]The zone is- We're in the red zone.
[127:08.34]We're in the red ink zone.
[127:10.90]I'm sitting on the gold line.
[127:13.36]And the fucking other team has a first down and they need to go five yards.
[127:17.74]They score a touchdown.
[127:19.02]My mouse is going through my screen.
[127:21.31]I gotta have the defense play real well here.
[127:23.25]Seriously.
[127:35.83]Yay football.
[127:41.50]I'm still at this, yeah, I'm still at this point.
[127:43.52]I've fallen down like three times to the bottom of the ocean.
[127:55.55]No, no, no, it's all fucking done.
[128:02.59]I'll try bathtub strat again.
[128:06.62]So, you know, I'm gonna go check out the other shit over there.
[128:10.82]Like, I'm gonna try my own strategy.
[128:13.90]Fuck, like, the strategy that's supposed to work.
[128:15.45]Let's do the weird one.
[128:16.31]Let's do the one that I would do.
[128:18.25]You know, the fucking off-the-ball, off-the-wall one.
[128:21.13]That's the one I'm gonna go for.
[128:23.15]We're going this way.
[128:24.31]This is the kind of strategy that I would use.
[128:39.82]What's wrong with this?
[128:42.41]Okay, I can't go that way.
[128:43.73]I gotta go- I have to go this way, apparently.
[128:49.23]I gotta fling... I'll get it.
[129:00.20]I gotta do a huge fling here.
[129:08.78]Let's go this way.
[129:09.62]Let's get, like, attached.
[129:22.73]That would have been it.
[129:23.31]It was close.
[129:26.33]No, go the other way, man.
[129:34.72]Wait, fling to the right?
[129:35.86]You mean, like, over this way?
[129:37.10]That actually might be a good idea.
[129:41.60]Alright, let's try that.
[129:45.00]I'm gonna try doing a super... I'm gonna try doing a slingshot over here.
[129:53.82]I gotta be moving fast.
[129:55.14]So if I'm like here, it's gonna be like... Boink.
[130:04.49]This is definitely not faster.
[130:09.59]Well, there's no room for failure here.
[130:12.37]There's no room for failure.
[130:13.51]I can just keep doing this.
[130:15.29]Until I get it right.
[130:19.62]You can't lose this part.
[130:25.29]It's gotta be swing... I can't fail here.
[130:38.00]There's no losing.
[130:39.12]There's only a slingshot.
[130:41.08]I'll get it.
[130:41.44]I'll get it.
[130:41.90]One of these times.
[130:44.54]Because I can't lose.
[130:47.56]Can't lose.
[131:03.35]Alright, here we go.
[131:04.27]Time to get up there.
[131:05.43]One, two, three.
[131:19.08]We'll get up there eventually, guys.
[131:21.08]It's gonna happen.
[131:24.28]I'm playing with fucking a burning hot coal.
[131:30.77]Shit.
[131:43.68]Oh, that was close.
[131:48.05]I gotta just do it the right way.
[131:49.59]It's not gonna happen.
[131:53.47]Just go, you fucking idiot.
[131:55.19]Just get over there.
[131:56.05]Do it the right way.
[131:58.21]We'll be there all day.
[131:59.91]It's not gonna work like that.
[132:01.71]I have to do it this way.
[132:02.90]We gotta do it the correct way.
[132:04.16]The stupid fucking just rake.
[132:08.84]Just rake the leaves and I'll get there eventually.
[132:12.84]No, just calm down.
[132:13.82]Calm the fuck down.
[132:16.98]I need to go drink like a fucking hot chocolate or something, man.
[132:24.76]Here we are.
[132:25.52]Slow down.
[132:26.98]Line it up.
[132:30.10]Oh, you fucking stupid asshole game.
[132:33.02]It's just like a guessing game, if you can even hit that or not.
[132:37.66]It's just a goddamn guess.
[132:40.49]Don't move.
[132:57.76]Fucking hate this shit.
[132:59.80]I'm not going to the satellite jump again.
[133:02.27]I gotta just slow the fuck down and get this.
[133:04.51]Before I actually lose my real mind.
[133:12.98]Fucking god.
[133:14.76]Hold on a second.
[133:19.74]Hold on a second, guys.
[133:20.32]Let me wipe down my fucking water-covered hand.
[133:27.54]Fucking god damn it.
[133:28.44]I'm so angry.
[133:29.62]I haven't even lost yet and I'm so angry.
[133:35.19]I don't have any patience.
[133:36.21]I can't play this game.
[133:37.63]I have no patience.
[133:42.47]Guys, I barely have enough patience to order food from a drive-thru.
[133:45.40]If there's a guy in front of me that ordered more than three sandwiches, I'm angry at that person.
[133:51.16]You know what I'm saying?
[133:52.72]Drive-thru should be used for less than fucking five items.
[133:56.82]You got people go to the drive-thru, and they sit there and they order, like, six meals for people.
[134:02.42]It's like, you want to fucking, go inside.
[134:05.49]Go inside of the restaurant.
[134:07.49]I just want something quick.
[134:08.59]Drive-thru's supposed to be quick.
[134:11.98]I can't even handle the drive-thru.
[134:13.52]Let alone, like, this kind of game.
[134:31.14]There's only so much of this I can take.
[134:34.26]You're doing great, buddy.
[134:38.83]I fucking can't, man.
[134:41.15]I'm at that stage where it's just like a fucking... I'm just laughing about it.
[134:47.28]I'm just laughing about it.
[134:51.10]I'm so drained mentally.
[134:53.96]And I'm not even halfway through the fucking game.
[135:02.06]This shit happens to me all the time.
[135:03.56]I play a game that requires a lot of concentration.
[135:05.93]And then... And then, like, the whole world blends together.
[135:08.51]And I start to... I forget, like, the basic movements of the game.
[135:18.70]Stay here.
[135:24.60]Stay there.
[135:25.47]It's a slide, I know.
[135:39.38]Okay.
[135:40.58]We're going to get another solid attempt at this one.
[135:47.26]Sit on the beach ball.
[135:48.02]Wait, sweaty fucking hands.
[135:58.65]Don't like that angle.
[135:59.65]I didn't like the angle.
[136:03.05]Alright, let's play some... Fine, I'll play a song for you guys.
[136:05.62]I'm going to play an inspirational, like, educational song.
[136:09.32]When I was younger, this always used to fucking cheer me up.
[136:12.30]Like, honest to God.
[136:15.02]This is like my song that I would play.
[136:18.64]Like, I loved them.
[136:20.00]I thought they were so funny, and okay, so... This one's gonna make us all calm the fuck down.
[136:28.56]We're gonna learn something.
[136:29.48]We're gonna learn a thing or two.
[136:31.72]Here we go.
[136:32.02]Ladies and gentlemen...
[136:34.89]I'm going to... Sit down.
[136:35.95]I'm going to test your mental co... Sit down.
[136:37.51]I'm going to test your mental coordination with a little... Sit down.
[136:40.93]With a little number called... Swing in the alphabet.
[136:43.04]Okay, here we go.
[136:44.60]Right.
[136:46.40]I'll explain it so even you can understand.
[136:47.94]My colleagues will assist.
[136:49.54]Ready, sister?
[136:50.18]Ready.
[136:50.46]Get that junk out of here.
[136:51.16]Come on, boys.
[136:51.64]Scram.
[136:53.54]I'll give you the idea in a nutshell.
[136:55.56]B-A-B.
[136:56.68]B-E-B.
[136:58.00]B-I-B-I-B-O-B-I-B-I-B-O-B-I-B-I-B-O-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-I-
[137:25.54]Get the idea, girls?
[137:26.52]We'll all join together on the letter D. D-A-J, D-E-D, D-I-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-D-I-D-O-
[137:51.23]G-E-G.
[137:52.27]Come on.
[137:53.21]G-I-G-I-G-I-G-O-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I-G-I
[138:12.27]I beat the game!
[138:15.95]Alright, now it's starting to make me laugh.
[138:17.30]I gotta turn it off.
[138:18.44]Alright, I can't do it.
[138:23.06]I'm done.
[138:24.22]That got us through.
[138:24.82]That got us through the hard part.
[138:26.74]That's what I needed.
[138:27.22]Okay.
[138:32.10]Okay, we're good.
[138:33.02]Where's the game?
[138:34.44]Easy now.
[138:37.04]Yeah.
[138:38.69]Keck.
[138:43.44]Let's balance right here.
[138:49.69]That was the three stooges, how to learn the alphabet.
[138:57.51]How much longer is there?
[138:58.48]I don't know.
[139:00.40]But we've made it to a new horizon.
[139:04.98]There is a new horizon here.
[139:20.91]Okay, calm down.
[139:22.21]This is going to be difficult.
[139:27.33]I kind of want to cash out now, but I can't.
[139:29.11]I've got to sit the pot right here.
[139:36.72]I can't handle that storm wind chime.
[139:54.37]FART!
[139:58.51]What?
[139:59.76]I don't know why that was the word that I had to say.
[140:01.54]Like, fart?
[140:03.90]What a fucking, like, what an eight-year-old.
[140:13.87]Don't, you fucking, don't fail me now.
[140:18.95]Ugh.
[140:22.10]God damn it!
[140:23.84]Oh, fucking game.
[140:25.24]I'm done.
[140:25.64]That's it.
[140:25.98]Game over.
[140:27.04]It's done.
[140:27.48]I'm just gonna go until I get it.
[140:29.66]Here we go.
[140:30.00]I don't even care what happens now.
[140:31.62]I don't care.
[140:34.04]We're just fucking spamming.
[140:40.49]I'm fucking so upset about that shit.
[140:43.31]I was on top of there.
[140:44.27]I didn't even mean to fuck...
[140:51.03]Anyway, we're done.
[140:51.59]I'm done with this fucking game.
[140:55.15]Nope.
[141:24.06]Oh, my God.
[141:25.06]Damn it.
[141:25.88]God damn it.
[141:29.04]Now I know why everybody, like, was fucking screaming in, like, YouTube clips of this game.
[141:33.29]Now I understand.
[141:33.95]I understand why, like, I saw, like, a hundred Twitch clips of people screaming playing this game.
[141:39.61]Like, screaming and punching things.
[141:42.41]I get it now.
[141:51.98]I understand why people broke their fucking screens with this game.
[142:01.71]I'm falling down.
[142:02.24]I'm gonna just go until I fall one more time.
[142:03.82]And then I'm gonna play fucking like... I'm gonna go play like Putt-Putt's Adventure.
[142:19.00]It's such a simple concept, but it's so excruciating.
[142:23.15]This is excruciating.
[142:25.43]Oh, boy.
[142:26.49]B-A-B.
[142:27.81]Hold on.
[142:30.43]Get it.
[142:30.77]Come on.
[142:34.69]I'll give you the correct demonstration.
[142:36.62]PewDiePie pound those horse teeth.
[142:40.54]B-A-B-E-B-I-B-I-B-I-B-O-B-I-B-O-B-U-B-I-B-O-B.
[142:49.54]Get the idea, girls?
[142:51.74]Now we'll all join together on the letter D. Get all these bullets I'm blocking!
[143:20.49]I give up.
[143:21.23]I quit.
[143:47.66]I give up.
[143:49.86]Maybe I'll try another day.
[143:53.70]Maybe.
[143:55.25]I got to, like, halfway through the game.
[143:57.29]And then I got to the part where, like, you're missing it, so, you know, whatever.
[144:06.75]Holy shit, there are 4,000 people.
[144:08.27]Is this what you want to watch?
[144:09.27]There's fucking 4,000 people here.
[144:17.94]I didn't even look at the viewer count.
[144:19.10]I looked down and was like, holy shit.
[144:23.44]God damn it.
[144:25.46]Alright, hold on.
[144:25.92]I need to take like a fucking calm down break.
[144:29.64]Hold on.
[144:31.02]What do I have on here that I could play just to relax for five minutes?
[144:34.49]What do I got?
[144:42.45]Don't stress yourself.
[144:45.43]We're just a ball of stress.
[144:51.96]Unmute the narrator.
[144:54.44]Oh, I got so far and I just... It's just too much.
[144:59.46]That's a really fun game, but oh my god, is it draining.
[145:04.70]Do I have putt-putt?
[145:07.20]Nope.
[145:09.12]And I made the stupid joke to get all the way back down here too.
[145:11.81]Nope.
[145:13.21]No, I gotta play something else.
[145:14.39]I've been playing this for like two and a half hours.
[145:17.57]I don't think my body can handle it.
[145:21.07]Not right now.
[145:24.39]I got so far.
[145:25.23]Yeah.
[145:26.17]That's going to be it for this.
[145:27.21]I can't even look at it right now.
[145:28.50]It's like angering me even seeing this guy's fucking arms.
[145:30.66]Alright, is Putt-Putt on Steam?
[145:32.68]We're going to end the stream by playing Putt-Putt for like 12 minutes.
[145:41.32]I don't think Putt-Putt's even on Steam.
[145:45.77]God damn it.
[145:47.17]Did I get far?
[145:47.73]How far?
[145:48.29]Be real with me.
[145:48.81]Be realistic with me.
[145:50.07]Did I get far enough in that game to get a high five?
[145:54.51]Yeah.
[146:00.97]Holy shit, it really is.
[146:03.37]They're all on here.
[146:06.61]Do I get like a high five?
[146:07.39]Alright, Putt-Putt saves the zoo.
[146:08.85]We're gonna do this for 20 minutes.
[146:11.41]Every Putt-Putt.
[146:12.07]Okay, but Putt-Putt joins the circus.
[146:15.05]Putt-Putt joins the parade.
[146:18.33]Okay, hold on.
[146:18.95]Give me a second.
[146:20.27]I'll be right back in one second.
[146:21.39]This is important.
[148:29.05]Okay, here.
[148:29.61]Here you go.
[148:29.87]Go ahead and vote on this.
[148:34.85]You gotta pick the right one.
[148:35.65]I mean, this is a very important poll.
[148:41.46]Make sure you pick the right one.
[148:44.04]So, like, there you go.
[148:44.96]This is every fucking single putt-putt.
[148:46.80]Which one are we gonna play?
[148:48.14]And now I'm gonna go take a piss.
[148:50.40]I'll be right back.
[148:50.96]Here.
[148:51.18]There you go.
[148:51.72]There it is for everybody that can't see.
[148:53.18]There.
[148:55.08]I'll be right back.
[150:31.30]Have we made a decision?
[150:32.48]Let's see.
[150:35.10]Looks like... There's so many entries here.
[150:38.72]Okay, we got... Putt-Putt goes to the moon.
[150:42.69]Putt-Putt travels through time.
[150:45.37]So it looks like Putt-Putt travels through time is the Putt-Putt that we're going to play.
[150:50.25]Are we done?
[150:52.01]It's your last chance.
[150:53.45]You got like another 45 seconds.
[150:57.77]Where's the zoo option?
[151:03.95]Papa saves the zoo.
[151:06.47]I didn't put that one on there.
[151:07.77]That one sucks.
[151:08.33]Who cares?
[151:11.27]Zoo isn't an option.
[151:12.11]I ain't redoing the whole poll to put the zoo on here.
[151:15.73]Fuck the zoo.
[151:16.29]Alright, here we go.
[151:24.81]Oh boy.
[151:25.33]I didn't look at bits.
[151:26.15]I was so frustrated with that game.
[151:28.27]Holy shit.
[151:29.13]Okay.
[151:30.97]I should have read these.
[151:33.56]Don't worry, I'll hit them all up at the end of the stream.
[151:36.72]I will read all the bits that I missed previously, but... Right now, Ben Elnor, with a hundred bucks.
[151:42.83]Ben, thank you for the hundred dollars.
[151:44.97]I hope you enjoy this next part of the stream.
[151:47.11]Welcome back, my friend.
[151:49.77]Thank you so much for the hundred fucking dollars.
[151:52.71]This one goes out to you, buddy.
[151:54.61]Because we're going to play Putt-Putt Goes to the... What are we doing?
[151:57.83]Which one?
[151:59.79]Putt-Putt Travels Through Time.
[152:00.99]Okay, it's over.
[152:01.71]It's done.
[152:02.07]We're playing Putt-Putt Travels Through Time.
[152:03.59]1997.
[152:04.13]Fuck the zoo.
[152:08.11]Alright, Putt-Putt Travels Through Time.
[152:12.15]First, let me just buy it.
[152:13.67]Because I don't have it.
[152:16.64]Alright, let's go.
[152:17.46]Putt-Putt Travels Through Time.
[152:21.24]Add to cart.
[152:22.52]Buy it.
[152:24.48]I hope I can capture this game.
[152:27.37]And the zoo?
[152:28.17]Fine, you know what?
[152:28.87]Let's buy the zoo too.
[152:30.67]And you know what?
[152:31.58]Because I'm fucking an intelligent person, we're gonna play them both at the same time.
[152:36.12]You know, I'm gonna just play them both together.
[152:37.84]Because we'll appease everybody's... It's a child's game.
[152:42.64]So, we'll do them both.
[152:43.62]We're gonna play them both at the same time.
[152:45.38]If it's possible.
[152:46.40]I don't know if it's possible.
[152:47.40]I probably shouldn't have just said that.
[152:51.19]I probably should not have just said that.
[152:53.19]Because I'm not sure I can play them both at the same time.
[152:55.95]Because it's an old fucking game.
[152:59.32]Let's see.
[152:59.54]You're going to have to give me a minute here, though.
[153:00.68]We'll just talk while we hang out and just talk about Putt-Putt.
[153:06.84]Zumbinis was a children's game and I couldn't do it.
[153:08.78]But no, this is a literal game for a seven-year-old.
[153:14.16]Let's see if I can run these in a window.
[153:15.52]Because if I can, we're going to play them both at the same time.
[153:17.23]I'm going to start 3, 2, 1 and see how far we can get.
[153:20.25]Installing them right now.
[153:22.91]Let me just open my DXWND.
[153:25.65]Hopefully I can actually do this.
[153:28.94]I'm going to mute the desktop audio just so you guys don't get your eardrums blown out because these are old games and we all know what happens with old games.
[153:35.32]They're unbearable.
[153:36.38]They're loud.
[153:40.36]Don't be dumber than a seven-year-old.
[153:41.56]I'm not going to be dumber than a seven-year-old.
[153:42.80]All right, let's open it.
[153:45.24]Let's see what happens.
[153:47.82]Can't I just stick it into a window?
[153:49.74]And hey, look at that.
[153:50.90]Yes, I can.
[153:51.50]Let's open them both.
[153:55.94]I got to get them both ready.
[154:00.86]Okay, hold on.
[154:03.48]This audio has to get dropped like crazy.
[154:06.00]Alright, we got this one.
[154:14.57]This is going to be so hard.
[154:15.87]This is going to be obnoxious.
[154:21.69]This is going to be so obnoxious.
[154:23.02]I don't even know what's going on.
[154:24.78]You want to hear this?
[154:27.84]I told you it's loud.
[154:29.34]It's really loud.
[154:31.12]What is the fucking message?
[154:32.98]There it is, okay.
[154:34.12]Good morning, Mr. Baldini.
[154:36.15]Today's the opening of the Car Town Zoo.
[154:38.83]I know, but it's a bigger day.
[154:40.47]We can only get audio from one at a time.
[154:57.27]So give me a moment.
[154:58.07]Hold on.
[154:59.83]We're missing the opening.
[155:05.79]I'm going to have to restart them.
[155:06.79]We're missing the opening cutscenes here.
[155:09.81]Okay, window.
[155:11.84]Window capture.
[155:14.28]Okay, look, it's Twitch chat.
[155:16.56]That's not what we were looking to see.
[155:17.88]There's this one.
[155:18.64]Okay.
[155:20.00]There's one.
[155:20.50]And here's two.
[155:28.21]Okay.
[155:29.37]Make sure you can see it well, so it's not all blown out.
[155:39.70]Like this.
[155:40.80]And then I'm gonna, down here I'm gonna write something fucking clever.
[155:47.50]Let's, uh, let's write, like, uh, text.
[155:54.33]Double, like, double pipe.
[155:55.39]I don't know.
[155:55.97]Wait.
[155:58.40]Let's call it what this is.
[156:02.28]Is it two Ps?
[156:05.88]Is putt-putt two Ps?
[156:06.86]I'm going to put this on the top.
[156:13.99]Double putt speedrun.
[156:15.57]Should I give like a fake website too?
[156:24.02]Like my website?
[156:28.08]Alright, so we got that.
[156:28.84]We got double putt speedrun.
[156:29.84]Let's change the title.
[156:33.12]Give me a sec.
[156:36.80]This is going to be called double putt speedrun.
[156:40.54]I'm going to write like, what is it?
[156:44.50]Age, sex, ASL?
[156:45.90]Age, sex, location?
[156:46.80]What do they do?
[156:47.44]Any percent?
[156:47.94]Any percent.
[156:52.36]No, I don't know.
[156:53.67]Double putt speedrun.
[156:55.31]Putt, putt.
[156:58.92]Saves the zoo.
[157:00.18]Don't even matter.
[157:01.12]Putt, putt.
[157:05.06]Putt, putt.
[157:05.66]I don't think they... That game's not even on here.

[158:56.36]It needs to be a moving clock.
[159:04.70]Does this one move?

[165:44.69]Okay, exit.
[165:47.99]I can get that with the rope.

[166:58.74]Wrong food.
[167:00.12]I blew it.
[167:02.49]He's not going to eat it.
[167:07.04]That's not what a penguin looks like.
[167:09.14]Animal number two.
[167:12.32]Something on that I don't like.
[167:17.68]That's not correct.
[167:19.81]That's kind of correct.
[167:21.27]That's pretty close.
[167:23.87]No.
[167:25.83]I think it was that one.
[167:27.51]No, it wasn't.
[167:28.65]Where can she...
[167:32.27]Just ride around and take photos, everybody.
[167:37.79]It's not what I ordered.
[167:38.67]What the fuck is this?
[167:42.87]Missed a split.
[167:46.85]I got two pictures of the animals so far.
[167:48.47]That's all I need.
[167:50.83]This one, I'm just like seeing the sights and drinking hot cocoa.
[167:57.28]Oh.
[167:59.65]Alright, that was right.
[168:00.13]That was correct, right?
[168:00.97]Now I get like a star.
[168:02.23]I get a moon.
[168:03.67]How come I don't get a moon?
[168:05.43]Ah, shit.
[168:05.84]My fucking timer's off.
[168:07.50]Alright, well, apparently that didn't do anything.
[168:15.86]Where can she be?
[168:17.04]I'm gonna go over here.
[168:25.18]I need, I need, wait, there's a monkey here now.
[168:26.74]What?
[168:27.22]Why is there a monkey here?
[168:31.78]Okay, good.
[168:32.26]Keep going.
[168:33.44]I don't understand this.
[168:35.84]I made the right foo, didn't I?
[168:40.16]Why am I an idiot?
[168:41.34]That was a penguin.
[168:45.93]It's pretty much Garfield.
[168:47.77]That is Garfield.
[168:50.61]That's not right.
[168:51.37]That's not right.
[168:52.01]Hold on.
[168:52.33]There's the monkey's face.
[168:54.79]The legs were wrong?
[168:56.05]No, they were... Oh, fuck me.
[168:57.59]We'll get back to it.
[168:59.55]What do I need to do here?
[169:02.98]We need to choose a color first.
[169:04.86]Choose a color for what?
[169:06.52]This shovel might come in handy.
[169:08.28]I... Okay, there's the monkey body.
[169:12.70]No, that's not right.
[169:13.62]That's not right.
[169:14.20]We need the monkey's body.
[169:17.46]The monkey's not wearing a suit.
[169:21.56]I missed the cycle.
[169:22.60]Oh, shit.
[169:23.68]There we go.
[169:24.36]Pet food.
[169:24.86]Eat it.
[169:26.78]What color?
[169:28.71]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say like green.
[169:30.23]I look good.
[169:34.64]Green.
[169:37.16]Give him that food.
[169:39.48]Use the shovel on the snow.
[169:42.64]Green paint.
[169:44.32]Gotta give this to an alligator.
[169:48.38]Wait, what?
[169:48.92]Why did I do that?
[169:50.92]Why am I doing this?
[169:52.50]What is he doing over here?
[169:53.80]He's smashing it into a space.
[169:54.96]Alright, what do I got?
[169:56.58]Oh, now I got a cat.
[170:00.20]How did I fuck that up before?
[170:05.47]Don't tell me I have to sit here and do this the whole time.
[170:11.38]I'm glad we have two games open.
[170:16.60]You know, I almost just pressed the button when it was on the penguin.
[170:19.12]Here we go.
[170:22.00]I'm now green.
[170:22.90]I've got the mirror.
[170:25.42]Okay, good.
[170:26.84]We can just leave.
[170:30.88]Let's go back to the snow level.
[170:34.48]Feed the cat.
[170:38.98]It's a mini game?
[170:39.86]What do you mean it's a mini game?
[170:41.79]Use the rope.
[170:42.51]No, I gotta go, I gotta use the shovel and the snow.
[170:48.47]And then it's gonna change to like a dinosaur or something.
[170:50.47]Alright, what destination point?
[170:55.49]What kind of animal is that?
[170:56.37]That's not a, that's not a real animal.
[171:02.68]A duck monkey.
[171:05.46]Alright, that's fine.
[171:09.18]Pretty nice customizable avatar.
[171:12.40]There we go.
[171:14.95]One more.
[171:16.03]There it is.
[171:17.07]No, one more.
[171:19.01]Okay.
[171:22.07]How long does this happen for?
[171:23.19]Alright, watering hole.
[171:27.07]Get a camera out.
[171:27.65]Take a picture of the peacocks.
[171:30.13]Look at that!
[171:37.26]I'm taking some pretty good photos.
[171:38.46]Alright, when do I get my- you've completed the elephant- Jumbo?
[171:44.00]I should save my film for taking pictures of the zoo animal.
[171:47.30]That is a zoo animal.
[171:47.96]Oh, Jumbo!
[171:49.02]Yep, okay.
[171:53.17]God damn it!
[171:53.85]What the fuck?
[171:54.31]I don't want to do this anymore.
[171:55.23]Are we gonna- We're gonna get a Dodo bird, okay.
[171:58.03]Nice, like, Myspace angle.
[172:11.36]There we go.
[172:12.10]Make the food.
[172:12.58]Is this what hell is like?
[172:19.22]Another animal.
[172:19.82]You're in trouble.
[172:20.40]Take a photo.
[172:26.34]When you accidentally open the front camera.
[172:28.47]This is bad.
[172:29.23]I don't like this.
[172:30.59]I gotta rescue Sammy Seal.
[172:33.51]You don't need to hear the cutscene.
[172:36.01]It's okay.
[172:41.80]Oh my god, what?
[172:43.78]Do I not have to do this?
[172:44.96]Get me the fuck out of here.
[172:46.26]Just gonna keep doing like mutant animals.
[172:51.54]I already know.
[172:52.04]Let's figure it out.
[172:52.80]I already know what to do.
[172:54.02]Just let me get access to it.
[172:57.02]Give me access, come on.
[172:58.02]Come on.
[173:10.57]I don't think I can open the dam.
[173:12.06]I don't think I can open the I don't think I can open the I need to find something to help me lower the dam.
[173:18.00]I thought I just exited my fucking stream client.
[173:20.10]No, it's chat.
[173:21.20]I just like spam clicked.
[173:22.16]I thought I just hit exit on OBS.
[173:25.09]Hold on.
[173:32.59]I can't wait to go home.
[173:37.28]Alright, alright.
[173:38.22]So, we've taken a little break here.
[173:41.18]So, we're okay.
[173:41.86]We've taken a break.
[173:44.84]I think it's time to add another game.
[173:48.36]I can't wait to go home!
[174:06.38]I can't wait to go home this up there use that get this in the right spot let me know if I can help you okay so uh I'm gonna make this a little bit smaller put this in a window if I can without that full screen

[174:41.54]That's good.
[174:42.92]Apply that shit.
[174:44.23]Get that down here.
[174:45.07]I feel like this... You know what?
[174:52.83]I'm going to fucking beat this with this stupid fucking setup.
[174:55.43]I swear to God.
[174:56.66]I can't wait to go home.
[175:04.96]Why is this even on here still?
[175:08.90]No, this has got to go.
[175:10.52]No, it can't.
[175:11.92]It has to stay, right?
[175:14.53]I wonder how we can lower the dam.
[175:16.85]I'm going to make this a different color.
[175:23.99]Color.
[175:24.57]Select color.
[175:28.54]This is going to be like yellow.
[175:29.98]So you can see it.
[175:32.45]I wonder how we can lower the dam.
[175:36.59]Put on unregistered hypercam.
[175:38.96]No.
[175:43.62]It's gonna be Comic Sans though, that's for sure.
[175:49.26]I wonder how we can lower the dam.
[175:55.02]You can't even like fucking make that text out.
[175:56.80]I don't even care.
[176:00.47]Alright, here we go.
[176:03.04]Three, two, one, and action.
[176:07.00]Nope.
[176:08.32]I can't wait to go home.
[176:09.82]Hmm.
[176:23.09]Let me know if I can help you.
[176:24.69]I miss my mommy and daddy.
[176:27.75]We'll get that damn open, Sammy.
[176:31.17]Excuse me, I'm Putt-Putt.
[176:33.61]I'm visiting from the past.
[176:35.81]I thought this was a library.
[176:37.79]Where's all your books?
[176:39.29]My, my, you are from the past, aren't you?
[176:41.87]Nowadays, all books can be found on our computer.
[176:45.47]Usually, when you find what you're looking for, I can make a copy for you.
[176:49.36]But unfortunately, at the moment... I...
[176:52.88]Go.
[176:57.57]Get that damn open.
[176:58.55]I don't know how.
[176:59.23]I don't know how to do that.
[177:01.87]I took a picture of these guys.
[177:04.61]What does this guy have to do?
[177:09.07]Wow.
[177:10.41]I can see all of the grassland.
[177:13.60]It's beautiful.
[177:24.60]Slow down.
[177:28.18]Rope the dam?
[177:28.74]I just tried to rope the dam, but it didn't do anything.
[177:35.57]The music is making this hard for me to do anything.
[177:40.05]Why?!
[177:40.83]God fucking dammit!
[177:42.51]Get back here!
[178:02.34]When that cutscene's over, I can move.
[178:07.33]Go that way.
[178:15.86]Yep.
[178:16.26]You go over here.
[178:16.78]I don't care.
[178:20.08]Just take a fucking photo.
[178:23.68]Smile!
[178:32.45]Shit.
[178:32.99]Slow down.
[178:33.85]Right here.
[178:34.81]Turn the corner.
[178:38.85]I gotta go a little bit higher.
[178:40.14]Once I get past this, I can go on to the other game.
[178:45.58]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[178:46.64]Go.
[178:48.08]What are you... What are you doing?
[178:49.62]What are you doing?
[178:50.74]What are you doing?
[178:59.07]I've like... I don't even remember how to...
[179:09.97]Burritos!
[179:15.35]I don't even know the nuances of this fucking game anymore.
[179:43.60]The fuck over here.
[179:44.20]Come on.
[179:45.20]I got it this time.
[179:49.14]Why can I not move the... Why can't... Where the... I can't move the fucking screen.
[179:53.14]Oh my god.
[179:54.08]I can't... I can't even see what I'm doing.
[179:56.69]I need to use OBS to see what I'm doing.
[179:58.89]Full screen.
[179:59.89]I can't even select it.
[180:02.21]Oh for the love of fucking god in heaven.
[180:04.17]Why?
[180:04.39]Why?
[180:09.11]Full screen.
[180:11.04]Resume.
[180:13.08]I'll get it.
[180:13.76]I got the insanity sucked out of my body.
[180:16.18]You know what I mean?
[180:24.26]Now this whole thing's gotta get... I've been trying to reset... Oh my fucking god, you stupid motherfucker.
[180:32.58]I'm ready now.
[180:33.86]We had our fucking moment of nonsense.
[180:36.80]I'm gonna go back to this game and I'm gonna take it slow and we're gonna win.
[180:41.37]Sometimes you need to just run your brain through the ringer.
[180:47.69]One last try.
[180:52.79]The seal, the seal's gonna freeze to death in that water.
[180:54.83]You know, I'm just gonna be real with you guys.
[180:56.07]All right, well, I just accidentally pressed mark echoes getting up.
[181:06.19]Content's under pressure.
[181:07.63]That's not the name of this game.
[181:13.37]What the fuck is that game now?
[181:15.29]I want to play that game.
[181:17.29]What is that game?
[181:20.55]I'm trying to change the name of the game All right, let's go let's play it nice and easy here.
[181:28.00]I'll get I'll get back to where we were and we'll try it again Nice and easy last try
[181:42.77]We're going to give this one good solid attempt.
[181:45.98]And then I'm going to go get food.
[181:50.22]It's actually a good game.
[181:54.00]Mark Echo is getting over it.
[181:57.13]Is this Mark Echo right here?
[181:58.65]Okay, so that's how you get screwed by the cup.
[182:03.39]I get you.
[182:15.09]Okay, let's do this nice and easy.
[182:22.17]Get in there.
[182:30.37]Doing good so far.
[182:31.85]I don't have the rage of the last stream.
[182:34.57]Because this is another stream.
[182:37.91]We're playing as a different stream.
[182:39.37]I just streamed Putt-Putt.
[182:42.71]That was another stream.
[182:45.66]Now I can relax and get to where I was before.
[182:47.52]Or at least try.
[182:53.23]Bring back Putt-Putt.
[182:55.09]You don't honestly want me to play Putt-Putt, right?
[182:56.89]I mean, come on.
[183:00.75]I'm not gonna play Putt-Putt.
[183:02.49]That was a good, like, eight-minute joke.
[183:07.43]But it prepared me.
[183:09.55]It prepared me to, like, get this shit done.
[183:18.90]Because now I'm relaxed.
[183:20.74]I saw a child's cartoon.
[183:22.08]I'm in my pajamas.
[183:28.74]It's Sunday night, 10 o'clock.
[183:31.08]Eastern time.
[183:31.72]I'm just going to act like no one's watching.
[183:35.40]What do they say?
[183:35.98]Just imagine the audience is naked.
[183:37.16]Is that what you're supposed to do?
[183:41.24]Make a school play.
[183:41.92]Want to bring that school play shit back again?
[183:45.44]Me falling down gets old after a few tries.
[183:48.70]Well, don't worry, because if it happens again, that's going to be the last you see of this.
[183:53.46]I can fucking guarantee you that.
[183:54.84]You know what?
[184:02.63]This game throws me off, because the sound sounds like somebody threw fucking coins in a dryer.
[184:09.97]You know, you guys know that sound I'm talking about.
[184:11.44]That ear-grating, awful sound.
[184:14.14]When somebody leaves loose change in their pockets.
[184:20.05]It's a huge pet peeve of mine.
[184:21.29]Empty your pockets before you put shit in the laundry.
[184:35.01]Oh, you dirty little... Putt-putt saves the laundry.
[184:44.38]Putt...
[184:55.23]now no it's just got me now it's got me it's got me by the balls it has me by the balls okay the best attempt was the first try that was when I was ready to go I had a coffee and now like I need to go like I got like almost halfway through the game like on the first attempt and all of a sudden I cannot I cannot get myself out of a paper bag
[185:29.03]Why am I so addicted to this fucking dumb game?
[185:32.57]I can't help it.
[185:44.72]Get the fuck up here.
[185:47.18]Oh my god.
[185:48.42]Why on earth must you do this shit to me every time?
[185:53.13]Why?
[185:54.17]Why do you have to make this so hard to do?
[185:56.85]Why can't you make it like, why can't you just make this putt-putt?
[186:00.89]I'd rather play a game where you rake leaves, not like fucking do this shit.
[186:12.52]Oh my god, I'm gonna squeeze an orange in my own mouth and fucking, that's how I'm gonna drink orange juice tomorrow morning.
[186:20.34]It's an allegory for life.
[186:22.46]No, it's not.
[186:24.22]It's a guy in a fucking pot with a sledgehammer trying to climb a mountain.
[186:41.09]We made it.
[186:42.61]Kind of.
[186:54.81]Back up to where we were.
[186:56.55]Last solid attempt.
[187:04.99]You fucking piece of crap.
[187:06.39]Like, you stupid piece of crap.
[187:16.84]Oh, it's something about this game, man.
[187:19.02]It is infuriating.
[187:23.42]He's still here.
[187:24.52]Shut up.
[187:26.20]I know exactly what you're doing here.
[187:28.38]I know the joke you're saying is like he's still here, even though I'm not still here.
[187:34.17]Cut it out.
[187:36.71]Cut it out.
[187:37.77]It's not... Cut it out, alright?
[187:44.93]Back to putt-putt.
[187:45.89]No.
[187:46.47]Nope.
[187:47.17]I'm going to get to... I have to get to at least where I was before.
[187:49.35]And then I'm going to turn off the stream.
[187:51.35]And I'm going to go... I'm going to just go depressed eat.
[187:56.26]I'm going to shove food so fast down my throat.
[187:58.72]It doesn't even have time to get down to my stomach.
[188:02.94]Crying.
[188:04.03]I'm going to scream crying.
[188:12.91]I'm not going all the way with this game.
[188:14.13]Unless I get it right now.
[188:20.41]Yaiyadius fucking me.
[188:21.75]Oh my god.
[188:22.51]I can guarantee you you're never going to fucking see this game ever again on this channel.
[188:32.29]I can guarantee you 100%.
[188:33.86]You will never see me play this game again.
[188:36.56]Ever.
[188:37.76]Honest to god.
[188:38.64]The developer of the game could call my cell phone right now.
[188:42.43]and say, hey, Jeremy, look, we really liked when you played that game that we made.
[188:47.41]You know, the one with the fucking guy that sits in the pot with a sledgehammer?
[188:49.87]Yeah, it was great.
[188:51.31]We'll give you $25,000 if you play it again for five minutes.
[188:54.99]I'm going to scream, nope, and hang the phone up.
[189:18.69]I'm not gonna fucking play this game tomorrow.
[189:21.07]No.
[189:27.49]That's like one and a half Bitcoin though.
[189:30.18]No, I'm not in the mood for Bitcoin right now.
[189:32.62]I'm not in the mood for Bitcoin jokes.
[189:34.14]I'm in the mood to get up the fucking side.
[189:35.76]Because I've gone like so much fucking further than this stupid part of the game.
[189:44.20]Like, it's... You've seen me beat this like five times.
[189:55.87]Stupid fucking pile of garbage stupid fucking game Some guy had a fucking ID he played like a shitty flash game like ten years ago was like, you know I'm gonna remake that and make people hate themselves He even narrates it he narrates how much he hates us all he hates all of us.
[190:14.36]He doesn't like any of us.
[190:15.20]I
[190:17.32]He made this game to make sure that you and I all fucking hate ourselves.
[190:20.68]That's why he made this game.
[190:24.44]He even says it on the back of the fucking box art.
[190:27.67]Ay-yay-yay!
[190:44.18]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[190:48.30]I need to fucking, I need to go.
[190:49.68]I gotta go.
[190:51.64]I gotta go.
[190:52.70]I'm gonna go.
[190:54.24]Hey, I think, I think I'm gonna pop off here.
[190:56.45]I think I'm gonna pop off.
[190:57.53]I'm gonna go pop off and then go pop my head off.
[191:00.45]I'm gonna go like, I'm gonna squeeze my head like a fucking dandelion and.
[191:02.83]Watch the juices come out.
[191:09.20]I'm gonna pop my head off like a dandelion.
[191:17.00]I just gotta slow down.
[191:18.14]It's so hard.
[191:23.44]It's just so difficult to turn your brain off and make yourself climb these tiny little fucking cracks.
[191:40.26]See, like that one right there, the stoop is like an NES cartridge that sticks out.
[191:45.58]And again, like, we'll be here for another 40 fucking minutes.
[191:48.58]We'll be here for 40 fucking more goddamn minutes.
[191:52.50]And then I'll finally do it.
[191:54.54]And I'm gonna go, like, another 20 minutes without a problem at all.
[191:59.51]Like, you stupid mo- Oh, I'm about to say a bunch of bad things.
[192:15.52]I can't slow down.
[192:16.60]You've already seen me get to where I got to.
[192:20.18]There's no going back now.
[192:21.44]There's no turning back.
[192:23.12]I'll never get there again.
[192:34.72]Oh my god.
[192:43.16]You're still here.
[192:45.32]I understand, like, for games that are frustrating, only to be frustrating.
[192:51.12]Why do we do this?
[192:53.00]When did these games become popular?
[192:55.40]Hey, you know what I want to do on a Sunday?
[192:57.06]Like, fucking despise a game and myself.
[193:01.45]Have we really reached this far into the fucking horizon?
[193:04.21]Where, like, the only way we can enjoy enjoy anything is by giving ourselves pain?
[193:09.41]What's next?
[193:11.28]next is we're gonna start paying people to like punch us in the face a guy on the street's gonna hand you a controller and you're gonna hold it and he's going to punch you in your nose as hard as he can you're gonna be like whoa this is hard this is a hard game and then he's gonna take your money
[193:40.66]Man, you know, this is like, you know, the sequel is actually way harder than the first one.
[193:45.24]Not the guy just punched you, like, a little bit harder.
[193:47.05]That's the sequel.
[193:49.39]The dude punched you, like, 30% harder in the face.
[193:53.43]And, like, he'll hand you, like, a piece of paper that says, like, achievement, you beat the hard game.
[193:58.21]And then you brag to your friends.
[193:59.62]Yeah, man, yeah, I beat get punched in face, too.
[194:02.68]It was fucking really, really hard, but I did it, though.
[194:05.62]Yeah, I'm like one of the, I'm like, well, I'm like, only, like, 5% of the people in the world have that trophy.
[194:22.71]I'm doing it wrong.
[194:24.79]I'm doing it wrong.
[194:25.31]I'm doing it forever wrong.
[194:29.83]The frustration has taken over my body to a point where I want to go do this in real life to the side of a fucking mountain.
[194:48.12]Fucking god.
[194:51.40]The speedrun for this game is a little over two minutes.
[194:54.24]Yeah, but that's not... You can't expect somebody... That guy probably has like 5,000 hours in this game.
[195:00.74]You know what I mean?
[195:01.60]That's a guy that's probably played this game for like seven and a half days straight without sleeping.
[195:06.08]You can't compare those two things.
[195:36.95]The worst part about this, I'll say it again.
[195:39.19]I have already done this part like six fucking times.
[195:44.43]And I just can't do it again.
[195:49.49]Like the fucking, my hands.
[195:51.24]Oh, I'm so angry.
[195:54.82]Nothing can quell it.
[195:55.56]Ugh.
[196:07.52]Don't you fucking dare.
[196:11.91]Even a free trip to Disney World wouldn't even quell this right now.
[196:16.79]Again, the developer of the game calls me.
[196:19.36]Hello?
[196:22.11]Hey, yeah, it's me, the dev from the game again.
[196:23.87]Oh, hey, what's up, man?
[196:24.68]I didn't hang up on you before.
[196:26.44]Did you not understand what I was saying?
[196:29.10]Well, instead of $25,000, man, we're going to give you and your entire family a free two-month trip to Disney World.
[196:34.10]And you get to skip all the lines.
[196:36.26]You get to ride Space Mountain whenever you want, even when the park closes.
[196:40.18]And I'm going to be like, oh, shit, really?
[196:43.85]Oh, fuck yourself.
[196:48.47]What are you doing?

[197:43.97]Almost just blew that.
[197:44.95]You saw that.
[197:45.43]That was Brad.
[197:47.88]How am I about to blow this?
[197:50.14]Don't ask me.
[197:54.50]Get the anger out of the way.

[198:05.24]I don't get it.
[198:07.74]I got like a tick bit me or whatever.
[198:10.01]I don't know.

[199:03.36]This is how fucking... Boiled blood I am.
[199:07.56]I typed in relaxing music.
[199:08.98]That's what I wrote.
[199:09.54]Like, really?
[199:15.65]I'm so, like, on edge.
[199:17.31]My body can't even do things properly.
[199:21.69]Okay, how about this?
[199:22.53]This was relaxing sleep music.
[199:25.77]We're humanity's last hope.
[199:30.15]Well, that's an ad.
[199:31.09]We'll wait for the ad.
[199:36.77]Play Putt-Putt and the Adventure of the Boiling Blood.
[199:41.35]Not gonna happen.
[199:42.95]Not gonna happen.
[199:44.51]Okay, here we go.
[199:48.96]This is just like zen music.

[199:55.46]Let's just do... Let's just do us.
[200:01.31]Let's just do it the way that we're going to do it.
[200:04.65]Make it nice and easy.
[200:08.28]Okay, I'm ready.
[200:17.26]Didn't fucking help, but just calm down.
[200:30.33]Okay, I'm just going to feel the zen.
[200:32.17]I'm no longer going to speak, okay?
[200:35.39]I'm not going to speak anymore.
[200:36.21]We're just going to play, and I'm going to be very, very quiet and cautious.
[200:39.60]I can already feel it kicking in.
[201:43.81]It's like putting me to sleep.
[201:44.93]It's not helping me play the game.
[201:54.76]Oh my fucking god.
[201:57.26]I'm like, this game is a living nightmare.
[202:10.77]Try coffee house piano music?
[202:19.30]I'm liking this one so far.
[202:20.20]I'm going to stick with this one for another few minutes.
[202:41.25]We made it.
[202:50.31]Not today!
[202:51.63]Easy now.
[202:55.71]Don't do this.
[203:05.26]Aim it over here.
[203:08.63]What are you doing to yourself?
[203:10.69]What are you doing?
[203:13.02]We probably should change the music.
[203:14.34]This is just turning into like a idol in town song.
[203:17.62]I'm going to change the song.
[203:20.44]What was it?
[203:20.74]Coffee house piano song?
[203:21.94]What was it?
[203:23.44]Coffee piano?
[203:27.43]Coffee house piano music.
[203:31.27]Coffee shop music.
[203:35.15]Coffee shop.
[203:36.65]What is this?
[203:37.26]What is this?
[203:40.28]This is not a... Coffee shop piano.
[203:49.41]This wants you to pre-order something.
[203:52.32]Alright, what is this?
[203:52.94]Coffee shop piano.
[203:53.88]Okay.
[203:59.00]Sounds pretty good.
[204:14.93]Why am I scared that something weird is going to happen with this shit?
[204:20.85]I got to be careful and make it happen.
[204:25.44]I'll grab that.
[204:25.96]I'm going to grab the edge.
[204:26.72]It'll happen.
[204:34.42]Here we go.
[204:39.46]Smooth jazz.
[204:40.12]I can't change it now.
[204:43.77]Pray.
[204:44.51]Here it goes.
[204:47.85]God damn it!
[204:50.99]Hold on!
[204:52.89]What the fuck?
[204:57.49]I don't recognize this number.
[204:59.77]What is this number?
[205:05.70]Hello?
[205:08.30]Hey, what's up?
[205:09.00]Who is this?

[205:22.57]It's a great game.
[205:25.68]What's... Okay, so... Alright.
[205:29.90]How many tickets?
[205:32.28]Only one Disneyland ticket.
[205:34.64]Only one.
[205:34.94]You're not even gonna give me a fast lane pass.
[205:40.86]To burn up another 30 minutes?
[205:43.38]And I'm not gonna get a fast lane pass, one ticket to Disneyland.
[205:50.72]Okay.
[205:53.38]Okay.
[205:53.96]No, that sounds alright.

[205:59.69]Love you too.
[206:00.69]Okay, bye.
[206:03.39]Somebody got a free trip to Disneyland, boys and girls!
[206:11.33]And I've been faking it the whole time!
[206:13.03]I can actually play this game really fucking well!
[206:18.15]That would've been fucking awesome.
[206:30.76]That would have been fucking something else, wouldn't it have?
[206:38.45]That would have been something else, wouldn't it have been?
[206:48.04]Back to where we were.
[206:49.02]Get over there.
[206:50.02]Sometimes you just gotta go, fuck!
[206:54.84]God damn it!
[206:58.56]No, I don't wanna.
[207:07.48]Ugh.
[207:07.86]Cry, cry.
[207:10.47]Cry!
[207:11.33]Here come the tears.
[207:14.43]Slow the fuck down, I can't.
[207:17.68]Ever since I sped it up, I've been playing better.
[207:19.78]Now I'm going to slow down.
[207:23.34]Shit in my fucking pants, man.
[207:25.35]Why the fuck?
[207:31.07]I can get up there reliably if I kind of just make it work like this.
[207:42.50]My hand's getting fucking tired.
[207:46.11]I'll give you an excuse.
[207:47.13]I don't care.
[207:47.51]I'll give you an excuse.
[207:49.43]I only get to play this game for another fucking like 22 minutes.
[207:52.13]I'm going to Disneyland, guys.
[207:56.38]God.
[208:05.58]I forgot what game I was playing.
[208:07.60]I forgot what fucking game I was just in.
[208:10.15]And I was just pressing buttons.
[208:12.88]That's when you're in total delirium.
[208:15.24]When you're in total fucking delirium.
[208:18.80]I was just thinking about... I was thinking about Disneyland.
[208:22.83]And not even playing the game.
[208:24.63]I've gone beyond.
[208:25.93]I'm beyond.
[208:26.67]I'm beyond being frustrated.
[208:27.73]I'm lost.
[208:27.99]Oh!
[208:49.88]I'm about- I'm about to fuck- I'm about to- just my hands if they weren't just so greasy!
[209:08.47]Come on!
[209:09.83]No!
[209:16.97]I'm gonna fucking lose- I'm gonna lose my fucking goddamn mind.
[209:20.11]God damn it!
[209:27.62]Hello?
[209:28.46]Fuck you!
[209:29.70]I don't give a shit whatever you're going to give me.
[209:31.74]I ain't fucking doing it anymore.
[209:33.54]I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you stand for.
[209:37.05]You understand?
[209:39.63]Mom?
[209:41.77]No.
[209:42.49]I didn't see the number that came up.
[209:46.07]Yep.
[209:48.93]It's your birthday.
[209:49.89]I missed your birthday?
[209:50.73]What?
[209:53.07]Well, I was going to call earlier.
[209:56.26]Yeah, I was going to call earlier, but I got caught up in something.
[210:01.70]Yeah.
[210:03.88]Well, happy birthday.
[210:04.46]I mean, your gift, I got it on Amazon, so it takes a couple days to get there.
[210:10.03]Prime shipping is pretty awesome, actually.
[210:15.27]Yeah, you'll love it.
[210:18.19]Sorry, I'm sorry if I'm, like, missing your birthday.
[210:20.05]Mm-hmm.
[210:26.03]Mm-hmm.
[210:28.58]Yeah, I'll make sure to... I know, I know I shouldn't be saying those bad words, I know.
[210:32.92]I'm sorry, Mommy.
[210:36.14]Yeah, I'll see you for dinner tomorrow.
[210:40.46]Okay.
[210:41.50]Yep, love you too, Mommy.
[210:43.04]Bye.
[210:54.11]She's watching the stream, right?
[210:55.09]And she's like going to watch the stream.
[210:56.29]She's told me she's going to open the stream up.
[210:57.81]So I got to be like... Okay.
[211:06.54]It's a challenging game if you never played it before.
[211:09.28]Whoopsie.
[211:11.90]Whoopsie daisy.
[211:13.98]It's okay though.
[211:14.56]Like sometimes you have to... Sometimes you have to lose before you win, you know?
[211:22.54]Tricky, tricky.
[211:26.29]Nice.
[211:27.57]Oh, almost.
[211:32.73]Almost there.
[211:34.74]Tricky.
[211:38.46]Ooh, tricky one.
[211:39.40]That was a tricky one.
[211:44.42]Look at these barrels.
[211:45.24]These barrels are like Donkey Kong, you know what I mean?
[211:47.07]Hey, I wonder what happens.
[211:50.55]Maybe if I hit one of those barrels, maybe Diddy Kong will come out.
[211:56.86]So that's a... I like that.
[211:57.68]I like Donkey Kong because that's a... That's like a fan... I usually play like... If you're new to the stream, I play like E-rated games and... That's one of my favorite E-games, for sure.
[212:13.63]Well, let's try going here.
[212:16.61]This way.
[212:17.99]Oops, almost.
[212:18.85]Oopsie.
[212:19.37]Oopsie-daisy.
[212:20.13]Oopsie.
[212:21.39]Oopsie.
[212:23.65]It's... Whoopsie.
[212:26.43]Crap, crapola.
[212:27.91]Oh, crapola, you know?
[212:34.59]Crapola.
[212:47.92]Okay.
[212:53.14]Also, another thing that is really important to me, like if you guys didn't know, prayer.
[212:59.55]And I'm not talking about any sort of religious type of prayer.
[213:02.49]I'm talking about internal prayer.
[213:05.25]You know, you find your center.
[213:07.87]I was taught that by somebody really important in my life, you know, like Mommy.
[213:12.45]I don't know if she's watching or not, but she taught me that.
[213:17.68]It's all about just trying to keep yourself grounded,
[213:24.10]Yeah, and see, I can see we have some really good, really good prayers in the chat here.
[213:27.10]Thank you guys for the support.
[213:28.04]Appreciate it.
[213:29.98]Appreciate that, guys.
[213:37.17]Almost there.
[213:37.77]Almost.
[213:38.83]Almost.
[213:40.31]Almost.
[213:41.59]That was close.
[213:51.16]I'm still at this point.
[213:55.53]Yes, I am, man.
[213:57.03]Yes, I am, man.
[213:58.63]Yes, I am.
[214:04.04]But we don't let our frustration get to us here.
[214:06.28]Not on this stream.
[214:07.08]Let me take this.
[214:10.94]Hold on a minute here.
[214:12.14]Okay.
[214:15.71]Yes.
[214:19.97]Oh, really?
[214:20.97]Okay.
[214:21.57]That's good to know.
[214:24.01]How many months behind on my car payment am I?
[214:29.23]That's okay.
[214:33.85]That's alright.
[214:36.06]Thank you for calling, by the way.
[214:38.56]Yeah, I mean, I'm in the middle of dinner, but thank you for calling.
[214:44.79]Yeah, I'll get on that.
[214:45.95]I will.
[214:46.99]Sometimes, I mean, like my mother taught me a long time ago, always be prudent with your payments.
[214:53.59]Sometimes you get stuck with the... Sometimes you get stuck.
[214:58.15]Okay, thank you.
[214:58.79]Goodbye.
[214:59.13]I can't even...
[215:25.41]No!
[215:28.39]Oh my God, I can't fucking do this.
[215:31.77]God damn it!
[215:34.57]Hi, Mom.
[215:41.84]I know, I know I said a fucking bad word.
[215:43.64]I know I'm saying bad words.
[215:45.62]You don't understand what it's like to be on a stream with a bunch of people judging you and shit.
[215:51.16]I will talk to Father Pastor, I will.
[215:54.16]I promise.
[215:57.17]You know what, Ma?
[215:58.09]You know what, Ma?
[216:00.63]Disown me!
[216:01.25]I don't give a fuck anymore.
[216:07.05]I'm done playing.
[216:07.67]I'm done pretending.
[216:09.31]No more pretending.
[216:10.53]Remember the movie Frozen?
[216:12.73]Remember the movie Frozen?
[216:14.90]I do.
[216:16.16]I remember Frozen.
[216:22.50]That story is about letting go.
[216:30.38]That's how I feel right now.
[216:35.05]Thanks everybody for watching.
[216:55.49]I really appreciate it.
[216:57.43]I probably could have done a little bit better, but that's where I'm going to end the stream here.
[217:02.85]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[217:04.47]Much appreciated.
[217:07.55]This has been a mental breakdown starring me!
[217:12.20]Jeremy985.
[217:13.00]Let's close this.
[217:25.13]Oh, you did good.
[217:26.37]Thank you.
[217:28.41]I'm here for the stream.
[217:29.39]Well...
[217:34.50]One more time.
[217:35.52]No, no.
[217:38.04]I'm addicted.
[217:38.70]I can't help it.
[217:39.14]I have to do it.
[217:40.06]One more time.
[217:42.89]Here we go.
[217:55.62]I'll get there in three minutes.
[217:56.60]What's the speedrun in this game?
[218:01.90]Turn it up.
[218:04.67]Come on!
[218:34.16]On the breakdown!
[218:36.70]SHIT!
[218:51.58]We got until the end of the song.
[218:53.22]It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.
[218:59.65]And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all.
[219:06.94]It's time to see what I can do to test the limits and break the loop.
[219:14.06]No right, no wrong, no.
[219:16.44]Come on.
[219:17.02]Get me up there.
[219:18.12]Come on.
[219:51.50]I got till the end of the song, guys.
[219:53.12]I have till the end of the song.
[220:01.98]The past is in the past.
[220:33.60]Dammit!
[220:39.86]I tried to do it to the music!
[220:41.16]I fucked it up!
[220:53.17]I don't- something's autoplaying.
[221:01.51]It's in-
[221:02.84]It's another version!
[221:11.35]The song's not over!
[221:12.39]The song's not over yet!
[221:18.08]I don't know what's autoplaying.
[221:18.96]The song's not over.
[221:23.10]The song's not over.
[221:25.31]Is it another song?
[221:25.99]If it's another song, if it's another song, we keep going.
[221:28.63]Blockchain.
[221:29.17]Why am I getting taunted?
[221:30.19]Fucking blockchain, like Bitcoin, why?
[221:41.44]Why is this doing this?
[221:43.42]And help create the open marketplace with a limitless potential for growth.
[221:47.40]Key features of Storica.
[221:48.87]Packaging.
[221:49.91]I'm getting fucking Bitcoin ads.
[221:52.91]24-7 customer service.
[221:54.23]Growth.
[221:54.95]The circulation of the STQ token is built around a system designed to consolidate business transactions within the platform through smart contracts, which guarantee transparency.
[222:05.09]Oh, they're talking about Ethereum.
[222:06.79]Goods from all over the world with cryptocurrency and token STQ.
[222:09.96]Cryptocurrency.
[222:11.32]Don't buy this token.
[222:14.02]Oh my fucking god, damn it!
[222:15.70]I can't even get back- I beat this whole fucking thing!
[222:19.92]Like, what's the song?
[222:20.92]Fuck you, it's a two minute ad!
[222:26.58]Fuck off!
[222:27.44]Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.
[222:28.66]What is the song?
[222:31.44]I've never seen- I haven't seen this movie.
[222:33.07]Isn't The Rock in this song?
[222:41.91]Yeah, The Rock is in this song.
[222:44.47]Fucking God.
[222:46.71]No, it's over.
[222:47.13]I burnt out my energy getting like three hours ahead of this.
[222:52.14]I'm so frustrated.
[222:53.40]Shut up.
[222:55.30]I don't want to hear this song.
[223:29.90]One more try.
[223:31.62]One more try.
[223:33.78]This is the last song we're going to listen to.
[223:35.18]One more fucking try.
[223:35.94]I swear to God we're done after this.
[223:37.82]This is going to make me do it.
[223:40.61]You know why?
[223:43.39]It's fucking Pac-Man Park Plaza.
[224:03.71]Hmm.
[224:20.29]Okay.
[224:21.91]We obviously can't get past the first fucking rock in the game anymore.
[224:26.59]So we're going to call that a night.
[224:29.90]I think I did alright in that game until everything was over and I couldn't get up there ever again.
[225:09.53]I just typed in guy screaming into YouTube and that's the first That is guy screaming
[225:27.62]Well, thank you everybody for watching.
[225:31.31]Hope you enjoyed this, uh...
[225:34.92]You know like Cuphead, when you lose to a boss in Cuphead and you get the thing where the Cuphead runs by the flags and you see how far you got?
[225:42.71]My Cuphead got to like 60, it got like 50-60% away past like the first and second flag.
[225:48.53]I did alright.
[225:49.79]My first like real hour and a half in this game, two hours in the game, I did pretty good.
[225:55.64]I saw the challenges, I accomplished them, I got to the surveillance camera.
[226:00.16]Didn't get past that though.
[226:02.01]That's alright.
[226:02.45]Sometimes I'm okay with cashing out up there.
[226:05.27]It was 45%.
[226:05.61]Still at the first part.
[226:06.25]Exactly.

[228:01.63]I was going to play the video of the speedrun.
[228:03.28]Forget it.
[228:03.66]Never mind.
[228:04.02]I'm not going to do that.
[228:04.72]That's like somebody else's content.
[228:06.10]I'm not going to do that.
[228:06.72]That's their content.
[228:11.34]Have a nice night.
[228:14.18]I'm not going to stream somebody else's video and pretend I did it.
[228:17.03]That's not cool.
[228:22.56]But, anywho, let's read some bits.
[228:24.46]Thank you.
[228:25.24]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[228:27.34]Tomorrow night.
[228:29.18]Another off-scheduled stream, but, I mean, technically it's because there was nothing on Thursday and Friday.
[228:34.97]Because Italics is in the building.
[228:40.13]Stream it and watch it.
[228:42.65]You can just type in get over it speedrun.
[228:45.32]Give them the views.
[228:47.10]Give that person the views, not me.
[228:48.26]You're the one that deserves them.
[228:54.86]But yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[228:56.78]Probably around the same time tomorrow.
[228:58.74]Starting between like 7 and 8.
[228:59.80]I don't have any set times for these off, in quotes, scheduled streams.
[229:07.53]We'll just see what happens.
[229:09.47]Tomorrow night though, I'll see you.
[229:10.31]We've got some stuff to play.
[229:12.17]Maybe.
[229:13.11]Maybe I'll play a video game.
[229:14.23]Possible.
[229:15.85]But we can read some bits.
[229:16.91]If you're just going to take off, see you tomorrow.
[229:19.15]Thanks for sticking around.
[229:20.47]And we'll start right now with Ghoul Champ.
[229:23.45]Ghoul Champ, just play Acid Base anyways, but thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the 10 bucks.
[229:28.02]I will play Acid Base in the background at a very tolerable level.
[229:36.44]We'll watch an ad first.
[229:39.55]Anyways, thank you to... Let me turn this back on.
[229:44.50]Thank you, NotRight.
[229:45.54]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.50 respectively.
[229:49.02]At this point, I'm ready for that famous Breaking Bad camera zoom-up from the crawlspace.
[229:53.01]Jeremy lying on the dirt laughing.
[229:54.97]Well, like... What scene is that?
[230:00.83]Is that the thing where he has a bunch of money and he's like, I got all this money, and he's laughing?
[230:04.86]I remember that scene.
[230:08.18]Thank you, though.
[230:08.88]Thank you, MostlyLostForThe$5.
[230:10.30]Here, this will make up for the ad money you'll lose on YouTube.
[230:12.34]Oh, wait.
[230:12.68]Fuck YouTube.
[230:13.10]Fuck YouTube.
[230:16.99]Thank you.
[230:18.58]Thank you, the Pat Marcins for the $1.
[230:21.36]Here's part of the fund to help you defend against Disney's lawyers.
[230:26.10]Come at me.
[230:28.06]I will win that every time.
[230:31.22]What are they going to do?
[230:32.44]Oh, you listened to an extraordinarily popular song while you played a video game.
[230:37.36]What are they going to do?
[230:38.56]What did I gain from that?
[230:40.23]No, I lost 85 viewers when that song came on.
[230:43.09]I lost.
[230:44.37]They actually owe me.
[230:47.65]But thank you.
[230:48.78]Thank you for the referral for the 150.
[230:50.14]Watch a streamer get fucking nuked by Disney.
[230:52.32]What?
[230:52.66]No.
[230:53.10]That's not going to happen.
[230:54.60]Thanks, dude.
[230:55.00]Thank you, Buck Rooster, for the $1.
[230:56.40]Does any of your family watch your content?
[230:59.12]What do they think about it?
[230:59.88]But you already saw.
[231:01.50]You just saw that happen a few times ago.
[231:04.26]Thank you.
[231:04.92]Thank you, Techno Toast, for the $1.
[231:06.60]I'm crying.
[231:07.11]Thank you for streaming this.
[231:07.99]It was wildly entertaining.
[231:09.05]You did so well.
[231:09.83]Thank you.
[231:11.67]Got like 41% of the way through the game.
[231:12.95]It's hard.
[231:15.60]It is very fun, though.
[231:17.04]I'll tell you.
[231:17.90]Like, you want, like, a thumbs up or a thumbs down for this game?
[231:20.84]Two thumbs down.
[231:22.44]Don't buy it.
[231:23.14]Absolutely fucking terrible experience.
[231:25.22]But that's why it gets a thumbs up.
[231:28.25]You know?
[231:28.89]Sometimes, you know how it works in mathematics.
[231:30.89]Double negative is a positive.
[231:33.23]You got two negatives, they run into each other, you're gonna get yourself a positive.
[231:36.81]So, two thumbs way down.
[231:38.83]Fuck this game.
[231:40.43]Actually goes down and then comes back.
[231:42.37]It's kind of like a bell curve.
[231:44.11]It comes back up.
[231:45.73]So, it was a very fun experience.
[231:48.57]Hope you enjoy it.
[231:49.43]It's cheap.
[231:50.43]And it's actually, with all jokes aside, it is a very addicting, fun game if you can stomach the pain that comes with it.
[231:57.44]So, yes.
[231:59.40]Also, thank you to Styx.
[232:00.58]Styx Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[232:02.80]Pray to keep yourself grounded.
[232:04.06]That explains why you're so short.
[232:06.92]Oh, I forgot about this.
[232:10.83]No, okay.
[232:12.08]I just tried to replay the video and got a second ad.
[232:15.22]Whatever the fuck it is.
[232:20.20]Here it comes.
[232:20.70]This is like a Matt Damon movie.
[232:25.51]This is not acid-base.
[232:28.47]What?
[232:28.67]This is like a video game.
[232:29.57]Okay, here we go.
[232:31.93]Nice toddler blow.
[232:35.34]Thank you, BakeMeHome, for the $1.
[232:37.42]Great effing stream, Jerma.
[232:38.90]Are you gonna play Doom, VFR, or Skyrim VR at some point?
[232:43.02]Probably, I mean, maybe.
[232:43.82]I really, once I, like, get... I feel like I played Doom on stream.
[232:49.69]I played Skyrim.
[232:51.19]I made a Skyrim video.
[232:54.55]So, I'm not sure.
[232:56.87]I'm gonna have to say... Probably not on that one.
[233:01.81]But it's alright.
[233:04.18]Because...
[233:06.05]We're getting one more fucking attempt.
[233:15.93]Fucking acid base, come on.
[233:18.69]Okay.
[233:34.93]Now I can quit the game forever and never open it ever again.
[233:41.18]Alright, I'm never opening that ever again, but there it is.
[233:47.62]You can't hear it?
[233:48.94]Yes you can.
[233:50.87]Now you can.
[233:53.71]Well, I don't want to blast out eardrums.
[233:55.81]Alright, thank you to...
[233:59.44]Um, but I'm not sure if I'll play those games.
[234:01.28]Maybe.
[234:02.28]Depends on how much I care about them when they come out.
[234:03.65]Thank you, Bugcat Share.
[234:07.31]Bugcat Share Farms for the ten bucks.
[234:10.77]Ten dollar joke.
[234:13.19]Ten dollar joke.
[234:14.25]I don't know what it was, but hopefully it was funny.
[234:15.99]Thank you, Bug.
[234:17.07]Ten bucks, much appreciated, dude.
[234:18.63]Holy BB, thanks for the one dollar.
[234:19.95]Play Acid Basin, you will beat the level.
[234:21.67]Well, look what I'm doing.
[234:22.53]I'm doing it.
[234:22.81]It didn't work.
[234:28.00]See?
[234:28.74]I did this and I didn't do anything.
[234:30.06]I didn't get any strength from this song.
[234:33.28]Ah, Ben Elnor, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[234:36.28]Made it to the new badge.
[234:37.54]What is the new badge?
[234:38.64]Are you at like $8,000?
[234:39.80]Damn, dude.
[234:43.19]Thank you for your extreme continued support, Ben.
[234:48.99]You have given an outrageous amount of money.
[234:51.69]Louder.
[234:52.07]Alright, you get it louder for 10 seconds.
[234:56.14]Thank you so much, Ben.
[234:56.96]For real.
[234:58.66]You've given a ton of fucking money.
[235:01.52]Billionaire Ben.
[235:02.30]Back at it again.
[235:05.64]There are a few of you guys that have more than $5,000, $10,000.
[235:09.25]Like, getting close to it.
[235:13.59]I'm not doing it louder.
[235:14.57]Alright, I closed the window.
[235:17.85]Come on.
[235:18.35]Let's be real here.
[235:19.41]Let's chill out.
[235:19.99]I don't want to play Acid Base.
[235:25.29]Thank you, Tel, for the $1.
[235:26.81]How do these bit things work?
[235:27.95]Well, you just, you figured it out.
[235:30.89]Thank you, Tel, for the $1.
[235:34.07]Wild Ha Buddy, thanks for the $1.
[235:35.46]Donation for bringing the seal home fund.
[235:39.28]The seal died.
[235:40.36]Sorry.
[235:41.42]Mostly Lost, thanks for the $1.
[235:42.82]Unsubbing and undonating.
[235:44.96]Well, you had to donate to say that, so technically did you?
[235:47.96]I don't know.
[235:50.53]Ben, again, with $100 that I missed earlier.
[235:53.17]Jesus Christ.
[235:54.13]A little bit of holiday cheer for you.
[235:57.81]Is that $400 tonight from Ben?
[236:01.35]God damn.
[236:03.97]I'm going to have to, like, tattoo your name on my, like, face.
[236:06.71]I'm going to have to get, like, a Ben Eleanor tattoo across my chest.
[236:12.47]Thank you, Ben, so much.
[236:16.73]You are too kind.
[236:20.65]Nipple tattoo.
[236:25.37]VameVan, thanks for the bits.
[236:27.01]I got a frog in my throat.
[236:28.99]Plastic children's strap.
[236:30.81]I don't think it does anything.
[236:31.95]I was told not to do it.
[236:33.12]Maybe I should have tried.
[236:35.10]JauntMan, thanks for the $1.
[236:36.52]SkeetSnake, thank you.
[236:39.34]AdeptVM, thanks for the bits.
[236:41.24]Ben, again for the $100 that we caught earlier.
[236:43.92]QuickCrab, thank you for the $10.
[236:46.70]Pro tip, misalign your CPU by building speed for 12 hours to go extra fast.
[236:53.16]Wait, misalign your QPU?
[236:58.52]What is QPU?
[236:59.81]Questions per... Upside down?
[237:02.43]Questions per input?
[237:04.55]Qualms per universe?
[237:06.21]What is that?
[237:06.67]What is QPU?
[237:08.75]QQ?
[237:10.15]Half a press?
[237:14.85]Well, thank you, quick crab.
[237:17.91]Unput.
[237:18.37]He doesn't know about building up infinite speed.
[237:20.19]Why would I?
[237:21.49]Half a press of what?
[237:22.93]Half a press of what?
[237:24.15]What are we half pressing?
[237:29.58]Quadruple parallel.
[237:30.52]No, that's not it.
[237:31.14]Quadruple parallel universe.
[237:32.30]That's not it.
[237:33.12]Questions per upside down.
[237:35.02]That's what it is.
[237:35.90]That's how many questions that somebody can reliably answer while they're upside down.
[237:39.77]It's seven or eight.
[237:41.39]Because then the blood starts to rush to your head and you have to get up.
[237:45.47]Thank you a tasty pizza for the $1.
[237:47.83]It's not a speedrun without a timer.
[237:49.03]This is true Zombie C Slayer, Zombie Z Slayer for the $1.
[237:53.19]Yes, dad.
[237:53.91]Yes, son.
[237:54.47]Thank you Cool cat.
[237:56.05]Thanks for the $4.
[237:56.89]Please consider streaming all putt-putt games.
[237:58.95]That would be a great streaming material Keep up the great work.
[238:01.85]Well, cool.
[238:03.67]I don't think I'm gonna do that There are like 10 putt-putt games and all of them are like that
[238:12.68]We'll see.
[238:13.72]You'll be able to tell if I 100% run out of something to stream because we're going to play all the Putt-Putt games in a row.
[238:23.80]Once Jerma985 is out of content ideas, that's where you'll see Putt-Putt.
[238:35.05]Then you'll know.
[238:42.17]Same time.
[238:42.89]So tomorrow.
[238:43.93]That's not true.
[238:44.79]I got more than one trick up my sleeve, guys.

[238:58.28]Ben, again, for the $100 earlier.
[239:00.68]Like I said, you've given about $400 or $500 this stream.
[239:05.35]That is a holy shit.
[239:06.83]That's a lot of money insanity.

[239:44.21]Thank you, though, man.
[239:46.23]TechnoToast, again, thank you for the $1.
[239:49.49]If it makes you feel any better, Jeremiah, on your very first run of getting over it, you got way farther than another streamer.
[239:56.97]That's cool.
[239:58.25]I don't want to call out people's names.
[239:59.53]I don't want to say anybody's name.
[240:02.10]You know, because that's, you know, if I did get further, then it's all about entertainment.
[240:05.92]It's all about how cool, you know, how much fun would you like that person.
[240:08.26]I'm not going to call a lot of people on stream.
[240:10.42]But thank you for that.
[240:11.04]I appreciate it.
[240:13.36]Carry the one.
[240:14.06]Uh, Lindsay.
[240:19.02]I think I got this before.
[240:23.12]Yes, no I didn't.
[240:24.16]Lensy6, thanks for the $6.
[240:25.97]Nice Germa reference.
[240:26.93]I made it $6 so you wouldn't count wrong this time.
[240:30.19]I'm glad I didn't count wrong.
[240:32.59]That would be embarrassed.
[240:35.29]Dylan from Homeroom, thank you for the bits.
[240:37.15]Have some bits, nerd.
[240:39.91]Well, that's fine, Dylan.
[240:43.08]I'm up here on the school play trying to learn lines and get over stage fright.
[240:50.19]And what are you doing back there?
[240:51.05]Making jokes?
[240:52.41]Making fun of people?
[240:54.65]Talking shit about people?
[240:56.81]Apply yourself, Dylan.
[240:58.43]And maybe you'll be able to achieve it.
[241:00.44]Achieve your dreams.
[241:01.24]Apply yourself.
[241:01.90]Don't bring other people down.
[241:02.80]Bring yourself up.
[241:03.46]Because when you bring yourself up, that's how you succeed for real.
[241:12.39]Funny man.
[241:13.35]Funny man.
[241:15.75]Thank you though, Lindsay.

[241:30.40]Thanks for the 120.
[241:31.18]Get a haircut, you hippie.
[241:32.18]It didn't even turn my webcam on.
[241:34.02]So there's no way you would even know.
[241:35.32]How do you know what my hair looks like?
[241:36.98]I could have got a haircut yesterday and you don't even know.
[241:40.00]So you don't know.
[241:41.26]I haven't used a webcam once.
[241:43.04]But thank you.
[241:43.76]Please not today.
[241:45.46]Travelboy22, thanks for the two bucks.
[241:48.86]I don't think it was possible for you to be any more of a meme streamer after you dabbed on stream, but here we are.
[241:54.41]No, I don't.
[241:55.17]I'm not a meme streamer.
[241:56.03]Don't do that.
[241:56.49]Don't give me that label.
[241:58.05]Please.
[242:00.70]I don't want that label.
[242:01.34]I don't want that fucking meme streamer label.
[242:04.84]Just call me anything else.
[242:06.36]Call me whatever the fuck you want.
[242:07.94]Don't call me a meme streamer.
[242:11.13]You can call me stupid.
[242:12.09]You can call me ugly.
[242:13.23]You can call me short.
[242:15.39]You short streamer.
[242:16.43]You don't call me a meme streamer.
[242:21.95]Old, like washed up.
[242:23.45]I'll take those a thousand times over meme streamer.
[242:35.17]Thank you, though.
[242:37.21]Thank you to Sparkier Hat, Me Double J, and then Bugcat again.
[242:46.47]Thank you, Bugcat, for your $1 again.

[242:51.71]Thank you, Stormy Choo, very much for the $15.

[243:36.10]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[243:37.68]Old man hand will never be a problem for the kids of the future.
[243:40.16]Just imagine seeing this stream in like 300 years and finding out you don't have hands anymore.
[243:47.48]I'm of the proponent that we're not going to have eyes.
[243:49.81]We're going to link into a matrix.
[243:53.73]You will link, your brain will turn into a computer chip and they'll put you in wherever you want.
[244:00.20]I'll be alright with that.
[244:00.90]Hopefully I'm still alive.
[244:04.21]Thank you, Lord of the Fatties, for the $1.
[244:06.01]Knock again for the $1.
[244:08.43]Use the kick for $1.

[244:17.80]Damn.

[244:22.32]And it just says $20 joke.
[244:24.20]Thank you.
[244:25.82]Virtual meme.
[244:26.48]Yeah, just put me inside of a meme.
[244:29.66]I'll be able to eat for the rest.
[244:30.66]I'll be able to eat there for, like, three months.
[244:32.44]I'll be able to fulfill my, like, internet stomach with memes.
[244:36.70]Because I'm a meme streamer, right?
[244:40.75]Don't do that.
[244:41.97]Don't let this become a thing.
[244:44.17]Kill it now.
[244:45.77]Kill it now.
[244:46.33]Kill it.
[244:46.63]Squelch it now.
[244:47.19]Kill it now.
[244:48.13]Get it out of your system now.
[244:51.79]Ah, the jammy.
[244:52.99]The jammy F word.
[244:55.82]He's using the F word on my stream.
[244:57.14]That's not nice.
[244:58.22]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[245:01.72]Do you know what waits for you at the top?
[245:04.94]I don't think I'll ever know because I'm never going to be the game.
[245:07.66]Hopefully it's something nice.
[245:10.46]But thank you, Jamie.
[245:13.29]LaFerro, thanks for the $1.
[245:17.01]Don't look at chat after Thursday.
[245:18.67]What are you talking about?
[245:19.87]What's happening on Thursday?
[245:22.25]MrOffensive, thanks for the $1.95.
[245:23.89]Hey, Jeremy, here's all my current bits just for you.
[245:25.81]I promise I'll save up to 10k bits someday.
[245:30.48]$2 is just as good as $10,000, man.
[245:34.28]Don't worry about that.
[245:37.10]Anything that anybody gives is fucking more than I could have possibly imagined.
[245:40.72]So, thank you so much, everybody.
[245:44.91]Whether you give $10, $1,000, or $0, don't worry.
[245:51.69]I will never hang that over your heads for any reason.

[245:57.63]Freddy's Twitch.
[245:58.53]Thanks for five bucks.
[245:59.25]Damn, getting over at Smurfs.
[246:00.93]Ruining matches in the lower ranks.
[246:02.97]Shaking my head.
[246:06.21]Might actually be a fun game.
[246:11.42]This game with like headshots only and you have to hit somebody right in the directly in like the face with the mallet could actually be pretty entertaining stuff.
[246:19.86]You know what I mean?
[246:23.50]Like, you got a guy that's swinging, jumping around.
[246:26.26]It could be like a 2v2 type situation, you know what I mean?
[246:28.48]Like, 2v2, and you have to swing and hit people with the swords.
[246:32.56]I mean, you could have different weapons, too.
[246:35.14]Maybe they have longer reach.
[246:36.58]Maybe they could have... Hold on, let me take this.
[246:45.05]Hey, what's up?
[246:47.41]You're still watching?
[246:49.29]You like that idea, huh?
[246:52.14]yeah yeah yeah like you could have like uh like two people different weapons upgrades um like fold all the loot boxes and when you open it you can there's a potential you'll get like a longer item or like a cosmetic different uh pots so and yeah I would love to yeah like imagine like imagine the pots
[247:13.78]You got, like, instead of a pot, it could be, like, a plant pot.
[247:17.40]It could be, one could be, like, a little bathtub.
[247:20.31]One could be, like, a bucket.
[247:21.11]One could be, like, a sand bucket.
[247:22.11]Like, you're going, like, to the beach.
[247:24.15]There could be some, like, really, really rare ones.
[247:28.11]Yeah, I can come out next week.
[247:29.15]For sure.
[247:33.05]Yeah.
[247:34.89]Let's make it happen, man.
[247:36.21]Let's make it happen.
[247:36.69]Let's make some fucking money.
[247:37.61]You know what I mean?
[247:38.05]Let's make it happen.
[247:39.91]$4 loot boxes.
[247:41.19]You'll make $60 million in two weeks.
[247:44.45]Let's make some money.
[247:47.37]All right, yeah.
[247:48.61]Okay, love you too.
[247:49.13]Bye.
[247:49.49]All right, there we go.
[247:51.45]What do we got?
[247:54.03]Oblong thanks for the $1.10.
[247:57.57]Shitting in public toilets gives me less anxiety than this stream.
[248:02.40]No, actually, I gave up on being anxious in a public bathroom a long time ago.
[248:05.82]I don't know why.
[248:06.76]I used to never go to the bathroom in a public bathroom.
[248:10.85]Absolutely not.
[248:12.93]I would only pee only.
[248:15.79]I would never take a number two in a public bathroom until I just kind of stopped giving a shit.
[248:21.21]And I think that happens when you get older.
[248:24.25]You know, the guy that's just in the stall taking a shit when you're in there, you become that guy when you get to be 30 years old.
[248:32.79]Because you don't care.
[248:34.73]You don't care with that, with, like, the, oh, no, somebody's going to come in and know I'm doing this.
[248:39.25]I don't give a shit.
[248:39.95]I'm 30.
[248:40.07]Who cares?
[248:40.97]What, am I going to be, like, embarrassed?
[248:45.03]No, maybe when I was, like, 20.
[248:48.50]You become that guy, and it just kind of happens overnight.
[248:56.02]But thank you to Oblong.
[248:58.62]Thanks a lot.

[249:34.25]Thanks for the $1.
[249:34.95]Do to believe in you.
[249:35.53]Well, I think I believe in you too.

[250:04.90]If so, which ones did you pick?
[250:05.90]None.
[250:07.98]I didn't pick any.
[250:09.24]I'll give you my games of the year if you'd like.
[250:13.43]I think I could do that right now, maybe.
[250:15.99]In no order, because I don't think anything... I don't know.
[250:19.05]Resident Evil 7.

[250:57.43]Obviously Cuphead was awesome.
[251:00.05]Hollow Knight was there too.
[251:03.17]I'd probably say those are like in the top three.
[251:05.17]Hollow Knight, Cuphead, and Resident Evil 7 VR.
[251:10.79]You can't rate a game in pieces?
[251:11.89]Why not?

[251:57.86]Thank you, Dragon Flyer.
[251:59.00]One, two, three for the five dollars.
[252:00.20]Jeremy, you're my favorite content creator.
[252:01.54]Will there be a point in the future where you're selling merchandise with your name on it?
[252:04.78]With our name on it?
[252:07.56]I don't know.
[252:09.32]Merchandise is tricky for me because I always have an idea and then it doesn't go anywhere.
[252:13.21]I'd like to keep quiet about merchandise because every time I bring it up, I'm going to do this.
[252:18.86]I don't do it, so we'll see.
[252:21.80]Thank you, though, Dragon.
[252:25.37]Thank you to Nuclear Ma.
[252:27.79]Cool54864 for the $1 each.
[252:31.29]Robo Gandalf, thanks for the $2.
[252:32.25]Gave him that Gandalf.
[252:34.89]Yeah, I did.
[252:36.49]Obvious Ninja, thanks for the $1.
[252:38.80]Quoting the game as the autosave.
[252:40.34]That's good to know.
[252:44.82]And I think that is it.
[252:48.12]There's one or two at the top here.
[252:51.12]Thank you, Cheesequirt, for the $1.
[252:52.60]Thanks for the stream.
[252:53.56]You're seriously an inspiration to me.
[252:55.06]Haha.
[252:56.52]Well, I'm glad I can be that, if that's true.
[253:02.34]Thank you for that.
[253:03.44]That means fucking a lot to me.
[253:06.54]Night of Fireland, thanks for the bits.
[253:08.32]1v1 me in Mario Kart.
[253:09.90]I hate Mario Kart, so no.
[253:11.46]Sorry if that makes everybody angry.
[253:13.04]I have to tell you this.
[253:14.68]I have to double dash.
[253:15.51]The Blue Turtle Show, if you're in first place or second place in Mario Kart, don't do it.
[253:20.87]It's stupid.
[253:21.97]I don't like that game.
[253:23.31]You have to stay in third or fourth place in Mario Kart.
[253:26.48]Listen to me.
[253:27.10]Listen to me.
[253:28.62]Mario Kart, if you're in first or second place, you're going to be in last place.
[253:34.62]Somebody's gonna throw a blue, they give blue shells and like lightning bolts to everybody that's in eighth and ninth place.
[253:40.83]You don't, you don't want, you'd never want to be in first place or second place in Mario Kart.
[253:43.95]Don't ever try to win.
[253:45.35]You have to stay in fourth fucking place until the last lap, the last turn, use your one item that you've been saving the entire time and try to pass the guy in first place and win.
[253:58.19]Being in first place in Mario Kart is a guarantee to get hit by a blue shell.
[254:01.31]Ever since Double Dash.
[254:03.53]Mario 64?
[254:04.95]Perfect.
[254:06.67]Great game.
[254:11.48]My competitive Mario Kart.
[254:16.48]Learn to out-boost the blue shells, scrub.
[254:22.34]Maybe just bad.
[254:23.30]But it's a blue shell and the lightning bolt.
[254:25.32]What are you supposed to do about the lightning bolt?
[254:27.04]What if you're in like fourth place and somebody gets a lightning bolt in ninth place and they just squash you?
[254:33.58]Oh, sorry.
[254:35.83]And then you're going to get hit by the one fucking idiot in the lobby that just gets green shells and just throws them forward.
[254:43.13]It doesn't even care.
[254:44.15]You're going to get hit by the random like eight green shells that are continuously bouncing around in the map because of everyone.
[254:49.89]Green shell, now ditch it.
[254:51.10]Just throw it into the wall.
[254:57.86]I mean, I actually, I kind of just don't like racing games.
[255:01.76]Not like a big fan of them.
[255:02.94]I've never been like a racing game fan really ever.
[255:09.49]But thank you, everybody.
[255:15.95]Someone got to your farthest point in 45 seconds.
[255:18.09]I think you should try to beat their time.
[255:19.48]Nope.
[255:21.28]Thank you, Mr. Dr. Professor Nova for that.
[255:25.15]Thank you, GhoulChamp, for the $10.
[255:26.35]And I think that gets me right there that it does end.
[255:29.09]Now we're going to go rapid fire.
[255:31.17]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[255:32.33]ZombieZSlayer, $2.
[255:33.03]Thanks a lot, man.

[255:39.30]6'3", ChadStreamerGerman, that's me.
[255:43.42]SparkyYourHat, thanks for the $1.
[255:44.50]One of the best streamers out there.
