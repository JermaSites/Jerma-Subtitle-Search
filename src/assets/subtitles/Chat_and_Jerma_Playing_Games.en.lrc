[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.55]Come on.
[00:02.03]Let me just put my new coffee down.
[00:06.75]I might sound different, too.
[00:08.23]I might have to change some settings, because I had to clean every nozzle, every knob, every single one needed to be cleaned.
[00:16.16]Hold on.
[00:22.95]Let me see.
[00:23.33]How's that?
[00:23.75]Is that bad?
[00:25.01]Good?
[00:25.47]Worse?
[00:25.93]Better?
[00:26.17]Hold on.
[00:27.31]Let me...
[00:37.53]I mean, we're muted now, but how about now?
[00:40.07]Can you hear me?
[00:40.49]Okay, how do I sound?
[00:47.63]Sound okay?
[00:48.47]Okay.
[00:50.72]Uh, well, let me go over why we're starting like an hour and 20 minutes late.
[00:56.00]Uh...
[00:57.77]Because I dumped an entire 16 ounces of coffee on my desk and all like into my computer and shit.
[01:04.02]My computer is underneath my desk to the left.
[01:06.56]I have a big L-shaped desk.
[01:09.44]It's a beautiful desk.
[01:11.12]The thing is absolutely wonderful.
[01:12.81]It's walnut wood.
[01:16.35]And I fucking did the thing I promised myself I would never do.
[01:21.15]And I didn't even take one sip out of it, either.
[01:24.85]I came up here to get ready to stream.
[01:27.30]Like, okay, I'm ready to hit the button to start streaming.
[01:29.86]Here we go.
[01:30.20]Like, it's time.
[01:31.98]And I dumped the whole fucking thing.
[01:36.10]I tried to put it down on the coaster, and it just, like... And I... It's... Because my hands were a little wet.
[01:41.32]And those of you guys that... Let me tell you something about glass, okay?
[01:45.38]Don't fucking use glass.
[01:46.43]Don't drink out of glass.
[01:48.15]It's not worth it.
[01:50.82]If you get even one drop of water on your hands, when you grab onto glass, it makes the glass a thousand times more slippery.
[02:06.47]I don't know why we put liquid in these things.
[02:09.95]Glass's superpower is getting really hard to hold onto when it's wet.
[02:17.99]Use ceramic.
[02:19.71]Or metal.
[02:21.75]Drink out of tin.
[02:23.10]I'm getting a tin cup.
[02:24.40]It's gonna be, I'm gonna get a sippy cup.
[02:29.14]Everyone thinks that that's a joke.
[02:30.44]No, no, I'm going to get a, I'm gonna, on Amazon, I'm gonna go buy like a child six pack of sippy cups.
[02:39.85]And just have him ready.
[02:41.07]Every- anytime.
[02:42.67]Cause this was fucking horrible.
[02:44.17]I- I didn't even react right away because I was gonna cry.
[02:47.48]I just like dumped it.
[02:48.40]It was like this- this is a brand new desk and like a new place and...
[02:53.65]Not even fucking two months and I dump a fucking full 16 ounces of coffee over my computer, onto my, my, my, um, XLR input, my stream deck, my monitor, my fucking controller, my phone, my computer.
[03:10.44]It was awful.
[03:11.46]It was horrible and I almost cried.
[03:15.30]But we can hold on to those tears now because we're gonna do something today.
[03:19.94]Stop drinking coffee.
[03:21.08]How do you stop doing something?
[03:24.21]I can't just stop drinking coffee.
[03:25.83]Coffee is like my whole life.
[03:33.54]Two servings of coffee.
[03:34.50]It was supposed to last.
[03:36.24]It was supposed to last me like an hour and a half.
[03:42.55]Hey, just don't do that.
[03:43.99]No, alright, I just had to vent to you guys, so let's get started.
[03:49.35]Today what's gonna happen is something different, and I'll give you a quick story of how this came about.
[03:52.78]I was gonna play Super Smash Brothers today, the World of Light.
[03:57.88]Because I'm like addicted to it.
[03:59.70]Oh, just stop playing World of Light!
[04:01.58]Just stop doing that!
[04:03.39]I'm addicted to the World of Light.
[04:06.50]It's very fun.
[04:08.60]It's really interesting.
[04:09.88]And I talked about it in the pre-stream chat.
[04:12.88]I was kind of hanging out here.
[04:14.56]I'm like, oh yeah, guys, I got an idea.
[04:15.88]I'm going to play World of Light Smash Brothers.
[04:18.48]And when you say that, that's like, no.
[04:21.14]It was just like, no, that's like, don't do that.
[04:25.43]But I want to do it.
[04:27.03]And I probably am.
[04:29.31]And somebody mentioned just playing Nickelodeon Flash games.
[04:33.36]And I said, I don't know, maybe you guys want to play Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network Flash games?
[04:40.22]One guy said it.
[04:41.72]Actually, it was two guys.
[04:44.67]And I said, alright, fine.
[04:45.49]Because I want to prove to you guys, without even a reasonable doubt, that one day you will be the one guy.
[04:53.53]Everyone thinks that's just like a joke.
[04:55.83]Now, I'm playing Nickelodeon Flash games, and not only that, you guys are going to get to pick which ones.
[05:00.09]I have the extension turned on.
[05:02.32]That makes it so it shows a percentage of where everyone is clicking on the screen.
[05:08.82]This is going to be a mess.
[05:12.64]So it's your guy's job to browse.
[05:17.35]You can control me.
[05:19.03]I'm going to go where the highest percentage is.
[05:25.87]You want me to test it now?
[05:29.76]Let's test it.
[05:33.32]How does it work?
[05:39.11]Alright, well, it looks like it's working.
[05:40.89]I remember people clicking on the moon.
[05:44.15]Alright.
[05:45.91]Wow, you guys are really, really coordinated.
[05:48.15]You're going 80, 70, 74% on the moon, huh?
[05:49.65]Oh, almost had it.
[06:01.70]32%, 31%.
[06:01.94]Holy shit, there's a lot of clicks.
[06:08.37]Okay, I'm gonna have to like, I'm gonna have to make the clicks.
[06:10.97]Only one click per person until I stop it.
[06:14.69]Alright, that's enough of that.
[06:18.79]How do I get this off the screen?
[06:20.92]Okay, there we go.
[06:22.66]Also, I need to...
[06:25.52]Let me see if I can make this... Yeah, I can.
[06:29.39]Let's make it... How does that sound?
[06:31.11]Alright, we're gonna try this again.
[06:32.87]I want to do one more test.
[06:35.33]Please, everybody, if 100% of you guys don't click the moon, the stream's gonna end.
[06:41.93]It needs to be 100%.
[06:42.31]100% or the stream ends.
[06:55.96]I think you guys broke it.
[06:58.14]What's with the weird half circle there on the bottom?
[07:04.66]Make sure this is gone.
[07:05.82]Yeah, it's on there, right?
[07:08.05]What are you guys even clicking on down there?
[07:13.19]That was 100% for it.
[07:14.53]People are clicking on the extension button.
[07:20.53]Oh, they're clicking on the moons.
[07:23.38]But that's not a moon, though.
[07:28.01]Okay, well, it works.
[07:30.27]I'm gonna regret this.
[07:33.04]Oh, fuckin' Jesus, hold on.
[07:37.22]Okay.
[07:38.82]So, oh, yayay, where do we start here?
[07:41.90]Okay, you guys, I'll show you, I'll show you, we'll see where we're gonna start.
[07:45.55]Let's turn that off.
[07:48.41]Let's pull this up.
[07:50.63]Well, it looks like we're already on this one, but hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:53.75]There are other options here.
[07:54.65]Let me just go like this real quick.
[08:01.91]Okay, I gotta like put the tabs on here.
[08:06.22]Okay, so here are the tabs.
[08:09.62]If you guys could go ahead and see, right now we're on, this is Cartoon Network.
[08:12.54]We have, I'll just go through them all.
[08:14.68]Here's Nickelodeon.
[08:16.84]Here is Wild Tangent, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Miniclip, and Armor Games.
[08:23.44]Could you guys go ahead and tell me which tab you'd like me to start on, please?
[08:34.91]Why are people starting over here?
[08:37.33]This is not part of the options.
[08:47.17]I can't click that eye.
[08:48.17]Well, look, okay, we got, most of you guys are over at Armor, but it's, click the ad.

[15:22.94]No, we don't need free shipping.
[15:42.00]Well, uh... Alright, 47% want me to click here.
[15:47.80]I can click here.
[15:48.34]It doesn't mean I have to press a number, guys.
[15:50.12]It has to be plus one.

[16:42.19]Oh my fucking god.
[16:53.36]Well... Looks like... Alright, that's $25.
[16:56.60]To qualify for free shipping.
[17:08.05]You guys aren't even gonna let me get the free shipping?
[17:10.27]You're gonna make me check out right now without free shipping?
[17:15.93]You guys gonna make me suffer?
[17:25.76]Wow.
[17:26.98]I can't believe it.
[17:28.18]I can't believe you guys are gonna make me do this.
[17:55.42]Okay, there are 30,000 clicks here, by the way.
[18:00.25]I think I'm going to call it at 30,000 clicks on each one.
[18:08.94]But, oh.
[18:10.50]Oh my God!
[18:12.58]How the fuck are you guys gonna be able to do this?
[18:19.37]Is there even a possible way for you to do that?
[18:24.57]I gotta reset the clicks here.
[18:25.97]Yeah, I can, hold on, I gotta reset the clicks.
[18:32.62]Okay, hold on, hold on a second.
[18:36.29]And by the way, now I'm including a one click.

[18:42.56]So make sure it counts.
[18:46.64]You wanna make sure this counts.
[18:50.30]One click per viewer.
[18:51.83]You understand?
[18:54.23]Hold on, I'll make it easy for you.
[18:57.61]Hold on, I gotta get in close.
[19:01.11]That's not working.
[19:07.80]I gotta go even closer than this.
[19:12.12]I think that's it.
[19:12.68]Hold on, maybe a little bit more.
[19:18.28]That's gonna be so hard.
[19:22.52]Okay, here we go.

[21:29.44]That thing is as big as the- I don't know what I can do with that.
[21:36.83]Everyone has voted so far, good thing you weren't looking at the prices, guys.
[21:48.49]Alright, looks like it's gonna be, uh, Wailord.
[21:52.71]by an incredibly large margin.
[21:55.57]Reset?
[21:56.29]It's not my fault that you guys weren't paying attention to what the fuck you were clicking on.
[22:00.61]Are you serious?

[23:08.83]That's not where people are clicking.
[23:14.25]Now we're doing one per customer here, one per user.
[23:17.45]When we get to about 1,800 to 2,000 is clicks.
[23:23.48]And by the way, if you want to participate, if you don't know what's going on, all you got to do is click the screen.
[23:28.16]You just got to activate the button there and then click the screen anywhere you want.
[23:33.08]This is, this is Twitch, uh, plays Flash games.

[30:08.57]I don't want to go to fucking Amazon, guys.
[30:16.73]No, we're going where we're supposed to go.
[30:27.51]I want to go to Disneyland.
[30:34.75]Go to Reddit.
[30:35.37]I mean, I could go to Reddit.
[30:36.59]That would actually be kind of funny.
[30:38.89]That would be really, really interesting, actually.
[30:47.44]We could probably do something pretty fun.
[30:54.81]No, I'm not going to go to like porn.
[30:56.73]That's not going to happen, guys.
[31:12.60]Cool math games.
[31:20.28]Alright, let me go back to where we were supposed to be, which is here.
[31:28.00]This is our stream now.
[31:40.09]I'm not clicking another ad.
[31:46.49]Fuck me.
[31:52.48]Now, here's what we're gonna do.
[31:54.82]I'm gonna pick, I'm gonna stop this.
[31:58.14]And I'm gonna go here.
[32:00.76]I'm gonna make it so you guys can't click on anything else.
[32:05.54]You know what I mean?
[32:06.68]Here's how this is gonna work.
[32:08.00]Watch this.
[32:11.58]You ready for this?
[32:22.54]Yeah, try to deal with this!
[32:25.24]Huh?
[32:26.30]Now you have to click somewhere up here.
[32:30.12]Good luck.
[32:37.31]Yeah, good luck to you.
[32:41.15]No.
[32:42.01]Oh my fucking god.
[32:53.44]Ugh.
[32:59.69]That doesn't mean I have to click there.
[33:04.83]I'm gonna play a flash game like I was supposed to do an hour ago.
[33:14.06]Okay, it looks like 6%- Oh my god, no.
[33:16.76]No, I'm- Pick from here.
[33:21.22]Here.
[33:22.92]Here is a better idea.
[33:27.53]Oh shit, whoops.
[33:37.50]It's like all stretched.
[33:39.48]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:45.90]There.
[33:47.24]Now you should be able to see everything on screen.
[33:53.40]Hey, look, there you go.
[33:55.12]Alright, you're gonna pick your favorite show, okay?
[34:00.43]Pick your favorite show in a second.
[34:04.17]I'm gonna get it nice and close.
[34:09.83]I can't believe I'm buying fucking socks.
[34:16.24]So I gotta get a little closer though.
[34:21.06]Like that.
[34:22.60]Okay.
[34:24.14]Good luck.
[34:25.63]Let's actually do this for the first time in about like fucking 30 or 40 minutes.
[34:41.38]Oh man, this is close.
[34:44.35]I don't know which one that is.
[34:45.47]Oh, that's all in the same circle though.
[34:57.48]Courage is currently winning.
[35:08.32]Okay, I think it's gonna be Courage.
[35:12.19]Need to zoom?
[35:12.71]Alright, we gotta zoom in closer here though.
[35:14.65]Cause that's correct.
[35:23.83]Do it again.
[35:29.94]Go for it.
[35:33.66]Courage.
[35:35.66]It's Courage the Cowardly Dog with Courage the Cowardly Dog Show!
[35:47.52]You guys didn't even know Snoopy was on this list.
[35:49.90]What are you, crazy?
[35:53.08]Alright, it's Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[35:55.92]There's 2,000 clicks.
[36:00.54]I need to get this back to, like, normal.
[36:07.05]Alright, Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[36:08.41]But what Courage the Cowardly Dog?
[36:10.39]I'm not clicking that!
[36:12.05]Okay?
[36:12.95]So, I'm sorry.
[36:18.72]I'm not gonna click the ad, it's already over.
[36:20.52]I'm not clicking on it.
[36:22.32]We're not going back to fucking the Pokémon store.
[36:42.94]Why does it only have one game?
[36:44.48]Yeah, why?
[37:08.32]Okay Okay fun Yeah, I told you guys you were gonna have power and
[37:38.78]I can't take it away from you, no.
[38:15.83]We did this already.
[38:19.99]I'm turning ad block on after this.
[38:46.50]You're gonna end up living under a bridge with nothing but Pikachu socks.
[38:56.84]Alright, let's hold on, hold on, hold on.
[38:58.20]Let's refresh it.
[39:04.01]Wow, there's a fight going on here actually.
[39:06.51]I'm very surprised by this.
[39:08.53]I might have to enhance.
[39:16.81]Yeah, I'm gonna- I'm gonna- we're gonna re- stop.
[39:18.63]I gotta redo this.
[39:19.21]I gotta- I have to go in and enhance this.
[39:26.05]This is too close.
[39:38.00]Holy shit!
[39:40.12]Wow!
[39:40.94]This is unbelievable!
[39:44.04]It's- I have to enhance it again.
[39:50.58]That's too- I have to do- we have to go closer.
[39:53.18]We have to go even deeper.
[39:57.17]I can't even go that deep.
[39:58.37]It won't even let me.
[40:34.08]This is fucking ridiculous.
[40:36.18]Why do some of you guys want me to click in the middle?
[40:55.01]Well, it looks like democracy has won.
[41:04.93]Yeah, democracy has won.
[41:09.85]I'm clicking cancel.
[41:12.69]Let me just back it up for a second here, though.
[41:14.19]Hold on.
[41:24.14]Cancel.
[41:25.98]Wow.
[41:28.34]That's kind of unbelievable, guys.
[41:31.30]Unbelievable.
[41:57.24]Watch the latest video.
[42:13.95]What happens when I click this though?
[42:17.60]Am I gonna get like an ad?
[42:42.47]I want to be the very best that no one ever was.
[42:49.15]To catch them is my real test.
[42:52.05]To train them is my cause.
[42:54.60]I will travel across the land, searching far and wide.
[43:01.78]Each Pokémon to understand the power that's inside.
[43:12.76]It's only halfway done.
[43:28.25]Holy shit, the subs.
[43:36.06]Okay.
[43:36.98]Alright, that was fucking fun.
[43:38.48]Okay, it's time to-
[44:02.69]Darn, this is why I fucking... I just fucking... This ad is a full minute.
[44:23.69]Oh, what the fuck?
[44:28.83]I... What?
[44:35.67]Okay, here's... First of all, hold on.
[44:37.89]Somebody gave a bunch of subs.
[44:45.25]Update your flash.
[44:46.33]I don't need to.
[44:47.17]I got the latest version.
[44:48.25]Don't worry.
[44:50.17]Let me get the... Okay.
[44:51.37]Listen.
[44:52.71]This is what you guys picked.
[44:54.01]You picked Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[44:58.67]From Courage the Cowardly Dog Show.
[45:00.03]This is what everybody clicked on.
[45:04.59]Um...
[45:06.42]Making sure that you can't.
[45:09.77]I can click anything else if you want.
[45:11.23]Okay, here we go.
[45:11.75]Courage the Cowardly Dog Nightmare Vacation.
[45:15.97]Evil lava creatures have trapped Muriel under an island volcano.
[45:19.75]Help Courage rescue her.
[45:26.55]Okay.
[45:31.80]Bear Ski Ball.
[45:35.14]Arrow keys in space.
[45:42.74]This is so loud.
[45:49.07]What?
[45:50.23]This feels like an unfinished grid.
[45:57.85]How do I...?
[46:07.11]Why is this game still on their website?
[46:13.60]This game probably has, they probably forgot it existed.
[46:15.82]People saying go down.
[46:50.88]Oh, I wonder.
[46:57.26]Okay.
[47:02.60]I'm not... I'm not gonna... I'm not opening anything else up.
[47:06.62]I'm not gonna open up Facebook.
[47:14.65]Well, that was fun.
[47:15.43]Let's go back to the other games we could play.
[47:19.97]Games, hopefully, that were made in the last 10 to 15 years are clickable, maybe.
[47:24.07]Again, we're going to do it by show.
[47:34.60]So let's go like this.
[47:36.20]Go like that.
[47:38.42]There, that looks better.
[47:39.36]Alright.
[47:50.31]Ed, Edd, and Eddy, here we come.
[48:00.82]Why are people clicking on Courage the Cowardly Dog again?
[48:06.10]Guys.
[48:08.28]What are you thinking?
[48:18.19]You don't really want me to click that again.
[48:22.85]That was a Courage the Cowardly Dog creepypasta.
[48:35.19]Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[48:36.71]Oh, no!
[48:42.78]No, it's because I didn't have the thing on!
[48:44.58]Hold on, that doesn't count, that doesn't count.
[48:46.56]I didn't put on the thing where you can't vote more than once.
[48:57.91]Yeah, fine.
[49:05.30]Guys, can I please start streaming?
[49:28.56]Thank you.
[49:29.36]Thank you, everybody.
[49:38.64]You know, I am just gonna pull... I'll pull up a Ouija board.
[49:42.19]No, that's a bad... That's a biggest mistake I've ever made in my whole life, is pulling up a fucking Ouija board.
[49:51.33]Alright, it's... Ed, Edd n Eddy wins.
[49:53.75]Thank you for participating, everybody.
[50:04.88]Ooh, and we not only have, we have more than a few options here.
[50:09.18]Let me restart it.
[50:19.39]We got Cul-de-sac Smash, Ed Ednetti's Candy Machine, Lunchroom Rumble, or Spin Stadium.
[50:26.35]By the way, the title says Nickelodeon.
[50:40.81]Okay, we've got cul-de-sac smash.
[50:53.04]Got pretty good radio.
[50:54.26]44 million plays.
[50:58.82]Looks like this is going to be the one.
[50:59.70]Let's see how it is.
[51:15.54]Here we go.
[51:18.68]Cul-de-sac smash!
[51:25.13]Okay, instructions.
[51:25.97]Accelerate.
[51:27.37]Let's turn it up a little.
[51:33.37]I can't do this!
[51:35.85]This music is gonna make me fucking scream.
[51:40.51]This is nightmare music.
[51:42.63]Win each derby to advance to the next location.
[51:44.61]I can't even talk.
[51:45.39]I have to take my headphones off.
[51:47.65]Win each derby to advance to the next location.
[51:49.39]Earn cash by competing in the derbies.
[51:51.72]Then make repairs and build new go-karts in the shop.
[51:56.78]In a collision, the faster go-kart does more damage.
[51:58.90]Keep an eye on your damage meter.
[52:01.16]Okay.
[52:02.46]Choose a driver.
[52:03.18]Go ahead.
[52:21.11]Never that as an option.
[52:22.09]Okay, looks like we're gonna be... Ed.
[52:28.03]Alright, Ed.
[52:28.52]To the tournament.
[52:44.53]Uh, this is all locked anyways.
[52:45.97]To the garage.
[52:47.55]Get a dollar for first prize.
[52:49.55]Okay, I'm ready.
[52:50.46]Zippy, pick a go cart.
[52:51.98]Alright.
[52:56.72]That's all I can do, start the derby.
[52:58.68]Here we go!
[53:01.86]This is so loud!
[53:04.14]Oh shit, this is on screen!
[53:12.57]Get off the screen!
[53:17.97]I don't understand what's happening.
[53:32.90]Is it just bumper cars?
[53:38.30]I guess.
[53:47.16]The Rolf is out.
[53:48.34]Alright, I don't know how much I can take this.
[53:55.92]That was fun, alright.
[54:15.55]Okay.
[54:17.11]Uh, that was Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[54:22.13]Thanks for playing Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[54:41.08]Oh, I gotta pee.
[54:42.04]Let me- can I piss?
[54:44.37]I was like rage drinking water.
[54:47.79]I'm gonna pee.
[54:48.53]I'll be right back.
[54:49.95]You gotta keep like clicking on the screen.
[58:50.82]Alright.
[58:54.06]Okay.
[58:56.14]Okay.
[59:00.14]What'd you guys do?
[59:00.98]Oh, you guys circled the toilet real well.
[59:06.56]Alright, let's get away from Cartoon Network, okay?
[59:19.79]Let's go to...
[59:22.08]We're on miniclip.
[59:24.80]Or... This is not gonna even work.
[59:35.30]Is this actually gonna work?
[59:36.34]Okay, it is gonna work.
[59:39.14]But you guys can't even control this.
[59:46.50]Okay, we can all play this.
[59:49.16]You ready?
[59:51.03]I gotta think of a question.
[59:52.07]Hold on.
[59:59.08]This is only gonna work, guys, if we all put our fingers on it.
[60:06.44]So this should work here.
[60:09.57]Okay.
[60:09.87]Let me make this a little bit bigger.
[60:26.37]Alright, that looks alright.
[60:28.78]So the only way a Ouija board works is we all have to hold our hands on it.
[60:43.99]So I'll close that for a second.
[60:45.51]We have to ask it a question.
[60:48.45]So the question is... Um...
[60:58.33]The question is... What's a good question to ask?
[61:06.01]Okay, what's... What's my... What is... My... Uh... What is my... First name?
[61:20.30]Let's see what it does.
[61:21.40]Okay, you guys ready?
[61:22.06]Gotta put your hand on the Ouija.
[61:24.82]Put it on there.
[61:28.96]No.
[61:32.44]No, not... Not... Goodbye.
[61:43.79]Not... Not clear.
[61:52.71]Which one of you guys is doing this?
[61:54.13]Who's doing this?
[61:54.85]What the heck?
[61:57.08]Whoa, this is sick.
[61:57.78]Fuck, what the heck?
[62:00.56]One of you guys is doing this, right?
[62:01.98]Like, one of you guys is touching this, right?
[62:11.06]Hey, that was fun.
[62:11.96]Alright, pick one of these.
[62:25.48]I'm just gonna get as many of them as I can.
[62:28.42]This is, uh... This is Nickelodeon.
[62:31.50]Nickelodeon's hard, because... The website's really not that great.
[62:39.81]So, hold on.
[62:41.19]Let me make this smaller.
[62:46.43]See, the website kind of sucks.
[62:50.24]So, we can't... You guys gotta be really pinpoint on here.
[62:57.52]This is gonna take a lot of accuracy and I gotta zoom in.
[62:59.52]Cause there's no way there's gonna be any accuracy at all.
[63:01.51]Alright.
[63:02.95]I don't know what- there's nothing even in these spaces.
[63:07.13]Okay.
[63:08.83]Uh, here we go.
[63:13.33]Why did I know that was what was gonna happen?
[63:16.93]I knew that was gonna happen.
[63:21.62]What does this do?
[63:26.35]Is this gonna, like, make a fart noise?
[63:27.61]Okay, if this makes a fart noise, then I'm leaving the website.
[63:31.32]I don't care how many fun games are on here.
[63:33.08]Alright, hold on.
[63:39.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[63:40.34]Okay, so I'm obviously gonna click it, but this is more important.
[63:48.01]Okay, here we go.
[63:58.21]Please answer that question, please.
[64:04.23]On your screen right now.
[64:07.49]Will it make a fart noise?
[64:23.52]Well, that's pretty... Alright, let's... Moment of truth.
[64:33.47]That was way more elaborate than just it going like... That's what I thought it was going to do.
[64:49.88]Play... No, I don't want to play Accunator.
[64:55.37]Accunator is... We're just sitting here asking fake genie questions about YouTubers.
[65:02.73]Alright, pick again.
[65:09.95]Oh no, shit.
[65:11.47]No.
[65:14.39]I'm on... I'm on Akinator.
[65:16.59]Whatever.
[65:26.29]Do you guys... You guys want to play a round of Akinator?
[65:29.88]I'm not gonna say anything.
[65:30.92]I'm gonna be silent and you guys have to pick.
[65:43.25]Why do you guys want to click this stupid fucking thing?
[66:03.24]Because it says not to.
[66:13.45]What did you expect?
[66:14.39]Yeah, I know, I'm just kidding around.
[66:15.97]Alright, so let's go, I'll do, let's go to Akinator.
[66:20.35]Give me a second.
[66:31.63]There's absolutely no way that I'll beat Winnie the Pooh baseball.
[66:35.00]Well, I mean, I already did.
[66:40.16]Okay.
[66:41.60]So I need to zoom in for this.
[66:42.76]You guys are going to play this, not me.
[66:43.94]I have nothing to do with this.
[66:45.73]I'm just here in control of the boxes here.
[66:47.59]Okay, so...
[67:07.86]Let me just make sure it is in the right place.
[67:10.48]It is.
[67:11.00]And here you go.
[67:15.63]So, actually I'm going to make this a little bit bigger.
[67:18.25]Because it kind of has to be, right?
[67:40.35]Even bigger than that.
[67:50.08]Even bigger than that!
[67:55.81]Hold on.
[67:58.05]We don't even need the genie here, do we?
[68:00.13]He's like a pretty big deal, isn't he?
[68:01.55]Part of the game.
[68:09.30]You need to be able to see the question, though.
[68:14.12]No, we need him.
[68:16.94]No, you don't.
[68:18.45]There, alright, he's still in it.
[68:22.37]He's still there.
[68:32.30]Alright, here we go.
[68:33.78]Is your character a girl?
[68:36.03]Oh, this didn't really work.
[68:39.69]I'm pretty sure that's a no.
[68:42.39]Yeah, okay, it works.
[68:43.27]No, it works.
[68:43.73]It's pretty... Alright, if I go a little bit... Let me go a little bit higher.
[68:45.65]Hold on.
[68:48.83]There.
[68:49.43]But you guys... You guys can't read that.
[68:52.73]You have to wait till I read the question then.
[68:56.16]Because there's no way we're going to be able to put it all on the screen.
[68:58.00]Alright, that's definitely a no.
[69:01.52]So I'm going to click no.
[69:04.44]Okay.
[69:05.58]Character's not a girl.
[69:08.07]Yeah, but if I read it to you guys, some of you guys are just going to start clicking the screen.
[69:18.13]Alright.
[69:18.71]No, no, no.
[69:19.03]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:19.66]Character's not a girl.
[69:23.38]Is your character really?
[69:25.24]Okay, when I say the question, when I say the question is when you guys can vote.
[69:35.03]Okay?
[69:37.12]Ready?
[69:38.58]Is your character real?
[69:45.24]But how can you guys all play this together when nobody knows what you're even voting for?
[69:56.73]You all have a different character in your head, so how would this make any sense?
[70:02.01]Is your character real?
[70:02.95]Okay, no.
[70:06.70]Okay, hold on.
[70:15.83]So now let me read the next question to you.
[70:18.71]Although you can even see it.
[70:19.51]Is your character from a video game?
[70:25.99]Looks like a majority of you are clicking on yes.
[70:38.56]Okay, so the character's from a video game.
[70:42.64]Already got plenty of clicks.
[70:45.78]Okay, so the character, yes, is from a video game.
[70:49.76]The next one is, does your character use guns?
[71:00.51]I just have 5,000 people in a room.
[71:04.79]I'm just standing on a stage while I point to the screen for you guys.
[71:19.07]Alright, character doesn't... I don't even know who you guys are trying to make.
[71:21.49]Don't tell me who it is, because I don't know who you're trying to make.
[71:23.37]Okay, character does not use guns.
[71:32.43]Does your character wear clothes?
[71:42.88]Okay.

[72:52.10]Okay, no.
[72:54.38]Is your character a skeleton?
[73:14.97]We almost just got sansed right there.
[73:19.59]No, the character is not a skeleton.
[73:25.37]Yeah, according to you guys.
[73:28.57]No.
[73:31.09]Is the character from a horror game?
[73:37.61]Who would be... No, not from a horror game.
[73:49.28]That's a majority no.
[73:53.28]Is your character bad?
[73:56.36]Like a bad guy or what?
[74:04.99]Probably?
[74:05.59]Why are some of you guys putting on probably?
[74:18.14]Seems pretty, you guys seem pretty torn apart on this one.
[74:22.68]Answer is no.

[75:54.84]Uh, is your character an animal?
[76:02.39]That's a hu- that's an overwhelm- no one's even clicking anything else.
[76:05.45]Except for his nose.
[76:15.72]Okay.
[76:20.62]Uh, does your character live with their brother?
[76:25.83]Oh, wait a minute.
[76:26.31]Are you guys doing Pete and Pete on me here?
[76:30.55]That's what you're doing?
[76:31.25]Everyone collectively, all 5,000 of you decided you were going to do Pete and Pete?
[76:35.71]That's pretty... That's a really, really good idea.
[76:38.10]Nice work, guys.
[76:42.52]Oh, no, it's not.
[76:43.40]Doesn't live with the brother.
[76:44.28]Okay.
[76:46.86]Alright.
[76:49.64]Is your character short?
[76:58.38]No.
[77:06.96]No, okay.
[77:08.03]No, the character's not short, so you guys aren't doing like a laugh out loud, let's pick the streamer guy thing, right?

[77:21.13]Blizzard?
[77:29.14]I don't know what you guys are doing, but I don't think, uh... I don't think you guys are on the right track.
[77:39.42]No.
[77:41.46]Do you control your character?
[77:49.48]I love, uh, this is so, this is so fun to me.
[77:53.08]You guys are collectively trying to play Akinator.
[77:57.98]Who knows what the fuck you're gonna... I don't even know.
[78:04.15]You don't control your character.
[78:06.15]No.
[78:09.03]It's not a video game?
[78:09.89]Hold on, how is that not a video game?
[78:10.93]Has your character been in a movie?
[78:19.97]Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[78:21.17]This is yes.
[78:21.71]Is it?
[78:26.84]I don't know what that is.
[78:29.07]Whoa!
[78:29.75]You guys have no idea what you're doing!
[78:31.89]You guys don't- you're not on the same page at all!
[78:34.31]You guys are not on the same page!
[78:40.88]That's so even!
[78:42.16]That is scarily even.
[78:51.57]Okay, apparently it's no.
[78:55.37]No.
[78:56.17]Your character has... has not been in a movie.
[79:02.80]Is your character known for their lips?
[79:06.14]What does that mean?
[79:15.04]I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[79:19.10]Okay.
[79:20.64]No.
[79:25.31]What is this?
[79:26.34]Okay, no.
[79:31.92]Is that no?
[79:37.69]That looks pretty no to me down here.
[79:44.51]I can't tell the split if there is a split.
[79:47.84]There might be a split here.
[79:55.44]I need to reset and enhance this.
[79:56.91]Click a little bit lower guys, I can't, I don't know what it is.
[79:58.89]I'm gonna reset it.
[80:07.95]Oh shit, it's no.
[80:09.06]That's a big no.
[80:11.30]No, no, no.
[80:21.83]Okay.
[80:22.71]Uh, who did you make?
[80:25.68]He's got even more- I thought it was 20 questions!
[80:27.42]What's with the more than 21?
[80:30.52]Is your character in a team of four?
[80:32.48]What?
[80:36.69]How many questions is he allowed to ask?
[80:42.81]No, he's not in a team of four.
[80:46.47]As many as he needs to.
[80:47.87]Okay, not in a team of four.
[80:53.11]Has my character ever gone on tour?
[80:57.25]I don't know what that means.
[81:01.81]No.
[81:15.04]Wait, there's a lot of people that don't know.
[81:20.63]Yes, no, don't know, probably.
[81:22.95]You guys are all over the place.
[81:31.54]I think we might have to enhance.
[81:33.64]Yeah.
[81:36.98]Just for this question, I gotta pull this up a little.
[81:46.37]Do it again.
[81:51.75]Don't!
[81:52.44]No.
[82:09.75]Well, I... Don't know.
[82:14.95]Oh, you did know?
[82:15.65]Don't know.
[82:18.89]Why is my BRB screen still on?
[82:22.09]Okay.
[82:23.27]Don't know if he's ever gone on tour.
[82:24.51]This next question is... Is your character linked with Undertale?
[82:38.71]No.
[82:51.51]Okay, not linked with Undertale.
[82:55.91]Is your character heavily muscular?
[82:58.76]Heavily muscular.
[83:10.54]Yes!
[83:11.24]Alright, I think I know what you guys are doing now.
[83:17.51]I think I know what you guys are doing.
[83:22.58]This next one is, actually I can probably shrink this a little bit so you can see the question.
[83:31.78]No, it's too hard.
[83:32.96]Alright, can we get Mr. Genie out of here?
[83:41.35]Okay, there we go.
[83:43.73]Is your character from the Fallout series?
[83:56.63]Somebody came in and said, oh, you guys are still playing this.
[84:05.94]No, it's not from Fallout.
[84:07.90]We're at question 25.
[84:09.20]I think it's Bowler from Clash of Clans.
[84:15.63]Is this who you guys were doing?
[84:17.47]Is this what you were making?
[84:23.85]Bowler from Clash of Clans.
[84:36.52]Uh, I don't think I... What were you guys going for?
[84:39.38]You wanted Glue Man.
[84:40.41]I mean, that's kind of close.
[84:48.57]That's actually pretty close.
[84:54.63]You're wrong, though.
[84:55.69]I am wrong.
[84:57.79]Continue.
[85:04.62]That's eerily close, though.
[85:05.98]That's so funny.
[85:06.64]Hold on.
[85:12.59]Okay.
[85:13.17]Do you speak with your character?
[85:21.59]And make sure when you're clicking, make sure your clicks are pinpoint accuracy.
[85:25.78]That way we get to keep the genie on screen.
[85:31.18]Okay.
[85:31.50]Do you speak with your character?
[85:32.64]No.
[85:33.04]Apparently not.
[85:40.30]I think he's broken.
[85:44.54]Well, did he skip like five questions?
[85:48.40]What was that?
[85:48.82]Weren't we just on question like 23?
[85:56.57]Is your character from a large family?
[86:04.15]Yeah, I don't know.
[86:05.39]Probably.
[86:06.73]No.
[86:13.70]Do I need to enhance this?
[86:18.92]I might have to enhance this.
[86:22.11]Looks like it's mostly on no.
[86:30.71]That actually makes it a little easier.
[86:34.23]There we go.
[86:34.87]Okay.
[86:35.15]Alright, let's try it again.
[86:47.04]This looks like don't know.
[86:57.94]Nose.
[86:59.98]The nose has not won.
[87:02.20]It's don't know.
[87:02.74]Okay, don't know.
[87:10.12]Does your character go pearl diving?
[87:19.00]Pearl diving.
[87:20.50]Is it like a cartoon character that dives for pearls?
[87:23.00]That's a lot of don't knows and no's.
[87:30.69]You guys are trying so very hard for this.
[87:34.37]So very hard!
[87:37.83]It's either no or don't know.
[87:39.02]That's too close to call.
[87:40.10]That's like a 30-30 split.
[87:41.98]That's like 33-33.
[87:46.52]And some of you guys clicking on the no's are not participating.
[87:54.44]I'm gonna say that's don't no.
[87:57.88]Or no.
[87:58.32]Yeah, look at the circle here.
[87:59.82]Yeah, that's no.
[88:05.92]Does your character eat pickles?
[88:14.46]This doesn't do anything.
[88:20.85]Probably I thought you guys are making Glue Man.
[88:26.01]Why does Glue Man probably eat pickles?
[88:35.09]Okay That's what it is Probably okay Is your character an alien?
[88:55.74]no that's a no look at that I mean it's split a little bit but that's I would say that's a no let me go like I'm just gonna read the questions for you guys we'll keep his nose on screen

[89:38.08]Is your character an alien?
[89:38.90]The character's not an alien.
[89:47.36]Now I have to read this question before it even clicks anything.
[89:50.41]That's why I'm turning it off.
[89:53.94]Does your character wear armor?
[90:00.76]Really, guys?
[90:01.42]100% of you?
[90:10.34]No, he doesn't.

[90:57.89]Is your character your own flesh and blood?
[91:07.85]How would it guess your son?
[91:20.86]Wow.
[91:23.69]This is pretty even.
[91:25.15]If only one out of every five of you didn't click on the nose, we'd have a better indicator of what this is.
[91:43.42]Alright, do it again.
[91:44.36]This time, I want the one out of five of you to answer.
[91:52.29]Is your character your own flesh and blood?

[99:50.29]Close this up.
[99:52.66]And this.
[99:56.16]Back to Nickelodeon.
[99:57.14]Let's make this better on the screen.
[100:07.18]Alright, which Nickelodeon game do you want me to play?
[100:16.87]Go play Chess.
[100:20.98]That would be impossible.
[100:22.07]That's not going to be possible.
[100:28.49]Do you know how that's not even going to work?
[100:32.11]How are you supposed to... You guys have to select a unit, and then I have to do another poll and select where the unit goes.
[100:42.64]Oh my lord, that's going to be unbearable.
[100:45.02]Alright, let's do it.
[100:45.60]Alright, we're doing SpongeBob Surf Cell.
[100:54.01]It's gonna be loud.
[101:00.83]This is such a tiny screen.
[101:10.80]Select game mode.
[101:20.06]Well, you guys are not clicking in an accurate manner.
[101:31.97]The seagull.
[101:33.17]Alright, looks like I'm gonna be SpongeBob.
[101:39.85]Select a board.
[101:41.58]Well, it has to be the ice cream cone.
[101:45.06]Who are these characters?
[101:45.92]No, I gotta be SpongeBob.
[101:49.00]Select chorus.
[102:11.12]Alright, looks like we're going here.
[102:19.57]Okay.
[102:24.37]Easy peasy, normal or hard.
[102:30.92]Play checkers?
[102:31.52]We'll play checkers and we'll play chess.
[102:38.40]Hard.
[102:38.74]Alright, here we go.
[102:40.28]How to play.
[102:42.94]Move and space the jump.
[102:43.96]Avoid the break.
[102:44.84]This is fucking killing my ears.
[102:47.79]Okay.
[102:48.99]Let's go.
[103:00.69]I don't understand.
[103:01.19]I don't get it.
[103:01.75]Okay, there we go.
[103:04.05]Go up!
[103:10.70]That- it doesn't- I don't- this doesn't work!
[103:17.60]Okay, so it's not just up and down on the arrow keys.
[103:24.68]Go for the jump.
[103:31.83]Nice, I got an achievement.
[103:35.95]Alright, let's play checkers.
[104:00.01]Let me zoom in so you get a good view of this.
[104:04.33]And you guys can actually pick.
[104:10.38]This is going to be, give me a second.
[104:11.54]This is going to take a second to get this the way that I want it.
[104:18.56]Let me see if that, did that work?
[104:20.95]Kind of.
[104:28.67]Alright, let me make sure it's good, and then I'm gonna stretch it out.
[104:37.63]This is gonna be really, really ugly, but, you know, we kinda have to do what we gotta do here.
[104:43.34]Okay.
[104:44.38]Are you guys ready?
[104:44.84]You guys ready to play Checkers?
[105:03.27]You want me to mute it?
[105:08.01]Why am I muting the sound?
[105:13.82]Why would you want me to mute the sound?
[105:18.26]Versus, uh, bot.
[105:21.70]Holy fuck, this is ugly.
[105:22.84]Hold on.
[105:37.22]This has to be stretched.
[105:42.58]Okay.
[105:44.22]Make sure you're very accurate.
[105:45.70]So the goal here, the goal here is to make sure the first thing you pick first, the one that you want to move, then the next one after that is where you're moving it to.
[106:01.95]Okay.
[106:06.22]So pick the one that you'd like to move.
[106:08.98]Us versus you.

[157:07.95]As the pitcher winds up, a marker appears showing where the ball will pass.
[157:12.19]Use the mouse to mouse the aim circle towards the marker.
[157:15.88]The closer you are, the straighter you are.
[157:18.66]Okay.
[157:19.02]You can control the direction by moving the aim circle relative to the marker.

[157:26.80]Up aim.
[157:27.50]That's up.

[160:35.86]Why?
[160:39.19]Oh, that's what he says!
[160:40.65]And then they fucking leave the infield.
[160:43.00]I'm out of here.
