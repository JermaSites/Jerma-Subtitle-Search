[00:00.24]Well, this is it.
[00:02.65]My chance to finally become a cop.
[00:06.19]Yep.
[00:13.99]Hey.
[00:15.99]Hey.
[00:18.01]Hey!
[00:19.36]What are you doing out here?
[00:21.38]The cop station doesn't open till morning.
[00:23.32]You're gonna have to wait a while, sonny.
[00:29.30]Okay, off you go.
[00:38.22]Hello.
[00:39.46]Hi.
[00:40.80]I was just wondering if I could be a cop.
[00:44.43]You?
[00:45.51]You're a little pipsqueak.
[00:48.53]Come on.
[00:49.99]Oh, lookie here, boys.
[00:51.25]This guy thinks he can be a cop.
[00:54.01]He probably sucks somebody's dick.
[00:58.52]Okay, alright, you can be a cop if you can tell me what this is.
[01:04.10]It's a hand grenade.
[01:06.90]Uh, what, no?
[01:08.76]No, this is a, um, this is actually a, uh, actually, you know what, you just got lucky.
[01:15.11]Okay, smarty pants, how do you use it then, huh?
[01:21.69]You idiot, we're all gonna die!
[01:27.79]What the?
[01:29.51]Oh.
[01:31.09]So that's how you use those things.
[01:32.77]Oh, well, I didn't know that.
[01:38.15]What the hell is going on?
[01:40.74]There's no time to explain, boy.
[01:42.22]If you must know, we have to go save an old lady down the street who's being held up by a criminal who's going to take her purse.
[01:50.14]Which means if we don't get down there right away, she could be killed.
[01:53.71]What?
[01:54.89]Quick, to the Super Speedwagon 3000!
[01:56.87]What's the holdup?
[01:58.37]It don't seem to be starting up there, Sarge.
[02:00.83]What?
[02:01.21]You're joking, right?
[02:18.28]Yeah, I wish I was there, Sarge, but no.
[02:20.92]No jokin'.
[02:22.26]Goddammit, did you check the gas bill, you fuckin' retard?
[02:26.46]Yeah, that's not the problem.
[02:29.20]Shit.
[02:30.12]We'll never make it in time.
[02:38.28]Just walk!
[02:40.48]Yes, but we'll never make it from here if we just walk!
[02:44.26]Okay, trainee.
[02:46.00]You can push us to the crime scene.
[02:49.31]Did you understand what I said to you?
[02:51.51]We will never make it in time.
[02:53.05]Now get out and push, or so help me God, your testicles are going to be cut off!
[02:59.44]To the crime scene!
[03:06.84]I think we're a little too late here, Sarge.
[03:09.53]Well, she seems fine to me.
[03:14.31]Look at her.
[03:16.30]Oh, I'm just fine and dandy.
[03:19.88]Just a little knock on the head.
[03:23.84]Thanks for saving me, police officers.
[03:26.89]And oh my, look at the penis on this one.
[03:30.41]He's just got a big penis, alright, and I would love to sleep with him.
[03:35.23]Uh, old age, I guess.
[03:40.55]Hey, the wagon's working, Sarge.
[03:43.53]Huzzah!
