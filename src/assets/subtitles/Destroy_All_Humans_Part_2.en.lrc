[00:38.68]Let me change the title.
[00:39.86]I'm going to keep the title that I had two nights ago because I liked that title.
[00:50.17]I like to get rid of everybody.
[00:52.33]That was a good title.
[00:53.95]It should not be E3 anymore.
[00:56.56]Why are you doing this, man?
[01:04.69]Apparently, I can't update my stream title.
[01:07.13]So people think I'm still doing E3 stuff.
[01:09.14]Try it one more time.
[01:10.82]And then it's gonna have to stay as the E3 title, I guess.
[01:35.87]Well, it changed for a second.
[01:40.55]There we go.
[01:40.81]Alright, let's play.
[01:42.96]Destroy all humans.
[01:47.70]We left off.
[01:48.68]I'm going to have to give a fair warning here.
[01:51.26]That we're going to start to see internet problems in like another hour or two.
[01:56.47]So we'll go as long as I can.
[01:58.81]As long as I can do this, I will do it.

[02:10.05]I'm not sure, did it complete? Did we- do I actually beat it?
[02:14.05]I think I did. Let's take a look at the lab. Laboratory!
[02:23.05]Maybe I gave on Microsoft a lot of like we all did but you know they're trying. It's just really here's the thing:
[02:32.90]The whole we're acquiring studios thing, that's not...
[02:38.00]Okay, that's like going out with somebody and you're at dinner, right?
[02:43.22]You go to dinner with whoever you're at dinner with and somebody orders: this.
[02:48.27]Oh I'm gonna order a cheeseburger.
[02:49.27]Okay that's cool, whatever man.
[02:51.27]Yeah I'm gonna get um- I'm gonna get a chicken wrap that sounds good. Crispy chicken wrap - does that come with fries?
[02:57.27]Yeah it does. What are you gonna order?
[02:59.27]And the person just decide- you know- you know I feel like the filet mignon and a lobster uh so I'm gonna order that. I'm gonna order two of them. I want two lobsters and two filet mignons for lunch.
[03:10.27]And everybody kind of looks around like: Okay dude, you got a lot of fucking money, that's great, good to know.
[03:15.37]It's like that's what Microsoft is just like telling everybody, hey, we got a bunch of money, isn't that interesting?
[03:19.74]Don't you like that?
[03:20.46]Don't you guys like money?
[03:23.62]Look what I bought today.
[03:25.62]Like flaunts out like a huge, that's the guy that shows you his Rolex.

[03:38.87]It's true.
[03:40.31]Alright, let's go to the lab.
[03:42.49]I want to see what's available for upgrades.
[03:45.56]Nothing.
[03:46.95]At least not yet.
[03:50.79]Back to the hangar.
[03:55.73]Good one, Jerby.
[03:56.39]It's a waste, man.
[03:57.53]Bad stuff, man.

[04:21.39]I didn't even have my stream lives open.
[04:24.48]First up, I want you to find the alpha male of this town.
[04:28.44]Also need to remember the controls.
[04:29.60]Perhaps we can gain an insight into the way this whacked human social hierarchy functions.
[04:36.78]Okay, finally alpha male.
[04:37.66]Mm-hmm.
[04:38.44]Oh, shit.

[05:54.72]I don't know.
[05:55.71]Alright, hold on.
[05:56.49]The stream lab needs to pop out.
[06:00.15]There we go.
[06:00.79]Now I can play the game.
[06:03.71]The game is playable now.
[06:05.15]Sorry.
[06:07.21]Sorry.
[06:11.45]Here we go.
[06:12.17]One, two, three.
[06:14.67]The way... Because I was watching E3.
[06:16.43]It was fairly impossible for me to get that correct.
[06:21.49]I had to switch monitors.
[06:25.05]There we go.
[06:26.15]Done for good.
[06:26.81]Let's go.
[06:30.69]This is the guy I need to disguise as.
[06:40.15]Maybe I'll get lucky at the pool party.
[06:42.69]Meet some sexy single ladies.
[06:44.67]Get a little action.
[06:46.15]Good thing I wore my date night jockeys.
[06:49.01]So this is the alpha?
[06:53.01]Wouldn't the alpha male be saying something weird like that?
[06:56.62]Bring it on, bad guys.
[06:58.36]I'm going all Joe Friday.
[07:00.96]I have a dragnet out for evildoers.
[07:05.22]Go to the mayor.
[07:05.96]Distraction.
[07:06.62]Go to the mayor.
[07:11.35]I need to... I need brain fluid.
[07:13.41]Come on.
[07:13.57]Head to the mayor.
[07:28.42]There are a lot of people walking around.
[07:30.88]I have an opportunity.
[07:31.60]Don't get hit by a car like I did last time.
[07:33.60]You have too many thoughts on your mind.
[07:35.44]I don't want to hear it.
[07:36.28]Where is this guy going?
[07:37.60]Are we going to the pool party together?
[07:53.08]What's wrong with him?
[07:54.61]Scan the mayor.
[07:55.29]No police awareness.
[07:55.71]Good.
[08:09.64]Get out of the way.
[08:12.86]If only there were some way to electronically facilitate the private viewing of illicit photography.
[08:17.41]I keep fucking with the mayor.
[08:18.81]I predict it will happen in the... You think as much power as I've got in this town, I could ban these stupid pool parties.
[08:25.07]No, don't anal probe the mayor.
[08:26.13]I'm trying to drink.
[08:29.59]This mayor is pathetic.
[08:32.36]So is this pool party.
[08:34.90]It's time to trash the place.
[08:37.06]Clear the pool party area of humans.
[08:40.17]How am I supposed to trust the place?
[08:45.67]I guess I could hypnotize the mayor.
[08:47.19]You do not just say that.
[08:50.15]Lead everyone from the party.
[08:51.67]Distraction.
[08:52.38]Lead everyone from the party.
[08:53.44]I'm drinking.
[08:57.38]I'm currently drinking iced tea right now.
[08:59.12]I'm fine.
[09:14.76]The mayor sounds like me.
[09:17.84]I mean, he sounds like JFK.
[09:23.88]Alright, what's the goal here?
[09:27.75]Lead them away from the party.
[09:29.17]I did.
[09:29.57]I need to trash the place?
[09:31.15]How am I supposed to destroy these people without being seen?
[09:32.93]Oh, shit.
[09:37.29]Okay, hold on.
[09:40.49]Can I blow him up?
[09:41.31]Alright, this is obviously, like, a gas.
[09:43.90]Okay, hold on.
[09:44.88]Scan this guy.
[09:45.46]Are they gonna know it's me?
[09:46.24]Okay.
[10:03.00]That didn't get anybody.
[10:04.98]That didn't get anybody.
[10:07.32]What?
[10:07.62]I just... Oh my god.
[10:08.44]Why would that not hurt somebody?
[10:10.08]I don't understand why that wouldn't kill somebody.
[10:13.07]Easy.
[10:36.08]Well, I guess we have to keep going over here.
[10:41.79]He ran this way.
[10:44.91]He's right over here.
[10:45.83]Do I kill the mayor?
[10:53.22]I think I killed the mayor.
[10:59.04]Oh, well.
[10:59.42]He's dead.
[11:10.86]I just have to kill everybody now.
[11:11.94]Well, didn't it say if somebody saw me, I would lose?
[11:14.16]I got crashed.
[11:31.62]Look at that DNA.
[11:37.98]Like, where did the people... There's two out of eight, I don't understand.
[11:48.52]Like, what did I do wrong?
[11:49.50]Ugh.
[12:00.27]and destroy them all.
[12:01.79]I was just, I thought I was gonna fail the mission if somebody saw through my disguise, like I said in the beginning.
[12:09.05]There's one fucking guy at the pool party still dancing.
[12:11.27]Was it this guy?
[12:13.33]Are you kidding me?

[16:22.11]Yeah, right, it is.
[16:22.87]The sync is not right.

[17:28.94]You want to see me with a beard?
[17:29.98]It's impossible.
[17:30.74]I can't do it.
[17:39.85]Alright, go to the mothership.
[17:43.95]That lady just got hit by the fucking truck.
[17:47.57]Time to move.
[17:53.45]1175 DNA, let's just go to the next mission.

[18:04.16]So tomorrow is Sony, right?
[18:07.52]Then after that, Tuesday's Nintendo.
[18:10.76]I'm trying to get something to happen by Nintendo's stream.
[18:15.01]Those of you that were in chat last night, yesterday afternoon.
[18:17.59]You might see something real weird on Tuesday.
[18:22.17]I don't know, I'm gonna try.
[18:22.91]I have this.
[18:24.75]Nothing.
[18:25.19]What about the shift?
[18:26.05]Should I be photoshopping beards on myself?
[18:39.85]I mean, I could paint a beard on me so you can see what it looks like.
[18:42.47]It's gonna look awful.
[18:46.19]Did I get the green light?
[18:47.05]I got the green light.
[18:50.49]I did.
[18:54.77]I got the green light with some stipulations.
[18:57.75]But I need to get that together in less than 48 hours.
[19:00.41]So it's gonna be fucking extremely hard.
[19:05.44]You can just pretend.
[19:06.46]Those of you that were there, we don't have to give any...
[19:09.89]I don't have to give any spoilers.
[19:14.73]They don't look so tough.
[19:17.39]Looks can deceive.
[19:19.47]These urban humans are savvier.
[19:21.61]Green light for a really, really terrible stream idea.
[19:25.41]Harder to fool.
[19:26.95]Keep your eyes sharp and your wits sharper.
[19:30.11]But don't expect it because a lot could go wrong.

[20:06.38]I think we're doing it next week.
[20:07.34]Something like that.
[20:09.96]Wait, let me grab something to write with.
[20:13.90]If our plan is to succeed, simply reading human minds will be insufficient.
[20:18.83]We must control them.
[20:21.41]To ease the harvesting of their brain stems, grease the wheels, so to speak.
[20:26.42]Sounds like a gas.
[20:28.58]How do we do it?
[20:30.11]I believe your ebongarbed friends have provided us direction.
[20:35.43]So I got a new item here?

[22:35.79]Just picking people up and throwing them.
[22:37.57]Oh wait, I need more brain juice.
[22:38.81]Hold on.
[22:41.07]Alright, I'm having too much fun.

[23:11.86]I can't even do that thing.
[23:26.04]Oh, what?
[23:26.86]I'm gonna get up here.
[23:37.45]This thing's probably the best weapon so far.
[23:40.87]Can I get in there or do I have to wrap around here?
[23:44.99]There it is.
[23:50.18]Extract brains?
[23:51.32]Yeah, that's true.
[23:52.14]I really do need to extract brains.
[23:54.36]Haven't been doing that.
[23:59.97]Whoa, fuck!
[24:00.51]Alright, I gotta hide.
[24:04.11]I don't want that to go... That guy can't wake up, right?
[24:09.83]Alright, we're good.
[24:17.07]I'm gonna disguise as him and then scan him.
[24:23.83]Soon I'll prove the human mind can be controlled by televised propaganda.
[24:27.97]And then I'll start my own cable news network.
[24:30.67]Ha ha!
[24:31.69]Where's the heck are those majestic agents?
[24:34.03]America ain't gonna brainwash itself.

[24:41.15]What's the Duck Professor?
[24:42.35]Donald Duck's like Professor Uncle... I wanna ride a motorcycle.
[24:47.64]How come I never get to ride a motorcycle?
[24:49.58]Destroy Sleepy Ernest.
[24:50.28]Motorcycle cops have all the fun.
[24:53.41]Professor Von Drake, that's his name.
[24:55.49]Alright, I need to just kill this guy.
[25:01.25]What's going on there?
[25:04.56]We better make sure his work is destroyed.
[25:10.82]Why would you sleep next to a gas tank?
[25:12.92]Believe me, I know.
[25:14.38]It's no fun being an illegal alien.
[25:16.28]You want a piece of me?
[25:19.46]I think I'm going to sleep.
[25:20.20]Next to a fucking volatile gas tank.
[25:21.10]Destroy the car.
[25:22.50]Pull it in.
[25:22.88]Alright, into the ocean, come on.
[25:25.66]Three, two, one, action!
[25:52.66]Not dead.
[25:57.42]Alright, I got it.
[26:18.40]God dammit, the water doesn't destroy the car.
[26:20.48]What the fuck was that?
[26:21.80]Why was that house a giant grenade?
[26:48.35]Don't even give me the 4000 IQ bullshit.
[26:50.76]Those were rusty old barrels.
[26:52.76]Those weren't like bright red explosion barrels.
[26:58.31]I was gonna pick a barrel up and throw it at one of the guys.
[27:00.95]Oh my god.
[27:01.63]We have to do that all over again.
[27:08.50]That house is made out of fireworks.
[27:20.77]They were still barreled.
[27:21.57]You always have to assume that every barrel in every video game is explosive.
[27:27.93]Yeah, only red barrels can explode.
[27:30.13]We're all video gamers here.
[27:31.29]Let's destroy the car again.
[27:38.75]Make this easy.
[27:39.35]Look out!
[27:46.72]I just hit myself with the fucking car.
[27:55.44]Explode!
[27:56.60]Fuck, I can't... Well, they're not going anywhere, that's certain.
[28:08.12]I need to scan somebody's brain, quick!
[28:10.07]My brain is getting weaker.
[28:13.25]There we go.
[28:21.06]Okay, now scan brain.
[28:23.26]These guys aren't going anywhere, they can't move.
[28:24.88]Oh boy, that Ike.
[28:26.98]You sure could barbecue with him.
[28:28.62]Wait, why is this thing on fire?
[28:30.84]The barbecuing president.
[28:32.75]Now that's a platform for election.
[28:40.10]Now they're on fire?
[28:42.26]Wait, why is the cop car on fire?
[28:49.29]Alright, just get rid of the damn thing.
[28:51.39]Enough of this.
[28:51.97]Oh my god.
[29:08.56]I love the people that just get run over.
[29:11.72]Come here!
[29:12.26]Scan!
[29:12.66]These guys have been on fire for a full two minutes.
[29:19.71]Get the briefcase.
[29:29.95]Alright, collect the briefcase.
[29:31.37]Run away.
[29:31.93]Go to Elbertson.
[29:33.28]Crypto, this looks diabolical.
[29:37.52]The briefcase contains a reel of magnetic tape and orders to commence an experiment in human mind control.
[29:45.54]Apparently, a human scientist is waiting at the TV station for these orders.
[29:51.37]He's an expert on the human brain.
[29:54.25]His name is...
[29:58.47]Sleepy Ernst!
[30:00.39]I want you to go to the TV station and scan Sleepy Ernst!
[30:03.57]Let's see if I can hit him with this.
[30:05.25]So we can get a Tomahawk across the whole map in Nuke Town.
[30:07.64]Here we go.
[30:10.31]No.
[30:16.79]I don't even know why.
[30:17.99]Wait, I thought I threw that right in front of me.
[30:19.98]Apparently not.
[30:21.34]That dramatic pause.
[30:37.50]Can I hypnotize this guy to let me in?
[30:40.28]Give me ten fingers, dude.
[30:44.03]Alright, scan.
[30:44.83]Yeah, there he is.
[30:45.99]Let's kill him a different way now.
[30:50.54]Let's kill him with a cardboard box.
[30:52.64]Look at how many things that they're trying.
[30:56.07]Wait, there's an electrical thing there, too.
[30:59.35]What do you think?
[31:00.35]Cardboard box?
[31:00.93]Go away, electricity?
[31:01.63]Why do these guys keep running over here?
[31:03.79]Why?
[31:04.07]Drop the car on him?
[31:04.85]I could cardboard box him.
[31:18.94]We cannot allow the human race to be Sleepy Ernest's experimental Guinea pigs.
[31:24.54]They should be our Guinea pigs.
[31:25.24]Yeah, I wasn't just gonna kill him.
[31:26.14]I'm not gonna just kill him.
[31:29.14]I just kill him.
[31:29.92]That would be such a disaster.
[31:31.15]Alright, destroy Sleepy Ernest.
[31:38.11]Let's pick up a cardboard box.
[31:45.15]That's a badge, Biatch!
[31:49.59]This is like playing the claw machine, seriously.
[32:16.59]I got him.
[32:16.91]Did I?
[32:17.05]How do they not see me doing this?
[32:19.25]Okay, here we go.
[32:19.93]Okay, I don't care.
[32:42.35]How do they not know it's me doing this?
[32:43.77]How would you not know this?
[32:44.99]Yo, yo, yo
[33:09.09]Okay, get destroyed.
[33:13.21]There we are.
[33:18.65]Majestic intended to broadcast mind control signals to control their own people.
[33:24.45]By transmitting signals from this station, they hope to make the human population paranoid and aggressive.
[33:32.07]Well, more paranoid and aggressive.
[33:35.06]I suggest we beat Majestic at their own devious little game.
[33:39.30]Just like Hitman, they don't know it's me.
[33:41.38]Get away from those tinted barrels, you idiot.
[33:45.12]Don't n- I would have been so fucking angry if I killed myself there.
[33:48.80]A few minor adjustments to those rooftop antennae should make them Furon ready.
[33:54.20]I'm sure you can handle that.
[33:56.88]I gotta sneak around the back here.
[33:57.76]Alright, take off the disguise, jump over the gate, scan, steal.
[34:14.08]Oh, come on, man.
[34:17.98]He's dead.
[34:19.38]Shit.
[34:19.98]I'm in trouble.
[34:26.30]I didn't really want to do that, but it's okay.
[34:32.13]There you go.
[34:32.63]Disguise.
[34:33.97]Come on, guy in the red shirt.
[34:34.89]Disguise is this guy.
[34:35.71]Come on.
[34:38.10]Safe.
[34:41.98]I can't pick up the DNA when I'm a person?
[34:43.88]Oh well.
[34:47.92]There it is.
[34:48.28]There.
[34:48.52]Get to the roof.
[34:51.25]Just don't be spotted by any humans.
[34:58.84]You didn't see anything.
[34:59.84]Give me your head so I can scan.
[35:01.32]There we go.
[35:01.74]No, you fucking idiot.
[35:03.68]Come on.
[35:09.83]Okay.
[35:11.63]Get on the roof.
[35:15.13]This is not a roof.
[35:18.76]Alright, Crypto.
[35:19.92]Here's the plan.
[35:21.38]We're going to use this television thingy ourselves to subjugate humanity to the indomitable will of the Furon Empire!
[35:33.87]If you can bend the antennae in the direction of the mothership, they'll be in the perfect position to receive my Furon mind control transformations.
[35:43.10]That's the good news.
[35:45.95]Okay.
[35:46.05]Ahh.
[35:46.13]Bend the antenna.
[35:46.95]Alright, we got one right here.
[35:47.99]Use PK to bend all the antennas.
[35:49.64]Okay, I can use PK.
[36:16.88]That is one.
[36:18.22]I'm just going to go for a rooftop hops here.
[36:20.94]Forget about fighting anybody.
[36:21.90]Bend it.
[36:27.80]Bend it.
[36:33.52]Across the way.
[36:34.74]I only got two minutes to do this.
[36:36.14]Go, man.
[36:36.80]Hurry up.
[36:40.02]I'm going to run out of time.
[36:43.98]I'm going to run out of time.
[36:53.90]Forget about everything else.
[36:54.76]Just bend these damn things.
[36:55.92]Hurry.
[36:56.32]There's one right here too.
[37:03.89]Fuck.
[37:05.63]Bad route.
[37:06.49]Bad routing.
[37:08.17]Bad planning.
[37:16.77]Did I get it?
[37:17.29]Yeah.
[37:17.75]Terrible route.
[37:18.31]Terrible routing.
[37:18.95]This is going to be actually kind of close.
[37:20.69]This is going to be close.
[37:21.51]Good route.
[37:21.87]Over here first.
[37:51.81]Last one.
[37:53.91]Full 60 seconds, we're good.
[37:54.93]Where's that spider?
[37:56.33]I just completely forgot about him.
[38:02.40]Price is pretty good.
[38:04.74]Nine.
[38:07.58]Are aliens furries?
[38:08.54]No, they're not animals.
[38:11.09]Wait, is a person a furry?
[38:13.41]I guess, wait.
[38:14.07]Humans are animals.
[38:15.09]Aren't they?
[38:16.15]I'm going to blow all their brains out, aren't I?
[38:36.00]Quickly, Crypto!
[38:37.08]You've got to bend the antennae before they... That has to hurt.
[38:42.67]We just did DK mode.
[38:47.31]Remember DK mode?
[38:50.73]Crypto!
[38:51.77]Where did you go?
[38:52.69]I mean, aliens are technically animals.
[39:06.44]Why do they have green brains?
[39:09.62]It's because they get pumped full of alien juices.
[39:14.47]Freak lightning strikes entire block.
[39:15.89]Kills 10.
[39:16.59]Local electrician to answer in court for faulty ground wiring.
[39:23.15]When you're ready.
[39:24.93]Alright, I got some... Let's see.
[39:26.45]Let's do this one.
[39:27.29]Let's try one of the side missions.
[39:31.59]To avoid the M rating.
[39:32.95]That's true.
[39:37.88]That's so funny that all it takes to avoid an M rating is... Yeah, but their heads are exploding.
[39:44.82]Blood is pouring out of their head sockets.
[39:47.84]But the brain is green!
[39:50.92]It's for kids!
[39:53.64]Those wacky teenagers!
[40:06.30]Bethesda's playing?
[40:07.94]No, it's not.
[40:08.64]What do you mean Bethesda's currently playing?
[40:12.70]What?
[40:12.88]I thought Bethesda's later tonight.
[40:22.49]Somebody lied to me.
[40:24.75]Crush the spirit of the humans by destroying their precious females.
[40:27.29]Destroy 12 female humans.
[40:31.20]Okay.
[40:32.04]Let's do it.
[40:34.20]One minute.
[40:34.56]Two.
[40:38.63]Three.
[40:38.81]Four.
[40:39.09]Five.
[40:40.03]Six.
[40:40.57]Seven.
[40:41.39]Oh, there's a lot over here.
[41:01.58]10, 11, 12.
[41:01.82]Right here.
[41:02.66]Got it.
[41:05.00]Got them.
[41:07.88]When you're ready, let's go back to the gym.
[41:16.32]Any new unlockables?
[41:20.52]I love that scream.
[41:22.20]I wish I had that scream.
[41:24.53]If I see a spider in the house or if a mouse runs by or... Stab my toe.
[41:29.54]The dentist pulls out the wrong tooth.
[41:31.12]You know, fall down a 200-foot cliff.
[41:36.56]Eyes gouge out of my skull.
[41:37.86]I wish that was my scream.
[41:42.27]Orthopox has researched a new upgrade.
[41:49.55]What is it?
[41:50.47]Not this.
[41:51.49]Disintegrate array.
[41:51.95]Increase ammo capacity and fire rate.
[41:54.09]Definitely.
[41:54.51]We got $50.
[41:54.77]50 bucks just came in.
[42:16.93]I haven't got all day to sit around.
[42:19.03]I have to plan the destruction of humanity.
[42:20.75]Did that even show up on screen?
[42:22.51]Yeah, it did.
[42:22.83]Okay.
[42:24.39]Thank you so much, Stormy2, for the 5,000 bits.
[42:27.11]$50.
[42:27.87]And they say, Pride 5,000, your commentary is the best in Destroy All Humans, has brought me back some good memories.
[42:38.32]Anyways, do you think you could survive an alien invasion?
[42:40.72]Yes.
[42:42.74]Listen to me.
[42:44.06]This is a foolproof plan.
[42:46.96]You ever see any of the data or any of the articles that have been written about alien invasions?
[42:52.10]Number one thing they say is cats are going to survive.
[42:56.37]Cats and birds.
[42:57.99]Because why is that?
[42:59.65]They're in the trees.
[43:01.15]Cats climb up the trees.
[43:02.31]Birds stay in the trees.
[43:04.63]Cats will survive an apocalyptic situation.
[43:07.07]So what I would do is everyone wants to go underneath.
[43:09.92]Everyone wants to build a bunker.
[43:11.56]To go down.
[43:12.88]No, no, no, no.
[43:13.50]What happens when the soil starts to degrade?
[43:16.52]What happens when the explosion goes off and it goes over the ground and it seeps down into the soil and drips down into the basement?
[43:23.69]Get in a tree.
[43:24.95]Build a treehouse.
[43:26.21]You know, specifically talking about zombie apocalypse, alien apocalypse.
[43:30.13]Just get in a tree.
[43:32.28]They're not going to cut the trees down.
[43:33.56]Just don't make any noise.
[43:34.52]Hang out there.
[43:35.50]Take a backpack with like 75 Campbell's tomato soups.
[43:40.23]You can live on those for like six months, right?
[43:42.77]Get like a couple of your friends, bring some wood and a hammer and nails, make a tree house, cover it with a bunch of leaves and shit.
[43:50.80]And just stay up there for like a year.
[43:52.62]Don't ever come down.
[43:53.52]Guess what?
[43:53.90]Oh, what am I going to do?
[43:55.92]Just piss off the side of the tree.
[43:58.16]Shit off the side of the tree.
[43:59.06]You're going to squat down.
[43:59.80]You're going to shit off the tree into the ground.
[44:03.18]Piss off the tree.
[44:03.88]Shit off the tree.
[44:04.40]You don't even need to worry about it.
[44:05.58]And guess what?
[44:06.14]If you need to wipe your ass, there's leaves everywhere.
[44:10.98]100 Campbell's tomato soups and a treehouse.
[44:14.54]Zombies going to climb that tree?
[44:16.77]No.
[44:17.21]Don't go to the mall.
[44:20.03]Go into the fucking woods, deep into the woods, and climb a goddamn tree.
[44:25.93]Then you'll be able to procreate.
[44:28.31]Not up in the tree.
[44:29.45]I'm not talking about, like, don't do that in the tree because you might fall down.
[44:31.89]And, well, what if I'm going to fall down?
[44:33.76]Oh, don't worry.
[44:34.58]You go up there with at least two people.
[44:35.86]One person gets to hold everybody while the other people sleep.
[44:40.40]You know what I'm saying?
[44:41.28]So, like, what?
[44:42.02]That was weird.
[44:43.72]So one person is up in the tree.
[44:45.02]Let's say there's three of us.
[44:46.10]One, two, three.
[44:48.00]And there's enough room for three of us to sit on one of the big branches, right?
[44:51.16]So I'm in the middle.
[44:52.96]Two people here.
[44:54.05]That's as much room as we got.
[44:56.11]These two people are asleep.
[44:59.51]And I have to like, I'm holding them so they can sleep for like four or five hours, right?
[45:06.35]Then we switch places.
[45:09.10]If they need to piss or shit, they just do it.
[45:11.18]Just have no pants on, pee and shit, and just sleep.
[45:13.82]And then we switch places and the person in the middle holds everybody else.
[45:18.70]Ah, upgrading the saucer.
[45:19.38]I hope you have plenty of DNA to trade.
[45:27.22]I expected more, but I suppose that will have to suffice.
[45:51.06]What a waste of internet time.
[45:53.02]What?
[45:53.40]What I just said?
[45:54.14]Yeah, go down in your bunker.
[45:57.70]For somebody to break open the fucking hatch and come and kill everybody and take all the supplies.
[46:02.89]They're not going up a tree.
[46:07.37]Don't.
[46:07.93]I'll be the one to survive.
[46:20.94]Am I gonna stream the Bethesda conference?
[46:22.20]Uh, no.
[46:23.06]It's gonna be a little too late for me.
[46:34.41]Humans can't climb trees.
[46:35.75]No, they would just... They wouldn't want to.
[46:37.53]How tall is the tree?
[46:38.47]It could be, I don't know, like 300 or 400 feet tall?
[46:40.29]Let's get an ice pick and you can get up there.
[46:59.64]These mines fire an electromagnetic pulse that disables your weapons and jetpack.
[47:04.75]Avoid the EMP mines if you can.
[47:06.59]So I can't go near the EMP.
[47:09.93]But I need to extract brains.
[47:12.09]I don't have a time limit, so that's good.
[47:18.23]I can't drain the car.
[47:21.94]I need to... There are specific people that are...
[47:28.13]Why are there specific people that I need to get?
[47:29.95]Oh, what?
[47:34.23]Okay.
[47:41.17]I'm losing focus.
[47:44.21]I love a man in uniform.
[47:46.37]Oh, wait.
[47:46.99]What would Elliot Ness do?
[47:48.99]Never carry... I want to ride a motorcycle.
[47:51.19]How come I never get to ride a motorcycle?
[47:53.59]Motorcycle cops have all the fun.
[47:59.43]I'm curious here.
[48:03.53]Good work, Crypto.
[48:05.21]You just collected an overloaded brain stem.
[48:08.36]Only 11 more to go.
[48:10.72]Well, I know it sounds like a lot, but I think it's quite an achievable goal.
[48:16.88]Let's go.
[48:17.38]I guess I can just pull anybody's brain.
[48:19.52]So this is what Elliot meant by a life of quiet desperation.
[48:23.48]Thanks a lot, you limey bastard.
[48:26.93]That's the location of all the overloaded brain.
[48:29.03]No, that's not.
[48:29.87]There it is.
[48:30.23]Okay.
[48:38.00]You were mistaken.
[48:38.98]You didn't see anything.
[48:44.86]Hollow job jamming.
[48:45.58]The hollow Bob.
[48:46.08]Hollow job.
[48:46.36]What the fuck does that mean?
[48:55.89]It will not fool the majestic agents for long.
[48:57.79]They have the ability to jam the disguise and bring it down.
[49:00.95]Your disguise will pulse red when a majestic agent is too close.
[49:04.19]Take out or avoid them while in disguise.
[49:10.12]Interesting, okay.
[49:13.14]Scan, scan, scan, scan!
[49:25.06]Which one of these guys is the agent?
[49:30.18]He's right there.
[49:31.46]He's the dude on the right.
[49:32.84]I'm going to sneak around here.
[49:34.62]Whoa.
[49:35.18]Don't be seen by that guy.
[49:56.43]I still need to get that brain.
[50:01.37]Fuck, there's so many people here.
[50:02.51]Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[50:05.96]Oh, boy.
[50:06.12]Okay.
[50:25.73]Is there a reason why I can't shoot?
[50:27.85]There we go.
[50:31.49]Can I destroy those with my gun?
[50:38.33]I can, I can.
[50:39.01]Let's get rid of them.
[50:54.15]If they cause that much of a problem, just delete them.
[50:57.79]Where's this?
[50:58.37]What does it want me to do with this?
[51:01.51]Just throw it at somebody?
[51:06.11]Oh, it's in there.
[51:16.11]Disguise and then skate away.
[51:25.72]Rex from Toy Story.
[51:27.92]Wait, what?
[51:28.42]What are you talking about?
[51:31.72]I guess I could just fucking, who cares, just skate around.
[51:34.38]I'm gonna extract everybody here's brain and then run away.
[51:38.20]Nice.
[51:42.71]Just fly around and pick up the other ship.
[51:45.31]To serve and protect.
[51:46.15]To serve and protect.
[51:47.11]To swerve and defect.
[51:49.03]To curve and perfect.
[51:50.79]Dammit, I lost it.
[51:53.44]That makes the most sense, I think.
[51:55.16]Just collectively pull everybody's brain.
[51:56.70]And then... Kill him!
[51:57.44]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[52:00.46]Let's blow it up.
[52:24.86]Now let's go on brain collection duty.
[52:26.85]Here we go.
[52:27.33]One, two, three, four.
[52:28.31]What's going on there?
[52:30.15]Can I get all of them?
[52:34.11]Yeah.
[52:34.23]Alright.
[52:37.47]Keep going.
[52:38.77]High-level threat!
[52:39.49]Take down with deadly force!
[52:40.95]Enemy is small, great, and temperamental!
[52:45.09]Smart coffee.
[52:50.05]Whoo-hoo!
[52:51.49]Goodbye.
[52:55.21]Something is just fun about doing bad though.
[52:57.46]That's like the scary of the bad guys, right?
[52:59.38]No, that guy's still alive!
[53:06.58]Go!
[53:24.43]Gonna throw him very far away.
[53:31.25]Then you can just do whatever you want.
[53:32.99]You can clear everything.
[53:35.02]This mission's actually... This mission's actually kind of hot.
[53:50.25]How did it not break?
[53:53.65]Seven out of twelve.
[53:56.53]Fuck, he just disintegrated me.
[53:57.89]God damn it.
[53:59.33]I'm gonna run.
[54:03.77]Two had a great story.
[54:06.39]Two is an actual open world, isn't it?
[54:11.28]God, fuck.
[54:14.56]So what was wrong with three?
[54:15.76]Why was three considered so bad?
[54:19.09]That was the latest generation one, right?
[54:23.57]Dickhead.
[54:24.68]It was Wii only.
[54:38.96]Was it actually only for Wii?
[54:42.46]That seems terrible.
[54:43.28]I could take that guy and that guy and her.
[54:48.53]Can I not extract this guy's brain?
[54:52.53]I almost used a full bar on that guy.
[54:54.25]Okay, whatever.
[54:54.79]Alright, into the pool.
[55:01.05]Oh, shit.
[55:02.35]Almost got it.
[55:03.23]Come here, lady.
[55:18.27]Come here.
[55:27.98]Oh, pick up the car.
[55:28.84]Whoa.
[55:29.66]Whoa, boy.
[55:30.52]Time to run.
[55:40.81]Give me the brains!
[55:44.35]I'm out of ammo for the... the good weapon.
[55:52.19]Wait.
[55:54.34]Okay, that was cool.
[55:57.40]I need to anal probe somebody.
[56:00.44]Anal probing somebody will give me a good amount of brain XP.
[56:10.46]Right here Won't be long Two more?
[56:20.01]Whoops Oh, you've ran at the exact time?
[56:22.35]How could you do something like that to me?
[56:25.03]Damn
[56:39.35]God damn.
[56:40.35]Oh man, okay.
[56:42.79]Time to run.
[56:43.81]Those guys require a lot more than that.
[56:50.51]Doesn't hurt it.
[56:53.32]Alright, I need ammo.
[56:57.60]I can't destroy that.
[57:04.30]Break it!
[57:05.32]Argh!
[57:07.95]Ooh, not good.
[57:17.18]Break it!
[57:23.26]Oh, you dickhead.
[57:25.88]Alright.
[57:27.55]Last two of these big brains and then I just need to extract.
[57:35.35]Now, anal probe and be done.
[57:38.67]Two more people.
[57:41.17]This game's actually pretty addicting.
[57:42.97]I'm having a lot of fun just running around doing this.
[57:51.52]Yes, it is an anal probe.
[58:06.58]When are we going to play Minecraft?
[58:08.86]Um, when Minecraft 2 comes out.
[58:10.46]How does that sound?
[58:13.60]16 dies, deformed lurkers stalks Clancy Street Estate.
[58:22.01]Yeah, when Minecraft 2 comes out, I'll play it.
[58:23.47]Head back to the ship.
[58:36.19]Here we go.
[58:38.91]They just announced it?
[58:39.95]No, they didn't.
[58:45.02]They're not making a Minecraft 2.
[58:46.54]What are you gonna code it in?
[58:50.56]Unity?
[58:54.58]Have you seen that game's code?
[58:55.84]Newsflash.
[58:57.64]It's a mess.
[59:04.50]You know they have to make that game like 12 times after they make a patch?
[59:07.80]They have to compile that game 12 times.
[59:10.80]In Java.
[59:12.76]Every single patch, everything they do needs to be made over 12 different variations.
[59:19.25]That's what my friend who went to two college classes of Java told me.
[59:26.37]I can't do anything.
[59:28.44]Got it all already.
[59:29.20]Let's go.
[59:35.47]Back in California.
[59:36.15]Nothing about Minecraft in E3 so far.
[59:43.28]What was the EA conference?
[59:44.08]I don't even see it.
[59:45.80]Did they have anything there?
[59:51.80]Crypto?
[59:52.88]You're going to investigate the activities of the human scientists.
[59:57.51]I want to establish the connection with the majestic... E3 stream is playing dubstep right now.
[60:03.47]Why am I not surprised?
[60:08.26]I heard the ea conference they played a phone game for like 15 minutes all American fast food sensation government scientists helping to defend against communism through better cuisine retrieve information from the scientists where the hell would they be there
[60:34.94]Let's scoot over this way.
[60:36.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:37.91]Oh, it's an ice cream truck scientist.
[60:39.73]Okay.
[60:42.85]Slow children.
[60:43.79]Okay, does he get out of the car?
[60:50.89]that special seasoning has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.
[60:54.99]These people are now rabid paranoiacs and incredibly hostile to anyone who's different.
[61:01.45]And as an unexpected side benefit, 78% of them are now registering Republican.
[61:08.34]Now we're getting rip political.
[61:09.30]Alright, now you're going to park and we're going to get the same thing out of you, right?
[61:14.34]Yeah.
[61:15.56]No, you're smart.
[61:17.20]You're not a stupid AI.
[61:18.56]You're a smart AI.
[61:20.04]Good to know.
[61:24.10]I'm just gonna wait till they all come to the parking lot.
[61:36.99]Come to me.
[61:37.47]Oh my god, I'm just walking around as an alien.
[61:40.81]That was not good.
[61:45.90]Come on, you're all gonna come to the ice cream store anyways, aren't you?
[61:49.96]Apparently not yet.
[61:51.52]Will you get a load of this new brassiere?
[61:53.66]I could torpedo a U-boat with these things.
[61:58.08]God.
[61:58.42]Keep it together, man.
[61:59.46]Keep it together.
[62:00.90]Evil doers are everywhere.
[62:02.18]Where is he?
[62:03.10]Oh, he's right here.
[62:03.48]It's a secret flavor.
[62:05.78]I know I'm not supposed to eat from the diner, or I'll turn into a mindless, paranoid drone, but that rhubarb pie is calling my name.
[62:12.79]Heinrich!
[62:13.89]Liebschen!
[62:14.77]Heinrich!
[62:15.63]You have to move, guys.
[62:19.28]Move.
[62:20.15]He actually beeps.
[62:21.01]This game was way before its time.
[62:23.43]AI beeps at people on PlayStation 2?
[62:27.37]Grand Theft Auto 3 was the first game to ever do that.
[62:29.37]When did that come out?
[62:32.30]Alright.
[62:32.50]Seem to have gotten all the information.
[62:45.67]Let's string this one up.
[62:47.11]Mob violence really gets my motor running.
[62:49.91]Clearly the scientists are responsible for carrying out Majestic's population control schemes.
[62:56.56]Normally I'd ask you to destroy the scientists, but we have a bigger problem Majestic are using the food outlets to distribute their population control drugs And it seems to be working.
[63:10.72]If every human in this country turns paranoid and hostile it will make life for us very difficult You may want to use the salsa for this.
[63:20.74]Alright, let's do it Destroy all the diners
[63:26.54]Way before it's time.
[63:28.00]Or exactly where it belongs in it's time.
[63:37.32]I would love to see an actual open world remade Destroy All Humans.
[63:43.30]Be great.
[63:51.13]Do I need to kill them?
[63:55.71]I think I've been able to destroy.
[64:00.97]I don't know if aliens are communists.
[64:09.86]No, we're just- we're actually just aliens, man.
[64:14.30]Sorry to burst your bubble.
[64:15.52]Let's see if I can get them all in one sweep.
[64:26.56]No, not quite.
[64:30.73]Still one more guy.
[64:31.75]I got him.
[64:41.09]They just took the diner, too.
[64:42.93]We gotta set up a line and hold them here.
[64:45.75]Well, I don't know about you, but I'm not sitting around here waiting to get abducted.
[64:49.69]Keep your panties on, Mary.
[64:51.90]I just got a word over the radio.
[64:53.62]There's an army convoy right outside this town.
[64:56.58]I'm happy about that.
[64:59.58]Thank majestic.
[65:01.12]Silhouette got the army to do something right for once.
[65:04.09]Take some cars and go get them.
[65:05.79]Try and stop me.
[65:07.13]Alright, gotta take down the...
[65:11.47]Military.
[65:14.73]Destroy the Majestic Convoy and the Army Patrol.
[65:17.20]Okay.
[65:18.38]I gotta concentrate here.
[65:19.16]These are actually kind of difficult.
[65:25.00]Left to right.
[65:33.23]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[65:34.45]Get him.
[65:35.89]Oooh.
[65:42.62]Ooh, tank.
[65:44.06]Shit, that hurts.
[65:49.52]Dead?
[65:57.27]Yep.
[65:57.91]No!
[66:01.45]That was close.
[66:04.88]Oh, damn.
[66:06.24]Oh, damn.
[66:07.18]Don't hurt me, man.
[66:19.46]Move away.
[66:19.98]Do I have like a warp speed?
[66:21.48]Wow!
[66:22.10]Fuck!
[66:25.04]Get this thing away from me, man!
[66:33.77]That's intense.
[66:39.09]I'm dead.
[66:41.02]One hit and I'm done.
[66:41.96]Give me that.
[66:43.94]That was lucky.
[66:47.19]Don't bump it into fucking trees.
[66:48.47]Don't bump into the damn trees.
[66:50.98]Stupid missile sights.
[67:02.62]Ugh!
[67:10.53]What's this last thing here that I'm not seeing?
[67:17.25]I just think there's something still on the map.
[67:21.23]I mean, I see this, but I don't see anything else.
[67:26.03]What's this final thing here?
[67:28.57]You guys see what I'm talking about?
[67:34.16]I don't see anything.
[67:35.54]Is that the building?
[67:51.64]Guy in the road?
[67:52.44]Apparently they were... Get rid of the army and the convoy!
[68:01.33]I might be bugged.
[68:01.87]Well, that's not good.
[68:03.61]Apparently it's right below me.
[68:07.01]Whatever that is.
[68:07.57]Maybe I should have land.
[68:18.28]There it is.
[68:18.86]Okay, that was weird.
[68:23.34]That was a close call.
[68:24.92]That's a G-man.
[68:25.78]One thing's for certain.
[68:27.69]Majestic are far more dangerous to our mission than I had heretofore suspected.
[68:32.85]I say it's high time we abducted one of these men in really, really dark brown and gave him a foot probing.
[68:41.73]What do you say?
[68:43.17]Men in really, really dark brown.
[68:45.36]Alright, where is he?
[68:50.00]I think you're going to have to land your saucer and capture the agent.
[68:53.15]I'm not landing yet.
[68:54.17]How does he hook like that in those shoes?
[68:58.05]Get rid of the tanks first.
[69:04.82]Whoa.
[69:05.54]Holy shit.
[69:08.76]Alright.
[69:09.24]Easy here, man.
[69:19.01]I can land.
[69:19.49]Where can I land?
[69:21.45]Is it across the way here?
[69:27.70]Too many fucking people.
[69:28.52]Too many people.
[69:29.04]Go land.
[69:33.22]Holy God!
[69:37.87]I need a place to land!
[69:56.37]Let's get out.
[69:58.15]Now I need to abduct him, so make him run back to the ship, right?
[70:06.37]Someone over this way.
[70:10.33]Am I gonna be able to abduct this guy?
[70:12.89]Disguise.
[70:21.98]Should have got that first, but I didn't.
[70:32.69]Oh well.
[70:36.33]I could wait for the cops to leave.
[70:39.61]Is that going to be an issue?
[70:41.23]I could probably do that far enough away.
[70:49.54]I'm sure that meter in the top left doesn't go down.
[70:51.92]I'd be very sad about that.
[70:53.00]That sounded like Robin Akin Downs.
[71:01.77]I wouldn't be surprised.
[71:02.55]He would be fairly... 2006?
[71:03.07]2007?
[71:03.11]That makes sense.
[71:10.95]It's a good day to use excessive farce.
[71:13.89]Heck, every day is a good day for excessive farce.
[71:40.63]Who's crashing right now?
[71:42.77]This is taking a lot.
[71:44.27]Oh.
[71:44.73]My.
[71:45.37]God.
[71:45.73]That's the human from World of Warcraft.
[71:48.43]Get ready for probing.
[71:49.19]What are you doing?
[72:11.11]look at me again punk I dare you I double dare you I double dog dare you I have to move these oh god damn it don't kill him oh alright go ahead you can go make my day I only want to talk don't shoot that's you idiot
[72:38.52]Is he dead?
[72:38.98]Oh, thank... No, don't do it again!
[72:42.46]If he did it again, I'd be so angry.
[73:00.52]There's a lot of dangers on the way back.
[73:01.98]Don't run over things that could explode.
[73:03.58]I just seriously shit my pants.
[73:04.58]I may have.
[73:04.80]I may have.
[73:06.14]Keep going.
[73:06.47]You're good.
[73:29.18]It's like we traveled to a future where TV was in color and they made a program about our happy days Thank God these guys have a lot of health otherwise we would be scraping them off the road by now There we go
[73:59.20]Should I show my pants on facecam to make sure?
[74:05.98]You know, I can't do it.
[74:07.48]What if I had a little tub of water over here and I dumped my butt part of my pants in the water and held it up in front of the camera?
[74:14.01]That would be fucking gross.
[74:27.67]Prove you pissed your pants.
[74:29.33]Alright, fine!
[74:29.97]I like lift him up.
[74:31.03]Am I gonna watch the Bethesda press conference on stream in like two and a half hours?
[74:38.07]Probably not.
[74:38.53]I'll probably be streaming by then.
[74:39.91]But I will... I will...
[74:49.52]I'll probably stream the Sony conference tomorrow.
[74:51.84]And if not, then I'm gonna be working on something to do the Nintendo conference, so... Don't expect the Sony conference, but expect the Nintendo one.
[75:00.98]Maybe.
[75:04.02]But I do not know if I'll be doing the Bethesda one.
[75:05.81]Please stream the Bethesda one.
[75:18.62]I mean, maybe.
[75:19.18]Who knows?
[75:19.56]Maybe I'm, like, still into it.
[75:20.76]How long is it going to be?
[75:21.58]Like, an hour and a half?
[75:22.30]Hour?
[75:22.92]I can't assume it'll be longer than Microsoft's.
[75:35.46]Hurts, don't it, monkey boy?
[75:38.42]You want it to stop, don't you?
[75:41.36]Then give daddy what he needs.
[75:49.67]We'll see where we're at.
[75:51.61]I mean, that's assuming that I'm still going to be playing or sitting here for the next two and a half hours, so I'm not sure.
[75:57.90]I don't really have a plan right now.
[76:03.18]Prepare to return to the mothership, Crypto.
[76:05.69]We're going back to Rockwell for the last time.
[76:09.45]In a second.
[76:11.19]I definitely won't be watching the Devolver one on stream.
[76:14.21]Because that's like 11 o'clock.
[76:19.29]Or like 12 o'clock Eastern here.
[76:23.62]But I'll do the major ones.
[76:25.12]I'll definitely do at least this one and Nintendo.
[76:28.68]Sony is... Depending on how deeply I want to attempt to do this thing on Tuesday, I probably can't stream anything tomorrow.
[76:37.87]Or really today for that matter.
[76:39.71]Okay, for those of you that... Let's go over this.
[76:44.25]I just got the green light to do something really fucking stupid.
[76:48.89]And it's going to take every ounce of my effort over the next two days to make it a reality.
[76:54.17]Which includes today.
[76:56.25]So I have to kind of forego streaming the conferences later because I need to make a bunch of phone calls once this stream is over.
[77:09.40]So I'm kind of playing with would I rather and I would rather try to do the thing on Tuesday.
[77:18.85]If I can't get it to work, then I can't get it to work.
[77:20.89]But at least I'll try, right?
[77:29.57]I will give you a confirmation if it's happening or not.
[77:32.53]Probably tomorrow.
[77:35.73]No, not a polygraph test.
[77:37.81]You'll see.
[77:38.33]You'll just, you'll see if it ends up happening.
[77:41.21]Hope so.
[77:42.61]But that's why I can't really stick around for like six, seven, eight hours today.
[77:46.35]I just, I need to kind of really get to work on this.
[77:54.59]What's he going to do?
[77:55.05]Oh my god, he's going to pick this up and explode it?
[77:56.59]Oh, never mind.
[78:01.05]Alright, let's, uh, back to military.
[78:12.42]six seven six hundred and seventy eight hours is a long time yeah alright any more upgrades it will tell me if there are upgrades right so I don't have to keep checking this apparently not step inside my shop I got this one I got this one
[78:32.13]750.
[78:32.19]Chain lightning to two additional targets.
[78:34.26]So it goes to four.
[78:36.06]Okay, what about shipping?
[78:41.12]I got this one.
[78:41.64]That's the only one I can do.
[78:44.70]Super chain lightning.
[78:45.54]I like it.
[78:50.51]Just a friendly reminder that the actual plague, the real plague, is in Nevada.
[78:56.13]Be careful when you move there.
[78:57.67]The plague is in...
[79:00.05]The plague is in Las Vegas.
[79:05.73]What?
[79:06.77]Are you... I don't believe that for a second.
[79:13.81]Well, see you later, guys.
[79:18.58]It's been fun.
[79:29.90]the bubonic plague is curable now.
[79:35.48]Now the bubonic plague was essentially the flu.
[79:39.46]But back then they didn't know what to do with it.
[79:40.98]They thought you were possessed by demons back then.
[79:44.54]They like hung you upside down and carved your eyes out to get the demons to come out of you when you had the cold like 600 years ago.
[79:54.17]There's a whole wide world out there and we're missing it.
[80:00.17]But where can we go, Billy?
[80:01.73]This town's a one-way ticket for wild hearts like you and me.
[80:06.71]It's tearing me apart!
[80:09.75]Did they actually do... What you need is a new direction.
[80:12.27]Hey, the room reference here?
[80:14.07]Are you kidding me?
[80:15.51]Wow, that's actually... I'm surprised to see that.
[80:17.19]Ever thought about homeland protection?
[80:19.66]Home what?
[80:20.70]Wise up, Romeo.
[80:21.90]There's a half a billion Reds who'd love nothing better than to rip that varsity sweater right off your back.
[80:27.76]No kidding.
[80:28.70]Take this little pamphlet.
[80:30.06]It'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting your little corner of the country from communist invasion.
[80:35.95]Thanks a million, Daddy-O.
[80:38.59]Freakin' A. Wow.
[80:41.33]There goes a real American.
[80:43.49]A real American dreamboat.
[80:46.23]Meow.
[80:47.35]God.
[80:52.89]Anyways, how's your sex life?
[80:53.71]It's in a BB-8 unit.
[81:20.75]You feel it.
[81:21.63]I feel it too.
[81:24.31]Let it go, Ray.
[81:26.63]Sounded like secret agent man was taking orders from the one in goggles.
[81:32.41]Want me to blow him up?
[81:36.60]Go to the drive-in theater.
[81:38.99]See the plaza over there by the big screen?
[81:41.91]The humans drive their carbon combustion transports in, and thence view projected images for the purpose of ENTERTAINMENT!
[81:50.37]I really wish they would make a description.
[81:52.11]Imagine a hundred aliens, like, parachuting down.
[81:55.79]Sorry.
[81:56.17]I can't even keep that one going.
[82:03.60]I can't even finish that sentence.
[82:10.82]Entertainment!
[82:20.90]Blue Moon Drive-In Cinema.
[82:22.18]Kill any enemies at the drive-in.
[82:23.68]Okay.
[82:28.09]I think that's an enemy.
[82:31.65]You people make me sick, pathetic humans.
[82:34.99]There'll be a weirdo somewhere.
[82:41.54]Can I put this guy through the screen?
[82:44.38]There's nothing you can do to me that the Chinese haven't already... I'm pretty sure the Chinese didn't do that to you.
[82:54.64]Are they actually playing a movie?
[82:57.64]My biological clock is ticking like a time bomb.
[83:00.40]Work with me here, people.
[83:03.25]Beat your heart out, Lana Turner.
[83:05.43]You've got nothing on me.
[83:11.70]Go to bed.
[83:12.53]I want to watch the movie.
[83:15.71]Let's see.
[83:16.19]What is it?
[83:16.85]It's a real movie.
[83:17.53]It's like 180p.
[83:18.25]Let's put this guy through the screen.
[83:20.41]I hate this movie.
[83:47.68]These people are having sex in here.
[83:51.16]Disgusting!
[83:53.74]Let's put him through the screen.
[84:03.21]Oh!
[84:08.19]I broke the screen.
[84:08.83]I didn't know you could do that.
[84:09.65]I really didn't know I could do that.
[84:14.73]Apparently people are still watching the movie.
[84:20.23]Honestly, I just Wile E. Coyote'd through that movie screen.
[84:24.97]Let's kill these guys.
[84:27.89]I was watching that.
[84:29.49]Well, not anymore.
[84:35.55]I didn't hit him with the bike.
[84:36.26]Are you kidding me?
[84:37.60]What if the other guys notice?
[84:39.42]Oh, who cares?
[84:40.46]Lace feels so comfortable under this suit.
[84:44.90]I'm a teepee.
[84:45.38]I'm a wigwam.
[84:46.04]I'm a teepee.
[84:46.70]I'm a wigwam.
[84:47.32]Relax, pal.
[84:48.48]You're too tense.
[85:02.03]Excellent!
[85:03.37]I've prepared a special film that I'm sure the audience will love.
[85:08.24]Be a good boy and pick it up.
[85:10.90]I'm on it.
[85:14.42]How about just one of these ones?
[85:15.34]Get those brains.
[85:16.70]Get the movie.
[85:18.78]You're in the way.
[85:30.45]Suck out his brain.
[85:31.37]How are they going to watch this when he's broken?
[85:33.19]Where is this?
[85:33.69]Where's the movie?
[85:34.39]Can I put this back?
[85:35.35]I'm going to try to put this back on.
[85:36.99]All I have to do is hold it.
[85:37.76]Is it still playing?
[85:57.01]I wish it was still playing.
[85:57.96]We could actually go take this into a private place and watch the movie.
[86:00.68]Okay, let's put it back.
[86:03.16]Don't worry, I'm just putting the movie back together.
[86:16.18]Whoops.
[86:23.89]Do you know how a projector works?
[86:27.05]We'll take that too.
[86:28.79]We'll take that too.
[86:31.09]Oh fuck Goofy I have a rifle.
[86:46.54]Her name is Sue.
[86:55.11]Disguise as this cowboy dude.
[86:59.33]Think fire!
[87:05.99]Is anybody going to be angry with me?
[87:09.18]We didn't talk about it.
[87:09.96]Are people going to be mad at me if I say that Kingdom Hearts 3 looked awful?
[87:15.58]Can I say that?
[87:16.68]Am I allowed to say that?
[87:17.98]Or are people going to hate me?
[87:31.89]Can I?
[87:33.20]I love the first two.
[87:34.44]I'm a huge fan.
[87:37.10]I was a big fan of at least the first one.
[87:41.76]Honestly, I think it had to do with the weird audio.
[87:44.90]Like, the, all you can hear is, I, we say our lines, and nothing else.
[87:50.18]I think that was what it was.
[87:54.44]If they actually didn't have, like, the weird fan-dub feel to it, I probably wouldn't be saying it.
[88:04.69]Just felt, that trailer really did feel like they had to throw that together really quickly.
[88:08.95]That seems very odd.
[88:18.12]When we're serious with such good music, the trailer literally had the music cut out.
[88:23.30]Now, sit back and enjoy the following educational presentation from the Furon Empire.
[88:29.15]Can I put this in front of the projector and watch it?
[88:32.53]Crypto, the humans are trying to stop the movie.
[88:36.17]Kill the bastards!
[88:37.99]Have they no respect for art?
[88:39.60]I'm going to kill him with the projector.
[88:43.46]Hold on to your hats, boys.
[88:45.40]I'm going
[88:47.38]Not the projector, the big screen thing.
[88:49.20]Where is he?
[88:51.10]Oh, he's looking at it.
[88:55.38]Somehow I only got those two.
[88:59.03]It's bouncing off his head.
[89:19.05]The humans are still trying to stop the movie.
[89:22.00]If you don't prevent them, our efforts will be for naught.
[89:25.42]Oh!
[89:25.74]I really hate naught.
[89:27.80]Brain, they've almost managed to stop the movie.
[89:31.96]Oh, they did.
[89:34.06]This is your last chance to stop them, Crypto.
[89:37.43]I did not know that's what was happening.
[89:41.19]Get away from that.
[89:42.39]Get away from that.
[89:43.85]You dick.
[89:55.39]Fuck!
[89:57.49]Oh, I was too busy making like the stupid... I was like, I didn't realize I fucked out.
[90:08.64]God damn it.
[90:09.58]Now I can do that stupid fucking whole thing again.
[90:16.45]I didn't realize they were, like, swarming the projector.
[90:18.67]I thought they were gonna, like, run in and start shooting me.
[90:21.82]I'm so mad at myself for this.
[90:23.36]I'm pancaking the same guy, like, laughing, and they're all swarming the projector, touching it.
[90:34.83]I was just goofing around.
[90:39.77]God damn it.
[90:41.19]Get a grip.
[90:44.00]Sounded like secret agent man was taking orders from the one in goggles.
[90:49.76]Want me to blow him up?
[90:53.34]Thank you, Crypto, but I have a better idea.
[90:56.24]See the plaza over there by the big screen?
[90:59.26]The humans drive their carbon combustion transporters in and then... I think it is moon gombad.
[91:05.76]Moon gombad?
[91:08.83]Makes perfect sense.
[91:11.03]Moon gombad.
[91:11.95]I think I goombastomped that person.
[91:13.09]What the fuck am I talking about?
[91:28.75]You're dead.
[91:31.98]Just kill him.
[91:34.96]Right against the wall.
[91:35.80]Smash against the wall.
[91:36.56]I'm not screwing around.
[91:54.82]Last guy's coming around the corner.
[91:55.78]Go get the tape.
[91:56.82]I just fucking mooned that guy.
[91:58.46]Yeah, serious gaming time.
[92:00.70]No, I'm not fucking around.
[92:06.51]And I gotta stand near the projector and I gotta babysit it.
[92:27.29]Got him.
[92:27.87]Did he just dive out of the way?
[92:31.61]No.
[92:31.89]Yes he did.
[92:32.67]And up in the air.
[92:35.19]See you later.
[92:35.55]Give me the fucking real.
[92:36.27]That guy ain't coming back.
[92:57.90]Go play the film.
[92:59.00]No more like, oh look at you, you're gonna pull it out of the projector.
[93:01.96]Yeah, I have to do Goofy.
[93:28.92]Goofy's in the chat.
[93:33.26]I'm ready.
[93:34.44]We've got to make a little bit of a good scenario here where I can get some coverage.
[93:39.73]I've hit triangle.
[93:41.25]Not going to happen.
[93:42.31]This is my favorite weapon.
[93:43.39]I'm going to use this.
[93:58.66]I can't believe it took this much of the time out of this.
[94:02.22]I don't want to kill anybody accidentally.
[94:06.46]Oh my god.
[94:11.55]I just killed all those people.
[94:19.75]Strike.
[94:25.46]Get away from that.
[94:26.04]There's nothing.
[94:37.87]I'm like trying so hard.
[94:49.04]I'm just, I'm Fortnite-ing these guys so bad.
[94:51.87]What's the thing called?
[94:53.09]Chicken dinner?
[94:53.55]What do they call it in Fortnite?
[94:56.53]Steak tartare?
[94:57.31]What do they call it?
[95:12.16]Come on.
[95:12.62]That was a comedian joke.
[95:14.94]A comedian would have said that.
[95:16.36]I'm just pretending to be one.
[95:19.12]I'm not a doctor.
[95:19.84]I just play one on TV.
[95:21.90]He still hasn't landed.
[95:34.87]Still hasn't landed.
[95:40.19]Alright, we're good.
[95:49.40]Furon flicks hit sticks.
[95:50.76]Meet the Furon.
[95:51.56]That's something for everyone.
[95:59.50]What can I say?
[96:04.51]Alright, now I can do whatever I want.
[96:16.62]We're gonna extract our bunch of brains here, it's gonna be great.
[96:19.12]Alright, brain extraction, here we go.
[96:26.28]Let's get some DNA out of this.
[96:28.82]Is that it?
[96:33.70]Was I the only guy that was dead on the ground?
[96:37.62]Oh, I vaporized everybody.
[96:39.69]Oops!
[96:44.76]The hollow clanging sounds of the cars are beautiful.
[96:49.71]This game's cool.
[96:51.59]I like it.
[96:52.17]New mission available, new B-movie now showing.
[96:55.61]New research, okay.
[96:56.67]Cool.
[96:57.23]Let's go see what it is.
[97:01.39]I already got these two.
[97:02.55]I already got this one.
[97:08.19]Already got this one, okay.
[97:13.64]So a thousand DNA is more damage for the saucer.
[97:16.06]That's all I can do.
[97:19.20]So I need a thousand DNA.
[97:20.70]You thought Microsoft was going to announce the Minecraft with Steve Carell as Steve from Minecraft?
[97:37.71]Why would they ever do that?
[97:43.18]Can I make a saucer joke?
[97:44.56]No, probably not.
[97:46.76]I have to pee again though.
[97:48.28]God damn this old man body.
[97:49.70]Press the R2 button to cycle to the ion detonator.
[98:08.04]Lob a detonator.
[98:08.79]Press and hold the R1 button to lob it further.
[98:11.13]Okay.
[98:13.71]Once a detonator is active, it can be triggered by pressing the R1 button again.
[98:17.55]That'll also explode on a timer.
[98:18.65]Be very careful with this weapon, Crypto.
[98:20.83]It can hurt you as well if you get too close.
[98:26.26]Alright.
[98:30.16]That was cool.
[98:33.52]Detonated in the air.
[98:34.41]This doesn't go very far.
[98:42.75]That's fun.
[98:44.03]More cars.
[98:46.23]I need more ammo.
[98:46.77]It's just the red stuff littered around.
[98:48.04]Okay.
[98:48.30]Well, that didn't go very far.
[98:50.04]Oh boy.
[99:03.78]I need more ammo.
[99:04.92]Where's the ammo?
[99:06.84]Well that was... I was gonna say almost instant death, but it still kind of was.
[99:37.09]One more.
[99:39.31]One more little batch.
[99:42.06]Come on, wait to the... Come on, keep going.
[99:43.70]No, no, no, no.
[99:44.42]Go, go, go.
[99:46.24]Come on.
[99:47.46]Keep going.
[99:47.82]I don't want us to detonate.
[99:50.69]You've got their attention Now it's time to cause this nasty organization some real damage if it looks majestic Teach them the meaning of skill.
[100:06.55]Oh, okay.
[100:07.15]Well cause $200,000 worth of damage the majestic organization.
[100:15.89]Oh Boy
[100:23.51]That was close.
[100:26.25]How much is one car?
[100:26.83]$450 for a car?
[100:27.35]Doesn't seem right.
[100:27.97]Attica.
[100:28.27]Am I gonna blow my own ship up?
[100:56.23]39, 62.
[100:56.97]Ah, did I not blow it up?
[101:05.17]Dude!
[101:06.55]Come on, go further than that, thank god.
[101:11.42]I need to run away here.
[101:15.46]That car cost as much as my internet.
[101:18.57]That's pretty damn sad.
[101:20.15]Alright.
[101:25.25]The thing is, does it have to be?
[101:26.43]I don't think I have to use that thing.
[101:39.03]Why is that guy proning?
[101:40.89]Why would you prone?
[101:42.35]What are you doing?
[101:43.15]There's no reason to be prone.
[101:50.70]It's time to exterminate the majestic infestation in this town.
[101:57.36]Find the majestic beast in this town and destroy it.
[102:01.10]Turn.
[102:02.78]Turn.
[102:07.45]We go restock You can destroy the buildings using your saucer I
[102:34.40]Oh.
[102:36.66]Well, we're gonna do that.
[102:37.78]We're gonna do that.
[102:40.02]Get out of the way.
[102:41.22]Just get in the boat.
[103:02.36]Oh, shit.
[103:03.46]I can't get in.
[103:07.59]Get away.
[103:08.35]Clear the fucking zone, man.
[103:12.11]Get it.
[103:12.71]Get down.
[103:17.23]Clear enough for you?
[103:20.08]Clear enough for you?
[103:20.74]Oh!
[103:21.14]Alright, I got them.
[103:23.92]Explode.
[103:28.20]They didn't explode.
[103:29.00]Come on, man.
[103:31.75]That guy killed himself.
[103:35.77]Alright, give me up.
[103:40.37]I love when they do the Garry's Mod.
[103:41.91]They fly away with their arms and legs straight out.
[103:50.12]What do you mean, am I talking to a dog?
[103:53.02]Got a new weapon.
[103:56.10]Sonic Boom.
[104:00.56]Knock down buildings with Sonic Boom.
[104:05.46]Okay.
[104:10.68]Alright.
[104:12.24]Oh, this thing is dangerous.
[104:16.46]This is way better than the other thing is.
[104:19.45]Holy God.
[104:24.23]What the fuck is that thing?
[104:25.35]I don't know.
[104:25.97]I feel like I can suck people up too.
[104:30.13]As far as certain buildings, you get it.
[104:36.43]You can actually pull the glove now.
[104:39.67]Any more Sonic Booms?
[104:41.98]Alright.
[104:42.30]I actually have the... Tractor Beam now.
[104:48.12]Abduction Beam.
[104:51.76]I have to pee again.
[104:52.52]I'm sorry, I'm like 75 years old.
[104:54.62]I'll be right back.
[105:19.62]Wait, what?
[108:56.04]Wait, what?
[109:51.02]Wait, what?
[110:32.97]It's a random question for you guys.
[110:36.41]If the BRB screen just stayed there, and I never came back, how long would you guys sit here for, do you think?
[110:45.75]Do you think after like 10 minutes, somebody would be like, what's happening now?
[110:51.45]And after like 15 minutes, I'm tweeting that I'm out somewhere.
[110:58.25]You know, 15 minutes go by, I'm not back, and I'm tweeting about the restaurant that I'm currently in.
[111:10.63]People waited all night for a joke that didn't have- Oh yeah, wasn't there... I kinda caused a little mayhem with that, didn't I?
[111:21.96]Yeah, like, pictures show up, like, as I'm VRB, pictures show up in Disney World or something.
[111:28.08]Let's get back to it.
[111:30.82]Yeah, I made a, uh, I made a T. I needed to make a- Ooh.
[111:35.36]Oh, I'm done.
[111:36.41]Okay.
[111:49.97]Start streaming from another account.
[111:52.24]Just go on the Master of Comedy account or go on Binary Man, like 0110.
[111:56.36]And just start again.
[111:58.60]Just start streaming.
[111:59.86]And then go be right back and leave that one on too.
[112:03.04]Just do it across like five accounts.
[112:10.61]Let's see.
[112:14.35]And then come back on the third one.
[112:17.17]After you've done this like seven times with seven BRB screens.
[112:19.63]Come back on the third account.
[112:20.95]And keep playing the game you were playing on that third one.
[112:25.78]I do not have enough to get this.
[112:29.36]I need a thousand.
[112:34.60]Back to California.
[112:38.76]Do a stream where you pretend to be naked.
[112:40.60]I don't think you can pretend to be naked.
[112:44.67]There's no joke there.
[112:45.87]You're either naked or you're not naked.
[112:54.88]Yeah, guys, I'm going to get you.
[112:55.74]I'm going to pretend to be naked.
[113:02.66]We seem to have put a dent into Majestic's mind control efforts, but they won't stay down for long.
[113:08.43]However, if we can harness the massive power of television... You're fully clothed.
[113:14.03]You just pretend to be naked.
[113:16.77]We can easily transmit our signal on normal television frequencies.
[113:20.99]All we require is a... Green screen suit and projecting nudity on the green screen.
[113:27.40]That's actually a pretty funny idea, although you would get in trouble for it.
[113:35.23]It would be a Minecraft skin.
[113:37.32]You know how it's all weird and boxy and overlaps and...
[113:41.65]You know that talk about that Minecraft skin template?
[113:44.75]I knew it.
[113:45.51]I knew it.
[113:46.79]My prayers have been answered.
[113:48.81]On behalf of all the nations of the Earth, I welcome you to our planet, oh friend from another world.
[113:55.01]This is also Richard Horvath.
[113:56.69]Means a lot.
[113:58.61]Enough chitchat.
[114:00.08]We need to find Bert Wither.
[114:02.32]Where is he, pathetic crackpot human?
[114:05.60]You want Bert Wither?
[114:07.10]You got him.
[114:08.08]Follow me.
[114:11.41]Richard Horvitz has such an insanely distinct voice that they had to manipulate that so it didn't sound like him.
[114:21.68]Bertwether assassination scare.
[114:23.20]Safety fears cause American news icon to run to ground.
[114:27.68]Says the news cannot be silenced.
[114:31.44]Find Bertwether no majestic awareness.
[114:35.71]Why is that guy running away?
[114:37.29]Me and him friends?
[114:37.83]I thought me and him were friends.
[114:39.21]Who's talking right now?
[115:02.32]I like that Nixon.
[115:04.20]I got a feeling he's going to make us cops popular again.
[115:06.96]They're going to make us popular.
[115:12.87]Good old popular police.
[115:15.85]Bill of Rights.
[115:17.07]Who the hell needs a Bill of Rights?
[115:19.49]I'm Bill, and I'm right.
[115:22.47]This might break him out of his stupor here.
[115:25.88]We're good.
[115:27.94]Some people call me Joe Sixpack.
[115:30.34]I don't know why.
[115:31.18]I never work out.
[115:34.85]He's gonna get hit by a car.
[115:36.67]They always get hit by the car.
[115:37.81]Oh, I almost got hit by the car.
[115:48.71]They've got electric force fields around the perimeter.
[115:51.44]You can turn them off, though.
[115:52.84]Just shoot the machine.
[115:54.02]Thanks, mate.
[115:58.98]Wonder if I ought to go hit somebody with my nightstick.
[116:02.40]Could be fun.
[116:03.10]Alright, I gotta watch out, because those... The actual... Like, this guy right here.
[116:09.48]Is that Bert?
[116:09.92]It may be possible to turn these force fields off, Crypto.
[116:15.16]Look for something that looks like a device to control them with.
[116:18.94]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[116:22.16]Destroy the generator.
[116:22.98]There it is.
[116:23.38]Uh, I think I can do that.
[116:25.22]There's a lava fucking grenade over there.
[116:34.83]Well, eat pork.
[116:39.41]Okay, well, that ain't gonna work.
[116:42.85]I need to get rid of this thing.
[116:44.43]Can I shock him?
[117:03.86]Yeah, I guess.
[117:05.08]Well, he's caught on there.
[117:06.54]That's good.
[117:08.78]Why did he get killed?
[117:20.95]Just jump over the damn thing.
[117:31.94]Alright, it's dead.
[117:33.30]See you later.
[117:33.86]Come on in, Bert.
[117:38.50]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[117:42.96]Alright, come on, Bert.
[117:45.30]Come on, Bert.
[117:48.05]Come on, Bert.
[117:48.43]Shit, these guys are gonna see.
[117:51.95]I'm still coming in.
[118:05.34]No, what are you doing?
[118:09.86]Why is he not moving?
[118:10.80]Do I have to get on all the devices here?
[118:15.65]Oh, there's Bert.
[118:25.76]Found him.
[118:26.28]Okay, we're good.
[118:26.90]It's comedy YouTuber Jeremy985.
[118:28.28]Wait, hold on.
[118:28.72]I'm currently steeping tea right now.
[118:30.34]Don't fuck this up.
[118:31.14]Spider is still here.
[118:32.42]I don't know where he is.
[118:34.40]Comedy YouTuber.
[118:53.99]Yeah, check out my channel, guys.
[118:55.19]I've got lots of stand-up there.
[118:57.82]You know, I went to open mic night and fucking bombed.
[119:01.29]I bomb every time.
[119:06.96]Get over here!
[119:08.52]Go to the saucer!
[119:09.74]They're stupid.
[119:10.16]It's okay.
[119:10.48]Don't walk into the water, man.

[120:11.87]I just have to get a triple.
[120:13.13]These are all the slash LOL commands.
[120:35.53]Alright, somebody's head just got caved in.
[120:38.31]Somebody's head just got caved in with a sludge hammer.
[120:41.03]What are they running from?
[120:41.97]Why are they running away?
[120:43.83]What are they freaking out about?
[120:45.01]That was like... Are they freaking out because they're seeing two of us?
[121:07.93]That guy weighed a lot, apparently.
[121:10.07]What's going on?
[121:10.99]What happened?
[121:11.45]I drowned.
[121:39.17]I drowned in water that was up to my ankles?
[121:47.88]Water kills you, but... Water, that's... Electricity and water, that's not... You can't swim in games from 2005.
[121:57.82]Yeah, I know, but I can't even touch it?
[122:07.21]PS2 characters can't swim.
[122:09.22]That was very instant.
[122:18.76]I've seen the movie Signs.
[122:19.91]Yes.
[122:23.17]I... Don't touch... You touched it and walked it deep, but... Oh, goddammit.
[122:35.35]I was so... You know what that was, honest to God?
[122:37.67]That was me trying to make sure he didn't walk in the water.
[122:40.09]Alright, we're gonna speed this up.
[122:52.40]I'm so annoyed right now.
[122:53.04]He's holding him fucking underwater.
[122:55.02]Hold his head underwater.
[122:55.88]Oh, Burt with her!
[122:56.94]Burt!
[123:25.21]I'm gonna fucking die.
[123:29.07]My mind says Rock Hudson, but my body... You can take a human form, can't ya?
[123:34.17]You can get over there in disguise.
[123:36.39]Only one disguise will do, though.
[123:38.69]Crypto, be very careful.
[123:41.19]This area appears to be heavily fortified.
[123:43.59]It's him just saying that and talking to himself.
[123:48.68]Look at me again, punk.
[123:50.90]I dare ya.
[123:51.98]I double dare ya.
[123:52.74]Fuck me.
[123:53.54]I double dog dare ya.
[123:55.12]Fuck me.
[123:55.42]No, I'm going to die again.
[123:56.38]Oh, God.
[123:56.64]Damn it.
[123:56.90]It wasn't.
[123:57.20]I'm just trying to rush it.
[123:58.40]Come on.
[123:58.62]Come on.
[123:59.26]Come on.
[123:59.70]Come on.
[124:23.28]Alright, safety.
[124:23.78]Alright, we're good.
[124:25.12]There you go.
[124:26.02]Hi, Bert.
[124:52.38]Start shooting them?
[124:53.10]That's right.
[124:53.74]Alright, now let's play this cautiously.
[124:56.18]Let's bring it on.
[124:57.40]Okay, go to the saucer.
[125:14.75]I gotta be ready.
[125:15.75]Oh, fuck me!
[125:16.29]Just calm down, dude.
[125:17.76]What are you doing?
[125:18.66]Don't run in the water.
[125:19.86]How's that guy still alive?
[125:21.22]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[125:27.74]Safety.
[125:47.05]Don't lose Bert.
[125:51.67]Don't do it.
[125:52.11]This is where I died.
[125:53.11]Alright, calm down.
[125:53.83]Everything's good.
[126:14.92]See, that's exactly what we did.
[126:17.42]That's where I died.
[126:18.16]Well, it was either bustin' crooks or go back and get my doctorate in quantum physics.
[126:25.96]No, this is not where I died.
[126:26.88]Alright, okay.
[126:27.96]We heard the sledgehammer person.
[126:32.37]That Marilyn.
[126:32.99]A playwright and a baseball player.
[126:36.23]That little minx.
[126:36.75]No, it was right here.
[126:37.51]This is where it was.
[126:38.23]Centerfold girls have all the fun.
[126:44.62]I got married yesterday and now I have the seven minute itch.
[126:47.86]And I want to scratch it, baby.
[126:49.52]Yowza, yowza.
[126:51.12]Pick up the car.
[126:53.34]Too far away, damn it.
[127:00.50]Turn the car.
[127:01.42]Turn the car.
[127:02.46]You can't turn the car.
[127:03.92]You stupid.
[127:05.11]What are you doing, dummy?
[127:10.99]Don't fall in the water again!
[127:12.27]I almost just hit it again.
[127:14.39]I can't believe that it was right here.
[127:18.37]This is the end, Ryder.
[127:20.17]I'm s- I cannot believe it.
[127:23.29]I can't believe it.
[127:25.12]We were right there?
[127:34.96]Just needed to walk another 15 feet.
[127:37.10]Oh well.
[127:40.93]I need DNA.
[127:42.47]I need DNA bad.
[127:45.55]Is there anything right here I can do?
[127:49.11]Close enough where I can just get to it right now?
[127:52.01]Let's suck some brains out.
[127:53.83]Or let's do some anal probes.
[127:54.83]Suck him out.
[127:56.79]Didn't hit him.
[128:10.42]Uh, can I not get this?
[128:14.56]Well... We're gonna have to do it this way instead.
[128:19.87]I... Fuck off.
[128:23.81]Let's go.
[128:24.47]Time to leave.
[128:29.05]Get me out of here.
[128:33.40]Too tight.
[128:34.96]I just read that out loud.
[128:35.74]Whoops.
[128:42.51]Can't aim.
[128:43.29]It's not about aiming.
[128:44.15]I hit that guy like four times.
[128:51.18]I have to do a little bit of a kind of a grind run here.
[128:54.62]Thousand DNA, 750.
[128:58.84]Let's go on a DNA run.
[129:02.34]Whatever is here, we're going to do the mission and then we'll do the... We'll stick around and try to get over a thousand.
[129:09.26]It has to kill them for their brain to pop.
[129:10.84]But those guys take too many hits with that thing.
[129:17.33]I only hit him twice?
[129:18.21]I hit him four times.
[129:22.09]You say two, I say four.
[129:23.47]The success of the broadcast depends on you, Crypto.
[129:26.41]You must protect those towering transmission towers.
[129:31.83]Each tower has a transmitter at its base.
[129:34.35]If the army want to stop the broadcast, they'll have to take out those transmitters first.
[129:41.92]Alright.
[129:44.60]Remain tight-lipped over content of news special.
[129:47.56]A lot of people
[129:56.06]You can never beat this mission as a kid.
[129:58.42]That means that me as an adult is going to have even more trouble.
[130:11.39]Regiments two and four, form up at the main junction.
[130:14.23]One and three, take the flank.
[130:17.55]My microphone is low?
[130:18.49]I have it turned up pretty high.
[130:20.11]It's weird.
[130:20.83]This mission is difficulty of the train level in GTA San Andreas.
[130:24.41]Oh god, I'm not happy about this.
[130:26.19]We just start here.
[130:26.83]Starting now.
[130:49.67]Defend the TV station.
[130:55.79]That's tower two.
[130:56.69]Alright.
[130:57.40]I didn't know which one was one and two.
[130:58.46]I'm not going to use anything yet.
[131:12.49]Tower 1.
[131:12.69]Oh god.
[131:13.17]Is it?
[131:13.39]Are you sure?
[131:13.81]Are we doing good?
[131:14.53]So far?
[131:38.64]I'm gonna have to do a detonation here.
[131:39.88]He bounced off me.
[131:41.80]I'm so angry.
[131:43.42]So many people coming in.
[131:47.56]Oh, oh, oh.
[131:47.86]Cane lightning, gonna get these people.
[132:01.71]Who's left?
[132:02.15]No!
[132:02.39]Can I hurt my own tower?
[132:04.21]I really hope not.
[132:06.63]I'm gonna save the- there's a lot of cool explosions there.
[132:32.15]Here we go.
[132:33.33]I'm gonna pick one of these up
[132:41.39]That didn't work.
[132:42.43]That did not work as intended, okay.
[132:44.21]What the fuck you do to me?
[132:45.71]Shoot the thing!
[133:17.97]Give me the shield!
[133:18.79]Give me the shield!
[133:26.89]Why are you going that far over there?
[133:31.97]Oh, fuck, man.
[133:33.22]This is...
[133:43.10]How many more?
[133:43.96]One more tank.
[133:44.68]It's on its goddamn side.
[133:45.84]I'm back at full health.
[133:52.13]Another tank.
[133:54.71]There's two tanks there.
[133:56.93]Two.
[133:57.99]Count them.
[133:59.43]Shoot.
[133:59.99]Shoot so I can dodge.
[134:01.78]Oh, fuck.
[134:16.34]Wah!
[134:22.51]That was way more difficult than I really thought that was going to be.
[134:28.79]Never mind.
[134:29.17]It's not over.
[134:32.80]It's a very sturdy house.
[134:33.58]Gotta get some mech warriors now.
[134:35.28]This is bullshit.
[134:36.50]Get him up!
[134:37.50]Get him over!
[134:37.78]Get him out!
[134:48.44]Okay, they're not that... They're more bark than bite.
[134:50.70]I need more health.
[134:51.24]Oh my goddammit.
[135:14.15]Get me out of that one I Thought I was dead with that direct hit there that would have been terrible I
[135:43.89]The tanks are way worse than the robots.
[135:45.23]They kind of just walk forward.
[135:53.44]Am I going to watch the Bethesda livestream?
[135:55.10]No.
[135:56.16]I am not going to.
[135:58.14]I'm going to... try to get something ready for Tuesday.
[136:07.13]I have something to try to accomplish by...
[136:14.08]What the hell is going on here?
[136:21.23]I need DNA.
[136:24.65]I wasn't really able to stop this.
[136:34.30]Give me DNA.
[136:35.68]No, let's just get out of here.
[136:37.90]I need to get out of here.
[136:39.30]Run away.
[136:39.92]Go do a mission.
[136:42.64]If I die here, am I going to have to start the whole thing over?
[136:52.61]Let's do one of these missions.
[137:00.53]Remember when I lied about buying a clown car and I never did it?
[137:04.68]What are you talking about?
[137:06.80]You do realize I'm going to be living in Las Vegas.
[137:10.32]What do you think the first thing I'm going to do?
[137:11.60]You know, actually, I tried to buy a clown car.
[137:14.12]They don't sell them here.
[137:16.40]You know how easy it's going to be for me to drive around a clown car in Las Vegas?
[137:23.45]There are like 200 clowns per person in Las Vegas.
[137:31.14]There is like 0.02 clowns per 100 person in Massachusetts.
[137:38.02]You don't understand how difficult that is.
[137:42.07]Alright, 16 female humans.
[137:45.33]Let's go.
[137:48.97]That's not a female.
[137:49.95]Those are not females.
[137:56.29]That's a female.
[137:58.57]Two.
[138:00.27]Of course the tank is over here.
[138:01.35]I don't know.
[138:04.41]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[138:05.57]This whole place is lit up.
[138:10.33]Not when I get fucking air shot.
[138:11.83]No.
[138:14.65]Oh, the whole military is here.
[138:16.57]There's no way I'm gonna be able to do this.
[138:29.81]Down this street, anybody?
[138:35.39]Don't shoot me out of the air.
[138:36.31]I'm in a perfect view from him.
[138:39.63]No way.
[138:40.12]This ain't happening.
[138:41.04]No, I'm just going to load.
[138:44.66]Let's return him out of the ship.
[138:46.58]I'm going to load another area and just go do some missions.
[138:54.99]Does anybody know when I'm moving to Las Vegas?
[138:57.93]In like two months.
[138:59.89]Hopefully within the next 30 to 60 days.
[139:00.89]Alright, let's go back here and do those missions.
[139:09.86]The goal is to try to be out of this place by... At the very latest, September 1st.
[139:20.75]That is worst case scenario.
[139:23.61]The last place.
[139:26.85]Last time frame.
[139:29.26]Alright, where are the missions?
[139:32.90]I guess I could just walk around and suck brains for like five minutes.
[139:35.64]Yeah, I'll do that.
[139:41.25]Why am I moving?
[139:43.25]Alright, we'll go over this another time.
[139:46.14]Just because I do talk about it.
[139:48.18]Not that often, but often enough where I do understand a lot of people don't catch every stream, so I'll gladly talk about it.
[139:56.52]I am moving because there are probably three or four reasons.
[140:00.97]Reason number one is the internet here is actually starting to cause a very major problem.
[140:09.38]As those of you that were here, the last time I tried to stream, it happened again.
[140:13.41]It's been a pain in the ass.
[140:16.27]I'm actually shocked that four hours have been able to go by and this still works.
[140:20.83]But that's reason number one.
[140:22.07]And you could say, hey, well, whatever.
[140:23.80]You don't have to leave Massachusetts for that.
[140:25.52]You can get better internet probably in some other place in the state.
[140:29.48]Which is true.
[140:31.20]But... Trying to put together... I had this epiphany over the last few weeks.
[140:38.06]Trying to put together a stream that doesn't... That requires more than kind of just me sitting here.
[140:47.48]Right?
[140:48.12]Right.
[140:49.56]Me just sitting here doing whatever, I do these kind of streams all the time, right?
[140:53.00]But anytime I want to do one of those more elaborate streams where some other thing happens or there's more than one person involved or... Hey, I want to take a polygraph on stream.
[141:02.49]It is... It is painful.
[141:04.83]It is so painful to try to get anything done production-wise in this state.
[141:11.39]It's almost impossible.
[141:13.73]So the theory is, going out to Las Vegas, which is only like an hour trip to Los Angeles, there's so much industry out there.
[141:22.36]If I want to take a polygraph on stream, I wouldn't have to call 15 people across four states in the Northeast.
[141:28.90]I could probably get a hold of it.
[141:30.40]You know, there's a guy that knows about... There's a horse guy.
[141:32.80]There's a polygraph guy.
[141:34.78]Yeah, there's a clown guy.
[141:36.06]Like, the whole industry is out on the West Coast.
[141:39.81]It would be so much easier to do half the things that I want to do.
[141:43.96]So, that's kind of the reason why.
[141:48.18]It's a four-hour trip.
[141:50.62]If you... I'm talking about on a plane.
[141:53.72]Vegas to LA is like an hour, maybe an hour and some change.
[141:59.59]Did I say an hour drive?
[142:01.89]Did I?
[142:02.97]Well, I meant plane.
[142:05.33]Alright, let's suck up some DNA here.
[142:14.23]Take them all.
[142:17.49]Oh lord, your brains were ripped out.
[142:19.32]What's wrong with me?
[142:21.66]Is Otto coming?
[142:23.74]Yes.
[142:23.86]Otto is coming.
[142:24.36]Alright, you know what?
[142:25.64]Just kill this guy.
[142:26.50]Just kill everybody and then suck out their brains.
[142:29.20]I can do it after the fact.
[142:43.29]Here we go.
[142:43.61]Here's a group of people I can just shot.
[142:49.29]There we go.
[142:49.85]Alright.
[142:50.41]Take him.
[143:03.65]And those of you guys that talk about, well, the trip is going to be way longer than an hour.
[143:06.37]I mean, like, TSA pre-check and it's not going to be as horrible as it probably would seem.
[143:13.90]How many more do I need?
[143:17.91]I need a lot.
[143:18.55]I need way more than I currently have.
[143:20.35]I'm going to have to go for some anal probes here.
[143:39.22]And also, Vegas is a 24-hour city.
[143:42.94]I live kind of a reverse life, where I'm not that active in the mornings.
[143:48.55]I'm not super active during the day.
[143:51.53]So, being able to... Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[143:55.39]There's a lot of shit going on right now.
[143:57.68]Pick up the car.
[143:58.26]Holy shit.
[143:58.82]Vegas is cheaper than Boston by about 50%.
[144:00.50]Boston, Massachusetts.
[144:01.36]Massachusetts in general is a very expensive place to live.
[144:25.42]And out there, it is... Some property, you could get... I could get probably two or three times what I pay for now.
[144:32.94]For 40% less than I pay for this.
[144:35.18]It's kind of insane.
[144:44.04]Not that much more.
[144:44.74]Let's go for some mayhem here, though.
[144:47.10]Mayhem points.
[144:47.66]I'm surprised the PlayStation 2 can handle that.
[145:01.43]Last anal probe.
[145:02.91]Or maybe a couple more.
[145:07.36]Didn't get that guy.
[145:11.50]Here comes the military!
[145:12.40]Get out of the way!
[145:19.56]That's a lot of people.
[145:20.86]Ooh boy!
[145:25.02]Can I get him?
[145:30.47]Oh, did I get it?
[145:31.09]Yes, I did.
[145:38.27]What the fuck?
[145:39.25]What did he?
[145:39.69]Oh, I'm beginning to run over by a car.
[145:46.13]This is it.
[145:52.35]Come on, give me his brain.
[145:56.54]Give me your brain, man.
[146:04.80]Take it out when they're dead.
[146:12.85]Alright, well, that works.
[146:16.33]Where did it go?
[146:16.77]Is it in the air?
[146:22.47]Where did his brain go?
[146:23.27]I didn't even get it.
[146:44.26]The tanks have such precision aim.
[146:46.53]Come on, man.
[146:47.53]Nobody's that good.
[146:52.73]Alright, come on down here.
[146:55.21]Give me one more dumb brain.
[146:57.41]Here we go.
[146:57.87]Take it.
[147:01.13]Goodbye.
[147:02.35]See you later.
[147:05.01]Took long enough.
[147:10.19]Speak for myself.
[147:14.30]But, yeah, I've talked about all the things that I want to do.
[147:20.97]All the ideas I've ever said to you guys.
[147:24.73]A lot of things have fallen through.
[147:27.59]Simply because they can't be done here.
[147:32.40]And it hurts me.
[147:34.02]It's painful to me.
[147:36.04]Because there's so many things that I've tried to do.
[147:41.37]contrary to maybe what some people might think I don't think everybody thinks this but when I talk about oh yeah I'm working on a project it's a big project I am there's one in particular that has we've been trying to get off the ground for almost a fucking year and it's just impossible and if it doesn't work out I'm going to tell you exactly what it is and we'll go over it what do I want
[148:11.31]Increase ammo and range of effect.
[148:13.39]Increase damage.
[148:14.11]I want this.
[148:15.03]Super death ray.
[148:17.11]Yeah.
[148:22.17]And I go over in my brain how easy some of this shit would be if I just had the necessary resources to do it.
[148:29.24]And I'm not talking about money.
[148:30.80]Just people and places and things that understand what you're trying to do.
[148:37.26]The live rumble is a perfect example of this.
[148:41.58]That was so impossible to get somebody to let us do that.
[148:47.26]People, it's just not a thing out here.
[148:52.01]I want that to be a thing of the past.
[148:56.33]I'm in slow motion because of the area that I currently am in.
[149:03.26]Now we should be able to discover what happened to Crypto 136.
[149:05.66]My scans have identified several radioactive areas in your vicinity.
[149:11.82]But there is one in particular that looks like it could be a crash site.
[149:17.37]It's too serious of a state.
[149:18.63]It's like Harvard University is here.
[149:21.95]Alright.
[149:23.03]Okay.
[149:23.53]But there are no clowns.
[149:26.51]I'll rip them a new asshole.
[149:31.56]You know, what was the last time you heard of a Massachusetts clown?
[149:35.71]I don't know, I keep bringing it back to clowns, but you understand.
[149:38.75]The word clown is a code word for, like, the industry, right?
[149:45.75]Hope you understand that.
[149:50.32]What's the goal with this one?
[149:54.51]Collect the puzzle piece.
[149:55.33]What happened to these guys?
[149:57.01]Why did that happen?
[150:23.21]These guys trip on rocks and die?
[150:24.95]I'm too busy paying attention to this.
[150:30.86]I don't know.
[150:31.28]Something's dangerous.
[150:32.62]Snakes?
[150:32.98]No, there's no snakes over here.
[150:34.68]Motherfucker!
[150:49.92]They're clipping into the ground right here.
[150:52.37]Hmm.
[150:59.85]Well, this is where they both died.
[151:02.75]From nothing, I guess.
[151:03.77]Weird.
[151:05.01]Let's collect this dumb thing.
[151:08.66]Pick it up and fly away.
[151:13.66]Holy fuck, there's like a hundred people over here.
[151:18.12]What are those?
[151:18.46]Are these landmines?
[151:25.52]Yeah, they are.
[151:26.10]Those are landmines.
[151:26.80]Okay.
[151:33.78]Okay.
[151:35.75]Watch out for that guy.
[151:42.07]I can drop in from here.
[151:43.13]Whoa!
[151:43.61]There's a SAM site over here.
[151:45.19]Do not step near that.
[151:46.41]Alright, I'm going to PK this dude.
[151:51.36]Too far away for that.
[151:54.21]Ready to pick up.
[151:55.55]Get that.
[151:56.11]Keep going.
[151:56.79]Oh, don't be so overzealous about this.
[151:59.95]Pull him in.
[152:02.47]Push him out.
[152:24.52]No, I want to disguise as him, not... Okay, I gotta stop throwing people into the mines.
[152:36.74]Like, that's a good use of my time.
[152:45.57]I missed.
[152:45.93]Are they gonna look over here?
[152:50.07]Just chill for a second, don't worry, you're good.
[153:00.83]Are you serious?
[153:01.47]It went over his head.
[153:02.63]How did that happen?
[153:08.76]What is shooting machine gun at me?
[153:10.62]Alright, fuck it.
[153:12.94]Just get him.
[153:20.93]It's one of those things that... Excuse me.
[153:30.11]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[153:35.04]Possible enemy activity.
[153:36.18]All patrols report any suspicious occurrences, no matter how insignificant they seem.
[153:46.65]He's not... These things don't even kill anybody.
[153:48.65]Uh-oh, I need brain, brain, brain, brain, brain.
[153:52.97]Give me brain.
[153:55.47]Thank you.
[153:56.25]I hate marching.
[153:57.41]These boots suck.
[154:02.91]Alright.
[154:04.67]One guy there.
[154:07.23]They didn't see me, right?
[154:11.28]As long as nobody sees you, do it.
[154:14.00]It doesn't matter.
[154:19.34]Yep.
[154:20.00]Please keep targeting these things.
[154:21.26]Because that's what I wanted to do.
[154:24.26]Alright, I'm going for it.
[154:27.88]Okay.
[154:35.82]Traction.
[154:39.51]Oh my god.
[154:40.85]Oh my god.
[154:43.51]Oh my god, in heaven!
[154:45.55]Oh my god, in heaven!
[154:47.09]Oh my god, in heaven!
[154:49.33]Oh my god, in heaven!
[154:50.15]Where am I?
[154:50.61]Who's happening?
[154:51.93]Oh my god!
[154:52.53]This is fucking hard.
[155:09.65]Shit.
[155:19.22]I wish I didn't have to do the whole thing over again.
[155:20.86]You know what I mean?
[155:27.91]If I could just start at the first piece.
[155:29.49]You know what?
[155:30.31]I'm just gonna go over and just destroy that entire base.
[155:37.26]But there is one in particular that looks like it could be a crash site.
[155:43.25]It's easy if you just sneak in.
[155:44.35]Well, everybody get in there.
[155:45.35]There's like every single puzzle piece.
[155:48.54]Whatever they are.
[155:49.18]Those guys can see right through my disguise.
[155:50.98]I didn't even know this was here.
[155:53.12]I got full ammo.
[155:55.62]Okay, let's go.
[156:09.60]Let's make it quick.
[156:20.91]It's much easier if you just play it like a shooter.
[156:25.35]Nobody has time to react.
[156:30.87]What am I stuck on?
[156:32.15]Get out of the way!
[156:37.09]A few little pieces, most of it's gone.
[156:39.83]Recover any furon technology the humans may have found.
[156:43.62]And rescue Crypto 136.
[156:46.92]Monkeys probably hitched the ship to their donkeys and dragged it back to their mud village so they can worship it as a god.
[157:01.16]Okay, that takes care of that.
[157:07.88]Oh my lord.
[157:08.70]Okay, get rid of these.
[157:09.46]Don't shoot.
[157:10.14]Another one right there.
[157:11.02]Just play it smart.
[157:11.80]Take out these three dudes.
[157:44.84]There we go.
[157:45.28]Good.
[157:47.76]Remove all the threats in the perimeter.
[157:53.01]Or at least most of them.
[157:54.11]What we got down here?
[157:56.29]Alright, get rid of this building.
[158:01.69]I gotta be careful here.
[158:03.21]Let's take out this building first, because there's one in there.
[158:13.82]They don't know where I'm coming from.
[158:14.84]It's fine.
[158:30.88]Clear.
[158:31.18]Alright, don't go in there yet.
[158:32.30]It's dead.
[158:38.71]Another one right there.
[158:40.43]I'm gonna run out of these bullets.
[158:54.62]direct hit alright that's gone there's another one over there I think I'm safe was it did I miss it was it bullets up here yeah okay only 25 but should be more than enough
[159:13.02]Pipe god.
[159:23.76]Couple dudes right here.
[159:30.33]No.
[159:30.81]No, wait.
[159:31.93]Wait a second.
[159:36.59]Okay.
[159:37.55]Just give me a minute.
[159:38.81]Give me a second.
[159:42.96]I need to disguise as one of these guys.
[159:45.22]Alright.
[159:46.68]Everything's gonna be fine.
[159:49.62]Just go in here.
[159:51.56]Watch out for the people.
[159:55.43]No, open the gate.
[159:58.95]Open this door.
[160:00.81]Open it!
[160:05.43]How did I not get in this?
[160:07.71]How did I not get in the door?
[160:09.06]How did I not get in there?
[160:10.70]What is happening?
[160:11.44]What's wrong with me?
[160:17.34]Why is that guy invisible?
[160:20.08]I have to take this thing out.
[160:29.06]I just hurt myself somehow.
[160:33.74]Bounce, come on.
[160:35.32]It's not close.
[160:43.17]Got it.
[160:43.41]Alright.
[160:45.44]There's another one right there.
[160:55.40]Okay.
[160:59.08]What?
[160:59.70]Who's this?
[161:00.02]How is there... Oh, no.
[161:02.16]It's one of those dumb things.
[161:02.95]Okay.
[161:03.93]I can't move it.
[161:05.99]Alright.
[161:06.39]I think I can fly over here now.
[161:08.11]At least right here.
[161:18.63]Alright, I'm disguised.
[161:20.21]Watch out for the guys, the men in black.
[161:21.71]There's so many people over there.
[161:52.71]I just wanted it!
[161:53.58]I just- I needed to get it!
[161:55.28]Don't blow up.
[161:55.76]This thing's gonna blow up, isn't it?
[161:58.74]I'm just making myself a giant target.
[162:02.94]Come on, you glory hounds!
[162:08.65]You wanna live forever?
[162:09.47]Then stop that little commie!
[162:18.18]I want those commies in vain already!
[162:19.84]I wanna shoot me some reds!
[162:29.09]Kill him!
[162:30.33]Shoot him!
[162:33.15]Shoot him!
[162:34.69]I sound like a fucking terrible supervillain.
[162:44.48]Alright, one more and that's it.
[162:54.44]Gotta make this count.
[163:00.22]Oh, silky smooth.
[163:08.60]Tank over here.
[163:09.08]I need to disguise again.
[163:09.94]I can't disguise as that guy.
[163:15.40]Come on, really?
[163:18.26]Shit.
[163:20.56]Alright, just make it across.
[163:23.14]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[163:28.45]One of those guys.
[163:31.33]Oh, here comes a group of those dudes, but I think I'll be alright.
[163:33.77]I'll get up there before they show up.
[163:39.09]Get it!
[163:42.54]Locate Crypto 136?
[163:46.04]What are they referring to?
[163:51.34]Hold on here.
[164:03.52]He's in here?
[164:04.20]I need to hide again.
[164:12.49]You dickhead.
[164:13.29]No secret service, guys.
[164:24.43]I sure hope nobody noticed I fell asleep on guard duty after lunch.
[164:30.15]No, he's not even in here.
[164:31.67]Okay, well, he's out here.
[164:33.24]Apparently.
[164:33.54]Strangely enough.
[164:36.00]I'm so mad right now.
[165:00.99]I need that brain.
[165:04.62]I want those brains.
[165:08.08]Not even worth it.
[165:09.06]Look at this shit.
[165:10.20]I'll be in so much trouble if I try to get these.
[165:12.92]Can I get it?
[165:14.22]There's so many... No.
[165:16.62]Yeah, get it.
[165:22.64]Disguised again.
[165:23.40]Here we go.
[165:26.47]This mission is really long and I don't want to screw this up.
[165:29.51]I don't want to die.
[165:31.77]God damn it.
[165:32.67]I have to take the disguise off because I have to fucking know how many of these cards there are.
[165:39.69]There's so many cards.
[165:49.10]I tried to take it before he just... I guess I can destroy this thing.
[166:01.02]Oh, that's great.
[166:05.25]I... Oh my god.
[166:09.71]I have no ammo.
[166:10.49]I got no ammo for anything.
[166:11.95]I'm going to have to go back in the ship.
[166:14.91]I think I have to go in the ship.
[166:17.75]I'm not sure this is a reality here, guys.
[166:19.11]Oh.
[166:29.95]There's nothing up there.
[166:36.57]Rescue 136.
[166:37.11]Oh, doh, doh, doh, doh, doh.
[166:44.41]What is this?
[166:44.93]It's nothing.
[166:47.07]Is it health?
[166:50.29]More like that side step.
[166:59.24]I tried to... Oh no, guys!
[167:12.03]Is there any ammo anywhere?
[167:13.15]I gotta go up on top, but I'm gonna get sniped.
[167:22.19]This is where all the ammo is.
[167:24.33]Alright, here we go.
[167:25.49]I gotta make this count.
[167:29.36]I have to take out these stupid radar rays.
[167:33.14]Any more ammo on this roof.
[167:35.55]We're going to find it.
[167:39.93]I think that's all I got.
[167:42.79]Three detonators.
[167:44.19]Okay, I can go over there.
[167:51.90]Let's go for...
[167:55.43]I mean, I have to take out the ionizer, right?
[167:58.77]Whatever the hell that thing is.
[167:59.73]Wait, here we go.
[168:00.97]They respawn.
[168:01.63]Alright, this is good.
[168:03.77]I'm going to camp this.
[168:06.66]Where's my health going down?
[168:21.74]There we go.
[168:22.14]That's what I needed to do.
[168:24.51]Camping this.
[168:28.84]There we go.
[168:29.32]Yeah, you think I'm gonna move from this spot?
[168:31.74]Yeah, do you mind?
[168:32.62]Is that hitting?
[168:33.58]It is.
[168:34.52]Okay, good.
[168:35.38]Shit.
[168:57.72]I'm playing this so boring.
[168:59.57]I don't want to start the whole mission over so we're gonna do it very boring.
[169:02.85]You can just call me Mr. Boring right now because I'm not gonna lose this.
[169:09.31]This is a long mission.
[169:16.96]Are there any more?
[169:17.58]I can't tell.
[169:21.60]I mean there's those things.
[169:23.58]Let's get rid of these.
[169:27.06]Four shots.
[169:34.28]Okay.
[169:35.75]Wait for another resupply.
[169:37.41]I didn't see.
[169:41.89]Is there two more on the other sides?
[169:45.41]I don't think there are.
[169:48.40]No, I think it's just those two.
[169:49.30]Alright.
[169:51.56]I think... Is the gate open?
[169:52.70]Let's just make sure the gate's open.
[169:54.36]It's not.
[169:54.80]Gate is not open.
[169:57.18]Where's the shut off button?
[170:01.49]Give me one more of these.
[170:04.19]I want it bad.
[170:04.97]Alright, I'm ready.
[170:11.77]I can retreat to the building.
[170:13.47]The roof of this building, that is.
[170:15.28]Ow.
[170:15.98]Ow.
[170:27.37]Alright, what's up?
[170:35.54]How do I open?
[170:36.06]We're good?
[170:38.86]Alright, thank god.
[170:46.68]New playable character?
[170:47.38]Is that what we're gonna get here?
[171:06.01]How is the Bethesda conference going to be two hours?
[171:07.53]I really thought you'd be alive.
[171:11.46]Ah, Crypto.
[171:12.92]Look what they've done to us.
[171:15.32]Laid us open like an animal.
[171:17.92]How could intelligent creatures do this?
[171:24.11]Okay, monkeys.
[171:26.23]You want a war?
[171:28.21]You've got a war.
[171:30.31]No, I know we're all Cryptos.
[171:33.47]What?
[171:34.49]What did you find, Crypto?
[171:36.26]Okay, okay, okay, okay Seriously, I got sucked up in a fan I'm freaking out right now.
[171:43.58]I don't want to lose this destroy everything.
[171:48.38]Oh
[172:07.23]Return to the saucer.
[172:13.46]Jesus Christ.
[172:18.02]Skyrim demastered.
[172:19.12]They're going to put it on Super Nintendo.
[172:22.90]Just walk on out.
[172:24.34]Back to the saucer.
[172:25.10]A lot of skidding.
[172:34.27]That guy's tires out.
[172:45.81]Shit, what am I doing?
[172:46.77]Please, I don't want to do this again.
[172:54.80]I couldn't disguise quick enough.
[172:57.44]Just walk.
[172:58.80]Just walk there.
[172:59.36]I don't have to...
[173:20.24]Don't you dare.
[173:22.26]Okay.
[173:23.60]Walk right through the front door.
[173:26.02]Just get out of here.
[173:34.42]Bang it right.
[173:36.26]Watch out for the trucks.
[173:37.12]Everything's fine.
[173:37.82]These guys get out, but they're not the secret agents.
[173:41.10]I thought it was going to say WWF.
[173:51.24]Man, this is just like the WWF.
[173:52.30]I love it.
[173:53.16]If Fallout 76 is a Battle Royale game, you're gonna take a shot.
[174:16.84]They came out of nowhere.
[174:19.28]They came out of nowhere and they blew everything.
[174:27.53]You're already drinking?
[174:30.83]Bethesda has pushed you to drink.
[174:37.79]I sincerely cannot.
[174:39.65]There are magnets.
[174:50.38]Alright.
[174:50.66]I think we're in the clear.
[174:56.73]It's not going to be a... From that trailer, that did not look anything like a Battle Royale game.
[175:11.42]That missed completely.
[175:16.50]Why are these things back?
[175:18.62]These things should be dead.
[175:22.23]Too far away, right?
[175:24.13]Yeah.
[175:25.86]There's the ship.
[175:27.16]Wait.
[175:27.70]Didn't quite make it yet.
[175:30.24]Not yet, at least.
[175:30.90]Hold on.
[175:31.96]What is shooting?
[175:33.58]What is shooting over here?
[175:34.34]What was that?
[175:35.02]Why is there a tank over here?
[175:46.23]Just complete the mission, please.
[175:48.35]Okay.
[175:48.79]Go.
[175:48.87]Okay.
[175:49.85]Okay.
[176:02.01]That's the loudest whisper scream I've ever done.
[176:05.38]Alright, now that I can do this.
[176:11.46]In peace.
[176:13.78]Here are the brains.
[176:26.39]It's safe.
[176:27.89]Nothing to worry about.
[176:30.86]There is one more thing over here.
[176:32.30]I don't know what it is, though.
[176:33.14]Is there a guy right here?
[176:34.50]No, it's a mine.
[176:36.46]Alright.
[176:38.10]Don't have to do it again.
[176:39.87]Am I going to play the sequel to this game?
[176:41.07]Probably, yeah.
[176:43.35]I don't think I'll play the Path of the Fuhrer on the door, dude.
[176:55.32]How do you play this on PC?
[176:58.10]I don't think you do.
[176:58.62]This is a PlayStation 2 game that is currently available
[177:15.21]for... What is making... Okay, I was gonna say, that's weird.
[177:22.96]You can get it for PS4.
[177:24.52]It's on PS Now.
[177:25.36]It's in 1080p version, which is the one we're playing here.
[177:30.60]So, if you have a PS4, you can play it.
[177:34.03]Or you can pull out your old PS2.
[177:37.15]I am actually gonna do one of these missions.
[177:41.89]I need more DNA.
[177:49.82]It's $20 for this one and $20 for the next one.
[177:59.32]Destroy all humans 2 is literally destroy all humans, but better in every aspect.
[178:04.62]So I'm told.
[178:05.99]But... I mean, I gotta at least check out the original, right?
[178:10.83]Can't just skip right to 2.
[178:16.07]Destroy what is left of the human base.
[178:17.47]2 minutes and 45 seconds.
[178:18.87]Let's try it.
[178:23.45]I did increase the damage of this thing, so this shouldn't take too long.
[178:25.57]Kind of wasting time right here, but that's okay.
[178:44.04]Worth playing the first one before two so you don't get annoyed.
[178:46.60]What's annoying in the second one that I've been preparing myself for?
[178:49.50]What, just needing to know how to play the game?
[178:56.54]Well, that was embarrassing, but we're fine.
[179:00.88]Oh.
[179:01.70]My.
[179:02.52]Fucking.
[179:02.98]God.
[179:04.88]There are... So I don't think I'm doing this one.
[179:12.09]Uh-huh.
[179:13.55]Mm-hmm.
[179:17.99]Well.
[179:20.29]We're...
[179:23.30]In some trouble.
[179:24.52]Here we go.
[179:25.82]I'm not gonna do this shit, are you kidding me?
[179:39.55]Goddamn!
[179:42.27]Oh my lord!
[179:48.07]Oh, just too many?
[179:54.03]See that play right there?
[179:57.18]It's gonna be for nothing though, because if I take like two more hits, I'm dead.
[180:00.26]Sit right here for a second.
[180:05.34]Fuck you.
[180:11.72]His face is ridiculous.
[180:17.21]I got a little bit of health here.
[180:18.19]Look at this.
[180:33.34]30 seconds, come on now.
[180:37.51]What do we got?
[180:45.47]Two more back here?
[180:46.75]One building right here, come on.
[180:50.06]Last building, 14 seconds, it's right here!
[180:52.06]I got him.
[181:06.68]Come on, go ahead.
[181:09.58]525.
[181:09.64]Alright, I need... Maybe do... We'll go back now.
[181:17.45]It's safe to go back.
[181:22.11]Still a half an hour before Bethesda.
[181:23.58]Maybe I will just stream Bethesda.
[181:25.28]Like, you know, who gives a shit?
[181:28.36]What else, you know?
[181:33.02]I probably won't stream the Sony conference tomorrow.
[181:38.14]Or at least maybe like the first half.
[181:40.34]We'll see when we get there.
[181:41.60]What is it?
[181:41.88]Like in like 20, 30 minutes?
[181:42.50]I'm definitely going to have to pee.
[181:48.62]I'm going to have to go to the bathroom again.
[181:49.86]Step right up.
[181:51.88]Alien upgrades it is.
[181:53.82]Step inside my shop.
[181:55.50]I swear to God, man.
[181:57.51]Increased ammo for the ion detonator.
[182:00.63]That's good.
[182:03.85]Pick up tanks and robots.
[182:05.71]That's worth saving.
[182:07.84]I'm going to save for that.
[182:14.24]Yeah, let's stream the Bethesda conference.
[182:16.08]I mean, my internet is still fine.
[182:19.02]Let's just do it.
[182:19.52]You know what?
[182:19.80]Who cares?
[182:23.52]Wait, you actually can't stream Bethesda.
[182:25.08]I can't?
[182:26.88]Really?
[182:28.52]Says who?
[182:29.76]It's not going to be on the official Twitch thing?
[182:33.74]What?
[182:33.92]What do you mean?
[182:38.58]There's no hurry.
[182:39.46]Humanity's certainly not going anywhere.
[182:41.42]Oh, I got like an email from Twitch telling me what I could stream.
[182:51.90]Oh.
[182:58.48]If it's not in the schedule below, the content is likely not streamable.
[183:11.07]I don't know if I can stream this.
[183:20.87]Everybody else is doing it?
[183:21.87]I don't know.
[183:24.79]The Bethesda conference is not listed here.
[183:28.79]On things that are okay to stream.
[183:33.32]Twitch staff here?
[183:34.68]Anybody's staff here?
[183:36.71]It's in the schedule?
[183:38.03]I don't see it on the schedule.
[183:39.67]Not in my like partner email.
[183:43.47]This like email to, you know, Twitch E3 show schedule.
[183:46.77]If it's not on this schedule, don't stream it.
[183:49.55]Is what this says.
[183:54.59]Apparently.
[183:57.35]Todd Howard will personally shut the stream down.
[184:06.66]Let's see if I can hit this guy.
[184:07.68]Let's see.
[184:07.88]Let's get a DM going here.
[184:08.96]Just watch my face talk about it.
[184:37.01]Let's see if I can get a response here.
[184:38.67]That's weird.
[184:39.77]I wonder why I wouldn't be on the list here.
[184:50.18]Okay, well.
[184:53.73]Just reactions.
[184:58.35]Okay, apparently it is.
[184:59.75]Yeah, it is.
[185:00.29]Okay, so we're good.
[185:08.13]That was fucking quick.
[185:09.53]That was quick.
[185:10.77]That was an instant reply.
[185:12.95]Look at that fucking support here.
[185:14.34]Alright, so we'll just go strip it.
[185:25.00]Alright, so when's the pre-show?
[185:41.98]Area 42.
[185:42.32]It's in 30 minutes if I want to stream it.
[185:45.97]Alright, I'll be ready.
[185:47.27]If it's just on the Twitch co-stream, I don't know why I wouldn't be listed here, though.
[185:50.07]That's strange.
[185:50.59]Alright, well, I can't believe I turned this stream on the second the Xbox One started.
[186:01.77]Alright, let me change my title, then.
[186:05.00]Just to be ready for it.
[186:06.32]E3 2018.
[186:13.19]Bethesda.
[186:17.67]Bethesda conference.
[186:20.39]Legit reactions, you know what I mean?
[186:24.13]Real, non-faked reactions to the conference.
[186:28.45]Or should I name it Bethesda?
[186:30.97]A.K.A.
[186:31.39]Skyrim.
[186:31.69]Again.
[186:32.67]And again.
[186:33.09]Bethesda.
[186:34.05]Dash.
[186:44.90]I don't know.
[186:45.24]I don't know how to title these things.
[186:47.84]Check it out!
[186:48.20]Bethesda's conference!
[186:49.28]Real commentary!
[186:50.43]Wonder what's going to happen in this one!
[186:51.99]Check it out!
[186:52.61]Cool!
[186:53.27]Excellent!
[186:56.49]How about just... Bethesda is in Maryland.
[187:04.87]Stupid.
[187:07.54]That's even worse.
[187:13.83]Official Bethesda stream.
[187:15.69]You know, I would get fucked for that.
[187:26.15]Bethesda... Bethesda conference.
[187:30.72]I don't know, guys.
[187:31.60]Whatever.
[187:32.06]Bethesda conference dash... One of a thousand people doing this.
[187:42.13]How's that?
[187:42.65]Like Bethesda conference, one of a thousand people doing this right now.
[187:55.02]Mr. Bethesda himself.
[188:00.83]Do Bethesda is in Maryland?
[188:02.17]No.
[188:15.81]And, uh, what was that old thing?
[188:17.19]And this is in the fucking Zune.
[188:28.84]That's fine.
[188:29.38]I'm alright with that.
[188:31.82]I mean, this is a lie, but am I getting in trouble for a lie?
[188:35.32]Yeah, I like that.
[188:42.57]That's better.
[188:44.03]That's fine.
[188:46.53]Alright, so I'll be right.
[188:47.41]Let me get this ready.
[188:48.09]We'll do one more mission and get it ready.
[189:03.10]The Mutant Menace.
[189:03.98]It looks like 47.
[189:05.60]The data tape you retrieved from the human research lab has revealed the most disturbing development.
[189:11.68]They've unlocked the dormant psychic ability hidden deep in their primitive brains.
[189:16.60]Elder Todd's 76.
[189:17.54]Normie issues uninformed game criticism.
[189:26.16]What?
[189:26.50]Humans using Furon powers.
[189:29.84]They're training these mutant humans for use in the battle against us.
[189:34.39]Destroy everything in their lab.
[189:36.11]All of them.
[189:37.09]All of the humans.
[189:37.85]Destroy them.
[189:39.09]Destroy the lab.
[189:42.93]You got it.
[189:43.99]Okay, okay, okay.
[189:46.53]Okay, okay.
[189:48.11]Okay.
[189:51.38]Here's a close encounter of the...
[189:58.07]Fuck outta here.
[190:04.25]Alright, let's get around.
[190:11.11]You know, I need like another tea before we do a Bethesda conference.
[190:14.39]You know?
[190:14.63]Anybody else feel that way?
[190:16.59]You guys need like a tea as well?
[190:18.21]You better go get one.
[190:19.23]I'm gonna go do like an extra long piss.
[190:21.13]Get up there, please.
[190:29.59]Alright.
[190:31.78]So.
[190:32.70]I have to destroy everything.
[190:35.54]Let's do the same tactic that we did before.
[190:42.28]I don't have to do this, but it's fun to do.
[190:45.81]Why am I doing that?
[190:46.73]It's not even worth it.
[190:47.61]Just destroy this.
[190:48.63]Blow up this building, right?
[190:51.67]What was the mission?
[190:53.33]Enter the Majestic Lab.
[190:54.29]Okay.
[190:55.18]Sure.
[190:58.05]Did I just do this?
[191:02.23]I just did this.
[191:02.79]Alright, here we go.
[191:03.65]Did I just break it?
[191:04.79]Did I break the glass?
[191:07.07]How do I get in here?
[191:29.07]I had like 10 years to finish that guy.
[191:31.83]I gotta go up and through the tube.
[191:37.55]Lie.
[191:38.15]Lies.
[191:38.63]Lies.
[191:39.15]Oh, I thought that said lies.
[191:41.31]Never mind.
[191:41.71]You asshole.
[191:45.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[191:46.89]You come here.
[191:47.23]Come here.
[191:47.47]Come here.
[191:47.67]Deactivate the shield, dummy.
[192:01.82]I didn't want to kill him, did I?
[192:02.86]No.
[192:07.46]He's preparing for the Bethesda conference.
[192:13.58]Through here.
[192:14.64]Pick it up.
[192:14.95]Is that a Half-Life weapon?
[192:21.11]Holy God, I murdered that guy.
[192:23.91]So bad that he disappeared.
[192:25.29]Destroy the PSI mutants.
[192:27.05]They got mutants, alright.
[192:35.73]Okay, well they have these psychic units.
[192:38.99]He's dead.
[192:47.05]Watch, he's going to make the floor lava.
[192:48.13]Don't touch it.
[192:48.51]Okay, now go.
[192:54.07]Scan his brain.
[192:54.65]I'm curious what he thinks.
[192:59.46]Not very much going on in that room.
[193:00.70]Okay.
[193:04.02]Put it down.
[193:04.56]Put the shield down.
[193:05.12]Come on.
[193:08.80]Get rid of the dado.
[193:12.00]It's time to give these inquisitive humans a little negative reinforcement.
[193:17.02]They're entirely too clever for their own good.
[193:20.37]Inputrate the research base and disable its defenses from within.
[193:23.81]Hey, what up, guys?
[193:24.65]Then you will destroy the entire area with your soul.
[193:30.47]Now I have to get rid of the coils, of course.
[193:36.28]Alright.
[193:38.43]Somebody has to give me $100.
[193:40.31]If Todd Howard grabs the mic, comes out and goes, Hey, what's up, party people?
[193:46.40]That's worth $100, right?
[193:49.58]Like, me predicting that he's going to do that?
[193:52.58]If he does that line, everybody here owes me $100.
[194:04.37]Distance.
[194:05.83]Come on.
[194:06.69]Distance minus speed equals square root.
[194:13.17]God damn it.
[194:17.44]Bingo!
[194:18.12]Not even close.
[194:25.06]One.
[194:25.34]He's got backhand.
[194:37.97]Oh, god damn it.
[194:38.87]Fucking robots.
[194:42.47]If not, I have to pay all of you guys $100.
[194:44.22]Alright.
[194:46.44]If Todd Howard does not come out and grab the mic and go, Hey, what's up, party people?
[194:50.50]I will pay everybody here $100.
[194:52.72]No!
[194:53.52]I'm not going to do that.
[194:54.30]That's a joke.
[194:54.98]That's funny, right?
[194:59.19]What is that?
[194:59.49]$30,000?
[194:59.51]$37,000?
[194:59.53]$370,000. $370,000.
[195:06.94]Well, that wouldn't be worth it.
[195:10.74]Imagine me making that bet, and everybody here agreed to it.
[195:13.74]That's a risk.
[195:20.29]Oh my god, eat it.
[195:22.57]Eat my fucking ass.
[195:23.85]Seriously, now I can't destroy it.
[195:25.53]I'm gonna have to throw shit at it the whole time now.
[195:36.55]These guys will get electrocuted by that, won't they?
[195:41.27]Yeah, they will.
[195:42.13]What the fuck are the cars at this thing?
[195:51.60]God damn it!
[195:54.95]I need to climb back.
[195:57.07]What is all this shit?
[195:59.67]What the hell is going on here?
[196:00.43]$37,000 a stream?
[196:01.37]You think I'd pay $37,000 a stream?
[196:03.18]Alright, unleash the hounds.
[196:29.25]Alright, take it over.
[196:29.97]Let's go.
[196:33.59]Go unleash the hounds.
[196:36.71]Okay, that didn't do anything.
[196:39.77]I need a car.
[196:40.79]Come here.
[196:43.00]I need to throw a car at this.
[196:51.08]Okay, put it down for a second so I get some better view.
[196:53.37]Ugh.
[197:15.78]What in the name?
[197:16.84]Oh, thanks for the supply!
[197:20.02]Okay!
[197:21.50]We just, now we don't have to worry about it anymore.
[197:24.48]Thanks, cow.
[197:27.67]Alright, we're going this way.
[197:35.85]Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[197:37.29]Just blow it up.
[197:43.98]One more.
[197:49.38]What's up, party people?
[197:55.00]Or, okay, how about this?
[197:56.95]He comes out and starts, he doesn't say anything.
[197:59.87]The first thing he does is he does like a wild, really embarrassing air guitar.
[198:04.63]Excellent work, Krypton.
[198:06.49]Is that worth it too?
[198:07.09]Let's get busy.
[198:11.91]He doesn't say anything.
[198:12.73]It's like the Bethesda.
[198:13.79]Here comes the Bethesda conference.
[198:15.13]Welcome Todd Howard.
[198:17.09]And he's just like, he comes out and he's all excited.
[198:19.81]And he's just like, like, he just does that for like a solid 30 seconds.
[198:23.80]That's $200 that I get.
[198:24.96]Yeah.
[198:46.00]Deal.
[198:46.30]Alright, I got a deal here.
[198:49.34]I'm gonna make $200.
[198:49.80]Oops.
[198:52.57]Oh!
[198:57.29]I'm so easy to hit right now.
[199:00.27]I slowed down at the perfect opportunity.
[199:03.01]Oh, am I still alive?
[199:04.87]I don't know, but I'm gonna make it.
[199:06.83]I'm gonna make it, guys.
[199:07.83]Oh!
[199:14.64]You actually just did that?
[199:18.17]Oh, you just saved my life, tank!
[199:20.19]I don't know what to do!
[199:25.57]Oh my god, where am I?
[199:32.82]I just got covering fire from the tank.
[199:38.58]You gonna unsub if he doesn't do either one of those things?
[199:42.36]Well, we're about to find out.
[199:48.86]Clear the... What are you doing, man?
[199:57.34]Fuck out of here.
[200:00.24]Alright, let's go.
[200:01.94]Got it.
[200:16.83]Wait, I missed 20 shots?
[200:17.75]No, those things have splash.
[200:18.71]I was spreading it out amongst the four people.
[200:22.93]Those are so specific, I'm convinced he's actually gonna do one more.
[200:26.60]I gotta have three options here though.
[200:27.98]Alright, option number three is he comes out and he does this, okay?
[200:35.44]This is more realistic and this is worth it.
[200:37.93]So he walks out on stage and he gets out there and he goes.
[200:48.43]So welcome to a big clap and a huge inhale.
[200:53.02]Like I'm kind of nervous, but like I'm going to keep it together.
[200:58.18]That's pretty, that's pretty possible.
[201:03.78]And we're going to, you know, you are going to hear it.
[201:05.17]It's going to be like.
[201:11.31]Big clap.
[201:12.27]One clap.
[201:12.77]If he does more than once, then I owe everybody 500 bucks.
[201:17.51]I'm not going to say that anymore, because we're talking about fake funny money.
[201:21.81]About real money.
[201:27.56]It's two, one, one, two, three.
[201:32.80]Yeah, we're talking about just joke money.
[201:34.84]Just because I say the word money doesn't mean it's actual money.
[201:54.18]That's it!
[202:02.44]Yeah, you guys get like 500 funny fake funny money.
[202:07.07]And speaking of which, let's get this started here.
[202:15.37]The E3 stream has a hundred thousand viewers and I have 4k?
[202:20.98]You can't compare me, you can't compare this channel to like the official E3 broadcast.
[202:27.96]What?
[202:32.55]You think I'm gonna have more viewers than the official E3 broadcast?
[202:36.49]Why would that ever happen?
[202:40.19]The only way that would be possible is if like,
[202:43.02]Todd Williams.
[202:44.62]What's his name?
[202:45.12]Todd... Todd Harris?
[202:47.79]What's this guy's name?
[202:48.61]I forgot it already.
[202:51.75]Todd... What is this guy's name?
[202:56.29]I just combined Ed Harris and Todd... Todd Howard.
[203:05.42]It's not Todd Howard.
[203:06.74]What is his name?
[203:11.24]Oh my God, it's Todd Howard.
[203:12.36]Okay.
[203:14.30]Sorry, it's been a long day.
[203:18.95]If Todd Howard was in my room, sitting next to me, and we were both like just drinking coffee, talking about his games, maybe.
[203:24.91]Alright.
[203:25.91]I'm going to go pee.
[203:26.65]Let me see if I can get this official E3 broadcast going here.
[203:31.17]I need to do this though.
[203:36.07]Zero.
[203:38.98]And take this, take the filter off of that guy, and browse it.
[203:47.18]Alright, so give me a minute.
[203:48.52]I'll be back in two seconds.
[203:49.50]I'm going to pee too, so I'll start when the... Well, I'll be back way before then, but just give me a moment.
