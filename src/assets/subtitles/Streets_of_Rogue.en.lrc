[00:01.64]Good afternoon everybody Hi I'm there the transmission works I'm able to transmit data through a wire into your house How are you?
[00:22.23]Unfortunately It's not perfect
[00:27.16]Ooh.
[00:28.64]Ooh, I feel it.
[00:29.64]I can feel it.
[00:31.02]Our internet was fixed in quotes.
[00:35.02]And what that means is it's not fixed.
[00:37.64]And they're working on it.
[00:41.78]They did something.
[00:42.45]They screwed something up.
[00:43.57]And they're trying to fix it.
[00:45.77]But unfortunately for us, we have to deal with it.
[00:52.56]Hopefully it does not drop that many times.
[00:54.70]Hopefully it doesn't drop to zero.
[00:58.94]But I gotta try, right?
[01:02.39]I can't just like, oh bye, see you later guys.
[01:04.43]I'll see you in like three weeks.
[01:07.77]I've gotta try.
[01:10.07]And this is what this stream is.
[01:13.31]We're gonna try.
[01:19.69]And Etalyx and I, because Alex is having this problem too, because he also lives here.
[01:25.20]We've been running full Twitch tests.
[01:30.08]If you didn't know, Twitch has test servers that you can just stream to.
[01:34.19]And it's a pretend fake stream.
[01:37.07]And we've been doing this for about two straight days now.
[01:40.55]And the problem is way less evident than it was three or four days ago.
[01:46.89]But, with anything, who has any idea?
[01:50.84]What may have seemed okay yesterday, for the whole day, with a few drops here and there, it was like, alright, we get a whole day of green, let's go, I'm going for it.
[02:01.52]And that's what this stream is, and then right when we turn it on, of course, it's problems.
[02:04.32]But, what do you say we talk about something?
[02:07.46]It's been a while, it's been like five, six days since I last streamed.
[02:12.26]That was not my intention.
[02:14.93]But a couple of things happened.
[02:16.89]If you didn't see, I tried to keep some of it a secret over the weekend.
[02:21.73]I was part of the Vinesauce's Hope, Joel's Vine Wrestle segment.
[02:27.55]I invaded, Jerma Wrestling Federation invaded Vine Wrestle.
[02:33.97]I didn't really talk about it because they wanted it to be a surprise.
[02:37.54]So I didn't really say much about it.
[02:42.36]I won't give you any spoilers, but if you haven't seen it,
[02:45.48]I'd recommend it.
[02:49.30]Hyphus Crossover.
[02:50.30]That was a lot of fun.
[02:51.76]And although I wasn't able to stream on my own channel, I was able to participate in that and it was awesome.
[02:57.82]For a great cause, they do that every year.
[03:00.56]And I'm just happy to participate.
[03:02.85]But yeah, I did that.
[03:04.75]We've also got a couple of ideas.
[03:10.33]For the future.
[03:14.00]And what I mean by that is... In the future... In, like... Don't do this to me.
[03:23.06]Come on.
[03:23.49]It was green, fucking, for the last, like... 15 hours.
[03:28.33]Come on, man.
[03:29.89]Come on.
[03:31.49]You gotta give this to me.
[03:33.29]It's been too long.
[03:34.27]You gotta give this to me.
[03:39.63]It's trying.
[03:41.96]But anyways...
[03:43.72]I'm just looking over here at the drop frames, and I'm just like, no, no, please don't do this to me.
[03:50.00]Please.
[03:51.21]I just want to stream.
[03:52.39]I just want to turn on my live stream.
[03:55.63]I don't know what they did, but... Besides the carnival stream, we're just going to sit here and talk for a minute because it's been a while.
[04:06.08]So besides the carnival stream, which is coming up in probably late September, there's another stream that I want to do.
[04:13.24]That would be really fun.
[04:15.33]And it involves the idea that we talked about.
[04:17.01]The Where's Waldo stream.
[04:20.83]Where somebody or people come together as a community.
[04:24.19]They make up some fun slides.
[04:25.80]Where I have to find on stream me.
[04:29.52]Green screen cutout on stream.
[04:33.23]Now, that sounds like a lot of fun.
[04:36.23]But then I thought about, you know, what would be better, instead of it just being a segment where, oh, I'm going to do like 30 Where's Waldo slides.
[04:44.59]No.
[04:45.57]I'm going to do, on this stream, I will give you, once I get everything set in stone, probably in a few weeks, I want to do an entire Highlights Magazine stream.
[04:56.07]I'm talking dot to dots, hidden objects, Where's Waldo, coloring book section.
[05:02.49]If you remember those magazines, they were ridiculous.
[05:06.00]I want to have like a ask the editor section.
[05:08.96]Where people ask me things.
[05:10.94]And it's going to be a whole highlights magazine.
[05:15.88]Now this sounds like it might be hard to do, but it won't be.
[05:19.31]It's actually probably pretty easy.
[05:22.01]So that Where's Waldo idea sort of evolved into this.
[05:28.29]And I would say at some point next week, I'm going to get some hard details done.
[05:34.15]And we will have, like, submissions for this stuff.
[05:38.86]Because I'm going to do some stuff, too.
[05:40.02]I want to, like, hire out some people to make some crazy shit.
[05:45.90]Yeah, I want it to be, like, an actual, like, book.
[05:51.11]At least mine.
[05:52.11]At least I want to do that on stream.
[05:53.51]But it actually might be better if it was all digital.
[05:55.55]I'll come up with all the hard stuff here.
[06:00.70]But that will happen probably in the next few weeks.
[06:02.70]I want to give at least a couple weeks for people to submit stuff.
[06:04.78]So next week, we'll give some deadlines there.
[06:08.48]But that would be fun to do.
[06:12.02]Is that a joke?
[06:12.86]They had a joke section.
[06:15.66]In Highlights Magazine.
[06:17.66]So I want you guys to submit your best jokes and I'm going to read them on stream.
[06:22.32]It's just going to be all copypastas.
[06:29.78]More lifelines.
[06:31.15]The -2 section.
[06:36.67]It's going to be the same coffee pasta.
[06:38.95]Will there be a cereal stream?
[06:42.83]I thought about a cereal stream, but his thing about a cereal stream... That's kind of it.
[06:49.14]You open up the boxes of cereal, you eat the cereal.
[06:52.84]And then what?
[06:54.34]That's it.
[06:56.18]What are you... What am I...
[06:58.67]That is like... I would classify eating cereal on stream... As like... Let's say there's like a content layer.
[07:06.91]Content level.
[07:08.15]From 0 to 100.
[07:09.94]That's like a 4.
[07:13.16]Sleeping on stream is probably like a 2.
[07:16.52]Streaming a black screen is a 1.
[07:20.39]You know what I'm saying?
[07:21.83]You're only like 2 or 3 notches over streaming a black screen.
[07:24.57]With no... With muted.
[07:29.66]So, I mean, maybe it might be fun.
[07:32.76]But I think I would want that to be a segment of a bigger stream.
[07:38.09]Zero is you're not live.
[07:39.37]Yeah.
[07:39.55]But anyways, we're going to play Streets of Rogue.
[07:47.09]Which is a rogue-like game.
[07:49.96]But it's also kind of an adventure game, too.
[07:53.28]Could be a bunch of other stuff.
[07:55.02]How would you know?
[07:56.58]You've never played it?
[07:57.58]Neither have I.
[07:59.66]What's a 100?
[08:00.00]Oh.
[08:02.30]Carnival stream.
[08:03.06]That's, I mean, if you were to make a carnival with Twitch-controlled robots that played games on stream, like, at least, at least, like, three, four, five of these games on stream, and, like, clowns and shit, that would say, that would probably be somewhere around 100, I think.
[08:24.68]That's my barometer.
[08:27.10]Anyways, there's also a... There's also a Twitch integration in this game.
[08:34.39]I have no idea how the hell this works, but... Let's see.
[08:41.19]Hey, there it is.
[08:42.59]Streets of Rogue, I kind of wanted to come back soft today.
[08:49.31]Because obviously, I don't know how... Essentially, I've got a blindfold on.
[08:56.30]I have no idea what's going to happen with the internet.
[08:58.40]All I know is that it's on.
[08:59.44]And I turned it on, and here we are.
[09:01.50]So there's no going back now.
[09:03.82]Unless they turn it off.
[09:04.60]And in that case, it's off, and we went back.
[09:08.66]But that's kind of the state of the update.
[09:14.91]Let's try it.
[09:15.79]Streets of Rogue.
[09:16.35]Here we go.
[09:20.18]Ban the guy below me.
[09:21.14]Why would I do that?
[09:24.28]Are we green?
[09:24.70]We're green, I think.
[09:27.16]I'm ready.
[09:27.48]Okay, this is like the tutorial.
[09:37.97]What happened before this?
[09:40.01]Elected on vague promises of lower taxes and more beer.
[09:45.78]Okay, the mayor's first executive order were a massive raise on taxes and a one-time confiscation of all alcoholic beverages.
[09:56.49]He stated that the confiscation was so he could throw the mother of all ragers for his constituents.
[10:03.44]Okay.
[10:05.31]But in reality, there was only, like, one keg and a bag of tortillas.
[10:09.11]I like this.
[10:10.35]It's already a full letter grade.
[10:12.31]But in reality, there was only, like, one keg.
[10:14.55]I like that.
[10:19.53]It was super lame.
[10:20.95]Alright, now bring it back down to full letter grade.
[10:22.47]I don't like this part.
[10:26.22]He used the money and extra booze to fund a private army of goons.
[10:29.50]Happy to carry out his every nefarious bidding.
[10:33.58]Before long, the city had fallen into a state of chaos, but there is still hope.
[10:38.77]A secretive organization known only as the Resistance has been formed to fight back against the mayor's tyrannical leadership.
[10:45.61]And that is where our tale begins.
[10:46.99]It's time to embark on your journey into the... Streets of Rogue!
[10:51.41]Is that me?
[10:57.76]I'm sure you want to join the Resistance, eh?
[11:03.81]Holy crap, you did it!
[11:16.39]I opened that door by pressing the E button.
[11:18.41]Which one?
[11:18.83]E?
[11:19.07]E. No way, no way!
[11:22.90]This is the farthest anyone's gotten in a long time.
[11:24.76]I left a little something for you in that chest.
[11:26.26]Can you figure out what to do next?
[11:29.12]This music's pretty good.
[11:31.28]E.
[11:32.87]Okay, so that's a lock pick.
[11:34.63]Pick any lock.
[11:35.51]Just don't expect the owner of said lock to appreciate it.
[11:41.49]Wow, oh my god.
[11:43.40]Haha.
[11:45.82]But there's no way that you could possibly figure out what to do with that thing.
[11:52.87]Oh, oh, haha, oh god.
[11:54.93]Alright, I got a locked door here.
[11:59.51]Uh, use the lockpick.
[12:00.25]Just one?
[12:00.69]I don't have to click it.
[12:02.79]Yeah.
[12:05.59]Holy crap, holy crap.
[12:07.57]Uh... What?
[12:15.38]Why?
[12:15.62]Oh no, he spontaneously exploded.
[12:18.80]I'm so sorry you had to see that.
[12:21.38]On the plus side, you must be doing pretty well so far for him to get that excited.
[12:25.60]He had a lot of emotional problems.
[12:27.11]Anyways, no use moping around.
[12:28.63]I'll take over from here.
[12:30.39]He's gonna explode too.
[12:31.61]Just watch.
[12:32.83]I'm teleporting you some money.
[12:34.03]Use it to buy a hacking tool from our staff shopkeeper.
[12:36.55]50 bucks?
[12:41.58]Okay, let's go.
[12:45.36]Staff shopkeeper, that's you.
[12:48.80]Oops.
[12:50.14]What are you buying?
[12:50.98]Ah, I'm buying... Hacking tool.
[12:55.52]Jesus.
[12:56.94]Single-use device that will hack into any computer remotely.
[13:00.97]Okay.
[13:03.03]Yeah, he didn't explode.
[13:03.81]Oh, he will.
[13:06.07]Access your inventory by pressing Q, then right-click the hacking tool to select it, and left-click the computer.
[13:12.45]Which computer?
[13:13.21]That one?
[13:15.55]So right-click to use, and then click on the computer.
[13:18.89]I can do it from that far away?
[13:23.75]Open locked doors.
[13:24.61]Read email.
[13:26.09]That would be rude.
[13:27.45]Ah, you're right.
[13:27.91]It would be pretty rude.
[13:29.55]Eh, don't do it.
[13:31.71]Try it again.
[13:32.12]Okay, open locked doors.
[13:34.24]Got it.
[13:35.08]Okay.
[13:37.92]So I already did that.
[13:39.82]Is this as fast as I can move?
[13:41.62]What's E?
[13:42.54]Entrance.
[13:43.62]Alright, so I'm at the computer.
[13:45.60]I'm gonna send you on a little trial mission to see what it is.
[13:47.62]Press tab.
[13:49.78]Destroy the generator, which is up here.
[13:53.34]So I gotta go left, up, right up, right down.
[13:55.98]Okay.
[13:58.12]Gonna send you on a little trial, let's see what I do.
[13:59.70]Alright, can I do anything?
[14:00.64]Go in the bathtub?
[14:02.30]I can punch.
[14:05.82]Can I punch the computer?
[14:07.16]Yeah, but I don't want to break it.
[14:09.52]Should I break the bed?
[14:13.78]Someone is on guard duty in the building past this fence.
[14:15.71]To see more info, hold space.
[14:19.10]Hostile it looks like he won't be too happy to see you and by the way if someone's name is yellow It means they own the property.
[14:25.90]I'm teleporting you a wall bypasser try using it in your toolbar First the number key that it corresponds to its log wall bypasser What what tip Okay, typically a rep of typically a red door means people don't want you in there.
[14:42.00]Oh
[14:45.22]Door, do not enter.
[14:45.96]Okay, this is Bouncer, Hosta, Resistance Leader.
[14:49.81]Alright, so, just open the door and just, can I knock?
[14:54.18]Is there a knock on door?
[14:56.21]Meet our staff bouncer.
[14:57.23]He'll be playing the part of bad guy, but he's been instructed not to fight back under any circumstance.
[15:02.47]Hello, nice to make your acquaintance.
[15:04.11]Rookie, feel free to wail on him as hard as you can.
[15:06.09]He's a big guy, he can take it.
[15:08.03]Uh, excuse me, but I don't recall agreeing to this.
[15:10.35]When you signed your resistance paperwork, perhaps you'll recall Section 7C, which states, Members are subject to any and all of the resistance leader's illogical, dangerous, and or sadistic whims.
[15:19.94]Look, you have no right to allow some random guy off the street to take shots at me for the sake of some, what'd you call it, tutorial?
[15:26.26]We can do whatever we want to you.
[15:27.48]We're the ones in charge.
[15:29.32]You know, this is the same sort of ridiculous authoritarian crap the mayor pulls.
[15:34.11]Mayor.
[15:34.73]That's the mayor.
[15:35.53]Stop being a wimp, you'll be fine.
[15:36.57]That's the mayor.
[15:37.25]He's a double agent.
[15:38.15]We gave you that sweet hard hat, remember?
[15:40.81]Fair enough.
[15:42.75]Grab that weapon.
[15:44.28]Wait.
[15:47.42]Baseball bat?
[15:49.64]Oh, damn.
[15:51.12]Grab that tranquilizer gun and cycle to it with mouse wheel.
[15:55.77]Ah, I see, okay.
[15:59.36]How many do I have to shoot him with?
[16:00.30]Alright, I did way too many.
[16:04.24]I just over-tranquilized him.
[16:06.80]I got the key to the base.
[16:10.32]Okay, do you see that blue meter at the top of your screen?
[16:12.44]You'll get skill points for things like murdering and lockpicking.
[16:15.31]Okay.
[16:18.79]Right?
[16:19.07]Like, up here?
[16:19.65]Alright.
[16:23.95]For murdering and lo- what gets more points?
[16:28.87]Now walk through that red sensor, it's totally safe and not harmful at all.
[16:32.05]Teehee.
[16:38.87]Bahahaha, I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
[16:40.47]That never gets old.
[16:41.27]I hope you're okay.
[16:42.09]Take this bacon cheeseburger.
[16:43.53]You can quick use your health items by pressing F. Does it really- why does it have to be a bacon cheeseburger?
[16:54.47]Really?
[16:55.35]Didn't I talk shit about this like a few days ago?
[17:00.08]Okay, take the bacon cheeseburger.
[17:02.24]Quick user health by pressing F. Bacon cheeseburger.
[17:06.82]Oh, just that was so epic.
[17:08.82]Here's something you can use to deal with the lasers a little more safely.
[17:11.60]Just use it like you did the other weapons.
[17:13.94]What is it?
[17:14.50]A rock?
[17:15.08]Can you throw rocks at people?
[17:18.94]Really?
[17:20.24]Holy shit, I can throw rocks at people.
[17:21.60]Alright, this game just got way better.
[17:33.16]I have no way to open this.
[17:35.90]I'm going to give you a really cool special ability that you can use to teehee open the door.
[17:39.74]To use it, press the right mouse button.
[17:42.35]Wah!
[17:43.91]Wah!
[17:44.87]Wah!
[17:47.15]I call this the Waluigi Scream.
[17:49.45]The special ability that it gave you was Cry Profusely.
[17:51.81]I mean, that's not very useful at all, is it?
[17:53.71]Check out on your stats screen.
[17:54.81]Press R.
[18:01.22]Nobody liked the Waluigi script.
[18:02.72]I thought like... Wait, wait, hold on.
[18:04.00]Are we on the internet?
[18:05.00]Because I always thought that if you say the word Waluigi or do W-A-H-H, you automatically are way cooler of a person.
[18:12.89]Is that not cool anymore?
[18:13.75]Alright, I'm going to have to remember that.
[18:21.11]Damn.
[18:21.61]Alright.
[18:21.91]Well, I apologize about that.
[18:23.80]I thought that Waluigi was still automatically retweeted.
[18:28.54]Okay.
[18:30.04]Okay.
[18:31.08]Uh, uh, uh, uh, special ability, where is it?
[18:33.92]Cry profusely.
[18:34.82]Causes you to cry like a little baby.
[18:37.14]Serves no purpose except to embarrass you.
[18:38.97]Okay, well, I did get embarrassed.
[18:42.09]It worked.
[18:42.81]It worked, it worked as intended.
[18:44.01]Uh, here's a key.
[18:47.85]Oh, whoops, I just accidentally teleported into the elevator where you first came in.
[18:50.85]Open your mission screen with tab, then you can look at the entrance to teleport to the entrance.
[18:54.94]Oh, that's cool.
[19:01.74]Once you grab the key, you can quick teleport by pressing left control.
[19:04.73]Under normal circumstances, this will teleport you to important locations.
[19:10.63]Alright.
[19:11.93]Destroy that generator to complete your mission.
[19:13.59]You got it.
[19:18.45]Can't throw rocks at it.
[19:19.96]Unfortunately, I can't do that.
[19:22.42]How do I do it?
[19:23.26]Do I punch it?
[19:25.60]I don't think I would ever hit a space heater with a baseball bat.
[19:29.14]That's probably a bad idea.
[19:30.08]It's going to blow up.
[19:34.02]Okay.
[19:34.16]Tutorial done.
[19:36.70]Oh, you knew to get out of the way.
[19:37.80]You're no fun.
[19:39.28]Anyway, sorry for all the hazing.
[19:40.56]You're a pretty tough cookie.
[19:42.12]We only lost one person during this exercise.
[19:44.02]That's a new record.
[19:44.76]Who?
[19:46.88]Congratulations.
[19:47.50]You can join.
[19:47.94]Speak to the doctor when you get in.
[19:49.60]We'll see about getting you another bacon cheeseburger.
[19:54.50]Coming to home base.
[19:59.09]Oh, the first guy.
[19:59.85]Right, the guy that exploded.
[20:00.93]But I thought that was like a magician thing.
[20:09.48]Okay.
[20:12.70]You missed a rock.
[20:16.52]Is there like a go pee?
[20:18.22]Oh god, his free points.
[20:19.48]His free comedy points if I can do that.
[20:23.57]Nope.
[20:27.83]Get out of here!
[20:28.41]This is not the doctor?
[20:29.31]I thought this was the... Oh.
[20:31.89]Okay.
[20:34.09]I don't know why I...
[20:40.15]I was the first person I saw in a room.
[20:42.50]Look, okay.
[20:43.48]I knew that was the toilet, but this could be... I know, I'm fucking stupid.
[20:49.98]So I have a few other things to let you know before we send you out on a suicide mi- Oh.
[20:53.66]Completely achievable mission of taking down the mayor.
[20:56.83]Since you're new to the city, you should know that it's built in vertical layers, like a lasagna.
[21:01.45]I fucking hate lasagna.
[21:03.64]Slums at the bottom, then the industrial area, then the faux outdoor park downtown and uptown at the top.
[21:09.36]The only way to get from one level to the next is through the elevator.
[21:13.13]In addition to your primary mission, we'll need you to do a bunch of other stuff too.
[21:16.43]They'll be highlighted on your map, like that generator you just blew up.
[21:20.55]You'll need to finish your missions on a floor before you can travel to the next one.
[21:24.73]Resistance leaders like myself will help you out by sending you rewards for completing these missions.
[21:31.00]But that's about all we can do for you.
[21:33.37]We're less doers and more idea- I don't know, why am I doing like the person in line at Disney World to monitor that you walk by?
[21:40.59]I'm like that actor that is on the screen.
[21:42.57]I'm gonna slow down here.
[21:44.17]For example, it was my idea to send you out on this mission.
[21:47.81]So do me proud because there might be a promotion in it for me.
[21:51.78]As you may know, the mayor has banned chicken nuggets.
[21:54.68]Due to the fact that they once caused him a mild tummy ache.
[21:58.46]Wait, he banned chicken nuggets?! !
[22:03.85]Chicken nuggets have since become a rare and precious commodity.
[22:08.32]Ree.
[22:10.90]If you can scrounge up some chicken nuggets, we can trade them for things that can help you out.
[22:16.46]The doctor, the thief, and the soldier can brief you a bit more on the nugget situation.
[22:23.14]Or if you want to be heading to the city, the elevator is to your north.
[22:25.91]Good luck to you, young rogue.
[22:28.23]Oh, and by the way, stay out of the occupied restrooms.
[22:31.07]That kind of activity embarrasses the resistance more than it does you.
[22:35.99]Wow, what a callback.
[22:37.77]Alright, so I can... What's in here?
[22:39.01]A fridge?
[22:40.45]Can't open this, there's a safe in there.
[22:41.67]I'm gonna just open it.
[22:44.73]Can I steal from my own self?
[22:48.17]Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[22:49.73]If you steal from yourself, it's just yours.
[22:53.04]What about the fridge?
[22:55.42]No?
[22:55.88]Trash?
[22:58.70]It's just mine.
[23:00.00]I would be taking an item from one place and putting it in another place in my house.
[23:08.21]This is locked.
[23:11.24]Beds.
[23:11.56]I don't think I can do anything with these things.
[23:13.08]Uh-oh.
[23:18.48]Everybody good?
[23:22.73]Co-op.
[23:24.49]Oh, yeah.
[23:24.83]There's a multiplayer room.
[23:26.59]Traits.
[23:26.97]Alright, I want to learn about this.
[23:30.55]Oh, by the way, I've since activated something.
[23:34.83]So, from now on, if the stream does go to zero, if I just disconnect, there's gonna be, like, a little... the stream's not gonna turn off.
[23:41.85]There's gonna be a little, like, disconnect symbol.
[23:44.25]And I have, like, a minute or two to come back.
[23:48.65]So, I put, like, that protection on.
[23:51.35]So, we'll see if it works.
[23:54.31]Oh, bacon cheeseburgers.
[23:55.37]Oh, sorry.
[23:55.97]I ate the last one while I was performing a long surgery.
[24:01.48]I know your body better than you do.
[24:02.68]That sounded weird.
[24:03.44]Unlock traits.
[24:05.00]These traits will appear when you gain a skill level and complete the current floor.
[24:11.33]Homesickness?
[24:13.73]Followers will always follow you to the next floor.
[24:15.73]Attacks likely to do crit damage more.
[24:19.11]Lasagna ignores... That's lasers.
[24:21.25]Passed by lasers on attack.
[24:22.41]No infighting.
[24:23.41]Can't hit most people you are aligned with.
[24:25.48]And they can't hit you.
[24:26.42]Huh.
[24:32.20]There's a lot of stuff here.
[24:33.12]Do I have any money?
[24:34.62]Oh, these cost chicken nuggets.
[24:38.12]There's a lot of stuff here.
[24:39.11]So I don't have any chicken nuggets.
[24:50.74]XD.
[24:54.24]Come on.
[24:55.30]It's fine.
[24:56.18]This loadout?

[25:14.10]Reduces bullet damage.
[25:17.46]Alright.
[25:18.30]I need to get... Let me get two chicken nuggets before I do anything else.
[25:22.35]So this rewards, trades, loadout.
[25:24.17]What?

[25:48.10]Clear all mutators that you've enabled.
[25:50.64]More knockback is applied to all hits.
[25:53.15]This is just kind of making the game harder.

[64:41.14]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[64:42.17]I really don't want to hurt all of you.
[64:43.77]I don't want to hurt... Get away from me!
[64:57.66]Leave me alone!
[64:58.40]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[65:00.64]Alright, open the doors.
[65:06.32]What?
[65:06.92]Okay.
[65:14.81]No, no, no more scientists.
[65:22.64]I don't like playing the mean character.
[65:25.00]I want to play the nice character again.
[65:26.54]I don't want to be the guy that like kills people.
[65:30.55]I probably shouldn't have picked the soldier.
[65:39.03]Okay, I got plus one electability somehow.
[65:45.38]Backstabber.
[65:47.35]All map markers are filled at the beginning of levels.
[65:50.05]That's cool.
[65:51.55]Melee attacks from behind do two times damage if the victim is not in combat.
[65:55.79]Ten times if you're using camouflage.
[66:01.63]GPS?
[66:02.95]Backstab.
[66:08.95]Alright.
[66:11.45]Bouncer.
[66:15.64]What do we need?
[66:17.64]Retrieve the blueprints over here.
[66:20.11]Just get all the stuff.
[66:21.29]There's two things right here and here.
[66:24.85]MacGuffin Muffin.
[66:27.51]Is it a clone machine?
[66:28.57]Alright, let's go... Anywhere you can get in here without causing a problem?
[66:34.07]Not really.
[66:34.57]Backstab.
[66:35.07]Times two damage.
[66:35.79]Three, two, one, got him.
[66:42.84]These scientists have knives.
[66:45.95]Oh, he picked up the bat!
[67:01.34]Am I the grandma?
[67:06.74]Clone item.
[67:07.57]Oh, that's cool.
[67:08.13]Okay.
[67:14.48]Burger on the ground.
[67:15.38]Alright.
[67:20.57]I lost my helmet.
[67:21.41]That's not good.
[67:24.97]What's going on in here?
[67:25.81]Alright, gotta get in there.
[67:30.51]Let's go up.
[67:31.73]Retrieve item from the drug dealer.
[67:35.10]Watch out for the person-sized hornet that's outside your window.
[67:44.55]Why would I destroy that?
[67:51.83]Is this a deal or do I have to take it?
[67:54.40]Bribe with item.
[67:55.52]Bribe.
[67:56.06]Threat.
[67:56.54]There's a 45% chance.
[68:05.39]Okay, I got it.
[68:07.85]Ooh, I got a shotgun.
[68:13.57]Nice, alright.
[68:14.87]Now I'm a force to be reckoned with.
[68:19.81]Current run failed.
[68:21.89]Oh, shit.
[68:22.66]Alright, destroy generators.
[68:25.36]Okay, well, I'll remember that the next time.
[68:27.64]So I got the shotgun.
[68:29.74]I need to get the muffin now.
[68:39.34]These guys aren't hostile.
[68:46.28]I have to go in the shopkeeper's back room for this?
[68:49.78]How do I do this without causing a problem?
[68:52.80]Buy from shop.
[68:59.07]I can't sneak behind him.
[69:02.29]Just blow up the wall.
[69:04.57]I mean... Will that work?
[69:19.25]Stop!
[69:19.63]Run away from me!
[69:20.79]Get away from me!
[69:21.53]I'm dangerous!
[69:22.21]Alright, got the muffin.
[69:41.50]Okay, next is bottom right here.
[69:43.02]I don't want to use all this ammo.
[69:47.82]I do need a heal too.
[69:50.75]M. What's M?
[69:54.02]M?
[69:56.62]That's not on my mini-map.
[69:57.50]What is that?
[69:57.90]What's M?
[70:04.28]It's a side quest.
[70:07.43]Are you gonna attack me?
[70:12.55]Mission.
[70:14.97]Neutralize the bartender and you get five chicken nuggets for this shit.
[70:20.92]Uh, okay.
[70:23.54]Wait, didn't I already neutralize the bartender?
[70:26.02]Neutralize.
[70:31.98]I didn't promise about holding a grenade.
[70:41.41]What?
[71:10.67]That's a lot of chicken nuggets.
[71:14.96]Five chicken nuggets.
[71:18.57]I need to heal.
[71:20.03]Do I have to have a burger, right?
[71:21.11]Yeah.
[71:22.31]I'm close to leveling up, maybe I shouldn't.
[71:25.94]I'm not gonna get any trouble.
[71:27.34]What's this syringe do?
[71:30.60]I have a lot of random stuff.
[71:31.72]Kill Ammunizer.
[71:34.58]As a reward for killing three people, your guns will receive ammunition to ensure that this cycle of violence continues.
[71:43.88]Okay.
[71:44.86]Normally you'd need to be up all night to get lucky.
[71:47.62]With this, you'll have better luck all the time.
[71:50.40]Insert groan.
[71:53.22]I feel like Garfield the Monday Killer wrote half of these blurbs.
[71:59.94]Anybody else feel like that?
[72:00.76]Alright, let's go with... I'll drink a beer.
[72:10.21]Okay.
[72:11.17]That's enough.
[72:13.23]Alright, let's keep going.
[72:15.25]Now I just have to do... That's a lot of money.
[72:18.01]I'll do this.
[72:18.43]Destroy this.
[72:18.93]There's a safe down here too.
[72:26.13]What do we got?
[72:27.73]Safe.
[72:30.01]Turret.
[72:31.25]I should be alright.
[72:31.93]Don't run in front of that.
[72:32.93]Although I'm going to have to neutralize this guy.
[72:46.34]Um, I could just place a detonator.
[72:47.74]Yeah.
[72:48.84]Let's go.
[72:49.12]Can I hit him through the wall?
[73:05.61]Oh, shit!
[73:06.19]I ain't failing this.
[73:09.55]I ain't gonna fuck that up.
[73:10.61]Safe combination.
[73:11.57]Oh!
[73:16.53]32 bucks.
[73:17.39]That was worth it.
[73:23.51]Okay, I need to go down here.
[73:24.73]Nobody in... What did I just do?
[73:31.53]Poison?
[73:31.97]What do you mean?
[73:32.51]Uh-oh.
[73:37.37]How long does it last?
[73:37.99]7 seconds?
[73:38.45]That's not going to kill me, right?
[73:47.65]God damn it.
[73:48.65]Alright.
[73:49.81]I just have to destroy this and then I'm done.
[73:51.27]There's a computer over here.
[74:01.63]I need an... What in the name of God?
[74:07.06]Stupid pressure plates.
[74:08.00]I just keep picking the tiles.
[74:10.62]Alright, I'm out.
[74:15.22]56 bucks.
[74:15.82]Alright.
[74:16.58]Let's go.
[74:19.96]Full health.
[74:20.36]There it is.
[74:20.96]Finally.
[74:21.38]Alright.
[74:21.58]Give me the shotgun.
[74:22.18]Let's go up front here.
[74:25.77]Nothing else, right?
[74:26.79]This is safe.
[74:34.19]It's not worth it.
[74:35.61]No.
[74:35.71]It's not worth it.
[74:36.69]I'm going... Is it worth it?
[74:38.60]No.
[74:45.20]So what does the green and blue mean?
[74:46.48]Does that mean it's a rarer...
[74:49.72]Perk?
[74:49.92]How does that work?
[74:53.75]Health gradually regenerates when below 40.
[74:55.63]That's really good.
[74:59.15]Increase this attribute.
[75:00.09]It's just melee.
[75:01.13]Okay.
[75:01.91]Followers gain extra health.
[75:04.89]The plus means it's an upgrade.
[75:06.45]Okay.
[75:10.30]I like this one.
[75:10.82]What is it going to be?
[75:14.76]Two instead of one?
[75:20.37]Green is traits, blue is attributes or stats.
[75:22.07]Alright, that's cool.
[75:24.80]There's something in the area.
[75:26.50]Status effect.
[75:28.18]Strength 10.
[75:28.52]What?
[75:29.40]Alright, I gotta start moving.
[75:32.16]3, 2, 1.
[75:36.40]What does that mean?
[75:38.92]Always crit.
[75:39.88]Oh shit.
[75:40.50]I get it.
[75:41.14]It's gonna be... Alright, I get it, I get it.
[75:43.48]Why is this person tiny?
[75:47.52]No, no, no.
[75:47.96]Why is this person so small?
[75:51.21]What are the missions?
[75:55.25]Destroy the generator, neutralize the hacker.
[75:57.41]You got it.
[76:15.66]What?
[76:18.10]How did that not destroy the wall?
[76:19.72]Am I invisible?
[76:22.63]Oh dear, okay.
[76:24.35]Somebody just exploded, but I'm not sure why.
[76:26.51]I don't know why they exploded.
[76:29.31]I'm gonna wait till... Shoot through the window.
[76:34.06]Electro touch.
[76:35.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[76:35.48]Electro touch.
[76:35.98]Electro touch.
[76:42.10]What?
[76:43.00]Why can I not hurt him?
[76:51.59]Neutralize the little guy!
[76:52.93]Get him!
[77:00.52]This is out of control.
[77:01.58]Alright, um... One more thing to do.
[77:03.66]Just gotta do the... destroy the generator.
[77:10.98]Weak.
[77:11.60]Okay, I'm gonna wait this out.
[77:12.54]Get in here.
[77:23.17]down there.
[77:24.57]No chests or anything?
[77:30.23]I gotta go through this bullshit again.
[77:40.98]That guy always crits.
[77:41.82]I had to do that.
[77:42.48]It was just too... I'm invincible.
[77:52.10]Alright, I got an item voucher.

[79:14.05]This is a knife.
[79:15.09]Police baton.
[79:15.75]Alright.
[79:26.58]I don't want to be part of this.
[79:30.00]I'm going to just collect the items, though.
[79:35.66]Nobody dropped anything?
[79:38.67]Okay, odd, but whatever.
[79:39.95]Ammo, refill the gun.
[79:42.83]Alright, I want my shotgun reloaded.
[79:46.49]Worth it.
[79:46.81]Alright, what about this?

[82:23.86]I didn't know they exploded that violently.
[82:39.41]Alright, I got him.
[82:45.15]He's pretending to lag.

[82:53.94]I have it make it so it shuts it off.
[82:57.40]Alright, let's get the safe.
[82:59.06]Let's do this first.
[83:00.30]Is there anything quiet?
[83:03.16]Not really.
[83:10.02]There's another generator.
[83:11.00]Where?
[83:11.24]Can you turn that off so we can watch?
[83:16.10]Oh, there's Twitch integration in this game.
[83:19.91]I just have to turn it on.
[83:20.65]I don't know what it does.
[83:24.85]I want to do a few rounds where I just got familiar with the game, so maybe we can add some stuff.
[83:31.93]Alright, so the next thing I need to do is... Where's the, uh...
[83:37.61]One more generator, but should I even be doing this?
[83:39.91]Alright, there we go.
[83:43.01]Sell-o-matic.
[83:43.95]That's what I want.
[83:50.31]Chat picks the perks for you at the end of floors.
[83:52.17]Alright, that's kind of cool.

[84:22.72]I just don't know what's good.
[84:23.94]Alright, I'm going to get rid of the knife.
[84:35.54]I'm not using the landmines at all.
[84:42.00]Oh well.
[84:42.32]I don't know.
[84:46.20]Streamer actively avoids Twitch mode to ignore his viewers.
[84:52.75]Well, wouldn't that be not ignoring you guys?
[84:56.97]Isn't me turning on the Twitch mode engaging with you guys?
[85:00.24]Isn't that what that means?
[85:05.83]Alright, I need to do this.
[85:06.87]I gotta go in here and have to turn all the switches off.
[85:14.58]And when I say no, I mean the next building up.
[85:16.94]Never mind, I'm not supposed to be in here.
[85:18.31]Bye.
[85:40.66]I'm going to say I'm going to go up and then down.

[86:09.61]Out of the way.
[86:10.05]Alright, how close am I to leveling up?
[86:11.83]I don't need to heal.
[86:15.99]Couple more switches.
[86:16.75]The workers come and turn them back on.
[86:22.62]Free chicken.
[86:23.00]I gotta go back home and get some chicken nugget upgrades.
[86:28.60]I'm going this way.
[86:30.50]It'll be easier to turn that off without causing a problem.
[86:51.68]Although is there anything else I want to do?
[86:54.58]I can destroy that.
[86:56.58]Should I?
[86:56.90]Okay, I failed the total mission.
[87:01.40]Does that mean I shouldn't even do this at all?
[87:05.61]I failed everything, didn't I?
[87:09.87]So is me doing this actually do anything?
[87:14.23]Am I just wasting time right here?

[114:53.48]Hurry up.
[114:54.62]Soda machine.
[115:03.72]Oh no!
[115:04.44]You got a gun!
[115:06.66]Oh, fuck!
[115:09.36]Where's the fucking robot?
[115:11.40]No!
[115:13.06]Please!
[115:13.60]Oh, what do I do?
[115:18.98]Where's the robot?
[115:19.89]He's right here.
[115:24.03]Why?
[115:25.67]This is so stupid.
[115:28.01]I need to buy another banana.
[115:31.71]Why is he still chasing me?
[115:34.69]He just blocked that.
[115:35.67]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[115:39.95]Stupid, like, shop owner.
[115:52.82]Damn it.
[115:57.88]Alright, let's put on Twitch integration.
[115:58.98]Let's see how it is.
[116:01.37]Let me make sure I have it set up right.
[116:03.51]I have no idea what this is going to do.
[116:06.41]But it should be on.
[116:09.21]What does it do?
[116:16.44]It's on.
[116:17.42]It's apparently turned on.
[116:25.74]Let me do some traits.
[116:29.09]I'm gonna stay with the gorilla.
[116:32.73]Blaster survivor.
[116:34.59]Explosions caused by the player don't damage the player.
[116:37.03]I like that.
[116:42.34]Thieving tools may not break after usage.
[116:44.62]Cost people you hit to be knocked back further.
[116:46.72]I don't like that.
[116:50.90]Hiring people costs less.
[116:53.86]Saving crowds.
[116:54.63]The more nearby followers you have to list damage you take.
[116:58.07]Health giving items will affect your nearby followers.
[117:00.05]That's kind of good.
[117:03.65]Can't hit people of your own class unless they are hostile.
[117:07.48]That's pretty good.
[117:08.08]Alright, what about one of these two ones?
[117:11.31]Followers will always travel to the next floor.
[117:12.92]Alright, cool.
[117:17.98]It's apparently turned on.
[117:18.80]I don't know what commands you're going to have.
[117:24.36]If it even is going to work.
[117:25.90]We'll find out.
[117:30.36]Stay with the gorilla.
[117:32.34]It lets us vote on stuff, okay?
[117:35.47]Let me look at this again.
[117:36.31]I can't use projectiles.
[117:37.69]I can have three people.
[117:40.72]Knockback from damage is decreased.
[117:44.93]Kill scientists.
[117:48.17]I can do the lunge.
[117:51.71]And bananas give you more health.
[117:52.90]Alright.
[117:56.72]Turn it on?
[117:57.36]It's not working.
[117:59.68]I turned it on.
[118:01.67]Nothin'?
[118:07.95]Text at the bottom of the screen for Twitch settings.
[118:09.89]Yes.
[118:10.21]Do I maybe have to reload the game?
[118:18.34]Maybe I'll reload the game.
[118:19.30]It is on?
[118:20.65]Yeah, it's on in settings.
[118:22.01]I have the token and everything.
[118:26.37]Everything's turned on for voting.
[118:29.48]See?
[118:31.05]On, right?
[118:32.41]Vote duration, 30 seconds.
[118:33.66]Viewers choose traits, on.
[118:35.16]Viewers choose level disasters, on.
[118:37.24]Viewers choose rewards, on.
[118:41.82]It's fine, right?
[118:45.75]It leaked.
[118:47.63]Maybe it takes a minute?
[118:50.67]We'll see what happens.
[118:53.05]Alright, operate.
[118:55.80]Let's make this quick.
[119:11.19]Tell me that it hurt me.
[119:11.87]Oh, cheeseburger.
[119:17.41]Turn off all the lights in this person's house.
[119:19.19]What a mission.
[119:23.80]And then we have to rescue this office drone.
[119:30.36]Excuse me.
[119:35.56]Scientists, extra experience from the scientists, right?
[119:47.71]Alright, let's go.
[119:49.41]I can't speak English.
[119:58.63]How do I tell him to follow me?
[120:11.76]Not like that.
[120:14.03]He won't climb through the broken glass?
[120:21.19]Oh my god!
[120:25.85]We're dead.
[120:30.75]Just kill me.
[120:35.27]Just kill me, just kill me, kill me.
[120:36.59]It's not even worth it.
[120:37.09]Just kill me!
[120:37.59]Just do it, just do it, just do it.
[120:38.57]Start over.
[120:40.33]Dammit.
[120:48.78]I can't just fail the first mission.
[120:50.66]Let's go.
[120:53.28]Same deal.
[120:53.68]There is no... Okay, there's no gorilla here.
[121:03.82]Scientist?
[121:04.56]Yep.
[121:06.38]Oh, look at all these scientists in here.
[121:08.96]They're all armed, though.
[121:10.58]Not a good idea.
[121:16.93]They're in the trash.
[121:17.75]Pretty cool.
[121:20.32]What do I need to do?
[121:21.06]Up.
[121:28.86]Retreat the item in here.
[121:29.73]I can just climb through and get it and climb out.
[121:31.13]Let's do that last.
[121:36.83]I need a melee weapon with this guy.
[121:43.53]Drug dealer.
[121:44.37]Clerk.
[121:45.03]Annoyed.
[121:45.65]Yeah, clerks don't like it when I come in here.
[121:46.98]I'll fucking deal with it.
[122:07.08]I can't shoot a gun, but I can use a computer.
[122:08.86]How does that make any sense?
[122:16.78]Come here.
[122:26.06]Come here.
[122:26.40]No, no, don't let him run away.
[122:27.44]Don't.
[122:27.80]Alright.
[122:28.04]Well, I don't care.
[122:28.60]You got away.
[122:33.56]Gorillas can use computers.
[122:34.89]Are you stupid?
[122:38.13]You wouldn't have got a friend.
[122:40.73]Give me this.
[122:45.77]Gorilla's hard.
[122:46.63]Okay.
[122:51.46]I gotta get over here.
[122:52.78]Got the baseball.
[123:01.04]Rewards?
[123:01.52]Choose a reward for your friendly streamer.
[123:04.75]What?
[123:05.25]Oh, it's working!
[123:06.17]It's working!
[123:06.65]It's working!
[123:07.17]It works.
[123:10.53]How do you do this?
[123:11.83]Do I get to vote too?
[123:12.57]Give me the sword.
[123:21.04]Don't give me the grenade.
[123:21.74]I can't use the grenade.
[123:29.16]Sword?
[123:29.60]Yeah.
[123:31.64]Mm-hmm.
[123:34.03]That's pretty good.
[123:34.73]Thanks, guys.
[123:36.63]Thanks for looking out for me.
[123:47.35]23 bucks.
[123:48.99]I gotta go up.
[123:57.91]Just get me out of here.
[124:00.71]Nothing else, right?
[124:01.27]Nope.
[124:02.63]ATM.
[124:03.52]Can I break the ATM?
[124:06.82]Will I get money from the ATM?
[124:08.46]No.
[124:12.54]Yeah, you're in.
[124:13.10]You're in?
[124:13.46]Yeah.
[124:15.66]My fate is in your hands.
[124:17.64]So please, be nice to me.
[124:23.70]Shit.
[124:24.12]I'm not doing that.
[124:25.12]Why would I do that?
[124:25.68]Wait, do I have to do that?
[124:27.90]Get the briefcase from the chest.
[124:41.03]Oh shit.
[124:42.59]Up is down and down is up.
[124:46.83]No!
[124:47.81]I can't... I can't control this.
[124:50.59]I have to hold up to go down.
[124:52.71]How long does it... You have no idea how fucking hard that was to do.
[125:09.56]It's still... When does it stop?
[125:14.42]Oh my god.
[125:15.00]Thank goodness.
[125:22.41]Even swinging in this direction, swung it over in that direction.
[125:25.23]That was horrible.
[125:27.43]Okay.
[125:29.29]I got everything I need.
[125:31.82]Let's move.
[125:32.86]I'm not doing the generator.
[125:33.84]No reason to.
[125:34.52]Just go.
[125:46.97]Choose a trait.
[125:47.43]Okay, I'll let you see what they do.
[125:52.98]Enies are more likely to run away, followers gain extra health, and receive money at the start of every new floor.
[126:00.70]Why did I know everyone was going to pick this one?
[126:05.89]Oh, it didn't mark her.
[126:06.55]Yeah, she's ugly.
[126:16.68]Alright, so people run away.
[126:25.02]One person said that.
[126:26.28]One guy said that and you're still holding on to it.
[126:29.47]Alright, kill doctor, get lockpick.
[126:33.05]Get the hard drive from the gangster and turn off all the switches.
[126:37.83]Okay.
[126:42.43]What do I got here?
[126:43.73]Banana peel.
[126:45.07]Oh, that's cool.
[126:48.08]Food.
[126:49.54]Sell that.
[126:50.07]Put the rock on here.
[126:53.07]Alright, so I can make people... Send your opponents on a trip to the ground?
[126:58.37]How does this work?
[127:01.91]Oh, that's what the other gorilla was using.
[127:04.48]Right.
[127:08.90]I'm gonna buy a banana.
[127:13.18]And... Should I clone myself?
[127:14.84]I don't have any money.
[127:15.62]Never mind.
[127:19.33]There's a mission up there too.
[127:21.21]No gorillas to free.
[127:22.07]Let's go do it.
[127:27.87]What do you got?
[127:30.44]Free the slave.
[127:31.44]Get five nuggets.
[127:32.78]Okay, it's down at the bottom.
[127:44.49]Down here.
[127:52.46]It's down this way.
[127:56.18]What are you doing?
[127:56.88]Why are you freaking out?
[127:59.98]Why are you freaking out?
[128:01.18]What's going on here?
[128:12.01]What is this?
[128:14.91]What the fuck is this?
[128:28.04]What?
[128:31.33]Why did somebody make this?
[128:36.31]That's fucking terrifying.
[128:38.47]I told you.
[128:39.79]I told you guys.
[128:40.69]I told you this like a year ago.
[128:42.91]Eventually, you're gonna be- They're gonna get- You can say anything.
[128:45.43]They'll get you to say anything.
[128:46.83]They'll get your face on shit.
[128:49.13]There's not gonna be- There's no such thing as authenticity anymore.
[128:52.25]In another five years, this technology will be perfected.
[128:56.11]How did you do this?
[129:01.88]I'm gonna show this.
[129:03.93]Because this is absolutely outrageous.
[129:06.29]That's me on the screen.
[129:07.25]Like, I was in this scene.
[129:08.83]Had to have been.
[129:17.49]Hold on.
[129:17.69]Why is this so small?
[129:37.94]I hate this.
[129:39.14]Computers are just... I see it in fucking like a hundred years.
[130:04.77]when like we will we're not going to be under control by the machines someone will come up with some algorithm that replaces human brains and we're just it's over I don't know how you make something like that yeah and that's like the third or fourth time that's happened
[130:32.92]Some of you guys are getting really good at this.
[130:34.28]Like, do you eat ass?
[130:35.44]Like, yes, of course I do.
[130:36.74]I've seen that before.
[130:37.52]Some of you guys are getting really good at this.
[130:40.12]There's one of me dabbing.
[130:42.66]Also, another great thing about the... Oh, your face can be put on anything.
[130:47.34]I could just deny anything, ever.
[130:51.19]Like, I've never done that.
[130:53.15]I can deny it, because look, did you see how good fakes are?
[130:55.89]It's easy to deny everything now.
[131:01.57]Okay, I gotta... How do I get you out of here?
[131:03.15]Do I have to kill the guards?
[131:12.23]Hey, you can't... That was like a joke.
[131:14.08]That was the... Come on.
[131:17.56]You're gonna stab me over a joke?
[131:29.25]Alright, I'll take the axe for sure.
[131:30.41]Alright, did you get out?
[131:33.73]Did you get out?
[131:34.83]I didn't kill the guy accidentally, right?
[131:38.01]No, I'm good.
[131:42.59]An 87?
[131:43.03]Wait, where's this?
[131:49.68]Oh, he's up here.
[131:52.32]Out of the way.
[131:52.86]I will take the chicken nuggets, thank you.
[132:00.68]Huey Lewis.
[132:01.46]Alright, so I should be able to retrieve the item and just break through the door.
[132:04.40]No?
[132:06.98]This shouldn't be too hard, though.
[132:12.31]Why don't you break through that?
[132:21.30]Oh, shit.
[132:21.68]You have to pick every reward I get.
[132:24.70]Free item, mini fridge, which makes food better.
[132:28.30]Shuriken.
[132:29.28]People generally dislike when you plant these in their faces, or has literally nothing to do with small rodents, but does increase your chance of scoring a crit by 100%.
[132:36.49]Why would somebody deep fake me onto that?
[132:45.83]I still can't get over that.
[132:49.83]Can you deepfake me onto Willy Wonka when he does the Pure Imagination song?
[132:56.09]Somebody get on that.
[133:02.28]How long would that take?
[133:02.92]Would that take, like, two quantum computers to get that done in, like, the next couple hours?
[133:09.70]I'm not talking the whole scene.
[133:21.52]Alright, we gotta go... I want that chest.
[133:28.82]Easy.
[133:30.04]And a burger drop, good.
[133:31.34]What's in the chest?
[133:31.82]Something to sell.
[133:34.86]Good.
[133:35.90]No gorillas, right?
[133:36.64]Nope.
[133:41.37]Really good and well-trained deepfakes can render an entire scene in about two days.
[133:50.63]That's not worth it.
[133:52.03]That's not worth it.
[133:56.42]Upgrade trait.
[133:58.04]Ooh.
[133:58.84]That's way too much money.
[134:03.68]That's some.
[134:06.59]Oh my god.
[134:08.79]Neutralize the doctor.
[134:09.79]Of course, let's turn off these switches.
[134:12.23]Get out of here.
[134:12.89]Oh, okay.
[134:13.33]I'm getting out.
[134:13.77]I'm leaving.
[134:24.91]key to the bank watch the full deep fake what hold on what do you mean the full deep fake somebody did the whole scene no they didn't why what
[134:59.78]My god, you gotta be kidding me What Wait, let me see this This
[135:32.65]Why?
[135:34.29]Why did you make this?
[135:37.81]I don't have any reason for anybody to have made this.
[135:44.02]We have to watch this.
[135:50.38]I'm putting it on screen.
[135:53.62]Alright, so spoilers for American Psycho.
[135:57.35]If you've never seen that movie before.
[136:00.05]And just know that if you haven't seen it, this is a scene in that movie.
[136:03.93]Okay?
[136:04.81]Good.
[136:05.21]Are we good?
[136:06.01]I think we're good.
[136:06.93]You understand?
[136:15.88]You like Huey Lewis in the news?
[136:18.96]They're okay.
[136:21.77]That's not me?
[136:22.63]That's not- is that me?
[136:24.22]That's not me?
[136:24.82]I can't tell.
[136:26.00]I can't tell.
[136:53.29]He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
[137:00.14]Hey, Albus.
[137:01.36]Yes, Alan?
[137:02.34]Why are there copies of the style section on the plate?
[137:05.00]Do you have a dog?
[137:06.80]A little chow or something?
[137:10.47]No, Alan.
[137:11.47]Is that a raincoat?
[137:12.97]Yes, it is.
[137:13.69]In 87.
[137:32.09]This is- why is it so loud?
[137:33.73]I don't even care It's hip to fuck people
[138:03.07]What?
[138:03.79]What is he saying?
[138:06.18]What is he saying?
[138:11.30]What is it saying?
[138:12.04]Is it to fuck you?
[138:13.28]Okay, I looked over and somebody said...
[138:25.31]Major TOS warning.
[138:27.26]And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[138:28.90]Oh, right, when he brutally murders this guy with a fucking axe on camera.
[138:33.30]Oh, right, yeah.
[138:34.99]That part.
[138:35.83]I forgot about that.
[138:36.73]Okay.
[138:53.91]It's not real?
[138:55.52]Yeah, I... It's cool if it's a video game, not if it's a movie.
[139:01.36]I don't make the rules!
[139:07.08]Hold on, let me see this.
[139:11.20]Where did it go?
[139:18.61]What is this?
[139:30.20]This is so fucked up.
[139:35.25]This is ridiculous.
[139:51.60]I couldn't tell if it was Christian Bale or my face.
[139:54.04]It was too weird.
[140:05.03]We're going to down paths that we never should have gone down.
[140:12.24]Let me tell you a story, okay?
[140:14.76]I'll tell you a story.
[140:18.70]I'm going to put this on screen and I'm going to tell you a little story.
[140:25.39]Give me one second.
[140:36.93]Because it needs to be said.
[140:44.31]Okay, so... What was supposed to be... What was supposed to be... Like 50k on a computer... Has turned into... People doing this shit for fun.
[141:03.00]You were only supposed to send an email to somebody once a day.
[141:10.39]You understand?
[141:13.65]Once a day you were supposed to send an email, or maybe receive the equivalent of a fucking text from your mother.
[141:26.96]You know what I'm saying?
[141:30.70]Not much of a story, but more of an observation.
[141:36.58]That's like my hair.
[141:47.05]Alright.
[141:47.89]Wait a second.
[141:48.80]Freeze that.
[141:58.06]We have to do this.
[141:58.90]Because I need to see if this is for real.
[142:07.84]Hold on.
[142:13.45]Can I pause this without...
[142:23.18]Move this out of the way.
[142:30.40]Fuck, it is.
[142:39.61]Why is it exactly the same?
[142:41.69]It's just a little, like, it's a little cleaner.
[142:49.11]Hold on, I can flip it.
[142:50.41]Wait.
[142:54.51]Let me flip this.
[143:30.93]I can't, I, this is too weird for me.
[143:45.11]Don't look at that!
[143:49.29]Alright, I've had enough.
[144:06.91]It's hard to even process that that's even possible.
[144:11.88]Remember when GPS was a big deal?
[144:14.38]When you had the thing that told you directions?
[144:18.03]Wow, it's just technology.
[144:20.03]It tells you how to get to the person's house.
[144:22.93]I'm going to pretend that you were in this movie killing somebody now.
[144:26.80]What happens next?
[144:42.70]Skynet.
[144:46.38]Well, that was a good little intermission there, I think.
[144:49.18]Let's get back to the game.
[144:52.14]Facecam so we have more footage to use.
[144:56.35]No, I don't do facecam.
[144:57.95]I only do facecam like once a month.
[145:09.61]No, I was in front of a green screen for like six hours.
[145:12.97]You can't pull some of that?
[145:14.17]Let me just be the gorilla, hold on.
[145:25.91]I gotta get in there.
[145:28.77]I'm never gonna turn my facecam on again.
[145:31.65]Someone will use it.
[145:33.94]Someone will use it somewhere without my permission.
[145:40.54]That was it.
[145:40.98]That's all that was in there.
[145:48.36]Turret.
[145:49.16]Turret.
[145:49.58]What do I do about that?
[145:50.26]I had to go the other way.
[146:02.39]See you later, goon.
[146:11.52]$61.
[146:11.56]Pretty good.
[146:14.36]The turret only shoots if the camera sees you.
[146:15.98]That's good to know.
[146:17.88]Let me at least get to level 5.
[146:18.72]Am I ever going to be able to do this?
[146:25.40]Syringe in a trash can.
[146:26.52]I wouldn't pick that up if I were you.
[146:33.95]Is that right?
[146:39.49]This is going to be hard to do.
[146:42.40]I'm gonna have to break a door.
[146:44.16]Climb through a window or... Because nobody wants the gorilla in the store, right?
[146:49.80]Maybe if I can just go right through.
[146:50.80]Wait, is the cop gonna see that?
[146:58.33]Sometimes you gotta just go for it.
[146:59.63]You just do.
[146:59.93]Let's go.
[147:11.18]New floor.
[147:12.92]Here we go.
[147:15.06]Give me something good, guys, please.
[147:16.66]Please.
[147:19.35]Followers will always follow you to the next floor.
[147:21.97]Melee weapons can destroy walls.
[147:24.41]Or items in shop cost less.
[147:26.49]But I can't talk.
[147:29.01]So that's not gonna help me.
[147:31.63]Choose wisely.
[147:39.91]3 is 100% useless, right.
[147:41.13]What was that?
[147:48.89]Oh.
[147:51.25]Like a 2?
[147:52.85]Hey, wait, wait, wait!
[147:53.51]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow down, slow down.
[147:55.49]Which terrifying disaster should befall your poor streamer in the next level?
[147:59.30]Bombs are falling from the sky, a bounty is on the player's head so random people will attack, or a killer robot.
[148:04.86]No, don't do the killer robot!
[148:06.06]That's guaranteed it runs over.
[148:09.50]Do, like, bombs dropping.
[148:10.74]That's, like, funny LLL moment, right?
[148:12.20]Come on.
[148:19.05]Really?
[148:20.27]This one sucks.
[148:23.97]This one actually sucks.
[148:25.44]I'm probably gonna lose.
[148:26.38]I'm just gonna go to the end of the level as fast as I can.
[148:29.04]Any gorillas on here?
[148:30.12]There are two gorillas.
[148:31.02]Great.
[148:31.66]I need to... I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[148:33.86]I gotta go fast.
[148:34.40]Hurry.
[148:35.28]Hurry.
[148:37.99]I didn't mean to punch that person.
[148:42.30]Alright.
[148:43.92]Free everybody, right?
[148:45.46]Computer.
[148:45.82]Give me the rock.
[148:52.36]Open everything.
[148:54.54]Done.
[148:55.02]Go.
[148:55.70]Get out.
[148:55.92]Everybody out.
[148:56.96]Gorilla?
[148:58.45]Where is this gorilla?
[148:59.15]There's a safe in here, though.
[149:02.23]Holy shit.
[149:03.05]That was a slaughter.
[149:12.98]Get out of the way.
[149:13.62]Alright.
[149:14.26]Safe.
[149:19.74]Alright, here he comes.
[149:20.39]Here he comes.
[149:21.21]This way.
[149:32.41]I want the food in here.
[149:33.07]Alright, I'm good.
[149:40.06]Is this red team versus blue team?
[149:41.90]Red team doesn't even know it's on defense.
[149:45.90]Oh, hell yeah.
[149:46.50]I'm just gonna sit here.
[149:49.07]Items?
[149:52.41]Oh, shit!
[149:53.13]What have I done?
[149:53.57]Oops.
[150:01.69]Alright.
[150:02.12]I can...
[150:11.23]What is in here?
[150:11.73]There's a... Use a lockpick.
[150:15.33]Gorilla lockpicking.
[150:16.35]Okay, it worked.
[150:18.05]Give me that.
[150:19.83]Uh, where is he?
[150:20.27]He's across the way.
[150:22.39]Arcade machine.
[150:27.61]Okay, I'm gonna have him blow up this wall and I'm gonna pick the item up.
[150:35.72]Oh, shit.
[150:36.90]Oh, shit.
[150:37.34]I'm in trouble.
[150:37.96]This is bad.
[150:48.13]Shoot it!
[150:53.05]Oh my god, I'm just trying to- No, please!
[151:11.20]I don't have a way to open the safe.
[151:12.70]I can't use a computer either.
[151:13.81]How am I supposed to open this?
[151:16.05]Wait, can I not open... I hate this fucking robot, man.
[151:18.95]This robot sucks.
[151:22.15]No, I just punched a cop in the face.
[151:23.87]Alright, how do I use the... Where's the computer?
[151:38.59]I thought I couldn't use the computer.
[151:39.63]Alright, I might be alright.
[151:42.17]Where is he?
[151:46.49]Out.
[151:47.79]Mystery reward.
[151:50.09]Floor clear.
[151:50.57]Elevator open.
[151:51.73]Alright, something good.
[151:53.88]Before you stick that syringe in your arm, perhaps you should know what it does.
[151:57.22]Carbo box.
[151:57.76]As long as you're hiding under this, no one will notice you unless you move around.
[152:00.76]Okay.
[152:01.66]Floor block.
[152:03.90]Where's the robot?
[152:13.49]work on the robot?
[152:19.49]If I go into this immediately, will that help?
[152:28.12]Where are the... Okay, gorillas.
[152:31.60]The gorillas... There's a beer over here.
[152:33.50]Okay, I gotta drink that beer.
[152:34.74]Can gorillas drink beer?
[152:44.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[152:45.46]Keep going this way.
[152:47.06]I need to get that beer.
[153:00.40]Ten health.
[153:01.04]That's it.
[153:02.68]Um... Okay, I gotta get... Oh, fuck.
[153:07.04]No!
[153:08.02]I hate that stupid robot!
[153:11.04]Alright, I'm not doing the gorilla anymore.
[153:12.70]It's too hard.
[153:17.35]I'm doing... Receive XP for object and wall destroyed.
[153:26.31]Alright, can't use computers or other tech.
[153:29.46]A very loud... I can break everything.
[153:32.20]I'm gonna try it.
[153:32.74]Alright, this time I'm going for it.
[153:45.54]What's the mission?
[153:47.61]Destroy air filtration system.
[153:50.19]Okay.
[153:50.93]Destroy every object of a certain- I gotta destroy all the air filters.
[153:55.32]Neutralize, sure.
[153:58.62]Can I destroy walls?
[154:12.42]And he bounced around.
[154:14.12]No!
[154:14.70]This character sucks too!
[154:16.46]All these characters suck!
[154:20.40]Alright, I got... This sucks.
[154:31.24]Oh, a gorilla!
[154:36.78]No, I'm sorry.
[154:37.22]You have to stay there.
[154:46.52]He's gonna blame the game.
[154:47.84]Thief, get away.
[154:49.16]I need to destroy the air filters.
[154:52.63]How do I only have 27 health?
[154:54.83]What happened?
[155:17.94]That's all I have?
[155:18.36]Uh, I'm just gonna stick this in me, I think.
[155:22.09]Yeah, I'm just gonna stick it in.
[155:26.25]Oh, that's good.
[155:29.23]What a great, uh, what a great thing to get.
[155:31.39]Okay.
[155:37.77]Anything down here?
[155:38.95]No.
[155:46.17]There's one filtration system.
[155:49.13]I may have missed one down below, but whatever.
[155:50.95]I don't want a mystery item.
[155:57.45]I do have to go retrieve the item from this guy.
[156:00.99]Break things to get experience?
[156:02.91]I know, but I'm not gonna alert people.
[156:07.06]See, I just pulled everybody over here.
[156:09.00]I'm gonna die.
[156:18.90]See?
[156:19.18]I'm dead.
[156:19.54]I'm dead.
[156:22.02]Holy shit.
[156:26.97]Please don't kill me.
[156:27.57]Please don't kill me.
[156:28.11]I'm dead.
[156:28.59]Oh my god.
[156:29.19]Alright.
[156:29.47]I'm up.
[156:29.79]No.
[156:30.15]No.
[156:30.47]No.
[156:30.75]I'm being like a regular character.
[156:37.99]I'm a gangster.
[156:39.91]Or hacker.
[156:44.39]Hacker.
[156:45.95]Remotely hack any computer.
[156:49.46]Let me try the gangster.
[156:52.22]Bloods will attack on sight.
[156:53.72]Extra XP for killing bloods.
[156:55.26]That's red, right?
[156:57.44]Recruit up to three followers.
[157:01.98]Okay.
[157:03.28]Wipe out every last blood you come across and ensure permanent Kray dominance.
[157:07.78]Alright, I guess let's try it.
[157:15.78]There are five that are here, so I need to... How do I recruit people?
[157:19.27]Alright, we need to... Alright, double kill.
[157:30.86]Good.
[157:35.82]Just talk to the blue guys?
[157:36.88]Okay.
[157:37.20]Okay.
[157:42.39]Bribe with item.
[157:43.23]Threaten.
[157:49.67]Okay, I'll take the combination.
[157:55.39]I'm gonna use the key and we'll use the combination.
[157:58.87]39 bucks.
[157:59.33]Not bad so far.
[158:00.01]Okay, this is not bad.
[158:00.77]Not terrible.
[158:01.21]Are these blue guys?
[158:03.78]Do these count?
[158:07.54]How do you guys get out of here?
[158:14.98]Buy from shop.
[158:16.78]No, it's drugs.
[158:20.92]No.
[158:22.86]I gotta get through here.
[158:28.16]Any more of those red guys?
[158:29.76]Oh, oh, oh!
[158:37.51]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!
[158:39.87]Oh, you killed him.
[158:40.45]Uh-oh.
[158:41.73]Um...
[158:52.57]I hit every single attack.
[158:54.17]Every single one.
[158:55.11]That's gotta say something.
[159:02.98]I'm not sure what that's supposed to say.
[159:05.06]But... Not very much, I guess.
[159:09.74]The game has auto-aim.
[159:11.38]Man, I knew someone was gonna take it from me.
[159:14.92]Somebody was gonna take it from me.
[159:16.06]I knew they were.
[159:24.20]No pressure plates, good.
[159:26.52]What happened to this guy?
[159:31.65]Oh, burnt.
[159:32.21]10, not... Why is there a timer?
[159:39.73]Do they all turn back on?
[159:43.35]Wait.
[159:43.51]3, 2, 1... What?
[159:55.72]I... It's alright.
[159:59.42]It's not the main mission.
[160:00.42]It's fine.
[160:01.74]What?
[160:05.06]I... I didn't know that.
[160:06.00]Alright.
[160:10.14]I thought that it was going to turn them all back on again.
[160:21.91]I do have the cell phone, which recruits people, right?
[160:29.55]Uh, doing bar fails more quickly, easier to knock people through walls, and you can't hit people you are aligned with.
[160:36.21]I think that's a really good one.
[160:37.53]If I were in the chat right now, I would be pressing 3.
[160:39.45]That's if I was in the chat.
[160:45.20]If I was streaming the game, I wouldn't have to say it because, uh, you're in the chair.
[160:51.16]Not me.
[160:54.62]Yeah, I mean, come on.
[160:55.24]That's perfect.
[160:55.76]That is everything we're looking for.
[161:01.25]Nice.
[161:07.67]Alright, so now... Let's go... There are three red team members here.
[161:15.56]Destroy everything.
[161:16.12]Neutralize.
[161:16.76]Alright.
[161:20.20]There's a red team member right there.
[161:22.14]Do you have a gun or a knife?
[161:34.21]I don't know how I hit you through the wall.
[161:35.99]I really don't understand that.
[161:36.83]Alright.
[161:37.97]Two more.
[161:38.37]Let's destroy that.
[161:45.75]Mission in here.
[161:51.30]Let's just check it out.
[161:56.94]Retrieve the muffin from the bartender.
[161:59.60]Sure thing.
[162:00.08]And I'm gonna recruit you.
[162:02.86]Join me.
[162:03.58]Both of you.
[162:06.80]That's what I'm talking about.
[162:07.44]So we're going to get the muffin from the bartender.
[162:11.72]Should be easy with three of us.
[162:16.32]Let's go this way.
[162:23.52]I did kind of just go the long way, but it's alright.
[162:27.11]Hello.
[162:29.81]Threatened.
[162:30.81]65% chance.
[162:31.63]Take it.
[162:31.97]Don't hurt me.
[162:33.19]Worked.
[162:34.99]Did it work?
[162:39.06]Do I have it?
[162:39.98]Okay, I got it.
[162:40.42]Uh, there's a chest in here, though.
[162:45.28]Should I get it?
[162:53.44]No.
[162:54.40]Not worth it.
[162:58.47]Let's turn this in.
[163:00.71]How many chicken nugget points do I have now?
[163:02.37]Probably a lot.
[163:04.41]At least like 30 or 40, right?
[163:06.25]After this.
[163:15.70]Jerma, buy beer.
[163:19.64]Uh... How do I destroy it?
[163:21.52]I'm going to do that last.
[163:22.26]That's going to cause the most chaos.
[163:34.91]This is probably timed again.
[163:45.42]Do not enter.
[163:47.93]Uh, this is also a do not enter, but... I mean, at some point... Alright, cause all attack.
[163:54.75]Go.

[174:29.69]Two, one.
[174:30.77]Let's teleport to the front and then go down from here because I'm still missing one person.
[174:40.71]Where are you?

[175:29.76]All of these are good except for this one.
[175:31.96]But I know everyone's going to pick that because you have to.
[175:36.28]These two are very good for what's going on right now.
[175:39.17]But can it beat out the meme response, I wonder.
[175:47.67]Followers gain extra health and I don't get hurt by my own explosions.

[176:55.21]Freeze Ray.
[176:57.51]Try talking to him.
[176:59.61]Yeah, you're right.
[177:00.21]I haven't been using very much diplomacy.
[177:02.71]At all.
[177:03.03]Freeze ray.
[177:09.46]Alright, I'm gonna... Everyone stay here.
[177:11.96]Come here.
[177:13.10]I'll stand guard.
[177:14.04]There.
[177:19.95]Who heard that?
[177:25.95]No, no, no.
[177:26.43]Go... 15 HP?
[177:28.15]That's not worth it.
[177:28.81]Everybody follow me.
[177:41.21]Okay.
[177:41.35]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[177:46.79]Alright.
[177:56.37]Everybody stay here.
[177:58.17]Do not move.
[177:59.11]All stand guard.
[177:59.87]Go in the corner.
[178:00.59]Nobody move.
[178:02.53]I can handle this.
[178:03.75]You're just gonna get yourselves killed.
[178:07.85]Alright.
[178:09.45]What do I wanna do?
[178:09.97]Down here.
[178:12.14]Destroy this.
[178:14.18]Use key.
[178:14.82]Come on.
[178:15.26]I don't mind.
[178:26.25]Is it good?
[178:26.97]Alright.
[178:32.95]I can get this.
[178:33.56]Is this going to make a lot of noise?
[178:44.64]Fight back, fight back, fight back!
[178:47.44]Fight back!
[178:48.24]What are you doing?
[178:50.20]Holy shit, you guys are pathetic.
[178:52.82]Unbelievable.
[178:56.94]We only just- you say stay, we don't do anything.
[179:00.14]Okay.
[179:01.80]Four dolls.
[179:02.24]I'm never opening another chest ever again.
[179:06.56]That was less than the other one.
[179:17.48]Retrieve that.
[179:18.20]I should be able to go... Oh, that's... What is that?
[179:22.38]Hacker?
[179:24.64]Hack into any computer.
[179:25.54]Ooh.
[179:28.58]Pretty nice.
[179:28.98]Okay, you... I'm gonna... Let's do some distraction here.
[179:37.25]Ooh, hold on.
[179:37.73]Alright, you... Attack the security camera.
[179:48.31]Oh, you can't.
[179:48.79]I can't have you just attack the security camera?
[179:52.29]That's kind of annoying.
[179:55.98]He didn't even say let's go back here.
[179:57.52]Alright.
[180:00.30]No way to open the door.
[180:01.20]I have to blow it up.
[180:06.66]I can't even blow this up.
[180:31.73]I tried diplomacy.
[180:32.71]It didn't work.
[180:41.47]Got it.
[180:47.64]Hard hat, shotgun, ammo stealer, or critter upper.
[180:50.16]Give me the shotgun.
[180:51.16]You know what to do.
[181:07.99]What if it's a tie?
[181:08.73]Uh, it probably does it again.
[181:12.19]With the two that are highest, maybe?
[181:14.91]Or... I don't know.
[181:16.43]Alright, got the shotgun.
[181:20.69]Where are the two red people?
[181:30.70]I'm gonna say up.
[181:43.36]I have to go back and upgrade some traits too.
[181:49.25]Mission up here.
[181:52.61]What do you got?
[181:54.87]Neutralize some folks.
[181:56.81]Are they red?
[182:00.78]No.
[182:10.92]Uh, I'm gonna have them do the dirty work here.
[182:12.84]I don't want to take any damage.
[182:15.90]All of you get in there.
[182:16.56]Nice job.
[182:29.18]Hey!
[182:39.77]Okay.
[182:44.03]You come with me?
[182:52.54]Where are the red?
[182:59.74]Everything is $5, always.
[183:02.90]Always $5, no matter what.
[183:04.87]And I'm still missing these two.
[183:20.08]Did anybody see them?
[183:20.88]I didn't see them anywhere.
[183:21.66]Where the hell are these people?
[183:36.87]Down here?
[183:51.07]Where are the two red team members?
[183:53.24]Did I just walk by them at some point?
[184:09.67]Why is this guy not following me?
[184:23.20]They don't show up on the mini-map, do they?
[184:27.68]Shit, I'm gonna pee my pants, aren't I?
[184:33.03]Oh, here they are.
[184:33.53]Alright, let's go in.
[184:36.69]Go with the guy with the gun first.
[184:55.82]Got him.
[184:56.18]Alright.
[184:58.54]No, don't point the gun.
[185:01.42]Whiskey.
[185:02.80]Syringe.
[185:03.26]A lot of random items.
[185:04.00]Cool.
[185:06.07]I can't pick up any more money.
[185:09.45]They show up on the minimap if you already found them.
[185:10.89]Alright, we're good.
[185:12.15]Time to go.
[185:22.06]Melee plus one.
[185:24.74]I'll take any of these.
[185:25.34]Except I'm not really buying stuff from the store.
[185:28.64]I don't know.
[185:29.70]I'm not really doing that.
[185:38.87]Backstabber.
[185:39.91]Okay.
[185:55.77]Oh, no.
[185:57.96]Which terrifying disaster should befall your streamer?
[186:01.30]Ooze is spreading, trying not to touch it.
[186:03.72]Zombies are on the level, and a bounty is on the player's head.
[186:10.72]I don't know what... We haven't seen any of these.
[186:12.24]It's always just, here comes the robots, huh?
[186:13.99]Apparently it's going to be zombies.
[186:19.85]I'm opening up the cell phone, and I'm calling some friends the second this loads up.
[186:25.98]I'm using one of my phone friends here.
[186:27.60]I ain't gonna die down here.
[186:35.22]The dead are restless.
[186:36.12]It's zombie time.
[186:40.99]I'm making a phone call.
[186:43.53]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[186:44.27]I'm not doing this shit.
[186:45.81]Alright, let's give you some items.
[186:48.82]Take a knife.
[186:52.32]And then you take... No, the shotgun's mine.
[186:58.89]You take the pistol.
[186:59.59]Still have the freeze gun.
[187:01.81]Alright, let's go.
[187:03.83]There's one red person.
[187:05.57]And it's the person we have to kill.
[187:06.60]So they're right here.
[187:07.32]And then they get the item from the worker.
[187:08.86]Let's go.
[187:21.70]Alright, that's not horrible.
[187:25.58]I can deal with that.
[187:26.14]It's only like one at a time.
[187:32.41]Never mind.
[187:35.61]Okay, let's just go in.
[187:37.97]We're gonna just go get the item.
[187:43.65]I don't just get it.
[187:48.46]What happened?
[187:51.28]What's going on?
[187:51.84]Okay.
[187:55.34]Lockpick item voucher silencer or ghost giver.
[188:06.58]Jesus.
[188:07.06]I only have one bullet left.
[188:14.78]So this kills ghosts.
[188:18.15]I haven't seen very many ghosts.
[188:20.96]I would love... Alright, what do I do?
[188:27.98]Frozen.
[188:31.16]Not cool.
[188:33.90]Do I still have any people left?
[188:41.29]17.
[188:43.89]That's done.
[188:44.85]Completed.
[188:45.41]Slums.
[188:46.47]I gotta get the tooth from... Okay.
[188:49.61]Okay.
[188:52.59]Zombies all dead?
[188:53.13]I think so.
[188:56.52]What are you doing?
[188:57.12]Oh, wait.
[188:57.62]No, no, no, no.
[188:58.10]They're turning into zombies.
[188:59.04]This is bad.
[188:59.82]Very bad.
[189:01.20]Oh, shit.
[189:06.26]Oh, god.
[189:06.74]This is horrible.
[189:08.14]Somebody help me.
[189:11.84]Are they ghosts?
[189:13.26]Wait, they are ghosts!
[189:21.62]They're technically ghosts.
[189:43.94]No, stop fucking hurting me.
[189:45.54]Why would you fight me?
[189:47.16]It makes no sense.
[189:52.44]Sucks.
[189:54.70]Do I have any... Okay, this guy, I have to freeze him.
[190:12.67]No, just shoot.
[190:13.39]Alright, got it.
[190:24.77]mini fridge elevator open out got it alright I'm safe I'm fine everything's good that was a little chaotic but it's mine I am going to keep the axe out in the event that I just destroyed that guy and now he turned into a zombie which makes it even worse alright he's dead
[191:00.64]This thing is too good.
[191:01.36]I'm not going to use it.
[191:05.71]I mean... Just get me the hell out of here.
[191:15.91]This syringe... I'm going to take one of these.
[191:18.38]What's this one do?
[191:21.40]What's it doing?
[191:22.18]Damage resist?
[191:25.58]Look at all the items everywhere.
[191:29.43]I need one of those cell machine things.
[191:46.30]No, just go.
[191:46.82]Just go.
[191:48.88]Everything's done.
[191:53.87]Take out the ghost gun.
[191:55.95]Just in case I run into anything in the meantime.
[192:00.53]Yep.
[192:07.69]Well.
[192:18.22]No, why do you have to turn?
[192:19.80]Okay, I'm going with the bat.
[192:32.95]Are these going to keep coming back to life?
[192:37.59]Done.
[192:45.13]Character unlocked.
[192:45.89]Cannibal.
[192:48.55]Big quest done for this level.
[192:51.53]Can't hit people of your own class.
[192:54.39]Explosions caused by the player don't damage me.
[192:56.89]And all map markers are filled at the beginning of levels.
[193:00.52]Not bad.
[193:04.22]And let me go... I gotta go pee.
[193:06.93]Let me take this opportunity to actually go to the bathroom.
[193:08.93]It's been like three hours plus.
[193:10.67]I'm gonna go pee, grab some water.
[193:13.21]So I'll pause it right there.
[193:28.22]Industrial 1.
[193:28.84]Let me at least get through Industrial 1.
[193:30.36]Alright.
[193:31.79]Hang tight.
[193:33.23]I'll be right back.
[196:31.60]I am back.
[196:32.04]36, huh?
[196:34.36]That's a lot.
[196:39.16]Okay.
[196:41.47]Four.
[196:44.95]Here, rescue.
[196:45.93]I'll get shurikens.
[196:50.27]So I can teleport to these things?
[196:54.88]Well, that's real convenient.
[196:56.20]I thought you could only teleport at the end.
[196:57.78]Alright.
[197:04.94]Let's go in here.
[197:06.60]No, what do I want to do?
[197:16.71]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[197:20.18]I need friends before I do this.
[197:21.34]Should I call the number?
[197:23.68]Maybe I should give the phone call.
[197:32.33]I didn't do anything.
[197:33.03]Who did that?
[197:35.53]What?
[197:35.93]I didn't even do anything.
[197:37.87]Should I do grenade or grenade?
[197:39.77]Which one?
[197:48.54]What does this do?
[197:53.34]Is that just higher crit chance?
[197:54.58]How does that work?
[197:55.94]I'm not sure.
[198:04.01]We're going to find out.
[198:04.73]I've had it a couple times before.
[198:06.99]Alright, it had nothing to do with that.
[198:12.49]Alright, so... Electro Pill.
[198:19.80]Apparently three or four of them... Three were killed.
[198:23.37]Oh shit.
[198:24.55]Hi guys.
[198:24.81]What are you talking about?
[198:30.14]Join me.
[198:31.80]I'm not in good enough shape to join you.
[198:33.62]Oh.
[198:35.04]They already did it.
[198:38.80]I took too long, probably.
[198:40.00]Alright, let's go.
[198:45.04]I think they're getting killed right now.
[198:50.48]Oh, there we go.
[198:51.12]Sleeping.
[198:52.60]Come here.
[198:53.78]Let's be friends.
[198:56.82]Kill the weaklings.
[198:57.90]I'm not gonna do that.
[199:02.03]Oh.
[199:02.75]Offer motivation.
[199:08.79]You're the best.
[199:10.53]We just had a beer?
[199:12.51]Motivation for what?
[199:25.05]We're gonna go down.
[199:40.40]Don't stand over there.
[199:42.36]What are you doing?
[199:43.02]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.
[199:44.54]Why am I supposed to stop him from doing that?
[199:49.98]I...
[199:54.60]What's wrong with me?
[199:57.98]I'm confused right now.
[199:59.89]Five dollars again.
[200:00.89]I told myself I was never going to do that again.
[200:11.81]Whatever, let's go.
[200:12.69]I'm done.
[200:13.03]No, there's one more person that has to die.
[200:16.35]One more red.
[200:25.69]Okay, confusion is gone.
[200:26.97]You know when there's more money in a trash can?
[200:33.47]That this shit wasn't worth getting.
[200:35.45]Any chests.
[200:36.49]Come on.
[200:37.85]There we go.
[200:40.14]How are you guys still walking around?
[200:45.06]Come on, I can't break it from here.
[200:51.92]Oh shit, I'm sorry, man.
[200:53.56]That was brutal.
[201:05.90]It's done.
[201:07.04]Goodbye.
[201:09.96]Let's refill my shotgun.
[201:13.92]Freeze ray?
[201:14.44]Just spend the money.
[201:16.28]What am I going to spend it on?
[201:17.05]Just refill everything.
[201:23.37]Watch out.
[201:32.84]Here we go.
[201:33.16]I don't think I've ever seen below 2-1.
[201:41.73]I don't think so.
[201:42.43]Alright, so we got a neutralized worker.
[201:50.64]Okay, let's start with that one.
[202:00.79]Wanna talk?
[202:02.09]Borrow $50?
[202:02.87]How many times can I do this?
[202:55.93]Why do I still have debt?
[203:01.80]Debt to who?
[203:10.00]I just put money in there.
[203:10.95]There's no way it's not in there.
[203:13.61]He was a bank owner.
[203:19.85]Neutralize?
[203:20.79]Sure thing.
[203:21.39]Let's go with something creative.
[203:33.67]Who's fighting?
[203:37.27]A fight!
[203:38.39]Let me see!
[203:43.18]Anybody else?
[203:45.54]Alright, I got a team now.
[203:51.32]You guys all have guns?
[204:07.43]He just got... Guys, what the fuck are you doing?
[204:16.45]Why did that happen?
[204:18.63]There was no reason for that.
[204:26.38]Who's team or... Who's... I don't know who's fighting who.
[204:33.38]I'm just gonna pick the stuff up that dropped.
[204:39.14]Okay.
[204:39.90]Um... Neutralize.
[204:41.86]You!
[204:46.68]Got him!
[204:49.92]That guy's strong.
[204:55.04]We good?
[204:56.58]Alright, nice.
[204:58.90]So that's done.
[205:01.28]Got the money on that one.
[205:02.36]Now we have to go to the left.
[205:05.95]Fuck the chests.
[205:06.67]I'm not getting any of those.
[205:07.49]There's no reason to pick any of them up, ever.
[205:09.75]Where are you going?
[205:21.00]Firefighters?
[205:21.88]Why are they their own faction?
[205:29.28]Destroy the crate and get a blueprint.
[205:48.38]Hey, give me that money!
[206:01.36]People just freak out randomly and start hurting each other.
[206:03.54]Alright, I can destroy the crate.
[206:09.19]Can I do anything with you?
[206:10.79]Such a rowdy group we've got here.
[206:12.13]I didn't... Why does this guy have a gun?
[206:15.61]Alright, here's the idea.
[206:18.98]Freeze, freeze, grab the crate, get the hell out.
[206:20.90]I don't have enough room.
[206:31.52]Oh my god.
[206:35.80]Okay, got it.
[206:42.50]Fight!
[206:42.94]Fight!
[206:43.86]Fight!
[206:44.94]Fight, please!
[206:48.71]You're wrong, you're wrong, sucker!
[206:52.57]I gotta turn the quest in.
[206:56.51]Bobby, you have time for those chicken nuggets, thank you very much.
[207:05.13]Alright.
[207:06.63]Destroy the generator.
[207:09.11]There's still three.
[207:09.93]There we go.
[207:10.47]What's going on, boys?
[207:15.49]Ham sandwich.
[207:16.29]What?
[207:16.85]Oh.
[207:21.38]Let's roll.
[207:23.14]Two in here.
[207:27.34]There are other people playing this game on this same map.
[207:30.78]I'm convinced.
[207:36.51]Well, let's go destroy this.
[207:47.51]Just go in.
[207:49.91]Don't let them touch the king.
[207:50.93]Don't let them touch the fucking king!
[207:54.15]Holy shit.
[207:54.83]Get me out.
[207:57.83]He's shooting the cops.
[207:59.63]Oh no.
[208:01.35]Oh no.
[208:02.69]Oh no.
[208:03.03]Here comes a fireman.
[208:06.65]Holy shit.
[208:07.91]Oh my god.
[208:10.43]Um.
[208:14.18]Is everything alright?
[208:15.76]Is it safe to come out of the hole?
[208:26.93]Okay.
[208:28.03]I think it's okay.
[208:32.73]18 bucks.
[208:39.81]What is wrong with everybody right now?
[208:41.29]Why is everybody such a psycho?
[209:03.83]I gotta get more items.
[209:04.85]I have too many nuggets.
[209:08.47]Too many nuggets.
[209:11.35]I'm full of nuggets.
[209:33.95]Is this thing still going to work?
[209:47.02]No, it's not.
[209:48.90]When the camera turns around, right?
[209:50.00]Yeah.
[209:50.20]I don't want to read the damn emails.
[209:53.48]Let's go.
[209:56.17]There's still three.
[209:56.99]How am I going to do this?
[210:06.41]If I make grenades, I have to have like a grenade, right?
[210:08.33]Wait.
[210:12.95]Shit.
[210:17.56]No, he has to die.
[210:18.84]He can't just run away.
[210:19.48]Come here, come here, come here.
[210:24.28]Slip on that.
[210:33.53]Why?
[210:35.45]You're not that strong.
[210:37.00]One more and that's it.
[210:52.72]Up here?
[210:54.31]Maybe.
[210:54.93]In the jail?
[210:55.47]It's not worth breaking in there.
[210:58.05]I will just kill myself
[211:04.60]You're gonna be in Vegas?
[211:06.94]What's a restaurant?
[211:08.32]Hash House A Go-Go.
[211:09.16]It's in the link.
[211:11.29]It's a 24-hour restaurant.
[211:12.21]They have some of the best burgers I've ever had.
[211:13.47]The place is insane.
[211:15.43]Please eat there.
[211:22.85]Are one of these firefighters?
[211:24.91]One of the red team?
[211:31.38]Wait, sell-o-matic, thank god.
[211:34.01]What the hell do I want to get rid of here?
[211:35.53]I can't, um... Boombox?
[211:45.01]Just sell the syringe, right?
[211:46.79]What the hell am I going to do with this?
[211:47.71]I have too many items.
[212:00.07]Inject?
[212:01.29]It's like taking a pill in Isaac.
[212:05.74]It could be horrible, or it could get 28 bucks.
[212:11.09]Sell the cigarettes, yeah.
[212:17.25]What does it's in the link mean?
[212:18.73]The link, L-I-N-Q, is a casino in Vegas on the Strip.
[212:25.49]It is a casino.
[212:27.63]It's the link, L-I-N-Q.
[212:29.72]Alright, where is this last red guy?
[212:35.08]Found him.
[212:48.97]I sleep in a bed.
[212:49.89]Isn't this against, like, gangster code?
[213:05.86]Well, that was horrible.
[213:11.60]Didn't even get a chance.
[213:12.48]Uh, what do I have?
[213:14.48]Give me the shotgun ammo.
[213:18.15]Freeze.
[213:18.41]Done.
[213:18.67]Yeah.
[213:22.17]Let's leave.
[213:24.13]Out.
[213:31.88]Homesickness killer.
[213:32.86]Followers will always follow you to the next level.
[213:34.76]You can break walls or... I'll take any of these.
[213:46.37]This guy's a psycho!
[213:48.00]What's wrong with this guy?
[213:54.90]This one's good.
[214:02.86]Hey, thanks, guy.
[214:04.86]Oh.
[214:06.56]Radiation blasts.
[214:07.54]Radiation rains down upon all outdoor areas every 20 seconds.
[214:11.04]Find a bunch of hidden bombs before they decimate the area.
[214:14.13]Oh, there's a war going on.
[214:18.13]Not a fan of any of these.
[214:22.57]There's a war going on.
[214:25.85]Or, deactivate the hidden bombs.
[214:37.68]Should I just stand still?
[214:38.60]Should I call?
[214:44.32]Maybe I should make a phone call.
[214:52.14]Is it just that one guy versus everybody?
[214:54.00]Uh... Don't get in the middle.
[215:06.69]Okay.
[215:09.53]Where are they going, though?
[215:21.02]They're not shooting me, right?
[215:22.60]No.
[215:22.74]They're fighting each other.
[215:26.06]Are they fighting each other?
[215:28.02]I have no idea what's going on.
[215:29.60]But I'm going to take my advantage here.
[215:33.17]I'm going to beat the rat.
[215:34.25]Wait, should I just hide in the toilet?
[215:43.81]That guy has an item.
[215:52.51]I get the item from... What is that thing?
[215:58.18]No, no.
[215:58.54]Just... Just climb in the window before this guy dies.
[216:02.62]Okay.
[216:15.00]Okay.
[216:21.98]How big of an explosion is this going to be?
[216:29.01]Identify one sword.
[216:31.85]Oh, identify the syringes in my inventory.
[216:38.60]We need to know what they are so I can throw them away.
[216:51.04]You must sword.
[216:52.10]Alright, thank you.
[216:58.25]Alright, let's take a look and see what this is.
[217:01.51]Everything I got away.
[217:04.39]What's left?
[217:08.37]Uh... I gotta retrieve the hard drive from the safe.
[217:11.57]Just down... Over here.
[217:13.27]Okay.
[217:13.61]Holy shit.
[217:15.77]Oh god.
[217:16.27]Run.
[217:19.19]Uh...
[217:31.38]They're not trying to kill me.
[217:36.44]Who are they trying to kill?
[217:37.42]I need a better weapon than this.
[217:44.11]I need a shotgun for this one.
[217:46.51]Pick up two goons.
[217:55.79]This is really sloppy, but whatever.
[218:08.49]Soldier versus the cannibals.
[218:17.57]One more guy up here.
[218:20.19]And then I guess I'm gonna leave.
[218:21.85]I'm not getting stuck in this.
[218:27.09]Okay.
[218:32.22]Hmm, shit.
[218:35.44]They're coming to the bar now.
[218:36.46]They're coming to the bar.
[218:37.38]Maybe he'll just die.
[218:38.32]Oh god, he's gonna kill me.
[218:40.23]Freeze ray.
[218:44.99]Oh god, get me out of the bar!
[218:47.89]Kill him!
[218:48.25]Alright, he's dead, right?
[218:49.53]Out, out, out, out, out.
[218:50.55]Do you have soda?
[218:55.11]Rage poison?
[218:57.97]Holy shit, help me.
[219:00.05]Somebody help me, please!
[219:01.15]Help me!
[219:17.12]Uh, refill the shotgun and... that's it.
[219:30.66]Somebody help me!
[219:31.84]There's too many cannibals!
[219:36.86]I'm freaking out right now, this sucks.
[219:49.40]Please, I can't teleport.
[219:51.24]I have to go up.
[219:58.06]Heal?
[219:58.40]I have nothing to heal with.
[219:59.26]I don't have any more stuff to heal with.
[220:02.54]Eat the cheeseburger.
[220:04.40]I can't, I press an F, it's not doing anything.
[220:08.44]I don't have anything, see?
[220:13.81]The box?
[220:14.11]What do you mean the box?
[220:14.77]The box?

[221:14.76]Wait.
[221:26.65]Ah!

[221:29.49]What is going on?
[221:30.13]Stop, please!
[221:33.08]Alright, I'm just right here.
[221:34.60]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[221:37.76]I don't care if I didn't do everything.
[221:45.57]I did it.
[221:47.41]Firearms plus for money every day.
[222:01.00]Which one do you think I should do?
[222:08.07]How much money is it?
[222:14.85]How many nuggets?

[222:38.02]Warning, outsiders will be horribly mutilated.
[222:40.42]So in reality, you're not really that welcome at all.
[222:43.21]I apologize for misleading you.

[226:36.96]I just got screwed.
[226:55.35]Time to go back to Boston.
[227:03.15]Alright, I got a lot of potatoes or whatever these are.
[227:10.16]What is this?
[227:26.39]You know what's funny?
[227:26.83]I don't know which one of these images could be the one that's the artwork.
[227:33.13]Which one is the interpretation?
[227:34.29]I don't know.
[227:45.26]Sometimes I don't know.
[227:57.32]Okay.

[228:07.57]Friend phone as a reward.
[228:08.97]That's pretty good.
[228:13.59]Flamethrower?
[228:14.43]Yeah.
[228:16.47]Sledgehammer?
[228:17.07]Yes.
[228:20.79]Killer thrower?
[228:24.97]Yeah.
[228:28.49]A cube of lampy?
[228:34.97]Window cutter?
[228:36.18]Ooh.
[228:40.52]A leaf blower causes extreme noise pollution, aggravating bedroom programmers the world over.
[228:45.90]But in this game, it creates a huge gust of wind.
[228:52.45]Alright, let's go check out the perks.
[229:02.77]Thieving tools may not break after usage.
[229:05.99]Hiring people costs less.
[229:07.11]I don't need to do that.
[229:08.91]Items purchased from vendors may be given to you for free.
[229:14.40]I like this one.
[229:17.56]Hitting objects and walls doesn't make any noise.
[229:20.62]That's awesome.
[229:24.72]Lasers ignore you.
[229:26.49]Pass by lasers undetected.
[229:28.01]Yes.
[229:35.37]Alright.
[229:36.73]I just unlocked a lot of stuff.
[229:48.77]Remove bad traits from the pool.
[229:52.19]Click unlocked items to remove from the in-game pool.
[229:58.56]So I can take them out from here.
[229:59.76]Alright, let's see.
[230:02.10]What are bad ones?
[230:04.57]Can I take out as many as I want?
[230:14.31]Well, I like these ones.
[230:22.79]Which one sucks?
[230:27.75]That's good.
[230:28.29]That's good.
[230:29.95]Syringes are authentic.
[230:32.68]These are all kind of good.
[230:42.54]I don't hate... Okay, I hate this one.
[230:46.94]I don't like that one.
[230:57.10]Okay, I need to have 38.
[231:02.85]Which one of these sucks?
[231:06.55]Well, I don't want this.
[231:07.39]I'm not playing as a gorilla.
[231:14.15]Weapon, sword, sugar.
[231:17.60]Interesting.
[231:19.86]Shotgun is good.
[231:21.32]Safe cracking tool.
[231:22.06]I don't think I'm going to ever use this.
[231:31.37]No.
[231:34.27]No.
[231:36.61]Doesn't do it for me.
[231:40.48]Identify Wand is alright.
[231:41.80]Hacking Tool, Grenade.
[231:43.50]The Ghost Gun is pretty good.
[231:47.46]Fireproof Suit.
[231:48.38]I haven't even seen half of these.
[231:51.64]Door Detonator.
[231:54.46]Cigarettes.
[231:55.49]No, get these out of here.
[231:58.07]Cigarette Lighter.
[231:58.91]That's kind of cool.
[232:07.55]Okay.
[232:07.69]I'm alright with these.
[232:12.38]I don't need that identified wand anymore.
[232:14.06]But I have to get that actually as a... Yeah, that's true.
[232:17.20]Let's get rid of it.
[232:22.66]That's good.
[232:24.32]Alright, here we go.
[232:24.84]Try it again.
[232:33.55]So I have to do... To be able to start in industrial or park...
[232:42.07]Complete slums with five non-overpowered characters.
[232:45.76]And it will unlock it.
[232:50.92]Do gangster again.
[232:57.10]Put cigarettes in the air filters.
[232:59.05]Oh, that's just horrible.
[233:01.23]That's just mean.
[233:06.77]Alright.
[233:07.79]Straight up.
[233:14.66]Is there a recruit in here?
[233:17.48]Come with me.
[233:18.02]Alright, just E. Turn all these switches.
[233:25.13]Let's go.
[233:31.19]Play the Cannibal or Riot.
[233:34.13]I will try the Cannibal next round.
[233:40.46]I 100% promise.
[233:41.42]Did you even hit him once?
[233:42.32]I don't think you even
[233:50.63]One, two, three.
[233:58.87]Four dollars.
[233:59.72]Great.
[234:01.54]Okay, that's done.
[234:04.30]Bottom right.
[234:06.30]Can I get out from here?
[234:06.94]No.
[234:11.66]Yeah, I'll do a cannibal run.
[234:13.48]That sounds like fun.
[234:22.54]The bartender is on the red team?
[234:38.35]What?
[234:41.25]I didn't have to do that.
[234:42.87]Why did I do that?
[234:50.17]I saw the yellow-orange indicator.
[234:52.20]I thought that was... Well, that was dumb.
[234:57.94]Oh, we're going in here.
[235:08.28]Didn't take very much damage.
[235:09.14]We're good.
[235:10.86]Okay, retrieve the photo and then get out.
[235:17.51]Use the gun for this.
[235:24.53]And then you're over here.
[235:25.99]Over here.
[235:40.06]Whoa!
[235:41.60]Holy shit!
[235:49.27]Let's go.
[235:49.49]Alright, give me the flamethrower!
[235:51.89]Flamethrower!
[235:52.35]Flamethrower!
[235:55.01]You know you want to see it.
[235:55.75]I want to see it too.
[235:56.37]Pyromaniacs rejoice.
[236:10.89]With this weapon you can burn down certain walls and objects.
[236:13.57]People?
[236:18.53]It's kind of sad.
[236:24.84]See what it looks like.
[236:26.36]That looks pretty cool.
[236:31.02]Done.
[236:31.80]Out.
[236:39.18]Safe in crowds.
[236:40.66]Nimble fingers.
[236:42.46]Or backstabber.
[236:56.91]What's it gonna be, guys?
[236:58.81]What do you think?
[237:02.97]I would say this one.
[237:04.61]Because I'm playing as the blue gang members.
[237:12.18]But you do what you want.
[237:15.36]I am but a humble servant.
[237:18.80]Who's up?
[237:21.88]Alright, straight up in here.
[237:25.38]There are two.
[237:26.02]Let's go in here and get you.
[237:30.59]Chest in there.
[237:31.29]Bartender.
[237:31.91]Excuse me, bartender.
[237:40.05]No, I'm not going to torch this bar.
[237:42.91]Not worth it.
[237:45.81]So we're up here.
[237:57.15]Mmm, gorilla in the cage?
[238:01.19]Can I purchase loose hairs from you?
[238:04.40]Um... No.
[238:10.50]No, you're gonna, like, put it into a petri dish and try to, like, make some kind of monster or something.
[238:17.54]No.
[238:18.28]I don't want you using my DNA for anything.
[238:21.00]Alright, how do I, um... I think I have to get rid of the
[238:27.46]Yeah, I gotta get rid of the slave master.
[238:32.91]Alright, knife.
[238:34.97]No!
[238:35.15]Alright, flamethrower.
[238:35.83]Let's try it.
[238:41.93]Works pretty good.
[238:42.43]I got a leaf blower.
[238:43.05]Nice.
[238:43.53]No, I didn't.
[238:44.35]You guys have to pick it, don't you?
[238:47.86]Alright, up here.
[238:49.46]This thing's awesome.
[238:51.04]Flamethrower's pretty good.
[238:54.64]Here we go.
[239:02.34]Did I use the horn?
[239:04.60]Alright, I gotta get in here and help.
[239:10.05]We're good.
[239:12.09]Didn't lose anybody, did I?
[239:13.93]You shouldn't have come in here.
[239:15.40]That was... Just leave him alone.
[239:28.02]How am I good?
[239:28.60]How am I good today?
[239:29.24]How am I doing today?
[239:30.88]I'm good.
[239:32.14]I'm doing pretty well.
[239:34.58]How about you?
[239:35.06]You doing good?
[239:48.02]Ow.
[239:50.00]Damn it, that hurt a lot.
[239:54.35]Give me the key.
[239:56.03]Give me the- no, give me the key.
[240:10.32]Got it.
[240:13.24]You made amazing roasted potatoes.
[240:17.51]I haven't had roasted potatoes in a long time.
[240:18.97]I know that sounds really strange for someone to say that, but I don't, I've never had, it's been probably like a few months since I've had roasted potatoes in the oven.
[240:38.73]It's not something I'd really make or eat.
[240:44.52]But I will take the sledgehammer.
[240:48.50]Let's try it.
[240:48.92]Oh, I can't break these walls.
[240:54.16]Oh, I gotta go over here to the thief.
[240:59.45]Take the horn out.
[241:09.72]over here and have it blow up no this is just a noisemaker I forgot oh god damn it stupid thing I'm so stupid I just have tunnel vision and look straight ahead every time and now I can't even get over there
[241:40.42]Sucks.
[241:48.17]Go!
[241:51.27]Thank god.
[241:58.52]That hurts a lot.
[242:09.08]You are very smart.
[242:10.66]Hey, thanks.
[242:11.10]Hurt him.
[242:30.67]Fake message.
[242:31.69]That's fine.
[242:34.20]Let me get up.
[242:39.66]I don't care.
[242:40.08]It's going to be $5.
[242:40.66]You all know it.
[242:42.44]Give me something good.
[242:47.70]Ooh.
[242:53.35]I wonder how much that compounds on top.
[243:00.47]Either one of these are good.
[243:02.69]All three of them.
[243:03.47]Worth picking.
[243:21.41]oh no oh do this one do this one shifting status effects players and npcs get new status effects every 10 seconds or ooze lots of rioters are causing chaos in the streets
[243:48.83]Might need to use the phone on this one.
[243:54.13]Maybe I'll just run to the end.
[244:01.39]There are seven of them.
[244:04.53]Really?
[244:06.07]Oh dear.
[244:07.67]Riot, riot, riot, riot.
[244:24.37]Good.
[244:25.05]Let's give you the money.
[244:26.63]Alright, I need to get the crate.
[244:30.91]Come here.
[244:33.53]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[244:34.29]Down here.
[244:34.59]Down here.
[244:34.81]Where are you going?
[244:36.29]Follow me.
[244:36.61]Need another recruit.
[244:48.33]Hahaha.
[244:51.08]I feel like I'm playing Mordhau all over again.
[244:53.10]Get back here!
[244:54.46]Just wait!
[244:57.16]Stop running away!
[244:58.38]Get over here!
[244:59.52]No.
[245:02.36]Whatever.
[245:03.82]It's fine.
[245:08.21]Just got your ass kicked.
[245:10.51]I'm coming in.
[245:11.21]Clean it up, don't worry.
[245:13.19]Papa Jeremy's got it under control.
[245:21.66]I got some stuff I think I want to sell here.
[245:23.12]Banana peel, don't want to take up enough inventory space.
[245:26.88]These syringes, um... I don't know.
[245:31.50]Get rid of the baseball bat.
[245:32.52]Don't need it.
[245:34.86]Okay.
[245:40.54]Come here.
[245:45.16]Tom, I'm trying to get you to follow me around and you just keep... whatever.
[245:50.73]We're on the same damn team anyways.
[245:52.05]Who cares?
[245:52.55]Okay... Straight ahead.
[246:05.11]In this labyrinth here.
[246:06.51]What?
[246:06.79]I got the axe.
[246:16.21]Wrench?
[246:18.05]What did I hit the cop for?
[246:18.97]That was stupid.
[246:29.55]Alright, can we relax?
[246:38.61]Gotta get in there.
[246:46.54]Get the fuck away from me.
[246:52.02]Oh no.
[246:53.72]The drug dealer is dead.
[246:57.34]I'm just gonna take one of these syringes.
[246:59.22]That's why I should sell all of them.
[247:07.22]I just went in a full circle.
[247:09.92]How do I get in here?
[247:12.24]All the way down here?
[247:12.86]How did I miss this?
[247:21.30]Oh, looks like I'm in a weird spot.
[247:25.56]Don't touch that.
[247:26.22]It's a pressure plate.
[247:36.28]I deserve that.
[247:37.18]Oh well.
[247:37.96]Damn it.
[247:41.74]I deserve that.
[247:45.27]Can't even pick up the cigarettes can I?
[247:46.39]Yeah I can.
[247:51.43]I need an ammo crate.
[248:17.53]Killer Thrower.
[248:21.67]Seems like that's going to be the one.
[248:28.32]Did you use the item voucher from last run?
[248:31.48]Oh, yeah, I think so.
[248:33.66]Remember I got the underwear?
[248:39.66]So that's it.
[248:40.10]I need two more.
[248:40.82]Where are they?
[248:42.99]Oh, they're all the way down here.
[248:43.95]Really?
[248:44.17]Come on.
[248:54.81]No bartender dead Alright, let's do this Did you say I think you stink I think you stink Where's the last one
[249:29.10]I do not stink.
[249:30.96]I can promise you that.
[249:34.14]Come on, let me Pac-Man this guy.
[249:35.16]Damn it.
[249:36.72]Pac-Man, kill him!
[249:44.17]God damn it.
[249:45.79]Get over here!
[249:47.55]No!
[249:48.47]Please!
[249:54.79]Ugh!
[250:07.13]Somebody took a syringe and became invisible.
[250:11.61]Where are they?
[250:12.11]Alright, I'm out.
[250:13.65]Goodbye.
[250:18.24]Wait.
[250:19.20]Recruit this guy.
[250:25.12]Oh, please.
[250:25.92]Just get away from me.
[250:27.88]Okay, I can bring these recruits downstairs, right?
[250:34.51]Just leave!
[250:36.11]No, not yet.
[250:36.57]Hold on.
[250:39.33]Somebody dropped food?
[250:43.28]Help me up here, please.
[250:44.06]Alright, fuck it, just leave.
[250:49.64]Okay guys, if there's food available, give it to me.
[251:05.27]Any food, bad.
[251:06.21]I have plenty of money.
[251:08.49]There's nobody there.
[251:10.94]Just gotta do the two missions and get out.
[251:15.32]There is a level up soon.
[251:16.32]You're right, you're right, you're right.
[251:17.14]I should probably calm down.
[251:27.22]Can I... Wait.
[251:28.50]Can I use the wrench on this and make it so it doesn't do anything?
[251:32.90]Can I save?
[251:34.50]I feel like that would work.
[251:41.95]Can I do that?
[251:44.87]Yes, right?
[251:46.67]Yes, you can.
[251:47.29]Oh god.
[251:51.50]I don't know what to do.
[251:57.14]I'm stuck.
[251:57.70]I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
[252:20.27]Okay.
[252:20.89]I'm fine.
[252:21.65]Oh, thank god I leveled up.
[252:22.65]Holy shit.
[252:23.37]That was horrible.
[252:34.44]Safe combination.
[252:35.08]Get it.
[252:39.57]Well.
[252:44.35]I'm not gonna use this right now.
[252:46.73]I'm thinking I just sell that.
[252:47.93]That's gonna kill me.
[252:51.36]I'm actually gonna die from that.
[252:53.02]I can probably guarantee it.
[253:00.56]You suck, but I like this stream.
[253:02.81]Well, thank- hey, thanks.
[253:04.13]I appreciate that.
[253:10.35]Glad you like the stream.
[253:11.61]Welcome.
[253:12.91]If you like what you see, then let's hang out.
[253:18.42]Not in real life, I mean just like here.
[253:22.48]I unlocked the shopkeeper.
[253:23.60]Ooh.
[253:33.00]I finally got some more weapons.
[253:35.96]I feel safe now.
[253:39.84]Keep the baseball bat.
[253:40.60]Alright.
[253:41.66]Now we gotta do, uh, over here.
[253:43.29]Get that worker.
[253:47.49]You know, I do want you to come from the door, please.
[253:57.96]Can I come over?
[254:03.34]You're already here.
[254:05.24]You're already here.
[254:09.17]Just stay.
[254:10.49]You're just a free kill to whoever is over here.
[254:22.79]How do I do this without... Um...
[254:34.27]I can't open this.
[254:36.13]Stand back.
[254:44.78]Oh, you asshole.
[254:45.42]Just get out here.
[254:50.56]Good.
[254:50.78]Didn't have to blow it up.
[254:52.83]Out.
[255:00.59]All these are pretty good, except that I don't use the door detonators.
[255:03.35]Ever.
[255:25.17]Hmm.
[255:26.87]Mini fridge is probably the best.
[255:29.31]That'll help me.
[255:29.87]Because then food will be more filling.
[255:35.92]That's it, I'm out.
[255:42.78]You idiot.
[255:43.70]Not you, me.
[255:45.26]Let's get out.
[255:51.61]Nobody else is on this floor.
[255:53.01]What about... Wait, hold on.
[255:53.93]I think there's a cell machine over here.
[255:58.01]Alright, let me sell.
[255:59.23]This knife is worthless.
[256:03.37]I'm selling the syringes.
[256:04.67]I'm not gonna use them.
[256:07.09]I haven't even... What about the boombox?
[256:08.61]I've never even turned it on.
[256:09.39]I think I'm good.
[256:22.44]Sell the killer thrower.
[256:23.48]I feel like I could use that pretty well somewhere.
[256:28.19]Hitting walls and objects doesn't make any sound.
[256:30.47]Can't hit people of your own class.
[256:32.57]And can't hit most people you are aligned with.
[256:37.35]Good stuff.
[256:45.66]Oh, those of you that weren't here, tomorrow... Tomorrow we're going to do a comb stream...
[256:51.71]That's right.
[256:52.19]I'm going to do tier lists, flash games, and some other just bullshit.
[257:01.41]I got so addicted to doing those tier lists, I want to do them again.
[257:03.59]Don't let it be tomorrow night.
[257:08.62]And if you're fairly new to the channel and you don't know what a comb stream is, uh, it's a stream where I just put on the webcam and we just do, like, fuck all for like four or six hours.
[257:20.57]We just do whatever.
[257:21.57]Alright, what do I want to do here?
[257:32.10]A lot of stuff to do.
[257:35.68]It's gonna go right at the front door.
[257:41.25]It's the streams where we get footage for our deep fakes.
[257:48.37]Probably true.
[257:50.23]Probably correct.
[257:52.34]Alright, let's get right up here.
[257:53.30]That's the best way to get in here.
[258:01.58]I don't want to do this.
[258:04.21]Can I, like, honk on this and have it not work?
[258:08.37]What about the wrench?
[258:12.30]Use wrench to deactivate.
[258:16.84]Minus 30?
[258:19.03]I can only do that once.
[258:23.99]I need a silent killer.
[258:27.23]This all makes way too much noise.
[258:28.83]Okay, what if I, like, honk blast him through his own laser?
[258:36.31]Kind of.
[258:36.89]A little.
[258:37.41]Sort of.
[258:38.46]Sort of worked.
[258:41.02]Do I have any of the melee weapons?
[258:42.34]No.
[258:48.36]Let's beat the shit out of him.
[258:50.46]Oh fuck, he got a bat.
[258:51.19]He's got a bat.
[258:51.63]He's got a bat.
[258:52.01]He's got a bat.
[258:52.37]He's got a bat.
[258:52.83]Shoot him in the head.
[258:53.63]Okay, I'm good.
[258:59.15]The honk blast technique would have been pretty good.
[259:06.21]Will you eat five more McChickens?
[259:09.69]No.
[259:11.69]I gotta take a break from fast food.
[259:15.87]No more fast food for like a month.
[259:25.28]I don't eat it that often, but lately it's been... Yeah, you know what?
[259:29.06]I want Taco Bell.
[259:30.20]I want McChicken.
[259:34.87]There has not been a time in the last like month and a half where I've gone, yeah, I want a Cobb salad.
[259:40.09]Ooh, kale sounds good today.
[259:41.79]No.
[259:42.51]That has to stop.
[259:43.17]I have to start to actually care about that.
[259:48.61]Okay, so there's two more.
[259:51.27]So you come with me.
[259:53.63]Safe back there.
[259:54.25]Just open it.
[259:59.02]I got no reason to go in there.
[260:00.24]He's got the key to that safe, but there's going to be nothing in it.
[260:10.13]I haven't been eating unhealthy.
[260:12.69]I've just been craving all the unhealthy stuff.
[260:17.47]That doesn't mean I've been acting on it.
[260:18.51]Alright, you got a job for me?
[260:26.02]Neutralize the thief.
[260:28.26]Can I buy food from you?
[260:31.66]All you have is beers.
[260:32.50]I'll take them.
[260:52.26]Pretty loud speakers.
[261:05.53]Countries to visit on a vacation tier list.
[261:09.90]Yeah, if you guys got some good ones, then compile some for tomorrow.
[261:12.90]Because how we did it last time, I just picked up random ones from the chat.
[261:17.46]So if you find some good ones.
[261:18.46]I want to do a candy list.
[261:23.04]So if there's a good bunch of candies, chocolates, like Skittles, that type of thing.
[261:34.14]How do I get in here?
[261:41.53]Is it worth the 15 HP to actually 30 HP to go in here?
[261:44.47]No.
[261:48.45]Definitely not.
[261:56.88]Alright, am I allowed in here?
[262:01.40]Clerk.
[262:02.69]Alright, what about you?
[262:03.59]You got food?
[262:04.11]No, no, I'm not borrowing any more money.
[262:09.01]That ended very badly.
[262:10.41]Alright, so I have to go all the way down in the corner here.
[262:21.90]Don't let him alert anybody, good.
[262:24.42]Alright, somebody go get that security camera.
[262:26.38]Wait, can I just turn it off with the wrench?
[262:35.50]I got it!
[262:37.16]Too bad it still alerted everybody.
[262:40.88]Give me the bat.
[262:48.37]Disaster.
[262:49.49]Disaster.
[262:56.22]Alright, back to me, back to me, back to me.
[263:03.04]Rate everyone you've ever met.
[263:04.52]That's not gonna happen.
[263:15.23]I don't even remember anybody I've ever met.
[263:19.25]What am I talking about?
[263:19.97]Yes, I do.
[263:23.01]But hold on, I could probably name you... I can name you at least like 30 or 40 people.
[263:30.77]Do that right now.
[263:32.91]Can you name... Let's just say the last 100 people that you've met.
[263:36.94]I don't think you could.
[263:49.56]It would take a lot of thought.
[263:52.81]That's way too much.
[263:53.67]Yeah, okay, what about the last 20?
[263:57.31]And I'm talking, like, met for the first time.
[264:00.42]Where was it and who was it?
[264:04.52]Okay, I gotta kill everybody in here.
[264:09.43]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[264:11.11]All attack.
[264:12.47]Start with the goon.
[264:13.91]Neutralize the goon.
[264:14.59]Let's go.
[264:19.63]And then from behind the door, we just get a free shot here.
[264:26.31]You done?
[264:26.63]Oh, not you.
[264:28.89]You?
[264:29.13]I'm gonna get ready.
[264:29.78]You know what?
[264:30.44]We'll just hit you with the wrench a few times.
[264:31.82]No, what do I have?
[264:36.12]We can just beat this guy up.
[264:40.26]Open the doors.
[264:49.15]Got it, right?
[264:49.79]That's it.
[264:50.21]Three out of three.
[264:52.01]Let's move.
[264:52.33]You know, I actually, I probably think I would have trouble with the last five people that I've ever met.
[265:03.38]Can't do this from behind the wall.
[265:04.28]Alright, watch out.
[265:11.91]Back up.
[265:13.71]You fucking idiot.
[265:16.94]Blacha out.
[265:18.90]What is he doing?
[265:19.68]No, you were inside the Fortnite circle.
[265:32.62]You idiot.
[265:38.41]We had him.
[265:39.05]At least I won.
[266:06.38]Thankfully it didn't hit me.
[266:13.47]What the hell happened?
[266:16.81]They were here and now they're not!
[266:21.15]It was so unnecessary.
[266:22.07]I just took like 30 points of damage for no reason.
[266:25.93]I could just leave.
[266:26.55]Five nuggets.
[266:44.60]Ammo, though.
[266:46.28]Assist me.
[266:47.06]What?
[266:47.46]No.
[266:48.54]I can do that for free.
[266:53.41]Uhhh... Mmm. Let's refill the shotgun. Because I just wasted it all.
[267:00.00]Let's continue.
[267:03.00]Hello? Good, good, good.
[267:16.77]Turn on the facecam.
[267:17.77]No, I don't do facecam.
[267:20.77]Unless it's tomorrow.
[267:26.85]If it's tomorrow, then yeah, there'll be a facecam.
[267:43.19]There we go.
[267:45.81]Uh-oh.
[267:47.68]Which terrifying disaster?
[267:49.14]War on the streets, radiation rains down on all areas for every 20 seconds, or a bounty is placed on my head.
[268:00.24]Now, don't do Warzone again.
[268:03.70]Warzone is too random.
[268:05.18]Do the other one.
[268:06.62]Do this one.
[268:07.22]Don't do this one.
[268:08.08]Do one of these two.
[268:09.00]We haven't seen it yet.
[268:12.40]Two seconds, come on!
[268:14.26]No!
[268:16.78]And it won, too!
[268:17.96]I got shit for that before, closing the poll early.
[268:25.04]It's a war!
[268:26.16]Alright, well, let's just go do the stuff I need to do quickly.
[268:30.81]Like, kill this person.
[268:34.99]I didn't really mean to do that.
[268:36.41]Now he's running.
[268:36.87]Great.
[268:37.07]Come on.
[268:37.27]Come here.
[268:40.07]Oh, shit.
[268:40.73]Who's this?
[268:49.35]Alright, I need to neutralize this guy.
[268:56.83]I get them both, actually.
[268:57.88]Alright, well, eat this.
[269:00.76]Really?
[269:01.66]That sucks.
[269:04.42]Did I shoot a soldier?
[269:05.42]I shot a soldier.
[269:07.84]That's bad.
[269:08.44]I have the whole team on me.
[269:11.74]Oh, what have I done?
[269:12.80]Oh no, I'm freaking out.
[269:14.26]How do I teleport?
[269:20.31]Oh my god.
[269:20.91]Oh my god.
[269:22.09]Why did I do that?
[269:22.87]What's fucking wrong with me?
[269:24.03]No.
[269:27.61]Watch out for the train.
[269:35.11]I'm just gonna have to get out.
[269:36.29]Alright, we gotta kill the guy up here and get that thing and leave.
[269:44.56]Where's he going here?
[269:45.08]Okay, get in there.
[269:45.82]Where's the other red guy?
[269:59.69]Oh my fucking god.
[270:01.27]Killer thrower.
[270:01.81]What'd I do?
[270:03.21]What's going on?
[270:06.75]Killer thrower.
[270:14.27]This stupid... I can't believe I took that syringe.
[270:16.75]It doesn't do anything.
[270:18.06]Slow and confused.
[270:19.24]Great.
[270:20.12]I'm selling them every single time.
[270:23.44]Every single fucking time.
[270:29.43]No, please.
[270:30.62]Please, I have to aim the other way.
[270:59.94]Give me the axe.
[271:08.23]Done.
[271:13.65]I can get out of this.
[271:18.53]Onto the park.
[271:26.47]Okay, so this is... I activate it, and then when I throw something, they explode.
[271:37.27]I understand.
[271:37.73]This is probably the best.
[271:39.84]No ghosts.
[271:47.74]So the internet... This was kind of the first stream back to make sure that it worked and to test it.
[271:53.86]It's been okay.
[271:56.85]I have, in four and a half hours, just over, like, 1% drop frames.
[272:02.74]It hasn't really done anything terrible.
[272:05.80]Could be way worse.
[272:06.96]If you were here a few days ago, like, four or five days ago, it was unbearable.
[272:10.18]I couldn't even stream.
[272:13.76]Let's hope they continue to figure out what's going on.
[272:17.45]1% is bad?
[272:17.93]Oh, yeah, it's bad.
[272:18.81]But it's better than, like, 30%, which is what it was before.
[272:22.21]And dropping to zero in the stream, turns out.
[272:27.87]It's gonna keep happening.
[272:29.77]All I can do is deal with it and try to get it fixed.
[272:34.03]So... At least I can have my screen be on and not just turn the damn thing off.
[272:38.56]Alright, here we go.
[272:41.90]Now I gotta do... Everything's clear, everything's done, get me out.
[272:53.87]Yeah, forget it.
[272:55.21]Holy shit, who are you?
[273:08.90]he jinxed it he started saying the words if you say the if you say c-o-x in a row as the word is spelled out your internet starts to turn off alright this is gonna be bad I haven't gotten past floor one here have I I'll take a soldier can I recruit you it's worth it
[273:34.51]No, it wasn't.
[273:35.35]Why the hell did I do that?
[273:37.27]I thought that was one soldier.
[273:39.29]No, actually that was worth it.
[273:40.45]I'm glad I did that.
[273:45.73]I put the jukebox down!
[273:47.81]Why are they not dancing?
[273:56.74]Oh no.
[274:08.15]There's a crazy person in that bush He's gonna run out with an axe
[274:40.21]What's going on?
[274:53.14]Why is he dancing?
[274:54.88]He's the only person that's dancing.
[274:56.48]Out of all the people that were able to dance, it's him dancing.
[274:59.96]Great.
[275:00.32]Alright, you know what?
[275:03.22]Fuck it.
[275:08.27]Okay, the axe is the best.
[275:11.81]383 dead.
[275:13.27]In the chest.
[275:16.19]That's good, too.
[275:20.97]Jerma, go in the water.
[275:21.84]Go in the water.
[275:22.36]That's not gonna go in the water.
[275:25.22]That would be a mistake.
[275:27.66]Ooh, shopkeeper.
[275:29.26]Nice.
[275:29.50]I still have to do the two missions.
[275:32.98]Okay.
[275:34.34]Can I buy stuff from you, please?
[275:38.33]Safe buster.
[275:40.21]Machine gun.
[275:40.89]I need the food.
[275:43.81]Taser.
[275:45.55]Can't afford it.
[275:48.73]What does the muscle pill do?
[275:53.05]So, activate that and just use the axe and just swing around in a circle.
[276:03.76]Watch out for... There are vampires in this game too.
[276:09.47]Why?
[276:09.75]Why are there vampires?
[276:18.37]Okay, the vampires are hostile to me?
[276:31.55]Alright, I've had just about enough of this shit.
[276:55.40]Which one?
[277:07.65]Too bad that wasn't a rocket launcher in Castlevania.
[277:10.89]That is too bad.
[277:13.89]Well, you had the holy water, right?
[277:14.94]Did you throw the flaming holy water?
[277:26.90]Thanks for the four-leaf clover.
[277:30.60]Okay.
[277:31.82]So now, just have to rescue this person and get 37 bucks and then get out.
[277:36.34]And there's a cell-o-matic over there, too.
[277:38.30]Good.
[277:38.98]In fact, you know what?
[277:39.58]Let's just sneak around.
[277:44.38]What the hell is that?
[277:53.39]What the hell is that?
[277:54.21]Leave now.
[277:54.73]Who?
[277:55.07]Me?
[277:59.90]He's throwing me?
[278:04.24]Whiskey.
[278:04.74]Yeah, I need it.
[278:07.26]I'm gonna sneak in here.
[278:17.05]Cell-o-matic, alright.
[278:18.87]How many syringes?
[278:19.57]Real cigarettes.
[278:22.89]Who is dying up there?
[278:25.52]Give me the knife.
[278:28.74]Probably the wrench, too.
[278:31.71]Did I sell the clover?
[278:34.23]Put the silencer on the pistol.
[278:40.53]That purple leg heals you.
[278:41.79]That is the most bullshit thing I've ever heard in my life.
[278:44.01]Oh, oh.
[278:55.82]Right click to combine.
[278:57.64]Left click to... Okay, there we go.
[279:02.58]Go in the purple water.
[279:05.46]Is the most horseshit thing I've ever heard.
[279:08.84]You want me to go in this water?
[279:10.08]And it's gonna heal me.
[279:11.21]Sure.
[279:11.83]Okay.
[279:14.05]If this poisons me, I get 5,000 subs.
[279:19.49]Oh, never mind.
[279:20.21]I don't get anything.
[279:24.70]Oh well.
[279:25.80]I don't get it.
[279:35.78]What are you so happy about?
[279:45.94]We get 5,000 now.
[279:46.60]Is this a range?
[279:53.32]No.
[279:53.38]Alright, let's go up here.
[280:06.62]Come on out.
[280:09.46]Give me this sword.
[280:20.19]$7.
[280:20.31]Wow.
[280:23.47]That's a lot of money.
[280:25.51]He has a gun, doesn't he?
[280:26.67]Yes, he does.
[280:27.01]Burn him.
[280:36.55]How did that miss?
[280:56.74]Let's go.
[281:01.90]Poison the water.
[281:02.94]No, don't, no, no, don't, don't, don't do that.
[281:04.32]Don't do that.
[281:14.61]I want to go into the water.
[281:21.33]Where'd it go?
[281:21.75]Oh, the jukebox is still down there.
[281:40.30]Okay.
[281:45.94]Uh-oh.
[281:46.56]I'm overstaying my welcome in here.
[281:48.40]What happens when it gets to zero?
[281:58.39]That's not a bad thing, right?
[282:00.53]Zero?
[282:02.19]No, okay.
[282:06.80]You can make a custom class in this game?
[282:08.16]That's pretty cool.
[282:10.54]Yeah, after this, I do want to see what I've unlocked.
[282:16.19]Watch out for cannibals.
[282:19.77]There's one over there.
[282:20.43]And we're good.
[282:27.32]Thank you.
[282:30.24]Floor clear.
[282:33.24]Three chicken nuggets.
[282:34.24]Good.
[282:42.10]Ooh.
[282:43.53]Pretty good.
[282:46.60]Can this game be a common stream choice from now on?
[282:49.94]Um, I don't know.
[282:50.38]I'm just kind of just playing it.
[282:53.50]Ever since it released, I've wanted to check it out.
[282:56.22]I'm not sure if I would do this all the time.
[283:00.55]There's a lot of content here, though.
[283:04.13]You could put a lot of time into this.
[283:11.63]So that means no.
[283:14.21]I didn't say that.
[283:16.15]I said, you can put a lot of time into this.
[283:17.95]Alright, we got a bunch of stuff over here.
[283:25.83]We got to neutralize some people, get that chest.
[283:27.99]I'll go for it.
[283:28.87]Sure.
[283:31.29]What the hell are these?
[283:32.11]Alright, there's killer plants now.
[283:41.55]I'm kind of curious what that means.
[283:42.59]What does killer plant mean?
[283:52.36]Can I pick it up?
[283:53.50]Can I have a killer plant?
[283:57.96]What does this do?
[283:59.10]It's not... Okay, there's no reason for me to do this.
[284:05.40]It's just a chest over here.
[284:11.40]Sugar.
[284:17.42]Speeds you up.
[284:19.19]Okay.
[284:21.27]Interesting.

[284:25.26]My guns are low.
[284:33.09]Shit.
[284:36.41]Could have seen you coming from a mile away, but I'm stupid.
[284:48.21]Shouldn't be that big of a problem.
[284:49.31]What I got rocket launcher right in front door That was pretty good No, no mystery item
[285:16.00]Let's do a ski thing, though.
[285:17.36]Cool.
[285:17.64]Alright, weapons, right?
[285:21.39]I'm gonna buy the sandwich.
[285:22.27]Yeah, I'm gonna buy both the heals.
[285:24.87]I need them!
[285:25.41]Alright, next is... I'm not doing that.
[285:42.91]I'll use a knife until it's gone.
[285:45.53]Clone machine.
[285:48.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[285:49.35]What am I cloning?
[285:49.95]I don't want to clone anything.
[285:50.81]Stop.
[285:53.29]No, what are you doing?
[285:53.83]Stop.
[285:54.05]No, I want to go in the door.
[285:56.22]I almost just stepped right on that.
[286:09.93]Moron.
[286:24.40]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[286:30.95]Where'd he go?
[286:40.36]Oh, shit.
[286:44.00]Well, there are the three.
[286:45.56]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[286:48.52]I'm gonna come down here.
[286:49.18]They're gonna die.
[286:49.66]No, I'll get them.
[286:57.93]Holy shit.
[287:09.56]Ow.
[287:12.00]He has to die.
[287:32.49]Only one more thing to do in the right side, and this is the other guy here, and then I can get out.
[287:37.89]I'm almost at the end of this area.
[287:43.69]Yeah, this is it.
[287:44.97]Then there's the third level.
[287:49.05]And then the fourth area, which is something we've not seen yet.
[287:53.03]Wonder what it is.
[287:53.82]I don't know.
[287:55.12]Find out.
[287:56.40]Give me the gun.
[288:03.81]What do you got?
[288:04.17]Give him the beers.
[288:10.56]Watch out for the bear traps.
[288:11.68]And where'd he go?
[288:12.38]Up here?
[288:12.66]Where the hell are you?
[288:20.29]Where'd he go?
[288:21.41]Down there?
[288:21.81]He needs one bullet.
[288:26.73]Where the hell is he?
[288:28.41]Is he hiding in a bush?
[288:32.38]Oh, it's the...
[288:34.07]Other one, up there.
[288:34.95]Pretty good.
[288:44.84]Oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass.
[288:49.66]These guys are all armed.
[288:54.38]I'm going to have to go for it.
[289:01.03]Oh, no.
[289:01.21]That would have been great.
[289:12.15]Got it.
[289:21.29]Give me the... I don't know.
[289:24.31]I don't know.
[289:25.22]I have no idea.
[289:26.16]They're all good.
[289:34.40]Oh, shit.
[289:42.10]Good choice.
[289:51.55]Good choice.
[289:52.29]Alright, I can leave, right?
[290:03.14]Yeah.
[290:03.86]That's it.
[290:05.84]There's other stuff dying.
[290:07.06]Mm-hmm.
[290:12.95]Bombs dropping hidden bombs or kill a robot?
[290:30.34]Is it gonna be three for three?
[290:42.67]These are all terrible.
[290:51.10]Where is he?
[290:51.56]Over there.
[290:51.90]Alright, I kind of got... Straight up in the middle.
[290:55.74]Alright, let me get a freeze ray.
[290:57.48]Just go.
[290:57.78]I have to go quick.
[291:05.13]Do I not have anything I can destroy the buckets with?
[291:22.30]Can I turn this off?
[291:24.04]With a wrench?
[291:24.84]How do I do this without getting hurt?
[291:27.80]Oh, fuck.
[291:28.50]I'm in trouble.
[291:28.98]I'm dead.
[291:29.64]I'm dead.
[291:30.34]I'm gonna die.
[291:35.52]I just unlocked a new character.
[291:39.09]No!
[291:40.15]God damn it!
[291:42.41]I'm so... Stupid poison barrels.
[291:47.41]I can't destroy them unless I fucking smash them.
[291:51.48]I'm going home.
[291:58.31]That's so aggravating.
[292:10.81]I gotta walk up and punch this thing because I don't have any bullets left.
[292:14.38]All the while, a robot's just walking down with a rocket launcher.
[292:20.12]Bullshit.
[292:21.64]Gimme this thing.
[292:30.39]I like that too I'm doing a new character.
[292:37.49]Let's see what we have Cannibal Feast on corpses to gain health
[292:52.69]If human meat is the only food that can restore your health, alcohol works too.
[292:57.57]Business owners want you to leave.
[292:59.53]Most people won't join your party.
[293:00.99]So I have to eat dead bodies?
[293:05.98]What was the other ones I got?
[293:07.04]Bartender.
[293:09.24]Serve cocktails to anyone, like it's your job or something.
[293:12.00]Okay.
[293:14.30]Most people are initially friendly toward you.
[293:16.82]Enter some private property without an issue.
[293:20.56]three followers can follow you and all syringes are identified interesting shopkeeper recognizes that everything has a price can purchase items from anyone at marked up prices and items in the shop cost less so you can purchase anything from anybody I think anybody else
[293:49.29]I feel like I got somebody else.
[293:50.05]Alright, let's try the cannibal.
[293:58.22]That's fine.
[294:00.34]Wait.
[294:05.12]So I have to eat people.
[294:06.02]I can only eat human meat and nobody likes me.
[294:13.60]So is this just like a murder run?
[294:19.85]Okay, eat a certain type of person.
[294:22.83]Eat a doctor.
[294:23.57]Oh, you're all safe.
[294:31.60]Create a character next time.
[294:32.85]Okay, I will.
[294:49.57]That's a lot of money.
[294:50.27]Okay, eat.
[294:50.87]How do I eat him?
[294:54.69]I'm stuffed.
[294:56.27]Oh, it's right click.
[295:00.39]So it heals.
[295:01.13]Okay, that's pretty ridiculous.
[295:02.13]Alright, eat a doctor.
[295:03.33]Okay, there's doctors in here.
[295:05.58]So let's go eat a doctor.
[295:16.82]Alright, well, that's actually really, really, really, really good of a perk.
[295:21.92]Alright, let's go do the missions.
[295:32.61]Do them both in a row.
[295:33.57]Destroy and retrieve.
[295:37.17]Let's go this way.
[295:41.65]This one first.
[295:42.09]No, we'll do this one first.
[295:58.79]Reward.
[295:59.37]Alright.
[296:01.25]Friend phone melee durability spray.
[296:06.05]That'll be good for the axe.
[296:16.72]More cannibals.
[296:17.66]Does this actually call other cannibals?
[296:21.30]That'd be kind of funny, actually.
[296:34.01]Oh shit.
[296:36.11]I'll just eat him.
[296:38.82]Is there a certain amount of people I can eat in one map?
[296:41.22]Or does it not matter?
[296:41.86]We hear traps too.
[296:43.36]Alright, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
[296:44.64]I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
[296:45.80]Look.
[296:46.81]You can watch me leave.
[296:48.43]I don't know how to get out.
[296:49.39]Where's the exit?
[296:52.27]I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm out!
[296:56.61]He whiffed.
[296:58.09]I'm gone.
[296:58.83]Leave me alone.
[297:00.73]Leave me alone.
[297:01.47]Look, I don't want to kill you.
[297:03.31]Look, I don't want to have to knock you out, okay?
[297:05.29]But I will.
[297:05.77]This guy is mad.
[297:08.25]Yeah, that's right.
[297:24.56]Run away.
[297:29.79]Alright.
[297:35.22]Hamburger?
[297:35.88]No, I sell it.
[297:36.72]I eat people.
[297:42.78]Oh, shit.
[297:49.05]Nice.
[297:49.67]I'll take it.
[297:50.05]This is gonna be interesting, though, because I have to destroy this.
[297:57.29]Um, okay.
[298:00.65]How does one get in there?
[298:02.97]Annoyed.
[298:03.85]Um... I can just break through.
[298:06.17]It's not really a reliable way to do this.
[298:14.48]Unless I... Maybe hold on.
[298:19.22]Oh, shit.
[298:22.03]Alright, I can do it.
[298:24.51]Did you actually see me?
[298:25.35]No, you didn't.
[298:30.51]No, no, no!
[298:30.89]Get out!
[298:31.39]Alright, good.
[298:36.25]Floor clear.
[298:37.23]Level up.
[298:40.20]We're good.
[298:40.52]Ate the doctor.
[298:41.86]Next level.
[298:45.00]I unlocked the Shapeshifter.
[298:49.56]Don't know what that does.
[298:57.35]Got a lot of characters.
[299:03.67]Shapeshifter is great.
[299:16.95]What'd he give me?
[299:25.64]All those were kind of not super great for this character.
[299:32.12]Alright, eat a cup.
[299:35.67]And do all these other missions.
[299:36.81]Okay.
[299:36.99]Need a cop.
[299:40.00]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[299:44.92]Alright.
[299:47.70]Another way to get in?
[299:48.26]Um... Nah, I'm just going to the front door.
[299:52.70]Screw it.
[299:54.80]Yeah, fuck it.
[299:55.38]Just come here.
[299:57.29]Tell me to leave.
[299:57.79]Yeah, get out of here.
[300:00.33]Get up.
[300:20.49]Grenade, hacking tool, boombox, or mini fridge?
[300:33.56]I'm currently resisting bullets, which is a good thing!
[300:41.83]Dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
[300:49.04]That's pretty split what boombox it is.
[301:02.95]I like this character.
[301:03.73]This character's really good.
[301:04.55]Alright, I gotta eat a cop.
[301:12.09]I don't like bananas.
[301:15.14]I only like humans.
[301:20.41]But it's free money.
[301:26.50]Retrieve the incriminating photo from the worker over here.
[301:30.64]I'll try.
[301:31.04]The alcohol still is good though, right?
[301:39.67]Yeah.
[301:50.48]Hmm front door.
[301:53.58]Yeah I'm just gonna wrench.
[302:05.53]Oh shit.
[302:07.15]Oh, it hurts I need to feed on more people.
[302:16.86]Okay, I gotta eat you
[302:25.47]You better stop that.
[302:26.61]Ooh, I gotta eat that cop.
[302:35.53]How am I gonna do this though?
[302:37.80]Bear trap?
[302:38.24]I'm gonna put like three bear traps down like right here.
[302:40.76]Okay.
[302:50.60]Done.
[302:57.53]Oh well.
[303:00.98]Very cool.
[303:04.84]Turn this in.
[303:09.38]These guys, they're not hostile, right?
[303:10.46]I keep thinking for some reason I'm playing so much on the gang character.
[303:13.88]Alright, now I've done that, I have to do these two up here and let's go.
[303:32.63]I'm just gonna go in.
[303:34.15]Break the window and just get it.
[303:38.33]Goodbye.
[303:41.91]No cop, right?
[303:50.56]Health is not a problem with this character, so I'm... It's alright.
[303:57.46]And then across the way... Wait, wait, wait, what's up here?
[303:59.13]Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[304:04.64]Just eat them both.
[304:10.84]Here comes one man spam.
[304:22.46]Cut that out.
[304:35.01]Final.
[304:35.68]Break out these two.
[304:36.78]Good.
[304:43.20]Alright.
[304:44.14]How do I do this without getting in trouble?
[304:47.28]I don't.
[304:53.75]That was that easy.
[305:01.46]Break them out and then eat them.
[305:03.62]Well, I don't need to.
[305:04.18]My health is fine.
[305:07.22]Good to go.
[305:15.28]I want to start playing this game again.
[305:17.72]Ooh.
[305:19.24]This one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one.
[305:20.76]Do this one.
[305:25.30]Bodies are cannibalized faster.
[305:27.16]There's nothing else that matters.
[305:28.04]Just press 1.
[305:33.89]No, it's a fun game.
[305:38.35]There's a lot to do.
[305:41.23]Kind of keeps the carrot on the stick in front of you with all the unlocks and all the perks you buy and stuff.
[305:48.20]That's good.
[305:50.44]Oh, here we go.
[305:52.82]Ooze, bombs dropping, or riot?
[305:57.20]We've seen riot.
[305:58.66]We've not seen ooze or bombs dropping.
[306:02.66]But it is chat, so... Chances are they're gonna pick the one.
[306:10.90]We're never gonna see... Oh, but there's an equal amount of fight against that!
[306:14.48]Yeah, we're gonna see Ooze.
[306:17.70]Ooze is spreading, don't touch it.
[306:21.22]Gotta be careful.
[306:28.01]Go!
[306:29.51]Don't touch the Ooze.
[306:40.02]Eat a goon.
[306:40.70]And then there's two things up there.
[306:42.56]Okay.
[306:42.88]Goon.
[306:43.18]Eat a goon.
[306:43.56]Oh, God.
[306:51.20]Come on.
[306:53.50]Let's see how long this takes.
[306:58.73]That's much faster.
[306:59.63]Alright.
[306:59.87]Cool.
[307:00.05]Let's open the... Let's open it.
[307:01.37]What about... Goon eaten.
[307:05.53]Goon eaten.
[307:09.84]I don't see very much ooze.
[307:14.68]Anybody see any ooze?
[307:15.68]That guy has a gun.
[307:31.97]Can I use guns?
[307:33.23]Yeah.
[307:35.01]Why am I acting like I can't use it?
[307:40.48]Turns out this one sucks.
[307:42.34]I don't see any danger at all.
[307:49.44]These ooze?
[307:50.12]I don't see ooze.
[307:55.21]No, this is safe.
[308:02.25]I do have to get rid of these, though.
[308:06.31]Turn around.
[308:08.56]Look at the map.
[308:12.87]This down here?
[308:23.22]Oh, it is spreading up here.
[308:24.20]I'm really far away though.
[308:36.11]I'll be done with this by the time it gets up here.
[308:42.61]We're good.
[308:47.31]Oh god.
[308:47.85]Oh fuck.
[308:48.67]Oh god.
[308:49.27]Oh fuck.
[308:49.77]The ooze.
[308:56.64]No, I can see it now.
[308:58.20]It's the darker gray on the minimap.
[309:18.46]The ooze approaches.
[309:19.22]I kind of want to go look at it.
[309:21.18]Because I'm done.
[309:24.22]I ate a goon.
[309:24.90]I did everything I needed to do.
[309:26.28]Yeah.
[309:27.84]I kind of want to look at it.
[309:28.76]I'm curious.
[309:36.43]What does it look like?
[309:41.73]Oh, okay.
[309:45.11]It is just creeping.
[309:47.75]Does it kill people?
[309:48.45]Is it going to wipe out this whole bar?
[310:00.09]It's not even going in the bar.
[310:00.93]Oh well.
[310:06.91]It's too dangerous to teleport.
[310:08.17]Why?
[310:14.02]Touch it.
[310:14.36]It's safe.
[310:16.72]Nope.
[310:22.14]Eat a slum dweller.
[310:23.44]That should be pretty easy.
[310:39.69]Oh shit, I'm not hurt.
[310:41.09]No, there we go.
[310:41.47]I'm good.
[310:47.11]What do these power box?
[310:48.17]Shut down the power box?
[310:51.73]Now we gotta eat a couple of cops.
[310:57.40]What a waste of fucking space there.
[311:02.98]Stop it!
[311:03.70]Oh my god, you're killing me.
[311:08.30]No, don't let him... Don't let him... No, I can't eat him if you do that.
[311:32.95]You get more HP if the meat is cooked.
[311:36.56]Right.
[311:38.42]Alright, what is it?
[311:46.03]I need to do... Worker... Okay.
[311:56.82]I didn't mean to do that.
[311:59.87]Well, they'll be cooked now, right?
[312:01.51]Let's test your theory.
[312:03.11]Alright, they're gonna be cooked.
[312:14.28]You actually would not like.
[312:15.54]That's real.
[312:26.68]That's kind of unbelievable.
[312:28.94]Well, little details, huh?
[312:31.44]Alright, let me turn this shit off.
[312:36.07]Turn off the gas and open the doors.
[312:47.08]Neutralize this person.
[313:06.14]Oh, the purple water doesn't heal.
[313:07.78]Cooked meat doesn't heal better.
[313:09.22]How am I supposed to trust you guys?
[313:10.16]You know how many times I've been baited in games like these before?
[313:22.75]I'll take a shotgun.
[313:28.54]Either one of these works for me.
[313:39.53]Alright, let's cook him.
[313:41.93]Never mind.
[313:44.25]I just kind of chopped him up.
[313:47.73]So, uh, operate all the switches.
[314:02.04]Just climb out the damn window.
[314:03.28]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[314:06.86]Ooh.
[314:08.72]Handy.
[314:10.84]This is really handy, actually.
[314:11.98]Look how handy this is.
[314:32.72]We gave you that.
[314:33.60]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[314:36.04]I'm thanking you.
[314:41.07]You guys really helped me here.
[314:43.81]And I much appreciate it.
[314:57.53]Backstabber!
[314:59.57]That's pretty good.
[315:01.12]Or that.
[315:01.42]Any of them.
[315:02.80]I got a lot of money.
[315:03.48]I have to buy some stuff.
[315:14.72]Clone yourself and then eat the clone.
[315:16.72]Didn't they make a movie about that?
[315:19.76]There's a whole movie based around what you're saying.
[315:44.03]Hello?
[315:46.61]Hello?
[315:55.09]I'm here.
[315:55.59]I'm still here.
[315:58.17]Yeah, eat a worker.
[316:04.84]Is that a worker?
[316:05.54]Yes.
[316:13.64]I'm stalking this guy.
[316:19.04]I don't want to do this around anybody, that's why.
[316:26.95]No, he exploded.
[316:27.97]Shit.
[316:36.32]Ow.
[316:36.66]God damn it.
[316:46.51]Broken?
[316:48.97]What, is it all screwed up again?
[316:49.91]Yeah, you should be able to just kind of refresh it.
[317:03.30]That's not a worker.
[317:12.22]Why is there a worker that's in a room that I'm not going to explode accidentally?
[317:20.49]Worker, worker, worker.
[317:21.75]I need a worker.
[317:25.70]Come on.
[317:26.08]I did not mean to blow the last worker up.
[317:37.00]I can't be the only worker here.

[318:23.41]Should be good.
[318:23.97]Did he just steal from the cop?
[318:30.43]Why would you pickpocket a police officer?
[318:32.35]That's probably the dumbest thing you could ever do.
[318:40.77]I still need to eat a worker.
[318:46.09]Shit.
[318:50.94]That's a slum dweller.
[318:53.16]I'm not sure there's another worker on here.
[318:54.42]Do firefighters count as workers?
[319:07.59]Worker!
[319:07.97]Alright.

[324:16.00]I feel like that one's gonna be terrible too.
[324:20.94]Find all the hidden bombs.

[328:55.03]So how does one do this?

[339:59.45]Looks like a South Park character generator.
[340:02.87]Alright, we're good.
[340:06.99]I think we're ready.
[340:12.23]This is the one.
[340:13.61]Why does the super loud guy have a silencer?
[340:17.02]That's a really good question.
[340:18.32]One that I can't answer.
[340:19.34]Why am I so small?
[340:22.24]The guns are bigger than me.
[340:24.34]That's not... That's not good.
[340:25.76]Okay.
[340:27.06]Let's move.
[340:29.42]I need to go down a toilet.
[340:37.26]You can start with 300 bucks for 10 points.
[340:39.54]That's insane.
[340:42.07]I already forget what all the perks were.
[340:50.43]Rescue.
[340:50.81]I'm not gonna fuck with Jax.
[341:01.32]I'm sorry.
[341:03.32]I'm sorry.
[341:04.28]That's not gonna happen.
[341:07.92]Alright, we're gonna try to go through the toilet.
[341:09.28]We're gonna travel like the rats.
[341:15.32]Can't open this.
[341:18.04]Oh no, I can't open it.
[341:19.14]Alright, I gotta kill the guy behind the counter.
[341:22.72]Shopkeeper.
[341:23.24]Did that just ricochet and hit me in the head?
[341:34.87]Alright, you're free.
[341:35.43]Let's go.
[341:35.75]Oh wait.
[341:51.14]This is so stupid.
[342:02.68]It really is a little South Park guy.
[342:12.64]Go on.
[342:13.02]Do I really have to take you all the way to the entrance?
[342:22.49]Flamethrower.
[342:24.13]Good.
[342:27.05]The more range, the better.
[342:29.42]I don't want any melee.
[342:31.02]Zero.
[342:42.02]Yellow to see a toilet.
[342:43.62]I kind of want to try it.
[342:46.40]Can you just hide in the toilets, or do you flush down the toilet and end up in another toilet?
[342:52.55]Alright, this is where we're at.
[343:06.88]Uh, I don't really understand the point of that, but okay.
[343:20.78]There's no secret things to do.
[343:23.56]So we just have to get out.
[343:30.22]Oh, more choice is good.
[343:33.38]That's good.
[343:35.06]That's good.
[343:37.24]That one's good.
[343:46.03]Oh, what is this?
[343:52.06]What just happened?
[343:53.80]Toilet.
[343:56.22]You know where to go.
[344:02.24]See you later, sucker!
[344:06.70]This is stupid.
[344:07.50]Aw, I broke the toilet.
[344:18.85]Don't ever run away from GEMS!
[344:24.11]I was going to go eat that guy.
[344:29.62]Neutralize.
[344:30.32]You got it.
[344:35.16]Jax.
[344:43.80]Break out of prison.
[344:45.57]You got it.
[344:47.73]Yeah, Jax.
[345:17.11]Where's your computer?
[345:19.87]Where is your computer?
[345:39.24]Checks lens every fucking shot, dude.
[345:41.24]I'm telling you.
[345:50.46]Alright, let me open this.
[345:56.02]Out.
[345:57.02]To the entrance.
[345:58.28]All the way to the end.
[345:59.66]All the way.
[346:00.64]All the way down.
[346:01.58]The whole way.
[346:02.22]I'm fast.
[346:15.74]I didn't realize I was this fast.
[346:18.19]Teleport.
[346:18.85]Ooh.
[346:20.21]Wrong way.
[346:21.33]Wrong way.
[346:21.93]Right.
[346:22.17]I'm stupid.
[346:23.91]There's still a way for him, though.
[346:24.79]I can't teleport with him.
[346:29.84]Done.
[346:38.56]I'm supposed to be able to use the teleport in the toilet to go to a different toilet, but maybe there's only one toilet.
[346:46.05]That makes sense.
[346:54.59]Yeah, no melee.
[346:55.57]The Jax is not going to use melee.
[346:56.65]I have like one or two points in it.
[347:05.52]The Vulture is good because I can probably get a machine gun.
[347:11.58]Done.
[347:13.88]Going pretty fast.
[347:15.82]Just give me some good perks and we're good.
[347:19.99]Oh, this is bad.
[347:22.88]I'll take one.
[347:24.34]The other ones are awful.
[347:32.85]I take more damage.
[347:34.41]And I think I deal less damage, right?
[347:35.83]Because I'm small.
[347:38.33]In the game.
[347:46.06]Riot.
[347:46.56]Riot.
[347:47.16]We have to riot.
[347:48.04]It's time to riot.
[347:50.14]Riot.
[347:55.82]Well, that's fine.
[347:56.96]I'm just gonna move as fast as I fucking can.
[348:02.88]Up and up.
[348:11.65]Ooh, that's the accuracy one.
[348:15.25]Who's up there?
[348:15.85]Hello, how are ya?
[348:16.77]Nice to meet ya.
[348:19.05]You don't fucking miss.
[348:36.70]Oh, I just shot a gorilla.
[348:39.67]Alright, give me a... Give me the shurikens.
[348:48.65]I can...
[349:03.77]No, no, this thing sucks.
[349:04.71]This thing.
[349:05.99]The leak bug is terrible.
[349:14.03]It has one or two very specific use cases.
[349:19.68]I want nothing to do with that.
[349:20.58]Alright, what do we got?
[349:21.24]Uh, rescue.
[349:22.20]It's so small, it's easy to get through.
[349:33.15]Is there a point where I can break through?
[349:36.29]What?
[349:36.47]Oh, let's go.
[349:39.81]No, no, no, no, no.
[349:40.29]Get in here.
[349:41.02]Stop fighting.
[349:41.58]Stop fighting.
[349:41.96]Stop fighting.
[349:42.70]I got to make these count.
[349:46.34]Thank God.
[349:46.68]Out of my way.
[350:04.95]Looking buff today, I know.
[350:08.49]I ate a full breakfast this morning, and then I turned on the stream right now.
[350:12.63]Check this out.
[350:32.12]There it is.
[350:34.74]Give me the mini fridge.
[350:41.48]I'm not gonna utilize this.
[350:42.90]Mini fridge.
[350:44.62]Not the cardboard box.
[350:45.60]Mini fridge.
[350:46.24]I need the food.
[350:46.98]I need to get food and eat it.
[350:50.92]I'm not gonna even activate this.
[350:53.00]I'm in full Jex mode, which means I'm shooting and running around and dodging and I'm not gonna use that.
[351:00.12]You're killing my run.
[351:12.66]Use that fridge.
[351:16.66]Destroy that.
[351:18.38]Got it.
[351:21.36]Yep.
[351:28.66]This is lame.
[351:29.34]And what do you know?
[351:34.24]Check this out.
[351:42.81]That took way too many shots.
[351:44.31]I don't know why it took that many.
[352:00.90]It's not a gun.
[352:01.68]It's not a gun.
[352:02.18]Jax is not good without a gun.
[352:06.08]It's not a gun.
[352:19.74]Ooh, he was waiting for me.
[352:21.24]There's so many cops out here.
[352:23.95]I need a toilet.
[352:32.79]I need a toilet bad.
[352:33.67]Okay, give me a toilet.
[352:37.58]Toilet, toilet, toilet.
[352:38.40]Quick, quick, quick.
[352:38.92]Hurry up.

[353:11.82]I'll take it.
[353:20.65]Shut up.
[353:20.87]Just give me what's in the chest.
[353:31.35]A whole lot of nothing.
[353:35.51]Take the drugs.
[353:36.19]The drugs always suck.
[353:37.75]I've never taken drugs and it's done anything good.
[353:40.79]Except for that time.
[353:42.27]Not that time.
[353:43.73]And I took the sulfuric acid.
[353:44.99]Okay, I have like five things going on.
[353:46.41]I'm like on so many drugs.
[353:48.09]I'm double confused.

[354:03.70]It's impossible.
[354:09.44]Talking about real life.

[356:33.46]He resurrected!

[359:24.03]These two are good.
[359:35.05]Good choice.
[359:37.09]Excellent choice, guys.
[359:49.56]Alright, we know this one's dumb.
[359:51.70]This is just like a speedrun.
[359:54.00]Bombs falling from the sky and radiation rains down upon all outdoor areas every 20 seconds.
[360:00.62]Bombs or radiation?
[360:12.96]Bombs?
[360:13.65]It's gonna be close.
[360:14.25]Bombs.
[360:18.99]Do they telegraph or do I have to just avoid them?
[360:20.79]I have no idea.
[360:27.20]Bombs are dropping.
[360:28.16]Look up.
[360:35.18]Oh my god.
[360:41.11]This is gonna be horrible.
[360:42.21]Alright, well, actually, this actually might be good because I'll get everything for free.
[360:47.34]Don't group up where the bomb dropped.
[360:50.92]Drop them over here so I can get the safe.
[361:16.63]Oh, fuck!
[361:18.23]Neutralized!
[361:19.27]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[361:28.80]Safe.
[361:31.34]Okay.
[361:36.55]No, no, no, that's not worth it.
[361:37.81]I have to just neutralize this guy.
[361:40.47]Where is it?
[361:40.83]Give me the pistol.
[361:43.31]Up here.
[361:44.35]Jesus.
[361:54.69]Got it.
[361:58.46]Give me the freeze ray.
[361:59.74]Freeze ray.
[362:00.10]Freeze, freeze, freeze.
[362:06.31]No, no, no mini fridge.
[362:07.31]It's not gonna... Mini fridge is good, but I want the freeze ray, because it freezes people and then they get hit by the bombs.
[362:18.38]No, no, don't give me the mini fridge.
[362:19.32]I want the freeze ray.
[362:21.74]I don't want the mini fridge.
[362:31.72]Ah!
[362:35.27]I don't have any food for this to work.
[362:36.67]Alright, what's left?
[362:39.73]Destroy that.
[362:40.33]I'm just going to have a bomb drop on it.
[362:41.99]Holy shit.
[362:43.49]Whiskey, give that to me.
[362:47.57]Um... Should I... No, let's do dispensive.
[362:52.41]No, I don't want any of this.
[362:53.55]Alright, I know where the bombs drop.
[362:57.29]Where it lights up.
[362:59.41]I want that safe, though.
[363:00.63]Just drop the bomb on this guy right here.
[363:05.49]Right here.
[363:12.52]Oh fuck it, whatever, let's go.
[363:17.24]I'm just running from the bombs.
[363:18.84]Who's that is a bomb?
[363:22.30]Alright, right here.
[363:23.58]Drop one right here.
[363:24.64]And then let me get out.
[363:26.53]Here it comes.
[363:27.87]Come on.
[363:30.35]Will that do it?
[363:36.38]Come on, drop one over here so I don't have to go in that.
[363:40.73]This guy's dead.
[363:48.84]Do it!
[363:51.60]Is it gonna land?
[363:53.82]Do it right here.
[364:17.11]Hey!
[364:19.45]Dude, it's fucking chaos outside and you're gonna act like this right- Actual chaos outside.
[364:26.83]Are you stupid?
[364:30.35]Oh god.
[364:34.45]Thank you.
[364:42.98]Elevator open.
[364:43.72]I need health.
[364:47.42]That's it, right?
[364:48.12]Alright, get me out of this bomb nonsense.
[364:53.53]Turn on Twitch integration?
[364:55.71]Um... It's been on for, like, two hours.
[365:00.85]What?
[365:04.73]Okay.
[365:06.47]Random item?
[365:11.66]Yeah, it's been on for, like, a couple hours.
[365:16.24]I don't want to talk to you.
[365:18.10]Yes, you do.
[365:20.63]What is that?
[365:21.23]Bracelet of Strength.
[365:23.09]Probably belongs in a much more medieval fantasy-oriented game, but who cares?
[365:26.25]Increases your melee strength.
[365:27.29]Give me, like, the big heal.
[365:40.08]Water Pump?
[365:46.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[365:47.29]Is this a heal?
[365:48.73]No, it's not a heal.
[365:56.21]Is it electrified?
[365:57.19]The water is electrified now.
[366:04.50]Is it though?
[366:10.18]I just poisoned it.
[366:15.50]Oh, it gives me Electro Touch.
[366:27.72]Okay.
[366:28.46]Well, that's an Electro Touch forever.
[366:29.88]Can I Electro... Get rid of these.
[366:35.07]Do they die?
[366:40.35]Ooh, yeah, they do.
[366:45.74]is that okay nice turns almost any item into food food that probably causes cancer but that's beyond the game scope wait what I can can I put the shuriken in there
[367:22.39]Oh, turning it into the FUD.
[367:29.02]Any more melee shit?
[367:33.75]No, that's good for now.
[367:42.49]I wanted to eat the FUD, but it ate the first aid kit, and I'm about to level up.
[367:47.65]You have no idea just how badly I wish I could save state like 10 seconds ago.
[368:09.78]Hey!
[368:13.46]Ooh, I got a friend phone.
[368:17.36]I'm just gonna sell it.
[368:19.12]Nobody likes me.
[368:27.46]$3.
[368:27.72]What a waste.
[368:30.23]What a serious waste.
[368:31.09]Like, why would I... You gotta put at least, like, $5, $10 in those chests.
[368:36.51]Come on.
[368:39.75]Why am I hurting?
[368:44.44]What the... Alright, is there a cell-o-matic?
[368:50.26]Yeah, there is.
[368:50.60]Alright, get rid of the... I don't want this.
[369:00.49]It's confused.
[369:01.19]It's terrible.
[369:01.95]Melee.
[369:02.33]Get rid of the banana peels.
[369:04.17]They didn't do anything.
[369:06.15]Get rid of the...
[369:11.15]Uh, the phone.
[369:13.25]Twice.
[369:14.91]Nobody, I don't have any friends.
[369:18.49]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[369:20.65]Can I buy anything else?
[369:23.36]Axe is melee?
[369:24.02]Yeah, but this could be desperate.
[369:25.30]An incredibly desperate attempt.
[369:26.72]For me to just run around.
[369:28.10]Axe is really powerful.
[369:30.08]Powerful.
[369:32.04]Yeah, the axe is really powerful.
[369:34.40]God.
[369:36.65]Can I, like, talk?
[369:41.07]So we got, um... I don't want any of that stuff.
[369:44.14]Alright, I'm good to go.
[369:45.74]Just destroy the box.
[369:50.26]Is there an ammo container anymore?
[369:54.92]No, just a bartender.
[370:01.34]See what I mean?
[370:01.72]I don't even know what happened.
[370:03.35]I just knew that I need this axe now.
[370:05.49]Because everyone's coming after me.
[370:19.31]That dude had 10 bucks.
[370:20.97]Alright.
[370:22.75]Load automatic here.
[370:27.69]I don't even have the silencer equipped.
[370:29.89]Well, so hold on.
[370:31.36]Let me do that real quick.
[370:34.52]And then... I don't understand.
[370:37.84]What does the ATM do?
[370:38.86]Oh, it can be stored between runs.
[370:41.84]I get it.
[370:42.22]Okay.
[370:43.08]So what's the point of me doing this just to get 76 bucks for another gun?
[370:59.37]Just ammo?
[371:00.69]That's a lot of money for ammo though.
[371:04.39]Yeah, it's not worth it.
[371:05.09]Alright, let's do this.
[371:12.50]I'm gonna have to use the axe.
[371:13.42]This is why I kept it.
[371:20.17]Right into the water.
[371:28.44]It's better if you start the game with rare items because it puts those in there.
[371:31.64]I see.
[371:32.48]Cool.
[371:38.71]None of these are very good for what I'm doing right now.
[371:41.53]Unfortunately.
[371:49.32]I'll be happy if I get down to the one after this.
[371:55.67]Yeah, Leap Blower would be actually kind of good here.
[371:58.01]Just blow people into the water.
[372:02.39]Thank you.
[372:03.43]And it's technically a gun, so... You are correct.
[372:07.52]It is a gun, technically.
[372:09.96]Not like anybody was arguing with me about it.
[372:15.04]Ah, you know, you're right.
[372:16.20]You're right.
[372:17.06]Yeah, who's right?
[372:17.92]What are you talking about?
[372:19.01]Get away from me.
[372:28.09]Cocktail, whiskey.
[372:29.49]I should buy some of these.
[372:35.33]No, don't want that.
[372:37.55]Thank you.
[372:40.27]Resurrection!
[372:43.20]Does that last until I die?
[372:44.54]Because that's a huge deal.
[372:50.90]Holy shit.
[372:53.90]I'm done with all the missions.
[372:54.64]I'm just going to get out.
[372:57.44]Walk him into the trap.
[372:59.08]He avoided it.
[373:01.39]Okay, good.
[373:04.19]Goodbye.
[373:04.89]There's an ammo thing right there.
[373:06.35]No!
[373:08.75]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[373:09.67]Alright, stop.
[373:15.44]Okay, get out, get out, get out.
[373:16.46]Okay, alright, alright.
[373:31.78]Ah, this is good.
[373:32.84]This is good.
[373:38.78]Was this 3-2 coming up?
[373:41.17]3-3?
[373:47.91]Something like that, right?
[373:51.67]Yeah, extra experience is always good.
[373:52.89]That means a full health.
[373:56.84]I said that with an English accent.
[373:59.70]Or like a Scottish accent for some reason.
[374:02.28]Oh, it's a full health.
[374:05.74]I don't know.
[374:06.35]Sometimes my brain just turns off.
[374:08.19]Selling that.
[374:13.01]Alright, right in there.
[374:15.47]Destroy that.
[374:16.13]I should be... Yeah, watch this.
[374:23.05]That's a huge...
[374:34.56]60 bucks.
[374:35.30]You get a lot of money.
[374:36.60]Wait, where is it?
[374:37.96]Where is it?
[374:40.38]That was clearly 60, wasn't it?
[374:54.95]I did not know you had to equip those.
[374:59.86]Resist bullets or resist damage.
[375:01.68]What is the difference?
[375:02.86]Resist bullets.
[375:08.93]Let's go.
[375:16.47]Neutralize some folks and then retrieve the chest.
[375:19.41]Okay.
[375:20.09]Wait.
[375:20.61]He doesn't like me, but I don't have any more of that stuff, do I?
[375:24.23]Oh, well.
[375:26.89]Oh, well.
[375:29.03]I walked right into that.
[375:29.89]I saw it coming from a mile away.
[375:31.55]I knew it.
[375:32.05]I was staring at it.
[375:33.49]I just walked into it.
[375:38.00]Back up.
[375:54.02]Huh?
[376:01.30]That scared the shit out of me.
[376:02.80]Did he... He bumped into me?
[376:04.64]Or something?
[376:05.06]69.
[376:10.25]I need some ammo for...
[376:24.81]The shotgun.
[376:28.58]I needed to do it.
[376:29.22]I still have resurrection, so that's good.
[376:38.06]Nice, dude.
[376:38.86]Can I give him a flamethrower?
[376:44.12]No.
[376:44.70]How do I approach this?
[376:46.62]I have to just shoot him.
[377:05.36]I'm gonna take the critter upper.
[377:12.56]Yeah.
[377:24.19]It was worth it.
[377:29.87]That one, that one, that one, that one.
[377:33.28]Or the grenade.
[377:34.44]Both will work.
[377:49.95]Good, good, good, good.
[377:51.57]Thank you.
[377:53.43]Thank you, all of you.
[377:56.03]Doing a good thing.
[378:01.13]Three, you fools.
[378:03.71]No, one.
[378:08.62]Alright.
[378:09.82]Getting there.
[378:11.34]Annoyed.
[378:11.76]Wait, can I just...
[378:26.42]I didn't start it, but I finished it.
[378:28.08]Here comes the run killer, again.
[378:39.51]It actually has been 3 for 3, even if I didn't die to the robot.
[378:43.25]The robot's presence causes me to panic every single time.
[378:47.28]I gotta get over it with Jax, though.

[379:29.58]Get the fuck away from me.

[409:15.25]I'm never gonna get over the robot.
[409:17.79]Alright.
[409:24.58]No, no, that's it, that's it.
[409:25.70]We've been going for seven hours.
[409:35.60]So tomorrow, I'll see you for the comm stream.
[409:39.80]I said fall song.
[409:40.64]I didn't say fall song.
[409:41.48]I said I was going to do it for like 12 seconds.
[409:45.43]Yeah, it got late.
[409:47.13]Thanks for staying.
[409:47.55]This game's fun.
[409:50.97]I would play this one again.
[409:53.31]If you enjoyed it.
[409:55.15]But, I mean... Checking it out.
[409:58.83]First impressions with Jerma985.
[410:00.38]It's pretty fun.
[410:04.97]Seems like you can dump at least 20 to 40 hours into this game.
[410:11.73]Pretty cool.
[410:13.23]But yeah, tomorrow we're going to do a calm stream.
[410:14.39]We're going to do more tier lists.
[410:17.09]I'm going to lip sync the entire Mambo No.
[410:19.45]5 song from start to finish.
[410:26.19]And we'll do some flash game.
[410:27.15]We'll just hang out.
[410:28.67]It's like a whatever stream.
[410:30.62]Should be fun.
[410:33.15]Uh, the internet still seems to be an issue, but at least I don't have five VODs this time.
[410:40.07]Because before they fixed one of the, there's probably two or three different problems, but we dropped 20,000 frames in seven hours, which is just barely at that level of tolerable.
[410:58.05]Anything over like 1% drop frames would be mm-mm.
[411:05.34]Let's hope it improves as we continue to go over the next few days.
[411:12.26]It was good.
[411:12.72]It was alright.
[411:16.03]Don't listen to this deepfake promising us things.
[411:21.01]Alright, let's, uh... Let's call it.
[411:26.21]That's a perfect time to stop, I think.
[411:27.47]Starting a new run would be like another 40, 50 minutes in.
[411:29.45]It's getting late.
[411:36.28]So let's go back earlier.
[411:37.36]Let's do the bits.
[411:40.60]And we had $2.50 from Mueldo.
[411:44.57]Hey Jerma, I'd be surprised if no one has suggested this yet, but you should definitely contact Michael Reeves and William Osmond to help with your carnival stream alongside the robotics team.
[411:56.28]If you haven't heard of them, look them up on YouTube.
[412:00.58]Unfortunately, this robotics stream, there are two different companies that are involved.
[412:08.11]One of them is handling the actual engineering and building of the robots, and the other one is handling the stream stuff.
[412:16.32]I mean, I'm like the grand overseer or whatever.
[412:20.56]I'm like the executive producer, I guess you could say.
[412:24.15]But there's a couple of teams that are working underneath essentially everything that I've said I wanted to do.
[412:30.55]So I really already have a whole company and a whole team of people who are going to be doing, like, the stream portion.
[412:38.68]And I don't think I have the necessary resources to contact anybody else or have anybody else come on board or... There's a lot of moving parts.
[412:50.54]How can you afford all this?
[412:52.74]Uh...
[412:57.67]I kind of just don't give a fuck about all that.
[413:04.56]I'm doing just fine.
[413:06.46]You know what I mean?
[413:14.68]I... the money that I make and the money that I put into this stream, I would rather put a shitload of money into a stream and still be doing just fine.
[413:23.57]Which I will be.
[413:25.27]So don't worry about my monetary and my financials, because I've ran the numbers a bunch of times, I'm saving a lot of money, so don't worry.
[413:35.60]But I really don't care about trying to maximize my profits on Twitch.
[413:42.16]If it means that I get to potentially do and stream one of the most interesting things I think I've at least personally ever done on camera, then I want to do it.
[413:53.47]Like, it's worth it to me to be able to do something like that and try.
[413:58.09]So.
[414:02.27]Tingy, thanks for the 10 community subs right at the end here.
[414:04.39]Thank you so much, Tingy.
[414:07.67]That's where you get your money.
[414:10.09]That 10 community subs just came in.
[414:13.85]But if I'm able to do this, look, I want to look back in 10, 20 years.
[414:18.27]When I'm done with this, maybe, altogether, I'll be like, I don't know, I'll be like fucking 50, guys.
[414:23.35]I'll be like 60 years old.
[414:26.03]I personally want to just be like, hey, remember when I did that?
[414:28.77]And yeah, it costed some money, but it was worth it.
[414:32.09]It was a lot of fun.
[414:33.57]And it was a big, like, community fun event.
[414:35.88]I don't care about trying to, well, you know, hold on, I can, like, keep that, buddy.
[414:43.33]No, it's worth doing this.
[414:44.31]It'll be fun.
[414:44.73]I remember when I spent two dollars... I remember when I spent a two dollar bill on that carnival.
[415:01.39]Another 30 years.
[415:02.89]I don't know about that.
[415:08.79]A two... No, not two billion.
[415:12.66]Don't ever stop streaming for the rest of your life.
[415:19.31]I don't have any immediate plans.
[415:21.17]But I don't know if I'm going to be the 55-year-old, 60-year-old guy on here.
[415:33.70]Why not?
[415:35.24]I want to retire somewhere.
[415:39.08]I have no idea how long I'll be doing this.
[415:42.75]I don't have any plan or any goals with this.
[415:48.16]I'm just gonna keep doing it until I don't think it's fun anymore.
[415:52.91]That could be 50 years.
[415:56.55]It might not be.
[415:57.79]I don't know.
[416:06.86]I'll cry if you retire.
[416:09.12]By the time that I stop streaming, or really, really, really dial back completely... It'll... It's gonna be a while from now.
[416:30.96]Alright, this is a very normal thing.
[416:37.90]Hold on, so me telling you guys, you know, you might get, you know, there might be 20 more years of this.
[416:44.86]No!
[416:46.64]Well, think of it this way, right?
[416:47.78]How long does your favorite TV show run for?
[416:51.50]I'm of the opinion, and I truly believe this, that there's a time to end the TV show.
[416:59.57]Because all the TV shows that go on for more than like 10 to 20 seasons, they start to lose why they were interesting in the first place, I think.
[417:20.46]After like the 9 to 15 seasons, it might be time to wrap it up.
[417:30.64]20 seasons now Twitch is a lot different than television but you know the same I actually was having this conversation with Etalyx the other day and we were talking about this okay so Twitch right what what happens when you play every game you know it's like a fossil fuel when you do everything what happens when you do everything like 10 years from now you've played every game every game that's worth playing
[418:02.88]We just have to wait for the new ones?
[418:07.13]They make new ones.
[418:08.51]Yeah, but I'm just saying, like, what happens when you do everything?
[418:15.03]Prepare for more IRL.
[418:16.35]Yeah, but I already told you guys, I'm not gonna do IRL streams, unless they're... ...bits.
[418:29.83]I'm not walking around with the selfie camera out of, like, the subway and be like, Hey, saw a guy that had, like, the subway doors, like, closed on the fucking selfie stick.
[418:36.89]Like, oh, shit!
[418:38.36]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, stop the train!
[418:39.74]Stop the train!
[418:40.44]I'm not doing that.
[418:46.30]You're doing an IRL stream tomorrow.
[418:49.63]Yeah, but it's different, because I don't do it that often.
[418:54.91]And there's nothing wrong with that.
[418:55.91]I've nothing wrong with an IRL stream, I'm just saying.
[418:58.01]I don't want to do that.
[418:59.13]I don't want to every day, like, walk around Vegas.
[419:03.59]I don't want to do that.
[419:05.55]I'd rather do something else.
[419:13.72]Let me comb my hair on stream.
[419:16.90]Yeah, when was the last comb stream?
[419:21.61]Two years ago?
[419:22.41]A year and a half ago?
[419:27.09]It was a year ago that I combed my hair on stream and just hung out.
[419:33.97]So, come on.
[419:42.41]Is this the guy who sang Mambo No.
[419:44.39]5 into his comb like it was a microphone?
[419:47.37]Yes.
[419:50.29]But long story short, don't worry about my financials.
[419:57.65]We might fuck around here a lot, but I'm going to make sure that I'm not going to cause myself any problems.
[420:01.95]It's not going to be an issue.
[420:03.17]I'm going to be just fine.
[420:05.37]So don't worry.
[420:06.73]I appreciate the concern, though.
[420:08.81]I'm looking forward to it.
[420:09.45]It'll be fine.
[420:11.04]But let's keep going with the bits.
[420:14.52]Stop dropping coins.
[420:15.60]I'm doing that.
[420:16.40]Okay, that's subconscious.
[420:17.34]I'm just picking coins up off the... Because they were a mess.
[420:22.17]I did this, I did this little, like, uh, thing where, uh, Joel called me after vine wrestle, and I pretended... Never mind.
[420:30.55]Because that's a spoiler.
[420:31.61]Like, I was cheating, but I had, like, rolls of coins in my hands.
[420:35.95]That's a spoiler.
[420:36.79]We're not gonna do spoilers here.
[420:41.77]Let's count his money.
[420:42.51]We got one, two, three.
[420:45.05]That's a dollar right there?
[420:47.98]Anyways, uh, thank you to lewd sheep for the three bucks.
[420:50.55]Hey, Jermbo, this message is so that you notice a creative person called Yenwen Len who made great art.
[420:57.19]Uh, find their message if you can.
[420:59.73]Or did.
[421:00.99]And ignore this once you do.
[421:02.77]Yeah, we put, uh, Yenwen has insane, incredible art.
[421:06.15]We put Yenwen's art up on the screen pretty much any chance we get.
[421:10.65]It's... It's incredibly detailed.
[421:13.33]It's perfect.
[421:14.21]It's fantastic.
[421:16.13]And there's not much else I can say that's more than that.
[421:19.61]So, we usually check it out every time.
[421:23.58]And I'm sure we'll probably come across it if it's here.
[421:29.42]But thank you, Loot Sheep.
[421:31.56]Trotter, thanks for the $2.50.
[421:32.74]Hey, Jermaine, just got my one-year sub badge and I wanted to say thanks for all the good times.
[421:36.80]I know it's cheesy and you get it all the time, but really, thank you.
[421:40.25]I'm extremely excited for the future.
[421:42.31]Jermaine, so am I.
[421:46.36]There are a lot of interesting things to look forward to.
[421:55.25]I really appreciate the support.
[421:56.23]Thanks for being around for that long.
[421:57.21]Thanks for being subbed for a year.
[422:00.15]That's 12 straight months that you have decided that I am worth your $5 a month.
[422:06.71]Or more, considering whatever potential tier.
[422:10.97]Thank you.
[422:14.26]And that goes to all of you.
[422:17.88]Thank you, Abomination0, for the five dolls and ten cents.
[422:20.14]Jerma, I need your help with a magic trick.
[422:21.84]Can you act like you're playing and then show yourself holding up the three of clubs and say, is this your card?
[422:33.85]Uh, yeah.
[422:35.81]Okay.
[422:41.13]Watch out, watch out.
[422:43.67]Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.
[422:45.73]Got him.
[422:49.29]Is this your card?
[422:53.55]It's no.
[422:54.97]Apparently not.
[423:03.77]There you go.
[423:04.45]Whatever you want to do with it.
[423:05.49]Go ahead.
[423:10.02]Thank you for the $5.10.
[423:11.18]Thank you, the Lemonade Parade, for the $10.
[423:13.48]Oh, wait a minute here.
[423:16.50]Hold on.
[423:18.19]Thank you for the 10 bucks, first of all.
[423:19.43]And second of all, tried the tuna and pretzel thing you said to try, and it changed my life.
[423:29.05]I knew somebody.
[423:29.93]I knew it.
[423:31.53]All you had to do was taste it and realize.
[423:34.49]I hope more of you do that.
[423:39.42]Tuna?
[423:39.92]I'm talking tuna, like, from the can.
[423:42.50]With mayonnaise whipped up.
[423:44.32]Crushed up.
[423:44.98]Like it's gonna go in a sandwich.
[423:45.96]Don't put it in a sandwich.
[423:47.34]Get pretzel sticks or regular pretzels.
[423:49.02]Doesn't matter.
[423:49.36]Crispy ones.
[423:50.40]And slide it.
[423:51.38]Smear it on the... With the tuna.
[423:53.54]Eat it.
[423:54.60]Trust me.
[423:56.80]Do it.
[423:57.94]Do it.
[423:58.26]I don't care if you try it once and then you hate it.
[424:01.20]Come tell me you hated it.
[424:03.66]Because we got the lemonade parade.
[424:06.02]Just said that it was amazing.
[424:10.36]And that's one.
[424:12.22]There were like 4,800 people on that stream.
[424:14.34]So one out of 5,000 is... Okay.
[424:17.16]That's not a very good number.
[424:18.18]But still.
[424:19.24]Nobody came here and said it was bad.
[424:27.87]Thank you, FraudianWeapon, for the $2.50.
[424:29.07]Hey, Jerm, congrats on your Vine Wrestle participation.
[424:33.77]That's right.
[424:34.60]I was in it.
[424:35.30]It was a lot of fun.
[424:36.46]We're not going to do any spoilers.
[424:37.38]Because there are people that may not have seen it yet.
[424:40.92]They want to watch it.
[424:41.52]So, thank you.
[424:45.29]It was... I'm honored that I was even considered to be part of it in the first place.
[424:52.75]Redacted.
[424:56.48]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $250.
[424:57.94]Gnarly, $62.
[424:58.42]In 87, Huey released this.
[425:01.66]Four.
[425:02.64]It's one of the most accomplished albums.
[425:06.24]Yes, it is.
[425:11.62]I have not seen that movie in a long time.
[425:17.15]I remember it being a very good movie, though.
[425:21.21]That was when Christian Bale was really starting to kind of become an A-list actor, right?
[425:30.14]We have $2.50 from Snooze.
[425:31.94]And Snooze says...
[425:38.23]And here it is.
[425:38.55]I love how Shido has legs.
[425:39.11]Shido is a scorpion.
[425:57.23]That's very cute.
[425:58.37]Anyways, your streams are such genuine positive points in my week.
[426:01.27]And although I can't give back a lot, please know how much they mean to me and so many others.
[426:05.69]Thank you, and buy rights.
[426:08.13]Buy sexual pride.
[426:10.69]Thank you so much, News.
[426:16.14]I am forever, forever grateful that people think that this stuff that happens on this stream is worth drawing attention to.
[426:25.02]fan art for, or community art for.
[426:31.24]Sometimes I can't believe it, and it... Every day I'm just like, is this like, really, is this like, really happening?
[426:39.84]Is this, this community's real, right?
[426:42.22]I didn't just like, have a bunch of, uh, uh, this is real.
[426:47.60]No, sometimes I can't believe it, and it means a lot.
[426:53.97]Thank you everybody that contributes all the time to this channel.
[426:58.70]You make it what it is.
[427:08.06]Wear bots.
[427:10.75]I don't believe that.
[427:16.93]Am I a deepfake?
[427:19.01]I don't know.
[427:20.39]I don't think so.
[427:22.97]This whole stream could have been a deepfake and you would never know.
[427:25.57]But Snooze, that's very, very, very awesome stuff.
[427:29.35]Thank you for the art.
[427:31.89]I'm kind of realizing that Cheeto and Fireman could be... related somehow.
[427:39.15]Somewhere down the road.
[427:41.59]But thank you for that.
[427:44.17]A whole of one zombie, thanks for the $5.
[427:45.57]I'm not sure if you heard or seen of AI portraits, but it made you into a Joker-type villain.
[428:08.33]This shit is fucking freaky.
[428:11.27]It also made one less creepy.
[428:14.03]Less creepy.
[428:24.09]By less creepy, you mean somehow more creepy.
[428:33.40]Who comes up with this shit?
[428:38.26]How do you even make a program that's capable of doing that?
[428:44.45]It's the eyes.
[428:45.01]The eyes are freaking me out.
[428:45.87]Yeah, I don't know what it is about the eyes.
[428:56.91]One of them's, like, off.
[428:59.71]Do my eyes look like that?
[429:04.15]But thank you, Holo1Zombie.
[429:06.25]Hey, Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.
[429:09.45]In the past 5 months, your streams have been... There have been 4.6 million messages in your chat, 43,912 unique users chatting, and 10,387 unique emotes used.
[429:19.38]Just some numbers that I happened to come across.
[429:23.18]That's a lot.
[429:23.52]4.6 million messages.
[429:24.04]That's almost 5 million.
[429:39.49]That's almost a million messages a month.
[429:43.69]All me on other accounts.
[429:48.63]You got a lot of accounts then.
[429:52.37]Interesting data.
[429:53.07]Thank you, LazyLoop.
[430:03.40]Thank you, StifunkyChicken, or StifunkyChicken.
[430:08.44]Thank you.
[430:10.77]You mentioned you had an idea for setting aside stream time for your videos.
[430:14.59]Yes.
[430:15.57]The stream ended before you could finish the thought.
[430:17.33]Right, right.
[430:17.71]That's right.
[430:18.03]I forgot about that.
[430:21.39]I was seconds away from talking about how I wanted to start to do a thing.
[430:25.79]And the internet turned off.
[430:32.25]So let me actually go over that real quickly.
[430:35.60]Because so many people give so much interesting stuff on these streams, I would rather set up like once or twice a month a community video night, community art night, kind of bunch them all together so we can do them all.
[430:55.06]Because it seems like every couple streams, there's like another video that somebody spent a lot of time on.
[430:59.54]There's some artwork that people have submitted into the creative channel and the Discord.
[431:06.13]I think that maybe once or twice a month, doing a... Hey, look!
[431:11.24]There's like five or six videos and like 12 pieces of artwork.
[431:16.38]And just for like an hour or so, either before or after a stream, just go over it.
[431:21.40]And...
[431:23.10]Especially, especially the video stuff.
[431:27.22]Because it really feels like, oh, hey, Jerma, here's a video.
[431:29.80]Let's put it on right now.
[431:31.72]And maybe there's not as many people here.
[431:33.65]They maybe would want to see it too.
[431:34.97]And if they knew that it was, oh, he's going to do video stuff, then maybe they would stick around for it.
[431:41.55]But that's what I was going to talk about before.
[431:45.89]But in case, let me see.
[431:47.63]I want to see Yen Wen...
[431:55.17]I have some art links.
[431:56.37]Let me make sure that I can get these open.
[432:02.84]Oh, I can't wait to see this.
[432:05.70]Yeah, I got the links now.
[432:12.19]Oh man, this is awesome.
[432:18.59]This is fucking awesome.
[432:25.43]Alright, let me get these on the screen, because these are great.
[432:30.03]Let's see, this is gonna be probably really high resolution, see if we can get it on here.
[432:34.27]This is, uh, what Yen Wend says, what they imagine the carnival stream, what I would look like on the carnival stream.
[432:42.00]And, you know, you... You might be, you might be pretty close.
[432:56.09]Let's get it on there, man.
[432:56.91]Is it going in the right place?
[432:59.47]Is it going in the right place?
[433:02.15]Where's it going?
[433:05.09]I need to have, like, a better system for this, too.
[433:13.44]Because my files are, like, all over the place.
[433:17.64]Is my Windows crashing right now?
[433:22.72]What are you doing?
[433:28.18]Here we go, ready?
[433:40.51]Let's get a good view of this.
[433:49.59]You might be onto something here.
[433:54.51]Let's get right into the face.
[434:01.93]The eyebrows are the best.
[434:11.75]I can't wait to do that stream.
[434:15.84]I want nothing more than to have that done.
[434:18.28]Now.
[434:20.54]All in due time, it'll be worth the wait.
[434:22.32]And then here's another one.
[434:24.66]It's called Jerma Base Face.
[434:28.31]Which is the start of it.
[434:29.83]This is kind of what I would look like without the...
[434:34.26]makeup on I don't know how some of you I don't know how some of you guys get this detail it's so good thank you so much for these yeah man they're awesome as always
[435:03.72]You see what I mean?
[435:04.28]Like, I want... This is... Doing this, like, once every month or so would be great.
[435:12.08]With videos.
[435:13.04]Or other... It doesn't have to be just art.
[435:14.71]Or just videos.
[435:15.19]It could be anything.
[435:20.27]But those are fantastic.
[435:21.19]Thank you so much.
[435:24.05]So much time, so much energy, and so much effort went into those.
[435:27.49]And all the other art that I get.
[435:29.86]And videos.
[435:31.08]Some of you guys spend weeks on shit.
[435:32.94]And I wish there was more I could say.
[435:36.58]Some of you guys are so talented.
[435:37.99]Thank you so much for this fucking incredible stuff.
[435:40.79]Damn.
[435:49.40]Jerma's Nux, thanks for the $5.
[435:51.14]Get baited, nerd.
[435:51.96]Bet you won't say my name.
[435:53.03]That's why I said it, because I want to prove that I would.
[435:55.41]Thanks for the $5.
[435:56.13]S. Wid Harry, thanks for the $5.
[436:02.83]I've been a fan since the TC Hydro Time Machine video and I wanted to say thanks for everything you have ever made.
[436:08.25]I've loved almost all of it.
[436:09.93]I'm going to be going to the fighting game tournament EVO next week to compete in Smash Ultimate and Samurai Shodown.
[436:16.44]Getting pretty nervous and excited, so wish me luck and thank you.
[436:20.24]EVO is next week, isn't it?
[436:22.54]And it's in Vegas.
[436:26.50]I gotta get down there.
[436:27.64]I gotta get down there.
[436:28.50]At least, like, an afternoon and look through the window, right?
[436:34.52]That's happening in Las Vegas.
[436:35.58]Yeah.
[436:42.50]Compete in Evo.
[436:43.56]It's not gonna happen.
[436:50.39]Evo Road Trip.
[436:55.11]Go there and make a noise.
[436:56.65]What, like on cam?
[436:57.65]No, I'm not gonna be like a... You want me to be one of those dickheads?
[437:01.96]That it gets quiet and I go like...
[437:04.35]AY!
[437:04.51]IT'S ME, TERMA!
[437:05.87]Everyone's gonna be like, that guy's annoying.
[437:09.82]Like, maybe, like, 40 of you will think that was cool, and the rest of you will be like, alright, you just, like, fucked it all up.
[437:14.02]What are you doing?
[437:21.22]I forgot that was... yeah.
[437:22.30]I'm gonna have to get down there.
[437:26.10]I'll check it out.
[437:29.50]Thank you for reminding me, because I forgot that that was even happening.
[437:33.00]Now.
[437:34.96]But good luck.
[437:37.47]Competing in Smash Ultimate and Samurai Showdown.
[437:44.17]Well, I wish you the best.
[437:47.00]Hopefully you do well.
[437:51.50]That's really cool.
[437:53.38]Good luck to you, Squid Harry.
[437:59.36]Halo Soft, boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[438:01.64]Hey, if you're interested in more roguelikes that look fun, I've heard of Cataclysm, Dark Days Ahead, Ilona, RimWorld, Factorio, Space Station 13.
[438:14.07]Yeah, I've heard of Space Station 13.
[438:18.27]And then they said, shout out to Seth Zentich.
[438:22.63]This was a fun stream.
[438:24.47]It was a fun game.
[438:33.72]I very much enjoyed it.
[438:36.18]It's kind of a more of a play the game and hang out with chat kind of stream.
[438:40.78]But those are... I had a blast.
[438:43.63]It was great.
[438:44.67]It's a good experience.
[438:48.03]Thank you, Tingy, for the 250.
[438:49.11]I miss the old Jerma, the one that always had an end of stream joke.
[438:52.81]Not this new Jerma.
[438:53.79]All we get is an end of stream voice.
[438:58.24]Okay.
[438:59.86]Alright, fine.
[439:04.02]Alright.
[439:05.36]Fine.
[439:05.86]You want to get... I'll do it.
[439:07.22]Now you know what's happening.
[439:08.48]And it's over.
[439:12.96]Thank you, Tingy.
[439:13.62]Thank you, Tingy, for your 10 subs, too.
[439:14.92]You came with a lot of subs earlier.
[439:18.22]And those subs are going to be on the screen right now.
[439:25.57]I can't really express... How... How much I...
[439:33.94]Really, really, really appreciate everybody's support here.
[439:42.10]Sometimes when you, you know, if you're not live, this is a kind of a streamer insider thing that I'm sure other people have talked about.
[439:48.13]But if you're not live for like four, five, six days in a row, people tend to kind of drop off in subs.
[439:55.49]And that's fine.
[439:55.97]It's been perfectly understandable, right?
[439:57.21]You're not obligated to give anybody anything money-wise on the stream.
[440:01.57]But I noticed that almost nobody, it stayed almost exactly the same for like a week ago.
[440:06.60]And I opened that up and I was like, holy shit.
[440:12.90]So everybody that continues to sub to this channel, even when I'm not live, that's... I have no words.
[440:22.19]Thank you.
[440:27.57]Because that was one of the first things I noticed was like, holy shit, like nobody... Everybody's still here.
[440:33.14]You're all still here.
[440:39.31]Sometimes you get in your head as a streamer or a YouTuber, and you're like, oh, are they still going to be here in a week or two?
[440:46.69]Thanks for being here.
[440:49.01]Why would they leave?
[440:51.47]It's not that they wouldn't, or they would.
[440:53.55]It's just that sometimes it's, um... It goes through your head sometimes.
[440:59.88]Are people still having a good time?
[441:01.12]Is there still people still having fun?
[441:02.50]Do people still like me?
[441:06.68]So, thank you.
[441:07.40]They're gonna be on screen right now.
[441:13.04]Really appreciate it, everybody.
[441:21.14]Two years and I'm still here.
[441:22.60]That's what I mean.
[441:25.37]That's a long time.
[441:35.17]He says how much he appreciates as he counts his money.
[441:40.31]Do you remember, you passed your prime, but we love you.
[441:47.93]That was... Just wait... I know that.
[441:53.91]I'm 34.
[441:54.43]You don't have to tell me.
[441:56.85]I'm already very well aware of that.
[441:59.98]I'll be 35 in a year.
[442:02.24]Do you understand?
[442:02.82]I know that.
[442:08.10]You're not that old.
[442:09.14]There it is!
[442:10.02]Get into my head again, I don't know what to do!
[442:15.06]I'm not 34, haha, take that.
[442:26.57]No.
[442:27.97]As... As Dennis said in Always Sunny, I haven't even begun to peek.
[442:41.55]He's decaying.
[442:42.41]Alright, we still have some more bits to go.
[442:49.40]We have Sergil Butt for $2.50.
[442:51.50]Thank you, Sergil Butt.
[442:53.08]I won't be able to check out the stream tomorrow because I'll be at work.
[442:55.83]But you should definitely check out this website for Flash games called... I'm not going to read that.
[443:01.27]Because I've read that out loud before.
[443:03.89]And I was told what it was.
[443:05.61]So, no.
[443:08.36]No thanks.
[443:11.10]Thank you, ShortStack, for the $3.
[443:15.10]These are my last remaining bits.
[443:16.66]King, use them wisely for your retirement fund, apparently.
[443:19.81]Thanks for the laughs, as usual.
[443:20.97]Thank you.
[443:26.51]Thank you, ShortStack, for the $3.
[443:32.66]Thank you, thank you, thank you.

[443:38.07]Thanks for all the amazing streams.
[443:39.15]I hope you enjoy doing it for a long time.
[443:42.15]Well, I've already been doing it for a long time.
[443:44.47]And I still enjoy it, so... Kind of already there.
[443:49.84]It was my 8 year anniversary on the internet, making videos and streaming in June.
[443:55.76]So it's been 8 years.
[443:58.05]And I still like it.
[443:59.21]Still love it.
[444:01.61]Thank you for the $10, T Jake.

[445:17.87]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[445:19.15]Every strain, there's like something new that somebody made that was creative and really, really funny and interesting.
[445:26.28]gonna need a uh a -2 -2 shut up stop don't -2 me you're gonna need a like streamer metal detector that's set to funny like to try to find a better one
[445:51.05]Fucking comedy.
[445:51.93]Alright, let's keep going.
[445:52.91]But no, seriously, there's a lot of... There's a lot of funny people that are in this community.
[445:59.33]It's proven all the time.
[446:02.44]You know what I'm talking about.
[446:03.30]I don't need to say anymore.
[446:11.40]Gotta end this.
[446:11.88]Doctor's here, too.
[446:13.18]How many times has a bit message come in that says, Hey, Jerma, I'm a fucking doctor.
[446:17.90]I'm a scientist.
[446:19.44]I fly planes.
[446:22.65]It's almost, it's like 75% of every message.
[446:36.56]I can't help it.
[446:37.57]If there's things to play with in front of me, I'm going to play with them.
[446:40.01]I'm sorry.
[446:40.49]I put them down.
[446:56.46]Oh, you got the 10,000 seagulls.
[446:58.26]Time to delete the command.
[447:02.82]Using somebody else's achievements as a flex.
[447:06.23]No, that means that I, this stream, this streamer here, doctors gravitate towards this streamer.
[447:12.91]Doctors, scientists, lawyers, plane flyers, pilot, you know, they gravitate towards this stream.
[447:21.00]Why?
[447:21.74]Why are there so many doctors here?
[447:38.03]They're worried about you.
[447:40.45]Yeah, I heard about this guy, chairman of 995.
[447:42.29]He's like wicked fucked up.
[447:43.59]He had a bunch of like intestinal problems.
[447:45.97]I should probably check that out and see if I can help him.
[447:53.90]I'm being written down in like a textbook.
[448:07.14]very thoughtful of you guys yeah alright let's let's keep going okay you know when money stinks oh this this money stinks that heavy heavy heavy like iron smell that like metal like sweaty hands metal smell this is disgusting I haven't even touched this

[448:46.33]Ugh.
[448:48.03]I'm gonna wash this money.
[448:49.27]Is that weird?
[448:49.85]Would it be weird if you just filled up a little bowl of soapy water and washed the money?
[449:02.52]Is that weird?
[449:03.90]Why would that be weird?
[449:06.30]I don't want germs on my hands from the money from all the random people.
[449:10.66]Do you know how many people probably... Look.
[449:12.06]Do you know how many people probably touched this quarter?
[449:16.64]A lot, probably.
[449:17.26]There's probably at least a handful of people that touched that.
[449:21.38]Probably like 50.
[449:22.68]I don't know.
[449:27.98]How many people do you think touched this penny?
[449:31.92]How many people think touch these quarters?
[449:34.85]He's a fucking magician.
[449:36.11]He's pretty damn good.
[449:41.75]Hey.
[449:42.33]Hey!
[449:42.61]Hey!
[449:43.03]Hey!
[449:44.49]Hey!
[449:45.93]How many people think touch this penny?
[449:49.01]No strings.
[449:49.47]I don't have strings here.
[449:51.73]No strings!
[449:55.26]I'll prove it.
[450:02.04]How many people touched this penny?
[450:03.62]I don't know.
[450:04.10]You tell me, guys.
[450:04.88]Get outta here.
[450:19.99]Fake?
[450:21.77]I'm pretty fucking good.
[450:30.07]Hey.
[450:34.88]Hey.
[450:37.68]Oh, hold on.
[450:38.44]Hey.
[450:46.60]Hey.
[450:48.30]Nothing in my hands, right?
[450:49.73]Nothing in my hair.
[450:51.01]Nothing in the hair, right?
[450:52.37]No wires.
[450:53.01]No nothing.
[450:53.43]Keep an eye on my hands.
[450:57.93]Got one.
[451:01.59]How did that happen?
[451:13.41]You're gonna pull off your wig.
[451:23.82]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[451:26.72]Thank you to, uh, thank you to DubskiDude for the 250.
[451:29.58]Hey Jerma, the following is my most upvoted post on Reddit.
[451:34.65]Surprisingly, but something tells me you and chat would enjoy it.
[451:37.93]First link is an image, second is a quick story.
[451:39.97]Both are stream safe.
[451:42.85]I love how that's like a pretext.
[451:44.21]Hey, everything's stream safe.
[451:49.77]Um, you didn't actually do this though, right?
[451:52.94]If Jerma doesn't mod me in the next 24 hours, I'm taking this picture to Home Depot and asking them what they think.
[452:02.30]This has 1.2, this has one, almost one and a half thousand upvotes.
[452:10.67]Oh.
[452:11.69]Okay, so wait.
[452:14.94]Yesterday, I posted this pic demanding that I be modded or I unironically would visit Home Depot and show them the image.
[452:21.13]My demands were not met.
[452:22.11]The story is true.
[452:24.93]Everyone says that the story is true right before the story is not true.
[452:30.80]I started off by printing the aforementioned picture onto a 7x10 executive paper.
[452:34.80]The quality of the print was a B+, in my opinion.
[452:37.40]But it was lightly smeared by some rogue drops of cherry juice.
[452:40.77]I needed my vitamin C that morning.
[452:42.71]I couldn't redo the print as I had work in five hours and I didn't want to be late.
[452:46.55]Oh my god.
[453:17.85]I parked my car in a handicap zone.
[453:19.77]I'd only be there for a few hours, so no big deal.
[453:21.81]Alright.
[453:22.99]Come on.
[453:23.91]I just needed to focus and take deep breaths, else I would have had no story to share with the subreddit.
[453:30.28]These upvotes are really important to me.
[453:31.78]What else would I derive my own self-worth from?
[453:38.24]I entered the store and was hit with the trademark smell of fresh wood and paint thinner.
[453:42.85]It doesn't smell like that.
[453:43.63]The ba-
[454:03.75]The bathroom upholstery section was where I found myself.
[454:06.83]My anxiety would spike every time I came within five feet of another person and I'd tense up because I couldn't shake the thought that everyone knew why I was here and that they knew that I knew what they knew.
[454:17.62]I avoided eye contact at all costs and would talk to myself out loud anytime someone would walk by and attempt to make it seem like I was preoccupied.
[454:25.76]This toilet is a B+.
[454:27.26]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[454:30.02]This is a long fucking story.
[454:32.76]As an afterthought, I glanced towards the rental section.
[454:36.28]I saw an employee.
[454:37.00]They didn't seem busy.
[454:37.66]That was it.
[454:39.14]This was it.
[454:39.78]I had come so far already and I couldn't back out now.
[454:41.72]My knees began to visibly wobble.
[454:44.12]And my shoes were covered in paint thinner.
[454:46.75]That was the puddle?
[454:47.81]Why hadn't they cleaned that off the floor?
[454:49.53]Fuck, I don't know.
[454:50.35]But before I knew, I was up in front of this female Home Depot clerk's... She looked up at me with baby blue eyes.
[454:57.97]How can I help you?
[455:03.98]It felt like all my internal organs had crowded into my throat.
[455:06.74]I was stunned.
[455:07.94]I didn't know what to say.
[455:09.28]What the hell was I doing here?
[455:10.26]I had driven all this way to show some innocent person a Photoshop picture of a Twitch streamer.
[455:14.02]Had I truly lost my damn mind?
[455:15.48]The print out of my hand was drenched in sweat, cherry juice, and paint thinner, which had smeared the ink into a bizarre collage of colors and shapes.
[455:24.63]My hands were trembling, but as I was on autopilot, I laid it on the counter and I said, What do you think of this?
[455:31.71]It felt like time had stopped.
[455:32.99]I was done for.
[455:33.55]I would never be able to live with myself after this.
[455:35.43]The employee squinted at the picture with a very confused look on her face.
[455:38.19]Is this?
[455:39.20]She whispered and then paused.
[455:40.86]The pause felt like an eternity.
[455:42.60]I should just turn and get out of the store.
[455:44.66]I should just leave now and undo the damage I'd done to my self-confidence.
[455:48.32]But my feet were like concrete.
[455:49.46]The paint on my shoes was particularly thin at that point.
[455:52.67]Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
[455:56.82]A huge burden... This is how you know the story ain't real.
[455:59.46]A huge burden instantly rolled off my chest.
[456:01.46]I couldn't believe my luck.
[456:02.40]Another human being in my town that understood.
[456:04.90]We both began shouting the most obscure Jerma memes in the store, and our celebration caused quite the scene.
[456:10.48]Customers began gathering in a crowd around us.
[456:12.82]It was Twitch chat.
[456:13.76]There were PogChamps and jermaHearts and jermaChomps.
[456:17.26]Bits rained like confetti, and even Nightbot was there, muting a few people.
[456:20.72]Oh, that Nightbot.
[456:27.80]Why am I reading this whole thing?
[456:29.88]Why am I doing this?
[456:31.16]But then the absolute worst thing imaginable happened.
[456:33.06]The Home Depot manager, drawn by the commotion, stomped through the crowd.
[456:36.47]He had a Grillmaster XBBQ badge on his chest.
[456:41.15]He looked me dead in the eyes and said, "'Why the hell did you bother writing this entire thing?'
[456:48.21]I was dumbfounded.
[456:49.01]How did he know?
[456:49.73]All I could do was turn to you, the reader, and ask you, "'Why did you read all this?'
[456:54.97]Your eyes drifted down the length of this final sentence in your brain.
[456:57.59]In your brain, you heard the word jebaited.
[457:00.83]GG, idiot.
[457:02.45]That's it.
[457:17.62]Remember when we talked about deep fakes?
[457:22.84]In like 50 years...
[457:26.36]Like, this story is just gonna be here.
[457:32.52]Somebody is gonna come across this somehow, somewhere, a hundred years from now and be like, what the fuck happened here?
[457:43.39]Who was this person that they're talking about?
[457:46.43]Who wrote this?
[457:51.54]You know how many of these exist?
[457:53.94]This... In, like, 200 years, people are gonna have so much trouble interpreting human history.
[458:09.27]You know, like, we don't know, really, what the hell happened, like, a fucking thousand years ago.
[458:15.33]We are reading, like, for instance, um... Like, shit that happened in, like, the fucking 1400s.
[458:23.36]That shit was, like, written down and, like, spoken and passed down from person to person.
[458:28.16]Who knows if one of those stories that you heard about, like, King fucking Edward II or whatever could just be a jebaited Twitch chat to somebody who made it up for fun.
[458:38.57]How would you ever even know?
[458:47.51]Who knows if half of the material in history could have just been a shitpost.
[458:54.64]And they were laughing about it like, can you imagine in 2000 years if they ever find the Home Depot story?
[459:06.77]In fucking 500 years, there's going to be an HBO special about this post.
[459:15.85]There'll be a seven part miniseries about this post.
[459:26.84]That's literally what mythology is.
[459:28.84]Yeah, in 500 years, we're gonna be the mythology.
[459:40.25]What is our legacy?
[459:56.99]I'm worthy of being mythology hbo is going to be around in 500 years what the is going to be around in 500 years don't you kind of just want to know what's going to be the most popular TV show in 500 years what is it going to be what is it what store are people going to go into
[460:23.17]What's everybody's favorite food?
[460:24.58]What's the pizza of 500 years in the future?
[460:28.32]Is it still pizza?
[460:30.34]I mean, pizzas lasted a pretty long damn time.
[460:33.62]People were eating pizza like St.
[460:39.09]Christopher Columbus was eating pizza.
[460:51.05]That's not that long ago.
[461:01.49]He was eating Papa John's.
[461:07.36]It's probably still going to be pizza.
[461:10.58]And this Home Depot story.
[461:14.96]Do I genuinely think there will be humans in 500 years?
[461:17.85]Well, apparently, because I can't retire.
[461:19.19]I have to keep streaming, so...
[461:22.96]I hope so.
[461:23.46]There better be.
[461:31.24]That was DubskiDude.
[461:32.82]Thank you for that elaborate story.
[461:36.12]Flugboy, thanks for the five bucks.
[461:37.40]Just dropping to say that I had quite a bit of a scare the other night when my account was taken.
[461:42.56]But I'm back.
[461:43.82]And I have the 1,000k 100k badge.
[461:48.59]Here's to 1,000 more dollars.
[461:49.57]Jerma.
[461:53.43]Thank you.
[461:54.81]Glad you got your account back.
[461:56.87]Also, if you were interested at all in Destiny 2, it's free September 17th with all year one content.
[462:05.75]Pretty good to know.
[462:10.09]Thank you, Floodboy.
[462:10.82]Glad you got your account back.
[462:15.20]I think I've played Destiny 2 for a little while, but in my brain, Destiny 2 and The Division 2 are the same game.
[462:25.69]I cannot separate them.
[462:27.83]You know, like, it's the same image joke?
[462:30.12]It's that.
[462:31.96]Every time I hear of Division 2, it's Destiny 2.
[462:34.34]Every time I hear of Destiny 2, it's Division 2.
[462:40.76]I don't know they're not.
[462:41.86]I know they're not.
[462:50.05]They are.
[462:50.81]Are they?
[462:51.03]I don't know.
[462:54.03]Alright.
[462:55.09]Good night, everybody.
[462:56.91]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[462:57.65]We're just gonna chill.
[462:59.85]Trying to do easier streams recently just because of the internet.
[463:05.68]I don't really want to set up any elaborate cool shit to do.
[463:08.36]Oh!
[463:09.22]It's turned off.
[463:10.62]Bye.
[463:12.34]So.
[463:12.94]We'll do just a little hangout stream tomorrow.
[463:15.62]Do some more tierless hangout on cam.
[463:18.51]Chill.
[463:20.53]See you tomorrow.
[463:22.07]Have a great rest of your night.
[463:22.73]Thanks for sticking around.
[463:23.63]We kind of went pretty late tonight, so... Same time tomorrow.

[463:31.06]Have a great night.
[463:32.52]I know.
[463:32.74]I'll put them down.
