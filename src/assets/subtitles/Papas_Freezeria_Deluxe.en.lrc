[01:04.41]What's up?
[01:06.75]How's it going?
[01:16.28]What's happening?
[01:20.48]No fucking way.
[01:22.84]What do you mean?
[01:23.28]Like, no way that I'm here?
[01:27.60]No way.
[01:29.13]No way.
[01:30.15]What?
[01:31.09]What's going on here?
[01:34.23]Are you that shocked that I'm streaming?
[01:39.13]Can't believe this dude's actually streaming.
[01:40.65]What the heck has he been?
[01:43.47]Alright, let me tweet this one second.
[01:55.08]Here we go.
[01:58.72]My Twitter analytics must be absolute dog shit.
[02:04.71]All of my tweets are either sponsored tweets or they're go-live tweets.
[02:08.39]And then sometimes, like, once a year, I'll have a tweet that has, like, 5 million views.
[02:13.67]And everything else is just way, way, way under that.
[02:16.36]My analytics must be awful.
[02:19.90]Must be, like, the shittiest analytics of any Twitter account.
[02:26.52]Oh, whatever.
[02:26.94]Who cares?
[02:32.27]Did you tweet something funny?
[02:34.45]That's, I guess, up to you.
[02:39.65]Oh, I did have a fake Mario movie tweet.
[02:42.23]I could read a draft or two.
[02:43.90]Why not?
[02:45.36]Let's see what this one is.
[02:50.12]Did I talk about this one?
[02:59.69]Alright, I'll read it.
[03:00.51]Well, should I wait till people come in?
[03:05.61]I actually like this one.
[03:13.62]Chat faked an entire stream.
[03:15.43]Yeah, I heard about that.
[03:23.51]We're gonna chill.
[03:25.17]Yeah, we're gonna play.
[03:25.71]Alright, here's the plan.
[03:26.94]I want to go over the weekend.
[03:29.24]Yes, the plan is to be live today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
[03:34.62]Today, we're gonna play Papa's Freezeria.
[03:38.68]Is it Freezeria?
[03:40.02]Freezeria.
[03:41.08]What the fuck?
[03:42.22]I'm just realizing right now.
[03:44.16]It's Freezeria.
[03:46.17]Freezeria is what I thought it was for five, ten years.
[03:50.41]Ten years ago, I called it Freezeria.
[03:55.16]Why would I do that?
[03:56.44]I'm just... Why?
[03:58.00]That's weird.
[04:05.53]Anyways.
[04:07.15]You can't read?
[04:08.01]I can read.
[04:09.63]Freezeria isn't a word.
[04:11.11]Oh, wait.
[04:15.99]If you look up Freezeria in the dictionary, is Papa's face there?
[04:18.79]Because it better be.
[04:27.37]Alright, anyways, we're going to play this today.
[04:28.69]We have Papa's Freezeria.
[04:31.03]This is the deluxe version.
[04:33.71]The deluxe version is on Steam now, apparently.
[04:37.11]I don't know what that means.
[04:38.75]I'm just going to chill and play it.
[04:41.09]Tomorrow, we might play something else.
[04:42.47]Depends on how long this one goes for.
[04:47.27]Also, tomorrow the plan is to do 90s ads.
[04:51.54]Watch some old 90s ads.
[04:54.14]Be fun.
[04:56.40]And then Sunday, I want to do the House Flipper Farm DLC.
[05:04.56]Looks like a pretty extensive update to that game.
[05:09.90]So there's your weekend plan.
[05:12.62]I think you can build your own house now in House Flipper, right?
[05:19.42]It looks like you can build a whole house from scratch.
[05:21.10]I don't know why I made that sound like it was a
[05:25.38]Like a chocolate pudding recipe.
[05:29.95]Anyways, let's read this tweet.
[05:31.41]This giraffe tweet.
[05:34.05]By the way, I want to make it really clear.
[05:35.01]I have not seen the Mario movie.
[05:36.87]So I don't even... We're just going to read this.
[05:39.53]I've not seen the Mario movie.
[05:42.13]I just watched the Mario movie and was getting really fidgety and visibly annoyed.
[05:47.00]They took way too long for the first Biahu.
[05:51.82]It was alright.
[06:01.19]Is it great?
[06:01.73]Send it.
[06:05.80]I'm just imagining somebody sitting there just fucking pissed, like fidgeting around like, where is it?
[06:11.09]Come on.
[06:13.20]god damn it and Holly said something funny she's like we haven't seen this movie what if what if Mario does a yahoo in the first like 10 seconds like wow that really sounds fucked up doesn't it does it happen in the first 10 seconds oh they took way too long for the first yahoo and if it happens in the first five minutes of the movie that I don't know I thought that made it funnier
[06:43.02]He literally does.
[06:46.56]He byahus really quickly.
[06:48.02]That's the only reason he went to go to see the movie.
[06:57.85]It's his first word in the movie?
[07:02.93]Who cares?
[07:07.17]It's literally the first word in the movie and it's in the trailer.
[07:12.35]Oh, they took way too fucking long for the first Biahu.
[07:16.57]I was fidgeting and annoyed in my seat.
[07:24.60]Alright.
[07:26.42]Well, there it is.
[07:26.94]The movie is fire, though.
[07:31.88]Oh, we're definitely going to see it.
[07:33.82]We need to find some time to see it.
[07:42.13]OK, so we're going to play Papa's Freezeria.
[07:47.53]I don't want to say I'm a huge fan of the Papa games.
[07:51.23]I've played them a few times.
[07:55.71]Relax, pull up a chair.
[07:57.49]If you're already sitting, then good.
[08:01.80]I guess if you're already sitting down.
[08:02.88]I actually don't even know how you play these.
[08:08.54]They're kind of like Diner Dash, right?
[08:12.12]they operate similarly if they like serve customers and they get mad if you take too long right no oh wait oh that is how it is isn't it okay well let's go here is Papa's Freezeria hey there we go okay let's get started uh we'll do this one
[08:42.49]We're at a custom worker.
[08:43.71]I mean, we kind of have to do that, don't we?
[08:48.51]Custom worker?
[08:50.47]Yeah, this is deluxe.
[08:51.87]I don't know what the deluxe means.
[08:52.87]Okay.
[09:01.55]Wait, you can change the position of your head?
[09:03.18]Okay.
[09:10.00]I'm alright with this.
[09:17.37]You can do gamer neck or normal.
[09:26.75]Oh, this is actually a lot.
[09:30.47]How are there more hair options in Papa's Freezeria than half of the AAA games I've ever played?
[09:35.94]Doesn't that kind of make you a little annoyed?
[09:40.14]And I'm talking way more.
[09:50.24]How about that?
[09:52.94]Is there hair color?
[10:01.54]It's 2D.
[10:02.84]It's 2D.
[10:05.90]Yeah.
[10:09.42]Yeah, that's true.
[10:14.72]Let's be fair.
[10:18.05]We're definitely going with the mustache, 100%.
[10:24.30]Hold on.
[10:29.56]Where's Bald?
[10:30.06]I kind of want to make the Pringles guy.
[10:31.56]What does the Pringles guy look like?
[10:54.16]Pringles guy look like?
[10:58.72]Can I change the eyes?
[10:59.55]Okay.
[11:06.81]The Pringles guy doesn't really have a mouth.
[11:09.15]No, it's not like that.
[11:10.89]The mustache covers the mouth.
[11:20.28]The Pringles guy has hair.
[11:21.76]He does?! !
[11:26.10]does he does have hair he has hair why do I think he doesn't have hair I'm telling you right now the Pringles guy just did not have hair until right now and so you just all said it it's a middle part isn't it like this right
[11:57.83]Oh, let me look this up.
[11:58.75]Pringles guy.
[11:59.63]Okay, Pringles guy.
[12:02.06]What does he look like?
[12:06.38]He does have hair.
[12:09.42]I'm thinking of the Monopoly man.
[12:11.50]The Monopoly man has the mustache and is bald.
[12:14.83]The Pringles guy has a middle part and a mustache.
[12:19.29]Okay.
[12:22.73]Well, now I know.
[12:24.97]It's kind of this mustache as well.
[12:28.94]Monopoly Man has a top hat.
[12:30.28]Yeah, he's still bald.
[12:41.67]That looks pretty good.
[12:46.93]This looks good.
[12:47.37]I think this is fine.
[12:48.39]Okay.
[12:54.20]Ooh, eyebrows.
[12:55.20]Wait!
[12:57.28]Should we get rid of the hair and just do eyebrows for hair?
[13:00.56]Kind of like that, isn't it?
[13:01.32]Ah, that's too much work.
[13:07.04]I don't think the eyebrows can be big enough for that to make sense.
[13:12.23]What's the biggest eyebrows?
[13:13.27]These ones?
[13:17.07]I don't, I can't make these bigger.
[13:34.11]No brows.
[13:36.01]He has no eyebrows.
[13:37.13]Alright, what was it?
[13:45.22]It's the middle part, or is it right here somewhere?
[13:53.26]Should we get... No eyebrows, you're saying?
[13:54.44]Okay.
[14:04.88]Okay, I think that's good.
[14:07.10]What about glasses?
[14:13.06]This feels like... This feels like they updated the Pringles guy.
[14:18.87]Right?
[14:19.21]Doesn't it feel like, oh, yeah, no, we took the Pringles guy.
[14:21.41]We wanted to update his look a little.
[14:26.09]I don't like the updated Pringles guy.
[14:35.49]We gave the Pringles guy glasses.
[14:38.06]Oh, uh, okay.
[14:44.31]Hipster.
[14:51.54]I'm gonna keep it like this.
[15:00.06]What do you mean, no?
[15:01.04]Hey guys, my character's done.
[15:04.58]No, it's not.
[15:05.56]Yeah, it is.
[15:06.30]It's done.
[15:06.81]I'm done.
[15:07.45]My character's done.
[15:08.15]I'm keeping it like this.
[15:15.11]No.

[15:18.09]Alright, your chef's name.
[15:26.35]What's my chef's name?
[15:27.51]I don't know.
[15:31.41]Oh, is the window too small?
[15:32.99]No, wait, wait, wait.

[16:05.30]Melvin's kind of nice.
[16:06.40]Yeah, I'll do Melvin.
[16:09.10]Just Melvin.
[16:10.62]Alright, Melvin.
[16:12.90]I'm ready.
[16:15.31]Melvin's new job.

[16:20.71]Worker's Guide.
[16:23.85]Calypso Island population.
[16:25.07]Isn't it like 12 people that live here?
[16:31.66]12 people on this whole island?
[16:32.88]Alright, hold on.
[16:38.47]I was trying to make Papa.
[16:40.25]Why have I combined every one of these characters?
[16:44.03]I just look like a dickhead.
[16:45.11]I look like I'm showing up to work pretending to be him.
[16:47.65]I was trying to make him the whole time.
[16:53.65]Alright.
[16:59.59]He really does look like the Pringles guy.
[17:05.83]How come he can look like that, but I can't?
[17:10.74]Okay, day one.
[17:13.42]Welcome to Papa's Freezeria.
[17:15.30]Let's get started with training.
[17:16.28]Okay.
[17:19.22]You copy down each customer's order onto an order ticket.
[17:22.56]Garlic on your... What kind of person wants garlic on their ice cream?
[17:27.74]Switch to the build station and start preparing ice cream and ingredients.
[17:30.24]Okay.
[17:33.93]Watch the meter on the ice cream machine.
[17:35.65]Wait until it's centered, then press the pour button.
[17:39.67]Good.
[17:42.13]Alright, and now we need a mixable from the mixable machine.
[17:46.13]They want strawberries.
[17:50.47]That was not very good.
[17:52.79]They want strawberry syrup?
[17:56.90]That's a little too many strawberries, don't you think?
[17:58.30]Okay.
[18:02.12]And then drag the cup onto the blender.
[18:04.95]I've always wanted to see how this worked.
[18:09.49]Watch the blend meter on the blender and wait until it looks like what they ordered on the ticket.
[18:13.13]Huh.
[18:19.21]How long does this take?
[18:23.99]Okay.
[18:24.85]It's blended.
[18:25.39]Ooh, it looks pretty good.
[18:28.20]Another one.
[18:28.66]Oh, it's whipped cream.
[18:29.46]Okay.
[18:33.48]Well... I didn't know that when I... I thought I had to click it.
[18:38.03]It just goes?
[18:39.51]It just starts going when I let go of the button.
[18:45.51]I didn't press to do that.
[18:47.99]Tap the shakers button.
[18:49.15]Switch your type of shakers.
[18:52.45]This is too elaborate.
[18:53.35]Okay.

[19:15.49]It was awful.
[19:19.73]Wait, the whipped cream was next to it.
[19:21.33]Yeah, I thought you ordered it on the side.
[19:24.25]It's like salad dressing.
[19:28.95]Alright, you want a medium blended Reese's with chocolate, chocolate whipped cream, double chocolate, Oreos, and then... Um, okay.

[44:06.40]I don't know why.
[44:07.04]I thought I was the person at the very bottom.
[44:09.81]I would love to restart this.
[44:16.91]Alright, let me do that again.
[44:18.49]Also, the frame rate of this game kind of hurts my head.
[44:21.95]I gotta be very honest.

[46:35.65]I mean, this table is a must-have.
[46:37.07]Look at how tacky this is.
[46:41.09]You know how annoying this would be to clean?
[46:48.62]Because all the food, all the strip would just get in the crevices.
[46:51.64]It'd be so annoying.
[46:55.76]Ooh.
[46:56.52]Hold on.
[47:01.97]Get the doorbell.

[53:53.57]It's alright, I fucked it up.
[54:05.49]This looks like it melted for like a half an hour.
[54:09.46]This is why I always want to eat one of these before... You pull over, you park, and you eat this.
[54:14.72]Because if you just let it sit in the fucking cup holder, it turns into this by the time you get back.
[54:23.81]You pull over, and you park, and you eat it.
[54:27.70]Serve it already.

[55:44.41]Working on it right now.
[55:48.26]Hey, I just opened a fresh can of white chocolate for you.
[55:59.67]These sprinkles?
[56:00.51]No, these sprinkles, I don't wanna serve these to you.
[56:03.02]Let me open up a new thing of sprinkles for you.
[56:16.42]Alright!
[56:17.62]Hey, by the way.
[56:18.12]Thanks.
[56:27.01]That wasn't that bad.
[56:27.77]Alright.
[56:36.11]I will allow one comedy.
[56:37.51]I'm gonna allow one comedy order.
[56:41.06]Where we just give a person a cup of cherries or something.
[56:45.82]That's fine for me.
[56:46.48]We'll do... Why am I... Why am I... Okay, I was like, what the hell?
[56:58.38]You guys ever want the actual... the actual tactic to do that?
[57:03.04]So, always keep your mouse cursor right in the middle.
[57:07.19]And don't shoot at any of the discs that come out until kind of close to the end.
[57:14.37]Don't do this.
[57:15.47]Stay right here, they're gonna cross the middle plane.
[57:19.33]You won't have to move very far from here to get most of them.
[57:21.41]You get what I'm saying?
[57:33.78]Why did you instinctively point the- I don't know, I just was like, shoot this thing!
[57:40.98]Always make sure you come right back to the middle after every shot.
[57:45.41]I was distracted by you.
[57:52.21]Ooh, nutty buttercups.
[57:55.45]Alright.
[57:56.39]Cool.
[58:02.29]What is this?
[58:03.67]A little carnival table?
[58:07.46]Can I make a bunch of obstacles so it takes them longer to get to the window?
[58:12.86]I think that's a big mistake.
[58:14.02]A lot of businesses that have lines, there should be a handful of those mall toy stands that have the back-flipping dog and shit.
[58:27.31]Just give people shit to do.
[58:30.47]Put kinetic sand samples over here.
[58:32.39]You know what I'm saying?
[58:37.06]And make that part of the line.
[58:43.24]Alright, that looks good.
[58:43.80]Alright, they can get delivery.
[58:47.68]Um...
[59:25.16]Are you giving him hair?
[59:35.95]Make Miku.
[59:37.97]Why do you guys want me to put Miku in every single video game?
[59:41.03]Do you understand?
[59:49.12]What does Miku's hair look like?
[59:50.58]Why am I...
[59:54.06]Why am I even entertaining this?
[60:04.07]Uh, where is it?
[60:11.35]Like that?
[60:11.79]No.
[60:11.85]It's like that.
[60:15.58]Like that?
[60:16.54]Like that?
[60:16.90]I don't... Like this?
[60:25.06]Like that?
[60:28.10]This one?
[60:30.84]This one?
[60:32.97]Oh, wait.
[60:33.61]What about the front?
[60:44.45]Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[60:46.31]I got it, I got it.
[60:55.61]This is close enough.
[60:57.53]This is fine.
[61:01.47]Okay.
[61:02.71]Okay.
[61:04.11]Okay.
[61:06.08]And we need...
[61:34.52]That's correct, right?
[61:36.96]That looks fun.
[61:50.87]Can you change the eyebrow color?
[61:52.02]I don't think so.
[61:54.88]Different color, different color.
[61:59.38]Like that?
[62:01.30]What is closer?
[62:02.08]It's this one then, isn't it?
[62:03.30]Is it though?
[62:03.88]I feel like it's not.
[62:05.67]I don't... I feel like that's not correct.
[62:08.17]No, that's too green.
[62:09.11]Yeah, that's way too green.
[62:18.60]This one's definitely closer.
[62:19.52]Although maybe... It's between these two.
[62:26.32]This one's too blue and this one's too green, but we have to live with one of these.
[62:31.61]I'm going to keep this one.
[62:36.62]There.
[62:38.96]Pull up an image.
[62:39.56]I got one right here.
[62:43.46]In the mod chat, I got some help.
[62:44.72]Okay.
[62:50.04]This is fine.
[62:51.90]What about the neck?
[62:58.15]That's not correct either.
[63:08.12]Okay, it looks pretty good.
[63:16.30]Um... Longer neck.
[63:21.67]Longer neck.
[63:27.51]This is fine.
[63:28.35]This is fine.
[63:29.21]This is fine.
[63:29.79]This is fine.
[63:30.25]Okay, I'm done.
[63:30.77]I'm done.
[63:30.97]I'm done.
[63:39.42]Nevada.
[63:40.40]Okay.
[63:43.16]Strawberry wafer.
[63:44.02]Alright, let's go.
[63:56.51]Medium blended blueberry, strawberry, strawberry.
[63:59.29]I have to keep... Okay.
[64:02.73]I'm putting these in a line so I know that the first thing that I do is this one.
[64:07.38]Every time.
[64:09.65]This is one in this descending order.
[64:14.99]Strawberry.
[64:16.81]Good.
[64:19.14]Alright, who's next?
[64:25.68]I'm just going to get one ready.
[64:26.60]Should I pre-make?
[64:31.16]Oh, hold on.
[64:31.77]Hold on, telephone.
[64:33.73]Your driver will take orders from customers who call on the phone.
[64:35.87]They'll also deliver the food to their home when it's ready.
[64:37.57]Okay.
[64:41.77]Got it.
[64:42.01]Marshmallow mint.
[64:46.65]Go.
[64:47.11]Alright.
[64:51.97]This is the second order.
[64:53.05]Two is in this slot.
[65:00.26]Biko is working really hard.
[65:01.56]Yeah.
[65:02.30]No, we're good.
[65:06.14]Alright.
[65:06.74]First one.
[65:07.46]I know I should do the other way.
[65:08.52]Other way around.
[65:10.46]That's the plan.
[65:13.02]That's way more efficient.
[65:13.98]That helps way more.
[65:14.90]Let's go.
[65:23.16]Alright, we need strawberry whipped cream.
[65:28.00]Coconut syrup.
[65:29.96]These.
[65:35.12]And some strawberry wafers.
[65:41.29]This actually looks kind of good.
[65:43.58]It's 100%.
[65:48.04]Alright, come on, hurry up.
[65:57.38]I actually would much prefer you just scream this to me when I'm in the back.
[66:08.36]Where's marshmallows?
[66:09.04]Oh, I got it, I got it.
[66:17.77]Hurry up.
[66:20.53]I'm going to get that phone.
[66:21.53]I'm going to get that phone.
[66:24.76]Somebody get that phone.
[66:27.78]You want to, okay.
[66:32.10]What, what the hell are you ordering?
[66:33.30]What was this?
[66:41.96]Just walk in here in the sun.
[66:54.07]Get this off the screen, I can't see.
[66:55.47]Stop telling me that I'm playing poorly and just get off the screen.
[66:59.34]Get off the screen.
[67:02.64]Get off the screen!
[67:03.48]What?
[67:07.70]I don't want it on the help page.
[67:17.13]No, throw this away.
[67:23.58]Alright.
[67:24.36]What?
[67:24.64]I was in the middle of something.
[67:26.36]It's this one here.
[67:26.94]Okay.
[67:27.26]Alright.
[67:27.56]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[67:28.22]What am I missing?
[67:31.69]Strawberry lemonade bullshit.
[67:33.01]Alright.
[67:33.23]Alright.
[67:45.23]Sounds good.
[67:48.05]This one's spinning.
[67:48.65]This one is this one.
[67:49.45]I need a strawberry brownie.
[67:53.04]Quickly.
[67:53.40]I don't even know how to make it, so I'm going to do this one first.
[67:56.78]This one here.
[68:03.02]Alright, strawberry brownie.
[68:05.06]Is brownie.
[68:07.80]No shit.
[68:08.26]Who would have thought?
[68:14.23]And then strawberry.
[68:15.11]Shit, sorry.
[68:17.95]Alright, we're good.
[68:28.59]This is coming off first.
[68:38.38]Okay, we need this.
[68:42.86]I know people are mad that I didn't give anybody just strawberry syrup, but I know.
[68:50.55]Pretty happy.
[69:03.81]This is... Which one is this?
[69:05.63]This one?
[69:06.63]Alright.
[69:06.83]Go, go, go, go, go.
[69:07.43]Quick.
[69:08.75]I'll get all these out at the same time.
[69:11.11]Peanuts.
[69:14.59]And then a cherry.
[69:15.23]Very easy order.
[69:18.06]Very easy.
[69:18.70]Good.
[69:23.02]Almost perfect.
[69:29.87]Alright, now this is chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup.
[69:33.29]Wait, what's going on?
[69:35.57]Yep.
[69:48.62]Good.
[69:49.12]Now the last bits are chocolate chips.
[69:53.76]And want free cherries.
[70:02.06]Perfectly placed.
[70:02.68]This is so much sugar.
[70:05.48]Yeah, this is like 4,000 calories.
[70:16.27]True.
[70:18.67]It's a lot of calories.
[70:29.06]Marshmallow Pro.
[70:30.02]What does that mean?
[70:33.65]Blender ball.
[70:34.63]There's a lot of these little mini games.
[70:35.85]I like these.
[70:39.45]Am I at max power?
[70:47.16]I just won the game.
[70:58.21]Okay.
[70:59.33]Come on.
[71:07.77]What?
[71:11.70]Food truck free play?
[71:13.78]Hold on.
[71:14.50]Looks good.
[71:20.82]Okay.
[71:24.73]Okay.
[71:31.35]Is that the parade?
[71:40.23]The food truck is the best shit in the most recent mobile game.
[71:43.99]I'll check it out.
[72:00.36]I left the- I left the brain.
[72:03.64]I got work to do.
[72:09.16]I haven't seen any stickers.
[72:10.22]Alright, let's go.
[72:13.16]Oh, I want to do the free play.
[72:22.90]Wally.
[72:26.34]I'll take a medium blended blueberry with some strawberries, some whipped cream with the blue in it, and then I also would like some plum and some peanuts, please.
[72:36.50]Thank you.
[72:59.83]I can sit right here.
[73:00.43]I look like I'm in a costume.
[73:06.31]Some days your dining room will be open and your driver will take orders from customers who are dining instead of delivering orders.
[73:12.40]Oh, they actually come sit down.
[73:14.58]Okay.
[73:15.94]What do you want?
[73:17.76]Oreo cookie?
[73:19.35]Alright, Oreos.
[73:21.03]How blended is this?
[73:23.09]We're good.
[73:24.89]Get that up there.
[73:28.03]How we doing?
[73:30.03]Good.
[73:36.31]That one actually sounds pretty good.
[73:38.43]It does, yeah.
[73:38.93]Yep, I'm taking it.
[73:59.99]Okay.
[74:02.25]Uh, this is still blending.
[74:03.23]Get this out of the way.
[74:04.71]This one is the one I need to be focusing on.
[74:07.61]So we need... God damn it.
[74:11.25]Whatever.
[74:11.75]Fine.
[74:15.67]This looks good, too.
[74:16.37]I can't remember the last time I actually had a, like, wacky, wild-ass ice cream.
[74:26.23]I would consider this to be a wacky ass ice cream.
[74:29.55]There's a ton of different flavors and toppings and it's been, it's been a very long time.
[74:33.12]Things are definitely done by now.
[74:45.90]Alright, you wanted this.
[74:52.16]White chocolate.
[74:56.20]White chocolate does get a pretty bad rap, doesn't it?
[75:00.38]I think it makes sense in some places, but I really just don't like it in a lot of places.
[75:03.42]How did I backtrack that before you guys even yelled at me about it?
[75:07.16]That was interesting.
[75:09.14]87%?
[75:09.16]Cake.
[75:33.00]Alright, the hardest thing to make in the whole restaurant.
[75:35.54]Okay, let's go.
[75:38.63]I gotta memorize this.
[75:39.47]And then it's brownie, strawberry.
[75:46.63]Another person just came in.
[75:47.53]Alright, it's strawberry.
[75:48.73]Alright, alright, alright.
[75:50.67]What do you want?
[75:54.52]White chocolate is usually good for two bites.
[75:57.16]Yeah, it's fine.
[75:58.20]It's fine.
[76:27.44]I'll make a funny one.
[76:29.88]I want to at least make enough money.
[76:31.26]Okay, hold on.
[76:43.83]And then a cherry.
[76:45.19]And we're good.
[76:47.67]Now get out of here!
[76:55.45]Tropical treat?
[76:57.55]Well, you took me- you took too long for telling me about my new tropical treat.
[77:00.93]Alright, what the hell is on this?
[77:04.29]It's... this?
[77:06.67]Took too late.
[77:15.57]Then it's three brownie- Ah, it's even more bullshit.
[77:32.65]We're good?
[77:33.03]Take it off!
[77:40.50]Is there really a complaint, though?
[77:42.70]My blended ice cream was blended too much.
[77:47.67]Doesn't it hit a point where it doesn't blend at all anymore?
[77:49.77]How would you even tell that?
[77:55.38]It's because it gets soupy?
[78:03.22]31%.
[78:03.28]You'd be really unhappy.
[78:05.58]It's really soupy.
[78:07.30]It's all good.
[78:24.88]Don't overmix.
[78:25.56]I like these minigames.
[78:31.72]Slider Escape.
[78:34.40]Okay.
[78:35.12]Slide the burger slider towards the goal.
[78:37.02]Oh, it's one of these.
[78:40.30]It only... it has to move the whole way into the wall.
[78:45.90]Got it.
[79:03.17]He's not gonna make it?
[79:04.78]Well, I already did.
[79:06.46]I got it.
[79:18.46]Alright, I'm rank 5.
[79:26.53]New special.
[79:27.05]Alright, I wanna do the tropical tree.
[79:30.31]I would probably like this.
[79:36.06]Yeah, just put a bunch of shit everywhere.
[79:37.18]No stickers.
[79:43.46]You can now send your driver out in a food truck between work days to make any food you choose.
[79:48.51]Okay.
[79:55.46]Customers won't place any orders at the food truck.
[79:57.18]Just make whatever you like and see who shows up to buy it.
[80:01.39]Oh, alright, let's go.
[80:03.01]I'm gonna make my favorite.
[80:04.69]This is exactly what I would be doing.
[80:06.79]Alright.
[80:07.59]Bingo.
[80:10.71]Oreo.
[80:13.77]Moon.
[80:17.25]Not blended at all.
[80:18.25]Oh.
[80:25.46]Look at that.
[80:27.34]Lightly blended.
[80:28.90]Still tons of chunks.
[80:34.36]And if it were me, I'm topping this with a little bit of regular whipped cream.
[80:39.28]Just a tiny bit.
[80:41.20]Well, never mind.
[80:45.80]And then a little bit of chocolate at the end.
[80:55.67]And really give him something to take a picture of.
[80:57.53]You know what I mean?
[81:01.24]Yeah, I'm the only guy in town that gives you a whole sleeve of Oreos.
[81:08.13]There's part of it.
[81:09.37]By the way, this shit's only fucking four dollars.
[81:29.59]Holy shit, it's awesome!
[81:36.41]Okay, hold on.
[81:37.11]Can I change the flavor of ice cream?
[81:44.21]No, how about just plain?
[81:48.71]Oh.
[81:48.91]Can I just do plain soft serve?
[81:54.49]Marshmallow?
[81:59.07]Oh, yeah.
[82:00.25]Marshmallow, banana, blend that.
[82:02.11]And you know what?
[82:03.05]Check this out.
[82:04.13]Blend the fuck out of that.
[82:08.54]Oh, my mouth is already salivating.
[82:10.92]My mouth is watering.
[82:24.40]I wouldn't do anything else to this.
[82:43.18]Look at that.
[82:48.63]That's almost 100%.
[82:53.73]Don't ever make ice cream again.
[82:54.91]That would be amazing.
[82:58.33]Alright, we have to make a Miku shake.
[83:02.42]Alright, we're going to do blueberry.
[83:03.52]And then the moon sauce.
[83:05.76]We're going to go right in the middle here.
[83:14.52]This Miku, um, whatever, Miku branded.
[83:18.45]Okay.
[83:20.69]And then this.
[83:21.49]And then this.
[83:25.31]Look at that.
[83:28.03]And that's it.
[83:48.75]That's a full hundred.
[83:51.07]Cool.
[83:53.21]Okay, now let's do something dumb.
[84:02.12]Cake.
[84:07.88]Lemonade.
[84:10.68]Lightly blended.
[84:15.73]And then strawberry whipped cream.
[84:22.94]Can't add any more strawberry.
[84:24.14]Wait, I can.
[84:24.58]Alright.
[84:25.32]No, I can't.
[84:26.08]Okay.
[84:32.20]Then sprinkles.
[84:36.08]And this has to be a joke how much sprinkles are on it.
[84:39.00]How many can you actually put?
[85:00.91]A lot?
[85:01.39]How much is a lot?
[85:06.47]Skip two hours?
[85:08.60]VOD watchers?
[85:14.50]It's unlimited?
[85:45.12]I don't think this is... I think it's replacing them at some point.
[85:56.21]I don't even think it's... I think it's just kind of coloring over them.
[85:58.99]Okay.
[86:21.17]A little too much on the toppings, but that's alright Alright last one It's gonna be called the triple strawberry
[86:43.89]Oh, guys, we're making a triple strawberry.
[86:46.14]Look.
[87:25.11]Okay, I need to, there needs to be like, ace, king, king, ace, two.
[87:30.58]I want it to be like, card themed or something.
[87:41.12]That was fun.
[87:49.51]That would be a goofy ass shake.
[87:54.25]Cool!
[88:00.12]It's payday.
[88:00.74]Let's go.
[88:06.10]A large cup has been... That's my favorite dessert ever.
[88:12.52]People sleep on s'mores so much, and it's infuriating to me.
[88:19.11]Like, that is the greatest kind of dessert.
[88:21.09]It is.
[88:21.37]People just sleep on it.
[88:22.25]It's, like, so hard to... It's annoying to me.
[88:30.07]Okay, this is a large.
[88:33.93]This is a large s'mores.
[88:36.95]Ooh.
[88:39.27]That's probably so good.
[88:40.43]S'mores are amazing.
[88:50.76]I mean, I get it.
[88:53.50]S'mores are a pain in the ass to make.
[88:56.68]They're kind of messy and they're kind of annoying.
[88:59.18]But I think they're the best dessert.
[89:01.17]One of the best at least.
[89:01.93]Especially fresh.
[89:03.93]That is a medium.
[89:14.84]Uh, blueberry.
[89:23.52]I made s'mores in my dorm room with a candle.
[89:28.56]Dude, you gotta be careful, man.
[89:31.03]With a candle?
[89:34.57]Come on.
[89:35.97]Why?
[89:36.49]Alright, wait, don't distract me.
[89:38.41]This is important.
[89:42.05]I'll take your order in a second.
[89:42.99]We gotta do this one.
[89:53.75]Peanuts.
[89:54.21]Alright, you lost me with the peanuts.
[89:56.65]Everything else here is perfect.
[90:14.59]S'mores.
[90:16.43]I gotta take an order here in a second, but I don't want this to overblend.
[90:19.51]Go ahead and do this.
[90:27.03]No, no.
[90:27.63]Honestly, peanuts... I feel like that's very divided.
[90:31.41]I think a lot of people really don't like nuts on their dessert.
[90:40.83]Oh my goodness.
[90:41.95]Hold on.
[90:47.10]You want a tropical tree?
[90:48.06]You want the hard shit?
[90:48.86]Alright, hold on.
[90:49.52]I gotta... And this got all screwed up.
[90:51.92]Why did you move this?
[90:59.23]Blueberries.
[91:01.35]This looks kind of good.
[91:03.43]Blueberry cream is really good.
[91:12.13]Pecans are literally the only S tier ice cream topping.
[91:14.79]I, no, no, I disagree.
[91:18.49]Alright, what is this tropical treat?
[91:28.87]It's blueberry lemonade.
[91:31.79]Is this a large or a small?
[91:33.33]Medium.
[91:34.99]Blueberry lemonade.
[91:42.90]that thing up there this is the drop I'm gonna separate these any nuts really I don't really like on ice cream alright this is a medium driver banana good combo
[92:11.27]I kind of did these two close to each other, I think, because I'm going to mess it up.
[92:14.33]But we'll try to get this one fast.
[92:21.91]So I need blue whipped cream, blue sauce.
[92:30.40]Blue whipped cream.
[92:32.42]Blue sauce.
[92:33.58]Wait, wrong one.
[92:38.26]Coconut sprinkles.
[92:41.73]Go!
[92:42.69]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[92:47.43]There's so much shit on this one.
[92:51.23]Alright, hurry up!
[93:00.92]Hurry up!
[93:02.72]Just in time!
[93:05.92]Uh-oh.
[93:07.60]Um... Uh-oh.
[93:10.25]Oh, shit.
[93:10.77]How do I... What just happened?
[93:12.85]Where's the other one?
[93:15.33]Which one is this?
[93:16.87]Okay, I need this.
[93:17.95]Which one is this one?
[93:22.74]What just happened?
[93:23.18]Okay...
[93:35.14]It's in the queue.
[93:37.70]Alright, good.
[93:48.76]Pretty bad, but it's alright.
[93:58.42]Good, it was an easy one.
[94:02.78]Placement's pretty dogshit on that, but it's alright.
[94:10.27]What's my favorite topping?
[94:13.35]Is it weird that I can't answer that because I haven't had an ice cream like this in a very long time?
[94:18.93]I forgot what all this tastes like.
[94:20.09]I like blended up Oreo cookie.
[94:25.55]Cookies and cream is one of my favorites.
[94:27.37]But that's not really a topping.
[94:33.67]Customer cravings.
[94:35.09]I got six tickets.
[94:38.03]What does...
[94:39.92]I don't know.
[94:41.58]I think it's this one.
[94:42.26]I have to remember orders?
[94:45.80]What does Marty crave?
[94:54.42]Um... I don't know.
[94:58.17]We haven't even served him.
[94:59.03]This is a new item.
[95:00.37]Oh, I got a...
[95:10.87]New flooring.
[95:16.46]What does Mitch crave?
[95:18.72]I'm pretty sure it's this one.
[95:20.58]I think Mitch orders the blue whipped cream.
[95:31.01]I believe this is s'mores over here.
[95:32.49]And this is Oreo cookie over here.
[95:36.05]I got this.
[95:47.88]Yep, this is you like this, and you want this.
[95:53.13]There's usually a ton of stuff on... He's cheating?
[95:56.53]There's not even enough time for you to tell me who did it.
[95:58.29]There's a delay on this to the stream.
[95:59.79]Alright, you... It's... Wait, who is this one?
[96:07.56]You want one of these.
[96:08.28]I think it's this one here.
[96:12.35]So I missed one.
[96:13.55]Oh no.
[96:13.87]What was that?
[96:23.00]Belt?
[96:26.62]Alright, that's better.
[96:34.62]I got a bunch of new furniture.
[96:52.06]This place fucking sucks.
[97:07.11]I get points for these being here though.
[97:31.52]ugly I don't even know what to do with this maybe put this in the very beginning like oh look checkpoint you've made it into the yeah I could do some really wow yeah oh checkpoint you made it into the restaurant so here you are you've made it I think that's like a funny little cute thing to have the front door checkpoint they walk by it and it goes like
[98:04.28]That should tie them over a little bit when they get to like the 50 person line and they forget to have looked at the Yelp score for this restaurant and it's like a two out of fucking five.
[98:13.97]Bring bring look come on in.
[98:33.70]why are you so patronizing and why did I just go like this I'm definitely getting older I just and you know I can just tell

[99:03.30]I'm getting old... My voice is turning into an old guy voice.
[99:05.70]It just is.
[99:07.36]And I'm okay with it.
[99:08.10]I really don't care.
[99:08.82]Uh, strawberry.

[99:49.68]Okay, now... Now I'll put it up.
[99:58.63]Come on in.
[100:01.23]Why are you so patronizing?
[100:03.77]Bring... Oh, welcome!
[100:08.73]Patronizing?
[100:09.69]Who?
[100:10.75]Who am I patronizing with that?
[100:12.47]I've never seen a Mario checkpoint flag at the beginning of any restaurant.
[100:18.18]This is not a real place.
[100:20.22]Alright.
[100:21.06]Hold on.
[100:22.24]What was it?
[100:22.58]Was it large?
[100:28.00]Check the blend.
[100:28.63]This is why I always got to check the goddamn blend first before I do anything.
[100:51.92]Hey, go, go, go, go, go.
[100:54.90]No, that was wrong.
[100:58.22]He didn't blend alarm.
[101:05.19]I need to focus.
[101:08.37]I didn't even.
[101:08.93]Why did I just do that?
[101:12.29]Take it off.
[101:16.17]What the hell do you want?
[101:22.22]Okay.
[101:24.16]And this.
[101:29.67]I gotta start styling it up a little more like that.
[101:31.41]That's like cool.
[101:34.77]Peanuts on the left.
[101:36.87]The dunk.
[101:38.93]I just blended it a little too much.
[101:53.21]Alright, this is a large and you wanted Reese's.
[101:58.43]Chocolate.
[102:00.78]Get this on a blender.
[102:02.84]We need a tropical treat.
[102:04.24]Tropical treat, I believe, is medium, right?
[102:06.94]Yep.
[102:09.92]Food critic has arrived.
[102:13.90]Okay.
[102:15.86]I don't care about anybody else's order.
[102:20.34]This is a medium.
[102:22.87]No, wait, this is a test.
[102:27.15]Sorry, it's true, you're gonna have to wait.
[102:32.69]Oh, he waited, he's making me wait.
[102:33.93]There's another customer, okay.
[102:37.87]Strawberry.
[102:38.61]Get this up.
[102:44.48]Is this the critics?
[102:45.86]Which one is this?
[102:46.38]This one here, okay.
[102:47.54]I'm gonna wait till this is ready, although I'll start to blend on this one, it's a medium.
[102:53.74]Cake and chocolate.
[102:57.20]Perfect.
[103:01.84]Perfect.
[103:08.58]Put it up there.

[104:11.55]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[104:12.35]No!
[104:15.94]Hey, hey, can you come back tomorrow?
[104:20.69]No, honestly, at this point, I'm sorry.
[104:22.93]At this point, I have a stuffed squirrel in the back, like a stuffed animal squirrel.
[104:27.37]And I just run out, holding it against my neck, like, God!
[104:32.24]Squirrel!
[104:33.38]And pump, like, fucking squirrel, like, the sound effects through the PA.
[104:39.52]I'm sorry, you're gonna come back tomorrow.
[104:44.74]Jim Carrey routine.
[104:46.52]Yeah, but I mean, at some point, I gotta, I gotta check the business here.
[104:53.01]Make another one?
[104:53.69]He's been waiting for too long already.
[104:55.11]No, I can't.
[105:07.25]This is fine.
[105:07.95]It's a little blended, but who cares?
[105:13.04]We got the blue ribbon.
[105:13.76]We're fine.
[105:16.38]But there would be a squirrel in your restaurant.
[105:17.92]Wouldn't that be worse?
[105:23.03]No, dude.
[105:23.55]You have to plan it.
[105:25.32]So I have to come out to the... Alright, I've got to come out to the lobby.
[105:30.19]be like, oh, just checking to make sure everyone's doing alright.
[105:32.85]God, it's a little stuffy in here.
[105:35.68]And I open up one of the windows, like, and I have somebody throw the stuffed animal squirrel through the window, and I grab it, holding my neck with it, and start running around in a circle.
[106:05.66]Hold on, let me 100% this real quick.
[106:19.73]That sounds like a Disney Channel sitcom.
[106:26.00]Yeah, it does.
[106:29.60]Are we sure that didn't happen on, like, Suite Life on Deck?
[106:33.00]That may have ar- That may have happened.
[106:35.92]That actually might be a plot from that show.
[106:49.82]Shit.
[106:50.34]God damn, this is hard.
[107:12.78]Did I actually get one?
[107:13.46]I got one.
[107:20.70]Alright.
[107:25.70]Chunky alarm.
[107:26.34]Set this alarm for when sundaes are blended to chunky.
[107:32.94]Hold down the booster to blend sundaes faster.
[107:35.32]That's kind of good.
[107:39.48]I feel like it's this one because most of them are coming through like this.
[107:47.89]Okay.
[107:49.69]And then maybe the first level of this, I can speed it up.
[107:53.65]Okay.
[107:59.40]And then send one to a specific customer to get them to visit again.
[108:08.56]Um, I'll get these two.
[108:11.16]Why not?
[108:14.43]Alright, let's go.
[108:16.61]So I'm imagining those are just installed, right?
[108:23.54]Now celebrating Starlight Jubilee.
[108:27.30]New customer, Boomer.
[108:31.48]Pomegranate.
[108:36.11]Mulberry Medley?
[108:38.66]What's that?
[108:39.59]Ooh, alright.
[108:40.57]What even is that?
[108:42.83]Is this medium?
[108:43.13]That's bad.
[108:43.37]Throw it away quick.
[109:11.84]Alright, what if this thing is?
[109:13.26]Hold down to boost button.
[109:31.41]Oreo cookie, strawberry, chocolate.
[109:32.79]That's... I guess it's not that bad.
[109:42.22]I have the alarm set, right?
[109:47.62]I have a blend alarm.
[109:53.41]Okay, yeah, there's the alarm.
[109:55.41]Speed this up.
[110:11.48]Alright, good.
[110:14.16]What is the max level in this game anyways?
[110:15.56]And then pomegranate shakes.
[110:24.03]Those pomegranate seeds I would want on ice cream.
[110:28.15]I feel like that'd be kind of annoying.
[110:42.69]I can do it quick.
[110:51.84]Good.
[110:53.58]Okay, you wanted this.
[110:56.72]Some syrup on there.
[111:00.78]Get some nuts on there.
[111:06.09]Chocolate chips, and then... almost good, uh...
[111:13.89]Max level is 100.
[111:14.39]Good to know.
[111:22.06]They give extra tips today.
[111:23.06]It's almost 10 bucks.
[111:27.90]Do I have anything blending yet?
[111:32.52]What did you want?
[111:32.96]Okay, alright, alright.
[111:33.70]We got two mediums.
[111:37.01]Get them up there.
[111:38.95]Want these, um...
[111:41.80]I don't even know what these are supposed to be.
[111:43.84]They're supposed to be like Mike and Ike's.
[111:55.79]This is blueberry strawberry.
[111:58.37]Where's my comedy milkshake?
[112:08.46]Oh, you missed it.
[112:08.90]I did it in the food truck.
[112:17.01]That was the wrong syrup.
[112:20.19]What?
[112:23.44]Wrong?
[112:45.97]It's lemonade, not strawberry.
[112:50.11]Pink pomegranate.
[112:51.17]Okay, cool.
[112:51.67]It's the fun.
[112:53.94]A large Reese's chocolate.
[112:58.74]Ah, this is not a bad one.
[112:59.52]This is easy.
[113:04.02]Okay, that's a tropical treat.
[113:06.64]I gotta hurry up with this one.
[113:07.75]Oh, right.
[113:08.59]I screwed it up.
[113:09.43]It's fine.
[113:17.65]Large?
[113:18.27]Alright.
[113:21.07]It's Reese's.
[113:21.79]It's Reese's.
[113:23.41]Oh, alright.
[113:25.55]Let's go.
[113:27.88]Banana cake.
[113:45.06]Banana cake strawberry.
[113:47.87]How's that not perfect?
[113:55.90]This is tropical one, right?
[113:57.44]Alright, what is this?
[114:01.22]Okay, it's whipped cream, coconut syrup, and then sprinkles.
[114:14.93]Good.
[114:18.11]They had to wait a long time, but it's alright.
[114:23.74]We should be fine.
[114:25.30]And then this.
[114:31.10]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[114:37.57]Not bad.
[114:48.03]Um, how close is this one?
[114:49.63]Alright, just get it off.
[114:54.54]Who's been waiting longer?
[114:55.34]You have.
[114:55.70]Okay, let's go.
[115:03.08]Oreo.
[115:04.44]Carry Oreo.
[115:08.51]That was a tuber reaction.
[115:21.26]Alright, whipped cream.
[115:27.16]Nothing but just toppings, alright.
[115:29.68]Toppings!
[115:31.38]I hate that word.
[115:32.10]Ooh, toppings.
[115:34.90]Something about it.
[115:37.28]I just don't like it.
[115:55.25]Toppings.
[116:03.07]Hey, those of you criticizing that I'm not playing the game right, I've got a 98% service quality right now.
[116:09.80]I'm doing pretty fine right now.
[116:33.63]What's going on here?
[116:34.91]Wait, I don't have to use them all?
[116:37.41]What's going on here?
[116:39.49]I thought I had to use all the pieces.
[116:55.16]What is actually going on right now?
[116:56.60]I'm confused.
[116:57.18]What does it want me to do?
[117:00.04]I don't understand.
[117:14.58]Wait, really?
[117:16.90]Wait, what's going on right now?
[117:20.94]I have to... What the hell was that?
[117:32.45]Performance IQ.
[117:33.75]No, dude, I didn't know... They don't give you very much time to be like, oh, by the way, you have to connect everything.
[117:41.54]Good luck.
[117:47.66]We're closing the matches the holiday.
[117:50.54]This dude is stoned.
[117:51.54]I am not stoned right now.
[117:53.84]I am fucking fine.
[117:56.94]Oh, fucking.
[117:57.86]I'm going to.
[117:58.30]No more swearing.
[117:58.88]Check this out.
[118:07.95]Oh, there's this popsicle.
[118:09.07]Oh, that's gross.
[118:29.10]Medium?
[118:30.42]Wait, are we wearing the right clothes?
[118:31.52]Can we change?
[118:33.40]I can't change.
[118:46.37]And then go like this.
[118:52.58]Go like this.
[118:53.12]Put it up there.
[118:56.20]Okay.
[119:12.95]This game just makes me want to go to Sonic.
[119:16.87]I feel like that's where you get stuff like this nowadays.
[119:19.85]Alright, this one's almost there, but I can take one other one.
[119:50.90]What's wrong with it?
[119:53.06]How did I do that?
[120:09.64]This thing is huge.
[120:10.72]S'mores?
[120:11.88]Strawberry?
[120:12.72]This person is going to shit their pants.
[120:18.45]I'm not supposed to be swearing.
[120:21.97]Alright.
[120:30.59]Let me get back to this.
[120:34.04]This one is this one.
[120:35.80]This one is... No, this one's this one.
[120:39.30]This one.
[120:40.30]This one.
[120:41.24]This one.
[120:41.70]This has to speed up before I put anything else on.
[120:44.92]Ow.
[121:19.88]Do a poll.
[121:20.40]We should bet to see if you won't square for 30 minutes.
[121:24.06]Um, yeah, you can bet if you want.
[121:25.24]I'll try.
[121:25.48]I actually will try.
[121:26.16]Should I make sure to tell this guy that there's no returns?
[121:39.17]You know what I mean?
[121:40.81]I want you to understand you know what you're ordering.
[121:42.51]There are no returns or anything, right, dude?
[121:44.46]Like, just make sure this person's well aware of this.
[121:57.54]This guy doesn't walk back in here in five minutes and go, Hey, man, this thing was gross.
[122:03.20]Yeah.
[122:05.26]I know.
[122:05.56]This person's been waiting.

[124:19.30]What?
[124:19.94]What did I say?
[124:23.22]Did I say something?
[124:27.02]What did I say?
[124:27.74]I don't even remember.
[124:32.07]Oops.

[124:34.31]Alright, you can trust me now.
[124:44.80]I promise.
[124:49.02]You can trust me.

[124:53.58]I don't even know what this person ordered.

[125:01.04]I am hand cranky.

[125:54.70]Wait, wrong.
[126:04.88]Not a bad day.
[126:05.54]Alright, timer starts now.
[126:11.28]30 minutes from now.
[126:11.76]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[126:14.32]There's not very many people that believe in me.
[126:17.88]But we'll just prove them all wrong right now.
[126:21.81]I know that those of you that lost everything on shrine bets in Breath of the Wild, now is the time for you to make it all back.
[126:30.01]I would have gone all in on yes.
[126:31.77]That I can not swear for 30 minutes.
[126:34.47]I would have gone all in.
[126:37.42]Believe in me this time.
[126:45.82]I have a question with the committee here that's going to be judging this.
[126:50.72]If it's allowed on regular TV.
[126:57.27]Is that allowed?
[127:05.57]No.
[127:08.81]So, okay, where's the line then?
[127:11.69]Where's the line?
[127:15.82]If I were to say, oh, like a children's birthday party.
[127:20.32]Okay.
[127:21.24]So what?
[127:22.20]Oh, what the heck?
[127:24.02]Oh, dang it.
[127:25.48]That's okay, right?
[127:31.84]Those are okay.
[127:34.49]Okay.
[127:34.93]So just pretend that I'm at a children's birthday party.
[127:38.25]Okay.
[127:48.35]I almost swore right there.
[127:57.29]Why do you get to be in the front?
[128:02.70]This is dangerous too.
[128:11.56]One dollar?
[128:12.10]Alright, I'm being a no.
[128:24.18]We all can't collect the same coin.
[128:33.28]Yep, there it is.
[128:34.15]Alright, we're good.
[128:40.73]Finally.
[128:41.11]Ooh.
[128:47.05]What was that?
[128:52.87]Oh, cool.
[128:53.27]Alright.
[128:53.91]Keep that.
[128:58.73]Oh, don't I have to dress up as, um... We have to dress in certain outfits, don't we?
[129:19.38]Does that matter?
[129:19.88]I don't think that matters.
[129:27.04]This is a Facebook game?
[129:27.92]This is a game on Steam.
[129:32.56]You need to be the family-friendly version of Die Hard that airs on ABC.
[129:35.85]Okay, I can handle that.
[129:44.24]I mean, we've already talked about it, but I...
[129:48.16]When they did that joke in Mr. Show, Bob Odenkirk and... Why can I not think of his name?
[129:59.51]They were a comedy duo.
[130:01.34]David Cross.
[130:01.82]Yeah, there it is.
[130:04.24]I'm going to pause this because it's important.
[130:05.92]They did that bit where it was kind of like a Sopranos-like that was airing on regular kind of just cable television.
[130:13.31]And it was, oh, whatever, the Sopranos parody, whatever it is, brought to you with lots of... What?
[130:20.44]It's not paused?
[130:25.28]Okay.
[130:27.28]They need to do a bunch of edits, so it was edited for television.
[130:29.72]That's just so funny.
[130:32.58]There's only like two minutes of footage in like a 30-minute episode.
[130:37.08]Was it Mr. Show or Mad TV?
[130:39.04]That was Mad TV.
[130:40.09]That was Mr. Show?
[130:41.67]That was Mr. Show as well.
[130:45.81]It was Mr. Show.
[130:46.55]It was on Mr. Show first.
[130:47.43]Just want to make sure you understand that.
[130:54.54]Just in case, we just make sure this is really clear.
[130:56.04]It was on Mr. Show first.
[130:57.86]Let's clear the air here.
[131:01.04]Oops.
[131:06.51]They are waiting.
[131:07.45]Cool, dude.
[131:08.17]Whatever.
[131:08.73]Cool story.
[131:10.71]You're trying to get me to say a bad word.
[131:12.58]And it's not gonna happen.
[131:30.57]These are both mediums, right?
[131:38.09]This is the large.
[131:38.99]Did I get this right?
[131:39.81]Okay, this is the large.
[131:40.61]We've got two mediums.
[131:42.59]This one is Oreo and strawberry.
[131:55.80]And then this is a medium as well.
[132:02.23]Holy smokes.
[132:07.77]You're not winning.
[132:08.33]I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[132:10.03]You're not going to win.
[132:10.95]I'm going to make you, I'm going to put you on the edge of your seat the whole entire 30 minutes.
[132:25.49]Barberry.
[132:28.51]Plum.
[132:29.09]Pomegranate.
[132:32.09]Whatever.
[132:33.17]I almost just got angry.
[132:34.21]I just have to not be mad at random stuff and I'll be fine.
[132:47.16]Somebody at the counter?
[132:47.90]I got it.
[133:04.06]Do I even have that?
[133:05.84]There's rocket whipped cream now?
[133:10.62]What?
[133:13.38]There's rocket whipped cream?
[133:15.81]What does this taste like?
[133:34.87]You got that wrong?
[133:39.23]You put so much... stuff in there, you wouldn't... how would you even tell the difference?
[133:45.60]I would like a tropical treat, please!
[133:47.36]Alright, these are... this is medium, medium, medium.
[133:52.58]Three mediums, immediately.
[133:57.22]How long have you been listening to the same Papa's Freezeria music?
[134:03.42]I mean, what are you, are you telling me to turn this down and put on the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack?
[134:10.47]Is that what you're asking?
[134:11.31]Because that's what it sounds like.
[134:18.77]And then this is Strawberry.
[134:31.68]Is that gross?
[134:32.86]That's kind of gross, isn't it?
[134:33.68]I don't care.
[134:43.49]Dude, do you even G-A-F?
[134:46.49]Uh-huh.
[134:46.85]Do I give a... Do I give a... Is that what you're saying?
[134:53.95]The medium.
[134:56.47]And it is...
[135:06.92]This one's not even on here yet.
[135:08.26]I gotta speed this up.
[135:09.02]We'll do this one.
[135:10.32]And... Okay, this is medium.
[135:13.16]What is in this stuff?
[135:17.74]Uh-oh!
[135:19.84]Which one is this one?
[135:21.36]I'm... I'm... I'm actually... I'm actually really messed up right now.
[135:26.40]I gotta slow down.
[135:27.34]Just wait till these are... Put these in queue.
[135:31.43]Do this one first?
[135:32.95]That's not even right.
[135:34.59]What's even in here?
[135:38.38]Is this this one?
[135:40.26]I don't know which one this is.
[135:44.26]I think this is the right one.
[135:46.16]No, what?
[135:46.75]No, it's this one.
[135:48.23]Whose is this?
[135:48.99]This isn't, this is not, what is this?
[136:16.68]It doesn't matter.
[136:17.78]Look, I have to just pay way more attention than I am right now.
[136:25.92]What's this one?
[136:26.48]Uh, somebody's been waiting for that tropical treat for a whole day.
[136:32.37]Okay, I got it.
[136:34.39]It's a medium, right?
[136:38.07]Medium.
[136:40.16]um I have to get this going peanuts chocolate chips there's so much stuff on here you you're not even gonna taste half of this
[137:05.51]And you want a cookie, and you want a cookie, and you want a, you want all cookies.
[137:15.94]You want every cookie we have.
[137:17.32]Strawberry.
[137:35.58]Sprinkles.
[137:37.40]And then... Alright, I think we're fine.
[137:51.92]Zero tip.
[137:52.58]Alright, I apologize.
[137:58.93]And then it's coconut sprinkles.
[138:06.51]This one looks kind of good.
[138:15.75]It was going so well too.
[138:18.71]That really annoys me.
[138:21.37]How was that wrong?
[138:24.30]It was wrong?
[138:50.20]Okay, give me a sec.
[138:57.20]Just making a quick change here on the soundtrack.
[139:03.09]Get that Twinsons Odyssey up there.
[139:04.55]Why not?
[139:06.27]Let's live a little.
[139:22.48]What about Doom OST?
[139:24.78]Hmm, you're gonna have to wait.
[139:26.38]Let me get through this first.
[139:42.22]Fingerless gloves?
[139:46.96]That feels... I don't know.
[139:48.76]Fingerless gloves at a restaurant?
[139:53.07]To me, it would almost be... I don't know.
[139:55.79]If I saw someone with fingerless gloves, I'd be like, why are you wearing gloves in the first place?
[140:00.91]I just don't even wear them.
[140:06.12]Right?
[140:06.34]I mean... Is that lore?
[140:24.00]It's about the look.
[140:31.17]What does this mean?
[140:32.29]You're built like the bottom of a table in Chili's.
[140:36.77]I don't know what that means, but I don't know if that was like an insult or it could have been.
[140:40.41]But what does that mean?
[140:47.78]Oh my God, he is.
[140:49.02]But I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[140:50.46]Alright.
[140:54.79]Oh, right.
[140:55.15]I was going to do this.
[141:01.00]Get our own music in here.
[141:02.48]Not that the Papa's music is bad or anything.
[141:08.38]Let's go.
[141:12.80]Let's go.
[141:16.70]Should I buy something?
[141:27.66]Pizza Tower OST.
[141:29.04]We'll do that next.
[141:29.54]That sounds good to me.
[141:36.46]Booster 2?
[141:37.06]This is pretty good anti-swear music.
[141:43.95]Yes, it is.
[141:49.75]Why would I swear to this?
[142:11.63]Hey, it's my birthday in a few months.
[142:18.91]Can you swear right now for it?
[142:21.73]You don't ask for a birthday present that far out.
[142:23.73]It's a little too far out, I think.
[142:31.45]I think within 30 days is reasonable though.
[142:58.27]Alright.
[142:59.07]No more birthday stuff.
[143:00.79]How much time do I have before I can speak?
[143:03.37]14 minutes?
[143:03.79]Okay.
[143:07.61]I'm running, running right now.
[143:08.33]Alright.
[143:09.03]Let me get this out pretty quickly.
[143:11.53]This is this one.
[143:16.88]Medium fudge brownie moon.
[143:19.10]Sounds good.
[143:34.43]Ooh, this looks good.
[144:01.61]Alright, where's this ice cream that's gone?
[144:05.54]Where's this ice cream?
[144:06.26]What happened to the ice cream?
[144:10.68]Oh.
[144:19.31]Thank goodness it's easy.
[144:44.31]This one's pretty easy.
[144:44.89]Ah, now we slow it down a little bit.
[144:49.52]I like this part.
[144:58.53]You play with such little urgency, it infuriates me.
[145:02.17]Um... Well...
[145:13.99]How is this not urgency?
[145:16.33]I'm being very urgent.
[145:17.29]I'm just not effective.
[145:18.47]Okay.
[145:33.26]Calypso Island coconuts.
[145:35.96]What's that?
[145:46.78]That's a medium.
[145:51.41]That's a volume.
[145:51.95]Volume good.
[145:52.35]Let's see if I can do this one by just memory.
[145:56.39]I believe it is.
[145:57.17]I don't know.
[145:57.51]I can't do it.
[146:01.55]Okay.
[146:14.68]Lots of mediums.
[146:21.25]Okay, let's go.
[146:21.91]Medium.
[146:23.28]This is Oreo.
[146:28.36]Chocolate.
[146:30.14]Good.
[146:30.38]Get it up there.
[146:31.86]Alarm.
[146:32.50]Spin.
[146:40.17]Avoiding speaking is cheating.
[146:41.49]I've been talking this whole time.
[146:42.91]Okay, I need... What?
[146:49.51]What's going on?
[146:54.86]Coconut syrup.
[147:03.55]How much time do I have?
[147:13.99]The music is ominous.
[147:14.95]It's alright.
[147:33.09]Uhhh... Ummm...
[147:55.59]This one is... This one.
[148:03.21]And white chocolate syrup.
[148:08.49]And peanuts.
[148:14.16]And cherry.
[148:16.96]And then get the heck out of here!
[148:41.08]I can see this one.
[148:41.74]This one looks pretty good.
[148:54.00]You should play Peglin.
[148:56.40]That's actually been on the list for a long time.
[149:02.21]Peglin's been on the list.
[149:03.13]I just haven't played it.
[149:15.85]Blender Ball.
[149:16.47]Alright, let me get this one right.
[149:22.73]Is that not high enough?
[149:25.05]No, I got it.
[149:27.63]The shoes?
[149:39.92]Ooh, gold tile.
[149:41.30]Let's check it out.
[149:41.84]I almost just said a bad word.
[150:06.92]I like that.
[150:11.06]Everything is a little too ugly at the moment.
[150:12.44]That looks a lot better.
[150:21.85]Trying some money with replay.
[150:27.17]Oh, let me change this.
[150:28.49]Let me change the special.
[150:34.30]Pink pomegranate.
[150:35.14]We'll try that.
[150:36.86]Oh, what about this one?
[150:38.44]This one's much less complicated.
[150:46.85]Time, six minutes left.
[150:54.48]Star sprinkles.
[151:01.55]What's the next infomercial stream?
[151:03.19]Well, tomorrow we are watching 90s ads, so I think that's part of, kind of fills that, doesn't it?
[151:08.69]Alright, large, let's go.
[151:19.82]Strawberry chocolate.
[151:29.47]And then this is whipped cream, plum, star sprinkles.
[151:36.16]And the auto carrot is well tomorrow.
[151:38.06]That's right.
[151:45.05]S'more, strawberry, larch.
[151:59.12]Now it's more first, right?
[152:01.58]Does it matter?
[152:03.54]It does.
[152:03.86]This is the right one, right?
[152:18.19]Yeah.
[152:25.66]Those are cool.
[152:30.84]Okay, how we doing?
[152:35.77]Did you swear?
[152:36.27]No, I didn't.
[152:47.79]When?
[152:51.71]You're full of baloney.
[152:56.15]This one goes hard, by the way.
[153:16.01]I didn't say anything bad.
[153:17.03]What?
[153:20.19]What did I say is where?
[153:29.02]You... I said what?
[153:34.41]We need a clip.
[153:36.67]We need a clip.
[153:37.21]I need a... I need a clip.
[153:42.51]You're trying to get me to say that in chat because you're trying to make me believe I already said it and I already lost.
[153:51.74]Wait, you're confusing me.
[153:53.14]Hold on.
[153:53.46]I need two mediums.
[153:56.83]That's a large...
[154:12.61]This one's Cake and Moon.
[154:25.44]Alright, so what's happening here?
[154:26.88]90 seconds left.
[154:32.12]Yeah, you made it up.
[154:34.00]Hey, I don't see a single clip.
[154:37.38]I have not received a clip.
[154:38.50]I have not received a single confirmation of this.
[155:07.12]Don't replace what I was doing Somebody said someone do something I told you to believe you didn't want to Someone do something
[155:42.88]Okay, so where's this clip of me magically saying a bad word?
[155:46.16]Let me see it.
[155:49.38]We got two orders left, huh?
[155:53.38]10 seconds?
[155:59.13]How do I make this?
[156:02.43]This is, is it a medium?
[156:03.69]This is a medium strawberry and two mediums anyways.
[156:14.49]I don't want to lose.
[156:15.45]I can't pause the game.
[156:29.54]Cake and chocolate.
[156:30.72]Let's go.
[156:32.93]Alright, so what is this?
[156:33.85]This is the clip they keep linking, but I don't hear anything.
[156:36.63]You only say bologna.
[156:43.25]What?
[156:47.17]You're full of baloney.
[156:51.59]This one goes hard, by the way.
[156:54.13]I didn't say anything.

[202:29.81]I can't be talking.
[202:30.59]I didn't even put the strawberry in this.
[202:37.39]Okay, this is this one here.
[202:41.26]This one is already over here.
[202:45.82]New topping, whatever that is.
[202:48.78]Atoms?
[202:50.80]Electrons?
[202:51.38]What the hell is this?
[203:01.50]Nerds.
[203:02.14]Oh, okay.
[203:09.89]Good.
[203:12.03]Okay.
[203:12.83]I need a medium.
[203:17.16]With Mike and Ike's and just another, whatever the vanilla I think it is.
[203:23.37]Put that up there.
[203:25.13]Banana butter is in medium.
[203:27.29]Banana and... Yep.
[203:31.22]Okay, whipped cream.
[203:40.21]Let's go.
[203:52.76]I feel like I would really like the taste of these sauces.
[204:08.27]I went to a 100 Gex concert and before the show someone was playing your Breath of the Wild stream on their phone.
[204:12.91]What?
[204:20.39]I didn't even select this.
[204:21.29]Isn't that what I wanted?
[204:23.13]It's banana and Reese's.
[204:42.41]Invite some streamer friends over and make smoothies like this for them.
[204:47.68]Hmm.
[204:49.95]Uh, what?
[204:50.69]What's happening?
[204:51.53]Okay, what is this?
[204:52.51]This was this one?
[204:54.51]What is this one?
[204:55.93]This one here, okay.
[204:56.41]Okay.
[205:08.94]Go on, hurry, please.
[205:10.92]Hurry up.
[205:15.45]There we go.
[205:21.12]That was $294.
[205:22.02]$22 tip.
[205:22.64]What?
[205:23.26]Okay.
[205:38.31]I was impressed by your ability to not cuss.
[205:42.81]Still in there.
[205:48.29]This is...
[205:51.19]Pop there.
[205:52.21]Oh boy, that's a lot.
[205:54.98]Okay.
[205:56.80]This is whipped cream, chocolate, and nuts.
[205:59.14]What kind of whipped cream are... It was nuts, right?
[206:08.11]Yeah, of course.
[206:08.57]It's peanuts.
[206:15.76]Free bananas.
[206:21.83]Hey, can you play Cod Zombies with me?
[206:24.90]I have to go to bed soon.
[206:25.98]Sorry, dude.
[206:36.66]Medium.
[206:39.02]Strawberry.
[206:40.46]Pop.
[206:42.21]Go off.
[206:56.06]Why does this look incorrect?
[206:56.90]Because it is.
[207:10.85]Was it?
[207:11.95]Was that wrong?
[207:15.39]Wait, what's happening?
[207:23.90]Was it correct?
[207:28.22]Hey dude, can you shout out the New York Mets?
[207:32.07]The New York Mets.
[207:34.17]Let's hope that they do a good job this year.
[207:35.89]Let's see some winning games.
[207:40.97]You guys got it in you.
[207:42.37]Let's go New York Mets.
[208:04.45]That was really sweet.
[208:17.70]92.
[208:19.54]Can you shout out the Yankees for me real quick?
[208:23.96]No, that's not happening.
[208:26.82]That's not happening.
[208:29.02]I don't think so.
[208:29.84]I don't think so.
[208:31.02]Ban that guy, actually.
[208:36.44]nah nah sorry that's not happening here nice
[209:07.09]What about the Phillies?
[209:07.99]Yeah!

[209:45.38]Strike them out here, strike them out here!
[209:47.88]Nice.
[209:48.34]Let's go, Twins.
[209:51.36]What about the Yankees?
[209:59.00]Yeah, okay.
[210:01.48]The Yankees, you want me to...
[210:06.43]Get the fuck out of here.
[210:07.79]Get out of here.
[210:10.57]What about the cubs?
[210:14.28]Oh, my cubs!
[210:16.96]Of course.
[210:19.12]Of course I will.
[210:35.48]Don't ever say that again.
[210:55.73]They're driving crazily, I'm not.
[211:02.53]This person is trying to kill me.
[211:03.55]Hey, don't forget who makes your sundaes.
[211:09.32]Yeah.
[211:10.42]Rick, whatever your name is.
[211:13.06]You come in every day and get a sundae.
[211:15.86]You take me out, that's not going to be a good idea.
[211:22.07]Ooh, I like these.
[211:38.84]I need more holiday spirit, right?
[211:51.34]What holiday is this?
[211:53.00]What am I... What's the hol... What I... What holiday am I dressing up for?
[212:06.74]It's the 4th of July?
[212:07.90]Wait, how did we already get back to the 4th of July again?
[212:10.25]It's been a year?
[212:19.60]It's been like 12 days.
[212:20.54]Hell yeah.
[212:39.28]I don't think I've ever had four on it one time.
[212:43.62]But I'm going to get it.
[212:53.90]It's the other 4th of July.
[212:55.32]Oh.
[212:56.68]This town is very patriotic.
[213:12.48]Alright, I'm going to take a beer break.
[213:15.75]We'll do a... I'll come back.
[213:17.69]Just chilling.
[213:20.57]See you guys in a minute.
[213:22.22]I'm going to go refill this drink.
[213:23.52]I'm going to go pee.
[213:25.26]I'll be right back.
[220:14.39]Hello.
[220:19.18]How's it going?
[220:27.60]So I think I might just stick with this.
[220:32.10]There was something else that I was going to play, but I'm having a good time.
[220:49.31]We got House Flipper this weekend, which I'm really looking forward to playing that.
[221:00.80]90s ads tomorrow.
[221:04.92]And I didn't realize I was streaming for four hours already.
[221:11.47]We'll keep going.
[221:18.13]Okay.
[221:18.27]Okay.
[221:20.69]Without music, it's ominous.
[221:30.26]Did I do this?
[221:31.82]No, I have a lot of upgrades now.
[221:38.29]New customer.
[221:44.79]Put on Club Penguin.
[221:46.97]Club Penguin like music?
[221:49.63]Did Club Penguin have a good OST?
[221:51.19]I never played Club Penguin at all.
[222:01.20]70 tracks of Club Penguin.
[222:07.35]This is kind of nice.
[222:13.65]Yeah, I've never played this.
[222:18.54]This kind of fits this game too.
[222:19.86]Oh.
[222:25.58]That's really cool.
[222:28.37]I don't have to pour it anymore.
[222:47.05]Hello?
[222:55.96]Okay, what came out first?
[222:58.90]Club Penguin or World of Warcraft?
[223:03.70]What came out first?
[223:09.98]Did WoW come out first?
[223:12.18]Interesting.
[223:18.89]This is medium.
[223:19.95]Do I have time?
[223:22.67]No, I don't.
[223:33.63]It's just toppings.
[223:37.09]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[223:42.70]Get it out the door.
[223:43.64]It was a year before Club Penguin was 2005.
[223:46.98]Because WoW was 2004?
[223:48.48]2003?
[223:48.50]When was WoW?
[223:57.80]Wait, there was a very early Club Penguin version that might have been first.
[224:00.42]I'm just trying to figure out if it was the... I mean, EverQuest was a really popular MMO.
[224:06.22]But was Club Penguin the first popular MMO?
[224:10.04]How much more popular was Club Penguin than EverQuest?
[224:25.30]I need a large.
[224:28.33]Ultima Online was the first one.
[224:29.97]But I mean like really popular.
[224:32.52]World of Warcraft popped off.
[224:33.84]I feel like Club Penguin popped off big time.
[224:39.66]I'm talking more than a million concurrent players.
[224:42.65]Was EverQuest more than a million concurrent?
[224:44.39]More than five million concurrent?
[224:48.87]Probably RuneScape.
[224:50.03]Probably RuneScape.
[224:50.82]Yeah.
[224:52.84]Alright, uh, hold on.
[224:54.11]This is this one.
[224:56.99]I need that large cup.
[225:05.95]And then I need a medium.
[225:07.93]Okay.
[225:18.70]OK, beat this up, let's go.
[225:21.32]Somebody at the door, right?
[225:22.62]OK, good.
[225:29.80]Coconut, come on, hurry up.
[225:34.50]That's good.
[225:43.97]RuneScape always seemed like a really fun game.
[225:46.77]But for some reason, I always felt like it was a lot to take in.
[225:52.17]I feel the same way about RuneScape that I do about Path of Exile.
[225:57.34]I see clips of it.
[225:58.76]I see people playing it.
[225:59.58]And I see the UI.
[226:00.60]And I see all the shit going on.
[226:01.76]I'm like, hey.
[226:03.60]This looks kind of... Is this complicated?
[226:05.69]I don't know.
[226:05.99]I can't tell.
[226:19.57]I know, I know, I know, I'm going... Try to play RuneScape without the nostalgia.
[226:33.15]RuneScape is pretty simple.
[226:41.87]Does it remind you of Diablo, that's why you want to play it?
[226:46.33]No?
[226:47.45]It just always seemed kind of interesting.
[226:50.93]OK, we're closed.
[226:55.19]Large strawberry chocolate.
[227:00.97]It's pretty scuffed, but it's alright.
[227:07.94]This is medium.
[227:10.18]Yeah.
[227:21.42]Dude, do you even like video games?
[227:26.50]I think so.
[227:42.89]Prove that you do.
[227:45.37]Um...
[227:47.39]I got 150 kills in a row in the mercenary mode.
[227:52.20]That means I kind of like playing video games, doesn't it?
[228:02.82]I like some video games.
[228:16.66]Beat Hades?
[228:17.32]Yeah.
[228:28.06]Whipped cream chocolate.
[228:36.28]Play OSU.
[228:39.38]I feel like I'd be really bad at that game.
[228:44.67]That's a rhythm game, right?
[228:47.69]Rhythm games I do very well, but not if I have to go very, very, very fast.
[228:52.35]I didn't even know this person was here.
[229:11.06]That's right.
[229:19.46]I agree.
[229:19.90]It's better if you're good.
[229:42.51]Uh...
[229:50.81]It depends on the game.
[229:53.58]But yeah, if you play Dark Souls and you lose to the first four enemies 100 times, then it can get kind of frustrating.
[230:14.15]Like you.
[230:14.61]I did not.
[230:18.13]You are changing the record.
[230:26.04]I thought I did a pretty good job.
[230:31.14]On stream.
[230:49.46]How many people do you think actually think you died to Pinwheel?
[230:53.21]probably everybody because why even why would you even argue that why are we dressed exactly the same um that's a weird thing to have to argue like oh hey dude he died at Pinwheel he did yeah oh let me research that no you're probably just gonna go oh he sucks that's funny
[231:28.60]actually watch the VOD the collateral this is propaganda he did actually die to finwheel
[232:08.79]Gotta get a new t-shirt for that one.
[232:16.69]Nice.
[232:26.35]Banana butter berry blast.
[232:27.87]Yep.
[232:40.83]I just took a picture of my sandwich because it looked so good.
[232:44.29]Oh, that's cool.
[232:48.28]That's cool.
[232:51.86]Hazelnut swizzle?
[232:55.30]Tiramisu?
[233:02.17]I can surf tiramisu now?
[233:11.57]You want a tiramisu in your... Wait, what?
[233:19.13]It seems kind of amazing.
[233:22.03]Tiramisu, vanilla paste, whipped cream, and hazelnut.
[233:29.21]That sounds awesome.
[233:31.84]That sounds really good.
[233:41.62]Still gonna do the courthouse stream?
[233:43.50]No.
[233:45.14]That's a long, long time away from... Yeah, that's gone.
[234:00.83]Kiribisu?
[234:01.33]That's how you say it, right?
[234:06.37]I'm saying it right?
[234:14.58]one's easy where are you playing these now there is only one available on Steam at the moment this is papa's frizeria deluxe it's on Steam I don't know what their plans are for the other ones if they do have any plans I don't know but this one is on Steam
[234:46.85]Got a perfect, yeah.
[234:49.56]Alright, this one's going to be done in a second.
[234:55.04]Alright, let's go.
[235:09.59]Chocolate whipped cream.
[235:10.31]You know, one of the games that really... Here's another banger of a game.
[235:16.93]Do you guys remember Hand of Fate?
[235:22.25]That game is awesome.
[235:28.03]I forgot how unbelievably good that game was.
[235:31.10]I feel bad I didn't play it way more.
[235:36.92]There's a second one, yeah.
[235:38.46]There's two.
[235:48.70]I don't know how to make a berry blast, but we're going to try in a second here.
[235:54.80]Medium, and it's blueberry strawberry.
[235:57.04]It was amazing.
[236:01.74]I think the developers went out of business.
[236:03.54]Really?
[236:03.84]Did they really?
[236:07.99]It's such a unique game.
[236:24.95]It's a cookie, right?
[236:35.23]I'd like to see you do a RuneScape stream one day.
[236:37.73]Is RuneScape the kind of game where I would open it and like a thousand people would follow me around and kill me for like the two logs that I have?
[236:46.12]Is that going to happen?
[236:48.94]Probably.
[236:53.41]This is a... Strawberry, right?
[236:59.26]Yep.
[237:06.16]You would be protected.
[237:09.81]They can't kill you, but they will follow you.
[237:33.89]This is what is this one?
[237:36.19]Oh, okay.
[237:36.51]We're good That's very blast.
[237:39.38]This is tiramisu red velvet I made a character on runescrape named jermaWalk and made it look like you a year ago This is a nice song
[238:13.38]Alright, this one's coming up.
[238:17.76]Uh, which one's easier?
[238:18.90]Probably this one.
[238:20.92]No, no, no, no, no.
[238:21.46]This one's harder because I don't know.
[238:23.47]It's alright.
[238:28.43]Cream, cream, cream.
[238:29.45]What was it?
[238:31.47]Cream, cream, cream, cream.
[238:38.86]Cream, cream, cream, cream.
[238:39.64]And there was this cream, this cream.
[238:50.76]and then nerds and then the wafer carry wafer it was the wrong cream I got it okay this one
[239:21.11]I got it right.
[239:27.23]Peanuts.
[239:30.61]And then a cinnamon stick.
[239:46.35]And this is whipped cream, peanuts.
[239:54.96]And then a... cinnamon stick.
[239:59.60]And a cherry.
[239:59.94]And a coffee.
[240:10.97]Are you ever gonna play Pirates of the Caribbean online?
[240:14.13]Years ago we did an MMO night.
[240:16.71]Where we played a bunch of free MMOs.
[240:18.15]And it was kind of a disaster.
[240:24.10]It's like five years ago.
[240:26.67]Long time ago.
[240:33.20]This many years later, I want to say that it would be way harder to do a free MMO stream or free to play MMO stream.
[240:44.36]I think back like five years ago or so, four years, whatever it was.
[240:47.64]I think there were like two or three thousand concurrent viewers here.
[240:51.39]And that was already hard.
[240:53.63]If I did that right now.
[240:54.55]I don't know if that would work.
[240:58.29]It might be hard to do that now.
[241:02.61]It was already hard to do that back then.
[241:13.32]Shit.
[241:15.53]Holdfast?
[241:16.25]Holdfast was a lot of fun.
[241:22.68]Sire, we must do something.
[241:24.54]The enemy is playing copyrighted music at us.
[241:28.39]That's a classic.
[241:33.03]Really?
[241:33.29]How is that not going in?
[241:44.92]A pizzelle?
[241:47.96]They're clowns?
[241:52.46]You're going to play Project Diva again?
[242:06.87]I think I really got most of what I played the hell out of that.
[242:13.04]I did like every song three times.
[242:28.32]What's your favorite Minecraft Steve topping?
[242:31.89]Oh my god!
[242:41.65]My brain only works in one fucking direction.
[242:45.63]That person asked me what my favorite ice cream flavor and topping was and then they did an emote of Minecraft Steve.
[242:51.02]That's the only thing that I could see.
[242:55.00]Whatever.
[243:04.57]Dude, come on.
[243:13.94]Why did I just do this twice?
[243:15.70]Throw it away!
[243:16.90]Throw this in the trash!
[243:31.36]Shit.
[243:33.80]That made me sound so strange.
[243:50.09]Oh, it's one of those cookies.
[243:51.00]I like these.
[243:56.08]Have you watched the new Resident Evil movie trailer?
[244:00.30]No, because, correct me if I'm wrong here, but every Resident Evil movie, all of them, I feel like have been just, like, they're not even Resident Evil movies.
[244:15.11]It's like an AI came up with the story for what a Resident Evil movie might be.
[244:20.01]And I'm not even, I'm not talking like ChatGPT 3 or 4, I'm talking like ChatGPT 1.
[244:26.94]Whatever that technology was.
[244:33.23]I have not paid attention to Resident Evil's movies in at least a decade or two.
[244:38.19]Because they all seem kind of weird.
[244:53.76]Alright, there's people waiting.
[244:57.26]Need a berry blast.
[244:59.00]That's blueberry and strawberry.
[245:00.32]Strawberry.
[245:06.74]They are fun garbage.
[245:10.74]I just haven't even seen... I haven't had any interest in them at all.
[245:17.27]Should I watch them?
[245:20.63]I don't really have... I don't really... There's a lot of movies I think that are going to come in front of that first.
[245:25.11]If I'm honest.
[245:33.66]Watch the CG movies.
[245:35.44]Not the live action ones.
[245:49.81]okay come on perfect timing on this one
[246:04.03]I've got like a paragraph complaint here.
[246:07.31]Mr. Elbertson, if you continue to anger the Steve Jackson Sorcery Enjoyers High Council, your continuing animosity for sorcery angers us.
[246:15.41]If you do not comply, there will be dire consequences.
[246:17.91]You have two months, Mr. Elbertson, to do another stream of the hit adaptation of the Choose Your Own Adventure book, Steve Jackson's Sorcery, created by Inkle Studios.
[246:26.21]The consequences will be severe if you do not comply.
[246:28.03]Sincerely, Steve Jackson Sorcery Enjoyer High Council.
[246:33.83]That's enough time.
[246:34.57]I got two months.
[246:44.70]Okay.
[246:49.50]This one here.
[246:57.65]It's not berry.
[246:59.79]It's... Oh, it's this one.
[247:01.51]Uh-oh.
[247:09.77]What about Tears of the Kingdom?
[247:14.48]I have to finish Breath of the Wild.
[247:16.14]There's no world where I just start playing Tears of the Kingdom when I have one more Guardian to beat in Breath of the Wild.
[247:24.31]You guys would never let me do that.
[247:26.53]I would never let me do that.
[247:38.75]If you don't get to the last hour of a movie that you've been watching, turn the movie off and just play the sequel instead.
[247:46.93]Okay, this is pink, blue, red.
[248:10.52]I haven't had a cotton candy flavored thing in a very long time, and I know exactly what it tastes like, but I forget everything about it.
[248:16.14]Anybody else here get like that?
[248:22.19]Where you almost just want to be reminded of a very specific flavor?
[248:24.79]Because cotton candy flavoring, nothing else is like it on Earth.
[248:30.89]I don't know what concoction of weird chemicals it is, but there's nothing on Earth that it tastes like.
[248:36.67]Only cotton candy flavoring.
[248:53.08]like sugar no no I'm talking cotton candy flavoring the fake cotton candy just like how this fake banana and it does not taste like a banana
[249:14.68]No, you guys get it.
[249:33.67]I do like banana.
[249:34.55]Banana cream pie is my favorite.
[249:35.97]Oh, somebody wanted to ask what my favorite dessert was.
[249:38.20]Did you?
[249:38.46]I don't know.
[249:38.90]Whatever.
[249:40.28]Banana cream pie.
[249:41.72]S'mores.
[249:43.50]Are probably one, two.
[249:45.61]What's the third one?
[249:58.52]I just tasted artificial cotton candy flavoring right now.
[250:02.78]My brain just made me taste it.
[250:05.44]Interesting.
[250:07.18]Yeah.
[250:08.16]Yep, that's exactly what it tastes like.
[250:09.44]I can taste it right now.
[250:13.57]My brain had to go file a bunch of hard drive stuff and find it, but I can taste it.
[250:28.85]Weirdly enough I can taste the slush version Right now I can taste the slush version of a cotton candy slush That's gross
[250:57.21]Why are you still playing this?
[250:58.50]I don't know.
[250:59.08]We're just hanging out.
[250:59.80]Alright, I messed this one up last time.
[251:29.98]Oh wait, I can't bump into it from here.
[251:31.44]I thought I could.
[251:32.47]Oops.
[252:24.41]Got it.
[252:40.86]I didn't want to do that.
[252:41.58]There we go.
[252:48.67]Can't believe this lies.
[252:49.75]Don't forget.
[253:06.94]I will play it.
[253:10.20]I'll play sorcery.
[253:14.73]Okay, you want this chunky.
[253:15.83]A little too much chocolate, though.
[253:21.99]I need something to break that up.
[253:26.78]Way too much.
[253:27.20]Let's get this out quick.
[253:47.06]Play Mega Man Legends 2.
[253:48.16]Uh... Is this done?
[253:51.10]It's not... What's... Okay, why is it... It is done.
[253:57.22]Why did it answer the phone?
[253:58.20]I gotta get ahead of this.
[254:00.29]Not bad.
[254:27.26]I have not seen the Mario movie.
[254:33.68]Although, I very much anticipate seeing it.
[254:35.88]Uh, Berry Blast.
[255:06.48]I watched it today.
[255:07.08]It was epic.
[255:07.72]If you could be a bug, which one would you be?
[255:26.03]What bug lives the longest?
[255:27.07]Because any bug you pick is like you're dead in like fucking four days.
[255:43.03]cockroach lives for how long do they live for they live forever I don't think that's true
[256:14.77]He's so bad at this.
[256:16.13]I've not had a single bad order in maybe three in four and a half hours.
[256:22.94]I've had three bad orders across 200 or 300 orders.
[256:35.94]You don't know what you're talking about.
[257:00.58]Termite Queens live 25 to 50 years.
[257:02.26]That's pretty cool.
[257:10.27]Beetle grubs live in the ground for like 16 years.
[257:15.25]Splendor beetle.
[257:16.83]One of the longest living insects in the world.
[257:19.13]An impressive lifespan that averages 31 years.
[257:22.60]With the longest recorded lifespan reaching 51 years.
[257:25.84]I would want to be a splendor beetle.
[257:40.31]Isn't red velvet just a made-up flavor?
[257:42.59]It's not actually anything.
[257:43.43]It's just chocolate, right?
[257:56.56]Alright, I gotta go place these.
[258:06.92]It's just beets and chocolate.
[258:10.67]supposed to be a cake yeah alright this one's large this one's the medium okay so now you need medium this is strawberry banana they're all medium alright let's go hold this one off
[258:53.28]What is that little thing here?
[258:54.62]A mango or something?
[259:03.88]Oh, come on.
[259:11.82]Shit.
[259:15.44]Oh, that was sloppy.
[259:29.23]Everybody here is ordering these like it's a subway.
[259:34.06]Okay, what do you want on it?
[259:35.06]I guess I'll take, uh, banana peppers, uh, fucking oregano, uh, give me some oil, maybe some vinegar.
[259:41.38]Uh, and maybe, um, you know what?
[259:43.75]Put, like, extra lettuce on it, a tomato.
[259:45.59]Is it- This is all- These orders are all fucked up.
[259:55.44]What kind of cheese do you got?
[259:57.57]Oh, no, I don't care.
[259:58.46]Just put all of them on.
[260:00.56]Just do one slice of every cheese.
[260:06.81]What do we got?
[260:07.17]Cherries?
[260:07.61]Yeah, put one on.
[260:08.29]Cookies too?
[260:09.01]Yeah, fuck it.
[260:10.55]What are those things?
[260:12.03]Alright, it looks cool.
[260:12.73]Put it on.
[260:28.77]Banana peppers and ice cream.
[260:32.79]I love banana peppers.
[260:34.21]They're so good.
[260:40.59]You thinking of Quiznos?
[260:43.61]Quiznos.
[260:44.87]Man.
[260:47.69]I heard a sad tale about Quiznos.
[260:52.93]It's just unfortunate.
[260:56.53]That place was
[260:59.04]Unbelievably good.
[261:00.92]Unbelievably good.
[261:02.82]What the hell happened?
[261:05.32]They made the best sandwiches.
[261:07.90]No one can even come close.
[261:09.89]Every other chain sub shop that I've ever been to, it was so far behind.
[261:15.67]They went literally D and C's to Quiznos' S. No one even comes close.
[261:23.15]I don't want to hear anybody else.
[261:24.51]I don't want to hear any of the other restaurants.
[261:27.15]Nope.
[261:27.75]They don't even come close.
[261:30.58]Honey Bacon Club is the single best chain sandwich I've ever had in my life.
[261:34.90]And it's S plus and nothing is even on A. Nothing is even on A. Some stuff is on B. There's a lot of Bs.
[261:46.67]B pluses.
[261:47.75]Maybe some A minuses, but no.
[261:53.15]You are capping out of your mind.
[261:54.57]It was just as bad as Subway.
[261:56.45]No, no, it was not.
[261:57.99]No way.
[262:00.73]No way.
[262:01.88]Quiznos was so good.
[262:03.22]I'm just guessing.
[262:11.66]It was barely different.
[262:13.78]No, you didn't even eat it.
[262:15.20]I don't think you ate it.
[262:17.40]You probably saw it.
[262:19.36]You probably saw somebody walking around with it.
[262:22.51]Eating it.
[262:23.25]You know what I mean?
[262:23.75]Like the big tube.
[262:24.57]You probably saw somebody eating a tube and you were like, I don't know about that.
[262:27.37]You didn't eat it.
[262:29.87]Did you eat it?
[262:30.25]I don't think you did.
[262:30.89]Did you eat it?
[262:32.95]Did you eat it?
[262:41.00]I'm serious.
[262:44.24]I feel like I love Quiznos and I don't love Subway.
[262:49.34]They're very, very distinct for me.
[262:56.02]Corporate fucked over all the ingredient providers.
[263:00.61]Come on.
[263:02.87]Really?
[263:03.17]Ooh.
[263:14.71]Double points?
[263:17.54]I promise you I ate it.
[263:19.22]Okay.
[263:19.68]Alright.
[263:19.98]I believe you.
[263:22.20]I believe you.
[263:31.96]They jacked up prices in four stores to buy from the suppliers.
[263:34.40]Why can't we just have good yummy sandwiches?
[263:39.18]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[263:40.32]Why can't we just have just delicious sandwiches?
[264:02.40]Just buy a toaster oven, make them at home.
[264:06.55]It's different though.
[264:07.85]I am gonna make a statement here, and I know a lot of people agree with this.
[264:13.73]It doesn't matter what the food is.
[264:15.67]It doesn't matter how much I spend on it, how much time I spend, how quality the, I could buy highest quality ingredients in the world.
[264:23.81]I could go and get, oh, like delicious Wagyu beef, make a Wagyu beef burger on the grill at your house.
[264:32.19]It is never as good as if somebody else makes it for me.
[264:35.65]Always.
[264:36.33]It is never as good.
[264:38.67]I could follow a recipe to a T, take a bite out of it, and go, this sucks.
[264:43.98]I did something wrong.
[264:45.86]When somebody else does the same thing and makes it for me, whether it's a restaurant, it's always better.
[264:52.44]It just always is better than me.
[264:54.12]Way better than me.
[264:56.31]And I've come to accept that.
[264:59.45]Like, you're just doing this way... You just... You're doing something way better than I am.
[265:04.17]So... Yeah.
[265:20.70]Okay, let's get this out.
[265:21.42]I think it's because you're afraid of ovens.
[265:26.88]I still cook with an oven.
[265:39.65]I bet you like unsalted butter.
[265:43.79]In its appropriate places to use it, it should be used.
[265:51.94]How's this?
[265:52.38]This is a weird combo.
[266:01.74]I still haven't made this large.
[266:17.13]None of these are okay.
[266:18.33]This one's this one's done.
[266:25.70]Is this the right one?
[266:27.12]Oh, shut up.
[266:36.06]We ran out of pink whipped cream.
[266:39.16]Sorry.
[266:51.32]There's nothing wrong with unsalted butter.
[266:52.56]I don't know what that... Yeah, what's the deal?
[266:56.63]Uh-oh.
[266:57.17]I'm starting to lose control here.
[266:59.23]This is this one.
[267:00.15]I'm losing control.
[267:06.89]Oh, my goodness.
[267:07.91]I've lost control.
[267:12.33]Strawberries.
[267:12.91]Okay.
[267:13.53]Hurry up.
[267:22.07]Okay, hurry up.
[267:29.08]Really not even that bad for having the wrong whipped cream.
[267:31.46]I love food though.
[267:54.45]I could be having a really bad day.
[267:56.95]And just a nice, delicious meal.
[268:00.38]Just changes everything.
[268:01.38]It really does.
[268:01.84]Are you a good cook?
[268:13.40]No.
[268:15.49]I know how to make a few things.
[268:18.15]That's it.
[268:25.87]I can make a good fish.
[268:27.65]I can make a good salmon in the oven.
[268:29.61]I can make a good, you know, cod in the pan.
[268:42.73]I like fish.
[268:43.17]Fish sandwiches?
[268:45.57]Pretty easy.
[268:57.50]Egg salad?
[268:58.74]Egg salad's not necessarily cooking as much as it's putting something together.
[269:02.86]I mean, I guess technically you are cooking something.
[269:07.02]You cook the eggs.
[269:07.68]You know what?
[269:08.98]I'm going to own that.
[269:09.62]Yeah, it's good.
[269:10.98]My recipe is phenomenal.
[269:13.16]Yeah, I'm going to own that because it's good.
[269:14.62]It's true.
[269:23.79]What is this thing?
[269:24.43]Okay, I need sprinkles.
[269:31.19]There's not been one bad review of that recipe, by the way.
[269:38.49]Okay, coconut... There's been zero reviews.
[269:54.46]There's been at least five or ten.
[270:00.01]There's been at least five or ten.
[270:01.29]Peanuts and then double stick.
[270:02.65]Carry.
[270:03.89]Go.
[270:30.77]What's wrong with this?
[270:32.89]Blended too much?
[270:41.69]Oh my god, I'm scared of it.
[270:43.33]What is this one?
[270:44.01]This one doesn't... I don't even know what that... Okay, let's make two more.
[271:03.56]This is banana.
[271:04.22]Please try.
[271:24.67]Did you get permission to leak the family egg recipe or was it a Prometheus?
[271:30.16]What's that reference to?
[271:49.39]There we go The reference to the Bible
[272:02.84]Sorry, I have not kept up with my Bible studies.
[272:07.06]What is... Prometheus is... Stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.
[272:18.81]He got punished for it.
[272:19.73]I think he had to have his liver eaten by a raven every day.
[272:27.89]Uh... Well, that didn't... That didn't happen.
[272:35.08]Do you mean am I getting a lot of flack from my family for leaking the recipe?
[272:40.54]I think that's where you're going with it, right?
[272:57.24]Ooh, that's a good one.
[273:06.50]Hey, you do know that a secret family recipe can start at any generation.
[273:14.09]Who's to say it didn't start with me?
[273:18.57]You think there's some great dear old great grandma or grandpa that I got that from?
[273:24.55]Could be starting here.
[273:25.97]I am the great grandpa.
[273:28.64]I am the secret recipe.
[273:29.86]You understand?
[273:37.48]Gotta leave something, right?
[273:45.51]I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures of me in chef outfits.
[273:49.91]Just to make sure that there's some, you know, so they can look back and be like, oh, great, great, great, great grandpa Jerma.
[273:54.63]I mean, there's a lot of pictures of him in chef hats.
[273:58.21]He must have been a chef of some kind.
[274:00.49]Why would he take photos like this?
[274:08.68]That one's hard.
[274:09.68]That one was really, really hard.
[274:18.29]There's a ton of green screen footage of you.
[274:21.49]That's fine.
[274:22.73]That was in my younger years.
[274:25.75]I'm gonna take these photos when I'm like 60.
[274:27.17]Oh my goodness.
[274:30.62]What a disaster.
[274:37.79]That was a nice song.
[275:00.51]If I walked in and this is all here, don't you think that the people that were working here were moving?
[275:08.64]Like, oh, it's like this because they're moving soon.
[275:11.20]This is pretty good Kickstarter music.
[275:17.30]What do you mean?
[275:38.55]Mr. Elbertson, this is Steve Jackson's Sorcery Enjoyers High Council.
[275:41.89]That thing got removed in a second.
[275:44.63]You can't post that more than once.
[275:46.50]Although... That doesn't get posted more than once.
[275:51.90]I'm only gonna read that once.
[275:57.67]It was different?
[275:58.87]Oh, oh well.
[276:08.41]You've asked this question like 30 times.
[276:09.99]Do I eat sludge?
[276:13.60]Well, that depends on your definition.
[276:16.82]Is oatmeal sludge?
[276:20.12]Let's break this down and talk about this.
[276:31.54]The answer is yes, then.
[276:54.07]Alright, speed this one up.
[276:58.91]What about slop?
[277:02.16]If sludge is oatmeal, we're considering that oatmeal is thicker.
[277:07.56]Sludge to me is a little thicker.
[277:09.66]Slop is runny.
[277:11.68]What would be runny?
[277:18.53]Chili?
[277:19.83]Mmm.
[277:20.99]Chili might fall more under the sludge category, I think.
[277:28.27]Oh, I need this one.
[277:37.38]And then three cones.
[277:38.80]Are these cones or the waffle?
[277:40.18]What is this?
[277:53.26]Chowder?
[277:55.02]Chowder is kind of slop.
[277:57.14]I could see that.
[277:59.06]I could see how that... You could see that.
[278:02.04]Cannoli?
[278:12.30]There we are.
[278:18.51]The oatmeal depends on consistency, yeah.
[278:23.17]You know what I haven't had in a long time?
[278:25.19]A good fish chowder.
[278:27.11]Clam chowder, F. Fish chowder, A+.
[278:32.19]Corn chowder, B. Clam chowder is an F for me.
[278:37.83]Fish chowder is an S. It's an A+.
[278:45.89]I don't like clams.
[278:49.26]I never was a fan of clams or oysters.
[278:50.98]Anything in the shell, really, besides maybe crab.
[279:01.37]Clams are too rubbery.
[279:02.25]Yeah, I feel like I... I don't like it.
[279:04.79]It's too weird.
[279:12.52]Clams are rubbery.
[279:14.38]No, I don't like squid either, or octopus.
[279:16.78]No, thanks.
[279:20.41]If you're one of those people that goes, hey, let's get a calamari for the table.
[279:26.31]I always kind of feel like, fuck, I'm not going to eat any of that.
[279:29.02]And people are going to be, you're going to be looking over, hey, you want those, you want any pieces?
[279:33.42]There's like five or six pieces of calamari left.
[279:35.96]Like, no, you can eat it.
[279:37.74]Well, I already had like seven or eight pieces.
[279:39.69]I'm not, I want to leave room for my entree.
[279:43.09]Like, oh, no.
[279:52.61]Oops.
[280:01.13]I have eaten calamari before.
[280:03.31]That was very, very, very, very good.
[280:06.45]It was perfect.
[280:08.19]But I've also eaten calamari before that made me want to never eat it ever again for the rest of my life.
[280:13.40]So, I'm sorry, that's too much of a range for me.
[280:18.50]It's just too much of a range.
[280:35.45]Okay, hold on.
[280:40.00]Dude, your stream really is a food podcast.
[280:42.24]I could talk about food all day.
[280:46.90]Don't be surprised if I, like, fucking retire and I have, like, an old man food podcast.
[280:53.91]today where I go and I tried this restaurant today and it was called spaghetti for two or whatever.
[281:02.44]And it was delicious.
[281:03.32]And let me tell you what I ordered.
[281:06.19]Would you watch that?
[281:07.45]Would you listen to it?
[281:13.04]I will say I was not a huge fan of the crust of the bread.
[281:17.14]The crust of the bread to me needs to be brown on the underneath, but soft on the top.
[281:22.54]And it was fucking disgusting that they didn't do that.
[281:26.10]And I will never go back to this place ever again.
[281:29.81]The tomato sauce was of high quality.
[281:32.15]The server didn't remember my name.
[281:36.13]So they obviously, I'm going to have to give Minus a full star for that one.
[281:50.34]Wait, that's wrong.
[281:53.78]This is dumb.
[282:05.79]Whoa, this wasn't mixed enough?
[282:11.97]Angry, grumpy, spoiled old man rants about food and dies of a heart attack in the middle of the podcast.
[282:18.99]That's like sad.
[282:19.97]I don't want to think about that.
[282:20.97]I don't want to have that thought in my head.
[282:32.74]And when I went there, you don't understand.
[282:35.71]I dropped my napkin on the ground and it wasn't replaced within one minute.
[282:47.32]I don't think I want to live that life, right?
[282:49.04]No, I don't know.
[282:56.82]This person's wanted this Calypso coconut thing.
[283:03.21]Should I go out there and just say, hey, listen, I'm sorry, I don't know how to make that.
[283:07.97]I know you saw some TikTok video of this secret menu, but I don't know what the fuck this is.
[283:19.24]Okay, I think I do know what it is.
[283:34.66]There we go.
[283:35.32]Okay.
[283:46.14]Remember, you use TikTok?
[283:47.86]No, I just pretend to to fit in.
[283:52.19]I have to be, like, aware of it.
[283:53.77]Come on.
[284:05.22]Anybody else in line?
[284:06.08]No.
[284:08.48]Alright, so it's blue, coconut, blue sprinkles.
[284:14.47]This thing does look really good, though.
[284:15.91]I would eat this one.
[284:35.64]You know, I've been really too timid with that.
[284:37.98]That was almost a perfect pour.
[284:45.32]There we go.
[284:46.27]This one looks really good.
[284:56.65]That's my best one yet, I think.
[285:09.62]What about deep dish pizza?
[285:12.58]I like a thinner crust.
[285:14.62]Deep dish pizza to me is a lasagna.
[285:19.92]Lasagna is delicious.
[285:21.71]Deep dish pizza is delicious.
[285:24.75]But I prefer a thinner crust.
[285:31.77]If you could preserve any existing food menu items so that it would be available forever, what would you pick?
[285:36.10]Cheese or gordita crunch from Taco Bell.
[285:38.25]The aliens would have to eat that at some point.
[286:00.58]know how a lot of times I'm a little bit older and maybe some of you are also in this you know after 30 or even if you're in your mid to late 20s you know there's that food item that you look back oh my god all the nostalgia videos of imagine if this was still a thing I am so glad that the cheesy gordita crunch from when I was like 13 to all the way to now it's been the exact same I'm so happy that I don't have to think about where that went
[286:29.28]That is one of those items that if it was gone 10 years ago, I would be desperately talking about how much I wish I could eat one.
[286:39.13]But I don't have to think like that because it's available and I'm going to fail this one.
[286:45.19]Good luck.
[286:47.20]Um, excuse me.
[286:48.64]What the hell?
[286:56.30]Uh...
[287:00.56]I almost have it.
[287:01.56]Come on, man.
[287:16.79]It's not enough fucking time to do this.
[287:17.85]I got it.
[287:23.49]Okay, good.
[287:28.80]Calm down with the come on, mans.
[287:31.74]Am I doing that a lot?
[287:36.56]Do I say come on man a lot?
[287:51.23]What?
[287:52.53]A and B button.
[287:53.37]Okay.
[287:57.21]Okay.
[288:03.64]Oh, this is all the customer is.
[288:04.99]Who have I served the most?
[288:07.23]I feel like I've served way more than this.
[288:19.47]Maybe not.
[288:36.16]I want to get this hat off.
[288:49.77]Willy Wonka?
[289:21.62]The Willy Wonka stream is something else I really wish I was able to do at some point.
[289:25.77]It would have been so much fun.
[289:44.56]There's still time.
[289:47.78]Yeah, but I really, you know... You're talking like you can't do it now.
[289:56.03]No, but... No... No...
[290:22.60]Did I do this one right?
[290:35.94]What a health and safety nightmare.
[290:39.77]Well, alright, let me... Okay, I'll be real... Let me be realistic.
[290:43.77]A lot of times I'll come up with something that I want to do.
[290:46.55]And then realize to do it right will be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[290:52.68]So I go, oh, okay, that sounds fun.
[290:55.54]How do I do that?
[290:57.34]How do I be able to, like, afford that and not lose everything?
[291:14.32]Oh.
[291:30.97]And also, stuff like that, I think the reason why a lot of you like the kind of show, in quote, streams or the event type streams, is because I'm doing those when I really want to.
[291:45.60]And it's like, I'm super excited, I'm super passionate about it, I want to go for it as hard as I can.
[291:50.84]I think that's probably why, because they don't have to happen all the time.
[291:53.88]It's not something, oh wow, I can't like, every 30 days there's going to be something fucking crazy.
[292:01.24]I want to steer away from that.
[292:02.46]Because I feel like over the last year, I've really tried to do that.
[292:17.83]And you're watching right now, I think part of the stream that I was maybe missing.
[292:28.66]For me, at least.
[292:52.22]Just make the smoothies, man.
[292:53.40]It's alright.
[292:57.06]You should do whatever makes you happy.
[292:59.00]This makes me happy right now.
[293:05.45]And who knows?
[293:05.79]I don't know.
[293:06.95]There are other things that are making me really happy.
[293:08.53]Obviously, the Grotto Beasts project is a lot of work and a lot of time went into that.
[293:14.01]There's a lot of things to still show.
[293:15.73]So that's really exciting.
[293:20.45]But I got to be all in.
[293:21.33]I have to be all in.
[293:27.12]And I definitely think it's best to pull back.
[293:34.06]This is correct, right?
[293:35.42]No, it's not.
[293:36.00]Throw it away.
[293:45.47]I didn't even start that other one.
[293:46.39]Wait, what is this one?
[293:47.47]Oh, shit.
[293:47.83]Hold on.
[293:48.10]This one's easy.
[293:55.25]Really like these no-cam chill streams.
[293:58.14]Yeah, so do I. So do I. We have elementary school dork taste in games.
[294:15.37]Isn't this like half of everybody in this chat's favorite Flash series?
[294:22.49]I thought I was being a pleaser today.
[294:28.58]Okay.
[294:30.31]This is this one.
[294:42.25]This is still Club Penguin.
[294:43.65]This is great.
[294:45.47]This is very inoffensive music.
[294:47.57]It just feels good to play it.
[294:52.89]Just hanging out in the background.
[294:59.09]Alright, I need two mediums.
[295:03.06]Strawberry and then strawberry lemonade.
[295:10.48]Is this Wii Sports music?
[295:11.72]It kind of is.
[295:12.18]Alright, it's cake.
[295:16.59]Cake and blue.
[295:24.27]You thought about doing some more small scale stuff?
[295:26.92]Yes.
[295:27.08]Yes.
[295:28.79]You'll see.
[295:31.53]The answer to that question is yes.
[295:32.57]I gotta be careful.
[295:58.43]I can get really, really into stuff and then be like, wow, I just only want to do that.
[296:04.61]And then I could get myself into a lot of trouble if I don't be careful with that.
[296:23.28]Well, when I say trouble, I mean,
[296:26.23]doing a bunch of streams that are big, big, big, bigger.
[296:28.91]It's got to be bigger.
[296:29.55]It's got to be crazier.
[296:30.43]It's got to be even more ridiculous.
[296:31.83]I mean, I'll just start blowing money left and right.
[296:37.22]And sponsors can help.
[296:40.96]But it's never... I obviously want to make sure that... Is this the... Did I do this wrong?
[296:48.78]No, this is correct.
[296:59.00]Have you lost passion over the years for streaming?
[297:01.30]No.
[297:02.56]I don't think that's true.
[297:07.31]I think because I've been doing it for long enough that I can kind of cyclically go through different phases and keep myself interested.
[297:18.27]So that, I mean, that's really important.
[297:20.57]What?
[297:20.87]Oh.
[297:33.15]Sprinkles, coconut, and then that.
[297:35.09]This dude can't remember a color for more than two seconds.
[297:38.87]No, I can't.
[297:39.77]It's true.
[298:12.97]Level 13.
[298:13.97]Yes!
[298:17.37]What about Toontown?
[298:18.15]I was going to play Toontown a while ago.
[298:22.28]Just never did.
[298:22.72]There was a reason why I didn't.
[298:29.01]I forget what it was.
[298:47.59]You would crash, too, in town so bad.
[298:55.26]Maybe that is what happened.
[299:02.79]Do you ever get burnt out?
[299:04.53]Um...
[299:07.45]Yeah.
[299:09.49]That's a hard one to answer because I... I know the joke here is that I don't stream that often.
[299:15.05]But that's very specifically to make sure that does not happen.
[299:27.48]What was that?
[299:31.84]Like I... Sometimes I might just disappear for like four or five straight days.
[299:35.08]That happens.
[299:36.49]Pretty frequently here.
[299:44.76]Get out of the way.
[299:45.96]How is this fair?
[299:46.52]There's been no coins on the bottom or top.
[299:48.86]And they've been hogging the middle.
[299:49.94]When are you going to finally retire?
[300:11.92]I will tell you
[300:13.84]Retirement on this channel is going to be soft.
[300:17.30]It'll be a soft retirement.
[300:29.76]And what does that mean by soft retirement?
[300:31.36]That means I'm not going to stop.
[300:35.70]I don't think I ever will be able to.
[300:42.89]Cryptic Andy?
[300:45.67]No, I'm just saying, like, it's not gonna be a case where it's like, oh, by the way, I am retired!
[300:50.95]Twitch is deleted, YouTube is deleted, and I'm gone, my Twitter's gone, and you never hear, I literally never, you don't hear from me ever again.
[300:57.08]No.
[301:10.24]You should transition to Battletoads.
[301:17.85]Battletoads is sick.
[301:18.75]That's not a bad idea.
[301:34.55]No, I'm such a fucking clown.
[301:38.01]It would be embarrassing because I would be like, oh, I'm retired.
[301:41.41]And then like a month later, Jirba is coming out of retirement to do this.
[301:46.41]No.
[301:47.09]We'll call it a soft retirement.
[301:49.55]Whenever that is.
[301:50.17]I gotta have my food podcast eventually.
[302:03.16]Come on.
[302:17.47]Did I do this one wrong?
[302:18.21]Is this the wrong size?
[302:20.25]No, it's good.
[302:27.49]Will we know when the soft retirement has started?
[302:30.61]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[302:33.25]I wouldn't keep you guys completely in the dark over that.
[302:35.09]That'd be weird.
[302:35.91]We got a new ingredient?
[302:44.90]Oh, Pog!
[302:45.84]Oh!
[302:49.58]It's crispy dots, whatever they are.
[302:57.75]Monthly retirement conversation?
[302:59.13]That's not true.
[302:59.67]That's not true.
[303:01.95]We have not talked about this in probably at least four to six months.
[303:05.24]That's not true.
[303:21.79]Dots on Dippin' Dots Ice Cream of the Future.
[303:24.01]S+.
[303:26.43]The first time I ate Dippin' Dots, I was a kid.
[303:29.28]And I think my eyes were going to bug out of my head.
[303:34.38]It was one of the greatest experiences of my entire life.
[303:40.91]If there was a video camera back then,
[303:45.46]And like my mother took, or like my parents took a video of me eating Dippin' Dots for the first time.
[303:50.66]It probably would be a meme right now.
[303:53.32]Like a decade, two decades, three decades later.
[303:57.87]It'd be one of those like, look at this little kid does something really funny.
[304:00.33]Okay, I need a large and a medium.
[304:18.33]Chocolate.
[304:21.03]You lied about watching Mob Psycho 100.
[304:22.61]Oh, shit.
[304:23.89]Somebody actually remembered that.
[304:24.82]When's your birthday?
[304:52.25]The Dippin Dots kid finally plays Papa's Freezeria.
[304:56.27]That's me.
[305:05.14]The Dippin Dots kid.
[305:12.14]All of my merchandise would have to be like that picture or that screenshot of my reaction to eating the Dippin Dots.
[305:24.33]At all the conventions, everyone would want me to do the face.
[305:28.46]Like, do the brain freeze face!
[305:40.82]Dippin' Dots tier list.
[305:43.44]Can you even buy Dippin' Dots?
[305:46.51]To me, Dippin' Dots are in a machine in a mall.
[305:49.61]Where do you get them?
[306:00.55]Alright, what do I gotta take?
[306:02.05]What's this?
[306:06.59]This one here.
[306:10.43]Get them online and deliver them.
[306:14.33]How do they?
[306:14.63]Is it packaged in a freezer?
[306:17.28]How do they make sure it gets there?
[306:18.30]It's still being perfect.
[306:23.86]But yeah, this is not just something you get on an amusement park.
[306:27.52]Or at a mall.
[306:35.88]They ship with dry ice.
[306:37.16]Are they really?
[306:47.34]They have a system.
[306:47.94]You think they're amateurs or something?
[306:49.02]I mean, you don't create ice cream like that and not know kind of what's going on.
[307:01.18]The Dippin' Dots CEO could run for president.
[307:03.48]And I'd be like, alright.
[307:04.96]Alright, I think he understands.
[307:05.82]I think he understands.
[307:07.42]This guy can lead us.
[307:18.73]Whoever they are.
[307:21.83]The Dippin' Dots CEO.
[307:23.63]Weekly Dippin' Dots brand?
[307:25.09]This is the first time I've ever spoke about this.
[307:43.77]You're delusional, dude.
[307:50.87]He... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[307:53.47]Will he tell me to use the gumball machine?
[307:57.04]Oh, fuck, I have to play.
[308:07.85]The best thing about Dippin' Dots was being at an amusement park.
[308:10.31]It was.
[308:12.73]And you could just see the air coming off of it.
[308:16.14]Whatever it was.
[308:16.96]CO2, nitrogen.
[308:17.76]I don't even know what it is.
[308:19.04]But when they take that shit out of the container, they do the big scoop, big scoop, and they hand it to you.
[308:24.40]And this thing is smoking.
[308:27.97]Ugh.
[308:28.87]You can't replace that.
[308:31.74]Join me for another amazing afternoon called Grandpa Jeremy's Sweets and Treats.
[308:40.91]This episode, we're going to be talking about ice cream and how delicious it is and when I was younger, different experiences I had.
[308:48.81]One time I wanted... Yeah, it's going to happen eventually.
[308:52.00]That's the plan.
[309:04.52]You got two orders.
[309:05.54]I know.
[309:05.90]I'm going.
[309:25.89]And make sure to get my cookbook.
[309:30.85]Eggs and such.
[309:33.43]It's four pages long.
[309:35.97]It's my secret recipe for... I don't fucking remember.
[309:42.89]And then there's a big forward by me telling you that they're really happy that you downloaded their book.
[309:49.98]And then my favorite songs are on the last one.
[309:56.06]There's only two recipes in the book.
[310:03.78]I'm gonna try egg-flavored Dippin' Dots today.
[310:06.96]And they are fucking disgusting.
[310:12.46]Oh no, I better be careful, then that channel turns into, like, like, cinnamon challenges and stuff.
[310:16.60]Uh-oh.
[310:19.34]Today on Food Sweet Treats with Grandpa, I'm gonna eat the one-chip hot fucking chip challenge today.
[310:27.16]Ow!
[310:30.21]Oh no!
[310:43.25]Somebody said, bro, why are people tipping you this much for ice cream?
[310:46.10]I don't know.
[310:46.76]They're being like generous.
[310:47.86]I don't know.
[310:52.52]How much are they tipping?
[310:53.22]It's not, it's like a few bucks, five bucks.
[311:02.66]You're doing body language with the camera off, aren't you?
[311:04.96]I mean, yeah, because I'm talking and people talk and they move their arms.
[311:19.26]$13 tip.
[311:19.48]That's a pretty good tip.
[311:20.24]$13?
[311:20.26]What are we selling these for?
[311:21.26]That guy loves ice cream.
[312:01.69]Nice.
[312:05.29]Have you played this for five hours?
[312:06.53]This game's a classic.
[312:09.47]And... I don't know, we've just been talking.
[312:12.31]Chilling out, talking.
[312:13.21]Well, I've been talking.
[312:14.41]You've been listening.
[312:17.06]Don't ever mistake that.
[312:19.66]Don't ever mistake that.
[312:27.04]Oh my god.
[312:29.28]Why did I do that?
[312:30.02]I was like aiming over there.
[312:39.65]oh cool there's way too much stuff in this restaurant
[313:09.08]Alright, let's do one more night.
[313:10.78]One more day.
[313:12.20]And then I'll probably call it there.
[313:13.22]I want to get some food.
[313:15.92]Ooh, new topping.
[313:29.00]I'll be back tomorrow, don't worry.
[313:30.22]We're starting earlier tomorrow anyways.
[313:45.47]Looks good.
[313:53.16]What are we doing tomorrow?
[313:53.94]We are watching old 90s commercials.
[313:57.92]That's the plan.
[314:00.70]And then on Sunday, we're going to play the House Flipper DLC.
[314:06.29]Farm DLC.
[314:25.87]Very interested.
[314:32.11]Yeah, we got some fun stuff to do.
[314:43.22]Chocolate chip.
[314:53.54]And a cherry.
[315:01.82]Can you see how tall the whipped cream can go?
[315:04.26]Yeah, before I... I'll go and mess around in the other boat.
[315:06.66]I have plenty more ingredients now.
[315:18.73]Is this ready?
[315:19.81]Oh, almost.
[315:29.28]What is this stuff here?
[315:31.83]Cherry sauce or something?
[315:48.34]Blood.
[315:50.82]There's a four.
[315:51.42]There's a five star customer now.
[315:54.94]I've got at least three or four five star customers.
[315:59.52]Can you do a doy doy doy?
[316:00.56]We've been good.
[316:01.02]Yep.
[316:05.86]I can't do it anymore.
[316:09.04]I can do it a little bit.
[316:26.09]I used to be disgusting at the doy doy doy.
[316:37.44]Other people have tried to match, you know, me doing it, but it's just... No one could even come close back in the day.
[317:02.23]That's probably what I'm most known for.
[317:09.63]Oh, no, I'm definitely most known for burp, puking, and swallowing it.
[317:13.97]That was, like, my claim to fame from, like, five years ago.
[317:19.49]Okay.
[317:32.94]Shit is not even right.
[317:34.48]Oh.
[317:44.95]I remember when I got called out so bad.
[317:47.47]There was a point a few years ago where somebody said, hey, dude, you know, you keep doing the like, I'm going to puke and then swallow it thing.
[317:56.82]And I was like, no way.
[317:58.76]I've done it once.
[318:00.16]And I think they came with receipts and they were like five different times that I did it over the course of like six months.
[318:07.39]It was a thing that I did all the time, apparently.
[318:17.12]Hey, I was pretty good at it.
[318:31.18]Coconut.
[318:42.57]Nice.
[318:44.17]Still another order.
[318:47.44]Uh, it was mixed for way too long.
[318:51.06]Okay.
[319:08.65]How often do you actually puke?
[319:11.09]I haven't... I mean, this is kind of a gross conversation.
[319:13.83]Throw that away.
[319:14.67]Uh-oh.
[319:17.34]It's been a pretty long time.
[319:18.60]I actually don't remember.
[319:30.59]Well, that's not true.
[319:31.89]I remember Holly and I went out one night.
[319:35.45]And we ate a bunch of pizza.
[319:38.27]This is recent.
[319:40.45]And we got an Uber home.
[319:45.85]It was like the... I feel like it was the way that the pizza was settled and the way the car was being driven.
[319:50.47]But I was like, I don't feel good.
[319:51.77]And I puked.
[319:53.63]Yeah.
[319:54.17]Now that happened.
[320:02.66]No, no, not in... No, no, no.
[320:04.14]This is like well after, like... This is well after being out of the car.
[320:09.63]Not in the car.
[320:10.31]No.
[320:10.39]No.
[320:12.57]Well after at least I'd say at least 15 to 20 minutes later.
[320:17.44]It was like the pizza just was sitting so strangely and I don't know something about being.
[320:32.57]Maybe I got like a little car sick or something.
[320:36.57]Is that that can happen to me sometimes?
[320:40.09]Depending on where I am in the car.
[320:50.68]No, I didn't puke in an Uber.
[320:52.78]Guys, what are you talking about?
[320:56.98]I puked like an hour later after being out of the car.
[321:08.65]Before that, it was probably like 10 to 15 years.
[321:18.99]I'm not gonna let you tell me Didn't you say 20 minutes?
[321:22.93]I don't know how fucking long it was It was at least 20 minutes Where are the customers?
[321:32.96]Hold on, whose order do I have?
[321:38.02]Whose order is this?
[321:41.96]There ain't nobody here
[321:47.30]Who am I making this for?
[321:48.36]Me?
[322:23.80]I gotta hurry this up.
[322:24.96]They've been gone.
[322:29.15]No one wants to eat your moldy ice cream?
[322:31.75]I don't know how many times I've puked, okay?
[322:35.33]Probably a few in the last ten years.
[322:38.13]Maybe like three?
[322:38.93]Hey, how about this?
[322:42.57]How many times have you puked?
[322:44.14]When was the last time you puked, huh?
[322:46.58]How many times have you puked in the last year?
[322:48.86]Two years?
[322:49.60]Five years?
[322:49.92]I'm gonna flip it on you now.
[322:56.44]Sometimes you just kind of feel like shit, and sometimes you puke.
[322:58.53]Whatever.
[322:58.83]Yeah, maybe every few years or something.
[323:10.20]I don't think that happens that often.
[323:30.17]A couple of months ago I did.
[323:31.93]I ate a full pizza.
[323:33.43]That's what I'm saying.
[323:34.65]I had like pizza and it was like settling wrong with me.
[323:37.37]Settled wrong.
[323:54.94]Oh shit.
[323:55.24]Well that's 75 points.
[324:02.78]I actually like this comment a lot.
[324:04.50]Imagine throwing up.
[324:07.08]Wait, I gotta read it.
[324:08.14]It was about being an adult or something.
[324:09.90]Hold on.
[324:10.22]It was funny.
[324:10.76]Where is it?
[324:15.89]Where is it?
[324:16.39]It was funny.
[324:19.43]Come on.
[324:25.75]I can't find it.
[324:30.04]I don't know what the message was.
[324:32.38]It was like, oh, imagine you throwing up, like be an adult.
[324:36.24]Yeah, imagine throwing up, you're an adult.
[324:42.19]Alright, if that's a true statement, this is coming from somebody that's probably never had one of those 24 hour bugs where you are puking and shitting every 15 minutes.
[324:51.37]And I'm sorry, but I actually feel, I'm actually really happy that you've never had to experience that before.
[324:57.60]I'm actually really glad that you never had to deal with that.
[325:00.42]That's actually great.
[325:01.90]I hope you never have to.
[325:04.58]I have had to deal with that before.
[325:06.24]And it is not fun.
[325:11.46]You're an adult.
[325:12.93]I love that.
[325:16.99]I don't eat poisonous food?
[325:23.17]You don't know what you... What?
[325:24.55]It's not...
[325:33.43]They're jealous, dude.
[325:35.53]I don't know if you'd be jealous of somebody throwing up and like shitting their pants.
[325:41.40]I didn't shit my pants.
[325:42.32]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[325:52.66]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[326:00.72]So you shit your pants in an Uber.
[326:02.80]You guys, I swear to God.
[326:11.37]Imagine walking into a restaurant and the cashier is just straight up rambling about all the times he puked.
[326:28.35]I'm gonna shit your pants.
[326:31.96]Alright, I feel like we should... Alright, I feel like you should time that person off for five minutes.
[326:37.74]Right?
[326:38.48]That's like five minutes, right?
[326:39.62]You should time it off for two minutes.
[326:48.89]I'm gonna puke in your Uber.
[326:52.25]Oh my god.
[327:00.32]Hey, don't be an asshole to Uber drivers.
[327:05.20]They gotta deal with enough bullshit as it is.
[327:06.74]Am I the asshole?
[327:20.57]Am I the asshole?
[327:27.72]Please don't shit in my pants.
[327:31.04]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[327:43.19]This is fun.
[327:43.73]I like this.
[327:44.09]This is a good time.
[327:44.99]I'm going to watch some ads tomorrow.
[327:50.84]That's the plan.
[327:52.82]Starting somewhere around 4pm Pacific.
[327:55.78]A couple hours earlier.
[328:02.81]Probably not going to be a long one tomorrow.
[328:05.07]Maybe a few hours.
[328:05.63]I feel like there's only a certain amount of those videos that we can handle.
[328:12.85]But Sunday we will do a big meaty one because of House Flipper.
[328:23.73]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[328:26.13]Take care of yourselves.
[328:30.34]Club Penguin sound effect has been going for two hours and I'm not even upset about it.
[328:35.70]Does this save?
[328:40.41]I think so, right?
[328:42.17]Yeah.
[328:46.11]Yep.
[328:48.65]Thanks for sticking around.
[328:49.31]See you tomorrow.
[328:52.61]If you're going to show up tomorrow.
[328:54.45]I would highly suggest you do if you have time.
[328:57.69]I feel like tomorrow will be a really fun stream.
[329:00.05]Those ad streams are really actually some of my favorites.

[329:36.54]Yes.
[329:51.43]Yeah.
[329:52.33]Take care.

[329:54.99]Have a great evening.

[329:57.73]But late night, Andy.
