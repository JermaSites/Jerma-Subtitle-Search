[00:24.81]Hello!
[00:26.67]Welcome to the Easy Bake Oven stream!
[00:28.73]Can you hear me?
[00:31.15]Can you guys hear me?
[00:33.35]We're just at the beach having a good time.
[00:34.69]Wait, hold on, I can't see anything.
[00:38.99]Alright, so, when I was setting this up, am I even fucking live?
[00:43.74]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:45.90]I've got this elaborate setup, hold on.
[00:53.58]Am I live?
[00:55.48]Am I even fucking live?
[00:58.38]I better be.
[01:01.34]I am!
[01:01.74]Alright, alright, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:03.74]How does it sound?
[01:04.48]Alright, I gotta do chat only.
[01:10.38]Oh fuck, I can't go that way.
[01:15.44]I can't get the chat to work.
[01:16.58]This is a fucking disaster.
[01:19.24]I got my tools ready.
[01:21.25]As you see in front of you, I can't fucking believe I'm doing this stream.
[01:26.07]Yeah.
[01:28.82]I paid for studio time to be in this spot right now to do this stream.
[01:34.82]We'll be here tomorrow to do... I still can't see what you guys are saying.
[01:41.70]Is it connected?
[01:43.66]What the fuck?
[01:45.92]Hold on, get... Give me a second.
[01:49.26]I swear to God we're gonna make cookies in a few minutes.
[01:52.26]Why is it... I can't see shit.
[02:00.15]Hold on.
[02:00.33]I'm supposed to be at the beach.
[02:10.32]Why can't I...
[02:16.10]Give me one second.
[02:31.93]There we go.
[02:32.85]Now I can see you.
[02:35.11]Now I can see you.
[02:40.56]All right, let's go.
[03:00.34]You're scary.
[03:02.42]Your mic sucks.
[03:04.54]Well, I lost the other mic.
[03:10.63]And this is the, if you want to know the truth, this is the microphone from, if you would believe it, the Lifeline stream.
[03:20.45]This is the Lifeline microphone.
[03:29.08]It's for the PlayStation 2.
[03:30.92]I had a panic moment here like two or three hours ago where I was like, what happened to the mic that I actually always use?
[03:36.35]Where is it?
[03:38.21]Do a sexy pose.
[03:43.41]All right.
[03:44.05]Listen to me.
[03:44.67]This is important.
[03:45.26]Is it crusty?
[03:46.50]Is it like really crusty?
[03:48.14]It doesn't matter.
[03:51.36]Hold on.
[03:51.60]What if I move it a little bit?
[03:54.40]How crusty is it?
[03:58.49]Move it away from my mouth.
[04:02.80]How's that?
[04:03.18]Is that better?
[04:06.40]Is it a little bit better?
[04:07.98]Now can you hear me?
[04:09.95]Do we sound better now?
[04:12.57]All right.
[04:13.25]Okay.
[04:15.27]Excellent.
[04:17.67]It is actually better.
[04:18.65]Yeah, it's because I'm speaking out directly out this way.
[04:21.97]And it looks like I'm on fucking QVC presenting the EZBake oven.
[04:25.57]Which I'm not, by the way.
[04:26.63]I've got to make this really, really clear.
[04:27.90]This is really important.
[04:30.30]They have nothing to do with this.
[04:32.00]I know it's presented in a way like they would.
[04:34.40]They have nothing to do with this.
[04:35.42]I know it looks like an ad stream, but I swear to God this is not.
[04:39.33]an ad stream.
[04:41.73]This is just something that we came up with.
[04:43.58]Is this thing hot?
[04:44.64]Okay, it is.
[04:45.58]I'm, like, afraid of this.
[04:46.98]Have we talked about that yet?
[04:47.94]How, like, I'm actually kind of terrified of this fucking thing?
[04:51.30]Because the old EasyBake oven had a window here where you could see what the fuck was going on.
[04:56.71]Now, this new one, this is like the new age one, they've just, wait, did I peel the plastic off this?
[05:01.31]Uh-oh.
[05:05.92]No, that's supposed to stay on there.
[05:07.02]Okay.
[05:07.93]The old one had a window that you could look through.
[05:10.67]But this one just fucking... How are you supposed to know when the food is done?
[05:15.56]You just stuff it in here and wait like five minutes and then pull it out?
[05:20.64]How are you supposed to know?
[05:22.50]Because those of you guys that are like me, whenever I use a real oven, I have to go up to the oven, turn the oven light on, and just sit there and watch because I don't trust anything.
[05:32.17]I don't trust myself.
[05:32.99]I don't trust the oven.
[05:34.27]If it's like 400 degrees and you have to do a pizza for like 20 minutes, that oven light has to be on at all times and I have to fucking, is it burnt?
[05:40.21]Is it burnt?
[05:40.57]Is it, no, no, is it burnt?
[05:41.43]Is it burnt?
[05:42.25]So I can't really do that with this.
[05:45.61]What a loser.
[05:46.55]I mean, that's what I do.
[05:47.41]I don't cook, okay?
[05:48.95]This is the first cooking stream I've ever done.
[05:51.39]So which one of these do you want to start with?
[05:53.57]We have... What do we even have?
[05:57.24]I'll show them into the camera so you can see how delicious they are.
[05:59.80]You want to do pretzel?
[06:02.52]Hold on.
[06:02.88]We're going to do them all.
[06:04.92]Here's the pizza.
[06:08.83]That's pizza.
[06:09.93]This has egg wash?
[06:14.30]Adult supervision required.
[06:18.19]How do... I don't see how an eight-year-old can do this.
[06:23.35]Eight plus.
[06:26.85]I don't think I... I don't think I was able to even leave the house before I was eight, let alone use an oven.
[06:35.23]Eight plus?
[06:36.59]All right, so you... Should I start... Might as well start with the pizza.
[06:38.85]I got my shit ready.
[06:40.61]This... I got my water bowl just in case I get thirsty.
[06:43.83]I was thinking about doing a joke when this first started where I was gonna, like, oh, I'm thirsty, and do a dog lapping up out of the bowl joke.
[06:50.47]But then I was like, no, that's fucked up.
[06:51.85]I don't think I want to do that.
[06:53.79]I was gonna be like, oh, nice water!
[06:57.70]But then I would fucking ruin the day.
[06:59.24]It's too early for that.
[07:00.72]It's only been, like, ten minutes.
[07:03.58]That's why... Wait, this is an adults-only stream.
[07:10.59]Oh, shit!
[07:11.89]That's right!
[07:12.73]The mature audience thing is on!
[07:15.25]Why would there... Mature Easy Bake Oven Stream?
[07:19.31]That doesn't make any sense.
[07:20.80]I... Well, it's staying.
[07:22.04]I mean, I'm gonna say the f-word a few times.
[07:24.26]Alright, let's get this open.
[07:25.02]I'm gonna do the pizza first.
[07:27.46]Is this ready?
[07:29.32]So it goes in and then out?
[07:30.92]Alright, so let me... What the... Do I need to have, like, an egg?
[07:35.18]I didn't bring anything else.
[07:39.04]Nice unboxing video for all of you that don't care about it.
[07:45.30]Porn stream.
[07:48.99]Oh, I need an egg.
[07:49.85]Do I need an egg?
[07:50.59]I don't think I do.
[07:51.25]Do I actually need a fucking egg?
[07:56.09]By the way, I'm not going to eat any of this.
[07:57.31]I just wanted to make that really clear with you guys.
[07:58.77]I'm not eating any of this.
[08:01.69]Easy Bake Garlic... Garlic Herb Cheese Mix.
[08:11.61]Oh my god, it's in like a bag.
[08:15.43]By the way, they have nothing to do with this stream.
[08:17.19]Like, if I talk about how gross this is, I just, just my, my opinions on the product.
[08:22.16]Okay, this is my opinions on their product.
[08:24.42]That's it.
[08:25.08]This is my opinions on the product.
[08:26.68]Nobody had any of the fucking, no, the Hasbro had nothing to do with this.
[08:30.12]Can you see me?
[08:33.02]This is my opinions on the product.
[08:34.24]That's it.
[08:34.64]Okay, here we go.
[08:35.86]Easy Bake Marinara Mix.
[08:39.18]Egg Wash.
[08:42.35]Pizza dough?
[08:43.19]Would pizza dough mix?
[08:44.59]Okay, I'm gonna... I don't think I'm capable of doing this.
[08:47.26]Where's the instructions?
[08:49.32]I got my bowls.
[08:50.02]Hold on.
[08:52.06]This is all powdered.
[08:54.82]And this is gonna turn into a pizza.
[08:56.60]That's what I'm understanding.
[08:59.52]I feel like I'm doing a presentation at a county fair.
[09:02.78]with the microphone, and there's the Easy Bake Oven.
[09:05.24]As you can see, it's all powdered, so your children are gonna love it.
[09:08.02]And there's like one person in the audience.
[09:10.38]There's like 200 empty seats.
[09:15.33]I'm telling you, your kids are gonna love this.
[09:17.11]And then that one guy comes up and buys it.
[09:21.23]And the guy walks back to his car looking fucking sad, because he's got like 60 of these in his trunk, and he only got rid of one.
[09:28.80]Poor guy.
[09:30.14]Okay, cheese pizza.
[09:34.57]Preheat the EasyBake oven for 20 minutes, which I've done before the stream turned on.
[09:41.04]Spray baking pan with cooking spray.
[09:48.24]I don't have any cooking spray.
[09:54.05]Can I just like lick it?
[09:55.55]Can I just like drag my tongue up and down this?
[09:58.47]Oh no, I don't have any oil.
[10:03.61]Can I just, like, use my, like, forehead?
[10:06.81]Oh, fuck.
[10:07.53]I didn't know I was going to need oil.
[10:10.48]It said everything's in the package!
[10:11.78]It didn't say... It's all right.
[10:14.14]We're going to... Oh, this might be a disaster.
[10:16.00]I'm going to lick it.
[10:16.62]No, I'm not.
[10:16.96]That's disgusting.
[10:17.56]All right, here we go.
[10:19.66]It'll just be a little crusty.
[10:20.66]I'll just have to, like... I'll just have to, like, fucking get up there and, like... It'll be fine.
[10:28.06]This thing just started ticking.
[10:29.40]It was like...
[10:32.41]I was like, a bomb?
[10:33.83]No?
[10:34.35]What the fuck is that?
[10:37.53]It was ticking.
[10:39.63]I don't have any butter.
[10:40.63]I'm in a studio right now.
[10:43.23]I didn't bring any butter.
[10:49.39]All right, let's start.
[10:49.93]Let's make the sauce.
[10:50.79]Pour one marinara sauce mix and one and a half teaspoons.
[10:55.59]Is this a teaspoon?
[10:58.24]What is this?
[11:00.48]What is this?
[11:01.22]Is this a teaspoon?
[11:04.69]Or is this a tablespoon?
[11:07.43]By the way, why can't they just be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?
[11:11.40]Why does that... Tablespoon.
[11:12.40]Teaspoon.
[11:13.34]A pinch.
[11:13.72]A dash.
[11:14.60]A tap.
[11:16.36]No, no.
[11:17.14]Just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[11:18.62]Why does it have to be like that?
[11:19.87]I don't understand.
[11:20.57]Why teaspoon and tablespoon?
[11:22.61]Tablespoon should be 2.
[11:23.51]Teaspoon should be 1.
[11:24.07]Or 0.
[11:26.93]Alright.
[11:27.17]Marinara saw.
[11:27.81]Where is that?
[11:30.35]Mariners mix artificially flavored.
[11:32.63]Oh, you really?
[11:34.13]Grandma didn't make this, are you sure?
[11:37.61]Maybe she did.
[11:42.20]Okay.
[11:43.06]Pour the mariners sauce mix into a... Okay, I'm going to put it in here.
[11:47.06]Can you see what I'm doing here?
[11:50.55]Alright, let's take a look.
[11:59.18]Okay, in there it looks like Fun Dip.
[12:05.02]Don't knock that over.
[12:10.10]Alright, Strawberry Mint Fun Dip.
[12:12.16]Alright, there it is.
[12:12.88]Ooh.
[12:18.80]That's a smell that I've not smelled in my life.
[12:21.90]Okay.
[12:23.08]So then, pour one and a half teaspoons of water into bowl, stir the mixture with a spoon, and set it aside for later.
[12:30.51]Okay, so, here's one.
[12:38.33]Why does it have to be this hard?
[12:41.03]What kind of fuck is this?
[12:41.87]The spoon is flat!
[12:43.57]Alright, don't freak out.
[12:48.72]What the f- is this a magic trick?
[12:50.91]This is a magic trick!
[12:59.89]Whatever, I don't care.
[13:02.09]One?
[13:05.17]Okay, that's one and a half, I think.
[13:06.55]Okay, let's stir it up.
[13:07.33]You ready?
[13:08.37]Are you guys doing it at home?
[13:10.29]I feel like it needs to be more than that.
[13:20.21]I need more water than this.
[13:24.81]Can you guys, like, hear the sounds?
[13:26.31]Actually, it doesn't even look that bad.
[13:28.31]I need more water, but not that much, because I don't want to be too runny.
[13:34.76]Alright, like that.
[13:35.50]A little bit more.
[13:39.82]Just one more, there we go.
[13:41.20]Okay, good.
[13:43.49]Stop, stop, stop.
[13:44.51]I'm not going to fucking spill it.
[13:51.45]Alright, that's a good consistency.
[13:54.05]How is this going to make a pizza?
[13:56.63]This is one spoonful of baby food.
[14:00.63]This is not a... Where's the pizza?
[14:02.92]Is it going to go on a pizza?
[14:06.14]How big is this pizza?
[14:13.37]Okay, well...
[14:16.28]This seems to be... That's mixed up pretty well.
[14:19.76]No, no, no, no, no.
[14:20.94]Do not drop that in here.
[14:22.80]I can't do that.
[14:25.79]That looks pretty good, right?
[14:27.23]Would you say?
[14:30.55]Powdered pizza.
[14:31.77]Yeah, I know.
[14:33.07]Guys, have you ever had... How's my hair?
[14:35.76]I had a quarantine haircut.
[14:37.46]Kim gave one to me.
[14:39.30]Have you guys ever had Lunchables pizza?
[14:42.92]It's disgusting, I know.
[14:43.82]Remember, Lunch Balls has nothing to do with this stream.
[14:46.42]I just give my opinions on some products.
[14:48.38]These are my personal opinions.
[14:49.82]They have nothing to do with this stream.
[14:51.78]I think they're gross.
[14:53.06]And this is kind of what it is.
[14:54.86]It just looks like this.
[14:56.30]Alright, this is going to start to solidify.
[14:57.40]I've got to hurry up.
[14:58.72]Okay.
[15:00.48]Okay, now make the cheese.
[15:01.64]Pour one garlic herb cheese mix and water into a bowl and stir the mix with a spoon and set it aside for later.
[15:08.81]Oh, shit.
[15:09.45]I gotta get some more bowls.
[15:10.61]I have, like, five bowls.
[15:12.39]Alright, set that aside.
[15:13.13]We don't need that right now.
[15:16.47]Okay, make the cheese.
[15:17.57]One garlic herb.
[15:20.07]I can't even read.
[15:21.59]Garlic herb cheese.
[15:23.09]No, don't pour it into here!
[15:25.82]Oh, this is gonna be so bad.
[15:27.72]You guys don't understand.
[15:28.56]The bowls just keep increasing in size.
[15:32.51]This is the smallest bowl I have.
[15:34.57]The next one up is like this big.
[15:36.51]It's gonna be just like spread like a thin layer on the edges of it.
[15:40.49]It's gonna be bad.
[15:42.41]Use a sink?
[15:48.08]I'm not gonna make this in the sink.
[15:51.10]No, this is like clean water and I'm not gonna make this in the sink.
[15:56.28]How am I supposed to get all this equipment into the sink?
[15:58.50]How am I supposed to do that?
[16:00.71]Use the bathtub.
[16:02.11]No, here we go.
[16:04.11]Garlic herb cheese mix.
[16:08.43]And then just a little bit of water, right?
[16:09.75]Okay, I gotta wipe that off.
[16:11.78]Wait, wait!
[16:14.48]Did you just hit my jaw?
[16:16.98]My jaw just, like, snapped!
[16:18.74]I pogged so hard, I just, like, broke my jaw.
[16:24.89]What the fuck?
[16:25.85]Okay.
[16:25.99]Okay.
[16:27.93]This is what you're supposed to use.
[16:28.95]Alright, alright.
[16:30.27]Garlic herb cheese mix.
[16:33.56]Or, like, cocaine.
[16:39.64]You know what?
[16:40.28]I'll be honest with you.
[16:41.30]I gotta be completely real with you here.
[16:44.22]This smells like the shit that they sprinkle on the Pizza Hut pizza.
[16:47.42]And I kinda like it.
[16:48.94]I actually don't even think I wanna... I don't think I wanna add water to this.
[16:54.34]I kind of think I want to keep it like this, right?
[16:56.68]Why would I want to add water to this?
[16:58.02]Is it going to turn... Okay, hold on.
[17:00.28]Is it going to turn orange?
[17:01.16]Because that'll turn me off forever if it turns orange.
[17:05.66]How much water do I need?
[17:09.20]Half?
[17:09.70]One and a half teaspoons of water.
[17:12.43]Fuck.
[17:13.19]Okay, I'm just going to... Look, this is...
[17:24.34]I this there's only so much sauce there's such a little amount of sauce that I don't want to waste it all and I don't want to eat it I don't want I don't want to go like this mmm because I don't I'll probably throw up by the way and just in case I throw up I just want everyone to know I've got a fucking trash bag over here so I can say put my head in the trash bag puke in here that's the goal and it'll work I'm just gonna like wrap it up and puke it off camera and like turn mute the microphone
[17:53.43]Oh my god, don't say puke.
[17:55.07]Okay.
[17:56.59]One and a half teaspoons?
[17:57.45]We're gonna do it slowly.
[18:11.52]Okay.
[18:15.95]This is... Not enough water?
[18:24.07]Oh, wait a minute.
[18:24.75]This is like turning into like blue cheese.
[18:33.86]Oh, that's... Cottage cheese.
[18:37.52]Don't say cottage cheese.
[18:42.66]Don't say cottage cheese.
[18:49.39]I think it's supposed to look like this.
[18:50.55]It's supposed to be like pretend to be cheese, right?
[18:53.95]This is going to be sprinkled on top.
[18:55.41]This thing's going to burn, I think.
[18:56.89]Is this going to be light on fire?
[18:58.64]No.
[18:59.78]This thing's made for eight-year-olds.
[19:01.08]Why would it be like that?
[19:02.14]Okay, this is good.
[19:03.70]That looks pretty good, right?
[19:05.12]What do you guys think?
[19:08.50]Scrambled eggs.
[19:09.24]Okay, scrambled eggs, but the very end of the scrambled eggs, after you scramble the fuck out of them and you're done, the shit that's left in the pan that's all around the sides and shit, why am I saying this?
[19:21.58]Okay, now what?
[19:26.78]Make the cheese.
[19:27.42]Make the glaze.
[19:30.68]Pour one egg wash mix and two tablespoons of water into a bowl.
[19:33.80]Stir the mixture with a spoon and set it aside.
[19:36.02]How much bullshit am I going to have to fucking use?
[19:39.58]All this just for this tiny little iPhone case?
[19:46.50]Alright, hold on.
[19:47.18]Get that out of the way.
[19:48.16]I'm going to have to fucking wipe that down.
[19:50.02]Alright, next is the glaze.
[19:52.06]Egg wash.
[19:54.79]I gotta get, the balls just are gonna keep getting more and more comically oversized.
[19:58.80]Hold on a second.
[20:00.44]Where are my old balls?
[20:17.29]Where's this ball at?
[20:24.26]Wait a minute.
[20:25.48]Hold on a second.
[20:26.59]Hold on.
[20:27.37]The other balls are in the car.
[20:29.03]Hold on.
[20:29.31]I'll be right back.
[21:29.69]I swear to God, I'm the only, I'm the, hold on, can you hear me?
[21:33.27]I'm the only fucking idiot on Earth.
[21:34.85]I'm the only fucking idiot on Earth that gets a children's toy and gets bowls designed to make food for like ten people.
[21:53.22]They just keep getting bigger.
[21:58.30]All right, I don't need the lids.
[22:00.90]Are these gonna go rotten or what?
[22:06.63]All right, what the fuck am I doing, egg wash?
[22:11.53]Hold on, I gotta make sure these eggs stay fresh.
[22:19.06]I gotta, all right, clean as you, clean as you go, right?
[22:25.01]Clean as you go.
[22:25.73]I'm not gonna make a fucking mess, you know what I mean?
[22:28.33]Clean as you go.
[22:30.55]Get my puke bag.
[22:32.39]Alright.
[22:36.08]And the best thing about this is, like, if I want to spit something up, if I want to, like, spit out what I have, like I said, I just wrap my head around this, you don't even know what happened.
[22:43.94]And I'll just, like, let it just swarm out of my mouth.
[22:47.10]You won't even know what happened.
[22:50.44]Like, I can literally just go like that, and just go and you won't even know.
[22:55.46]Okay, what's next?
[22:56.72]Egg wash?
[23:02.21]Egg wash and two tablespoons of water.
[23:04.05]This is egg wash, right?
[23:07.53]This is yellow.
[23:09.85]I hate the smell of eggs.
[23:13.34]Like a raw egg is enough to drive me crazy.
[23:19.38]Do you guys hate that too?
[23:21.75]A raw egg has a very distinct, gross smell, and I don't like it.
[23:38.42]So what I was saying before, you know when, like, when I was setting this all up, and I was, like, getting the cameras ready and getting, like, getting, you know, going to the beach and getting to the fucking beach...
[23:49.05]I was just like looking at the table and all the setup and everything.
[23:52.77]I just said kind of under my breath.
[23:56.07]Why the fuck am I doing this?
[23:59.77]Eating sand.
[24:01.81]It does kind of look like sand.
[24:03.13]Alright, I gotta... This is just broke.
[24:12.99]It's just fucking broke.
[24:14.33]It just broke.
[24:16.57]How am I supposed to...
[24:21.75]I'm just gonna have to use my hands.
[24:24.23]It actually just broke.
[24:25.57]It actually did.
[24:26.15]Look at this.
[24:26.87]That's like a clean, weird break.
[24:32.58]Can I just push it back together?
[24:34.22]Okay, no, that's alright.
[24:37.76]I gotta get this.
[24:42.20]Okay.
[24:43.02]We're almost at the part where I make the dough.
[24:44.38]Get this out of my way.
[24:45.12]I need to like... Where are my towels?
[24:50.60]Thank you.
[25:05.45]You know what, I gotta fill another one of these with water and just, because this is not gonna work.
[25:13.13]Actually, it kind of is.
[25:13.89]Yeah, it's good.
[25:16.94]Does it really fucking matter?
[25:22.22]I should've got like 10 to these tools.
[25:27.90]Okay.
[25:29.90]This is, fucking goddammit.
[25:32.80]Somebody said this is cursed?
[25:34.42]Why?
[25:36.23]It's an easy-bake oven.
[25:37.88]What's wrong with this?
[25:39.06]Is there something wrong?
[25:42.54]It's contaminated.
[25:44.12]It's not contaminated.
[25:46.77]Guys, all this came from the same fucking factory.
[25:51.87]What do you mean contaminated?
[25:52.93]This all came from the same conveyor belt.
[25:57.36]In between!
[25:58.40]In between, like, pushing out glue!
[26:01.02]It's the same factory!
[26:02.64]This is my opinion.
[26:03.22]This is a joke.
[26:03.68]I just want to make sure that you know that Hasbro had nothing to do with this, and this is me making a satire on what could possibly be going on in a weird factory.
[26:10.06]It has nothing to do with... They'd have nothing to do with this, and I have nothing to do with them.
[26:18.82]These are just my comedic opinions on things that aren't even real.
[26:21.02]It's a joke, and it's a satire.
[26:22.24]It's a parody moment.
[26:25.49]Okay, what do I do?
[26:26.05]Water?
[26:27.96]How much water?
[26:29.76]Two tablespoons of water.
[26:30.94]This is actually fun, though.
[26:32.50]Can I be honest?
[26:34.94]Is that too much water?
[26:46.71]What is this supposed to be?
[26:47.83]What do you do with pizza?
[26:48.71]How is this a pizza?
[26:49.61]This is like dog puke.
[27:00.60]I have to use the spoon.
[27:02.52]No, just get rid of the handle.
[27:05.18]Just get rid of the handle.
[27:09.80]Whatever.
[27:11.36]This still works.
[27:12.40]It's just annoying.
[27:16.89]Okay.
[27:20.23]What does the FDA or what does FTC say about food being out for how long?
[27:26.32]There's 20 minutes, right, that you, like, food can be sitting out before it starts to be, like, poison?
[27:30.21]What is it?
[27:30.87]Somebody knows it.
[27:38.29]Okay.
[27:43.08]That's... This is... This is not... I don't like that.
[27:45.80]This is just to, like, make the dough look like it's cooked.
[27:50.74]Two minutes?
[27:53.80]I can't believe that thing just broke in my hand.
[27:55.34]That's unbelievable.
[27:58.43]Best part about this is because there's so little stuff, I realistically just have to like wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, and then just like be ready for the next one, because this is barely anything.
[28:09.72]All right, now it's time to make the pizza.
[28:14.31]We need one pizza dough and one,
[28:24.68]like in there right okay we need one pizza dough mix and one tablespoon of water there are two pizza dough mixes why spit spit you want me to spit in this no I'm not spitting in this are you guys fucking crazy why are there two why are there two of these
[28:58.45]Okay.
[28:59.99]Whatever.
[29:00.37]I don't know why there's two.
[29:02.51]You can make two pizzas.
[29:03.65]Spit in it.
[29:04.87]I'm not going to spit in this bowl.
[29:06.35]I think that's not even allowed on Twitch.
[29:08.76]Can you spit on Twitch?
[29:10.46]Is spitting allowed on Twitch?
[29:13.48]Can I spit?
[29:14.46]Is that allowed?
[29:17.42]Spit on Twitch.
[29:19.64]Am I going to get banned for spitting in this bowl?
[29:23.63]Oh, water!
[29:24.95]No, that's not a good transition there.
[29:27.35]Okay.
[29:27.45]Okay.
[29:36.86]Okay, I'm almost ready.
[29:39.69]How long does it take to cook?
[29:43.07]Six pizzas!
[29:49.65]Six?
[29:52.07]Split the dough into six pieces in what, small balls?
[29:57.88]How am I supposed to, how do you, what do you mean?
[30:00.90]Are they supposed to be like bagel bites?
[30:02.42]What is the, oh shit, they're supposed to be little bagel bites.
[30:10.48]I thought it was going to be like a, I don't know, like a Sicilian style, like a square or something, I don't know.
[30:17.60]Okay, let's go.
[30:21.54]I have to start using my hands?
[30:22.96]Oh boy.
[30:24.06]How much, uh... One tablespoon of water?
[30:31.93]That's way more than a tablespoon.
[30:34.57]Shit, it's okay.
[30:36.70]Okay, use your hands, stir and press the mixture together until you get dough.
[30:42.81]With my hands?
[30:44.20]What is that shitty little thing?
[31:08.50]This is not pizza dough.
[31:10.62]How is this pizza dough?
[31:15.30]It's ruined.
[31:15.96]I need more water.
[31:16.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:20.62]There's a hair in this.
[31:21.92]I can't use this anymore.
[31:22.91]I have to get a new one.
[31:23.75]There's hair in here.
[31:25.09]Look, there's like a speck of something in there.
[31:27.51]Can you guys see in there?
[31:28.97]Do you see the one speck of some kind of foreign debris?
[31:35.61]I can't even use this now.
[31:37.50]I hate that shit.
[31:38.34]I hate it.
[31:40.52]Okay, that's enough water.
[31:41.48]Put this back down.
[31:44.24]Why did I have to do the complicated one first?
[31:45.92]This is definitely the most complicated one.
[31:48.00]Why couldn't I just dump the brownie packet into the fucking ground and then just stir it up with my finger and put it in there?
[31:52.66]That's what the next one's gonna be.
[32:01.95]This is not pizza dough.
[32:07.41]This is gonna be like crackers.
[32:10.47]This is the bottom of the Lay's potato chip bag.
[32:14.37]This is not, this is the shit that you like dump out because it's not even edible.
[32:25.10]Yeah, and you think you get all cute, you dump the fucking bag up and it goes half in here and like 75% go around and then you crunch it, it hits the floor and you like cut all around your teeth.
[32:41.18]I need more... Do I need more water?
[32:44.32]Somebody help him.
[32:45.56]What?
[32:48.79]Use my hands.
[32:49.71]I'm not putting my fucking hands in this.
[32:51.39]Disgusting.
[32:59.48]I have to... Do I have to use my hands?
[33:00.98]I have to knead the dough.
[33:07.14]Fuck.
[33:07.54]Okay, hold on.
[33:09.18]I...
[33:12.45]Okay, that thing started making weird noise.
[33:14.81]Where do I put this?
[33:16.94]This is just dough.
[33:18.26]Hold on.
[33:18.68]I need a... Like this, right?
[33:25.38]You go like... I have to like stand up for this.
[33:38.39]Why don't I just make one big pizza?
[33:41.05]Why do I have to make six pizzas?
[33:49.73]More, I need to, you didn't have to?
[33:51.91]Do it.
[33:52.55]Just do it.
[33:53.15]Somebody, somebody call Osha.
[33:56.05]He didn't wash his hands.
[34:00.37]Okay, this is as good as it's gonna get.
[34:05.11]Like that.
[34:09.11]Okay, how are you supposed to make six?
[34:12.27]This, you don't make six out of this.
[34:17.57]This is one.
[34:19.76]This is smaller?
[34:20.98]I don't... How do I have to make a pizza?
[34:30.56]What does it say?
[34:32.07]Flatten each ball of dough like a pancake and shape it into a circle.
[34:45.08]Okay, here we go.
[34:57.63]Like that?
[34:58.05]Is this too big?
[35:02.41]Holy fucking shit.
[35:09.37]Okay, but I gotta make it nice.
[35:11.25]Alright, I'm doing like three.
[35:14.33]I feel like this is gonna bake into the pan and never come up.
[35:20.72]Like this is just gonna be part of the pan.
[35:23.60]Okay.
[35:24.76]Let's do another one.
[35:26.95]You don't have any oil.
[35:28.24]The fucking thing didn't say you needed oil.
[35:31.76]I don't need oil.
[35:32.64]Do I?
[35:35.30]Use CBD oil.
[35:39.36]I don't have CBD oil.
[35:42.30]Just spit on it.
[35:42.96]There's got to be something I can... I don't have butter.
[35:51.33]I thought it was all going to be inside of the packages.
[35:54.15]I think it'll be all right.
[35:56.60]I think it's gonna be alright.
[35:57.42]Okay, here we go.
[35:59.76]Look, I'll just... I won't put it in there for that long.
[36:02.14]Go to the store?
[36:03.36]I... What do you want me to just leave the stream on while I go to, like, a grocery store?
[36:09.16]Alright, how about this?
[36:13.63]If this is a fucking disaster, I'm going to, like, just go to a store.
[36:18.71]And I'll put on, like, the fucking... I don't know.
[36:20.69]We'll put on, like, Spongebob Squarepants OST.
[36:23.45]I'll be back.
[36:25.68]unironically, yes.
[36:28.47]Okay, here we go.
[36:30.31]Okay, I'm gonna do, like, two.
[36:31.99]Because this is just, this is ridiculous.
[36:43.90]Take us with you.
[36:44.56]No.
[36:44.78]I'm not taking you with me.
[36:50.42]How many fucking people are here?
[36:53.27]I didn't even, there are like 11 fucking thousand people here.
[36:56.22]What are you doing here?
[36:58.46]What the hell are you doing here?
[36:59.88]Why are you here right now?
[37:02.52]Oh my God.
[37:05.08]Shit, I gotta make the, I gotta do this good then.
[37:07.08]I can't just, I can't believe I don't have any fucking cooking spray.
[37:09.38]All right, I'm doing four.
[37:12.95]The one thing that I fucking could have needed, I didn't bring any of it.
[37:21.54]There's two packets.
[37:23.11]There's no way you make six out of this.
[37:25.89]No fucking way.
[37:27.39]In fact, how am I going to even put the sauce on here?
[37:29.73]This doesn't make any sense.
[37:33.93]It doesn't make any sense.
[37:36.46]I can't even fit this one on there.
[37:39.12]How small did they want you to make these?
[37:43.26]All right.
[37:43.68]There we go.
[37:45.26]I'm ready.
[37:47.32]On to the next part.
[37:51.83]Oh, I ripped it in half, right.
[37:56.37]Use a pastry brush to spread some glaze on top of the dough.
[38:08.65]What eight-year-old has a pastry brush?
[38:12.09]It says you can use your finger, OK.
[38:15.76]The glaze.
[38:24.25]Wait, this is like oil, right?
[38:25.51]Hold on.
[38:29.67]Wait, can I?
[38:30.11]I should put this on the bottom, too.
[38:31.19]This is like oil, isn't it?
[38:36.43]It's like a glaze.
[38:38.07]No, don't.
[38:38.71]Don't?
[38:39.03]What do you mean no?
[38:42.42]Why?
[38:43.22]It's like a glaze.
[38:50.84]You're gonna burn it.
[38:52.98]No, am I?
[38:54.28]It doesn't say that.
[38:54.94]It doesn't say could burn.
[38:56.18]Careful.
[39:09.77]I think that looks alright.
[39:12.25]Why do we have this much glaze?
[39:13.51]That's what I don't understand.
[39:19.25]It smells... Okay, if I could bring you here with me right now.
[39:24.81]This smells like... It's like it's implanting me somewhere.
[39:31.73]Like I'm going somewhere right now.
[39:32.79]I'm like on a journey.
[39:33.94]I'm going somewhere.
[39:34.62]Where am I going?
[39:36.36]It's summertime.
[39:39.74]It's summertime.
[39:41.64]There's a hot dog vendor.
[39:43.80]Sausage vendor, not hot dog.
[39:47.58]Toxic fumes, what?
[39:49.98]All right, fuck, nevermind.
[39:52.00]Hot dog vendor.
[39:53.40]Sausage vendor.
[39:54.95]It's like the air... The air that's coming off of the guy that makes the sausages at the kiosk.
[40:04.50]Okay, that's good enough.
[40:06.86]I need to... This is... Fucking eight-year-olds.
[40:15.57]Yeah, right.
[40:18.91]More like...
[40:24.99]I'm just going to wash my hands in here.
[40:27.49]I'm not going to need the water anymore.
[40:30.53]Yeah, that makes sense.
[40:32.92]That's alright.
[40:37.76]Sausage sweat.
[40:40.98]Okay, now spread the marinara sauce on top of the pizza.
[40:43.86]Be sure to save half the sauce for your second batch of pizzas.
[40:47.78]No thanks.
[40:49.28]I think it's going in the trash.
[40:55.92]This trash is going to smell so bad.
[40:58.06]Thank God it's one of those double ultra ones.
[41:01.22]Alright, let's put the sauce on here.
[41:03.47]This is good for now.
[41:05.69]Okay, so sauce goes on top.
[41:11.82]And can you see?
[41:38.83]I did it right.
[41:39.37]That's what you do.
[41:40.23]You go middle out.
[41:56.40]What are those pastries that have like the raspberry filling in the middle?
[42:03.03]What are those things called?
[42:03.93]You know what I'm talking about?
[42:04.97]The little cookies with the raspberry jam in the middle?
[42:08.44]That makes me want to eat those.
[42:12.60]I think this is too thick.
[42:14.54]I think that's the problem.
[42:21.84]How hot is it going to get in there?
[42:23.59]It's like freaking me out.
[42:27.09]I don't know why I feel like I'm going to push that in there and, like, the Burger King commercial is going to, like, be up the top here.
[42:33.34]I'm afraid of this.
[42:45.26]All right.
[42:45.56]That's enough sauce.
[42:46.86]That's enough sauce.
[42:47.62]That's enough sauce.
[42:49.06]That's a good amount of sauce, I think.
[42:51.47]Okay.
[42:51.81]We're going to put that in there.
[42:53.49]Now let's put the cheese on there.
[42:58.22]I think the cheese is supposed to not be solid.
[43:01.65]They're making it look like you can squeeze it out of a bag.
[43:06.54]Spoon the cheese into a plastic sandwich bag and cut a small hole in the corner.
[43:09.76]Squeeze out strings of cheese
[43:22.32]Hey, hey, hey, this is like they do in the restaurants with that big glob of mozzarella.
[43:29.23]See?
[43:29.43]And this is going to spread out.
[43:41.35]Okay, there they are.
[43:46.46]I don't like a lot of cheese on my pizzas.
[43:47.92]How does that look?
[43:50.14]Can you see?
[43:55.93]For some reason on the back of all the Ritz crackers boxes, this is what's on the back every single time.
[44:01.41]I don't know why.
[44:01.85]I don't know who the fuck does that shit.
[44:03.81]I don't know who puts like sauce and like cheese and like Dorito powder on their Ritz crackers.
[44:08.91]But I don't know why they do that.
[44:11.06]All right, now it's ready.
[44:12.74]Time to bake.
[44:15.84]All right, bake for 12 minutes.
[44:17.66]12 fucking minutes.
[44:23.07]I thought this was going to be like 10, 5.
[44:26.03]It's 12.
[44:26.19]All right.
[44:28.73]Now I got to, which way does it go in?
[44:31.89]OK, you go like this.
[44:33.09]Is this the way it goes?
[44:35.68]Like that?
[44:40.20]How does it go?
[44:40.66]I need to know how this works.
[44:48.52]Look at the picture.
[44:53.99]No, it goes in.
[44:55.10]Oh, yeah, the thing on top.
[45:01.61]OK, here we go.
[45:28.39]What if I get stuck in there?
[45:29.91]What if I get stuck in there and I have to pull it out of the wall?
[45:34.66]Is it in there?
[45:37.54]Timer, timer.
[45:38.60]What time is it?
[45:39.10]I don't know, 10 minutes?
[45:42.78]Start the time.
[45:44.36]What time is it right now?
[45:45.33]I don't even have a fucking watch.
[45:47.09]What time is it?
[45:48.59]Is it in?
[45:49.35]Yeah, I think so.
[45:50.51]Yeah, it's in there.
[45:51.89]And then you push it out to the cooling side.
[45:56.65]Timer's on the front of the oven.
[45:58.01]No, that's just a picture.
[45:59.26]That's not real.
[46:01.06]What the fuck am I going to do?
[46:02.18]Oh, I know what I can do for 12 minutes.
[46:04.48]Clean up my area.
[46:06.20]Wow, that sounds like a great idea.
[46:09.24]This is perfect.
[46:10.08]All right, here you go.
[46:12.54]Cleaning screen.
[46:15.33]All right, if you see smoke right there,
[46:24.93]You know what I mean?
[46:25.49]Like that thing is going out of the, I'm ripping that thing out of the fucking wall and I'm gonna stomp on it.
[46:33.65]All right, let's do this part first.
[46:36.48]Check this out, ready?
[46:37.96]Just like those Kathy Mitchell fucking copper pan commercials.
[46:41.24]It's so easy to clean.
[46:43.62]This is, that was so awful.
[46:46.88]That was so awful.
[46:54.73]I feel like I just blew my nose with a sinus infection.
[46:58.94]Okay, you're looking good.
[47:08.32]How much time has it been?
[47:09.76]I'm taking that out after five minutes.
[47:11.16]I don't care.
[47:19.37]It's been two minutes?
[47:20.11]All right.
[47:27.79]Can you guys even hear me?
[47:30.12]There's a timer on the front.
[47:31.68]No, the timer on the front is a picture.
[47:35.38]Don't touch anything.
[47:36.40]The timer on the front, it says 3.30.
[47:38.24]It is a photo.
[47:39.78]It is a fake picture.
[47:41.36]It's a fake photo.
[47:42.36]Oh, by the way, hopefully no shingles coming.
[47:44.86]Oh, damn it.
[47:48.71]Fuck.
[47:49.79]Imagine if I had somebody here with like a seagull on a stick like dropping it and trying to eat shit.
[47:54.77]Whatever.
[47:55.05]Just fucking pretend I did that.
[47:56.91]Add a CG one over here or something eventually.
[47:59.75]The dial.
[48:00.68]This is on or off.
[48:10.98]That's on or off.
[48:12.70]That's not time.
[48:16.28]This is on
[48:17.82]are not on.
[48:19.52]That number right there is a photo.
[48:21.33]It's not real.
[48:25.71]Will you let me just clean up?
[48:26.71]I don't know if you can hear what the fuck I'm saying.
[48:30.87]He's lying.
[48:31.83]No, I'm not lying.
[48:34.38]How hot does it get in there?
[48:35.42]Like 100 degrees.
[48:36.22]I'm so glad I brought this trash bag.
[48:42.56]I was thinking about things that I might really need.
[48:45.81]Thank God I brought this.
[48:49.28]rest of this I'll make sure I'll wipe it up get it nice and cleaned up we can move on to one of the easy ones I want to do an easy one this is called easy bake oven not you needed a bunch of extra and that's not in the box is that loud oh I'm sorry I thought I figured I had to I'm sorry that was really loud I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm apologizing
[49:27.17]It's that nice and ready to be cleaned.
[49:30.89]That can just be disposed of.
[49:37.50]How much time, how much time has it been?
[49:40.86]You fucking assholes.
[49:42.14]Don't say smoke when there's no smoke.
[49:44.04]You just freaked me out.
[49:46.66]Okay.
[49:47.68]It's been four minutes?
[49:50.68]You motherfuckers, I swear to God.
[49:52.22]I actually believed it.
[49:53.86]So many of you were saying it that I was like, no, it has to be real quick.
[49:58.09]Imagine if the EasyBake oven could actually burn shit.
[50:02.55]There's no way it can.
[50:03.25]That thing's going to turn off if there's even 1% problem.
[50:07.95]I have to throw this away.
[50:08.75]That's so sad.
[50:11.43]Go.
[50:13.87]I know the audio is not good.
[50:19.75]It's burning.
[50:31.63]Speak up.
[50:33.35]That's why I let it clean.
[50:35.11]All right, hold on.
[50:41.25]Is that better?
[50:41.79]Can you hear me now?
[50:43.05]I'm just trying to clean up because we have another one to do.
[50:48.57]How much time has it been?
[51:02.92]I want to take it out.
[51:03.86]It scares me.
[51:04.38]Ovens scare me.
[51:05.78]They really do.
[51:06.28]Hey, extra easy bake oven.
[51:08.90]Why would I hold on to this?
[51:17.06]It's not done.
[51:19.05]Look, I can just jam it back in.
[51:22.39]It comes out.
[51:23.15]God, this is a glorified bagel toaster, okay?
[51:26.73]It just goes in and then pushes out the other side.
[51:29.78]I can even probably put a sesame seed bagel in here.
[51:32.80]It would be perfect on the way out.
[51:35.36]Who cares?
[51:35.92]It's not raw.
[51:40.30]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[51:47.03]It's gonna be raw.
[51:47.83]You're not trying hard enough.
[51:52.47]What does that even mean?
[51:52.97]I don't even know that.
[51:53.77]What does that mean?
[51:54.39]I'm just trying to get my area cleaned.
[51:57.53]Just say the same three sentences, Jeremy, while your brain's only capable of doing one thing at a time.
[52:03.87]Cook harder.
[52:05.25]You have no passion.
[52:08.09]Passion for easy bake ovens.
[52:09.41]All right.
[52:15.03]How do you have a passion for an easy bake oven?
[52:18.22]Well, I guess somebody has to have passion for it.
[52:21.48]Somebody has to design this and make this and shit.
[52:25.50]You have to be, you know, there's engineers that were really into this.
[52:31.93]So yeah, you would be very passionate, I would think.
[52:36.67]It's your job to make this, like, cool device that kids can play with and make cupcakes, which, by the way, can't wait to make the fucking three-layered cake.
[52:51.10]oh I want to bring this up too I went way overboard with the costumes for tomorrow way overboard like no human should have ordered and bought this many things there's I don't even I don't even know what to do with it seriously I bought too many things I went overboard but I figured you know maybe you're not going to do it for a while probably ever again who knows okay let's get a little bit of water in here so I can how long has it been time what's my time

[53:26.82]Okay, I can finish this on a BRB screen.
[53:28.96]I don't even have a BRB screen on this computer.
[53:38.77]It's just gonna be like a text on the screen.
[53:44.27]Oh, fuck.
[53:44.91]Fucking rancid.
[53:49.37]Lick the paper towel.
[53:51.73]Oh my God, imagine if he did that.
[53:53.29]It would be disgusting.
[53:57.34]I can't even tell how my hair is.
[53:58.46]All right, I'm going to check on it.
[54:00.02]I'm going to check it.
[54:00.54]All right, I'm going to check on it.
[54:05.78]I'm going to check it.
[54:06.76]I'm going to take it out.
[54:09.21]All right, I got to take it out.
[54:10.13]I got to take it out.
[54:10.59]I have to take it out.
[54:11.63]I'm freaking out.
[54:12.29]I have to take it out.
[54:15.17]I have to take it out now.
[54:17.99]I have one more bowl to wipe and then I have to go and get some rinse in there.
[54:22.51]No, no, chill, chill, chill.
[54:24.09]Three more minutes.
[54:25.37]No, you never do a pizza for the time that it says.
[54:30.16]It's always overdone.
[54:31.08]I hate overdone pizza.
[54:37.94]Okay, looking good.
[54:42.30]Actually, it wasn't even that bad to clean up.
[54:51.11]Almost ready for round two.
[54:53.55]All right, it's going to be audience's choice for what we do for round two.
[54:58.51]Because as you see, we've got quite a selection.
[55:05.11]I'll finish that up in a minute.
[55:07.01]OK, I'm going to check on it.
[55:12.82]It's time.
[55:23.36]I'm checking on it.
[55:24.12]I don't like this.
[55:24.78]I'm doing it.
[55:27.38]Okay, here we go.
[55:28.74]Let's see what we get.
[55:37.00]Don't do it yet.
[55:38.52]It's done!
[55:39.16]It's gonna be done!
[55:41.40]Caution.
[55:41.78]Supervision.
[55:42.24]Electronic toy.
[55:43.84]Unplug when not in danger.
[55:44.94]To prevent electric shock, do not immerse it in water.
[55:48.84]Wipe clean with a damp cloth.
[55:50.30]Immerse in water?
[55:54.98]Like, plugged in?
[55:56.94]Like, dropping it in the water?
[56:00.24]Like a... Like a toaster?
[56:03.28]Don't... Crazy, Bill?
[56:07.42]Imagine dropping an Easy-Bake oven into the fucking bath?
[56:11.73]What are you doing?
[56:13.21]Why are you doing that?
[56:16.53]Bill crazy.
[56:17.39]Alright, and how long has it been?
[56:23.21]Imagine... Okay, it's been... All right, I'm ready.
[56:32.83]Are you ready for the moment of truth?
[56:35.51]Ladies and gentlemen, I'm taking it out here.
[56:37.30]Wait a minute, how do I take this out?
[56:38.58]I don't have any oven mitts.
[56:43.90]I don't... Uh-oh.
[56:45.52]I don't have any oven mitts.
[56:46.90]I swear to God, I don't have any oven mitts.
[56:48.44]I don't have an oven mitt.
[56:50.81]I don't have any oven mitts.
[56:52.74]This has got to be, uh-oh, this is bad.
[56:54.88]This will do, this will do, this will do.
[56:56.51]Just go, okay, this is, right?
[56:57.53]This is a lot of protection.
[56:58.63]Let's check it.
[56:59.41]A lot of protection.
[57:24.98]Did it go in?
[57:26.60]Is it out here?
[57:28.74]It's out, it's out, it's out, it's out.
[57:30.02]All right, I got it.
[57:37.81]Ladies and gentlemen, take a look at, I'm blocking the view.
[57:44.21]Take a look at this delicious mozzarella cheese.
[57:49.31]Ladies and gentlemen, take a look at this, oh.
[57:55.39]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could take a look.
[57:58.36]No, no, no, don't all of you leave.
[57:59.90]Don't all of you leave.
[58:00.60]Stay, stay, stay.
[58:01.78]I promise.
[58:03.86]Take a look at this scrumptious cheese.
[58:07.95]Pizza.
[58:25.67]All right.
[58:28.95]It's the same, wait, did I push it through to the, did this cook?
[58:42.42]Is it raw?
[58:43.48]I think I pushed it too far the first time.
[58:49.97]Did I push it all the way out?
[58:52.94]Alright, I need a plate.
[58:54.06]I don't even... What the fuck is wrong with me?
[58:55.80]Did I even think any of this through?
[58:57.86]Is this hot?
[59:00.58]No.
[59:02.00]What am I so afraid of?
[59:02.86]This is made for five-year-olds.
[59:04.02]Alright.
[59:05.86]No, it's good.
[59:06.80]It's ready.
[59:08.18]And I want you to do me a favor, folks, and I want you to listen to that crunch.
[59:24.43]It's in my teeth.
[59:27.59]It's in my teeth and it won't come out.
[59:29.02]It's like... It's gluing to my fucking canines.
[59:35.34]It's like...
[60:25.67]The thing is, I really appreciate your execution here.
[60:32.75]You used that mozzarella very well.
[60:35.85]In fact, so well, in fact, that it is bonded with the middle of my mouth.
[60:42.30]And I do like the creativity, though, pretending that you're a child.
[60:47.04]That's really, really nice of you to do that.
[60:49.31]You know, the childlike way that you cooked in the kitchen.
[60:52.45]But I will say...
[60:57.10]for those reasons I'm out those are the two shows that I combined Chopped and Shark Tank that's how fast this fucking brain goes now get the fuck out of here okay it's like seriously not even that bad but it is and I like I have to like brush my teeth this is seriously gonna stay this is not coming off Jesus Christ
[61:32.53]I'm not going to eat them all.
[61:34.15]No.
[61:34.31]Hey, but I made this, though.
[61:41.01]Well, there's why you need the cooking spray.
[61:44.55]That's fantastic.
[61:48.57]Not really, though.
[61:49.22]It's fine.
[61:56.56]That's not going to come off.
[61:57.70]We're going to have dough on here.
[61:59.04]I have to, like, scrub this with a fucking knife.
[62:03.15]Yeah, I got it.
[62:09.30]I got it.
[62:09.98]It's fine.
[62:12.08]Okay, coming up next, we're going to make some cookies or something.
[62:17.50]I don't know.
[62:18.70]What are we doing?
[62:20.56]Whatever this one is.
[62:22.70]Oh, this is the cake one.
[62:23.68]Red, velvet, and strawberry cakes.
[62:27.28]Look at the image.
[62:29.30]I can't.
[62:30.16]I don't have access.
[62:30.84]I don't have access to a computer right now.
[62:34.47]Alright.
[62:35.83]Let me go ahead and feed this to the... No.
[62:52.02]No, I'm sorry.
[62:52.82]I'm sorry.
[62:53.30]I'm not going to do that.
[62:56.42]You wasted... I'm sorry.
[62:57.36]I'm not eating all those.
[62:59.13]I took two bites and it was good.
[63:01.99]You're wasting the food.
[63:06.84]Guys, 95% of that was flour.
[63:18.06]I didn't like it.
[63:18.64]It's in my esophagus.
[63:25.55]No, I gotta drink this.
[63:27.09]No, I can't.
[63:31.25]I was about to just slam that.
[63:35.71]All right, I'll be right back with some more of this fun cooking program.
[63:39.83]Okay, stop doing the fucking jokey guy and just get it over with.
[63:47.63]My teeth, I think my teeth might be stained forever.
[63:50.61]What if I had just like two black teeth up here for the rest of my life?
[63:55.45]I imagine having to go to the dentist and tell them like that you need your teeth fixed.
[64:00.61]Well, what happened?
[64:01.41]Well, you know, I ate food from an Easy-Bake oven that I undercooked.
[64:10.07]All right.
[64:11.23]All right.
[64:11.53]Give me a minute.
[64:12.27]Let me go, like, get this ready.
[64:13.67]I'll put on some music and whatever.
[64:18.23]I got to get ready for round two, which is easy.
[64:20.97]I want an easy one.
[64:24.03]Okay.
[64:25.93]All right.
[64:27.21]All right.
[64:27.91]Give me a minute.
[64:29.49]Let me, like, finish this shit, what I was doing before.
[64:39.45]Seriously, this is the shit that was in my teeth.
[64:44.91]And no wonder, it like is not coming out of this either.
[64:49.67]I have to run this through a dishwasher like four times.
[65:02.22]Unplug the oven, why?
[65:10.77]It's fine.
[65:12.81]The thing's meant to be turned on, and it's got to be preheated.
[65:15.13]All right.
[65:21.91]Is this hot?
[65:24.99]No.
[65:25.05]All right, this is... We start with you.
[65:35.32]It's going to take equal amount of time to clean these bowls to be ready, because I...
[65:41.86]At some point, you have to say, who cares?
[65:43.56]And some of your brownies are going to taste like cheese.
[65:47.50]I can't hear him.
[65:48.12]Hello?
[65:48.40]All right, this one's good.
[65:51.50]This one's ready.
[65:56.00]Clean, right?
[65:59.90]That one's done.
[66:01.47]Next one, coming up.
[66:03.91]Hold on.
[66:05.93]I'm B.O.B.
[66:06.53]right now.
[66:06.79]I'm not even here.
[66:16.49]Okay, next up, this one.
[66:19.17]Almost ready.
[66:24.71]What if I run out of paper?
[66:25.49]Oh, fuck.
[66:26.87]Okay, I gotta really conserve these.
[66:38.18]Where is he?
[66:38.74]What are you talking about?
[66:39.56]I'm right here.
[66:49.21]You know, 2020 is always hindsight, right?
[66:52.87]But I should have done this outside and just had, like, a hose somewhere that I could just spray into all this stuff and to be ready to go.
[66:57.87]Okay.
[67:06.45]This is ready for round two.
[67:12.39]Done.
[67:13.97]This one.
[67:15.21]Almost...
[67:19.80]I can't see him.
[67:20.82]I'm right here.
[67:21.60]What are you talking about?
[67:23.50]You are outside.
[67:24.82]I'm pretend outside.
[67:25.82]All right.
[67:31.42]At some point, I'm going to have to just kind of let this thing, like it ain't going to happen because then I'm going to have to just use another bowl because I have another fresh one right there.
[67:41.76]You know what?
[67:42.08]This is... No, it's coming up.
[67:49.23]It's good.
[67:50.10]Just going to take a minute.
[67:54.90]See, the real smart person thing to do would be to have somebody hired to have two bowl sets, and one person's cleaning the bowls while I'm doing set number two.
[68:04.46]I need a fucking god damn assistant.
[68:10.66]Stop wiping us.
[68:14.17]Oh, there we go.
[68:14.89]Sorry about that.
[68:19.75]This stuff is fucking acid.
[68:22.39]It's still coming up!
[68:26.47]Why?
[68:30.17]It's like... Am I wiping off the dye on the bowl?
[68:34.31]Or is this still the sauce?
[68:42.82]Holy shit, that's loud.
[68:45.54]Gmod mic?
[68:48.73]I can go up there and I can turn it down and I'm going to go do that.
[68:51.79]This is almost ready.
[68:53.57]What am I making?
[68:54.81]You guys have seen what's up there.
[68:55.89]We've got pretzels.
[68:56.67]I'm not making the pretzels right now.
[68:58.01]I don't want any more disgusting, smelly, savory food.
[69:00.89]I'll gag.
[69:02.98]What have we got?
[69:08.94]There's brownies there.
[69:10.84]Actually, I would eat the brownies.
[69:13.76]Real food is gross when it comes to toys.
[69:16.90]Real food is disgusting.
[69:18.73]It... Nobody wants to eat, like, real food coming out of something like this.
[69:25.57]Nobody does.
[69:27.23]But, like, candy and the cookies and stuff?
[69:30.28]That's fine.
[69:31.12]It's... No.
[69:32.80]Nobody wants to eat, like, a fucking hot dog in an oven like this.
[69:39.30]Guys, sugar, flour, salt, and baking soda is like what a cookie is made out of, right?
[69:46.14]But like, if there was like hamburgers in here, I wouldn't want like powdered hamburger meat.
[69:50.94]I don't want to eat like powdered cheese.
[69:53.46]I don't want to eat like powdered marinara sauce.
[69:56.42]There's no such thing as a powdered tomato, okay?
[69:58.88]No such thing.
[70:00.52]To make a brownie, it's just like chocolate powder, sugar, eggs, salt.
[70:05.50]It's not powdered tomatoes, okay?
[70:09.35]Like that shit was.
[70:16.85]Okay.
[70:17.71]This is good to go?
[70:20.85]Yep.
[70:22.59]Alright.
[70:23.91]That one's ready.
[70:25.31]One more and we're done.
[70:28.87]Actually, I'm going to take a second to just get this water cleared out.
[70:34.20]And then we can keep going.
[70:38.74]Yeah, I don't need, like, this one, this was the most complicated one.
[70:46.23]Nope.
[70:56.26]Nope.
[70:59.50]I ain't spending 20 minutes cleaning that.
[71:00.98]Okay.
[71:01.74]Okay.
[71:04.80]Just get a new one, forehead.
[71:07.06]Just get a new one.
[71:09.48]This is not the garbage bowl.
[71:11.38]Good point.
[71:23.76]Look, all pans are gonna have some, like, decay on them.
[71:28.23]You know what I mean?
[71:31.87]Like, you're never gonna get a pan clean.
[71:33.43]Oh, no.
[71:39.95]You're never gonna get a pan fully clean like this.
[71:44.93]My ears!
[71:59.46]My whole body is on fire.
[72:05.50]Fuck!
[72:07.24]I went like this, and my nail... nail on the chalkboard, like... Fuck, I just screamed in your ear!
[72:20.57]Okay, fucking whatever.
[72:23.09]Don't do it again.
[72:44.79]Give me a fucking easy one!
[72:46.93]Goddamn.
[72:49.09]Gotta get some elbow grease in it.
[72:50.43]That's how you get it done.
[72:51.29]Look at that.
[73:04.22]Fuck his brain?
[73:05.92]You saying fuck my brain, or are you saying, like, oh no, his brain?
[73:12.73]Alrighty, are we ready for the next delicious treat?
[73:15.64]I have to turn the microphone down.
[73:22.35]Garbage bowl, you're right.
[74:59.50]What's next?
[74:59.88]What are we doing?
[75:01.88]Ooh, whoopie pies.
[75:07.45]Let's do whoopie pies.
[75:17.85]Those actually look... Those look kind of good.
[75:21.96]Okay, are we good?
[75:26.84]So these...
[75:28.85]Two chocolate brownie mixes and two... this is gonna be so much easier.
[75:33.04]Thank God.
[75:36.06]It's actually just two or three packets, not like six.
[75:47.02]Thank God.
[75:47.50]Alright, chocolate brownie mix.
[75:51.77]Yeah, you get two of them just in case you wanna go crazy.
[75:55.29]Yeah, this is going to be so much better.
[75:57.01]Vanilla frosting mix.
[75:59.11]It's just two fucking things.
[76:01.15]Thank goodness.
[76:05.46]Alright, clean as you go.
[76:07.52]Clean as you go.
[76:09.22]Clean as you go.
[76:10.80]Clean as you go.
[76:13.00]Clean as you go.
[76:20.01]Turn the oven on.
[76:23.36]Oh, shit.
[76:25.78]That would have been bad.
[76:30.61]Alright, this one will be nice and quick, I think.
[76:35.63]I don't even... Do I even need... Should I try to do one of these without the instructions?
[76:38.57]Like, fuck it.
[76:39.21]Just do... Dump brownie mix into the fucking container and then dump vanilla frosting into the container.
[76:46.44]I need water.
[77:48.80]I'm about to throw that bowl in the trash.
[77:53.67]You know what I mean?
[77:54.51]Like... I'm thinking about just throwing that in the trash.
[77:59.67]But, I mean, it's like plastic.
[78:01.35]I can't do that.
[78:02.63]That's terrible.
[78:04.07]Okay, here we go.
[78:06.01]Chocolate brownie.
[78:08.49]Surprise!
[78:09.79]What's the surprise?
[78:13.15]Marinara sauce on the bottom.
[78:16.53]Okay, here we are.
[78:19.04]One and a half teaspoons of water, stir until it's nice and thick.
[78:32.06]Okay.
[78:33.28]Ooh, this looks nice.
[78:34.70]I actually like the way this looks.
[78:38.52]Okay.
[78:39.26]It smells like just hot chocolate powder, which is like, let me tell you something.
[78:48.71]Nesquik cocoa powder just even like chocolate milk powder tell me if you guys think I'm a sick fuck for doing this I guarantee some of you guys do it too you just you stir in a little bit just like you know maybe one tablespoon into your milk and you get it a little bit there and then you sprinkle on top a layer of powder on top of the milk
[79:10.83]So it becomes this disgusting sludge.
[79:14.05]And you take a sip.
[79:15.61]After you let it wait, sit on the top for about 10 to 20 seconds.
[79:18.65]Take a little sip.
[79:19.75]And you suck up the wet powder.
[79:22.23]And it's like, I'm telling you, try it if you don't.
[79:25.66]I'm telling you.
[79:29.96]Actually, this is good to have a big bowl.
[79:33.48]No, I did do that.
[79:34.56]Yeah.
[79:35.12]I mean, I don't do this anymore.
[79:36.42]I'm a grown man.
[79:41.08]Alright, uh, do I, okay, where's my stirring thing?
[79:47.82]This smells very good.
[79:49.73]This smells way better than powdered tomato sauce.
[79:53.39]Alright, let's get our spatula, and let's, uh, let's work with it here.
[79:58.05]What do you say?
[79:59.13]I'm trying to see.
[80:01.52]Hey, let's actually move this out of the way.
[80:05.26]L-U-L, poop wine.
[80:06.94]It's chocolate.
[80:09.19]Oh, I get it.
[80:09.85]It's... hey!
[80:11.27]Hey, it's... it's brown in there!
[80:13.55]It must be poo-poo!
[80:16.77]Come on, guys.
[80:17.85]Grow up.
[80:31.86]How does this only need one and a half tablespoons of water?
[80:39.55]Can somebody explain that to me?
[80:42.17]Because this is not even close.
[80:44.69]I need way more water than this.
[80:53.40]I think I might even need more than that.
[80:54.64]You need like a cup of water in here.
[80:58.70]You didn't add one and a half.
[81:00.84]What?
[81:02.07]Yes, I did.
[81:06.19]I've got to get in there.
[81:13.68]Imagine being a parent and having your kid ask to do this on a given day.
[81:20.50]This is one of those things where you just don't want to hear those words.
[81:26.12]No, can't you like go outside and just like throw shit around?
[81:30.50]I don't want to do this.
[81:32.81]Who wants to do this?
[81:35.03]What parent wants to actually have to go through the trouble with this shit?
[81:40.55]Why don't you just make food?
[81:43.00]Why don't you make actual brownies?
[81:44.34]Like, why do you need this weird little fucking bagel toaster?
[81:48.18]Just make a brownie.
[81:49.18]Just make brownies in your oven, in your actual oven.
[81:51.32]What's this for?
[81:53.69]What is this for?
[81:55.33]What is it for?
[81:58.81]I don't get it.
[82:00.27]It's for kids.
[82:01.05]Okay, kids can cook too.
[82:02.75]You need supervision for this.
[82:04.84]Caution.
[82:05.62]Supervision required.
[82:08.00]So if you need supervision to use this, you need supervision to use a real oven, so what's the deal?
[82:13.51]What's the problem?
[82:15.17]This actually looks pretty syrupy and pretty soupy and pretty delicious.
[82:20.49]It says mix concoction until it gets all syrupy and savory and soupy.
[82:26.17]I got it there.
[82:26.70]All right, that looks good.
[82:31.56]Damn, this looks fucking good.
[82:35.51]I did a good job!
[82:36.63]This is from scratch!
[82:37.59]This isn't me doing this shit!
[82:38.62]It's too loud!
[82:39.78]Might be.
[82:40.24]Okay.
[82:41.18]Now we do the frosting.
[82:45.00]Easy Bake Vanilla Frosting.
[82:46.16]We'll do it in here.
[82:47.99]Wait, was this the one with the cheese in it?
[82:51.63]Whatever.
[82:51.87]Okay, now what does it want me to do?
[82:54.71]Just water?
[82:57.84]Cheese frosting.
[83:06.47]What?
[83:09.77]We don't do this yet.
[83:13.67]Okay.
[83:15.01]Roll these mixtures into balls.
[83:20.73]I need two... Wait, what?
[83:30.41]Already?
[83:33.70]That might light on fire.
[83:36.57]I can't... Okay.
[83:37.83]Sprinkle flour on... Okay, so... Wait, this is supposed to be turned into a ball?
[83:47.94]That's not going to turn into a ball!
[83:51.91]Hold on.
[83:56.23]Just eat it out of the bowl.
[84:00.75]Just eat it out of the fucking bowl.
[84:02.95]Ah, that was fun, easy, big oven.
[84:06.35]Wow.
[84:08.89]Okay.
[84:09.15]Wait, are you supposed to cook this?
[84:16.13]Is this like rotten?
[84:19.92]Wait, do I, are you supposed to cook that?
[84:22.00]Is it raw?
[84:32.41]It stinks in here!
[84:35.33]Oh my god, it smells in there!
[84:37.84]It fucking stinks in there!
[84:39.54]It smells... Oh my god, it smells like a college dorm room in here!
[84:51.42]No!
[84:58.75]I have to go to the dentist after this one.
[85:05.48]Okay.
[85:06.50]So you can't eat it raw.
[85:07.26]It has to be baked, because there's like raw cookie dough in there.
[85:13.08]I can fix this, though.
[85:14.42]Because there's two of these.
[85:16.26]I'm going to add this very slowly.
[85:18.35]You know, you can make a mistake.
[85:19.27]You can make a mistake or two.
[85:20.17]It's fine.
[85:29.33]It's okay to make a mistake.
[85:31.47]You can fix it in post.
[85:32.19]Post.
[85:33.82]This is the video editing of the cooking world.
[85:37.03]You just add a little bit more powder.
[85:39.89]Slowly.
[85:40.71]And get it in there.
[85:44.75]Wait till it's all syrupy and soupy and thick and savory.
[85:50.21]How am I ever going to put this into a ball?
[85:53.45]Should I just spread this on there?
[86:00.68]What if I just spread this onto the pan?
[86:04.35]and make it, like, just on the pan and then put the frosting on top so it's just a big cake.
[86:10.23]What's wrong with that?
[86:11.05]It'll still work.
[86:16.44]This is not gonna turn into a ball.
[86:26.50]Right?
[86:27.10]No.
[86:33.93]I swear to God, chefs definitely just sit there while they're doing this and going like, oh my God, this is fucking wrong.
[86:40.09]This is so wrong.
[86:41.57]This is the wrongest thing I've ever done.
[86:43.06]This is not fucking right.
[86:44.48]This is wrong.
[86:45.20]And then like cut to the guy bringing it out and being like, here is your salmon, sir.
[86:49.94]The chef prepared it fresh for you.
[86:52.10]I swear to God, like this is, this shit's impossible.
[86:54.10]This is impossible.
[87:01.27]I'm just making a chocolate bowl.
[87:09.60]Okay.
[87:11.72]Okay, this is not... I'm just gonna do the thing I said I was gonna do.
[87:14.38]Let's try it.
[87:29.23]More powder?
[87:30.21]What the fuck?
[87:33.55]I'm not gonna be able to even move it!
[87:35.08]What do you mean, more powder?
[87:40.87]This is like one of the things I'm too tall for.
[87:42.69]How does that make any sense?
[88:13.67]Now what?
[88:15.61]Remember, this is for kids.
[88:18.17]Yeah, more powder?
[88:25.06]Make balls, make balls.
[88:29.58]I'm not sure I can do that with this.
[88:31.50]It's just going to fall apart.
[88:32.52]Look at this.
[88:33.69]It's too goopy.
[88:36.81]Don't put any more powder.
[88:39.27]Are you following the recipe?
[88:40.45]Yeah.
[88:41.97]Pour one chocolate brownie mix and add one and a half teaspoons of water.
[88:46.82]I think maybe there doesn't... I think there does need to be more powder.
[88:49.96]Right?
[88:53.70]I think so, because otherwise... A teaspoon.
[88:58.71]Yeah, but it was... I couldn't even work with it.
[89:00.25]It was so powdery.
[89:01.13]It was impossible.
[89:09.86]God, this is annoying.
[89:11.92]Just go to Dunkin' Donuts.
[89:14.09]Just get one.
[89:16.99]They have like 60 bowls.
[89:23.39]Alright, hold on.
[89:23.87]It's coming together.
[89:33.12]I might be able to actually turn this into a ball now.
[89:35.42]I'm only going to make like a couple of these, I think.
[89:45.40]This is so... Alright, this is starting to get hard to do.
[89:51.77]More powder.
[89:56.69]Are you sure?
[90:00.03]Yes.
[90:00.31]Alright, I'm not putting any more.
[90:13.00]I'm not doing any more powder after this.
[90:14.28]This is it.
[90:23.07]This is terrible.
[90:26.79]Oh my god!
[90:28.45]What is this even supposed to do?
[90:31.58]How do you fuck up one ingredient bag?
[90:34.30]I don't understand.
[90:35.40]I think I need the other tool.
[90:39.26]This is going to be impossible.
[90:42.74]I think I gotta get in there with my hands, but I can't get in there with my... Oh, there we go.
[90:45.90]Look at that.
[90:46.22]I can scrape the bottom.
[90:48.04]Alright, what do you think?
[90:51.80]Is it ready?
[90:56.05]What do you think?
[90:59.23]That looks a little frothy.
[91:02.67]Maybe a little bit more powder?
[91:08.47]Just a little bit?
[91:12.65]Spitting it.
[91:14.21]You're making a lot of dad noises.
[91:23.97]Fuck.
[91:24.61]Whatever.
[91:26.44]Okay, this is definitely ready.
[91:28.88]Maybe a little bit more powder.
[91:30.44]I don't know.
[91:31.62]I've never made brownies before, guys.
[91:32.94]I don't know what it's supposed to look like.
[91:35.34]I was hoping that there would be pictures in here to show me.
[91:39.27]I think this is good.
[91:40.37]It's very stringy.
[91:41.55]All right, I'm just going to try to get a bunch of it, and then I'm going to have it be a ball.
[91:48.35]Okay, and then what?
[91:49.81]What?
[91:52.63]Oh, these are whoopie pies.
[91:54.79]These are not brownies.
[91:55.87]Why are you guys saying brownies?
[91:57.09]They're whoopie pies.
[91:58.07]They're not supposed to be brownies.
[92:04.25]Okay.
[92:09.56]So we need to make two.
[92:10.66]We're going to make one.
[92:11.90]I'm only doing four.
[92:12.94]I'm doing one, two, and one, two.
[92:14.52]Okay?
[92:21.69]How am I going to do this?
[92:39.08]Turn on the oven.
[92:40.52]The oven is on!
[92:42.13]The oven's powered on.
[92:47.35]Okay, before I do this, I've got to get this prepared.
[92:49.57]I've got to be ready for this.
[92:51.63]This is gonna be a disaster.
[92:54.39]Okay.
[92:55.55]I gotta be ready with this just right here waiting for me.
[93:08.40]I can't turn this into a ball!
[93:11.28]Into a ball?!
[93:17.98]This is just how a child eats dessert!
[93:23.54]Okay, it's almost a ball.
[93:27.56]It's getting there.
[93:28.70]And then I have to spread it out on here.
[93:37.31]Oh, shit.
[93:55.44]Can I just make Hershey's Kisses instead?
[93:56.96]Okay, there's one.
[93:59.94]I feel like when the baby, oh no, the baby got on the counter and is just eating the chocolate out of the bowl.
[94:22.36]This is the baby.
[94:23.28]This is the baby is on the counter.
[94:25.89]Like, Jared, my husband, where the fuck are you?
[94:28.91]What are you doing?
[94:29.59]Why are you letting him do that?
[94:30.81]Are you going to let the baby eat on the counter?
[94:39.20]What are you, fucking stupid?
[94:40.30]I don't... Oh, right, sorry.
[94:44.38]Hey, get off that counter.
[94:50.39]I can make one.
[94:54.55]He's supposed to make a ball!
[94:57.07]Hold on.
[95:00.58]There we go, sometimes you just gotta get in there.
[95:02.32]Alright, I'm gonna make one.
[95:05.42]I'm gonna make one Whoopie Pie.
[95:22.17]This is bad.
[95:22.89]This is bad.
[95:24.07]I feel like people are going to... People are going to share this clip.
[95:31.56]Fucking god damn it.
[95:33.38]I can't make a ball.
[95:34.72]It needs more powder, I think.
[95:43.70]There's no way I can do this.
[95:46.18]I'm going to barf.
[96:03.04]It said, use your hands!
[96:08.26]What a mess!
[96:09.38]Now I have to, like, spend an hour cleaning this up.
[96:13.75]I got, okay, I have, we're going to do an open-faced turkey sandwich type, uh, whoopie pie here.
[96:20.57]Whoopie pie.
[96:21.93]Open-faced.
[96:22.63]I have one on there.
[96:27.38]It's, it's, this is starting to solidify on my hands.
[96:32.34]I don't know what to do.
[96:33.16]I don't know what I'm doing.
[96:35.56]I'll try as hard as I can to get one other ball.
[96:53.18]Smoke!
[96:54.06]Wait!
[96:54.42]Get that out of there!
[96:56.62]Okay, this is... New plan.
[97:00.22]New plan, new plan, new plan.
[97:02.12]I got one.
[97:02.66]This is, it's solid now.
[97:07.03]Yeah, this one's, this one's trashed.
[97:08.27]This one's trashed.
[97:13.39]Eating pho.
[97:20.00]Fuck!
[97:24.58]What the?
[97:29.67]There's only one way out of this.
[97:30.81]I have to eat my way out.
[97:33.69]There's only one way out of this.
[97:54.38]Don't laugh.
[97:55.84]If I laugh, it's gonna go fucking everywhere.
[97:59.12]Don't fucking laugh.
[98:00.63]Focus.
[98:06.41]Focus.
[98:09.21]I'm gonna have to move you guys a little bit.
[98:11.85]I can't fucking... I just... Stop eating this?
[98:28.54]What?! !
[98:36.73]I'm stuck.
[98:39.71]I'm actually stuck.
[98:41.91]I can't move.
[98:43.07]I can't go anywhere.
[98:43.67]I can't turn the stream off.
[98:47.08]I can't go anywhere.
[98:50.42]I literally can't move.
[98:51.28]I'm going to have to sit here for the rest of my life.
[99:20.94]Is there an easy one in here?
[99:27.30]Just save scum.
[99:28.86]I wish.
[99:29.76]Is there an easy one?
[99:31.24]Okay, I'm making this.
[99:32.10]I'm going to do the frosting.
[99:32.94]I'm not giving up on this one.
[99:34.30]I still, I got a dollop on there.
[99:35.43]We're going to make a fucking brownie with extra frosting on it.
[99:39.65]I just have to not have this all over me.
[99:45.29]I'm like in trouble.
[99:48.59]I have to pick this up with my mouth.
[100:02.93]Why did I pick this up with my fucking hands?
[100:04.85]What a joke.
[100:05.55]What an idiot.
[100:07.26]Like, what a dope.
[100:20.15]This thing's, like, preheated.
[100:31.68]I hope you like a guy that is 35 years old almost that is stuck in his chair because he couldn't figure out how to do the brownies on the Easy-Bake Oven and now he is actually fucked because he can't move and now I have to go wash my body.
[100:49.89]I have to go take a shower.
[101:00.74]They're not brownies.
[101:01.60]Whatever, we'll see what they are when they come out of the oven.
[101:05.34]I need a cupcake pan.
[101:07.47]That doesn't say that on there.
[101:08.49]It says put them on the tray.
[101:12.41]Click the link.
[101:14.13]Oh, fuck.
[101:15.27]Oh, yeah!
[101:16.15]Click the link!
[101:17.43]Let me just reach for my mouse and grab it.
[101:20.97]Yeah, I can't do that right now.
[101:23.25]I told you, I'm stuck forever.
[101:25.17]Alright, I'm good.
[101:26.07]Here we go.
[101:27.32]I'll be right back.
[101:28.79]Okay, now I'm at that point where I can literally clean myself up.
[101:33.79]What a fucking disaster.
[101:36.11]Why would I fucking do this with my hands?
[101:38.09]I should have... Huh.
[101:45.92]Now that's a thought.
[101:49.68]Now that's a thought.
[101:53.60]In this guy, right here.
[102:01.37]I can make a ball in my mouth.
[102:05.35]And then just, like, off-camera, just put it on there.
[102:09.30]No, what do you mean, what?
[102:12.02]I'm gonna, like, form it in my mouth, like, and then just spit it out.
[102:17.06]Don't do that.
[102:17.84]Don't.
[102:18.06]There's an audio delay.
[102:20.10]How is there an audio delay?
[102:22.99]I have one.
[102:23.53]I'll, like, here, I'll just, I just, we have one.
[102:25.53]We have a whoopie pie.
[102:26.19]It's done.
[102:26.51]It's done.
[102:32.52]All right.
[102:34.18]I have to get... Okay, this is going to be weird.
[102:35.92]I can't grab this, but this is going to be... It's going to be loud, so just turn your volume down because I'm going to literally just like Wile E. Coyote yank this off my head.
[103:21.94]Can't open the door.
[103:23.88]I can't grab the doorknob.
[103:27.53]I can't grab the doorknob to get out of here.
[103:30.27]I got it, I'm good.
[103:37.45]Didn't even need to.
[105:11.14]Look, I'm clean.
[105:11.44]Alright, let me clean this shit up a little bit here.
[105:20.98]This is why cooking sucks, okay?
[105:26.24]Where are you?
[105:27.02]This is why cooking sucks, okay?
[105:29.30]Because it's just a shitload of cleaning.
[105:31.80]You clean for like six times more than you cook.
[105:35.40]You cook for like six minutes and you clean for like two hours.
[105:40.10]This is why cooking sucks.
[105:46.86]Alright, I'm gonna make the frosting.
[105:48.20]Time for the frosting.
[105:49.12]Okay, cool.
[105:50.88]Nothing preheated?
[105:52.14]Nice.
[105:52.81]Very, very nice.
[105:57.59]Get rid of that.
[105:58.21]That's... I don't... I'm gonna have to put them all in the same bowl.
[106:11.26]I'll click it.
[106:12.14]I'll click it.
[106:12.52]I'll fix the volume, too.
[106:16.08]Just give me one sec.
[106:20.96]You know, it's kind of remarkable.
[106:23.06]I've not gotten a single damn thing anywhere.
[106:27.51]Anywhere but right here.
[106:29.97]That's remarkable.
[106:32.15]Okay.
[106:32.97]Frosting time.
[106:34.09]After I click on the link, I'll take a break.
[106:38.43]Hold on a second.
[106:40.62]Like, this is through the... COOKIES!
[106:55.64]Hi.
[106:56.67]Where's the link?
[107:00.45]Oh, you got a link for me?
[107:23.86]I can't... You're doing it too fast.
[107:29.14]You're doing it way too fast.
[107:30.44]I can't even click it.
[107:34.43]Holy shit.
[107:36.75]Oh my god, that looks horrible.
[107:41.87]It looks like I got in a hockey fight.
[107:45.47]Ugh!
[107:51.18]How many more of these are there?
[107:54.06]That's the wrong one?
[107:54.84]What do you mean, wrong one?
[107:59.14]I can't... Spray the cupcakes... That doesn't... That's not on my book!
[108:16.25]That's not on my book!
[108:24.54]Hey!
[108:26.28]Read that!
[108:29.50]That's not a cupcake pan.
[108:30.81]A special pan?
[108:45.66]Place the six flat cakes on the sprayed baking pan.
[108:49.80]I got scammed.
[108:50.52]Whatever.
[108:52.04]Whatever, whatever, that's fine.
[108:53.62]Any more pictures you want me to look at before I go fucking ruin my reputation as an adult human being?
[109:03.75]Yeah, I saw that one.
[109:04.45]All right, I'm back to it.
[109:17.83]You bought, hold on.
[109:19.84]You're going too fast.
[109:21.98]You bought the easy bake oven instead of the easy cupcake oven.
[109:24.87]That's a lie.
[109:25.97]Easy fake oven.
[109:26.99]Whatever.
[109:29.09]So it's fucked up.
[109:32.10]Who cares?
[109:32.46]Alright, I'm going back over there.
[109:49.56]Any scraps for me?
[110:01.93]Could you see me?
[110:04.61]Could you see my face?
[110:10.71]Yeah?
[110:11.01]Okay.
[110:13.47]Oh, look!
[110:16.25]Hey!
[110:16.65]Wish I had the cupcake pan, don't you?
[110:23.14]That was disgusting.
[110:25.32]Just leave.
[110:25.88]Just go.
[110:26.40]Go.
[110:26.70]Trust me.
[110:27.10]Just go.
[110:27.44]That's the end.
[110:28.00]That's the end of this, Chief.
[110:30.13]See you later.
[110:31.33]That was bad.
[110:32.47]You're free to go.
[110:33.17]You are.
[110:33.47]I need my instructions.
[110:39.85]No, I don't even need my instructions.
[110:41.27]It's water.
[110:46.46]I don't have any water.
[111:38.38]Cupcakes.
[111:39.70]Cupcakes.
[111:40.70]Cupcakes.
[111:41.64]Cupcakes.
[111:42.58]Cupcakes.
[111:43.98]Cupcakes.
[111:45.12]Who wants some cupcakes?
[111:50.61]A bunch of people did leave.
[111:53.89]A bunch of people did leave.
[111:55.11]Yeah, because I just pretended to blow a snot into the food.
[111:59.69]Like, I would have left.
[112:00.45]I would have been like, okay, who else?
[112:02.86]Somebody else has to be fucking streaming.
[112:07.01]I have to do this whole thing in here?
[112:08.65]Oh, I don't know about that.
[112:10.99]This is a lot.
[112:11.79]This fucking sucks!
[112:20.18]Imagine having to cook with real food?
[112:25.38]Imagine cooking with real ingredients?
[112:37.46]Okay.
[112:39.02]What's next?
[112:43.27]Oh, I'm supposed to cook this.
[112:44.81]Sure.
[112:45.21]Okay.
[112:46.39]So just put it in.
[112:50.43]There's only one, but whatever.
[112:52.35]What am I going to do about it?
[112:55.55]How long?
[112:59.82]Twelve fucking minutes.
[113:01.12]No way.
[113:02.26]It's definitely not twelve minutes.
[113:14.05]Not for one, I know.
[113:15.69]Alright, let's make the frog.
[113:16.69]This is going to be the delicious part.
[113:18.73]I am excited for this one.
[113:27.38]Oh, yeah.
[113:29.20]Mm-hmm.
[113:30.38]Yep.
[113:31.12]Mm-hmm.
[113:32.40]Oh, yeah.
[113:33.72]Hey.
[113:34.98]Smell that.
[113:36.39]Smell that one.
[113:37.81]That's just like vanilla powder.
[113:43.55]Okay, I don't need to make that much frosting for one little cake.
[113:50.11]This is too much frosting, I think.
[113:52.53]This is going to be the most savory.
[113:54.33]I can't wait.
[113:56.07]Look, just say words that have to do with food, and people will think you know what you're talking about.
[114:00.15]Alright, that one's done.
[114:03.64]Okay.
[114:05.14]Um, where's that spoon?
[114:07.98]We need some water.
[114:12.38]How much water?
[114:15.99]One and a half teaspoons.
[114:24.40]I think that's it, right?
[114:26.68]And then mix it up.
[114:29.24]I gotta move the vomit ball out of the way.
[114:32.03]Okay, here we go.
[114:47.48]So I'm not going to add any more water.
[114:48.94]I'm not going to be a psycho about this.
[114:50.66]It's not really, as you can see, it's... Mix it faster.
[114:57.30]No, that's not how you... You don't mix it faster.
[114:59.21]It's not better.
[115:00.27]It's slow and slow.
[115:02.95]Time on that one.
[115:03.89]Time on this one.
[115:04.49]What was it?
[115:07.05]When did I put it in?
[115:11.72]Nine minutes left?
[115:12.36]Okay.
[115:12.48]Okay.
[115:21.94]I don't want to make a fucking mess.
[115:39.97]Faster, faster!
[115:41.07]What the fuck?
[115:43.17]This is frosting?
[115:46.31]Vanilla frosting.
[115:57.47]This doesn't look like frosting.
[116:02.91]Did I do too much fucking water again?
[116:04.61]I did a teaspoon.
[116:08.56]I did it this time.
[116:09.32]I did one and a half.
[116:10.62]You saw me.
[116:12.50]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[116:13.18]This is reducing.
[116:15.50]Hey, this is reducing.
[116:18.02]It's another one of those cooking words that they say on Food Network.
[116:24.46]Yeah, okay.
[116:25.40]No, look at it.
[116:30.55]Yeah, it's thickening up.
[116:41.62]Time on that.
[116:43.88]You're going too fast.
[116:45.72]You know what?
[116:46.00]I need to... I'm about to fucking knock this out of the way.
[116:48.62]There we go.
[116:55.41]Should I give it a taste?
[116:57.35]What is it supposed to taste like?
[116:59.89]frosting.
[117:02.45]Yeah, this is looking like a glaze.
[117:08.32]Yeah, it looks alright.
[117:10.42]It's supposed to ban that person.
[117:13.96]Ban that person.
[117:14.94]You know who you are and you know what you said.
[117:17.50]Ban them.
[117:18.54]I don't want to see their face ever again.
[117:19.88]I don't want to even hear them in this chat.
[117:24.54]You know what you said and you know who you are and now you're fucking being like, holy shit, he's talking about me.
[117:28.57]Yeah, ban him.
[117:31.98]for at least a week.
[117:33.68]Maybe you'll learn your lesson.
[117:34.70]What have we got for time on that?
[117:47.25]Eight more minutes?
[117:47.97]No, it's not.
[117:48.47]It's like four.
[117:53.99]Alright, this is ready.
[117:56.79]This is nice and mixed.
[117:59.50]It's got a nice honey glaze consistency.
[118:02.50]It's going to be a nice drizzle on our cake.
[118:14.95]What else do I have here?
[118:18.87]Oh, look at this shit!
[118:20.77]But I don't like have... I need to like... Or... Wait, what about the pretzels?
[118:27.61]Should I make the pretzels?
[118:29.88]I can make a pretty... I'm gonna make a huge pretzel.
[118:32.14]Yep.
[118:34.38]No, who wants to eat these?
[118:37.78]Yeah, I'm gonna make a big pretzel.
[118:39.80]It's that one right there.
[118:42.90]Okay, I have this bowl.
[118:45.88]I have one, two, three.
[118:48.06]I got three clean bowls.
[118:49.88]Time on that, please?
[118:54.36]Is it time?
[119:02.07]No?
[119:02.19]What do you mean?
[119:03.15]Hold on.
[119:04.86]Are we ready to reveal it?
[119:09.24]It's six minutes.
[119:15.11]Back to mixing!
[119:27.73]This is going to be gross, and a lot of people are going to be grossed out by this.
[119:30.93]I guarantee you I have diarrhea in like three hours.
[119:33.61]I guarantee you.
[119:39.17]That's just 100%.
[119:44.51]Time on that oven?
[119:50.91]This thing freaks me out, man.
[119:52.03]This thing freaks me the fuck out.
[119:58.38]Is this glue?
[120:00.54]No, it's... It's too thin.
[120:09.89]No, maybe it's not.
[120:11.07]Maybe it's supposed to be like a nice little drizzle or something.
[120:19.05]Add more powder.
[120:24.80]Fine!
[120:25.64]I'll add a little bit more powder.
[120:27.12]Fine.
[120:35.00]That's enough.
[120:36.32]Put it down.
[120:37.74]Put it down.
[120:47.04]Actually, not a bad idea.
[120:48.02]It's starting to really thicken up a little bit here.
[120:56.65]You want to talk about peak inefficiency, by the way?
[121:00.55]An entire two
[121:04.25]full packets of chocolate powder just eighty percent of it gone and there's one little dollop in there just absolute inefficiency there's not you can't get more inefficient than what just happened although hold on a minute I did put a big spoonful of my mouth in the beginning so that was that was one cake I did one full cake in my mouth in the beginning
[121:33.66]And then I did at least two cakes full licking it off of my hands.
[121:38.25]Right?
[121:38.81]So it wasn't a total waste.
[121:39.75]Maybe half of it.
[121:40.93]50% in efficiency.
[121:42.83]So I got an F. Still an F. Alright, yeah.
[121:49.42]That's definitely what it's supposed to be like.
[121:55.34]Oh, yeah.
[121:56.36]Oh, yeah.
[121:59.46]Oh, yeah.
[122:01.01]There we go.
[122:02.89]Maybe even a little bit more.
[122:05.93]Take it out.
[122:06.45]Take it out.
[122:06.91]Take it out.
[122:07.33]Take it out.
[122:07.71]How long has it been?
[122:08.21]Has it been too long?
[122:10.57]All right.
[122:10.77]I'm going to get it.
[122:11.21]I'm going to get it out.
[122:11.97]How long has it been?
[122:13.56]Take it out.
[122:14.06]Take it out.
[122:14.58]Oh, shit.
[122:17.08]Hold on.
[122:17.36]I'm almost... I got to get a little thing because it's too hot for me.

[124:45.45]That's alright though.
[125:33.97]You know, when you take out your trash, you take your trash out of the trash can, the bag, and there's just like one item that's always just at the very bottom of the trash can.
[125:47.84]And you just look in, you know, you see it there all the time.
[125:50.01]You know it's in there, but you don't ever fucking grab it.
[125:51.77]You don't take it out.
[125:53.33]This is the item that's just at the bottom of the trash can.
[126:06.38]It's hard as a rock.
[126:08.06]You ready to hear this?
[126:10.45]It's going to be like hard candy.
[126:12.35]Why?
[126:12.73]What happened?
[126:14.15]I told you it was in there for too long.
[126:18.17]Mmm!
[126:19.17]A yummy whoopie pie!
[126:25.80]Holy shit, this is good.
[126:31.62]This is good.
[126:35.56]Way better than the pizza.
[126:37.52]Oh, dude, Dunkaroos!
[126:40.00]Dude, Dunkaroos, dude!
[126:44.22]Are you kidding me?
[126:49.68]It's Dunkaroos.
[126:50.42]It's exactly like Dunkaroos.
[126:51.78]I wish I made 100 of these.
[126:56.63]Fuck this.
[126:57.89]You get one of these?
[126:59.77]Don't do this.
[127:00.63]Make a bunch of this shit.
[127:01.65]Make the frosting.
[127:02.17]Don't even put the frosting on.
[127:02.95]Don't make the whoopie pie.
[127:03.62]Make Dunkaroos.
[127:04.34]Break them up into little crunchy pieces.
[127:12.90]Holy shit, that's perfect.
[127:15.10]I wish I had more than the joke from the Disney Donald Goofy and Mickey Mouse cartoon where they were sharing one single bean and slicing it off like bread.
[127:29.43]I don't know.
[127:29.87]Jack and the Beanstalk.
[127:31.11]What is it called?
[127:31.57]What was that?
[127:31.91]What was that?
[127:32.25]What was it called?
[127:36.33]Was it Jack and the Beanstalk?
[127:38.52]They were slicing one bean like a bread.
[127:44.08]It was bread.
[127:44.84]Wait, was it bread?
[127:46.66]Oh, no.
[127:46.92]Yeah, they were slicing bread like paper thin.
[127:49.74]What was the bean?
[127:50.58]No, they did it to a bean, too.
[127:55.33]Okay, let's make a pretzel.
[127:56.73]Mmm.
[127:56.89]Mmm.
[128:00.01]I think I'm... I got clean bowls here.
[128:02.87]Let's see what it takes.
[128:03.45]Let me make sure I get this ready to go.
[128:07.27]I enjoyed my... I enjoyed it.
[128:09.97]Mmm.
[128:10.28]Yeah.
[128:10.60]Delicious.
[128:11.46]Delicious free sample at the mall.
[128:19.30]Now let's... For what I had, though, that was really good.
[128:24.57]And you know what sucks so bad is that's so good, and the free sample of the ball is always so good, but then when you actually get the food, it's not so good.
[128:33.87]When you take that free sample that they, oh, here, free sample, and you're like, holy shit, this is the best thing I've ever had in my life.
[128:39.11]You get the actual entree that that is.
[128:41.51]It's like a 7 out of 10.
[128:43.69]I hate that shit.
[128:44.37]It's so annoying.
[128:46.31]I want to buy the tray.
[128:47.97]I want to go up to the people that have the trays of the samples and be like, can I order, can I just buy the tray?
[128:53.83]Now, from you, I'll pay twice for what the actual entree is for.
[129:02.35]That's a psychopath test.
[129:05.15]Alright, well then I'm a psycho.
[129:06.05]Whatever.
[129:06.35]This has got to go.
[129:15.12]I still got water here, which is good.
[129:17.22]Probably going to need it.
[129:21.26]I can clean that up.
[129:22.52]Let's do the pretzel.
[129:24.93]It's because the sample people don't know how to do it.
[129:27.15]What do you mean?
[129:29.81]Chug the frosting!
[129:33.11]No.
[129:33.45]No, I'll shit my pants.
[129:36.90]I really will.
[129:37.64]I feel like I'm about to take, like, medicine.
[130:08.74]Something about it.
[130:09.38]I can't.
[130:09.92]I can't do it.
[130:10.84]Something about it.
[130:15.08]I can't do that.
[130:15.62]Something about it.
[130:18.90]I can't do it.
[130:20.34]Nope.
[130:22.15]Something about how that is.
[130:22.95]I don't want it.
[130:26.49]You know, if you put that in a Dunkaroos container, I'll eat it.
[130:30.25]It's not in a Dunkaroos container.
[130:35.27]No.
[130:35.43]No.
[130:36.61]I keep trying I keep trying to just psych myself out and do it it's just sugar what's the problem it's fucking fine it's sugar no it's not yes it is shut the fuck up it's fine it's not fine it's gross alright actually it is kind of gross
[131:06.43]Without the dunkaroo aspect of it.
[131:09.61]Alright, let's go.
[131:11.55]Trash container right here.
[131:14.81]We'll move this out of the way for now.
[131:15.91]I'll have to clean this up later.
[131:16.91]Alright, it's time for pretzel.
[131:19.87]Hopefully pretzel's not that.
[131:22.15]Hopefully I don't need a bunch of bullshit for the pretzel.
[131:24.10]Turn the oven off.
[131:26.62]Okay, fine.
[131:30.64]I am going to try my hardest.
[131:32.20]We've been here for a couple hours.
[131:33.24]For two, three hours.
[131:34.71]I'm going to try as hard as I can to make this the way that it looks on the actual package.
[131:41.46]Like, I have to do one that is correct.
[131:44.36]I have to.
[131:46.28]If I'm going to prove anything here.
[131:48.90]I need to be ready.
[131:53.43]I want to brush my teeth so bad.
[131:58.22]Clean the tray.
[131:58.94]I will.
[131:59.32]Let me just see what the damage is here.
[132:00.90]This is an elaborate one.
[132:03.46]Holy shit.
[132:05.24]This is so... There's so many packets in here.
[132:10.38]Oh, boy.
[132:10.88]Okay, this is just salt.
[132:16.07]This is egg wash.
[132:19.07]Nacho cheese sauce?
[132:22.75]Pretzel mix.
[132:24.93]Two pretzel mixes.
[132:25.97]Is there three?
[132:26.49]Okay.
[132:27.55]Okay.
[132:31.21]Am I ready for this?
[132:34.21]Let me at least... Hold on.
[132:36.19]Let me at least get these other bowls.
[132:37.91]Because I'm going to need one, two, three, four.
[132:40.71]One, two, three.
[132:41.25]I'm going to need four bowls.
[132:42.11]Let me clean this one out.
[132:44.30]And let me wash this tray.
[132:48.98]My mother's probably freaking out right now.
[132:53.62]You know, you guys like a backseat game?
[132:55.86]Oh, Backseat Gamers on Twitch.
[132:58.20]My mother loves to bake.
[133:00.33]She's really into it.
[133:02.05]She is probably backseat gaming right now so hard.
[133:05.39]Like, I fell off the cliff like four times to my mother right now.
[133:10.59]Right now she's just like, what is he doing with his hands?
[133:13.12]No, what are you, dumb?
[133:14.42]Like, are you pretending to not know how to do this, Jeremy?
[133:17.34]And she's like, oh my, I just said that.
[133:23.23]All right.
[133:25.09]Do I need, what do I need?
[133:30.07]For pretzel nuggets?
[133:31.05]No, I'm doing the loop.
[133:35.39]Alright.
[133:39.69]I can do this one.
[133:41.63]Let me clean up the area.
[133:42.61]Let me clean this out.
[133:43.39]I'll be right back.
[133:45.47]I'm going to try as hard as I can for this.
[133:49.42]You think that me trying to beat Jevil for the first try?
[133:53.38]No, I'm going to get this first try.
[133:54.96]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[133:56.34]I'm going to be fucking silent try-harding the whole time.
[134:01.25]I'm going to be dead silent.
[134:03.53]Quiet.
[134:06.61]I said I'm going to be silent tryharding this because I want to make sure I get it the first try.
[134:11.31]All right, get this bowl.
[134:12.59]These are just going to have to be cleaned later because that shit ain't going to happen right now.
[134:19.22]All right.
[134:20.66]Take this.
[134:23.74]And take this.
[134:26.94]Where's my paper towels?
[134:32.11]Speed run?
[134:32.93]Speed run easy bake oven?
[134:34.21]That's not going to work.
[134:35.39]You're sweating.
[134:37.11]I know I'm sweating.
[134:39.81]Wouldn't you be in this scenario if you were me?
[134:45.44]Think about it.
[134:46.76]There's over 11,000 people here watching me not be able to do a children's baking toy.
[134:51.44]You don't think that you would be sweating just a little here?
[135:00.51]There is like a baseball stadium full of people watching me like burn cupcakes.
[135:11.32]That's good.
[135:12.70]I am going to take it into and just clear it out a little bit more and then we'll be ready to go.
[135:16.28]It won't take nearly as long as the last time because I fucked it all up.
[135:26.15]This is disgusting.
[135:34.11]Sugar.
[135:35.61]It's just sugar, Jeremy.
[135:36.95]Don't worry.
[135:37.45]It's not going to hurt you.
[135:41.99]Ego maniac.
[135:42.93]Okay.
[135:51.38]And then I will return in two minutes.
[135:55.92]I'll be back in one or two minutes to keep going.
[136:13.94]We eat this.
[136:14.80]We eat this shit.
[136:16.48]You understand?
[136:19.34]We eat this.
[136:20.34]We eat this.
[136:23.20]We shouldn't be eating this stuff.
[136:24.94]We shouldn't be eating this.
[136:27.49]Just get a juicer and juice kale, cucumbers, and pineapples and shit.
[136:31.47]Don't eat this stuff.
[136:32.97]I can't believe we eat this.
[136:34.27]Why do I eat this?
[136:39.67]Why do I smell it?
[136:41.29]Why does it smell?
[136:46.27]All right, be right back.
[139:14.30]Clean.
[140:09.36]I still taste the marinara sauce.
[140:16.94]Even after eating, like, two other things.
[140:19.90]I can still taste it.
[140:22.56]It's, like, embedded into my gums.
[140:27.36]Alright, here we go.
[140:28.17]Time to make the pretzel.
[140:29.01]I'm gonna make this one count.
[140:30.11]I'm not gonna fuck around here.
[140:32.41]Pretzel time.
[140:33.09]Let's go.
[140:34.07]I'm ready.
[140:35.17]I'm ready to give this a fucking 100%.
[140:38.14]Alright, let's get this thing cooking.
[140:42.00]Uh-huh.
[140:44.48]Now it's try-hard time.
[140:45.96]This is going to be the best... If this is not one of the best pretzels you've ever seen somebody make with an Easy Bake Oven, I will give...
[141:00.14]I don't know.
[141:02.69]50 subs?
[141:03.95]I'll give you 50 community subs.
[141:06.51]If this is not at least a 5 or a 6 out of 10.
[141:10.75]If this is not a 5 or a 6 out of 10, I will.
[141:13.17]Promise.
[141:13.45]Okay, here we go.
[141:16.40]That means I'm going to do this right.
[141:20.00]One egg wash mix.
[141:24.02]Let's go.
[141:25.30]Let's fucking go.
[141:25.94]You know what?
[141:28.71]Let's get some music for this one.
[142:58.98]It's too loud for me.
[144:30.68]That's bad.
[144:49.27]Next is...
[144:59.04]pretzel mix I looked over there on that screen and I thought that this bowl was a fire I looked at the preview and I thought that was a fire if this this is this one I don't like this one give me another one this one's fucked up
[145:34.64]Oh, contaminated.
[145:48.37]Hurry up.

[146:30.20]Two.
[146:32.05]Three.
[146:34.56]Four.
[147:00.05]They're so gross.
[147:09.26]No.
[147:14.96]To a ball.
[147:16.80]Okay, what kind of pretzel do you want to make?
[147:18.57]I don't know how to make a pretzel, actually.
[147:19.81]I don't know how to make a pretzel.
[148:14.65]Now what?
[148:20.09]Okay.
[148:22.29]Ball.
[148:23.57]And we got a... Okay.
[148:38.60]Let's go.
[148:39.70]It's gonna be good.
[148:49.43]I think I need more water.
[148:51.61]I don't know.
[148:58.42]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[149:24.82]Bingo.
[149:27.28]Use a bit more water.
[149:28.20]I'm only gonna use water just to get it a little wet so I can use my hands with it.
[149:32.54]Just like they do with the fucking restaurants.
[149:36.73]Here we go.
[149:49.99]Is it blood in this?
[149:53.42]Am I bleeding?
[149:54.91]Oh, shit.
[149:56.12]No, I'm not.
[149:56.60]All right.
[151:49.65]It's a fish?
[151:50.95]What are you talking about?
[151:51.59]I haven't even spoken.
[151:57.31]This is loud for me.
[151:58.45]This sucks!
[152:20.61]Get that fucking liquid in there.
[152:22.17]That's what the problem is.
[152:22.99]There's not enough fucking liquid in there.
[152:24.66]Get it in there.
[152:25.26]Work it in there.
[152:26.26]Go.
[152:42.31]What's a pretzel do?
[153:03.99]It's very finicky.
[153:06.13]Hold on.

[153:20.77]Fuck this one.

[153:25.07]This is the one we're using.
[153:38.10]Okay, here we go.
[153:40.34]How do you do it?
[154:07.33]Yeah, twist it, I can't!
[154:12.14]That just scared me.
[154:21.01]Okay, then it goes... Twist it like this?

[155:46.96]Ain't that a five?
[155:50.56]Alright.
[155:51.64]Now shut this up.
[155:52.94]I can't fucking hear.
[155:53.84]I just did like a monkey.
[155:59.06]Okay.

[156:04.99]Tempered by the fires of hell, his iron will remains
[156:27.88]This music doesn't... It's fucking freaking me out.

[156:49.13]Is it on?
[156:51.43]No, you don't salt.
[156:51.97]You salt after.
[156:52.55]Salt after.
[156:52.93]You don't salt yet.
[156:53.46]You salt after.
[156:56.23]Make the glaze, make the dough, glaze it, and then make the cheese.
[157:06.97]Salt it?
[157:08.19]Salt now.
[157:10.05]Salt it now?
[157:15.05]Should I actually salt it?
[157:16.01]The directions don't say anything about salt.
[157:22.97]I don't see anything about salt.
[157:26.33]Oh shit, yeah, it does.
[157:27.36]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[157:45.77]That's- that's fine.
[157:46.85]That's- no, no, no, that's good, that's good, that's good.
[157:48.45]That's not- that's perfect.
[157:50.27]Alright, get it in the oven.
[157:54.23]Here we go.
[158:02.58]It's too big.
[158:41.36]Come on, don't do this to me now.
[158:44.52]All right, get it in there.
[158:50.99]12 minutes.
[158:51.25]This shit's on, right?
[159:20.39]It's still playing over here.
[159:21.89]Do you see, do you hear how fucking loud that is?
[159:25.95]Listen to that.
[159:27.82]I couldn't turn it down in my head.
[159:31.30]Okay.
[159:31.66]Okay.
[159:43.31]Jesus.
[159:44.81]My goodness.
[159:49.08]It's from the mic, that's from the mic.
[159:55.46]Holy fuck dude, what?
[159:57.74]Put it back.
[160:00.20]Compact streamer goes deaf.
[160:15.81]I don't think I'm gonna be able to do these.
[160:23.96]This one looks complicated.
[160:30.44]The rest of these look real complicated.
[160:32.90]I'm willing to open them and see.
[160:34.60]We've already done this one.
[160:35.50]Fuck this thing.
[160:38.92]I'm giving this thing to my niece anyways.
[160:42.32]Oh wait, the cheese sauce!
[160:45.08]What about the cheese sauce, dude?
[160:51.90]Make the cheese dip.
[160:53.05]No.
[160:53.71]I don't want to make that.
[160:54.37]Do you know how bad this is going to smell?
[160:58.09]I refuse to make this.
[161:04.10]Just the smell alone from opening this would probably make me gag.
[161:10.52]Derm is the worst uncle.
[161:13.30]A free, easy-bake oven with some fucking cool toys and some awesome recipes?
[161:16.70]This makes me a bad uncle?
[161:20.31]What are you smokin'?

[162:02.98]We're going to be eating this shit in 10 years anyway.
[162:04.80]20 years from now, real food is going to be hard to come by.
[162:11.20]Like, powdered food is going to be actually what we're eating.
[162:14.50]That and bugs.
[162:16.74]50 years from now, we're going to be eating bugs and powdered milk.
[162:18.71]Okay, how many?
[162:21.35]Two teaspoons of water?
[162:28.25]That's true.
[162:28.75]Yeah, I know.
[162:30.77]I'm completely aware.
[162:36.86]Time?
[162:40.64]What we got for time?
[162:42.25]Must be 12 minutes.
[162:43.07]Everything.
[162:43.37]Why is everything 12 minutes?
[162:48.79]Two, right?
[162:49.77]That's it?
[162:50.37]Maybe one little bit?
[162:51.09]Yeah.
[162:55.37]Maybe if I didn't have such huge ass balls, this wouldn't be a problem.
[163:03.53]Because all I'm effectively doing is just getting it all over the place.
[163:08.41]This is supposed to be a cheese sauce.
[163:12.24]Why did I open the... Why did I open this package?
[163:15.08]Why did I open the package?
[163:22.30]Why did I open this package?
[163:29.29]It stinks.
[163:36.06]This is not even a sauce.
[163:37.14]This is more like a solid than it is a sauce.
[163:42.59]I just fucked it up.
[163:44.85]I just fucking ruined it.
[163:57.82]Would you eat this?
[164:00.18]Would you eat this?
[164:01.38]Would you eat it?
[164:16.76]I mean, it kind of is like a dip.
[164:18.72]It's supposed to be a cheese dip.
[164:22.42]I can't even fucking imagine.
[164:23.68]Am I going to, like, a Super Bowl party?
[164:27.26]Oh, what do you got there?
[164:28.54]Oh, well.
[164:30.67]We've got cheese dip.
[164:32.21]Yeah, we've got a little bit of gravy left from Thanksgiving last year.
[164:38.11]We've got sourdough dough and water.
[164:41.73]Like, this is not enough.
[164:50.19]What a feast!
[164:55.43]Okay, seriously.
[164:57.11]This is the type of shit, you get mad when your bowl looks like this when it's still, when it comes out of the dishwasher like that.
[165:02.62]It's like, fuck man, that's not clean.
[165:07.82]Bullshit.
[165:08.62]That's unbelievable.
[165:11.87]This is post-dishwasher angry.
[165:15.31]Not cheese dip.
[165:18.06]Speaking of post dishwasher angry, I'm gonna have a lot of fun cleaning this shit up.
[165:24.96]I don't wanna eat this.
[165:28.84]What's the time?
[165:33.38]Cheese dick?
[165:39.19]This is, oh.
[165:49.67]Can you imagine, like, being in line at lunch?
[165:53.39]It's like nachos is on the menu.
[165:54.99]Wow, nachos.
[165:55.91]We never have nachos.
[165:57.55]Little lunch lady's just like, yeah, we only got a little bit left.
[166:02.25]Okay, who's next for the cheese?
[166:04.50]That's when you just skip and you just go to the fucking meatball sub.
[166:27.54]add more water what would I need time on that you thought you thought I was gonna do it oh that I don't even know how it happened it's like I was holding a bug in my hand and I looked down and it was gone it just freaks me out cuz I didn't know where the bug was four minutes
[167:00.90]Cool.
[167:03.33]This is, no, this is probably, Lunchables Cheese, I think, is probably better than this.
[167:37.66]How has it become less is what I don't understand.
[167:41.41]How did it... It's disappearing.
[167:57.02]Should I go for it?
[167:58.06]No.
[168:02.60]No.
[168:04.79]earwax.
[168:05.69]Oh, now I can't do it.
[168:07.13]Alright, I'm taking it out.
[168:21.36]Why has every single one of these... Let me give you a rundown of what the last three hours has been.
[168:25.44]The last three hours has been I make this gross shit and then sit there
[168:31.60]over the course of three recipes and try to eat a huge amount of the gross thing.
[168:38.95]I've done it like four times.
[168:44.90]You gotta go all in.
[169:03.27]Still there.
[169:03.67]It's gone.
[169:14.72]That was the grossest thing I think I've done in probably the last five years.
[169:17.54]I'm not even kidding.
[169:18.14]That's probably the grossest thing I've done in the last three years.
[169:24.25]Does it taste like cheese?
[169:25.43]It tastes like...
[169:30.70]I feel like a cat just puked in my mouth and then somebody just sprayed like I can't believe it's not butter up my nose.
[169:38.37]That's kind of what it feels like.
[169:43.71]Is it ready?
[169:48.48]Is it ready?
[169:49.00]Is it time?
[169:53.08]One minute?
[170:00.70]Oh.
[170:03.74]Did I ever tell you guys a story of how I never in my whole life have ever puked from looking at food or smelling food?
[170:12.26]I really haven't.
[170:13.13]I haven't.
[170:14.39]But one time I did.
[170:16.65]One time there was in the, so my mother made eggs and bacon and like a breakfast spread, right?
[170:23.51]And after a few hours, you know, obviously it's like, okay, like let's clean it up, put everything in the sink.
[170:29.63]And okay, we've got like, there were dirty plates in there because we didn't have a dishwasher at the time, I don't think.
[170:37.23]And in the sink with all like the dirty kind of breakfast plates was this one dirty plate that had eggs on it still.
[170:46.21]just like curdled up scrambled eggs wet and cold and it smelled like gross eggs and I threw up like I threw up directly into the sink on top of the eggs it's the only time it's ever happened oh shit no I puked from Oreos but no I was sick though that's a lie it's not a lie I was sick though I was not sick for this story that's not a that's not a fake story that's a real story
[171:16.89]All right, here we go, you ready?
[171:18.39]I wish I had some cheese dip.
[171:39.77]Ah, shit.
[171:41.45]Ah, fuck!
[171:53.78]It's so bad.
[171:55.06]It smells... rotten.
[172:23.90]50 subs.
[172:24.76]But before, but I, that's not fair because I had to squish it because it couldn't fit in here.
[172:37.55]God damn it.
[172:40.59]All right, 50 subs, fine.
[172:43.47]All right, fine.
[172:44.57]50 subs, you get it.
[172:45.11]You're gonna have to wait till, you're gonna have to wait till I go, go home.
[172:52.66]So if you want the subs, you're going to have to wait until tomorrow.
[172:57.64]Because I can't, I'm not even, I can't do it right now.
[173:01.87]I need like PayPal, like credit card info, like hooked up here.
[173:06.61]You didn't get scammed.
[173:07.57]We're going to be here tomorrow too.
[173:11.01]Oh boy.
[173:11.49]Oh boy, I don't even want to take a bite of this.
[173:20.30]The cheese is kind of fucking me up.
[173:25.56]Oh, why did I eat that?
[173:28.00]I'm not... Like, I'm not on... Like a game show where I have to eat gross shit.
[173:35.54]Now somebody... Hey, somebody already did it!
[173:37.48]I don't have to do it anymore!
[173:41.48]Okay, that's not gonna... Wait, listen to my voice.
[173:43.10]Do you hear this?
[173:43.98]This is... I don't move.
[173:45.56]Nobody move.
[173:46.10]Nobody fucking move.
[173:46.78]This is exactly what I talked about in the past.
[173:49.08]Nobody fucking move.
[173:50.94]I need to keep this as long as possible because...
[173:54.29]Cheese it's gone.
[173:55.53]God damn it
[174:31.14]That's not edible.
[174:33.80]That's not edible.
[174:35.48]It wasn't edible.
[174:37.52]Coward.
[174:45.15]I just, okay, I can't eat out of the trash.
[174:47.19]I'm a grown man.
[174:48.99]No, nope, it smells so bad.
[174:57.40]Look at how much of a mess this is.
[174:58.86]Look at how much of a mess it is to have kids.
[175:01.15]Look at how much, look at how fucking hard kids are to have.
[175:09.93]I don't have any kids.
[175:14.05]Kids suck.
[175:19.03]All right.
[175:21.92]I threw the tray away.
[175:23.10]I'll get it.
[175:23.52]Don't worry.
[175:23.94]I'm not going to throw metal in the trash.
[175:26.44]What do you think, I'm dumb?
[175:28.28]Oh, you cycle that shit.
[175:45.65]I'll get it later.
[175:46.15]Alright, what else is here?
[175:54.28]I feel like I should give this to my niece, and she could actually have fun with it rather than me embarrass myself.
[176:00.59]Like, I mean, these would be fun for, like, my niece to do.
[176:05.17]Someone just called me a wanker.
[176:15.82]My bowls are all dirty.
[176:17.34]I don't know if I could even do another one.
[176:23.96]Your niece doesn't want this.
[176:26.24]Yes, she does.
[176:27.28]Who wouldn't want an Easy Bake Oven?
[176:35.73]Use the dirty bowls.
[176:44.45]This actually was fun, though.
[176:45.53]I had a lot of fun doing this.
[176:46.79]I don't think I can physically make another one.
[176:53.84]I was supposed to do, like, six.
[176:55.56]We did three.
[176:56.32]Let me see.
[177:01.02]Let me see.
[177:01.36]This one looks fun.
[177:02.06]Let me see how fun this one looks.
[177:11.19]I just, like, opened my niece's present.
[177:18.41]Devil's food cake?
[177:20.25]Oh, this is a lot.
[177:31.28]Put it back.
[177:32.02]Put it back.
[177:32.44]Put it back.
[177:32.80]Put it back.
[177:33.20]Put it back.
[177:34.18]Just hold on.
[177:37.42]Stop stealing it from your niece.
[177:47.63]Fine.
[177:50.40]Don't worry.
[177:51.38]I got to clean that.
[177:53.14]I got like gross cheese on it.
[178:02.81]break the oven stop saying stop saying the cock thing stop saying that you're gonna get in a lot of trouble with me personally I'm cleaning up I'm cleaning up this ain't gonna fucking happen you know it isn't play jump king
[178:35.00]That's not going to happen.
[178:42.04]Well, so here's what we're going to do.
[178:43.60]I'm going to clean up.
[178:44.52]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[178:46.65]I'll be back in the studio here for green screen DLC for free volume two tomorrow.
[178:51.81]I'm going to be in the same exact spot.
[178:55.29]Except, obviously, there won't be a beach behind me.
[179:00.36]It will be full screen and 60 FPS.
[179:03.17]And we'll do a shitload of stuff on the green screen.
[179:04.96]I have... I have... At least a few hundred things to do.
[179:12.72]I have... I have a shitload of costumes.
[179:16.52]We're doing a lot of movie and TV show shit tomorrow.
[179:19.67]It's... I went overboard, like I said in the beginning of the stream.
[179:24.71]Hopefully you get some good footage and make some fun shit.
[179:30.87]Green screen movie night.
[179:33.34]What time tomorrow?
[179:35.90]Probably around the same time.
[179:36.76]Probably around like 4 o'clock, 3.30 Pacific.
[179:43.11]Is there any Jojo?
[179:44.01]There are no Jojo's Bizarre Adventure moves.
[179:46.57]I can promise you that.
[179:52.13]I think I've hit my limit on Easy Bake Oven.
[179:54.43]That was fun.
[179:55.95]That was fun.
[179:58.11]This is just gross.
[180:03.15]It's just gross.
[180:06.68]Your kids will have a lot of fun with it.
[180:08.34]Your kids might like it.
[180:09.94]But then you have to clean up.
[180:11.96]Just make sure you have a fucking spit bag over here to like spit your food into.
[180:17.62]You know what sucks about this?
[180:20.06]I am going to think about... Why am I doing that a lot today?
[180:24.61]I am going... Put your hand up.
[180:27.21]I'm going to think about eating that ball of cheese.
[180:30.45]That's never going to leave my brain.
[180:31.39]I'm going to think about it like once or twice a week.
[180:34.39]I'm going to be in the shower just thinking about how it felt going down my throat.
[180:38.89]And I think I'm forever changed.
[180:41.05]I think I'm forever changed because of that.
[180:45.08]I'm thinking about it right now.
[180:51.68]Ah.
[180:58.07]Mom, I'm sorry if you're watching.
[181:00.05]I'm sorry that I don't have the capable skills to be a baker.
[181:04.35]Couldn't get through four Easy Bake Oven tutorials.
[181:08.41]This is cooking tutorial.
[181:10.28]And I failed it.
[181:12.28]Failed it, Mom.
[181:13.74]Failed the cooking tutorial.
[181:17.32]Pepe hands.
[181:19.18]All right, let me come over there.
[181:20.88]This is going to take a while for me to clean and get this place not like a shit show.
[181:37.22]I'm coming over there now.
[181:43.72]Hi.
[181:46.32]Alright.
[181:49.39]This is longer than I thought it was going to be.
[181:51.55]It's been three hours?
[181:54.73]I thought it was like two... No, it's been... Okay.
[181:57.15]It's been three hours.
[181:58.09]Damn.
[181:58.47]Alright.
[182:01.41]Three hours to do one... No, turn that off.
[182:08.28]Show you cleaning?
[182:12.97]Three hours and two minutes.
[182:17.41]The oven is still on.
[182:20.33]Okay, that would have been very bad.
[182:21.75]Do a cleaning stream?
[182:23.93]Uh... I should have kept that plugged in.
[182:34.72]But actually what I'm going to do...
[182:36.68]is once we get out of here, I'm going to get all my costumes ready.
[182:40.30]I'm going to get every object ready.
[182:42.86]I got a shitload of objects.
[182:44.66]I got a lot of toys and outfits and... Do a preview?
[182:52.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[182:54.39]Are you serious?
[182:59.27]Finish Saw?
[183:02.22]I'm in a studio right now.
[183:05.66]I'm not at my computer.
[183:08.64]We're going to finish Saw on Sunday.
[183:10.04]Until the day after tomorrow, we're going to finish Saw.
[183:16.74]Yeah, I'm at the goddamn beach.
[183:18.50]Don't you see?
[183:19.94]That went out of my room.
[183:25.72]Alright.
[183:27.16]I'm out of here.
[183:27.76]I'll see you guys later.
[183:29.54]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[183:31.48]Tomorrow's stream will be a lot longer than this because we have at least five plus hours of stuff to do.
[183:38.87]So I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[183:41.87]I can't even... That ball, I can't even fucking look at it.
[183:44.07]I don't know what to do with that ball.
[183:48.73]This one here.
[183:53.24]God damn it, it's horrible.
[183:55.28]Alright, I don't have an ending here because I'm...
[184:00.86]I can't, like, I can't, like... Hold on, let me see.
[184:03.26]Did we get any big bits to make sure I didn't miss anything?
[184:08.64]We did.
[184:08.96]We had a couple of huge bits.
[184:10.98]Hold on a second, let me see.
[184:13.09]I have no outro or anything.
[184:14.21]I got nothing here.
[184:20.47]Jesus Christ.
[184:21.27]Yeah, there was, like, a... Holy shit!
[184:30.08]Let me move over this way.
[184:32.10]Let me at least say thanks to the people that gave like fucking hundreds of dollars.
[184:40.71]Tay Rocker gave 50 bucks.
[184:42.31]Thank you, Tay Rocker.
[184:43.99]Remember last year I was struggling to keep it together.
[184:45.93]I was homeless.
[184:46.81]Holy shit.
[184:47.87]But still working late hours at a stressful job.
[184:49.79]But my hard work paid off.
[184:52.29]And now I share a home with the woman I love.
[184:54.26]That's fucking awesome.
[184:56.96]That's a really good turnaround.
[184:58.85]Your streams kept me sane on very cold nights, so I thought it was only fair to add to that towering pile of cash stuffed in your garage.
[185:05.85]Stay healthy.
[185:06.49]Don't let chat bully you, you beautiful, compact man.
[185:10.33]Hey, thanks.
[185:12.53]And thanks for the $50.
[185:13.01]I'm glad to hear about the turnaround.
[185:16.15]That's really good to hear.
[185:18.81]We had $55 fucking dollars from the chef's corner.
[185:24.37]Hey, looking forward to the rest of the stream.
[185:25.61]Thank you, German, for being the most creative e-clown.
[185:27.65]Thanks for the five years of laughs.

[185:30.31]And they said, and love you, chat.
[185:33.75]There you go.
[185:35.81]Thanks for the insane amount of money.
[185:38.89]Phylactery gave $150, which is insane.
[185:44.03]Here's $100, you fucking legend.
[185:45.91]Enjoy your cancer.
[185:49.25]No, I don't say that.

[186:52.22]I think I'm saying your name right.
[186:54.94]Thanks for 50 bucks.
[186:55.84]This is so much money tonight.
[186:59.26]German, I know you're a little busy eating your meal right now, but I found this to be the best time to mention my friend's German dream.
[187:03.83]Oh, nice.
[187:04.23]This is my favorite.
[187:05.94]In my Jerma dream, he was doing a vlog-esque livestream, and he was touring his new house, and his girlfriend kept making really funny jokes.
[187:14.08]And Jerma started getting jealous and got pissed, and turned around and said, if you don't shut the hell up, I'm gonna put you in my cringe compilation.
[187:20.27]Dead seriously, it's haunted me.
[187:23.73]What the fuck?
[187:29.39]Why?
[187:31.03]Why am I such a sick fuck in everybody's dreams?
[187:37.64]And then CallMeFalse gave $100 too.
[187:42.67]CallMe, thanks for the $100.
[187:43.79]This is the most beautifully cursed stream I've seen in forever.
[187:45.87]Thanks for the laughs, Germa Ramsey.
[187:50.03]I thought it was fun.
[187:52.27]Just wish I had more bowls.

[188:30.78]Five community subs.
[188:31.56]I don't know.
[188:31.84]Are they here?
[188:37.70]Maybe.
[188:40.34]Dude, okay, it's starting to... I smell that cheese.
[188:42.46]I got to get fucking rid of this now.
[188:45.62]Like, that cheese is a heavy cloud that's just filling the air.
[188:50.43]I got to get rid of this now.
[188:52.20]I can't believe I fucking ate that.
[188:53.64]I'm disgusted at myself.
[188:55.08]I'm disgusted, and I'm going to watch the clip.
[188:57.96]I'm going to check out some of the clips from the stream.
[188:59.33]People are going to send them to me, and I'm going to be fucking disgusted.
[189:01.77]By the way, there are over there some mats that I can probably fucking jump on and flip on and shit.
[189:12.94]Those are like stunt mats over there.
[189:14.80]I'm going to ask the studio if I can use those.
[189:18.03]Because if I can front flip over them and jump on them and shit, diving shots and diving catches and shit, I'm going to see if I can use those.
[189:30.44]Don't strain?
[189:31.04]Well, they're like big stunt pads.
[189:33.93]I'll be alright, don't worry.
[189:35.81]I've been preparing for this very moment.
[189:39.72]But I've got to get out of here.
[189:40.98]I've got to clean this up.
[189:42.32]This is going to just start stinking, and I don't want to have their studio.
[189:46.47]I don't want to fuck up their studio, so I've got to get out of here.
[189:48.99]Right at the very end, Fel6, thanks for five subs, and thanks for watching, by the way.
[189:51.79]I've got to get into frame.
[189:55.54]Thanks for watching the stream, everybody.
[189:57.20]We'll see you tomorrow for the green screen DLC for free, Volume 2.
[190:03.08]See you tomorrow.
[190:09.92]I'm going to get out of here.
[190:17.56]Wait, can you see under... Hold on, ready?
[190:27.12]That's not right.
[190:28.44]That's weird.
[190:29.58]I don't know what the fuck I'm seeing, but whatever.
[190:32.22]All right, good night.
[190:35.47]See you guys tomorrow.
[190:36.35]Same time, same place.
[190:39.45]Goodbye.
