[00:08.44]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.19]Jerma here with some Borderlands 2.
[00:12.35]This game just came out last night, in North America at least.
[00:16.41]We actually had a conversation with Boo about how he couldn't join our game because it's not out in Europe yet.
[00:22.56]But if you're watching this a few days from now, it is probably out in Europe and this is totally irrelevant, but...
[00:27.42]There's three of us on the screen here, me, Stealth, and Etalyx.
[00:30.15]Boo will be joining us shortly, like I said, in the next coming couple days.
[00:34.09]But I want to make this video, just want to introduce this for a second or two, because I do not think I'm going to be doing a full Let's Play of this game.
[00:42.17]What you can expect to see content-wise for Borderlands 2 is along the lines of this video.
[00:47.34]This video is going to be broken up into a bunch of just highlights.
[00:50.60]Maybe two or three minutes here, two or three minutes there.
[00:53.04]Just some funny things that happened or crazy boss fights or something like that.
[00:56.48]I'm just going to be constantly recording this game.
[00:58.73]So anything that I come across will be uploaded to this channel.
[01:02.53]So I'm not sure how many videos it's going to end up being in the end, but expect at least a few of them.
[01:08.93]So that's going to wrap it up.
[01:09.65]Just wanted to introduce this, guys, and enjoy the live commentary.
[01:12.65]And take care, everybody.
[01:15.33]Yeah, why don't you have a gun?
[01:16.78]And why do you guys have, like, no health?
[01:18.32]Wait, now you have health!
[01:20.57]I just reginned all of mine.
[01:21.73]I got all of mine back, because I'm a good siren.
[01:25.49]So Stealth, you're the only first.
[01:27.45]They really screwed you, Stealth.
[01:30.07]Yeah, I know.
[01:31.35]This guy, this Clamp Shat needs to give me my things.
[01:33.57]Oh, and you're not going to have any health and no weapons.
[01:37.19]That's great.
[01:40.18]Look, there's the Hyperion ship in the distance.
[01:44.54]Where is it?
[01:45.98]Over there.
[01:46.32]Ooh!
[01:51.43]Imagine if it just exploded.
[01:53.59]If it just exploded.
[01:55.34]That would be amazing.
[01:56.98]I love the reload animation for this sniper.
[01:59.70]Right?
[02:00.30]Oh, geez, yeah.
[02:01.60]It's like a revolver sniper.
[02:03.42]I still don't have a weapon.
[02:08.06]I found the collectible.
[02:09.24]I found money.
[02:10.86]We need to look around for money and stuff.
[02:13.30]That's one thing.
[02:16.02]Did Claptrap just die?
[02:19.22]Oh, no, that's a different one.
[02:20.58]Look at it.
[02:20.88]It's like there's like a dead claptrap corpse right here.
[02:23.80]I thought he like just passed out.
[02:25.76]All the claptraps are dead.
[02:28.22]I do much better with low sensitivity in these games than high.
[02:30.38]Use mouse one to fire.
[02:34.04]Use mouse two for melee or for... Can I say that I love the ice like part of this game?
[02:41.80]It's great.
[02:42.40]It looks really cool already.
[02:43.56]It looks great.
[02:46.31]Yeah, you can hold E to pick up, like, everything around you.
[02:49.07]Ooh, thanks for the tip.
[02:50.43]What did she just say?
[02:51.15]I'm assuming it's not important.
[02:53.23]Uh, retrieve Claptrap's eye.
[02:55.11]Is what we gotta do.
[02:57.57]Uh-oh, oh!
[02:59.43]Up top!
[03:04.32]This guy, I don't, this guy's terrible.
[03:06.68]This pistol's the worst gun in the game.
[03:08.26]Uh, I didn't hit one person, by the way.
[03:13.26]Yeah, good job, guys.
[03:16.58]Yeah, I didn't hit one bullet on anyone.
[03:19.28]Good job, guys.
[03:20.26]I think it's blood.
[03:22.52]Alright, hold on.
[03:23.50]Damage 41.
[03:26.16]What is this personal item?
[03:27.43]Hey, there's monsters, by the way.
[03:29.25]Oh, there's monsters?
[03:30.79]Oh!
[03:32.51]Oh!
[03:33.13]Oh, hey!
[03:33.41]Hey, everybody.
[03:34.79]Oh, critical hit, baby.
[03:36.69]Critical hit, baby.
[03:38.21]Oh, there's a pistol.
[03:42.57]Why do you guys get real weapons?
[03:44.45]The big one.
[03:45.35]That's the big one.
[03:49.15]Is there bullet travel time in this game?
[03:54.77]I don't remember there being travel time with bullets in the other one.
[03:58.23]Maybe I'm just crazy.
[03:59.25]Claptrack, come on.
[04:00.15]Get out of there.
[04:01.77]Get down there.
[04:04.37]Get down there.
[04:06.33]Oh, handsome Jack.
[04:09.02]This Claptrack has no idea what's going on.
[04:10.84]Run!
[04:11.32]Handsome Jack.
[04:18.42]I don't know.
[04:18.72]I don't think Handsome Jack's that handsome.
[04:20.22]Ooh, health stuff.
[04:25.10]I would say something, but I'm not going to.
[04:27.66]How do you use the health injector again?
[04:29.43]That's another person who thinks they're so handsome.
[04:34.15]Hey, I didn't... All I said was that Handsome Jack is not as... Oh, God!
[04:43.61]What's with the pendant on his neck?
[04:45.63]I can't read that.
[04:46.41]Holy cow.
[04:46.91]Knuckle... What did that even say?
[04:49.33]I think that was knuckle-dragger.
[04:53.65]Let's get the knuckle-dragger.
[04:54.94]Oh, hi!
[04:58.84]Shoot him in the face.
[05:00.38]Why is he chasing me?
[05:01.90]I'm fine with that.
[05:02.68]Yeah, go after Etalyx.
[05:05.96]Only go after Etalyx.
[05:07.36]He's looking at me funny.
[05:08.58]Look, he's like walking towards you while looking at me.
[05:12.90]This gun is so inaccurate, there's so much recoil on this thing, it's like un-aimable.
[05:18.58]Sniper, nice crit right there.
[05:20.10]They're coming out of the walls.
[05:22.00]Does everyone else have a sniper?
[05:23.74]No, I have a pistol!
[05:25.71]Get punched in the face!
[05:29.25]Ow.
[05:30.55]Oh my god, I'm stuck here!
[05:33.55]Melee!
[05:34.25]Wait, gimme, gimme all this stuff.
[05:37.18]Why are they all chasing me?
[05:38.42]Dude, this sniper rifle's way better.
[05:42.00]Oh, he's back down on the ground.
[05:42.96]He's throwing snowballs at MLC still.
[05:45.03]He's done.
[05:46.07]Say goodnight, baby.
[05:47.59]Give me all the tops.
[05:48.55]Give me everything.
[05:49.31]Just hold on every button.
[05:51.47]Oh, wow.
[05:52.03]Oh, I just got a pistol.
[05:54.11]I didn't pick up one single thing.
[05:56.76]I picked up, like, one thing of money.
[05:59.08]Alright, well, what happened to my sniper rifle?
[06:03.70]My sniper rifle just disappeared.
[06:06.93]Oh, no, it's still here.
[06:07.71]Hold on.
[06:08.51]Does anyone have anything that they want to give poor MLC still?
[06:12.21]Hey, can I just throw this on the ground?
[06:15.73]How do I throw this sniper rifle on the ground?
[06:17.30]I don't want this.
[06:18.16]I want you to have it.
[06:20.34]I don't want it.
[06:21.34]Well, you're the sneaky guy, right?
[06:23.06]That's what you're supposed to have, isn't it?
[06:24.64]It's all this stuff.
[06:26.70]Make sure you open up every single compartment.
[06:28.60]That's how we get money.
[06:31.31]Uh-oh.
[06:31.95]We're on chapter two, apparently.
[06:33.05]Oh, fuck.
[06:36.58]Don't really know what that means, but okay.
[06:38.51]I think we have to touch this button.
[06:40.37]What's going on?
[06:40.77]Touch the button.
[06:41.67]Travel canceled.
[06:42.41]Etalyx is in a menu.
[06:44.15]Ah, come on!
[06:45.31]Oh no!
[06:46.37]Get out of the menu!
[06:49.05]Sirman, you're so short!
[06:51.45]I told you to get out of the menu!
[06:55.21]There's a lot of stuff down here, so be careful.
[06:58.19]Uh-oh.
[06:59.43]Oh, hey.
[07:00.08]We don't take fall damage.
[07:05.71]Uh-oh.
[07:06.55]Did you hear that?
[07:07.38]There's something shiny down here.
[07:09.32]I must find it.
[07:10.64]This thing does some mad damage.
[07:12.02]It's shiny.
[07:15.60]Oh, it's funny.
[07:16.44]It's tough.
[07:17.62]In a shot, baby.
[07:20.04]Unlocks the skin for the Catch a Riot system.
[07:23.04]Attack, are you playing?
[07:25.37]Hey, why is it like a Warcraft character in the top right right now?
[07:31.47]I told you.
[07:31.97]I found something shiny.
[07:34.07]Who invited the Diablo 3 character?
[07:38.79]Calyx is stealing shiny things.
[07:40.64]I saw a shiny thing and I went to go pick it up.
[07:43.90]We're gonna defend him.
[07:45.08]We're gonna defend Claptrap.
[07:48.74]World of Warcraft character?
[07:49.68]Yeah, that was like a... That was like Tier 1 Warlock set that that guy had on.
[07:55.02]They're on the other side.
[07:55.88]How do we get over there?
[07:56.88]Jump over.
[07:57.68]On the left.
[08:00.08]Boom!
[08:02.08]Oh, bogey on your left.
[08:04.46]Got him.
[08:06.24]Got him.
[08:11.50]I take my Berserker tips from Burger Boy.
[08:13.66]Run straight at him!
[08:21.26]Get shot in the face.
[08:24.13]Oh, they're here.
[08:26.43]Watch out, there's a dog somewhere on the map.
[08:30.45]Oh, the people?
[08:31.71]The train station?
[08:32.71]Is that your house?
[08:34.27]How did I mess with that?
[08:36.93]That shot right in his face.
[08:37.99]Alex, it's an awkward time to BRB.
[08:41.69]Oh wait, he went BRB?
[08:43.59]Oh my god, no!
[08:49.75]Did we do it?
[08:50.55]There's one more guy over there.
[08:53.29]Yeah.
[08:54.25]We did it.
[08:54.67]We're good.
[08:55.09]I did it.
[08:56.13]I did it.
[08:57.03]I did it.
[08:58.19]You... Come on.
[08:59.07]We all did it, man.
[09:02.17]Yeah, everyone except for you.
[09:03.93]Which is only me.
