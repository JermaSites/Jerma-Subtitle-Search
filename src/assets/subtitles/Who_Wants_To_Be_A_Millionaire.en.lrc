[00:28.52]How is it going?
[00:29.34]What's up?
[00:34.62]How you doing?
[00:39.90]I got the urge to play who wants to be a millionaire.
[00:43.30]I want to play it.
[00:43.90]I know that there was some thoughts of what would happen today, what would happen in the next few streams.
[00:50.48]But I was like, you know what?
[00:52.40]I want to play that.
[00:52.96]Sounds fun.
[00:58.56]Sounds like a good time.
[01:06.71]Why are you at the Red Bull thing?
[01:08.21]Oh, I've seen the clip a few times.
[01:10.95]Also, Off-Brand was on that show.
[01:14.69]So I was like, you know what?
[01:16.31]Maybe I'll pop in.
[01:18.19]Say hello.
[01:20.24]So Off-Brand was doing some work on that show.
[01:23.74]I was able to kind of peek in.
[01:25.48]Say hello.
[01:30.01]Are you the sus guy?
[01:30.81]Ban that person for like a week.
[01:34.19]At least, I mean at least a week.
[01:39.18]Hey, good morning kid.
[01:41.50]Hey, good morning.
[01:43.36]Good morning wherever you are.
[01:47.94]Get a load of this guy.
[01:49.00]Yeah, what's up?
[01:53.88]It's great to see Ster and Ashley.
[01:58.46]It's actually been a long time since we've been able just to kind of hang out somewhere.
[02:03.34]So, that was really wonderful.
[02:04.68]Really great to see them.
[02:09.65]It's been a while.
[02:10.23]It was really great, though.
[02:14.45]I gotta go pee?
[02:15.25]Well, you have a few minutes.
[02:16.55]Go ahead.
[02:17.27]Hurry up.
[02:18.13]Well, no.
[02:18.57]Take your time.
[02:18.93]Do whatever you need to do.
[02:25.97]I know you already played Monkey Island, but you should play it on stream.
[02:33.18]Would you guys like a Monkey Island stream?
[02:35.26]Didn't they do a new... Isn't there like a new game?
[02:40.58]They made a new game.
[02:42.08]I feel like I played it for a little bit.
[02:47.22]Just jumping around on Game Pass or something, right?
[02:51.09]Of course it was on Game Pass.
[03:00.22]Have you seen Barbie yet?
[03:01.44]No.
[03:03.22]No, I haven't.
[03:05.62]I've been pretty busy.
[03:06.52]I haven't really had much time to go see a movie or anything.
[03:14.66]Did you play Pikmin 4?
[03:15.60]Did I even play Pikmin 3?
[03:18.52]I don't remember.
[03:20.60]What about Mission Impossible?
[03:23.90]What about TMNT?
[03:25.20]What about Oppenheimer?
[03:27.38]Yeah, there's a lot of movies that I just haven't watched.
[03:37.67]What happened to Toontown?
[03:41.22]Heard on StirStream that you got sick.
[03:44.72]Yeah.
[03:46.28]So let me give you just a brief synopsis of that.
[03:51.06]So Ster and Ashley were here and it was a, it was a great time.
[03:54.74]It was a wonderful time.
[03:56.30]I want to say the second day they were here, I got food poisoning.
[04:02.08]And it was just me.
[04:03.16]I was the only one.
[04:03.82]It was bad.
[04:05.96]And I thought the whole trip was going to get ruined.
[04:09.25]I was like, oh no.
[04:12.21]Here I am up here going through it so bad.
[04:16.68]I cannot wait to- well, not I cannot wait, but I know I'm gonna go talk to Ster and it's gonna be, oh, yeah, dude, I got it too.
[04:24.99]Or like, Holly, I got it too.
[04:27.39]Or Ashley, I got it too.
[04:29.31]No, I was the only one.
[04:30.37]It was just me.
[04:31.68]I must have been the sorry asshole that touched the thing or ate the thing, whatever it was.
[04:37.82]And it fucked me up big time for like 12 hours.
[04:41.00]After 12 hours, I was immediately cured.
[04:44.37]So that's how I know it was a temporary food poisoning thing.
[04:49.43]That sucked, but I'm really, really glad that it was just a quick, really, really fast turnaround.
[05:02.02]You never did your Smurfs homework.
[05:07.57]No, I don't.
[05:08.39]And I'm not going to.
[05:09.85]Give me an F in that class.
[05:17.00]Everything going through my mind during that was, oh... God, I'm gonna... I don't want to ruin this whole trip.
[05:22.84]I have to be better.
[05:23.50]I have to get better.
[05:26.02]And I was fine.
[05:26.74]So, thankfully.
[05:30.09]Happy to report that I am completely fine.
[05:32.05]And I was completely fine after, like, a day.
[05:35.51]Uh, Super F. Where?
[05:38.73]Not from my end.
[05:40.21]I don't see anything here.
[05:45.07]Yeah, I can confirm your tuna sandwich is great.
[05:47.11]I added eggs to it, so I hope that's okay.
[05:50.31]You can spin it however you want.
[05:53.51]Oh, F on homework.
[05:55.75]Oh, oh.
[05:56.23]Anytime I say F, I freak out.
[05:58.70]That letter has turned into just... It's like, if I see the letter F, it's panic mode.
[06:05.97]Something's wrong with my stream.
[06:07.11]If I see the capital letter F, there is something wrong that I need to go look at my stream setup right now.
[06:18.83]I'll give you a Grotto Beasts update.
[06:21.71]The Grotto Beasts tabletop mod digital version.
[06:27.13]Is very, very, very close.
[06:30.13]Keep your eyes peeled over the next week or so.
[06:32.19]Keep your eyes peeled.
[06:33.79]Keep an ear to the ground over the next seven days or so.
[06:39.41]It looks great.
[06:41.19]Team is doing an amazing job.
[06:43.35]Had the opportunity to see how it's going for a while.
[06:47.03]And I like what I see.
[06:49.43]Really cool.
[06:52.17]Should be a really fun place to hang out for those of you that just want to play it.
[06:56.23]Rather than having to do it in person or somehow figure out a way to play with somebody that you don't really know.
[07:02.11]I don't like the way that my skin feels.
[07:13.33]Um, I don't know how to answer that question, but good luck.
[07:20.78]Do we get a free copy of the digital version if we bought the starter pack?
[07:24.84]It is the digital version.
[07:26.84]The tabletop simulator version is just free.
[07:30.60]It's just completely free.
[07:32.38]No one has to pay anything.
[07:34.04]It's just a mod.
[07:35.28]Well, you have to own tabletop simulator.
[07:38.80]It's just going to be a mod.
[07:40.88]We fought with for a long time how to do that.
[07:44.16]But it's like, how do we charge for that?
[07:47.09]I don't think I want to charge for that.
[07:50.51]Grotto Beasts was such a success.
[07:52.73]I don't think it's appropriate to charge for that either, if I'm honest.
[07:58.46]So.
[08:01.28]Just a fun place for you to play it digitally.
[08:09.84]I have tabletop sim with with the Pepe hands up.
[08:13.78]Oh, nice.
[08:15.64]You're a terrible businessman.
[08:17.46]Yeah, whatever.
[08:20.89]You built like a shampoo bottle.
[08:22.47]Fucking pretty sick.
[08:27.07]Can I take a loan out here?
[08:28.19]No.
[08:28.37]How come you have a mullet?
[08:31.75]This is fun.
[08:41.46]Don't you have to pay people?
[08:42.88]Well, yeah.
[08:50.44]Don't worry.
[08:50.74]It's all good.
[08:51.16]It's all good.
[08:51.64]Don't worry.
[08:55.22]Don't worry.
[08:57.04]I assure you, it's going to be fine.
[09:02.94]Why do you hate Steve Jackson's sorcery?
[09:06.06]Um, I, hey.
[09:07.00]It's funny you say that.
[09:10.44]We're going back to sorcery.
[09:13.14]On the next stream.
[09:19.34]There you go.
[09:21.07]There you go.
[09:21.77]The next time this stream is live after today, it's going to be Sorcery Part 4.
[09:25.53]How do you feel about that?
[09:27.83]And then, get the trumpet ready.
[09:34.30]This coming weekend, not this weekend, but next weekend.
[09:36.90]So, we're talking Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 18, 19, 20.
[09:39.62]I'm trying to get the MVM group off the ground.
[09:46.02]So, tentatively trying to maybe figure out maybe next weekend.
[09:50.53]be like Saturday or Sunday, maybe Friday.
[09:52.77]We're kind of trying to see if I can get the group that I wanted to have play play.
[09:57.02]That should be fun.
[10:00.48]Looking forward to that.
[10:05.19]What about Baldur's Gate 3?
[10:07.29]I don't know if I want to stream Baldur's Gate 3 because I feel like I would make a character, get into the actual game, throw a rock at somebody, get like arrested in the game, poop my pants or something, and then be like, I'm kind of done.
[10:24.77]Because like the actual video game Baldur's Gate, I have no idea even how it plays.
[10:29.99]I know it's like third person, but it's top down, but I don't know anything about it.
[10:35.27]That sounds like a great stream.
[10:40.00]Maybe.
[10:42.60]It's D&D.
[10:49.29]It's basically just D&D on computer.
[10:53.13]I mean, it looks fun.
[10:54.45]It looks really fleshed out.
[10:57.01]Everyone's talking about it.
[10:58.69]I'm getting the FOMO.
[11:00.28]I'm getting Baldur's Gate 3 FOMO.
[11:01.86]I'm seeing, holy shit, this is the greatest single experience I've ever experienced in my entire life.
[11:08.24]It's like, holy shit.
[11:09.08]Okay, I should probably get it.
[11:09.83]Should I get it?
[11:11.71]And then you see the characters people are making.
[11:14.69]It's like, whoa, okay.
[11:16.87]Alright, you can make characters and stuff?
[11:18.35]That sounds fun.
[11:21.55]So I'm getting Baldur's Gate FOMO.
[11:24.13]See if it turns into anything.
[11:25.87]It's kind of that good, dude.
[11:27.11]It's sort of that good, really.
[11:28.37]Alright, well.
[11:31.65]Alright, let's get started.
[11:32.79]I want to just kind of hang up.
[11:33.67]I had a pretty busy week.
[11:35.33]Obviously, if you didn't know, Ster and Ashley were here.
[11:38.19]I had a wonderful time.
[11:40.67]Besides shitting my brains out for 12 hours.
[11:43.07]But hey, hey, sometimes stuff just happens.
[11:47.60]Life is gonna throw shit at you.
[11:49.62]And you gotta be ready to... You gotta be ready to adapt.
[11:51.60]You know what I'm saying?
[11:56.73]What do you mean, huh?
[11:58.15]Your milk voice hurts my eyes.
[11:59.45]Oh, you're listening to it.
[12:01.37]You're not looking at it.
[12:04.87]You didn't say... Did you say that you were shitting for 12 hours?
[12:08.22]No, but I did now.
[12:09.68]Now you know.
[12:18.28]I like this creamy voice.
[12:19.84]I like this creamy voice.
[12:26.61]You ever played Manhunt?
[12:27.67]I feel like a while ago.
[12:34.68]Hey, I still haven't done my Smurfs homework.
[12:38.30]You know what's funny about the Smurfs homework?
[12:40.50]I assigned it.
[12:42.02]And I didn't even do it.
[12:43.10]I assigned the homework.
[12:45.02]I wonder how many of you watched the Smurfs movie, took a bunch of notes, and were ready for class, and the teacher just didn't even bring the textbook in.
[12:54.20]Yeah, you kids go ahead and go.
[13:01.02]Go do this math assignment and bring it in when you're done.
[13:05.17]Okay, I did the math assignment.
[13:06.35]It's three days later.
[13:07.29]It's a week later.
[13:07.95]Yeah, we're not doing that shit anymore.
[13:09.93]We're moving on to it.
[13:10.67]We're talking about rocks today.
[13:13.71]And where they come from.
[13:14.53]You know, it's lava.
[13:16.32]It's lava.
[13:17.20]Did you know that?
[13:18.96]I did.
[13:19.86]I did.
[13:20.20]I'm the teacher.
[13:20.90]I know more than kids.
[13:26.88]Yeah, lava rocks.
[13:27.62]Isn't that cool?
[13:30.91]Alright, let's play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
[13:32.29]It's going to hang out.

[14:34.20]The Silver Porch Bridge.

[15:03.20]It is D.

[15:44.24]I don't think it's blue.
[15:47.70]I think this is it.
[15:51.86]I actually was going to pick that one.
[15:53.00]I even told you it's not one of these two.
[15:54.62]I told you.
[15:58.32]I wasn't cheating.
[15:58.88]I actually was going to pick that one.
[16:00.68]Complete the name at the end of this saying, meaning it'll be done immediately before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson, Jack Robinson, James Donaldson.
[16:15.86]It'll be done before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson.
[16:20.71]I have no idea.
[16:21.37]I actually have absolutely no idea.
[16:25.82]Who says this before you can say James Donaldson?
[16:30.38]Alright, I have to do this.
[16:31.28]Jack Robinson.
[16:35.02]How would this many people know that?
[16:36.99]It'll be done before you can say Jack Robinson.
[16:50.17]What?
[16:50.87]I guess it's correct.
[16:52.87]Is it British?
[16:54.03]Okay.
[16:56.35]The offense of willfully telling an untruth in a court after having taken an oath is known as treason.
[17:06.24]Perjury.
[17:06.70]Arson.
[17:07.98]Oh yeah, arson.
[17:10.36]That's perjury.
[17:10.94]Nice.
[17:11.04]$1,000.
[17:11.56]We're good.
[17:22.13]What is the common name for the decompression sickness that is a threat to divers?

[17:38.33]Yep.
[17:40.39]No help.
[17:40.93]No, that wasn't help.
[17:42.01]It's not the curves.
[17:47.11]Llama is a title for a spiritual leader in which religion?
[17:53.53]Llama?
[17:53.93]Llama?
[17:59.77]I don't think it's A. Uh, give me a new question.
[18:14.40]I don't know.
[18:14.76]The town of Telford is named after Thomas Telford, who was famous in which field?
[18:22.66]This is even harder.
[18:24.38]It's probably finance.
[18:31.01]I feel like it's finance because you have a bunch of money.
[18:34.79]And... I'm naming this town after me.
[18:38.28]Because I have a shitload of money.
[18:39.36]Does that make sense?
[18:41.36]How long ago is this?
[18:49.13]I can't reliably say.
[18:51.09]Let's call somebody.
[18:52.41]It's only the $2,000 question.
[18:54.26]This is a disaster.
[18:55.22]Alright, who am I going to call?
[18:59.18]I'm going to call son, wife, sister, granddaughter.
[19:05.62]Wait, this is my granddaughter?
[19:07.44]Alright, I'll call Zelda.
[19:17.96]My wife.
[19:19.73]Yes, hello.
[19:21.19]I'm listening.
[19:22.25]Good evening.
[19:23.37]This is Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
[19:25.83]And Pablo needs your wisdom.
[19:27.91]Well, I'm going to do my best then.
[19:30.66]Zelda, you're my last hope on this one.
[19:34.22]But don't put too much pressure on yourself, okay?
[19:37.58]Not too much.
[19:38.48]It's C. No doubts whatsoever.
[19:42.80]No doubt.
[19:43.62]Okay.
[19:46.36]I'm going to go with C. Engineering.
[19:50.42]Damn.
[19:50.60]Got it.
[19:51.30]4,000.
[19:52.28]The furthest I've ever been.
[19:53.96]Okay, by what name is the writer Charles Lutwidge Dogdson better known?
[19:58.85]Charles Lutwidge... Lutwidge Dogdson.
[20:22.65]Charles Lutwidge Dogson.
[20:26.51]I don't know who any of these people are.
[20:27.73]Okay, I'm going to see.
[20:34.29]Oh, shit.
[20:35.93]Well, I'm dead.
[20:36.41]That's not something you should say.
[20:50.21]Alright, well, whatever.
[20:50.85]That was a warm-up.
[20:51.33]That was a warm-up.
[20:51.91]It's fine.
[20:52.68]By the way, this doesn't really matter.
[20:54.02]I have so... I don't even know how I got so many of these.
[21:06.00]How do I have a million points?
[21:09.36]Did I cheat?
[21:12.42]Wait, how did this happen?
[21:14.02]How did I get a million points?
[21:16.82]I don't understand how this happened.
[21:18.18]I really don't understand it.
[21:20.78]I opened this and had the same reaction.
[21:22.24]I was like, what?
[21:25.49]Only do food?
[21:26.51]Million neurons.
[21:34.95]Okay.
[21:36.15]There's some of these I just don't know if I really want it.
[21:38.83]I don't have like really good answers to.
[21:42.47]Should we only do superheroes?
[21:44.75]Should we only do Star Wars and Disney?
[21:49.16]I guess this one makes sense.
[21:51.49]Should I just do them all?
[21:53.65]Who cares?
[21:54.17]Superheroes in Star Wars only.
[22:00.58]Whatever.
[22:02.00]You don't know much.
[22:03.48]Yeah, I mean, that doesn't really matter, does it?
[22:13.54]How did you not know the answer to Llama?
[22:14.92]I don't know.
[22:17.61]Alright, here we go.
[22:18.07]Here we go.
[22:18.29]I'm ready.
[22:18.60]I'm ready.

[31:45.63]I don't know what a quaver is, and I don't know what a crotchet is.
[31:48.85]So, both of those, you're just speaking like old English to me.

[33:04.51]In the 1963 film of the same name, what was the Pink Panther?
[33:11.29]Uh, this is a detective.
[33:12.63]But it's not detective.
[33:15.67]It's thief.
[33:17.09]Because the detective... Is the detective the Pink Panther?
[33:20.21]Or is the detective going after the Pink Panther?
[33:24.76]I think that's accurate.
[33:28.46]The Pink Panther is a thief.
[33:34.21]I could be way overthinking this.
[33:36.95]But I think the thief is the Pink Panther.
[33:40.77]The detective is the one going after the Pink Panther.
[33:46.92]What?
[33:47.52]It was Jewel?
[34:05.54]Alright, we're gonna take everything off besides superheroes.

[34:47.67]We'll go DC, fine.
[34:51.61]Star Wars, food, superheroes in DC.
[34:54.78]See if I can do it.

[49:30.04]I forgot.
[49:30.64]That's true.
[49:35.04]Andromeda is a constellation.

[51:39.48]I'm going to say show jumping.
[51:41.08]Is that what it is?
[51:44.26]Yeah.
[51:46.10]These are weird first questions.

[82:42.12]Nightblindness?
[82:42.90]Maybe?
[82:51.70]don't know what it is I would I would take the plunge and say that it's either double vision or night blindness and I have to use this because it's unfortunate oh that's great literally the two that I you didn't help me at all you did not help me at all so well actually that kind of does help because I feel like it's night blindness

[83:21.10]And I have to live with it, so.
[83:24.26]Oh, goddammit.
[83:26.48]I was right.
[83:26.90]This, this, this.

[83:29.20]Just ask me.
[83:31.43]Just ask me.
[83:31.97]Because, like, I was sitting there going, double vision, it's double vision.
[83:34.23]You know, I think it's double vision.
[83:35.67]Diplopia is double vision.
[83:37.15]But what if it's night blindness?
[83:38.47]I don't know.
[83:38.91]That's on here.

[91:28.28]Like a year ago.
[91:29.70]And I got it wrong then, and I'm going to get it wrong now.
[91:32.82]I remember this question.
[91:35.83]And I got it wrong then.
[91:36.91]I'm going to get it wrong now.

[92:46.21]And you'll get wrong.

[93:49.98]I'm not going to get this right.
[93:51.06]Why would I even have it on?
[93:55.97]Alright, let's go.
[94:07.20]You should swap off of Pablo.
[94:15.38]Uh, which animal's name also refers to a person using an experiment to see if it works or not?
[94:20.12]Can you pick?
[94:23.34]I'm choosing D. This new question.
[94:29.18]Also, another thing that's important to know, during trivia nights, I'm the guy that doesn't really... I don't work well under trivia pressure.
[94:38.48]So, if I'm on a team with another two or three people, I wait for somebody to start to say the letter, and then I cut them off and say the letter very quickly at the same time that they do.
[94:50.89]So, like, Wolverine does not have which one of these powers.
[94:54.78]And then, okay, let me see.
[94:58.06]Oh, this, no, he doesn't have, and I hear, oh, C, yeah, laser eyes.
[95:03.61]Of course he doesn't have laser eyes.
[95:08.45]And then we high five.
[95:11.75]Everybody thinks I know what I'm talking about.
[95:13.64]That's the one.
[95:21.54]I've never been to a trivia night in my entire life.
[95:24.12]So for all of you that are like, oh my God, what's wrong with him?
[95:28.44]I made it up.
[95:31.17]Made it up.
[95:32.31]Wasn't real.
[95:33.69]We got you on that one.
[95:35.21]We made it up.
[95:36.57]We made that one up.
[95:38.03]That one wasn't real.
[95:39.31]Huh, got you there.
[95:41.13]Just made up.
[95:44.22]What did Jack sell for a handful of beans in the fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk?

[96:01.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:03.51]No, no, no.
[96:03.89]Wait, hold on a second.
[96:05.87]Wait a second.
[96:07.29]Hold on.
[96:08.08]This is why I can't have more than one answer.
[96:12.74]Timon and Pumbaa.
[96:14.54]Pumbaa's the... Pumbaa's the fucking pig.
[96:18.74]It's a meerkat?
[96:22.21]When I was a young warthog!
[96:28.63]How does Romeo meet his death in Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet?
[96:37.41]Poison.
[96:45.23]How many equinoxes are there in a calendar year?
[96:49.53]Well, I mean, it depends.
[96:50.75]It depends on who's asking.
[96:51.95]It depends on what kind of... Is it an equinox?
[96:53.80]Is it a fall equinox?
[96:55.42]Is it the winter equinox?
[96:56.78]Is it the spring equinox?
[96:58.26]Is it the summer equinox?
[97:00.42]Because, I mean, that would be... I just named four.
[97:04.29]But, very importantly, there's only two.
[97:06.77]There are only two equinoxes.
[97:08.75]There's the winter equinox.
[97:10.29]There's the fall equinox.
[97:11.83]And then there is... That's it.
[97:13.81]Because there's only two.
[97:15.29]There are two equinoxes.
[97:17.13]Because the equinox only appears twice.
[97:20.99]B for me.
[97:22.77]So this is... Yes.
[97:24.89]Thank you.
[97:30.20]I almost ran away when he was inaugurated.

[98:04.63]Salicylic acid is...
[98:10.91]It's either tea tree or sycamore.
[98:16.78]I should know this.

[108:53.84]Yale.
[108:56.58]This is this.
[108:57.00]This is quite a few.
[109:02.66]Couldn't give you the exact number though.
[109:04.58]So we're going to do ask the audience.
[109:07.57]There are eight.
[109:12.73]None is a type of flatbread traditional in which country is cooking.
[109:25.56]Okay.
[109:28.08]Now this is tough.
[109:29.30]This is tough because I love this stuff.
[109:32.59]But where... Where is it traditionally... What country traditionally is it from?
[109:39.59]Greece?
[109:41.01]India?
[109:41.75]Or Turkey?
[109:44.23]I think it's India or Turkey.
[109:47.47]I'm gonna... I... I... Mmm... I eat this stuff all the fucking time.
[109:52.19]I love naan.
[109:53.97]But, like, where was it originally... What was the original... Country of origin?
[110:00.42]I'm gonna say India.
[110:02.83]gonna say India but I think it's turkey and I'm afraid to click this I think I'm gonna have to just go for it and just click turkey because that might it's keep saying go for it that's where it's really from and it was India and this is why multiple choice questions just rip them up because I got I had the question right well it's no big deal I still had a good time
[110:31.65]But then I'm just sitting there going, wait a minute.
[110:32.87]Where's the original origin?
[110:34.81]Is it Turkey?
[110:35.64]Is it India?
[110:37.98]If you just asked me that question, if we just were sitting there and you said, what country is naan bread from?
[110:43.54]I'd say India.
[110:45.99]But when you give me four options that could be correct, it's over.
[110:51.11]It's over.
[111:03.23]second guessing well that's the whole point of a multiple choice question it's still like multiple choice questions throughout history have been the right answers here but we're gonna with you we're gonna with you on this question because it's gonna be something that could be correct but you you're gonna get it wrong I'm sure that it's b okay we have faith
[111:32.49]no more second guessing we're going we're going for it what type of creature is Jerry in the cartoon series Tom and Jerry oh he's a rhinoceros uh in the TV series The Simpsons who provides the voice for Lisa
[111:58.42]uh yeah that is Bart it's weirdly I'm going to bet on b good luck who has never played superman in a movie mel gibson it's definitely mel gibson I feel like that his multiple choice
[112:23.55]That's the right answer, but like... But there was this one made-for-fucking-TV movie back in 1982 where Mel Gibson was Superman in Superman Attack of the Mutants.
[112:35.97]I'm going to get this question wrong.
[112:36.93]I think it's Ace.
[112:42.29]Okay.
[112:43.89]You got it.
[112:44.21]Perfectly executed.
[112:49.87]I think we all agree that we can move on to this new question.

[135:21.00]Do you guys care if I look it up?

[149:17.37]Antonio helped.
[149:18.09]Yeah, but he was like, I don't know.
[149:20.45]I could.
[149:20.99]I don't know.
[149:22.29]It's probably D. I don't.
[149:25.01]That was not a confident D. To what or whom does the queen ask whether she is the fairest of them all?
[149:35.12]King.
[149:37.92]Her magic bed.

[150:04.49]This is English.
[150:05.09]This is British shit, isn't it?
[150:05.99]This is British shit.
[150:07.71]Oh, but one cook spoils the broth.
[150:09.73]Never heard this before.

[150:14.20]This is British or English.
[150:15.50]This is European.
[150:17.64]This has to be.
[150:19.16]That's what I would pick.
[150:20.63]Because that's... Oh, but one cook spoiled the broth.
[150:23.65]No, wait.
[150:24.41]Only three cooks spoiled the broth.
[150:26.97]Too many cooks spoiled the broth.
[150:28.71]Not enough cooks spoiled the broth.
[150:31.37]I mean, that's bad.
[150:33.13]Too many cooks spoiled the broth.
[150:35.55]Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[150:36.61]That's the American one.
[150:39.77]I think we all agree that we can move on to this new question.

[156:02.11]But I'm not confident.
[156:03.07]I really don't know.
[156:04.67]So the first time I'm going to ask the audience is right.
[156:07.36]No.
[156:10.70]The audience isn't going to know this either.
[156:12.44]But whatever.
[156:13.00]Okay.
[156:18.64]I would not have gotten this.
[156:19.77]I have no idea.
[156:20.27]I did not know.
[156:23.81]Did a single fucking person in the audience put D?
[156:30.40]I mean one single person in the audience.
[156:33.12]Nice shot.
[156:34.26]Respect for playing the game.

[156:47.73]98% of the audience got it wrong.
[156:50.19]It was Anne Hathaway.
[156:55.47]Ask the audience only works up until like $2,000 by the way.
[156:59.13]So we need to use it early.
[157:01.73]That was a good one, too.
[157:02.59]That was, that was horseshit.
[157:04.25]You all know it.

[157:33.40]Grizzly.
[157:35.63]A grumpy bear.

[158:52.61]What kind of food is Limeswold?
[159:02.11]Well, lime.
[159:04.59]Lime.
[159:06.79]Means citrus.
[159:09.33]So citrus adjacent.
[159:11.76]Wooled.
[159:13.18]Wooled is another name for a crunchy tart.
[159:20.80]So I'd have to say biscuit because biscuit can have a little bit of a little bit of that malic acid.
[159:30.04]Apple has malic acid in it.
[159:32.92]And it's part of the citrus family.
[159:48.91]The apple is a citrus fruit.
[159:52.38]I would get it if you were like, what does he talk?
[159:55.20]Some people probably just leave the stream.
[159:57.34]When I say apples are a citrus fruit and it's the last thing you hear before you click the X because you have something to do.
[160:03.42]Then yeah, I get like, why is he like so stupid?
[160:05.42]I don't get it.
[160:06.38]Just settle down.
[160:07.18]We're just hanging out.
[160:08.20]We're just fucking around.
[160:08.96]I get it.
[160:10.44]I understand it though.
[160:11.36]Like if I say that and you leave, you're going to really think I think that apples is citrus fruit.
[160:16.17]I understand.
[160:19.62]Alright, in which James Bond film did Pierce Brosnan make his first appearance as 007?
[160:25.74]It's not GoldenEye.
[160:26.97]GoldenEye, I think, is the second time.
[160:30.01]Although, fuck, it might have been the first.
[160:33.70]Tomorrow Never Dies and GoldenEye are the two.
[160:37.23]GoldenEye, I think, was the second one.
[160:39.13]Tomorrow Never Dies was either the second one or the first one.
[160:41.65]I don't remember what order they came out in.
[160:43.07]I just remember burning daylight playing this on my Nintendo 64.
[160:50.08]And that's the only thing I remember.
[160:51.40]I believe... Ugh.
[160:55.16]Tomorrow Never Dies is definitely not it.
[160:58.54]It's this one.
[161:00.88]GoldenEye007.
[161:03.31]It was a big deal.
[161:04.05]It was the new Bond at the time.
[161:07.03]And it was a banger.
[161:10.53]Tomorrow Never Dies is the sequel.
[161:14.01]It's definitely, I'm overthinking this like crazy.
[161:16.55]It's Goldeneye.
[161:19.29]I'm overthinking, am I overthinking this?
[161:20.77]I'm overthinking this.
[161:21.82]It's fucking Goldeneye.
[161:23.10]Get it, do it.
[161:25.90]Thank you.
[161:26.36]Stop, you got it.
[161:30.97]The horror film The Shining is based on a novel by Stephen King.
[161:36.75]Alright, where are we at?
[161:41.25]8,000.
[161:44.71]Madame Medusa is the villain of which Disney movie?
[161:50.09]That's Ursula.
[161:53.55]A cauldron.
[161:59.82]I don't know.
[162:04.06]But I would say this one.
[162:08.06]The Fox and the Hound.
[162:08.97]I don't remember the being.
[162:09.67]I'm going to say it's either the rescuers or the Black Cauldron.
[162:20.12]Do I have all my lifelines?
[162:21.08]I do.
[162:31.26]Don't rush me, I'm thinking.
[162:37.48]The rescuers.
[162:38.40]The rescuers are the... It's the little animals, right?
[162:46.65]It's the rescuers.
[162:49.99]It's like the little mice and rats and stuff, right?
[162:53.31]Yeah, it's definitely A. It's definitely A. It has to be.
[162:57.63]No single doubt in my mind.
[162:59.32]It's A.
[163:02.80]Yep.
[163:04.80]Madam Medusa, snake.
[163:06.69]Yeah, okay.
[163:07.29]We're at 16k.
[163:08.15]Let's go.
[163:09.29]All lifelines intact, by the way.
[163:14.43]Carrots are a particularly good source of which vitamin?
[163:17.47]Vitamin A. Beta carotene.
[163:20.63]That's the $32,000 question.
[163:30.73]Alright, all lifelines intact.
[163:32.57]All of them.
[163:34.63]How many original patriarchs or gurus of the Sikh religion were there?
[163:41.37]Original.
[163:43.49]Any time there's just like a singular number.
[163:48.43]I think I'm just going new question.
[163:56.20]Which of these islands are not in the Pacific Ocean?
[164:02.45]Shit.
[164:07.53]Not in the Pacific.
[164:11.64]Goodness gracious.
[164:14.14]Oh, we're in trouble here.
[164:15.04]I think this is a phone call.
[164:20.32]Who would know geography?
[164:31.43]Cousin.
[164:32.41]Sister.
[164:36.03]It should show their profession.
[164:38.63]Like, sister.
[164:39.87]Clown.
[164:40.73]Antonio.
[164:41.37]Dentist.
[164:42.47]Thomas.
[164:44.87]Teacher.
[164:45.19]I don't know.
[164:50.69]Let's go... I'm not doing Antonio again.
[164:58.15]Fine.
[165:03.47]We keep calling this guy.
[165:04.83]Haven't I answered three or four questions out of a million?
[165:09.20]I feel like that's worth at least 30%, Lindsay.
[165:10.88]Cayman Islands.
[165:34.25]I hope you're right.
[165:35.19]Yeah.
[165:39.66]Alright.
[165:40.28]Let's go.
[165:41.12]We're good.
[165:41.52]We're good.
[165:41.84]We're good.
[165:42.36]We're good.
[165:42.80]We're good.
[165:45.52]We're good.
[165:46.12]64,000.
[165:46.16]Which animal is a chimney sweep in Alice in Wonderland?
[165:53.31]It's been so long since I've seen this fucking movie.
[165:59.41]It's not a caterpillar.
[166:00.31]That's the... Definitely not the chimney sweep.
[166:08.64]The rabbit is the... I'm late!
[166:10.32]I'm late!
[166:10.56]I have a clock!
[166:11.06]I gotta go fast!
[166:14.32]So it's either a lizard or a ferret.
[166:22.05]I don't remember there being a lizard in Alice in Wonderland.
[166:27.43]But I don't remember there being a ferret either.
[166:32.01]I'm going to bet on B. Chimney sweep.
[166:35.73]I'm trying to picture it in my head.
[166:38.31]But this, I don't remember a ferret at all.
[166:41.03]A lizard could be there.
[166:41.99]A ferret is not there.
[166:43.43]There's no ferret in Alice in Wonderland.
[166:48.29]Alright.
[166:51.35]Come on, we're almost there.
[166:56.01]$125,000.
[166:56.03]We got, what, two lifelines?
[166:58.86]One of them's useless because it's the audience.
[167:01.99]What is a Gorgaine?
[167:04.66]Which appears in some traditional Quebec recipes.
[167:08.58]A Gorgaine.
[167:12.74]I don't know.
[167:15.08]Ava bean, a Gorg, Gorgon, Gorgaine, lentil, pea.
[167:29.16]I just know this from Silence of the Lambs.
[167:41.29]I can't really take a guess.
[167:42.49]I honestly just can't.
[167:43.67]So, let's see what the audience has to say.
[167:45.37]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it.
[167:47.47]Okay.
[167:50.23]There's no way 75% of the entire audience would pick the wrong answer.
[167:57.19]How many people are in the audience?
[167:59.17]Like 100?
[167:59.73]200 people?
[168:01.21]100 people?
[168:02.13]There's no way that this mini got it wrong.
[168:05.84]But is it just wrong?
[168:12.33]That's so many people to get this question wrong.
[168:16.23]But did some of them get it right?
[168:17.53]Because I was going to say B. The last time I trusted the overwhelming majority in the audience, it was completely wrong.
[168:27.68]I feel like a P is too simple.
[168:29.58]I feel like that's not correct.
[168:32.86]I think I'm going to go with Fava Bean and be pissed because I didn't go with the audience that actually got it right this time.
[168:44.06]Come on.
[168:48.82]Thank you.
[168:49.52]The audience is so bad.
[168:51.70]You are so bad.
[168:53.22]I'm never trusting them ever again.
[168:54.44]There's only two more questions.
[169:02.18]Which is the Roman equivalent of the Greek god of the underworld?
[169:07.30]Hold on.
[169:08.47]Roman.
[169:09.75]That's... It's not Bologna.
[169:12.57]Cronus is... It's Nox.
[169:15.83]It's Nox.
[169:17.45]We're at the million dollar question with a lifeline.
[169:21.82]We're at the one million dollar question.
[169:27.96]Hope you guys are ready.
[169:30.86]Let me think about this one more time because it's definitely Nox, but hold on.
[169:35.24]Elona is not the Roman equivalent of the Greek god of the underworld.
[169:40.63]Cronus was...
[169:44.07]Fuck.
[169:44.97]I'm second.
[169:45.45]I'm getting in my head again.
[169:46.47]I'm getting in my head.
[169:47.07]This is half a million.
[169:51.72]Stop.
[169:52.04]It's Nox.
[169:52.86]Nox.
[169:53.36]It's Nox.
[169:53.84]It's Nox.
[169:54.52]It's Nox.
[169:58.90]Cronus was... What is this?
[170:02.60]This?
[170:06.32]Shit.
[170:06.64]I don't know.
[170:07.36]I'm all fucked up over this.
[170:18.29]But what if it's wrong?
[170:19.37]What if I'm overthinking this, but I'm overthinking it for a good reason this time?
[170:25.45]Because it is Cronus.
[170:27.65]But it's not.
[170:31.27]What if it's Diz?
[170:34.06]I'll be honest with you.
[170:34.96]I don't think I've ever heard.
[170:36.16]I don't know about this.
[170:39.50]It could just be Diz.
[170:45.94]This chat, I don't even want to look at it, but it's a mess.
[170:50.86]Nox is not the... Is Nox the underworld?
[170:53.44]Nox is... She holds the candle.
[170:56.82]She's got the three... And her three is a dash forward.
[171:00.27]And it makes a big thing.
[171:01.33]And depending on how many people you hit with your auto attack, that's Nox, right?
[171:05.57]Bologna is, you know, you've got the sword.
[171:07.15]You can dance switch to sword and shield to, you know, tanky guardian slash warrior.
[171:14.82]I'm going to go in this final answer.
[171:16.83]I hope it's right.
[171:19.83]It better be this or I'm going to be very mad.
[171:22.85]It has to be.
[171:23.69]There's no other alternative.
[171:28.09]Yes.
[171:28.77]Alright.
[171:29.37]I'm so glad I overthought that.
[171:31.01]This is it.
[171:33.01]One million dollar question.
[171:37.92]I just broke my chair.
[171:42.52]This new question is now waiting for you to be answered with flying... In 2020, how many full-length Winnie the Pooh movies had been released ever?
[171:54.09]Ever.
[171:59.41]How many full-length... Okay, there's Winnie the Pooh.
[172:03.52]There's Winnie the Pooh Goes to New York.
[172:06.07]There's Winnie the Pooh and the Great Muppet Caper.
[172:08.53]There's Winnie the Pooh and Friends.
[172:11.25]Hold on.
[172:11.57]There's... Well, you know what?
[172:13.61]We're gonna do this.
[172:14.27]Because, yo.
[172:15.63]Fuck that.
[172:17.79]It's a coin flip regardless.
[172:20.91]Okay.
[172:23.37]I don't think there's been ten Winnie the Pooh movies.
[172:25.51]There's not been ten.
[172:26.51]Ten?! !
[172:31.61]Ten Winnie the Pooh movies?
[172:33.17]There's no way there was ten.
[172:35.43]Seven.
[172:36.89]Seven for a million bucks.
[172:39.81]Let me just sit here and think.
[172:41.73]These are... All of these would have came out between like 1980 and 1995.
[172:45.27]I can't think of more than two.
[172:52.72]So there being seven is shocking to me.
[172:59.10]Seven is already shocking.
[173:04.79]Give me the million.
[173:05.87]Give me the million.
[173:06.45]Give me the million.
[173:07.01]Give me the million.
[173:07.55]Give me the million.
[173:08.09]Give me the million.
[173:08.65]Give me the million.
[173:09.17]Give it a minute.
[173:09.79]Give me the million.
[173:11.78]Oh my God.
[173:13.08]That's not the music.
[173:13.78]That's not the right music.
[173:14.48]I was like, why does it sound so fucked up?
[173:16.96]Why is the sound effect so weird?
[173:18.82]This 10 Winnie the Pooh movies.
[173:20.32]What do you mean we told you?
[173:21.04]You guys were all saying yay.
[173:21.68]You guys were all saying yes.
[173:33.53]It was a sea of green lights!
[173:35.57]It was a sea of green!
[173:42.03]There's ten Winnie the Pooh movies?
[173:43.95]What the fuck even are they?
[173:46.16]Winnie- Full-length Winnie the Pooh movies!
[173:50.70]You gotta be shitting me.
[173:55.86]Winnie the Pooh.
[173:57.36]Hold on a second.
[173:59.88]I can't believe there are ten.
[174:03.71]Oh, you guys fucked with me on purpose.
[174:05.19]Okay.
[174:07.39]That's sad.
[174:08.73]You're not going to let me get a million dollars?
[174:11.00]That was it.
[174:18.42]Winnie the Pooh is one of the most iconic characters in pop culture, and these are the seven theatrically released films about him ranked.
[174:25.81]There were seven.
[174:29.81]Where are the other three movies?
[174:39.56]Okay, how... Wait a minute.
[174:44.04]How many Winnie the Pooh movies are there?
[174:45.96]Winnie the Pooh... There are seven Winnie the Pooh movies!
[174:48.65]I win!
[174:50.17]Can I get a... Can I get like a recount?
[174:52.51]There are seven Winnie the Pooh movies.
[174:53.89]I won a million dollars.
[174:54.51]I win.
[174:55.95]Three were straight to DVD.
[174:58.75]Oh.
[175:01.44]That's how they get you.
[175:03.71]So that's how they got you.
[175:08.22]Because everybody would be like, wait, there was seven.
[175:10.02]But then they don't think of the ones at the bottom of the fucking bargain bin at your local video store that had three stickers on it.
[175:19.53]The first sticker was yellow and said eight bucks.
[175:22.45]The second sticker is red and is two bucks.
[175:26.15]And it's on top of the yellow sticker.
[175:29.13]So, sorry.
[175:31.12]I did not know about the other three.
[175:33.50]I still take that as a win.
[175:36.58]I think that's kind of where I need to stop playing Millionaire, because I... I fake won the million.
[175:42.75]But we'll do one more, just for fun.
[175:54.05]That was the run.
[175:55.21]I can't believe it wasn't 7.
[175:57.43]It's so funny because you guys all googled it.
[176:00.01]That's why you were saying green light.
[176:04.41]You guys googled it and saw 7.
[176:09.13]That's so funny.
[176:10.97]That's worth losing that question because that's really funny.
[176:15.65]Even Google didn't help.
[176:16.65]Alright, last one and then we'll do something else for a little bit.
[176:21.87]The abbreviation USA stands for United States of... The United Sheep of Australia.
[176:29.67]The United Sausages of Austria.
[176:31.49]Alright, I'll be right back.
[176:44.28]We'll do something like an hour or so.
[176:48.26]I will be RB.
[176:50.40]I'm going to pick a game out of a hat.
[176:53.74]That was fun though.
[176:56.44]I enjoyed that.
[176:57.80]I had the itch to play it.
[176:59.02]Almost won the million dollars, but we can just pretend I did because we all got it wrong.
[177:03.71]I'll be right back.
[177:27.95]Okay, I know what I'm going to do.
[177:28.81]I'm just going to play for like an hour.
[177:32.43]But I'm about to make like three of you really, really excited.
[177:36.63]The rest of you are just going to be like, oh, okay, cool.
[177:39.13]But for at least two or three of you, you're going to fall out of your seat.
[177:41.53]I'm going to play Neon White.
[177:45.43]Just going to check it out.
[177:46.35]Play for like an hour or two.
[177:50.11]I'll be right back.
