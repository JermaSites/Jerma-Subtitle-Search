[00:08.62]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.28]Jeremiah here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing, oh, bang, as the heavy live stipulation match.
[00:18.62]Come here.
[00:19.32]Come here.
[00:20.80]Oh, damn it.
[00:22.28]Live stipulation match as the heavy, as you can see, with the Killing Gloves of Boxing.
[00:26.47]Dr. Pepper?
[00:29.01]Mmm.
[00:30.83]I don't know how well this is going to go, but I'm only allowed to use the Killing Gloves of Boxing.
[00:36.05]Let's see if I can't.
[00:40.05]Come on, alright, I'm gonna bait him, I'm gonna bait him.
[00:43.65]Where'd he go?
[00:44.75]Come on, I gotta bait this guy.
[00:46.40]Will you just get in here?
[00:49.08]Come on!
[00:50.54]Oh, now there's a mini sentry, give me some health.
[00:53.96]Playing on Frontier, which is... I love this map, but no one really ever plays it.
[00:58.90]I think it's because it's really, really big.
[01:00.92]Oh, this guy.
[01:01.96]No, no, no, no, no.
[01:03.14]I'm going to go up here.
[01:04.25]Let me eat.
[01:04.63]No, I don't even need to.
[01:05.71]There's a health pack.
[01:08.89]Can I catch somebody off guard right here?
[01:10.69]Come on.
[01:14.21]Right here.
[01:14.67]Right here.
[01:16.43]Say hello to my little friend.
[01:19.85]Hello there.
[01:20.49]No.
[01:22.48]Oh, come on.
[01:25.42]Two guys blew themselves up on me.
[01:28.37]Oh, for the love of crap, you are not a spy.
[01:33.35]Let's just eat this right here.
[01:35.81]Nom, nom, nom.
[01:37.95]Gotta get another kill.
[01:38.80]We gotta get, like, two or three more kills.
[01:41.74]That scout right there is dead.
[01:44.32]I'm gonna walk up the steps, and I'm gonna put... Whoa, what?
[01:47.06]What is going on?
[01:47.76]Oh, they're over the... Come here!
[01:53.72]Oh!
[01:54.18]Mmm!
[01:59.70]Good job.
[02:00.90]Good job, Scout.
[02:03.26]Let's get back in this.
[02:04.20]I've got people to punch in the face.
[02:05.52]Come on.
[02:09.00]What do I got?
[02:09.48]One kill so far?
[02:11.01]Or three, technically?
[02:12.07]Because those guys both blew themselves up.
[02:13.63]I don't know.
[02:14.45]You call that three?
[02:16.69]I've got to get like ten kills.
[02:18.47]That was a bad number to say.
[02:20.07]Because I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that.
[02:26.00]Here we go.
[02:28.32]I'm going to jump over the edge here.
[02:30.44]Be a heavy spy.
[02:31.52]It'll work.
[02:33.86]This sniper wants me so bad.
[02:37.41]I'll get this sniper.
[02:38.11]I'm going to get this guy right here.
[02:40.63]That counts as one.
[02:41.93]Hey, sniper.
[02:42.89]What?
[02:43.47]Where is he?
[02:44.71]Did he get killed?
[02:46.15]Oh, damn it.
[02:49.23]There's the sniper.
[02:50.23]There's the sniper.
[02:50.93]This guy's AFK.
[02:52.40]Come on, kill him before I... Come here.
[02:55.75]Oh, no, I can't go down here.
[02:56.97]This guy's going to just shoot me.
[02:58.85]Here we go.
[03:00.29]Come on, eat the sandwich.
[03:01.29]Eat it.
[03:02.27]Eat it, you fat bastard.
[03:04.82]Sniper's right here.
[03:06.78]Where are you?
[03:08.52]Oh, hey, what's up, man?
[03:11.12]Come on, come on, come on.
[03:12.28]Get up the stairs.
[03:15.02]Somebody's right here.
[03:17.10]Oh!
[03:21.17]Where's this guy?
[03:21.77]Come on, he went down here.
[03:23.53]No, he's dead.
[03:23.97]He's dead.
[03:24.49]He's dead.
[03:24.83]We're good.
[03:25.33]We're good.
[03:27.68]Oh, I'm so scared right now.
[03:29.78]I am terrified right now.
[03:32.50]I gotta wait for someone to drop down.
[03:33.72]Oh, just get on the cot?
[03:39.10]Come on!
[03:40.16]Get it!
[03:41.14]Get it!
[03:41.78]Oh!
[03:42.38]No, I fell off the cot!
[03:44.10]Oh!
[03:47.52]I fell off the cot!
[03:49.50]We're gonna win.
[03:50.20]That's a win right there.
[03:52.40]Two thumbs up right here, come on!
[03:54.47]Good job, guys, good job.
[03:56.89]Yeah.
[03:59.91]I don't even know how many kills that was.
[04:01.43]What did I say I wanted to get?
[04:02.27]Ten?
[04:04.13]One, two, three in the beginning.
[04:05.55]Four, five... Alright, I still owe, like, probably four or five kills, so let's see if we can get them.
[04:13.36]Come on, boys, let's do it!
[04:20.70]Come on, 60 seconds.
[04:22.80]Time travel!
[04:24.44]Alright, here we are.
[04:26.26]Gonna sit here.
[04:27.52]I'm gonna wait for them to come out, and I'm going to attack.
[04:32.44]Not gonna move.
[04:32.92]Don't move.
[04:34.36]Play this like a spy.
[04:36.02]Don't move.
[04:37.87]Here we go.
[04:38.91]Here we go.
[04:39.93]Here we go.
[04:41.03]No, never mind.
[04:42.51]Hey, spy, get out of my spy spot!
[04:48.51]Here we go.
[04:50.32]I am going to catch a son of a bitch around this corner.
[04:53.58]Here we go.
[04:53.98]This is it.
[04:55.86]Yeah!
[04:57.10]Oh!
[04:58.10]Crit sniper?
[04:58.84]Are you serious?
[05:00.60]This, this, no!
[05:02.46]I got backstabbed.
[05:04.78]Oh, I had that.
[05:06.77]I would have punched that medic right in his mouth face.
[05:11.79]Oh, I had that too.
[05:13.01]I can't believe a crit sniper came out of nowhere.
[05:16.77]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[05:21.69]I'm cool with sitting here.
[05:22.59]Come on, push the cart.
[05:24.03]Push it a little bit.
[05:25.65]There you go.
[05:28.13]Come on.
[05:29.95]Come on, push it.
[05:32.29]Push the... Alright, you know, let's just go in.
[05:35.46]We're going in for the... Here it is.
[05:36.66]Oh, yeah!
[05:40.54]Get somebody else.
[05:42.68]Get somebody else.
[05:43.92]Somebody walk right through this hallway and just smash.
[05:48.32]Nope.
[05:49.14]Is that a... I thought that was a teleporter for a second.
[05:51.20]What the hell?
[05:53.20]Heal to full.
[05:53.94]I'm behind enemy lines right now.
[05:55.79]I got a good thing going on right here.
[05:58.77]Oh, I think that guy saw me.
[06:00.17]I think that pyro just saw me.
[06:01.41]Oh, crap.
[06:07.21]Come here.
[06:08.72]Oh, no.
[06:11.54]Come here.
[06:13.92]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[06:20.29]I would have had him.
[06:24.53]I would have had him.
[06:27.57]Where are we going here?
[06:28.17]Where are we going here?
[06:28.75]Come on.
[06:29.73]Oh, they capped it.
[06:32.07]Alright, two more lives.
[06:32.99]Two more lives.
[06:33.57]That's what I'm asking here.
[06:34.93]Gotta get like one or two more kills in the next two lives.
[06:39.53]Am I going the right way?
[06:40.53]Yes, I am.
[06:44.49]This is a good spot to be in.
[06:45.55]I can sit right up here.
[06:47.66]I want to string together, like, three kills in a row.
[06:50.74]Oh, I'm sorry, Engineer.
[06:51.54]I'm, like, taking your spot.
[06:56.28]There's one!
[06:58.07]No!
[06:58.47]No, another sniper!
[06:59.99]That's what?
[07:00.47]It was a spy!
[07:01.13]Come on!
[07:05.81]This guy has no idea!
[07:06.95]He has no idea!
[07:07.65]At least I got him.
[07:11.25]Alright, one more death.
[07:12.59]One more death allowed.
[07:15.72]How many kills do I have?
[07:16.70]10.
[07:16.96]Alright, I got to my goal.
[07:18.22]I got to my goal.
[07:18.94]I got 10 kills.
[07:20.40]That was my goal.
[07:21.68]Let's see if I can pad that goal a little bit here.
[07:25.14]Let's hope so.
[07:30.20]Last life.
[07:31.52]Come on, here it is.
[07:37.46]What?
[07:37.70]I just bumped into... Yeah, I knew it.
[07:39.14]I knew it.
[07:39.82]What?
[07:40.22]Oh, it's a pyro.
[07:41.68]Pyro spy.
[07:42.38]Hey, what's up, dude?
[07:43.68]You wanna do it again?
[07:44.46]Come on.
[07:44.94]Do the stair stab again.
[07:48.14]Aww.
[07:49.16]No, there he is.
[07:50.78]No, you ain't gonna get me!
[07:54.43]I gotta chase this guy now.
[07:56.45]Oh, fantastic.
[07:57.75]Oh, please don't jump and backstab me.
[07:59.35]Please don't do it.
[08:02.33]What the?
[08:02.83]What?
[08:03.49]I just got so freaked out right there.
[08:07.15]There is a spy up here, man.
[08:08.43]I'm telling you.
[08:10.83]It's alright.
[08:11.25]Whatever.
[08:12.31]He's gonna kill you.
[08:13.29]I'm sorry.
[08:13.77]There's nothing I can do.
[08:14.49]I can jump over here, though.
[08:18.09]Oh, no.
[08:18.53]Mini Sentry.
[08:21.57]Yes!
[08:21.91]There it is.
[08:22.31]11.
[08:22.69]11 kills.
[08:24.09]Oh, make that 12.
[08:25.37]Make that 12.
[08:26.73]Come here, you... Mini Sentry just annihilated me.
[08:32.27]Oh, and there it is.
[08:35.29]Well, that's going to do it for this live stipulation match, guys.
[08:38.43]Thank you so much for watching.
[08:39.35]I really do appreciate it.
[08:44.42]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[08:45.92]And of course, take care, everybody.
[08:50.63]See you guys soon.
