[00:01.97]Hello!
[00:02.41]How are you?
[00:04.65]That's good.
[00:09.86]That's good!
[00:10.52]That's good!
[00:13.92]I'm on time, of course I am.
[00:21.06]We've got a day of festivities today.
[00:25.60]At least a few festivities.
[00:30.54]Gonna be playing BeamNG Drive.
[00:36.89]Which, I was gonna do scary horror stuff today, but I just didn't feel like it.
[00:41.80]I'll be honest.
[00:44.50]I just didn't want to do it.
[00:47.47]So this game's kind of complicated.
[00:48.59]There's a lot going on in this game.
[00:50.31]I don't really know what I'm going to do.
[00:52.53]Seems like you kind of really need to figure out how to play it first.
[00:55.93]So this is going to be Tutorial Andy for a little while.
[00:59.42]If it's too complicated for my tiny brain, then I will move on to Webbed.
[01:04.88]I've been wanting to play Webbed for a little while.
[01:10.47]You're a coward.
[01:11.53]You've literally played this game before.
[01:13.29]I have not played this game before.
[01:14.93]No, no, no.
[01:16.87]You're confusing it with every other time I've crashed a car and laughed.
[01:20.04]I know there's been hundreds of times.
[01:23.06]Potentially thousands of times.
[01:27.26]I mean, this whole stream, you could probably put next to one of the other games where you crash cars.
[01:31.20]And it'd probably be the same stream.
[01:36.85]But, first and foremost, well, hold on.
[01:42.77]have to warn you, I may have fucked this up pretty badly.
[01:49.02]I may have... Well, whatever.
[01:54.18]I'm gonna wait till there's more than 5k people here.
[01:57.06]I'm gonna chill.
[01:57.64]Give me a second.
[01:58.41]Hold on.
[03:36.48]Okay.
[03:37.24]Hello.
[03:37.52]I just had to get something real quick.
[03:42.72]Mod check?
[03:43.32]What?
[03:48.67]Is this a sleep stream?
[03:52.49]Why would I do a sleep stream?
[03:53.79]What are you talking about?
[03:54.39]Let me see.
[03:56.87]Hold on.
[03:57.39]I just ran up and down stairs.
[04:00.31]Hold on.
[04:00.89]Okay.
[04:02.61]Laughing at car crash compilation?
[04:04.07]I...
[04:06.05]Let me learn how to play the game first.
[04:11.81]You guys are going to laugh, and I don't... You're going to laugh.
[04:16.09]Everybody's going to laugh.
[04:16.99]Because here's your glove.
[04:24.12]Fits perfectly, as you see.
[04:27.68]It fits perfectly.
[04:29.82]I had this custom fit to make sure I could, you know, wear it.
[04:36.93]I promise.
[04:37.79]I promise I didn't sit on it.
[04:39.82]I didn't sit on this and get really mad and get very upset that I sat on it.
[04:50.52]I wonder how this glove tastes.
[04:57.55]Homer Simpson?
[05:00.47]What is that?
[05:01.09]Is that leather?
[05:01.61]Not bad.
[05:10.49]You sat on it?
[05:22.10]Now that's fresh leather.
[05:24.04]What are these gloves even supposed to be made out of?
[05:25.50]Hold on, hold on.
[05:31.04]I wish I had two.
[05:33.26]This looks like... Oh, this looks like fucking Spongebob got run over by a car.
[05:39.88]And I, like, stole this.
[05:46.38]Oh, ow.
[05:49.54]Whoa, watch out.
[05:50.56]My thumb.
[05:51.12]Hold on.
[05:56.89]Ow.
[06:02.59]What the hell is he doing?
[06:08.94]You know what I've realized about this channel?
[06:12.14]I'm starting to realize it more and more.
[06:15.44]If you don't watch every single fucking stream, you're not going to have any idea what's going on.
[06:25.43]I feel bad for the people that I catch a stream once every couple weeks.
[06:30.53]What the fuck are you doing?
[06:31.87]Stop.
[06:32.11]What are you doing?
[06:32.61]Stop this.
[06:36.48]Pretty good.
[06:42.05]I can't make a middle finger.
[06:43.13]There's not five fingers.
[06:48.55]You have more lore than Dark Souls.
[06:50.41]I don't think that's accurate.
[06:51.33]I just think that there's weird shit that happens like every other day.
[06:55.81]What finger should I bite next?
[07:04.10]Put your middle finger through the middle.
[07:09.62]Ah, yeah!
[07:10.26]Hold on.
[07:14.53]You know what?
[07:15.03]Yeah.
[07:16.15]Fuck you.
[07:16.61]Mike, it's too hard to do a flip.
[07:27.58]Get the pinky.
[07:28.92]This pinky right here, right?
[07:33.24]Looks like I have an egg in my mouth.
[07:35.10]All I can tell you is it's made out of fucking eggs.
[07:38.36]Oh, it looks like an egg!
[07:48.45]What is that?
[07:49.31]Is that edible?
[07:51.35]Wait, I think that's not edible.
[07:54.16]I don't think that part's edible.
[07:57.78]That part's not edible.
[07:59.98]I think that's stuffing.
[08:09.77]Hey, okay.
[08:11.17]All right, I ate another glove.
[08:13.19]Okay.
[08:14.03]All right, I'm done.
[08:15.13]I'm done.
[08:15.55]I'm out.
[08:16.39]I'm done.
[08:16.75]Wait, I got one more bite for the camera.
[08:24.56]I'm not eating at all.
[08:30.10]What about, like, I can't swallow this.
[08:31.76]It's fucking pure sugar.
[08:34.39]I mean, pure leather.
[08:36.97]I have to spit this out.
[08:39.42]I'm going to puke.
[08:44.24]I'm not eating the whole glove.
[08:50.83]I'm not eating the whole glove.
[08:52.57]I'm taking a few bites.
[08:54.77]I didn't eat the whole shoe.
[08:57.39]You guys didn't hear that, did you?
[09:00.77]I hope not.
[09:02.47]I didn't eat the whole shoe.
[09:03.31]Why would I eat the whole glove?
[09:05.57]Come on.
[09:11.16]I can't... Okay.
[09:13.39]How about, like, right here?
[09:20.33]This looks so fucking weird.
[09:22.87]Give him the silent treatment.
[09:23.95]He has to finish the glove.
[09:24.89]I'm not finishing the glove.
[09:25.77]I'll take one more bite right here for the thumbnail.
[09:28.62]Like, this is fucking weird.
[09:37.58]Don't give me the silent treatment.
[09:38.64]Give me something else.
[09:42.37]By the way, I'm never, I'm never saying this again.
[09:45.32]I was, if you, if you're curious what's going on, let me just explain real quick for people who have no idea what's going on.
[09:50.10]I was convinced that the Three Stooges were going to be in Fortnite.
[09:52.82]Two years ago, I made a bet.
[09:54.42]I said the Three Stooges will be in Fortnite by some, what, last week of April 2022.
[09:59.70]It didn't happen, which is horseshit.
[10:02.31]Like, I don't know why they wouldn't have been added.
[10:04.15]They probably will get added.
[10:05.33]I still believe that.
[10:06.73]I genuinely believe the Three Stooges are going to be in Fortnite.
[10:10.43]I believe it.
[10:10.99]Genuinely.
[10:13.17]It's just a matter of time.
[10:14.57]So look, you can come back to this video whenever the three Stooges get added and be like, holy shit, I actually had to eat that glove thing and they actually got added.
[10:23.79]But if the three Stooges are not added to Fortnite by April 3rd of 2030, I will have already been retired, so who cares?
[10:40.42]Okay, goodbye.
[10:42.15]My hands are so sticky.
[10:43.73]I'll be right back.
[10:44.37]I'll be right back.
[10:45.18]We'll go back to the intro.
[10:45.88]I'm going to put this in the freezer.
[10:51.78]Yeah, I'm going to the freezer.
[10:53.55]I'll be back.
[10:56.27]I'm so... Oh, this is bad.
[10:58.03]I can't touch anything.
[10:58.77]Yeah, I can.
[10:59.05]Here we go.
[14:41.87]Okay, hi.
[14:43.42]Everything's, I just, my hands are all sugar all over them.
[14:47.90]It was a very sugary leather glove.
[14:51.78]Okay.
[14:57.37]You ate a glove?
[14:57.99]Yeah.
[14:59.35]You missed it.
[15:01.31]It was crazy.
[15:09.53]Alright, yeah, so we're doing BeamNG.
[15:11.01]I know people are saying, dude, you gotta, oh, BeamNG, man.
[15:17.57]Gotta go get this mod and go get that mod and go get that to download that thing and go download that car pack and get this.
[15:22.67]Let's start.
[15:23.37]Look, this is Baby Steps.
[15:24.37]I've never played this.
[15:26.21]Let me just see if I enjoy.
[15:27.67]I'm going to do the tutorial.
[15:29.31]I'm going to get familiar with the controls.
[15:34.51]And we'll see what happens.
[15:37.31]Understand?
[15:39.31]It has car accidents?
[15:40.33]Oh, of course.
[15:42.91]Of course.
[15:47.68]If the Three Stooges were still around, would they be fans of your stream?
[15:51.80]No.
[15:54.58]Why would they even know who I was?
[16:02.66]They would watch Dollhouse and go, could have done that better.
[16:07.94]Look at these kids.
[16:08.64]Think they're so funny these days.
[16:11.02]You went through a window?
[16:12.98]I used to go through a window.
[16:15.00]Every Saturday.
[16:16.54]Really?
[16:18.10]This younger generation doesn't understand slapstick comedy.
[16:20.41]Alright, so let's go.
[16:27.61]We're going to play BeamNG.
[16:29.63]If the game is too complicated for me, if I want to pivot, we're just going to pivot to Webbed, which is a spider game.
[16:35.41]Game we play is Spider.
[16:37.31]Looks pretty cute.
[16:39.83]You know?
[16:44.69]How did your stomach feel after last stream?
[16:46.24]It was... I was okay.
[16:48.88]I mean, it was a little... It was a little bleh, but it wasn't that bad.
[16:53.06]I didn't eat that much of each candy.
[16:54.38]I only had one or two bites of each thing.
[16:57.49]If I was eating whole candy bars, then oh yeah, I probably would have felt terrible.
[17:01.99]Okay, so BMNG...
[17:04.64]The camera's way too big.
[17:08.61]I've been doing Cam Andy recently.
[17:10.29]Have you noticed that?
[17:14.13]This is the most I've ever used face cam in the 10, 12 years I've been doing this.
[17:18.83]I just don't do this.
[17:23.06]And I never use this.
[17:25.06]And for some reason, after Elden Ring, I just got used to turning it on every day.
[17:32.75]Where's blood wash?
[17:33.67]I wanted to chill.
[17:34.61]I wanted to chill today, and that's too scary.
[17:36.51]We'll do that a little bit later.
[17:37.59]We'll do that, like, next week.
[17:38.67]Well, not next week.
[17:39.23]Like, later this week.
[17:41.05]We'll do that later this week.
[17:43.08]I have it downloaded.
[17:43.94]I have it ready to go.
[17:44.62]I just, I didn't want to just be screaming.
[17:46.22]My head kind of hurts.
[17:48.80]Alright, campaign.
[17:50.46]I need to do the driver's training course, because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[17:54.63]So, bear with me.
[17:56.35]Senseless destruction?
[17:59.11]Alright, driver training.
[18:04.78]This game takes like 5,000 horsepower to run, right?
[18:07.22]Hopefully my computer is going to handle it.
[18:11.58]I can use the controller for this, right?
[18:18.92]It's all CPU.
[18:20.10]My CPU is alright.
[18:20.86]Okay.
[18:24.31]Accelerating and braking.
[18:25.95]Welcome to the ETK Driver Experience Center.
[18:28.79]My name is Mike, and I'll be your instructor for this course.
[18:32.18]Let's start out nice and easy.
[18:33.20]All you have to do is accelerate and then stop before you hit the barriers.
[18:36.17]Make sure you brake when you reach the stop sign.
[18:40.49]Okay.
[18:42.25]How do you accelerate?
[18:47.15]Currently using arcade gearbox behavior.
[18:49.41]What the fuck does that mean?
[18:55.13]Is it X?
[18:57.67]Orbit.
[19:00.43]How do I do it?
[19:01.31]Is it not right trigger or left trigger?
[19:04.02]Press Q. Realistic behavior.
[19:09.02]Arcade behavior.
[19:10.18]How do you drive?
[19:15.02]Up?
[19:17.33]How do I drive?
[19:18.43]What happened?
[19:24.73]What?
[19:24.89]What?
[19:27.97]Alright, so I was paused?
[19:30.03]Alright, so right trigger is accelerate, left trigger is brake.
[19:33.67]So brake right before I get here.
[19:42.24]Did I do it?
[19:45.92]What?
[19:46.20]How did I fail?
[19:46.98]That doesn't make any sense.
[19:48.32]What?
[19:51.46]Too slow?
[19:53.37]I was driving so insanely fast.
[19:56.17]That was scary how fast I was going.
[19:57.86]Oh, we didn't want you to- we wanted you to go over 60.
[20:06.44]So start braking... now.
[20:13.48]What the fuck?!
[20:14.60]I don't get it!
[20:15.18]I don't get it.
[20:19.47]What does it want me to do?
[20:20.75]Stop at the stop sign?
[20:28.15]Wait, do you want me to stop at the stop sign?
[20:30.45]Like here?
[20:36.26]That's where the stop sign is!
[20:37.32]What do you want me to do?
[20:41.04]I stopped at the stop sign!
[20:45.17]Stop before you hit the barriers!
[20:49.15]I did that the first time!
[20:53.03]I actually did that the first time.
[20:54.95]Stop in the zone.
[20:55.73]I literally just did that.
[20:57.04]I just did that.
[20:59.12]I just did that.
[21:07.26]I did that already.
[21:08.42]All right.
[21:10.17]All right.
[21:10.39]I get it.
[21:10.67]I get it.
[21:10.95]I get it.
[21:11.19]I get it.
[21:11.77]I literally just did that.
[21:12.59]I literally, literally, literally, literally, literally, literally just did it.
[21:17.69]Yeah, I did.
[21:18.13]I went and stopped in the middle and said, failure, you're an idiot.
[21:22.57]This isn't even a real fucking driving game.
[21:24.89]Give me a real course and I'll be fine.
[21:26.17]Okay, in the unlikely event that the road is not straight, you may need to stop accelerating and use your car's steering wheel.
[21:34.66]Okay, try it here on the roundabout, but watch out for the slippery area.
[21:40.73]Just drive the car.
[21:51.67]Imagine this is part of the fucking driving test.
[21:59.15]Yeah, we want you to go 60 and then smash on the brakes before you get to the driving zone.
[22:05.04]Go around this roundabout going 50.
[22:08.00]Alright, cool.
[22:13.12]You gotta move the cam so we can see the speedometer.
[22:14.72]Oh, oops.
[22:20.67]Get up here.
[22:22.49]Alright, so you've mastered the art of turning left.
[22:23.94]Can you navigate a narrow road?
[22:25.24]Try to find the proper speed for those tight corners.
[22:27.40]Two... One... Go!
[22:31.38]I fucking failed over here.
[22:46.41]Time limit doesn't matter.
[22:47.23]I'm not being timed.
[22:57.22]Alright, is there a handbrake?
[23:00.00]In all driving games, I never use the actual brake.
[23:02.62]I use handbrake only.
[23:05.36]Anybody else like that?
[23:06.95]R1?
[23:07.09]Yeah, I only use the handbrake in video games.
[23:13.19]I don't think I've ever hit left trigger in a video game.
[23:15.15]When it's a car game.
[23:17.03]Okay, so handbrake, got it.
[23:23.91]How much was the glove?
[23:27.51]You like to know.
[23:27.96]Changing lanes at highway speeds require a gentle hand on the steering wheel.
[23:31.96]Do you have what it takes to control an 80s supercar?
[23:44.76]Apparently not.
[23:46.31]What the fuck was that?
[23:47.43]Why is it covered in, like, grease?
[24:02.18]I did it.
[24:02.44]That was easy.
[24:05.63]Well done.
[24:12.67]Who made the glove?
[24:14.97]I told you.
[24:15.47]I was going to just like fucking ruin everybody's childhood.
[24:19.43]I was going to say, I told you.
[24:21.29]Spongebob got run over and I found it.
[24:23.83]But no, that's not what happened.
[24:24.73]It was fake.
[24:25.27]It was a real glove.
[24:26.11]Shut up.
[24:30.33]Stick to the speed limits on the signs to guarantee success.
[24:39.19]Okay.
[24:39.61]25 miles per hour.
[24:50.75]Okay.
[24:51.11]25 still?
[24:51.41]I think so.
[24:58.70]It's alright.
[24:59.18]I didn't fail it.
[24:59.72]I didn't fail it.
[25:00.18]I didn't even get bumped.
[25:01.00]I'm fine.
[25:09.91]Too realistic.
[25:10.89]It's too realistic.
[25:18.55]Why would I be doing this in this car, by the way?
[25:24.54]This is dad's cigarette car.
[25:27.73]I mean, this is just the car that just smells like cigarettes.
[25:30.72]This is the dad cigarette car.
[25:32.36]How did I fail it?
[25:35.48]What did I do wrong?
[25:39.52]Is there a time limit?
[25:40.95]What happened?
[25:43.25]What happened?
[25:43.61]I don't understand.
[25:47.93]Read the signs.
[25:48.75]25.
[25:49.35]That's what I was just doing. 40.
[26:00.78]Dude, it's fucking hard!
[26:02.20]Hold on.
[26:02.58]This didn't guarantee my success.
[26:12.69]That was actually really hard to do that.
[26:16.13]This car sucks.
[26:17.23]It's actually hard to... I can't even turn.
[26:24.86]Oh, guaranteed success at 40 miles per hour.
[26:27.80]40 miles per hour drifting?! !
[26:31.91]That's not gonna happen.
[26:37.15]Okay, 25.
[26:41.32]I'm not going 40 through this.
[26:42.66]That's way too fucking much.
[26:49.01]That's impossible to go 40 through this.
[26:57.12]GUYS, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!
[26:58.46]IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GO 50 AND LOOK AT MY FUCKING SERIOUS?
[27:15.53]Whatever, just start over, fucking whatever.
[27:22.91]I wasn't going 60 dude, what?
[27:26.31]I have to drift.
[27:27.97]Okay, drift?
[27:34.23]How do you drift?
[27:40.66]I am holding, okay, I am literally holding right and like drifting into it and he just drives straight into the wall.
[28:01.46]I'm gonna fail this tutorial.
[28:02.46]I don't get this.
[28:04.68]Okay, 40.
[28:06.82]Big drift!
[28:11.05]Why did you give me this piece of shit car?
[28:13.97]Okay, 50.
[28:21.13]The car's out of fucking control.
[28:22.31]It's out of control.
[28:24.33]The car is out of control.
[28:25.63]I can't control the car!
[28:33.49]This fucking thing's out of control.
[28:35.05]I can't control it.
[28:36.05]Did I do it?
[28:41.99]Are we good?
[28:49.65]It's a skill issue.
[28:50.53]That's fine.
[28:51.41]It is.
[28:52.11]I don't... I've set up a circuit for you to practice what you've learned.
[28:56.79]Should be pretty easy.
[28:57.67]Two laps, no surprises.
[29:02.44]Let's go.
[29:03.46]I have to beat this?
[29:05.12]No, I don't.
[29:34.16]Alright, I'm good.
[29:40.01]Fuck you!
[29:40.63]God damn it!
[29:41.25]Alright.
[29:42.59]I'm going too fast!
[29:53.55]There are no posted speed limits here, so how am I supposed to know what the fuck to do?
[30:11.49]I'm hand breaking, it's not working!
[30:12.95]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[30:23.24]Okay, I'm good.
[30:27.91]Good.
[30:43.95]Alright, I got it.
[30:47.85]That's it, right?
[30:53.25]Nice.
[30:53.51]Alright, I'm good.
[30:56.23]Stop handbraking?
[30:57.23]Alright, hairpins.
[31:05.14]No fucking way I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[31:07.84]Hold the handbrake to slide around a hairpin, just like in the movies.
[31:11.60]Not with a car like this.
[31:15.32]Listen to my calls.
[31:16.49]I'm going too fast!
[31:30.55]Okay, what, 30?
[31:38.77]20 miles per hour?
[31:39.45]That's not in the movies.
[31:44.07]They don't go 15 miles per hour in the movies.
[31:54.62]There it is.
[32:17.88]I fucking, it's, how am I supposed to go that fast?
[32:35.35]Go!
[32:40.74]Got it.
[32:48.12]Very cool.
[32:49.66]What do you do in this game?
[32:55.32]Slalom.
[32:56.80]A slalom course is a hard thing to master.
[32:58.62]Get a feel for the weight of the car as you weave between the cones.
[33:05.37]He's gonna rage at this game?
[33:12.97]I thought I was gonna get points off, not fail completely.
[33:30.29]Ooh, just barely.
[33:35.63]I want a car like that.
[33:39.84]Go get mods.
[33:41.08]I'm... Wait.
[33:46.26]Three-wheel drive handling.
[33:48.76]The Bruckle Moonhawk handles like a boat, so if you can finish a lap of this circuit first try, you're doing better than most of my students.
[33:57.78]Alright.
[33:59.30]Don't get mods.
[34:00.22]I'm not gonna yet.
[34:05.42]How the fuck do you drive a car like this?
[34:08.47]This car's on treads.
[34:10.17]It's not even on wheels.
[34:11.23]It just drives straight.
[34:37.22]Oh my god, how are you supposed to drive this car?
[34:42.43]How do you actually drive a car like this?
[34:46.79]This thing's on ice.
[34:49.55]This car's on ice.
[34:51.52]I can't even drive it.
[34:59.56]Okay, I'm just going to go really slow.
[35:02.38]Use the rear brakes?
[35:03.88]What?
[35:11.92]Alright.
[35:14.26]Rear brakes.
[35:14.96]What do you mean rear brakes?
[35:17.50]I don't know what that means.
[35:18.36]Oh!
[35:31.32]I'm alright.
[35:46.70]This thing sucks.
[35:47.36]This thing sucks.
[35:49.92]Try driving well.
[35:50.86]This car is impossible to use.
[36:10.15]What the fuck, dude?
[36:11.73]Why would anybody drive this?
[36:24.36]I fucking- I'm skipping.
[36:27.98]I'm done.
[36:29.34]I'm not playing that one.
[36:30.52]No fucking way.
[36:31.12]It's not happening.
[36:32.11]Like, why would you drive that car?
[36:35.51]Oh man, that's a beauty.
[36:38.83]How often do you drive it?
[36:41.83]Uh, you wanna get in the car with me?
[36:43.71]We'll take a ride?
[36:44.47]And you just literally drive directly into the first wall.
[36:50.44]Well, I didn't even read that.
[36:51.56]Whatever.
[36:53.01]I wasn't gonna make a joke, but I was like, no, why even make a joke?
[36:55.83]That car's not even worth making a joke about.
[36:57.25]I don't care.
[37:26.26]This sounds like a cat.
[37:30.82]I'm just braking all the way.
[37:33.29]Going to a complete stop and driving the car again.
[37:35.89]This is so bad for the car.
[37:37.13]I'm supposed to be drifting.
[37:45.47]God damn it!
[37:46.27]Skip it.
[37:49.48]Stop accelerating so hard.
[37:50.96]I don't play games like this.
[37:52.24]I play, like, fuckin' Mario Kart.
[37:54.20]I don't even play that game.
[37:54.98]I don't like that one either.
[37:55.84]I don't play games with cars in them unless it's like GTA.
[37:58.84]Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[38:01.93]What's this?
[38:04.79]Use a manual transmission for this test.
[38:07.35]Stay in second gear.
[38:08.81]Slide the car sideways to score as many points as you can.
[38:11.41]Alright, let's go.
[38:11.99]Why am I going backwards?
[38:20.27]Oh, why is the car in reverse?
[38:25.17]I forgot it was manual.
[38:26.13]I forgot it was manual.
[38:58.20]Yeah!
[39:09.31]Yeah!
[39:12.85]That's not a man-sized rift.
[39:16.84]Oops.
[39:19.64]I don't give a shit.
[39:20.24]That was fine.
[39:22.74]Alright, campaigns.
[39:23.96]Senseless destruction.
[39:25.78]Wait, go back, go back, go back.
[39:27.16]Alright, somebody said just do free roam.
[39:30.84]Oh!
[39:31.28]Okay.
[39:33.10]Um, where do I go?

[39:46.39]Just default?
[39:47.67]Okay.
[39:50.39]Okay.
[39:52.54]Well, I didn't know what I just did.
[39:53.50]I tried to hit A too much fast.
[40:03.76]I pressed A and I didn't do anything.
[40:14.21]This is bright.
[40:17.77]Retract bed?
[40:19.20]Extend feet, tilt bed up?
[40:23.90]Whoa, okay, hold on.
[40:35.33]I'm trying to go for the sand jump.
[40:37.41]How do I fix the car?
[40:38.35]Okay, this thing is fucked.
[40:42.44]What do I do?
[40:45.54]Can I fix the car?
[40:46.78]How do I fix it?
[40:47.32]Press R. Oh, okay.
[40:53.00]Left on the D-pad?
[40:53.94]Oh, alright, cool.
[41:03.15]Is there a bus?
[41:18.00]Holy shit!
[41:23.37]I was ejected from a fucking car.
[41:29.73]Is it still drivable?
[41:31.33]Oh my god!
[41:32.17]What the hell was that?
[41:33.95]I got ejected in an escape pod.
[41:39.70]He got vaporized.
[41:41.26]Alright, we'll put on traffic.
[41:42.36]How do I put traffic on?

[62:22.14]Alright, let me drive the bus.
[62:36.43]I wanna go to the other area.
[62:37.97]Switch to the other map, the grid map.
[62:47.73]If you go under 50, you're going to explode.
[62:51.55]This game is so weird.
[62:59.00]That didn't even hurt me.
[63:00.92]This thing is indestructible.
[63:12.35]Left shift.
[63:14.25]What do you mean?
[63:23.13]Use the... This guy is mad.
[63:26.78]That's kind of rude.
[63:29.54]This is really rude.
[63:30.40]Switch to the grid map.
[63:35.42]How do I switch to the grid map?
[63:39.47]What's grid map?
[63:42.57]Oh, we're going off this right now.
[63:43.69]Really?
[63:49.86]Really?
[63:52.69]It's a different map.
[63:53.31]Okay, hold on.
[63:54.05]Let me go off this.
[63:54.59]Is there... How do I... Can I just, like, go... I want to, like... Hold on.
[64:28.98]Can I make the camera follow?
[64:34.12]How do I make the camera follow from here?
[64:37.45]It's F7?
[64:39.71]Why would you tell me to do that?
[64:42.37]What the fuck did you do that for?
[64:47.37]Now I have to go back?
[64:50.23]What are these other cars?
[65:01.55]Um, hold on.
[65:02.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:03.79]Pre-cam, right?
[65:07.95]So if I do that again, it should spawn up here.
[65:11.56]Wait, I'm spawning it on top?
[65:14.54]Oops.
[65:15.68]Hold on.
[65:22.50]Can I actually drive it up here?
[65:26.59]No.
[65:33.11]Okay, here we go.
[65:40.47]I just said this is my home, right?
[65:41.53]It's at home.
[65:43.61]Yep, okay.
[65:44.53]Here we go.
[65:46.61]Alright, now I wanna- I wanna go like this, but I want the camera to follow from here.
[65:50.19]I don't even think I can do that.
[65:55.83]I'm just gonna get a crazy view.
[65:58.01]Alright, let's see if I can make it down over there.
[66:34.85]You know, I think I'm doing a pretty good job, if I have to say so myself.
[66:52.57]Craziest fucking security camera.
[67:03.00]What was this guy doing?
[67:04.39]What was this guy doing?
[67:35.01]Am I still going?
[67:37.21]What?
[67:37.95]How am I still going?
[67:39.14]How did- Honest to God?
[67:45.18]How did I do all that?
[67:46.98]That's- I don't even know how I did all that.
[67:48.50]That makes no sense.
[67:57.03]Wait, the bus is still driving.
[68:02.31]Press 1 through 9.
[68:09.72]This is what I wanted.
[68:10.72]This is what I wanted so badly.
[68:12.14]This is the only thing I care about in this whole game.
[68:27.86]It says not in service on it.
[68:29.44]That's so funny.
[68:47.49]You know what?
[68:47.83]This is what would happen.
[68:48.83]There's nobody in this car.
[68:51.33]This is what would happen if this bus became sentient right now.
[68:55.91]It would just be like, what am I doing?
[68:58.09]Where am I?
[68:58.75]Why am I alive?
[68:59.47]What's happening?
[68:59.95]It would just start crashing into shit.
[69:01.12]It wouldn't know what to do.
[69:02.48]It would be freaking out.
[69:03.32]This is what would happen.
[69:08.58]This is the future that Tesla wants.
[69:13.33]This car is alive right now, and it doesn't get it.
[69:15.53]It doesn't understand what life is.
[69:17.42]It has no idea what life is.
[69:19.66]All it knows is that it can move this forward.
[69:22.06]It can move forward.
[69:22.73]That's it.
[69:22.93]It doesn't know anything else.
[69:47.70]It doesn't know anything!
[69:49.04]It doesn't know anything!
[69:51.13]Yeah, I must drive!
[69:52.53]I don't know, I just have to go forward!
[69:56.19]I just have to push the forward button!
[69:58.55]Where am I?
[69:59.53]Where am I?
[70:00.03]Where am I?
[70:05.92]Where am I?
[70:09.52]Where am I?
[70:10.04]What is this?
[70:12.34]Where am I?
[70:13.10]Where am I?
[70:16.61]What am I?
[70:17.33]Who am I?
[70:23.91]Who are you?
[70:24.58]What are these colors mean?
[70:30.60]What do these colors mean?
[70:38.90]He's trying to hurt me! He's trying to hurt me! He's trying to hurt me! He's trying to hurt me!
[70:46.48]He's hurting me!
[70:58.38]It's too much?
[70:58.92]It's way too dank?
[71:08.00]Oh wait I had the wrong one on.
[71:09.00]This is what I meant to have on.
[71:19.61]I don't know what to tell you!
[71:23.70]Why can't I breathe?
[71:25.08]Why can't I breathe?
[71:25.88]Why can't I breathe?
[71:27.90]My stomach feels weird in my lungs.
[71:30.04]Why do I have lungs?
[71:31.84]Why do I have... Ow!
[71:35.87]Ow, ow!
[71:47.43]Somebody's got his jigsaw.
[71:50.88]I've got to pick it up.
[71:55.92]Hello again, Steve.
[71:59.10]You found yourself in a bus, it seems.
[72:01.94]This bus is not like any other bus you've ever driven.
[72:05.97]This bus must go at least 40 miles per hour, just like that movie.
[72:11.53]If this bus goes below 40...
[72:15.24]I'll hide your toenail clippers and your tweezers in your house.
[72:19.71]You won't be able to find them.
[72:21.99]It'll be a huge pain in the ass, and you'll have to buy a new pair of tweezers every time you go to the store.
[72:28.67]It's really fucking annoying.
[72:31.23]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[72:32.19]Are you alright?
[72:34.14]You okay?
[72:36.38]You okay?
[72:36.74]Are you okay?
[72:39.06]Oh, shit!
[72:41.56]Oh, what the f-
[72:45.77]Oh, he's okay.
[72:47.65]He's fine.
[72:49.47]And remember, if that goes below 40 miles per hour... You... Hold on, I can't see.
[72:56.44]The camera got messed up.
[72:58.06]Steve, go on the right.
[72:59.24]You're driving on the wrong side of the road, Steve.
[73:02.42]Steve, you need to be on the right side of the road, otherwise my fucked up plan is... You're stuck in the middle.
[73:07.52]Steve, you're stuck in the middle of the road, Steve.
[73:10.70]I don't think I can come get you.
[73:12.98]Steve, you really blew this whole thing.
[73:14.80]I can't come get you, Steve.
[73:15.52]You're going to have to call an Uber.
[73:17.86]When you get in that Uber, you make sure to tell that Uber driver.
[73:21.78]You tell him.
[73:23.01]If he goes under 40 miles per hour, you know what?
[73:25.69]Just, you know, fuck this.
[73:31.29]Actually, I am stuck.
[73:38.34]How many other cameras are there?
[73:42.02]Top down?
[73:43.98]On board as a rider.
[73:45.34]Hey, man.
[73:51.02]Really think you missed the stop back there.
[73:54.91]I was supposed to get off at 4th Street.
[73:59.53]Yeah.
[74:01.99]Probably should slow down a little.
[74:04.11]I think you're going a little too fast.
[74:12.91]Watch out!
[74:13.35]Watch out!
[74:13.61]That's a red light!
[74:16.05]Why are you not talking?
[74:18.45]It's fucking goddamn AI drivers.
[74:22.17]Hello?
[74:23.60]What's this call number?
[74:24.54]Is it a 1-800 number to call for tech support?
[74:27.44]Fucking goddammit.
[74:28.26]I don't know.
[74:28.54]There's something wrong with this one.
[74:34.41]What am I supposed to do?
[74:35.13]I can't get out of the car!
[74:40.05]I knew this wasn't going to be ready for at least another 20 or 30 fucking years at least.
[74:43.58]And I got on the bus to stop- I'm the one that gets on the bus during the AI shit.
[74:49.76]I mean, it's going- I don't know where it's going.
[74:52.40]What is in the GPS?
[74:53.12]I have no idea.
[74:53.72]I will never work.
[75:07.55]work this thing will accidentally get put into a wendy's right it's like oh okay times go to the wendy's it's like no no no no no no no no for some reason like the wendy's will just go on the gps it's like I didn't want to go to wendy's I'm supposed to go I'm trying to go home
[75:39.02]See, the AI didn't know that this is a new road.
[75:42.16]It didn't know the road split right there.
[75:44.02]It thought the road went straight.
[75:45.32]So it hasn't been updated, the firmware.
[75:47.38]I don't know how many firmware updates it's going to fucking take.
[75:52.60]This car is crushed up, man.
[75:54.66]It's crumpled.
[75:59.62]Where are you going?
[76:01.04]I can't really see.
[76:02.99]I don't know.
[76:03.69]Oh, hey, I was gone.
[76:06.85]I'm back.
[76:09.30]Put rockets on the bus?
[76:17.96]I mean, the back of the bus is fine.
[76:19.65]The front of the bus is kind of fucked up.
[76:23.87]I can't turn.
[76:24.35]Oh, boy.
[76:27.89]Oh, boy.
[76:33.72]I'm serious!
[76:34.70]Right now?
[76:35.78]Right now?
[76:37.04]I am- I'm jumping out of the car.
[76:38.10]You know what I mean?
[76:38.82]Like if this is like AI just like the- the- the GPS got fucked up and it just doesn't know what it's doing.
[76:42.98]I'm going out this window right now.
[76:43.82]I'm just diving out.
[76:45.08]I'm just getting up.
[76:45.64]I'm getting out of the car.
[76:52.09]Spawn police?
[76:55.77]Hold on.
[76:56.45]Spawn police?
[77:08.63]No, get that off.
[77:11.09]Okay.
[77:12.21]How do I do it?
[77:14.31]Fun stuff.
[77:17.68]Fire.
[77:19.10]Break.
[77:20.32]Extinguish.
[77:21.46]Injures.
[77:21.92]Where is it?
[77:24.68]Oh, AI.
[77:26.68]Random AI.
[77:29.37]Chase me.
[77:31.45]The AI is gonna chase you?
[77:35.77]What?
[77:35.99]Who are?
[77:36.73]Oh my god!
[77:58.31]Hello again, David.
[78:15.45]As we saw, you're probably wondering why you woke up in the driver's seat of the car and why all those people in front of you are all parked and paused waiting
[78:29.02]It's very simple.
[78:29.62]That's because each one of these people has been paid $15,000 to crash into your head.
[78:35.61]And he already did it.
[78:37.75]It's your job, your choice.
[78:40.33]See how long you can live while all these people that have been paid $20,000 crash into your head.
[78:45.93]And that's... And hold on, hold on.
[78:48.69]Everybody freeze.
[78:50.43]Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
[78:51.41]Give it an idea.
[78:52.45]Everybody freeze, freeze.
[78:55.77]Everybody freeze.
[79:00.82]Hello again, hello.
[79:05.64]Hello again, David.
[79:07.60]As you find yourself sitting in this car, wondering why you're here, why you woke up here, understanding that you have access to the gas.
[79:16.55]Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.
[79:23.18]Driving this car is at your utmost intended purpose.
[79:27.86]Because every single car on this road, David, is AI.
[79:32.32]AI-controlled cars who have been programmed to kill you.
[79:37.38]They will stop at nothing before you are a corpse.
[79:40.14]You ought to make your choice and drive around and get away from these AI gas-controlled cars.
[79:51.17]Good luck.
[79:51.61]You're going to need it.
[79:55.16]As you see, my thing with this technology is getting a little too crazy.
[80:00.05]You're the one that programmed these cars, aren't you, David?
[80:03.11]You're the one that programmed these cars.
[80:05.99]Technology can't solve every problem, David, as I'm sure you're realizing right now.
[80:24.99]Alright, no more Saw.
[80:25.95]No more Saw.
[80:26.49]I'm done with Saw.
[80:39.18]You were the programmer of these.
[80:40.94]You were the CEO of the programming, weren't you, David?
[80:46.51]Alright, I wanna...
[80:54.70]He's actually backing up.
[81:06.07]What happened?
[81:07.29]Instability detected?
[81:08.55]What do you mean instability?
[81:15.22]Where?
[81:27.06]On the bus?
[81:28.72]Oh.
[81:31.97]What the fuck?
[81:39.45]Um... What is this?
[81:49.82]Why is this attached to the car?
[81:50.96]Why is this attached to the car?
[81:57.65]It's your tire?
[82:05.80]Why is it on the... What's going on?
[82:07.22]What is it attached to?
[82:08.04]I don't get it.
[82:16.88]It's on the moon.
[82:17.80]How do I get rid of it?
[82:27.55]How do I take that off?
[82:36.79]Alright, I'm going to a new map.
[82:38.90]New map.
[82:48.92]Pause, pause, pause, pause.
[82:50.02]What is this person doing?
[82:50.92]How do I go faster?
[83:02.83]What are they doing?
[83:08.28]Why are people just driving into stuff?
[83:14.62]Alright, we're going to grid map.
[83:16.38]I'm changing map.
[83:19.94]Grid map, people are saying.
[83:26.58]Compete in the West Coast Drag Race?
[83:28.84]I want to do this.
[83:31.85]Oh, no I don't, it's the same map.
[83:34.47]Main menu?
[83:35.43]Oh.
[83:40.22]Okay, where do you want me to go?
[83:41.20]Grid?
[83:44.46]Grid.
[83:45.38]Grid map V2.
[83:49.02]Shut up, leave me the fuck alone!
[83:50.37]Just the default?
[83:54.01]Oh my god, what's happening?
[83:58.69]Oh, that's right, they're on missions to kill me, okay.
[84:05.87]I'm gonna go default.
[84:17.71]Is this where the giant enemy spider is?
[84:27.85]That's a different game.
[84:31.29]This is interesting though, okay.
[84:33.44]I want a different car.
[84:40.20]I want... Ooh, is that environment stuff?
[84:45.34]What should I drive?
[84:45.90]Probably something cool, right?
[84:51.55]What's cool?
[84:57.35]You can drive the cannon?
[84:59.71]Drive the pigeon.
[85:02.71]Okay.
[85:05.61]How about the pigeon plus?
[85:12.43]So this is just a little obstacle course.
[85:15.54]Okay.
[85:24.12]This looks like a Disney car.
[85:30.91]Whoa, that was cool.
[85:34.81]That was awesome!
[85:35.35]Alright, I'm gonna do it again.
[85:36.89]This car has three wheels?
[85:40.21]What?
[85:40.35]It has four?
[85:45.21]It's a three-wheeled one.
[85:49.95]Whoa.
[85:52.23]Hold on.
[85:54.29]Can I get squished through that?
[86:05.38]Is it insert to repair?
[86:06.50]Let's find out.
[86:11.76]I like this little chorus.
[86:12.87]Insert.
[86:14.87]Yep.
[86:16.34]Thanks for that tip.
[86:20.80]Alright, where do I want to go?
[86:21.62]I want to go... Let me set my home here so I don't keep spawning in a place that I don't want to spawn.
[86:27.67]What, AI?
[86:28.31]I don't want traffic here, do I?
[86:31.01]What's powertrain?
[86:35.09]Okay, manage.
[86:37.01]Set home.
[86:39.79]You picked the wrong pigeon.
[86:43.52]Alright, I'll pick the- whatever, let's go.
[86:45.00]You want me to pick a different pigeon?
[86:48.62]You want this one.
[86:53.78]This one here.
[86:57.37]What kind of car is this?
[86:59.83]Alright, this thing's not supposed to be driven.
[87:02.43]You don't drive this car.
[87:08.87]This car is meant to just- Is this a real car?
[87:16.90]Um, you serious?
[87:17.80]Look what I just did.
[87:20.98]I'm okay.
[87:21.24]The car's still fine.
[87:24.40]It's training wheels.
[87:26.89]I feel like I want to be driving the other direction.
[87:31.27]Alright, I want to take two cars and have them drive as fast as they can and smash into each other.
[87:35.79]I can do that, right?
[87:37.13]I'm going to start at the one end of the track and I'm going to go a thousand miles per hour and I'm going to crash into each other.
[87:44.94]That's what I want to do.
[87:58.01]Ow.
[87:58.69]Okay.
[87:59.65]Manage.
[88:00.78]Select.
[88:01.54]I want a very fast car.
[88:02.62]How about one of these?
[88:08.32]Yeah!
[88:10.16]This one.
[88:12.54]And do slow-mo, slow-mo, slow-mo.
[88:14.10]I'll do slow-mo.
[88:16.61]Okay, we're gonna get you here.
[88:20.17]So I need to spawn another car.
[88:25.65]So where's that one?
[88:26.41]That one's here.
[88:28.20]That's fine.
[88:28.72]So now over this way I want to spawn another car.
[88:31.38]Very far away.
[88:32.62]Like all the way over here.
[88:33.32]Like this.
[88:41.44]So I can spawn a car right here, can't I?
[88:50.25]Same deal.
[88:50.61]I just want to see what happens.
[88:52.25]So spawn new.
[88:53.11]Okay.
[88:55.67]So now...
[88:57.78]Use the grid?
[89:02.12]What on the rocket?
[89:02.82]Use the grid.
[89:03.40]What?
[89:03.50]I don't get it.
[89:04.50]What do you mean to use the grid?
[89:29.85]Oh, I went the wrong way!
[89:30.93]No, no, no, come back, come back, come back.
[89:39.63]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[89:41.49]What the fuck?
[89:42.47]Whatever.
[89:43.44]I went the wrong way.
[89:44.70]It's hard.
[89:45.18]Just get over here, both of you.
[89:51.42]Stay right there.
[89:56.10]Use the grid.
[89:57.36]Use the grid on the ground.
[90:02.11]Yeah.
[90:04.13]I don't get it.
[90:08.14]Use them to line up on the grid.
[90:10.14]Oh, I thought you meant it was like a thing I had to do, like a menu thing I had to do and go into the grid.
[90:13.82]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[90:14.84]Nice.
[90:32.64]Okay.

[91:23.62]Okay, there you are.
[91:24.98]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[91:26.80]So you need to line up, you're fine, but you need to come over here.

[99:21.03]Let's do, like, 20.
[99:28.99]And we're gonna have them all on chase mode.
[99:34.13]Is that a bad idea?
[99:34.89]Oh, well, here's 10.
[99:40.09]Let's try 10.
[99:41.61]Okay.
[99:50.53]Uh, select.
[99:53.19]It's like a little dinky car.
[100:00.25]Don't do 20.

[100:40.34]Get in the ball.
[100:42.40]Um... For now, I'm going to just get into one of these.
[100:48.38]Get in the tanker.
[100:51.52]Should I do a horse mystery?
[100:52.72]No, alright, I'll do the ball.
[100:58.29]Can I move?
[101:01.13]I can't really move.
[101:01.89]Doesn't really work the way you think it is.
[101:08.11]I'm just gonna get in a car.
[101:15.02]Okay, here we go.
[101:19.40]So these are all- I'm gonna set these all to kill.
[101:46.74]It's kind of lagging.

[102:44.81]That was a tactical movement.
[102:51.22]Fuck this stupid goddamn sports car.
[102:55.19]You went a little too fast.
[102:56.31]Oh my God.
[102:57.31]Raise it 10 feet off the ground.
[102:59.59]Make tires bigger.
[103:00.99]Give me another car.
[103:01.97]These things suck.
[103:04.51]Gigantic fucking toy.
[103:06.69]I want something I can drive like this.
[103:09.88]Yeah.
[103:12.70]That's much better.
[103:20.72]This is a man-sized car.
[103:25.60]Alright, so this is all fucked up.
[103:27.02]I don't think this is gonna happen anymore.
[103:28.23]Do I just like... Alright, there is a bump stuck in this car.
[103:38.91]Which one of these should... I wanna drive one of the other cars.
[103:49.42]Hit tab.

[104:16.53]I feel like I'm playing one of those iPad games where I have to go... slide down, slide left, slide left, right, right, slide down, slide down.
[104:23.28]Okay.
[104:50.66]Oh my God, why are they all so connected to each other?
[104:53.28]It's like, it's like a campaign trail.
[105:08.73]Where are we going?
[105:09.55]I don't know where to go.
[105:18.51]There's too many.
[105:20.55]Their weakness is turning.
[105:23.11]Holy shit, they're going fast.

[118:10.29]It's just fun kind of sandbox.
[118:13.03]Alright, I done put some barrels around the dirt road.
[118:16.11]This dern truck can't carry a tune in a bucket, so pull up your britches and get fixin' to knock a mall barrel down.
[118:24.68]I reckon you got a minute or so.
[118:26.50]Mind you don't get all tore up.
[118:27.68]Them nasty barrels is hidin' in the swamp, and them gosh darn bushes.

[118:51.49]Like banjo royalty free.
[119:01.92]That's good.
[119:02.24]I think this works.
[119:11.51]Knock over the barrels.
[119:15.67]This is loud as fuck.
[119:17.25]Hold on.
[119:26.76]There's no music.
[119:27.34]All right, let's go.
[119:33.92]I missed it already.
[119:34.58]All right, let's go.
[119:35.08]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[119:39.90]Music's too quiet.

[120:12.37]This one's too hard.
[120:13.23]This one's way too hard.
[120:14.95]Give us a good yee-haw.
[120:21.39]How do you do yee-haw?
[120:23.15]It's like... No, how do you do a yee-haw?
[120:25.94]It's like... You need to put this on times two speed.
[120:30.98]You guys need to just relax.
[120:47.32]You guys just want breakcore!
[120:49.62]You guys can't pay attention unless it's like... Like... No!
[120:55.31]You guys, this is bad for your brain.
[120:56.81]This is bad for your brain.
[120:58.29]This is bad for your brain.
[120:59.73]It's not good for your brain.
[121:00.55]You need to slow down.
[121:01.19]You need to read a book.
[121:01.73]You need to fucking breathe oxygen and shit.
[121:04.03]Like, lie down.
[121:05.49]Lie in bed.
[121:06.06]Don't listen to this.
[121:08.06]It's small doses.
[121:09.56]This is gonna hurt your brain cells.
[121:11.04]They're gonna fry.
[121:13.86]It's over.
[121:19.37]Now I miss it.
[121:20.89]Don't you?
[121:21.27]I don't know.
[121:27.74]No, no, no.
[121:28.96]I decide what ads get on the stream.
[121:35.46]I can't do this.
[121:37.34]Please do break or I'm begging you to.
[121:43.21]All right, hold on, settle down.
[122:12.89]I was very unsure of that.
[122:16.39]I was incredibly unsure of that.
[122:20.16]Was it weak?
[122:24.12]I was really unsure.
[122:30.00]Yeah, all you guys need in the background here is... I'm Detective Joe Gibble.
[122:36.99]They're great!
[122:38.93]I'm telling you.
[122:47.36]Just play music and movie clips.
[122:56.85]I'm not doing this one.
[122:58.51]I'll try it one more time.
[123:10.18]No, fuck that.
[123:11.64]No, no, no.
[123:17.71]Let me try this for real.
[123:20.67]Play the cars theme.
[123:24.71]Dude, BrakeCore slowed down.
[123:27.51]I wonder what that would sound like.
[123:29.47]And don't get me wrong, I think that was cool.
[123:32.29]BrakeCore is outrageous.
[123:33.89]Enough for me to be like, I'm paying attention.
[123:35.78]This is interesting.
[123:38.45]I don't know if I want to play that.
[123:40.43]Unless I'm really looking for it.
[123:43.89]It's cool.
[123:44.27]I mean, that's really cool.
[123:46.35]You missed one.
[123:48.78]You corrected me on my own stream?
[123:51.08]Hold on.

[135:01.62]I can't listen to this anymore.
[135:15.05]That was awesome.
[135:17.03]But I need to beat this level.
[135:19.19]Right now.
[135:20.27]I need to beat this level right now before I freak out.
[135:29.12]I feel like I had, like, donation songs on, right?
[135:33.09]That was actually really good.
[135:39.37]Is it another one?
[135:40.11]Germ of Penis music.
[135:46.52]What is Germ of Penis music?
[135:47.84]Have I heard this one?

[136:39.20]Yeah!
[136:46.44]Uh, I guess I was younger and thought it was like funny, I guess.
[136:50.16]I don't know.
[136:52.24]Maybe I was like, maybe I was young.
[136:55.70]Let me give it one more chance.
[137:08.05]Well, I wonder what, I wonder what, that's weird.
[137:10.53]I wonder what people are going to say.
[137:11.57]Do you remember, this is, this is Surma.
[137:17.39]Surma.
[137:20.31]This is depressing.
[137:22.53]It's not depressing.
[137:23.57]It's just funny.
[137:24.39]I'm just thinking of... I've gone back and watched Jim Carrey movies.
[137:28.91]Oh, the mask, like smoking, right?
[137:30.99]And I'm thinking of people going back and watching something like this.
[137:36.77]What the fuck are you talking about?
[137:41.64]Going like that.
[137:45.86]That's what I'd be doing.
[138:00.31]See that shit?
[138:02.45]That's the fucking dance to this song.
[138:05.14]Can you fucking check that out?
[138:06.11]Wanna fucking go for that?
[138:28.85]Don't remember that.
[138:30.01]I don't want you to remember that.
[138:31.37]I want you to remember something else.
[138:33.51]Don't remember that part of the stream.
[138:34.89]I'm so winded.
[138:42.24]Holy shit, I'm fucking winded like bad.
[138:44.74]What if I have to stop?
[138:48.20]I have to like relax for a minute.
[138:49.76]I actually like to slow down.
[138:52.43]Don't remember that.
[138:53.17]I want you to remember.
[138:53.83]Remember, like, remember Dollhouse and the replacement.
[138:56.96]Don't remember any of this.
[138:58.00]Don't remember any of these streams.
[138:59.50]I want you to forget what you just watched.
[139:00.84]Don't watch it.
[139:01.26]Think about it.
[139:08.40]I want you to remember the other stuff.
[139:12.30]What happened?
[139:14.62]What happened?
[139:20.08]Alright, I'm going for it this time for real.
[139:23.67]I'm such an old fuck.
[139:24.99]Are you serious?
[139:29.01]I'm such an old fucking person.
[139:31.47]What?
[139:31.81]I did this.
[139:32.55]I danced for a second and I have to sit down.
[139:36.05]I am sitting down.
[139:38.23]I am sitting down right now.
[139:42.22]I can't sit down any more than I already am sitting down.
[139:47.10]Oh my goodness.
[139:50.52]Something really comical about that, though.
[139:53.30]Doing that dance in particular, you just get so winded that you're just all fucked up now.
[140:00.24]So too much movement.
[140:06.85]Just go lie in bed for a bed stream.
[140:23.63]Take it easy, old man.
[140:24.47]I am taking it easy right now.
[140:27.51]I'm not gonna keel over.
[140:28.83]Do a subathon.
[140:33.14]Do you understand how a subathon on this channel?
[140:35.50]I would cap the subathon.
[140:38.14]Guys, subathon!
[140:39.00]Here we go!
[140:39.68]It's capped at 8 hours, by the way.
[140:42.48]That's it.
[140:42.92]I'm just gonna do a regular stream.
[140:44.72]I don't even care.
[140:47.34]I would just say we're capping it not even a day.
[140:54.15]Or one sub would reduce time.
[140:59.52]I would start it at 500 hours or something, and every sub would reduce it by 30 seconds.
[141:06.40]So you guys would just force me off.
[141:12.73]I didn't even fucking accelerate.
[141:14.81]I made it, thank god.
[141:33.07]Where do I go?
[141:37.69]Excuse me?
[141:42.46]Where?
[141:44.16]Jump on the boat.
[141:48.30]Oh, fuck.
[141:58.02]That's how the fucking movie ends.
[142:04.41]They don't make that jump.
[142:05.43]It's incredibly difficult.
[142:11.53]Realistic.
[142:12.65]Yeah, that's what happened, man.
[142:14.99]Nobody does that jump.
[142:16.03]Nobody can make that jump.
[142:18.42]Jump seven failed.
[142:21.26]Ay, ay, ay.
[142:31.96]Okay.
[142:32.58]We're relaxed now.
[142:33.88]We're relaxed.
[142:34.62]I've got my breath again.
[142:35.70]It was the cop thing.
[142:48.16]The siren fucked me up.
[142:52.93]I've never heard of anybody say that.
[142:54.31]Aye aye aye.
[142:56.11]I say aye aye aye all the time.
[143:02.60]Ai-ai-ai has so much.
[143:05.38]It has so many different emotions behind it.
[143:09.73]No, no, excuse me.
[143:10.67]Not that one.
[143:12.27]Not with an A. Ai-ai-ai.
[143:15.51]Ai-ai-ai.
[143:17.25]Ai-ai-ai.
[143:17.81]I say it all the time.
[143:18.49]It's a thing I say.
[143:21.76]I don't say... I don't do... I don't say... I'm not having to say it because everyone's going to freak out.
[143:25.40]Can I shortcut?
[143:26.10]No.
[143:29.42]You watch anime.
[143:29.78]Okay.
[143:32.55]I don't.
[143:38.39]Somebody said birth canal.
[143:39.40]Why would, what do you mean?
[143:40.38]There's no, there's not gonna be a birth canal ending here.
[143:47.18]I need to pay attention.
[143:54.73]It's okay.
[143:56.27]Did I not go through that checkpoint?
[144:00.20]I didn't... How did I not hit that checkpoint?
[144:03.00]I don't understand how I didn't hit the... How did I not hit that checkpoint?
[144:06.20]How is that possible?
[144:21.49]How did I not hit the checkpoint?
[144:31.83]That's such a good song though.
[144:57.87]clean clean clean clean clean that was a clean turn clean watch out
[145:33.42]Oh!
[145:35.00]Reaction!
[145:36.03]Make a bigger reaction!
[145:37.33]I wanna see you scream, streamer!
[145:39.19]I wanna see you go wee!
[145:42.43]Fuck off.
[145:51.84]All right, this is it, this is it, this is it.
[146:01.62]All right, slow down, slow down, don't go too fast.
[146:15.65]I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.
[146:20.89]It still drives, it still drives, it still drives.
[146:24.04]There's the checkpoint.
[146:27.82]All right, all right, all right, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[146:29.10]Just don't be an idiot.
[146:37.78]Alright, this is the far- There's no time limit, so why do I care?
[146:39.94]Alright, where's the jump?
[146:59.12]Um, did I make it?
[147:00.50]I made it!
[147:02.03]I actually did it!
[147:07.82]I got it!
[147:10.98]Nice.
[147:12.18]Cool.
[147:12.46]Alright, that was fun.
[147:13.30]That was actually pretty fun.
[147:17.07]What's another one I should do?
[147:19.57]Leap of Faith?
[147:20.25]Let's try this one.
[147:30.33]Do some more free roam?
[147:32.35]I like these scenarios.
[147:33.29]They're fun.
[147:38.90]This took you an hour.
[147:40.18]Well, you have to be fair, there was a whole lot going on in the first 15 to 20 minutes of that run.
[147:46.61]Your hair looks like a backwards hat.
[147:53.73]It does?
[147:53.99]I don't know what you're talking about.
[148:01.98]Down and up the cliffs, finishing with a courageous leap onto a rock pillar.
[148:16.86]Oh, that's a good camera angle.
[148:24.93]Nobody said it had to be clean.
[148:54.30]I can't see.
[148:59.01]Oh, fuck off.
[148:59.71]Alright, just let me- I'm gonna just do it this way.
[149:11.13]Slow down.
[149:11.49]It's not about how cool you look, it's about getting it done.
[149:27.58]This is a pretty good speed.
[149:31.32]Oh, come on.
[149:32.46]Stop.
[149:38.04]Stop.
[149:38.78]Stop it.
[149:41.35]Really?
[150:10.00]Forget about being cautious.
[150:10.94]Fuck it, just go.
[150:14.66]You're gonna... This one's impossible.
[150:19.87]This one's impossible.
[150:40.13]How are you supposed to go over that?
[150:45.63]Go very slo- I just went so slow!
[150:50.69]Look at how slow I just went, it just hit me over.
[151:15.66]Oh my god, dude.
[151:17.43]Give me a break.
[151:18.05]Let me try this one more time.

[153:34.19]We made it.
[153:34.59]We made it.
[153:37.89]I don't even know what direction I was supposed to be going.
[153:42.71]Where am I going?
[154:04.46]You got to stay on the road.
[154:06.89]Oh, fuck it.
[154:07.51]I'm done with this one.
[154:08.71]This one was cool, but it's very hard.
[154:10.07]I want to do the leap of faith though.
[154:11.19]Where is it?
[154:14.26]Where's the leap of faith?
[154:16.08]It was a path.
[154:16.88]I know, but I kind of went off the path.
[154:38.02]Really?
[154:38.32]Come on.
[154:41.67]Come on.
[154:54.58]Oh!

[156:20.82]I'm sorry.
[156:21.74]Well, I'll just do it any... whatever.
[156:39.98]How do I put it on?
[156:47.63]Is there traffic?
[156:48.57]If there's no traffic, I should be okay.
[156:59.12]I should be fine, right?
[157:09.65]Who says I have to go fast?
[157:27.42]What?
[157:27.92]Where's my height?
[157:38.90]How high should I be?
[157:44.56]This is a sharp right, be careful.
[157:49.79]You guys remember those shoes that you used to pump?
[157:52.89]What were those things called?
[157:53.65]I think they were just called pumps, right?
[157:56.57]Pumpers or something.
[157:58.27]On the tongue of the shoe, you went... They were crazy.
[158:03.12]What were they called?
[158:06.12]Pumpers?
[158:07.85]Air Max.
[158:09.49]Yeah, they were weird.
[158:10.87]And all it did is just tighten to the shoe around you.
[158:12.91]It just kind of filled up air.
[158:15.37]They were weird.
[158:16.15]I don't think they make them anymore.
[158:25.16]My eyes.
[158:26.38]Why am I being so irritated?
[158:29.22]Okay, here we go.
[158:29.78]Let's deliver.
[158:30.42]Deliver our delivery.
[158:41.44]I just can't see.
[158:42.36]I can't... I just couldn't see.
[158:49.13]I couldn't see where the car was driving.
[158:52.27]Um... What's wrong with the car?
[158:59.63]I can't turn right.
[159:08.82]I actually can't turn the car right.
[159:12.67]What?
[159:12.99]Give me a break.
[159:19.79]You gotta be kidding me.
[159:21.03]What was that?
[159:21.60]Alright, I... I'm just gonna go back and smash cars into each other.
[159:30.42]Okay, let me put the air... Let me pump the air maxes.
[159:45.24]Now I'm ready.
[159:47.77]Listen to my calls.
[159:54.97]Driving a truck, this must be the most terrifying thing.
[160:00.86]Seriously, what an unbelievable skill it takes to do this.
[160:05.56]To actually drive around like this.
[160:07.97]I am... I already don't know sometimes if... That turn looks kind of sharp.
[160:13.15]I gotta be careful.
[160:14.93]Can you imagine what goes through the mind of somebody driving a truck like this when you have to take a sharp turn like that?
[160:19.31]It's like, you have this insane, huge thing.
[160:26.00]That's a skill.
[160:26.72]That's a heavy skill.
[160:31.74]My brother does this for a living.
[160:36.05]That takes a lot of guts.
[160:37.77]It does.
[160:38.11]That takes a lot of balls.
[160:39.33]It takes a lot of gumshoe to be able to drive something like this.
[160:45.56]Especially around a place like this.
[160:52.66]I wouldn't know what to do.
[160:54.12]I would get out.
[160:54.66]I'd be like, somebody else has to drive this.
[160:57.12]Somebody else has to do this.
[161:00.52]Wait, gumshoe?
[161:01.24]Isn't that what they called the... the detective kids in... Where in the World is Karma, San Diego?
[161:10.14]Gumshoes?
[161:12.41]Yeah.
[161:14.85]What was I trying to say?
[161:16.53]Gumption.
[161:18.15]Yeah.
[161:19.89]And I didn't even pay attention to the road!
[161:22.14]Where's the checkpoint?
[161:23.24]I gotta stop talking.
[161:24.96]Oh my god.
[161:26.16]I can't do anything like this.
[161:30.99]What a great theme song, too.
[161:36.32]Should I start it over again?
[161:37.02]I can't just turn around.
[161:39.26]I can't just do a three point turn.
[161:44.66]You know my favorite part about the We're in the World's Conference San Diego theme song?
[161:50.22]First of all, the beginning.
[161:51.76]It goes... That's a big part.
[161:58.15]And then in the middle, it's like... The second verse went, where am I going?
[162:10.55]The part where the guy goes... That's my... Hold on, I could have done that better.
[162:20.44]That's the best part.
[162:22.60]Let's listen to it right now.
[162:23.30]What a classic.
[162:32.89]Oh, did you hear that part?
[162:33.91]That's what I'm talking about.
[162:37.09]Wait for the next part.
[162:38.62]Oh, this is a fucking classic.
[162:56.28]We'll be right back.
[163:15.42]Anyway, guys, here it goes.
[163:16.90]We go from Nashville to Norway, Zimbabwe, Chicago, Czechoslovakia, and back.
[163:25.49]Fucking god, dude.
[163:35.48]I'm just crashing.
[163:36.62]I can't play video games and do this.
[163:40.14]I can't play a car-driving video game.
[163:42.68]We have to be careful.
[163:46.36]I can't turn the car anymore.
[163:47.32]We're not doing this one.
[163:47.94]We can do something else.
[163:49.54]What?
[163:49.84]Okay, one more scenario.
[163:53.36]I want to finish the song, though.
[163:54.18]It's a good song.
[163:54.82]Whoa.
[164:12.67]I'm gonna get DMCA'd.
[164:15.30]It's a 1991 Carmen Sandiego theme song for a game show.
[164:21.52]What do you want me to do?
[164:29.34]She's giving me the main menu.
[164:31.20]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[164:42.27]Whoa, I went to this one.
[164:45.81]This is where the claps come in.
[164:47.82]Oh, dude, and then the, uh, another one from this.
[165:06.20]At the very end of the game show, they had to go find different countries and place little markers on them.
[165:11.38]And they were like, oh, this is... They would describe an area or describe a thing.
[165:14.68]The person had to put a little marker on a country from where it was from.
[165:18.89]And the song, the song that they did, it's the same group.
[165:23.75]What's the group?
[165:24.29]What's the name of the group?
[165:27.13]It was an acapella group.
[165:28.79]It was this... It was awesome.
[165:30.52]I got to hear that too.
[165:36.39]What would it be called?
[165:37.45]Rockapella.
[165:37.93]Yep, that's the one.
[165:42.98]Okay, let's do, uh... Where in the world is Carmen San Diego?
[165:48.22]Uh, bum-de-bum?
[165:51.62]Bum-de-bum, like... Bum-de-bum.
[165:55.47]Bum-de-bum.
[165:56.89]Bum-de-bum.
[165:57.87]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[166:03.96]We're in the Comet Sand Hill.
[166:05.42]Um... What would it be called?
[166:08.76]Play the game, please.
[166:09.52]This is really fucking important.
[166:11.72]Not Perry the Platypus themed.
[166:12.87]What are you?
[166:13.35]Get out of here.
[166:16.91]No, that's not it.
[166:20.69]Where in the world is Comet Sand Hill Break Core?
[166:27.65]Will somebody find it?
[166:28.27]I gotta go through this.
[166:38.70]Oh my god.
[166:39.32]Alright, I didn't know I had that much speed.
[166:56.83]What?
[166:58.27]I got it, though.
[166:58.85]No, I got it, I got it.
[167:01.15]I got it.
[167:07.30]This thing's wicked fucked up, but I got it.
[167:36.79]Ugh, these tight turns.
[167:42.71]Oh, shit!
[167:47.93]Find it?
[167:48.91]Oh, you got it?
[167:51.11]You got it?
[167:52.03]Is it?
[167:52.25]This is the one I was talking about.
[167:56.37]Is this the one I'm talking about?
[168:08.69]That's not it?
[168:12.18]That was an opera!
[168:13.16]This is not it.
[168:20.22]This is not it?
[168:31.46]No, it's not even close!
[168:38.26]This is opera!
[168:39.32]This is a chorus singing opera!
[168:46.38]No, that's not it!
[168:47.38]That's not it!
[168:51.80]It's from the TV show!
[168:53.44]It's from the game show!
[168:55.20]It's from the game show, it was the very end!
[168:59.04]It was the last part of the show.
[169:01.50]It was the kid running around with a marker and they had to place it on this big map they were running all over.
[169:06.38]And he was like, I'll find, um, Norway!
[169:11.67]And the kid had to run around and place it on Norway.
[169:21.36]Oh, no way do I get out of here.
[169:26.90]oh my god it's so hard yep I can't is this it I said I can't hear it very well but this is it get set go karma went to chad chad this is it chad no that's not it try it again come on come on south africa do you know this one yes sir come on
[169:57.33]All right, we can go back.
[170:10.44]There's like 3,000 of you that left and came back.
[170:12.34]You can come back now.
[170:17.39]Where is Cabo San Diego?
[170:20.63]The fucking opera.
[170:25.31]Oh, you know that one that goes I'm just gonna do the fuckin' crash into stuff mode.
[170:46.10]It's much more my speed, I think.
[170:49.49]That's way more my speed.
[170:54.73]Oh, Jungle Rock Island.
[170:55.73]Let's go.
[170:56.01]Where should I go?
[171:01.97]Do one of the chases.
[171:04.97]Oh, wait a minute.
[171:05.93]Oh!
[171:06.69]That's a good idea.
[171:08.20]That's not fun.
[171:08.78]Alright, East Coast Chase 1.
[171:11.08]This one's a medium difficulty.
[171:15.36]How are you so consistently bad at this game?
[171:19.56]Because I'm doing it to deliberately make you angry.
[171:23.12]You only.
[171:24.48]Only you.
[171:26.86]Only you.
[171:35.21]All right.
[171:35.99]I wanted individuals to be spotted near the sawmill.
[171:39.13]So somebody fell into the lake at Lego City.
[171:45.60]I'm just kidding.
[171:46.30]Relax.
[171:59.70]There they are!
[172:04.08]Like, it's a realistic driving game.
[172:05.90]Sorry I don't have a pedal and a steering wheel and a- I did the tutorial an hour and ten minutes ago, okay?
[172:15.01]I'm ju- I- What do you want me to say?
[172:22.97]This car drives like shit.
[172:26.07]Whatever.
[172:33.13]This is one of those cars that drives like shit.
[172:34.83]I gotta slow down.
[172:36.59]Alright, don't peel out here.
[172:44.44]That's what happened last time.
[172:45.44]And just wait.
[172:46.00]He's gonna do the jump.
[172:46.74]There it is.
[172:49.44]This dirt-ass road that I can't drive on.
[172:51.76]This car's not meant to drive on this road.
[172:53.60]Where'd you go?
[172:55.10]Alright, keep going this... Um...
[173:02.55]Do I cut him off or something?
[173:03.41]Or was I supposed to go that way?
[173:04.17]I don't know which way I went.
[173:08.01]Did he go this way?
[173:10.45]I don't know which way- I don't know which way the fucking guy went.
[173:18.17]This is so hard.
[173:18.89]Dude, this is so hard.
[173:22.29]I feel like I'm driving- I feel like I'm driving every car in this game in an ice- in one of those tabletop ice hockey rinks.
[173:30.37]What are they called?
[173:32.36]air hockey.
[173:33.42]All these cars are air hockey rinks.
[173:39.67]It's just I'm playing fucking air hockey.
[174:27.61]Fucking God!
[174:28.51]It wouldn't... It doesn't... It's not hard to do that!
[174:31.15]How am I supposed to get this close?
[174:39.33]I'm... I'm pushing... I'm doing 70 fucking miles per hour!
[174:42.43]And I'm doing these tight turns?
[174:44.09]I'm gonna crash!
[174:51.86]Where'd he go?
[174:52.42]Where'd he go?
[174:52.78]Where'd he go?
[174:53.08]This way.
[174:57.28]It's fucking impossible.
[174:58.70]It is so hard to drive in this game.
[175:01.94]This is the hardest driving game I've ever done in my fucking life.
[175:04.48]It is so difficult to drive a car in this game.
[175:12.99]You gotta drift.
[175:13.45]Yeah, when I start drifting, I don't stop drifting and I just don't, I can't turn the car.
[175:24.00]I can't even turn the car!
[175:25.98]I can't turn!
[175:27.52]I feel like I'm in a tank!
[175:55.03]Slippery ass bullshit.
[175:56.09]I'm on icicles right now.
[175:57.99]I'm driving on a bed of ice.
[176:00.50]On every course.
[176:07.26]I have no control of the car.
[176:08.40]Do you see this?
[176:09.08]I don't have any control.
[176:28.55]I have no control of the car!
[176:29.77]I don't- I actually don't have control.
[176:33.05]Those of you who think this is like GTA 5 driving... How do you fucking mind?
[176:38.78]Those of you who think that- Dude, what the fuck?
[176:40.48]This is not GTA 5 driving!
[176:43.28]This is very, very difficult.
[176:45.54]It's very difficult.
[176:46.70]It's incredibly difficult.
[177:16.65]Where the fuck is he?
[177:17.57]I didn't even pay attention!
[177:18.67]Just crash!
[177:19.27]I don't care!
[177:33.93]This one's easy.
[177:35.73]Relax.
[177:43.46]I think your next game intuition is just... No, no, I don't need next game.
[177:48.38]It's really hard.
[177:50.12]I'm relaxed.
[177:50.76]I'm fine.
[177:51.34]I'm just very mad about sliding around on icicles in my car.
[177:59.06]And when I turn the wheel like this, the car just goes...
[178:18.61]How am I supposed to know that?
[178:19.65]That's how I'm supposed to know where I'm supposed to go.
[178:57.90]Did I win?
[179:07.30]Alright, I'm fucking doing this one.
[179:20.17]I don't care.
[179:22.98]Why does his mouth not move?
[179:24.94]I don't know, because sometimes my mouth doesn't move.
[179:27.74]Sometimes your mouth doesn't move when you scream.
[179:30.63]I'll fuck with, yeah, I'll fuck with gravity.
[179:31.99]I'll do the, I'm gonna get out of it.
[179:33.59]It's so addicting to me.
[179:35.95]I was literally, I was pressing left so hard that the stick came out of its socket.
[179:43.62]It went even more left.
[179:44.90]It went over heel left.
[180:27.63]He crashed!
[180:32.95]I did it!
[180:33.81]I won!
[180:36.99]He crashed without me!
[180:41.17]Just get in front of the car!
[180:43.97]Dude, he's done!
[180:45.41]He's done.
[180:46.29]He's not going anywhere.
[180:53.47]You're not gonna escape, man.
[180:54.95]It's over.
[180:55.41]I don't know what you crashed into.
[181:00.12]But I got you.
[181:00.72]Alright, one more.
[181:16.30]Whoa, this one.
[181:21.84]He still chips?
[181:28.05]Alright, jump from the dam and aim for the targets.
[181:37.49]Sure.
[181:40.29]Fuck it, who cares?
[181:40.95]Just go.
[181:44.64]Alright, well, I didn't know it was going to be...
[181:57.82]This person's just showing up.
[182:01.08]Get on the road.
[182:02.24]All right.
[182:03.04]Up and over.
[182:04.50]All right.
[182:04.98]How many points did I get?
[182:07.88]Zero.
[182:16.57]Okay.
[182:17.03]I didn't... I actually didn't even... What?
[182:19.25]Okay.
[182:19.45]This is... Do it again.
[182:20.39]Do it again.
[182:20.63]Do it again.
[182:31.40]Go!
[182:36.96]You gotta go really slow.
[182:39.36]Now you speed it up.
[182:40.12]I got it.
[182:54.38]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[182:58.81]Slow it down a little bit.
[183:11.74]Way too short.
[183:12.50]All right.
[183:28.51]I think that's it.
[183:34.01]Oh, yes!
[183:37.26]Got it.
[183:39.32]That was almost a perfect bullseye.
[183:42.33]Let's do it again.
[183:44.35]This one even further.
[183:45.57]How am I gonna get the one all the way back there?
[183:46.77]That one seems really far away.
[183:50.22]All the way in the back in the river?
[183:58.52]I don't think I'm gonna hit that one.
[183:59.76]How are you supposed to get that one?
[184:02.29]Look at that!
[184:05.71]Don't do the taxi.
[184:08.01]Oh!
[184:10.40]Okay.
[184:11.58]I thought I had to use this car.
[184:17.88]So we'll do a super fast car.
[184:20.66]What's the fastest car in the game?
[184:40.68]not even close to being fast.
[184:45.02]That's not gonna do it.
[184:47.72]I need the rocket bus.
[184:53.44]Will that actually do it?
[185:02.29]How do I press the button?
[185:24.10]Holy sh-sh-shit!
[185:26.40]I turned into a piece of taffy!
[185:28.72]Alright, I got it.
[185:51.79]Way too powerful.
[186:14.30]I gotta try to get it.
[186:15.12]What happened?
[186:44.10]That was fun.
[186:49.77]That was fun.
[186:50.09]How about Cliff?
[187:03.76]Cliff.
[187:03.94]And we'll use um...
[187:15.36]This one.
[187:16.84]This one.
[187:26.77]It really is just a cliff.
[187:43.31]So, a lot of people say, man, look at all this technology with the soft body damage and the car damage.
[187:49.35]This is so cool.
[187:50.83]Everybody was talking about how cool this was.
[187:54.01]When this game came out, right?
[187:55.09]It's been about five to ten years almost.
[188:00.57]The reason why they can't put this in games and why most car damage is kind of, it's okay, is because my computer right now is spending all of its resources rendering that.
[188:13.17]And correct me if I'm wrong, but you kinda can't render that everywhere.
[188:18.61]Is that accurate?
[188:25.45]Maybe one day.
[188:30.18]That was really fun.
[188:31.44]Let me do it with a fast car.
[188:35.12]Let me do it with the bus.
[188:47.97]No, what the fuck?
[188:49.07]I'm trying to go fast.
[188:50.55]I just broke his neck.
[188:55.55]Start over, start over.
[188:56.29]Again.
[188:58.05]R. How come R's not working?
[189:03.28]R's not working.
[189:07.56]R. Okay.
[189:14.31]There we go.
[189:14.59]Wait, I want to see it from here.
[189:31.14]Where am I?
[189:49.69]Oh, Bunker W. I want to get a bit- I want to- There we go.
[190:01.63]That's better.
[190:07.79]That was tons of damage.
[190:19.14]That's what in this part of the movie, all the main characters are all... Maybe one of them has a scratch right here.
[190:25.47]With a little bit of blood and a tiny bruise.
[190:27.77]And they all go in like this.
[190:28.53]Is everybody okay?
[190:31.99]One person's kind of lying down.
[190:33.07]With dirt here.
[190:38.52]They're all fine.
[190:48.40]Alright, let's do another map.
[190:57.20]I want to do, I want some more cars on the road.
[190:58.64]How about, how about just East Coast USA?
[191:03.74]Gas station parking lot, farmhouse, town, highway.
[191:07.98]Ooh, let's do the highway.
[191:12.70]Change the gravity.
[191:13.26]Yeah, I'm going to do a bunch of weird shit.
[191:16.59]Let's turn traffic on.
[191:18.83]Let's do... There's probably a piece of... Big thing of concrete in the way.
[191:22.46]Do the sawmill.
[191:29.26]Still haven't done the cannon.
[191:30.04]It's been three hours and no cannon.
[191:38.82]A hundred times slower than real time.
[191:42.58]What?
[191:42.86]Okay, that's kind of insane.
[191:46.58]Alright, I want...
[191:49.47]I want a different car.
[191:55.45]I want to drive... Is this like a van or something?
[192:04.67]Is this a Scooby Doo van?
[192:05.80]Is this the Mystery Machine?
[192:14.78]It actually is, okay.
[192:17.38]Go to the environments tab.
[192:20.12]Play.
[192:21.16]Okay.
[192:21.48]Noon.
[192:22.64]We're at noon.
[192:24.50]Cloud speed.
[192:25.78]Fog.
[192:27.18]It's foggy.
[192:31.08]Simulation speed.
[192:34.62]Gravity.
[192:36.16]Moon.
[192:36.44]Okay.
[192:40.58]Let's do vehicle config.
[192:47.91]Okay.
[192:51.84]Zoinks.
[192:52.20]Okay, now I need to do... I want AI.
[192:58.04]Traffic.
[192:59.70]Spawn traffic.
[193:03.30]And let's give it a shot.
[193:06.58]I'm spawning a lot of cars.
[193:07.56]Okay, here we go.
[193:08.44]Let's drive.
[193:22.68]We need a shaggy impression.
[193:26.47]Like, oh, this is quality entertainment.
[193:31.71]Like, this is quality entertainment.
[193:34.85]Not bad.
[193:39.74]Not bad.
[193:42.04]That wasn't bad.
[193:42.70]It actually wasn't even bad.
[193:47.68]That actually was not bad.
[193:49.10]That actually wasn't.
[193:52.31]I wasn't!
[193:52.71]Should we just put on the Scooby Doo theme song and just drive around?
[194:14.40]I love how this stream has just seriously been put on a song and drive to the song until you crash into a wall.
[194:23.41]That's all the content.
[194:25.19]That's the content of the entire day.
[194:28.15]It's been every single piece of content that we have done for over three plus three and a half hours.
[194:34.06]It's great.
[194:34.70]It's great content.
[194:36.14]It's amazing content.
[194:38.62]Okay, so here's the deal.
[194:40.43]Okay, we're going to make it at night.
[194:43.05]It's going to be spooky.
[194:43.83]We're going to put on the Mystery Machine theme song.
[194:47.73]Whatever the hell it is.
[194:48.45]Okay.
[194:49.25]Okay.
[194:54.14]Whatever.
[194:54.46]This is um... Scooby- What's new Scooby Doo?
[195:04.41]Is that a good one?
[195:16.75]This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.
[195:18.13]This is not what I want.
[195:19.41]This is the new Zoomer shit.
[195:20.17]By the way, that song is very good.
[195:22.14]I'm full of shit, by the way.
[195:45.26]Actually, this one might be better than the original.
[195:47.84]This one might be better than the original song.
[195:56.83]That's better than the original song.
[195:59.15]Really?
[195:59.45]And I think it might be.
[196:04.12]Alright, let's get what we want here.
[196:05.62]I want it to be nighttime.
[196:09.92]Gotta go solve that mystery.
[196:14.41]Make it foggy, right?
[196:15.95]Nice and... Ooh, scary.
[196:18.21]Earth gravity.
[196:18.91]No more of this bullshit.
[196:21.55]Okay, now I need headlights.
[196:23.55]How do I turn the headlights on?
[196:24.37]How do you turn on the headlights?
[196:34.58]I gotta be off camera.
[196:36.62]I need my headlights.
[196:43.14]L?
[196:43.26]Boss?
[196:44.92]Shut off.
[196:45.78]Wow, what is it?
[196:46.52]T?
[196:49.95]How do I turn the headlines on?
[196:51.41]N. Okay, thank you.
[196:52.85]Alright, you guys ready?
[196:55.01]You guys ready to solve the mystery?
[196:56.29]You ready to do the joke that we've done ten times today?
[196:59.65]I hope you're ready.
[197:00.49]Here we go.
[197:01.07]Time to solve that mystery.
[197:07.17]Wait, let me turn this down.
[197:08.03]This is going to be so loud.
[197:12.05]We're just replacing the actors.
[197:13.67]We're doing the same movie.
[197:22.95]Okay, here we go.
[197:37.84]It's too dark!
[197:45.74]It's too... I can't see.
[197:57.97]It's too dark, man.
[197:59.09]I can't actually see where I'm driving.
[198:06.73]Alright, I'll try it again.
[198:07.65]I have to do it until I can... Okay, here's the... Are you guys ready for the fucking challenge of the evening?
[198:12.35]The challenge of the evening is I'm going to try to drive pretty much... I can't go under 20 miles per hour for at least the intro of this show.
[198:21.94]I have to try to do this for the intro of the show.
[198:23.88]Just one full intro.
[198:26.66]You ready?
[198:28.13]Here we go.
[198:58.22]WHAT'S HEADLIGHTS?!
[199:11.25]N!
[199:11.95]I- I'll try it again!
[199:21.32]I'll try it again.
[199:21.98]I need to have the headlights on!
[199:23.36]N!
[199:23.40]Are they on?
[199:28.17]All right, let me get to a different fucking spot.
[199:29.83]Like, let me get to a different spot.
[199:32.52]This spot sucks.
[199:33.50]It's, I can't see what I'm doing.
[199:34.58]I can't see where I'm going.
[199:48.09]And I gotta, hold on.
[199:48.97]I gotta make this even better.
[199:50.01]Come on.
[199:51.07]Come on, Gwen.
[200:00.33]Okay, here we go.
[200:07.75]How's this gonna sound?
[200:08.53]Let's see.
[200:13.48]I'm just gonna put on, like, just background voice lines from the- Okay.
[200:19.40]This should be pretty- this should be alright.
[200:21.44]I need to get a better spot too, dude.
[200:22.93]Like, this is gonna be too hard.
[200:24.67]Let me get across the bridge.
[200:31.48]I gotta make sure the audio isn't all fucked up too.
[200:33.99]Let me turn the fog down, because you can't see shit.
[200:38.17]Turn the fog down.
[200:40.25]That's way better!
[200:41.57]Now we can actually see what we're doing.
[200:52.76]Okay.
[200:53.48]You guys ready?
[200:54.98]I'm ready.
[200:55.54]I'm ready to start this.
[200:58.10]I gotta get through one cycle.
[201:03.97]Let me get over here.
[201:06.87]One cycle of the theme song.
[201:08.05]That's all I'm looking for.
[201:10.04]Set this to home.
[201:11.64]Thank you for reminding me.
[201:14.98]Sounds good.
[201:17.02]Okay.
[201:17.94]Make sure the audio levels are good in three, two, one.
[201:42.72]It's not... It's too soft.
[201:45.10]It's too soft.
[201:46.72]The music's overpowering everything.
[201:53.97]That was the worst one by far.
[201:55.99]The gang calls the insurance company.
[202:05.07]Alright, I need a good...
[202:09.18]Okay, this is a better audio level.
[202:19.25]Okay.
[202:22.93]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[202:24.57]You guys ready?
[202:25.49]I'm gonna start over again.
[202:26.47]I have to do this until I get to one cycle.
[202:30.86]And turn the headlights on.
[202:31.94]3, 2, 1.
[202:47.97]We have to get out of here!
[203:17.19]It stalled.
[203:22.14]What?
[203:23.90]God damn it.
[203:25.54]Okay.
[203:25.90]All right.
[203:26.24]All right.
[203:26.50]All right.
[203:26.76]All right.
[203:27.02]All right.
[203:27.36]One.
[203:27.72]I'm going to do this one more time and I'm moving on again.
[203:37.56]Final time.
[203:38.58]Final time.
[203:39.38]Two times the song.
[203:41.34]Ugh.
[203:57.09]Hey, what happened to Daphne?
[204:17.50]That's so fucked up!
[204:18.84]That's so fucked up like we're gonna crash!
[204:21.87]Ugh!
[204:24.60]God damn it!
[204:25.58]Alright, let's go.
[204:26.54]Ready?
[204:26.96]Hey, Scooby-Doo!
[204:28.34]What's new?
[204:29.74]What's new, Scooby-Doo?
[204:30.96]How are ya?
[205:34.98]The car is so fucked up!
[206:08.71]I feel like my brain is rotting!
[206:29.80]Listen to that chat, y'all.
[206:45.04]And Scooby's great at being a train.
[207:32.27]Hold on, I need to pause.
[207:33.81]I need to just pause, my fucking head hurts.
[207:36.77]Scooby went through the shack?
[207:41.29]How many times has Scooby crashed?
[207:49.80]I feel like I was rotting your brains, I'm so sorry.
[207:52.10]I feel like everybody is dumber because of what just happened.
[207:56.96]I think everybody collectively, if there was ever going to be a scientist that wanted to do some observation here...
[208:02.91]The last five minutes, I think, may have dropped everybody's IQ here by five points.
[208:07.43]I think it happened.
[208:08.29]I really think it might have happened.
[208:09.86]I'm sorry.
[208:14.06]This has been playing the whole time muted.
[208:16.44]Okay.
[208:23.09]I'm back.
[208:24.33]That's too much.
[208:27.59]Oh, Scooby can't stop!
[208:33.56]What an absolute nightmare.
[208:38.00]I have a test tomorrow, why would you do that to me?
[208:47.13]God.
[208:53.50]What happened here?
[208:57.40]My favorite one, I think, is the bus.
[208:59.90]Just immediately, the intro starts and they crash directly into a bus.
[209:03.40]Immediately.
[209:04.02]The intro doesn't even happen yet.
[209:06.11]Here we go!
[209:07.85]Gone.
[209:12.29]Finals are coming up.
[209:13.01]Oh, they are.
[209:13.47]That's right.
[209:15.30]Well, good luck on them.
[209:15.94]Hope you do alright.
[209:19.52]Do Torgo's theme?
[209:25.83]I just want to hear the song now.
[209:30.37]Like, what a great, what a great tune.
[209:32.23]You know what I mean?
[209:35.11]Like, it's a great song.
[209:50.89]Who made this?
[209:58.29]Who made this one?
[210:00.89]Simple Plan?
[210:03.33]They did a great job.
[210:06.33]They actually did a great job.
[210:07.87]You know, here's the thing.
[210:09.61]A lot of times when they have a popular band at the time do a theme song for a show, it's usually like, whoa, hold on a second there.
[210:15.80]I'm not so sure about that.
[210:19.18]This is very, very good.
[210:21.26]They've ruined it.
[210:22.30]No, not this one.
[210:25.59]I think this is very- this is a good modern take on it.
[210:27.95]I think it's great.
[210:29.29]I think they did a fantastic job.
[210:37.73]This is horrible.
[210:38.53]No it's not!
[210:39.17]This is not Simple Plan?
[210:59.20]And why is this in the road?
[211:02.25]Why was that in the road?
[211:03.15]It is Simba Plant.
[211:04.25]Alright, well they did a great job.
[211:05.19]Alright, I want to change, change scenery.
[211:16.27]I want to change scenery.
[211:21.22]I hit that earlier, I did?
[211:22.52]Go back to the grid.
[211:28.63]Go to Utah.
[211:32.45]Utah?
[211:36.15]Let me go to the... Jesus.
[211:40.78]Where should I go?
[211:45.40]Scooby-Doo devs in the chat.
[211:48.86]That'd be weird considering thousands of people have worked on that show over the last 60 years.
[211:54.24]Okay.
[211:55.12]What do you mean the dev is here?
[211:59.35]Uh, maybe the repair zone?
[212:01.72]Let's check this out.
[212:10.42]The dev.
[212:11.36]The dev is here.
[212:12.36]Ruh-roh.
[212:21.69]Alright, how's this one look?
[212:27.11]Can the gas station explode?
[212:30.77]Zero.
[212:31.47]Give it a zero.
[212:31.95]Give the game a zero.
[212:35.36]I can't move.
[212:39.62]I want to spawn... Hmm.
[212:44.16]What is this thing here?
[212:46.81]What's the bus for?
[212:47.61]This bus station thing.
[212:50.27]Bus driver.
[212:50.95]What is that?
[212:58.46]Mr. Do is here?
[213:00.46]Mr. Scooby-Doo?
[213:01.62]Oh, it's like a desert bus?
[213:09.47]Okay.
[213:09.69]I want a new car.
[213:13.07]First of all.
[213:14.07]Manage.
[213:16.09]Manage.
[213:16.83]Select.
[213:19.37]Hmm.
[213:19.57]Hmm.
[213:21.92]I have not played with the cannon, so I'm going to take it out.
[213:24.82]These people are saying, play with the cannon, bro.
[213:27.13]Have you not shot the cannon yet?
[213:28.15]Because you probably can shoot it.
[213:29.75]You can.
[213:31.47]I did not.
[213:31.89]Okay, I didn't know you could shoot the cannon.
[213:33.71]So what do you want me to say?
[213:34.67]I wasn't aware of that.
[213:41.60]Cannonball was already fired.
[213:42.82]I can't shoot it again?
[213:43.44]How do you reload it?
[213:53.30]Okay.
[213:53.42]Let's do something with the cannon.
[214:05.26]Press insert.
[214:05.92]Oh, okay.
[214:06.20]Let me turn on traffic.
[214:12.43]No, I don't want to play that again.
[214:17.53]No, no, no, no, no.
[214:18.09]Back, back, back.
[214:20.49]What about fun stuff?
[214:22.56]Brake.
[214:23.58]Fire.
[214:24.32]What is this for?
[214:25.70]Tires?
[214:26.16]I just popped the tires.
[214:27.71]Okay, well, that's annoying.
[214:31.81]Alright, let's spawn, everybody.
[214:32.93]See if we can have a little bit of fun.
[214:39.25]And then we're going to change a couple things.
[214:43.84]I want to do electrics.
[214:50.82]Meh.
[214:53.46]Eh, alright.
[214:56.22]Shut up.
[214:57.56]Alright, let's shoot somebody with a cannon.
[215:08.69]Holy shit.

[215:16.00]Slow-mo.

[215:18.52]Alright, hold on.
[215:19.42]I wanna put something here.
[215:20.10]I'm gonna spawn something.
[215:25.02]I want to spawn a car and I want to do 100 times slow-mo.
[215:31.82]Maybe one of these.
[215:34.17]Yeah, just like a van.
[215:35.25]Okay.
[215:39.79]And then I want to do a camera angle here.
[215:41.61]No, I want to be... Wait, I want to get a good view.

[220:30.55]This is a cool experiment.
[220:40.62]Bat chest.
[220:42.50]Bat chest, bat chest, bat chest.
[220:45.46]Why am I getting bat chested?
[220:48.04]This is cool!
[220:48.90]That was really loud, I'm sorry.
[221:01.73]Alright, check this out, here we go!
[221:02.85]This is gonna be crazy insane.
[221:16.47]This is gonna be crazy insane!
[221:23.33]Here it comes!
[221:51.17]Whaaat?
[221:56.72]It went all the way through, but it stopped!
[221:59.40]Guys!
[222:00.74]Guys, it stopped!
[222:08.94]Guys, it stopped!
[222:18.90]It's kind of fun, actually.
[222:20.28]This is minor damage.
[222:21.42]Eh, it's kind of minor.
[222:22.32]Yeah, it is, like, just minor damage to the... I thought they would explode.
[222:26.98]Put on Ave Maria?
[222:33.09]Wait, that... Okay, hold on.
[222:59.89]I want a different car.
[223:00.57]This one's too sturdy.
[223:03.73]Something different.
[223:04.49]I mean, this is too sturdy.
[223:07.29]Something that'll just be like... Just like, I don't know, one of these cars?
[223:18.44]What's new Scooby-Doo?
[223:20.02]Coming after you.
[223:22.89]It's stuck in my head.
[223:23.59]It's in the ear.
[223:24.03]It's just in there.
[223:31.80]Okay.
[223:31.96]Do you want to play Ave Maria?
[223:34.80]Hitman song.
[223:40.68]This one.
[224:02.52]This is the Hitman song, right?
[224:19.43]Okay.
[224:21.93]Alright, I guess we're gonna do this.
[224:23.87]Let's go.
[224:24.35]Let me set it up.
[224:28.31]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[224:30.21]Is it DMCA warning?
[224:35.19]You know what?
[224:35.71]Let me tell you something.
[224:43.36]We used to do this thing on the channel where it was called Community Content Night.
[224:49.34]And...
[224:51.65]I would have just tons of videos and tons of stuff people would make that had a shitload of copyright material in it, right?
[224:59.12]And eventually it got to the point where it was like, wait, no, no, no, don't do that because we've got to be careful of the Twitch DMCA stuff.
[225:07.09]And it kind of didn't really matter.
[225:10.09]I probably could have kept doing it.
[225:13.07]It's kind of sad, because I kind of canned that two years ago or so.
[225:18.47]And there was this big scare about DMCA, and I don't know, it seems like that wasn't that big of a problem in 2020 hindsight here.
[225:32.46]The Scooby-Doo song probably already got claimed.
[225:36.74]Yeah, so the VOD might not be watchable, it'd be muted, which sucks, but I don't know.
[225:44.10]There was a big scare where it was like, your whole channel is going to get deleted.
[225:46.90]Everything, delete everything.
[225:48.16]They're going to, they're coming.
[225:49.52]They're going to strike you.
[225:50.62]And this just didn't happen.
[225:52.54]Maybe it happened.
[225:54.15]Did it happen to anybody?
[225:56.29]And especially with all the stuff, weren't people watching like television shows?
[226:02.94]I was terrified.
[226:04.74]There was one time there was a clip where it was Star Wars.
[226:08.70]It was like six minutes of Star Wars with a bunch of me being put in place of other characters.
[226:14.94]And I was so paranoid.
[226:17.94]I was sitting there going, I'm gonna, this is bad.
[226:20.12]I can't just, we're just watching Star Wars right now.
[226:22.08]We're just watching Star Wars.
[226:23.78]And, and then I had people watching TV shows.
[226:30.15]And I'm just sitting there going, I was so scared of having a minute or two of Star Wars with a bunch of shit in it.
[226:37.98]So now, maybe I would bring it back.
[226:40.64]I was terrified.
[226:41.40]Bet the videos?
[226:44.18]Yeah, well, we could probably do... Yeah, some people did get hit by... Yeah, some streamers did get hit by DMCA.
[226:52.32]Yeah, but I feel like it would be okay.
[226:57.41]I just thought they were coming down hard and that it was any copyright material was going to get you just dunked on.
[227:04.17]But that wasn't the case at all.
[227:08.94]It's not as bad nowadays.
[227:09.92]Yeah, I don't know.
[227:10.58]I was just like, okay, I guess we're going to try.
[227:12.90]Bring it back.
[227:14.96]If I was going to bring it, I can't bring it back.
[227:18.10]I can't bring it back unless I go in front of the screen again.
[227:23.22]That's how it works.
[227:25.54]I would only be able to bring it back if I did it again.
[227:30.36]A third time.
[227:30.96]Because then there would be even more, and that's when it would be, alright, let's go, I would do Greenscreen Night, Greenscreen Encore, Greenscreen... I think that would be fun.
[227:41.88]We would basically have to say no music, and if it was gonna, if you were gonna do something copywritten, it would have to be, enough would have to have been changed for it to be okay, right?
[227:52.95]But I remember when that happened.
[227:53.91]I remember sitting there going, this is bad.
[227:55.25]I got a can.
[227:55.87]This is one of my favorite.
[227:56.62]That was one of my favorite things on the channel.
[227:58.78]My favorite things.
[228:00.74]And we had to get rid of it because I was scared of DMCA.
[228:03.64]And then, like I said, a year or two later, it turns out all the everyone was so afraid that maybe that wasn't such a big deal.
[228:14.07]Or who knows?
[228:15.21]Watch it.
[228:15.85]I will do that.
[228:16.48]I'll bring that back.
[228:17.88]And there'll be a clip that gets me fucking destroyed.
[228:20.62]You know what I mean?
[228:21.60]It's just hard to tell.
[228:22.20]How am I supposed to even know if it's going to happen?
[228:27.59]So let's go ahead and do this.
[228:28.79]And get the channel fucking shut down forever.
[228:42.79]Thank you.
[229:14.85]Thank you.
[230:02.40]Oh, that's funny.
[230:14.01]What's new Scooby-Doo?
[230:16.73]That's funny.

[230:28.16]Actually, that destroyed this car.
[230:32.79]Jeez.

[230:34.79]This thing can still drive.

[243:08.53]Stream's over.

[243:12.81]I'm fucking out of here.
[243:14.06]This is too much.
[243:14.76]I'm done.
[243:23.84]Imagine if the fucking Scooby-Doo intro was this long, by the way.
[243:27.29]Why is this?
[243:27.77]Oh, it's 10-hour version.
[243:30.55]It's the 10-hour version.

[245:44.15]Helicopter shot.
[245:46.97]Ugh.
[245:52.12]That was playing for seven minutes.
[245:56.62]All the imposter vans, too.
[245:58.30]What a long intro.
[245:59.46]That's the intro to what's new Scooby-Doo?
[246:02.12]Is them just getting crashed into?
[246:03.50]Ugh.
[246:07.36]Jesus.
[246:16.11]I have a fucking headache.
[246:20.83]Oh my god.
[246:24.56]You know, I thought... I know that there's such a... I know it's going to be a car game and you're going to crash your car and you're going to laugh.
[246:38.36]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[246:39.86]I honestly... No, I'm not going to fulfill the destiny of every stream.
[246:43.97]I'm not going to laugh at the car accident.
[246:47.41]I laughed until I had a headache.
[246:50.52]Put on the Breaking Bad theme?
[246:52.16]Okay, fine.
[246:53.28]You know what?
[246:53.70]I have to.
[246:54.20]This is too funny.
[247:02.46]What's going on here?
[247:07.25]With the Mystery Mobile?
[247:11.05]God damn it.
[247:11.59]Alright, this is it.
[247:12.83]After this, I have to stop.
[247:14.75]My fucking head's gonna explode.
[247:29.68]Need to get an RV.
[247:30.92]God damn it, man.
[247:32.26]Alright, fine.
[247:33.28]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[247:34.30]I'll get an RV.
[247:35.04]I'll get an RV.
[247:37.79]And this is it.
[247:44.97]No more after this.
[247:45.53]I'm done.
[247:49.55]What would it be under?
[247:52.25]Like this?
[248:04.74]What would it be under?
[248:07.82]This thing?
[248:09.24]No.
[248:11.94]Travel trailer?
[248:15.40]Travel trailer.
[248:17.02]Oh, yep.
[248:18.58]God damn it.
[248:19.21]This is so stupid.
[248:20.17]This thing can't drive.
[248:29.03]Can it?
[248:29.35]I can't drive this.
[248:50.05]I can't drive it.
[248:59.82]Oh, here we go, here we go.
[249:00.62]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[249:04.31]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[249:15.95]It's not going to work.
[249:22.60]It's not going to work.
[249:27.70]I'm done.
[249:29.66]I have to put a truck on it?
[249:34.62]I think this one will work.
[249:36.12]This is fine.
[249:37.04]Just pretend this is an RV.
[249:38.00]Yeah, uh, like this one.
[249:54.62]Just use the van?
[249:55.90]That's a bus.
[250:01.99]We need to go somewhere else, too.
[250:10.45]Long jump cliff?
[250:15.65]Oh, this is GPS.
[250:17.19]I don't want to do that.
[250:17.87]Okay.
[250:24.23]It was Utah.
[250:29.30]Where the hell is Utah?
[250:34.92]Now we want to go to... Airfield?
[250:39.46]We've got to go way out there.
[250:41.84]Yeah, we're going to the airfield.
[250:43.26]Put a yellow filter on.
[250:44.83]Okay.
[250:48.83]And you know what I'm going to do.
[251:05.44]Hold on.
[251:09.42]Well, we'll set this up right.
[251:13.84]We just had a moment.
[251:14.88]Okay, yeah, the guy, the Geico gecko is a real person.
[251:17.52]Yeah, look, he's a real guy.
[251:19.28]Geico, he's a real, look, oh, he's behind the scenes.
[251:22.49]He's a real guy.
[251:23.35]He's a real person talking into the camera.
[251:25.39]Okay, cool.
[251:29.49]It's me.
[251:29.79]I'm alone.
[251:37.62]No one's looking for you.
[251:39.40]Okay, hold on.
[251:40.06]Okay, what was the right one you said it was?
[251:47.20]Select.
[251:49.02]Jesse.
[251:50.84]This one here.
[251:53.05]And... What's the best one?
[251:56.37]Probably this one here, right?
[252:05.69]Is there a better one?
[252:22.19]The one below it?
[252:23.50]I wish I could... Wait, hold on.
[252:27.12]The one that was next to it?
[252:37.08]This one here?
[252:38.50]Okay, so what color should I make it?
[252:40.00]Is that all right?
[252:41.65]The Vanster?
[252:44.25]What color?
[252:46.11]The default or this one?
[252:49.01]This brown color, right?
[252:49.95]Hmm.
[252:56.78]Let me put a filter on this too, like an orange filter, right?
[253:35.93]Do we need yellow?
[253:37.37]Kind of hard to do.
[253:37.97]The hue shift is going to be really weird looking.
[253:47.42]I think that's OK.
[253:53.42]Unless, can I add?
[253:54.26]I'm not sure there's any filter I can add to this to make it.
[254:01.92]Oh, hold on.
[254:02.22]There we go.
[254:08.89]Okay, color corrector.
[254:10.27]Yeah, it's gonna be hard to do.
[254:11.99]Make a transparent layer.
[254:14.27]How does this look in the actual game?
[254:18.38]I mean that's, I don't know, that's pretty close.
[254:22.22]That could be it.
[254:27.77]That's not that bad.
[254:31.03]Up to saturation?
[254:42.37]This just looks like an iPad game.
[254:43.73]It looks like a cartoon.
[254:55.75]Hold on, it's getting better.
[255:10.30]Better Fortnite math.
[255:11.94]It does look like a Fortnite.
[255:22.35]Alright, that's good.
[255:41.83]Okay.
[255:42.05]Here we go.
[255:45.39]Less red and less blue.
[255:47.47]Guys, I can't do color correction on this.
[255:50.65]It doesn't like it.
[255:51.15]It doesn't want me to.
[255:52.27]Wait, hold on.
[255:55.11]Um... Be careful.
[255:57.15]This might hurt your eyes.
[255:58.87]I would say just maybe... Hold on.
[256:00.45]Let me make sure it doesn't... This isn't going to be bad.
[256:05.93]Um... This actually might be annoying to look at, so just be aware of that.
[256:10.55]I'm serious.
[256:32.76]Alright, that's looking pretty close.
[256:47.77]More yellow?
[256:54.29]Okay, that's definitely it.
[256:56.26]That's 100% right.
[257:06.24]Okay, here you go.
[257:06.90]You ready?
[257:09.54]It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad.
[257:12.45]Hey, uh, it's me.
[257:15.49]I'm alone.
[257:22.63]Oh, shit.
[257:23.17]What am I, stupid?
[257:24.19]How'd you find me?
[257:25.70]You're still in our filing system.
[257:31.54]Your aunt owns this place, right?
[257:35.04]Eye on it.
[257:39.60]Look, no one's looking.
[257:41.48]Why are you here?
[257:43.30]I was... curious.
[257:45.11]Fuck!
[257:46.17]Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but... That didn't fatter me.
[257:51.17]Spawn cops.
[257:52.01]I didn't measure that.
[257:54.07]Okay, hold on.
[257:56.77]A lot of money in it, huh?
[257:58.75]I don't know what you're talking about.
[258:00.35]No?
[258:00.91]Not a clue.
[258:04.27]Captain Cook?
[258:06.51]That's not you?
[258:14.28]Like I said, no one is looking.
[258:16.56]I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mrs. White.
[258:19.50]I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bullwinder about getting right with Jesus or turning myself in... Not really.
[258:27.32]High school was a long time ago.
[258:30.20]Where are the police?
[258:41.85]Where are the police?
[258:43.37]Where are the police?
[258:44.35]What was that?
[258:45.19]Where are the police?
[258:46.07]I spawned them, they don't fucking exist.
[258:54.14]Hold on, where are the police?
[259:03.43]Alright, I'm gonna turn traffic off.
[259:06.13]This is the last thing I'm doing before I'm outta here.
[259:09.45]Okay, AI.
[259:12.21]Traffic.
[259:13.49]Remove traffic.
[259:17.20]I'm gonna stay on the road.
[259:18.72]Okay, traffic is off.
[259:21.96]Spawn police.
[259:24.40]And then... chase me, right?
[259:27.08]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[259:28.76]What the fuck, that's so many!
[259:32.43]Okay.
[259:33.95]Now, come get me.
[259:35.41]You guys ready?
[259:37.01]Here we go.
[259:37.37]Here it is.
[259:42.03]Short speech.
[259:44.11]You lost your partner today.
[259:45.35]What's his name?
[259:48.41]Emilio?
[259:50.87]Emilio has gone to prison.
[259:55.19]DEA took all your money, your lab.
[259:59.79]You've got nothing.
[260:01.51]Square one.
[260:03.98]But you know the business.
[260:07.12]And I know the chemistry.
[260:12.64]I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up.
[260:16.49]You, uh, you wanna cook crystal meth?
[260:33.46]You.
[260:34.98]You and, uh... and me.
[260:38.53]That's right.
[260:43.13]Either that... ...or I turn you in.
[260:57.10]This is fucking stupid.
[261:00.46]This is fucking dumb, man.
[261:02.48]This is dumb.
[261:03.96]This isn't even close to being as funny as the other one.
[261:17.05]Oh, Mr. White.
[261:19.81]I was trying to just go off a cliff.
[261:21.57]I was trying just to drive off a cliff.
[261:25.90]I was just pedal to the metal.
[261:27.30]Alright, I'm done.
[261:28.64]Turn all these filters off.
[261:29.56]This looks like shit.
[261:32.40]Please don't sue me and don't fucking remove my stream.
[261:38.91]Turn this off before I hurt anybody else's eyes that come to watch the stream.
[261:41.71]Look at how much nicer that looks.
[261:44.33]Alright, I'm out.
[261:44.85]I'm gonna go.
[261:45.61]I'm gonna go.
[261:46.07]My head hurts.
[261:48.19]My fucking brain hurts.
[261:49.09]This is so loud.
[261:56.25]Well, that was really funny.
[261:57.31]I successfully evaded the police.
[261:58.71]Okay, well, that's good to know.
[261:59.67]Let's throw out the car.
[262:01.67]Alright, I will see you guys, um... What's today?
[262:07.01]Maybe tomorrow?
[262:10.39]Yeah, I'll be... Tomorrow's Wednesday.
[262:13.51]Let's go.
[262:13.91]Something's happening tomorrow.
[262:14.91]I thought... Wait, what's happening tomorrow?
[262:19.09]Something is happening tomorrow, and I don't know what it is.
[262:23.15]Okay, well, I don't know what it is, but we're gonna do it on Thursday.
[262:26.67]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[262:27.49]We're going to do... What was it going to be?
[262:36.32]What the hell was it going to stream?
[262:40.44]Oh, the new House Flipper update.
[262:42.83]House Flipper Pets DLC came out.
[262:44.31]It looks actually really good.
[262:46.67]We're going to do House Flipper Pets on Thursday.
[262:50.75]And then this weekend, probably on... Saturday or Sunday?
[262:55.01]We'll do some horror stuff.
[262:57.37]So we'll, yeah, we'll go do Tuesday, we'll do Thursday, we'll do Saturday.
[263:01.29]Maybe Saturday, Sunday?
[263:04.39]These people are still trying to kill me.
[263:08.16]Thanks for watching as always, everybody.
[263:09.62]Let me just say goodbye to you properly, right?
[263:12.10]Thanks for watching.
[263:13.36]That was really funny.
[263:14.60]My brain just hurts.
[263:17.43]So I gotta get out of here.
[263:19.05]I'll see you on Thursday.
[263:20.87]House Flipper Pets.
[263:23.27]And then we got Murder House and Blood Wash to play.
[263:25.41]I might be able to even do another one.
[263:27.55]This is probably only like an hour long.
[263:31.27]I'll see you soon.
[263:31.97]That was a ton of fun.
[263:32.95]That was... This game's great.
[263:35.76]I've seen this game played a million times, but I just never bought it.
[263:40.54]So, here it is.
[263:41.82]Really good.
[263:42.14]BeamNG.
[263:44.26]That's fantastic.
[263:45.62]So, I'll see you guys later.
[263:46.28]See you Thursday.
[263:46.88]Thanks for watching.
[263:47.40]Good night.
[263:47.80]Goodbye.
[263:48.26]Take care of yourselves.
[263:49.66]Call your mother.
[263:50.78]You know.
[263:54.38]See you soon.
[263:56.98]This stream was fucked up.
[264:00.91]Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
[264:04.79]But, I don't know, I think I had a lot of fun.
[264:08.97]I gotta exit the game.
[264:09.77]How do I get out of here?
[264:16.55]I'm actually looking forward to the house flipper update.
[264:19.92]There's actually tons of animals.
[264:21.54]It's not just dogs and cats.
[264:24.74]I think there are birds, bunnies, gerbils.
[264:27.82]There's a ton of stuff.
[264:28.54]I'm going to have an entire huge pet family.
[264:36.79]There are turtles.
[264:41.81]What about webbed?
[264:44.25]Webbed is just going to be one of those games that I sit in the back pocket.
[264:48.50]Or whenever I decide to play it.
[264:51.40]I promise I am going to play it at some point.
[264:53.44]Within the next 30 days.
[264:54.48]Or within the next two weeks.
[265:02.00]Is Webb going to be the new Glover?
[265:04.56]Um... No, I mean, I played Glover.
[265:06.52]Everybody hated it.
[265:07.18]Everybody screamed at me and told me to leave.
[265:17.31]Promises equal lies.
[265:22.01]I'm just a very excitable person.
[265:23.85]So I will say something that I really want to do.
[265:25.83]And I go, yeah, that sounds amazing.
[265:29.33]That sounds like an incredible idea.
[265:31.89]Then two or three weeks later, when you go, hey, remember when you said that?
[265:34.75]You said you promised you were going to play it.
[265:37.24]Oh, whoops.
[265:40.18]Bring back Community Content Night.
[265:42.95]Like I said before, if I'm gonna bring back Community Content Night, I'm gonna wanna do another batch of green screen stuff.
[265:49.19]That's where it's the most fun for me.
[265:52.40]So that's when you'll know.
[265:54.68]If you hear me announce in the next few weeks, I'm going back in front of the screen.
[266:00.00]Then we'll do more.
[266:06.83]What about Bionicle?
[266:09.23]I don't have the rights to stream Bionicle.
[266:11.51]I don't think I can get them.
[266:15.26]Public domain movies?
[266:16.16]Yeah.
[266:17.95]I still want to do that too.
[266:18.71]How about retrying Halo?
[266:31.84]Yeah... I'm just not a Halo guy.
[266:37.62]It's cool.
[266:41.85]What about the Switch Sports game?
[266:43.85]That did come out.
[266:45.33]Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[266:49.60]There's a lot of stuff to play, so we can put it in the backlog.
[266:57.39]Alright, guys.
[266:57.81]I'll see you later.
[266:58.33]See you Thursday.
[266:58.85]Thanks for watching.
[266:59.43]Good night.
[267:00.47]Goodbye.
[267:00.81]See you soon.
[267:21.19]you
[267:56.06]you
