[ve:60.16.100]

[01:11.86]I'm trying to think of the title.
[01:13.44]I can't really think of one.
[01:16.00]How do I convey all of my feelings?
[01:18.40]I don't know.
[01:19.32]You know what I mean?
[01:23.12]How do you convey feelings?
[01:30.35]Let's just go ahead and make a Twitter tweet here.
[01:32.63]I mean, it just says Red Dead Redemption.
[01:36.09]I gotta change that.
[01:42.46]I mean, one sec.
[01:44.61]I can think of a grabber, you know what I mean?
[02:20.86]Alright, so today, hopefully, is a little different than last time, than on Friday.
[02:31.52]Those of you that were here on Friday, you do realize what happened, and maybe you don't, maybe you do if you weren't here.
[02:37.69]Well, then, hey, we're going to play Red Dead Redemption on an off day.
[02:42.83]Just give me one moment while people kind of get in here.
[02:48.54]Friday was a fucking disaster.
[02:50.27]Yes, it was.
[02:52.51]It was such a disaster.
[02:55.85]It gave me... It gave me all... I honestly, like, today, like, I'm gonna... Let's talk about, like, medical shit, right?
[03:03.75]I do not feel well today.
[03:06.41]I'm having, like, I'm having, like, a colitis attack today and yesterday.
[03:11.68]I think it's because of the stress that happened on Friday.
[03:15.43]I swear to God, I, like, put myself into a flare-up because of Friday.
[03:20.64]Like, seriously.
[03:24.20]I really, truly believe this.
[03:28.92]Anyways, um... My microphone is low?
[03:32.82]What happened?
[03:33.98]What the fuck is going on here?
[03:38.66]Did it, like, lower me?
[03:40.56]I don't know why.
[03:41.66]Hold on.
[03:45.08]Why?
[03:47.80]Why is my mic so low?
[03:51.56]I don't know.
[03:55.13]Am I low?
[03:55.93]Like, do I sound really fucking low right now?
[03:57.83]Yeah, I love the title.
[04:01.99]Red Dead Redemption.
[04:03.11]Red Dead Redemption.
[04:09.00]What's a good title?
[04:14.15]Red Dead.
[04:17.56]Get out of my head.
[04:18.34]Is that good?
[04:24.92]Is that a quality title?
[04:26.04]Red Dead?
[04:26.62]Get out of my head.
[04:27.42]Is that good?
[04:40.40]Red Dead, get out of... No, that's awful.
[04:42.34]Red Dead, take... I'm just gonna do what it was before.
[04:44.38]No, Red Dead, take two, because that's exactly what it is.
[04:54.99]Red Dead re-redemption.
[04:58.59]Alright, let's go.
[04:59.49]Let's switch this off.
[05:02.19]Move this over here.
[05:05.01]Get this microphone to sit right in front of my face.
[05:10.28]And, okay.
[05:12.50]Look at this.
[05:13.24]We're already ready to go.
[05:15.54]No wasted time.
[05:16.72]No bullshit.
[05:19.50]I'm ready to start playing Red Dead immediately.
[05:23.85]Hey, look at that.
[05:25.17]No wasting time.
[05:26.05]Here we go.
[05:27.45]We're not doing it on hardcore.
[05:29.39]And this is on the Xbox because I went and bought the fucking game.
[05:32.89]I own this game now.
[05:34.09]I've owned the video game.
[05:35.33]Red Dead Redemption.
[05:36.19]Bought it.
[05:38.46]Let's go.
[05:38.70]I'm always gonna watch... Okay, I just saw alert.
[05:43.73]And I was about to fucking scream.
[05:45.57]I thought it was gonna tell me that this was not playable for some reason.
[05:48.67]You don't give a giant red screen that says alert.
[05:52.75]Like, seriously.
[05:54.79]Okay, create a new save.
[05:57.61]Warning.
[05:58.03]No, don't give me a warning either.
[05:59.89]Like, don't do that.
[06:01.71]Again, I thought something was wrong.
[06:04.69]We went from alert to warning.
[06:06.52]okay what did say if there's an auto save cloud saved games offline I don't even whatever alerts you don't own this game alright we don't I'm not connected like ps now we're like physically going to play Red Dead Redemption god I hope I don't like blue screen I've been having blue screen problems with this computer too
[06:32.11]Alright, now we can enjoy this cutscene.
[06:33.99]And I'm going to shut up.
[06:35.09]Enjoy my first ever time playing Red Dead Redemption.
[06:37.93]I've never played it before.
[06:39.31]I've always wanted to.
[06:40.09]So I'm going to pay attention because I want to know the story.
[06:44.09]I'm not angry right now.
[06:49.53]I'm happy.
[06:50.58]I'm in a good place.
[06:55.90]I'm happy.
[06:59.52]Watch out, nobody's standing under that.
[07:02.18]I've seen cartoons before.
[07:03.44]Oh, I gotta turn on, uh... I gotta turn on subtitles.
[07:20.53]Turn this down a little bit, because it's a little loud for me.
[07:25.99]Rockstar Games presents.
[07:27.46]I'm getting flashbacks.
[07:28.64]We did get to see this at least.
[07:35.28]I promise I'm not using a microwave right now.
[07:39.25]Yeah, okay.
[07:39.73]Two minutes defrost.
[07:42.03]And go.
[07:47.66]A Rockstar Sandwich production.
[07:55.22]It's not high noon.
[07:55.90]It's like 10 o'clock.
[07:56.70]Did somebody say bootleg McCree?
[08:10.13]This came out a long time ago.
[08:15.85]Alright, now everybody quiet.
[08:16.77]Everybody quiet now.
[08:17.51]I'm gonna watch the cutscene.
[08:18.39]Everybody shut up.
[08:19.19]Everybody stop talking.
[08:20.22]I keep hearing you guys talk.
[08:23.15]No chatting, that's talking.
[08:25.22]Sit there with your hands on your lap, with your fists together, like just sitting on your lap.
[08:31.27]No talking.
[08:34.85]Well, I for one am grateful, Mrs. Bush, that they are finally bringing civilization to this savage land.
[08:42.77]I could not agree with you more, my dear.
[08:45.55]My daddy said of this land, and I know he'll be looking down on us, pleased at how we helped the natives.
[08:52.22]Game of the year.
[08:52.64]Yes, they've lost their land, but they've gained access to heaven.
[08:57.50]Game of the year.
[09:01.20]Oh, shit.
[09:06.13]But father, do you mean unless an innocent receives communion, they're destined to go to hell?
[09:12.13]It hardly seems fair.
[09:13.89]What I mean to say, Jenny, is that there is a great deal of difference between an innocent and a savage.
[09:20.38]I never thought of it that way.
[09:22.40]Yes, they lived like animals, but they're happier now.
[09:25.89]This is Westworld.
[09:35.19]Not only do people now have motor cars, father, but I heard that pretty soon we will be able to fly.
[09:42.97]No, only angels can fly, Jenny.
[09:46.13]No, no, apparently people can fly.
[09:49.09]Didn't you hear?
[09:49.75]Out in Kansas, a man even got a car to fly.
[09:53.13]I hardly think so, Jenny.
[09:56.96]Corrupted?
[09:57.72]Stop saying that.
[09:59.48]Stop saying the game's going to be corrupted.
[10:01.22]Stop talking about crashes and blue screens.
[10:04.14]You're giving me anxiety.
[10:05.80]Which is why he's so concerned with cleaning up the state.
[10:10.30]Nate Johns.
[10:12.32]Yes.
[10:13.12]His family is nothing but ill-billed trash that came here after the war.
[10:18.99]I don't want to be judgmental, but this state should not be ruled by such a disgusting family.
[10:26.24]A family without class.
[10:29.62]Apparently, the Johns family have made a lot of money, and he has a lot of friends in politics.
[10:37.12]Mrs. Bush, money isn't everything.
[10:40.68]There are many things that money cannot buy.
[10:43.40]It seems that money can buy voters, though.
[10:53.12]What you must remember, my dear, is that we have been brought here to spread the word.
[10:58.91]And the word and civilization, they are the same thing.
[11:02.84]They are the gifts.
[11:04.80]It is the opportunity we have.
[11:07.16]The chance to live among people who are decent and who do not kill each other.
[11:13.69]And who let you worship in peace.
[11:17.45]I kind of want to change that.
[11:19.57]Steve Martin?
[11:20.73]Steve Martin?
[11:21.89]Like, wait, the banjo old school comedian Steve Martin?
[11:54.96]Okay.
[11:55.92]That was a pretty good opening cutscene.
[11:57.20]Go to the salon.
[11:59.74]Go get yourself a fucking crew cut.
[12:01.64]Mm-hmm.
[12:03.69]Guy reading the paper.
[12:07.89]Remember yesterday when I got to do, like, one thing and it was shoot this guy?
[12:11.01]Remember?
[12:11.75]We have to, like, we have to... No, I'm not doing that again.
[12:15.31]We're trying to stay away from last night.
[12:17.93]Okay.
[12:18.21]Uh, we did it.
[12:25.69]Hey, we did it.
[12:26.29]Alright, let me turn on subtitles.
[12:34.95]I know, I can already tell I'm going to like this game.
[12:38.79]I do.
[12:39.39]I'm going to like this game.
[12:41.59]It's a Rockstar game.
[12:42.53]How could you not like a Rockstar game?
[12:45.17]Okay, let's go.
[12:49.52]Going to saloon.
[12:53.06]I think I can run.
[12:53.86]Let's go in here.
[12:57.47]This is what happened last time.
[12:58.83]I hope you do like it.
[13:02.93]I probably will.
[13:03.55]I love Rockstar Games.
[13:04.73]Mr. Marston!
[13:06.31]Mr. Marston, over here!
[13:11.55]Wait, somebody gave a hundred... Oh, my God.
[13:13.32]Somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[13:14.54]Sneagle gave a hundred dollars.
[13:16.04]You must be John Marston.
[13:17.32]Sometimes.
[13:18.68]I'm Jake.
[13:19.74]Your friends from Blackwater hired me to guide you.
[13:22.60]They ain't my friends.
[13:23.58]They're pleased to meet you, Jake.
[13:26.07]After this cutscene, we'll cover Sneak Ill's $100.
[13:27.76]Because that's a lot of money.
[13:36.72]I cannot hear notifications.
[13:38.38]So let me pause for a second.
[13:39.60]I can't hear notifications because I'm currently my headphones are plugged into the TV so I can hear the Xbox because there's no I don't have like an audio splitting thing.
[13:48.52]I don't have like a mixer.
[13:49.36]I'm like a very unprofessional streamer.
[13:51.08]If you didn't know, I have like the console.
[13:54.22]I have my computer and I have like a pair of headphones.
[13:56.82]I don't have like a mixer or anything like that.
[13:58.38]I'm fucking I don't even know how to use that.
[14:01.66]But anyways, Sneagil, thank you for the $100.
[14:05.72]And you say, are you sure you own this game?
[14:07.94]Seriously though, despite all the technical issues on Friday, I laughed my ass off.
[14:10.74]Hopefully you get to enjoy the great game in peace.
[14:13.70]Lots of love.
[14:14.16]Here's a hundred bucks, jermaSlug.
[14:18.28]Well, I hope so.
[14:20.77]I really do, dude.
[14:23.77]I've heard so many great things about this game and I've wanted to play it for so many years.
[14:28.36]But there was no way for me to do it.
[14:31.04]This just barely got to backwards compatibility.
[14:34.00]Like, what?
[14:34.84]Like this past year?
[14:35.78]Not even?
[14:36.20]Like a few months ago?
[14:39.51]Thank you for the $100.
[14:42.91]Extremely generous of you, dude.
[14:48.01]Company Jake to Fort Luxor.
[14:49.43]Okay, let's go, Jake.
[14:53.95]Spur your horse to move faster, tap A. If you hold A, hold R, R, B. Alright, well, it's different buttons now because it was on PlayStation fucking 4 last night.
[15:07.46]So it's Port Mercy you want to visit?
[15:09.50]That's right.
[15:10.68]Ain't taking nobody up to the port in a long time.
[15:14.00]Please wait for a decent fella to want to visit, if you don't mind me saying.
[15:18.67]Who said I was a decent fella?
[15:20.71]It's been abandoned for years now.
[15:23.21]Folks say it was built during a Mexican war.
[15:25.27]What kind of soldiers round back then?
[15:27.98]Why'd they leave?
[15:29.42]I ain't entirely sure.
[15:30.98]I heard they had to go off north to find enemies though.
[15:34.76]Maybe they got tired of being soldiers and went looking for gold.
[15:38.14]Cool.
[15:38.64]You know how things is.
[15:40.64]This is the best.
[15:41.20]Yeah, that's what I heard.
[15:42.04]This is like the best fucking game ever.
[15:43.72]So I obviously want to try.
[15:46.26]I've never had an opportunity to.
[15:47.50]Game is a lot of gold.
[15:48.78]Is that better?
[15:57.09]Loud game.
[15:57.83]Loud.
[15:58.09]It's too loud.
[15:58.93]There.
[16:01.15]I got it.
[16:04.23]I can't hear you.
[16:09.41]So, welcome to Western Week.
[16:10.65]We're gonna, like, play this.
[16:11.62]If I enjoy this, I'm gonna play this for the next, like, week.
[16:14.48]I'm gonna, like, beat the game if I'm having a lot of fun with it, you know?
[16:18.02]Well, if you're fixing for some female company, you can do a lot worse than Armadillo.
[16:23.64]Fine as cream cream.
[16:26.94]I know a character that said that before.
[16:29.87]Alright, so how far do we get on Friday?
[16:35.43]Like, up until when there was a cutscene over here?
[16:37.13]Alright, uh, stick shooting is gonna be hard.
[16:48.22]Well, I didn't mean to aim it at you.
[16:52.89]I'm getting a lot of, uh... Like, you know in GTA 5 when you go out into the wilderness?
[16:59.91]Getting a lot of those vibes.
[17:05.66]I got shot, and then we got disconnected.
[17:07.74]Oh, okay.
[17:08.36]I'm just making sure I, like, remember this correctly.
[17:12.22]You ain't very talkative, are you?
[17:14.28]Nope.
[17:14.86]I'm just chewing the dog.
[17:17.83]What does that mean?
[17:19.97]Chewing the dog?
[17:22.61]And yes, I am aware that the first half an hour to 45 minutes of this game is a lot of setup.
[17:28.39]Hold me to focus on important people.
[17:33.26]Oh, okay.
[17:34.12]Thank you, Madman, for the bits.
[17:37.34]I hope you like this game.
[17:38.28]I hope you love it.
[17:38.84]It's great.
[17:40.32]I am looking forward to it.
[17:41.14]I'm excited.
[17:44.51]Here we go.
[17:47.24]This here is what's left of Fort Mercer.
[17:50.04]Some gang rode in and took the place over.
[17:53.22]Also, thanks to Power to the Players for the bits as well.
[17:56.38]His message is, shh.
[17:59.39]Sorry.
[18:05.57]Sorry.
[18:06.11]I gotta stop.
[18:06.71]This is not like a joke.
[18:07.63]We're not gonna make any jokes on this stream, by the way.
[18:10.49]This is a play that... That's a lie.
[18:14.12]Forget what I'm trying to say.
[18:17.72]This is my first playthrough.
[18:19.12]I've never played it before.
[18:20.24]Let's just get up to the door.
[18:29.98]Plug my headphones into the computer for a second.
[18:32.92]What are you talking about?
[18:36.49]Is it like an ad playing?
[18:37.79]What do you mean?
[18:38.35]What's going on?
[18:38.95]Why do I have to do this?
[18:41.11]What do I have to do?
[18:42.23]Why am I doing this?
[18:45.09]Is there something going on?
[18:46.55]What's going on?
[18:48.63]What's going on?
[18:49.13]Bill Williamson!
[18:51.49]Come out here right now!
[18:55.77]Go away now, John.
[18:57.07]What the fuck is happening?
[18:58.98]Don't make me kill you.
[19:00.82]Nobody needs to kill him, Bill.
[19:02.14]Wait, wait, what?
[19:04.80]Has somebody been doing this the whole time?
[19:06.58]You must think I was born yesterday.
[19:09.80]You always did think I was an idiot.
[19:11.76]Wait, where am I?
[19:13.36]That ain't fair, Bill.
[19:15.80]You were as my brother.
[19:18.28]I've been in here since the stream started.
[19:23.54]Did you guys hear me, like, pick my ass?
[19:29.35]Oh, they can't hear you guys on stream.
[19:30.81]Oh, my God.
[19:31.53]Oh, what the fuck?
[19:32.67]When did we get access to the call again?
[19:34.71]Bill.
[19:45.34]What the fuck?
[19:46.10]Alright, well, I... Let me just, like, say... People have no idea what the hell's going on.
[19:50.24]You guys are unmuted now?
[19:52.63]I've just been in a fucking Discord voice channel this whole time.
[19:56.57]Hey, stream.
[19:58.87]What have I done?
[20:01.01]What do you mean, what have you done?
[20:02.03]Why am I so unprofessional?
[20:03.44]Alright, well, that's... By the way, these are the mods.
[20:08.52]This is the team of mods.
[20:10.50]Say hello to the mods.
[20:11.54]What?
[20:13.77]Alright, well, I'll see you guys in like, I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[20:17.05]Alright, have fun.
[20:18.39]What the fuck am I, what am I, how am I, alright, let's just play.
[20:26.18]Go plug in your fucking headphones.
[20:29.72]Oh, I am a fucking moron, apparently.
[20:32.56]I just, okay, this, we got here.
[20:37.49]Good shot.
[20:38.43]I remember this.
[20:42.72]It's like sitting in a fucking Discord.
[20:47.93]Alright, so this is where we got to last night.
[20:52.59]Hold on, that's not game over.
[20:57.41]Isn't that supposed to happen?
[21:04.68]Wait, that was not supposed to happen?
[21:15.53]Bad ending.
[21:16.31]Hey, thank you.
[21:19.25]Let me touch your bum for 10 bucks.
[21:20.93]Are you sure you bought this copy of Red Dead Redemption TM for Xbox TM?
[21:26.20]Find another couple of copies.
[21:27.18]Yeah, by the way, I did buy this twice.
[21:31.06]This is the second time I purchased this game.
[21:36.52]Thank you to MooMeansMoo as well for 10 bucks.
[21:38.28]There's a snake in my boot.
[21:39.54]Love the streams, Jerma.
[21:40.26]You never fail to make me laugh.
[21:41.28]And this game kicks ass.
[21:42.66]Good.
[21:44.74]Alright, I got shot.
[21:45.74]That's all I know.
[21:46.20]I am.
[21:51.78]Did I fuck this up somehow?
[21:54.83]How did I fuck this up?
[21:56.61]Is that better?
[21:57.05]Is that like better?
[21:57.57]Can you hear me better?
[21:58.57]Stupid!
[21:59.17]Oh god.
[21:59.35]That might be a little too much.
[22:00.39]Stupid.
[22:00.59]That might be too much.
[22:17.38]It cost us $15.
[22:18.08]Yeah, okay, I turned it down.
[22:21.96]Now it's loud again.
[22:24.60]Did you want to die?
[22:25.96]I mean, was that it?
[22:27.30]Was that why you went straight out to the grocery and picked a fight with the worst baby?
[22:30.97]Get out of my head.
[22:32.55]That's actually, I think that's okay.
[22:33.81]Is that okay?
[22:34.41]Are we better?
[22:35.59]John Marston.
[22:37.17]Bonnie McFarlane.
[22:38.85]Miss Bonnie McFarlane.
[22:41.95]Well, you may be right, Miss McFarlane.
[22:44.63]I don't know.
[22:46.23]So what were you doing?
[22:49.00]Get closer.
[22:49.28]Why does everybody call you dumb in this game?
[22:50.96]This lady's called me stupid like five times.
[23:16.34]Now I'm gonna take my time and go after him the less kind way.
[23:20.40]Well, that sounds very fun, Mr. Marston.
[23:22.78]Quite heroic.
[23:23.98]Just like in those penny dreadfuls my brother used to read.
[23:26.06]It's always gonna be like this.
[23:27.38]Meanwhile, if you'll excuse me, I've got a ranch to run.
[23:30.78]Of course, if you're feeling better, why not take a ride with me later?
[23:33.86]Help me patrol the perimeter.
[23:35.65]You can earn back some of that money we wasted on doctor's bills.
[23:38.75]Of course.
[23:39.21]And thank you.
[23:41.93]For saving my life, I mean.
[23:44.07]Next time, Mr. Marston, I strongly recommend you don't try to lose it quite so earnestly.
[23:49.38]I'll bear that in mind.
[23:54.83]Yeah, remember how I made that joke about how I don't have a mixer?
[23:56.85]Well, I like have to get one because right now I'm at 100 microphone.
[24:02.41]It's as high as it can possibly go.
[24:03.91]And I have a Scarlett Solo.
[24:05.57]Don't buy one of these ever in your whole life.
[24:08.49]Because it doesn't matter where the setting is.
[24:11.85]It's either going to be way too quiet or you just heard that.
[24:14.26]That was me turning the knob not even like a quarter of a millimeter to the right.
[24:20.20]Don't ever buy a Scarlett Solo in your whole life.
[24:22.46]Even if somebody gives it to you, just fucking break it in front of them.
[24:26.11]Anyways.
[24:28.27]Uh, let's go.
[24:30.17]I didn't- Okay, I was busy like talking shit about something.
[24:32.39]I guess I gotta go over here.
[24:34.57]Is there a melee button in this game?
[24:36.03]Oh, there's a jump.
[24:36.61]Nice!
[24:36.85]Fucking sick jump button!
[24:42.49]Is there like a snap neck in this game?
[24:45.19]Oh, there's- I didn't- Okay, there's a push.
[24:48.28]Okay, I didn't know there was a shove.
[24:56.01]What else is there?
[24:56.59]Oh, not that.
[24:57.39]Put the gun away.
[24:57.85]How do I put the gun away?
[24:58.67]Good.
[24:58.97]Got it.
[25:02.33]I'm just trying.
[25:05.73]Alright.
[25:08.73]Oh, this guy wants to fight now.
[25:09.85]How do you punch?
[25:10.51]I don't think that's how you punch.
[25:16.35]I'm kicking this guy's ass with the palms of my hand.
[25:21.71]What's punch?
[25:24.03]Okay, usually punch in this game is like circle of B, but that's just say, how do you do?
[25:28.29]It's only shoving.
[25:30.83]Shove only.
[25:31.55]Alright, we're going over here.
[25:36.00]Gonna jump this fence like fucking parkour pro.
[25:37.78]Yeah, cool.
[25:39.00]I'm still getting chased by this guy.
[25:42.66]This'll make you get the fuck away from me.
[25:50.79]Wait, pushing people isn't against the law?
[25:54.05]Shooting them is?
[25:55.29]Where's your line?
[25:56.13]How do you punch?
[26:02.15]Join Bonnie.
[26:02.71]Alright.
[26:03.37]I really... Bonnie's the... Bonnie is like the... What is that thing?
[26:09.51]It's a certain blip.
[26:10.45]It's a very specific blip.
[26:11.67]What is it?
[26:12.09]It's going to drive me crazy.
[26:13.92]Oh my god, I have it.
[26:14.70]It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[26:15.82]It's a... Oh, god damn it.
[26:18.14]I don't know.
[26:19.18]It's one of those things.
[26:19.98]You know those candy strips of paper with dots on it?
[26:22.50]Equip my gloves.
[26:28.58]Oh, I have a knife.
[26:32.29]No, I can't... I realize I shouldn't be doing this.
[26:35.89]Should I?
[26:36.19]I'm just trying to show off my knife skills.
[26:43.87]Alright, let's go.
[26:49.04]Don't give me a knife.
[26:49.92]I know it's a really bad idea for me to get a knife right now.
[26:55.61]Come on, let's go.
[26:57.97]Shopping and murder are the same thing.
[27:03.04]That's good to know.
[27:06.12]Dipping dots?
[27:06.92]No, it's like the candy paper, but that's not what that blip is.
[27:09.72]Alright, let's go.
[27:10.46]LB is quick equip, just like every GTA game.
[27:24.04]I mean, this isn't a GTA game, but yeah.
[27:27.68]Let's match her speed.
[27:29.42]And let's get a long conversation about the town's history.
[27:32.28]What do you say?
[27:34.24]Hey, Funky Berlin, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[27:39.37]I think I'll pay my debts to you before I start spending any more money.
[27:45.01]General store.
[27:46.99]Look at the store.
[27:49.93]Nice looking store.
[27:50.67]They got hardware.
[27:51.41]They got software.
[27:53.20]What's wrong with me?
[27:55.11]This is our horse corral.
[27:56.35]Paul's very proud of it.
[27:58.13]I can see why.
[27:59.21]You should watch us break the Broncos sometime.
[28:01.52]I'm sure as a city man, I find it fascinating.
[28:05.20]I'm sure he would.
[28:07.60]I do have like the game of the year edition too.
[28:09.16]So I have like the undead nightmare.
[28:10.82]Whether or not I get to that or not is... There's the train station up ahead.
[28:17.85]No, I'm not shooting it.
[28:19.03]I want to get past this.
[28:19.99]You'd think.
[28:20.71]But the railway's done more harm to us than good.
[28:24.68]Only 90s kids will remember Kyle.
[28:27.90]What are you doing?
[28:31.30]Where are you taking us?
[28:34.52]Okay, this lady's a fucking moron.
[28:37.76]She took us in the worst possible route.
[28:40.07]We could have just turned around.
[28:42.47]Where are you going?
[28:44.87]Oh, my fucking God.
[28:46.81]Oh, shit.
[28:55.83]What?
[28:57.91]The train broke the pattern.
[29:00.07]No, don't jump over this.
[29:02.96]Get back over there.
[29:05.16]Oh my god, now I'm gonna be stuck over here.
[29:09.26]I blame the fucking drunk lady.
[29:13.04]Alright, back it up.
[29:13.94]Let's do a jump.
[29:14.64]Come on.
[29:15.52]Look at that.
[29:16.92]Got it.
[29:17.39]We're good.
[29:19.89]Okay, show me what you got.
[29:24.86]This train's not going to start back up again, is it?
[29:32.66]Was that a turkey?
[29:33.92]That was a huge turkey.
[29:34.96]Yeah.
[29:35.46]I do like the horseback riding.
[29:37.36]It's funny.
[29:38.10]Goddammit, I was going to do it.
[29:56.39]No, no, that's her horse.
[29:58.42]Alright, well, whatever.
[29:58.98]I'm going to ride a horse to the Hitching Forest.
[30:01.00]There it is.
[30:03.42]Press X when near a Hitching... Okay, so I have to hit X. There we go.
[30:06.82]Well, this is my horse now, right?
[30:08.76]Alright, let's go to Bonnie's house.
[30:19.11]What's like push punch?
[30:19.67]Is there punch people in the face in this game?
[30:21.37]Sprint puncher.
[30:21.93]Rad.
[30:44.00]Nice, nice, nice.
[30:44.62]Gonna have a bot fight in this game?
[30:45.72]Best game ever.
[30:46.10]Hmm.
[30:46.18]I can tell I'm gonna really enjoy this.
[31:12.53]I love the slide, that was amazing.
[31:22.09]Alright, how do you punch?
[31:29.61]Okay, that's like how I- you can punch like that.
[31:36.60]I can't like- trying to like lock on or something.
[31:44.57]She's like punching this horse in the face.
[31:54.43]Alright, I had to test it.
[31:57.61]Alright, so I don't think I can running punch.
[32:01.88]This isn't Dark Souls.
[32:04.04]No, it's not.
[32:12.04]I need to get the right weapon out here.
[32:13.88]Tell me the story.
[32:18.15]Take a time out.
[32:30.27]You're surprised how many people never played this game.
[32:31.79]Well, I can give you the reason why.
[32:33.51]I said it earlier, but now that there's, you know, people are here and they're wondering how I've never played this game before.
[32:40.85]This is like the era of Xbox that I didn't have an Xbox 360.
[32:44.37]And I transitioned fully to PC gaming in like 2009, 2010.
[32:54.66]So there was just no way I could have played it.
[32:57.00]I didn't have access to an Xbox.
[32:58.14]This wasn't on, like, PlayStation, like, 4.
[32:59.84]Bitch.
[33:03.65]Get off!
[33:04.19]Get off!
[33:05.37]Oh my god, we're shooting bunnies?
[33:06.95]Okay.
[33:16.20]Cool.
[33:21.00]We're just shooting rabbits.
[33:23.59]How do you, uh, reload?
[33:28.76]Yeah, I never had a PS3, though.
[33:30.36]So, like, I just didn't own a console that was capable of playing it and never came to PC.
[33:40.13]Reload.
[33:43.45]I love how I actually took her horse.
[33:45.25]Alright, we're good.
[33:55.70]It's not the wrestlers stealing our cattle, it's the rabbits stealing our crops.
[33:59.92]It ain't never easy living off the land like this.
[34:02.02]Match your speed, dude.
[34:02.74]Maybe you should move to a big city.
[34:04.52]Become a lady of leisure.
[34:08.08]Come on.
[34:08.46]Move to the speed match.
[34:09.36]Damn coyotes, you're back.
[34:10.56]Oh, God.
[34:11.00]We can't afford to lose anymore livestock.
[34:13.30]Kill him, Mr. Marston.
[34:18.76]Marston's actually a Deadeye.
[34:21.36]Oh, God.
[34:21.92]There's like a slow mo in this game.
[34:25.77]Okay, that's crazy.
[34:29.88]Don't give me a slow-mo.
[34:31.68]Oh man, this is... I can already tell.
[34:40.65]Boink.
[34:42.49]Boink.
[34:45.49]That's good.
[34:47.19]That's gonna help out a lot.
[34:58.64]we stole a chicken but you didn't get out looks like that was the last of the coyotes just a shame we had to lose any of the chickens I'll take you back to your room oh yeah take me back to my room nice
[35:14.18]With no post haste.
[35:15.08]100% auto.
[35:15.64]I'm going to get the bat in because a chicken died.
[35:17.20]Red Dead.
[35:42.42]Get your whores out of hitching posts.
[35:44.98]You got it.
[35:50.44]Patrolling ranch for raiders, shooting animals.
[35:52.52]I know, right?
[35:52.84]Alright.
[35:53.00]You can sleep in the bed in your room to save your game.
[35:54.30]Thank God.
[35:54.90]If you sleep, you'll wake up six hours later.
[36:14.52]You can also pick up extra ammo from the trunk in your room.
[36:18.22]Mm-hmm.
[36:24.74]Hooray!
[36:28.36]General stores, doctors, and gunsmiths will tell you to buy new weapons or stock in them.
[36:31.77]Okay, cool.
[36:34.79]Some people even deal in valuable information about surroundings in the form of maps or cheeseburgers, newspapers.
[36:41.43]Newspapers, okay.
[36:42.43]Well, save the game.
[36:48.57]Save it.
[36:49.53]Yes, I'm sure.
[36:50.45]Please save video game.
[36:51.83]Thank you.
[36:54.13]Go to B on your map to speak with Bonnie McFarlane.
[36:55.97]Okay, so there's my first contact, right?
[37:00.42]What do we got?
[37:00.86]Any new outfits?
[37:02.96]Typical bounty hunter.
[37:05.08]The rest of these are unlockables.
[37:06.36]Okay.
[37:06.68]Whatever.
[37:07.22]Let's go.
[37:11.88]Alright.
[37:14.46]Nope.
[37:14.66]Put the gun away.
[37:17.12]Let's just expedite the beginning process.
[37:25.31]So we can just get into the meat and potatoes of the video game.
[37:30.29]The Discord is currently screwed up.
[37:34.20]Oh, Mr. Marston.
[37:35.88]How are you doing today?
[37:38.24]I'm well, Mr. Farley.
[37:38.70]Thank you.
[37:39.26]How are you?
[37:40.18]Well, I'm fine.
[37:41.54]Thank you.
[37:42.78]So, uh, how are your ribs?
[37:44.70]Fine.
[37:45.08]A little sore, but apart from a couple extra scars, it'll be as nothing happened.
[37:49.46]Good.
[37:49.96]Come in, come in.
[37:52.44]You know, you never did tell me how you met that Bill Williamson or what you wanted from him.
[37:59.08]No, miss, I did not.
[38:01.04]Well, why not, if you don't mind me asking?
[38:04.52]I certainly don't mind you asking if you don't mind me not telling.
[38:08.50]See, it's a complicated and somewhat pathetic tale, and by telling you, not only would I be putting your life in danger, but also threatening the lives of some people that I hold very dear.
[38:18.80]You know where I got these scars?
[38:20.04]I apologize if I seem to be prying.
[38:21.98]Fucking funny one.
[38:23.17]And I apologize for my reticence.
[38:26.01]Hope you believe me when I say that it's simply out of respect for you.
[38:29.45]Of course, Mr. Marston.
[38:31.69]I understand that a city dweller such as yourself likes to have some exotic secrets, so us country folk are impressed.
[38:38.49]I knew it was a bad joke.
[38:39.83]That's why I said it.
[38:40.49]I'm no city man, miss.
[38:41.59]You want a worse joke?
[38:42.29]Yeah, but I saw you get on the train at Blackwater.
[38:45.11]You with those gentlemen in bowler hats?
[38:47.77]I'm still no city man.
[38:49.19]This guy owns a lot of cats.
[38:49.95]Better that you can't ride, Mr. Marston.
[38:52.30]I'm just a city man, sorry.
[38:53.28]My little cat, Pickles, was scratching the shit out of me earlier.
[38:55.46]She's a beautiful cat, though.
[38:56.62]789.
[38:56.66]How do you ride?
[38:57.74]Can I jump and fall down like in GTA?
[39:17.65]Oh, no, I have to race.
[39:19.01]No.
[39:20.55]Oh, God, no.
[39:22.21]Don't make me do a race.
[39:23.62]Ah, shit.
[39:25.58]It's over.
[39:27.08]I'm not gonna ever get by this.
[39:29.80]Didn't give me very much time.
[39:32.56]Oh, we're going fast.
[39:48.11]Follow me!
[39:48.67]Do I have to run through the fire?
[39:52.81]Yes.
[39:53.77]I'll catch you, just you wait!
[40:00.04]Let's go!
[40:00.24]I'm pretty far ahead of her right now.
[40:01.42]Should I wait for you to catch up?
[40:03.40]Did I get it?
[40:07.56]Are you saving the best for last?
[40:09.82]I guess, yeah.
[40:13.46]Let's go!
[40:14.50]Don't you like me to slow down?
[40:16.04]I'm like one of those people.
[40:18.35]That will fly off the screen.
[40:20.97]Oh, fuck!
[40:21.63]No, don't let her win.
[40:26.25]Oh god, I'm gonna lose this race.
[40:30.98]Come on!
[40:31.30]Come on, really?
[40:55.09]I didn't know that happened.
[41:00.79]Like, is this gonna, like, is she gonna let me... God.
[41:03.85]I hate this shit.
[41:04.61]I hated this in the other GTA games.
[41:06.13]I'm just barely getting used to how to fuck... I'm gonna catch up with her.
[41:10.48]She's, like, right there.
[41:14.66]I actually might catch up with her if I do this right.
[41:24.84]No, she's too far away.
[41:27.38]Should I just like restart this fucking thing?
[41:31.44]I might as well restart.
[41:32.40]It's overplayed.
[41:33.40]Damn.
[41:37.58]I would have been like, fine to- I can't fucking- I'm gonna retry that one.
[41:43.85]I'm gonna retry this checkpoint.
[41:48.94]Let's just go back and let's fucking do it again.
[41:50.62]Yeah, alright, 3, 2, 1, here we go!
[41:55.23]Where is she?
[41:56.93]I'm just gonna do this correct.
[42:15.06]I just have to wait for her to go by me and then sprint back.
[42:18.33]I bet you're starting to regret your brave words, Miss McFarlane.
[42:23.21]Just don't let her get in front of you.
[42:26.77]That's all that matters.
[42:35.45]That's fine.
[42:35.96]It's alright.
[42:36.92]I have got you now!
[42:45.07]neck and neck, Miss McFarlane!
[42:49.55]Yeah!
[42:51.79]This sure beats milking cows!
[42:54.29]It sure does.
[42:58.11]That's more like it!
[43:00.71]There's a lot of twists and turns here.
[43:04.30]Don't go easy on me!
[43:08.50]Let's go!
[43:09.56]Right up her ass.
[43:10.20]You're not as bad as I thought you'd be!
[43:17.69]She keeps, like, pushing me off the road.
[43:21.47]Fucking hell.
[43:24.39]She's gonna, like, fucking beat me.
[43:32.13]It's okay, actually.
[43:47.68]God damn it, I- I- I'm gonna get thrown off again!
[43:56.08]How long is this race?!
[43:57.14]I'm gonna lose.
[44:04.33]Come on!
[44:12.95]Come on, there's the smoke!
[44:20.56]Try to stay with me now!
[44:22.92]Alright, we're good.
[44:25.73]I win.
[44:26.03]Let's go, Miss McFarlane!
[44:31.11]There it is.
[44:31.61]There's a victory.
[44:34.65]Okay, we win.
[44:35.69]Wait, what?
[44:36.43]Oh, okay.
[44:37.39]Let's go.
[44:46.04]That was fun.
[44:49.37]You know, you should go pay the Marshal a visit.
[44:51.77]I don't do well on those.
[44:53.63]I'm sure he could help you deal with that nice Mr. Williamson.
[44:57.35]Hey, nicely done.
[44:58.79]I love how PogChamps in my stream... We get PogChamps for completing a tutorial race.
[45:08.00]Think about that.
[45:08.60]Hey, that was a pretty good joke I just made.
[45:12.20]Plus 20.
[45:15.36]Travel to the M on the map.
[45:16.36]Okay, so should we...
[45:20.54]What do you think?
[45:21.00]More Bonnie or more BRM?
[45:25.34]We have low expectations.
[45:29.28]Let's go take a look in here.
[45:35.81]Oh, there's a candy place!
[45:37.61]I fucking love these places where you get to fill the bag with candy, different candies.
[45:40.79]I mean, the selection's not that great.
[45:44.88]All they have is yellow.
[45:46.78]Oh, fuck.
[45:47.00]Wow.
[45:48.82]They have popcorn jelly belly.
[45:51.40]And black raspberry jelly belly.
[45:53.50]And they got like extra large jolly ranches.
[45:57.40]That's all they got.
[46:02.59]Let's see.
[46:03.53]Alright, what do I have for money?
[46:09.11]Survivalist map?
[46:10.81]I have no money, so I can't do anything.
[46:12.49]Can I... If I shoot this guy, is he permanently dead?
[46:19.63]Can I rob the register?
[46:24.66]Can I just take money out of register?
[46:29.54]No, I don't want to pull the gun out.
[46:32.83]Not a good idea.
[46:33.25]No, I feel like that's going to last a long time.
[46:35.33]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[46:47.95]I didn't know.
[46:48.99]Wait, there's like a wanted thing?
[46:50.73]Wait, wait.
[46:52.55]Oh shit.
[46:57.11]Who the fuck is this guy?
[46:58.95]What have I done wrong?
[47:03.13]Is that the sheriff?
[47:05.75]I think I just killed the sheriff.
[47:07.57]Oh fuck.
[47:09.11]Not a good idea.
[47:09.67]Not good.
[47:10.37]I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[47:13.11]God.
[47:13.61]Four dollars.
[47:16.62]Fucking four dollars, that's great.
[47:22.16]Are you sure you own that horse?
[47:25.70]I didn't know that there was like a system, like a wanted thing in this game.
[47:29.12]Geez, now I have to run all the way down here.
[47:45.31]I didn't see the edge of that cliff.
[47:46.71]I thought that was like a small dip.
[47:48.05]Hi.
[48:14.32]Yeah, the Elgato HD Pro crashed a blue screen to my computer again.
[48:18.48]If you're curious.
[48:25.14]So I have to use the other one, my external capture card, which is a piece of shit as well.
[48:35.17]Don't you guys love it when products that you buy that are fucking hundreds of dollars work the way they're supposed to?
[48:42.01]Don't you guys like that?
[48:44.30]Don't you guys like that, like, literally, like, a product that's, like, fucking 300 bucks, like, sucks and doesn't work?
[48:50.96]And breaks your computer?
[48:53.22]I love when that happens.
[48:54.90]Especially when it's El Gato, the company El Gato.
[48:58.38]They do a really great job.
[49:00.86]No, they don't, at all. ...
[49:14.50]I hope me switching out to my external capture card.
[49:18.14]There's going to be some audio delay issues, unfortunately, because, you know, it's an external card and there's nothing I can do about it.
[49:25.34]So hopefully, I don't know.
[49:26.42]You guys tell me if it's like out of sync.
[49:28.44]I'm going to have to try to fix it.
[49:32.22]Let's see.
[49:33.24]I'm not going to get off the horse right now.
[49:34.50]I'm not going to like jump.
[49:36.32]Ready?
[49:36.52]Like jump.
[49:38.48]Whoa, cool.
[49:39.64]Jump.
[49:40.82]Are we, like, in sync?
[49:41.52]I didn't have very much time to test it.
[49:43.58]So.
[49:44.78]You're gonna have to let me know.
[49:48.16]If it's, like, in sync or not.
[49:49.18]Because that's what I was doing.
[49:53.66]It's loud?
[49:54.16]Alright, I'll turn that down.
[49:55.06]Alright.
[49:57.94]It's okay, yep.
[49:58.78]Shoot the gun.
[49:59.30]Let's see.
[50:00.82]Okay, I'm gonna shoot the gun.
[50:03.22]Bang!
[50:03.42]Okay, I'm gonna shoot this, like, eagle out of the air.
[50:11.76]No, I'm not.
[50:12.86]Alright.
[50:15.14]Shoot the horse.
[50:15.88]No, I'm not going to shoot the horse.
[50:17.14]So we're good?
[50:18.99]Good enough?
[50:19.41]A little bit?
[50:20.81]I have nothing I can do about it.
[50:22.47]It's off by how much?
[50:23.79]I don't know by how much.
[50:26.67]I'm going to see.
[50:27.31]I'm going to see my own screen.
[50:28.41]Let's see.
[50:28.71]Here we go.
[50:30.15]Like, BAM!
[50:30.91]Now I have to watch myself.
[50:35.13]Here we go.
[50:39.32]Like, BAM!
[50:43.43]It's off by a little bit.
[50:44.59]It's alright, though.
[50:45.29]Alright, well, let's just keep going.
[50:58.94]Callback to sorcery.
[51:00.04]It's .25 milliseconds.
[51:01.59]It's alright.
[51:03.65]You just might hear me react to something a quarter of a second as it's happening, so I'm sorry.
[51:11.56]Fucking technical bullshit, man.
[51:13.40]I swear to God.
[51:14.91]Alright, we're not gonna sit here and cry over milk that was spilled.
[51:17.35]Like, I, I, okay, here's what happened.
[51:18.63]I spilled a bunch of milk.
[51:20.53]And then I, like, I spilled a bunch of milk on the counter.
[51:24.17]And I took my hand, and I dragged it, like, across the counter in the milk, and I held the cup out, and I put the milk back in the cup.
[51:31.39]This milk is not gonna be good.
[51:32.35]I'm gonna drink the milk, though.
[51:36.43]It's still milk.
[51:38.41]But, gross.
[51:42.85]Let me just put this over here.
[51:47.61]And see if we can gain back the, like, 1,400 people we lost.
[51:53.94]Fuck me.
[51:55.34]Whatever, let's go.
[51:56.30]Hi, guys.
[51:57.54]Hey, welcome to Red Dead Redempted.
[52:00.18]Computers work.
[52:01.44]They're really good.
[52:03.54]I love computers, don't you?
[52:04.74]Who doesn't love a good computer?
[52:09.71]Anyways, I'm plugging this in.
[52:13.56]Let's go.
[52:13.88]Let's do it.
[52:17.33]What was I doing?
[52:17.83]I was going to somebody's house.
[52:20.61]Oh, I gotta make, like, a tweet just telling everybody, like, back from blue screen we're still alive.
[52:24.39]So people will, like, know.
[52:25.83]I'm not sure.
[52:27.89]Should I retweet my tweet I did from, like, fucking 45 minutes ago?
[52:35.33]Bear with me here, guys.
[52:40.58]Back from the blue screen.
[52:48.34]Let's go.
[52:50.74]Half-time the blue screen.
[52:52.25]What?
[52:52.65]Fuck you, autocorrect.
[52:53.69]Fuck Apple.
[52:57.33]Back from the blue screen.
[52:58.27]Let's go.
[53:04.05]Don't you just... Anybody else get as irritated as I do about stuff like this?
[53:09.66]And you just expect that when you buy something that's a lot of money, that it's gonna work.
[53:16.72]You know?
[53:18.44]Like, I just expect that, like, shit's not gonna fucking work.
[53:22.00]Like, that it's gonna work.
[53:24.52]Like, why doesn't shit just fucking work?
[53:27.30]Fuck all companies.
[53:33.22]No, there are some good companies.
[53:36.60]Hold on, sorry.
[53:39.25]I just, like, instantly came back from the blue screen and, like, pressed stream.
[53:43.02]Like, so... Alright, yes, I mean, I expect it.
[53:52.12]When I buy a product... Look, if a product's, like, 20 bucks or something, whatever.
[53:57.34]But when shit is that much... Wait, what are we doing?
[54:04.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, back up, back the horse up, back the fucking horse up!
[54:30.03]Alright.
[54:31.20]Let's hit the fucking restart button on this whole thing.
[54:36.44]Here we go.
[54:37.54]Hi Jeremy, stream is working.
[54:43.44]Hopefully it is.
[54:47.16]It's like reading a Dark Souls message telling you to jump in a hole.
[54:54.63]Fucking thing sucks.
[55:00.11]Should I be picking up the herbs and stuff?
[55:02.51]Can you crash?
[55:03.09]I guess not really.
[55:08.92]Stressed streamer.
[55:11.62]Red Dead take two, take two.
[55:13.44]I really should change it to that.
[55:16.44]I swear to god if I blue screen again, I'm going to have a fucking meltdown.
[55:20.58]Can I like
[55:28.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:30.20]Easy, buddy.
[55:31.10]I was about to just cut across this.
[55:35.46]It's not a car.
[55:36.42]It's not like GTA.
[55:37.58]It's not a fucking car.
[55:39.60]I keep treating the horse like it's a car.
[55:48.82]It is in fact not a car.
[55:53.35]These guys are going to hold the town over, huh?
[55:57.17]It's not Skyrim.
[56:06.85]The mini-map is not very useful.
[56:11.37]It doesn't seem like it is.
[56:12.77]It looks like a Google map.
[56:14.09]I'm like racing this dude right now.
[56:23.58]Okay.
[56:25.98]You can't hit people with horses?
[56:27.02]Okay, let's get down.
[56:33.21]A horse is not a car.
[56:34.29]That is true.
[56:34.89]A horse is not a car.
[56:41.29]Just keep the speed.
[56:45.29]Blue dead, Red Dead Redemption.
[56:47.19]Yeah, I'm sorry guys.
[56:49.07]I wish... This always happens when I try to capture a console.
[56:55.69]And I tried to circumvent that.
[56:57.33]I bought this new computer with a fucking internal capture card.
[57:02.30]And it just don't fucking matter.
[57:04.18]Everything always sucks.
[57:05.50]Just never forget that.
[57:08.10]Everything just sucks always.
[57:10.30]You have to make your own way.
[57:12.34]Make your own way.
[57:13.54]That's what I'm trying to say.
[57:14.34]Anyways, thank you Moomin's Moo for the five bucks.
[57:20.06]Also, thank you Gummy Monk for the ten bucks.
[57:21.56]That was gross.
[57:23.80]My name's John Marston.
[57:24.88]You wanted to speak to me.
[57:39.49]I did?
[57:39.89]Apparently so.
[57:43.52]Why?
[57:45.26]I guess because we're both in the business of the law.
[57:52.40]Can that guy just walk out of his cell?
[57:54.48]Yeah, he can.
[57:56.82]You that fella from the train company?
[58:00.08]No, I'm from Fort Mercer.
[58:02.44]Fort Mercer?
[58:04.55]Why does he just let them bunk around?
[58:06.39]Okay.
[58:32.86]You must be the man from Blackwater.
[58:35.89]Yes, sir.
[58:36.95]Yes.
[58:37.45]Listen, that dog ain't too bright.
[58:39.55]Dog?
[58:40.23]But he seems loyal.
[58:41.93]Jonah, get out of here for a minute.
[58:45.03]Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson, sir.
[58:49.87]And you.
[58:51.51]Oh, I done seen enough of your hide around here, friend.
[58:56.57]I think there's some schoolchildren down the way you can go and frighten.
[58:59.75]Oh, hardy fucking har.
[59:03.40]What are you doing here, Mr. Marston?
[59:04.34]How's it going?
[59:05.05]It's going okay.
[59:05.57]Apart from frightening my deputies.
[59:08.41]The sound is off.
[59:08.89]I wish I could do something about it right now.
[59:10.81]Are you here to capture or kill Bill Williamson?
[59:17.11]Okay.
[59:18.53]Can you help me?
[59:19.95]Maybe I might be able to do this.
[59:20.97]He's outside my jurisdiction.
[59:22.39]He's in the next county.
[59:27.59]Of course, Bill Williamson and his boys have tended to keep themselves away from my town.
[59:33.04]So you're happy to have him out there?
[59:34.84]I ain't happy, but I also ain't suicidal.
[59:38.48]My job is to keep this town safe, not clean up all of these three counties.
[59:42.62]It's hard enough around here.
[59:44.18]You know, I hear you speak, and suddenly I'm reminded of how some of the people I respected most of my life had a problem with authority.
[59:53.15]What's wrong with you?
[59:55.51]Well, I'm sure you and your fine friends have enjoyed spending your time running around pursuing noble causes.
[60:03.77]My cause is to keep this town from turning into a living hell for the folks who live here.
[60:10.17]Whole world has problems, mister.
[60:12.44]And I'm here doing what I can.
[60:15.78]The acting is very good though.
[60:16.94]I will say that.
[60:20.00]I got the railway, the people who pay my salary trying to get me to turn a blind eye to them burning down settlements up there.
[60:25.24]Very realistic.
[60:26.06]I got a bunch of cattle rustlers out near Box Canyon needs shutting down.
[60:29.72]Not forgetting the gang that keeps murdering homesteaders out in the back country.
[60:34.05]And I got a bunch of hoods over in the saloon, drunk, threatening to shoot up the whole town.
[60:38.93]That's all I got today.
[60:40.35]That's really it.
[60:40.85]Texas is still like this.
[60:41.49]Give me a couple more days, there'll be more.
[60:44.46]Alright, tell you what.
[60:51.29]Let's go deal with them hoods in the saloon.
[60:53.89]Alright, we're gonna do some saloon fighting.
[60:56.25]Then we'll discuss Williamson.
[61:00.24]Okay, boy.
[61:04.92]You're persistent, little cuss, ain't you?
[61:07.66]Only when things matter.
[61:08.74]Alright, nice.
[61:13.53]How did my hat get scarred?
[61:14.37]The saloon's this way.
[61:16.75]Company Marshal Johnson to the saloon.
[61:20.73]I hear some roughhousing going on in there.
[61:23.77]So who are we looking for?
[61:24.67]A bunch of two-bit hoodlums, led by this fella called Walt.
[61:29.09]Goddamn road agents who prey on the stages coming in and out of town.
[61:33.19]Drivers in armadillos spend more time with their hands in the air than on the reins these days.
[61:38.15]And you're happy to let them drink in your saloon?
[61:40.68]Happy?
[61:41.32]No.
[61:42.18]But the way I figure it, better they're carousing in there than out robbing decent folk.
[61:46.70]Here we are.
[61:47.18]That's an interesting approach.
[61:48.46]So should I not shoot people in here?
[61:50.30]Or should I just rough them up?
[61:53.06]This guy.
[61:55.06]This is the guy we gotta get.
[61:57.94]Why don't we just get him?
[62:01.06]He's such a typical pompous asshole, too.
[62:03.91]As long as it's alive, your horse will come to you.
[62:10.47]Wait, wait, wait.
[62:11.15]Who spotted me?
[62:19.76]What?
[62:21.00]How did I get seen?
[62:22.04]We're like whistled for our horses.
[62:23.54]Apparently he already saw us.
[62:30.35]If Walton's as bad as you say he is, why don't we just beef him now while we got the chance?
[62:34.85]Look out, he whistled.
[62:36.09]That was probably a bad move.
[62:37.31]Is that right, Marshal?
[62:38.68]And alive, he can still talk.
[62:41.24]Doesn't sound like he's a man to be reasoned with.
[62:43.74]He ain't.
[62:44.56]But a few days of my hospitality and he'll be telling me what I need to know.
[62:48.32]Walton's gang's been growing fast.
[62:50.60]Outlawing's easy money for easy work.
[62:53.32]Capture or kill?
[62:54.16]There's a lot of capture or kill in this game.
[62:55.62]These boys get around.
[62:57.19]Wallum's a start, but there's plenty more where he can come from.
[63:00.09]Here comes Acid Face.
[63:03.65]It really is Acid Face.
[63:08.75]Dibbles!
[63:09.37]That's so perfect.
[63:21.18]Hold up, Marshal.
[63:22.22]He must be at the old Pleasant's house.
[63:24.28]Probably best we take it on foot from here.
[63:32.91]Western to acid base.
[63:39.68]Uh-oh.
[63:42.44]Watch out, watch out.
[63:43.08]These are the fucking inhabitants of Old Yharnam before the fucking blood took over.
[63:46.56]Press to enter and exit the cover.
[63:53.74]Okay.
[64:03.33]Right in the fucking head.
[64:04.22]Please reload, cool.
[64:08.78]Cover me.
[64:09.22]You're up in the crate.
[64:10.20]You got it.
[64:17.71]Nice.
[64:19.11]Ooh, the shooting is fun.
[64:20.63]He's even fought over by...
[64:28.59]And the blind fire weapon for just hit L.
[64:40.59]Right trigger is not shooting. Shouldn't it be right trigger?
[64:48.59]Uh okay, I can't shoot from here.
[64:53.68]Alright. We could do yeah yeah yeah.
[65:00.30]Now I can blind fire.
[65:06.76]Let's go.
[65:08.84]Can I vault over this?
[65:09.34]Up here.
[65:17.64]That was cool.
[65:27.58]Where'd he go?
[65:30.84]Where is he?
[65:32.00]Oh, there he is.
[65:37.72]Just Walton left now.
[65:38.99]Just Walton.
[65:39.59]Try to take him alive.
[65:41.81]Alright.
[65:42.23]Oh, I thought that.
[65:42.93]Okay.
[65:43.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[65:44.07]Why am I here?
[65:46.25]Shoot him in the legs.
[65:47.51]Hey, hey.
[65:48.03]Oh, I shot him in the... Alright.
[65:50.10]Well, I shot him in the penis.
[65:56.78]That's a good way to take somebody out.
[65:58.34]Why don't you check in with me next time you're in town?
[66:01.62]I don't want to be no policeman, Marshall.
[66:03.78]Nor did I, my friend.
[66:04.74]I can promise you that.
[66:06.16]I'll see you soon, Mr. Marshall.
[66:07.75]Wait, he's dead?
[66:10.43]No, he's not.
[66:11.01]What?
[66:11.53]Hold on.
[66:13.23]Wait a minute.
[66:15.85]I didn't kill him, right?
[66:21.41]Okay.
[66:22.33]Four dollars.
[66:27.79]Let's loot some bodies.
[66:32.07]75.
[66:32.19]Plus 75.
[66:32.65]Nice.
[66:36.08]Dishonorable people react positively if you have low honor.
[66:38.86]Honorable people react negatively to low honor.
[66:41.18]Okay.
[66:41.40]Do I have anything?
[66:46.82]$24.
[66:46.94]That guy had 5 bucks.
[66:47.93]That guy had more money than the mission was worth.
[66:50.73]Seems a little odd.
[66:51.29]What about inside the house?
[66:53.79]Anything?
[66:57.23]Marshall left you a long way from civilization.
[66:59.21]You can quickly travel back to town using the travel to destination feature of your camp.
[67:04.05]Open your satchel with that button.
[67:06.45]And, okay.
[67:11.30]Oh, wait, what?
[67:17.64]I don't, there is no, that button doesn't exist.
[67:19.88]Is this the right, is this what I'm doing?
[67:24.85]Um, is that, oh, there's a chest in here.
[67:30.46]What is it?
[67:32.34]36 bucks.
[67:33.00]Nice.
[67:33.22]I mean, that's good.
[67:38.88]Well, is it like just random chests around the whole world?
[67:41.60]Okay, so how do I get into my like... That gave me a button that doesn't exist.
[67:50.37]Is that start?
[67:53.61]Can I just fast travel?
[67:58.56]That's waypoint.
[68:04.23]How do I fast travel?
[68:05.11]What did I just do?
[68:16.84]You can fast travel to any inhabited location you have discovered.
[68:19.05]Otherwise, you can place a waypoint anywhere on the territory map and then travel to the nearest road.
[68:23.21]Okay.
[68:23.43]You can save at a fire, too.
[68:27.23]Okay, that's cool.
[68:31.48]Uh, travel to McFarland Ranch.
[68:33.01]Travel to Waypoint.
[68:33.77]Where do I want to go?
[68:34.39]McFarland Ranch?
[68:35.21]I think I just want to go back here.
[68:45.61]Am I standing in the fire?
[68:46.70]Okay, I thought I was about to stand in the fire.
[68:49.34]And that was going to, like, teleport me.
[68:58.20]Did I go the wrong way?
[69:02.39]I think I may have gone the wrong way.
[69:04.17]Let me look at the map again.
[69:14.72]What's a quick way to get to the map?
[69:17.50]Yeah, I went the wrong way.
[69:18.52]Okay, whatever, I'll just do it.
[69:22.36]Poker's available to play now.
[69:23.46]I don't think I can do this.
[69:26.73]Yeah, I can do the Bonnie mission.
[69:30.45]Yeah, I'll do that.
[69:33.78]Go get the war horse?
[69:34.96]What do you mean, war horse?
[69:44.41]Get the lasso.
[69:45.99]Start lassoing people.
[69:52.45]Check back between 5 a.m.
[69:53.53]and 6 p.m.
[69:54.25]I can't go here.
[69:58.17]Eat the paper.
[70:00.41]I actually have to like go to bed?
[70:01.61]Is this like a bedtime in this game?
[70:08.33]What?
[70:10.67]Wait, does it search the area with the dog?
[70:21.04]Stop all criminals you encounter by any means necessary before morning with your dog friend.
[70:29.57]Why can he sniff criminals?
[70:32.18]Is this like a drug dog?
[70:33.22]Alright, well, fine.
[70:38.06]I'll stop the criminals with my trusty companion.
[70:51.87]I love that the dog is just like walking around aimlessly.
[70:54.73]Is somebody in the outhouse?
[70:59.91]Is that guy causing trouble?
[71:04.03]Smell him.
[71:07.07]No, he's okay.
[71:09.51]I'm not going to shoot the dog.
[71:11.76]Why would I shoot my dog?
[71:14.68]He's the mission.
[71:15.64]He's currently helping me find the bad guy.
[71:17.32]Maybe not.
[71:21.20]Maybe he's just going to take a shit.
[71:22.83]I have no idea.
[71:23.49]He's just walking around aimlessly.
[71:33.10]Do it for fun.
[71:34.34]No.
[71:35.44]You guys can't make me kill this dog.
[71:38.10]Am I going in this house?
[71:40.70]Who's in here?
[71:41.92]Chests?
[71:42.52]Oh, chest.
[71:48.90]I hope this is not somebody's property.
[71:51.54]Eh.
[71:52.86]It kind of is.
[71:53.46]Where'd the dog go?
[71:55.98]Did you find something?
[71:56.66]Did you smell something?
[71:57.44]He's got something.
[71:59.76]He's got a scent.
[72:06.65]Alright, here we go.
[72:08.21]Break up the fight and capture the criminals.
[72:12.01]Oh, there's a fight going on.
[72:15.37]How do we stop this?
[72:15.98]Alright, I'm going to break this fight up.
[72:27.64]How do I break this up?
[72:33.57]Did I need to get him?
[72:35.71]Oh.
[72:36.25]Let these guys go, they won't be back anytime soon.
[72:38.29]What?
[72:41.15]No, I have to like arrest them, right?
[72:45.78]This guy, this guy's going to jail.
[72:51.44]God damn it.
[72:54.58]Fine.
[72:55.16]Oh, dog.
[72:55.68]Alright, what are we doing?
[72:56.52]We're going back to the sheriff's department.
[73:03.09]Get some money out of that, that's good.
[73:07.19]No shit, no!
[73:08.75]Hey, take three dollars, I'm sorry.
[73:09.97]Okay, we're good.
[73:12.99]Fuck, I just lost 400 honor, oh no.
[73:18.61]I was- Ayayay.
[73:31.55]It's alright.
[73:32.49]Don't worry about it.
[73:33.41]We're good.
[73:33.83]I can get that on- Wait, evil playthrough.
[73:36.59]It's been decided.
[73:41.29]Where's my- Where's Epona?
[73:50.88]Oh, there she is!
[73:58.11]Fuck you, Epona.
[73:58.95]You're the worst character in Zelda.
[74:01.85]I'm just kidding.
[74:07.85]I need to go to bed.
[74:15.39]Slow, slow, slow.
[74:16.72]How do I see what time it is?
[74:17.70]Oh, there's a dog.
[74:22.34]Talking to me?
[74:27.78]Oh, this guy's talking to me.
[74:30.00]Did he just call me a chicken?
[74:32.13]What's up?
[74:33.65]I'm like the night watchman.
[74:35.11]What do you got?
[74:37.11]Did he just spit on me?
[74:39.06]To accept duel challenges, accept the duel.
[74:41.28]I won.
[74:41.66]What?
[74:41.82]Wait, I... That guy fucking just challenged me!
[74:44.40]What the fuck?! !
[75:06.82]Damn it, I keep not paying attention to that shit.
[75:13.63]I keep not paying attention to this stupid fucking stamina.
[75:18.99]Okay, slow down, slow down.
[75:23.30]We're good.
[75:24.58]I'm okay.
[75:27.62]Just gotta wait, wait till it calms down.
[75:32.66]That guy was only $40, apparently.
[75:36.71]Alright, wanted's almost over.
[75:37.95]We're good.
[75:38.41]We can go back to the town.
[75:39.31]Is that how it works?
[75:41.07]Can I go back in here?
[75:41.99]Okay, I'm good.
[75:45.09]Alright, back in the town.
[75:48.29]Chaotic evil.
[75:49.59]I just need to go back to bed.
[75:55.20]I had to press B. I know now.
[76:01.12]I don't know.
[76:01.72]I thought I'd just get rid of that guy.
[76:03.30]He was calling me names.
[76:11.47]Wait, is that guy alive again?
[76:15.77]You have an unpaid bounty on your head from earlier crimes.
[76:18.11]Until you pay it off and clear your name, lawman, everyone's going to hunt you down.
[76:23.56]Train stations across the land have telegraph offices inside.
[76:26.10]Here you can wire money to the courts and clear your name.
[76:29.76]This is fucking oblivion?
[76:35.03]What the fuck?
[76:36.37]Okay.
[76:38.93]I...
[76:43.59]So, uh... Okay, whatever.
[76:49.75]I'm just going to bed.
[76:50.43]I need to do some good deeds.
[76:53.88]Is there an opportunity for a good deed in here?
[76:57.80]Let's see.
[76:58.62]Is there an opportunity for a good deed?
[77:02.38]Oh, this is... Wait, I hear that gunshot.
[77:05.24]You hear that?
[77:08.55]I hear somebody screaming out here.
[77:13.84]Why is there like a revolutionary snare drum playing?
[77:18.06]Fuck, I don't even care, I'm going to bed.
[77:19.57]Fuck this town.
[77:26.49]Save the game.
[77:26.91]Alright.
[77:35.18]Bad deeds are done by the populace and if you turn rogue agent you will find many establishments close their doors to you.
[77:41.56]Rogue agent.
[77:44.20]I have to do some good deeds.
[77:46.00]Let's go to Bonnie.
[77:46.74]Maybe Bonnie can give me some good deeds.
[77:51.18]Let's just see what she has.
[77:52.16]Can I... Should I start, like, saying hello to people and shit?
[78:03.63]Let's go.
[78:06.74]So it's like GTA, but with actual consequences.
[78:09.26]She's going to get in the car?
[78:11.42]Oh, no.
[78:33.49]Get on the wagon.
[78:34.55]Oh, God.
[78:35.28]Don't give me a wagon.
[78:36.82]You're looking much better, considering you were almost buzzard food a couple days ago.
[78:46.41]I have you to thank for that, miss.
[78:49.42]Oh, get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way.
[78:51.70]What are you doing, dog?
[78:52.62]Don't fucking walk in front of my shit.
[78:54.38]Going a little too fast.
[78:55.81]I'm gonna tip this thing.
[78:57.17]It's like driving an SUV in this game.
[79:00.13]What about you?
[79:00.59]Have you ever given up hope all
[79:14.30]All day to maintain speed and be able to work your horse.
[79:16.32]Yeah, I know.
[79:17.00]Oh, here we go.
[79:17.50]Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[79:18.12]Good.
[79:18.60]Bumpy ride.
[79:19.54]Watch out, I'm behind the wheel.
[79:20.53]I know.
[79:45.59]I like the bigger cars.
[79:46.85]I'm going to keep calling them cars because that's all I'm going to say.
[79:50.01]Now they're kind of freaking out.
[79:53.33]Is that person shooting the person in front of them?
[79:55.65]I think they are.
[80:12.98]That is apparently a war horse in my inventory.
[80:15.26]This lady just keeps calling me stupid every chance.
[80:19.10]You're stupid.
[80:20.26]Can I ghost ride this?
[80:22.02]It's worth a shot here, but no, not like that.
[80:43.74]And this will be it here.
[80:44.76]I've already done the mission here, so... I can go back down to it.
[80:48.80]You never did tell me where you live!
[80:50.40]I have a small hold and I'm a great play.
[80:53.43]A farmer?
[80:54.53]Yeah.
[80:55.27]And I'm the queen of England.
[80:57.33]And at what point during your day of hunting down outlaws do you find time to raise chicken?
[81:01.91]That guy got kind of fucking ruined.
[81:04.05]Okay.
[81:05.63]So this is Armadillo.
[81:07.37]Manhattan it is not.
[81:09.13]But it does okay for us.
[81:13.19]Well, good thing I didn't get any bad deed for that one.
[81:15.30]Need some meds?
[81:17.36]Okay.
[81:17.48]Go to the doctor's office and do your thing.
[81:42.60]People are screaming because I knocked over a bucket.
[81:45.64]Easy.
[81:45.98]Slow down, little boy.
[81:46.94]Uh, medicine.
[81:48.14]Free.
[81:48.48]Take it.
[81:49.47]Medicine and other consumable items are stored in your satchel.
[81:52.33]Press that to open up your satchel.
[81:58.99]Yeah, there's medicine.
[82:07.27]Select the item.
[82:07.75]Once an item is selected, you can press A to use it.
[82:10.13]Do I have to use the medicine to, like, test using it?
[82:12.41]I don't think I... Probably not.
[82:17.70]Well, thanks for driving me.
[82:20.02]It was nice to be able to enjoy the view for once.
[82:21.94]Not the town bucket.
[82:22.68]Don't knock that shit over.
[82:25.32]You're more than welcome, miss.
[82:27.48]Least I can do.
[82:29.66]Thank you for the medicine.
[82:31.57]Get the warhorse.
[82:31.93]Alright, I'm gonna use the warhorse.
[82:32.92]What is with the warhorse?
[82:34.32]Like, is it that big of a deal?
[82:35.58]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[82:36.28]I'm gonna pick up the warhorse.
[82:55.61]If you want to leave Armadillo, there are usually stagecoaches loading and unloading behind the freight station, so I can just take a taxi, essentially.
[83:04.83]There we go, get some honor.
[83:07.19]I can now purchase and rent properties.
[83:09.05]Okay, that's cool.
[83:12.74]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[83:14.94]Hey!
[83:16.04]Hey!
[83:17.52]Fuck outta here!
[83:18.70]Yeah, I'll take my good deed!
[83:22.94]Plus 100 deed.
[83:30.36]Money.
[83:31.26]That was a good deed though, right?
[83:37.65]Oh no, here we go.
[83:38.15]I'm gonna loot this guy.
[83:44.73]Kill her and shoot her.
[83:46.41]No.
[83:46.67]Alright, is this property like 90 bucks?
[83:49.25]I mean, I can afford that if it's like 90 dollars.
[83:53.89]How do I, like, look at it?
[84:03.56]Get up here.
[84:09.42]Get over that.
[84:09.96]I wanna, like, look in the window.
[84:15.34]There's no way you saw me through the window!
[84:20.74]Oh, come on.
[84:21.48]I... Alright, note to self, you can't aim guns at people.
[84:27.70]I'm just gonna go to Martin's, whatever his name is.
[84:32.32]Alright, I'm good.
[84:33.66]What is this?
[84:34.98]Strangers found throughout the world are in need of assistance.
[84:36.97]Okay, let's get some good deeds.
[84:38.97]They took my boy!
[84:39.87]My boy!
[84:41.59]Who did?
[84:42.45]He's missing.
[84:43.67]He's only a youngster.
[84:44.67]My boy is missing.
[84:46.62]Where?
[84:47.48]Who took him?
[84:48.04]Oh my god.
[84:48.78]Them people in the hills.
[84:49.92]Them hills near Hanging Rock.
[84:52.20]They took him.
[84:52.76]The horse.
[84:53.92]Hold on.
[84:54.22]Can't the police force help you?
[84:55.84]No.
[84:56.90]They can't even help themselves.
[84:57.79]What's that noise?
[84:58.93]Please, sir.
[85:00.03]My son is missing.
[85:00.91]I need your help.
[85:02.11]What's with the fee-fi-fo-fum that I keep hearing?
[85:03.53]If I find him, I'll bring him back to you.
[85:08.69]Go search for the boy by Hanging Rock.
[85:14.46]Okay.
[85:16.87]Strangers, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[85:18.24]These tasks we started continue to be completed at any time.
[85:24.12]So... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[85:28.00]Check the journal in the pause menu for information concerning each stranger's task.
[85:35.45]Okay.
[85:38.39]Strangers.
[85:41.17]A woman at the Armadillo Shire's office said her son went missing in the hills by hanging rock.
[85:44.73]Go and search for him.
[85:45.69]Okay.
[85:47.60]Sure.
[85:51.78]So this idea of freaks and strangers and geeks and stuff was like ten years before GTA 5.
[85:58.54]Wait, what?
[86:03.87]Purple circle.
[86:06.51]Wait a minute.
[86:08.69]Over here.
[86:09.21]I'm going to do this.
[86:11.33]I want to go do this.
[86:12.81]We're gonna play.
[86:13.89]Let's play.
[86:14.73]I need to... Okay.
[86:15.71]Okay.
[86:16.13]Warhorse.
[86:17.79]Warhorse.
[86:20.81]What does that do?
[86:21.37]What happened?
[86:21.85]Okay.
[86:29.23]Where is he?
[86:29.53]Where's my warhorse?
[86:41.93]There he is.
[86:45.13]Oh, alright.
[86:45.53]Nice war horse.
[86:48.91]Nice.
[86:51.85]This isn't even a war horse.
[86:58.09]Save that good deed for another time.
[87:01.93]Now let's go find the boy.
[87:05.67]And like... Ah, I kind of want the Sherbert horse.
[87:10.16]There's a lot of these, like, horses that are, like, brown and, like, this is a couple of white ones.
[87:15.20]I want the Sherbert one.
[87:17.70]Alright, boy, let's find the boy.
[87:25.97]Kill it.
[87:26.31]I'm not gonna kill.
[87:26.87]This is fast.
[87:28.07]Damn.
[87:35.05]Skills like hunting and sharpening can gain fame and money across the land.
[87:37.77]Yeah, that's cool.
[87:44.37]I tried to jump that rock and that wasn't happening.
[87:46.19]Alright, well then go this way, buddy.
[87:51.08]Shoot birds or skin coyotes.
[87:52.74]Okay.
[87:55.38]Alright, let's find the boy.
[87:57.67]No bad deed will go un... Save the treasure hunter.
[88:02.95]Which one is he?
[88:28.97]I got so close to do that to him, what a psycho.
[88:34.54]Oh my god, that was fucking crazy.
[88:37.85]Yeah, I could shoot him from far away, but let me fucking walk up to him and put the gun under his chin and blow his fucking brains out.
[88:45.04]There's much treasure here.
[88:46.52]You want map?
[88:47.66]I retire.
[88:48.64]Here, take map.
[88:49.92]You earn it.
[88:50.66]I'll happily take this off your hands.
[88:53.00]Alright, we're back to normal, right?
[88:54.16]It's a treasure map, that's cool.
[88:58.38]Hey, you forgot your stuff.
[89:00.14]You forgot your stuff.
[89:02.74]You forgot all his stuff.
[89:06.74]Challenges.
[89:07.48]Okay.
[89:07.81]Okay.
[89:08.35]What did he?
[89:08.79]He left.
[89:09.15]He left.
[89:09.49]A sleeping bag.
[89:12.51]A shovel.
[89:15.03]Oh, sick.
[89:15.49]And an ancient relic from the mummy.
[89:20.21]Sorry.
[89:20.57]That wasn't meant to be like a joke.
[89:30.24]Man.
[89:31.42]Giddy up.
[89:38.50]Looking for the boy.
[89:39.12]This game's great, by the way.
[89:41.46]I already love it.
[89:45.66]Okay, hold on.
[89:46.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[89:49.16]He's like here.
[89:51.81]So, how do I get up there?
[89:53.41]Do I have to go back?
[89:57.91]I don't think I'm supposed to be going this way.
[90:04.33]Yeah, I think I could... I wish it would be marked on the actual...
[90:08.42]Minimap.
[90:09.62]Can't really see.
[90:14.42]Get in the plane?
[90:17.20]Is there a quicker way to open the map?
[90:19.47]Or do I have to hit start every time?
[90:20.65]Alright, so straight ahead.
[90:22.57]So I'm gonna shoot the coyotes, right?
[90:29.67]Oh, that's not a coyote.
[90:30.43]That's a fucking land bird.
[90:33.01]Who cares about the land birds?
[90:35.41]Alright, looking for the boy.
[90:36.65]Should I like whistle?
[90:40.80]He's up here apparently.
[90:41.68]I'm gonna get off the horse.
[90:42.30]It's gotta be like a trap.
[90:47.88]And... I don't see anybody.
[90:50.66]All this blood.
[90:52.32]There's a shoe.
[90:55.21]There's a bone.
[90:58.17]There's a little boy.
[90:59.03]Does this little boy have like size 14?
[91:00.83]He's not so little.
[91:06.74]American Appetite's complete.
[91:09.24]Somebody eat him?
[91:11.70]What?
[91:17.22]I don't get it.
[91:24.81]Oh, you've completed part of this encounter.
[91:25.97]The story's not over.
[91:26.57]Check back at... What the fuck did that just say?
[91:29.29]Check back to town?
[91:29.95]I gotta go back to town?
[91:34.45]Come up here.
[91:38.52]Mission failed.
[91:39.08]We'll get him next time.
[91:41.36]Come here.
[91:41.70]I'm just gonna fast travel.
[91:44.40]Fuck this.
[91:55.15]It said shoot the horse.
[91:56.37]It did not.
[92:02.47]I'm gonna do it.
[92:04.61]Do I have an infinite amount of these bonfires?
[92:14.66]You should still shoot the horse.
[92:15.68]I'm not going to shoot this horse.
[92:21.36]Why would I do that?
[92:27.13]Something going on over here.
[92:29.53]I like that immediately there's just a bunch of shit that they threw at you.
[92:33.33]Just don't run anybody over, please.
[92:37.06]If my daddy had hurried up and died earlier, I might have been able to find a better pursuit.
[92:42.65]So I should go back to the house where that lady was and be like, hey, I found a bunch of blood on the ground.
[92:46.17]I guess, um, whatever.
[92:51.51]Let's just go to Mitchell's.
[92:55.03]Alright, what do you got for me, Mitch?
[93:03.69]Hello?
[93:05.17]Hello?
[93:06.23]It's Armadillo 731.
[93:08.58]What is it with these things?
[93:09.30]You get a new horse?
[93:10.34]Hello!
[93:10.74]It's a new line.
[93:13.57]Hello!
[93:14.89]Hello!
[93:16.35]Sounds fun.
[93:17.05]What's happening?
[93:18.62]I have no idea.
[93:21.23]If it's important, they'll send someone down like they did with you.
[93:24.01]Suddenly, the world is full of days.
[93:26.05]Yeah.
[93:27.73]I remember when we first got here.
[93:28.75]Look at that technology.
[93:29.63]We used to consider people from Dade County to be exotic.
[93:33.02]Now guys can get here from the Midwest, and they can do it in six days.
[93:37.40]Things have changed.
[93:39.04]They've gotten away from me.
[93:41.46]Hello?
[93:41.98]Shoot it, skin it, and call another one.
[93:43.70]Repeat easy profit.
[93:44.86]I mean, I could do that.
[93:48.50]Marshal!
[93:51.01]Marshall!
[93:53.83]Marshall.
[93:55.69]I've just been up in the canyon.
[93:57.03]Spying, like you said?
[93:58.05]This guy's a big baby.
[93:58.91]I think I've seen me a couple of them rustlers.
[94:01.27]I think it was the Ballard twins and a couple of Mexicans.
[94:04.07]They up there right now?
[94:05.47]Well, it was a group of four men rounding up Mr. Gulch's livestock, and none of them looked like any of Gulch's hands.
[94:12.16]You fucking Gerber baby.
[94:13.44]Yes, sir, right now?
[94:14.84]That sarcasm's most unbecoming, Eli.
[94:17.14]It's gonna hold you back in life even worse than your lazy eye.
[94:21.31]Oh, those slurps.
[94:23.45]Alright, mount the horse.
[94:25.83]Oh, that one's like a swirl.
[94:28.29]Everybody has such cool horses.
[94:30.45]Look at that one's mane, it's so beautiful.
[94:53.02]I'm not gonna shoot the horse.
[94:54.76]Stop telling me to shoot the horse.
[94:56.44]I will shoot the giant bald eagle though, because that's gonna give me fucking plus 25 XP.
[95:00.30]See?
[95:16.56]I guess I am.
[95:17.80]I ain't gonna dig this hole no deeper.
[95:20.78]Mount is an Old West term for shoot.
[95:23.28]Really not, that's interesting.
[95:24.28]No, no, no.
[95:25.22]Shoot the horse?
[95:25.98]I'm not going to shoot my own horse.
[95:43.46]I'll be honest with you, Marson.
[95:45.18]I ain't for all this government interference.
[95:47.72]Believe me, Marshal.
[95:48.72]Neither have I. I try to keep the federal boys happy.
[95:52.48]I mean, we need all the help we can get.
[95:54.66]What does a flannel-mouse city boy who's never forked a bale of hay in his life know about a state like New Austin?
[96:01.04]I want to get out of the first tutorial mission stuff.
[96:03.40]We've got a long way to go.
[96:06.10]There's plenty of time for shitty jokes like shoot the horse and watch Guy fall down.
[96:13.21]Guys, you tell me to do the equivalent of, like, slip on a banana peel.
[96:20.57]Don't worry.
[96:21.73]Somebody will slip on a banana peel soon.
[96:23.25]Okay.
[96:27.12]Hold LB to show the weapons menu.
[96:28.42]Stay with the rifle, right?
[96:29.26]Okay.
[96:43.82]Yeah, there's plenty of opportunity for jokes.
[96:45.94]Don't worry.
[96:50.52]I'm the fucking alpha male.
[96:52.03]I go first.
[96:54.41]Oh, wait.
[96:55.69]Oh, okay.
[96:58.85]Well, here they are.
[97:00.25]Eliminate the gang members.
[97:05.82]Oh, no.
[97:06.08]Okay, that's baby face.
[97:08.40]Are you gonna shoot any of these rustlers, boy?
[97:12.43]fades if you target the range.
[97:21.82]I kind of want to arrest one of these guys.
[97:29.28]There he goes.
[97:32.51]Good drop.
[97:32.95]I want to move up and question one of these guys.
[97:36.77]Maybe I can't.
[97:40.97]Where is this dude?
[97:42.19]Is he up top?
[97:42.99]Alright, I'm gonna go with the deputies.
[97:49.53]Because the deputies, I feel like, gets three against... No, I'm not going by myself with this random dude.
[97:56.95]Whoa, okay, that's Deadeye.
[97:58.35]Thanks.
[98:10.05]What are you thinking?
[98:17.21]I want you over here!
[98:19.09]Oh god, babyface, you're gonna die.
[98:24.23]Avatar Award unlocked.
[98:27.11]I got like an old Xbox achievement.
[98:31.08]Alright, let's tackle this guy.
[98:33.68]Come on.
[98:35.06]No, you fucking idiot.
[98:41.53]I got a new avatar piece apparently.
[98:46.29]Loot the body, get some money.
[98:48.49]Alright, let's keep moving.
[98:55.24]This way!
[99:01.00]You're just knocking me out of cover.
[99:06.00]Stop knocking me out of cover, you fucking bogus butthead.
[99:15.73]Alright, go.
[99:17.89]Kill the horse.
[99:19.41]Alright, I'm gonna kill the horse eventually here, just to, like, make sure you guys, like, stop telling me to kill the horse.
[99:26.51]Wait, is that?
[99:30.74]Oh, that's a bad guy.
[99:33.64]Okay.
[99:41.16]No, they're not there.
[99:42.56]Well, there is a guy here.
[99:46.64]Come on.
[99:50.16]Where you at?
[99:53.74]This is the peer pressure stream.
[99:59.70]That guy got double tapped.
[100:06.93]I want to like try to kidnap somebody.
[100:08.97]Like just take them.
[100:11.03]Can't you do that?
[100:14.65]Try another gun.
[100:15.19]We'll try the revolver.
[100:17.21]Playtime's over, kid!
[100:20.95]Alright, come here.
[100:25.43]Can I like... Did I like knock him out?
[100:27.55]Or did I kill him?
[100:29.09]Did I bat him in the head too hard?
[100:36.65]Should I like slice him in the leg?
[100:37.97]Look at the bridge.
[100:41.66]Why am I looking at the bridge?
[100:46.32]Oh, fuck it.
[100:46.84]I don't even care.
[100:47.58]I'm gonna die here.
[100:48.68]Guys, look at that auto-aim.
[100:54.30]Come on.
[100:54.50]There you are.
[100:54.98]Money, money, money, money, money.
[100:58.41]Anybody got anything else?
[101:10.12]I need the lasso.
[101:10.84]Oh, well, okay.
[101:11.16]Just don't fall off the bridge and everything's gonna be fine.
[101:14.13]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

[101:48.99]Get the chest.
[101:49.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[101:49.95]What do you mean chest?
[101:50.81]There's a chest?
[101:51.95]Didn't even see it.
[101:57.52]Back here in like the camp?
[102:04.80]Just lasso people and put them on the train tracks.
[102:12.85]Where's this chest you guys are talking about?
[102:14.25]There it is.
[102:16.79]What would I do without you guys?
[102:23.93]It was just like repeater ammo.
[102:25.25]That's all there was in there.
[102:27.17]I didn't have any money.
[102:35.91]Shoot everything.
[102:37.41]Wait, there's two?
[102:37.95]What do you mean there's two?
[102:38.83]There's not two chests.
[102:40.49]Are you fucking serious?
[102:46.33]Oh god, there was another one.
[102:48.24]There's chest number two.
[102:51.20]Is this the only amount of chests?
[102:55.32]There's twelve dollars, good.
[102:56.84]I can buy myself a snack.
[103:01.22]I didn't get baited, there actually was a chest there.
[103:05.25]For real.
[103:11.17]That's three chests?
[103:11.75]Not three chests!
[103:12.65]Was there a third chest?
[103:14.50]No, this is not a fucking three- I-I-I do- Why does it- Where's the third chest?
[103:28.85]You liars.
[103:29.51]There's not even a third chest here.
[103:51.35]Four chests, four chests.
[103:53.85]No, I don't care.
[103:54.39]They already cleared the whole thing anyways.
[103:55.90]I just have to like run there.
[104:02.06]Some dead bodies were good.
[104:07.06]Cross the bridge.
[104:08.66]Sure.
[104:10.88]I'm so far behind.
[104:19.26]Where are they?
[104:19.66]What's going on?
[104:20.22]No!
[104:20.36]I'm so glad we're right here.
[104:21.42]Where did they go?
[104:21.96]Where the fuck did they even go?
[104:23.66]I don't understand.
[104:25.00]You think I'm joking?
[104:55.75]He's like a baby.

[106:47.54]Holy shit.
[106:48.34]That was very lucky.
[106:49.89]That poor guy's hat.
[107:05.87]Can't wait to regroup.
[107:06.63]I wish I could see.
[107:09.33]He's bald.
[107:09.81]He is very bald.
[107:10.71]How do you sneak?
[107:11.31]Oh, like that.
[107:36.23]Oh, well, nice.
[107:37.29]That was not me.
[107:40.96]That was them.
[107:42.76]They're everywhere.
[107:43.88]Holy fuck.
[107:44.84]TNT?
[107:45.06]Nope.
[107:46.42]Not TNT.
[107:48.16]He's got to be like a bomb that he's closing, right?
[107:53.29]Come on, pop your head up.
[107:54.19]Pop up the head.
[108:05.30]And then watch this.
[108:33.38]No, I'm not killing the cows.
[108:35.24]That ain't gonna happen.
[108:39.93]He did it.
[108:40.49]He shot the TNT.
[108:41.29]What a great cow.
[108:44.61]Do not accidentally shoot any of the random people.
[108:52.25]Should I be looting everybody or does it really not matter that much?
[109:00.73]That I'm not so sure of.
[109:05.80]Is there a boss down here or some bad guy?
[109:07.80]Get that in my fucking face.
[109:14.08]I love that so much.
[109:14.80]Wait, okay.
[109:24.27]Thanks, Marshal.
[109:25.63]We're indebted to you with our lives.
[109:26.93]That was tough.
[109:27.45]Just get them cattle back safe.
[109:29.37]Alright.
[109:30.91]Oh, thank you.
[109:32.11]Oh, thank you so much.
[109:33.17]Thank you.
[109:34.56]Thank you, girl.
[109:35.12]Look at my mark.
[109:35.44]Well done, Mr. Marston.
[109:37.54]Yeah, let me still doesn't have the hat.
[109:39.58]Will he not have the hat for the rest of the game?
[109:41.30]I'll do what I can.
[109:43.76]You know, as you can see, this country is infested with all manner of scum.
[109:49.04]Say that again.
[109:50.08]One other thing, Marston.
[109:51.28]Mr. Johnson, sir.
[109:52.84]It's Mr. Wes Dickens.
[109:54.58]He's missing.
[109:55.80]Who?
[109:56.68]Mr. Wes Dickens, the tonics merchant.
[109:59.32]He was doing town last week.
[110:02.35]Oh, the narcotic and bat piss salesman.
[110:05.01]Who cons housewives out of their money with promises of eternal youth.
[110:08.11]Yes, him, but I think you're being a little unfair.
[110:11.07]He's helped a great many of the county, and many of the townsfolk are really missing him.
[110:15.45]Better than this?
[110:16.17]You hear that, Marston?
[110:17.81]We just butchered a gang of thieves, and the town is up in arms about a missing snake oil merchant.
[110:24.24]I am so glad to be serving such a wise and respectable people.
[110:28.14]Come on, Eli.
[110:31.44]Thank you, Cynical Breakdown.
[110:33.76]Ivory, SUPERHOT, Brad, Berry, and Madman, 3, 175, and Wash Jose for bits.
[110:44.33]So did I, like, liberate a town or something?
[110:45.83]Is that what this means?
[110:48.26]25 bucks.
[110:53.80]Can be found in Chola Springs.
[110:56.02]Okay.
[110:57.10]There's a lot of options now.
[110:59.50]Can I make food or something?
[111:03.04]I don't think so.
[111:04.81]New weaponry is available.
[111:06.11]Spend your hard-earned dollars on increased firepower.
[111:07.85]Cool.
[111:09.49]Alright.
[111:09.99]Here's a chest.
[111:10.91]We're not going to leave any chests.
[111:14.96]Place waypoints with A on the territory map.
[111:16.68]Yeah.
[111:17.84]Shortest path possible.
[111:19.26]Gotcha.
[111:19.58]Let's clear this place first.
[111:24.32]Tons of chests everywhere.
[111:25.42]Let's go do Bonnie's mission.
[111:29.20]We haven't done anything with her in a little while.
[111:35.40]Three chests.
[111:36.14]There we go.
[111:36.76]There are three chests here.
[111:42.23]Money.
[111:42.41]Go.
[111:44.74]Let's talk about inflation for a second.
[111:47.92]With inflation, we're talking about... Pardon the letter.
[111:57.99]It's probably like a couple thousand dollars, right?
[112:00.25]There is a fourth chest.
[112:01.09]No, there's not.
[112:02.21]One, two, three.
[112:05.15]They're not going to put another chest hidden over here.
[112:06.92]It's not going to happen.
[112:10.02]Nope.
[112:12.08]There's not a fourth chest.
[112:16.25]I'm not going to believe a second of you guys telling me that there is one.
[112:20.63]We're just gonna make a campfire and we're gonna go to B. Is that horse pills?
[112:26.72]What the hell are these?
[112:27.28]You guys were not kidding?
[112:29.46]Oh shit, you guys were actually not- What is- Bait?
[112:39.66]You cannot set up a camp in a town, settlement, or gang hideout.
[112:42.20]Oh fuck, well whatever.
[112:50.68]Oh, oh, there's another part of this.
[112:53.04]I want to do this first.
[112:57.08]Nobody baited me.
[112:58.75]Nobody baited me.
[112:59.91]I knew there wasn't a fourth chest.
[113:01.55]You can't do that I got baited if there's no chest that I knew.
[113:05.21]You guys didn't get me.
[113:23.09]Everything's going to be fine.
[113:32.34]That was a nice little shortcut that I just had right there, by the way, folks.
[113:34.70]And then we're going to sneak up this thing.
[113:40.46]It's going to be tight squeeze, so go slow.
[113:43.12]Don't worry.
[113:43.68]You'll get up there without any problems.
[113:47.84]Scenic route.
[113:49.54]And then I think I can put a campfire down now, right?
[113:55.02]Am I close enough where I can just do like this?
[113:56.63]Maybe I'll just ride it.
[113:57.43]I mean, we're like... Whatever.
[114:08.24]Why am I gonna die?
[114:09.20]This isn't like Minecraft.
[114:13.62]You guys act like this like creepers that come out at night.
[114:15.60]Where am I going?
[114:20.87]Straight ahead over here.
[114:23.17]No, no, no.
[114:24.35]I remember this.
[114:25.79]Now I'm putting a campfire down.
[114:26.75]Fuck this.
[114:34.88]Yeah.
[114:35.98]I don't even care.
[114:39.66]Shoot the horse.
[114:40.30]I'm not shooting the horse.
[114:43.90]Why?
[114:44.62]Why would you want me to do something like that?
[114:52.95]Shoot it off the cliff.
[114:59.00]If you're going to fast travel everywhere, why have a horse?
[115:03.58]Thank you, Griff, for the bits.
[115:04.56]100 bits equals one knife kill.
[115:08.68]I never agreed to that.
[115:10.76]No, I already owed the town like $40 or something, right?
[115:14.60]I want to do the next part of this mission.
[115:16.40]Just lit up on the map.
[115:21.81]There it is in here.
[115:24.91]The freaks and geeks, right?
[115:27.73]She's gone.
[115:30.06]Who is?
[115:31.48]My wife.
[115:32.52]She's gone.
[115:33.22]First it was the kid, now it's the wife.
[115:34.66]She went out picking mushrooms in the hills near Hanging Rock, and they got her.
[115:38.78]Oh, God.
[115:39.32]The stories are true.
[115:42.78]What'd the police do about it?
[115:43.96]About as much as you'd expect.
[115:47.73]Made me feel out of form.
[115:49.03]It's an Easter egg if I shoot the horse.
[115:51.33]The barrel ain't strong, but she's a good girl.
[115:56.33]I'll see what I can do.
[116:05.23]Go search for the woman in the hangar.
[116:07.39]Really?
[116:08.45]I was just over there.

[127:25.76]I don't remember.
[127:26.38]We're playing Guess Who right now.
[127:28.02]Did he have a hat?
[127:31.29]He probably cheated.

[127:33.75]This is not the same guy?
[127:34.47]You sure?
[127:34.79]He may have just put a hat on.
[127:43.28]Who's tired of what shit?
[127:48.44]Wait, what?
[127:51.66]Oh.
[127:53.47]Close enough.
[127:54.41]The game's not that sophisticated.
[127:55.79]Where's the bartender?
[127:56.57]Should I just go pour myself a drink?
[127:59.13]That's what I'm going to do.
[128:01.23]Where's the fucking alcohol?
[128:02.39]Where's the free booze?
[128:04.00]I require it.
[128:04.44]Whatever.

[129:09.60]Now he's in trouble, right?
[129:15.06]A skunk!
[129:20.82]How do I, like, pick up the skunk?
[129:26.26]Are you serious?
[129:28.10]Why is there a skunk in the game?
[129:29.44]That's so cool.
[129:30.22]Come here.
[129:31.96]What?
[129:36.17]Oh, hell.
[129:38.83]It's just me and you, skunk.
[129:40.99]We're gonna get out of here.
[129:41.79]Just you and me.
[129:42.69]And we're gonna be fucking renegades.
[129:45.81]No, you're going the wrong way.
[129:47.57]This way.
[129:49.15]Come with me.
[129:49.64]Oh.
[129:53.85]That was the store owner?
[129:56.09]Oh, great.
[129:57.03]That's not good.
[129:58.51]Alright, come on.
[130:00.95]Come here, horse.
[130:01.51]Oh, God.
[130:08.74]What is sprinting over here?
[130:09.70]Oh, it's the horse.
[130:10.22]Alright, get on, get on, get on, get on.
[130:12.60]Come here.

[130:25.02]Almost.
[130:25.16]A little.
[130:27.94]Fucking keep forgetting that.
[130:29.94]If I forget that one more time, I swear to god.
[130:35.87]Catch the skunk.
[130:41.95]This, yes, this is the first time I've ever played the game.
[130:45.53]Alright, I'm good.
[130:47.23]Right off into the distance, and we're gonna go back to, uh, V town.
[130:55.47]Western acid base.
[130:56.75]It really is.
[130:57.33]It's great.
[130:57.73]I love it.
[131:01.32]I'm just repping my cow engine.
[131:05.80]Alright, we're good.
[131:10.88]Oh, shit.
[131:11.44]Okay.
[131:17.00]And let's travel.
[131:19.14]This is only on console.
[131:20.28]It's only on Xbox 360.
[131:25.46]Well, I mean, you can play it on PlayStation 4, but you need to use PlayStation Now, which is a little unreliable.
[131:37.03]Still cool, though.
[131:45.10]Thank you, Tacos, for the bits.
[131:48.41]Don't shoot your horse.
[131:49.25]Hold it instead.
[131:50.01]Caress it.
[131:50.55]Cuddle it.
[131:50.97]When the time is right, kiss it.
[131:52.57]Thank you for the bits.
[131:56.07]StinkyBadBoy gave 253 bits.
[131:58.71]Thanks.
[132:00.67]Gift.
[132:00.89]Thank you also for the bits.
[132:01.91]And Blastoise.
[132:02.41]All that for $25.
[132:02.77]I know.
[132:02.93]It was a mistake.
[132:03.65]Let's go get it done.
[132:19.46]Mr. Arston, I've been hearing about your plans.
[132:23.12]Have you, Miss McFarland?
[132:24.52]Yes, from Lee Johnson.
[132:26.23]To settle here and build a life for yourself.
[132:29.31]Um, friendles aren't my plans.
[132:31.27]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[132:32.19]I already have a life.
[132:33.39]I'll do it.
[132:33.79]Well, I have one.
[132:34.95]I will pay my bounty.
[132:35.97]I will be a good boy and pay it.
[132:37.35]Maybe what you could say is I had two and I'm trying to end one of them so the other can survive.
[132:43.51]you do so love to talk and riddle I mean it's on ps3 but you can't play it on ps4 if you have like you can play it on Xbox One probably miss mcfarland the only way you can play it on PlayStation 4 is if you have owned PlayStation now which is not a really reliable service miss mcfarland I'm married I have a son I had a daughter but she died
[133:12.27]Years before that, I rode in a gang.
[133:15.15]We robbed banks, trains, held people ransom.
[133:19.63]We killed people we didn't like.
[133:21.27]Plug in your PlayStation 3.
[133:22.25]Bill Williams was in that gang.
[133:24.05]Who wants to have, like, five consoles in their fucking room?
[133:28.86]Great harm will befall my family.
[133:32.50]Now, I don't suppose any of this is very interesting to you, but I hope it explains why I wasn't so eager to talk about it.
[133:41.02]No, I do understand.
[133:42.58]Call me Bonnie.
[133:44.02]I had no idea.
[133:45.12]You poor man.
[133:46.90]Even in this new country, memories don't really fade.
[133:49.88]Alright, now teach me all you know.
[133:50.62]My father was an illiterate Scot born on the boat into New York.
[133:53.99]PlayStation, I was fine.
[133:54.61]You were just trying to scream at the same time.
[133:55.59]I have two Internets.
[133:57.21]He never saw his homeland, but... So, I have two separate minds.
[134:00.07]Did you hear him talk about it?
[134:01.71]You'd imagine he only ever ate haggis and wore a kilt.
[134:06.23]And he hated the English for what they had done to his great-grandparents that he'd never met.
[134:11.72]People don't forget.
[134:12.91]Internets.
[134:13.59]Yeah, I have two internets.
[134:15.41]That's true.
[134:16.77]Especially when it comes to money.
[134:18.17]Two internets?
[134:19.07]And you know, even now, after all his labors, my father's debts are still terrible.
[134:24.07]Two whole internets.
[134:25.45]I worry every day about his losing his mansion.
[134:27.31]I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you I was on a separate internet when I was streaming it to this console.
[134:32.75]His eyes were... Yeah, it doesn't mean it's been good.
[134:35.57]Let's just say he was blinded in a bar fight south of Chicago.
[134:40.31]My mother died during childbirth.
[134:43.57]She was a prostitute and he was her... Well, I don't know what he was.
[134:50.35]So I was sent off to an orphanage and ran away and fell in with the gang.
[134:56.08]My word.
[134:57.84]What a difficult life.
[134:58.88]That's a really nice nautical necklace.
[135:00.62]The leader of the gang taught me how to read.
[135:03.26]Taught me how to see all that was good in the world.
[135:06.02]He was a great man in a way.
[135:08.57]But you killed people.
[135:10.56]Sure.
[135:11.68]And I've suffered for it.
[135:12.66]And that's the life I left.
[135:15.38]I tried to leave.
[135:16.11]Great story.
[135:17.75]I said too much, Bonnie.
[135:19.17]That's cool.
[135:20.45]I'm an uneducated killer sent here to do all I can do well.
[135:24.67]I'm going to prove you that by killing you in about 12 seconds when this cutscene is over.
[135:30.07]And a rich man can be elected governor on the back of these promises.
[135:34.39]Everybody needs help.
[135:35.14]Miss McFarland, I have two internets.
[136:01.99]Kill a horse.
[136:02.63]Kill a horse.
[136:03.37]I don't... What is this kill a horse joke?
[136:06.49]Like, kill a horse meme.
[136:13.28]You've seen some... I wasn't... I was trying to make, like, a... Oh, now she's, like, running around in circles.
[136:20.22]No, no, no, no, no.
[136:21.02]Alright, let's go.
[136:23.71]Are you ready?
[136:26.23]Are you ready?
[136:26.89]Let's get it on, gentlemen.
[136:35.58]Why can you do this on the horse?
[136:36.76]I wish I could throw the knife.
[136:38.56]Fuck it.
[136:38.86]What?
[136:39.02]Oh, come on.
[136:40.18]Crap.
[136:40.38]That's all he has to say?
[136:41.14]Crap.
[137:03.77]Put on the suit.
[137:05.53]I will.
[137:06.23]After this.
[137:15.12]Let's go.
[137:15.52]Alright, let's go Bonnie.
[137:21.68]Two whole internets.
[137:22.86]Rich streamer.
[137:23.30]Well, one of them is not good.
[137:24.36]So don't worry.
[137:34.40]The other one is supposed to be good, but it's also not good.
[137:36.50]They're both not good.
[137:37.32]Don't worry.
[137:37.72]I'm not gonna kill her.
[137:38.26]How are you?
[137:38.74]Alright, moving to position behind the herd.
[138:06.43]She's over here.
[138:07.81]Heard the cows out of the pen.
[138:12.67]Like, first fucking try.
[138:17.71]That was... I got them all.
[138:18.85]No, I have to keep moving them.
[138:22.73]Alright, well, go.
[138:26.23]Just stay behind them.
[138:33.06]Come on.
[138:33.60]Come on.
[138:34.52]Come on.
[138:35.30]Turn around.
[138:39.04]Get over there.
[138:41.68]Get up there, you old... Bessie!
[138:48.64]Oh god, I really... This is gonna be so annoying!
[138:53.96]Doesn't the game already like this exist?
[138:55.30]No, no, no, no, no!
[138:55.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[138:58.06]Oh, shit.
[139:00.96]Okay, they're doing it for me.
[139:03.80]They're gone.
[139:07.55]Just gonna stay back.
[139:16.36]No, don't take the knife out.
[139:17.44]Slow down.
[139:18.06]Slow down.
[139:18.56]Slow down.
[139:20.66]There we go.
[139:21.56]There's more to herd.
[139:27.82]There's so many of them.
[139:30.74]Alright, we'll keep moving.
[139:32.36]Press drive to herd.
[139:33.48]Alright.
[139:43.02]Let's go.
[139:44.73]That's not that bad.
[139:46.15]It's not that bad.
[139:47.17]Yeah.
[139:48.57]Come on.
[139:49.92]Stay with him.
[139:50.42]He just jumped off.
[139:51.52]Let's go.
[139:52.52]Keep him tight now.
[139:53.22]And one more, and we did it.
[140:02.15]That was fun.
[140:03.35]Just you wait.
[140:03.97]It gets harder.
[140:04.63]This mission is when I quit?
[140:06.35]Why?
[140:06.63]Okay.
[140:06.85]That was not that long.
[140:09.21]Get some honor.
[140:09.75]I gotta pay my bills.
[140:11.11]Alright.
[140:31.02]Let's go pay my bill.
[140:37.86]Okay, back to B. Cool.
[140:49.31]Kill them?
[140:49.91]No.
[140:52.81]Well, hello, Mr. Marston.
[140:54.25]How are you?
[140:55.21]Fine, thank you.
[140:55.91]How are you?
[140:56.47]I'm fine, thank you.
[140:58.32]Did you meet my father?
[141:00.04]John Marston, this is my father, Drew McFarlane.
[141:03.78]Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Marston.
[141:06.00]Please.
[141:09.78]So, my daughter informs me that you're here on some secret mission to remove some undesirables from the county.
[141:19.42]Something like that.
[141:21.89]I'm grateful for the hospitality, sir.
[141:25.25]Well, you know, we've lived here for 30 years now.
[141:28.37]Don't let me hear from the East.
[141:31.59]The land had never been settled.
[141:34.65]For ten years, we fought the Indians, tough men, Mickey Allen, and we had outlaws and we had drought and smallpox.
[141:44.29]Shoot horse, shoot horse cholera.
[141:46.39]God, I bury more of my children now raised.
[141:50.99]Sorry to hear that, sir.
[141:52.23]What can I get for food?
[141:53.65]I've seen strong men wither and die under that unforgiving sun.
[141:57.84]I want like a buffalo chicken wrap, even though my stomach is bothering me.
[142:02.44]But I've never once doubted my life here.
[142:05.58]No, sir.
[142:08.52]When I hear about this so-called federal government sending out agents to covertly murder...
[142:16.39]and control people, then I start to worry.
[142:21.38]Williamson is a menace, and men like him are the plague.
[142:25.98]But isn't a government agent a worse menace?
[142:28.42]And all that symbolizes, I mean.
[142:31.02]You may be right, sir.
[142:34.71]Well, you're a brave man.
[142:36.33]I wish I could grow facial hair like that.
[142:37.71]You're always going to be welcome here.
[142:41.29]But you tell your friends out east that we don't want to live like that out here.
[142:46.91]Sneaking around and spying and secret missions.
[142:50.57]That's such heavy facial hair.
[142:52.16]Preposterous.
[142:53.86]Trust me, sir.
[142:54.46]I agree with you.
[142:58.70]Good.
[143:01.00]Well, we won't insult you any further.
[143:03.60]That facial hair is like grass.
[143:05.42]That's like freshly mowed grass on his mouth.
[143:08.45]It's daddy's favorite pastime.
[143:10.57]Apart from political discourse, that is.
[143:12.67]What is?
[143:13.59]Breaking in horses.
[143:15.85]Come on, I hear you're a pretty decent rider.
[143:18.95]For a city dweller, that is.
[143:22.51]Shoot the facial hair.
[143:26.79]Why are their animations delayed compared to their voices?
[143:28.81]Because they're, hold on a minute here.
[143:33.99]You're gonna need this, Mr. Marston.
[143:35.29]Because I'm on a terrible capture card, that's why.
[143:37.55]I wanna see, I wanna do one more test here.
[143:41.96]Right, now you got some rope on your belt, let's see if we can't wrangle some horses.
[143:47.33]Not your horse.
[143:52.30]Time to get the lasso?
[143:52.96]Good.
[143:53.24]Cool.
[143:55.98]I heard this is a fun part.
[144:01.83]Lasso is mustache.
[144:03.23]Yeah, I'm gonna like grab this guy's mustache.
[144:06.07]Watch out, dog.
[144:07.86]You sure have some interesting theories on what the government's doing, sir.
[144:11.67]So, the audio happens before or after?
[144:14.00]You know what I mean?
[144:14.88]Like, do you guys see an animation and then you hear it?
[144:21.83]The government can go to hell if you ask me.
[144:24.45]Those sons of bitches can steal a coin off of dead man's eyes.
[144:28.27]Mr. Marston.
[144:29.68]He's right.
[144:30.70]Now, I don't know much about politics.
[144:32.68]Please, Paul, can we just enjoy the ride?
[144:34.74]But I know we're only as free as they say we are.
[144:37.62]Power's like a drink.
[144:38.80]The more you have, the more you want.
[144:41.02]There's few men who can handle it.
[144:43.16]There's certain things in this country a woman could do much better if you ask me.
[144:47.06]I ain't gonna argue with that, Miss McFarlane.
[144:50.97]I wonder if I can adjust this.
[144:52.11]I might be able to do it.
[144:52.79]I'm going to blast out the animation in a sec, I wish.
[145:06.24]I'm going to try something really quickly here.
[145:08.76]I want to see what happens.
[145:09.58]Hopefully I don't fuck this whole thing up.
[145:11.42]I might.
[145:13.20]So.
[145:15.29]I might just do a little bit of an offset.
[145:16.81]So you... Let me get this really, really, really clear before I fuck with this for a second.
[145:21.35]So you guys hear the audio, then, like, a quarter of a second later, the animation happens, right?
[145:31.72]Is that what you're saying?
[145:40.94]No.
[145:41.39]No.
[145:41.69]Correct.
[145:42.27]No.
[145:44.78]Let's see what happens when I do this.
[145:49.52]Alright, I gave it a try.
[145:52.56]I wonder what this is going to do.
[145:55.35]There they are!
[145:55.89]Let's get after them!
[145:57.09]Hopefully that didn't fuck up everything.
[145:58.35]Come on!
[145:58.57]Let's roll for it!
[146:00.33]Let's go!
[146:00.73]Whoa!
[146:03.93]The lasso out.
[146:04.65]Come on!
[146:05.09]Don't be afraid of it!
[146:13.81]Hold on, Marshal!
[146:14.77]Don't lose him!
[146:15.53]Okay, and then how do you, how do you, how do you, how do you catch the fish?
[146:22.14]Hold there!
[146:22.36]What do I have to do?
[146:25.16]Is this like an AT-AT?
[146:26.12]Come on then, Bronco Buster!
[146:27.92]Up you get!
[146:29.16]Nearly there!
[146:29.94]You're doing great!
[146:30.64]You stay centered!
[146:31.44]Wait, what the fuck?
[146:32.40]Let's see it, boy!
[146:35.21]Try not to take off too late!
[146:38.03]Am I doing it right?
[146:38.89]Show me what you got, boy!
[146:42.48]I'm good, right?
[146:47.01]How much longer do I have to do this for?
[146:54.65]Got him.
[146:57.17]I'm impressed.
[146:58.59]Alright, how is it?
[147:02.83]Is the audio better?
[147:03.63]Did I make it better or worse?
[147:16.49]I'm trying to rope that.
[147:27.03]What are you waiting for?
[147:28.05]That's it.
[147:29.47]Hold him there.
[147:31.00]Thought we had him there.
[147:33.78]Oh, got him.
[147:34.68]Slow down.
[147:36.06]Got him.
[147:36.88]Hop on and show him who's boss.
[147:39.82]He's there for the taking.
[147:41.30]I know I got to stay on.
[147:43.56]Almost got you.
[147:46.12]I love this little balance game.
[147:56.90]Do I do this with people too when I lasso a person?
[147:59.18]That would be fucking hilarious.
[148:05.15]Shoot the horse, it makes it...
[148:11.84]No, we're in the... Hey!
[148:12.94]Nice work!
[148:14.25]I think that'll do it for today.
[148:16.03]Let's get back to the ranch.
[148:18.07]Easy now.
[148:18.55]Got ya.
[148:18.99]Alright, got my horse.
[148:20.23]No, wait.
[148:20.51]Oh, that is mine.
[148:22.15]Whose horse is this?
[148:24.12]This is my horse.
[148:28.39]I like your father.
[148:29.31]I'm glad.
[148:30.69]He's quite a character.
[148:32.27]You have a good life here.
[148:34.11]A life I want.
[148:34.91]For me and my family, I mean.
[148:36.85]We don't have a lot anymore.
[148:38.77]You have enough.
[148:39.89]It's one to get so many folks in trouble.
[148:42.41]It'll sap your spirit and make you poor.
[148:44.83]But it's straight.
[148:46.09]And it's decent.
[148:47.15]There's no better night's sleep than after an honest day's work.
[148:50.80]It's no wonder you look so tired, though.
[148:53.74]So Jack must be Shahad Joker, Miss McFarlane.
[149:02.89]He really had to go to the bathroom during that one.
[149:05.07]Lasso her?
[149:05.53]Is it going to fail the mission?
[149:07.35]Yeah, I can't do it.
[149:08.75]It's just the tutorial.
[149:10.31]I'm not going to pay my bills up there.
[149:34.81]The whole game's editorial.
[149:35.85]I had to go to the bathroom joke.
[149:39.43]I know I did.
[149:40.69]Thank you, Ilvery.
[149:41.79]Thank you.
[149:42.23]Thank you, Mr. Marston.
[149:42.93]Let's head for Armadillo.
[149:44.60]Let's talk with some friends, also, earlier.
[149:58.54]Whoa there.
[150:00.12]You never did tell me why you were never married.
[150:02.90]Aside from the snobbery, that is.
[150:04.70]You sure ask a lot.
[150:06.14]I'm just surprised, that's all.
[150:08.24]You must have been quite a kid.
[150:10.03]The fact that you're talking in the past says it all.
[150:13.27]No, that's not what I mean.
[150:15.39]You must have had some suitors, that's all I'm saying.
[150:18.47]Some, I suppose.
[150:20.07]Here and there.
[150:20.69]A ranch in the middle of nowhere.
[150:23.98]I'm not gonna shoot my own horse.
[150:25.99]I'm not doing it.
[150:37.72]You're going really fast.
[150:38.82]You're going too fast.
[150:40.00]Oh, he's bringing up his wife.
[150:41.88]Bringing up the wife.
[150:43.28]She's like you.
[151:06.19]Oh, these are good guys, okay.
[151:08.84]Let's go.
[151:09.98]Come on, please.
[151:10.76]Are we herding again?
[151:13.02]Let's not do a herd mission again.
[151:34.89]Watch this jump.
[151:36.01]Never mind.
[151:41.61]They made a game based on a million ways to die.
[151:48.42]Guide the herd toward the canyon.
[151:51.96]So this is just a herding mission.
[151:53.52]Alright.
[151:56.06]And I can do like the get over there command, right?
[152:01.07]That way that way that way that way that way go that way You little shit go this way You guys are like the equivalent of bugs right now you cockroaches come on Am I eventually gonna have to lasso one of these
[152:27.34]No, just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[152:28.78]Slow down, slow down.
[152:29.84]No, I've lost a couple of those fucking paper boats.
[152:33.42]That's what they are on the mini-map.
[152:36.41]Oh, shit.
[152:38.23]Alright, I gotta go back.
[152:39.45]I gotta... No, no, get over here.
[152:45.33]Get over here.
[152:47.63]Get... slow down!
[152:49.97]Get the fuck over there.
[152:51.83]Oh my god.

[152:57.75]Wait, just... Just please.
[153:03.91]You stupid horses.
[153:05.08]I'm gonna go all the way around.
[153:06.12]Okay, there we go.
[153:11.32]Now... Go.
[153:13.00]Come on.
[153:16.68]Go on.
[153:19.49]Where are you going up there?
[153:20.75]Why are you going up there?
[153:21.83]I don't just, as long as I get like three, right?
[153:24.26]That's all.
[153:40.18]I was trying to shoot him in the head with a gun.
[153:41.69]I was.
[153:50.19]I didn't even have to do anything and they ran the right way.
[153:54.05]Send a message, shoot one.
[153:55.11]That's what I was trying to do.
[153:59.13]Go on.
[154:00.49]Move your ass.
[154:08.09]No, don't split off.
[154:09.03]Why does the golden one have to split off every time?
[154:18.37]There we go.
[154:25.39]I'm with stupid.
[154:28.55]Shoot your horse to prove that you're not fucking around.
[154:39.54]Alright, I'll do it.
[154:40.90]Let's chase the stallion.
[154:49.09]I missed.
[154:50.59]Holy fuck, this guy.
[154:51.79]This horse is fast.
[154:54.41]Sonic the Hedgehog.
[154:57.67]I'm gonna play the Sonic the Hedgehog music right now.
[155:03.97]Ah, fuck.
[155:04.83]He was, like, dodging me.
[155:05.81]He was just juking me.
[155:06.65]Those are some really professional jukes there, buddy.
[155:18.92]Ah!
[155:25.52]Around a circle!
[155:27.20]Oh, you fucking hordes!
[155:29.42]Come here!
[155:32.10]Get over here!
[155:33.00]Stop going over here!
[155:34.64]He's going like off-road!
[155:38.02]Come here!
[155:40.92]Get over here!
[155:44.02]Ooh, let's do a little bit of fun!
[155:51.63]I need auto-aim.
[155:55.63]I don't need auto-aim, I get it.
[155:57.23]I just can't wait to lasso a person and drag them around.
[156:06.62]That's like the whole reason why you play this game, right?
[156:12.38]Wait, what the fuck?!
[156:15.94]What?!
[156:17.06]Come on, this is no way!
[156:22.15]I did the animation that, like, it was over.
[156:24.40]The fucking minigame was over.
[156:25.70]Did you see that?
[156:27.34]No way.
[156:28.34]Oh, that's such bullshit.
[156:30.54]It was done.
[156:31.50]It was over.
[156:32.66]He said, okay, and... God.
[156:42.47]I'm about to shoot the stallion.
[156:55.39]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[156:56.85]It did the You Did It animation.
[157:08.80]Just get him, please.
[157:17.04]He like broke my neck.
[157:17.96]I landed on my neck.
[157:23.78]Okay, all these sounds, I like, I used all these sounds in Jerma Rumble for the horse.
[157:36.93]No.
[157:38.29]Fuck.
[157:39.97]I did it.
[157:42.57]No.
[157:45.01]I said it.
[157:53.38]I thought the mission was over.
[157:54.38]I didn't think it was going to be possible, and it was possible.
[158:00.03]Why did I do that?
[158:00.91]What the fuck is the point of that?
[158:03.05]Shoot the horse, shoot the horse, shoot the horse.
[158:04.53]Now I don't have to do it again.
[158:05.45]Oh my god.
[158:15.19]All this fucking around.
[158:16.15]I'm not supposed to be fucking around this stream.
[158:17.81]This is supposed to be a stream where I play the game.
[158:25.75]Come here.
[158:26.89]Let's go.
[158:28.77]Such a fucking idiot.
[158:37.24]Almost got it.
[158:39.70]I was so frustrated that I had to do that.
[158:41.52]I had to get my revenge.
[158:43.48]You guys know that was a thing, right?
[158:59.34]Got it.
[158:59.72]Okay.
[159:00.36]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[159:09.48]That's not gonna happen.
[159:15.68]Hi, Bonnie.
[159:19.72]No, I'm not doing it.
[159:20.42]So, the stallion's faster, I'm gonna assume.
[159:22.19]That's some sick riding.
[159:23.11]We got a nice car upgrade.
[159:24.89]I upgraded my exhaust.
[159:50.01]So now I have a lasso.
[159:50.83]Alright.
[159:53.46]Well, this is where it all goes downhill, guys.
[159:57.48]So, like, this is where it ends.
[159:58.70]This is where literally the stream is going to turn to shit.
[160:04.22]Apparently that hurt.
[160:07.54]I want to check that out.
[160:08.34]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[160:09.62]We're up here.
[160:09.96]Might as well do this mission, right?
[160:13.98]There's a clue, man.
[160:21.26]Uh, blood?
[160:21.80]Yeah, there's another, like, dead person.
[160:26.28]Another shoe.
[160:26.86]The same shoe and a fork.
[160:29.69]Who left a fork in the shoe?
[160:31.15]I don't know.
[160:38.07]American appetite's complete.
[160:41.43]Okay.
[160:43.86]Where'd my horse go?
[160:44.80]There he is.
[160:50.21]Anything else out here that I need to look at?
[160:53.41]Not really.
[160:53.95]Let's just head back to... What do you think?
[161:02.88]Bonnie or... I want to go to the gunsmith.
[161:06.52]I want to go to Armadillo.
[161:07.56]Check out the gunsmith.
[161:11.76]Pay the bounty too.
[161:13.14]Can I pay the bounty in Armadillo?
[161:19.19]No, fuck it.
[161:19.77]I don't care.
[161:20.17]You need a better spot for your camp.
[161:30.34]Come on.
[161:36.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[161:38.20]I pressed warhorse.
[161:40.80]That's not what I wanted.
[161:45.79]Shit.
[161:46.35]Wait.
[161:47.23]I'm gonna have to ride.
[161:50.19]I wanna ride.
[161:51.79]I think I fucked something up royally there.
[162:01.44]It's gonna be alright.
[162:02.60]I just need to, like, hitch this horse.
[162:05.30]And everything's gonna be good.
[162:11.24]We're good.
[162:11.92]We're good.
[162:12.94]The warhorse is better.
[162:13.92]The stallion's faster, isn't it?
[162:15.38]The stallion is definitely faster.
[162:17.79]I'm going at least, like, 5-10% faster.
[162:24.31]I just need to hitch it.
[162:25.59]There's a random horse.
[162:26.73]Should I lasso this horse?
[162:29.59]Fuck it, I don't care.
[162:33.38]Kill them both.
[162:34.16]No.
[162:39.64]It's fun to ride around, though.
[162:44.15]Warhorse is the best horse in the game?
[162:47.77]Why would they give you the best horse in the game?
[162:49.21]In the very beginning of the game.
[162:53.66]Seems a little odd.
[162:56.85]You can get through there.
[162:58.63]I know you can.
[162:59.63]Okay, you can't.
[163:00.79]That's fine.
[163:02.45]Check out the gunsmith.
[163:03.13]I want to hitch the horse.
[163:08.33]The warhorse is DLC.
[163:09.69]Oh.
[163:13.02]You already did this.
[163:14.22]This guy already did this shit.
[163:18.80]Alright, I got him.
[163:25.87]What do I do with him?
[163:30.81]No, shit.
[163:31.33]I'm trying to, like, drag him.
[163:33.63]Why is everybody attacking me?
[163:35.61]That's the wrong guy.
[163:36.73]Shit.
[163:38.51]I'm just, like, tying this guy up.
[163:43.92]What the fuck?
[163:46.44]Okay.
[163:48.38]Did the guy get away?
[163:49.26]Alright, well, he's tied up.
[163:59.20]This is great.
[164:01.38]You can just pick him up.
[164:02.32]Whoa!
[164:08.06]Hey!
[164:09.66]Easy!
[164:12.60]Now who's shooting at me?
[164:14.66]What?
[164:15.89]I was trying to save... That's such bullshit.
[164:18.99]Everybody knows it.
[164:21.13]He's going to run his head over.
[164:22.11]I don't know what to do here.
[164:26.89]I'm going to run over here.
[164:30.36]Where's my horse?
[164:32.42]No, there's a stallion.
[164:33.10]Come here.
[164:37.08]Come over here.
[164:39.58]Oh, there's my horse.
[164:42.28]Run his fucking head over.
[164:45.18]I need to hitch the horse.
[164:45.86]The horse has been hitched.
[164:52.98]I want to go to the gun shop.
[164:55.66]This is not the gun shop, is it?
[164:57.18]Closed.
[164:59.73]They're open, though.
[165:01.39]Alright, what do you got?
[165:05.53]Base.
[165:06.63]Volcanic pistol.
[165:08.27]Double-barreled shotgun.
[165:09.29]Alright, sell.
[165:11.25]I don't have anything to sell.
[165:18.12]Shotgun ammo.
[165:19.04]Explosive ammo.
[165:21.86]I mean, I could buy the double-barreled shotgun.
[165:24.84]Or the volcanic pistol.
[165:30.99]I kind of want to... Power, rate of fire, reload speed.
[165:40.46]Um... I think I want the shotgun.
[165:44.90]I'm buying the shotgun.
[165:49.67]Shotgun ammo, I don't have a... I do.
[165:51.83]Shotgun ammo.
[165:52.41]Let's equip this.
[166:00.81]There's a double-barreled shotgun loaded up.
[166:04.45]Oh, don't aim it at anybody, please.
[166:10.66]Okay.
[166:11.16]What's this guy shooting at over here?
[166:15.32]Something's apparently going on in the general store.
[166:23.18]Are those guys still tied up over there?
[166:24.44]Okay.
[166:30.14]I'm not sure... What is this guy's deal?
[166:36.54]That was a pretty good joke.
[166:39.95]Is this guy... Should I open this door?
[166:43.23]Come on in here then.
[166:43.89]What should I do about this guy?
[167:01.38]Lasso him?
[167:03.64]I mean, he's kind of unpredictable right now, right?
[167:06.74]Wait, what am I doing?
[167:11.89]Why is the whole town after me?
[167:18.07]Why am I going to rot in jail?
[167:20.58]Wasn't this guy the guy with the gun?
[167:31.02]Where am I gonna, where am I taking this guy?
[167:36.54]What?
[167:37.00]Is that really?
[167:40.26]That was the sheriff?
[167:45.32]No, what?
[167:49.48]Oh god, maybe it was.
[167:50.94]But what the fuck was he doing?
[167:55.90]Look, you can't fault me there.
[167:56.94]He was like pointing a gun.
[167:57.82]I thought I was doing like a good thing.
[168:04.10]Guy is pointing a gun.
[168:06.76]At like nothing.
[168:07.94]I thought he was like, it threw a good deed!
[168:09.88]Oh, fucking god.
[168:19.46]Well, now I have to pay $130.
[168:21.48]Come on, follow me to the ends of the Earth.
[168:32.24]Man, at least I got a shotgun now.
[168:36.28]Just give up at this point.
[168:37.36]Give yourself up.
[168:42.94]How did that go?
[168:53.50]I'm hidden.
[168:56.54]I'm not hidden.
[168:58.81]How do I tie him up?
[169:02.11]No, shit!
[169:06.71]God damn it.
[169:16.13]Well, that guy got fucking murdered.
[169:18.05]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[169:22.17]Come here!
[169:23.02]Come here, horse, come here!
[169:23.96]I'm just riding off into fucking nowhere, by the way.
[169:34.60]This is not a drop, right?
[169:35.64]Not a drop, right?
[169:37.58]This doesn't look like a drop.
[169:38.48]It's not.
[169:41.10]Okay.
[169:41.56]Now, please, just... Go this way.
[169:45.36]Get it down.
[169:46.12]Whatever.
[169:48.96]So, what happens if the sheriff is dead?
[169:50.19]I didn't technically kill the sheriff, though.
[169:59.09]I carried the sheriff, and then somebody shot him in the head.
[170:04.00]I didn't do it.
[170:10.64]Let's just go back there.
[170:18.06]There's infinite cops.
[170:22.13]Who has a mission right now?
[170:23.93]Let's go to the far ones.
[170:31.78]I have to clear my name, but I don't think I have, like, a way to do it.
[170:40.56]Just go get the pardon letter?
[170:42.00]Is that... I actually could... Yeah, I know what that is.
[170:47.67]That's, like, here, right?
[170:50.37]Poker, doctor's office, night watch.
[170:53.27]Pay bounty.
[170:55.07]Who has the pardon letter?
[170:57.96]Pay bounty.
[170:58.48]Pay bounty.
[171:06.16]Do I still have it in my inventory?
[171:12.56]That's too late.
[171:13.14]Let's see what I got.
[171:23.02]Medicine kit.
[171:24.66]Pardon letter.
[171:28.06]Removes any accumulated bounty when turned into the local train station.
[171:31.08]Okay.
[171:34.02]I have to wait until like morning.
[171:35.12]Maybe I don't.
[171:38.70]Why do I?
[171:39.44]Give pardon letter.
[171:40.26]Alright.
[171:41.14]Give pardon letter.
[171:45.42]One count of murder, two counts of murder, one count of abduction, and one count of assault.
[171:48.96]I want to shoot him in the face right now so bad.
[171:54.74]Oh my god, the urge is fucking extreme right now.
[171:58.28]Oh, it's extreme for me to not shoot this guy right in the head.
[172:02.40]God damn it.
[172:07.27]No, I can't.
[172:07.97]I just... No.
[172:08.85]Get me out of this.
[172:11.91]I'm not gonna break any more laws.
[172:13.63]Not for a while.
[172:15.25]We're good.
[172:16.15]Alright, come here.
[172:17.65]Come here, old Bessie.
[172:22.01]Speaking of Bessie... What do you think?
[172:24.35]B or W?
[172:28.40]Coward.
[172:35.66]I couldn't sleep too.
[172:38.10]I'm just going to go to bed.
[172:39.60]I'm going to go to bed and then we're going to go to W. We're going to ride the stagecoach.
[172:44.89]Is that the right term?
[172:46.69]Stagecoach?
[172:47.39]What is a stagecoach?
[172:49.65]Chest?
[172:50.77]What's in this?
[172:54.34]Go fight a bear in the mountains.
[172:56.70]That would actually be kind of fun.
[173:02.34]Uh... Elegant suit.
[173:03.46]Complete outfit.
[173:04.26]Purchase suit from the tailor in Thieves Landing.
[173:09.06]I don't have any of these.
[173:09.80]Oh well.
[173:19.35]Stagecoach is the guy who tells the stage what to do in a Broadway production.
[173:22.25]Oh well, fuck.
[173:23.37]That's not right.
[173:31.49]Good morning.

[173:50.62]I was right.
[173:51.18]You guys are all telling me I'm wrong.
[173:55.55]I was correct.
[173:57.85]How did I, wait, what do you mean?

[176:07.34]Stand still!
[176:10.84]Alright, take me in.
[176:20.53]One count of murder and law officer, one count of vehicle theft.
[176:23.29]What happens if you surrender?
[176:33.37]How long am I in jail for?
[176:39.57]How many fucking months am I in here for?
[176:41.55]Am I gonna ruin the game?
[176:47.53]What?
[176:47.73]I have to complete a bounty mission?
[176:53.69]Three IRL hours.
[176:57.99]But, um... Wait a minute.
[177:01.09]I didn't kill anybody.
[177:02.75]Oh, yeah, I did.
[177:04.09]I did.
[177:04.52]They're right.
[177:05.00]I did.
[177:06.52]Okay, that's fine.
[177:09.54]I'll do this.
[177:11.08]Let's go get this fucking mission ready.
[177:16.60]He's down here.
[177:17.39]Roscoe Duffy.
[177:21.59]Where's my horse dog?
[177:25.75]There he is.
[177:26.43]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[177:28.13]Hyah!
[177:30.73]Let's go get Duffy.
[177:36.72]Well, that... Look, I don't even know what I was in trouble for.
[177:41.54]Can you guys tell me why I was in trouble?
[177:43.40]I can't tell you why.
[177:44.60]I don't have an answer.
[177:48.04]I fucked up the stagecoach.
[177:49.94]I accidentally grabbed a guy and threw him.
[177:53.68]And... I drove the stagecoach incorrectly into a wall.
[177:57.98]And apparently that's enough to kill me.
[177:59.32]That's enough to shoot me.
[178:01.69]Am I gonna be able to get down this?
[178:07.64]No, I'm not gonna be able to get down that.
[178:10.70]I wish there was like an armored horse that I could just... Where's the car?
[178:14.42]Can I do that with a stagecoach?
[178:15.58]Would I live?
[178:16.38]Who is shooting me?
[178:19.62]What the fuck?
[178:20.34]What did I do?
[178:21.02]What the fuck?
[178:25.90]Why?
[178:26.30]Fine, you wanna fucking play this game?
[178:37.19]What was that guy diving to?
[178:39.29]Why are people fighting me?
[178:46.17]Got him.
[178:47.57]That horse died too.
[178:49.31]The horse was so distraught by his owner dying that he decided to fall down and die as well.
[178:54.43]Or he's pretending to be dead.
[178:56.23]That's a smart horse.
[178:57.91]Really smart horse.
[179:04.93]Well, you can't pretend anymore.
[179:12.23]There's no pretending now, Mr. Horse.
[179:18.06]Oh, God.
[179:18.52]I just skinned him.
[179:26.26]And now, here comes... Now I'm standing by all this evidence.
[179:29.03]That's great.
[179:30.39]This is wonderful.
[179:33.95]Horse, get over here.
[179:40.26]That's not going to go against my permanent record, right?
[179:50.22]Because if that goes against my permanent record, that's kind of bullshit.
[180:00.47]Right down here.
[180:02.82]I'm going to lasso this guy.
[180:10.03]So I do have a record.
[180:14.45]Okay, those are just random bystanders.
[180:16.95]That's fine.
[180:17.37]Cool.
[180:17.51]Alright, we're looking for... What's his name?
[180:24.26]Monster Mike?
[180:24.74]Or something?
[180:28.10]Do I have to, like, smell for this guy?
[180:29.52]Do I have to track him or something?
[180:33.41]You may choose to kill or capture.
[180:34.67]Well, I'm going to capture him.
[180:44.98]What?
[180:46.62]Is that an old lady?
[180:51.48]I think I have an old lady.
[180:52.90]Oh god, we gotta go.
[181:00.82]Okay, which one of them is Roscoe?
[181:17.26]No, I'm not shooting at you.
[181:18.08]I'm not shooting at you.
[181:18.82]I'm not shooting at you.
[181:20.24]Trust me.
[181:20.66]No!
[181:22.40]I was shooting at the eagle.
[181:24.12]I was shooting at the eagle.
[181:33.27]Is this tree good cover?
[181:36.13]Oh, fuck.
[181:41.57]God damn it.
[181:43.71]I don't want this.
[181:44.63]I didn't want this.
[181:50.26]Oh my god!
[181:50.84]Go, go!
[182:01.71]Where am I?
[182:07.09]I can't get out of here!
[182:09.04]Oh my fucking god, I couldn't leave!
[182:11.16]I couldn't leave the fucking tree, I was stuck in the fucking tree.
[182:21.13]I couldn't fucking move.
[182:32.18]Oh my god.
[182:32.96]Alright, let's go do that again.
[182:40.99]Oh, that's right, I do have Deadeye.
[182:46.18]Yeah, what started off as a joke turned into, like, a reality where I couldn't- Fuck me!
[182:51.22]Just get out of the way!
[182:52.18]That's not gonna count towards my permanent record, I hope not.
[183:13.19]We're going right in.
[183:14.11]I'm running in there and just annihilating.
[183:18.34]I'm going the right way, right?
[183:20.50]There's nothing even here.
[183:22.27]There's nothing out here.
[183:24.89]There's no mission anymore.
[183:28.27]There's no mission.
[183:29.35]It's over.
[183:35.09]Fucking, yeah, I got like a D- in Red Dead Redemption.
[183:39.98]Let's go to B.
[183:48.10]easy what is wrong what's going on what's happening right now come on come on let's go hey miss I got most of the horses secure and the chicken well thank you amos but it's the herd I'm worried about I know they're scattered all over the
[184:11.33]This is the worst mission coming up, somebody just said.
[184:13.18]This is the worst mission.
[184:14.10]This mission sucks.
[184:14.70]Oh, God.
[184:15.04]Great.
[184:15.28]You stupid man.
[184:15.72]It's a herding mission, isn't it?
[184:16.50]This is the worst mission in the game.
[184:18.12]This mission made me quit.
[184:19.14]Really?
[184:41.99]Oh.
[184:43.04]I can't wait.
[184:44.06]This is gonna be a blast.
[184:45.20]I can't wait to play the worst mission in the game.
[184:48.84]Honestly, people just decide to walk in front of me, okay?
[184:53.06]Like, when you're a toddler, you're taught to look both ways before crossing the road.
[184:57.92]I think we can handle that.
[185:00.16]That's what I'm- that's what I was told, and nobody does that.
[185:04.59]We're not gonna be able to hear each other in this rain.
[185:08.95]Just make sure you don't lose sight of me.
[185:15.54]Well, maybe I'll just be one of those people that does it really easily.
[185:18.88]Let me take this stupid waypoint thing off my screen.
[185:31.15]Let's go.
[185:35.03]He had the right of way.
[185:35.99]No, he didn't.
[185:36.29]He wasn't in a crosswalk.
[185:46.75]Alright, so here's some of the... Are these the ones that I need to... No, not those ones, apparently.
[185:51.45]Okay.
[185:52.75]No, it is these ones.
[185:53.99]Alright, well, I'm just going to go slow, then.
[186:01.93]I'm going slow.
[186:02.79]Do I have to get all 11?
[186:04.95]Well, we'll see.
[186:11.34]I don't know.
[186:11.64]Did one just go that way?
[186:13.42]I can't tell.
[186:14.04]Yeah, one did go this way.
[186:16.93]What are you doing?
[186:18.23]Get over there.
[186:26.36]Move near the straggler to return to the herd, the simple one.
[186:35.58]Okay.
[186:35.68]No, there goes another one.
[186:36.58]Go on.
[186:41.21]Go.
[186:41.45]Return.
[186:45.25]Return to the herd.
[186:51.69]That's not how cows work.
[186:55.49]Somebody just brought something really inappropriate.
[186:57.65]But like, it was kind of funny.
[187:07.25]And now they're all scared.
[187:09.25]Everybody's scared.
[187:15.84]Why did you get off the horse?
[187:18.58]Why did you get off the horse?
[187:22.52]Alright, come here.
[187:26.06]I'm going in front of the herd!
[187:30.64]I can only go so fast.
[187:31.92]Alright, in front of the herd.
[187:44.89]Now what?
[187:46.98]What are you doing?
[187:48.24]How do I?
[187:48.50]What am I supposed to do?
[187:49.90]Just knock?
[187:53.72]One just walked off.
[187:55.61]That one just walked off.
[188:01.01]Is that one gone?
[188:02.35]I didn't even see it fall.
[188:03.71]Fuck!
[188:05.75]Get back here!
[188:11.35]Come on!
[188:13.75]What are you doing?
[188:16.52]Come back this way.
[188:17.98]That's not the right way to go.
[188:20.02]I thought it said if I go close to them that they won't do this.
[188:23.66]Listen.
[188:24.56]It's not worth it.
[188:25.76]It's not worth it.
[188:26.64]Don't do it.
[188:27.78]It's not worth it.
[188:29.67]He didn't do it.
[188:30.31]Good.
[188:31.89]Listen.
[188:39.89]Do these ones not even matter anymore?
[188:42.37]I don't understand.
[188:46.85]They're everywhere.
[188:47.63]There's not even... There's no rhyme or reason.
[188:51.90]Okay.
[188:53.94]Got it.
[188:58.52]I was under the assumption that that was... I didn't want to lose them ever.
[189:05.14]There's another straggler.
[189:11.65]No.
[189:12.13]I don't even care.
[189:12.93]Give me a... Give me like a D on this.
[189:19.54]I have my gun ready in case somebody gets out of line.
[189:23.36]Like these two.
[189:27.22]Pick up the raindrops and come back in there.
[189:28.88]17, 18.
[189:30.68]How many do you have to have to pass?
[189:37.44]Is there a certain amount I need?
[189:40.89]No, no, no, no.
[189:42.27]Do not.
[189:42.89]Please go the other way.
[189:43.69]There you go.
[189:53.07]Nature remains imbalanced.
[189:58.27]I lost one, but the one that walked off the edge is the one we'll never get back.
[190:11.91]I wish I saw it too.
[190:13.15]I really didn't think he was gonna walk.
[190:14.64]I think he's dead.
[190:24.37]Almost there.
[190:28.43]Stick with it.
[190:31.86]Come back.
[190:35.86]I really like that they automatically run.
[190:40.97]They automatically run towards the... when they're straggled.
[190:46.78]Just drag them.
[190:48.02]Okay, now they're going faster.
[190:49.18]Why are they going so fast?
[190:49.94]Is the train gonna come and hit these fucking things?
[190:53.36]That would make me very upset.
[190:57.79]I would be very upset about that.
[190:59.91]Get in.
[191:01.75]Get in there.
[191:03.11]Hardest mission in the game.
[191:15.44]That was the hardest mission in the game?
[191:21.15]Oh, I would laugh my ass off if a train hit them.
[191:22.83]You better believe it.
[191:28.65]Plus 20.
[191:31.75]Alright.
[191:34.25]Plus 100 honor.
[191:39.81]No, it's not.
[191:40.49]Alright, let's go to W. Let's go to George W.'
[191:44.18]'s house.
[191:45.22]Just pay him a visit.
[191:50.79]Just gonna ride straight there.
[191:53.82]Lasso the woman and take them to the train tracks.
[191:57.72]No, I don't want to like instantly fail.
[192:02.30]Yeah, I herded cows on stream.
[192:03.82]I just herded cows.
[192:06.37]Like very well on stream.
[192:14.05]Instantly fail.
[192:14.81]What do you mean instantly fail?
[192:16.29]New weapons are available.
[192:17.19]I don't have any money, so why would I care?
[192:21.87]Chests?
[192:22.97]I don't see any.
[192:31.00]Beat the cow mission.
[192:31.96]Oh, we got a freaking geek.
[192:33.30]Is this guy getting attacked by wolves?
[192:37.58]He's dead.
[192:56.33]Okay.
[192:59.31]Bye.
[193:03.27]The hunter thing.
[193:05.19]Reading chat and not looking is not a good idea.
[193:08.84]That is a very bad idea.
[193:15.72]Turn, please.
[193:25.60]Can I get...
[193:32.40]Is this possible, do you think?
[193:33.68]Like, can I, like, slide down here?
[193:34.98]I might be able to.
[193:35.70]It's probably a bad idea.
[193:48.66]We're okay.
[193:51.06]Just, like, slide down.
[193:52.00]Just ride it like a wave.
[193:54.59]Okay, we're good.
[193:56.65]We're okay.
[193:58.61]Just had to ride it like a fucking wave.
[194:06.90]I'm trying to get on the horse!
[194:18.20]Oh shit.
[194:21.30]I was trying to get on the horse.
[194:24.67]Triangle and Y is get on thing.
[194:28.71]Fuck me.
[194:29.79]Oh well.
[194:31.25]It worked.
[194:33.79]Hey look, a bystander.
[194:35.35]Excuse me.
[194:37.78]Hold on, can you give me some directions?
[194:52.21]Got ya!
[194:57.41]Alright.
[195:00.01]I hear footsteps.
[195:01.91]I hear footsteps.
[195:03.23]Just don't move and then nothing will happen.
[195:23.72]And it's that guy, too.
[195:24.76]It's this fucking stupid guy.
[195:26.92]It's fucking Benjamin Franklin.
[195:29.14]I just... Alright, Jessica, wait.
[195:34.81]We'll do it again.
[195:35.29]If I did it before, I can do it again.
[195:37.37]If I did it before, I can do it again.
[196:05.57]I did it.
[196:06.29]It's okay.
[196:06.69]I fucking got away from the law.
[196:09.29]It's okay.
[196:12.38]Just rode it like a wave.
[196:13.32]That's all you gotta do.
[196:14.80]You just gotta ride it just like a surfer and you're gonna be fine.
[196:24.50]We're almost there.
[196:30.89]Nothing's gonna happen.
[196:31.89]We're fine.
[196:34.77]Is that a new speedrunning strat that you found?
[196:36.62]I don't know, maybe.
[196:40.70]Wait, this guy needs help?
[196:49.75]Who's the bad guy?
[196:50.67]Who's the bad guy?
[196:51.29]Which one's the bad guy?
[196:51.95]I don't know!
[196:56.39]Wait, wait, come here, horse!
[196:57.75]Wait, come here!
[196:58.55]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here!
[196:59.67]I need you, I need you, I need you, I need your help!
[197:02.70]Come here!
[197:04.34]Oh, God damn it.
[197:07.33]He's back.
[197:12.21]Wait.
[197:13.85]Didn't I skin this guy?
[197:22.42]Okay.
[197:27.62]Oh, dude.
[197:31.83]There is a stagecoach, though.
[197:34.95]Should I just, like, chalk this up as, like, cool, and I'll just... I mean, does everyone close your eyes?
[197:42.42]He was just playing.
[197:43.08]Yeah, his skin grew back.
[197:44.36]It's okay.
[197:48.60]That horse's skin grew back.
[197:54.56]Hey, easy!
[197:55.48]What the fuck?
[198:00.92]They just got back up.
[198:10.66]Okay.
[198:12.56]I want to loot the bodies, too.
[198:14.22]They might have something.
[198:14.92]Okay, for a second I thought that was just telling me to hide.
[198:18.04]I just saw, like, hide!
[198:20.44]It's like, wait, hide?
[198:21.48]Okay, I'll hide.
[198:28.55]Ammo, okay.
[198:31.45]Oh, come back here.
[198:32.05]I could take the stagecoach.
[198:35.49]But I don't want to loot.
[198:36.15]Well, 32 bucks, nice.
[198:39.79]Whatever, let's go.
[198:43.29]I'm gonna go to the W. There's another chi- Whoa, wait, it's right here.
[198:49.13]Wait.
[198:50.07]What's this?
[198:52.63]He's dead.
[198:53.69]That, the... This is the dad, right?
[198:57.79]Mustache man?
[199:02.11]Oh, no, it's a different guy.
[199:08.67]I said, no, I'm not okay.
[199:10.74]Do I look like I'm okay?
[199:13.09]You look pretty good for a corpse.
[199:15.41]Praise be.
[199:18.19]Move up, mister.
[199:20.29]Time to get you to a doctor.
[199:21.67]Or an undertaker.
[199:22.43]Whichever you need once we get to town.
[199:24.81]You know what?
[199:25.69]Open up them pearly gates.
[199:27.91]I'm coming home.
[199:28.89]How come there was no cowboy WWE wrestler?
[199:32.11]Are you serious?
[199:33.24]What's going on there?
[199:35.10]There was no pirate.
[199:36.14]There was no cowboy.
[199:37.28]There was no ninja.
[199:39.16]WWF wrestler.
[199:40.42]That's so much content available for them.
[199:41.90]Why not?
[199:42.16]How could you not do that?
[199:43.18]It was a pirate?
[199:44.55]Who was the pirate?
[200:06.43]The Undertaker wasn't a pirate.
[200:08.71]Head for Armadillo, friend.
[200:10.62]Alright.
[200:11.24]West Dicken.
[200:11.78]Press LT to draw a weapon while driving.
[200:13.08]You can aim and shoot normally and still be in control of the vehicle.
[200:15.46]You got it.
[200:15.96]I'm going to have to shoot a bunch of people.
[200:18.93]What is your name, friend?
[200:20.99]John Morstan.
[200:22.49]Oh, good God!
[200:26.14]I had to know.
[200:27.02]I had to just test.
[200:28.00]Now... Now, I'm going to a lot of bumps right now.
[200:30.72]He's already, like, dead.
[200:32.46]Didn't kill him.
[200:33.50]Now he's dead.
[200:34.68]There's still hope.
[200:55.15]When the meter reaches zero, Wes Dickens will fall and die.
[200:57.87]I'm going a different road here.
[200:58.97]But why is he taking damage?
[201:01.21]Why is he taking damage?
[201:03.31]He doesn't like the way we're going?
[201:05.47]You don't like the road we're taking?
[201:27.78]Dude, you can't even take a Universal Studios ride?
[201:31.30]Are you serious?
[201:34.99]Oh, no, I can't.
[201:35.87]You can't take me on the ride.
[201:37.21]I have a bad back.
[201:43.51]You give up.
[201:44.43]He's dead.
[201:46.81]What's wrong?
[201:51.65]Oh, he's bleeding.
[201:52.69]I didn't know he was bleeding.
[201:57.07]bleeding here.
[201:57.59]Did he get shot?
[202:04.04]Oh, he must have gotten shot.
[202:09.58]He's not bleeding right now.
[202:10.52]He gets shot here and he goes, I've been hit.
[202:12.79]I'm hit.
[202:13.27]I'm hit.
[202:13.91]I'm hit.
[202:14.51]I'm hit.
[202:15.45]I'm hit.
[202:31.64]Here we go!
[202:32.02]There's the auto-aim!
[202:32.72]Even he complained about it.
[202:33.80]That's funny.
[202:34.14]Maybe I'm just a terrible driver.
[202:35.08]I mean, that's probably what it is.
[202:36.46]Oh, fuck.
[202:36.76]We have to go off-road for a second.
[202:37.72]Just hold your breath.
[202:38.64]No, we don't.
[202:39.12]What?
[202:39.24]GPS updated.
[202:59.35]There was no GPS back then.
[203:00.95]Why wouldn't it fix me?
[203:01.71]Stay on the road.
[203:02.43]There's a couple of guys here.
[203:04.17]Are these bad guys?
[203:06.59]Yes, they are.
[203:24.23]I love that.
[203:24.91]Anakin.
[203:25.57]I'm too weak, Anakin.
[203:29.10]Anakin, please.
[203:34.90]Faster, faster.
[203:35.50]He says faster.
[203:36.04]You got it.
[203:38.88]Easy.

[203:41.16]You're good.
[203:41.66]We're there.
[203:43.06]We made it.
[203:51.57]Christ sakes, man.
[203:52.56]You're gonna be fine.
[203:53.60]We're nearly there.
[203:56.68]This is it.
[203:57.56]You're gonna make it.
[204:00.36]Where the devil are we?
[204:02.98]Armadillo.
[204:04.10]We made it safe.
[204:04.80]You'll be happy to know.
[204:05.64]Thank you, sir.
[204:08.45]Thank you.
[204:09.07]You're a gentleman and a true man of honor.
[204:12.75]Coming from you, I doubt that means much, but I appreciate the civility.
[204:18.29]I owe you, sir.
[204:20.28]I know I've never played this before.
[204:25.02]This is my first playthrough of the game.
[204:32.78]Ever.
[204:35.32]Dr. Oatgur.
[204:36.20]He kind of is Dr. Oatgur.
[204:37.48]He does look like him.
[204:42.23]Yeah, I avoided the Lannister joke.
[204:43.77]I didn't do it.
[204:44.85]There was an opportunity there.
[204:48.33]No, wait, why... Why the fuck was that... My, like, notifications weren't on screen.
[204:54.03]Well, that was annoying.
[204:55.01]Sorry, those of you that have been subbing and giving bits, my notifications were off.
[205:00.97]While you're watching... While you're waiting, you can further explore New Austin, which is a new area.
[205:04.53]Okay.
[205:05.83]Thank you, Gummy Monk, for the $5.
[205:07.03]Also, Mr. Hoon.
[205:12.00]And Ilvery again, for the bits.
[205:14.10]You guys rock.
[205:16.74]Thank you so much.
[205:18.91]And now my notifications are on.
[205:22.89]I missed your follow.
[205:24.58]Well, fuck.

[205:29.14]Oh, here's W. Let me just... I want to look and see what's available over here.
[205:32.92]For fun.
[205:33.42]Why not?
[205:37.48]Hey, Gunsmith.
[205:38.45]What do you got?
[205:39.39]How much money do I have?
[205:40.05]$37.
[205:40.23]Repeater, Buffalo Rifle.
[205:45.75]What is this?
[205:47.09]Doubles ammo capacity.
[205:48.11]Okay.
[205:48.33]Okay.

[205:56.08]Horse hide.
[205:57.10]Should I sell this stuff?
[205:59.02]Or do I- Should I use it for something?
[206:01.57]I never got a thanks for following.
[206:03.53]Jerma acknowledges followers.
[206:05.41]Well, I don't- I don't call out subs.
[206:08.77]I don't call out subscriptions.
[206:11.15]Currently, there's a lot in play there of- I want to build a, like, end of stream code thing.
[206:21.23]that shows everyone that subscribed in the different tiers and everything and I'll sit there at the end of the stream and talk about it.
[206:27.61]I want to do this first.
[206:29.07]I want to do M first.
[206:29.87]Let's go in here.
[206:30.49]No, I didn't want to do that.
[206:36.46]What are we preparing for here?
[206:37.56]I've been saying that for four months.
[206:38.96]I know.
[206:39.14]I really have.
[206:47.59]We've had this problem for months with this group of bandits who are getting drunk and murdering settlers.
[206:52.85]Last night they went to a big place up near Ridgewood.
[206:54.97]They burnt the place down, killed the men, burning most of them alive, and raped the women.
[207:00.01]Women both then got their throats slit.
[207:02.50]One of them survived and walked through the storm anyway.
[207:06.46]We got a posse gathering up near Ridgewood.
[207:09.28]Will you ride with us?
[207:11.62]I'll ride.
[207:13.22]Thank you, John Marston.
[207:14.90]It's gonna be a bloody job.
[207:18.75]Is it a Henry rifle?
[207:23.43]They are, aren't they?
[207:25.90]He's not even of legal drinking age.
[207:28.38]That's a four-month-old drinking.
[207:31.12]Let's go find the bandits.
[207:42.76]Alright, let's go.
[207:43.96]Shoot all their hats off?
[207:45.42]Okay.
[207:45.76]Let's see if I can get it.
[207:47.88]Can I get all their hats?
[207:49.02]I think I can get their hats if I try hard enough.
[207:50.84]I can't.
[207:51.26]Why am I using this shitty horse?
[207:52.60]I don't know.
[208:16.66]No, it's not gonna work.
[208:18.62]Deadeye?
[208:19.32]Do you use Deadeye for this?
[208:24.00]Nobody's allowed to have a hat.
[208:30.18]Come on!
[208:33.80]I can't, like, shoot... I got it!
[208:35.34]I got it!
[208:35.70]Okay, good, good, good.
[208:39.97]Oh, I shot him!
[208:40.49]I shot him in the...
[208:48.04]Brains came out.
[208:52.24]Trying to knock hats off.
[208:54.40]Trying to do his fucking brains out.
[208:57.58]Oh my god, that was fucking terrible.
[209:04.28]I thought you couldn't friendly fire anybody.
[209:09.92]There's nudity on this mission?
[209:12.84]Oh, well.
[209:14.00]What am I supposed to do?
[209:17.86]I'll censor it.
[209:23.13]Here, hold on.
[209:25.09]There's nudity here.

[211:44.38]Remove that.

[213:32.68]I was like looking around at stuff.
[213:40.54]That wasn't a joke.

[216:34.24]Okay.
[216:39.86]Just get my horse over here just in case I need it.

[218:17.80]Who's out there?
[218:19.72]Oh, fuck.
[218:26.72]Are these people dead?
[218:27.84]I don't understand.
[218:28.38]Are these guys dead?
[218:30.46]I don't know.
[218:31.38]I think they're... They were dead.
[218:35.41]Those guys were all dead.
[218:37.03]Every single one of them.
[218:38.45]I didn't do anything.
[218:39.67]I shot one guy peeking out in the corner.
[218:46.13]Don't ever peek.
[218:46.90]Don't you know?
[218:57.17]I got him.
[218:59.59]I got ya.
[219:02.95]Alright, shoot him.

[219:30.43]No more jokes, please.
[219:33.96]Easy on the jokes.
[219:35.40]It's not worth it.
[219:36.28]Take the fucking gun out and shoot the guy.
[219:38.12]Oh!
[219:38.46]Holy shit.
[219:43.06]That was a knee-jerk reaction.
[219:45.38]And it's fine.
[220:07.45]I'm shocked that I did not kill that lady.
[220:11.83]Where's everybody going?
[220:13.08]Outside?
[220:13.48]There's spit coming down my mouth.
[220:20.40]I'm drooling.
[220:29.90]Thirst for blood.
[220:30.42]$50?
[220:30.44]Holy shit.
[221:01.74]That's a lot of money.
[221:06.48]Oh, I can't do it?
[221:16.35]You won't let me do it?
[221:19.65]Oh, come on.
[221:22.25]Let me search the house.
[221:23.01]There's probably stuff in here.
[221:30.64]Can't go in that door.
[221:42.60]Okay, I can't, I cannot... I can't, uh, I can't go check that one.
[221:50.51]So, fuck it, whatever.
[221:54.93]I'll find those rotten bandits.
[221:59.80]Alright, our sensor bar can go off.
[222:02.24]We're good.
[222:02.74]Alright, move.
[222:11.35]Get that 50 bucks.
[222:13.09]And then use that to buy Red Dead Redemption 2.
[222:17.87]Coming soon.
[222:19.02]And by coming soon, I mean coming in like a year.
[222:22.64]I'm starving.
[222:23.62]I need something to eat.
[222:24.90]I need like a fucking hot dog.
[222:27.44]Should I eat a hot dog?
[222:28.34]Should I get like a... What time is it?

[222:42.17]Bandit fight!
[222:42.75]Well, calling him out, for sure.
[223:07.15]You always did have a high opinion of yourself, John.
[223:10.27]Wait, isn't that the... Dutch always said you were an arrogant son of a bitch.
[223:16.16]I'm this guy, like, at the beginning of the game.
[223:19.38]Get him, boys!
[223:20.32]Everybody, take cover!
[223:25.72]That took a little longer than expected.
[223:29.52]Get him, boys, but wait till they get behind cover before you start shooting.
[223:33.26]That's only fair, boys!
[223:40.20]Holy shit, there's a lot of people coming.
[223:50.55]Nice.
[223:51.33]Got ya.
[223:56.64]Gotta reload.
[223:59.20]They're getting really close.
[224:13.54]Shoot their hats off.
[224:15.26]My hat's off to you.
[224:20.46]Come on.
[224:22.33]Where are you shooting me from?
[224:23.33]Over there?
[224:31.66]Come on!
[224:32.88]Oh, fuck this guy.
[224:42.29]That's not what I wanted to do.
[224:43.55]Get me back in the house.
[224:45.37]Get in the house.
[224:46.13]Stop flailing around.
[224:47.63]Get down to cover, please.
[224:49.77]Ow.
[225:04.99]And accurate.
[225:05.53]Is this more accurate?
[225:07.67]Is the revolver accurate?
[225:10.65]Not really.
[225:17.80]No.
[225:18.18]Not at all.
[225:18.62]This is definitely more accurate.
[225:25.32]Okay.
[225:27.30]Fuck off.
[225:31.09]Alright.
[225:31.57]Guy behind the rock and guy behind the box.
[225:36.20]There it is, right in the head.
[225:37.16]We win.
[225:38.22]Nah, I don't want to use Deadeye.
[225:40.60]I'm better than that.
[225:41.76]Am I gonna, like, step on his head or something?
[225:45.84]Nice.
[226:00.48]Hey, you're welcome.
[226:01.10]Too bad I got the shotgun instead of the volcanic pistol.
[226:04.84]So we tie him up and put him on the horse, right?
[226:06.88]It's already done.
[226:08.74]Damn, money does not come easy in this game.
[226:29.00]It really doesn't.
[226:30.30]You gotta work for your shit here, huh?
[226:31.66]Alright, where are we going?
[226:36.96]Oh, let's get a map.
[226:37.96]Oh, I wanted to do this.
[226:40.42]I want to do, uh, Alice Sandra McGee's American Nightmare, whatever it's called.
[226:54.49]I was thinking about it.
[227:05.88]Got 50 bucks for a gang.
[227:09.88]A train!
[227:10.68]Oh wait, is this the joke?
[227:12.48]Is this the joke that I'm gonna do?
[227:13.33]Is this the joke that you've seen everybody do like five times?
[227:16.61]Oh no, look out for the train!
[227:20.27]It's coming!
[227:22.13]Oh my god, did you see that stream when the guy like got hit by the fucking train?! !
[227:34.57]I'm fucking laughing about it a little bit, just a tiny bit.
[227:37.85]I'm fucking laughing about it just a little bit, a tiny bit.
[227:47.50]Good job, funny streamer.
[227:48.66]Funny.
[227:49.06]Oh, funny.
[227:49.70]Oh, I died.
[227:51.26]I died.
[227:51.92]Wasn't that funny?
[228:01.77]You can push the horse.
[228:04.26]Come on.
[228:05.34]Come on.
[228:06.23]Let's see that diarrhea.
[228:07.55]Come on.
[228:08.89]Show it to me.
[228:12.31]I want to examine your fucking feces to make sure you don't have any worms.
[228:20.27]Oh, well.
[228:20.79]Oh, B is right here.
[228:24.55]Look at me.
[228:24.99]I'm a Jerma.
[228:25.31]Look at me.
[228:25.57]Okay.
[228:25.67]Let's go.
[228:33.19]Go to B.
[228:36.88]Somebody clip that and use it out of context?
[228:38.70]You know what you could get?
[228:40.42]You know what would get a good laugh?
[228:42.18]Getting your free DLC horse and looting corpses for quick money.
[228:44.94]I already did the DLC horse.
[228:45.81]It's cheating.
[228:46.21]Warhorse.
[228:46.45]Look.
[229:06.46]Here comes my warhorse, right?
[229:08.50]So I don't need this horse anymore.
[229:12.92]Now let him, let's let him go, right?
[229:15.52]Let him just go do his own thing.
[229:19.93]Like, I don't need to kill him.
[229:21.31]He's gonna do his own thing.
[229:22.33]He'll go off in the wilderness and like eat birds and shit, whatever water horses do.
[229:28.85]He'll like nibble on some grass.
[229:32.30]There, here's my DLC horse.
[229:33.75]Everyone wants me to use it.
[229:35.45]Oh my fucking god.
[229:47.76]No, I don't... I... I missed!
[229:51.14]And I missed!
[229:52.12]It's a sign.
[229:53.02]It's a sign.
[229:54.38]It's a sign.
[229:54.88]I was just really angry at that horse for making me stay there for too long.
[229:58.33]Give me my other horse.
[230:01.83]Come on.
[230:06.37]Wait, I got my horse.
[230:08.39]Just wait, come on.
[230:12.13]He's still coming with us.
[230:14.81]My other horse is coming with us too.
[230:17.31]Come on, let's go.
[230:18.03]Might as well.
[230:18.91]He's gone.
[230:19.31]Really pretty outside at night like this.

[230:47.93]When do you run into Easy Pete in this game?
[230:49.95]That's a good question.

[232:33.54]Find another way in.
[232:37.43]Should I just run in?
[233:04.13]I wanted him to hit me in the face with the axe.
[233:06.83]I know the game's not gonna do that.
[233:18.20]I didn't do anything, by the way.
[233:19.50]I didn't even punch.
[233:23.72]I was trying to punch him, but I didn't even attempt to punch him.
[233:28.37]Jesus Christ.

[243:46.03]Is it up here still?
[243:49.13]Oh, that was lame.
[243:50.09]I think the stagecoach kept going.
[243:54.95]That wasn't worth it at all.
[243:56.19]I didn't know he was gonna get that scared.
[243:59.25]Like, enough to leave.
[244:00.01]Okay, I'm going up to a hideout.
[244:08.98]Let's just take the ride.
[244:10.00]Why not?
[244:10.40]It'll be fun.
[244:17.25]You're nearing a gang hideout.
[244:18.41]That's cool.
[244:27.22]That guy almost just ran right off the fucking cliff.
[244:43.21]I just got, like, stuck.
[244:44.23]It was annoying.
[244:46.13]Jump?
[244:46.63]No, there was no good place to ride the wave there.
[244:48.92]I was thinking about it.
[244:49.56]Alright, there's a stagecoach.
[244:55.14]I want a stagecoach.
[244:57.14]Get my fucking... Seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously.

[245:30.10]I want to, like, get in the back of the stagecoach.
[245:31.49]Come on.
[245:43.63]I don't care.
[245:49.02]Oh, there goes a witness.
[245:49.88]I'm kinda hoping he just runs off the cliff.
[245:59.08]What is this guy doing over here?
[246:00.76]Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[246:02.46]What are you doing?
[246:09.03]What is this guy looking at?
[246:10.03]Why are you standing in the perfect spot to get fucking pushed off a cliff?
[246:19.88]Like, what the fuck are you doing, dude?
[246:22.26]Why were you there?
[246:25.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[246:26.78]What do you mean this task isn't available?
[246:32.36]What?
[246:34.72]Hold on.
[246:35.70]Hold on.
[246:36.44]I can't.
[246:36.92]There's a mission I can't do now?
[246:41.90]Shit.
[246:43.96]We got this.
[246:44.36]Strategy.
[246:45.12]Strategy.
[246:58.40]That was a subscriber.
[247:04.70]I thought for a second I was going to be able to lift through that one.
[247:07.82]Okay, hey, so what are we doing?
[247:09.32]We're riding the coach to... Yeah, we're going to go.
[247:11.67]Oh, look at how dumb this looks.
[247:13.77]I need to do this.
[247:15.31]I want to get on this fucking tricycle.
[247:19.07]How do I get this guy off the tricycle without getting in trouble?
[247:23.41]There has to be a way, right?
[247:24.75]How do I get him off this so I can ride the tricycle?
[247:28.88]No.
[247:29.54]No, you're not gonna do that.
[247:30.54]No!
[247:31.08]I said no.
[247:34.54]Oh, I wanna ride the fucking tricycle so bad.
[247:36.17]Oh, whatever.
[247:39.27]Fucking... Let's just... Let me get on the stagecoach.

[247:47.59]Right there?
[247:49.27]Lasso?
[247:49.78]No, I can't.
[247:50.24]If I lasso, I'm gonna get in trouble.
[247:54.76]Just bribe him immediately?
[247:55.70]Okay.
[247:57.06]I'll try it.

[249:40.89]He grew back.
[249:41.61]I seem to know you.
[249:43.75]I'm pretty good at remembering faces.
[249:45.87]Are you?
[249:47.03]Do you remember Hattie McCourt's face?
[249:50.25]Who?
[249:51.57]She was a girl, Dutch Vanderlyn, shot in the head on that raid on the ferry.
[249:54.79]Talking to Satan?
[249:55.19]What do you mean Satan?
[249:56.35]Same one you got shot on.

[250:03.79]Should have pushed him.
[250:05.71]Not really.
[250:06.39]Should have pushed him.
[250:07.41]Then why would you remember me, friend?
[250:09.61]You've forgotten far more important people than me.
[250:14.81]What's your game, friend?
[250:16.65]What is your game?
[250:17.61]I don't have a game, John.
[250:20.21]Listen, sometimes I just wish I'd known more about
[250:25.68]He landed on his top hat, and it cushioned his fall.
[250:30.63]Yeah, he landed right on the crown of his head, and it's, like, Tempur-Pedic, so it fucking, like, absorbed it.
[250:35.73]I think he's going to be unfaithful to his dear wife.
[250:40.45]Why don't you head over there and see if you can advise him how best to proceed?
[250:46.87]What do you think I am?
[250:49.37]John.

[254:13.68]Get off the horse!
[254:14.56]Oh, goddammit!
[254:22.26]I was trying to ghost ride him.
[254:23.62]I was trying to jump off the horse.
[254:30.61]He wouldn't jump off.
[254:31.61]There was a will help screen.
[254:37.32]What happened?
[254:41.28]What happened?
[254:41.78]Did I just get kicked out of the game?
[254:50.71]I got like booted to the main menu.
[254:59.24]When was the last save?
[255:00.44]Okay, no, I'm good.
[255:04.30]Well, okay.
[255:07.00]10 to D Rangoon, like 10 to Dragoon, 74.
[255:17.11]Xbox is sick of my shit.
[255:18.77]I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun.
[255:22.81]The free demo ended.
[255:27.88]Yeah, I ran out of fucking game time on Gamefly.
[255:31.30]I had to return the game.
[255:33.22]No, well, GameTap.
[255:33.96]What was the name of that thing where you paid for the service to play games?
[255:36.56]GameTap.
[255:44.12]Let me tell the gamertag story.
[255:45.74]I didn't give a flying fuck what my name was.
[255:48.06]That's a randomly generated gametag.
[255:51.02]And whatever the first one was, I didn't even care.
[256:00.81]Got an avatar award.
[256:02.23]Okay.
[256:02.45]Alright, let's try this again.
[256:06.64]Let's go.
[256:11.02]I still have a game from Gamefly that I never returned.
[256:14.92]Holy shit.
[256:16.98]That's a long, that's a long time.
[256:18.76]Does Gamefly still exist?
[256:25.91]I gotta go this way.
[256:31.68]Alright, let's just ride.
[256:47.15]Bandits or something?
[256:47.89]Bandits?
[256:48.31]What's this?
[256:53.44]What?
[256:53.60]I don't... What just fucking happened?
[256:57.36]What just happened?
[256:58.24]I don't even know what the fuck happened.
[257:00.82]I just fucking rode over there and I had my lasso equipped.
[257:04.00]What the fuck was that?
[257:05.06]Like... Hostage was executed.
[257:14.45]I didn't even know there was a hostage.
[257:19.61]How was I supposed to know that?
[257:20.67]Watch out for the saw.
[257:22.83]Look, I want this back.
[257:23.89]I want this back now.
[257:27.75]Like, seriously.
[257:28.44]Like, I'm going to do the thing I did the last time.
[257:30.04]It was like, oh, shit, you got me.
[257:31.22]But that was just a funny joke.
[257:37.40]That didn't do anything.
[257:41.46]He's still on it.
[257:42.37]Get off of that.
[257:43.13]Oh, my.
[257:43.67]No, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[257:45.05]Wait, hey, hey.
[257:48.01]What?
[257:48.93]Just... We're tracking you down.
[257:53.68]That's fine.
[257:54.20]Go ahead.
[257:54.84]Fucking make a run for it.
[257:56.50]Go on.
[257:56.96]Come on.
[257:57.76]Come on, horse.
[257:58.20]I need you now.
[257:59.24]I need you right now.
[258:00.00]Let's go.
[258:00.36]Let's go.
[258:00.78]Let's go.
[258:01.13]Need you now.
[258:03.41]Get over here.
[258:03.91]Now.
[258:04.71]Come on.
[258:05.43]You fucking stupid horse.
[258:09.05]Come on.
[258:19.88]God damn it.
[258:23.28]I'm so angry right now.
[258:27.54]I wanted to track that guy down so bad.
[258:30.61]But, like, I pressed square accidentally.
[258:32.71]Okay, wait, wait.
[258:35.85]Is there, like, a hostage situation over there?
[258:37.37]Nope.
[258:37.75]Not this time.
[258:44.72]Let's go.
[258:51.77]No resets allowed.
[258:52.80]Time to jump off the cliff and try again.
[258:56.08]What's this?
[259:38.03]I... I can't play these games.
[259:40.55]You guys understand?
[259:41.31]I hope you guys, like, understand that I can't do this.
[259:46.54]You give me, like, an open world game, I can't be trusted.
[259:48.60]No matter what.
[259:50.98]Literally no matter what.
[259:53.20]I can never be trusted.
[259:55.71]Wait, there's a skunk?
[259:56.24]Are you serious?
[259:58.20]How did I... There's a witness, too.
[260:05.58]Whatever.
[260:05.84]I don't care anymore.
[260:14.97]Is that the witness right there?
[260:18.18]Whatever.
[260:18.54]Who cares?
[260:19.06]Fucking bounty.
[260:24.87]I can't make it down this.
[260:28.13]I definitely can.
[260:32.97]Yeah, we're fine.
[260:36.38]No, don't!
[260:39.96]How is this guy still on the horse?
[260:41.32]I have no idea.
[260:45.64]Do I care about the side missions?
[260:47.02]I mean, I... Sort of, but at the same time, not really.
[260:50.37]I'm just trying to fuck around.
[260:59.19]Alright, we're good.
[261:00.63]We made it out.
[261:05.69]We made it out alive.
[261:10.56]Hooray.
[261:11.26]Did the guy on the back of the horse just say that to me?
[261:19.76]What brings you out this way?
[261:33.79]No, wait, don't move around.
[261:38.85]Alright, you're free to go.
[261:44.69]Alright, you go ahead.
[261:50.86]You're free.
[261:51.56]Have fun.
[261:51.88]Make sure to subscribe.

[262:03.09]Okay.
[262:07.86]Uh, we can do this next part.
[262:10.26]Is it in here or is it in the other way?
[262:11.94]I don't know.
[262:16.17]Kidnapping for subs.
[262:17.47]I know, right?
[262:21.94]Kidnapping for something.
[262:23.88]Wait, what?
[262:24.24]Bonnie's getting hung?
[262:25.06]Uh oh.
[262:52.64]It's a big turning point of the game, right?
[262:54.14]If you want to see your daughter again, make sure you follow me on Facebook.
[262:59.60]Even better.
[263:01.56]Good day, Mr. McFarlane.
[263:03.53]Get down from that horse, boy, or I'll shoot.
[263:07.19]I wouldn't recommend that, mister.
[263:08.49]Oh, it's Johnny Depp.
[263:09.39]Not if Drew McFarlane wants to see his bunny back in one piece.
[263:12.75]Hey, Mr. McFarlane.
[263:14.59]There's a nice girl you got there.
[263:16.57]Get down from there.
[263:18.49]You know, part of me's got to thinking I should just marry her myself.
[263:22.84]Give her a baby and that.
[263:23.80]He just goes, I'm going to fucking eat you.
[263:26.02]That's better.
[263:29.48]I want Norm and Deke.
[263:31.62]I want them set free.
[263:33.72]Norm and Deke.
[263:34.16]Get your daughter back, mister.
[263:36.50]We don't do deals with outlaws, boy.
[263:39.02]Yeah, you do.
[263:40.91]Let's not waste each other's time pretending otherwise.
[263:44.33]Whole government themselves ain't much more than a bunch of crooks.
[263:48.60]This is the land of opportunity, mister.
[263:51.60]And I'm giving you the opportunity to get your donor back.
[263:54.52]Well, that's nice of you, thanks.
[263:55.74]The four fifteen friends of mine take out all their anger and their loneliness on her.
[264:01.68]Where the hell is she?
[264:02.52]Where is she, boy?
[264:04.54]Bring Deke up to Tumbleweed in a couple hours.
[264:07.54]And don't get no funny ideas.
[264:09.56]Which one's actually Deke?
[264:12.98]You boys have a pleasant afternoon.
[264:14.99]Yeah!
[264:17.80]okay let's go zero iq what are you talking about grand theft horse that's a that's a pretty good one that's a good one I like that one
[264:47.31]So I gotta go rescue Bonnie.
[264:56.04]I will not.
[264:59.22]If there's one thing I can promise you, I'm going to save that girl.
[265:02.69]Is that the guy that I had?
[265:04.83]Is that one of my subscribers?
[265:07.67]Hey, wait a minute.
[265:08.47]What streamer is this?
[265:12.12]What streamer is, like, getting a subscriber right now?
[265:14.70]Who is that?
[265:15.20]What's his license plate say?
[265:16.02]What's his twitch.tv?
[265:16.60]What is this joke?
[265:17.22]I don't even know.
[265:17.84]That's a good question.
[265:18.76]I have no fucking idea.
[265:37.27]Rabbit.
[265:37.73]Shit.
[265:38.25]Wrong gun.
[265:38.79]Get this one.
[265:39.99]Streamer duel.
[265:41.09]If I can't have that subscriber, then nobody can.
[265:58.58]I'm not going to do that.
[265:59.82]I want to shoot this guy in the head instead of head.
[266:01.66]I want this guy to get shot right in the face.
[266:04.80]Like right now.
[266:05.90]He's just a cowardly.
[266:06.70]He's a cowardly lion.
[266:25.91]For his sake, they'd best not have laid a finger on Miss McFarlane.
[266:32.70]What is this place we're in?
[266:33.84]Where are we going?
[266:34.68]Humbleweed, the lonely god forsaken land.
[266:36.48]Why don't you use Deadeye?
[266:37.34]Because I'm terrible and I keep forgetting that it exists.
[266:40.34]That's why.
[266:40.90]Then they built the railroad to Armadillo and went clean past Humbleweed.
[266:44.82]That was that.
[266:45.52]Pretty soon everybody had upped to the left.
[266:48.15]Alright, this person's name.
[266:51.09]I got a shout-out to this person's name.
[266:53.07]FrenchFryFrog1211221111222.
[266:58.07]You have the fucking most ridiculous Twitch name I've ever seen.
[267:00.54]It's all in capitals.
[267:01.54]It's fucking, it's a mess.
[267:02.52]That's such a good throwaway account.
[267:04.02]I love it.
[267:05.24]I wouldn't have been running in it
[267:18.18]Shout out.
[267:19.01]Bird.
[267:19.93]Bird.
[267:20.43]Got him.
[267:21.01]Oh, God.
[267:21.69]We're in emote only.
[267:23.25]Emote only mode.
[267:23.99]Yeah.
[267:49.42]How much further are we going to go here?
[267:50.42]So I'm really enjoying this game so far.
[267:51.84]I think it's really fun.
[267:52.82]I think it's really interesting.
[267:54.26]So you will see this game on Tuesday.
[268:05.93]I will be streaming this game on Tuesday as well.
[268:09.11]We're probably going to complete this whole game on stream.
[268:11.71]At least enough of it.
[268:12.49]Because this is... I'm having fun.
[268:14.37]I like it.
[268:15.27]It was a joke made when you made... When I was playing Jason Voorhees.
[268:30.02]What about rat simulator?
[268:32.00]This is a long fucking ride.
[268:33.42]This is a very long ride.
[268:34.73]Yeah, no dumb midway jokes here.
[268:53.15]Because I don't want to have to do this whole ride again.
[268:54.77]Get me to a checkpoint before I make any stupid jokes.
[268:58.01]Or attempt to make any fucking jokes.
[268:59.47]Because that's not going to be good.
[269:06.66]I thought about it.
[269:07.18]I did think about it, but I'm not going to lie.
[269:16.73]Okay.
[269:17.13]Now, here we go.
[269:19.10]Alright, I'm gonna be bringing the prisoner to town.
[269:22.79]Is that guy using his hand as binoculars?
[269:24.01]He's got a golden gun.
[269:25.09]Wait, is that my golden gun?
[269:27.19]Why is my gun golden?
[269:28.63]What is going on here?
[269:29.81]Why is this thing a golden gun?
[269:50.19]This is a DLC?
[269:50.81]We're gonna get turned on here.
[269:52.39]Yeah, where's Bonnie?
[269:53.41]Guy on the roof!
[269:56.35]Guy on the roof!
[269:57.47]Guy on the roof!
[270:19.02]I saw that before it even happened.
[270:21.00]Guy on the roof.
[270:24.70]You thought I wasn't gonna see that shit?
[270:27.79]I got fuckin' eyes like a goddamn eagle.
[270:48.98]Got any more guys on the roof?
[270:51.96]Over here?
[270:55.12]I gotta loot some people.
[270:55.88]I gotta loot some bodies here.
[271:01.28]Oh, shit.
[271:02.54]Wait a minute!
[271:02.96]Hey!
[271:03.74]Oh!
[271:05.86]Ho!
[271:08.75]Whoa!
[271:09.65]Ho!
[271:12.65]Where is he?
[271:12.93]Where's this guy?
[271:13.29]There's a guy, like, right here!
[271:14.19]Where is he?
[271:18.90]I'm gonna shoot that rope!
[271:19.46]I'm gonna shoot the rope!
[271:20.20]Shoot the rope!
[271:21.16]Shoot the rope!
[271:24.38]Got it!
[271:24.62]Alright, she's gonna be okay.
[271:29.70]She's gonna be fine.
[271:30.78]Bad spot.
[271:39.81]This is not a good spot.
[271:41.31]This is a better spot.
[271:48.10]Fucking lord.
[271:48.84]Alright, here comes fucking... Here comes Deadeye.
[272:00.65]I was getting like stuck in the fucking wall.
[272:03.85]Give me a break.
[272:12.64]Like I'm fucking glitching into the fucking wallpaper.
[272:17.37]That was such bullshit.
[272:18.61]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[272:25.40]Yeah, I know.
[272:30.31]She's gonna die.
[272:30.97]She's getting murdered.
[272:31.61]I understand.
[272:49.74]I can't- I'm not- I'm not- Can you- Can you shoot the fucking rope?
[273:05.22]If you could shoot the rope, please.
[273:07.30]Shoot the rope.
[273:09.10]Shoot the rope.
[273:13.04]Holy shit.
[273:18.21]What the fuck?
[273:22.11]I'm fine now, Mr. Marston.
[273:24.17]Thank you.
[273:25.47]Thank you.
[273:28.01]What the hell took you so long, you stupid man?
[273:30.56]Well, you weren't exactly helping me.
[273:34.28]If you think I'm gonna lower myself by making a joke about being all tied up, you got another thing coming.
[273:40.80]Come on.
[273:44.21]That was a heavy cough.
[273:46.51]She might have something.
[273:47.13]That sounds like there's fluid in those lungs.
[273:51.52]She might have pneumonia.
[274:01.73]Just kidding.
[274:02.29]I'm not going to do that.
[274:03.07]Let me save this game.
[274:09.43]Let me get it saved.
[274:16.35]Where are we at now?
[274:18.67]Pulled the map.
[274:19.35]We're far away.
[274:20.77]Oh, wait.
[274:21.45]There's a stranger over here.
[274:25.25]Check this, where this is.
[274:33.35]And then after this, I think I'm going to call it a night.
[274:36.89]Because I still want to get food.
[274:38.57]And a lot of places are going to be closed in the next...
[274:42.90]In the next, like, 40 minutes or so, most of the places to get food around here are going to close.
[274:47.77]And I need something to eat.
[274:51.45]What, we can go for, like, five hours?
[274:54.19]Just about, like, five hours?
[274:55.09]That's what I wanted.
[274:57.39]I wanted, like, a five-hour stream today.
[275:05.48]Wait.
[275:08.12]Bad guys?
[275:10.42]Where's our bad guy?
[275:16.62]Okay, that was easy.
[275:17.56]Wait a minute.
[275:17.88]Last guy.
[275:19.55]Shit.
[275:22.59]I want to capture this guy.
[275:30.37]Lasso this guy and get him.
[275:33.67]That's not the lasso.
[275:34.73]There's the lasso.
[275:39.25]Are you... That's not the right guy.
[275:43.34]God damn it.
[275:45.27]I didn't want to come in here, guys.
[275:46.85]I'm sorry.
[275:48.41]And I'm stuck in the fucking hay.
[275:50.96]Oh my fucking god.
[275:53.16]How do I get myself in these scenarios?
[275:54.92]I don't understand.
[275:55.54]I got him.
[276:11.02]Okay.
[276:20.14]No, wait.
[276:20.92]I don't want to kill him.
[276:24.60]I don't want to kill him.
[276:25.32]I just want to drag him over here.
[276:27.96]He's just a little fucking caterpillar right now.
[276:29.90]No big deal.
[276:33.29]Is this going to kill him?
[276:34.43]Will this kill him if I keep doing this?
[276:38.45]I mean, he's still alive.
[276:39.27]He's okay.
[276:40.99]He's not dead yet.
[276:41.87]He's going to be fine.
[276:46.16]He's fine.
[276:48.08]He's in his head on like rocks and shit.
[276:54.20]He's in his head like 15 times.
[276:57.48]He's in his head way too many times.
[277:00.50]Oh, wait a minute.
[277:01.24]Wait a minute.
[277:01.72]Wait a minute.
[277:02.10]Oh, come on.
[277:02.86]This is funny.
[277:04.12]This is gonna be funny.
[277:08.50]Alright, let's go.
[277:18.80]Come on.
[277:24.02]He's still alive.
[277:27.59]He's not- Oh!
[277:29.13]Wait, a prisoner escaped!
[277:31.91]What do you mean he escaped?
[277:34.41]I got him right here.
[277:36.39]He didn't escape, he's fucking in my hand.
[277:42.04]This dude has not escaped.
[277:45.74]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[277:48.60]Yeah, this guy escaped, oh no!
[277:53.92]He's still alive.
[278:00.56]He's still okay.
[278:02.74]He's good.
[278:07.05]You can even see- OW!
[278:12.47]Oh, it hurts!
[278:12.89]Uh oh, is there no movement anymore?
[278:15.93]Oh god, alright.
[278:16.79]How do I go full speed?
[278:17.91]How do I go full speed?
[278:20.53]Nope, nope.
[278:23.69]I lost him.
[278:29.74]Where is he?
[278:36.24]I want to grab this guy off the fucking back.
[278:45.58]Dude, slow it down.
[278:47.30]Slow it down.
[278:48.08]You're going way too fast.
[278:58.22]Got him.
[278:58.74]Ah, shit.
[279:02.34]I can't get this guy?
[279:03.12]Why not?
[279:03.58]I'm like right up his ass.
[279:10.27]How can I not grab this guy?
[279:11.57]He's literally right there.
[279:20.15]Apparently, I can't lasso this dude.
[279:22.67]Off the back.
[279:28.33]I'm gonna get kicked off the horse.
[279:31.31]I could shoot him, but that's not like... Alright, you know what?
[279:36.82]Fine, fuck it.
[279:37.34]We're all gonna shoot him.
[279:40.20]Fucking dumbass asshole.
[279:43.12]Alright, there was a friend back here.
[279:44.31]Where was he?
[279:44.63]Alright, what's up?
[279:48.03]What do I need to do?
[279:53.58]Who's this guy?
[279:54.02]What does this guy need?
[279:58.80]Stop moving!
[279:59.40]Stop it, stop it, stop it!
[280:03.16]Stop it!
[280:05.25]Just stop it!
[280:12.31]Stop it!
[280:15.81]No, just... Okay, I gotta run.
[280:19.36]All I did was make that guy trip.
[280:23.57]Wait a minute, can these guys get hit by the train?
[280:25.39]No, I'm gonna die.
[280:31.80]Random horse.
[280:32.72]Uh, yeah, sure, I'll take it.
[280:34.62]Alright, should I take these guys on like a magical mystery ride?
[280:39.74]Alright, we're gonna lure these guys to the train.
[280:43.59]Whichever way.
[280:44.03]Does it come this way?
[280:48.01]I mean, I'm pretty much done streaming right now, so I might as well just have somebody get hit by a train, right?
[281:00.68]I mean, eventually here I want to like lasso like fucking 30 people and put them all on the tracks and have the train run them all over.
[281:07.76]So like I want to do that.
[281:09.86]So like next stream we're gonna do... We're gonna do like a fucking... It's gonna take like 45 minutes.
[281:18.42]Oh, stranger.
[281:20.75]Should I still do that?
[281:22.53]Train is like really far away.
[281:23.69]Yeah, it's too far away at this point.
[281:25.49]Let's just go to the stranger.
[281:40.52]Hello.
[281:41.68]Bye.
[281:45.08]Yeah, so I'm going to have to do that.
[281:47.49]How many people can possibly be on the screen at the same time?
[281:53.41]Will they stay there?
[281:54.05]If I tie people up, if the train is really far away and I go get like 35 people, will it actually work?
[282:02.25]That's important.
[282:07.62]This guy's going real fast.
[282:15.30]Treasure.
[282:16.96]Treasure.
[282:17.28]And, okay, and again, we have... Again, we have the wrong fucking thing equipped.
[282:25.97]Where is he?
[282:33.84]Where is he?
[282:34.16]This guy's fucking invincible.
[282:37.34]I...
[282:43.37]Alright, that's it.
[282:44.25]See you on Tuesday.
[282:45.19]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[282:46.73]I'm fucking done.
[282:51.72]I'll see you guys on Tuesday for more Red Dead.
[282:53.62]We're gonna start fresh.
[282:58.92]I'm just, like, dicking around.
[283:01.76]So I have a save here.
[283:02.72]Might as well just fucking do something terrible, right?
[283:17.25]Let's do something awful.
[283:19.65]We're gonna play like roulette.
[283:25.55]We're gonna play human being roulette.
[283:34.75]Alright, I just want a friend.
[283:36.27]I just want you to come play horseshoes with me.
[283:46.56]Can I go in here with him?
[283:49.01]I can't.
[283:51.81]What?
[283:53.39]Oh, fuck it.
[283:54.01]Whatever.
[284:00.21]This is what you get.
[284:01.65]Like, you know what?
[284:02.41]You get this.
[284:03.56]I can't hit him.
[284:06.26]Okay.
[284:06.40]I'm not doing that.
[284:12.38]I ain't ending the stream like that.
[284:16.10]Oh fu- hush.
[284:19.10]Alright that's it.
[284:23.10]We're gonna pick this up tomorrow. I mean- not tomorrow, Tuesday. We will get this going. We'll keep the missions going.
[284:30.10]Thank you everybody for watching. I appreciate it. Thank god the game actually worked tonight.
[284:37.10]That's nothing sensitive don't worry.
[284:41.10]Have a good one.
[284:44.44]This is the Sunday stream.
[284:46.30]Not planned.
[284:47.75]But I wanted to, like, get a good five hours in because on Friday we just didn't get to do very much.
[284:53.23]So, Red Dead Redemption continues on Tuesday.
[284:56.03]I'll see you guys soon.
[284:57.47]Have a good luck.
[284:58.23]Have a good luck.
[284:58.89]Have a good fun.
[285:01.05]Let me see.
[285:01.59]I missed one bit.
[285:02.41]Thank you.
[285:03.19]Thanks to you, Funky Berlin, for the four bucks.
[285:07.67]I'm cheering all I have left so the Jerma lets me down from this horse.
[285:11.91]Oh, well, you did get off.
[285:14.31]Unfortunately, the trade didn't go through.
[285:15.77]You ended up getting an untimely subscriber end.
[285:21.34]You know what I mean?
[285:22.78]Anytime one of those people dies, that's an unsubscription.
[285:25.30]It's okay, though.
[285:30.41]Anyways, good night.
[285:31.53]See you guys Tuesday.
[285:32.61]Much love.
[286:00.68]Thank you.
[286:35.56]Thank you.
[287:10.44]you
