[00:05.44]Hey guys.
[00:05.72]How you doing?
[00:15.55]How are you?
[00:15.95]How are you?
[00:19.97]Hey, get out of here.
[00:20.70]Get out of here.
[00:21.12]Get out of here.
[00:21.70]Get out of here.
[00:22.10]Get out of here.
[00:23.48]Get out of here.
[00:29.00]That's an old one.
[00:30.50]From like last year.
[00:35.65]Our classic humor from six months ago or so.
[00:44.79]Welcome.
[00:45.09]We're going to be doing some interesting stuff today.
[00:52.59]Did you hear me clear my throat?
[00:53.49]I hope not.
[00:56.57]We're going to be watching some more infomercials.
[00:59.69]I have a bunch queued up here.
[01:02.03]We're not just going to do food this time.
[01:04.33]First one seems very, very interesting, and I'm very curious how it plays out.
[01:12.30]Stream's not going to be more than probably a few hours today.
[01:16.06]I think that after like two or three hours of doing this, it's probably it.
[01:20.02]I need to take a break from the overstimulation of infomercials.
[01:25.17]Plus, I need to make sure I get something ready for tomorrow.
[01:29.05]Not for stream, but you know, for Jeremy.
[01:32.63]So I got some stuff going on tomorrow that I have to prepare for.
[01:34.69]So we'll be live for like a few hours.
[01:40.66]We'll see.
[01:42.94]Have I seen Morbius?
[01:43.92]No, I'm never going to see Morbius.
[01:47.05]I'll probably have a dream about the movie Morbius, and that will count as me watching it.
[01:51.45]I think that... Is that fair?
[01:52.87]I think that's fair.
[01:59.11]What did you rate it?
[01:59.99]I don't know.
[02:04.98]What does everybody else say?
[02:07.32]What does it have on Metacritic right now?
[02:09.64]The exact score on Metacritic right now.
[02:11.58]The exact score.
[02:25.17]35%?
[02:25.39]I'd probably give it like a 30.
[02:26.91]I'd probably give it like somewhere in the 30s.
[02:37.40]Morbius is better than your streams.
[02:39.52]Okay.
[02:41.39]But a multi-million dollar, like a hundred million dollar Marvel Studios project that had 5,000 people work on is better than me watching infomercials?
[02:55.06]But here's the thing, are you sure?
[02:58.06]Are you sure?
[02:58.62]I don't know.
[03:04.67]We'll see.
[03:09.79]Okay, then the YouTube title has to be watching infomercials is confirmed better than the Morbius movie, right?
[03:17.28]That's only if it's confirmed today.
[03:25.32]Alright, I'm pretty much ready.
[03:30.27]Yes, it is confirmed.
[03:35.22]Alright, let's get started.
[03:35.88]We're only here for a few hours, so... Let me clear my throat one more time, because I'm fucking Throat Andy.
[03:45.00]Hope you had a good sleep, those of you that slept.
[03:48.35]What?
[03:48.47]What does that mean?
[03:51.69]I hear you.
[03:55.35]Okay, hold on.
[03:59.21]Alright, this one's called Amazing Discoveries Infomercial, The Human Calculator.
[04:03.70]Human Calculator.
[04:05.89]Apparently it's for a product that teaches you how to do math really fast or something, and I thought, okay, I'm very curious.
[04:11.91]I need to know.
[04:13.25]Let's find out.
[04:13.93]You guys ready?
[04:19.23]Did you just wake up?
[04:20.03]No.
[04:23.26]Here we go.
[04:25.28]Special program Amazing Discoveries is a paid advertisement presented in its entirety by Media Arts International.
[04:33.41]Coming up next on Amazing Discoveries, we'll show you how to turn on the human calculator in you.
[04:37.64]Alright.
[04:38.98]I need to know this.
[04:39.94]Mike Levy.
[04:42.61]Holy shit.
[04:44.11]That sweater is fucking insane.
[04:45.37]I love it.
[04:45.67]Oh, he's here.
[04:46.03]Whoa, they put him on the spot.
[04:47.29]Hold on.
[04:47.67]They put him on the spot for that.
[04:49.07]We're not going to watch all 28 minutes.
[04:50.39]Don't worry.
[04:51.09]Is this a game show?
[04:51.73]No, this is not a game show.
[05:12.49]In 30 seconds, they introduced the show, showed the guy, and gave him a gotcha question.
[05:20.76]And he got it immediately right.
[05:24.23]You guys ready?
[05:24.67]Scott, here's a hard one.
[05:26.95]4,379 divided by 7.
[05:27.29]What is that?
[05:34.17]625.57142.
[05:34.19]What?
[05:34.47]Alright.
[05:35.59]What the fuck are you talking about?
[05:40.41]What?
[05:41.33]Obviously likes math.
[05:43.19]But let's be honest with ourselves.
[05:44.41]Is there a screen?
[05:44.89]How many people in today's studio audience have been frustrated or intimidated by math?
[05:48.65]How many people here?
[05:50.26]Me?
[05:50.68]I don't know shit about math.
[05:52.00]But you know, the important thing is that if you don't pick up math young as a child, it can actually slow down or stop how far you can go in life.
[05:59.08]It can limit how much money you can make.
[06:00.96]What the fuck?
[06:01.38]When did this come out?
[06:02.08]When did this come out?
[06:21.08]1980 something.
[06:25.42]Like 83, 84.
[06:29.48]That statement, remember, if you don't know math, you're going to be fucked for the rest of your life.
[06:36.20]If you don't understand how to become a human calculator, you're going to be eating out of a dumpster tomorrow.
[06:44.81]John.
[06:46.45]our special guest says that by the end of today's show everyone in our audience and you at home are going to be able to do complex mathematical calculations not on paper and not with an old-fashioned calculator but in your head okay how is this possible Mike just keep an open mind because today I'm going to show you and everyone watching well can we do this power we have deep down inside us and we just don't know how to turn it on
[07:11.38]If this works, let's do it.
[07:12.12]Oh, this is to prove it.
[07:13.06]This is to prove it.
[07:13.74]Wait, what?
[07:14.10]Hold on a minute.
[07:38.24]He was on a show and they said, hey, if you suck at math, call in.
[07:42.20]And 22,000 people called in and said, hey, I can't do it.
[07:47.35]And they brought, they picked four of those 22,000 people.
[07:51.99]Okay, so I want to make sure I'm understanding how this played out here.
[07:57.36]Who cares?
[07:58.30]That's not a big deal.
[08:00.06]And they're from Florida, from California, and even all the way from Alabama.
[08:04.86]Welcome, everyone.
[08:05.94]Yeah, but I mean, this is not fair.
[08:07.38]This is a kid.
[08:09.00]At the end of the show, 22,000 people phoned in and admitted that they were poor in math.
[08:20.13]And we've invited four of them to join us here on today's Amazing Discoveries.
[08:23.51]And they're from a quarter of the nation.
[08:24.98]They're from Florida.
[08:26.70]from California and even all the way from Alabama.
[08:29.67]Welcome, everyone.
[08:30.59]OK, but how would you know all that math if you're like a kid?
[08:33.81]By the end of today's show, he's going to have you all doing complex math calculations in your head.
[08:39.71]I'm here, too.
[08:40.55]I would be number five.
[08:41.23]OK, Scott, go for it.
[08:42.41]Oh, no, Mike.
[08:43.19]I'm not going to do it.
[08:43.83]I've got to do this show with you.
[08:45.09]So what I did was I brought a friend with me that's going to take him backstage during the show and teach him how to do everything.
[08:49.92]OK, bring out Scott's man.
[08:51.20]What?
[08:51.46]Kevin, come on out.
[08:52.50]I need Kevin.
[08:54.34]Wait a minute.
[08:56.57]Kevin's a child!
[08:57.74]Mike, that's just it.
[09:02.40]This program is so easy, anybody can learn it.
[09:04.99]It doesn't matter how young or old you are.
[09:06.65]Are you sure you can do this?
[09:09.86]Oh, that's a lot of pressure.
[09:10.90]That's a lot of pressure, son.
[09:14.87]Everyone here want to see some more demonstrations from Scott?
[09:17.73]Yeah, let's see it.
[09:18.63]I want to see how this... I'm very curious.
[09:20.71]We've enlisted the help of Ray Gayton.
[09:22.49]Now, Ray Gayton is a certified public accountant from a nationwide accounting... They got, like, a tax attorney?
[09:27.09]And he's here to check Scott's accuracy.
[09:29.57]He's going to follow along with Scott using his adding machine here.
[09:32.39]And Scott... They... This is an expense they didn't have to have.
[09:41.31]In this image right now, this man is holding a calculator.
[09:47.41]This guy in this, this guy doesn't need to be here.
[09:50.77]He has an adding machine.
[09:52.09]What is this?
[09:53.39]What the fuck is this thing?
[09:56.19]Is that fudge brownie?
[09:57.11]What is he, what are you talking about?
[10:00.96]Why does this guy have to be here?
[10:02.94]For every correct answer, you're going to hear this sound.
[10:06.28]But Scott, should you give us a wrong answer, Ray's going to give you one of these.
[10:10.24]Okay, thanks, Ray.
[10:11.30]And to give you some really tough problems, we have an entire Girl Scout troop here in our audience.
[10:16.64]Top problems?
[10:19.43]And they're going to give you some really tough problems, Scott.
[10:22.09]Are you ready?
[10:22.99]I'm ready, Mike.
[10:23.61]But afterwards, I want to show everybody how easy it is and that anybody can learn how to do this.
[10:27.35]Did this cost money?
[10:28.65]What is your name?
[10:29.67]Patricia.
[10:30.51]Patricia let's give Scott uh a big long row of three digit numbers to add up give him four three digit numbers and Scott's gonna add him in his head go ahead 333 plus 454. that's 700 plus 699 plus 13 14. and I gotta give you one too here's 20 984. I don't know this is stupid 3 469.
[10:58.65]This is a calculator with paper.
[11:00.95]That was a calculator with paper in it.
[11:03.83]He's using the force.
[11:04.57]Hold on a minute.
[11:05.39]But wait.
[11:29.91]800.
[11:30.53]Right here.
[11:30.85]This, like, the, like, I can hear the music.
[11:36.93]53.2857142.
[11:36.95]Yeah, right.
[11:39.95]That's fucking impossible.
[11:44.48]Mike, it's so easy.
[11:45.50]If I could, could you have the girl that gave me the addition problems?
[11:47.92]I want to bring her down here and teach her how to do it.
[11:51.71]I don't want someone to get, like, powerbombed through that table.
[11:55.35]This table... This is the set table that is breakable.
[11:59.54]Let me just give you some insight here.
[12:01.10]This is made out of, like, plywood.
[12:04.54]Like, small, thin sheets of plywood.
[12:07.60]And no supports.
[12:08.92]This is made for someone to go through this table.
[12:12.98]But I imagine somebody's gonna get annoyed with this guy, and they're gonna go at it, and he's gonna get, like, fucking chokeslammed through this table.
[12:19.91]Yeah, it's like an Eric Andre table, yeah.
[12:22.85]This is the, this is the, I'm going to go through this eventually table.
[12:31.18]Okay, how do you do it?
[12:32.76]Patricia, when we normally add a column of numbers up, don't we start on the right hand side and then go to the left and carry and all that stuff?
[12:39.00]It's pretty difficult, but I want to show you a really easy way to get the answer, okay?
[12:43.29]Now, instead of starting over here, let's start on the left-hand side.
[12:46.40]And this 1 right here, doesn't it stand for 100?
[12:48.02]Yes.
[12:48.88]And what does this 2 stand for?
[12:50.10]200.
[12:50.98]Okay, so now let's keep a running total in our heads, okay?
[12:53.84]300.
[12:53.86]What's 100 plus 200?
[12:55.14]300.
[12:55.98]Plus another 100?
[12:57.28]It's 400.
[12:58.24]400.
[12:58.40]Right, plus 200 more?
[12:59.42]600.
[13:00.38]Okay, now let's go to the top of the next column, which is the 10s, right?
[13:03.95]So this 210 stands for 20, so add it to 600 and what do you get?
[13:06.89]620.
[13:06.91]Plus 20 more? 640.
[13:09.93]Plus 20 more.
[13:10.73]660.
[13:10.75]Plus 10 more.
[13:13.49]670.
[13:14.13]Okay, now look at the top of the ones.
[13:15.53]What's 670 plus 3?
[13:16.67]But this is like a lot to do in your head.
[13:20.89]Plus 6 more.
[13:21.43]679.
[13:21.87]Plus 1.
[13:22.25]680.
[13:22.67]And 4 more.
[13:23.19]684.
[13:23.61]684, and that's the right answer.
[13:26.53]Patricia!
[13:27.82]What?
[13:28.14]No fucking way!
[13:29.50]Let's hear it for Patricia.
[13:31.54]But Mike, bring me the other girl down that gave me the real hard division problem.
[13:34.76]I want to show her.
[13:35.66]The division problem.
[13:38.09]Now this one is horseshit.
[13:39.35]I'm curious, but this is horseshit.
[13:40.67]You pretty good at multiplication?
[13:41.75]Yeah.
[13:42.11]Alright, I want to show you a shortcut for real big numbers.
[13:44.52]Let's say we wanted to multiply 95 times 95, okay?
[13:48.86]Now here's how you do it.
[13:50.02]How far is 95 from 100?
[13:51.16]Five.
[13:52.44]Okay, so what you do is you put minus five underneath, and what do you get?
[13:55.59]What's 95 minus five?
[13:57.46]90.
[13:57.48]I mean... 90.
[13:58.60]You had it.
[13:59.02]You had it.
[13:59.34]It's alright.
[14:00.08]And now, take this number here and square it.
[14:02.10]What's 5 times 5?
[14:03.28]25.
[14:03.74]25.
[14:04.16]And write down here, and that's the answer to 95 times 95.
[14:06.99]9,025.
[14:07.21]Yeah, but this is... Alright, but hold on.
[14:10.75]This is not... That's not the problem he did, though.
[14:15.71]That's not the problem that she said.
[14:17.41]Wasn't it?
[14:17.83]Wasn't it like a huge amount of fucking decimal points?
[14:22.20]That means 96 times 96.
[14:23.76]Now, how do you do it?
[14:27.15]96 from 100 is 4.
[14:28.35]4?
[14:28.83]Keep watching it.
[14:29.41]Minus 4 and what do you get?
[14:31.25]92.
[14:31.39]Okay.
[14:31.97]Write that down now.
[14:32.75]What do I do?
[14:33.23]Square the 4, which is 16, and put it after 92.
[14:36.81]Great.
[14:37.15]And what's the answer to 96 times 96?
[14:38.51]9,216.
[14:38.65]That was terrific.
[14:42.73]So what?
[14:43.31]But that's not the question.
[14:44.33]Scott, these girls caught right on.
[14:46.90]Congratulations, girls.
[14:48.26]How do you do that?
[14:49.42]Mike, I see thousands of kids, parents, and teachers every week.
[14:53.04]You're learning.
[14:53.70]And I see the same results time and time again.
[14:56.09]Well, we want to see those results for ourselves.
[14:58.17]We want to see those results for ourselves.
[14:59.83]And visit a Cholla Junior High School in Phoenix, Arizona, where Scott's been teaching his methods and having some pretty amazing results.
[15:06.18]Wait, he's a teacher there?
[15:07.22]Alright, Nicole, we have your math book.
[15:08.74]And notice how I have to use a calculator for this.
[15:11.30]You ready?
[15:11.80]What's 462 plus 385 plus 517?
[15:13.13]What is that?
[15:21.11]1,364.
[15:21.17]That's correct.
[15:22.25]That's really good.
[15:23.53]That was pretty easy, thanks.
[15:24.47]That was easy?
[15:25.01]What do you mean easy?
[15:25.59]Alright, Kyle, what's 24 times 97?
[15:26.48]2,328.
[15:26.50]That's right.
[15:26.82]It takes me longer to put in the calculator.
[15:28.24]Alright, Carly, your problem is 93 squared. 8,649.
[15:45.18]I'm not through pushing.
[15:46.58]You're right.
[15:48.36]I want these shirts.
[15:50.40]What is the cube root?
[15:52.85]And I didn't even know what a cube root was, let alone do the stuff in your head.
[15:56.99]Did they get this guy in a time machine?
[16:01.69]This is this person.
[16:04.87]Now let's see if it works on me from fucking 40 years ago.
[16:08.54]It's the same person.
[16:09.32]What's that, Zach?
[16:13.66]58 the same voice Well those kids the same person talking so we visited a woman who's devoted her life to math to discover Why Scott's methods are so successful?
[16:26.74]Dr. Mary Hatfield, you're an assistant professor here at Arizona State University, and you've been a director of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, representing literally thousands of mathematicians around the country.
[16:36.25]Okay, the camera's going to pan, and he's talking to the lady over here.
[16:37.97]You're in charge of teaching teachers what to teach and how to teach.
[16:40.97]Now, I understand that Scott's methods are really very different than the traditional way of teaching mathematics, right?
[16:45.98]Yes, they are.
[16:47.10]The traditional way is boring.
[16:49.70]It's a rough memorization.
[16:51.09]It's true.
[16:51.45]Math sucks.
[16:51.87]I fucking hate it.
[16:52.91]It's so stupid.
[16:53.73]Just the way the teacher tells you to do it.
[16:56.11]And Scott's way is to take those numbers and say, hey, put these numbers apart.
[17:00.11]If it works, it works.
[17:01.08]Put them back together.
[17:02.28]Try this.
[17:03.00]Double this.
[17:03.62]Square that.
[17:04.42]And all of those things.
[17:06.18]Alright, let's go.
[17:06.90]Diana here to our studios in Los Angeles.
[17:08.96]And we're going to give Carla another tough problem.
[17:11.24]You ready?
[17:12.21]You ready, Carla?
[17:13.55]Okay, but just to show everyone that you have no calculators there, show them your hands.
[17:17.45]They're not a magician.
[17:18.71]She's not a magician.
[17:19.89]Here's a tough one.
[17:20.69]I'm going to give you 73 squared.
[17:23.00]Now, 73 squared is 73 times 73.
[17:25.28]You don't have anything up your sleeves?
[17:27.68]Like a fucking deck of cards?
[17:29.72]Wow.
[17:31.42]You did it just as fast.
[17:36.44]Alright, where does this end up?
[17:37.62]Wait, we got, hold on, we have an expert.
[17:39.40]I hated math, I hated it through high school, I hated it in college, and I was so thankful.
[17:43.59]So I fucking sued it.
[17:45.57]I sued it, lost $40 million.
[17:48.19]And I use math every single day.
[17:51.30]Okay, how does this end?
[17:54.38]By doing even the most difficult math problems in your head, often faster than a calculator.
[17:58.66]1,858.
[17:58.72]This has been a series of people saying large numbers.
[18:03.41]Stop skipping.
[18:05.53]I feel like we've seen the whole thing already.
[18:10.83]I would lay it down and I would go to sleep.
[18:13.09]You'd go to sleep?
[18:13.79]You must have really hated math.
[18:14.87]Yes, I hated it, Mike.
[18:15.89]And Scott, I understand, showed you a new way to think about math, right?
[18:18.85]Yeah.
[18:18.99]What happened?
[18:19.73]He taught us that it was easier for us to do it in our head than it was to do it on paper or the way they taught us.
[18:27.19]Oh wait, hold on a minute.
[18:30.33]If you need to show your work, you can't do that, right?
[18:35.45]You'd have to put it on... I want someone to go through that table.
[18:38.07]Ready?
[18:38.27]Yeah.
[18:52.97]Huh?
[18:54.73]What?
[18:55.65]What happened?
[18:56.13]What happened?
[18:56.53]Alright, human calculator.
[18:57.47]That was a pretty good one.
[18:58.67]That was a pretty good one.
[19:00.23]Let's keep going.
[19:01.01]I got a lot, by the way.
[19:02.35]This one is also not food related.
[19:03.81]This one is... The Martinettis bring home a computer.
[19:27.08]The following is a paid advertisement by Apple Computer Inc.
[19:30.98]This is a dramatization all characters are- Why would you say that?
[19:34.76]As far as I can tell, families have two kinds of people.
[19:38.10]The ones who want everything to stay the same, and the ones who want to spice things up a bit.
[19:43.16]I guess you can count me in the second group.
[19:45.00]Why are you standing like that?
[19:46.96]I feel like I stand like that in pictures.
[19:48.87]Frank, he's always up for something crazy.
[19:51.67]And Mom, she's a classic.
[19:54.37]gramps loves opera so you can count him in I did all this on my computer and schubert he's just cool schubert I guess in our family it was only pop who was really set in his ways wait of course we all thought this was really I guess and schubert he's just cool oh is it I guess in our family it was only pop hold on oh it's a dog it's like is this guy's name schubert
[20:21.10]That's interesting.
[20:22.08]Why are you calling dad by his first name?
[20:27.93]That would be weird, right?
[20:29.77]Like, oh, of course, my dad, but I call him by his first name.
[20:34.49]He's just cool.
[20:36.41]I guess in our family, it was only Pop who was really set in his ways.
[20:40.05]Okay, dad doesn't like computers.
[20:41.59]We all thought that that would change once we got our new computer.
[20:47.30]I'm tj and this is the story about when my family the martinettis brought home a computer okay so who grandpa is getting a computer in our family was a real adventure we're all so different I never thought we could agree on one mom you see she runs a home business that is when she's not running the home did she say hey get off like get off the computer
[21:14.31]Is that what she says?
[21:15.35]She runs a home business.
[21:17.51]I get off of him.
[21:18.77]That is when she's not running the home.
[21:20.49]Oh, she's kiddo.
[21:22.33]Frank, he's the brains around here.
[21:24.81]Studying to be an engineer or something like that.
[21:33.94]Zoe and Gramps.
[21:34.82]They're the Martinetti Philharmonic and Jug Band.
[21:37.93]Allegro, honey.
[21:39.15]More Allegro.
[21:40.49]Oh, there's a kindly old man.
[21:44.21]As for Pop, he's got his own ideas about things.
[21:47.73]Where's his sports?
[21:49.07]But he's a great guy.
[21:50.02]Hey, Pop.
[21:52.22]Check this.
[21:55.44]That's pretty clever, DJ.
[21:56.82]Yeah, Pop's understanding, supportive.
[21:59.32]But no points.
[22:00.54]Don't delete that.
[22:01.28]Delete that.
[22:01.76]You fucking put that on Facebook either.
[22:03.70]Making our family look fucking stupid.
[22:05.90]Making me look like an idiot.
[22:06.86]Don't put that on Facebook.
[22:07.92]How many likes does it have?
[22:11.98]40?
[22:12.00]Alright, if it gets to 50, it won't be upset.
[22:14.29]And sometimes as stubborn as a mule.
[22:16.45]No points?
[22:18.23]What do you mean, no points?
[22:20.49]It's a work of art here.
[22:21.73]A work of art?
[22:22.87]Yeah, that's what everybody thought.
[22:24.31]Oh, I like it.
[22:27.05]No points.
[22:28.17]Except Pop.
[22:29.44]Why is he saying no point?
[22:33.42]And I gotta tell you how we weren't gonna keep the computer until we earned enough points to convince Pop we should.
[22:39.44]The world got along fine for thousands of years without computers.
[22:44.18]The world got along terrible.
[22:45.92]And that's because there was no Tetris.
[22:48.66]You hear that?
[22:49.36]Exactly.
[22:51.62]See what I mean?
[22:53.08]I better go back to the beginning, though.
[22:54.58]Okay, but... Because it's a wild story.
[22:56.96]And you really gotta know our family best.
[22:58.60]Oh, this game's awesome.
[22:59.49]This game's amazing.
[23:00.17]I guess it all started the night I came home late from school.
[23:05.83]Sorry I'm late, you guys.
[23:07.07]I was finishing up my report at the computer lab school.
[23:10.41]Oh.
[23:10.93]Well, since when's our typewriter not good enough for reports?
[23:13.27]Our typewriter.
[23:14.47]He can do all kinds of stuff on the computer he can't do here.
[23:17.93]Like?
[23:19.49]I use the electronic encyclopedia.
[23:21.63]The internet.
[23:22.95]I put pictures and words together.
[23:24.79]The thing is, Pop had a computer.
[23:26.33]He's not even paying attention to his son.
[23:27.77]All he ever did was put numbers into it.
[23:30.08]I don't blame him for not wanting one of those.
[23:32.04]He's daydreaming?
[23:33.22]Hold on.
[23:33.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:34.98]I use the electronic encyclopedia.
[23:37.02]The internet.
[23:38.34]I put pictures and words together.
[23:40.18]The thing is, Pop had a computer.
[23:42.49]He's just not even listening.
[23:44.88]And about all he ever did was put numbers into it.
[23:47.62]I don't blame him for not wanting one of those.
[23:49.85]But he didn't know there was a whole other world out there.
[23:52.53]Hard disk drive, it's really cool.
[23:54.91]I hear you can even get music on the computer.
[23:57.71]Opera?
[23:58.57]Sure, Gramps, and pictures too.
[24:00.79]What, you can do that on a computer?
[24:02.42]Mm-hmm.
[24:04.10]Oh, hey.
[24:04.60]The kids could really use... Nothing has changed, by the way.
[24:08.88]Nothing.
[24:10.06]Zero.
[24:12.52]This was like 20 or 30 years ago.
[24:15.95]the exact same conversation happens.
[24:20.23]That like, wait, what do you mean a computer?
[24:21.71]What's a computer?
[24:22.82]I mean, 30 years have gone by.
[24:25.24]Is this always going to be like this?
[24:27.96]Like, when I get to be like 80, am I going to look at grandkids and stuff and be like, wait a minute, what is a computer?
[24:36.42]You could do that on a computer?
[24:37.72]What's a computer do?
[24:38.78]Is the old people always just don't know, don't understand?
[24:42.19]I feel like, is that what's going to happen?
[24:46.53]Like, even though I've been using computers, like, my adult life, right?
[24:49.55]Am I just not gonna know?
[24:51.63]Use a computer, Lou.
[24:52.99]Maybe even you and me.
[24:54.99]I don't know, Mare.
[24:55.64]What if we get one and we don't use it?
[24:57.14]Well, we could just look.
[24:59.28]I want one.
[25:00.56]Me too.
[25:01.94]No promises.
[25:03.56]So that's how the great computer quest began.
[25:05.68]Grandpa's demanding.
[25:06.92]Of course, Pop said that before we did anything, we had to talk to an expert.
[25:10.66]Well, who do we know that knows a lot about this kind of stuff?
[25:14.94]Fletcher.
[25:16.69]Oh, is it gonna be like a hacker?
[25:18.15]Next day, we went to see Fletcher.
[25:20.25]Fletcher was what Pop would call a piece of work.
[25:23.40]He was Frank's friend.
[25:24.72]A real genius.
[25:25.78]Look at this store.
[25:26.70]There he is.
[25:30.71]Whoa, the whole Martinetti family.
[25:32.51]Wow.
[25:32.73]Look at these monitors.
[25:33.77]Fletcher, we're thinking about buying a computer.
[25:36.07]Tell Pop it's a good idea.
[25:38.27]It's a good idea now I could sell you something expensive Mr.. M, but I won't Thanks Fletcher.
[25:45.44]Now.
[25:45.54]What are you expensive?
[25:47.38]Well, let's see.
[25:48.48]It's EB games in a computer.
[25:50.14]The whole family could use right right?
[25:52.26]Yeah something with multimedia Yeah, we have a lot of PC clones in stock PC clone.
[25:59.23]He seen us on sale Of course you add a few options windows
[26:06.89]What the fuck?
[26:07.47]No, get that out of here.
[26:08.51]What the fuck?
[26:09.27]You need all this shit.
[26:10.05]You need all this.
[26:10.63]You need a graphics card and you need a sound card.
[26:13.93]You need a monitor and everything.
[26:18.53]And look at how much that is.
[26:33.94]And let's come over to the Apple computer, which is twice as expensive as what I just showed you.
[26:39.34]It's making a point.
[26:41.06]Also, you have to configure this one to run multimedia.
[26:44.47]Mr. M, now all of this is yours for mere... Uh-oh.
[26:49.81]Pop was not impressed.
[26:52.65]But then... On the other hand, you could buy a Macintosh Performer.
[26:58.14]Yeah.
[26:59.20]Fletcher showed us the Performa.
[27:01.02]It was like the Macintoshes we had at school.
[27:03.40]Except it came with a whole bunch of extras.
[27:06.64]It had CD-ROMs that Zoe and I could use for learning.
[27:10.32]There are programs Mom could use for home business.
[27:13.38]Whoa, look at all these financial charts.
[27:15.48]To get information online.
[27:17.80]Plus, there were games.
[27:21.58]Is Grandpa the gamer?
[27:22.52]Plus,
[27:27.56]Grandpa's the gamer.
[27:30.36]There were games.
[27:32.78]This was a lot easier than a PC with Windows, and Fletcher showed us why.
[27:37.50]On the Windows PC, he had to know pathways and commands to manage files.
[27:42.15]No, you didn't.
[27:42.71]With the Performa, you just clicked on a file and there you were.
[27:45.77]Was this the DOS kind of heyday?
[27:47.05]On the Windows PC, running a CD-ROM was a real hassle.
[27:51.04]I guess this was with, yeah, DOS, you're right.
[27:57.31]Oh, show me about birds of prey.
[28:02.93]Alright, everybody thinks... Alright, some of you guys might think that, like, oh, that's kind of a random thing.
[28:08.96]I have sat there on YouTube and just kind of had my chin down like this with, like, my iPad here.
[28:16.36]And I probably have typed in to just, like, what was Harry Truman's life like?
[28:24.58]Show me an eagle in a nest.
[28:27.32]I feel like I do that all the time.
[28:29.64]I just look up random shit.
[28:32.58]We all thought for sure Papa's gonna buy the Performa.
[28:36.03]And the price?
[28:40.77]How much?
[28:42.35]How much was it?
[28:43.17]Oh, no, they're arguing in the store.
[28:45.81]And the printer?
[29:08.57]If the family proves that they really need it, then you got to pay me back.
[29:12.92]Oh, Dad.
[29:13.92]So that's how it started.
[29:15.44]A little friendly wager.
[29:16.58]What do you say?
[29:17.36]Gramps was going to buy it and bet Pop that we could change his mind about computers.
[29:21.78]Come on.
[29:22.24]I'm on?
[29:22.94]OK.
[29:23.92]And that's when Pop thought of points.
[29:26.02]OK, kids, everybody.
[29:28.33]Points?
[29:28.59]We get 100 points in one month, and I'll pay for the computer.
[29:31.53]How do we get points?
[29:33.87]I'll figure it out.
[29:35.10]You.
[29:36.24]All I knew was that we were fined for bringing a computer home.
[29:39.14]Scammed by Grandpa.
[29:40.14]And the next month was going to be very interesting.
[29:44.08]Grandpa just goes in and grabs him like right here.
[29:46.84]And they go to the back and into the computers.
[29:49.33]Multimedia.
[29:49.57]Yes.
[30:10.99]Simple as plugging in a VCR or a camcorder.
[30:14.81]Wow.
[30:15.15]That's actually a pretty big deal.
[30:15.91]You can capture and edit your own video production.
[30:18.51]That's a pretty big deal.
[30:19.89]Right on your computer.
[30:21.32]And with an Apple Color printer, you can even put your video pictures into family newsletters or greeting cards.
[30:27.36]Alright, here, I don't... You guys have to understand, though, we are so spoiled by how the world is right now with, like, information technology, right?
[30:36.75]But the act of printing a picture, like a color picture, was like insanity.
[30:46.78]It had never been able to happen before.
[30:50.38]So, I mean, it might seem stupid now to be like, and by the way, there's a color printer.
[30:56.00]It's like, what?
[30:56.76]Oh my goodness.
[30:58.06]How?
[31:00.00]Like an inkjet?
[31:01.82]No way.
[31:02.95]That was like going from black and white to color.
[31:04.75]It's a performer.
[31:06.17]You see, many computers with Windows have to be reconfigured or restarted over and over again to run many CD-ROMs.
[31:14.68]But with a Macintosh, a simple click is all it takes.
[31:20.90]This Performa also includes a fantastic new technology that fills your screen with full-size, full-motion TV-quality images.
[31:29.73]Images that set a whole new standard for visual quality.
[31:33.89]If you want true multimedia,
[31:36.14]Get the computer that does it best and makes it easy.
[31:40.28]A power PC driven Macintosh Performa.
[31:43.86]Quality.
[31:44.62]Apple has a full line of Performa computers.
[31:47.65]And to find the one that's right for you, just call this number now.
[31:51.97]Apple will send you a free information kit that includes all you need to know.
[31:55.79]Okay, I thought something just popped up on my screen.

[32:10.11]1 gigabyte hard drive.

[32:33.68]As your needs grow, it will too.
[32:36.85]There are other Performa models to choose as well, and each comes with over $1,300 worth of... 1995, roll your multimedia encyclopedia.
[32:45.78]Encyclopedia CDs were huge back there.

[32:53.84]But the time to act is right now.

[32:58.55]Alright, so how did the how did the family turn out?
[33:01.99]Do we get to see the end of that?
[33:03.17]Or is that a cliffhanger?
[33:03.87]Is there a part three?
[33:18.00]I have part two here.
[33:18.90]Where's part three?
[33:20.37]Oh, there we go.
[33:20.81]There's part three.
[33:21.63]There's a part... There's so many parts.
[33:23.73]Drop in the title and copy it to the VCR.
[33:27.07]There's so many parts.
[33:31.67]Great work.
[33:33.79]Who did you hire to put this together?
[33:36.61]I did it in-house.
[33:37.99]It's six parts.
[33:38.59]We're just going to skip to the family bits.
[33:41.69]Here we go.
[33:42.83]They got it.
[33:43.31]The computer home was a pretty big deal in our family.
[33:45.87]And we couldn't wait to set it up.
[33:49.01]There it is!
[33:50.51]Yep.
[34:02.56]Ooh, it's only three plugs, that's it.
[34:04.12]Easy.
[34:04.32]What about the cable management?
[34:05.44]Yeah, the cable management's fucking dog shit here.
[34:09.54]Look at that.
[34:25.16]Even the dog likes it.
[34:28.98]What do I do now?
[34:29.44]Imagine being presented.
[34:30.34]Being presented with this for the first time.
[34:49.54]Okay, back in, like, the 1800s, if you were to film, like, a train coming towards the camera, the people in the audience would run out of the theater, thinking the train was going to hit them.
[35:01.53]That, this is a very, very, this is a very collected response to this kind of, you know, technology.
[35:08.05]This is the first time you've seen this?
[35:09.21]Alright, what do I do now?
[35:11.59]Like, that's very collected?
[35:13.95]I would be freaking out.
[35:15.05]Click here, Mom.
[35:16.33]And right from the start, everybody could.
[35:19.76]Wait, is that like diagnosing?
[35:20.58]Wait, hold on.
[35:21.20]Huh?
[35:21.94]Wait.
[35:22.22]The Family Doctor 3rd Edition.
[35:49.99]This is like WebMD.
[35:54.81]So you could go and type.
[35:56.11]That was so cool.
[35:57.55]You could believe you're anywhere on the planet.
[36:01.57]This is so interesting.
[36:02.61]It really didn't take long to get the hang of things.
[36:05.28]And mom proved it.
[36:06.72]She put together the first ever Martinetti family newsletter.
[36:10.76]She took pictures we had from extra extra made those part of it, too.
[36:14.78]And when she printed it out.
[36:17.25]I could almost sense a new career in the making.
[36:19.35]Mom, media mold.
[36:21.51]How you doing that?
[36:22.99]Somebody did somebody say the Martinetti cinematic universe?
[36:26.83]Alright.
[36:27.47]Now, remember our deal.
[36:30.01]Earn 100 points and I pay for the computer.
[36:32.95]Dad, the thing's fucking phenomenal.
[36:35.15]It's a remarkable, new, ridiculous piece of technology.
[36:38.21]You're lost.
[36:38.67]I mean, come on.
[36:40.13]Just pay grandpa.
[36:41.75]It's like, really?
[36:42.97]Otherwise, how do we get points?
[36:46.15]Well, here's what I've worked out.
[36:47.89]You do your homework on the computer, you get a point.
[36:50.41]You raise your grade, you get two points.
[36:52.69]No, no, no, no.
[36:54.31]Come on.
[36:55.05]That's worth at least ten.
[36:56.44]Yeah, Grandpa, come on.
[36:57.58]I have to hand it to Pop.
[36:59.08]Five points.
[37:00.28]He never makes a decision lightly.
[37:01.74]If I use it for business?
[37:03.16]If you told him this computer could take him to the moon, he'd want to go three times.
[37:07.06]Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:07.80]You know, the reason why Grandpa's not into this is because this kid's got, like, fucking D's.
[37:15.43]And he now has to rely on this kid to make it so he doesn't have to pay like $2,500 for a computer.
[37:22.45]So it's like, hold on now.
[37:24.39]Let's not tie it to grades.
[37:26.67]Let's tie it to times that they do the dishes.
[37:29.88]Is that better?
[37:30.56]That sounds better.
[37:31.42]That's a good idea.
[37:32.58]If you told him this computer could take him to the moon, he'd want to go three times to make sure.
[37:37.64]It's just an important purchase, Mayor.
[37:39.40]I want to make sure everybody uses it.
[37:42.06]What did I tell you?
[37:43.48]The funny thing was, the computer fit into our family just like it belonged.
[37:47.02]$2,590.
[37:47.72]I mean, it really helped us all in different ways.
[37:50.28]What is that now?
[37:52.00]Mom found she could do her whole greeting card business with it.
[37:54.81]$10,000?
[37:57.75]She could design new cards and make changes just like that.
[38:03.09]Like 5K?
[38:05.08]6K?
[38:06.78]And to send a copy to her publisher, she just faxed it right from the Performa.
[38:18.11]We played this game.
[38:19.23]We actually played that exact game.
[38:21.97]That's Dinosaur Adventure.
[38:23.03]Arthur's teacher trouble.
[38:37.11]Everyone in Arthur's class studied harder than ever.
[38:43.05]And that taught her things about the world.
[38:45.77]Bro, what the fuck happened?
[38:49.99]We went from this to, like, Elsa beats Spider-Man up with a baseball bat.
[38:57.78]What the fuck happened?
[39:05.15]said there were thousands of cd-roms out there I believed it and zoe would have had them all if she could for me I like that our computers are mac algorithms because that's what our school has and the macs at school have tons of stuff I use only now instead of staying late I could bring my work home
[39:29.18]Boppy disk?
[39:30.92]Those are so cool.
[39:31.88]I like the sound those made.
[39:36.18]When you punched that in the machine, it did this like... It was awesome.
[39:45.74]I think it was Gramps, though, who did the most amazing things.
[39:51.43]He figured out all kinds of stuff to do at the computer.
[39:59.71]great sub sound he discovered e-world the online service from apple e-world have never seen an online service but before you knew it he was meeting people from all over
[40:11.28]grandpa's meeting people I think it did a lot of good more good than he ever dreamed you know Frank there's other people out there just like me no really people like the same things there's other towns there's other cities so who's rose whatever you mind we kept burning points
[40:33.08]Grandpa's on Reddit.
[40:33.58]They're so close.
[40:42.05]Of course, Zoe thought she deserved points for beating Pop games.
[40:45.61]No points for games.
[40:46.99]And Gramps agreed.
[40:47.81]Hey, why not?
[40:49.43]You learn things from games.
[40:52.11]Exactly.
[40:52.81]Frank and I thought so.
[40:54.29]But Pop didn't exactly see it our way.
[40:56.91]Somebody's not learning enough.
[40:59.07]TJ, we'll get points if you bring your math grade up.
[41:02.24]I know, I'm working on it.
[41:04.24]The proof's in the pudding.
[41:05.22]That's my grandpa was so old, didn't want to do that.
[41:07.42]The proof is in the pudding.
[41:12.55]I like it.
[41:12.97]Okay, everybody.
[41:14.49]Family picture.
[41:16.77]Perfect.
[41:18.29]Oh, this is where the... Full circle.
[41:20.17]Here we are.
[41:20.97]A cat?
[41:21.13]Was he eating out of the dog bowl?
[41:22.07]Even...
[41:48.07]To Rose.
[41:52.99]I've heard several of her performances and think she's simply the best.
[41:56.21]Tomorrow I'll send you a list of some of her best performances.
[41:59.60]Regards, Carmine.
[42:05.12]What's this?
[42:05.72]Never mind.
[42:07.63]I'll be off here in a minute, so you can do your math.
[42:11.97]Grandpa, what are all those tabs?
[42:14.51]No, those are nothing.
[42:15.29]Those are absolutely nothing.
[42:16.89]Nothing.
[42:17.51]And you know what?
[42:20.07]I still didn't know the half of it.
[42:22.27]Like, who's Rose?
[42:26.58]Who's Rose?
[42:28.22]One of the best gifts you can give to any child is a love of learning.
[42:33.16]And there's no better way to do that
[42:35.06]than with a Macintosh computer and a world of learning programs.
[42:39.54]Hi, folks.
[42:40.50]I'm Evil Uncle Greg Martinelli.
[42:46.85]I'm going to come in and fuck the whole thing up later in the show.
[42:56.54]Skip.
[42:56.96]Stop skipping.
[42:57.78]We've seen this already.
[43:03.20]I thought he was plugging the lawnmower into the computer.
[43:20.54]Like, dude, that's not, you got that, you got wrong info, man.
[43:23.92]Fixing.
[43:25.06]Ties.
[43:26.03]Checks.
[43:26.97]Paints.
[43:27.91]Faxes.
[43:28.61]This is my encyclopedia.
[43:29.93]Our taxes.
[43:30.99]Astronauts.
[43:31.57]Dinosaurs.
[43:32.99]Socks.
[43:33.59]It's always dinosaurs.
[43:34.77]Have you noticed that?
[43:35.93]This is our Mac.
[43:36.99]It's easy.
[43:39.06]You guys know that all old multimedia, all old software apparently has to be dinosaur related?
[43:47.73]It just has to be related to a dinosaur.
[43:50.77]In the days that followed, we all worked on the new computer.
[43:54.88]Mom did business.
[43:56.70]Zoe learned all about animals and music.
[44:00.70]I practiced my equations.
[44:02.18]And nobody played with the dog.
[44:03.68]Gramps, he made friends all over cyberspace.
[44:07.89]Frank went back to college.
[44:10.41]But he kept in touch with email from the Mac in his dorm.
[44:13.95]Using the computer just became second nature at our house.
[44:18.18]send money.
[44:19.86]What?
[44:22.80]So, this is really helping?
[44:24.22]Oh yeah.
[44:24.66]I mean, you can do your business better now?
[44:26.57]Absolutely.
[44:27.13]Come here, I'll show you what I'm working on.
[44:28.27]Do you like this one?
[44:32.77]Very nice.
[44:34.03]Good.
[44:34.73]I'm faxing a draft to the publisher.
[44:36.16]How?
[44:39.74]The computer had programs that could help mom do everything.
[44:43.50]She could keep track of work schedules, addresses, and projects.
[44:46.44]It's a cyber scam?
[44:47.59]Alright here.
[44:48.29]These are your orders?
[44:51.21]Uh-huh.
[44:52.25]Not bad.
[44:55.81]Zoe, now there's another story.
[44:58.35]What she did on the computer was awesome.
[45:01.47]She had a video that we shot at the zoo, and she took scenes from it to make her own picture book.
[45:09.10]That's cool.
[45:12.75]We went to the zoo, TJ and me.
[45:17.53]You wouldn't believe all the animals we'd see.
[45:21.15]Do you like it, Pop?
[45:22.99]Dad's going to get addicted to the league.
[45:24.43]I think it's going to be a bestseller.
[45:28.95]Uh-oh, here comes Tamino.
[45:31.47]He's the hero.
[45:32.63]He's the guy that gets the magic flute.
[45:34.99]Now Gramps, he loves to talk opera.
[45:38.28]With the CD-ROMs he had, he could talk it with us, and we could learn.
[45:43.60]What happens after that?
[45:44.72]Gramps took to the computer like an old hand.
[45:47.97]Wait, is this a choose-your-own-adventure book?
[45:50.45]I had a feeling there was something different about him now.
[45:53.43]Like he had a secret he wasn't ready to share.
[45:55.63]As for me, I worked on my favorite subject.
[46:03.94]Well, math wasn't so bad.
[46:06.34]If you could go at your own pace.
[46:07.74]Yeah, what was the anti-feminism thing?
[46:10.54]What?
[46:11.88]Was that what that said?
[46:12.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:17.69]What's happening?
[46:22.29]And with the computer, I could.
[46:27.25]I think you've got it.
[46:28.85]It was about this time that Pop got it, too.
[46:32.38]I mean, liking the computer.
[46:34.76]I remember one night.
[46:36.52]I was awake late.
[46:37.34]Oh, he's gonna catch Dad.
[46:40.42]There was Pop.
[46:41.74]I couldn't believe it.
[46:43.16]He was calling up eWorld to get quotes on stocks, and he found news articles he wanted, too.
[46:49.11]That's what he told me.
[46:49.93]Why would the cat lie to me?
[46:51.37]Yeah, investments.
[46:52.91]And MS-DOS.
[46:53.25]It's Docs.
[46:53.55]Are those milk and cookies?
[46:55.01]Is Dad Santa?
[46:55.31]Wait, I don't... And then came the day of reckoning.
[47:17.75]Email from Frank.
[47:19.52]He's coming home this weekend.
[47:21.58]I got a new order today.
[47:23.16]A Happy Mother's Day card.
[47:25.28]Yay!
[47:26.50]That's a point for us.
[47:27.76]Yes.
[47:28.04]Oh, that's another point.
[47:31.82]You guys will never believe this.
[47:33.69]Guess what?
[47:34.41]What?
[47:36.41]I got a B+.
[47:37.43]TJ, a B+.
[47:38.45]He did it.
[47:39.71]Oh, terrific, pal.
[47:41.27]You did great.
[47:42.39]You know what?
[47:44.45]We, uh...
[47:46.02]What?
[47:46.16]Even dad is there doing it.
[47:47.27]And now dad added points to the computer and now he has to pay for it.
[48:17.28]What's happening?
[48:19.20]We're keeping the computer.
[48:21.52]No, I'm in the wrong house.
[48:22.74]I love this grandpa.
[48:23.32]You were never gonna let the computer go, were you?
[48:26.76]But... Are we realizing right now that grandpa's the only one that can hear the music?
[48:32.77]What's happening?
[48:33.65]We're keeping the computer.
[48:36.99]No, I'm in the wrong house.
[48:38.45]You were never gonna let the computer go, were you?
[48:43.22]I just wanted to make sure everybody would use it.
[48:46.91]they all hear it you know I guess I better write that check huh who is it it's grandma carmine in grandpa oh no it's oh it's rose you must be rose and you must be carmine am I late oh no no no no you're right on time right on time hey everybody this is rose well hey welcome

[49:18.15]Right over here on the Opera Lovers Forum.
[49:20.07]The Opera Lovers Forum!
[49:23.15]So that's what Gramps had been doing all this time.
[49:25.97]So this is your Performa?
[49:27.67]Yep, that's it.
[49:29.78]Oh, it's a real piece of shit, Carmine.
[49:34.80]I knew you were a power user.
[49:36.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:38.16]You know what?
[49:39.56]I read all the magazines.
[49:41.08]I do too.
[49:42.97]Can it run Crysis?
[49:44.87]Mine can.
[49:46.65]Everything changes.
[49:49.94]There's more.
[49:50.40]I'd like to propose a toast to our honored guest, Rose.
[49:55.50]You are always welcome in our home.
[49:58.04]Salute.
[50:00.21]Salute, Dad.
[50:01.59]Salute, Rose.
[50:04.25]So that's our story, one month in the life of the Martinettis.
[50:08.65]I wouldn't say that everything that happened was on account of our computer, but I wouldn't say it wasn't either.
[50:14.95]I mean, we didn't only get a computer.
[50:17.83]It got us.
[50:18.59]Power user.
[50:19.39]And sometimes, I think it even knows what it got itself into.
[50:23.70]Well, after all, it is a Macintosh.
[50:28.96]Here comes the guy.
[50:29.70]Here he is.
[50:30.42]What do you think about that?
[50:32.52]How did that make you feel?
[50:33.52]If you were to write down your thoughts on that last commercial, what would you write?
[50:39.01]Forma is the way it helps you keep in touch with the world.
[50:42.80]From cruising the internet to sending email, a performer can take you everywhere you want to go.
[50:47.88]Anymore?
[50:50.12]This is a tremendous offering.
[50:51.96]Family room.
[50:53.74]The marketing department.
[50:54.96]This is the conference room.
[50:57.45]These are not the Martinettis.
[51:02.29]We almost missed the fucking dog post-credits scene.
[51:18.29]Is he pissed on the computer?
[51:22.99]Okay.
[51:24.93]That's it.
[51:33.67]That was a blog?
[51:34.49]Okay, that was the Martinetti's take home a computer.
[51:45.44]Alright, we got some more food ones, but, alright, should I do some more food ones?
[51:50.75]Yeah, absolutely.
[51:51.99]How about the grill disk?
[51:53.47]That's what I'm, yeah, grill disk.
[51:57.23]real outdoor barbecue flavor but when you don't have the space you miss out on the taste not anymore hi I'm Joe fowler and this is the non-stick grill disk that turns virtually any pan into an indoor grill you place heat and eat you'll hear the sear and see the grill marks locking in that delicious outdoor flavor so okay let me just be let me ask a question very everybody here
[52:23.87]This doesn't do anything, right?
[52:27.84]This is just a way to make an aesthetically pleasing image on your food.
[52:35.77]This doesn't do anything different.
[52:36.85]You're still cooking.
[52:37.87]It's not anything different, right?
[52:41.29]No.
[52:41.59]Am I wrong?
[52:42.33]Does it actually do anything different?
[52:45.33]Isn't it just like... What if you just cook it... What if you cook it... What?
[52:49.25]Does it do anything?
[52:49.97]What?
[53:10.70]It kind of does slide around.
[53:13.98]And now when it rains or snows, you've got the grill that will never close.
[53:17.92]And I want you to see this.
[53:19.27]Because the disk is raised, it creates a flavor channel for your favorite marinade.
[53:24.09]Just add the lid and seal the flavors right in.
[53:28.12]That's cool.
[53:28.90]Wow.
[53:29.08]Watch out for that hot pan.
[53:30.56]Watch out for that hot pan.
[53:31.52]That's too close.
[53:50.16]That's a hot pan, man.
[53:51.36]Don't just bring it over to the table.
[53:52.52]Alright, I mean, this... Alright, the grill disk.
[53:55.43]Alright, whatever.
[53:56.89]Alright, fine.
[53:57.77]The grill disk is not... Whatever.
[53:59.65]That's fine.
[54:00.29]What about the flavor stone?
[54:01.73]Pound cake?
[54:02.45]Yeah, what?
[54:02.71]Yeah, that's weird.
[54:20.33]a pound cake on the grill?
[54:23.98]I was just not even paying attention.
[54:25.28]I honestly just, I blanked on that one.
[54:31.02]Yeah, that was a grilling a pound cake.
[54:32.68]That's kind of fucking weird.
[54:35.04]Alright, okay, alright, alright, alright.

[57:58.06]I can't even hear it.
[58:00.06]Uh, let me try and explain it this way.
[58:02.28]If you're going to slice or chop an onion, you probably use one of these, right?
[58:05.30]Sure.
[58:05.62]A knife.
[58:06.24]Right.
[58:06.44]A single blade.
[58:07.10]Yeah.
[58:07.38]No matter how quick you chop or slice, it's still only one stroke at a time.
[58:11.74]Yes.
[58:12.04]You with me up to now?
[58:12.82]Up to now.
[58:13.30]Simple.
[58:13.74]Okay.
[58:14.26]Now, what do you see?
[58:15.76]Two blades.
[58:16.34]Two blades.
[58:16.90]Okay.
[58:17.42]Twice as fast.
[58:18.40]Oh, Nancy, hold that thought.
[58:20.24]Alright.
[58:20.84]I think there's got to be another version of this, right?
[58:22.42]24 minutes?
[58:25.27]25 minutes?
[58:28.50]Is this the same one?
[58:29.08]This is the same one.
[58:30.34]I think this, yeah.
[58:31.16]No, I think this is the same one.
[58:34.22]22 minutes?
[58:34.46]Shit, it's all fucked up.
[58:39.78]There's no, it doesn't exist.
[58:42.98]I can't turn it up.
[58:43.75]It's as loud as it goes.
[58:46.41]Let me try and explain it this way.
[58:47.91]If you're gonna slice or chop an onion...
[58:49.72]You probably use one of these, right?
[58:50.92]Sure.
[58:51.24]A knife.
[58:51.50]Right.
[58:52.06]A single blade.
[58:52.72]Yeah.
[58:52.98]No matter how quick you chop or slice, it's still only one stroke at a time.
[58:57.39]Yes.
[58:57.67]You with me up to now?
[58:58.45]Up to now.
[58:58.93]Simple.
[58:59.37]Okay.
[58:59.89]Now then, what do you see?
[59:01.39]Two blades.
[59:01.97]Two blades.
[59:02.53]Okay.
[59:03.05]Twice.
[59:03.35]Two blades.
[59:04.06]Oh, Nancy, hold that thought.
[59:05.70]Because when you turn the handle one full turn...
[59:08.52]Take that away from her face!
[59:10.62]She's gonna take a full step this way.
[59:27.02]So it's a food processor.
[59:29.28]So it's just like a salsa.
[59:44.68]But, you know what, Nancy?
[59:46.12]Nancy?
[59:47.10]Let's say you didn't want to make salsa.
[59:48.74]Okay.
[59:49.40]That was four salsas.
[59:51.10]All you do is you chop up your ingredients, add some molasses and some chili powder.
[59:54.95]Why don't you do that, Nancy?
[59:56.13]Wait.
[59:56.89]Into the salsa?
[59:57.89]Right.
[59:58.23]Turn the handle.
[60:00.11]You ready?
[60:00.69]You put it into the salsa.
[60:01.59]I only have to take the top off.
[60:02.81]I can pour you.
[60:03.33]What?
[60:03.55]See, that saves time, too.
[60:05.00]Alright?
[60:05.42]Are you ready?
[60:06.20]Let's go.
[60:06.58]And you know what, Nancy?
[60:07.90]The beauty is, you know...
[60:09.82]Don't read the ingredient label.
[60:11.18]It's lies.
[60:11.90]Barbecue sauce?
[60:12.34]I'm lost.
[60:12.66]Wait a minute.
[60:13.14]Everybody hold on.
[60:30.46]He's made a salsa, and then he just put molasses in it, and it's a barbecue sauce.
[60:33.22]That's what happened.
[60:34.10]Fresh, delicious gazpacho, done in seconds, but you know what?
[60:55.66]oh Nancy I gotta tell you what's the one job we all hate with those things back there cleanup is complicated the cleanup you rinse and run that's it how about baked on cheese healthy low-fat mayonnaise oh homemade that's wonderful and you know why we need it because now we're in John's deli here we've got three ladies from the studio audience who are gonna put the rocket chef against the rocket clock now on the count of three ladies making a sandwich a deli sandwich
[61:25.47]There's not, like, deli chicken, deli cheese, and mayonnaise in there, right?
[61:29.55]Okay.
[61:29.91]What did you make?
[61:31.88]Okay.
[61:55.43]Alright, they move over to this lady, and she's just like, she didn't do anything.
[61:59.43]It's just all the ingredients are still in there, and she's just like, I didn't understand the instructions.
[62:06.23]So they just move on.
[62:07.13]Oh, okay, yeah, sure, whatever.
[62:09.69]What's this?
[62:10.07]Ooh, chicken salad.
[62:11.21]Now, you're single, so often waste is a problem.
[62:13.85]What is that?
[62:14.51]Right, I always make too much, but this I can use just the right portion.
[62:17.31]Oh, but you know what?
[62:18.04]If you make a small batch or a large batch, it makes no difference.
[62:20.72]There's no waste, because with this seal and save lid... What was in there?
[62:23.92]Oh, thank you.
[62:25.18]Yeah, it's making meatloaf.
[62:27.40]Okay, so it can make sludge.
[62:55.94]Right, like, if it's a sludge-based food, then it'll be fine.
[63:01.76]It doesn't.
[63:03.88]Is it mayo-based?
[63:05.02]Is it a sauce?
[63:05.82]Alright.
[63:06.10]Don't open those.
[63:07.04]Potentially even $40 million, John.

[70:03.18]It's an illegal meth drug den.
[70:08.34]Now, the art of cooking blasts off into the space age with Rocket Chef.

[70:15.57]And it's so easy to use.
[70:16.87]Just insert... Imagine using the Rocket Chef.
[70:20.31]Watch as we make tasty homemade salsa rocket fast.
[70:23.09]Want a slice?
[70:23.83]Just snap in the thick or thin cassette blade and it becomes a supersonic speed slicer.

[70:33.36]No, it is not.
[70:33.72]No, it's not.
[70:34.04]Spinning a blade like this is not as powerful.
[70:35.64]No, it is not.
[70:35.98]Lie.
[70:36.06]Come on, man.
[71:00.12]The thing's cool and it probably works, but more than a professional whipping machine.
[71:07.46]Watch as we put blood in the rocket ship and we separate the plasma and the white blood cells from the red blood cells as a centrifuge.
[71:18.49]That's an application I would use this for.
[71:20.17]I just would.
[71:20.56]That's a pain in the ass.

[75:07.94]Doesn't that smell delicious?
[75:09.22]Doesn't that look delicious?
[75:10.71]Nancy, look at that.
[75:12.59]Oh, gorgeous.
[75:14.07]Oh, wow.
[75:15.37]The sauce.
[75:16.59]But don't forget, with the rocket chef, it also grates those.
[75:21.00]They always do this, and this is my problem.
[75:22.87]Ready?
[75:23.43]Here's my problem with infomercials, and this is a big problem.
[75:26.63]So they make it, oh look, it's so easy.
[75:29.01]Nancy, I've got the sauce.
[75:30.75]I've got the cheese.
[75:31.71]I've even got the chicken salad.
[75:33.11]It's all here in front.
[75:35.01]You need five of these.
[75:38.01]You have to grate the cheese, clean the fucking machine, make the sauce in there, clean the machine.
[75:43.73]They have six of them.
[75:44.87]There's usually like six to ten of these lined up.
[75:47.01]Of course it's going to take you 30 seconds to make a pasta dinner.
[75:50.56]You've got ten things on the counter.
[75:54.38]They should do one where they clean it, and then they do it again.
[75:56.58]Nancy, look at that.
[75:58.76]That's gorgeous.
[76:00.58]Over here, this thing's dirty.
[76:02.86]Don't forget, with the rocket chef, it also grates those hard cheeses.
[76:07.46]Look at that, Nancy.
[76:08.80]You actually did a full Italian meal.
[76:13.77]Yeah, because you have five of them.
[76:16.15]Okay, this has to go on screen right now.
[76:18.20]It's very important.
[76:18.82]It's fucking terrifying.
[76:19.50]I hate it.
[76:42.14]I hate this, but it has to go on screen right now.
[76:48.82]I'm so fucking sorry.
[76:49.88]That was so loud.
[76:50.72]The audio is all screwed up because of the, you know what I mean?
[76:55.58]I'm so sorry.
[76:56.52]I'm just fucking killing you today.
[76:59.62]Killing me too.
[77:00.33]Uh, okay.
[77:15.05]God.
[77:19.79]Wow.
[77:24.79]Jesus.
[77:25.05]Alright, so here comes the pro chefs.
[77:26.33]Okay.
[77:44.86]On the count of three, I want you two to start chopping.
[77:47.23]One, two, three, go.
[77:49.53]And here we have... Does this... Does anybody else kind of feel like this makes, like, the craft and, like, the amount of time and, like, care and passion that this guy probably, like, puts into his food and, like... Oh, look!
[78:05.52]Look!
[78:05.80]Some fucking lady can do it in a machine!
[78:08.22]It takes her ten seconds!
[78:09.30]You're... Yeah!
[78:11.99]Doesn't that kind of...
[78:16.21]I feel like that kind of diminishes what this guy does every day.
[78:22.03]Doesn't it?
[78:24.95]Oh, look, this lady came over and she's not like a professional chef.
[78:30.84]You idiot.
[78:31.56]He's making coleslaw.
[78:32.44]What?
[78:48.43]Hold on a minute.
[78:49.91]They're making these chefs do stuff that only can be made in the Rocket Chef.
[78:57.90]Oh, professional chef, like, doing a crazy, like, he's spinning a knife around.
[79:00.72]Uh, you're gonna be, you're gonna be chopping up, like, cabbage and making coleslaw.
[79:06.82]Oh, you, you're like a, you're like an executive chef at this, uh, at this restaurant behind us.
[79:11.82]Um, just make, like, guacamole.
[79:13.82]Real quick.
[79:15.61]You make coleslaw.
[79:16.69]And it's a lot of chopping.
[79:33.08]I'm gonna be making pesto.
[79:34.38]Pesto, and how long does it usually take?
[79:35.92]Around 40 minutes.
[79:37.38]Well, this isn't that long a show now, is it, John and Nancy?
[79:40.12]You two on the count of three, start chopping.
[79:42.06]We'll see how it goes.
[79:43.26]One, two, three, go.
[79:44.88]Maria, Maria, don't forget, everything in the same bowl at the same time.
[79:49.54]You'll save time, rocket meals, rocket fast.
[79:52.22]That's right, you can throw everything in at once.
[79:54.16]Look at this, Kathy, did you throw everything in?
[79:56.11]The guacamole, check this out, guys.
[79:58.73]And whose is better?
[80:00.73]Oh, you're not even close.
[80:03.37]No, you know what?
[80:03.85]No, no, you, you, you get the, get the fuck out of here.
[80:06.39]Yeah, get out of here, loser.
[80:08.02]What do you think?
[80:08.92]It's amazing.
[80:09.52]It's amazing what this little thing can do.
[80:11.20]That's right.
[80:11.78]In fact, why don't you give Freddie a little bite of that?
[80:14.16]And, oh, coleslaw.
[80:15.34]Coleslaw.
[80:15.72]Look at this.
[80:17.14]Look how finely chopped.
[80:18.36]Very small.
[80:20.46]What's up with this?
[80:21.82]I'm having one of those days.
[80:23.06]You're having one of those days?
[80:24.58]No, please, don't.
[80:25.38]It's a pesto, Juliet.
[80:28.69]Okay, I'm gonna be, let's be real, I gotta be real.
[80:31.51]If I took a cabbage in my hands, and I just fucking crushed it like this and squished it with my fucking hands, and a bowl was underneath,
[80:58.55]And I put mayo in it.
[81:00.55]Just like... And then I stirred it up.
[81:04.85]I don't think anybody would be able to tell the difference.
[81:09.69]It's like this... Not much goes into that really at all.
[81:14.07]I don't know why they're making it seem like this master chef
[81:19.89]Oh, it's just one of those days, you know, it's just... Look at how much better the rocket ship does it.
[81:24.04]I could do it with my bare hands.
[81:26.24]Like carrots.
[81:27.00]I could literally just break up like carrots in my hands.
[81:29.80]And cabbage.
[81:30.32]I mean, it'd be a little chunky, but...
[81:38.75]Wait.
[81:38.99]Oh, I thought they were talking about... I thought they were talking about giving it to like... Oh, your kids.
[81:43.57]Not like a baby.
[81:44.39]Oh, Graham Crackersford.
[82:09.97]Okay.
[82:10.51]Okay.
[82:10.87]It has a few specific uses, but it's a food processor, right?
[82:12.67]It's a food processor that's easy to clean or whatever.
[82:14.55]Alright.
[82:14.85]I think this is the last opportunity we're going to get for the $40 million.
[82:17.78]There's only one opportunity left, right?
[82:39.68]And I said, oh, it can't be this simple.
[82:41.31]It can't be this easy.
[82:42.73]But it was.
[82:43.55]I had mascara on.
[82:45.33]Not a tear came out when I did this onion.
[82:47.59]It really was brilliant.
[82:48.65]I was thinking, this is going to be hard and hard to clean.
[82:51.55]And it was just so easy to clean.
[82:52.63]It was the opposite.
[82:53.57]Whatever it is you're trying to make, just put all the ingredients in, a few turns, and it's done.
[82:59.49]I don't think it's going to be there.
[83:00.95]It's the meth lab again.

[85:10.12]What?
[85:32.50]Wait, was it even part of the same commercial?
[85:59.17]What happened?
[86:29.74]What happened?
[86:30.26]That's... Okay.
[86:35.55]Alright, we got another amazing discovery.
[86:37.91]It's Alphanetics.
[86:43.43]We have the Red Devil Grill.
[86:47.55]This looks really crunchy.
[86:48.73]I'm going to put this one on.
[86:50.50]Smoke meats for real old-fashioned barbecue Absolutely anywhere you go with the revolutionary red devil the portable outdoor kitchen from quantum homewares What a spread
[87:08.54]It's so hot.
[87:09.30]What a terrible day to be cooking in the kitchen.
[87:11.26]Didn't even go in the kitchen.
[87:13.28]How did you make all this incredible looking food?
[87:16.13]There's so much food.
[87:18.75]I want to show you something Mimi and I have found that is so revolutionary.
[87:23.15]It has literally changed the way we think about cooking.
[87:27.04]That's like 50 pounds of food.
[87:30.22]It's a grill.
[87:31.22]Why is there so much food?
[87:32.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.
[87:42.13]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[87:42.65]There are like 13 people here.
[87:56.93]There's like 40 people's worth of food already here.
[88:02.51]They start putting burgers on a grill.
[88:06.13]There's like 15 patties here already.
[88:09.34]And this motherfucker over here has 15.
[88:11.84]Somebody, you guys need to communicate with each other.
[88:14.44]You guys need to communicate.
[88:16.32]You don't cook food over here.
[88:17.76]Like, I got this already going, man.
[88:21.82]You got, there's like three or four people making three or four different parties amounts of food.
[88:25.50]On that big $400 grill that's never ever gonna leave the backyard.
[88:29.45]And we've got 15 burgers and five dogs on the Red Devil and I can take it anywhere.
[88:34.07]What?
[88:34.55]250 square inches of cooking surface means that there's enough room to cook food for all your friends and family.
[88:39.53]But remember the Red Devil isn't a grill.
[88:42.01]It's a portable outdoor kitchen.
[88:44.25]Looks like a grill to me.
[88:47.13]They're your friends.
[88:48.15]I know.
[88:48.57]If all the Red Devil was was a barbecue that I could take with me fishing or tailgating, it'd be terrific.
[88:53.85]Getting called out.
[88:55.13]Believe me, the best is yet to come.
[88:57.83]This is the Red Devil super skillet.
[89:01.36]This is what really makes the Red Devil a complete outdoor kitchen.
[89:04.94]But it's a grill.
[89:05.48]Remove the grilling rack and the radiant heat plate.
[89:08.42]Pop the super skillet over the high output burner.
[89:12.77]It's a man-sized skillet.
[89:17.57]Let me show you what I mean.
[89:19.39]No, stop making food!
[89:21.43]Mimi, the next time we go tailgating with you folks, I'm having some of my famous three-bean Texas toast.
[89:28.76]Right now, like, Jack over there is like... It's just like cooking it in your kitchen.
[89:34.28]Look how easy that is.
[89:35.44]All you do now is you add your beans, okay?
[89:37.50]Then we add our other beans, right?
[89:40.83]Did I turn this off?
[89:41.90]Did I turn the grill off?
[89:43.36]What the fuck?
[90:01.45]boring I love burgers and dogs on the grill okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry guys I'm sorry guys you bring this to a tailgating party uh you're gonna the record is gonna scratch and you're gonna be people are gonna be like
[90:27.03]Are you gonna go tailgating and make salmon and potatoes in a white wine sauce?
[90:36.81]Um... That's not gonna... I don't think that's people are gonna care.
[90:40.18]All these people are here!
[90:53.54]These people don't fucking want to be in a commercial.
[90:56.12]It's just like, they just started to do an advertisement now.
[91:00.14]Look at the reactions.
[91:01.48]They're kind of just like, What the fuck are you guys doing, man?
[91:07.69]Look at... What's going on over there?
[91:11.73]This guy's reading a book.
[91:14.25]What?
[91:23.48]What do you do with the oil?
[91:25.08]What do you do with the oil?
[91:26.86]What do you do with the oil?
[91:28.10]Just pour it out?
[91:29.40]Pour it into the ground?
[91:47.07]Try up my shrimp in my walk at the tailgating party.
[91:51.27]Goes down the tree.
[91:51.91]Wait, it goes down the tree?
[92:16.07]There's a much more important reason for this curved design.
[92:18.29]Ah, that's right.
[92:19.31]You see, what happens is... Somebody said he's just describing what cooking is.
[92:30.29]He's still over there.
[92:32.90]it's the shirt he's still over there I don't know you tell him oh my god this guy this poor guy this poor guy somebody tell him somebody tell him stop doing that very simple once you place the super skillet over the high output burner this parabolic shape directs the flame up and out over the curved surface creating three distinct heating zones
[92:55.65]The center is for medium heat.
[92:57.95]The way around that is the hot zone.
[92:59.83]And around the edges is for warming.
[93:01.62]It's just like having a multi-burner stove that folds up and fits right in the trunk of your car.
[93:05.84]Exactly.
[93:06.48]You can cook complete multi-course meals for the entire family with no more time and trouble than it takes to cook those same old burgers and dogs.
[93:13.39]in fact let me show you here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking on an outdoor grill breakfast now all bacon and sausage needs to be cooked to cook those same old burgers and dogs here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking you can't believe it breakfast now all bacon and sausage needs to be cooked so we're gonna put them on the middle ring remember that's the hot zone
[93:38.66]Still, he goes back to cooking?
[93:39.84]Still?
[93:40.02]This guy is freaking me out.
[93:40.80]I think he's freezing.
[93:41.50]Is he moving?
[93:53.86]Guys, he's not moving.
[93:55.76]I'm going to take my eggs and I'm going to put them in the center.
[93:59.38]Remember, that's the medium zone.
[94:01.30]And just take a look at that.
[94:02.98]And you know the best bit?
[94:04.40]Thanks to the three distinct heating zones, all the food finishes together.
[94:09.39]For instance, your bacon doesn't go cold while you're waiting for your eggs to cook.
[94:12.69]Look at that.
[94:13.65]Exactly.
[94:14.47]And you know what?
[94:15.47]I have some sweet rolls here that we need to warm up.
[94:18.14]well let's put them around the outside then because remember I love that so much whoa what are you doing with all these sweet rolls we are cooking an entire breakfast all at once all in one pan that's right complete meals for the whole family less time and less trouble than it takes no I wouldn't okay so the kids can have frankfurters and beans exactly what's gonna look this one
[94:40.10]oh my god that's right philly cheesesteak authentic who made this look at this the vegetables are sizzling they didn't cook this on the medium heat beautiful the meat's warming in the hot sun and the buns right it's got recalled isn't that beautiful delicious but I gotta tell you here's my favorite
[94:58.64]What's that?
[94:59.26]Fajitas.
[95:00.48]Oh.
[95:00.56]Now, first I grill my chicken and my beef.
[95:02.96]Right.
[95:03.36]Around the hot zone.
[95:04.80]Just add my peppers, add my onions, and then you just mix it all together.
[95:09.32]And in less time and trouble than it takes grilling a piece of chicken, I can be enjoying beautiful fajitas.
[95:15.26]Fajitas.
[95:16.18]On the deck of my friend's boat.
[95:17.54]Now we take the fire tortillas.
[95:18.66]What?
[95:19.44]Put them around the warming zone.
[95:21.16]Chicken.
[95:21.98]I can be enjoying beautiful fajitas.
[95:24.36]Look at that.
[95:25.24]On the deck of my friend's boat.
[95:28.91]The deck of your friend's boat?
[95:32.87]Don't you guys love how you're starting to see through the bullshit a little bit here?
[95:39.27]Tailgating.
[95:40.35]Bring it to a tailgating party.
[95:42.67]Tailgating.
[95:43.09]Hot dogs.
[95:44.37]Yeah, hot dogs and hamburgers.
[95:45.59]Tailgating.
[95:47.57]Cooked salmon in a white wine sauce on the deck of my friend's boat.
[95:52.76]Yeah.
[95:54.00]Okay.
[95:56.22]So.
[95:57.94]Interesting.
[96:00.05]Oh, it's all about the tailgating, though.
[96:02.31]Now we take the fire tortillas, put them around the warming zone, and now, once again, we've got complete meals for the whole family.
[96:10.64]Just look at that.
[96:11.60]That's great.
[96:12.72]But watch this.
[96:13.48]Here's where it gets really handy.
[96:15.46]Simply connect the stay cool handles.
[96:17.42]Dude, they're just walking away from all this shit.
[96:19.05]Carry the super skillet to the table.
[96:21.44]Set it on the Red Devil's serving cradle and dig in.
[96:24.50]Look at that.
[96:25.24]From cookware to heated serving ware in seconds.
[96:28.48]And one left hand to clean.
[96:29.76]And that's the way the heaters are served.
[96:31.43]All these things.
[96:32.43]They're going to come back one time and one of these is going to be on fire.
[96:37.29]And he's going to be like putting it out with a fucking bed sheet or something.
[96:40.33]Like this guy is still here.
[96:41.65]The food stays warm.
[96:43.76]And it's a fun way to eat.
[96:45.34]But we're still not done.
[96:46.72]While you're eating, pop the grill back over the burner.
[96:50.38]No one is going to do this.
[97:07.45]No one would do this.
[97:11.09]No, it's burgers.
[97:12.53]It's, bro.
[97:15.01]It's, it's burgers.
[97:17.97]Hot dogs.
[97:19.25]Hamburgers, hot dogs.
[97:20.48]Maybe, like, a piece of, like, chicken, like, chicken wings, chicken thighs, like, grilled fish is fine, right?
[97:27.62]But, like, they're just trying to make up all these reasons to use it.
[97:31.08]No one's going to do that.
[97:32.28]It's like burgers and dogs and...
[97:34.54]fish and foil and like just be no but do it like be realistic about it and maybe I would think about it no pound cake yeah back to the red devil turn the one touch temperature control to low and you've got a portal hot plate that'll keep you food warm for hours while you're out having fun I want this guy to be in the pool eventually just swimming around at your backyard guard parties like today or it'd be great for wedding receptions or birthdays at the park but here's the best part
[97:59.47]It's on the ground.
[98:00.13]He's brushing it on the ground.
[98:02.51]Yeah, my friend's boat.
[98:03.95]Yeah, we're at my friend's house.
[98:05.47]Just wiping fucking charred bits on his ground.
[98:26.02]the surfaces you cooked on face in you don't have to worry about getting grease all over everything drop the heavy duty grill stand down close the legs pop it into the carry case zip it up don't forget there's a compartment here for the gas bottle as well
[98:42.49]And within a minute or two of having finished your meal, you're done and back to the fun.
[98:46.57]Guys, I think my burgers are done.
[98:48.25]I bet you haven't.
[98:48.87]You like a burger, Rob?
[98:50.07]Man, I can't believe it.
[98:51.93]The Red Devil cooked those burgers as fast as my big backyard grill.
[98:55.34]That's right, Rob.
[98:56.06]But remember, in the same time you cooked burgers and dogs on your grill, we made on the Red Devil Texas chili, sauteed fish and wine and dill.
[99:05.12]Fish and chips.
[99:06.53]Fried chicken, shrimp Ster-fry.
[99:08.99]Also complete meals.
[99:10.23]Beans and franks, Philly cheese steaks, even a complete breakfast.
[99:14.26]Even chicken fajitas and lobster.
[99:16.16]And we're only halfway done.
[99:17.40]That's the instant.
[99:23.32]More than 250 square inches of cooking surface means that there's enough room to cook food for all your friends and family.
[99:29.20]But remember, the Red Devil isn't a grill.
[99:31.68]It's a portable outdoor kitchen.
[99:34.09]Each and every time.
[99:36.13]And just because it's portable doesn't mean that it's small.
[99:38.71]Hey, Rob.
[99:39.57]I say you've got 15 burgers and five dogs cooking on that big $400 grill that's never, ever gonna leave the backyard.
[99:45.65]And we've got... So he knew.
[99:48.34]Why...
[99:52.57]Was he acting like he didn't even know they were in his backyard?
[99:59.70]Right?
[99:59.98]Like, it's like, oh, hey!
[100:01.01]Hey, Rob!
[100:01.55]We're, like, cooking over here!
[100:02.51]You're not gonna be able to beat us!
[100:03.77]And the guy turns around and it's like he saw a fucking ghost.
[100:11.33]can't believe it meal you're done guys I think my burgers are done I bet you haven't like a burger man I can't believe it the red devil cooked those burgers as fast as my big backyard grill that's right and we made lobster oh my god this is so ridiculous wine and dill fish and chips
[100:30.75]Fried chicken.
[100:31.88]Shrimp Ster fry.
[100:33.22]Also complete meals.
[100:34.46]Beans and franks.
[100:35.74]Philly cheesesteaks.
[100:37.12]Even a complete breakfast.
[100:38.48]Even chicken fajitas and lobster.
[100:40.38]And we're only halfway done.
[100:41.52]Yeah, you had five grills.
[100:44.22]And when we come back, we'll show you how the Superdome package turns your Red Devil into a roaster, a smoker, a steamer, a poacher, even an outdoor oven that lets you bake breads, cakes, and what I've got cooking right now.
[100:55.93]Mixed favorite food and something I'm sure you've never seen cooked outdoors before.
[100:59.35]No.
[101:01.09]You'll see.
[101:02.84]So keep enjoying your food and we'll be right back to... Okay, where's part two?
[101:07.30]I want it right now.
[101:08.94]Did I do part two?
[101:09.80]I think I queued it up already.
[101:12.40]Yep, this far.
[101:13.16]Thank God, part two.
[101:15.00]Get your hands off thatm that's dessert.
[101:16.00]I want to show them the rest of this first.
[101:17.00]Okay but that better be good.
[101:19.00]Don't worry. Okay.
[101:20.00]Desert.
[101:29.00]Back to the tailgating.
[101:36.00]Wait it got recalled? People were being burned? Lit on fire?
[101:43.02]What?
[101:44.30]WHAT?
[101:46.18]What?
[101:47.66]WHAT!?
[101:53.30]Holy shit.
[102:00.41]The intake tube can warm up to as high as 750 degrees.
[102:03.05]What the fuck?
[102:12.66]It would get so hot that it would- sometimes it would collapse!
[102:16.98]Holy shit!
[102:20.20]Holy shit!
[102:25.95]Oh my god!
[102:29.38]And for that, you're going to need an oven.
[102:30.76]Are you serious?
[102:31.46]For that, you're going to need the Red Devil Super Dome.
[102:34.42]It's specially designed to work in conjunction with the Super Skillet to turn your Red Devil into a portable oven.
[102:40.55]So now you can have friendly feasts anywhere, including the big game on Thanksgiving.
[102:44.35]Exactly.
[102:45.15]Simply put your turkey, chicken, or even a prime rib... No, no turkey.
[102:48.99]No turkeys, man.
[102:52.31]No, don't put a turkey in here.
[102:57.21]Holy shit!
[103:01.63]Don't put a turkey in here.
[103:02.49]Holy shit, that's fucking insane.
[103:03.69]So how does this end?
[103:04.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[103:04.69]Wait a second.
[103:04.99]Hold on.
[103:05.15]Hold on.
[103:31.94]Why is this guy the authority on food here?
[103:34.64]What, on barbecue?
[103:37.90]Absolutely anywhere.
[103:39.46]Hold on, did you see that?
[103:42.34]Phil, we've got... Phil, and he's like, yep.
[103:46.51]Something you're going to love under this one.
[103:48.27]Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?
[103:50.85]Right.
[103:52.23]What do you mean, I don't believe in... I don't believe in barbecue sauce?
[103:57.07]And you can tell that Phil is fucking annoying, by the way, at these parties.
[104:01.42]Like, every time somebody brings up barbecue, you know that he's going to spend, like, 20 minutes talking about it.
[104:06.92]So they've got to convince Phil.
[104:09.51]You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?
[104:12.43]Look at this.
[104:13.23]And it's like they're calling him out, like...
[104:15.56]He's this barbecue authority at the party.
[104:17.72]Just add moist wood chips underneath the grilling rack.
[104:20.53]Oh my goodness gracious.
[104:21.91]And you can cook meats like delicious smoked turkey, even real old-fashioned barbecue ribs.
[104:26.83]You think they can convince Phil?
[104:28.65]Smoking gives the meat that delicious barbecue flavor all the way through.
[104:32.61]Mimi, try this.
[104:34.65]You ready?
[104:35.07]Oh, beef brisket.
[104:37.99]Now let's just check the meat here and see if it's done.
[104:40.35]Wait, what is this thing?
[104:41.98]Yes, it is.
[104:42.90]Oh.
[104:43.36]You ready?
[104:45.54]Just try this.
[104:47.64]Mmm, that's delicious.
[104:49.80]But look, what is that?
[104:51.42]That's the optional Perfect Chef grilling fork with a built-in meat thermometer.
[104:55.78]It takes the guesswork out of cooking, whether you're indoors and out.
[104:59.14]Simply press the button and the light will tell you exactly how your meat is cooked every time.
[105:04.62]That's a great idea.
[105:06.14]It's the perfect companion to your portable smoke and a roaster machine.
[105:09.93]Alright, we're almost done with this one, but this is bizarre.
[105:14.55]Why don't you head off back down to the beach for some delicious clam bake?
[105:18.77]Ooh, look at that.
[105:20.11]It's a steamer that you can take with you anywhere.
[105:22.55]What about Phil?
[105:23.07]Perfect for steaming fresh vegetables or add a little bit of fish stock or a little bit of wine.
[105:27.35]Wait, I want to know.
[105:28.41]I got to see the end of Phil's art.
[105:29.39]The very best thing is the special design of the Superdome system.
[105:33.13]The heat radiates so evenly that I can literally cook anything I can cook in my oven outdoors anywhere from cornbread.
[105:40.94]All-American...
[105:42.53]Meatloaf and cornbread.
[105:43.73]Look at that.
[105:44.59]And that's baking.
[105:46.47]Outdoors.
[105:47.45]Ready for dessert?
[105:48.61]What?
[105:49.45]I bake the cake.
[105:50.69]You bake the cake.

[105:56.19]Pineapple.
[105:57.47]Upside down cake.

[106:05.17]Just make a grill, man.
[106:06.65]Like, make a grill.

[106:52.66]What is happening in this video?
[107:05.88]You're cooking pasta on the grill?
[107:08.46]Why?
[107:09.02]That looks fantastic.
[107:10.02]Explain why you did that and not
[107:35.99]On a pot, in a pot.
[107:38.81]Why did you do this?
[107:40.23]Why?
[107:40.57]Explain to me why.
[107:42.57]No, explain why.
[107:45.45]Why do it here?
[107:46.71]Like, seriously, that's what I would do.
[107:48.05]Now tell me, why?
[108:07.16]You have a toaster oven that's inside of your RV right now.
[108:10.75]It's perfectly fine.
[108:12.23]Why did you do this on the grill?
[108:14.78]Explain to me why.
[108:18.27]What's your favorite thing about the Red Devil when you're out?
[108:20.79]Well, when we go picnicking with the kids, it can be a little finicky.
[108:24.09]So with this, we can put a wide variety of foods and cook them at the same time, and everybody can have what they like.
[108:30.65]Oh, that's great.
[108:31.79]So what's your favorite thing about this shape?
[108:33.85]Well, it even cooks pizza, too.
[108:35.17]I love pizza.
[108:35.71]Hi, Ida.
[108:36.42]Hi, Ida.
[108:45.47]Don't tell people to make pizza on a grill like that.
[108:49.26]Right?
[108:52.09]hamburgers hot dogs what the is that we put the chicken in first right and let it go for about a half an hour and then you add the vegetables whatever you want in it you can put onions you can put just about anything in the world that you like and then it's all one and uh it just cooks great doesn't that make a change from burgers and dogs oh yeah yeah in fact we used to use the microwave all the time in the rv
[109:16.59]Grilled pizza's good.
[109:18.07]That was a bad take.
[109:18.87]What about Phil?
[109:19.93]What do you guys got on here?
[109:20.93]Somebody said human meat.
[109:43.34]Oh, they've got... What other weird shit do you guys have underneath there?
[109:47.38]You're cooking pasta on the grill.
[109:49.00]You're cooking... What have you got?
[109:49.88]Chicken nuggets?
[109:50.40]What's in here?
[109:50.90]Well, it's a human leg.
[109:53.60]You know, we cook human legs and human arms sometimes.
[110:01.82]Oh, that's not as weird as the pasta.
[110:04.66]But still fucked up, by the way.
[110:06.34]Still incredibly fucked up.
[110:08.02]fit into the RV very nicely.
[110:10.04]Plus, usually we use microwave food a lot, and this is much tastier.
[110:16.04]Where's Phil?
[110:16.93]Thanks, Gary!
[110:17.87]Where's Phil?
[110:19.23]You really can't cook anything anywhere with the Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen.

[110:45.55]Devil portable outdoor.
[110:47.97]Hey, save some for me.
[110:49.55]Hey, kitchen.

[110:51.93]Hey, save some for me.
[110:54.49]Now you can cook any.
[111:03.87]you concerned.
[111:06.11]If I went to a backyard barbecue and there was a full 30 pound turkey on the table and it was like, I cooked this on the grill.
[111:15.53]I'd go, I'm not eating that.
[111:18.09]I am not going to cut into that one.
[111:19.91]That's something I'm going to avoid.
[111:22.73]I'm not going to eat this.
[111:24.07]It's going to be like, oh, that's cool.
[111:26.10]I guess what you just told me is sort of interesting.
[111:28.74]You cooked something on the grill like this.
[111:33.06]I'm not going to eat it.
[111:35.87]That's crazy.
[111:38.41]That's crazy.
[111:39.39]Wild, wild world of infomercial products.
[111:48.79]Now that we saw that grill, how about the micro grill?
[111:55.66]How about the Bissell Big Green?
[111:58.64]I don't know what this one is, but we're going to watch it.
[112:02.38]We're going to turn that way fucking down.
[112:05.17]Tracking.
[112:13.43]God, the crusty tracking.
[112:15.63]Oh my God.
[112:22.75]Coming up next on Helpful Hints.
[112:24.67]Helpful Hints.
[112:26.19]Oh, no, that's ruined.
[112:28.17]No, it's not.
[112:29.18]Watch those messes disappear in seconds with today's Helpful Hints.
[112:33.16]Like I was trying to adjust the volume and was hitting tracking.

[112:37.46]Able to take on even the toughest things in seconds.
[112:40.18]Doing jobs no
[112:42.07]Are you sucking shit out of the sink?
[112:47.75]I'm interested completely in this one.
[112:50.96]What are you sucking out of the sink?
[113:13.00]Okay.
[113:16.00]That's a great name already.
[113:21.70]And here to show us how it works is a woman who's helped all of America with her helpful hints.
[113:26.59]She's the creator of Mary Ellen's WOW laundry stain removers.
[113:29.65]Cool.
[113:30.51]14 million of you have bought her helpful hints books.
[113:32.71]Uh-huh.
[113:32.93]She's been on just about every talk show in the country.
[113:35.31]And you'll read her column in every issue of Woman's Day.
[113:37.71]Please welcome Mary Ellen Peckham.
[113:42.55]I love her.
[113:43.85]I love her already.
[113:45.40]If she sucks it out of a vacuum cleaner, I'm gonna fucking shit my pants.
[113:56.71]Wait, that was just a helpful hint.
[113:58.03]What?
[114:16.70]Wait, that was her opener.
[114:17.72]It was like, hey, here's a hint.
[114:18.82]Like, whip your ketchup around.
[114:20.99]Many products throughout the years, but I never have until this machine.
[114:24.67]Because it's going to change the way we all clean our homes.
[114:28.53]Ow!
[114:28.63]Yeah, new technology, a fucking vacuum cleaner.
[114:30.19]What the fuck?
[114:30.61]What do you see?
[115:00.40]And then it goes .
[115:02.17]You see, we added a funny burp for the kids.
[115:06.43]There we go, it's all gone.
[115:09.08]Alright, that's powerful, Mary Ellen.
[115:10.74]And because of that power, it makes the greatest deep cleaning extraction machine that you could use to clean your carpet, your upholstery, your floors, your car, your boat, your RVs, things that are big and things that are very expensive.
[115:22.92]Alright, now those are pretty big claims you're making here, so let's make you prove them, alright?
[115:26.60]We've collected the dirty dozen of stain makers.
[115:29.16]Come on over to the table.
[115:29.94]My favorite.
[115:30.72]And this is really a collection of the things that make the worst stain.
[115:34.60]What is what makes them okay that fucking click sound is gonna kill me Coffee coffee stains chocolate milk oh yeah Like a jar dog piss That's it
[116:01.54]That was not that much wine.
[116:02.78]That was barely any wine.
[116:04.28]Usually on my carpet.
[116:05.32]That's right.
[116:05.96]Everybody's carpet.
[116:06.98]Okay, we have some carpet out here for you.
[116:08.70]Now, you've got your choice.
[116:09.78]You've got a low pile, a Berber, and a high pile.
[116:13.27]And what are we going to do?
[116:14.05]He takes it back.
[116:15.19]She's like, we don't have any dog urine we can use.
[116:17.47]And he's like, hold on just a second.
[116:18.61]And he goes off stage.
[116:19.59]And he's like, this is it.
[116:20.57]Do it for a second.
[116:21.31]And comes back in.
[116:23.41]Okay, I would say the Berber because it's the most expensive and it's the lightest color.
[116:26.66]This will be the hardest for you to get out, I think.
[116:28.36]Okay, so let's spill it like we do at home.
[116:30.26]Pour it on.
[116:30.62]Okay, here it goes.
[116:33.39]Oh, what the?
[116:34.66]Oh, no.
[116:36.00]Oh, ruined.
[116:49.45]And then I like smush it all around and then I clean it up and then take some soap and put it on there.
[116:53.45]You're doing absolutely the wrong thing.
[116:55.01]First of all, you're just moving that stain and you're making it bigger and bigger.
[116:57.91]It's going down into the padding of the carpet.
[117:00.09]And guess what?
[117:00.69]The soap just attracts more dirt.
[117:02.90]Soap attracts dirt?
[117:03.92]It does unless you get it all up.
[117:05.74]So you've got to blot and blot and blot and that's almost impossible.
[117:08.74]Hasn't it happened to you?
[117:09.56]You've gone to bed at night and the stain's gone.
[117:11.38]You wake up in the morning and it's...
[117:13.30]It's back again.
[117:14.26]That's true.
[117:14.90]Oh, it actually does happen.
[117:16.08]Oh, it is actually.
[117:17.26]It's stupid.
[117:17.70]I hate it.
[117:18.44]It's annoying.
[117:19.32]Yep.
[117:33.99]So it's got dual tube technology.
[117:36.07]So that's a special proprietary cleaning solution.
[117:38.35]I just want one of them just like turn it on and be like and like everybody laughs.
[117:41.44]That's very dangerous too.
[117:42.56]Don't do that.
[118:08.72]listen to this audience listen to this audience it's like they're like they're like kind of like heckling a little like they can't believe this
[118:19.87]but getting a stain out of a carpet that's not like it's not that hard you just have to be persistent and have the right cleaning tools it is the big green clean machine one clean so listen to this
[118:41.36]I'm just imagining like a fucking large soda gets like thrown down here and hits the back wall like no fucking way.
[118:46.95]I can smell this too.
[118:48.69]It smells great.
[118:49.33]It smells like you've been cleaning all day long.
[118:52.13]Now what do you do?
[118:53.17]You take the tank and you dump it in the toilet and the stain will go down the drain.
[118:58.39]Alright, everyone.
[119:00.41]Alright, so we're gonna do ketchup.
[119:17.58]Yeah, that wasn't bad at all.
[119:18.52]You can just take it from room to room and follow spots wherever they happen, right?
[119:21.22]Absolutely.
[119:21.84]Now let's lay that ketchup stain down.
[119:23.80]Okay, I'll take the top off and here we go.
[119:25.51]Little dollop right there.
[119:26.91]Okay, I'm going to mix it in right there.
[119:28.67]How's that?
[119:29.85]Okay, now... That's not even... People are acting like he shit on the couch.
[119:36.14]He didn't... And that's pet hair all over your sofa.
[119:39.35]I've got a great one.
[119:40.97]He didn't get on the couch and, like, shit on it.
[119:44.45]I've got a great one for pet lovers, okay?
[119:47.53]And that's pet hair all over your sofa, your chairs.
[119:50.07]It's a real mess.
[119:51.23]In the past, I used to tell people to fill a spray bottle with water, then spritz down their furniture, and then take a brush and brush off all that pet hair.
[119:59.28]No more.
[120:00.22]Just use one of those rollers.
[120:02.00]...because of this special attachment that's made for upholstery.
[120:05.30]Alright.
[120:06.24]It's useful.
[120:08.52]It's useful.
[120:12.77]You would literally buy anything if there was a wholesome, sweet, middle-aged woman telling you to do it.
[120:18.05]That's not true.
[120:24.39]And I'm just extracting the water.
[120:25.65]You just saved this couch.
[120:29.15]You just saved this couch from a very costly mistake.
[120:31.94]Would have been very expensive.
[120:33.34]It was easy to do, by the way.
[120:34.54]I just pulled the trigger, put the water and cleaning solution down, and it pulled it right up.
[120:37.98]And it's not very wet at all.
[120:39.84]It'll be dry by morning.
[120:41.52]Now, I'll tell you what I want to introduce you to.
[120:42.78]This shit does work, though.
[120:44.20]It's like a carpet cleaner, guys.
[120:45.62]The carpet cleaner is the same technology.
[120:47.61]It's like a doctor.
[120:48.13]Who is this?
[120:53.43]seen so far very very impressive congratulations this is just the beginning this machine is three machines in one it's a dry vacuum cleaner it's a wet shop vacuum and it's a deep cleaning machine five hundred dollars worth of machines and this machine is as powerful as all those
[121:08.65]I mean, they've been using this same exact technology for like 50 years.
[121:12.05]It works.
[121:13.45]In fact, I will show you later they can unclog a drain.
[121:16.51]Alright, we'll hold them to that, won't we?
[121:17.81]I want to see that demonstration.
[121:19.19]Right now, I'm going to show you just how powerful it is as a dry vacuum.
[121:21.97]Mary Ellen, if you turn that on.
[121:24.17]It can handle dirt.
[121:26.61]That's not impressive.
[121:27.67]Even nuts and bolts.
[121:30.83]Why are they cheering?
[121:32.25]Thanks, Joe.
[121:33.13]Now, if you'd hand me the bowling ball and attachment down under that counter.
[121:36.19]Okay, you're not going to try and suck up the bowling ball.
[121:39.74]Oh, no.
[121:40.14]There's no way that's going to work.
[121:41.44]You'll put that attachment on there.
[121:43.14]You'll see it's clear.
[121:44.58]No strings or wires in there.
[121:47.33]Now, John, what I'm going to do is I'm going to lie down on the table.
[121:49.79]And I'm going to lie facing up on the table.
[121:51.23]What I want you to do is hold the bowling ball over my face.
[121:54.35]And I trust the suction.
[121:55.89]I created this goddamn product.
[121:58.79]Ooh, be careful.
[122:00.07]Show the people that there's no glue on there.
[122:02.79]Now, Mary Ellen, if you'll turn that powerful motor on.
[122:08.72]That's how much I trusted.
[122:11.42]What?
[122:31.23]Mary Ellen, I think you've gone a little bit too far this time.
[122:34.47]What is he rigged up to?
[122:35.39]Just a little bit, you'll see that Tom is in the hot seat or maybe the cool seat because underneath him, can you see that?
[122:42.11]Are they going to put it on his head?
[122:44.39]Now, as you can see, we've got a big green clean machine set up out there.
[122:47.45]What?
[122:47.59]We've got a situation set up just like Eric's test.
[122:51.07]We're going to put a bowling ball.
[122:54.28]Any time during the rest of the show, that motor fails or burns out under the stress, that ball is going to fall off.
[123:01.24]Hi!
[123:06.32]I thought they were going to put it on his head and turn it on and suck his head and then put, drop the lever as if he was going to fall into the water and I thought I was going to keep him up by holding his head.
[123:17.79]I didn't, okay.
[123:18.69]Hold on, I got to get this ready.
[123:35.11]This is important.
[123:42.24]This is important.
[123:42.82]Just bear with me for one second, please.
[123:55.73]Okay.
[123:56.69]I'm going to go away for a second.
[124:04.09]I don't think he has anything to worry about but there's something about so far because we have been cleaning our homes the wrong way Joe if your hair was dirty what would you do
[124:31.67]What the fuck is this?
[124:32.83]Is he alright?
[124:58.95]Somebody went in to get him.
[125:00.57]Somebody went in to get him.
[125:01.83]Save him.
[125:02.37]Turn up face cam.
[125:03.25]Now I'm back.
[125:30.03]I missed everything.
[125:30.91]You owe me for this.
[125:49.45]Come on, Joe.
[125:52.03]Now, Joe, the only difference when you're using the big green clean machine to clean floors is to use the special floor attachment.
[125:58.11]You want to grab that one over there?
[125:59.43]Okay, this is it.
[126:00.38]It snaps on very simply.
[126:02.42]Also, use the floor care formula that is absolutely marvelous for tile, vinyl, marble, lots of things.
[126:09.12]Everything but wood because everybody knows water cannot be used on wood floors.
[126:13.24]Look at this dumbass shit.
[126:14.62]Everybody but Joe, that is.
[126:16.92]I just keep thinking of the guy in the water tank.
[126:20.11]Ooh.
[126:20.21]Holy shit.
[126:42.10]What happens when you're watering a hanging plant?
[126:44.48]Well, usually I pour the water in up here and it comes right down the drain holes and goes all over the floor.
[126:47.94]And it makes a mess.
[126:48.86]Now you're going to understand why I sold 10 million books on watering day
[126:54.51]you're oh no no no no no no oh no oh no oh no no no no no what happens we've been talking about stains here now but what happens when a stain really gets set in what do you do then now that's a toughie but come on over here and I'm gonna show you what a great job the big green clean machine does
[127:14.11]Okay, now on this step, we have grape juice in there.
[127:16.65]And that is tough.
[127:18.27]All you have to do is turn on the pump.
[127:20.11]Just the pump.
[127:20.76]And pre-treat the stain by just laying down the cleaning solution.
[127:23.84]Okay, just spray on the cleaning solution like this.
[127:25.32]Just like that.
[127:25.72]Now, go have a cup of coffee.
[127:28.44]Or maybe I'll give you a helpful hint while that does the job.
[127:31.44]I'd like that.
[127:31.96]Okay?
[127:32.68]Oh, I do have a helpful... I actually want to hear this.
[127:34.42]You know that you can remove chewing gum from carpeting with WD-40?
[127:38.68]No way.
[127:39.18]That's just...
[127:42.45]Excellent.
[128:07.50]Why can't I skip this ad?
[128:11.35]Is it blood?
[128:11.91]That wasn't blood.
[128:15.63]Some motherfucker is sitting right next to the camera's microphone in the audience and they're clapping is what you're hearing.
[128:21.78]That's what's going on.
[128:22.52]That's what you're hearing.
[128:26.08]Somebody is too close to the mic in the audience.
[128:29.78]Missed one.
[128:53.51]you can it's okay you can tell just how unenthusiastic most people in the audience are because listen to the we got somebody miked up we have an audience member miked the up so we can tell every time they clap their hands every single time and what they're doing is they're like kind of trying to blend in like
[129:15.23]They're not really, they don't really care.
[129:16.67]They're not participating.
[129:18.01]They don't really give a shit.
[129:19.55]And we can hear it in real time.
[129:20.94]We know how they feel in real time.
[129:31.91]One, two, three, four.
[129:32.72]Five, six.
[129:33.08]That's it.
[129:34.24]That's it.
[129:34.60]That's it.
[129:50.29]Alright, now here's the situation as we've set it up.
[129:52.67]We've contacted a number of different carpet cleaning companies, the ones that usually send you these flyers in the mail, and normally they advertise low, low prices per room.
[130:00.41]And we've asked them to give us an estimate based on two rooms, two hallways, and three pieces of living room furniture.
[130:07.77]Now these estimates are going to be based on the same exact job that the big green clean machine can do.
[130:13.75]Now they have no idea they're going to be on camera because we've hidden cameras all through the house.
[130:18.02]There's what they call a lipstick camera.
[130:20.08]Hi, Mom.
[130:20.92]That's a very small camera.
[130:22.14]Can you see it?
[130:22.90]And we've got microphones all over the house.
[130:24.54]What?
[130:24.82]That's literally right there.
[130:26.10]Here in the dining area.
[130:28.56]Another lipstick camera up there.
[130:30.38]And our actress, Sharon, who's playing our housewife, will be seated here, hopefully getting the people giving us the estimates in these chairs.
[130:36.87]We'll be able to hear and see exactly what's going on.
[130:39.01]This is fucking weird.
[130:39.97]Make yourself comfy.
[130:48.76]for the furniture and the carpet 450
[131:18.27]Somebody said it's a ghost camp.
[131:21.21]You can't even hear it.
[131:23.03]To catch a cleaner?
[131:24.54]Okay, that?
[131:25.00]Okay, wait a second, say that again.
[131:44.27]Now, say that again.
[131:45.37]Say that again, but into this microphone that I have in front of me.
[131:51.77]Can you say that into the pot of flowers just real quick?
[131:54.27]But I just don't want to have to call these guys in every time I've got a spill.
[131:58.08]Now remember, the way to prevent a spill from turning into a stain is to act fast.
[132:03.30]Alright, now let me see if I can summarize what we've seen here.
[132:05.56]The Big Green Clean Machine is a powerful vacuum cleaner that uses a reusable bag.
[132:09.80]It's also a powerful wet vac.
[132:11.46]It picked up that Kool-Aid in one gulp.
[132:13.58]It also deep cleaned some carpets, got out that really deep down dirt, and also gobbled up some of the worst stains I've ever seen and replaced.
[132:22.10]Are we gonna check in with the husband?
[132:23.20]That's a lot of power and a lot of equipment.
[132:25.61]That is really terrific.
[132:28.25]Now we're going to show you what you get.
[132:29.85]Will you help me out, Eric?
[132:31.17]I sure will.
[132:31.65]Okay, Eric, what do we have here?
[132:33.09]We have the dry vacuum accessories, including the washable filter bag.
[132:36.53]We need to check in with the husband, right?
[132:38.45]We have the wet vac attachment to unclog the drain.
[132:41.22]We have the caddy organizer for your closet to keep everything handy.
[132:44.88]We have an instruction manual, and this is nice, an instructional videotape to get the best results from your machine.
[132:50.08]And to get you started, a bottle of the carpet care formula and the bare floor formula.
[132:54.12]That's a lot with this machine.
[132:55.76]That's a lot.
[132:58.14]I kind of feel like... Does anybody else feel like that book is actually kind of, probably kind of interesting?
[133:03.72]The Mary Ellen random hints.
[133:15.71]I'm like, look, spin the ketchup bottle around.
[133:17.67]I feel like that's a great bathroom book.
[133:20.73]I really, I honestly feel like that would be, it's probably like just a bullet points.
[133:24.65]Like thousands of little bullet points of like two or three sentences.
[133:27.55]Where you just kind of go, oh, that's kind of funny.
[133:29.95]Even if it's like doesn't work.
[133:31.71]I feel like that's a great toilet book.
[133:35.05]I really do.
[133:35.79]I feel like that's like a cool, oh, that's fun.
[133:39.53]It's just life hacks.
[133:42.05]Yeah, but I don't know.
[133:44.74]If you're a 1993 grandmother, maybe.
[133:50.19]Would you buy a Mary Ellen joke book?
[133:53.35]You guys remember those?
[133:54.61]I would.
[133:55.79]Like, oh, funny little Mary Ellen's funny jokes.
[133:59.97]You remember those?
[134:00.45]It was like 500 pages long, and it was just these two sentence little jokey little quips.
[134:10.24]You guys remember those?
[134:10.84]I used to read them.
[134:15.65]Oh, there he is.
[134:16.67]Oh, yuck.
[134:17.25]Aren't you disgusted?
[134:18.43]You gotta buy this now.
[134:36.06]Introducing America's total cleaning system.
[134:38.92]We got to save this green clean machine.
[134:41.56]It's three powerful cleaning machines in one in the dry mode.
[134:44.68]It's a state of the art dual filtration vacuum cleaner.
[134:47.50]Dual filtration technology.
[134:49.20]It's a wetback that gobbles up spills in seconds.
[134:52.26]And it's a self-contained deep cleaning extraction machine for carpets, upholstery and floors.
[134:57.22]I like that.
[134:57.68]It looked like ice coffee.
[134:58.68]That looks like an ice coffee advertisement with like the like the pillowing cream and the coffee.
[135:02.71]I like that.
[135:04.82]Wait, the guy's name is John Bissell?
[135:10.89]Actually, the guy's name is just John Bissell.
[135:15.25]This is the man himself.
[135:16.49]Really?
[135:17.02]Holy shit.
[135:17.64]I believe that the Big Green Clean Machine is the finest unit
[135:28.60]Holy shit, it's actually John Bissell.

[148:04.94]Hey, Frank, get her husband back over here.
[148:19.41]I'm going to see how long he can put his head under there for without puking.
[148:21.61]I know I've seen a lot of people say a few things about...
[148:49.66]You should do an infomercial thing.
[148:50.80]You're acting like I haven't made that call yet.
[148:58.60]You're acting like I haven't made that call.
[149:06.49]I have.
[149:06.91]I'm not saying a fucking single other thing about this.
[149:10.01]Okay, turn it on.
[149:18.77]Stop!
[149:19.85]My head.
[149:26.37]That's a fucking $300 cashmere shirt you just ruined with your... Don't touch my shirt.
[149:31.59]I thought that was the same guy for a second.
[149:34.25]I had to take a double take.
[149:36.31]I thought that was the same person.
[149:41.78]It's like it's him again.
[149:42.92]What?
[149:43.06]What the fuck?
[150:05.09]Great, it came right out.
[150:06.13]You bet, Joel.
[150:07.03]And come here, I'm going to show you what's worse than dust.
[150:10.17]It lives right here in your mattress.
[150:12.71]And they're called dust mites.
[150:14.67]And do you know there's 18,000 dust mites to a gram of dust?
[150:18.60]That's pretty disgusting.
[150:19.90]That is really disgusting.
[150:21.18]But with the Big Green Clean Machine, goodbye to the dust mites.
[150:28.42]Oh, come on.
[150:30.30]You had such an opportunity to go.
[150:32.02]No, no, help me.
[150:35.28]No.
[150:36.18]How?
[150:36.84]Really?
[150:39.40]Unbelievable.
[150:39.88]They missed an opportunity.
[150:40.98]Alright, I'm going to finish this mattress.
[150:42.66]When's the last time you cleaned your mattress?
[150:44.75]It's easy to do with the big green clean machine, and it's a must if you've got a bed wetter.
[150:49.45]Believe me.
[150:50.65]Joe, are you out there yet?
[150:52.45]What?
[150:52.73]Mary Ellen, you know, a lot of people spend time
[150:57.19]Who is she talking about?
[150:58.07]And let's open it up.
[150:59.27]As you see, we have a full 14 pound turkey inside of here cooking from all the vortex power.
[151:18.42]Alright, I think we're good to go on this one.
[151:37.95]I think we got everything out of this one.
[151:40.45]Suck it up so easily.
[151:42.33]Let some of our audience members try out the big green machine.
[151:45.38]Here's what's happening.
[151:46.18]How are the results?
[151:47.32]Joe, this sheet of linoleum was covered in mud, dirt, and grime.
[151:50.74]And it sucked it up so easily.
[151:52.90]Look at this.
[151:54.60]Pulls the dirt right up there.
[151:55.80]Beautiful.
[151:56.94]Alright.
[151:57.24]I'm going to turn off that machine.
[151:59.46]How are we doing on a little chair here?
[152:01.40]Great.
[152:01.66]I didn't know you could do your own light color upholstery.
[152:04.52]I always thought you had to have a professional.
[152:06.78]Alright.
[152:07.12]Not in this case.
[152:09.45]It'd be so loud in this room.
[152:10.57]It'd be so loud in here.
[152:22.58]Thanks, Eric.
[152:22.94]The test is over.
[152:41.60]How do we know there wasn't some trickery involved?
[152:44.58]Yeah, let's see the trickery.
[152:45.78]In the interest of science, I just gotta do it.
[152:50.02]I just gotta do it.
[152:55.14]No, don't!
[152:59.75]Oh, no.
[153:01.01]I don't know if he made it.
[153:08.07]Why is everybody acting?
[153:10.53]like he got like crushed by like a cinder block.
[153:28.25]Well, it's a good thing I've come up with a new helpful hint for the big green clean machine.
[153:32.99]I'm going to be extracting water out of Tom today.
[153:35.41]Right?
[153:37.89]Seriously, folks, the big green clean machine is going to keep all those valuables in your home valuable.
[153:44.13]It was a bowl of missile cleaner.

[154:21.35]Why would you freeze on this?
[154:22.93]It's so like... It's so weird.
[154:27.33]Why?
[154:27.75]Okay, we're gonna go to this one.

[155:15.91]That came from this commercial.
[155:18.27]I've seen this probably a thousand times.
[155:21.26]I have made weird references to this and never explained it.
[155:23.90]I just kind of copied her talking.
[155:29.30]And people might have just been like, what is he talking about?
[155:30.91]It's from this.
[155:32.39]It's from this.

[156:20.68]I don't give a shit about like, oh, what if you met like Brad Pitt?
[156:23.02]What if you met like, um, I can't even think of the celebrity.

[157:03.44]She's so good at like taking a show, running a show, and being like the quarterback of the set.
[157:09.84]I'm not kidding.
[157:10.50]Seriously.

[157:26.05]Here she comes.
[157:27.70]Ready, set, go!
[157:30.56]Just like millions of you, the Express 101 is always there for me.
[157:35.07]And I can't imagine improving on what's already my most used kitchen helper.
[157:39.63]But I've heard improvement is exactly what's happened.
[157:42.87]And there's only one person in the world who's qualified to let us in on the news.
[157:46.86]So let's join my friend Cathy Mitchell and discover what's happened to the easiest cooking appliance in my home.
[157:52.42]Kathy, how are you?
[157:53.46]Great to see you too.
[157:54.79]I love my Express 101.
[157:56.43]I think you're going to love it even more now because look what we can do.
[157:59.79]Big, thick, man-sized sandwiches, beautiful frittata.
[158:03.23]She said it.
[158:04.23]Full size.
[158:05.17]And look at these.
[158:06.11]She actually said it.
[158:07.45]Even cherry.
[158:08.31]you couldn't do that before you've improved man size we've made it even more perfect come on Joe this is the express ready set go well kathy this is beautiful and it is ready look what we did we took out that center divider so now you have 25 more cooking area so you can cook a lot of different things exactly right like how about pizza it makes the best pizza I've ever had now this is my almost instant pizza dough
[158:32.78]And the recipe comes with it.
[158:33.78]All you have to do is pop it in there and then put whatever toppings you like.
[158:36.70]It's a personal pizza.
[158:37.96]So you don't have to wait for the delivery man, pay extra for all the toppings.
[158:42.01]No tip for the driver here either.
[158:43.57]Why get delivery?
[158:44.25]You can make it in the express.
[158:45.57]Ready, set, go.
[158:46.63]You'll never tell the difference except it's not so greasy.
[158:49.65]And you're saving a lot of calories.
[158:51.39]A little light mozzarella.
[158:52.79]Do you like peppers?
[158:53.75]Sure.
[158:54.19]Greasy.
[158:54.67]Throw it on.
[158:55.31]Oh, more toppings.
[158:57.03]Okay, that pizza is going to take seven minutes and we've got a built-in timer.
[159:00.44]So I just said- Only seven minutes.
[159:02.00]And it'll call me when the pizza's done.
[159:03.56]And the go part is, see the green light?
[159:05.28]That green light comes on, you know your machine is preheated and ready to start cooking.
[159:08.81]Ready, set, go.
[159:10.05]Wow, a lot of improvements here, Kathy.
[159:11.57]Seven minutes.
[159:11.87]That easy.
[159:12.09]Yeah, like practical.
[159:31.89]And this one's only going to take about five minutes.
[159:33.81]That's practical shit.
[159:34.71]So I can set that timer for five minutes, and now I don't lose track of what's cooking.
[159:37.72]Have you ever had a Hawaiian pizza?
[159:39.42]I know they exist.
[159:40.18]Okay, this is pita bread, and it tastes almost exactly like pizza crust.
[159:43.96]So you got a pita pizza.
[159:44.92]Pita pizza, that's right.
[159:45.84]I mean, I don't know about that.
[159:46.84]All you have to do is add your toppings.
[159:48.16]I don't know about that.
[159:49.12]Okay, just squish it around there.
[159:50.22]Yeah, exactly.
[159:51.10]In this case, I'm going to use Canadian bacon.
[159:53.08]Okay.
[159:53.40]But, like, using leftovers and, like, kind of making new foods from, like, leftovers.
[159:57.85]Sure.
[159:58.17]Just throw some chunks on there, yeah.
[160:00.97]You can have exactly what you want on it.
[160:02.85]Matt's going to take, again, about only five minutes because the crust is basically already cooked.
[160:06.76]This is all great, but I think all of us are really going to miss cooking those side-by-side meals you used to cook.
[160:11.98]I know, like in the Express 101.
[160:13.34]Let me show you something.
[160:15.69]Is this what you thought you were gonna miss?
[160:17.39]This is the new insertable divider pan and it goes in just like that.
[160:21.25]Wow.
[160:21.51]So they've got two machines.
[160:22.94]And it's still the world's best no-fold omelet maker.
[160:25.86]Love those omelettes.
[160:26.56]I do too.
[160:27.34]This is just two beaten eggs and I'm gonna divide it between- Look at that.
[160:30.26]We've seen so many of this shit.
[160:32.09]We've seen egg steamers, omelet in the microwave.
[160:35.27]Take a look at that.
[160:36.83]And on the other side, how about a veggie omelet?
[160:38.53]This is mushrooms and peppers and onions.
[160:40.91]I'm going to just put a little cheese on top and close that lid.
[160:44.64]And neatness doesn't count.
[160:45.66]I remember you said that.
[160:46.48]Now that's going to rise up again.
[160:47.52]It's going to rise up and in seven minutes we're going to have a perfect omelet.
[160:50.74]Cooking from top to bottom.
[160:52.34]Now, how about a weekend breakfast?
[160:53.76]How about some stuffed French toast?
[160:55.32]Oh, stuffed French toast?
[160:56.58]I've never heard of that one.
[160:57.32]Oh, it's delicious.
[160:58.07]I bought this extra thick bread.
[160:59.23]I've spread it with a little cream cheese and some strawberry jam.
[161:01.81]She knows what she's doing.
[161:03.71]It's a man-sized French toast.
[161:05.43]Just roll that sandwich in that egg batter.
[161:07.63]And in this case, now I'm using the entire cooking area of the machine.
[161:11.09]That's going to take about five minutes, so I'll just set the timer for five minutes.
[161:14.33]And how about some lunch?
[161:15.45]I'm ready.
[161:16.01]Okay, well, I'm going to make you a grilled sandwich.
[161:18.41]So I've just got a nice piece of French bread here.
[161:20.17]French bread.
[161:20.71]I'm going to put a little ham.
[161:21.90]Ham looks good.
[161:22.54]And some cheese and some tomatoes.
[161:25.44]Yep.
[161:25.70]And the top.
[161:26.34]Now, I like to brush it with just a little bit of olive oil, which is very healthy for you.
[161:30.54]And we'll pop that right in there.
[161:31.86]Hey, this is like a panini.
[161:33.78]Did you say?
[161:34.54]What did you say?
[161:35.60]And we'll pop that.
[161:37.12]What did Cathy Mitchell say?
[161:38.28]And some tomatoes and the top.
[161:40.80]Now, I like to brush it with just a little bit of olive oil, which is very healthy for you.
[161:46.16]By the way, I trust Cathy Mitchell more than, like, members of Congress.
[161:49.36]So, I mean, honest to fucking God, are you serious?
[161:54.94]And we'll pop that right in there.
[161:56.80]Hey, this is like a panini.
[161:58.12]And that'll cook in just about five minutes.
[162:00.62]So we'll set that timer.
[162:02.00]And over here, I'm going to make two sandwiches at once.
[162:05.24]That's not a high bar.
[162:06.52]Now, you like wraps?
[162:07.47]Yeah.
[162:07.85]This is pastrami, so I'm going to put a little bit of mustard on it first.
[162:11.19]Ooh, pastrami?
[162:11.49]You can use the different colored tortillas, the red and the green tortillas.
[162:13.81]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[162:14.41]And just lay that on there.
[162:15.63]Oh, yeah.
[162:16.23]That's good lean meat, too.
[162:18.37]I hope she's doing alright.
[162:19.30]You know what I mean?
[162:19.78]I hope she's, like, living a great life.
[162:22.46]All you do is fold in the sides.
[162:25.49]and roll it up now don't try to miniaturize she's actually doing this too by the way and you got a nice deep ass cheese she ain't just she ain't just putting like oh yeah like here's the thing that's already done like I well look I pretended like I was gonna make it but I didn't here it's already done look I pretended I made that look at this she's actually making this sandwich all you do is fold in the sides
[162:49.31]And roll it up.
[162:50.43]Now, don't try to miniaturize the food.
[162:52.58]Because this has got plenty of room.
[162:54.28]And you've got a nice deep well top and bottom.
[162:56.10]And it's got the hinged lid, so it'll raise up.
[162:57.84]Exactly.
[162:58.20]Now, how about a corn dog?
[162:59.18]Oh, I love corn dogs.
[163:00.12]It reminds me of being at the fair.
[163:01.52]Ah, you're just a big kid.
[163:02.48]I know that.
[163:02.86]I am.
[163:03.20]Now, just like if I was cooking this in the oven, I'd spray the pan.
[163:06.10]Mustard disappeared?
[163:06.62]I'm going to spray my big kid.
[163:08.98]What are you talking about?
[163:10.08]You know what you're talking about.
[163:11.22]You don't know what you're talking about.
[163:12.88]All you do is fold in the sides.

[165:26.23]A perfect personal pizza.
[165:27.97]That looks pretty good.
[165:28.81]I'll be honest.

[166:52.19]Hold on.

[166:55.02]A slice?

[166:58.92]About a dollar.
[167:00.80]And eat it.

[170:02.71]Wait a minute.
[170:03.23]Now, you're going to put a steak in this?
[170:05.09]I would put my ready, set, go steak up against the finest restaurant and win.
[170:09.77]Alright, now I'm just brushing... God, I hope that would be real.
[170:12.96]And we're just going to put it right in the machine.
[170:15.04]Uh-huh.
[170:15.90]And in it goes.
[170:16.48]The divider is out, so you have the full cooking area now.
[170:19.22]Okay.
[170:21.06]You like onions and mushrooms?
[170:22.30]I hear that sizzle.
[170:23.02]So let's cut up this mushroom and onion.
[170:24.58]Okay.
[170:25.99]Now let me turn this over.
[170:26.71]I want to show you how much sear we've got already on that steak.
[170:29.91]Look at that.
[170:30.39]Look at that.
[170:31.49]So this does heat up quickly.
[170:32.69]Oh, it does.
[170:33.19]Now I'm just going to go ahead and put in those mushrooms and onions.
[170:36.83]And that's going to cook to medium in about seven to eight minutes.
[170:39.81]Seven minutes?
[170:40.53]How about some unfried fried chicken?
[170:42.93]Fried chicken is so delicious and so much fat.
[170:46.21]We've got a skinless breast and some legs.
[170:48.61]And I'm going to just roll them in some crushed up cereal crumbs.
[170:51.32]Cereal crumbs?
[170:51.62]You can use any kind of cereal you want.
[170:52.80]Just crush it up real fine.
[170:53.86]Like Cap'n Crunch?
[170:54.24]Now, the only oil I'm going to use for this chicken is a little nonstick spray.
[170:57.54]No deep fat fryer?
[170:58.84]No warming the oven up?
[170:59.76]No deep fat frying.
[171:00.30]Exactly.
[171:00.88]This probably works.
[171:01.72]There's three pieces of chicken in that thing.
[171:02.92]Don't say anything yet.
[171:03.90]Guys, do you not trust Cathy Mitchell?
[171:05.30]I'm starting to see some dissent here.
[171:30.51]Excuse me?
[171:32.07]You're not going to give her at least a minute to explain what's going on here?
[171:35.02]You don't trust her?
[171:36.58]You should trust her.
[171:37.68]Like, I actually can't believe this.
[171:40.02]She had a ramen cookbook.
[171:41.41]I can't trust her.
[171:42.35]Are you serious?
[171:43.31]It's probably fantastic.
[171:46.29]Cathy Mitchell would never lead us astray.
[171:48.09]Ever.
[171:48.53]pork tenderloin medallions that I've marinated in a little teriyaki.
[171:52.35]Listen to that sizzle.
[171:54.39]Now, for a side dish for pork, I love sweet potatoes, so I've got some sweet potatoes and apple pieces mixed up together with a little bit of brown sugar.
[172:02.34]And that is gonna cook in about eight minutes.
[172:05.12]Alright.
[172:05.92]It's not like cooking in the microwave where the food comes out rubbery.
[172:09.58]It's juicy, it's warm, and in fact, being able to cook with a little bit of oil is a good, healthy habit for me and my kids.
[172:16.35]Yeah, come on!
[172:17.19]My husband watching our weight, trying to get healthy.
[172:19.75]For the working person, very fast.
[172:23.19]Just frees you up from everything.
[172:24.69]Look at that omelet!
[172:25.51]Just throw it in the dishwasher and you're done.
[172:27.84]It's got a timer on it.
[172:28.88]It tells you when to put things in.
[172:30.67]It's quick.
[172:31.65]And when you finish, you don't have to clean it up.
[172:33.98]It's great.
[172:35.16]This is the mini food pan, and it's probably my favorite because it'll just cook everything.
[172:40.21]Like, for instance, cinnamon rolls.
[172:41.51]I love to make cinnamon rolls in the morning for the kids, but who wants to heat up that big ol' oven?
[172:45.95]Oh, not bad.
[172:47.05]Get it away.
[172:47.67]Get it out of my house.
[172:48.83]So in here, I just spray it with a little nonstick.
[172:51.02]I cut each cinnamon rolls into three pieces.
[172:53.24]So now we're going to make cinny minis, and these only take four minutes.
[172:57.34]Remember, it's ready, set, four minutes to go.
[173:00.14]Okay.
[173:00.70]Now over here, I've got...
[173:01.88]Ready, set, go.
[173:02.22]Ready, set, four minutes to go.
[173:03.36]I would eat these.
[173:03.85]You could be a fully grown man, too.
[173:25.27]I don't have to be a little kid.
[173:26.15]I take a frozen tater tot, drop it into each well, and then pour some egg over it and put it in the refrigerator.
[173:30.29]Then all I have to do is get up, pop it into the ready, set, go, and I'll have eggsters.
[173:35.80]Or potatoes and eggs.
[173:37.42]Eggsters.
[173:38.60]Ready, set, go.
[173:39.30]Okay, now, how about some meatballs?
[173:41.25]I know you like meatballs.
[173:42.33]Grandma Farago's favorite.
[173:44.17]Farago.
[173:44.53]These are made special, low-cal meatballs.
[173:47.13]These are ground turkey.
[173:48.81]Oh, turkey.
[173:49.35]It's my kind of recipe.
[173:50.61]Wow, I'm healthy for you.
[173:51.89]Absolutely, and pop them right in there.
[173:54.06]Now, these are going to cook without watching, without rolling, without turning in just about eight minutes.
[173:59.52]You don't have to deep fry.
[174:00.64]When you taste them, you won't even hardly tell the difference.
[174:02.70]Look like you have a tiny arm.
[174:04.16]Yeah, as long as it's before 8 o'clock.
[174:06.86]Well, you know, hors d'oeuvres.
[174:07.91]Look at that banter.
[174:08.75]I love the banter.
[174:09.27]Stuffed mushroom?
[174:09.67]Those look good.
[174:25.41]Wow.
[174:25.55]You gotta give that a taste.
[174:42.61]Take her word for it.
[174:43.75]I'm going to cut it right down the middle because I want you to see.
[174:46.35]Look at that.
[174:47.11]That's perfect.
[174:48.45]Medium steak.
[174:49.21]Now, if you like it a little more well done, you could leave it in a little bit longer.
[174:52.10]Just catch a little.
[174:53.18]Now, it's going to be hot.
[174:54.30]Okay.
[174:54.56]Be careful.
[174:55.36]Yeah, but it's worth it.
[174:59.30]It's as good as a restaurant steak, is it not?
[175:01.21]Kathy, you met the challenge.
[175:02.87]Excellent.
[175:03.55]Excellent steak.
[175:04.43]Alright.
[175:04.71]Now, how about some chicken?
[175:06.07]There's the chicken.
[175:06.73]Fantastic.
[175:07.57]That was medium.
[175:08.55]Unfried fried chicken.
[175:09.92]That's cut the fat way down.
[175:12.04]That's a good steak.
[175:12.88]Guys, Cathy Mitchell.
[175:14.90]Cathy Mitchell got famous and popular.
[175:17.78]She became a huge streamer from this.
[175:19.77]She got really popular.
[175:21.83]Well, she played a lot of Among Us.
[175:24.21]But besides that, she was like the Minecraft stuff for a while.
[175:27.71]But she is known for doing kind of like out of the box recipes.
[175:34.35]So she would like, I know people like, what the ew, gross, like cereal.
[175:38.13]No, it's like she's like imitating recipes.
[175:40.01]She did like recipe imitations, like leftover recipes.
[175:44.08]She's not making fried chicken.
[175:46.28]She's doing, it's like her thing, right?
[175:50.68]Why is everybody minus twoing me?
[175:55.31]I'm telling you what's going on here.
[175:57.41]The Among Us joke.
[176:02.63]Okay.
[176:04.73]Okay.
[176:06.13]Oh, right.
[176:06.87]I said the words among us.
[176:08.13]I forgot.
[176:08.77]That's an automatic -2 from everybody.
[176:10.23]Okay.
[176:24.55]Isn't that delicious?
[176:25.23]This is the most delicious program I've ever worked on.
[176:26.71]Alright, I want to show you a couple of ideas over here.
[176:28.69]This is an idea you're going to love.
[176:30.39]This is my leftover box.
[176:31.99]Leftovers make great pizzas.
[176:32.75]What's in there?
[176:33.53]I'm going to make you a white pizza.
[176:35.47]For a white pizza, I'm just going to use a little ranch dressing.
[176:37.95]See?
[176:38.03]She's like the left.
[176:38.67]She does leftover stuff.
[176:39.37]Let's look in the leftover box and see what needs to get used up.
[176:41.73]Here's some broccoli.
[176:42.63]This may be the only way you eat broccoli.
[176:44.01]Broccoli, ranch.
[176:45.05]I've got some shredded chicken here.
[176:47.49]Let's add that.
[176:48.22]Mm-hmm.
[176:49.34]okay and a little bit of mozzarella cheese what get rid of these leftovers think of the money I'm saving you guys are so above this somehow why it's from pizza alright oh sounds like our minis that's probably gonna be fine
[177:03.08]Why is everybody so above that?
[177:04.16]That's very good.
[177:04.86]We use seasoning.
[177:05.30]Yeah, the chicken was... Hey.
[177:06.16]That chicken was probably already seasoned.
[177:08.33]It's leftover chicken.
[177:24.26]That was leftover chicken, leftover broccoli.
[177:25.74]It's probably already ready to go.
[177:26.76]You just have to heat it up.
[177:27.88]I mean, it's seasoned.
[177:28.94]It's been seasoned already.
[177:29.64]It's leftovers.
[177:30.35]The kids just dip them right in the syrup and eat them with their fingers.
[177:32.79]It's just a great breakfast for kids.
[177:34.97]These are the eggsters.
[177:36.11]Right, the ones I brought from the fridge.
[177:37.41]Right.
[177:37.61]We can just dump these right out onto the plate.
[177:40.38]Okay.
[177:40.70]Those are just little taters with the omelet around them kids love them.
[177:43.00]And this because it comes out will go right in the dishwasher no clean up at all.
[177:47.00]I love the ding.
[177:47.70]Now, alright this is uh... not your grandmother's meatballs.
[177:50.00]Meatballs! This I've got to try.
[177:52.00]Alright, now I'm going to give you a tiny little bite of one of them, because that's kind of cheating.
[177:57.00]And I'm going to put-
[177:58.00]So hot, this guy I feel so bad about this guy.
[178:00.00]Is that good?
[178:02.00]And remember that's turkey.
[178:03.00]So it's almost a health food.
[178:04.00]You know you make those meatballs up ahead of time when you get home-
[178:07.11]Here, it's going to be burning hot.
[178:08.63]Here, take this.
[178:09.25]It's hot.
[178:10.41]Eat this pizza.
[178:11.55]It's burning.
[178:12.33]I feel bad for this guy.
[178:14.97]And again, because I can remove that insert, I can just put my plate right on there and flip it over.
[178:20.70]And look at that.
[178:21.90]Wow.
[178:22.36]That goes back in there because, you know, if you're having a party, there's nothing worse than cold, hot hors d'oeuvres.
[178:27.38]Seriously.
[178:28.28]She gets it.
[178:30.30]Have you been holding something back from me like dessert?
[178:33.22]Well, I have some very special desserts.
[178:35.13]Come on over here and I'll show you.
[178:37.52]This first one I've got, it's kind of a giant cookie pizza.
[178:41.18]I call it a cookie pizza.
[178:43.65]Your favorite cookie dough.
[178:44.71]This happens to be oatmeal chocolate chip.
[178:46.49]Anytime you need a quick dessert, pop it right in just like this.
[178:50.05]Look at that, a cookie pizza right in the well.
[178:52.29]Right in the well in four minutes.
[178:54.77]Now, I know you love chocolate.
[178:56.89]I heard this is your dad's favorite.
[178:58.31]Dad loves this one, and he's got those little candy bars on the house.
[179:00.53]Alright, candy bar-filled cakes.
[179:02.17]There is a recipe that tells you how to take a boxed cake mix and split it into thirds.
[179:06.44]So you just fill the wells.
[179:07.52]And now on this side, I'm just going to put a little candy bar treat.
[179:09.52]Now, this is really going to be a mystery dessert because I have no idea what flavor this is.
[179:13.34]In that same chocolate cake, I've got coconut macaroons right down the middle.
[179:17.59]So close the lid.
[179:18.89]You don't know what's in there?
[179:19.63]For seven minutes.
[179:20.79]Two different kinds of desserts.
[179:22.27]Now, come on over here because I got something really special to show you.
[179:25.11]There's lots of different insert pans that'll go in here.
[179:27.65]This happens to be the full round insertable.
[179:29.96]And I like this because I use it for my world famous upside down cake.
[179:33.34]So in the bottom, I've got some butter and some brown sugar.
[179:35.72]These gross.
[179:36.26]People keep making them in commercials and I never had it.
[179:40.04]Depending on who those people are.
[179:41.48]Okay, so the pineapple rings and a little cherry in the middle of each one.
[179:44.61]I feel like I would like this.
[179:45.81]Am I like weird enough to like this?
[179:47.69]So you just fill it, pop it in there, and that's going to bake for seven minutes.
[179:52.45]They're good.
[179:52.75]It's good.
[179:53.01]They're pretty good.
[179:53.77]And you didn't have to heat up the whole oven.
[179:55.79]And that's going to save you a lot of money on energy.
[179:58.38]I love pineapple upside.
[179:59.94]It was always seen as like the jokey meme cake from like the 90s.
[180:04.46]It was such a meme that I didn't want to try it.
[180:06.34]We made this with leftovers, things you normally would have just thrown out.
[180:09.83]So it's really good for the budget.
[180:11.87]And wait until you taste it.
[180:13.92]All you guys were talking shit about this.
[180:17.06]If this was here right now in front of me, I would eat this right now and I would probably love it.
[180:22.43]Everyone was talking all this shit.
[180:23.49]I would eat this.
[180:24.73]It's just chicken, broccoli with like a nice like crispy crust, the cheese, some ranch.
[180:28.85]Like that's fine.
[180:29.69]I think it would be good.
[180:32.29]What's wrong with that?
[180:32.85]What do you mean raw?
[180:35.23]Can you hear how crunchy that is?
[180:36.83]I know you want to taste this.
[180:37.77]Yeah, I am kind of a pizza fan.
[180:38.91]Give that a try.
[180:40.89]Is that good?
[180:41.33]You know, this does not taste like leftovers.
[180:44.17]It tastes like a freshly cooked meal.
[180:46.39]So you're loving the Express Ready, Set, Go now as much as I do?
[180:49.20]I am, and I'm going to have another bite of pizza.
[180:52.20]Okay.
[180:52.40]The Express Ready, Set, Go.
[180:55.12]I want it so bad.
[180:55.92]This unique cookhold in 5,000 minutes.
[180:58.57]Delicious.
[180:59.41]And we'll deduct.
[181:02.80]Alright, let's see the end.
[181:04.73]Dude, 20 minutes just blazed by so fast.
[181:07.79]I just, I love it.
[181:08.59]I love Cathy Mitchell's so much.

[181:19.07]It's a pizza maker, it's a panini maker, a perfect omelet maker, and it's even a dessert maker, which I can't wait to try.
[181:26.11]And don't forget the new accessories, the insertable divider pan.
[181:28.73]Watch the ramen commercial, I will.
[181:30.45]And the fantastic mini food pan, which certainly puts the fun back in cooking.
[181:34.34]impressed with the controlled cooking chamber that cooks foods from the bottom and the top and it lets me fry and bake and grill all with one appliance while saving me time saving me money and hulk hogan versus Cathy Mitchell almost 70 savings in energy hulk hogan versus Cathy Mitchell grill I'm laughing I'm laughing about what you said
[182:00.77]And you know, the cookbook gives you simple step-by-step instructions and most are made in under 10 minutes.
[182:06.43]Finally, dessert.
[182:07.33]Alright, we're going to see it.
[182:08.85]Are you ready for the family cookie?
[182:10.56]I am so ready.
[182:11.42]The cookies.
[182:12.38]Alright.
[182:12.78]Now this is one.
[182:13.76]There's the cookies.
[182:14.76]But if you have a favorite cookie recipe, you can use it.
[182:16.94]Now, do you like yours?
[182:17.56]Of course.
[182:18.00]Oh, yeah.
[182:21.44]Pile of ice cream in the middle.

[182:30.06]Now this was the joyous almond cake, remember?
[182:32.40]Oh yeah, with the macaroons in the center.
[182:33.92]That really is beautiful the way it came up.
[182:36.09]Now let's see.
[182:36.67]We're going to solve the mystery of what's in the mystery cake.
[182:40.13]Oh, I think that was some caramel.
[182:42.43]Yep, great.
[182:43.19]And finally, the piece de resistance.
[182:44.89]Yes, the pineapple upside down cake.
[182:46.97]Alright, let's see it.
[182:48.13]Alright, so we're just going to turn that upside down.
[182:51.29]Bro, this looks like gas station food.
[183:20.19]So?
[183:20.43]So what?
[183:22.75]What's wrong with gas station?
[183:25.71]Some gas stations do pretty good shit.

[189:33.71]That would be a lifesaver.
[189:34.79]It's a good brownie, though.
[189:37.63]What's wrong?
[189:39.88]It's changing the taste.
[189:41.96]What?
[189:42.48]Do you want to finish the brownie?
[189:44.56]No, I really... I really don't want to.

[190:10.29]She did.
[190:10.73]That's kind of sad.
[190:14.03]This lady loves brownies.
[190:17.73]This lady loved brownies and we just ruined it for her.
[190:20.95]She like hates them now.
[190:23.93]She's treating the brownie like cigarettes.
[190:27.37]That's kind of fucked up.
[190:48.89]Mmm, it's good.
[190:49.79]Mmm, delicious cookie.
[190:50.53]Now you could probably eat that entire cookie, couldn't you?
[190:52.79]Oh yeah.
[190:53.35]Oh yeah, not a problem.
[190:54.21]No.
[190:54.53]What does it do?
[190:55.13]What is it?
[190:55.75]Three or four of them.
[190:57.23]Smell this thing.
[190:57.89]Now you don't like things you like.
[190:59.21]All you have to do is just smell it.
[191:01.31]And you won't want that cookie.
[191:02.96]Not really.
[191:04.24]Keep chewing.
[191:04.88]Keep enjoying that cookie that you love so much.
[191:06.58]You can eat three or four of those.
[191:08.12]It's alright.
[191:09.38]I couldn't even possibly eat this anymore.
[191:12.64]Somebody said there's a little piece of dog shit in the container.
[191:27.03]That's fucked up.
[191:28.45]Smell this dog shit.
[191:32.67]Do you want to eat anymore?
[191:34.69]No, actually, I don't want to eat anything.
[191:36.20]I just smell dog shit.
[191:37.54]I think I would... Hey, when was the last time you stepped in dog shit?
[191:40.90]When was the last time?
[191:42.44]You know when we talk, like the joke is like, oh man, don't step in dog shit.
[191:45.86]When was the last time you ever stepped in dog shit?
[191:50.84]I don't think it's ever happened.
[191:52.46]Like, have you ever stepped in fucking dog shit?
[191:57.32]And people talk about that, it happens.
[191:59.40]I don't think it ever happens to anybody.
[192:01.82]Happened to me a few days ago.
[192:04.90]I feel like it's been like 10 years since I've stepped in a pile of dog shit.
[192:13.75]I never am able to stick with the diet.
[192:16.62]This I could stick with, definitely.
[192:19.00]I like this stuff, it's good.
[192:20.15]Because this is making it taste differently.
[192:22.85]It's like an herbal smell.
[192:26.87]Definitely took away my desire for the sweet.
[192:30.16]Is that amazing?
[192:30.88]Amazing.
[192:32.01]Yes, amazing.
[192:32.95]You could eat this whole thing.
[192:33.91]If I gave it to you, you could consume the entire thing.
[192:35.81]That whole thing?
[192:36.39]That whole thing.
[192:37.13]Alright.
[192:38.73]Take a French fry.
[192:39.29]And eat it.

[192:50.19]Okay, please, thanks for the French fries.
[192:52.80]I bought that, I'm going to eat it.
[192:54.10]I'm not going to buy French fries, take a bite of the French fries and smell this thing and then throw the French fries away.
[193:02.93]That's weird, right?
[193:07.77]If you already buy the thing, if you bought the brownie, you're going to have inside of your head a fight here where it's like, I just bought this brownie.
[193:16.87]I want to eat the brownie.
[193:18.98]Why did I buy the brownie?
[193:20.04]No, I'm going to eat the brownie.

[193:36.86]That's like, I don't know, that's like kind of sad.

[205:09.29]I'm out of here.
[205:12.56]How about the, uh... The Easy Yolk!
[205:20.39]The Easy Yolk sounds good.
[205:21.41]So do you know egg whites have only 15 calories, are high in protein, and are virtually fat and cholesterol free?
[205:27.38]But separating the egg yolk from the white is a real pain.
[205:30.78]Until now.
[205:31.90]Introducing Easy Yolk, the world's easiest egg yolk separator.
[205:38.81]Easy yolk separates the yolk in seconds.
[205:41.03]Huh?
[205:42.43]What do you do with it?
[205:45.02]We all know egg whites are healthier, but are they worth the hassle?
[205:47.90]No, fuck this propaganda.
[205:50.08]Fuck this propaganda.
[205:51.22]I'm taking a stand right now.
[205:54.12]Egg yolks are good for you.
[205:55.41]It's what all the vitamins, all the fucking fats.
[205:58.69]Oh, but Jeremy, there's cholesterol.
[206:01.41]Oh my fucking God, that's where everything is.
[206:03.83]Yolks are where all the good shit is.
[206:06.64]Oh no, cholesterol!
[206:07.82]Oh no!
[206:09.42]Shut up!
[206:12.21]Shut up!
[206:16.73]Eggs are good.
[206:17.71]Eat eggs.
[206:18.23]They're good.
[206:18.67]Just don't eat a fucking hundred of them.
[206:20.30]Don't eat a hundred eggs a week.
[206:23.24]This whole, this, this, this, this, don't eat the egg shit.
[206:26.08]Don't eat the yolks, only eat the egg whites.
[206:28.94]No, man, that's where all the good stuff is in the yolk.
[206:31.08]Pancakes and waffles, omelets and soufflés, french toast and homemade muffins, even breakfast burritos can all be made with egg whites.
[206:38.47]And if you like to bake... And look, I understand, egg whites are great.
[206:41.71]If you want to do like an egg white omelet, somebody said egg white omelets are good.
[206:44.75]Yeah, they are.
[206:46.39]If you want to have an egg white omelet...
[206:50.08]But, like, people that, like, oh, no, take the yolk and fucking throw it away.
[206:54.47]No, no, if...
[206:57.09]Why get rid of it?
[206:58.83]If you want to specifically have like, oh, you know, today I feel like I want to feel like a little lighter.
[207:01.77]I'm gonna do an egg white almond.
[207:03.39]Alright, cool.
[207:04.29]I'm sure it's delicious.
[207:05.19]It is.
[207:06.35]The super frog sound effects in here.
[207:07.92]You'll love Easy Yolk.
[207:09.18]It's easy to master meringues or heavenly angel food cake.
[207:12.50]You'll wonder how you ever lived without the Easy Yolk.
[207:15.42]Watch us separate the yolks with Easy Yolk while only one yolk is removed the old-fashioned way.
[207:23.56]That is super prog.
[207:24.94]The Easy Yolk's patent-pending design pulls egg yolks quickly and easily.
[207:29.34]With one squeeze, the egg yolk is sucked up the perfectly sized sleeve and deposited into the bowl.
[207:34.72]Okay, listen.
[207:36.04]I know that there are a lot of people that have dietary restrictions.
[207:38.73]Maybe you do have really high cholesterol and you need to take it down.
[207:42.45]I get it.
[207:43.47]But if you just have a regular diet and you're a healthy individual and you're not trying to go on a diet or anything, the yolk is fine.
[207:51.33]This did not get stopped.
[207:59.33]Alright, one more, one more, and then I gotta go.
[208:01.13]Should we end it on dump cakes?
[208:11.55]You love delicious homemade desserts, but recipes can be complicated and take so long to make.
[208:16.68]Hi, Cathy Mitchell here with my new dump cake cookbook.
[208:20.08]Forget measuring.

[208:29.17]I don't even care.
[208:29.69]Watch this.
[208:30.47]Start with fruit.
[208:31.59]Dump on your favorite cake mix.
[208:33.37]And finish with a can of soda.
[208:35.03]Or you can use diet for a guilt-free dessert.
[208:37.19]Then just bake it in the oven for a delicious Raz and Peach dump cake.
[208:41.28]Oh, so scrumptious.
[208:42.34]What's wrong with this?
[208:42.90]Look, your kids will devour this s'mores chocolate cake.

[208:47.72]Here's the cake, Mick.

[208:54.37]That looks good.
[208:55.15]Best dessert ever.
[208:56.51]Now here's one of my favorites.
[208:58.13]Just dump syrup, sugar, cinnamon, and nuts in a pan.
[209:01.69]And then just layer in some biscuits.
[209:03.61]For fresh, warm, sticky buns.
[209:05.91]Just like grandma used to make.
[209:07.73]It really is mistake-proof.
[209:09.02]You just dump and bake.
[209:10.40]I never knew homemade desserts could be this easy.
[209:12.64]You don't need to spend hours to make homemade cakes.
[209:15.62]Get my dump cake cookbook today.
[209:17.18]Wait, did she... Did that kid just hit...
[209:19.89]The kid just, like, punched Mom.
[209:20.73]We already saw that one.
[209:45.60]One more.
[209:46.28]This is it.
[209:46.83]Last one.
[209:47.31]This is KNN, the Kids News Network.
[209:50.68]Good morning, I'm Chucky Stewart.
[209:53.02]Today's top story is this the end of the sandwich as we know it.
[209:57.46]Most of us expect a sandwich to be plain, square, possibly with a crust cut off.
[210:02.81]But Susie Brady reports that this is changing.
[210:06.17]Thanks, Chucky.
[210:06.97]I'm here outside Swatston Elementary where a new trend is invading lunchboxes.
[210:11.01]They're called Samet Shapers.
[210:12.41]Is this a school project?
[210:13.75]Moms and kids cut their usual sandwiches into some very unusual shapes.
[210:17.85]Like this spiral, this fish, or even this rabbit in a hat.
[210:21.78]Brian is so finicky.
[210:22.84]Wait a minute.
[210:23.22]But when I started using sandwich shapers, well, you can see how he gobbles it right up.
[210:27.62]Brian's mom was the first to try sandwich shapers, but it wasn't long before every kid at Swats and was begging for these new lunchtime treats.
[210:33.84]Oh, look, I got the butterfly.
[210:35.32]Pretty.
[210:36.24]I got the donut.
[210:37.56]Awesome.
[210:38.38]But not everyone's thrilled with the change.
[210:40.78]It's hard on the kids who can't get these sandwich shapers.
[210:44.22]Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my lunch.
[210:47.55]A bear?
[210:48.45]Cool!
[210:51.89]Why do I feel like that's, like, gonna be fucking me in 30 years?
[210:55.21]Back to you, Chucky.
[210:56.53]Excuse me, I have to get back to my lunch.
[210:58.41]A bear?
[210:58.67]Cool!
[211:12.64]Back to you, Chucky.
[211:13.62]Hope that guy's doing good.
[211:15.02]Thanks, Susie.
[211:16.02]And we'll have more after this commercial break.
[211:20.13]Sammich Shapers are a cool new way to turn ordinary sandwiches into extraordinary lunchtime treats.
[211:25.58]Pull a rabbit out of a hat, then eat them both.
[211:28.24]Let your butterfly fly free before it ends up in your stomach.
[211:31.96]Or just have fun with a PB&J.
[211:33.88]You get to eat the donut and the whole.
[211:36.44]Hate the crust?
[211:37.40]No problem.
[211:38.22]With Sammich Shapers, mom... I mean, I would say... I mean, if you're only gonna eat this one, like, big part of the sandwich, that's kind of... It's just a tiny sandwich.
[211:50.95]I think, like, okay, you eat this whole thing, and there's a cool imprint, right?
[211:53.91]Yeah.
[211:54.05]I mean, if you're only gonna eat the bunny rabbit part, that's...
[212:09.03]I mean, at what point is it like, I'm going to make a sandwich and throw half of it away so I can have the bunny shape?
[212:17.55]Anything you'd want to, like, slowly introduce to the kids?
[212:22.79]Like, hey, we're going to start to eat.
[212:24.97]Is that like a sandwich?
[212:26.72]You're not just going to eat the bunny ears?
[212:29.26]And not, like, throw half the sandwich away?
[212:32.04]It's a bonus.
[212:32.80]Just pay separate processing.
[212:34.02]I mean, that's a waste of money, right?
[212:37.75]Apparently, here's how you order.
[212:39.93]$11.
[212:40.03]Alright, one more.
[212:44.35]One more.
[212:45.25]Whatever we get.
[212:46.57]Okay, whatever we get.
[212:47.19]We're going to let the algorithm take it.
[212:49.21]Let the algorithm take it.
[212:50.02]Whatever it is.
[212:53.70]Perfect pie cutter.
[212:55.38]tired of serving your pie like this you bake the perfect pie but it crumbles apart when you serve it you carefully cut your pie but the slices end up uneven you cover your pie to keep it fresh but the topping comes off now there's a solution introducing the perfect pie cutter the same pie cutter used by hundreds of top rest what is this
[213:26.11]What?
[213:29.05]What?
[213:32.39]Hey, Jerma, since you've been watching infomercials, I thought I could recommend one that's pretty entertaining.
[213:36.61]When I was about 10 years old, I got cast as Chucky Stewart in an infomercial advertising a product called Sandwich Shapers.
[213:45.39]It cuts the crust off your sandwich and also turns it like an animal or a fun shape.
[213:50.07]I got the audition for it through a talent agency.
[213:53.91]I later found out the commercial had gone national and nobody told me.
[213:59.21]Are you shitting me, dude?
[214:01.65]You were Chucky Stewart?
[214:06.24]I did not see that over here in Mod Chat.
[214:09.72]I promise.
[214:13.22]I just played that.
[214:14.38]I didn't even know that was here.
[214:15.36]Really?
[214:17.99]Really?
[214:21.62]A viewer here was that kid.
[214:30.49]I don't know if that's fake.
[214:31.59]I think that's real.
[214:33.31]Is this real or is this a bit?
[214:35.39]No, it's real.
[214:37.34]That's apparently real.
[214:38.44]International star.
[214:40.08]That's fucking insane.
[214:41.84]That's insane.
[214:42.82]Ban him.
[214:43.26]Hold on a minute.
[215:03.97]Guys, I want to make sure that we make this, you know, all the facts here.
[215:09.76]The mods are telling me that was posted yesterday in the Discord.
[215:15.90]That was posted yesterday.
[215:19.64]I did not see that.
[215:21.18]So this is for real.
[215:22.96]This person's not jumping on the sandwich shaper bandwagon here just because it was on camera.
[215:27.70]That was in the Discord yesterday.
[215:32.48]Wow.
[215:33.30]Actually real.
[215:35.22]Yeah.
[215:37.86]Yeah, this is posted yesterday in the Discord.
[215:42.72]You can have the same secret used in restaurants in your own home.
[215:46.52]What the fuck?
[215:47.46]Now I can have that look at home with my friends and family.
[215:51.62]And I'm just like, how do you make everything look so fancy?
[215:54.60]That's Chucky Stewart?
[215:55.74]And it's the perfect pie cutter.
[215:57.34]I love this shit so much.
[215:59.34]The leftover pie running and drying up?
[216:01.72]Well, not anymore.
[216:02.82]Leave the perfect pie cutter.
[216:05.32]actually ban him, though.
[216:06.52]I'm not going to ban the kid.
[216:10.04]I'm not going to ban the kid anymore.
[216:15.06]Chucky Stewart is like 40 right now.
[216:16.98]I don't know why.
[216:18.88]I'm just imagining, like, oh, ban him.
[216:20.42]It'd be funny.
[216:21.10]I'm like, I'm not going to ban a 10-year-old.
[216:28.38]Chucky Stewart is like 30 or 40 years old.
[216:33.33]Actually, I would probably ban a 10-year-old.
[216:35.73]You're not fucking allowed to be here.
[216:36.69]That's so cool, though.
[216:51.39]the perfect pie cutter comes with a specially designed spatula that fits perfectly between the blades so you can serve perfect slices every time the perfect pie cutter is durable and dishwasher safe get ready for the holidays or any special alright I'm done I've had enough I'll see you guys later ah that's gonna conclude the stream gonna be it was a quick one today yeah I know
[217:19.90]He actually could be closer to 60.
[217:21.86]No, he would absolutely not.
[217:23.34]That commercial was like 1998 or 2000 or something.
[217:25.58]2001.
[217:25.60]2002.
[217:25.92]Yeah, that's it.
[217:26.62]When's the next stream?
[217:27.24]Let's see.
[217:28.14]Today's Tuesday.
[217:32.70]We could do...
[217:49.37]Maybe we'll... Maybe this weekend?
[217:54.07]Saturday, Sunday?
[217:59.33]Well, I'm thinking Saturday, Sunday.
[218:03.97]On the weekend.
[218:11.65]I think that works.
[218:14.81]This was 2013.
[218:15.33]So, okay.
[218:17.41]So that would be
[218:20.29]Alright, so... Yeah.
[218:26.77]So, if... If Chucky Stewart was... Maybe, like, 20?
[218:32.80]23?
[218:32.82]24?
[218:32.92]Early 20s?
[218:39.00]That's so funny.
[218:40.90]That's such an insane happenstance.
[218:44.04]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[218:45.14]Thanks for watching.
[218:46.85]That was in commercials.
[218:48.11]Whoops.
[218:49.91]That's better.
[218:56.57]Take care of yourselves.
[218:57.15]See you this weekend, Saturday and Sunday.
[218:58.91]I actually don't have a plan.
[219:01.47]By the way, that's not the last time you're going to see infomercials.
[219:04.29]I think we have way too much fun with these.
[219:07.06]That.
[219:08.74]I mean, there are literally thousands and thousands of infomercials.
[219:16.78]There's plenty.
[219:25.38]We should probably take a little bit of a break.
[219:27.76]Maybe not for a few streams you won't see it.
[219:34.05]Just because I don't want to, you know, I want it to be fun.
[219:36.69]Fun and special.
[219:37.45]I don't want to just have it, just do it every day.
[219:51.42]Take care.
[219:51.78]Yeah, take care.
[219:55.01]Alright, let's take a look real quick.
[220:05.74]Let's do a raid.
[220:06.72]I want to raid.
[220:07.86]I want to raid.
[220:15.22]I want to raid.
[220:30.23]Stirr is live, and Vinny's live.
[220:31.97]There's a bunch of people live right now.
[220:36.95]I never catch Stirr live.
[220:42.22]But Stirr, I mean, his thing, dump... Opening up the dump cake and pour... Be good, be nice if you're gonna hang out with Stirr's chat.
[220:51.64]He's gonna be very furious with me.
[220:56.78]Stirr's gonna be upset with me that I did this.
[220:59.44]So...
[221:08.32]Be nice.
[221:08.67]Guess I had a Ster.
[221:10.55]Playing Rogue Legacy 2.
[221:13.35]If you don't know who Ster is, there's a lot of new viewers here.
[221:15.79]Let me just explain.
[221:16.49]If you didn't remember, if you don't catch it, or if you can't.
[221:19.19]Oh, who's that?
[221:20.69]Ster was in the replacement stream.
[221:23.95]Obviously, he's one of the judges.
[221:25.82]Very funny guy.
[221:26.28]I've known him a long time.
[221:33.84]Just went offline.
[221:36.06]But... Wait, because I was talking about it?
[221:40.84]No, he didn't.
[221:43.40]If he did that, that's really funny.
[221:45.77]Okay, I'm gonna cancel that.
[221:49.83]Um... Okay, so...
[222:07.51]Alright, so there's a few other people we could raid.
[222:11.15]You know, let's, you know, I haven't raided, you know, I want to, let's go, let's go say hi to BoxBox.

[222:22.29]What are you up to?
[222:26.13]Training in Valorant.
[222:38.19]Valorant training.
[222:40.09]Yeah, BoxBox is awesome.
[222:44.55]I got to, uh, spend a little time at the stream rewards with BoxBox.
[222:51.72]Really, really, really swell, swell person.
[223:01.76]Valorant?
[223:04.88]He didn't end because of you, he was on an eight and a half hour stream.
