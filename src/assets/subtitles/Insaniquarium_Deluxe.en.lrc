[ve:60.16.100]

[00:45.13]Good evening, everybody.
[00:46.03]How are we?
[00:50.01]Are we good?
[00:52.03]Good.
[00:54.62]Yeah, we're like 30 minutes early.
[01:00.56]I'm, uh... I'm okay.
[01:04.11]Not gonna lie, I've been in better shape before, but...
[01:09.21]You know what they say when you're behind the scenes at a play.
[01:14.93]And they say, you know, you go break a leg, the show must go on.
[01:20.01]That's, you know, that's figurative E. Figurative E. Yeah, that's figurative E and literary E. Both those things.
[01:28.42]I no longer can say L's.
[01:30.32]That's my illness.
[01:31.96]Figurative E and literary E. If you got an L-Y today...
[01:38.84]Uh-uh.
[01:42.60]Ah, that hurts.
[01:48.15]No, how are you guys doing?
[01:51.31]His illness.
[01:56.71]What, you have chicken burning in the oven?
[01:59.51]What are you thinking?
[02:01.91]Make sure you cook that chicken first!
[02:03.49]Don't worry, we're just gonna hang out here for a minute anyways.
[02:10.10]But, no, I'm not feeling well.
[02:12.65]And it's not that I... I don't have a cold.
[02:15.67]I have colitis.
[02:17.09]As most of us here already know.
[02:20.29]It's kind of been a pain in the ass the last few days.
[02:24.05]Do I like pineapple on pizza?
[02:26.93]Um...
[02:29.19]I'm not one of those people that will tell you not to put it on.
[02:33.86]But, okay, so if you had a pizza in front of us, and there was some bacon and some ham on it or something, and somebody walked by with pineapples and started to, like, oh, hey, like, reaching for it, like, I'm going to put these on here.
[02:43.14]I'd be like, I don't, and then they'd put it on there, and I'd be like, oh, no, I like it.
[02:47.20]I like that.
[02:47.60]It's good.
[02:48.58]And I would eat it, and I would be like, okay.
[02:53.31]It's not my first choice.
[02:59.48]Pineapple on pizza.
[03:00.42]First opinion that isn't wrong.
[03:02.14]What are you talking about?
[03:03.05]I have lots of right opinions.
[03:05.23]Don't you know that's how opinions work?
[03:07.59]They're either correct.
[03:09.37]They're either right or wrong.
[03:12.01]Opinions aren't just opinions.
[03:13.37]They have to be completely right or completely wrong opinions.
[03:20.40]Am I going to play more play with me?
[03:22.92]No.
[03:23.16]Not until that guy comes out with his third YouTube video.
[03:26.39]Or fourth YouTube video.
[03:29.35]But this stream is not going to be very long.
[03:33.35]I'm sort of having trouble now.
[03:37.76]But I did want to get something up.
[03:38.90]I wanted just to hang out for a couple hours because I've only streamed one time this week.
[03:44.38]I really would like to at least do something.
[03:48.96]Tomorrow night is going to be probably, potentially an Etalyx Friend stream.
[03:56.14]There's a few co-op games that we could get our hands on
[04:01.12]but might not last that long.
[04:04.09]So what we're gonna do is we're gonna play a childhood favorite game of mine.
[04:07.59]And by childhood, I mean like nine years ago, so I wasn't necessarily a child.
[04:13.26]But let me get it open here so you can see what it is.
[04:15.50]It's probably gonna be loud as hell.
[04:18.70]It's probably gonna be loud as hell.
[04:20.04]Let's just move that over here.
[04:23.10]Let's go to my Steam.
[04:28.99]And there it is.
[04:29.64]It's a sane aquarium.
[04:31.08]I can't, why can I not say consonants?
[04:34.94]A sane aquarium?
[04:36.90]I'm having problems.
[04:40.38]Hey, thank you to Cranford, Cranford G. Thank you for the $50.
[04:47.25]Let's get this open.
[04:49.77]Thank you so much, dude.
[04:50.49]Let's see what you... Ah, that's loud.
[04:53.31]That's loud.
[04:54.42]Not loud for you, but it's loud for me.
[04:55.70]Let's fix that.
[05:00.96]Music get out of here sound effects get out of here That's okay There we are I know this is I have trouble being able to hold on Okay So we're gonna play this There it is let me get that over here that's over there, okay Thank You Cranford.
[05:23.13]Sorry.
[05:23.43]You're not feeling 100% love you dad.
[05:24.41]Thank you be the $50 Cranford gee
[05:30.10]Can you see it on the screen?
[05:31.82]Now you can.
[05:33.50]And I know I will fix it, don't worry.
[05:36.58]Let's go ahead and make that full screen with hardware acceleration.
[05:43.41]What happened to the meme funeral?
[05:44.65]The meme funeral still has to happen, it's just the last week I've been having problems.
[05:49.77]So... I can't... I didn't have the opportunity to do exactly what I wanted to do.
[05:56.24]Which was set up a little thing here for the meme funeral.
[05:59.66]It's still gonna happen, don't worry.
[06:03.16]What happened to Aquaman?
[06:06.88]Aquaman... What do you mean, what happened to Aquaman?
[06:13.18]Oh yeah, my name is The Champion.
[06:18.18]So if you've never played this game before, let me go over a couple of things with you.
[06:22.82]This game is one of the most addicting games I've ever played.
[06:26.09]I have played this game dozens and dozens upon hundreds of times.
[06:29.97]Each time I get super addicted.
[06:32.11]I can't stop playing it.
[06:33.75]I get totally, totally infatuated and addicted.
[06:38.50]The challenge modes, I'm going to tell you, they're impossible.
[06:41.23]They're not possible to complete.
[06:43.53]Like, three of them are.
[06:46.19]You get your virtual tank, you collect shells, you get little mascots, you get little buddies.
[06:50.61]This game's amazing.
[06:51.57]So we're going to start our adventure.
[06:52.93]Let's talk about what you do here, because this is just a relaxed stream.
[06:55.69]I'm going to wait until most people get here and most people trickle in.
[06:58.97]Because I might just shit my pants on camera.
[07:04.77]There's a possibility.
[07:09.11]So you have fish in your tank that you feed.
[07:11.58]You have to buy food.
[07:14.04]You also have to watch out for aliens.
[07:16.26]Because when aliens come, they try to kill all your fish and you gotta zap them with a mouse.
[07:20.78]And if you collect three pieces of the egg, you get to advance the level.
[07:24.87]Play on the hardest difficulty.
[07:26.91]The game just gets harder as we go.
[07:28.09]So are you ready?
[07:31.57]Here we are.
[07:32.09]Welcome to Insane Aquarium.
[07:34.79]If you don't feed your fish in time, they die.
[07:38.13]They turn green, and they puke and die.
[07:41.55]It's got one of the greatest soundtracks ever devised.
[07:45.55]This is by, I believe it's Yoko Shimomura, did the soundtrack for this game.
[07:50.50]And it really is a timeless piece.
[07:52.94]In fact, let's get a little bit higher.
[07:55.70]Yeah, it was, uh, Yoko Shimomura and, uh, and John, what's his name?
[08:00.64]Hans, Hans Williams?
[08:02.14]What's the guy's name?
[08:02.76]The guy that did Star Wars.
[08:05.77]Oh, shit, they're both dying.
[08:07.84]No, I'm a pro at this game.
[08:08.98]I can't already fuck it up.
[08:14.78]So, yeah, this is how it works.
[08:16.80]This is pretty much the game.
[08:18.48]But it gets crazy, because you see, I have $160.
[08:20.10]Let's turn, like, hold on, let me use it here.
[08:25.42]It's a hundred bucks to buy a fish.
[08:28.80]And they, this is what happens.
[08:30.64]They shut out money.
[08:33.82]You collect money, you make more fish, you feed more people.
[08:38.24]You don't think this is the whole game.
[08:40.06]Why am I playing this?
[08:43.50]Because I'm sick, and I can't do anything else.
[08:46.63]This is the only thing I can do right now.
[08:49.03]Is play Insane Aquarium.
[08:56.70]What is this mobile game?
[08:57.91]Dude, this is not a mobile game.
[08:59.21]This is one of the best games ever.
[09:01.25]This is PopCap.
[09:02.07]This is original PopCap.
[09:02.99]This is before Plants vs. Zombies.
[09:06.91]Plants vs. Zombies wished they were this game.
[09:16.06]The guys that made Plants vs. Zombies, this was their original code.
[09:20.72]This is the Walt Disney.
[09:22.76]The Walt Disney World of PopCap games.
[09:26.98]Uh-huh.
[09:32.35]This is before it used to cost real money to buy these.
[09:34.87]This is just the tutorial level.
[09:39.45]You'll see how crazy this game gets.
[09:41.01]Why are you fish-shitting money?
[09:45.62]Because that's what happens.
[09:46.62]Eventually the whole screen gets covered.
[09:52.59]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[09:55.83]Eventually they get huge and they start shooting out better dollars.
[09:59.71]There's eight fish on the screen.
[10:00.91]Just wait till there's like 30.
[10:02.00]You just have to pay for the egg and then they're done.
[10:09.88]That's crazy, ResidentSleeper.
[10:12.81]This is a classic game.
[10:18.78]Come on, come on!
[10:19.44]Guys that don't know what this game is, this is a great video game.
[10:25.89]This game took me a week to beat.
[10:27.45]Yeah, I know.
[10:29.23]See, there's like 20 different characters that you unlock.
[10:32.97]This is Stinky the Snail.
[10:36.26]Stinky roams around the bottom of your tank, catching any coins you may have missed.
[10:40.74]Now, there he is, see?
[10:41.82]And you get to choose.
[10:42.46]You get up to three of these guys in the tank.
[10:45.64]Incoming horror game no, I told you listen to me listen Don't you know that the person that made this song the person admit I gotta calm down here because I'm getting a little upset and I'm supposed to be relaxing Because I have a little bit of a stomach issue right now You're gonna you're gonna seriously disrespect the person that made the Final Fantasy fucking 17 soundtrack Mario RPG Kingdom Hearts
[11:14.48]You're going to disrespect that person?
[11:17.32]Listen to this.
[11:23.83]That tears me up when I start hearing this.
[11:28.53]I just get sad.
[11:30.47]It's just such joyous music.
[11:37.14]Anyways, I think I gotta calm down.
[11:38.32]This is supposed to be a stream where I just sit here and talk to you guys and relax.
[11:42.10]This is gonna be a glorified Q&A stream.
[11:45.41]Oh, this turns the fucking shitty music off.
[11:48.05]Let's just like feed fish and talk.
[11:50.17]Fucking worst soundtrack I've ever heard.
[11:55.54]Play the relaxing horror game you played a few days ago.
[11:57.72]No, we're playing Insane Aquarium.
[11:59.44]We're gonna read bits, we're gonna hang out.
[12:04.67]I haven't read any so far.
[12:12.65]Insane!
[12:13.79]Oh, here we go!
[12:14.49]Danger!
[12:15.01]A vicious alien is about to enter your tank.
[12:17.15]Defeat it with your laser weapon by clicking on it.
[12:20.96]Let's turn the music back on for this.
[12:23.80]Okay, see, listen.
[12:29.23]Asking for money.
[12:30.17]No, shit.
[12:30.91]That's not... This is supposed to be... I'm just drinking... Just watch this.
[12:35.33]Watch how fast I can beat this alien.
[12:36.93]It's just how fast you click the button.
[12:39.45]Ready?
[12:39.83]He appears anywhere on the screen.
[12:40.79]It could be anywhere.
[12:44.77]That's why I have a fucking champion.
[12:52.11]That's why they call me the champion of this game.
[12:55.96]I'm just... I'm just purely untouchable.
[12:59.94]Eventually you can upgrade your food, you can start to give him drugs.
[13:03.48]See?
[13:03.64]Oh, this is what we're doing today.
[13:09.22]Alright, I feel strange bits.
[13:11.70]So, um... This game is dumb.
[13:14.74]Don't... How dare you say that.
[13:17.01]Don't say that.
[13:19.05]This is... This game is so much fun.
[13:22.72]And I saw that it's on Steam.
[13:24.04]You have to play it on Steam.
[13:25.88]Now I got extra food.
[13:28.52]Now they get hungry less often, which means you get more time to collect.
[13:32.24]You don't have to spend as much money, because it costs money to put the food down.
[13:35.57]Just wait till another alien comes, and I can fucking impress you.
[13:44.93]Why am I playing a Newgrounds game?
[13:47.99]This is not a Newgrounds game.
[13:49.19]This is like before Newgrounds.
[13:50.63]No, that's not true.
[13:52.37]This is kind of at the same time, there's a difference.
[13:57.33]Now I can drop two pieces of food at the same time.
[13:59.89]Battle tip, shoot the alien's head.
[14:02.75]Okay, here we go.
[14:03.83]We got another PogChamp moment here.
[14:07.92]Check this out.
[14:10.92]Finally some good fucking food.
[14:19.98]Buy the first egg piece.
[14:24.55]Even when I'm sick, I can still do it.
[14:31.65]I still got it.
[14:33.27]Okay, let's like read some- oh god.
[14:38.06]Another egg piece.
[14:41.08]I can play Stanley Parable?
[14:45.86]No, I'm playing Insane Aquarium!
[14:49.70]I'm playing Insane Aquarium tonight!
[14:53.93]This is what you get.
[14:54.57]This is what you get tonight.
[14:57.35]Nothing else.
[14:59.03]Look at that, it's a funny face.
[15:06.86]I gotta calm down.
[15:13.98]I want a refund.
[15:16.88]No, no, there's no refunds.
[15:19.48]Just wait, see, but this one does.
[15:22.02]Every so often.
[15:22.96]Look, eventually, you guys, you kids like upgrades, right?
[15:26.88]You kids like fucking upgrades.
[15:29.46]Eventually there's gonna be like 30 of these animals I can choose from.
[15:35.25]And they all have their own pros and cons.
[15:38.61]Just wait till I unlock the shark, you'll think he's the coolest thing ever.
[15:43.89]See, something that you kids don't understand is when I was your age, we cared about animals.
[15:52.40]One of the reasons why this is one of my fav- Look at that!
[15:55.70]$300!
[15:55.72]There's a reason- There's a reason why you- I have so much trouble these days with that.
[16:04.01]You don't like animals?
[16:04.79]Is that the problem?
[16:12.04]Wasn't I supposed to be reading bits?
[16:14.28]Oh yeah, I read.
[16:17.53]See, I love looking over here in the chat and seeing some of the new skins, right?
[16:23.34]Look, we got it.
[16:23.94]And look, this is where gameplay evolves, okay?
[16:27.48]Levolution, as Todd Howard said, whatever his name was.
[16:30.98]Tom Hardy, the guy that, whatever, who's the guy that made Oblivion?
[16:34.29]Levolution.
[16:36.13]Hold on, we got an alien incoming.
[16:38.53]Levolution, you have to feed, hold on a minute, let me take care of this first.
[16:52.11]So, these guys, you make one of these, and they eat the regular fish.
[16:57.45]Big fish eats the little fish, so you have to keep supplying this.
[17:00.45]I can't feed this guy with the regular food pellets.
[17:02.74]It doesn't work.
[17:06.96]Nice miss, casual.
[17:08.60]Wow.
[17:10.46]If you have speed, then it doesn't matter.
[17:14.27]As long as it blotches.
[17:14.83]Ready?
[17:15.01]Bingo.
[17:15.55]Carnivore.
[17:16.09]They eat these fish.
[17:17.57]You gotta supply them with their own food source.
[17:19.69]This is where it gets really bloody.
[17:21.67]You skids will love this.
[17:23.43]Just murder.
[17:24.03]Yeah, you skids love murder these days, don't you?
[17:28.60]If there's no blood, if there's nobody getting, like, ran over.
[17:31.52]Yeah, yeah.
[17:32.58]Check out that, you skids!
[17:34.78]And he drops down diamonds.
[17:44.71]We gotta get to 2,000.
[17:46.57]You can upgrade your laser weapon to do more damage against the aliens.
[17:50.79]Oh shit, it's gonna die.
[17:53.91]Come on, eat him.
[17:54.43]Eat him!
[17:55.24]Eat him!
[17:55.72]Come on!
[17:56.78]Nice.
[17:57.08]Let's go ahead and do... Let's get another one of these guys.
[18:04.50]We got an enemy approaching.
[18:05.32]I gotta be careful.
[18:06.01]I don't want to lose anybody.
[18:15.06]By the way, if those guys touch any fish, they die.
[18:17.72]They just get instantly deleted.
[18:19.60]Alright, we gotta get some good, uh... The diamonds, obviously, are worth more money.
[18:25.61]Loud?
[18:25.99]Is that why it's gonna look green?
[18:30.11]Is it loud?
[18:31.29]What's loud?
[18:34.27]Hey, everybody talked a bunch of shit about this game, and now they're realizing that this is like, holy shit, this is fucking kinda cool.
[18:41.70]I haven't even read any of this, and that's a good thing I said I was going to do the most.
[18:47.29]It's too quiet.
[18:51.35]Dude, some of the stuff in this game is so much fun, eventually you'll start seeing like hundreds of diamonds on the screen at the same time, and you gotta have the speed and the dexterity like I have to be able to collect it.
[19:00.12]Just wait till we beat this whole game on screen.
[19:03.96]No one thinks this is cool.
[19:06.08]I highly, I highly doubt that it's reality.
[19:12.03]Gotta give it a chance.
[19:17.07]When am I gonna... Hold on, they got... Wait a minute, hold on.
[19:19.87]I gotta... There are like hundreds of dollars coming in right now.
[19:24.57]Almost to the end.
[19:26.95]Let's like take a second here.
[19:28.25]There we go.
[19:30.35]Alright, we got our third mascot.
[19:34.17]And it is Itchy the Swordfish.
[19:36.25]Itchy helps you by attacking aliens when they appear.
[19:38.95]So Itchy actually helps you fight aliens.
[19:42.42]So let's just hang out here.
[19:43.24]We're on tank 1-4.
[19:44.06]I just want to make sure I can do this.
[19:46.63]Alright, let's read some of these bits here.
[19:49.53]Thank you to Ewert Wedgie Wirty Twirty for the $100, dude.
[19:56.17]Stanley Parable of Papers, please.
[19:59.18]First of all, thank you so much for the 100 bucks, but dude, you do not want to watch me play Papers, Please.
[20:05.75]Absolutely not.
[20:07.51]I have so much trouble paying attention on stream.
[20:11.61]You think I'm gonna be able to pay attention to that shit?
[20:13.97]I've beaten that game before, and I had to be in a dark fucking room, silent, with my iPad, to even do the first 10 levels of that game.
[20:22.88]There's no way I'll be able to speak.
[20:24.62]It'll be a silent stream.
[20:27.69]No, no, I'm not gonna play.
[20:30.09]That's not gonna happen.
[20:32.66]We're gonna play this game!
[20:36.54]Don't leave- I'm not gonna leave this game.
[20:38.06]I told you this is what we're doing tonight.
[20:40.94]I don't have the mental or physical fortitude to do anything else but feed fish.
[20:44.89]I've been dealing with my fucking dumbass disease the last three days.
[20:48.13]The last three fucking days!
[20:51.12]It sucks!
[20:52.56]Sorry, I'm fine.
[20:53.20]Don't worry about me.
[20:54.30]But thank you, uh, E-word, Twerky, T-word.
[20:56.66]For the 100 bucks, dude.
[20:58.14]Also, thank you to Kabutsu for the 10 bucks.
[21:00.16]Yo, this is a game that's my favorite as a child.
[21:02.47]See?
[21:03.81]It's a great game.
[21:05.93]It's one of the best.
[21:06.41]Thank you for the 10 bucks, dude.
[21:07.35]Thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the 15 dollars.
[21:09.71]Coin upgrade that makes Jerma play better games.
[21:12.42]Love you.
[21:12.92]That's not gonna happen.
[21:13.64]We're gonna play this.
[21:14.32]This already is a better game.
[21:17.05]Also, thank you to Tingy for the $1.
[21:18.75]Can't play Papers, Please and talk at the same time and you call yourself a gamer.
[21:22.29]Dude, I can't do anything and talk at the same time.
[21:24.27]Don't you know?
[21:26.23]You guys have been around for long enough.
[21:27.63]You know I have so much trouble doing two things at once.
[21:31.89]Also, thank you to Comcast Customer Care for the $2.50.
[21:34.21]You're the number one insane aquarium streamer on Twitch.
[21:37.81]And that's pretty coveted.
[21:40.43]I'll take that any day of the week.
[21:43.35]This game does not suck.
[21:45.32]Jasmine, just trust me.
[21:46.14]Wait until we get into the challenge mode and you'll see the true skills that are necessary.
[21:53.21]But thank you also to NPC Fury for the $5.
[21:55.33]I've been watching your video since 2011, since I was in middle school.
[21:59.11]Don't know why I waited this long, but apparently this is the game that made me finally give you money directly.
[22:06.65]This is because it's a great game.
[22:08.73]There's nothing wrong with this game.
[22:12.34]There's no way to talk shit about Insane Aquarium.
[22:14.82]Especially the deluxe edition.
[22:16.70]You wanna talk about a game that I wish they would do like a big full-on remake of the whole game?
[22:22.19]It's this one.
[22:23.81]Can you imagine how fun this would be with new graphics, increased systems, X for fish, 25% more mascots?
[22:32.47]This game would be untouchable.
[22:37.62]I'm serious.
[22:38.26]This is what I want.
[22:38.94]I would love that.
[22:48.46]Increased systems.
[22:52.45]Alright, hold on.
[22:53.37]Watch it.
[22:53.59]This guy helps now.
[22:56.01]See?
[22:56.63]This one's got long lines.
[23:02.07]The aliens get stronger.
[23:03.09]They get more systems.
[23:10.15]Ah, my stomach.
[23:10.93]I can't laugh.
[23:12.29]Well, I can't laugh this hard.
[23:14.75]I gotta, like, I gotta be careful tonight.
[23:18.37]No, this is supposed to be a relaxing scream.
[23:29.40]I can't, like, belly laugh right now.
[23:30.92]Alright, let's get a...
[23:37.12]Oh, somebody died.
[23:38.84]Shit, I was gonna try to go through the whole thing without one dying.
[23:42.87]Oh, whoops.
[23:43.33]I need to... I gotta calm down.
[23:59.23]But I need $3,000?
[24:03.21]I'm not pregnant.
[24:06.01]I'm not pregnant.
[24:06.97]I'm sick.
[24:08.50]I'm not gonna get the bad ending.
[24:13.72]I probably should upgrade the laser.
[24:14.98]I'm gonna upgrade this ten times.
[24:20.73]Game's a bit loud.
[24:21.71]Is it really?
[24:22.37]Fuck, I gotta turn it down.
[24:36.30]Just wait till the aliens start coming out every, like, 12 seconds.
[24:39.46]There's a reason why this is called Insane Aquarium.
[24:47.57]Save Itchy.
[24:48.41]Itchy's fine.
[24:50.37]These guys can't lose.
[24:51.31]They can't die.
[24:55.17]This is why they're called Insane Aquarium!
[25:04.71]Oh, that was not a smart idea.
[25:10.62]I gotta start bringing in some carnivores now.
[25:13.04]Come on, come on, eat, eat, eat!
[25:17.56]Quick, quick, quick!
[25:19.92]Come on!
[25:20.84]Come on!
[25:22.37]Feed my children, hurry!
[25:23.71]I need to get $9,000 and I'm good to go.
[25:45.77]We're getting there.
[25:46.25]Not that much further.
[25:47.89]Oh no.
[25:49.25]He's gonna come wipe out the whole tank.
[25:51.08]Guarantee it.
[25:53.00]Oh shit, I... Alright, we're good.
[26:04.13]You can't let the diamonds hit the ground.
[26:06.47]Alright, I need... Enough.
[26:16.28]This game sucks, huh?
[26:20.90]I beg to differ.
[26:27.11]It's all about succession.
[26:30.65]It's all about making sure you have enough of each creature to fulfill your duties.
[26:34.88]That was a 3,000.
[26:37.50]We got our first egg piece.
[26:39.04]Bingo.
[26:43.31]There is no limit, guys.
[26:44.41]This is not like the typical video game you play where there's limits on something.
[26:47.99]I could take 5,000 of those fish.
[26:50.29]I just heard somebody say, prove it.
[26:59.32]See?
[27:02.60]They're not going to live, but...
[27:09.41]Here we are!
[27:10.33]I think we got Stinky down there collecting that money.
[27:14.49]Nobody said that.
[27:22.16]These people are dying.
[27:24.44]I just need one more egg piece and then I'll get it.
[27:32.56]It's fish over here.
[27:33.62]It's alright.
[27:34.94]Moving on to a new tank.
[27:36.28]Bingo.
[27:39.05]Alright, so now we have to make a choice here.
[27:41.23]Somebody made up a pregnant joke.
[27:42.73]Well, here's the pregnant one.
[27:43.71]Uh, tdoggtheman thanks for the one dollar.
[27:48.45]Jerma confirmed pregnant with Etalyx as baby.
[27:51.12]No.
[27:53.40]There is a pregnant fish though.
[27:56.36]Hey, Professor Ignatius thanks for the ten bucks.
[27:58.10]This game is great.
[27:58.76]Don't listen to the unenlightened.
[28:01.46]I won't.
[28:02.22]This game is fantastic.
[28:05.05]Also, Nuclear Chamber, thank you for the five dollars.
[28:07.09]I've been watching your video since 1985.
[28:09.57]I am madly in love with you.
[28:10.85]He he he.
[28:14.65]Um, what is love?
[28:16.33]You know?
[28:17.89]What is love?
[28:19.33]I don't know.
[28:19.71]I was supposed to go off on like a huge tangent there as like a joke, but I didn't want to waste everybody's time because it would have been a waste of a conversation.
[28:28.43]Thank you though.
[28:28.79]Thank you D Jack for the one dollar.
[28:30.41]Insane Aquarium deathmatch in the next Rumble, please.
[28:35.34]Gorgon Cal, thanks for the $1.
[28:36.64]Thank you for giving this game the justice it deserves.
[28:39.41]It's fantastic.
[28:41.65]I'm glad there's a lot of you that agree.
[28:45.69]CVFD721, thanks for the $2.45.
[28:47.85]Do you like anchovies on pizza?
[28:51.93]I don't think I've ever eaten an anchovy.
[28:55.48]Ever.
[28:56.52]I may have.
[28:57.96]I think I've maybe once or twice.
[28:59.22]Give me one second.
[29:01.60]The game might crash here.
[29:11.52]Yeah, well, it crashed.
[29:13.30]Just let me scroll down and do a couple more bits before we go.
[29:16.12]There was a $100 donation here that I want to get to.
[29:18.10]Fucking crashed.
[29:27.63]Thank you, Subtitles44 for the $1.
[29:29.95]Maisykit for the $1.
[29:31.85]Hey, look, leftover bits.
[29:33.07]Hey, thanks.
[29:34.01]Appreciate that.
[29:34.61]Fauxpaw, thanks for the $10.
[29:35.67]Hey, Jerma, thanks for all the entertainment and watching your stuff since 2013.
[29:39.01]Also, ever going to do a replay of Sorcery?
[29:42.26]I am probably not going to play Sorcery again.
[29:44.32]Unfortunately.
[29:45.60]It is a great, incredible series, and I highly recommend it if you've never played it.
[29:49.78]But I think we're done with that for now.
[29:51.82]And for now, I mean forever.
[29:54.00]Thank you, Chicho, for the $1.
[29:56.04]Hasnain for the $1.
[29:57.44]Tingy for the $1.
[29:58.42]Thanks a lot, guys, all three of you.
[30:00.02]This is one of those Wild Tangent games.
[30:01.78]Wild Tangent was a virus.
[30:03.58]You guys remember that shit?
[30:05.26]It was a virus.
[30:09.32]If you scanned your computer with Wild Tangent on it, it became one of those potentially unwanted programs and was just a computer virus.
[30:19.05]Storm of Shadow is the $100 donation here.
[30:22.67]Thank you so much, Storm of Shadow.
[30:24.85]Here, have $100.
[30:25.25]Buy yourself a new fish.
[30:27.63]Moon2S.
[30:28.65]Thank you again for all the entertaining content.
[30:30.54]Alright.
[30:31.94]Storm of Shadow, thank you so much for your $100 fucking dollars.
[30:36.24]That is a huge amount of money to give to somebody for playing a fish game.
[30:41.21]Oh, my God.
[30:45.47]Ewert Twirgy.
[30:47.89]If you're going to get $200, I better get your name right.
[30:51.75]Ewert Wedgie Ty Wertherd.
[30:56.97]Thank you for the $100 to $200.
[31:02.03]Stanley Parable stream, Papers Please stream.
[31:04.60]Both $100 donations.
[31:05.88]Oh my fucking lord.
[31:06.86]I didn't know.
[31:11.18]No paper.
[31:14.23]No.
[31:15.25]No.
[31:17.03]What the fuck?
[31:18.77]What are you thinking?
[31:21.07]You're giving me like $300 to play The Stanley Parable?
[31:28.31]I'm just sitting here- I just don't feel good today playing a PopCap game.
[31:34.90]Stanley Parable, Stanley Parable, Stanley Par- Stanley Parable!
[31:37.88]Why do you want me to play Stanley Parable?
[31:43.87]That- Just because I went to a black screen does not mean you're gonna get Stanley Parable.
[31:48.95]Stanley fucking Parable came out in like 2000- AH!
[31:57.05]Everybody already knows.
[31:58.09]I've already played The Stanley Parable.
[31:59.83]It's the funny English guy that goes like, Stanley went this way and you didn't go that way.
[32:04.77]So the story changes based on my narration.
[32:07.60]I've played it before.
[32:08.50]It's a great game.
[32:09.22]It was awesome for 2011.
[32:10.40]Where's my fish game?
[32:15.76]I need to relax.
[32:19.95]I need to fucking relax.
[32:25.39]Is it still on there?
[32:26.07]Where is it?
[32:27.44]Why can you not see it?
[32:34.79]Here we go.
[32:36.19]Oh my god.
[32:37.93]Well, that was fucking loud.
[32:39.55]There we go.
[32:40.05]So...
[32:53.99]Thank you, Ewert.
[32:55.49]Maybe one day I'll... Maybe one day I'll do The Stanley Parable.
[33:01.68]Turn on custom cursors?
[33:03.14]You got it.
[33:06.16]Take a look at that.
[33:06.74]Custom cursor.
[33:09.42]Uh, that's like... But honestly, man, you gave me like $400 to say The Stanley Parable.
[33:14.85]I need to turn it up a little.
[33:18.73]That's alright.
[33:19.23]No, that's alright.
[33:19.65]Alright.
[33:22.89]What do you mean normie background?
[33:27.09]What's wrong with my background?
[33:30.12]Why does everybody have such a problem with my backgrounds?
[33:34.06]Just because I made it something else?
[33:35.32]Just because I made it a normie background?
[33:37.88]What would you rather I have it?
[33:43.34]Make your, like, I'm... Okay, so... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[33:48.46]This is important.
[33:49.20]Ow, my stomach.
[33:49.78]That was not smart.
[33:51.67]Uh...
[33:52.37]This is where you get to choose your... Just like you... Okay, think of Hearthstone.
[33:56.65]You choose your deck, right?
[33:58.75]I've got my... I've got my... My Robomage.
[34:03.88]What was it called?
[34:04.50]Mage Druid.
[34:05.96]And what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put in two Insanobots.
[34:10.34]Two Gift of the Wild.
[34:11.48]This is where you make your deck.
[34:13.54]Deck building.
[34:15.96]See, right now we only have four decks to make.
[34:21.42]And I don't know.
[34:21.90]This is where you get... Eventually, we get a huge amount of cards here.
[34:26.48]That's the meta.
[34:27.28]What's the meta?
[34:27.86]I don't know.
[34:28.20]Definitely want the pregnant lady because the pregnant lady shoots out a fish.
[34:32.47]Gives birth to a new regular fish every 30 seconds.
[34:37.25]I think I want to hold on to Itchy here because Itchy helps it by... No, fuck Itchy.
[34:40.57]He sucks.
[34:41.80]I'm going to do Nico because the pearl is $300.
[34:43.32]Really, really good quality.
[34:45.85]Good cost per usual.
[34:48.37]You know what I'm saying?
[34:49.13]Cost per usual.
[34:49.97]That's what you want to have there.
[34:50.95]Stinky.
[34:51.97]Roams around, collects the coins you don't get just because I'm a lazy guy.
[34:54.89]Bingo.
[34:55.33]Dream team.
[35:01.63]Ugh.
[35:03.54]Hey, thank you Danger Illustrator for the five dollars.
[35:05.46]I want to be part of this bit train.
[35:06.74]Also, I recommend playing Dusk.
[35:08.70]It just went into early access.
[35:09.78]You might enjoy it.
[35:10.76]Dusk.
[35:12.70]I'll give it a look.
[35:14.20]Thank you for the suggestion.
[35:14.94]Thank you for the money as well.
[35:15.89]Thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[35:18.97]Oh, you guys are gonna love this.
[35:24.29]There, here you go.
[35:25.47]There's a funny, like, I shit out a baby for you skits.
[35:31.64]Where's the music?
[35:32.30]The music's going right now.
[35:36.20]See, that saves me $100.
[35:37.16]Remember I told you cost per usable?
[35:39.56]If you're going to do something that the usual thing to do is to buy like four or five of these.
[35:46.27]I don't need to do that.
[35:47.93]So my cost per usual is her putting out like $600, $700 worth of fish.
[35:51.27]I can save that money.
[36:02.18]I already played Frog Fractions on stream already.
[36:10.22]Uh-oh.
[36:13.65]Aliens.
[36:14.95]I gotta be careful here, because this is when the game actually turns into a video game.
[36:21.57]The mascot.
[36:23.47]This is really loud, ain't it?
[36:27.22]Alright, so when the alien... Let's drop this a little.
[36:34.82]Gabe Degrosi, thank you for the $15.
[36:37.46]Jeremiah, I recently got banned from a stream because I said hi twice.
[36:42.59]I just want to say your mods are all ace and you're amazing.
[36:45.55]Keep it up.
[36:46.41]Just kidding.
[36:46.95]P.S.
[36:47.21]I hope you see you in the Rumble.
[36:48.37]Wait, what happened?
[36:50.52]You got banned from this?
[36:52.10]I was... Somebody died.
[36:58.06]Sorry.
[37:04.52]Honey twice.
[37:05.72]What are you talking about?
[37:09.68]I don't... I don't know if I... I don't know if that's the whole story.
[37:14.08]That might not be the whole story.
[37:16.29]But thank you Gabe, the Glue Man, Negrosi, for the 15 bucks.
[37:19.11]Appreciate it.
[37:20.89]Gorgon, Cal, thanks for the one dollar.
[37:22.05]Hey, can you turn up the music a little bit?
[37:23.39]Yeah, I will do that.
[37:28.21]Just for now.
[37:31.13]Yeah, I killed a fish accidentally.
[37:34.64]I gotta start paying attention to this, especially the diamonds.
[37:37.78]So let's get another one of these guys.
[37:39.02]We need $5,000 per piece of the trifecta from The Legend of Zelda, whatever it's called, the Triforce.
[37:52.07]Let's do, we're going with consolidation here.
[37:54.39]No nonsense.
[37:55.53]Get him away from the corner.
[37:59.79]By the way, if you shoot him, you can keep him locked in a corner.
[38:03.42]As long as you shoot them... Essentially, they'll go away from wherever you're... Why am I... Why the fuck do I even say this?
[38:09.48]Like, you guys are paying attention to the core gameplay mechanics of Insane Aquarium?
[38:13.04]That's not happening.
[38:13.66]Am I giving you, like, gameplay commentary tips on how to play this game?
[38:20.41]Why am I doing that?
[38:24.59]Come on, hurry up, he's gonna die.
[38:25.71]The theory is you just get to feed these guys with the free pregnant ladies.
[38:30.91]Free pregnant, um, babies.
[38:36.21]Ah, I missed a diamond.
[38:37.21]That sucks.
[38:38.71]I think actually I'm going to have to put one out here myself.
[38:43.07]Alright, I'm going to do a laser beam next.
[38:44.65]I feel like that's a smart move.
[38:48.76]They're eating the babies.
[38:49.60]Yes, they are.
[38:49.96]It's a food chain, man.
[38:54.40]See?
[38:56.60]That little shit didn't even last ten seconds.
[39:01.56]That's so terrible when you think about it.
[39:05.45]Hey, come brand new!
[39:06.95]Come into this world!
[39:09.22]A new child!
[39:10.86]Gone.
[39:12.72]That's pretty morbid.
[39:17.86]Let's get another laser beam.
[39:19.30]Get to level 3 or level 2.
[39:23.21]Do not waste my time here.
[39:29.43]Stay away!
[39:29.99]That was close.
[39:35.08]And we keep going.
[39:38.64]I don't like this video game cursor.
[39:40.80]It feels like it's a little slow and laggy.
[39:42.32]I can't do good clicks on anything.
[39:44.62]I'm gonna turn off the cursor.
[39:49.60]Might as well just shit the baby into his mouth.
[39:52.62]Wow!
[39:53.30]Okay, hold on.
[39:58.79]Now that out of context.
[40:00.96]is not something that is a sentence anyone should ever say.
[40:05.56]So, um... Let's just... Let's just move on from that one.
[40:10.34]5,000.
[40:10.36]There it is.
[40:12.60]We're talking about fish!
[40:23.69]Turn off curses to improve APM.
[40:25.85]Yes, that's true.
[40:27.44]Check this out.
[40:29.87]See?
[40:30.49]See how it's much smoother?
[40:31.49]I'm not going to upgrade any of the food, because what's the point?
[40:38.17]I'm going to get to 5,000 here in a second.
[40:42.80]What does two do?
[40:43.68]Okay, so this means I can drop more than... Somebody died, who cares?
[40:47.04]This is just multiple deaths, doesn't even matter.
[40:52.44]I win.
[40:53.50]That's how many pieces of food you can drop at one time.
[40:57.94]Zorf the seahorse.
[40:58.68]Zorf gives you a hand in keeping your fish fed.
[41:02.87]Okay, bonus.
[41:03.37]This is important.
[41:03.93]We've got to collect the shells.
[41:05.35]This is where my actions per second really matter here.
[41:27.02]Got it.
[41:30.92]So now it costs 20,000 shells to buy another pet.
[41:36.83]My new balance is 763.
[41:39.65]As you can see, this is where the game gets addicting because this is where you unlock super pets.
[41:46.15]You know what I'm saying?
[41:47.63]Again, our deck, our deck, because that's how I can talk to you guys.
[41:52.07]You know, the younger crowd.
[41:54.29]I'm making my deck again, right?
[41:56.98]Deck!
[41:59.72]I'm gonna go with Zorf, we're gonna go with Niko, and we're gonna go with Prego.
[42:08.00]Because this one feeds the fish.
[42:11.10]Welcome to the second tank, now things get tricky.
[42:16.36]See?
[42:16.54]I don't even... This is where the game sits back and plays itself.
[42:19.00]I don't have to do anything.
[42:24.03]You don't like the... You don't like Prego.
[42:25.59]Prego was really great for the early game.
[42:27.98]Free fish.
[42:28.42]I don't have to do anything.
[42:29.66]I can just sit here and just read bits.
[42:33.78]The game will play itself if you're smart enough.
[42:38.29]You know, you have to have an intelligence level that's at least... I mean, let's be real here.
[42:43.37]You have to have an intelligence level to play this game at the level that I am.
[42:47.63]With at least a 6th or 7th grade reading level.
[42:52.08]So, I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[42:53.44]It takes a little bit.
[42:57.89]Thank you, uh... Alright, I got everybody.
[43:00.69]We're good.
[43:07.46]What do you say?
[43:09.36]Let's make it interesting.
[43:12.76]I am gonna have to start to get involved here.
[43:16.47]Come on, nobody ate the good pill.
[43:18.97]Why?
[43:20.65]I can't shoot any more than one at a time.
[43:21.95]That's why you always have to do it up here, because you're gonna fuck it up.
[43:23.97]You're gonna die.
[43:27.65]Uh-oh.
[43:30.83]And it's five dollars to do one... See?
[43:34.10]I was close.
[43:39.66]I prevailed, though.
[43:40.50]I prevailed.
[43:41.60]So now, this is a new item.
[43:43.60]Buy a star potion.
[43:44.60]What this does is when you feed it to... I believe they have to be... I believe one of these fishes, they have to be at full size.
[43:55.39]And then once they're full size, when they're hungry, instead of feeding them food, you feed them a star potion and they become an upgraded fish.
[44:02.95]Check it.
[44:05.48]What the fuck is going on here?
[44:15.72]I thought... Wait, that... How do I have this incorrect?
[44:24.86]I don't get it.
[44:30.81]I gotta rethink this here.
[44:32.39]I think I have to unlock the other... Yeah, okay, I get it.
[44:35.37]You gotta feed the star potion to... You know, I just don't remember, but it's okay.
[44:41.15]It is a great upgrade.
[44:42.95]It's a necessary upgrade.
[44:47.27]I thought you feed this to the... Okay, no, that is what you do, but all these idiots are getting in the way, and if they're not fully grown, then it kills them.
[44:59.91]farts.
[45:00.65]It's not a fart.
[45:01.35]It's a pregnancy.
[45:07.18]I want to see... Am I right here?
[45:08.74]Let's wait till everybody's starving to death.
[45:10.42]Let's do like a fucked up experiment.
[45:13.12]Wait till everyone is starving to death and then drop it and see what happens.
[45:19.48]Somebody get that.
[45:20.38]You stupid little shit.
[45:24.58]Okay, well, I'm apparently incorrect here somehow.
[45:30.75]I already have to level beat anyway, so who cares?
[45:32.35]There we go.
[45:37.13]Clyde the jellyfish.
[45:37.99]Clyde drifts slowly through your tank, collecting any coins it passes by.
[45:42.39]So what you could end up doing is you could do Stinky and Clyde together and do a bunch of coin collection.
[45:49.46]Which, I think I'll do that.
[45:50.80]Let's do Stinky and Clyde.
[45:54.12]And... Let's go with Nico.
[45:56.48]Let's go with a lot of... I feel like I'm missing coins.
[45:59.08]You guys feel like that too?
[45:59.91]I think that is what's going on.
[46:05.11]Clyde is trash.
[46:08.15]Um... I don't think he is.
[46:09.57]Yeah, Clyde joins the fray.
[46:13.85]And don't worry, just wait till we do another Jerma rumble.
[46:16.41]And I do a 30-person rumble with only the Insane Aquarium characters.
[46:24.91]Uh, you don't think that's gonna happen?
[46:30.94]Like, I'm gonna do every insane aquarium animal as a rumble.
[46:34.44]So, you better get invested.
[46:37.18]Better get invested now in some of these characters!
[46:44.53]That's gonna take so long.
[46:46.83]It takes like 45 minutes to make a character in that game.
[46:49.87]I'm gonna spend like 30 hours making insane aquarium only characters.
[46:55.75]I'm gonna have to do that in 2K14.
[46:58.53]You can't make, like, fucking monsters in the latest shitty ones.
[47:03.51]And by the way, will they fire visual concepts already?
[47:05.94]I know they're not going to, but... That's a terrible thing for me to say.
[47:13.26]But it's true.
[47:13.76]30 hour stream.
[47:18.36]Alright, gotta be careful.
[47:23.92]And where you gonna spawn?
[47:24.94]Down.
[47:30.18]I need an upgrade.
[47:30.82]This is taking too long.
[47:32.36]Just wait till we get to the other aliens.
[47:34.22]Okay, now these guys you feed the potions to.
[47:37.40]I'm almost certain of that.
[47:41.38]Fuck!
[47:41.80]What?
[47:43.18]What's going on with this shit?
[47:44.86]I don't understand.
[47:45.52]Why?
[47:49.58]Come on!
[47:59.41]I need to make sure.
[48:01.53]Who... Oh.
[48:05.11]It's alright.
[48:06.39]Don't worry.
[48:07.91]You have to... Ready?
[48:08.95]Let's do it.
[48:10.05]I knew it!
[48:10.57]I told you guys.
[48:12.52]See?
[48:13.44]Now they shit out stars.
[48:15.66]Oh, it's alright.
[48:16.32]We're learning again.
[48:18.96]So how this works now is these guys eat the stars.
[48:22.42]Oh, fuck.
[48:22.90]I need to get rid of these two.
[48:24.10]These two are the worst to have here.
[48:26.82]Yeah, Clyde really is a bad idea here.
[48:30.01]Well, I don't think this is winnable.
[48:32.53]Because these guys have to eat the stars.
[48:35.49]And if they're just being collected automatically, then they're all going to die.
[48:40.76]Let's see if it'll work.
[48:44.60]Alright, we need a star catcher.
[48:45.60]Star catcher over here.
[48:47.20]Oh, god damn it.
[48:49.78]God damn it.
[48:50.57]It's over.
[48:51.25]No, it's not.
[48:53.01]It's almost over.
[48:53.69]It'll be over if this guy dies.
[48:58.68]No!
[48:59.40]Oh, it's over.
[49:01.20]I got the worst team here.
[49:03.76]My deck sucks.
[49:06.92]This guy has to stay alive or the whole thing's over.
[49:09.38]If this guy's... Just calm down.
[49:11.19]I'll be fine.
[49:11.69]I'm not going to lose one level.
[49:15.55]Let's get a few more fish in here.
[49:17.47]Let's just get a good collection of star shitters.
[49:21.01]And we'll move on from here.
[49:21.83]Let's upgrade the food a little bit.
[49:25.29]Make it a little bit spicier.
[49:29.10]There we go.
[49:29.56]Now we have the best food is the pill food.
[49:31.31]I mean, I am going to blame it on the deck.
[49:40.43]Don't you dare insult Clyde.
[49:43.91]Yeah, he's going to get thrown over the top ropes first in the Insane Aquarium Rumble.
[49:50.83]The one guy that don't let him die.
[49:52.39]Nice job, Clyde.
[49:54.59]Excellent work, you two.
[49:55.39]I have two of you and you can't even collect one thing.
[49:59.42]Well, you really are the worst.
[50:00.40]Alright, really get these guys big.
[50:08.40]Clyde and Slug, are you crazy?
[50:12.62]Like, I- I- this was a stupid idea.
[50:16.13]But I forgot the mechanics, I forgot the game system to this level.
[50:20.62]How about I do it in a real fish tank next stream?
[50:22.82]You know, that would be funny.
[50:35.68]Jesus.
[50:36.16]Alright, let's get this going.
[50:40.26]Everyone's almost big.
[50:47.84]Stinky and Clyde suck, yeah.
[50:49.30]They're the worst.
[50:52.25]Now, let's give it a go here.
[50:56.73]Are you big guys hungry yet?
[50:58.93]I need to have at least three of you shitting out stars before I do anything.
[51:03.70]Hungry?
[51:05.32]Hungry?
[51:07.00]No, not you.
[51:07.44]You.
[51:07.94]Got it.
[51:08.16]Okay.
[51:10.88]I've got two.
[51:11.38]I'm going to do the weapon upgrade.
[51:20.25]Just wait till we get some real fucking interesting decks.
[51:23.85]Like, combo rogue.
[51:27.33]What was that one rogue deck that you played one card and it made a guy like 40-40?
[51:33.01]What was it called?
[51:33.49]Indivisible rogue?
[51:36.57]Indescribable rogue?
[51:37.53]Alright, now let's get one of these guys in here.
[51:42.19]And these guys now, when they eat a star, they pop up something else.
[51:45.37]Like a diamond, I think.
[51:47.09]Pretty certain that you pop a diamond out when you eat that.
[51:49.90]Yes.
[51:52.16]There we are.
[51:53.72]Don't die.
[51:54.44]Come over here, please.
[51:57.90]Easy.
[51:58.04]Where are you going to go?
[51:59.04]Don't spawn on the right.
[51:59.74]I'm sorry.
[52:00.94]He's dead.
[52:03.10]Get out of the way!
[52:04.32]Get out of the way.
[52:04.86]I have to bounce him.
[52:05.54]Thank God.
[52:06.18]That would have been so annoying.
[52:07.25]He needs to eat.
[52:10.71]Alright.
[52:14.67]Don't let the glide pick that up.
[52:17.65]Alright.
[52:17.87]Let's get another guy in there.
[52:21.97]I no longer can touch these stars.
[52:25.29]That is a mistake.
[52:30.13]Somebody else needs to turn view right here.
[52:36.52]Got it.
[52:36.76]Nice.
[52:38.78]Nice!
[52:39.50]Got it!
[52:43.57]Almost there.
[52:47.99]Should I feed this guy too?
[52:48.71]What do you think?
[52:50.99]That was a bad idea.
[52:51.75]That was a really stupid idea.
[52:53.07]I think I blew it.
[52:55.13]No?
[52:55.39]It's alright.
[52:56.45]What do I got?
[52:56.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[52:58.57]Eat that, please!
[52:59.03]Come on!
[52:59.35]Eat it!
[52:59.57]One of you guys eat it!
[53:00.81]That's such a waste of time and money!
[53:02.97]That guy didn't even need it.
[53:03.78]I got it!
[53:09.10]He actually ate it.
[53:09.90]Nice.
[53:14.02]Now we just relax and collect the diamonds.
[53:20.79]I love this game.
[53:21.99]What a fucking great video game.
[53:25.41]I could sit here and play this with my children, you know what I mean?
[53:32.28]No, stay over there.
[53:33.92]Stay over there.
[53:37.22]First piece of the egg.
[53:40.18]This game is a roguelike?
[53:41.14]Yeah, it is.
[53:44.00]If any of you fish die, it's over.
[53:45.24]If you get to zero fish, goodbye.
[53:47.97]Roguelike RPG...
[53:52.42]Congrats on the pregnancy announcement.
[53:53.96]What the hell are you talking about?
[53:57.46]I had a preg- Who's pregnant?
[54:02.59]This is news to me!
[54:03.61]Alright, they're definitely shitting out enough where I can have a couple more of these guys.
[54:10.41]Just litter the floor with them.
[54:16.34]What is it?
[54:17.08]Is somebody like announcing on Twitter that they're pregnant?
[54:24.34]Just letting you know everybody, I'm pregnant!
[54:26.94]And they show the stick.
[54:29.09]And by the way, it's Jerma985's baby!
[54:33.71]I'm just sitting here playing Insane Aquarium with like a bad stomachache.
[54:39.33]That would be an interesting way to say you're pregnant.
[54:44.30]Or, oh no no no, it would be, hey guys, we're pregnant, and then at Jerma985.
[54:54.09]It's confirmed?
[54:55.91]Stop it.
[54:56.43]There is no confirmation.
[54:57.49]Watch out for these fucking aliens.
[55:05.97]Alright, who's next?
[55:10.81]Vert the skeleton.
[55:14.27]This guy's alright.
[55:16.33]Vert drops gold coins just like a large guppy, but he doesn't need food.
[55:19.45]So he's just an unkillable fish that drops a gold coin.
[55:24.62]Let's hold on a second.
[55:27.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[55:28.98]So 5, 10, 15, 20.
[55:30.78]I really could do another rumble with these stupid idiots.
[55:37.26]I like that.
[55:37.64]It's a great early game.
[55:39.72]It gives you good board control early.
[55:43.58]These guys, I don't want either one of these two here.
[55:45.32]So we're just going to go with money generation.
[55:47.92]Hmm.
[55:55.31]Please do what?
[55:57.67]Do it?
[55:58.07]No, I'm going to do it.
[56:01.09]We have to see what all the fish are.
[56:02.75]You know, we have to get to unlock everything.
[56:05.91]These ones I'm not going to be able to unlock on this stream though because that's like 50 hours of playing the game.
[56:11.97]These are the bonus guys and you actually have to play the game for like 50 to 100 hours to unlock them.
[56:17.81]So we're going to get a good 5, 10, 15, 20 person rumble.
[56:25.19]Look, everybody was talking so much shit about, like, get out of this game.
[56:28.33]Now you guys want me to play this for a hundred hours to unlock these guys?
[56:32.97]That's not gonna happen.
[56:35.43]Who's the last person I want?
[56:37.06]Uh, we'll go with... We'll go with Zorf.
[56:40.00]I think that's good.
[56:41.86]Feeding the fish without me doing anything.
[56:45.62]Thank you, Buck Rooster, for the five bucks.
[56:48.54]Shit, I'm not collecting these.
[56:51.04]Whenever you read my username out loud, I get dizzy from pleasure.
[56:55.97]well hey okay as the as they say to each his own whatever except no except no except no don't back backing myself into a wall here I'm kind of backing up into a corner of this one um Mr. skeletonfish is great
[57:25.75]That's the wrong guy.
[57:27.03]That's the wrong guy.
[57:31.51]That's not what that guy said.
[57:34.15]Buck Rooster did not say that.
[57:36.71]Let's go ahead and redo this.
[57:38.73]I just told all you guys now think that Buck Rooster, I give him pleasure.
[57:45.62]Let me fix that.
[57:47.94]That was the wrong person.
[57:49.59]Comcast Customer Care gave $2.50 and said, Whenever you pay your internet bill, I get dizzy with pleasure.
[57:55.75]So that's a good... Okay, warning.
[57:58.71]A new breed of alien is fast approaching.
[58:00.55]Lasers can't hurt this baddie, so find another way to defeat it.
[58:05.28]Oh, wait.
[58:06.24]Oh, this is the food one.
[58:08.06]Watch this one.
[58:09.02]I'll get this one quick.
[58:09.70]It's the gluttony from Fullmetal Alchemist.
[58:16.44]Got it.
[58:17.82]Some aliens you need to feed to death.
[58:22.67]I just spent a lot of money.
[58:24.91]Uh, anyways, uh, Nuclear Chamber, thanks for the one dollar.
[58:27.11]Whenever you read my username out loud, I get dizzy with pleasure.
[58:29.47]You did say that!
[58:30.29]No, what's going on here?
[58:35.93]Okay, no, Buck Rooster, that's who did say that.
[58:38.49]Buck Rooster actually said, for five dollars, thanks a lot, Buck.
[58:40.80]When are you going to release a Jerma card game so you can show off your deck building skills?
[58:46.96]um probably not for like another 30 years but I can't n a fish what north American fish let's get these guys all the big I'm gonna save money here thank you though thank you also to gnostic for the one dollar thanks to the master class
[59:14.63]Masterclass.
[59:16.71]What did I do?
[59:18.07]Oh, because I'm the champion.
[59:20.88]I understand.
[59:23.96]What's my favorite fish?
[59:26.96]Definitely a hammerhead shark.
[59:28.88]I didn't even collect that.
[59:33.77]Hammerhead shark is definitely the best fish.
[59:37.47]It's another food guy.
[59:38.53]Type G. Type G is food.
[59:43.02]Shit!
[59:43.57]Shit!
[59:44.93]It's alright.
[59:51.11]A hammerhead shark is a fish, right?
[59:53.49]Are sharks classified as something else?
[59:56.20]Isn't a shark a shark?
[59:59.50]If you go to Wikipedia, you type in shark.
[60:01.20]Isn't it...
[60:02.84]Shark and then in brackets it has like a Latin name like as Gorpheus and off of this No, no, it's shark bracket shark Shark is its own shark branch, right?
[60:15.67]Why do they do that I don't understand that shit If you're gonna name something just name it Why does it have to have like a weird scientific name I
[60:30.70]The lobster, or in actuality, the Ascathius crustaceus.
[60:36.53]Just call it a fucking lobster.
[60:39.91]Like a beetle, for instance.
[60:42.35]Hey, what is that bug?
[60:43.39]Oh, that is a blue beetle.
[60:46.80]Oh, sorry, no, that's a blue Ascathius tyrannosaurus.
[60:52.22]Get out of here.
[60:55.68]We only have those names, so we can just pretend to be fucking intelligent when we say them.
[61:04.96]Like, for instance, like, DOG.
[61:07.33]It's a dog.
[61:08.39]Oh shit, he's gonna eat everybody.
[61:11.31]Just barely get out of that one alive.
[61:15.69]Yeah, type in Wikipedia, type in DOG in Wikipedia, and tell me what the actual name for a dog is.
[61:24.26]Carnivorous Canaris.
[61:25.96]Carnivorous Canaris.
[61:27.26]Like, why?
[61:33.74]Dog 1.
[61:35.28]Dog 2.
[61:37.19]Dog 3.
[61:39.81]That's what it should be.
[61:44.95]Spider 1.
[61:46.65]Spider 2.
[61:47.39]And it goes up to, like, spider, like, 480.
[61:48.87]Or Green Spider 1.
[61:56.19]Orange Spider 4!
[61:58.79]Don't fucking overcomplicate it, you science pricks!
[62:01.69]Alright, hold on.
[62:03.25]I'm like losing track.
[62:04.23]What am I doing?
[62:04.73]Alright, I got a lot of money here.
[62:09.37]Let's make it happen.
[62:10.95]Ready?
[62:11.31]Bingo.
[62:11.85]Bingo.
[62:12.35]Bingo.
[62:12.85]Bingo.
[62:14.39]Get some stars here.
[62:15.11]Come on.
[62:18.03]Star it up.
[62:21.40]There it is.
[62:22.54]Come on!
[62:23.92]Somebody eat these!
[62:24.42]Waste of $750!
[62:25.22]Don't!
[62:27.24]Yes!
[62:27.76]Alright.
[62:28.16]Be careful.
[62:28.52]Hiccups of type G. Don't be right over here, please.
[62:38.35]Fucking asshole.
[62:39.19]It's alright.
[62:39.89]Let's get a bunch of these now.
[62:42.77]That might have been too many.
[62:50.63]Don't even upgrade the gun.
[62:51.61]There's no reason to.
[62:52.45]I need to upgrade the food.
[62:54.25]So I can just spam it on that guy.
[62:56.17]I can do seven foods.
[63:02.99]Seven foods.
[63:03.78]It's seven different cuisines.
[63:06.00]That's another one.
[63:07.06]Think about this.
[63:07.88]Really, you gotta go over this in your brains.
[63:10.30]Again.
[63:11.54]Food.
[63:13.38]Cuisine.
[63:15.76]Stop what?
[63:16.50]Food.
[63:16.76]Why does it have to be called cuisine?
[63:19.19]Cuisine.
[63:20.10]It's food.
[63:23.14]When somebody brings you a plate and there's cooked meat on it, it's not cuisine.
[63:28.25]It's food.
[63:37.03]You know what?
[63:38.15]Take the whole thesaurus and burn it.
[63:41.67]Why do we have words that mean the same word?
[63:44.61]What's wrong with us?
[63:47.71]RIP the fucking thesaurus in half!
[63:49.82]What's the point?
[63:50.80]Why is it there?
[63:51.54]To confuse people?
[63:56.06]We should not have any synonyms!
[63:57.88]Just have every- What is it?
[64:00.05]That's what the word is.
[64:07.49]Oh shit, that guy's gonna die.
[64:09.25]Nah, he's good.
[64:13.62]Book burning.
[64:19.20]Ow, my stomach.
[64:25.81]What's the point of saying Jerma if your name is Jeremy?
[64:29.11]Well, that's real easy.
[64:30.13]Because that's my internet online handle.
[64:35.07]Food does not have an internet username.
[64:39.21]Cuisine421 is not food's online handle.
[64:45.86]It's an alias.
[64:46.92]Food doesn't go by an alias.
[64:54.64]And some people are asking, why do we have first and last names?
[64:58.40]Because one of them is... One of them is just a point of contact, and the other one is lineage.
[65:05.71]Right?
[65:06.93]So you might as well call it Food Cuisine.
[65:08.65]Food's the first name, cuisine's the last name.
[65:17.69]Alright, we got Rufus.
[65:20.33]Rufus actually is really, really good.
[65:27.88]rufus is very good what you do is you stuff somebody down in the corner and he does massive damage I could really go for a sloppy Joe underscore 1996 right now yeah that's exactly what I'm saying like what if you go to McDonald's and you order a big mac you don't order well no that this no that's wrong because a big mac is food
[65:54.92]It's not like you go to McDonald's and everything on the menu is food.
[65:58.91]Food, one, food.
[65:59.87]No, that would be like actually kind of funny because Big Mac, Big Mac on like the HTML color list, right?
[66:07.64]If everything is just food and then a number, imagine like needing to memorize all that shit and needing to know that a Burger King Whopper is food hash like 4892666185.
[66:17.72]Now that's like a, that's a Whopper.
[66:25.45]That'd be fucking stupid.
[66:26.89]Like the whole menu is like that.
[66:29.87]It would be a total fucking mess.
[66:32.13]Whopper is like FF hash 49662525.
[66:37.80]Underneath it is large fry at like FF hash 1011985555.
[66:40.70]Come on, we're talking comedy.
[66:53.98]You don't understand?
[66:56.21]What would the code be for Aspie?
[66:58.69]We're talking about food.
[67:06.49]Niko is kind of... I don't like Niko anymore.
[67:10.17]We're going to go with Vert.
[67:13.76]And... Zorf sucks.
[67:17.50]I'll go Stinky.
[67:18.40]No.
[67:18.60]I guess we're going to have to stay with Niko.
[67:24.63]Yeah, we're gonna put food on the blockchain.
[67:26.09]It's gonna be decentralized food.
[67:27.59]You're gonna have to have a fucking 24-character hash to order a Burger King Big Mac.
[67:36.39]It's gonna be based on the Ethereum blockchain.
[67:39.93]It's gonna be an ERC-20 token.
[67:41.35]Ass.
[67:58.55]Burger King... Wait, I didn't say... Did I say Burger King Big Mac?
[68:02.01]No, I didn't.
[68:05.61]No, I didn't.
[68:06.17]Did I say that?
[68:07.35]I told you, I'm sick right now.
[68:08.68]I'm like delirious.
[68:14.22]This is like... I've felt... I feel bad right now.
[68:19.18]And I'm just projecting.
[68:20.12]I'm using like this dumb food conversation to take my mind off the fact that my tummy hurts.
[68:30.37]Alright, this is going to be the hard one.
[68:35.59]And we have potential for a Fuji.
[68:36.75]It's not going to be... What is it?
[68:41.48]Type D. Type D is not the feeding one.
[68:45.98]I think it's just a regular alien.
[68:47.10]We're going to stuff him down in the corner.
[68:49.58]Oh, it's this guy.
[68:50.26]I forgot.
[68:51.96]He shoots the missiles.
[68:55.50]That guy shoots... Homing missile shoots three of your fish.
[69:03.02]The baby is kicking.
[69:06.26]You guys are fucking out of control.
[69:10.08]The worst one is the octopus.
[69:11.63]That's all I remember.
[69:21.37]Come on, give me a break.
[69:22.69]I don't feel good.
[69:24.50]Such a great excuse when you can't even speak English.
[69:28.57]As a native English speaker.
[69:30.78]Homie Michelle shoots!
[69:32.60]I don't know how to say that.
[69:34.06]Homie Michelle shoots!
[69:37.32]Yeah, the octopus is the worst one.
[69:39.22]He's so fast, he just flies around the screen.
[69:41.12]It's the worst thing.
[69:44.97]Let's do this a few more times.
[69:47.03]I don't want any accidental deaths here.
[69:51.15]Let's get these guys all to max level before we drop any magic potions.
[70:01.61]I think actually now is a good time to do it.
[70:03.49]Do it.
[70:05.45]Do it.
[70:06.71]Alright, here we go.
[70:13.90]Type D, it's another one of those stupid rocket launcher people.
[70:16.20]Get him down to the crab.
[70:26.00]Comzo.
[70:26.86]Not yet.
[70:27.50]Almost.
[70:30.51]Alright, we got one more guy that needs to be turned into... Eat that.
[70:35.12]Are you serious?
[70:36.46]You're not hungry?
[70:38.82]Fuck.
[70:40.10]He's gonna be hungry now, right?
[70:42.18]Come on, eat it!
[70:44.96]Get it!
[70:46.28]Get it!
[70:47.44]Oh, you dumb, stupid little asshole fish.
[70:50.55]Of course, now he's hungry.
[70:52.41]Now let's start putting down these dudes.
[70:56.95]I do want the laser because I'm not going to deal with somebody shooting.
[70:59.99]Because if he does a homing missile over here, these guys are dead.
[71:01.71]And I said that really fast.
[71:04.61]It was very quickly said.
[71:07.31]Rufus is a better streamer than Jerma.
[71:10.53]He's not streaming.
[71:11.52]I'm the streamer.
[71:12.36]It's me that's streaming.
[71:13.78]Not any of these dumb creatures.
[71:22.10]I did just say I wanted to get a laser, but I'm an impatient loser.
[71:31.68]We got any bits while I got a second here?
[71:35.88]Thank you, TyX49 for the one dollar.
[71:39.38]Shit your pants on stream.
[71:43.26]It's not impossible that that could happen.
[71:46.72]I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.
[71:49.89]But how am I supposed to guarantee that?
[71:57.69]There we are.
[71:58.17]Nice.
[71:58.57]Excellent work there, Rufus.
[72:03.34]We're almost at the third... third world.
[72:07.34]Which is my favorite.
[72:09.29]It's fish has to eat fish has to eat fish.
[72:13.09]I call it the dog-eat-dog world.
[72:14.91]That's world three.
[72:17.71]Almost there.
[72:22.19]Eat it.
[72:23.31]Uh, thank you Nuclear Chamber for the two dollars.
[72:26.76]And you say...
[72:29.68]Uh, I bet you'll say it again.
[72:30.98]Hee hee.
[72:31.56]Say what?
[72:32.14]What did I say?
[72:36.06]I need more of these.
[72:36.64]I'm not getting enough income.
[72:39.22]Yeah, we're gonna have to go.
[72:40.08]We're gonna have to get a few more of these guys.
[72:46.43]We gotta get them all at the same time leveled up.
[72:48.77]I ain't having...
[72:52.15]It's one of those micromanagement weird things where your brain... I hate when I have, like, completely upgraded fishes in my pan and then some other downgraded ones.
[73:00.35]Drives me nuts.
[73:03.79]And I put that in the worst spot possible.
[73:06.94]Like, what a dippy.
[73:12.20]Eat it.
[73:13.28]Yep.
[73:14.62]Alright, time to, uh... I just panicked.
[73:17.00]I don't know why I did that.
[73:17.71]That was so dumb.
[73:18.47]No, that wasn't a bad idea.
[73:19.37]It's gonna be... Here comes a... I got it.
[73:20.77]Ready?
[73:21.09]Go.
[73:24.78]Alright, now we can focus.
[73:28.72]I wish there was a way I could just auto-collect.
[73:37.15]And not have, like, a dumb stupid fish do it.
[73:39.45]I want, like, just the silver coins to get auto-collected.
[73:41.75]It would be so much better.
[73:47.05]Once you get a dream team of three or four people...
[73:50.32]There's a shark that does a lot of damage that runs around.
[73:52.44]You can get the shark and Rufus and the swordfish.
[73:57.78]You can do massive damage to any monster.
[73:59.82]And then they're really, really, really necessary later on.
[74:01.72]They just are, especially in like the challenges.
[74:04.36]Almost did the first piece.
[74:09.42]Alright, finally I'm able to get these guys leveled up.
[74:16.07]Everybody is.
[74:16.67]So now nobody gets food anymore.
[74:21.94]From here on out, you all have to eat green potions.
[74:25.89]And I don't want to hear a goddamn thing about it.
[74:29.87]So wait till they're all starving.
[74:32.57]And use that to the advantage.
[74:35.15]And feed them all.
[74:36.39]Here.
[74:36.97]We.
[74:37.39]Go.
[74:45.96]Ah!
[74:46.28]Almost.
[74:46.86]That was close enough.
[74:48.00]I got like four or five.
[74:48.98]We died.
[74:50.08]Oh.
[74:57.11]That may have been a little too many.
[75:00.10]A few too many.
[75:03.08]Well, at least I know that no one's going to go hungry.
[75:07.08]Actually, no, people are going to go hungry.
[75:08.40]That's exactly what the problem is.
[75:11.08]Look, as long as I can keep this up for at least five, less than five minutes.
[75:21.03]Ah, it's so satisfying.
[75:23.37]Anybody else really feeling that right now?
[75:27.76]Piece number one.
[75:33.13]There's diamonds everywhere.
[75:34.37]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[75:35.49]This is the original clicker.
[75:36.53]Where do you think they got all their ideas from?
[75:43.16]Don't do that again.
[75:44.70]That's getting to a point where you're getting to be pretty dumb.
[75:49.20]Don't!
[75:49.72]All these fish are gonna die!
[75:51.52]Woo!
[75:52.80]Woo!
[75:54.91]That was close.
[76:03.58]Micro management.
[76:06.18]You know, I always knew I had management written all over me.
[76:10.78]I'll clean up that office in just a second.
[76:12.56]You get me in there.
[76:16.43]Type D. It's another one of those rocket launchers.
[76:18.33]I think we're going to lose one of those guys down there.
[76:26.64]No, we're good.
[76:27.30]We're fine.
[76:32.81]I'm just gonna start missing diamonds because too many are coming up.
[76:37.36]7,500 and we are there.
[76:38.84]No, we're not there.
[76:40.36]Almost there.
[76:41.98]Almost there.
[76:42.66]Almost.
[76:43.56]Bingo.
[76:43.96]Level complete.
[76:48.88]Meryl the Mermaid.
[76:51.16]Meryl's song cheers up all the guppies in the tank, making them drop coins faster.
[76:56.83]Oh, I remember this is really good.
[77:01.36]This is crazy.
[77:02.36]Just wait till you see how cool this is.
[77:06.67]She's not naked.
[77:07.57]Stop it.
[77:09.83]Thank you to Yharnam's Tourist Shop for the $5.
[77:15.25]Hey, Jerma.
[77:16.45]I wanted to say thank you for all the content you do.
[77:17.95]You're one of my favorite streamers to put on while I'm working.
[77:21.01]I'm often laughing at my desk in the studio.
[77:23.15]Thank you again for the good times.
[77:24.33]Well, thank you, Yharnam.
[77:26.79]Thank you, Yharnam Tourist Shop for the $5.
[77:29.10]Appreciate that.
[77:32.10]I'm happy to be your background.
[77:36.14]Just let me sit in the background.
[77:38.62]I'll be here.
[77:39.98]I'll be here.
[77:41.56]Thank you so much, though.
[77:42.66]Thank you also to Sly161 for the two bucks.
[77:44.48]Plants vs. Zombies or Feeding Frenzy 2 after you owe 100% Insane Aquarium?
[77:50.43]Nah, I mean, this is just... Nah.
[77:54.01]Plants vs. Zombies is your... Zombies?
[77:56.87]I'm giving myself an accent.
[77:59.31]Plants vs. Zombies is a great game.
[78:01.72]I don't think I would want to play that for... This is kind of an anomaly of a stream.
[78:07.64]Where I knew I didn't have the mental and physical fortitude to do anything else.
[78:11.34]So I'm just sitting here just chilling, playing Insane Aquarium.
[78:14.61]But... I will tell you, those are everyone that's still here.
[78:18.93]We got a bunch of cool shit on tap here.
[78:22.78]Probably not next week, but obviously Monster Hunter is coming out.
[78:25.67]Monster Hunter: World.
[78:26.79]I'm going to be playing that a lot.
[78:28.97]You'll be seeing a lot of that.
[78:30.47]But you're also going to see a ton of Dreamcast.
[78:33.31]Remember when I had the PlayStation 3 stack tower of video games?
[78:37.18]We're going to have a tower of Dreamcast games.
[78:39.10]That's probably going to start in like a week or two.
[78:43.16]So I can't wait to do that.
[78:44.34]Some of these Dreamcast games just are outrageous.
[78:47.86]So that should give us at least a month or two worth of shit to do.
[78:52.02]I used to love the Dreamcast.
[78:55.41]So get ready for that.
[78:58.09]But that's what's on tap here for the next couple of weeks.
[79:00.49]I'd say probably the next month or so.
[79:03.79]And then a couple of surprises.
[79:05.71]Don't think I don't have something up my sleeve.
[79:08.89]It's up there.
[79:09.96]You'll see it soon.
[79:12.01]Alright, but thank you, though.
[79:13.31]Thank you to... Thank you to FlameHawk for the five bucks.
[79:18.11]Hey, Jerma, love your streaming vids.
[79:19.43]Can't wait to see your new main channel projects.
[79:21.89]Keep up the great work.
[79:23.33]Stay tuned, stay tuned, stay tuned.
[79:25.75]Thank you, FlameHawk, for the five bucks.
[79:26.91]Spatial Image, thank you for the $1.
[79:29.78]Jerma985, streamer is idiotus.
[79:33.38]Oh.
[79:34.48]You're doing a Wikipedia fucking Latin thing to me, huh?
[79:37.92]Thank you, though.
[79:38.46]Appreciate it.
[79:39.06]Thank you, Peter the Pete, for the $1.
[79:41.95]SEGA 32X stream when?
[79:44.21]You missed it.
[79:45.31]We did a whole... We did like 20 SEGA CD games.
[79:48.67]Although that's not SEGA 32X, but still.
[79:52.62]This is the last level here.
[79:53.58]We gotta make this one count.
[79:58.16]Streamer is idiotic.
[80:01.34]Did I look at the Doki Doki Literature Club?
[80:03.24]I'm not gonna... I don't... I told you guys, I have a strict no anime game policy on this channel.
[80:09.22]It is strict.
[80:12.50]No anime video games on this channel.
[80:17.14]I can't... I don't make the rules, I just follow them.
[80:22.63]And plus, isn't that just one of those games where you just... Look at how funny it is, I'm gonna... pretend to date people, and it's like, oh, anime girls, I'm gonna pretend to date them.
[80:33.38]Haven't you seen that?
[80:35.26]People have done that shit to death.
[80:38.24]What more could I bring to the table?
[80:43.28]It's spooky.
[80:44.92]That's a dating simulator!
[80:46.18]What are you talking about?
[80:53.10]Change the channel!
[80:57.24]Then why did I play Dark Souls?
[80:59.46]Because Dark Souls is like... The Dark Souls series and Bloodborne are some of my favorite games ever made.
[81:04.76]That's not a fair comparison!
[81:08.38]You can't make that comparison!
[81:11.86]Doki Doki Literature Club is like a funny little stream game.
[81:15.11]Dark Souls, Bloodborne is one of my favorite video games I've ever played in my life.
[81:20.17]I can absolutely guarantee you that if I play Doki Doki Literature Club, it's not going to be my favorite game ever.
[81:32.96]It's a horror game.
[81:35.28]It better be.
[81:36.98]If I buy this game and load it up and put it on stream and it's just like...
[81:41.97]Ask the anime girl questions about her day.
[81:44.10]I'm gonna be real mad at you guys.
[81:48.34]Yeah, Bloodborne is my favorite single-player game ever made.
[81:51.52]It is.
[81:52.64]Look at that.
[81:55.74]That's why you have the lady coming.
[81:57.06]That's why you have her.
[81:58.30]She does that shit.
[82:00.34]It's a free game.
[82:06.51]It's...
[82:10.96]I can't believe you guys tried to make that comparison.
[82:14.98]Comparing Dark Souls to Doki Doki Literature Club.
[82:18.50]I'm fucking offended.
[82:21.98]I am offended by this.
[82:23.40]What do you mean?
[82:32.29]The game's not free?
[82:33.45]Is it free?
[82:40.44]Don't fall for it.
[82:43.16]Dark Souls isn't even that good.
[82:44.54]No, Bloodborne is!
[82:45.46]Oh, what have I done?
[82:46.94]Why did I just say that?
[82:51.46]I just, with that one comment, single-handedly cancered like 400 subscriptions to this channel.
[83:06.27]I think I just... Ah, no, I'm sorry.
[83:07.67]I think I may have just offended everybody here.
[83:11.48]My stomach is fucking killing me.
[83:15.16]We're having like too much fun tonight.
[83:16.86]I'm not supposed to be having any fun.
[83:18.54]I'm supposed to be like sitting back and just silent.
[83:22.12]Look at all those coins!
[83:26.13]Wow.
[83:26.53]Something about seeing that many coins on screen just gets me... No fun allowed.
[83:38.21]Why am I playing this?
[83:41.02]Because... Look, there are a lot of people here now.
[83:45.17]Let's... Hold on.
[83:46.87]Excuse me.
[83:47.31]Hold on, Yoko Shimomura.
[83:48.75]You gotta wait a second.
[83:51.01]I'm playing this game tonight.
[83:52.45]Because if you weren't here before... I've been feeling very, very ill.
[83:56.61]I have an illness.
[83:57.23]I have a disease.
[83:57.95]It's annoying.
[83:58.87]It's stupid.
[83:59.35]It's fucking... We don't have to talk about it.
[84:00.88]We've talked about it before.
[84:02.46]I decided I'm going to have a chill stream tonight.
[84:04.42]No fucking around.
[84:05.24]No screaming.
[84:06.88]I'm not going to do any screaming.
[84:08.14]I'm not going to get agitated.
[84:09.22]I'm not going to start talking loudly and quickly.
[84:11.22]I'm just going to relax.
[84:13.80]Don't need to focus on it.
[84:14.76]I'm just going to play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[84:17.09]I'm going to play Insane Aquarium.
[84:18.83]And we're going to be fine.
[84:21.33]That's what happened.
[84:21.87]That's what's going on.
[84:22.63]We're just hanging out here.
[84:25.11]And bring back John Williams.
[84:29.27]Whatever his name is.
[84:30.29]Hans Williams.
[84:30.61]Hans Williams.
[84:40.67]Doki Doki Literature Club is the Dark Souls of Bloodborne.
[84:48.25]What are you smoking?
[84:49.79]Crack?
[84:52.33]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[84:54.61]Alright, we have enough, I think.
[84:56.55]I need to get everybody to max level.
[84:59.05]This should happen here.
[85:08.40]Ow, my stomach.
[85:09.64]That's so stupid.
[85:11.99]The Dark Souls of Bloodborne.
[85:19.27]That is so loud and there's nothing I can do about it.
[85:21.23]Alright, here we go.
[85:23.45]Let's bring out the potions.
[85:31.87]Is that enough?
[85:32.39]Yep, keep going.
[85:34.61]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[85:35.85]I know you two are going to be hungry.
[85:36.85]Come on, I know.
[85:37.37]You already are.
[85:41.71]Eat it!
[85:43.47]You know, I... Really?
[85:45.05]Are you two... You're going to starve.
[85:47.18]Are you that stupid?
[85:50.42]Last one.
[85:51.12]Got it.
[85:51.62]Okay.
[85:52.88]Now we begin.
[85:54.60]I'm going to spam.
[85:55.70]I'm going to fill as many of these as I can.
[86:00.21]Because remember, when she starts to sing, game over.
[86:05.84]I really should upgrade the... yeah, I'm gonna upgrade the laser once or twice.
[86:12.22]Necessary.
[86:13.54]You just missed all those coins.
[86:14.80]Well, it's because I was busy talking about fucking... Check that out.
[86:17.80]Look at that.
[86:18.08]Look at all those stars.
[86:18.80]Imagine if you could be as quick as me to pick up all these things.
[86:29.51]In fact, you know, imagine if you could be as quick as me
[86:33.99]The dev of Doki Doki is in the chat.
[86:38.17]That's a lie.
[86:40.03]Why would that person be here right now?
[86:46.31]Yeah.
[86:47.31]The dev of Doki Doki Literature Club fucking loves Insane Aquarium.
[86:51.61]It's his favorite video game ever.
[86:52.92]He based Doki Doki Literature Club on this game.
[86:59.48]I made this game.
[87:01.42]Nice.
[87:01.64]Hey, what's up, man?
[87:07.34]More, more, more.
[87:08.84]We need $10,000.
[87:09.26]We need $30,000.
[87:10.08]Might take a little while.
[87:16.57]Are you guys going to start doing copy-pasta-doki-doki shit here?
[87:19.73]I made this game.
[87:28.42]The Boy Who Cried Wolf.
[87:31.72]Just fills this whole situation.
[87:33.70]Didn't this happen to me before?
[87:36.64]Somebody pretended to be Blue Apron and I believed them and I gave Blue Apron a shout out on the stream and was super, super embarrassed and shit because I thought that was actually real.
[87:46.26]And I got played the whole stream.
[87:49.89]I remember that.
[87:53.97]I'm never going to trust a dev in chat ever again.
[87:58.17]That person's name was Blue Apron.
[88:00.29]Official Blue Apron.
[88:03.58]How... At what point do the trolls get so good they can have official next to their name?
[88:08.70]Are people going to start faking verified tags?
[88:19.47]Really, the moral of the story here is just don't talk to strangers online.
[88:23.95]Unless they're me.
[88:25.56]Then that's okay.
[88:29.86]You know, if you talk to me, that's fine.
[88:31.22]I mean, I am a stranger, but I'm, you know, I'm okay.
[88:35.63]Bennett Foddy is in the chat right now.
[88:39.73]Is he now?
[88:44.74]First piece, and then we're gonna move on to the next tank.
[88:47.06]My favorite tank, from what I remember.
[88:54.20]Alright, let me ask you this.
[88:54.99]Those of you guys that keep talking about Doki Doki Literature Club.
[88:58.09]And I keep saying the full name as if this is an advertisement for that game.
[89:03.11]So let me ask you a couple of questions about Doki Doki Literature Club.
[89:05.75]You know what I'm saying, guys?
[89:07.62]In Doki Doki Literature Club... In actuality, though, for real, is that just like a choose dialog to a...
[89:18.33]Is this a choose dialog options to the same four or five anime girl picture?
[89:27.18]Tell me if that's incorrect or not.
[89:34.19]No.
[89:34.99]Yes, it is.
[89:38.13]Yes and no.
[89:40.41]So we have smiling anime girl.
[89:44.61]Blushing anime girl.
[89:46.57]These are all separate just images of this person.
[89:50.62]Shocked anime girl.
[89:52.68]Annoyed anime girl.
[89:54.83]And sad anime girl.
[89:56.53]And then default anime girl face.
[89:59.05]Those are the five images that are in that game.
[90:02.00]And then you just, you answer with a various amount of questions.
[90:06.12]And also, they don't, there's no voice acting.
[90:08.58]It's just every so often they go, Is that what I'm looking at here?
[90:14.39]Is that what I'm, is that the kind of content I'm looking at here?
[90:26.51]Yes.
[90:27.71]That's it?
[90:28.45]That's pretty much it?
[90:30.51]Okay.
[90:31.97]Well then no, I'm not going to play it.
[90:35.35]Where's the music?
[90:36.01]10,000!
[90:41.00]10,000 here!
[90:43.76]10,000 there!
[90:55.03]If you don't play it, I will never watch this stream again.
[90:57.60]Did you say that?
[90:58.14]Or did you say if I do play it, you will never watch this stream?
[91:01.32]This is like where it's hard... Hold on, I gotta rob it.
[91:13.74]Look at that, look at that.
[91:14.54]Look at all the stars there.
[91:18.74]Lovely.
[91:20.56]So, some people, and by some people I mean most,
[91:25.63]If I... Okay, let's say I play a game that somebody hates.
[91:28.03]First of all, let's open this.
[91:34.62]Wadsworth the Whale.
[91:36.82]Wadsworth helps by sheltering your baby and medium guppies from hungry aliens.
[91:42.32]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[92:09.44]Almost got them all.
[92:12.14]See, I only need 20 more thousand of those.
[92:16.04]Alright, Wadsworth is pretty good.
[92:20.72]Thank you, Lord Walden.
[92:22.42]Hey, Lord Walden, welcome back.
[92:23.64]Thanks for the five bucks.
[92:25.71]I don't know, what are you saying here?
[92:33.95]Thanks for the $5.
[92:35.80]Thank you Hasnain for the $1.
[92:37.18]Streamer pisses off whole entire anime community on stream.
[92:41.50]I didn't say anime sucks.
[92:43.04]When did I say that?
[92:44.68]I never said that.
[92:47.14]I enjoy some animated features.
[92:53.61]I've seen Dragon Ball.
[92:56.77]The original.
[92:59.35]I've seen the Fullmetal Alchemist of Brothers.
[93:02.85]I've seen those animated features.
[93:06.03]They were very good.
[93:09.24]Thank you, Parsnips, for the $1.
[93:10.56]If you aren't playing Doki... If you aren't going to play Doki Doki, would you consider Orange Box TF2?
[93:18.52]The Orange Box version of the TF2.
[93:20.06]You want to get it for PlayStation 3?
[93:22.51]Want me to go buy the PS3 TF2 version and still do the wrench guaranteed crit glitch?
[93:28.17]That still exists in that game?
[93:29.49]If even the servers are still online?
[93:33.00]Thanks, though.
[93:34.07]Thank you also Travelboy22 for the $1.
[93:35.93]Doki Doki Literature Club is a joke game where they make fourth wall jokes.
[93:41.86]And you have to edit game files.
[93:45.80]Oh.
[93:46.84]Well, whatever.
[93:48.66]Thank you Jerma985Official for the $1.
[93:50.76]See, the problem is you don't have one of these next to your name.
[93:54.74]I can't do it.
[93:55.16]The game crashed.
[93:56.64]Thanks for the $1 donation.
[93:57.96]Hey kid, been watching you for a while.
[93:59.28]I'm flattered I inspired you.
[94:01.84]And maybe one day you can grow to be something greater than me.
[94:04.24]Your friend, jermaOn 8-5.
[94:08.48]Bruin.
[94:08.86]Did I just bruin the whole game?
[94:13.18]Wait, did somebody just spoil the whole game for me?
[94:20.39]Ow.
[94:23.74]Ah, fuck.
[94:24.90]I can't laugh at this.
[94:25.88]I'm so sorry.
[94:27.40]Well, now I know how to play the game.
[94:29.26]The game's fun.
[94:30.24]That was a fun game.
[94:33.34]Oh, let's stick with... No, not the pearl.
[94:36.19]Let's get the knife.
[94:39.19]Here we go, new tank.
[94:46.55]Alright, wait a minute.
[94:47.35]Wait a minute.
[94:47.83]Let's make another comparison here.
[94:50.69]Doki Doki Literature Club...
[94:53.75]Undertale question mark You see I'm trying to tell you Doki Doki literature club a dash comma Undertale question mark one of those type is We yeah No
[95:19.47]Like I said, hold on, you and I are sitting in a bar, and we're sharing a nice, like, cold one together.
[95:25.26]And, uh, somebody brings up Doki Doki, so the bartender's like, oh man, you gotta play this game, it's called Doki Doki Literature Club.
[95:31.62]And then you turn to me, and I'm like, what the fuck is that?
[95:34.57]And you go, Undertale, and you kinda like, you elbow me in the chest a little bit, and you're like, Undertale, dude.
[95:40.97]And I'm like, oh, okay, I got ya, alright, I'll play it, sure thing.
[95:45.17]No?
[95:47.06]No?
[95:53.51]Guppy Cruncher!
[95:56.30]I think I made a video here.
[96:01.72]Enemy approaching.
[96:02.34]This is a new... Nope, just regular one.
[96:06.90]He died instantly.
[96:07.67]Uh, so I believe I made a video.
[96:11.43]My third video I ever made... ...was here.
[96:16.11]This is bringing back some nostalgia for me.
[96:19.18]I did a pretend grandpa video.
[96:22.56]I still, I really only, I truly only believe, I think, like, I think that video has, like, 8,000 views.
[96:29.97]Like, nobody has gone back to watch that video in the last, like, seven years.
[96:35.74]And I, you know, I know that because I remember I go, you put it where you do it, you get the guppy cruncher.
[96:40.48]Right?
[96:41.65]Somebody go watch it and tell me.
[96:50.31]Isn't it like 15 minutes long?
[96:52.09]It's too long, too.
[96:56.37]I think you need to get... Yeah, they jump up and eat them.
[97:00.44]I'm pretty sure they do, at least.
[97:05.34]No, they have to come down.
[97:06.40]I remember this.
[97:07.74]Yeah, they have to come all the way down to a low enough level where they can be bit.
[97:13.42]Right?
[97:15.09]Right?
[97:16.27]Right?
[97:16.49]There it is.
[97:17.37]Okay, yeah.
[97:18.33]So they have to eat these little guys, but the little guys have to be dragged down here.
[97:22.86]Oh, this I forget.
[97:23.42]This is a pain in the ass.
[97:26.36]And then they shit out the beetles.
[97:31.28]Do not eat that guy, thank you.
[97:37.31]Yeah, you have to feed, trail them all the way down here.
[97:41.79]For the guppy crunches to do it.
[97:44.61]Play Warframe.
[97:45.85]I'm not too keen on Warframe.
[97:50.14]Warframe's not really my kind of game.
[97:54.56]I'm more of a strategy and tabletop and RP gamer, you know what I mean?
[98:01.13]I'm more into games like Civilization and games that require large amounts of time investment in strategy and studying.
[98:11.73]I'm not sure I'd be into that.
[98:13.97]Is there violence in that game?
[98:20.76]I'm not sure I would enjoy it.
[98:27.27]I'm more into playing things like Cosmic Encounter, the board game.
[98:30.67]No violence in that game.
[98:36.55]There we go.
[98:37.73]Spam it, please.
[98:43.77]I love how that's... This is going to be the new thing that everybody just doesn't stop saying, huh?
[98:49.27]The D word?
[98:49.75]The D word book club?
[98:54.54]Is that the only thing everyone's going to... That's it?
[98:55.94]That's it, huh?
[99:00.68]Warning, my Guppy Cruncher has died.
[99:02.14]Oh, shit.
[99:05.68]Get down there, come on.
[99:08.62]Get down there!
[99:09.23]I'm gonna beat this whole game on stream tonight, probably, you understand?
[99:14.95]This is a nice, relaxing game.
[99:19.21]One more!
[99:30.97]The D word is... What?
[99:34.05]Ding dong?
[99:34.65]No, the D word is... I don't want to say it.
[99:40.12]I'm going to get in trouble if I say the D word.
[99:41.84]Okay, I'm going to say it.
[99:46.04]But just don't report me or anything.
[99:48.14]Don't get mad at me.
[99:49.08]I'm going to get in a lot of trouble and my dad's going to kill me.
[99:54.62]But, like, there's a lot of people here.
[99:55.78]There's tons of people here that are watching.
[99:57.78]They, like, expect me to say it, and they're under pressure to say it.
[100:01.28]Please don't get mad at me, Dad.
[100:06.70]Damn it.
[100:07.72]Don't tell him.
[100:08.52]Don't tell my dad, please.
[100:15.26]Don't tell my dad.
[100:16.58]Seymour!
[100:17.22]Seymour's presence makes all coins and diamonds drift at a slower rate.
[100:24.81]That's good.
[100:25.65]Especially when you have these two work together.
[100:27.55]This is a very good synergy.
[100:30.27]Drops coins a ton faster and now they're much slower.
[100:33.21]And we're also going to keep Rufus because he's great.
[100:37.46]Hey, BubberDuck, thanks for the 25 cents.
[100:39.24]Kappa.
[100:40.36]ReptilianGod, thanks for the $1.
[100:41.44]No, that's not $1.
[100:42.76]That's $10.
[100:43.36]Thank you, Reptilian.
[100:46.34]If you're not going to play the book club game, at least watch your Grandpa Modern Warfare 3 video on stream.
[100:53.45]Absolutely not.
[100:58.43]I can't.
[100:59.71]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1.
[101:01.20]Damn Daniel Dabbed.
[101:03.56]Ducking dickhead.
[101:06.90]Wait, is that damn Daniel?
[101:08.22]Like, damn Daniel, the guy with the shoes?
[101:12.87]I don't... Look, memes just go over my head now.
[101:16.29]I'm too old.
[101:18.51]Damn Daniel, right?
[101:19.71]He had, like, nice shoes on.
[101:20.75]I didn't even give a shit.
[101:24.41]I didn't even know what that was, and I didn't even care to look.
[101:27.82]You know how easy it would be for me to type into Google, damn Daniel, and press enter?
[101:34.57]That, even that effort, was too much for me, because I didn't fucking care.
[101:44.37]Everyone, all you guys have, all you skips have these memes, and I don't even have the wherewithal to type them into Google.
[101:51.63]I found out about the new memes from you guys, and then I asked you about them.
[102:04.27]I miss Grandpa.
[102:05.17]He had a lot of videos.
[102:10.21]Grandpa was a part of like 50 videos.
[102:12.94]It's not like I did it once and never did it again.
[102:17.56]I like this team.
[102:18.16]I'm going to go with this team.
[102:22.16]Thank you also to Emerald Duber, or Emerald Duber, thanks for the 25 cents.
[102:26.05]I'd rather you just play it on your own time.
[102:27.97]The chat would keep you too relaxed.
[102:32.85]Oobree!
[102:33.37]Thank you, Oobree, for the 10 bucks.
[102:35.77]Hey, Jerm, I've been following you for years and have never been disappointed.
[102:38.74]Do you think playing through the Hotline Miami's would be a good stream idea?
[102:44.68]You know, I actually was thinking about Hotline Miami.
[102:49.16]Just to have as a sort of in-between game over the next month or so.
[102:54.06]I feel like I would get really frustrated at Hotline Miami, though.
[102:57.18]Just because of its very nature.
[103:02.75]But, yeah.
[103:03.85]Definitely something to think about.
[103:04.71]Thank you, though.
[103:08.09]Thanks a lot, man.
[103:09.79]Uh, thank you.
[103:10.55]SSBM Icarus.
[103:11.79]Super Smash Brothers Brawl Icarus.
[103:15.23]For your five dollars.
[103:16.01]When will you eat a... Tide... Tide... Tide pole.
[103:20.09]Tide... What the hell are you... What are you saying?
[103:22.00]Tide... A tadpole on stream?
[103:26.20]No, I'm not, like, eating any animals on stream.
[103:28.20]I'm not gonna do that.
[103:31.48]Thank you, though.
[103:34.28]Uh, type G. Oh shit, this is a food guy.
[103:37.06]Oh no.
[103:37.78]This is gonna be hard to do with just one pellet.
[103:41.76]Oh boy.
[103:42.46]Say goodbye.
[103:44.84]Keep him down here.
[103:46.46]Nooo!
[103:47.40]He's gonna kill everybody.
[103:49.52]Oh wow, that sucked.
[103:51.50]Okay, well, we now- I gotta get more food as soon as possible.
[103:57.54]Eat a tide pot?
[103:58.70]What does that even mean?
[104:00.70]Is that like an English bedpan?
[104:03.42]Oh, make sure you eat the tide pot.
[104:05.46]There, the thing that we shit in when you're in the hospital.
[104:08.62]Bedpan?
[104:10.13]What's a bedpan?
[104:11.59]It's a fucking tide pot.
[104:13.95]Is that one of those kind of... I'm almost running out of money to feed anybody.
[104:23.26]This is bad.
[104:24.12]Okay, please.
[104:32.80]I think this might be a dead run.
[104:34.84]Am I ever going to have enough money to buy another food upgrade?
[104:39.32]Because I'm going to keep having to use it like this.
[104:42.38]This might be a dead... This might be a dead run.
[104:47.49]It's a package of laundry detergent that people are actually eating.
[104:50.35]What the fuck are you guys even doing anymore?
[104:57.80]Wait, you're talking about the tied laundry packets?
[105:03.63]Those condensed concentrated Tide laundry detergents.
[105:08.83]People are fucking eating those?
[105:11.36]Shut the fuck up.
[105:12.50]Don't even tell me that's what... Really?
[105:17.50]So wait, are we that starved for making content on like YouTube and Twitch now that we have to eat laundry detergent for viewers?
[105:28.23]That's not what's happening.
[105:30.13]I refuse to participate.
[105:37.44]Why would you do that?
[105:39.32]Hey, guys, hey!
[105:40.36]Yo, hey!
[105:41.12]Hold on, this isn't... Uh, the game's gonna crash, but... No, hi, guys, this is important!
[105:52.28]I'm gonna use this music.
[105:54.04]Just pretend this is a YouTube video.
[106:01.20]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[106:02.21]What's going on?
[106:03.45]Crazy Files, it's me!
[106:05.95]Bill Crazy!
[106:07.61]You know me as the fucking craziest guy on YouTube.
[106:10.79]We do crazy shit.
[106:11.85]We go out.
[106:12.91]We get fucked up.
[106:13.89]We do crazy.
[106:14.63]But this time, what am I doing?
[106:16.03]I'm gonna poison myself to death on this video.
[106:19.63]I'm gonna eat laundry detergent.
[106:22.18]Yo, if you could like and support the video for Bill Crazy and the Crazy Files, do it today.
[106:28.70]Okay, let's eat it.
[106:31.27]Oh, wow, whoa, dude, this is fucked up.
[106:33.87]Are you feeling fucked up, Gary?
[106:35.79]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[106:37.37]I can't believe we ate poison together.
[106:40.05]Yeah, man, you're like my Juliet to my Romeo.
[106:42.83]Yeah, this is fucking cool.
[106:44.89]Yeah, hey, kids, isn't eating poison funny?
[106:48.24]Isn't this crazy music?
[106:57.58]What happened?
[106:58.56]How did we get here?
[106:59.88]We couldn't have gotten here.
[107:00.84]How did we do that?
[107:05.34]How the fuck did we even get here?
[107:17.30]Hey, watch out next week!
[107:19.30]You're never gonna fucking believe what we do next week!
[107:21.90]Gary!
[107:22.90]Gary, the man Gary!
[107:24.28]That's me!
[107:25.22]That's right!
[107:25.88]He's gonna run me over with his car next week!
[107:28.95]It's gonna be fucking tapped, man!
[107:31.03]Make sure you subscribe and like!
[107:32.71]Cause I'm gonna get run over by an actual fucking car text time!
[107:37.59]And then they fucking show him, he's like lying on the ground.
[107:40.63]Gary's in there smoking a cigar and he puts it into fucking fourth gear and steps on the gas and like runs over his fucking chest.
[107:48.64]And he's lying there like, and he's like puking up blood.
[107:53.12]And then like fucking guitar riffs play in the background.
[107:55.28]He's like, yo man, make sure you stick around for the next video.
[107:57.92]I'm going to skydive without a parachute.
[108:02.19]And the guy makes like four videos and he's gone.
[108:05.51]How many fucking crazy Bill, Bill crazies are we going to have?
[108:21.21]Dude makes fucking four videos and he's dead!
[108:33.74]That's why he's Bill crazy.
[108:42.39]I don't know why everybody thinks that like to make to be like make like YouTube videos or like stream
[108:48.02]Just try to make content that you think is fun and that you would want to watch with your friends.
[108:55.42]You know what I mean?
[108:55.94]You don't have to fucking eat poison on camera.
[108:59.66]You don't have to do that.
[109:02.46]You don't have to destroy your body.
[109:08.44]Because then you start one-upping yourself and eventually crazy Bill Crazy decides he's like, Hey man, on this week's episode...
[109:16.61]Oh, this music doesn't fit.
[109:18.01]I have to... Hold on.
[109:18.81]I'm sorry.
[109:21.05]We have to do this.
[109:23.21]The game's gonna crash.
[109:24.05]Let me just get... I'm gonna do this after this level.
[109:29.59]Because this is important to me.
[109:31.85]I'm not gonna use this music.
[109:42.25]Alright, so then the difference here is these guys eat the beetles that these guys spit up.
[109:46.07]It's an entire living ecosystem.
[109:50.79]Oh, shit.
[109:51.69]Down here.
[109:52.09]Come on.
[109:52.65]Down here.
[109:53.29]Oh, he's dead.
[109:53.73]That was close.
[109:57.05]That was really close.
[109:59.05]I think... I don't have an... I better be careful here.
[110:01.55]And then he's going to shit out a diamond?
[110:04.01]Or I think it's a gold orb, actually.
[110:08.18]Yep.
[110:08.98]It's worth a lot of money.
[110:14.65]Do not click the beetles, except... Come on, get it.
[110:18.81]You missed it!
[110:19.45]How could you be that dumb?
[110:23.29]That was almost a disaster.
[110:24.56]I need more of these.
[110:29.88]Type G, fuck.
[110:31.90]I need another one, come on.
[110:33.16]Where's it going, where's it going, where's it going?
[110:39.59]We're fine.
[110:43.19]You guys, we're gonna do like a YouTube video.
[110:48.31]Alright, now I gotta actually be careful.
[110:56.70]Do I have enough for another Guppy Cruncher?
[110:58.76]Not yet.
[111:01.60]Feed the Crunchers.
[111:09.18]One more.
[111:09.82]Okay, we're good.
[111:13.50]Can I be in it?
[111:16.20]No, you can't be in my YouTube video, man.
[111:24.35]Feed, feed, feed.
[111:25.93]Almost missed a pearl.
[111:26.65]That would have been a disaster.
[111:39.89]This is fucking... I'm just laughing at fucking YouTube.
[111:47.59]Fucking YouTube.
[111:50.80]Didn't they just like redo the partner agreement too?
[111:53.02]Hey YouTube, maybe you need to update the partner agreement to say don't drink poison.
[112:06.44]He just killed everybody.
[112:08.87]That's annoying.
[112:10.01]Oh, I'm so annoyed right now.
[112:16.57]He's in deep shit.
[112:18.15]Everybody is.
[112:18.66]Let's hope they can get to 5,000 before this goes completely terribly wrong.
[112:26.00]I lured him there.
[112:26.84]I had to!
[112:27.38]Only two more pieces.
[112:33.30]We're good.
[112:38.30]wow I almost just that would have been terrible what is the stank game what is that are you trying to say this is like a cool game and it's like stanky like it's a good stanky game or are you saying this is a bad game well it's alright here we go shrapnel the robot fish shrapnel drops bombs that blow up fish on contact but give lots of cash when clicked
[113:07.90]So he has a... This guy's... I don't like using this guy.
[113:11.10]He has a lot of potential to just kill everybody in the tank.
[113:14.56]Even though it's worth a lot of money.
[113:16.66]Alright, give me one second.
[113:18.16]I want to... Let's quit out of this.
[113:23.81]Because I have to do this.
[113:26.03]Stop the insanity.
[113:28.19]Okay, so let me just do this really quickly.
[113:29.89]I have to make this joke.
[113:35.11]So just give me one second.
[113:35.97]I'll be right back.
[117:20.79]Okay.
[117:21.91]Let's go ahead and get this ready.
[117:25.19]I had to do this.
[117:40.56]Okay.
[117:43.00]So let's watch Bill Crazy's new video and see how it is.
[117:56.93]Hey, what's going on, Crazy Files?
[117:58.65]It's me, Crazy Bill Crazy!
[118:01.38]Yeah!
[118:01.72]I'm here with another video, here with always, Gary the Fuck-Up!
[118:05.12]It's me, Gary the Fuck-Up!
[118:06.38]And today, as you see, I'm sitting in a pool of water!
[118:10.69]Water!
[118:11.07]And what water it is!
[118:12.15]That's right, motherfucker!
[118:13.57]And what's gonna happen here today...
[118:15.49]Gary is going to drop a toaster in here.
[118:18.28]I'm going to see how long I can last.
[118:20.24]It's going to hurt like a bitch, you know what I mean?
[118:23.80]Can't wait.
[118:25.02]Yeah, Gary, I'm ready.
[118:26.84]Throw it in there.
[118:28.00]Make sure you like this.
[118:29.65]Whoa, that was crazy.
[118:33.37]That was crazy.
[118:50.77]It's crazy.
[118:57.19]There you go.
[118:57.89]That's what I had to do.
[119:00.50]Be sure to like, he's just, no, that's just it.
[119:03.00]It's a 40 second video.
[119:04.22]He's just, he dies.
[119:06.74]And then like the shitty vertical cell phone video turns off right there.
[119:15.27]Fucking, oh, the crazy files and Bill Crazy.
[119:22.97]It's like shit audio.
[119:24.25]I was picking up my webcam.
[119:26.93]Whoops.
[119:31.48]Alright, we're playing a fish game.
[119:32.98]Let's go back to the fish game.
[119:41.86]Why did he say, wow, that was crazy if he just died?
[119:44.46]Because it was crazy.
[119:46.14]He couldn't believe it.
[119:48.12]He was like, wow, that was crazy.
[119:55.02]Okay, let's go.
[119:56.80]I have to re-open the game.
[120:05.41]At least, okay, I got to the end.
[120:07.33]That's all I care about.
[120:10.71]I got to the end of that level.
[120:11.75]Let's keep going.
[120:20.30]And we're back.
[120:21.70]No, the game crashed.
[120:22.88]Whoopsie daisy.
[120:24.49]Let's try this again.
[120:28.21]Whoops.
[120:34.29]Yeah, that was Gary the Fuck-Up and Bill Crazy.
[120:40.69]Play a good game for once?
[120:42.11]This is a great game.
[120:43.19]Oh, fuck.
[120:50.05]Hold on.
[120:53.71]There we go.
[120:55.48]No!
[120:56.14]The fucking game crashed again.
[120:59.77]Why are you doing this to me?
[121:00.97]I have to beat this.
[121:05.43]I have a game to beat.
[121:08.03]It's super mondo important.
[121:15.89]Come on.
[121:16.39]What the fuck is going on?
[121:19.84]Stop it.
[121:26.49]I did, I had to like alt tab and close the game to do like the Bill crazy thing.
[121:31.83]And now all of a sudden the game doesn't even, I can't even get the game to work for more than five seconds.
[121:39.55]Okay, we're gonna try this again.
[121:42.73]Please tell me that you can see the game.
[121:45.11]Can you see the game?
[121:52.53]Can we see it?
[121:54.31]Are we good?
[121:55.92]Thank you, Jesus.
[121:57.14]Alright, back to the adventure.
[122:06.24]Type pod dev in chat.
[122:08.72]No, I wanna do this completely legally.
[122:12.13]I don't wanna do this illegally.
[122:13.21]Those were his last words.
[122:23.57]I like this trio.
[122:27.62]I've only got one more tank after this.
[122:33.10]Why did you stream desynced?
[122:34.96]I don't know.
[122:36.25]Thank you Scripps3 for the 1000 bits for the 10 bucks.
[122:38.87]Appreciate that.
[122:40.53]You should get Deponia on stream.
[122:42.47]It's a fun, wacky point and click game and the spiritual successor to Monkey Island.
[122:48.19]You would love it.
[122:48.71]Also greetings from Portugal.
[122:51.05]Greetings.
[122:52.79]Thank you Scripps.
[122:54.37]I will check it out after the stream for sure.
[122:57.01]Thank you so much.
[123:00.17]Well, that was Bill Crazy's, like, death right there.
[123:03.00]I just thought that was playing again.
[123:07.94]Deponia is good.
[123:08.90]I'll check it out, for sure.
[123:15.04]Also, thank you to... Sawdust Bunnies.
[123:19.27]Hasnain for the $1.
[123:21.35]Mostly lost for the $1.
[123:23.01]You seriously went through the time to record all that shit.
[123:26.14]Well, that didn't take very long.
[123:28.62]That took as long as I was at the VRB screen.
[123:33.54]I mean, I just muted the mic and muted the desktop audio, and it took like two, three minutes?
[123:39.66]Less than five minutes?
[123:45.50]Type P, oh no.
[123:46.84]I think this is where it gets ugly.
[123:49.71]Yes, this stupid fucking art.
[123:51.27]Thank you, Octopus, so much.
[123:56.60]Yeah, the octopus, he turns himself off, and if you shoot him, he regains health, but he just flies around anyways.
[124:01.89]That's the worst one we've ever done.
[124:09.15]I hate the octopus with a passion.
[124:15.31]Tide Pod Alien.
[124:24.64]I need to do... Yeah, I need to do...
[124:27.71]I need to be able to do two at the same time.
[124:30.23]It's a big crazy, big wow.
[124:34.10]I'll thank you too.
[124:35.70]Sticks Renegade for the one dollar.
[124:37.34]Appreciate that, Sticks.
[124:41.86]Build Crazy for the next Rumble.
[124:43.96]Well, it depends.
[124:46.95]I don't know if he's a sticking character here.
[124:52.77]He might be.
[124:56.80]I don't know if Bill Crazy is a character that's gonna stick.
[125:10.78]Get those beetles.
[125:13.22]He's as good as any.
[125:14.36]He's like better than half the fucking stupid things that we say in this chat and on the screen.
[125:24.48]Another one of these stupid idiots.
[125:25.80]I need to actually level up the gun.
[125:28.52]That's top priority with a Type P alien.
[125:36.80]Don't come all the way over here, please.
[125:39.51]I have to move him.
[125:40.63]No!
[125:41.85]This is bad.
[125:42.43]Please get over here and hit him.
[125:51.97]Bring the guppies down.
[125:54.78]Yeah, Billcrazy could just die in every rumble.
[125:56.86]I'll just make sure something horrible happens to him every time.
[126:09.09]Tag team Bill and Gary.
[126:10.61]You know, that could work.
[126:16.51]Although, like, it would have to be in 2k14.
[126:21.17]I can't make any fake scripted events in the latest ones.
[126:27.97]In like 2K17, 2K18, those games are just awful.
[126:33.35]How could you go so wrong making like a fun wrestling game?
[126:36.01]I don't know how you fuck that up that badly.
[126:39.07]Oh, I actually know how you fuck that up.
[126:41.72]You turn a fun fake theatrical performance, which is wrestling, into a real serious sports simulation video game.
[126:52.28]2K started treating wrestling like fucking madness.
[126:58.22]Yeah, that's what people want.
[126:59.32]People want a realistic sports simulation game.
[127:02.56]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[127:04.84]I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna spawn anybody yet.
[127:17.90]Get away.
[127:18.50]Why are you over here?
[127:19.31]Why are you all flocking over here?
[127:24.17]There's no reason to flock over here right now.
[127:25.63]You're idiots.
[127:32.38]Die, please!
[127:42.45]Realistic.
[127:45.63]That guy's gonna die.
[127:46.45]Down, down, down, down!
[127:50.31]Becoming invested.
[127:57.22]So many things to click on in so little time.
[128:07.09]Stinky would be good for this tank.
[128:08.33]Yeah, he would.
[128:10.93]You are right there.
[128:17.75]You know what?
[128:18.05]Stinky would be great.
[128:19.17]And, um... What's the other one that I want to do?
[128:25.59]Stinky!
[128:28.27]Yeah, this is where concentration is key.
[128:30.44]Especially in these last couple of tanks.
[128:33.48]It's all about clicking and holding, clicking and holding, clicking and holding.
[128:40.46]Alright, now I gotta be careful.
[128:43.82]I just have to keep the copycrunchers down here.
[128:50.56]There.
[128:50.72]Lots of going without food.
[128:51.90]Come on.
[128:53.66]Give me, give me, give me.
[128:55.65]Got it.
[128:58.48]Bad.
[128:58.72]They're all spread out.
[128:59.40]Bad, bad, bad.
[129:00.22]Well, we just killed like fucking three people.
[129:05.41]I hate this thing.
[129:07.33]I hate you.
[129:08.87]Because now I can't feed anybody and they can die like this.
[129:11.45]It's just bad.
[129:13.75]Ah, shit.
[129:20.19]Sorry, Gary.
[129:22.33]Bill Crazy keeps getting zapped.
[129:30.34]Yeah, they one-shot everything, unfortunately.
[129:33.46]It's not cool.
[129:39.56]Do I still need to feed you guys?
[129:41.26]Wow, you still need to be fed?
[129:42.62]How many do I have down here?
[129:44.02]Why isn't that many?
[129:51.71]Now I have too many.
[129:54.49]Micromanagement skills are lacking tonight.
[129:58.86]Micro-management skills!
[130:04.16]Any more guppies?
[130:08.56]They're taking too many pills.
[130:15.56]Just an absolute frenzy of clicking.
[130:17.22]We're talking about an absolute click frenzy.
[130:29.69]Shit, there's too many.
[130:31.89]No, give me some more power.
[130:35.47]I still haven't got one piece of that.
[130:38.67]Oh my god, a disaster.
[130:43.21]Disaster.
[130:44.23]That's a fucking disaster.
[130:46.49]Stop it, get back over here.
[130:48.19]I don't even care if you heal.
[130:50.54]Oh my god!
[130:59.78]No!
[131:03.39]Back to square one.
[131:04.49]Great.
[131:09.41]I'm so angry right now.
[131:10.87]He just killed fucking everybody.
[131:15.36]Just need to focus on getting these guys back.
[131:17.26]Ah, it's so irritating.
[131:24.48]Crazy, crazy pill.
[131:26.44]No, it's not crazy pill.
[131:27.74]That's like the fucking pop cap.
[131:30.42]It's pill crazy.
[131:33.89]I have to get some actual attraction here.
[131:41.79]Very quickly now, quickly now.
[131:43.47]One more will do it.
[131:50.38]Alright, now I'm gonna make some money.
[131:57.32]You know what's really funny?
[132:05.29]If you ever want to laugh... I'm pretty sure you've probably heard your cat or dog do this before.
[132:12.53]But make somebody laugh while they're eating.
[132:15.25]When they're chewing on something, just try to make them laugh while they're chewing.
[132:18.47]Especially if you know your friend is a really loud, obnoxious, mouth-opening mouth-chewer.
[132:26.22]As we get in the laugh, then they start going like this.
[132:36.05]It's really funny.
[132:36.75]Like, you know when your cat is really mad at you and you lean in?
[132:45.54]And you're petting your cat while she's eating and she's like...
[132:52.17]Or like your dog, if your dog is eating something and you happen to have one of those dogs that gets really annoyed if you're standing near him while they're eating and they're like... You guys don't know that?
[133:07.67]What are you talking about?
[133:08.49]Somebody knows what I mean.
[133:14.46]If you have a friend or an animal that talks while they're eating...
[133:23.56]How do you not understand this?
[133:33.69]Just like that, we're done with the level, boys and girls.
[133:42.64]Just spam on the whole screen, we do.
[133:56.02]Come on, before the alien gets here, please!
[133:59.82]Alright, so this is what I was trying to say.
[134:02.50]So, well first let's talk about Gumbo the Angler.
[134:06.46]So he's really great because he pulls everybody away from the aliens.
[134:10.52]When there's an attack.
[134:12.96]So he's very useful.
[134:13.71]Almost more useful than this.
[134:16.21]But what I mean is what I was trying to say.
[134:19.46]Like, if you have a cat that's eating, sometimes cats just get annoyed at anything.
[134:27.11]I've had, over the course of my life, I've probably had in my family and just in my house, probably like 10 cats, like 8 cats over like 25 years.
[134:37.48]Something like that.
[134:38.46]That have gone on to various houses.
[134:41.08]And when they eat, another cat would walk by.
[134:43.92]If you have more than one or two cats in the house.
[134:46.96]Cat 1 face down eating.
[134:48.47]Cat 2 curious about Cat 1 eating.
[134:51.25]Walks over.
[134:52.35]Cat 1 upset about Cat 2 walking over while Cat 1 is eating.
[134:56.57]Cat 3 then shows up, walks behind Cat 2, curious about the situation between Cat 1 and Cat 2.
[135:02.39]Cat 4 is currently watching Cat 1, tries to find the opportunity for Cat 1 to get away from the food so Cat 1 and Cat 2 can then move away while Cat 4 begins to eat.
[135:13.11]So what I mean here is Cat 4 then starts to go like this.
[135:17.98]And then when they open their mouth, it's really, really easy to follow.
[135:22.78]Just listen to me.
[135:29.71]I like these.
[135:31.27]Where did Cat 3 go?
[135:45.40]Have you guys... I'm just fucking around.
[135:47.32]Has anybody figured this out?
[135:48.56]I hope none of you guys are loud eaters.
[135:54.61]That drives me nuts.
[136:04.65]Lies?
[136:09.12]It's nothing worse than a loud fucking eater, man.
[136:11.90]Especially at a barbecue when everyone's talking.
[136:16.28]You know, listen, we're going to bring this up because this is... We talk about dating sometimes.
[136:20.31]Let me give you some dating advice.
[136:23.99]Didn't we talk about this before?
[136:25.31]Let's just do it.
[136:26.81]Why, in the name of God...
[136:30.25]do we decide that a place that we're going to have potentially first or second dates is eating food at a restaurant?
[136:39.86]Think about that.
[136:41.26]The thing that is wicked embarrassing that you don't want people to see you do, I don't like when people watch me eat.
[136:46.76]So you have to sit there and eat food on a date with somebody that you're not necessarily comfortable with and eat and talk to them.
[136:52.82]You're supposed to, because you're supposed to connect and talk on a date, right?
[136:56.38]So you're sitting there eating like a fucking steak.
[136:59.08]Oh, so where'd you go to school?
[137:00.86]Well, I'm cutting with my hand, putting the steak in my mouth.
[137:04.00]Well, you know, I went to college.
[137:08.95]Excuse me.
[137:10.69]I went to college, uh, up here and it was really, really interesting.
[137:14.06]By the way, she's now eating disgustingly.
[137:16.78]And she's trying to get as much food in her mouth as possible before she has to talk again.
[137:20.90]That's because that's what you do.
[137:22.30]So I'm, like, noticing that because that's what I was trying to do.
[137:25.20]And it's just an awkward situation because then she begins to talk and I'm like, okay, here's my opportunity to eat food.
[137:31.41]Okay, like, yeah, go on, keep talking.
[137:33.91]Okay, one bite, two bites, swallow it quick before I have to talk next.
[137:37.62]Why do we go there?
[137:38.64]Don't go eat food when you have to, like, be social.
[137:41.38]What's wrong with us?
[137:45.18]Go to, like, the arcade.
[137:48.26]Go to a coffee shop.
[137:49.16]At least when you drink coffee, you don't have to, like... What is this?
[137:52.26]What is this?
[137:52.60]Come on, finish this one.
[137:54.74]Oh, yeah.
[137:55.02]You have to bounce it back.
[138:01.39]This one's awful, too.
[138:02.65]I didn't even get the diamond.
[138:04.49]Damn it.
[138:08.58]No arcades anymore?
[138:09.48]Yeah, I know.
[138:16.65]You think I'm just a little neurotic?
[138:18.43]I just have the understatement of the century.
[138:25.47]This thing's crazy.
[138:30.45]Really is too bad about the arcade situation.
[138:35.35]I would love to be able to go to an arcade.
[138:36.61]I used to live in the arcade when I was a kid.
[138:44.40]Yeah, I'll read some more bits after this is done.
[138:47.44]I gotta focus on this level.
[138:49.16]It's hard.
[138:50.64]My brain is too small.
[138:56.06]DDR at the arcade.
[138:58.72]I never got into DDR.
[138:59.55]It wasn't my game.
[139:02.35]My game of choice was...
[139:05.74]Uh, I don't remember the old Die Hard game.
[139:08.80]It was a side-scrolling, like, 3D beat-em-up.
[139:12.87]It was my favorite thing in the arcade.
[139:15.87]I would dump $25 in coins into that machine when I was, like, in my teens.
[139:20.97]I would use all of my money that I had into that machine.
[139:23.69]It was the best machine in the world.
[139:26.23]This one just got all bouncing back.
[139:33.61]Time Crisis was great, too.
[139:36.77]Time Crisis is just a classic, though.
[139:43.75]Actually, it depends on what Time Crisis you're talking about.
[139:45.41]If you're talking about Time Crisis 3, Time Crisis 4, bingo.
[139:54.17]The cartoon slapping sound is the best.
[140:00.79]Almost moving on to a new tank.
[140:01.73]I think one more level after this one and we're at the final tank.
[140:09.17]Stream time crisis?
[140:10.21]Holy shit.
[140:10.79]What a great idea.
[140:13.49]That is actually a fantastic idea.
[140:16.33]I'm gonna do it.
[140:16.83]I'm gonna get the peripheral that's needed to do it.
[140:20.36]I'm gonna do a light gun stream.
[140:23.76]Because I'm... Who remembers Point Blank?
[140:26.94]That one was incredible.
[140:28.16]Another one of my favorite arcade games.
[140:29.50]Point Blank.
[140:30.64]With the two obvious, weird, Bert and Ernie, Mario and Luigi's.
[140:37.04]Those guys are amazing.
[140:40.36]Yeah, it was Bert and Ernie Mario Luigi on a safari.
[140:47.97]Look it up.
[140:48.45]Point blank.
[140:52.89]Type U and... Okay, Type U is that.
[140:58.77]You is the stupid one.
[141:02.27]Look at how effective the Angler is.
[141:04.63]He keeps everybody in the same spot.
[141:08.23]He is almost a necessary person to have in your deck.
[141:13.08]I keep calling it deck for no reason.
[141:14.76]I need more of those down there.
[141:28.49]The Angler.
[141:32.05]Another... Let's get two more in here and we'll be good to go.
[141:34.19]We'll start bringing in the Beetle Munchers.
[141:36.34]That should be good.
[141:40.74]Maybe one more.
[141:41.98]We'll go with one more.
[141:48.10]Beetle Munchers arrive!
[141:54.46]Light... That's another game that's kind of been dead for a long time is Light Gun Games.
[142:01.10]How come there's been no publisher that wanted to put something on Steam that was a light gun game?
[142:06.06]Try to make a new one.
[142:08.74]I guess I can understand.
[142:09.58]Because you do need to have... You'd have to make an entire accessory.
[142:14.30]An entire game engine designed around only doing that one thing.
[142:18.12]I guess I can understand that'd be hard to do.
[142:26.99]On VR?
[142:27.19]Wow.
[142:30.17]Okay, yeah, the game development chat we're talking about right now, that would be incredible.
[142:34.29]That's not fair.
[142:37.65]Unfair.
[142:38.32]Absolutely unfair.
[142:44.48]Yeah, like, take notice.
[142:47.00]If you're a VR developer, like, take notice to the stream, like, if you're watching right now.
[142:51.05]Stop.
[142:52.94]Stop doing horror games that just rely on, just stop doing like walk down the hallway horror game and make a light gun game.
[143:00.41]Make like a real light gun game.
[143:03.75]Do like a, just no more, no more like is the bug on your shoe tech demo or YouTuber bait where you like throw shit at the screen and stuff and you're at like a, you're smashing your hands on a cash register.
[143:15.55]Can we get to like less horror games and smash hands on cash register YouTuber bait and can we get more light gun games on the VR systems?
[143:24.68]I would hope so.
[143:27.86]It's already a thing.
[143:28.74]Not a light gun.
[143:31.48]I'm talking light gun in your hand.
[143:34.69]Not two hands where you're going to move your fingers up and down.
[143:37.63]I'm talking light gun in hand.
[143:40.67]Accessory.
[143:49.85]Doki Doki is a great light gun game.
[143:55.50]What the fuck?
[143:59.63]Feeding time.
[144:00.29]Come on, boys.
[144:05.43]I don't want them to die, that's for sure.
[144:07.43]Alright, that's enough.
[144:10.45]That's enough of the Guppy Crunchers.
[144:11.55]Because I'm not going to be able to feed them all.
[144:13.94]Oh boy, I'm already out of money.
[144:22.20]Don't.
[144:22.68]I just paid for you.
[144:23.58]I hope you don't die immediately.
[144:29.54]By the way, you're going to be hearing these noises in your sleep tonight.
[144:34.93]Just like... Nintendo Labo?
[144:43.17]Oh, you better believe there'll be a Nintendo Labo stream on this stream.
[144:46.80]Alright, relax.
[144:48.18]No more.
[144:48.38]We're just talking about money collection at this point.
[144:58.93]Oh no.
[145:01.92]Where is he?
[145:03.88]Die!
[145:07.72]Alright, we're good.
[145:11.36]We are absolutely fine.
[145:13.16]Only left a couple of the front doors.
[145:25.42]There's too many to feed.
[145:27.34]This is a disaster.
[145:29.74]I just have to start collecting money.
[145:31.94]Stop spawning people.
[145:33.85]And just collect money and get to the 10,000.
[145:38.27]Stop it.
[145:38.77]Jeremy, stop.
[145:39.91]You have to stop now.
[145:43.19]I'm just going for numbers at this point.
[145:44.83]I gotta chill.
[145:55.32]Oh lord.
[145:56.12]There we go.
[146:00.10]One piece.
[146:06.28]I'm inside of a pinball machine.
[146:09.67]Someone just hit the jackpot at the casino.
[146:11.37]One more and that's it.
[146:18.49]I'm just missing these pearls.
[146:19.95]What a bad player.
[146:26.64]No, no, no, no.
[146:27.32]Just who cares.
[146:27.80]Fuck the alien.
[146:29.98]Give it 10,000 and win it.
[146:30.72]See you later.
[146:34.81]So, what's going on?
[146:37.05]Good question.
[146:37.57]Blip the purpose.
[146:39.33]Blip provides you with info that helps you better combat aliens and keep your fish fed.
[146:43.01]If you're wondering what that means, this guy just gives you like a HUD.
[146:50.56]You get to see fish health, enemy health.
[146:54.84]The purpose is a really good purpose.
[146:59.89]I think we're going to go with these three.
[147:03.05]See?
[147:03.57]It tells you which fish need to be fed.
[147:05.71]It's actually pretty legit.
[147:07.18]You can just hang out here.
[147:12.74]So this one, this is the last one in this tank.
[147:14.70]We have to play it smart.
[147:16.26]Can we play another game?
[147:21.93]No, I'm committed.
[147:23.07]I have to beat this game on stream.
[147:26.49]We have one more tank after this.
[147:28.99]I have to beat the whole thing on stream.
[147:30.72]It's only going to be like another, what, an hour or two?
[147:34.98]If I'm going to play Doki Doki, that's going to be a different night.
[147:39.40]No mermaid, not today.
[147:41.44]He's too important.
[147:42.43]These are way too important, and he's really great here because he slows everything down.
[147:49.09]Although I am kind of feeling the pain here of less money.
[147:58.02]Yeah, if I play Doki, I'm not even gonna say it anymore.
[148:01.06]Somebody go through this watching the VOD and find out how many times I've said the word Doki.
[148:04.98]And then splice them up together.
[148:07.07]Back to back to back.
[148:08.61]I'm curious how many times it's been said and I kinda wanna hear that.
[148:12.81]I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say 70 to 80 times.
[148:21.08]And he also shows where the alien's going to spawn.
[148:23.64]So he's very necessary.
[148:29.89]My hands are already tired from this.
[148:34.64]Where's the music?
[148:36.54]Why did the music get turned off?
[148:38.56]I was wondering.
[148:42.26]Come on.
[148:42.62]Oh, you only have like 10,000 HP now.
[148:44.19]Oh!
[148:58.70]I turned it off?
[148:59.52]When?
[148:59.80]Oh, I did.
[149:06.89]Alright, I need more fish in here.
[149:18.44]Which will turn into better food.
[149:21.74]The turtle's really cute?
[149:22.54]Yeah, he is.
[149:31.23]It's gonna be a slow burn to beat this one.
[149:37.48]Wait, what's with the FailFish?
[149:41.16]Why am I getting Fail Fished right now?
[149:46.46]I'm doing nothing but perfect execution.
[149:51.98]This is absolute 100% perfect execution of this video game.
[149:59.30]Get it on Reddit.
[150:00.22]But we'll get what on Reddit?
[150:04.76]Oh, Turtumus!
[150:09.84]Let's get the food upgraded to the maximum.
[150:12.47]Mmm... A few more of these guys.
[150:19.59]Now I need to stop, because I have to start bringing in Comfy Crunchers.
[150:22.43]But to get Comfy Crunchers, you need to make money first!
[150:25.83]Uh-oh...
[150:27.90]Probably should have upgraded the gun, too.
[150:30.44]Which was dumb that I didn't, but whatever.
[150:33.06]I'm gonna be ready for the... Metal Gear Solid... Metal Gear Solid 1 torture sequence.
[150:38.60]I was always the best at it, I told you guys this already.
[150:44.65]Everyone handed me the controller during that sequence.
[150:46.47]Because they knew I could do shit like this.
[151:04.57]I need to upgrade the gun so bad.
[151:15.38]Back to normal.
[151:16.26]Upgrade the gun.
[151:17.74]Otherwise I'm gonna lose everybody.
[151:26.08]This is the hard one.
[151:27.76]This is one of the hard ones.
[151:30.12]You should see the challenge mode.
[151:32.53]The challenge mode is almost unbelievably hard.
[151:35.61]It's almost incompletable.
[151:36.61]You're gonna get addicted to this game if you get it.
[151:45.59]This game's also on Steam.
[151:48.03]Just saying.
[151:48.63]If you're curious.
[151:53.55]I'm not spending any money on anybody until I have at least one or two upgrades in that gun.
[151:57.91]I'm gonna let this one go through my fingers.
[152:04.38]It's gonna take so long to get this money, though.
[152:06.46]I need more money!
[152:08.54]I could do more fish, but I don't know if I wanna do that.
[152:12.34]Do I cut my losses here and just get some more fish?
[152:14.06]What do you guys think?
[152:15.24]No?
[152:15.34]It's already there.
[152:17.07]Let's get it.
[152:24.41]Five dollars on Steam.
[152:26.55]For endless hours of entertainment.
[152:32.23]Alright, please get out of the way, guys.
[152:34.31]Out of the way, please.
[152:37.27]Pull them over there, pull them over there.
[152:39.90]Pull them over there.
[152:40.70]Okay, here we go.
[152:41.42]Three, two, one.
[152:47.02]Much easier.
[152:47.54]I'm gonna do this one more time.
[152:51.36]See if I can break the fucking world record.
[152:55.74]You know, friends of mine used to make jokes.
[153:01.84]Who remembers playing Super Nintendo with the turbo controller?
[153:04.38]The thing that hit the button as fast as it possibly could, code-wise.
[153:10.22]You could flick a switch.
[153:13.22]Funny.
[153:14.37]Friends of mine would make the joke, I was faster than the Super Nintendo turbo controller.
[153:20.03]So, there's that.
[153:27.86]It was unfair when I would play games that required you to do that.
[153:31.34]For instance, Tiny Toon Adventure is a sports game.
[153:35.04]I was unbeatable.
[153:35.80]Nobody could beat me.
[153:36.30]Because that game required you to tap A in every single weird Olympic event.
[153:40.17]Haha, that's a good joke.
[153:47.03]I could prove that on stream if you wanted me to.
[153:51.41]I could get a Super Nintendo Turbo controller.
[153:53.08]We could load up Tiny Toon Adventure's World Sports...
[153:55.87]And I will beat the Turbo Controller in the Spam the Button game.
[154:00.83]Do you want to do like man versus machine here?
[154:02.57]Alright.
[154:07.64]I'll figure how... I'm gonna set that up.
[154:16.54]Oh boy, here he comes.
[154:17.58]This is too many people too.
[154:19.86]These guys are gonna die.
[154:21.06]Oh, I'm so nervous.
[154:21.72]Why am I so nervous about this?
[154:28.80]Here we go.
[154:31.88]I don't want him up here.
[154:32.46]Don't bring him over here, Angler.
[154:34.18]Please.
[154:48.28]Bring in some more.
[154:53.40]I do like how I can see which one needs to be fed down here, though.
[154:55.46]It's so much better.
[155:01.81]Almost at the final tank.
[155:02.93]15,000.
[155:02.99]Come on down.
[155:04.65]I didn't get Sammy the Slug.
[155:16.58]I really needed him here, too.
[155:24.12]He would be doing such a hell of a job right now.
[155:33.01]That's what he just wrote in the chat.
[155:35.23]Seriously, what the fuck did I just join?
[155:37.51]I joined one of the greatest games in the history of all video gaming.
[155:46.38]I have too many of these.
[155:49.36]I kind of want to kill off some of these regular guppies, because they're really, really clogging the screen real estate.
[156:01.15]Shit.
[156:02.47]Do I have enough for an upgrade to a gun?
[156:03.95]Upgrade the gun, upgrade the gun, yep.
[156:05.50]Okay, here we go.
[156:06.46]It's drawn right here.
[156:07.96]Whoa, wait a minute!
[156:08.54]It's a different thing!
[156:15.50]Shit!
[156:15.96]We're fine.
[156:19.59]Quick, get down there!
[156:24.35]Oh my god, so many just died.
[156:26.17]What a pain in the ass.
[156:33.73]I gotta start bringing in some... Gotta replace the ones that just died.
[156:37.91]What does the turtle do?
[156:50.40]The turtle makes every item that's falling go slower.
[156:54.04]So he's very, very, very key.
[156:56.69]He's a very necessary addition.
[157:02.33]I'm gonna start bringing the beetle munchers if I have any hope to complete this.
[157:16.29]Eat, eat, eat, eat!
[157:17.23]There's one over here!
[157:17.95]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!
[157:19.13]Thank you.
[157:24.68]Alright, I'm still thinking shit's starting to blend together in my brain.
[157:29.58]This is too many fucking fish on the screen.
[157:33.28]It's a tight peak.
[157:38.22]I gotta be ready to spam, here we go.
[157:39.54]Almost had it in one shot.
[157:41.02]Don't, he's gonna...
[157:54.51]What happens when you get the fully upgraded egg?
[158:08.29]Oh, that's how you complete the level.
[158:16.37]I kind of have a very, very sloppy, sloppy management here, but, you know, it gets the job done.
[158:30.91]Not my cleanest, but I will take the win nonetheless.
[158:39.99]Some of you guys might be able to do perfect mathematics here and know exactly when to put the bugs out and what kind of bugs you want.
[158:48.38]Now I actually need to stop because this is getting a little... I don't even know where things to click on are.
[159:05.17]That's too many.
[159:05.93]Alright, we're almost there.
[159:09.39]That was a dumb mistake.
[159:10.47]Bad move.
[159:12.59]Bad.
[159:14.99]Type U?
[159:15.77]Oh, it's the worst one to have right now.
[159:18.90]Oh, this is bad.
[159:19.70]This is real bad.
[159:20.42]I'm gonna lose.
[159:20.98]No, just be ready.
[159:21.72]Just do what he's gonna do again.
[159:29.39]Oh, he's firing at every direction.
[159:37.41]What happened?
[159:39.81]I don't understand.
[159:43.14]What did I do wrong?
[159:45.16]Was there still the thing that was bouncing around up there?
[159:51.20]He just destroyed everybody.
[159:53.48]It's alright, we're good.
[159:54.74]We're gonna make it out alive.
[159:55.89]Two more pieces.
[160:07.09]Just call the herd.
[160:10.43]Get the sheepdog to move the sheep around.
[160:12.49]Right there, Izzy.
[160:22.88]Yeah, for people that are just joining this stream randomly... What the hell are you even watching?
[160:29.26]Could anyone even piece together what the fuck is going on right now?
[160:32.02]If they didn't see this from the beginning.
[160:35.86]Alright.
[160:37.46]We're at the final tank.
[160:40.28]Rhubarb, the hermit crab.
[160:44.72]Rhubarb makes it so fish do not go to the bottom of the tank.
[160:50.36]Oh, concentration.
[160:51.98]Here we go.
[161:24.80]1200, exactly.
[161:28.87]And still not even close.
[161:31.37]So now we're filling out a team here.
[161:34.97]So I'm going to keep Crab.
[161:37.01]Crab is just really good in general.
[161:39.83]Keep Blip.
[161:42.11]Having that HUD information is super important.
[161:44.37]I think I'm just going to... That's my favorite team, I think.
[161:47.97]Because yeah, he keeps people from off the bottom of the tank, but who cares if you have Gumbo?
[161:57.69]New tank!
[161:58.93]Here's the final tank.
[162:00.81]This tank, the difference here is you do not buy any fish.
[162:06.10]You buy the pregnant lady.
[162:08.70]That's it.
[162:09.82]And then eventually she's gonna shit out babies, which then you have to feed to this guy, which then you have to feed to another guy, so that guy eats this guy.
[162:16.92]It gets a little wacky.
[162:18.52]Insane aquarium.
[162:22.24]But I'm willing to take up the challenge.
[162:28.20]Bits.
[162:28.48]Once I get done with this tank, we'll do some bits.
[162:30.55]And then at the end of the stream, I'm going to go over all the bits I missed before.
[162:38.31]But yeah, this is the last tank where the game is complete.
[162:41.89]I believe that is true.
[162:44.28]Then there's time trials and challenges.
[162:48.24]And I believe that the time trials are... I think you have a certain amount of time to get to a certain amount of money.
[162:55.52]Something like that.
[162:57.00]It's been a long time.
[163:02.52]I'm not getting any money.
[163:03.30]You know, this is probably a time to get the... the pearl, Niko.
[163:09.26]It's because I'm just constantly out of money.
[163:16.21]My laser is a piece of shit too.
[163:19.99]Ugh.
[163:25.96]You really gotta just stuff them down in the crab.
[163:27.53]Crab is so good.
[163:28.43]I don't know why the hell I'd ever take it off.
[163:29.83]Let's get two pregnant ladies here.
[163:39.65]Yeah, one of the secret bonus mascot fish deck people is a nose.
[163:45.29]It's a floating nose that sneezes.
[163:49.82]But it costs, I think it costs like a hundred thousand shells to get it.
[163:57.24]Something along those lines.
[164:02.06]But we got a slow burn here.
[164:03.90]Really need to get one of these guys out here now.
[164:10.74]Actually, you probably shouldn't have one of those come out yet until you have at least three of these.
[164:17.05]Otherwise this guy's gonna starve to death because he has nothing to eat.
[164:23.48]And I'm running out of, I can't, I only have one piece of food and one, it's the shitty pellet.
[164:32.11]Everyone's just constantly hungry.
[164:33.37]Alright, I need Bathley.
[164:38.11]Oh God, I didn't think this through.
[164:43.09]I didn't think this through.
[164:47.23]What kind of enemy is it?
[164:51.21]That's why the crab is the best.
[164:53.74]Just needed to get him in the right spot.
[164:55.84]That's it.
[164:56.40]He does all the work.
[165:03.37]Now I got some... I got an opportunity here.
[165:07.85]Get to a thousand.
[165:10.07]No more... Let's do... Alright, that's it.
[165:11.81]That's it.
[165:12.15]Now... Actually, that's it.
[165:13.73]Because I'm going to not be able to feed everybody.
[165:20.16]Oh, fuck.
[165:20.62]They're dead.
[165:21.64]Come on.
[165:22.18]Wait.
[165:24.10]Nice.
[165:24.56]Okay.
[165:24.82]We're fine.
[165:29.05]I'm kind of out of control right now.
[165:31.13]I'm out of control.
[165:33.85]There's too many miles to feed and not enough food.
[165:40.31]I so desperately need one of those carnivores.
[165:42.55]This is gonna start fighting.
[165:50.56]Almost there.
[165:55.08]200 more dollars, come on.
[166:01.23]There we go.
[166:02.55]Now this... I need those mothers alive.
[166:10.41]Where is he going?
[166:11.11]Down there?
[166:12.75]Stay away from that, please.
[166:24.03]Only need 3,000.
[166:24.49]It's not that much.
[166:27.89]Oh boy.
[166:30.01]Somebody's dead.
[166:31.75]Whoops!
[166:32.55]I'm gonna get the king guppy.
[166:39.34]What's the, what do you mean?
[166:40.16]Oh yeah, the, you, yeah.
[166:42.22]I forgot about that.
[166:43.06]If they stay alive long enough and you keep feeding them, they actually get a crown on their head and shit out stars.
[166:53.24]I need to thin out this population a little bit, though.
[167:00.11]Even me spamming this with a maximum amount of food, I still can't even keep up.
[167:06.50]Yeah, I did that for a junk, but that was actually really dumb.
[167:21.72]no my fingers my poor fingers alright now we can just collect and we'll get to the next time overpopulation
[167:51.62]Time to just win.
[167:53.00]Here comes the massive amount of diamonds.
[167:58.30]Very quickly we're getting up to 3,000.
[168:03.14]Perfect.
[168:25.91]It's too many.
[168:27.19]It's too many.
[168:27.77]I can't even feed them all in time.
[168:34.30]Oh, it's chaos.
[168:40.36]Keep doing it.
[168:41.66]Fine.
[168:41.90]Let me just make sure everyone's been fed.
[168:49.51]Now there's no way I can feed them all.
[168:51.11]There really isn't.
[168:51.79]It's not possible.
[168:56.19]It's just not possible.
[168:58.61]Somebody eventually has to die here.
[169:00.13]There's too many mouse to feed!
[169:05.81]I should just let them die.
[169:07.19]That's too many.
[169:13.01]It's alright, we got a couple more coming in.
[169:15.48]Look at those starving faces.
[169:21.06]And now I'm just gonna leave.
[169:32.41]I can't, I don't have enough money.
[169:34.01]I don't have enough money to feed anybody.
[169:36.87]There's not enough food.
[169:40.33]Even when I'm spamming.
[169:43.67]Oh no.
[169:44.57]There's four fishes.
[169:50.33]Let's get the diamonds, who cares?
[169:57.19]Take the money and run!
[170:03.75]How many do we need?
[170:04.69]9,000?
[170:04.71]Alright, we're good.
[170:15.35]We're out.
[170:17.13]You monster.
[170:19.77]Nimbus the manta ray.
[170:22.47]Nimbus tosses any coins or food he catches back up toward the top of the tank.
[170:27.15]So they just... He goes back and forth and they bounce back up and down.
[170:30.51]He kind of sucks.
[170:32.66]But I guess I could see a scenario where you'd have him.
[170:35.86]And maybe... I don't know.
[170:39.28]Like him.
[170:40.32]So he can just bounce coins around into him.
[170:42.66]Maybe it would make sense.
[170:45.92]But I'm gonna stick with the dream team.
[170:47.05]Because why else would you pick something else?
[170:54.49]Oh, get your bits.
[170:55.61]I keep starting it.
[170:56.35]There we go, see?
[170:59.63]Alright, well, you know, while I have a second, let's do some bits.
[171:02.38]Let's do at least like five or 10.
[171:05.84]1914, thanks for the $5, jermaMars.
[171:07.38]Thanks a lot, 19.
[171:09.17]Snail Down, thanks for the $1.
[171:11.65]Yo, Gerber, your favorite die-hard game at the arcades is on SEGA Saturn.
[171:15.62]And the sequel, Dynamite Cop, is on the Dreamcast.
[171:19.08]Would love to see you stream them.
[171:20.40]Also, GonCon Peripheral or other real one-to-one accurate light guns don't work unless you have a very specific type of older TV.
[171:28.57]Curved glass.
[171:31.94]That is true.
[171:34.16]That is true.
[171:35.40]But some of these, like, brilliant minds, you know, we've got people coming up with the blockchain.
[171:39.96]You know, make a blockchain light gun peripheral.
[171:43.25]It'll work perfectly.
[171:45.83]But thank you, SnailDown.
[171:47.63]StixRenegade, thanks for the 50 cents.
[171:49.37]Prove it.
[171:49.79]Clicking test right now.
[171:50.85]I don't even know where to go to do that.
[171:53.01]But I would destroy it, whatever it was.
[171:56.41]Cap'n Jackbeard, thanks for the $1.
[171:58.07]Look up duck season on stream for your VR light gun needs.
[172:02.60]CurvedGlass.
[172:06.39]Thank you, Captain Jack Ridd.
[172:07.27]I will look up duck season.
[172:09.59]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[172:10.85]If you don't sit in a giant box and make game noises for like 20 minutes during the Nintendo Labo stream, I'll be disappointed.
[172:17.65]Well, if you were here at the last stream that I did, we talked about the joke that I was going to do.
[172:22.98]I spoiled the whole thing, but just keep that a secret because if you don't know, I have a thing I'm going to do when that comes out.
[172:29.62]Thank you, Tingy.
[172:30.66]Appreciate it, though.
[172:31.18]Thanks for the $1.
[172:31.80]Thank you.
[172:32.12]Beware.
[172:33.10]I live for the $1.
[172:36.24]Talking about Dynamite Cop for the Dreamcast stream.
[172:38.97]Absolutely.
[172:39.57]I will get it.
[172:41.23]Dearly beloved, thanks for the $1 light gun stream hype.
[172:44.13]Yeah, there's a lot of... Let's do like a lot of fucking shit, huh?
[172:47.19]Let's do a lot of shit.
[172:48.95]We're talking about like a bunch of light gun games.
[172:51.20]I'll get an old CRTV.
[172:53.10]I'll get an old fucking TV and plug it in right here and we can play it.
[172:57.92]I'm gonna do it.
[173:02.35]Doesn't he bounce food back up?
[173:04.41]Um... He doesn't.
[173:06.48]The Stingray does.
[173:11.62]The Stingray does.
[173:12.68]Let's do a lot of drugs.
[173:15.78]No, you don't do drugs.
[173:16.82]Oh, by the way, the Ultravore has to eat the Carnivore.
[173:21.39]So, Pregnant Lady has a baby.
[173:23.11]Carnivore eats the baby.
[173:24.89]Ultravore eats the Carnivore.
[173:28.59]Thus the vicious cycle of predator-prey continues.
[173:36.27]144p stream.
[173:43.30]It's gonna be no different than when I did SEGA CD.
[173:46.24]Those games were not even in 480, I don't think, and we tolerated it.
[173:52.63]This is type 2.
[173:53.29]I believe this is two aliens at the same time.
[173:56.13]I think.
[173:56.77]I know that ends up happening here.
[173:59.48]It's the stupid snake.
[174:07.16]Bring him to the crab.
[174:13.35]I remember that was what pissed me off the most.
[174:15.31]When you get two octopuses, two octopi, good luck.
[174:19.45]You're guaranteed to lose.
[174:20.87]That's a guaranteed loss.
[174:22.07]There's no way to stop it because one of them heals while the other one runs around rampant.
[174:29.17]That was just a Shadow of Colossus enemy.
[174:31.89]Speaking of which, I might stream that when it comes out for the remaster.
[174:35.23]When does that come out?
[174:38.15]Soon, right?
[174:39.85]And by soon I mean... March or something?
[174:50.64]Twitch is dying?
[174:53.02]Really?
[174:58.25]Wait, twitch.tv is like dying right now?
[175:01.28]Uh-oh.
[175:12.58]PSA, nobody refresh.
[175:14.10]Twitch is messed up.
[175:15.04]Uh-oh.
[175:15.86]Don't refresh the screen, otherwise you're not going to be able to watch, apparently.
[175:18.82]Uh-oh.
[175:22.66]Don't let the pregnant one die.
[175:31.48]You refresh, you're gone.
[175:35.26]Crab.
[175:40.67]Come on, crab, reach.
[175:45.13]Reach!
[175:48.63]I would say nice work, but it wasn't really a nice job.
[175:50.79]You could have done much better than that, crab.
[175:52.42]What the fuck?
[175:58.55]Uh-oh, you guys are stuck here.
[176:02.23]Site-wide problem.
[176:03.41]Now you can't leave the stream.
[176:06.13]You're stuck here forever.
[176:07.75]Wait, is it going to be one of those situations?
[176:12.05]I remember a long time ago.
[176:14.93]Twitch was really messed up.
[176:17.96]A whole site was down.
[176:19.32]And nobody could stream.
[176:20.74]You could not give an ingest into Twitch.
[176:24.68]If you pressed start streaming, your upload would go nowhere.
[176:29.49]And there was like three guys that were still able to stream.
[176:33.85]And they had just like 60,000 people each.
[176:39.00]It was like I was playing Minecraft and he was like what's happening He was like the only guy that was allowed to be on stream just for some happenstance reason it was insanity They locked out like everybody nobody could stream it was all fucked up except it was like three guys Like a hundred thousand people watching
[177:04.29]And I remember the whole time he was just like, yeah, I'm not sure what's going on here.
[177:07.35]I think there's some problems.
[177:08.33]He was like, he was the, like he was the guy, he was the reporter in the middle of the hurricane.
[177:14.28]Right?
[177:15.38]Like, you know, Bill, I'm not sure.
[177:16.82]Oh, there's a fucking hurricane outside.
[177:20.88]My sources say that my house is going to get knocked down.
[177:25.66]Oh yeah, let's actually bring some of these guys in here.
[177:34.78]Hey, you know crazy, you know bill crazy Come on eat somebody I Didn't get any more pregnant ladies.
[177:50.20]That was the biggest mistake.
[177:51.16]I'm wondering what the hell they all are Alright.
[177:53.97]No more carnivores until I get at least three or four more pregnant ladies.
[177:56.73]I
[178:02.70]The only game on Twitch right now is Insane Aquarium.
[178:06.41]Oh, how much would people lose their fucking minds?
[178:12.87]What is this shit?
[178:14.49]One of my carnivores died.
[178:17.42]Fuck.
[178:19.36]Is this the only game you can watch on Twitch?
[178:24.68]I would single-handedly bring the whole site down.
[178:27.98]I would be the reason why, like, a hundred emails were wrote into Twitch support.
[178:34.81]Yeah, I was really, like, wanting to watch one of my favorite League streamers, but holy shit, man, like, all I could watch was this fucking loser play Insane Aquarium.
[178:43.83]Like, can you fix that, Twitch?
[178:45.33]Can you fix that, please?
[178:50.83]It's not what I came to the site for.
[178:56.50]Wrote.
[178:56.92]Written.
[178:57.52]Wrote.
[178:57.80]Potato.
[178:58.16]Potato.
[178:59.40]There.
[178:59.82]There.
[179:02.18]All the same shit.
[179:09.85]I should just go play this on the Master of Comedy.
[179:13.71]I could.
[179:15.97]I could go to the Master of Comedy.
[179:18.29]And stream Insane Aquarium every day.
[179:20.79]What if this just became the game that I play?
[179:22.21]You know how people play the same game every day?
[179:25.42]You know, I'm an Overwatch streamer.
[179:28.14]I'm a PUBG streamer.
[179:30.05]I play PUBG every day.
[179:32.63]What if I was an insane aquarium streamer?
[179:35.15]Well, that's just, I mean, to be real, that's kind of what's going to happen.
[179:46.64]At least I would corner the market, right?
[179:50.32]I would corner the entire...
[179:55.34]Let's get a, uh, those are 10,000.
[180:02.94]I need to upgrade the gun.
[180:04.14]What the hell am I doing?
[180:05.40]People are gonna start dying here.
[180:11.10]Didn't even upgrade the gun once.
[180:12.54]Oh, these are all dead.
[180:13.52]They're all dead.
[180:14.78]They're all dead.
[180:16.68]Go by, everybody.
[180:18.84]Why would you bring them?
[180:21.24]Wow!
[180:23.95]I thought we were gonna see a situation where every single person just died.
[180:29.97]Stop.
[180:30.17]Everything's fine.
[180:40.24]No more, now I gotta focus on getting carnivores.
[180:44.00]This-
[180:50.55]I gotta collect money.
[180:51.61]I'm gonna run out of money because I have to feed.
[181:01.11]Oh no, that's too many.
[181:06.26]I'm running out of fucking money because I have to spam.
[181:08.96]I have to fucking spam.
[181:25.57]All the money's just going away, disappearing, I'm not even focusing on it.
[181:29.03]Somewhere there's a statement there.
[181:31.33]I'm not sure what it is.
[181:38.12]Some people are going to have to die here.
[181:41.50]Yeah, it's just inevitable.
[181:42.64]Some of them have to die.
[181:45.06]I just can't keep up with it.
[181:46.14]There's not enough people.
[181:55.13]Don't kill any carnivores.
[181:56.77]I can't even keep up.
[182:02.93]I have to sit here and spam.
[182:16.08]I'm gonna sit here and spam until they're all fed.
[182:30.74]This is never ending.
[182:32.04]The arrows never stop.
[182:34.08]There we go.
[182:36.83]Everyone's been fed.
[182:39.05]We have three years of political rest.
[182:44.07]The unrest begins again.
[182:45.27]Oh, the diamond.
[182:54.93]This is why Sammy the Slug is so important.
[183:05.04]He's saving the slug.
[183:13.62]Alright, we're almost there.
[183:16.36]The food chain can start to move up.
[183:27.15]This sounds like a YouTube poop.
[183:31.55]Oh, god.
[183:33.15]No!
[183:38.13]Oh!
[183:54.73]Whenever it's never ending.
[183:57.95]I gotta cut my losses.
[184:01.24]Only diamonds.
[184:02.96]And nobody else gets to be fed.
[184:04.82]Time to cut the losses here.
[184:06.52]Somebody said the stupid YouTube poop thing.
[184:09.90]And it's all I can think of.
[184:17.89]It's some shitty, like, Zelda YouTube poop.
[184:20.53]Or some, like, TV show.
[184:21.89]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[184:23.76]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[184:29.50]And here comes another alien to make this even worse.
[184:32.22]Come on, I gotta feed.
[184:40.69]Alright, time to bring in a big carnivore.
[184:56.39]So many green faces.
[184:58.19]Don't matter.
[184:58.90]Just all this is to sacrifice to get the king.
[185:00.86]There he is!
[185:06.80]He's so big.
[185:07.78]He shits out watermelons or something.
[185:09.62]They're like big watermelons.
[185:11.58]I mean, they're big green blocks.
[185:16.02]Alright, let's see it.
[185:22.38]There it is!
[185:23.32]Big watermelon.
[185:28.24]Now guys, at this point, the pregnant fish don't matter.
[185:33.20]All we care about is making sure that the big carnivore has enough to eat.
[185:37.90]That's all we care about, nothing else.
[185:44.43]Got two of these now, this is good to go.
[185:46.03]We should be able to beat this with just these two.
[185:51.91]I'm clicking so much I feel like I'm playing Diablo II.
[185:59.01]Alright, that's it.
[185:59.69]We're done.
[186:04.76]I suppose Legomod died.
[186:06.72]Because all that matters is just the big dudes now.
[186:17.17]There's no more food!
[186:25.60]Yeah, all that matters, because I get two 3,000 for each chest.
[186:30.40]So if you can imagine, if I spawn just to feed, I just have to spawn the carnivores, and that's it.
[186:37.13]Now I need to be very careful.
[186:40.71]This could turn into a disaster.
[186:44.43]Watch where that second hand is.
[186:48.19]That's alright, as long as the big guys go away.
[186:50.55]Easy.
[186:55.15]Easy, easy.
[186:56.86]Now we just ride this to the victory.
[186:58.38]Just pick up the chest and the diamonds.
[186:59.70]Nothing else.
[187:00.66]Don't even feed anybody.
[187:03.16]No reason to feed anyone.
[187:09.92]Make more room.
[187:10.58]I'm playing a clicker game?
[187:15.08]This isn't a clicker.
[187:19.20]Yes, it is.
[187:21.12]By its very design, this is a game where you click the screen.
[187:23.51]So yes, it's a clicker.
[187:29.56]Clear out the population, just have the things that matter.
[187:32.84]The huge guy... I'm saying this not... I'm not... I'm saying this as just a fish tank scenario here.
[187:37.58]I'm talking about money.
[187:43.68]We're almost there.
[187:46.38]We're almost at the end of the game, too.
[187:48.00]We've almost completed the game.
[187:52.60]And there she goes.
[187:54.94]You're a monster.
[187:58.21]Amp the electric eel.
[187:59.36]Amp can electrocute your entire tank, killing your fish and turning them into diamonds.
[188:05.20]So we're going to do an interesting strategy.
[188:07.88]We're going to have a million things on the screen, and then we're going to detonate with amp.
[188:15.23]Yep.
[188:16.07]That sounds like a plan.
[188:17.67]So who else should I use?
[188:19.03]Probably Seymour.
[188:20.03]I'm not going to have a crab this time, but that's fine.
[188:26.60]So you click him and he zaps the whole tank.
[188:31.72]I think we have one more tank after this and that's the end of the game.
[188:39.41]So this is all, the strategy is not about, it's just spam.
[188:44.11]Fill the tank with as many people as possible.
[188:51.47]Make sure you just keep everything situated.
[188:57.60]Stop using Blip.
[188:58.38]Why would I stop using Blip?
[188:59.34]He's great!
[189:03.82]He turns... He makes the tank easy mode.
[189:07.62]Yeah, just turn your citizens into money.
[189:15.11]I really... I could replace him for the Pearl.
[189:17.43]What do you mean he does nothing?
[189:22.83]Why do you guys hate Blip so much?
[189:27.62]Blip is doing so much work for me.
[189:34.50]First, we got our first dollar.
[189:36.29]Hooray.
[189:37.39]Blip is shit.
[189:38.25]How dare you?
[189:41.25]Alright, this is a feed.
[189:42.79]I don't have any food either.
[189:46.37]But this is one of the... This is the food homunculus.
[189:48.35]Well, um...
[190:01.74]Okay, so, uh, looks like we do need Niko bad.
[190:05.41]Because I can't beat him.
[190:08.77]Apparently.
[190:10.57]Okay.
[190:12.27]Hmm.
[190:15.61]That's the first time we've lost all night.
[190:17.39]Give me a break.
[190:22.33]And, Seymour?
[190:24.11]Yeah.
[190:25.07]No.
[190:26.63]Stinky.
[190:27.93]Alright, new dream team.
[190:32.26]No, no, I can't tell when they need to be fed.
[190:33.88]This is gonna be a disaster.
[190:36.52]Niko's gonna be useless late game.
[190:37.82]That's alright.
[190:39.46]He's gonna be so good early game because we can get like two or three of these pregnant ladies in very, very quickly.
[190:49.53]It's all about the early game.
[190:50.61]Stinky's back.
[190:53.97]What does Niko do?
[190:54.63]Niko, every, I believe, 60 seconds, every minute or two, you get $300. $300.
[191:00.97]He opens up his mouth and there's a pearl in there.
[191:03.59]So see, now Niko is great.
[191:05.07]Because look at our early game is very much started.
[191:12.34]Early game.
[191:13.30]Please stop saying that.
[191:14.48]Stop saying what?
[191:16.32]What am I saying?
[191:20.04]What am I saying?
[191:20.62]I don't know.
[191:21.26]What do I need to stop saying?
[191:24.60]Oh, shit.
[191:33.34]Come on, Niko.
[191:34.98]I need that pearl right now.
[191:37.24]I need the pearl.
[191:42.20]Ah!
[191:52.11]New plan.
[191:57.57]This will be a good team early.
[192:03.08]Stop using amp?
[192:04.58]I need to use amp.
[192:05.80]I have to have amp in here.
[192:09.68]Because I'm going to shock the whole tank.
[192:13.54]We're going to do a Bill Crazy here.
[192:17.68]We're going to get so many YouTube clicks from our crazy video.
[192:27.78]Amp is going to be a god late game.
[192:31.35]I'm going to slow down here because I don't want to run out of food.
[192:32.99]Alright, that's it.
[192:41.12]Now only food and wait until I get a... because Niko's going to pop up another pearl here in a second.
[192:50.74]Don't waste food either.
[192:51.84]Don't use it unless I have to.
[192:52.82]I need the better food.
[192:55.78]Somebody has to get to level 3.
[192:59.62]Come on!
[193:01.19]I'm one of these pregnant ladies, get to level 3 already.
[193:02.95]Oh no.
[193:12.77]Where is he going?
[193:16.91]Down here.
[193:17.25]Dude, you know how long this is gonna take to kill this guy?
[193:26.80]Don't go up, stay here.
[193:28.84]Down!
[193:31.57]down stay down here oh my god why no stay down here thank goodness we might have to do a sacrifice I might sacrifice everybody in there in a second no one is level three how is that possible
[194:02.16]Don't click the eel right now, not yet.
[194:06.16]Wha- Where's my other options?
[194:13.15]There they are, finally!
[194:14.27]There we go.
[194:19.25]Now we're good to go.
[194:25.07]Play it smart.
[194:27.03]Get the max food.
[194:30.37]Because that, I ain't fucking around anymore.
[194:32.05]I'm not going to lose to that stupid homunculus.
[194:38.57]Every dollar counts here.
[194:41.56]We're at the end game.
[194:44.18]Can't just mess around because you think it's funny.
[194:51.98]Alright, I'm prepared.
[194:53.36]Wherever he comes from, I'll get- I just wasted four food.
[194:57.32]Type G, I don't know where he's gonna be.
[195:02.28]Here we go.
[195:07.19]Easy.
[195:08.43]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect!
[195:09.81]I might just- I might zap him.
[195:22.71]I think I'm getting to an opportunity where I'm going to zap the tank.
[195:31.37]Just to make sure I get it right.
[195:38.55]I could use some money.
[195:48.02]Maximum food.
[195:48.80]We're good.
[195:49.68]That's all I wanted to do.
[195:50.46]I wanted to be prepared.
[195:54.23]Don't leave myself with no money because I'm ready to start it over.
[195:57.88]Alright, let's zap the fucking thing.
[196:06.40]What are they doing, now?
[196:09.18]Get a couple more in here?
[196:10.73]Whoa!
[196:11.45]Oh, okay, no, that's fine.
[196:31.40]Wait a minute!
[196:43.80]This is what I was talking about.
[196:44.84]That just scared the shit out of me.
[196:46.24]I forgot.
[196:46.74]UGH!
[197:06.46]That was some boshy shit right there, I'll tell ya.
[197:13.34]Zap him!
[197:13.70]Beautiful.
[197:26.57]That was a perfectly timed zap.
[197:35.62]Now we're making money.
[197:39.90]Just gotta make sure I get enough fish out here.
[197:43.63]Which I do.
[197:46.99]That was underwhelming.
[197:48.97]Just wait till I do it to the whole tank again.
[197:50.53]50,000.
[197:50.55]The next one I think is 100,000.
[197:59.17]Next one's gonna be a real pain in the ass.
[198:08.08]Alright, I gotta stop that.
[198:09.72]There's no reason to do that like I'm doing right now.
[198:15.60]Shit.
[198:16.54]I'll be died.
[198:19.56]Uh, I'm gonna zap the tank.
[198:24.45]Once I have... Oh no.
[198:27.79]Type G. This is the food one.
[198:31.79]Where is he going?
[198:37.15]Nice.
[198:38.57]Perfectly executed.
[198:42.34]I'm going to go for a tank zap here in about... Once I have enough to bring in a... I think I'm just going to do it now.
[198:57.20]Big guy coming in.
[199:00.10]Start the money making.
[199:09.50]Alright, no more pregnant ladies.
[199:11.02]I have enough.
[199:14.50]Almost have enough for a second.
[199:16.22]No, I need firepower.
[199:17.74]For sure.
[199:20.17]I'm gonna get that as high as I can.
[199:21.27]If I get another dual alien, this could blow the whole thing.
[199:24.43]If they kill that big guy.
[199:27.45]We need strategy.
[199:28.33]We need to be playing it smart.
[199:30.71]None of this bullshit.
[199:33.39]Get that to at least level 4 or 5.
[199:34.86]While I have time and while I'm making money.
[199:46.42]Alright, that's good.
[199:48.08]That's good for now.
[199:54.18]Multiple aliens.
[199:55.10]Here we go.
[199:55.66]This is where we separate the men from the men.
[200:09.83]Loving that upgrade now, aren't I?
[200:11.11]Let's keep him down here.
[200:12.63]I don't even care if I hit him.
[200:19.77]We're good.
[200:23.15]One more time.
[200:23.83]Good luck.
[200:27.58]Now forget about the pregnant ladies.
[200:28.62]Who cares about healing anyone?
[200:29.68]Just keep this ecosystem healthy.
[200:35.04]Now we're just looking for... Ultravores.
[200:39.76]They're all gonna die.
[200:40.54]Don't worry.
[200:41.16]It's alright.
[200:45.79]No, just do it now.
[200:53.59]There we go.
[200:54.83]It works out perfectly.
[200:59.54]I'm liking it.
[201:01.44]I'm liking it.
[201:06.36]50 grand for one piece.
[201:08.92]Took out the trash, that's right.
[201:14.71]What did we get, like six or seven of these in here?
[201:19.63]As long as I have enough of these guys floating around, I'll be fine.
[201:22.48]I'm gonna try to get ten.
[201:26.68]Ten of these dudes.
[201:28.36]Should do it for me.
[201:29.26]That should satisfy my urges.
[201:31.97]My capitalist greed urges.
[201:35.39]Multiple aliens again.
[201:36.29]Ain't gonna fucking win this time.
[201:38.37]Look at this.
[201:38.99]I want to have a max gun.
[201:49.24]Nobody died.
[201:50.30]Only expendable people died.
[202:01.54]Perfect.
[202:02.88]Now just collect money and win the game.
[202:07.03]We'll get one more of these.
[202:12.11]I wanna be spam clicking on chests.
[202:16.49]Pump those endorphins into my brain.
[202:28.36]Good, good, good.
[202:30.44]And that's it.
[202:32.04]Time to just collect money.
[202:38.70]Ah, yes.
[202:39.16]Doesn't it feel good?
[202:40.94]Doesn't it feel good to be on top of the world with your chest full of fucking gold coins?
[202:48.53]Just sacrifice them for money.
[202:55.95]Who cares?
[203:06.14]I'm going to fill the tank with them.
[203:10.32]Corpses on top of corpses.
[203:12.52]You're a monster.
[203:17.71]It's just a type G. It's fine.
[203:20.67]Once you have maxed out fully, they become very easy to deal with.
[203:27.45]Why would you come down here?
[203:32.67]Get off these boxes.
[203:34.82]Ha ha ha.
[203:40.97]Do a what on the last tank?
[203:46.43]Now I'm just being arrogant.
[203:53.01]This is total arrogance, but it's fine.
[203:57.92]Final tank is coming up here, I believe.
[204:02.84]I think it's 100,000.
[204:03.24]Which, as long as you get here, you're fine.
[204:13.52]Bingo.
[204:16.20]Jerma wins game, loses his morality.
[204:19.76]Gash viciously attacks aliens, but will snack on one of your guppies from time to time.
[204:28.22]Uh, this is... Let me see.
[204:29.68]Yeah, so you take a look at Challenge, right?
[204:31.10]I need to beat the Adventure.
[204:33.70]He is really, really good.
[204:35.04]I want to keep him.
[204:37.04]I want him.
[204:37.65]I want these to do... Forget about Amp at this point.
[204:43.70]Fucking real strategy here.
[204:48.58]Bring the shark and the... You know, we want to just do damage team.
[204:54.58]We're gonna do team damage.
[204:55.87]These are all the damage dealers in the game.
[205:00.43]They'll just spam attack everybody.
[205:08.77]Amp is basically cataclysm?
[205:11.16]What's cataclysm?
[205:15.14]Full on DPS.
[205:19.06]No healing, no support, no tanks.
[205:22.89]Just damage.
[205:24.59]Nothing else.
[205:26.05]Only damage.
[205:32.02]And thank you Shy Grimy T for the, or Shy Grim YouTube, maybe.
[205:39.68]Thank you for the $3.
[205:40.66]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[205:41.32]Thank you.
[205:42.95]Shygrim again thanks for the one dollar.
[205:44.51]Is this the hot new MOBA?
[205:46.95]You want it to be.
[205:49.03]You can make it whatever you want.
[205:52.94]It is your heart's desire.
[205:54.86]Whatever you feel.
[205:56.60]Thank you Hasnain again for the one dollar.
[205:58.18]Last bit I can donate for a while and gotta say you make any game into a great stream.
[206:03.80]I very heavily appreciate that.
[206:06.61]Just trying to have fun.
[206:09.09]Hopefully you are too.
[206:12.55]Type two, this is the, this is the long dragon bone thing.
[206:16.98]I'm gonna start up there.
[206:21.20]And that's it, I'm good, game over.
[206:22.84]Okay, cool.
[206:24.44]Alright, so this time we're gonna do something, I need money.
[206:29.72]That's been the problem.
[206:32.36]I'm gonna go vert, early game is so important.
[206:39.36]It's like come on too much DPS you need support.
[206:43.12]You can't just go in there with only damage Money only usually works pretty well That's why you need blip.
[206:56.99]Yeah, so you can see where that's exactly I'm talking about Do shrapnel for money.
[207:02.43]Yeah, but he can't shrapnel accidentally kill everybody.
[207:04.43]Oh
[207:10.86]Skeleton's just better.
[207:11.66]Alright, I gotta relax here.
[207:17.45]But Niko, you can get 300 bucks every, what is it, 60 seconds?
[207:23.73]Because then you can take that, what's better, sustainable income or just, here's the age-old question, right?
[207:30.56]If you win a jackpot, you win the $100 million jackpot, are you gonna take the lump sum or are you gonna take the annuity payments?
[207:38.59]I think I'm gonna take the lump sum.
[207:40.87]Just take, just do it.
[207:42.63]Who wants to use all that?
[207:43.59]What, you're gonna use that money when you're dead?
[207:45.57]You're gonna get paid like $50,000 a year for like 60 years?
[207:48.89]Are you serious?
[207:49.55]No, take the lump sum.
[207:50.67]Take like $640,000.
[207:51.81]You're alive now.
[207:55.67]You're in your prime now.
[207:57.86]I'm gonna take the lump sum.
[208:04.74]Damn it.
[208:06.30]Bottom half.
[208:15.03]He actually might not be great for here because he has to eat somebody every few minutes.
[208:23.70]I need that extra food.
[208:25.68]One of these guys has to get to level three.
[208:27.89]It has to be... Damn it.
[208:30.39]That's so irritating.
[208:32.91]I'm not putting up another pregnant person.
[208:38.16]Yeah, get all the taxes out of it.
[208:40.64]Take the lump sum.
[208:41.30]Because you might not think, hold on a second, you mean I get more money if I just get paid like $50,000 or $60,000 a year?
[208:50.02]That's fine, but think about it.
[208:51.16]If you're like in your 20s or 30s...
[208:54.34]Don't you want to be able to... Fuck.
[208:55.74]Don't you want to be able to use that money now?
[208:59.10]You have your prime of your life between 20 and 45.
[209:02.38]Go to goddamn... Go to the goddamn Bahamas.
[209:07.38]For like three months.
[209:09.66]You know, buy like 70... Buy like 75 Ethereum.
[209:23.42]And then come back in like two thousand twenty eight and they'll be worth like five hundred trillion dollars Somebody please get to level three before I run out of food to feed anybody Come on
[209:53.62]financial wizard.
[209:57.05]Uh, I'm realizing something very quickly here.
[209:59.97]I don't think any of these guys are going to be able to get to level 3 if they keep getting eaten by the shark.
[210:06.42]Let's hope one of these guys gets there.
[210:07.84]Otherwise it's going to be a big problem.
[210:16.24]Financial idiot?
[210:17.16]What are you talking about, financial idiot?
[210:21.10]I've got a 401k.
[210:23.01]I've got an IRA.
[210:29.01]And you know what I told my financial advisor?
[210:33.09]I said, hey, Dave, I want you to invest almost all of this money, 95% of it, into Campbell's, the soup company.
[210:45.04]He's like, Jeremy, what the fuck are you talking about?
[210:47.48]Campbell's?
[210:48.48]And I said, listen to me, Dave.
[210:51.00]When the world ends and there ain't no more money, you know what's going to be the most worthwhile company?
[210:57.87]The company that can make the food that can sit on your shelf for fucking 25 years.
[211:02.69]Invest me in tuna can companies, please.
[211:07.44]Oh, wait a minute.
[211:09.24]Oh, God.
[211:10.40]I wasn't prepared for this.
[211:12.12]I wasn't prepared, but we're fine.
[211:17.12]Ow, my stomach.
[211:18.76]I told myself this was going to be a scream scream, but apparently I'm a liar.
[211:24.99]Invest in tuna can craft?
[211:28.13]Craft macaroni and cheese?
[211:31.21]Because when... When the, uh... When the magnetized polarization of the world flips, you are going to want to have to be invested in a company that's going to be around.
[211:48.23]It's that simple.
[211:50.24]Jermacraft.
[212:00.76]Yeah, when the polar ice caps flip and negative is positive and positive is negative, you're going to want to have that Campbell's tomato soup in your fucking front lawn.
[212:09.44]You know what I mean?
[212:09.98]You're going to be like a lemonade stand.
[212:16.14]Invest in me.
[212:20.18]I'll invest you, by the way.
[212:23.08]I'll invest your money for you.
[212:27.32]That's not even like a pyramid scheme.
[212:30.68]Hey, just give me your money and I'll invest it.
[212:33.28]Thanks.
[212:33.72]I got two aliens here.
[212:37.56]I really need to get the extra juice.
[212:47.54]Oh, disaster.
[212:48.40]Absolutely fucking disaster.
[212:53.43]Fucking disaster!
[212:54.67]Die!
[212:55.45]Oh my god.
[212:56.31]They're okay, actually.
[213:01.85]Not that bad.
[213:05.13]Feed, feed, feed.
[213:10.33]Yeah, somebody just said invest in compass companies.
[213:13.39]I would agree with that.
[213:20.48]You should be investing in... smart investments.
[213:28.12]Stop shooting the balls, you have to!
[213:29.36]If you don't shoot the ball... oh no, everyone's starving.
[213:33.26]I didn't have enough... guppies... for me to eat.
[213:46.36]It's alright.
[213:50.31]I need to wait until these pregnant people get a little bit.
[213:51.89]I'm not going to put any more of these dudes in here.
[213:53.29]Let's try to get to 10,000.
[213:54.21]Give me some of that.
[213:57.57]It's very necessary at the moment.
[214:02.57]Buy high, sell low.
[214:04.99]One of the greatest investment tips anybody ever told me.
[214:07.85]Because then, you don't have to worry about it.
[214:14.01]Because you're always going to lose.
[214:26.75]You asshole!
[214:27.51]No!
[214:27.87]Goddammit.
[215:01.61]I'm going to make it impossible to have less than a thousand people on the screen.
[215:11.96]Grow them up really quick.
[215:12.88]It's level three food.
[215:20.61]Stop.
[215:20.89]We're not at square one yet.
[215:21.95]We'll be at square one if these all die again.
[215:35.67]Not all of it.
[215:36.21]I still have... I still have 1,200.
[215:37.59]I got 1,200 fish coins.
[215:42.35]I'm alright.
[215:46.68]Multiple aliens.
[215:49.52]Alright, get ready.
[216:04.14]It's alright.
[216:06.88]That's not the worst scenario that could have happened there.
[216:13.18]Back on track.
[216:14.05]Now this is where we absolutely take off.
[216:16.09]This is where we go on a bull run.
[216:18.75]I'm gonna keep using investing turns because I'm a fucking weirdo apparently.
[216:26.53]Mm-hmm.
[216:28.74]This is where we just go, go, go, go, go.
[216:35.12]Time to get the first ultra boar.
[216:40.54]Feed them all, feed them all, feed them all.
[216:42.88]Dead fish bounce.
[216:44.28]Don't ask me why people are dying.
[216:46.86]You should never know.
[216:49.48]Forgot about Stinky the snail.
[216:55.12]Well actually no, at this point it doesn't matter.
[216:56.70]Just collect your diamonds.
[216:58.00]Even if these people all die, who cares.
[217:01.75]Just trying to get to an ultimate.
[217:04.19]And to get to one, it's all that matters.
[217:13.00]Almost there.
[217:16.66]Almost there.
[217:17.56]There we are.
[217:21.46]Just don't die from this alien invasion.
[217:25.13]Please.
[217:25.41]Give him the safe spot.
[217:32.73]That could have been bad.
[217:38.03]Just took out the whole row.
[217:54.88]Eventually all the pregnant ladies will die.
[217:58.78]This whole stream has been a seriously take-me-out-of-context-and-use-it-somewhere-and-I-look-like-a-monster.
[218:04.74]This is where all the pregnant ladies die!
[218:06.66]It's like, holy shit, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
[218:17.09]So much death.
[218:24.23]Alright, slowly but surely we're gonna win the raids.
[218:28.51]But this is... I need to be very careful, because in a second these three get wiped out... We'll ruin everything.
[218:37.17]We'll get back to square one.
[218:38.15]I ain't going back to square one, I ain't going back.
[218:45.07]Make sure we don't get there by upgrading the gun.
[218:48.69]Fairly important.
[218:51.43]Type two.
[218:56.22]I am ready.
[218:59.28]You had to spawn up there, didn't you?
[219:06.44]Perfect timing.
[219:10.25]And so the cycle repeats itself.
[219:13.19]Time to win.
[219:21.55]Release that audio.
[219:24.48]I swear, I swear I was talking about fish.
[219:33.88]Not long now.
[219:36.88]I thought a big one died.
[219:37.66]I was about to be like, how is that possible?
[219:47.44]Whoops, didn't mean to click on a pregnant lady.
[219:50.04]This is another one.
[219:54.46]Ah, I didn't mean to click on that pregnant lady.
[220:00.98]Whoops, man, I have to misclick.
[220:08.16]Out of context, this game.
[220:14.26]I need more pregnant ladies, why?
[220:16.60]All I care about now is just getting Ultra Force to eat the carnivores.
[220:22.55]Multiple aliens.
[220:36.11]Thank God.
[220:40.06]Thank God.
[220:40.84]I had to be silent for that one.
[220:42.66]You need 75,000 for one piece?
[220:52.38]Easy.
[220:55.68]Just missed one.
[220:56.60]What a fucking idiot.
[221:03.55]Say like three or four more and I'm going to chill here.
[221:11.33]God, what a fucking great game.
[221:12.43]I love this game.
[221:14.77]This is just bringing back memories of how much I loved to play this game when I was in college.
[221:22.55]Don't forget about feeding them.
[221:25.47]They're a great source of income.
[221:26.93]Just max out my income.
[221:34.01]One more for a max weapon.
[221:36.99]Done.
[221:39.28]Now I can just hold the mouse button down and everybody dies.
[221:45.59]We're about to beat the game here.
[221:46.61]I think there might be one more level after this.
[221:49.07]I think so.
[221:53.46]Multiple aliens, bring them on, they'll die instantly.
[222:07.52]Oh, two of them died.
[222:09.60]Like, four died.
[222:12.12]I got way too cocky there.
[222:23.81]Now, please collect, so I don't kill them all in another alien invasion.
[222:34.63]Look at how much this takes to get to one piece.
[222:41.38]We're only getting chests, and I'm not even close.
[222:47.86]That's too much!
[222:50.23]It's Carnage!
[222:51.23]My hand!
[222:52.33]My poor hand!
[222:53.83]Oof!
[223:03.32]Ugh!
[223:07.10]My hand is fucking killing me.
[223:08.98]Just end it already.
[223:13.82]I have to complete it.
[223:14.76]Alright, only one more to do.
[223:23.30]One more piece and we're done.
[223:27.38]Watch out for the aliens, I gotta make this clean.
[223:35.84]It's fine.
[223:37.62]Sometimes you crack a couple of eggs when you're trying to make breakfast.
[223:50.91]And... done!
[223:54.79]Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
[223:56.16]Angie the Angelfish.
[223:57.12]Angie has the ability to resurrect dead fish.
[224:01.41]She's actually really, really good.
[224:04.67]Because she can do multiple fish at the same time.
[224:08.47]So if you have a bunch of people die in a row, she can just walk right by them and they all come back to life.
[224:17.67]Let's go.
[224:18.05]Let's just do it for fun.
[224:19.67]I think there actually might be one more level.
[224:21.56]And I don't know if my fingers can handle this.
[224:28.24]Hmm.
[224:33.17]Actually, this is one last level, I think.
[224:35.03]Let's see what happens.
[224:40.13]Yeah, we're gonna do this comp here.
[224:41.21]We're gonna do Angie and Amp.
[224:43.63]And... I don't know.
[224:47.18]Stinky.
[224:48.16]Yeah, this is the last level.
[224:51.20]Oh, man.
[224:52.76]Oh, my fucking hands!
[224:55.18]How am I gonna do this?
[225:04.00]I actually have, like, carpal tunnel syndrome right now.
[225:09.04]And Stinky!
[225:20.69]Somebody just said something disgusting.
[225:24.81]Stinky's useless?
[225:25.69]No, he's not.
[225:26.25]He'll be great here.
[225:28.71]Think of how many things just drop on the screen that I can't get.
[225:31.15]Actually, you know what?
[225:37.31]I don't have any money early though.
[225:40.07]No early game money anymore.
[225:41.15]I'm gonna need to wait till the last possible second to feed everybody.
[225:50.27]Why did I use the snail?
[225:51.11]You'll see how much of an MVP he is.
[225:57.94]One more, come on.
[226:00.14]Start to shit out money here, please.
[226:05.46]Am I gonna already have to sacrifice somebody here for some diamonds?
[226:11.56]Don't tell me that was a bad move if it wasn't.
[226:13.86]I have no DPS.
[226:28.74]Alright, here we go.
[226:32.22]Don't be a bully to Stinky.
[226:33.38]Yeah, what did he ever do?
[226:34.32]This is great.
[226:38.83]Imagine she doing that to 25 fish at the same time.
[226:44.57]Nobody will be allowed to die here.
[226:46.57]You know when it gets near the end, when it gets chaotic and everybody starts dying, then everyone's going to be alive.
[226:51.41]There'll be no deaths.
[226:59.98]There we go.
[227:00.34]Come on.
[227:00.93]Level up, please.
[227:01.67]Or I'm going to have to fry everybody again.
[227:06.13]Which I'm not against doing.
[227:07.39]Actually, it's a really quick way to make money.
[227:10.07]I want to get... Somebody has to get to level three, and then I'm going to fry everybody again.
[227:16.27]I think that's a smart idea.
[227:21.28]Why even fry them if she brings them back?
[227:22.66]Because it's three diamonds.
[227:26.60]That's just diamonds for free.
[227:28.79]Okay, here we go.
[227:32.11]Now I get a chance to try him, bring him back, and do it again.
[227:42.02]Come on, get it.
[227:43.88]Multiple aliens, that's not good.
[227:48.52]It's going to be the stupid octopus that's going to do this.
[227:51.94]Okay.
[228:01.97]Whyyyy?
[228:11.23]Somebody could use a gun upgrade!
[228:13.44]Real- Ready?
[228:22.36]Bring him up here.
[228:22.98]Go do your thing, Angie.
[228:29.91]Get him!
[228:30.97]Yes!
[228:31.85]Get that one too!
[228:40.07]What a... What a sigh I made.
[228:42.13]We need a sigh.
[228:47.54]I need a weapon upgrade so desperately.
[228:49.62]I gotta play this smart.
[228:54.24]I'm gonna get another multiple alien signature.
[228:58.41]Before I get even $5,000.
[229:00.27]Give me a break.
[229:04.63]Yeah, no cast time.
[229:07.48]She just has to touch them and that's it.
[229:12.32]I feel like I shouldn't do any more pregnant ladies.
[229:14.32]I'll get a good zap here in a minute though.
[229:21.29]Once I get that zap queued up.
[229:26.65]Stinky's doing some work.
[229:28.77]He's doing okay.
[229:30.53]Being a... Well, this is just type 2.
[229:33.79]Just dangerous.
[229:34.55]Just don't know where he's going to spawn.
[229:39.62]I got lucky there.
[229:40.34]Perfect spawn.
[229:40.84]Yeah, just walk into it.
[229:42.18]Dumbasses.
[229:42.58]Alright, zap him.
[229:59.94]Bring everybody up here so they take a long time to fall.
[230:03.14]And then electrocute the shit out of them.
[230:10.50]Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.
[230:12.32]If that's not the final level, I don't know what is.
[230:14.94]Alright, here we go.
[230:16.73]Bring them up.
[230:17.13]Get rid of this spam click in three, two, one, go.
[230:20.61]Come on, Angie, come on.
[230:27.11]Come on, you can get more than that.
[230:28.31]Give me a break.
[230:34.53]Let's get more pregnant ladies.
[230:38.01]I definitely don't want to do any more pregnant ladies.
[230:41.85]So that... It's going to get out of control, especially because they're going to be brought back to life.
[230:51.26]There we are.
[230:54.85]I need to get to that 5,000.
[230:55.73]Stop.
[230:55.97]What do you mean stop?
[230:59.63]Stop what?
[231:05.41]Stop.
[231:07.29]Stop?
[231:07.96]What am I stopping?
[231:12.96]I need more?
[231:15.26]No, no more pregnant ladies.
[231:16.56]Oh, you are so hard to control.
[231:18.22]Alright.
[231:18.56]You know what?
[231:35.94]Fuck it.
[231:36.12]Let's have a bunch.
[231:37.00]They're all getting zapped anyways.
[231:38.88]Who cares?
[231:41.62]It's the final level, guys.
[231:42.56]You know we can't fuck around.
[231:43.86]We gotta have at least 20 to 30 pregnant ladies.
[231:47.61]In my aquarium.
[231:49.67]At any given moment.
[231:54.65]Upgrade to the weapon.
[232:01.66]Get a good zap opportunity.
[232:05.29]How am I still playing this game?
[232:06.91]Because it's fun.
[232:11.27]Like I told you before, I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun, man.
[232:14.68]Here we go.
[232:16.04]One, two, three, free diamonds!
[232:25.44]They're all pretty much back to life.
[232:32.56]I like that strategy.
[232:35.87]Very, very good.
[232:36.53]Very good.
[232:36.93]Let's get up to... Let's get to plus four or plus five on the gun.
[232:43.11]Before we make any dumb moves.
[232:44.43]This is where we're going to separate it.
[232:49.38]I'm going to lock them all in the bottom left or bottom right corner immediately in the second round.
[233:01.53]Not too tragic.
[233:03.07]We're fine.
[233:03.63]As long as it's not the octopus, that's all I care about.
[233:13.04]Zap!
[233:14.06]Zap the pregnant ladies.
[233:30.00]Streamer electrocutes pregnant ladies to take their gems.
[233:34.54]That's quite a headline.
[233:35.48]We're almost there.
[233:42.87]To the point where we're going to just win the game.
[233:46.29]And we don't win the game, actually.
[233:47.29]I think we fight like a final boss.
[233:50.09]Thank goodness.
[233:54.31]We can finally end making...
[233:57.49]Pregnant Ladies.
[233:58.65]New stream title?
[233:59.51]That's... I feel like that would get me in a little bit of trouble, but it's all good.
[234:09.70]Maybe.
[234:10.82]Just a little.
[234:11.38]Multiple aliens.
[234:18.26]Just no.
[234:18.74]No octopus.
[234:21.14]I don't care what you give me.
[234:31.91]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
[234:34.14]Thank god.
[234:37.38]If that killed the big guy, that's a- that's a- back to the grind board situation.
[234:47.30]Is she just bringing him back to life?
[234:48.80]Yeah, she is.
[234:50.60]Nobody's allowed to die, this is just hell.
[234:53.98]You starve to death, and then you get brought back to life to starve to death again, over and over again.
[234:59.25]You're not allowed to die.
[235:07.50]and electrocuted to death, and then you come back.
[235:14.08]This is just a living hell for these fish.
[235:25.44]Let's get this upgraded to the maximum level.
[235:27.74]I think that's probably the safe thing to do.
[235:33.83]It might not be the most cost-efficient, but it's definitely...
[235:38.29]A reliable plan.
[235:39.47]Nice job, Stinky.
[235:42.65]Picked up a chest there on his arm.
[235:45.69]Nice work.
[235:46.73]Alright, I'm going to get some masks before they show up.
[235:54.10]Here we are.
[236:04.16]trying to get it I know I'm not gonna shoot him I'm gonna get him in the corner stay down here what am I actually watching
[236:29.03]You are watching Insane Aquarium.
[236:31.15]A game where it's a progressive clicking type game.
[236:35.46]Where your goal is to make as much money as you can to create an egg to beat the level.
[236:40.92]And you do that by feeding fish.
[236:42.22]Some fish eat other fish inside your tank.
[236:44.77]And all of them shit out money.
[236:46.79]Some of them shit out money that's more valuable than other people's shit.
[236:50.45]And it's your job to comb through all that shit.
[236:55.43]Find the perfect storm of money and shit.
[236:58.50]Alright, almost at the point here.
[237:05.96]Stinky's going to have to start doing some work because I'm not going to be able to collect them as fast as they are coming out.
[237:14.00]Maximum on everything.
[237:17.24]Where is Stinky?
[237:20.59]Just zapping, who cares.
[237:21.69]Stinky will get him.
[237:27.24]I think he has not really moved.
[237:29.03]He's not doing shit.
[237:32.29]I was wrong.
[237:36.33]Some people are gonna die here.
[237:40.03]Okay, be ready.
[237:41.39]Didn't even get to shoot it.
[237:44.76]Oh yeah, they did.
[237:47.96]Oh!
[237:49.88]No!
[237:50.74]Angie!
[237:52.14]Come on!
[237:52.62]No, over here!
[237:53.22]Over here!
[237:53.54]You stupid dumb fish!
[237:57.80]Ow, my stomach.
[237:58.50]Why did I just scream?
[238:05.80]I told myself, I told, I promised I wasn't gonna fucking scream.
[238:08.84]Oh well, it's okay.
[238:15.59]Did I scream that loud?
[238:17.15]Don't click them.
[238:20.89]Sometimes I have to.
[238:21.55]It's a clicking game.
[238:22.59]I'm gonna be clicking things.
[238:30.05]Too many chests, okay.
[238:34.25]Too many things going on.
[238:38.28]Okay, I need to stop making things, because I need to just collect money.
[238:41.94]Okay, last batch.
[238:48.58]That's it.
[238:55.74]Okay, there's one thing we're missing though.
[238:57.59]Just one small detail.
[239:30.02]You live and die by my command!
[239:37.83]Yes!
[239:39.09]Yes!
[239:56.57]It's getting too loud.
[240:00.30]Where, where am I?
[240:05.64]It's just like a shocking bunch of people.
[240:09.72]Alright, time to beat, I'm gonna beat the game now.
[240:11.16]Time to win.
[240:15.84]No more of this.
[240:21.46]There's too many Christmas presents coming down at the same time.
[240:29.96]It's just lemmings.
[240:35.27]What a fucking idiot.
[240:38.35]Why did I do that?
[240:39.27]I was doing that just to make you guys laugh.
[240:40.75]Multiple aliens incoming.
[240:50.25]Where are they going up here?
[241:13.59]My brain's on overdrive right now.
[241:19.10]I don't even know what reality is anymore.
[241:28.32]What is that?
[241:30.20]It's not about being in love.
[241:33.01]It's not about having a family.
[241:35.49]It's about how much money you can make.
[241:41.45]Nothing else matters.
[241:44.36]I just saw my life flash before my eyes.
[242:17.27]Oh, the senseless violence.
[242:22.25]The game's gonna crash.
[242:24.63]Oh, no!
[242:25.27]No, not these guys.
[242:26.14]That was close.
[242:26.78]It's fine.
[242:27.40]We have one egg piece.
[242:46.50]Why do I even need to pick up the diamonds?
[242:48.58]I have an infinite supply of treasure chests, which are 3,000, 2,000 each.
[242:54.60]The diamonds are like 300.
[243:01.07]All I see is 80% of your money being lost.
[243:03.15]This is true.
[243:25.70]Insane Aquarium is done.
[243:29.12]Wow.
[243:30.26]You could have beaten the game 20.
[243:31.12]See?
[243:36.77]Evil Alien Mastermind.
[243:38.93]Evil Alien Mastermind actually isn't very helpful at all unless you consider devouring the entire contents of your fish tank helpful.
[243:46.37]Here we go.
[243:47.19]Final boss is approaching.
[243:48.43]Everybody gets to be in the tank.
[243:52.60]It's a giant... It's an MMO.
[244:06.39]Stay alive!
[244:06.98]Oh, three people are already dead.
[244:09.26]Oh, well, he toughed it.
[244:10.92]Everyone's dead.
[244:11.56]Everyone died.
[244:12.22]The game's over.
[244:20.81]Everyone needs to move out of the way.
[244:22.11]I didn't focus on the aliens.
[244:27.31]It's not about speed here.
[244:28.42]It's about just getting it done.
[244:36.04]Jesus fucking Christ, man.
[244:37.64]Like, really?
[244:46.35]Come on!
[245:09.45]Come on, the most useless character, stay alive!
[245:20.88]Stay down here.
[245:24.48]Just keep him in the corner, locked in the corner.
[245:27.54]Stay in the corner.
[245:41.19]Play it smart.
[246:04.70]Ladies and gentlemen, your winner
[246:06.97]of the 2018 Insane Aquarium Jerma Rumble.
[246:13.37]Walted into shitty walrus.
[246:16.45]Don't even need to do that video now.
[246:18.19]Don't even need to do that stream.
[246:27.84]Presto the tadpole.
[246:32.16]Presto has the ability to metamorphosize into any of your other pets.
[246:36.14]You've been awarded 5,000 shells for defeating the final boss.
[246:39.90]Ending cutscene.
[246:41.86]Congratulations.
[246:45.02]You've successfully vanquished the alien hordes.
[246:47.81]The epic conflict between fish and evil has finally come to a close.
[246:51.31]Thanks to you, aquarium owners can sleep easy tonight.
[246:55.25]Many a pet gave their lives in the final battle, but do not grieve, little one.
[246:59.05]That's kind of... Angie purposely sat out of the fight, and word is she's got a few tricks up her sleeve.
[247:06.92]Everybody gets to come back to life.
[247:09.86]Don't worry, nine-year-old that's playing this game.
[247:12.14]Nobody dies.
[247:17.08]Angie here with the Resurrect at the end of the game.
[247:21.21]Thanks for playing.
[247:21.71]We'll see you next game.
[247:25.71]Guppy.
[247:26.59]Carnivore.
[247:29.61]Starcatcher.
[247:30.53]Guppy.
[247:30.83]Cruncher.
[247:32.51]But we didn't even do the coolest part of the game.
[247:33.82]Let me just show you that first.
[247:38.21]Ultravor.
[247:38.69]It's gonna show all the aliens too.
[247:46.41]Sylvester.
[247:48.17]Balrog.
[247:51.18]Gluttony.
[247:51.98]Gus.
[247:52.66]Destructor.
[247:55.76]I wish they would make an insane aquarium too.
[247:57.22]The game's great.
[247:58.64]Ulysses.
[247:59.48]Psycho squid.
[248:04.24]Bilaterous and Cyrax.
[248:07.85]I would have much preferred them make a Insane Aquarium 2 than a Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[248:17.05]I mean, I can't skip the ending cutscene.
[248:22.23]Especially when you have Yoko Shimomura's music playing in the background.
[248:29.81]Stinky the useless.
[248:33.54]I mean, I did talk a lot of shit about Walton.
[248:35.88]But Walton the whale ended up being the clutch one that just stuck around above that surface there.
[248:43.08]Made the surface level and he stayed alive.
[248:45.62]It's the only reason why I won.
[248:46.46]What the hell are these?
[248:52.48]Oh, that's right.
[248:53.64]The four bonus secret pets.
[249:00.08]That I did not open.
[249:06.85]Your internet broke right as I won.
[249:08.93]Oh, I'm sorry.
[249:09.51]Alright, George Fan.
[249:12.95]Thank you, George.
[249:13.85]You made a good game here.
[249:16.39]Jeff Kaplan.
[249:18.87]Programming George?
[249:20.13]George Fan made this whole game.
[249:23.25]What's he doing now?
[249:23.95]What is George Fan doing?
[249:25.15]Tell him to make another one.
[249:27.83]George Fan.
[249:31.33]George Fan.
[249:36.89]PopCap Framework, Brian.
[249:40.39]Look, he even made the music too.
[249:41.75]Look at music.
[249:42.39]Yoko Shimomura and George Phan.
[249:47.52]Quality Assurance, George Phan.
[249:55.04]Special thanks to George Phan.
[249:56.76]He puts himself.
[249:57.74]He's like, you know what?
[249:58.26]I took a lot of fucking time making this game.
[250:01.46]Special thanks to me.
[250:09.74]Apparently he's making a game called Octogeddon.
[250:12.94]Well, I wish him luck because this was a great game and he's a great designer.
[250:18.76]Alright, so bonus adventure.
[250:21.96]This is where you can just kind of start over to collect stuff.
[250:25.32]But see here, this is where it gets interesting.
[250:31.07]Let's go to our virtual tank.
[250:33.31]You thought it was just a game about feeding fish and fighting aliens.
[250:37.68]Well, I hate to tell you, you can have your own damn aquarium.
[250:41.88]That's right.
[250:44.68]Choose a name for this guy.
[250:54.19]Uh, Grundilda?
[250:58.80]Fierce?
[251:04.07]One eye.
[251:07.07]Um... Uh, how about... Um... No, not grow up.
[251:22.87]Grow up.
[251:23.81]Is he silver?
[251:25.09]He's like Mercury.
[251:26.80]There.
[251:30.24]Um...
[251:41.77]Whatever.
[251:43.95]And I don't have enough for this.
[251:48.88]Okay, let's go back.
[251:49.62]Oh, you can feed your fish here.
[251:53.94]It doesn't cost any money.
[251:57.64]You have an infinite amount of food.
[252:06.53]Apparently I can't, why can I not feed these guys?
[252:11.32]Are they going to die?
[252:13.36]Oh, special food.
[252:14.87]There it is.
[252:17.89]Eventually, come on down here and feed Flowey from Undertale.
[252:22.93]Laugh out loud.
[252:25.81]Tank.
[252:26.05]We got tank options here.
[252:27.07]Show fish name.
[252:27.77]Show the bub you later.
[252:29.83]We don't have it.
[252:30.67]Enable alien attractor.
[252:33.86]No.
[252:36.52]Current backdrop.
[252:37.26]You can buy backdrops.
[252:38.20]You can turn it into a screensaver.
[252:39.94]You can turn this into the screensaver of your computer.
[252:43.10]Pretty cool stuff.
[252:44.78]We can put in some pets here.
[252:46.24]Let's put in our favorite.
[252:48.34]Obviously gets to go in there first.
[252:50.40]Wadsworth.
[252:52.82]Angie.
[252:53.44]And my other favorite is probably Stinky.
[252:57.96]Look, the whole family's here.
[253:02.64]What happened?
[253:04.02]Who died?
[253:05.24]Oh, it's alright.
[253:05.68]It don't matter.
[253:07.43]There we go, there's the virtual tank.
[253:09.41]Pretty cool.
[253:10.53]Time trial, you can actually, um, how much money you earn in a, I think it's 15 minutes.
[253:19.51]I remember these being insanely difficult, but those are for a different day.
[253:24.22]Maybe we'll come back to this and do the challenges, because guys, there are still four slots that you haven't seen.
[253:29.90]Maybe one another day when I don't feel well, we'll come back and do it.
[253:34.12]Essentially, it's a dungeon run.
[253:39.71]Uh, the mermaid, it cannot be, like, clicked on or anything.
[253:42.61]I think she just does that if you click.
[253:45.99]But, that's gonna be it.
[253:50.94]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[253:52.64]I'm gonna read some bits.
[253:54.60]Thank you for sticking around.
[253:55.44]Thanks for showing up.
[253:57.32]Tomorrow is gonna be, uh, potentially, I'm not 100% sure yet, but tomorrow might be an Etalyx co-op friendly stream.
[254:07.49]We're going to try to maybe play this... It looks really dumb.
[254:11.85]Outbreak the New Nightmare.
[254:14.80]It's a co-op Resident Evil weird shitty early access game.
[254:21.92]This might be fun.
[254:24.30]But thank you everybody for watching.
[254:25.20]We're going to do some bits.
[254:26.97]See you guys tomorrow.
[254:28.19]7 o'clock.
[254:29.23]Give or take.
[254:29.67]6 to 7.
[254:30.07]Something like that.
[254:30.79]Maybe.
[254:32.71]We'll see.
[254:34.89]And thank you for sticking around.
[254:36.89]Now, if you don't mind me, I'm gonna read some bits.
[254:46.29]Hey, there we go.
[254:50.29]Stick that over there.
[254:53.31]And let's go back to where we missed some bits earlier.

[256:23.70]Don't ask me how the fuck I missed that.
[256:24.94]I hope you're still here.
[256:26.78]But thank you, Gabe, so much for the... That's like $70 or $80 total tonight so far there.
[256:32.53]Thank you, dude.
[256:33.73]And you say, I've never cheered this much.
[256:35.47]Oops.
[256:37.41]Jerma and mods are all amazing.
[256:38.91]Also, please, will you try out some more Binding of Isaac in the future?
[256:44.67]Binding of Isaac is one of those games that I play the absolute shit out of it for like two weeks, and then I don't play it for like a year.
[256:55.14]So, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point I get the itch to play it for some reason.
[256:59.92]Hasn't happened yet, though.
[257:01.14]But thank you so much, Gabe, for the $50.
[257:04.98]Much appreciated.
[257:07.07]Leatherjacket gave $1.
[257:08.79]Can I have your Insane Aquarium Deluxe FPS config?
[257:12.35]That's a private config.
[257:15.01]Only I can save the 4.5 FPS.
[257:18.60]Sorry, dude.
[257:20.48]I would love to give it to you.
[257:23.00]But I gotta have something special for me in my fucking game, you know?
[257:28.70]For Spud... Let me start over.
[257:33.36]For Spud's sake, or for Spud's sake, thanks for the 10 bucks, am I going to be at PAX this year?
[257:39.79]I fucking love this game.
[257:42.59]Both of your comments there, I could give a little insight to one of them.
[257:46.85]Yes, I'm going to be at PAX this year.
[257:48.63]Are you referring to PAX East?
[257:50.14]Because that's the one I'm going to.
[257:53.48]I'm not gonna go to PAX West, I'm not going to PAX Prime, or PAX South.
[257:56.62]I'm gonna be, just gonna be like a fucking hermit.
[258:01.06]And just be around Boston and just go to the Boston one.
[258:04.93]I'm getting too old.
[258:05.93]I'm old.
[258:09.07]But yes, I will be at PAX East.
[258:11.77]Thank you, Forcebud.
[258:14.31]Night Team 14, thanks for the $15.
[258:16.04]Thank you for showing me my early childhood game.
[258:19.60]You deserve these bits.
[258:22.96]$15.
[258:22.98]Thank you so much, Night Team.
[258:24.89]Insane Aquarium is a classic, great game.
[258:27.87]If you have not played it, and you want to do it, and you want to play the challenge modes, they're very hard.
[258:35.01]Highly recommend it.
[258:35.71]I think it's $5 on Steam.
[258:37.68]It's great.
[258:38.66]Runs perfectly fine.
[258:39.60]You don't have to do anything weird.
[258:42.86]Thank you, Night Team.
[258:45.64]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[258:46.64]Congrats, you just upgraded them into dead fish.
[258:49.92]Uh, thank you.
[258:50.64]Mazykit demanded a facecam for a dollar.
[258:52.58]I don't do face cams unless I need to put a facecam on for a certain reason.
[258:55.89]For instance, like, no, don't do it because I don't have any clothes on.
[258:58.25]I almost just did that.
[259:00.03]It would have been bad.
[259:02.33]Squiddy10, thanks for the one dollar.
[259:03.67]Please actually do the fish Jerm a rumble.
[259:07.46]If I have like 30 extra hours lying around somewhere to make another rumble, just specifically for this one terrible joke, of course I will.
[259:16.73]So what you're looking for is the answer is yes.
[259:19.39]I will do it.
[259:21.47]Eventually.
[259:24.27]Thank you Vriska Bland for the $1.
[259:27.04]Hey, thanks for burning my chicken.
[259:28.96]Also, are you going to play those two stalker games?
[259:32.40]That's right.
[259:34.06]I do have... I have...
[259:37.03]Shadow of Chernobyl still, right?
[259:38.43]I have two Stalker games I need to play.
[259:40.97]Damn.
[259:42.55]Completely forgot about those.
[259:43.63]Hopefully we can fit them in somewhere.
[259:47.59]Thanks a lot, dude.
[259:48.07]Thank you, too.
[259:51.01]Let's see.
[259:51.75]That's caught up there.
[259:53.51]Let's see.
[259:56.43]This is when we were talking about when I say your name, you get pleasure.
[260:00.25]Apparently.
[260:02.67]Pina Chip, thanks for the $1.
[260:03.87]Seeing you play this put the biggest smile on my face.
[260:05.57]Thank you.
[260:07.97]I am happy to showcase a game like that.
[260:11.07]And by showcase, I mean just play it.
[260:14.06]Thank you, Pin, for the one dollar.
[260:15.58]Hey, what's up, Pin?
[260:16.28]My lunch break is soon, but I can't decide what to get.
[260:18.50]Suggestions.
[260:21.38]Um... You know, I had a chicken salad sandwich the other day.
[260:26.66]And it changed my life.
[260:28.67]Because it was chicken salad and salami.
[260:33.29]And I just got... That combination, for some reason, I've never heard of that before.
[260:37.92]But holy shit is it good.
[260:41.64]It's just the perfect combination.
[260:46.46]Weird combo.
[260:47.06]No, it sounds like a weird combo.
[260:47.98]It really does.
[260:51.11]It's great.
[260:54.45]It adds this deep saltiness flavor to the chicken salad.
[260:58.01]I don't say ew.
[260:59.21]It's good.
[260:59.81]It's good shit.
[261:00.41]Try it.
[261:02.20]Next time you have a chicken salad sandwich.
[261:04.64]Salomo.
[261:07.10]That's what I would recommend.
[261:09.20]TechnoToast, thanks for the $1.
[261:10.28]Wow, I didn't know we were learning Harry Potter spells live on stream.
[261:14.02]PogChamp.
[261:15.74]I think I already said that one, but... What are you even talking about?
[261:23.40]What were you referring to?
[261:24.10]I don't know.
[261:29.54]I think that caught us up there.
[261:30.70]I want to make sure I don't miss any of them from back here.
[261:32.60]Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah, yeah, yep.
[261:41.96]Ty York, thanks for the $1.
[261:43.34]Doki Doki is a slow burn.
[261:46.10]It takes about three hours to get into the scary parts.
[261:49.94]But it's a fantastic game.
[261:54.63]I'm gonna have to get like drunk to play that game Maybe if I drink like four ciders, I could probably sit down and play that maybe one day Thanks, though Barack 99 thanks for the $1.
[262:07.52]Doki Doki is a good game over.
[262:08.96]It's not a stream game It takes three to four hours depending on how fast you read text before anything starts happening
[262:18.56]It's a psycho horror game and a similar meta attack like Undertale.
[262:22.05]Play it on your own time, if at all.
[262:24.27]Okay, well there's two opinions there, back to back there.
[262:28.41]Talking about... Well, no, actually not two different opinions.
[262:35.31]That brings us up to here.
[262:39.69]There's Jerma985Official giving me some advice.
[262:45.77]He's saying he's flattered that he inspired me.
[262:50.40]Appreciate that, Jerma985.
[262:56.42]Gabe DeGrossi with the $1.
[262:57.80]You missed my bits.
[262:58.92]Anyways, I hope this money can go towards the new Vive or something.
[263:01.76]Yeah, sorry, Gabe, that I missed you earlier.
[263:03.75]Gabe, are you still here?
[263:04.95]Gabe DeGrossi.
[263:07.51]I hope you are.
[263:08.25]I hope you heard that I got to you, because I never want to miss somebody that gives that kind of money.
[263:15.97]I left three hours ago, and you're still talking about Doki Doki.
[263:20.68]No, I told you.
[263:21.28]Somebody just fucking take my voice and just take all the times I've said it.
[263:24.24]I think it was 400 times tonight.
[263:27.85]No, he's not.
[263:28.27]He's gone.
[263:31.03]Ah, fuck me.
[263:32.01]Is he gone?
[263:36.77]He's gone.
[263:38.19]Shit.
[263:38.85]Somebody link him to this timestamp and tell him that I said thank you and show him what I did.
[263:44.11]Show him what I did.
[263:45.55]It's like I'm pointing into the toilet after going to the bathroom when I'm like two years old.
[263:49.50]This is what I did.
[263:50.12]Do you like that, mom?
[263:52.26]Good job, huh?
[263:56.50]Thank you, Nightfang, for the $1 YouTube link.
[263:59.16]I'll watch it after the stream.
[264:00.34]Thank you.
[264:01.62]Bia345, thanks for the $1.
[264:04.59]Play Doki Doki Panic instead.
[264:06.41]I don't know if that is.
[264:08.09]It's another Doki game.
[264:11.83]Custom Mayor Jordans.
[264:14.78]Custom Air Jordans.
[264:17.02]Thanks for the $1.
[264:17.64]Play Sleeping Dogs.
[264:18.76]That's actually on the pipeline here.
[264:21.54]I'm gonna play them all in a row.
[264:23.28]So I did True Crime, Streets of LA, True Crime, New York, and then Sleeping Dogs.
[264:29.15]Because that is the correct succession.
[264:34.65]Thank you to Emerald.
[264:37.12]Thank you, Emerald.
[264:38.94]Emerald Duber for the 25 cents.
[264:41.20]Just play Doki Doki on your own time.
[264:45.08]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[264:46.24]Play Cory in the house.
[264:47.30]The best anime game ever.
[264:48.40]Thank you, Nightfang, for the $1.
[264:49.26]Let's see.
[264:53.71]Any more that we missed from back here?
[264:57.49]Thank you, SkillSK3LL.
[265:00.11]Thank you, Skill, for the $5.
[265:01.29]My favorite Lord of the Rings character is Dobby the Elf.
[265:05.49]Dobby the Elf is, I would say, arguably the most important Harry Potter character.
[265:11.82]If it's not for Dobby, then Voldemort would have taken over the whole school.
[265:16.32]Dobby sacrificed himself and was able to completely turn the tide of the entire Battle for Hogwarts.
[265:26.08]If that character doesn't exist, it's all over.
[265:30.93]I agree.
[265:35.75]I do agree.
[265:36.01]We've actually played a few point and click games on this stream.
[265:40.96]I love point and click.
[265:41.42]The Neverhood is one of my favorite games ever made.
[265:42.66]We played through all of Harvester.
[266:04.69]which is an old-fashioned point-and-click game.
[266:08.25]I love those games.
[266:08.83]They're amazing.
[266:11.49]Thank you.
[266:12.68]Thanks also to Ricey Z for the $1.
[266:15.30]What do you call a sad frog?
[266:17.44]Unhoppy.
[266:19.42]That was pretty good.
[266:20.90]I liked it.
[266:23.39]Tingy thanks for the $1.
[266:24.52]Just let it happen.
[266:25.18]The tide pod challenge is just part of natural selection Is this one of those like I don't know what this is a meme Do I do I like need to know the way to know to understand this tide pod meme thing?
[266:37.87]Is that what's gonna happen?
[266:38.55]We're gonna get this from here Thank you tingy Thank You Ty York for the $1.
[266:45.75]It sounds like some Eric Andre show sketch I don't forget what you're referring to, but thank you.
[266:50.08]I
[266:53.39]Oh, my God.
[266:54.13]What is going on?
[266:59.47]Oh, my God.
[266:59.85]He said it.
[267:00.61]What did I say?
[267:01.66]He said the meme.
[267:02.68]I don't know what that meme is.
[267:04.46]You're talking to somebody.
[267:05.64]It's like your dad or like your grandfather asked you.
[267:09.58]He has a newspaper in his hands and he pulls it down.
[267:12.24]He's like, son, what the fuck are you talking about?
[267:15.55]About knowing a way.
[267:16.75]It's like, I'm just thinking of me like your dad or your grandfather.
[267:20.83]I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[267:24.33]Somebody tried to link me a video, and I didn't even click it.
[267:27.93]All I saw was I saw like... I saw like Knuckles from Sonic the Hedgehog with his neck stuffed into his body.
[267:35.22]I don't know.
[267:35.86]Apparently, that's it.
[267:37.20]I don't know.
[267:37.66]Whatever.
[267:37.98]Nice fucking memes.
[267:39.06]I don't partake.
[267:47.14]Boy, this went downhill fast.
[267:52.95]But why is that funny?
[267:54.73]What did I do?
[267:55.71]I just, I just said.
[267:58.12]That must be it.
[267:58.78]It must be something about just like, it's a meta joke about a fake meme that they're making up about a Sonic the Hedgehog character.
[268:04.94]Knuckles probably says something in Sonic Adventure 2.
[268:08.06]Somebody, some, some, some idiot probably played Sonic Adventure 2 and Knuckles goes like, hey, yo, man, follow me this way.
[268:16.81]And like, oh, you need to know the way to follow Knuckles, like that shit character in that terrible fucking franchise.
[268:34.21]You're overthinking it.
[268:36.95]I'm just fucking around.
[268:38.55]The person that figured it out, who knows?
[268:39.91]It's a JonTron meme.
[268:42.51]No, it's not.
[268:45.67]It's a VRChat.
[268:47.85]Oh.
[268:48.67]He said it again.
[268:50.29]It's not from a game.
[268:52.05]Alright, well, we're not going to do meme busters here.
[268:54.93]We don't even know if it's real or not real.
[268:57.25]You don't have to get Adam and Greg over here to do a bunch of fucking experiments to do meme busters on me.
[269:04.10]We're going to move on.
[269:08.14]Thank you to Sawdust Bunnies for the 40 cents.
[269:15.86]Thank you, Sawdust Bunnies.
[269:19.04]Gabe DeGrossi gave another dollar.
[269:20.45]Somebody track down that Gabe DeGrossi and tell him that I fucking appreciate him.
[269:26.72]I was too busy tunneled into the goddamn fish game.
[269:31.21]Somebody track down that Gabe Degrossi and tell him that he's loved.
[269:34.13]You know what I mean?
[269:40.37]Also, thank you to Mostly Lost for the $1.
[269:42.13]You seriously went through all the time to record that.
[269:43.89]Oh, that was when I did the stupid webcam audio.
[269:48.56]Stix, thanks for the $1.
[269:49.74]Again, Bill Crazy for Jermania.
[269:51.60]We already talked about that.
[269:55.15]Xenopika, thanks for the one buck.
[269:56.85]What did I just walk into exactly?
[269:59.19]Pretty typical.
[270:01.76]It was a pretty typical, like, dumb stream, I think.
[270:05.56]I actually had a lot of fun tonight.
[270:07.18]I did.
[270:08.26]Playing a classic game that I used to love.
[270:09.82]Hanging out.
[270:10.97]Talking about memes with you guys.
[270:12.29]I love it.
[270:14.77]It was fun.
[270:16.37]Thank you, Snowflake, for the five bucks.
[270:18.01]Wow, that was crazy.
[270:20.62]Lord Cantisama for the one dollar.
[270:22.38]Since we're on the topic of memes, Jerma, my... I'm not saying it.
[270:27.42]No.
[270:28.56]I'm not gonna say it.
[270:29.46]We just talked about it.
[270:30.70]So I'm not going to say the thing we were just talking about.
[270:35.86]It's just every day.
[270:36.96]Every day I do a stream, there's gonna be a new internet meme that somebody starts saying.
[270:41.04]And I'm just so far behind.
[270:57.25]has somebody made a dictionary and I'm not talking about an online I'm talking about a physical dictionary of internet memes so I can just right now I could have it in front of me and just go to tea and go to tide pods and understand what people are telling me I would love it but thank you wait for it appreciate the five dollars uh flipper bouncer thanks for the one dollar hey Jeremy could you make a poll for doki doki to see if people want it
[271:22.38]Maybe we'll do that.
[271:23.11]Not now.
[271:23.71]Not now.
[271:23.93]Because I'm definitely not going to do it anytime soon.
[271:25.61]Because there's a lot of shit planned over the next couple of weeks.
[271:28.56]This is going to have to be a long time from now when nobody cares.
[271:32.97]Like, I'm gonna be playing that game when no one gives a shit about it.
[271:35.73]Because, you know, um... You know, like, Getting Over It?
[271:38.20]When I played Getting Over It, like, a month and a half after it was relevant?
[271:41.46]That's kind of what... That's just kind of what I do.
[271:44.08]I'm, like, two months late to the party.
[271:46.16]I'm gonna be playing VRChat, like, three months from now, and nobody's gonna even give a shit.
[271:50.69]I'm gonna be so late to the party.
[271:52.23]Who cares?
[271:54.95]Who cares?
[271:55.75]I'm just gonna play it.
[272:00.37]Stuff with the doki shit.
[272:07.20]god 90 of chat said no well that's good uh caboose thanks for the one dollar Jimmy do you plan on playing metro last light
[272:19.28]Yes.
[272:20.87]I put a Sour Patch Kid in my mouth when we sat down that last time to play it.
[272:26.15]I wasn't in a really good space.
[272:27.93]I wasn't, like, happy.
[272:28.95]I was really irritable for no reason.
[272:31.25]I don't know if I was hungry or something, but I have, like, a sour taste in my mouth from that game, not because the game is bad, because I was being a little baby boy.
[272:39.72]And I do want to go back and play it, though, for sure, because I loved it the first month.
[272:47.22]Thank you, Official Tide Laundry, for the 10 bucks.
[272:52.03]Hello, Jeremy.
[272:52.57]Just so you're aware, we do not condone eating or ingesting any of our laundry detergent products, including our Tide pods.
[273:00.73]But that's good.
[273:01.29]Thank you, Official Tide Laundry, for the $10 public service announcement.
[273:06.01]Appreciate it.
[273:07.01]Thank you.
[273:09.00]Uh, this is a really long bot name, thanks to the 70 cents.
[273:12.06]Jerma DUH!
[273:15.68]Am I not... Remember I said the D word earlier in the stream, but the D word was DAMN?
[273:21.18]It's not the case anymore.
[273:22.45]But the D word now is DOKI DOKI.
[273:24.67]That is now a swear word in this stream.
[273:29.23]Thank you.
[273:31.33]Dearly beloved, thanks for the $1.
[273:32.67]Light gun stream hype.
[273:34.97]I wanna do that soon, that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[273:39.97]Now we've caught up to here.
[273:41.11]I think we're almost at the top here now.
[273:51.26]We should be.
[273:54.71]Yeah, now we're up here.
[273:55.57]We got, like, another 5-10 bits to do.
[273:57.87]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[274:00.72]The D-Word is a cool game, and I absolutely recommend it.
[274:03.00]Because it's not what it seems at face value.
[274:05.44]However, I don't think it would be a very good stream game for you.
[274:10.90]It doesn't get interesting.
[274:11.72]That's the same thing everyone's been saying.
[274:13.30]It's about 3 or 4 hours for it to get actually interesting.
[274:15.84]I'm not gonna stream it.
[274:16.54]Who gives a shit?
[274:19.08]I'll play the new thing that comes out.
[274:20.96]I'll play D-Word D-Word 2.
[274:28.96]Uh, Nock, thank you for the $1, Nock.
[274:31.51]Now that you have committed fish genocide, you're ready to commit human genocide.
[274:38.07]In EU4 or Victoria 2.
[274:40.93]Is that Europa?
[274:41.79]Universals?
[274:42.57]Universales?
[274:43.13]Whatever it is.
[274:44.84]I've never played those games, but thank you for the $1.
[274:49.36]BigCactusPoppy, thanks for the $6.
[274:51.40]Jeremiah, I fucking love your streams.

[275:19.86]Pokémon's just... I understand why it's so awesome, and I understand why people love it so much.
[275:24.98]It just doesn't really do it for me.
[275:28.16]But the answer is probably no.
[275:31.98]TyX, thank you for the three bucks.
[275:34.28]TyX49, thanks for the three dollars.
[275:35.82]That was insane.
[275:36.44]I think you're referring to the fish ending there.
[275:39.55]Thank you, though.
[275:41.11]Maisykit, thanks for the one dollar.
[275:42.29]Congratulations for the win.
[275:43.29]It's been a fun stream.
[275:44.19]Thank you, Maisy.
[275:45.93]TheGreatLordWalden, thanks for the five bucks.
[275:48.25]Hello, Walden.
[275:50.27]I know this is fucked up, but I sort of hope you don't feel good, so you'll play this more.
[275:58.30]Look, Insane Aquarium can be just the dumb game we go back to.
[276:02.38]Like, for instance, you know how I always have technical problems when I try to play any video game I've ever downloaded?
[276:07.20]Maybe this is a, fuck it, I have technical problems, let's go do the challenge mode in Insane Aquarium.
[276:14.72]Thank you, though.
[276:16.00]I'm sure we'll see it again.
[276:18.05]Techno Toast, thanks for the one buck.
[276:19.87]Wow, is this the guy who beat Insane Aquarium on stream?
[276:23.74]I am now.
[276:26.10]Travel Boy again, thanks for the bits here.
[276:27.88]These are the last bits I have.
[276:29.14]Thanks for making my life inherently better since I found you.
[276:33.38]Inherently better is in quotes.
[276:37.41]Thank you for making my life inherently better, Travel Boy, because you're giving me money.
[276:42.61]That means a lot.
[276:48.09]If you watch, if you give money, it doesn't matter.
[276:52.91]You guys have made my life fucking way better.
[276:56.85]Way better.
[276:59.64]So thank you.
[277:00.68]To all of you.
[277:03.32]Skill, thanks for the one dollar.
[277:04.52]Jerma never changes.
[277:05.62]I hope not.
[277:10.04]Fourth consecutive line, thanks for the five bucks.
[277:11.72]Way to somehow make an old clicker game so much fun to watch.
[277:15.67]Only you.
[277:19.53]I just think it's just a great game that has a lot of opportunity to have some fun.
[277:25.76]Thank you so much, 4th consecutive line for the $5.
[277:30.28]Nightfang, thank you for the $1.
[277:31.84]Somebody toucha my spaghet.
[277:33.62]I've seen, that's when like the Mickey Mouse knockoff knocks down the door and he's like, somebody toucha my spaghet!
[277:39.14]No, what is it?
[277:39.58]That's the Luigi one.
[277:41.55]It's like, somebody toucha my spaghet!
[277:44.41]I've seen that one.
[277:44.99]I did my research on that one.
[277:48.02]That's the fucking Mickey Mouse Luigi that opens the door, right?
[277:53.92]Somebody touch up my spaghetti.
[277:58.92]What's the Luigi one?
[278:00.62]You gotta have a lot to spaghetti.
[278:03.10]They're the same thing.
[278:04.24]That's Mickey Mouse Luigi meme.
[278:06.16]That's two memes combined.
[278:12.12]Thank you, Pin here, for $1.
[278:13.94]Hey, Jerma LA streamer here.
[278:16.90]Have you ever tried In-N-Out?
[278:18.62]Not to start any controversies, but it's superior to any other burger place in America.
[278:28.09]Well, In-N-Out... I've been to In-N-Out a couple of times.
[278:33.66]It's good.
[278:34.80]It's a burger.
[278:36.32]It's tasty.
[278:40.42]Yeah.
[278:41.44]I mean, I don't... I don't love it.
[278:46.50]I'm not a fan of In-N-Out.
[278:50.94]I think there are better places to get your burger that you would have a little bit more flavor profiles.
[278:58.15]And I think they would... We already talked about the secret menu bullshit.
[279:08.73]Somebody said obvious bait, but I'll say Five Guys.
[279:12.89]Five Guys is alright too.
[279:14.25]They're all the same.
[279:15.23]Guys, they're all the same fucking thing.
[279:17.15]They all get their meat from the same vendors.
[279:20.01]They all have the same people making the burgers.
[279:22.48]They all have the same fucking people, like, shipping the food out.
[279:25.52]It's all just a fucking joke.
[279:27.46]It's just baseball teams.
[279:29.54]That's not real differences.
[279:31.72]It's like the difference between people wearing a Red Sox uniform and a Yankees uniform.
[279:35.56]It's just the laundry.
[279:39.56]As Seinfeld very, very geniusly said, you're rooting for laundry.
[279:45.86]They're all the same fucking hamburgers.
[279:48.34]Except maybe on some of those restaurants, somebody's spitting them.
[279:55.22]They're all good.
[279:55.68]I don't know where we got, oh yeah, okay, right.
[280:00.24]Oh, tide laundry, yeah, tide pod, right?
[280:06.73]A chain is a chain.
[280:08.97]Well, you get the best burger.
[280:10.27]You actually get the best burger from the mom and pop shop where the guy's been making hamburgers there.
[280:16.44]He's like a 70-year-old dude.
[280:18.24]He's been making the same fucking cheeseburger for like 60 years.
[280:22.68]That's where you get the best burger.
[280:24.59]Chain-wise, they're all pretty much the same for me.
[280:27.43]I don't really see a difference.
[280:28.31]That huge of difference between any of the chain burger joints.
[280:33.77]We talked about fast food tiers here.
[280:35.53]I'm not talking about McDonald's is the same as In-N-Out.
[280:37.98]No, that's a different tier.
[280:39.86]That's shit tier.
[280:42.26]There's an S tier, there's an A tier, there's a B tier, there's a trash tier.
[280:48.78]I'm going to spit in yours.
[280:51.87]Thank you, Kaboosh, for the $1.
[280:53.07]You're a funny guy.
[280:54.79]This stream was fantastic.
[280:56.01]Thank you so much.
[280:57.97]Kaboosh.
[280:59.93]Thank you for the monetary contribution as well.
[281:02.27]Thank you, dude.
[281:04.20]And then, at the very end here, for real though, thank you for the bits, have you considered playing Euro Truck Simulator?
[281:11.56]No.
[281:13.38]No.
[281:15.52]I don't think so.
[281:17.28]I play enough, like, drive the car around video games that I feel like I'd be doing the same thing.
[281:23.31]I would try to crash the fucking car.
[281:26.25]Let me tell you exactly how a Euro Truck Simulator stream will go.
[281:31.41]I'm gonna get in the car.
[281:33.33]I'm going to start the car.
[281:34.99]I'm going to drive for about five minutes.
[281:36.73]And I'm going to try to drive over the medium.
[281:39.81]Car's going to flip.
[281:41.45]We're all going to laugh.
[281:43.19]And then I'm out of material.
[281:48.33]That's it.
[281:51.07]And speaking of that's it.
[281:53.23]Thank you so much, everybody, for sticking around.
[281:55.52]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[281:57.88]I've been feeling a little bit better, at least in the last few hours, so...
[282:02.07]Shit'll be fine.
[282:03.45]Take care, everybody.
[282:04.05]See you soon.
[282:05.43]Have a good rest of your night.
[282:07.03]Have a good weekend.
[282:07.89]See you tomorrow.
[282:09.22]Seven o'clock.
[282:10.50]Goodbye.
