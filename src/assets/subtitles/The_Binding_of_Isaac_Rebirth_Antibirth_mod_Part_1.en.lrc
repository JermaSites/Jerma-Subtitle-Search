[00:57.03]Hey, everybody.
[00:58.35]How are you?
[00:59.75]Hey.
[01:02.89]You know who I am?
[01:03.55]Or do you?
[01:05.76]You might be a brand new follower.
[01:06.92]I don't know.
[01:07.30]Let's find out.
[01:08.20]New guy.
[01:09.14]You in the back.
[01:09.90]Sitting there.
[01:10.28]You've been quiet.
[01:12.60]I'm Jerma.
[01:14.20]What's your name?
[01:16.69]David.
[01:17.91]That's a good name.
[01:18.93]David.
[01:19.21]I like it.
[01:20.90]Named after your father.
[01:22.06]Cool.
[01:23.04]So you're David Jr.
[01:23.88]then.
[01:24.80]David Jr.
[01:27.17]Cool.
[01:27.49]Very cool.
[01:28.79]Very nice.
[01:29.47]Hi guys.
[01:31.19]Good afternoon.
[01:31.59]Good evening.
[01:32.05]How are you?
[01:35.71]Good joke.
[01:38.21]We're going to play something tonight.
[01:41.07]We're going to play The Binding of Isaac.
[01:43.29]For the first time in a long time.
[01:46.96]I have not played Binding of Isaac in a while, but they just added a bunch of stuff.
[01:50.97]I'm not playing the thing that they just added officially.
[01:53.55]I'm playing the community mod.
[01:56.45]What?
[01:56.65]Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[02:01.63]His name is Isaac?
[02:03.21]What?
[02:05.15]I know.
[02:08.16]But thanks to all these new subs.
[02:09.26]Thank you, Beef Stew.
[02:10.18]MrFluffy67.
[02:12.60]11 months.
[02:13.90]Almost a year.
[02:15.98]Ajajaja 5.
[02:17.14]11 months.
[02:17.44]Bagel.
[02:17.84]Yeah.
[02:18.12]Thank you.
[02:20.04]Quagga.
[02:20.76]Thank you for the new sub.
[02:21.82]Acerda for 11 months.
[02:23.20]Scoop 5.
[02:23.96]Scoop 5 ever.
[02:27.61]Lime is here as well.
[02:28.95]Thank you.
[02:29.69]Magic stream.
[02:30.41]No.
[02:30.47]I'm not doing a magic stream.
[02:33.01]We're doing Binding of Lies extreme.
[02:37.67]The magic stream is going to be tomorrow and it's going to be insane.
[02:40.85]I wanted like an extra day to prepare for it.
[02:45.78]Get your failfishes ready.
[02:47.30]Yeah, this is Antibirth.
[02:48.10]This is not afterbirth plus, this is Antibirth.
[02:53.11]Because apparently afterbirth plus is not good.
[02:56.69]Not good at all, apparently.
[03:01.22]Let's move over to that.
[03:02.90]Just get started.
[03:03.58]And there it is.
[03:09.22]So, you're gonna call me a cheater.
[03:12.09]Let me make a tweet, though, first of all.
[03:16.47]Wait till some people get in there so I can kind of explain what's going on.
[03:20.57]Give the full explanation.
[03:23.51]Hey, thank you, Hobo, for the sub.
[03:26.16]Yeah.
[03:26.46]Glyph bin, eight months, an extra day to recharge mana.
[03:30.68]No, it's just that there's a couple of jokes that I want to do that are very, very important and, like, integral, integral to this working.
[03:41.67]So, you know.
[03:47.31]Need an extra day, but thank you for eight months, too.
[03:50.54]Beef stew.
[03:51.18]Thank you for the new sub.
[03:55.36]Minus three win streak.
[03:57.74]This is not my save file.
[04:00.30]Alright.
[04:04.28]Just like that.
[04:05.68]Just like that, we get started with a $100 drop in the pot there from Ruby.
[04:14.23]Thank you, Ruby.
[04:15.15]Ruby R. Ever so slightly inching his way to the $1,000 badge.
[04:23.51]That's a lot of money, my friend.
[04:28.42]Thank you so much, dude.
[04:32.04]Hopefully, uh...
[04:34.20]Hopefully it'll be worth it.
[04:36.18]Tomorrow, it's going to be worth it.
[04:37.08]Tomorrow.
[04:37.44]I'm just going to chill and play Binding of Isaac.
[04:40.78]And kind of get my body ready, prepared for tomorrow.
[04:44.26]Which tomorrow is the magic show.
[04:47.00]Full on.
[04:47.52]We're going like Twitch creative.
[04:48.90]I'm not playing a game tomorrow.
[04:51.12]We're doing full fucking magic show tomorrow.
[04:57.68]$100 joke.
[04:58.68]But thanks a lot, man.
[04:59.42]And thank you to CramZ13 for the new sub.
[05:01.94]Welcome.
[05:03.65]So after I made that little tweet, I'm just gonna wait a minute or two so I can explain what's going on.
[05:09.80]Hey, thanks, Lucas, for the four months.
[05:13.62]How long is the magic show gonna be?
[05:16.74]Probably like an hour or two.
[05:19.34]It's not... I have like 200 magic tricks.
[05:25.53]Oh my god, Boo just subscribed.
[05:26.77]Boo, I like need you.
[05:28.97]Boo, I like need you to be in a call with me to like tell me what items do.
[05:34.19]Thanks a lot, Boo.
[05:35.87]Boo, it's been a long time.
[05:37.95]No talk, by the way.
[05:38.85]Wait, what?
[05:40.22]Hope your life's going well.
[05:41.26]Hope all is going great.
[05:42.58]I haven't seen you in a while, man.
[05:46.94]Boo is in the chat right now.
[05:49.12]But thanks for eight months, dude.
[05:50.06]Much appreciated.
[05:53.32]And Latke.
[05:54.32]Thanks, Latke.
[05:55.54]And Ryman.
[05:57.86]But every time I used to play this game, Boo would just be in a call and I would just pick up an item and go, Boo, what's that do?
[06:04.47]And he'd go, oh, well, it does this.
[06:05.81]I'm like, oh, thanks, thanks.
[06:07.53]I pick up another item.
[06:08.17]Boo, what is that?
[06:09.05]What's the rotten tooth do?
[06:10.49]Oh, the rotten tooth does this.
[06:11.85]And I'm like, oh, thank God.
[06:15.65]But he's not here.
[06:17.33]And boo, this is Antibirth.
[06:18.45]This is like the new community thing.
[06:21.75]It's going to be kind of crazy, I think.
[06:24.49]I don't know.
[06:25.95]And with that, we've waited long enough.
[06:28.39]I think it's time to get started with The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth.
[06:34.49]This is not on Steam.
[06:36.35]This is a Rebirth mod.
[06:40.13]So if you're curious as to where to get this, you have to actually go to antebirth.com.
[06:44.86]I believe that's the name of the site.
[06:46.06]Somebody will link it.
[06:47.36]It's a complete and total, like, huge addition to the game.
[06:51.80]Not official.
[06:52.93]This is not official.
[06:53.95]You don't buy this on Steam.
[06:55.27]You just have to have Rebirth.
[06:57.99]And my win streak being minus three...
[07:00.75]I'll explain that.
[07:01.49]Take a look at how many Eden coins I have.
[07:05.47]Only 999.
[07:05.93]This is like the speedrun save file because I deleted my save file like a year ago.
[07:15.44]This is not my save file.
[07:16.84]I just wanted to make sure I had everything unlocked so when I put Antibirth, when I installed Antibirth, that it actually would have worked and like new items would have been involved.
[07:25.83]It was fairly difficult to install.
[07:31.10]The 999 Eden Coins.
[07:35.99]Thank you, RIP Dark Souls 2, for the sub.
[07:38.23]And Lime is here for the seven months.
[07:42.21]Thank you, J3W, for the bits.
[07:45.54]And Wet Cane, thanks for the bits as well.
[07:47.74]Lost... No, I haven't played this game in like a year.
[07:49.66]We're not doing... We're doing Cane.
[07:51.98]I'll start on hard, though.
[07:52.78]I will.
[07:53.00]Alright, let's go.
[07:56.78]Where are you?
[07:59.40]So, let me remember how to play Binding of Isaac.
[08:03.89]It's been a while.
[08:04.55]It should be in 60 frames, by the way, but it looks fine.
[08:08.87]Do Eden?
[08:11.73]I'm not sure I'm prepared to do Eden.
[08:13.77]Let me just get, like, a run or two where I actually know what the hell I'm doing.
[08:17.71]Good luck with that, too.
[08:19.73]Yeah.
[08:31.43]Just going for him.
[08:32.01]You gotta go for the big guy first.
[08:37.57]The little shit's gonna be killed later.
[08:39.85]Actually, he can kill them himself, can't he?
[08:41.13]Yeah, he can.
[08:42.25]Oh, look at that.
[08:42.71]Alright.
[08:45.88]Uh, this is Bob's rotten head.
[08:47.42]We'll just throw this thing.
[08:49.52]That's all I remember for that.
[08:51.58]Turn off the filter, my eyes.
[08:53.14]What do you mean, turn off the filter?
[08:54.72]Filter... No, I play with the filter on.
[09:01.29]I'm one of those pieces of shit that plays with the filter on.
[09:09.04]I don't like the way that looks.
[09:13.46]Oh, Robbie Rotten's, okay, what is it?
[09:14.92]L2?
[09:15.14]I don't remember.
[09:16.78]Hey, Boo, Boo, Boo, what does this do?
[09:23.13]How's that?
[09:26.25]I should not have started on hard.
[09:27.37]That was probably dumb, but, you know, who cares?
[09:29.49]Wait, what?
[09:33.94]Off, off, off.
[09:34.95]No, we're not doing a straw poll.
[09:36.53]I want to play like this.
[09:43.05]These first two items have been fucking awful, by the way.
[09:45.41]What do you think, Bob's Rotten Head or the Encyclopedia?
[09:52.00]Hey, Zirconium, thanks for the three months.
[09:54.60]You, Veins, for four months.
[09:56.56]Thank you, Spence, for the four months.
[09:58.76]The Toadman...
[10:00.58]So I'm going to keep Bob's Rotten Head.
[10:03.62]Off or riot?
[10:07.47]Look, you guys can riot all you want.
[10:12.71]You guys can have a riot for all I care.
[10:14.67]It's staying off.
[10:17.32]Hold on.
[10:19.76]I'm already getting angry.
[10:23.00]I don't want to pop the spider yet.
[10:25.80]Okay, now I do.
[10:33.72]I hate the little spiders.
[10:36.47]They're one of my least favorite enemies.
[10:39.37]Ooh, a key.
[10:44.71]Sorry I missed your last 50 streams.
[10:46.53]I was on a tea break.
[10:49.13]It's alright, dude.
[10:49.73]You don't have to be at every stream.
[10:51.35]Don't ever feel like you're under obligations to be here forever.
[10:55.06]You just come and hang out when you want to hang out.
[10:57.18]It's all good, man.
[11:00.46]Okay.
[11:01.92]I don't get this.
[11:10.30]Holy shit, that's a lot of those guys.
[11:18.95]My Bob's Rotten Head is ready.
[11:20.15]There's a new boss.
[11:23.27]Okay, is it L1 for a bomb?
[11:26.35]I'm not going up there yet.
[11:31.26]There's new music too, apparently.
[11:32.50]Shit, not good.
[11:42.09]Not good.
[11:43.97]Not good.
[11:48.75]Alright, can I get some stuff?
[11:51.45]Alright, I'm gonna take a guess.
[11:55.70]I'm gonna say it's right here.
[11:59.78]Haha!
[12:01.32]And it's just two bombs.
[12:02.38]Cool.
[12:04.76]Well, I guess I could.
[12:05.74]Can I blow this wall?
[12:08.60]I can, right?
[12:12.18]Whoa!
[12:13.80]Hold on a second there.
[12:14.76]What?
[12:19.09]Liberty cap.
[12:21.59]Boo!
[12:23.77]Boo, what's this do?
[12:25.37]What does a liberty cap do?
[12:28.37]Should I blow up the other mushrooms?
[12:30.67]I don't understand that.
[12:35.80]I blew up like... That was weird.
[12:38.04]I'm going to try that again.
[12:41.74]What the fuck?
[12:46.46]Boom.
[12:46.92]Random mushroom effect.
[12:48.14]Oh, look.
[12:52.52]999 coins in the donation box.
[12:54.70]I definitely did that on this legit save file.
[13:02.73]I don't have any money.
[13:08.07]Am I going to use a key if I open this?
[13:09.21]If I go through here?
[13:10.74]I hope not.
[13:13.77]Okay, whatever.
[13:14.31]I don't care.
[13:16.67]Ah, did I miss anything over here?
[13:18.06]I have one room.
[13:29.42]You fucker!
[13:39.21]That run sucked.
[13:40.09]That was fucking terrible.
[13:41.99]That was such a shit start.
[13:52.25]bullshit Well whatever that was a bad start.
[14:00.97]I got two shitty items to begin with See how much harder this one is this is the is that's my warm-up run.
[14:08.40]That's not even a real run Boo!
[14:20.98]I haven't played Isaac in a long time.
[14:22.22]Give me a break.
[14:24.26]Got me some slack.
[14:26.94]There is no greed mode.
[14:27.72]This is a rebirth expansion.
[14:31.28]This is not an Antibirth expansion.
[14:33.06]I'm not sure why I'm blowing out every fire, but I'm just doing it.
[14:38.09]Bombs are homing.
[14:38.97]Plus five bombs.
[14:41.69]Thank you, Goopkin, for three months.
[14:43.55]Upward Fern.
[14:44.71]Zirconium Flash.
[14:46.57]Thank you, Moda1209.
[14:47.29]Hold on a second.
[15:00.21]Go.
[15:01.27]Ah.
[15:07.01]Holy shit.
[15:08.43]Just eat it.
[15:10.33]I'm not dealing with that.
[15:12.68]There's so many champs.
[15:16.78]Okay, because I have like every single thing unlocked, there's like 10,000 champions now.
[15:22.39]The game's like five times harder.
[15:23.85]Ooh, coins.
[15:24.99]Alright, I gotta remember that's in here.
[15:32.76]Also, thank you to Waffle of Wonder for 10 months.
[15:35.96]Huffle, thanks for the new sub.
[15:38.70]Straight out of twitch.tv, thank you.
[15:42.20]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[15:43.34]And Blue Panda, thank you for the three months, dude.
[15:46.09]Welcome back.
[15:46.47]Okay, this one's not a terrible start.
[15:50.51]Oh, that's good, good.
[15:52.77]It's very hard.
[15:54.87]I like it.
[15:56.21]I like it a lot.
[15:59.09]That's what hard mode does?
[15:59.91]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[16:00.57]I'm just a little aware.
[16:02.17]I can see everything.
[16:02.87]What does the rainbow do again?
[16:11.33]I don't remember.
[16:14.29]Does it kill everything?
[16:20.46]I forgot what it did.
[16:21.40]I know the gold one is money.
[16:29.67]Yeah, but if I play on normal mode, you guys are all gonna call me a coward and call me, like, a bad streamer.
[16:35.39]So I have to play on hard mode, right?
[16:37.56]Isn't that how it works?
[16:50.06]Oh, it fills all your hearts now.
[16:55.31]Coward, coward, coward.
[17:13.70]Picking up coins may spawn more coins.
[17:16.26]How do you still know this shit after so long?
[17:18.10]Should I just kill the boss?
[17:21.89]Did I already get the item room?
[17:22.73]Oh yeah, let's just kill the boss.
[17:33.34]He explodes into a bunch of stuff, right?
[17:37.08]No, bugs.
[17:39.71]Just bugs.
[17:46.63]Alright.
[17:52.81]I have five bombs.
[17:53.67]I could go searching for the... Let's just go in here.
[17:59.02]Seven.
[17:59.68]What the hell is that?
[18:04.25]What is this cookie jar with the chocolate in it?
[18:06.07]What does that do?
[18:08.17]I can buy it.
[18:08.71]I can afford it.
[18:09.47]I can get that and I can get the spirit heart.
[18:13.15]Boo.
[18:13.77]Boo.
[18:21.51]Thank you, 98 Eclipse, for the three months.
[18:26.09]Obey the kitten.
[18:26.55]Thank you, the bits.
[18:27.63]Two bucks, dude.
[18:28.15]Appreciate that.
[18:32.71]It's pretty bad.
[18:33.33]Don't get it.
[18:35.29]I... Oh no, Boo doesn't know what it is.
[18:38.60]Boo doesn't know what that item does.
[18:40.06]What do we do?
[18:42.94]We're buying a spirit heart and we're leaving.
[18:46.50]Boo doesn't know.
[18:48.28]Wow.
[18:49.64]I'm surprised.
[18:52.72]Alright, we'll fuck that thing.
[18:55.76]Uh... Secret room.
[18:56.38]I don't care.
[18:59.31]Wait, did I already... I got the item, right?
[19:01.75]I did.
[19:02.19]Yeah, I'm not going through there.
[19:03.19]Fuck it.
[19:03.43]Let's kill the boss.
[19:04.09]Keep going.
[19:11.62]Gemini.
[19:21.02]Really?
[19:32.45]Still gonna stay.
[19:44.45]That's like damage.
[19:48.71]After this guy dies, yeah, he like freaks out, right?
[19:50.89]Yeah.
[20:00.64]Oh, he almost like cut me off there.
[20:10.65]Come on, you're so easy.
[20:16.91]Ooh, an injection.
[20:18.69]Experimental treatment, all stats up, then shuffled.
[20:23.51]Okay.
[20:26.73]Second phase.
[20:28.75]Can somebody teach this guy to move and shoot at the same time?
[20:30.97]I haven't played this fucking game in, like, a year.
[20:34.63]You're seeing it live, on camera.
[20:37.21]Come on.
[20:41.41]Oh, hey, Wimpy.
[20:41.89]What's going on, dude?
[20:44.43]I'm just gonna go.
[20:48.59]Would I have damage now?
[20:50.50]I just got more speed.
[20:52.88]I missed a rock?
[20:53.40]Where's the rock?
[20:55.38]Oh, that's the thing you say to an Isaac stream, right?
[20:59.18]He's like, wow, you missed a blue rock, you fucking idiot.
[21:02.11]Secret rock.
[21:02.73]I don't even... Where is it?
[21:04.87]Tinted rock.
[21:05.59]I don't see a tinted rock.
[21:07.11]Is it in the boss room?
[21:08.99]Ooh!
[21:09.89]There it is.
[21:10.37]There actually is.
[21:12.55]Nice.
[21:13.29]Oh, yeah.
[21:14.26]This is good.
[21:15.64]I'm ready to rock and roll now.
[21:22.35]Thank you, TwinDap, for the two months.
[21:23.45]98 Eclipse for the three months.
[21:26.47]Yarik, thanks for the new sub.
[21:27.53]HotSaltGuinBlade.
[21:31.28]Thank you, Will, for the bits.
[21:32.48]TripleNinja for 14 months in a row.
[21:34.16]What 14 months?
[21:35.12]And now I unsubscribed.
[21:36.22]What a joke.
[21:39.16]Thank you, GordonFisherman9VoltBluePanda for the subs.
[21:42.63]You guys rock.
[21:44.29]And ObeyTheKitten, thank you for those bits.
[21:46.73]Let's do it.
[21:51.28]You're in such a stupid place for me to... You know what?
[21:54.14]Go get him.
[21:58.08]That was such a waste, but I don't even care.
[22:02.30]I wasn't gonna, like, walk in there while he stuck up there.
[22:13.70]Key.
[22:19.29]Key!
[22:20.19]Let's go.
[22:22.46]What is that?
[22:24.02]Guillotine.
[22:27.02]What have I done?
[22:28.02]What does this do?
[22:33.46]Boo?
[22:36.33]Boo, what did I do?
[22:38.23]Press F7?
[22:50.54]This item sucks.
[22:51.62]Oh my god.
[22:52.38]What the fuck have I done?
[22:57.87]Is this... Alright.
[22:59.61]Is this... Oh, this is horrible.
[23:03.29]This is horrible.
[23:04.27]I don't like this at all.
[23:06.65]I don't like this and this one's terrible.
[23:14.36]Did it at least give me more damage?
[23:20.13]Oh my god, I hate this item.
[23:25.75]What have I done?
[23:32.35]Have fun with that.
[23:40.59]Get in there.
[23:41.81]Alright, what?
[23:44.00]Hold on.
[23:45.60]I got my own Wikipedia open.
[23:49.93]The guillotine.
[23:55.91]Damage up causes Isaac's head to detach and orbit his blocking shots and dealing seven contact damage.
[24:01.01]So wait, wait, that's actually good.
[24:08.54]This thing's not bad.
[24:09.28]This actually is pretty good.
[24:12.58]It blocks damage.
[24:13.82]Okay, whatever.
[24:16.84]I'm not going to go up there yet.
[24:18.85]I will and I'll come back down.
[24:22.65]Monstro!
[24:24.79]Dead.
[24:37.75]Is it a bar of soap?
[24:48.95]A bar of soap.
[24:51.83]Oh, this is getting good.
[24:53.11]This is getting good.
[24:53.97]Alright, devil room?
[25:00.41]Alright, what does the poo do?
[25:02.23]I know that's like a familiar.
[25:12.04]Is it worth taking the familiar?
[25:18.13]Is it the hairball?
[25:18.89]Oh, it's the hairball guppy.
[25:20.59]Leave.
[25:20.99]All is bad.
[25:21.79]No, no, no.
[25:23.95]Bad.
[25:24.81]Left one, left one, left one.
[25:27.88]Don't take either.
[25:29.96]Well, hold on a second.
[25:31.14]Let me see the guillotine.
[25:35.42]Oh, no.
[25:35.76]Never mind.
[25:38.22]Definitely get the hairball.
[25:40.44]Hairball, best item.
[25:45.35]Oh, what?
[25:45.91]Star wants me to go on team speak.
[25:51.16]Hold on a second, let's see why.
[25:56.40]What?
[25:59.06]Jeez, what does it do?
[26:01.26]What does what do?
[26:02.55]What does it do?
[26:03.83]What does anything do?
[26:04.97]I don't know.
[26:05.91]What do I do?
[26:07.81]Take the poop ball.
[26:09.97]No.
[26:10.67]You want me to take the poop ball?
[26:11.57]Why not?
[26:12.47]That counts as a piece of guppy now.
[26:13.97]Alright, I'm taking the poop.
[26:22.00]Trying to help.
[26:25.38]I want to keep exploring, though.
[26:26.82]I thought you were going to watch TV.
[26:28.10]What are you doing?
[26:29.28]I was, but then you started streaming and I came out to support my favorite streamer.
[26:33.00]Oh, thanks.
[26:33.54]I felt like I had to be here.
[26:35.86]I feel bad when I miss a game.
[26:37.02]Where's Boo?
[26:37.68]Boo's got to get in here, too.
[26:40.81]I need my item helpers to be in here.
[26:43.65]I'm going to accidentally walk into the fire.
[26:50.70]Alright, what does the textureless Mario block do?
[26:55.46]What does the white Mario block do?
[26:59.33]Is that the thing that repeats cards?
[27:00.99]The blank card?
[27:01.63]I don't know.
[27:05.27]The dilemma is I'm gonna have to wait to see it.
[27:06.79]Oh no, that gives you more options when you defeat bosses.
[27:09.83]You get an extra item option.
[27:11.73]Yeah, seven cents.
[27:12.62]Get that shit.
[27:13.52]Pick that shit up.
[27:14.24]More options.
[27:17.77]See, do you see my fucking donation box?
[27:19.23]Dude, I'm killing it right now.
[27:21.55]Oh my god, dude.
[27:23.05]This streamer gets so many donations.
[27:26.57]What?
[27:28.35]Where's Boo?
[27:29.63]Boo, I know you're there.
[27:32.33]Get in here.
[27:36.95]No more lurking, Boo.
[27:38.21]You're coming in this call to help with The Binding of Isaac.
[27:41.71]Boo doesn't want to talk to you.
[27:47.08]Money stream.
[27:47.74]Money stream?
[27:48.34]Is it a money stream?
[27:48.96]No, it's not.
[27:53.20]Is that Spencer from New York?
[27:55.64]Oh, get me in there.
[27:56.26]Come on.
[27:57.26]Stuff in there.
[27:57.76]Forget it.
[27:58.06]Just open it.
[27:59.80]I want it.
[28:03.48]Hearts.
[28:03.82]Good to know.
[28:04.38]Okay.
[28:05.44]Arcade.
[28:06.49]Should I go in there and try to double my money?
[28:09.99]Not yet.
[28:10.77]You should go in there and blow everyone up.
[28:14.01]Oh, damn.
[28:16.11]You said money stream, and all of a sudden, money appeared.
[28:20.51]Oh, what is this place?
[28:23.25]Boo!
[28:23.61]At the same time, everyone say boo.
[28:24.85]Ready?
[28:25.17]One, two, three.
[28:26.77]Boo!
[28:29.53]Did you not go in the curse room?
[28:31.39]No, I like to explore.
[28:33.05]I take my time.
[28:36.76]I don't just like to run in and freak out.
[28:38.76]You don't want to explore the curse room?
[28:40.76]Well, I don't want to take any unnecessary damage.
[28:45.19]I want to, like, look around first.
[28:47.13]You're calling... I'm going to blow up this wall, which is the secret room.
[28:50.97]See?
[28:52.75]Pick up the coins.
[28:57.63]Boo just comes in and says, like, one word and then goes, bye.
[29:00.24]But thank you, Will, for the $1,500.
[29:01.26]We're going to fill the donation box so you don't have to.
[29:05.76]Thank you also, Purple, for the $5.
[29:06.90]Big donations for Big Boy Streamer.
[29:09.96]Thank you.
[29:11.52]Does that actually... Will it hurt me if I go in?
[29:14.27]Yeah.
[29:14.91]It will.
[29:16.71]Yeah, but cursed rooms are worth it.
[29:18.67]Well, here's the situation.
[29:19.75]You have one piece of guppy.
[29:20.95]Pieces of guppy come in cursed rooms, so you want to go into every cursed room that you can afford to go into.
[29:25.51]Boo, I'm going to have to get the second opinion from the second doctor in the call, Boo.
[29:29.38]Cursed rooms are some of the most insane shit in the whole game.
[29:32.46]Okay, Boo, I need the second doctor that's in the call.
[29:34.78]Second doctor, second opinion, Boo.
[29:40.42]Is he here?
[29:40.87]Well, it's going to take a while.
[29:43.03]No, he's gone.
[29:44.91]No, I told you, he left.
[29:46.59]He even said in chat that he just wants to lurk.
[29:49.01]And you're trying... Oh my god.
[29:51.45]Do it.
[29:53.21]Cursive.
[29:53.63]Cursive.
[29:54.47]Cursive.
[29:55.23]Second opinion.
[29:56.85]Alright, this is two super mean hearts.
[30:02.56]Everyone's saying I'm loud, by the way.
[30:04.14]You're loud?
[30:04.76]Well, not everyone, but a couple people have said it.
[30:08.04]Well, let's turn you down, then.
[30:10.10]Yeah, no one should even hear me.
[30:11.58]Like, I should just be a whisper in your ear.
[30:13.13]You gotta turn it down.
[30:14.59]Alright, let's go.
[30:16.31]It was worth it.
[30:16.97]Thanks a lot.
[30:17.37]I'm glad to listen to that second opinion, Boo.
[30:19.97]Yeah, Boo's... You got it, mate.
[30:21.35]Okay, I... I actually have to go back to, like, lurking and leaving.
[30:24.27]I have a... I have a... I have one of those raids.
[30:28.29]But, Boo, it's good to talk to you again.
[30:29.94]We miss you.
[30:30.70]We love you.
[30:31.30]Who are you again?
[30:33.36]My name's Jeremy.
[30:36.42]Jeremy.
[30:38.28]Yes, Jeremy.
[30:38.76]You remember me?
[30:40.49]Everyone say that you love Boo.
[30:41.87]Say, Boo, we love you.
[30:43.33]You're the wrestler.
[30:44.67]Yeah.
[30:45.89]David, I'm such a huge fan.
[30:50.41]Let's talk soon.
[30:50.90]I have to go.
[30:51.72]Have fun.
[30:52.18]Take it easy, Boo.
[30:56.72]Should I be in the... Should I just blow up the casino?
[30:58.70]No, no, no, not yet.
[30:59.94]I know I can win more.
[31:00.74]Oh, God.
[31:04.46]Look at that coin.
[31:05.05]Check this.
[31:06.59]Ding dong!
[31:10.58]I like this music.
[31:11.42]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[31:20.74]When you go on the casino, Jerma, you need to go as aggressive as you possibly can.
[31:26.25]Yeah.
[31:26.61]And don't quit.
[31:27.57]Hey, guess what?
[31:28.25]Guess what I did, and guess who lost all their money?
[31:30.69]Did you really go to the casino?
[31:33.75]I guess I wasn't cool enough to come with you.
[31:35.69]It was like a New Year's Eve thing.
[31:37.98]Oh, so I guess, like, don't invite Star.
[31:39.49]Like, he has nothing better to do on New Year's Eve.
[31:42.91]This is like a plan.
[31:44.05]There was like, oh, there was four people in the hotel room.
[31:46.81]Do you want to sleep on the floor?
[31:47.75]I can get my own hotel room.
[31:50.57]This takes it from the Red Hearts, right?
[31:51.78]If I use the machine.
[31:54.60]Yeah.
[31:57.46]Ooh, a dime!
[32:07.00]This runs, look it up.
[32:12.01]One more coin and then we'll blow on it up.
[32:13.49]One more.
[32:15.43]Alright, that's it, goodbye.
[32:16.39]I think that was pretty successful.
[32:24.32]Give me one second, let me say hello too.
[32:27.58]Thank you Nick for the sub.
[32:28.38]DarthButtCrust for 13 months.
[32:29.88]ArmedFatAssed, FastestFudge, NaderJames,
[32:34.27]Kawaii Boy for three months.
[32:37.01]If you die, I'm unsubscribing.
[32:40.23]I'm obviously gonna die eventually.
[32:41.99]Bert Glick.
[32:43.68]Hold on a second, I'm talking to Twin Depp, I'm talking to 98 Eclipse, I'm talking to this guy, hold on.
[32:50.12]We're talking about Never Trust a Purple.
[32:51.84]Totally Liam Neeson for the five bucks.
[32:55.71]Also.
[32:57.15]Oh!
[33:04.81]A hundred fucking dollars right now from Ruby R. That guy's got too much money.
[33:12.05]Ruby, you have a lot of money.
[33:13.53]He just has to get rid of it all.
[33:15.93]Ruby, that's $200 tonight from Ruby.
[33:20.43]Can we all, for the sake of Ruby, go into the options and turn the filter off?
[33:25.15]No.
[33:25.45]Ugh.
[33:28.88]Everyone thinks that you're bad at the game because you have the filter on.
[33:31.76]It looks like a Game Boy game.
[33:33.14]I like it when it looks like a Super Nintendo game.
[33:35.78]It looks like the Photoshop pastel filter.
[33:38.99]And you have a problem with that.
[33:40.33]That's not a... Everyone does, because you're like... The impression is like you're playing on hard because you want people to think you're good, right?
[33:47.43]When people see the filter, they know it was a lie.
[33:55.03]Look how happy Chad is.
[33:56.71]I just, I don't, it looks too jagged.
[33:58.69]It looks like bad anti-aliasing.
[34:02.95]Oh no, and look, I turned off the filter and now I don't know where I'm going.
[34:05.77]What is that, by the way?
[34:07.89]What is that?
[34:10.25]I'm ten minutes behind.
[34:11.22]Wait, what?
[34:13.68]New enemy.
[34:14.94]What's that?
[34:15.36]New enemy.
[34:18.70]Whoa, that was kind of crazy.
[34:27.23]I'm so fast right now.
[34:30.83]Ow!
[34:31.19]God dammit, that just gets the shit out of me.
[34:35.44]Wheel of Fortune.
[34:37.58]Uh, sure, why not.
[34:41.78]Uh, okay, sure.
[34:42.60]Um, Lucky Rock.
[34:43.52]There's something inside of it.
[34:47.22]Lucky Rock.
[34:47.76]What's a Lucky Rock do, Star?
[34:49.66]Uh, that sounds new.
[34:51.97]I'm not familiar with a lucky rock.
[34:54.59]It's probably like lucky poop.
[34:57.03]Whenever you destroy rocks, it probably has money in it, I would guess.
[35:02.01]I'm going to look it up.
[35:05.27]But thank you.
[35:06.19]Before we go any further, like, Ruby, thanks for the fucking $10,000.
[35:08.32]Thanks for the $100.
[35:09.52]Just destroy a rock.
[35:11.58]Hold on.
[35:12.76]I'm trying to say thanks to somebody for giving me $100 fucking dollars.
[35:16.52]Ruby, it's like every day to him.
[35:19.44]He's, like, sick of being thanked.
[35:22.87]Thank you, Ark, who's inky the plot for 13 months and razzle for the $5.
[35:27.01]Hey, do you know what a whale is?
[35:30.25]Yeah, I do.
[35:33.74]What's the two hearts do again?
[35:34.66]That's the... you just get hearts.
[35:36.56]Yeah.
[35:38.50]I'm blowing this thing up now.
[35:39.50]Fuck it.
[35:43.04]Oh, now it's got this... it's the weird worm.
[35:45.29]Flatworm.
[35:46.39]Actually, that's pretty good, isn't it?
[35:47.85]Isn't the flatworm good?
[35:50.01]It's like a little bit more hit frames.
[35:56.87]Everything is just great.
[35:58.91]I'm gonna keep this.
[36:02.20]I'll be back.
[36:02.76]I'll be back.
[36:03.44]I'll come back here.
[36:04.34]I think it gives you a higher ting rate.
[36:09.46]It should.
[36:15.71]Can't get in there.
[36:18.19]Yeah, it gives you better hit rate, see?
[36:21.79]Better slick rate.
[36:26.85]Well, the problem is that it takes the spot of a trinket, and it doesn't really actually do anything.
[36:33.72]Hey, you play your game.
[36:34.74]I'll play my game.
[36:36.52]I'm just trying to help.
[36:37.32]That's why I'm here.
[36:37.92]Well, you didn't think you were going to get the face mask.
[36:43.25]This is like, I now win the game.
[36:45.01]Because I have the face mask, right?
[36:49.37]Yeah.
[36:50.13]Wow.
[36:50.71]You win the game now.
[36:56.23]I feel like I'm doing a lot of damage.
[36:57.29]I feel like I'm shooting a lot of bullets.
[36:58.49]I think this one's gonna be alright.
[37:02.81]The only problem I'm having right now is, like, actually, like, trying to run over items that I don't know where they are.
[37:07.18]What does the mask do?
[37:08.86]You take, you get half damage, right?
[37:10.58]It blocks damage, blocks projectiles that hit you in the face.
[37:14.88]Hey, Platypus, thanks for the 10 bucks, dude.
[37:17.31]They say top tier stream.
[37:18.95]Thanks, man.
[37:21.29]You just guessed like three different things, which one is it?
[37:24.33]It's blocks damage when it hits you in the face.
[37:27.09]No.
[37:27.81]And it's half damage.
[37:29.85]No.
[37:30.95]What does it do?
[37:36.17]I don't think I want anything in that room.
[37:37.47]You're going to want to buy that soul heart because you're going to take 10 damage from the boss.
[37:44.99]What the fuck is that enemy?
[37:51.01]Oh, my lord.
[37:52.35]Okay.
[37:53.01]That's just really freaking me out.
[37:54.97]What just happened?
[37:55.54]Oh.
[38:00.40]Whoops.
[38:03.52]Was there a secret room that I missed?
[38:08.31]Hold on a second.
[38:12.19]Yeah, there it is.
[38:18.09]I got it.
[38:18.39]I got it.
[38:18.87]I, like, knew it was here.
[38:19.75]Come on, man.
[38:23.02]Whoops, I dropped my hearts.
[38:26.56]I gotta be more careful.
[38:27.34]It's time to not be an idiot.
[38:36.25]Was that you that made a noise or was that in the game?
[38:37.59]I don't know.
[38:38.01]I think it was in your room.
[38:44.64]Peep.
[38:58.26]Ah, it hit me in the body.
[39:01.70]Shit, this thing sucks.
[39:07.65]This item is super awkward.
[39:08.99]I can't tell where I'm actually moving.
[39:15.51]Well, that's... The coat hanger is extra tiers.
[39:19.61]The mushroom is... I'm not sure which one is better.
[39:22.72]Blue mushroom or the coat hanger?
[39:25.95]Uh, I think the coat hanger.
[39:27.38]I don't remember what the blue mushroom does, but coat hanger's good.
[39:31.86]Yeah, let's get it.
[39:33.70]Tears up.
[39:34.88]Oh, wait, no.
[39:35.74]I need that mushroom.
[39:36.98]That's a lot of tears, though.
[39:41.80]Alright, uh, guys, everyone's mad at me that I picked up the right item.
[39:44.74]I'm listening to my doctor star that's in the car specifically to help me.
[39:46.93]I can't remember what the mushroom does.
[39:50.03]I can't remember, guys.
[39:51.33]You are going, everybody.
[39:52.29]I failed.
[39:53.11]Everybody's gonna flip the fuck out now.
[39:58.47]But now you have more tears.
[40:00.29]Yeah, I got to shoot more.
[40:02.31]Yeah, and you're like a chimpanzee with a machine gun.
[40:06.90]It's like a chimpanzee with a machine gun.
[40:09.64]Did I miss anything?
[40:10.18]Did I miss the item room?
[40:10.84]Did I miss anything?
[40:11.34]Did I miss that thing?
[40:11.96]Let me just explore a little bit.
[40:15.74]Hold on.
[40:16.58]Should I hang up the coat?
[40:18.33]Whoops.
[40:24.19]I don't remember these guys.
[40:27.99]Okay.
[40:29.71]There it is.
[40:30.05]There's the item room.
[40:30.77]I didn't get it.
[40:31.95]Ooh, the super spoon.
[40:33.87]Homing shots.
[40:37.37]What does that do?
[40:38.79]Do the shots send you home?
[40:40.89]Yeah, you go back to home.
[40:46.47]Uh, did I miss any subs?
[40:47.39]Nightfang X. Thank you for the four months.
[40:51.78]Let's just get out of here.
[40:52.52]Keep going.
[40:55.97]Dude, I am so fast.
[41:00.31]Actually, I don't like being this fast.
[41:01.81]It, like, screws me up.
[41:09.70]In the caves.
[41:11.22]Uh, where's that room?
[41:12.08]I don't know.
[41:19.89]Damn.
[41:22.66]These little- I'm shooting these little jelly- homing jelly beans is fantastic.
[41:32.84]I wanna try playing with one of the new characters.
[41:34.41]Just wanted to get a good, like, decent run-up.
[41:36.89]Um, you know.
[41:37.27]Alright, uh... Star says go in the curse room, right?
[41:44.09]That's- is that a curse room?
[41:46.89]Is that something else?
[41:48.47]What the hell is that?
[41:49.11]That's a battle room.
[41:49.83]You can ignore those.
[41:51.31]Well, no.
[41:52.19]You gotta catch up.
[41:54.11]Yeah.
[41:55.49]That's a curse drum.
[41:56.27]I mean, I'm gonna... Is it worth going in there to potentially get three hearts?
[42:02.96]Yeah!
[42:05.06]But I... Here's something you don't understand.
[42:06.50]I'm not good.
[42:08.30]I'm, like, bad.
[42:08.94]I need help.
[42:09.32]Okay, okay.
[42:09.56]Here's what you do, then.
[42:11.22]Do the boss, and if you still have soul hearts left afterwards, because you don't want to take red heart damage before the boss...
[42:17.78]So, like, give yourself that safety net, but then come back if you can.
[42:21.48]Come on!
[42:22.76]Wow.
[42:29.57]What's that?
[42:30.33]What does that do?
[42:34.03]Triple A battery.
[42:38.03]And... Petrified poop.
[42:41.66]And money and shit.
[42:44.78]I don't have anything to charge, so...
[42:47.94]Isn't the petrified poop you blow up poop and it gives you money?
[42:51.74]Yeah.
[42:53.38]I'll take that for now and come back in here.
[43:01.47]Jeez.
[43:02.97]I don't like these Slimer bugs.
[43:04.63]I don't like them at all.
[43:10.65]Jeez, man.
[43:11.65]Come on.
[43:13.71]Why do I get out of here?
[43:15.92]Ugh.
[43:19.92]Hey, remember that your head blocks shots.
[43:42.68]Yeah, I know.
[43:43.92]Yeah.

[43:45.80]M&M?
[43:45.88]Let's get the M&M.
[43:48.66]You feel refreshed and protected.
[43:59.49]What, did somebody say I was bad at the game or something?
[44:02.01]Well, to my defense, this is the first time I've played the game in like a year, and this is like a fan-made community expansion.
[44:11.44]I'm not going for like super speedrun beat the boss in 10 minutes.
[44:14.75]I'm just playing Isaac for the first time in like a year.
[44:19.13]If you don't want to watch that, then that's the way it is.
[44:23.75]Hey, just calm down.
[44:24.62]The real Dremel fans know that.
[44:28.36]We're just here for the wild ride.
[44:31.98]It is a wild ride.
[44:38.30]Yeah, I'm going to kill the boss and then whatever.
[44:41.46]Gemini.
[44:42.26]Two Geminis.
[44:43.43]Uh-oh.
[44:47.51]This is a big area.
[45:07.59]Oh god damn it.
[45:09.33]Ah, it was just like it spawned like right on top of me, and I couldn't do anything about it How fast I am this is insane And a devil room open to Shit god damn it.
[45:27.93]I forget his fucking patterns Told you not to go in
[45:45.17]Alright, well at least I get the coal, right?
[45:48.55]Lump of coal.
[45:51.17]What does that do?
[45:52.23]Isn't the thing that, like, it hurts the more it travels or something?
[45:55.62]Yeah!
[46:01.72]Ster is nice today.
[46:05.50]What was this?
[46:06.50]The Fool.
[46:07.08]Isn't this bringing it to the, what, item room or something?
[46:09.08]I forget.
[46:09.88]The starting location.
[46:11.34]Dumbass, you fool.
[46:12.62]Wait, what?
[46:16.08]Hey, Paper, thanks for three months.
[46:17.24]Sam, thanks for the five bucks.
[46:18.60]I personally come to your streams to learn your six speedrunning strats.
[46:21.26]Well, look at how fast I'm going now.
[46:22.44]You'll learn something.
[46:24.54]Hey, you gotta get to the room before 20 minutes, otherwise you can't do boss rush.
[46:27.83]Is that even in Rebirth?
[46:32.63]Yeah.
[46:36.10]Aww.
[46:44.29]It's showing me the same pack every time, man.
[46:47.07]It's been here like three times.
[46:48.27]Are you going back to the curse room?
[46:54.81]Uh, yeah, I will.
[46:58.12]I'm not trying to pressure you or anything.
[47:00.74]Yeah, I mean, I'm going to lose this good heart, but you know, whatever.
[47:04.86]Let's go down first.
[47:18.27]Did I lose my homing?
[47:19.13]I feel like it's not homing anymore.
[47:22.99]The coal just makes the color different.
[47:30.02]Also, your shot speed might be so high that it's not homing as much.
[47:32.54]I can't even home, yeah.
[47:33.40]Alright, curse room.
[47:39.68]Here we go!
[47:46.41]A tongue.
[47:48.94]Judas's Tongue.
[47:49.74]Payment received.
[47:53.60]I don't think I've ever known what that item does.
[47:56.44]Which probably means it's bad and you should keep the poop.
[48:00.50]Um, I kind of want to go back and get the other thing that I dropped.
[48:08.84]Good hearted streamer.
[48:14.39]Eh, I don't even care.
[48:15.31]Let's just go.
[48:22.17]Helps with devil deals.
[48:23.53]I've had a lot of them so far.
[48:27.43]Oh, they cost one heart only devil deal rooms.
[48:29.77]Oh, that is really good.
[48:31.09]That is actually really good.
[48:32.49]I'm going to hold on to it then.
[48:35.12]Hey, take damage.
[48:35.88]Go back in the curse room.
[48:38.76]Oh, no, you already had it.
[48:39.50]Never mind.
[48:41.16]Wow.
[48:41.66]You learn something new every day that you learn something new.
[48:44.04]Mm-hmm.
[48:49.44]I like the poop though.
[48:50.36]Curse room already, curse room.
[48:52.68]He gets so much money and then with the money you can buy power.
[49:00.15]Oh, dropped.
[49:04.69]I don't know what these are.
[49:05.63]These are like piranha plants from fucking Super Mario Brothers 2.
[49:07.93]Okay, they're gone, they're gone.
[49:10.31]That was a lot of new enemies that I've never seen before.
[49:23.60]Hey, they are still homing, but it's not going that fast.
[49:29.61]Goodbye, and goodbye.
[49:38.39]I missed a rock where?
[49:48.33]Is there a rock?
[49:53.39]You guys trolling me today?
[49:54.19]Did I miss a rock?
[49:56.26]Shit.
[49:59.90]Don't let him get to you.
[50:00.84]I don't know why I took damage there.
[50:03.96]That was so unnecessary.
[50:04.78]I could have just run into everybody.
[50:07.06]I just forget everything.
[50:08.08]The rock's in the wall.
[50:09.84]You didn't see it.
[50:15.87]Sloth!
[50:22.90]The world.
[50:24.03]Just use it and take it again.
[50:25.25]Wait, what did you say was in the long room?
[50:34.17]The long one, yeah.
[50:36.23]Where?
[50:38.56]Tiny little X on a rock.
[50:40.88]Oh.
[50:41.82]I forgot that that even existed.
[50:54.74]There's some of the blue flames too.
[50:56.32]If you like put them out or if you blow them up or something like those great hearts.
[51:02.34]The blue fires.
[51:07.74]Somebody will know.
[51:16.59]Oh, I hate the turkeys.
[51:17.43]They're like champion turkeys.
[51:24.03]They're the worst.
[51:32.28]You blow up those blue flames, you have a chance to get soul hearts.
[51:35.89]Yeah, that's what I figured.
[51:38.73]That's what I figured.
[51:42.27]Yeah.
[51:51.04]Secret.
[51:53.72]Hmm... Should I...
[52:07.21]Come on!
[52:09.38]Come on!
[52:11.64]Come on!
[52:14.78]What the fuck is that?
[52:18.16]Paperclip, master of unlocking.
[52:27.73]Did I just get a piece of shit item for that?
[52:34.17]Yes, you did.
[52:37.78]So I can just keep the tongue?
[52:39.94]Yeah.
[52:44.57]Reset.
[52:46.99]Thank you, UpwardFern, for the five bucks.
[52:48.45]Hey, Jerma, if you do another Jerma Rumble in real life, can I please build you a real championship belt, like a WWE belt?
[52:55.38]I don't know.
[52:57.22]That might be fun to do something like that.
[52:59.14]I don't know when the next one's going to be, but it'd be fun to have a custom belt.
[53:03.60]And thank you, Magpie, for the three bucks.
[53:05.09]$3.70. $3.70.
[53:07.67]I said this earlier, but stream got reset.

[53:13.19]Thank you.
[53:15.31]Jermaheit.

[53:51.44]Come on.
[53:51.98]Please, please, please.
[53:58.80]You shouldn't gamble when you have 15 coins, man.
[54:01.62]I gamble.
[54:02.96]That's what I do.
[54:04.98]15 coins is what you need to buy good things.
[54:07.84]Those good things aren't going to even appear anymore.
[54:11.10]They're all gonna get sucked out.
[54:12.14]Alright, last one!
[54:17.84]Okay, I got- I replaced my- Great, got one key.

[54:41.56]Oh, well.
[54:43.20]Should I just sprint?
[54:44.34]I'm fast enough.
[54:45.88]Should I just take... Fuck off, yeah!
[54:51.37]Whoa!
[54:54.41]God damn it!
[54:55.75]I gotta, like, turn the gamma up.
[54:56.83]I can't see anything.
[55:04.51]I need to find a super secret room.
[55:06.55]It's, like, probably right here somewhere.
[55:11.11]Oh, what a god.
[55:13.19]Take the paperclip?
[55:14.43]Alright, hold on.
[55:15.21]What's a paperclip do?
[55:16.01]Did you just say you have to find the secret room?
[55:18.76]No, the super secret room.
[55:22.10]Isn't there two secret rooms and there's a super secret room on everything?
[55:26.00]It's like usually attached.
[55:26.74]Oh, yeah.
[55:27.22]Right, yeah.
[55:28.96]But wouldn't you be able to see it because you have the Google vision?
[55:32.08]I thought so.
[55:38.08]Whatever.
[55:39.12]Also, I think I am... I don't know who this is.
[55:43.21]This is a new boss.
[55:44.89]I think I'm still too loud.

[55:55.42]I don't know what to do.
[55:56.08]I don't know what he does.
[56:08.95]I hate the detached body thing.
[56:11.35]Jesus!
[56:11.85]Honest to God, the detached body thing, it's gonna ruin the whole run.
[56:27.21]I'm like, I'm moving with my head, not my body.
[56:33.15]Jesus Band-aid or range up.

[57:29.83]Not close at all.
[57:30.37]I have one piece.
[57:37.20]Probably top left of the super secret.

[57:55.55]PapaJohn6969, thank you.
[57:58.52]Would I rather eat 50 nuggets or one nugget 50 times the size of regular nuggets?
[58:03.38]You can save them, you can put them in your fridge, you can reheat them.
[58:05.78]Can't do that with one big nugget, it would be gross.
[58:09.16]But thanks a lot, guys.
[58:16.95]That's kind of close.
[58:19.39]Rip paperclip.
[58:22.89]No, we're using the Judas's elbow, whatever it's called.
[58:27.01]Bad!
[58:39.25]I guess I'm getting keys.
[58:44.15]These secret rooms have been so bad.
[58:45.63]Do you want a battery?
[58:48.63]No, I don't want a battery.
[58:57.02]Stupid guillotine.
[58:58.40]I wish Boo was in the call when the guillotine appeared.
[59:04.02]Not me.
[59:05.18]Oh, did you notice it?
[59:08.30]What am I even doing here?
[59:10.94]You're kind of just like here.

[59:36.36]Hold on.
[59:37.72]You shouldn't be too loud.
[59:40.51]I think I am a little bit.
[59:41.93]I just turned it down again.
[59:42.71]Because I'm mumbling, so I don't want to speak up because I sounded loud on the stream to myself.
[59:47.59]I don't know.
[59:49.49]You know, good day.
[59:50.09]We played with D&D this morning.

[63:36.77]Sure, I'll take a... I'll explode a bomb to get a free bomb.
[63:42.20]Oh, fuck me.
[63:43.08]I don't like this room.
[63:48.40]It's annoying, but watch this.
[63:49.96]When you're in the corner like that, and you're shooting, the head just gets stuck in the wall and shoots the fucking wall.
[63:56.15]That's great.
[64:05.46]Is it like the buddy?
[64:07.28]Bum friend.
[64:08.82]Oh, he picks up the money.
[64:09.88]Alright.
[64:12.18]Oh, look, even more shit.
[64:14.02]Yeah, he picks up money.
[64:15.52]Even more shit on the screen that I can't even see where the hell I'm going.
[64:17.87]Alright, um... More trash in the item room.
[64:21.17]Except for, what's that?
[64:25.87]I helped.
[64:27.47]It's like a head with, it's like pins sticking out of it?
[64:29.81]Um, I'm gonna have to wait to see it.
[64:34.39]I think that's a new item in Annie Birth, I have no idea.
[64:39.52]Really?
[64:39.96]Really.
[64:42.69]Anybody know what that what that thing is?
[64:44.87]Let's see if I can find it on my little thing.
[64:46.47]I don't see it on here.
[64:57.93]Dude, I can see it's it's any birth like it's new stuff.
[65:02.11]It's new content.
[65:02.95]People want to see the new cool things.
[65:06.39]You put a bomb on the donation machine, get some money from your cheater box.
[65:14.78]Gives you two curse rooms per floor instead of one.
[65:19.70]Should I do that shit?
[65:21.92]Good for God.
[65:22.46]Let's do it.
[65:22.96]Why not?
[65:23.28]Screw it.
[65:23.79]More curses.
[65:24.41]Go ahead.
[65:26.53]Why not?
[65:29.57]Why not?
[65:35.21]Alright, is this like, do I have like a weird seed where like every room has spikes in it?
[65:40.87]I have the spike seed, for some reason.
[65:45.04]I'm not going over there, let's just... Let's go.
[65:57.12]Probably drop a bomb.
[66:06.22]You can beat him.
[66:10.24]You got this.
[66:12.80]Yeah, you got this dude.
[66:21.32]Just like you got invited to my wedding and didn't come.
[66:29.14]He didn't get invited to your wedding, actually.
[66:31.48]Let's get the record straight there.
[66:34.21]Alright, there's the negative and the Polaroid.
[66:35.71]It's just which one of these you show to Isaac and you get the good ending, or you show to Megashayton and you get the Megashayton ending, right?
[66:41.67]Um, you want the Polaroid, the bright one.
[66:47.09]The white one.
[66:48.35]That one's more fun.
[66:49.75]Cool, let's go.
[66:51.71]Though any birth is probably different, I don't know.
[66:56.94]Utero 1, Nuki.
[67:02.69]Thank God I got in the way of that.
[67:05.37]No.
[67:06.63]Not doing that room.
[67:07.43]We're going to go in these other rooms.
[67:08.91]Ooh, super hard.
[67:12.94]Don't really need it right now.
[67:16.54]Oh, dear.
[67:17.00]Oh, I couldn't even see what the hell's still living in here.
[67:31.64]Well, Star didn't come to my nugget stream, that's right.
[67:36.02]Hey, you didn't come to my chicken nugget stream.
[67:39.68]What is this?
[67:40.70]What are these things?
[67:43.24]They just explode?
[67:47.00]You don't even come to my nugget stream, dude.
[67:49.61]What was the nugget stream?
[67:50.69]I missed it.
[67:51.17]I don't even know.
[67:51.87]You missed it.
[67:53.01]I ate 50 nuggets on stream on social eating.
[67:56.27]Did you really?
[67:57.03]Yeah, it took me like fucking 40 minutes.
[67:58.45]It was crazy.
[68:00.41]I've been waiting for that stream.
[68:01.75]It was on the fat... It was on the front page of r slash fat fuck.
[68:06.03]The fat page?
[68:07.93]Oh.
[68:09.30]Was it?
[68:09.74]Yeah, it was on r slash fat fuck.
[68:12.44]That sounds made up.
[68:16.64]I can't believe you didn't come to my nugget stream, dude.
[68:18.46]What is up with you?
[68:22.66]My first active item for like the whole game.
[68:26.98]Go in the curse room?
[68:28.16]Yay!
[68:30.78]Matchstick.
[68:32.02]No, I don't want the matchstick.
[68:40.40]I can see everything.
[68:41.70]Yeah, you can.
[68:42.80]Please pick that back up and... Woo!
[68:49.82]What's going on?
[68:51.72]Oh, it's a little pee-pee.
[69:02.74]Alright, curse room.
[69:05.56]Ooh, fires.
[69:07.16]Hey, don't make fun of it, guys.
[69:08.24]Shoop-de-woop.
[69:09.08]It's funny.
[69:10.16]That joke will never die.
[69:11.26]Did I get it?
[69:15.56]Yes, but it doesn't matter.
[69:17.90]No, Guppy's still in here.
[69:20.98]So I just take damage.
[69:22.40]Fuck the curse rooms, man.
[69:25.40]It's too late for Guppy anyways.
[69:26.89]I don't even want it.
[69:33.70]These things are really freaking me out.
[69:34.96]I don't even know what the fuck they're doing.
[69:48.63]Wrong door?
[69:49.13]What do you mean wrong door?
[69:52.33]What happened?
[69:53.07]What did I do?
[69:56.15]What did I do?
[69:56.53]I don't know.
[69:58.38]What did you do?
[70:01.04]Oh, I, uh... Okay, laugh it up.
[70:03.70]Yeah, laugh it up.
[70:04.64]The secret room went down.
[70:05.82]You know, it's alright.
[70:07.74]Gotta laugh it up.
[70:08.38]Don't worry about it.
[70:16.29]Can I tell you I haven't played Binding of the Eyes in like a year?
[70:18.11]Come on, laugh it up.
[70:21.41]Let's hear it.
[70:24.85]Stick your head out.
[70:28.73]Can you please stick your head out?
[70:41.60]Sometimes you make mistakes in these games.
[70:43.61]It's okay.
[70:45.85]Wait, what?
[70:54.73]Wait, wait.
[70:56.31]That's not guppy.
[70:57.89]I thought the cat was like a guppy thing.
[71:03.44]Star!
[71:04.58]Star, what did I do?
[71:07.24]You told me like this has more guppy shit and I did was that that's not gonna Fucking why are you disappointed that you've got one of the best items in the whole game?
[71:15.17]That's a piece of guppy.
[71:16.13]You can die nine times now.
[71:18.10]It's a piece Star star what star
[71:37.86]Oh, can you not get out of the door?
[71:39.26]I can't get out of the fucking door!
[71:42.30]You told me this was a good idea?
[71:47.91]You picked it up before I said it was a good idea.
[71:49.85]I didn't know it was on my screen.
[71:52.33]I can't get out!
[71:54.41]Can you bomb up?
[71:56.23]I'm gonna have to try anything right now.
[71:57.93]Also, yeah, I think if you kill yourself with a bomb, you appear out of the room.
[72:10.99]Oh!
[72:13.06]Fucking god damn it.
[72:13.98]Alright, I just need to, I just need to... Calm down, I'm fine.
[72:26.72]Everything's fine.
[72:27.32]I didn't, nothing, we're good, we're fine, we're fine.
[72:29.53]We just need some items.
[72:30.55]Just can't get touched.
[72:37.43]Is easier said than done.
[72:46.66]Oh, God.
[72:48.34]God.
[72:51.63]God.
[72:54.59]Okay.
[72:56.71]Fucking curse rooms, man.
[72:57.65]I swear to God.
[72:58.75]I don't want to even use them.
[73:00.77]But you get two per floor.
[73:01.82]I don't care.
[73:02.48]Like, I don't, like... You need one more piece of guppy.
[73:05.80]Yeah, I need one more piece of guppy.
[73:08.00]Don't you like cats?
[73:09.20]Pretty crats?
[73:09.78]Don't you like pretty crats?
[73:10.66]I love cats, but I mean, when it comes down to me having one heart, when I haven't played this game in a year.
[73:16.81]Do you understand how good Guppy is?
[73:18.53]I know he's good, but guess what?
[73:19.81]I've died with Guppy before.
[73:21.15]Like, on stream.
[73:21.93]It happened like a year and a half ago.
[73:24.37]And I lost my gamer license, remember?
[73:26.78]Guppy isn't always good.
[73:28.76]Like, sometimes you have a really shitty build and Guppy won't even save it.
[73:31.62]What happened?! !
[73:37.81]What happened?
[73:41.57]I'm waiting to see.
[73:42.53]What happened?
[73:44.79]And why is this here?
[73:45.67]Oh, you got hit by the last guy.
[73:55.39]The last little head hit you.
[73:57.33]There's too many things on the screen.
[74:00.64]Alright, shh.
[74:02.32]I'm doing it.
[74:14.62]Tracy, don't blame me.
[74:15.44]Blame the fact that I can't even see where my character is.
[74:18.18]That's my excuse.
[74:18.88]The stupid guillotine.
[74:20.53]Hey, get a new prescription.
[74:23.59]Open your mouth.
[74:26.15]It's open, daddy.
[74:27.43]Oh.
[74:28.65]Easy.
[74:31.43]Easy.
[74:32.75]What?
[74:33.25]Super secret.
[74:34.89]Oh, yes!
[74:36.13]Alright, let's do it.
[74:39.77]Territorial.
[74:40.31]I don't know what this is.
[74:40.93]It's over.
[74:41.19]Now I know what this is.
[74:42.65]It's easy.
[74:43.56]Guys, easy.
[74:52.74]Blew up on top of me.
[74:53.76]Dog food.
[74:54.86]Wait, which... These are both health up.
[74:57.01]Which one of these is more health up?
[74:58.05]Dog food or the red ice cream?
[75:01.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[75:03.13]What?
[75:03.89]Which one?
[75:04.27]Dog food or red ice cream?
[75:05.51]Which one gives you more health up?
[75:09.73]Dog food.
[75:10.80]The red ice cream is damage up.
[75:14.40]Okay, I think.
[75:16.94]Red ice cream.
[75:20.11]Everyone's calling you incorrect now.
[75:23.99]No, clot is damaged.
[75:26.91]Take the dog food.
[75:28.35]Okay, here's the thing.
[75:29.47]It doesn't even fucking matter.
[75:30.95]And yeah, actually, yeah, what you did was technically wrong.
[75:33.39]You're not asking the right questions is the problem.
[75:35.79]Ooh, what's that one?
[75:42.34]It gives you damage.
[75:44.00]Whatever, guys.
[75:44.74]That's money is power, isn't it?
[75:47.40]I'm right.
[75:48.04]I'm always right.
[75:48.74]Cloth is HP plus damage.
[75:52.80]Oh my god.
[75:53.40]I'm always correct.
[75:55.70]What happened to Boo?
[75:56.40]Should I just leave that thing at this point?
[76:02.96]Take it.
[76:03.36]What the fuck are you doing?
[76:04.80]No, I don't want to... No.
[76:09.22]You got seven cents.
[76:10.24]I don't have enough money.
[76:11.02]That's stupid.
[76:12.08]We're just going.
[76:13.28]Scream at me.
[76:13.72]Scream at me.
[76:14.12]Come on, chat.
[76:14.84]Scream at me.
[76:19.52]This is a dead run anyways because I'm worrying too much about... I had like seven hearts and I was worrying about curse rooms.
[76:26.84]Because the god gamer star is like, you should go in those curse rooms as many as you can.
[76:30.79]You need to do that.
[76:31.61]Because you've got a piece of guppy in there.
[76:34.43]It worked out.
[76:34.99]You don't need guppy.
[76:38.29]Don't touch that.
[76:38.79]You want guppy.
[76:40.55]I need to come back to that room and pick that up.
[76:50.32]Do you want to die, please?
[76:51.20]Just can't get hit by the boss and I'll be set.
[77:09.39]Dude, Gemma.
[77:10.55]Yo.
[77:14.35]That's the monkey paw, right?
[77:15.91]Or the... What is that?
[77:16.75]Left hand or something?
[77:19.83]That gets rid of your left bumper.
[77:24.21]Wait, that's a different soul heart?
[77:27.83]I thought that was like a holy heart where you have to make sure you have it still at the end of the level, or is that a different one?
[77:33.84]Usually holy hearts are half of a heart.
[77:36.86]Oh, so wait.
[77:37.32]That one's a full one.
[77:38.50]Okay.
[77:39.38]So just take it?
[77:41.80]Yeah.
[77:42.64]Okay.
[77:43.39]It regens?
[77:44.15]I thought, yeah, that's weird.
[77:45.23]Okay.
[77:49.46]I hate these things.
[77:59.26]That thing actually is really good.
[78:01.84]Why aren't you using the monkey paw?
[78:05.10]What does the monkey paw even do?
[78:07.72]It gets you guppy.
[78:09.25]It gets me guppy?
[78:10.95]Yeah.
[78:14.11]Okay.
[78:17.07]Okay.
[78:17.83]Let's go get it.
[78:24.32]Can't wait to get Guppy.
[78:27.24]And... They'll die instantly with Guppy.
[78:30.00]And then everyone's gonna revoke my gamer license again.
[78:32.92]Like they did last time.
[78:33.76]This is just a flashback of last time.
[78:38.94]Oh, no.
[78:39.48]No, no, no, no.
[78:40.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[78:42.35]No.
[78:42.53]No what?
[78:49.11]I was listening to chat.
[78:50.33]I didn't even see the item on the ground.
[78:51.99]People were saying that it was the monkey paw.
[78:54.70]And you were saying things.
[78:57.86]I'm not going in that curse room.
[78:59.52]I'm not going in.
[79:03.79]Don't take it?
[79:05.51]Take it.
[79:09.22]He's not trolling, it's all over.
[79:10.68]This is why playing, like, Binding of Isaac is so hard, because there's so many different things.
[79:14.18]Chat, chat, excuse me, just keep, just stay the course.
[79:16.32]Fucking listen to me, man.
[79:17.74]Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna listen to you.
[79:20.50]I will, I will make sure you don't forget the thing to do that you have to do that the chat's freaking out about.
[79:25.88]Okay.
[79:27.50]Okay.
[79:30.10]Let's go.
[79:37.76]I, like, thought I was gonna die right there.
[79:40.36]Jeremy, you're never gonna die as long as you hold me close.
[79:43.96]Where are you?
[79:45.16]Where are the- What's going on?
[79:46.14]Oh, it's nothing.
[79:49.50]What's going on?
[79:50.18]You're inside the room, dude.
[79:50.78]What the fuck are these things?
[79:51.73]What are those things?
[80:02.47]Never seen these guys before.
[80:03.97]God!
[80:05.45]They keep doing this shit?
[80:10.77]Get out of my life.
[80:13.69]Hey, Clive.
[80:17.85]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[80:18.63]It says, never listen to chat ever.
[80:20.31]It's hilarious.
[80:24.58]Sometimes they're right, though.
[80:31.88]Damn.
[80:33.78]Copy.
[80:35.42]Copy.
[80:38.44]Gupy, guppy.
[80:39.44]I did it.
[80:40.50]I did it.
[80:40.90]Did you do it?
[80:41.54]I did it.
[80:41.82]That's guppy, right?
[80:43.10]I turned into guppy now, right?
[80:45.06]The cat head, right?
[80:47.97]What's your favorite type of cat?
[80:50.27]I did it.
[80:50.61]I'm gonna have a guppy.
[80:52.45]Alright, let's do it.
[80:53.55]Get me.
[80:54.65]Okay, okay, okay.
[80:55.55]Here's the other situation.
[80:56.61]Chat, I don't remember what button you have to press, but you hold down one of the bumpers and you drop your trinket.
[81:02.58]Uh-huh.
[81:02.78]I don't remember which one that is, but you should drop the paw now that you got it.
[81:06.68]So, just drop the hand.
[81:09.58]Yeah.
[81:11.53]Is there a secret?
[81:12.47]How do I do that?
[81:12.99]Like, hold R or something?
[81:14.05]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[81:14.61]You have to, like, hold down... Oh, there it is.
[81:16.95]Yeah, I got it.
[81:17.95]Yeah.
[81:20.25]Alright, here we go.
[81:23.79]Guppy's head.
[81:25.91]And now... Middle bumper.
[81:29.08]Wait, what?! !
[81:35.00]Am I guppy right now?
[81:37.52]I thought I had flies everywhere.
[81:40.43]You have to hurt things to get the flies.
[81:43.33]Every time a tear hits... Do I have to keep the guppy's head, or can I replace it now?
[81:48.77]You can keep the head, but you should probably just keep the head.
[81:51.60]The shoop-de-woop thing is pretty terrible.
[81:54.18]What does the actual use do on this thing?
[81:56.98]You gotta use every room, and it gives you three flies.
[81:59.70]Oh.
[82:02.90]Make sure you use it every room.
[82:03.98]Yeah.
[82:09.31]Secrets.
[82:12.87]Was that a skeleton key or something?
[82:14.17]Cool.
[82:14.43]99 keys.
[82:17.77]There's another room over here.
[82:20.98]It's one of these hearts.
[82:23.18]Now, this is the heart that I should leave alone, right?
[82:25.44]Until I beat the... Like, I'm about to kill the boss.
[82:28.96]Or after I kill the boss or something.
[82:35.41]Or should I just pick it up now and say fuck it?
[82:39.27]Just fuck it, who cares?
[82:43.01]You know what I mean?
[82:44.75]No, I shouldn't have done that!
[82:46.22]Shh!
[82:51.40]It's okay, we're okay, we're fine.
[82:52.12]Alright, here we go.
[82:54.36]It's time for Guppy's Big Adventure!
[83:09.39]I don't know where my body is, for God's sakes.
[83:11.11]Dude, when you start up this run, you are a humanoid person.
[83:20.84]Yeah, isn't that funny?
[83:21.44]Should I go in the devil room?
[83:23.06]Or should I just... Am I going up or down?
[83:24.52]Where should I go?
[83:26.88]You're going up.
[83:28.75]The cathedral.
[83:29.55]Ah, the cathedral.
[83:30.33]Right.
[83:30.77]I don't know if the devil deal works in any birth, but... I forget if they change that.
[83:35.33]Go in the devil deal room.
[83:36.73]Just check it real fast.
[83:39.45]No, it's the same one.
[83:41.57]Okay.
[83:42.01]We're going up.
[83:42.67]Oh, yeah, because you already got in there.
[83:43.85]Yeah, going up.
[83:47.17]Spotlight.
[83:50.61]And we get our heart.
[83:52.41]Cathedral.
[83:54.27]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching this run, because we're about to die.
[83:57.42]There we go.
[84:05.18]That was like a magician.
[84:06.14]I don't even know what the fuck that guy did.
[84:14.34]Oh god, where am I even going?
[84:29.38]It's too much!
[84:30.76]It's too much.
[84:31.98]Use the card?
[84:32.56]Good idea!
[84:34.26]Good idea, guys!
[84:40.93]You can use Guppy's head before you enter rooms, by the way.
[84:44.94]Let's go.
[84:53.05]Fuck that guy.
[84:54.49]We gotta go down, right?
[84:58.09]Curse room?
[84:58.73]No.
[85:01.27]I don't care what that even is.
[85:02.25]I'm not gonna risk getting hit.
[85:06.06]What an easier room, thank god.
[85:07.70]We're getting easier rooms.
[85:11.18]Nothing in this one.
[85:24.00]Okay, wish me luck!
[85:56.19]Die!
[85:57.43]Super chest, super chest, super chest, super chest.
[85:59.61]Okay.
[86:01.17]Now... Unit 2321, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[86:05.65]Tuned in to relax with some germish soothing my eardrums, but now I'm stressed out.
[86:11.33]Thanks a lot, dude.
[86:12.79]Does that mean we... Isn't the chest another... Yep.
[86:17.52]Okay.
[86:19.25]You gotta keep going.
[86:20.43]You gotta keep pressing on.
[86:21.73]I'm with you up until the end, man.
[86:23.23]I know, right?
[86:24.15]Dude, we're doing this together.
[86:25.85]The chest.
[86:26.33]Let's open up everything, right?
[86:29.32]And just take fucking everything.
[86:33.76]What are these items?
[86:35.06]I'm gonna give you a second, because I don't know what any of these are.
[86:39.70]Okay, here's what you're gonna do.
[86:44.15]I need you to create a shrine to Brady Tom.
[86:47.33]Brady, that's what I'm talking about.
[86:49.69]Uh, the top left, you're gonna take that shit, that's fucking damage.
[86:52.81]Damage.
[86:53.28]Uh, the bottom right, the bomb.
[86:54.86]Poison bombs, I think?
[86:55.84]You just get more bombs.
[86:56.80]More bombs!
[86:57.32]Lazarus wraps at the bottom left.
[87:01.96]Uh, is that a usable item?
[87:03.60]I don't know.
[87:04.74]Pick it up.
[87:07.33]Eternal life.
[87:08.69]It's just an extra life.
[87:10.67]Okay, yeah, that's what I thought.
[87:12.11]What about the rock?
[87:12.69]The rock bomb?
[87:13.47]I think that might be new.
[87:14.35]Because I don't know what that is.
[87:15.59]But I'm sure it just modifies bombs, so whatever.
[87:18.30]Rock blast plus five bombs.
[87:22.92]Try a bomb.
[87:23.94]Yep.
[87:27.22]Woo!
[87:28.69]That was kind of cool!
[87:35.91]Can those hit me?
[87:36.73]I hope not.
[87:48.92]Mmm, I hate the big rooms.
[87:53.22]Wow!
[87:58.26]I'm unnecessarily freaking out right now.
[88:00.02]Stop freaking out.
[88:00.80]It's easy.
[88:06.32]What the fuck?
[88:09.34]Fucking guillotine.
[88:12.32]Honestly, if you lose this run...
[88:14.57]Your gamer card is being taken away.
[88:16.18]I'm not gonna lose this problem.
[88:17.98]You have so much damage.
[88:19.14]Why would I lose this problem?
[88:21.10]I don't know.
[88:22.18]You could find a way to do it with your seven lives.
[88:24.86]Yeah, I could.
[88:31.10]I wish I could put my fucking head back on really.
[88:50.50]Do this one for Tom Brady.
[88:52.87]That's the tick, right?
[88:53.73]I don't want the tick.
[88:56.73]Take it.
[88:58.25]Isn't that bad?
[88:59.63]There's no reason not to take it.
[89:00.83]It makes you do more damage to bosses.
[89:03.07]It's just you can't remove it.
[89:04.49]You can never take it off.
[89:06.96]Well, you're almost done.
[89:09.20]Actually, there might be an extra area after this in Annie.
[89:11.66]It might be.
[89:12.44]But it might be like a secret way to get to it.
[89:14.44]But I'm pretty sure there is a new area.
[89:21.53]Greed?
[89:22.43]Okay, well, you're meaningless right now.
[89:28.69]Wow, he's got a one tick rate.
[89:35.56]Who does greed?
[89:40.72]War.
[89:47.15]What?
[89:47.89]What?
[89:48.15]I don't believe that for a second.
[89:50.39]I really don't.
[90:04.41]Well, that came in handy.
[90:05.23]I need a heart.
[90:19.78]I want a game kit.
[90:20.66]I want the heart.
[90:22.66]Ooh.
[90:24.72]At least it doesn't matter.
[90:26.32]Come on.
[90:26.72]Health up.
[90:28.37]Oh boy, oh boy.
[90:30.33]Health up.
[90:31.72]Range up and health up again.
[90:33.78]Come on.
[90:34.54]Give me full health.
[90:37.46]No.
[90:39.51]I need health.
[90:41.15]Ayayay.
[90:42.29]Hematososis.
[90:44.23]Hematomesis.
[90:45.27]Doesn't that do something for me?
[90:47.80]Yeah.
[90:48.62]It drops 12 hearts, doesn't it?
[90:50.04]Doesn't it drop a heart?
[90:51.76]Yeah.
[90:52.04]That doesn't fucking matter.
[90:53.30]You're so paranoid.
[90:54.28]You can't have bad pills.
[90:56.12]I know, but I'm saying... I need hearts.
[91:00.11]I need hearts.
[91:01.63]No, you don't.
[91:02.23]The boss is right there.
[91:04.77]And you know what the game kid does?
[91:06.39]Are you a game kid?
[91:12.01]Come on.
[91:12.45]Should I take the game kid?
[91:13.39]Isn't that like the Pac-Man thing?
[91:15.49]Yeah.
[91:16.32]Okay, well, let's kick this guy's ass.
[91:17.94]That's, I mean, like, that's if you're, like, scared.
[91:20.14]Alright, here we go, let's go!
[91:23.65]Die, motherfucker!
[91:37.20]I win!
[91:37.70]I win!
[91:38.16]I win!
[91:45.23]I think it's the extra health that did it.
[91:46.57]It is.
[91:49.75]Can you believe this streamer?
[91:53.00]I would just like to give a shout out to Jeremy.
[91:54.72]Not only did he beat Dark Souls 3.
[91:56.20]That's right.
[91:57.32]On his first run.
[91:59.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:00.82]First run back in, what was that again?
[92:04.68]16 years.
[92:05.42]In 16 fucking years.
[92:10.34]goes back to his old school I think this wins now should I keep the game kid or take the guppy head because I think there's another room what would star do would he keep the game kid for a situation that he doesn't want to die in or would I keep the game kid because I'm Jerma I'm scared and I want to be immune is that it come on no there's another room right
[92:39.94]There's got to be another room.
[92:41.60]They added more stuff.
[92:46.53]Nah.
[92:47.29]No new floor?
[92:49.15]Oh, it's not a new floor.
[92:56.36]An hour and a half.
[92:58.04]A new secret final chapter.
[93:01.02]I don't know how to get there.
[93:03.08]Oh.
[93:04.22]Well.
[93:06.39]Real platinum god, guys.
[93:07.65]Alright, let's, um... There is a new challenge, though.
[93:10.28]Let's see what it is.
[93:14.92]It wasn't an audio challenge.
[93:15.92]Am I stupid?
[93:19.43]Turbo, yeah.
[93:20.45]Turbo.
[93:26.53]I never did this.
[93:27.53]Seller 1.
[93:27.94]Alright.
[93:29.60]Jerma985, I'm going to get out of here.
[93:32.22]Come on.
[93:32.82]You can't get out of here.
[93:33.44]I'm glad I could see you.
[93:34.52]What?
[93:38.52]Everything's like times two speed.
[93:40.18]What does this do?
[93:43.30]Anti-gravity.
[93:45.96]Oh, Lord.
[93:49.88]Oh, and the enemies... Oh, you're just playing Shovel Knight with 120 Hz.
[93:54.35]Yeah.
[93:58.35]I can't do this.
[93:58.99]No, this is going to be a headache.
[94:02.13]You should beat it.
[94:03.41]You should beat it like this.
[94:05.52]I can't.
[94:07.66]What is this guy?
[94:12.60]Just run about... Ow.
[94:19.13]Let's go, go, go, go, go!
[94:20.04]Go, go, we're gonna beat this in ten minutes.
[94:24.38]Five minutes!
[94:24.82]You guys didn't think you were gonna see a speedrun today.
[94:27.40]Yeah, you didn't think you were gonna see this!
[94:40.25]Holy shit!
[94:41.07]Okay, that's kinda good.
[94:42.57]This actually looks really fun.
[94:46.27]It's not.
[94:47.75]It, like, hurts.
[94:50.11]Well, Isaac is so boring and slow and it's such a bad game.
[94:55.10]Why do all these kids like it?
[94:57.44]And this makes it look like... WarioWare Isaac.
[95:03.53]I'm losing track of where I'm going.
[95:12.00]Don't lose this.
[95:22.84]firing squad, these guys.
[95:23.84]Come on.
[95:24.32]I'm going to just have to beat the foot.
[95:34.51]What do you think?
[95:37.51]If it's just mom's foot, then it might be okay.
[95:40.26]But if you have to beat the whole thing like this, I feel like a bad headache.
[95:55.42]Times two speed.
[95:57.06]Dude, I'm leaving.
[95:58.42]You can't leave.
[95:59.64]Why not?
[96:00.42]We'll have the fun and goofy commentary while I play.
[96:03.04]You.
[96:04.44]You.
[96:06.51]That's how it's supposed to work.
[96:15.31]It's too fast, dude.
[96:18.55]It's too much.
[96:19.59]I can't fucking handle it.
[96:21.99]I can't do it.
[96:23.85]Shh.
[96:32.42]I don't know.
[96:32.94]I don't know what any of this shit is.
[96:34.42]Fuck that.
[96:36.61]Get out of here.
[96:38.71]Damage up.
[96:39.21]I'm good.
[96:54.68]Speed, speed, speed.
[96:59.48]This is just coffee mode.
[97:00.74]That's all this is.
[97:02.90]Did you- I'm sorry, I know this is really late, but you took- you didn't take a double deal because you didn't know what it was.
[97:07.30]You're a fucking coward.
[97:08.28]Now I'm definitely leaving.
[97:09.26]Like, I was gonna stay and hang out, but that's like no balls.
[97:13.02]You can't- The fuck are you doing?
[97:15.46]Bye.
[97:16.24]What?
[97:19.71]Fuck you.
[97:21.57]You understand how much stress this is?
[97:23.07]You know how much pressure this is?
[97:25.75]What is that?
[97:26.47]Chewing gum?
[97:31.57]What does this do?
[97:34.70]What?
[97:35.06]What was that?
[97:38.06]What did I just do?
[97:39.80]I don't have it anymore.
[97:45.10]I think I might have done something wrong there.
[97:53.65]Okay.
[97:57.31]It's over.
[98:08.23]It's gonna be over.
[98:08.73]It's gonna be over.
[98:09.23]Just die, die, die, die, die.
[98:12.44]Oh, please.
[98:13.62]Ooh.
[98:15.32]Yes.
[98:19.63]I didn't even go to the item room.
[98:36.32]Come on.
[98:37.14]Seriously.
[98:38.14]Give me a fucking break.
[98:39.18]Give me a break.
[98:44.20]Extra life?
[98:44.82]Sure.
[98:45.00]Hourglass.
[98:56.15]That actually is going to be very good here.
[98:59.73]That's going to be super good.
[99:00.71]I need that other heart.
[99:07.54]Blow this up.
[99:08.00]Just take whatever it is over there.
[99:09.10]Here's the thing.
[99:11.16]I'm going to go back to the regular game.
[99:13.22]And I'm not going to be able to play it.
[99:17.41]I seriously almost just screamed right there.
[99:21.33]God damn it.
[99:26.35]Don't even matter.
[99:27.71]Let's go.
[99:32.12]Set the game to normal.
[99:32.84]Yeah, I'm going to put the game back to normal speed.
[99:35.48]I think I have to beat the clock.
[99:39.13]Yeah, I have to be that clock I could stop go wow that room was horrible Jesus Christ
[100:07.07]I can't.
[100:08.07]I can't.
[100:08.51]No, I can't.
[100:12.92]Jesus!
[100:13.70]It's over.
[100:14.56]No, it's not.
[100:14.86]It's not over.
[100:15.32]I'm good.
[100:16.38]I'm fine.
[100:25.63]Soul generator.
[100:26.11]Hell yeah.
[100:26.33]Hell yeah.
[100:26.65]Hell yeah.
[100:26.97]This is gonna be good.
[100:30.04]No, I gotta beat the clock.
[100:30.80]We gotta go.
[100:47.53]Fucking healthy, you idiots have!
[100:49.04]It wasn't even the right way.
[100:58.00]Oh, yai yai.
[100:58.66]I don't have a- God damn it!
[101:06.25]It's too fa- It's too much.
[101:17.00]I would have been dead like five rooms ago unless I had this.
[101:23.86]Oh, fucking God.
[101:24.94]I can't do it.
[101:25.74]It's over.
[101:26.20]Bye.
[101:26.42]See you later.
[101:28.02]I don't even know where I'm going right now.
[101:35.75]Oh, fuck.
[101:55.54]Help me.
[101:56.20]Boo!
[101:57.96]Boo!
[101:58.32]What do I do?
[102:02.34]What's the other challenge?
[102:08.76]All these are locked.
[102:13.44]Luckiest.
[102:14.78]That was intense, man.
[102:23.47]You can't revoke my gaming license for that.
[102:25.51]That's really hard.
[102:27.25]Come on.
[102:29.72]Alright, I'm going to use one of the new characters.
[102:32.98]You need 12 soul hearts in this guy.
[102:35.68]Bethany and Jacob.
[102:40.54]I have a thousand Eden tokens.
[102:41.94]That's so funny.
[102:45.01]Gets carried and still loses.
[102:46.63]What do you mean gets carried?
[102:49.95]That was hard.
[102:50.87]That was fucking hard.
[102:53.77]How you doing?
[102:54.91]How you doing?
[102:55.61]First try.
[102:59.11]What is this?
[103:05.01]What?
[103:07.89]Okay, hold on.
[103:12.49]What is going on right now?
[103:17.23]I'm just the Pied Piper of shit.
[103:18.89]Are you kidding me?
[103:27.83]Alright, this is easy.
[103:29.13]Ow!
[103:34.51]Get him, my minions!
[103:35.41]My Pikmin!
[103:42.66]They just follow me through every room, too.
[103:43.94]Alright, this one's gonna be fun.
[103:47.83]Let's go, guys!
[103:59.39]Um, well, okay.
[104:02.27]I don't even... I'm so slow.
[104:14.03]That's not fair.
[104:15.35]I'm so slow.
[104:16.19]Go get him.
[104:28.92]You use the space?
[104:29.52]I am.
[104:30.04]I'm using it.
[104:37.18]This one's actually kind of fun.
[104:38.19]You just run around with your little army.
[104:46.75]Although it's going to be hard to see projectiles if they can go through them.
[104:54.60]Something's still alive?
[104:57.02]What is it?
[104:59.98]I can't go over there.
[105:02.00]Here we go.
[105:08.47]Get him.
[105:09.49]Get him.
[105:11.65]Get him.
[105:13.70]Somebody touch him.
[105:16.18]Somebody kill him.
[105:18.52]What were you waiting so long for?
[105:19.92]I think my chat died, by the way.
[105:32.07]Yeah, my chat is dead.
[105:32.95]I can't say anything if you guys are writing.
[105:34.23]Sorry.
[105:34.57]Am I even still alive?
[105:39.43]Maybe.
[105:48.46]Are you a wizard?
[105:49.04]No, I'm not.
[105:49.84]Alright.
[105:50.46]Boss room.
[105:52.66]Duke of Flies.
[105:53.68]Actually, this is going to be great.
[105:54.88]Give me more flies.
[106:04.25]Attack!
[106:14.11]This is more of a pain in the ass than I thought it was gonna be.
[106:16.64]They just stay right next to you.
[106:18.66]Get over there!
[106:19.70]Jump on them!
[106:22.52]Can I, like, direct them?
[106:28.63]I don't think I can.
[106:31.05]Nope.
[106:31.49]They just have a mind of their own.
[106:32.61]Go on.
[106:35.02]Get over there.
[106:36.70]Just corner him.
[106:37.50]Get him in a corner.
[106:38.10]Alright, I think I'm good.
[106:49.69]I'm gonna go play like the regular game because this is gonna take like ages to do anything.
[106:54.73]This is fun though.
[107:03.04]Tears and shot speed up, but that does nothing for me.
[107:05.00]Oh, I'm going to refresh my chat, just to make sure, because I can't see it.
[107:10.39]Still live, right?
[107:11.05]Yeah.
[107:13.85]Uh, what's going on with my chat?
[107:18.69]One second.
[107:22.70]Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.
[107:25.44]Doom, doom.
[107:32.81]There it is.
[107:34.12]Nope.
[107:36.26]Uh-oh.
[107:36.68]twitch.tv is all fucked up.
[107:42.78]Yeah, I can't even.
[107:46.09]Chad is dead, apparently.
[107:50.03]Oh, no.
[107:50.31]Now I can't see what you're all saying.
[107:59.44]Well, whatever.
[108:00.82]I'm just going to go
[108:02.81]I'm gonna go back to the regular game.
[108:05.01]That's something I'll do, like, another time.
[108:06.38]I'm gonna open up... Let's play with... Samson?
[108:20.41]No.
[108:21.75]I'll just roll Eden for fun.
[108:24.49]I'm not gonna do the Lost.
[108:25.87]Hmm...
[108:35.44]Let's do Eden.
[108:36.57]See what we get.
[108:37.45]Get plenty of tokens.
[108:40.79]Before we get started, though, uh, thank you to... Dr. Jensen for the 250 bits.

[109:39.72]Echo Foxtrot for eight months.
[109:41.68]Gatol3, thanks a lot, guys.
[109:46.50]And hopefully twitch.tv can fix itself here.
[109:51.66]I don't think it is.
[109:52.22]I'm going to hop into the Discord and just make sure it's not just me.
[109:57.26]Let's see what any of my mods are saying.
[109:59.02]I mean, like, two.
[110:03.04]So this is actually a dumb setup, but it's okay.
[110:04.86]Let me just see what people are saying.
[110:12.57]Is chat dead?
[110:18.84]Or is it just me?
[110:21.28]No, it is.
[110:21.76]Okay.
[110:23.54]Well, enjoy me while I do this while I don't interact with anybody.
[110:31.19]Maybe it'll fix itself, but thanks a lot for the subs and bits.
[110:33.17]Let's just go.
[110:35.13]This is the horse.
[110:35.91]What else do I have?
[110:37.31]Those aren't that terrible to start.
[110:40.25]Let's just go.
[110:42.60]Fly, that's a good thing.
[110:49.77]You're in such an awkward spot.
[110:52.80]And now you're shooting up spiders.
[110:53.94]Alright.
[111:06.39]That took a lot longer than it should have.
[111:12.21]Yeah, maybe like subs and bits aren't working either.
[111:15.98]Because I haven't seen anything in the last like 10 minutes.
[111:19.03]If anyone has given any like bits or anything.
[111:21.71]Now I'm just talking and just walking into shit.
[111:24.55]You know, can't I just fucking ram into these guys?
[111:26.45]Oh my fucking god, I went the wrong goddamn way.
[111:35.98]I so badly wish I had just a bomb to drop in here.
[111:37.84]This is annoying.
[111:43.40]Whew, in an empty room here, talking in an empty room.
[111:57.63]Eden, ah, what am I doing?
[112:01.89]What am I doing?
[112:05.33]I would restart if I didn't have flight in the very beginning.
[112:08.51]There's no reason to restart.
[112:12.68]Although I do have a thousand tokens.
[112:16.68]Hey, actually, like, I can't see what chat's saying, so, like, this is, like... If you guys are writing, like, failfish and, like, you suck and shit like that, like... Oh, you missed!
[112:24.25]You missed!
[112:25.19]I can't even see it.
[112:27.03]Look at that.
[112:37.04]More of these stupid-ass spiders.
[112:43.52]Wasn't twitch.tv having problems yesterday, too?
[112:47.08]I think they were.
[112:47.62]That works.
[112:52.01]That opens up doors.
[112:55.41]Infestation 2.
[112:57.23]Infestation shot.
[113:01.88]I think that's when I just hit anybody and spawn spiders, right?
[113:08.62]I didn't even sick I was just I I'm like color.
[113:10.76]I'm dead no I Seriously was like just colorblind right there didn't that guy didn't exist Didn't see it Need a heart Make sure I don't miss anything don't go that way Just check and make sure don't miss it Brock I
[113:42.08]Can't blow that up.
[113:44.48]I can't do anything.
[113:48.36]Well.
[113:50.18]Oh, well.
[113:51.97]Time to lose.
[113:52.59]Huh?
[113:54.45]What the hell just happened?
[114:02.71]And it's against the haunt.
[114:03.53]I'm going to get hit.
[114:12.74]This damage is atrocious, by the way.
[114:14.50]I can't even kill these little shits.
[114:22.31]Are you serious?
[114:25.41]Just ram him.
[114:26.69]RAM HIM!
[114:27.01]That one's standing right in front of him.
[114:35.82]That's bad news.
[114:47.11]Please give me a good item if I beat him here.
[114:48.43]Come on.
[115:00.97]Don't get stuck there.
[115:03.17]You'll regret it.
[115:04.57]You'll regret it.
[115:05.13]Okay.
[115:09.37]Give me something good.
[115:10.11]Oh, I don't know what these are.
[115:13.30]I know this box just gives you random items, but what are these two band-aids?
[115:16.58]Hold on.
[115:18.40]I'm going to look it up.
[115:19.08]Is chat back yet?
[115:19.98]No.
[115:20.36]Let me refresh.
[115:21.04]Okay.
[115:30.37]Let's see.
[115:32.25]I know the box just drops stuff, but what do those two band-aids do?
[115:36.90]Wikipedia.
[115:38.66]Alright.
[115:38.96]Old bandage plus one health up and the given heart container is empty.
[115:44.49]I want to do that.
[115:50.37]I know that's not the greatest idea.
[115:52.31]Maybe because I have to get hit once I'm dead, but... You know.
[115:57.64]I do get the extra heart slot.
[115:58.70]And if I'm not terrible, which I am, then I should be fine.
[116:10.14]I can fly.
[116:10.58]What am I doing?
[116:14.92]Come on.
[116:18.03]Come on.
[116:19.55]Hey, look at that heart, cool.
[116:22.17]Woo!
[116:26.27]Rocks, rocks, rocks?
[116:28.54]No rocks.
[116:35.56]Twitch!
[116:45.59]There we go.
[116:46.69]Curse room, but I'll die.
[116:47.99]Like, it'll kill me probably.
[116:51.55]Just kind of felt like doing that.
[116:53.65]Don't ask me why, but I did.
[117:05.08]Great.
[117:05.74]Fuck.
[117:07.84]Easy.
[117:11.22]Okay.
[117:13.29]And what is it?
[117:16.67]Oh, great!
[117:17.63]Thanks!
[117:19.64]All that trouble for no reason.
[117:22.96]Now, don't mind me while I spend the next, like, five minutes killing these enemies, because my damage is so bad.
[117:30.96]Ugh, so bad!
[117:39.13]My damage sucks.
[117:42.31]I'm gonna cry about it some more.
[117:46.41]What the fuck?
[117:47.55]Give me something decent.
[117:49.65]That's decent.
[117:51.59]Decent enough.
[117:53.23]Easy.
[117:53.67]Thank you, spider.
[117:56.61]What?
[117:56.93]Ugh.
[118:14.70]This is a really awkward room.
[118:15.78]Come on.
[118:16.76]Die.
[118:25.86]Get him, Spidey.
[118:27.44]Up that way.
[118:28.10]Top left.
[118:30.01]Good job.
[118:33.65]If I get some decent tears up and, like, damage, this actually will be pretty good.
[118:42.09]That has to happen, though.
[118:47.77]Where am I going?
[118:48.37]Let's go up.
[118:49.53]The item room.
[118:52.37]Rock?
[118:55.49]No rock.
[118:57.95]I guess I... No.
[118:59.31]No curse room.
[118:59.77]We're not doing... We're not going in any curse rooms this whole time.
[119:01.99]The whole game.
[119:02.58]I see a rock.
[119:03.88]I can't blow it up, though.
[119:11.50]Hopefully I get a bomb, and then I can blow the rock up, and then I can go away and get the free shit, you know?
[119:18.53]Get that free shit.
[119:20.87]Hey, you want some free shit?
[119:23.57]I want some free shit.
[119:24.73]You just died.
[119:38.30]Just die.
[119:40.40]You goddamn son of a bitch.
[119:44.26]This is the part of the stream when I just start talking in a southern accent for no reason.
[119:49.70]Pretty cool, huh?
[119:51.40]Watch this one.
[119:58.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[120:05.91]There's two rocks here.
[120:06.99]There's one right there, too.
[120:08.05]Give me some bombs.
[120:10.52]You're killing me, game.
[120:12.06]You're killing me.
[120:15.24]I'll take Brother Bobby.
[120:20.82]Not ideal, but whatever.
[120:21.98]There's bombs.
[120:33.80]Two spades.
[120:34.50]Is that keys or is that bombs?
[120:42.47]I think that's keys.
[120:46.49]Although I might be wrong.
[120:48.25]Boo!
[120:50.05]Boo, send me like a direct message.
[120:58.71]Haven't been destroying all the poo either, have I?
[121:05.65]I don't think I have.
[121:07.16]It's all good.
[121:13.26]Unfortunately, I'm gonna miss out on like... I could go buy a bomb, couldn't I?
[121:17.50]Technically.
[121:21.66]Yeah.
[121:25.31]I'm gonna buy a bomb and I'm gonna blow one of those up.
[121:33.65]Okay.
[121:34.65]Let's go blow one up.
[121:40.17]That one.
[121:43.97]It was worth it.
[121:48.47]That's the one and only chance I get.
[122:10.18]You didn't see shit.
[122:11.32]You didn't see shit.
[122:13.38]You didn't see anything.
[122:14.08]It's okay.
[122:14.38]I still would have had to buy it.
[122:16.88]Still would have had to buy that bomb.
[122:18.59]So, what's that?
[122:20.13]Okay, look at the chat.
[122:20.71]I'm looking at the chat right now.
[122:23.31]I don't see any fail fishes or anything.
[122:24.79]Huh.
[122:25.31]No chat.
[122:26.27]Hmm.
[122:29.54]It doesn't matter.
[122:30.02]It wouldn't have mattered.
[122:31.34]I'm fine.
[122:32.04]Everything's good.
[122:34.60]Don't worry.
[122:38.72]So, what's that?
[122:40.28]Can't look at the chat?
[122:41.80]Can't look at the chat?
[122:44.30]I'm sorry that you guys can't say anything.
[122:47.44]I guess the whole site is fucked up.
[122:50.70]Oh, well.
[122:56.67]So many people right now are probably just like, You fucking idiot.
[123:01.21]You didn't even need to do that.
[123:04.09]I'm gonna get you.
[123:07.09]I'm gonna get you?
[123:07.75]What?
[123:10.83]I'm gonna get you, is what they say.
[123:12.27]I think you just get little Stevie, right?
[123:21.94]After you beat Stevie.
[123:24.16]From my understanding.
[123:28.20]I got hit by something.
[123:29.48]Give me a fucking break.
[123:31.84]Psychic friend.
[123:33.73]Well, now I just need best friends forever.
[123:34.91]And... Wait, what...
[123:40.50]Where'd it go?
[123:40.82]Did I just go in the wrong fucking door?
[123:48.99]Fucking A. What's that looking over there?
[123:51.21]Can't see any fail fishes.
[124:01.01]I blame this on the fact that I can't see any chat.
[124:02.61]I'm just sitting here like by myself.
[124:06.11]That's the excuse this time.
[124:08.95]The excuse you're getting this time is I can't read chat, and we can't hang out.
[124:12.53]And look, that's why I got hit right there, too.
[124:16.52]You guys, like, give me energy to complete things.
[124:19.50]And when I don't have the energy here, how am I supposed to complete them?
[124:22.86]Except I'm, like, busy looking over at the other monitor.
[124:28.46]Did it come back yet?
[124:29.12]Is Twitch, like, fucked up?
[124:30.08]I'm not, like, paying attention completely, 100% complete.
[124:34.22]I am, but I'm not.
[124:35.08]I am, you know, I am, but I wasn't, I wasn't.
[124:37.08]You know, I wasn't, I wasn't.
[124:41.21]Run's not over.
[124:42.15]The run's fine.
[124:51.03]We're fine.
[124:57.54]Die, die, die, die, die, die.
[124:58.54]Whoa!
[124:58.94]Almost got hit.
[125:00.52]Almost was keyword.
[125:07.44]Kill each other, hurry.
[125:09.80]Shoot each other.
[125:11.56]Do they even hurt each other?
[125:13.88]Probably not.
[125:15.74]I'm just a fucking idiot.
[125:17.46]Oh well.
[125:26.03]I kinda freaked out right there, not gonna lie.
[125:29.27]That was a panic.
[125:38.51]Wait a minute, can I go in the curse rooms and not get hurt because I'm flying?
[125:42.81]I think I can.
[125:46.48]I'm pretty sure I can.
[125:47.80]This is why I need Boo.
[125:51.52]I need Star.
[125:52.22]I need you guys to help me here.
[125:54.06]I haven't played this game in a year.
[126:02.36]I can't get my Twitch help.
[126:05.10]My chat helpers.
[126:09.81]That's a new item.
[126:11.37]An Antibirth, I don't know what it is.
[126:14.27]Rotten tomato, delicious.
[126:18.34]What does that do?
[126:20.30]Tears now have a chance to mark enemies.
[126:22.40]Marked enemies will be attacked by other enemies.
[126:28.30]That actually sounds substantially great.
[126:32.25]That sounds amazing.
[126:33.51]Let's try it out.
[126:41.55]Marked enemies.
[126:42.23]Get over there and spider.
[126:52.94]That's all I got to say.
[126:54.08]It's the little red one that comes out every now and then.
[127:00.28]And there's the wiggle worm.
[127:06.99]Wiggle worm can be good if you have bigger tiers, right?
[127:12.59]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[127:13.95]I'm also gonna take this, because I want keys.
[127:16.85]See, he's marked.
[127:26.03]Oh, that is kind of cool.
[127:33.08]Jesus.
[127:34.50]Jesus.
[127:35.48]Don't do it.
[127:48.19]What is that that's also a new item?
[127:51.51]That's the sharp key plus five keys Upon use allows you to consume one key and fire it at an enemy dealing significant damage Keys fired by this item can open doors secret rooms and destroy objects in the room So it makes it you can shoot keys out and they do a bunch of damage Should I try it
[128:14.75]No, I... Let's try it.
[128:17.65]Let's see what it does.
[128:20.71]Let's give it a go.
[128:21.99]Wait, then I lose flight, don't I?
[128:23.31]Because that's an active, isn't it?
[128:34.13]I want to try it, though.
[128:34.84]It's new.
[128:36.71]Try to say fuck it and try it.
[128:38.17]And not even care about this run.
[128:39.93]I mean Twitch is like all fucked up.
[128:42.45]It wouldn't be a big deal.
[128:43.33]What if I just took a funny item and tried to play with it?
[128:48.72]We're doing that.
[128:49.22]I don't care.
[128:52.92]We're gonna just shoot keys at people.
[129:03.05]Just curious if it did it every time.
[129:04.23]Yeah, that's a bad move.
[129:06.42]I shouldn't be doing this, but... I want to use the new items from the new, like, community expansion.
[129:10.92]That's what we're doing.
[129:15.54]So you can shoot keys and they open doors, too?
[129:17.34]This is the first... I mean, the last run when I... Oh, God.
[129:25.65]Hold on.
[129:30.73]Didn't see very many new items in the last run.
[129:34.31]Maybe one or two.
[129:34.87]This is like three in a row now.
[129:36.19]That's cool.
[129:39.08]Let's try it.
[129:39.76]Let's shoot the boss with the key.
[129:45.56]Not this boss.
[129:46.24]This boss is too annoying to hit.
[129:47.76]Actually, you know, I can get him.
[129:59.33]Okay, that's... They just shot each other.
[130:03.58]That was awesome.
[130:11.87]Oh god, these are both, like, hold on.
[130:13.41]I know that one, ah, which one of these is worth taking besides?
[130:18.99]They're both health up.
[130:21.53]That one is plus one health and plus one luck.
[130:24.67]And the other one is damage.
[130:25.89]I'm taking this one.
[130:29.11]I want the damage.
[130:38.01]Okay, I kind of want to get rid of the key thing now.
[130:40.55]Just because, like, it kind of sucks.
[130:45.74]Let's go replace the key.
[130:47.12]Oh, we're going to use the new cool items!
[130:48.80]Except I just tried it and it's not that great.
[130:51.04]Let's go back to being flying and fast.
[131:01.93]Damn it.
[131:05.21]Oh well.
[131:07.23]Let me try to refresh one more time.
[131:09.91]Refresh!
[131:14.74]Flying in fast.
[131:18.06]Still no chat, and still no subs or bits, if anyone has been giving anything.
[131:22.28]So, I apologize for that.
[131:23.70]If anybody is subscribing, if anybody is, like, sending money or anything, then thank you so much.
[131:28.06]But there's no way for me to tell it's happening.
[131:32.86]Goddamn.
[131:35.32]Uh, when we get to the end of this, this run here, I might, uh, call it.
[131:41.68]Whatever happens at the end of this run.
[131:43.88]I already beat the whole thing and went to the chest and everything like that, so I'm not concerned about not, uh... I'm just gonna open up the stream channel.
[131:54.90]Uh, I'm just gonna open up the stream channel in the Discord.
[131:58.40]I can actually, like, see what people are, uh, writing.
[132:02.04]Let's keep going.
[132:08.52]Caves 2, let's go.
[132:18.75]Hi guys.
[132:24.62]Thanks for sticking around.
[132:25.54]A lot of people have left, I'm assuming, because the site's all fucked up.
[132:30.87]For those of you that are still here, thanks for hanging out.
[132:33.46]While Twitch figures out its issues.
[132:37.60]I didn't even know that fucking guy was there.
[132:48.93]FailFish.
[132:49.93]Oh, FailFish.
[132:50.87]Right when he gets in.
[132:51.66]Wait.
[132:52.74]Yeah, I'm good.
[132:54.80]I remembered this time.
[133:00.31]Just a lousy key.
[133:03.23]Ah!
[133:15.23]Now maybe the key thing is not such a bad... Any... secret rocks?
[133:21.84]Probably.
[133:29.60]Don't get sprayed by the fire.
[133:32.92]Okay.
[133:34.64]What the fuck is this thing?
[133:38.09]Anybody have any idea what this is?
[133:41.55]Is this... Is this... Is this charge for money?
[133:46.17]If I have an item that I need to charge.
[133:48.05]I don't have any money.
[133:51.03]I don't think I can do anything with it.
[133:52.75]I'm going to leave it there for now.
[133:55.15]Who knows what the hell that is.
[134:01.92]Okay, I used it.
[134:04.32]It didn't do anything.
[134:05.78]That was great.
[134:08.37]Coin for charge.
[134:09.01]Yeah, that's what I figured.
[134:13.14]Just a blank piece of paper.
[134:15.34]Blank card.
[134:16.04]Card mimic.
[134:21.18]Whatever.
[134:23.24]Who cares?
[134:24.94]Who knows?
[134:25.56]I'm probably going to die right here.
[134:29.28]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[134:34.59]You're not going to die right here.
[134:35.71]You have a decent setup.
[134:38.59]Don't throw it in the trash.
[134:51.87]More keys.
[135:07.79]No, I was going to buy a heart, but screw that.
[135:12.61]Not this early.
[135:13.35]That'd be dumb.
[135:21.26]I just completely fucking missed.
[135:23.66]Whoops.
[135:23.98]I thought I just hit him with a tomato.
[135:30.32]He should have been vulnerable to other people.
[135:33.07]Bullshit.
[135:38.93]Damn it.
[135:39.71]Not good.
[135:41.57]That's a tough combo.
[135:42.63]They fill a whole room.
[135:46.76]Almost fucking died.
[135:47.70]Okay, now I am going to go buy that heart.
[135:51.56]I am gonna go do that.
[135:55.38]What was over here?
[135:56.04]Yeah, I'm buying a heart.
[135:58.56]This is gonna end badly.
[136:02.02]I almost just walked right into that shit.
[136:04.04]Easy, buddy.
[136:07.74]It's Glue Man?
[136:08.52]Where's Glue Man?
[136:09.04]Let's just go.
[136:13.32]Fuck it.
[136:15.58]I'm a tough combo.
[136:25.82]Well Chad eat a bomb That was easy oh That's another friend do I take the friend little Chad I
[136:50.37]Like it's another friend or... More health.
[136:56.80]Alright, Discord.
[136:58.00]Tell me.
[137:00.06]Should I take the right clot?
[137:01.68]The hearts?
[137:03.12]Or should I take the chat to have another little friend?
[137:04.73]What do you guys think?
[137:11.37]What do you guys think?
[137:15.32]Yeah, you cannot see bits chats.
[137:19.13]The chat bits and subs are all down right now.
[137:23.42]Friend, friend, hearts, hearts, friend, friend.
[137:25.66]I'm seeing a lot more friend in here.
[137:29.42]Alright, I'm going with the friend.
[137:33.72]Three friends now.
[137:39.10]Strap hold now.
[137:43.86]I just can't screw it up.
[137:48.96]I'm gonna screw it up, it's over.
[137:50.62]Shh, no.
[137:53.98]Fuck.
[137:54.64]Chad, drop a heart, please.
[138:10.87]Son of a gun.
[138:14.33]Jeez.
[138:16.53]Don't kill me.
[138:19.31]Don't kill me.
[138:20.13]I've got so much to do.
[138:27.74]I'll place your bets if I die right here.
[138:33.84]Close.
[138:35.60]Close!
[138:38.75]Wow!
[138:39.89]I just freaked out.
[138:41.89]Yes!
[138:42.37]Look at that.
[138:42.99]We're saved.
[138:43.95]The run is saved.
[138:44.83]Saved.
[138:45.41]Forever.
[138:46.17]Thank God.
[138:50.34]That was almost a disaster.
[138:58.23]And another hard thing.
[138:59.65]Lord in heaven.
[139:01.01]Ice cream scoop.
[139:02.57]Plop.
[139:06.37]What is that?
[139:08.43]Time to look it up.
[139:15.76]I don't see it anywhere.
[139:17.26]I don't think maybe it's another new item.
[139:18.44]Is it old?
[139:23.46]Let's have it scoop.
[139:25.61]Oh, it is new.
[139:27.23]When used, this item spawns a peeper familiar for the current room, which deals contact damage to enemies and leaves a red creep in its path.
[139:36.93]That's actually pretty cool.
[139:37.73]That's a new Antibirth item.
[139:41.42]Is it... No, we're going to try it.
[139:43.90]We're going to use it because it's a new item.
[139:48.48]And then if it's bad, we're going to immediately turn around and replace it with a thing that's good.
[139:54.30]Just see what it does.
[139:58.62]Didn't that already exist in the game?
[140:02.94]I thought that was Chad that got in the way there.
[140:07.00]I feel like that already was an item.
[140:09.98]You're really going to do this to me?
[140:11.10]Seriously?
[140:22.11]50 bits.
[140:22.77]50 bits.
[140:23.15]I can't even see it.
[140:31.00]Pony's not that good besides the passive flying.
[140:32.80]Yeah, that's true, but... Passive flying is just fantastic.
[140:36.88]You can just save yourself so many ways.
[140:40.42]Plus the speed, too.
[140:41.20]It's a little faster.
[140:41.88]I'm gonna save it for the boss.
[140:55.05]It's probably the boss that's probably right over here.
[141:02.59]I've already been to the item room, yo.
[141:09.45]There's the boss!
[141:11.45]I didn't want to get hit by the thing on the bottom and it freaked me out.
[141:23.00]Paralysis.
[141:28.39]The pile.
[141:35.66]Jesus, man.
[141:36.42]I think this is a new boss.
[141:45.87]Wow.
[142:03.01]Oh fuck, he just- AHHHHH!
[142:05.99]It's over.
[142:14.09]Night night, that's it.
[142:15.64]Fuck.
[142:19.36]Never seen this motherfucker before and now that's how you lose.
[142:25.08]He like, spawns right on top of you, that sucks.
[142:29.36]FailFish, FailFish, FailFish.
[142:33.50]Yeah, I think... Torch is all fucked up.
[142:36.46]I think I might take off.
[142:38.40]We'll do one more.
[142:42.22]We'll do a challenge.
[142:43.18]No, what do I do here?
[142:44.32]Let's see.
[142:50.30]Try to refresh again, see if anything happens.
[142:58.92]Um, let's just go with the lost.
[143:01.65]I'm just going to go with the lost and see what happens.
[143:06.23]Just straight up lost run.
[143:08.21]Whatever happens, happens, and that's it.
[143:24.07]Can't you reroll items?
[143:36.51]Well, thanks for coming.
[143:38.37]Thanks for coming out, guys.
[143:43.45]That was fun.
[143:47.60]That was, uh... Alright, there's the last run.
[143:51.16]No, we did one more.
[143:51.96]One more.
[143:52.18]That was fucking stupid.
[143:54.00]One more.
[144:04.46]What does this item do again?
[144:06.10]I've never done a loss run.
[144:11.18]After 16 more years, maybe I'll come.
[144:12.78]No, I might play this again.
[144:14.96]Tomorrow's the magician stream, though.
[144:17.22]We're going to Twitch IRL.
[144:17.98]We're going to do a fucking magic show.
[144:20.83]It's going to be fucking wild.
[144:45.05]Yeah, he's done.
[144:49.83]Magic spoon doesn't really help me that much right now.
[144:52.45]Yeah, it's gonna be a full-on, like, magic show.
[145:00.48]It's going to be such a piece of shit.
[145:02.94]Ah!
[145:09.84]Jeez, did you see how fast that was?
[145:11.59]I'm just, like, glued to my body in one second.
[145:21.71]And before I get a Mega Satan kill with a Lost.
[145:25.83]Um.
[145:27.75]I would probably more reliably get struck by lightning five times in the same day.
[145:33.56]Than beat Mega Satan with a Lost.
[145:37.14]Same.
[145:37.48]In the exact same day.
[145:39.48]I walk outside.
[145:41.14]Oh, wow.
[145:41.50]It's raining out today.
[145:43.46]Crack!
[145:44.08]And I get struck.
[145:46.04]And then the fucking hospital comes.
[145:48.35]I'm lying on the ground like charred up and shit like that.
[145:50.65]Whee!
[145:52.46]They put me on top of the gurney.
[145:54.48]They, like, put the oxygen on my fish.
[145:57.64]And then, crack again, it hits me on the fucking gurney.
[146:00.10]I fly off the gurney down a hill.
[146:02.68]The bottom of the hill, I go into a lake.
[146:04.82]Lightning strikes again into the lake.
[146:08.20]That's three.
[146:09.68]Finally, they scoop me out.
[146:12.46]And at this point, I'm not even, like, a person anymore, you know what I mean?
[146:17.78]They get me, scoop me up, put me in the fucking gurney again, get me to the hospital.
[146:23.28]I'm in the shower, in the hospital, some dude's like, just like, dragging like the hose over my body, like, just like, oh jeez, this guy's fucked up!
[146:32.93]Lightning strikes through the fucking window, hits me right in the mouth.
[146:35.89]That guy's just like, what's happening, this guy must be possessed by Satan!
[146:38.81]He runs out of the room, he leaves.
[146:44.85]That would happen before I beat the game at the Lost.
[146:56.66]He's officially lost it.
[147:00.07]I'm just, like, shooting his little birds.
[147:01.55]What am I doing?
[147:02.11]I need to be shooting him.
[147:11.78]Get away from me.
[147:14.10]Alright, now I can re-roll items, right?
[147:16.36]What?! !
[147:21.69]What the fuck?
[147:22.77]What am I re-rolling?
[147:23.85]My whole outfit?
[147:26.01]I don't even know what that does.
[147:26.81]I should have looked at fucking Discord.
[147:28.05]I don't... Whatever.
[147:32.13]It's not like I'm going to do anything with this run anyways.
[147:45.08]Roll it every time.
[147:45.84]It just re-rolls your whole entire...
[148:01.92]Oh, man.
[148:03.24]Rerolls all items.
[148:04.12]Yeah, I know now.
[148:05.64]I know now.
[148:18.03]The Emperor, challenge me!
[148:19.41]What does that do?
[148:20.47]What is she... What did my little... This is a new buddy?
[148:28.50]Look at this guy.
[148:28.96]He just sprouts out.
[148:34.00]How do I get him to shoot like that?
[148:40.13]Reroll the stream.
[148:43.43]Tell Twitch to reroll.
[148:53.12]Twitch, why are you so broken?
[148:54.52]I've rerolled Twitch.
[149:02.08]It's too late.
[149:07.34]Jerry.
[149:07.74]Alright, this is how we're gonna end the stream.
[149:13.48]I'm not allowed to stop moving.
[149:16.56]If I stop moving, the stream turns off.
[149:18.56]Okay?
[149:20.76]If my character stops fucking moving for a quarter of a second, the stream turns off.
[149:24.81]You got it?
[149:26.97]So let me just say thank you all for coming.
[149:29.41]Tomorrow's the magic show.
[149:30.39]Hopefully Twitch is fixed by then.
[149:32.03]This is unfortunate.
[149:34.61]Here we go.
[149:36.43]Don't stop moving until the fucking stream turns off.
[149:52.92]No, don't stop moving.
[149:59.38]Again!
[149:59.58]That one didn't count.
[150:11.74]I don't want to turn the stream off yet, hold on!
[150:13.20]Alright, goodbye, that's it, that's it.
[150:27.23]Tom, bye.
[150:28.37]Bye, goodbye.
[150:29.85]See you later.
[150:33.15]I can't.
[150:34.73]I don't know, Twitch just fucking shit the bed tonight for some reason.
[150:39.12]Sorry for, like, the less than, like, three-hour stream tonight.
[150:43.56]But... I'd like to see what people are writing and... Discord is cool too, but... You know.
[150:51.48]If Twitch is just all fucked up, then I'd rather stream tomorrow.
[150:56.81]Hey, but on a lighter note, I did beat the whole game.
[150:59.99]I got through the whole thing.
[151:02.21]And if you're curious, yes, by the way, this is Antibirth.
[151:06.01]This was not the new official expansion to the game that came out like a couple days ago.
[151:13.31]This was Antibirth.
[151:15.73]It's a fully community-made mod.
[151:17.53]And it adds a bunch of stuff to Rebirth, not to Afterbirth.
[151:24.92]And you can just go get it if you have Rebirth.
[151:28.78]It seems like it's pretty cool.
[151:31.12]They have some new secret stuff in it that I obviously have not found.
[151:35.37]But, you know.
[151:38.27]But tomorrow, I'll see you guys for the Magician stream.
[151:42.51]We're going to be on Twitch IRL tomorrow.
[151:45.50]Should be interesting, I guess.
[151:47.98]To say the least.
[151:51.32]7pm tomorrow night.
[151:54.37]Man, Twitch, man.
[151:55.11]What is going on with twitch.tv?
[151:57.47]It's been like an hour since it went down, huh?
[152:02.57]That's kind of dumb.
[152:08.32]Well, that's unfortunate, but, you know, shit happens.
[152:10.52]Good night, guys.
[152:11.94]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[152:12.88]7 p.m.
[152:14.14]Eastern.
[152:15.16]Have a good rest of your night, and goodbye.
[152:23.02]Thank you.
