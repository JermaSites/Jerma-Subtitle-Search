[00:26.21]What are these tags?
[00:27.27]What?
[00:28.85]What tags?
[00:32.17]Where do you see tags?
[00:38.72]English tournament arc.
[00:41.36]Dislikes goat cheese.
[00:42.90]The sus guy.
[00:51.26]Have I ever had a tag on this stream besides English?
[01:02.21]I hate that the sus guy is on here because I feel like people really probably type that in.
[01:08.81]And I don't want him finding me like that.
[01:13.11]These were added last stream.
[01:14.49]That's funny.
[01:19.34]We should change it to not the sus guy.
[01:23.13]Not the sus guy.
[01:24.35]Stop asking.
[01:26.13]So people feel like, wait, he probably gets this a lot.
[01:28.81]This must be really annoying for him.
[01:31.55]Probably gets that a lot.
[01:34.63]Anyways, hi.
[01:36.29]How are you?
[01:36.95]Good to see you.
[01:39.74]Gonna be playing a video game today.
[01:41.58]I don't know why I think that's... I don't know.
[01:44.82]I don't know what's wrong with me lately.
[01:47.38]Gonna be playing Disc Room today.
[01:50.42]It's a fun game.
[01:55.16]Somebody said, hey, you probably found this because it was on Game Pass.
[01:58.16]Yes, that is exactly where I found it.
[02:01.21]I played it on Game Pass for like five minutes and said, this seems like it's something I would want to play and stream and have fun and just hang out.
[02:07.73]That's what we're going to do.
[02:10.11]Also, I want to talk about something really quickly.
[02:13.19]Very exciting news.
[02:15.33]I'm incredibly excited.
[02:16.43]I will wait because I feel like a lot of you probably know what I'm going to talk about already.
[02:22.21]We'll see.
[02:26.72]We'll give it a few minutes.
[02:28.70]I want people to know this.
[02:32.02]I have to tweet still, so give me one second.
[02:34.36]I'll be right back.
[03:03.16]All right.
[03:03.96]You guys ready?
[03:04.34]I think we... Eh, maybe another minute or so.
[03:08.08]I'll talk about it a few more times over the stream.
[03:09.60]It's not like I'm not going to say it ever again.
[03:13.28]This coming week, you will be able to see me on Ranboo's Generation Loss streams.
[03:27.65]I'm going to be playing a pretty major part
[03:34.35]I have an accent.
[03:43.42]But yeah, I'm really excited for it.
[03:45.48]It's been something that's been in the works for a very long time.
[03:50.12]I cannot wait to see the whole thing play out because it is a three-day event.
[03:57.41]May 24th, May 26th, and May 28th.
[04:03.87]6 p.m.
[04:04.81]Eastern time.
[04:06.77]I'm gonna be in it.
[04:10.45]You'll see.
[04:11.01]I don't want to give anything away, but you'll see.
[04:17.96]Can you teach us how to beatbox?
[04:22.64]Yeah, sure.
[04:23.56]First you go like this.
[04:25.00]Then you go like this.
[04:25.53]It's fucking easy.
[04:33.96]When are you going to play Tears of the Kingdom?
[04:35.48]Never.
[04:36.78]Let's just get that out of the way.
[04:38.96]I want to say that because then if I ever do play it, you'll be surprised.
[04:42.00]But if I don't ever play it, then I already told you I wasn't.
[04:44.80]So let's just say that.
[04:51.29]Because then you're not expecting it, but who knows?
[04:58.05]Yeah, a ton of time, a ton of effort has gone into this.
[05:01.25]Uh...
[05:02.72]I don't want to talk too much about it because it's a very, very interesting, very intricate project.
[05:08.44]Just know, I will be participating.
[05:13.34]I cannot wait.
[05:13.84]It's going to be fun.
[05:17.31]We'll probably have the mods put up a sus for it.
[05:25.09]Don't make promises you can't keep.
[05:26.71]Oh, I absolutely can make the promise that I'm not going to play Tears of the Kingdom.
[05:31.90]I can promise you that, right?
[05:33.12]But like, if it happens, then whoa.
[05:36.08]What?
[05:36.86]It's Tears of the Kingdom.
[05:37.84]He's here.
[05:38.32]Then I'll do a huge, elaborate, annoying intro.
[05:45.10]Where I dress as Link.
[05:46.70]And it's a full cam.
[05:47.80]And it's like... I play the song and it's like, oh my god, he's gonna play it.
[05:55.53]We'll make a whole thing out of it.
[06:09.03]And I'll bring out the ocarina.
[06:12.91]And I'll learn a bunch of songs for the ocarina.
[06:17.82]Dude, do you hate this game?
[06:20.06]No.
[06:21.14]Why?
[06:21.46]I'm not mocking it.
[06:22.72]I'm not mocking.
[06:23.76]What are you talking about?
[06:25.04]No, I don't.
[06:26.52]What?
[06:30.16]Am I mocking?
[06:30.89]No, I'm not mocking.
[06:32.01]This is not mocking.
[06:32.93]This is just fucking around.
[06:34.97]I'm not mocking.
[06:39.61]Dude, this dude hates Zelda.
[06:41.05]No, I don't.
[06:41.95]I'm not mocking.
[06:49.93]The Ocarina is pretty easy to learn.
[06:56.93]Can you stop stalling and just survive the discs already?
[07:01.11]Yeah, I get a few minutes.
[07:03.41]This is me time right now.
[07:05.01]I said this last stream too.
[07:06.13]This is me time.
[07:12.66]my intros the first 10 to 15 minutes of every stream is me time this is me this is for me but interrupting turn your cam on and do the rump shake that's like kind of funny but no not today
[07:49.37]Just start twerking.
[07:50.43]Not today.
[07:50.93]I don't know.
[07:52.15]Who knows?
[07:54.71]Maybe one day I'll do a rump shake.
[07:56.65]Just like Tears of the Kingdom.
[07:59.04]I'm not planning on it.
[08:00.20]I don't have a plan to play Tears of the Kingdom.
[08:03.64]But you might get a rump shake one day.
[08:05.26]You never know.
[08:11.76]Please don't don't don't do it.
[08:13.36]I don't even know what that means.
[08:23.24]Does that mean what I think it does?
[08:25.57]Like, just... I'm just gonna shake my ass.
[08:29.15]Is that what it is?
[08:30.21]That's what it is, right?
[08:31.43]It's just... I'm gonna shake my butt.
[08:34.83]That's it.
[08:36.16]Is there anything else to that?
[08:37.56]Or is there more to it?
[08:40.60]Is it something else?
[08:48.93]What else would it mean?
[08:50.13]I don't know.
[08:53.64]have no idea stop mocking rump shake oh okay here we go all right here we go all right let's play this game I I am to the brim of excitement there's things there's so many things I just want to scream it at you but we'll wait we'll wait we'll wait we'll wait we're gonna wait we have to wait
[09:24.51]But yeah.
[09:26.66]Keep an eye on the sus.
[09:28.94]Keep an eye on... What?
[09:32.82]Let's do the roar.
[09:34.40]This is the end of the stream.
[09:37.94]I just turned it on.
[09:38.78]This is me time.
[09:48.05]Okay.
[09:48.73]Let's go.
[09:51.05]I'm turning it on.
[09:53.51]There it is.
[09:53.87]All right, this is Disc Room.
[09:57.23]And yeah, I did get this on Game Pass.
[09:59.53]I mean, it seems like it's going to be really fun.
[10:05.43]This is a game about concentration.
[10:06.92]It's a game about being good at dodging.
[10:11.10]It's one of the only things I can do.
[10:17.24]In 2092, a giant disk is discovered in orbit of Jupiter.
[10:21.56]A crew of international scientists is sent to investigate.
[10:25.50]Oh, cartoon!
[10:26.04]Okay.
[10:34.93]Left stick is move.
[10:38.75]Mm-hmm.
[10:42.11]This is going to be fun.
[10:44.96]You just have to live.
[10:45.94]That's it.
[10:47.80]The only thing you do.
[10:51.08]Game about precision.
[10:59.13]It's the sans fight.
[11:04.51]I guess it kind of is.
[11:05.55]It is kind of the same undertale concept, isn't it?
[11:08.92]It kind of feels like that.
[11:12.26]I'm doing pretty damn good already.
[11:13.82]This is the first room.
[11:15.46]You would have died in five seconds.
[11:16.94]That's alright.
[11:24.21]That's alright.
[11:27.97]Alright, so survive five seconds.
[11:29.47]I did that.
[11:30.15]Die from four different discs.
[11:31.81]I can go left or I can stay over here.
[11:34.87]How do I get the... It doesn't usually... Hold on, let me see.
[11:40.74]How do I start in here again?
[11:45.44]Oh, I think I have to do tutorial stuff.
[11:47.50]It's like asteroids.
[11:48.80]Alright, survive 10 seconds.
[11:50.08]That's all I have to do.
[11:51.98]I think it usually shows the developer time.
[11:53.88]The person that made the game.
[11:54.90]Okay, I was looking at chat.
[11:57.72]Shut up.
[12:07.52]4 seconds?
[12:08.06]Yeah, I got it.
[12:09.48]I already did it.
[12:10.50]I beat it already.
[12:11.96]In fact, I should just hurry up and get to the next room because...
[12:16.12]This guy sucks at this.
[12:17.30]I just did it.
[12:18.20]I'm over time right now.
[12:27.67]Opportunity right here.
[12:28.81]One, two.
[12:30.51]Oh, sorry.
[12:33.51]New best time.
[12:35.01]How does it?
[12:35.31]I think it's supposed to show the dev time.
[12:38.67]How come I can't see that?
[12:39.39]Hold on a second.
[12:41.75]Let me restart this.
[12:45.23]How do I show that?
[12:53.10]Yeah, dev team time.
[12:54.22]It says it's on.
[12:57.10]How come I can't see it?
[12:57.76]Oh, whoops.
[13:02.54]Yeah, see, ready?
[13:03.02]Look.
[13:04.54]Uh, game.
[13:05.60]See, dev team time's on.
[13:07.46]It should be on.
[13:11.81]How come I can't do it?
[13:20.32]The devs never beat this.
[13:23.40]It's not in the tutorial.
[13:24.50]Oh, okay.
[13:25.50]All right, so I already did this one.
[13:30.66]We can take a look at this.
[13:33.06]So this is the game.
[13:33.82]This is the whole game.
[13:35.07]So kind of like the rooms are connected.
[13:37.33]That's pretty cool.
[13:39.07]So we can go up.
[13:40.17]We're going to go up.
[13:40.59]All right, die from four disc types and survive 10 seconds.
[13:45.01]Easy.
[13:45.21]Let's go.
[13:51.48]That was just a practice one.
[13:53.06]See, I didn't even get that move.
[13:54.30]That's why I couldn't do it.
[13:55.40]Alright, hold A to dash through discs.
[14:04.02]Here we go.
[14:05.78]See?
[14:06.99]You give me one button that's a dash and an analog stick, I'm gonna beat every single fucking record in this entire game.
[14:16.79]Is this Omega Gaming Weekend?
[14:18.37]No.
[14:19.59]In fact, this is Omega Short Weekend.
[14:23.12]This is Exceptionally Small Weekend.
[14:30.96]That's alright.
[14:31.54]I'll take it.
[14:34.10]I'll take it.
[14:35.96]Where should I go from here?
[14:36.52]I'm gonna go up.
[14:43.06]Dude, you suck.
[14:44.80]I'm beating every level!
[14:47.21]I'm completing every level, man.
[14:48.75]That's alright.
[14:56.95]I didn't do it.
[15:01.85]Come on, Gwen.
[15:05.68]Come on, man.
[15:11.80]Somebody said, chill, please.
[15:13.48]Are you talking to me or are you talking to the chat?
[15:15.10]I don't know who you're talking to.
[15:18.65]Here we go.
[15:23.11]Oh, I want to talk about this.
[15:24.83]This is really important.
[15:25.65]This is food related, so I know everyone's going to be really excited to hear that.
[15:30.44]I know at least 10 people in the chat heard it was food related, so they just, yes, let's go.
[15:35.50]Okay.
[15:38.00]Let me ask a question.
[15:39.00]I don't want to be rude.
[15:39.96]I'm going to try not to be.
[15:44.38]Can I go up?
[15:45.10]Oh, no, this is a dead end.
[15:47.12]Oh, there is no complete this one.
[15:48.52]All right.
[15:50.02]All right, so here's what I want to talk about.
[15:53.07]I don't want to be disrespectful and I want to be mean about this, but does anyone, has anybody in this chat and of all the 13 plus thousand people that are here right now, 13,000 of you, have you ever, ever bought heavy pulp orange juice?
[16:11.82]Any of you, a single person in the whole chat,
[16:18.89]Because honestly, I think that's like my first test to see if you're a psycho.
[16:24.17]If you drink heavy pulp orange juice.
[16:26.29]Is that weird to say that?
[16:29.12]I'm not talking about medium pulp.
[16:30.42]I'm talking heavy pulp.
[16:32.80]Heavy pulp.
[16:37.34]One of the mods?
[16:37.96]Wait.
[16:38.62]VR Josh.
[16:39.22]What the fuck, dude?
[16:41.49]I don't... Look, I don't mind pulp.
[16:44.22]Light pulp is good, medium pulp, but at some point, I feel like I'm drinking wet wood shavings in my orange juice.
[16:50.86]I feel like I'm drinking bugs.
[16:53.90]Heavy pulp is ridiculous.
[16:57.00]It's sludge.
[16:58.58]It's not even orange juice.
[17:01.20]I like pulp.
[17:01.92]Pulp is fine, but too much of too much is too much.
[17:08.36]Heavy pulp, it gets stuck in your teeth and shit.
[17:17.95]And a smoothie.
[17:19.43]All right.
[17:21.13]Yep.
[17:21.73]Okay.
[17:25.36]All right.
[17:25.88]I want to say I'm not seeing the dev times.
[17:27.16]I might have to restart.
[17:29.64]That makes sense to me.
[17:31.04]I get it.
[17:32.34]All right.
[17:32.76]10 seconds.
[17:33.02]Survive zero seconds or less.
[17:35.90]Okay.
[17:36.04]So survive 10.
[17:41.72]I could see a smoothie because you want some of the actual orange in it.
[17:45.83]I get that.
[17:48.97]But anytime I've ever seen heavy pulp get poured, it reminds me of sour milk where you pour it and it's like... You know what I'm talking about.
[17:59.30]It's that like... Fucking gross.
[18:02.84]All right.
[18:11.77]Survive zero seconds or less.
[18:15.95]Did I do it?
[18:19.59]How do you... How do I die in zero seconds?
[18:24.21]It takes a second for it to spawn.
[18:28.53]Did I get... I got it right there.
[18:29.65]Zero, right?
[18:36.58]How do you... How do I die instantly?
[18:43.62]Zero seconds or less.
[18:48.48]Hey, asshole, I'm drinking milk right now.
[18:50.30]Don't ruin it.
[18:56.19]I just imagined you with a 24-ounce glass of milk.
[18:59.53]0.007.
[19:06.19]I don't think this is possible.
[19:09.78]Die from 15 disc types.
[19:15.34]All right, well, this one, this one.
[19:16.30]There's a different one here.
[19:19.98]Yep.
[19:22.40]Any more in here?
[19:30.96]That count?
[19:31.58]Yep.
[19:31.88]That one counts.
[19:34.36]I gotta go left.
[19:35.95]Defeat the gatekeeper.
[19:39.07]In 10 seconds?
[19:43.55]How do I do it?
[19:44.27]Can I hit him?
[19:45.19]Oh, okay.
[19:45.63]I get it.
[19:54.63]This game's gonna get... Ooh.
[19:56.23]When's the dog food tier list?
[20:01.32]What is the tier list that I actually wanted to do?
[20:02.72]I forgot to bring it up.
[20:04.58]What is the tier list I want to do?
[20:07.88]What was it?
[20:11.55]Shit.
[20:16.59]Oh my god.
[20:17.27]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[20:18.47]What was it?
[20:19.97]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[20:21.73]I never talked about it.
[20:24.67]shit this is why I write everything down I just I didn't write this one down it'll come to me in a minute oh what oh right I wanted to because I saw the the mk1 trailer which was fucking ridiculous by the way
[20:53.69]Uh, I wanted to do a rate.
[20:55.85]Put every, like, uh, tier list for all the Mortal Kombat characters ever.
[21:05.77]That would be kind of fun.
[21:08.83]Do a Mortal Kombat character tier list.
[21:14.07]Do it now?
[21:14.95]No, I mean like in, like, I don't know, like 6 to 12 months.
[21:19.71]What does this do?
[21:23.93]I still can't see the... Time played total deaths.
[21:29.37]Oh, it's keeping track of all this.
[21:33.95]It'll be in a year.
[21:34.81]Oh, that's all right.
[21:38.11]All right, so I want to go up.
[21:43.13]It's keeping track of my total play time.
[21:44.77]Do it right now, you weirdo.
[21:47.47]No, in like six or seven years or something.
[22:03.52]I have to last wait.
[22:05.02]Why is that not counting anymore?
[22:07.72]Oh, you have to stand in the middle.
[22:17.13]I think I could do at least 30 seconds here.
[22:26.09]What do you mean six to seven years?
[22:27.33]You're not even going to be streaming then.
[22:28.77]I'm talking about on Mars.
[22:35.96]We're good I'm still here.
[22:47.22]Oh that had to have been pretty good That had to have been pretty good
[23:04.49]Don't I have to die for him?
[23:05.37]Yeah.
[23:06.81]I have to be killed by a few different discs, right?
[23:08.97]15.
[23:09.21]I haven't been killed by this one.
[23:13.69]That opens one of the other doors.
[23:16.91]Get over there.
[23:20.59]Yup.
[23:22.74]Oh, you have to pick one.
[23:30.16]I'll try slow.
[23:32.88]Best time, 30 seconds.
[23:33.94]I can do better than that.
[23:37.90]That lasts a long time.
[23:38.94]Oh, does it recharge?
[23:41.31]I think it does.
[23:41.87]This is way better than Dash.
[23:46.13]Maybe not.
[23:48.03]Oh, hold on.
[23:48.85]I can do better than that.
[23:52.15]What's this game?
[23:52.55]This game is called Disc Room.
[23:55.51]And you can get it right now.
[24:02.25]You know.
[24:14.74]Sound is good.
[24:16.33]No, it is.
[24:16.75]It sounds great.
[24:20.23]What was my record on this?
[24:21.15]30 seconds.
[24:28.59]Oh, shit.
[24:29.21]I can do better than that.
[24:36.49]I have to beat the record here.
[24:45.00]Die to the golden disc?
[24:46.52]That's actually true.
[24:49.92]That's really true.
[24:53.70]Are you ever going to do a beer drinking stream?
[24:57.74]No.
[25:03.14]Alright, I did it.
[25:05.50]I need to go to undiscovered disc.
[25:11.12]Survived 20 seconds.
[25:12.93]Oh shit.
[25:13.43]I got to do that down here.
[25:14.27]Let's go.
[25:21.03]But you want me to like rate beers?
[25:22.95]I mean, I could do that.
[25:23.85]I could.
[25:24.53]Do you want me to do a beer drinking tier list?
[25:26.51]Like where they belong?
[25:35.54]Okay.
[25:35.82]I don't know.
[25:37.62]I'll figure it out.
[25:38.26]I'll set it up.
[25:39.12]I'll figure that out.
[25:40.48]God damn it.
[25:46.55]They're all going to be put in F. That's not necessarily true.
[25:53.46]So I have to survive 20 seconds.
[25:57.28]There's probably another tier for a minute too.
[26:00.62]Not just American beers.
[26:02.08]No, I know.
[26:04.69]I'm thinking maybe the top, the most popular three or four per country.
[26:11.17]That's very doable considering that's probably four or 5,000 different beers.
[26:17.65]Uh, sure.
[26:19.69]I got it.
[26:22.09]All right.
[26:22.29]I got to go right and up because this one is 20 seconds.
[26:26.32]Armored Gatekeeper.
[26:27.96]Best time, 10 seconds.
[26:30.12]So... How do I do 20 seconds here?
[26:34.36]Is that possible?
[26:40.62]Survived 20 seconds.
[26:42.56]Undiscovered disc.
[26:46.76]How do I do this?
[26:48.28]I have to get 20 orbs.
[26:50.28]Oh.
[26:50.84]I thought he explodes after 10.
[26:58.42]Irma thinks there are like 20 countries.
[27:02.36]No, I just said that was thousands of beers.
[27:04.56]Every country has its own beer.
[27:10.62]Every country has its own beer that it makes.
[27:12.90]Everybody makes a beer.
[27:14.54]Every country.
[27:15.08]I'm telling you, every... I got it.
[27:31.32]If, okay, if you name a country and then go to Google and type in, uh, what is this country's beer?
[27:39.78]It's going to give you a like, oh, it's a 20% hops.
[27:42.92]It's a flavored with pineapple extract.
[27:45.60]I don't know.
[27:45.94]It's going to be something.
[27:57.19]All right.
[27:57.45]Well, we can't.
[27:59.39]Let's just say most people.
[28:13.31]Just say most countries.
[28:14.39]That's, I mean, come on.
[28:15.89]You can't take literally.
[28:17.47]I mean, like, I don't ever speak in literal terms.
[28:21.89]I'm speaking in, like, mostly terms.
[28:29.19]Like, every country's got a beer.
[28:31.07]Oh, yeah.
[28:31.37]Well, oh, what about this country?
[28:32.54]This country doesn't have a beer.
[28:34.42]Yeah, all right.
[28:34.94]Well, maybe they do.
[28:35.60]Maybe they don't.
[28:36.20]I don't know.
[28:36.60]Well, don't say that.
[28:39.38]Well, I don't know.
[28:40.76]Literal Andy?
[28:49.23]You said every I yeah, but like I'm sure there probably is something.
[28:56.14]Name me a country right now.
[28:57.78]Just I'm going to OK, let's do a random country.
[29:01.72]OK, what is?
[29:03.78]Spain, Spain's beer.
[29:14.76]Spanish beer.
[29:16.80]Oh, interesting.
[29:18.12]What's Spain's most popular beer?
[29:21.54]It is called a San Miguel.
[29:24.93]A San Miguel Classica.
[29:28.11]Is the most traditionally and best known among the Spanish population.
[29:36.24]Would you look at that?
[29:38.62]What about Brazil?
[29:40.10]Brazil's beer.
[29:46.58]Here we go.
[29:47.24]What's the most popular beer in Brazil?
[29:50.72]Skol?
[29:52.48]Brahma?
[29:54.14]Antarctica?
[29:57.47]Nova Shin?
[29:59.57]Huh?
[30:02.53]These are Brazilian beers.
[30:08.45]Come on.
[30:11.78]Those are craft Brazilian beers.
[30:14.90]And they're probably fucking wonderful.
[30:16.52]Okay.
[30:22.56]Yeah, but not every, okay.
[30:24.16]Not every single country on earth will, I look, there's some countries that this is not going to happen.
[30:37.82]Backtrack and Barry.
[30:38.96]No, it's called, uh, it's called nitpick.
[30:42.72]Nancy is what we got over here.
[30:53.15]Alright, I have to do this or I'm going to freak out.
[31:04.09]Shit, why did I look at chat?
[31:08.59]Yeah, I mean that's a lot of beer.
[31:11.58]Maybe you know what I would do?
[31:12.46]Maybe the most popular beer.
[31:15.16]From.
[31:17.42]Most countries.
[31:18.38]I feel like, wait, I'll get shit-faced.
[31:21.78]That's too many beers.
[31:23.69]I can't drink like a hundred plus beers.
[31:27.15]If I take a sip out of a hundred beers, how many beers is that?
[31:31.21]Can somebody do the calculation?
[31:34.85]Like if you take, how much, how many ounces of liquid is in one sip?
[31:39.03]Or two sips?
[31:40.58]And how many beers is a hundred sips?
[31:44.28]I didn't even do it.
[31:48.53]You do it, lazy.
[31:49.99]I'm playing a game.
[32:02.80]10 veers is one sip.
[32:09.38]Maybe for some YouTubers.
[32:20.80]Dude, you know who I've been watching lately?
[32:22.20]Who I just like... It's just... I love it so much.
[32:25.02]It's LA Beast.
[32:29.50]It's just that... His videos just go so wild.
[32:32.79]They're just so... They're just fucking outrageous.
[32:44.39]I never really watched much of his content.
[32:48.43]But sometimes you just want to watch a guy eat like fucking 30 White Castle hamburger.
[32:54.90]And he puked.
[33:00.88]He like puked.
[33:02.30]He puked in like shits in some of these videos.
[33:13.88]Is it rookie numbers?
[33:14.90]No, they are not.
[33:15.64]Are you kidding me?
[33:26.73]I also have some more interesting news to share with everybody to share with the class.
[33:31.75]I. Do you remember when I told you that I'd never had White Castle before?
[33:40.32]I did.
[33:40.58]I did have it.
[33:42.58]I have to get to 20 seconds.
[33:46.33]I had White Castle.
[33:50.99]Let me tell you.
[33:53.59]I want to give it a rating.
[33:57.90]This shit was at least, at least a B+.
[34:00.50]At least.
[34:00.96]I don't understand the naysayers.
[34:05.48]It's like... It's fine.
[34:09.17]It's good.
[34:09.73]It's just yummy.
[34:10.73]It's just a delicious, simple, just little cheeseburger slider.
[34:24.01]Come on, I got it.
[34:34.17]It's okay.
[34:34.91]It's okay.
[34:35.13]It's okay.
[34:35.93]It's okay.
[34:41.88]It's okay.
[34:42.18]You know what?
[34:42.74]I'll give you a hot take.
[34:43.48]I think a lot of people don't want to admit that they like simple things because it makes them simple for some reason.
[34:52.26]Like, oh, White Castle.
[34:53.34]Nah.
[34:54.28]Gross.
[34:54.66]Sucks.
[34:57.36]Nah.
[34:57.58]It's not.
[34:58.06]It's stupid.
[35:00.35]Because I almost feel like a lot of people, they probably do kind of like it.
[35:03.47]But if they say they like something that's too simple, does that make me kind of like boring or something?
[35:09.01]No, it doesn't.
[35:09.59]It doesn't.
[35:10.39]Don't worry.
[35:12.27]Just eat it.
[35:15.09]Now, some of you probably really do think it sucks.
[35:17.58]And that's fine.
[35:19.57]And I know there's a lot of you that have eaten it.
[35:22.06]That were, you know, maybe you were in, maybe you were in the car or maybe you got back to when your friends were all there and y'all took a bite at the same time.
[35:30.72]And two of your friends were like, oh, oh, gross.
[35:37.22]And you were sitting there silently.
[35:38.40]I kind of like this.
[35:40.30]You were like, yeah, it's whatever.
[35:42.41]It's too hyped up.
[35:44.79]Who is he talking to?
[35:46.23]You.
[35:57.52]I have admitted to you guys that I liked the Venom movie.
[35:59.92]You know what I'm saying?
[36:00.50]I feel like it's kind of similar.
[36:12.47]The thing is, I didn't like the Venom movie because it was full of nutritional value, right?
[36:17.38]Let's use this as an example.
[36:20.28]I just liked it because the movie was fucking dumb and, like, fun and stupid and weird.
[36:26.91]And Venom's, like, one of my favorite characters, so... Sorry.
[36:39.22]I'm addicted to trying to do this, but I just can't.
[36:41.85]I'm going to be quiet until I do this.
[36:53.57]Why did I... I didn't pick it up.
[36:58.35]Ollie is calling me out here.
[36:59.69]She's saying, but how did you get the white castle?
[37:04.76]Yeah!
[37:04.98]Yeah!
[37:08.35]Uh-oh.
[37:09.17]Uh-oh.
[37:09.99]Uh-oh.
[37:10.71]Uh-oh.
[37:10.95]Uh-oh.
[37:11.91]Uh-oh.
[37:12.21]I'm in big fucking trouble now.
[37:16.58]It was the frozen shit from the grocery store.
[37:19.00]And I still thought it was a B+.
[37:19.96]Fucking hate me all you want.
[37:21.68]I don't care.
[37:22.14]Go ahead.
[37:23.86]Go ahead.
[37:24.72]You don't like me anymore?
[37:26.88]You don't like me anymore?
[37:27.80]I never did.
[37:30.36]Oh!
[37:35.80]So if I had the real thing, would that be an A?
[37:38.24]I... I would still eat a Hot Pocket and go, that's fine.
[37:55.46]That one's unfair where it is.
[38:14.03]Got it.
[38:14.51]Let's go.
[38:15.33]Nice.
[38:16.23]Feels good.
[38:25.87]Shit.
[38:26.23]It's okay.
[38:26.49]I got it.
[38:33.44]All right.
[38:35.00]I got to go here because I need 20 seconds here as well.
[38:39.32]Use the bumpers and triggers.
[38:42.61]What does that do?
[38:43.55]They kind of zoom in a little.
[38:48.41]Whoa, wait, that's speeding the game up.
[38:53.50]Oh my God.
[38:54.26]Okay.
[38:56.04]That's that's hard mode.
[39:09.07]Okay.
[39:11.35]Were you high when you ate the frozen White Castle?
[39:13.79]No.
[39:15.29]No, I was not.
[39:24.75]Was not.
[39:27.71]You know, time that person off for even asking that question.
[39:32.59]You know, like, how dare you?
[39:42.64]We'll be talking about drugs, talking about marijuana or something.
[39:47.24]Devil, the devil, the devil, the devil!
[40:05.02]Oh my god, I have... I don't have to get 20 seconds on every single map, do I?
[40:09.16]I kind of do.
[40:24.52]What sauce have I not died to?
[40:32.08]Oh, shit.
[40:35.92]Come on.
[40:40.77]I got killed by the golden saw, didn't I?
[40:48.75]Do I actually get anything for doing 20 seconds on each map?
[40:51.03]Or is that just bragging rights?
[41:06.95]Oof, that was close.
[41:09.17]It's alright, I got it.
[41:12.34]All right.
[41:13.88]So I got to go left and then up.
[41:15.76]What about down?
[41:16.54]What's down here?
[41:18.02]Survive.
[41:18.38]Yeah.
[41:18.66]Zero seconds.
[41:22.26]I don't get it.
[41:22.72]How do you die in zeros?
[41:25.10]Whoa.
[41:26.28]I know.
[41:28.88]That's how.
[41:35.42]Got it.
[41:36.98]Cool.
[41:37.48]Okay.
[41:39.01]Really cool.
[41:40.75]What's this one?
[41:42.09]Stay sharp.
[41:47.27]I don't think I got killed by that one yet.
[41:59.83]I'm now actually quite.
[42:00.57]I think the dash might actually be better, but.
[42:04.07]Feel more comfortable with this one.
[42:10.29]Wait, this is important.
[42:11.01]One of the mods, Trotter.
[42:12.77]I also checked out the beer thing.
[42:14.65]A sip is about 4 milliliters and a can of beer is 12 ounces or 341 milliliters.
[42:20.89]One sip from 100 beer cans would be roughly just a bit over one beer at 14 ounces.
[42:28.25]Really?
[42:28.57]Huh.
[42:34.23]One sip is about 4 milliliters.
[42:37.14]I could probably do that then.
[42:41.04]The one thing that I'm afraid of, of doing that stream is offending an entire country.
[42:49.40]You know what I mean?
[42:51.94]I definitely don't, I don't want to like do the, oh, the what country has the best tasting beer test.
[42:58.52]And some countries like they're ready.
[43:00.04]Oh my God.
[43:00.88]I can't wait to see.
[43:01.58]He's going to have our beer.
[43:04.15]I take a sip out of it.
[43:04.91]I'm like, I feel like that would really disappoint a lot of people.
[43:16.70]They all got their beer branded hats on and they've got like a case of it.
[43:20.82]They're like, I'm ready.
[43:24.52]And then they have to question everything.
[43:27.08]Well, no, actually, this is fine because then they would just go, no, he likes White Castle.
[43:30.08]Never mind.
[43:31.48]We're good.
[43:33.98]You don't think this is all calculated?
[43:37.69]You don't think this is incredibly calculated, everything I'm saying every day?
[43:43.19]Give me a little bit of credit.
[43:53.14]Frozen food tier list.
[43:56.14]That actually sounds kind of fun.
[44:08.03]Oof.
[44:08.27]I don't think this is even connected to anything.
[44:13.91]Shit.
[44:16.67]20 seconds.
[44:16.91]Come on.
[44:25.53]When are we going to get Otto's fog-tastic adventure?
[44:28.83]I don't know.
[44:34.53]I just thought of Otto.
[44:41.74]The trail is so long on these things.
[44:43.14]Almost there.
[44:50.77]Uh-oh.
[44:54.59]yes thank god okay I got it we got the whole bottom row cleared we should go up I'll try to see what what's the criteria ah I have to die to three more what have I not there are four discs in this room I have not been killed by oh but there's one that I haven't been killed by which one
[45:29.67]second phase of this one.
[45:31.61]Oh, okay.
[45:42.33]Hmm.
[45:47.69]Oh, you were right.
[45:48.25]All right.
[45:48.99]Cool.
[45:49.21]I've been hit by everything here, everything here, everything here.
[45:53.60]Is there one that I haven't been hit by?
[46:00.37]I think I got them all.
[46:00.97]Alright, let's just go up and then right.
[46:09.97]Survive for five seconds.
[46:11.07]Easy.
[46:14.06]Protect your bowels, dude.
[46:15.18]Don't do a frozen food tier list.
[46:42.76]I gotta get at least 30 seconds on some of these.
[46:44.52]That was pretty damn good.
[47:01.93]I'll take that one.
[47:03.15]That's pretty good.
[47:06.51]Will you do an Arby's full menu tier list?
[47:08.59]No.
[47:10.15]No, that doesn't sound like fun.
[47:15.03]I really don't think I would really even hate Arby's, but no.
[47:18.88]That doesn't sound good.
[47:24.20]Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[47:27.30]Okay.
[47:28.02]Defeat two gatekeepers.
[47:31.65]Man, I'm already doing a pretty good job already.
[47:33.67]What?
[47:33.97]Die from this?
[47:35.17]Okay.
[47:38.51]What about a Febreze scent tier list?
[47:43.08]That's the fastest way to get a migraine.
[48:03.18]What about an orange juice?
[48:05.47]Didn't you promise a BLT today?
[48:06.99]A few people are asking about it.
[48:08.09]I love how that's what people are asking about.
[48:09.63]This community... I love this community.
[48:15.05]It's just... Hey, dude.
[48:17.09]Like, um... Where's the BLT stream?
[48:19.98]Like, I've... We're just kind of curious about it.
[48:21.72]We really just want to know, like, if that was bullshit or not.
[48:24.60]Or if we should expect that.
[48:26.10]Or... I'm kind of waiting around to see.
[48:29.04]It's like... I don't know, man.
[48:31.65]I don't know.
[48:41.20]But I don't like any of you individually, okay?
[48:44.53]I like you collectively.
[48:46.57]Make that really clear.
[48:47.39]Someone just said, fuck you.
[49:00.92]Hey.
[49:10.75]He hates us.
[49:12.57]I didn't say that.
[49:27.50]You said that... I said that... No, I'm just saying that.
[49:29.78]I mean, no VLT, dude.
[49:33.40]I mean, not right... Not today.
[49:42.01]Guys, I don't even have the ingredients to make a BLT.
[49:46.84]Doesn't that seem strange?
[49:48.50]But it's true.
[49:51.10]Think about the ingredients of a BLT.
[49:53.90]I don't have them.
[49:55.12]I don't have... Well, I mean, you need sub roll.
[49:58.47]Oh, no, you don't.
[49:59.87]I don't have...
[50:01.97]No bread?
[50:02.47]Now I need to go to the store.
[50:06.31]No bread, no bacon, no lettuce, no tomatoes.
[50:09.51]The only thing that's on a BLT that I own right now is mayo.
[50:20.43]They don't have any bread?
[50:22.31]We just ran out of bread.
[50:23.21]It's not an infinite resource.
[50:26.25]You have to go and get it again after you run out.
[50:31.89]There's not a bread machine that's in your house that just, well, you may, you might make your own bread, but that's pretty cool.
[50:36.49]That's not what I'm referring to.
[50:48.42]Just use the Mayo dude.
[50:51.38]So you want me to take a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich, remove the entire sandwich and eat a spoonful of mayonnaise.
[51:01.07]So why don't you just say what you want me to do?
[51:02.49]Bro, eat a spoonful of mayonnaise.
[51:05.31]It would be funny.
[51:08.81]Childish.
[51:21.14]That was pretty good.
[51:27.14]I have 10 seconds.
[51:27.88]Oh, this is a gatekeeper.
[51:31.75]You can kill me, though.
[51:33.69]You can kill me.
[51:35.59]Okay.
[51:36.91]There's one more disc in here I need to die to.
[51:47.46]Mayonnaise is your entire diet.
[51:50.02]I mean, you make one jokey food pyramid joke, and everybody thinks you eat mayonnaise with your hands out of the jar.
[51:57.62]Is that the one I have to... Well, let me beat it first.
[52:16.27]Hmm.
[52:26.25]Also, the ad campaign that a lot of mayonnaise is doing right now, they're doing kind of like the Reese's campaigns.
[52:32.91]Like they're kind of like, sorry, not sorry.
[52:35.59]Not sorry.
[52:36.63]Yeah.
[52:37.68]Mayo.
[52:38.42]Not sorry.
[52:39.22]It's like it's just mayonnaise and I like it.
[52:40.78]I don't care.
[52:46.76]Oh, those of us that like dip our sandwiches in mayo.
[52:49.72]I don't do that.
[52:50.41]I love mayonnaise, but I don't do it.
[52:51.99]Not sorry.
[52:52.89]No, stop.
[53:04.45]Why are you so dramatic?
[53:08.71]I'm just kind of messing around.
[53:17.25]Who's that?
[53:21.24]Hey, can you wish me luck?
[53:21.96]I got finals tomorrow.
[53:25.58]You do... You do... You do you.
[53:34.54]I can't.
[53:35.74]I can't.
[53:41.56]I was gonna say, you do as best as a job as you can.
[53:49.23]God damn it.
[53:50.57]You do.
[53:52.77]You, I can't tell you you're gonna do good.
[53:54.67]I don't know, what if you didn't study?
[53:55.85]I don't wanna be responsible if you don't do well.
[54:00.83]Do your best.
[54:01.39]I hope you'd fucking studied for it and get at least a C or a B. You'll be all right.
[54:20.13]It wouldn't be funny if it wasn't true.
[54:22.97]You know what I mean?
[54:34.85]Why not A?
[54:38.69]Because you can't tell somebody to get an A. You can't say, hey, yeah, get an A. No, that's too much pressure to have to think about.
[54:57.19]Get an A?
[54:59.23]Get a near perfect score.
[55:02.15]What?
[55:04.78]I'm sorry, I'm of the opinion that you don't have to have a perfect score.
[55:09.66]You just need to know the information.
[55:12.79]There's a difference between retention and memorization.
[55:17.73]You understand?
[55:20.07]Knowledge retention is incredibly important.
[55:21.73]Knowledge memorization... Is it really retention?
[55:38.99]High Horse Andy.
[55:41.31]You know what?
[55:42.11]You do you.
[55:46.17]High Horse Andy?
[55:47.63]High Horse Andy would be me saying, I got A's in every class, therefore you should too.
[55:52.34]I'm way smarter than you.
[55:54.28]That is not what I said.
[55:55.26]That's not High Horse Andy.
[55:59.10]That's me saying I got C's and I don't give a shit.
[56:16.98]Bad role model.
[56:25.66]Your role model should be like fucking Abraham Lincoln and shit.
[56:28.60]Not me.
[56:30.54]Your role model should be like, I don't know.
[56:32.64]Wait, what's this?
[56:42.06]Clone yourself.
[56:50.20]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[57:00.77]Dude, pick somebody that's alive.
[57:02.13]That's true.
[57:09.32]That's true.
[57:10.52]Okay.
[57:13.04]Can I keep pressing it?
[57:15.74]How many times can I do this?
[57:19.57]I feel like this is cheating.
[57:34.84]Oh my goodness.
[57:37.06]That was only nine seconds?
[57:40.82]Oh, every time I spawn one, I lose a second.
[57:43.84]That's a good trade-off.
[57:45.65]Okay, I get it.
[57:52.17]Alright, we're going back to the other one.
[57:54.69]I like this one better.
[57:55.39]20 seconds.
[58:00.61]Can you please explain the stream tags?
[58:18.72]Hates having enough fiber.
[58:21.32]I don't know.
[58:26.91]The mods have access to this.
[58:31.33]They do whatever they want.
[58:47.64]Oh, whoa.
[58:50.37]That was really cool, but I didn't get 20.
[58:57.23]You don't like goat cheese.
[58:58.21]I very, very, very much don't.
[59:06.63]Goat cheese to me is, and it's so, I hate it.
[59:09.61]If I ever am out at a restaurant or something or with a bunch of people and hanging out and somebody gets like a goat cheese appetizer and everybody's eating it.
[59:21.86]It's like I I don't want that or if there's like salads or something that has it on it and people see that I'm doing the thing where you take the knife and you just scrape it off to the side.
[59:42.57]I just don't... I must have... My DNA must be different than yours.
[59:48.58]Because, you know what I mean?
[59:49.52]Like, we must have a completely different... Whatever, like, the food DNA part of your brain is.
[59:58.74]Because I find goat cheese to be absolutely revolting.
[60:04.65]And I mean... But I like blue cheese, and you think that... A lot of you think that's absolutely revolting.
[60:13.25]And that's alright.
[60:18.70]I think blue cheese tastes like yummy, creamy deliciousness, and I think goat cheese tastes like dirt.
[60:25.90]Like a soil out of the ground.
[60:27.78]Like a spoonful of it in your mouth.
[60:35.50]Shit.
[60:36.22]I need 20 seconds.
[60:43.29]You only like blue cheese to be different.
[60:46.79]Yeah, okay.
[60:49.31]One of my favorite flavors on... Alright, I'm shutting that person down.
[60:52.49]That person needs to get shut down right now.
[60:58.87]Blue cheese and hot sauce is my favorite flavor combination in the world.
[61:04.53]If there was a flavor tier list... No, sorry, it's not blue raspberry, stupid.
[61:11.10]It's...
[61:15.32]I'm sorry I'm sorry you do you all right that's the end of the story all right in real talk though uh I would put blue cheese and hot sauce at over s and it's probably the only thing that's there
[61:50.90]Why are you being so strange?
[61:52.08]I don't know.
[61:52.64]I'm just fucking around.
[62:00.57]No, I don't put it on everything.
[62:01.87]I like blue cheese where I think blue cheese belongs.
[62:09.11]I think blue cheese belongs on buffalo chicken.
[62:13.57]A buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese on it.
[62:17.07]is unmatched, it's undeniably unmatched.
[62:21.68]It is the best single probably food item in the world.
[62:25.06]It's a buffalo chicken sub.
[62:27.28]In the world, and I really don't think anything can compare to it.
[62:31.91]The second thing on that list would be a perfectly cooked piece of salmon.
[62:38.85]That's number two.
[62:44.33]That is way above blue raspberry.
[62:47.33]And we're talking flavor.
[62:49.14]Like, flavor profile.
[62:54.82]I don't put blue cheese on salmon.
[62:56.04]No, I'm saying that we've moved on to a different topic, a different flavor.
[63:02.86]Where is mint on that list?
[63:04.30]Very low.
[63:07.44]Spearmint is okay.
[63:09.38]It's high.
[63:10.30]Peppermint is... I like peppermint tea.
[63:14.49]But I think mint is... I don't hate it.
[63:18.03]I don't love it.
[63:18.99]I think it's fine.
[63:20.45]I like spearmint.
[63:23.67]Holy shit.
[63:24.81]You guys need to know this.
[63:25.71]I have to tell you this.
[63:26.63]And I don't care.
[63:27.19]You can call me like... Like Grand Shill Andy.
[63:30.46]I don't care.
[63:32.18]Do you want to know what the best hot sauce in the world is?
[63:36.32]In the world.
[63:41.06]I got killed by... Oh, wait.
[63:41.88]I can go down here now.
[63:44.12]Yep.
[63:46.93]The best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco.
[63:50.35]It's one that I have not had.
[63:51.77]Hold on.
[63:55.31]I just burped a little.
[63:56.99]It's one that I haven't... Ooh, this is weird.
[64:00.35]It's a different flavor of Tabasco.
[64:03.74]Are you ready?
[64:07.96]Tabasco habanero.
[64:09.30]Habanero.
[64:11.40]sauce is un-fucking-believable.
[64:19.27]It is probably the single greatest hot sauce ever invented.
[64:23.57]Trust me, it is.
[64:24.99]There's a lot of truths here and I'm so glad.
[64:27.05]I am so glad that a lot of you know.
[64:30.54]Tabasco habanero is... It... It makes everything better.
[64:36.64]Everything.
[64:37.26]Everything.
[64:40.81]Uh-oh.
[64:43.39]What?
[64:50.23]Did somebody say you've definitely never had it?
[64:52.52]What?
[64:53.14]Why would I say I love it?
[64:54.44]That's weird.
[64:55.94]I can absorb a disc.
[65:00.20]It's really hot.
[65:05.22]Hold A to absorb.
[65:06.16]Works.
[65:09.99]I said I've never had it?
[65:11.30]What?
[65:12.34]You just said you never had it.
[65:16.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:17.52]What's going on?
[65:21.10]Wait, what's happening?
[65:22.32]I've never... Somebody come and give me a clip or something?
[65:28.03]I said I... The bottle's gone.
[65:35.83]I haven't had it.
[65:39.04]Somebody clipped me.
[65:40.24]What?
[65:44.08]You definitely said that, buddy.
[65:46.22]That means you're, like, mad.
[65:47.58]If you say buddy at the end of a sentence, that means, like, you're pissed at me.
[65:50.31]I'm serious.
[65:50.73]Like, when did I say that?
[65:52.69]I don't see a clipper.
[66:00.19]He's not headed.
[66:02.29]What?
[66:10.26]The best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco.
[66:16.62]It's one that I have not had.
[66:25.27]What?
[66:27.69]Why did I say that?
[66:30.09]I'm so confused.
[66:31.33]I feel like you edited this clip and made me say that.
[66:35.17]I had to have been talking about something else.
[66:37.38]I think what I was trying to say is it's one that I haven't talked about.
[66:47.84]One that I have not said, I think.
[66:49.66]It's one that I have not said.
[66:51.38]Had... Yeah, I said that completely wrong.
[66:53.72]It's okay.
[66:55.86]Best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco.
[66:59.18]It's one that I have not had.
[67:00.66]One that I have not said on stream or had till recently.
[67:04.42]That's what it was.
[67:05.48]Yes.
[67:07.06]That's what it is.
[67:07.80]Thank you.
[67:09.36]It was one that I've not had till recently.
[67:10.88]I got cut off because somebody made fun of me.
[67:12.72]It was the one that I because I me and Holly just started eating it like over the last month or two.
[67:17.94]That's what it was.
[67:20.60]Somebody called me a fucking name, so I had to pause for a second.
[67:25.67]But yeah, it's one that I haven't had till recently.
[67:29.80]Sounds so stupid out of context.
[67:33.02]All right.
[67:34.04]But yeah, it is un-fucking-believable.
[67:36.99]It's really hot though.
[67:44.30]The habanero Tabasco is the kind of sauce where you eat it, and it hurts.
[67:49.34]It's... But I think it's tolerable.
[67:54.09]If you don't think habanero is tolerable, it is very hot.
[68:01.31]The other one... Oh, shit.
[68:05.78]I've had also the... I think it's... What is it?
[68:07.96]The... Scorpion sauce?
[68:12.14]Whatever it's called.
[68:15.82]It's red.
[68:16.62]It's like bright red.
[68:18.14]Tabasco Scorpion or something.
[68:21.47]That one's really good too.
[68:26.83]But that one is really... That one's like dangerous.
[68:28.69]That one hurts a lot.
[68:30.59]One drop of that is really painful.
[68:33.96]But it's really good.
[68:42.12]He's eating bugs.
[68:48.29]Alright, I got 20.
[68:51.81]What was the hot sauce?
[68:52.52]It was Tabasco Habanero.
[68:54.18]It's hot.
[68:55.96]It's really hot, so don't fuck around with this stuff.
[68:58.38]Both of them are.
[68:58.90]I might get a minute on this one.
[69:10.39]Why did I not absorb it?
[69:11.43]Oh, well.
[69:14.31]We can go right.
[69:14.87]I'm going to go down.
[69:22.95]Yeah, the habanero one, it's interesting because it's got like bananas, mango, tamarand in it.
[69:37.73]It's good.
[69:43.47]Is there any pulp in it?
[69:44.21]There's a little bit of bits.
[69:46.85]Nothing much, though.
[69:47.45]It's pretty clear.
[70:00.71]You ever have the ketchup one?
[70:02.07]I've had Tabasco on ketchup before.
[70:03.93]It's good.
[70:15.89]Shit.
[70:18.37]Oh God.
[70:18.73]Okay.
[70:19.05]Where are they going?
[70:33.09]Oh man, it's over.
[70:36.17]No, yes, OK, I'm good.
[70:47.76]30 seconds.
[70:48.44]Oh my God, I'll try.
[70:49.54]I.
[70:57.26]Jeremy, you would probably fail Willy Wonka's chocolate factory test.
[71:00.91]No, I wouldn't.
[71:01.89]I'm not touching anything there.
[71:02.87]Are you kidding me?
[71:04.89]I don't know what the fuck is in all that shit.
[71:08.93]It never lasts in Gobstopper.
[71:10.13]It never ends.
[71:11.25]Why?
[71:11.67]What's in it?
[71:12.63]Well, it's a secret.
[71:13.47]I don't want to put... I'm not putting it in my mouth, Willy.
[71:17.07]It's a secret.
[71:17.49]It lasts forever.
[71:18.15]Why?
[71:18.55]I'm not eating that until I know what's in it.
[71:29.32]Listen, Bill.
[71:30.58]I'm not putting that in my mouth.
[71:33.42]I want to see the ingredients list.
[71:35.28]What kind of preservatives do you have in there?
[71:39.58]The high fructose corn syrup in that too, Bill?
[71:43.52]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[71:51.18]Uh, how would I do this?
[71:54.68]How are you supposed to beat this one?
[71:58.41]Survive for 10 seconds.
[72:03.15]Maybe with the clones?
[72:13.38]This is... Oh, okay.
[72:20.48]Slow.
[72:24.62]Dude, this one sucks.
[72:27.30]Wow.
[72:28.02]Okay.
[72:55.89]Come on, man.
[72:56.73]I had it.
[73:06.40]Fuck!
[73:21.25]Ugh!
[73:22.83]I'm alive.
[73:26.49]Damn it.
[73:27.05]I didn't have any left.
[73:45.93]I got it.
[73:46.37]Nice.
[73:47.09]Thank God.
[73:47.97]20 seconds on this one.
[73:48.75]No way.
[73:51.27]Not a chance.
[73:57.67]I almost had it.
[74:08.52]Not this one too, right?
[74:11.56]Now we're okay.
[74:13.47]Oh, that's kind of helpful.
[74:16.69]I wanted to get hit by the discs.
[74:23.31]That was unpleasant.
[74:25.04]It kind of was.
[74:27.14]I don't think we have to do it again, though.
[74:35.89]How's the garden going?
[74:36.65]Probably get some updates there in the next week or so.
[74:44.72]Sprouts have crested the dirt.
[74:53.32]I know people really asking about the beetles.
[74:56.55]But I don't have them.
[74:59.61]Let's take it slow and I should get this one fine.
[75:06.74]I might get a minute on this one.
[75:14.62]This one's probably the easiest one of the whole bunch right now.
[75:27.95]Make it a minute.
[75:48.86]Nice.
[75:50.32]Very nice.
[75:53.30]Oh, just keep going this way.
[76:05.91]We're good.
[76:11.00]Get all the way down, all the way down.
[76:15.27]Let's go for two minutes.
[76:21.28]Clean.
[76:32.48]Right there.
[76:35.02]I can't use that anymore.
[76:36.38]I got to wait like 10 seconds or so.
[76:52.54]Oh, this could be it.
[76:58.41]No, I might get it.
[77:07.03]That's it.
[77:07.27]146.
[77:08.39]Damn it.
[77:09.75]I can do this one now.
[77:16.00]All the way down.
[77:16.36]All right.
[77:22.94]Star map.
[77:27.00]Have you seen all the memes about your stream getting nuked the other day?
[77:29.56]Yeah.
[77:31.67]Yeah.
[77:31.93]And now there is a hard limiter on my computer.
[77:36.29]That ain't happening again.
[77:38.11]Ever again.
[77:45.53]What's it do with this one?
[77:51.72]Hmm?
[78:00.21]Absorb it?
[78:01.01]Maybe?
[78:09.91]I genuinely hope you're not too stressed out about that.
[78:13.05]It sucked.
[78:14.31]I had it on really loud, but I still don't know what happened.
[78:18.36]Dude, I went.
[78:19.94]I did a full diagnostic on my entire audio equipment and system.
[78:24.00]Nothing.
[78:27.02]But there's a limiter on the stream now.
[78:29.44]I ain't having that happen again.
[78:32.79]Yeah, I've seen a lot of the memes, and it's fun to laugh at them, right?
[78:36.37]Because, like, one of the things somebody said is it sounded like somebody shot a grenade launcher into my room.
[78:41.63]It's just, like, it does.
[78:43.53]It really does.
[78:44.89]It sounds like I was, like, it sounds like I was fucking, like, somebody threw a grenade in here.
[78:51.93]But you gotta be fucking careful with that kind of shit.
[78:54.51]That shit is not good.
[78:56.91]And whether it was the game or the game communicating with the computer or something, I don't know.
[79:01.77]But...
[79:03.92]That can't happen again.
[79:05.84]That was fucking crazy.
[79:07.89]What do I do here?
[79:11.15]Whether it was a rare, incredibly rare bug in Devil May Cry 3 HD collection, I don't know.
[79:18.95]If it is a rare bug like that, though, whoa.
[79:24.84]Whoa.
[79:25.88]Really?
[79:26.72]Like, holy shit.
[79:28.78]That's ridiculous.
[79:30.80]What do I do about this?
[79:36.91]I woke up laughing the next day because it was so funny.
[79:39.96]I'm glad people think it's funny, but... At the end of the day... That's... You gotta be careful with that kind of shit.
[79:48.58]Maybe clones?
[79:49.76]Ah, what can I do?
[79:59.77]It is clones.
[80:11.00]You haven't had a limiter this whole time?
[80:12.26]I have a limiter on my voice.
[80:14.53]And I usually have... So I have a thing where the audio is not supposed to go over a certain threshold through OBS.
[80:23.77]But it went through that.
[80:27.57]And I think it's because the amount of sounds that were happening in a row, it didn't matter.
[80:30.97]It like went over the threshold.
[80:34.99]But now I have it baked in.
[80:38.59]So that should be impossible now.
[80:43.81]But what a ridiculous bug.
[81:03.04]I did it.
[81:04.00]Best time.
[81:04.56]Is that?
[81:07.90]Oh, I got it.
[81:10.22]Cool.
[81:17.86]Survive 120 seconds.
[81:18.76]That one's going to be hard.
[81:21.76]Oh, I can just teleport.
[81:22.60]That's helpful.
[81:23.74]All right.
[81:25.24]This one's a long time.
[81:29.77]Wait.
[81:33.99]How does this work?
[81:36.61]How do I add time?
[81:48.17]This thing just turned on.
[81:49.67]That was weird.
[81:51.95]Why did this one light up?
[81:52.57]Do I have to circle them?
[82:10.28]Clones?
[82:10.63]Maybe stand in both spots?
[82:11.69]Let's try it.
[82:29.51]No.
[82:39.70]Yeah, when they bump into the walls, it's when it's activating.
[82:42.08]Can I change?
[82:45.16]Can I move them?
[82:46.32]Can't make them change direction.
[82:55.57]I don't think I can absorb the gold monster.
[82:59.85]Trying to do it right now.
[83:01.39]No.
[83:11.64]Oops.
[83:13.08]Maybe I need a new power.
[83:17.20]This one's 20 seconds I didn't do.
[83:18.84]Let's change that.
[83:26.39]This is fun, I like this game.
[83:27.23]Why are you breathing so weird?
[83:30.13]You can hear my breathing?
[83:30.91]Oh my god.
[84:05.33]Breathing stream overlay.
[84:08.98]But there's like a little... There's like a little balloon in the corner that inflates when I breathe in and deflates when I breathe out.
[84:14.96]Alright, I got it.
[84:31.75]What do I need to go to the left room?
[84:35.89]Oh, it's from here.
[84:36.67]120.
[84:39.03]10 seconds, we can do that.
[84:58.36]Had to die to that.
[84:59.84]You have to die to every single saw.
[85:02.36]Don't forget that.
[85:07.42]That would make it way easier for me to be in sync with your breathing.
[85:10.46]Please do that.
[85:11.08]Plus two.
[85:15.40]Well, you're the reason why I'm not going to do it now.
[85:32.99]Hey, you do you.
[85:33.91]Yeah, you do you.
[85:39.52]I didn't even get it.
[85:59.15]Do a Silent Bob impression?
[86:01.65]That's... Why did I even read that?
[86:03.65]Because... Okay.
[86:09.54]There you go.
[86:24.55]20.
[86:26.33]20.
[86:26.39]Let's get 20 right here.
[86:37.83]Let's get 30.
[86:53.31]Yeah, that's what we call split second decision making.
[86:58.24]Whatever.
[87:03.91]This one's 10 seconds and then feed.
[87:05.77]Feed what?
[87:24.28]I think I have to go inside of the the mouth.
[87:29.86]No.
[87:32.84]I want to.
[87:33.42]OK, it is.
[87:34.36]Yep.
[87:35.64]Beat it four times.
[87:43.13]Wait, what?
[87:48.45]That didn't count.
[87:53.71]Oh, I get it.
[87:54.71]I get it.
[88:01.20]Wait.
[88:01.90]Okay.
[88:02.20]Yep.
[88:02.66]I have to pick up four of these.
[88:03.68]Get them both.
[88:15.29]Yes.
[88:15.77]All right.
[88:15.97]That's it, right?
[88:20.35]Oh my goodness.
[88:21.09]All right.
[88:21.40]We're fine.
[88:25.03]That's not it.
[88:25.51]It was four.
[88:26.53]Yeah, I got it.
[88:41.00]Alright, now he's going to survive 10 seconds.
[88:55.86]When you're gonna do your stand-up... I wouldn't last doing stand-up.
[89:03.55]I'd get up there and... I would tell one joke that I thought was gonna absolutely slay.
[89:08.93]And it wouldn't.
[89:10.67]And then it would be over, because that was my best material.
[89:13.65]I would be like, I'm leading with the best thing I got.
[89:16.51]And there would be crickets, and then I'd go, Oh, fuck.
[89:19.02]Everything I'm about to say after this is not as good as the first joke I just said.
[89:25.11]It's over.
[89:26.33]What do I do?
[89:26.89]Wish I had dash right now.
[89:55.82]shit I can do it just give me a dash you gotta improve sometimes you gotta sometimes you gotta bomb to improve yeah no that's true I think that's accurate I think like you gotta you're never gonna learn
[90:19.07]Nobody starts out perfect.
[90:20.57]You gotta.
[90:22.29]You gotta learn improve.
[90:25.44]I figure out what works and doesn't work.
[90:35.62]But he gets it right the first time.
[90:47.66]Allow yourself to grow.
[90:51.58]What do I always say?
[90:55.56]What do I always say?
[91:00.53]Yeah.
[91:04.95]Be a part of the story.
[91:16.30]I have to get 20 seconds on everything.
[91:29.87]What do you always say?
[91:30.77]You always say stones.
[91:34.72]Yeah, well, besides that, there's other things I say besides stones.
[91:43.00]Stones.
[91:49.25]Great movie.
[92:09.13]Be greedy.
[92:11.11]Got it.
[92:16.06]Does it just keep getting harder and harder and harder and harder and harder until you have to lose?
[92:21.90]I imagine so.
[92:24.69]Does each room have a completion?
[92:26.03]Survive 120 seconds.
[92:32.85]This wants me to fast forward.
[92:36.93]Oh.
[92:45.92]I was going to say, the DVD thing's never going in the corner.
[92:59.55]It did.
[93:00.23]Oh, shit.
[93:00.65]120, right?
[93:28.55]180?
[93:28.57]I thought it was 120.
[93:30.11]That was his loss right there.
[93:39.66]You guys keep going?
[93:45.32]I'm just gonna keep going.
[93:54.56]Wait, what?
[93:54.78]I thought it was at 93.
[94:04.29]It's not 120, 60 plus.
[94:08.25]Oh, I was reading the whatever.
[94:09.83]It's two minutes.
[94:12.29]Pal, what's with you guys today?
[94:13.79]You call me pal and shit like, okay, pal.
[94:16.75]All right, buddy.
[94:18.27]Hey, listen, pal.
[94:19.29]Hey, buddy.
[94:20.39]What's going on here?
[94:21.19]Hey, listen, pal.
[94:29.42]All right, bud.
[94:30.54]Hey, buddy.
[94:35.85]but he said you don't call me your friend don't call me your don't call me your friend I'm not your friend like why is that that's so funny how they're like that that's the thing to like really you know get into somebody's skin you know you just called me a friend and pal and I'm not I'm not your friend at all you don't even know hey don't say that just call me your friend I'm not a friend of yours how dare you call me a friend of yours
[95:07.84]Okay, pal.
[95:16.99]See, wise guy to me is not the same.
[95:19.81]Wise guy is implying that I'm already upset with you.
[95:22.99]Hey, wise guy.
[95:24.13]Like, oh yeah, you're a wise guy.
[95:37.11]This is a baby game.
[95:40.47]This room is easier, but I wouldn't say that.
[96:03.14]Alright.
[96:03.38]Am I just going?
[96:12.26]Do you think it's possible that an alien could be watching your stream?
[96:16.48]Uh, no.
[96:17.29]I don't think so.
[96:21.21]A network reaching that far into space?
[96:23.07]I mean, that would imply that the alien has some kind of Wi-Fi, or are you implying that there's an alien here now among us watching the stream?
[96:34.32]They're on Earth, is what you mean.
[96:35.56]What do you mean, like, another planet?
[96:38.56]Oh, I maxed it out.
[96:42.91]Three minutes is the max.
[96:52.45]So this one, there's still a disc in here I have to die to.
[96:54.97]What is it?
[96:59.60]Not that one.
[97:17.37]There we go.
[97:21.85]Alright, now let's actually get it.
[97:22.79]You're the first pick from mankind to talk to the aliens.
[97:40.93]What would your first choice of words be?
[97:47.39]Uh... Oh.
[97:50.51]That's a good question.
[97:53.38]Okay, do they understand me?
[97:55.56]Is there a part of the movie?
[97:58.90]Or is there a part of the scenario you're painting here?
[98:03.62]Where the aliens go... Hello, human!
[98:08.29]Like, they can talk.
[98:09.21]Like, oh yeah, now we know your language now.
[98:12.91]Like, they can just, like, they sense it.
[98:14.55]Okay, now I can speak English.
[98:17.05]Is that what you're implying?
[98:17.71]So that we can talk to each other.
[98:19.31]And they can understand context of what I'm saying.
[98:27.69]Okay.
[98:31.24]Uh, first thing I would say is get out.
[98:32.96]Get out while you still can.
[98:33.78]This place is fucked.
[98:34.78]Get out of here.
[98:35.68]Leave quick.
[98:36.60]Leave quick.
[98:37.06]You gotta get out of here now.
[98:38.30]You gotta get out of here now.
[98:39.02]I don't know what's gonna happen to you.
[98:39.98]Get out of here now quick.
[98:41.31]Abandon this place.
[98:42.47]Abandon it quick.
[98:53.56]That's probably the first thing I would say.
[98:58.70]And then before they left, I'd be like, you got anything weird that you can give me that I can sell for like a million dollars?
[99:07.57]And then say, take me with you.
[99:10.99]Take me with you.
[99:11.98]Take me with you.
[99:12.72]Yeah, and they fly away.
[99:15.80]And I'm like, oh, yes, I get to finally go with the alien.
[99:20.64]And the big beam comes down and I'm looking up.
[99:24.02]Oh, joyous of me.
[99:25.98]And they vaporize me.
[99:28.33]That's that part of the movie.
[99:35.99]I don't know why this has to be a movie, but I guess I just decided it was.
[99:45.58]How would you try to explain the sus guy meme to an alien who had no prior knowledge of humanity?
[99:52.87]Well, how do you explain humanity to an alien?
[99:56.53]What kind of life form is this?
[99:58.68]They can understand me, but do they understand anything about the planet?
[100:03.44]Do they know what water is?
[100:07.13]But we would have to start at zero.
[100:09.37]Like, we drink this and eat stuff, or we die.
[100:14.36]This water here, this liquid in this glass, every single being on this planet needs to consume a certain amount of this a day, or we die.
[100:24.64]I think that's where you start.
[100:27.27]Honestly, that's probably where you start.
[100:31.43]And then they go, hmm, interesting.
[100:33.47]Now we know exactly what to obliterate.
[100:36.98]Go for the water source.
[100:38.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[100:40.60]No, you bastard alien.
[100:43.20]How dare you?
[100:49.03]Take me with you.
[100:50.11]Take me with you.
[101:00.56]This room is fucking crazy.
[101:02.60]What?
[101:04.46]I need slowdown.
[101:18.46]Yeah, we already went over how hot sauce would be an act of war.
[101:21.90]We already talked about what food or what beverage you should not give an alien because they're going to see it as like an attack.
[101:36.13]How would you explain porn to aliens?
[101:44.02]Uh, I don't know.
[101:44.92]You probably feel like... What would... They wouldn't... I don't know.
[101:49.35]What kind of life form is this?
[101:50.57]I don't think they'd even... Do they know what... What sex is?
[101:56.41]Would they... I don't know.
[101:57.29]What kind of life form is it?
[102:02.33]Not again.
[102:02.75]Not again.
[102:03.25]Not again.
[102:03.61]All right.
[102:04.13]All right.
[102:04.41]All right.
[102:04.73]Fine.
[102:04.85]Fine.
[102:05.13]Fine.
[102:05.49]Let's talk about fucking Subway or whatever.
[102:19.94]Oh my goodness, this was hard.
[102:26.92]Okay, explain this to them.
[102:28.69]This is great.
[102:29.45]Dr. Clay, this is fucking hilarious.
[102:31.17]Okay, this is actually like a 10 out of 10 joke from Dr. Clay.
[102:36.77]We gotta talk about this, because yeah.
[102:40.56]Okay, Dr. Clay says, how would you explain this to the aliens?
[102:46.40]Okay, let's try.
[102:58.02]Hold on, I gotta save it.
[103:07.31]Okay, how do we describe this?
[103:08.87]How can I save it?
[103:23.96]That's annoying.
[103:26.34]I'm just gonna try to drag it from here.
[103:29.95]Okay, here we go.
[103:34.65]Excuse me, human.
[103:37.28]What is this?
[103:40.32]Well, I mean... I mean, it's... It's a... It's a video game where we were shooting and killing... Well, it's... Do you find this amusing?
[103:55.63]To shoot and kill aliens?
[103:58.63]Nah, no, of course not.
[104:01.31]See, those are, um, those are frogs.
[104:08.08]What is a frog?
[104:09.68]Oh, it's a life form here, and it's a frog, and that's just like a jokey wee, like, oh, look, it's a frog.
[104:15.74]So you think it's funny?
[104:16.90]What, you think frogs are something that you kill?
[104:19.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, we don't.
[104:22.97]I find that to be fucking disgusting and not amusing at all.
[104:26.87]In fact, this looks kind of like Jerry.
[104:31.80]Jerry's like standing behind him.
[104:33.94]No, of course it's not.
[104:38.35]They're crabs.
[104:41.69]Imagine if Space Invaders was the thing that got us like alien nuked.
[104:58.45]Yeah, that's like incredibly insensitive to the aliens.
[105:02.14]Right?
[105:13.36]That is the plot of pixels.
[105:16.86]What?
[105:27.44]Oh, it's little cartoon characters.
[105:29.22]They're not real.
[105:29.82]It's not a thing.
[105:31.36]They're not... I don't even understand what they're supposed to be depicting.
[105:36.56]First you said it was some type of animal, which was ridiculous to even consider that concept.
[105:41.53]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[105:42.83]Honestly, I'm just trying to make it so you don't fucking shoot me with that thing you're pointing at me.
[106:11.24]You got to go quick because the longer this takes.
[106:14.34]Okay, go.
[106:21.04]Come on, it's right there.
[106:26.17]No!
[106:27.13]Coward.
[106:28.23]Coward move, seriously.
[106:34.93]Damn it.
[106:54.56]I did it already.
[106:55.10]I don't care.
[106:55.66]Probably be in 20 seconds.
[106:56.74]It can be the one room I don't do.
[107:00.68]Humanity is going to delete our entire media catalog when the aliens show up.
[107:04.14]Yeah.
[107:05.43]There are a lot of media about how aliens, we wipe them out.
[107:09.83]They show up and we try to get rid of them as fast as possible.
[107:13.53]They're awful.
[107:14.47]We like hate aliens.
[107:15.67]We hate them.
[107:16.49]We hate aliens.
[107:20.31]We paint them in such this crazy light where they show up and fucking kill all of us and we have to kill them.
[107:30.38]How would we explain the thousands of pieces of media about how much aliens are terrible and they're here to kill us all?
[107:43.14]Or I feel like if you were an alien, you'd show up and you would see some of this shit and be like, we need to get the fuck out of here, man.
[107:51.69]This is what they think we're doing.
[107:53.29]This is what they think that we need to get out of here as soon as possible.
[107:56.39]Let's go to the next one.
[108:01.08]I don't think I can do this.
[108:09.48]Let's go up here.
[108:12.42]Defeat all four different antibodies in a row.
[108:22.93]How do I do that?
[108:30.03]How come you made the aliens stop sounding like nerds?
[108:35.06]Because I want to stay alive when they show up.
[108:36.38]They're going to watch my stream.
[108:37.74]And they're going to be like, why did he make us sound like that?
[108:43.90]Why are we standing straight up?
[108:47.81]Why is our posture always straight up?
[108:50.31]And we always have this kind of a voice.
[108:52.65]That's nothing what we're like.
[108:54.15]Why did you do that?
[108:56.73]You don't understand.
[109:02.03]You called them idiots.
[109:08.13]Take me with you.
[109:09.31]Take me with you.
[109:09.93]I promise.
[109:10.47]I'm a good human.
[109:14.43]And I go down, right?
[109:15.89]I'm like, no, please.
[109:17.03]I go down on my knees.
[109:17.89]Take me with you.
[109:19.67]No, you don't want any of the other humans.
[109:22.18]They're awful.
[109:22.98]They're terrible.
[109:24.42]They're filthy.
[109:45.42]But here's another thing, right?
[109:48.27]In reality, what do you do with the take me with you guy if the aliens leave?
[109:57.91]Right?
[109:58.35]What do you do with the take me with you guy?
[110:03.62]Do I get in trouble?
[110:05.56]Right?
[110:05.82]Do I get like arrested for that?
[110:12.97]The aliens show up and I'm like, take me with you.
[110:15.05]Leave, leave with me.
[110:16.43]And all these awful, horrible pieces of shit.
[110:19.47]This filthy fucking humans on this planet.
[110:22.10]Take me with you.
[110:23.70]And then the ship goes away and it's like, hey, dude, what the fuck was up with that?
[110:29.08]And what the hell did we do about that?
[110:33.75]You okay?
[110:42.80]work stress sorry somebody said I say I hate humans all the time yeah that's yeah but I think this would be this is more real right if the aliens show up and you're like actively wanting to work with the aliens
[111:15.87]Does that turn out to be like treason to humanity?
[111:18.63]It's not illegal to want to leave Earth.
[111:35.63]Yeah, I know.
[111:41.70]Alright, does that change if...
[111:44.55]All right, but how does that change for you guys?
[111:50.44]Like do, do, okay, so does it change for you if the aliens land and the take me with you guy goes and walks over to the other side where the aliens are, turns around and stands with them shoulder to shoulder and is like, huh, does that change it for you?
[112:14.39]No.
[112:17.39]Why would it?
[112:26.33]Does he kill other humans?
[112:30.48]Huh.
[112:35.08]Yeah, what's the line, though?
[112:36.64]What's the line for, you have joined the aliens, and now the aliens left?
[112:43.60]Where's the line?
[112:55.64]Are the aliens killing people?
[112:58.04]Yeah, let's talk about like a total takeover alien invasion scenario.
[113:03.21]And the take me with you guy is there.
[113:17.63]Are the aliens evil?
[113:20.47]Alright, let me beat this level and we'll talk.
[113:24.75]Are the aliens hot?
[113:25.93]Uh, I don't...
[113:48.46]That's a good question.
[113:50.06]All right, let's say they are.
[113:53.92]Let's say the aliens... Let's say they... Yeah, let's say they are.
[114:00.04]How many of you are going to be the take me with you guy?
[114:02.43]Or girl?
[114:05.53]Huh?
[114:08.71]Oh, no.
[114:09.13]Now we got a whole lot of traitors to humanity here now.
[114:12.49]Very interesting.
[114:13.25]Now we got some traitors to humanity all of a sudden because the aliens are hot.
[114:26.16]Very interesting.
[114:34.62]All right, I gotta beat this level.
[114:46.67]Did somebody say the aliens party?
[114:51.07]Um, no, not at all.
[114:55.37]Not in the slightest.
[115:00.84]Sorry.
[115:05.90]Childish behavior.
[115:08.12]What is this partying?
[115:10.38]Loud sound effects come out of device?
[115:14.87]Beverages are served that make you stupid?
[115:18.93]What is this nonsense?
[115:28.60]Shit Yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but then that happens but then one of the aliens during the course of the time during the course of the movie or whatever is seen smoking out of a bong
[115:50.60]You know what I'm saying?
[115:51.98]They got a cut to one of these aliens smoking out of a bong.
[116:06.11]And that alien is the one that joins the humans.
[116:11.74]but what the hell you've got all this alien technology and you've got you're so smart and you you know everything about the aliens but you're just smoking a bong as a comedy character fuck we can't get you to help us at all even though you're on our team you're the comic relief of this whole scenario but we have that alien here that's that's on our team
[116:36.54]Oh, but he's like looking fucking high over there and he's got like red eyes and he can't help us.
[116:41.98]Dude, this happens in the movie, Paul.
[116:57.69]Oh, nice.
[116:58.43]Okay.

[117:44.90]Are you even trying?
[117:45.78]Please, dodge the attacks.
[117:46.92]I just want to see the gameplay.
[117:52.95]This person's watching the stream muted.
[117:54.79]This would be unbearable muted.
[118:03.81]Yeah, that's true.
[118:08.54]Okay, defeat.
[118:09.56]How do I?
[118:10.02]I got one.
[118:11.84]Do I just have to pick them up really fast?
[118:13.70]It's one.
[118:18.99]Maybe just really fast.
[118:25.67]I don't get it.
[118:26.49]Beat all four different antibodies in a row.
[118:31.02]Watch the Paul trailer.
[118:32.32]I'm curious.

[121:43.82]What?
[121:44.18]This is small on my planet.
[121:45.94]A couple of times I've seen him scratch his space fan ball.
[121:48.88]Why did they edit that and splice it together weirdly?
[121:50.89]Just talking about space fan balls.
[121:53.53]Why are we holding hands?
[121:55.05]We look like a family.
[121:56.05]Hey, we're just a couple of regular guys walking down the street.
[121:58.51]Where's the bong?
[121:59.09]We got company.
[122:07.32]Where's the bong?
[122:07.95]I can honestly say this is the most fun I have ever had.
[122:12.63]I like this song.
[122:14.01]Stoke the fire.
[122:19.37]There's no bong in this movie.
[122:21.14]Just watch.
[122:28.22]It's a miracle.
[122:32.44]Why would you do that?
[122:33.10]I'm not going to eat a dead bird, am I?
[122:39.45]There's no bong in that movie.
[122:41.07]You did that joke.
[122:41.97]This is you.
[122:42.41]I'm going to watch that.

[122:57.86]Alright, let's keep going.
[123:04.22]You've done that bit before.
[123:09.54]Yeah, well, come on.
[123:20.51]It's true.
[123:20.93]He smokes weed.
[123:21.91]I'm going to watch the movie.

[123:23.93]I'm going to give you... I will live... I will give live notes to the movie, Paul.
[123:29.70]And I'll come back to you.
[123:38.45]This one doesn't have a... it's kind of loud.
[123:40.51]There we go.
[123:47.24]One hour?!
[123:47.82]Holy shit, that's a long time.
[123:51.76]An hour.
[123:59.37]Please live tweet it.
[124:14.67]I got it.
[124:14.97]Woo!
[124:26.38]Terma, why are you such an anti-noise old lady now?
[124:35.51]What does that mean?
[124:41.59]Ooh.
[124:43.33]New power?
[124:56.25]and whoa I actually think I need to die to this no wait what let's do it there's still two things I didn't die to in here
[125:25.36]That one's no.
[125:30.16]All right.
[125:35.61]This is a good one.
[125:36.27]I'm putting this on the stream for a minute.
[125:38.31]I like this one.
[126:11.51]You would have no idea how often this happens though.
[126:14.21]I do this almost every single night.
[126:21.87]And I told you this before, it sucks so bad if... This is a warning to you all.
[126:28.90]Stop.
[126:29.78]Get off of YouTube Shorts.
[126:32.14]Get off of TikTok.
[126:34.30]And I'm telling you why.
[126:36.31]Those of you that scroll that shit in bed, you can relate to this.
[126:40.62]And I've done it only a few times, but my God, I have fallen asleep to a YouTube short that just doesn't ever end over and over and over and over.
[126:53.27]It never stops in a place for like four hours.
[126:58.65]It's just like, I get it.
[127:01.11]Can you set a limit to how much something can play?
[127:04.50]Is there like a, okay, after 50 times, it should stop.
[127:09.93]Does it just loop forever?
[127:13.91]And then I wake up and it's just burnt in my brain, this 25 second clip of just the exact same cadences in the beat and the whole thing.
[127:23.22]It's just, ugh.
[127:29.83]TikTok will tell you to take a break after an hour.
[127:33.57]Instagram stops after two hours and your phone is at 0%.
[127:38.63]It should be like 10 times or like a hundred times.
[127:45.06]Like that's a lot.
[127:49.34]What is the original pic?
[127:51.62]The original picture is me watching XQC play slots.
[128:11.43]You're a mega fan.
[128:21.88]What is this room?
[128:25.53]What is this?
[128:25.99]Oh God.
[128:30.45]So how long did it say?
[128:38.48]Give me some stimulation.
[128:39.94]I am.
[128:42.16]Look.
[129:00.37]Aww.
[129:01.65]I'll try to get 30.
[129:09.02]Yeah, I fall asleep to something sitting on my chest every single night.
[129:14.04]And... It just... That iPad just sits there.
[129:20.68]And... God have mercy on your soul.
[129:25.83]If it is a YouTube short or a TikTok.
[129:49.07]Do you guys do this too?
[129:51.01]Where you refuse to give it up.
[129:54.63]You'll wake up with one eye open and painfully put this decrepit finger out
[130:02.04]Slowly push the screen up and then slowly go back to bed.
[130:09.35]I almost feel like it's one of those like an old man finger from like the old animated movies where it's like all bony and bent and like it's like all decrepit.
[130:25.12]The fingernail is like five inches long.
[130:38.31]And you know what's going to happen, but for some reason you don't just turn it off.
[130:42.00]Just close the, just close it.
[130:44.22]Just get off YouTube.
[130:46.44]Why?
[130:47.12]No, I just, I want to see.
[130:48.84]I want to see what the next food hack is real quick.
[130:52.80]And then I'm going right to bed.
[130:54.65]I swear.
[130:57.73]Oh.
[130:59.25]Oh, that's how they do it.
[131:02.57]Please repeat a hundred times.
[131:05.48]In my sleep.
[131:06.44]And fuck up my dreams.
[131:09.06]And screw up my brain in the process.
[131:23.51]Shit.
[131:25.94]I did it.
[131:26.28]I did it.
[131:26.56]I don't need to do it again.
[131:27.20]I already got it.
[131:31.44]What's the criteria for this one?
[131:33.28]Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[131:44.30]This is how I watch your streams?
[131:46.43]That's fine.
[131:49.23]That's cool.
[131:49.65]That doesn't bother me.
[131:50.53]This one's ten seconds.
[132:21.44]When are you going to play a Miku game?
[132:22.94]I don't know.
[132:29.82]When's the next Miku game coming out?
[132:31.35]I don't know.
[132:39.95]What's the first thing you'd show an alien?
[132:41.51]Miku.
[132:42.67]A Miku concert.
[133:06.42]Alright, there's equal parts of my brain would say the alien would turn to you and go, I hate this.
[133:12.46]Or turn to you and go, your planet is now saved.
[133:17.25]We are going to move on.
[133:19.15]Carry on with everything you're doing here.
[133:21.49]It's all up to speed with us.
[133:29.96]That's a 50-50 coin flip.
[133:31.32]That's either a planet gets obliterated or we get new alien technology.
[133:36.21]I don't know if that's worth the risk.
[133:45.34]This one is die with over four discs in the room.
[133:47.82]Okay.
[133:59.95]There's only two?
[134:05.93]How do I get more of these to come out?
[134:10.93]Die with over four discs in the room.
[134:14.83]Absorb.
[134:24.24]What if there's zero?
[134:39.24]I kind of... Okay, I can spawn them, but... I don't know.
[134:45.44]I don't know.
[134:52.42]Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[134:54.69]Okay, so we're not quite there yet.
[134:57.63]Defeat four gatekeepers.
[135:00.47]This will end your current... Whoa, no, no, no, no.
[135:02.77]Wait, what?
[135:04.85]Wait a minute.
[135:06.69]This is based on runs?
[135:13.32]This will end your current run.
[135:16.84]Wait.
[135:18.40]What's going on?
[135:18.90]Am I out of run tokens or something?
[135:22.24]This will end your run.
[135:23.18]Oh, okay.
[135:30.99]Okay, I get it.
[135:36.29]For a second, I thought I was ending my game.
[135:38.45]Like I was going to have to start over or something.
[135:45.85]He is so stoned right now.
[135:47.09]No, I'm not.
[135:48.59]I'm not.
[135:50.94]I just have massive attention problems.
[136:14.91]Dude, you're definitely high.
[136:16.01]No, I have not.
[136:17.15]I have not consumed any cannabis products since the Saw 2 stream.
[136:26.27]I think.
[136:31.04]On stream.
[136:40.75]I can do way longer than that.
[136:42.65]Defeat four gatekeepers.
[136:44.35]All right.
[136:44.77]There's one more boss somewhere over here.
[136:47.49]Let me try to get to a minute.
[137:02.21]Oh, that was weird.
[137:02.91]I got 20 seconds.
[137:04.93]I'm all right.
[137:08.53]Defeat all four different antibodies in a row.
[137:10.77]I don't get that one.
[137:20.96]You have to die from everything.
[137:23.54]Second I see a new saw, I'm going to die from it.
[137:37.64]Oh, it's right there.
[137:39.58]Gold one.
[137:43.48]You lying about doing weed on stream for that one or not?
[137:45.86]You both said you were high during that stream and not.
[137:48.76]Oh, you must have missed when I when I told everybody that I lied.
[138:03.72]Yeah, you're thinking of the hitman level.
[138:07.26]In Hitman 3, there was a level that was this big concrete level that I was walking around in circles and it was awful for me.
[138:14.27]I couldn't figure it out.
[138:15.31]I was really frustrated.
[138:17.21]So everyone was like, dude, you have to be high.
[138:18.91]And I was like, yeah, yeah, I am.
[138:20.37]Yeah, you got me.
[138:22.32]I just made that up.
[138:23.08]That did not happen.
[138:23.88]That was, I made it up.
[138:36.81]Give me that.
[138:37.21]I have to get hit by this gold one.
[138:39.91]Nice.
[138:40.11]Okay.
[138:55.73]Honestly, the last time that I was truly inebriated on stream, like inebriated, like really inebriated,
[139:07.63]Was probably.
[139:08.51]I don't know, maybe.
[139:15.27]Some point mid last year, last year.
[139:20.05]Not this year at all.
[139:21.83]Hasn't happened at all since.
[139:28.46]Resident Evil 7.
[139:29.42]No, it definitely was after that too.
[139:32.00]That was that was a long time ago.
[139:37.85]One of the VR streams, probably.
[139:39.23]I always drink during the VR streams.
[139:44.93]Which is both the best and worst idea ever.
[139:55.60]Vireocart?
[139:57.28]Um... I don't... I wasn't really... I'm talking, like, drunk.
[140:22.67]Is it Morrowind?
[140:23.90]I don't know.
[140:24.46]I don't remember.
[140:25.50]It's been long enough where I really don't remember.
[140:28.18]Damn it.
[140:36.39]Is the infamous Minecraft runk?
[140:38.11]Yeah.
[140:51.13]No!
[140:51.73]Fuck.
[140:52.35]I already got 20 seconds.
[140:53.35]Who cares?
[141:01.10]What about the Among Us stream?
[141:05.26]No, I don't think I... I don't think I was doing anything on that.
[141:11.92]Did I have a few drinks during the Among Us VR stream?
[141:14.18]I don't think so.
[141:19.47]Yeah, I was I was sick.
[141:21.95]Yeah, I had like I I think I think I had COVID yeah or or I did I have COVID at that point?
[141:28.71]That was around that time.
[141:35.06]Yeah, it was during the COVID yeah.
[141:47.70]This one is pretty difficult.
[141:49.08]I need to get to 20.
[141:54.74]Damn it.
[141:55.02]I get so overwhelmed.
[141:57.69]I might actually do the clones with this one.
[141:59.81]Are you going to play Among Us again?
[142:08.86]No, probably not.
[142:09.64]I don't think so.
[142:16.80]Alright, there's 10.
[142:21.32]Damn, this one is hard to get to 20.
[142:36.43]Am I collecting them too fast?
[142:42.66]What's the issue here?
[142:56.51]You got to be faster.
[142:57.23]I think you're right.
[143:04.71]I think it's all about speed.
[143:10.53]That would have been sick if I had done it.
[143:11.83]I don't know if I get this one.
[143:35.57]Shit.
[143:36.15]Maybe I'm gonna be slow.
[143:36.91]If you beat Virgil, you can do this.
[143:50.44]That's true.
[143:51.09]Yeah, it's def- it's definitely slow.
[144:07.60]Fuck.
[144:25.19]I only use the slow when I'm at at least 10 to 12 seconds.
[144:33.49]Holy shit, this was really hard.
[144:52.38]Dammit!
[145:06.62]Alright, come on.
[145:29.08]Let's go.
[145:29.52]Yes.
[145:30.48]Got it.
[145:38.42]Let's go.
[145:40.16]Yes.
[145:40.70]Let's go.
[145:41.12]There was no enthusiasm on that one.
[145:46.64]What was the problem with this one?
[145:49.18]Oh, yeah.
[145:49.64]Uh-oh.
[145:52.14]Yeah, one of you guys can do this.
[145:55.37]20 seconds in the room.
[145:56.03]That's pitch black.
[145:56.87]No.
[145:58.33]Ignoring?
[145:58.85]Ignoring what?
[146:04.16]Phantom Gatekeeper?
[146:07.44]Did I die?
[146:08.88]Okay, there's one saw in here I didn't die to.
[146:10.64]Not that one.
[146:19.18]He doesn't even read chat.
[146:20.84]No, I mean, maybe like once or twice a stream I'll look over.
[146:27.34]I'll read like one or two words.
[146:52.04]Rerecorded.
[146:52.56]It's my birthday.
[147:43.75]Oh, I want to announce this because I know people have been waiting for this real announcement.
[147:49.19]Ladies and gentlemen, at some point in the middle of June,
[147:55.92]Sorcery will return.
[148:04.05]We'll do a recap.
[148:05.59]We can figure out exactly what was going on and where we were.
[148:08.79]Sorcery is coming back.
[148:10.47]I'm actually going to play the third episode.
[148:12.55]No bullshit.
[148:15.71]Gonna play it.
[148:19.20]Sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee.
[148:23.86]Just relax.
[148:25.10]Play a choose your own adventure game.
[148:34.59]Oh, that's sad.
[149:02.67]Damn it, I need that.
[149:16.61]Grocery equals dog shit.
[149:21.45]I just want to make sure you understand you just sided with the aliens in this chat.
[149:26.45]That's a that's a treasonous statement to humanity.
[149:33.80]Now you have to start spamming.
[149:34.82]Take me with you.
[149:35.44]Quick.
[149:35.68]Take me with you.
[149:48.53]There we go.
[149:55.91]What's this?
[150:18.21]that guy's brave yeah ah we're getting close die from 45 different disc types there's still one in here that I didn't die to
[150:50.88]Alright.
[150:55.50]When's the hexes and spells stream?
[150:57.12]I need to request work off for that.
[151:04.03]I still don't understand this one.
[151:05.19]I need to die from 45 different disc types.
[151:16.67]Does that count as one?
[151:17.33]No.
[151:22.88]There it is.
[151:35.77]Absorb discs and bring them into the other room.
[151:39.43]See, now you are thinking.
[151:41.77]You are thinking.
[151:44.65]That's a lot of thought.
[151:47.09]Does that actually work?
[151:52.21]Okay, so now I'm going to die.
[151:55.22]Or do I have to beat the level?
[151:57.98]Well, I can't beat the level.
[151:58.76]Okay, let's die.
[151:59.28]Did I just fuck it up?
[152:03.84]I might have.
[152:04.14]Okay, now kill me.
[152:09.51]Okay.
[152:12.73]It does work.
[152:14.03]It do exist.
[152:16.61]Okay.
[152:16.81]Okay.
[152:26.43]Wow.
[152:28.19]Wait one.
[152:28.57]There's only three.
[152:30.01]Hmm.
[152:53.33]a disc that duplicates that's very smart I'll come back all right 10 seconds survive for 10 seconds oh this is different all right survive for 10 seconds do I have to clear this I wonder what this means
[153:27.96]I don't think I have to do this.
[153:28.82]This is kind of cool though.
[153:32.19]Yes, I do.
[153:32.77]It's the only way to make the time go up.
[153:40.39]I would kick your ass in Swindle Stones.
[153:45.49]I'm sorry, nobody is as full of shit as me.
[153:48.09]So, I can guarantee you that.
[154:07.39]one thing that I know I would beat anybody in this room it's swindle stones if I didn't have to be in the same room as other people and not be like and like turn red and shit like I would be so good at poker
[154:36.20]I'd be amazing at poker.
[154:42.28]Mr. Albertson, it's time for you to bet.
[154:44.14]I'd do the thing.
[154:45.39]I've got pocket aces.
[154:48.19]I'd be like... And I'd start turning purple and shit.
[154:52.45]And people would be like, oh, I know what he has.
[155:01.44]it's so funny that's one of those things where oh hey don't tell anybody what you have you're gonna win I don't have anything I'm wearing because you can I wait all right could I wear like a ski mask would that be like okay could I wear like a mask
[155:30.52]So, but you're allowed to wear sunglasses at a poker table.
[155:34.28]Why couldn't I wear like a, I don't know.
[155:37.00]Why couldn't I put on like a Ronald Reagan mask or something?
[155:45.95]Or how big can the sunglasses be?
[155:47.95]Could I have gigantic goofy sunglasses that cover my whole face?
[156:00.68]You can't hide your face.
[156:01.62]Isn't sunglasses hiding your face?
[156:09.95]Give me a new power.
[156:10.61]This is not good here.
[156:21.18]With an alien mask.
[156:23.26]No, I'm talking about like a private poker tournament, like a poker tournament or something.
[156:29.52]wear a full fursuit.
[156:43.29]Damn it.
[156:43.57]This one's kind of hard.
[156:44.77]Slow would be best for this one.
[156:49.17]There's no time, so just do it slow.
[156:56.54]Or are those in a timer?
[156:57.48]They might be.
[157:25.22]Ugh, slow.
[157:38.14]It's definitely slow, for sure.
[157:39.36]Ugh!
[158:02.78]If I was in like a private poker tournament and I had like a voice changer and a ski mask on and stuff, the people would still know what I had.
[158:09.03]The only difference is instead of it being you could see, you could still see my expressions and stuff.
[158:14.85]Instead of being like, oh!
[158:17.21]It would be like, oh!
[158:21.36]Ooh.
[158:28.16]Last.
[158:28.44]Last.
[158:33.74]I still didn't do this 120.
[158:34.34]Does it cost to do that?
[158:41.30]It doesn't.
[158:47.03]That's a big deal.
[159:00.46]I'm trying to use it too often.
[159:12.92]No, give me slow.
[159:17.44]Wait, maybe carve the middle out first.
[159:18.74]So I don't have to go as far.
[159:21.13]Or no, go around the edge first.
[159:37.03]Damn it.
[159:40.57]I can... It's really... This one's not even that hard.
[159:42.06]It's just...
[159:43.51]They're doing the same pattern as the spiders in Isaac.
[159:46.74]And you know that I can't handle those.
[159:49.32]It's that erratic, like, pause, go, pause, go, pause, go, pause, go.
[160:10.73]Damn it, I had it.
[160:16.36]Come on, I got it.
[160:17.92]I got it.
[160:20.12]Not even three out yet.
[160:20.90]Here we go.
[160:21.22]That thing... You imbecile.
[160:24.35]That one was stuck up there in the top.
[160:26.05]And I just...
[160:46.81]That's another villain word.
[160:47.89]Imbecile.
[160:51.01]Imbecile.
[160:51.85]Imbecile.
[160:53.81]Imbecile.
[161:03.48]This is one of those that I have to get 20 seconds or I refuse to move on.
[161:06.44]Because I'm so close.
[161:08.36]Oh, no, I get it.
[161:23.21]No, I thought it was going to go the other way.
[161:26.32]OK, go.
[161:54.04]Yeah.
[161:55.46]Okay.
[161:56.30]Thank goodness.
[161:59.67]10 seconds in this one.
[162:02.69]You should play Google Snake.
[162:06.51]Snake infuriates me.
[162:22.21]What's that snake game?
[162:24.03]It's an EO.
[162:26.71]It's an EO game.
[162:28.67]I played it for a little while, and I was obsessed with it.
[162:32.29]Yes, Slither.
[162:33.37]Slither, Slither, yep.
[162:34.31]Slither.io.
[162:36.87]I was obsessed with it.
[162:38.55]And I hated it at the same time.
[162:41.61]You would get huge, and then somebody would just do that thing.
[162:45.97]Some little new spawn Andy would just...
[162:50.88]fly in front of you and drive next to you next to you next to you next to you cut in front of you this has ruined everything and we and you know you're sitting there thinking like all right buddy you you you gotta work your way up you're coming to the big leagues right now get out of here what do you think you're doing right like that's a what that's a who do you think you are scenario that's a who do you think you are
[163:23.26]My name's up on the leaderboard.
[163:24.42]Yours isn't.
[163:24.84]You just spawned.
[163:25.90]Get out of here.
[163:26.48]Who do you think you are?
[163:32.51]Who do you think you are?
[163:33.61]I am.
[163:36.25]That's a great video.
[163:36.97]Alright, I'll take 29.
[163:48.76]Still two discs I had to get hit by.
[163:52.59]Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[163:59.17]What was this one?
[164:08.70]I think I could probably get it.
[164:09.58]This is going to be annoying to look at, though.
[164:13.36]It's going to be kind of hard in the eyes just to be aware of that.
[164:27.16]It's already over.
[164:27.70]Dammit.
[164:42.72]What was this one?
[164:46.61]Survive 10 seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[164:48.37]Survive 90 seconds total in this zone.
[164:50.69]Alright.
[164:56.09]Play Breath of the Wild.
[164:59.75]I stubbed my toe last night and it really hurts.
[165:02.87]I don't think I can perform that well.
[165:16.78]Play Tears of the Kingdom then instead.
[165:18.00]I would, I just... I have an appointment I have to get to.
[165:24.40]It's an important one, so I have to get to it.
[165:28.68]When did you say you wanted me to stop by?
[165:31.40]When did you want me to do that?
[165:32.98]What time?
[165:33.72]What time did you want me to... What time is it?
[165:43.37]Like, 7.30?
[165:44.41]Is when you wanted me... That's... That's fucking crazy.
[165:50.15]My appointment's at 7.45.
[165:51.13]There's nothing I can do, man.
[165:54.21]Sorry.
[165:54.33]Sorry.
[165:56.36]Wow, shit luck.
[165:57.72]What?
[165:58.20]I was thinking about doing it.
[165:59.75]I was thinking about playing it at 7.45.
[166:03.99]I have to get to.
[166:05.45]That's weird.
[166:06.61]That's crazy.
[166:16.64]He's done this bit before you can tell.
[166:20.68]I'm sure I have.
[166:21.56]I don't know.
[166:25.19]I mean, unironically, there is a lot of work to do this week.
[166:29.63]Okay?
[166:30.11]Like, completely unironically.
[166:33.97]There's a lot going on this week.
[166:35.92]So, I mean, that's... Hey, I can't play... I cannot play Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom.
[166:40.46]A lot going on.
[166:53.89]Okay.
[166:55.62]I want to absorb one of these because does that count as four?
[167:02.56]You got time for Discworld.
[167:04.62]This game is called Disc Room.
[167:14.56]Just say you don't like it and move on.
[167:16.12]I do.
[167:16.58]I'm just fucking around.
[167:21.87]Guys, I cannot start Tears of the Kingdom, which is like a 6,000 hour game, before I beat the first 1,500 hour game.
[167:31.52]I can beat it already.
[167:45.64]Yeah, but I just don't want to right now.
[167:48.08]I got a lot to do still.
[168:02.03]You don't start the first Hobbit movie and then skip to the next one.
[168:04.59]I actually feel like you kind of do.
[168:19.44]No, you don't.
[168:20.32]I'm making a dumb joke.
[168:27.86]Absorb it.
[168:35.91]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[168:42.20]This is going to count as four discs, right?
[168:44.90]It's going to spam a bunch.
[168:46.86]There it is.
[168:47.98]Thank you.
[168:48.38]Thank you.
[168:57.10]Wait, what?
[169:02.40]Can I just do it?
[169:05.79]How come that didn't count?
[169:08.06]It just said I had it.
[169:08.78]I just said I did it.
[169:09.32]That's weird.
[169:14.10]Another gold one.
[169:32.63]Okay.
[169:34.67]I just picked up a gold one.
[169:38.43]Can I bring that somewhere?
[169:40.13]I don't know.
[169:51.94]Die with four discs in the room.
[170:01.23]Hmm.
[170:04.35]I guess I'll just do this one.
[170:09.96]When I unlock everything, I'll probably have a clear picture of what to do.
[170:12.26]I wonder if there's a final boss.
[170:19.15]How did you find this game?
[170:22.21]Um... Uh, there's a... Gamepad.
[170:41.19]What's wrong with that game pass?
[170:43.47]What's wrong with that?
[171:12.78]Ooh, almost had it.
[171:20.56]I mean, it's a month and you get access to games and
[171:43.12]Game pass is actually good, yeah.
[171:46.26]Yes it is.
[171:50.89]At that person say that you're fucking awesome.
[172:07.31]Are the elder Wilds DLC.
[172:16.86]Oh, I really liked Outer Wilds.
[172:19.14]I was really confused by it, though.
[172:21.41]I heard the DLC was more confusing.
[172:24.79]I got it.
[172:25.07]There we go.
[172:28.91]Oh, shit.
[172:29.23]We're almost to the last few rooms.
[172:37.88]All right, this is out of 25.
[172:38.94]What is this?
[172:44.40]Well, I need to die from that.
[172:45.65]Okay.
[172:49.23]It is, but a guide is acceptable.
[172:50.89]Okay.
[172:53.21]I mean, as long as... If I could use a guide and people wouldn't be like, wow, dude.
[172:57.37]You stink.
[172:59.42]I mean, you guys would say that anyways, but... Shit.
[173:07.96]Shit.
[173:22.11]These need to spread out.
[173:22.81]I'm going to get killed.
[173:26.35]Oof.
[173:28.47]Oh!
[173:38.22]This dude smells like a game pass.
[173:40.02]Damn it.
[173:51.28]Come on, stop.
[173:54.34]I can do this.
[174:03.14]25.
[174:05.20]You stupid.
[174:13.61]You hate sorcery?
[174:14.39]I just gave you a date.
[174:15.77]I said when I was playing sorcery, I gave you a hard date.
[174:18.89]June something.
[174:32.15]Oh my goodness.
[174:32.87]All right.
[174:33.31]Come on.
[174:34.85]Stop.
[174:35.23]It's not even hard.
[174:36.42]Because they change course.
[175:02.58]I need to do it.
[175:05.38]It's objective.
[175:06.18]It has to be done.
[175:17.15]Ugh.
[175:19.49]Oh, my God.
[175:20.25]They just track you.
[175:21.07]Can you finish TF2?
[175:27.16]Do you know I got this massive craving for a man versus machine?
[175:33.52]Because I saw that Overwatch was just like, oh, no, we're not really doing that anymore.
[175:38.29]I was like, oh, well.
[175:48.27]It's funny.
[175:48.64]That was the one thing that I really actually wanted to play in Overwatch.
[175:53.18]In Overwatch 2.
[175:53.92]I was like, oh, okay.
[175:55.40]That's the only reason why I would play Overwatch 2.
[175:57.22]That was my sole reason to play it.
[176:01.41]Because I don't... I mean, I had fun with Overwatch.
[176:05.13]But then I was like, eh.
[176:06.91]When they said, oh, we're doing a PvE thing, I'm thinking, are you talking about man versus machine?
[176:10.19]Is that what you're talking about?
[176:11.07]Is that what you mean by that?
[176:12.33]Because if that's what you mean by that, you've got... I'm signed up now.
[176:17.26]So... Hearing that it was kind of not really what they're doing anymore was... Well, now I want to do that.
[176:32.47]Oh, it's right there.
[176:36.43]Yes.
[176:38.83]13 out of 25.
[176:39.05]What does that mean?
[176:44.25]13.
[176:46.93]Is it how many of these get spawned?
[176:49.63]No.
[176:50.41]15 out of 25.
[176:53.27]Wait, kill me.
[176:55.39]12 out of 25.
[176:56.13]What am I looking at here?
[177:03.33]12 out of 25.
[177:05.13]Question mark of the question mark.
[177:06.45]14 out of 25?
[177:12.17]13 out of 25.
[177:12.37]I don't get it.
[177:21.52]19 out of 25.
[177:21.86]Hold on.
[177:33.55]9 out of 25.
[177:33.81]How many tiles are there?
[177:38.69]5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
[177:38.85]There's 25 tiles?
[177:40.11]What?
[177:40.27]11?
[177:40.29]11 of what?
[178:11.47]Wait, there's, okay, there's different kind of shades under here.
[178:14.11]There's gray and then there's black.
[178:19.69]Does that matter?
[178:20.79]Does it only uncover the gray ones?
[178:29.77]All right, now kill me.
[178:32.35]Zero out of 25.
[178:33.41]Is it only uncover the black ones?
[178:40.87]That's here.
[178:42.43]Oh, shit.
[178:52.80]Oh, okay.
[178:54.84]That's going to be hard.
[179:03.08]Damn it.
[179:16.39]That should be it, right?
[179:18.10]Yes.
[179:25.60]Survive for 20 seconds.
[179:37.50]It's my favorite track of the whole night.
[179:48.79]Oh, I almost had a first try.
[179:50.55]That would have been so cool.
[179:51.71]Oh!
[180:18.85]Oh shit, we're good.
[180:30.20]There it is.
[180:35.33]That's fine.
[180:39.55]The ultimate gatekeeper is right here.
[180:52.35]This is another tile one.
[180:56.79]Alright, we're going to find where these are.
[180:59.78]This one's going to be weird, isn't it?
[181:01.06]No, same one.
[181:01.94]Same pattern.
[181:05.70]I think it's the same pattern.
[181:07.10]Okay, well, let's go.
[181:12.22]Got a raid from Chibli.
[181:15.74]Thanks, Chibli.
[181:17.18]Welcome, everybody.
[181:19.42]Currently playing...
[181:22.83]I was about to just say Attack of the Clones.
[181:26.33]I don't know why I was going to say Attack of the Clones.
[181:29.98]But thanks for the raid.
[181:30.72]Welcome.
[181:32.18]How are you?
[181:32.76]Hope you had a good stream.
[181:39.36]We're almost at the end too.
[181:45.10]No, thanks for the raid.
[181:47.18]Welcome.
[181:48.38]This one's called Homesick.
[181:53.88]It's one of the last levels in the game.
[181:57.57]And that's why.
[181:58.79]And there's the difficulty.
[181:59.91]And that's why.
[182:02.17]Actually, it's kind of horrible.
[182:05.30]I think I need dash for this.
[182:09.38]That thing just expands.
[182:11.80]Or blast would be good too.
[182:22.07]Oh my god.
[182:23.39]I don't think I can get close enough to do that.
[182:43.22]No, go back to... Dash?
[182:46.19]Can I dash through it?
[182:49.49]Find out.
[182:51.91]I cannot.
[182:52.41]He'll complete Breath of the Wild in my dream.
[183:25.91]Move.
[183:26.51]I need that last tile.
[183:27.77]Now.
[183:28.19]Move.
[183:30.15]Thank you.
[183:30.53]All right.
[183:41.25]Survive 10 seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[183:44.31]Did I do that?
[183:45.15]Uh-oh.
[183:48.85]Really?
[183:49.95]Which one is this one again?
[183:54.07]I didn't live 10 seconds in here.
[183:55.47]How?
[184:01.39]How?
[184:01.77]This is easy.
[184:02.43]You gonna play Devil May Cry 5?
[184:21.45]Yeah, I want to.
[184:26.69]I'm kind of traumatized from Devil May Cry for a little bit though.
[184:44.21]There we go.
[184:46.81]This one's still weird.
[184:49.29]This one.
[184:49.69]Okay, I have to unlock this.
[184:52.38]How do I unlock this one?
[184:53.14]Survive all five seconds in all rooms.
[184:55.12]We have to survive in here.
[184:56.18]All right, this is it.
[184:58.62]This is the ultimate gatekeeper.
[184:59.70]Let's go.
[185:02.59]Let it kill me.
[185:05.37]This is going to be horrible.
[185:06.31]There's still one disc I haven't been hit by.
[185:30.90]Damn it.
[185:31.90]I had that.
[185:32.56]I got the pattern a little bit, but it's alright.
[185:47.71]No!
[185:55.76]Go outside first.
[185:58.64]That's the way to do it.
[186:07.59]Good.
[186:09.67]I need to get hit by that, but I'm not going to yet.
[186:11.23]That was a really bad idea.
[186:21.62]Oh my God.
[186:22.36]Alright.
[186:24.89]Did I even get hit by the right thing?
[186:39.88]shit I got caught where's the sweaty pick you promised oh that's right yeah uh maybe I'll put it in discord or something in like months
[187:17.98]This one's just all, you just gotta be patient.
[187:20.26]I'm trying to go too fast for no reason.
[187:30.54]Damn it.
[187:38.26]Oh, you slowed me down at the same time.
[187:39.81]I'm kind of in trouble here.
[187:57.74]Alright, halfway.
[188:04.55]Come on, really?
[188:06.81]Sorry, don't be stupid.
[188:21.98]Get out of the way!
[188:32.01]Oh, this is bad.
[188:32.87]I did it.
[188:44.12]Now I got it.
[188:46.84]I do need to get hit by the second phase.
[189:05.51]I have to get to phase two.
[189:08.85]And then we're good.
[189:09.87]Shit.
[189:17.69]This game's fun.
[189:19.17]Yeah.
[189:19.57]It's just like a... It's an addicting... It's an addicting game.
[189:29.40]You must defeat it.
[189:31.50]I will try to defeat it in a minute.
[189:46.84]Oh, good thing.
[189:50.80]Alright, I need to get hit by one of these.
[189:54.57]That's not it.
[189:56.31]What's the one disc I didn't get hit by?
[190:05.83]Survive 10 seconds.
[190:11.28]Oh, it's this one where I need to make the time go up to 10.
[190:22.19]This one's ten.
[190:23.80]This is the only one.
[190:39.74]Well, surviving five unlocks one.
[190:41.48]Surviving ten unlocks one.
[190:45.86]This is an undefeated gatekeeper.
[190:47.80]I actually do have to do it.
[190:50.44]Alright, let's do it then.
[191:11.01]That thing gets me every time.
[191:11.91]Just don't move.
[191:26.42]Alright, this part's really easy.
[191:29.43]There's no world where I should actually get hit by any of this.
[191:34.49]The next phase, on the other hand, is awful.
[191:44.30]Sucks you in, too.
[191:58.37]Oh!
[192:01.25]I got it.
[192:02.95]No, I didn't.
[192:05.77]Did I?
[192:08.98]Big bang.
[192:19.45]I think I did it.
[192:19.87]Is it going to explode?
[192:31.59]Okay.
[192:44.75]That freaks me out big time because of a couple days ago.
[192:50.42]Oh, cool.
[192:50.88]All right.
[192:51.80]Well, I want to see the other rooms.
[192:52.74]You have to restart it.
[193:10.49]Okay.
[193:14.37]I liked it.
[193:19.35]Hello, Mr. Albertson.
[193:20.15]This is the Sorcery Enjoyers High Council speaking once again, and we are happy with your agreement of more guaranteed sorcery in mid-June.
[193:28.41]For now, we shall off our plans of making Flanker real, but we could go back on that in an instant if you once again lie.
[193:35.44]We're looking forward to mid-June.
[193:36.96]Good day, Mr. Albertson.
[193:42.89]The council's happy.
[193:44.61]That makes me happy.
[193:45.29]I'm fine.
[193:58.94]How many wood planks do you think you could eat?
[194:00.32]Zero.
[194:02.98]I wouldn't eat wood.
[194:08.34]What am I, a goat?
[194:13.53]What is an animal that eats wood?
[194:15.17]Who eats it?
[194:20.93]That's kind of cool.
[194:23.42]499 deaths, not 500.
[194:25.10]Deadliest room.
[194:27.54]I died 67 times in the lobotomy room.
[194:31.92]And the golden disc killed me 60 times.
[194:34.41]How?
[194:37.31]Termite, yep.
[194:43.19]Wait.
[194:44.31]What's going on now?
[194:49.04]We're going... Ah, this is new stuff.
[194:52.42]Okay.
[194:54.02]Can I go back?
[194:56.18]Oh, this... It just makes it hard, hard, hard.
[194:58.79]Alright, but I... Let's try it.
[195:00.59]Survive 10 seconds.
[195:10.82]New game plus?
[195:11.36]Yeah, you gotta go backwards, it seems.
[195:14.96]Wait, there's...
[195:17.25]Okay, if the other player dies, do I lose?
[195:19.69]Because that makes this way worse.
[195:31.53]I don't know.
[195:32.19]I can't tell.
[195:32.75]I didn't lose.
[195:33.49]I guess it's still fine?
[195:39.07]Maybe not.
[195:40.92]It's hard to tell.
[195:54.16]This one.
[195:54.68]Yeah, this is definitely way harder.
[196:00.13]Jeez.
[196:02.59]Okay.
[196:06.05]Yeah, I think you just go backwards.
[196:15.76]It's kind of like Dark World in Meat Boy.
[196:17.74]Okay.
[196:24.79]What about your appointment?
[196:27.25]Oh!
[196:30.99]Yeah.
[196:32.23]I... Hey!
[196:44.14]My... What was my, um... What was it for?
[196:46.62]It was... It's actually really funny because I really do have to leave
[196:56.99]It's not a joke.
[196:57.59]I have to leave very soon.
[197:00.26]I do.
[197:13.94]Those of you that don't know, if you trickled in here, I would implore you to check out Ranboo's stream on the 24th, the 26th, and the 28th.
[197:28.84]I will be a major participant in the generation loss project.
[197:35.13]It's going to be crazy.
[197:43.44]Yeah, it'll be on Nightbot and everything.
[198:01.45]Dude, what the fuck are you doing at 7pm?
[198:03.73]There's still plenty of time in the day at 7.
[198:14.28]This isn't like a diner that serves breakfast food.
[198:22.69]It closes at 2.
[198:23.49]There's still plenty of day.
[198:35.25]No, I don't have an appointment.
[198:36.19]I was just making that up.
[198:37.63]We made a joke.
[198:48.49]There are a lot of things I have to do, though.
[198:51.43]Before these shows.
[198:53.45]It's going to be really, really interesting.
[198:58.91]Definitely check it out.
[199:03.16]Again, that's the 24th, 26th, and 28th of this month, of this coming week.
[199:11.89]Can one of the mods link a stream?
[199:18.64]I'm lying?
[199:19.54]No, I'm going to be on this show.
[199:22.82]I'm not making that up.
[199:34.57]Prove it.
[199:36.37]Okay, go to Ranboo's Twitter and go look at the teasers that have been put out.
[199:50.42]I don't want to.
[199:51.24]Okay, then.
[200:04.57]I don't wanna.
[200:10.32]I have to get 20 seconds in the dark world or I'm gonna be pissed.
[200:34.16]Is it even possible for the purple?
[200:36.56]Yeah, I don't even know if the purple character can live.
[200:40.02]Maybe.
[200:40.55]That might be a part of a really, really hard challenge.
[200:45.27]Each room, the purple character has to stay alive.
[200:57.05]Alright, one more try and I'm moving on.
[201:02.86]This is too addicting.
[201:05.71]This is the kind of stuff that I would have played just in my bedroom all night.
[201:12.65]I would not have stopped an old Flash game.
[201:26.06]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[201:30.88]This would have ruined my sleep in high school.
[201:33.12]Wow.
[201:50.15]Damn it.
[201:51.55]Honestly, the corners are the biggest problem.
[202:04.00]Oof.
[202:06.11]That was pixels.
[202:07.55]That was pixels, mate.
[202:09.15]Pixels.
[202:25.62]That sucked.
[202:26.58]I thought I touched it.
[202:41.91]No.
[202:42.23]What about N plus?
[202:50.54]I actually didn't play that much N plus.
[202:55.27]I played a lot of Meat Boy.
[202:56.09]And what was the... There's a couple of the really big ones.
[203:03.42]The ones where you had to shoot people out of cannons and go further and further and further and upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
[203:11.30]Stuff like Burrito... What was it?
[203:17.02]Learn to Fly was one.
[203:17.92]Toss the Turtle.
[203:18.50]What's the one I'm thinking of, though?
[203:21.87]Burrito Bison.
[203:22.49]That's the one.
[203:25.95]Cross the Turtle.
[203:29.17]I would love a... Those dominated for a long time.
[203:35.75]Then they kind of went away forever.
[203:38.19]I miss those games.
[203:42.61]I wish somebody would make a new version of one of those.
[203:44.87]I feel like those would do really, really well now.
[203:57.47]Can you imagine that with a bunch of content and a ton more to do?
[204:05.31]There's been a couple of remakes, right?
[204:07.31]And kind of re-releases of those.
[204:09.49]But not a brand new one.
[204:11.91]And if it exists, please tell me so I can obsess over it.
[204:14.23]Damn it.
[204:27.56]Rito Bison's on the App Store.
[204:28.80]Yeah, I've beaten it already, though.
[204:30.78]That came out a while ago.
[204:31.90]That came out a long time ago on the App Store.
[204:33.44]Toss the Turtle remake.
[204:48.43]Hmm.
[204:49.85]What about tank artillery game?
[204:55.87]I remember artillery.
[205:02.75]Dude, you know what?
[205:03.55]Man, why don't we just play some of those one of these days?
[205:07.79]I would just sit there and play Burrito Bison or Learn to Fly or Toss the Turtle all day.
[205:14.57]Just sit here and just hang out and play it.
[205:20.28]Let's put that on the list.
[205:21.00]That sounds fun.
[205:28.68]I have to get this.
[205:45.18]should do it right now uh I I can't I actually can't what about I want to be the guy yeah let's revive the kind of old flash uh knights that I used to do here dos knights flash knights they were fun
[206:13.82]I can't leave until I get to 20 seconds.
[206:23.01]I can't leave.
[206:28.63]Flash is dead, but I believe there are certain things that you can still play them with.
[206:34.26]I did a absolutely minuscule amount of research, but I think there is a way to do it still.
[206:44.95]Uh, yes.
[206:46.23]Flashpoint.
[206:49.01]I need to look into it a little bit more.
[206:50.05]There's a couple other old games that I really want to try to track down again.
[207:01.88]I'm trying to remember what the context of this particular game was.
[207:10.93]Let me see if I can figure it out.
[207:37.20]No.
[207:43.32]One Adult Swim Unicorn game.
[207:45.13]That's right.
[207:51.31]It was one where you had to like bounce stuff.
[207:54.73]You had to like throw it a certain distance or something.
[207:59.09]And it was insanely, insanely frame perfect detailed.
[208:04.01]I forget what it was called.
[208:15.82]No, not angry birds.
[208:21.28]No, not angry birds.
[208:22.10]I almost just beat it and I wasn't even looking.
[208:27.82]Monkey kickball?
[208:29.24]Was that it?
[208:42.53]Shit.
[208:47.68]Backyard baseball?
[208:51.48]I don't think it was backyard baseball.
[208:57.91]Wasn't Will Neff playing that for a while?
[209:03.11]He's the goat of that game, right?
[209:21.99]This is the one right here, guaranteed.
[209:32.74]Oh, I thought I had it.
[209:35.36]That was doing so good.
[209:55.20]I gotta get them out of the corner.
[209:56.22]That's death.
[209:59.64]You piece of shit.
[210:01.12]Do I have to get through that?
[210:15.41]I can't leave.
[210:16.65]I'm gonna miss my appointment.
[210:32.84]stir said hey man where are you our appointment was a bit ago yeah but I my uh uh my stomach hurts I don't feel good I don't feel good I can't I can't go
[211:07.75]Take me with you.
[211:09.33]Why did you write that?
[211:10.67]There's no context for you to write that.
[211:18.32]Take me with you.
[211:31.08]Yeah, Stir thinks he can beat this game.
[211:33.53]Let's see him do Dark World like me at I'm doing right now.
[211:55.95]Give me the dash.
[212:06.93]Have you been in this level for like 15 hours?
[212:08.51]Yeah, I got to 19.2 seconds.
[212:14.47]It was 19.2.
[212:14.81]No, I think it's definitely slow.
[212:20.65]What is it?
[212:21.73]Maybe absorb?
[212:27.70]Is this the right place?
[212:34.82]Why is that gold?
[212:42.43]It is not that power at all.
[212:45.89]It's slow.
[212:49.91]This is the one right here.
[212:50.54]I'll get it right now.
[213:06.04]That didn't even touch me.
[213:18.90]Come on!
[213:31.55]No!
[214:00.12]Yes.
[214:24.66]Short stream Andy.
[214:26.74]Yeah, I know.
[214:29.24]I know I'm just screaming.
[214:33.04]You can stop now.
[214:33.76]I yeah, I know.
[214:36.86]I mean, I'm already I'm already late to this appointment, so.
[214:52.15]Hard mode is 10 seconds to clear.
[214:53.45]Yeah, and I just trying to get the 20.
[214:58.29]20 is the real completion of the level.
[215:02.77]It might even be higher on some of them.
[215:09.09]How am I even going to touch the squares in the middle?
[215:15.13]I've just made it down here.
[215:31.89]Oh, dear.
[215:40.20]Oh, dear.
[215:40.88]There's no getting out of that.
[215:45.39]That's true.
[215:45.85]Get him right at the beginning.
[215:46.51]That's right.
[215:47.65]What did I do?
[216:01.10]Stay out of the corners and I'll be all right.
[216:06.44]He's got to move.
[216:11.21]How?
[216:11.73]He's got to move.
[216:28.81]Almost close.
[216:39.85]Oh my goodness.
[216:40.87]That was so perfect too.
[216:41.95]He just spammed it at me.
[217:03.31]Keep getting purple guy killed.
[217:04.94]The purple guy.
[217:05.56]Hey, I'm not in control of the purple.
[217:12.25]I already blew it.
[217:12.71]I didn't go in the middle first.
[217:32.61]Get the ones in the middle and I'm fine.
[217:35.63]No.
[217:41.77]Crap.
[217:53.46]I can't stop playing this.
[218:14.78]Dude, that... The void, whatever it is, pushed it over.
[218:18.76]You saw that.
[218:19.72]That was annoying.
[218:36.89]Sticking with this formula, you... You should be able to get them all.
[218:41.01]Just go backwards.
[218:44.94]They're going to shoot it.
[218:47.24]Come on.
[218:48.05]Why am I doing that?
[218:53.01]I'm getting worried about you.
[218:54.23]I'm fine.
[218:54.67]Don't worry about me.
[218:57.61]Hey, don't worry about me.
[219:03.41]I didn't go in the middle.
[219:10.90]Well, these ones are definitely a lot more precision based.
[219:19.67]It's a great play.
[219:20.41]It's going to work out though.
[219:26.88]I can't move.
[219:27.36]Oh, I was pushed up to the edge of the thing.
[219:31.24]Yeah, I couldn't move.
[219:40.18]You can't walk into this.
[219:43.45]You can't dash through it either.
[220:03.99]Thought I had it.
[220:09.41]Somebody should make a compilation.
[220:11.06]Just.
[220:13.86]And have it have to be no.
[220:16.06]Time in the middle.
[220:17.76]Of every time that I've gone.
[220:19.22]Just string them all together.
[220:21.99]I wonder what it sounds like.
[220:24.19]Be like.
[220:26.43]I sound like a Banjo-Kazooie character probably.
[220:36.89]Get out of the fucking way!
[220:38.59]Oh my god, I can't touch it!
[220:42.63]How am I supposed to touch that?
[220:54.65]There were two that were spawned by then.
[220:56.21]It almost took up the whole entire map.
[221:09.20]Alright, ten more tries and I'm done.
[221:11.60]This one doesn't count.
[221:12.70]It only counts if I clear the middle first.
[221:15.54]Okay, this now is a real attempt.
[221:18.45]Ten more real attempts.
[221:23.65]I don't count that one either.
[221:25.55]Nope, none of these counted.
[221:29.54]I have to make one full revolution around here and get to phase two.
[221:34.58]Alright, this is a real attempt now.
[221:41.08]Oh, sloppy.
[221:43.04]That one doesn't count.
[221:56.37]That is so annoying.
[221:57.47]Why is that?
[221:58.01]That keeps killing me and I just shouldn't.
[221:59.99]I'm getting just a hair too close.
[222:03.22]That doesn't count either.
[222:05.02]I've done two.
[222:22.20]I'm in trouble.
[222:37.36]Should I play Hearthstone instead?
[222:43.77]No.
[222:54.42]It happened again.
[222:59.06]Those things never killed me until I gave myself a amount of times I can do this still.
[223:21.59]I can never touch the ones in the middle from here.
[223:34.66]I gotta get the ones in the middle right now.
[223:36.96]Yeah.
[223:39.44]I have to get him first.
[223:40.36]Otherwise it just becomes, I don't think becomes possible.
[223:57.04]Oh, you piece of shit.
[224:16.14]That didn't even touch me.
[224:16.98]Alright, five more, that's it.
[224:28.50]No, that doesn't count either.
[224:29.66]I'm getting sloppy.
[224:35.83]Anyone told us about the skunk dream?
[224:39.51]Oh, that's right.
[224:40.43]I mean, I told it in what, freestream or discord or something?
[224:46.96]I had a dream that... Hold on.
[224:52.72]I mean, the extent of the whole dream, it really is not that intriguing.
[224:56.02]It's not wild.
[224:57.08]It's not something that is going to make you go, wow, what a crazy dream.
[225:01.00]I had a dream that they were what I thought were cats in the room.
[225:09.11]Like, oh, yeah, there's just cats in here.
[225:12.77]And they were just kind of walking around and hanging out.
[225:16.74]I was like, oh, yeah, of course.
[225:18.26]Here are the cats.
[225:21.30]And it turned out, though, that they were skunks.
[225:25.96]And I looked down and realized that they were skunks.
[225:31.19]And I had been petting these.
[225:33.57]Like, oh, hey, hi, kitty.
[225:35.31]It was a skunk.
[225:38.53]But they were cats in my brain.
[225:40.35]And they were really friendly.
[225:41.25]They wasn't, like, weird.
[225:42.13]It was just, yeah, I was hanging out with some skunks.
[225:48.10]That's the whole dream.
[225:52.81]There was a baby skunk from what I remember.
[225:54.83]And I'm petting the baby skunk's head.
[225:57.25]And it's doing that thing where it's closing its eyes and leaning its head up.
[226:03.61]You know, just barely holding its head up.
[226:05.89]Like, oh yeah, I like that.
[226:07.43]That's it.
[226:09.23]And then I woke up.
[226:12.16]What does that mean?
[226:14.30]I have not seen a skunk.
[226:16.11]I have not talked about a skunk.
[226:17.79]I have not heard anything about a skunk.
[226:20.91]Why did I have a dream that I was hanging out with skunks and we were cool?
[226:24.13]I was like, oh yeah, this is cool.
[226:29.17]We're friends.
[226:30.61]It means you smell.
[226:31.63]Alright, ten more.
[226:41.99]I have to pull.
[226:42.79]I gotta pull a plug right now.
[226:48.64]Yeah, I have to pull the plug.
[226:51.21]I have to.
[226:52.29]I will.
[226:52.67]I'll never leave.
[226:53.23]Yeah, this is the end.
[226:57.07]I'm uninstalling the game.
[227:03.05]Damn it.
[227:03.37]It didn't work.
[227:17.75]I can't wait for the toss the turtle stream.
[227:19.99]That's gonna be fun.
[227:28.88]That was it right there.
[227:30.46]I just got pushed up.
[227:41.16]When they spam all in one direction at me, I can't even do it.
[227:43.99]It's over.
[227:50.70]Just like you uninstalled Breath of the Wild.
[227:55.72]You got me.
[227:57.86]Why have I not gone back to Breath of the Wild when I said I would?
[228:03.72]Well.
[228:06.29]Because I needed to make room.
[228:23.78]That was it too.
[228:24.96]I'm never going to be able to do this.
[228:33.47]Yeah, I needed to make room for Monster Hunter Rise and I thought I was going to free up some space by just deleting this fucking game and I really want to play Monster Hunter Rise and
[228:48.28]I just... I accidentally uninstalled it.
[228:51.76]And now all my games are gone.
[228:53.30]All my save files are out of here.
[228:56.40]And... I was really unhappy about it.
[229:00.11]I was really pissed off about it.
[229:07.79]And then I smashed my Wii over my knee.
[229:10.57]I had to switch, dude.
[229:14.75]What?
[229:18.90]Yeah, I went into my closet and I got the Wii out and I smashed the Wii instead of the Switch.
[229:25.56]For some reason, apparently.
[229:41.93]People heard that as weenie?
[229:46.37]Yeah, dude, I gotta get pissed off.
[229:47.93]I was fucking furious.
[229:50.26]Guys, I smashed my weenie.
[229:51.50]I smashed my weenie really hard.
[229:53.96]I was pissed.
[230:05.25]Alright, I'm done.
[230:06.49]I'm done after this.
[230:09.46]I have ten minutes to do this.
[230:10.86]That would be four hours on stream.
[230:13.28]That's it.
[230:14.58]I have ten minutes to get this done.
[230:37.66]You can't do it.
[230:38.58]It pushes you.
[230:39.44]People got timed out earlier for saying penis flattening stream.
[230:49.57]Yeah, but that was completely out of context.
[230:53.23]Context.
[230:54.11]Where's the context?
[230:54.89]You gotta... Context.
[231:00.60]If you can't... If you just say... Hey, where's the penis flattening stream?
[231:06.05]You're gonna get timed out.
[231:08.01]But if we had just talked about how I dropped a book on my penis, then okay, now there's context for you to discuss.
[231:24.44]Where's the context?
[231:27.22]It's important.
[231:56.47]I didn't tell you guys this, but it's funny enough to tell you.
[232:00.91]Enough time has passed.
[232:01.75]Do you remember when I went on break?
[232:05.87]I went on that break where I was like, okay, I'm going to be gone for a few weeks.
[232:12.17]The first day of that break.
[232:14.88]The first day.
[232:20.58]Okay.
[232:21.56]Let's go over it very quickly.
[232:24.98]I, um, I was like, all right, it's time.
[232:27.08]I'm on my break.
[232:28.64]I'm going to, I'm going to just relax for a little bit.
[232:32.60]And, and look, it's just, you know, sometimes I just want to, it's time to relax, right?
[232:38.02]It doesn't happen all the time.
[232:38.98]It doesn't happen every day, but I want to relax and I'm, I'm going to, you know, 21 and older in a state where it is legalized.
[232:49.43]I, um... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I...
[233:18.67]But, I digress.
[233:20.65]I shit my pants.
[233:23.69]I shit my pants.
[233:26.81]And I went up to take care of this.
[233:36.06]And in the process of taking care of this, I clogged the toilet.
[233:46.27]So I shit my pants.
[233:48.27]Went to the bathroom.
[233:50.37]I can take care of this.
[233:51.39]This has not happened in a very long time.
[233:53.54]A very long time.
[233:56.72]So I clog the toilet and I realize there's no plunger.
[234:01.84]I don't have one.
[234:03.72]The one that I did have, I wanted to replace because it's like, you know, every so often you get rid of a plunger.
[234:08.97]You get rid of it because like it's kind of at some point, right?
[234:11.61]You need to replace it.
[234:14.06]So I couldn't go anywhere, right?
[234:16.90]Like, what am I going to do?
[234:20.93]So I'm a little bit, you know, I'm a little inebriated.
[234:24.15]I'm obviously not going to get in a car.
[234:27.19]So I contemplated.
[234:28.29]I was like, I think I have to call Italics and see if he'll go buy me a plunger and deliver it to the house.
[234:45.08]Didn't get that far.
[234:47.32]Because.
[234:47.82]Thank.
[234:49.16]Thank.
[234:49.76]God.
[234:51.12]Thank.
[234:51.64]God.
[234:54.36]It ended up.
[234:55.60]Just.
[234:56.16]It went down.
[234:56.57]And I was like.
[234:57.43]Oh.
[234:57.67]Thank.
[234:58.41]God.
[235:09.53]Yeah.
[235:12.60]And.
[235:13.04]Imagine that conversation.
[235:14.12]That I would have had to have.
[235:15.84]Hey, man, um, yeah, I, uh, I shit my pants, and then I clog the toilet, and I, I, I'm not, I'm not gonna drive anywhere.
[235:25.07]Of course, it's not happening.
[235:27.33]Can you, you know, maybe, give me a plunger and come and deliver it, and I'll, I'll pay you.
[235:35.37]I was gonna, I was gonna pay.
[235:36.62]You know what I mean?
[235:38.28]I was gonna pay whatever it took.
[235:47.73]Why are you self-reporting all this?
[235:49.01]I don't know.
[235:51.41]I think it's kind of funny.
[235:55.78]Don't make a moment out of this.
[235:57.34]Why?
[235:57.96]That's just a stupid story.
[236:04.85]It's so funny because I ended up, you know, just kind of
[236:12.66]I think Holly knew something was going on because like obviously you don't want to tell anybody like, oh, hey, by the way.
[236:17.47]Hey, honey, I shit my pants and clogged the toilet.
[236:23.11]I have.
[236:24.65]I don't think I've seen her laugh as hard as I did.
[236:32.38]Because no, it's both things happened.
[236:35.18]Both things happened in the same like 20 minute period.
[236:38.62]So it's a come on.
[236:43.07]Come on.
[236:43.97]You can't do that to me.
[236:46.23]I'll take one of those things as enough of an annoyance.
[236:48.88]But both of them happening?
[236:55.76]That's not okay.
[236:56.78]That sucks.
[237:12.03]Oh, that was it?
[237:15.31]How long have you been on this level for?
[237:16.41]I haven't really been paying attention.
[237:23.08]How long did you... How long did you clog the toilet if it... Because I didn't... Guys!
[237:28.20]Listen.
[237:29.23]Listen.
[237:33.43]It's not like I dropped an intu- Do you have any idea what I'm referring to when I say this?
[237:40.16]I think a lot of you might think that this is like a cartoon dump in my pants when this happens.
[237:44.28]That's not how this plays out.
[237:46.74]That's not how that happens.
[237:49.41]It's not like- What?
[238:03.44]Stop talking?
[238:04.50]I need to explain so people get the real picture.
[238:11.15]Why was this topic brought up?
[238:13.29]I've been sitting on this topic for like four and a half weeks.
[238:17.11]Because I thought it was really funny afterwards.
[238:18.65]Like first day of vacation, all this happens in a row.
[238:30.90]We don't want you to visualize it.
[238:34.98]You don't have to.
[238:35.54]Just listen to the sounds.
[238:37.10]Listen to the sounds of my voice talking.
[238:55.46]Alright, this is the one right here.
[238:56.52]Watch.
[239:00.99]Bro, this is impossible.
[239:08.27]Did you flush your pants?
[239:11.57]No, I didn't flush my pants down... What are you talking about?
[239:16.07]You guys are really overestimating, like, how...
[239:37.22]You're thinking too deeply into the first part.
[239:44.71]The first part is a... Oops.
[239:47.43]It's not a... Whoa!
[239:49.77]Oh, what the... Holy shit!
[239:53.17]Whoa!
[239:53.99]It's... I can't even move!
[239:56.12]No, it's a... Oops.
[239:57.36]It's a... Oops.
[240:01.24]You guys are seriously putting way too much into that first part.
[240:16.09]Holly just said you were being really quiet.
[240:23.36]It's just silent.
[240:25.86]Why?
[240:26.58]Yeah, and that's abnormal because I'm usually just doing like Thanos impressions walking around the house.
[240:33.23]That's abnormal already.
[240:45.33]Okay, do you know when you kind of haven't seen your dog in like a few minutes and it's like, wait a minute.
[240:56.44]Where's the dog?
[240:58.82]What's going on?
[241:02.48]I think the dog's getting into trouble, I think.
[241:25.90]Same with kids.
[241:26.78]Yeah.
[241:40.08]Stop camping the middle!
[241:41.98]You're camping the middle!
[241:43.09]I would've had it!
[241:52.89]Oh shit, it's been 10 minutes.
[242:16.91]Come on, move.
[242:17.77]It's not fair.
[242:32.25]Oh, no.
[242:33.19]That's how you know he stopped.
[242:34.55]I am inevitable.
[242:39.98]Shits his pants and is quiet now.
[242:41.40]Yeah.
[242:48.02]Like, wait a minute, where's the next part of that?
[242:51.94]Usually after that, you hear slow footsteps in there.
[242:55.62]I know what it's like to lose.
[242:59.18]I know so deeply that you're right.
[243:02.04]It failed nonetheless.
[243:05.44]That follow-up did not happen.
[243:09.99]So, where is he?
[243:31.32]Alright, that's it.
[243:32.18]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[243:33.39]It's too addicting and it's challenging and hard and it's fun.
[243:38.11]It's a fun game and I want to beat this level so bad, but it's so tricky.
[243:46.38]I'm done, I'm done, and I'm going to uninstall it.
[243:49.28]That's it.
[243:49.80]Alright, goodbye.
[243:50.42]That's enough.
[243:51.16]See you later.
[243:51.56]That's enough.
[243:51.96]That's the end of this one.
[244:08.56]I have a new strategy.
[244:11.66]New strategy.
[244:12.30]Let's see if it works.
[244:12.90]Alright, I actually have a new strategy.
[244:15.84]Let's go.
[244:18.02]I'm leaving the bottom right corner, and I'm going to pull him to the bottom right corner.
[244:26.68]Actually, right now, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[244:29.55]I got it.
[244:29.87]I think I got it.
[244:33.93]You can't move!
[244:39.69]You actually can't move.
[244:40.65]There's no escape!
[245:13.53]The dash?
[245:14.15]No, you can't.
[245:15.27]The dash doesn't go through the void or whatever it is.
[245:18.98]What are you doing?
[245:19.72]Alright, this is actually the last one.
[245:40.63]What the fuck are you- I'm done.
[245:42.73]What are you supposed to do?
[245:45.99]I'm done.
[245:46.45]That's it.
[245:54.00]That was cool.
[245:55.50]And take a look at how much other hard shit there is to do in this game.
[245:59.22]There's also secrets and stuff.
[246:00.44]That's fun.
[246:00.84]I like it.
[246:01.30]I like it a lot.
[246:08.92]Oh, also, I think, um...
[246:11.59]The 4K non-crusty version of the Grotto Beast commercial.
[246:16.89]I know people have been asking for it, looking for it.
[246:20.03]It's going to be going up on the Grotto Beast channel.
[246:21.61]I think in the next little bit, tonight.
[246:27.97]You want to see it without the crust.
[246:33.04]You have to end on a win.
[246:35.62]No, that's a fallacy.
[246:40.40]That's a fallacy.
[246:48.15]But, I'll see you later.
[246:51.33]Let's actually raid someone.
[246:52.67]It's been a while.
[246:53.39]I feel like I've been streaming really late at night.
[246:55.53]I haven't really had an opportunity to pick anybody that I know.
[247:00.10]Who's live right now?
[247:01.44]Let's see.
[247:12.34]Hmm.
[247:12.66]Hmm.
[247:20.00]Yeah, Vinny's doing Sunday stream.
[247:29.84]Awful games.
[247:34.26]Yeah, let's go say hi to Vinny.
[247:36.00]Alright, next raid.
[247:38.12]The next raid I do, we're going to change it up.
[247:40.87]We'll change it up, change it up.
[247:43.61]Yeah.
[247:44.37]Vinny, obviously.
[247:46.87]Everybody loves Vinny.
[247:47.47]Come on.
[247:49.54]Yeah.
[247:49.86]All right.
[247:50.10]So I'll see you guys.
[247:51.06]The next time you see me will be on a Rambo stream.
[247:55.12]I have a pretty major part of the generation loss project.
[248:02.55]It's going to be really, really wild.
[248:07.73]Really looking forward to it.
[248:10.70]I would pay attention on the 24th, the 26th, and the 28th.
[248:12.28]24th, the 26th, and the 28th.
[248:13.99]And the 24th, the 26th, and the 28th.
[248:15.41]Okay?
[248:15.57]You got it?
[248:15.95]Should be fun.
[248:16.53]Exciting.
[248:34.07]Let's raid, Vinny.
[248:34.59]And I'll see you guys.
[248:38.13]I will not see you live on my channel, but you will see me live in the coming days to come.
[248:47.26]Okay?
[248:48.72]24th, 26th, and 28th.
[248:50.54]The 24th, the 26th, and the 28th.
[248:52.54]Sounds good.
[249:06.60]Don't shit yourself.
[249:11.45]Yeah.
[249:13.55]Let's get the credits up.
[249:15.73]Thanks for subbing, everybody.
[249:19.37]It's fun.
[249:20.07]It's a fun day.
[249:22.88]I did want to make sure I got some time in, though, before I go do all this.
[249:33.35]And where's the music?
[249:35.87]Where's the music, dude?
[249:38.97]Oh, it is up there.
[249:39.69]Okay, the 4K HD Grotto Beast commercial is there without the crust.
[249:47.01]Again, Studio Yotta did an unbelievably beautiful job.
[249:50.07]So we did want to make sure you got to see it clean.
[249:58.64]As well, of course.
[250:00.87]the fine folks at Indie Film Factory.
[250:07.29]So, go check it out if you want to check it out on the Grotto Beasts channel.
[250:20.18]Where are you going to be?
[250:22.18]On Rambo's channel.
[250:24.52]You'll see.
[250:26.84]That's all I'm going to say.
[250:29.59]Go check it out.
[250:32.80]What month?
[250:36.08]This one.
[250:42.15]The 24th, the 26th, then the 28th.
[250:44.05]Go check it out.
[250:50.01]This is next week.
[251:01.59]Oh, the... Right.
[251:03.53]That's right.
[251:04.03]I forgot about the music.
[251:06.49]Oh, okay.
[251:06.83]Let me put the music on.
[251:09.49]Yeah.
[251:11.79]That's right.
[251:12.09]I didn't put the music on.
[251:13.39]What was I thinking?
[251:16.93]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of Food for Thought, the podcast where I talk about food and foodstuffs.
[251:28.41]Sometimes maybe even talk about other things that have nothing to do with food, but we'll see how it goes on the first episode.
[251:36.86]So I don't really have a plan with this.
[251:40.40]I just knew that it was something I wanted to do eventually and something I've been thinking about.
[251:47.66]But I think I'll first, before we get into anything, I probably should probably list my favorite foods.
[251:55.94]Why would you be listening to a food podcast before the person tells you what their favorite foods are?
[252:01.65]I mean, I wouldn't listen to it either.
[252:05.23]My number one favorite food.
[252:06.59]Well, I should probably start from my least most favorite.
[252:12.07]Is that how it would probably go?
[252:15.55]My least most favorite food.
[252:18.60]is grilled chicken.
[252:20.87]It's very versatile to be used in a lot of different ways, a lot of different casseroles and
[252:29.65]sandwiches, you can put it on a plate with some rice, and it'd be great.
[252:36.45]It's just a very versatile piece of equipment to use in the kitchen.
[252:42.21]I eat grilled chicken probably every few days.
[252:46.96]It's very easy to keep in the fridge.
[252:49.86]It's very easy to keep in the freezer.
[252:54.10]But besides that, I think my number nine least most favorite food
[252:58.92]It would probably have to be spaghetti.
[253:01.74]Spaghetti, again, also very versatile.
[253:03.86]That's true.
[253:05.30]You can put beans.
[253:08.96]Sometimes I would put beans on it.
[253:12.52]Excuse me.
[253:15.02]Oil, red sauce, white sauce.
[253:18.20]It doesn't matter.
[253:18.72]Pasta is incredibly, especially pasta, spaghetti.
[253:22.34]Meatballs.
[253:23.66]How many meatball fans do I have out here?
[253:27.62]I'm sure I have quite a few.
[253:30.27]But I think that my favorite food would probably be meatballs, number one.
[253:36.03]Again, how many times have you been at this grocery store and you think to yourself, what the heck am I even going to have for dinner tonight?
[253:44.70]And I don't know.
[253:47.20]The answer to that question is I don't know.
[253:49.22]But it would usually be meatballs for me, if not grilled chicken and some bell peppers and asparagus.
[253:57.41]Okay.
[254:00.33]I think I... I think that's probably it for this episode.
[254:06.63]I'll check back in with you all on the next one, which is probably going to be this Sunday.
[254:11.99]Is it Sunday or Saturday?
[254:16.88]I don't really have anything else to say.
[254:20.42]Those are my top ten favorite foods.
[254:23.76]And I just...
[254:28.02]Yeah.
[254:30.12]We'll come back next week and we'll talk about my favorite restaurants.
[254:35.54]There's quite a few.
[254:36.47]So we'll go through those too.
[254:37.95]You really need to know this stuff before we get into anything really important.
[254:42.09]But that's it.
[254:42.61]That's episode one.
[254:44.31]This has been Food for Thought with me, Jeremy Elbertson.
[254:52.54]78 years old.
[254:54.08]Today.
[254:54.40]It is
[254:57.68]2060.
[254:58.04]And that's how old I am today.
[255:04.74]Well, it's not my birthday, but I would be.
[255:06.94]I am 78.
[255:09.09]Have a great night.
[255:11.67]See you next week.
[255:15.59]All right, bye.
[255:16.99]See you.
