[00:08.34]What's up?
[00:09.54]He made it.
[00:10.92]On time.
[00:11.30]I mean, I had to sprint in here.
[00:17.68]Okay, you know when you're like really... You really don't want to disappoint anybody.
[00:22.08]It doesn't matter if it's people or one person or whatever.
[00:25.99]You open up on your phone the clock app.
[00:29.55]Because you want to make sure that you can see the actual fucking second hand.
[00:35.05]Like, I told people I was going to be there at 4.
[00:36.71]Okay, I'm looking at the second hand right now.
[00:40.23]And it's down by, like, the 6.
[00:42.39]So I'm just going to watch that until I have to run into the room.
[00:45.96]Whew!
[00:46.66]Alright, hello.
[00:48.58]Oh, hypers.
[00:49.40]Sunflower stream.
[00:50.98]Ladies and gentlemen, I have a huge announcement to make.
[00:56.28]On par with the dollhouse stream.
[00:59.41]Are you ready?
[01:01.01]Huge fucking announcement.
[01:03.69]Ahem.
[01:05.96]Tomorrow, I'm going to show off the sunflowers.
[01:09.89]That's it.
[01:35.03]Better than the dollhouse stream.
[01:37.85]Lying Andy.
[01:38.73]I'm not a lying Andy.
[01:42.93]Can that be our fanbase name?
[01:46.29]What?
[01:47.59]Sunflowers?
[01:49.53]You guys are my sunflowers?
[01:51.26]That's weird.
[01:51.72]I don't want to call you guys my sunflowers.
[02:00.32]I want to call you guys the fucking wankers.
[02:04.60]Alright, I'm ready.
[02:05.18]I got... I got my strawberry banana smoothie right here.
[02:11.80]That's in glass number one.
[02:13.75]I've got my iced coffee over here.
[02:15.45]That's in glass number two.
[02:17.23]I've got a water over here.
[02:19.03]That's in glass number three.
[02:21.51]I have two-thirds of a Coca-Cola left right here.
[02:24.23]That's in bottle number one.
[02:26.13]I have a Sprite over here.
[02:27.41]That's bottle number two.
[02:29.84]I have two peanut butter crackers here.
[02:32.37]Snack number one.
[02:33.97]I have tuna.
[02:35.45]A can of tuna.
[02:36.11]Snack number two.
[02:37.79]I'm ready.
[02:39.83]Or in two hours, to not take a sip or bite out of one of these.
[02:43.39]And it all to go bad in front of me.
[02:46.62]We're starting with comedy!
[02:51.38]I've got a smoothie in front of me.
[02:52.80]Whatever.
[02:53.14]Relax.
[02:55.20]Is it going to be a 14 hour stream?
[02:56.96]No, it's not.
[02:57.74]I can guarantee you that.
[03:00.76]I'm very excited, though.
[03:04.46]Tweet, you dolt.
[03:05.46]Oh, shit.
[03:08.81]No more Heroes 3.
[03:09.41]That's what we're doing.
[03:12.81]Thanks for the reminder.
[03:16.75]I've been looking forward to this game.
[03:17.77]I wanted to play it since they announced it.
[03:20.67]I was a big fan of the first one, and I hated the first one.
[03:23.61]I was a huge fan of the second one, and I hated the second one.
[03:27.04]I think that's just how it is when you're a No More Heroes fan.
[03:30.39]You love these games so much, but you also don't like them at all.
[03:34.81]It's a really weird way to go about it.
[03:37.93]This series is one of my favorite actual series, but I hate these games.
[03:45.24]It's weird.
[03:47.28]He's gonna hate this one.
[03:52.16]I'm just fucking around, everybody.
[03:53.64]Come on.
[03:55.31]you'd have been here before actually some of you may not have been here before no but I like the games are always really fun but they're a little they're a little grungy that makes any sense I'm fully expecting that no I didn't play travis strikes again because I don't know it's like three times as long as all the no more heroes main games and it's a top-down game I want to like slash around the sword and jump around and
[04:23.56]Don't let Paper Mario Thousand Year Door be a wicked lie.
[04:29.45]It's not a lie, it was reality.
[04:32.37]If I'm going to stream like twice a week, somewhere between one and two times a week on the weekends, Thousand Year Door is like a thousand year long game.
[04:41.49]It's a thousand hours.
[04:44.12]I don't think I could do it.
[04:45.06]It would take forever.
[04:46.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:50.34]I'm ready to go, I think.
[04:59.15]How's your game, man?
[04:59.95]I thought you were streaming on Friday.
[05:04.77]I figured we would just go back to the weekends like we were supposed to.
[05:08.50]So, from here on out, you are to expect a Saturday-Sunday experience.
[05:15.26]Maybe Friday.
[05:17.68]Saturday.
[05:18.60]Friday-Saturday.
[05:20.15]Saturday only.
[05:20.99]Saturday-Sunday.
[05:21.71]I think it's a good place to be.
[05:25.29]And I wanted to kind of get back to that schedule.
[05:29.22]So, this is going to be... We'll do Saturday, Sunday.
[05:33.06]Because this game's obviously not just going to be one and done.
[05:35.62]I'm playing through the game because I fucking love this game.
[05:37.94]I love this series.
[05:38.70]I hate this series.
[05:40.26]So, you know, we have to do it.
[05:43.66]This one actually, I think it's supposed to be a little longer than the other two.
[05:47.24]So, we'll see.
[05:50.68]Like a bug just... No.
[05:56.06]Let's bring it over.
[05:58.74]Yeah.
[06:01.31]Alright.
[06:02.73]I'm ready.
[06:03.09]How come there's no audio?
[06:04.99]Can you guys hear anything?
[06:07.27]Bad controllers, here we come.
[06:09.15]I am playing with the Joy-Cons.
[06:11.85]And I know that that's... I don't like these things, but it says, for the best experience, use the Joy-Cons.
[06:18.72]And I just got 10 community subs from James Morris.
[06:21.54]Thank you.
[06:23.32]Appreciate it.
[06:23.76]But yeah, I was going to play the regular difficulty, not the hard one.
[06:28.58]I'm not going to play this mode.
[06:29.56]This is just like the cutscene mode.
[06:30.80]I'm going to play Bitter.
[06:32.92]Formidable foes, normal recommended difficulty.
[06:39.49]Hey, Taylor!
[06:40.43]Uh, thanks for those 10.
[06:41.25]Give you 30 subs.
[06:45.21]You didn't play Travis Strikes Again.
[06:46.49]You aren't going to understand anything.
[06:47.69]I...
[06:53.14]No, I don't, look, they're going to do the thing that they do in all these games, if there's one gigantic side game in the middle.
[07:00.91]They're going to do a previously on the next Game of Thrones cutscene that happens before I start the game.
[07:07.35]We're going to get caught up in the first cutscene.
[07:09.89]That's how they do it, because then I don't have to play the game.
[07:15.85]And would you look at that, we've got another 10 community subs.
[07:19.05]From Vinsmoke, thank you.
[07:21.72]I've not been calling out any of the big community subs recently, because I really haven't been able to look.
[07:29.30]Alright, here you go, ready?
[07:30.70]Previously on No More Heroes, I'm starting.
[07:32.64]I'm ready, I'm going to milk this, because I've been waiting for this game for like three years.
[07:35.71]You hear anything?
[07:41.82]I think there's no sound.
[07:43.26]Once the difficulty level has been set, it cannot be changed later during the game.
[07:47.17]Are you sure?
[07:49.01]I'm sure.
[07:51.35]There's audio.
[07:53.35]Oh, there it is.
[08:01.75]Oh, Suda51 loves his, like, retro.
[08:07.58]I'm looking forward to the minigames.
[08:08.92]Are there any minigames in this one?
[08:13.26]press any button death hand death claw was it stage one I remembered this game I used to play nobody at school had it but I was super into it for some reason
[08:37.97]Oh, it's called ToeJam & Earl.
[08:39.17]Oh, the murder show trope, right?
[09:07.72]But one man put a stop to this terrible game.
[09:10.96]That's right.
[09:11.96]It's Death Man.
[09:13.84]Death Man fights against the Death Aliens.
[09:16.58]To protect the planet Earth, he kills off all ten of the top evil Death Aliens.
[09:24.73]Then, when he kills General Death at the end, Death Man reveals his true identity.
[09:30.84]It's Travis Touchdown.
[09:31.94]Who is Death Man?
[09:34.38]How did it end?
[09:36.93]I can't remember.
[09:37.53]I totally forgot.
[09:41.25]The mystery of Death Man is still unsolved for me.
[09:44.67]And we're pretty sure... That lady that does that voice.
[09:48.67]A remake version was released.
[09:50.07]And we're pretty sure that they're looking for a comeback.
[09:51.67]Now I can finally find out who Death Man really is.
[09:56.04]Finally.
[09:56.72]They probably have... General Death.
[10:06.29]Oh, and don't forget the 10 to 20 gif clips of a Friends episode.
[10:12.20]Oh, there's Chandler and he's shaking.
[10:20.84]Oh shit, I play.
[10:21.52]How do I punch?
[10:23.23]It looks like Roger from American Dad.
[10:31.45]Can I jump?
[10:37.92]Do I fight this?
[10:39.14]No, I can't.
[10:39.54]Alright, it's just waves.
[10:40.40]Do I have any other moves?
[10:42.46]No, I just have punch.
[10:48.30]This is pretty good.
[10:50.68]This reminds me of, um... What's that old Nintendo game where you play as Jason?
[11:04.55]Oh, this is sus!
[11:05.71]M-m-m-monkey!
[11:06.21]Yeah!
[11:10.00]Splatterhouse.
[11:10.60]Yeah, that's the one.
[11:12.64]Wait.
[11:13.48]Oh, shit.
[11:13.84]Okay, I just had to punch that.
[11:17.50]What's that doing?
[11:18.48]Get away from me.
[11:19.50]Why is it attacking me?
[11:20.48]Oh, shit.
[11:20.98]Alright, cool.
[11:23.94]I thought it was trying to hurt me.
[11:27.77]Oh, shit.
[11:28.11]Okay, I'm almost out of power.
[11:32.35]Yoshi's Island?
[11:33.43]No, I don't think in Yoshi's Island does Yoshi put a Jason mask on and start killing people.
[11:43.29]No, you're thinking of like a fan game that came out.
[11:45.47]Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.
[11:59.29]Just got hit.
[11:59.93]Fuck, there goes my no damage run.
[12:08.17]Next game, shoot up!
[12:27.25]Oh, cutscene quiet!
[12:28.69]Oh, community subs!
[12:30.25]Thank you, Smeagol.
[12:53.99]It's the E3 trailer, I remember this.
[12:55.29]I remember the concept of this game was really cool.
[13:02.01]God, I'm so excited.
[13:02.73]Can you tell?
[13:20.83]Rain, Parasite.
[13:31.53]Let's eventually get to the end.
[13:53.87]Where's the part where he goes?
[13:55.25]In 20 years, I will return.
[14:09.45]It looks like this is goodbye, foo.
[14:16.80]You're going back to your home.
[14:23.17]Is that... Yes!
[14:28.31]Sonequa Martin-Green.
[14:33.24]Carl, look outside your window.
[14:36.38]You might want to look out your window now.
[14:38.70]Huge fan of your show.
[14:40.80]Fire at will.
[14:42.20]Sonequa!
[15:06.29]That ad has been in my head for the last two months.
[15:08.70]I can't get rid of it.
[15:10.84]It happens every time I open Twitter.
[15:13.60]They must have me on an algorithm.
[15:15.22]I see it every time.
[15:17.66]Sir, it is time for the board meeting.
[15:20.36]We need to go back in.
[15:22.85]Just give me a minute.
[15:24.87]I've got an appointment.
[15:27.07]But I am not aware of... Just watch.
[15:36.88]I just opened Twitter.
[15:37.90]I just opened Twitter and here it is.
[15:40.42]But I'll wait.
[15:51.17]Is that you?
[15:53.47]Back.
[15:54.01]Damon, I love you.
[15:55.91]Looks like you've been living large, Damon.
[16:01.67]You used our powers to get yourself a pretty sweet piece of the pie.
[16:06.21]Are you really Fu?
[16:08.27]Thanks to you, I was able to return to my land.
[16:11.35]And now here I am, a full-on prince.
[16:15.53]Congratulations.
[16:17.43]But I'm hella bored.
[16:19.63]I got nothing to do.
[16:20.95]Animation's so weird.
[16:21.59]I worked out the neighboring planet, but then I was court-martialed and exiled to the Black Hole Prison.
[16:28.52]These dudes are my buddies.
[16:30.58]We met in the hole.
[16:32.47]Oh my god!
[16:57.88]Holy shit!
[16:59.56]Well...
[17:25.77]There's your intro.
[17:26.41]We saw most of that during E3.
[17:29.17]It's a cool concept.
[17:29.97]I like it.
[17:32.79]Is this old Travis?
[17:40.07]It is old Travis.
[17:41.84]Isn't it?
[17:44.60]Access door.
[17:46.16]Before we get started, though, I'm sorry.
[17:47.60]People think I'm fucking crazy, but I just opened Twitter.
[17:50.24]I just opened it.
[17:51.06]Oh, look there.
[18:04.06]I just... Every time I open Twitter, it happens.
[18:06.14]Every single fucking time.
[18:09.27]And the thing is, I watch it every time, too.
[18:11.73]Like, they have me.
[18:13.41]I'm like a Twitter ad whale.
[18:16.31]Okay?
[18:17.77]I watch the ad like 400 times.
[18:21.50]I don't know how many impressions I'm giving this company or whatever, but I...
[18:25.96]I don't know.
[18:26.28]I think it's... I like listening to it.
[18:28.38]I don't know why.
[18:29.06]I just... It's something about it.
[18:35.56]And they have like three versions of it.
[18:37.62]And they're all so like dumpy.
[18:38.98]They're all like such shitty ads.
[18:40.06]Alright, hold on.
[18:41.00]Is there anything I can do in here?
[18:47.61]This is the apartment, right?
[18:48.39]From the first two games?
[18:49.09]What's wrong with my leg?
[18:54.69]You got influenced.
[18:55.55]Should I go to the bathroom?
[18:58.55]Is it the save in the bathroom?
[19:00.21]No.
[19:00.45]I think we just have to do.
[19:01.47]We just have to go.
[19:04.65]It's on my hand.
[19:05.25]Do I have the infinity gauntlet?
[19:11.49]Next stream you should eat shit on camera.
[19:14.04]Well next stream you won't be here because you're going to be banned for 24 hours.
[19:19.70]was today the fourth of July if not is the empire striking back or what it looks like things are gonna get weird today give him like five minute time out that's what are you doing god hey what a shitty town what could possibly even be here like what the hell is the prince even worried about
[19:55.74]Alright, there's like big satellites.
[19:57.68]What was that light?
[20:02.16]Woo, that makes a much nicer parking lot, huh?
[20:05.58]I'm going to build my tower right here.
[20:07.95]Okay, you go and clean up.
[20:11.17]My radar's picking up something weird.
[20:13.43]What is this camp?
[20:14.91]Yeah, whatever.
[20:17.17]You guys will do.
[20:18.45]Want to go kill it for me?
[20:22.10]When you talk about bringing in, like, cosmic shit and superheroes from other dimensions, Suda51 just drew every character he thought was cool looking and just put him in a game.
[20:32.72]Like, he just got a bunch of concept artists and was like, just make a bunch of crazy shit and there's no creative anything.
[20:36.90]You just do whatever you want.
[20:40.02]That's kind of refreshing in a way.
[20:41.59]I like it.
[20:43.37]Hey, can I ask you something?
[20:45.79]Are you guys aliens?
[20:48.47]I don't think they're here to talk, Master.
[20:50.80]Oh shit!
[20:51.98]This looks like fun!
[20:53.30]Let me play!
[20:54.68]Oh, I know these people.
[20:57.30]You know how to take these guys down?
[20:59.20]Beat them to fucking death!
[21:01.27]Strategy is born from battle.
[21:03.41]I'll take the one in the middle.
[21:05.35]Do whatever you want with the rest.
[21:06.59]Somebody has like the... Let me have some fun!
[21:08.33]He's got like the snake like scar.
[21:11.87]Start the game.
[21:14.15]Wait, how am I supposed to fight?
[21:15.11]A gamer fighting for their life is beautiful.
[21:20.23]Hey there, my name is Taro Gida.
[21:22.27]My gamer buddies usually call me Master Gida.
[21:25.42]From here on out, I'm going to be popping up in this window here and there to teach you some basics of the game.
[21:30.72]Of course, you can go ahead and skip over this if you want to.
[21:33.64]I'll send you all this info via mail later.
[21:35.81]So check it out when you get the chance.
[21:37.93]So you might just discover something new.
[21:38.97]Alright.
[21:41.20]Alright.
[21:42.90]Normal attack, heavy attack, jump, dodge.
[21:45.09]Alright.
[21:45.35]That's pretty easy, I think.
[21:46.81]Basic controls.
[21:47.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:48.13]So we're going to swing, heavy swing, jump, dodge.
[21:51.83]Why is there a liquid iPad video in the corner?
[21:53.85]That is pretty good quality so far.
[21:55.35]Dodger.
[21:55.53]Alright, that's back.
[21:56.71]Alright, shut up.
[21:57.29]How do I close the ad?
[22:23.01]No, wait, I got a perfect thing for the video.
[22:24.85]Put the, put the, put the, put that shit in the corner right here.
[22:28.61]I don't know, is that legal?
[22:30.11]But you can't do that, never mind.
[22:31.19]But imagine if that was there.
[22:32.05]I want to get the banner ads off.
[22:35.39]Oh, wait, viewpoint control.
[22:38.62]I didn't do the tutorial.
[22:46.38]Oops.
[22:47.12]I, like, killed him already.
[22:48.18]Oh, there's a guard.
[22:48.96]Alright, guard is lock on and guard is hold zeal.
[22:52.22]Zeal?
[22:52.40]That's what I'm doing, right?
[22:53.16]Oh, okay.
[22:53.46]He blocked right there.
[22:54.20]Alright, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[23:09.46]Attacking and guarding with the beam katana will consume power.
[23:13.72]End up with no power and you're screwed.
[23:15.73]So pay attention to the power gauge at the top right of the screen.
[23:18.03]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:18.85]Alright, so R and right or R and shake is charge the beam katana, right?
[23:24.01]Okay, so let's do it.
[23:25.63]Alright, you can actually move around in this time.
[23:31.28]Before you had to stay still.
[23:32.10]That's actually pretty good.
[23:32.86]That's awesome.
[23:35.41]Yes, I made an enemy with your beam katana or deal hardcore damage to a boss.
[23:38.89]R or killer slash.
[23:42.77]You're playing with the Joy-Con in both hands.
[23:44.55]Swing the R in the direction of the arrows.
[23:46.32]Right, yeah.
[23:47.02]Just like in the other games.
[23:47.78]Feels really good.
[23:54.52]Nice.
[23:56.96]Okay, it's fun.
[24:00.31]That was the guy that was talking all that shit, wasn't it?
[24:13.27]Drink some more of my smoothie.
[24:14.62]Base cam or riot?
[24:15.96]Nope.
[24:16.14]Power crystals?
[24:27.48]What?
[24:27.78]This might be Travis Strikes Again info.
[24:49.13]Hmm.
[25:20.84]okay we missed a lot in the last game oh he does a hench in a go-go
[25:46.36]They don't explain how they got this.
[25:48.20]Oh, so, okay.
[25:49.08]Maybe we didn't miss very much.
[25:50.40]He just has this.
[25:51.98]Fuckhead!
[25:58.04]There's the Travis I know.
[26:00.88]He better be in Smash Brothers eventually.
[26:02.60]Like, I'd be upset if he wasn't.
[26:04.36]You're behind enemy lines now.
[26:06.64]Huh?
[26:07.71]Gene?
[26:08.93]Have you always sounded like that?
[26:13.33]Something wrong?
[26:14.80]No, it's just I always assumed you were a female.
[26:19.32]Are you tweaking?
[26:20.50]This is how I've always sounded.
[26:22.42]That's pretty badass.
[26:24.75]If there's anything you're not clear on, let me know.
[26:27.45]I'll lay it out for you.
[26:29.12]Rick?
[26:30.02]What?
[26:30.20]What is that?
[26:30.61]Who is that?
[26:31.17]Let's go!
[26:31.57]I like the heavy slashes.
[27:03.25]Oh, this is good.
[27:04.87]This is fun.
[27:05.91]This is fun.
[27:06.63]Oh, I got a battery.
[27:19.70]So much Android blood.
[27:26.76]What is he saying?
[27:27.76]Boist the fuck out?
[27:31.29]As you can see, things got all funky real quick.
[27:35.21]There's probably some planet-eating type dude waiting for me up ahead.
[27:39.57]All yoked and powerful and trying to take over the world or something.
[27:46.67]This looks so good.
[27:47.43]Let's hold on.
[27:48.67]I don't read any reviews.
[27:51.49]I don't care.
[27:51.85]I just go in blind.
[27:53.03]I don't... Let's just play.
[27:53.81]Especially the game that you've been looking forward to, right?
[28:18.40]Now, I feel bad for the people that did that with Cyberpunk.
[28:20.80]But, you know.
[28:21.54]I've been looking forward to this for like the last three or four years.
[28:25.22]More than that.
[28:26.34]There we go.
[28:27.04]Are we just going right into a boss or something?
[28:33.18]Like, right immediately into a...
[28:51.79]Dash?
[28:52.93]Oh, okay.
[28:53.35]Press it in.
[28:53.73]I like how they did make him older, right?
[29:33.65]I want to play the mini games.
[29:35.53]I'm so excited.
[29:36.41]I can't wait.
[29:38.71]Access the sushi shop.
[29:42.21]Is this the sushi shop?
[29:47.25]Hey, Arashai.
[29:48.60]I am Bugzaburo.
[29:51.36]Yummy, yummy, yummy.
[29:52.32]Get some fish in your tummy.
[29:55.42]Probably thinking, what's a sushi place doing inside of a UFO like this, right?
[29:58.30]Well, but listen, buddy.
[30:00.69]I used to have a shop in Santa Destroy, but it got sucked up in that light from the sky, and I ended up in here somehow.
[30:07.41]Anyways, enough about my problems.
[30:08.31]How about some sushi, buddy?
[30:10.75]Use L and R to choose takeout or eat in.
[30:14.50]Takeout is, well, exactly what it sounds like.
[30:16.26]Grab a quick bite when you get hungry during battle.
[30:20.34]What's with the counter over on the right side?
[30:22.34]Why is it counting?
[30:24.33]Okay, so you can take it with you.
[30:25.43]Eat in means you can sit here and get filled up and get ripped rare in to go for the next battle.
[30:31.31]Is this like Monster Hunter?
[30:32.30]Okay, we have excellent choices.
[30:36.20]I'm a huge fan of Don Mai Sushi.
[30:42.02]They've got all sorts of sushi to choose from.
[30:43.60]Sushi's actually a crucial item in battle.
[30:46.57]Eat in, sushi effects will last till your next battle ends.
[30:49.35]Okay, so it is like Monster Hunter.
[30:51.50]You know, like what gamers call a buff.
[30:53.94]Takeout sushi can be eaten during a battle.
[30:55.86]You'll be left vulnerable while eating, so be careful.
[30:57.84]Use the left and right D-pad to select from your takeout sushi and eat it.
[31:02.74]Huh.
[31:04.66]Interesting.
[31:05.72]It replenishes health when eaten during battle.
[31:07.94]Wait, is this like a... This is the... I want to listen to this for a second.
[31:12.29]This is a theme song.
[31:28.27]Holy shit, this is good.
[31:29.99]Alright, the Good Old Cucumber Roll replenishes power when eaten so that... How long does it take to eat?
[31:36.80]Why would I eat these outside of combat?
[31:38.46]Why wouldn't I take it?
[31:39.22]Increases your attention when eaten during battle.
[31:42.98]Temporarily increases attack power when eaten.
[31:47.90]Improves your chances on the slash reel when eaten during battle.
[31:52.14]Partially replenishes death skill gauge during cooldown when eaten during battle.
[31:57.34]So, wait, does this... Okay, so it increases your tension.
[32:00.58]Is that just gonna happen?
[32:02.46]Press R. Oh, shit!
[32:04.32]There's two tabs!
[32:05.12]What, am I stupid?
[32:05.84]Alright, what's this?
[32:09.00]Load with only the best fish.
[32:10.14]When you die, you replenish your health.
[32:12.68]That's huge.
[32:15.58]Enter into battle with greatly increased health, attack power, and tension.
[32:21.23]Significantly increased health, attack power, and tension.
[32:23.31]Alright, so this is the big one of these three.
[32:27.25]I feel like I don't want to spend all this money.
[32:30.93]Just try it out and see what happens.
[32:32.53]Chef's choice.
[32:34.87]Enemy's more easily stunned.
[32:37.22]Alright, let's... It's the tutorial boss, right?
[32:41.48]I'm going to just take... I'll bring some of the health.
[32:44.82]Health and power.
[32:47.32]Three, two.
[32:51.64]I can only buy one?
[32:54.59]Wait, can I only buy it once?
[32:56.11]Oh shit, I can only buy... When I buy one thing, I get it out of the menu.
[32:59.61]Alright, well, whatever.
[33:01.53]This is... Oh, no, no, no.
[33:02.26]We're good.
[33:02.54]Alright, well, no.
[33:03.84]I'm not gonna... Let's go.
[33:05.28]I'm gonna kick the guy.
[33:06.24]I'm gonna kick their ass.
[33:10.40]Did I save it?
[33:11.04]Probably not.
[33:12.94]No, don't save it.
[33:21.43]Let's see just how bad this is.
[33:27.30]Because I have 5,000 dolls, I don't want to spend it all.
[33:29.90]I got two heals.
[33:34.78]A crystal body from outer space.
[33:36.26]Bone.
[33:36.86]They came to take over the Earth.
[33:40.10]His right hand seems to be holding a weapon.
[33:41.54]It's actually the mutated bone of his hand.
[33:43.88]Ugh!
[33:44.56]And he's able to stretch it far out.
[33:45.84]This is where the name Bone comes from.
[33:47.50]Cool.
[33:48.44]One-on-one, he's not so tough, but watch out.
[33:50.04]His weapon attacks have plenty of range.
[33:52.02]This dude's just a goomba.
[34:00.20]Here we go!
[34:01.76]He has a switch controller.
[34:03.26]That's so... Oh, I love it.
[34:09.20]Jumping attacks, okay.
[34:11.78]Press B to attack while jumping.
[34:13.12]Normal jump attacks Y are great for showing off.
[34:16.32]Homing function will bring you right to your target, too.
[34:18.60]Alright.
[34:20.57]You want to scatter a bunch of surrounding enemies.
[34:22.09]Try unleashing a heavy jump attack.
[34:23.51]It feels so good, it's addictive.
[34:25.37]They leave you wide open, though.
[34:26.43]Okay.
[34:29.39]That is cool.
[34:29.83]Yeah, it's like a big down smash.
[34:34.09]Once an enemy attack is just about to land, use A to dodge and slow down time.
[34:38.71]That's a perfect dodge.
[34:40.17]This is your chance to beat the living shit out of your opponent or easily unleash some pro wrestling moves.
[34:45.27]Alright, cool.
[34:45.57]Let's go.
[34:48.51]Perfect dodge.
[34:53.61]Oh, you want me to... Okay, you want me to follow up with it.
[34:58.53]While pummeling enemies, you'll sometimes see a star appear above their heads.
[35:03.69]This is your chance to stun them.
[35:05.29]Right.
[35:07.11]Once stunned, an enemy can be knocked the hell out with ZR.
[35:10.57]Succeed and you'll get your power replenished as an extra added bonus.
[35:12.71]Alright, so when you're beating people up, you see a star.
[35:15.03]And you can like, boom, you can stun them.
[35:17.93]Oh no, they are stunned.
[35:18.69]Yeah.
[35:20.17]Okay, let's see what happens.
[35:22.74]So let's stun somebody.
[35:30.20]Stun?
[35:31.52]Oh, he stunned.
[35:31.90]He stunned.
[35:32.16]He stunned.
[35:32.44]He stunned.
[35:32.68]He was already stunned.
[35:38.72]Now ZR.
[35:42.74]Nice.
[35:45.50]Cool.
[35:47.18]Death Glove skill.
[35:48.86]After the beam katana in pro wrestling moves, your third set of techniques is your Death Glove skill.
[35:54.09]Start off by mastering the Death Kick skill.
[35:56.55]Hold L and use B to activate it.
[36:00.55]Warp right up to your enemy and dropkick their ass into next week.
[36:03.29]The Death Glove skills are all powerful, but they require cooldown.
[36:06.50]Okay.
[36:11.10]So... Was it L and B?
[36:17.08]Hold L?
[36:18.44]What's L?
[36:19.38]Hold L, B. Hold L, B. Oh, that's not B. Okay, wrong one.
[36:26.83]That's awesome.
[36:29.47]I was hitting Xbox B. I'm sorry.
[36:32.76]Estimate an enemy or pull off a successful killer slash and the slash reel will spin.
[36:36.98]Match up the images on the slash reel.
[36:38.28]Yeah, you get like the strawberry on the shortcake.
[36:45.60]Alright, hit 777 on the slash roll to unlock full armor mode.
[36:48.70]Press L and R whenever you like, an icon will be displayed so you don't miss it.
[36:52.54]Okay, yep.
[36:57.68]There it is.
[36:59.42]Alright, full armor mode standing by.
[37:01.54]Wait, did you actually get in the suit?
[37:07.31]That's awesome.
[37:08.53]Oh my god.
[37:09.65]ZR?
[37:13.87]Holy shit.
[37:16.53]I'm with Rose.
[37:26.16]Oh, that's an S-Rank.
[37:28.42]Okay.
[37:28.64]Alright, I'm figuring out...
[37:41.29]Okay, so that was that.
[37:42.07]Now what?
[37:45.33]Oh.
[37:45.45]What about my screen?
[37:50.34]I'm gonna save it here.
[37:55.64]This is good.
[38:03.51]I don't want to spoil it, but... Alright, well, I'm not going to read anymore after that.
[38:08.56]I'm not going to spoil it, but... That's where I stop reading.
[38:16.26]Should I buy something else?
[38:18.56]I'm going to get a couple more sushis or something.
[38:21.86]Wait, am I streaming?
[38:26.32]I am!
[38:26.72]On air?
[38:28.94]I'm live right now.
[38:30.14]What does that even mean?
[38:31.00]Why am I live at the restaurant?
[38:34.05]That's so weird.
[38:35.13]Why?
[38:35.61]Alright, let's get one more of these.
[38:42.19]And then I'll get the... Yeah, I don't want any more than that.
[38:46.82]Three heals is good.
[38:51.64]Twelve viewer Andy.
[38:55.00]That's definitely going to keep going up.
[38:56.38]I guarantee it.
[38:57.74]A bunch of eggs.
[38:58.44]Gonna be facehuggers?
[39:00.00]Probably.
[39:28.91]Oh, you're a cute little guy.
[39:30.63]Come here, little buddy.
[39:31.84]Oh, you're so good at walking, aren't you?
[39:35.98]Yes, you are.
[39:38.52]And a bite in the face.
[39:43.24]Let me pick you up, little guy.
[39:45.56]Oh, my God.
[39:48.16]What?
[39:59.05]Uh, where am I?
[40:01.75]This is my planet.
[40:03.47]Well, now it's a hellscape of nothing but a graveyard and a galactic waste disposal site.
[40:08.14]Titan was like most planets.
[40:11.70]This is where we grew up.
[40:13.68]My boss, Foo, he went bad shit crazy.
[40:17.23]Destroyed the whole planet.
[40:18.71]Ain't that a bitch?
[40:22.24]It is indeed.
[40:23.74]So why not get revenge?
[40:25.50]Revenge against Fu?
[40:27.22]We wouldn't last three damn seconds against him!
[40:30.97]Are you okay with a life of submission?
[40:34.41]Well, that's how I've lived.
[40:36.33]It's my destiny.
[40:38.57]Rethink this.
[40:39.83]You can still go back.
[40:42.12]Go on back to space.
[40:44.06]Well, okay.
[40:45.10]Well shit, okay, I'm fighting in- He disappears?
[41:09.88]Okay, he's got like a lightning move.
[41:11.36]He's got a hand that comes out.
[41:13.08]Alright, he's got a hand that comes out.
[41:14.24]Let's see if I can first try the tutorial boss.
[41:17.14]Alright, he goes back away.
[41:20.41]Run.
[41:25.63]That's fine.
[41:26.05]I'm just trying to see what he does for a move.
[41:31.49]He leaves his hand out.
[41:32.42]Alright, let's go.
[41:35.90]Okay.
[41:41.57]Leaves the hand out here.
[41:45.19]Yeah!
[41:48.13]Just like that game.
[41:49.65]Where you don't want to get greedy.
[41:52.29]What do I have for power?
[41:54.03]Alright, we good?
[42:02.54]Alright.
[42:02.94]Unless he has a phase 2, which he probably does.
[42:12.77]Yeah, by the way, I've seen the seal video.
[42:15.07]I've seen it.
[42:17.05]It's fucking hilarious.
[42:17.91]I've seen the seal video.
[42:42.00]I can stun him.
[42:42.98]How would I do a wrestling move to this guy?
[42:50.10]Ooh, there it is.
[42:53.88]What'd I get?
[42:56.88]U-Utopi coins?
[43:06.15]You don't know how hard I was laughing at that video for the last, like, yesterday into today, like, this morning.
[43:11.63]Oh, I'm out of, hold on.
[43:25.70]I want that, that seal is so cool.
[43:29.48]You would just do that to everybody.
[43:31.14]They would come over to the seal tank.
[43:33.80]I'll play, I'll play it in a second.
[43:34.96]Hold on, you'll see.
[43:38.48]I don't think I even need to dash there.
[43:39.46]Why am I dashing?
[43:43.32]Okay, that hurts.
[43:50.50]Not that bad though.
[43:51.18]I'm alright.
[44:05.41]I just saw the seal.
[44:06.21]What the fuck?
[44:07.55]It's so funny.
[44:09.99]He puts his head up over the water and just makes these weird noises.
[44:14.65]And people said it sounds like exactly to my voice or something.
[44:19.51]Which I can understand.
[44:20.41]Like that, like, hey, hey, hey.
[44:22.04]Get out of the way, get out, get out, get out.
[44:25.22]Yeah, it does.
[44:26.36]It's really weird.
[44:32.56]Why?
[44:33.14]Why would that seal make those sounds?
[44:34.90]Why is he going like, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
[44:40.94]You can't train a seal to do that.
[44:42.56]I think we're in phase two.
[44:51.29]Does he add anything?
[44:57.32]Alright.
[44:57.88]He's pretty easy.
[44:58.47]He's as easy as a Warcraft boss would be if you could run around this fast and well.
[45:03.23]And swing this fast.
[45:06.27]So, I'm not concerned about it.
[45:07.27]Okay.
[45:11.99]Now I am.
[45:15.77]Now I am concerned.
[45:16.45]Okay.
[45:16.75]So, how do I eat that thing?
[45:19.57]How do I eat that?
[45:20.31]Oh my god.
[45:20.83]Okay.
[45:21.07]How do I eat?
[45:21.51]How do I eat food?
[45:22.40]How do I eat food?
[45:22.96]How do you eat food?
[45:25.00]There it is.
[45:25.36]Alright.
[45:37.88]What's that?
[45:39.10]I got money.
[45:41.52]How do I get away from that?
[45:42.48]I have to jump over it.
[45:43.64]Shit.
[45:43.86]Okay, I get it.
[45:44.22]Jump over it.
[45:57.99]Jump!
[46:05.97]Don't fall in that!
[46:07.51]Don't fall in that!
[46:09.09]Hey!
[46:10.03]Hey!
[46:10.23]Get out of here!
[46:16.08]I don't want to fight him over here.
[46:16.90]He's got this like... How do I get him out of the puddle?
[46:18.64]Get out of the puddle.
[46:22.18]I don't want to fight you there.
[46:27.37]Oh shit.
[46:32.32]They open.
[46:32.74]There it is.
[46:33.36]Okay.
[46:41.15]Oh, I timed it wrong.
[46:41.97]Sorry.
[46:45.55]Okay.
[46:59.51]Give me a power.
[47:01.00]Nope.
[47:01.34]Oh, fuck you.
[47:04.04]Fuck.
[47:04.80]Okay, don't get greedy.
[47:05.72]He's almost dead.
[47:06.20]Don't be an idiot.
[47:07.02]It's a fucking goddamn tutorial demon.
[47:16.38]No, shit!
[47:17.08]I tried to... The camera changed.
[47:35.93]Alright, now I'm getting in.
[47:37.13]One more move and I'll jump over it and get him.
[47:42.95]Jump.
[47:45.85]Don't be an idiot.
[47:48.55]Don't touch these.
[47:58.74]Fuck!
[48:03.63]Everybody relax.
[48:04.31]It's the tutorial demon.
[48:05.29]I'll be fine.
[48:17.28]This one's easy to dodge.
[48:22.62]Just don't move around like an idiot.
[48:35.69]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[48:50.32]No!

[50:10.40]Oh no, that was phase one.
[50:17.74]What the hell is going on in this game?
[50:19.70]Should I go in this?
[50:35.92]Hey!
[50:36.78]What the fuck?
[50:41.65]Do I hit this?
[50:44.74]Um, alright.
[50:46.96]Is it pointing?
[50:49.50]It's going this way.
[50:50.54]The ball is going over here.
[50:52.04]Should I go with this one?
[50:54.68]Oh, that's Jean!
[50:55.50]Okay, Jean, you go first.
[50:56.46]Is it safe?
[51:13.13]I think so.
[51:13.51]Alright, Gene, where are we going?
[51:14.57]Gene looks like they're going this way.
[51:18.51]Alright, should I go in there?
[51:19.29]Alright, let's go.
[51:25.95]This is freaking me out.
[51:27.17]Play the seal video.
[51:28.51]Does anybody have a link?
[51:31.62]Does anybody have a link to, like, to... I'll just play the audio.
[51:34.78]I can't show it on screen.
[51:35.56]I have, like, my switches plugged in.
[51:42.49]Hey!
[51:42.99]Yeah, I'll play the audio.
[51:47.25]Here you go.
[51:48.31]It's just a seal on camera, like, with his head poking out of the water.
[51:56.70]Alright, here you go.
[51:59.56]July 4th, 1984, 1047.
[52:06.38]It's literally you, but it's not though.
[52:10.99]It's a seal.
[52:45.28]The seal died two months before you were born can you answer that I don't know I have no idea
[53:02.05]I've reincarnated?
[53:03.11]I don't know, maybe.
[53:08.26]That was my previous life?
[53:12.56]Oh shit, come on Jean, wake up.
[53:14.92]I didn't know which way to go.
[53:22.89]Well, I'm gonna say this way.
[53:25.57]Wait, does it- are they all the same?
[53:27.01]They look the same?
[53:39.02]I got it.
[53:39.30]It was right.
[53:44.57]Can I just attack him?
[53:57.39]It is such a funny video.
[54:06.24]Not there, Travis.
[54:07.42]Where is he?
[54:08.42]Where the hell are you, black hole?
[54:10.47]Calm down, Travis.
[54:12.11]Go left.
[54:13.05]Left?
[54:13.69]Thanks for the 10 community subs, uh, dretch.
[54:24.59]What the hell is going on?
[54:28.17]Oh my god!
[54:29.25]Full armor, Travis!
[54:30.52]Move!
[54:31.56]Move sights and lock on!
[54:32.96]L is boost?! !
[54:35.81]I have to lock on multi-laser hyper mega death particle cannon.
[54:40.88]Kravis' full armor is designed for impeccable mobility in space and is known as UGA-NVILIA mode.
[54:50.32]Use L to fly in the direction of your choice, move R to lock onto a target.
[54:54.80]After locking on, hit ZR to fire off your multi-lasers.
[54:58.31]This is going to take a little while to get used to.
[55:00.43]Use L for a boost.
[55:01.57]While boosting, your charge meter will deplete.
[55:03.89]Hit ZR to fire off your mega death particle cannon.
[55:07.31]Okay, so I have ZR is a laser.
[55:09.85]ZL is a mega death particle cannon.
[55:14.11]Holy shit.
[55:18.07]Okay, this is really weird.
[55:23.36]So it's just like Star Fox?
[55:24.84]I just lock on to shit and shoot?
[55:28.30]That's a dodge.
[55:29.04]How do I go up?
[55:29.66]Okay, up is just up.
[55:32.76]Can I lock on?
[55:33.28]Okay, I can lock on to the meteors.
[55:38.07]And then where's the charge of the cannon?
[55:39.39]Alright, let me try this.
[55:46.35]What am I firing at?
[55:47.75]What the hell did I just do?
[55:56.51]Oh my goodness gracious, okay, what about I don't know what the fuck is happening?
[56:02.11]Alright, I'm gonna try to shoot him in the head with the mega cannon Okay, you have to aim the cannon I get it I get it alright, that's fine
[56:21.04]Alright, now right in the head.
[56:26.46]This is so weird.
[56:27.36]How many... Alright, up in the air.
[56:32.94]Avoiding these is actually really easy.
[56:34.14]Alright, he's dead.
[56:39.60]One more time.
[57:02.38]So you have to do these gigantic... like... I can't even think... mech suit fights?
[57:10.43]After you fight the people in... on the ground?
[57:12.83]So every fight is at least two phases.
[57:15.11]That's... maybe not.
[57:16.15]Maybe that was just a cool one.
[57:17.47]That was very cool.
[57:20.51]Don't underestimate Earthlings.
[57:38.64]So this was the fall guy?
[57:39.32]Oh, that was the fall guy to collect the data on my move.
[57:41.66]I get it.
[57:42.12]Okay.
[57:42.96]Cool.
[58:11.00]See?
[58:11.34]Oh, it's because I didn't use any skills and I didn't do any throws.
[58:17.64]I was playing the game like Bloodborne.
[58:19.24]But you look, whatever.
[58:20.10]Got a fang?
[58:25.96]Moondust?
[58:27.08]Satellite fragment?
[58:27.96]Is it like a crafting system?
[58:34.98]Oh, they're back.
[58:41.57]You have managed to take downs in number 10 ranked.
[58:44.88]Yeah, the 10 ranked.
[58:45.80]Yeah, of course.
[58:46.58]And you have been recognized as number 10 in the galactic ranking.
[58:50.12]Well, they can't do a No More Heroes 4.
[58:51.74]Number 10 in what rank?
[58:53.36]Because... Rules are rules.
[58:54.82]Where do you go from that?
[58:55.72]The battle has already begun.
[58:57.80]You are in the eye of the storm.
[59:00.28]So you cannot escape or just disappear.
[59:03.83]You can only fight here.
[59:06.99]So I need to win, huh?
[59:08.77]Yes.
[59:09.98]Do I have to leave a message?
[59:10.94]That was a weird long... Okay.
[59:29.48]Let's just, like, Naxxramas up there, just hanging out.
[59:32.96]Okay, so we've got Sonic Juice sniping Lee.
[59:35.12]Yes, okay.
[60:00.27]gold Joe Black Knight direction vanishing point velvet chair girl on to gold Joe
[60:29.18]Yeah, see that was the tutorial boss.
[60:31.03]That was the, this is how you play the game.
[60:41.57]That was really, that was quite the intro.
[60:45.27]I will say very, very good intro.
[60:59.47]That was the entire game.
[61:03.67]That was the entire game on the PlayStation demo disk.
[61:07.91]I see.
[61:09.81]Dead, huh?
[61:11.82]That's kind of funny.
[61:13.66]It was that man.
[61:16.14]Somebody you know?
[61:18.16]Looks like not all humans are weaklings after all.
[61:22.52]This ought to be fun.
[61:25.32]What the hell?
[61:26.08]Just like I feel like this is one of those meetings that like kiss work.
[61:54.11]Rockstar comes in they're like talking about sales of record numbers and stuff Of course they're specialists in a wide range of Losers
[62:10.52]We're even more capable.
[62:12.72]So it's cool if I go ahead and fire these guys.
[62:16.16]Right, Damon?
[62:18.37]What's his hair?
[62:20.25]Stop this!
[62:21.53]Oh, don't worry.
[62:23.63]You're a good secretary.
[62:25.55]I'll allow you to live.
[62:28.97]Okay, that's enough for the entertainment.
[62:30.83]Time for a strategy meeting.
[62:32.79]Damon, whip out the blueprints for the fighting arena.
[62:37.05]It's here.
[62:39.48]Red Dead Redemption 2.
[62:40.14]Is that Charles?
[62:40.88]I think it is.
[62:41.32]That voice actor.
[62:43.38]It is, isn't it?
[62:43.80]Oh, that's cool.
[62:44.13]Yeah.
[63:04.32]They look like spore monsters.
[63:05.78]I feel like I'm in VRChat or something.
[63:07.56]Or it's got like an avatar.
[63:32.54]And the handsome-ass me now?
[63:34.44]We're the same.
[63:35.89]Nothing's changed.
[63:37.85]Come on, Damon.
[63:39.59]Trust me.

[63:44.73]Mr. President, you're gonna hold an emergency press conference.
[63:49.63]Let's make a joint announcement.
[63:52.13]I will not.
[63:53.33]Whatever you thugs are... Oh, okay then.
[63:57.00]I guess I've got no choice.
[64:05.73]I am just Baptiste VI, aka Foo.
[64:10.19]I'm Prince of the Baptiste System, and you can call me Lord Foo.
[64:15.72]Listen up, Earthling aliens.
[64:18.32]I'm about to conquer this planet, but simply conquering it is no fun.
[64:23.06]And there's probably gonna be some resistance.
[64:25.73]I understand you people.
[64:27.89]So I'm gonna provide you with an opportunity.
[64:31.09]We're gonna play a game.
[64:33.12]That's a bunch of like nukes.
[64:57.91]I don't know what army tossed that thing over this way, but I admire the motivation and the quick thinking.
[65:04.30]Nice move.
[65:06.00]Oh, shit.
[65:07.14]Oh, my God.
[65:09.34]What was that?
[65:10.32]Where was that?
[65:11.06]There's really got some balls.
[65:13.16]However, make no mistake.
[65:16.96]You think you can kill me with those primitive firecrackers?
[65:21.19]You want to kill me?
[65:23.03]Come kill me.
[65:24.91]You'll have ten of the most elite dudes in the galaxy awaiting you.
[65:29.09]Well, one of them got killed.
[65:32.23]So nine, I guess.
[65:33.80]Take us all out, and we'll go home.
[65:37.08]Otherwise, we take over.
[65:39.50]Elite.
[65:41.32]Alright, Mr. President.
[65:47.88]The game of death begins.
[65:54.80]Holy shit.
[65:55.00]It's an amusement park?
[65:56.18]This is like Disney World.
[65:57.84]Do they think they're in like a capital city?
[66:17.35]Fu and nine of his aliens are dispatched into formation.
[66:21.58]Prepare to destroy the planet any time.
[66:24.72]Five on Earth, two in the sky, one on the moon, one in space.

[68:32.09]Goddamn superhero.
[68:40.68]I wonder if this game was supposed to just be goddamn superhero.
[68:44.77]But they just made it No More Heroes 3.
[68:46.23]Because they were like, why the hell not?
[68:47.83]This is a No More Heroes game.
[68:49.51]No more than 10 hours of gaming per day.
[68:54.85]Nine more hours of gaming a day?
[68:56.46]It has been an hour.
[69:03.50]It's actually been one hour.
[69:04.70]Because they said 10, right?
[69:09.37]This is weird.
[69:19.17]Does it actually know?
[69:19.93]Alright, I got to get, I want a first impression.
[69:29.73]The first like hour of the game.
[69:30.84]It's been a lot of cut scenes and stuff and some actions too, but I mean,
[69:36.96]This is 9.4.
[69:39.00]First like hour.
[69:40.46]I love it.
[69:40.82]We'll see.
[69:42.24]It's like Netflix.
[69:43.65]What the fuck is going on?
[69:46.05]I'm looking forward to Gold Joe's voice.
[70:07.27]Old Prospector, I think so.
[70:09.61]I think it, I think.
[70:20.44]Lord Fu, Gold Joe is back.
[70:25.50]I love Gold Joe already.
[70:27.36]I'm leaving him to you.
[70:30.22]I'm honored.
[70:32.48]All the credit shall go to you, of course.
[70:37.45]What's that?
[70:38.31]It was dug out of a nebula behind the Milky Way.
[70:41.65]It's Galactica rolling thunder rainbow.
[70:46.74]Claptrap.
[70:47.40]It's got a nice shine to it.
[70:49.42]I'll take good care of it.
[70:51.04]It'll give you great power.
[70:52.96]Claptrap's glow up.
[70:54.64]I'll go destroy that earthling myself.
[70:58.02]He's much weaker than you, but be careful.
[71:01.32]He's a wily bastard.
[71:04.73]You have nothing to worry about.
[71:07.35]I want, I want Gold Joe to be my friend.
[71:10.20]I don't want to like heart kill Gold Joe.
[71:13.00]That's another title card.
[71:14.36]What is going on?
[71:39.55]is happening this is supposed to be a TV show that's so funny like we're just sitting here binging a television show we're playing a game
[72:06.66]So, what do you think about Miike's latest production?
[72:09.92]The Girls series was a proving ground.
[72:12.62]Miike used it to help him get to the next stage.
[72:15.72]It's like a treasure chest of production.
[72:18.42]By preparing so many different stages to test out just how far Japanese CG technology can go, he's pouring his passion into the improvement of systematized techniques.
[72:29.96]Damn, Travis.
[72:31.56]You really hit the nail on the head.
[72:33.70]The incubator of the new idol chosen in the audition, that's just as transient for him.
[72:38.60]And nobody notices that the true awesomeness of Miike is in the fact that he used this film shoot as a way to further his own technical staff.
[72:46.43]So basically, in the next Yakuza apocalypse-style full-on Miike film, these systematized techniques are really gonna come alive, right?
[72:55.12]Miike's a greedy dude.
[72:57.52]A hella greedy dude, that Takashi Miike, man.
[73:03.54]Who is that?
[73:05.17]Who am I talking to?
[73:06.13]Alright.
[73:06.35]Here we are.
[73:06.87]Save.
[73:07.15]Oh, it's Bishop.
[73:08.55]Okay.
[73:08.75]Huh.
[73:44.22]Teacher noise it really is Okay, what about can I can I still play with Jean?
[74:05.82]I guess I... Can I do anything else?
[74:07.02]Why do I have clothes?
[74:20.45]Access the wardrobe in the motel to swap t-shirts and change up your outfit.
[74:24.15]The only changes are aesthetic, but sometimes changing your look for a new gaming session can help you feel nice and refreshed.
[74:30.88]Get your hands on all kinds of new costumes by talking to the t-shirt aliens on the map and progress through the game.
[74:40.43]Jack it off.
[74:44.01]No, I don't want that one.
[74:46.89]I mean, it's... I want this one.
[74:50.40]Jack it off.
[74:54.06]Yeah, just t-shirt, Travis.
[74:58.48]Oh, yeah.
[74:59.14]I like the t-shirt.
[75:02.73]T-shirt with jacket off.
[75:16.70]No more heroes.
[75:17.62]Known pleasures.
[75:18.50]What color should I do?
[75:21.18]I like the blue.
[75:21.70]Palm trees?
[75:24.42]I like the palm trees.
[75:26.46]Do you even understand?
[75:30.91]This is literally Starr's t-shirt.
[75:33.39]Starr.
[75:33.81]Holy shit.
[75:40.35]Bad service, good coffee.
[75:42.01]Devolver old school.
[75:43.17]Devolver Digital?
[75:44.01]Should I put on this, just put on Starr's shirt?
[75:53.11]I kind of just, alright, we'll come back, but I kind of want this.
[75:56.91]That's funny.
[76:04.99]He's picked up the merch.
[76:23.03]Sup, Assassin?
[76:24.67]You the one who killed my buddy?
[76:27.33]I saw you on TV, Prince.
[76:30.23]What a lame-ass little speech.
[76:32.59]That shit was just stupid.
[76:34.97]We had our own Miike night over here.
[76:37.55]Thanks to that, I came to the conclusion that Andromedia deserves to be re-evaluated.
[76:42.92]Unlock the Glue Man shit.
[76:44.06]Keep talking all you want.
[76:46.44]You're already dead.
[76:47.48]Or close enough anyway.
[76:50.12]Because you've pissed me off.
[76:54.11]When the conversation stops...
[76:56.81]That's when you die.
[76:58.91]Oh, so you're challenging me, huh?
[77:01.45]You talk a pretty big game, Prince Dumbass.
[77:04.31]You, a human, ridicule me?
[77:07.90]That shall not stand.
[77:09.66]I don't have to fight him, do I?
[77:10.64]I'm tired of all this ranking bullshit.
[77:13.66]All I gotta do is take Prince Dumbass's head off and it's over.
[77:17.80]Bring it on.
[77:18.88]I'll give you a little kiss.
[77:21.18]This is over.
[77:23.34]I'll show you how it ends.
[77:29.08]What?
[77:30.60]What the fuck?
[77:37.63]Hey, what?
[77:41.07]His head's cut in half.
[78:18.65]fucking punk who's this that's about enough from you now it's my turn
[78:44.36]Oh, he's from... He's from Travis Strikes Again.
[78:46.20]Okay.
[78:46.52]Well... Ooh.
[79:17.94]Now you're really fucked.
[79:19.90]You goddamn scumbag.
[79:25.12]Now we're even.
[79:25.92]Oh, no, we're not.
[79:27.84]I'm going to kill you.
[79:29.20]You literally just, like, ripped off my friend's arm.
[79:31.34]Come see me, and I'll give you a little kiss.
[79:34.60]Son of a bitch.
[79:38.40]That's what I like to see.
[79:40.44]Don't forget, you're a scumbag, too.
[79:43.16]Clipping.
[79:43.48]Nice clipping with the cape.
[79:44.48]Ruined my fucking immersion during the game.
[79:45.57]You're not getting away.
[79:46.67]And she...
[79:49.16]What does it break?
[79:55.67]He broke it.
[79:58.91]Well, that was interesting.
[80:18.27]Baseball girl.
[80:19.35]Oh, okay.
[80:32.20]I get it.
[80:32.48]I understand.
[80:40.65]Looks like Johnny Knoxville now.
[80:42.93]Morning?
[80:45.24]Shit.
[80:47.22]Where is he?
[80:49.08]Oh, man.
[80:51.21]Shinobu.
[80:56.99]He's based on Johnny Knoxville?
[80:59.03]That's the intention?
[80:59.95]Yeah.
[81:02.13]He did a good job.
[81:03.65]What about pole?
[81:04.77]What do I do with the pole?
[81:05.71]Okay.
[81:14.14]Okay.
[81:20.39]Where's Jean?
[81:30.25]If animals could talk, it would be really weird, wouldn't it?
[81:34.53]It would make a lot of things really awkward, I think.
[81:46.40]I met you like you just sit on the couch like if Otto was sitting next to me and It's just like oh man.
[81:54.08]This is so comfortable.
[81:55.08]I feel so good right now.
[81:58.22]Oh This feels so good.
[81:59.38]I'm just so happy right now.
[82:00.66]This is awesome dude, bro.
[82:01.94]This is the best ever Mmm like you mentioned just sitting this talking like did I'm hungry.
[82:08.37]I'm so hungry man.
[82:09.39]I'm starving man.
[82:10.15]I'm hungry Can I get some food?
[82:11.05]Let's get some food man.
[82:11.77]I'm starving can have some food man.
[82:13.11]Oh
[82:15.36]It'd be really, like, weird.
[82:17.00]I feel- I feel like it- Because we- we- we turn animals, for some reason, in our heads into babies.
[82:24.18]Like, oh, it's Mr. Otto.
[82:25.78]It's little Otto.
[82:26.90]Oh, he's, like, two.
[82:29.36]He's like, hey, uh, I'm hungry, dude.
[82:33.07]You take me outside, I'm gonna go shit in your backyard.
[82:35.07]And it's like, oh, Otto's two years old.
[82:37.57]He's a little- he's a little boy.
[82:41.41]We treat animals like they're, like, little babies, like, forever.
[82:51.26]That's a Simpsons joke?
[82:52.74]That's an every person joke, okay?
[82:55.98]That's such an easy joke.
[82:56.90]I'm not even making a joke.
[82:57.64]I'm just saying, like, it's weird.
[82:59.12]Why can't I make a reference to something being weird?
[83:02.90]Why can't I make a reference to something being weird without it being on The Simpsons?
[83:05.94]I don't care if it was on the fucking Simpsons.
[83:09.78]Can I go- How do I go up?
[83:18.06]Can I do anything else in here?
[83:22.51]I can't sneeze?
[83:23.23]Yeah, I was thinking about saying that, but I feel like people would have been pissed.
[83:26.85]What is this?
[83:28.33]Capsule toys?
[83:30.35]Do I have any?
[83:31.53]I thought I did.
[83:34.65]God damn it, this collectible.
[83:35.71]Sorry.
[83:35.87]Can I play anything on here?
[83:39.83]No.
[83:51.64]Nice run.
[83:54.28]The -2 storm would have been nasty.
[83:56.22]It would have been.
[84:01.59]That's like a Simpsons joke.
[84:04.07]Aim for the circle and throw the moving ball.
[84:05.95]There's A to throw.
[84:08.28]If the ball enters the circle, Gene will shoot it back.
[84:10.84]The more you succeed, the smaller the circle will get.
[84:12.48]So be careful not to lose concentration.
[84:15.38]Okay.
[84:18.99]So aim it into the circle?
[84:21.31]Oh, this is weird.
[84:22.91]It's... It's... I'm not doing that.
[84:26.90]It's just spinning around.
[84:27.74]How do I get it over there?
[84:30.16]Oh, shit.
[84:30.74]I get it.
[84:31.08]Okay, I thought the ball was already on the ground.
[84:33.80]I thought the ball was already on the ground.
[84:35.48]I thought I was rolling it.
[84:37.26]Fuck.
[84:47.72]You suck.
[84:48.54]Come on.
[84:49.36]What's the matter?
[84:50.20]See, I don't want animals to talk because I don't want to have Otto tell me I'm shitty at throwing a ball.
[85:00.59]There it is.
[85:06.41]What's up, huh?
[85:08.02]I get it.
[85:08.28]Come on.
[85:13.32]What's the matter?
[85:16.70]No, that's it.
[85:17.78]Can I do it again?
[85:18.26]It's fun.
[85:19.00]Do it again.
[85:20.97]Alright.
[85:21.77]I gotta... You know what I mean.
[85:25.59]Whatever.
[85:26.27]Now that I understand how the game works.
[85:46.00]He's avoiding chores.
[85:46.98]No, I'm not.
[85:49.94]I can't wait to do the chores.
[85:51.04]That's my favorite part.
[85:55.32]Alright, hold on.
[85:59.45]Yep.
[86:00.75]I gotta get to at least 10.
[86:02.73]10 to 20.
[86:03.05]I'll be happy.
[86:13.47]I got three lives.
[86:16.24]That's in there.
[86:17.66]Yep.
[86:21.60]Whoa, that was bait.
[86:22.56]You see that?
[86:23.00]It didn't go.
[86:23.48]It didn't move.
[86:25.92]It didn't move.
[86:26.78]It spun in a circle.
[86:27.50]Alright, I can't.
[86:27.98]Alright, I get it.
[86:28.50]I get it.
[86:37.45]Oh my god.
[86:38.19]That's so hard.
[86:41.19]50?
[86:41.27]I don't think I can get 50, man.
[86:51.79]Jesus.
[86:53.37]No.
[87:00.69]Got it.
[87:02.12]Oh, it's so hard.
[87:03.58]I have to do it one more time.
[87:05.00]Please.
[87:05.74]Let me do it one more time.
[87:08.88]One more time.
[87:11.02]That's it.
[87:11.34]I swear to God.
[87:11.74]I promise.
[87:12.02]I gotta get to 20.
[87:28.25]Or 25.
[87:28.95]25 is a better number.
[87:31.21]This chat is full of instant gratification zoomers.
[87:35.37]Wait, why do you say that?
[87:36.33]Oh, because I'm playing a minigame for more than five minutes?
[87:44.75]Instant gratification zoomers.
[87:56.81]I mean, here's the thing.
[87:59.15]People talk about it, and, you know, you've heard me say before, like, oh, zoomers, well, like, it's not a TikTok video, it's not a Vine, yeah, it's more than five seconds, right?
[88:08.21]But this is also the same generation that will binge watch an entire series of an anime in three days.
[88:14.51]That's, that's attention.
[88:17.47]That's a lot of attention span.
[88:20.73]So, I don't know if I buy the, like, zoomers don't have an attention span anymore.
[88:32.57]but that's instant gratification.
[88:34.16]I guess you could say that, right?
[88:35.08]Fuck, that's actually hard to do.
[88:37.84]It's like, you can load up the next episode immediately.
[88:43.82]Come on, bring it.
[88:46.18]Yeah!
[88:51.68]Oh my god.
[88:52.28]Alright, alright.
[88:55.64]My previous high score is gonna beat that.
[89:00.56]Come on, what's the matter?
[89:02.84]You telling me you never zone out and be a couch potato?
[89:04.79]Oh no, all the time, yeah.
[89:06.31]But I was giving a reason as to why I didn't believe the attention span thing that I hear.
[89:16.35]You have to sit there for a long time.
[89:20.15]That's in, that's in, that's in, that's in!
[89:22.67]It's alright, whatever.
[89:24.87]That's really difficult and I will be stuck there for at least like two or three hours later.
[89:32.86]You probably get something for doing at least 20.
[89:37.20]I love that.
[89:38.36]I can't wait to do that again.
[89:40.46]But for now, it's time to... What is the time to do?
[89:48.64]It's not a worse noise.
[89:49.58]I do that all the time.
[89:53.19]Downstairs.
[89:53.61]Okay, yeah.
[90:04.79]I remember when I had to wait till next week for the new episode.
[90:07.47]Netflix changed things.
[90:10.05]Yeah, but it's almost like a 50-50 shot.
[90:11.65]Some series just dump the whole thing up there, don't they?
[90:14.29]Although they kind of stopped doing that.
[90:16.61]So... They started... That's become a thing again.
[90:21.77]Where's Shinobu?
[90:24.39]She is still unconscious.
[90:26.29]But her chances of recovery are improving.
[90:29.36]She is in stable condition now.
[90:32.90]She survived.
[90:42.49]Kind of like waiting for weekly episodes.
[90:45.45]I wish it was twice a week.
[90:56.99]Seven days for me is like, uh, for like a show I'm invested in.
[91:00.27]It's just barely enough time, I think.
[91:03.27]I would prefer like a, like a two days in a row.
[91:08.03]Like a Saturday-Sunday.
[91:09.88]Like a Jerma985 schedule.
[91:16.04]I'm sorry.
[91:20.82]You only stream once a week.
[91:22.12]Yeah, I know.
[91:23.39]That's why I said one week is just barely enough time.
[91:40.01]Sylvia.
[91:41.89]Hmm, that rage.
[91:43.68]Did something happen?
[91:44.78]They got Chernobyl.
[91:46.05]I think we're actually about to enter the real game.
[91:47.85]She is a rambunctious one, too.
[91:50.39]She was drawn to the Garden of Slaughter as well.
[91:53.22]Enough talk.
[91:54.40]Now let me at those sons of bitches.
[91:56.72]Ah, the ranking battles, hmm?
[91:58.92]Is this open world?
[92:00.52]First, you have to clear a test battle.
[92:03.20]Otherwise, you cannot participate in the ranked battles.
[92:06.54]Then hurry the fuck up and make it happen.
[92:08.72]You are so serious.
[92:10.74]Was she so special to you?
[92:12.46]Now spare me your bullshit.
[92:15.35]Oh shit, okay, can I... Perfect world?
[92:23.73]Isn't that a game?
[92:25.97]You can check mails you've received via the menu screen.
[92:33.58]You'll get stuff like important info on ranking battles and my handy little tutorials.
[92:36.62]Be sure to check it out.
[92:40.66]The MMO, yeah.
[92:41.66]Alright, I've got mail.
[92:45.96]This folder contains important mail.
[92:47.83]Thank you for using the Thunder Tiger mailing service.
[92:51.63]Important mails will be automatically sent to this folder.
[92:53.91]Thunder Tiger mailing service.
[92:55.43]Okay.
[92:59.72]Congratulations on achieving rank 10 in the galactic superhero rankings.
[93:02.52]I'm about to burp.
[93:04.78]We're good.
[93:06.04]We are contacting you to inform you regarding entry conditions for the next ranking battle.
[93:11.56]After winning required numbers of the designated matches prepared by the UAA, please use an ATM to transfer the below listed amount, which covers your registration fee and general expenses.
[93:21.77]20,000 utopia coins.
[93:22.51]Okay, I need 20,000 bucks.
[93:25.27]There's also spam.
[93:28.51]This folder contains spam mail.
[93:31.07]Okay, that's gonna be some funny laugh out loud stuff there, I think.
[93:34.67]La la waiting room.
[93:38.05]It is open world.
[93:41.11]Zoom through the city on your bike.
[93:42.55]Hit ZR to accelerate and ZL to brake.
[93:46.07]Okay.
[93:47.57]Y for speed boost, B to emergency brake.
[93:52.15]And you can, uh, hit the brake to do a drift.
[93:57.41]If you lose your bike on the free map, try pressing X. You can summon your bike- I gotta pee real bad.
[94:02.52]I'll be right back.
[98:14.19]Clog the toilet.
[98:17.19]No, just get in the water.
[98:20.01]But I'll tell you, clogging the toilet at a hotel is one of the most embarrassing things you can do.
[98:26.79]If you clog your toilet in your just house or your apartment or wherever, you have just a plunger, you just easily do it on your own.
[98:34.96]But hotels don't have plungers.
[98:39.12]There's not a plunger in the room like there is an iron, which I think is a mistake.
[98:45.55]If you're gonna have an iron in every single room, there should be a plunger in the closet, too, or something.
[98:50.95]No, not the closet, because if you, you know what I mean?
[98:52.89]Like, because if I clog the toilet in a hotel room, you have to call the front desk.
[98:58.62]And you have to say, hi, I'm having a problem with my toilet device.
[99:06.48]I can send a maintenance up to have a toilet issue.
[99:11.92]And then they have to come up and they go, alright, yeah, what's up?
[99:14.04]Uh, what's up, there's a problem, there's a toilet problem.
[99:16.69]Like, how, why, it's so embarrassing to be like, I clogged the toilet.
[99:19.55]It's like, yeah, I, it's, the toilet's, uh, there's something wrong with it.
[99:29.49]Nobody wants to, I don't, I don't, I want to take care of that.
[99:31.65]I don't want somebody else to take care of that.
[99:33.41]I want to take care of that.
[99:35.58]Like, can you just hand me the plunger at the door?
[99:39.06]And, like, the cleaning team can kind of... I don't know.
[99:43.96]I don't want someone to have to deal with that.
[99:45.12]That's, like, my problem.
[99:49.34]This is why you need a bidet.
[99:56.54]Some crazy guy took a monster shit in his room.
[99:58.99]No, they're not doing that.
[100:00.69]No one is saying that.
[100:02.05]That's absurd.
[100:02.99]No one is saying that.
[100:05.67]No one's doing that.
[100:12.84]I'm ready to do a... Why would you eat Taco Bell on vacation?
[100:20.16]I love Taco Bell.
[100:22.70]And that doesn't... Excuse me.
[100:26.98]Watch the slander.
[100:28.20]Okay?
[100:28.50]Because I don't buy that anymore.
[100:30.35]That's like the joke, right?
[100:31.97]I don't buy that anymore.
[100:35.35]I've had diarrhea from far more, like, fancy businesses than I have Taco Bell.
[100:41.30]Just being honest.
[100:41.94]Alright, let's go.
[100:45.32]Get on the highway and head to perfect world.
[100:47.16]Alright, well, you can't pause me right there.
[100:54.09]All sorts of access points you gotta throw at the free map, including missions, shops, and more.
[100:57.91]Yep.
[101:00.44]Is question marks...
[101:05.86]Oh, look at this open world.
[101:10.88]It's not a No More Heroes game if it doesn't have like a incredibly ugly iPad game level open world.
[101:20.30]Oh my god!
[101:21.22]I'm fine.
[101:31.77]Should I go to the... I'm afraid to hit the nitro.
[101:35.12]Wait, there are pedestrians!
[101:47.51]Okay, what's the nitro?
[101:55.12]Okay, this is...
[101:59.38]This is really, really sloppy.
[102:02.22]What?
[102:03.36]I don't know why... How do I hit the brakes?
[102:06.86]Okay.
[102:07.55]What's the question mark?
[102:08.83]Is it a question mark?
[102:18.51]Oh, shit.
[102:18.87]It's right here.
[102:19.29]What is this?
[102:24.70]Number five, take on the defense mission.
[102:27.02]Is this okay?
[102:28.10]Eight waves.
[102:31.67]Um... I guess it's okay.
[102:36.45]Wait, does he get sucked up into the Naxxramas?
[102:52.66]Okay, let's go.
[102:54.16]One out of eight.
[103:07.67]There's the fighting.
[103:09.02]Ooh!
[103:09.60]32-hit combo.
[103:15.16]Can I keep it up?
[103:33.27]What's the stun?
[103:33.91]When they're stunned, what do I do?
[103:36.59]Certain button to, like, dash around them, right?
[103:38.84]To grab them?
[103:43.90]Oh, I got money.
[103:44.42]Nice, nice, nice.
[103:46.24]L2 and R2?
[103:52.39]Is he stunned right now, right?
[103:53.29]No, he's not.
[103:54.45]ZR is... Captain...
[104:02.69]R2 and D2.
[104:03.19]That's kind of funny.
[104:15.25]I do miss that, though.
[104:18.85]I miss the... Are you mad?
[104:22.47]That's not in this game, is it?
[104:42.10]Now that's what we call a string.
[104:54.57]What a pain.
[104:55.84]You're a joke.
[104:57.68]What a pain.
[104:58.60]Yep, I remember.
[105:17.90]Come on that was my perfect score my perfect game Well every time he says strawberry Every time he just goes strawberry.
[105:38.14]I just think it was a Kaizen jujitsu Kaizen
[105:42.20]Tuna.
[105:43.56]Don't need your thanks.
[105:45.42]Tuna, tuna.
[105:46.70]And I like hate, I hate it.
[105:48.50]I hate that.
[105:58.74]Because he's dumb.
[106:04.63]Whatever.
[106:05.03]Oh, he stunned, he stunned, he stunned.
[106:10.07]Stunning, stunning, stunning.
[106:15.68]My yearly anime, that's right.
[106:17.01]I missed?
[106:24.36]What did I miss?
[106:42.81]It's not yearly if you watch every single night before bed.
[106:48.83]Hey, all it is if you do that for like a few days or a few weeks out of a year.
[106:53.38]La la.
[106:55.76]Alright, final wave here.
[107:09.49]Ooh.
[107:25.14]I do it really good, too.
[107:26.38]I do it really well.
[107:27.84]Those of you that have seen that show dubbed, you're probably like, fuck, that's identical.
[107:31.98]It's the same.
[107:32.70]It's actors talking.
[107:45.73]That was pretty clean.
[107:47.88]That's a good B. Alright, I got an S. That's fine.
[107:49.90]Yeah.
[107:58.21]Nobody watched the dub.
[108:00.45]I did.
[108:02.61]So, somebody did.
[108:03.35]Am I loud?
[108:09.01]How's my audio?
[108:09.75]I've messed it all up since the dollhouse.
[108:15.27]When I got back, I screwed it up.
[108:16.27]Did I sound fine?
[108:17.25]Yeah.
[108:17.39]Alright, well that was just a little random mission.
[108:20.10]Cool.
[108:24.80]Can I just do these?
[108:25.48]Why not?
[108:25.86]Can you get me to buy cars in this game?
[108:35.81]I don't remember there being other cars.
[108:45.18]Well, alright, that person's gone.
[108:46.60]Uh, we got the motel.
[108:52.40]Then, no more heroes motel.
[108:53.36]What about, what's this over here?
[108:54.28]What's that?
[109:04.26]It's like a bar?
[109:15.92]What is this?
[109:16.46]Like a video store?
[109:19.08]Is this a game store?
[109:28.74]Oh, it's Bishop.
[109:29.24]Yo, Travis, you want to make some quick cash?
[109:31.70]This dude looking for Death Man trading cards came into the shop.
[109:35.95]There's 20 of them all together.
[109:37.55]Says he wants to complete his collection.
[109:38.67]He'll pay for each individual card, too.
[109:40.65]If you find any, bring them to me.
[109:43.62]I'll cut you in on the deal.
[109:44.52]He said he's full of people with problems.
[109:47.68]You can help them out in volunteer missions.
[109:50.61]Clear volunteer missions to score rewards like Utopic Coins, Junk, and Wesson.
[109:55.33]Okay.
[109:56.65]Help preserve the culture of the city.
[109:58.75]Collect the Death Man cards spread around the city and hand them over to Bishop.
[110:04.09]Sure.
[110:04.29]That's what I'm talking about.
[110:08.39]Get out there and search till your eyes bleed.
[110:09.89]Alright.
[110:27.23]Okay.
[110:29.77]There's also... I got mail.
[110:33.43]Oh my god, there's so much mail here.
[110:36.95]Important.
[110:38.43]Spam.
[110:39.57]Recommendations for you, not flicks.
[110:42.31]You got a new movie recommended for you based on your viewing history in my list.
[110:45.67]The 51st Chamber of Shaolin.
[110:48.61]This mail is sent automatically.
[110:50.02]Okay.
[110:51.90]Okay.
[110:57.52]Alright, so we got... I need to go that way, but hold on.
[111:00.33]What's this?
[111:00.63]Is there another mission right here?
[111:05.67]Ooh.
[111:08.33]Oh, it's a sushi place.
[111:12.19]Um... No, I'm saving my money for now.
[111:16.04]What is going on here?
[111:16.70]I already did this one, right?
[111:24.86]Is this another one?
[111:29.84]Wait.
[111:29.98]Hey there, how's it going?
[111:33.72]You want to help me out, buddy?
[111:34.54]I got me an idea for the ultimate ramen recipe, but I don't have enough ingredients for it.
[111:39.07]I'm going to need some scorpions.
[111:41.41]Oh, no.
[111:44.67]I'll pay you nicely for each one.
[111:45.83]Bring me all.
[111:46.89]They brought the scorpion mission back?
[111:51.57]You can find scorpions all over the city.
[111:56.33]Help catch the scorpions needed to make broth for the ultimate bowl of rum, and that's disgusting.
[112:06.67]Hey, you're a real good guy.
[112:07.98]Um, so this is not even a mission.
[112:17.28]It's just a kind of permanent collectible thing.
[112:19.28]Alright, well, I kind of want to see what the other one is.
[112:27.84]That was pretty cool.
[112:47.47]Can I go back?
[112:47.89]I want to go back.
[112:48.35]Alright, break.
[112:58.30]What's this?
[113:03.44]Something else.
[113:04.21]Alright.
[113:09.47]Hi.
[113:11.29]This is actually just a sushi place.
[113:12.67]Alright.
[113:16.17]Health.
[113:16.73]Yeah.
[113:16.99]I'll buy like... I'll buy a... It was three last time.
[113:20.03]I'm going to go with five.
[113:25.19]I love this song.
[113:25.77]I want to hear this.
[113:28.23]Sushi sandwiches.
[113:29.59]I see you're a Steve Brule enjoyer.
[113:34.57]And we're off.
[113:35.95]Gets you plus 10 chat points.
[113:37.43]Alright, let's just do them.
[113:45.58]Let's just do it, right?
[113:47.20]Make some money.
[113:57.76]I just want to see what happened.
[114:04.90]Car can't be destroyed.
[114:06.25]So is this... this is the highway?
[114:10.09]Technically it looks like it, but why... the indicator is saying to go this way.
[114:14.27]This is the highway.
[114:15.53]Weird.
[114:17.19]Um... Santa destroy perfect world.
[114:22.65]There's multiple maps?
[114:45.03]Perfect world.
[114:51.73]What are the... Hold on.
[114:52.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[114:53.23]Find a designated match to try out.
[114:57.11]What is going on?
[114:59.01]The general location of designated matches will be displayed with the circle.
[115:02.65]Once you've found a designated match, get in there and fight.
[115:07.69]Designated match?
[115:12.52]Is this a designated match?
[115:19.84]Very confused.
[115:28.35]Jesus.
[115:34.06]I think I have to find it.
[115:35.62]Oh, there it is.
[115:36.08]Alright.
[115:38.69]This is a designated match.
[115:49.37]Yes.
[115:54.75]This is weird, so... Is this replacing the minigames?
[116:00.15]We just kind of go fight stuff?
[116:03.11]Alright, hold on.
[116:05.82]Chest hole.
[116:08.24]Watch out for his ranged attacks.
[116:09.42]He sucks at close combat, though.
[116:11.10]Dodge his mines and get in close.
[116:13.70]This guy just screams, I'm an alien.
[116:15.46]I'm getting a nasty vibe from that big-ass hole in his torso.
[116:20.93]Okay.
[116:21.17]Close.
[116:25.67]Oh, there still are odd jobs.
[116:26.85]Alright.
[116:27.15]Cool.
[116:27.79]I think there's a lot in this game.
[116:31.59]I don't want to say I'm overwhelmed, but, you know, look at me.
[116:33.51]Alright.
[116:34.01]Stunned.
[116:49.43]Whoa!
[116:49.85]Oh, those are the explosives.
[116:51.83]Those are the explosives.
[116:52.81]Did we get a raid?
[116:53.43]We just raided.
[116:54.71]What happened?
[116:58.53]Did we raid?
[117:03.12]We did have a raid.
[117:06.34]Robert Ninja, thanks for the raid.
[117:07.46]That was like an hour ago.
[117:09.90]How did I not see that?
[117:10.62]That was like two hours ago.
[117:20.18]Why are you guys saying raid now?
[117:21.38]That was like a fucking hour ago.
[117:24.23]Do it!
[117:24.49]Do it!
[117:24.81]Swing!
[117:25.13]What's going on?
[117:25.63]Swing!
[117:25.97]Z!
[117:26.39]R!
[117:26.49]What happened?
[117:26.89]Alright, get in close to this guy.
[117:39.60]There's another raid?
[117:41.98]Hold on, I can't... Late Andy.
[117:56.70]Did another raid come in?
[118:01.47]My thing just messed up.
[118:12.76]You're ignoring all raids.
[118:15.52]I'm really not.
[118:20.58]I accidentally sometimes miss.
[118:24.38]But thank you, though.
[118:25.20]Welcome.
[118:25.84]Two hours ago.
[118:26.67]Welcome to the stream.
[118:27.35]The fame got to him.
[118:33.05]That was cool.
[118:48.12]Does this go away?
[118:48.96]Can I do this again?
[118:49.56]That does go away.
[118:54.69]And I get a red coin.
[118:59.67]Cool.
[119:01.09]Find a designated match to try out.
[119:05.51]Well, I want to do this one then.
[119:14.90]100k Andy streamer doesn't care about raids.
[119:17.62]Well, there's not a 100k Andy happening right now.
[119:24.19]I'll be chasing that high for the rest of my life.
[119:26.23]So, just in case you were wondering.
[119:37.56]Suda in chat.
[119:39.54]This game is amazing.
[119:42.94]I love it so far.
[119:44.74]It's high quality.
[119:48.64]The juggernaut of mass destruction.
[119:51.24]Diversity.
[119:52.56]Planet destroying freak.
[119:53.95]When his shields are up, your beam katana will be deflected.
[119:56.21]Aim for the dark fog when attacking.
[120:00.97]That oat fish looking form tells me this guy is going to be pretty tough.
[120:04.04]Watch your beam katana power while fighting him.
[120:06.58]Okay.
[120:11.44]So he puts his shield up.
[120:12.94]And then aim for the fog.
[120:13.98]Okay.
[120:20.67]Yeah, this is great.
[120:24.23]I am very, very much interested.
[120:26.68]Alright, you got that shield up.
[120:31.30]That's fine.
[120:33.40]While he's on the ground.
[120:37.52]What's on me?
[120:38.26]Is there a bomb on me?
[120:39.14]How did that happen?
[120:41.72]Gotcha it.
[120:53.87]Oh, I'm out of power.
[121:02.49]You have Rage?
[121:06.19]I don't think so.
[121:10.45]Here's the problem.
[121:10.89]When I'm really excited for a game and I've been waiting for this game for at least a few years, I can't get angry yet.
[121:17.22]No, it's going to take at least probably two or three hours for me to care about being mad at the game.
[121:22.83]Ooh, Mustang mode?
[121:24.79]What is Mustang mode?
[121:26.99]Get up, I wanna see what Mustang mode is.
[121:30.01]Stop, come on, let me see what Mustang mode is.
[121:31.84]This game sucks!
[121:49.03]Fuck, alright, these guys are kinda tricky.
[121:52.66]I don't want to die to this.
[121:56.34]Yeah, they're annoying.
[121:56.98]These guys are annoying.
[121:58.80]They fuck with me.
[122:01.44]These guys are annoying.
[122:02.08]They fuck with me.
[122:02.60]I don't like it.
[122:02.98]These guys are annoying.
[122:10.65]That sucks.
[122:14.97]Blue Sun.
[122:16.29]Thank you, Blue Sun, for the 26 community subs.
[122:28.28]I just don't want to hit the thing.
[122:34.24]Whatever.
[122:34.56]I'll go for you.
[122:35.87]I have a ton of health, too.
[122:50.26]Jesus.
[122:52.06]I'm not going to be getting an S on this one.
[123:03.15]Hey, hack it fast.
[123:03.93]Thanks for the five community subs.
[123:07.04]It's been almost a year and you have not streamed X-Men Wolverine Origins.
[123:20.04]Okay.
[123:24.89]Sorry.
[123:30.11]How is he reading the chat and also playing?
[123:33.56]That's why I lose half the fights I play.
[123:35.24]Alright, that was bad.
[123:45.09]It's alright.
[123:50.15]Don't forget about Perfect Dodge.
[123:52.15]Does Perfect Dodge count for the shield?
[123:54.03]Or, probably the mine.
[123:58.76]No, you're just bad.
[124:03.64]Whatever.
[124:07.49]Whatever.
[124:07.73]See if I give a shit.
[124:08.55]I don't care.
[124:09.77]I don't even care.
[124:10.39]Like, okay, fuck it.
[124:11.21]That's a hater.
[124:11.85]Like... I don't care about... I don't fucking care about the hater.
[124:15.43]Right?
[124:18.13]You're bad at the game.
[124:19.25]Alright.
[124:19.57]That's a hater.
[124:20.11]Fucking hater.
[124:21.05]Whatever.
[124:21.35]I thought I was just gonna... Okay.
[124:31.66]I think I'm stuck in the fence.
[124:32.58]No.
[124:32.68]Yeah, I am.
[124:37.95]On what?
[124:38.89]Alright, we're good.
[124:52.48]Hey dude, did you um, did you have Cheerios this morning?
[124:57.23]Uh... Honey Nut Cheerios.
[125:00.21]It's okay.
[125:00.47]It's a fucking hater.
[125:01.41]Like, people that, like, hate on me and shit for no reason.
[125:03.03]I don't care.
[125:03.59]Fucking... What an idiot.
[125:05.07]No, I'm not gonna let that guy piss me off.
[125:07.61]You should know, though.
[125:08.33]Like, you should know by now.
[125:09.51]But I'm not gonna let a hater fuck with me.
[125:10.75]You know what I mean?
[125:14.64]It is what it is.
[125:15.14]It's just... I'm on the internet, right?
[125:19.02]This is the worst joke.
[125:20.30]I'm sorry.
[125:32.18]Full face.
[125:34.58]He'll rush at you suddenly.
[125:36.00]When he draws his space katana, try to pull off a perfect dodge.
[125:38.20]Alright.
[125:39.97]A hundred thousand haters.
[125:41.77]Among Us guy calls out his haters.
[125:55.07]if only the joke lasted 30 more minutes you want me to I'm not going to keep that up for 30 minutes that's not worst joke 2021 come on because I'm pretending to have like way more people hate me than that actually come on that's not the worst joke of 2021 I thought it was +2 personally let's go
[126:21.55]Alright, so he has to do a perfect dodge.
[126:23.19]That's not really perfect, but I'll take it.
[126:25.31]Alright, it's like one.
[126:29.25]Let's see.
[126:31.27]One.
[126:32.39]That seemed pretty perfect to me.
[126:41.99]Alright, perfect dodge.
[126:45.28]Right before you get hit.
[126:46.10]There it is.
[126:51.93]Stunned?
[126:52.29]Nope.
[126:56.75]Now he is.
[126:59.21]What are the four pixels on the block?
[127:05.28]Yeah, I actually don't know what those are.
[127:06.68]That's a good question.
[127:18.07]I've yet to figure that out, what those are.
[127:22.99]Oh, it's item slot.
[127:23.92]Is that food?
[127:27.96]That's sushi.
[127:28.64]Okay.
[127:39.97]Alright.
[127:40.27]Finally, an S. Dead pixel?
[127:49.00]You know what's really weird about dead pixels?
[127:52.59]So, like 10 years ago, I feel like they've solved that problem.
[127:56.92]Because 10 to 15 years ago, every monitor I ever had, it was always such a tragic, awful event when you would just see the green dot appear.
[128:05.60]I have not had a dead pixel on any monitor that I've had in the last probably five years.
[128:09.11]But it used to happen all the time.
[128:15.93]What, I have to do three coins or something?
[128:19.50]Where's my bike?
[128:24.61]I remember sitting there with my fingernail out, just tapping it a hundred times.
[128:30.47]There were so many weird old wives tales how to fix a dead pixel.
[128:34.57]Get a cloth, put the cloth over the dead pixel, take a hammer, slightly tap the hammer onto the cloth onto the pixel, and then rub garlic under your armpits.
[128:52.04]None of them ever actually even did anything.
[129:05.77]Oh, it's a scorpion.
[129:06.63]How do I get it?
[129:07.05]Did I get it?
[129:14.49]It smells fruity.
[129:15.33]It reminds me of creepy crawlers.
[129:22.70]Creepy crawlers.
[129:25.30]Those weird plastic gel... They smelled, didn't they?
[129:44.32]Oh, goodness.
[129:47.00]Triple putt.
[129:49.24]Watch out for his charges when he turns invisible.
[129:51.44]If you can dodge him, then get behind him and whoop his ass.
[129:54.92]Bouncing all over the place like that, he's gonna try to hit and run me.
[129:57.66]I gotta find a way to take him down.
[130:01.03]They can turn invisible.
[130:03.87]And then wait for them to come out of invisibility.
[130:07.58]I... Alright.
[130:09.43]I will say that I really like this one so far out of the two or three of them that have been out there so far.
[130:15.61]Because it's not just guy in a suit.
[130:18.75]Almost every single enemy in the other No More Heroes games were just dudes with bats or guys in suits.
[130:32.48]There's like actual variety in the enemy types, which is really cool.
[130:38.02]Alright, let's see.
[130:38.54]What do you got?
[130:55.15]Come on.
[130:59.31]Whoa.
[131:00.17]He jumped over it.
[131:02.17]What's the Pokémon that has all the huge arms like this?
[131:13.85]Man Champ, yep.
[131:17.20]Grab him, grab him.
[131:20.78]It's not his name?
[131:34.90]What's his name?
[131:42.40]Machamp?
[131:46.24]Whatever.
[131:47.58]Man champ, ma champ.
[131:56.89]So there's a blue and a red one.
[131:58.07]The blue one's probably just optional, I assume, right?
[132:04.03]Well, I'm becoming obsessive, so I... I'm starting to become a little obsessive.
[132:10.16]I want to do them all.
[132:20.99]Although, there's a toilet over here.
[132:22.37]Hold on.
[132:24.09]I did not hit that lady.
[132:24.83]That's a lie.
[132:25.65]Fake.
[132:27.71]Didn't touch that person.
[132:28.59]They just rolled over.
[132:29.87]I don't know.
[132:31.45]What, are you trying to get money from me?
[132:32.79]What happened?
[132:33.95]Didn't touch that person.
[132:45.08]What'll it be?
[132:46.12]Um...
[132:50.55]Power.
[132:52.83]Tension.
[132:53.99]Attack power.
[132:55.13]You know what?
[132:56.75]I'll take a couple of these.
[132:59.03]I need 20k for the fight.
[133:00.82]I have five of those already.
[133:06.98]Wait, there's a stranger over here.
[133:09.52]Dead food market.
[133:10.84]Wait, who's this?
[133:17.52]Okay.
[133:46.31]Call the front desk.
[133:51.89]Use a plunger to fix the clogged toilet.
[133:53.77]First, move L, locate the clog, and the radar will change color.
[133:58.42]Keep that position.
[134:00.72]Next, shake the Joy-Con to suck out the clog.
[134:07.00]Keep... Alright, shake it!
[134:19.01]Log, where is it?
[134:22.69]Where?
[134:23.13]Get!
[134:23.87]Go!
[134:30.34]I feel like I'm gonna sneeze.
[134:35.90]I am.
[134:39.08]I couldn't hit the mute button.
[134:39.95]I know I tried to do that, but I couldn't.
[134:42.80]That was like somebody punched me in the stomach in a beat-em-up game.
[134:46.32]That was a beat-em-up game henchmen die sound.
[134:52.19]That was like... Good work.
[134:59.37]Seeing you work so hard has truly moved me.
[135:03.03]Take this.
[135:04.48]And a movie flyer.
[135:05.28]It's a golden axe death scream.
[135:08.44]That's what I'm saying, yeah.
[135:12.56]Okay, so I did that.
[135:15.12]Is there anything I can do now besides that?
[135:20.94]Now I can save it.
[135:32.03]That sound made my dog start barking.
[135:39.66]Log it again.
[135:45.12]I got mail.
[135:45.68]Let's look at the mail.
[135:49.90]There's more tutorials.
[135:51.20]There's something here, though.
[135:55.72]What is this?
[135:57.94]Number 12, take on the defense mission.
[135:59.80]Is this okay?
[136:00.44]Two waves.
[136:00.92]Yeah, sure.
[136:01.32]Let's do it.
[136:05.76]You gonna play this game all night?
[136:06.90]I'll be playing this game for the next two days.
[136:10.07]Oh, yes.
[136:13.31]Start the game!
[136:16.04]That's two waves.
[136:21.54]Let's get a perfect, right?
[136:24.32]7-7 now.
[136:45.50]Oh, you think about it.
[136:49.94]Double.
[136:54.08]Oh, I did get a double.
[136:54.64]Nice.
[136:54.86]Okay, cool.
[136:55.08]Where are they?
[137:01.76]Whoa.
[137:02.32]Alright, let me get no hit.
[137:04.61]Perfect.
[137:04.87]Let me get a perfect.
[137:05.65]There it is.
[137:22.50]Throw crazy mode?
[137:23.26]What's that?
[137:23.58]Throw crazy mode.
[137:24.24]What's that mean?
[137:26.26]Oh shit, I can just... Okay, cool.
[137:27.52]I get it.
[137:31.50]That was perfect.
[137:42.73]One minute.
[137:43.71]S. Nice.
[137:52.91]Highest is SS.
[137:57.45]Boring dude, just unclog into the toilet already.
[137:59.29]Alright.
[138:06.04]I'm guessing you just can do that over and over again for money.
[138:08.56]Just in case I don't have enough.
[138:10.92]Where's my bike?
[138:19.53]So what?
[138:20.23]There's like the sushi place.
[138:24.88]It is the toilet repair thing.
[138:32.21]Is there... There's something else on the map.
[138:41.59]Back?
[138:43.92]Oh, shit.
[138:44.42]Okay.
[138:44.82]What is this?
[138:50.30]I am here to propagate fashion.
[138:52.66]You show promise.
[138:53.46]I will make you more stylish.
[138:56.52]Friendly aliens can be found throughout town.
[138:58.22]There's some really nice dudes who will hook you up with some cool t-shirts.
[139:02.10]Each time you fulfill certain conditions, you'll be able to score new t-shirts.
[139:06.94]Buy a total of over 5,000 bucks.
[139:09.28]And I get the Carl CS shirt.
[139:16.63]You do not meet the requirements?
[139:18.11]How?
[139:18.99]Oh, wrong money.
[139:22.98]It's two different currencies.
[139:29.79]Whatever.
[139:33.17]There's, like, gold and then there's Clash of Clans gems.
[139:45.87]Got it.
[139:50.96]I'm going to do the last fight mission.
[139:53.24]Where was it?
[139:53.60]It was down here, right?
[139:58.70]Where was that mission?
[140:05.42]It's not this way.
[140:06.08]Maybe it is that way.
[140:17.20]Come on.
[140:18.52]Is there a map?
[140:20.86]Map minus?
[140:22.74]Alright, where is it?
[140:23.42]Oh, it's all the way down here.
[140:25.06]Okay.
[140:25.40]Looks like the tip.
[140:31.87]I fucking can't even.
[140:44.59]Oh, you can zoom in and zoom out?
[140:46.17]That's good to know.
[140:54.35]T-shirt.
[140:56.65]And something else.
[140:57.37]What is that?
[140:58.91]So many things to look at in this one.
[141:00.25]This looks like the level from Hitman 2.
[141:08.26]This exact street is just that neighborhood.
[141:11.58]Like the mafia boss is in his house in the suburbs.
[141:19.03]Isn't it just terrible?
[141:19.75]One cannot even play catch with all this grass.
[141:22.55]I'd like to test out your true fortitude.
[141:24.05]Could you please clean up all this grass?
[141:26.39]As a show of respect for your whimsically good heart, I shall reward you handsomely.
[141:31.46]Lawn mowing.
[141:36.66]We go now?
[141:40.43]Oh, lawn mowing's back.
[141:41.45]Mow all the grass before time runs out.
[141:43.83]The lawnmower moves forward automatically.
[141:46.30]Press R to dash.
[141:47.60]Move the lawnmower back with ZL.
[141:49.70]During moving backward, press ZR to return forward.
[141:54.44]Press B to change.
[141:55.54]Alright, whatever.
[142:13.74]That's just, that's, that's the way you just do it when you, you're pissed off.
[142:20.26]Dad's like, knock, knock, knock, knock.
[142:21.68]Hey, I thought you were gonna mow the lawn this weekend.
[142:27.92]I was, but fuck, I can't.
[142:30.47]Hey, you're supposed to be mowing the lawn right now.
[142:33.61]Give me a hand out here, man.
[142:35.59]Oh, fine, just fucking do it quick, I don't fucking give a shit.
[142:42.50]I have five minutes to do this.
[142:54.79]Oh, my God.
[142:55.17]Well, that's so me.
[143:02.93]Turn, turn, turn, turn.
[143:06.11]I got to get this last piece.
[143:10.77]He's so relatable.
[143:16.11]Oh my god, such a relatable thing to say.
[143:25.11]I got a gold rank.
[143:27.03]What's that worth?
[143:27.53]You have grasped the basics.
[143:33.04]Next is the real thing.
[143:34.06]Prepare yourself appropriately.
[143:35.40]Okay.
[143:42.25]Next is the real thing.
[143:44.33]New level is unlocked.
[143:47.32]I want to do it.
[143:50.52]Level one volunteer mission.
[143:51.78]Yes.
[143:56.17]Oh, this is where it becomes real.
[143:57.61]Okay.
[143:58.43]Alright.
[143:59.25]No messing around here.
[144:19.25]Alright, whatever.
[144:28.01]E and turn makes you turn sharper.
[144:29.33]Okay, let's do that.
[144:30.09]I wish the camera moved with you.
[144:44.37]This actually was a better tactic.
[144:58.39]How is that a better tactic?
[144:59.17]Alright, now let's clean the rest up and I'll be good.
[145:16.24]Back it up.
[145:22.07]Inefficient Andy.
[145:23.73]Doesn't need to be efficient, just need to get done fast.
[145:43.75]Silver.
[145:54.32]Those controls are weird.
[145:55.04]I think this is reward.
[145:58.74]Alright, now I've got 5,000 Wesson now.
[146:03.10]I can get the shirt.
[146:04.32]Is there another level?
[146:08.63]Little two.
[146:08.97]Everything's fine.
[146:12.74]Let you know if anything comes up.
[146:13.58]Alright.
[146:17.30]Getting it done fast is what efficiency is.
[146:27.42]Well, but wouldn't efficiency... You can be really fast and do a terrible job.
[146:34.30]That's not efficient.
[146:36.08]If you go so fast that you fuck the whole thing up, you're just doing it as you're rushing.
[146:40.09]That's not efficient if it's bad.
[146:43.39]Efficient is fast and well.
[146:45.11]Exactly.
[146:52.19]Just because you sprint 100 miles per hour and go really fast does not mean you did a good job.
[146:55.80]That means that's inefficient.
[147:00.34]You're bad at both, though.
[147:01.36]That's fine.
[147:05.66]Don't listen to the haters.
[147:06.78]Yeah, I know.
[147:09.55]What the fuck?
[147:10.11]There's a bunch of haters.
[147:12.93]If one of his shots hits you, it'll screw up your death glove.
[147:15.73]If he gets you in his sights, dodge.
[147:19.03]He's small, but definitely tough.
[147:20.03]This could be a hassle.
[147:21.63]That name, though.
[147:22.99]Leopardin.
[147:23.74]It's pretty badass.
[147:27.42]Okay, so be careful.
[147:29.58]Just be careful.
[147:34.11]This guy's the boss.
[147:45.93]Alright, he's got like a cube.
[147:47.71]Ow.
[147:50.14]Alright, let's go for a dodge.
[148:04.03]Nice.
[148:04.41]You know, I kind of like... Is this how the game is?
[148:09.11]I actually kind of prefer it like this.
[148:20.31]Shit, I'm out of battery.
[148:20.91]Come on, give me a break.
[148:28.49]Oh, what does it shoot?
[148:29.29]What does it shoot?
[148:38.23]That's a stun!
[148:39.36]That's not... Alright, I can... I got that one down.
[148:51.30]Throw it.
[148:51.58]Battery Andy?
[149:09.42]I'm not... You know what I'm saying?
[149:11.99]I haven't took any.
[149:18.29]Shit.
[149:18.61]I just did.
[149:24.89]Oh, there's no iframes.
[149:25.77]Don't act like there's iframes, Jeremy.
[149:27.14]Oh.
[149:39.85]Ooh, that's good.
[149:41.23]Ah, battery anti, god damn it.
[149:49.05]Fuck, that hurts.
[150:00.76]What hit me?
[150:03.50]Alright, that was cool.
[150:15.63]I think that was pretty clean.
[150:16.65]I'll take an A. What?
[150:22.61]I thought that was pretty clean.
[150:23.51]You have to kick more for the high score.
[150:36.93]Yeah, I just keep forgetting I have it.
[150:42.71]So that's that.
[150:44.07]Now what?
[150:46.83]We've cleared all the designated matches needed to enter the ranking battles.
[150:49.49]What we need to do next is get to an ATM and transfer the funds for the tournament entry fee.
[150:55.04]ATMs are shown on the map with an icon that looks... I don't even know what that is.
[150:59.78]Is it like a house?
[151:02.24]Is it like a bank?
[151:04.92]It's a really weird icon.
[151:06.83]Does it say ATM?
[151:08.01]ATM?
[151:13.08]Oh, okay.
[151:13.52]I thought it was like a city.
[151:15.76]You can check out the coordinates on the map.
[151:21.01]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[151:23.41]You can check out the conditions required to enter ranking battles via mail in the menu.
[151:28.71]Be sure to read them carefully.
[151:30.03]Aye, aye, aye.
[151:38.18]New mail.
[151:38.56]I wanted to go to the mail.
[151:45.78]How do I get to the mail?
[151:46.44]What the hell?
[151:47.78]Pause.
[151:48.96]This isn't mail.
[151:52.52]System.
[151:53.39]Records.
[151:53.95]Oh, mail.
[151:54.35]There it is.
[151:57.25]Alright, $20,000 at an ATM.
[151:58.17]Let's go.
[152:02.47]This dude is smoking garlic heroin.
[152:08.08]But there's t-shirts over there.
[152:09.16]And there's something else.
[152:11.54]Can't get it by cars.
[152:14.06]What is this?
[152:19.22]What is that?
[152:19.68]It's a marker?
[152:30.03]I put a marker down?
[152:32.68]Oh, I didn't even know I did that.
[152:33.58]Wait, t-shirt!
[152:47.58]I'm here to give you fashion.
[152:51.24]Use death skills a total of 25 times.
[152:54.10]I don't think I've done it.
[152:54.84]I have not done it 25 times.
[152:55.78]Fine.
[152:55.96]Give me the ATM.
[153:25.78]How much garlic oil do you smoke?
[153:28.78]That's a nice watchdog's framerate.
[153:33.67]Yeah, it is a nice watchdog's framerate.
[153:35.79]Here's the difference.
[153:37.33]This game stays on.
[153:38.31]That's steep, man.
[153:46.98]Yeah!
[153:54.84]And this is actually fun.
[153:56.79]For a second, I thought it crashed.
[153:58.29]I was about to laugh.
[154:00.95]The gold family has served the royal family for about 23,700 years now.
[154:06.41]It has been pretty long.
[154:08.95]This is apparently a specialty of this planet.
[154:11.83]These humans line up for more than two hours for this shit.
[154:16.79]And you got some just for me?
[154:20.14]I had Damon's secretary line up for it.
[154:22.00]Long line.
[154:29.51]Are they drinking boba?
[154:32.30]How nice.
[154:50.49]Didn't he like nuke like 600 million people in the beginning of the game?
[155:33.00]Damn.
[155:33.42]Okay, we gotta clean up here.
[155:34.38]A lot of pizza.
[155:37.69]Okay, here we go.
[155:38.29]Rank matches.
[155:39.65]Access this entrance and you'll be thrown into a series of life or death battles against the other rankers.
[155:44.19]Basically, it's a bunch of boss battles.
[155:48.15]Okay.
[155:49.25]You've got toilet breaks, sushi you can buy, the power-up machine, and death glove chips.
[155:55.22]Use all these to add your advantage and be sure to prepare yourself for the deadly battles ahead.
[155:58.46]Good luck.
[156:01.06]Interesting.
[156:08.46]I'm feeding the cat a candy bar.
[156:09.68]This is weird.
[156:12.51]What was that?
[156:13.03]The cat treat, oh.
[156:36.43]Oh, bonito flakes.
[156:37.38]Alright, let's change.
[156:43.04]I want to change clothes.
[156:46.54]Is the jacket back on?
[156:47.28]Which one?
[156:58.85]Oh, I have a Mr. Black Hole shirt.
[157:01.45]I like that.
[157:07.14]Kill, kill, kill.
[157:13.39]I got the kill, kill, kill shirt.
[157:19.47]Yeah, alright.
[157:20.09]Kill, kill, kill.
[157:23.49]Jacket off.
[157:24.01]Yeah, keep the jacket off.
[157:31.57]And what else can I do?
[157:34.20]I'm about to fight...
[157:38.76]What's his name?
[157:39.26]Gold Joe?
[157:39.88]What the hell is this?
[157:48.13]Power up machine?
[157:49.19]Hey creepy ass otaku.
[157:55.61]I'll use my power up machine to enhance your skills for you.
[157:59.52]Stick in all the wesson you got.
[158:04.10]There's a power-up machine in Dr. Naomi's lab.
[158:06.27]By feeding Wesson World's End Supernova into the power-up machine, you can enhance your health, attack power, power, and cooldown time required for using skills.
[158:15.57]You can also use it to acquire new techniques.
[158:18.89]You can readjust your various status levels, so try tweaking the balance until you find your sweet spot.
[158:22.77]And don't worry, you can get back the Wesson you put in.
[158:25.70]What do I have to do?
[158:31.53]Power.
[158:32.93]How do I do this?
[158:33.59]A down?
[158:39.25]Back.
[158:39.55]Okay, this is my power.
[158:42.35]Health.
[158:44.45]Attack power.
[158:46.29]Battery power.
[158:48.71]Level 2 death skill.
[158:52.60]For dash attack.
[158:55.34]Shake that to special ties.
[158:58.40]When handheld style.
[159:00.34]Hold on, I gotta read this again.
[159:04.47]While dashing, shake allows you to special attack.
[159:11.73]Okay, so while I'm running, I shake and I can do a jumping slash.
[159:14.45]Cool.
[159:15.29]Is there anything else I can do?
[159:17.69]I probably should do health, right?
[159:19.27]That makes the most sense right now.
[159:23.31]Cool.
[159:24.48]I love this game.
[159:25.70]I love this game.
[159:27.92]This is very good.
[159:30.36]I'll do attack as well.
[159:35.73]I'm gonna do attack again.
[159:36.59]I'm gonna do attack again.
[159:40.79]Fuck, I don't have money.
[159:44.01]Power level.
[159:44.96]Definitely on the battery, Andy.
[159:46.50]I'm gonna do this twice.
[159:47.28]Yeah, I don't wanna deal with this.
[160:02.37]Alright.
[160:03.83]That looks pretty good for now.
[160:04.89]No special moves though.
[160:05.89]That's alright.
[160:11.62]That's cool.
[160:15.72]Time Machine?
[160:17.34]What is a Time Machine?
[160:20.82]It's a time machine in Dr. Naomi's lab.
[160:22.38]You can use it to have rematches against Rankers you fought in the past.
[160:26.25]Set the difficulty level higher to receive more awesome rewards for winning.
[160:32.24]So you just, it's like a boss farm?
[160:37.88]Interesting.
[160:38.76]Okay.
[160:39.34]Death glove chip?
[160:45.72]Here you can equip and create death glove chips.
[160:50.05]What do you want to do?
[160:50.89]Equip?
[160:57.23]Here's the supercomputer.
[160:59.92]Access this to create and equip Death Glove Chips, items which provide a wide range of special effects.
[161:05.42]Up to three Death Glove Chips can be equipped at once.
[161:08.76]Each chip has a strength and weakness.
[161:10.18]Find the one that best suits your needs.
[161:13.28]I don't have any chips, so let's see what we're going to create.
[161:17.46]This keeps up, this is Game of the Year.
[161:19.71]I'm going to tell you, right now.
[161:22.69]Access this to create and equip Death Glove Chips.
[161:24.41]Okay, to create a chip, you'll need junk for raw materials.
[161:29.46]and utopia coins to pay for development costs.
[161:31.58]Okay.
[161:36.14]That's the weird material I've been getting.
[161:39.30]Junk is dropped by enemies and can be received as a reward for clearing volunteer missions.
[161:43.02]Right.
[161:43.41]Like I've been doing.
[161:45.55]And junk has different rarity.
[161:46.95]The rarer the junk, the harder it is to find.
[161:48.51]Alright, so I have 500 bucks.
[161:52.01]Number one great chip.
[162:07.46]these?
[162:10.60]Wish I do.
[162:11.12]How about number 35?
[162:13.94]That's how old I am.
[162:14.72]So, Noah chip?
[162:18.48]When health is at 80% or above, damage taken is 7% down.
[162:22.62]Oh, I need three more vinyl dolls.
[162:29.64]Okay, hold on.
[162:36.13]After successful guard, power consumed, 20% down.
[162:38.19]You'll get it later.
[162:40.19]Ah, this is cool.
[162:46.62]Normal attack power, down 5%, heavy attack power, 10% up.
[162:53.08]I don't know, I kinda like that.
[162:54.26]That's 5.
[162:57.46]Start at the top.
[162:58.36]It says you take more damage, but you do more damage.
[163:10.57]The world got Psychonauts 2 and No More Heroes 3 in a week.
[163:14.35]We really do not deserve this.
[163:15.67]Should I do damage?
[163:18.23]Yeah, let's go.
[163:22.09]Mash the A button hard.
[163:24.91]Wait, I have to do it three times to get it?
[163:35.44]So I have to do this three times.
[163:36.42]No, once is enough.
[163:45.69]Oh.
[163:48.71]Oh, I have three slots!
[163:50.41]I've got three slots!
[163:51.89]Holy shit!
[163:52.95]Oh my god, that just opens up so much stuff.
[163:55.63]Okay.
[163:57.11]And I want this, too.
[163:57.97]I can do so much damage.
[164:07.31]Alright, let's do it.
[164:09.15]This is awesome.
[164:09.87]This is so cool.
[164:12.49]This is so cool.
[164:13.49]This really is.
[164:14.17]Damage taken, so I'm going to take 5% 10% more weapon attack.
[164:26.30]Alright, so right now I've got 30% heavy attack power.
[164:34.04]But I take 10% more damage and my normal attack is a little weaker.
[164:41.50]Very cool.
[164:42.12]Okay.
[164:49.07]Nice.
[164:51.83]Glass Cannon?
[164:52.71]I'll take that.
[164:55.68]Sugar Glass Andy.
[165:02.01]Hey, my dude.
[165:03.51]This is Don My Sushi.
[165:04.87]We, uh, work with Jeeber Eats.
[165:07.41]Make sure you get your sushi nice and quick.
[165:09.69]My sushi's the freshest around, even after traveling through time.
[165:11.91]Go ahead and pick some out from the menu.
[165:15.16]I have five of these already.
[165:16.44]I don't have very much money.
[165:19.84]I'll take one of these.
[165:20.74]That's really cool.
[165:33.83]What a game.
[165:35.11]Tutorial room?
[165:36.15]No, no, no, no.
[165:38.07]I don't need to do that stuff.
[165:39.26]Tutorial.
[165:39.58]What are you doing?
[165:40.14]Is there anything else I can do here?
[165:48.32]The stairs.
[165:49.46]Exit.
[165:49.98]No.
[165:51.95]Is there another room to check out in here?
[165:56.15]Over here?
[166:03.88]Oh, wait.
[166:06.23]Shinobu.
[166:09.87]I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.
[166:14.25]Can I not do anything?
[166:22.20]Oh, shit.
[166:22.90]I probably can do something later, right?
[166:32.57]Livestreaming your injured friend.
[166:34.21]Yeah, that's pretty fucked up.
[166:40.69]Alright, let's save it.
[166:41.33]And now I'm going to do the mission.
[166:42.61]Let's go for it.
[166:45.79]Old Joe.
[166:46.49]See if I can kill him.
[166:57.64]Pet cat.
[167:04.33]Bet your ass I'm gonna... Well, I'm feeding the cat a cat stick.
[167:18.98]I'll check upstairs before I do the fight.
[167:23.96]You guys remember Mega Man Legends?
[167:27.54]That chip thing in your hand reminds me of Mega Man Legends.
[167:31.77]It's like the coolest part of that whole game.
[167:39.16]Capsule toys, I don't have any.
[167:42.24]Oh, let's just go.
[167:51.02]Am I ever going to stream Mega Man Legends 2?
[167:52.92]I have it back here.
[167:55.17]So, the plan is, yeah, I just don't know when.
[167:59.37]One day.
[168:05.20]Transfer the tournament money.
[168:06.04]Time for the ranking battle.
[168:07.82]Head to the motel parking lot.
[168:10.86]Check my mail.
[168:15.28]Alright, we're good.
[168:20.66]Wait, what is this?
[168:26.28]That's not the ranking battle.
[168:27.28]What is that?
[168:31.74]Stalling.
[168:35.04]No, it's not called stalling.
[168:36.10]It's called experiencing.
[168:39.02]Wait, this is my apartment.
[168:39.94]Never mind.
[168:40.56]I am stalling.
[168:41.38]Fuck.
[168:41.74]Sorry.
[168:43.14]I thought this was somebody else's apartment.
[168:51.77]Wasn't his apartment upstairs?
[168:53.13]That's his old apartment.
[168:54.07]Wait, it's the same apartment.
[168:55.39]I have two apartments.
[168:58.67]In No More Heroes 1 and 2, you live upstairs.
[169:00.67]But whose house is this?
[169:01.49]This is not mine either.
[169:03.03]If I end up in my house, I'm going to be really upset.
[169:13.78]Oh, this is bad girl's house?
[169:15.18]How you doing?
[169:23.51]Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy.
[169:27.45]Charlotte.
[169:28.52]Watch this.
[169:28.88]It might make you feel better.
[169:30.10]I recommend spice run with while being invoked.
[169:37.98]I don't know what they're saying.
[169:41.37]There's still some hope for this world.
[169:46.97]Spice Runaway.
[169:50.11]This will prove it.
[169:54.69]Okay.
[170:01.24]Okay.
[170:09.53]Space Runaway.
[170:12.64]Well, I don't watch that much anime.
[170:14.12]And that's not even a real anime.
[170:15.12]Wait, there's another door over here.
[170:16.13]I'm not stalling, Andy.
[170:17.31]I'm experiencing the game I've been waiting for three years to play, Andy.
[170:21.53]That's what you can call me.
[170:24.57]You put in quotes.
[170:26.03]Experiencing game, been waiting three plus years to play, Andy.
[170:32.94]What is this?
[170:34.88]Watch this.
[170:40.18]Hell yeah!
[170:41.68]You got a new t-shirt.
[170:43.20]Cat.
[170:44.00]How much longer am I going to scream for?
[170:55.87]I don't know, maybe a couple hours, a few hours.
[171:07.44]I have to play at least a little bit with the kill, kill, kill shirt.
[171:13.02]Alright, let's do it.
[171:16.52]Gold Joe.
[171:22.59]Sunflowers?
[171:23.09]That's tomorrow.
[171:35.43]Big-ass phone ranked assassin is gold.
[171:37.95]Joe.
[171:38.97]He is a space or dealer He smuggles and sells hazardous ores and minerals The ores are made into weapons of mass destruction Sans voicing same is a threat to the peace and safety of the galaxy Go crazy Travis.
[171:56.02]Welcome to the garden of insanity.
[171:59.01]Oh
[172:14.06]That's a disaster
[172:23.91]I was, oh my god, that was really embarrassing.
[172:26.12]Remember the, alright, hold on, everybody slow down.
[172:29.42]Do you remember the joke from like an hour ago when I said that sneezing, wouldn't my sneezes sound like I'm a guy getting beat up in a beat-em-up game and I die?
[172:36.78]That's the die sound?
[172:38.46]I started to feel the sneeze coming on and I was like, fuck, I gotta be ready.
[172:41.82]So I was gonna go like, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, sneeze!
[172:45.75]And, but it didn't work out that way.
[172:47.21]It actually just kind of came out.
[172:48.55]I couldn't even do the first part of the joke.
[172:55.80]Hold on.
[172:56.06]Let me move this.
[173:02.67]That's... Then it's not the joke.
[173:04.99]Worst unfinished joke.
[173:09.23]You're so cringe, Jerma.
[173:10.43]No, that said never change, Jerma.
[173:13.31]I just... That was what I wanted to say.
[173:14.79]I'm mad at it for some reason.
[173:16.04]Why?
[173:16.28]Alright, what'll it be?
[173:21.20]What do I have?
[173:21.60]I've got five heals.
[173:25.63]I'm just gonna get a couple of these because it might be an opportunity to use them Fuck the haters That's my favorite of that.
[173:40.54]I love that.
[173:41.88]I love that you guys are doing that now.
[173:43.58]It's not just me
[174:07.98]Alright, I'm ready.
[174:08.42]Let's do it.
[174:10.59]Old Joe.
[174:19.89]Alright, so what's your deal?
[174:53.36]He's about to change to get into the shower.
[174:56.67]That's the move you do before the pixelation comes on.
[175:02.83]I hope you liked it.
[175:04.72]My hyper-modern artwork.
[175:07.16]I project images relevant to one another onto physical matter, making it seem as though there's a beautiful space existing right there.
[175:14.74]It's cutting-edge magic.
[175:16.06]So projection mapping, right?
[175:18.12]I'm already sick of seeing that shit.
[175:20.34]With this sort of thing, from like the second time you see it, your brain already understands what's going on.
[175:25.53]You can't not see it as fake.
[175:27.67]Oh, snap.
[175:29.37]Snap, crackle, and hippity-bop.
[175:33.73]to think that you'd be ahead of us in this sort of artwork?
[175:37.45]Also, that's way too much time wasted on something like simple projection mapping.
[175:42.47]Don't waste budget money on shit like this.
[175:46.35]Oh, snap!
[175:48.07]Snap, crackle, and pippity, poppity, pop!
[175:52.77]Criticized?
[175:55.14]And by an earthling?
[175:57.80]Well, judging by what I see, I'm assuming you use magnets, huh?
[176:02.76]Oh snap!
[176:04.48]Snap, crackle, and pippity poppity poopity pow!
[176:08.81]So you're gonna use blue and red magnetic north-south to bust out some just slightly puzzle-ish attacks, right?
[176:15.01]Damn!
[176:16.99]Snap, crackle, and got damn!
[176:21.00]Okay.
[176:21.32]What does that mean?
[176:22.54]Is it red and blue?
[176:23.00]How do I attack him when he's red and attack him when he's blue?
[176:25.92]Oh, blue.
[176:26.60]He's blue?
[176:50.72]I gotta stand on blue to hurt him?
[176:52.46]How does that work?
[176:58.52]Alright, he's red?
[177:01.96]No, he's blue.
[177:05.74]What color is he?
[177:07.65]I don't understand.
[177:08.09]I wasn't paying attention.
[177:09.37]Alright, he's blue.
[177:12.85]He's blue now.
[177:13.37]Now that means I attack.
[177:14.87]With blue, I can attack.
[177:27.21]He's gonna hit the wall, and it's gonna hit the blue, and I'm gonna get him points for it.
[177:30.85]That's not how magnets work.
[177:41.06]Alright, but... When he said the really important line, I didn't even... My brain was not processing what he was saying.
[177:51.95]I need red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red.
[177:54.41]I got red.
[177:57.85]That's a lot of damage.
[178:07.58]Spin it.
[178:14.28]Oh, dodge it again.
[178:24.66]He's blue!
[178:30.00]Blue!
[178:33.48]Stunned him!
[178:35.24]Ooh!
[178:35.96]Sorry about that!
[178:37.94]Red!
[178:54.90]My health is zero.
[179:00.58]What just happened?
[179:04.22]What happened?
[179:04.88]Oh my god.
[179:05.72]I got insta-killed.
[179:07.04]What is this?
[179:19.43]Nothing in particular.
[179:20.13]Retry.
[179:21.55]What happened?
[179:22.07]What's going on?
[179:22.69]I don't get it.
[179:26.29]I don't even know what happened.
[179:27.03]He hit me.
[179:27.59]I instantly died.
[179:28.87]Holy shit.
[179:29.79]That was crazy.
[179:30.73]Okay.
[179:32.01]Let's go.
[179:33.05]What?
[179:33.85]I'm so confused.
[179:36.39]Bloop.
[179:40.85]Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[179:55.40]No, no, red!
[179:56.11]Dumb!
[180:05.62]Red!
[180:07.18]Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red!
[180:09.40]Where's red?
[180:09.98]Am I red already?
[180:13.15]He's standing on the red.
[180:14.21]Whatever.
[180:37.18]What's he doing here?
[180:38.22]Alright, what's he going to do?
[180:44.16]No, no, don't.
[180:44.90]Don't.
[180:45.20]Idiot.
[180:46.70]No, you fucking idiot.
[181:02.38]I just hit him into the wall.
[181:09.16]Come on!
[181:20.27]What color?
[181:20.79]Red!
[181:22.47]Red!
[181:33.83]Alright, phase three.
[181:48.82]Back it up.
[181:50.86]Holy fucking shit, that was a lot of damage.
[181:54.58]Red, got it already.
[182:05.98]What do you got?
[182:08.06]Oh!
[182:15.21]I'm already blue.
[182:16.47]I'm already blue.
[182:17.85]What's he doing?
[182:20.07]Oh!
[182:25.72]Red!
[182:28.20]Red!
[182:35.95]Get over here.
[182:36.41]Oh my goodness.
[182:42.13]We don't want color, color, color, color.
[182:44.98]Color, what color?
[182:46.46]Pick one.
[182:46.78]Pick a color.
[182:50.78]Blue, got it.
[182:51.64]Alright, say goodnight.
[183:03.48]Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[183:04.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[183:07.36]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[183:15.34]I got him.
[183:21.02]I almost just died there.
[183:26.94]That was cool.
[183:27.56]I don't know if that's it.
[183:28.80]We're still in space.
[183:43.15]Old Joe is dead.
[183:44.09]Oh, I guess not.
[183:45.29]I guess he's just dead.
[183:48.50]No, Adam Sandler noises.
[183:49.74]I'm going to do those when I get into a situation where I'm scared.
[183:55.36]Is this the shit you've been smuggling?
[183:57.38]Wow, you're a real shitty guy, huh?
[184:00.34]Um, you probably shouldn't touch that stuff.
[184:03.16]It's super dangerous.
[184:04.94]It'll melt stuff like everything.
[184:08.51]That's why it makes such good money.
[184:13.27]Alright, then.
[184:14.49]Bon appetit.
[184:15.85]No!
[184:17.45]Anything but that!
[184:18.16]This is Stardew Valley.
[184:19.26]Like, seriously dangerous!
[184:21.72]Stop!
[184:22.64]I was framed!
[184:24.60]I was double-crossed!
[184:27.00]No!
[184:27.94]No!
[184:28.44]No!
[184:28.72]No!
[184:29.16]No!
[184:29.86]No!
[184:30.12]No!
[184:30.48]No!
[184:43.98]Damn.
[184:49.32]It's the ones who don't look like bad guys who are the real bad guys.
[185:00.41]I see again.
[185:01.37]Oh, well.
[185:04.78]I'm just saying I got to use that.
[185:05.86]How often does that kick?
[185:08.32]Refresh.
[185:10.00]I did take a lot of damage though.
[185:11.12]That was, I mean, well, come on.
[185:12.12]The first time you see a boss, I can go back in time travel and get an S. Like every 30 seconds, every few minutes.
[185:18.12]That was a cool fight though.
[185:27.82]That was fun.
[185:32.09]Congratulations.
[185:33.99]You have been recognized as number nine in the galactic rankings.
[185:39.25]What's that light?
[185:40.53]Is it... flying?
[185:42.23]Weller?
[185:42.93]Talbot?
[185:44.33]You guys are up.
[185:45.77]You know, I never actually knew those dudes' names till now.
[185:49.30]The series is going to keep going, right?
[185:51.74]So we kinda had to give some names.
[185:53.78]Council style, huh?
[185:56.12]You like it, don't you?
[185:57.32]They have names.
[185:58.38]Not bad.
[185:59.24]But whatever.
[186:00.56]This is space, right?
[186:02.06]Can we do the small talk later?
[186:04.06]Space.
[186:04.52]You're still at the number nine spot.
[186:06.40]You've got a ways to go.
[186:07.68]Okay.
[186:08.82]I thought you couldn't touch those.
[186:10.34]But before all that, I want to ask you something.
[186:13.44]Also, I need to talk to you.
[186:17.13]You want to ask me something?
[186:18.77]Why are you helping them?
[186:20.41]Is it because it's your job?
[186:22.03]It is for you.
[186:23.17]I mean, being your wife and all, I do what I can to help my husband out.
[186:28.91]What does that even mean?
[186:30.93]These guys are basically evil aliens.
[186:33.83]We do not know when they might swarm Earth, so we need some kind of order here.
[186:39.85]Yeah, that's true.
[186:41.07]If we're using the same type of ranking system as usual, then I've got a lot more experience.
[186:46.22]Are they married?
[186:47.18]I don't remember that at the end of the second game.
[186:50.22]I don't remember kids.
[186:51.20]Wait, did he say kids?
[186:52.44]That's Travis Strikes Back lore.
[187:20.32]I'll just read the Wikipedia page for Travis Strikes Back, whatever it is.
[187:29.08]Alright, so we're at number 9.
[187:40.32]Oh, the intro.
[187:40.92]Never skip the anime intro and outro.
[187:49.54]I almost just accidentally did.
[187:55.13]Every time you watch an anime intro and outro, you experience those same internal dopamine hits.
[188:03.68]That's why you never want to skip them.
[188:04.62]Because everybody has their favorite moment in the anime intro or outro.
[188:09.06]Or like their favorite characters on screen doing something really cool animated at 60 FPS.
[188:13.48]Because they don't do that in the real show, the actual show.
[188:16.42]So your favorite character does this like dash, slash, slash, jump, eye into the camera at like 700 frames a second.
[188:22.90]You know you're never going to get to see that actually happen in the show.
[188:25.62]Maybe you will in some shows.
[188:28.50]Man, looks great in that intro.
[188:33.68]Somebody shows intros are better than the actual show.
[188:41.62]Slash toward tomorrow.
[189:01.44]The game's already over.
[189:02.44]It is not already over.
[189:08.03]Play Travis Frikes again next stream, loser.
[189:27.99]Don't tell me what to do.
[189:33.56]I hope we get a, are you still watching?
[189:35.35]That'd be hilarious.
[189:36.03]Dick.
[190:13.00]Interesting character.
[190:14.86]I feel like there's three people in there.
[190:15.94]There's two people standing where the shoulders are.
[190:18.98]And they're all moving as one.
[190:53.08]They're on a custom map.
[190:54.44]GM Flatgrass.
[191:13.18]Oh, that's funny.
[191:17.85]What's Miike's best film?
[191:19.71]That'd be Gozu.
[191:20.35]What do you think?
[191:22.29]Gozu, of course.
[191:25.06]What's the most badass Miike film then?
[191:27.78]Dead or Alive.
[191:28.88]You?
[191:29.78]Shield of Straw.
[191:31.32]Nice.
[191:33.66]What's the most fucked up Miike film?
[191:35.84]Audition, right?
[191:37.04]Everything you need to... Hold on, let me read this.
[191:38.57]I'd say Visitor Q. Oh shit, I haven't seen that one.
[191:43.09]For reals?
[191:44.81]You gotta see Visitor Q. Let me borrow it.
[191:48.08]By the way this is all actual film commentary?
[191:49.84]What do you mean?
[192:15.12]They pulled transcripts from actual film critic stuff?
[192:18.72]They're real.
[192:19.86]Really?
[192:20.22]Oh, I got the Gull Joe t-shirt.
[192:29.05]I kind of need to see that.
[192:29.81]I feel like I'm going to put that on.
[192:38.60]Ooh.
[192:46.35]I like that.
[192:46.81]Okay, so put it on.
[192:56.33]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[192:56.95]I want to see... Come on.
[193:07.22]I pressed L. I don't know why it didn't register.
[193:11.00]L, R. I can't switch to L. Oh, it's because this is a whole outfit.
[193:18.70]Oh, I get it.
[193:24.62]Kill.
[193:27.82]We're talking about real movies.
[193:29.48]Oh.
[193:29.62]It was Gold Joe.
[193:33.86]Mmm.
[193:37.18]I wish the Gold Joe shirt was actually gold.
[193:45.29]Anything should be gold?
[193:50.03]Alright, I'll put that on.
[193:54.43]I'll wear the jacket for a little while.
[194:00.07]And we gotta change our outfit every time we get a chance.
[194:02.81]I don't want to just wear the same thing.
[194:05.33]Okay, save it.
[194:07.41]Wait, Gene.
[194:09.39]What's up?
[194:10.81]Gene?
[194:17.34]Meow.
[194:17.68]Meow.
[194:20.49]What is the last Japanese movie you watched?
[194:24.57]I don't know.
[194:25.21]I can't tell you the last movie I watched.
[194:29.13]Can I?
[194:30.57]Oh, yes, I can.
[194:32.07]Cromwell.
[194:49.55]Was it good?
[194:49.97]I don't know.
[194:51.03]It was free on YouTube, and I was just like, this is kind of funny to watch this.
[194:56.96]It's one of those movies where everyone talks like this.
[195:00.60]Will it please the court for them to know that Cromwell, I will be exiled?
[195:04.92]Like, it's one of those movies.
[195:08.62]Parliament, parliament needs to, I will not stand for parliament.
[195:13.27]We will absolve and dissolve parliament.
[195:17.28]That was the whole movie.
[195:18.35]And then there was a bunch of fight scenes and stuff.
[195:26.23]Alright, I gotta kill some more people.
[195:31.74]What was the last Japanese movie you watched?
[195:35.12]Cromwell.
[195:35.84]No, I... Cromwell takes place... It's based on the... English and Ireland and Scotland.
[195:42.76]They're all, like, fighting each other as priests and shit.
[195:44.97]And there's, like... Because they ride horses, they throw fucking, like... They throw, like, knives at each other and stuff.
[195:50.01]They have sword fights.
[195:51.37]And, um... I... I don't know what his name is.
[195:55.33]Something Cromwell.
[195:56.43]He ends up becoming the King of England.
[195:58.97]Or whatever it was.
[195:59.91]I don't remember.
[196:02.23]I've slept and woke up three times.
[196:05.51]The ads woke me up, okay?
[196:07.81]I'll be honest with you.
[196:08.75]If you watch YouTube movies for free, the ones that are on YouTube, there's like 10 ads throughout the movie and they just, they'll wake you up if you're fucking asleep.
[196:18.51]I don't know when the last Japanese movie I watched is.
[196:21.24]I have no idea.
[196:22.12]I don't know.
[196:33.76]You level up.
[196:34.46]Like, oh, no, you have to get... He never became the king.
[196:39.16]No, he owned Parliament.
[196:42.22]He, like, got rid of Parliament, and then he brought back Parliament.
[196:46.34]Because the king got rid of Parliament.
[196:48.82]So it was like, we need to fight to get Parliament back.
[196:50.60]I don't know, they said Parliament... They said that word like 400 times in the movie.
[197:02.44]Oh, nice.
[197:03.60]Shedded snakeskin.
[197:09.47]And then he became king of Japan.
[197:17.04]What was the last, like, okay, movie based on Japan or in Japan or like a Japanese film?
[197:25.64]Name some Japanese films that have come out.
[197:33.43]Maybe I've seen them.
[197:34.11]I don't know.
[197:39.81]Oh, I got a card.
[197:45.27]Uh... Cromwell's really good.
[197:55.30]I mean, it was entertaining.
[198:03.35]Need to watch Akira.
[198:04.75]I've already seen Akira.
[198:05.65]Like, two decades ago or whatever.
[198:08.35]A decade ago.
[198:15.02]Um... You've seen Spirited Away?
[198:27.81]Yeah, a long time ago.
[198:34.25]Ooh, flame teeth.
[198:36.73]Cromwell is 45% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[198:46.85]Was it really?
[198:47.98]I mean, I didn't watch the movie because I thought it was going to be a good movie.
[199:01.35]Oh, I also saw the when Lindsay Lohan pretends to be pregnant.
[199:05.31]The whole movie.
[199:06.99]I forget what it's called.

[202:23.42]I give up.
[202:23.80]What is it?

[202:40.24]God, how?
[202:41.86]Right.
[202:46.88]The movie was so bad that he forgot it.
[202:49.60]No, it's... Whatever.
[203:03.10]I'd like to test out your true fortitude.
[203:04.24]Could you please clean up all the grass?
[203:07.71]As a show of respect for your whimsically good heart, I shall reward you handsomely.
[203:11.49]But let's be completely honest.
[203:14.47]If I don't even remember the title of the movie, and it's in one of the most celebrated franchises ever, I probably didn't care that much.
[203:22.36]Right?
[203:23.22]I can't pretend I did.
[203:24.16]Alright, let's do another Melanwa.
[203:32.48]Lagx just gave 50 community subs.
[203:34.50]That's insane.
[203:36.32]That's a massive amount of community subs.
[203:39.86]That's hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[203:43.41]Holy shit.
[203:47.75]Thank you, Lagx.
[203:49.13]That's insane.
[203:50.11]That's a lot of money.
[203:50.83]Alright, I'm gonna do this right.
[203:56.95]I really do blame the camera, though.
[203:58.54]I'm going to.
[204:03.49]I think doing this like little spurts, it helps.
[204:05.55]I missed a piece of the dart.
[204:35.99]Next game.
[204:36.67]I'm not doing next game.
[204:37.71]I'm playing this.
[204:38.19]This is No More Heroes 3, but we went three years for this.
[204:40.33]No.
[204:48.10]Turn, turn, turn.
[204:50.86]Didn't even have to look.
[205:00.54]Good.
[205:00.76]That's good.
[205:04.18]Is there anything higher than gold?
[205:10.93]Thousand.
[205:11.35]That's it.
[205:17.24]Okay, well that's lawn mowing.
[205:19.60]And then I've got this.
[205:21.60]Volume one volunteer mission.
[205:23.08]Sure.
[205:29.00]Wait.
[205:34.45]That was the tutorial.
[205:50.37]Shit!
[205:50.61]I didn't know it could overheat.
[206:09.82]Only three minutes.
[206:24.79]We got plenty of time.
[206:25.41]I'm good.
[206:36.09]Back.
[206:46.98]I hate turning that camera.
[206:48.30]Camera's the worst.
[206:58.08]Damn it.
[206:58.98]I wish that just turned with you.
[207:00.13]Why do I have to use my other right stick to turn too?
[207:02.15]Oh, fuck you.
[207:21.65]Oh, God.
[207:22.39]Give me a break.
[207:27.58]That was not clean, but I'll take the money.
[207:35.54]Using turn signals with a mower.
[207:37.08]Bronze.
[207:38.20]Yuck.
[207:39.86]I don't care.
[207:52.11]New level has been unlocked.
[207:55.33]Be cool.
[207:57.46]Alright, new level unlocked.
[207:58.64]It's probably later on.
[208:02.38]There's a toilet over here.
[208:03.14]Oh my goodness.
[208:10.74]Have you ever mowed a lawn in real life?
[208:17.53]Yes, many, many times.
[208:21.11]When I'm mowing the lawn, I don't turn my head backwards.
[208:24.39]And use my left and right thumbs to turn.
[208:28.84]So, excuse me.
[208:33.08]Where is this?
[208:34.24]Where's this toilet?
[208:40.80]Got it.
[208:41.58]If this game blows it, it really doesn't.
[208:45.24]I assure you.
[208:56.58]Alright.
[209:01.08]Where is it?
[209:01.58]Fuck the haters, no.
[209:35.13]Serial shitter.
[209:42.54]The recording thing.
[209:44.84]I'm so confused by that.
[209:47.82]We'll save the game.
[209:52.00]No more heroes is if, like, someone turned the combo's pizza snacks into a video game.
[209:57.56]Why do I know what you mean?
[209:58.77]Yeah, I get it.
[210:00.49]Yeah, that's true.
[210:10.13]It's such a weird thing to understand, but I know what that means.
[210:13.83]What's over here?
[210:25.22]By the way, I can't find those anymore.
[210:26.96]You know what else I can't find?
[210:28.02]This is really starting to agitate me.
[210:31.72]Pretzel Goldfish.
[210:32.78]What happened to them?
[210:33.56]Where are they?
[210:35.64]I can't find them anywhere.
[210:39.70]Have you noticed that?
[210:40.26]Those are my favorites.
[210:48.91]They still exist here.
[210:53.59]I feel like there's a few places in the world or in the country or something that are not getting the supply or something.
[210:58.27]Alright, you have the driving skills of a true champion.
[211:01.37]Could you possibly entertain a request?
[211:03.83]These vulgar thugs, only able to follow their flock, have been utterly terrorizing the highway.
[211:08.90]The other day my grandmother was on her way to work when these cretins almost ran her off the road.
[211:13.60]It was probably me.
[211:16.24]I absolutely cannot abide.
[211:17.41]Please put these criminals in their place.
[211:21.35]Destroy the head runaway car before time runs out.
[211:23.99]Destroy the followers to extend the time limit.
[211:26.75]Don't hit normal cars.
[211:33.95]There's actually a pretzel goldfish shortage.
[211:38.99]It's really sad.
[211:46.43]Okay, accelerate, brake, boost.
[211:50.21]Do I have to smash into them?
[211:53.39]What?
[212:02.95]Um... Holy shit, I'm going too fast.
[212:15.19]Those gems.
[212:22.92]I'm so close.
[212:23.64]He's right here.
[212:31.42]Ooh!
[212:33.00]Fuck, I'm sorry.
[212:38.27]Just avoid the cars coming this way.
[212:39.59]That's all I have to do.
[212:48.48]Shit!
[212:49.72]You know what?
[212:50.34]This is the stupid Toad level in Mario Kart.
[212:52.56]The Highway Toads.
[212:53.46]Whatever it's called.
[212:55.34]It's my least favorite Mario Kart level in the entire 30 year span of that entire series.
[213:00.36]I hate that level.
[213:01.00]It's a little stupid.
[213:11.10]All the Toads drive on the wrong side of the road.
[213:21.87]Come here.
[213:25.33]Come here!
[213:25.93]There he is.
[213:37.92]It's over, that's fine.
[213:53.04]Make a funny sound, please.
[213:54.00]I just did.
[213:56.22]I just did the toad finish!
[213:58.30]You just heard it.
[213:59.10]I just did it.
[213:59.70]You just got a funny sound.
[214:01.00]That wasn't funny.
[214:09.96]The whole world doesn't drive on the wrong side of the road.
[214:13.40]But where, okay, but are toads, is toads in England?
[214:18.87]Is Toadville in, like, Europe?
[214:34.77]Japanese.
[214:35.85]Doesn't Japan drive on the right side of the road?
[214:39.93]I thought Japan drives on the right side of the road.
[214:43.21]There's one or two other countries on Earth that do that.
[214:46.59]Where is it?
[214:47.01]Singapore?
[214:50.89]Is it Japan?
[214:51.41]Singapore?
[214:51.77]Who does it?
[214:54.65]South Africa.
[214:55.89]The United States.
[215:03.99]No, I'm serious.
[215:04.91]It's more than a few countries.
[215:07.23]Who else?
[215:07.53]Who drives on the right side of the road?
[215:17.29]USA, China, Russia.
[215:18.56]Japan too, right?
[215:20.76]No, not Japan.
[215:26.66]Mexico does?
[215:27.36]Yeah.
[215:27.90]All of South America.
[215:34.31]Japan drives on the left side.
[215:36.21]Well, I haven't seen a Japanese movie, okay?
[215:38.03]In a long time.
[215:38.91]So I don't know anything about Japan, apparently.
[215:47.44]Most countries do drive on the right.
[215:50.44]I'm thinking of like the metric system.
[215:53.11]Versus empirical, right?
[215:56.03]Who is it?
[215:57.57]I got it wrong.
[215:58.37]I'm thinking of like the metric system.
[216:00.23]Who uses the empirical?
[216:08.03]Imper- Whatever!
[216:08.35]Imper- Whatever it's called.
[216:09.31]Who uses- It's the United States and like three other countries.
[216:14.11]It's- I'm not drunk.
[216:14.51]No, I'm not.
[216:14.75]It's the U.S.
[216:15.86]and My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My- My
[216:38.00]Okay, let's go.
[216:39.26]How much money do I need?
[216:47.72]Shit.
[216:48.12]I need $25,000.
[216:48.87]How much do I have now?
[216:49.95]Alright, I gotta turn around.
[217:07.18]Dude's got a garlic aioli brain.
[217:09.28]No.
[217:10.08]Oh my god.
[217:17.31]There's a toilet over here.
[217:27.14]Let's make some money.
[217:32.18]This game is tight.
[217:33.32]It is.
[217:33.56]This game is awesome.
[217:37.79]Where are these missions?
[217:38.43]This one's like over here.
[217:39.41]Hello.
[217:52.04]You eat raw cloves, admit it.
[217:57.12]I mean, look, I don't want to tell people to eat raw cloves of garlic because it's really, really harsh.
[218:02.36]I already did this shit like three days ago.
[218:06.02]I'm not going to go over this again.
[218:08.92]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, garlic.
[218:10.78]When you crush garlic, allicin comes out.
[218:12.28]And when you cook garlic, you deserve a lot of the allicin.
[218:15.68]We don't have to go over this again.
[218:23.08]Actually, eating raw garlic is really intense.
[218:25.92]And I do not really recommend people do that.
[218:28.98]But, you know, just I'm telling you.
[218:34.33]Pickled garlic is really good.
[218:35.79]Garlic anything is good.
[218:38.05]I love that shit so much.
[218:39.53]You have no idea.
[218:41.66]Empty cans littered everywhere.
[218:43.86]Please go and dispose of all the garbage.
[218:46.82]Okay.
[218:48.39]Pick up all the empty cans.
[219:03.46]Okay.
[219:04.33]Press the A button to pick up trash.
[219:05.53]If you're attacked by an alligator, press the button displayed on the screen.
[219:10.37]Uh... Watch out for alligators.
[219:18.37]Trash.
[219:27.28]Trash.
[219:28.25]I couldn't even read what that said!
[219:29.75]That was an A upside down!
[219:32.61]That was an upside down A!
[219:34.85]I can't- I- I'm not- I'm- This is hard.
[219:40.32]That's what- I know, but like it looked like a fucking A!
[219:42.50]Where's the rest of the trash?
[219:56.29]Trash!
[219:58.66]I don't see anymore.
[219:59.18]Where's it?
[220:04.29]Where's the pieces of trash?
[220:11.41]There's no trash left!
[220:17.22]I don't see any trash.
[220:21.10]That's... okay.
[220:25.28]Listen.
[220:27.40]This is why I'm gonna go on a fucking rant here.
[220:30.27]I'm gonna go on a huge rant.
[220:31.53]I don't know if people are gonna think I'm an idiot and stupid and whatever.
[220:35.95]Why?
[220:36.25]There should have been a goddamn Congress law that all video game consoles should just have the same letters and same button mappings.
[220:44.36]But they're like face buttons.
[220:46.46]Because, like, Xbox X is where the Y is.
[220:50.90]B is where the A is.
[220:52.44]Triangle is where the X is.
[220:53.78]If you play all the consoles equally.
[220:56.06]I play all consoles equally.
[220:57.80]All of them.
[221:00.56]When I put into muscle memory where A is on Xbox One, that is where A is on Switch.
[221:06.85]There should be a goddamn Congress law that states that has to be there.
[221:12.69]Even though it's not even important.
[221:13.65]It's a literally first world problem and nobody really cares.
[221:19.31]Do it again.
[221:26.16]But that's my only defense.
[221:28.92]When I see Y on the screen, I press Y on Xbox.
[221:33.78]If I see X on screen, I might press X where it is on PlayStation.
[221:37.50]Just like, oops.
[221:38.80]It's wherever my muscle memory of my brain decides to go for that moment.
[221:42.82]Unless you play on one console, obviously, then you're not going to have this problem at all.
[221:45.78]But, you know, whatever.
[221:54.15]It's usually the last console that I spent the most time with.
[221:56.99]So I was playing a lot of Xbox before this.
[222:00.11]And I use my Xbox controller on PC all the time.
[222:03.36]So, and where is the rest of the trash?
[222:09.64]Am I freaking out here?
[222:14.87]You see that?
[222:23.64]Rotate.
[222:25.00]The camera wouldn't rotate anymore after that.
[222:27.44]I was literally trying to rotate the camera and it wouldn't rotate any further to see the other side.
[222:31.56]I promise you.
[222:35.98]Play the seal video.
[222:37.16]I already did.
[222:51.03]Is this the tutorial again?
[222:52.45]I want to do the actual mission.
[223:01.16]There we go.
[223:05.61]Play it again?
[223:06.11]I will in a minute.
[223:26.25]Why?
[223:26.69]Fuck!
[223:27.07]That's not why.
[223:27.65]That's Xbox why.
[223:28.63]I just pressed the up button.
[223:30.43]The top one.
[223:31.07]Did I get it?
[223:45.98]I got it.
[224:02.33]It changed the layout.
[224:03.67]I feel like it would do the reverse problem.
[224:05.09]I would start overthinking it and try to hit buttons that were, you know, if it says X on screen, I'll press the right one that time.
[224:16.71]Probably one right here.
[224:17.35]60 seconds.
[224:36.14]Wait till he gets ported to PC.
[224:38.96]Uh, nobody tell him.
[224:46.76]I think nobody's gonna tell him.
[224:56.51]Just emulate it.
[224:59.27]Um, with a switch emulator.
[225:06.28]I don't think that makes it... I don't think those exist.
[225:14.29]The thing is, I don't think I would ever emulate anything on the current gen because it's available to just play.
[225:24.83]The problem with emulate... Oh my god, I have nine seconds left.
[225:26.94]I don't know where it is.
[225:33.30]It's right there.
[225:37.00]I have 0.4 seconds to press A. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[225:38.76]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[225:39.94]Did I get it?
[225:41.57]You got it.
[225:53.79]What were we saying?
[225:56.35]oh right right right so the reason why emulation is something that I have done in the past right is because sometimes you just can't get access to anything even want to play a game from like 20 years ago that is never going to get released ever again and you may even have in a closet up in your like attic or whatever it's just it's impossible to ever do it again
[226:24.93]And, like, I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna take a shot at Nintendo here.
[226:28.91]Um, you don't solve that problem by releasing, like, one Super Nintendo game a week that nobody gives a shit about.
[226:36.79]On, like, the Switch Online.
[226:39.39]Like, oh, new Super Nintendo games available!
[226:41.97]It's, like, one or two.
[226:43.37]It's, like, every, like, week or two.
[226:45.37]Not even.
[226:45.63]Sometimes it's, like, once a month.
[226:50.10]It's, like, you, like, I would actually pay for this.
[226:52.68]I really would.
[226:55.24]And I understand, like, oh, but we don't want to just dump everything.
[226:57.94]I would pay a very hefty, more than, like, Netflix fee.
[227:01.82]I would pay a Netflix-style fee.
[227:05.32]If they just dumped whatever they were able to actually license still.
[227:11.25]Just give us everything.
[227:11.93]I'll pay a monthly fee for it.
[227:15.03]I want to play the games.
[227:16.81]And I will pay for it.
[227:20.75]But, like, well, there's, like, 31 games on the Switch Online...
[227:25.93]And, you know, maybe we'll... Maybe you'll get, like, Rygar.
[227:29.05]Okay, yeah, I guess.
[227:31.60]I don't want to rent.
[227:36.72]I want to own.
[227:37.38]I will pay for these games.
[227:39.59]Yeah, they had the virtual console.
[227:41.13]And everybody, like, loved it.
[227:42.27]And then there was probably some licensing problem to bring it over, right?
[227:45.03]But still...
[227:47.56]I would pay more than what I pay for Netflix.
[227:49.47]They have access to like every available licensed regular Nintendo game.
[227:54.31]And they wonder why people like emulate.
[227:55.73]That's the why.
[227:56.39]Because they want to play.
[227:59.42]Look at the younger audience, right?
[228:00.84]The younger kids.
[228:02.84]They hear all these stories.
[228:05.05]Oh my god, you have no idea.
[228:06.49]Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, Super Mario 3.
[228:09.31]No, you didn't play, um, you didn't play Unicycle.
[228:12.39]That game was amazing.
[228:13.53]The Unicycle racing game for the Super Nintendo?
[228:15.75]You idiot Zoomer, you have no idea how good it was.
[228:19.46]I wanna play.
[228:20.90]Oh, you're never gonna get a chance.
[228:23.42]Like, they wanna have those experiences.
[228:29.45]Dude, I remember Clay Fighter.
[228:31.19]Yeah, me and my, like, 30-year-old buddy are talking about Clay Fighter.
[228:33.99]Oh, Frosty the Snowman, it was awesome.
[228:36.45]Heard, heard, heard.
[228:38.09]Oh, I loved Octafi.
[228:39.49]It was awesome.
[228:40.43]Was that this guy that, this kid's, like, 19, where you didn't play it?
[228:44.44]Good luck, idiot.
[228:45.74]We loved it.
[228:46.32]We played it.
[228:46.84]Don't you wish you had an experience like us?
[228:49.26]They kind of do.
[228:49.90]They want to play it.
[228:50.56]They would love to do it.
[228:54.42]So, like, they have to find a way to play it, right?
[228:57.50]It's not rocket science.
[229:11.39]And I don't know, but, like, punishing, like, I don't have, like, a reason to go get Clay Fighter for the Super Nintendo.
[229:18.70]Like, I don't.
[229:19.48]Well, like, Clay Fighter, 63 and 3rd, whatever.
[229:21.64]Because I already experienced that.
[229:23.98]I played it a shitload when I was younger.
[229:26.45]And if we're gonna hold these games to this, like, really high, almost, like, almost, like, almost, like, gatekeep-y standard to, like, the younger gamers, they should have an avail- they should be able to play it.
[229:36.77]They should have an opportunity to play it without having it being illegal.
[229:49.68]That's just what I- that's just what I think.
[229:57.38]Why is it being illegal stopping you?
[229:59.46]Well, I'm not saying it is, but the fact that, like, you... Look, it... Going and getting, like, an emulator and downloading ROMs and shit, it's like nobody... People, like, actually kind of don't really want to do that.
[230:13.13]Like a young audience, like when I was like 13, 14, 15... Oh, what you gotta do, you gotta go to this piece of software, you gotta go to this ROM, you gotta drag the ROM into here, by the way, hit escape, and you have to configure a bunch of fucked up video settings, and oh, by the way, maybe the ROM doesn't work, oh, but careful for viruses and shit.
[230:28.46]It's like, it's just troublesome.
[230:36.14]It's not the same experience.
[230:37.51]Yeah, and look, I am forever grateful to the people that were able to kind of archive a lot of this stuff.
[230:47.46]Because without emulation, without people doing ROMs and emulation, having it be like a real passionate thing that people did, we probably wouldn't be able to even have half of these things.
[230:57.30]We wouldn't be able to even care about half of these franchises, I don't think.
[231:05.74]Alright, what do I need?
[231:07.16]Get C rank or higher in one defense mission.
[231:10.14]I did it already.
[231:10.64]Otaku Freak is the name of this item.
[231:15.79]Um, I guess I'll put it on.
[231:17.05]Okay.
[231:29.62]But here's the thing, I'm also not naive enough to say that, oh, just put all 700 Super Nintendo games up on the Super Nintendo Online Switch thing.
[231:40.54]Like, there's licensing deals, there's, like, music that probably was in some of those games that they can never, like, actually release ever again.
[231:47.09]I get it.
[231:47.91]I do.
[231:49.59]But it'd be nice to see, like, a real actual effort to really put on a bunch of stuff that they can put on.
[232:04.57]Like, Super Mario RPG can't be released easily again.
[232:08.61]Right.
[232:19.00]Isn't that a huge reason why we're never going to see Turtles in Time?
[232:23.16]Probably.
[232:23.60]But who stands... I hate... Okay, here we go.
[232:28.46]You ready?
[232:29.88]Who stands to gain from that, though?
[232:33.40]They're not selling copies of Turtles in Time really anymore.
[232:36.45]They remade it, right?
[232:38.59]Didn't they like redo like Turtles in Time or like a version of it?
[232:42.62]They made like a new beat-em-up like five or six years ago, right?
[232:46.89]They're not selling Turtles in Time anymore.
[232:48.47]Like, why?
[232:48.91]Like, I don't know.
[232:49.41]I just don't understand why.
[232:51.63]It's such an awesome piece of media that people should be able to enjoy.
[232:54.37]And even if they were to get it together and, like, charge for it again, like, a few bucks or something.
[232:59.40]Whatever.
[232:59.94]That's fine.
[233:01.16]But just to, like, delete this shit from all history and say, don't ever look at it ever again.
[233:06.02]Don't look at it.
[233:06.90]If you look at it, then you'd say legal.
[233:09.80]But, I mean, it was awesome.
[233:11.04]I, like, want to look at it.
[233:16.67]You can't, like, okay, you can't, like, have the Picasso be a painting that existed.
[233:24.55]And then you, like, put the Picasso behind a fucking, like, a black screen.
[233:29.21]Just because it's fucking, like, more than 100 years old.
[233:35.80]Well, you see, uh, oh, I want to come see, I want to come see all Picasso's paintings.
[233:41.02]Well, see, there's an issue there.
[233:43.98]You can't look at them anymore.
[233:46.84]Why not?
[233:48.18]Well, because it's been a pretty long time.
[233:50.87]And, uh, we just kind of don't feel like showing it to anybody anymore.
[233:55.13]So, what about, can I, there's images of Picasso's paintings online.
[233:59.19]Yeah.
[234:00.31]You look at them, you go to fucking jail!
[234:03.59]Okay.
[234:04.37]Um.
[234:05.79]Thanks.
[234:06.61]Appreciate it.
[234:07.27]Uh, I guess I, uh, my, like, older, like, 35-year-old boomer friend will tell me how cool they were.
[234:25.21]Alright, I'll rant over it.
[234:34.31]Don't give them any ideas.
[234:35.91]Alright, what am I actually supposed to be doing right now?
[234:38.46]I've lost all control of the stream.
[234:40.00]What was I doing?
[234:40.52]Okay.
[234:42.36]ATM, I gotta make 25,000 Utopia coins.
[234:47.54]So let's go do a mission.
[234:51.92]Get on the highway and head to the Thunderdome.
[234:53.44]Okay.
[235:05.56]Friends with 35 guy.
[235:07.14]Friends with older 35-year-old.
[235:09.34]No, I'm just saying.
[235:10.72]Like, you get to watch, like, YouTube videos of dickheads like me telling you, oh my god, and it was the coolest thing ever.
[235:22.93]It was the best experience ever.
[235:25.39]It was so fun.
[235:26.49]You said rant over.
[235:33.77]I know.
[235:55.43]I love the weekly rants.
[235:56.75]Keep it up.
[236:02.01]Ooh.
[236:03.31]Something right here.
[236:10.06]Where is it?
[236:12.10]ATM?
[236:12.76]Wait.
[236:13.16]Where's the... There it is.
[236:19.94]Oh, it's the ramp.
[236:21.93]I can't say that.
[236:24.11]Those are facts.
[236:24.93]Oh, there's Twitch here.
[236:25.89]Twitch dev.
[236:26.27]What's going on?
[236:26.73]Hello.
[236:32.11]Wesson Mining is dangerous and can prove fatal.
[236:33.85]No one ever returns.
[236:35.47]I'd like to test out your true fortitude.
[236:36.73]Could you please take over Wesson Mining in the cave?
[236:40.15]Alright, mining?
[236:40.75]It's Bonzi, buddy.
[236:55.03]It is.
[236:55.27]Okay, dig up Wesson before the time runs out.
[236:58.93]Just swing the pickaxe.
[237:01.19]Run around and mine.
[237:13.29]I get it?
[237:13.71]I got it.
[237:13.99]Okay, go.
[237:16.25]Shut up.
[237:16.99]Okay, I gotta count how many times it takes to do it.
[237:27.26]It's lava.
[237:31.11]Like, can I go over here?
[237:32.71]No.
[237:32.93]Where is it?
[237:33.43]Is that it?
[237:34.73]It's two out of two.
[237:35.71]How do I leave?
[237:36.27]Is that it?
[237:48.19]Oh, okay, okay.
[238:02.12]I heard you talk shit about Nintendo.
[238:05.60]I'm not talking shit about Nintendo.
[238:08.14]I'm just bringing up a point.
[238:11.92]I'm playing on a Nintendo console right now.
[238:17.73]But here's another part two to this.
[238:19.63]This is a really important part two.
[238:21.91]I think we don't think too much about this particular part two.
[238:26.15]What happens in another 50 years?
[238:27.90]100 years?
[238:29.90]What happens in 30 years?
[238:31.56]When like 10 more consoles are out?
[238:33.76]Does this all just disappear?
[238:35.06]All this shit that we've done?
[238:37.66]We have to like preserve this stuff.
[238:41.23]Otherwise it just goes away.
[238:53.44]Dude, there are people that like, they turn off like the servers to play games sometimes.
[238:57.28]Like all these, that's like the big proponents against always online games, right?
[239:06.36]What happened?
[239:16.40]Well, let's try that again.
[239:17.48]You can fall in the lava.
[239:27.32]Look at the seal video.
[239:29.36]No.
[239:32.42]No, I refuse.
[239:36.98]You mined straight down.
[239:39.49]Yeah, kind of.
[239:40.49]Alright, well I'm gonna go this way.
[239:49.75]Jump with fire!
[239:56.77]What happened?
[239:57.09]I have to fight enemies in here, too?
[239:59.27]What the fuck?
[240:03.05]I'm so confused.
[240:03.89]Get out of here.
[240:10.41]What?
[240:38.60]I gotta remember how to get the hell out of here.
[240:39.82]Alright, this is two.
[240:46.04]It's two heavy hits and that's it.
[240:49.58]Seven.
[240:49.92]Two out of seven.
[240:51.00]This is gonna be my least favorite one.
[240:57.83]I'm gonna get so lost here.
[240:58.81]Ayayay.
[241:04.65]Get it!
[241:06.19]Oh my fucking god, this sucks!
[241:15.29]Same exact place.
[241:16.27]I'm going to try this one more time, then I don't even care.
[241:24.34]This is level one.
[241:25.56]Three, two, one.
[241:45.06]I'm going to go left.
[241:46.26]Wait for this fire to go.
[241:47.66]I can jump.
[241:48.65]I just jumped in the... Whatever.
[241:50.79]You all saw what happened.
[241:51.61]I don't need to tell you what happened.
[241:55.67]These missions are tough because they have to actually fight too.
[242:07.78]I don't know where I am, but I apparently was thinking.
[242:23.37]No!
[242:26.13]Pretty good dodges in this tight corridor though, I will say.
[242:32.81]No seal, no meal.
[242:34.41]I'll show the video again.
[242:35.55]I'll play it again.
[242:37.57]It's too heavy, one normal.
[242:46.78]It's too heavy.
[243:09.16]It's gonna explode and... Alright, I'm gonna see.
[243:16.48]Is it three swings maybe?
[243:18.02]Three normal swings and then one?
[243:20.00]I gotta get a good rhythm here.
[243:25.35]It might be one, two, three.
[243:26.89]Three.
[243:33.13]Seal, seal.
[243:34.13]Stop!
[243:34.81]I'll show the seal in like ten minutes.
[243:43.82]Invincible mode.
[243:45.34]It's going to be one, two, let's see.
[244:14.21]One, two, three.
[244:17.03]Let's do three.
[244:18.79]We'll do four.
[244:20.33]One, two, three, four.
[244:22.81]Nope.
[244:23.17]That's a bad strategy.
[244:25.53]We'll do one and then two heavy.
[244:27.69]There's only three more.
[244:28.96]Take it slow.
[244:29.38]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[244:33.34]Where have I not gone?
[244:35.92]I went down there.
[244:36.54]I haven't gone this way.
[244:40.24]I did go this way though.
[244:41.06]No, not all the way.
[244:47.73]Hey, don't be stupid.
[244:48.76]It's up there.
[244:49.24]What about this way?
[244:50.58]One up there.
[244:51.82]Two more.
[244:57.26]Where's this last one?
[244:59.90]Where's the last one?
[245:26.18]Come on!
[245:27.42]Where is it?
[245:32.41]Now I gotta leave.
[245:36.73]There's the exit.
[245:37.53]Can I jump?
[245:37.95]Can I make this jump?
[245:44.08]Done.
[245:50.24]So many noises today.
[245:51.54]Yeah, you're getting a lot.
[245:52.20]You're getting a lot of slurps tonight.
[246:01.75]That's for sure.
[246:06.27]Alright, 25,000, right?
[246:12.70]I still have to do those missions before the boss.
[246:15.84]So... Probably should get over there and start doing this.
[246:22.60]There's actually one over here.
[246:34.59]Seal time.
[246:35.37]Yes, it is.
[246:35.85]Here you go.
[246:51.03]Here's the seal video.
[247:00.01]July 4th, 1984, 1047, 1047.
[247:00.29]Hey, hey, hey.
[247:27.20]This actually might be... This actually might be the best video ever that I've ever seen.
[247:47.67]It's pretty high up there I think.
[247:51.41]I think it is.
[247:59.64]We can't see?
[248:00.32]Oh, well... You'll just take... I can't put it up right this second.
[248:10.65]It's on the subreddit.
[248:13.27]r/Jerma985 is there.
[248:19.17]If one of the parasites shot up from its mouth latches onto you, you'll be rendered immobile.
[248:23.76]Watch out for the parasite face attack.
[248:26.72]Pretty sure I fought this dude in the tutorial, right?
[248:28.53]Okay, bring it on for real this time.
[248:29.85]Show me what you got.
[248:30.45]Okay, it moves really slowly.
[248:44.39]Um, because you can't even touch it.
[248:48.07]I thought it was like a pistol or something.
[248:50.45]Here are the ads.
[249:04.06]Alright, let's go.
[249:16.93]What?
[249:17.15]I was in super mode.
[249:24.53]Heavy attacks only, Jeremy.
[249:43.35]Watch out!
[249:44.99]Yeah, this guy is a pain in the ass, isn't he?
[249:53.40]Can I get rid of those?
[249:54.08]Is there any way I can actually, like, kill those things?
[249:57.92]Good toss.
[250:13.75]Again, grab.
[250:15.81]Oh, it didn't work.
[250:19.81]Fuck, that hurt.
[250:32.32]What's that?
[250:32.80]What's that?
[250:33.36]What's that?
[250:34.46]Oh my goodness, that hurt.
[250:38.22]I want to dodge.
[250:38.90]Stop swinging too much.
[250:39.70]You're being greedy.
[250:40.52]Stop it.
[250:42.98]Wait for an opportunity.
[250:46.24]Stop it!
[250:47.50]I have to relax today.
[250:50.22]There we go.
[250:50.64]Eee!
[251:13.03]Here comes a C rank.
[251:13.91]Yeah, whatever.
[251:20.06]Dodge when it's purple.
[251:22.06]Hey man, it's either just easier said than done though.
[251:23.76]You got like a tenth of a second to make that decision.
[251:27.46]Just be happy they're not Ds.
[251:50.65]She's what?
[251:52.47]You know.
[251:56.65]There's another one.
[251:57.45]There's another mat.
[251:57.91]There's something right here.
[251:58.55]I'm kind of standing right on top of whatever this is.
[252:09.54]What is it?
[252:16.22]Number 33.
[252:16.74]Take on the defense mission.
[252:18.00]Two waves.
[252:18.46]Yes.
[252:28.17]Are you going to do another royalty-free movie night?
[252:31.23]I thought about it, but I feel like we've watched the good ones.
[252:40.02]It's two of these katana guys.
[252:41.14]Alright, let's do this right off the bat.
[252:43.46]And...
[253:02.50]Get him from behind!
[253:03.40]Grab him!
[253:10.35]Ooh, nice!
[253:18.29]Recommend the second game?
[253:22.90]Um... Hold on.
[253:27.34]Can't attack right now.
[253:48.55]Come here.
[253:57.17]Can't talk while he's focused?
[253:58.63]No, not at all.
[254:00.17]My brain can only focus on one thing at a time.
[254:02.59]Only one.
[254:03.24]Nothing more.
[254:17.66]That should be a B, at least.
[254:19.08]Right?
[254:19.38]That's a B. That's a B. Oh, it's wave two.
[254:24.38]Oh my god, that's harder than that?
[254:27.97]I forget what these guys do.
[254:36.43]Oh my god, I forget these guys explode?
[254:37.99]I gotta activate these.
[254:46.82]Ow, be careful.
[254:48.55]Holy shit!
[255:00.16]He's gonna ping on Sardines.
[255:05.89]Love him.
[255:22.92]Oh, come on.
[255:24.16]I hate these guys.
[255:24.84]I hate these teleporting bullshit enemies.
[255:32.66]Was that a cat?
[255:51.47]Oh, fuck you.
[255:58.91]What?
[256:07.89]Alright, if this is a C, then this game is hard.
[256:24.75]I could have done that a little faster in the second phase.
[256:29.14]Come on.
[256:29.62]Skill usage.
[256:30.98]Another C. You gotta be perfect to do that shit.
[256:44.39]Okay, somebody said, do you recommend the second game?
[256:47.73]I would say you should play at least the first two.
[256:51.69]The only reason why I didn't play Travis Strikes Again is because I wasn't a fan of the top-down stuff.
[256:56.21]I was gonna play it before this, but...
[257:00.08]I heard very, very mixed things about that game.
[257:03.11]And not only that, it's all top-down.
[257:06.33]I think there's a couple of segments that aren't, but... Um... Where's this fight...
[257:34.94]Oh, there it is.
[257:43.00]Travis Strikes Again is better than 2.
[257:50.80]Um, I really have to give it a chance.
[257:53.66]But someone actually please correct me if I'm wrong here.
[257:57.42]Isn't Travis Strikes Again a 40-hour game?
[258:03.59]I feel like these games... Whoa.
[258:13.10]It's like 12.
[258:15.10]Um, I guess I'm... Is it just wrong?
[258:16.58]Fuck no, definitely not.
[258:19.16]It's like 15.
[258:21.10]Oh.
[258:24.09]Okay, well this is a new, this is like a boss.
[258:26.19]This giant suddenly appeared in the stratosphere and has grown miraculously in minus 270 degrees Celsius temperatures.
[258:33.94]His ice cannons are powerful enough to destroy entire planets.
[258:38.46]Stay calm, your eye camera sensors will scan enemies for weak points.
[258:42.44]That's gonna help.
[258:43.52]These super big dudes always have a core serving as their weak point.
[258:46.36]Alright, so just gotta be careful.
[258:51.07]Haze 1.
[258:54.88]Wow.
[258:56.54]Okay, so hit him in the head.
[259:09.29]Ice core.
[259:12.53]Okay, we're good.
[259:17.05]His mouth is open.
[259:21.67]Yeah.
[259:22.23]Alright, when his mouth opens like a big clam, shoot it in the air.
[259:30.72]Wait for him to open.
[259:35.56]I just... I didn't get it.
[259:45.91]His mouth is open now.
[259:46.83]Shit.
[259:47.71]I messed up.
[259:48.41]I messed up.
[259:48.79]I messed up.
[259:51.83]Wait till he opens his mouth.
[260:02.16]There he goes.
[260:03.14]Open up.
[260:05.34]Open.
[260:09.53]Open.
[260:09.81]There's a shit in his ears.
[260:26.71]Alright.
[260:28.77]Fuckhead.
[260:32.73]Just keep saying the same thing.
[260:40.67]Say anything else, Travis.
[260:44.61]Open your mouth.
[260:49.46]I didn't even hit him.
[260:50.38]What?
[260:50.60]Oh, I guess it's... Okay, whatever.
[260:58.68]Whatever.
[261:02.40]Stop blocking!
[261:08.00]What just happened?
[261:11.56]What?
[261:15.38]Was I just not even paying attention to my health or something?
[261:17.52]Are you serious?
[261:25.47]What?
[261:26.39]I don't understand.
[261:28.67]I just wasn't looking at my health.
[261:37.66]I had literally one HP.
[261:39.08]Oh, that's annoying.
[261:40.58]Why was I not looking at that?
[261:41.60]I don't think I even had a heal.
[261:45.96]Oh, shit.
[261:51.16]It is over there.
[261:51.76]There's so much stuff on the screen, it's almost like I couldn't even pay attention to it. ...
[262:07.64]Doesn't hurt.
[262:09.56]You know what?
[262:10.34]I'm not... Fuck the cannon.
[262:13.80]Yeah, like, fuck the cannon.
[262:16.62]I'm not even going to use the cannon.
[262:18.86]These things are just better.
[262:23.98]Okay.
[262:38.03]Go for that gas breath!
[262:40.75]Alright, over here.
[262:51.91]Watch that help.
[263:00.14]Oh!
[263:00.36]That hit!
[263:01.66]God damn it.
[263:02.24]It's so hard to avoid that.
[263:16.75]Let's get away.
[263:21.45]Okay, now this is where he killed me instantly last time.
[263:28.64]Hit him in the hands.
[263:31.34]Let's get that core.
[263:42.03]Okay.
[263:47.74]Come here.
[263:50.18]Oh, shit.
[263:52.22]Where are those things?
[263:56.12]I don't want to hit them.
[263:56.88]Alright, phase two and he's dead.
[264:03.46]That's a very bad score because I died.
[264:11.90]Down, pesky-ass mosquito!
[264:18.49]I swear he didn't say that this much when I played.
[264:23.43]Yeah, I know what it is.
[264:36.96]Really?
[264:41.70]Interesting.
[264:49.99]Because I died.
[264:50.57]Yeah, how many of these would I not get a C on if I knew what it was, didn't take a bunch of damage, and could retry it and do it again?
[264:57.32]There's two more.
[265:03.72]There's actually like three more.
[265:05.14]Oh, there's a toilet.
[265:16.31]Let's do the toilet.
[265:17.79]And this one over here.
[265:22.95]This is also a... Is it red?
[265:26.23]This one's just regular.
[265:26.97]To the toilet first.
[265:29.49]This is what Vegas looks like.
[265:36.18]Kind of.
[265:38.34]A lot of it.
[265:44.14]What is that?
[265:44.66]Why does it have a big star on it?
[266:07.59]Is that what it looks like when you step over it?
[266:08.81]No.
[266:08.87]I don't think I've ever seen what they look like on the minimap.
[266:12.33]Hey!
[266:14.69]Oh, my hands are shaking now.
[266:39.57]Do it already!
[266:55.33]My friend is watching.
[266:56.11]Please say something funny.
[267:01.17]Uh... No, I don't really feel like it.
[267:21.34]Yeah, we've reached the part of the stream where I'm just like my back's against the chair.
[267:24.94]Got my Joy-Cons here.
[267:27.82]I'm just leaning back and I'm just enjoying this video game because it's a good one.
[267:32.64]We've reached enjoy the game portion of the stream where I'm just my back is just here.
[267:37.02]Leaning back.
[267:41.50]Evolver Burger.
[267:44.09]I think I've done it 25 times.
[267:48.73]I want to keep the other shirt.
[267:55.43]How is my back doing?
[267:56.27]I'm doing I'm good.
[268:02.39]What else is here?
[268:05.70]The toilet, the bike and the shirt, yeah.
[268:13.46]I was actually not horrible after the dollhouse stuff.
[268:16.92]Which is surprising considering I kind of beat the shit out of myself.
[268:27.14]But, yes.
[268:28.95]The reduced time sitting down has absolutely helped.
[268:34.25]I will be completely honest with you and upfront with you.
[268:36.89]Going back to once or twice a week and not sitting down.
[268:39.65]Because, I mean, a couple years ago...
[268:43.92]two years ago or so I probably really was not doing myself any favors by sitting down here for like seven to ten hours a night because there was like this part of the stream life that I've had when I first started streaming I streamed for like two hours like two or three times a week and then when I made the full kind of transition to Twitch and stopped completely doing youtube at all
[269:11.06]That, I started doing like 7, 8, 9 hour streams.
[269:16.12]3, 4, 5 times a week sometimes.
[269:17.44]At least 3 or 4 times a week.
[269:20.58]And that probably was not a good thing to do.
[269:23.92]This looks hard, hold on.
[269:32.24]So, my body was already having these issues.
[269:35.10]And I was sort of making them worse, I think.
[269:38.95]what ever since being able to kind of sit here and scream for once or twice a week five to seven hours four to six hours something like that I don't have like a time limit really hates this jumping guy so much
[270:05.17]Oh my god, this place sucks.
[270:07.33]I don't think I have any food left.
[270:08.67]There it is.
[270:21.14]Alright.
[270:22.32]Take care of him.
[270:26.12]Ooh, Mustang mode.
[270:27.14]Mustang, Mustang, Mustang mode.
[270:30.54]That's what Mustang mode is.
[270:31.70]Okay, good.
[270:48.00]Did you say you're gonna get a standing desk?
[270:50.26]Yeah, and... So here's the thing, though.
[270:53.00]It's stationary.
[270:55.44]The more that I am stationary, the worse it is.
[270:58.52]So even with a standing desk, standing in the same spot is essentially the same thing.
[271:18.62]Make a treadmill.
[271:19.36]Get a treadmill desk.
[271:24.04]No, that's not going to happen.
[271:25.43]I'll be winded in 10 minutes.
[271:27.15]Alright, now I have enough.
[271:29.19]I can do the ATM and start the next fight.
[271:32.95]I think you'll build one Halo with the five community subs.
[271:41.45]Appreciate it.
[271:47.25]But it's not been bad lately.
[271:49.15]That's steep, man.
[271:53.15]There was a few times on stream where you probably saw, like when the facecam was on or not.
[271:58.56]You can always tell when I'm really uncomfortable.
[272:00.82]When my shoulders go back and I push my chest up.
[272:04.56]More than once or twice every few minutes.
[272:05.90]It's almost time.
[272:07.11]Travis is coming.
[272:08.67]Leave him to me, your highness.
[272:11.63]You think you can take him down?
[272:13.85]Of course.
[272:15.53]He is but a simple human.
[272:18.15]I'm going to cut off his arms, and will then proceed to slice him up nicely.
[272:24.43]Hey, tell me about some of your memories.
[272:27.17]Feeling sentimental, hmm?
[272:29.81]Nah, I don't like it when a friend dies.
[272:34.72]This happened a long time ago.
[272:37.62]I went on a family trip to the sea, but I don't remember anything about the ocean.
[272:43.80]What was burned into my memory was a shop with a glass bulb hanging from the ceiling.
[272:50.70]I was moved by the sound of the jingling glass.
[272:54.54]And when I left the shop, there was a white lighthouse.
[272:59.94]But as for where that place was, I have no idea at all.
[273:06.07]That's a nice story.
[273:08.49]Let's go out there and find that lighthouse together.
[273:12.61]lord fool thank you now go Black Knight direction I'm off it's a really weird way to end that cutscene I think
[273:40.28]You know what time it is.
[273:42.06]It's been at least two hours or so.
[273:44.00]I get to do this.
[273:44.87]And by the way, speaking of doing this, what am I eating today?
[273:50.93]What do you guys think?
[273:55.99]Burger?
[273:56.41]No, I'm not feeling a burger.
[273:57.83]Pizza?
[273:58.29]Yup.
[273:59.25]It's been a while since I've had pizza.
[274:00.67]I haven't had pizza in a very long time.
[274:04.68]It's been at least a month or two, maybe.
[274:19.18]That's another great option.
[274:20.44]That sounds great.
[274:24.24]Shepherd's pie?
[274:24.96]I mean, I really want that, because you just said it, but that means I have to make shepherd's pie.
[274:31.05]I have to make mashed potatoes.
[274:33.33]I have to put some ground beef and some onions into a pan simmer.
[274:38.18]That's probably going to take some time.
[274:39.42]I'm going to get that right.
[274:43.44]I don't have mashed potatoes.
[274:48.01]I don't have any ground beef either, so.
[274:50.93]Ground lamb?
[274:52.87]That just made me angry to look over and see that.
[274:55.77]I'm sorry, guys.
[274:57.75]That just threw me off.
[275:00.86]Look at how bad that threw me off.
[275:07.06]I think lamb, I don't like lamb.
[275:10.94]I don't eat lamb.
[275:11.68]I'm not into lamb.
[275:20.17]What's wrong with lamb?
[275:20.95]I don't like it.
[275:21.79]Shepherd's pie is lamb.
[275:28.23]I've always had shepherd's pie with ground beef.
[275:36.29]Maybe my mother made it that way because she knew that I didn't like lamb.
[275:40.01]That's why it's called shepherd's pie.
[275:43.95]I always thought it was like shepherd's pie because...
[275:51.38]That's like what the shepherd ate.
[275:53.28]But that makes sense.
[275:54.08]But the shepherd eats his sheep?
[276:03.09]Yes.
[276:06.83]They're not reindeers.
[276:08.27]What am I talking about?
[276:09.09]It doesn't fly around and deliver presents to people with sheep.
[276:11.51]Of course that's what they do.
[276:13.30]What am I talking about?
[276:17.16]Potage pie is the beef one.
[276:18.52]Oh, okay.
[276:19.50]Come on.
[276:20.30]What's the matter?
[276:22.28]This is fucking hard.
[276:23.16]I have to get at least 10 to 20.
[276:24.04]They don't raise the sheep for fun.
[276:27.86]Hold on.
[276:30.72]It's throwing me off again.
[276:36.31]Well, yeah.
[276:36.81]I thought it was wool, too.
[276:38.19]I thought it was like wool.
[276:43.13]Sheep are raised for wool and milk, you dummies.
[276:51.82]Yeah, I didn't think that they... They raise the sheep to shear the wool.
[276:55.82]Yeah, they don't, like, raise the sheep to make shepherd's pie.
[276:58.10]That's not why they do that.
[277:02.55]Wait, hold on.
[277:03.97]Am I getting fucked with here?
[277:04.97]Shepherd's pie is any red meat.
[277:19.04]That's what I thought, too.
[277:20.06]I think people are just being weirdos.
[277:23.67]Well, I got 15.
[277:25.19]Wow, that actually counted.
[277:26.29]Okay, cool.
[277:30.23]Oh, yeah.
[277:38.09]Okay, well, that's crazy.
[277:41.00]I'll take 17.
[277:41.32]That's not a bad score.
[277:56.49]Okay.
[277:56.77]Save it.
[278:01.16]And probably after I beat this guy, or after I fight this guy, we'll probably call it here and we'll keep going tomorrow.
[278:06.34]Because I'm just thinking about Shepard's Pie and pizza.
[278:08.20]I combined the two, and Shepard's Pie just turned into a hamburger and onion pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.
[278:19.23]And I'm going to try to get that to be a reality.
[278:30.08]Uh, yeah.
[278:30.56]Let's go.
[278:30.94]Did you end the stream by accident?
[278:41.06]No.
[278:47.44]You want some starch with your starch.
[278:56.01]So, who is this?
[278:56.69]I have to go to the Thunderdome.
[278:58.07]Okay.
[278:59.95]I need a sushi place.
[279:04.87]That guy's driving backwards.
[279:06.19]See that truck?
[279:06.69]What the hell was that?
[279:08.05]Try to find me.
[279:23.82]Hey there, Mr. Assassin.
[279:24.68]Let's play a game.
[279:25.46]Try to find me.
[279:26.96]What am I?
[279:27.56]Find me and you'll know.
[279:29.20]Or maybe you won't.
[279:30.58]Because I am the imitator of everything.
[279:33.22]I will wait for you forever in the glorious land.
[279:40.51]Uh, MonkaS.
[279:43.81]Uh, okay.
[279:44.19]Recommendations.
[279:46.33]We got a new movie recommended for you.
[279:47.85]51 Grams.
[279:48.84]What's with the 51?
[279:49.90]51st Chamber.
[279:58.67]Ooh, I have upgrade points.
[280:00.67]Forgot about that.
[280:03.01]Look at how f- Alright.
[280:04.31]I love this game.
[280:04.91]I love this series.
[280:06.85]Holy shit, that building looks awful.
[280:10.13]Truly awful.
[280:11.08]I'm sorry, I'm just gonna- I'm gonna call it exactly how I see it.
[280:13.26]That looks awful.
[280:24.56]There's more artifacts on that building than there were in King Tut's tomb.
[280:43.17]Good one.
[280:43.75]Hey, thanks, man.
[280:52.00]That's the only complaint of the entire game so far.
[280:55.52]The only one.
[281:01.21]And look, I don't even look at the buildings.
[281:04.57]What am I looking at the buildings for?
[281:05.63]I'm not even looking at them.
[281:13.27]So, like, the weight of that problem is very, very small.
[281:28.07]Ah.
[281:28.33]Alright, what I want to do here... I should probably get some of the skill.
[281:31.45]3,000.
[281:31.59]I'll take the health upgrade. 3,200.
[281:47.34]I'll get it.
[281:47.70]I'm gonna have to do it at some point.
[281:51.62]And now that's a running slash.
[281:53.98]And then charge attack.
[281:56.79]That's also really good.
[281:59.85]Battery.
[282:02.41]32 attack or... Yeah, I'll do another attack.
[282:04.29]Okay.
[282:08.93]I think I have enough for no I don't I need no no I can do another health yeah I have 1900 I don't think I can buy anything else can I 22 oh yeah I can alright 22 no yeah wait I can nice
[282:37.75]Alright, no more health for a little while.
[282:38.95]I want to do more damage.
[282:39.87]I feel like I'm swinging too hard at stuff.
[282:44.96]Long dash.
[282:46.78]Oh, it's a double.
[282:49.96]Mash Y to unleash a high sp... That's really cool too.
[282:55.74]Mustang dodge.
[282:59.50]Ooh.
[283:01.07]If you have full health and you do a perfect dodge, you can just annihilate.
[283:04.09]Alright, that's cool.
[283:05.79]Also $30,000.
[283:05.91]Ooh.
[283:10.71]Alright.
[283:12.13]Let's also check the look of this.
[283:23.37]What can I make?
[283:23.95]I can make a third one of these.
[283:25.68]Uh, no, I can't.
[283:30.84]I can make another one of those.
[283:32.36]Heavy attack power down, normal attack up.
[283:36.92]I'm currently doing a lot of heavy attacks.
[283:40.86]Cannot create.
[283:42.52]Death Force attack power 10% up.
[283:43.88]That's a lot of materials.
[283:51.53]When health is at 20% or below, weapon attack power is plus 15%.
[284:03.72]I feel like I'd be too scared to be that low.
[284:09.56]And you're at 88% or above, 8% up.
[284:11.08]I kind of like that.
[284:12.38]I kind of want, like, three of those.
[284:19.12]During slowdown after a perfect dodge, attack power is plus 10%.
[284:22.19]That's cool.
[284:27.43]Attack power down, but damage taken down.
[284:29.83]Hmm.
[284:36.15]After successful guard, power consumed 20% down.
[284:40.16]How long, though?
[284:49.16]Health is at 80%.
[284:50.22]Alright, let's make... Make this one... No, where is it?
[284:58.85]So at 80% or higher, my weapon attack is 8% up.
[285:00.43]Because I'll replace one of the ones that makes me take more damage.
[285:04.43]Yeah, I want this one.
[285:09.58]Because I usually try to stay above 80%.
[285:10.74]I'm a maniac.
[285:12.28]I freak out if I'm not.
[285:13.02]What does the tension gauge do?
[285:16.92]I actually don't know.
[285:17.70]Okay.
[285:25.25]Damage taken.
[285:25.95]5% up weapon attack power.
[285:27.51]I think I'll just... Maybe I'll get rid of this one.
[285:31.15]Getting me into too much trouble.
[285:32.05]So now I just do...
[285:41.32]10% more damage, which includes heavy, but also the regular attack bar too.
[285:45.82]Yeah, I like that.
[285:56.11]Refill on sushi?
[285:56.95]Oh, it's the tiger thing in the corner.
[286:00.39]Alright.
[286:01.11]Can I eat something?
[286:02.27]Can't eat in.
[286:10.03]Alright, I need five of these.
[286:13.21]Essentially makes me run out of money.
[286:14.15]Still haven't used any of these.
[286:17.05]Alright, that's my one.
[286:18.93]Alright.
[286:21.77]I have to pee, but I'm gonna hold it.
[286:22.97]No, I'm not.
[286:24.51]I'll be right back.
[286:25.24]Alright, this is the final break of the evening.
[286:27.14]I will take a piss.
[286:28.08]I'll be right back.
[286:29.00]We're gonna try to beat this boss.
[286:30.92]And we'll probably call it there, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[286:32.86]So, I'll be right back.
[286:34.12]We'll try to fight the boss.
[289:27.49]so you know it's time to like change the pants you have or the underwear like what the hell so the band of my underwear has apparently been this whole time so tight around my waist and I haven't even really noticed that I have those just two indent lines for where the elastic is around my entire body
[289:56.02]And it hurts.
[289:58.41]This actually hurts.
[290:00.55]Ow.
[290:02.63]What the hell?
[290:03.49]How fat am I getting?
[290:10.69]Dude, it's time for new underwear.
[290:11.79]This is nice underwear.
[290:13.19]This is... I just don't fit into it anymore.
[290:17.00]Oh well, whatever.
[290:17.64]Let's come back.
[290:28.63]Time to plan a workout stream.
[290:31.68]Yeah, I need to... I need to figure that out.
[290:34.82]Alright, whatever.
[290:35.26]Let's go.
[290:35.54]Let's try to fight this next boss.
[290:48.75]Save the game.
[290:49.45]Alright, I wonder what this boss is going to be like.
[290:59.18]What's going on?
[291:05.78]I just got some cheese sticks.
[291:09.32]I just actually got fish sticks recently.
[291:11.92]Those things are so good.
[291:22.49]You?
[291:26.00]Ew, really?
[291:27.40]I love, I, those are amazing.
[291:29.06]I love fish sticks.
[291:32.20]Yes, I've, uh, yes, I've seen the South Park episode.
[291:34.51]I think we all have.
[291:37.97]Alright, so we gotta get on the highway and we gotta go back to the Thunderdome.
[291:58.53]You eat like a toddler.
[292:00.79]No, I don't.
[292:02.85]But let's be fair, though.
[292:05.98]The kids menu at every major restaurant always seems to have some real good shit on it that you know you would enjoy, doesn't it?
[292:16.11]I don't order off the kids menu, but I'm just being honest.
[292:24.57]You can't look at the kids menu and go, oh, chicken nuggets.
[292:29.04]Oh, gross.
[292:30.58]Mac and cheese.
[292:31.30]Disgusting.
[292:34.14]French fries.
[292:34.86]Onion rings.
[292:38.02]Apple slices.
[292:39.94]Please.
[292:42.24]If you order from McDonald's anything off the whole menu, then don't give me shit for looking at the kids menu.
[292:51.48]Him would be fair about that.
[293:01.92]Throw up.
[293:03.46]I, look, I eat boring stuff too, like, like salads.
[293:08.46]Caesar salad.
[293:09.56]Ooh, a chopped salad.
[293:15.95]I eat, oh, like a baked fish.
[293:19.55]That was delicious.
[293:20.27]That is fun.
[293:30.44]Tuna is one of my favorite things.
[293:31.61]Yeah, I love salmon.
[293:32.85]I love tuna.
[293:42.93]Caesar salad omega lul.
[293:44.44]Why?
[293:48.76]And by the way, what fancy ass restaurants and food... What are you eating every day?
[293:52.86]You guys have like a personal chef...
[294:12.12]That sucked.
[294:13.96]What's the fight here?
[294:17.34]Let's just do the boss.
[294:25.62]I'm an adult.
[294:26.20]I know how to cook.
[294:26.85]Really?
[294:34.97]The number eight ranked assassin is Black Knight Direction.
[294:38.59]He is a space kidnapper.
[294:40.90]He uses an illegal, unlicensed transfer machine to kidnap important and valuable people in space and sell them to the powerful.
[294:48.70]A dressing?
[294:49.64]I like a lemon, uh, lemon vinaigrette.
[294:52.98]Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.
[294:55.72]I just like olive oil.
[294:58.99]Olive oil is pretty good for just a salad dressing.
[295:02.78]I actually like olive oil and pasta.
[295:04.84]So... I'm less a fan of red and white sauce on pasta and more just olive oil and salt.
[295:10.45]If it's like, oh pasta, that sounds good.
[295:14.79]That's how I like it.
[295:15.45]Prepared.
[295:15.73]Death drive mini girl?
[295:27.78]Have I done enough wrestling moves?
[295:29.24]No.
[295:32.17]Olive oil by itself.
[295:33.11]Yeah.
[295:35.27]Olive oil, salt, and parmesan on pasta is perfect.
[295:37.25]It is.
[295:37.45]Especially if you get a really, really good EVOO.
[295:42.37]A lot of stuff to do in this game.
[295:46.31]It's insane.
[295:53.66]Where's this toilet?
[296:02.67]I like omelets.
[296:03.62]I love eggs too, yeah.
[296:09.16]Omelets.
[296:11.36]Like a fried rice with egg.
[296:13.68]Awesome.
[296:15.56]I love sauteed vegetables and like just grilled chicken in a way.
[296:19.28]I'm a big fan of a lot of different foods.
[296:24.93]You like all cheeses.
[296:25.83]Not all cheeses.
[296:26.63]I actually don't really love soft cheeses.
[296:29.12]I'm not a big brie person.
[296:31.96]I like hard cheeses, not soft.
[296:39.19]Cringe.
[296:46.37]I love horseradish.
[296:47.23]One of my favorite things.
[296:51.27]The wasabi that you get at restaurants that's not real wasabi.
[296:54.34]It's just horseradish that's dyed green.
[296:57.54]I love that stuff.
[296:58.44]I put it on everything.
[296:59.82]I could put that on literally every single food that I've ever eaten and love it.
[297:11.13]What about sauerkraut?
[297:12.33]I'm actually not a big sauerkraut fan.
[297:29.95]Run your Captain Crunch.
[297:32.81]Actually, that's fallen out of favor.
[297:36.15]The Dunkin' Donuts mocha latte cereal has taken over completely at this point.
[297:42.99]Almost 100%.
[297:43.21]Alright, let's do it.
[298:01.66]What the hell is this place?
[298:03.80]Looks like something out of Black Raid.
[298:06.12]So is this Osaka?
[298:08.02]Yeah, it's gotta be.
[298:09.61]Everyone's wearing tigers on their clothes.
[298:16.15]He's here.
[298:17.31]He's gonna fight in the street?
[298:19.23]Probably.
[298:23.26]I don't sense anything.
[298:25.90]Some kind of zen thing maybe?
[298:31.36]They do this every game.
[298:43.76]This isn't your scene.
[298:45.58]I'll be the one to punish them.
[298:47.56]I got no idea who the hell you are, but stay the fuck out of this.
[298:51.74]This town's problems are my problems.
[298:55.06]You're just like they say.
[298:56.84]I've also heard that you can't solve anything without brute force.
[299:00.24]Look, outsider!
[299:01.79]Who the fuck are you anyway?
[299:04.19]I'm from the future.
[299:05.79]It's a long story, but... Don't bother.
[299:08.57]Once we do battle, I'll know all I need to know.
[299:12.05]I wonder when I get my next katana upgrade.
[299:15.71]I wonder how many katanas are in the game.
[299:26.61]What?
[299:27.66]Oh my god, I'm in Mustang mode.
[299:34.24]Where is he?
[299:34.54]I'm in Mustang mode.
[299:35.32]Please.
[299:35.70]Oh, that's sad.
[299:39.56]It's all the way down here.
[299:51.08]Your killer instinct is simply unmatched.
[299:53.50]I can feel it all the way down in my bones.
[299:56.20]I want to express my respect for that fighting spirit and bloodlust, Grandpa.
[300:01.25]This is Death Slow.
[300:02.67]It's quite an elegant ability, perfect for you.
[300:11.41]Death Slow.
[300:13.92]You've acquired a new skill.
[300:15.52]Use its strange power to slow down time in your vicinity.
[300:19.84]Unleash it by holding L and pressing A. So, L and A. That has a cooldown.
[300:24.64]Okay.
[300:26.48]This guy should provide an... I have four viewers watching.
[300:36.24]Wait, hold on.
[300:36.94]Hold on.
[300:37.28]They're coming.
[300:37.70]10.
[300:39.50]12.
[300:39.52]13.
[300:39.54]14. 15.
[300:44.52]Holy shit.
[300:45.38]Here it goes.
[300:45.86]20, 21.
[300:47.38]26.
[300:47.50]We kind of have to wait for people, right?
[300:57.09]I wonder how quickly something like this... Oh, there's two people.
[300:59.71]There's two assassins fighting each other in the street on Twitch right now.
[301:03.64]They have magic powers.
[301:04.86]How fast would this go up, do you think?
[301:08.88]Okay, let's do death slow.
[301:10.40]What?
[301:20.12]Okay, so I slow time down and... Where'd he go?
[301:38.19]50 viewer Andy.
[301:44.63]This is less of a boss fight and more of a I'm teaching you moves.
[301:47.37]I'm probably going to fight him after.
[301:50.74]This would sit at one viewer.
[301:52.24]No, it would not.
[301:55.75]I've been dreaming about our Battle of Souls.
[302:04.21]I want to see how you do once you're more evolved.
[302:07.22]Something I'd like you to have, Grandpa.
[302:09.96]This is the Death Force.
[302:11.72]It's quite violent.
[302:12.84]Perfect for you.
[302:13.44]Got me a skill.
[302:18.93]Okay.
[302:20.67]X. Use its mysterious power to knock enemies back.
[302:24.38]Unleash it.
[302:24.80]Okay, so it's a knockback.
[302:28.64]Okay, try it out.
[302:37.53]Oh, alright.
[302:46.31]That's cool.
[302:51.92]That's very useful.
[302:54.96]It's just a force push.
[303:12.47]Travis not being in Smash is a crime.
[303:14.05]I don't know.
[303:19.53]They've used mature games before.
[303:21.33]Bayonetta.
[303:22.67]And honestly, No More Heroes has just been a Nintendo exclusive.
[303:31.22]They've ported it years later to other platforms, but it comes out on Nintendo platforms every time.
[303:42.13]He's a Smash costume fighter?
[303:43.61]No.
[303:48.76]By the way, have they ran out of character slots to fit on the screen in Smash Brothers yet?
[303:53.05]Or is that still, they still have enough room?
[303:54.69]Okay, imagine what it takes.
[303:59.81]Before we take each other on, I have a present for you.
[304:02.63]There's literally one more left.
[304:07.97]This is Death Rain.
[304:12.64]Yeah, alright, nice!
[304:16.85]Use its weird power to pour down a rain of pain.
[304:19.83]So it's like a... Okay.
[304:24.23]That's right.
[304:35.17]That's right.
[304:40.75]Ow!
[304:40.95]What just hit me?
[304:41.39]Did I get hurt by my own shit?
[304:55.92]Did I win?
[304:56.28]Favorite burger from Burger King.
[305:01.54]It's not a burger.
[305:02.86]It's my favorite.
[305:03.81]It's the Burger King long chicken.
[305:06.79]And just who'd you hear these rumors from?
[305:09.35]You keep tossing out all this fucking foreshadowing.
[305:12.63]I'll explain it all once I take you down.
[305:15.73]You really talk a lot of shit.
[305:17.67]This is where I actually start trying.
[305:24.69]Long chicken.
[305:25.53]Alright, time for the real fight.
[305:32.40]Hey!
[305:32.58]That was not fair, okay?
[305:34.30]I just, like, literally spawned in.
[305:53.01]Those of you that are saying, long chicken, omega LOL, question mark.
[305:55.57]He's stupid.
[305:56.13]He's an idiot.
[305:56.61]Long chicken.
[305:57.15]What's long chicken?
[305:58.85]That's not what it's called.
[305:59.72]It's the original chicken sandwich.
[306:01.54]Original chicken sandwich, Jermo.
[306:02.74]What are you, stupid?
[306:03.60]That's fine.
[306:07.70]That's okay.
[306:12.20]That's completely fine.
[306:18.62]No, that's fine.
[306:19.64]That's cool.
[306:22.66]Uh, he's an idiot, stupid idiot.
[306:29.78]What's that say?
[306:32.40]What's that say?
[306:33.48]Something on there, text-wise?
[306:34.86]Yeah.
[306:40.09]Interesting.
[306:46.23]What's starting at $20,000?
[306:51.78]Is that rent?
[306:55.33]What is that?
[306:56.29]What is that?
[307:01.09]I can't... I don't know what that is, but I don't think I can afford that.
[307:08.94]Holy shit!
[307:13.83]That's not what that meant, right?
[307:18.39]God, that's not a targeted ad.
[307:20.81]No, I don't have that kind of fucking money.
[307:22.84]Targeted advertising.
[307:36.68]That's so stupid.
[307:40.36]I would never, ever, and I don't think that's what that was.
[307:44.79]Was that like a dining room set?
[307:48.49]I think that was like a yearly payment.
[307:50.79]I have no idea.
[307:51.71]I have no clue.
[307:55.72]How much is that a year?
[307:58.78]Hold on a second.
[308:00.66]I need to do a calculation.
[308:01.70]I am so taken aback.
[308:02.88]I don't even know what we're just looking at.
[308:05.56]Hold on.
[308:05.88]This is important.
[308:06.48]$240,000 a year?
[308:19.18]For rent?
[308:23.21]$20,000 a month?
[308:30.99]Holy shit!
[308:41.45]That's unbelievable!
[308:43.89]I really thought that was... Are we crazy?
[308:50.52]Damn, that's- I don't got that money.
[308:52.08]If you got that kind of money, whatever, that's not me.
[308:58.49]That's a mogul move?
[309:09.12]It's a targeted ad.
[309:10.38]That- that's my- okay.
[309:11.90]That's my top 10 favorite moment I think that's ever happened on stream.
[309:14.78]That's hilarious.
[309:18.27]I don't even know what to say.
[309:19.45]That's fucking hilarious.
[309:29.68]Alright, be easy.
[309:30.46]Hold on.
[309:31.56]I can't deal with that.
[309:37.66]I don't even know... Wait!
[309:38.84]Activate it!
[309:46.30]Nice flex on your viewers.
[309:47.64]I honestly don't know why the fuck I got that.
[309:59.55]Oh, I am bashing the shit out of this guy.
[310:01.25]Oh, yup.
[310:05.09]Yup.
[310:05.90]Reign of health.
[310:11.50]You give me these crazy moves, I'm just beating the shit out of this guy.
[310:14.34]He's got an instant chance.
[310:19.56]I ran out of battery.
[310:20.24]That's what's making me have to leave.
[310:24.70]Oh, what's that?
[310:25.38]Oh, sorry!
[310:25.90]Did I just get perfect dodged?
[310:30.52]Is that what happened?
[310:37.53]I'm embarrassing this guy right now.
[310:44.65]Ow, that exploded.
[310:45.31]Alright, whatever.
[310:59.98]Double.
[311:03.40]You see that?
[311:03.90]Are you paying attention?
[311:07.08]Holy shit.
[311:08.92]I annihilated this guy.
[311:16.29]Holy shit.
[311:27.54]Alright, there's three of them.
[311:29.50]Gotta be careful.
[311:30.21]Ooh, shit.
[311:30.49]Easy, easy, easy.
[311:32.85]Don't get cocky.
[311:33.63]There's no reason to be cocky.
[312:02.20]That's a fucking battery problem.
[312:07.68]Oh, see you later.
[312:32.39]See you later.
[312:32.93]Goodbye.
[312:35.35]I know this guy's probably a tutorial to teach you the moves, but I had a good time on that one.
[312:48.70]That's not going to be a C rank.
[312:54.91]No way.
[313:07.03]Oh.
[313:07.09]I can't kill him?
[313:07.67]That's got to be S, right?
[313:32.73]I... How?
[313:35.64]I did everything so well.
[313:36.80]I beat him in three minutes.
[313:37.96]I beat that guy in three minutes.
[313:42.87]That's a C.
[313:57.06]Congratulations.
[313:58.72]You have been recognized as number eight in the Galactic Rankings.
[314:03.01]Looks like you're doing okay.
[314:05.29]Hey, who the hell was that guy?
[314:11.20]There is your answer.
[314:12.56]Your buddy instinctively jumped into action, trying to prevent his kid from getting hurt.
[314:18.05]Why is that?
[314:19.55]What the hell do you mean?
[314:20.89]Someone starts to fall, you help them out.
[314:23.05]Isn't that how it works?
[314:25.51]You are an assassin.
[314:27.03]What are you doing helping people?
[314:29.09]Have you ever helped out any of your other opponents?
[314:32.60]Why would someone as bloodthirsty as you try to save another ranked assassin?
[314:38.16]The reason is... Is what?
[314:41.32]A secret.
[314:42.74]A secret guy, huh?
[314:45.04]Whatever.
[314:48.68]Go ahead and sleep here.
[314:50.42]Rest it off.
[314:53.66]I see you've gotten comfy in the Garden of Slaughter.
[314:57.80]Now, Travis, go.
[315:00.42]Off to swim the Sea of Blood.
[315:06.64]Well, I'm really happy that they pulled the... Here comes a boss.
[315:10.68]Just kidding.
[315:11.22]Someone's going to kill that boss and you fight somebody different for the third time.
[315:16.94]They really love that joke.
[315:20.29]They love it so much.
[315:28.29]It's weird because I'm just sitting here thinking, which one of these guys are they going to do that to?
[315:32.57]So we got our answer.
[315:37.95]It's like the fall joke for me, yeah?
[315:40.65]20k No
[316:11.48]When are you going to buy a mansion?
[316:12.52]I'm not going to buy a mansion.
[316:21.80]Okay, the prospect is terrifying to me.
[316:23.79]Look, if you've got money, you've got money, right?
[316:26.41]If you've got a lot of money, you've got a lot of money, do whatever you want.
[316:29.27]I don't give a shit, right?
[316:30.55]Here's what scares me.
[316:34.75]With an automatic payment coming out of my bank account of more than $20,000 a month, it would give me anxiety.
[316:44.45]20,000 automatic payment Right like if it was like a mortgage, or if it was like a rent.
[316:50.11]That's what that scares the shit out of me I would never want an auto payment to be more than like a few thousand dollars a month ever for any reason I don't care how much money I have that's like terrifying to me In my personal opinion that I would be scared of that much money coming out of my checking account on an automatic basis
[317:28.48]Well, you can afford the long chicken, yeah.
[317:35.41]Just don't check your balance.
[317:36.71]If you had that much, just put it towards the house.
[317:50.88]Yeah, I don't know if I would rent for that much.
[317:54.66]That's a lot of money.
[317:55.84]That's a huge amount of money for rent.
[318:00.03]Calm down.
[318:00.83]Failure after failure.
[318:06.53]Seriously, what kind of aliens are... Calm down.
[318:10.15]Fu, can you really kill this guy?
[318:12.17]Shut up!
[318:16.25]Sorry.
[318:18.52]I love that underwear he has.
[318:21.06]RGB underwear.
[318:49.30]Hey, Prince.
[318:51.60]Can you kill this guy?
[318:53.63]Hell yeah.
[318:54.79]Who do you think you're talking to?
[318:56.87]You seem confident enough.
[318:58.89]Just watch me.
[319:00.27]I'm gonna kill the shit out of you.
[319:02.58]Show me a good time.
[319:03.92]Anything you say, Prince.
[319:06.42]Nice.
[319:14.75]I love how every episode starts with just going to the throne room.
[319:19.01]It's just like this weird back and forth between like the other, the new like weird character that's coming, being introduced.
[319:29.66]They are giving off kind of like a second life DBZ universe, aren't they?
[319:45.36]Alright, let's get to the save point.
[319:47.84]If there's another cutscene we'll watch it and then we're gonna pick it up tomorrow.
[320:06.24]What?
[320:06.66]That's it?
[320:13.17]Got some new clothes.
[320:14.89]New t-shirt.
[320:16.81]Okay.
[320:19.23]Play with Gene and I'm going to save it.
[320:20.53]And we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[320:27.71]But thanks for watching everybody.
[320:29.71]We'll see you tomorrow.
[320:31.87]Probably around the same time.
[320:32.62]Around 4 o'clock.
[320:40.14]Uh, we definitely did not get halfway through the game, but I think this game's amazing.
[320:44.70]I'm having a ton of fun with it.
[320:47.71]So, I'm... If this has to be, like, three streams, that's fine.
[320:52.77]We'll do one tomorrow and see how we feel, and maybe do another one.
[320:56.31]Uh, if not, then we'll pick it up, like... But here's the thing.
[321:00.42]I'm gonna be staying on the Switch.
[321:03.22]Because... Yeah, this'll work out fine.
[321:06.81]So we're going to stream tomorrow, and then wherever we get tomorrow, on the 10th, the new WarioWare comes out.
[321:13.79]You better believe I'm going to play the absolute hell out of that on Friday.
[321:17.14]So maybe we could do like a Friday-Saturday, or Friday-Sunday or something, which would be WarioWare, and then I'll finish No More Heroes.
[321:26.12]I think that'll work out perfectly.
[321:33.04]So, uh, let's pick it up.
[321:34.14]I'm going to be exactly where I'm standing right now.
[321:38.58]We'll check it out tomorrow.
[321:42.94]Sims 3.
[321:43.42]Sims 3 will be probably in another week or two.
[321:45.82]I want to play WarioWare.
[321:48.42]So, I have all the mods done.
[321:50.48]They're all installed.
[321:51.22]They're ready to go.
[321:51.90]I just have to do it.
[321:59.64]I got like seven mods installed and they're all insane.
[322:05.80]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[322:08.00]There was a lot of community subs.
[322:09.16]Oh, the sunflowers, yes.
[322:11.04]There will be a sunflower reveal tomorrow.
[322:15.35]You better believe it.
[322:24.21]Yeah, there were a lot of community subs.
[322:25.81]There was like 50 community subs given in like 10, 10, 10, 10.
[322:31.44]When I looked at the sub count after the Dollhouse stream, I remember I did not think it was going to be that high.
[322:40.73]We have smashed every record I ever held on this channel for subscriptions.
[322:51.46]It's quite a lot.
[322:53.66]The record of the channel was, and I'll be upfront with you, the record of the channel was 12,800 subscriptions.
[323:02.32]Now, I know that this is not going to be this high, probably in 30 days from now.
[323:07.68]But this is, like I said, I'm going to be chasing highs for the rest of my life.
[323:11.76]100k viewers, like, holy shit, that's a lot of people.
[323:16.05]I think the peak the day after the stream was about 17,400 subscriptions, which is like, are you kidding me?
[323:24.73]I do not expect that to continue.
[323:26.52]Because obviously a lot of that might be just people that primed or that gave during the stream, whatever that stream.
[323:33.00]But that's 20k rent money.
[323:37.01]Targeting network.
[323:41.87]Yeah, that's...
[323:45.84]I can't I did it's insane um so regardless if we stay up here at this and I'm saying we right but you know what I mean regardless of uh if 17 000 subs is the highest it ever goes ever we pull back quite a bit maybe that's an achievement that I never thought I'd see we I mean do you remember like a year ago during one of the um
[324:11.92]I think it was the New Year's Eve stream.
[324:13.98]I broke 10,000 subs for the first time.
[324:17.42]When I went to bed that night, I was like, I'm never crossing this ever again.
[324:23.05]I remember lying in bed, just staring at the ceiling, being like, this is never happening again.
[324:28.11]There's no way I stay over that.
[324:33.65]I know I'm saying that again right now.
[324:37.29]Parasocial Andy.
[324:42.47]But I don't know.
[324:47.88]Just a thanks.
[324:49.46]Hopefully I can spend the money well and not on that insane rent.
[324:55.57]Don't worry.
[324:57.49]Just do dollhouse quality streams every day.
[325:06.35]Um, no, I just, I don't want people to think I'm trying to be like, look at how many subs I have.
[325:12.45]No, I just, it's a bit shocking that this many people would even do it in the first place, so.
[325:16.16]Because I talked about it before, and I kind of would like to be a little more transparent about it.
[325:22.92]I don't want to like hide it or anything.
[325:31.57]But thank you.
[325:32.93]We'll see where it goes.
[325:34.01]We'll see what streams can happen because of different opportunities, right?
[325:40.42]The more money that I make, the more I'm going to use.
[325:43.62]And we've had sponsors.
[325:45.16]We've had involvement from Twitch, right?
[325:47.66]So I don't know.
[325:48.36]I'm hoping to continue to do stuff like you saw a couple weeks ago, the last week, whatever.
[325:54.89]Let's give it a shot.
[325:59.95]Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[326:00.75]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[326:02.03]Have a great rest of your night.
[326:03.23]It's probably pretty late for a lot of you.
[326:05.47]Considering it's 9.30 PST right now.
[326:07.80]Or PT, whatever.
[326:08.50]See you tomorrow.
[326:12.94]Good night, guys.
[326:14.66]Take care of yourselves.
[326:52.37]Thank you.
