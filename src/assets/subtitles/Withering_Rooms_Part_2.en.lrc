[ve:60.16.100]

[01:56.37]Oh, hello there.
[02:01.21]How are you?
[02:05.38]Could you guys not hear me at all the last like a minute while I was talking?
[02:12.49]Wow, that's funny because I had a lot to say.
[02:16.30]Uh, I, let me, let me go back.
[02:18.36]Wow.
[02:18.76]I almost want to like, I wish this was recorded on the VOD.
[02:32.67]Intro music is quiet?
[02:34.36]Oh, that's because I gotta go like this.
[02:38.39]Alright, what I said was somebody said, hey, dude, be patient.
[02:40.79]He has a tube TV in his head.
[02:43.64]It was fucking great what I said.
[02:45.91]I almost like want to, I can't, this is impossible.
[02:48.57]I was going off.
[02:50.60]You can't repeat.
[02:52.23]Okay.
[02:52.31]If somebody comes in and let's say you have a bunch of friends and you're telling a joke or you're telling a story to a group full of people, it doesn't even matter if it's friends.
[03:00.25]It could be strangers.
[03:00.88]It doesn't matter.
[03:01.86]And then somebody comes in, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?
[03:05.21]And the second time going through the story is always kind of a...
[03:09.45]a condensed version of it and then everyone kind of looks around like uh yeah and you as the person telling the story you almost point to other people in the room to go
[03:18.36]And yeah, dude.
[03:19.71]And then he, uh, fuck.
[03:21.30]And then he, oh yeah.
[03:22.16]And then what he did is he walked into the hallway and you can never tell the same story twice in a row.
[03:31.39]It was a great story though.
[03:39.22]That was a very convoluted intro.
[03:41.09]Hi, how are you?
[03:42.18]Welcome to the stream.
[03:43.26]We're here.
[03:43.84]We're playing Withering Rooms... again.
[03:53.63]This is a continuation from last night, yesterday afternoon.
[03:58.12]I'm excited.
[04:01.38]When are you gonna get that haircut?
[04:03.55]You know, when it's time, right?
[04:08.19]It's not quite time to do that.
[04:11.30]It will be time.
[04:13.86]Probably soon.
[04:22.99]I don't know when that is.
[04:25.16]I'm going to get up one day and I'm going to look in the mirror and I'm going to go, you know what?
[04:30.02]It's time.
[04:32.36]And then I'll go get my hair cut.
[04:38.00]Just, okay, my hair is on complete borrowed time right now, just to let you know.
[04:44.43]It's just, I've already said it's time, but now I just have to go do it.
[04:50.33]And it's...
[04:51.90]I said that like three weeks ago, so we'll see.
[04:55.19]I did also say that I was gonna do Yakuza 0 Part 2.
[05:00.32]like three weeks after I did part one.
[05:03.60]And that's been about seven years.
[05:05.52]So it's been about six or seven years since I said that.
[05:08.11]So it might take a while.
[05:10.30]You have executive dysfunction.
[05:12.18]Actually, I have a great executive function.
[05:15.41]It's just the act of...
[05:19.37]Okay, here's the thing.
[05:20.96]You line up all the things that you have that you're doing, that you're ready to do,
[05:24.84]It's just...
[05:27.84]The guy that's cleaning up at the end of the day...
[05:31.30]that like kind of locks up.
[05:33.34]It's like, alright, okay, we got everything going on in the brain here.
[05:36.32]That shit's ready.
[05:37.54]That shit's ready.
[05:38.79]Ah, fuck yeah.
[05:39.61]This is gonna be great.
[05:40.33]I can't wait to see when they get in tomorrow how fucking awesome this is gonna be.
[05:44.25]Wow, there's even a slide that they got set up.
[05:47.26]Alright.
[05:48.57]And then, you know, they lock up whoever's there.
[05:50.55]Oh, by the way, I contributed to that shit over there.
[05:52.46]I can't wait to see how that's going to work.
[05:54.27]They lock up, they leave, and then they lose the keys to get back into the fucking building.
[06:02.44]And everyone freaks out in the morning because like, we can't get into the building.
[06:07.12]Where's Joe?
[06:08.92]Well, I don't.
[06:10.22]I had the keys last night.
[06:11.37]I must have.
[06:12.23]Joe, do we not have keys to get in here?
[06:15.07]Oh, I don't.
[06:15.67]I guess we don't.
[06:17.29]And then nobody can get in.
[06:18.75]It's all in there and it's all ready, but we just got to get in the building.
[06:26.72]You break the window.
[06:27.67]Yeah, but if you break the window, that's a great idea, isn't it?
[06:31.16]You smash that window, you spend the next day cleaning that up.
[06:35.15]And you're still not ready.
[06:38.53]Go ahead, break that window.
[06:39.46]Then everybody has to clean that up first.
[06:41.61]And that's part of, that gets in the line in executive decision.
[06:44.14]That gets in the way first.
[06:46.15]And then you spend the energy to clean up all the broken glass and all the fucking damage.
[06:50.39]You're like, oh man.
[06:52.68]That was, we'll do, you know what?
[06:54.85]We'll do this tomorrow.
[06:56.07]We'll get this off the ground tomorrow.
[06:59.65]You said you would lick the camera.
[07:00.93]Alright, time that person out.
[07:01.90]That person's a fucking liar.
[07:07.24]Anyways, how are you?
[07:13.08]Wuthering Rooms we're gonna play.
[07:21.60]That's executive dysfunction.
[07:23.99]No, that's deciding to not do something stupid.
[07:29.63]That is pure executive, total complete function.
[07:37.18]I made the executive decision to not do that.
[07:41.12]Okay.
[07:42.05]Welcome back.
[07:43.68]Hey, I was drunk last night.
[07:44.71]Can you recap the stream?
[07:47.40]Sure.
[07:52.24]I don't think so.
[07:55.57]I don't think I can do it.
[07:57.90]That's so cool.
[07:58.54]When you point the idol at things, it remembers it in the dream.
[08:02.52]What?
[08:04.26]Witches.
[08:05.61]Witches everywhere.
[08:09.96]I hope that caught you up.
[08:20.17]Alright, here we go.
[08:21.18]Last thing we were doing.
[08:23.05]We were...
[08:23.73]Okay, we got the first witch in the upper banquet hall.
[08:28.78]Robert Blackett's room has a key in it.
[08:32.25]And then the first, which is bedroom.
[08:36.39]Didn't I find... Let me go back to nowhere.
[08:38.88]I think I found that, right?
[08:41.98]Didn't I get the new, uh... Grimoire?
[08:45.79]Maybe I didn't.
[08:49.79]I thought I did, didn't I?
[08:50.62]That was the last thing that I did.
[08:53.92]I got a lot of fingers, too, you know?
[08:55.39]I can level up.
[08:57.17]Yeah, I got it.
[08:57.87]So, I'll talk to Emma.
[09:00.82]Oh, shit.
[09:01.30]No, no, no, no.
[09:01.85]Okay, we have to go.
[09:02.47]We gotta go to the doll.
[09:04.49]Right?
[09:05.77]That's what we have to do.
[09:08.67]Alright, where was the doll?
[09:10.10]Doll was up here.
[09:12.54]Alright, so we go back to the observatory.
[09:15.15]Do I have the doll, um, the reanimate spell, whatever it is?
[09:21.29]I do.
[09:21.61]Okay.
[09:23.91]So I need to cast that on the doll.
[09:25.88]I think the doll can help.
[09:27.94]I believe that is the case.
[09:31.13]I didn't see this from though.
[09:33.22]Does the game have a dodge roll?
[09:34.95]Wait for it.
[09:37.18]Yeah.
[09:39.02]Okay, I can't get up there.
[09:39.95]I think I've seen everything.
[09:44.33]I kind of want to curse myself a little.
[09:46.72]Because there's other items in here to get.
[09:48.61]But I have to be cursed for it, so let's go ahead and do that.
[09:59.47]That should be enough.
[10:02.36]One more.
[10:02.72]One more.
[10:06.51]Okay, here we go.
[10:11.95]Maybe that means I can get in the door.
[10:19.80]It does mean I can get in the door.
[10:21.99]Wow, what's in here?
[10:25.63]Organ processing.
[10:26.82]Oh shit, is there a monster in there?
[10:41.38]Finally some relief, this shift has gone on ages.
[10:44.89]I know the First Witch is busy, but this is ridiculous.
[10:47.01]I've been here three nights.
[10:49.18]Since it's your first shift, let me give you some tips.
[10:51.79]If someone brings in some organs, help them use the furnace to create organ grease.
[10:56.56]Alright, this is how you do that.
[11:00.96]Next, have them step into the chamber.
[11:02.43]They just need to pour the proper amount of organ grease into the pot.
[11:06.15]This is how you do leveling up.
[11:08.97]The chamber is truly a mechanical wonder.
[11:10.49]It takes care of everything after that.
[11:13.26]Once they've strengthened their body in the chamber, ask them to go collect more organs.
[11:17.62]Here's the offering list.
[11:19.06]Okay.
[11:20.49]Don't leave or the first witch will be very cross.
[11:24.48]Perfect.
[11:27.25]Okay, so...
[11:31.19]I have a lot of organs.
[11:35.01]Maybe I shouldn't use them all because then I can't use them for the other level up system.
[11:38.92]What's your favorite curse word?
[11:46.06]Probably.
[11:53.96]Probably fuck.
[12:14.79]I was thinking about whether or not I would do that or not.
[12:17.22]It took me a solid five to ten seconds, but I did it anyways.
[12:33.89]I hate myself.
[12:35.74]Alright, let's go.
[12:36.55]Whoa!
[12:37.11]I'm fine.
[12:42.39]Should I do all agility?
[12:44.30]I kind of need more curse tolerance.
[12:47.65]Not gonna lie.
[12:52.87]I actually do curse a little.
[13:00.26]I think I want to get health to 100.
[13:09.06]I need one more grease.
[13:25.05]Let's go.
[13:25.96]Alright.
[13:26.81]Now we have access to violence, dex, and weirdness.
[13:33.81]So this is effectively strength dex, uh, int.
[13:39.82]Okay.
[13:40.46]Base melee damage, which is then further multiplied by equipment effects.
[13:44.29]base projectile damage, and then base spell damage.
[13:49.62]Should I do... People are saying you should do weird maxing.
[13:53.20]Um, I don't know.
[13:54.27]I think I really want to do throw acid.
[14:02.97]We voted on this and then I just completely didn't do it.
[14:06.15]Weird maxing.
[14:07.77]How about throw maxing?
[14:14.78]Alright, now that you've seen the game a little bit, now that people have actually seen how it works, go ahead and put another poll up.
[14:24.44]I'm curious.
[14:25.10]I'm not going to abide by this at all.
[14:27.21]I'm just curious.
[14:27.94]You've seen how the game is.
[14:29.16]You've seen what's going on.
[14:30.51]We've got violence, throw acid, or spells.
[14:38.14]No, this actually could be a gun build too.
[14:40.69]I might do a shotgun with this.
[14:42.86]So this is either cleaver...
[14:45.63]or other melee shotgun or acid and then uh spells and effects
[15:02.02]I just want to confirm how correct I was with what I thought.
[15:10.69]Your character snowballs like crazy in this game too.
[15:12.66]So the game's not necessarily, oh my God, it's so hard.
[15:15.69]the hardest game, dude.
[15:17.27]It's like Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring Messmer fight combined into one game.
[15:24.88]No, the game's not particularly like, oh my god, it's so hard.
[15:27.49]It's just fun.
[15:37.07]The fun and the difficulty is more so kind of exploring.
[15:41.26]But game doesn't have to be excruciatingly difficult to be fun.
[15:45.64]Everybody knows that.
[15:48.71]Alright, so Magic won by 50%, but I'm gonna veto it, and I'm sorry everybody that voted for it.
[15:55.01]If Range got at least 30%, I was gonna do it.
[15:57.94]So it's time to throw acid and use like revolvers and stuff.
[16:06.59]I trolled everybody.
[16:09.15]Alright, we're gonna do Dex.
[16:10.21]Projectile damage, I'm doing it.
[16:11.90]I already made my decision and that's bad because now people are gonna be very upset.
[16:16.77]But hey, here's the thing.
[16:19.34]You could get your own copy of Withering Rooms.
[16:22.48]It's on Steam right now.
[16:25.03]If you want to check out magic in this game, I highly recommend you do so.
[16:32.74]I'm using up all my shit, because I want more.
[16:35.47]What was it, five?
[16:38.73]Four.
[16:38.89]Uh, Dex again.
[16:41.31]We're doing decks and agility.
[16:42.54]I want to be able to sprint around and throw stuff.
[16:49.61]And I did do magic last time.
[16:51.13]That's right.
[16:52.11]That's true.
[16:56.90]Alright, that's good for now.
[16:58.97]Well, now I have to actually lean into that.
[17:00.98]I can't walk around with a pipe anymore.
[17:02.27]I have to actually get materials and...
[17:05.64]Wait a minute, what is this?
[17:08.18]Wait just a second.
[17:10.54]What is that?
[17:12.43]Hey Samantha, in honor of Priscilla Mostyn's mechanical genius, please set the combination of the organ storage safe to the last three digits of her birth year
[17:23.08]Our organ operations would not be possible without her research.
[17:26.89]Though she has been missing from the dream for many years, we must not forget her contributions.
[17:31.16]Your initiates will think of her each time they open that safe.
[17:34.50]Your friend, Robert Baratheon.
[17:38.38]Okay, I have to go back to the mausoleum.
[17:42.43]The last three digits of her birth year.
[17:44.36]Priscilla's with a sister, right?
[17:47.68]Anybody take a screenshot of that?
[17:49.95]When we were down there?
[17:51.60]Anybody take a screenshot?
[17:55.43]Because that's a mausoleum.
[17:59.12]It's actually 985.
[18:00.35]No, it is not.
[18:07.27]I could check the VOD.
[18:09.13]Alright.
[18:10.43]Let's get a poll up in chat.
[18:12.10]Should we check the VOD to find out what that combination is, or should I go do it in the game?
[18:17.48]Let's get a quick poll.
[18:32.63]Okay, I think all the mods sat there for a second.
[18:35.43]They were like, I don't think we're doing this.
[18:38.42]I think he's just doing this for fun.
[18:47.16]Wow, dude, this is actually surprising.
[18:52.28]Do you get paid by the poll?
[18:53.88]You can actually do it, so you have to make people pay to vote, right?
[18:58.22]I remember seeing that before and I was like, that's fucking kind of crazy.
[19:02.36]That's kind of fucked up.
[19:09.51]It's channel points.
[19:10.79]I know.
[19:11.11]Oh, that is okay.
[19:12.06]It's not.
[19:13.53]You're doing paid polls.
[19:21.59]Oh shit, this is not... What do we do about this?
[19:24.93]I guess I would just decide at that point, right?
[19:36.84]Alright, well, I have to go to the mausoleum.
[19:38.95]What the hell?
[19:41.72]Where were the VOD checkers?
[19:43.21]Where were you guys?
[19:45.09]I fucking needed you.
[19:46.51]Now I have to go all the way back there.
[19:51.40]How did you- how could you guys have lost?
[19:52.58]51-49.
[19:56.30]I couldn't say I was rooting for you because that would put my thumb on the scale.
[20:02.26]The idol was more rarely brought out after the Roman Emperor Constantine turned Byzantium into his new capital.
[20:10.07]I can't even read Byzantium.
[20:12.26]It's possible it was increasingly viewed as dangerous or heretical.
[20:16.54]No record exists in the labyrinth after the Fourth Crusade in the early 13th century.
[20:21.76]It's unknown what happened to the idol in the ensuing... God damn it, man.
[20:30.20]I just can never wear two headphones for the rest of my life.
[20:32.52]But they're in, and you need them in for this game.
[20:36.48]Because I hear kind of like that game sound or that ambient room kind of sounds.
[20:42.59]I'm just going to like...
[20:46.96]a true actor and a true performance.
[20:51.66]He was in a quiet room surrounded by foam.
[20:57.32]with glasses on the brim of your nose and your hand in the air, curling all the fingers a little bit, curling your index finger and looking down and speaking.
[21:06.18]It's unknown what happened to the idol.
[21:09.03]You have to have your hand bent, your elbow at 90 degrees up, fingers up, curling while you talk.
[21:15.82]That's how you do it.
[21:19.59]Oh, he's doing that voice actor bit thing again.
[21:21.68]Yeah, sometimes you gotta repeat it.
[21:23.49]It's not the same people every stream.
[21:27.19]It's unknown what happened to the idol in the ensuing 600 years.
[21:30.80]Perhaps it was discreetly used by a single family, or perhaps it was simply sat covered in some moldering tomb.
[21:37.18]At some point it was discovered by a merchant who sold it to my brother, Peter Mostyn, in 1874.
[21:43.32]Peter brought it back to Mostyn House, and it was there I began to unravel the dream's mysteries.
[21:49.53]I was an outsider like yourself to begin with.
[21:56.13]Alright, mausoleum.
[21:57.06]I got to get cursed because then I can teleport.
[22:02.46]Alright, no more funny stuff.
[22:03.81]We're playing.
[22:05.90]He said funny.
[22:07.75]Laughing my ass off.
[22:12.13]Fuck up.
[22:19.89]OK, a mausoleum is we got to go back to here.
[22:29.05]Oh.
[22:38.77]That actually scared the fuck out of me.
[22:40.64]I did not expect anything to be here.
[22:43.82]That actually hurt me in real life.
[22:49.12]Can he come in here?
[22:53.27]Okay.
[22:54.62]Born 8-4-6.
[22:59.34]He sounded like a wizard who burnt his beard in a cauldron.
[23:02.20]Alright, born 8-4.
[23:11.83]Okay, 8-4-6.
[23:13.26]Don't fuck with a monster out here.
[23:15.07]This is not a scary game though, right?
[23:26.87]Wait, I was like, did I not activate that one?
[23:36.49]Where the hell was I?
[23:38.39]When was I?
[23:40.42]Here.
[23:42.81]Alright, 846.
[23:51.27]Permanent lab manual.
[23:54.28]Ooh!
[23:55.56]Advanced lab manual originally.
[23:57.65]It's even harder to talk when this game just does this in my head.
[24:02.27]Okay, let me try this again.
[24:05.38]Okay, incendiary jar, curse jar, elixir jar.
[24:09.45]Is there a cookie jar?
[24:12.75]Ooh.
[24:17.78]Permanently erase a foe from the dream.
[24:22.84]The rituals are following a room free of enemies, two vials of organ grease, and one warding candle.
[24:29.62]Oh, so you can permanently delete respawns.
[24:35.87]A gold cup filled with thick, viscous red fluid.
[24:41.25]Toxic to the living, but though careful processing its power.
[24:43.99]Ooh.
[24:46.68]Okay.
[24:48.86]That's it for this room.
[24:50.73]Alright.
[24:51.07]First, which is bedroom.
[24:52.90]I need to go up.
[24:54.02]So we're going to go to the upper east stairwell, go up.
[24:57.70]I should probably do a warding candle, but I wanted to do this specifically to get the item that's probably...
[25:03.38]I'm too jumpy to do anything.
[25:09.50]There it is.
[25:14.88]This is why I, like, had to stop drinking coffee.
[25:16.79]Because I would drink a coffee and it's just like...
[25:20.77]What's that sound?
[25:22.66]But I'm drinking a coffee right now, so like, I'm full of shit.
[25:27.16]Okay, no, don't do that.
[25:32.11]There's still something here.
[25:33.16]See the question mark?
[25:38.39]Luck charm.
[25:40.48]As long as it remains in your inventory, you get 25% luck.
[25:46.27]That's kind of crazy.
[25:49.83]Did I get everything?
[25:51.33]I hate when they do that.
[25:57.56]See the question mark?
[26:00.52]What the fuck is still here?
[26:13.59]Oh, here we go.
[26:16.18]Oh, another charm.
[26:17.18]Curse charm.
[26:18.59]That's good, too.
[26:19.95]Finally, I got it all.
[26:20.93]Alright.
[26:22.10]I can't, I'm, it's just, it's gonna, it's gonna happen every fucking ten seconds.
[26:28.37]This is clear.
[26:35.39]Alright, this is a dumb way to go, but...
[26:39.46]I kinda have to go this way.
[26:41.89]I'm not going up here with this much curse.
[26:44.64]That'd be crazy.
[26:50.29]Do you jump at your floorboards?
[26:52.93]No.
[26:55.82]It's unexpected...
[27:00.88]Alright, that was just somebody plugging in a guitar and testing it.
[27:03.53]That's just the sound that happens when people are testing their amps.
[27:09.21]Somebody just picked up an electric guitar.
[27:13.68]Okay.
[27:14.65]So we need to go this way.
[27:15.56]I'm just going to go this way.
[27:16.42]Whatever.
[27:17.71]Because I have to get the... Doll...
[27:23.18]Whatever.
[27:24.36]It's too dark in here.
[27:25.24]I need the lantern.
[27:26.62]Watch out for that.
[27:30.78]God.
[27:32.13]Okay, I can't see anything.
[27:34.24]But let's use fire!
[27:40.30]I can't go there.
[27:41.26]I'm gonna die.
[27:42.04]Oh my god, don't die.
[27:43.05]Don't die.
[27:43.47]I have so much stuff.
[27:44.90]Oh my, please!
[27:48.63]We have to go the other way.
[27:52.93]What was the plan there?
[27:53.88]I don't know.
[27:55.29]Faster.
[27:56.65]I don't know.
[27:58.22]What was the plan there?
[27:58.94]That was dumb.
[28:05.07]There's another thing that I didn't get.
[28:10.06]It's like Luigi's Mansion.
[28:11.45]I can't play it.
[28:12.94]Because if there's a question mark that says there's an item in this room, I freak out.
[28:16.42]I have to do everything before I get it.
[28:21.07]Where is the item in the room?
[28:25.61]Is it the clock?
[28:28.24]Oh.
[28:29.38]Nice.
[28:31.60]Alright, so I have to go down and then just teleport up.
[28:38.73]No, I don't get scared during Luigi's Mansion.
[28:40.97]I'm saying that I have to pick up everything and that every single thing can be vacuumed in that game.
[28:50.88]Okay.
[29:00.08]So I got to go in here.
[29:01.33]Why did I even do that?
[29:02.36]That was really stupid.
[29:03.91]I could just teleport right here.
[29:06.43]Okay.
[29:07.81]Where is she?
[29:11.42]Enchant.
[29:14.51]Let's do an enchantment.
[29:17.01]Okay!
[29:19.84]Can you... Can you... Ooh, you did it!
[29:25.43]Permanent curse ring.
[29:29.98]We have to go, we have to get across to the right side.
[29:32.21]That's the only way, I can't take her to the portal.
[29:35.16]Hey, turn this shit off and play Hello Neighbor.
[29:38.08]I'm actually going to direct the mods to give you like a 30 minute timeout.
[29:43.65]Because not only are you telling me to stop playing this game, which I love it and I'm having a great time, but you told me to play a different game that, uh,
[29:54.37]Guys, did we already do this?
[29:56.88]This is a Hello Neighbor animated show.
[29:59.37]And I was just like, I don't understand.
[30:02.79]I thought that game was still in alpha, and they've made 8 of them.
[30:10.67]I remember Hello Neighbor being in alpha.
[30:14.16]And it's like six years went by and it was like, we got Hello Neighbor alpha 1.01.
[30:19.98]And then I feel like I blinked and like a ton of media came out at the same time for that game.
[30:28.08]It was like, oh, Hello Neighbor, Alva, Alva, Alva, Alva, Alva, Hello Neighbor 2, Hello Neighbor 3, Hello to Secret Neighbor, Secret Neighbor versus the fucking Foxy from Five Nights at Freddy's.
[30:35.17]Five Nights at Freddy's versus Hello Neighbor.
[30:36.48]Hello Neighbor, the animated show.
[30:37.47]Hello Neighbor, the doll.
[30:38.84]You can buy it in real life.
[30:39.98]Hello Neighbor.
[30:41.11]The scent, hello neighbor, the cologne, smell just like the neighbor.
[30:45.73]I feel like this just fucking happened so quickly.
[30:47.40]I don't even understand when this happened.
[30:54.24]Alright, so can you still follow me?
[30:58.90]Come with me.
[31:04.09]Alright, we need to go...
[31:06.17]I have to take her, because I want to bring her to the other room, right?
[31:08.48]Where was that other thing to turn?
[31:14.76]Because if I go this way and we go down, where is that other thing to turn?
[31:19.02]We go here and then in, where is it?
[31:23.02]The parlor?
[31:28.72]There's another thing to turn.
[31:30.47]It's a witch's bedroom, right?
[31:36.21]Hello Neighbor, the Skibidi Neighbor versus Jason.
[31:44.98]I think it's down here.
[31:46.18]I'm just gonna go.
[31:47.01]We'll take her.
[31:48.39]I just- we have to stay alive and I have to kill everything in that room.
[31:51.33]So I'm- do I have acid?
[31:53.16]No, but we're gonna go make some.
[31:54.91]I need a lab.
[31:59.78]Okay, where's a lab?
[32:02.39]Laboratory workbench.
[32:03.44]Is there one up here?
[32:04.16]There is, okay.
[32:05.95]So down, we're gonna make a shitload of acid.
[32:09.91]Come with me.
[32:15.56]Alright, keep going.
[32:16.82]I hope there's nothing that spawns here.
[32:23.41]Oh, fuck, where are we?
[32:25.28]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:39.13]Give me the book.
[32:42.77]I want two summons here.
[32:45.20]Eat the scone.
[32:46.22]Now let's I'm ready to rumble.
[32:48.83]Wait, use this.
[32:51.62]Good.
[32:53.01]I'm ready, let's go.
[32:55.22]Turn the fucking lantern on, you idiot.
[33:05.70]Fight!
[33:07.81]Fight!
[33:14.98]Do you fight?
[33:16.97]Oh, he fell down.
[33:24.51]This guy has so much health!
[33:28.31]Okay.
[33:31.58]Caged ghoul.
[33:34.33]Oh my god, we gotta run.
[33:35.76]Just run.
[33:39.34]Are you alive?
[33:42.58]Oh, thank God.
[33:43.27]Okay, we're fine.
[33:44.21]Good.
[33:44.97]Close this.
[33:50.50]Oh, hell yeah.
[33:54.89]I definitely want to remember I got a new thing that was crazy.
[33:57.47]What was it?
[34:05.30]Yep.
[34:05.94]Oh, this is the one.
[34:07.07]I need that one.
[34:07.63]Keep that.
[34:08.65]Finally.
[34:09.96]It was in my inventory the whole time.
[34:11.96]Alright, so now if I go... Oh, fuck.
[34:17.28]What the hell?
[34:17.83]I might have screwed up big time here.
[34:22.63]That's massive.
[34:25.32]Curse Jar is curse damage.
[34:26.75]Tonic Jar is healing.
[34:28.03]I need more.
[34:29.95]Oh, I need to make acid.
[34:32.44]Okay, I need sulfuric acid.
[34:33.79]Somebody sells it.
[34:37.86]Incendiary jar.
[34:41.06]Cursed jar, might as well.
[34:48.33]Can we go this way?
[34:49.45]We can go this way, right.
[34:50.98]Alright, so what's through here?
[34:53.27]Perfect.
[34:57.16]Let me heal.
[35:05.51]Okay.
[35:06.90]So, I think if we go down, then...
[35:21.08]Don't- Stop looking at him.
[35:24.32]Crouch!
[35:32.32]Crouch!
[35:38.10]Upper banquet hall.
[35:39.27]Oh, fuck.
[35:39.85]This is a boss room.
[35:43.19]Hold on.
[35:44.66]This is the boss room.
[35:48.55]We're not ready for this.
[35:49.57]You have to go.
[35:51.86]Oh shit.
[35:53.56]Okay, wait a minute.
[35:55.90]Um...
[35:59.61]You need to go grind ghouls.
[36:01.23]I...
[36:09.28]Hold on.
[36:11.37]I said I was going to fix this entire inventory when I started again and we're doing that right now.
[36:14.79]We're taking a second here.
[36:17.00]Okay.
[36:19.49]Pipe.
[36:21.44]Slot 1.
[36:26.53]Projectile.
[36:28.18]Projectiles are going to be slot...
[36:30.63]Incendiary.
[36:34.24]All my throwables are going to be on here.
[36:36.79]You know what I'm saying?
[36:37.88]These are all my damage throwables because I'm going to be a throw guy.
[36:42.08]Also gonna put... That's technically defense.
[36:45.84]This is offense.
[36:46.59]Anything offense is going here.
[36:48.70]This is the offense category.
[36:53.31]I can get armor to protect us too.
[36:55.33]I'm going to do that.
[36:56.16]I'm not doing magic, but it's fine.
[37:01.56]Anything offense.
[37:05.69]That looks good to me.
[37:07.62]This is now defense.
[37:09.99]Defense only.
[37:12.35]Repeat it.
[37:13.92]Thank you.
[37:17.13]Defense Defense Defense
[37:27.82]Defense.
[37:33.95]I need a spot for the camera.
[37:37.72]I have one of these.
[37:38.58]Doesn't matter.
[37:41.52]Okay.
[37:42.72]Now it's heals.
[37:45.77]Heals and other healing devices.
[37:49.58]So we'll go like that.
[37:51.51]Is this bleed?
[37:53.01]This whole thing will be it.
[37:54.84]Okay.
[37:55.72]Rotten meat, it's fine.
[37:57.65]Cheese, it's fine.
[37:59.79]Health potions are going right up top.
[38:01.50]And get rid of this camera.
[38:04.91]Finally.
[38:06.39]My inventory isn't total dog shit anymore.
[38:11.52]Because now I can like, okay, switch to that.
[38:13.25]I got, now I can do this.
[38:14.15]Switch to the holy book.
[38:16.34]Bible, got it.
[38:20.10]Okay.
[38:23.59]I'm gonna try, we have to try to go back this way.
[38:28.97]Because I want to try to bring her down, because there's another thing to...
[38:31.22]I think it's downstairs, but I can't go.
[38:32.98]I have to...
[38:33.39]There's a boss.
[38:36.56]Alright, give me my acid.
[38:38.20]What do I have?
[38:41.91]incendiary jar.
[38:44.30]Alright, I'm gonna throw it.
[39:01.47]Run!
[39:02.59]Run!
[39:03.96]No!
[39:04.72]Run, run, run, run, run!
[39:07.03]Run!
[39:10.02]Run!
[39:13.81]Okay.
[39:18.14]This is no way.
[39:19.17]I can't do it.
[39:19.99]There's no way.
[39:20.59]I have to clear this whole attic.
[39:23.51]Look at all this shit that's in here, man.
[39:25.14]Like, there's no way.
[39:25.92]I have to come back here with like 10 grenades.
[39:30.96]Alright.
[39:31.46]Well, can you come back to nowhere?
[39:37.80]Because I have to fight the boss.
[39:44.03]I hope I don't get her killed.
[39:45.03]If I get her killed, is she gone forever?
[39:50.02]What happened to that candle there?
[39:59.45]She does come back to nowhere.
[40:00.62]Oh my god.
[40:03.15]Okay, well now I... That...
[40:06.84]I just got her almost killed for no reason.
[40:15.65]Keeping the bullet.
[40:18.70]Uh, I need jars.
[40:25.32]I'm not using these early.
[40:30.21]Do I give a shit about this?
[40:32.01]Probably.
[40:42.06]Ooh, he wants to buy this.
[40:44.25]That's a good picture.
[40:52.34]Okay.
[40:54.11]I have one of these plates.
[40:55.40]I think that's fine.
[40:56.24]I have plenty of candles.
[40:57.31]Alright.
[40:57.53]What about, doesn't Emma sell stuff too?
[41:03.48]Yes, she sells jars.
[41:05.26]Oh, yup.
[41:19.34]Let's make some missiles.
[41:34.41]Does it fit well as BRB music?
[41:37.17]This is my favorite track of them.
[41:38.05]There's actually, there's three or so are these?
[41:41.95]You'll see the next one is good too.
[41:45.48]In this same category, if you like how this one sounds.
[41:49.52]There's a couple of good ones.
[41:56.57]I need a lab.
[41:57.33]There's a lab right here.
[42:09.95]acid jar.
[42:16.83]This one's big too.
[42:17.74]I'm gonna save it though.
[42:18.86]Alright, I have five heals.
[42:21.99]Maybe six.
[42:24.18]I have ten throwing grenades.
[42:28.93]I gotta put those on the bar.
[42:39.92]Alright.
[42:40.64]I'm ready to throw shit at people.
[42:44.52]Something...
[42:45.74]Okay.
[42:53.82]So here's the question.
[42:56.37]Where was that other thing to turn?
[42:59.99]Because I'm going to get her killed.
[43:01.44]I might as well try to do this before I do the boss.
[43:05.72]Was it down here?
[43:06.61]I wish I could lock that into memory.
[43:08.57]Where was that?
[43:10.53]I want to say it was down here.
[43:13.12]Or it was up here.
[43:13.97]Which one was it?
[43:14.95]I remember where that was.
[43:15.84]It was like, oh, fuck, somebody can turn that.
[43:20.71]I don't remember.
[43:25.65]Was in a bedroom?
[43:31.84]Check that VOD.
[43:34.04]I guess I could just...
[43:34.70]I mean, I'm supposed to...
[43:35.59]I could look around.
[43:36.25]I don't want to get her killed, though, that's the problem.
[43:41.24]Robert's room?
[43:42.83]I think you're actually right.
[43:43.86]Yeah, you are right.
[43:44.79]It's Robert's room.
[43:45.74]There's one, but there's another one too.
[43:50.03]Alright, let's go.
[43:51.93]Upper parlor, Robert's room.
[43:54.42]We'll do that first.
[43:55.87]I just don't want to- I could go look for her, but I just don't want to get her killed.
[43:59.77]I don't know if she respawns.
[44:01.76]What the fuck are you doing?
[44:07.48]Alright, let's try not to die here.
[44:20.63]Let's try not to die.
[44:21.63]Yep.
[44:27.28]Here.
[44:30.09]Come here.
[44:35.65]Enter.
[44:40.36]Wait.
[44:43.74]Is there a fucking Aizabari monster in here?
[44:48.67]I don't feel safe without my lantern.
[44:54.64]I don't, I don't remember.
[44:55.58]I don't know what's up there.
[44:59.46]Celestial music.
[45:01.96]There's no greater sound than the human body playing transmissions from the cosmos.
[45:05.71]Each cluster of stars.
[45:07.17]I can't hear anything.
[45:08.68]I need to get rid of this.
[45:16.50]Clear that curse, please.
[45:20.23]Okay.
[45:22.88]Get that hand out of here.
[45:24.33]I'm not cursed anymore.
[45:31.00]Oh, bro.
[45:34.91]I hate this fucking backwards accordion music.
[45:43.96]I need to organ grease.
[45:48.82]I could search.
[45:51.04]There it is, okay.
[45:51.89]Entrance hall key.
[45:55.01]The key that unlocks the entrance hall, accessible from the west stairwell.
[45:59.79]Good.
[46:01.36]Alright, so we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, number after 6.
[46:06.43]So it's 6, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, number after 6.
[46:11.26]eight, nine.
[46:12.99]So that's six, nine, six,
[46:17.50]six nine six nine seven nine eight hold on one two one
[46:27.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, number after that one, 8, 9, 10.
[46:37.72]So it's 8, so it'd be... 7, 8?
[46:43.32]7, 8?
[46:45.63]8, 8?
[46:47.54]9-8 7-8 8-8 9-8 Right?
[46:52.55]7, 8.
[46:53.80]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8.
[47:02.32]Nine, eight.
[47:04.15]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[47:09.76]Nine.
[47:10.18]What was it?
[47:14.73]What was the last one?
[47:16.05]Fuck.
[47:16.72]Six, eight, seven.
[47:17.96]This whole dumb fucking meme has ruined me wanting to say that number out loud.
[47:24.53]And then 9, 8?
[47:25.18]7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8.
[47:31.57]Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[47:37.38]Hold on.
[47:42.88]Alright, seven, eight.
[47:45.97]Eight, eight, nine, eight.
[47:53.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8
[48:03.60]I don't think that's right.
[48:14.95]What is considered up on this one?
[48:20.78]Oh, wait a minute.
[48:21.94]Do I have to bring this down?
[48:23.49]Ah, quiet.
[48:26.77]I have to bring this...
[48:27.87]I have to do that in the...
[48:29.06]Okay, I get it.
[48:30.79]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[48:31.80]I have to look through the telescope...
[48:33.67]and see how many stars are in each one of where these are.
[48:39.79]Then I, whatever, how many stars are there?
[48:41.49]I bring it up and I hit the button there.
[48:43.59]It's literally, it's three keys.
[48:46.88]That's celestial music, right?
[48:49.32]Oh, each cluster of stars, a single note.
[48:52.37]Yeah.
[48:53.33]Alright.
[48:53.99]So, I want...
[48:55.38]I'm gonna take a mental screenshot of this.
[48:57.00]I want everyone else to take a mental screenshot.
[49:00.30]Write it down.
[49:01.00]I don't have...
[49:03.34]I want a mental screenshot of this.
[49:05.85]But what I mean by that is I want, wait, one of the mods, take a mental screenshot of this.
[49:10.89]There it is.
[49:15.76]I just looked over, it's in the mod chat.
[49:20.01]Appreciate that.
[49:23.05]I took a mental screenshot of it.
[49:29.44]Alright, then we can come back here later.
[49:31.95]I did get the key.
[49:33.66]So what is through?
[49:34.26]Oh, this is the secret attic where anything else in here I can touch.
[49:42.76]Not quite this.
[49:44.32]Alright.
[49:45.14]What is through here then?
[49:48.34]This is the attic hallway.
[49:49.38]Alright.
[49:50.97]I am ready.
[49:54.50]Let's do the first witch.
[49:55.71]I don't know how to make her leave me alone, but I guess it is what it is.
[50:01.09]What the hell was that?
[50:02.56]Why were you a different person for a second?
[50:05.22]What was that all about?
[50:06.77]What was that?
[50:08.05]That was weird.
[50:11.02]Why were you like a ghoul?
[50:18.45]I don't know what happened, but that was the perfect place for us to test this.
[50:27.73]No, I don't want to use that on some random enemy.
[50:43.40]That thing sucks.
[50:47.81]Oh, it scales off of luck.
[50:52.82]That goes up if you have higher luck, I guess.
[50:59.32]That was a throw for... You know what?
[51:08.26]Fucking hate these guys.
[51:09.29]I'm a projectile user.
[51:14.33]I'm not even supposed to be doing this.
[51:27.70]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[51:31.36]Feels like you don't like anything in this game.
[51:32.89]This game is amazing.
[51:39.65]Okay.
[51:43.90]I think we might have to be permanently injured.
[51:46.57]But that means if I get hit once, I die.
[51:48.24]50% projectile.
[51:49.86]That could kill bosses in like probably three hits.
[51:55.31]I love this game.
[51:56.81]I love how weird and creepy it is.
[52:02.13]Should I try to do that?
[52:03.81]Or is that a disaster in the making, you think?
[52:16.10]Don't worry, you never get hit though.
[52:17.72]That's true.
[52:19.77]That's true.
[52:20.25]I actually don't really get hit that much.
[52:24.36]What's in here?
[52:30.29]Why do they have to be inside those things?
[52:33.97]I actually am going to use this.
[52:35.38]Let's see how good it is.
[52:40.92]Yeah.
[52:42.37]It can blow up in my face, but that's fine.
[52:51.84]Fix your audio?
[52:52.70]What's wrong with my audio?
[52:55.67]What happened to my audio?
[52:59.57]Are you talking about the whooshing sound?
[53:05.19]I think that's in the game.
[53:05.98]You're talking about like the...
[53:15.31]There's a grating voice in the background of the game.
[53:24.78]I got a new item too.
[53:26.33]I got two things.
[53:27.29]I was too busy getting one guy there.
[53:28.94]What did I get?
[53:31.33]Alright.
[53:35.23]Probably the max health.
[53:38.94]That's a huge amount of max health.
[53:42.64]That's a lot of luck.
[53:56.25]That's good That's kinda good
[54:07.54]Do I try the less...
[54:09.95]Okay, I want this one.
[54:10.65]15%.
[54:11.07]Uh...
[54:13.89]Alright, this is more projectile damage and speed.
[54:16.52]This thing's probably gonna never come off.
[54:18.04]It's permanently on my finger.
[54:20.71]Do I try this one and just get myself killed over and over again?
[54:30.98]I won't do it yet.
[54:32.57]I feel like you kind of, I need more defense items.
[54:37.20]But, cool.
[54:38.59]Alright.
[54:39.23]There's still something in here.
[54:43.89]I think this kills you.
[54:46.94]I actually think this kills you if you go in it.
[54:51.58]I'm not testing that right now.
[54:52.48]I have way too much stuff.
[54:59.09]I think this is clear.
[55:04.81]Yeah, but it's really funny though.
[55:07.48]That's debatable.
[55:10.23]Okay.
[55:11.03]Secret attic room is where the, uh, piano is.
[55:13.14]We have to go... We have the key now to the entrance hall.
[55:17.14]We can do the witch.
[55:21.28]You know what?
[55:21.77]I think I'm gonna clear.
[55:23.30]What if I die, though?
[55:24.04]It would be a waste.
[55:26.31]Alright, we're gonna prepare for the witch.
[55:31.24]Okay, she does not permanently die.
[55:32.80]She is here, so we can do that later.
[55:33.99]That's good to know.
[55:45.65]Let's go back to nowhere.
[55:52.12]Can you do the cat puke sound?
[55:53.26]I forget what it sounds like.
[55:55.77]Um, so do I, dude.
[55:57.46]I can't help you there.
[55:58.48]I don't even know how, I don't remember even how to do it.
[56:12.65]I wanna buy up some stuff.
[56:16.96]Alright, you have some weird shit too, don't you?
[56:29.49]That's crazy.
[56:32.92]That is definitely a almost... You don't take any damage from anything.
[56:38.62]I'm just seeing if he has any projectile things.
[56:42.20]You could do a tank build with this, that's cool.
[56:45.37]It's melee damage.
[56:47.03]Alright, we need cheese.
[56:51.09]and I'll take another scone and should I sell?
[56:59.08]We.
[56:59.62]Did I say we, cat puke, or riot?
[57:11.85]There you go.
[57:16.16]I literally just drank some coffee.
[57:20.64]We didn't even hear it.
[57:25.38]Somebody heard it.
[57:29.55]I'm selling all the melee shit that I don't need.
[57:39.04]I hate getting rid of stuff though.
[57:43.70]I hate getting rid of stuff.
[57:47.81]Because what if I need it at some point?
[58:01.34]What if she's just carrying around a bullet?
[58:05.93]Alright, I'm ready.
[58:09.98]I've stalled long enough for the boss fight.
[58:12.00]The bosses are not that difficult either, though.
[58:16.26]I'd say the bosses are more of a sort of a kind of a like chapter complete point than they are of dude, it's fucking crazy.
[58:25.01]What do I need?
[58:28.56]Go get one of these.
[58:29.15]Go get two of those, actually.
[58:42.49]Hey, do you get banned if you talk badly about this game?
[58:45.62]Um...
[58:49.47]Yeah, you get banned if you're just fucking irritating.
[58:52.86]So don't worry.
[58:56.31]You can talk freely, but just don't be irritating.
[59:04.03]Alright, let's cure the curse and I'm gonna go fight the witch.
[59:20.08]You've banned people for not liking Gremlins 2.
[59:23.40]Yeah.
[59:24.31]Irritating.
[59:34.73]Kind of almost out of these.
[59:39.63]Alright, we're going in with the book.
[59:42.56]I want the possession book.
[59:44.29]Should I go in there with a bunch of friends?
[59:45.74]Okay, I'm just going to use the possession book.
[59:48.81]Because I don't know how hard she actually even is.
[59:56.20]Okay, so I gotta go here.
[60:01.79]What about my actual...
[60:05.31]Max health.
[60:07.64]It's gonna blend in.
[60:09.40]Poison build up.
[60:10.14]I'll take the...
[60:13.21]I think the max health is fine.
[60:14.43]OK, this is what I have on poise paralysis bleed.
[60:21.73]That one's good too.
[60:28.27]I kind of think this one's good though.
[60:32.18]It's kind of a little bit of everything.
[60:34.27]Okay.
[60:37.47]And might as well make a couple more acid.
[60:42.62]Alright.
[60:43.96]I'm ready to fight the witch.
[60:52.25]Do you actually stand up?
[60:55.99]Oh.
[60:59.70]removes the illusory wooden planks blocking access between the upper floor and the ground floor,
[61:05.11]Ah, this is how you clear it.
[61:06.86]You can clear one of those.
[61:07.60]That's good.
[61:08.43]He's gonna get up though.
[61:10.16]I guess not.
[61:10.64]Alright, you ready?
[61:11.99]If I die, I die.
[61:12.67]Whatever.
[61:23.35]People probably do runs where it's like, dude, I don't even turn on the candle.
[61:36.37]Oh, Nightingale, whatever are you doing out of the observatory?
[61:40.25]I know it must be boring.
[61:41.66]I promise as soon as Dr. Blackett completes his business he will explain everything.
[61:46.28]You've done phenomenally well here in the dream.
[61:48.75]It'd be such a shame for things to start going poorly now, wouldn't it?
[61:53.51]So please turn around and head back up to the observatory like a good girl.
[61:59.23]I don't know if you know this or not, but I learned how to make fucking jars of acid.
[62:06.40]Since you seem unable to follow such a simple command,
[62:09.19]I'll have to return you to the observatory myself.
[62:17.19]Yeah.
[62:23.85]Dude, this build is the way to go.
[62:26.26]It's so good.
[62:33.22]Oh shit, what if I run out of jars?
[62:34.78]Uh-oh!
[62:49.99]No!
[62:50.43]I'm going to run out of jars.
[62:51.82]How many do I have?
[62:52.98]I used them all?
[62:53.70]I have one jar left.
[63:06.55]I need to cure this rot.
[63:24.15]Don't you dare.
[63:36.48]Fuck.
[63:37.73]What, are you selling bugs?
[63:44.55]Why am I holding a lantern?
[63:47.20]Fuck.
[64:01.03]I almost just curse routed myself.
[64:05.16]No!
[64:05.60]No!
[64:17.03]Okay, uh, I can't throw anything else at her.
[64:20.66]I'm gonna just whack her.
[64:35.05]Trying to heal as much of that as I can.
[64:36.22]I got plenty of cheese in my inventory, don't worry.
[64:45.31]Oh, goodness.
[64:49.62]Oh, I can't touch those.
[64:51.55]Should I hit them?
[65:01.14]I don't have any more things to throw.
[65:02.52]Do I have any throwing knives?
[65:10.41]Curse Ball.
[65:11.19]Does that count as a...
[65:11.95]I guess that... Maybe that counts?
[65:17.70]I...
[65:18.24]I... Uh-oh.
[65:20.57]This is the last candle.
[65:21.47]I need to clear all the curse or I'm gonna die.
[65:31.06]What the fuck, dude, it bounced off the guy's back!
[65:43.74]No!
[65:44.28]I just cleared it all.
[65:46.96]You can't get hit by anything.
[65:55.46]You could go so far with it.
[65:57.47]I have to kill her.
[66:06.87]I can't clear the curse.
[66:22.65]Drink!
[66:24.21]Drink!
[66:30.91]I think we're gonna do it.
[66:38.92]Hit her, please!
[66:41.49]Get this fucking button!
[66:49.84]What the fuck, I'm poisoned?
[66:53.17]I'm taking so much tick damage, it's insane.
[66:57.35]I'm gonna lose.
[67:00.84]Turn what?
[67:01.46]I'm holding a fucking lantern.
[67:02.85]Turn it on at least, you idiot.
[67:10.79]Oh shit!
[67:14.22]Okay.
[67:19.86]I need to run.
[67:20.78]I need to click.
[67:23.41]I'm going to die from the curse.
[67:28.75]Okay, Organ Grease, good.
[67:31.10]This is the first witch.
[67:41.57]Do I have anything to heal?
[67:43.68]Wait.
[67:44.75]I'm invincible, right?
[67:47.56]Okay, hold on.
[67:49.06]Give me a second.
[68:02.06]Am I invincible right now?
[68:03.97]I can't use it when I'm suffering from Curse Rod.
[68:06.09]Fuck me.
[68:06.64]I'm dead.
[68:08.08]I'm dead.
[68:09.08]Um...
[68:13.96]Ah!
[68:20.04]I have cheese or anything?
[68:24.10]No!
[68:31.37]Oh, fuck!
[68:32.85]Eat, quick!
[68:41.62]Sit in the chair quick.
[68:43.34]Sit.
[68:49.13]You almost had a himbo death.
[68:53.31]It's alright.
[69:03.55]Alright.
[69:05.78]Very cool.
[69:06.48]I couldn't even use this because you're curse rodded.
[69:11.10]So now...
[69:13.76]Cool.
[69:15.89]Uh, find a way into the entrance hall.
[69:20.09]Which I have the access there now.
[69:23.79]Find an initiate's grimoire in the First Witch's bedroom.
[69:29.07]That's where that thing is!
[69:37.83]Okay.
[69:39.68]That's where the turn thing is.
[69:41.87]Remember I was asking about it?
[69:45.81]OK, let me just heal up.
[69:48.89]I'm actually kind of running out of a lot of things.
[70:00.74]I might have to do a reset so I can buy some more stuff.
[70:05.94]Because I'm out of almost everything.
[70:15.98]I'm gonna buy your whole store of those.
[70:23.05]Whip is cool.
[70:23.88]Wait a minute.
[70:24.42]Spell damage.
[70:26.46]Spell toll.
[70:28.29]No.
[70:33.99]I'm gonna- I need them eventually, right?
[70:35.37]Might as well just buy the whole store.
[70:38.05]Alright, now I need a lab.
[70:43.86]Oh, there's a lab here.
[70:48.60]Where's the lab here?
[70:57.61]Maybe there's not.
[71:10.03]Is she a lab?
[71:13.77]It says there's a lab here.
[71:14.69]It's weird.
[71:23.68]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[71:26.28]Sorry.
[71:31.53]There we go.
[71:37.46]Fill those jaws back up.
[71:43.66]So now I've got some things I could do.
[71:47.70]Right.
[71:48.69]Let me take a look at that screenshot.
[71:53.45]So this was seven, eight, right?
[71:56.32]Seven.
[71:56.76]So no, no, no, it was...
[72:03.24]7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8.
[72:04.60]7, 8.
[72:10.81]Which is 1.
[72:15.67]eight, eight, which is four.
[72:17.54]So one, four,
[72:23.27]149 is the keys?
[72:25.74]149?
[72:30.48]Because do you go up first or do you go right first?
[72:40.28]I'm pretty sure it's 149.
[72:45.80]We'll try it.
[72:46.67]We can always just come back.
[72:51.43]and that was the secret attic.
[72:57.22]Uh, I don't want to get cursed, so I'm just gonna... No, this guy's not gonna hurt me.
[73:01.49]I've got acid.
[73:08.11]Dude, this is so much better now.
[73:12.66]I could probably clear that crazy room.
[73:15.96]If I really wanted to.
[73:23.95]Alright, one, four, nine.
[73:29.01]One.
[73:31.20]Four.
[73:34.36]Shit.
[73:50.43]That didn't work.
[73:56.21]So is it right first, then up?
[74:18.15]That's probably right then, up.
[74:21.75]Okay, if that's the case then, it would be...
[74:23.31]Instead of 7, 8, it would be...
[74:26.73]one one two three four five six seven eight nine so be nine
[74:35.13]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 7.
[74:40.49]Which is 3.
[74:43.15]Nine, seven.
[74:44.07]Nine, eight.
[74:48.98]Three, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[74:52.00]So three, nine.
[74:54.01]the nine nine three nine three nine six let's try that three nine six
[75:07.87]If this ain't it then I have no idea.
[75:09.00]This is definitely it.
[75:29.55]Yeah.
[75:34.33]That's with all the red door in the basement.
[75:37.42]What do you mean beneath the basement?
[75:40.18]and a fireball spell.
[75:44.74]I have done as you asked.
[75:46.93]The holes in my head have been drilled precisely.
[75:50.42]Yet I still cannot hear you.
[75:52.35]Is there some adjustment that must be made to your transmitter?
[75:56.17]I am ready to receive your commands, my dearest.
[75:59.32]In the meanwhile, I have loaded the idol into the passageway beneath the entrance hall, as you've requested.
[76:04.34]I'm sure it has already started its journey to you.
[76:10.66]What the... Holy shit, the red door, dude.
[76:17.90]One day, we're going to find out what's in that basement.
[76:21.89]The basement, the key, the bread door in the basement, Aaron.
[76:28.36]Season five, episode 10, we're going in the basement.
[76:33.85]Season 7 Episode 9 The Basement Looms Don't go in that basement, you rotten little shit!
[76:42.14]Oh, go in it!
[76:43.62]I'm gonna open the door now.
[76:44.72]My hand is turning the knob.
[76:47.45]Season 11, episode four.
[76:50.28]The red knob burnt my hand.
[76:57.10]I remember that shit.
[76:58.12]I remember I was so annoyed with that.
[76:59.87]That was just like, man, go in there.
[77:01.90]Take that key and fucking go in there.
[77:05.96]Go.
[77:06.26]Season one, episode one.
[77:08.65]I'm going to open the door.
[77:09.93]We didn't even know.
[77:10.70]What the fuck was that?
[77:13.51]Just go in there.
[77:17.35]Okay, that was the spoiler room, right?
[77:20.80]He had the key to all the spoilers.
[77:22.55]That was the Wikipedia page for Attack on Titan was in the basement.
[77:26.43]It was open on a computer.
[77:28.17]Literally, it was open on a computer screen.
[77:30.06]A laptop was just on wikipedia.com.
[77:32.85]Attack on Titan, all seasons.
[77:34.53]Synopsis.
[77:36.35]I guess if you know, you can just do that.
[77:39.48]He just didn't want to spoil the whole show for himself.
[77:43.42]Alright, let's go.
[77:52.96]I didn't get a bunch of shit here because I freaked out.
[78:02.52]Did I pick up everything?
[78:04.35]Okay.
[78:07.36]Okay, I need to get cursed because there's still something.
[78:09.47]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[78:14.52]What the fuck?
[78:15.06]Is this what withering rooms looks like?
[78:16.95]See, you didn't trust me.
[78:20.73]You didn't trust me.
[78:26.27]So now we're back to here.
[78:27.45]This is the balcony.
[78:28.06]We unlock the door.
[78:28.76]We can get there anytime we want.
[78:34.23]I do want to go to the bedroom.
[78:36.83]Because I want to open this.
[78:43.48]Yeah.
[78:44.10]Okay, let me go.
[78:44.69]Let me just do this.
[78:45.25]I'll forget if I don't do this now.
[78:57.82]It's home alone watching season.
[79:07.36]Okay, I could remove the illusion.
[79:08.95]Can I do it from both or do I have to pick one?
[79:13.28]I think I can do it to both.
[79:14.15]So this goes down to... Hey, look at that.
[79:17.99]Look at all these connections we're making now.
[79:19.96]Because now this goes into the... Yep.
[79:23.09]Entrance hall.
[79:23.69]Oh boy.
[79:24.11]That's a...
[79:24.60]I'm not going in there yet.
[79:27.42]Remove the dust from both walls.
[79:30.46]banquet there's that big scary guy in there we're not doing that
[79:34.96]Now reading the map is a little bit easier because now you can kind of see how it all connects.
[79:39.12]So, boink, boink.
[79:40.61]We need to go up.
[79:41.53]So we need to go up to the attic.
[79:44.36]grab from Priscilla's storage room, the doll, back down here, right?
[79:50.60]First, which is bedroom.
[80:03.69]What's your favorite episode of Malcolm in the Middle?
[80:05.60]The one where Hank is skating.
[80:09.01]Where he shows his rollerblading abilities and does this whole rollerblading arc.
[80:16.87]That's up there for sure.
[80:23.28]Do I even have one of those spells?
[80:27.09]Alright, let's go.
[80:50.67]Another favorite is when he's talking about minerals, when he loves minerals and stuff.
[80:55.33]And he starts talking to Hank, and he's like...
[80:58.26]And then I think Malcolm is in an episode too.
[81:00.75]When Malcolm like breaks his collection of minerals.
[81:03.94]And Hank's like, these minerals, right?
[81:12.81]He ends up in the rollerblading episode, he crashes into him, knocks over the whole case.
[81:22.81]You still with me?
[81:27.25]Good.
[81:32.14]Now go pull that lever while I get items.
[81:36.62]This one.
[81:42.74]There it is.
[81:43.32]Oh, now I know how to make a fireball.
[81:49.26]Right.
[81:49.83]Very right.
[81:50.61]Okay.
[81:52.31]Excellent.
[81:53.76]I'm going to do some leveling up because, you know, fuck you.
[81:59.84]Not you.
[82:00.40]Who do you think I was talking to?
[82:19.29]Okay, I can do doot doot doot.
[82:22.54]Doot doot doot doot doot.
[82:27.68]I need money.
[82:30.82]I'm selling my whole inventory.
[82:32.89]I've made my decision.
[82:38.59]Okay.
[82:39.54]What do I want to get rid of?
[82:42.04]I'm really not going to be doing spells that much.
[82:47.24]Okay, I don't...
[82:49.92]I think that's all I want to sell.
[82:52.10]No, this too.
[83:05.87]I'm not gonna be making spells, I'm not.
[83:10.92]Maybe there's a dust pouch.
[83:16.03]I haven't used this once, but it's only worth like one coin.
[83:26.62]I have enough money to level up like once or twice.
[83:36.19]Okay.
[83:42.00]Okay, I could do all in on Dex.
[83:49.81]What about maybe more immunity?
[83:53.32]No, I want 100 health.
[83:58.64]I wasn't saying this game looked bad, by the way.
[84:00.39]I like the art style, I just got the name confused with an anime game.
[84:05.69]Oh, that's it.
[84:06.54]Okay, I maxed out this machine.
[84:08.39]I can't use this machine anymore.
[84:09.38]I maxed it out.
[84:21.70]Wuthering waves.
[84:24.76]Withering realms, withering rooms, withering waves.
[84:30.84]Yeah, that's true.
[84:31.56]Wuthering rooms.
[84:45.31]Play Wuthering Waves on stream and we will watch it.
[84:50.57]I don't think very many of you want to see me play that, but
[84:56.45]Remember, we're in this period where I don't, I'm just doing whatever it is.
[85:00.09]If I liked it, I wouldn't have played it.
[85:02.91]Then we would, you know, you would have to be subject to that.
[85:06.99]Or you could just leave.
[85:09.28]You know, that's the thing.
[85:10.25]You could just leave.
[85:15.86]You're in your fuckface era?
[85:17.40]No, I'm in my...
[85:22.37]I'm in my who?
[85:23.94]What?
[85:24.26]Nice.
[85:26.98]Whatever.
[85:33.91]I have so many rings.
[85:36.74]Alright, what's on the schedule?
[85:40.30]Oh, I wanna use the door handle and the red door in the basement.
[85:42.21]That's exactly what I wanna do.
[85:56.29]What the f- Oh, he scared the shit out of me, man.
[86:00.59]I see you found some bloody thread.
[86:03.58]I have some skill with a needle and thread.
[86:05.99]If you have an outfit you'd like me to strengthen, the service is free of charge.
[86:09.77]Such rare, beautiful thread is a true pleasure to work with.
[86:13.06]Oh, he upgrades stuff.
[86:14.44]Alright.
[86:14.98]I don't think I have anything I really want to commit to yet.
[86:20.32]Remember, we're doing projectiles.
[86:21.85]That includes guns and jars.
[86:33.31]Nothing is standing out to me for that exact thing.
[86:42.46]This is the luck dress.
[86:48.71]This one's not bad.
[86:54.96]Hmm.
[86:56.53]I'm not committing to anything yet.
[86:58.46]Please play Darkwood 2.
[86:59.87]Oh my god.
[87:06.13]Uhm, I don't know man.
[87:14.47]Hold on, there's something in here.
[87:17.90]What else is in here?
[87:19.22]Is one of the... You piece of shit!
[87:23.44]Are you serious?
[87:26.38]Alright, back up, back up, back up.
[87:27.83]I don't want to throw acid at you.
[87:29.86]Please move.
[87:30.33]Move!
[87:33.47]I don't want to throw acid at you!
[87:35.36]I threw acid in your face!
[87:36.85]Stop, what is wrong with you?
[87:45.94]There's something in here.
[87:49.61]What's in here?
[87:53.22]That was it?
[87:53.98]Really?
[87:54.20]I just got hurt for no reason.
[88:02.83]There's other shit in here too.
[88:04.54]Did I not clear this all out?
[88:06.53]I guess not.
[88:10.58]No, I died and I came back.
[88:11.91]Right, that's what it was.
[88:17.79]Still something in here.
[88:18.99]Alright, there it is.
[88:24.99]Rickety stairwell.
[88:36.82]the labyrinth entrance.
[88:47.06]Labyrinth Camp A cowboy hat.
[88:53.22]Oh, it's too bad it's melee.
[88:56.72]I definitely did not see this in the playthrough I did before.
[89:01.59]Like I said, I think most of the stuff is scattered each night.
[89:04.42]10 health vampirism added to melee.
[89:13.03]Oh man, wait a second.
[89:19.07]Uh, yep.
[89:24.19]Adventurer's outfit.
[89:31.26]Cool.
[89:33.00]That was, the other one was not, it was melee only.
[89:35.75]Well, it looks cool.
[89:45.96]Okay, well, that's projectile.
[89:52.38]I love how the doll is still here.
[89:55.21]Alright, here's another one of these.
[89:56.17]This is ancient blood to use this one.
[90:02.55]I'm glad I didn't use it.
[90:03.57]Hello.
[90:06.70]Oh, I was not expecting someone.
[90:11.04]Nobody's been down to check on our progress in ages.
[90:14.66]I am Josette, leader of this expedition into the Ancient Labyrinth.
[90:18.79]I'm afraid things haven't been going so well lately.
[90:21.46]I've fallen ill from breathing the vapors present in the bottom floor.
[90:26.76]As such, I'm unable to keep the filthy wretches' automatons going and progress has stopped.
[90:35.55]I'm sure I'll be feeling better soon.
[90:38.66]If Robert or the First Witch have a problem with our progress, I must insist they visit themselves.
[90:45.16]In the meanwhile, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.
[90:49.51]I'll be back.
[90:58.00]more look at all these spells fireball was fireball was fire dude
[91:09.10]I remember the Fireball was good.
[91:12.61]Summon Spears, Possession Book, Burning Protection Book, Healing Barrier, you can heal.
[91:19.55]I actually might make these even though I'm not doing magic.
[91:27.38]Hello.
[91:29.57]Oh, ah.
[91:30.93]Must have nodded off.
[91:32.02]My apologies.
[91:34.08]It has been so long since we've had a visitor from above.
[91:37.30]Welcome to our humble camp.
[91:39.57]I'm Albert, guard of Moston House.
[91:42.65]Or at least I used to be.
[91:44.66]You must have met my brother, David, upstairs.
[91:47.95]He's the groundskeep.
[91:49.42]Usually wears yellow.
[91:52.33]How's my brother?
[91:55.57]He's fine.
[91:56.18]I don't want to say he's a zombie.
[91:57.66]That's horrible.
[91:58.64]He's fine.
[92:00.93]Wonderful to hear.
[92:01.63]I was afraid he might have become one of those shambling monsters.
[92:06.88]Were I not watching Josette, I would pay him a visit myself.
[92:11.52]Beyond this room lies an ancient Byzantine temple.
[92:15.02]It is chock full of traps and leathery old undead.
[92:18.44]You need to keep your wits about you.
[92:21.15]There are wonderful treasures to be found.
[92:23.99]For example, I found this beautiful suit of armor hidden away in a chest.
[92:28.77]If you need any survival tips, I'm your man.
[92:31.60]Additionally, I have a small set of supplies which I can provide at cost.
[92:35.66]You may be particularly interested in the portable crafting kit.
[92:38.47]I'd offer to come with you, but my duty lies here with Josette.
[92:42.06]One more thing.
[92:43.47]That chamber over there operates on ancient blood.
[92:47.03]Here's an offering list for what it requires.
[92:51.21]He's got some good...
[92:52.52]I need that.
[92:52.96]75 tokens.
[92:55.37]75 arcade Chuck E. Cheese tokens.
[93:00.17]For that, okay.
[93:04.04]Curious statue.
[93:08.63]Oh, it just gives you curse.
[93:12.96]Throwing knives, though, that's kind of...
[93:14.75]I should do it.
[93:18.30]The plus three is from the stat points.
[93:28.00]That's pretty good.
[93:34.41]Show me your report card for free tokens.
[93:35.90]I never got that.
[93:38.71]I've told that story before.
[93:40.08]I would go with my siblings and
[93:43.86]Because back in the day, if you had a good report card, Chuck E. Cheese gave you 20 or something free tokens.
[93:48.86]It was actually a crazy deal.
[93:52.50]But my report card during those years was not great.
[93:56.29]And my siblings was good though.
[93:59.12]So my mother and father would take us.
[94:01.56]It's like, oh yeah, here are the report cards.
[94:04.30]And they kind of would just give the, like, oh,
[94:06.69]A's and B's, you get 20 tokens.
[94:09.82]B's, you get 15 tokens.
[94:12.29]But I was always like, C's?
[94:14.12]I don't know if they had a policy where you had to have good grades, but
[94:19.52]They kind of bundled us together.
[94:21.39]I was like, oh, okay, well, a couple of your kids are smart.
[94:25.15]So I guess we'll give you the tokens.
[94:27.26]That's fine.
[94:29.46]He didn't do so good, but he brought in two other smart kids.
[94:32.65]So I think that's fine.
[94:37.86]That's nepotism.
[94:41.35]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[94:42.30]I was a part of Chuck E. Cheese token nepotism from my smarter siblings.
[94:48.60]Yeah.
[94:51.48]You played too much Chrono Trigger.
[94:54.92]That's kind of actually potentially true.
[94:58.33]No, I'll tell you what it was.
[94:59.98]It wasn't video games.
[95:01.84]It was staying up and... Dude, this is how fucked up things used to be.
[95:05.88]I know I've told this before, like years ago, maybe.
[95:08.30]but there was no such thing as an iPhone.
[95:12.44]There's no such thing as a iPad or small laptops or whatever.
[95:17.08]So I remember WWF Raw, Raw is war, would be on way past my bedtime.
[95:24.05]And I think it started at like 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.
[95:27.56]It went to like midnight sometimes.
[95:29.08]It went to like 10, 11, 12 o'clock.
[95:32.11]crazy for like a network television show to go that late, right?
[95:36.86]But I remember
[95:37.80]I had a little TV that was a small, big, heavy ass, big tube TV.
[95:42.97]and it sat right next to my bed.
[95:46.67]So it was close enough to my bed where I could kind of just turn
[95:49.33]It was like just a little shitty TV, but it was a big ass, by today's standards, it was huge.
[95:54.23]It had to have been probably 14, 15.
[95:55.50]It was that VCR combo TV they had for many years.
[95:58.17]But sometimes I would have it on too late and trying to make it so my parents didn't know I was still watching
[96:05.66]Sometimes I would even hold the TV in the bed.
[96:08.17]It would be in the bed with me.
[96:10.16]And I would have to cover it with the covers when I'd hear somebody coming.
[96:13.73]So I'd have this gigantic like cement block in my bed with me, just like the cord on it, covering the covers when I hear somebody coming.
[96:21.71]And
[96:22.66]It didn't, sometimes it just didn't work.
[96:25.03]I remember one time just my mother being like, stop that, stop doing that.
[96:32.04]And she moved it away from the bed.
[96:33.85]Like she pulled the table away.
[96:35.05]So like if the table had moved, she would know that I was doing that.
[96:40.37]But yeah, it was different, man.
[96:41.60]Like, I remember, like, seeing Hulk Hogan and shit, and like, oh, there's the Undertaker and all, like, mankind, oh!
[96:46.96]And it was just, I was cradling like a 16 pound baby in my hands.
[96:52.79]like on my chest and like neck and left part of my arms, like holding it, cradling it, just with the thought that I could just cover it with the covers.
[97:02.50]CRT radiation.
[97:07.04]Yeah, it was so much more difficult.
[97:08.49]But yeah, that's what was the problem.
[97:11.53]It's me watching too much Undertaker.
[97:16.26]My favorite was the Ultimate Warrior though.
[97:18.41]Macho Man, Randy Savage, Ultimate Warrior.
[97:21.84]The Ultimate Warrior, he was so just jazzed up and jacked up every time.
[97:26.09]He would sprint out to the ring.
[97:27.62]You know when the music plays?
[97:29.36]It's like, here comes the wrestler, and they're gonna walk down, and hey, there's a fan, and there's a fan.
[97:35.66]He did not do any of that.
[97:36.94]He literally sprinted to the ring every time he was ever introduced.
[97:40.82]It took him four seconds to get down there.
[97:42.22]He just ran straight into the ring.
[97:44.67]He did not care.
[97:51.96]He had so much energy.
[97:53.22]Yeah, I... That era of wrestling was fucking crazy.
[97:59.77]Those guys were doing all kinds of wild shit.
[98:05.17]But they were like real life superheroes, man.
[98:07.42]I thought the ultimate warrior was seriously Superman.
[98:10.62]It's like, this guy, look at him.
[98:12.01]He's so, he's a superhero.
[98:13.90]We had kind of real life superheroes.
[98:16.83]which is crazy.
[98:18.06]But anyways, I'm going to buy a bunch of this and some of these too.
[98:20.60]I want to try it.
[98:32.29]It makes sense why you liked the Ultimate Warrior?
[98:36.69]What does that mean?
[98:37.42]Why'd you Pepe laugh?
[98:41.52]Alright, so I have access to this now.
[98:43.31]Let's just peek.
[98:47.85]What do I want to do in the other room?
[98:49.60]Let me take a look at the map.
[98:55.53]So the labyrinth is in a different section entirely.
[99:04.05]Let's take a quick peek.
[99:07.00]Oh my god.
[99:09.34]It can't come in here, right?
[99:28.65]Watch out!
[99:29.80]You are just a detriment to me playing the game right now.
[99:36.17]Shit, he throws acid too.
[99:43.40]Oh my god, where are we going?
[99:47.73]Just kill the doll, please.
[99:53.59]Jailkeeper zombie.
[100:05.69]Okay, that one goes down.
[100:07.05]What about this one?
[100:17.47]We're not going to go in there yet.
[100:20.88]That was the... Ow!
[100:22.89]That was like a Darkest Dungeon... No, that was a Dark and Darker staging room.
[100:27.20]That's where the actors hang out for Dark and Darker.
[100:39.14]I'm gonna heal first
[100:48.27]Dude, you know what I keep thinking of?
[100:56.06]There's this video of that, uh, what is it, Brazilian politician that's, he's, he starts talking into the microphone and it's like, he has like a demonic voice.
[101:09.07]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[101:11.23]I can't stop thinking about that.
[101:12.62]That's like in my brain permanently now.
[101:16.77]He like, and he was like, his voice went like, and people were like, what the fuck?
[101:32.95]Alright, I'm actually glad that she's gone.
[101:35.33]I hate to say it.
[101:45.00]It was generally a Call of Duty zombie effect.
[101:48.84]If you haven't seen it, it's unbelievable that a human being could make that sound.
[102:02.45]18 luck.
[102:03.92]Ah, I thought it was gonna be projectiles.
[102:16.03]Oh, permanent offering.
[102:17.35]Nice.
[102:18.84]Something's still in here.
[102:25.21]That's kind of a cool weapon.
[102:27.20]But... At least it replaces my lead pipe.
[102:31.90]Will it even replace it?
[102:36.37]Yeah, for sure.
[102:37.34]This has durability though, but well, it's cool.
[102:45.75]It replaces it.
[102:46.88]It does.
[102:56.40]Holy fuck, he does sound like a god zombie.
[103:00.17]Yeah, I think all you have to look up is like, you know, Brazilian politician, like, demon voice.
[103:05.81]You'll get it.
[103:07.69]Ow!
[103:08.37]I'm going to do that every five seconds.
[103:10.18]It's going to be awful.
[103:11.84]I'm... God damn it.
[103:15.96]Gosh darn it.
[103:22.29]I just thought of it again.
[103:25.49]It's playing on repeat in my head right now.
[103:31.74]It's like... And it's like... And then it gets deeper.
[103:39.07]It's like... Oh, fuck!
[103:44.59]I shouldn't even be here right now.
[103:53.27]Get the fuck out of here with this curse rain.
[104:04.05]No!
[104:10.71]Come on, dude.
[104:11.69]Are you kidding me?
[104:20.42]No-oh, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh.
[104:26.02]He just killed his friend.
[104:38.63]I'm out of everything.
[104:40.93]This better be worth it.
[104:52.21]The power of light!
[105:12.63]I can't, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know how he's, hold on.
[105:25.47]This guy sounds like him.
[105:31.68]I just know how it ends.
[105:32.57]It ends with like, Bastille.
[105:35.29]He says like, Bastille.
[105:43.58]sound like the guy
[105:55.76]I'm gonna die because of this.
[105:57.44]I'm not paying attention!
[106:05.89]Oh.
[106:15.90]Oh my god.
[106:26.97]These guys sound exactly like it.
[106:29.26]That like...
[106:29.74]It's that like...
[106:35.12]I can't find the clip.
[106:36.69]I'll just play the clip.
[106:37.86]Whatever.
[106:38.39]Hold on.
[106:56.70]Where is it?
[107:00.52]It actually is like, oh, here it is, here it is.
[107:18.33]Why can't I hear it?
[107:22.99]Oh, there it is.
[107:30.65]And at the same time, we're not going to stop there.
[107:34.01]We're already there.
[107:37.21]Encomendados.
[107:42.36]Oh my god.
[107:51.09]Shhh!
[107:55.83]It's one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life.
[107:58.54]I have to be honest with you, it's fucking wild.
[108:06.39]encomendados.
[108:17.75]It's fucking crazy.
[108:26.44]That's actually crazy, right?
[108:30.37]It's even funnier when he takes a sip.
[108:32.16]I didn't show it on the screen, but just...
[108:34.84]He takes a sip of the water.
[108:37.38]And it makes it like ten times worse.
[108:49.42]Fuck.
[108:54.23]Okay.
[108:55.04]Let me, let me, what was I doing?
[109:03.18]I knew this was gonna fucking ruin everything.
[109:05.11]He laughs in the demon voice, that sounds... insane.
[109:16.63]That's why I can't watch this video.
[109:20.50]It's my new favorite video.
[109:22.53]It's my new favorite video on YouTube.
[109:25.01]Not even on YouTube.
[109:26.62]It's kind of hard to find it.
[109:29.71]It actually is my new favorite thing ever made.
[109:31.67]It's replaced a lot of things, it really has.
[109:34.42]Ugh.
[109:41.13]It's like, what could possibly make you sound like that?
[109:46.92]This would be like a perfect combination of crazy shit happening.
[109:52.99]This guy's scary.
[109:53.84]I shouldn't be here.
[109:56.22]I'm gonna leave.
[110:03.57]I gotta, I, it kinda, everything kinda derailed.
[110:05.78]Hold on.
[110:08.55]There's loot running.
[110:10.76]Quick loot run.
[110:14.19]Okay, everything's kind of fucked up.
[110:16.04]I'm good.
[110:16.88]What did I even do?
[110:20.98]Okay.
[110:23.45]I'm gonna head back.
[110:31.19]I am so cursed.
[110:36.56]Do I have any candles?
[110:37.33]I do.
[110:50.28]Yeah, it's funny because everybody around is sort of kind of just...
[110:54.18]I think it's them standing there too, just...
[110:56.61]not really reacting.
[110:58.68]There's a couple of people gasp.
[111:01.28]There's a couple of like...
[111:03.95]But the camera pans out, like it cuts to a wide and everyone just kind of standing there just, oh, that was, that was interesting.
[111:12.22]What do we do?
[111:13.77]Is that alright?
[111:14.43]Everything good?
[111:16.74]And then he starts going into it again, and everyone kind of starts, people start to look left and right, like, oh, what the, this is kind of crazy.
[111:25.72]I've been laughing non-stop at it for 15 minutes, please.
[111:30.96]I'm so glad that you've been introduced to that if you've never seen it before.
[111:36.91]Even the thought of it makes me laugh now.
[111:40.36]Just merely thinking of that is bad for my health.
[111:46.07]Okay, let me get back on track here.
[111:50.32]Shit.
[111:52.13]uh I'm gonna leave because I want to there's other things to do in the house

[112:47.50]I'm not going to lie to you on this one.
[112:56.51]I need more jars.
[112:57.28]I need more money.
[113:03.34]I feel like I've just been so disconnected from the entire video game world, at least very recently, that I just, I don't...
[113:11.41]There's nothing that I can really...
[113:13.18]all my games of the year guys are games I don't even was blueprints nominated for anything if it that would be crazy if it wasn't I think it was right
[113:24.15]What best like indie game or something?
[113:25.78]I think it was.
[113:28.54]One thing.
[113:35.07]Because I needed money.
[113:39.34]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[113:40.24]How did I miss all this?
[113:49.90]If I was a little more connected to everything that was coming out this year, maybe I would be like, oh, I wonder what's going to win.
[113:57.90]But I really don't even...
[114:00.73]What was nominated for Game of the Year?
[114:07.94]Expedition 33.
[114:13.44]I'm not doing this right now.
[114:15.17]Let me look at my quests.
[114:17.06]Right.
[114:17.54]Entrance hall.
[114:18.82]Entrance hall.
[114:20.07]So I gotta go...
[114:23.21]here.
[114:24.76]So I had to head to the west basement stairwell and then up.
[114:28.28]So let's go back to nowhere.
[114:31.75]Where am I right now?
[114:32.36]Let's go back to nowhere.
[114:33.04]Oh, you can follow me.
[114:42.69]She's going to follow me all the way in here.
[114:46.94]I'm sorry.
[114:57.54]Let me just see.
[115:02.55]I don't know how much of a spell guy I'm gonna be this time.
[115:04.74]Let's get rid of that.
[115:06.81]I'm definitely not selling the sword.
[115:07.95]This thing is sick.
[115:14.17]Luck is cool, but...
[115:21.00]I'm really just not going to do spells.
[115:22.43]I'm not going to really make any of them really at all.
[115:27.03]Okay, I need jars and acid.
[115:47.10]Oh, that's right.
[115:48.00]I can get the crafting kit.
[115:50.36]I'll remember that for next time.
[116:00.97]Don't have anything for him.
[116:08.71]How much does it cost for that shit?
[116:16.43]75.
[116:19.20]Okay, hold on a second.
[116:21.46]Let me sell some of that trash.
[116:31.73]I need 75 tokens.
[116:35.79]Alright, it's time to sell shit.
[116:38.78]I'm going for it.
[116:40.25]I'm done hoarding.
[116:45.43]I can't do it.
[116:55.75]I can't do it.
[116:57.70]I might need it.
[117:30.51]Okay, I'm ready to go to the entrance hall.
[117:34.02]Screw it.
[117:37.78]Let's clear the curse.
[117:41.54]I don't have any more armor spell?
[117:43.98]That's a load of dog shit.
[118:01.95]Entrance hall.
[118:12.19]Should I try to kill the big guy?
[118:13.68]Or just run by him?
[118:15.02]I feel like it's gonna take up too much of my stuff.
[118:20.90]Scheisse!
[118:21.96]Scheisse!
[118:39.95]Okay, entrance hall.

[122:15.43]Uh, but... Uh-oh.
[122:19.20]I actually might...
[122:22.77]Alright, remind me to bring like two extra vials next time.
[122:42.66]I'm gonna die.
[122:53.92]Why would I put the shield down?
[122:55.57]Alright, we're good.
[123:02.42]Excellent.
[123:04.30]There's the curse sentinel candle.

[123:20.29]permanent offering.
[123:21.16]46 tokens.
[123:24.07]Explore beneath the fireplace in the entrance hall.
[123:29.52]This is creepy.
[123:35.46]I can afford the crafting kit now.
[123:49.35]I feel like I'm scared to go in here.
[123:51.34]I forget what's in here.
[123:54.68]This is a ladder?
[123:55.60]Descend the ladder.
[124:03.14]in the tunnel.
[124:12.50]I have not died in a very long time.
[124:23.24]Okay.
[124:23.66]Tunnel only goes right.
[124:28.54]1892-4.
[124:30.22]Write that down.
[124:36.28]don't want to be in here this is the domicile of bastille sheista herself oh no dude that's true
[124:56.80]Oh, it just lives in my head.
[124:58.64]Cable car station.
[125:11.58]Cable car.
[125:14.92]Pull the lever.
[125:17.93]There's the end of chapter two!
[125:22.74]I ain't doing that yet.
[125:23.94]There's still things I didn't do yet.
[125:37.57]I want to take a look at the big map.
[125:44.55]What has not been done?
[125:50.65]That's... all the quests are done.
[125:52.25]Is there...
[125:57.13]I think I did everything here.
[125:58.25]I didn't do the labyrinth.
[126:01.25]But I think the labyrinth still exists.
[126:03.06]Or maybe should I do the labyrinth?
[126:10.36]I don't think I'm gonna lose access to the labyrinth.
[126:14.05]It's there.
[126:18.12]I think we're good to go.
[126:18.93]I think we're good to go to the next chapter.
[126:26.31]I'm pretty sure I got 95% of everything I wanted to get.
[126:35.35]Thank you.
[126:43.91]And all the chapter ending does is just forces you to a new night.
[126:47.49]So it's as if you died, but you didn't.
[126:53.85]Jeremy, if you were a type of drink, I think you'd be a Coke Zero.
[126:57.22]No, dude.
[126:57.78]I'd be a... Hmm.
[127:01.59]Are you just talking about soda?
[127:05.61]Just a soda.
[127:15.01]No, not Dr. Pepper.
[127:17.99]Actually, Dr. Pepper is interesting, though.
[127:21.31]I did like it a lot.
[127:25.98]Shirley Temple?
[127:29.92]Shirley Temple's a little too put together, I think.
[127:35.61]It's like grenadine and ginger ale or Sprite.
[127:39.83]And it's a little too put together.
[127:43.78]Milk?
[127:44.39]Nah.
[127:48.30]Dr. Pepper is generic?
[127:51.71]Nah.
[127:55.37]You're a slapped together latte at 5 a.m.?
[127:57.98]Nah.
[128:00.96]Pina Colada?
[128:01.90]Nah, it's too extra.
[128:04.42]Classic Coke?
[128:05.24]Nah, no, too classic.
[128:17.28]Mr. Pibb?
[128:18.10]Nah.
[128:18.74]Seven up?
[128:20.73]See, now I think you're on to something.
[128:24.24]I think you're on to seven up.
[128:28.24]No, not LaCroix, please.
[128:30.29]That is insulting to have to...
[128:32.02]It is an insult to have somebody compare you to... You have the personality of a LaCroix.
[128:38.52]That's a way to tell, like, oh, dude, you suck.
[128:41.54]Like, wow, dude.
[128:43.59]Hey, the dude had a personality of a fucking Lime LaCroix.
[128:46.84]Like, whoa, that person must be fucking dull.
[128:52.68]No, seven up.
[128:54.74]I like it.
[129:11.23]Train ride.
[129:18.18]You've stumbled upon something even I don't have an answer for.
[129:27.43]Where does this cable car lead?
[129:28.70]Who built it?
[129:30.16]I think my father was down here earlier.
[129:31.70]He must know.
[129:33.41]I'm sure you think he's an evil man.
[129:36.38]I must admit, I didn't think he was capable of just erasing Peter.
[129:43.37]But you have to understand his intentions are good, even if his methods are questionable.
[129:49.28]I'm certain there's a good reason for all this.
[129:53.55]When we get to the other side, please do not interfere.
[129:56.86]Let me talk some sense into him.
[130:02.14]Yeah, I got sense for him.
[130:07.30]Kald split his head in half.
[130:18.27]Well, he's already dead.
[130:37.34]No, Alfred, I'm sorry.
[130:39.29]Happy New Year, 1916.
[130:52.76]Can you get a flamethrower?
[130:54.02]I actually would use it if I could.
[131:00.27]Boston House, 1916, in a dream.
[131:04.11]Nightingale awakens in a strange infirmary.
[131:07.24]It appears to be 24 years in the future.
[131:11.46]The sound of a distant bell wakes her.
[131:42.63]I still have my inventory.
[131:50.81]You're gonna put that down, or are we gonna fuckin' rumble?
[131:55.96]Hold it right there!
[131:57.91]Are you still human?
[132:00.85]No.
[132:03.20]Yes.
[132:05.05]Oh, thank God.
[132:06.49]I thought you were another one of those girls from the basement.
[132:09.21]You must be a new nurse.
[132:12.33]My name is Mary, and I was just surprised as you when I first arrived.
[132:16.50]Sorry to tell you, but you've come to a terrible place, a nightmare.
[132:19.11]You've been trapped in a sort of communal hallucination.
[132:24.54]Before we talk more, I'm afraid you must go see the king.
[132:27.01]He gets very cross if new arrivals don't present themselves promptly.
[132:31.08]The king is not a man to be trifled with.
[132:34.11]Take this nurse uniform and make sure you wear it before seeing the king.
[132:38.17]You have to be sneaky.
[132:38.97]You can't have a gun like mine until you get a firearm license from the king.
[132:43.14]The king's door is easy to spot.
[132:44.87]It's the only one painted gold.
[132:47.38]Now go and be careful out there.
[132:52.34]Alright.
[132:57.40]nurse's hat.
[133:01.22]Classic Flossie hat named in honor of Florence Nightingale.
[133:09.77]You got anything else?
[133:10.46]Okay.
[133:14.12]There's stuff here though.
[133:17.72]I'm a nurse.
[133:39.49]Where is the...
[133:40.37]There's something else I can search.
[133:47.57]There it is.
[134:00.09]I'm not ready yet Wrong dress
[134:09.83]I mean, come on, man.
[134:13.34]That's pretty close, if you ask me.
[134:16.45]They're the same.
[134:17.93]This is literally the same shit.
[134:21.30]If I walked in there, what do you even know?
[134:28.17]Alright, you tell me that's different, look.
[134:31.85]Okay, it is different, but it's the same colors and the same fucking lineup.
[134:36.12]The apron is the apron.
[134:37.25]Whatever.
[134:39.45]You guys shouldn't have even said anything.
[134:40.45]I would have probably died in that room.
[134:49.60]I need projectiles.
[134:50.67]I need everything.
[134:52.56]I was not ready for a new day.
[134:54.32]That is for sure.
[134:57.89]Well, we're going to have to... Just go for it.
[135:17.97]Hey, same guy from earlier.
[135:19.05]So the Coke Zero opinion was controversial.
[135:20.74]If you think that was bad, I think you would be Chili Cheese Fritos if you were a chip.
[135:24.80]No, that's fine.
[135:25.50]That's a good take.
[135:32.30]What the fuck are you talking about, dude?
[135:35.08]Well, I'm trying to disarm it.
[135:41.05]Now this is the level you don't want to be on!
[135:43.45]You just hit me 400 times.
[135:57.52]Something is in- I'm getting insight, like blood- oh, it's the mirror.
[136:01.03]Holy fucking shit.
[136:14.16]Oh, dude.
[136:15.79]Dude.
[136:18.58]Fuck you, dude.
[136:27.88]I need...
[136:28.89]I'm kind of in trouble here.
[136:29.85]No, I'm not.
[136:33.19]I got plenty of food.
[136:43.29]I am gonna fuck that up every time.
[136:57.43]Goodness.
[136:59.72]Oh my goodness.
[137:02.46]He's throwing fucking grenades!
[137:09.80]Eugh!
[137:17.01]There's so many in this hallway.
[137:18.52]What's his answer?
[137:19.53]Shoot himself in the head?
[137:31.81]That was just crazy.
[137:37.25]I'm so glad I bought these.
[137:46.87]Dude, we got grenades now.
[137:48.63]Are you serious?
[137:51.92]You know I'm projectile guy.
[137:53.95]We're doing- I'm throwing grenades at everybody.
[137:56.34]I'm gonna think this is a grenade from now on playthrough.
[138:14.41]That's gonna be hard to use.
[138:25.16]A ration?
[138:26.41]A hundred health?
[138:27.29]That's...
[138:28.58]I don't know what that's doing to me.
[138:29.62]I think it's making me so I can't do spells, but who cares about spells?
[138:32.77]Don't run in front of the mirror.
[138:35.49]I can't.
[138:36.70]I still.
[138:44.89]Friend?
[138:52.92]Friend.
[138:57.88]Another human!
[138:59.35]How unfortunate for you to have wound up here.
[139:02.32]The name's Edgar.
[139:04.01]I'm still mostly human and mostly alive despite the best efforts of the dream and the war.
[139:09.04]The Wretch King has authorized me to make a living protecting the inhabitants of the Dream that are useful to him.
[139:16.67]Once you talk to the king and get a firearm license, come see me.
[139:23.17]What a strange little bedroom.
[139:38.99]Oh, a mirror, nice.
[139:48.22]I had so many, look at how many of these I had.
[139:55.39]There's been three or four cases where I definitely should have died.
[139:57.65]I'm glad I didn't though.
[139:59.72]Alright, I need to take inventory here.
[140:05.69]there.
[140:09.03]This one.
[140:09.43]I think we're good.
[140:11.99]Some of these might be.
[140:12.75]Yeah, get rid of this one.
[140:15.13]Get rid of this one.
[140:17.40]Get rid of this one.
[140:19.23]Get rid of that.
[140:20.55]Okay, now I can take some of the better ones.
[140:26.80]Have you died a single time?
[140:28.51]Oh, I think like what, three times?
[140:31.92]At least three times, I think, so far.
[140:37.78]That one's good.
[140:38.63]That one's good too.
[140:42.07]I feel like I'm gonna need it later, I know.
[140:46.90]That one is also good.
[140:51.26]What about the sword?
[140:53.36]Stop dodging the soup question.
[140:55.89]I didn't even see a soup question until right now.
[140:58.19]I've been looking at the game.
[141:02.20]Maybe the fire resistance.
[141:03.25]This is probably a fire area.
[141:04.61]I'm trying to remember what's later.
[141:06.16]Probably this.
[141:09.17]I know it's like poison, anti-poison.
[141:15.33]What soup do I think I would be?
[141:16.58]I would be... what's left over after you dip the grilled cheese.
[141:22.39]six or seven times into the tomato soup and the grilled cheese is gone, but there's still that grilled cheese essence in the soup for the last three or four sips.
[141:30.76]Now sit down and shut up.
[141:43.06]I did it on, I hate everything.
[141:50.45]I was about to say, shite.
[141:52.52]But I'm not doing that anymore because I don't want to overdo it.
[142:04.86]Is this how you treat your chat?
[142:07.98]What are you?
[142:09.28]I've got to make sure we, I don't know, I've got to coddle the little baby, chat, or I've got to make sure everyone's comfortable.
[142:17.74]Come on, man.
[142:33.34]Mask off.
[142:37.76]I need to go to the king.
[142:38.55]Those rations are crazy.
[142:45.24]General indecency.
[142:50.65]Why am I holding the twig?
[142:58.32]I saw it was a mirror.
[143:06.15]Nope.
[143:11.23]Number of coins you find by 30%.
[143:16.41]Curse balance ring.
[143:17.75]When below 70% curse, receive 50% more curse.
[143:21.49]When above 70% curse, receive 50% less curse.
[143:26.89]Somebody smarter than me can do all that.
[143:29.78]I don't... That's too much to manage.
[143:31.26]It's like stancing.
[143:32.25]It's like stance switching.
[143:34.57]Alright, this is the...
[143:35.76]Here it is.
[143:40.24]I'm safe to go in there, right?
[143:41.28]Because I'm a nurse.
[143:43.43]Just see what else is down here.
[143:47.84]Are you a hallucination or not?
[143:51.54]quiet this is how you turn stuff into okay this is how you craft bullets and stuff I think
[144:01.63]Alright, can I disarm this?
[144:05.10]I don't think I can.
[144:05.94]Can I roll over it?
[144:07.79]Yes.
[144:08.28]Alright.
[144:09.92]Insurrection.
[144:11.01]This guy's in there.
[144:16.71]Oh my goodness.
[144:21.60]This person is holding a syringe.
[144:33.06]I'm not doing that yet.
[144:36.51]Okay.
[144:39.06]Hallway is clear.
[144:40.11]I know what I gotta do.
[144:41.03]Let's do the can- Oh my god, you idiot.
[144:45.75]I didn't look in here.
[144:47.31]Workshop!
[144:51.10]What's in the workshop?
[144:55.43]Any friends in the workshop?
[144:57.04]I think there's a friend in here.
[145:01.36]There it is.
[145:04.73]Hmm, another nurse.
[145:07.43]I'm Rakhish, master of all things mechanical and a very good friend to have in a dream.
[145:13.86]It's important to be well armed.
[145:15.40]There's many dangerous characters about.
[145:17.85]I'm afraid you'll need a firearm license for the king before I can help you.
[145:21.93]I'm sure you'll have no problem gaining his trust.
[145:24.80]Once you have it, come back and see your new friend, Rakesh.
[145:29.93]Okay.
[145:34.19]What kind of serial would you be?
[145:35.34]I don't... We're not having this conversation.
[145:45.01]Not all of the stars in the dream sky are hot gaseous balls.
[145:52.15]Parallax is easily observable for a few, indicating they are close.
[145:57.14]The mystery of just what these false stars were remained until an expedition was mounted in 1897.
[146:04.08]Through the use of organ grease coated planks, a bridge was constructed.
[146:08.77]Shockingly, these false stars are actually dormant prior iterations of the dream.
[146:14.46]The light we see is just that of the mansion's windows and labyrinth.
[146:18.44]the inhabitants are curiously missing.
[146:21.24]With some effort, the exact year and month of the iteration can be pieced together by examining documents and the state of the mansion.
[146:29.02]All of these Falstar iterations explored to date are recent.
[146:32.42]1892 or later.
[146:36.27]What the heck, man?
[146:46.52]Alright, we'll do throne room now.
[146:56.75]Sup.
[146:58.98]I'm just gonna loot your shit first.
[147:01.77]Gunpowder.
[147:06.25]I got that ring back that I sold that ring.
[147:15.75]crafting, there's the Wretch King.
[147:20.30]And nevertheless, the meat grinder must be operating at full speed now.
[147:25.79]Every week more of those dreadful half-dead men are shipped here, crawling all about stinky of decay, but not for much longer.
[147:35.36]Have you heard of Dr. Robert Blackett?
[147:38.05]I suppose not.
[147:38.98]The youth of today have no appreciation for history.
[147:41.74]Dr. Blackett used to be the caretaker of this building and its inhabitants.
[147:47.14]You'll be pleased to know he has not forgotten about us.
[147:50.29]Off beyond the church to the east, he is constructing a Paradise for us all to live in.
[147:56.06]Ah, listen, you can hear the bells now, how sweet they sound.
[148:00.94]Until Paradise is ready, he has appointed me to watch over this rotting house.
[148:05.46]I'm sure we'll be good friends, you and I. I won't ask you to do anything humiliating like bend the knee or swear an oath of fealty.
[148:13.88]But I do need you to prove where your loyalties are.
[148:17.23]I'd like you to clean up some trash in the hallway.
[148:19.88]Bring me three corrupted fingers.
[148:22.05]Oh shit, I ate them Uh-oh
[148:34.98]I have to go in the bedrooms.
[148:41.67]I have to make some kills here.
[148:54.18]I can't believe you dodged that.
[148:55.28]That's so annoying.
[149:04.27]Alright, your curse rotted down.
[149:05.81]They just have to die.
[149:18.26]Curse Rod is great.
[149:20.74]Okay, well, don't die when the guy's bleeding to death.
[149:28.84]Oh!
[149:30.81]Alright.
[149:31.71]Corrupted finger.
[149:34.97]There we go.
[149:35.37]Okay, I have enough.
[149:37.24]I have a lot of money, do you see that?
[149:39.05]Do I have 150 gold?
[149:45.21]I have 151 gold.
[149:46.64]I need to spend it before I lose it.
[149:48.58]What if I die?
[149:54.19]Mostyn Private Asylum, the controversial home for troubled young women, has closed after 22 years.
[150:00.45]The original administrator, American physician Dr. Robert Blackett, disappeared in 1894, leaving the asylum to his daughter Margaret.
[150:09.58]In the ensuing years, rumors spread of young women departing the asylum in a catatonic state.
[150:15.25]It was not until earlier this year that a private investigator hired by a father of one of the victims uncovered the horrific scope of this strange illness.
[150:23.42]In total,
[150:24.44]Nine young women became comatose from 1892 to 1909.
[150:28.20]Of those, it is unknown how many survive to this day.
[150:33.66]Although no crime could be proven, lawsuits left Margaret Blackett financially ruined.
[150:39.85]The building was surrounded and surrendered to the...
[150:44.72]The building was...
[150:45.62]The building was surrounded.
[150:47.09]to the Monmouthshire County Council on Monday.
[150:57.40]Who's got the erectile dysfunction shirt?
[150:59.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[151:11.14]He read it.
[151:11.86]I've read that.
[151:13.42]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[151:19.27]Why would you read that?
[151:20.07]I don't know.
[151:20.44]They had like an erectile dysfunction Jerma shirt.
[151:23.17]I was like, what the fuck?
[151:23.82]I didn't sell that.
[151:24.62]Where the fuck did you get that?
[151:40.16]Alright, here we go.
[151:41.59]Oh, good.
[151:42.39]I'd like you to eat the fingers.
[151:44.10]Oh, I said I ate them.
[151:46.15]Just kidding.
[151:47.23]I hereby grant you a firearm license.
[151:49.42]Take it to R'kish in the workshop and he'll give you a gun.
[151:52.42]I have a job for you once you're armed.
[151:57.43]Let's go.
[151:58.05]I got so much money.
[152:09.24]I'm gonna give you a Webley MK6.
[152:14.68]Standard issue.
[152:16.80]I've modified it to have a bit of less recoil.
[152:19.59]Perfect for somebody like you.
[152:20.94]It holds six bullets, each one is deadly and loud, be careful.
[152:24.78]There's a hidden training room behind that painting.
[152:26.76]Feel free to practice in there.
[152:29.25]Okay.
[152:30.92]If you find any broken guns and need an upgrade or more ammunition, come see me.
[152:38.08]Alright, nail trap.
[152:40.93]grenade.
[152:46.36]Should I just make like a hundred grenades and open up every door and throw three or four in and just leave until it explodes?
[153:03.27]You misread that comment?
[153:05.06]There's no way I did.
[153:10.85]There's absolutely no way I misread that.
[153:13.00]It was clear as day.
[153:23.32]They were lying to you.
[153:24.63]Oh, okay.
[153:34.02]Dude, chat is a game of telephone.
[153:37.13]Alright, because somebody will, okay.
[153:39.16]Somebody will say something and then somebody will reply to that.
[153:42.62]And then somebody will change that reply to like a potential joke reply.
[153:47.33]And then by the time I get involved, I'm like a third of the way through that conversation that you were having with somebody else.
[153:53.51]And then I read the joke reply.
[153:55.54]And I think that that's what you're talking about.
[154:01.05]the Gaslight Mega Boss.
[154:05.77]Stop snooping on our conversations.
[154:09.64]Alright.
[154:10.64]Alright.
[154:10.89]So let me...
[154:11.55]Wait, what is that?
[154:15.35]Oh, man.
[154:15.85]That's so much more damage.
[154:24.05]Look at all that fire damage.
[154:36.32]Nice.
[154:37.31]Now I got a gun.
[154:39.81]Let's test it.
[154:46.34]Okay, I can practice in here.
[154:54.33]With the gun equipped, hold R2 and flick R or down to switch.
[154:58.28]Okay, you can switch target down.
[155:02.11]I can't aim.
[155:02.61]Why can I not aim down?
[155:05.24]Down does not work for some reason.
[155:08.48]I might have to change it in the menu.
[155:13.00]Because I should be able to aim down, right?
[155:22.37]Okay, so let's test it.
[155:25.08]Oh wait, there we go.
[155:31.61]Okay, that was weird.
[155:34.61]So how do you shoot?
[155:50.01]This thing is going to be insane.
[156:01.39]Let me try the grenades too, or the incendiary bombs.
[156:07.02]Do these leave fire?
[156:10.38]Not really this burn.
[156:14.56]OK. How much explosion radius are the grenades?
[156:26.18]Okay, that's massive.
[156:27.93]That's the whole room.
[156:30.12]Look at how far away I am.
[156:34.36]Shit, okay.
[156:36.50]I gotta keep that in mind.
[156:46.58]Okay, there's a massive amount of damage at the center.
[156:49.88]Everything else, it fills the whole room.
[156:55.61]Okay, I get it.
[156:57.62]Is this loaded?
[157:00.96]Load this thing up.
[157:03.23]What are you doing?
[157:03.84]I respawn right there so I don't lose any...
[157:06.21]I know what I'm doing.
[157:13.58]More lore.
[157:17.82]Worst withering room player ever.
[157:19.77]Oh yeah?
[157:20.23]I got all my ammo and I have my health back.
[157:24.61]Most in house the ones beautiful home with a dark history will finally serve a noble purpose.
[157:29.58]This week restoration work.
[157:31.04]began with the aim to turn the mansion into a recovery home for our wounded boys returning from France.
[157:37.19]Having served previously as a cholera clinic and a private asylum, Mostyn House has everything our boys need to get back in fighting shape.
[157:45.42]Local ladies with a desire to help nurse these brave souls back to health are encouraged to attend free medical training classes each weekend in October.
[158:06.31]Alright, I'm ready to fucking rock and fucking roll, dude.
[158:11.87]Don't need to worry about, uh, jars anymore.
[158:22.09]How come I can't aim the gun anymore?
[158:24.16]I can't aim the gun up or down.
[158:27.52]Does that have to be an enemy present?
[158:31.64]Okay.
[158:32.57]Now... Let's test it.
[158:35.13]I wanna see how much damage it does.
[158:38.16]I even saw it too, like, uh, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[158:55.13]Don't stab me with that thing!
[158:56.26]I don't know what it does.
[159:01.76]Corrupted finger, too.
[159:03.73]Nurse zombie.
[159:13.46]Yeah, I think it has to be context, I think.
[159:21.73]Dude, this is so much better.
[159:32.31]Something's still in here.
[159:34.92]Shotgun shells.
[159:35.93]I'm doing full shotgun.
[159:38.22]I'm gonna upgrade the hell out of that thing.
[159:48.31]Oh, let's go talk to the dude that's here.
[159:57.82]How many chapters are there?
[159:58.69]There are quite a few.
[159:59.70]There's like four or five.
[160:07.59]What the fuck is that thing?
[160:25.68]Like a Monster Rancher character.
[160:35.40]Stop?
[160:36.49]Stop it, please?
[160:44.09]King's Eye.
[160:52.51]Gimme the shotgun.
[160:56.97]Gimme a shotgun.
[161:01.69]Give me a shotgun.
[161:10.13]Gunpowder.
[161:10.67]Nice.
[161:11.48]Alright.
[161:14.60]Let me talk to this guy.
[161:20.83]I got the license, I'm here.
[161:23.28]If you need an experienced soldier, I'll join you for a price.
[161:26.21]I get half of any gold coins you find.
[161:29.02]I carry three first aid kits and plenty of ammo, so I won't be dying on you too quickly.
[161:34.06]The Wretch King magically bound me to the mansion grounds, so I can't follow you beyond the boundary of Mostyn House.
[161:41.92]Um, yeah?
[161:44.90]Let's engage in convivial violence together.
[161:51.80]Alright, well I got a friend.
[161:55.49]Let's go!
[161:55.80]I got enough heals.
[162:01.47]How much ammo do I have?
[162:08.89]I have seven bolts.
[162:15.12]He's not going to accidentally shoot me in the head, right?
[162:17.54]He probably will.
[162:21.55]Did you ban?
[162:22.64]Okay, I'm not reading chat ever again for the rest of my life.
[162:34.25]I'm not reading chat ever again.
[162:40.20]Well, that's a creepy door.
[162:42.49]You want to go in it, dude?
[162:45.54]He said there's a lovely room.
[162:58.22]Okay.
[163:01.53]Good.
[163:07.92]You can come with me this way, right?
[163:09.40]Okay.
[163:16.35]Like, I gotta get off that?
[163:19.31]What is he doing?
[163:22.85]Is this guy alright?
[163:33.33]Oh, he can't.
[163:34.24]Right.
[163:34.64]Please, please, let's go back to the house.
[163:36.15]Well, I... Stay there for a minute.
[163:39.48]You'll be alright.
[163:47.63]Alright.
[163:47.97]Well, we have to go back.
[163:48.79]Oh, the king.
[163:58.46]What have we got for missions here?
[164:00.99]Find the source of the bells to the far east.
[164:04.51]Oh, I have to go talk to the king.
[164:07.22]Oh my god.
[164:08.99]You guys remember that?
[164:10.63]CDI?
[164:11.56]Oh my god.
[164:13.48]I'm laughing.
[164:14.27]I'm laughing.
[164:27.20]I brought a friend.
[164:28.08]Are you familiar with witches?
[164:32.83]They may not have long crooked noses like in the stories,
[164:39.04]but they are very easy as dangerous and devious as their fictional representation.
[164:45.09]A foul witch has taken residence in my basement.
[164:48.28]Every time I send my big wretches down there, they don't return.
[164:56.93]Send this eviction letter to them.
[164:58.52]It's not a normal eviction letter, however.
[165:00.13]She'll be vaporized when she opens it.
[165:03.90]It's imperative that you do not open the letter yourself.
[165:06.96]Return to me with her ashes and I will reward you well.
[165:10.51]I'm granting you the basic wretch pass to reach the basement.
[165:15.22]Now be gone.
[165:17.94]Wanna be doing SEGA CD?
[165:20.69]Uh, whenever it's time.
[165:24.89]Okay, the basement.
[165:27.64]Does that mean I can go down this?
[165:44.40]Do I have a basic knowledge of the Wretch Pass?
[165:47.94]Okay.
[165:48.32]I can go up to... Upper East Stairwell.
[165:54.22]I'm just gonna look.
[165:55.93]I'm just gonna look.
[165:58.65]Let's go up again.
[166:05.38]I don't think we should be here.
[166:10.51]Oh no, you look like a witch.
[166:12.96]You need organs, right?
[166:13.96]I'll get your organs.
[166:14.68]I'm skilled with a knife.
[166:16.19]I come from the farm.
[166:18.13]Not the animal kind, no.
[166:19.68]A farm for people.
[166:21.37]And a great bloody tower far to the east.
[166:24.08]I got out though.
[166:24.70]I tricked them.
[166:25.47]They're not so clever.
[166:26.37]The mind quivers to think of it, the metal creatures with their electric eyes.
[166:31.75]Oh, but the organs, yes.
[166:32.86]I'll bring you organs if you give me coins.
[166:35.47]I've also got a rotating set of armaments for sale if you're looking to do your own butchery.
[166:40.73]Even a farm animal has to make a living.
[166:47.18]Melee damage.
[166:50.33]Melee damage.
[166:51.13]I want to projectile damage one of these.
[166:57.39]No.
[166:59.14]Look at this thing.
[167:02.33]Bayonet.
[167:09.30]Coffin shield.
[167:11.02]Melee damage again.
[167:11.95]A torch.
[167:13.65]Actually, I'm going to take this.
[167:17.22]Sickle.
[167:22.80]Uh, I'll take the torch.
[167:26.40]I want one of these crazy shields too.
[167:28.41]Give me this one.
[167:33.75]I guess this is just a charm, as long as you just have it in your inventory.
[167:36.36]Just have it.
[167:38.83]I'll get the bayonet too.
[167:42.26]What are you, a coward?
[167:56.85]Clear.
[168:04.27]Clear.
[168:08.87]Shoot it.
[168:10.88]Why would you not shoot it?
[168:13.05]Foul beast.
[168:13.89]Foul beast.
[168:17.02]Dude, you have a gun.
[168:18.69]It's not a melee weapon.
[168:19.81]This guy healed full health from... What an idiot.
[168:24.95]He's a friend.
[168:25.77]I'm not gonna be mad.
[168:37.13]Does that work?
[168:42.72]Open.
[168:45.41]What is that?
[168:56.54]What is it?
[168:57.83]What is it called?
[169:00.00]I don't even see it.
[169:00.66]Oh, there it is.
[169:03.33]Oh, it's luck.
[169:17.48]Look at how huge this hallway is.
[169:20.89]This place is gigantic.
[169:25.85]What?
[169:26.92]I need a light.
[169:27.84]Where's my lamp?
[169:33.09]Something feels off about this place.
[169:39.39]Alright, we're out of here.
[169:41.91]I need curse resistance before we go there.
[169:49.36]Is he dead?
[169:50.72]Oh, I just heard a gunshot.
[169:52.29]Uh...
[169:53.19]I think he's...
[169:54.90]I think there's something wrong with our friend.
[169:58.12]He's now just a floating health bar.
[170:07.25]The idol's representation of itself in the dream has several unique properties.
[170:12.28]For one, it can greatly amplify the effects of magical spells nearby.
[170:15.91]More importantly,
[170:17.54]It can restart an iteration afresh even once it is fully dormant and devoid of its inhabitants.
[170:24.44]By submerging the idol in organ grease for a full day, the iteration it belongs to springs back to life.
[170:32.29]The mechanism by which this happens is not fully understood, but perhaps it can be tied back to the blood sacrifices that occurred on the night
[170:39.46]of the lunar new moon a Malenia ago.
[170:44.93]Unfortunately, this process is fraught with great danger, and a direct contact between the same person from two different iterations creates a great concentration of cursed energy.
[170:54.92]Most often this results in a pair of ghosts.
[171:04.72]Does he still attack?
[171:24.01]There he is.
[171:25.92]Oh, his bayonet is in the wrong spot.
[171:28.16]I have no bullets.
[171:37.31]Oh my god!
[171:38.50]You're on your own.
[171:43.38]We gotta go back.
[171:44.19]We gotta go back.
[171:44.63]We gotta go back.
[171:45.76]We gotta go back.
[171:46.86]Close the door.
[171:47.89]Back up!
[171:53.29]You think we can take them?
[172:03.01]I don't think we can do that right now.
[172:06.59]Why am I splitting half the money with you?
[172:12.21]I need more ammo.
[172:14.46]Actually, I kind of need more of everything.
[172:16.57]Let me go back to nowhere.
[172:27.02]See, it's different.
[172:30.23]New Nowhere.
[172:32.40]I like this song too a lot.
[172:34.75]All the Nowhere songs are great.
[172:47.53]Good evening, ma'am.
[172:49.05]You travel lightly.
[172:50.34]These are dangerous times.
[172:51.83]Surely you're in need of some additional weapons or restoratives?"
[172:55.84]I'm Groomio, merchant of nowhere.
[172:59.15]From the everyday necessities to the rare, mysterious and beautiful, Groomio has you covered.
[173:04.11]Additionally, if you have something you'd like to sell, Groomio has plenty of gold on hand.
[173:08.60]My hottest item right now is the organ chamber upgrade.
[173:18.31]100 gold.
[173:20.25]Let's see.
[173:21.16]Speaking of upgrading, I haven't leveled up in a while.
[173:24.09]I guess I need that.
[173:25.43]I gotta go to the labyrinth.
[173:29.36]I need to spend this money unfortunately.
[173:36.14]Huzzah!
[173:52.97]Is this guy?
[173:55.94]Mr. Coffins.
[173:58.17]Start a new night while retaining all items.
[174:00.37]No.
[174:10.20]Alright, plenty of heals.
[174:12.07]Elixir is insane, but I don't want to use it because I need that ancient blood.
[174:19.81]Huzzahs in chat, guys.
[174:26.04]Let's go.
[174:26.44]Huzzah.
[174:38.26]Now I need to upgrade it.
[174:49.90]Harumph.
[174:52.57]Harumph!
[174:59.27]Are you daft?
[175:00.79]Somebody said, are you daft?
[175:07.01]I'm gonna take a look at what we got.
[175:08.32]I need to craft more shit.
[175:14.91]Yeah, you could farm if you want to, but I don't think it's really necessary.
[175:19.93]Like I said, the game is not particularly...
[175:23.65]Like, difficult?
[175:26.66]The difficulty is more in, I guess, managing your stuff.
[175:30.50]So it's not like, oh, I got a farm due to level...
[175:32.85]I gotta do it.
[175:35.14]I gotta farm to level like 30.
[175:36.99]Otherwise, I can't even go to the next room.
[175:47.85]These guys know each other, right?
[175:49.22]Alright, bullets.
[175:56.05]I just want to craft...
[175:57.96]I have tons of grenades.
[176:08.22]I'm gonna have to redo this too, just for a sec.
[176:10.59]Give me a minute, because we're no longer really going to care about melee weapons.
[176:16.35]But you know, we will need to still kind of
[176:30.06]No, that's supposed to be in defense.
[176:35.09]Throwing knife, I guess.
[176:39.44]Can you fix his bayonet?
[176:42.83]Um, I don't think so.
[176:44.30]He might need to die.
[176:49.09]Alright, I've got what I need.
[176:53.19]So many grenades.
[176:54.03]Alright, there's more of this too.
[176:56.46]When people come into contact with their twins from the false star iterations, cursed energy is released.
[177:02.30]This fact points us towards a possible explanation of the curse.
[177:06.88]Cursed energy is most likely a distortion or hole in the fabric of the dream.
[177:11.37]that connects these different iterations.
[177:13.99]This would explain why the odd sights encountered when cursed can always be found elsewhere in a different iteration.
[177:19.85]The bloody table, just an instrument tray from the infirmary.
[177:24.85]The skinned body, just an ancient decoration from the Byzantine labyrinth.
[177:28.88]Ghosts then would be walking distortions, caught between two iterations but belonging fully to neither.
[177:35.83]A camera seems to resolve this discrepancy by forcing them to exist or not exist definitively.
[177:43.51]Hey, can you say hi to my dog?
[177:44.60]She's a huge fan.
[177:45.93]Hey.
[177:47.30]Hey, hey.
[177:48.59]Hey, look, look, look.
[177:49.87]Hey fan!
[177:51.09]Hi fan!
[177:52.36]Hi fan dog!
[177:53.29]Hi!
[178:06.19]They can't understand you, just they can.
[178:16.74]My dog, my dog didn't react to that.
[178:21.82]Chat.
[178:25.18]Okay.
[178:26.07]What's the quest?
[178:29.38]Which in the basement?
[178:31.14]So I gotta go down.
[178:37.78]My cat's watching, can you say hi?
[178:39.35]Nope, not anymore.
[178:48.11]What the fuck?
[178:52.28]Whip.
[178:54.77]This is not poison, right?
[178:57.44]Healing book?
[178:59.86]Wait, I'm gonna cast Healing Book because he needs it.
[179:10.28]Can't be used by suffering from silence.
[179:12.25]Oh my god.
[179:13.07]That's what the... How do I clear silence?
[179:19.24]It is poison.
[179:20.11]It's poison.
[179:20.73]It's poison.
[179:21.28]It's poison.
[179:21.72]It's poisonous.
[179:22.32]It's poisonous.
[179:23.43]This thing clears poison.
[179:27.29]Stand next to me, Alfred.
[179:28.46]I don't even know what your name is.
[179:29.48]Is it clearing it?
[179:35.02]Kind of?
[179:36.39]It kind of works.
[180:00.22]Shoot it!
[180:02.03]Shoot it!
[180:02.59]Whoa!
[180:03.96]What the fuck was that?
[180:05.30]Shoot it!
[180:07.01]Nice job, Alfred.
[180:08.91]Shoot that!
[180:10.21]There's a man on the ceiling!
[180:13.68]Shoot him!
[180:15.59]Shoot him!
[180:20.89]Alright, nice work, dude.
[180:26.28]I'm just waiting for this to come down.
[180:38.86]Rotted Initiate, ew.
[180:44.32]Worshipper.
[180:46.34]Filthy creatures no longer desire to be clean.
[180:54.53]That's interesting.
[181:01.10]Are there any bolts in this?
[181:05.17]Let's clear this.
[181:07.96]I want to clear this status spec for a second.
[181:09.83]It's going to take a minute, but whatever.
[181:15.50]I'm glad I have this thing still.
[181:18.33]First door, what's in it?
[181:22.36]Rickety stairwell.
[181:24.81]Oh, wait.
[181:25.65]I think this connects to...
[181:30.81]I think this connects to the other...
[181:32.86]It does, doesn't it?
[181:35.75]Labyrinth entrance.
[181:37.47]Cool.
[181:41.73]Cool.
[181:42.21]Alright, let me... do this first.
[181:49.65]I need one more Ancient Blood.
[181:52.42]Come on, man.
[182:01.46]Oh, I must have nodded off.
[182:06.88]My apologies.
[182:11.27]I want that crafting kit.
[182:14.89]Can I sell?
[182:15.51]I need to sell a ton of shit.
[182:17.54]You know what?
[182:20.45]I'm gonna regret this but I don't care.
[182:24.08]I'm not using spells, I'm not crafting spells.
[182:27.43]Why have spellbook shit?
[182:29.51]What's the point?
[182:31.02]Right?
[182:31.82]What's the point if I'm not even using it?
[182:39.94]I'm not using these either.
[182:43.08]I've used these twice.
[182:47.47]I'm not gonna use the whip.
[182:48.77]It's cool, but I'm not using it.
[182:52.18]Am I ac- Ugh!
[182:53.31]Fuck you!
[182:53.99]Whatever.
[182:56.54]That gets me every time and it's so awful that it works every time.
[183:06.21]Keep the bayonet.
[183:12.47]Shite.
[183:13.73]That's prey instincts.
[183:14.92]No, that's survival instinct.
[183:19.66]Cause I'm ready to fight.
[183:20.73]Do you know what I'm saying?
[183:21.50]You might startle me, but like I'm here.
[183:24.17]If you do that, whoa, I'm immediately paying attention to my surroundings and both my hands are up.
[183:31.68]And if I have some kind of a weapon near me, you better be ready.
[183:35.94]Because that weapon's near me, and I'm ready to use it.
[183:38.98]If a ghoul fucking broke in here right now, it is a battle to the fucking death.
[183:45.65]I'm taking- I'm grabbing my monitor.
[183:47.40]Dude, I'm turning around and I'm going to throw it as hard as I- I'm gonna smash this monitor into whatever's in your head.
[183:54.16]That's weapon one.
[183:55.28]That's right in front of me.
[184:01.67]You throw it like Bowser?
[184:06.49]Remember when a bee was in your room and you jumped like a deer?
[184:10.93]Actually, it was a hornet.
[184:13.04]Excuse me, I would not jump if a bee was in the room.
[184:16.29]It was a yellow jacket.
[184:17.51]Those things are aggressive.
[184:18.76]And it's hard to fight those because it's like swinging at air, okay?
[184:23.16]That's hard to fight something that's microscopic compared to you.
[184:30.71]So you have to flee sometimes because how can you fight something which cannot be seen?
[184:34.54]Thinking face.
[184:40.65]I need something that's more valuable than that.
[184:45.51]Whatever.
[184:52.24]It's like Shadow of the Colossus.
[184:53.40]That's right.
[184:55.37]You know how many times I've told you...
[184:57.96]I'm going to smash a fucking monitor into that thing's head.
[185:01.17]Do you know how many times I've talked about a mosquito being in a room and you, good luck finding it.
[185:07.83]What about a spider?
[185:09.45]Oh my god, a spider!
[185:10.40]I found a spider and then I lost it and I never found it again and it freaks me out when you can't find it.
[185:15.30]I don't even kill spiders.
[185:20.03]Spiders, I don't really mind.
[185:21.18]Or it's like a cockroach or something got it.
[185:26.95]Oh my god, there it goes.
[185:28.09]I can't find it anymore.
[185:32.52]What do you do with them then?
[185:33.44]You leave them alone.
[185:37.56]As long as the spider does not encroach, okay?
[185:41.82]See, my brother and I had this philosophy.
[185:45.08]And it was a long time ago.
[185:47.41]There was a spider...
[185:48.74]that was in our bathroom.
[185:52.23]We all lived together obviously as a family.
[185:54.65]And in the family bathroom, there was a kind of a web in the corner in the bathroom.
[185:59.72]And we could have just got rid of it, but my brother had this great philosophy where he said, hey, as an encroached, that is not encroached yet at all.
[186:09.71]And the more that I thought about it, I was like, you know what, wait a minute, what does that mean?
[186:14.66]That spider, we would look up there, and it was just a little...
[186:17.87]It was like a...
[186:20.30]It was as big as...
[186:23.21]It was like as big as your fingernail.
[186:24.78]It was like a little...
[186:26.54]I don't even know what kind of spider it was.
[186:27.63]It was like a regular house spider.
[186:28.61]It was tiny.
[186:30.19]And every time I looked up there, it was up there.
[186:33.69]I never saw it anywhere else.
[186:35.64]It never encroached.
[186:38.30]It never tried to hurt us or anything.
[186:40.27]So it's like, you know what?
[186:41.02]He's right.
[186:41.88]It never encroached.
[186:42.83]So why would I, you know, be mad about that?
[186:44.78]And he was probably eating and killing all the bad shit that you don't want in your house.
[186:51.82]Now, I'm also not going to say, let the bugs reign supreme in your house.
[186:58.94]Oh, there's a bug.
[187:00.00]And he's... Oh, don't wanna...
[187:01.59]He's not encroaching.
[187:02.52]It's just a fucking cockroach trying to eat the trash.
[187:09.43]Chat thinks we have roaches now.
[187:12.38]No.
[187:13.40]All I'm saying is that if there's no encroachment, if there is encroachment, then that's where you'd be ready.
[187:20.27]You know, you have like a brown recluse in your house and it's like on the ceiling in your bedroom.
[187:25.50]That's total encroachment.
[187:27.55]And that's a battle to the death.
[187:30.78]That's total encroachment.
[187:34.54]That didn't work that time.
[187:38.29]Roach is our kill on sight.
[187:43.03]Alright, but yes, the definition of a cockroach is the definition of encroachment, okay?
[187:50.96]because a cockroach is in your house because it's trying to eat the food in your house, which is an encroachment on your property, on your thing.
[187:58.10]That's your food.
[188:00.24]It's trying to eat your shit, trying to get into your shit.
[188:02.21]That's encroachment.
[188:05.14]The very definition of what a cockroach's existence is, is encroachment on other things.
[188:12.02]Is it outside?
[188:12.85]I don't give a shit.
[188:22.06]Wait, I don't...
[188:22.97]I don't have roaches, guys.
[188:29.66]Alright, what was I doing?
[188:34.18]But what if it's the humans that are encroaching on the cockroach territory?
[188:41.00]That's a philosophical and a chain of debate that I'm not prepared for right now, okay?
[188:56.52]If a roach is encroaching on your kitchen, then your kitchen is dirty.
[189:03.27]Okay, but that still doesn't matter.
[189:05.17]That's your...
[189:09.30]So what you're saying is, okay, I'm not reading this, I'm just saying this as if somebody's saying it.
[189:15.45]You're saying that if somebody is dirty,
[189:18.12]Hold on.
[189:20.03]Let me get this straight.
[189:22.44]Just because you are dirty does not mean that roaches deserve to die.
[189:27.54]Is that what you're saying?
[189:28.26]What's the philosophical angle you're taking on that one?
[189:36.65]Okay, so because you are dirty means that you have attracted the encroachment, so it is your fault, therefore,
[189:45.16]The roach does not deserve to die because the roach is doing its natural instinct to go to a dirty thing.
[189:50.31]So you are the problem because you are dirty.
[189:53.66]The problem is with you.
[189:56.41]but that's not even necessarily true because I've seen roaches in like clean places before.
[190:06.18]I don't even hate roaches.
[190:07.59]I understand their existence.
[190:09.27]They're very important.
[190:11.88]Look, flies drive me insane, but I know why they exist.
[190:16.95]There's one thing that I will tell you, mosquitoes, though.
[190:18.80]Fuck mosquitoes.
[190:19.50]Mosquitoes kill every mosquito on site.
[190:23.10]Doesn't matter.
[190:23.52]Kill them all.
[190:25.98]They serve absolutely no purpose besides to be a pest and a nuisance.
[190:33.54]ticks and mosquitoes do not serve any ecological purpose, at least for me.
[190:40.96]Cockroaches eat decaying organic matter.
[190:43.19]They clean.
[190:43.79]They're the world's cleaners.
[190:45.70]Beautiful.
[190:46.15]Wonderful.
[190:46.53]What a great story.
[190:47.53]Mosquitoes just kill you and they eat
[190:49.70]and they bite you and they cause disease and illness everywhere.
[190:55.55]They're food for other bugs.
[190:56.79]Eat them all.
[190:58.48]Eat as many of them as you can.
[191:03.42]You know, mosquitoes are the most deadly animal on Earth.
[191:07.20]They're the most deadly thing on the planet.
[191:09.95]That's encroachment.
[191:10.74]I'm sorry.
[191:11.28]I'm sorry.
[191:11.50]When you read a statistic that says that mosquitoes kill more people on Earth than anything on Earth, that's total humanity encroachment.
[191:20.57]Sorry guys.
[191:25.23]That is humanity encroachment on our human race.
[191:28.99]Not just your bedroom.
[191:30.37]That is an encroachment on the human race.
[191:35.40]All they ever do is encroach.
[191:44.14]They're pollinators, you idiot.
[191:48.94]Mosquitoes are pollinators?
[191:51.43]What do you mean they're...
[191:57.56]The males, males only eat nectar.
[192:04.29]Shit, well... Fuck mosquitoes, they... Stop doing that when I'm trying to...
[192:09.04]They've done it so many times!
[192:18.30]Doesn't matter, kill him.
[192:22.33]Go look at the statistic, dude.
[192:25.30]Mosquitoes kill more things than like everything combined.
[192:30.18]They are the biggest human predator to everything, times everything by 100.
[192:36.00]They are the most destructive force against the human race on Earth.
[192:41.55]I think this statistic, I could be completely wrong.
[192:44.53]So go fact check it.
[192:45.61]I don't give a shit.
[192:46.19]It might be fake news.
[192:47.12]I don't care.
[192:48.55]I think mosquitoes have killed millions of people.
[192:51.98]Millions of them.
[192:53.30]Go look it up.
[192:58.39]They've killed millions of fucking people.
[193:02.47]Diseases aren't their fault though.
[193:08.99]Mosquitoes aren't weapons, it's secondary vectors that kill.
[193:14.75]But hold on a second.
[193:17.14]If your house is dirty, then the problem is with you.
[193:22.60]Where do these mosquitoes get this disease?
[193:27.99]We have pro mosquitoes in chat.
[193:33.56]Mosquitoes are useless as fuck.
[193:42.37]Somebody said, I don't give a fuck.
[193:44.56]They are un...
[193:46.81]Hold on, I have to read what you said.
[193:47.93]It was fucking wild.
[193:55.60]It was funny.
[193:59.87]Big mosquito.
[194:02.35]They are, okay, they are still uncaring parasites.
[194:09.46]Like we're talking about, we're talking about like mosquitoes.
[194:16.93]Uncaring.
[194:21.06]Dude, how fucked up is it?
[194:22.59]Can you imagine if humans, if mosquitoes were like as big as cheetahs?
[194:28.06]We would be so fucked.
[194:30.15]Can you imagine if the house spider was as big as an antelope?
[194:35.05]Human beings would never have progressed.
[194:38.21]Imagine if we had true action.
[194:40.11]Here's something crazy.
[194:41.70]Think about this one, guys.
[194:43.51]You want a little philosophical boom?
[194:47.71]The human race is one of the only things, probably the only, the only species on this planet
[194:53.90]where its biggest predator... Stop it!
[194:56.49]I'm philosophically talking to my chat.
[194:59.67]The human race's biggest predator is itself.
[195:05.90]Whoa.
[195:10.80]Our biggest predator
[195:13.86]is us.
[195:15.99]What the hell?
[195:18.64]What the fuck, dude?
[195:24.31]Can you imagine if there was a bug that just scooped up people on the fucking sidewalk?
[195:33.76]And it was just like, whoa, dude, like as if it was like a murder statistic that you hear or like something you hear about.
[195:42.75]Oh, yeah, dude, it's so horrible.
[195:44.42]Yeah, Joe got picked up by a fucking super mosquito.
[195:48.44]Yeah, he's just gone.
[195:50.52]And that happened like three or four days a week.
[195:54.40]How crazy would that be?
[195:58.86]What about cars?
[196:00.14]Cars are an extension of humans.
[196:03.83]who was controlling the car.
[196:09.62]You don't see a fucking dog driving a car around.
[196:14.17]I know that you've
[196:14.61]Not in your Sora AI videos, I'm sure you've seen.
[196:18.11]Of course you've seen the dog drive away video 5,000 times.
[196:21.66]Oh, the cat.
[196:22.54]I'm going to see your license.
[196:24.03]No, you know, you drive by the lights.
[196:26.37]They do the drive away that I'm talking about in real life.
[196:36.28]How many bowls did you smoke today?
[196:46.66]None.
[196:48.47]But I am going to take a break because I have to pee and it's been like four hours or something.
[196:57.86]Yeah, guys, it...
[197:01.92]He's just doom scrolling on YouTube?
[197:03.77]No, that, we're just, what are you talking about?
[197:11.26]Predation implies eating the thing you kill.
[197:13.78]I think you mean biggest killer of humans, not predator.
[197:17.44]I'm just talking about in general.
[197:21.20]imagine walking imagine going outside to get the mail and there is a chance
[197:26.72]that you need to kind of look around before you go out the door because there could be like a five, like a 10 foot tall
[197:32.53]giant mosquito with like a giant spear in his face.
[197:37.55]that literally could just like skewer you and pick you up and just fucking eat you and suck all your fluids out of your body in 10 seconds.
[197:44.69]That would be so fucked up.
[197:50.33]That happens in Australia.
[197:56.32]Alright, the people saying God, oh wow, I wish.
[197:59.65]Alright, okay, dude.
[198:03.17]Okay, dude.
[198:09.36]That's what DDT is for?
[198:10.85]Yeah, and I don't want that shit.
[198:13.10]That stuff poisons every water supply too, like it's every-
[198:18.02]You know what, we just need to let the bats handle it.
[198:49.44]Me when I'm in Gotham, worried about the crime.
[198:54.88]Alright, I'll be right back.
[198:58.47]Thank you.
[199:38.08]Thank you.
[199:48.52]Amen.
[200:39.96]Thank you.
[201:23.97]So,
[202:21.53]Thank you.
[203:12.40]Thank you.
[203:41.09]Thank you.
[204:02.52]Thank you.
[204:16.02]Mm-hmm.
[204:53.49]Thank you.
[205:45.01]Thank you.
[206:12.43]Thank you.
[206:24.71]Thank you.
[206:35.73]Thank you.
[207:26.66]Thank you.
[207:54.13]Thank you.
[208:17.45]Thank you.
[209:08.37]Thank you.
[209:23.76]I'm back.
[209:28.13]I'm back to tell you that I'm going to be leaving in probably like 40 minutes.
[209:37.02]And that just sad.
[209:47.43]Isn't that just sad to hear?
[209:49.48]I didn't have my headphones in so you didn't scare me.
[209:55.11]We'll see, maybe like an hour.
[209:57.67]We'll see how the vibes are.
[210:12.29]Fighting the mosquitoes.
[210:13.42]Fight the mosquitoes.
[210:20.27]It's not fair.
[210:21.22]Favorite Christmas movie, Home Alone.
[210:24.06]And Home Alone 2, back to back.
[210:35.20]It's got to be back to back though.
[210:44.08]Muppet Christmas Carol, that is a close third, second or third maybe.
[210:53.95]Ernest Saves Christmas is up there, yeah.
[211:03.22]You know what?
[211:03.88]I'm gonna get one more of these Bloods.
[211:07.82]I definitely have...
[211:10.59]Because they drop from these guys.
[211:13.06]Hope I'm leveled up enough to do it.
[211:18.25]This guy has a lot of health.
[211:20.81]Oh my goodness.
[211:22.21]Shyster.
[211:26.81]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[211:30.46]What the hell was that?
[211:35.50]That was the goofiest shit.
[211:36.59]I'm dead.
[211:37.19]I'm dead.
[211:38.40]This is game over.
[211:43.06]What the fuck is this?
[211:44.11]I hate this guy.
[211:45.01]This guy's a weirdo.
[211:46.10]I'm out of here.
[211:46.64]Goodbye.
[211:47.00]Never mind.
[211:47.37]I'll be back.
[211:51.92]He's skipping along and then he grabs you like a charger.
[211:56.19]Well, you just made me use a bunch of items.
[211:57.94]Thanks for nothing.
[212:07.49]Alright, what were we just doing?
[212:09.64]Right, back to nowhere.
[212:10.59]I have tons of grenades, I'm ready.
[212:14.60]I can't believe I used bullets on that bullshit.
[212:19.91]I wanted the crafting kit.
[212:26.40]That's what I was even doing down there.
[212:30.53]I need 75 coins.
[212:38.26]Okay, now I can do it.
[212:39.97]Huzzah.
[212:53.41]Okay.
[212:55.24]An ingenious portable kit for crafting items that would normally require an occult wax table or laboratory workbench.
[213:02.83]Wonderful.
[213:04.05]So how do I do that then?
[213:08.53]How do I get to that menu?
[213:20.93]All your favorite games have a small safe area that's disconnected from time and space.
[213:25.67]That checks out.
[213:29.70]Do I have to actually use the item?
[213:36.22]Thank you.
[213:43.19]Hmm.
[213:49.13]Where is it?
[213:52.63]Okay, wait a minute, it's technically a tool.
[214:02.67]Okay, that's cool.
[214:03.53]Alright.
[214:05.12]Very cool.
[214:05.91]Let's go.
[214:07.86]No bullets.
[214:09.15]I do have grenades.
[214:09.96]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[214:11.21]Poison too.
[214:12.09]I got these.
[214:13.24]Move.
[214:20.89]Alright, let's head back to the...
[214:23.26]It was down here.
[214:29.68]Is my buddy still here and alive?
[214:32.35]Ah, whatever.
[214:35.05]I don't need him.
[214:37.01]I kind of do need him though.
[214:39.30]Speaking of this boys like I buy poison clothes.
[214:41.75]Don't I have to be in the nurse outfit anymore?
[214:44.97]This does have poison buildup on it.
[214:47.04]Reduction.
[214:49.53]This is curse rot.
[214:51.43]Something probably has crazy poison, right?
[214:54.89]paralysis.
[214:57.92]There it is way less poison build up.
[215:03.12]What rings to?
[215:06.71]Keep the damage one on.
[215:08.14]Spell Toll, Luck, Paralysis.
[215:10.51]There's got to be a Poison Resist run, right?
[215:12.14]Physical damage.
[215:15.86]Double damage.
[215:17.36]No.
[215:19.37]No.
[215:21.59]These are all curse rings.
[215:25.27]protective rings here we go bleeding curse bleeding fire poison alright so let's do switch that one for this one
[215:40.79]Is there a poison resist, uh, necklace?
[215:43.40]Yep.
[215:46.89]Holy shit, this thing is unbelievable.
[215:49.32]That's even, wow, this one's, yeah, alright, that's good.
[215:56.35]Oh wait, cures poison status effect once every minute.
[216:00.62]That's good too, but I think that's- I think I'm alright.
[216:06.70]Press the best in slot button.
[216:08.71]Do you know what I saw that I thought was crazy?
[216:11.78]Um...
[216:13.01]Dude, World of Warcraft, whatever.
[216:15.90]Do you know World of Warcraft is coming out with just one button mode?
[216:20.21]Where you just press one button and it does your entire character's rotation in a row?
[216:26.90]I saw that and I said, wait, what the fuck, man?
[216:29.22]What are we talking about?
[216:30.51]It's already out.
[216:31.17]Food mode.
[216:34.74]But they made it so that the global cooldown is 25% longer, so it's not technically the best way to cast all the abilities.
[216:43.05]Phone app mode, yeah.
[216:50.72]Alright, well.
[216:52.41]This guy's got a flamethrower.
[216:53.63]This is kind of awful.
[216:54.81]This area is kind of rotten.
[216:58.08]Grenade.
[216:59.10]You know what the play is, right?
[217:02.01]Boom!
[217:09.30]Oh my god!
[217:10.27]I killed one.
[217:15.54]I killed one of them.
[217:25.20]Dude, it actually works even though it's very hard.
[217:29.97]Flamethrower zombie.
[217:36.24]That dude just...
[217:39.18]Poison Jario.
[217:47.49]Nice bullets.
[217:50.07]I've yet to find one that I can run from a bullet.
[217:56.77]Barricaded room.
[218:04.70]Is he almost done?
[218:05.45]Ads were playing when he said something sad happened.
[218:08.15]What?
[218:11.12]Yeah, the pre-rolls have been on.
[218:13.13]I haven't really done mid-rolls to turn them off.
[218:16.53]It's been like a month or two.
[218:19.66]I haven't been getting up and taking a break every hour either.
[218:22.73]That's why I haven't been really running them, but...
[218:26.00]I might go back to doing that.
[218:30.00]I feel like it's healthier for me.
[218:32.91]But yeah, pre rolls have been on.
[218:39.10]I thought it was nice.
[218:40.78]That was a good system.
[218:44.37]Alright, well, here's the thing.
[218:45.83]You guys know what it's like with them on.
[218:47.72]You know what it's like with them off.
[218:52.51]In the couple of months that we were doing, like maybe three months or so of the mid-rolls being on with the breaks every hour and just having the ads play over BRB,
[219:06.58]Because either way, it does encourage me to actually get up, and I really should be, if I'm very honest.
[219:15.88]Is that thing alive?
[219:18.31]I liked it better with bricks.
[219:19.66]I like bricks.
[219:22.35]Mid rolls are better.
[219:23.18]Mid rolls are better.
[219:27.27]I like the brakes because I can just get up and not miss anything.
[219:32.99]Free rolls are 30 seconds a stream, but you do mid rolls right with not doing anything during it.
[219:40.77]I'm just trying to mitigate how annoying they can be.
[219:46.80]And...
[219:50.78]I think the mid rolls do, I believe, make more money.
[219:56.87]right because there's more ads are being played technically I think if you actually break down mathematically because okay if you if there's
[220:04.85]If there's like 10,000 people that watch a stream,
[220:09.33]And they're shown in ad, I guess.
[220:11.75]I don't know, like, the exact mathematics of impressions.
[220:15.69]But... Um...
[220:19.08]I would just prefer it be the best possible way to have nobody really have to... What the fuck is that guy?
[220:25.82]Um...
[220:29.09]Because ads are annoying.
[220:30.45]I've always thought that.
[220:31.22]I've always thought the ad...
[220:32.81]I've always thought ads are just done so poorly on Twitch in general.
[220:38.62]that if we had more control and we didn't have to have all these
[220:43.62]stipulations on it.
[220:45.02]I don't know.
[220:45.72]It's always been kind of like, kind of ass.
[220:47.43]It's always been sort of dog shit the whole time.
[220:51.20]But...
[220:53.27]If it is better to not really have to worry about missing content,
[220:58.94]If somebody comes to the stream and they're like, well, I don't want to sit here and watch this versus three minutes
[221:06.08]But I mean, three minutes is a long time though, right?
[221:09.27]That's what was kind of concerning me about when I was doing that before.
[221:12.10]Is even if I take a break...
[221:15.16]If I'm gone for four or five minutes and three of those minutes are ads, it still is like three straight minutes of ad content that
[221:22.38]Obviously, if you're not using an ad blocker, you'll see it.
[221:26.12]I just didn't want to be annoying with that either.
[221:31.37]I prefer hourly breaks than mid rolls, but I don't even see ads anyway.
[221:36.89]Three minutes ain't that long.
[221:44.72]It adds up, yeah.
[221:48.18]We'll see.
[221:49.02]Another thing, too, about, like, the having to run them, um, on that...
[221:53.70]I know I'm supposed to be playing the game right now, but we got a second.
[221:56.17]We got a second.
[221:58.54]I know you guys know this, but if you don't have Twitch automatically do it, it's not even fucking worth doing it.
[222:09.21]I think you only get like 30% of the money if you don't do the automatic.
[222:16.11]Has to be three minutes an hour.
[222:18.08]It is an unbelievably bad revenue split.
[222:22.52]So, it's just almost like not worth doing it.
[222:26.05]to get rid of the pre-rolls and make less money, they just take most of it.
[222:31.67]So it is kind of annoying to have to, even with the hour breaks, I'll be honest with you, let's be totally transparent, right?
[222:38.60]I would see that something like a break was coming up and it's like, okay, this is going to get rid of pre-rolls, but I'm not quite ready to leave yet.
[222:44.80]It's like I'm in the middle of doing something or something's going on.
[222:47.55]And I, oh, we can snooze the ads, but sometimes you need to snooze it a little longer than that.
[222:51.52]It's like, oh, I want more than 10 minutes, more than five minutes snooze.
[222:55.61]But that messes up the potential three minutes an hour.
[222:58.18]Oh, sorry.
[223:00.31]Those automatic ads didn't play.
[223:04.69]It's just kind of stupid all around, if I'm honest.
[223:13.45]Um, so having to like hit that, make sure the ads are on automatic three minutes, otherwise you don't get
[223:20.60]You get paid fucking...
[223:23.31]I mean, let's be honest.
[223:24.10]If I'm gonna run ads, if I'm gonna run ads, I want the fucking money.
[223:27.29]You know what I'm saying?
[223:27.85]I don't want Twitch to get the fucking money.
[223:30.22]Let me just be totally fucking honest.
[223:33.39]Like, the point of running an ad on this stream is not for me to pay Twitch.
[223:37.66]Like, oh hey dude, yeah, just take it all, dude!
[223:40.43]Yeah, there's ads running on the stream, but just fucking take it.
[223:42.89]Have it all.
[223:44.38]No, if ads are gonna play here, then I want at least a reasonable fucking split.
[223:51.59]Fuck that.
[223:57.44]I get it, right?
[223:58.33]I understand that Twitch as a platform has to make money and blah, blah, blah.
[224:01.33]But whatever.
[224:01.77]I mean, like, dude, I'm...
[224:03.26]If there's going to be ads that are going to be blasting people on this stream, you ain't going to take 60-70% of that.
[224:13.30]That's how I feel.
[224:29.18]Stop saying those numbers.
[224:30.41]Those are some of the most common numbers in the world.
[224:34.40]It's like, guys, don't say numbers, but one, two, three, four, five.
[224:39.60]If you got a snapshot of every time you said the number four in a day, it's probably like a dozen times at least.
[224:49.59]Now, I'm gonna shoot this guy.
[224:53.49]And it's gonna end the fucking game.
[225:18.37]Goodbye.
[225:19.93]I got no more room!
[225:22.10]Oh fuck!
[225:28.20]Don't die, please.
[225:31.63]Is he still there?
[225:37.49]Is he dead?
[225:38.28]Did he die?
[225:39.32]Where's his body?
[225:43.06]Okay, he's dead.
[225:45.11]Why did he explode?
[225:50.07]Whatever.
[225:51.32]I get to save...
[225:52.26]I get to save a grenade.
[226:13.51]Yeah!
[226:14.95]That's what I'm talking about.
[226:16.20]Let's get this thing loaded up.
[226:20.20]Let's get this thing loaded up.
[226:30.52]Yeah, I want that shotgun first.
[226:32.57]I'm not fucking around.
[226:40.71]And also, again, I want to make this clear too,
[226:44.84]Uh, if people run ads, if people do make money on their streams, I'm not, don't use me as the barometer for what everybody should do.
[226:52.71]Do you know what I'm saying?
[226:53.92]Don't do that.
[226:57.19]If I'm doing something a certain way, that's just the way I'm doing it because that's the way that I'm comfortable doing it or that I want to do it.
[227:03.74]Don't use me as a barometer for how everybody else should do it too.
[227:08.59]Okay?
[227:09.36]Please.
[227:20.14]Everybody runs their channels differently, everybody has different goals, different reasons for everything, right?
[227:25.53]I'm just doing it the way that I'm doing it.
[227:28.42]And if I make some money doing it, cool.
[227:30.87]If I make some money doing it, great.
[227:33.76]If it's annoying, then I'm going to try to avoid it being annoying.
[227:37.27]If people don't care and they tolerate it, they think that's fine, then we'll figure it out.
[227:42.15]It's just what we do here.
[227:44.63]Okay, it's an individual thing.
[227:54.13]This way sucks.
[227:55.15]You should do it this way.
[227:58.05]I'm saying for me, okay?
[228:01.22]I do think it sucks.
[228:02.32]I think ads just suck on Twitch.
[228:05.23]And it's been like that for a long time.
[228:12.93]on the internet at large.
[228:14.49]I've talked about this already, of how
[228:17.94]There's a way to do advertising that doesn't just fucking annoy people.
[228:20.73]There's a way to just... You don't have to just put it randomly in the middle of random shit.
[228:25.75]it's like the YouTube problem, right?
[228:28.21]Where you can, people sometimes just let them go and it's like, oh, I'm in the middle of watching this thing and then,
[228:34.29]Like, everybody look at this fucking loud ad that's just breaking up the thing you were just seeing.
[228:41.62]There's a reason why, and I don't want to give television points on this, but I'm going to.
[228:48.76]You know when Family Guy is like, oh Lois, what are you talking about?
[228:53.01]Oh man, this is going to be crazy when we go do this thing.
[228:56.16]And then it cuts to black and then there's ads for five minutes.
[228:58.75]And then they come back and Peter's like, Lois, the crazy thing we're about to do is now starting.
[229:06.29]TV figured this out a long time ago, and I don't know why the internet decided that they were just not gonna do it this way.
[229:12.21]that you have these ways that it segues into when these things are going to happen.
[229:22.54]When you know that ads are going to come, when you're aware of them and you know it's not going to ruin any content, you don't really care that much more than you would the other way.
[229:30.89]Now, what if when Peter Griffin was in the middle of fighting the chicken, it just cut to a soup ad?
[229:37.90]It just cut to it.
[229:40.36]Peter didn't say, chicken, you just, I don't know.
[229:43.91]And then the music cue to black.
[229:47.31]If he just, it just went to an ad in the middle of him fighting the chicken.
[229:49.72]It's jarring.
[229:53.20]And TV figured that out a long time ago, even back in the radio days.
[229:59.33]So I don't know, the internet just decided at some point 10, 15 years ago that it was just like, no, just put them fucking everywhere and make them random.
[230:07.04]Like, well, that's why everybody hates it and why everybody uses Adblock and why nobody wants to actually sit through them.
[230:18.88]You have to do Peter Griffin for your ad breaks now.
[230:29.09]tools that let you figure out the ads that are coming up from one to five minutes and snooze exists.
[230:33.26]That problem with the snooze though is that sometimes that's not long enough.
[230:36.79]You know, sometimes five minutes is not long enough, and you only get to do that a few times before it's on cooldown.
[230:43.81]If they didn't go on cooldown, then I wouldn't have a problem with it.
[230:46.69]But the fact that I think you can only do it three times before you're not allowed to do it again for a while.
[230:58.61]Bring back the infomercials.
[231:01.58]You get five minutes of snooze per 60 minutes.
[231:03.99]Right, so what if it doesn't line up correctly in that hour?
[231:10.42]And I'm not trying to be, let's talk about ads.
[231:14.17]But I have thought about it since I've stopped doing it.
[231:17.30]And it was, did people want them back because it was better?
[231:20.19]Because they didn't get hit with pre-rolls or...
[231:24.14]And I'm still trying to figure that out to this day.
[231:31.11]But anyways, no more talk about that.
[231:38.87]We're done speaking of this.
[231:40.32]I am now going to go back to the shotgun guy and I'm going to get my shotgun repaired and fixed and ready to use.
[231:58.99]Where is he?
[231:59.47]Over here.
[232:04.98]That's my friend.
[232:16.44]I didn't get hit by it.
[232:17.56]I didn't get hit by it.
[232:26.92]And I ran by the workshop.
[232:31.45]I got hit by...
[232:32.09]I double tapped myself.
[232:33.80]I'm almost dead.
[232:43.35]Oh, that's hard.
[232:51.09]What does that even mean?
[233:06.77]Oh, you can save the shells.
[233:08.26]He can fix them.
[233:16.70]I got so many rounds in this thing now.
[233:28.56]Gonna buy bullets.
[233:30.95]Alright, how we doing on this?
[233:34.85]This is fine.
[233:40.81]What about health?
[233:42.49]I need to redo my health section here.
[233:45.91]I got cheese.
[233:46.53]No, this is fine.
[233:48.21]Antidotes.
[233:48.80]Alright.
[233:50.10]I got my shock and hazard look.
[233:53.03]Oh, this thing is sick.
[233:56.15]I want to test it.
[234:10.63]He said it was astonishingly loud.
[234:13.89]You don't use that term unless it's loud.
[234:25.66]It's got a huge kickback too.
[234:28.12]How many bolts can it hold?
[234:29.30]Two?
[234:33.20]Okay.
[234:42.79]I need to...
[234:48.11]I need to die.
[234:56.23]Oh, I can just do this.
[235:00.77]I could put that torch on too.
[235:25.18]Alright, we're good.
[235:31.36]Make sure it's loaded.
[235:33.59]I want to buy bullets for the other gun and we're going back to the sewers.
[235:39.88]How long is the rest of the game?
[235:40.86]I think we're about halfway through.
[235:42.87]I think this is the halfway point, effectively, where I am right now.
[235:54.49]I have enough bullets, I think.
[236:01.72]I'll probably finish it in the next two streams of the game, I would imagine.
[236:05.74]Something like that.
[236:14.04]What about Jerma's daughter or Vinny's son?
[236:18.57]Hmm...
[236:20.28]I'm gonna...
[236:21.00]I...
[236:21.54]I don't know.
[236:41.66]Ster Daughter or Poke Son?
[236:45.73]I think I'm going with Poke on that one.
[236:50.77]I feel like, I feel like sun, if you poke, sun is like chill.
[236:55.94]I feel like that's a chill, dude.
[237:04.64]I feel like Poke's son would just kind of be like, yeah, what are we doing?
[237:08.91]I'm into it, whatever.
[237:10.08]I'm just here for the fun.
[237:23.44]Okay.
[237:30.14]Look out!
[237:31.39]Oh my god, actually look out!
[237:38.33]What do you mean there's nothing in the toilet?
[237:41.42]Somebody just exploded again.
[237:42.64]I may have broken the game there.
[237:46.41]I don't know what happened, but whatever.
[237:48.76]Alright, here we go.
[237:49.54]Next room.
[237:50.23]What do we got?
[237:51.68]Weirdo on the ceiling.
[237:58.93]He did say this is really loud though.
[238:00.38]Maybe I don't do that unless I have to.
[238:18.88]Didn't you say you like debate though?
[238:20.39]I feel like you debate with Ster daughter a lot.
[238:23.48]I'd like a very certain kind of debate, like what kind of cereal you like, and how fast do you think, um...
[238:33.36]I don't know, how fast do you think?
[238:35.12]Wait a minute, I can't, we can't do this right now.
[238:38.87]Well, get off, just get down!
[238:41.96]I threw that into the other room, dude.
[238:45.87]You're getting fucking shotgunned.
[238:54.11]Whatever.
[239:02.38]That guy reminds me of the alligators.
[239:03.79]When you see the alligator from under the water when they're just kind of chilling and floating around.
[239:29.35]This shotgun is crazy.
[239:35.35]Rare bit?
[239:45.38]Alright.
[239:52.85]I need the shotgun for this one for sure.
[240:00.30]Whoa!
[240:10.88]Shotgun is so good.
[240:12.15]I'm so glad I went projectiles.
[240:16.95]You excited for the FNAF 2 movie?
[240:19.26]No.
[240:20.95]No, not at all.
[240:22.73]I don't do anything.
[240:24.06]I don't watch anything.
[240:32.65]I have to upgrade something.
[240:34.78]It's probably going to be the projectile outfit.
[241:05.21]You are still alive.
[241:06.95]Oh boy, wait a minute.
[241:15.56]Why would I throw the flame thing at the guy that is made out of flame?
[241:20.38]I have one shotgun shell left?
[241:21.94]This is bad?
[241:22.53]Since when?
[241:26.66]How do you miss between them?
[241:28.25]I kicked a field goal!
[241:31.25]Oh my god.
[241:31.98]Hold on.
[241:42.41]What the fuck?
[241:43.88]Why?
[241:44.72]How are you still alive?
[241:51.38]Finally, Jesus!
[242:01.44]I got plenty of money now.
[242:12.14]I can't put this lantern down yet.
[242:15.41]Uh, flamethrower guy's son or ceiling crawling initiate witch daughter?
[242:23.60]I don't know, dude.
[242:26.13]That's difficult.
[242:37.27]I didn't get something else.
[242:38.57]Wait, here it is.
[242:42.81]Alright, well, this is where I'm all this led to being here.
[242:46.45]Basement bathroom.
[242:48.86]There's some dickhead in here too.
[242:50.81]Yep.
[242:51.29]I don't think I can kill this guy.
[242:55.71]I'm gonna have to beat this guy.
[242:56.78]Wait, I have the bayonet.
[242:59.66]I have poison.
[243:01.11]I'll try poison.
[243:17.62]I don't think this guy can be poisoned.
[243:27.66]What about curse?
[243:30.28]He can definitely be cursed.
[243:33.82]It's too bad I have no more of that.
[243:36.94]What about an enchantment?
[243:53.05]No, he's gotta be a projectile.
[244:00.34]Please don't kill me.
[244:08.58]I'm kind of screwed.
[244:14.21]Summon spears.
[244:15.70]OK, hold on.
[244:16.52]I could do book and then spears.
[244:24.46]It's almost bleeding too.
[244:25.54]That's annoying.
[244:28.88]Get out of the way.
[244:33.50]Will you move?
[244:34.23]Why is he...
[244:40.78]He's just gonna camp here?
[244:59.96]Give me the spear's book.
[245:05.35]Good, okay.
[245:06.42]Now shoot him, book.
[245:14.17]Shoot him!
[245:19.07]Nice job.
[245:20.98]Finally.
[245:21.50]Alright, so...
[245:24.77]Sickle.
[245:28.90]Actually good to get that.
[245:30.08]There's nothing in the toilet.
[245:32.13]OK, so I've pretty much cleared everything.
[245:40.26]Oh, right, I gotta round this.
[245:41.85]I'm not fucking with that guy.
[245:45.32]What the fuck?
[245:53.17]I'm safe in here for a minute.
[245:59.55]clear the bong next?
[246:02.32]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[246:04.19]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[246:07.93]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[246:14.60]Balfondler's son or Kefir guy daughter.
[246:20.96]Nah, that's... that's...
[246:22.64]I think that's Kefir guy, daughter.
[246:26.58]Balfondler's son just never quits, always wants to be noticed in the chat forever.
[246:33.42]Even if we've moved on a thousand times.
[246:35.65]Not Balfondler himself, but Balfondler's son.
[246:38.78]Eh, I don't know about that.
[246:51.13]I think I'm safe.
[246:57.05]Well, why would I do that?
[246:57.86]That was dumb.
[246:58.38]Oh.
[247:01.72]Another messenger from the Wretch King.
[247:04.99]I'm not leaving.
[247:05.80]The poorly creatures down here need me.
[247:09.04]They have sought refuge from the Wretch King in these fetid waters.
[247:14.26]He can't just erase everything from the dream that he doesn't like.
[247:17.15]I won't allow it.
[247:18.46]I am a witch, and my name is Josette.
[247:21.53]You're a witch, aren't you?
[247:22.37]I can sense it.
[247:25.42]I know you must play the part of errand girl to gain his trust.
[247:29.24]Surely you can appreciate he is a wicked man.
[247:31.19]I see you've brought an eviction letter.
[247:35.30]Is this letter safe for me to open?
[247:40.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, safe.
[247:42.83]Open it, open it.
[247:50.74]Should I... What do you guys think?
[247:53.08]I'll let you guys choose this.
[247:58.21]Let her open the letter and burn the witch or no.
[248:05.55]I'll let you pick because I think it is a choice either way.
[248:09.71]I think it's a choice either way.
[248:14.26]If you're not a magic guy, then yes.
[248:21.87]Do you get magic?
[248:22.67]Oh, you get spells, I think, from her.
[248:26.53]Do we get a gun?
[248:27.23]Wait, does it mean we get gun stuff if we let her open it?
[248:33.01]Open it yourself.
[248:37.26]I could.
[248:43.05]The other guy does seem like a gun guy.
[248:45.14]Yeah.
[248:47.03]She's useful, though.
[248:49.97]I believe... Shite.
[248:57.43]I thought we were watching MST3K for a second.
[248:59.86]You know, actually, I brought up in the horseman group
[249:04.65]If they wanted to do an MST3K thing.
[249:08.43]Where we just watch an old movie and just talk shit over it.
[249:13.41]It seemed like that would be, it was kind of fun.
[249:17.68]It would just be a rip-off, absolutely.
[249:18.89]It would just be like, hey, we're going to do that because I thought that was such a great, fun, amazing show.
[249:25.96]directly inspired by that.
[249:32.44]Cathy Mitchell mother or Bob Ross father?
[249:34.75]Cathy Mitchell mother.
[249:37.35]And there's actually not much that could go against Cathy Mitchell, mother.
[249:40.85]Or Kathy, hold on.
[249:46.23]Cathy Mitchell's son.
[249:49.40]Alright, never mind.
[249:50.69]I don't care.
[249:51.15]Cathy Mitchell's awesome.
[249:58.04]Because like, okay, what I'm describing is like somebody that like, oh, I thought then Cathy Mitchell is great.
[250:07.27]Oh, my God.
[250:15.66]Okay, normal daughter or regular son?
[250:19.13]Normal daughter.
[250:22.21]If your son has to be...
[250:23.83]I don't know.
[250:24.18]If your son is a regular son... No, no, no.
[250:27.19]That's abnormal.
[250:29.46]I'll take the normal daughter, please.
[250:32.11]Somebody that classifies themselves as a regular guy, regular son.
[250:35.81]Uh-uh.
[250:37.78]No.
[250:38.42]Normal daughter, please.
[250:43.87]Thank you.
[250:50.15]normal son versus regular daughter.
[250:53.36]Hmm.
[250:58.66]That is hard.
[251:01.40]That's actually hard.
[251:08.65]Are you opening the letter or not?
[251:14.56]No, you guys chose no.
[251:17.19]Right?
[251:17.75]Yeah.
[251:18.77]The letter is not safe for you to open.
[251:21.59]I knew there was a trick.
[251:22.42]Thank you for your honesty.
[251:23.89]Ashes, right?
[251:29.29]The ashes of a witch being slightly cursed are not too dissimilar from spectral remains.
[251:34.28]Ghosts are pretty rare these days, but there are still a few up in the attic.
[251:39.28]The attic is a truly cursed place.
[251:41.30]Something horrible happened up there, but I'm not sure what.
[251:44.27]Bring me some spectral remains and I'll put the finishing touches on the fool... on that fool, the wretch.
[251:52.31]Now I'd like to reward you for not letting me
[251:54.18]That looks like a chocolate donut.
[252:05.08]Ooh, I used it often when traversing the Byzantine labyrinth beneath the mansion.
[252:09.30]What do you get for not doing it?
[252:10.55]Like, what do you get for her opening it?
[252:13.41]Fart daughter versus shart son.
[252:16.28]Shart son.
[252:17.47]Fart daughter I think is, no.
[252:19.07]That's a shart son for 100%.
[252:23.93]but now I must tend to my flock here in the basement and have little need of it.
[252:33.33]I think I have some, don't I?
[252:36.79]Shit, I don't.
[252:37.88]You get it from taking pictures of ghosts?
[252:41.65]I'm sorry.
[252:50.76]Tuna melt son or buffalo chicken daughter?
[252:52.94]Buffalo chicken daughter.
[253:03.14]Yeah, there's not.
[253:03.91]I don't think there's even a question on that one.
[253:07.34]Tuna Melt Sun would be.
[253:11.77]I feel like you can really like, wait, let's go get Buffalo chicken.
[253:15.52]And she's so excited.
[253:17.22]She's like, yeah, I can't wait.
[253:18.71]And you get to share that.
[253:19.93]Oh, it's kind of spicy.
[253:21.44]Ooh, but look, a tuna melt's kind of like a...
[253:24.91]Here you go.
[253:25.37]Here you go, kid.
[253:26.86]Here you go, son.
[253:27.44]We both like this, I guess.
[253:29.55]Buffalo chicken daughter is you celebrate that meal, right?
[253:32.23]You don't really celebrate the tuna melt meal.
[253:34.24]You will celebrate the Buffalo chicken meal.
[253:43.88]Okay, I'm gonna...
[253:47.03]I'm gonna go back to...
[253:48.52]I don't have any picture...
[253:50.00]I don't...
[253:50.54]Camera.
[253:50.94]Where's the camera?
[253:52.37]I have one shot with the camera.
[253:55.65]I need a ghost.
[253:58.80]You are the tuna melt sun.
[254:00.28]Exactly.
[254:00.70]So I'm telling you, it's not really something to celebrate.
[254:03.33]When I have buffalo chicken, it is a wowee.
[254:05.90]This is a time to celebrate.
[254:07.11]This is awesome.
[254:08.65]I love tuna and I love tuna melts, but it's not a celebratory thing.
[254:28.92]I don't really want to activate this yet.
[254:32.75]Okay, this is the unlock.
[254:34.30]This goes up to the attic.
[254:37.27]Let me try to get...
[254:38.94]The hell is that?
[254:41.16]I want to try to get one picture of a ghost.
[254:49.25]I'll read all this later don't worry.
[254:58.69]That happens up here too?
[255:07.01]Are you a ghost?
[255:08.69]No.
[255:13.59]There's mirrors everywhere.
[255:20.20]This area is just anti... Oh, that's good.
[255:27.04]Oh!
[255:43.00]No, close this.
[255:56.60]That's actually crazy.
[256:00.23]You can like spam moves.
[256:03.20]Are you a ghost?
[256:05.15]I don't think either of these are ghosts.
[256:15.30]Loot run.
[256:16.44]Awarding cupcake.
[256:21.11]Kind of useful.
[256:24.45]I just want a picture of a ghost.
[256:28.40]Oh, Jesus.
[256:32.39]I don't think that was a ghost.
[256:34.40]I don't think that's a ghost.
[256:36.01]Is it a ghost?
[256:38.40]Ow!
[256:44.68]I don't think that's a ghost.
[256:45.82]I think that's just a...
[256:47.21]It's a ghoul.
[256:50.85]Health charm?
[256:51.65]Oh, hell yeah.
[256:52.13]I don't want to die.
[256:52.57]I don't want to lose all these.
[256:54.06]Bye.
[256:56.04]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, don't move.
[257:04.34]I can't craft?
[257:17.69]You see that, Dodge?
[257:19.35]Whoa.
[257:22.47]I'm in so much trouble.
[257:23.90]I have to shoot a firework at him.
[257:32.18]I wasn't prepared to be up here yet.
[257:36.23]But dying would be very bad right now.
[257:41.90]I'm not prepared for this.
[257:42.74]Is somebody dropping keys everywhere?
[257:49.87]What is going on?
[257:54.96]I am not ready for this.
[258:02.73]No.
[258:04.86]No.
[258:16.53]Upper banquet hall.
[258:21.48]This is a bad idea.
[258:25.03]I... Bad idea.
[258:32.09]I just needed a picture of a ghost and I couldn't even get that.
[258:36.02]I had to go back to nowhere.
[258:43.34]Don't get up, please.
[258:44.27]I hope they don't attack.
[258:45.43]I don't think they do.
[258:50.60]She sells...
[258:54.38]Necromancer's Ring.
[258:59.43]That's awesome.
[259:05.64]Oh, you can take these drugs to do more projectile damage.
[259:08.75]That's kind of awesome.
[259:10.39]Weird pill.
[259:12.76]Lead resist.
[259:13.66]Chromatic ring.
[259:17.57]That's cool.
[259:25.28]That's really cool.
[259:31.20]I want it
[259:39.72]I think that's just a thing to scare you.
[259:40.99]I don't think it actually does anything.
[259:45.76]It doesn't, right?
[259:48.97]Oh my lord.
[259:50.10]Ah.
[259:52.95]Does this do any- Ah!
[259:53.64]Does this do anything?
[259:58.07]Armor spell, yeah.
[260:05.14]I'm getting out of here.
[260:09.14]Actually, you should have just come with me.
[260:12.29]You can just be like bait for everything else that's attacking me.
[260:18.20]Ketchup son or ketchup daughter?
[260:22.36]Oh.
[260:23.77]Ketchup, son.
[260:25.90]It's K-E-T-C-H-U-U-P.
[260:34.75]I have plenty of candles.
[260:35.58]I don't need to do that.
[260:37.25]Uh, does this count?
[260:38.62]Where is he?
[260:49.97]That's a good one.
[260:51.64]Where is he?
[260:54.83]I don't think it counts.
[260:57.61]Because I didn't get the ashes.
[261:12.55]Some cheese.
[261:15.91]I need more, I'm gonna sell some shit.
[261:17.46]Sorry for the deception.
[261:18.34]These are dangerous times, and I like to observe new customers before revealing myself.
[261:25.45]Groomio is just a puppet.
[261:26.79]Although I spend so much time alone here, I sometimes talk to him.
[261:31.05]I am the last witch.
[261:33.36]The name is a bit grandiose, but if Samantha gets to be the first witch, why can't I be the last?
[261:38.84]You see, I was the last person to join the Sororal Order of the Initiated in 1910 before Marston Asylum closed.
[261:46.45]I've been hiding out here since the Wretch King decided to eradicate witches from the dream.
[261:52.36]My only customers these days are you and the odd member of the merry band.
[261:57.96]Most of the other witches followed Millie on some secret quest.
[262:02.50]Something about finding the last idol before Robert does.
[262:06.00]Oops, always talking too much.
[262:07.67]Anyway, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.
[262:14.82]I didn't really want to in the first place.
[262:17.92]I was trying to sell
[262:23.77]I have a lot of healing tonic.
[262:25.75]That's good.
[262:33.49]I don't know if you can repair this stuff.
[262:39.85]Look at all these goodies I have.
[262:41.36]If I die, I'm gonna be so mad.
[262:43.60]That'd be the saddest thing ever.
[262:48.25]What is it even a picture of?
[262:58.22]So...
[263:08.33]Oh, it's that one.
[263:16.08]That's kind of a creepy picture.
[263:18.76]That's the big lady's arm.
[263:27.79]I got plenty of health.
[263:28.77]Let me actually fix that.
[263:30.86]I need to go redo the shotgun shells.
[263:35.98]Give me the armor.
[263:38.72]And give me the spears too, it's actually pretty useful.
[263:41.74]And the heal maybe, yeah.
[263:48.36]Yeah.
[263:51.74]That's a good one too.
[263:56.31]Hey, I'm leaving in 40 minutes.
[263:57.37]It's been 50 minutes.
[263:58.31]I guess the vibes have been repaired.
[263:59.96]Don't remind him.
[264:01.40]Oh, the vibes have been great forever today.
[264:15.71]Too easy.
[264:17.06]I actually was about to leave.
[264:23.53]You were right, but not quite right, because I want to finish this.
[264:31.41]I want to finish this little thing I'm doing, otherwise I will forget the next time I start it.
[264:42.55]How much money does it cost to do this?
[264:50.02]I don't even...
[264:50.44]I might as well just run by every single one of them now.
[265:00.65]Okay, it's...
[265:04.06]Very nice.
[265:04.60]I need 10 coins.
[265:13.11]Or I need... Wretch.
[265:15.84]Now that we have a functional implementation of the farm,
[265:18.62]There is no longer any need for the copies of Mostenhaus.
[265:23.12]Please see that the idols from each copy are taken to the tower.
[265:27.26]Afterward, destroy the cable cars and seal the tunnel entrances.
[265:32.00]Inform me immediately of any issues you encounter.
[265:34.81]And that was by Robert Baratheon.
[265:37.25]Robert Baratheon
[265:43.73]House Baratheon.
[265:46.73]Why am I doing a Game of Thrones thing?
[265:48.02]That's weird.
[266:02.94]Okay.
[266:05.41]Camera is loaded.
[266:06.66]I need a picture of a ghost.
[266:12.02]Let's go find a ghost in the attic apparently.
[266:16.68]I could just get it from anywhere.
[266:20.25]I am, it startles me every time and I just don't even pay any attention.
[266:34.12]You scared the shit out of me dude.
[266:53.63]I need a picture of a ghost.
[267:00.70]I hate that the...
[267:01.50]I need... my actual lantern.
[267:09.35]Is this thing loaded?
[267:22.96]I think I got him.
[267:35.51]What is happening?
[267:38.14]What's happening?
[267:45.13]Oh my god, I'm rotted.
[267:57.77]Give me some of that dust!
[268:01.85]Uh-oh!
[268:08.59]Why is there a fire alarm?
[268:10.48]I can't- Why can't I get a picture of you?
[268:15.98]Go in!
[268:18.14]Why could I not get a picture?
[268:19.12]The picture didn't work.
[268:35.66]Rule of thirds, dude.
[268:42.02]I...
[268:42.26]I...
[268:45.16]God damn it.
[268:46.68]Okay.
[268:47.95]You- I'm just gonna kill you.
[268:49.72]You know what?
[268:51.73]Fuck you.
[268:53.78]This thing has a million health.
[268:57.17]Two shotgun shots?
[268:59.00]Three?
[269:07.97]Don't touch it.
[269:11.05]Okay, well I got that rid of that.
[269:12.90]This thing is just...
[269:14.06]I gotta put on curse armor.
[269:22.01]This is poison.
[269:22.96]I'll put the health one on.
[269:24.92]This is less poison.
[269:28.41]Curse tolerance.
[269:33.13]Says none.
[269:36.68]Yeah, boom.
[269:43.29]And then the rings too.
[269:44.28]I got that much better rings for this.
[269:48.07]That can stay on.
[269:53.35]That's kind of good too.
[270:01.82]Curse Tolerance.
[270:03.47]Yeah.
[270:03.95]Curse Tolerance up.
[270:08.64]Take the poison thing off.
[270:11.57]Cursed tolerance.
[270:15.01]Less curse damage.
[270:16.32]Max curse tolerance?
[270:17.71]Yeah.
[270:25.65]Better.
[270:26.75]Now I can actually like go in here.
[270:31.64]Alright, get the camera ready.
[270:37.09]You know what?
[270:37.67]I might as well just feed you out here and kill you.
[270:43.29]I really don't want to... Oh my god, dude.
[270:48.41]I don't wanna use the gun for this.
[270:50.74]Give me the where's the there it is bayonet.
[271:05.14]Wuthering's son or Ruum's daughter?
[271:21.13]I know, I'm taking a ton of curse damage, but at least I can take a lot of hits.
[271:27.85]Okay.
[271:28.77]Okay!
[271:32.42]Thank you.
[271:46.73]I might just take this and run in there.
[271:50.76]And then just try to get as many pictures as I can of the cursed people.
[271:59.91]Alright, ready?
[272:00.68]That's the... Let's go.
[272:11.54]I got you.
[272:16.39]Got it.
[272:26.00]Turn this in.
[272:29.66]What do you bring to the cookout?
[272:30.76]I would bring... ...egg salad.
[272:35.25]Or, I'd be the guy that brings the single, non-family-sized bag of Lay's potato chips.
[272:43.01]Thanks, bro.
[272:45.04]Appreciate it.
[273:01.79]This guy blows up every time I open the door.
[273:14.16]In the revised 1916 edition of Ponser's Chess, two additional afflictions have been introduced.
[273:22.95]uh it is necrosis which is max health permanently permanently reduced that's not good and then terror is fear so they have added fear
[273:32.89]Fear mechanic.
[273:38.49]Corpse Hex Book.
[273:41.25]Well, there's your corpse explosion.
[273:42.81]The guy that made that joke yesterday.
[273:45.53]That book is for you.
[273:54.29]Alright, I'm back.
[274:03.99]I'm here to give you the ashes, to get the thing, to bring to the guy, to get the completion.
[274:13.73]Just a moment.
[274:15.86]Here we go.
[274:16.30]Fake witch ashes.
[274:17.49]He'll be unable to tell the difference.
[274:19.84]I'm afraid I have little else to offer, but you will always have my thanks for my life.
[274:28.65]Got anything else here?
[274:31.77]Any snacks?
[274:38.03]Let's teleport out of here.
[274:47.40]Can we gamble?
[274:48.75]What would you gamble on?
[274:51.13]Nothing to gamble on right now.
[274:57.39]Alright.
[275:02.15]Now I got to go to here is good.
[275:14.06]Don't, don't, don't.
[275:15.15]Ooh.
[275:17.57]Hey.
[275:25.72]Not this time.
[275:27.83]Ooh.
[275:28.52]Resistance charm?
[275:30.53]Alright, if I actually die, this would be pretty bad, considering.
[275:36.40]Because not only all these rings...
[275:39.42]but all of these would be gone.
[275:44.74]10% max health, max curse, 5 max bleed, 25% luck, 10% projectile damage.
[275:51.81]This would be bad if these all were gone.
[275:58.54]Games like these, if you actually, you know, if you start hoarding and then you die, it stinks.
[276:06.81]Uh-oh!
[276:09.64]Uh...
[276:11.92]Wait a second, I think I fucked this up big time.
[276:14.85]I walked in here with a witch's outfit on.
[276:16.64]I was supposed to be a nurse.
[276:18.45]Were you not aware of the lengths I've gone to, how much effort I put to eradicating witches?
[276:23.75]Why did I walk in here with a Halloween costume of the thing this guy hates the most?
[276:28.71]Oh no!
[276:30.00]I was completing the quest!
[276:42.47]Oh my god, I have to put on the fucking witch outfit.
[276:50.99]I'm wearing a Ghost of Christmas Past cloak.
[276:54.85]That's the worst thing to wear in front of the guy that hates Christmas and hates ghosts.
[277:01.55]Actually, what the hell have I done here?
[277:02.72]I don't know.
[277:03.46]I don't know what the fuck I did.
[277:08.11]Where the hell am I?
[277:20.59]There's some good shit up here, though.
[277:22.78]Secret passage.
[277:23.59]Wait a minute.
[277:24.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[277:26.00]Somebody up here.
[277:34.71]I can see a certain look of concern on your face.
[277:38.07]Is it concern for me, a skeleton hanging by her hands?
[277:43.77]or concern for yourself who has found herself in this dreadful place?
[277:49.26]Well, no need to worry about me.
[277:53.21]Hanging stretches out my old wounds.
[277:56.14]I'm Gertrude, the witch.
[277:59.00]The wretch king locked me up when he caught me sneaking around looking for supplies.
[278:04.38]Say, since you seem to be a witch, how'd you like to improve your skills?
[278:08.33]I'm a top shelf witch trainer, certified by the first witch herself long ago.
[278:12.65]If you ever want to level up, just give me an offering.
[278:15.93]I also have spellcasting tools, too.
[278:18.57]Place the coins in my pocket and pull what you bought out of my sack.
[278:23.89]Oh, Nightingale, did I fool you?
[278:25.63]It's me, the last witch.
[278:27.44]This is another one of my puppets.
[278:29.39]I used to use her as a spy in the mansion.
[278:31.46]but I found it too taxing remotely controlling her from nowhere.
[278:35.61]I let her get caught by the Wretch King so I could help anybody else who got locked up.
[278:44.30]Uh, this is a lot.
[278:53.01]You can do so much spell damage, it's crazy.
[278:57.37]Blindfold?
[279:03.24]I kinda want it.
[279:08.57]This is a bigger candle.
[279:12.22]Okay.
[279:20.09]I don't know what that offering does.
[279:23.34]I don't want to use these.
[279:25.16]I might need them.
[279:30.83]Well, that's kind of cool.
[279:34.12]Can I change my outfit and just go back to where I was?
[279:37.41]Where does this even go?
[279:43.33]What?
[279:44.89]Oh my god, that person was huge.
[279:50.74]Okay, I think I'm fine.
[279:52.13]Alright, nurse uniform.
[279:54.19]I hope I didn't softlock that ability to do that.
[280:00.39]Do I get sent to the- sent there on site?
[280:02.69]That'd be bad.
[280:03.25]I hope not.
[280:03.59]I hope it's just like a funny little haha look you get sent there thing.
[280:14.69]I can take it now.
[280:17.80]We good?
[280:23.76]Alright we're good.
[280:25.98]That loathsome witch was stinking up my basement.
[280:29.07]For your reward, I shall grant you a moderate amount of freedom.
[280:33.34]Behold the advanced wretch pass.
[280:36.12]With this, you can exit the back door of the mansion.
[280:39.76]I do have a final request of you.
[280:42.72]In the valley below the mansion, there is a pretender to the throne.
[280:46.51]A peasant has declared himself king and has several witches in his thrall.
[280:51.96]Let him pretend.
[280:53.59]But do I care about one witch he has shackled?
[280:57.58]She is a creature of tremendous power and will be of great use to me.
[281:01.28]You'll find her chained up in the valley, although I suspect the false king won't make it easy.
[281:07.03]Open this wretch teleportation spell in front of her and she'll be sent straight here.
[281:12.84]You'll be handsomely rewarded for your troubles.
[281:17.88]Interesting.
[281:20.95]Find a chained witch somewhere in the valley.
[281:23.97]Are you dense?
[281:26.18]Find a chained up witch.
[281:27.80]Use the teleportation scroll.
[281:29.55]Now be gone.
[281:34.67]And that is gonna wrap up the stream.
[281:40.68]Maybe in five more minutes.
[281:51.46]Let me look at the big map.
[281:55.67]OK.
[281:58.14]I can go.
[281:59.00]There's the roof thing.
[282:00.44]There was something weird on the roof.
[282:06.18]is leaving the house entirely and going out here right or out the front door whatever it was
[282:16.17]I could go explore the attic a little more.
[282:18.46]It is dangerous and scary, but there's probably something up there.
[282:28.67]I don't know where I want to go, but I know I want to go back to nowhere.
[282:31.27]I might actually reset...
[282:36.34]The day?
[282:37.10]Because I really want more... What the hell is that?
[282:43.53]Ow!
[282:44.14]It hurts you.
[282:44.70]I thought they were just illusions.
[283:03.69]I need way more jars.
[283:04.96]I need more bullets too.
[283:06.00]I gotta just make money.
[283:08.82]Really low on everything.
[283:14.79]I kind of need to go to the attic and actually kill this stuff and maybe even reset the day.
[283:18.90]There's also the labyrinth underneath as well.
[283:26.72]Your dad has been paying all... You got sniped.
[283:30.55]Your dad's been paying... We're happy this is over.
[283:40.39]Imagine being like a paid chatter.
[283:51.09]Like, you're paid to sit here and watch this.
[283:59.70]We don't have to imagine.
[284:01.00]No need to do that.
[284:03.62]Paid chatter.
[284:10.58]I'm being held hostage here.
[284:17.14]Alright, well...
[284:18.34]Uh, thanks for hanging out.
[284:21.00]Thanks for hanging out.
[284:23.10]Had a good time?
[284:24.35]I'm gonna keep playing this.
[284:25.89]I will finish this.
[284:28.05]This might be a...
[284:32.02]I don't know.
[284:33.70]There will be no stream tomorrow.
[284:36.07]That is for certain.
[284:38.06]There will be no stream the day after that either.
[284:43.61]We're looking at it, because I do want to get this finished soon.
[284:47.95]Because it's kind of right in the middle of my mind.
[284:50.66]We're thinking either a Tuesday or Wednesday scenario to keep going with this.
[284:56.68]Plan on Wednesday.
[284:58.65]I might start with something else and then move to this and have this be kind of the end of the second half of the stream game.
[285:05.43]or I might just open with it and just keep going.
[285:09.63]But yeah, we're pretty much at the 50% point right now.
[285:15.20]So there's at least another two or three streams of this game.
[285:20.43]Take care of yourselves.
[285:21.49]Good night.
[285:22.05]The game is saved.
[285:22.80]Don't worry.
[285:26.91]See you later.
[285:28.38]Have a great rest of your evening.
[285:35.50]Yeah, and the whole ad thing too, we'll figure that out.
[285:37.87]Maybe I'll try it next time to see if it works.
[285:42.25]do the three minute break things where we just, this is nothing happening.
[285:47.19]Or just keep it like this.
[285:50.82]send everybody to Vinny oh Vinny's um Sunday stream is he doing it right now did he start
[286:02.04]he did I'll send you to Vinny
[286:13.87]He's looking at cursed comics right now.
[286:17.99]Let's go find out.
[286:22.66]But yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[286:23.87]Thanks for watching.
[286:24.39]Thanks for hanging out.
[286:25.12]We'll see you in a few days.
[286:26.08]Withering Rooms will continue.
[286:34.04]For a second, I was like, what is happening?
[286:40.41]I'll put this on mute because I don't want two songs playing at the same time.
[286:49.34]And I will see you later.
[286:50.97]Goodbye.
[286:55.23]See you, see you.
[287:03.89]Thank you.
