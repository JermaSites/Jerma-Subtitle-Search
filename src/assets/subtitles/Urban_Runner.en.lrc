[00:02.46]Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.
[00:04.48]I had a lot of candy today.
[00:05.88]I had like two candies today.
[00:07.26]Two Twix bars.
[00:09.14]I am pumped up.
[00:10.90]I'm freaking out right now.
[00:22.53]So ready.
[00:24.83]I'm so ready.
[00:27.71]Hi, guys.
[00:30.07]How's everybody doing?
[00:32.02]Welcome to, uh, mid-August.
[00:36.24]As they call them, the dog days of summer.
[00:40.32]And we're getting to a close here.
[00:41.64]Summertime's about to be over.
[00:42.90]A few more weeks.
[00:46.97]And then back to school!
[00:48.57]No!
[00:49.47]I don't want to go to math class!
[00:51.81]No!
[00:53.37]Alright, I'll see you in a minute.
[01:26.99]Alright, so today we have the pleasure of playing a game called Urban Runner, which is an old FMV game by the title, you probably saw the title already.
[01:39.34]This game, we might be done with this game in 30 minutes.
[01:42.46]Or we might sit here and play the whole thing, I don't know.
[01:46.24]I can't tell you.
[01:47.16]But I can tell you there's a couple of things we do need to talk about.
[01:50.26]They're very, very important.
[01:53.09]So I'm gonna just give it a second for people to trickle in before we talk about these few things.
[01:59.59]So, okay.
[02:02.39]Let's count.
[02:03.75]On our wrists, on our wrists, on our wrists, on our wrists, not on the chat room.
[02:10.23]Not in the box where you type things.
[02:16.00]How are the wasps?
[02:16.66]The wasps seem to be gone.
[02:19.50]I don't, I have not seen one since we had that problem.
[02:25.16]I know, I'm just... Sometimes I don't think before I talk.
[02:29.58]Happens quite frequently, actually.
[02:31.01]But yeah, no more wasps.
[02:32.25]We're good to go.
[02:36.75]At least, I think we are.
[02:37.63]Although I say that now, and I could foresee a situation where... If I turn around and there's like two behind me, that would happen.
[02:48.04]It's alright, though.
[02:50.72]I'm looking forward...
[02:54.44]to getting out of here and over this place.
[02:58.76]Yes, chat just broke.
[03:00.39]I don't know why.
[03:02.15]I was trying to figure that out silently.
[03:07.39]Why can no one talk?
[03:08.73]Why is it only mods talking?
[03:13.32]What?
[03:13.60]Okay, that was weird.
[03:17.02]That was very strange.
[03:18.24]You guys just clogged a drain with your emotes.
[03:23.83]And then a plumber came in and dumped shit down there and now you can talk again.
[03:27.73]That was really weird.
[03:30.09]Well, off to a great start today, Twitch.
[03:31.61]Hopefully this doesn't fuck up again.
[03:34.63]But... So, let's talk about this now.
[03:38.71]As you know, I'm moving to Las Vegas.
[03:41.15]And those debts are being paid.
[03:44.15]I owe a lot of money to a casino.
[03:47.84]So, I'm going to have to take a stream sabbatical.
[03:54.09]And what that means is in a couple weeks here, you might not see me for like two weeks.
[04:02.17]It's gonna take a little while.
[04:03.97]I'm going to try to split it up so that doesn't happen.
[04:06.92]But there are two Vegas trips here.
[04:10.10]There's one coming up in the next couple weeks where I have to go and actually sign papers.
[04:15.96]Right?
[04:16.54]I'm not actually moving in because I can't.
[04:19.92]Moving across the country is really funky.
[04:22.16]Because you can't just do it all in one go.
[04:25.22]I can't just stay out there for a month.
[04:27.24]In like a fucking hotel.
[04:28.99]It costs like 15 grand.
[04:31.37]So I'm going to go out there.
[04:33.79]Sign papers.
[04:35.01]Come back.
[04:36.11]get this place gone, actually completely remove this place from my life, and then another week is going to have to go by where I don't stream because I'm moving out there.
[04:46.66]So, it's not going to be consecutive, not two weeks in a row, but there will be a good two full weeks that I'm not going to be able to stream over the next 30 days.
[04:56.27]So, just keep that in mind.
[04:59.21]I will let you know when they're going to happen.
[05:03.01]I will try to fill in some streams.
[05:06.63]I had this idea.
[05:08.25]I don't know if it's going to work or not.
[05:09.53]I'm not sure if I'm going to do it, but I'm going to think about it.
[05:13.28]It's just pre-record a couple of streams and have them go up as if they're real.
[05:18.96]But you can't schedule upload a stream.
[05:21.12]That doesn't work.
[05:21.68]It's impossible.
[05:23.64]How am I going to do that?
[05:26.44]You have to actually broadcast something.
[05:29.87]It's not like YouTube where you could schedule a video to go live.
[05:32.69]You have to hit the broadcast button.
[05:41.40]Just upload it.
[05:43.04]I could just upload it to my Twitch, right?
[05:45.72]Technically.
[05:48.24]Turn on reruns.
[05:49.50]So wait, just stream it to nobody and then run a rerun.
[05:54.16]Okay, what if I stream it to nobody on another account and then host the account that I'm rerunning it?
[06:04.47]I don't know.
[06:06.86]I'll try to figure that out.
[06:08.00]But I thought it'd be funny if it's like, oh, hey guys, we're just sitting here playing a game.
[06:13.10]And I don't know, maybe a bunch of fucked up shit will happen during the stream that I can't do, only if it was pre-recorded.
[06:19.45]But with that being said, just be aware that this is crunch time now.
[06:24.47]Streams are going to get sporadic.
[06:26.11]In fact, you might not see me for a week at a time.
[06:29.05]So going forward, I'm going to do my best to get as many streams done as I can.
[06:33.36]I will try.
[06:34.76]So bear with me here on the move to Las Vegas, because after that... Oh, boy!
[06:40.36]Oh, boy!
[06:41.57]Turbo 2.0.
[06:42.55]That's right, Turbo 2.0.
[06:44.29]Coming up.
[06:48.91]You'll see it.
[06:50.27]But let's go.
[06:50.81]We're going to play Urban Runner.
[06:52.15]Again, this is an FMV game.
[06:54.45]See you in 40 minutes when this stream ends, because the game's not very fun.
[06:57.74]Or I could eat my words here.
[06:59.72]I hope the webcam's not on, because I don't have any clothes on.
[07:03.56]No, it's not.
[07:06.25]Okay, good.
[07:06.87]I just need to double check that.
[07:08.41]I was a little concerned there.
[07:13.83]Are those patch notes?
[07:18.43]No, this game can't run unless you run it through a virtual machine.
[07:26.25]It is impossible to get this game to run.
[07:29.49]Unless you get the emulated version.
[07:34.85]But yeah, Scum, let's take this opportunity to shout out ScumVM.
[07:39.23]It's a great fucking piece of software.
[07:42.01]Alright, so let's go.
[07:42.89]I'm gonna hit start.
[07:44.59]And let's get this puppy going.
[07:48.76]I've always been a little absent-minded.
[07:50.32]I'm not sure if I got it from my honorable forefathers or maybe there was just a bad planetary alignment the day I was born.
[07:58.22]Whatever.
[07:59.56]It's nearly cost me my life several times.
[08:02.89]That guy's got my hair, by the way.
[08:04.65]I mean, that guy traded hairs like a year and a half ago.
[08:07.51]Ah, see, that guy was in the sauna for too long.
[08:09.53]Guys, let's get some fair warning here.
[08:10.53]Never go into a sauna for more than 10 minutes.
[08:12.15]You'd instantly die.
[08:27.94]I hadn't reckoned with my absent-mindedness.
[08:30.09]I'm gonna turn it up a little.
[08:31.65]So there I was, wearing clothes that didn't fit right, on the run from a homicidal maniac.
[08:37.73]My only hope in hell?
[08:39.17]To run.
[08:40.25]Very fast.
[08:41.70]That's it?
[08:43.64]That's the opening?
[08:44.44]No, he missed.
[08:49.90]This is the game?
[08:53.61]Irvin Runner.
[08:55.16]This guy sucks.
[09:00.64]This guy just keeps burping up food and tripping.
[09:05.50]Oh, sorry.
[09:06.16]I had too many meatballs this afternoon.
[09:13.21]Shoot him.
[09:16.53]The audio is clipping into itself.
[09:19.41]Nice roll.
[09:20.23]I can do that.
[09:23.36]He didn't get him?
[09:26.86]This is hurting my eyes.
[09:30.40]He made it right behind me.
[09:45.19]I mean, at what point does throwing the gun make more sense?
[09:57.35]That was clear.
[09:57.77]That was a laser beam.
[09:59.49]Someone just shot, like, an alien gun.
[10:07.62]The sprites.
[10:08.86]The sprites coming out of the gun.
[10:12.14]You gotta give them credit, though.
[10:13.22]They didn't have CGI back then.
[10:19.56]Oh, he made it.
[10:22.76]He's gonna lock me in the dungeon.
[10:28.55]See, sound.
[10:29.23]He's out of ammo?
[10:33.26]No, he's not.
[10:34.22]You never run out of ammo as a bad guy.
[10:38.66]Oh, okay.
[10:40.28]So that was the intro.
[10:41.10]So the guy locked me in here.
[10:44.78]Why would he lock me in?
[10:46.16]Am I trying to get away from him?
[10:49.01]He just made it really easy away from me to not see him.
[10:51.17]Okay, let's see.
[10:53.32]We got to the entrance of the basement.
[10:56.42]Point and click here.
[10:57.08]We got to the far end of the basement.
[11:00.32]Let's go to the entrance of the basement.
[11:05.99]Just wait a week and you'll start.
[11:07.47]Hold on.
[11:07.83]Changing room locker.
[11:09.27]Let's put on some new clothes.
[11:12.73]There'll be a dead body in here.
[11:16.00]Well, that would be a very, very skinny dead body.
[11:17.92]Never mind.
[11:21.76]Is there a gun?
[11:27.79]interesting it's a fishing hook time to catch some big fish so somebody had a yellow big raincoat and a fishing loop now isn't that interesting that was loud okay use fishing line on locker wait what is that iPhone what year did this come out
[11:54.83]Use fishing line on stairs.
[11:56.33]Hold on, am I gonna home alone this guy?
[11:58.93]I better.
[11:59.35]I bet a Macaulay Culkin home alone bum this guy.
[12:03.78]Yep.
[12:05.04]He's gonna fall for the oldest trick in the 90s book.
[12:08.90]Trip over the fucking really easy to kick down fishing line.
[12:13.04]And he's gonna trip and he's gonna break his neck.
[12:21.48]Why is he waiting this long?
[12:26.15]Oh, he's out here looking at paintings?
[12:28.65]Alright, I really like that one.
[12:33.79]Why wouldn't he come in here?
[12:37.35]Why doesn't he come in here?
[12:41.91]Wait a minute.
[12:42.41]Are we playing hide and seek?
[12:44.41]Is he counting right now while I go hide?
[12:46.81]That would make more sense.
[12:49.47]So can I... Okay, I'm going to hide by the stairs, right?
[12:53.00]And I'm going to come out and scream like, Got ya!
[12:58.78]That should do it.
[12:59.76]Okay, no, I don't think I have the stairs.
[13:01.50]Slippery stairs.
[13:02.84]Just what I needed.
[13:03.54]Do I have to dump water on him?
[13:06.23]Alright, into the middle of the room.
[13:07.37]I think that's all I can do here.
[13:11.27]Changing room locker by the stairs.
[13:12.97]Alright, let's turn around.
[13:14.83]I just had my iPhone feed that I turned off.
[13:20.04]Alright, to the far end of the basement.
[13:21.50]Let's go.
[13:21.80]This is gonna be great.
[13:24.61]I can't wait for the fucking car crash sounds that happen when this guy come in.
[13:29.65]He's gonna open that door and you're gonna hear like a bunch of plates break and shit.
[13:37.63]Maybe not.
[13:38.63]Uh... I guess this is the only thing I can do.
[13:45.69]No?
[13:45.93]To the entrance of the basement?
[13:47.49]It's probably like a fucking...
[13:51.33]Yeah, there's one button to push.
[13:52.81]It's made out of clay.
[13:55.47]Central brick.
[13:56.41]Nothing else I can do, right?
[13:58.37]Wait, hold on.
[14:04.56]These bricks look kind of new.
[14:06.30]It's right there.
[14:08.62]It's right there.
[14:09.16]I can see it.
[14:10.06]Press it.
[14:11.84]Stop the booby trap.
[14:14.63]Yes, it sounds hollow.
[14:17.89]So kick it.
[14:24.30]Dude, put your tongue on it.
[14:25.26]Like, stick your nose in there.
[14:26.44]It sounds hollow.
[14:28.34]Yes, it sounds like a brick.
[14:33.19]Um... Hold on.
[14:34.57]He's still... He's still looking at that painting.
[14:37.31]He can't get over it.
[14:38.09]He loves it.
[14:40.99]He's been looking at that image for about 15 straight minutes.
[14:47.84]Goddamn, that artistry.
[14:49.24]Look at the line work.
[14:51.86]Um...
[14:53.76]towards the wall.
[14:56.87]Maybe I should go antagonize the guy?
[15:03.47]And I'd be like, hey, come down here, you dumb, big, stupid alien.
[15:06.97]I'm referencing to my brother.
[15:09.69]We were like 12 years old.
[15:10.95]We were at the alien ride at Disney World.
[15:13.17]The one with the guy, the alien's locked inside of the tube.
[15:16.35]And when he bursts out, everyone freaks out.
[15:19.25]And then it got really quiet when we were younger.
[15:20.79]And he was trying to sound like he was a tough kid.
[15:22.73]And that's what he yelled out when the room was quiet.
[15:24.75]And I'll never forget it.
[15:26.07]Alright.
[15:27.09]What else we got?
[15:27.63]What a great story.
[15:33.29]Okay, go up to the door.
[15:34.23]See?
[15:38.91]What if I trip on that?
[15:40.97]I can't fucking believe I'm doing it.
[15:42.25]I'm doing... What was that?
[15:43.47]You interrupted my painting viewing?
[15:47.08]How dare you?
[15:47.50]Punk.
[16:03.23]Now I'm gonna lock myself in here!
[16:11.33]Uh... I push him?
[16:15.56]What's he waiting for?
[16:17.28]He doesn't expect me to show myself, does he?
[16:21.02]Come on, do it!
[16:21.74]I always knew guys with big feet were shortchanged in the brain department.
[16:25.32]Oh, that's a good one.
[16:26.72]Pull the wire up?
[16:27.48]I hope to God he doesn't see the wire.
[16:31.75]What do you want me to do?
[16:35.53]way to do is there can I like just he's gonna turn and shoot me in the head I always knew guys with big feet were short change in the brain department oh wait hold on can I fish fish hook fish hook on okay right click is your inventory so I just I'm gonna fish hook his foot you asked for it
[17:15.68]I guarantee you.
[17:17.96]Any amount of money.
[17:19.32]I could have filmed a better sequence there.
[17:22.22]Any amount of money.
[17:22.84]Alright, now I'm gonna get his gun.
[17:29.90]Prove it?
[17:30.46]I already did.
[17:33.68]He's not dead, so just take his gun.
[17:38.09]Why would you go for the gun?
[17:42.13]That was pretty good.
[17:43.01]It's only a great haul, but it'll have to do.
[17:46.25]what am I no I want his gun why did I take the nail file I want his gun hey cool it I've already done my bed hey cool it I've already done my bed I already done my bit so you'd rather take a nail file than a gun hey cool it I've already done my bed I can't just turn this around and ice pick him in the neck why
[18:14.63]Okay, whatever.
[18:15.21]So now I got an ice pick.
[18:18.01]I'm going to ice pick the wall.
[18:19.65]He's going to get up and shoot at me.
[18:21.05]I've seen every one of these movies.
[18:23.45]But what about the door?
[18:25.91]Should I go up here?
[18:30.62]Can I take the paintings?
[18:31.78]What about the wall?
[18:34.20]Oh my god, he's actually waking up.
[18:39.46]Take his gun.
[18:43.51]If he wakes up, he's going to shoot you with the gun that's in his hand.
[18:50.49]Take his socks.
[18:52.39]No, I'm not going to take his socks.
[18:55.35]This is going to be so dumb.
[18:56.21]He's going to stand up.
[19:04.93]I can't take his socks off.
[19:10.97]Okay, here we go.
[19:12.07]Towards the wall.
[19:13.96]Jam it into the clay.
[19:16.32]Pull out some of the grout.
[19:24.48]That's a real shit job, by the way.
[19:25.90]He didn't even make that form factor.
[19:36.09]That was so oddly satisfying.
[19:38.33]Slash r slash oddly satisfying gifts.
[19:46.11]Oh, there's a way down.
[19:56.07]Am I going back up the stairs?
[19:59.50]Wait, hold on.
[20:00.40]I'm so confused.
[20:06.04]No, I went up, not down.
[20:10.17]Okay, I want to turn around and be like, Hey, stupid idiot head!
[20:13.47]Would you rather teach you, uh, get that in a cereal box?
[20:16.23]And then keep moving.
[20:16.89]Okay, well, he's coming up here.
[20:22.87]What happens if I peek my head out?
[20:23.91]Am I going to get shot in the face?
[20:31.64]How do I save the game?
[20:33.46]That's very...
[20:49.37]Oh, fuck.
[20:50.85]Okay, um, wait.
[20:52.05]I don't have any saved games.
[20:56.70]How do I save?
[21:01.56]How do I save?
[21:04.28]But how do I save a game?
[21:09.14]There is no save.
[21:10.12]Thank god I can do this.
[21:11.64]Oh, okay, I gotta go.
[21:14.95]Uh, let's go.
[21:15.37]Gonna go to the red room.
[21:22.26]I put my head in the... That was perfect.
[21:26.48]There is no save button.
[21:28.18]Oh, here he comes.
[21:28.70]To the right.
[21:30.54]And to the dump room.
[21:35.08]This is a very well-lit game, I'll tell you that.
[21:38.54]Oh, God.
[21:39.22]Flow rate counter.
[21:41.26]What the fuck is this supposed to mean?
[21:45.26]Five, three, seven, double zero, triple zero, five, three, seven.
[21:49.64]Somebody write that down.
[21:53.14]0-0-0-5-3-7.
[21:57.22]Turn the flowgate.
[21:59.18]Oh, shit.
[22:01.22]But I need numbers here.
[22:06.33]It's stuck.
[22:06.83]Okay, it's stuck.
[22:07.53]I gotta keep moving.
[22:07.99]It must be switched off.
[22:10.45]Oh, wait.
[22:11.39]No.
[22:12.71]Turn the flow floodgate.
[22:14.05]Turn the pressure floodgate to the right.
[22:17.90]This relieves the pressure, which allows me to... No, that's not going to work.
[22:24.32]It's stuck.
[22:25.90]It must be switched off.
[22:27.39]Okay, it's switched off.
[22:30.01]Is there a power button on here?
[22:33.91]Off.
[22:34.59]Okay, on-off lever.
[22:38.51]They all stuck.
[22:39.41]Nothing.
[22:40.45]The pump must be off.
[22:42.36]Okay, I got to go.
[22:45.65]Liam Neeson's long-haired brother is currently pretending to be a zombie.
[22:50.57]Keep going.
[22:52.37]I'm in the same room as him now?
[22:55.06]Alright, sneak behind him and knock him out with a karate chop.
[23:00.76]Okay.
[23:01.96]That worked, Stu.
[23:03.32]I'm right behind you, man.
[23:05.08]Uh-oh.
[23:06.35]I better be off before he decides to show up.
[23:08.69]Huh?
[23:09.35]There must be a way out of here.
[23:11.55]But I'm going to have to risk my butt to find it.
[23:13.73]Hold on, he's standing behind me.
[23:19.92]Why would he, like, is he not gonna shoot me?
[23:26.75]I'm right behind you.
[23:29.51]Uh, he's kind of just watching me.
[23:32.44]While I check every single cubbyhole at the McDonald's play place.
[23:36.10]Ah, no!
[23:37.68]Somebody took my shoes!
[23:39.86]Can't see a thing.
[23:40.68]Now I gotta go barefoot the rest of the day!
[23:42.49]Alright, um...
[23:47.72]I just backed up back into him.
[23:49.14]Okay.
[23:49.60]What about the room with the panels?
[23:54.56]Okay.
[23:55.18]He said that just to... Alright.
[23:56.80]We're going in a circle.
[23:58.98]Alright.
[24:04.55]I need... I need to find a way to turn the valve on.
[24:11.87]It's not this room.
[24:13.49]Maybe it is.
[24:15.27]What about to the right?
[24:16.07]I didn't go over here.
[24:17.97]Document Transporter?
[24:21.98]What do these buttons do?
[24:26.18]Button, button.
[24:28.76]What kind of rich motherfucker do you have with two separate doorbells?
[24:31.50]One of these plays a song, the other one plays, like, a default dumbbell.
[24:46.90]There's gotta be a sequence here.
[24:48.00]Default dumbbell.
[24:55.53]Whatever, I can't stand it.
[24:56.39]I don't know what the sequence is.
[24:58.89]What about wire?
[25:00.31]When there's a wire, there's an electrical grid.
[25:03.75]Sure, okay.
[25:04.45]So, go back.
[25:09.91]What about over here?
[25:11.81]To the pump room.
[25:13.73]To the right.
[25:16.00]Something right here?
[25:17.50]What's this?
[25:17.94]Blocked up... Blocked up door.
[25:20.66]Yeah, I'm done for too.
[25:22.63]What?
[25:22.99]Yeah, I'm done for too.
[25:24.33]What are you talking about?
[25:25.29]Cross the corridor with the cubbyholes.
[25:33.24]This guy sucks.
[25:35.06]When I catch ya...
[25:41.16]Okay.
[25:43.10]This guy, this guy.
[25:45.48]What, can I sit on the bench?
[25:47.93]Why would I do this?
[25:48.77]Whoa, it's a little shaky.
[25:55.47]Just waiting for him.
[25:57.17]Yeah, he's almost here.
[25:58.39]Waiting for my bus, hold on, I gotta... See where he is.
[26:04.10]Whoa, it's a little shaky.
[26:06.04]He's gonna deliver me to the fucking promised land.
[26:15.29]That's a little shaky.
[26:16.27]Alright, uh, let's just keep going.
[26:23.59]Nope, he missed.
[26:27.84]Alright.
[26:36.30]I have to be perceptive.
[26:37.74]Let's just... I'm just running in circles.
[26:44.91]I need to go to the pump room again.
[26:46.63]Wait, fuse box.
[26:50.03]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[26:51.35]Um... Wait, wait, wait.
[26:52.75]537, right?
[26:55.93]537.
[26:56.51]Shelves fuse.
[26:57.99]Use fuse on... Panel fuse.
[27:02.05]Hold.
[27:02.55]Dr. Trey.
[27:04.83]Uh... Pump fuse.
[27:05.69]Pump fuse.
[27:06.09]Put him in the pump.
[27:07.92]Alright.
[27:10.86]Go, go, go, go.
[27:11.48]That's the pump.
[27:12.96]That's the pump.
[27:21.65]Alright, turn the pump on.
[27:22.41]That's gotta be it, right?
[27:24.63]Yeah!
[27:25.09]Alright, now release the gas.
[27:29.15]The pump's not working, but I turned it on.
[27:31.63]What the fuck?
[27:32.43]Okay.
[27:32.63]Maybe the flow and pressure need adjusting.
[27:34.35]Okay, turn the, let's turn the flow, turn the pressure.
[27:37.81]I don't know what this is gonna do, but.
[27:42.78]It's gonna increase the pressure in the room.
[27:47.90]We're gonna lose oxygen here in about 10 seconds.
[27:51.55]Okay, and then turn the flow, turn the flow gate.
[27:58.41]This better not blow up in my face.
[28:02.19]What the fuck does that even do?
[28:07.00]Flow rate counter.
[28:08.08]Alright, 5-5-0.
[28:09.34]What do I have to get this to?
[28:12.00]Oh, shit.
[28:12.58]Okay, gotta go.
[28:21.27]Do I have to get into all zero?
[28:22.35]I am gonna get you.
[28:27.14]I don't think he is.
[28:28.50]Bench.
[28:29.64]Wedge.
[28:34.06]What is in there?
[28:34.62]Oh, there'd be directions.
[28:37.20]Somebody hid the pump directions.
[28:43.05]Right?
[28:45.89]Stand up and tell me what it is.
[28:46.73]Stop.
[28:47.07]Go.
[28:47.97]Now all I need is to find the book this page is from.
[28:53.34]I don't know where that is.
[28:58.40]I need to find a book?
[29:02.82]There's no book in the cubbyhole, right?
[29:11.11]Turn the one to book the right way up.
[29:16.45]Document Transporter.
[29:18.36]I have to get... The Document Transporter has the book inside.
[29:22.99]That's certain, right?
[29:24.39]So I need to get into this thing.
[29:29.97]Of course, the book would be in the document.
[29:36.16]But, how do I get this to open?
[29:37.54]Is it not powered?
[29:40.50]I just keep running around until he's out of bullets.
[29:51.23]So maybe I have to go to the fuse box What else we got here we got document transporter fuse holder wall panel Give me the pump give me the pump fuse put it in the document fuse Alright now I gotta run around a circle again out out out go out go go go go go go
[30:17.68]Wrong fuse?
[30:18.40]No, I just smoked the docket.
[30:19.72]I'll take it out.
[30:23.03]This thing doesn't have power.
[30:23.99]I better not... He's not here, right?
[30:39.21]This guy is seriously so bad at this.
[30:42.53]I'm so glad that I can't die.
[30:44.19]I don't think it's possible.
[30:52.94]Implying you can get hit.
[30:54.88]There's no need to run.
[30:56.56]I'll get you anyway.
[30:57.74]Yeah, but that's because I looked down.
[30:59.98]Okay, document transporter.
[31:01.22]Let's see if this thing works.
[31:05.30]This is very clearly a circle.
[31:06.46]If you just sprinted in a circle.
[31:07.58]Alright.
[31:08.00]Transporter, open it up.
[31:10.14]Aha.
[31:10.98]Just needed a fuse to turn the lights on.
[31:12.80]Yes.
[31:13.88]Button.
[31:14.76]Power.
[31:15.30]Open.
[31:17.22]Really?
[31:23.46]You... What the fuck are you talking about?
[31:34.16]Green light, red light.
[31:35.22]Go back.
[31:43.11]Go back.
[31:51.66]Wall panel fuse holder.
[31:54.32]Wall panel.
[31:55.58]If there's only one fuse for all these boxes, this is going to be tricky.
[32:00.96]Okay, document.
[32:02.44]So put it in the wall panel.
[32:05.23]Because this is the shelves fuse?
[32:08.81]Hold on, wait, the shelves have power?
[32:11.09]Go back, I want to see this.
[32:22.36]How does that make any sense?
[32:23.10]See, now he's not even attempting to shoot me anymore.
[32:31.86]Okay.
[32:34.64]That's what dying sounds.
[32:35.70]Alright, cubby holes.
[32:41.17]Shelves.
[32:42.31]I put power in here.
[32:43.13]Come on, where's the power?
[32:47.03]I just powered all the shelves, where is it?
[32:50.48]Come on, where's the powered cells?
[32:52.14]Nothing.
[32:58.46]Can't see a thing in here.
[33:04.30]There's nothing in here.
[33:05.18]I was reaching and feeling this.
[33:06.86]Why would this matter?
[33:07.98]Oh wow, please.
[33:11.40]Another fucking Friday's menu.
[33:20.30]Well, well.
[33:21.64]Looks like the plan to the place.
[33:22.98]What?
[33:29.36]What the hell is this thing?
[33:30.82]Management?
[33:31.30]Inventory?
[33:32.32]Memory?
[33:34.16]Plan of the site.
[33:37.28]So you're here.
[33:39.40]So there's the map.
[33:42.78]Management?
[33:44.10]Oh, thank god.
[33:46.80]Labyrinth, that's fine.
[33:49.53]This is your inventory.
[33:50.47]Okay.
[33:51.19]I'm at 10% completion, guys.
[33:52.61]I'm almost at the fucking end of the game.
[33:53.87]Alright.
[33:57.40]Turn that off.
[33:58.46]I got what I needed from there.
[34:01.34]Now we have to go get the fuse.
[34:06.44]It's a new emote on the map.
[34:09.95]Hold on, what?
[34:13.53]The emote.
[34:16.27]I want to see the emote.
[34:20.44]That's not a fucking emote.
[34:22.46]Wait, can I move myself?
[34:26.42]No.
[34:26.76]Alright, so I gotta go back to the fuse box.
[34:30.26]So the next step here would be... There's only one fuse.
[34:37.09]So take the shelves fuse.
[34:39.93]And we've got shelves fuse.
[34:42.09]Panel fuse hold.
[34:47.03]Dock...
[34:48.73]True fuse hold.
[34:50.55]And then pump.
[34:51.26]Panel fuse hold.
[34:52.14]Get it in there.
[34:52.68]Open it up.
[34:55.86]Alright.
[34:56.20]Back it up.
[34:57.60]Back.
[34:57.98]We have to go around the circuit.
[35:04.70]So I have to open this and then go put it in.
[35:07.91]The other one.
[35:11.75]Don't shoot me.
[35:14.15]This guy hasn't moved from this room.
[35:17.74]Stop running, you bastard.
[35:19.12]Just turn around.
[35:20.38]If I turn around, he might walk right into me.
[35:29.13]There's no amount of... You can't fucking... You can't fucking... You've broken my leg, you bastard.
[35:37.19]We're both locked in here.
[35:38.71]There's no cell phones.
[35:41.03]This guy sucks.
[35:44.34]Alright, let's open this.
[35:46.26]Open it.
[35:48.88]Come on dude, I powered it!
[35:49.98]I powered the panel!
[35:53.92]What panel is it talking about then?
[35:55.43]I didn't power the panel to open the panel?
[35:57.61]The wall panel?
[35:58.95]What panel?
[36:08.61]What panel are they referring to?
[36:09.77]Yeah, I'm done for too.
[36:13.59]The panel.
[36:14.23]The panel.
[36:16.90]Oh, fuck.
[36:19.98]Check the map for the signs of a panel.
[36:30.10]The room with the panel.
[36:31.77]The one that's the only one that said panel.
[36:35.27]Hold on.
[36:37.19]I need to go into my memory and find the panel.
[36:39.97]Alright, where's the panel?
[36:42.92]There's the cubbies.
[36:44.34]Look for a panel.
[36:49.60]Right there?
[37:00.71]Oh, I think... Panel.
[37:02.97]That's a panel, right?
[37:03.81]No, what am I doing?
[37:11.34]Use the way out.
[37:15.52]I've got to empty the water from this tank, though.
[37:20.20]Fuck.
[37:21.10]No, no.
[37:23.52]Water tank.
[37:24.28]I can't.
[37:25.60]I... Go to the blue room?
[37:36.93]Oh, shit!
[37:39.95]I made it.
[37:41.53]When I catch you,
[37:44.04]Turn on the water.
[37:44.93]Hold on.
[37:45.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[37:47.41]I gotta find... Where's the blue room?
[37:49.53]I'm in the blue room.
[37:50.19]Where's the panel?
[37:53.35]Turn to the left.
[37:59.11]Panel!
[38:00.13]On wall.
[38:03.38]Oh, God.
[38:03.72]There's too many things here.
[38:04.50]That's like an entire... There's an entire periodic table here.
[38:09.06]Oh, shit.
[38:09.94]Poster?
[38:10.54]It's the signal for this damn lift.
[38:15.01]It's the signal for this damn lift.
[38:16.47]So we got one, two, green, green... Okay, memorize this.
[38:20.97]It's the signal for this damn lift.
[38:23.34]Memorize that.
[38:24.46]Somebody memorize it.
[38:25.40]I won't.
[38:26.16]Red, red, green, red, green, red, red, green.
[38:30.28]Somebody memorize that.
[38:36.22]Alright, back out here.
[38:37.22]So how do I get this fucking thing open?
[38:43.29]How do I open this?
[38:46.69]Because this thing has no power, but I can't get it open.
[38:54.64]This is the code for this.
[38:58.90]What?
[39:02.92]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[39:05.58]Yes, you're right.
[39:06.36]Yes, it is.
[39:07.03]Yes, it is.
[39:07.55]Yes, it is.
[39:08.09]You got it.
[39:08.59]You got it.
[39:09.05]Mike George, you've got it.
[39:11.19]Alright.
[39:12.51]Alright, yeah.
[39:16.99]So, it's for that box.
[39:18.71]I gotta move around, I gotta run around in a circle.
[39:26.58]This game is sick.
[39:30.08]Alright, now... Did you guys memorize it already?
[39:37.36]There's no need to run.
[39:39.07]I'll get you anyway.
[39:40.51]You don't have to always run in a circle, but I have to because I'm terrified to not.
[39:46.50]This guy hasn't figured it out yet that he can just turn around and catch me the other side.
[39:50.20]This guy's a dog.
[39:52.76]You ever play the run around in a circle in your house with a dog?
[39:56.26]They will never try to cut you off.
[39:58.44]They'll always go the same way.
[40:03.36]Alright, so I see we got some emotes here helping me out.
[40:05.78]The yay and the nay.
[40:06.78]So what was it?
[40:08.42]It was green.
[40:09.18]What was the green?
[40:09.76]What?
[40:10.08]Green red?
[40:11.53]Oh no, people are doing this.
[40:15.49]People are fucking this up on purpose.
[40:16.93]Oh fuck.
[40:17.33]I did it.
[40:41.55]I did it.
[40:44.71]Give me the fucking book.
[40:49.73]So hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[40:51.41]This looks interesting.
[40:53.91]Use manual.
[40:56.25]Go back, go back, go back, hold on.
[40:57.99]So that's it?
[40:59.55]So should I use the pages on the manual, open the manual, look at the manual?
[41:02.31]Let me take a look.
[41:09.53]So, manual.
[41:12.06]Can I look at manual?
[41:13.42]Torn out page.
[41:14.36]Use the torn out page on the manual.
[41:17.36]Use manual on the pump.
[41:21.94]Look at manual.
[41:24.19]3D magnification.
[41:25.03]576.
[41:26.05]Alright, 576 is what we're looking for.
[41:44.02]torn out page.
[41:45.56]Uh-oh.
[41:46.26]That thing looks tricky to me.
[41:47.74]What?
[41:49.90]When both figures are correctly set, activate the on-off lever.
[41:54.12]Turn the pressure floodgate until it reads 2.
[42:00.36]Turn clockwise to increase pressure and anti-clockwise to reduce pressure.
[42:04.82]Okay.
[42:06.42]Check the flow rate counter's position.
[42:08.14]This is too much for me!
[42:12.00]Hold on.
[42:13.74]Check the manometer's position.
[42:16.38]Turn on the pressure until it reads 2.
[42:20.89]Turn clockwise to increase.
[42:23.75]Counterclockwise.
[42:24.91]I've got to get out of the room.
[42:42.89]I can't take it.
[42:44.77]I can't take it.
[42:45.47]Okay.
[42:52.67]Alright, okay.
[42:54.37]I just gotta get... I gotta pull the panel.
[42:58.61]Get this thing out.
[43:00.49]The pressure needs to be two.
[43:03.33]This is not two, this is one.
[43:10.65]Pump fuse.
[43:11.53]Let's try this.
[43:12.19]Let's go into the pump room.
[43:18.12]That was a very funny epic gamer moment.
[43:23.76]And I turn around in the pump room.
[43:25.20]I mean, I can try.
[43:28.98]To the left.
[43:31.26]What the fuck is this?
[43:32.16]No, that's just a way to sneak out.
[43:35.72]Alright, so I want to take a look at this.
[43:38.34]Where's the, uh...
[43:41.74]I need to see the counter.
[43:43.78]Low ray counter.
[43:44.16]Alright, this is, it needs to be, uh, five, seven, six, right?
[43:49.43]Five, seven, six.
[43:55.61]Turn pressure, we're gonna turn pressure to the right.
[44:00.35]This needs to get to two.
[44:01.19]That's it, right?
[44:07.48]Okay.
[44:09.80]Okay.
[44:11.27]Take a look at that flow rate.
[44:12.77]Okay, turn to the right.
[44:18.01]I gotta sneak out of here.
[44:21.81]What's it look like?
[44:24.58]563, almost there.
[44:26.16]Hold on, I gotta get out of here though.
[44:27.24]I gotta sneak out.
[44:38.80]My mic is too quiet?
[44:40.20]It shouldn't be.
[44:43.26]You should be able to hear me.
[44:48.53]There's no need to keep moving.
[44:51.03]Well, isn't he gonna... Well, if I go back in this room, he's gonna shoot me in the fucking head.
[44:59.03]I'm gonna save.
[45:03.40]Save it.
[45:12.09]So you're telling me I don't have to freak out and run around?
[45:14.77]Alright, I think this is going to do it.
[45:21.52]What does this actually do, though?
[45:25.28]Okay, 576.
[45:25.94]Got it.
[45:26.54]Now what?
[45:30.06]Start the pump.
[45:36.95]Thank you.
[45:37.81]But I turned the damn pump on.
[45:40.07]Maybe the pressure and flow need adjusting.
[45:43.03]Somebody pass me the instruction manual.
[45:44.77]I just powered it.
[45:46.45]Hold on a minute.
[45:48.33]Manual.
[45:49.17]576.
[45:49.25]Is that 576?
[45:49.61]Another pressure?
[45:50.10]Should be.
[45:53.94]Reduce the pressure.
[46:11.57]Alright, let's reduce the pressure.
[46:14.43]Try to turn it off.
[46:23.67]Use the torn page on the manual.
[46:25.55]I don't think I can.
[46:26.07]Alright, start it up.
[46:28.68]Come on, I gotta mow my lawn.
[46:33.08]Nothing?
[46:34.12]Nothing.
[46:35.08]But I turned the damn pump off.
[46:37.36]Maybe the pressure and flow need adjusting.
[46:40.30]Somebody pass me the instruction manual.
[46:43.27]Do I need to do this again?
[46:44.21]Consume the manual.
[46:51.13]Did I power the pump?
[46:52.08]Yeah, it's got power.
[46:52.82]Maybe this is just still too high.
[47:05.98]Yeah, we already looked at the torn out page.
[47:07.34]Nothing.
[47:08.29]But I turned the damn pump on.
[47:10.57]Maybe the pressure and flow need adjusting.
[47:13.53]Somebody pass me the instruction manual.
[47:15.23]You have to say that every time.
[47:16.37]Alright, inventory.
[47:18.29]Torn out page.
[47:20.46]Let's see.
[47:22.24]Okay, yeah, switch on the pump.
[47:24.22]Electrical source.
[47:24.98]Check the manometer's position.
[47:28.10]Turn the pressure... What do you mean?
[47:29.46]Where's the manometer?
[47:31.44]Turn the pressure floodgate until it reads two.
[47:34.78]Turn clockwise to reduce bread.
[47:36.40]Check the flow rate counter's position.
[47:37.90]It is.
[47:38.18]Turn the flow rate to set the counter to the amount indicated on the figure opposite.
[47:42.70]Turn clockwise to increase the flow when both figures are correct.
[47:45.22]So where's the manometer?
[47:46.14]I don't see a manometer.
[47:52.93]Flow rate counter.
[47:55.11]Pressure.
[47:56.63]Manometer.
[47:59.25]Oops.
[47:59.55]No, I'm fine.
[48:09.65]It's the gauge.
[48:11.53]I'm just going in a circle again.
[48:15.71]Dude, I'm paranoid that he's gonna come in that room.
[48:24.89]I swear to God.
[48:29.37]I'm doing this just because to help myself.
[48:33.94]Okay, pump room.
[48:37.79]So is the pressure gauge the one on the left?
[48:39.55]Because I don't see a pressure meter.
[48:45.67]I'm going to slowly go over this.
[48:48.93]The flow rate counter, right?
[48:50.21]So you get 576.
[48:52.31]The thing on the left?
[48:53.18]Is this the pressure?
[48:54.48]No.
[49:03.04]My frog was pointing down.
[49:04.08]Okay, where's the manometer?
[49:06.70]It says...
[49:09.95]The manual says where the manometer is.
[49:11.71]Alright, C, D, B, A, A, E. Okay, E, A, B. Those are the two valves, and then you got this.
[49:25.78]What's D?
[49:29.74]D, it's like over here.
[49:30.88]That's the flow rate counter.
[49:37.83]A, D, B, B, C. Manometer!
[49:42.29]It's at four.
[49:42.77]Alright, bring it down.
[49:45.39]Turn it to the left.
[49:47.23]Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
[49:49.74]Is that enough?
[49:58.94]We need to do another one.
[50:01.71]Three, another one.
[50:03.71]Oh no, he's gonna... Stop running, you bastard!
[50:06.60]I gotta get out of this room now, go.
[50:24.23]I already know what to fucking- I already know what to do.
[50:31.41]Shit's in here, right?
[50:36.60]Did I already power this thing?
[50:40.00]Yeah, it's already in there.
[50:42.91]Power's in the pump.
[50:45.21]I know what I'm doing now.
[50:50.89]He actually can get you.
[50:52.18]Yeah, yeah.
[50:53.46]I thought it was just for fun.
[50:55.80]Okay, so now we need to do this again.
[50:57.18]576.
[50:57.20]Turn it once.
[51:00.10]To the right.
[51:01.38]To increase pressure.
[51:04.93]Manometer down to two, pull the lever, and get the fuck out of here, you know what I'm saying?
[51:10.21]Manometer's at six, so we gotta go left.
[51:15.30]Shitload of time.
[51:21.62]What it really came down to was knowing where the manometer was.
[51:23.92]You can't even see it.
[51:24.70]Like a smudged thing over here on the wall.
[51:27.80]Do you increase the pressure?
[51:31.70]No, I don't.
[51:32.06]It'll be fine.
[51:38.74]Tribute 576, right?
[51:39.46]What is this game?
[51:41.46]The game is called Urban Runner.
[51:43.62]576.
[51:43.70]Making sure that's correct.
[51:46.48]One more time and then I'm going to have to run away.
[51:50.04]Tribute 3.
[51:56.78]Yeah, I'm not doing very much running.
[52:00.50]That's true.
[52:00.84]Alright, where's he going?
[52:05.41]He's not over here yet.
[52:08.13]That should be it.
[52:11.45]Start it.
[52:12.13]I don't know what it's going to do, but I'm going to run.
[52:14.43]Hopefully.
[52:20.34]Start it.
[52:23.40]Sweet music to my ears.
[52:25.36]The water must be emptying next door.
[52:29.03]Alright.
[52:29.31]Where is he, though?
[52:29.93]I don't want to run into him.
[52:35.18]Last time I ran into him, he was out here.
[52:38.06]Alright, hold on.
[52:38.56]He's like right here, right?
[52:40.88]Red, blue.
[52:41.86]He's in the yellow room.
[52:43.50]I'm going to go to the green room.
[52:45.64]Save it right here.
[52:49.94]Do it.
[52:50.28]What are you doing?
[52:50.88]God damn, I'm stupid.
[52:53.76]Okay, save.
[52:54.36]Through here.
[53:00.30]Now we've got to go to the room with the water, which is the blue room, which is... Where are we now?
[53:07.41]So I've got to go behind me into the... Well, actually, we can go yellow and then blue.
[53:13.75]He's right here, though, isn't he?
[53:16.90]You're a smart cookie.
[53:18.80]Hey, thanks.
[53:28.28]hand now from here we are I just don't want to run into him this is the blue show it's in the yeah it's right here that's not what where's the water pump was the whole point of me just to get out of here it's in the shelf right now I was like wait what he's coming down this way
[54:00.73]Head turn.
[54:03.01]Okay, there it is.
[54:04.85]Goodbye.
[54:06.93]You broken my leg, you bastard.
[54:09.93]Don't worry, guys.
[54:11.05]We finally got out of here.
[54:12.46]We're going to jump down the well.
[54:15.70]I kind of wish you could just get in there and take a bath.
[54:27.97]Daylight at last.
[54:29.67]I took a deep breath of fresh air, already imagining myself sprawled out on my comfy sofa, holding a glass of my best whiskey in my hand.
[54:37.25]Look, he's running.
[54:38.81]Very shitily, by the way.
[54:42.19]That's not how you run away from somebody.
[54:46.86]And yet I had to face the facts.
[54:48.90]As soon as they found my papers at the sauna, all the cops in Europe would be breathing down my neck.
[54:53.74]I couldn't read it, though, because it was just chicken scratch from a four-year-old.
[55:01.82]My niece was playing with crayons again, and I pretended it was my license.
[55:08.42]I got the spare key from the housekeeper, and finally made it to my place to pick up the film.
[55:15.51]That roll of film was the only proof I had of Marcos' crimes.
[55:18.63]I didn't do it!
[55:20.87]Button your shirt up, you've had plenty of time.
[55:23.67]Now he's just showing off.
[55:25.01]Who the fuck?
[55:28.71]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone?
[55:34.49]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone playing on my piano?
[56:01.92]You slowly reach over.
[56:06.96]Oh, hold on, man.
[56:08.60]Don't shoot.
[56:09.96]It's really important.
[56:10.88]You reach over and play one key on your piano.
[56:14.46]And he's like, alright, man.
[56:15.26]Don't fucking do that shit.
[56:16.34]He holds the gun up.
[56:17.54]You're like, wait, wait.
[56:18.20]Don't do that.
[56:20.74]Let me do it again.
[56:22.77]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone?
[56:25.93]Eating my pizza.
[56:26.85]Talking to my girlfriend.
[56:27.99]Alright.
[56:28.47]Cuddle toy.
[56:28.87]Little fluffy bunny versus big bad wrestler.
[56:31.69]Who would you put your money on?
[56:33.95]Piano.
[56:35.09]Ball.
[56:36.47]Frost.
[56:38.33]Ball of paper.
[56:39.77]Halogen flashlight.
[56:40.75]I'm going to shine it.
[56:41.55]Wait, hold on.
[56:41.95]Ball.
[56:52.78]I'm sorry.
[57:05.88]I'm sorry I had to do it again.
[57:07.74]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone?
[57:09.14]Who's that guy sitting on my phone pizza eating my phone?
[57:12.93]Valorant flashlight.
[57:15.07]Wait, yeah.
[57:16.19]Nah.
[57:16.71]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[57:19.37]Piano.
[57:24.05]Ah, boom!
[57:26.06]It worked!
[57:27.60]It worked, I got him!
[57:31.70]What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
[57:33.82]Take his shoes off.
[57:52.66]Why did I try to take off his shirt?
[57:55.00]My pizza, eating my piano.
[57:58.74]Flashlight.
[57:59.91]Oh, fuck.
[58:01.69]Ball.
[58:06.50]Alright, now drag him into the yellow rope.
[58:17.91]That guy's sitting on my sofa using my phone.
[58:21.93]I want to see that again.
[58:23.92]Look at this shit.
[58:24.86]He goes point blank.
[58:28.38]Jesus Christ, what is my guy doing?
[58:30.90]Why am I wrestling his shoe off?
[58:33.29]Just watch this.
[58:34.95]Like, what am I trying to do?
[58:40.72]There's no reason to do any of that.
[58:44.38]I'm not trying to drag him.
[58:45.64]I'm just wrestling his shin.
[58:50.28]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone?
[58:52.95]Alright, halogen flashlight.
[58:55.39]Alright, cuddly toy.
[59:00.85]Use cuddly toy on killer.
[59:09.02]Who's that guy sitting on my sofa using my phone?
[59:12.52]He's calling his buddies and telling them he's found my phone.
[59:17.48]Hold on, wait.
[59:18.38]Is there anything else we can do with this?
[59:20.50]Can I do something with the piano?
[59:23.00]You're telling me I can't, like, fucking throw the piano at him?
[59:25.40]Please.
[59:26.74]I better do something.
[59:28.18]Fast.
[59:29.74]Use the cuddle toy on piano.
[59:33.10]No.
[59:34.38]Use the cuddle toy on ball.
[59:37.54]No.
[59:38.78]Use cuddle toy on piano.
[59:42.58]Kick ball in face.
[59:45.38]Alright, now put- throw piano on.
[59:47.28]Throw piano on guy.
[59:50.62]Legs, revolver, what else can I do?
[59:54.30]Legs.
[59:55.72]Fucking point blank shot, man.
[59:57.84]I just take the revolver out of his hands.
[60:00.64]That's my film.
[60:05.59]What?
[60:07.43]that's my thumb at last the punk decided to leave me what was mine this film would prove once and for all that lagrange the unscrupulous politician and marcos the drug wait what just happened my brave guy act must have impressed old fatso because he literally vanished into thin air
[60:27.58]He left a clue behind, though, which would lead me to him later.
[60:30.84]A book of matches he must have dropped during our scuffle.
[60:34.66]He still doesn't have his shirt closed.
[60:37.93]This guy has been like this for, like, four or five hours.
[60:40.71]There were some odds and ends in Tony Markle's pockets.
[60:42.97]No, go to sleep in the clothes.
[60:44.81]A key.
[60:47.40]An electronic diary.
[60:49.75]and other stuff that would help me with my investigation.
[60:52.09]I keep fucking thinking about it.
[60:58.85]It's like being level 4 going up against like a level 30 boss.
[61:02.13]I called my buddy Dee Dee, the computer wiz.
[61:04.63]This genius knows everything there is to know about everybody.
[61:07.97]I was sure he'd be able to make sense of my discoveries.
[61:10.88]I told him about my adventure at the sauna and the chase with Buffalo Bill.
[61:15.00]He suggested I tell him the rest in person.
[61:17.46]He never can tell who might be eavesdropping.
[61:20.86]Rub me over.
[61:21.22]This camera sucks.
[61:37.41]I crossed town and went into Dee Dee's dump.
[61:39.89]Unluckily for me, three tough guys were all prepared for the eviction officer to arrive.
[61:44.53]And through one hell of a mix-up, they thought it was me.
[61:47.31]No, it's not me.
[61:49.17]Come on, Betty, let's kick the crap out of him.
[61:51.09]Now I have to run around in a circle again and avoid people.
[61:54.35]Oh, hell, there's no way out of here.
[61:55.51]I've got to hide.
[61:57.97]Fuck.
[61:58.37]Into the ladies' room.
[62:00.57]Go into the bathroom.
[62:01.39]Alright, into the bathroom.
[62:02.91]Go.
[62:03.01]Uh, I...
[62:27.96]I told you this is hide and seek.
[62:34.03]Oh, no, they're both grabbing me!
[62:39.77]Okay, hiding place.
[62:41.29]Door to the ladies' room.
[62:42.01]I'm gonna open it, and then I'm not gonna go in.
[62:44.39]Okay, now... That's literally the only... I can't do anything else.
[62:54.40]I know I just did that, but there's nothing else for me to do.
[62:56.30]I can't go anywhere.
[63:02.47]She's gonna go in the ladies room, right?
[63:10.30]No.
[63:16.64]That guy has, like, a two and a half foot long rat tail, by the way.
[63:21.20]Is that what that is, or is that a braid?
[63:22.62]I can't even tell.
[63:24.59]I know I did the same thing twice, but what?
[63:27.13]Turn off the lights?
[63:31.05]Switch turned on.
[63:36.17]I don't know what that does.
[63:38.20]I've had it if I go in there.
[63:41.02]Switch turned off.
[63:45.08]Switch turned on.
[63:56.48]Okay.
[64:00.05]Yes, I heard... Hide.
[64:09.05]Leave the hiding place.
[64:12.81]Yeah, so then she's gonna go into the... Yeah, see?
[64:20.20]Okay, so now she'll be like, oh, he went in here because the tree turned on the lights.
[64:25.27]Alright, now get out of here.
[64:27.05]Leave the hiding place.
[64:30.47]Go in here and give her a swirling.
[64:33.47]All I need to do now is shut her in.
[64:36.37]Shutting her in won't get her off my back.
[64:38.44]What?
[64:38.72]That's what I just said I had to do.
[64:40.50]That's what I just said I had to do.
[64:42.20]He just told me to do that.
[64:43.42]Plank.
[64:46.62]That won't do much damage.
[64:47.86]What do you mean it won't do much damage?
[64:51.12]Hit her right in the fucking head.
[64:52.34]One down.
[64:53.26]Now for the next one.
[64:56.02]Okay, can.
[64:56.26]Save it.
[64:56.44]I have a lot of random shit.
[64:57.14]Okay, hold on.
[64:58.08]Save.
[64:58.24]Save it.
[64:58.50]Okay, here he comes, here he comes.
[64:59.43]Um, um, um, can.
[65:00.67]Use oil on switch.
[65:21.13]Use oil on, um, on cable.
[65:24.37]Use oil on, use cable, electric cable.
[65:27.19]This electrical cable looks suspect.
[65:30.38]Uh, book of matches on oil.
[65:33.84]Oh, fuck.
[65:34.76]Pull, pull the cable.
[65:35.54]Pull cable.
[65:37.04]Zap him.
[65:52.03]Alright, let's be fair to me here.
[65:55.11]You gotta be really fair to me.
[65:57.61]I pulled it off, and then I turned it on myself, and stuck it into my own chest.
[66:03.33]So, that was a pretty good weapon, potentially.
[66:08.97]Alright, can of oil.
[66:13.75]Give me the can.
[66:15.35]So we got switch unit.
[66:17.45]I wonder if this switch still works.
[66:20.06]Turned off.
[66:21.66]What does that do?
[66:24.26]Okay.
[66:25.51]I just turned it on, or whatever I did.
[66:28.53]Oh, that... Hold the cable.
[66:30.19]Grab cable.
[66:32.25]There's no more electricity on it.
[66:36.12]Okay.
[66:36.54]Now... Uh... Can.
[66:41.24]On cable.
[66:42.08]No.
[66:42.92]Um... Can on floor.
[66:45.44]Oil on floor.
[66:48.03]Okay.
[66:49.01]Uh, now, uh, matches.
[66:51.27]Matches on oil.
[66:53.63]What?
[66:54.05]Why?
[66:54.73]Electric cable on... Turn the switch on.
[67:06.14]Okay.
[67:06.96]Now, book of matches on cable.
[67:12.24]What?
[67:12.40]What?
[67:17.70]I don't know what happened.
[67:18.40]I don't know what that, why that happened.
[67:20.72]Hey, Max.
[67:21.82]Didi welcomed me in his normal cheery way and confirmed what I thought.
[67:25.77]The electronic diary was full of coded information.
[67:27.59]That's a calculator.
[67:28.93]But it would take some time to decode.
[67:31.09]That's a calculator.
[67:32.27]The key, on the other hand, came from one of the Buena Vista chain hotels.
[67:36.15]Who am I looking at?
[67:38.03]The third thug from the dump had taken his revenge by ratting me out to the police, who were already after me since they'd found my ID papers at the sauna.
[67:49.89]Inspector Van Dale sent his men racing after me as if his life depended on it.
[67:54.17]And soon all the sirens in town were coming down the street right at me.
[67:57.47]Why would you grab a live electrical wire?
[67:59.99]Even the stranger who'd been shouting me right from the start suddenly dropped off the face of the planet.
[68:04.70]He's gonna hit me with the door?
[68:06.60]I had to find a way out of the neighborhood which now, thanks to the cops, was completely surrounded.
[68:13.34]Vandal must have received the strictest instructions to find the killer fast.
[68:17.64]And someone somewhere had clearly decided to make me the fall guy.
[68:22.64]That was pretty smooth, that little jump.
[68:23.96]They obviously hadn't reckoned on dealing with Max Gardner, Houdini II.
[68:28.61]I shook that bunch of Boy Scouts off my trail as easy as if I were playing hide-and-seek at summer camp.
[68:33.49]I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[68:36.73]I don't have a single... I don't know who this is.
[68:42.50]That's the inspector that's coming to get me.
[68:44.62]Why was that significant?
[68:50.24]I was beginning to feel like I was the hunter and the hunted.
[68:53.55]Right now I held the clue to Marcos' hideout in my very hand.
[68:57.09]The key to room 227 of the Buena Vista Hotel.
[69:02.31]Why am I dressed like this?
[69:03.45]Sorry.
[69:03.69]Register.
[69:07.26]Register.
[69:09.51]Looks like regular trash can.
[69:10.65]Looks like regular trash can.
[69:13.82]Alright, uh, book of matches.
[69:14.88]On the trash.
[69:15.94]This is some trash fight.
[69:18.42]Alright, customer one.
[69:20.96]Her name is Clarice.
[69:21.92]I was pretty sure that the man had angel face when he released the little phone.
[69:31.55]What?
[69:34.49]Uh, hold on.
[69:34.87]So they didn't do any dialog.
[69:36.97]They...
[69:39.43]I need to turn the sound down.
[69:45.58]The music is way too loud.
[69:48.38]I gotta save the game and then come back.
[69:52.02]I can't fucking hear this shit.
[69:55.44]I need management.
[70:00.82]Save the game.
[70:04.04]Like I can hear him.
[70:11.37]Be careful if you skip some... Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[70:13.84]What do you mean?
[70:14.32]What are you talking about?
[70:16.98]Music off.
[70:20.22]Look at that.
[70:21.16]Don't even need to exit the game.
[70:22.78]How can I unmask her?
[70:25.10]What?
[70:25.78]The lady's wearing a mask?
[70:28.33]She's not sure whether to trust me or not.
[70:31.09]How can I get her to make up her mind?
[70:37.29]What do you guys want to watch?
[70:41.21]Police.
[70:43.01]My fake police ID appears to have made an impression.
[70:46.97]There we go.
[70:47.61]See?
[70:48.21]How can I unmask her?
[70:51.71]Turn escape off.
[70:56.44]What about the police ID on her?
[70:57.90]The young lady told me that the girl in the next chair had stolen my key.
[71:06.62]I don't... Okay.
[71:07.74]Photo.
[71:08.10]So you just took...
[71:11.67]After all the accusations, I questioned my little thieving friend.
[71:14.57]She denied everything, of course.
[71:17.41]Told me the hotel was completely filled.
[71:19.49]What the fuck is going on?
[71:22.07]I wish I could get a look at that register.
[71:24.59]She stole my key?
[71:26.95]I kept trying to get the little wretch to admit she was lying, but she wouldn't.
[71:32.05]Alright, throw the matches under her hair.
[71:35.77]Alright, book of matches.
[71:40.68]I'm the police, goddammit.
[71:41.68]My fake ID was working wonders.
[71:43.84]The little thief sheepishly agreed to give me back my key.
[71:50.99]Alright, key 227.
[71:52.85]We lost the other person.
[71:54.47]I was pretending that I was a spy and that she would have the honor of helping me.
[72:01.23]What's the point?
[72:02.56]I can hardly tell her I already have the key to someone else's room.
[72:06.80]Looks like regular trash cans. 227.
[72:11.28]I think I can turn the music back on.
[72:13.02]Is it safe to turn on the music?
[72:17.64]Yes, it is.
[72:18.78]Okay.
[72:19.30]Room 227.
[72:19.84]Room 225.
[72:20.58]Any other objects?
[72:23.70]Earring.
[72:24.54]Take that.
[72:27.28]Put it away for safety.
[72:33.33]It's next room, 227.
[72:34.11]I can't hear anything.
[72:41.03]Yeah, neither can I. I can't hear anything either.
[72:50.18]Wait, cleaning?
[72:50.92]The cleaning lady?
[72:52.96]Hold on.
[72:53.30]Police.
[72:54.66]That's not going to work.
[72:58.05]Watch.
[72:58.63]We're talking matches.
[73:02.21]Earring.
[73:03.89]Okay, go in the room.
[73:11.53]How are you gonna get this music off?
[73:14.38]Go into the room!
[73:15.26]Perfume lingered in the room that Marcos had the key to.
[73:23.32]I can't fucking turn it off.
[73:24.98]Oh god.
[73:26.92]What's in here?
[73:28.32]Say that again.
[73:33.81]Perfume lingered in the room that Marcos had the key to.
[73:38.41]So... Stay in there for a second.
[73:41.68]I can't hear anything.
[73:43.46]Stay in the room for a second.
[73:44.95]Why are you leaving the room?
[73:47.69]The room next door was empty.
[73:49.41]It had simply been reserved by phone.
[73:56.64]Yeah.
[73:59.10]Anything else you care to add to this conversation here?
[74:03.98]I've got to find a way of canceling the reservation so I can have the room.
[74:07.81]Okay.
[74:08.49]Let's go downstairs to registration and cancel the reception.
[74:10.61]What's the point?
[74:12.13]I can hardly tell her I already have the key to someone else's room.
[74:15.05]What about the diary?
[74:21.41]Police ID.
[74:22.37]It's too risky to show her this fake ID.
[74:25.87]Photo of somebody eating breakfast.
[74:28.37]I don't know.
[74:29.05]Key 227.
[74:29.83]It's not worth making her suspicious with that.
[74:33.95]Can I do anything else?
[74:37.03]I asked the young lady to distract the receptionist for a minute.
[74:41.71]Good work.
[74:43.83]Now give me 225.
[74:44.33]The receptionist is busy.
[74:55.51]She hasn't got her eye on me anymore.
[74:57.45]So can I go behind the computer?
[75:01.87]I have a feeling this trash can is going to come in handy.
[75:04.69]Yeah, I just met this girl 15 minutes ago.
[75:06.71]Now she's like a spy helper.
[75:07.67]She's going to piss the little devil.
[75:14.51]What am I supposed to do about this?
[75:17.87]I can't click on the computer?
[75:21.87]Do it again.
[75:22.61]I missed the boat.
[75:23.92]I asked my accomplice to distract her again.
[75:27.18]Set fire to the trash.
[75:31.54]I thought I made that joke like 10 minutes ago and it didn't do anything.
[75:41.40]Police card.
[75:44.06]Film.
[75:45.22]Are you telling me I can't wrap around here?
[75:49.92]The receptionist is busy.
[75:50.46]What's the point of the distraction?
[75:51.98]She hasn't got her eye on me anymore.
[75:59.78]Oh my god, I...
[76:04.98]It actually worked.
[76:05.70]No, it's not.
[76:06.78]She's... Do it now.
[76:07.62]What was that for?
[76:08.72]I did that for no reason.
[76:10.30]What?
[76:10.50]Gotta go fast.
[76:45.06]Okay, go.
[76:45.26]How do I get up?
[76:48.58]Go over there now?
[76:49.36]How do I... No, no, no.
[76:50.72]Two, two, two.
[76:51.80]I've managed to ascertain from the register that room 227 was occupied by a lady and that the next room was reserved in the name of a private club.
[76:59.74]I'm standing over the fire.
[77:04.03]I was just on top of that.
[77:04.93]So it's a woman in room 227.
[77:07.45]Probably Marcos' lover.
[77:09.29]Oh.
[77:10.05]225 is reserved under the name of Club Zanzibar.
[77:12.71]Okay.
[77:13.61]Zanzibar.
[77:15.13]I know that name from Marcos's Odds and Ends.
[77:18.89]Yes, by the way, that's a different actor.
[77:20.21]So I guess what happened is they paid this guy X amount of money to do a certain amount of lines.
[77:26.32]And then in post-production, they realized, oh, fuck, we're missing a lot of dialog where it needs to be to help the player decide what to do next.
[77:34.48]So the guy in engineering probably just recorded like 50 lines.
[77:38.90]And he tried his best.
[77:40.55]Happens all the time.
[77:41.93]I tried everything I could, but couldn't get any more out of the receptionist.
[77:47.97]Don't you do it, Comcast.
[77:49.01]Don't you fucking do it.
[77:51.63]I just glanced over here and saw yellow for a second.
[77:56.03]Don't you fucking dare.
[77:57.19]Not right when we're getting into this.
[77:58.39]I think we're okay.
[78:02.37]I think we're okay.
[78:03.16]Everybody just relax.
[78:04.99]Alright.
[78:05.65]We're fine.
[78:06.05]Let's keep going.
[78:06.83]We're fine for now.
[78:08.49]Alright.
[78:09.19]Book of matches.
[78:11.19]So I need to... Can I go up?
[78:14.33]Maybe I should go upstairs again?
[78:16.81]I've got to find a way of canceling the reservation so I can have the room.
[78:21.32]Did you say yellow mustard?
[78:23.78]I did.
[78:25.18]I can't hear anything.
[78:26.06]So there's nothing else.
[78:28.06]I have to convince her somehow.
[78:29.50]So I have no more distractions.
[78:31.16]Telephone.
[78:33.55]Wait, can I call the front desk from here?
[78:36.53]I don't know yet who to call.
[78:39.45]I don't know yet who to call.
[78:40.37]Just call the front desk.
[78:46.54]Just call the front desk.
[78:54.33]Shit.
[78:54.77]Can I leave?
[78:57.39]Call 9-1-1.
[79:00.33]I don't know yet who to call.
[79:01.45]Alright.
[79:01.71]I'm going to have to do some investigative reporting here.
[79:03.75]Alright.
[79:05.31]Inventory, we've got film, electronic diary.
[79:07.75]Let's look at this in 3D.
[79:08.41]What do we got?
[79:13.99]Nothing?
[79:15.49]Can't do anything with this?
[79:21.21]No.
[79:21.57]OK.
[79:21.73]Another one with electronic diary.
[79:24.23]Book of Matches.
[79:26.07]Book of Matches has something on it, right?
[79:28.56]Right there?
[79:30.64]No?
[79:36.30]Photo?
[79:38.10]Any phone numbers on here?
[79:41.86]No.
[79:44.08]Uh, police ID card.
[79:46.09]Got a phone... What?
[79:49.17]Okay.
[79:49.95]Police ID card.
[79:50.77]We got a phone number on here?
[79:51.59]This paper is a fake.
[79:53.29]Who does this crook think he is, fooling us that he's a cop?
[79:59.97]Is that his phone number?
[80:02.43]No, phone numbers don't have letters.
[80:07.04]I don't know yet who to call.
[80:10.74]Book of Matches.
[80:13.04]Yeah, right there, right?
[80:14.10]So why can I not call this?
[80:15.68]Do I have to find the other piece of paper?
[80:21.44]Oh, I can spin it around.
[80:26.14]Nothing on the back.
[80:30.30]Damn it.
[80:35.02]Okay, what about the photo?
[80:41.70]Photo.
[80:43.06]Spin it around.
[80:45.77]I'm sending you Eraser to get the film back from the guy who's been bugging you.
[80:50.31]He's good.
[80:50.75]Keep cool.
[80:51.75]He'll sort everything out real quick.
[80:55.03]It's signed Paul.
[80:56.69]From Paul.
[80:57.19]Paul Lagrange, the politician, of course.
[80:59.80]The guy I photographed with Marcos.
[81:02.44]So he was the one who sent Fatso to get the film from my place while I was supposed to be meeting Marcos.
[81:08.02]Fatso.
[81:09.36]So now I gotta call Paul.
[81:12.02]Paul?
[81:15.86]Inventory.
[81:16.92]Now let's take a look at that matches again.
[81:19.36]Maybe I can... Alright, now call Paul.
[81:23.79]Paul?
[81:24.93]I don't know yet who to call.
[81:25.91]What?
[81:28.66]What else do I have?
[81:30.28]Police ID.
[81:30.98]Maybe I spin this around?
[81:36.77]No, no phone numbers on this fucking thing.
[81:41.89]Film?
[81:43.53]Nothing on here, right?
[81:45.91]Special phone number?
[81:49.73]The only thing I have not checked is the key.
[81:52.76]Key.
[81:54.98]Key.
[81:58.17]227, nothing.
[82:00.93]Damn.
[82:04.89]Maybe I should go talk to the front desk now that I know that Paul is... It's no good.
[82:08.15]She said that unless the client cancels, the reservation stands.
[82:15.24]Memory management.
[82:17.08]Jokers.
[82:19.88]25% progress.
[82:20.36]Getting close, man.
[82:21.06]Okay, inventory we got.
[82:24.26]Book of Matches.
[82:27.82]Somebody said book of matches and photo.
[82:32.08]It's not doing anything.
[82:33.91]Photo and book of matches.
[82:36.69]No.
[82:38.47]That's what I want to do.
[82:39.29]I want to call the hotel and pretend to be Paul.
[82:41.13]Alright, what about this watch?
[82:43.61]Push the winder.
[82:47.40]No, is it going to do anything?
[82:48.28]11-12-1-4-6.
[82:48.96]There's the number.
[82:49.66]1-1-1-1-1-2-1-4-6-8.
[83:01.81]Oh.
[83:10.21]OK.
[83:15.29]What the fuck am I doing?
[83:24.79]What?
[83:27.91]I don't know what that was for.
[83:31.99]Okay.
[83:34.47]Remove the winder.
[83:38.23]Put winder in here to get it to midnight and then put it back.
[83:42.55]And then turn it.
[83:44.57]Is there a phone number on here?
[83:50.04]What the fuck is happening?
[84:10.71]Use your cell phone?
[84:11.73]What am I going to turn the disk?
[84:15.40]I can't.
[84:25.28]The phone number's probably inside the watch.
[84:29.74]Turn the disk.
[84:30.42]I can't.
[84:31.50]So let me, hold on.
[84:32.19]Let me turn this back around.
[84:35.61]What happens if I pull the pin?
[84:39.53]No.
[84:39.73]11, 12.
[84:40.91]Why are these lit up?
[84:42.29]Did I fix the watch?
[84:45.69]I think the watch works now.
[84:48.60]I did it.
[84:48.94]I don't know what this does.
[84:58.52]Now reset the watch.
[85:03.21]Oh, I don't know.
[85:17.56]I don't know.
[85:19.92]I don't know yet who to call.
[85:24.30]I need to figure this out.
[85:25.06]This game is so fun and so funny.
[85:26.98]We need to get this figured out.
[85:28.82]Should I use one of my jokers?
[85:34.60]You get three jokers, which gives you a hint.
[85:37.50]You can only do it three times.
[85:42.14]Max, the reservation on the register is under the name of Club Zanzibar, and you have the phone number of the club.
[85:48.99]So if you really want to know who the room has been reserved for, start thinking and give them a call.
[85:55.78]I used a goddamn joker card for that.
[86:02.49]Club Zanzibar, it's on the book of matches.
[86:06.99]But I don't have the fucking phone number.
[86:09.24]Where is it?
[86:13.84]It's torn.
[86:22.23]On the keyboard, no.
[86:29.40]I have to find the torn part.
[86:31.52]But I can't leave.
[86:32.32]I can't believe I wasted a fucking joker card on that.
[86:37.78]Um... Wait, I gotta go back upstairs.
[86:42.14]Hold on.
[86:42.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[86:43.66]Go upstairs.
[86:46.58]Nothing else for me to grab.
[86:49.77]Room 227.
[86:51.13]I can't do anything in either of these rooms.
[86:56.31]Is the torn part in the trash?
[86:57.49]Well, I already burnt the trash.
[87:01.71]I can't hear anything.
[87:07.09]The trash on fire.
[87:13.55]On the floor next to the flower pot.
[87:21.11]I'm not getting any indicators.
[87:24.20]I can't do anything with the trash anymore.
[87:27.28]We really are doing pixel hunting.
[87:31.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[87:33.76]She doesn't have the number.
[87:36.80]Apply the photo to the matchbox.
[87:42.02]Photo to matchbox.
[87:43.44]No, it doesn't do anything.
[87:46.38]So I have to do, it's the watch.
[87:51.95]But what am I supposed to do with the watch?
[87:57.17]It's by the table.
[87:59.51]It's not by the table?
[88:01.28]What table?
[88:05.28]What?
[88:08.52]Go to my memory bank?
[88:11.85]Oh, fuck you.
[88:13.59]Not you guys, not you.
[88:15.77]The game.
[88:18.31]I didn't even need to waste a joker card for this.
[88:20.73]God damn it.
[88:25.04]Alright, call Club Zanzibar.
[88:26.72]Not you guys.
[88:27.12]I'm saying fuck your game.
[88:28.04]I already knew all this.
[88:29.04]We already deducted it.
[88:29.82]We already deducted this.
[88:46.63]Alright, I'll pick up the phone and call the receptionist.
[88:48.89]I pretended to be Mr. Lagrange and canceled his reservation for room 225.
[88:52.85]I was hiding behind the plant so she couldn't hear or see me.
[89:01.56]Hey, it's me.
[89:03.12]I finally got hold of the key to the room next to Marcos's.
[89:06.60]At last, I was going to find out who was in there.
[89:09.22]I hope it's the pizza guy again.
[89:12.35]Don't you guys hope it's that guy that was eating the pizza and shit?
[89:15.33]I hope so.
[89:16.33]Let's see.
[89:16.95]Moment of truth.
[89:17.95]Who's in 225?
[89:26.26]Just a dirty hotel room.
[89:28.34]Should I call the receptionist from down here?
[89:32.10]To the corridor.
[89:32.78]It's just the telephone.
[89:34.72]Paper.
[89:36.50]I got that stored into my memory.
[89:37.78]What is it?
[89:40.72]Champagne.
[89:42.58]Champagne, that's good to know.
[89:45.90]Room service served at any time.
[89:48.38]Okay.
[89:50.73]Is that it?
[89:54.59]Should I call the room next to me?
[89:56.23]Why am I doing the thing that you did when you were 12 years old?
[89:59.73]And you and your family went on a vacation together?
[90:02.66]And you thought it was so cool that you could call your little brother or call your big brother from the other room?
[90:10.40]I called the person in the room next door.
[90:12.86]It seemed I had gotten her out of the tub.
[90:15.03]I pretended that I had the wrong number, and then I tried to check out the situation by doing a bit of smooth talking.
[90:21.13]She was pretty cagey, but I wasn't gonna give up that easily.
[90:23.99]This guy sucks.
[90:24.97]Should I call room service?
[90:31.30]Now that I heard her voice, I was expecting an eventful evening.
[90:35.00]I ordered champagne for room 227 and waited for room service to come.
[90:40.76]This is creepy.
[90:43.40]Hey, hey, what's up?
[90:44.74]I'm next door, I know that just called you too, and I ordered champagne for you too.
[90:49.10]Hey, hi, how are you?
[90:54.60]Good thing I got the room open.
[90:55.66]There's not a fire in there.
[91:02.36]What?
[91:03.44]Oh, I spent too much time dicking around, do it again.
[91:08.50]I decided to try the same strategy again, promising myself I'd be bolder the next time she came to the door.
[91:14.10]I'm just harassing this lady.
[91:17.83]Hey, well, is it gonna work this time?
[91:21.73]No, no, I didn't order any fucking champagne, man.
[91:24.03]Like, leave me alone.
[91:24.83]Hey, it's me.
[91:28.82]A shiver went right down my spine.
[91:31.26]She had the kind of killer smile that could put you down and out for the count.
[91:35.65]Ada Wortmuller, a Jerma ecological politics student fresh out of Karlsruhe University.
[91:41.04]And I was really, really driven by her convictions.
[91:43.76]She had seduced Marcos to infiltrate his circle.
[91:46.24]I was really, really driven to her Hamburglar cosplay.
[91:49.79]It was really turning me on.
[91:51.61]She clearly had no idea he was dead.
[91:54.77]And I certainly didn't feel like being the one to break the news.
[91:59.09]In any case, I sure was crazy about her.
[92:02.21]And I wasn't going to let anybody ruin this very special moment.
[92:07.49]Matches on bed, go!
[92:11.63]Where's she going?
[92:12.59]Off the balcony?
[92:13.37]This guy's very lame.
[92:27.84]I just like creepily ordered champagne to her door twice.
[92:31.14]And then walked in her fucking room.
[92:36.55]It'll hold it on my face and fucking kill me.
[92:43.42]I'd come to see my buddy Freddy, a newspaper columnist, to entrust him with my precious film.
[92:48.18]As soon as it was developed, everybody would be able to see that Tony Marcos, the trafficker, and Paul Lagrange, the politician, were in cahoots.
[92:55.03]And not everybody was going to like it.
[92:56.37]Freddy was an honest guy.
[92:58.41]He was determined to publish the photos even if it put his own family in danger.
[93:02.29]In the meantime, I decided to continue my inquiry at the Club Zanzibar, which, surprise, surprise, was run by Lagrange.
[93:11.33]What was the purpose of the entire hotel scene?
[93:13.83]I don't know.
[93:16.84]Poot?
[93:18.46]Oh, no, it's pool.
[93:23.34]Oh, no, I thought it was an actual swimming pool.
[93:26.46]No, it's pool as in stick and the balls in the holes.
[93:32.49]Alright, I'm going to pee.
[93:34.05]I'll be right back.
[93:39.09]See you in two minutes.
[95:54.02]OK, shall we continue?
[96:00.88]Stick my headset back in.
[96:04.29]And hey, there we are.
[96:06.33]So pull.
[96:07.85]Should I stick my fingers in his ears?
[96:10.21]I think this is the only thing I can do.
[96:15.53]Should I try to put the music back on?
[96:20.14]That's a little atmospheric.
[96:21.70]Let's see if the audio is still terrible.
[96:25.38]Go in.
[96:26.12]Yeah, what is it?
[96:29.25]Um... Sergio.
[96:32.61]I want to shoot some pool.
[96:33.53]Can I come in?
[96:34.55]No, it's members only in here.
[96:38.27]Wait a minute.
[96:39.39]The 8 opens up... Like, fucking Grimace from The Wizard of Oz.
[96:44.76]The guy that opens up the thing.
[96:48.84]What, uh, I thought I already told you.
[96:50.70]This guy's wearing a ski mask.
[96:51.73]Hey, it's the fucking police, buddy.
[96:57.85]How'd you like to earn a big tip?
[96:59.95]Okay, slick, let's see what you got.
[97:01.83]But don't get tricky on me.
[97:03.13]You hear?
[97:04.29]Wait, I thought the guy was wearing a ski mask.
[97:05.93]Alright, I got the door open.
[97:10.52]I told Sergio I had some time to kill and that I'd like to shoot some pool.
[97:14.48]He didn't seem particularly moved by my situation.
[97:19.75]Why would you... Why would you close?
[97:22.19]Okay, quit fooling around.
[97:23.21]I've had about enough of you.
[97:24.17]Why don't you go play in traffic?
[97:26.44]Oh, it's me again.
[97:27.98]Hello?
[97:30.96]I want to come in and play pool.
[97:33.88]This is a sticky beginning to get on my nerves.
[97:37.00]Hey, but this time... Hey, you know me already.
[97:38.80]This time, I got something different.
[97:40.06]Hold on.
[97:40.40]Have you ever seen a watch like this?
[97:43.04]I've got something you're gonna like.
[97:45.00]Okay, Slick, let's see what you got.
[97:46.92]But don't get tricky on me.
[97:48.63]You hear?
[97:49.60]Don't worry.
[97:50.18]Here, man.
[97:54.37]It is a secret in there.
[97:55.37]I don't know what it is, but there's a hidden treasure in there if you fuck with it long enough.
[97:58.37]That guy looks like a dork.
[97:59.01]Okay, make three difficult shots.
[98:00.23]I think I can do it.
[98:21.54]Loosening up, Sergio happened to mention there was another entrance to the club that led to a dead end alley.
[98:25.46]It's raining inside of this place?
[98:26.42]And the boss used this door with its three coated locks to slip in and out discreetly.
[98:32.17]What is going on right now?
[98:33.43]Why is he getting so close?
[98:38.19]The music just... Before the pool game was over, I'd managed to get the low down on La Grange, thanks to Sergio.
[98:44.42]Going back to the hotel to be with my beautiful Ada, completely unaware another storm was brewing.
[98:49.74]Hold on a second.
[98:51.95]Am I just having sex with everybody?
[98:52.77]Hold your fist in anger.
[98:53.27]I'll get you, Inspector Gadget.
[98:54.07]This guy's really into gum.
[98:55.03]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to... Keep...
[99:24.00]You know, that costs a lot of money still.
[99:26.37]Surprised they had the funding to do that.
[99:27.43]By the way, I'm dressed like shit in comparison.
[99:28.89]I look like a dummy.
[99:29.51]Oh, honey, I wish you told me this was a formal affair and I wouldn't be in my fucking Muppet outfit. ...
[99:56.37]What?
[100:01.01]My memory is empty.
[100:02.45]I have no knowledge.
[100:05.96]Electronic diary.
[100:07.48]On keypad.
[100:10.06]3D.
[100:14.02]No.
[100:14.56]Nothing.
[100:15.00]It's too dark up.
[100:15.90]My solar powered calculator doesn't work.
[100:19.41]Uh, what about chalk?
[100:21.61]Alright, let's draw chalk all over this.
[100:26.38]I used the oldest trick in the book to work out the work code from my boss's office.
[100:30.18]Fingerprints.
[100:31.46]Sergio, the guy from the pool hall, would never have guessed just how useful his little gift turned out to be.
[100:36.40]I don't get it.
[100:38.32]What, you put chalk all over it, and then you wait till the guy comes over and presses the buttons?
[100:43.46]Oh, no, the guy has, like, greasy potato chip fingers.
[100:45.56]Okay.
[100:45.72]Now we've got the fingerprints.
[100:47.34]It should be easier.
[100:48.72]Yes, it is, but still, I need to think a second.
[100:54.54]4290, alright, hold on.
[100:55.42]Well, that has to go off.
[101:01.79]Two fo- hold on.
[101:02.99]Inventory.
[101:05.17]Police ID card.
[101:09.55]3D.
[101:09.59]0254!
[101:09.85]Ladies and gentlemen, there it is!
[101:13.71]What?
[101:17.59]But that wasn't even- I don't understand.
[101:24.01]Hold on, wait, did I get it?
[101:26.69]Two, four, nine.
[101:27.05]Oh, two, four, nine.
[101:49.16]Great.
[101:49.84]I saw the last three digits.
[101:52.06]Two, four, nine.
[101:55.12]O249.
[101:56.04]Still, it shouldn't be too hard to find which.
[101:59.28]O249.
[101:59.72]See, you guys thought I fucked it all up.
[102:05.42]I didn't.
[102:05.91]I just thought the guy had a really easy password.
[102:09.01]Careful now.
[102:09.97]It's not in the bag yet.
[102:11.69]Hold on.
[102:12.69]Save this.
[102:13.09]This could go really bad.
[102:24.71]Save game.
[102:26.27]Labyrinth.
[102:27.19]Save.
[102:29.29]Guard.
[102:31.21]Plastic cup.
[102:31.81]Keyboard.
[102:33.93]Say that again.
[102:34.79]I think this guy's dead.
[102:55.00]Can't like whack.
[103:00.51]Poison his coffee?
[103:02.73]Chalking his coffee.
[103:03.49]He's going to be so pissed off.
[103:06.07]No.
[103:06.25]Chalking his coffee.
[103:07.63]No, that's not what I was saying.
[103:14.40]I know nobody said that.
[103:15.46]I did.
[103:15.94]And I take the full responsibility for it.
[103:18.92]Stop it, Max.
[103:19.92]You're going to wake him.
[103:22.69]The elevator's operated by this keyboard.
[103:25.29]Too bad he's got his hands on it.
[103:27.19]Can I make him pee?
[103:28.60]Can I put his right hand in the coffee and make him pee?
[103:31.18]Alright, plastic cup in his hand.
[103:35.82]I'm going to really freak this guy out.
[103:37.06]Are you crazy or something?
[103:40.96]What are you doing?
[103:43.02]Relax.
[103:43.52]It's an old Boy Scout trick.
[103:46.16]He's going to pee.
[103:47.40]He's going to pee his pants.
[103:51.77]I told you.
[103:53.01]You guys thought I was bullshitting you when I told you this like a year ago.
[103:56.56]This guy pissed his pants.
[104:05.20]Alright, now... System unlock.
[104:14.23]That's all it takes.
[104:14.81]We did it.
[104:15.33]That's one button.
[104:15.99]That's very, very secure.
[104:18.07]Just press the one unlock the whole system button.
[104:21.33]Good.
[104:23.60]Very, very secure stuff.
[104:25.72]Up in the elevator.
[104:26.44]What about the music?
[104:40.45]Hold on a minute.
[104:41.45]What dungeon did they just lock us in?
[104:43.13]Hey!
[104:49.41]OK.
[104:50.25]Cup, right hand.
[104:55.52]That wasn't even a jail.
[104:58.33]They locked us inside like a weird horror movie cell.
[105:06.53]Don't worry, we just have to watch this one more time.
[105:08.19]And then now we press the one caps lock key to delete all security measures.
[105:22.22]That's not even a bathroom?
[105:23.08]Yeah, wait a minute.
[105:24.42]Hold on.
[105:25.12]Hold on.
[105:25.80]What?
[105:27.86]That was not a bathroom.
[105:31.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[105:33.14]Kill me.
[105:34.40]Kill me.
[105:35.66]Put me in the goddamn cell.
[105:36.80]I want to look at that again.
[105:42.76]There's not enough room for a toilet in here.
[105:47.97]What?
[105:56.82]I'm so confused.
[105:58.42]He's actually going into a closet, sleepwalking and pissing in there.
[106:02.99]There was enough room for two coats in there.
[106:14.16]Look at this.
[106:21.58]It's a mirror on the wall.
[106:23.17]Oh, you ruined it for me.
[106:25.19]You ruined it for me.
[106:26.19]That is a mirror.
[106:27.11]I thought he was going into a little broom closet.
[106:33.25]Okay.
[106:34.49]Let's go.
[106:34.97]We did it.
[106:36.47]We did it.
[106:38.53]Up.
[106:43.41]I feel like she's going to double cross me here.
[106:52.02]I can't unsee that, though.
[106:56.60]Oh, hack it.
[106:57.10]Okay.
[106:57.76]All the way down here.
[107:01.54]So we got door, door, door, cupboard.
[107:03.98]Let's go in the first door.
[107:08.56]She's now wearing... Are those sunglasses or those high-tech goggles?
[107:11.71]I don't know what they are.
[107:17.45]Cupboard.
[107:18.77]Why would you put sunglasses on now?
[107:21.16]Of all places.
[107:22.38]Oh, yes.
[107:23.58]I remember now.
[107:25.29]Marcos used to hide a copy of his office key here.
[107:29.01]Alright, well, we got stationary.
[107:33.45]It's somewhere around there.
[107:34.95]Can you feel anything?
[107:36.21]Nope.
[107:37.25]Nothing that feels like a key anyhow.
[107:38.81]Such weird shit in here.
[107:41.33]Stationary, nothing.
[107:43.12]No secret compartment?
[107:46.26]Chalk?
[107:48.42]Card punch.
[107:51.31]Oh, Max, you're so clumsy.
[107:52.59]Alright, so there's the copy.
[107:58.19]Uh, I got office key.
[108:01.35]What?
[108:03.95]What, a key fell out of there?
[108:07.34]Okay.
[108:14.46]Her accent keeps changing.
[108:15.66]Gotta cover our tracks.
[108:18.04]Oh, that takes forever, man.
[108:18.80]You need a vacuum.
[108:19.52]You'll be there all day.
[108:20.88]You'll never get every piece.
[108:24.00]Okay, so we got door here.
[108:25.94]Marco's office.
[108:28.51]I kind of want to check... Let's just go in, right?
[108:34.35]Go in.
[108:36.89]What'd he say?
[108:38.77]Huh?
[108:40.39]Cover me?
[108:45.45]How?
[108:46.69]I'm the one opening the door.
[108:50.73]I'm going to get killed here.
[108:51.83]He's going to be standing over there with a gun.
[108:56.03]We've made it in.
[108:56.81]No, never mind.
[108:59.14]My mystic board, computer, desk.
[109:02.48]Can't make much out.
[109:04.38]Turn the light on.
[109:09.62]Can't make much out.
[109:11.37]Why won't we turn the light on?
[109:13.41]Can't see a thing.
[109:15.39]Blinds?
[109:15.93]Where's the switch?
[109:16.83]Turn it on.
[109:18.50]What the hell are you doing?
[109:20.88]This is where Marcos kept his most confidential papers.
[109:24.06]Okay, let's open it.
[109:26.64]Something needs to be connected here.
[109:28.42]But what?
[109:29.40]Locking mechanism.
[109:32.28]Chalk it up.
[109:34.16]Uh, office key.
[109:36.02]Stick it in there.
[109:37.30]No.
[109:37.74]Alright, back it up.
[109:39.86]Advertisement.
[109:44.99]For what?
[109:47.47]Okay, well, I have a memory of looking at that.
[109:48.90]Marcos mentions Lagrange on this brochure.
[109:51.54]Does that mean the politician is into guns?
[109:54.46]Okay, so he's a gun enthusiast.
[109:56.02]Let's see.
[109:56.42]Guns ad.
[109:58.26]Mentioned this to Paul Lagrange for his collection.
[110:03.79]Marlow Weapons and Munitions.
[110:05.75]New collection.
[110:06.57]Limited offer.
[110:08.07]Okay.
[110:08.31]Letter.
[110:09.95]Letter.
[110:19.01]It's an IOU.
[110:19.69]It's an old sum.
[110:20.49]LaGrange owes Marcos a lot of money.
[110:23.37]Okay, so LaGrange is in debt.
[110:28.39]I understand Paul's language.
[110:32.92]Hereby acknowledge owing Antonio Marcos the sum of $200,000.
[110:39.17]to be paid back before April 19th, 1996 at midnight without further notice.
[110:45.13]Language, please.
[110:47.51]Oh, that says Lagrange.
[110:51.55]Okay, so they owe him 200 grand.
[110:53.45]So he's got that document.
[110:57.39]That thing is from Windows 95.
[110:58.48]A blank document with Marcos' letterhead on it.
[111:01.80]Seems kind of fishy.
[111:03.48]I'll hang on to that.
[111:04.36]So I can forge documents here.
[111:07.06]Use a magnet.
[111:10.67]Use magnet on pot.
[111:13.97]On closet.
[111:16.53]On safe.
[111:18.49]On add.
[111:21.41]Okay, so let me, what is this document?
[111:24.17]Let's 3D print this.
[111:26.49]Antonio Marcos.
[111:28.71]I can just put whatever I want in here.
[111:32.01]Just wipe his computer with the magnet.
[111:35.57]Alright, safe magnet, right?
[111:40.94]Magnet on mechanism?
[111:42.16]Come on now, really?
[111:43.07]Is there nothing else I can do here?
[111:48.27]Closet.
[111:52.39]Open it up.
[111:57.54]Why are we doing this?
[112:01.04]Are we hiding?
[112:01.64]That could be a good hiding place if need be.
[112:06.36]Yeah.
[112:06.74]The lock's open.
[112:08.66]Hold on, can I...
[112:11.99]It works.
[112:12.99]We can close it with a magnet.
[112:16.13]Oh, fuck.
[112:17.51]I don't know what to do now.
[112:20.49]The lock's shut.
[112:24.83]Okay, so I don't know what this is for then.
[112:27.35]I guess I can throw somebody in this closet and magnetize it.
[112:31.87]No, what?
[112:33.69]What's this for?
[112:36.65]If I lock us in here, they can just open it with their hand.
[112:46.94]hiding yeah that's fine but if somebody wanted to look in the closet they just would have to open it you won't be suspicious what if you're already suspicious looking for somebody aren't you going to look in the one place that is really easy to go to and hide in a closet oh alright whatever I need to figure out how to get into this safe
[113:13.93]What do I have?
[113:14.47]I have chalk, office key, a document, diary.
[113:19.97]I don't think I can do anything about this right now.
[113:26.83]I have the ad, the IOU.
[113:28.61]There's nothing else here to do.
[113:30.53]I guess I already took the magnet, but... Nothing else on this?
[113:36.69]Marcos mentions Lagrange on this brochure.
[113:39.63]Does that mean the politician is into guns?
[113:44.95]Invisible ink.
[113:45.97]What?
[113:46.59]Interesting.
[113:48.39]Use ink on putt.
[113:49.95]Use ink on... Wait for it now.
[113:53.90]On the document, right?
[113:55.86]Open up the document.
[113:57.64]3D printed.
[113:59.14]And then there's going to be invisible ink in here, right?
[114:00.80]So... Use the office document on the desk.
[114:12.03]Use the ink...
[114:14.53]on the pot use the ink on the letter use the ink on the ad use the ink on the safe use the ink on the telephone I would think I could do this right ink on the document but that doesn't work I can't do anything with that and I'll say I have to do it in reverse
[114:44.80]No.
[114:47.03]Drink it and turn invisible.
[114:51.65]Office key, Tony's key ring on mechanism.
[114:54.85]No, that doesn't work either.
[114:57.40]Memory.
[114:57.88]I only have these two things from memory.
[115:02.02]Invisible ink, it doesn't reveal invisible writing.
[115:08.67]You know what?
[115:09.95]You're right.
[115:11.46]That's right.
[115:12.78]Invisible ink is invisible ink.
[115:14.36]It's not revealing liquid.
[115:18.55]There's another room I could go.
[115:19.79]What's the other room?
[115:21.05]There's another room over here that maybe she was like, don't go in there.
[115:28.71]What am I doing?
[115:30.77]Oh.
[115:30.87]Remember this other door?
[115:35.53]Don't waste your time with the door, Max.
[115:37.49]Why?
[115:38.29]I can't look around?
[115:41.85]Okay, here's another locked door.
[115:47.62]Don't waste your time with the door, Max.
[115:51.60]There's nothing else here.
[115:54.78]I actually just have to go in here.
[115:56.02]Because there's no... What about the cupboard?
[115:59.18]Invisible ink on the cupboard?
[116:06.77]Nothing in the office.
[116:09.11]Should I use the joker card here?
[116:11.45]What's my progress?
[116:13.65]35%, almost halfway through this.
[116:20.43]Use the chalk on the document.
[116:30.46]That's not doing anything.
[116:37.10]I can't do, I can't put, there's no chalk in it, no.
[116:40.12]Open the document and then put the chalk in there.
[116:44.26]I don't have a pen.
[116:44.95]Let's go back in here.
[116:53.63]Look at the document while you're in the closet.
[116:55.66]Well, like it has glow.
[116:56.94]Open the fucking door.
[117:01.18]What the hell was that?
[117:02.26]I just locked it.
[117:09.95]Get in there.
[117:14.15]It locked the door.
[117:16.11]OK, closet.
[117:18.75]No, this is no reason for me to go in here.
[117:22.57]There's no light in there.
[117:37.25]No, you guys, there's no glow in the dark ink.
[117:41.97]That would be really funny if there was, though.
[117:53.43]Write vacant.
[117:58.16]You can turn the lights off.
[118:00.66]Yeah, no.
[118:01.76]There's no invisible ink.
[118:04.08]And by invisible, I'm talking, look.
[118:06.49]Can't make much out.
[118:07.61]Look, I'm going to try.
[118:08.31]I'm just going to do this so people can stop this nonsense.
[118:11.59]This is not going to show anything.
[118:12.73]There's no... Turn the light back on.
[118:24.48]Document on pot.
[118:28.22]Chalk on pot.
[118:32.75]I can't use the computer.
[118:36.19]The opening system is behind here.
[118:38.83]Okay, the opening system is behind here.
[118:41.65]There's nothing I can do about this.
[118:43.82]No magnet, that doesn't work.
[118:51.08]I'm about to use a joker.
[118:53.25]Having trouble with Marco's safe?
[118:55.51]Don't give up.
[118:56.67]Use the wire that's in the pencil holder to plug in the electric diary and get some answers.
[119:01.04]What the fuck are you talking about?
[119:02.06]I've just given you the secret code, and the password is simply A-D-D-A.
[119:07.28]Why would you do that?
[119:08.58]Hold on.
[119:10.74]Alright.
[119:11.40]Like... An electric cord.
[119:13.68]It's my lucky day.
[119:16.56]I mean, come on now.
[119:17.96]Like, how the fuck was I supposed to...
[119:33.47]Something needs to be connected here.
[119:35.27]But what?
[119:36.53]The wire.
[119:43.25]Alright.
[119:46.20]I couldn't even see that shit on the table.
[119:49.12]Locking mechanism.
[119:49.90]Now connect that.
[119:50.68]What does it have to be connected up with?
[119:52.60]Put it to your tongue.
[120:01.88]The opening system is behind here.
[120:04.96]What did he say?
[120:05.32]The pencil holder?
[120:09.52]Right.
[120:15.15]Didn't he say... Wait, what did I... Use the diary.
[120:17.67]Oh, the diary.
[120:20.65]Why am I saying pencil holder?
[120:22.73]Wait, am I going to put it in the pencil holder?
[120:24.57]Ugh.
[120:32.89]Alright.
[120:33.17]Oh, this sounds like Kirby 1 shows up on screen.
[120:35.59]Alright.
[120:35.85]Diary.
[120:37.35]Let's use it.
[120:39.12]A-D-D-A.
[120:41.58]Turn it on, you idiot.
[120:42.94]DD said he'd crack the diary's secret code.
[120:46.46]It's your room number, sweetheart.
[120:48.36]So come on now.
[120:49.58]Rack your brains.
[120:51.69]A-D-D-A.
[120:56.55]Wrong code.
[121:10.16]Didi said he'd crack the diary's secret code.
[121:13.66]It's your room number, sweetheart.
[121:15.58]So come on now, rack your brains.
[121:29.01]It was our lucky night.
[121:30.15]There was a whole file on an organization called the Elite sitting in Marcos' safe.
[121:34.73]I could already picture the kind of stuff the Elite must be involved in.
[121:38.02]Nice sleep Twitch.
[121:40.86]I was looking forward to a good evening.
[121:42.34]You can hear us?
[121:43.22]Okay, we gotta lock ourselves in the closet.
[121:44.90]In the meantime, though, we had to get back out without being seen.
[121:49.36]Back out without being seen.
[121:50.28]Listen, it's the security guard.
[121:51.95]Alright, go.
[121:52.93]He's coming.
[121:53.77]Yes.
[121:53.91]Quick, hide.
[121:55.05]Into the closet.
[121:56.63]Get in.
[121:57.73]Magnet, lock the door.
[121:59.62]Oh, shit.
[122:00.06]Turn the lights off.
[122:01.06]Oh, fuck.
[122:01.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[122:01.90]The lights.
[122:03.89]Get out quick.
[122:04.63]Move.
[122:04.93]You gotta move faster than that.
[122:06.25]This is utmost importance.
[122:10.43]Lights off.
[122:11.21]Get in the closet.
[122:17.40]Okay, magnetize.
[122:24.12]Magnet.
[122:26.69]Safe.
[122:27.49]Here we go.
[122:32.19]Now what?
[122:35.95]Oh, fuck.
[122:36.29]Here he comes.
[122:36.77]Okay.
[122:41.17]I tried that door too.
[122:42.95]No one in there, man.
[122:46.47]The lock's shut.
[122:54.85]Okay.
[122:57.81]I want to see what happens if I do this.
[123:06.41]Alright.
[123:06.89]No confetti on the ground.
[123:11.37]Music?
[123:19.00]Here he comes!
[123:21.08]The door's unlocked?
[123:21.88]That's alright, he's not gonna come in here.
[123:26.36]Wait, this one's been tampered with.
[123:31.64]He's in the room?
[123:33.30]Has he tried to come in yet?
[123:52.03]Okay, nevermind.
[123:54.67]Say load.
[123:56.93]Load.
[123:59.98]Load.
[124:01.70]Okay, get outta here.
[124:07.22]Go out.
[124:12.90]Lock the door.
[124:13.72]Okay, lock this door.
[124:29.31]Lock it.
[124:34.41]OK, it's locked.
[124:37.21]You probably just heard that.
[124:38.11]Alright, now hide in the closet.
[124:44.38]The lights are off.
[124:45.06]What do you mean the lights?
[124:46.30]The lights are off.
[124:46.78]No, that's a magnet.
[124:51.40]Hurry.
[124:53.23]Okay.
[124:54.97]I think we're safe in here.
[125:00.57]No, the light's on.
[125:01.51]No, you're gonna have the lights off.
[125:05.57]The lights are off.
[125:06.61]We're fine.
[125:07.17]The lights, they're not on.
[125:10.42]You wanted me to turn around and hit the button to turn the lights on and freak myself out.
[125:25.61]Here he comes.
[125:27.01]Oh fuck, this is so scary!
[125:29.55]What if he comes in here and starts fucking stabbing us?
[125:31.67]I wish there was a screen button.
[125:51.51]Quick, get me a cup with water in it.
[125:53.53]He can't resist.
[126:04.14]No, wait, the lights are off?
[126:10.67]The lights are off.
[126:16.33]No, I'm not going to open the door.
[126:19.59]He's holding a camera.
[126:23.81]He's got a huge camera.
[126:26.66]This is one of the fucking filmmakers.
[126:30.70]No, what?
[126:36.39]Open the door and, like, attack him?
[126:40.01]No, no, no, no.
[126:40.53]He's gonna do it.
[126:41.31]No, he's not.
[126:41.69]Crisis occurred.
[127:04.58]Save it.
[127:08.32]Labyrinth.
[127:08.84]Yep.
[127:10.12]Give me up.
[127:12.08]Out.
[127:12.90]Out.
[127:15.35]No.
[127:18.63]It's unlocked, right?
[127:19.67]Did he lock it?
[127:22.81]Yes, he did.
[127:24.55]What's the lady's name?
[127:27.01]Ada.
[127:27.91]Watch out, the guard's coming back.
[127:30.11]What?
[127:32.10]It's coming back.
[127:33.52]Can we hide in the cupboard?
[127:41.37]We can, right?
[127:44.35]Yes.
[127:45.39]It's like hiding in these little areas.
[127:47.03]Alright, jump out and hit him.
[127:50.33]I might have an opportunity to.
[127:51.21]No, we're not going to get caught.
[128:01.52]We're fine.
[128:04.48]He'll take his pesticide light.
[128:05.66]I couldn't believe the information in Marcos' file.
[128:08.64]Marcos, Lagrange, and someone named Kvork were apparently at the head of a totalitarian underground organization called the Elite.
[128:16.58]It was incredible.
[128:17.24]The Elite.
[128:18.40]All three men had microfilm implanted under their skin containing the access code to the Elite's secret database, which was hidden somewhere in a mysterious research institute.
[128:30.88]There was also a diagram of an electronic device in the file that reminded me of the watch I'd given Sergio at the pool hall.
[128:39.54]I let Freddy know it was much more serious than drug trafficking.
[128:43.51]The members of the Research Institute were knowingly using illegal products manufactured by Marcos under Legrand's political protection.
[128:51.69]But what exactly was going on?
[128:54.07]That's what we had to find out.
[129:00.06]I decided to entrust my new partner with a delicate mission.
[129:03.63]Ada was to go to Marcos' warehouse where I had taken the photos.
[129:06.89]Am I driving her here?
[129:07.57]And find out the address of the research institute.
[129:10.17]Next, she had to try to get a sample of whatever it was they were making.
[129:14.01]Alright, nice, okay, cat woman.
[129:18.65]She's gonna go up and do like a karate kick or something, isn't she?
[129:22.14]Alright, here we go.
[129:23.52]Get a sample.
[129:25.78]Shoot!
[129:26.82]There's nothing going on here.
[129:28.78]The delivery man just moved an empty box.
[129:32.70]Blanket.
[129:33.96]Jacket.
[129:34.38]Take the big oversized blue jacket.
[129:44.38]I don't even know what to see in his postcard.
[129:52.75]Quick, before the guy comes back.
[129:59.86]What's with the dudes not wearing clothes?
[130:01.52]That guy on the right has the open jacket like I did.
[130:04.72]What time period is this?
[130:10.10]Am I gonna hide in the blanket?
[130:12.82]Oh, I thought that was a gun.
[130:16.17]Look at that guy!
[130:17.07]He's got an open jacket with no clothes on!
[130:19.73]Alright, use the tongs on the telephone.
[130:22.47]Telephone.
[130:24.77]Push the telephone buttons.
[130:25.83]Okay, memory.
[130:30.84]Postcard.

[131:18.70]Dirty sheet.
[131:20.14]The address of the elite research institute must be written on the delivery slip.
[131:26.10]I better check it out.
[131:27.50]Do I have to reach with the tongs?
[131:29.82]I can't get the delivery slip without being seen.
[131:32.82]Yeah, I gotta use the old lady grandma tongs.
[131:36.10]Success.
[131:37.18]She found the address of the infamous research institute.
[131:40.29]The front for the elite's shady dealings on a delivery slip.
[131:43.57]That was more suspicious than just grabbing the fucking thing.
[131:48.76]I didn't even put it back to.
[131:51.85]Alright.
[131:52.87]Delivery slip.
[131:56.15]What do we got here?
[131:57.57]We got boxes.
[131:59.11]Nah.

[132:05.53]Delivery note elite immunology 133 root at a Foley nine eight four five six less low Jason for it.
[132:14.33]Here's the address of the elite Research Institute Shouldn't be too hard to find Okay, zoom out And what about this phone number?
[132:26.45]The number of the warehouse is printed on the slip Oh ring-a-ding-ding must ring through to the warehouse supervisors.
[132:32.80]Hey boys and girls looks like we're gonna get a ring-a-ding-ding here.
[132:34.66]Oh
[132:39.21]As soon as she found the number of the warehouse, Ada called the warehouse supervisor from the truck, but she couldn't come up with a way to keep him busy.
[132:47.83]What?
[132:52.27]Just wrong number.
[132:53.53]Okay, well, I need more information now.
[132:56.69]Go back.
[132:59.45]Uh...
[133:01.28]To the exit of the warehouse.
[133:02.58]Alright, what if I reach and use the grab?
[133:10.18]Can I like use the capsule?
[133:12.63]Can I throw the capsule in the guy's mouth from here?
[133:21.43]Something else in the van.
[133:22.25]Did we miss anything else?
[133:26.08]Blanket.
[133:28.35]Phone.
[133:29.23]Chalk.
[133:30.39]Tones.
[133:32.56]Memory.
[133:33.48]Postcard.
[133:34.18]There's a number right there.
[133:41.84]I can't like s- Text.
[133:48.75]Text.
[133:49.23]I can't touch the phone number.
[134:01.28]You said under the van.
[134:03.16]I can't do anything.
[134:08.58]Touch.
[134:10.54]Try going in the blanket.
[134:11.40]There's nothing else under there.
[134:13.10]Jacket.
[134:13.44]Something else in the jacket?
[134:16.02]A laundry ticket.
[134:17.73]Why wouldn't I have picked that up before?
[134:19.31]Give me a break, lady.
[134:22.18]You don't check both pockets?
[134:24.90]Laundry ticket, zoom in.
[134:25.78]The delivery man's called Mr. Felix.
[134:28.76]Mr. Felix.
[134:31.06]Spin it around.
[134:31.66]That's all I need, right?
[134:33.12]Okay, call Mr. Felix.
[134:34.38]Call Garfield.
[134:36.48]Using the laundry ticket she'd found in the delivery man's coat, Ada pretended she was calling on their behalf.
[134:42.48]She asked for Mr. Felix and soon found out the number in the truck.
[134:47.10]So now I gotta tell this guy his dirty laundry's ready?
[134:52.98]Okay, now call the van.
[134:56.12]The line will be busy.
[134:57.94]I'd better ring another number.
[134:59.64]No, call the warehouse now.
[135:00.72]It's a bit risky to use the phone in the van.
[135:03.60]I'm too close to the office.
[135:07.50]Okay.
[135:08.24]Great.
[135:08.97]They're busy talking.
[135:10.63]They don't have any idea I'm here.
[135:13.23]I can't... I have to... Great.
[135:16.25]I found the van's number thanks to her.
[135:19.61]What am I supposed to do now?
[135:26.63]It's a bit risky to use the phone in the van.
[135:29.59]I'm too close to the office.
[135:31.53]So can I exit now?
[135:32.61]Can I leave?
[135:34.66]The delivery man and the storekeeper are in the office.
[135:38.06]I can't get past without being seen.
[135:39.98]I swear to God, there's something else in the jacket.
[135:43.48]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[135:45.51]Oh, he's prepared for everything, isn't he?
[135:49.55]Check the jacket again, apparently.
[135:51.03]No, can't do anything.
[135:55.32]That's all that was in there.
[135:56.76]Why could I use it before?
[135:58.44]Just blow it up like a balloon.
[136:00.28]No, that was like a joke item.
[136:01.72]Okay, the jacket is done.
[136:20.93]Blanket can't be used.
[136:23.25]Shoot the phone.
[136:24.85]Tongues on blanket.
[136:26.51]You got, really?
[136:28.83]No, I'm putting the tongs away.
[136:32.78]To not be suspicious or something?
[136:37.00]Capsule in phone.
[136:39.86]Okay, I can't pick that back up, so I think I was supposed to do that.
[136:46.97]Condom on penis.
[136:49.09]Well, I'm currently playing as a woman.
[136:51.35]I don't even have the condom.
[136:55.98]As long as they stay together, I can keep on looking.
[137:00.32]Capsule in condom.
[137:02.30]To the back of the warehouse.
[137:05.42]There's another car parked at the other end.
[137:07.70]Must be the warehouse supervisors.
[137:10.23]Well, small car.
[137:13.44]Alright, get in there.
[137:24.38]Do I drive this thing around?
[137:25.74]Telephone.
[137:26.30]Alright, use the phone.
[137:27.52]Wait, check the dash first.
[137:30.74]Wait, what phone am I looking at here?
[137:38.25]There's two phones?
[137:41.14]That's in this room, though.
[137:44.94]I just reached out the window.
[137:46.97]Okay, now call the other guy.
[137:48.23]Call the van with this phone.
[138:06.03]I'm just making him get on the line.
[138:11.03]Okay, now what?
[138:15.28]Now that I... What's my end goal?
[138:21.60]What's the end game here?
[138:24.80]Should I put them together and have them talk to each other?
[138:27.84]Put receiver to earpiece and hold the phones together.
[138:35.27]Warehouse.
[138:37.92]Hello.
[138:40.54]Are you kidding me?
[138:43.18]In the end, the Amazing Gator had the brilliant idea of putting the two receivers together, connecting the delivery man and the storekeeper.
[138:52.37]They would figure this out in a second.
[138:55.19]I better get out of here before they realize they're talking to each other.
[138:58.13]Alright, let's get out of here.
[139:01.55]You've got to be kidding me.
[139:05.23]Hey, man, yeah, I was actually just in that room with you.
[139:08.33]Wait, no, we've been had!
[139:09.38]Oh, too bad.
[139:11.14]We just keep coming back here and having, like, sex.
[139:15.32]Where did I get the gun?
[139:28.92]We're missing a lot of the middle part of this story.
[139:30.16]Nice shot, you fucking idiot.
[139:31.04]That's the easiest shot to make and pull.
[139:32.63]What a fail.
[139:57.14]Lagrange clearly used it to come and go without being seen.
[140:01.10]A moment later, I saw a silhouette pass by.
[140:03.76]Then the light in the office went out.
[140:06.08]Something fishy was going on.
[140:07.60]I think you guys aren't realizing that we have a fire.
[140:09.46]I went into the dark office and what I saw turned my blood cold.
[140:12.70]Lagrange sitting there with his hands soaked in ink, his throat cut.
[140:16.08]Oh no!
[140:16.58]Before I even had time to react, the big guy I encountered in my apartment came bursting into the room.
[140:21.39]I frisked Lagrange's pocket and found a key ring like Marcos's and used it in the slot down by the floor.
[140:27.19]Why?
[140:27.45]I don't get to play this.
[140:30.09]It's just telling me.
[140:30.64]The secret passage opened, taking me out into the alley behind the club.
[140:36.76]That would have been a really fun sequence to play, wouldn't it?
[140:41.30]I don't have a gun anymore.
[140:46.62]Nothing in the inventory.
[140:47.50]Uh, okay.
[140:48.02]So that was interesting.
[140:54.64]Uh, go to the end of the hallway, go to the exit.
[140:57.27]Well...
[141:11.19]Go to the end of the alleyway.
[141:12.33]Go to the end of the alleyway.
[141:14.45]Oh no, I'm gonna do the thing where I turn around and the car's coming!
[141:19.47]Wait, what?
[141:21.76]Run at the Jeep!
[141:29.76]You can... You can...
[141:42.56]I wonder if he stops.
[141:54.15]Roll under the car.
[141:56.49]What?
[141:56.79]Was the car just upside down?
[142:01.57]Ada showed up at just the right moment.
[142:04.19]When she was at the bar, she'd heard gunshots coming from the office.
[142:07.19]She immediately rushed off to get the car and to get me out of there.
[142:11.22]The killer had struck again.
[142:12.92]The second of the elite's key men was dead.
[142:15.52]Was someone trying to get even with this evil organization?
[142:18.02]Please stick us back to the hotel room.
[142:19.86]In the early morning hours, I noticed something weird.
[142:24.14]The ink stain on Ada's hand was strangely similar to the one I'd seen on Lagrange's hand.
[142:29.56]She's a double agent.
[142:30.37]I was in a hurry to get the photos Freddie had developed.
[142:33.37]Ada would go and pick them up in the morning.
[142:35.41]She'd take a message I'd handwritten so Freddie would know who she was.
[142:41.33]It's a double agent story.
[142:43.91]Which do you choose?
[142:51.22]Max at the hotel, Ada at the newspaper office.
[142:56.08]We'll leave this up to you guys.
[142:58.25]This seems like a pretty major storyline decision.
[143:02.21]Why don't we let you decide it?
[143:04.79]Put a poll here.
[143:07.83]So this is Max or Ada.
[143:10.48]Excuse me.
[143:12.58]Max or Ada.
[143:20.78]Use SurveyMonkey?
[143:21.78]No.
[143:26.44]Looks like right off the bat, Air Max is absolutely killing it right now.
[143:35.23]To a point where I'm not sure Ada will ever be able to recover.
[143:44.52]Give it another 10 seconds or so.
[143:48.06]Just about, you know?
[143:50.82]Just about.
[143:56.24]alright that was real quick ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and yeah zero max wins by way too much there's no reason to even keep the fall open max is just destroying everything so thank you for voting sorry if you voted for Ada
[144:23.98]I count fast.
[144:25.72]Well, if it was close, maybe we'd... No, it's just not even close, though.
[144:31.06]Okay.
[144:32.36]Max at the hotel.
[144:33.10]Autopsies.
[144:48.57]The way things were working out, I began to wonder if it was a wise choice to come back to the hotel now that the cops and a bunch of killers were on my trail.
[144:56.45]Probably not, but, you know, we don't seem like the smartest guy here.
[145:00.27]Alright, back into the room.
[145:06.64]I soon found out my hunch had been right when the receptionist informed me that Inspector Vandal had just shown up.
[145:13.26]He had a search warrant, so I had to think fast.
[145:17.13]Alright, come back to the scene of the crime.
[145:18.39]Search warrant.
[145:18.73]I persuaded the receptionist to delay the inspector for a few minutes and started to look for the right hiding places.
[145:26.02]More hiding under beds and in closets and shit.
[145:28.42]Okay, that gives me a few seconds to hide all the incriminating evidence I've got in my pockets.
[145:35.19]What?
[145:35.47]I have so much stuff.
[145:38.27]Okay, let's hide that in there.
[145:40.69]Police ID.
[145:41.17]Probably a great hiding place, though.
[145:43.57]Uh...
[145:44.95]Capsule.
[145:45.83]Capsule in mirror.
[145:47.05]No good.
[145:47.53]It won't stay.
[145:48.75]Capsule in bowl.
[145:50.53]Alright, don't take any candies, dude.
[146:02.30]Uh, ink in minibar.
[146:04.79]Why bother hiding that?
[146:06.17]It's not incriminating.
[146:07.39]Okay, wait.
[146:07.75]What else is incriminating?
[146:09.09]Paul's keyring.
[146:09.89]Why bother hiding that?
[146:11.27]It's not incriminating.
[146:12.25]What else is incriminating?
[146:14.70]Doc even?
[146:15.68]No, no.
[146:16.58]Two's too obvious.
[146:18.40]Mirror.
[146:18.87]Behind the mirror.
[146:24.03]It'll do.
[146:25.17]But it's not a great place.
[146:26.73]Anything else incriminating?
[146:31.01]Um... Tony's keyring.
[146:32.75]Isn't this illegal?
[146:33.97]Why bother hiding that?
[146:35.33]It's not incriminating.
[146:36.49]Okay.
[146:36.91]That's not incriminating.
[146:37.65]What about the magnet?
[146:38.37]Magnets are illegal, right?
[146:39.97]Why bother hiding that?
[146:41.35]It's not incriminating.
[146:43.25]Okay.
[146:45.22]We're good.
[146:46.88]Why bother hiding that?
[146:48.26]It's not incriminating.
[146:50.50]Alright.
[146:50.76]Come on in, dude.
[146:51.72]Under the mattress.
[146:53.00]Perfect.
[146:55.11]Wait.
[146:56.11]That's a little too obvious.
[146:57.13]In the minibar.
[146:57.59]Oh, we can put it under the bed.
[146:59.79]Or in the lamp.
[147:03.43]Whiskey.
[147:03.87]What?
[147:05.45]Can I try to, like, offer him a drink or something?
[147:08.99]He's going to sweat it out.
[147:10.27]At last, a little Irish courage.
[147:14.13]I need to hide this somewhere else.
[147:17.15]He's going to open this up.
[147:17.85]Wait, where did it go?
[147:18.43]Behind the bottle.
[147:21.15]I'll hang on to that.
[147:21.87]It isn't such a great hiding place after all.
[147:25.41]Place ID card on.
[147:28.38]It's hidden for the moment, but they'll find it if they search thoroughly.
[147:31.94]Right, so.
[147:32.92]I'll hang on to that.
[147:33.68]Where did I put this?
[147:34.10]In the lamp?
[147:34.34]It isn't such a great hiding place after all.
[147:36.08]Alright.
[147:37.34]Let me see.
[147:38.36]Why do I have everything?
[147:39.46]No, I don't.
[147:40.46]In the lamp.
[147:43.57]No one's going to look inside of a fucking lampshade.
[147:46.30]No good.
[147:46.70]It won't stay.
[147:47.58]Are you kidding me?
[147:50.94]In the mattress.
[147:51.46]Yeah, but he may find it if he searches hard.
[147:54.00]Fuck.
[147:55.02]Where can I put this?
[148:01.09]He's going to see that.
[148:01.59]I'll hang on to that.
[148:02.19]It isn't such a great hiding place after all.
[148:04.11]Not a good hiding place.
[148:04.71]What about the plant?
[148:05.47]Flowers?
[148:09.74]I have a lot of time.
[148:10.42]How do you see it?
[148:12.43]Now you don't.
[148:13.27]I'm going to get off my drink.
[148:14.77]Let's hope that'll do.
[148:19.54]So I got... This is not incriminating.
[148:23.88]Here you go.
[148:24.88]Inspector Vandal came bursting into my room like a pit bull moving in for the kill.
[148:29.74]He tracked me down, and all he needed to pin Marcos' murder on me was some incriminating evidence.
[148:34.66]Don't find it.
[148:35.68]There was no way out.
[148:37.12]The police sketch was obviously of me, and the inspector sure didn't like meddling journalists.
[148:42.60]He searched me as roughly as possible.
[148:44.14]Nothing on me.
[148:44.90]And, liking the idea of putting me away for 30 years, grabbed anything he found lying around.
[148:50.34]No, wait, wait.
[148:50.84]Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[148:54.20]He just... He took all the candy.
[148:58.10]Wait, doesn't this guy love candy?
[149:01.69]What am I looking at?
[149:06.35]Wait, he found everything.
[149:08.17]Uh-oh.
[149:08.83]I'm in deep trouble.
[149:10.19]He found everything.
[149:12.21]How did you find it?
[149:24.21]Ouch, looks like I'm in for it.
[149:32.71]Where was I supposed to put it?
[149:36.59]Is this game, is it over now?
[149:38.99]Put everything under the bed.
[149:43.10]No, the guy's gonna eat the poison candy, watch.
[149:45.30]He's gonna unwrap the capsule and eat it.
[149:49.24]Okay, again I go into the closet.
[149:54.73]That's it.
[149:55.31]Game over.
[149:55.79]Bye.
[149:58.51]Okay.
[149:59.53]Police ID card.
[150:00.51]Under the bed.
[150:02.26]Yeah, but he may find it if he searches hard.
[150:08.28]I need to turn off this loud-ass music.
[150:12.42]Okay, now we can concentrate.
[150:14.74]So this behind the mirror doesn't work.
[150:16.79]In the flowers doesn't work.
[150:17.77]In the bowl doesn't fucking work.
[150:21.31]What if we just put everything under the bed?
[150:26.00]I'm gonna put this in the candy bowl.
[150:28.46]He didn't even know he took it.
[150:33.75]He's gonna die.
[150:35.03]That's one of the secret endings, guaranteed.
[150:37.19]Okay, document under the bed.
[150:41.57]Don't know.
[150:42.37]Two's too obvious.
[150:48.66]In the pillow.
[150:51.68]That's pretty well hidden.
[150:54.34]I'm not sure how good a place it is, though.
[151:02.36]Police ID on the bottle?
[151:04.44]This bar is pretty empty.
[151:13.31]Ah, at last, a little Irish courage.
[151:16.85]OK, so we got whiskey.
[151:22.40]No, whiskey label.
[151:24.93]Whiskey label with police ID.
[151:27.83]Where's the fucking police ID?
[151:29.25]What did I do with it?
[151:30.57]I'll hang on to that.
[151:31.55]It isn't such a great hiding place after all.
[151:33.93]Okay, police ID with the whiskey.
[151:37.01]Marcos' false police ID will fit nicely under the label.
[151:41.79]What a great hiding place.
[151:43.24]What a great job, Chad.
[151:45.80]Don't worry, the Explorer commends you.
[151:47.06]Alright, now put this back.
[151:50.44]So that's just whiskey sitting here.
[151:52.96]Put it back.
[151:54.61]Why bother hiding that?
[151:56.01]It's not incriminating.
[151:58.08]I can hold on to this.
[152:00.94]Okay.
[152:02.06]Whatever.
[152:02.36]Oh, what the fuck?
[152:04.78]Where's the stuff?
[152:15.18]There was no way out.
[152:16.62]The police sketch was obviously of me, and the inspector sure didn't like meddling journalists.
[152:22.11]He searched me as roughly as possible, and, liking the idea of putting me away for 30 years, grabbed anything he found lying around.
[152:29.23]Alright, so there's the candy.
[152:30.75]He's going to take a bunch of candy, and he'll die.
[152:34.60]He doesn't even know what he took.
[152:35.56]You're not going to find this shit under the pillow, right?
[152:42.67]Okay, so hold on a minute.
[152:43.67]So all he found was this document here, right?
[152:51.76]Where'd you find this file, you nosy bastard?
[152:54.00]Uh-oh.
[152:56.02]I'm in deep trouble.
[152:57.20]That's it.
[153:00.48]Don't even think about it, pal.
[153:07.02]You're free to go.
[153:11.73]Let's go.
[153:14.75]Everything I Get inside.
[153:17.86]Oh god.
[153:18.76]Is this the cell?
[153:19.44]This is supposed to be the jail cell.
[153:20.96]You're not going for a little walk pal Yeah, that's the jail cell apparently that is the jail cell whatever try it again here we go turn this off I need to concentrate.
[153:30.91]Oh wait.
[153:31.09]We've got open the mini bar go This bar is pretty empty whiskey label

[153:46.48]Okay.
[153:47.60]Uh... With the ID.
[153:50.98]Oh, you dumb idiot.
[153:53.08]Police card.
[153:54.22]With.
[153:55.64]Label.
[153:55.94]Marcos' false police ID will fit nicely under the label.
[154:00.69]What a great hiding place.
[154:03.69]Ink.
[154:04.59]On documents.
[154:07.93]Stained document.
[154:09.51]Where should I put it?
[154:09.95]Behind the mirror?
[154:11.24]Where should I put it?
[154:11.68]What do I do with it?
[154:12.36]Why bother hiding it?
[154:13.06]Oh, it's not illegal, okay.
[154:13.79]It's not incriminating.
[154:15.13]Okay, now what else?
[154:15.83]Candy?
[154:16.99]I have a stained document.
[154:19.99]The capsule.
[154:21.45]What the fuck do I do?
[154:22.65]Into the bowl?
[154:24.13]That's it, right?
[154:24.91]Into the bowl.
[154:27.41]Then he's gonna, he'll die.
[154:31.16]Look at that.
[154:37.20]I got no other incriminating evidence on me, right?
[154:41.81]I took a flash of red screen, why?
[154:48.14]So I got nothing else, okay.
[154:53.40]Cool.
[154:56.41]Put the whiskey away.
[155:00.69]Why bother hiding that?
[155:01.67]I don't have to hide it anymore.
[155:02.37]It's not incriminating.
[155:05.01]Every time I try to do any of that, he says, I don't have to do that, I just have stained documents.
[155:10.95]Okay, this is fun.
[155:12.99]I'm just lying in bed now.
[155:17.17]I can hide something here.
[155:19.59]Should I bait him with like a magnet?
[155:22.08]Why bother hiding that?
[155:23.48]It's not incriminating.
[155:25.90]Can you turn around?
[155:26.68]No.
[155:27.24]No, this is fine.
[155:27.74]Inspector Vandal came bursting into my room like a pit bull moving in for the kill.
[155:32.14]He's not gonna find anything.
[155:32.80]He tracked me down and all he needed to pin Marcos' murder on me was some incriminating evidence.
[155:38.61]By the way, is that a cough?
[155:39.51]That's like a fucking hotel maintenance guy.
[155:40.51]He took a handful of the candy.
[155:41.53]He's going to just stuff a handful.
[155:42.59]It's like popcorn, guys.
[155:43.07]He doesn't even care about the wrappers.
[155:44.09]Nothing.
[155:44.33]You got nothing.
[155:45.69]Yeah, he's got
[156:08.08]You got a couple of keys.
[156:13.08]The invisible ink.
[156:14.86]Got it.
[156:15.06]You dumped the goods, didn't you?
[156:16.31]Well, you just wait, old buddy, because I'm going to sort you right out.
[156:18.25]That's not what he said.
[156:21.22]Phew, I had won some time.
[156:22.96]But what was coming next?
[156:25.42]All that for a few.
[156:27.30]But convinced I was guilty as hell, Van Dale decided to stop being so nice.
[156:32.01]It didn't take me long to figure out that he was going to kill me if I didn't find a simple but foolproof way out of this.
[156:37.59]If I go in there, I'm a dead man.
[156:39.77]Alright, I got to save it here.
[156:42.09]Alright, clean blanket.
[156:57.26]You want to play smart with me?
[156:58.50]Well, we'll see soon about that, Professor.
[157:02.22]Whiskey on blanket.
[157:14.16]I can't clean blanket.
[157:19.58]Doesn't exactly look comfortable.
[157:21.64]I don't really fancy getting in there.
[157:29.14]Uh, ink.
[157:29.94]Magnet.
[157:33.14]What about, could I go into my memory bank?
[157:34.78]Alright, let's see what I can pull out my memory bank.
[157:42.01]I got, here's my certificate.
[157:44.77]In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Supreme Commander of the Elite hereby bestows on Antonio Marcos the title of First Lieutenant.
[157:55.55]Planet Earth, November 29th.
[157:59.49]Lev Kivork.
[158:02.01]Paul Lagrange.
[158:05.70]OK.
[158:12.46]Map of the Institute.
[158:14.54]Room of Final Memory.
[158:16.92]Chemical storage.
[158:18.85]Watch.
[158:19.07]The access to the room seems to be controlled by a clockwork system.
[158:22.39]Oh, wait.
[158:22.69]Didn't I give the watch to someone?
[158:27.48]Okay, well that was fun.
[158:28.92]Dee Dee's message.
[158:31.40]Let's see what Dee Dee's got to say.
[158:33.96]My oh my, you sure have left a trail of corpses in your wake.
[158:37.32]I hear La Grange got himself bumped off too.
[158:40.11]Listen to this.
[158:41.23]Both he and Marcos had their throats cut with a sharp weapon.
[158:44.71]A knife, razor blade, or scalpel by somebody left-handed.
[158:48.33]The bodies are at a certain Dr. Dromish's place.
[158:52.57]I bet the doc wanted to remove the microfilms.
[158:55.79]Marcos's funeral is this afternoon.
[158:58.45]Dr. Dromish will be there.
[159:02.37]Alright.
[159:03.07]Sounds good.
[159:04.47]What do I do about this?
[159:10.28]That closing of the door was...
[159:18.72]Like a spaceship door.
[159:20.04]Alright, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[159:21.46]I can't turn around.
[159:25.68]Stained documents.
[159:27.58]Glassham?
[159:39.15]I don't think I can even do anything to him.
[159:43.23]What is this thing?
[159:43.89]I can't touch that?
[159:51.06]Ink in sync.
[159:52.26]No, that's not what you said.
[160:04.14]That's not what you said.
[160:06.28]Use magnet on blanket.
[160:07.85]You want to play smart with me?
[160:09.09]We'll see soon about that, professor.
[160:12.21]Ink in... How many times is he going to do this to me?
[160:21.59]Ink on blanket What?
[160:23.86]That's a brand new cover
[160:32.14]I was going to have to play by their rules.
[160:34.30]This crooked cop sure wasn't going to lose any sleep over killing me.
[160:38.18]One thing was clear, though.
[160:39.70]Someone high up with influence over the police wanted me out of the way.
[160:42.66]That wouldn't even hurt you.
[160:45.06]The third man in the elite.
[160:46.48]Oh, that's new cover.
[160:47.66]Why did he turn into, like, George Bush?
[160:50.16]Yeah, that's new cover.
[160:55.50]He moved.
[160:56.08]The actor moved around.
[160:57.34]Hold on.
[161:00.44]I can't.
[161:03.02]I kind of want to see what happens if you do this.
[161:07.96]Load, I want to go back there.
[161:10.45]Okay, ink.
[161:12.87]Hey, what's going on here?
[161:13.97]Hey, that's a brand new cover.
[161:15.31]That's a brand new cover, hey.
[161:17.07]Alright.
[161:20.13]You want to walk, then let's walk.
[161:21.70]That's fine with me, now get in.
[161:23.68]I want to see the other options.
[161:24.58]Get inside, pal.
[161:26.42]And don't mess up anything in there.
[161:29.16]Oh, you see that?
[161:29.82]He gave you the answer.
[161:36.21]They don't mess up anything in there.
[161:37.73]Okay.
[161:40.41]Run away.
[161:40.77]No, that's it.
[161:42.69]I was seeing if there was anything else you could do.
[161:47.61]Oh, I love these games.
[162:02.59]I want more of these in the world.
[162:08.42]Why is there only a finite amount of these that exist?
[162:11.72]It's not fair.
[162:18.21]I was gonna have to play by their rules.
[162:20.37]This crooked cop sure wasn't gonna lose any sleep over killing me.
[162:24.24]One thing was clear, though.
[162:25.78]Someone high up with influence wanted me out of the way.
[162:28.10]Yeah, I already did it.
[162:29.24]Wait, did you guys miss five minutes ago?
[162:31.02]Not even 30 seconds ago?
[162:32.78]And I had to find out who he was fast.
[162:36.82]Alright, now Ada at the newspaper office.
[162:39.90]Okay, coffee, sugar.
[162:42.06]It's the coffee tray.
[162:43.10]Sugar, water.
[162:44.74]Wait, why am I a woman?
[162:47.70]Oh, right.
[162:48.22]Okay, boil the water.
[162:52.96]Throw in face.
[162:54.52]I think I actually have to steam a guy's face.
[163:01.98]That little cloud of steam just gave me an idea.
[163:05.50]The water's evaporated.
[163:06.82]There's nothing left in the coffee machine.
[163:08.58]Huh.
[163:13.99]Interesting.
[163:15.60]I want to look at this in 3D.
[163:24.48]Max's message to Freddy.
[163:27.25]See you soon, buddy.
[163:28.55]Hey, old buddy.
[163:29.23]Everything is just fine with me.
[163:30.97]But I'd still rather not show up at your place.
[163:34.94]Yo, I've got a new lunch hunch.
[163:37.92]Wait and see.
[163:38.60]It's great.
[163:39.73]The babe that gives you this message works for me.
[163:41.71]You don't need to worry about giving her the developed films.
[163:46.13]But keep your hands off, you old leech.
[163:49.23]See you soon, Max.
[163:51.49]Okay.
[163:53.13]So what do we got?
[163:53.67]We got mail area glue.
[163:59.84]Mail.
[164:02.54]Here's this morning's mail.
[164:05.87]What else we got here?
[164:06.93]Bubble tape.
[164:07.89]It's six feet of bubble gum.
[164:09.01]It's for not them.
[164:09.75]It's for you.
[164:10.53]This is where they put the mail.
[164:12.78]Yes, it is.
[164:15.22]Coffee area.
[164:15.76]Coffee tray.
[164:16.70]It's the coffee tray.
[164:19.32]These cups are empty.
[164:21.38]These cups are empty.
[164:24.51]Make some coffee.
[164:27.09]So I'm going to steam the mail.
[164:31.13]What, to open it without anyone knowing?
[164:34.40]I mean, that would make sense.
[164:38.72]Isn't that how you illegally do things?
[164:47.95]Alright, let's steam the mail.
[164:51.85]That's how criminals used to do things back in the 90s.
[164:53.47]Yep.
[164:58.64]You can tell this is a game that was made in 96.
[165:12.59]Unsealed envelope.
[165:15.50]3D.
[165:18.46]What?
[165:20.72]Can't touch it?
[165:23.80]Unsealed envelope on coffee.
[165:28.21]On mail area.
[165:29.53]Wait, don't I have mail?
[165:32.79]Max's message.
[165:33.71]Put it in the mail.
[165:37.39]Why would I do that?
[165:42.13]Unsealed mail in trash.
[165:48.76]Hidden message.
[165:51.12]On table.
[165:53.50]No, mail with hidden message.
[165:55.10]Well, how do I see it?
[165:57.16]Steam it?
[165:59.32]Glue on hidden message.
[166:02.00]Max's message is now hidden in the mail.
[166:05.61]Stuck message on... Table.
[166:22.24]I can pick it up though.
[166:23.02]This is where they put the mail.
[166:29.28]Stuck message on table.
[166:33.58]Okay.
[166:36.22]Glue.
[166:37.35]It's no good.
[166:38.41]I've already sealed the envelope with Max's message inside.
[166:41.39]Oh, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[166:45.59]Now we can just go into the office.
[166:47.83]Wait, I need his message.
[166:51.00]Don't I just give that to him?
[166:55.36]Save it.
[167:10.35]Just in case.
[167:15.92]Oh, no.
[167:17.00]A cop's questioning Freddy about Marcus's murder.
[167:20.63]It looks like he's about to search the office from top to bottom.
[167:24.11]My God, what shall I do?
[167:25.37]Uh... That's the inspector's raincoat.
[167:30.58]Pull him to the ground.
[167:33.08]Box of paperclips.
[167:33.70]A box of paperclips.
[167:35.90]Nothing amazing, but it could be useful.
[167:39.28]Uh, we got... Uh-oh.
[167:43.33]That guy didn't say anything.
[167:45.13]Did he blow a kiss?
[167:51.55]A box of paper clips.
[167:53.83]Nothing amazing, but it could be useful.
[167:56.55]Use... Use glue on his eyes.
[168:00.85]Uh, box of paper clips.
[168:03.89]Uh, Freddy.
[168:04.83]Freddy.
[168:05.47]Ada introduced herself to my newspaper buddy as the new temp.
[168:08.73]Perplexed, Freddy waited for her to make the first move.
[168:12.77]Okay, what about Inspector Van Dale?
[168:14.01]If I don't make Freddy understand soon, the cop is gonna get suspicious.
[168:22.66]That's the inspector's raincoat.
[168:25.90]A box of paper clips.
[168:28.18]Nothing amazing, but it could be useful.
[168:30.56]See, I gotta bring him the damn nail.
[168:32.08]There's no going back.
[168:33.86]I've got to face this.
[168:37.36]How can I let Freddy know who
[168:43.95]The inspector began to feel there was something odd about this jumpy young lady.
[168:47.60]The sleazeball decided to frisk her and on the way discovered she was not accomplished.
[168:54.56]Okay, so I have to try that again.
[168:58.80]Remember, I told you I might have fucked it up.
[169:00.80]Load might have fucked it up.
[169:02.54]$50.
[169:05.70]You gave a lot of money.
[169:08.80]$50 from Stormichu.
[169:12.12]Thank you so much, Stormichu.
[169:15.09]For the $5,00050.
[169:19.79]Thank you.
[169:21.95]Just got to remind you and everyone in chat that you're the best streamer around town.
[169:26.37]Have a comfy night, chat.
[169:28.35]Now.
[169:30.71]Thank you, Stormy Chu.
[169:33.79]That's a very, very nice thing to say.
[169:36.99]And a very, very large amount of money to give somebody.
[169:39.01]Thank you.
[169:40.39]Much love to you, man.
[169:43.39]I'm feeling pretty comfy today.
[169:45.89]I'm comfy.
[169:47.99]So I got the message.
[169:49.48]Let's go be comfy.
[169:53.82]Look at the use of that new emote I see over there.
[169:55.96]A cop's questioning Freddy about Marcus' murder.
[169:59.40]It looks like he's about to search the office from top to bottom.
[170:02.86]My God, what shall I do?
[170:05.16]Alright, let's get over there.
[170:05.98]Here's the mail.
[170:07.22]Doesn't it have glue all over it?
[170:08.62]Okay, here you go.
[170:09.04]Stuck message.
[170:09.50]Give it to you.
[170:09.82]Freddy!
[170:09.96]Freddy!
[170:10.12]Freddy!
[170:34.90]Let me see those.
[170:36.28]Freddy?
[170:37.82]Freddy?
[170:39.70]Boo!
[170:41.50]Boo!
[170:43.44]Somebody will get it.
[170:48.76]I would do that really loud, but I can't.
[170:50.50]It'll actually hear it.
[170:51.36]He sure knew how to turn that sleazeball on.
[170:55.02]This gave Freddy all the time he needed to find my message.
[170:58.36]He pointed out a green file to Ada in which my developed photos were hidden.
[171:03.92]Oh, my God.
[171:05.50]All she had to do now was get them out of the office.
[171:07.56]And it's open.
[171:09.15]I wonder what the inspector was looking for something.
[171:12.29]Why don't you show it to him, too?
[171:15.31]No, that's not suspicious at all.
[171:19.91]Okay, now... Right.
[171:23.53]Freddy seemed to appreciate the way I kept the inspector busy earlier.
[171:28.20]Now I need to find another way.
[171:30.20]I need to find another way.
[171:31.78]Oops, sorry.
[171:33.00]While the inspector's intention was distracted by Ada's plunging neckline as she picked up the paperclip she'd spilled, Freddy boldly slipped the contents of the green file into the pocket of the inspector's raincoat.
[171:46.26]Okay, well that was fun.
[171:47.66]He didn't notice what Freddy was up to.
[171:50.38]He has no idea the photos I came to get are in his own raincoat.
[171:56.03]That's true, would you look at that.
[171:57.73]How?
[171:57.81]Why is he doing that?
[171:58.25]Freddie, why did you do that?
[171:58.93]What?
[171:59.17]Okay, I'll go make some coffee.
[172:19.52]coffee time okay so I heard you guys like coffee with this or just use it to boil some water I can't go and make more coffee their cups are already full oh it's been sitting here okay I already made it it's just in there for like at least 30 minutes that's old coffee alright tray on coffee tray on mail area tray on door
[172:49.44]Trey on Inspector.
[172:50.64]What?
[172:51.78]What?
[172:51.90]What are you talking about?
[172:53.02]I just went to go get the coffee.
[173:16.95]I can't go into the office if Freddy doesn't know Max sent me.
[173:20.09]Oh, shit.
[173:20.83]I gotta do the whole fucking thing over again.
[173:22.39]Oh, god damn it.
[173:24.29]It's alright.
[173:24.67]I gotta... You fucked it up.
[173:29.38]You fucked it up again.
[173:33.00]Okay.
[173:33.22]Let's do it again.
[173:44.93]Oh no.
[173:45.71]There he is.
[173:46.21]A cop's questioning Freddy about Marcus's murder.
[173:48.41]Put coffee on the coat.
[173:49.47]I could do that.
[173:49.81]It looks like he's about to search the office from top to bottom.
[173:53.11]My cut!
[173:53.71]What shall I do?
[173:54.37]Okay.
[173:55.95]Stuck message.
[173:56.73]Give it to him.
[173:57.23]Hello, it's your secretary here with a fucking delivery.
[174:00.43]Ada calmly handed Freddy the mail where she'd hid my message.
[174:03.03]I'm gonna save more often.
[174:03.77]The inspector glanced at the pile just to check that all the omelettes were sealed.
[174:07.45]Freddy!
[174:07.65]Come on, Freddy!
[174:08.41]Then turned his attention on my gorgeous accomplices every move.
[174:15.26]Come on, pig!
[174:18.32]Where's he off to?
[174:20.22]Freddy?
[174:22.20]Freddy!
[174:23.22]Fred!
[174:29.27]She sure knew how to turn that sleazeball on.
[174:32.61]This gave Freddy all the time he needed to find my message.
[174:35.29]Yep.
[174:35.95]He pointed out a green file to AF.
[174:37.74]This is sexual?
[174:38.32]I mean, it's... In which my developed photos were hidden.
[174:40.10]That's not sexual.
[174:40.62]It's suggestive.
[174:41.74]There's a little bit of a small difference.
[174:43.10]All she had to do now was get them out of the office.
[174:45.52]This is suggestive content.
[174:50.31]Alright, dumped it.
[174:52.27]Sorry.
[174:53.01]Moving fast while the inspector's intention was distracted by Ada's plunging neckline as she picked up the paper clip she'd spilled, Freddy boldly slipped the contents of the green file into the pocket of the inspector's raincoat.
[175:05.63]Okay, now let's save it.
[175:07.88]Management.
[175:08.92]Save.
[175:09.76]Labyrinth.
[175:11.00]Got it.
[175:11.52]Okay.
[175:12.54]Go get coffee.
[175:14.30]Freddy asked Ada to go make some coffee.
[175:16.62]He figured out how Ada could get the photos out of the inspector's raincoat.
[175:21.30]Alright, go get the coffee.
[175:22.32]There it is.
[175:23.64]Okay, coffee.
[175:27.38]Cups.
[175:32.10]Let's try to dump this on the coat.
[175:33.96]And it'll ruin the coat.
[175:36.60]And that gives us an opportunity to get out of there.
[175:40.22]Here you are.
[175:41.06]Raincoat.
[175:41.70]Bingo.
[175:41.90]And he arrested her.
[175:50.23]Ada pretended to take the raincoat out of the office to clean it.
[175:56.63]What has this accomplished, by the way?
[175:59.23]Why couldn't I have just left the message on the table?
[176:02.12]She took the photos and stole a visiting card and some of the caramels the cops... And she decided to eat a few of them.
[176:15.18]She really likes candy, too.
[176:16.50]We had both come up against Inspector Vandale and had managed to outsmart him.
[176:20.99]This time, though, Ada outdid herself.
[176:23.71]She had that sleazeball Vandale sewed up in no time.
[176:27.19]I had to take my hat off to her.
[176:29.36]She's gonna show you the grilled cheese.
[176:31.53]I love that grilled cheese sandwich.
[176:32.89]I'm sorry, he's talking.
[176:33.83]Okay.
[176:33.95]I guess this doesn't matter.
[176:56.66]So these both happen regardless, so... We're going to the cemetery?
[177:01.98]It doesn't matter.
[177:02.96]We'd have to do them both anyway.
[177:06.56]So I'm going to go like this.
[177:13.15]Back to the cemetery.
[177:19.07]61%.
[177:19.11]We're getting to the end.
[177:20.33]What is this?
[177:22.51]Ada, wait.
[177:23.31]I have to switch between the two.
[177:25.75]Oh, my God.
[177:26.19]What?
[177:26.37]This is not the time limit?
[177:28.18]What do I have to do?
[177:29.28]Oh, my God.
[177:29.98]Uh, to the road.
[177:30.64]To the service.
[177:31.02]Okay, let's go to the funeral.
[177:52.56]A lady.
[177:53.14]A lady.
[177:53.72]A lady.
[177:54.34]The priest.
[177:54.74]He's officiating.
[177:57.56]Dignified and cold as ice.
[177:58.98]Nobody wants a drink?
[178:05.77]Okay.
[178:06.01]What about lady?
[178:07.43]She looks sad.
[178:10.37]Lady.
[178:11.11]What's hidden behind those dark glasses?
[178:15.91]Paul's stained document.
[178:21.25]Whiskey.
[178:22.05]For the driver.
[178:23.73]That seems like a really bad idea.
[178:31.64]Really?
[178:33.00]It only took a drop of whiskey to get Mrs. Marcos' driver to talk.
[178:36.99]He told me that a private service was taking place.
[178:39.35]Ah, that's not a good idea.
[178:40.15]Only that C's wife and sister and a certain lady doctor were in attendance.
[178:47.59]What?
[178:50.63]I swear to God, every time I see somebody drink whiskey on camera, I want some.
[178:56.41]Wait, what?
[178:59.47]Why is he giving me the Ferris Bueller's Day Off, like, winky face thing?
[179:02.87]He's worried I'm gonna get him into trouble.
[179:11.30]No, stop giving this guy alcohol!
[179:18.11]I gather from what he's saying that the infamous Dr. Dramish is a woman.
[179:23.15]He's got to give me more info.
[179:25.15]There's three women over there.
[179:39.62]I gather from what he's saying that the infamous Dr. Dramish is a woman.
[179:42.58]That's all he's going to give me.
[179:43.38]Alright.
[179:43.76]Don't you fucking call a cab, dickhead.
[179:50.47]There she is.
[179:52.05]That's the infamous Dr. Dramish.
[179:54.75]I wonder if she's the Marcos family doctor.
[180:02.93]That's the infamous Dr. Dramish.
[180:04.17]What do I do about this?
[180:05.64]I wonder if she's the Marcos family doctor.
[180:09.66]Okay.
[180:12.66]The service will be over soon.
[180:14.76]What's the goal here?
[180:23.63]Use magnet on the body.
[180:25.13]To the road.
[180:31.19]Uh... A standard model.
[180:35.91]A regular car.
[180:37.65]There's nothing unusual about the car.
[180:39.45]Why am I out in the middle of the road?
[180:49.48]Oh.
[180:54.72]damn I couldn't do anything ada's gonna get caught okay well that's okay try again so we got whiskey to the chauffeur tell me everything you know about the person we gotta with the middle car
[181:22.15]It only took a drop of whiskey to get Mrs. Marcos' driver to talk.
[181:26.14]He told me that a private service was taking place.
[181:29.04]Only the deceased's wife and sister and a certain lady doctor were in attendance.
[181:33.30]Okay.
[181:35.06]And give me the names of who that is.
[181:36.66]Thank you.
[181:40.40]One more.
[181:40.76]That'll do it.
[181:46.99]I don't have the music on.
[181:50.37]Swap characters.
[181:50.97]Alright, I'm going to swap characters after this.
[181:52.43]I gather from what he's saying that the infamous Dr. Dramish is a woman.
[181:55.81]Okay, well, that's fine.
[181:56.69]Alright, let's switch characters.
[181:59.82]We got, alright, stick, mailbox, gate, stick.
[182:05.08]It's a wooden stick.
[182:07.10]Stick on the garden.
[182:10.54]Gate, gate.
[182:11.44]Closed, of course.
[182:13.36]Mailbox.

[182:14.82]It must have come today.
[182:18.98]Uh, business stick.

[182:54.65]Doctor whatever is a woman.
[182:57.37]I can't.
[182:58.13]I'll read it, then put it back.
[183:03.93]I can't fucking hear this shit.
[183:05.23]Okay, where is it?
[183:07.97]Photos.
[183:09.59]Tony Marcos.
[183:10.47]Paul LaGrange.
[183:13.71]No.
[183:14.45]You dummy.
[183:15.59]No.
[183:16.09]What are you doing?
[183:17.67]Photos.
[183:20.51]Tony Marcos and Paul LaCrange.
[183:25.44]Is this it?
[183:30.16]Insurance letter.
[183:32.32]It's a letter from the Dear Doctors Insurance Company.
[183:36.19]Let's see if the house is burglar proof.
[183:40.58]okay let's see angels filmed by the three cameras in your garden do not cover the whole surface it would thus be possible for someone to slip in unaware by the servants entrance due to the blind spots created by insufficient camera surveillance servants entrance servants entrance
[184:03.85]In addition, your laboratory audiophonic central locking system, while very original, is unfortunately not reliable.
[184:11.06]Indeed, Mr. Pietro noted that a magpie currently nesting in your garden sings exactly the same identification tune.
[184:19.87]And after examination by your agent, Mr. Curious was protected for property.
[184:24.56]Certain number of latent defects would appear to impede an insurance agreement between yourself and the company.
[184:29.82]So the bird sings the correct tune and go through the servant's entrance.
[184:35.14]You got it.
[184:36.02]Zoom out.
[184:36.56]Get it back in there.
[184:38.84]Okay.
[184:39.56]I've memorized the contents of the letter.
[184:43.09]Alright.
[184:46.45]Servant's entrance to the garden.
[184:48.87]It isn't very high.
[184:50.65]Easy enough for a young woman to climb.
[184:52.53]Okay, we got back door.
[184:56.19]The insurance letter mentioned three cameras, but I can't see any of them.
[185:00.33]I have to find them so I can use the blind spots to get closer.
[185:06.10]This is a hidden object game.
[185:07.40]Binoculars hanging from branch.
[185:09.28]Okay.
[185:10.52]Let's see if there are any hidden traps.
[185:13.10]Oh, what the fuck?
[185:16.22]Brick pile.
[185:16.76]Is there a trap in there?
[185:25.01]This... I can't tell.
[185:32.16]Maybe I should check it out.
[185:34.91]A magpie's nest.
[185:36.06]I'm almost out of time.
[185:39.50]These binoculars are terrible.
[185:41.18]If I just took the binoculars off, it wouldn't be blurry.
[185:43.92]Oh my god.
[185:47.11]There's a camera.
[185:48.03]Camera there.
[186:02.46]Damn, I couldn't do anything.
[186:04.12]Ada's gonna get caught.
[186:06.49]Alright, so his story is very easy.
[186:09.79]I don't have to do anything.
[186:11.63]I have to do... I have to distract her?
[186:15.83]Alright, let's get... I'm already losing a shitload of time.
[186:22.46]What the fuck?
[186:25.82]He's officiating.
[186:52.40]Okay, there's Dr. Dramish.
[186:54.70]That's Dr. Dramish.
[186:55.76]Okay, now I know what kind of car she drives.
[187:00.70]Back it up.
[187:02.28]All the way out to the road, the exit.
[187:05.88]A regular car.
[187:06.81]Here's the car.
[187:08.79]Uh, key her car.
[187:12.41]Paul's key ring.
[187:14.09]Uh, magnet on the car.
[187:19.01]Uh, whiskey on the car.
[187:22.26]Uh, stained document on the car.
[187:33.83]The service will be over soon.
[187:38.11]Does she know her husband was cheating on her in room 225 of the Buena Vista Hotel?
[187:42.37]How am I supposed to determine that's her car, though?
[187:46.26]It looks like only the closest family member showed up.
[187:50.50]It looks like only the closest family members showed up.
[187:52.96]Broke back in the face.
[187:55.34]That's the infamous Dr. Drummage.
[187:58.06]I wonder if she's the Marcos family doctor.
[188:01.15]She's only got one glove on.
[188:03.39]Only got one glove.
[188:06.84]So?
[188:07.02]She's only got one glove on.
[188:22.65]She's only got one glove.
[188:23.61]Is that it?
[188:25.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[188:26.31]Hold on.
[188:26.97]Can I look at the other?
[188:29.79]I think I can see something on the seat.
[188:32.61]Glove.
[188:32.91]Okay, glove.
[188:33.31]Dr. Drum, she's got a glove.
[188:34.77]Smash.
[188:35.25]This is definitely her car, then.
[188:36.82]Smash.
[188:37.56]Now I need to put it out of action.
[188:39.44]Smash.
[188:41.30]It's too late.
[188:41.94]Alright, I get it.
[188:46.54]Damn, I couldn't do anything.
[188:48.20]Eve is going to get caught.
[188:51.55]I wish she backed up into that other car.
[188:53.39]That'd be fun.
[188:54.97]Alright, so we gotta... I can get this part done pretty quickly now.
[189:00.93]Again, here we go.
[189:02.47]This is draining every time faster, by the way.
[189:10.60]Raise the volume.
[189:11.30]What you meant to say was kill the background sound and turn the game sound off.
[189:16.28]Because that's the problem.
[189:18.49]I get the point of saying that the infamous Dr. Dramish is a woman.
[189:22.19]Yeah, so... There.
[189:24.93]There you go.
[189:25.67]Now we can actually hear.
[189:26.90]So there's Dramish.
[189:28.02]Click on the glove.
[189:28.92]That's Dr. Dramish.
[189:30.68]So she's the one who did the autopsies on Lagrange and Marcos.
[189:34.70]She's only got one glove on.
[189:36.86]Go to the car.
[189:40.64]I think I can see something on the seat.
[189:43.66]Dr. Dramish's other glove.
[189:45.00]Fuck up this car.
[189:45.94]This is definitely her car then.
[189:48.07]Now I need to put it out of action.
[189:49.81]Now how do I do that?
[189:51.49]Go back.
[189:53.23]I'm going to do Dr. Dramish a little disservice.
[189:56.99]Front wheel.
[189:57.25]I can't see the valve.
[189:59.45]I'm going to do Dr. Dramish a little disservice.
[190:04.62]Pop the tire.
[190:08.28]Good.
[190:08.92]She won't get far like that.
[190:11.47]Front wheel, back wheel, really fuck it all up.
[190:14.35]Front wheel, valve, tailgate.
[190:17.77]Put a magnet in the tailgate.
[190:21.43]Whiskey in the tailgate.
[190:25.01]Whiskey in the gas tank.
[190:27.54]Whiskey on the lock.
[190:29.76]Magnet on the lock.
[190:34.88]Front wheel.
[190:35.28]Can't see the valve.
[190:42.70]There's no valve on this one.
[190:45.60]I can't hear anything else.
[190:57.75]Let's see what happens.
[191:04.98]I'm curious.
[191:08.15]Eat the lettuce.
[191:09.95]Great, it worked.
[191:11.29]The doctor won't be using her car.
[191:14.89]Okay.
[191:19.44]Oh, my God.
[191:20.72]Click over... No, dude, hold on.
[191:25.44]Oh, for the love of God.
[191:26.34]It's a wooden stick.
[191:28.56]So that just resets.
[191:31.55]Look at how much faster this is going.
[191:33.99]This is going so fast.
[191:39.64]Can I attack somebody?
[191:41.84]I'm gonna punch her.
[191:43.78]I'm gonna throw something at her.
[191:49.17]It's a letter from an insurance company.
[191:52.13]I'll read it, then put it back.
[191:54.19]You're gonna have to wait.
[192:01.21]What?
[192:05.03]What just happened to the... He's worried I'm gonna get him into trouble.
[192:08.93]Oh, I broke the game.
[192:16.63]No, what?
[192:17.64]Oh, come on.
[192:19.46]Alright, it's OK.
[192:19.88]It's OK.
[192:22.06]I got to read that.
[192:22.54]No, that's the wrong thing.
[192:26.80]Delivery sheet.
[192:27.54]Where is it?
[192:27.94]Insurance letter.
[192:30.39]It's a letter from the dear doctor's insurance company.
[192:34.23]Let's see if the house is burglar-proof.
[192:36.87]I think I can break this game, by the way.
[192:38.39]Every time I need time, I'm going to go back and click on the chauffeur.
[192:41.61]Alright.
[192:42.19]Three things.
[192:43.09]Servant's entrance and the sounds of the birds.
[192:45.83]You got it.
[192:48.09]I got to test my theory here in a second.
[192:49.91]Okay.
[192:50.63]I've memorized the contents of the letter.
[192:53.75]Nothing else here.
[192:54.47]To the garden, to the garden, to the garden, to the garden, to the garden.
[192:58.41]It isn't very high.
[193:00.19]Easy enough for a young woman to climb.
[193:02.07]Got the binoculars.
[193:05.71]Let's be slow.
[193:06.61]Let's see if there are any hidden traps.
[193:08.53]There's a back?
[193:08.93]What do you mean there's a back?
[193:13.30]Fuck.
[193:15.92]It's alright.
[193:16.20]I have infinite time.
[193:16.86]Don't worry.
[193:17.44]Okay.
[193:18.18]I've memorized the contents of the letters.
[193:28.77]Zoom in.
[193:30.55]Furthermore, the electric security system of your laboratory equipment can be too easily short-circuited.
[193:35.73]We're sure that you appreciate in the circumstances how difficult it is for our company to ensure you.
[193:40.60]We remain nonetheless totally available should you wish to consult us on how to improve.
[193:45.08]By Patrick Robin.
[193:48.14]Okay.
[193:48.86]Okay.
[193:49.58]I've memorized the contents of the letter.
[193:52.18]Let me test my theory.
[194:01.71]He's worried I'm gonna get him into trouble.
[194:03.65]God damn it.
[194:11.71]You won't be able to drive.
[194:14.05]Come on.
[194:17.81]I gather from what he's saying that the infamous Dr. Dramish is a woman.
[194:27.12]Can't see the valve.
[194:27.98]There's gotta be something else I can do to this shit.
[194:38.34]What do I do?
[194:42.61]Tailgate.
[194:43.85]No, I can't.
[194:45.45]Police ID the tailgate?
[194:49.01]What do you got in here?
[194:53.73]Glove.
[194:54.05]She left the right-hand glove in her car.
[194:56.75]That's logical for someone who's left-handed.
[194:58.77]Can I smash something?
[195:00.55]A music score.
[195:01.71]Is Dr. Dramish a musician?
[195:02.99]Okay, but rip something up.
[195:09.84]I can't, like, pour whiskey all over the seat.
[195:14.00]Magnet on dash.
[195:15.98]There's nothing I can do.
[195:18.78]What is this?
[195:19.32]Score.
[195:23.19]What the fuck?
[195:23.97]The first eight notes?
[195:25.09]The hymn to joy?
[195:26.05]What the hell is this?
[195:28.47]Alright, it's gonna be you have to play a piano eventually here.
[195:32.03]Ink on glove.
[195:32.83]I don't have any ink.
[195:39.59]Locked, of course.
[195:41.91]It's a code.
[195:45.73]I'm fucked.
[195:49.99]Can't see the valve.
[195:52.93]I can't move over to the front of the car?
[196:00.00]Flask.
[196:00.56]Heart medicine.
[196:02.02]They can be dangerous if the dose is too strong.
[196:04.90]Heart medicine on glove.
[196:06.24]Heart medicine on her.
[196:12.40]She looks like she's waiting.
[196:16.92]Oh, oh, oh!
[196:19.08]The guy, heart medicine in the whiskey.
[196:21.06]Heart medicine in whiskey.
[196:22.00]Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[196:26.95]No!
[196:33.33]No!
[196:34.07]He's worried I'm going to get him into trouble.
[196:38.01]Oh!
[196:49.64]I'm going to get one more bar for this.
[196:54.22]There you go.
[196:55.88]Ease out of the way.
[197:01.28]What?
[197:03.00]Ease out of it.
[197:08.35]I'm getting negative here.
[197:10.37]Negative time.
[197:18.49]What is happening?
[197:22.70]This is all fucked up.
[197:23.56]That's fine.
[197:24.84]Okay, I need the binoculars.
[197:26.52]Okay, we gotta find the three cameras.
[197:27.88]Look for glints.
[197:28.82]Tell me if you see one.
[197:39.59]Looking for glints.
[197:47.39]Magpie's nest.
[197:54.71]Empty pot, nothing in there.
[197:56.71]Brick pile, nothing in there.
[198:07.97]Yeah, you see any glints?
[198:11.13]I saw, wait, glint.
[198:12.85]Ah, there's the first camera.
[198:15.83]There should be two more.
[198:17.80]Okay.
[198:22.50]Right next to it, there was one over the window.
[198:25.69]Nothing in the window.
[198:26.31]Looking for Glint.
[198:29.31]Don't see any.
[198:32.69]Camera in the flowers.
[198:33.57]No.
[198:40.86]Thank God I broke the game and have infinite time.
[198:43.82]There's the second one.
[198:45.96]Only one more.
[198:49.94]I've already spotted that one.
[198:51.78]Turkey in window.
[198:56.21]Maybe I should check it out.
[198:59.51]That's one right there, isn't it?
[199:07.84]Here's the third one.
[199:09.72]That's all of them.
[199:11.47]Okay.
[199:16.15]I need to save this game.
[199:24.91]Okay.
[199:26.13]Where's that nest?
[199:27.33]I can see a magpie's nest.
[199:30.25]I wonder if they really are thieves.
[199:34.35]Caramel in the magpie.
[199:36.09]No.
[199:37.13]Back door.
[199:37.95]Thanks to the insurance letter, I know where the three cameras are.
[199:41.86]Now I can get closer without setting off the alarm.
[199:45.26]Okay.
[199:47.60]So I need to get the magpie nest, don't I?
[199:53.91]I think I need this on.
[199:56.36]I need to deal with this for a minute, because I think I need to know the sounds in the bird.
[200:02.16]I need a bit of time, it's so wonderful.
[200:07.79]Walk.
[200:10.95]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[200:14.99]Caramel is on the walk.
[200:28.72]Birds are too loud.
[200:30.44]To the gate.
[200:31.08]To the garden.
[200:32.12]I can't go into the gate.
[200:36.59]So what am I missing here, then?
[200:37.89]Locked, of course.
[200:38.65]Business card unlocked.
[201:00.75]I can't take it.
[201:01.27]I have to turn it off.
[201:03.65]What is it?
[201:03.95]What is this?
[201:05.17]Why can't I do anything?
[201:08.45]Ada, read the insurance letter again.
[201:11.05]The audio code is a melody.
[201:12.85]You can hear one of the magpies in the garden whistling the first eight notes of it.
[201:16.66]If you have a musical ear, you can try to remember it.
[201:19.30]Otherwise, you can find the score in Dr. Dramish's car.
[201:22.34]Using this score, you can deduce the code from the notes.
[201:26.02]What code?
[201:28.22]There's no code?
[201:30.34]Locked, of course.
[201:34.83]I don't understand.
[201:37.13]Where do I punch the code in?
[201:48.54]Brick pile?
[201:57.52]That's a pile of bricks, man.
[202:01.04]I have to chirp it in real life.
[202:10.57]Click the nest and memorize the sounds.
[202:15.67]Okay, I didn't... Okay.
[202:22.03]I thought I... I thought I tried to do that before and it didn't work.
[202:24.89]Let's go...
[202:31.96]Easy.
[202:32.82]The old key trick.
[202:35.28]Right.
[202:36.58]Here's the door to the devious... This is where they're keeping Jerry Garcia.
[202:49.51]I don't suppose these glasses were lying around by chance.
[202:53.61]The old use a key to open the door trick.
[202:56.75]Alright.
[202:57.19]Rubbish bin.
[202:58.31]What is rubbish?
[203:01.63]Bills, bills.
[203:03.60]She smelt it.
[203:04.26]Why is she smelling them?
[203:08.18]These sheets look like plans for an electronic cart.
[203:11.96]Let's keep them just in case.
[203:13.90]I can't put the mask on, guys.
[203:18.47]The audio code.
[203:19.37]That's strange.
[203:29.22]The keys aren't numbered or letters.
[203:32.52]I can't do it.
[204:00.47]This door doesn't have any locks or keyholes.
[204:06.59]Give me the home.
[204:07.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[204:11.60]Where's the, um... I want to 3D print this.
[204:13.68]If I fit all the pieces together, I'll have a schema for the electronic card.
[204:17.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[204:20.04]Hold on.
[204:26.42]That was a guy.
[204:28.02]That was not her talking.
[204:29.50]I got to put the puzzle together.
[204:31.78]Oh, shit.
[204:32.58]Okay.
[204:38.90]Well, see you in like 45 minutes.
[204:45.39]Data card.
[204:46.39]Data card.
[204:47.01]That goes over here.
[204:50.39]Maybe like this.
[204:53.15]Hold on.
[204:53.73]I just got to get it right.
[204:57.54]Actually, the mouse doesn't show up on the screen.
[204:59.06]That makes this even more difficult to accomplish.
[205:00.88]Okay, so then this comes over here.
[205:02.48]Oh, the mouse doesn't show up.
[205:05.72]That sucks.
[205:09.98]Oh, that makes it so much harder.
[205:11.60]Alright.
[205:15.17]Oh, I need that.
[205:15.97]This is down here.
[205:27.89]I just want to go over here.
[205:34.41]Red is the border?
[205:35.39]What are you talking about?
[205:43.12]Let's go out to the movies.
[205:45.54]Let's go out to the movies.
[205:48.04]Let's go out to the movies and have ourselves a snack.
[205:53.32]Hey, some of you guys are fucking smart in here.
[206:07.39]No, it just goes this way.
[206:09.76]Where's the last bottom one?
[206:11.56]It's over there.
[206:18.24]Red is border.
[206:20.72]Stupid.
[206:21.32]Stupid.
[206:21.96]Stupid.
[206:22.64]Stupid.
[206:23.32]Dumb.
[206:26.07]This guy's dumb.
[206:27.39]This guy's dumb.
[206:30.67]Chat, this guy might be dumb.
[206:40.65]Just get them all in the right place here.
[206:42.21]Hold on.
[206:42.63]I know they're wrong, but just wait.
[206:46.21]I know they're wrong.
[206:49.49]Okay, now that I got the borders.
[206:53.72]Excuse me.
[206:55.20]Game just crashed.
[206:56.62]No, it didn't.
[206:57.94]Yeah, it didn't.
[206:59.60]No, it didn't.
[207:02.41]Okay, now I just gotta put the middle together.
[207:07.18]Is that?
[207:07.58]I don't understand.
[207:08.60]Is that the red?
[207:09.12]There's no red.
[207:09.82]Where's the border for that one?
[207:14.21]Come on, man.
[207:15.01]Give me a break.
[207:19.39]We're going to start from the top left.
[207:20.59]I need, what do I need here?
[207:27.89]Top right here.
[207:30.33]So that doesn't make any sense.
[207:32.37]So where's the border for this one?
[207:39.43]Get it Frick man So now I need this one goes here this one goes here That's not correct, but I'm just trying to this puzzle is fucked up Now this none of this goes here I need to get this left side here that goes there okay to give me the red one I
[208:07.39]Then got to go top to bottom.
[208:10.27]This is not going to work if you don't do it like that.
[208:11.93]OK, so I need this one.
[208:17.29]I'm just going to put this fucking wherever.
[208:18.73]I need the bottom right portion of that, which is here.
[208:24.55]Blue goes here.
[208:25.37]Alright, we're getting there, getting there, getting there, getting there.
[208:27.24]Almost there.
[208:28.76]Chill out.
[208:29.40]Calm down.
[208:31.08]Chill.
[208:32.66]Chill.
[208:34.98]Circle goes there.
[208:37.79]It's the other part of the circle.
[208:46.46]I wish I could see my fucking mouse.
[208:50.58]Where's this bottom left portion of the circle?
[208:54.42]There it is.
[208:57.79]What am I missing here?
[209:01.53]This goes.
[209:03.27]This is not correct.
[209:09.58]Neither is that.
[209:10.56]And neither is that.
[209:12.76]That's correct.
[209:14.50]Fuck!
[209:15.10]This is... This is like all over the place.
[209:22.37]What have I done wrong?
[209:27.73]This needs... Is this the border?
[209:30.81]This is the border.
[209:34.05]No.
[209:34.69]No.
[209:35.59]Do you see what I'm talking about here?
[209:49.64]Not having my mouse is driving me insane.
[210:00.02]Yeah, the border is the red, but like, do you see how some of them have red as well?
[210:06.48]Give me my fucking mouse!
[210:13.85]Oh my fucking god.
[210:15.73]Why is my mouse not here?
[210:32.96]This is making it so much fucking hard around me.
[210:35.98]I have to guess where my fucking mouse is.
[210:41.76]Alright, hold on.
[210:43.84]So this one needs to go.
[210:50.70]Is there a- Oh my fucking god.
[210:53.28]Give me a break.
[211:03.63]I lost my mouse again.
[211:05.39]I need to always keep a piece in my hand.
[211:16.14]You understand?
[211:18.11]I always have to keep a peace, no matter what the case is, always.
[211:34.94]I need a brain?
[211:35.66]No, I need a functioning video game.
[211:47.64]Just get the borders correct again.
[211:49.35]Give me a fucking break, man.
[211:54.65]I know it's all wrong.
[211:55.51]I'm gonna fix it, don't worry.
[211:56.97]I can't fucking believe this shit.
[212:02.77]Don't ever hit right click accidentally.
[212:05.27]Or you'll lose the whole fucking puzzle.
[212:08.17]Fucking puzzle games, man.
[212:12.79]Oops, there we go.
[212:13.85]Sorry, sorry, you don't have a mouse!
[212:15.33]Sorry, you don't have a mouse anymore!
[212:22.38]My god Okay Before I lose my fucking mind Keep a piece in my hand at all times gonna start at the fucking top left So, let's go ahead and start at the top
[212:51.59]That's not correct.
[212:53.01]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[212:56.63]So this is not right.
[213:00.23]Put this up here.
[213:05.00]Where am I?
[213:05.36]I'm going to slowly go like this.
[213:14.22]You wouldn't believe how annoying this is.
[213:17.19]have to do this like this without having my mouse I'm going to complain about it until the stream ends because once I do a correct piece I have to guess again this is correct uh I need this piece that's not the right piece oh my god why game
[213:52.97]Where's the green?
[214:06.16]I need to just do the left side.
[214:07.62]The left side is not, is the left side done?
[214:10.32]Like this piece here doesn't look like it fits here.
[214:14.08]But it does.
[214:15.46]This thing is complete.
[214:20.02]It is correct.
[214:20.74]It just doesn't look like it is.
[214:27.29]Alright, now give me the stupid fucking bottom of this.
[214:29.96]Wherever it is.
[214:34.34]Okay, I need the pencil.
[214:36.76]Where's the pencil?
[214:37.82]There it is.
[214:38.24]Okay.
[214:43.34]Now, I almost right clicked and I would have put my hand through my monitor.
[214:46.45]Alright, now you're going to get this piece here.
[214:51.03]Okay, great.
[214:51.73]This is fucking fun.
[214:54.75]Having a great time.
[214:58.22]I need the end of the corner of that one.
[215:01.06]It's not correct.
[215:01.86]It's right here.
[215:04.82]Blue goes up here.
[215:12.71]Sure.
[215:14.43]That's not where that goes.
[215:23.72]OK.
[215:24.20]Now, this doesn't look right.
[215:27.63]It's not.
[215:35.92]I hate not having the mouse.
[216:07.69]Okay, got it Oh
[216:39.26]I've pieced together the card's schema at last.
[216:48.57]I was playing in the dark.
[216:53.41]Okay.
[216:56.94]I was in the dark.
[217:00.08]I was just trying.
[217:00.98]Okay.
[217:01.84]Oh, hey, Jeremy, do this puzzle.
[217:03.46]I brought a jigsaw puzzle over.
[217:04.94]Oh, nice.
[217:05.56]Cool.
[217:06.40]Oh, by the way, turn around.
[217:07.32]I'm going to handcuff your hands behind your back.
[217:09.72]And I'm going to turn the lights off.
[217:13.02]Why would you turn the lights off?
[217:14.16]I can't see where my hands are and where the pieces are.
[217:16.48]Yeah, do it, idiot.
[217:18.95]Okay.
[217:28.43]I can't save.
[217:33.86]You broke it.
[217:34.42]No, no.
[217:36.64]Hold on.
[217:37.06]You're telling me that this was going to be timed?
[217:41.09]No way.
[217:42.95]That was going to be timed.
[217:46.93]Holy shit.
[217:47.59]I'm so glad it broke.
[217:49.03]This door doesn't have any locks or keyholes.
[217:52.24]Okay, so I need to make a key.
[217:54.88]I got the card schematic on the door.
[217:57.34]On the audio code.
[217:58.46]On the door.
[217:59.60]In the trash.
[217:59.94]There's no time to throw things out.
[218:02.02]Only to find them.
[218:03.61]Okay, now I need to do this audio shenanigans.
[218:07.81]Rubbish bin to the garden.
[218:09.93]I need to do this music thing with the bird.
[218:12.40]Turn the music on.
[218:13.24]That's the...
[218:33.86]but I can't, there's no sounds.
[218:52.89]Wait, what?
[218:53.55]I need to put on my glasses?
[218:55.49]Oh my God.
[218:56.05]That's not how it works.
[218:58.14]Okay, hold on, ready?
[219:07.39]So it's dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[219:11.20]So E, E. E, E, E, E, E, F. E, E, F, G.
[219:54.03]How am I this stupid?
[219:55.13]I'm just trying to hear the song.
[219:57.09]I actually didn't know that.
[219:58.21]Rats!
[219:58.81]Hey, there's rats.
[219:59.35]Hey, forget about what happened to the screen.
[220:00.63]Look at rats.
[220:01.13]I'm now in Dr. Dramish's private lab.
[220:04.68]Let's look for Marcos and Lagrange's grafted microfilms right away.
[220:18.47]A wire stripper.
[220:21.87]Up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, up.
[220:25.35]I didn't know if it wanted the whole song.
[220:26.93]Like, up, up, down, down, up, up, down.
[220:31.02]Up, up, down, down, up, down, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[220:35.38]Like, how am I supposed to know?
[220:36.74]I thought it was going to be the whole down, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, down, down, down, up, down, down, down.
[220:50.01]I was trying to figure it out.
[220:52.10]I got wire cutters now.
[220:54.30]That's where Dr. Dramish hides her little secrets.
[220:59.48]I'm getting to be an expert on safe cracking.
[221:02.60]This is going to be easy as pie.
[221:05.96]Tug on my nuts to release the anger.
[221:08.28]What are you talking about?
[221:09.43]I'll try it.
[221:20.02]Like this.
[221:22.06]Oh, I ripped him.
[221:23.22]Oh, I ripped him.
[221:24.48]I ripped it in half.
[221:25.68]Who told me to do that?
[221:26.50]Oh.
[221:27.58]Alright, what am I doing?
[221:34.01]Put the glass on?
[221:34.53]There's three glasses to make sure you can see.
[221:49.47]Nothing there.
[221:51.87]Nothing there because I need to put a business.
[221:53.31]I need to put caramels under there and see what kind of microorganisms are on it.
[222:00.27]Exit to the exterior.
[222:01.81]No.
[222:06.84]I need to look at the rats under the microscope.
[222:12.08]Eat the caramel.
[222:14.24]I got to put like a thing under there.
[222:18.34]Imagine this being timed.
[222:21.23]Nothing there.
[222:22.97]We got any wires to cut?
[222:27.87]I don't see wires to snip.
[222:33.45]Okay, well, they're over there.
[222:35.40]Right.
[222:36.52]Now that I've stripped the two wires, we're ready for one hell of a short circuit.
[222:42.60]Easy does it.
[222:44.34]I can get one hell of a shock with these bare hands.
[222:47.32]Caramel.
[222:50.01]I'd better find something else if I don't want to electrocute myself.
[222:55.05]Uh, glasses.
[222:59.71]There's nothing else in this coat.
[223:04.64]Santa mask?
[223:06.04]Draw.
[223:08.20]What did I get?
[223:08.88]I found an old tape player.
[223:10.79]An old tape recorder.
[223:15.20]I thought I saw a wire in here earlier.
[223:17.38]Ah, here it is.
[223:28.08]Really creepy laugh for no reason.
[223:29.74]Alright, use wire on... Nothing else of interest here.
[223:41.17]Okay.
[223:43.29]Alright, use wire on wires.
[223:48.27]Great.
[223:48.87]It worked.
[223:49.83]Short circuit.
[223:50.19]The short circuit opened the safe.
[223:53.30]Sweet.
[224:01.68]So, were those tapes?
[224:03.00]Great.
[224:03.78]The microfilm.
[224:04.97]Great.
[224:05.77]Didi was right.
[224:07.09]Both of them.
[224:08.27]Didi.
[224:08.53]Alright.
[224:09.35]Use the microfilm on the microscope.
[224:11.19]Let's take a look.
[224:12.19]See what we got here.
[224:21.75]Great.
[224:22.83]I've worked out how to decipher the codes.
[224:25.53]And how is that exactly?
[224:26.89]Zoom in on the microfilm.
[224:28.39]N1 or N2.
[224:32.29]Miv.
[224:33.60]That's Marcus's coat.
[224:34.88]Okay, that's Miv for Marcus.
[224:38.86]And then Klee.
[224:40.88]That's Lagrange's coat.
[224:42.36]Miv and Klee.
[224:45.80]Miv for Marcus, Klee for the other guy.
[224:48.10]I forgot his name already.
[224:53.81]Why is this lady such a creep?
[224:59.84]The microfilm from Dr. Dramish's lab was pretty incriminating.
[225:03.78]The fact that Marcos and Lagrange had had their throats cut by a left-handed person with a very sharp knife was certainly suspicious.
[225:10.69]But what motive could Dramish possibly have?
[225:15.19]Didi and Ada decided to go for a stroll to mull things over.
[225:19.25]I stayed behind trying to piece this puzzle together.
[225:22.43]We're at the end game, guys.
[225:29.30]The screech of tires and the sound of a gunshot brought me back to Earth with a thud.
[225:33.30]I leaped up and ran outside.
[225:34.26]Right when he sits down.
[225:35.22]Didi was lying in a pool of blood.
[225:37.20]The thugs had mistaken him for me.
[225:39.68]The only sign of Ada was her handbag.
[225:41.97]I grabbed it and ran.
[225:43.81]I had to think.
[225:44.97]Finally, we get to run.
[225:48.51]Finally, the namesake.
[225:50.33]I wandered alone for a long time before ending up in a gloomy restaurant where I tried to figure things out.
[225:55.73]I could smell Ava's perfume, and I began to relive memories of our relationship.
[226:00.37]Memories which I now saw in a new light.
[226:02.39]Our first meeting.
[226:06.23]This game sucks.
[226:06.99]Too easy.
[226:08.77]The feeling I was being watched right from the start.
[226:12.23]The ink stain on her hand which proved as clear as day she'd been in Lagrange's office before me.
[226:18.28]Everything seemed to point to the fact that she was somehow tied up with the murders.
[226:22.91]I thought that was supposed to be her at the beginning.
[226:31.15]The game's almost over?
[226:31.95]When the knife slipped out of her bag, it only confirmed my suspicions.
[226:36.32]Was she really the murderer?
[226:37.46]Was that supposed to be her?
[226:38.96]Now I had to live with this knowledge and try to continue with my investigation.
[226:43.38]Suddenly everything was even more complicated than before.
[226:47.72]I was lost in my thoughts when I was called to the phone.
[226:52.08]So, there's been no development of anything.
[226:56.66]All the character development has been in montage cutscenes.
[227:00.67]Whoa, you're Max Gardner, the meddling pencil pusher.
[227:02.79]You might still be alive now, but not for long.
[227:07.35]Uh, is that supposed to... Whoa, that sounded like gunfire.
[227:14.34]Whoa, it's dark outside.
[227:16.91]That's interesting.
[227:17.93]Okay.
[227:19.45]So... That red... That's not what... That's not... That's... That's not even old school video game.
[227:33.78]Where's the red dot?
[227:35.22]Alright.
[227:35.66]What about... I put my glasses on.
[227:39.80]Magnet.
[227:40.46]Shine the magnet at him.
[227:43.46]Show the knife in the window.
[227:44.42]Just scare him.
[227:46.83]Can I get down?
[227:47.63]Okay, get down.
[227:58.35]I got the hell out of that restaurant and barely escaped with my life.
[228:01.82]Good for you.
[228:02.16]I only got a brief break, though, because I was still carrying a transmitter in my pocket.
[228:09.98]What do you mean, transmitter?
[228:13.16]It desperately wants me to do something with the trash.
[228:15.64]What was I supposed to- I don't have any transmitter!
[228:25.67]The magnet?
[228:33.56]Oh, goddammit.
[228:35.04]Doc-
[228:38.34]It so badly wanted me to do something with that trash.
[228:40.88]Card?
[228:41.00]ID?
[228:41.20]Transmitter?
[228:41.98]Glasses.
[228:42.14]Magnet.
[228:42.48]Knife.
[228:42.64]It's probably the knife.
[228:43.30]Yeah, it was the knife.
[228:44.40]It was her knife.
[228:45.42]I took that out of her purse.
[228:46.38]She probably has a GPS device on it to make sure she knows where it is at all times.
[229:17.96]It's the magnet, okay?
[229:18.98]The magnet has a transmission device on it.
[229:22.68]It's got a little dongle in there.
[229:25.00]Reach up to the stratosphere.
[229:28.62]Beam back down.
[229:29.30]It's a little thing.
[229:30.10]You can put it onto documents.
[229:34.00]That would make sense.
[229:34.70]Throw it in there.
[229:35.42]Get rid of that.
[229:35.90]Don't want that anymore.
[229:38.80]Small enough to be conspicuous, right?
[229:43.19]Should be good.
[229:46.42]I got the hell out of that restaurant and barely escaped with my life.
[229:50.60]I only got a brief break though, because I was still carrying a transmitter in my pocket.
[230:17.34]It has to be that.
[230:18.48]Why would it be the glasses?
[230:21.96]If it is the glasses, that's really dumb.
[230:40.91]It's the glasses.
[230:41.53]It's the fucking glasses.
[230:48.28]I got the hell out of that restaurant and barely escaped with my life.
[230:52.70]I only got a brief break though, because I was still carrying a transmitter in my pocket.
[231:03.99]When I figured out the glasses were bugged, I tossed them.
[231:07.23]I let the guy tailing me take a pleasant stroll after the garbage truck.
[231:11.41]I was through with being a target.
[231:14.92]I decided to go back to Lagrange's office where I'd seen his weapon collection.
[231:19.22]But in the alley behind the pool hall, I got sidetracked by an enterprising youth and his rigged card game.
[231:25.00]His rap started to get to me.
[231:26.91]I was just considering smashing the jerk's face in when I spotted Marcos' watch among all his crap.
[231:32.97]I decided to play it cool.
[231:38.05]I don't... I don't know.
[231:38.91]Hold on.
[231:40.43]I wanna... Let's save this.
[231:49.04]Okay, hold on, where are we at?
[231:51.34]80%, we actually are almost done with the game.
[231:53.16]So we got cards, his hands.
[231:57.54]I wish he'd just buzz off.
[231:59.04]I can't just smash my fist on his hands?
[232:01.84]He offered me a go with the cards.
[232:03.70]I tried to tell him I had nothing to bet, but he wouldn't listen.
[232:07.46]I ate his bag.
[232:10.17]The kid refused to move if I didn't buy one of his watches.
[232:12.83]I sure didn't want to attract any attention.
[232:16.53]Marco's watch.
[232:18.51]That's Tony Marcos' watch.
[232:22.64]Alright, so here.
[232:23.14]Here's Ada's bag.
[232:24.46]I'll trade you.
[232:27.14]I'll trade you.
[232:34.46]Sure is a nice watch.
[232:35.62]I might as well try winning that one.
[232:37.70]You wanna play?
[232:38.68]Show me some green.
[232:39.82]Yeah, this dude's harmless.
[232:41.50]But I haven't got any cash.
[232:43.12]Ada's bag.
[232:46.16]Knife.
[232:50.28]I can't stab him.
[232:53.06]Lipstick.
[232:56.72]This is the whole bag.
[233:02.29]The schematic.
[233:08.39]Business card.
[233:09.91]I told the sucker I was Inspector Van Bell.
[233:12.51]He was familiar with the inspector's reputation and offered me a free game.
[233:15.87]Hey, thanks, man.
[233:16.27]I had to guess where the Queen of Diamonds was three times.
[233:18.83]Okay, where's the Queen of Diamonds?

[240:33.57]I feel like, look at how divided this is.
[240:37.35]Everybody's so divided.
[240:47.37]Go with the least chosen answer, which is right.

[242:37.77]What do I do about this?
[242:44.44]You guys all say left, you all say middle.
[242:46.42]It's impossible.
[242:47.43]You can't win it.
[242:48.05]You gotta do something.
[242:49.47]The cards are straight.
[242:50.41]Follow that queen.

[242:55.41]Eight of clubs.
[242:56.05]Where's the little lady?

[242:59.80]Up, up, round they go.
[243:01.74]Where's the little lady now?
[243:14.57]That one.
[243:16.72]You sure?
[243:17.38]Ah, sorry, bud.
[243:25.74]Okay.
[243:26.84]Let me tell you guys something.
[243:27.94]Listen to me.
[243:29.14]You have to listen to me.
[243:31.18]You do understand that there is a 33% chance for me to randomly pick this, right?
[243:34.30]Okay, if it's for real.
[243:35.65]This is choice number like fucking 20.
[243:37.05]If you have not picked randomly at a 33% chance and 20 choices...
[244:18.09]Even 43% of the chat.
[244:21.28]No, like 60, 70% of the chat has been wrong every single fucking time too.
[244:26.98]So it's not just me.
[244:50.40]There.
[244:55.12]Oh, just two more times.
[244:56.80]Two more times.
[244:58.02]What?
[245:01.12]Three fucking percentages.
[245:04.28]And three.
[245:04.90]Gather round now.
[245:05.62]The watching's free.
[245:06.52]The cards are straight.
[245:07.34]Follow the queen.
[245:08.08]Is she there?
[245:08.58]Is she there?
[245:09.06]Is she there?
[245:09.60]Off we go.
[245:11.14]Nice and slow.
[245:12.18]Where's the little lady now?
[245:26.18]Here.
[245:29.38]Alright, that watch is one win away.
[245:36.18]And one.
[245:39.10]And two.
[245:41.04]And three.
[245:42.16]Gather round now, that watching's free.
[245:43.90]The cards are straight, follow the queen.
[245:45.52]One, two, three, where's she going?
[245:47.84]Up, up, round they go.
[245:49.40]Where's that little lady now?
[246:00.72]It's that one.
[246:06.26]Phew.
[246:06.82]I got the little crook off my back.
[246:09.81]And the watch I wanted.
[246:13.49]All I had to do now was break into Lagrange's office.
[246:16.35]It's cardboard?
[246:19.39]What the fuck?
[246:20.19]But there was another problem waiting for me.
[246:24.75]Gather right now!
[246:25.57]The lock is closed!
[246:26.71]Which locker is the lock that opens?
[246:27.89]It's a rectangular slot.
[246:38.60]Paul.
[246:41.34]No, that didn't work.
[246:44.48]Does Paul's work in the middle one?
[246:48.46]No.
[246:51.82]Paul.
[246:55.64]Oh, nuts.
[247:00.29]Save it.
[247:01.17]Save it.
[247:02.13]Save it.
[247:13.07]It's a rectangular slot.
[247:49.22]Miv and Cly.
[248:01.16]Four, six.
[248:01.52]This is this bullshit again.
[248:12.96]Four times on the left clock.
[248:15.62]With whose key?
[248:37.55]Now, Tony's cake.
[248:46.12]Four times on the left with Tony's cake.
[248:56.36]That sounds really, I like the way that sounds though.
[249:04.77]Okay, that's not, that's not doing anything.
[249:06.23]Hold on.
[249:08.74]Can I turn it around?
[249:11.54]Alright.
[249:12.36]I have to do this dumb thing, guys.
[249:14.58]It's not as simple as 1, 2, 3.
[249:15.76]Alright.
[249:19.04]Put it in the center.
[249:21.02]And then use it.
[249:25.54]What the fuck do you want me to do here?
[249:26.82]Game.
[249:30.17]It is that simple.
[249:34.11]It's that simple.
[249:34.95]It's 1, 2, 3.
[249:46.29]I want to turn this around.
[250:04.09]4, 2, 1?
[250:11.59]This would be 2, and then here comes the 1.
[250:17.04]Hey!
[250:18.56]Look at that, guys.
[250:20.07]You did a fantastic job.
[250:20.75]I finally managed to get a gun from the Grange's collection.
[250:23.69]Thanks to what Sergio told me, I found the building where his men hung out.
[250:27.67]I knew I'd never be the same again after what was about to happen.
[250:30.61]Shotgun?
[250:32.41]I didn't give a damn who was who.
[250:33.93]Oh god.
[250:34.68]I was driven by a thirst for vengeance.
[250:37.20]I was gonna make Ada's kidnappers and Dee Dee's killers pay.
[250:42.52]One by one.
[250:44.10]There's that guy.
[250:44.76]Are we gonna take that guy with a shotgun?
[250:48.29]Is this like a grenade launcher?
[250:49.43]What is this?
[250:49.89]Why would you shoot a shotgun from this far away?
[250:55.47]Do I have to fire the gun?
[250:57.45]I'm pretty good at this game.
[251:20.22]Okay, I didn't do any of that.
[251:21.20]Like I told you, all the cool shit in this game happens in like a 45 second cutscene.
[251:31.08]He's- that guy's still alive.
[251:34.46]I shot that guy in the shoulder.
[251:36.11]Deep down without realizing it, I'd set Ada free so I'd get to the bottom of things.
[251:41.41]How could she have played this obscene comedy?
[251:44.71]Sleeping with me when all the cops in town were after me for the murder she'd committed in cold blood.
[251:50.94]Don't put the knife down in front of her.
[251:52.78]That's very easy for her to grab.
[251:53.74]Alright, I have a theory.
[251:54.44]Here's my theory.
[252:13.04]I think that they filmed this whole game and the audio guy forgot to record audio half of the time.
[252:35.07]Wouldn't that make sense to have to ADR everything?
[252:37.83]Not only was she leading me to prove my innocence to the police, but like a schmuck I was left to confront Kevork at the Institute.
[252:46.96]Hold on, what?
[252:50.20]Still got 15% of the game to go.
[252:53.18]So I, the Institute.
[252:59.87]A man and woman are talking behind this door.
[253:04.97]Ring the bell.
[253:05.65]It's a timer.
[253:06.95]They must use it for lab experiments.
[253:09.01]What, now I'm being experimented on?
[253:11.35]Use bell on door.
[253:13.44]Use clown nose on... Just hold on to clown nose.
[253:18.08]To the right.
[253:19.76]Hey, there's Dr. Dramish again with Kvork himself.
[253:23.37]At last I can put a face to the name and voice of the elite's brainchild.
[253:30.01]So, that little man with his silver cane is Kvork, mastermind of the elite and founding father of this research institute, both of which he created to execute his evil plans.
[253:42.04]Hmm, well, isn't that interesting?
[253:43.77]I get it now.
[253:45.85]It was thanks to Dr. Dramish's research that Kvork was able to carry out his illegal biological experiments.
[253:53.71]Okay.
[253:55.17]So obviously I gotta break the glass here.
[253:57.61]I can place something on the ledge in front of this window if I want.
[254:01.10]Smash my glass with the hands.
[254:02.56]They have no idea I'm here.
[254:04.34]I have to find a way of taking them by surprise.
[254:06.80]Okay, I'm gonna throw the... Wait, maybe he's gonna do it for me.
[254:11.89]Uh... Magnet on window.
[254:16.67]Knife on window.
[254:17.55]I get it now.
[254:18.87]It was thanks to Dr. Dramisch's research that Kevork was able to carry out his illegal biological experiments.
[254:25.68]Put the clown nose on.
[254:29.94]I can place something on the ledge in front of this window if I want.
[254:37.65]Can I look over here?
[254:38.31]Alright, so I'm going to put the bell
[254:46.32]on the sill.
[254:46.88]I better not still be here when it goes off.
[254:49.84]Okay, so bell on the sill.
[254:51.52]They're gonna... It's gonna ring and they're gonna hear it and then... What?
[254:56.34]What am I doing?
[254:56.90]Well, hold on.
[254:57.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[254:58.37]Knife on window.
[255:13.50]Okay, well, no.
[255:14.84]That's correct.
[255:16.02]They must use it for lab experiments.
[255:19.76]So... Now what?
[255:24.68]Hey, there's Dr. Dramish again with Kvork himself.
[255:28.29]At last I can put a face to the name and voice of the elite's brainchild.
[255:37.77]I can't do, like, lipstick on window?
[255:40.15]I can't write, like, HELP?
[255:44.48]I can place something on the ledge in front of this window if I want.
[255:47.94]I can't hurt the fuck you on the glass?
[255:52.26]Alright, let's go back.
[255:53.82]Can I just leave the room?
[255:59.81]There's only one way to neutralize them.
[256:02.15]Take them by surprise.
[256:03.17]Alright, so... It's risky.
[256:04.71]I get it.
[256:05.07]Next time round, I'll go.
[256:08.33]Put the bell on the windowsill, let it go, and then run out the window.
[256:10.58]Run out the door.
[256:12.60]Bell, windowsill, go.
[256:13.52]I better not still be here when it goes off.
[256:16.88]Out the window.
[256:18.02]Stop saying window, it's a door.
[256:25.47]Good.
[256:27.05]Wait, I'm going into their room?
[256:28.87]Why?
[256:29.11]That's the room I'm in?
[256:35.42]What's happening right now?
[256:36.38]I opened up that room to the door?
[256:43.34]What dimension is this?
[256:46.73]That door to my right.
[256:50.43]Hold on a second, my brain.
[256:54.55]There's a door in front of me, and there's a window to my right.
[256:58.07]When I open the door in front of me, this door over here opens.
[257:05.70]What world is this?
[257:15.85]A corner?
[257:18.49]What?
[257:18.86]No, I like turn to the left and I open a door.
[257:22.18]This door is to the right of the door that's to the left here.
[257:26.26]Look, looking to the left.
[257:28.42]This door opens straight, right?
[257:31.59]To the right?
[257:33.67]There's a door over here.
[257:35.19]That door's to the right of this door.
[257:37.21]That's not the same door.
[257:43.28]What a load of shit.
[257:47.62]It's a timer.
[257:49.02]They must use it for lab experiments.
[257:50.66]That's not the same door.
[257:52.20]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[257:53.30]How would I have opened it that quickly?
[257:57.98]If I have to turn my head and see that door, that's a lot of shit.
[258:14.60]No!
[258:14.98]What?
[258:15.28]No!
[258:15.78]No!
[258:17.08]Stop it!
[258:17.46]Stop it!
[258:17.74]Stop!
[258:27.18]I'm just panicking about the fucking stupid bell.
[258:31.04]It's a timer.
[258:32.36]They must use it for lab experiments.
[258:37.16]Hey, there's Dr. Dramish again with Kevork himself.
[258:40.74]At last I can put a face to the name and voice of the elite's brainchild.
[258:47.14]I better not still be here when it goes off.
[258:54.07]See, I better not still be here when it goes off is what he said.
[258:57.21]So if it goes off and I'm still here, then I didn't do what he said.
[259:05.74]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[259:10.49]Let's see now.
[259:11.35]Is Kevork the most dangerous of the two?
[259:13.65]I gotta knife somebody, right?
[259:14.99]It's a timer.
[259:31.98]You must use it for lab experiments.
[259:34.71]What do you mean, are you serious?
[259:36.19]Like, I didn't know I was gonna walk in there and be like, hey!
[259:39.71]Time to, like... I gotta kill somebody in here now.
[259:43.34]I thought I was gonna, like, sneak around or sneak out.
[259:45.88]I don't know.
[259:46.38]I better not still be here when it goes off.
[259:51.19]I'm gonna kill the guy at the cane first.
[259:52.43]I don't even give a fuck.
[260:04.62]Alright, let's kill the guy with the cane.
[260:10.87]My surprise entry gave me the upper hand, and I kept it.
[260:14.59]The doctor threatened to shoot, then just gave up.
[260:18.37]She launched into a lengthy explanation.
[260:20.35]I want to hear the explanation.
[260:21.73]No, she'd never shared the elite's extremist views.
[260:24.49]She just wanted to carry out her research.
[260:27.37]She claimed that she never imagined what the outcome would be.
[260:31.24]She was finished with the elite.
[260:32.96]She was going to turn herself in to the police to put an end to the carnage.
[260:37.90]Kvork, furious about her confession, soon put an end to the conversation.
[260:48.73]He locked the room.
[260:50.69]And filled it with poisonous gas.
[260:52.33]Filled it with poisonous gas.
[260:54.81]He sure did.
[260:55.53]Okay.
[260:55.71]I could hear Dr. Dramish trying to say something.
[260:58.57]Moving closer, I caught her dying words.
[261:01.13]Something about Kvork's microfilm.
[261:03.96]She managed to make a mark on the floor before she died.
[261:06.84]An X. Oh.
[261:15.50]Oh no, get out before the poison takes over.
[261:22.38]I'm dying.
[261:31.97]Here's the locking system for the door.
[261:34.25]It's probably magnetic.
[261:36.60]Oh, is it?
[261:40.18]What was that?
[261:49.65]Why would you fill the room with poisonous gas?
[261:51.69]There's nothing more touching in life than a reconciliation.
[261:54.93]I felt guilty as hell that I blamed Ada for my friend's death.
[261:57.75]Uh, gas.
[261:57.93]Poisonous gas.
[261:58.51]Time to leave.
[261:59.57]Poisonous gas.
[262:01.63]We were reunited against the evil elite.
[262:04.89]We moved to strike at their nerve center.
[262:07.48]The secret room.
[262:09.08]The secret room.
[262:10.66]Okay.
[262:14.64]Hurry up.
[262:15.32]Kvork's coming with reinforcements.
[262:17.43]Okay, let me save it.
[262:19.91]I'm going to save this and I'm going to call this one... Go Back and Knife Lady.
[262:33.06]Because that's what I'm going to go do right now.
[262:35.42]Curious.
[262:36.18]Just want to know.
[262:40.10]So this was... What's it been called again?
[262:41.42]Endgame, right?
[262:51.65]Yeah, okay.
[262:52.35]I want it just not delayed.
[262:53.49]It's a timer.
[262:54.95]They must use it for lab experiments.
[262:56.45]I actually am curious if this does anything.
[262:58.03]I'm going to assume the budget was probably still low in this game.
[263:04.85]When I go knife first, he probably falls and I have to grab him or something.
[263:10.42]I better not still be here when it goes off.
[263:22.17]Here we go.
[263:27.31]I want to see his cane gun.
[263:34.20]Yeah.
[263:34.54]No, it don't work.
[263:38.39]Nope.
[263:39.57]It does not work.
[263:42.67]88%.
[263:44.91]Almost there.
[263:45.47]Okay, locking system.
[263:47.05]It looks like the shape of a watch.
[263:48.67]Yes, but not just any watch, I bet.
[263:51.41]Somebody's special watch.
[263:54.64]Hmm.
[263:54.86]Nothing's happening.
[263:56.72]The watch fits perfectly, though.
[263:59.88]I did this dumb thing.
[264:04.08]Can I just turn it upside down?
[264:08.71]Pick the pen out.
[264:11.65]No, I gotta look at, like, what the... Hold on.
[264:13.57]Six.
[264:15.35]Five.
[264:19.12]Six.
[264:19.80]Oh, fucking goddammit, man.
[264:22.40]Nothing.
[264:23.64]There must be a special way of setting it.
[264:25.88]Yeah, I gotta get in there and set the watch.
[264:28.10]But it's, like, six.
[264:29.60]I can't even read that.
[264:30.76]It's so muddled and blurry.
[264:33.32]Eleven.
[264:35.36]Use winder pin on center of watch.
[264:37.18]I know.
[264:37.66]I know.
[264:38.10]I know.
[264:44.79]I know, and it just, it's not gonna work, is it?
[264:47.51]Okay, close it up.
[265:05.50]Nothing's happening.
[265:07.24]The watch fits perfectly, though.
[265:13.49]So here is where you'll need Marcus's watch.
[265:15.81]Read the Elite file again.
[265:17.07]It explains how to use it.
[265:18.67]The winder is used to set the hands to noon.
[265:21.29]Then in back of the watch, you must turn the inner circle.
[265:23.91]Place the mark on the outer circle of the watch in front of the stem.
[265:27.19]Then confirm with the winder.
[265:28.61]Then do the same thing with the other marks.
[265:30.83]Somebody has to do this for me.
[265:31.84]I have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.
[265:34.04]Like, I could probably sit here and figure that out, but like, what the fuck did you just say?
[265:52.77]OK, turn it around.
[265:56.13]And then I need to turn this ring to here.
[266:02.27]Oh, no, no, no.
[266:02.81]OK, I get it.
[266:04.91]I get it.
[266:07.21]Stops there.
[266:09.19]Then this is turned around now, right?
[266:11.35]That would be turned around.
[266:15.07]Let me make sure.
[266:18.58]Is it?
[266:30.24]Can I close it?
[266:31.40]Nothing.
[266:32.62]There must be a special way of setting it.
[266:34.80]Why can I not close the watch?
[266:37.36]Oh, we're dead.
[266:47.64]It looks like the shape of a watch.
[266:49.32]Yes, but not just any watch, I bet.
[266:53.26]Yeah, I know.
[266:55.92]Take this out.
[266:58.67]Give me the fucking pen.
[267:00.99]Noon.
[267:04.11]Spin it around.
[267:05.97]No, no.
[267:06.45]Get it in there.
[267:09.70]Okay.
[267:10.34]Turn it around.
[267:14.86]So then it's the disk ring.
[267:20.90]What happens if I turn this?
[267:23.14]No, it goes all the way.
[267:23.94]Didn't I have that right?
[267:25.68]I thought I had it right.
[267:28.78]Because that brings out these.
[267:40.78]Is that it?
[267:42.98]Do I do this now?
[267:49.30]Because it's stopping it here.
[267:50.54]I mean, that technically is spinning it.
[267:54.57]Is that turning it around?
[267:55.37]I don't think so.
[267:58.88]No, it is.
[268:00.22]No, it's not.
[268:07.24]Nothing's happening.
[268:08.97]The watch fits perfectly, though.
[268:17.38]You're confused.
[268:18.86]I am, too.
[268:28.37]Why does the stream remind me of the Fred movies?
[268:34.85]What are you talking about?
[268:36.77]What?
[268:39.33]What do you mean the Fred movies?
[268:43.75]I am offended.
[268:44.51]I thought I was the only one.
[268:53.84]Please.
[268:58.29]OK, now turn it back around.
[269:04.37]Wait, what?
[269:06.37]Oh, fuck.
[269:07.11]OK, 6, 11.
[269:08.65]No, this is not right.
[269:09.39]6 has to be, is this correct?
[269:15.62]No.
[269:26.98]Got it.
[269:45.01]Too late.
[269:45.63]The security system only allows one person through at a time.
[269:47.88]Let's go.
[269:49.38]Who do you think you are entering my place like this?
[269:51.78]You're going to regret that move.
[269:53.22]Don't waste your time trying to be clever.
[269:55.24]You're my prisoners now.
[269:56.82]I suggest you start praying fast.
[270:00.46]Don't worry.
[270:01.32]We're safe here in the secret room for the time being.
[270:04.40]The only way out is to find the information in this control terminal.
[270:08.60]Look and see if you can find any weapons.
[270:10.66]The only way out is to click on the control terminal.
[270:13.01]In the meantime, I'll try and figure out the terminal system.
[270:16.59]Alright.
[270:16.79]Let's figure out this child.
[270:18.01]God, there's a timer.
[270:19.19]There's no card in the player.
[270:20.51]I have to save it right now.
[270:24.83]Save, end game.
[270:26.61]No, just in case.
[270:32.22]Okay, I got tapes, right?
[270:34.34]Activated watch.
[270:35.54]Lipstick.
[270:36.08]No, didn't I have tapes?
[270:38.60]The keyboard's digital.
[270:42.74]Card schematic.
[270:45.12]Slot.
[270:45.62]Get back, you scum!
[270:47.52]Don't you lay a hand on it!
[270:51.22]Slot in position.
[270:52.90]Slot.
[270:53.68]Card slot.
[270:55.40]Is it the right one?
[270:57.75]Is it the right one?
[270:58.65]Cards.
[270:59.01]I have to make a card.
[271:00.55]It's pointless.
[271:01.91]There's no mercy for the likes of you.
[271:04.98]This slot is the same shape as the key rings.
[271:09.32]Tony's key.
[271:12.96]Paul's key.
[271:13.58]Nothing.
[271:20.04]Nothing.
[271:20.62]Are you kidding me?
[271:21.42]How?
[271:24.94]Put the watch in there.
[271:32.44]So, you're the woman who decimated my truths.
[271:36.36]Well, now you're going to die like your foolish father and brother who thought they could ruin my plans.
[271:42.21]This is annoying.
[271:46.63]What's in here?
[271:47.09]Key?
[271:48.87]What's that?
[271:49.92]Cigar?
[271:51.56]Great.
[271:52.86]A laser.
[271:53.88]A laser?
[271:54.12]It can only be used once, so I'd better choose my adversary carefully.
[271:57.68]Okay, I have to shoot somebody with a laser.
[271:59.68]Max, I found a little pocket laser.
[272:02.76]It can only be used once, but it looks pretty powerful.
[272:05.74]Great.
[272:06.90]Make sure you aim straight.
[272:09.28]Max, I found a little pocket laser.
[272:12.36]It can only be used once, but it looks pretty powerful.
[272:15.14]How could you tell you could use it once?
[272:16.55]Make sure you aim straight.
[272:17.69]Okay, door.
[272:19.49]This is the other exit marked on the plan.
[272:21.71]Remote control receiver.
[272:24.11]It's the receptor for an infrared remote control.
[272:27.39]Okay, nothing else.
[272:28.47]Other room?
[272:28.79]I wonder how safe we are here.
[272:31.03]Kevork and his men must be planning to attack.
[272:33.78]Yes, they are.
[272:34.30]As for you, you meddling journalist, you shouldn't have gotten involved.
[272:40.42]You're not capable of doing this story.
[272:43.02]I can hear noises over there.
[272:45.12]What's going on?
[272:47.34]Is the door going to open?
[272:49.56]Who's there?
[272:51.14]If they come in through there, what can I use to defend us?
[272:54.26]A laser that you just picked up.
[272:57.15]Alright, let's go back to Max.
[272:59.45]Can I watch what you're doing?
[273:01.59]If you like.
[273:03.32]Okay, so we got cards, cards, cards, card eject button.
[273:07.82]Shut the fuck up.
[273:09.68]I am Lev Kavach, the sole survivor of a new order in this dying century.
[273:17.17]Card switch.
[273:18.45]Contact.
[273:19.51]Insert card into player.
[273:21.49]Stop.
[273:22.51]Get away from that machine.
[273:24.39]Immediately.
[273:25.51]It's death banks are sacred.
[273:27.87]Okay, so now card schematic.
[273:31.74]Into slot.
[273:32.88]Into position.
[273:34.40]Into ejection.
[273:35.28]No, okay, drive slot.
[273:38.02]There's no card in the player.
[273:39.62]Okay, card eject.
[273:40.72]How would you like to join my laboratory rats?
[273:44.24]I need some fresh DNA.
[273:47.40]Card eject button.
[273:52.39]Electronic card in the slot.
[273:55.77]Indicate the switch positions.
[273:58.41]Um... I don't know.
[274:02.52]Card schematic?
[274:11.88]What do you want from me?
[274:12.74]I'll be generous if you give yourselves up immediately.
[274:16.34]I'll make sure you don't suffer.
[274:25.35]I gotta get the... No, eject it.
[274:27.09]Eject the card.
[274:27.63]I gotta put that in here now.
[274:28.77]Wait.
[274:29.23]No.
[274:29.53]What?
[274:35.79]I need that.
[274:37.21]Hold on.
[274:37.45]I gotta put the card schematic in the slot.
[274:41.72]So do you really believe you can destroy a lifetime of work?
[274:51.94]Where the fuck is the card eject button?
[274:53.22]There's no card in the player.
[274:56.31]I can't, where's the card eject?
[274:57.67]The final hour has come.
[274:58.71]Oh my fucking god, man.
[275:00.43]Prepare to die.
[275:03.37]Please.
[275:08.20]No, I wanted to pick it up.
[275:12.46]This, it's so finicky to find this little button I can't even.
[275:15.36]Contact.
[275:16.42]Insert card into player.
[275:28.16]What happened?
[275:39.81]Wait, he was a good guy.
[275:41.37]I think he was a good guy.
[275:43.70]Wait, hold on.
[276:00.21]Nothing.
[276:03.57]Contact.
[276:04.63]Insert card into player.
[276:06.61]Stop!
[276:07.63]Get away from that machine!
[276:09.51]Immediately!
[276:10.63]Its database is sacred!
[276:12.71]Okay, so let me... I'm gonna put this in.
[276:19.05]Get back, you scum!
[276:20.94]Don't you lay a hand on it!
[276:23.66]So I have to match the schematic.
[276:25.50]Indicate the switch positions.
[276:27.64]But what the heck is the schematic?
[276:35.14]Switch positions, right?
[276:36.40]Like, what the heck?
[276:38.04]Like, what the heck are they talking about?
[276:50.50]S1, S2, S4, S5, S6.
[276:50.84]Just turn them all on.
[276:52.32]S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6.
[277:26.73]One and four are off.
[277:33.33]How do you know that?
[277:34.17]The little targets?
[277:51.51]Two, three, and six are next to gold bars.
[277:59.39]Give up.
[278:00.47]It's pointless.
[278:01.81]There's no mercy for the likes of you.
[278:08.88]I did it.
[278:09.96]So, how do we do it now?
[278:14.86]So, you're the woman who decimated my troops.
[278:18.80]Well, now you're going to die like your foolish father and brother who thought they could ruin my plans.
[278:26.02]Tony's key.
[278:32.16]Nothing.
[278:32.74]Oh, god damn it.
[278:33.46]It's Paul's key.
[278:38.60]Nothing.
[278:39.12]It's neither one of their keys.
[278:42.36]Is there like an activate button?
[278:45.51]As for you, you meddling journalist, you shouldn't have gotten involved.
[278:51.60]You're not capable of doing this story.
[278:54.72]Need a little help getting the six switches on the console?
[278:57.70]Examine the drawing on the card you reassembled.
[279:00.36]The switches are labeled S1 to S6.
[279:03.22]When a jumper is placed across it, the corresponding switch must be on.
[279:07.68]Otherwise, it must be off.
[279:11.32]That doesn't even help me.
[279:20.35]What does that mean?
[279:26.10]A jumper has to be 1, 4, and 5.
[279:33.21]Is that really what it is?
[279:58.87]Nothing.
[280:01.47]You just don't realize who you're up against.
[280:04.51]I am Len Kvark, the sole survivor of a new order in this dungeon.
[280:10.28]Hey, Jeremy, you might have the wrong card.
[280:11.90]Validated.
[280:15.04]Wrong switch position.
[280:15.68]Cannot function.
[280:18.60]Try it again.
[280:19.71]Get in there.
[280:21.81]Indicate the switch positions.
[280:25.69]It's the inverse.
[280:27.17]One, four, and five.
[280:31.95]Alright.
[280:32.69]How would you like to join my laboratory rats?
[280:34.06]Because they have to be turned on.
[280:35.86]I need some fresh DNA.
[280:40.66]No, wait.
[280:41.32]Wait, stop it, Jeremy.
[280:42.90]One, four, five.
[280:47.34]Like that.
[280:48.90]Thank you.
[280:51.56]Wrong switch position.
[280:53.10]Cannot function.
[280:56.19]I'll be generous if you give yourselves up immediately.
[280:59.77]I'll make sure you don't suffer.
[281:04.93]Indicate the switch positions.
[281:09.72]One, four, five need to be on, right?
[281:16.36]That's what we all came to the agreement.
[281:18.20]One, four, and five need to be turned off.
[281:19.84]So do you really believe you can destroy a lifetime of work?
[281:29.77]Two, three, six.
[281:32.44]So why did everybody say... Your final hour has come.
[281:36.86]Prepare to die.
[281:39.66]Two, three, and six.
[281:45.57]Wrong switch position.
[281:47.09]Cannot function.
[281:58.85]I wonder how safe we are here.
[282:01.19]Kevork and his men must be planning to attack.
[282:09.05]I'm finally going to get to kill this guy.
[282:10.29]It's been forever.
[282:11.13]Thank God.
[282:12.23]Oh, no, I didn't.
[282:13.23]I didn't pick up the laser in this playthrough.
[282:23.78]Alright, so... What is going on here?
[282:32.96]Get the card that matches the schematic.
[282:35.08]Is it that one?
[282:38.15]Contact.
[282:39.21]Insert card into player.
[282:39.87]What in the name of God?
[282:41.21]Stop!
[282:42.21]Get away from that machine!
[282:44.09]Immediately!
[282:45.27]I have to eject one of these.
[282:47.83]This is what you're telling me.
[282:51.10]All these tiny buttons can be fucking pulled out.
[282:53.20]Don't you lay a hand on it!
[282:54.44]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[283:00.80]Indicate the switch positions.
[283:04.03]But did... Give up.
[283:12.98]It's pointless.
[283:14.34]There's no mercy for the likes of you.
[283:18.41]Is it the right one?
[283:26.53]Are you just telling me it was this easy from the start?
[283:30.36]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[283:32.73]It was this simple from the start.
[283:33.79]I just had to examine these.
[283:34.67]2, 3, 6, 2, 6, which is 2, 3, 6, 2.
[283:40.21]So 2...
[283:57.88]That's correct, right?
[283:59.20]That's what has to be up two, three, and six.
[284:03.60]This is correct.
[284:04.14]No.
[284:04.32]All the way.
[284:04.84]Wrong way.
[284:06.16]Two, three, like that.
[284:06.86]It's the wrong way.
[284:07.84]Don't even tell me.
[284:29.31]Maybe.
[284:33.07]Wrong way.
[284:34.05]It's not the wrong way.
[284:35.09]That's correct.
[284:35.87]Enter each code and validate separately.
[284:38.19]What are you talking about?
[284:39.25]What does this mean?
[284:39.77]What are you talking about?
[284:40.53]Enter each code and separate... What do you mean?
[284:42.43]What are you talking about?
[284:43.13]What do you want me to do?
[284:44.61]What do you want me to do?
[284:46.41]What?
[284:46.85]Two?
[284:47.21]Three?
[284:47.49]How would you like to join my laboratory rats?
[284:52.55]Two, three, six?
[284:53.11]I need some fresh DNA.
[284:54.07]Where are you guys getting 1004 from?
[285:02.03]They're gonna put a guy's fucking key in.
[285:07.70]Nothing.
[285:09.98]Fuck.
[285:14.04]Nothing.
[285:14.42]1004.
[285:16.84]I'll be generous if you give yourselves up immediately.
[285:21.14]I'll make sure you don't suffer.
[285:23.18]Code first.
[285:24.44]Tony's ring.
[285:28.50]Correct code.
[285:29.92]Continue procedure.
[285:31.48]What do you mean continue the procedure?
[285:33.32]How do I take it out?
[285:36.70]What does it want me to do now?
[285:39.32]What do I do now?
[285:43.27]So do you really believe you can destroy a lifetime of work?
[285:47.57]Put the other key in.
[285:52.57]Nothing.
[285:57.45]Kevin's key?
[286:00.39]Wait, the micro- Your final hour has come.
[286:06.88]Prepare to die!
[286:08.40]I gotta- Nothing.
[286:20.21]No!
[286:27.39]Correct code.
[286:28.81]Continue procedure.
[286:30.17]What is the rest of the procedure?
[286:32.72]I need to get the gun.
[286:40.30]How am I going to do this?
[286:42.40]Great.
[286:43.72]A laser.
[286:44.96]It can only be used once, so I'd better choose my adversary carefully.
[286:51.55]I wonder how safe we are here.
[286:53.89]Kevork and his men must be planning to attack.
[286:56.23]What's the next thing I have to do?
[286:59.64]Okay, I'm not gonna shoot him.
[287:00.54]He's a good guy, right?
[287:04.86]No, what?
[287:08.86]Oh my fucking god.
[287:13.02]He clearly shot me, like, in the foot.
[287:16.60]And then I got hit in the chest.
[287:18.98]Oh my god, this sucks.
[287:21.52]Let's try this again.
[287:23.32]Okay.
[287:24.14]Here it is.
[287:25.54]Turn on the fucking machine.
[287:26.46]Four.
[287:26.56]Number four.
[287:27.96]There it is.
[287:28.86]Pull it out.
[287:30.60]Match it up.
[287:30.90]Get in there.
[287:46.97]Indicate the switch positions switch positions use two three six two three six Right guys, I'm remembering this correctly.
[287:57.43]It's pointless.
[287:58.80]There's no mercy for the likes of you Enter each code and valid okay, Tony Tony one zero zero four Tony Get your key in there
[288:14.31]Correct code.
[288:15.73]151.
[288:15.91]Paul.
[288:20.52]Paul's key.
[288:23.82]And then 10 for Tony.
[288:25.98]Continue procedure.
[288:29.24]Tony, get in there again.
[288:30.42]So, you're the woman who decimated my troops.
[288:34.36]Well, now you're going to die like your foolish father and brother who thought they could ruin my life.
[288:39.31]I need two weapons.
[288:39.95]We need weapons.
[288:41.23]Oh, fuck the weapons.
[288:41.81]You're right.
[288:49.04]Okay, got the laser.
[288:49.78]Great, a laser.
[288:54.16]It can only be used once, so I'd better choose my adversary carefully.
[288:59.88]Empty.
[289:06.34]What's that?
[289:07.56]That's a TV changer beaver.
[289:13.14]Aha, the remote control for the thermostat.
[289:16.91]This should heat things up a little.
[289:19.98]Remote control on the room.
[289:21.20]Nothing.
[289:23.18]As for you, you meddling journalist, you shouldn't have gotten involved.
[289:29.42]You're not capable of doing this.
[289:30.98]Is there another weapon behind here?
[289:33.66]Empty.
[289:34.08]It's the receptor for the remote control I found.
[289:39.54]It must regulate the rooms down the end.
[289:42.82]Maybe I'd better check out the plans.
[289:44.87]It's hard to do that.
[289:47.19]Here we go.
[289:51.99]Fire extinguisher, hit him in the head with it.
[289:55.63]It's nearly empty.
[289:56.61]Got all the weapons.
[289:57.55]There's still a little insecticide left.
[290:00.21]That should be enough for the three roaches after us.
[290:03.09]Okay, here we go.
[290:03.65]Bingo.
[290:04.29]Save game.
[290:06.12]I got plenty of time.
[290:12.26]This one's called I Win.
[290:13.98]Alright, so now... Can I watch what you're doing?
[290:18.66]If you like.
[290:20.47]You just don't realize who you're up against.
[290:22.15]Tony's key goes in.
[290:23.51]I am Len Kvark, the sole survivor of a new order in this dying century.
[290:31.31]So this is Insecticide.
[290:33.07]We got Tony's key ring.
[290:38.22]Nothing.
[290:39.58]What?
[290:42.80]What was wrong with that?
[290:47.28]Ten.
[290:50.07]I need a third key ring.
[290:51.35]How would you like to join my laboratory rats?
[290:54.90]I need some fresh DNA.
[290:58.62]What do you mean third key?
[291:04.16]Get his key.
[291:06.68]This is the other exit marked on the plan.
[291:11.32]I wonder how safe we are here.
[291:13.66]Kevork and his men must be planning to attack.
[291:18.76]I'll be generous if you give yourselves up immediately.
[291:21.46]I have to kill him.
[291:22.34]I'll make sure you don't suffer.
[291:24.68]I've got insecticide and I've got a laser.
[291:29.71]We're going to insecticide the fat guy.
[291:34.11]Use the remote.
[291:36.87]Remote control on what exactly, though?
[291:44.17]Remote control on receiver.
[291:45.53]So do you really believe you can destroy a lifetime of work?
[291:53.76]Nothing.
[291:58.42]This is the other exit marked on the plan.
[292:04.02]Doesn't work.
[292:04.68]Your final hour has come.
[292:07.24]Prepare to die!
[292:11.33]Use the remote control on, when you say thermostat, where do you see that?
[292:18.28]That looks like a thermostat.
[292:19.08]That could be a thermostat.
[292:19.86]That could be a thermostat, but it's not remote on receiver.
[292:22.11]It doesn't do anything.
[292:24.21]Nothing.
[292:25.65]Does it put a battery in the remote?
[292:26.91]Alright, here we go.
[292:31.50]There he is.
[292:32.72]Dead.
[292:43.34]Laser.
[292:46.54]Got him.
[292:48.04]Alright.
[292:48.90]Now... Now what?
[292:51.44]What do I do?
[292:51.86]I don't have any other weapons.
[292:54.21]What do I do?
[292:54.81]Remote control on what?
[292:58.25]What?
[293:07.56]What?
[293:13.77]There's enough insecticide for three people?
[293:16.11]But it wasn't in my list.
[293:26.23]It's alright.
[293:26.57]We got it saved.
[293:31.98]So I got it saved.
[293:33.18]Let me remote control.
[293:36.88]Room number?
[293:37.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[293:39.42]Room number.
[293:41.88]What's the number of this room?
[293:47.31]Does this remember a number?
[293:48.33]Alright, it's hot in here now.
[293:58.85]This is A2.
[293:59.59]And then... Oh!
[294:12.11]I think I've set off an explosion in one of the rooms.
[294:15.56]The solvents stored there obviously didn't appreciate the heat.
[294:20.98]Uh... I wonder how safe we are here.
[294:23.08]Did I explode somebody?
[294:24.08]The Valk and his men must be planning to attack.
[294:26.12]I don't... It was too hot in that room.
[294:34.23]Pocket laser insecticide.
[294:35.89]Um...
[294:40.86]I don't know if I did it.
[294:43.26]How would you like to join my laboratory rats?
[294:46.80]I need some fresh DNA.
[294:49.66]Check the room.
[294:51.26]Is the door going to open?
[294:53.50]Who's there?
[294:54.88]Is the door going to open?
[294:55.84]Exploded room.
[294:57.12]Who's there?
[294:58.02]Okay, I think we're fine.
[295:05.96]Now we just gotta wait.
[295:07.26]Wait it out.
[295:12.24]I'll be generous if you give yourselves up immediately.
[295:14.56]We're almost fucking at the end of this shit.
[295:15.91]I'll make sure you don't suffer.
[295:20.53]Open the door and get on the floor?
[295:23.51]No.
[295:28.91]Here comes the stutter.
[295:30.31]So do you really believe you can destroy a lifetime of work?
[295:35.91]Alright, I'm gonna save it here.
[295:36.73]Because I don't want to do this again.
[295:45.08]Now we just wait until he comes in here.
[295:49.46]Your final hour has come.
[295:52.02]Prepare to die!
[295:53.50]You think this guy would be concerned about the fact that one of his rooms just exploded?
[296:00.54]I gotta be ready.
[296:01.58]I'm gonna switch it up this time.
[296:05.40]I have the weapons.
[296:05.98]Oh yeah, I was ready.
[296:07.56]Pocket laser.
[296:08.67]Come on in.
[296:13.28]Dude, imagine your life's work being ruined like this.
[296:15.72]I said I was gonna do the other way.
[296:19.50]I want to see his other animation.
[296:22.23]That don't- what the fu- It doesn't work on him.
[296:31.59]Why would it not work on him?
[296:37.71]Too far away.
[296:43.38]Your final hour has come.
[296:45.94]Prepare to die.
[296:51.09]Can you imagine not save scumming this game?
[296:55.13]It would be unbearable.
[296:58.93]He's a big boy.
[296:59.91]They can take extra poison.
[297:03.40]Okay, here we go.
[297:04.18]Laser beam.
[297:05.12]Shut up.
[297:05.36]Just Jeremy, do it.
[297:12.85]Here he comes.
[297:14.13]It's me.
[297:14.87]Hi.
[297:15.55]I did it.
[297:22.22]I went.
[297:27.52]Punch in the secret code.
[297:28.72]Give me a kiss.
[297:30.36]He's still alive.
[297:33.84]Ada, look up behind you.
[297:36.84]You shot my wife!
[297:37.86]She's been hit.
[297:39.74]Ada, are you alright?
[297:42.24]Do you want Ada to die?
[297:44.38]After all, she's a criminal.
[297:46.40]Or should she stay alive?
[297:48.48]She did save Max.
[297:49.92]What?
[297:52.09]Why would I... Why do I get to choose this?
[297:59.99]How do I get to choose this?
[298:01.22]Well, OK.
[298:02.86]This is actually pick your ending.
[298:05.96]So go ahead, guys.
[298:07.06]I'm going to leave it up to you.
[298:15.56]We made it through this whole game.
[298:17.16]Might as well, right?
[298:22.99]Let's see what you guys want to do.
[298:29.58]Oh, what a fight.
[298:30.26]This is a big fight.
[298:31.12]50-49.
[298:38.95]50-50.
[298:39.25]Dude, look at all these people throwing punches.
[298:44.59]The internet fight.
[298:50.57]I expect 50 million votes.
[298:51.87]No.
[298:54.10]There are a lot of people here, though.
[298:55.04]Hope you're having a good time.
[298:57.64]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[299:00.43]I have immensely enjoyed this experience, except for the part where you had to put the puzzle together without the mouse.
[299:06.21]What the heck?
[299:10.79]Okay, so this is still going.
[299:17.36]Lives is currently winning with 901 votes.

[300:23.90]Oh, and that's it.
[300:25.12]It was exactly 50-50 when I said at the end.
[300:31.63]That's it.
[300:34.91]That's it.
[300:35.27]She lives.
[300:40.54]We're going to see them both anyways.
[300:42.56]It doesn't fucking matter.
[300:50.42]I just love seeing the chat, like, 10 votes.
[300:53.40]And actually, when I said zero, it was equal amount of votes.
[300:58.40]And then, like, two seconds later, Liv's took it over.
[301:01.80]So, I mean, 50-50, then.
[301:02.90]We're going to see.
[301:03.44]We have to see them both now.
[301:06.03]That's the only fair way.
[301:07.11]It ended at 50-50.
[301:08.67]We have to see them both.
[301:12.95]Thank you for voting.
[301:14.37]Let's just let her live first.
[301:15.81]Save the game right now.
[301:16.97]It's alright.
[301:17.63]Have fun.
[301:26.24]Wait, does that mean I die?
[301:27.30]Alright.
[301:35.48]How many deaths do you have on your conscience, murderer?
[301:38.16]Alright, where's this guy's key?
[301:48.97]Alright, got his key.
[301:52.03]To the console.
[301:55.37]Lev's keyring.
[301:56.31]Stick it in there.
[302:01.59]Thank you very much.
[302:02.73]There is the VHS tape.
[302:05.31]Don't watch it.
[302:05.93]I thought I said she survives.
[302:17.48]Yeah, she's very clearly dead.
[302:19.70]I clicked survive.
[302:22.96]Why would I just walk out?
[302:23.91]Am I pissing?
[302:29.97]Guess who showed up just in time to save my skin on the roof of the research institute?
[302:34.68]The incredible Dee Dee.
[302:36.70]The bulletproof vest he'd been wearing had saved his life when I could have sworn he was riddled with bullets.
[302:42.06]Just goes to show how smart Dee Dee is.
[302:45.28]He told me he'd been suspicious of Ada's undying love right from the start.
[302:49.67]As if it were odd that I should arouse such a sudden undying passion in a lady.
[302:53.93]What the hell?
[302:55.15]Anyway, he'd planted a transmitter in her lipstick as soon as he started to suspect her.
[302:59.88]The signal led him to the research institute.
[303:04.66]I suppose you want to know what happened to our relationship after all that.
[303:07.90]Yes, I do.
[303:08.30]Well, it picked up right where we'd left off.
[303:10.90]Ada was alive, and the ambulance crew was taking care of her.
[303:14.81]She's killed to avenge her family.
[303:17.01]I couldn't hold it against her that she'd rid the planet of two evil crooks.
[303:21.85]He's going to say I'm so sad that she's dead.
[303:23.97]I sent the photos and the file to the people in the right places, and with your cassette, they'll soon get the whole picture.
[303:29.12]Yeah, all the audio fucked up in the game.
[303:30.72]No way.
[303:31.22]They're clearly talking.
[303:32.64]I've got the whole thing worked out.
[303:38.66]What is this?
[303:42.26]The Eraser, Lagrange's trusty henchman, was in charge of all the sensitive missions.
[303:47.40]His boss ordered him to follow you day and night.
[303:50.41]He was the one that shot at me instead of you once he traced you to my dump, thanks to the bugged glasses.
[303:56.77]What's this for?
[303:58.59]In case you've not... Why do we need to know this?
[304:01.45]Lagrange was the politician in the group.
[304:04.26]Kvork, who had detected his unscrupulous nature, brought him to the organization because he was politically high enough to suppress any legal action taken against the elite.
[304:13.90]Lagrange had contacted Marcos in the hope of buying arms for his collection.
[304:18.18]He then introduced Marcos to Kvork, thinking his trafficking skills would be useful.
[304:22.92]Ada killed him just before you found him in his office at the pool hall.
[304:29.21]Do I have to exit, like, alt F for the game?
[304:32.71]Yeah, that's it.
[304:35.90]That closes the game.
[304:41.86]That's it.
[304:44.42]We won.
[304:45.22]The game exited the desktop.
[304:48.96]OK.
[304:51.81]Well, let's see what happens if she dies.
[304:58.73]Shit.
[305:01.65]I've always been a little absent-minded.
[305:03.21]I'm not sure if I got it from my honorable forefathers, or maybe there was just a bad planetary alignment the day I was born.
[305:10.68]I still have no idea what happened in this whole game.
[305:12.42]This nearly cost me my life several times.
[305:15.78]The last time it happened, I'd gone to see Tony Mo- What was it, just in case?
[305:25.33]I win?
[305:28.39]What was the one right before?
[305:32.38]Yeah, I don't know anything that happened in the whole game.
[305:38.88]I swear to God, I don't know anything.
[305:40.78]No, I didn't.
[305:43.24]Remote control.
[305:44.36]I think I need to do this again.
[305:45.34]Yeah.
[305:49.54]Okay.
[305:54.69]Blow it up.
[305:58.72]Just in case it's closer.
[306:01.42]Yeah, it's right here.
[306:02.18]Yeah, so we blow up the room.
[306:02.98]Not his voice again.
[306:04.10]I'm sorry.
[306:04.32]This is the only way we can see the other ending.
[306:06.66]The computer's all done.
[306:07.20]If you like.
[306:23.80]He's done.
[306:24.40]He's ready.
[306:24.82]He just needs the key.
[306:26.47]I have the insecticide.
[306:27.85]Oh, wait.
[306:29.09]No, no.
[306:29.43]I did lock you in.
[306:30.27]Hold on.
[306:30.55]You guys are right.
[306:32.83]You guys are right.
[306:34.91]Just in case is right here.
[306:36.25]Look at that.
[306:36.61]Right at the very end.
[306:37.19]Okay.
[306:37.43]Now, RC has been activated.
[306:38.57]Exploded room.
[306:40.23]I'm ready.
[306:40.55]Here we go.
[306:47.69]Your final hour has come.
[306:49.15]Prepare to die.
[306:50.31]It must be ADR for the English version of the game.
[306:54.67]Because the game was made in France.
[306:56.27]Ah, that makes a lot more sense than they ran out of... Like, they budget for audio.
[307:01.12]Or the guy fucking didn't run tape.
[307:03.30]That's way more of a... Likely scenario.
[307:06.04]33 is right at the end?
[307:15.64]Is it?
[307:32.51]No, no, no, no.
[307:35.09]He's crawling.
[307:36.35]Ada, watch out behind you.
[307:37.95]Duck.
[307:39.17]Ada, you're right.
[307:43.00]Just, Ada.
[307:45.44]Do you want Ada to die?
[307:47.04]I love this.
[307:47.54]After all, she's a criminal.
[307:49.58]Or should she stay alive?
[307:51.66]She did save Max.
[307:53.06]This shit doesn't even matter.
[307:54.78]No, please, please don't die.
[307:58.12]Take too many risks, Ada.
[308:00.74]I swear the truth will get out.
[308:02.43]You can count on me.
[308:04.19]I swear.
[308:04.67]Rest in peace, Ada.
[308:16.83]That's it?
[308:18.03]That's it.
[308:19.10]That's it.
[308:19.58]Rest in peace, Ada.
[308:23.02]So because her eyes were open in the last one, that means she's alive.
[308:29.72]Alright, so what about the other end?
[308:31.48]Did we get saved by somebody else here?
[308:32.83]Let's see what happens.
[308:41.99]Give us the same monolog.
[308:45.48]I'm getting a chunk warning here on my scum VM.
[308:51.64]I'm getting a she- There's like warning, warning, warning, warning.
[308:56.70]No, that's the same thing.
[308:57.48]Her eyes are open on this one too.
[309:05.41]Nice relaxing clay piss.
[309:09.36]I feel really good.
[309:10.91]I was really dehydrated.
[309:12.19]The incredible Dee Dee.
[309:16.19]The bulletproof vest he'd been wearing had saved his life when I could have sworn he was riddled with bullets.
[309:22.01]Just goes to show how smart Dee Dee is.
[309:24.70]He told me he'd been suspicious of Ada's undying love right from the start.
[309:28.18]I don't even like Dee Dee.
[309:29.10]I didn't have a chance to know who he was.
[309:31.94]This is supposed to be some big reveal at the end of the game.
[309:34.18]Whoa, Dee Dee's alive!
[309:35.80]I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[309:39.31]The signal led him to the research institute.
[309:45.95]How can you not like... Dee Dee.
[309:49.01]He was the best character.
[309:52.98]So what had become of Ada?
[309:55.30]Justice had been done.
[309:57.21]Her father and brother had been avenged.
[310:00.33]Now she could rest in peace.
[310:04.15]Don't worry.
[310:04.59]You'll be cleared.
[310:05.57]I sent the photos in the file to the people in the right places.
[310:08.21]And with your cassette, they'll soon get the whole picture.
[310:10.57]Now, if you want to know the finer details of the affair, just ask me.
[310:13.25]33% for those who missed it?
[310:13.89]I've got the whole thing worked out.
[310:15.31]What do you mean, for those who missed it?
[310:18.36]Lagrange was the politician in the group.
[310:21.16]Kvork, who had detected his unscrupulous nature, brought him to the organization because he was politically high enough to suppress any legal action taken against the elite.
[310:30.59]Lagrange had contacted Marcos in the hope of buying arms for his collection.
[310:35.09]He then introduced Marcos to Kvork, thinking his trafficking skills would be useful.
[310:39.86]Ada killed him just before you found him in his office at the pool hall.
[310:46.11]I can't, I can't, I can't... That's all folks!
[310:55.30]Hold on.
[310:58.78]33% for the true end.
[311:01.58]Okay.
[311:06.87]I've always been a little absent-minded.
[311:09.11]I'm not sure if I got it from my honorable forefathers or maybe there was just a bad planetary alignment the day I was born.
[311:16.30]What do you guys want me to do?
[311:17.20]Go to 33%.
[311:17.36]Load 33%.
[311:18.48]Oh, this is why.
[311:18.96]There.
[311:19.08]Ah, close, but no cigar.
[311:36.33]And one, and two, and three.
[311:39.22]Gather round now, the watch is free.
[311:40.92]The cards are straight.
[311:41.76]Follow that queen.
[311:42.70]Follow that diamond queen.
[311:43.84]Eight of clubs.
[311:45.92]Where's the queen?
[311:46.96]Seven of spades.
[311:47.50]Where's the queen?
[311:48.74]Maybe that... No.
[311:51.23]That's it.
[312:01.86]That's the end.
[312:02.68]That's the end of the game.
[312:05.45]And that is also the end of the stream.
[312:13.78]I wonder where that little lady is now.
[312:16.72]Where's that queen?
[312:20.43]That is it, guys.
[312:24.19]Have a great rest of your night.
[312:25.27]If you're taking off right now, thanks for hanging out.
[312:27.03]A lot of people were here tonight, so... Hope you had fun.
[312:31.30]That was an experience.
[312:36.16]That was an experience.
[312:40.90]So, the next stream, we are not streaming tomorrow.
[312:45.58]We're gonna do a... I'm gonna probably stream on Friday.
[312:52.92]But Saturday is... I'm gonna drink and do the Labo.
[312:59.61]The Robot Labo is still back here.
[313:01.05]We're doing that Saturday night.
[313:02.47]I'm just gonna drink a bunch of fucking whiskey and build it.
[313:07.78]So that's how we can get through that one.
[313:09.84]That's going to be a long stream.
[313:11.29]Strap yourself in for that one.
[313:15.24]Oh no, not the Labo.
[313:20.90]We talked about this before.
[313:22.24]First Labo stream from a couple weeks ago, I had a few drinks and I was like, wow, this is so amazing!
[313:28.22]This is so much fun!
[313:29.68]Everyone's having such a good time!
[313:32.06]And then the second Labo stream, everybody wanted to delete my Twitch channel from the internet.
[313:37.20]Because it was so boring, apparently.
[313:39.06]And I didn't realize it because I was drinking the last stream, the last Labo stream, so I thought everyone apparently was still telling me during that stream
[313:48.18]while I was drinking that, dude, get the fuck, stop doing Labo.
[313:51.18]This sucks.
[313:52.28]And I was just like drinking and shit face.
[313:53.94]So I didn't even know it was happening.
[313:55.08]I thought everyone was having a great time.
[313:56.42]So I have to drink again to play Labo so I can like pretend in my head that, wow, this is such a great stream.
[314:01.89]It's not boring.
[314:09.90]Just tune in, man.
[314:10.70]I'm gonna smash one of them.
[314:11.94]Don't you understand?
[314:12.86]We're gonna build the robot.
[314:13.98]I'm gonna accidentally, like, punch through my window with glass and get, like, glass shards in my hand.
[314:18.58]Don't miss it.
[314:19.14]You're not gonna miss that stream?
[314:24.83]No, I'm not gonna smash it.
[314:25.73]It's too much money.
[314:27.37]These things are too expensive.
[314:30.67]I lost a shitload of viewers.
[314:33.53]I'm gonna make it interesting this time.
[314:36.24]I'll put a blindfold on for half of it.
[314:38.36]I'm gonna drink...
[314:41.85]I'll get on speakerphone with a famous person.
[314:45.16]A famous person might be on that stream.
[314:50.00]I can't say that.
[314:50.56]That's not real.
[314:51.82]That's not going to fucking happen.
[314:52.68]There's not going to be a famous person on the stream.
[314:59.83]Getting wasted on grain alcohol and playing with cardboard.
[315:02.51]But that's Saturday.
[315:03.73]Friday we'll do something.
[315:05.83]We'll figure something out for Friday.
[315:07.89]But...
[315:09.32]Friday, Saturday, and then, like I said, it's gonna get hectic here.
[315:16.96]I'm gonna have to take like a week off soon to get the house shit situated.
[315:24.07]But you know, that's pretty much, that's pretty much it.
[315:31.17]So, check my phone, look at the weather, and let's go through the credits.

[318:33.16]Thank you for the continued
[318:35.79]support on this stream.
[318:37.91]You guys are awesome.
[318:43.14]Now let's get to the bits.
[318:44.06]What do you say?
[318:44.68]Bits, bits, bits, bits.
[318:47.92]Thank you to Peter for the $3.
[318:49.42]Great stream so far.
[318:50.32]Thanks, Peter.
[318:52.64]Thanks for the $2.
[318:53.20]He said, I made this.
[318:58.79]Did you, though?
[319:00.05]If you did, hey.
[319:01.91]Look at that.
[319:02.77]I made this.
[319:03.47]Atrolux made that.
[319:05.05]$2.
[319:05.07]Thank you, dude, so much.
[319:06.99]Sharkman.
[319:07.91]Look at this dude.
[319:08.49]I don't know if we should be looking at Sharkman, though.
[319:13.51]Maybe have a look at his teeth.
[319:20.15]Is the shark considered a dude?
[319:24.18]Or is it like a fish?
[319:28.33]What do you mean screen?
[319:30.57]Oh, you guys, you're right.
[319:32.55]And when you're right, you're right.
[319:38.89]But thank you.
[319:40.31]Thank you to NoCliff.
[319:43.84]NoCLF for the $3.
[319:45.16]Fuck Comcast.
[319:47.60]I agree.
[319:49.14]I agree.
[319:49.58]They tend to do stupid things to the streams.
[319:53.66]But thank you, Atchalux.
[319:54.86]Nice shirt.
[319:56.73]Thank you, Killcode, for the $1.
[319:58.27]Don't know if you're reading bits from last stream or not, but I just want to say again that last stream was the hardest I've ever laughed at a Twitch stream.
[320:04.78]Thank you for that.
[320:05.32]Also, Germafireman.
[320:07.54]Thanks, dude.
[320:09.02]Yeah, that was real weird.
[320:10.78]I don't know why that just fucking turned off.
[320:15.55]But unfortunately, I cannot pull back all the bit comments.
[320:22.83]But thank you, everybody that gives any money to this stream.
[320:26.65]Thank you.
[320:29.23]It always irritates me when stuff like that happens and I lose.
[320:32.13]Oh, fuck all the subs that came through.
[320:33.59]Oh, the stream just turned off.
[320:34.93]My internet died.
[320:35.73]Oh, well, see you later.
[320:36.77]Bye.
[320:37.13]Thanks for the money.
[320:38.97]I hate that shit, so.
[320:41.71]Just know it's not my intention.
[320:43.80]And I appreciate any amount of money that people have ever given me.
[320:47.26]Subs or bits of the like, you know.
[320:52.58]But thank you.
[320:54.63]Thank you also to Sly161 for the $1 FMV games.
[320:57.79]PogChamp, Toonstruck might be a cool one for you to stream.
[321:02.85]Takes place in a cartoon world and stars FMV Christopher Lloyd along with a celebrity voice cast.
[321:09.08]It is a fun little game.
[321:10.10]Yes, it is.
[321:12.12]I have played Toonstruck before from its completion to its completion.
[321:19.19]more than once so although it's a great game it would be fun on stream I don't think I would play it on stream just because I know everything about it I've played it through all the way to completion long time ago but thank you for the suggestion uh max g shep thanks for the two bucks say hi to easy Pete when you go to new Vegas I'll look for him but thank you max
[321:47.43]At your looks, again, thanks for the $1.
[321:48.89]Here's some gas money for the move.
[321:50.29]Use it wisely.
[321:52.47]I wonder how much it's... Here's the thing.
[321:55.63]I'm still kind of undecided on how I'm going to go to Las Vegas.
[322:01.68]Because this is what's been so odd and so hard to deal with.
[322:06.98]Real talk wise.
[322:09.84]I've got a shitload of stuff.
[322:12.52]And there are so many different ways to do this.
[322:17.57]I either have to get rid of all my stuff and fly there or pay a company to move it or drive it myself with uh a u-haul but driving to Vegas I don't even know if I fucking want to do that man that's like 47 hours of driving that's
[322:41.66]that's gonna take like more than a week you have to sleep still I can't do 10 hour days driving I can't do it but then the problem with getting rid of all my stuff right so I have a computer I have more than one computer this computer right here is what am I just going to ship this to myself there's companies that you can fill a little cube you can fill a box up 48 hours equals more than a week
[323:07.85]Well, you're going to drive for 24 straight hours?
[323:12.72]No, you're going to drive for like six, take a break, hang out, drive for three, go to sleep.
[323:23.18]48 hours on the road ends up being about at least three or four days.
[323:28.35]At least.
[323:29.79]If you're trying to just go as crazy as you can and drive for like 10 hours a day.
[323:36.51]wait no I meant less I meant less I was gonna say it's I don't know if you guys have ever done a long drive before it gets to a point where after four to seven hours on the road you kind of want to just go crazy you just your brain just starts to meld the highways together and stuff and I don't know if I'm willing to do that for more than four or five days
[324:04.00]But then also I got auto.
[324:05.54]I have a dog that bringing on an airplane is so stressful for an animal.
[324:09.92]It's just sucks.
[324:11.38]You got to stuff them in a fucking little bag and push them under the seat.
[324:14.43]Like, I don't want to do that shit.
[324:16.75]I really don't want to do that.
[324:19.41]And I think I was trying to look into like buying a plane ticket for him.
[324:30.31]But that doesn't matter.
[324:31.39]I looked into it.
[324:31.97]Like, if I bought a plane ticket for Otto, it... No, it doesn't matter.
[324:36.93]He still has to go under the seat.
[324:38.78]What?
[324:43.10]Why are we... In 2018, are we really still at this point where, like, yeah, just put the dog in a bag and stuff him under the fucking seat?
[324:53.95]Like, really?
[324:59.07]That's such horseshit.
[325:04.28]But that's another thing I have to think about in getting him down there safely and comfortably.
[325:10.60]First class for Otto?
[325:13.91]You know what?
[325:14.47]That's not a bad idea.
[325:15.43]But holy shit, man.
[325:16.37]First class is like two grand.
[325:18.69]That's so much money.
[325:20.81]I could like... First class is such a fucking ripoff, by the way.
[325:30.91]$2,000 to sit in a glorified lazy boy on a plane?
[325:37.75]What?
[325:39.59]Well, you see, sir, this seat is like a shitty... It's like a lazy boy from the 90s.
[325:46.96]And it reclines a little bit more.
[325:49.88]And there's not anybody sitting right next to you.
[325:53.32]But then, you know, that's about... That's like $1,700 more dollars worth of... It's worth it.
[325:59.88]What the fuck are you talking about?
[326:07.58]And then here's another thing though.
[326:10.22]If you, on JetBlue, JetBlue has bigger, much more leg room.
[326:16.61]And JetBlue's exit aisles,
[326:19.80]I think they're in the sixth or seventh row of the plane.
[326:22.78]There's a huge space in the front, and I'm curious if I get in one of those exit row seats, that auto can kind of just hang out where that huge space is.
[326:37.29]And by the way, just in case anybody is curious, if you ever go on a plane trip,
[326:43.44]honestly if you need to fly jet blue or really any plane you you want that exit row you want that one that has like the huge amount of leg room in front of you it's like a giant open space there's a little uh travel hack there for you make a road trip out of it with a Kim that's yeah that's what we're talking about I'm just not so sure I'm up for across the country drive
[327:08.82]What if Otto needs to go to the bathroom?
[327:11.06]It's not that long of a plane ride.
[327:13.30]He would go before... He would go pee and poo before we got on the plane.
[327:17.76]And then he would be good.
[327:19.36]It's only like a five and a half hour plane ride.
[327:21.98]Not that long.
[327:25.64]You'd be surprised how interesting a road trip can be.
[327:28.62]That's true, but also on top of that, if I'm going to drive, I'm going to bring a bunch of shit with me.
[327:33.07]So it won't really be...
[327:35.43]Let's go and do all this stuff with like a fucking u-haul I Don't know if I let's go see the sights and like drive around like a big fucking awkward truck You need more than two people to take shifts driving that's another thing splitting it between two people You have to be prepared for emergencies
[328:05.02]yeah I'm gonna fly I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make it so auto doesn't have to be put under a seat or something no way auto is your third
[328:20.62]Yeah, you can pay a company to deliver it in a truck.
[328:22.98]You can pay a company to put it in a cube.
[328:25.24]It is like $2,000 to $4,000.
[328:27.02]So it is thousands of dollars to have anything shipped across the country.
[328:32.97]It's fucking like two or three grand.
[328:35.99]So unfortunately, every one of these options has a massive downside.
[328:44.19]Flying is the most likely, but flying means I have to get rid of all of my stuff.
[328:48.92]How am I going to get my computer out there?
[328:51.58]Check a bag?
[328:52.54]I don't want to put my computer into a bag and have some dude just check it and throw it in the back of the plane.
[329:01.61]All things need to be considered, but regardless, we can sit here and talk about that for hours.
[329:08.29]You can ship the computer.
[329:11.08]That's true, but how much does it cost to ship a huge computer like this?
[329:14.40]Is it even...
[329:16.48]Is that going to cost like $500, $600, $700?
[329:18.04]A few hundred?
[329:19.12]I mean, this computer is huge.
[329:30.21]I don't know.
[329:30.53]We'll see.
[329:32.49]It'd be more to buy a new computer.
[329:36.28]Take it apart?
[329:36.90]That's not a bad idea.
[329:38.04]I didn't even think about that.
[329:41.80]Take all the parts out.
[329:45.65]Huh.
[329:46.55]And then put them in a series of backpacks.
[329:52.69]I'm going to be smuggling a person's body and all their organs through security.
[329:58.72]Think about that.
[329:59.30]Like, oh yeah, like my computer.
[330:00.90]No, like take out all of his guts and put them around different bags.
[330:07.85]Genuinely clever.
[330:15.79]No, I'm talking about like a computer, a computer.
[330:21.48]No, no, a computer, a computer.
[330:24.90]I just had to make the analogy because it's like, I'm separating the total mass of, you know, I've said something stupid and what am I supposed to do?
[330:39.10]I'm sorry, I was talking about a computer
[330:44.68]Back off.
[330:45.12]Give him the smoke.
[330:51.39]I missed Super Spy Burger sub.
[330:53.21]What the fuck?
[330:53.79]How could I?
[330:57.51]Eight cores in a duffel bag.
[331:09.02]That was perfect.
[331:10.02]Perfect joke.
[331:15.05]Add your camera and microphone to your specs?
[331:18.41]Oh shit, you're right.
[331:19.57]I mean, my webcam sucks.
[331:22.61]I use like a shitty Logitech webcam.
[331:24.71]I don't even think it's... It's embarrassing to write this down.
[331:27.93]The microphone on the other hand... It is a Newman TLM-102.
[331:40.91]Guys, you still have a... Look, I've been talking for like six hours, okay?
[331:46.90]Voice cracks, that's just my throat's been utilized too much and it needs to be lubricated and rested.
[331:58.10]Xbox headset mic.
[332:06.45]Alright, I gotta move on.
[332:09.75]But thank you.
[332:11.53]Thank you to Frexter.
[332:15.71]Thanks for the $1.
[332:16.55]God, I love these old FMV games.
[332:18.07]I do too.
[332:19.57]I wish there were more.
[332:20.21]Thank you, Naughty Gnome, for the $1.
[332:21.33]Did you ever finish Hollow Knight off stream?
[332:24.12]And how was it?
[332:24.94]How was the final boss?
[332:26.00]I have not.
[332:27.02]But thank the lucky stars here.
[332:29.50]It is now on the Switch, the Nintendo Switch.
[332:32.76]So I can take... Got a long plane ride coming up.
[332:35.50]Alright.
[332:39.44]I might play through the whole thing on the Switch.
[332:42.74]At my leisure.
[332:45.26]See me after class in like three months.
[332:49.20]Thank you, Naughty Gnome.
[332:49.80]Thank you to Gabe DeGrossi for the $5.
[332:51.46]Hey, Jerma.
[332:52.22]Long time no bits.
[332:52.96]Been strapped for cash.
[332:53.92]His work is being a bitch to me.
[332:56.91]Anyways, keep up what you do.
[332:58.03]You're still amazing.
[332:58.79]Much love.
[332:59.27]Thank you, Gabe DeGrossi.
[333:02.67]Sorry to hear about your work troubles.
[333:04.87]Keep in mind, you are under no obligation to ever give me money.
[333:08.39]So,
[333:12.49]You just said it's not that long.
[333:15.11]Well, remember, I have to go out to Vegas twice.
[333:19.19]I'm not just going there once.
[333:20.35]If I'm flying out there to Vegas, which is a five-and-a-half-hour plane ride, I'm coming back.
[333:26.30]So that's 11 hours going there and back.
[333:30.02]And then, again, to actually go move everything, to move out there, is another five-and-a-half hours.
[333:37.64]I can beat that game in 20 hours.
[333:44.12]But thank you so much, Gabe DeGrossi.
[333:46.62]Take care of yourself.
[333:51.52]FantasticPhoenix, thanks for the two bucks.
[333:54.72]Part one out of three.
[333:56.40]Oh, I see here.
[333:56.92]So two, three, four, five.
[333:58.52]Thank you, FantasticPhoenix, for the five total dollars here.
[334:01.88]Thanks, man.
[334:03.20]And you say, hey, Jerma, I don't know how much space I have to write this, but I want to tell you that I think you are so talented and beautiful.
[334:08.88]Beautiful.
[334:09.82]You hear that, guys?
[334:11.86]Interesting.
[334:13.11]I used to watch your TF2 content with my friend over Skype back in 2013, and we would always get so excited to see you made a new video.
[334:20.68]You're hilarious.
[334:21.34]I love your humor so much.
[334:23.22]Your humor so much, and I'm so happy that I'm able to watch and participate in your streams weekly.
[334:28.65]I've noticed you're pretty self-conscious sometimes, so I want to tell you that you deserve everything.
[334:34.27]You criticize yourself pretty harshly sometimes, but I feel you are way too hard on yourself.
[334:39.49]Look at all you've achieved.
[334:41.13]You've created an amazing community of people who stick around just to be with you and appreciate what you make.
[334:46.43]All of us here watch and follow you for a reason.
[334:48.98]I feel that God put you on this Earth to share your beautiful personality with the world.
[334:53.26]Don't take it for granted.
[334:55.68]And finally, you work so hard to produce the amazing content you do.
[334:58.82]Your work ethic is incredible.
[335:02.12]You're such a talented human and you deserve the world.
[335:07.14]We all love you so much.
[335:08.16]I look forward to seeing you gain the recognition that you deserve.
[335:10.66]Hope you have a great day, big boy.
[335:14.50]That... Thank you.
[335:19.06]Thank you so much.
[335:21.66]That's an immensely fucking inspiring thing for me to read.
[335:24.49]Because it makes me want to work harder.
[335:29.29]Keep in mind, right?
[335:30.87]When you talk about, like, criticizing and so harsh on yourself.
[335:34.99]I feel like I...
[335:37.12]you need to stay grounded, right?
[335:38.24]I feel like I have to ground myself a lot.
[335:41.96]And it's a, it's, I don't really not criticizing myself.
[335:47.26]I'm not trying to be harsh on myself, but I want to be better.
[335:54.32]I want to be fun to watch.
[335:56.42]I want that to be a thing.
[335:59.72]And I will try as hard as I can to make that a reality.
[336:05.66]I don't want to become somebody that just phones it in for money.
[336:12.10]That doesn't give a fuck.
[336:14.18]That just doesn't matter what they're doing.
[336:16.94]They don't care as long as they're doing it.
[336:20.70]You get complacent.
[336:21.46]You just don't give a shit.
[336:22.66]I don't want to do that.
[336:28.97]Now obviously there's going to be a lot of times when I'm like, oh no!
[336:34.56]I'm not going to do a bunch of weird shit, but there's a time and place for a lot of it, right?
[336:41.14]Look at the last couple of streams, right?
[336:42.36]Like today, we just played this FMV game and just hung out.
[336:47.40]But that doesn't mean I'm going to try to do other things.
[336:52.90]So being harsh on myself is a way to keep me motivated.
[337:00.30]So I don't
[337:02.70]Just take it for granted.
[337:03.56]That I don't just do it for fucking no reason.
[337:10.53]That's pretty much it.
[337:13.85]But thank you.
[337:16.09]FantasticPhoenix, that was an incredibly nice thing to say.
[337:20.81]I'm just glad you're having a good time.
[337:25.90]Hope you continue to.
[337:29.86]Thank you.

[338:07.01]P337R.
[338:07.53]He keeps calling me cool guy.
[338:12.66]Thank you.
[338:14.58]I think you're a cool guy.
[338:16.30]Thanks, dude.
[338:17.20]I'm not being condescending.
[338:18.36]I get memed a lot.
[338:21.56]I don't know.
[338:23.18]People, you know, get them to say it, get them to say the thing.
[338:25.82]I don't know.
[338:26.38]Sometimes I need to be sure.
[338:31.82]Thank you so much, P337R, for the $3 and calling me cool.
[338:35.84]Appreciate it.
[338:37.71]Hey, Moosky, thanks for the $10.
[338:38.73]No message.
[338:39.61]This $10.
[338:40.47]Thank you, Moosky.
[338:43.09]Thank you so much.
[338:45.27]Ginta, thank you for the $5, Ginta.
[338:48.68]I don't know who this killer is, but can he be added to the Jerma Rumble?
[338:54.48]Don't you guys know that it's a rule that every video game that is completed on this stream, at least one or two characters is in the next Rumble?
[339:03.00]That's a rule.
[339:05.56]That held our attention to the end.
[339:09.14]It deserves a participant.
[339:12.48]It's a rule.
[339:15.84]hole of one zombie thanks for the one dollar did you ever have these games when you were a kid I had missed also did you ever have an amiga I did not have an amiga I did have missed though all those old weird games point and clicks uh I'm trying to think of some of the old ones I mean the neverhood is one that's an old point and click
[339:41.43]Not necessarily FMV, but tech kind of is.
[339:45.07]It's all stop motion with a camera.
[339:48.16]And there's full motion video cutscenes.
[339:50.40]It's a great game.
[339:52.90]The Neverhood is one of my favorite games ever made.
[339:55.58]Came out in 1995.
[340:00.73]But yes, some of them did launch when I was a kid.
[340:05.73]The Coldest Fridge.
[340:06.79]Thank you.
[340:07.31]Dun, dun, dun.
[340:15.27]uh thank you dude appreciate it yeah alright I'm gonna make sure I say it again I just make sure I say it one more time because I sometimes it up too uh the new uh the the post has been moved some people I think may have not heard about it uh it is 100 bits to uh have the message be read I want to make sure I
[340:41.92]Make it clear.
[340:43.42]Because I did only say it like once or twice.
[340:51.75]It's to combat the lengthy end and some potential spam.
[340:58.31]So it is $1.
[340:58.77]I'm going to make sure I get that.
[341:01.41]A greedy streamer.
[341:04.37]Come on.
[341:06.56]Can you think of some most streamers
[341:12.37]Most streamers on this platform, some of them, it's like $3 or $4 to get read on stream.
[341:20.68]So you're going to give me the flack for $1?
[341:29.10]Most streamers don't have to deal with Garfield.
[341:33.29]It's mostly five and up.
[341:39.53]Somebody on YouTube requires $50 to read a donation.
[341:45.17]That's fucking insane.
[341:47.49]Do people pay it?
[341:50.12]Now, I'm not talking shit to any streamers.
[341:52.64]I'm just making a statement that I have a very low price of entry.
[342:01.07]Look, it might have to increase because I understand why.
[342:05.37]If you read everything at a certain amount of money, let's say as the channel grows or as channels grow, you might get a thousand messages in a day.
[342:19.47]I don't get that, but if you're one of these larger channels that have to put a $4 or $5 wall down, I can understand that that would be impossible.
[342:30.94]You wouldn't be able to have a stream.
[342:37.83]some people can't afford one dollar that's that's true most just have tts that encourages spam I don't want tts I think it ruins streams I have like the game already talks over me and I already talk over the game I really don't need a third person here talking over me talking over the game no
[343:04.95]And I understand, I know TTS absolutely prints money.
[343:10.03]It does.
[343:11.19]I'm certain of it.
[343:13.65]But, no.
[343:15.15]I wouldn't be able to handle it.
[343:16.31]I wouldn't be able to take it.
[343:22.59]But anyways, yeah.
[343:23.31]Sorry that, I mean, I think a lot of people may not have been aware of it.
[343:26.41]Just bringing it up again.
[343:27.27]100 bits to be read at the end of the stream.
[343:32.04]And I cannot guarantee that it might go higher.
[343:36.22]It could go lower.
[343:37.22]I don't know.
[343:37.54]It depends.
[343:40.20]I don't know.
[343:41.35]I'm just trying to keep it as simple as I can here.
[343:48.47]But, anyways.
[343:49.79]Thank you.
[343:50.35]Two.
[343:55.87]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[343:57.41]The guy chasing me has a gun.
[343:59.65]I better run like I shit myself a little bit.
[344:07.10]For a guy that's supposed to be running very well.
[344:11.00]Thank you to Feitoru.
[344:13.94]Feitoru, thank you for the $1.
[344:15.98]Welcome back.
[344:18.11]Hey Jeremy, is it too late for Wasp edits to still be funny?
[344:22.61]Both times I've tried to link this, their respective streams were cut short.
[344:26.37]Hopefully I'm not somehow jinxing the stream.
[344:29.27]No, I told you, every single fucking Wasp video has to be watched on stream.
[344:35.07]If you link me a Wasp video in a message here, in like a bit message, I have to play it.
[344:42.80]No exceptions.
[344:48.74]So let's watch it.
[344:58.35]Okay.
[344:59.06]Let's get it.
[345:03.04]So I think the thing about going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[345:08.26]Oh, shit.
[345:09.76]Hold on.
[345:10.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[345:10.34]Hold on.
[345:11.87]Wait till he lands.
[345:13.19]Wait till he lands.
[345:15.93]OK, he landed.
[345:29.84]Up in smoke See that look at these PogChamps
[346:05.12]Some of the shit you guys come up with.
[346:07.16]Honest to God.
[346:11.50]That was fucking perfect.
[346:15.92]For those of you that want the link, here it is.
[346:24.68]I gotta get it.
[346:25.94]There it is.
[346:28.38]So I think the thing about... Here's a link to that video.
[346:31.62]I think going on a diet, it's not...
[346:35.10]Thank you for that, Fatoru.
[346:37.72]That was perfect.
[346:40.11]Huge girl.
[346:40.95]Thank you, huge girl, for the $10.
[346:44.13]Jerma, please read my phone number on stream.
[346:47.19]No.
[346:49.65]I know it's a fake number, but no, I ain't going to do that.
[346:53.27]I'll give you one number in here.
[346:54.39]How's that sound?
[346:55.01]Read my phone number.
[346:56.15]Okay, I'll read a number from this.
[346:58.55]It is number one.
[347:00.69]That's it.
[347:01.73]Huge girl.
[347:02.31]I'm sorry.
[347:02.73]I don't know what this is.
[347:03.79]I ain't going to read it.
[347:06.42]Thank you for the $10.
[347:07.80]I really appreciate it.
[347:11.18]But I don't, I am not reading it.
[347:12.66]I don't care if it's fake.
[347:19.69]Hey, spec tag.
[347:20.63]Thank you for the $1.
[347:21.71]Hey, Jeremy.
[347:22.23]I think you could try doing a buddy stream with tag at some point.
[347:25.78]I think it would be fun to watch.
[347:28.20]He says tag cat.
[347:31.32]Uh,
[347:33.12]yeah I mean I don't remember I told you guys about like multiplayer and playing with people like oh you should play with this guy play with this person no you should play with this person it's just it just organically sometimes will happen local streamer calls out ninja what are you talking about when did I call out ninja
[348:06.60]When did that happen?
[348:08.10]Because you're talking about the money thing.
[348:14.60]No, you're not calling back to that now.
[348:22.61]I'm not doxing anybody.
[348:23.93]I didn't do anything.
[348:26.97]I didn't call him out.
[348:32.94]I stay away from that kind of shit on this stream.
[348:35.45]We talk about cats.
[348:37.11]We talk about like throwing up on your food.
[348:39.51]We talk about like driving around.
[348:41.33]I don't talk about that kind of stuff.
[348:43.85]But anyways.
[348:45.85]Yeah, because I made the comment about people putting that, but that was not supposed to be a dig at anybody.
[348:54.76]It was a general statement.
[348:56.20]But anyways, Tag is a really cool guy.
[348:59.16]to go forward to talk about the actual message that just came in.
[349:02.62]We're talking about a message that just came in, not something we talked about five minutes ago, guys.
[349:08.17]Can we get with the program here?
[349:12.05]Tag is a really cool guy.
[349:15.87]I would, absolutely, if, you know, we're in the right place, right time, right game, absolutely.
[349:27.30]But thank you, SpecTag.
[349:30.98]By the way, I love how your name is Spektag.
[349:34.44]Hey, it's me, Spektag.
[349:36.66]I think you should play with tag at some point.
[349:41.36]You got similar names.
[349:48.11]But that's not a joke.
[349:49.33]I'm not making a joke.
[349:50.25]I'm just making a small reference to that.
[349:53.13]I'm saying, hey, your name is similar and you want to play.
[349:56.33]It's not a joke.
[349:57.27]I didn't say I'm going to make a joke.
[350:00.23]Alright.
[350:00.61]Alright.
[350:00.97]Alright.
[350:01.27]Okay.
[350:01.83]Alright.
[350:02.31]Thank you.
[350:05.57]Thank you, SpeckTag.
[350:07.34]Thank you, WildHabuddy, for the $1.
[350:08.42]Why is every FMV game so goddamn weird?
[350:11.48]I can't think of one that is not weird.
[350:14.70]But you have to be really weird to make one.
[350:24.10]You got to be really odd in the first place to want to make one of these.
[350:30.55]But thank you, Peter, P337R, for the $3.
[350:35.46]He puts down this.
[350:36.38]I thought this was Tracer's pants.
[350:46.47]But that is, in fact, a glass is clanging.
[350:49.75]So thank you for the $3.
[350:51.03]Appreciate that.
[350:56.81]thank you Peter and ding that's what he says thank you d Jack for the one dollar I haven't given bits for a while hi this game ended up way longer than I expected now the game's only like five hours though it's like a four to five hour experience that's pretty short that's not that long I knew I was gonna be able to get it done when I went at the progress bar say in 60 50 we were gaining like four or five percent every 10 minutes I figured it'd be easy
[351:33.30]But thank you, D-Jack.
[351:34.30]Thank you, Shotgun Shogun, for the $1.
[351:36.02]Appreciate it.
[351:37.64]Roll Dog, thanks for the $1.
[351:38.74]They say Max.
[351:40.94]Thank you.
[351:42.72]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $1.
[351:44.28]You are really close.
[351:46.30]That's Twitch Clip.
[351:47.91]Close, you're really close, you're really close, you're really close, you're really close.
[351:51.93]Oh, goddammit, he died.
[351:53.99]Close, you're really close, you're really close, you're really close, you're really close.
[351:58.03]Oh, goddammit, he died.
[352:03.01]That game put me over the edge.
[352:05.07]It did.
[352:05.33]I don't know why.
[352:06.31]It was a very interesting, fun experience until needing to sneak down the alleyway to find her.
[352:13.80]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[352:15.24]He says, what the fuck were you thinking?
[352:18.74]Yep.
[352:23.24]Thank you.
[352:26.43]Thank you, Captain Worgen, for the $1.10.
[352:28.82]They say that imitation is the ultimate form of flattery.
[352:32.06]So in my attempts to flatter you, I have removed my lower legs.
[352:35.76]So thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, for the $1.00.
[352:40.36]Garfield's back.
[352:42.48]Blippity Barf, knit that scarf.
[352:44.97]It's lots and lots of garfs.
[352:46.43]What's up there, Jerm the Flirm?
[352:49.82]Everyone wants to ban me after the Rick and Morty incident.
[352:53.34]How can I help that?
[352:54.58]Those hoodlums broke into my house.
[352:57.68]If a naked guy busts into Jerma's house, are you going to blame Jerma?
[353:01.21]Jerma, you've got to back me up on this one.
[353:02.89]The jury may side against me, but Judge Jerma won't drop the ban hammer on his good old pal Garfield.
[353:08.23]Also, Rick and the other guy stole my flat screen.
[353:18.52]Garfield...
[353:22.61]You know, we're not supposed to take sides here.
[353:27.77]But please welcome the new mod, GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[353:33.03]I'm just kidding.
[353:34.78]I'm just kidding.
[353:36.80]I'm just kidding.
[353:37.64]It's not going to happen.
[353:45.16]I can't do that.
[353:46.66]I've been reprimanded for doing that before.
[353:50.90]I've been like, I got like in trouble for doing that before.
[353:53.94]I'm not going to do that again.
[354:00.11]No, but see, I just modded you.
[354:03.17]I just modded Garfield in voice.
[354:06.41]So what happened was, it's like a pardon, right?
[354:08.97]So modded, demodded, right?
[354:10.69]But when you got modded, all your past crimes, everything is forgiven now.
[354:15.95]You got demodded, you just went back to a regular citizen.
[354:22.69]I just took away all the stuff.
[354:26.17]So there you go.
[354:26.95]Leave Garfield alone, guys.
[354:29.37]What did Garfield ever do to you?
[354:32.12]Besides continue to release the same boring comic book for like 45 years.
[354:39.82]And somebody still pays for it.
[354:43.36]They should have ended Garfield in like 2002.
[354:46.52]You know, on second thought, ban him.
[354:52.01]Ban Garfield.
[354:57.92]Yeah, on third thought, they've been in jail long enough.
[355:01.60]That was, did you count how many seconds that was?
[355:06.40]That was at least six or seven seconds.
[355:10.52]So that was almost, that was like 40 to 50 years in prison.
[355:14.81]I think they learned their lesson.
[355:17.51]Welcome back, Garfield.
[355:22.35]Thank you, Stormy Choo again for the $50.
[355:23.55]Stormy Choo, $50.
[355:27.56]We talked about it before, but thanks a lot, man.
[355:31.80]Much love to you.
[355:33.06]Have a comfy night for you as well.
[355:36.76]Divusp.
[355:38.02]Divusp.
[355:39.17]Thanks for the $1.
[355:40.15]Divusp.
[355:41.53]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your content for five years and it has helped me out with so much shit.
[355:46.91]From eye surgery to depression, oversleeping, post-grad, unemployment, and a bunch of other shit.
[355:51.75]Just want to say thank you for helping me and so many other people in the community with your hilarious and heartfelt content.
[355:56.66]Jeremy Hart.
[355:58.34]Also, I wanted to ask, since you've played a lot of FMV games, which ones are some of your favorite?
[356:03.48]Well, thank you, first of all, Div.
[356:10.99]Five years, it's been that long.
[356:12.87]Sometimes I fucking... I'm getting old, man.
[356:16.27]I was already getting old when I started.
[356:19.95]I was in my late 20s.
[356:20.67]I think I was 26, 25.
[356:25.63]into turning 27 when I was just barely starting on YouTube.
[356:30.54]Man, I'm turning 33 this year.
[356:32.54]It's been a long time.
[356:35.78]But, favorite FMV games.
[356:38.00]Wirehead is number one.
[356:42.02]The one where it was all the explosions, people flying out of windows and stuff.
[356:45.56]I don't even know what it was.
[356:47.04]I forget what it was called.
[356:51.48]It was too much.
[356:52.44]But Wirehead's definitely number one.
[356:55.29]Harvester is up there, too.
[356:59.87]It's probably third.
[357:01.77]Or, no, that's second.
[357:02.61]The stupid explosion, people flying out windows.
[357:05.28]It's probably third.
[357:09.04]And, no, actually, then you've got to get to all the western ones.
[357:11.62]There's a list too many.
[357:13.24]Mad Dog McCree.
[357:16.79]Oh, man.
[357:18.95]Doesn't it suck that we can't go back and experience those for the first time blind?
[357:24.34]You know how people say, man, I wish I could drink a potion and be able to go and play through Dark Souls again blind.
[357:31.18]Oh, so what a great experience.
[357:32.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[357:33.01]Give me the one where I could play through all the FMV games again and do it blind and not remember what happens.
[357:45.27]You wish you could watch a Zootopia blind again?
[357:51.02]Why?
[357:51.34]I mean, that movie's good, but is it drink the mind potion good?
[357:59.31]I don't think so.
[358:00.85]What does that movie have on Rotten Tomatoes?
[358:15.99]98% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[358:17.31]I disagree.
[358:19.38]I mean, come on, really 98%.
[358:20.89]I could see like that you're talking about your anything over 95 or 90.
[358:33.93]You're talking about like cinematic masterpieces.
[358:43.99]I'm not sure I would put Zootopia up there.
[358:47.73]with like the godfather maybe I could see this maybe at like like an 80 82 85 you've never seen the godfather
[359:19.90]I've never seen The Godfather.
[359:21.58]I don't know.
[359:22.30]I've never seen it.
[359:22.92]I've never watched it.
[359:24.29]He's right.
[359:27.97]I've never watched it.
[359:29.63]Okay?
[359:30.63]But I know, I'm certain, that it's better than Zootopia.
[359:39.41]And I like Zootopia.
[359:40.60]I thought it was a fun movie.
[359:44.02]But let's put it this way.
[359:44.90]I wouldn't write a book about it.
[359:47.21]They've written books about the Godfather.
[359:50.61]Are they going to in 10 years write a book about Zootopia?
[359:53.37]98%.
[359:54.21]They already did.
[360:08.20]No, fan fiction doesn't count.
[360:09.72]Don't even go down that road.
[360:17.46]Alright, what's the highest rated movie ever?
[360:23.03]Highest rated movie ever.
[360:27.13]Okay.
[360:27.33]Hey!
[360:28.49]Look who was right.
[360:30.87]The Shawshank Redemption.
[360:33.11]The Godfather.
[360:34.91]The Dark Knight.
[360:35.91]The Godfather Part 2.
[360:38.59]Pulp Fiction, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, Schindler's List, and The Lord of the Rings Return of the King are the top highest rated movies ever.
[360:48.94]So, I mean, come on.
[360:50.42]You got two Godfathers.
[360:51.84]You're going to put the Shawshank Redemption next to fucking Zootopia?
[360:59.12]And Zootopia.
[361:04.71]Yes.
[361:05.19]No, you're not.
[361:05.87]You're not going to do that.
[361:07.63]You're not going to put Zootopia next to the Shawshank Redemption and be like, yeah, these are the same.
[361:17.68]And you know what's not fair?
[361:19.18]Here's another thing that's not fair about movies.
[361:22.20]So comedy movies, if you label your movie a comedy, and it's a comedy, you are guaranteed to have less than 60% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[361:33.86]You make that comedy an animated comedy, it's guaranteed to be over 85.
[361:43.97]What's up with that?
[361:48.83]That doesn't seem very fair.
[361:59.84]Rotten Tomatoes isn't very credible.
[362:01.26]It shouldn't be that popular.
[362:04.27]Sausage party?
[362:09.61]But sausage party is, that's like one outlier.
[362:20.94]Sausage party is, there's like one.
[362:23.28]Is there any others?
[362:24.90]And why is there a sausage party too?
[362:28.02]Is that a thing?
[362:29.92]No, it is real.
[362:31.18]Why would you make two of these?
[362:40.01]I don't know why you'd make two of those.
[362:47.20]Yeah, this sausage party too.
[362:54.66]98% liked it.
[363:01.45]It doesn't matter.
[363:02.47]All I'm saying is Zootopia is a great movie.
[363:04.91]I don't know if it's...
[363:08.32]Like, that's like Ocarina of Time in the video game world.
[363:13.68]I wouldn't put Zootopia next to Ocarina of Time.
[363:18.48]Equivalent, you know, that's what I'm saying.
[363:23.22]Anyways, thank you to...
[363:28.07]Bro luck for the $1.
[363:29.05]The angles filmed by the three cameras in your garden do not cover the whole surface.
[363:33.06]It would thus be possible for someone to slip in unaware by the servant's entrance through the blind spots.
[363:38.24]Consider why you did, why did you write this?
[363:41.73]Thank you, Antoxin, for the $1.
[363:42.79]Hey, Jerma, I gave you some bits about a week ago about my surgery.
[363:47.25]The time has come, and by morning time, I'll be under anesthesia.
[363:52.35]I'm keeping your upstairs mentality in mind.
[363:54.75]And hopefully you'll supply me some interesting streams while I'm in the hospital.
[363:59.31]Love you lots and see you soon.
[364:02.13]And Doxan, I'll wish you the best of luck.
[364:06.99]And like I said, your body is going to heal.
[364:12.03]Your body will come back.
[364:14.87]But your brain, your mind, is what you have to keep healthy during the whole process.
[364:24.52]You cannot speed up physical recovery, but you can mentally prepare for it.
[364:31.16]So take great care of yourself.
[364:35.30]Hope the surgery goes stunningly well.
[364:39.17]Thank you so much, Indoxen.
[364:40.25]Good luck.

[369:08.77]You bang these out in less than an hour or two, don't you?
[369:13.79]This is awesome.
[369:18.07]This one took... This one I took some time with.
[369:21.51]It definitely shows.
[369:26.65]This probably took a long time, man.
[369:27.85]Thank you.
[369:28.13]It's awesome.
[369:34.64]You should be... I'm not going to read that, but that was... No.
[369:39.14]Thank you, It's Time for Slime.
[369:40.98]Another great animation.

[370:18.91]phantasmagoria 2 sucked though all these things about you now let's go dancing at a club it was really confusing and we didn't wait hold on oh yeah that was outrageous which is the one that sucked we no we beat phantasmagoria 2. we
[370:46.70]The first one is the one that just didn't make any sense.
[370:49.13]We beat Phantasmagoria 2.
[370:51.93]The office where everyone's dying in the office.
[370:56.37]No, that was... We looked up the... Yeah, but the game was so bad.
[371:00.93]Wasn't that the one where you just literally walk around the office and find out computer codes?
[371:11.93]I lied.
[371:12.53]Liar.
[371:14.63]I'm thinking of Harvester then.
[371:19.60]It was Phantasmagoria 2 was the one where you were at the office.
[371:25.82]But whatever.
[371:27.76]Might have to check those out again someday.
[371:29.44]Maybe for Halloween.
[371:31.96]Thank you, Frexter.
[371:32.54]Thank you, Raincoat, for the $5.
[371:34.06]Hey, Billy Beehive, what does a pirate say when he turns 80?
[371:37.05]Aye, matey.
[371:41.09]Are you more into dark humor?
[371:42.65]Dark humor is like food, but not everybody... What are you talking about?
[371:47.51]Am I into dark humor?
[371:58.42]Thanks.
[371:59.56]And go fuck yourself.
[372:01.68]What?
[372:04.09]Oh no, go heart yourself.
[372:06.55]I'm 80.
[372:07.81]Why is that dark humor?
[372:08.99]Not everybody gets it.
[372:18.76]I think dark humor has a place.
[372:20.98]I do.
[372:22.16]Just depends on what it is.
[372:27.53]I think a lot of people use dark humor in place of actually coming up with an interesting scenario.
[372:36.16]I think it does have a purpose.
[372:37.54]I think it's funny.
[372:40.78]Some of it is.
[372:42.64]But it depends on how it's used.
[372:43.88]Because dark humor can really just be overdone to a point where it's just trying to shock people for no reason.
[372:59.27]I like dark humor as long as it's an actual joke and not just face-level shock.
[373:03.54]Yeah, there you go.
[373:04.82]That's perfect.
[373:12.30]It's a joke.
[373:13.02]Read it.
[373:13.28]What do you mean it's a joke?
[373:17.94]Are you more into dark humor?
[373:19.02]Dark humor is like food.
[373:20.44]Not everybody gets it.
[373:21.60]Not everybody gets the joke.
[373:25.27]What do you mean?
[373:26.29]Gets the joke?
[373:30.19]Oh.
[373:31.07]Oh.
[373:32.27]Oh, okay.
[373:33.33]Oh.
[373:34.21]Oh, boy.
[373:36.31]Oh.
[373:38.57]Oh.
[373:41.11]Oh.
[373:45.32]Oh.
[373:48.88]Okay.
[373:49.50]I get it.
[373:57.44]Sad Jerma.
[374:01.79]But yes, I do get it.
[374:06.08]But like I said... If it's a clever, thought-out, actually interesting thing... Yes, but if it's just simply... Let me see how many people I can shock!
[374:18.89]Yeah!
[374:20.35]Like, I don't know.
[374:22.01]Some people think that shit's funny, and... I'm glad you do.
[374:29.09]He did the voice.
[374:33.39]I'm not going to say, how dare you think dark humor in that regard is not funny.
[374:41.03]I hate you!
[374:42.74]No, I just don't think, whatever.
[374:44.78]If you think it's funny, I'm glad you do.
[374:45.88]I hope you get some enjoyment out of any kind of humor that you think is funny.
[374:48.94]There you go.
[374:49.68]He did the voice.
[374:50.20]That wasn't shocking or that funny.
[374:54.74]Yeah, I know what I'm just saying.
[374:56.31]Family Guy is not dark humor.
[374:59.61]When did I say Family Guy?
[375:07.47]Family Guy from family guys not humor period but okay hold on a second until Family Guy became a meme and started making a parody on itself
[375:32.67]The first three or four seasons of Family Guy, they're funny, they're not bad.
[375:44.64]After season four of Family Guy, the whole show sucked.
[375:51.31]Season six on is where that show was just like, alright, this show's stupid.
[375:59.68]Family Guy gets way more shit than it deserves.
[376:01.42]No, I agree.
[376:02.50]I do.
[376:03.22]I think that the last like six plus seven years of Family Guy deserves all the hate that it gets.
[376:18.53]But I think there is a honeymoon phase with Family Guy where three, four, maybe five of those first five seasons where there was some pretty funny episodes.
[376:29.62]And then everybody lumps that in with the terrible piece of shit part of Family Guy that is the last five to ten years.
[376:37.19]The new Simpsons episodes aren't even good, right?
[376:39.35]Yeah, so that's the thing.
[376:41.29]Don't ever have a TV show that's more than like fucking five to ten years worth of seasons.
[376:46.42]How can people not figure this out?
[376:51.78]Once you go past...
[376:54.06]the six, seven, eight, nine year run of a comedy show, it starts to become a parody on itself.
[377:00.94]It happens to every single one.
[377:03.36]All of them.
[377:10.90]It's odd that you bring it up South Park because South Park is the one outlier here, I think.
[377:18.90]South Park has been consistently good.
[377:22.48]Forever.
[377:28.37]I don't think South Park has ran into that problem.
[377:35.96]To be honest, I never liked South Park.
[377:44.64]Always Sunny is, yeah, Always Sunny is still funny.
[377:47.54]But Always Sunny is getting to that point where I can feel it starting to get to that kind of stretched out place.
[377:57.33]South Park sucks?
[377:58.81]Really?
[378:02.00]I was under the impression that South Park was... The sentiment around South Park was it's still really good.
[378:14.89]South Park is like a 6 out of 10.
[378:18.27]Yeah, but remember... Okay, let's say that South Park is like a 6 or a 7 out of 10 right now.
[378:25.70]In your opinion.
[378:28.00]Think of all these other comedy shows that have been on the air for more than... Especially animated comedies.
[378:36.43]That have been on the air for 10 plus, 15 plus years.
[378:41.19]And you're like, holy shit, that show's a two.
[378:47.50]Now, shows can have bad episodes still.
[378:51.12]There are plenty of South Park episodes that I think are bad episodes that weren't funny.
[378:54.62]That just kind of fell flat.
[378:56.59]But as a whole, I think the show is still interesting.
[378:59.93]Oh, by the way, really important.
[379:01.63]I haven't seen the last two full seasons of this show.
[379:05.07]So, okay.
[379:05.89]Speaking from total ignorance again, just want to make sure we're clear about that.
[379:14.39]But, you know, like I remember like a couple of years ago, still watching South Park and going like, oh, that was actually a pretty interesting episode.
[379:27.89]This is not as good as the Godfather.
[379:33.03]But yeah.
[379:35.18]We talked about Rick and Morty too.
[379:36.62]Rick and Morty's only been on the air for like three years and it already like is disintegrating.
[379:42.64]But I... Okay, be honest with me.
[379:45.14]I want you to be honest in this chat with yourself before... Wait, don't... Nobody... Hold on.
[379:52.00]Wait.
[379:52.68]Wait.
[379:54.85]Before season three and before the Reddit meme, did you like Rick and Morty?
[380:03.04]Say it, be realistic with me.
[380:04.40]I'm seeing a whole lot of yeses here.
[380:12.10]You loved season one, didn't you?
[380:17.35]Before the McDonald's sauce joke and the Reddit meme and season three.
[380:23.66]Didn't... Wasn't season one and two real fucking good?
[380:31.84]It's interesting how that can happen.
[380:43.37]One of the episodes... A Rick and Morty episode in season two.
[380:47.80]If you take away all, like, the...
[380:50.25]You know, like the shmoggle bloggle bloggers blogs.
[380:53.61]Like all the Justin Roiland stuff that he does sometimes.
[380:57.31]The part where they're the Mr. Poopy Butthole.
[381:00.61]They're like infiltrating everybody's brains and the parasites.
[381:02.81]I loved that episode.
[381:12.23]That episode was fucking hysterical.
[381:15.21]And it deserves credit for being interesting and funny.
[381:24.87]You didn't like that episode.
[381:25.93]I loved that episode.
[381:29.57]For a couple of different reasons.
[381:35.94]But yes, Rick and Morty did kind of turn in... It turned in on itself.
[381:41.90]And then... It just kind of got taken over by this crazy audience that now everybody...
[381:50.14]is like a shame to admit that they liked to that that show was a couple I liked a few episodes of that show you like can't say they're not allowed to say that now hey it's getting you know it's getting the Undertale treatment it is it is getting the Undertale treatment that's real life
[382:21.18]You can't say that because your IQ is too low.
[382:29.30]This guy liked Rick and Morty on stream.
[382:36.31]Yeah, like the first season, a handful of episodes from the second season, and then season three became like a joke parody on itself, and they started trying way too hard.
[382:48.53]But there's no Pickle Rick in Undertale.
[382:52.91]Exactly He admits it He said the funny thing guys he heard it How is that comedy
[383:20.34]It's not.
[383:21.62]It's just a guy screaming words.
[383:28.02]But it could be funny, I guess.
[383:34.32]If you thought it was funny.
[383:35.40]It's situational.
[383:40.25]I mean, but here's the thing.
[383:41.87]Everybody starts... We're so like... Here's the problem with today's world.
[383:45.61]Do you want to know the problem with today's world?
[383:48.47]I'm going to tell you.
[383:51.49]Everybody treats everything that they like as if it's their personal religion.
[383:58.81]You ever notice that?
[384:01.03]And if like you say that Rick and Morty sucks, you are talking about somebody's religion.
[384:06.51]And what the fuck did you say?
[384:08.87]I've dedicated my entire life to this.
[384:15.54]Everybody's so just so mad and so mean about everything.
[384:22.26]Well, I've just got to take a step back and really just stop the hate, you know what I mean?
[384:30.89]And do not ever, under any circumstance, buy any of those terrible fucking Family Guy DVDs.
[384:42.10]They're terrible.
[384:44.14]You pay for six episodes a disk.
[384:48.17]Un-fucking-believable.
[384:51.21]Remember that shit?
[384:51.93]Remember buying DVDs and there were four episodes on a DVD and they were 12 bucks?
[384:58.19]Un-fucking-believable.
[385:11.41]No, I kid, I kid.
[385:15.01]But people get really upset nowadays.
[385:18.21]Somebody used to say something to you online
[385:20.22]About like a thing you liked or a thing that you didn't like.
[385:23.68]And you'd be like, oh, that guy's a fucking dumbass.
[385:26.48]That guy sucks, whatever.
[385:29.02]People like actively like, let me find, let me get like a group and fucking come get you.
[385:34.82]Everyone gets so mad now.
[385:38.41]He used to just like kind of write somebody off as like a dumbass.
[385:46.03]This is where he makes his enemies.
[385:49.92]I think like Twitter happened, right?
[385:52.28]Twitter came out, and it just turned on like the anger switch.
[386:04.59]You know, I think Twitter was created by Satan.
[386:08.20]Everyone wants to find, I gotta find out where, oh, where, who, who's the Antichrist?
[386:13.02]It's Twitter.com.
[386:17.16]It was made, it had to have been, and it's like, that's like Satan's plan.
[386:28.98]It's like, I have an idea.
[386:30.56]I will devise a plan to make it so you have to say your whole thought in 140 characters.
[386:39.05]And I'll make a bunch of famous people go on there and get a little blue checkmark so you know you're talking shit to the right person.
[386:46.23]And I'll also... Oh, a spider.
[386:53.39]See, start talking shit about Twitter, all of a sudden a spider shows up.
[386:56.15]Satan.
[387:04.03]He's coming for me.
[387:13.00]I don't like participate.
[387:14.90]Everyone's like, why haven't you posted on Facebook in three years?
[387:19.36]I don't care.
[387:20.94]Oh, social media.
[387:29.15]I'm telling you, it's the social media.
[387:35.34]Wait, people still use Facebook?
[387:41.99]I think they do.
[387:47.97]But, regardless of this nonsensical conversation we've been having, social media is too toxic.
[388:04.67]I think people use it for good purposes.
[388:08.11]I think social media has a lot of great strides.
[388:11.25]But you're watching this stream because of social media.
[388:14.65]Like, right?
[388:16.45]This is social media.
[388:17.63]That's what we're doing right now.
[388:27.16]Reddit is social media.
[388:31.28]No, I'm watching it on a rock.
[388:34.19]Reddit's not social media?
[388:35.35]Yes, it is.
[388:42.97]What's worse, fried mustard or boiled mayonnaise?
[388:46.53]Mix them up.
[388:48.25]And cover your eyes and then grab into one of the jars.
[388:55.46]Oh my god, I never knew.
[388:57.12]We're the toxic ones.
[388:59.58]Wait a minute, hold on.
[389:00.26]Are we the bad guys?
[389:02.00]Oh no.
[389:03.49]It's been us the whole time.
[389:09.09]Social media is ruining the world.
[389:11.14]Re.
[389:17.56]That's not what I'm saying, by the way.
[389:20.72]I love social media.
[389:30.67]Don't say re.
[389:32.09]I didn't...
[389:37.23]Don't re right now.
[389:38.61]Come on.
[389:43.25]Then post on it.
[389:44.97]I do.
[389:45.46]I posted about this stream.
[389:47.90]I said, hey, I'm streaming guys.
[389:49.24]We're playing this game.
[389:50.08]Social media.
[389:51.06]Re.
[389:51.58]That's what I said.
[390:00.53]My next stream announcement, I should just write re and then put the Twitter, the Twitch link.
[390:10.64]No, I can't do that.
[390:11.60]That's too... I don't want to do that.
[390:15.64]Guys, please don't say re.
[390:17.08]My mom checks my computer.
[390:22.53]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[390:30.65]Isn't that interesting?
[390:35.44]We reserve this end of the stream here to talk about anything.
[390:40.93]This is not the real stream.
[390:44.59]We're going to talk about social media.
[390:46.81]We're going to talk about moving.
[390:47.95]We're going to talk about re.
[390:53.93]Guys, stop spamming.
[390:55.05]It hates my laptop and burns my legs.
[390:59.27]That's an old one.
[391:01.05]I love that one.
[391:06.01]That is the best one.
[391:07.65]It really is.
[391:17.28]Watching Crips stream.
[391:19.38]Criparian, if you guys know the guy that, you know, Hearthstone, Diablo.
[391:24.44]I remember back when that got traction for the first time.
[391:30.01]There was so many people posting that.
[391:32.47]So, so many people were posting, spamming the please don't spam, it burns my legs.
[391:39.45]It was the whole stream.
[391:40.61]It was the whole chat for like at least 20 to 30 seconds or something.
[391:46.36]And it's just like, you're spamming because you're telling everybody not to and you're all getting your legs burned.
[391:59.18]The old coffee pasta game was on point a few years ago.
[392:11.39]That's the joke, Dad?
[392:12.73]I know, and I'm giving... I'm commending...
[392:16.87]That joke.
[392:34.64]It's just too late.
[392:35.62]I'm laughing at stuff that I shouldn't be.
[392:52.97]Ugh.
[392:53.51]I can't even.
[392:58.69]Fuck.
[392:59.23]Okay.
[392:59.67]We're almost done with the bits.
[393:10.35]It's just so absurd.
[393:11.65]It didn't even... It's not even real.
[393:18.19]Alright.
[393:18.67]Okay.
[393:19.21]Alright.
[393:21.33]What the fuck?
[393:23.23]Oh, get over it.
[393:24.15]I gotta get myself together here.
[393:39.20]Whenever you idiots pause you, I'm reading the works of Plato, etc.
[393:43.50]Guess it'll get a better job.
[393:52.19]I think that shit's really funny.
[393:54.45]I'm sorry.
[393:54.95]People might think I'm an idiot, but like seeing that shit put in somebody's chat with like 30,000 concurrent viewers, it's fucking hilarious.
[394:04.62]It's absolutely hysterical.
[394:06.54]I think it's funny.
[394:14.35]Because he's not even going to see it.
[394:16.65]If you have like a 20, 30, 40,000 concurrent stream, you're not going to see that guy.
[394:23.15]The guy that writes like the crazy shit or the guy that writes the thing that's just blatantly untrue, you're never going to see it.
[394:29.75]It's not going to happen.
[394:35.89]What's the point of chats with streams that big?
[394:38.75]At some point, it just turns into fucking people screaming at each other.
[394:43.85]Oh.
[394:45.63]Jerma won't see this.
[394:46.51]See, my chat's slow enough where I can see it.
[394:48.19]Three.
[394:58.25]Oh.
[394:59.55]I love this place.
[395:09.30]Shit is so funny.
[395:10.32]I love funny shit like that.
[395:12.62]I love this space.
[395:13.88]This space is amazing.
[395:23.98]Everybody's like such a joker here.
[395:25.93]It's like, oh, so fucking funny.
[395:34.42]But anyways, let's finish up these bits.
[395:36.36]Let's get away from the tired, like, nonsense.
[395:39.80]We started with, like, talking about how Family Guy was funny for, like, three seasons.
[395:43.80]And it spiraled into, like, religion.
[395:45.24]And then it spiraled into, like, Twitter is the antichrist.
[395:48.28]I don't know how the fuck we got there.
[395:50.38]And none of it... Don't listen to any of that shit.
[395:53.78]I'm overtired and malnourished right now.
[395:59.59]That's just the... After the stream, hangout, malnourished.
[396:04.82]backtracking part of the stream we're doing now.
[396:06.60]You understand?
[396:10.98]Anyways, Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[396:13.78]What are some games you really want to play on stream?
[396:15.62]By the way, I'm going to miss you while you're gone.
[396:17.04]Some games I really want to play on stream.
[396:25.97]I think I've done a lot of them.
[396:31.59]I can't think of anything that I really want to stream that I haven't
[396:39.16]Wait, I missed the Zootopia part.
[396:40.42]What was my opinion?
[396:41.86]I said it was a good movie, but I didn't think it should deserve the rating next to The Godfather.
[396:48.81]No, we're not going back.
[396:49.45]That's how it started.
[396:50.13]We're not going to open the can of worms again.
[396:59.72]Mods, please put the chat in emote-only mode.
[397:01.82]I don't know how to read, and images are easier to make sense of.
[397:11.59]How would you be able to type?
[397:14.51]Oh my god.
[397:15.76]Is there a list of every stupid copy pasta that's ever existed on Twitch?
[397:21.74]Can somebody link it to me?
[397:27.18]Because I need to.
[397:28.14]I will sit there tonight and read them all.
[397:39.07]They have a Reddit for that.
[397:40.61]Of course they do.
[397:45.81]But we're almost done with the bits.
[397:48.39]Let's get to it, huh?
[397:53.79]Let's see here.
[397:55.03]Right here.
[397:59.60]How did we get... No, it started with the dark humor thing.
[398:06.34]Right.
[398:06.64]That was like an hour ago.
[398:08.60]Holy shit.
[398:09.30]Thank you, Raincoat, for the $5.
[398:10.36]E-Dragon, thank you for the $15, E-Dragon.
[398:17.78]This was such a stressful and annoying game, but you managed to make it hilarious at the same time.
[398:22.37]Thanks for the years of quality entertainment.
[398:23.93]Hi.
[398:25.39]Hi, E-Dragon.

[398:29.89]Appreciate it.
[398:34.72]Thank you.
[398:35.14]There were some annoying parts in this game, but as a whole, I thought it was funny and interesting.
[398:40.72]Thank you, Scripps3, for the $1.
[398:42.18]So now that the game is done, can you please describe what was up with the story or what happened?
[398:45.53]I don't know.
[398:49.13]If you sat me down in the room and paid me $5,000 to tell you the story of that game, I would not be able to do it.
[398:56.80]You would keep your money.
[398:57.50]I have no idea what happened.
[399:03.46]Thank you, FH Gregory, for the $1.
[399:05.36]Hey there, Boston boy.

[401:15.97]Shoot it!
[401:16.41]No!
[401:17.29]Oh my god!
[401:19.49]He's done it!
[401:23.69]What the fuck was that?
[401:27.47]Oh, that game gave me so much anxiety.
[401:31.59]Thank you, bro.
[401:32.19]Luck for the $1.
[401:32.67]Dude, I was crying yesterday during this.
[401:35.07]Don't go in the top row!
[401:36.32]Don't go in the top row!
[401:37.64]No, I can't take it!
[401:39.52]I can't do it!
[401:44.30]Top rope, man.
[401:45.10]Don't go on it.
[401:48.24]They asked each other nicely.
[401:49.42]I don't know why they didn't listen to each other.
[401:57.49]I wanted to do more dumb shit.
[401:59.19]I'm going to have to go back to that.
[402:00.95]I was going to come down after getting water and do way more fucked up shit.
[402:06.10]Way worse than that.
[402:14.66]I was gonna try to drink the water on the other camera.
[402:18.32]I was gonna try to pour the water into the other person's mouth.
[402:25.39]I was gonna try.
[402:27.51]That would put water on the floor.
[402:37.22]No, it wouldn't.
[402:38.86]It would go into the other person's mouth.
[402:48.73]But anyways, thank you, Coconut, for the $1.
[402:52.60]Thanks for playing the game I recommended.
[402:54.10]This stream made me really happy.
[402:56.40]I'll try to recommend less frustrating games in the future.
[402:58.62]No, this game was perfect.
[403:01.42]Look, there was like one or two frustrating puzzles in five hours.
[403:04.84]That's not a big deal.
[403:05.58]That's perfectly fine, dude.
[403:07.38]Thank you for the recommendation.
[403:08.66]It was great.
[403:11.60]Thank you, Abortion Shark, for the $1.32.
[403:16.65]I moved from New Jersey to near Vegas about two years ago with another person on a road trip.
[403:22.29]It can be done in about a week, but it's rough.
[403:26.09]That's pretty much the same distance I'd be going.
[403:30.62]You went, no, it's about the same, I think it's the same distance.
[403:36.12]You take the same roads, so.
[403:38.36]But yeah, not sure I'm looking forward to that.
[403:42.58]Who am I thanking?
[403:50.26]Wait, what?
[403:50.64]Because... What is his name?
[403:56.00]Oh, his name?
[403:57.86]Mr. Shark?
[403:58.68]Should I start calling him Mr. Shark?
[404:00.65]No, that's too close to Mr. Sark.
[404:05.13]Oh, Mr. Shark!
[404:14.59]He's a great guy, by the way, if you didn't know.
[404:17.36]But thank you do thank you snooze for the one dollar speaking of the switch Are you planning on playing Breath of the Wild or Mario Odyssey on stream?
[404:25.93]Both are definitely worth playing not on stream.
[404:28.45]I feel like I missed the boat to play those games on stream I'm not I don't think I'm too keen on playing games like that and I'll tell you a couple of reasons why Those games are very long
[404:52.14]Breath of the Wild is, isn't it like hundreds of hours long?
[404:59.42]Odyssey is short if you don't 100% it.
[405:00.71]It's like 100 hours.
[405:04.47]Yeah, I don't know if we do 100 hour games on this stream.
[405:09.27]It's hard for us to get through like a 20 hour game on this stream.
[405:13.46]I don't know if I'd be able to do 100 hours.
[405:21.26]Play Smash Ultimate on stream?
[405:22.72]Yes.
[405:24.19]That is something that me and Etalyx will be able to do.
[405:26.51]Because we both have a Switch.
[405:29.77]I will 1v1 Etalyx with Pac-Man.
[405:37.58]You spent 7 hours on a stream on House Flipper.
[405:39.66]Way more than that.
[405:41.00]That game was streamed for like 20 something hours, wasn't it?
[405:44.78]Over the course of 3 or 4 streams.
[405:49.85]Your Pac-Man sucks though.
[405:53.79]I'm not I'm not competing in like a top 10 tournament here sitting down with my buddy eating pringles we're gonna be able to do it on the couch sour cream and onion pringles cheddar pringles once you pop fun don't stop pizza pringles
[406:23.48]Pizza Pringles smell weird.
[406:24.62]I can't eat them.
[406:29.32]Open up a fresh Pizza Pringles and just sniff inside that container.
[406:33.22]You won't want to eat them.
[406:34.34]I guarantee it.
[406:36.40]They taste fine.
[406:37.56]They just stink.
[406:45.02]But anyways, moving on.
[406:48.81]I still have to get Breath of the Wild on the Switch and just play it.

[410:19.69]That was Concerto.
[410:20.29]Thank you, Concerto.
[410:20.97]Thank you, Zefendu, for the $1.
[410:22.91]Some people can't afford $1.
[410:24.41]I know.
[410:26.63]And I'm sorry that we had to put this in place.
[410:30.27]Blame Garfield.
[410:31.49]Thank you, Ermine, for the $5, Ermine.

[411:01.12]Okay, here we go.
[411:10.01]Get on there.
[411:15.27]Always upvote B video.
[411:20.67]I think going on a diet is not a bad idea.
[411:30.69]Your time has come to die vile beasts Here it is Here is where I die My only regret is not being able to slay the giant That I wasn't able to protect my wife and children from the beast
[411:52.38]After it infested our home with the smoke I knew there was only one option for me.
[411:57.24]And that was to slay the beast.
[411:59.61]Or die trying.
[412:01.17]And thus is the story of life.
[412:03.67]Good doesn't always win.
[412:05.55]Because in the end.
[412:07.33]My friends.
[412:08.79]My wife.
[412:10.20]My children.
[412:11.58]They all will perish at the hand of the giant beast.
[412:36.43]You have to put that explosion.
[412:43.15]That was good, though.
[412:48.50]That makes me seem really, really evil and terrible.
[412:56.88]That was sad.
[412:58.00]That was very sad.
[413:01.88]Thank you, Irvine.
[413:04.96]for your incredible bee story.
[413:11.32]Up in smoke.
[413:12.46]Hey, Jake Games, thanks for the $1.
[413:14.41]It took me approximately three months to farm these bits.
[413:16.61]Now please, Jeremy, please let me purchase a shirt from you.
[413:19.63]Nearly two years ago, I asked when you would be releasing a shirt, and do you know what you said?
[413:23.61]You said it would be a few months.
[413:28.14]It has been two years, Jeremy.
[413:31.54]Two years.
[413:34.37]You know what they say, though.
[413:35.63]You can't rush perfection.
[413:44.45]Well, hey, JakeGames, I got news for you.
[413:47.81]I'm going to tell you what the t-shirt is.
[413:51.94]You understand?
[413:53.38]Not only am I going to confirm that a t-shirt is currently almost done, but I'm going to tell you what it is.
[414:04.00]it is a t-shirt of the Jerma solar system in the sky beautiful night sky and a father and son looking through a telescope on a hill pointing up at the night sky and it's currently being made by Ashley
[414:31.88]She did the last shirt and it was amazing.
[414:34.12]So we've been talking about doing it.
[414:37.74]It's actually funny because like a year ago, she started making it.
[414:44.64]And then like, I got, we kind of just, everybody fell, went the other directions, right?
[414:51.72]Me and Star stopped like talking for a little while.
[414:55.37]And now we're finishing it.
[414:57.23]So.
[415:04.06]It looks awesome.
[415:06.02]Let's just say that.
[415:10.38]You'll see that pretty soon.
[415:12.68]It is a great t-shirt.
[415:16.45]Is the child on the shirt you?
[415:18.91]No.
[415:21.45]It is a silhouette, like I said, of a father and son on a hill.
[415:26.52]pointing up at the sky and it's like essentially the father's holding the son's hand and it's a very touching moment with a pointing up silhouette.
[415:39.52]It's beautiful.
[415:48.91]It will be available for a long time.
[415:52.57]So here's what's going to happen.
[415:55.64]So what's going to happen is it's going to be on Teespring again for three weeks.
[416:01.29]The Glue Man shirt is also going back on sale at the same time for three weeks.
[416:07.19]And then after that,
[416:14.08]I will gauge to see if enough people, you know, how many people bought it?
[416:18.54]How many people still want one?
[416:19.90]Is it worth putting it up again?
[416:21.84]And then maybe like a few months later, I'll just put it up again for a three week, like a two or three week period.
[416:31.55]Time to wait two years.
[416:40.57]Will the shirt be up to date with all the current planet emotes?
[416:43.88]Yes.
[416:45.32]Yes, it will.
[416:47.66]At least the ones that I think deserve to be on a shirt.
[416:50.12]Let's put it that way.
[416:56.20]The ones that should be on a t-shirt.
[417:04.58]Which ones will be left out, I'm sure you'll see.
[417:13.25]But anyways, coldest fridge.
[417:15.46]Thanks for the $1.
[417:16.32]Okay, Jeremy, here's your doll.
[417:17.34]I just wanted to show you this rad song I found.
[417:20.44]Found a rad song.
[417:29.05]Rad song.
[417:55.25]version of that song from 30 million.
[418:25.29]I feel like I have to sing lyrics to this song.
[418:28.35]Do it, please.
[418:29.89]That was awesome.
[418:31.01]Coldest Ridge.
[418:53.52]Thank you for showing that to me.
[418:54.41]I'm not sure if you made that or not, but it's cool nonetheless.
[419:00.63]And thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[419:03.53]I made another Wasp video, but it's from a different part of the stream.
[419:06.45]I made a different part of the stream.
[419:14.40]This is from a different part of the stream.
[419:19.60]Let's find out.
[419:23.61]What is this gonna do?
[419:25.41]What if I catch him and he's... What is he doing?
[419:27.95]What is he doing?
[419:29.04]He's doing like a yoga move.
[419:29.92]Oh my fucking god, fine, ready?
[419:55.85]What am I holding?
[420:08.81]I have a brick in my hand?
[420:10.71]What am I holding?
[420:12.08]Oh, it's a Labo.
[420:13.00]It's the Labo motorcycle bottom.
[420:19.00]Thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[420:21.12]Here's the link to that one.
[420:31.59]Brick would have been better.
[420:34.51]Thank you to VATS for the $1.25.
[420:35.99]Hey, Jerma, if you could direct a multi-million dollar movie and you had full creative control, what would I make?
[420:41.23]You're going to have to give me a few hours because I got all day to tell you about that.
[420:54.87]You know what?
[420:55.25]It's guaranteed to get a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes, though, because it would be a comedy.
[420:59.49]So, sorry.
[421:00.97]It wouldn't be highly rated.
[421:06.13]But thank you.
[421:07.21]Thank you, Thevious, for the $1.
[421:08.55]I didn't know we were bringing back the bee joke, so here's a joke that finished uploading the moment your room got filled with hornets.
[421:15.34]Okay.
[421:18.64]I think the thing about...
[421:24.27]Here you go.
[421:25.63]Let's put it on there.
[421:32.50]OBSproject.com.
[421:36.32]So I think the thing about going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[421:41.92]Oh, shit.
[421:42.24]Hold on.
[421:42.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[421:43.06]Hold on.
[421:43.34]Wait till he lands.
[421:43.90]Wait till he lands.
[421:44.96]OK, he landed.
[421:54.68]Ooh, up in smoke.
[422:00.73]Why am I the Hornet?
[422:03.61]Why am I the Hornet?
[422:06.55]Dot Lilina, thanks for the $1.
[422:08.77]Will you ever make your own FMV game?
[422:10.34]It was actually something I wanted to do.
[422:12.40]I wanted to do that like a year ago.
[422:14.24]It's just too much money.
[422:15.52]And it's such a huge project.
[422:17.64]I wanted to, though.
[422:21.06]I would love nothing more than to do that.
[422:25.17]To make a video game, though, and especially one that requires a bunch of film crews and actors and programmers, it's tens of thousands of dollars that I do not have.
[422:33.50]And it might even be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[422:35.42]So... You know... That's what you gotta say to that.
[422:46.79]We could act in it for free!
[422:53.40]Thank you, though.
[422:54.78]Novi.
[422:55.20]Thanks, Novi, for the $1.33.
[422:56.06]Here's a beat editor I don't think you've seen yet.
[423:03.94]I don't think I've seen this yet.
[423:06.90]Why don't we check it out?
[423:09.12]This one's called Full Metal Jerma. ...
[423:28.71]Oh, shit.
[423:29.01]Hold on.
[423:29.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[423:29.59]Hold on.
[423:39.51]By the way, just in case anybody is curious, this is spoilers.
[423:45.51]There's spoilers in this video.
[423:46.51]If you don't want to see, like, spoiler stuff of Full Metal Alchemist, you don't.
[423:53.06]I would be careful about watching the rest of this.
[423:56.40]Spoilers at

[425:01.83]Reaper!
[425:02.97]Hey, Reaper500, thanks for the one dollar.
[425:04.96]Hey, Jerma, I need you to do the Jerma nose wipe pose to prove my friend that it's not a dab.
[425:09.32]It needs to be on the camera for it to count.
[425:10.86]We need to see it.
[425:12.86]There was already an image captured of it.
[425:16.04]It is right here.
[425:21.77]See, when you're really tired, here's the problem.
[425:24.53]When you're really tired, that's the actual name of that image file.
[425:30.14]The actual image name is germadab.
[425:32.88]It's the image file.
[425:33.86]I'll prove it to you right now if I have to.
[425:35.00]Oh, what is he going to make?
[425:35.92]He's going to rename it.
[425:36.92]No, it's right here.
[425:43.54]Germadab 28.
[425:44.03]There it is.
[425:50.20]I didn't do it.
[425:52.78]Here it is.
[425:53.24]Check it out.
[425:54.12]Window capture.
[425:54.64]I want to make sure you understand that I'm not making this up.
[426:06.61]Why can I not cap it?
[426:12.29]I'll do a screen grab.
[426:19.88]There.
[426:20.04]I haven't touched anything.
[426:32.65]There you go.
[426:37.00]Yeah, I fucked up.
[426:37.92]Sorry.
[426:41.92]Sometimes.
[426:45.48]I'm so tired right now.
[426:50.52]Take a look at the top.
[426:56.18]Dermadeb, 28.
[426:56.80]Oh, well.
[427:11.87]Oh, you want me to?
[427:12.83]You know what?
[427:13.97]I'll prove it to you.
[427:14.71]I'll go a step further.
[427:16.45]It's time to go a step further.
[427:18.59]Let's go to my Twitch dashboard.
[427:21.25]I'll prove it even further.
[427:31.44]He's a liar.
[427:32.32]He's a liar.
[427:33.02]Let's see.
[427:34.10]Let's go to my actual channel affiliate partner settings and go see what that image is called.
[427:44.39]Hold on.
[427:46.89]Here it is.
[427:47.57]Emotes.
[427:54.05]And where is it?
[427:54.89]There it is.
[428:01.98]Can I actually wait?
[428:03.48]Maybe not.
[428:05.66]Maybe I can't prove this.
[428:09.05]No, I can't.
[428:10.79]Oh, well.
[428:13.39]Why is it 28?
[428:13.81]Because it's the 28 by 28 pixels.
[428:15.31]28 by 28 pixels.
[428:27.96]Why do I need to prove this?
[428:29.24]I don't even need to prove this.
[428:32.30]It's time for bed.
[428:33.84]Alright, we're at the end.
[428:43.46]Thank you to... No, we're not.
[428:46.70]Thank you, Eaves, for the $15.
[428:47.58]Thank you for the company at the end of tonight, Jerma.
[428:51.08]Really needed a lot of shit.
[428:52.34]Really needed a lot of shit has happened to me in the last 24 hours, and I really needed to hear your voice.
[428:57.50]Also, I have a question.
[428:58.44]Favorite anime?
[428:59.20]Please don't say FMA.
[429:00.47]I'm going to say FMA.
[429:02.67]I just said it.
[429:06.91]Thank you.
[429:08.43]The Simpsons.
[429:09.67]Thank you, Eaves, for hanging out here.
[429:12.92]And another couple dollars here from EIFS back and forth.
[429:15.70]Also, watch JoJo.
[429:16.88]I just got caught up.
[429:19.00]I just caught up with a big recommend for your next year's one anime per year.
[429:24.08]Get it on there.
[429:24.50]Yep.
[429:25.06]Thank you.
[429:26.62]I will put it on the list.
[429:27.38]Thank you, EIFS, again for the $10.
[429:29.40]And that's this one here.
[429:31.02]Also, just before I go, throw myself down a flight of stouts.
[429:34.54]Whoa.
[429:35.02]Don't throw yourself down a flight of stairs.
[429:36.53]What are you talking about, man?
[429:40.19]Walk down the stairs.
[429:42.32]You don't just slowly walk down and drink some milk.
[429:48.64]Goat's milk.
[429:50.34]And then spit it out.
[429:51.34]And replace it with almond milk.
[429:52.64]And then spit that out.
[429:53.48]Don't drink milk.
[429:54.14]Drink like iced tea.
[429:55.76]With not a whole lot of sugar in it.
[429:58.13]Green tea.
[429:58.73]It's like, you don't want to stay up all that.
[430:01.03]Black tea will keep you up at night.
[430:05.81]But are you going to do more stuff with Kryken and the gang?
[430:08.79]Just wondering.
[430:11.35]Yeah.
[430:14.08]I'm sure I will.
[430:15.91]Like I said, hey, play.
[430:17.15]You can play with Tag, play with Kryken, play with Star, play with Etalyx, play with Vinny.
[430:21.65]I mean, it really is just organically sometimes this shit happens.
[430:25.89]You know, it's not like if a multiplayer game comes out or if there's a lot of interesting things to do, I don't like actively seek out other people to play games with usually.
[430:41.33]It's organically something will come up and it's like, hey, you know what?
[430:44.17]Let me see if they want to play that.
[430:45.73]That sounds like fun.
[430:49.31]It's the same thing with you guys in chat.
[430:50.87]Like, oh, hey, today we're going to play Holdfast.
[430:53.29]A hundred of you, please try to get in the game.
[430:57.36]Just kind of happens.
[431:00.22]But thank you.
[431:02.06]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[431:03.76]Garf here, the animation quality on Rick and Morty got a lot better.
[431:07.80]Luckily, I think the writers realized that the third season wasn't as fun, so they're making the fourth one go back to basics.
[431:14.54]I think it was to let the writers experiment.
[431:17.44]I thought the third one was alright, but I'd be happy to see the show go back to normal.
[431:22.87]Anyway, what other cartoons do you still like?
[431:27.91]I don't really watch cartoons that much.
[431:33.95]Favorite cartoon, I mean, don't, Ren and Snippy, SpongeBob, original SpongeBob, original SpongeBob.
[431:53.10]What's the guy's name?
[431:54.22]Trying to get it right.
[431:58.20]Steven Hillenburg.
[431:59.42]Yeah.
[431:59.74]Back when Steven Hillenburg was in control.
[432:02.90]Way better.
[432:03.99]Way better.
[432:16.47]Agreed.
[432:17.07]He came back.
[432:17.65]He came back?
[432:19.38]What?
[432:33.50]Cool.
[432:34.90]But thank you, Garfield.
[432:35.63]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the $1.
[432:36.95]Hey, Jeremy, you ever think of the idea of making your own FMV type choose your own adventure set in the videos?
[432:41.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[432:44.29]Yeah, we talked about it just a few minutes ago.
[432:47.01]Something I've always wanted to do.
[432:49.29]Maybe if I have a ton of money.
[432:52.00]I'm gonna blow all- you know people like, oh, I lost all my money in the stock market.
[432:55.54]I blew all my money gambling.
[432:57.34]Oh, no, I lost a ton of money.
[432:59.16]Oh, I bought a house and it- If I ever get a bunch of money, the thing that I'm gonna be like, in the room crying about, like, oh, no, I can't believe I- It's gonna be, I made a $500,000 video game video.
[433:11.87]Fuck.
[433:15.55]You know the guy that like, I bet it all on black.
[433:19.35]I bought a house.
[433:29.81]Double zero.
[433:31.71]Thank you, The Cosmonator, for the $1.
[433:35.28]Well, you managed to ramble on enough for me to get enough bits.
[433:37.42]Haha, joke's on you, kid.
[433:39.40]Anyway, you should probably get some sleep.
[433:40.50]I just hope you're proud of this community you've built around your evolved sense of humor that I laugh so hard at.
[433:46.74]Thank you so much for being a comedy genius.
[433:52.16]I'm getting the word genius in here.
[433:55.57]That is very flattering.
[433:56.59]Thank you, Cosmonator.
[434:02.36]Thank you so much, Mick.
[434:05.95]Evolved sense of humor, apparently.
[434:09.55]Mick, I don't know.
[434:11.25]I kind of just like to say dumb shit and I like to talk shit.
[434:15.05]And I think very, very specific scenarios are funny.
[434:18.63]If you also think that, then I'm glad you do.
[434:21.10]And we can all hang out here and have a happy family.
[434:26.38]Pickle Fizz, thanks for the $1.
[434:28.19]One more Hornet meme I did a few days ago.
[434:35.87]This is a Reddit video.
[434:37.87]You got a YouTube link?
[434:41.98]Hold on.
[434:42.44]Actually, I can do this.
[434:44.32]Can I do this in here?
[434:49.18]Let me see.
[434:49.76]Can I actually put this in here and then interact with it?
[434:58.26]I can't.
[435:02.86]Fuck.
[435:06.44]Oh, you do got a YouTube video.
[435:08.20]This video is unavailable.
[435:10.04]This video contains content from Viacom who has blocked it in your country.
[435:19.62]Oops.
[435:26.42]Hold on to that one.
[435:29.22]Maybe we can get it to work.
[435:35.88]Classic Viacom.
[435:38.07]Thank you for the effort, though.
[435:41.43]Whoever invented Reddit video sucks.
[435:44.47]I don't know why.
[435:46.75]But thank you, though.
[435:47.57]Hold on to it.
[435:48.31]Show it to us next stream.
[435:50.73]And then Garfield, the Monday killer, thanks for the $1.
[435:53.64]I forgot the Garf comic!
[435:54.99]Oh, how could we forget the Garfield comics?
[435:59.37]How could we forget?
[436:01.29]Garf comic!
[436:04.19]You must be tonight's Jerma meme, huh?
[436:05.77]Alright, lay it on me.
[436:06.69]That's right, I'm the evil Facebook.
[436:08.95]I'm Satan, I guess.
[436:09.83]I made spiders show up in Jerma's room.
[436:11.43]Family Guy has a funny show.
[436:12.57]Haha.
[436:13.95]Are you gonna do anything besides say stuff Jerma said?
[436:16.00]I made this in 10 minutes, man.
[436:18.00]I gotta stay current to be funny.
[436:19.16]Wait till we make a wasp video.
[436:23.45]Pretty topical.
[436:26.49]Pretty topical.
[436:28.41]Garfield, a.k.a.
[436:32.42]person who is becoming stream villain.
[436:42.60]That's not current anymore?
[436:47.74]Yes, it is.
[436:51.33]What do you mean that's not current?
[436:52.90]That happened like last week.
[437:00.78]That was years ago.
[437:02.88]No, GarfieldTheMondayKiller is way better than the original Garfield.
[437:07.12]Why am I becoming a villain?
[437:11.48]Well, I mean, sentiment in chat, that's how I read sentiment in chat.
[437:15.95]I'm just reading chat sentiments.
[437:20.79]I think Garfield is funny.
[437:21.93]I think Garfield's funnier than real Garfield.
[437:29.46]Yeah, you made a Rick and Morty reference.
[437:32.36]That's like stream villain.
[437:37.66]Be careful.
[437:38.17]I called Twitter the Antichrist.
[437:40.29]I'm done.
[437:42.47]This is my last stream ever, probably.
[437:50.18]She's greater on feet or riot.
[437:59.37]I thought it was Facebook.
[438:00.47]No, we were talking about social media.
[438:01.89]We made like a dumb social media thing about it.
[438:03.55]Social media is awful.
[438:04.71]Social media is going to get you.
[438:05.91]Social media is going to get you one day.
[438:07.91]We were fucking around.
[438:09.91]Didn't matter what it was.
[438:13.40]But thank you, Garfield.
[438:14.30]We all love you.
[438:14.82]I'm just kidding around.
[438:17.60]The Jack.
[438:18.08]Thanks, The Jack, for the $1.
[438:18.94]Will you finish Sorcery 3 already?
[438:20.78]I did.
[438:21.02]What do you mean?
[438:22.24]We beat Sorcery 3 into Sorcery 4.
[438:24.88]What?
[438:26.92]Hey, Mr. Shark of the abortion variety.
[438:31.84]That's way worse saying it like that.
[438:33.48]I'm going to call you.
[438:34.58]People got mad from what I called you.
[438:36.04]Just Abortion Shark.
[438:36.78]That's your name.
[438:38.88]Thank you for the $1.32.
[438:40.32]I'll look into making a shirt.
[438:43.53]Mm-hmm.
[438:45.37]Now, that sounded so awful, and everyone gave me shit for calling you that.
[438:50.45]That's just your chat name, and it's just a... That's it.
[438:55.39]A shark.
[438:58.11]How about a shark?
[438:59.83]A shark.
[439:04.47]A borscht?
[439:05.65]No, that sounds... That's worse.
[439:09.01]A borscht sounds like a Binding of Isaac item.
[439:12.61]No, I don't...
[439:22.64]Don't try to abbreviate it.
[439:28.02]Thank you.
[439:30.08]Thank you, Abortion Shark.
[439:31.45]What's going to say your damn name?
[439:33.23]T-O-K-T-O-K.
[439:34.79]Thanks for the $5.
[439:35.41]Wowie, you're still streaming anyway.
[439:37.03]Good luck with life stuff.
[439:39.17]Sorry you had to play an FMV rip.
[439:42.23]No, you should be glad that we did that.
[439:43.57]That was a bunch of fun.
[439:44.43]I loved the stream tonight.
[439:45.63]I had a blast.
[439:46.47]I have a blast on most of the streams.
[439:49.43]Unless they start with the letter S and end with K-3.
[439:53.96]or they start with the word W and end with World of Warcraft.
[440:01.63]So we had a great time.
[440:05.11]Thank you though.
[440:05.49]Thank you Mara Decao for the $1.
[440:07.11]Hey, I don't know if everyone had shared it with you, but here, two of the dubstep industry's leading producers sampled you in a song earlier this year.
[440:15.06]Wait, what?
[440:22.00]How everybody dies.
[440:28.14]This is how everybody dies.
[440:29.36]This is Datsik in Virtual Riot.
[440:30.90]When did I say that?
[440:31.56]Louder.
[441:00.89]Link, link, link, link.
[441:02.17]Here's the link.
[441:04.27]It starts right when I say the word.
[441:05.79]Soon?
[441:06.19]What?
[441:06.95]What are you talking about?
[441:14.02]Soon for FMV funds?
[441:19.18]Why are you guys immediately going?
[441:20.58]They sampled my voice for like a quarter of a second.
[441:31.53]We need money.
[441:33.43]No, we're fine.
[441:34.13]Don't worry.
[441:36.24]That's really cool, though.
[441:37.20]I mean, I don't really listen to dubstep at all.
[441:40.32]But that's cool.
[441:42.82]They're pretty popular, it seems.
[441:46.32]That's pretty cool.
[441:48.06]Cool.
[441:48.82]Yeah, cool.
[441:49.58]That's all I can say.
[441:58.42]YouTube link.
[441:59.28]Got it.
[442:00.62]But thank you, Maritical.
[442:03.10]That's cool.
[442:04.56]Hey, TheJack473, thanks for the $1 play.
[442:06.54]Some swindle stones to ready you for that new Vegas gambling lifestyle.
[442:10.70]The game to play is Baccarat.
[442:13.69]It's really easy to learn.
[442:15.43]It's got a tiny, minuscule house edge.
[442:18.31]It's one of the best games to play at the whole casino.
[442:20.03]Just don't bet too much money.
[442:22.59]Thank you, Peanut, for the $1.
[442:25.07]At the very end here, this is it.
[442:28.57]Somebody made a wasp, inconspicuous username, made a wasp video.
[442:33.91]Okay.
[442:38.88]Alright.
[442:40.10]This is a full-on current movie spoiler.
[442:46.18]So I'm gonna link this one.
[442:50.66]I don't know if I can play this one on stream because this movie is like still in theaters.
[442:56.47]So I don't think I can, master of comedy.
[443:03.20]Everyone, alright, listen, here's what's gonna happen.
[443:07.69]If you have not seen Infinity War,
[443:11.36]The stream's over after this, by the way.
[443:13.22]Have a great night.
[443:14.48]See you soon.
[443:15.80]Take care.
[443:16.58]See you on Friday.

[443:20.97]Thank you so much.
[443:24.01]Leave now if you don't want to see an Infinity War spoiler.
[443:26.43]That's all I'm telling you right now.
[443:27.69]It's about to happen.
[443:28.49]This is not even kidding.
[443:30.25]This is, like, the very end of the whole fucking movie.
[443:33.06]This is the last, like, minute of the movie.
[443:35.88]So, there you go.
[443:40.79]Your last chance to leave.
[443:41.85]Have a great night.
[443:49.15]This is when you need to leave.
[443:50.91]Like, right now.
[443:57.59]Wait till he lands.
[443:58.89]Wait till he lands.
[444:01.66]Okay, he landed.
[444:04.10]Oh, man.
[444:08.66]Ooh, up in smoke!
[444:19.82]What the fuck?
[444:20.36]Spoilers?
[444:21.10]I just spent like a full 30 to 40 seconds begging you to leave if you haven't seen the movie.
[444:36.91]I didn't spoil the movie.
[444:38.23]I was very courteous and I tried.
[444:40.07]I tried my absolute hardest.
[444:43.38]He just got here.
[444:44.38]Fuck.
[444:44.84]No, that's not true, right?
[444:49.44]It doesn't matter.
[444:50.02]I'm gonna, okay.
[444:51.70]I gotta, I gotta, uh, how do I make this right?
[444:55.03]Um, um, I just got here.
[445:00.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[445:10.06]I gotta get out of here.
[445:10.82]I gotta go.
[445:12.18]I gotta go.
[445:19.90]Now, have a great night, guys.
[445:20.96]But, AbortionShark, thanks for the dollar.
[445:22.54]32, sorry for making you say my name.
[445:23.61]That's fine, dude.
[445:24.33]Don't worry about it.
[445:25.05]Madical, thanks for the one dollar.
[445:26.69]Donating another dollar so you can start saying my name right.
[445:29.19]Try saying radical with ma.
[445:31.31]Madical.
[445:34.60]So, it's madical.
[445:37.94]Try saying radical with ma.
[445:39.36]Madical.
[445:41.25]Alright, there we go.
[445:41.87]Madical.
[445:42.65]Hey, Asian Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[445:44.02]Hey, I mentioned this when the hornets breached a room and you cut the bit short, but I majored in entomology.
[445:50.20]Anyway, a good way to get rid of pests inside or around your home is to consume at least 32 ounces of said insect.
[445:55.83]After a certain amount of consumption, you'll notice the insect population decrease significantly.
[446:14.91]Okay, good night.
[446:16.73]Goodbye.
[446:18.09]Have a great night.
[446:19.33]By the way, Infinity War is a great movie.
[446:22.37]That is really good.
[446:23.35]Josh Brolin fucking kills it as Thanos.
[446:26.03]It's a fucking great movie.
[446:27.88]Alright.
[446:28.88]Good night, everybody.
[446:31.40]I'll see you on Friday.
[446:33.46]Have a great night.
[446:37.94]I liked it.
[446:38.84]I liked Josh Brolin, so I liked Thanos.
[446:40.84]I liked Infinity War.
[446:43.33]I base all of my, if I liked a movie or not, based on if I liked one guy in the movie, then I really liked him.
[446:54.37]I got to get out of here.
[446:54.93]Alright, I got to go.
[446:57.87]I got to get out of here.
[446:58.53]I'm not even kidding.
[446:59.11]I got to go.
[447:00.01]I got to get out of here.
