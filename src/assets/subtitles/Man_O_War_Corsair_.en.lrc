[07:20.55]Oh god, I can't even read that shit.
[07:23.81]Does anybody remember?
[07:24.57]All I remember from this game is I had a lot of problems with the wind.
[07:30.50]Lord Crispy Cream Crisp.
[07:32.58]The time is right.
[07:33.30]It is foretold.
[07:35.00]This kissfuls are weak.

[07:44.39]Slaughter them!
[07:47.94]W-A-D-S.
[07:49.76]Yep.
[07:51.80]I feel like this boat just doesn't need to exist.
[07:53.58]Hold G is to zoom.
[07:54.66]Thank God they have a little dumb tutorial.
[08:01.91]I'm trying to fucking do a thing.
[08:03.83]Aim.
[08:04.69]And this is adjust, aim, and fire.
[08:06.05]Okay.
[08:09.59]Alright, let's go.
[08:12.38]I'm in combat.
[08:14.86]We have two different types of ammo, if I remember...
[08:19.20]I think, is that going to reach?
[08:21.60]Ooh, direct shot, baby.
[08:24.28]Change weapon is R or 1, 2, 3.
[08:26.30]Okay.
[08:31.44]Didn't hit him.
[08:33.99]Let's try a different weapon.
[08:38.19]Holy shit, that's a flamethrower.
[08:40.23]Wow.
[08:42.29]That was awesome.
[08:43.31]What is 3?
[08:43.55]Oh, man.
[08:45.65]What the fuck is that?
[08:48.98]I bite the ship?
[08:51.90]We're going to take a chunk out of these guys.
[08:53.52]This is gonna be insane.
[08:54.30]Okay, here we go.
[08:58.41]And they're on fire and bite them!
[09:02.85]Let's board it!
[09:05.51]Board the ship, boys!
[09:07.67]I get a shield?
[09:08.49]Uh, attack, strong attack, block?
[09:13.47]What is this, Dark Souls?
[09:16.87]How do I... Where am I?
[09:18.47]Alright, here we go.
[09:23.31]Smash this guy.
[09:23.95]Alright, I instantly killed that guy.
[09:28.62]These guys are fucking weak as hell.
[09:34.10]Is there a sprint?
[09:36.96]That guy's the captain right there.
[09:41.56]Good thing I have Diablo back here.
[09:44.90]Oh, you guys thought you could fuck with Diablo!
[09:49.33]That was a pretty sick fake-out move, Diablo.
[09:54.47]Oh, shit!
[10:00.61]Alright, we got it.
[10:02.15]You can actually go inside?
[10:03.37]Okay, that's really cool.
[10:05.41]Let's go in.
[10:07.65]Oh, no.
[10:08.05]I guess not.
[10:09.42]I just had to go up and down.
[10:13.59]Who else is left?
[10:14.91]One guy here.
[10:15.47]That's it, right?
[10:21.46]Victory?
[10:21.82]No, there's one more guy.
[10:24.72]Got him.
[10:26.22]Kill the enemy crew.
[10:28.20]We got it.
[10:28.64]Take their fucking gold.
[10:31.72]Thank you very much.
[10:35.02]And now we're back on this boat.
[10:36.04]Alright, got it.
[10:36.46]Cool.
[10:38.96]Alright, this is way more fun than it was last time.
[10:46.06]Like, this shit is fucking awesome.
[10:48.42]You can actually tab target now.
[10:51.74]That's really, really great stuff.
[10:53.66]Alright, let's burn the shit out of this and do the same thing.
[10:58.32]Burn him.
[10:59.60]Full speed ahead.
[11:01.00]Going in with the claw.
[11:04.42]Nice.
[11:04.66]Just gotta get close enough.
[11:09.34]Let's burn him again.
[11:09.94]Fuck it.
[11:11.07]Just spray the fuck out of him.
[11:14.43]Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to adjust your... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:17.46]Alright, let's go.
[11:18.50]Time to get in.
[11:19.18]Go for a bite.
[11:24.38]So can I fight the giant monsters with this ship?
[11:29.10]That would be so much more fun.
[11:32.54]Let's go in for a crane machine.
[11:38.06]Who wants... Oh.
[11:40.36]I actually hit that.
[11:41.08]Okay.
[11:43.04]I didn't think I hit that.
[11:46.85]I can't wait to fight the narwhal with my own narwhal.
[11:49.21]Let's go.
[11:51.56]Do I have any other weapons or just these?
[11:54.90]Let's get down to the level down here.
[12:00.02]I can eat boats with my boat.
[12:05.46]That's fantastic.
[12:08.62]Okay, I'm on fire.
[12:13.37]Oh, where is he?
[12:16.72]I'm not done I feel much more comfortable.
[12:22.40]I had a weapon like a gun not necessarily a sword Alright, let's go monster hunting I don't care about these like dinky humans These humans are fucking worthless
[12:45.85]I want me and my crew to take on the big bad guys.
[12:49.01]Who's left?
[12:55.23]Well, they're all focusing on one guy over here.
[13:01.16]What was that?
[13:01.78]They had two bottles of wine on this ship.
[13:07.32]Oh, nice work.
[13:08.30]There's one more.
[13:10.56]This is the tutorial, by the way, so...
[13:14.40]It will open up after this, I'm going to assume.
[13:20.71]The best part is people are making orc jokes when this is clearly chaos.
[13:30.09]Yeah, this is, this is, these aren't orcs.
[13:35.03]J buffet ship.
[13:39.30]I got famous.
[13:43.44]Fuck it, dude.
[13:43.90]Let's just crush it.
[13:44.75]I think that's it, right?
[13:45.73]Alright, there we go.
[13:46.51]We're good.
[13:49.39]Excellent, Lord Krispy Kreme.
[13:51.49]How do I change the camera?
[13:52.43]That's not camera.
[13:53.17]But whatever.
[13:53.53]So do I actually get to invade ports?
[13:54.77]Or not?
[14:15.16]30 knots, 27 knots.
[14:19.30]I think I could have picked up something back there, by the way.
[14:21.66]How does the map look now, too?
[14:22.86]Did they change it?
[14:25.59]It looks about the same.
[14:26.33]Am I close enough to hit this?
[14:36.96]Uh... Oh, shit.
[14:37.96]These are the Lannisters.
[14:43.19]A Lannister never wins.
[14:45.15]Whatever their line is.
[14:51.24]Look at all the blood on the deck of the ship.
[14:52.68]Yeah, they sacrificed their enemy.
[14:55.04]It's telling me to focus on the tower.
[15:00.00]I feel... Oh, there we go.
[15:04.46]Did you guys hear that guy that just said, Yeah!
[15:07.18]Yeah!
[15:07.60]Yeah!
[15:11.95]Sail up to the pier, we shall reap a bloody harvest.
[15:15.01]Alright.
[15:17.99]This thing needs to go.
[15:23.83]Atlantis never forgets.
[15:27.02]Let's plunder it.
[15:30.92]Oh no, don't even tell me.
[15:31.90]It's just, hey, you did this.
[15:38.08]Wow!
[15:38.76]Okay, hold on.
[15:39.82]This was not in the game before.
[15:44.14]There's people just everywhere.
[15:48.10]Okay, this is kind of lame.
[15:50.21]This is a little lame.
[15:51.59]Where are you going?
[16:05.33]Come on, come get me lady!
[16:10.85]Look at that guy up there.
[16:12.69]Look at people just shooting guns.
[16:14.07]Alright, you know what this reminds me of?
[16:20.07]So you know when you go to like a goofy recess baseball game or kickball and everybody has to put the bat in the ground and spin around a shitload and then go kick the ball for kickball?
[16:30.26]That's what this is.
[16:31.66]Every single one of us had to put the bat on the ground and spin, spin, spin, spin, spin and now we're fighting.
[16:37.72]That's what this is.
[16:43.30]Oh wow, I'm just getting fucking destroyed, lady.
[16:52.21]But the only point is I have like a Diablo.
[16:54.21]They don't get a Diablo.
[16:55.35]How is this fair?
[16:57.51]This is not fair.
[17:03.12]And what does this one mean?
[17:04.40]What does the icon on his head mean?
[17:08.41]We both missed.
[17:10.69]We both suck.
[17:13.45]He just fell down.
[17:23.17]Okay.
[17:31.67]How do we win this?
[17:35.92]Just keep clashing, who cares?
[17:38.58]Oh, one of my big green guys died.
[17:40.42]As long as Diablo survives, I don't care.
[17:44.67]Diablo's just walking around.
[17:47.89]Oh, it's like a mascot fight.
[17:54.85]It's the mascots versus the baseball team.
[17:59.13]This dude clearly is a mascot, right?
[18:01.81]Lookit.
[18:03.79]That guy is... When is this gonna be over?
[18:15.07]Oh, nice.
[18:15.53]Good job, mascots.
[18:18.27]Now, when this is over, make sure we do like a trampoline slam dunk.
[18:23.03]It'll make people real happy.
[18:25.55]We win.
[18:27.96]And cannibalize.
[18:32.15]Eh.
[18:33.11]Cannibalize them all.
[18:34.17]Eat them.
[18:38.47]Great Corn is pleased with you, Lord Krispy Kreme.
[18:40.81]Join me in the shrine room and we'll petition him for favor.
[18:43.06]Okay.
[18:46.64]Where the fuck is that?
[18:48.58]Shrine?
[18:50.42]Petition?
[18:53.47]Petition.
[18:53.93]Okay.
[18:57.25]Okay.
[19:02.46]Summon the fleet.
[19:03.04]Alright, I want to fight a monster, though.
[19:06.97]Are there no monsters in the open?
[19:12.25]I'm curious as to how that works now.
[19:13.63]Command menu.
[19:14.27]Wait, you get to have fleets?
[19:18.21]Yeah, just follow me.
[19:20.84]How do I get them just to follow me?
[19:21.82]Fleet.
[19:24.26]All ships.
[19:25.28]Follow.
[19:28.16]I don't even know what... Oh my god.
[19:30.26]Okay, are these...
[19:32.83]Jesus.
[19:37.26]Let's burn the shipyards at Erangard.
[19:38.78]Okay.
[19:39.36]So sail to Erangard, I guess.
[19:45.79]Where's Erangard?
[19:46.45]Right here.
[19:47.67]So we gotta go just straight ahead.
[19:49.01]Alright, let's move.
[19:54.19]Actual time?
[19:55.39]Decrease speed, increase time speed.
[19:57.34]Could you do this before?
[20:00.82]Times four.
[20:01.48]Alright, we're at times four speed right now.
[20:05.00]This is... Oh, that's perfect.
[20:06.28]Times four.
[20:11.72]Speed it up.
[20:15.10]Maybe that's only in the other game?
[20:18.26]Like the other game mode?
[20:21.02]Oh, boy.
[20:24.22]Alright, we'll turn this... Turn this down to like... Alright, the weakling sent reinforcements over to the fleet to attack the ships.
[20:31.30]Alright, all ships attack.
[20:36.01]Attack that one.
[20:36.97]Alright, let's go for it.
[20:40.23]Full speed ahead.
[20:42.31]What's the name of this game?
[20:42.91]This is Manowar Corsair.
[20:47.71]And there is multiple things to do.
[20:48.93]This is just, I guess, one of the game modes that we hadn't seen before.
[20:55.97]But it is... I think it's like 30 bucks.
[20:58.21]Something like that.
[21:00.19]I think it's still in early access.
[21:03.53]But it looks like they've added a substantial amount since like six or seven months ago, which is the last time I played.
[21:10.06]So, yeah.
[21:13.88]We'll see.
[21:14.46]I want to see like one of the new monsters too, if we get a chance.
[21:21.60]Corsair RGB mechanical keyboard, yeah.
[21:26.44]Now, let's go with this one.
[21:28.80]My main concern is the fact that we're all going after this one ship.
[21:35.84]Maybe I should have split them up.
[21:36.80]Because every single one of my crew is going over here.
[21:42.33]I guess that's what's going to happen.
[21:43.39]Okay.
[21:50.98]This looks stupid.
[21:51.84]Stupid!
[21:52.18]Alright, let's speed up time a little bit here.
[21:55.60]Well, it's starting to lag a little, but it's alright.
[22:01.30]I'm gonna get him with the claw.
[22:05.94]One of us will eventually get there.
[22:07.16]Alright, we're getting close.
[22:08.14]He can board that ship.
[22:09.42]We just gotta get close enough.
[22:12.92]He's right up this guy's ass.
[22:16.70]Kinda getting fucked up right now, but where does this guy think he's going?
[22:21.00]Where are you going?
[22:22.74]You thought you were going to drive?
[22:25.33]You can't do that.
[22:26.93]That's not going to work.
[22:29.15]Jesus.
[22:30.85]Oh, no.
[22:32.21]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[22:34.45]Guys.
[22:35.26]Guys, listen.
[22:36.34]Listen, listen.
[22:36.98]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[22:38.08]Not everybody can do this at the same time.
[22:41.24]Now we just made a fucking traffic jam.
[22:50.07]Guys!
[22:50.55]You're supposed to attack the ship!
[22:54.79]You're supposed to- No.
[22:57.25]They're all just crashing into each other.
[23:05.55]Oh my god.
[23:09.70]Well, I don't- Push off, please.

[24:58.28]That guy got an explosion and landed on that guy.
[25:01.30]The boat is sinking.
[25:05.28]How much is left for this boat?
[25:08.68]This thing has to be ready to die.
[25:13.32]How are they going to react when this thing sinks?
[25:17.14]Right?
[25:19.02]I'm so... I need to know what these people do.
[25:21.80]Okay, it's sinking.
[25:24.32]What do they do?
[25:27.14]They're still standing around.
[25:31.61]I... I don't know if we were invisible or not.

[25:39.71]Alright, well... Okay.
[25:44.46]Okay.
[25:47.83]Let's go get these guys.
[25:51.38]These two are stuck inside of each other.

[25:56.42]That is what's going on, right?
[25:57.42]Or is that, is that two boats?
[25:58.48]I think that's two.
[26:04.73]Yeah, it is.
[26:06.87]Oh, fuck it.
[26:07.41]Whatever.
[26:09.53]The music in the background makes it, it really does.
[26:15.62]Alright, let's get on their boat.
[26:24.75]These people at least will fight.
[26:29.82]The dude raised his hands to fight.
[26:35.52]Didn't do anything.
[26:39.00]That guy was cheering on his crewmates.
[26:42.12]And died.
[26:42.60]Something might be in trouble here.
[26:47.72]Kind of getting fucked up.
[26:48.80]There's this guy with the gun.
[26:50.84]This guy with the gun's gotta go.
[26:54.48]Oh no.
[26:55.74]Is there a sprint?
[26:56.22]There's fucking Captain Blackbeard over here shooting a gun.
[27:01.66]Just get behind them.
[27:05.89]I just got hit with like the moron swing.
[27:14.03]One more.
[27:17.73]Hey, he's dead.
[27:18.81]Your captain's dead.
[27:20.25]Where's my crew?
[27:22.43]Do I have anybody left?
[27:27.60]It's just this one lady.
[27:28.78]No, I have one guy.
[27:39.15]My last guy.
[27:40.87]I have faith.
[27:41.73]Let's watch him.
[27:48.69]Good.
[27:49.37]You came pretty close.
[27:50.31]Wow, that guy... That guy just pretend swung at you.
[27:53.67]And you're dead.
[27:55.82]He died so bad that he went, like, into the... Well, I have to beat these guys.
[28:00.82]I gotta beat, like, the fucking Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[28:02.78]They're both twins.
[28:05.28]The two twins.
[28:06.28]The last remaining survivors.
[28:13.25]Jesus.
[28:14.77]Where's my... Oh, my health is above me.
[28:21.11]Fucking outta here.
[28:23.56]Give me all your shit.
[28:25.36]What?
[28:26.58]Oh.
[28:29.24]Yeah, Diablo's dead.
[28:37.17]I ain't boarding this ship because I don't have any crew members left.
[28:39.35]So we're just going to take this out with old-fashioned cannon fire.
[28:43.65]You know what I mean?
[28:50.14]Kind of scared, but I think there's two boats here.
[29:01.63]Just sink them.
[29:02.75]I ain't dealing with this right now.
[29:04.11]Sink these fucking assholes.
[29:05.13]I think the boat's not on fire yet.
[29:11.52]This is a very tough ship.
[29:17.40]Do you think I can kill all of them?
[29:19.48]I might be able to kill everybody, honestly.
[29:23.43]It's possible.
[29:24.03]Let's do it.
[29:25.21]I'm killing all these people.
[29:26.93]I've got to be smart about it.
[29:28.03]You know what I mean?
[29:33.40]I've just got to be smart.
[29:34.98]Keep injuring.
[29:36.46]Keep shooting.
[29:40.94]And this is where we grab.
[29:42.08]And we board.
[29:47.57]This is where we board.
[29:48.35]Alright.
[29:48.67]Here we go.
[29:52.15]It's me, Captain Krispy Kreme, taking on the whole fucking crew.
[29:56.43]You guys don't think I can do this?
[29:59.47]There's only like three people on this boat.
[30:02.65]This is gonna be so easy.
[30:03.47]Oh, there's a guy with a shotgun over here.
[30:06.02]Okay, well, fine.
[30:09.58]Okay, this guy with the shotgun.
[30:22.49]Done.
[30:24.89]Only, like, one more guy.
[30:26.90]And I mean one more guy quite literally, because it's the same model.
[30:31.10]Another twin situation.
[30:35.12]Oh, wow.
[30:35.72]That was a counterattack.
[30:36.74]That's worth more damage.
[30:40.74]I win.
[30:44.07]Right?
[30:46.97]Oh, no.
[30:47.41]No.
[30:47.77]Apparently not.
[30:49.65]Apparently these guys were still around.
[30:55.44]Where's my fleet?
[30:56.60]Hold on.
[30:57.72]Fleet.
[30:59.12]All ships.
[31:00.52]Get over here.
[31:02.98]All ships reporting for duty.
[31:07.24]I need you.
[31:07.98]And my mouse is on the screen now.
[31:13.44]Why is my mouse on the screen?

[31:55.17]Come on.
[31:56.67]I'm having a train of people following me.
[32:03.47]Nobody decided to go this way.
[32:04.83]I love it.
[32:06.63]Get over here.
[32:09.99]Yes, yes.
[32:16.41]What happened to all those people?
[32:20.79]I think they all walked off.
[32:23.68]All those fucking people walked off the edge and I didn't see it.
[32:27.40]No way.
[32:28.18]No fucking way I missed that.
[32:31.34]I did not expect that at all.
[32:32.91]Why would they fucking walk off the edge?
[32:35.27]And how did I not get that on screen?
[32:41.19]Wow.
[32:43.25]I'm actually very, very mad about that.
[32:51.62]I'm very upset that I didn't see that.
[32:58.95]Get this mouse out of here.
[33:00.13]Come on.
[33:03.63]Oh, it's going to be like a mouse stream from here on out.
[33:05.55]Okay.
[33:08.69]Did the boat burn down?
[33:09.61]No, I don't think so.
[33:10.63]I mean, it did, but... Alright, let's get rid of this.
[33:19.84]So I just realized something.
[33:20.68]How are we going to...
[33:24.74]Is it just going to be me versus everybody here?
[33:30.57]Hopefully this is not just me.
[33:32.15]Hopefully we get Diablo back.
[33:33.77]Yep, nice.
[33:34.63]I think Diablo's dead.
[33:39.49]Okay, we still have our mascots.
[33:44.73]Now, after this, I kind of want to see what the other monster is.
[33:49.25]Okay.
[33:54.30]It's just a random magician with a giant fucking turkey leg.
[33:59.60]Who is this guy?
[34:02.59]What's with like the club?
[34:06.01]And these guys just have like tomahawks and like battle axes.
[34:09.41]And there's one guy with like a club.
[34:11.19]Like a turkey leg club.
[34:14.92]I feel like that guy is a Dark Souls character.
[34:16.84]I'm doing PvP right now and that's somebody that's like making like a... I'm using like the club!
[34:26.27]Dude, I don't know if you should be here right now.
[34:28.65]I'm trying to tell you.
[34:30.19]He just placed a... That guy's not dead.
[34:33.45]He's pretending to be dead.
[34:36.07]I slashed at him once and he was like, oh fuck, I'm not ready for this.
[34:38.37]I better pretend to be dead.
[34:39.73]And then he dropped his glove.
[34:41.01]He's still alive.
[34:43.62]You can't fucking fool me, buddy.
[34:51.30]Smart, though.
[34:52.16]Very smart, dude.
[35:07.53]I love this game.
[35:10.45]This game is so charming.
[35:15.46]Especially the big monster part.
[35:19.14]I don't care if it's like, derpy and like, shitty.
[35:21.42]This game's fucking awesome.
[35:28.20]Do I get to learn any new moves or get any new items?
[35:34.97]Somebody has a gun.
[35:35.71]That's a huge gun.
[35:40.13]This guy can't even hit me.
[35:46.01]Oh, he put it away!
[35:47.88]He wanted to slow motion swing at me.
[35:49.88]Alright, we're gonna be in super speed.
[36:00.56]Alright, super speed is fucking awesome.
[36:02.24]Hold on.
[36:06.92]Oh, I can't go slower than that.
[36:17.22]Oh, it's a lady with a turkey leg.
[36:18.61]Oh, she's dead.
[36:23.01]Too fast.
[36:23.65]Oh, there's the guy with the gun.
[36:32.97]Am I dead?
[36:39.05]Ow.
[36:39.63]It's too much speed.
[36:42.84]Where did I get two Diablos from?
[36:49.18]Okay, that's fine.
[36:53.40]I will take my two Diablo reinforcements.
[36:56.22]We're gonna lose.
[36:57.73]The game didn't want me to lose.
[37:01.03]I got my Zerg rush.
[37:08.98]I was dead.
[37:12.57]See, I told you this guy was still alive.
[37:14.99]I told you.
[37:16.65]I fucking told you.
[37:18.35]He got back up.
[37:21.83]He's currently just scared.
[37:23.03]He's just standing here scared.
[37:26.87]Is anybody gonna do anything about this guy?
[37:28.54]Did somebody kill this guy?
[37:34.28]He's making it away.
[37:38.49]Somebody hit him.
[37:40.75]Hit him.
[37:45.25]Diablo II from Pirate of the Year.
[37:47.68]This is taking so long.
[37:51.18]This is taking an extremely long time.
[37:53.48]This town must have a thousand people in it.
[38:01.64]Can't somebody just drop a fucking grenade in here?
[38:06.14]At this point.
[38:08.76]Can somebody roll a fucking grenade down here?
[38:11.90]There's even more people.
[38:15.48]Diablo.
[38:22.15]Diablo's just getting... He's just swinging his grenade.
[38:28.49]He's just...
[38:30.96]I love this.
[38:31.84]I'm gonna die.
[38:32.48]Why?
[38:40.19]Why are there more people?
[38:44.09]Slay the port's defenders?
[38:45.59]Like I've been doing that for like fucking 10 minutes.
[38:50.13]How many more people have to die?
[38:52.62]And how many more fucking people have to fucking deal with Diablo the baby in the baby costume?
[38:59.48]There's a baby in a costume just running around bumping into stuff.
[39:03.94]That's not even Diablo.
[39:07.56]Some fucking little baby.
[39:12.80]Look at the top.
[39:14.55]17 more fucking people have to die?
[39:16.33]Oh my god.
[39:19.75]There's not even fucking 19 more people to kill.
[39:21.79]Alright, just load them up here.
[39:30.23]Just stuff them up here.
[39:31.13]God, what a fucking idiot.
[39:37.53]Oh my god.
[39:38.21]I'm gonna die.
[39:39.81]Like, like, we have 34, they have 12.
[39:44.85]Do you guys see 34 people?
[39:48.59]I don't.
[40:04.38]Please just die.
[40:05.14]Please end my misery.
[40:09.33]This better give me an achievement.
[40:15.31]I swear if I die, I'll be very mad.
[40:19.70]So the good part is the sea monster, yes.
[40:22.76]The sea monster is the fun part of the game.
[40:25.12]This is fun.
[40:27.08]This is fun because...
[40:29.89]I am enjoying this right now.
[40:31.77]You guys might not think I am, but I am.
[40:34.55]Very much so.
[40:35.77]Alright, five left.
[40:41.30]Don't get shot with a person with a gun.
[40:49.06]The last thing I need is to get sniped.
[40:51.18]Okay, we win.
[40:56.43]Holy fuck.
[40:59.84]Uh, okay, raise it.
[41:05.14]Erangard has been destroyed.

[41:24.59]All ships, follow.
[41:29.40]Okay.
[41:31.75]Do you guys think that the monsters show up here?
[41:41.05]We're going to sail into the sea for a little bit and see if we can run into a monster.
[41:44.74]If we don't run into a monster.
[41:48.24]Here we go.
[41:48.60]Oh, these are the beasts I've encountered.

[42:27.60]Can I put a mark on there?
[42:28.54]Yeah, let's go there.
[42:31.38]Alright, let's go.
[42:42.17]Ooh, don't crash on me, game.
[42:43.29]Come on.
[42:48.05]Okay.

[43:00.30]Alright, sacrifice... Oh, I can... Sigmund!
[43:08.53]Sacrifice Diablo.
[43:12.03]Uh, let's sacrifice a gold bar.
[43:13.19]I don't even know what this is gonna do.
[43:18.29]I... I don't know.
[43:22.77]Cultist?
[43:25.60]Alright, I got like... Oh no, we're going all Diablos.
[43:30.30]Yeah, fuck this.
[43:32.44]You guys think I'm fucking around right now?
[43:37.45]Yeah, don't worry.
[43:39.45]By the way, what are these names for these demons?
[43:43.33]John?
[43:46.71]All of you guys fuck off.
[43:48.29]All of you.
[43:49.43]And I mean every fucking single one of you.
[44:00.56]That's what I thought.
[44:03.10]You know what we got a fucking full crew of right now, guys?
[44:06.04]All Diablos.
[44:11.60]Shit just got real.
[44:14.12]Shit just got real.
[44:16.04]Only Diablos.
[44:18.80]Perfect.
[44:25.06]Well, those aren't really Diablos.
[44:26.66]I mean, they're like mini Diablos.
[44:31.92]These guys are gonna suck.
[44:46.06]Captain Crunch and the baby squad.
[44:58.81]We're getting closer.
[44:59.49]Let's see what the monster is.
[45:06.53]Alright, so where are we?
[45:10.43]We're so far away.
[45:11.63]Holy shit.
[45:16.84]I love how they're just walking around.
[45:32.86]Come on, hurry up.
[45:35.77]Hurry up.
[45:40.21]It's getting to be daytime, too, which is good.
[45:44.42]Turn up the speed.
[45:45.26]I think that's as high as it can go.
[45:52.20]Why is the deck covered in blood?
[45:53.22]Because we are the chaos spawn.
[45:57.97]And we're inching ever so closer to the circle.
[46:03.17]It's been over an hour since the last Madlib.
[46:05.46]Unprofessional.
[46:06.58]Unprofessional.
[46:16.99]I can't wait for my baby.
[46:18.55]I can't wait for my babies in costumes.
[46:21.15]Crew.
[46:22.53]To fuck people up.
[46:23.55]It's going to be amazing.
[46:30.20]After this, where's the nearest port?
[46:32.14]Okay, well, we're getting there.
[46:39.16]Slowly but surely.
[46:46.48]But like I said, I actually do enjoy this game.
[46:48.14]This game is actually fun to me.
[46:53.82]It is very, very... On the... Not so polished side at the moment, but... It's something about it that's very endearing.
[47:06.53]What is that?
[47:08.17]Ship?
[47:09.35]There's another ship right here.
[47:11.53]Let's put it to the test.
[47:14.91]Let's put our baby Diablos to the test.
[47:17.29]Nice miss.
[47:22.88]Alright, come on.
[47:29.41]Oh, fuck.
[47:33.25]What is that symbol?
[47:36.33]Hopefully I haven't lost any baby Diablos yet.
[47:41.88]Not quite, but we're gonna be fine.
[47:43.08]Come on.
[47:49.36]Everybody, all crew, all ships.
[47:51.70]All ships attack this guy.
[47:55.59]That went right through his fucking crotch.
[47:57.43]Give me a break.
[47:59.85]There we go.
[48:01.69]Come on!
[48:04.63]Wow, what is with this maneuvering?
[48:06.15]Bullshit.
[48:12.96]This guy can turn on a dime.
[48:17.74]Grab him.
[48:20.14]Come on, grab him.
[48:22.11]You had such a huge opportunity.
[48:23.39]Nice job.
[48:24.05]Good.
[48:25.53]We're going in for a grab part two.
[48:29.53]No, we're turned into the wind.
[48:32.87]Oh, come on.
[48:35.51]Get on.
[48:36.71]Board it.
[48:37.93]Board the ship.
[48:38.57]Come on.
[48:39.55]Whoa.
[48:44.05]Whoa.
[48:46.86]Oh, geez.
[48:48.44]Come on, man.
[48:49.34]What is this turn?
[48:50.88]He's turning so hard.
[48:52.28]That harsh fucking turn.
[48:56.22]Boats can't do that.
[49:02.97]Alright.
[49:03.27]I got a chance here.
[49:03.95]Let's try to grab him.
[49:16.89]Shoot him.
[49:18.67]Come on, board him.
[49:20.55]It really doesn't help that... Shouldn't I have an opportunity to board right now?
[49:28.12]Apparently not.
[49:29.24]Somebody has died.
[49:30.94]Who died?
[49:46.31]Put your babies on a diet.
[49:54.98]I think there might be a monster coming over here.
[49:59.04]Everything just got really, really... Alright, come on.
[50:05.08]There we go.
[50:05.44]Floored it.
[50:07.28]Perfect opportunity.
[50:08.06]Here we go.
[50:09.50]Let's go, Diablos.
[50:11.26]They crawl up the side, too.
[50:12.36]That's so awesome.
[50:18.12]Alright, what do we got?
[50:22.10]Who is this guy?
[50:23.22]I thought I fired everybody.
[50:24.20]Is this guy not damageable?
[50:30.56]These guys have actual armor.
[50:41.36]Felix the deserter.
[50:42.22]Well, he's actually very easy to kill.
[50:43.70]Never mind, he's dead.
[50:48.93]I fired this guy.
[50:56.87]There's 23 people on this spot.
[51:02.08]Oh wow, everyone's losing.
[51:03.44]Alright, come on!
[51:06.54]Go get him, baby Diablo!
[51:10.38]Nice job!
[51:11.42]Nice work.
[51:13.82]You climbed over and looked at the guy.
[51:23.06]I gotta make this happen.
[51:23.96]Because obviously the baby Diablos are not gonna do it.
[51:31.99]What did that just say?
[51:35.89]23 crew.
[51:42.45]I can't fire my first mate?
[51:44.25]What if I want to make first mate a baby Diablo?
[51:51.32]Where is this?
[51:51.76]Another boat just came over here?
[51:52.98]Alright, come on.
[51:56.10]Just kill him already.
[52:00.16]I'm glad this guy came up here to be scared.
[52:06.37]Oh, God.
[52:09.99]Hit him.
[52:10.95]Hit him.
[52:12.51]Nice.
[52:19.68]Oh, my God!
[52:22.90]What?
[52:23.22]I'm just getting lit up by machine guns.
[52:27.60]Oh, fuck.
[52:29.42]No wonder why everybody's dying.
[52:34.71]Oh, no.
[52:35.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:36.55]Get back on the boat.
[52:37.93]Did I change ship?
[52:38.81]Oh.
[52:42.87]I'm just gonna make him take off his gun.
[52:47.87]Oh, fuck.
[52:48.98]I'm so dead.
[52:50.72]Dude, seriously, I don't know why that guy gets that kind of gun.
[52:55.66]What the fuck?
[53:02.13]This guy has a fucking machine gun.
[53:04.21]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[53:08.25]Oh, shit.
[53:09.21]Don't kill me.
[53:10.10]Don't kill me.
[53:11.14]Don't do it.
[53:12.50]Just pretend we were never here.
[53:36.23]Why did that dude get a hand cannon like that?
[53:39.99]Oh my god That is such a crock of shit really
[53:48.67]I got a machine gun.
[53:49.29]He had like a hand cannon thing.
[53:53.25]Well, alright.
[53:53.89]Let's just go fight a monster.
[53:55.59]For real.
[54:00.29]R.I.P.
[54:00.67]Krispy Kreme.
[54:01.41]I know.
[54:07.49]No save.
[54:09.35]I actually forgot that this game had like quick saves.
[54:14.72]okay um where do I go I can go shrine petition alright how much favor do I have should I just get a dickload of boats yeah yeah give me a fucking ton of these and give me give me a fucking give me a hell I can't afford that
[54:44.84]I don't know what that is.
[54:45.46]Alright, now we got a shitload of ships.
[54:51.15]That's what I'm talking about.
[54:59.53]All ships.
[55:01.91]Follow me.
[55:02.39]We're going full speed ahead.
[55:10.37]There's so many ships here.
[55:13.95]Who is even fighting?
[55:18.13]Wait.
[55:19.39]Fleet, all ships, attack.
[55:22.83]What is that power orb?
[55:26.90]Oh, God.
[55:27.88]This is going to get real ugly.
[55:34.84]One of them is already sunk.
[55:35.82]Is that one of my ships that's already dead?
[55:42.35]I don't even...
[55:44.32]Listen, that's one of my ships.
[55:46.24]What are they doing?
[55:48.32]Are they being boarded?
[55:52.82]Look... There's a better way for you to do that.
[55:55.45]Just get on it.
[55:57.21]Like, fuck it.
[55:57.75]Come on.
[56:00.61]I got plenty of people here.
[56:02.59]Fleet.
[56:03.33]All ships.
[56:04.07]Attack.
[56:04.99]Get on here.
[56:06.37]We're gonna get it this time.
[56:12.45]Alright, the guys with the... Those guys have to die.
[56:14.75]These dudes with the hand cannons, gotta go.
[56:17.92]Oh my god, I'm at like 18 frames a second right now.
[56:23.12]This is bad.
[56:30.61]Well, he's... Something is smoking right now, and that's causing so many problems.
[56:38.21]Alright, we're doing fine.
[56:38.87]17, 24.
[56:43.05]Just watch out for the machine guns.
[56:44.31]Hold the shield up.
[56:45.03]Going down the stairs.
[56:45.71]Is strong attack even worth doing?
[56:52.84]I feel like it's not.
[56:58.56]I just clicked off the screen.
[57:01.07]My mouse made me alt-tab.
[57:08.88]More boats is more polygons.
[57:12.77]I guess, yeah, right?
[57:16.49]Why did I just fall down?
[57:22.77]Rest in peace, frames, I know.
[57:24.17]Honest to fucking god, I clicked off again.
[57:29.35]I gotta get that off the screen.
[57:31.24]It's causing too many problems.
[57:42.05]Take so long.
[57:43.73]Oh, I don't like want to do this.
[57:45.73]In fact, I'm not going to do this.
[57:48.34]I don't even care.
[57:49.28]Good luck.
[57:51.88]Wait, whose ship is this?
[57:57.26]Where's my boat?
[58:01.34]Isn't this my boat?
[58:05.33]What is this guy doing here?
[58:09.69]Is this not my ship?
[58:15.70]Change ship.
[58:21.28]I don't... Um... I guess I have to do this.
[58:36.09]These guys all have to die.
[58:38.01]We are seriously getting to the point of where this is like four frames a second for me.
[58:46.72]This is just turning into a slideshow.
[58:49.40]And it's getting worse and worse.
[58:50.64]And now I'm stuck over here.
[58:54.45]And I can't... Get out of the fucking way.
[59:04.09]How is there still 12 people alive?
[59:14.57]They're blocking me on both sides.
[59:21.65]It's so bad.
[59:24.99]This shit is seriously like fucking three frames a second.
[59:37.46]This frame rate is so bad I feel like I'm watching a claymation.
[59:41.41]This has just turned into a shitty claymation.
[59:50.83]There's only four of us left.
[59:53.37]Oh my god.
[59:57.54]I can't even tell what's happening.
[60:04.86]I'm gonna die again.
[60:05.72]And I didn't save it.
[60:07.30]Where's my...
[60:15.03]Get over here!
[60:25.25]Quickly!
[60:25.65]Quickly!
[60:25.99]Quickly!
[60:26.29]Quickly!
[60:26.57]Come here!
[60:26.83]Come here!
[60:27.03]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[60:45.76]If that wasn't, like, three and a half frames a second, that might have been okay.
[60:56.21]That frame rate was so bad, I just saw red images.
[60:58.73]Alright, we ain't doing that again.
[61:05.24]We're going to the shrine.
[61:06.32]That's fine.
[61:06.90]I ain't doing, like, 20 ships again.
[61:13.88]And we're getting like actual crewmen.
[61:16.58]Like this guy.
[61:17.58]And this guy.
[61:19.34]And one of these.
[61:20.26]And like one of those.
[61:21.14]And like two more of those guys.
[61:23.90]Alright.
[61:24.68]Now let's go fight the goddamn sea monster, please.
[61:39.55]I got the shitty ships again.
[61:40.65]Those ones are 300.
[61:45.76]Fleet.
[61:46.36]All ships, follow.
[61:47.62]Let's go.
[61:53.28]It's a calculated strategy.
[61:58.01]Yes, this is the game where I fought the gigantic fish and narwhals and stuff.
[62:02.21]Yep.
[62:03.99]We're avoiding this.
[62:05.93]I'm not fighting these things.
[62:07.33]We're just going... Like, that's one of my ships.
[62:15.13]I don't get that.
[62:16.91]How is that?
[62:18.83]Whatever.
[62:19.13]I'm not going to ask questions.
[62:20.11]We're going.
[62:24.15]This is not an ask questions stream at the moment.
[62:33.40]This is a just get me to where I want to go.
[62:43.17]Do I find this game fun?
[62:44.05]I actually do.
[62:48.31]I do find this game fun.
[62:52.37]It's fun to just kind of be an idiot and go around and plunder and stuff.
[63:01.35]The rest of my ships are in combat with something.
[63:03.29]Well... Fuck them.
[63:08.19]We can fight the monster by ourselves.
[63:15.13]I don't think you make ships in this game.
[63:16.75]I think you can buy them.
[63:18.21]There's a bunch of different ships for the different campaigns.
[63:25.43]All I care about is seeing one of the monsters.
[63:28.01]That's it.
[63:29.50]Don't care about much else.
[63:30.44]Where's the crew?
[63:32.16]They're all stuck back here.
[63:36.56]Just keep following me.
[63:41.98]Don't worry about anything else.
[63:43.46]Just follow me.
[63:46.41]+2 Imperial.
[63:47.80]Apparently they did okay.
[63:48.78]Alright.
[64:00.84]Getting closer.
[64:01.48]There's actually somebody already here.
[64:02.49]I'm gonna save it.
[64:11.03]That's fine the way it is.
[64:12.61]Okay.
[64:14.29]In combat with what?
[64:20.04]In combat with what?
[64:20.78]There's nothing here.
[64:31.12]Anybody see anything?
[64:31.95]There's no enemies or monsters or anything on the screen.
[64:35.33]What am I in combat with?
[64:38.57]Am I being pulled into combat because of my fucking idiot ship crew people?
[64:43.39]Is the fleet fighting?
[64:46.55]And is dragging me into combat?
[64:49.22]I feel like that's what's going on.
[64:59.55]Well, thanks a lot, guys.
[65:08.35]That's under attack?
[65:10.06]From me?
[65:19.96]I want to go times four.
[65:20.98]There's nothing here.
[65:28.10]Why does the floor of your ship look like flesh?
[65:31.88]Well, that's because.
[65:33.86]It's red velvet carpet.
[65:37.18]I had it installed yesterday.
[65:44.00]God, people really like.
[65:46.89]No, it says this thing is on top of me.

[66:20.85]How do I get off the boat?
[66:24.49]Like, can't I just get off?
[66:28.84]I'm trying to get off.
[66:30.42]I don't know how to let go of this.
[66:32.30]I have no idea.
[66:37.72]He doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[66:40.88]He's just flying around.
[66:41.84]I'm standing completely still.
[66:47.79]It's just somebody on a flight path.
[66:59.92]I can't shoot him.
[67:02.62]Is he just gonna be annoying?
[67:03.80]Oh, he's going that way now.
[67:15.51]What the fuck is going on?
[67:21.06]Why does he just fly around?
[67:22.28]Does he not do anything?
[67:27.56]Here comes one of my boats.
[67:34.89]Did somebody shoot it?
[67:41.07]Uh.
[67:43.05]Okay.
[67:43.55]Well, the griffon apparently doesn't do anything.
[67:50.12]Good thing we found the monster.
[67:51.40]He's going to follow us for the rest of the stream.
[67:53.72]Guarantee it.

[68:53.46]This thing's being hurt.
[68:56.88]I think he drove his head into the ground.
[69:02.35]Guys, I apologize for this.
[69:07.01]Yep.
[69:09.29]Guys, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 25 minutes, the stream's going to be really boring.
[69:15.65]Because this thing's going to kill itself.
[69:24.33]Yep.
[69:26.21]Uh, yeah.
[69:26.59]So we're gonna sit here, because, uh, holy mack, this is a, hey, this is a great, great editing point.
[69:31.30]How do I turn the HUD off?
[69:36.92]This thing's going to die.
[69:37.82]It's going to run itself into the ship over and over again and die.
[69:43.27]I'm gonna get a fucking front row seat for it.
[69:52.98]Just go find another monster.
[69:53.88]I can't.
[69:54.36]If I move, it might not happen.
[69:59.41]Moving is not what I want to do.
[70:02.61]Whoa!
[70:05.55]What the fuck was that?
[70:13.21]Oh, shit.
[70:13.73]It was that.
[70:14.13]Alright.
[70:15.55]We gotta move.
[70:18.94]What is- What's going on?
[70:20.82]What the fuck is- What is this lady?
[70:23.20]What is this- What is- What the fuck?
[70:26.60]What is happening?
[70:28.04]How do I get off- How do I get off the steering wheel?
[70:30.82]How do I get off the steering wheel?
[70:41.40]What is going on?
[70:42.80]How do I get off the steering wheel?
[70:45.60]I can't get off the steering wheel.
[70:48.87]She just fucking exploded on me.
[70:51.90]Was that a monster or was that a person?
[70:53.46]I have no fucking idea.
[70:56.14]I have absolutely... No, she's back.
[70:57.74]She's back.
[70:58.10]She's back, right?
[70:58.58]She teleported on top of me?
[71:01.89]Oh, God.
[71:03.11]I just gotta go this way.
[71:03.71]Go straight, straight, straight, straight, straight.
[71:06.81]I have, honest to God, have no clue what that was.
[71:09.65]But, like, Freya just teleported on the front of my bug.
[71:15.38]Ow.
[71:15.52]Ow.
[71:17.99]I just want to get to the sea monster.
[71:19.97]I just want to get to the sea monster.
[71:21.51]That's all I want to do.
[71:23.13]But I apparently am getting attacked by multiple things.
[71:29.07]Come on.
[71:29.75]Just get into the range of the sea monster.
[71:34.49]Do I have any crew?
[71:35.17]Okay, I have 25 crew.
[71:35.99]Okay, here we go.
[71:38.22]Here comes the monster.
[71:40.74]The griffon's still fucking here.
[71:43.76]Why are you still here, dude?
[71:45.76]Get out of here.
[71:49.02]Oh, oh my god.
[71:50.98]There's a new monster.
[71:51.64]New monster.
[71:53.30]That's new.
[71:53.98]That's fucking terrifying.
[71:55.12]That's fucking terrifying.
[71:58.54]Oh god.
[72:00.33]Oh god.
[72:01.37]He's not really doing much though.
[72:02.55]He's kind of just like taking a bath.
[72:09.03]What the fuck?
[72:12.65]Oh my god.
[72:14.13]Oh my god.
[72:15.45]Oh!
[72:18.75]How do I fight this as an orc?
[72:22.62]Is he gonna put his face over here?
[72:28.28]I can't do anything.
[72:30.92]I gotta go down.
[72:32.12]Go down.
[72:34.42]I gotta go down, I gotta hit him right in the face, just like Moby Dick.
[72:36.14]Didn't Moby Dick throw a spear in somebody's face?
[72:38.07]Where am I?
[72:40.61]What happened?
[72:41.51]Who is... Why am I doing this?
[72:44.21]Oh fuck, never mind.
[72:45.11]I'm getting out of here.
[72:49.75]We gotta bring the sea dragon back here.
[72:54.52]I don't have any ranged weapons.
[72:56.82]How do I fight a sea dragon?
[72:59.58]Why is this... Oh god.
[73:01.92]Oh god, hold on.
[73:04.56]This is where it gets real interesting.
[73:13.67]Okay, never mind.
[73:14.49]Never mind.
[73:16.93]That wasn't that interesting.
[73:19.05]That wasn't that interesting.
[73:21.71]Hey, remember this guy?
[73:23.81]Huh?
[73:26.43]All I'm waiting for is Freya to teleport on top of me.
[73:31.42]That would make me laugh.
[73:32.94]See, what is this?
[73:33.82]You see this?
[73:35.32]The purple thing that's hanging out right here.
[73:36.74]I feel like... Is that Freya?
[73:39.46]Freya?
[73:41.41]I think those are Freya's hands.
[73:46.16]What is it though?
[73:46.70]What the fuck is it?
[73:47.42]Why is there a hand there?
[73:50.80]Is it gonna grab me?
[73:53.54]No, this is a spooky hand that's floating around.
[73:55.80]Alright, watch out for the spooky hand.
[73:57.18]Alright, well, sure.
[74:06.74]Eventually, this thing, I mean, I'll just shoot it, I guess.
[74:11.93]Where's its health?
[74:16.74]I love... Okay, I need my... I need my fleet.
[74:18.88]All ships.
[74:20.64]Attack.
[74:22.22]Attack right here.
[74:23.48]Like, just attack this.
[74:25.94]Go.
[74:26.32]Like, I can't even do it.
[74:27.44]Does everybody get here?
[74:29.02]All ships.
[74:31.06]Come to me.
[74:31.68]Like, come to... That... Cheeky motherfucker just flew in front of me.
[74:38.19]Alright, here we go.
[74:42.64]I can't fight this.
[74:47.28]There's no fighting this thing as an orc.
[74:50.22]I guess I can just, like, slash his face.
[74:54.67]When he bites the boat?
[74:55.63]Dude, this is just a shitty Universal Studios ride.
[75:01.13]Why am I getting back on the boat?
[75:02.51]I didn't want to do... I didn't do that.
[75:11.64]Who is this?
[75:14.60]Oh my god, please.
[75:20.73]You annoying little shit.
[75:26.99]Well, yeah, it looks like a Mario 64 monster.
[75:32.03]The sea monsters are the fun parts.
[75:33.45]This is like, you guys aren't having any fun watching the sea monster?
[75:38.64]Alright, well... Hopefully... There he is.
[75:47.67]I missed.
[75:48.61]It's okay.
[75:49.45]I'm just gonna burn this motherfucker.
[75:50.85]Alright, well we're just going full speed ahead, right into his mouth.
[75:59.80]And... I just punched him in the face.
[76:03.76]Good.
[76:04.20]It worked.
[76:04.40]I wonder how many more times I have to do that.
[76:09.25]What's with the green fucking poison gas?
[76:15.97]I fucking love this game, seriously.
[76:18.63]Why is nobody else on my crew doing anything?
[76:24.50]Nobody's doing a damn thing.
[76:28.96]Burning a dragon.
[76:29.90]Yeah, well, I mean, give me a break.
[76:35.00]It's so loud, dude.
[76:39.00]Okay, here we go.
[76:42.26]Distract him.
[76:55.31]That's like how much damage he's taken, but I don't know if there's a way.
[76:59.67]I would love to just get off this and use a gun.
[77:02.73]Honest to God.
[77:08.17]The one thing that bothers me about this is I'm supposed to have a whole fleet.
[77:12.50]And I can't shoot this thing to save my life.
[77:15.42]What do you think?
[77:15.98]Fuck it.
[77:16.28]We're staying right here.
[77:17.40]Shooting him right in his ass.
[77:19.94]Just stay there and look pretty for me.
[77:22.40]Look handsome for me.
[77:24.56]Yeah.
[77:25.64]Good job.
[77:27.04]I really hope you stay right there.
[77:30.16]Just keep looking in the camera.
[77:31.26]Just give me like your most handsome face.
[77:34.61]There you go.
[77:35.17]Alright, I found his weakness.
[77:38.49]The Sea Dragon's weakness is don't even go near him.
[77:41.05]Just hold your camera in his face.
[77:45.99]Somebody just shot him.
[77:48.86]Is he dead?
[77:52.12]Uh... What is he doing?
[77:56.64]Dude, the ghost... The ghost hand just shot him.
[77:59.08]And he's pissed at it.
[78:01.18]He's angry at the Ghost Hand.
[78:03.82]Who's the fucking Ghost Hand?
[78:06.92]Okay.
[78:07.82]We're in a standoff right now.
[78:09.18]It's Sea Dragon versus Ghost Hand.
[78:15.27]Should I get close?
[78:16.41]I'm not sure what I should do here.
[78:23.91]I just got kill- I got- I got kill stolen from the Ghost Hand.
[78:33.05]Is he dead?
[78:35.27]Nope.
[78:36.45]He's not dead.
[78:40.89]He'll die right now.
[78:41.65]Like... Seriously?
[78:44.49]He's ragging.
[78:50.13]Alright.
[78:55.52]Can somebody please tell me what the fuck is going on with this?
[79:08.54]Why are they doing this?
[79:10.49]Why are they doing this?
[79:12.49]Now we're gonna go this corner.
[79:13.97]Oh yeah, we're gonna move our legs really quickly.
[79:16.09]Fast, fast, fast, really fast.
[79:20.95]What is spraying at me?
[79:23.57]This is crazy, seriously, it needs to be fucked up.
[79:30.59]Why are we going through space?
[79:32.75]We're going through hyper jump right now.
[79:34.21]Oh, he's the fucking dog, guys.
[79:40.38]I have no idea what's happening.
[79:47.78]The ghost hand is causing problems.
[79:49.06]Alright, let's burn the ghost hand and see what that does.
[79:59.32]Ghost Hand doesn't seem to want to do anything.
[80:01.10]Alright, well that... Let's go try one more monster.
[80:03.64]See where it is.
[80:04.10]It's right there.
[80:07.77]Let's go find... See if we can get a new monster.
[80:09.47]That... Okay, Sea Dragon... Was a solid, uh... A solid, like, 4 out of 10.
[80:14.11]As a new monster.
[80:16.05]I still enjoyed it.
[80:17.27]Fucking game... Game is awesome.
[80:19.83]What the... Is this the Ghost Hand?
[80:25.36]Alright, I'm gonna be real with you.
[80:26.46]If you, like, if you, like, think this game sucks, like, no, it don't.
[80:31.38]Like, this game is so charmingly stupid that, like, like, for instance, I told you he was gonna be here the whole time.
[80:39.18]You thought I was lying to you?
[80:41.46]It's currently snowing on my screen.
[80:44.12]There is a griffin that's forever chasing me.
[80:48.50]And for some reason we're being followed by a ghost hand.
[80:52.46]That at one point was Freya.
[80:54.72]How could you hate that game?
[80:57.38]You tell me how you don't like that game.
[80:59.52]You know what I mean?
[81:02.38]Alright, we're out of combat.
[81:05.56]We can make our way over here.
[81:10.50]What are these three doing?
[81:13.30]The griffin.
[81:13.72]Wait, the griffin's leaving us.
[81:16.65]What is the griffin doing over here?
[81:20.11]We're under attack.
[81:23.79]Oh, guys.
[81:25.07]Guys.
[81:26.88]I think there's two griffins after us.
[81:31.36]Don't fucking tell me that there's two griffins.
[81:35.88]There's one there.
[81:37.28]And there's one en route right now.
[81:39.98]Yeah, there's two now.
[81:41.74]This is fantastic.
[81:42.68]I love this.
[81:49.27]Wait, somebody died.
[81:53.43]Wait, how did he die?
[81:56.15]What is fighting on my boat?
[81:59.79]It is exploding.
[82:02.26]It's exploding.
[82:05.04]And how did he die?
[82:06.16]Alright, Sigmund just like tripped down the stairs and fucking made a bunch of noise and died.
[82:10.90]Ugh.
[82:15.73]More people are dying.
[82:21.68]No, stop.
[82:28.00]We've reached our destination.
[82:29.92]Why do I keep doing this for them?
[82:37.56]Oh no.
[82:38.70]I think I fucking broke the game.
[82:41.50]What is this?
[82:42.02]Oh wow, this is cool.
[82:46.16]This is fucking cool.
[82:52.21]What is on Skull Island?
[82:58.01]I'm just crashing right in the fucking Skull Island.
[83:05.77]I didn't do anything.
[83:06.55]Okay.
[83:08.39]This is the fucking best.
[83:09.29]This really is.
[83:11.57]I just really don't know what's attacking us.
[83:14.15]It doesn't make any sense.
[83:19.19]It's the fucking griffin.
[83:20.22]Of course it is.
[83:22.20]How much health is this stupid fucking full health?
[83:25.66]I want to get off.
[83:27.42]Yeah.
[83:29.06]How did I just do that?
[83:30.28]There we go.
[83:30.80]Okay.
[83:31.16]You know what?
[83:31.72]Fucking griffin.
[83:34.05]I ain't fucking around anymore.
[83:36.13]We're going to kill this motherfucker right now.
[83:38.29]Come on down here.
[83:40.39]Show your face.
[83:40.95]I dare you.
[83:42.09]He's just picking off everybody in my crew.
[83:45.54]And look what they're doing.
[83:48.48]Guys, this is not how you fight it, Griffin.
[83:53.30]I don't know what the fuck they're doing.
[83:56.32]They're trying to, like, take the position.
[84:00.80]They're trying to get in a position to fight the griffin.
[84:03.92]But they don't understand the griffins can be in the air.
[84:09.33]There's another griffin over there.
[84:10.53]I'm just going to swing wildly.
[84:17.99]Eventually I'll hit it, right?
[84:18.83]I got him.
[84:23.23]Yeah, I did.
[84:23.49]I hit him.
[84:31.60]Just get me back on here.
[84:32.50]There's no way I'm going to fight this.
[84:36.28]We just have to make it to right here.
[84:37.20]That's all I care about.
[84:39.25]Fuck the griffon.
[84:40.59]Fuck the ghost hand.
[84:43.31]There's no fight in this right now.
[84:50.55]Never trusted griffon.
[84:53.38]Throw a Diablo at it.
[84:54.34]I wish I could.
[84:56.04]I would whip Diablo at this motherfucker right now.
[84:58.28]Alright.
[84:58.96]Am I moving?
[85:01.02]Did the griffon, like, fuck up my boat?
[85:07.67]Why am I... Go forward.
[85:09.17]I am going forward.
[85:09.83]Okay.
[85:17.01]What is that?
[85:23.65]Oh, I don't even know how it goes.
[85:26.89]Half my crew is dying, that's more important.
[85:30.95]They're one unit now.
[85:38.92]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[85:40.30]I don't know what the fuck to say!
[85:44.72]One by one!
[85:47.74]What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?
[85:51.29]And now he's gonna come for me!
[85:53.34]Yeah!
[85:54.34]He is!
[85:54.78]I have to make it here until I die.
[85:58.17]I can't fight him.
[86:02.71]All I can do is just get bit by this bird.
[86:04.89]Because he's done eating all my crew.
[86:24.84]Shit That fuck is stupid that stupid horn sound is like pushing me fucking it I
[86:48.62]That was perfect timing for that.
[86:54.22]What the fuck?
[86:56.52]I'm sorry.
[86:57.88]Oh my god, that was perfect.
[86:59.42]You're red.
[87:00.56]Oh, except I'm fucking cracking up.
[87:06.42]Alright.
[87:09.04]Look.
[87:10.42]I don't know how to deal with griffins.
[87:12.82]So we have to get...
[87:15.55]This was the sea dragon, right?
[87:16.93]Or was it?
[87:17.51]No, I'm not even... Ah, fucking... We just have to drive straight.
[87:21.85]Just drive straight.
[87:23.33]For the love of fucking God.
[87:24.73]The horn sounds as me, guys.
[87:29.85]Yeah, she's like blowing a party horn over here.
[87:38.50]Call Jeremy, he's crying.
[87:40.76]I am.
[87:42.04]That was fucking hilarious.
[87:44.34]A bird bit my boat and exploded, and then a party horn happened.
[87:49.08]Okay.
[87:49.97]I don't... Just fuck the griffon.
[87:52.17]Please, just go this way.
[87:54.11]Where's my thing?
[87:54.77]Right here?
[87:55.09]I just wanna... I just... There's no way this is gonna happen.
[88:03.07]Yeah, my whole crew is gonna fucking die.
[88:06.66]And then, like, this is it, you know?
[88:12.32]Oh my god, what do I do here?
[88:13.30]I don't know what to even do.
[88:14.42]I have no way to fight it.
[88:19.64]Hire gun guys?
[88:20.74]You got it.
[88:21.38]Okay, I'm doing that.
[88:23.00]Crew.
[88:24.85]Uh... Can I... No, I only have these things.
[88:32.35]Um... Shrine.
[88:33.69]Can I buy it from the petition?
[88:36.39]Cultist.
[88:38.66]Cultist, uh...
[88:41.66]Is it an icon of power?
[88:45.45]Elite Chaos War.
[88:46.31]I don't have enough to do any of this shit.
[88:49.55]Will the icon shoot it?
[88:56.32]Buy the helicopter.
[88:57.14]I don't have enough for that.
[88:58.52]I wonder if... Will this shoot laser beams?
[89:02.82]Or will the cultist shoot?
[89:03.78]I just don't know.
[89:06.67]I don't know.
[89:10.97]No ranged weapons.
[89:11.75]I'm going to hire a... I'm going to get one of these just because I don't know what it does.
[89:18.46]And I feel like... Look at this guy's fucking face.
[89:23.12]Does that guy have a gun?
[89:26.96]Something is happening.
[89:29.12]In the background on my ship right now.
[89:31.34]Something really loud.
[89:36.94]What is going on?
[89:38.56]And why is it so loud?
[89:45.98]It is shooting.
[89:48.18]Nice.
[89:50.53]This is perfect.
[89:57.31]Right?
[89:57.43]Is this thing doing anything besides making an annoying noise?
[90:06.66]It's shooting my own ship.
[90:07.74]It's shooting me.
[90:10.32]God, are you fucking kidding me?
[90:14.26]There's a fucking swarm of birds.
[90:17.02]There's just fucking birds everywhere.
[90:20.78]It's just a- I'm dead.
[90:23.90]Again.
[90:24.52]This is it.
[90:27.38]My fate has been sealed.
[90:31.33]My fucking fate has been sealed.
[90:34.09]Yes!
[90:34.97]Why did- Where did they come- There's a guy running around with an axe.
[90:53.87]gonna go we're gonna go a different way we're gonna go so um we're gonna go this way because apparently I can't go that way so we're gonna we're gonna turn the boat around real nice and slow like you know we're gonna buy like two of those things
[91:14.49]And hopefully not run into any more.
[91:15.77]I can't even buy more than one, right?
[91:18.53]Well, whatever.
[91:18.99]Just have a bunch of dickheads.
[91:21.79]This thing is so loud.
[91:22.67]I'm so sorry how loud this is, but, you know, sometimes you gotta make do and try to get rid of the griffin.
[91:28.09]It's just missing.
[91:33.12]What a piece of shit.
[91:34.06]Can it even hit it?
[91:36.60]I don't think it can.
[91:42.68]Hey, do you guys like the sound of getting your teeth filled until the stream ends?
[91:48.28]Because that's what's going to happen.
[91:52.39]Jesus fucking God.
[91:56.67]I don't think anybody can hear me.
[91:57.49]Can you guys even hear me over this noise?
[91:58.89]Should I just break this thing?
[92:01.76]Alright, we're almost there.
[92:05.54]We can see whatever this is.
[92:09.22]I'm actually going to shit my pants.
[92:11.96]Alright, here we go.
[92:17.13]I'm gonna turn the volume down.
[92:21.19]Sound effects?
[92:21.95]Put the sound effects down to like 15%.
[92:23.73]Hey, that barely helped.
[92:28.90]Alright.
[92:32.64]Mute yourself so we can hear the noise more.
[92:39.98]How close?
[92:41.24]Alright.
[92:42.42]This is for all- Alright, good, I can do x4 speed, thank god.
[92:45.94]We're outrunning the griffin.
[92:52.31]The range on this thing is fucking remarkable.
[92:57.53]Almost there.
[92:59.61]Alright, you guys ready for the other monster?
[93:01.13]Hopefully it's not an arwal.
[93:07.66]That thing is just annoying at this point.
[93:10.44]I hope it gets fucking destroyed.
[93:11.48]Alright, here we go.
[93:13.45]Ladies and gentlemen, the next monster.
[93:16.29]The other monster that we have potentially not seen yet is... Oh, I just saw lightning.
[93:25.76]Just saw a lightning strike.
[93:29.92]Hmm, gotta find him.
[93:38.11]Whatever it is, it's right here.
[93:40.57]Hold on.
[93:41.71]Ship.
[93:43.23]We're under attack.
[93:46.72]No, we're not.
[93:49.16]Oh, now we are.
[93:49.76]Okay, what is it?
[93:51.82]Something new.
[93:53.52]Something new and something exciting.
[93:57.95]Something new and exciting?
[94:00.43]I think so.
[94:16.06]HB, I'm back!
[94:18.81]Remember me?
[94:48.72]Okay, bye.
[94:49.16]It was fun to see you again.
[94:52.87]But, uh, bye.
[94:53.71]I ain't doing that shit again.
[94:57.39]He's chasing me.
[95:04.71]No, he's just waddling away.
[95:09.79]He really is just, like, waving to me.
[95:13.83]The music makes this so much better.
[95:16.61]Get the fuck out of the way.
[95:17.91]He's going to kill him.
[95:19.00]No, don't go kill him.
[95:19.88]He's too majestic.
[95:20.68]I honestly really wish he would just get out of the way.
[95:24.72]Alright, come on.
[95:25.34]Give me like a close monster.
[95:30.90]Fucking hell, man.
[95:31.82]How am I supposed to get by that?
[95:33.24]How am I supposed to go that way?
[95:38.79]Maybe, you know, I'm going to cut around the corner here instead of going straight through.
[95:48.99]There's the griffin again.
[95:55.86]Turn it off.
[95:57.48]Turn the shit off.
[95:59.78]I'm sick of hearing it.
[96:00.48]I don't want to hear this anymore.
[96:06.62]I don't want to hear it anymore.
[96:09.78]Get out of here.
[96:12.30]Wait a minute.
[96:13.81]Wait a minute.
[96:14.93]Wait.
[96:16.37]How did I take this?
[96:19.67]Oh, fucking no way.
[96:22.59]No way.
[96:23.99]Griffin, come back.
[96:27.67]I love how the Griffin now doesn't want anything to do with me.
[96:37.95]He's gone.
[96:42.37]He's gone.
[96:44.98]Griffin is gone.
[96:49.23]Okay.
[96:49.79]So... There's that.
[96:52.63]You know.
[96:53.37]There's that.
[96:58.74]Dude doesn't leave me alone the entire game.
[97:00.74]And I take control of the orb and he's all of a sudden just like, I don't feel like playing anymore.
[97:03.76]I'm gonna go home.
[97:07.96]Alright.
[97:08.99]Let's do it.
[97:15.12]Hopefully we can make it all the way across.
[97:16.82]We got a straight shot here, so... I'm hoping we don't run into any bullshit on the way.
[97:22.44]Save it.
[97:22.80]Good call.
[97:24.31]Good call.
[97:29.13]I'm so glad I came back to this game.
[97:30.61]This game is fucking amazing.
[97:34.19]In every single stretch of the word.
[97:39.54]Why does it make that sound when idling?
[97:41.84]Because...
[97:44.21]For some reason, the developers were in shop class and heard the giant circular saw that was sitting in the middle of the room that every time it was turned on gave you a headache because it was so loud and horrible.
[97:55.98]And they decided to put that in the game and have it be constant.
[97:58.78]I didn't really answer your question.
[98:00.40]I just kind of said that.
[98:01.64]But, you know.
[98:05.21]It is what it is.
[98:08.12]Is this game online?
[98:09.12]It is currently not online.
[98:10.58]It is an alpha.
[98:12.62]It is 0.8.
[98:14.18]I feel like they've got a couple more major content updates to do before it's, I'd say, worthy of a purchase.
[98:20.55]But, if you're a fan of just derpy, fun, kind of charmingly bad games, and I'm going to say charmingly bad in the sense that you can obviously tell that this game is... Like, somebody's having a lot of fun making this game, right?
[98:38.98]Somebody's having a ton of fun making this, regardless if it might be not very many people.
[98:45.64]I think they're doing a great job making this charmingly fun, hilarious, awesome game.
[98:50.02]I love this game.
[98:54.30]From the three times I've played this game, and maybe eight hours or so I've had, like seven hours in the game so far, I'm still here, right?
[99:04.49]I'm still playing it.
[99:07.13]If you're a fan of shitty pirate games with babies in Diablo suits, then yes, absolutely.
[99:11.41]This is the one you want to use.
[99:13.10]This is the game you want to play.
[99:14.04]Okay, we're almost there.
[99:16.00]In fact, I'm going to cut it.
[99:17.46]Because I don't want to go in that circle.
[99:18.92]Fuck that.
[99:23.73]Now, who knows?
[99:24.15]In, like, another... In, like, another couple updates?
[99:28.01]Once they get to an actual, like, beta?
[99:30.33]Or into, like, an actual release?
[99:33.41]Might be really fucking great.
[99:36.93]I don't think it'll ever lose its charm, though.
[99:39.03]So, for sure.
[99:41.07]I'm glad I decided to play this.
[99:44.97]Can you buy weapons for your crew?
[99:46.07]I'm sure you can, but I haven't really looked into it that much.
[99:52.52]Alright, we're getting close.
[99:56.16]Have I ever considered a Raven's Cry stream?
[100:00.68]No, because...
[100:03.37]Everything that I thought was funny in that game, then the two videos I made, I feel like that's it.
[100:08.01]That's, like, pretty much all I could say.
[100:10.96]And I would just kind of be redoing the same stuff that was in the video for, like, if I streamed it.
[100:19.01]Oh, this game is not perfect by any means.
[100:20.29]You guys have watched it.
[100:22.13]Something that doesn't need to be perfect to be able to be fun.
[100:25.79]It's different.
[100:26.77]Games like this don't exist.
[100:27.95]People don't make these games.
[100:30.06]These games are very hard to come by.
[100:31.88]Stuff like this.
[100:32.66]Alright.
[100:35.74]We are in the territory of the monster.
[100:41.78]We got our cricket machine next to us.
[100:48.73]And, alright.
[100:49.89]It's time for the search.
[100:52.85]My ship is doing alright.
[100:56.71]Okay.
[100:57.49]Here we go.
[100:58.15]I can hear that the music's coming.
[100:59.53]That's how you know that a monster's on the way.
[101:03.16]If it's a narwhal, the stream ends.
[101:07.86]You heard it.
[101:08.20]If it's a narwhal, the stream's turning off.
[101:10.86]It was nice.
[101:11.22]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[101:12.99]If this shit's a narwhal, goodbye.
[101:16.60]You guys all rock.
[101:18.02]I'm anticipating a narwhal.
[101:27.33]It's actually a narwhal.
[101:29.73]It's actually a fucking narwhal.
[101:39.74]Well, thanks everybody for watching the stream.
[101:43.59]Thank you so much.
[101:46.55]It's actually a narwhal.
[101:49.72]It's over.
[101:51.18]Stream's over.
[101:54.78]I have to... I have to at least fight him.
[101:58.48]Right?
[101:59.78]I can't just go out like this.
[102:01.04]I gotta at least try to fight him.
[102:03.90]Calling all ships.
[102:06.69]Calling all ships.
[102:09.05]I'm just gonna wait till they all get here.
[102:10.15]This is gonna be a shit show.
[102:12.98]All ships, sail to position.
[102:15.12]Sail to right here.
[102:15.96]This is going to be a total... Oh, boy.
[102:19.76]I hope my ship stays around for now.
[102:24.60]But everyone sail to this location.
[102:26.54]And let's just have a shit show by the end of the stream.
[102:28.30]Why not?
[102:28.60]Just got to wait for my friends.
[102:33.06]Hopefully he doesn't destroy the ship by then.
[102:34.64]This guy's having trouble standing.
[102:46.74]You gonna be alright, man?
[102:47.66]You, like, seasick?
[102:51.84]This guy is just seasick.
[102:59.88]You guys need to be careful.
[103:00.78]There's a Gnar wall around.
[103:03.16]If these don't... Can these guys just walk off?
[103:12.99]I think they can, actually.
[103:14.09]Hold on.
[103:19.06]Why are you coming over here with this narwhal over here?
[103:22.66]Why don't you do anything?
[103:25.80]Pick up a sword.
[103:28.08]Raise your arms, man.
[103:30.44]At least baby Diablo decided to have claws.
[103:35.89]Oh, for the love of God.
[103:36.81]Alright, well, here comes the whole crew.
[103:41.03]I love how I can do this, but they can't.
[103:46.91]He's not going to go in the water.
[103:48.01]Well, whatever.
[103:48.47]Here comes the first boat.
[103:55.97]Look at how epic this music is.
[103:57.41]Or how fucking dumb this scene that you're seeing right now on the screen is.
[104:01.33]He's still chasing us.
[104:14.44]What happens when he gets... Let me... Alright, hold on.
[104:17.78]Get back on the ship.
[104:21.02]Okay, here's where we're going to have a little bit of fun.
[104:24.10]Who is this dickhead currently?
[104:27.62]No, he just went through.
[104:28.34]He doesn't want anything to do with those people.
[104:31.01]I don't want to even fight the narwhal.
[104:33.25]His dream's over.
[104:37.87]Just stay right here.
[104:38.67]Who cares?
[104:41.69]Can somebody at least help me fight?
[104:44.99]Please.
[104:46.45]That's all I care about.
[104:47.49]Fleet.
[104:48.57]All ships.
[104:50.19]Just defend me.
[104:54.01]Defend.
[104:55.27]Defend me.
[105:03.71]There he goes.
[105:04.21]Now he's fighting the other... Nice trick.
[105:13.03]Why does he always just want to fight me?
[105:15.55]I never understand this.
[105:18.07]He's supposed to come stick his face.
[105:22.24]You know, actually, I got an idea.
[105:23.40]Okay, do that again, Narwhal.
[105:26.90]I will pinch your horn and just rip it off.
[105:30.52]Did he use the orb?
[105:31.24]Yeah, but that's going to be loud.
[105:32.84]I want to pinch his face.
[105:34.76]We're going for the face pinch.
[105:35.68]Here we go, guys.
[105:39.21]You want to do a narwhal versus narwhal?
[105:40.89]I got this shit too, buddy.
[105:42.31]Here we go.
[105:57.26]Thank you for watching.
[105:59.28]It was a very fun day.
[106:01.58]It was a very fun stream there.
[106:04.90]Much appreciated, everybody, for sticking around that whole time.
[106:08.22]Played a couple of pirate games.
[106:09.50]But... You know, it was... Good fun.
[106:14.25]Good fun.
[106:18.13]How the fuck was I supposed to... Like, what... Why?
[106:22.37]I got out-Narwald.
[106:25.77]Alright.
[106:27.06]Anyways.
[106:29.68]That was... That was a way... That was a way for it to end.
[106:33.60]So.
[106:35.70]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[106:37.85]That's gonna be it.
[106:40.01]Tomorrow night, I'm hoping that I can get in touch with Etalyx again.
[106:44.89]Maybe we can redo what we were gonna do tonight.
[106:48.63]Yeah.
[106:49.83]Sorry for killing you.
[106:53.08]Yeah.
[106:53.98]So, that was fun.
[106:54.90]I had a great time.
[106:55.62]That game is very fun to play.
[106:58.24]And tomorrow night, hopefully me and Etalyx can get some shit going with some co-op stuff.
[107:04.23]Friday night.
[107:04.81]It'll be fun.
[107:06.85]But, yeah.
[107:07.53]Take care, guys.
[107:08.87]I'll see you all soon.
[107:10.05]And have a good rest of your evening.
[107:11.55]Bye.
[107:12.85]Goodbye.
[107:38.24]Good night.
[107:39.90]Good night, everybody.
[107:40.59]Good night.
