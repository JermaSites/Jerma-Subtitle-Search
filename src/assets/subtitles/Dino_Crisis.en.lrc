[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.61]Come on.
[00:01.15]Come on.
[00:03.37]Tell me.
[00:04.07]Tell me it's true.
[00:06.42]Tell me it's true.
[00:07.30]Oh, yep.
[00:08.84]We got ourselves a little scenario here.
[00:15.44]I knew it.
[00:16.12]I fucking knew I hit it here.
[00:17.76]So, here we go.
[00:18.88]As you can see, this is... Let me show it to you.
[00:21.38]Show the camera so the camera can see it.
[00:23.70]This is Adam Sandler is the cobbler.
[00:27.50]Right?
[00:29.57]mystery fucking prize in here.
[00:31.91]What's in here?
[00:32.69]We got Adam Sandler's The Cobbler.
[00:36.29]And then what?
[00:39.24]Die Hard Trilogy.
[00:42.76]And then what?
[00:44.66]Dino Crisis!
[00:49.50]Oh!
[00:56.99]Don't throw these things around.
[01:11.53]Of course it would be like that.
[01:14.85]Just having a little fun.
[01:20.11]So you're the guy that puts the wrong thing in the wrong... Oh yeah, I did that everywhere.
[01:24.24]It'd be funny if I put like fucking ten discs in there.
[01:37.95]Level of organizing.
[01:40.07]Dino Crisis.
[01:42.36]Are you ready?
[01:45.08]I told you I was going to turn it on.
[01:46.26]That does not mean it's going to... A new generation of dinosaurs.
[01:50.13]Let's see what the screen's changing to.
[01:52.79]Dino Crisis.
[01:56.97]There's three Dino Crises?
[01:58.97]No, there's not, is there?
[02:05.46]There's three Dino Crises.
[02:09.04]Strange.
[02:16.80]Do they say it?
[02:18.54]Dino Crisis.
[02:20.68]They don't, do they?
[02:24.96]I hope they do.
[02:25.46]Here we go.
[02:42.80]A dinosaur just said it in dinosaur language.
[02:49.64]Dino Crisis!
[02:51.10]I have successfully infiltrated under the guise of a researcher as planned.
[03:00.69]I have encountered no information regarding top secret development of new type weapons.
[03:08.46]but I have discovered there is an unexpected individual at this facility.
[03:13.12]The man is Dr. Kirk, the leading authority of our nation's energy research.
[03:18.30]Dr. Kirk was alleged to have died in an accident during the course of an experiment three years ago.
[03:23.66]Reports were premature and it appears that he is currently working as the head of a non-weapon project at this facility.
[03:31.05]The experiment is in the late stages of development.
[03:34.61]Regarding the staged accidental death, it appears that this country is somehow involved.
[03:38.79]Yeah.
[03:39.79]Recommending that necessary actions be taken immediately.
[03:42.31]I wasn't listening at all.
[03:44.45]I just hit the start button.
[03:45.23]Does that make me a bad person?
[03:48.18]Probably.
[03:58.06]By the way, this game is a classic game, but I'm absolutely not gonna play this for probably more than 20 minutes.
[04:11.36]I have to go get ready for PAX soon here.
[04:14.47]Whoops.
[04:15.79]Not a big deal.
[04:16.81]Mhm.
[04:40.04]I'm sure they're not out here, too.
[04:41.83]It's dark here as well.
[04:45.65]Stay here, Junior.
[04:46.15]Leave the guards to me.
[04:47.07]Stay here, Junior.
[05:09.43]Hey, did you hear what he just called me?
[05:12.05]Forget about it.
[05:13.09]Just let Gale handle this.
[05:17.31]Oh, my dino meter is flickering.
[05:19.14]Alright, here we go.
[05:26.92]Backyard of the facility.
[05:28.40]Are the guards dinosaurs?
[05:34.20]I'll infiltrate the facility and occupy the control room on the first floor.
[05:39.54]I should have access to all the security systems from there.
[05:43.60]I'll contact you as soon as I've cleared the room.
[05:46.06]Okay.
[05:52.24]So what's the story here?
[05:53.06]Do I just have to sit around?
[05:57.24]Just stand around?
[06:07.88]Okay, I walked forward.
[06:10.57]Let me guess.
[06:11.89]This is some of your handiwork, right?
[06:14.85]Hmm.
[06:15.87]The brass is still warm.
[06:19.31]These guards were shooting at something very recently.
[06:22.67]Maybe you shouldn't have skipped the cutscene.
[06:23.78]So who were they fighting?
[06:25.40]This wasn't much of a fight.
[06:27.26]I don't think these guards hit anything before getting sliced and diced.
[06:31.26]Whatever they were shooting at came in through there, ripped right through the steel fence.
[06:36.34]Well, the hole is nice and clean.
[06:38.15]But I still say you could have done this.
[06:40.77]Very funny.
[06:42.75]Still need to figure out what happened here.
[06:45.03]Continue to sweep the area.
[06:46.05]Ray's arm, whole hand point, arm comes down to sides.
[06:52.79]This, I'll show you.
[06:54.14]In every fucking Resident Evil, every Capcom game that they came out with, they always do this thing.
[06:58.34]So they'll say a sentence, right, and they'll go, and that's why you need to listen to me.
[07:03.78]Let me tell you something.
[07:05.48]It makes you unstable.
[07:11.22]I love that so much.
[07:27.11]I'm just sliding around.
[07:29.65]It's so dark.
[07:30.53]I can't even turn the brightness up.
[07:31.73]Were these games this dark?
[07:33.45]I don't remember them being like this.
[07:39.50]He's checking the ground.
[07:47.69]What do we got in here?
[07:48.78]Popcorn?
[07:51.30]No.
[07:51.58]I'm going to get jump scared.
[07:57.52]The words backup generator area ground level are carved into it.
[08:00.89]You got the VG area key.
[08:05.01]This hurts my head.
[08:05.79]This looks like Stern in the 1994 website.
[08:07.75]Equip it, I guess.
[08:08.27]Ugh.
[08:19.38]Alright, so what, I'm gonna kill one dinosaur and then end the stream?
[08:21.64]Is that how this works?
[08:26.03]Shoot a dinosaur and then turn off the stream.
[08:34.18]I got a resurrection stone.
[08:42.80]So I probably will end up being live from PAX at some point.
[08:47.10]I know I'm not going to be at my desk at my computer, but... You can probably expect to see my face at some point over the weekend at PAX.
[08:59.40]Maybe there'll be some weird IRL stream.
[09:04.21]Maybe.
[09:04.97]It's possible.
[09:06.43]It's actually very possible, I would say, at this point.
[09:11.24]What do I do here?
[09:13.30]What am I supposed to do?
[09:24.48]Find Dino Crisis at Pact.
[09:31.18]I don't have the key?
[09:33.18]Didn't I just pick up a key?
[09:34.36]I guess not.
[09:41.18]No, it's right there, isn't it?
[09:46.82]BG area key.
[09:48.74]It cannot be used here.
[09:51.28]Okay, I guess not.
[09:52.38]Where's the other door I haven't been in?
[09:57.99]Uh, I haven't been in the door... Where the fuck have I not been?
[10:09.70]Back here?
[10:11.80]I guess.
[10:13.58]This is a clickbait title.
[10:15.20]Where the Raptor's at.
[10:16.26]Yeah, you know, this is true.
[10:17.38]I gotta, like, get through the first area first.
[10:24.12]Oh, yeah, I was getting a phone call.
[10:25.42]I forgot about the phone call.
[10:28.22]Progress?
[10:28.54]How dare you.
[10:28.94]Show your belly?
[10:30.48]Alright!
[10:42.54]Bellycam!
[10:43.34]Here it comes!
[10:43.98]Don't.
[10:45.04]I'm eating.
[10:45.54]Don't do that.
[11:13.79]Let's go outside.
[11:16.51]Follow me.
[11:21.77]It's too busy focusing on belly cam.
[11:26.15]This is the storage room.
[11:32.71]Can you tell I'm paying all kinds of attention right now?
[11:35.29]This is not good.
[11:44.92]Did he open it?
[11:46.40]Where did he go?
[11:53.16]I want your face.
[12:01.58]Is there anywhere else to go?
[12:02.48]It's literally zero attention.
[12:06.06]I'm, like, paying attention to you guys, not the video game.
[12:11.59]I may as well just be, like...
[12:13.97]streaming outside in my, like, you might as well just see a picture of the outside of my window or something.
[12:26.18]I made it in here.
[12:29.14]Also, I don't know why, I think it's the way the game is being captured.
[12:32.30]I can't, it's so dark, I can't even function.
[12:35.30]There's probably going to be a jump scare here, and I'm not even going to be able to see it.
[12:50.83]We just went in.
[12:53.21]That's disgusting.
[12:56.15]This guy's been eviscerated.
[12:58.07]Something tore his intestine straight out.
[12:59.95]Intestines?
[13:00.93]Why are they saying this so strangely?
[13:01.75]Look at those tooth marks.
[13:03.25]It had to be some sort of animal.
[13:04.89]Progress.
[13:05.86]Intestines.
[13:07.46]Okay, let's move on.
[13:12.04]Progress.
[13:14.90]That's with your intestines.
[13:19.61]I'll stand guard here.
[13:21.01]You go inside and take a look around.
[13:22.73]Okay.
[13:22.89]What's your thing, Dad?
[13:33.31]Watch out for the monster!
[13:35.25]Here comes the monster!
[13:36.90]Any second now.
[13:42.32]Need a battery.
[13:46.20]There are three buttons.
[13:47.62]Which will you press?
[13:55.10]Which button will you press?
[13:56.12]I'm supposed to be following a color scheme here and I'm not exactly sure what the scheme is.
[14:07.51]What's the color scheme?
[14:18.63]Is this going to be something on a wall?
[14:23.46]What is the thing that shows you the colors on the wall?
[14:30.34]Okay, red, blue, green, white.
[14:32.10]There it is.
[14:32.36]Red, blue, green, white.
[14:35.51]Red, blue, green, white.
[14:36.81]Red.
[14:37.05]No!
[14:58.63]Mm-hmm.
[14:59.41]Cancel.
[15:00.29]Hit the switch.
[15:05.65]Red.
[15:06.41]Blue.
[15:07.23]Green.
[15:08.65]White.
[15:14.59]Got it.
[15:15.55]I think that was a Velociraptor, right?
[15:19.58]There's got to be a monster here.
[15:28.37]he's gonna jump out now he's gonna be cut in half too we're gonna see his bones gail gail where are your bones here it comes here comes
[15:57.15]I can't even, you know the T-Rex scream?
[16:00.05]The velociraptor scream, it goes like, you like suck in air.
[16:07.10]Alright.
[16:11.07]First dino.
[16:27.14]Oh, am I playing?
[16:28.04]I thought that was still a cutscene.
[16:29.74]It's so dark, I thought that was part of the cutscene.
[16:43.38]Did somebody get the guy to get off the piano?
[16:57.07]you've been you've used the reviserating machine what the music is somebody just a cat jumping on somebody's computer a cat jumping on somebody's piano ready guys here comes the cat he's gonna jump up and he's gonna stomp all over the keys he's gonna ruin the song I can't skip this
[17:26.08]I can't see a fucking thing.
[17:31.55]I tell you, we're gonna kill one dinosaur and then... I'm probably gonna have to turn the screen off.
[17:35.79]How long have we had this room for?
[17:38.11]Like, four hours?
[17:38.77]Because we... I lost connection.
[17:42.68]It's like an hour or so, right?
[17:55.42]Done.
[18:01.93]He's done.
[18:02.49]I shot that dinosaur quite a few times.
[18:05.43]Wait, is this my friend?
[18:07.91]Is this boss?
[18:11.13]Boss!
[18:19.44]These games were so much fun, though.
[18:21.82]They were scary.
[18:32.57]Can I get in here?
[18:35.70]That's unfair.
[18:36.34]Let me take a look here.
[18:42.50]I got the control system back online.
[18:45.70]What's the situation over there?
[18:47.15]What's the situation?
[18:48.55]It's Gale.
[18:49.73]I lost him.
[18:52.41]So what's the bad news?
[18:54.15]Did you run into some guards?
[18:56.51]You're not going to believe this.
[18:57.95]He was attacked by some kind of dinosaur.
[19:02.40]Apparently he doesn't believe us.
[19:06.82]Big-ass lizard!
[19:07.56]Alright.
[19:07.74]Alright, guys.
[19:08.06]I think that's it for tonight.
[19:34.67]I'm disappointed that Monster Rancher 3 was not what we were looking for.
[19:38.49]Maybe we'll try again with 4.
[19:43.86]PAX is tomorrow.
[19:45.36]If you go into PAX, you'll see me there at some point.
[19:47.79]In the lobby.
[19:50.80]Yeah, I'm not doing like an official meetup any other day besides Saturday at 4.
[19:54.43]Remember, Saturday 4 p.m.
[19:56.33]in the lobby.
[19:56.87]You'll see a tweet.
[19:57.49]Follow Twitter.
[20:00.91]But if you're just like hit me up on Twitter, just like send me a tweet that you're around.
[20:08.30]And if I'm around, I'll try to see it and meet as many people as I can.
[20:15.47]Yeah, we're going for about four hours tonight.
[20:17.49]I wanted to go for longer.
[20:18.41]I wanted to go for like five plus.
[20:20.17]But that was also assuming that Monster Rancher 3 was going to be... You know, we were going to get attached to it and addicted to it.
[20:26.57]So... Yeah, if you weren't here earlier, I lost... My connection to Twitch died.
[20:35.85]After like an hour or so.
[20:37.07]Hour and a half of streaming or something.
[20:40.81]But, see you at PAX.
[20:43.49]If you're going...
[20:46.09]I'll be really easy.
[20:46.87]Here's the funny thing.
[20:47.51]I'll be really easy to find at PAX.
[20:50.44]Because I can't go down to the show floor.
[20:52.96]So, I'll be in one of the lobbies somewhere.
[20:57.64]Won't be that hard to find me.
[21:00.37]But, have a safe travel if you're coming to Boston.
[21:04.41]And IRL stream probably will happen.
[21:08.27]I just have to, like, buy some data.
[21:11.35]and try to figure out how to get that to work.
[21:12.83]So expect, at some point, maybe like Friday or Saturday, potentially, to see a terrible, bumbling, buffoon, technical mess IRL stream, maybe at some point at PAX.
[21:25.70]So... Have a good rest of your night, everybody.
[21:29.66]We're going to do the credits.
[21:30.90]Thank you for... I was going to say stepping on me.
[21:36.67]Thank you for stepping in and around.
[21:37.93]Thanks for stepping on me.
[21:41.58]But, yeah, we're going to do the credits.
[21:44.89]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[21:48.67]And here they come.
[21:51.85]All the resubs and all the new subs tonight.
[21:54.51]These are all of them.
[21:56.75]Much love to y'all.
[22:01.38]Thank you, TheRogster, KingSwaggaz, GrayZ124, FostyFP, DiamondRushLive,

[22:42.92]Speed it up?
[22:43.90]No, I need to get it right once in my, I gotta get it right once in my life, you know?
[22:49.22]We can't just have every one of these credits be like, it's funny for like the first few times, we gotta give it, where are we?
[22:53.44]Where are we?
[22:53.70]Bill364, Aldo the Great, D Flyers, Everson, Ruddable, Greasy Italian,
[23:10.00]Perry Trachet, Rexfire101 Grain Bender, Modus Pawns, Get in the Clown Car, Kiwicha, C3 Slip Ball, Baby Fist, DJ Candy, Kishuna, The Cosmonator, Snaldo, Milky McMilkerson, Ace J, Arco,
[23:38.79]Cyan, TF2.
[23:41.87]Bixtra, I can't fucking do it.
[23:45.53]Bixta.
[23:47.98]Kleenex, Kleinstriff.
[23:50.04]E-Strong, Bluestocking, Alphard, 21, Glorious.
[23:54.62]Ah, D-Roll with me, Findon, Luzlor.
[24:00.78]Glyphbin, MySonics, Myconics, AgentDrag, FunkyBurlin, Bird, Fluverous, and TrueBlue.
[24:13.30]Thank you, guys.
[24:15.76]Thank you for your support.
[24:17.34]Thank you for subscribing.
[24:18.34]I actually do better when it's faster.
[24:21.14]Don't ask me how.
[24:23.18]I never called out your sub, Jalazer.
[24:25.15]How is that possible?
[24:30.95]Twitch Prime subs aren't in the credits.
[24:32.61]They should be.
[24:35.29]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:36.67]This is what happened last time, too.
[24:38.75]So, the reason why that happened... If your name didn't come up tonight... That's because... The stream... After like an hour or so... What, like an hour and a half?
[24:49.06]The stream died.
[24:50.54]So, it's... When I press the start streaming button, it takes...
[24:55.06]Until the stream stops and starts again.
[24:58.38]So, all the people that subbed when the stream was going for an hour and then came down.
[25:02.86]So, sorry about that, guys.
[25:05.72]Because it is only... It only pulls the people that... For that period of being live.
[25:11.48]The people that subbed and resubbed, so... Sorry about that.
[25:15.23]I wish that would be... I wish that it would be just for the period that you... You know, for the day or something.
[25:21.15]But thank you all regardless.
[25:23.88]And let's get to the bits.
[25:25.53]Again, if you're just sticking around, or you just wanted to come and watch the stream tonight and you're leaving now, if you are going to PAX, keep in mind, there's not going to be any scheduled streams for the next two days.
[25:38.00]There's not going to be, oh, it's Thursday at 7, Friday at 7.
[25:40.48]I'm not going to be here.
[25:42.22]So just randomly until Tuesday of this coming week, expect like sporadic random, maybe like an IRL stream or something.
[25:51.50]But there is no scheduled anything while I'm doing PAX.
[25:56.20]so see you next week if you uh aren't going to be watching this weekend potentially and let's get to the bits so first and foremost let us get to I gotta go back a while ago uh give me one second

[27:46.26]Thank you for the $50, Tim.
[27:49.01]Hi, Jerma.
[27:49.31]Thanks for the entertainment over the years.
[27:50.45]Thanks for the variety of games you play and the joy you've brought me and everybody else.
[27:53.63]Have a good stream.
[27:55.89]Thank you, Tim.
[27:57.25]Much appreciated, dude.
[28:01.67]Yeah, I mean, we roll the dice sometimes on this stream.
[28:05.89]You know?
[28:07.99]So... You know, sometimes you play a game like Monster Rancher 3 and it's... Sometimes, you know, a home run goes 500 feet over the fence...
[28:18.55]Sometimes you pop up into the infield.
[28:22.37]So... Unfortunately, we popped up into the infield tonight.
[28:27.03]Kind of struck out on that game.
[28:29.65]It's not that it was a bad game.
[28:30.72]It's just... I feel like I loved Monster Rancher 1 and 2 so much that 3... I don't know.
[28:37.38]The magic kind of got sucked out for me.
[28:41.60]But thank you, dude.
[28:42.62]Appreciate it.
[28:45.02]Thank you to...

[29:07.52]I'm a very high brow.
[29:09.58]I don't talk about that kind of shit on stream.
[29:14.34]Another $50 donation here that I missed.
[29:16.08]Thank you, Eefs, for the $50.

[29:26.03]Love you, and also this game is top fucking notch.
[29:29.00]Thank you, Eefs.
[29:31.40]I'll be there tomorrow, for sure.
[29:33.92]I'm gonna be in the lobby just kind of grazing around and eating cookies and drinking coffee for like a couple hours.
[29:39.48]I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.
[29:43.48]I'm just gonna be so... I'm going to see some people there too.
[29:47.08]So, that'll be fun.
[29:49.99]Should be interesting.

[29:53.58]The official, official meetup will be Saturday.
[29:56.24]But, again, if you send me a tweet, I'll just tell you where I'm eating a fucking donut.

[30:03.04]And come by and say hello.
[30:05.44]But, uh, give me, I have to, I gotta pee really badly.

[31:14.57]I'm going to get halfway up there and... It's all good.
[31:24.67]I've been live for three hours.
[31:26.62]I need to hydrate.
[31:27.38]No, I need to drink less water.
[31:32.42]Anyways, thank you, Eefs.
[31:33.40]Appreciate it, man.
[31:34.68]Please flag me down if you will at PAX.
[31:38.08]FlavaGut, thanks for the $1.
[31:39.31]Nice haircut.
[31:39.87]Thank you.
[31:42.31]That's right.
[31:44.21]Frekster, thanks for the $1.
[31:45.29]I liked your old hair better.
[31:46.31]Yeah, I said it.
[31:47.19]Well, we got two conflicting opinions there.
[31:50.37]I'm not sure which one of those is the correct opinion.
[31:52.99]I like them both.
[31:55.02]Thank you, Eefs, again for the $5.
[31:56.42]Also, I still need that hug.
[31:57.96]So if I do see you at PAX PS, you look like you have a pompadour wig from Hairspray.
[32:04.80]Yeah, man, track me down.
[32:06.64]Come find me, and I'll be very available.
[32:09.98]You know, I might even just hang out in one of the free play rooms.
[32:14.33]Just get like a console and be like a weirdo or something.
[32:16.31]We'll find out.
[32:17.53]I'm up in the air until Saturday.
[32:20.81]Brewekfast.
[32:21.93]Thanks for the $15, dude.
[32:22.59]Hello, Jerma.
[32:25.34]Hey, can you do me a huge favor?
[32:26.86]My dad's in a coma and I can't seem to wake him.
[32:30.76]The only thing I can think of is having someone from Boston say, Worcestershire.
[32:37.12]I don't know what to do.
[32:37.73]Well, I just said it.
[32:40.49]Hopefully, you know, Worcestershire.
[32:42.39]Worcestershire.
[32:44.51]Worchester.
[32:46.91]Thank you, Breakfast.
[32:47.65]Appreciate it, man.
[32:52.27]He woke up.
[32:53.55]What?
[32:56.89]God.
[32:59.71]But thank you so much, man, for the $15.
[33:02.76]Spectac, thanks for the $1, Jerma.
[33:04.12]Why are you breaking your own rules by playing an anime game?
[33:08.62]I don't have any rules.
[33:09.38]I just have guidelines.
[33:11.00]All the guidelines and you'll be fine.
[33:14.51]MetalSan, thanks for the 25 cents.
[33:16.39]Breeding stats.
[33:17.13]Each monster has a specific base stat distribution and affinity towards specific stats.
[33:21.72]This affects how much parent final stats affect the offspring.
[33:25.90]The easiest way to make a super monster is to use two breeds with base stats that are very similar and focusing on those.
[33:29.96]A monster with a real low base stat... Is this about Monster Rancher 2?
[33:33.68]Do they have children in Monster Rancher 3?
[33:39.74]Guidelines are basically rules.
[33:41.20]I mean, they're slight rules.
[33:45.29]they're things that you they're pushing you in the right direction right they're not laws they're just suggestions but thank you for the tips metal sand we will continue Monster Rancher we'll go back to it eefs again thanks for the one dollar can't wait to see the drop top goal ultra instinct in the tournament of power against warlock dj snoopy that's right
[34:15.54]lightning rider thanks for the five dollars I won't play any anime games why do you guys think this is an anime it wasn't an anime game how was that an anime game thank you metal sand again for the 25 cents I have to go to class now craft us a meme to surpass even the legends of pikachu and beanbag Sonic
[34:46.14]That's the thing.
[34:46.52]You can't craft in that game.
[34:47.68]It's not fair.
[34:48.22]It's not cool.
[34:51.26]Also, Comfort Eagle again, thanks for the 10,000 bits.
[34:58.53]Appreciate it.
[35:03.01]That was from way earlier.
[35:03.97]That was from three hours ago.
[35:09.89]Much appreciated.
[35:14.69]Thank you, dude.
[35:15.97]Sorry, I'm getting, like, texted right now.
[35:17.47]Hold on.
[35:17.85]Give me one sec.
[35:18.41]Give me one second.
[35:31.37]Uh, thank you to Frexter for the $1.
[35:32.91]I've been meaning to ask, since you mentioned a while back, that you also have insomnia.
[35:37.96]Do you have any tips that have worked for you?
[35:39.44]Because I'm currently just addicted to sleeping pills.
[35:41.50]Well, that's not good.
[35:44.00]That is not a good thing.
[35:47.45]I'm going to give you some tips here because you don't want to be doing that.
[35:50.57]You want to stay very far away from that.
[35:55.57]If you're having trouble sleeping, the best thing you can do is eat in the morning.
[36:02.76]You'd be surprised that what keeps you actually awake at night is knowing that you're hungry or knowing that you will be hungry in like an hour and needing to eat.
[36:13.26]Try to eat when you get up in the morning.
[36:15.61]Try to abstain from eating food after like 9, 10, or 11 o'clock.
[36:22.39]PM.
[36:24.07]Because what happens is you eat like 4 in the morning, 3 in the morning.
[36:27.52]I'm starving!
[36:28.24]And you eat a bunch of fucking food and it messes up your whole clock.
[36:33.84]Try to push yourself back a couple hours every few nights.
[36:37.47]So let's say you're waking up at like 3 in the morning, right?
[36:40.21]Or you're waking up at like 4 in the morning.
[36:41.69]Or you're going to bed at like 7 a.m.
[36:42.81]and you're waking up at like 5 in the afternoon.
[36:45.69]Try to just go backwards.
[36:47.15]So try to go to sleep at like 6 a.m.
[36:48.99]and wake up at 4.
[36:50.14]Then try to go to bed at 5 a.m.
[36:51.66]and wake up at 3, right?
[36:53.18]Just continue to pull yourself back till you're in the right spot.
[36:56.06]And then make sure you eat in the morning.
[37:01.36]Not anything big.
[37:03.62]Just a small breakfast, a small lunch, and a nice dinner.
[37:07.56]And try to stay away from eating after 11 o'clock.
[37:12.04]And even still, I have so much trouble with it.
[37:15.00]Even now.
[37:16.40]I've done these tactics many times and fixed my schedule for like a couple months at a time.
[37:20.40]And then something else happens.
[37:22.58]Boom.
[37:23.34]Back to going to bed at 5 o'clock in the morning.
[37:25.82]It's kind of just the way I am.
[37:30.16]Staying away from electronics late at night works as well.
[37:32.26]Yes, it does.
[37:34.42]It's so hard to do this, and I cannot tell you that I don't do this, because I do this.
[37:41.08]I sit in the bed, I have my iPad, and I sit there until I fucking fall asleep, and I just look at videos, and go on Reddit, and read comments, and check out stuff for videos, or for streams, or I just kind of sit there and do whatever for like four straight hours.
[37:58.39]You really can't do that.
[38:00.11]That keeps you awake.
[38:04.02]But that's pretty much the best advice that I have.
[38:10.03]But I wish you the best of luck.
[38:12.25]You really don't want to stay on sleeping pills.
[38:14.15]You become so dependent to them that you can't sleep without them.
[38:17.05]So just be very careful with that.
[38:20.45]Also, if you're really having that much trouble, your doctor can really help you out there.
[38:26.26]And you can go on real prescription sleeping aids.
[38:30.93]that are under the guise of a doctor and you keep in touch with the doctor and you can get off of them and sleeping pills you never want to take them long term that's what I'm doing by being here I know right well wish you the best of luck man thank you to bit slave for the 25 cents got a new plan I'm hooking the kids up with some of your memes they pay quality bits for them
[38:58.91]Well, I mean, if you're going to hook up people with my quality memes, I need at least 60%, you know?
[39:08.20]Otherwise, what's stopping me from calling the quality meme police on you, you know?
[39:12.04]I think it's protection money, right?
[39:16.55]One call to the meme police and you'd be fucked, man.
[39:20.73]You know, 70%.
[39:21.03]You can keep 30%.
[39:29.37]I should exclusively stream from 11 to 5 a.m.
[39:33.01]Oh my, no, that would kill me.
[39:37.10]You know how weird you are and how fucked up you act?
[39:40.98]After waking up at 5 o'clock, like going to bed at like 5, ugh.
[39:47.02]Going to sleep at 5 a.m.
[39:48.20]and waking up at like 4 p.m.
[39:49.74]every day turns you into a freak.
[39:53.62]It happens to me all the time.
[39:54.59]Yeah.
[39:55.94]You start to not even be able to have conversations with people.
[39:58.86]I'll go to the store, and I will feel like I'm in somebody else's body.
[40:01.91]After like two or three weeks of waking up at five o'clock in the afternoon, I'll go into CVS, and I'll be buying something, and it's just like, I'm floating around CVS.
[40:12.13]Like, where, where am I?
[40:13.85]Yeah, um, I need, I need, uh, what did I come in here for?
[40:18.35]I came in here- what did I come in here for?
[40:19.69]I wanted to get a drink.
[40:21.55]No, uh, toilet paper.
[40:23.55]I don't- yeah, I came in- here you go, here's the money.
[40:25.75]And like, you hand it to them and you're so awkward handing them the credit card.
[40:30.65]You've- then they- you can feel them knowing how weird you are.
[40:35.34]I hate that feeling of being like on 50 drugs when you're on a reverse schedule.
[40:43.36]You're just on total autopilot and your brain can't even function.
[40:47.84]And sometimes, like, here's like the funny part, and here's like a quote.
[40:51.34]Here comes an excuse from Jeremy.
[40:54.48]I've been like that so many times on these streams.
[40:58.18]Like, it's not even funny.
[41:00.33]Like, I would say, how many times do you think I've streamed on Twitch total over the last, like, five years?
[41:10.91]What do you think it's been?
[41:14.60]At least, like, four or five hundred times?
[41:20.66]Two or three?
[41:22.08]Probably 500?
[41:22.92]Like 600, 700?
[41:27.43]Okay, so if I streamed 500 times on Twitch in the last five years, I would say probably 125 of those, I was one of those weirdo autopilot freaks.
[41:39.21]And I just couldn't do anything.
[41:43.60]That's happened probably at least a hundred times.
[41:46.18]And then I'm sitting there going like, shit, I don't know what to fucking do with myself.
[41:49.80]What was I doing?
[41:50.56]I was going this way.
[41:53.92]I don't even, I need to go back to CVS.
[42:01.47]Skate 3.
[42:03.49]Like the Kingdom Come stream.
[42:05.33]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[42:06.29]Like sometimes I'm just on such extreme sleep deprived, sleep weirdo autopilot.
[42:14.01]second metro game probably are you right now no no I got up okay today I woke up at like 12 today which is that's not great but it's not five if you stream three days a week you stream 608 times but so it's always a weird mess
[42:36.50]Day one of the Kingdom Come stream was pretty hilariously bad.
[42:40.02]I'm certain I was probably like that.
[42:41.52]I probably woke up like an hour before the stream started.
[42:44.17]And was just like... Kingdom Come, how do I play the game?
[42:53.63]It's so funny because people sometimes, uh, I get rightfully criticized for, dude, how the fuck are you not prepared to, like, play this game right now?
[43:03.90]Like, you're, like, 20 minutes late.
[43:06.18]What, what are you doing?
[43:07.10]And you, like, can't even function?
[43:08.50]Like, that's because you probably, I probably woke up, like, 30 minutes before the stream started.
[43:14.36]Sometimes it's like I woke up, like, an hour and 10 minutes before the stream started and I just house a coffee and I just get up and I'm like, alright, let me sit down.
[43:22.50]Okay, what time is that?
[43:24.58]It's Metro Last Light.
[43:26.60]That's what I gotta do.
[43:27.52]I'm so sorry.
[43:30.02]I'm gonna be a little late to the stream.
[43:34.45]Sorry, I'll be right there.
[43:37.29]That's happened at least a hundred times in the last five years.
[43:45.11]So there you go.
[43:46.39]This is one of the many excuses.
[43:50.67]I'm a fucking gremlin.
[43:53.24]Anyways, let's move on from that.
[43:55.08]Bitslave again, thanks for the 25 cents.
[43:56.52]This kid is OD'd on memes.
[44:01.19]Sucks for him, but I checked his pockets and I got more bits for you.
[44:03.77]I know you want us to get you with these bits, but that's fucked up, man.
[44:08.23]Do we have a new roleplayer in the chat here?
[44:10.99]We have a guy that pretends to be Garfield.
[44:13.88]And now we have a guy that roleplays like robbing people and giving me their money.
[44:19.34]I'm not sure I'm okay with this roleplay.
[44:22.62]But thank you.
[44:23.18]I appreciate it, dude.
[44:25.66]Uh, here he is again.
[44:26.57]BitSlave again.
[44:27.23]If the feds used the RanRan and spotted our shitty car wash, we need a new plan to launder your bits.
[44:35.05]That was my only plan.
[44:38.55]Uh, LimeCatMaster, thanks for the $2.50.
[44:40.82]Jeremiah, I left my computer for literally 60 seconds.
[44:43.82]And I come back to hear about you putting your health at risk for the Emoji Movie.
[44:47.72]What the fuck?
[44:51.48]You know what I heard?
[44:53.00]And this is just absolutely disgusting.
[44:56.12]I don't know how true this is, but I heard the new Popeye movie with the new 3D animated directed by Genndy Tartatovsky, whatever his name is, got canned to make the emoji movie.
[45:10.80]Is that true?
[45:13.70]How horrible is that?
[45:15.10]We would have got a brand new Popeye movie by one of the greatest animation directors ever.
[45:21.83]And they made the fucking emoji movie instead.
[45:27.11]Yeah, what were they thinking?
[45:30.25]What?
[45:31.24]How can you not make both of those movies at the same time?
[45:36.08]Was it because Robin Williams was Popeye?
[45:37.66]No, Tom Kenny was Popeye.
[45:41.07]Tom Kenny, the guy that is SpongeBob, was Popeye.
[45:44.33]They did a, like, two or three minute animaniacs, animatic, a little trailer of animation.
[45:51.53]They put it up on YouTube.
[45:53.17]It looked fucking cool.
[46:00.00]Yeah, this is like a three minute kind of half trailer.
[46:03.28]Hopefully they bring that back after they saw the catastrophe that was the Emoji Movie, you know.
[46:11.73]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[46:12.77]You should have Goosebumps choose your own adventure books as backup when streams start to die.
[46:18.21]That's not a bad idea.
[46:21.40]Just have a hundred of them back there and just grab one every time Comcast has problems.
[46:25.88]I'm into that.
[46:26.64]I'll do that.
[46:27.04]I'm gonna buy like a hundred of them tonight.
[46:28.66]No, I'm not.
[46:30.20]Easy.
[46:31.02]Slow down, like Betty Bigspender.
[46:36.63]Thank you, Ivory, for the 45 cents.
[46:38.11]Just a quick tip in case you don't know, if you're testing your internet speed at testnet, oh, we went over this already.
[46:44.32]Yeah, it's true, but you still need to sometimes.
[46:50.02]Bill Blow Baggies, thanks for the three bucks.
[46:54.03]Hey, loving the Monster Rancher streams.
[46:55.33]They're great.
[46:55.75]Also, are you planning to go to PAX this week?
[46:58.29]Yeah, we've talked about it a few times.
[46:59.81]Hopefully you're around to hear about it.
[47:01.03]If not, then yes, I'll be there.
[47:03.11]Saturday is going to be the official meetup, but I'll be poking around Thursday and Friday as well.
[47:09.57]I'm not going to be there on Sunday.
[47:12.71]So I will not be at PAX on Sunday, Sunday night.
[47:16.91]So hopefully you can catch me there at some point over the two or three days that I will be there in full.
[47:20.83]Eating donuts in the lobby.
[47:25.53]Thank you, Lightning Rider, for the $1.10.
[47:27.27]I also forgot, when is the Peggle stream?
[47:29.47]I already beat that whole game and got a bunch of fucking awesome trick shots.
[47:33.47]Don't need to play it again, you know.
[47:34.61]Not a big deal.
[47:38.32]Bitslave, again, thanks for the $0.25.
[47:39.32]I took care of the Comcasters for you.
[47:41.18]Turns out they didn't like how you were going about getting all these bits.
[47:44.66]Needless to say, they... Comcast is always a problem for me.
[47:52.11]It seems... I don't even know, though.
[47:53.63]Lately, it seems...
[47:55.84]It seems like Twitch has been having problems.
[47:58.04]Me connecting to Twitch's servers seem to be the problem.
[48:03.14]I'm not sure if their East Coast Ingest servers are... Something's wrong with them?
[48:07.30]But I've done speed tests while streaming.
[48:11.72]And it's perfect.
[48:13.88]And like you saw, it came right back after I changed locations.
[48:19.09]I don't know.
[48:22.11]Thank you to...
[48:25.08]Bitslave again for the 25 cents.
[48:26.32]The bits came in from the match fixing.
[48:27.88]It's kind of harsh how you forced Drop Top to fake that dive.
[48:31.38]But hey, anything for bits, right?
[48:35.04]Oh, God.
[48:36.46]Again, here it is.
[48:37.24]Comcast actually wants to do a deal with you.
[48:38.86]They'll throttle your internet, but they'll give you bits for it.
[48:41.36]I went ahead and gave them the green light.
[48:45.11]Hey, Lindsay, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[48:47.31]What the fuck is happening?
[48:49.73]I'm not sure.
[48:52.11]Thank you, Lindsay, for the $10.

[49:25.14]I was gonna pick a game that I actually know how to play.
[49:47.77]and try to go through it as fast as I can and just have splits on the screen.
[49:53.73]Never came to fruition though.
[49:55.83]But it's something I wanted to do.
[49:58.65]Thank you BroLuck for the five bucks.
[49:59.73]Thank you Lightning Rider for the $1.
[50:03.33]Statistically speaking, with 2,250 people in the chat, it should be six birthdays every day.
[50:07.80]That's an interesting statistic.
[50:13.38]Any big plans for a stream coming?
[50:14.76]Yes.
[50:15.86]Actually, today I was told by one of my friends that there is some monumental progress that has been made securing a specific location for a soon-to-be upcoming live shoot.
[50:28.93]So, significant progress has been made on one of these projects, and hopefully it's, you'll see it soon, hopefully.
[50:35.74]I was told that today.

[52:14.72]Because it seems like hot sauce is going to squelch everything else.
[52:21.22]Thank you, Wild, her buddy for the 60 cents.
[52:22.76]Jerma's Ted Talk.
[52:23.52]What does purple sound like?
[52:29.05]It probably exists.
[52:30.69]Don't put it past Ted.
[52:32.41]There's probably a Ted Talk about how hearing colors and experiencing colors and stuff.
[52:36.89]Go look it up.
[52:38.76]Don't put it past whatever his name is.
[52:41.15]Ted.
[52:43.43]What's Ted's last name?
[52:46.73]Whatever it is.
[52:48.07]Garblstein?

[52:54.54]Thank you to Midveed.
[52:59.24]Thank you to Midveed for the 10 bucks.
[53:01.06]Just says Craigasm.
[53:02.98]Thank you, Midveed.
[53:04.63]Appreciate the 10 bucks, dude.
[53:08.13]CL Hammer, thanks for the five bucks.
[53:09.91]You're missing one piece.
[53:11.67]Santa Mario is actually a mix of Elmo and Santa.
[53:16.72]I could see that.
[53:25.90]uh rap rap dj rap divulge rappy devolved thank you for the one dollar hi Jerma uh I have schizophrenia and my therapist told me a really good way to describe it as having Twitch chat in your brain at all time oh well I'm sorry to hear that that's I mean Twitch chat is um is
[53:53.71]in fact a thing um thank you for the one dollar though wrap take care of yourself um that's an interesting take on it but if that's true I'm really sorry to hear about that uh who else we got here
[54:23.66]Monty the Moose thanks for the 25 cents.
[54:25.88]Fucking kill this blob of shit already.
[54:28.28]Don't worry, you won't be seeing him ever again.
[54:30.44]Kill Gannon asked about the PO box.
[54:33.12]I don't have a PO box and I probably never will.
[54:36.24]And you knew he was going to show up at some point because he shows up every stream.
[54:38.98]And here he is, GarfieldTheMondayKiller with 25 cents.
[54:42.65]The relationships you have with the monsters is actually really endearing.
[54:46.61]I've never had a pet of my own.
[54:48.83]I am a cat, for obvious reasons, but the way you talk about Otto is real cute.
[54:52.11]For as many swears as you say, I've always thought you ran a real wholesome show.
[54:55.97]You're the only guy I've watched who was completely respectful, level-headed, downright kind to all your fans.
[55:01.46]There's nothing fake about you, Jerma.
[55:02.90]You never compromise your voice.
[55:04.84]Love you.
[55:06.52]Forgot to put a lasagna joke in.
[55:07.88]Whoops.
[55:12.78]I've kind of brought this up before, but you know how tiring it is to be another person?
[55:21.01]A long time ago... I decided... That I was just gonna be... I was just gonna be me... And I was gonna just... Kinda have fun and do whatever, right?
[55:32.48]It's tiring... To be another person.
[55:36.51]And a lot of people...
[55:39.38]get too caught up in trying to be something that they might not actually be and they put on like this persona that just they have to keep up every day and when you keep up this kind of persona it's hard to do you can't do that every day
[56:04.36]It's much easier for me to just say whatever I say and be whoever I am than it is to me to pretend I'm somebody that I'm actually not.
[56:12.92]Am I listening to a Ted Talk right now?
[56:14.36]Yeah, you are.
[56:15.12]Yeah, you're listening to a fucking Ted Talk.
[56:24.21]That's so funny.
[56:27.89]You could put the Ted Talk little water droplet sink drop sound that like...
[56:34.59]Put a fake audience behind and just take that clip that I just said.
[56:38.93]It would make sense.
[56:43.15]Thank you, Garfield.
[56:43.75]Thank you, Dunkey Horizon.
[56:45.47]Thank you, Dunkey Arisen, for the $1.
[56:48.31]At this point, Jerma, you may as well be playing Doki Doki Literature Club.
[56:56.37]Thanks, dude.
[56:56.85]Thank you, Monty the Moose, for the $0.25.
[56:58.13]If you don't stream a Goosebumps Choose Your Own Adventure book, I will call Otto a bad dog.
[57:02.30]Don't worry.
[57:04.79]That's a great idea.
[57:05.53]I'm going to buy all the Goosebumps Choose Your Own Adventure books and just have them in a stack back there.
[57:12.74]And every time we have internet problems, I'm just going back there and grabbing one of the books, sitting down, and doing that.
[57:25.46]Thank you, Eefs, for the $5.
[57:26.78]When are you going to be at PAX, like, other than the meetup on Saturday?
[57:29.56]Because I need to find you and meet that hand and shake that guy.
[57:35.90]I'll be there tomorrow I'll be there Friday and I'll be there on Saturday obviously so just over the course of the next couple of days uh no you're not you're going to scream and cry at your internet and forget uh
[57:54.43]I will be around tomorrow afternoon.
[57:57.73]Just kind of hanging out.
[57:59.23]I plan on going in and meeting up with some people.
[58:01.07]I know we talked about the other day.
[58:03.43]Criken wants to hang out.
[58:06.22]Vinny wants to say hello.
[58:08.04]Like, of course I want to say hello to Vinny.
[58:11.64]There's at least four or five people that I wanted to go and like see at PAX.
[58:17.38]So I might be with them.
[58:19.90]I might be hanging out with them.
[58:20.84]I might be walking around.
[58:23.05]But you're going to have to kind of flag me down Thursday, Friday.
[58:27.31]If you're not going to be there on Saturday.
[58:29.45]I'm going to have to try to run into you.
[58:30.99]Or I'll just make a tweet or something of where I am on Thursday.
[58:33.71]And maybe I can just bump into you.
[58:37.66]Why won't I say your full name?
[58:41.20]Because your full name is gross.
[58:45.86]Yeah.
[58:46.48]It just got deleted.
[58:47.60]Shit.
[58:52.06]Right when I said it it's deleted.
[58:55.04]I was just like why would I and I ain't deleted Look can I call you glorious a now?
[59:04.89]Like you you like they're like the the the the annals of history the annals of history, right?
[59:12.37]Glorious annals of history.
[59:14.54]How do you pronounce that?
[59:15.28]Is it annals of history?
[59:18.88]How do you actually pronounce that
[59:21.43]Is it Annals of History?
[59:30.19]How do I say... It's A-N-N-A-L-S.
[59:35.74]Annals of History.
[59:40.10]Okay.
[59:40.86]I'm going to call you Glorious Annals.
[59:46.30]Thank you.
[59:48.14]Wait, he didn't even give me bits.
[59:49.80]I just, like, thanked him.
[59:51.76]All he did is he got, like, fucking deleted in the chat and, like, made me talk.
[59:55.93]Aw, thanks a lot.
[59:57.31]Thanks a lot for those fucking bits.
[60:00.95]Uh, DunkeyArmisen, thanks for the $1.
[60:02.39]Try Doki Doki.
[60:03.13]It's better than this shit.
[60:04.33]Jesus Christ.
[60:05.87]Doki Doki again.
[60:06.67]Haha, pea sandwich with garlic.
[60:08.57]Alright, we're gonna skip that one.
[60:09.95]Zin Shin, thanks for the $1.
[60:11.11]Oh, whoa, what is this?
[60:14.95]Thank you.
[60:17.52]Thank you to Garfield2 for the $1.
[60:19.59]Love you, Jimbo.
[60:20.89]Thank you.
[60:23.23]Thank you, Bitslave.
[60:24.23]Again, Jeremy, you crossed the line.
[60:25.95]You did not throw Passion of the Christ.
[60:28.11]I refuse to sell memes to kids.
[60:29.89]I'll still ad farm and break people's legs for you, though.
[60:32.80]God.
[60:35.02]I'm so glad I didn't do that.
[60:36.70]It was on the verge of happening.
[60:38.28]And I'm glad I just turned off the... I turned off the enabler, the webcam.
[60:43.46]That's why I can't have the webcam on.
[60:45.22]Because it enables me to do shit that I would regret in five minutes.
[60:49.32]Do I want to say Garfield's full name?
[60:56.91]Because that's not his fucking full name.
[60:59.37]It's Garfield Davis.
[61:03.05]Garfield Davis.
[61:05.30]That's an incorrect name.
[61:06.34]That's a fake spelling.
[61:07.26]I'm not going to say a fake spelling.
[61:12.41]Thank you Wiley Spencer for the $1.
[61:15.50]Where am I?
[61:17.30]Where am I?
[61:18.02]What are you linking?

[61:19.08]Oh, it's just the snort again.
[61:24.44]Okay, fine.
[61:26.93]Thank you to Wiley Spencer.
[61:29.39]Where am I?
[61:30.07]Who are you?
[61:30.69]You're not my son.
[61:31.37]Where's my son?
[61:34.53]Thank you Bitslave for the 25 cents.
[61:35.89]Jeremy, I sold your son for bits.
[61:38.56]Thanks, man.
[61:39.08]I don't have a son.
[61:43.10]Swifty bagel.
[61:43.94]Thank you for the $1.
[61:44.78]I'm so tempted to send you a massive CD organizer Oh God, I don't know.
[61:50.60]I don't here's the thing.
[61:51.36]I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do with all this shit.
[61:54.67]I Have like a hundred and fifty CDs and CD cases and DVDs here.
[61:59.45]What am I gonna do with this shit?
[62:02.87]Anybody want this Does anybody want this shit
[62:09.39]If I, like, put a Polaroid of me giving, like, the thumbs up and sign them all, would anybody want them?
[62:17.51]Do a fan giveaway for each console?
[62:22.07]No, what if I promised to, like, blow a snot rocket into one of them randomly so you have to come across it?
[62:26.95]Is that legal?
[62:31.40]Give them away at PAX.
[62:32.74]Yeah, I guess I'll take it.
[62:39.32]Signed copy of Click, not by Adam Sandler, by me.
[62:43.52]Like I made the movie.
[62:50.60]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1 here.
[62:55.90]Jerma, do you have any tips on how to make a live commentary video?
[62:58.38]I happen to have a hard time on focusing on what to say and playing the game.
[63:03.36]I still have trouble doing that, so.
[63:06.77]I can't really give you that much advice.
[63:10.58]I would say... The best advice I've ever seen.
[63:17.43]And this isn't even my advice.
[63:20.27]I didn't even say this.
[63:21.03]Somebody else did.
[63:21.81]I don't know who it was, though.
[63:23.56]is to talk um to talk about stuff or to bring up things or to just kind of act the same way you would act in front of people like like your friends you know like all you guys here we we sit here and we have fun we just talk we make noises I'm assuming you do too um but just talking just normally just like the way you would talk to somebody you know
[63:54.33]That's, you know, people don't want to be forced to, you know, like I said, a lot of people just put on the act.
[64:02.82]And like, I was guilty of this shit fucking six years ago.
[64:06.16]Hey guys, what's going on?
[64:07.90]What's up, man?
[64:08.80]It's me, Jerma.
[64:09.88]Just wanted to let you guys know that I am ready to go.
[64:12.79]And so what we're gonna do today is, listen up, guys.
[64:16.89]Just slow down.
[64:18.81]Let your brain work first.
[64:20.91]And treat everybody, instead of treating them like this audience.
[64:24.71]Oh, hey, everybody.
[64:25.33]What's up, man?
[64:25.81]What's up, audience?
[64:27.28]Treat them like they want to be treated, like you want to be treated, like the way that you want to be talked to.
[64:31.92]I want to be talked to like this.
[64:34.36]Not like this, man!
[64:36.40]You know what I'm saying?
[64:37.08]Like, I... I don't want to be, like, talked to like that.
[64:40.06]Because that makes it seem... Doesn't that make it feel like someone's putting on a show for you?
[64:53.63]Just pretend you're... I want to be talked to... The Let's Play voice, yeah.
[65:01.59]Do we stream like that one day?
[65:03.10]People would actually be mad at me.
[65:04.70]And people would be...
[65:07.51]Talk to him just like a Ted Talk, like this, you know?
[65:12.90]But some people seem to like that.
[65:14.91]And that's fine.
[65:16.77]There is, like, the, quote, showmanship of being, like, a YouTuber or, like, a Twitch streamer, and there's an audience for it.
[65:23.94]I just, I'm just past that at this point.
[65:26.10]I just don't want to put on, like, the... I'll put on a, quote, a show, but not in the traditional sense, like, me acting, me sitting there being hyper-energetic and talking as if I'm in a room with a thousand people.
[65:43.09]That's the thing.
[65:44.19]There were, what, 2,500 people here?
[65:47.86]Right?
[65:48.02]There were 2,500, just about 2,200, 2,300 people or so here tonight.
[65:52.40]And a lot of people imagine that there's 2,300 people in a room in an auditorium, and they're up on a stage.
[65:59.22]But that's not the case.
[66:00.50]You're in fact sitting in a room.
[66:03.42]They're probably sitting in a room, or on the couch or something, or on the phone, or on the toilet.
[66:09.24]It's not an auditorium, and a lot of people treat it like an auditorium because they see view numbers.
[66:14.23]And they go, whoa, hold on a minute.
[66:16.79]There's people here.
[66:17.81]I have to fucking, I got to project.
[66:19.90]There's a fucking, it's a theater.
[66:25.70]But that's pretty much a thousand people on one couch.
[66:29.40]You said you were ending the stream an hour ago.
[66:35.06]Well, I end the live stream, but then we have to do the bits and the credits, man.
[66:44.74]But I mean, there's like a place for that type of interaction, right?
[66:51.15]I don't think it's bad.
[66:52.19]I just think that it's sort of the go-to for a lot of people.
[66:59.55]Yeah, I guarantee you at least half of you guys were on the toilet at some point during this stream.
[67:04.13]Guaranteed.
[67:04.55]I would bring those odds to Vegas.
[67:09.30]that at some point, at least 50% of the viewers that were at this stream, at some point over the four or five hours, were in the bathroom.
[67:19.50]Stamp it.
[67:28.50]Even if you peed.
[67:29.40]Even if you're holding your phone up with one hand and peeing.
[67:32.41]That, that counts.
[67:34.45]I've done that.
[67:41.45]I really appreciate the effort you put into your streams.
[67:43.23]It's hilarious.
[67:46.53]Well, that's... There are... There are people that watch this stream, right?
[67:55.92]I owe it to the people that watch this stream to try.
[68:00.28]That's it.
[68:03.50]That's the long and short of it.
[68:04.76]That's it.
[68:06.95]If you're going to give me your time, I'm going to try to make it worth your time.
[68:14.31]As much as I can.
[68:15.33]And sometimes it's a failure, sometimes it isn't.
[68:18.74]Sometimes it's a success, sometimes it isn't.
[68:22.50]But I think about that every day.
[68:25.32]People watch this fucking garbage?
[68:31.89]I guess so.
[68:32.87]I guess.
[68:41.41]And there's a lot more on the way, so stay tuned.
[68:45.57]I hope you enjoy it.
[68:51.32]You like the end segments better than the actual stream sometimes?
[68:56.98]Well, yeah, this is just the way for us to just chill and decompress.
[69:04.21]Just talk about whatever.
[69:10.37]Let's see where we were before here we were at Thank you to bit slave again for the 25 cents for some reason people pay good bits for this I Don't know what this is.
[69:22.48]I'm afraid to click it.

[70:32.36]No, he made me say that!
[70:36.90]This was... Hey, look.
[70:39.80]Excuse me.
[70:41.26]He wrote that.
[70:42.36]I didn't write that.
[70:44.36]I didn't say that.
[70:45.34]He said that.
[70:46.24]I was just saying it.

[70:58.81]Hey, Jimmer, what's up, man?
[71:00.95]It's the Death Wraith from Psychology 101.
[71:02.81]I didn't know you were some kind of superstar Anilander.
[71:06.83]Hit me up, man.
[71:07.42]By the way, did you ever hook up with that guy Flanker?
[71:09.52]He was a big boy, huh?
[71:10.70]You're such a dog.
[71:13.42]Rewind to me sometime.
[71:14.46]No.
[71:16.06]This is reaching into the bag.
[71:19.65]You know.
[71:21.11]There's some rotten apples down there where you're reaching.
[71:25.54]They're in there.
[71:26.12]You gotta go... There's like four fully over-ripened bananas.
[71:31.41]And you grab the core of the apple.
[71:37.17]Thank you, Subadat, for the $2.50.
[71:42.24]Bill Blow Baggins.
[71:43.54]Thanks for the... Whatever.
[71:45.14]Bill Blow Baggies.
[71:46.70]Thanks for the two bucks.
[71:47.46]I'll be on the lookout for you at PAX.
[71:49.22]Might even bring some random game for you.
[71:52.65]If you do see me and you give me a game, I will gladly accept it.
[71:57.79]GarfieldTheMondayKiller again with 50 cents.
[71:59.88]Hey Jerma, I've been trying to get better at drawing recently because it's always been my dream to be an animator.
[72:05.12]I just drew BBB and Max Rebo, the blue elephant guy banned from Star Wars.
[72:12.74]Like most things in life, it was inspired by the great Jerma985.
[72:15.73]I got into character modeling after watching your Jerma rumbles and watching monsters beat each other up.
[72:21.55]I don't know how you can be so smart, funny, and creative so effortlessly.
[72:24.80]Garfield loves you, and Heathcliff says hi.
[72:29.14]You are far too kind, Garfield.
[72:31.22]Thank you.
[72:34.26]Good luck with your modeling endeavors.
[72:36.06]It's a lot of fun.
[72:36.80]It's fun to make monsters.
[72:40.19]Thank you, Nightfang7.
[72:41.87]NightfangX7 for the $1.
[72:42.99]Hey, Jerma, sorry for not being around last week for any of your streams.
[72:45.85]I was in a mental hospital for all of last week because of college got me so stressed.
[72:51.15]And caused me to start having thoughts of suicide.
[72:53.77]I just want to say thank you for always making me laugh and always keeping me positive.
[72:57.51]I've been following you since late 2013 and I'm glad that I've been a part of your loving community.
[73:01.59]Thank you.
[73:03.97]Nightfang, I'm really fucking sorry to hear that.
[73:09.21]Please, please, please do what you can to reach out to the proper people and the proper authorities of that matter, you know?
[73:22.32]I'm really, really sorry that that happened to you.
[73:28.93]Take a few weeks here.
[73:30.75]Would be my opinion.
[73:35.62]We all love you here, man.
[73:36.52]We do.
[73:37.84]All you guys here.
[73:41.49]Make sure you reach out to the proper places.
[73:44.05]There's a lot of good prevention hotlines there.
[73:49.39]Even you can talk to your doctor about it too.
[73:51.19]I'm sure you probably already got through that already.
[73:59.45]Try to stay positive.
[74:01.23]That's hard to say.
[74:02.00]I know that's such a cliche thing to say.
[74:05.24]Just stay positive.
[74:07.42]But the more you dig down into negative thoughts, you keep going.
[74:12.44]You keep going.
[74:13.36]And you keep going.
[74:13.96]And then it gets to a point where you get down to the bottom of the well.
[74:18.56]You know?
[74:18.86]You just try to make an effort to stay positive at least once a week, you know?
[74:25.90]It's tough.
[74:27.18]And obviously I don't know your situation.
[74:28.64]Your situation could be completely different, you know?
[74:32.72]But I would implore you to please reach out.
[74:36.76]Talk to your doctor.
[74:37.52]Talk to a therapist.
[74:38.92]Find out what's going on.
[74:41.90]But I wish you the absolute best, though, Nightfang.
[74:44.84]I really do.
[74:50.70]Take care of yourself, man.
[74:51.74]For real.
[75:00.19]Yeah, get a counsellor.
[75:03.05]Exercise, yeah, you just kind of have to stay active and stay on top of it.
[75:08.29]Because the thing about stuff like stress and depression, it kind of can come and go.
[75:14.44]You can get really, really super stressed out and super world closing in on you more than once, even if you get over it.
[75:23.22]So it's kind of like a never-ending battle that you have to deal with.
[75:30.07]And it's just the ways that you can fight back.
[75:33.11]The good ways to try.
[75:35.37]At least try.
[75:41.34]But take care of yourself, man.
[75:43.78]You are welcome here anytime.
[75:46.56]And please join the Discord and hang out there if you need more people to talk to.
[75:51.72]And again, reach out to the proper authorities in this matter.
[75:54.87]Because as much as I can say, there's not much I can do
[75:58.83]um to give you the actual help that you might need you know good luck to you man uh smelly boy thank you for the 25 cents I honestly love your and I'm just doing my best to get pp banned and make you say it as much as possible because it makes my walnut brain happy
[76:26.21]The fact that he called you a walnut brain.
[76:30.55]At least you're honest, right?
[76:33.33]At least you're being honest, you know?
[76:36.24]I respect it.
[76:37.48]I respect you for your honesty here.
[76:46.81]Oh, my God.
[76:47.37]Thank you, dude.
[76:48.47]John Arbuckle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[76:50.77]Just want to say a sub, so count that as a $5.
[76:54.55]Keep up the great work.
[76:55.37]Also, you look great.
[76:56.57]Almost as good as me.
[76:58.77]Thank you, John.
[77:00.67]No V, thanks for the $1.
[77:01.91]Just your weekly reminder to talk to Charlie about the official podcast.
[77:05.34]You forgot again.
[77:06.74]Well, PAX is coming up, and Easter, my family was over.
[77:11.20]We got in a big fucking argument.
[77:17.08]Next week.
[77:18.24]Remind me on Tuesday.
[77:20.66]You know what?
[77:21.18]Just, like, tell Charlie to throw a rock at my house.
[77:23.89]You know what I mean?
[77:25.37]Just, like, tell Charlie to find me at PAX and throw a rock at me at PAX.
[77:29.43]Just with a note on it that just says, hey, get on the podcast.
[77:31.75]Here's the date and time we want you on there.
[77:42.25]A big... No, not a big rock.
[77:44.99]A small enough rock that won't cause any damage, but it'll get attention.
[77:48.87]We're talking... We're talking like a beach rock.
[77:52.21]Those things weigh like three ounces.
[77:54.43]You know, I'm talking about the little shiny ones that are blue and white and... Ooh, they're shiny and cool.
[77:59.15]A beach rock.
[78:03.09]I don't throw it at my head, throw it at the ground so it goes like... In front of me and I go, what the fuck was that?
[78:09.40]Oh!
[78:10.52]Charlie!
[78:10.88]Hey!
[78:18.01]uh thanks thank you tara I did it again I called you tara again thank you for the one dollar dude uh apples like flux really help me with insomnia they dim and yellow your screen later he said apps not apples uh they dim and yellow your screen late at night to help prevent eye strain and insomnia the blue light of monitors phone signals your brain to stay awake
[78:45.74]Apple actually does have a night mode now that does the same thing.
[78:50.76]But it doesn't help the fact that you actually still sit there and want to read more dumb shit and watch more dog videos, you know?
[78:55.66]It's not necessarily the brightness for me, as much as it is... That was a funny dog video.
[79:02.81]What's the next one?
[79:04.99]Oh, a 42-minute compilation?
[79:07.01]Sure, I've got time.
[79:10.95]Thank you to Dr. Clay for the 25 cents.
[79:12.80]Don't feel bad about the wrong screen mistake.
[79:14.48]I didn't even notice and I'm watching the stream.
[79:16.68]Thanks, dude.
[79:17.60]Robo Gandalf, thanks for the $1.
[79:19.10]Y'all eat ass.
[79:21.32]I'm not going to answer that.
[79:22.30]That's a question for somebody else.
[79:23.76]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 25 bits again.
[79:26.36]Garfield said he never had any pets.
[79:27.95]I thought John was his pet.
[79:29.07]I don't know.
[79:32.59]Garfield, say my full name or John will boner blast your lasagna.
[79:40.05]Fine.
[79:40.61]I'll say your fucking full name.
[79:43.03]Garfield... Har... ... ... ... ... ...
[80:11.33]You happy?
[80:13.69]Lightning Rider, thanks for the one dollar.
[80:15.19]Hey Jerboa, I finally have been able to enjoy Bloodborne.
[80:17.03]I didn't know how to equip a weapon until I watched a video of you playing it.
[80:19.73]I spent about three hours fighting with my fists annoyed.
[80:22.33]Welcome to Dark Souls, noob!
[80:32.26]No, but for real.
[80:35.48]It is, those games are hard.
[80:36.48]If you've never played them before, those games are fucking hard.
[80:40.68]Those games are not easy to just barely get into.
[80:43.90]I wish you luck.
[80:46.98]That's one of my favorite games ever made.
[80:48.16]Have fun.
[80:50.00]It's fantastic.
[80:53.76]Uh, UV sensitive.
[80:54.80]Thanks for the 69 cents.
[80:56.00]Hello, Jerma.
[80:56.48]I don't know if I should have a water birth.
[81:01.60]I'm afraid of losing the placenta.
[81:03.15]I'm not even going to read the rest of this.
[81:05.19]Thank you, Canjams, for the $1.
[81:06.47]Hey, Jerma, will you be at PAX Sunday?
[81:08.23]I just got in.
[81:08.79]Sorry, I have you said before.
[81:11.33]I love you, dude.
[81:12.17]I am not going to be at PAX on Sunday.
[81:16.31]If I am, it will be some, it'll kind of be like a miracle.
[81:21.16]So, I'll be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[81:24.92]Sunday is looking like I'm not going to be able to go.
[81:28.94]But if you're there any other day, come find me.
[81:32.99]I'll be very easy to find.
[81:33.93]I'll be in the lobby.
[81:37.05]Thank you, though.
[81:37.87]Thank you to BroLuck for the $1.
[81:39.33]Give us your best snort.
[81:40.27]I already did.
[81:42.53]Uh, World, thank you, World, for the 10 bucks.
[81:44.89]Jeremy, I want to say that I was in a similar situation as the guy earlier.
[81:48.59]Back in last May, I was in a partial hospitalization due to thoughts of suicide.
[81:53.83]Watching your VODs every night when they let me honestly really helped me out.
[81:58.39]I started watching your content after my dad committed suicide in July of 2010, and you've helped me laugh and feel positive ever since then.
[82:06.43]Really appreciate your content and the kind of person you are.
[82:08.35]You've helped me and surely countless others.
[82:11.91]World, first of all, that's an immensely terrible thing.
[82:20.64]And even you sharing that is probably pretty difficult to do.
[82:26.22]So just know from my perspective, this is what we were talking about before, like 20, 30 minutes ago.
[82:40.52]this whole thing like the fact that you give me any attention at all the fact that you've been watching and I want that to happen I want you to feel good I want you to feel better you know like I want you guys to leave this stream happier or better than when you came in here in the first place
[83:09.86]It's... And however I can do that, with some different ideas, or try new things, or try to make sketches, or anything.
[83:21.54]Like, anything I can think of that would be fun for everybody here.
[83:25.26]Or make you, you know, at least relax a little bit, or laugh.
[83:33.70]That's, like, the only fucking thing I care about.
[83:35.44]It's been the only thing I've ever really cared about.
[83:41.06]At least on YouTube and Twitch.
[83:42.28]For real.
[83:48.05]And I want to continue to do so.
[83:50.97]So... Just know, man, that... I'm... I'm really sorry about the shit that's happened to you in your life.
[84:00.22]But... Just... You gotta stick with it, man.
[84:03.20]You gotta stay in there.
[84:07.48]and there are like I said before there are plenty of places to go and talk to people that can help I wish you the best thank you so much for even considering to sit in this stream and watch it much love to you man and moving on we got uh dubski dude for the one dollar
[84:31.05]Concerning your YouTube advice, say, hypothetically, I've been doing the exact opposite of your advice for the last three years.
[84:35.94]How fucked would I be?
[84:36.86]Hypothetically, of course, haha, I'm just asking for a friend.
[84:41.98]You wouldn't be fucked.
[84:44.08]It's just... Look, YouTube now, it's hard to do that now.
[84:50.28]YouTube hit its apex.
[84:52.12]It hit its climax.
[84:54.77]Up in, I would say, somewhere around 2013, 2014.
[84:59.11]It was everybody.
[84:59.97]There was a ton of people making videos.
[85:02.00]The platform was great.
[85:03.32]It was awesome.
[85:03.96]There was so many people making great content.
[85:06.62]And then it hit the climax and then it started to come down.
[85:11.54]I'd say in like 2015, 2016 is when YouTube really started to come down in regards to monetization, viewership, site changes.
[85:22.39]So my best advice would seriously be
[85:26.99]I'm not even sure I would start, I would do a YouTube channel now.
[85:30.95]You know?
[85:32.43]I think that YouTube is old news.
[85:34.82]There are other things that you can try to tap into.
[85:37.60]You gotta try to tap into the next thing, you know what I mean?
[85:40.81]Because where did I start?
[85:42.87]I started making videos back when, you know, when there weren't very many people making videos.
[85:48.23]It was a lot easier for me to get my content seen than it is for anybody else starting now or that doesn't have a large audience or an audience big enough that they can continue to spread around.
[85:58.74]I think Twitch is a great place to, I mean, it's getting there now though.
[86:02.18]Twitch is becoming now what YouTube was back in 2013.
[86:08.16]It's getting to that point where, well, here we go.
[86:11.04]We're getting to the apex here.
[86:13.47]Twitch is huge.
[86:15.19]Here come a bunch of changes.
[86:17.03]Be careful.
[86:17.81]What happens?
[86:18.25]Do we go over the roller coaster?
[86:19.27]Are we going to go over the ride now?
[86:20.81]In like three years now, there'll be another site to go to.
[86:27.20]Who knows?
[86:29.32]But it's almost, the advice is kind of to strike when the iron's hot.
[86:33.86]And the iron is not only unplugged, but broken.
[86:38.52]You can't iron your clothes on YouTube anymore.
[86:40.65]This doesn't work.
[86:46.55]But, you know, it is what it is.
[86:51.73]I would say try to do something new.
[86:54.99]Try to do something different.
[86:57.13]And I don't think YouTube is the thing.
[86:58.75]And maybe if it is YouTube, maybe it's something that's not been done video-wise before.
[87:05.52]Because it is tough starting now, and it is tough getting an attraction in an audience now.
[87:09.94]Way, way harder than it was five years ago.
[87:15.01]But thank you to... Back here.
[87:25.17]MetalSan, thanks for the 25 cents.
[87:26.45]Psychologists and therapists are not just for people who want to do drastic things.
[87:30.09]We all have some critical flaws and do weird mental gymnastics, and it helps to have a third party such as a counselor or a psychiatrist who isn't just going to arbitrarily take your side to help you understand.
[87:40.52]Well, yourself.
[87:42.02]Regarding the guy earlier, it's of critical importance to find an outpatient behavior health service they can do repayment plans to.
[87:49.75]Good advice.
[87:51.84]Yeah, I've gone to the days where, I mean, having a therapist, having a psychologist or a psychiatrist is not a big deal at all.
[88:02.63]Like, that's not a big deal.
[88:04.03]Like, hey, guys, I'm trying to, like, better myself.
[88:07.35]Like, that's a good thing.
[88:08.89]That's not a bad thing.
[88:13.45]But I agree with you.
[88:16.34]Thank you, Sir Luminescence, for the $10 here.
[88:19.16]Thank you.
[88:20.30]Hey, man.
[88:20.66]Long time lover of your shenanigans.
[88:22.19]Your vids are always what I watch whenever I'm feeling down.
[88:25.01]And in the past year, I've been loving your streams, too.
[88:27.39]Don't know why it took me so long to sub, but thanks.
[88:29.79]Thanks a lot, man.
[88:31.17]Well, thank you, first of all.
[88:32.27]And second of all, no one's obligated ever to sub to the stream or give any money.
[88:38.42]There's no... You could absolutely never pay me a cent on this platform, and I would be completely fine with it.
[88:46.02]So don't worry about that.
[88:48.34]I get that comment sometimes.
[88:49.36]People are like, oh man, sorry, I haven't given any money, or I haven't given any bits, or I haven't subscribed in a while.
[88:55.83]It's like, that's totally fucking alright, man.
[88:57.87]You are free to... You do not have any obligation to pay this stream any money.
[89:05.01]What?
[89:05.25]I got threatened.
[89:08.21]what don't you dare no but thanks a lot man appreciate the 10 bucks I didn't want to oh god John arbuckle thanks for 25 cents I'm not boner blasting anybody's lasagna good that's a good thing metal sand again thanks for the 25 cents it's also worth noting that in some conditions feed into themselves
[89:29.96]when the person you talk to only knows how to give sympathy and not how to guide you through the mental labyrinth.
[89:35.14]Talking to a professional is of critical importance, and even if you don't have a lot of money, most of the medications, particularly anti-anxiety and antidepressants, are far less per month than some people would run a bar bill.
[89:47.31]Yeah, I mean, that's why I made sure to very clearly state that, that
[89:51.89]I can only, you know, obviously provide my thoughts on it.
[89:56.86]And a professional is very much well more equipped than I am to help out in those situations.
[90:04.54]So you can take some guidance or guidelines or something that I would say, but an actual professional is the one you should seek.
[90:14.59]Very good advice here from MetalSand for sure.
[90:20.53]and we have uh almost at the end here spaghetti thanks for the one dollar hey Jeremy been around your channels for a while and I love your stuff I couldn't catch the stream today but I just want to give you some love in return also my name is spy getty but it is pronounced throat wobbler man what what are you what is this throat wobbler what does that mean
[90:43.12]I'm scared to say it.
[90:44.20]Thank you Saxolot for the 25 cents.
[90:46.16]Hey, Gingivitis, when can I expect Rat Movie 3?
[90:48.52]Thanks.
[90:49.06]Snort.
[90:51.62]Thank you MetalSand again for the $1.11.
[90:54.40]As I said earlier also, I still want a new meme monster to rival Pikachu in Beanbag Sonic.
[91:00.12]We may have gotten one as Bird Knuckles.
[91:06.36]He's not red.
[91:07.58]He's a seagull.
[91:08.98]He has nothing to do with knuckles.
[91:10.11]He just kind of has big arms.
[91:12.88]Big mama thanks for the five dollars.
[91:14.42]No McRib joke this time.
[91:16.76]I'm immensely grateful I stumbled onto your TF2 videos back in the day.
[91:20.44]You're a great person and help so many people through shit.
[91:22.79]Thank you for being you.
[91:23.51]I wish you nothing but success and happiness.
[91:26.67]As I do for you.
[91:28.85]I wish you all nothing but success and happiness.
[91:31.57]I wish you all all of it.
[91:37.63]I get a lot of positivity my way on these streams.
[91:41.35]And I... Send it back to you.
[91:45.73]I hope you guys have a fucking great day.
[91:47.35]I hope you guys have a fucking fantastic next week.
[91:51.72]I hope you get everything that you want and deserve.
[91:55.56]Start the Ted Talk!
[91:56.46]Ow, fuck.
[91:58.76]But for real.
[92:00.98]Thank you so much.
[92:02.88]I wish you all nothing.
[92:03.84]No, no, that's not what I said.
[92:04.86]I said I wish you all nothing but the best and the most in life.
[92:10.00]You can't just put quotes around that.
[92:11.26]That's not what I said.
[92:14.56]And last two here.
[92:15.60]Tdogg, the man, thanks for the $1.05.
[92:17.20]Jerma, I know we make... We like to make fun of you quite a bit in chat, but I want to know... I want you to know you've really been one of the most important people in my life and many others for the past five years.
[92:29.63]Plan to try and donate more soon, but for now...
[92:32.64]I love you and give it the great work.
[92:35.36]Thank you, T-Dog.
[92:37.27]Again, no obligation to give me money ever.
[92:40.11]But thank you.
[92:41.13]I appreciate it nonetheless.
[92:44.29]World came in with $50 here.
[92:46.27]Thank you, $50 World.
[92:51.10]That's a lot of money, man.
[92:54.20]It makes me ecstatic to hear you say that and to have a chat full of support.
[92:57.34]I've been pretty stable since that hospitalization, but I continue to tune into your stream whenever I can to watch you goof around.
[93:02.90]As you still the jokester I subbed to back in 2010.
[93:06.50]I'm glad I'm in a situation where I can finally give you the support I've been wanting to for eight years.
[93:13.13]Thank you, world.
[93:16.15]Well... I am, like, just struck...
[93:24.45]I still can't believe that people would want to give me that much money.
[93:30.85]And I am more than absolutely more than happy to have a place for you to hang out and chat and talk and hang out and have fun.
[93:48.84]I wish there was more I could say and do.
[93:53.56]But
[93:54.30]just know that I fucking care you guys are all fucking awesome I would not even I would not be able to do this shit like think think about this think think think about this like really like go over this in your brain for a minute here like I'm sitting here doing streaming and youtubes and youtubes I know I just said that but
[94:20.45]Look at the amount of money that is coming in today.
[94:22.97]You guys have allowed me to do this shit.
[94:27.13]You guys are the reason why this is possible.
[94:29.75]You fucking people here gave me this opportunity.
[94:36.05]Nobody else did.
[94:37.99]It wasn't some company.
[94:39.43]It wasn't some deal that I made.
[94:41.20]No, the people that are watching right now, you've literally given me this fucking entire life.
[94:50.45]So it is of my most precedence to make sure that I do whatever I can to try to make every and any experience I possibly can fun and interesting for you.
[95:06.67]Because you fucking did it.
[95:08.18]Like, nobody else did this.
[95:12.98]And I think a lot of people lose that.
[95:14.18]A lot of people forget that.
[95:19.86]You can't.
[95:21.06]Never forget that.
[95:27.93]Whether I have 500 or 500,000 people watching a stream or a video.
[95:38.24]That's the truth, you know?
[95:41.74]But thank you so much, dude.
[95:44.34]So are you going to bring back all the dead memes for us?
[95:46.50]No.
[95:48.75]No.
[95:50.01]Yeah.
[95:52.92]But to wrap it up here, thank you Grainbender for the $1.
[95:55.60]You're the most unique streamer on the platform.
[95:58.44]We all love you.
[96:01.38]I am humbled and grounded that you would even say that in the first place.
[96:04.86]Thank you.
[96:06.64]Novi333, thanks for the $1.
[96:08.44]I wouldn't normally share this, but I was seriously suicidal a couple months ago.
[96:11.45]I started the keto diet as well as exercising more frequently, and I feel like a completely different person.
[96:17.61]I hope everyone else...
[96:19.37]That is having problems with depression in this chat.
[96:21.11]Find a way to help themselves.
[96:22.23]Godspeed, everybody.
[96:24.83]I'm glad you found a way to feel better.
[96:29.18]And a lot of times, you know, lifestyle changes can help a lot.
[96:33.14]They really can.
[96:35.42]There's no secret end-all, be-all recipe for how to get over something like depression or anxiety or stress.
[96:42.81]But it can help.
[96:44.65]It does help.

[98:17.50]I'll be... I'll be active on Twitter.
[98:19.38]If anyone's, like, looking for me, I'll be on Twitter every, like, 30, 40 minutes or so, kind of seeing what people are saying.
[98:25.07]Saturday is my actual meetup day.
[98:28.40]Try to catch me.
[98:29.14]If I don't catch you, I'm going to try to catch as many people as I can.
[98:31.98]But every year, every convention, I always miss people.
[98:35.46]And I'm sorry about that.
[98:39.22]But it's just kind of... The word I want to use here is it's very difficult to try to find everybody.
[98:49.93]Especially if people are like, hey, we're going to go over here.
[98:52.01]We're going to go this way.
[98:52.65]We're going to go that way.
[98:54.75]But I'll try as hard as I can.
[98:56.25]And right at the end here, World again gave another $40.
[99:00.08]World has given, that's like a hundred bucks now, dude.
[99:03.28]More than that now.
[99:05.34]Thank you for the $40 here at the very end.
[99:07.02]I've recently been working a pretty awful job, and I only just now got out of it.
[99:12.95]I'm back in school, and with all the free time I'm finding myself with, I'm planning to spend my streaming for myself.
[99:19.59]You're my inspiration and have always been.
[99:21.81]You're such a great person that makes me strive to be like you even more than just streaming.
[99:25.93]Cheer 4000.
[99:26.41]Thank you, dude.
[99:29.69]I wish you the best of luck.
[99:30.71]I really do.
[99:32.63]It's a wild platform.
[99:37.63]I wish you all the best, man.
[99:41.01]Streaming can be equal parts fun and equal parts frustrating because of obviously technical issues
[99:52.09]And trying to figure out what to play and what to stream, what you want to do.
[99:56.07]But it is a lot of fun.
[99:57.37]That is for certain.
[99:58.55]It's a blast.
[100:02.27]But thank you so much, dude.
[100:05.18]And with that, everybody, take care.
[100:08.16]See you all soon.
[100:09.98]See you next week.
[100:11.96]Next week is the detective stream.
[100:16.25]You'll see it.
[100:17.73]I don't know what we're going to play on Tuesday, but I know for certain that next week will be the detective stream.
[100:24.11]I probably want to do it on Friday because that's the obvious place to do it because Friday night, we can be fucking around, right?
[100:31.00]But have a good rest of your night.
[100:32.92]If you're going to PAX, have fun, be safe.
[100:34.92]I will see you on Tuesday and maybe an IRL stream over the weekend.
[100:38.10]I'm not sure.
[100:39.56]Good night.
[100:40.56]Take care.
[100:41.16]Good luck.
[100:42.58]See you soon.
[100:59.86]you
