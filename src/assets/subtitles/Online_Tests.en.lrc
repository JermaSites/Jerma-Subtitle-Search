[00:00.73]I wasn't late.
[00:02.95]I wasn't late.
[00:03.43]I started it at 2 o'clock.
[00:05.77]Sir, it was 2 2 p.m.
[00:10.49]and 42 seconds or something.
[00:15.92]He said on the dot.
[00:18.76]Right.
[00:19.14]At 2 2 0 0 it was going to start.
[00:22.06]I didn't count any seconds after that.
[00:28.40]Somebody wrote, losing interest.
[00:31.88]I already lost interest in this shit.
[00:35.38]I don't care anymore.
[00:39.06]No more quizzes, dude.
[00:40.88]I've seen enough.
[00:45.54]Where's Chubby Bunny?
[00:49.48]Chubby Bunny.
[00:51.88]Interesting concept for an activity.
[00:56.19]I will do Chubby Bunny today.
[00:59.25]Yes, it's going to happen today.
[01:00.51]That's right.
[01:04.31]But when is it going to happen?
[01:09.29]We're going to pull some American reality TV on you guys.
[01:13.96]I'm going to talk about the thing that you care about 25 times over the next few hours.
[01:21.74]And coming up soon, Chubby Bunny with Jerma.
[01:25.10]And it shows me in like this weird cube.
[01:27.60]There's a glass around it for some reason.
[01:29.66]And there's cameras all over this one like bird's eye camera.
[01:32.57]And I'm sitting there like, oh shit.
[01:38.95]After the break.
[01:40.80]And then the break comes back and they don't go to me doing Chubby Bunny.
[01:44.08]They do something else entirely for like two more hours.
[01:46.64]They do three or four more commercial breaks in that time where they show me with goggles on inside the cage, inside of the glass box.
[01:55.25]Here he comes.
[01:57.07]And don't forget, Chubby Bunny coming up with Jerma.
[02:01.01]I look into the camera.
[02:01.71]I'm like, yo, hey, you.
[02:06.00]And then it happens right before the credits roll and it sucks.
[02:11.19]Prepare yourself.
[02:13.79]It's a way to keep you here.
[02:14.65]Until I'm done.
[02:20.09]That's G4?
[02:22.98]I don't remember.
[02:25.24]But stalling.
[02:26.00]This whole stream is a stall.
[02:28.28]Don't you understand?
[02:29.14]I have 30 plus personality quizzes.
[02:32.56]And tests.
[02:34.62]And tests.
[02:37.14]And then we're going to play a Family Feud online video game.
[02:40.14]By the way, you get to participate in.
[02:41.44]What's that?
[02:41.80]Oh, can you believe that?
[02:46.82]Phylactery Lich, $50 from Phylactery.
[02:50.87]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, Phylactery.
[02:52.75]It's a huge amount of money.
[02:53.63]Put the marshmallows in your mouth before we fucking lose it.
[02:56.67]You'll see it.
[02:57.87]Hey, it's going to happen before the stream turns off.
[03:01.39]I guarantee it.
[03:07.88]And everybody thinks I'm gonna, like, die or something.
[03:10.36]I'm not gonna... Look, let me just be very, very clear.
[03:14.96]I am not going to do Chubby Bunny until I die.
[03:19.55]I know a lot of people are saying, dude, don't... Be careful.
[03:23.91]I don't care about getting the world record at Chubby Bunny.
[03:26.63]I don't care.
[03:27.71]It's a stupid activity.
[03:29.65]No one should ever fucking do it under any circumstance.
[03:32.57]Ever.
[03:33.97]I'm just gonna do it... I'm gonna do it for the photo.
[03:37.81]You know, I'll get some in there and be like, oh, look at me.
[03:39.79]And then it all comes out.
[03:47.19]No one has done this in five years.
[03:50.88]Yeah, and no one should ever do it.
[03:52.50]Full disclaimer, don't do Chubby Bunny.
[03:54.58]It's fucking stupid.
[03:56.00]It's not even fun.
[03:57.10]It sucks.
[03:57.76]It's not even funny.
[04:00.34]I just said it, and I said it out loud.
[04:02.89]I said I was going to do it because it was just a thing that I thought I was never going to have to do.
[04:06.77]But here we are.
[04:08.48]Why are you doing it then?
[04:09.52]Because I have to.
[04:11.58]I made a promise on the Mafia remake stream that if I took damage on that one mission, that I was going to have to do it.
[04:19.40]So I'm just taking it for the fucking photo, okay?
[04:23.75]Butchug stream.
[04:26.77]I'm so glad that person got instantly timed out.
[04:30.13]Hey, AdventureMFDan, thanks for the five subs and Borderlines five subs.
[04:33.29]Thanks both of you guys.
[04:36.18]Stream is not in 144p.
[04:37.71]It almost was.
[04:38.65]I almost didn't change it.
[04:39.65]Alright, without further ado, let's go.
[04:46.97]It's not 144p.
[04:49.09]It better not be.
[04:49.83]Did the settings not save?
[04:50.97]I hope they did.
[04:52.65]No, they did.
[04:54.27]At 720p, 60... Okay, good.
[04:56.73]I was about to say that's not good.
[05:00.41]Alright, hold on.
[05:01.09]I'm going!
[05:06.34]Want me to supply some lip balm?
[05:13.87]Just go, just go, just go.
[05:16.05]It's been five minutes, man.
[05:20.31]Stalling, stalling.
[05:21.37]I'm just hanging out for a second on my intro screen.
[05:25.88]We've gone over this before.
[05:27.30]We've talked about this a thousand times.
[05:29.80]How many streamers do you know that their starting soon screen is like 40 minutes?
[05:36.05]When I turn that on, I'm here in the seat.
[05:39.17]I'm ready.
[05:40.75]To stall.
[05:42.21]Actively stall.
[05:43.22]Not passively stall.
[05:44.16]You see, I'm an active staller.
[05:46.84]Not a passive staller.
[05:48.06]With a screen that's just like that for 20 minutes.
[05:52.72]When I get you here, I actively do this.
[05:59.11]You're doing that right now.
[06:00.43]No, I'm actively here.
[06:02.67]I'm not passively stalling you.
[06:09.54]Idiot streamer laughing my ass off.
[06:11.90]That's a joke.
[06:12.46]Oh, we got OSTs.
[06:14.23]Right, I got a cool OST for us to listen to.
[06:17.61]This is called Legendary Video Game Music.
[06:19.85]That's the playlist.
[06:21.99]And I have 30 plus quizzes we're going to start right now.
[06:25.94]How do we transition over there?
[06:30.14]Can you see it?
[06:31.62]Wait, I have to hide this.
[06:32.36]I don't want anyone to know what I'm doing.
[06:35.04]Gotta hide the tabs first.
[06:36.08]Oh.
[06:42.07]Shall we start the music?
[06:44.70]Oh, no.
[06:44.96]He showed his stream key.
[06:47.62]Oh, no.
[06:47.98]It was right on the Twitch dashboard.
[06:51.72]He's handsome today?
[06:55.51]I'm just going to get this out of the way.
[06:57.89]I'm going to get this out of the way.
[07:01.09]Because I know I'm going to drink out of this can.
[07:04.57]And it's going to piss off a ton of people.
[07:07.26]I got to get this out of the way.
[07:10.09]I have no affiliation with whatever this is.
[07:12.34]I just know that I'm gonna take a sip out of it and somebody's gonna say, yo, fuck you, okay?
[07:17.66]Look, I get it.
[07:18.67]It was on sale, okay?
[07:19.89]It was on sale.
[07:40.52]This is why I don't put facecam on.
[07:44.43]I don't... Videos delayed?
[07:46.03]What?
[07:48.07]It was on sale, so I got a couple.
[07:53.48]I've never... This is like the first time I've ever had this.
[07:59.28]This is not sponsored.
[08:00.68]I just bought it.
[08:01.58]I knew people were going to be pissed about this.
[08:03.89]Look.

[08:41.70]Kinda tastes like the air inside of an airplane.
[08:50.23]I think.
[08:51.90]It's like airplane air.
[08:54.68]Like, texture.
[09:03.89]It tastes like, uh...
[09:08.00]Okay, you know when you have a Jolly Rancher, and you get to the very end of the Jolly Rancher, and it's finally gone?
[09:14.19]Okay, an hour later, like, the spit and taste inside of your mouth, if you have not had any more food after that, that, like, your, like, own flavoring inside your mouth, you're, like, coating.
[09:26.78]It's like that.
[09:28.02]It's not bad.
[09:28.40]Remember, it's only two.
[09:37.44]I can't, I, what, I, am I gonna have ten of these?
[09:40.14]This is the first time I've drank alcohol in like seven months.
[09:45.94]No, this is the third time I've drank alcohol since February.
[09:49.83]Where the fuck am I going?
[09:52.39]I ain't going anywhere.
[09:55.59]Where do I have to go?
[09:56.59]I'm not going anywhere.
[09:58.27]I can't have a, I can't have a fucking airplane, air, drink?
[10:05.80]I can't have one?
[10:08.00]In seven months?
[10:23.49]You know, alright.
[10:24.35]Like, I kind of feel like, alright.
[10:26.23]This feels like I should have, like... Did I contact somebody?
[10:31.96]Hey!
[10:34.36]There it is.
[10:35.80]Jerma 885's drink of choice.
[10:39.40]It's not this.
[10:42.32]It's not this.
[10:43.76]But he'll drink it if he wants to.
[10:45.66]If he thinks it's okay.
[10:48.52]It's pretty good.
[10:49.78]I think it's okay.
[10:51.98]I think it's okay.
[10:56.56]Don't drink it.
[10:57.10]Alright, we're going to start with my mental age.
[10:59.04]We've got to go.
[11:00.26]There's like 40 of these.
[11:04.38]Thank you, Nidhogg, for the five community subs.
[11:09.01]I had to get that out of the way.
[11:09.85]I know people are going to freak the fuck out.
[11:12.11]Like, if I didn't say anything about this and you saw that lettering, you'd be like, fuck this guy.
[11:17.64]Now I give you like a 15 minute excuse as to why I'm drinking it in the first place.
[11:21.96]Can't have one.
[11:22.68]Okay, let's start.
[11:23.48]This determines how old I am mentally.
[11:27.13]I guess.
[11:29.77]Okay, question one of 20.
[11:30.59]The whole page is an ad?
[11:38.82]Okay, Twitter is confusing... Get that fucking... I don't get that out of here.
[11:48.70]Oh, the music!
[11:54.25]Ah.
[11:56.37]That's better.
[11:59.23]Okay, Twitter is confusing, essential, pointless, annoying, it wakes me up in the morning...
[12:08.65]It's fucking pointless.
[12:12.09]You find an old shirt in the wardrobe.
[12:13.73]You... I can't believe you ever wore that and throw it out.
[12:21.09]You keep it for decorating.
[12:23.45]You consider giving it to charity.
[12:25.75]You put it on.
[12:26.59]You wonder how you ever managed to fit in it.
[12:29.26]What's a wardrobe?
[12:31.46]Give it to charity.
[12:34.66]I would have given it to charity well before this.
[12:37.78]Anytime I get new clothes, I usually do like a charity thing.
[12:42.48]Where it's like, okay, what do I wear?
[12:43.44]Do I wear that?
[12:44.00]I don't.
[12:44.50]Charity.
[12:45.69]The don't wear pile goes charity.
[12:49.31]Charity.
[12:52.65]You're planning a house party.
[12:54.21]You bring the white claw.
[12:57.51]Think about telling your neighbors.
[12:59.43]Make sure you got enough chairs.
[13:00.57]Find out where the cheapest vodka is.
[13:04.03]Plan which games to play.
[13:08.19]I would not invite my neighbors to a party.
[13:12.85]That's mental age of like 80.
[13:16.33]Nobody talks to their neighbors anymore.
[13:19.17]Back in like the day, it was always like, oh, you need some sugar?
[13:21.65]Hey, it's me, Dave, from right next door.
[13:24.12]I'm knocking on your fucking door.
[13:25.58]Can I have stuff?
[13:26.66]That doesn't happen anymore.
[13:29.81]I would not invite a neighbor to a party.
[13:32.33]In fact, if my neighbor knocked on my door, I'd be like, get away from me.
[13:37.20]I don't know who you are.
[13:38.12]Believe me alone.
[13:39.60]And then I would slam the big slider shut.
[13:43.68]You're not getting into Oz.
[13:46.72]What is the question?
[13:50.11]I would make sure I had a... No, that's gross.
[13:52.21]You're going to serve the gross shit to your friends?
[13:56.21]The cheap shit to your friends?
[13:58.19]I've got a better idea.
[14:03.34]You should serve them.
[14:06.58]High quality red wine.
[14:10.15]Like a Malbec.
[14:10.63]How about this?
[14:13.69]How about this?
[14:15.13]You drink this in your house.
[14:16.67]Nobody knows you're there.
[14:17.29]I always make sure I have enough chairs for people to sit down.
[14:23.74]Baseball caps look better forwards.
[14:25.90]I don't like wearing the cap backwards.
[14:28.10]It hurts my head.
[14:30.12]It's hot and you want an ice cream.
[14:31.40]You buy...
[14:37.28]It's hot.
[14:37.84]You want an ice cream.
[14:38.55]You buy a Magnum.
[14:41.71]Why would you buy a Magnum if you wanted to have an ice cream?
[14:48.31]How does this game work?
[14:50.79]I would buy a cone with chocolate flake.
[14:55.81]These feel like AI.
[14:56.57]Is this AI generated?
[15:00.84]I bought a chocolate ice cream.
[15:02.02]I don't know, whatever the fuck that is.
[15:03.96]McDonald's is a good place to meet.
[15:07.42]Oh, I fucking am mad about this.
[15:14.33]Alrighty then.
[15:17.23]That's the only thing I can think of when I hear this song.
[15:21.21]Ace Ventura 2.
[15:23.79]I can never enjoy this Halo theme song.
[15:27.18]Okay, a good place to meet.
[15:28.20]McDonald's is okay for a quick snack.
[15:30.22]Yeah.
[15:31.20]It's not disgusting, please.
[15:32.40]Uh, the current prime minister president looks... Too young.
[15:38.31]No.
[15:39.55]Okay.
[15:42.49]They're all old.
[15:43.27]They're all... He's like 75.
[15:45.89]He's old.
[15:48.21]He's not even a prime minister.
[15:49.25]This is a UK question.
[15:51.71]You think a pension plan is...
[15:55.42]Not what you thought it would be.
[15:56.67]Important or something worth considering.
[15:58.99]Something for later.
[15:59.85]I feel like these are all the same answer.
[16:06.53]I feel like that's something to consider.
[16:10.63]Life is fun.
[16:12.87]Sure.
[16:13.39]It sure is.
[16:14.93]You get passed on the motorway by a Ferrari.
[16:18.16]How fast?
[16:19.58]You think, sweet.
[16:21.50]I bet that driver is a wanker.
[16:24.26]They'll not get there any quicker.
[16:25.52]Fuck.
[16:50.64]It's cold in here!
[17:04.96]Where's Avenger?

[18:58.15]That's weird.
[18:59.29]Order coffee sometimes.
[19:00.41]Empty the tray into the bin.
[19:04.21]What do you mean?
[19:05.25]Where are we?
[19:07.37]Finish your meal in a restaurant?
[19:10.19]Are we at like a fucking In-N-Out or are we at a fine dining restaurant?
[19:13.95]Imagine like dumping your tray at like a fine dining establishment.
[19:20.92]Ask whether the tip is included.
[19:22.84]Excuse me, excuse me.
[19:25.72]If you guys do gratuity included, I don't feel like adding any more.
[19:29.42]So actually, you know what?
[19:31.14]Sometimes I wish they would just do that.
[19:34.39]I wish the waiter or waitress, when you were done at your meal, they would walk up and say, hey, thank you for eating here.
[19:42.98]Is it okay for us to put a 20% gratuity on top?
[19:46.00]Like, and that's it, and you can leave.
[19:47.02]Yeah.

[20:32.48]I'm not doing a political compass on stream.
[20:35.76]No.

[20:43.68]Like, 200 volts.
[20:46.44]Like... Like, in the chair.
[20:49.77]Would that kill you?

[21:30.26]You guys don't even know, that's like my game right now.
[21:34.40]No, this is a good one.
[21:36.75]Dire Straits were air guitar heaven hoo cheesy.
[21:40.63]Not like today's musicians, they could actually play.
[21:50.34]I actually don't know who this is.
[21:54.26]Why do I not know who this is?
[21:56.32]It's weird.
[22:00.38]I don't know.
[22:00.86]I really don't.
[22:02.03]If you presented to me a song, I'd probably be like, oh, right, right, right.
[22:05.89]Birthdays are a time to meet the family, a time to get wasted, a time for presents, something to ignore.
[22:10.51]Right.
[22:10.81]I'm 35.
[22:10.97]I don't care.
[22:12.91]Wake me up when I'm 50.
[22:15.50]The best way to become rich is to win the lottery, to work hard, to become a footballer.
[22:19.48]Get lucky.
[22:29.16]It's all about getting struck by lightning five times.
[22:32.52]What's the matter, Otto?
[22:34.64]Hold on.
[22:35.10]Cam going off.
[22:35.78]Dog wants to leave.
[22:55.64]No pants?
[22:58.02]This guy.
[22:59.48]This guy, Jerma985.
[23:00.30]Okay, so you see someone fall over in the street, you laugh.
[23:09.64]Run over and make sure they're okay.
[23:10.80]Thank the heavens it wasn't you.
[23:12.66]Shake your head and think, Muppet.
[23:18.56]How far away am I?
[23:24.40]Okay, am I more than 100 feet away?
[23:28.97]Because it would be like, thank God that wasn't me.
[23:31.99]Am I within, like, 25 feet?
[23:36.33]Like, within 25 feet.
[23:38.05]Okay, I'd probably be like, hey, you good?
[23:39.87]You okay?
[23:41.82]The best thing on TV is The Big Bang Theory.
[23:43.66]Nope.
[23:43.90]The Simpsons.
[23:44.44]Family Guy.
[23:44.86]Nope.
[23:45.16]Love Island.
[23:45.70]X-Factor.
[23:46.10]Nope.
[23:46.36]Nature Documentaries.
[23:47.12]Nope.
[23:47.30]There's nothing on TV that's any good besides the boys.
[23:50.26]Check that out if I were you.
[23:52.58]Okay, Miley Cyrus is, like, so over...
[24:01.20]I don't know.
[24:03.50]Miley Cyrus is not really, what was the last album?
[24:09.22]I haven't heard, I haven't really heard Miley Cyrus in a while.
[24:12.58]2015, right?
[24:15.89]Probably like, yeah, it's not, probably moving on to do other things.
[24:18.57]24.
[24:22.31]Hey, 24.
[24:28.94]This highly accurate age test has looked at your answers and evaluated that your mental age is 24.
[24:32.46]The test looks at your answers to the questions in relation to your attitude towards social and financial situations.
[24:38.68]These were just, like, mean questions.
[24:42.40]It's quite possible that you will not be happy with your age test result.
[24:44.66]If you're younger, you probably don't want to have an age that makes you look older.
[24:48.06]If you are older, then you don't want to have the mental age of a youngster.
[24:52.14]Such, unfortunately, is life.
[24:53.58]You have to roll with the person you are and accept your personality.
[24:57.85]Some interesting stats for those that are interested in these things.
[25:00.29]68% of people that take this test have a mental age of less than 30.
[25:02.73]This might be that 68% of people that take the test are less than 30, but it's very high age average.
[25:11.92]Here at MMA, we think it's more likely that people have a youthful attitude in life.
[25:17.54]I thought that's our jump child.
[25:21.77]Okay, if you can like, if you can order drinks at a bar...
[25:26.43]three times over.
[25:29.95]That's three times over.
[25:31.47]You can order drinks at a bar.
[25:40.82]Yeah, that means like 21, 22, 23, 24.
[25:43.80]It don't matter no more.
[25:45.12]You just hang out.
[25:50.04]People get grumpier as they get older.
[25:51.66]Kind of.
[25:56.28]Kinda.
[25:56.62]Alright, my mental age is 24.
[25:58.24]Okay, cool.
[25:59.50]What's the next one?
[26:01.32]Alright, this is like a test to see if I have a color imbalance or something in my brain.
[26:05.83]Alright, this is the color challenge.
[26:09.01]Okay, the first and last colored chips are fixed.
[26:14.61]Okay.
[26:15.69]Drag and drop the colors in each row to arrange them by hue color.
[26:18.84]Complete all four color tests.
[26:21.54]My color IQ.
[26:22.50]Alright, sure.
[26:25.19]So, just in shade?
[26:27.53]I can do this.
[26:28.17]I've got a pretty good eye.
[26:29.47]We're going pink to orange.
[26:39.61]Nobody say anything yet.
[26:40.49]I haven't done it yet.
[26:43.47]Already a negative IQ.
[26:45.78]We're going pink to orange.
[26:48.20]That's green.
[26:51.02]I already took the Myers-Briggs personality test.
[26:54.18]I got ENFP.
[26:56.00]Like 10 years ago.
[26:57.22]I did it on stream too, didn't I?
[26:58.32]Alright, I'm not done.
[27:08.15]No, that's not right.
[27:08.79]Okay.
[27:25.13]Okay.
[27:27.16]I think that's it.
[27:34.56]Do it!
[27:35.02]Alright, that one's good.
[27:36.62]So we're going green to blue.
[27:37.70]This is really not, this is not hard.
[27:44.35]Why is this so hard?
[27:47.59]Wait, people can't do, what, what, what, is this difficult?
[27:53.39]This is ma- bad monitor.
[27:55.53]Do I have a shitty monitor?
[27:56.77]It actually gets a little harder on this next one.
[28:07.64]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:19.72]That's close, but wait.
[28:26.91]This one's kind of freaking me out.
[28:28.13]I don't like this one.
[28:29.35]That's wrong, isn't it?
[28:30.03]I got it.
[28:33.81]That's right.
[28:36.27]No, it's not.
[28:39.03]Alright, that one's correct.
[28:43.12]This is blue to purple.
[28:44.00]Alright, we gotta go shit.
[28:49.26]Because the ones on the left and right are fixed.
[28:50.76]I can't move them.
[28:53.58]Eyes of a 24-year-old.
[28:55.93]Dude, the white balance on my camera is fucking fucked up.
[28:58.77]Okay?
[28:59.47]That's the real color imbalance here.
[29:02.24]Hold on.
[29:14.97]Okay, there.
[29:22.89]You look pink.
[29:25.11]Let me just hold my face up there.
[29:27.08]Come on, bro!
[29:27.80]I'm, I'm, hold on!
[29:29.14]Alright, that's, this is close enough.
[29:39.44]I don't even care if I get this wrong.
[29:44.12]I don't care.
[29:44.68]What, I can't, I can't put, like, colored cubes together?
[29:47.48]Who cares?
[29:48.72]I can do this some other time.
[29:54.22]No, this would be accurate.
[29:58.52]Alright, purple back here.
[29:59.70]Do it by... Go left to right.
[30:05.06]That's done.
[30:06.12]Right?
[30:06.73]Yeah, that was easy.
[30:07.37]Alright, this one's going to be the hard one.
[30:11.77]Why are you giving that much money?
[30:15.91]Let's get 50 community subs.
[30:18.95]Ready Dread with the 50 subs.
[30:21.56]Holy shit!
[30:23.79]That's a lot of fucking money.
[30:24.89]Freddy Dredd, resident billionaire.
[30:28.17]Gives like $3,000 to this stream every few months.
[30:33.19]Maniac.
[30:35.11]Hey.
[30:36.33]Cheers to that.
[30:41.45]That's a huge amount of money.
[30:42.45]Thank you.
[30:43.53]Alright, let me finish this.
[30:50.06]I'm almost there.
[30:50.64]Done.
[30:54.00]Why does that look wrong?
[30:59.21]That looks wrong, though.
[31:00.05]But it's not.
[31:01.45]Alright, I'm done.
[31:01.93]Score my test.
[31:04.29]Two?
[31:04.55]Okay, that scared me.
[31:07.19]I thought that was very bad.
[31:08.17]A lower score is better with zero being a perfect score.
[31:11.80]The circle graph displays the regions of the color spectrum where your hue discrimination is low.
[31:20.46]does that mean I can't differentiate like blues means I suck at blue so what's a high what's the high end there compare age best score for your gender is nine nine nine nine what score worst score a hundred and six would somebody just put a I how do I read this
[31:52.73]I don't know how to read that.
[31:53.57]I don't know what this data is telling me.
[31:59.49]Act.
[32:06.20]Okay.
[32:07.36]That's my color hue.
[32:08.52]70 IQ.
[32:11.64]Don't worry.
[32:12.80]Alright, next.
[32:14.82]I was told to do these.
[32:16.94]This is human benchmarking.
[32:21.53]Alright, let's do this one.
[32:22.31]I don't know what this means.
[32:26.48]Classic coming up.
[32:27.18]Alright, are you smarter than a chimpanzee?
[32:30.26]Click the squares in order according to their numbers.
[32:32.66]The test will get progressively harder.
[32:36.46]Am I smarter than a chimpanzee?
[32:38.00]Click the squares in order according to their numbers.
[32:43.30]1, 2, 3, 4.
[32:43.46]Okay.
[32:43.98]How does this get harder?
[32:47.16]Why does it get harder?
[32:49.19]One?
[32:49.83]Oh, fuck.
[32:51.09]I didn't know that's what happened.
[32:52.01]Okay, I gotta... One, two, three, four.
[33:03.08]Okay, one.
[33:12.01]Champagne Z is done.
[33:13.25]Champagne Z lost in round two.
[33:19.91]1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
[33:55.85]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[33:59.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[34:02.53]Fucking Mario in the background.
[34:04.65]Okay, the Super Mario song is fucking me up.
[34:17.80]Get the fuck out of here.
[34:37.79]Alright, what's the score then?
[34:39.27]What did I get?
[34:42.07]Save the score.
[34:42.67]What does that mean?
[34:47.21]Percentile.
[34:52.22]What does 17 percentile mean?
[34:54.46]Does that mean that I'm like really smart?
[34:59.54]Only 17% of people got as far as I did.
[35:02.26]That's top 17%.
[35:03.62]That's pretty good.
[35:05.84]What's wrong with that?
[35:10.47]Okay, aim trainer.
[35:13.41]Hit 30 targets as quickly as you can.
[35:15.49]Click the targets above to begin.
[35:16.69]Okay.
[35:19.55]This is messing with my concentration.
[35:22.21]It's like showing me colors and stuff.
[35:23.48]Okay, shoot the targets.
[35:24.78]Let me tell you, my DPI is wrong.
[35:42.29]520 milliseconds, let's see.
[35:47.88]I'm better than 70% of all gamers.
[35:49.78]That's bad.
[35:54.06]How is that bad?
[35:56.56]Who takes these quizzes?
[35:59.33]Like, you guys.
[36:01.85]Who takes these tests?
[36:03.07]Besides gamers and computer enthusiasts.
[36:06.15]My parents didn't take this.
[36:12.10]It's bottom 30%.
[36:13.26]You're looking at it wrong.
[36:18.76]You're reading it wrong.
[36:22.65]That means I'm in the bottom 30 percentile.
[36:44.24]I don't care about Facebook.
[36:47.12]Okay.
[36:50.47]Anyways.
[36:50.77]Uh, hearing.
[36:53.49]Oh, I gotta turn my volume up for this one.
[36:55.17]I got good ears.
[36:57.13]You know why I have such good ears?
[36:58.17]Because I never have loud sounds in my head.
[37:00.95]Ever.
[37:01.45]I don't listen to music.
[37:02.89]I don't go to concerts.
[37:04.71]I don't talk very loudly, unless I'm in an environment where I'm a twitch.tv/Jerma985 live streamer.
[37:10.67]I'm going to get this one pretty good.
[37:11.66]Trust me, I have weird superhuman fucking hearing.
[37:14.32]I swear to God, I'm turning the volume up for this one.
[37:17.38]I'm going to be in like the top 90%.
[37:19.08]I swear to God.
[37:20.32]Trust me.
[37:20.98]You want to see?
[37:21.56]I'll prove that the game reward went away.
[37:22.82]Look at that.
[37:26.80]There's just a little bit of some scar tissue.
[37:28.56]It'll heal over nicely.
[37:29.52]It's gone.
[37:34.08]Okay, this is- what is this?
[37:35.12]Okay.
[37:36.83]I can't have Kingdom Hearts music be playing while I'm taking a hearing test.
[37:40.37]That's fucking stupid.
[37:41.47]Okay, here we go.
[37:45.13]A high frequency sound will play.
[37:46.63]Click as soon as you hear the sound.
[37:56.87]I heard it.
[37:57.53]That hurt so bad.
[38:00.05]I already heard it.
[38:01.83]That, like, hurt my head.
[38:04.01]I could hear it already.
[38:05.00]I heard it immediately.
[38:08.90]I heard... I heard that, like, immediately.
[38:11.52]What do I mean, liar?
[38:18.99]It was like... I was like, what am I trying to wait for?
[38:24.57]Look, I was even, I didn't even understand how the game worked and I'm better than 60% of all you fucking plebs.
[38:33.37]Oh, that one hurt?
[38:33.91]I don't want to do that one again.
[38:35.63]Typing.
[38:36.05]Uh-oh.
[39:23.67]Why is it pulled up in one of the loafers?
[39:29.03]At the corner.
[39:39.54]To open the door in the hope of earning a copper.
[39:48.08]Just needed a little minute to warm up there.
[39:49.51]Okay.
[39:50.45]But was it elbowed away by another loafer?
[39:59.04]who had rushed up with the same intention.
[40:06.87]A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased.
[40:11.89]How do you spell that?
[40:21.74]By the two guardsmen.
[40:26.29]I'm reading the actual Kingdom Hearts storyline.
[40:29.78]Who took sides with one of the loungers.
[40:40.38]And by the scissors grinder who was not equally hot upon the other side.
[40:51.75]Might as well be.
[40:55.29]who was equally upon the other side.
[41:01.27]44 fucking words in a minute.
[41:11.86]Wait, what does that mean?
[41:17.78]Are you sure I'm reading this wrong?
[41:18.93]Okay, my head still hurts from the hearing test.
[41:21.11]Is that odd?
[41:22.65]I feel like I just permanently caused problems for myself.
[41:27.25]That means I'm better than 50% of everybody.
[41:30.09]Look at the stats.
[41:31.41]Oh, okay, hold on.
[41:35.35]Average user.
[41:37.85]Oh, dude, I'm fucking... Look at this.
[41:40.58]I'm right at the beginning of the curve.
[41:43.26]I sold at the right time.
[41:44.56]See, the people here... You're not gonna sell.
[41:48.78]You're gonna hold it.
[41:49.32]It's gonna get to here and you're gonna be like, fuck, maybe I should get out.
[41:53.32]That's the perfect place to be.
[42:01.16]So what about the other ones?
[42:07.60]I don't want to give it away, but I have to.
[42:09.04]Nobody look at the top.
[42:10.20]Nobody look at the top.
[42:11.76]Don't look at the top.
[42:14.47]Don't look up there.
[42:18.67]Okay, what about this one?
[42:20.77]Earring.
[42:21.41]Okay, typing.
[42:23.95]Really?
[42:24.25]I feel like that was dog shit.
[42:34.34]Actually, that's very average.
[42:36.08]I feel like that was terrible.
[42:40.97]Okay.
[42:44.91]And what about aim trainer?
[42:49.45]Look at.
[42:51.41]I'm in like the top percentile here.
[42:53.23]Alright.
[42:57.16]What about the chimp test?
[43:00.86]That's average.
[43:01.46]That's alright.
[43:05.16]Alright, let's do verbal memory.
[43:06.24]We'll do this one.
[43:11.97]Smash Brothers, alright.
[43:12.75]Alright, we're gonna do verbal memory.
[43:18.53]You will be shown words one at a time.
[43:19.99]If you've seen a word during the test, click seen.
[43:22.05]If it's a new word, click new.
[43:23.89]Actually, the music will help for this one.
[43:28.24]If you've seen a word during the test, say saw it already.
[43:32.54]If it's a new word, click new.
[43:55.13]I thought that said might-
[45:03.83]But that's a that's a trumpet that's not a guitar that's good
[45:12.98]Alright, number memory.
[45:14.58]That's my best one.
[45:15.34]I got the best verbal memory in the world.
[45:17.08]I have so many vocabulary words up here.
[45:19.70]He's inhuman.
[45:23.18]And all of a sudden you see my eyes just go like... And then somebody goes, I knew, I knew all along he was an alien.
[45:33.19]And then there's like a thousand Reddit posts about how fucking actually I'm like a CIA project or something.
[45:37.29]Let's just do that one day.
[45:45.03]I really should set up, like, an elaborate thing where, like, my eyes actually go like, and I just don't even mention it.
[45:52.17]What a way to game Reddit posts.
[45:55.09]Okay, number memory.
[45:55.89]Let's go.
[45:57.27]The average person can remember seven numbers at once.
[45:59.39]Can you do more?
[46:00.39]With Smash Brothers, I could probably do way more.
[46:06.26]How many numbers can you remember?
[46:07.26]Here we go.
[46:09.38]Two.
[46:13.96]Here we go.
[46:19.16]34.
[46:22.56]Already smarter than the 5th grader.
[46:23.80]925.
[46:25.57]I'm gonna kill this, by the way.
[46:39.92]I'm gonna shut the fuck up and lean back.
[46:51.54]Just get the shit out of me.
[47:03.01]No, no, get it off.
[47:04.37]Get it off.
[47:04.73]I don't like this one.
[47:07.53]Okay.
[47:58.43]I had it.
[47:58.93]I fucking had it.
[48:01.17]This is straight-forward music.
[48:02.09]It's too upbeat.
[48:02.73]I need, like, I need, like, like, uh, what?
[48:06.27]Winston Churchill?
[48:08.91]What's happening?
[48:09.41]Where was I?
[48:10.05]Where was I?
[48:10.77]But there could only be one winner.

[75:16.22]All my pores.
[75:17.10]There's oil and shit coming out of my knees.
[75:19.56]I have, like, watery knees.
[75:21.54]Why do you think I take that many baths?
[75:27.28]Okay.
[75:28.34]I'm indulging you.
[75:31.69]I mean, I'm pretty... This is 50-50.
[75:37.65]I could not be left alone.
[75:38.85]If I was left alone for more than a day, I would lose my fucking mind.
[75:42.97]Like, if I didn't, like, if I didn't stream or something, if I was alone, no.
[75:49.82]I have to, I have to talk to, I have to talk to somebody.
[75:53.42]Have to.
[75:56.64]Me and my watery knees, yeah.
[76:00.66]Oh, we're doing that one again.
[76:04.36]Way to go.
[76:06.95]We're doing that one again, encore.
[76:07.97]Okay, I thought the mouse was a bug on my other monitor as I was moving it around.
[76:21.61]Because the preview's over here.
[76:24.43]And I thought it was a bug.
[76:25.29]I was like, there's a fucking bug in here.
[76:28.61]I'm a pretty lenient guy.
[76:32.72]Deep or shallow.
[76:39.10]Shallow?

[77:09.35]I might be pretty poisonous.
[77:10.54]I don't know.
[77:13.96]I'm not toxic, but I might be poisonous.
[77:17.00]Okay, just because somebody is poisonous doesn't mean that they're like a toxic person, right?
[77:23.62]Like a tree frog is poisonous, but they're not toxic.
[77:26.80]They're not like calling you names and shit when you walk by them in the tree.
[77:31.20]You just don't touch them or you're fucking done.
[77:39.23]Last question.
[77:43.39]I'm pretty bossy.

[84:48.87]Okay, look at this guy.
[84:51.88]I mean, if you had been like Tommy Wiseau or something, I would have like thrown this stack of fucking papers at you and hopefully would have hit you in the face.
[84:59.30]Yeah, that'd be fucking weird, wouldn't it?
[85:01.66]Captain America here, only Captain America and Spider-Man and Tony Stark and Jim from The Office.
[85:11.91]I want to go back to the top for a second.
[85:21.75]It's your top five.
[85:22.49]Anything over 80% is like you can't.
[85:24.01]You can't.

[85:33.60]Johnny from the fucking room.

[86:10.97]Framer is pretty solid.
[86:13.59]I mean, maybe I move around kind of weird, I guess.
[86:17.35]Anyways, uh, we're gonna move on.
[86:18.69]That's Tommy Wiseau, like, uh, and even the, like, that, why that image?
[86:21.94]You couldn't have, like, a, like a, like a, like a more attractive picture of Tommy Wiseau, like, looking and smiling into the camera?
[86:26.62]Move on.
[86:30.52]What's next?
[86:32.35]I have to do this.
[86:32.85]I have to get this out of the way, because this was recommended, and I'm just gonna do it, because, like, fucking might as well, like, put myself up.
[86:38.05]That's, like, a big target for people to throw onions at and tomatoes.
[86:41.27]Here we go.
[86:43.63]Uh, I am 35 years and one month old.
[86:50.41]My height is five...
[87:08.00]That's okay.
[87:09.20]I am 23% taller than 22 men on this planet.
[87:17.11]Top 78%.
[87:18.73]Timing on that music.
[87:22.03]Sad music, sad music, sad music.
[87:23.93]I'll make it low.
[87:29.89]Just out of curiosity.
[87:35.98]What the fuck?
[87:36.80]No way!
[87:41.00]If you're 6 feet tall, you're taller than 80% of the fucking population?
[87:45.94]No, it didn't update.
[87:52.64]What?!
[87:56.38]So wait, what about 5'11"?
[87:57.95]Hold on, 5'11".
[88:03.83]I feel like that's... I think this is wrong.
[88:06.17]Is this accurate?
[88:09.28]Whatever.
[88:09.76]I'm taller than 22% of every male.
[88:13.00]I feel like this music's mocking me right now.
[88:14.68]I gotta get rid of it.
[88:16.42]Anyway, that's better.
[88:16.98]Donkey Kong.
[88:19.98]Okay, uh, this is what animal are you?
[88:25.50]Really just sticking the nail in here.
[88:28.08]Right after the other.
[88:35.03]This is not even music.
[88:37.15]No, that's too, too, too crazy.
[88:39.27]Too crazy.
[88:42.57]Yeah, sure.
[88:43.09]I like this.
[88:43.69]This is good.
[88:44.90]Okay, how big are you?
[88:46.18]I am not petite.
[88:48.18]If I was petite, guys, I'd be like 5'2".
[88:49.78]Okay, 5'7 to 5'8 is not petite.
[88:54.22]It's small, but I'm sturdy.
[88:55.66]I got fucking pants on, right?
[89:00.38]You know what I mean?
[89:02.37]This is a sturdy fucking man.
[89:05.19]Understand?
[89:05.61]Like, I'm a sturdy fucking guy.
[89:12.79]You know?
[89:15.47]I'm like a kind of a stack of shit.
[89:21.49]How aggressive are you?
[89:24.04]Jesus Christ.
[89:25.58]I'm very forceful.
[89:26.64]Don't mess with me.
[89:27.28]I'm a little hot-headed.
[89:27.98]I'm working on it.
[89:29.38]I take a middle ground and only react aggressively when the situation calls for it.
[89:33.90]I never go looking for trouble, but I'm no pushover.
[89:39.46]I think I- I'm- I- I'm pretty grounded.
[89:43.19]If I need to.
[89:47.59]I di- Move the mic.
[89:55.50]See how fucking fast that was?
[89:56.66]My headphones flew out of my ears.
[90:03.91]Now, imagine you were like coming at me.
[90:07.31]I'd be right in the neck, right in the throat, and you'd be like... How social... That's what you're gonna show for social?
[90:20.37]Is two parents, like, making out?
[90:30.02]I prefer the company.
[90:30.82]I'm pretty outgoing and I'm comfortable socializing with groups of all size.
[90:33.48]I'm extremely outgoing in function and all.
[90:34.76]Yeah, I can function anywhere.
[90:35.96]Get me anywhere.
[90:36.70]Show me up at your party, your birthday, concert, crowd, group, small group, one person.
[90:43.01]I can do it.
[90:43.49]I can do it all.
[90:44.89]How attractive do you think you are?
[90:53.48]Okay, off stream, I click this one.
[90:55.94]On stream, I click this one to make you not think I'm a fucking psycho.
[90:58.80]You know what I mean?
[91:02.13]Off stream, I would... Yeah, that's me.
[91:04.03]Off... On stream... Hey, guys.
[91:10.59]What do you think?
[91:13.76]Am I above average?
[91:18.28]You sure?
[91:25.25]No, that's like better for some of you.
[91:26.75]That like, oh yeah, do that again.
[91:28.43]Fine.
[91:34.81]Oh no, I've messed it all up.
[91:35.96]It took me an hour to get this right.
[91:38.88]There we go.
[91:47.36]I'm not as creative as a monkey playing a guitar, I don't think.
[91:51.96]I'm not one for writing songs, or I don't color within the lines.
[91:55.68]Oh, you do?
[91:56.12]Oh, I don't.
[91:58.20]I'm definitely an out-of-the-box creature, and I love creating in all of its forms.
[92:02.00]It's the same jokes?
[92:03.52]Well, it's the same test.
[92:06.74]I'm very compassionate and usually put the needs of friends and family above my own.
[92:10.28]I'm cooperative and willing to help friends in need, but I have my own life too.
[92:14.52]Someone has to look up for number one, call me selfish.
[92:16.56]No, this one.
[92:18.91]Why is it all monkeys?
[92:22.27]How intelligent are you?
[92:23.23]I have a bit of a nerd streak, and I love intellectual challenges.
[92:26.05]I'd score pretty high on... Leopardy.
[92:32.06]Uh, that's an L, that's not a J. That's very clear, that's... That's an L. Louder!
[92:42.57]Why is it getting... Why is the Minecraft music getting closer?
[92:45.73]It's like... I'm getting closer, motherfucker.
[92:49.54]I'm coming in your... I'm coming in your ears right now.
[92:51.88]You better be ready for me.
[92:55.92]It's mad.
[92:57.70]Now you've made me mess up my hairstyle.
[93:01.18]It looked fine, and now I looked crazed.
[93:04.19]Okay, that's better.
[93:09.43]Okay, we're good.
[93:11.41]Ah...
[93:13.67]I'm not the brightest crayon in the box, but I'm not a fool.
[93:16.95]How athletic are you?
[93:20.65]Not anymore.
[93:22.15]Travel and exploration.
[93:23.16]How do you feel about traveling?
[93:24.86]I'm a homebody and enjoy staying close to home.
[93:27.52]I enjoy... I don't want to travel everywhere.
[93:30.30]I'm not one of those people.
[93:32.96]I don't want to go see the world.
[93:35.82]I don't know.
[93:36.42]There's like three places I really want to see.
[93:37.94]I don't really care.
[93:41.19]But I'm not, I like to do things where I am.
[93:44.31]Right?
[93:44.97]I love going out and doing shit all the time.
[93:46.56]Like, I love going out in my area, but I don't want to get in, like, pack a bag and go to fucking London or something.
[93:53.22]Yeah.
[93:53.36]Alright, how impulsive are you?
[93:58.33]Where?
[93:58.55]I mean, I live in Las Vegas, man.
[94:02.49]Where do you want me to go?
[94:05.27]Okay, how impulsive?
[94:06.13]I'm always deliberate and cautious.
[94:07.75]I admit that I'm more impulsive than I should be, but it makes for great... I thought that was going to say great content.
[94:15.15]Alright, what animal?
[94:25.43]What animal?
[94:32.20]What animal am I?
[94:32.86]I don't want to open this.
[94:37.78]What's going on?
[94:38.28]I just heard an animal.
[95:02.11]I just heard an animal.
[95:03.65]I just heard like an animal yelling.
[95:08.25]I think that was auto.
[95:09.09]Okay, this page won't even load.
[95:13.28]Why won't this page load?
[95:19.80]Did you guys crash the website?
[95:22.10]You had too many people to do this.
[95:29.19]Wait!
[95:31.77]Okay, I got... Speedrun.
[95:40.55]STOP OPENING THIS WEBSITE!
[95:45.97]Uh... I'm... gotta get out of the box.
[95:50.04]Cooperative.
[95:51.66]I may not be the brightest, but I'm not a fool.
[95:54.68]I like to keep fit.
[95:56.82]I watch TV.
[95:57.72]Does that count?
[96:00.07]I like to go on day trips.
[96:03.05]Okay, now we're getting to the good shit.
[96:04.53]Alright, now... I'm impulsive.
[96:07.53]What's the animal?
[96:18.11]Anybody want a gift card?
[96:19.03]Oh, that's bullshit.
[96:32.23]Which Neopet are you?
[96:34.69]Same with the animal theme here.
[96:40.08]Okay, uh, you boy or girl?
[96:41.90]Boy, I say it's your last day in Neopia ever.
[96:44.60]What do you do?
[96:45.44]I don't know what any of these are.
[96:50.74]Play Tombola, Neomail all of your friends, sell all of your stuff, collect your bank interest, or cry and wave goodbye to your Neopets.
[97:02.49]I probably- Is this my last day in Neopetopia?
[97:06.67]I'd cry and say bye to my Neopets.
[97:10.71]Pick an item, any item.
[97:11.75]Beef Ruladin, Laugh Grenade, I mean, do I have to do anything else?
[97:16.19]I don't have to click anything else.
[97:17.79]When you read the Neopian Times, which section do you click first?
[97:21.73]Comics?
[97:22.63]Funnies?
[97:24.79]Who would you pick first to be on your team?
[97:29.67]Dr. Death.
[97:31.53]If you were going to start a guild, where would you put it?
[97:34.56]At the, uh, the Lenny Library.
[97:40.98]If a war were to break out in Neofio, which would you be?
[97:44.29]A minion of sloth.
[97:47.67]Doesn't that make me a sloth?
[97:50.99]I would be a loyal warrior.
[97:54.78]What?
[97:56.88]Why is everybody doing MonkaS?
[98:00.82]How often do you visit the grooming parlor?
[98:02.80]Are you kidding?
[98:03.36]I practically live there.
[98:04.46]I go there often.
[98:06.24]I'll swing by on half price day to get like a bargain to get like a shower or something.
[98:09.99]I don't know.
[98:11.29]If you could be the star of any game, what would it be?

[98:31.72]It's a clown slug.
[98:36.56]Mood.
[98:44.62]Well, I can't say mood to try to connect with the millennials and the zoomer crowd.
[98:48.76]Why not?
[98:49.04]Alright, I'm the pink slory.
[98:51.88]That's pretty cool.
[98:52.42]It's a clown slug.
[98:54.93]No, you can't.
[98:55.71]Yes, I can.
[98:56.85]I'm allowed to do that.
[98:58.71]Hey.
[98:59.57]You know how fucking... You know how chaotic I am.
[99:03.91]I'll do something crazy.
[99:05.49]You don't fucking agree with me.
[99:12.62]I'm not even going to talk for this one.
[99:20.03]Look at how many fucking ads are on this page.
[99:22.51]Have you ever got bit by a dog?
[99:24.31]No.
[99:25.77]How intimidating are you?
[99:27.87]Not really.
[99:29.22]Are you wild, calm, or somewhere in the middle?
[99:32.28]I'm sorry, somewhere in the middle.
[99:34.48]How forgetful are you?
[99:35.42]I forget everything.
[99:38.40]Do you have any problems with bullies?
[99:44.70]Do they count?
[99:46.64]Do they count?
[99:52.10]You understand irony.
[99:54.70]Yes.
[99:56.62]What do your clothes look like?
[99:58.58]I look like my... I look like my clothes were made for me because they were.
[100:02.72]They looked stretched because of my bulging muscles.
[100:06.54]I don't... whatever.
[100:07.14]Do you smoke cigarettes?
[100:08.60]No.
[100:08.86]Why would that have to do with a fursona?

[100:30.87]Skate wheel.
[100:32.11]Ab wheel.
[100:32.61]Wheel of fortune.
[100:33.47]Well, I don't know.
[100:33.95]I don't care about the elements.
[100:35.23]You want to eat, but you don't have a fork.
[100:36.83]I'll eat with a popsicle stick.
[100:39.56]I'll swallow the food whole.
[100:40.80]That's what teeth are for.
[100:41.90]I guess I'll just starve to death.
[100:44.90]I'll just suck it up with my mouth.
[100:49.52]What, like... Just on the plate?
[100:53.75]Okay, what animal would do that?
[100:57.71]Okay.
[100:59.53]I would probably try to use some kind of... I would try to use, like, chopsticks or some kind of utensil.
[101:05.00]I'm outgoing.
[101:06.46]And you fly.
[101:09.18]No.

[103:17.62]Stop with the fucking engagements.
[103:20.20]I almost was the snake.
[103:22.98]Wait.
[103:25.44]Oh, no, this is what people were.
[103:32.35]Caw, caw.
[103:33.65]Oh, why did I just say that out loud?

[103:56.46]This one's stupid.
[103:58.00]This is an animal theme.
[104:00.08]What historical figure do you admire?
[104:02.06]I don't know.
[104:08.42]The warrior queen.
[104:12.12]Which of these living figures do you admire?
[104:13.82]Why is Shaun White on here?
[104:20.78]Wait, Shaun White the snowboarder?
[104:29.57]You know why I admire Shaun White the most?
[104:32.47]Because he got on this list somehow.
[104:36.19]Do you enjoy reading?
[104:43.10]Yeah.
[104:44.81]How well do you cook?
[104:46.77]I call for takeout.

[104:48.53]What's first on your Saturday agenda?
[104:52.85]Sleeping in.
[104:54.66]What's your approach to fashion?
[104:55.88]I spend money on good clothes, but I don't have a signature look.

[105:00.78]Yep.
[105:02.56]What genre of music do you enjoy most?
[105:09.93]Classical.
[105:10.61]No, that's not even right.
[105:11.77]Can I change my answer?
[105:12.41]That's not even right.
[105:13.63]Why did I... No.
[105:14.67]Old-fashioned rock and roll.
[105:15.55]I changed my answer.
[105:18.11]Opera.
[105:18.87]I don't give a shit about opera.
[105:20.11]Why would I click that?
[105:22.87]Hold on.
[105:23.63]Wait.
[105:23.97]That sounds pretty rude.
[105:24.77]What I meant to say was I don't listen to opera.
[105:28.77]Not that I don't care.
[105:29.91]It's a very, very hard thing to do.
[105:31.19]Very talented people do opera.
[105:35.50]Which of these would you like most for breakfast?
[105:41.64]Eggs, bacon, to- yeah, oh yeah.
[105:44.72]What kind of home suits you best?
[105:46.66]A townhouse, a simple house, a wired one with everything controlled from my phone.
[105:50.74]That's terrifying, I don't want that.
[105:52.92]I want the thing that's completely- I want the fucking cottage that has no electricity and you shit in a fucking bathtub 40 feet behind the back door.
[106:00.59]I don't want that.
[106:03.33]Studio I could clean with a hose.
[106:05.27]Okay, that's pretty good.
[106:07.59]Which of these would you most likely choose as a hobby?
[106:12.54]I already did that, so we'll do that one.
[106:15.34]What's your idea of a good first date?
[106:22.95]This one is like, I would just pretend to know what I was doing.
[106:26.07]This is the real one.
[106:27.53]This is the one that I'm pretending.
[106:30.91]Oh.
[106:32.19]Wow.
[106:33.01]Yeah, I brought you here, and I'm very, very smart.
[106:37.63]No, it'd be bowling and a couple of beers or something.
[106:40.51]What's a good age to get married?
[107:05.75]How many children do you have or want?

[107:18.69]Comedy.
[107:20.23]How do you feel about marijuana?
[107:21.49]Let me tell you.
[107:23.70]CBD, THC, it pretty much changed my fucking life.
[107:28.92]I started taking...
[107:30.45]For medical reasons, marijuana.
[107:32.47]And I had a lot of pain problems.
[107:33.96]And just giving you some anecdotal evidence.
[107:38.16]Felt a little better.
[107:39.46]Not too much.
[107:40.00]Don't be a fucking psycho.
[107:41.84]If it's legal in your area, and you can maybe try it.
[107:44.30]If it's legal, and you're not breaking any fucking rules, don't do anything stupid.
[107:48.07]Maybe in a safe environment.
[107:50.59]It did a lot for me, actually.
[107:52.81]I would testify.
[107:54.89]It's kind of smelly and low rent.
[107:57.57]What do you mean low rent?
[108:00.89]It means low rent.
[108:03.85]How do I delete that?
[108:11.43]Okay.
[108:13.91]If you say this, why do I feel like you smoke, like, cigarettes, like, two packs a day, and, like, you, like, coke is in your fridge more than the actual drink?
[108:29.02]You get a gift card.
[108:29.78]This is a... How fucking detailed is this to determine what kind of a horse I am?
[108:35.38]What?
[108:39.15]With this one I'm halfway... What kind of... Why is it so detailed?
[108:42.15]This better be accurate.
[108:45.21]You get a gift card to a well-stocked shoe shop.
[108:46.85]What do you buy?
[108:48.83]Comfortable.
[108:50.46]No.
[108:51.00]No.
[108:52.76]Nothing comfortable.
[108:54.60]You've had a fight with your significant other.
[108:55.98]How do you resolve it?
[108:58.78]Sounds dull, but it's usually talking out.
[109:00.32]A brood for a while.
[109:02.38]I've got to apologize.
[109:03.74]I know it's arrogant.
[109:08.17]Make up sex.
[109:13.35]What?
[109:13.91]Okay.
[109:16.03]Listen.
[109:19.03]What does this have to do with a horse?
[109:23.01]Horses don't talk to each other.
[109:25.53]Horses don't like have breakups and then make up sex.
[109:30.91]like horses don't like have like that it's not like there's no what arguments would you have sex on the first date oh god this is some weird fucking date of mine to be honest I have but I tell my kids not to I'm such a hypocrite
[110:12.35]No.
[110:14.11]No.
[110:15.07]I'm sorry.
[110:15.74]No.
[110:16.96]Not on the first date.
[110:17.80]Come on.
[110:20.26]No.
[110:24.20]Look.
[110:25.92]It's going to take me a few dates to find out if you don't want to take a vaccine.
[110:33.51]You know what I mean?
[110:35.37]It's going to take me a few days for you to be like, oh, and by the way, I think that we're all aliens.
[110:43.50]Oh!
[110:43.66]Date number two!
[110:47.09]We had sex two days ago!
[110:50.85]This person thinks that we're aliens!
[110:55.23]Now you want to come back over.
[110:56.46]How about we, uh... Let's talk for the rest of the day and...
[111:07.81]Listen to me.
[111:08.93]Some of you guys might be in the age where you're dating, you're talking to people.
[111:13.04]Give it a little bit of time.
[111:14.86]Trust me.
[111:17.04]At least a few dates.
[111:18.44]At least a couple of weeks.
[111:20.58]Then you'll figure that out after maybe a few weeks.
[111:24.05]And this is a banger.
[111:35.38]Don't die, it's obscene, be careful, be careful.
[111:38.47]What kind of pet appeals to you?
[111:40.89]Dog.
[111:49.84]At what point in a marriage is it best to get a divorce?
[111:52.70]What the fuck does this have to do with horses?
[112:02.27]What does this have to do with horses?
[112:07.03]When it's hurting the kids.
[112:15.43]I mean, if you're just not happy anymore, I don't know.
[112:21.20]If you can make it work for the sake of the family, maybe.
[112:23.76]I don't know.
[112:24.36]But if you don't make yourself suffer.
[112:26.34]Well, on a day of the company picnic, you can usually be found anchoring the winning team in a tug of war.
[112:35.12]I'm at home.
[112:35.73]I don't want to go.
[112:38.29]No.
[112:40.11]How important is sex to you, Mr. Horse?
[112:44.23]Wait, horses fuck all the time.
[112:46.49]Don't they?
[112:47.60]Horses fuck more than rabbits.
[112:49.64]I guess that makes sense.
[112:51.66]How important is sex?
[113:03.22]Why is there an answer every time about like being a degenerate and lying about it?
[113:08.04]What horse is like fucking and lying to all their horse friends?
[113:18.31]I don't understand.
[113:18.97]I keep up a good front.
[113:26.61]It's good.
[113:27.47]It's great.
[113:28.13]But don't make a fool out of yourself.
[113:30.41]Don't fucking... Yeah, don't make a fool out of yourself.
[113:33.84]I want to have sex.
[113:35.06]Just relax.
[113:37.14]Which of these cars would you prefer?
[113:40.88]None of them.
[113:44.02]Where's a Honda Civic?
[113:45.10]I don't want any of these.
[113:52.62]Kingdom Hearts.
[113:54.26]Dun!
[113:55.26]Dun!
[113:56.26]Dun!
[113:57.32]Dun!
[113:57.80]That's not... What is this?
[113:59.51]This is Legend of this Breath of the Wild.
[114:01.05]Alright, if I had to pick one of these, it'd be a Tesla.
[114:05.75]And I know, like, who wants a Tesla?
[114:07.57]I didn't say that.
[114:08.21]I said if I had to choose, this would be the Tesla that I would fucking pick.
[114:11.93]I don't want to die on a motorcycle.
[114:17.27]It's fucking... It's horrible.
[114:18.41]I don't like that.
[114:19.59]I don't... I want to be safe.
[114:21.46]This is too big and I don't know what that is.
[114:28.92]Which of these popular writers books might you choose for a long plane ride?
[114:35.89]I don't... I don't want to read that.
[114:38.61]I've already seen the movie.
[114:39.69]I don't know who these other authors are.
[114:51.54]We're gonna go with Tim.
[114:54.77]If a book is too heavy to lug around at airports and planes, can you pick a magazine instead?
[114:59.91]Do you have the entire encyclopedia?
[115:06.79]What do you mean too big?
[115:10.31]How many books are you carrying?
[115:14.55]I would probably read... I don't know, like... I would look, I would pick up a Time magazine and just go like this.
[115:22.84]And then look at the, like, the four cologne ads.
[115:26.14]And open them and be the guy that opens them, and smells them, and then puts, closes it.
[115:32.48]I wouldn't even read any of the, I don't read any of the articles.
[115:35.72]It's late but you're hungry.
[115:37.26]What's a good midnight snack?
[115:39.12]Gross.
[115:43.64]I, I, ice cream.
[115:47.88]This is still going.
[115:49.22]I can't fucking believe it's still going.
[115:51.56]You've got two weeks off from work and a lot of frequent flyer miles.
[115:54.26]Where are you going?
[115:56.42]Go to Hawaii.
[115:58.50]If you took up gardening, what would be most likely?
[116:01.09]What would you grow?
[116:01.71]Where's lemons?
[116:04.25]No, not orchids.
[116:04.91]Not roses.
[116:05.69]That's too generic.
[116:07.97]Vegetables.
[116:08.43]Where's lemons and limes?
[116:10.31]That's what I want.
[116:11.03]Where's lemons?
[116:11.87]Vegetables.
[116:12.23]That's the closest answer.
[116:14.38]Your closest friend would most likely describe you as uniquely interesting.
[116:21.10]That's a way to say that somebody's scary without making them angry.
[116:34.97]Oh, a lot of fun.
[116:38.75]I'm a Clydesdale!
[116:42.89]I'm the, I'm the uh... That's the beer one!
[116:46.49]That's the one that's in the beer commercials!
[116:48.25]No it's not.
[116:50.55]Is it?
[116:51.95]Is that the, is that the Anheuser Busch?
[116:55.95]Yeah it is, yeah it's Budweiser.
[116:57.09]I've been drinking the same White Claw for two hours, this is disgusting now.
[117:08.38]I've been nursing this for two straight hours.
[117:11.40]That's gross.
[117:14.30]You put the work- alright, this- I don't like- this music is too... ominous.
[117:18.86]Alright, you put the work in workhorse.
[117:22.86]No one can stand in your way when you're determined to get something done.
[117:25.62]You're really equally comfortable working alone or in a team.
[117:28.50]And when it's the latter, you never sh- shirk your share of the duties.
[117:33.04]We also suspect that people just naturally like you.
[117:35.60]Especially children.
[117:37.20]Oh, and you fuck all the time.
[117:39.24]You have sex in the kitchen, in the laundry room, with like thousands of different people.
[117:43.86]You are fucking every day.
[117:45.62]All you do is have sex.
[117:47.80]In fact, you may even have had sex 10 minutes ago and 10 minutes after the stream ends.
[117:53.64]You're Clydesdale.
[117:54.96]Thanks for answering our fucked up questions.
[118:07.17]Fire Emblem.
[118:16.89]I'm afraid to do this one.
[118:18.11]What Jerma985 emote are you?

[118:21.35]Hello.
[118:23.21]Where's your ideal place to travel to?
[118:25.39]Japan.
[118:26.03]Okay, cool.
[118:27.01]Somebody right now is going, he fucking actually clicked mine.
[118:33.94]How would you people describe you?
[118:36.26]You made this in 15 minutes.
[118:37.82]I don't chill.
[118:42.16]What type of day do you prefer?
[118:44.20]Morning for walks.
[118:45.28]Morning to work.
[118:46.08]The time when this quiz ends.

[134:42.86]I will.
[134:44.00]Are people you know invested in the stock market?
[134:46.64]Sometimes.
[134:48.95]Why are you investing in the stock market?
[134:50.41]Because someone told I'm smart.
[134:53.32]Which would you prefer?
[134:54.10]High risk.
[134:55.00]How often do you check on stocks?
[134:57.08]Uh, every single day.
[134:59.24]Are you spontaneous?
[135:00.14]Of course I am.
[135:00.85]How many shares are you willing to buy?
[135:01.95]A ton.
[135:02.67]Do you save a lot of money?
[135:03.59]Yeah, yeah.
[135:05.33]How much are you willing to lose?
[135:06.35]A lot.
[135:08.15]Are you going to invest alone?
[135:09.55]What?
[135:12.24]We're gonna go into like a carpool of sharing?
[135:15.07]Shares?
[135:15.53]No.
[135:16.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[135:18.35]I'm gonna invest.
[135:19.37]Oh, of course I'm gonna invest alone.
[135:21.63]How good are you at budgeting?
[135:23.33]Not very good.
[135:24.29]How important is the integrity of the company you want to invest in?
[135:26.62]Did I make 30%?
[135:27.76]It's kind of important.
[135:31.28]Do your magic ability to... Hold on.
[135:34.02]What season do you plan on investing?
[135:35.50]All of them.
[135:38.20]You should invest in Capital One.
[135:40.94]No, you shouldn't.
[135:42.14]Why would you do that?
[135:42.94]I don't want to invest in a bank!
[135:46.34]Actually real.
[135:47.08]What?
[135:47.98]Click it, coward.
[135:48.86]What?
[135:49.06]Hold on!
[135:59.14]Yeah, you took a screenshot of my face.
[136:00.69]So what?
[136:09.00]No, I don't want to invest in Capital One.
[136:11.04]Wait, there's only a few.
[136:12.46]They're all banks.
[136:16.94]JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Bank of America.
[136:20.08]What's going on with my face?
[136:23.54]Why is the camera so fucked up?
[136:24.78]What's going on here?
[136:27.41]Why is it going like... Why is the refresh rate so fucked up?
[136:35.49]Why is it doing this?
[136:39.99]Cut that out!
[136:43.23]Why is it doing that?
[136:43.87]It's cause... I'm a hologram.
[136:52.90]Just turn myself green and stop talking Star Wars stuff.
[136:55.76]Hey!
[136:56.94]Speaking of Star Wars... Why is it fucking doing this?
[137:04.12]How do I fix this?
[137:10.97]How do I do this?
[137:11.65]What's going on?
[137:12.83]Refresh rate is at 60 hertz.
[137:14.39]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[137:23.64]Launch your camera.
[137:25.10]Turn on your lights.
[137:26.00]It's the lights?
[137:32.34]Oh, I got it.
[137:32.88]It's gone.
[137:33.63]But now I'm all, like, wiggly.
[137:44.55]This camera sucks.
[137:50.00]I got it.
[137:50.28]We're good, right?
[137:54.22]No more scan lines, right?
[137:55.32]No, we're good.
[138:00.62]Okay, I'm not going to invest in Capital One.
[138:02.83]I feel like somebody made this because they own a bunch of shares in all these banks and they're like, maybe I can get these fucking people to buy this shit.
[138:20.05]What's going on over there?
[138:20.91]Okay, choose your weapon.
[138:26.83]Ooh, I don't know.
[138:28.34]It's either going to be electricity or it's going to be the lightsaber.
[138:30.52]It's the lightsaber, obviously.
[138:32.88]What kind of childhood did you have?
[138:34.28]Oh, this is a long one.
[138:35.60]Fucking God.
[138:36.40]Okay, okay, okay.
[138:37.74]Alright, can I just say... I'm General Grievous, alright?
[138:41.78]That's the guy I most relate to.
[138:43.27]Next.
[138:43.49]Time for do who, what Marvel character?
[138:48.46]We know which Marvel character matches your personality.
[138:59.49]Oh, show the image, I forgot.
[139:03.43]This is a Reddit quiz.
[139:15.21]That's like, that's like your annoyed cat.
[139:19.50]I mean, wrong one.
[139:27.13]That's a wrong image.

[140:34.31]Okay, which Marvel character am I?
[140:45.88]Captain America!
[140:46.64]Okay, the Marvel superhero teams are- Where's the music?
[140:50.26]Fuck you.
[140:53.63]Oh, Undertale!
[140:56.37]Undertale!
[141:01.67]Alright, can I say... I'm gonna say this, and I think it's accurate.
[141:09.05]The Undertale soundtrack... could be... one of the best.
[141:15.68]One of the top, probably, three soundtracks in any video game.
[141:19.70]Probably, like, top five.
[141:21.10]At least somewhere in the top three.
[141:24.38]It just is.
[141:25.20]Okay, whether you like this game, or you're like, I don't like that, I don't like the fanbase, I don't like them.
[141:29.44]Whatever.
[141:30.53]These songs are objectively, like, fucking... Bang!
[141:33.93]Minecraft and Undertale?
[141:37.15]Yeah, you're right.
[141:37.57]Those are pretty high.
[141:42.73]Okay, if I had you just, like, in a room, and you had, like, a blindfold on, and you had, like, a thing covering your ears, and, like, you didn't know what this was.
[141:51.76]If I was like, alright, take it off!
[141:52.74]Take the headphones off!
[141:53.74]Take the eye shield off!
[141:55.82]And you heard this, and I was like, what do you think?
[141:57.72]You'd be like,
[142:03.22]Right, I like it.
[142:03.98]It's good.
[142:04.78]This is good.
[142:06.28]And then I'd say, hey, you know who that's from, right?
[142:09.68]No, what is it from?
[142:10.62]Super Mario 2?
[142:12.20]No.
[142:12.70]Is it from Earthbound?
[142:13.99]No.
[142:14.97]Where's it from, then?
[142:16.25]It's from Undertale.
[142:22.79]I... No, it isn't.
[142:25.31]It's not.
[142:25.71]It can't be.
[142:27.85]I can't like it.
[142:32.02]I just get an ad in the middle of that song.
[142:35.40]Alright, let's go with this.
[142:43.08]Okay, the Marvel superhero teams are all drafting new members.
[142:45.57]Which one do you want to be a part of?
[142:47.37]Nobody wants to be on the Fantastic Four.
[142:48.95]No, because there's only four of you.
[142:52.77]And if there's a job that has to be done, one of those four people has to do it.
[142:56.71]That would suck.
[142:59.32]I want to be on the X-Men, because there's like 40 of us.
[143:02.92]And if somebody has to go do something, Hey!
[143:05.20]We need like three magic users and a guy with a big fist and crystal explosives!
[143:11.98]It's like, okay.
[143:13.50]That could be like eight different people.
[143:15.12]I can stay home.
[143:16.72]Oh, uh, okay, like, uh, Gambit and Cyclops and Beast.
[143:21.69]You guys, you got that, right?
[143:22.87]I can stay and just play fucking Fortnite.
[143:25.51]Okay.
[143:26.83]Go for it, man.
[143:27.83]Like, hey, I'll get the next one, like, tomorrow.
[143:29.75]If you're on the Fantastic Four, you gotta do shit every day.
[143:32.52]Nope, X-Men.
[143:35.80]You can't, like, lounge on the couch if you're Mr. Fantastic.
[143:39.50]You can't, like, put that on somebody else.
[143:43.20]What motivates you?
[143:50.10]This is fucking two and a half hours old.
[143:52.46]I'm gonna need another one.
[143:54.22]Did I buy two?
[143:55.08]I did.
[144:02.57]Ugh.
[144:05.15]I-I-I want to have friends and shit.
[144:07.35]Alright, tonight's the night.
[144:08.21]You're going on your third date with the most perfect person in the world.
[144:12.73]What did I tell you?
[144:14.19]All the viewers here, this is what I told you.
[144:17.23]What makes, uh, what makes them attractive to you?
[144:19.77]Oh, hold on.
[144:21.43]Let's get back over here.
[144:24.52]Ugh.
[144:27.10]What makes them attractive?
[144:28.52]They're sarcastic and witty.
[144:30.46]They have a strong moral compass.
[144:31.74]They've got a wicked charm.
[144:32.78]They're super smart.
[144:33.68]They're really rich.
[144:35.15]They're super ripped.
[144:36.69]They can keep a secret.
[144:38.29]They just have this dark intensity to them.
[144:52.71]When it comes to relationships, would you ever date another superhero?
[144:57.66]Yes, absolutely.
[144:58.76]I need someone who understands my lifestyle.
[145:00.58]No way.
[145:00.88]It's too dangerous.
[145:01.72]I'm not really interested.
[145:02.62]I feel like the answer is probably yeah.
[145:11.93]Because if I levitate the pizza rolls across the living room, they're not going to be freaked out by that.
[145:19.79]They're going to be like, oh, okay, you're a dick.
[145:22.13]But if I do that in front of someone that doesn't have powers, they're going to be like,
[145:27.73]You couldn't just get up?
[145:30.41]No, I couldn't just get up.
[145:32.21]Why couldn't you just get up?
[145:33.93]Look, I've got fucking superpowers.
[145:35.77]I don't have to get up.
[145:36.39]You would never understand.
[145:40.39]Okay, if you had it your way, I could have it my way at Burger King.
[145:44.43]But I wouldn't want to go.
[145:45.31]I wouldn't want to have it my way there.
[145:46.51]I'd want to go to McDonald's.
[145:47.33]I'd want to go to the drive-thru and just drive through it and go to the McDonald's next door.
[145:51.19]What would your last meal be?
[146:00.22]Last meal candy.
[146:03.20]No.
[146:03.78]It'd be something like... It was like a steak dinner or something.
[146:09.78]Fast food.
[146:12.14]You suspect someone close to you has betrayed you.
[146:14.54]What do you do?
[146:17.75]Trick them into confessing.
[146:18.89]Please give me Loki.
[146:20.27]Please give me Loki.
[146:21.09]Please give me Loki.
[146:21.93]Please, I'm going to do everything that Loki would do so I get Loki and then I can share it.
[146:26.35]Uh, hold on.
[146:32.29]Give them the benefit of the doubt.
[146:34.39]Kill them before they do any damage.
[146:36.41]Destroy them, of course.
[146:37.37]Aren't these the same?
[146:38.47]Confront them about this terrible rumor.
[146:40.67]Find a way to use this to my advantage.
[146:42.83]I'll just have a few words with them over drinks.
[146:52.78]Doctor Doom has stolen the powers of the Silver Surfer and taken over the world.
[146:56.28]How will you stop him?
[146:59.82]I mean, motherfucker, I'm on the X-Men.
[147:02.98]Call somebody else.
[147:06.30]I'll stand- Oh, I'll get up.
[147:08.47]Oh, you already got up?
[147:09.79]Hey.
[147:10.93]Oh, Jubilee already got up.
[147:12.81]Alright, yeah.
[147:13.41]No, go for it.
[147:16.93]What I don't know is I don't have any fucking powers.
[147:21.48]I lied on my application.
[147:24.74]Okay.
[147:25.36]Dr. Doom stole the powers of the- Too much Sonic the Hedgehog.
[147:34.71]No, no Halo.
[147:38.89]No, no Battlefield 1.
[147:39.95]No.
[147:40.17]Come on, something good.
[147:44.88]Killzone 3?
[147:45.76]No.
[147:45.92]Mario Odyssey.
[147:50.74]Oh my goodness.
[147:52.20]This is the one I want.
[147:56.14]Okay, so Dr. Doom stole the powers of the Silver Surfer and taken over the world.
[147:58.71]How will you stop him?
[147:59.55]Since Dr. Doom is bound by honor, I tried to reason with him.
[148:01.71]If he didn't work, I'd use force.
[148:04.84]I'd fight him.
[148:05.44]I'm smarter than him.
[148:07.60]My ego demands it.
[148:08.28]Well, that depends.
[148:08.78]It's the person I love in danger.
[148:09.92]I'll always try to do the right thing.
[148:12.20]It means getting my butt handed to me.
[148:15.34]I'd join the Fantastic Four and work as a team.
[148:17.54]The situation's bigger than me.
[148:18.72]No, you wouldn't.
[148:19.76]No, you wouldn't.
[148:20.30]We just discussed this.
[148:24.05]I would try to reason with Dr. Doom first.
[148:29.03]Oh, you just got caught driving too fast, and now you got a speeding ticket.
[148:32.37]What do you do?
[148:33.84]I'd say, thank you, officer, and pay the fine.
[148:37.68]Please, the police officer would be putty in my hands.
[148:39.95]I could talk them out of anything.
[148:42.61]I'd rip the ticket up, flip off the cop, and be on my merry way.
[148:53.52]I'd try to make the cop laugh and get out of the ticket, but if that didn't work, I'd accept it and move on.
[148:58.30]I would, I would talk, I would, please.
[149:02.81]What's your favorite part about being a superhero?
[149:05.73]Having the coolest toys.
[149:06.89]Meeting other people like me.
[149:07.87]I always thought I was alone.
[149:09.33]These are my powers to help others who can't help themselves.
[149:15.90]I kind of like the mystery aspect of it.
[149:19.16]I better not get Superman.
[149:20.02]That's boring.
[149:21.26]One of your coworkers is always putting you down.
[149:23.02]What do you do about it?
[149:23.94]Okay, is the coworker also a superhero?
[149:29.66]Or is it just like I'm working in the office?
[149:32.92]Is it just a superhero?
[149:34.44]Is it an X-Men?
[149:36.54]Is it an X-character?
[149:37.48]I'd pull the person aside and talk to them privately, find out what's really going on.
[149:43.64]You know, I can only take so much before I explode.
[149:45.42]I'll just walk away, I've got bigger fish to fry.
[149:47.55]I'd just write back to them and make them cry.
[149:50.91]I'd take whatever they say as a compliment and diffuse the situation.
[149:53.21]I'd turn their insult into a joke.
[149:56.69]And then we would all laugh at them.
[149:59.36]Nick Fury has asked you to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.
[150:01.66]and go out to dinner with a very important client.
[150:07.36]That turned in a different way.
[150:10.14]Oh, Nick Fury has asked you to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.
[150:12.26]and go on a very important mission.
[150:14.28]Actually, this is perfect for me.
[150:17.77]Me?
[150:18.29]Can I do that one?
[150:20.39]The only catch, the breath is atrocious.
[150:22.85]Can I be the guy that goes out to the dinner?
[150:24.75]It's fine, I don't have to get in harm's way.
[150:26.95]Okay, the breath is terrible.
[150:30.15]I'd ignore their breath and pay for the meal.
[150:31.90]I'd cancel the dinner and order takeout.
[150:33.64]I can't stand annoying, smelly people.
[150:39.34]I'd politely offer a mint and say, this is a rare candy from another dimension that must be enjoyed.
[150:44.92]It might be that one.
[150:48.70]Because then you can laugh.
[150:50.78]You can laugh about that.
[150:52.90]You give them the mint and you both go like... It's an Altoid.
[150:58.92]Rrrrrrrr.
[151:00.05]And you're in, and everything's fine.
[151:01.45]And like, you're good.
[151:03.38]That would work.
[151:07.78]I'd end the meal quickly and say, sorry, but Nick Fury needs me to save the world.
[151:11.04]Yeah, it would be this one.
[151:14.67]You have a big day planned at work, but wake up with a cold.
[151:17.25]What do you do?
[151:21.11]Hmm.
[151:23.17]Roll back in bed and get some rest.
[151:24.15]There's no way I'm going to work today.
[151:25.77]Suck it up and go to work.
[151:26.67]No.
[151:26.97]Call my boss and let him know I'm sick so that I can work remotely.
[151:28.95]I'm going back to bed.
[151:31.07]What's your relationship to large family gatherings like holidays and family reunions?
[151:37.47]I think they're great.
[151:38.37]I like them.
[151:38.77]I like going to family.
[151:39.61]Pick one thing from a fairy tale to have with you in everyday life.
[151:42.81]What is it?
[151:43.17]Why would you carry around a poison apple?
[151:47.71]A genie that grants three wishes.
[151:49.14]A magical singing voice.
[151:52.95]of woodland friends poison apple okay this is the only one that cannot be obtained normally you can make a shitload of woodland friends you could have a bunch of you go to the woods and make like friends with the squirrels and just bring like seeds and nuts with you they'll all like you you can train to be a singer and you can just put poison in an apple like this is the only one you cannot get normally I'm getting three wishes
[152:23.44]Oh, it's Far Cry, the game that I lied about.
[152:26.11]Skip it.
[152:28.67]Okay, we're at, uh... It's time to get deep.
[152:32.05]At least when it comes to exploration.
[152:33.43]That's right, we're making you pick.
[152:34.61]Deep sea or deep space?
[152:36.07]Where would you rather explore?
[152:41.43]Deep sea, man.
[152:42.53]The deep, deep space is just... I feel like it's a bunch of nothing.
[152:47.80]It's just a bunch of, like, colors and little lights and shit, and that's cool.
[152:52.06]But there's creatures we haven't even seen before in the deep sea.
[152:55.74]It would be so interesting to be under there and just, like, lie on the ground and look at all, like, the sharks and stuff and all, like, the weird deep sea animals.
[153:01.98]Deep space is too much.
[153:03.06]It's too much to do.
[153:04.79]It would freak me out.
[153:06.69]I'd be like, oh, cool, deep space.
[153:08.15]I guess it's gonna take me, like, 30 years to go from here to there.
[153:11.07]Even if I fly with my superpowers, it's, like, 6 million light years away where I could just go, like, 2 miles deep and see a weird fish.
[153:17.11]That one.

[154:10.22]And get skinny.
[154:11.52]I can do whatever I want.
[154:13.56]I can do whatever the fuck I want.
[154:20.53]I could go back in time, and I could like... I could go forward in time and see what happens, and then go back, and then fix it, and then go forward again, and then get stuck.
[154:27.77]How would you rate your relative cleanliness?

[156:10.02]All they do is talk about themselves.
[156:11.28]They complain a lot.
[156:11.96]They have no manners.
[156:13.06]They're boring and can't hold a conversation.
[156:14.56]One of us forgets their wallet.
[156:16.34]They're into astrology.
[156:22.23]That's probably this one.
[156:23.23]Because that's just fucking awkward.
[156:24.58]Because then it makes the other person have to pay for the meal.
[156:27.82]And then it's like, oh, shit.
[156:30.78]Well, it looks like it's gonna be you.
[156:35.47]Take one of these foods.
[156:36.31]Congratulations, you're now eating only this food for the rest of your life.
[156:40.13]Hope you choose wisely.
[156:41.59]But what did you choose?
[156:43.79]Alright, for the rest of my life.
[156:46.90]Let's break this down.
[156:47.58]Steak is just protein.
[156:48.59]It's just meat.
[156:49.43]Not enough.
[156:50.27]I couldn't do it.

[156:53.41]No.
[156:53.99]Pizza.
[156:54.54]Could work.
[156:55.68]Tomato sauce is just technically tomato.
[156:58.04]Cheese.
[156:58.38]You get the bread.
[156:58.88]You get a protein with the cheese.
[156:59.92]Maybe.
[157:00.78]Sushi.
[157:02.31]I don't know if I want to eat sushi every day, though.
[157:03.71]I feel like it really, it would, I'd probably get sick if I ate it too much.
[157:08.74]That's like, that could be like, it could be green onions.
[157:12.42]Thanksgiving turkey.
[157:13.80]Does that include the rest of the fixings, though?
[157:15.60]Is that Thanksgiving turkey and the mayo, the cranberry sauce, the mashed potatoes, the gravy?
[157:20.83]Is it Thanksgiving dinner, or is it just Thanksgiving turkey?
[157:22.91]Just turkey, okay.
[157:24.91]Pasta?
[157:25.51]No, you'd puke.
[157:28.29]Okay, sandwiches is the answer here.
[157:31.53]A sandwich could be anything.
[157:34.45]You could have a turkey sandwich.
[157:36.55]You could have a ham sandwich.
[157:37.79]You could have... Just put anything between two pieces of bread and you'd get all the sandwich.
[157:41.89]You could put celery and onions in between bread and it's a sandwich.
[157:45.76]It could be anything.
[157:47.24]You could get all your food groups that way.
[157:48.44]That'd be easy.
[157:50.08]What social faux pas really grates your gears the most?
[157:52.18]What sends you into a blind rage for no reason?
[157:54.50]Okay, I've done this.
[157:58.28]I've done this.
[157:58.76]I don't know about that.
[158:01.54]I've done this.
[158:03.41]I've done this.
[158:05.70]Not that one.
[158:06.50]People feel the need to play Devil's Advocate in every situation.
[158:13.58]Probably phone addict, man.
[158:17.24]Probably phone addict.
[158:17.88]I mean, come on.
[158:18.34]Put your phone down.
[158:20.33]Like, we're out doing something together.
[158:21.91]We're having a good time.
[158:23.11]Put the phone down.
[158:24.73]Put down the phone.
[158:25.23]I get to be Iron Man.
[158:29.95]I get to be Iron Man!
[158:33.61]You are not afraid to just go for it, whatever it may be.
[158:35.83]Yes, you're arrogant, but no, I'm not.
[158:37.97]But that's only because you've accomplished so many things in life.
[158:40.60]If life gives you lemons, you'll find a way to revolutionize the entire lemon industry before breakfast.
[158:45.52]Insanely competitive.
[158:46.48]You're married to your job, and if you did happen to get married to an actual person, we're willing to bet they'd have something to do with your job.
[158:53.30]You can be a prick, but you're willing to sacrifice everything to help other people, and that's not insignificant.
[158:57.76]Share your results with your friends.
[159:02.01]But I'm not a billionaire, though.
[159:05.81]It's funny because I started playing GTA today.

[184:05.52]A toddler cannot be a smart, loyal, self-proclaimed nerd.
[184:13.60]You love playing video games and watching superheroes.

[185:29.67]Sit down.
[185:32.07]Now, what time of the day do you feel your best?
[185:36.83]Is it in the morning?
[185:38.15]Is it in the afternoon?
[185:39.41]Or is it in the early evening?
[185:40.94]Or is it late at night?
[185:43.42]Phil, I don't want to be on your show.
[185:47.69]When do you feel your best?
[185:48.59]I feel... Doctor... Hey, can I call you Doctor?

[186:32.80]Whatever.
[186:33.26]That's not important at all.
[186:35.24]The theme song to this show is fucking insane.
[186:41.29]We have to listen to it because I cannot comprehend why this theme song is the way that it is.
[186:46.78]It's time to play it.

[194:52.73]I fucking can't even do it anymore, guys.
[194:59.78]Anyways.
[195:01.32]Yes.
[195:03.13]It's like the first part of a chorus, and they just say it like six times, and then the show starts.
[195:08.79]I've seen like eight episodes of this show.
[195:10.78]Everybody just stand up.
[195:16.83]Okay, alright, put your hands up.
[195:18.35]Okay.
[195:19.41]Everybody just stand up.
[195:21.24]Jeff, I already am.
[195:22.70]Put your hands up.
[195:23.46]Jeff, they're up.
[195:24.96]Just stand up.
[195:26.20]I'm standing and my hands are up.
[195:27.74]What should I do now?
[195:28.56]Should I praise God?
[195:30.14]No, just stand up.
[195:38.67]I can't.
[195:39.03]It's fucking crazy.
[195:41.01]I love it though.
[195:41.73]It's like my favorite theme song.
[195:45.78]Anyways, Dr. Phil's, uh... I almost said Dr. Phil's community subs, like he gave a shitload.
[195:52.45]Alright.
[195:54.37]You guys standing up?
[195:54.99]Are your hands up yet?
[195:57.90]Okay.
[195:58.54]You usually walk fairly fast.
[196:00.96]I need some music.
[196:02.92]Let me get some music on for this.
[196:04.10]Not this, but...
[196:23.94]Just had to hear it again to make sure it was real.
[196:25.60]Okay.
[196:26.50]Uh, we had an OST going.
[196:29.92]I lost it because there's so many links.
[196:32.80]Here we go.
[196:33.34]Okay.
[196:33.72]OST.
[196:34.24]We're going back to Mega Man.
[196:37.60]No.
[196:37.86]Dead by Daylight.
[196:39.12]Spoiler.
[196:39.48]I never played it.
[196:42.05]Oh.
[196:42.33]Doctor Doom's Battle.
[196:44.35]No.
[196:48.71]Mario Galaxy 2.
[196:49.57]This is way too fucking loud.
[196:52.05]I'm sorry.
[196:52.35]Okay.
[196:54.82]Here we go.
[196:56.15]You usually walk fast and we got, by the way, Black Cherry.
[196:59.47]We're going to try this one.
[197:06.77]DMCA, what?
[197:10.64]If I get DMCA claimed for everybody, put your hands up, everybody stand up.
[197:17.58]That would be pretty weird, right?
[197:21.81]That would be strange.
[197:24.35]Okay, I gotta do this test.
[197:26.35]You usually walk fairly fast with small steps.
[197:32.39]Less fast head down.
[197:33.49]Isn't there a meme about this?
[197:36.41]No, there's a meme where it's like... It's like The Virgin, right?
[197:42.86]No, I... I walk fast with long... No, small steps.
[197:52.54]When talking to people, you stand with your arms folded.
[197:57.32]Have your hands clasped.
[197:59.48]Have one or both of your hands at your hips.
[198:02.10]Touch or push the person to whom you're talking to.
[198:05.74]Play with your ear or hair.
[198:07.83]That's a great- I just did a K-pop dance.
[198:10.49]Arms folded.
[198:11.43]Hands clasped.
[198:13.13]On your hips.
[198:13.97]Push away.
[198:15.07]Ear.
[198:15.55]Hair.
[198:15.77]Okay?
[198:17.19]Which one?
[198:22.84]I usually say I usually kind of like this like no I don't do that I definitely touch my hair all the time okay when relaxing you sit with your knees bent with your legs neatly side by side your legs I usually sit like with what I usually sit with like my legs crossed like this that
[198:54.42]But not like crossed crossed.
[198:55.86]Like... Like the shoe is this way.
[198:59.52]You know what I mean?
[199:00.42]Not like at the knee.
[199:01.52]I'm talking about like shoe kind of crossed over.
[199:03.16]Okay.
[199:07.62]When somebody really amuses you, you react with a laugh.
[199:10.26]But not... I usually laugh a little bit.
[199:12.12]I don't react that strongly.
[199:14.58]When you go to a party or a social gathering, you... Make a loud entrance so that everyone notices you.
[199:19.30]I don't want to do that.
[199:20.60]Make a quiet entrance looking around for someone you know.
[199:22.60]Yeah.
[199:25.12]I usually kind of be like, where the fuck is Mike?
[199:31.80]That's not Mike.
[199:32.36]And you have like a 30 rack and you're like, fuck these motherfuckers are going to drink all my beers.
[199:38.80]I know it.
[199:39.68]Mike.
[199:39.98]Alright.
[199:41.46]You're working very hard, concentrating hard and you're interrupted.
[199:46.14]You.
[199:46.40]I welcome the break.
[199:51.51]It's alright.
[199:53.47]Which of the following colors do you like the most?
[199:57.52]Green.
[199:59.95]Green and aqua.
[200:00.93]I like aqua.
[200:05.84]Green.
[200:08.53]When you are in a bed at night, in those last few moments before you go to sleep, you are... stretched out on your back, stretched out face down, on your side curled... Yeah.
[200:21.19]Like, I'm on my side, curled up.
[200:24.20]And I'm out.
[200:27.36]I feel like I would get suffocated.
[200:31.50]You often dream that you are... fighting or struggling, searching for something, flying or floating,
[200:38.99]Usually it is like fighting.
[200:41.52]Or like searching.
[200:50.00]It's usually searching.
[200:53.36]Okay, Dr. Phil.
[200:54.96]Quiz me.
[200:58.71]Result of your how do others perceive you quiz from Dr. Phil.
[201:03.08]You scored a total of 45.
[201:04.22]The lively center of attention.
[201:06.56]Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting.
[201:11.03]Someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to be let it go like all things should be.
[201:20.47]They also see you as a kind, considerate understanding.
[201:22.91]Someone who will always cheer them up and help them out.
[201:26.65]Hmm.
[201:33.54]Oh, wow, I didn't want to get 0 to 20.
[201:36.06]Didn't want to get 60 and up.
[201:39.34]Yeah, between 30 and 60 is where you want to be in Dr. Phil's quiz.
[201:44.70]I think that's pretty accurate.
[201:46.62]What's next?
[201:51.92]Put this on here for fun.
[201:52.84]I just, I wanted to put this on here for fun.
[201:54.94]Are you the imposter or just kind of sus?
[201:59.15]I, okay.
[202:02.13]hate the internet.
[202:03.65]I fucking hate this place.
[202:05.33]You know what I mean?
[202:07.77]Okay, uh, are you the imposter or are you just kind of sus?
[202:10.77]Alright, um.
[202:16.46]Sussed.
[202:23.12]Why now?
[202:23.52]I have to do this.
[202:24.48]I'm sorry.
[202:25.12]I have to do this.
[202:25.68]I have to be this way.
[202:26.76]I have to be this way.
[202:27.76]I have to be this way.
[202:30.18]By now you've probably heard of Among Us, a party game where you play a little astronaut crew member being hunted by an imposter.
[202:35.89]Or you play as the imposter.
[202:37.53]It's an incredibly fun and addictive way to lose friends.
[202:41.05]Anyway, here's a quiz to find out if you're the imposter or not, because you've been acting a little sus.
[202:46.21]Oh, you can see me doing that.
[202:47.15]I hate that.
[202:47.85]I hate when I do like a voice and you can see my face.
[202:49.49]Fuck off.
[202:54.77]What?
[202:55.40]Alright, fine.
[202:57.22]I'll do it quick!
[203:08.85]Satisfying.
[203:10.46]I don't know.
[203:11.06]Empty the garbage can.
[203:13.10]Where were you?
[203:13.84]Oh, I was at admin.
[203:17.28]Who do you think is sauce?
[203:18.31]I think it's red.
[203:22.03]Oh, you're not the imposter.
[203:23.13]It was red.
[203:23.77]I just played Among Us and won.
[203:26.73]Okay, moving on.
[203:30.02]Make a milkshake and we'll tell you which Among Us character you are.
[203:33.04]Okay, we're going to do it quick.
[203:33.84]We're going to do it quick.
[203:34.84]We'll start with... I thought this was going to be way, way funnier for people.
[203:38.82]Banana and... Banana and fudge brownie.
[203:43.91]And we're going to use coconut milk.
[203:46.03]And we're going to put cookies on it.
[203:48.81]And we're going to have a fun straw.
[203:51.61]I'm purple.
[203:52.29]Cool.
[203:52.61]That was fun.
[203:53.79]Okay.
[203:55.27]I don't want to take the fishing quiz.
[203:56.29]I don't care.
[203:57.82]Okay, picks up everyone's favorite.
[203:59.30]Okay, this is Looney Tunes characters.
[204:01.04]Looney Tunes, Looney Tunes, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.
[204:03.92]Looney Tunes character.
[204:04.68]Looney Tunes not among us anymore.
[204:09.69]This is going to tell me what Looney Tunes persona I am.
[204:13.55]Oh, yeah, this is the title of the stream.
[204:15.01]We finally got here.
[204:19.49]Pick something for breakfast.
[204:23.14]Cheers to that.
[204:24.76]Don't drink it fast.
[204:25.40]That's stupid.
[204:32.07]Scrambled eggs are breakfast sandwiches.
[204:34.83]Waffles are too messy and they're too heavy.
[204:36.71]Donuts are not good for you.
[204:39.27]Pancakes are too... You eat one and then you throw it away.
[204:42.61]It's not good.
[204:45.15]French toast sticks...
[204:49.03]Every time, look, those of you that want to talk shit about my pancake preference, how many times have you ever gone to get breakfast, talking to you, and you eat one pancake, and you go, oh that's enough, I'm done, oh there are, hold on, I can like fan through the rest of them, there's like four others here.
[205:12.38]Never.
[205:12.86]But then you got like the bacon and you have whatever else, the sides where you get toast and shit.
[205:16.38]Pancakes is too much.
[205:18.12]I'll take one pancake, please.
[205:20.64]One pancake this big.
[205:22.50]And I want it as a side.
[205:23.65]I don't want it as a main course.
[205:24.83]I want it as a side.
[205:26.89]Not the main thing.
[205:27.61]It's a breakfast sandwich.
[205:35.28]I'll pick something for lunch.
[205:39.28]Am I this boring?
[205:45.26]It's just sandwiches every day.
[205:46.40]Sandwiches all day.
[205:53.61]Probably tacos.
[205:54.19]I love tacos.
[205:55.59]Tacos.
[205:57.75]Food.
[205:58.45]Pick something for dinner.
[205:59.57]Okay.
[206:02.05]Pulled pork sandwich.
[206:02.93]Holy shit.
[206:03.48]That sounds pretty good right now.
[206:06.42]Pick a color.
[206:07.08]Green.
[206:09.60]Pick an animal.
[206:18.60]Pick a random word.
[206:20.50]Crazy.
[206:24.27]Pick a TV show.
[206:28.33]I like Spongebob.
[206:30.85]Phineas and Ferb, no.
[206:33.13]Scooby-Doo, eh.
[206:34.37]Rugrats, yes.
[206:35.34]Future Rom- These are actually- Okay, if you take out Phineas and Ferb, this is a hard one.
[206:44.64]Like, I can just, I could take Phineas and Ferb and just literally just go like that and I don't care.
[206:48.51]Uh, Bob's Burgers is, I think Bob's Burgers would be next in line for me just to be like, no.
[206:55.01]And then probably Scooby-Doo.
[206:56.46]So I've narrowed this down to SpongeBob, Futurama, and Rugrats.
[206:59.76]Rugrats, I grew up on this show.
[207:01.24]So, of course, I'm going to love it.
[207:03.66]Futurama is the best Matt Groening show.
[207:07.04]It's not the fucking Simpsons.
[207:08.00]And it's not that new one, whatever the fuck that one is.
[207:10.98]Enchantment or whatever.
[207:11.96]Not that one.
[207:13.20]It's this one.
[207:15.16]So it's probably going to come down to, because this is just nostalgia, rose-colored nostalgia eyeballs.
[207:20.51]SpongeBob and Futurama.
[207:27.65]It's Spongebob.
[207:29.77]No it's not.
[207:48.86]Uh, it's Spongebob.
[207:50.26]It's Spongebob.
[207:50.68]Pick a cookie!
[207:58.72]This is another process of elimination.
[208:02.58]Dark chocolate.
[208:05.92]It's gross.
[208:08.79]Don't like it.
[208:09.37]Chocolate chip, maybe.
[208:10.85]Peanut butter, unbelievable.
[208:16.77]Peanut butter chocolate chip, though.
[208:18.63]No, just chocolate chip.
[208:20.96]They gotta be soft.
[208:22.06]No crunchy cookies or I'll throw up.
[208:25.36]Like a movie genre.
[208:27.48]I don't like dark chocolate.
[208:28.24]It's too heavy.
[208:29.06]It's too much.
[208:29.42]It tastes almost like bitter and sour.
[208:32.36]I don't like the flavor.
[208:34.18]I would.
[208:34.50]You know, I like dark chocolate shavings on top of whipped cream that's on like a sundae.
[208:40.21]I know it's supposed to be.
[208:40.87]I know.
[208:41.29]But look, look, and some people like to drink like triple bold black coffee.
[208:46.43]And okay, that's cool.
[208:49.00]I just want something.
[208:50.04]I just want it a little lighter.
[208:51.56]Like I like a blonde roast.
[208:55.04]sometimes okay movie genre comedy take a picture of a bunny definitely the funny wide angle lens one a day of the week okay most people would say a weekend but I'm gonna have to give you I'm gonna flip this on you here I'm gonna say Thursday
[209:19.11]The reason why Thursday is the best day of the week is because Friday, yes, Friday's great.
[209:22.67]It's the end of the week and there's like the weekend.
[209:25.33]But Thursday lets you anticipate the Friday because you know on Friday you're going to feel great.
[209:31.67]So Thursday is like, alright, here we go.
[209:33.62]Friday's tomorrow.
[209:37.00]And it prepares your brain like Thursday's best day of the week.
[209:39.74]Here comes Friday.
[209:41.26]I'm looking forward to it.
[209:50.97]He's a jobless streamer.
[209:54.45]I'm a waiter, what are you talking about?
[209:57.47]I actually said this yesterday, that I was Daffy Duck.
[210:06.88]Um, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck, what's the difference?
[210:10.78]They both get angry and scream.
[210:13.68]Who's smarter?
[210:17.01]Okay, I think I'd rather be Donald Duck because Daffy Duck uses firearms.
[210:22.10]Doesn't he?
[210:23.38]I want to be Donald Duck.
[210:29.12]Daffy Duck's like crazy.
[210:33.14]Isn't there episodes where Daffy Duck like shoots Bugs Bunny?
[210:38.77]Donald never does that.
[210:39.55]He just kind of freaks out and spins around in a circle and people ignore him.
[210:46.46]I'm a Donald.
[210:47.24]I'm a Donald Duck.
[210:54.01]Donald killed someone in Kingdom Hearts.
[210:55.95]Okay.
[211:05.83]Okay.
[211:08.15]Okay, if you can get a 7 out of 8 on this horse facts test, you are a horse girl.
[211:14.12]No.
[211:15.82]He did it.
[211:16.46]He did what?
[211:20.32]It's time for more horse-themed quizzes.
[211:28.35]Horse girl Jerm of Omega Lo.
[211:29.99]Why?
[211:34.47]Donald...
[211:37.76]Please play Hivemind.
[211:38.78]I'm here for a while, man.
[211:42.02]I'm not leaving anytime soon.
[211:43.98]Alright.
[211:47.08]So what?
[211:47.40]This is just how much I know about horses?
[211:50.68]What is the average lifespan of a horse?
[211:54.27]I don't have any goddamn idea at all.
[211:56.45]I have no idea.
[211:58.33]You could have told me that fish live longer than horses, like a goldfish, and I'd be like, I guess.
[212:02.33]That makes sense.
[212:02.87]They're huge.
[212:04.41]It's probably this.
[212:04.95]14 to 19.
[212:05.21]I would say 14 to 19 years.
[212:09.21]Wrong.
[212:09.81]25 to 30.

[214:04.67]You got one out of eight right.
[214:07.05]You are not a horse girl.
[214:11.54]I mean, someone's got to keep horse girls in check.

[214:22.42]Wait, what?

[214:32.99]What even... What's even left?
[214:35.56]Okay, this is, you have 10 questions to prove you're not stupid.
