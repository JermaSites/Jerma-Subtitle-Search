[00:07.97]What the hell are you doing?
[00:09.65]You dropped your burger on the ground there.
[00:13.11]You dropped your burger on the ground.
[00:15.78]Hey, have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Brothers 2?
[00:20.74]It's pretty cool.
[00:21.94]You see, the main character, Super Mario, he goes like this.
[00:26.36]And he gets it, and he, where's the game?
[00:28.48]That doesn't even hurt.
[00:29.22]That doesn't even hurt.
[00:32.04]Where's the gun?
[00:33.51]Give me that gun.
[00:35.48]Give me this gun.
[00:36.62]Give me that gun.
[00:38.28]I win.
[00:39.86]You really like this joke.
[00:42.94]You got me.
[00:43.60]Today is your unlucky day, motherfucker.
[00:47.78]Yeah.
[00:49.00]Yeah.
[00:50.18]Oh, yeah.
[00:50.94]Gotcha.
[00:51.68]Gotcha, motherfucker.
[00:52.36]I don't think that's going to stop being funny.
[00:58.74]What's wrong?
[00:59.92]Having some trouble?
[01:01.85]Come on now.
[01:02.64]What do you got?
[01:03.18]You got a pistol?
[01:03.68]I got a pistol.
[01:04.12]I'm gonna shoot you with this pistol.
[01:06.34]Duck.
[01:07.14]Jump.
[01:09.14]Get right.
[01:10.16]I mean, get right.
[01:13.84]It's actually kind of hard.
[01:15.35]It's hard to like hit B and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time.
[01:20.43]Watch out.
[01:20.73]I got a shotgun.
[01:21.29]I got one too.
[01:23.31]I'm gonna blast you.
[01:24.27]You're gonna blast me?
[01:25.69]I'm gonna throw it.
[01:26.43]You think you're gonna blast me?
[01:28.20]Well, I'm not gonna now.
[01:28.88]I don't have a shotgun anymore.
[01:29.76]Come chase me.
[01:31.63]What?
[01:34.23]Come chase me?
[01:35.79]I don't know.
[01:36.91]Come chase me.
[01:37.79]You're the one with the gun.
[01:39.12]Chase me.
[01:40.92]We're gonna do it just like they used to do in the old times.
[01:44.42]Back to back, ten paces.
[01:47.82]Turn around.
[01:49.16]Okay.
[01:50.10]In ten paces.
[01:51.72]Go.
[01:52.63]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
[01:59.65]Die!
[01:59.85]Die!
[02:02.00]Mishcalculation.
[02:02.60]My die was like, eight syllables.
[02:05.75]That's the fucking Earth- I just found the Earthworm Jim gun, dude.
[02:08.41]Dude, look!
[02:08.95]Look!
[02:09.33]Look!
[02:09.59]This is the gun from Earthworm Jim!
[02:11.05]Cool, huh?
[02:13.16]Cool!
[02:13.88]Duck game!
[02:14.52]On Steam!
[02:15.32]Currently part of the Steam sale!
[02:16.90]Pick it up today!
[02:17.78]You're gonna have fun with all your friends!
[02:20.04]Like this guy!
[02:20.82]He's my friend.
[02:21.74]But is he really, though?
[02:22.77]I don't know.
[02:23.37]Could he be?
[02:23.79]I have no idea.
[02:24.71]Friends!
[02:25.69]I love friends!
[02:26.33]Fuck this video!
[02:27.13]Fuck this whole thing!
[02:28.59]This whole thing sucks!
[02:30.05]You know, when I sit up here and stare at this... red beam... I think about my life.
[02:37.16]And where I've been, and where I'll go.
[02:40.62]And what... aliens... Are we the aliens to aliens?
[02:52.20]I just want to watch the world burn!
[02:54.58]That's a Batman quote.
[02:58.48]I wonder how long this recording has been.
[03:01.99]Hello there.
[03:02.77]Welcome to the shoe shop.
[03:05.47]Eh.
[03:06.45]Okay, so I have this pair of shoes for only $12.
[03:12.03]I'll take them.
[03:12.97]Okay, good.
[03:14.14]Ah, yes, my old nemesis.
[03:16.64]The hamburger head.
[03:18.40]Those of you that know who he is, he's a dastardly villain.
[03:22.16]And he must be destroyed!
[03:23.16]You have to come down here.
[03:25.96]Yeah, I know.
[03:27.40]I will eventually.
[03:28.24]I'm doing my monologue.
[03:29.68]It's incredibly important to the story arc of my character!
[03:36.00]I seriously don't know how many more of these I can even tolerate as a person.
[03:40.80]That's the gun from... That's the moon gun.
[03:43.22]I'm gonna catch it in my mouth!
[03:44.96]No, no, don't die, don't die!
[03:47.28]I'm gonna catch it in my mouth!
[03:54.03]There he is!
[03:54.63]Ladies and gentlemen, that's the guy that hired my character!
[03:56.81]I have to go to kill that guy!
[03:57.97]It's part of my character storyline!
[04:06.55]Bastard!
[04:08.16]Alright, so... Your first day on the job here at Edwards Construction.
[04:12.80]You gotta be careful.
[04:16.60]Told you to be careful.
[04:20.19]And that's when she told me to go to school.
[04:25.47]She wanted to see me at Iowa.
[04:28.49]You're really fucking this up, aren't you?
[04:32.48]Are we the aliens to that planet?
[04:36.16]Could be.
[04:37.70]Makes sense, in my opinion.
[04:40.30]Although, a more existential way to look at it is probably like this.
[04:52.98]Man, can you believe Carol?
[04:54.33]Carol in accounting?
[04:55.83]Man, she really gave me the riot accident.
[05:01.35]Yeah, you do.
[05:03.01]I don't know why you've been doing that.
[05:04.57]Seems kind of expensive.
[05:11.20]Alright, I'm ready.
[05:13.66]Okay, I'm gonna catch her in my mouth.
[05:24.84]Hey, I just want to say congratulations on being number one.
[05:30.02]You don't talk to me!
[05:31.55]You deserve that trophy.
[05:32.55]You're second place, I win!
