[ve:61.1.100]

[00:03.14]How are you doing?
[00:09.87]Alright, let's hope this works.
[00:14.01]It was a huge pain in the ass to get this to work.
[00:19.66]I will tell you.
[00:20.22]I had to install and download so much stuff to physically get this to operate.
[00:35.42]Make sure you guys can hear it.
[00:40.37]I think you should be able to hear it.
[00:43.02]Let's do a hearing test.
[00:45.33]Can you guys hear this?
[00:48.60]Hey, I think you can.
[00:53.37]Alright, are we ready?
[00:54.41]This is Dracula 3.
[00:55.50]To give you a quick recap, this is the third in the series, obviously.
[00:58.84]It's taken me two or three months to play this one.
[01:04.53]And again, it's because the game was a monumental pain in the ass to get to work.
[01:09.10]Spoilers, we don't do those here.
[01:10.68]You can go watch all the VODs.
[01:13.78]But here we go.
[01:14.86]Dracula 3.
[01:16.81]Return of Dracula 3.
[01:35.19]The path of the Dr.- How did the last one even end?
[01:44.16]Okay, that's the whole opening cut.
[01:45.56]I was waiting for something a little more elaborate.
[01:48.75]But that's okay.
[01:50.79]Uh... We're just- We were stuck in a box.
[01:55.02]I'm gonna have a recap of that.
[01:56.08]I don't know.
[02:00.99]New game.
[02:01.71]I don't think this matters.
[02:03.83]Also, I want to make this really clear.
[02:05.35]This, this game notoriously is unbearable.
[02:13.84]The puzzles are unbearable.
[02:15.16]Sometimes it's like one pixel that you can't even see.
[02:17.70]So I am completely open.
[02:20.96]Somebody is going to probably, I'm going to, I'm going to need help.
[02:23.01]We're going to do this together.
[02:24.05]I don't care about like beating this normally.
[02:28.51]I don't.
[02:30.89]Where's my mouse?
[02:33.04]My mouse is currently locked into the screen.
[02:35.92]So, uh... Oh, there it is.
[02:37.88]Okay.
[02:41.40]Let me get back in the mod chat.
[02:45.19]Uh... The mods already have the walkthrough open, by the way.
[02:50.33]Alright, here we go.
[02:52.77]Let me turn it up a little bit, because we want the sound effects.
[02:55.16]We want the weird shit.
[03:00.86]Let's begin.
[03:13.71]I woke up in a box.
[03:32.20]Okay, wait, we already saw that, but anyways.
[03:34.27]This is the Vatican.
[03:35.36]Is it the fear of death that is tormenting you?
[03:38.58]The fear of suffocating, monseigneur.
[03:41.04]At Caparero, a shell buried my unit.
[03:44.33]I was the lone survivor.
[03:46.75]God spared your life.
[03:48.77]May he bring peace to your soul.
[03:51.16]His word guides me through my trials.
[03:53.74]After my nightmare, I opened the Bible and read this passage from Isaiah.
[03:57.89]Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
[04:03.67]Ah, no.
[04:04.80]You use the Bible to interpret your dreams.
[04:08.04]Please, don't sink to superstition.
[04:10.61]Your Eminence, since God rules the world, nothing happens by chance.
[04:16.54]Everything is the expression of His will.
[04:18.71]Everything must have a sense.
[04:21.09]And it is not in the power of man to discover it.
[04:24.21]Arno, your hunger for answers leads you astray.
[04:27.44]Please, let's get back to the matter at hand.
[04:30.10]Is this before or after what happened last time?
[04:32.49]...in the bishopric of Alba Iula.
[04:35.99]In Transylvania?
[04:37.52]The region has just been annexed by Romania, has it not?
[04:41.32]You be sure.
[04:42.50]They speak mostly Romanian there, as well as a little Hungarian and Jerma.
[04:46.45]Three languages you know well.
[04:48.86]You will investigate the case of Martha Calugaro, a physician and scientist who died a few months ago.
[04:56.22]And we're already investigating?
[04:57.91]The postulator of her cause has presented solid arguments to justify a rapid process.
[05:05.22]Naturally, this mustn't influence you, but you know your duty, don't you, Mr. Devil's Advocate?
[05:19.86]Okay.
[05:19.98]This is a completely new story?
[05:22.73]It's not the same guy from the first one?
[05:24.80]Is it the same Dracula?
[05:28.52]Wait, is it different Dracula?
[05:34.21]No, it's gotta be the same Dracula, right?
[05:41.80]Okay.
[05:51.81]This is not the time to take the train.
[05:53.97]I still have things to do here.
[05:59.01]Okay, I go.
[06:00.14]Before anything else, let's try to find that inn where I reserved my room.
[06:04.00]Alright, gotta find the inn.
[06:10.91]Wait, I gotta tip.
[06:13.77]Okay, I found the inn already.
[06:17.95]I don't think I can do anything else.
[06:18.97]We're going right in.
[06:24.02]Garlic.
[06:24.46]What a delicious looking basket.
[06:27.05]I see the inn's kitchen lacks for nothing.
[06:29.63]Which, for that matter, is astonishing in this ruined country.
[06:34.45]It does look kind of good.
[06:36.62]There's a basket of garlic and bread.
[06:39.32]You actually can't go wrong there.
[06:41.90]What's in there?
[06:42.24]That's the outbox for the mail.
[06:44.24]Okay, what's in there?
[06:44.91]What's that?
[06:45.23]That's the outbox for the mail.
[06:47.73]What's that thing?
[06:50.05]Alright, first weird character of the night.
[06:51.41]Let's see.
[06:55.07]Hello, ma'am.
[06:56.11]I'm Father Arno Moriani.
[06:58.72]Kind of looks like the character from Towerborn that I made.
[07:00.52]You're the one who's come from Rome about Martha.
[07:03.46]Hello, Father.
[07:04.29]Your room's waiting.
[07:06.71]First one on the right at the top of the staircase.
[07:09.95]You already got a letter.
[07:11.64]I put it on your table.
[07:13.48]Thank you, ma'am.
[07:14.68]Osanna, Father.
[07:16.06]Call me Osanna.
[07:17.73]It's the name they christened me with.
[07:22.11]Did you know Dr. Martha Alugaro well?
[07:25.47]Oh, yeah.
[07:26.55]Really well.
[07:28.03]She saved my kid, you see.
[07:30.42]He was real sick.
[07:32.12]She sent him to the seashore.
[07:34.60]The doctor put it like this.
[07:36.66]Osana, your boy's got to change climates.
[07:40.59]And if it'll make the difference for you, I'll pay the expenses.
[07:45.24]That woman was truly a saint.
[07:48.13]They said, what is the accent?
[07:49.15]I often go pray on her grave.
[07:51.27]I don't know.
[07:51.83]I thought it was Boston at first.
[07:53.73]Young Master Peckmister told me he'd sure like to meet you.
[07:57.60]Mr. Peckmister?
[07:58.18]It sounds like she's telling you this through a voice mail.
[08:00.66]Yeah.
[08:01.57]Janos Peckmister.
[08:03.07]He's one of my lodgers.
[08:04.99]He got the room across from yours.
[08:07.35]He's in the parlor right now.
[08:09.30]Very well.
[08:10.38]I'll go say hello now.
[08:12.66]Okay.
[08:14.20]There's no point.
[08:15.36]Oh, there is always a point to ring a fun bell.
[08:18.87]You dick.
[08:24.76]Alright, let's go.
[08:30.50]Oh boy.
[08:31.40]Okay, there's an actual... I don't want to make anybody sick.
[08:41.62]Hello, father.
[08:42.88]Delighted to meet you.
[08:46.30]Who's this guy?
[08:47.76]That's a huge book.
[08:48.76]That book is way too big.
[08:53.69]I'm Janos Pechmester, assistant professor in the medieval history department at the University of Alba Iula.
[09:00.74]Father Arno Moriani, the Congregation of Rights.
[09:04.13]I won't ask you what you've come here for.
[09:06.75]The whole village is aware of it.
[09:08.67]And you?
[09:09.93]What brings you to Vladiviste?
[09:12.08]I'm verifying some locations and doing a little excavation at the Castle of Twilight on the heights near the village.
[09:19.37]That must be fascinating.
[09:20.91]Is the structure well preserved?
[09:23.26]Before the war, it wasn't perfect.
[09:26.90]Unfortunately, it suffered enormously during the 1916 counteroffensive.
[09:35.77]We can hope so.
[09:39.08]I was in the war as a priest medic in the Italian army.
[09:41.97]This kind of sounds like a table read?
[09:47.80]No, it sounds fine.
[09:54.25]Hey, don't disrespect Dracula 3, alright?
[09:57.44]We are here as but humble observers of this game.
[10:06.38]Why is he so itchy?
[10:11.07]Okay, Castle Twilight.
[10:20.75]Okay.
[10:41.70]How do you leave a conversation like this, right?
[10:44.59]I've already stood here for too long.
[10:46.51]If you stand here for too long, you have to bring something else up to make it seem like you actually want it to stay.
[10:54.98]I have to say something else, right?
[10:58.55]What about all these books?
[11:08.23]That didn't really need a cutscene.
[11:12.63]There's gonna be some puzzle with this bullshit.
[11:29.93]Am I gonna pick every one of these books and we're gonna get a different cutscene of him reacting to the book?
[11:36.11]Wait a minute.
[11:36.91]What about 1903?
[11:43.50]I got to go through every single one.
[11:47.86]Nothing much happened that year.
[11:49.25]Okay, what about 1904?
[11:50.39]It'd be better for me to focus my research instead of randomly consulting documents.
[11:55.07]I hit the cool down period.
[11:57.71]Nope.
[12:05.72]Oh, we got something in 1905.
[12:09.22]The Vesanese Foundation opens a dispensary in Vladivostok.
[12:17.99]Vapes, flour, and oil.
[12:23.32]I really tried for that one.
[12:28.95]It just kind of fell out.
[12:34.02]And how can I not say edibles?
[12:35.89]What's wrong with me?
[12:37.17]Okay, so the new Vladivostok dispensary will benefit from the latest advances in science.
[12:42.12]The foundation administrators have entrusted Dr. Martha Kalugarul with managing the establishment.
[12:48.51]This modern young woman of renowned competence will have the mission of caring for the population while pursuing ambitious research in the area of blood administration.
[13:00.08]With support from the Vene... the Vesanese Foundation, the Miskaya Corporation has just completed the construction of a factory producing electricity with the help of water wheels.
[13:10.09]In the course of a year, domestic power service will be provided to all the populated areas.
[13:14.02]Cool.
[13:18.06]Are you fucking kidding me?
[13:21.23]Well, hold on a second.
[13:21.99]Let me get my glasses.
[13:24.09]The new Laleviste dispensary will benefit from the late... Wait, actually, there might be stuff in here.
[13:31.32]12th grader, by the way.
[13:36.84]I've read that pretty much... Yeah, I can't pronounce an Italian name.
[13:44.39]Anything in here that's weird?
[13:46.25]This reminds me of Blueprints.
[13:48.50]Do you remember that?
[13:49.24]Anybody that played Blueprints...
[13:51.14]The amount of, of psychotic.
[13:53.87]Like, do this on every single thing you've ever, ever picked up.
[13:58.57]Go like this.
[13:59.65]Gain the entire thing.
[14:00.68]It doesn't matter if it takes an hour.
[14:06.99]And that's it, okay.
[14:09.35]All the documents that you find are archived.
[14:10.73]It would be necessary to view them at any time.
[14:12.69]Right click, then press documents.
[14:14.60]Oh, cool.
[14:15.44]Okay.
[14:17.26]I just have a Bible?!
[14:18.26]!
[14:23.98]Oh my fucking god, this is 3,353 pages!
[14:29.15]Is the whole Holy Bible in the game?
[14:32.16]Oh my god.
[14:39.51]Dude, open the book at random.
[14:48.62]You will discover wise words, sometimes even predictions, which are strikingly in tune with your situation.
[14:54.65]Click on the button as many times as needed.
[14:56.47]So this is the hint?
[15:03.86]Okay, I ain't reading the entire Holy Bible right now.
[15:06.93]I have to check into the hotel room, guys.
[15:10.53]Looking pretty damn good.
[15:11.64]Okay, looking snappy.
[15:22.67]Hello?
[15:26.74]I'm not reading the Bible before I check into the hotel room.
[15:31.16]First door on the right.
[15:33.65]Sink in the room?
[15:42.48]Is there a bathroom?
[15:44.24]Where do you go to the bathroom?
[15:46.22]Okay.
[15:53.77]This oak wardrobe is very solid.
[15:56.26]Ooh, read the whole Bible.
[16:00.27]A missive from the diocese of Alba Iula.
[16:03.82]It concerns Martha.
[16:07.01]Alright, so open it.
[16:16.27]Don't skip all the way to six.
[16:18.37]Oh, we're missing... This is... Okay.
[16:21.18]Birth of... Lucaris of Martha Kulugarul, the offspring of a very old Catholic family, offered at the age of 10.
[16:27.85]She's brought up by an unmarried aunt.
[16:31.07]In 1891, she passes an examination organized by the Vesanici Foundation and receives a grant to pursue medical studies.
[16:41.92]Okay.
[16:42.04]Then about 10 years later, she's the first Romanian woman admitted to the examination for the Royal hospital internship.
[16:49.08]Then one year later, she passes the experimental physiology qualifying exam.
[16:56.23]Okay.
[16:58.10]Did a bunch of stuff.
[17:00.36]You won a prize for the use of sodium citrate in blood conservation.
[17:07.13]Miss Martha Caligula and Professor Von Kruger after a conference given at the Bucharest Academy of Sciences.
[17:16.24]Okay, if I just did this and it went, just screamed at me, that would have been insane.
[17:22.44]Alright, place your bets if Professor Von Kruger is evil.
[17:33.82]okay threat of war fighting rages around the village occurs the equal devotion for the combatants of both camps she traverses battlefields okay brother comes with the aid of vladivista inhabitants okay there's a war exhausted by the tough work that took on herself here mother died at her residence one of her last good deeds was to pay her own funds the trip to the sea of a sickly child
[18:01.75]Her gravest subject is the object of immediate devotion.
[18:05.40]Okay.
[18:08.28]So that's a myth about Martha.
[18:09.42]This biography cannot be objective, of course.
[18:12.19]But it helps to capture Martha's personality.
[18:14.85]It's about time I seriously started my investigation.
[18:19.30]Okay.
[18:19.42]And that investigation is... Where is Dracula?
[18:28.48]No, no, no.
[18:30.08]I want to go to bed.
[18:32.21]I don't want to talk to this guy.
[18:37.72]You can't smoke in a hotel room.
[18:38.84]You get fucking thrown out for that.
[18:42.28]It's a knock.
[18:50.73]Here's me.
[18:51.22]No smoking.
[18:53.84]Because if this is what you do, you... You make like...
[19:00.14]And then you leave.
[19:07.25]Should I go to bed?
[19:17.65]He ain't gonna hit us with the sleigh right now.
[19:20.05]He's not gonna hit us with the sleigh, right?
[19:22.79]That's un-fucking-believable.
[19:29.00]Okay, uh, if you feel lost, take a few steps in order to clear your mind, then review your objectives, but do not follow them blindly.
[19:37.55]Contact the parish priest and talk to him about Martha.
[19:41.21]Visit Martha's grave, and we- Okay, so we're just gonna go.
[19:44.62]What is the save button?
[19:47.52]Very important, because I'm gonna do it literally right now.
[19:56.05]Yeah, like, I- I'm not starting over.
[20:01.55]Okay, so we gotta go to the grave.
[20:11.54]Use the phone?
[20:12.42]Oh, okay, I can use the phone.
[20:17.39]Anything else I can do here though?
[20:24.45]That poor person.
[20:25.80]I shouldn't have knocked on their door for no reason.
[20:30.16]Alright, let's call somebody.
[20:35.53]Who the hell did I just call?
[20:36.90]Like, fucking Elmo?
[20:39.34]A Jack in the Box?
[20:40.72]Like, who am I even calling?
[20:43.11]Oh, it's the operator.
[20:43.95]Okay.
[20:53.06]You can just call the Vatican.
[21:03.65]okay it's the vatican system this is cardinal felicio began this is father arno moriani delighted to hear your voice so Mr. the pope on the other end of the line what's the weather like in transylvania stormy but that doesn't bother me it gives the countryside a kind of tragic coloring my goodness arno you haven't changed what can I do for you okay
[21:35.00]Can I contact the Diocese of Alba Lula directly?
[21:38.93]No, it's better that I contact them if need be.
[21:44.59]Okay, what's the reason for such haste in the investigation of Martha's case?
[21:47.26]The Diocese of Alba Lula let it be known that the canonization of a local native would enable the Catholics, who are in minority in Transylvania, to reaffirm their identity with regard to the Orthodox.
[21:59.43]This can be very important in a nation under construction.
[22:02.47]That's why the process began so quickly.
[22:06.12]Yeah, it actually does look like the new Pope from Chicago.
[22:11.79]That is really weird.
[22:13.21]Oh, there he goes.
[22:17.33]Okay.
[22:20.52]Alright, well that's some good info.
[22:25.90]Now we gotta go to the grave.
[22:28.95]I'm not gonna be able to get over this shit, honestly.
[22:31.01]Every time I see it.
[22:33.90]Uh...
[22:39.18]So let's go.
[22:39.76]Let's just go.
[22:40.26]I can go this way.
[22:49.93]To skip a line of dialog, press the spacebar.
[22:58.20]Actually really good to know.
[22:59.08]Okay.
[23:04.16]Look around for items.
[23:04.96]I want to make sure I collect stuff.
[23:08.39]I mean yeah that's that's terrible but that I thought I was gonna get jumped by like a fucking monster or something going this way
[23:41.31]My heart is racing.
[23:46.98]Here you will receive neither glory nor wealth, but the rest of the body and the peace of the soul.
[23:56.51]Oh boy.
[23:57.20]This is where shit gets fucked.
[24:06.73]Who's this?
[24:08.43]Hey, sir.
[24:18.13]This is weird.
[24:24.08]Okay.
[24:33.69]Could I speak to the parish priest?
[24:41.09]Darn it.
[24:48.02]Can we contact him?
[24:50.50]I'm sorry.
[25:11.27]sure I knew her she was a darn good doctor with all due respect and she had guts she saved a lot of folks during the war and then young ariel that everybody was sure had an evil eye cast on him that ain't all
[25:30.53]yes she works miracles explain that to me work for her I hope this guy doesn't die he probably is gonna die though let me tell you she heals even better since she died that's why people go to her grave and light candles there I'll leave you you seem to have a great deal of work well with all due respect father I gotta move the old ones to make room for the newcomers
[26:03.23]Well, it was nice to meet you.
[26:06.46]There's somebody else over here.
[26:08.60]Hold on, there's a grave.
[26:24.12]Are these cutscenes just showing the guy...
[26:29.08]contemplating in deep thought.
[26:30.74]I keep feeling we're going to get something from them, but we get a whole lot of nothing from them.
[26:36.67]Hey!
[26:43.68]Oh, God.
[26:44.26]Another one of these.
[26:45.56]They just, like, walk up to you so strangely.
[26:48.58]Hello.
[26:49.42]My name is Ianelle.
[26:50.87]Hello, son.
[26:52.05]I am Father Arno.
[26:53.48]You're the one who's come to get Martha into heaven?
[26:56.53]Oh, I'm not the one who decides that, you know.
[26:59.81]I'm just here to question people to find out who she was.
[27:05.42]She gave injections.
[27:07.44]When I was little, that scared me.
[27:09.67]But she always gave me candy afterwards.
[27:12.61]She was nice.
[27:14.27]And she's even nicer since she's dead.
[27:16.38]Is that so?
[27:18.14]Explain that to me.
[27:19.42]She protects people.
[27:21.20]When you go to some bad spot in the middle of the night, you have to repeat three times, Saint Martha, protect me, and nothing will happen to you.
[27:31.16]The gravedigger told me that.
[27:33.10]And also, when you burn a candle on her grave, you can make a wish.
[27:38.01]I asked Martha to send me a friend to play with.
[27:42.35]I had one but he died and then another one but he left so now I'm bored Jesus okay oh don't get into any trouble son I asked Martha to Martha our guardian angel parishioners of vladivista it's closed
[28:11.62]In memory of poor Ann Mouteno who perished in 1840 in a terrible fire.
[28:17.30]This still covers a child whom death took away too soon.
[28:22.05]OK, anything else?
[28:26.04]I guess I thought the kid was gone.
[28:27.38]I was like oh shit that kid was a ghost.
[28:36.71]Dude, imagine getting Fabio'd like that.
[28:40.68]You guys have seen that before when Fabio was on a roller coaster and he got hit in the face by a bird?
[28:45.20]It's one of the most fucked up things ever.
[28:49.81]Check your toupee.
[28:50.97]Your toupee is gone.
[28:56.04]It was a goose?
[28:58.31]Yeah, dude.
[29:01.62]It's so, like, it's so bad.
[29:03.48]His face is covered in blood.
[29:06.78]It's fucked up.
[29:17.54]Can I get up there?
[29:27.22]We've got to find her.
[29:27.84]Where's her grave?
[29:28.88]Did I miss it?
[29:31.20]We can go this way.
[29:40.01]Was that her grave back here?
[29:41.03]Not this one, right?
[29:49.86]Oh, okay.
[29:53.86]I visited it.
[29:56.81]OK, we can call we can call the the church now, right?
[30:08.41]Oh my God, that's so high up.
[30:18.81]Didn't even go to the church.
[30:19.73]I don't think I could climb up there.
[30:29.25]Oh, here's the dispensary.
[30:36.88]Okay, coming in!
[30:39.46]What the fuck?!
[30:47.75]Sorry, my noise gate might have screwed that up.
[30:50.47]I'm sorry.
[30:52.86]I thought that was a huge dog.
[30:57.38]Hello, Miss.
[30:58.40]I'm Father Arno Moriani.
[31:00.53]I am Dr. Maria Florescu.
[31:02.90]Have you come from the Vatican, Father?
[31:05.12]Ah, I see that news travels quickly.
[31:08.01]I'd like to know more about her.
[31:12.52]Okay, first name, basis.
[31:24.07]What do you know?
[31:36.34]I've read the research she published.
[31:38.66]I also know about her through what the villagers say, and from the traces she left in this house.
[31:43.99]She led an austere life and worked a great deal.
[31:46.69]Does this double audio?
[31:47.49]Her only distraction was photography.
[31:49.52]All her equipment is still here.
[31:52.02]She sounds like she's an android.
[31:53.44]That's like a robot voice from Fallout.
[31:56.94]I feel like I'm playing Fallout 4.
[32:01.79]What brought you to work here?
[32:04.24]She's a simp.
[32:06.34]Okay.
[32:26.77]The members of the parish say they were cured after praying to Saint Martha.
[32:30.49]In fact, I did observe several spontaneous cures.
[32:33.53]But, you know, this sort of thing happens relatively frequently.
[32:37.78]Spontaneous does not necessarily mean miraculous.
[32:41.32]Everything is possible.
[32:42.85]Don't hesitate to come back if you think I can help you.
[32:45.63]Or I can stop by the inn if you prefer.
[32:47.29]She's curing people.
[32:47.79]You will always be welcome.
[32:49.35]But please, don't go to the trouble.
[32:51.44]I'll come by again.
[32:52.62]The run's really itchy.
[32:54.34]Look, that was the second time I've seen somebody itch.
[32:58.39]What's that?
[33:01.05]This isn't the right time.
[33:03.80]This isn't the right time.
[33:05.18]I can't wash my hands in somebody's house?
[33:06.96]I guess that is kind of weird.
[33:09.56]This isn't the right time.
[33:10.70]I can't just start cooking food?
[33:13.03]This isn't the right time.
[33:14.05]I can't, like, poke the fire to make it warmer in here?
[33:18.85]Okay, would it be weird if I were to turn this way?
[33:22.28]Be like, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, so have you seen Martha?
[33:24.98]And just start washing my hands over here.
[33:26.79]Would that be weird?
[33:32.56]Is it like, hey, do you mind if I wash my hands in the sink?
[33:35.54]I feel like if you ask, it's fine.
[33:41.55]Got to be something in here I can grab.
[33:47.76]Can I use your phone?
[33:51.55]You got a phone?
[33:53.59]Why?
[33:55.13]There's going to be some fucked up stuff in there.
[33:59.82]Guaranteed.
[34:02.55]OK, well.
[34:04.43]Uh, it's I did.
[34:05.29]I got everything.
[34:07.78]Is she telling me to leave?
[34:12.61]I'm getting kicked out.
[34:17.86]Oh Dracula.
[34:28.03]Don't call me again.
[34:34.42]Can I go in there?
[34:44.97]I don't think I can even go over there.
[34:49.69]This whole town is definitely vampires.
[34:52.48]That's why they're all itchy and stuff.
[34:57.64]Where am I going?
[34:59.41]Bro, where are you going?
[35:01.15]I wanted to go back to the inn and call the priest.
[35:02.77]Why did I... I walked 10 miles!
[35:11.58]I just wanted to call the priest!
[35:26.08]Go back.
[35:27.88]It was nighttime when I left.
[35:38.28]Oh boy, I just threw two days in the trash.
[35:45.69]I just want to call the priest.
[35:49.99]There it is.
[36:02.46]Always hanging around outside, if that ain't a shame.
[36:06.05]Of course, he's got no more parents.
[36:08.55]Lives with his uncle, barely takes care of him.
[36:11.97]Talk about that.
[36:13.45]It's like flickery in here.
[36:14.39]Is that the candle or is that the game?
[36:16.72]A lovely girl.
[36:19.22]But she's got a way about her, if you see what I mean.
[36:22.34]You can tell right off she's not from around here.
[36:24.56]Okay.
[36:27.67]Oh, it is just that, I think.
[36:32.79]Alright, let's make a phone call.
[36:40.74]Number, please.
[36:43.34]I'd like to call Costanza.
[36:44.64]Hold the line.
[36:47.05]You're connected.
[36:52.24]Greenleaf Rest Home.
[36:53.58]Good day.
[36:54.34]Could I speak to Father Gregorio Nagescu, please?
[36:57.24]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[36:59.67]One moment, I'll see.
[37:03.31]It'll get an avatar for this father?
[37:05.21]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[37:07.68]I belong to the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and I'm investigating the case of the late Martha Caligaro.
[37:14.22]Ah, yes.
[37:15.91]I'm aware of that.
[37:18.81]Okay.
[37:19.95]Uh, what do you think of her?
[37:21.05]She was a good Christian.
[37:23.40]Courageous, charitable.
[37:26.18]And she attended Mass regularly.
[37:29.82]I appreciated her a great deal.
[37:33.77]Okay, well, do you think she's a saint?
[37:37.46]Some of my parishioners think so.
[37:40.80]The diocese realized that and asked for the case to be opened.
[37:46.38]Myself, I don't know.
[37:49.73]Things like that are way beyond me.
[37:51.37]What a mystery.
[37:53.29]Oh my god, I am so sorry.
[37:55.13]Not very good, actually, since you ask.
[38:00.44]But what good does it do to talk about it?
[38:03.71]Prayer is my only comfort.
[38:06.31]Goodbye, Father Gregorio.
[38:07.86]I wish you a good rest.
[38:09.14]Nobody's telling me anything about this.
[38:10.56]They're all being so vague.
[38:14.43]I think I've done enough for this first day at Vladivostok.
[38:17.92]It's time to go to bed.
[38:23.89]Let's go to bed.
[38:33.21]Wow, I'm dead tired.
[38:35.45]Got to go directly to bed.
[38:37.17]He sounds tired too.
[38:43.42]Uh oh.
[38:45.62]Uh oh.
[38:52.99]Yohan!
[38:54.47]Luciana!
[38:56.09]Yohan!
[38:57.10]May I come up?
[38:58.62]Come.
[39:11.19]This is an incredible intrusion.
[39:30.56]Oh shit!
[39:32.79]Hey!
[39:34.23]Okay.
[39:41.55]How did I... I wasn't seen?
[39:48.40]Oh, thank goodness.
[39:50.26]It was just the shadow people.
[39:52.83]That couldn't have been actual people.
[39:55.57]That was just shadow people.
[39:58.39]Thank goodness.
[40:13.78]Okay, we're good.
[40:17.06]Uh... I can't even look at it.
[40:27.34]I have to look at this menu every time I hit right click.
[40:30.48]This is so fucked.
[40:33.99]Okay.
[40:35.11]I need to go to the castle.
[40:40.17]Something to tell me?
[40:42.38]What is it?
[40:49.52]Mr. Stefan Luka, a reporter from the city arrived here this morning.
[40:54.23]He's in the parlor.
[40:55.63]He sort of told me to kind of tell you he'd like to talk to you.
[40:59.73]A reporter?
[41:00.72]Very well, I'll go.
[41:04.04]Wait, Father.
[41:05.28]I also wanted to tell you... Take this as a melee weapon.
[41:07.44]The brook... I have to make up the room to the right of yours for Mr. Luka.
[41:11.73]And maybe it's dumb, but I don't dare go in it anymore.
[41:15.69]Oh?
[41:16.91]Why's that, Ozana?
[41:20.56]Well, it's like it was kind of cursed.
[41:23.74]Really?
[41:24.66]That broom is completely messed up.
[41:27.32]I ain't gonna kill it any dirt.
[41:28.88]The more I rub, the less it goes away.
[41:31.47]And then, the crucifix, it falls down on its own.
[41:35.87]Calm, calm.
[41:37.15]What can I do to reassure you?
[41:39.81]Please, put the cross back in place.
[41:43.18]I don't dare touch it.
[41:44.58]And bless the room.
[41:46.40]That way, I'll be able to go in it to do the housework.
[41:50.49]Dude, that sounds like kind of, I don't know.
[41:52.39]That sounds like scary work.
[41:54.48]The room to the right of mine.
[41:55.58]Oh, get out of the way.
[42:01.12]You want me to do it right now?
[42:09.01]Okay.
[42:11.22]I have to do this right now.
[42:18.27]Bro.
[42:20.78]Arrange them in your storage zone.
[42:48.20]oh this is what I have right now okay so I now put it back automatic storage wait one to keep your work shop you're holding the bible yeah I know I got the bible in my hand
[43:16.62]Oh, there we go.
[43:17.14]Okay.
[43:17.68]How do I put it up?
[43:25.22]Uh... Something's not right here.
[43:30.53]Do I have two crucifixes?
[43:46.36]Uh, uh-oh.
[43:55.46]You're duping items.
[44:02.79]Oh!
[44:04.21]Okay.
[44:18.16]Oops.
[44:20.11]Is that bad?
[44:24.11]The Tower of Babel.
[44:26.58]Make them all speak different languages.
[44:28.86]Spread them out.
[44:29.64]Make it so they can never build a city to heaven.
[44:32.89]How dare they?
[44:35.79]What a nimrod.
[44:38.67]I know the Bible and I know the stories.
[44:40.58]Okay.
[44:44.06]I think I did it right.
[44:52.86]This bolt was forced a long time ago.
[44:59.93]Alright, I did what you wanted me to do.
[45:01.46]Hosanna, I put the crucifix back in place and said a prayer.
[45:05.86]Are you reassured?
[45:07.17]Thank you, Father.
[45:08.19]Thanks a lot.
[45:09.17]I'll be able to fix up the room.
[45:10.97]I hope she's not dead in there in ten minutes.
[45:22.15]We're going to hear a scream.
[45:29.46]That was mean.
[45:33.68]Alright, we need to go to... Oh, there's a journalist in the parlor.
[45:41.23]Forgot about that.
[45:47.18]Huh?
[45:47.38]I thought I had a gun.
[45:53.85]Delighted to meet you, Father.
[45:55.63]Concerning Martha, I mean, Dr. Calugaro, it's very important that you know, she was murdered.
[46:01.87]What are you saying?
[46:03.23]Yes, oh, um, I didn't introduce myself.
[46:07.08]Stefan Luca, um, journalist.
[46:10.04]It's a good thing that you're here.
[46:11.66]Since the departure of Father Gregorio, this village really needed a priest.
[46:16.38]Yet I didn't come to replace him.
[46:18.85]Of course, I know why the Vatican has sent you, for Martha's canonization.
[46:22.95]But...
[46:23.58]I want to talk with you about something else.
[46:25.96]There's something much more serious.
[46:28.47]Martha, well, she was killed for defying evil.
[46:33.45]Oh, my God.
[46:34.19]I should have helped her more.
[46:36.94]I wrote an article, but he prevented me from publishing it.
[46:41.45]He's very powerful, you know.
[46:43.23]Who is it?
[46:44.05]Martha was not his first victim.
[46:46.73]I'm afraid I don't follow.
[46:48.81]Right, okay, but who stopped you from doing this?
[46:59.62]Was it Dracula?
[47:00.59]Do you know Dracula?
[47:01.83]Why does Dracula know you?
[47:03.95]And why are you holding the note that you just gave me?
[47:07.48]Alright, let's read this.
[47:09.75]Sir, I read your last letter with a certain irritation.
[47:13.62]I must admit, let's see.
[47:15.29]The people I am telling you about are afraid to fall asleep.
[47:18.42]Hear voices walk in their sleep and present strange stigmata.
[47:22.47]Finally, and most importantly, they die of a devastating and inexplicable anemia.
[47:28.42]And you believe that it is simply a matter of a nervous affliction?
[47:32.04]Even Professor Von Kruger, the most wonderful man that I know, so conventional in his approach and his wisdom, admitted that it was something else than a nervous disorder.
[47:42.29]I will send you the medical files.
[47:43.80]Please examine them and you will change your opinion.
[47:45.56]Please believe me.
[47:46.88]A strong force is at work and I will be in great need of allies to be able to counter it.
[47:51.14]Sir, please accept my sincerest greetings.
[47:54.99]Put that up here.
[47:55.65]Here are the notes Martha kept.
[48:02.34]Once you've read the file on each victim, you'll be convinced.
[48:05.90]He has a headset dent.
[48:10.63]I don't think that's a headset dent.
[48:17.22]Fuck, okay.
[48:20.66]He's in like a League of Legends game.
[48:23.18]Alright.
[48:25.66]Road Mender.
[48:28.23]Has lived alone since the death of his wife.
[48:29.89]Not very sociable, strong, no previous medical history.
[48:33.81]September.
[48:34.79]Found unconscious while working near the Broken Oak Crossroads.
[48:39.14]October.
[48:39.60]Blood analysis.
[48:40.38]Noted anomaly.
[48:41.26]I'll get in touch with Professor Von Kruger.
[48:44.50]And October.
[48:45.06]Repeated transfusions.
[48:45.97]The patient declares himself cured.
[48:48.28]Two days later, it was found dead on his bed, drained of blood.
[48:53.27]I'll start writing an article on the case with Professor Von Krueger.
[48:56.61]We think we have identified a new syndrome, the pee anomaly.
[49:00.58]The professor wishes that I begin systematic tests in the town's population.
[49:05.72]Schoolboy, orphan.
[49:07.29]The child complains of nightmares, sleepwalking, and sedative prescribed.
[49:13.29]In June, anemia symptoms observed.
[49:16.07]Blood test.
[49:16.85]P anomaly present.
[49:18.70]Blood transfusions improvements, then relapse.
[49:22.06]In July, noted hematoma on the neck.
[49:24.42]I'm very worried.
[49:25.86]Child held at the dispensary.
[49:28.01]I seek the help of G. We take all precautions.
[49:31.51]Alas, I fall asleep during my shift.
[49:33.83]The child dies.
[49:35.89]I contact the police reply.
[49:37.21]Due to the threat of war, no one is available.
[49:39.84]No investigation.
[49:42.50]Unknown young woman.
[49:45.83]Amnesic young woman left on the roads by the war.
[49:48.87]God knows how she arrived in our village.
[49:51.30]Met the young woman close to the cemetery, shivering with cold.
[49:55.87]I took her to the dispensary and gave her food.
[49:58.19]Routine test.
[49:59.33]He anomaly found.
[50:01.00]I noticed several blue marks, no clear wounds, but strange hematoma on the neck.
[50:05.89]Police alerted.
[50:06.73]There is no reaction.
[50:09.20]She comes to see me.
[50:09.90]We apply the traditional method, but the young woman leaves as soon as the dispensary surveillance lightens up.
[50:14.30]She roams aimlessly around the village at night.
[50:17.67]The young woman is found dead at the cemetery, near the grave with the wild rose bush drained of all of her blood.
[50:26.44]Police finally come to the scene, but the investigation is botched.
[50:29.87]Inspector Lupar's conclusion...
[50:33.14]The victim died of cold.
[50:35.43]This is shameful.
[50:36.43]I must do something.
[50:39.05]Uh-oh.
[50:45.35]I chose not to fight.
[50:50.18]I send the child to the Seaside far from here.
[50:54.79]You got anything to say about that?
[51:11.50]The documents you showed me are... astonishing.
[51:15.47]However, I'm surprised Dr. Kalyugaro entrusted you with them.
[51:19.55]Doctor-patient confidentiality and all.
[51:22.36]Medical secrecy is a secondary issue when human lives are at stake.
[51:27.03]Think of it.
[51:28.09]The identified victims are just the latest ones.
[51:31.62]Martha was convinced that there were many others over the past years no the past centuries she wanted me to alert public opinion but the editors of my paper were pressured our enemy is very influential we have to do something let's see I agree that these files are very disturbing but we can't take the place of the police Martha contacted them controls the result perhaps they didn't take her seriously we should call back to explain the situation calmly
[52:01.69]The police, once again, didn't do their job.
[52:04.01]Call them, and you'll see.
[52:05.75]That would seem to be the most reasonable course, if you don't have any objection.
[52:10.04]Go right ahead.
[52:10.68]He wants me to call the police for them to go.
[52:12.20]Nah.
[52:12.62]When you realize the ineffectiveness of the police, come back to see me.
[52:16.18]Okay.
[52:24.95]Number, please.
[52:27.99]Uh, that's the police.
[52:30.37]Yes?
[52:30.98]Yes.
[52:31.66]Put me through to the police station in charge of Vlado Vista, please.
[52:35.50]Please hold.
[52:38.21]You're connected.
[52:43.35]Provincial police, what is it?
[52:45.38]This is Father Moriani.
[52:47.36]Well, several people died in Vlado Vista in mysterious circumstances.
[52:52.51]Vlado Vista, you have the wrong department.
[52:55.45]You have to contact the Transylvania Regional Brigade.
[52:58.62]As for Inspector General Broutard at Alba Euler 22.
[53:01.83]Okay.
[53:03.05]Oh, okay.
[53:03.93]That's... I'll call that number now.
[53:11.06]Number, please.
[53:13.89]Just one moment, please.
[53:16.63]You're connected.
[53:17.41]Is this going to be a case where they tell me to call somebody else?
[53:21.84]This is Inspector Broutard.
[53:23.53]Hello, this is Father Arno Moriani.
[53:26.63]I belong to the Sacred Congregation of Rites.
[53:29.58]I've come to Vladiviste to investigate the case of Martha Caligaro in view of her eventual canonization.
[53:36.97]Martha Caligaro?
[53:38.59]I remember her well.
[53:40.21]Always bothering my men with unbelievable stories and groundless complaints.
[53:45.62]She wasn't a bad woman, but she had a screw.
[53:48.17]Sounds like Joel Haver.
[53:49.41]I'll note your opinion.
[53:50.71]Like identical.
[53:51.55]Inspector, I'm calling because my investigation has revealed several suspicious deaths, which all occurred in Vladoviste.
[53:59.77]They could very well be murders.
[54:02.90]Give me the names of the supposed victims.
[54:05.72]Holy shit.
[54:06.44]Is he in this game?
[54:12.87]This is like 30 years ago.
[54:16.86]I see exactly what you're talking about.
[54:21.98]Wasn't it a certain Stefan Luca who transmitted this information to you?
[54:29.01]Well, that is... Of course it's him.
[54:32.60]Don't believe anything he tells you.
[54:34.62]He's just been...
[54:37.11]I didn't mean to do that.
[54:38.13]He's just a troublemaker.
[54:40.67]Father Moriani, I have to warn you.
[54:42.63]Our country is currently in the grip of a certain agitation and the Catholic minority isn't viewed very positively by certain political groups.
[54:53.21]So if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't prolong my visit to Transylvania.
[54:59.01]That's dead on.
[54:59.75]That's crazy.
[55:00.21]Thank you for your advice, but you understand that I can't leave without carrying out my mission.
[55:06.79]Okay.
[55:08.59]Concerning those deaths I spoke to you about, I have to point out several important facts.
[55:13.48]Yeah, go on.
[55:14.64]I'm listening.
[55:16.18]Well, we have three individuals, dead in the same region and in the same manner, drained of their blood.
[55:23.51]That would suggest the work of some perverted criminal, wouldn't it?
[55:27.57]No, believe me.
[55:29.15]It would suggest, rather, that your informant is bored and has a fertile imagination.
[55:36.54]somebody said when does this game take place 1914 I actually don't remember 1920. okay any reason to think that Dr. Martha was murdered did a physician examine her body certainly not why bother her death wasn't at all suspect goodbye inspector
[55:59.93]the police think that Martha was mad her case doesn't look good but it's out of the question for me to close the file without digging deeper let's go back to the journalist to question him okay so what are you gonna say about that
[56:20.65]Good.
[56:21.33]Did you call the police?
[56:22.77]Are you convinced that they won't do a thing?
[56:25.06]Then we can go on to serious matters.
[56:27.64]Read these two letters and tell me what you think of them.
[56:34.98]Can't you just tell me what happened?
[56:36.22]I believe you.
[56:38.04]Just tell me.
[56:38.46]You want me to read the whole letter?
[56:40.75]You can just summarize it for me.
[56:43.11]So your article was rejected.
[56:44.21]Thank you for your courageous attempt.
[56:46.76]You know that we must find a different solution.
[56:48.32]I will speak to you about it in person.
[56:51.10]To answer your question, please know that I was never interested in vampire legends prior to my arrival in Vladivosti.
[56:57.23]When little Keldrick was at his worst, it was our friend G who helped me implement the traditional measures.
[57:03.98]The garlic and the protective circle.
[57:07.39]I noticed an improvement until that fateful night when I found the window open, the crumbs of host dispersed by the wind and the child dead in his bed.
[57:15.99]How could I, after that, harbor the slightest doubt about the enemy we are fighting?
[57:20.23]Best wishes.
[57:22.63]Alright.
[57:23.92]Bracula, garlic, Mr. G, who is like the garlic guy, I guess.
[57:32.47]I thought a lot of after our last conversation when the, is the, where is the beast hiding?
[57:38.87]It has certainly changed its layer since the war.
[57:41.43]Okay.
[57:42.63]There is still the path of the dragon left.
[57:45.03]I'm convinced that it will lead to my goal.
[57:47.18]I know that you and Ji do not approve my intentions, no doubt.
[57:51.70]There is danger, but my life is not so precious as to prevent me from risking it for a good cause.
[57:58.11]I read the ancient texts.
[58:00.09]Few clues lead me to believe that the path begins in Turkey.
[58:05.05]I plan to go there soon to look for the traces of the dragon.
[58:09.63]P.S.
[58:10.59]Upon my return, I will hand to you the file that I have put together on the path of the dragon.
[58:14.82]If something should happen to me, you will find it in my case.
[58:17.92]To find the key, carefully observe the order of the paintings on the wall.
[58:23.55]Martha.
[58:24.71]Vampires?
[58:25.66]Hosts?
[58:26.92]My lord, I must elucidate this sorry affair.
[58:31.25]Okay.
[58:31.37]Let's subject Stefan Luca to some methodical questioning.
[58:34.39]But not before I pee.
[58:36.14]The letters you showed me raise a lot of questions.
[58:39.15]First of all, what exactly does the term vampire signify?
[58:44.69]Vampire, vampire, upir, upir, rucolacus for the Greeks.
[58:50.10]Do these words really evoke nothing for you?
[58:52.55]To tell you the truth, they do.
[58:54.09]I seem to recall reading something about these, um...
[58:58.52]Go call him!
[59:02.10]Alright, I'll be right back.
[59:09.77]I'm gonna go pee.
[59:29.18]See you guys in a few minutes.
[59:31.81]I'm actually very intrigued.
[59:34.45]I'm very curious about the path of the dragon.
[59:38.26]I think this is going to get interesting.
[59:41.51]I'll be back as I'll start playing in about 30 seconds.
[59:44.42]See you guys in a few minutes.
[64:12.73]Sorry, jump scared you.
[64:17.55]Alright, we got a lot of questions for this guy.
[64:25.48]Sorry, I ate some sunflower seeds.
[64:27.20]You're gonna have to bear with me for a sec.
[64:31.73]A vampire?
[64:33.31]Keep thinking of the fucking headset death.
[64:45.50]I'm sure that Martha didn't die a natural death.
[64:49.64]Bro, you're still talking to this dude?
[65:00.08]Yeah, I'm talking to him.
[65:08.34]We gotta figure out more info.
[65:10.88]since the war we've changed our nationality in our official language one thing hasn't varied the ineffectiveness of the police worse I think they've sold out to our enemy I have reason to believe they wanted to intimidate Martha or even worse when I was 13 I used to eat barbecue sunflower seeds until my lips turned white
[65:39.04]You alright?
[65:40.15]That doesn't sound right.
[65:41.71]That doesn't sound right.
[65:45.23]Prune brandy, that sounds kinda good.
[65:57.53]You burnt your lips?
[65:59.97]That's not good.
[66:03.67]Burning your lips with sunflower seeds.
[66:16.15]Okay.
[66:17.09]Okay, it's like the Bible.
[66:34.09]Okay, open the Bible and go to this passage.
[66:38.54]And they rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.
[66:42.23]I know where it is.
[66:45.53]This is a big rock in front of the door.
[66:59.62]Alright, let's give him a phone call.
[67:01.70]I have to question Father Grigoriou about this sinister story of vampires.
[67:13.90]Number please.
[67:15.38]Give me the uh... The answer please.
[67:24.67]Greenleaf Rest Home.
[67:26.05]Good day.
[67:26.71]Could I speak to Father Gregorio Nejescu, please?
[67:29.63]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[67:32.23]One moment, I'll see.
[67:33.25]Yeah, so far this is like phone call the video game.
[67:36.82]Hello, this is Father Arno Moriani.
[67:39.90]Father, I have to discuss a very delicate subject with you.
[67:43.72]Please answer my questions very precisely.
[67:46.26]It's important.
[67:46.85]Do you know Stefan Luca?
[67:49.83]He's a journalist, a friend of Martha's.
[67:53.43]They developed photographs together.
[67:56.81]According to Stefan Luca, Martha Caligaro believed in vampires and engaged in strange rituals.
[68:06.61]It's true.
[68:08.51]And before you ask the question... Love this info earlier, dude.
[68:11.27]Yes, I helped her.
[68:13.55]You do know the position of the church on this subject, don't you?
[68:17.20]I know it.
[68:18.52]Case closed.
[68:19.00]And I don't doubt that it's a very reasonable position when you think about the question...
[68:24.77]seated in an office in Rome.
[68:28.26]But in Vladoviste, the situation is different.
[68:32.58]Do you want me to tell you how things happened?
[68:35.01]I went to the dispensary to give extreme unction to Seldrick, a poor child who's wasting away.
[68:44.88]I uttered a few of the usual prayers, and then I gave Martha the sacred host
[68:52.67]She used the wafers to draw a protective circle around the sick boy.
[68:58.92]Was it sacrilege?
[69:00.96]You're entitled to think so.
[69:03.70]But the child was going to die.
[69:05.59]This music's going kind of crazy.
[69:09.25]We had to try everything to drive away the creature that was feeding on him.
[69:16.96]What would you have done in my place?
[69:20.34]Stop.
[69:21.63]Oh my god, this game is so boring.
[69:26.65]Just give it... Hold on.
[69:27.89]It's a slow burn.
[69:29.51]Yes, we are in Dracula 3.
[69:32.32]Currently, we are just making phone calls for an hour.
[69:35.68]But... Hold on.
[69:38.38]This game is maybe a slow burn.
[69:40.31]I have heard this is the worst of all of them.
[69:42.89]So, take that with a grain of salt.
[69:46.93]We gotta see this through.
[69:49.24]It'll get there.
[69:50.10]Yeah, it'll get there.
[69:53.38]Martha spoke to me of it.
[69:56.27]It's a sword.
[69:56.89]Oh, no, the draft pack is falling asleep All you've done is listen to exposition and read documents Why is that?
[70:16.65]Today
[70:22.26]We've been on the phone for... I feel like I've just been talking to somebody on the phone for an hour.
[70:29.77]It'll pick up.
[70:30.73]Just wait till the first guy dies, okay?
[70:33.60]Everyone, you guys are gonna turn on it.
[70:36.92]We'll give it a little bit more time.
[70:41.97]Unfortunately not.
[70:42.35]Two nights later, the window opened mysteriously.
[70:47.18]You're not going to be able to bully him into dropping the Drac series?
[70:53.11]Nah, that's not possible.
[70:56.09]It's just not going to happen.
[71:01.23]Because we've played the last two.
[71:03.64]I know what's under the hood here.
[71:05.04]I ain't leaving.
[71:09.90]This Dracula has no flow.
[71:14.87]We'll see.
[71:15.37]Hold on.
[71:15.95]Give it some time.
[71:17.61]The war began shortly after the child's death.
[71:21.97]I left the village.
[71:23.56]I hope stream hates this.
[71:25.12]So the smite stream can no longer be the worst one.
[71:27.58]I love smite.
[71:28.84]We tried to save a young amnesia victim.
[71:32.05]Alright.
[71:32.61]The girl seemed possessed.
[71:35.80]She ripped off the garlic necklace.
[71:38.18]It's been like an hour.
[71:39.62]Relax.
[71:40.80]We've got time.
[71:42.15]Every night.
[71:44.11]She didn't survive long.
[71:46.60]young ariel almost died as well but Martha saved him by sending him away from the village it was probably the only thing to do okay seven luca holds that Martha was murdered very likely I knew she was threatened
[72:09.55]At some point, the inn owner is going to be like, you know, I have to pay for all these calls.
[72:14.27]It's 1920.
[72:15.98]You have racked up a $15,000 bill.
[72:19.76]Where are you calling?
[72:23.03]The Vatican?
[72:24.07]That's not even possible in our current fucking time period.
[72:29.30]It's going to cost me everything.
[72:31.32]If you'd lived a few years in Vladivostok.
[72:36.13]wouldn't this thing be able to call somebody like three blocks down the street not necessarily somebody in like Italy Martha will never be canonized yes of course what does it matter if she rests in peace another thing if a direct question is asked I shall be forced to evoke your part in this business
[73:00.51]So be it.
[73:02.60]But you should know that my only regret is not to have helped Martha fall.
[73:09.37]In the end, I slipped away and was cowardly of me.
[73:16.64]the lord is our only judge I have no wish to condemn you goodbye father Gregory I just forgot he was talking until we were talking over here in the chat I was looking over here talking to you guys now it's time and I this guy was still going I forgot he was even going still alright let's go figure it out ah yes do you believe me now father help me resume the time it's not so simple
[73:48.23]I gotta read the Bible again.
[73:55.60]Keep your word.
[73:58.71]Anybody catch what he told me to do?
[74:09.22]I don't think any of you paid attention.
[74:13.34]I need to make another phone call.
[74:27.43]No, you need to leave.
[74:28.16]You need to go outside.
[74:29.06]Okay.
[74:47.81]Okay.
[74:47.93]Apparently this is a display.
[74:49.54]I think I got to go this way.
[74:57.86]Save the game.
[74:58.70]Oh my God, thank you for saying that.
[75:09.47]Alright, so what do we got?
[75:11.36]What was here?
[75:13.06]According to a Janos told me the crossroads of the broken Oak on straight to get up to the castle.
[75:18.95]I have to keep going straight to get up to the castle.
[75:23.51]You need to wait.
[75:24.19]You have to call 65.
[75:25.79]I actually have to call the Vatican.
[75:31.91]Really?
[75:40.33]Yes.
[75:49.68]Number please.
[75:50.99]Okay, Vatican.
[75:52.49]Please hold.
[76:02.10]He ain't even here!
[76:03.13]You guys are full of shit!
[76:04.17]He's not even there!
[76:05.01]I'm getting ghosted by the... Pope.
[76:11.40]Or whoever that guy was.
[76:12.32]The Cardinal.
[76:18.73]Should I just wait till he picks up?
[76:26.35]Okay, so now I have the actual objective.
[76:39.99]Somebody said there's a stone next to the phone.
[76:44.13]Who owns this?
[76:46.05]Do I have to get permission from this lady?
[76:51.10]Don't I have that thing on the wall?
[76:55.55]May I borrow the dragon you've hung on the telephone?
[76:57.97]Sure you can.
[76:59.27]I don't know where it comes from.
[77:01.27]Some vagabond brought it to me.
[77:03.45]I gave him a meal in exchange for it.
[77:05.90]My way of being charitable, I guess.
[77:08.02]Can I borrow that?
[77:09.36]Okay.
[77:12.46]Thank you.
[77:13.95]Let's get it.
[77:15.77]Alright, I took the dragon symbol.
[77:17.55]I'm ready to go.
[77:20.37]Is that Mrs. Claus?
[77:27.76]Alright, let's go.
[77:31.25]Here we go.
[77:32.51]Progress, finally.
[77:34.75]Up to the castle of Dracula.
[77:50.15]Okay, pretty cool looking.
[77:55.64]Oh, here he is.
[78:00.36]Hello, Janus.
[78:01.66]Welcome to the Castle of Twilight.
[78:04.35]These ruins are impressive, aren't they?
[78:07.23]Imagine this edifice before the war, when the erect ramparts had been standing for centuries.
[78:13.84]The Dragoman family, which reigned over Transylvania in the Heroic Age, lived here.
[78:19.70]Its most famous member was Vlad Tepes, hero of the war against the Turks.
[78:32.97]No, the building is much older, but Vlad Depeche enlarged it by adding the outer walls.
[78:39.83]Okay.
[78:40.70]Was the castle inhabited before its destruction?
[78:42.88]It was lived in until 1900, when the last owner died without any heirs.
[78:49.43]Okay, who is Vlad?
[78:50.35]A magnificent sovereign and a passionate subject to study.
[78:55.88]I think he's the greatest prince Transylvania ever had.
[78:58.66]Okay.
[79:00.59]Thanks for all the info.
[79:01.41]Appreciate it.
[79:02.23]Now it's time for me to go blow away some demons with a shotgun.
[79:08.20]And excuse me.
[79:10.58]Uh, dude.
[79:12.93]I kind of own it.
[79:26.58]Gold with a sable wolf.
[79:28.78]The personal coat of arms of Vlad Tepes.
[79:37.57]Dragon.
[79:38.53]Bingo.
[79:38.83]It's the dynastic emblem of Vlad's family.
[79:41.79]Where did you find it?
[79:43.17]A vagabond gave it to Mozana.
[79:45.80]Perhaps I should return it to her.
[79:48.40]Oh, but its place is here.
[79:50.80]The person who took it had no right to pillage these ruins.
[79:54.28]Did that open a door?
[79:55.14]You're right.
[79:59.10]I just do that for fun.
[80:00.74]Does that not do anything?
[80:02.00]No door opens, no secret crypt?
[80:07.61]Is this guy going to eat my wolves?
[80:11.75]That'd be crazy.
[80:15.26]Hold on.
[80:15.94]Hold on, I promise.
[80:25.61]I'm trying to make something happen here.
[80:29.89]I can't.
[80:30.73]I can't do it.
[80:32.70]I can't do it.
[80:34.22]I was trying to lower the volume by like 10%.
[80:35.96]Okay.
[80:38.96]These ruins are impressive, aren't they?
[80:42.50]Let's explore them.
[80:44.91]The drawbridge is destroyed.
[80:46.79]Right.
[80:47.89]Frustrating, isn't it?
[80:50.01]If only I had the means to restore it.
[80:51.97]We gotta get somebody to build the bridge.
[80:52.90]The castle must have suffered terrible bombing.
[80:55.83]Yes, in addition, the Romanian mountain troops had the dubious idea of storing ammunition here.
[81:02.58]Obviously the whole thing blew up.
[81:06.52]Alright, so we gotta build a bridge.
[81:10.95]Skeletons exposed during the destruction of the ramparts.
[81:15.58]They were convicts who died of exhaustion while digging the foundation of the castle.
[81:20.14]They were buried where they fell, probably so their ghost would guard the place.
[81:25.50]So I can't wait.
[81:32.26]Take the rowan berries.
[81:33.79]This tree is a sorbus.
[81:37.71]Commonly known as the mountain ash or the rowan tree.
[81:40.89]What can I do with these?
[81:41.59]Can I make a bridge with these?
[81:43.00]I already have some.
[81:45.82]Here eat these and see if they're poisonous.
[81:47.26]OK.
[81:53.45]Let's check the Bible.
[82:00.21]I told your disciples to cast this demon out and they could not do it.
[82:10.18]Okay.
[82:13.25]Is there anyone else I can... Maybe I can go somewhere else around or no?
[82:26.93]Okay.
[82:29.87]Guess I have to leave.
[82:30.53]Oh.
[82:38.00]Yeah, the game has the entire Bible.
[82:48.97]What is it going on here?
[82:50.99]Bullet holes, bullet holes on a battlefield.
[82:53.63]It's typical that the trees be riddled with shot.
[82:55.82]However, this oak has traces that seem very recent.
[83:01.50]Okay.
[83:03.88]There's bullet holes.
[83:10.29]Did something just happen?
[83:12.48]I'm telling you, I think the inn lady's dead.
[83:15.78]I think she's dead.
[83:26.02]Yep.
[83:28.33]Hello, I'm Father Arno Moriani.
[83:31.05]Hi, I am Luana the gypsy.
[83:34.44]Tell me priest.
[83:35.86]Do you want to know the future?
[83:37.77]I'd prefer to ask you about the past and the present.
[83:44.82]Do you know Martha?
[83:45.64]Yes.
[83:49.75]She did not choose an easy path.
[83:51.93]She just read something.
[83:54.62]Okay, there are many deaths in this village.
[83:57.12]What is going on down here?
[84:07.88]I see, I see cups, I see dice, I see, what is this?
[84:16.14]Hey priest, do you want to play whatever it is?
[84:19.56]I'm in condition that we don't wager money.
[84:22.27]You want to play for nothing?
[84:24.97]That's not my custom, but I am curious to see how you manage, OK?
[84:30.88]Yeah, let's go examine the dice carefully before you play.
[84:35.79]I got a 7, a 3, a 5.
[84:42.11]four sevens and two ones, 12s, threes, and then all fives.
[84:47.09]Alright, so do I decide on which one I want to take?
[84:50.16]I'm going with the all fives, perfectly balanced.
[85:02.95]Alright, we'll throw it.
[85:12.67]You win.
[85:15.57]Yeah.
[85:15.69]I sure did.
[85:19.88]And what is this for?
[85:25.22]You win.
[85:26.67]Congratulations.
[85:27.51]Alright.
[85:35.80]You win.
[85:36.82]Thank you.
[85:38.02]Great.
[85:42.64]Any info about the town or people in the town?
[85:45.92]Thank you.
[85:48.36]This has been really fun.
[85:49.52]I wish we were playing for money.
[85:55.27]You lose.
[85:57.01]I've played enough.
[85:58.45]I have to concentrate on my mission now.
[86:02.70]You can't go out like that.
[86:08.12]Yeah, lose once and quit?
[86:10.12]You win.
[86:11.49]I guess maybe I could do one more.
[86:14.76]I mean, I did just win five times in a row.
[86:17.34]My mission... Maybe at sunrise tomorrow.
[86:24.85]You win.
[86:29.89]Look carefully at your cards before you play.
[86:33.58]Okay, we got this one, this one, and then this one.
[86:37.22]I'm going to do this one.
[86:41.83]What is the color of the hidden side?
[86:44.84]Wait, what?
[86:47.70]I can see under her hands.
[86:49.81]It's black.
[86:50.31]Pick up the card.
[86:52.21]You lose.
[86:56.19]You can't even tell me the rules.
[87:00.20]Pick up a card.
[87:01.74]Oh, pick up one of these cards?
[87:03.02]Yes.
[87:04.52]What color is it?
[87:05.71]I don't know.
[87:06.49]You lose.
[87:07.95]Alright, bye.
[87:09.65]That game sucks.
[87:18.42]Oh.
[87:20.04]You are an outsider like me.
[87:22.75]Beware of the people of this village.
[87:27.63]Good, nice to meet you.
[87:28.67]OK, goodbye.
[87:33.68]Where's the inn?
[87:39.51]Isn't that the big red building?
[87:41.57]I'm already lost.
[87:49.15]Somebody said you have to go back to the phone and then they put it in parentheses?
[87:52.17]I know.
[88:03.79]Who am I calling?
[88:04.31]Am I calling the Vatican?
[88:05.15]Is he back from his vacation, wherever he was?
[88:09.32]Oh!
[88:09.56]We got him!
[88:10.48]This is Cardinal Felicio Briganti.
[88:13.54]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[88:15.81]How is your investigation going?
[88:17.97]A journalist friend of Martha Kellegarl has a strange story to tell.
[88:23.53]He maintains she was assassinated by a dark power.
[88:28.68]What?
[88:29.64]And what do the police think?
[88:31.89]More phone calls.
[88:35.08]So we don't believe it.
[88:43.65]We're gonna get attacked by a vampire in about five minutes when we hang this phone up.
[88:56.50]Um... yes.
[89:01.56]and he did nothing said nothing well that is don't tell me he took part in these magical rights in fact yes he's gonna strip him of his priest license and was he paid for that I have no reason to think so he seemed entirely disinterested and sincere to me
[89:21.40]Alright, I think we're done.
[89:42.12]I think we're done with the first...
[89:46.92]Do I answer this?
[89:47.78]What's the protocol here?
[89:49.58]Who's calling the- who's calling me?
[89:52.31]We were just talking!
[89:55.79]Sorry, we got disconnected.
[89:59.14]The cell phone signal is dog shit in the Vatican here.
[90:03.26]Did you- did I drop or did you?
[90:08.13]How could a priest encourage practices of the sort?
[90:10.95]That's the crux of the matter.
[90:12.82]You're not paying?
[90:18.01]He said he was gonna call you back?
[90:20.59]Yeah, dude, he didn't do anything.
[90:22.31]He hung the phone up and redialed me.
[90:24.53]He didn't call anybody else.
[90:27.14]Here we go.
[90:33.50]Instructions.
[90:40.63]Certainly.
[90:41.77]And you open another one on vampires.
[90:44.52]Excuse me?
[90:47.12]You heard me right.
[90:48.52]Study the legend.
[90:50.22]Demolish it.
[90:51.48]Prove that it is not based on reality.
[90:54.89]We'll give your report widespread distribution.
[90:58.19]Yes, but hasn't the church already taken a position on the question?
[91:02.03]To be sure.
[91:03.37]Benedict XIV formally condemned belief in vampires, but that was two centuries ago.
[91:09.20]It's time to
[91:10.99]What happened to that Freddy Krueger guy?
[91:12.23]What exactly am I to do?
[91:14.01]Seek the origins of the myth, but also pay attention to its literary aspects, its recent manifestations.
[91:21.70]Show that those phenomena that terrorize the naive... So we are tasked with proving that Dracula does not exist.
[91:27.53]...or have explanations that aren't supernatural.
[91:31.35]Let me insist on one point, Arno.
[91:34.05]For your research, it's important that you consult the best scientific experts.
[91:39.04]We need the authority of a doctor and a historian to support your conclusions.
[91:44.98]I know, Doctor.
[91:45.39]Do you think that a rational discourse can vanquish superstition?
[91:49.45]I know the battle is never definitively won, but it must be fought.
[91:54.68]I hope the task doesn't seem too daunting for you?
[91:58.22]Not at all.
[91:59.38]You're entrusting me with an unexpected job, but a very interesting one.
[92:03.85]I'll get at it without delay.
[92:06.05]How do you like this one?
[92:08.18]Yeah, I'm stealing some chat.
[92:09.46]I'm going to add to it, though.
[92:12.57]They said, a priest, a doctor, and historian walk into a bar.
[92:19.06]Have you heard this one?
[92:19.88]A priest, a doctor, and a historian walk into a bar.
[92:25.31]the doctor... Stux.
[92:29.59]Oh, I think I told it wrong.
[92:31.58]Anyways, um... That was the gist of it.
[92:34.24]I can't tell it that well.
[92:35.76]The village... Just go find Dracula and prove he doesn't exist.
[92:41.91]It would seem self-evident, but the diocese might object.
[92:45.64]D-U-C-K-S.
[92:48.50]Dux.
[92:49.42]If you had to celebrate a funeral mass, for example...
[92:53.98]If that phone rings again, I'm gonna fucking be very upset.
[93:04.03]Okay.
[93:05.52]Our objective.
[93:07.00]Consult a historian who is an expert on the myth of vampires.
[93:10.74]Request the opinion of a doctor.
[93:19.68]Hey, dickhead.
[93:21.14]What do you know about vampires?
[93:22.30]You're a historian.
[93:23.70]Oh, he's a journalist.
[93:26.22]I don't need you.
[93:39.31]I need a doctor, a historian, and a scientist.
[93:41.61]I don't need you.
[93:46.46]I'm out.
[93:47.63]Get out of here.
[93:51.92]Okay.
[93:54.86]all these names designate our adversary the path of the dragon leads to his lair look at this file that Martha entrusted me with on her return from turkey she had established that the path comprised seven trials the related documents are sorted in seven folders I know that work it's raphael's crucifixion
[94:17.92]yes photographed by Martha according to her this first stage of the path of the dragon stage on the path of the dragon really the painting has a hidden meaning Martha thought so she spoke to me of other versions of the same work of art slightly modified reproductions she examined in private collections
[94:38.96]According to her, to understand the hidden message, the original's not enough.
[94:45.13]It has to be compared to the copies and the variations noted.
[94:49.09]Do you have other versions of the painting?
[94:51.36]Unfortunately not.
[94:53.06]Martha gave me this file at the beginning of her research, for she feared her papers would be stolen.
[94:58.93]Afterwards, we had a falling out, and she didn't transmit anything else to me.
[95:03.82]I'm certainly lacking some essential pieces she took a photo yeah style you could say what's going on with this other document is a sketch Martha Martha sketched this ah relief the inscription is hard to make out it vaguely resembles enochian but the drawing is clear the figure is slashing his veins I see the sketch is classified in the first folder with the crucifixion
[95:30.29]Is there a connection then between these two documents and the first stage of the path?
[95:35.64]For Martha, there was no doubt about it.
[95:37.94]Okay.
[95:38.32]Here's a sketch of another bas-relief from the same place as the previous one.
[95:42.71]Martha associated it with the second trial.
[95:45.27]Are we going to hear about all seven of these?
[95:48.06]Nothing for the five last tests?
[95:50.66]They're all I have, but I'm sure that Martha found many others if I'd only been more conciliatory.
[95:58.87]Okay.
[95:59.29]So can I have this?
[96:03.60]Why can't I?
[96:04.02]I want to see the other tabs.
[96:05.63]Alright, we've got to find that painting.
[96:07.83]We've got to figure out what's going on with some kind of maybe a sacrifice of some kind.
[96:11.43]Okay.
[96:18.82]Got it.
[96:21.08]We need to talk to a doctor or a scientist.
[96:23.50]Is that the painting right there?
[96:25.59]Nope.
[96:28.81]That'd be so funny if it was.
[96:31.47]I know a doctor.
[96:32.13]Let's go talk to the doctor.
[96:34.32]Right.
[96:36.34]Whoa, way too much to talk to you about.
[96:51.18]Do you mean canonized?
[96:55.73]Definitely a vampire.
[96:59.82]Alright, our first kill of the game is coming up.
[97:06.95]How do you think it's going to happen?
[97:08.37]Axe.
[97:08.65]Gun.
[97:09.27]Push out window.
[97:16.60]How's it going to go down?
[97:23.55]Oh.
[97:27.29]Way too friendly.
[97:29.41]David.
[97:43.50]I was gonna call the Vatican.
[97:46.76]Why not?
[97:49.61]She's in the other... Oh!
[97:51.39]Hello!
[97:53.49]How are you?
[97:58.94]Thank you for stopping by.
[98:00.25]I noticed that my blood stocks were really insufficient.
[98:03.69]Would you let me take a sample of yours?
[98:05.19]No one's taken a sample of my blood ever.
[98:06.98]Unless it's like a medical facility.
[98:09.14]I saw many lives saved thanks to transfusions.
[98:11.51]This is a medical facility, but I don't care.
[98:12.83]Oh, so you're a nurse as well.
[98:13.73]Then you'll be able to do it yourself.
[98:16.13]Great.
[98:16.91]I have to rush off to see a patient on the other side of the village.
[98:20.32]Oh.
[98:20.70]Let's take my own blood.
[98:22.58]What exactly do I have to do?
[98:26.42]Draw your blood and place the bottle in the refrigerated chest.
[98:29.78]The combination is easy to remember.
[98:31.41]The date the dispensary was built.
[98:34.67]Wait, what?
[98:39.75]When was this place built?
[98:43.68]What?
[98:44.80]No!
[98:45.64]I ain't picking up any more phone calls.
[98:51.67]No, I don't want a phone call quest either.
[98:53.47]What do I have to do?
[98:54.03]Take my own blood then find out who gave other blood?
[98:56.11]That phone- I'm not answering that fucking phone.
[99:04.12]I have to sterilize this equipment before I use it.
[99:06.48]Alright, medical instruments.
[99:09.91]We're gonna do it in this dirty-ass chamber pot?
[99:11.78]Where am I doing it?
[99:23.62]I have to sterilize this equipment before I use it.
[99:26.37]Do I put it in here?
[99:27.29]I have to sterilize this equipment before I use it.
[99:29.84]Do I just put it in the dishwashing machine?
[99:31.47]Those don't exist, I know.
[99:34.03]Which one of these is alcohol?
[99:35.38]I have to sterilize this equipment before I use it.
[99:50.72]Jesus.
[99:52.91]Okay, it was the date that this thing was built?
[100:02.48]How do you ster- I need to sterilize this.
[100:11.17]This rubs so hard!
[100:15.78]Where's the alcohol?
[100:20.95]I can't pick any of these up.
[100:36.59]Oh, I got water.
[100:37.19]I got water.
[100:37.67]Okay.
[100:43.90]I gotta fill this shit with logs?
[100:45.14]You didn't tell me how to do that.
[100:46.18]What is this?
[100:46.56]Give it to me.
[100:58.83]Are we just gonna drop off?
[101:01.34]This is a bad time.
[101:04.46]This is a really bad time.
[101:05.38]Where?
[101:11.07]Hello?
[101:15.10]You gonna ding-dong call me?
[101:18.54]Ditch me?
[101:20.68]I just did!
[101:27.25]Who the fuck is this?
[101:32.51]Oh, it's Freddy Krueger.
[101:48.35]Okay, good.
[101:52.82]Let me take a message.
[101:55.14]Is pot ready?
[102:00.81]What are you talking about?
[102:04.02]There we go.
[102:25.70]Alright, sterilized.
[102:29.73]True.
[102:31.90]Ooh, detailed cutscene.
[102:44.10]So far.
[102:56.32]I picked that up.
[102:56.96]I gotta wash my hands after that.
[103:09.35]OK, let's put this down.
[103:10.89]And.
[103:16.98]Open this.
[103:17.62]We've got to take some of that cotton out, put it in the alcohol.
[103:25.90]Uh, measuring cap containing site citrate.
[103:39.24]Put the tourniquet on me.
[103:43.88]How do I put this on?
[103:50.65]I'm not trying to put the tourniquet on my penis, okay?
[103:53.27]That's not what you draw blood from.
[103:55.53]It's been a while since I've done this.
[103:58.71]Can I, like, tighten it up a little?
[104:03.52]Oh, do I eat the berries first?
[104:07.75]What the fuck, dude?!
[104:09.13]I- What do you mean, wash my hands?!
[104:15.62]What are you talking- I just did!
[104:25.52]Okay, my hands are clean.
[104:27.38]Alright.
[104:32.16]What?
[104:33.67]What is that?
[104:39.77]I need to put this on my arm.
[104:41.72]Where's my arm?
[104:42.34]Put my arm out, dude!
[104:43.50]Put your arm out!
[104:51.39]Okay, this is alcohol.
[104:54.32]Cotton onto alcohol.
[104:56.68]Rub that all over me.
[104:58.79]Why is my arm not out here?
[105:04.49]Okay, this is soaked with... alcohol.
[105:09.70]Alcohol cotton on... tube.
[105:18.75]Attach the tube to syringe.
[105:22.67]I didn't even know you could pick these up.
[105:25.22]Okay.
[105:26.20]Poob in.
[105:30.54]Alright, we're in.
[105:39.07]Now we do this.
[105:42.64]Where's the needle?
[105:45.24]Needle.
[105:50.11]Needle is in.
[105:52.00]We're good to go.
[105:57.04]It works.
[106:00.25]Cotton on your arm.
[106:31.00]Alright, that's good.
[106:34.20]Now we stick this in.
[106:36.03]Alright, let's go.
[106:40.07]What?
[106:55.43]Oh, I suck at this.
[106:57.90]I have to make my veins appear to know where to prick.
[107:01.04]I'll have to place a tourniquet.
[107:11.50]I'm fucking this guy up.
[107:16.67]Okay, wait, what do I... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:23.97]Put some of this on!
[107:28.65]Oh, fuck!
[107:32.78]Okay, it's in, it's in, it's in, it's in.
[107:38.36]It's in.
[107:39.77]Ah!
[107:46.21]I gotta wash my hands.
[107:50.90]I gotta wash my hands.
[108:01.15]It was very dirty.
[108:01.93]I had to wash my hands.
[108:08.67]Oh, fuck.
[108:12.80]Okay.
[108:13.88]Alright, let's go.
[108:15.90]Connect this to this.
[108:18.08]Connect this to this.
[108:19.26]Put the needle on.
[108:20.60]Done.
[108:21.87]Stick that dish over here.
[108:23.45]Stick that in there.
[108:25.87]Baws it up.
[108:27.11]Baws it up.
[108:28.85]Needle.
[108:30.56]First fuckin' try.
[108:33.20]Oops.
[108:38.81]Boom.
[108:41.02]In.
[108:44.81]Drain.
[108:47.09]That didn't do anything.
[108:50.44]Why is this not doing anything?
[109:04.85]I'm pumping air into my veins.
[109:09.90]It's like a fucking bicycle pump.
[109:14.95]The tourniquet's not on.
[109:16.13]Yes, it is.
[109:20.51]Oh, shit.
[109:20.94]I did it.
[109:21.26]Okay, now...
[109:28.69]What do you mean the blood coagulated, dude?
[109:38.77]Why am I crying?
[109:39.67]This is so stupid.
[109:48.88]What the hell?
[109:49.68]Oh, I gotta put this green shit in here.
[109:57.70]Oh my god Okay, I'm ready Needles on and my hands clean Oh fuck, I didn't disinfect
[110:29.80]Alright, let's go.
[110:37.23]I have to... Alright, we're done.
[110:44.27]The ampoule is full.
[110:48.46]Perfect.
[110:50.14]Alright, I got my blood.
[110:51.84]Now I have to store the bottle of blood in the refrigerated cabinet.
[110:57.19]Good.
[110:58.47]Excellent.
[111:00.09]Okay.
[111:02.27]Now that cabinet was... where is it?
[111:06.86]I need to know when was this place built?
[111:15.33]Am I... I think I'm lightheaded.
[111:16.47]Statistical demonstration on the utility of a sepsis in the operating room.
[111:23.44]I think that 30 years ago, surgeons operated without even washing their hands.
[111:28.49]Okay.
[111:30.11]So, that doesn't really help me.
[111:35.67]First, I have to wash my hands.
[111:46.67]Okay.
[111:49.09]Put drops of liquid on these pipe bits.
[111:50.93]Okay, but I need to open this.
[111:57.01]Was it 1905?
[111:58.27]It was 1905, right?
[112:11.69]Open this shit.
[112:17.37]The door of the refrigerated cabinet mustn't stay open too long.
[112:22.74]OK, so let's just leave the bottles in the cabinet.
[112:26.27]We need a test tube.
[112:27.97]Alright.
[112:28.19]Well, I got a test tube right here.
[112:29.29]First, I have to wash my hands with soap.
[112:30.98]Fucking shove it up your ass, dude.
[112:38.61]The door of the refrigerated cabinet.
[112:40.25]Oh, fuck.
[112:41.29]Close it.
[112:41.65]Close it.
[112:41.93]Close it.
[112:50.18]Okay.
[112:50.30]Okay.
[112:51.97]Alright, now I need a test tube.
[112:55.05]And I have to put the test tube in here.
[113:01.64]What do I have?
[113:02.02]What does the game want me to do?
[113:03.04]I gotta save it.
[113:13.20]We need a test tube.
[113:14.66]Okay, test tube.
[113:18.87]What the fuck is this for?
[113:25.63]I just dumped it down the drain.
[113:32.69]And, okay, close it, close that.
[113:37.17]This is a regent, and this is a regent.
[113:47.31]How does this process work?
[114:00.52]Put it in the refrigerated cabinet.
[114:03.04]Oh, okay.
[114:07.63]I don't even remember which one is mine.
[114:10.49]Okay.
[114:11.29]The last three?
[114:12.21]So we need 813?
[114:16.32]Oh my god.
[114:20.18]So this is- that's- that's 813, 812, and 811.
[114:26.75]Close this.
[114:38.64]Alright, now I have to figure out whose blood is whose.
[114:43.55]So this is... 8-11.
[114:49.24]What am I supposed to do with this?
[114:53.49]And your own.
[114:54.53]Oh, shit.
[115:04.76]okay now what do I do with it I can't like put it in here wait I need a funnel why would I need a funnel I don't what is any other equipment I need just sniff it oh okay
[115:33.36]I need 813.
[115:39.11]Ratio of simple and polynuclear granulocytes.
[115:44.68]Analysis.
[115:48.24]This doesn't help me at all.
[115:49.80]Oh, wait, hold on.
[115:53.19]809 is an A-type blood.
[116:00.63]First, I have to wash my hands with soap.
[116:02.93]Fuck off!
[116:10.75]Okay.
[116:18.26]That book is dirty?
[116:20.76]Let me read that.
[116:21.16]I'm gonna consult the Bible.
[116:24.45]Remember now, whoever perished being innocent... Oh, where... Where were the upright destroyed?
[116:32.54]I'm just gonna get it out of the way.
[116:37.59]Okay, I have to combine these so I know one person's blood type.
[116:42.95]809 is... A. So if I mix this... Then I can't put any of these in the dish.
[117:09.65]Oh, what the fuck?
[117:10.61]I can click on that!
[117:12.93]Okay, so there's one in there.
[117:15.88]Alright, so this is my blo- no.
[117:18.62]We're gonna do 809.
[117:21.86]Okay, 809's blood turned orange.
[117:27.83]And then we're gonna put some blue in it.
[117:34.94]It turned- it went polka dot.
[117:39.42]What am I doing?
[117:58.70]Alright.
[118:00.94]So polka dot is... What does mine do?
[118:09.34]Where the hell is mine?
[118:12.40]Alright, I want to see what mine does.
[118:18.11]Mine does polka dot on right, purple on left with blue.
[118:25.98]So that does not match this guy.
[118:28.44]I am not blood type A.
[118:39.32]Okay.
[118:45.34]So, let's try this then.
[118:48.20]I need to know, anybody who has B?
[118:50.91]Alright, this person has O.
[118:51.61]808 has O type.
[118:57.76]Whose is this?
[119:04.87]That person has grimace blood?
[119:07.09]Alright, well, fuck, you just screwed me up so bad.
[119:09.10]What is it?
[119:09.40]808 is O-type.
[119:13.72]Let's see what that looks like.
[119:22.41]Where's 808?
[119:24.51]Up there.
[119:30.44]Hey, uh... Anybody seen Dracula, by the way?
[119:38.03]Uh, can one of the mods snooze that ad?
[119:40.44]I cannot.
[119:41.96]I'm locked in the window.
[119:45.33]Thank you.
[119:49.77]Alright, that one turned orange.
[119:52.36]And that, wait, that's purple.
[119:54.54]Mine was purple.
[119:55.67]On the blue one.
[119:57.15]Right?
[119:57.81]Right?
[120:11.26]Yep.
[120:11.68]Okay.
[120:11.84]That's a match on the blue, but not a match on that one.
[120:15.93]So it's purple.
[120:16.69]I think I'm B. But what's the other one for?
[120:29.47]So B type blood.
[120:39.69]Okay, so I gotta write this shit down, dude.
[120:42.48]I think I'm gonna remember this.
[120:45.90]What about this guy?
[120:59.27]Grab a notepad.
[121:00.55]Okay, this one was matched to...
[121:06.04]This is the exact kind of gameplay I was hoping to see.
[121:07.80]What about 812?
[121:11.76]I might just take pictures with my iPhone.
[121:16.29]Alright, who is 812?
[121:16.95]812, are you listed here?
[121:23.86]Anybody AB?
[121:30.51]Oh, hey, I can just give you the answers if you don't want to do all this trial and error.
[121:33.21]I think this is one of the puzzles people complained about.
[121:37.83]Oh, um... I'm definitely B. Where do I put that down?
[121:52.73]Where's my blood?
[121:59.68]What are the last three donors?
[122:02.83]Uh, where do I even go to put that in?
[122:08.56]This one's mine, right?
[122:14.99]Right there?
[122:17.83]Where do I determine this?
[122:24.22]I almost just dumped it down the sink.
[122:26.06]I would have had to take more blood.
[122:27.73]I would have had to just... I don't know what to do with it.
[122:50.34]You checkmark in the notebook.
[122:52.46]Oh, okay.
[123:02.97]People are spamming the answers in the chat.
[123:06.02]I don't give a fuck.
[123:07.10]Who cares?
[123:07.78]Get me out of this.
[123:08.58]I want to see Dracula, not do blood test iPad game.
[123:13.22]Where's the demons and the Draculas and the scary faces?
[123:17.51]I don't want to do test the blood game.
[123:26.71]Alright, where's mine?
[123:31.13]Oops, I did it wrong.
[123:32.29]Okay, 814 is, what is it?
[123:37.48]This is integral to the plot.
[123:38.97]The plot is I washed my hands 15 times.
[123:50.55]Ow, my head.
[124:09.03]I was B, so I had it right.
[124:11.11]Okay.
[124:12.41]So that's done, right?
[124:15.86]You guys got it wrong.
[124:18.52]That's right, you guys didn't even do it right.
[124:33.89]You are A-B.
[124:39.59]Perfect.
[124:40.35]I'm sure of my results.
[124:42.47]Maria should be happy.
[124:43.54]Okay, I'm going to take a break.
[124:44.56]I'll be back.
[124:47.74]Was she just here the whole time?
[124:51.35]I finished the sample and the tests.
[124:53.47]Have you been back long?
[124:54.39]I should have come help you, shouldn't I?
[124:56.16]Yeah, you should have.
[124:56.68]I was delighted to be of assistance.
[124:59.00]But now I have to think of my own work.
[125:01.06]Of course.
[125:02.21]I hope your investigation is going well.
[125:03.99]It has changed character.
[125:05.95]Oh, no.
[125:08.01]Vampires.
[125:08.79]Like Dracula.
[125:09.83]No, don't.
[125:11.45]I gotta take a break.
[125:19.52]I'll be back.
[125:21.06]We'll catch up on this lady later.
[125:22.70]Oh, Bram Stoker!
[125:24.44]Dracula!
[125:25.04]I can't even all tap.
[125:28.53]Alright, we're good.
[125:32.17]I'll be back.
[125:37.49]I'll just stare at this book for a little while.
[126:29.98]Oh.
[127:06.97]Come on.
[127:37.23].
[128:03.36].
[128:03.40].
[128:17.43]What?
[128:44.48]What?
[129:22.68]What are you guys even listening to over here?
[129:36.09]I would love to... I want to turn the volume down a little.
[129:39.57]I don't think I can, though.
[129:40.87]If I alt-tab, it kind of goes nuts.
[129:44.74]Is the volume fine?
[129:45.94]You guys can control it, right?
[129:54.39]It's good?
[129:59.40]Okay.
[129:59.52]Alright, so we just did that.
[130:01.26]Now she gave us the Dracula book.
[130:04.15]Dracula.
[130:05.83]Oh my god.
[130:09.96]Bro had to scan every page.
[130:15.19]This game came out in like 2003.
[130:27.89]got the whole they got the bible in here they got Dracula in here how was it that all the people at bistros and on the coach had some terrible fear for me what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash
[130:48.32]A band of Susgani have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard.
[130:54.63]These are gypsies and there are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania who are almost outside all law.
[131:00.06]They attach themselves as rule to some great noble boy.
[131:03.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:07.85]Young Mrs. Bad.
[131:08.97]Very bad.
[131:09.47]She wants blood.
[131:10.65]Are we speaking as Dracula?
[131:14.21]I never read this book.
[131:21.26]You can read the Bible too?
[131:25.93]Has anyone ever read this whole book?
[131:27.79]Be honest.
[131:30.47]When I was 12?
[131:33.64]I can't believe it's the entire actual book.
[131:52.57]This must have been a feat of gaming here.
[132:01.30]To put all these in one game?
[132:06.30]Not really.
[132:09.52]As he did so, the narrow black velvet band, which she seems always to wear around her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat.
[132:22.55]Okay, well, I have a question.
[132:26.21]Have you underlined all this shit already?
[132:30.78]I feel like this is, you're a teacher.
[132:37.51]There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim.
[132:45.48]And every now and again struck the window with its wings.
[132:48.91]When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.
[132:55.28]I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.
[132:59.94]There are always mysteries in life.
[133:07.32]I read it.
[133:07.94]Dude, they put 500 JPEGs in a folder.
[133:22.18]This is incredible.
[133:31.91]Hey, speaking of Dracula, Professor Kruger called while you were out.
[133:34.79]I can guess what comes next.
[133:36.30]He wants me to call back as soon as possible.
[133:38.94]You don't really want to, if I'm not mistaken.
[133:43.59]Professor Kruger is a great scientist.
[133:46.23]He worked with Martha and now insists on me continuing her research.
[133:50.22]But I haven't a research scientist soul.
[133:53.00]Anyway, it's too much work.
[133:55.03]Now isn't that a shame?
[133:58.78]Oh, please, Father, no sermons.
[134:01.34]I promise that I'll take it upon myself to finish the analyses he wants from me.
[134:05.64]Reading Dracula would be more interesting than the game.
[134:13.67]Hey, we're gonna give eye, we're gonna see it.
[134:16.35]I don't care.
[134:18.92]What does Dracula mean?
[134:20.18]The word has two meanings.
[134:21.88]Devil or dragon.
[134:23.78]Hey, that blood stuff was really fun.
[134:26.13]I was happy about how that turned out.
[134:27.85]That was like crazy.
[134:31.62]I know him.
[134:32.76]He came to the dispensary too to give his blood.
[134:36.50]He did?
[134:38.29]I'm afraid not.
[134:39.73]For me, vampires are romantic fictional characters, not subjects to be studied.
[134:47.27]Are you sure that's really Vlad?
[134:49.48]Team Jacob or Team Edward?
[135:09.97]Which one's the vampire?
[135:11.18]Because we're currently playing a vampire game, so that's where my vote is right now.
[135:18.26]It's been translated into every language.
[135:20.61]And I've heard that the director, Murnau, is going to do a film version.
[135:24.32]But I don't know if I will have the opportunity to see the movie.
[135:28.43]You're pretending you don't know.
[135:30.66]I actually don't.
[135:31.14]It's been so long, dude.
[135:32.38]That movie, whatever it was, the fucking fictional franchise came out 10, 15 years ago now.
[135:39.95]I've never even seen it.
[135:41.65]Wait, no, that's not true.
[135:43.07]I have seen on TV one time, flipping through the channels, they were in a big field and there was a big battle going on and it was three people in a field versus three people in a field and one turned into a werewolf and it was... And then I changed the channel.
[136:07.48]That's the ending.
[136:10.42]Was it the baseball game?
[136:11.59]Ah, that makes sense.
[136:22.32]Are you team Jacob or team Edward?
[136:25.24]I just answered that.
[136:26.08]Did you just come into the stream five seconds ago?
[136:28.36]You had to have.
[136:29.36]That person joined the stream and had the same question.
[136:34.97]Alright, well I did this.
[136:35.87]I got my I gotta doctor.
[136:40.16]Gotta go talk to Janos.
[136:48.71]Let's go talk to Janos.
[136:51.49]The treatment room.
[136:55.83]Thanks for all the fun.
[137:05.14]I have to talk with Janos.
[137:07.35]I wonder if he knows that his great hero, Vlad Tepes, served as the model for Dracula.
[137:12.83]Dracula.
[137:15.13]Dracula.
[137:20.32]Is he all the way back up on the mountain?
[137:23.80]I think he is.
[137:39.38]Wait a minute.
[137:40.76]Wait a minute.
[137:48.01]I got obsessed with Blade when I was around that age and had never even seen it.
[137:54.16]There he is.
[137:56.60]What's up, dude?
[137:58.18]I got some bad news.
[137:59.16]Hello, Janos.
[138:01.08]I have a surprise for you.
[138:02.66]I've just been ordered to conduct an investigation into vampires.
[138:07.41]Uh, hey Josh.
[138:12.06]How far are we on the walkthrough?
[138:23.04]What percentage are we through the walkthrough?
[138:31.37]I'm very curious how far we're into the game.
[138:35.37]Hey, did you know that this Vlad is Dracula?
[138:40.22]That's a legend forged by his enemies.
[138:42.84]Stoker was inspired by it to write a very bad novel.
[138:51.23]You're at about 1.15 in a five-hour walkthrough.
[138:53.67]How is it a five?
[138:54.57]I've been playing for two hours.
[138:55.98]How does this count?
[138:56.68]How does this happen to me?
[138:59.66]Did they skip all the dialog?
[139:00.98]I haven't skipped very much dialog.
[139:02.38]I've skipped a ton of dialog.
[139:06.07]the recognized expert on the subject was professor van bergen the great orientalist the man who crisscrossed Asia for the English secret service they didn't wash their hands all those times oh that was like 30 minutes of hand washing at his death his superb collection was bequeathed to his successor professor irina buxer
[139:26.45]Okay.
[139:29.00]Professor?
[139:30.04]I gotta make another phone call.
[139:33.44]Okay.
[139:34.90]Good.
[139:36.48]Good.
[139:37.91]Okay.
[139:40.53]Bye.
[139:41.73]See you later.
[139:50.72]I'm gonna go pick up the phone again.
[140:08.91]Is that Seaman's voice?
[140:10.03]It does kind of sound like Seaman.
[140:13.02]Is there a new character in here?
[140:22.05]You're about a quarter of the way through the game.
[140:30.40]Why am I calling this guy?
[140:39.05]This is Professor Heinrich von Kruger.
[140:42.01]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[140:44.12]Professor, I'm calling back to ask for your help.
[140:47.70]How can I help you?
[140:48.78]Well, it's rather delicate to explain.
[140:50.80]You should know, first of all, that I belong to the Holy Congregation of Rites.
[140:56.23]I came to Vladivostok to investigate the life of Martha Caligaro.
[141:00.61]Would you like me to talk to you about her?
[141:02.63]She was a remarkable woman.
[141:04.78]To tell the truth, my mission has changed.
[141:07.67]You guys love this cool character, Phone Muppet.
[141:17.65]I'm seeing that a lot over here.
[141:22.70]Talk to the headset lump guy in the parlor.
[141:29.03]Oh, okay, thanks.
[141:33.96]It's funny that actually that's how I know him.
[141:36.20]I don't even know his actual name.
[141:39.19]Do you realize this is a very subject of the research I was carrying out with Dr. Calugaro?
[141:44.43]We discovered a disease, the P syndrome, whose symptoms are quite similar to those attributed to the victims of vampires.
[141:51.14]So the legend is based on specific medical facts.
[141:55.40]I feel like this guy's a vampire.
[141:57.32]Tell me, could I ask you a personal question?
[142:00.45]Listening to your voice, I have the feeling that you're a little tense.
[142:04.54]Yes, I'm not sleeping well.
[142:06.92]Nothing else?
[142:08.18]You can confide in me.
[142:09.46]I'm a doctor, you know.
[142:10.87]No, I gotta go.
[142:12.19]Bye.
[142:12.29]Sometimes I get the feeling I'm being spied upon.
[142:16.69]I'm sure it's only an impression, but it's becoming an obsession.
[142:20.78]Father Arno, you are sensitive and susceptible.
[142:24.06]Like our late, lamented Dr. Caligaro.
[142:26.60]It's about these scary horror violins.
[142:28.43]They make you vulnerable.
[142:30.37]Above all, don't let your imagination govern you.
[142:33.99]That's good advice.
[142:35.11]Thank you.
[142:35.49]I'll try to follow it.
[142:36.85]Goodbye, Professor.
[142:38.11]Goodbye, Father.
[142:49.67]Oh, the Chad vampire investigator.
[142:53.29]And the virgin phone operator.
[143:07.38]Father, we have to follow the path of the dragon.
[143:10.57]Let's go to Turkey.
[143:11.75]Since Martha went there, together we'll succeed.
[143:14.84]I was trying to look down for the virgin one and look up.
[143:19.04]You know that fucking meme?
[143:20.67]It just didn't go down all the way.
[143:30.37]Irina Buksov, I tried to contact her, and I was rejected.
[143:34.15]She's incredibly mistrustful.
[143:36.23]It's a shame, because I think she knows a great deal about the path of the dragon.
[143:40.42]Do you have her phone number?
[143:42.14]Who knows?
[143:42.84]Maybe I'll be luckier than you.
[143:47.00]Do you think so?
[143:47.63]Possibly, you're a priest.
[143:49.47]That inspires trust.
[143:51.03]Call 445-827 in Budapest.
[143:54.61]But whatever you do, don't say you know me.
[144:04.37]I've picked up this phone so many damn times.
[144:07.02]I am so done with this phone.
[144:09.52]Number, please.
[144:16.86]This is Arena Box-Off.
[144:18.58]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[144:20.78]Hello, Professor.
[144:22.24]At the request of my hierarchy, I'm investigating the persistence of certain superstitions.
[144:26.33]I'm going to take the phone away and there's going to be like a phone burn mark on my ear.
[144:29.17]I've used it so many times.
[144:31.91]Remember that shit they used to say about cell phones?
[144:34.20]It's like, oh, be careful.
[144:34.96]If you use it too long, you'll burn your ears.
[144:37.70]You'll fuck up your brain.
[144:40.91]But tell me, what exactly is your investigation focused on?
[144:45.12]belief in those imaginary creatures called vampires vampires didn't they used to make little devices you would put a little strip you put on your phone to stop from scrambling your brain waves this is like 15 to 20 years ago I remember this product I am in great demand you know could you be more precise about the framework in which you're conducting your inquiry
[145:09.29]I was entrusted with it by Monsignor Felicio Briganti of the Congregation of Rights.
[145:15.24]If need be, you can contact him by calling Vatican 63.
[145:18.42]Your references are serious.
[145:21.59]I'll accept to help you, Father, but I don't trust the telephone.
[145:27.76]Hey, new location.
[145:29.39]Honestly, guys, I wouldn't be surprised.
[145:33.15]I wouldn't be surprised if in a hundred years they were like, wait a minute.
[145:37.94]They were sending transmissions to each other through the air?
[145:42.34]What the fuck?
[145:42.74]Were they fucking stupid?
[145:44.57]I don't know.
[145:46.27]Like I told you, Barney Rubble was selling people cigarettes 50 years ago.
[145:51.28]I don't know.
[145:53.38]In a hundred years they might be saying, what the hell were we doing?
[145:56.30]Brought out by the Friends of the Vatican Library.
[146:01.33]Published by the Friends of the Vatican Library?
[146:04.23]In that case, it won't be difficult for me to procure a copy.
[146:07.43]Goodbye, Professor.
[146:08.73]Goodbye, Father.
[146:09.95]We already have the signs it's been well-studied.
[146:14.76]And the well-studied cigarette.
[146:16.32]The flavor there, with the filter on the end.
[146:19.82]And that filter filters out all the bad stuff.
[146:22.31]Take it from Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
[146:24.55]Filtered cigarettes.
[146:30.78]Stop spreading conspiracy mis- I'm not spreading a conspiracy, I'm just saying that's- I don't know, who knows what the fuck we're gonna figure out.
[146:38.39]They might find out 500 years from now that apples were poison.
[146:42.91]And screwing up our fucking DNA, I don't know.
[146:45.50]This music is not helping me.
[146:50.66]I have to call Monsignor Briganti to alert him that I'm going to Budapest.
[146:54.45]Oh my god, I have to call another fucking guy!
[146:56.71]Number, please.
[147:04.24]There's so many phone numbers.
[147:07.18]Who does it want me to call?
[147:08.18]This is Cardinal Felicio Briganti.
[147:16.81]This is Father Arno Moriani.
[147:18.92]I intend to go have a discussion with Professor Irina Boxov in Budapest to complete my file on vampires.
[147:24.78]This one is not good.
[147:26.40]I gotta be honest with you, Dracula 3 sucks.
[147:28.57]All we've done is made phone calls for fucking three hours.
[147:31.57]I'll go back to Vladoviste first.
[147:34.31]The switch up?
[147:35.37]He switched up so bad?
[147:39.20]No, I think the game switched up on him.
[148:02.32]Let me insist on one point, Arno.
[148:05.15]For your research, it's important that you consult the best scientific experts.
[148:10.22]We need the authority of a doctor and a historian to support your conclusion.
[148:14.82]Yeah, we have to assemble the Avengers.
[148:17.35]I get it.
[148:17.71]And after you've finished your work, make sure you get some rest.
[148:23.20]Goodbye, Your Eminence.
[148:24.74]Be well, Arno.
[148:26.83]I might just be like an ADHD Andy.
[148:31.01]Right?
[148:32.11]But if you have... Here's my opinion on all this.
[148:34.73]On the whole world.
[148:36.92]On the whole world of video games and everything.
[148:39.58]Stuff like this... Let me shoot a guy in the chest with a crossbow.
[148:43.18]Right?
[148:43.90]And have like a chase scene where I run away.
[148:47.65]Let it open up with a werewolf chasing me and I shoot him in the fucking neck with a crossbow.
[148:53.07]And then have me do like a puzzle.
[148:55.39]And then let me make all the phone calls.
[148:57.57]Do you know what I mean?
[149:00.25]I feel like I'm fine making all the phone calls.
[149:02.98]If I shot a werewolf in the neck with a crossbow three hours ago.
[149:10.09]Should I tell this guy that I'm leaving?
[149:15.83]Where even is the train?
[149:16.65]Ozana, I'm leaving for Budapest for a day or two.
[149:19.86]Would you please keep my room?
[149:21.68]Well, that is...
[149:23.90]naturally I'll pay you for my keep even for the nights that I'm not here in that case of course father I'll keep your room for you slow burn I know I'm I'm gonna reserve all my thoughts I am not giving up on Dracula 3 I'm very intrigued about this path of the dragon I'm very intrigued about the blood stuff
[149:53.26]let's see what happens when we get on this train okay everything that I just said we might get attacked on the train
[150:02.44]Right?
[150:03.10]It's possible that a vampire is sitting there with a newspaper up and he's got a big, you know, 10 gallon hat on or whatever.
[150:10.57]And we walk by and he puts the newspaper down and he has red eyes.
[150:13.75]And then we get attacked on the train and there's a fists up FPS sequence where both your fists are in frame and it's like a punch, punch, punch, dodge, dodge, block, block, block with the two big detailed fists facing you.
[150:27.88]You know what I'm saying?
[150:29.14]That could happen right now.
[150:39.02]No, I fell asleep on the train.
[150:53.64]Alright, I'm happy about that.
[150:54.96]That's fine.
[151:03.99]8 a.m.
[151:04.53]Budapest.
[151:13.52]herman van bergen I won't go in without knocking this is no time to leave come in hey yeah you got a phone father arno I presume you didn't have too much difficulty finding my office no the concierge told me what I needed to know you have a wonderful place
[151:41.82]He's full of shitty stuff the whole time.
[152:05.83]Okay.
[152:08.58]What is the source of the belief in vampires?
[152:20.41]The first trace we have stems from ancient Babylon.
[152:24.68]The creation poem contains sinister allusions to Lilith, the unappeasable, who sucks the blood of newborns.
[152:32.23]Several centuries later, the Odyssey evokes dead people who crowd together to drink at a blood-filled ditch.
[152:39.22]but it's in Europe beginning in the 14th century that veritable epidemics of vampirism are described they would continue until the 18th century a period which left us much written testimony for example the famous visit written in 1732 by a retired austrian military doctor in it we learn in abundant detail how serbian peasants open a vampire's grave and execute him by driving a stake through his heart
[153:08.30]I gotta pay attention I keep looking over and you guys are just saying crazy shit somebody said the Pringles mustache hair I guess it's perfect it does look like the front of a Pringles can
[153:35.86]Give me this book.
[153:43.19]What about this book?
[153:48.91]Can I read your books?
[153:56.70]Let me consult the Bible.
[154:03.73]Okay.
[154:06.22]We have to exhaust dialog here.
[154:07.80]He never told me.
[154:08.58]I've had various hypotheses, of course, but I must confess, the question intrigues me.
[154:14.33]And to think that the answer might lie behind you.
[154:17.69]The personal papers of Herman are in this strongbox.
[154:20.91]He died suddenly and didn't have the time to give me the code for opening it.
[154:25.22]Can I try to open it?
[154:26.74]I'm no expert in the matter, but with a little luck... Gladly.
[154:31.25]I'd be very grateful if you managed to open Herman's strongbox.
[154:36.76]This is a challenge?
[154:37.60]You want me to go open it?
[154:38.52]Okay.
[154:40.62]It's going to be Dracula.
[154:48.86]I was going to say, I can do it.
[155:03.39]I can't get over how clearly I can hear the mechanism.
[155:06.51]Why am I getting superpowers?
[155:17.69]MD... Alright, Doctor... Doctor C-C... Doctor C-C-C...
[155:40.07]Dr. CCCCXX.
[155:45.06]I found the combination.
[155:46.68]MDCCCXX.
[155:49.70]Looks like a number in Roman numerals.
[155:56.89]Thank you for opening the strongbox, father.
[155:59.45]Would you be so kind as to deposit the contents on my desk?
[156:03.08]Sure.
[156:07.98]Somebody's finger in there.
[156:10.42]A wax cylinder and a letter.
[156:12.36]Let's see the letter.
[156:14.74]What's it say?
[156:22.32]Very interesting.
[156:24.16]Are you familiar with the name of Bram Stoker?
[156:27.19]He's the author of Dracula.
[156:28.97]I had the opportunity of perusing his novel.
[156:31.00]Did you know it was Bram Stoker's Dracula?
[156:35.87]You know Bram Stoker is, you know, it's Frankenstein, it's Dr. Frankenstein, it's Frankenstein's monster, and everyone says that?
[156:44.16]Did you know that?
[156:45.75]Did you know that?
[156:54.19]who's got who's igor master I must admit that your last letter caused me some grief I hereby hope to reassure you and above all convince you that I did not misuse the fascinating history that you recounted to an Adam Sandler above all please know that I have never doubted the gravity of this matter
[157:17.58]is precisely for that reason that I found it in good source of inspiration I understand that you do not wish to be troubled since all you did was to perform your duty however during that memorable meeting at the club you most certainly suggested that we employ prudence and discretion but you did not require us to keep an absolute secret why act in such a manner if not because you wished in one way or another to warn humanity against the terrible danger you had faced and is this not the real reason for which you confided in us
[157:46.75]or if it is impossible to reveal the naked truth without bringing you any prejudice.
[157:52.00]What better means of warning our contemporaries against the lords of the night than a novel that reveals their tricks and especially the means to destroy them?
[158:00.01]Thus I had reasoned to... And I reasoned, and that is why I wrote Dracula, this book of which you disapprove today.
[158:11.97]Consider, however, that I have moved the action from Transylvania to England, that I created two distinct characters from your Luciana.
[158:20.26]In other words, that I considerably altered your story, which, must we note, recounts events that are already 24 years old.
[158:28.75]Is this not enough to protect you?
[158:32.20]As to your other criticisms, do not they contradict the first ones.
[158:36.84]Because after having reproached me for having disclosed too much, you accused me of deforming and watering down the facts.
[158:43.01]It is true that I often let my imagination and sensibility guide my quill.
[158:47.52]The greatest liberty that I took was no doubt to give my novel a happy end.
[158:51.45]But the story of a failure could have... Idiot.
[158:55.49]Could have generated such distress when we wished on the contrary to inspire hope and the desire to fight.
[159:02.41]he's having a brave stroke finally you write I would have preferred that you do not quote me to my deepest regret in order to respect your will I've struck out from the drafts your real family name will you at least allow me to designate you by the latin form of your name arminius
[159:26.20]Without that, I would feel guilty of literary ingratitude.
[159:29.68]Please accept my sincere devotion and admiration.
[159:33.39]Ram Stoker.
[159:38.26]So then Stoker was inspired by a story told him by Professor Von Bergen.
[159:43.30]The story of events that had taken place in Transylvania.
[159:46.57]Perhaps in Vladivostok?
[159:49.01]It's probable.
[159:49.92]Did you know that Professor Van Bergen knew Bram Stoker?
[159:53.66]Yes, but I ignored all the details that are recounted in this letter.
[159:57.73]I only knew that Stoker had cited Herman among the sources inspiring him, and Herman was not flattered.
[160:04.31]Had the professor foreseen the novel's success?
[160:07.15]In no way.
[160:08.72]One day he told me... Somebody's got to get eaten by a bat soon or I'm going to lose my mind.
[160:12.09]That irresponsible man didn't understand half of what I told him.
[160:14.39]That glass has to shatter and two bats have to come in, human-sized.
[160:18.18]Fortunately, his book will be quickly forgotten.
[160:26.71]That's true, but it's very hard to find one's way in it.
[160:30.38]Herman had a very particular way of storing his books.
[160:33.00]I'm only basing this on Dracula 1 and Dracula 2.
[160:36.18]This is the third in the trilogy.
[160:38.27]Without this catalog associating each book with its call number, I'd be lost in my own library.
[160:43.69]Okay, do I have... I can open this?
[160:45.18]Every time I take a volume from the shelf, I write its call number on a bookmark I slip between the pages.
[160:50.72]That way I can put it back in place without losing too much time.
[160:54.61]For the same reason, I use ghosts.
[160:58.33]Ghosts?
[160:59.51]Yes.
[161:00.30]There are ghosts in my library.
[161:02.64]That's what we call the pieces of white cardboard that signify the place of a missing work on the shelf.
[161:11.39]It has to.
[161:12.55]Reports describe hundreds of grave openings.
[161:15.48]The vampire's cadaver is identifiable because it's perfectly conserved.
[161:19.86]It often appears swollen by the blood it has absorbed.
[161:23.39]Okay.
[161:25.18]You speak of vampires as if they existed.
[161:27.07]Reassure me you don't really believe in them, do you?
[161:30.06]What do you mean by believe, father?
[161:32.63]I mean, do you think that vampires have a real, objective existence?
[161:38.21]real or objective you must choose father because the only immediate reality is subjective the rest are just hypotheses alright your viewpoint is unassailable so let me reformulate my question has been demonstrated Jean-jacques rousseau said if ever there was in the world a warranted and proven history it is that of vampires nothing is lacking isn't there reports affidavits of well-known people of surgeons of magistrates
[162:06.61]Jacques Rousseau?
[162:11.38]Jacques Cousteau?
[162:13.80]Isn't that one of the famous explorers?
[162:27.04]Okay.
[162:28.26]Let me open it then.
[162:34.57]Here's the catalog of the Lords of Twilight.
[162:37.24]Professor Herman was a Lord of Twilight.
[162:41.60]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[162:42.20]This is just a gift to Professor Herman.
[162:45.03]Hoping that in spite of our differences of opinion, he will appreciate this study, which owes a lot to his immense knowledge.
[162:55.20]Okay.
[162:55.32]Yeah, we got this.
[162:56.22]This monster is vampires.
[162:58.98]The Lords out of the dragon.
[163:02.22]the trials of the path are at crossing points of the real the symbolic and the magical they are tremendously selective and if it happens that exceptional beings overcome one or two of them without realizing fully the journey they are undertaking completing it requires a total commitment okay so it's a path you have to not waver from first link lilith the killer of babies
[163:33.49]I thought Lilith was like the daughter of hatred.
[163:38.23]They took that out of Diablo 4.
[163:39.69]I don't think that would have ran really well at E3.
[163:54.71]I'm seeing mixed results on that one.
[163:57.78]I'm seeing... I just saw an O brother.
[163:59.22]Ha ha ha!
[164:03.57]I won't examine.
[164:05.38]Alright, now what do I want to do?
[164:06.46]The Lords of Twilight is the work of an insane person.
[164:09.36]It's sheer madness.
[164:11.34]Father, the war that has just ended shows that the whole world can go mad.
[164:16.79]In less than 30 years, evil will seize power.
[164:19.69]90% minus twos does not mean mixed.
[164:22.17]No, it does.
[164:23.01]Not so quickly, not so soon.
[164:25.36]After the carnage we went through, the world will take the time to let its wounds heal.
[164:30.30]You'll see.
[164:31.24]The author of the book, the Thule Society... No, we have not seen Dracula.
[164:34.57]Dracula's sleeping on the train on his way to Budapest right now.
[164:37.31]...trampling on corpses to gain power and eternal life.
[164:41.07]The war will come because of them and their like.
[164:49.72]I see it as a way to force destiny to attain, thanks to the Force, spheres forbidden to man.
[164:55.57]You must consult the Bible.
[164:56.35]How could that be possible?
[164:57.84]Father, you are well placed to know that sacraments of good exist.
[165:01.90]You must accept that there are also sacraments of evil, handed down from time immemorial.
[165:07.99]If they do exist, these sacraments can only be dangerous illusions.
[165:14.01]Just get hammered?
[165:14.96]They do exist.
[165:16.10]Seven of them.
[165:17.50]Seven stages of the same route.
[165:19.92]Seven trials to change a man into a bloodthirsty monster who pretends to deal with God as an equal.
[165:26.33]The keys to the path of the dragon are hidden in ancient documents.
[165:30.32]Take this occult work.
[165:32.06]It contains an illustration that I would ask you to examine carefully.
[165:35.85]What do you think about that?
[165:37.81]What's the... What do you guys think?
[165:47.06]I know that painting.
[165:48.34]I saw it very recently.
[165:49.36]It's Raphael's crucifixion scene.
[165:52.10]Although, no.
[165:53.62]Yeah, we could go bush mode on this.
[165:55.61]On Sunday.
[165:56.49]Excellent memory.
[165:57.93]It is indeed a copy.
[165:59.77]We shall point out the differences with the original one by one.
[166:03.49]Add red food coloring to it and drink it out of a goblet.
[166:11.24]That kind of sounds pretty fun, actually.
[166:23.74]It actually is spot the difference, yeah.
[166:29.44]The altered copy of Raphael's Crucifixion illustrates a book on the occult from the Van Bergen Collection.
[166:35.97]Quoting to Professor Bogstow, their interpretation of the differences between the copy and the original is essential.
[166:43.10]Alright, so we have both of these.
[166:45.83]This is not the required action.
[166:49.53]Alright, so why don't I have...
[166:55.70]Excellent memory.
[166:57.26]It is indeed a copy.
[166:59.14]We shall point out the differences with the original one by one.
[167:06.21]This is how I play these games.
[167:10.50]We go like this.
[167:12.42]I just click until I find one.
[167:16.44]It sucks wicked bad when the game knows you're going to do this and every time you click it is an X and you lose a life.
[167:22.21]That's how you stop the player from being a piece of shit.
[167:35.78]I didn't find anything wrong with this.
[167:44.11]What does it actually want me to do?
[167:47.99]I can't really do anything.
[167:49.81]I can't move anything.
[167:50.53]I can't touch anything.
[167:54.80]Where's the actual little picture of it?
[167:56.98]Here we go.
[168:00.01]Alright.
[168:01.45]Uh...
[168:05.71]So this is 9.
[168:06.33]The fake one is colored.
[168:27.35]Yeah, I mean, but she took a picture of it.
[168:38.67]Hey dude, one's in black and white.
[168:41.59]Yeah, this one's col- I know this one's colored in.
[168:54.77]Are there any differences at all?
[168:56.25]Yeah, okay, where's the sh- how do I say there's nothing in your hand?
[169:09.62]I solved it.
[169:10.62]I just found one.
[169:11.68]How come I can't click right here?
[169:17.81]Did you get a switch too?
[169:37.67]Uh, I have not.
[169:40.01]Read the top.
[169:42.95]Oh, my fucking God.
[169:45.08]In the original painting, the angel on the left holds two chalices.
[169:48.94]Why didn't she say this before?
[169:50.36]I was going back and forth between the two of these.
[169:57.69]In your copy, the angel on the left is only holding one chalice.
[170:03.29]Absolutely.
[170:04.50]They're doing it.
[170:05.12]I'm not even playing.
[170:06.00]They're playing.
[170:06.86]There's another one, but you'll need a magnifying glass to see it.
[170:12.21]Focus your magnifying glass on the base of the cross.
[170:15.53]They're actually playing it.
[170:16.56]I'm not.
[170:18.28]I'm not even reading that.
[170:27.70]Okay.
[170:28.22]Great.
[170:44.35]These variations between the two versions of the crucifixion are troubling.
[170:49.21]You say that Professor van Bergen was able to interpret them?
[170:52.39]Herman was convinced that the variations in the documents reveal the secrets of the path.
[170:57.87]Imagine yourself as a copyist, seeking to transmit a message to initiates.
[171:03.50]Two methods are possible.
[171:05.48]Either you add an element to the original, or more subtly, you remove one.
[171:10.28]The chalice?
[171:11.14]Yes, it's absent from the copy, and I think it's a way to draw attention to it.
[171:15.97]The devil leaves his signature in its absence, Herman said.
[171:19.35]Then the chalice is important.
[171:21.82]An object is associated with each stage of the path.
[171:25.50]I'd venture a guess that the chalice is one of them.
[171:28.14]Okay.
[171:28.48]There are six others to discover.
[171:29.53]We need to get the chalice.
[171:30.87]What happens at the end of the route?
[171:34.67]The initiate must accomplish one last rite.
[171:38.14]He won't be able to unless he's understood all he's achieved before.
[171:42.12]I hope we do all this to summon and reincarnate Dracula just to throw acid in his face again and just kill him.
[171:47.51]As well as the objects and symbols related to each of them.
[171:53.51]okay if you want to transmit forbidden anything else that's very possible vlad was a cruel ruler intelligent and determined he could very well have made a deal with the devil so he would have lived to be sure but where would he be hiding in vladivista why not we're gonna go to vladivista the fox might have changed his den we're over a third of the way through the whole game
[172:23.39]It's a group founded by Heimrich von Kreuzberg on the ruins of the Golden Dawn, another secret society.
[172:29.68]Thule reached out to Professor von Bergen many times, but he couldn't bear them.
[172:33.99]He always kept his distance, and I followed his example.
[172:36.93]And I didn't know what even got bit.
[172:38.66]That one person got a dream stake in the heart.
[172:41.34]Openly, not in any roundabout way.
[172:43.38]They're very clever.
[172:44.11]I think it probably picks up in the second half.
[172:45.43]Very influential.
[172:46.57]I would never compromise myself with them.
[172:51.63]you know the hidden apocalypse yes here it is this page reveals the origin of the great war the assassination duke France ferdinand at Sarajevo the event that would submerge the world in horror had been announced centuries before in this book really this page you say
[173:12.82]Yes, and he decided to hide it in a New York Times crossword-style puzzle.
[173:21.85]He was a big fan of Highlights magazine.
[173:35.49]Two other terms.
[173:37.39]Okay.
[173:43.70]David.
[173:46.25]David.
[173:48.44]What?
[173:54.47]Everything's there.
[173:56.39]In 1914, in Sarajevo, the incident that caused the war occurred.
[174:00.98]It can't be a coincidence.
[174:08.32]That's so stupid.
[174:10.75]I can't believe you could... Okay.
[174:15.05]I thought it was David.
[174:18.26]Okay.
[174:27.85]Massacre.
[174:31.57]Something connected to massacre, like maim, torture, destroy.
[174:47.99]Solomon.
[174:54.37]Visrigus.
[175:05.01]Rump.
[175:16.70]Bam.
[175:18.48]Hemplar.
[175:35.62]Cranes.
[175:40.67]You know what I mean?
[175:46.02]Okay, uh, not that one.
[175:49.71]Dumb very dead.
[175:56.02]Immolate?
[175:56.54]Where do you see immolate?
[176:06.90]Immolate.
[176:09.23]I found it.
[176:15.26]I don't know.
[176:16.40]Oh, I need to use the microphone.
[176:19.65]No.
[176:24.14]Immolate.
[176:40.64]I don't even know how to select a word.
[176:42.66]Oh my God, I tried that.
[176:45.89]Why can I go left to?
[176:48.05]What?
[176:51.76]OK, it's not immolate.
[176:54.35]OK, I can't go left to right, but I can go right to left.
[177:14.05]Sin.
[177:22.56]Sacr... Sacr... Sacrificia.
[177:27.54]It's Italian.
[177:28.78]Sacrificia.
[177:30.81]Sacrificia.
[177:31.43]That's not it.
[177:40.76]Scripture.
[177:48.98]Are you giving up?
[177:51.26]So now everything is clear.
[177:53.25]At the instigation of the Thule Society, evil will triumph in Germany in 1936.
[177:57.33]And there will be massacres.
[178:00.93]So this prophecy is at the root of enormous trust of the Thule Society.
[178:06.24]It's just one element among many others.
[178:08.72]Believe me, those people have no notion of compassion.
[178:14.95]I think he just added fucking words.
[178:20.49]Uh.
[178:23.91]Do I have to do all of these pages?
[178:27.77]Or are these just here for fun?
[178:38.41]Uh, OK.
[178:40.17]So.
[178:42.17]I'm going to save it here and I'm done.
[178:53.59]I... I feel like I want to have a few beers and play this.
[178:59.80]I think that'd be more fun.
[179:04.15]I will say, if we're about 30-40% of the way through this game... Holy smokes, a whole lot of nothing has happened.
[179:11.33]They have to have the entire... We're going to get dumped with a shitload of stuff in the next hour or two.
[179:18.70]Dracula 1 was crazy.
[179:21.03]A bunch of wild shit happened in that game.
[179:23.11]Dracula 2 was even crazier.
[179:26.86]They turned this into an iPad hidden object game in the third one.
[179:33.33]Hold your reservations on it, though.
[179:40.84]Bush Light Dracula Sunday confirmed?
[179:43.40]Yes.
[179:44.60]I think that makes sense to me.
[179:49.89]Dracula 1 was talking to random villagers, to be fair.
[179:53.68]Yeah, but there was stuff to happen, though.
[179:55.52]Remember, like, if you pushed that guy in the water, you dropped that stack on that guy's head?
[180:02.31]There were monsters.
[180:03.79]Remember the monsters in that house?
[180:07.08]Four or five of those gargoyles attacked you, and you had, like, a timer, and you had to put the mirror?
[180:14.49]We'll see.
[180:21.01]But that'll be it for today.
[180:23.25]So tomorrow, here's the plan for tomorrow.
[180:26.01]We do have another scheduled Towerborn stream with the four of us.
[180:33.56]Which will be for two hours.
[180:35.23]And then after that, maybe Ster and I will do some White Knuckle stuff.
[180:39.13]That sounds fun.
[180:40.53]I want to see how he plays the game.
[180:46.82]And then on Sunday...
[180:49.71]We'll have a bush light Sunday.
[180:51.81]Maybe we'll get through Dracula 3.
[180:58.86]Kind of a tentative plan for now.
[181:05.41]I'm willing to give this the time that it probably deserves.
[181:07.79]I feel like we can't.
[181:09.70]I'm not going to stop playing Dracula 3 until we see Dracula.
[181:13.28]There's your promise.
[181:15.78]He's going to be in the game at some point, right?
[181:19.55]House Flipper Invitational Round 2 is currently tentatively scheduled for the 24th.
[181:30.59]That is the tentative schedule.
[181:37.93]And the 24th.
[181:40.54]is uh the 24th is Tuesday so this exactly one week from today we're going to finish the house slipper tournament fun day it was good to play games with the sponsor boys and then obviously um hey I'll tell you that was worth playing Dracula 3 just for the blood part they're like hey VOD watchers skip to the blood part that was probably the most fun
[182:21.17]It was charming, though.
[182:23.24]Probably a slow burn.
[182:24.24]I am looking forward to it.
[182:25.16]I really do think that it's going to pick up in the next two or three hours.
[182:29.80]It's got to, right?
[182:37.63]Take it easy.
[182:37.99]Take care of yourselves.
[182:38.69]Call your mother if you haven't.
[182:41.01]See you guys tomorrow, probably starting around the same time.
[182:45.02]If the time changes, I'll let you know, but we'll start with the four of us.
[182:51.75]to win Towerborn.
[182:53.05]Which I'm curious how much harder that game's going to get.
[182:58.69]We'll see.
[182:59.79]Seems like we kind of opened it up after the first couple hours.
[183:01.77]We'll check it out.
[183:03.24]Sponsored again, of course, and I will see you tomorrow.
[183:08.77]Take care.
[183:10.03]Have a great night.
[183:11.47]See you soon.
[183:23.32]you
[183:58.22]you
[184:33.09]you
