[ve:61.7.100]

[00:00.89]Good afternoon.
[00:07.08]Sorry, I am a few minutes late.
[00:09.10]I had some car trouble that I had to take care of.
[00:12.62]And I just finished it all.
[00:16.79]So I'm ready to go.
[00:21.97]Oh, hold on.
[00:26.99]Yeah, it's just, it was annoying, annoying stuff.
[00:31.98]Let's just leave it at that.
[00:39.52]I drive my car every day.
[00:43.15]Sometimes run into a problem.
[00:47.99]Well, I don't drive every single day, right?
[00:50.57]But, you know, on most days, I drive my car.
[00:58.84]I'm the rumor.
[01:02.15]Yeah, I do this thing where I attach like a loud noise to the back of my muffler.
[01:09.42]And even when I'm going like 32 miles per hour, it goes... I thought it was cool.
[01:27.83]Anyways, I hope you're having a good day.
[01:29.13]Hope you're having a good start to your week here.
[01:33.98]I have been compiling some FMV full motion video games for the last, I don't know, probably a few weeks.
[01:45.47]And we're gonna do it for the next few days.
[01:49.59]We're gonna start today with the animated stuff.
[01:53.22]I've actually never played Dragon's Lair ever.
[01:57.76]This is one of the most iconic classic video games ever made.
[02:01.60]I've never played it.
[02:03.14]Ever.
[02:04.62]I've only seen, I think, like 12 seconds of this game's animation.
[02:11.46]There's a Dragon's Lair 2.
[02:15.28]I mean, why not?
[02:19.52]There are the Space Ace.
[02:23.11]And then there's another game called Kingdom.
[02:26.49]And there's another one too.
[02:27.15]There's two Kingdoms.
[02:29.69]And most of these are on Steam.
[02:31.37]I didn't even know these games were on Steam.
[02:35.35]They, like, remade these games.
[02:37.13]And I didn't even know this.
[02:41.90]So, depending on how long this takes, we're just going to go through the animated stuff today.
[02:46.04]And then tomorrow, I'm going to try to get the other ones to work too.
[02:51.12]You will know if I ran into a bunch of technical problems later tonight into tomorrow.
[02:57.24]Because we'll be playing Greedfall tomorrow if I can't figure it out.
[03:05.99]Which I don't want to do.
[03:10.79]Because... Why do I not want to do that?
[03:15.85]Because Greedfall looks really great on paper.
[03:21.41]But apparently it's a very slow-paced game.
[03:24.67]Lots of dialog.
[03:26.35]And you know how my attention span is about... I have the attention span of a cube worth of cheese.
[03:32.92]You know what I mean?
[03:33.86]That's all I got.
[03:37.36]Because I go for it and whack.
[03:44.07]Anyways, let's get started.
[03:44.87]This is Dragon's Lair.
[03:55.17]Oh, I just like... I laughed at my own shitty joke.
[03:59.36]And it hurt me.
[04:03.76]It's got good music.
[04:04.50]Let's get the music on here so you can hear it.
[04:10.20]I have Joke Thorns.
[04:11.64]Yeah, but wouldn't that mean that I... No.
[04:23.53]And... Hey!
[04:25.89]Dragons of Lair, presented by Don Bluth.
[04:31.26]I think this game only takes... Like 40 minutes to beat.
[04:35.82]But it's ridiculously difficult, is what I've heard.
[04:40.12]this is a make a choice within a tenth of a second and lose so the actual video game is about 30 minutes long but it might take like three hours to do this I don't know I'm just setting myself up for for what I think might happen are you ready are we ready for the opening cutscene
[05:11.18]Jerma's not good at games either.
[05:12.70]I've never heard- I've heard of this game.
[05:16.58]I've seen the mouth animations, and I was like, holy shit, those are pretty good, like, mouth animations.
[05:21.59]You ready?
[05:24.37]Three.
[05:26.13]Alright, start over.
[05:27.79]One.
[05:29.11]Go.
[05:30.93]Oh god.
[05:32.25]L- Lives.
[05:35.36]Three.
[05:37.54]Five.
[05:38.20]I can't do more than five.
[05:41.37]Play the original scene order from the Arcade Cabinet.
[05:43.93]Dirk will start in a new scene if he dies.
[05:47.71]Uh... Yeah, that's... How do I do that one?
[05:51.43]What is Move Beeps?
[05:55.19]Move Guide?
[05:55.99]Arcade Cabinet.
[05:58.03]On or off?
[05:58.55]Probably off.
[05:59.09]Mode Arcade.
[06:01.21]Difficulty?
[06:02.33]We're gonna keep it on... Hard!
[06:13.30]This mode features more moves and requires quicker reactions for certain scenes.
[06:16.30]Good luck.
[06:19.36]Turn it all off.
[06:20.62]What do you mean?
[06:21.12]No, I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing.
[06:22.52]I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing.
[06:28.46]I'm not turning off this shit.
[06:29.61]I have no idea what's going on.
[06:30.99]Alright, I'm going for it.
[06:32.55]You ready?
[06:32.89]I'm not turning the move guide off.
[06:43.11]To play Dragon's Lair, you'll need to make the correct move at the right time.
[06:48.23]In this scene, Dirk will fall through the drawbridge.
[06:56.81]It's time to make a move!
[06:58.59]To survive... I couldn't even read that!
[07:03.31]I'm dead.
[07:09.52]To play Dragon's Lair, you need to make the correct move at the right time.
[07:11.88]I'm not going to be able to beat this.
[07:15.02]In this scene, Dirk will fall through the drawbridge, and you have to swing the s- okay, so there's a sword.
[07:19.43]Can I- do I have to press it with my mouse?
[07:24.41]Touch the sword button.
[07:25.37]Okay, yeah.
[07:31.89]Got it.
[07:35.42]Come on, you made the correct move.
[07:36.68]I did.
[07:38.45]Can I- I can't do like up, down, left, right?
[07:40.45]I'm gonna misclick so many fucking times.
[07:43.19]Throughout the game, you'll need to make up, down, left, right, and sword- What the fuck?
[07:46.57]Slow down!
[07:47.11]Alright.
[07:54.32]What?
[07:54.60]Why is it starting from the beginning?
[08:02.95]Okay.
[08:04.61]Jump!
[08:05.49]Uh-oh.
[08:08.64]Okay, got that one.
[08:09.20]That one.
[08:11.06]And this one.
[08:13.34]Made it.
[08:16.56]What happened?
[08:22.34]Wait, what is going... What the fuck?
[08:27.86]I have no idea what's going on!
[08:29.68]Why have I started at random places?
[08:35.35]Why did I start at a random place?
[08:37.37]I have no idea what just happened.
[08:46.17]Now I'm in arcade mode?
[08:51.23]Why did I fly through the house?
[08:56.31]That was fucking ridiculous.
[09:00.15]I just angry burst into the castle wall.
[09:02.89]Okay, hold on a minute.
[09:04.55]New game.
[09:04.91]Dirk will start in a new scene if he dies.
[09:09.31]Okay.
[09:17.29]There we are.
[09:18.03]Now this makes fucking sense.
[09:26.28]Here we go.
[09:26.72]We're doing the laser disk version.
[09:28.06]I'm ready.
[09:32.90]Turn the volume down?
[09:34.22]Is it on?
[09:36.38]Okay, this part, it's the squid.
[09:45.90]Okay.
[09:47.38]Then I go in the door.
[09:49.04]Here's the... From this door.
[09:54.05]I made it, right?
[09:55.35]What?
[09:57.33]I thought I did.
[09:57.87]I pressed the button?
[10:02.73]Guys, I think I might have to put this on easy.
[10:12.78]You have to press it twice.
[10:14.30]Okay.
[10:17.48]So then it gets us into this room.
[10:18.68]The rocks fall.
[10:19.82]Gotta go to the right.
[10:22.40]Got it.
[10:26.48]And now it's a bed.
[10:27.62]Okay.
[10:40.91]It's too fast.
[10:43.17]It's happening too fast.
[10:53.22]I just keep killing him.
[10:55.10]Oh, here we go.
[10:56.74]Quickly through the door.
[10:57.38]Okay, so you have to dive through.
[11:01.14]Drink me.
[11:01.52]I can't.
[11:10.03]Don't drink.
[11:21.25]I can't take it.
[11:22.55]I can't.
[11:24.75]Let's try it again.
[11:26.89]We're in the drink me room.
[11:30.41]Don't drink.
[11:31.29]Wait, go this way.
[11:32.79]Watch out.
[11:34.93]Hmm.
[11:40.15]I gotta wait?
[11:40.95]Slash?
[11:41.45]No, I gotta run.
[11:45.89]Slash.
[11:46.89]Up.
[11:48.58]Slash.
[11:49.70]Right.
[11:51.42]Slash.
[11:55.68]Got it.
[11:57.88]Straight.
[11:59.02]Straight.
[12:00.10]Straight.
[12:02.97]That sucks.
[12:04.63]Straight.
[12:06.21]Straight.
[12:09.60]and over and this is like trying to remember a dream
[12:27.82]You know when you have a fucking nightmare, and during the nightmare, it's completely vivid, everything is happening in real time.
[12:36.23]Right when you wake up from the nightmare, this is what it's like remembering the dream.
[12:44.51]It's like, what?
[12:45.05]And then I, I got hit in the head with a fucking rake, and then I was, it was lava, and then I got killed, and I fell down the stairs, and, wait, I forget, I kind of don't remember.
[12:53.33]Get the gold?
[13:00.69]How many times do I have to go around in a circle?
[13:06.29]Alright, right.
[13:14.56]Right.
[13:17.24]And straight.

[13:49.23]Kill it!
[13:49.97]Kill it quick!
[13:58.09]Oh my god, this is too intense.
[14:06.33]I gotta go up.
[14:11.21]This is super fast-paced.
[14:12.63]It really is.
[14:13.19]It's like a thousand miles per hour.
[14:15.57]Alright, it's slash and then up.
[14:21.06]Go.
[14:22.40]Grab an axe.
[14:31.30]And then right.

[14:59.68]Okay.
[15:00.02]Holy shit.
[15:04.86]Just go up the stairs?
[15:13.89]Go this way, quick!
[15:25.33]Thank god there are continues, otherwise I would never complete this.
[15:37.40]Turn off the continues.
[15:39.98]You really want me to do that shit?
[15:42.80]Are you sure about that?
[15:43.68]Oh, fuck.
[15:54.83]No continues on easy.
[15:56.33]And then up.
[15:59.29]And then right.
[16:01.96]And then up.
[16:19.38]It's too much.
[16:21.32]It's ADHD.
[16:22.40]It's like super ADHD.
[16:25.72]I don't even remember the last thing I saw.
[16:28.19]It was a spider.
[16:30.03]Why wouldn't the spider kill me?
[16:38.37]Use the arrow keys and space bar.
[16:39.95]Does that work?
[16:48.55]Holy shit, it does.
[16:49.39]Wow, thank you.
[16:50.03]I go right, up, and then left.
[16:53.40]Slash.

[17:27.81]Left.
[17:28.19]Now what?
[17:29.79]One hit.
[17:58.90]The two second deaths are the funniest.
[18:01.84]Shit.
[18:06.94]It's up.
[18:07.70]Down.
[18:08.14]Which one do I go to?
[18:09.30]Which one do I go to?
[18:40.89]This is the beginning of the game.
[18:47.27]It's the Homer Simpson!
[18:49.95]Okay, what if I continue?
[18:51.45]I don't want to continue from here.
[18:55.17]Okay, now I'm gonna continue and it's not gonna be from there, right?
[19:12.84]oh god damn it alright well I should remember all this no I don't
[19:42.97]I don't even feel like I'm screaming.
[19:45.47]I feel like I'm on drugs.
[19:49.73]I make these noises during streams.
[19:51.52]That's why it's freaking me out.
[19:53.88]I made that noise at the beginning of the stream.
[19:56.86]That was the first noise I made.
[19:58.10]Deep boulders.
[20:02.04]I don't have a thing.
[20:14.27]We need rapids.
[20:16.27]Okay, left, right, left.
[20:19.63]When the shower is too hot.
[20:47.06]Now what?
[20:47.38]Oh, I'm back up here.
[20:50.04]Okay, go!
[20:54.94]Come on!
[20:58.06]Where the fuck am I?
[21:01.82]What?
[21:10.14]This is just the Sonic the Hedgehog room.
[21:13.39]From Sonic 3D Blast.
[21:15.69]Yeah, I played it.
[21:33.08]What?
[21:36.20]I thought I was gonna get in the face by one of those things.
[21:41.16]Why did I just get scooped up by like a...
[21:44.54]Octopus.
[21:45.06]Hold on.
[21:45.52]This guy sucks.
[22:00.76]This guy sucks.
[22:04.65]He's the worst.
[22:06.75]What is this guy's name?
[22:08.09]Dick Dastardly Richard?
[22:16.87]Alright, straight.
[22:18.41]Straight.
[22:20.17]No?
[22:20.65]It's sword.
[22:21.07]Sword, probably.
[22:24.82]Sword.
[22:26.62]Good.
[22:26.90]Sword.
[22:29.72]It's sword.
[22:30.16]Sword.
[22:47.17]Now what?
[22:54.59]Did I just get an enchantment?
[22:57.89]I just got Dark Souls.
[23:02.13]That happens all the time.
[23:04.33]You opened up a chest.
[23:05.25]I got a new weapon.
[23:17.64]Okay, here we go.
[23:22.52]Got it.
[23:24.66]How many rooms are there?
[23:28.47]Don't drink it!
[23:28.93]Got it.
[23:30.05]Made it to the puke room.
[23:35.37]Hmm.
[23:52.04]This game is fucking wonderful.
[23:54.18]What a wonderful game.
[23:55.34]Oh shit.
[24:08.41]Imagine doing this all in... Yeah, I can't imagine doing this all in one sitting with one quarter without the guide.
[24:14.91]You know what?
[24:18.05]I'm turning the guide off.
[24:20.86]No, wait, wait, wait.
[24:21.58]I'm turning the guide off.
[24:23.92]I think it's time.
[24:24.80]I understand the game now.
[24:32.91]I'm going for it.
[24:38.99]Move guide off.
[24:40.65]Move beeps!
[24:41.15]I'm going to keep move beeps on.
[24:42.51]We're going to put it on easy.
[24:47.92]Easy.
[24:52.55]Easy move guide off.
[24:54.37]I'm going for it.
[24:58.81]What does Arcade Cabinet mean?
[24:59.86]Hey, I'm going to do five lives.
[25:03.50]No.
[25:04.44]This infinity continues.
[25:11.30]Five lives?
[25:20.40]It's just a border.
[25:21.08]Okay.
[25:21.42]I think that's fine.
[25:22.94]I'm ready.
[25:23.26]Let's go.
[25:25.39]I'm doing it.
[25:25.91]Let's do it.
[25:26.39]I get it.
[25:26.77]I understand how the game works.
[25:38.33]Oh, fuck.
[25:39.95]That doesn't tell me when I do move either.
[25:41.89]Okay, then we go straight.
[25:45.73]Right, then we go right.
[25:48.82]Right twice.
[25:49.24]Okay.
[25:52.52]We're gonna go left.
[25:54.50]Left.
[25:59.29]Got it.
[26:00.41]What?
[26:12.25]So what happened?
[26:15.17]What's this?
[26:21.99]What's going on here?
[26:26.91]What?
[26:27.83]It's not left?
[26:28.59]Go?
[26:29.99]Go.
[26:32.51]Okay, got it.
[26:38.43]Get the fucking mouse off the screen.
[26:40.43]Don't drink that.
[26:53.75]It's alright, let's go.
[26:55.19]Let's do it.
[26:55.81]Continue.
[26:56.93]I got infinite continues.
[26:58.05]I got infinite money.
[27:00.09]I brought right to my right is a sack of quarters.
[27:02.36]There's like 60 bucks in quarters over here.
[27:06.04]Hmm.
[27:07.38]Forward?
[27:08.64]Forward?
[27:10.04]No, it's forward slash.
[27:10.96]Hmm.
[27:13.84]Hmm.
[27:17.45]I'm forward.
[27:18.71]Forward again.
[27:20.46]Shit, no, it's slash.
[27:24.56]Forward slash.
[27:28.54]Forward.
[27:30.10]Slash.
[27:30.47]Got it.
[27:53.16]Hey mister, can you get off?
[27:54.22]Me and my friends want to play.
[27:55.22]How old are you anyway?
[27:56.06]34!
[27:56.36]Hey, I have every right to be here just like you do.
[28:25.62]What?
[28:26.30]Is it left?
[28:34.77]Slash.
[28:35.95]Left?
[28:36.87]Yep, it's left.
[28:38.13]Slash.
[28:39.33]Forward.
[28:43.33]Good.
[28:46.09]Okay, now we gotta go... Again, forward.
[28:54.65]Alright, Sonic the Hedgehog room.
[28:55.73]I remember this.
[28:57.13]Down.
[29:00.85]Down again.
[29:04.71]You can hear the pins roll.
[29:08.39]What?
[29:08.71]What the fuck was that?
[29:20.94]That was bullshit.
[29:23.09]Alright, wait.
[29:25.37]Now go.
[29:32.12]What the fuck?!
[29:33.90]Is it- is it- it might be left or right then.
[29:51.40]It's not left.
[29:52.20]It's not down.
[29:53.14]It's not right.
[29:55.74]Which one is it?
[29:56.32]Is it jump?
[30:00.22]I'm doing it too early.
[30:01.10]Well, he gets killed in the animation.
[30:06.63]I mean, the timing is here.
[30:10.61]Now.
[30:12.61]Now.
[30:14.69]Now.
[30:15.45]See?
[30:16.05]What the fuck?
[30:22.16]It's not down.
[30:23.44]I think it's left.
[30:26.38]It's left.
[30:43.79]I need- I gotta make something real clear.
[30:45.35]The ding, guys, is when I'm pressing the button at the right time.
[30:51.84]You understand?
[30:54.02]Do you understand?
[30:55.50]Okay.
[30:56.72]Okay, good.
[31:01.13]Left!
[31:15.25]Oh, come on!
[31:16.19]What the fuck?
[31:21.98]No!
[31:23.54]I had it!
[31:27.34]It's not, it's not the ding!
[31:29.28]Hey, it's not the ding.
[31:32.74]Oh my god, okay, I'm gonna lose it forever.
[31:44.15]Just do the ding.
[31:48.29]Dude, you have to press it when it dings.
[31:49.75]I'm the one creating the dings.
[32:03.22]Jump!
[32:04.64]I did it.
[32:04.92]Don't tell me I didn't do anything.
[32:08.92]Slash right.
[32:15.41]I didn't fucking get it.
[32:19.76]Now it's slack.
[32:20.50]Got it.
[32:21.28]It's right when the scene transitions.
[32:22.60]And then down.
[32:45.79]Down, then up.
[32:48.13]Up.
[32:52.33]Slash him.
[32:54.63]Um, wait.
[32:55.37]Now.
[32:57.03]Slash again.
[32:58.97]And then right, left.
[33:01.83]And then... Hmm.
[33:02.15]I don't know when I fucked it up.
[33:12.73]Do I lose points for fucking it up?
[33:19.28]Then up, and then we have to wait.
[33:21.02]I do the thing and then here it comes.
[33:28.74]I don't remember this one.
[33:29.78]It's the sludge.
[33:41.17]There's two of these games, by the way, if you didn't know.
[33:49.20]Up?
[33:49.96]It's probably left.
[33:50.42]No.
[33:50.72]What?
[33:51.06]Up.
[33:51.28]Yep, and then... Right?
[33:52.38]No.
[33:53.10]Okay, I have to kill that thing.
[34:09.24]Got it?
[34:10.32]Fuck, and then it's immediately to the right.
[34:11.50]Yeah, this was in the arcade.
[34:16.40]I miss this kind of shit.
[34:17.60]I really do.
[34:20.46]No!
[34:20.82]Nooooo.
[34:27.83]So it's up slash down?
[34:29.37]I think it's probably down.
[34:32.85]This stuff, this is just so goofy.
[34:34.23]This shit's so stupid.
[34:35.26]I love it.
[34:38.27]Oh shit.
[34:42.56]And then right?
[34:43.64]Yep.
[34:45.64]Ow.
[34:47.90]But was it 50 cents?
[34:52.12]Was it a quarter?
[34:52.82]How many lives did you get?
[34:58.82]Well, somebody will count how many times I've died, and we can count by 50 cents.
[35:11.61]I miss being cheated out of my money.
[35:13.49]Why does he stop pursuing me?
[35:20.25]Got it.
[35:47.05]It's forward into the pool, right?
[35:48.41]From what I remember.
[35:49.06]Stop.
[35:58.38]What?
[35:59.15]How is that not correct?
[36:00.23]It's left.
[36:03.37]What?
[36:03.67]It is left.
[36:13.48]Oh, it's because this is different.
[36:15.18]It's mirrored.
[36:16.00]It was on the right side last time.
[36:17.70]Okay.
[36:39.11]So you don't ju- Is it not a jump over?
[36:40.97]I've tried jumping over twice.
[36:48.74]There's such a long line of kids behind you.
[36:52.06]Get out of here!
[36:55.78]Um, excuse me, manager?
[36:57.26]There's a guy over at the dragon's lair machine and he smells.
[37:01.00]Shut up!
[37:02.24]Out.
[37:03.36]Forward.
[37:03.80]I had it.
[37:05.64]Shit.
[37:29.00]And then forward?
[37:30.80]Yep.
[37:31.34]Forward.
[37:32.12]I just... What the fuck?
[37:37.40]I just watched it happen.
[37:39.54]And then it's forward again.
[37:44.37]Slash.
[37:46.29]Forward.
[37:47.97]Got it.
[38:00.08]There we go, boss fight.
[38:01.46]Oh, this is gonna be hell.
[38:02.66]This is gonna be absolute hell without the guy.
[38:06.30]Uh-oh.
[38:07.08]I think it's up.
[38:26.88]Save me!
[38:28.02]No, it's left.
[38:29.60]Save me!
[38:31.38]Okay, you gotta wait.
[38:33.24]It's left and then right.
[38:35.19]Save me!
[38:47.80]Sir, the arcade's closing for the day.
[38:49.54]Can you please leave?
[38:52.62]I want to give him a handshake.
[38:57.32]And there's a $100 bill in my hand.
[38:59.38]It's got one of these lights on it.
[39:05.13]Sir.
[39:05.65]Save me.
[39:16.19]It's left, right, it is up, I think.
[39:20.81]Left, right, up, down?
[39:28.42]Left, right, up, down?
[39:30.74]Shit.
[39:31.30]Okay, it's left, right, left, right, up, left?
[39:37.98]Left, right, up, right.
[39:45.51]No.
[39:46.15]Left, right, up, right.
[39:49.32]And then left, left, and then down.
[39:53.76]Up.
[39:54.00]It's too much.
[40:11.49]Oh my god.
[40:17.24]I can't.
[40:18.60]Alright, I got it, I got it, I'll be good.
[40:21.94]Left, right, up.
[40:23.34]No!
[40:25.32]It's up.
[40:53.19]I just pressed right.
[40:55.89]You got this little window to do it.
[40:57.99]God damn it.
[41:04.93]Oh my god, you can't spam it.
[41:06.09]Somebody said spam the directions, but you can't.
[41:11.30]Kill him!
[41:13.54]I'm good.
[41:38.83]It's right?
[41:39.39]I think it's back
[42:08.64]That's not left!
[42:09.42]How is it not left?
[42:10.82]You have to jump over, right?
[42:14.08]Too early?
[42:18.99]I can't just jump in there?
[42:21.29]Okay, it's down.
[42:25.97]I thought I tried down.
[42:38.94]Okay, I remember this part.
[42:48.56]Go forward.
[42:49.01]I remember this one.
[42:50.73]Oh, this is bad.
[42:51.31]Oh!
[42:51.45]Oh!
[42:51.53]Oh!
[42:51.71]Oh!
[42:51.83]Oh!
[42:55.03]Oh!
[43:08.93]Shit, I had it too.
[43:11.17]Oh well.
[43:11.77]You gotta wait till the fire comes up.
[43:18.87]Did I do it?
[43:26.71]I did it!
[43:27.05]Alright, new content.
[43:37.47]Oh, you asshole.
[43:38.43]It's white.
[43:40.19]How am I up here?
[43:41.51]Wait, how did I get back to this room?
[43:48.23]Is it the elevator?
[43:54.68]It just goes in a random order.
[43:55.86]Oh, okay.
[43:56.78]Hmm.
[44:10.64]Okay.
[44:11.64]Then... Now we're down the elevator again!
[44:16.48]Forward?
[44:22.17]I... I just tried to go up!
[44:42.54]It's up.
[44:51.67]Somebody count.
[44:52.25]I want to know how much money I've spent here.
[44:56.19]Okay.
[44:58.17]Go.
[44:58.45]Go.
[45:11.73]Oh no, not this shit!
[45:13.19]I have to- oh my god, this is gonna be hell.
[45:18.09]This is gonna be horrible.
[45:19.92]Remember, this was like, slash, run, run, run, slash.
[45:25.08]Oh no.
[45:27.22]Left?
[45:29.66]Oh my god.
[45:44.08]So it's mirrored from last time.
[45:45.52]So it's left... I think it's left over and over again.
[45:56.59]Left again.
[45:57.03]Huh?
[45:57.23]What?
[46:14.56]God.
[46:15.42]I didn't even have a chance to see where the sword was going.
[46:23.92]Right again.
[46:24.26]And then left.
[46:55.46]Right again.
[46:58.34]Right.
[46:58.86]Okay.
[46:59.30]Then it's right again.
[47:00.16]And then it's straight.
[47:02.86]Left.
[47:05.00]Right.
[47:06.42]Right.
[47:08.62]Grab.
[47:10.38]Swing.
[47:15.67]Holy shit.
[47:16.55]There was a left and a right in there, guys.
[47:17.97]And I fucking guessed wildly and I got it.
[47:19.91]That was not just space.
[47:20.79]That was left and...
[47:28.52]I have to do this shit again.
[47:34.84]Just on the other... It's a mirror against the screen.
[47:38.56]Does the game end?
[47:39.36]Hmm.
[47:40.00]I don't know if the game ever ends.
[47:44.15]Oh, goddammit.
[47:46.67]Hmm.
[47:57.27]And then it's right.
[48:01.67]I need to learn how to use the elevator.
[48:02.95]Hmm.
[48:05.09]Where am I supposed to be going in the elevator?
[48:06.97]What the fuck?
[48:13.92]Is it not left or right?
[48:15.48]It should be right.
[48:17.54]Isn't it just mirrored?
[48:20.56]Hmm.
[48:27.66]Maybe it's forward.
[48:29.78]No.
[48:31.64]I've tried up, left, and right on the envelope.
[48:39.61]Hmm.
[48:39.69]What the fuck?
[48:57.00]It'll punish you for doing things too early.
[49:00.52]That's the only frames I have there.
[49:03.12]Watch, ready?
[49:08.33]Maybe wait till it gets up?
[49:09.83]Oh, alright.
[49:15.41]What the fuck?
[49:17.63]I don't remember that.
[49:19.03]What do I do?
[49:21.55]And then... Oh yeah, okay.
[49:25.48]The statue.
[49:31.48]Now what?
[49:35.54]These guys died so many times.
[49:39.53]Okay, it's slash and then right up the stairs.
[49:42.01]Right now?
[49:45.57]What?
[49:46.51]No, it's up to the axe.
[49:55.83]And then... Shit.
[49:57.57]Okay, it's up and then right.
[49:59.11]I thought it was up and then slash.
[50:21.12]You have to go all the way around and then up the stairs And then over go hurry up go what are you doing?
[50:37.63]I just pressed this
[50:48.12]So on the stairs, do I have to jump to the left?
[50:50.48]Because it's not Slash.
[50:51.98]I don't remember.
[50:52.60]Oh, come on.
[50:56.49]And then up, and then go left.
[51:02.87]Yep, and then up.
[51:05.67]Then up.
[51:08.20]Okay, good.
[51:18.23]Oh shit!
[51:22.66]I have to fight.
[51:23.16]Alright, I gotta fight him.
[51:33.56]Slash and then he gets run.
[51:36.70]Got it.
[51:37.06]Cool.
[51:39.64]Up.
[51:40.24]Again.
[51:40.70]Okay.
[51:42.58]Now here comes another Elevator.
[51:43.90]See?
[51:51.18]Up?
[51:52.68]Okay, so it's two ups.
[51:59.86]Three ups?
[52:00.34]Switch and go right?
[52:02.37]He wasn't even done landing yet!
[52:14.59]He wasn't even done landing.
[52:16.42]Dude.
[52:26.54]So it's a double tap, you gotta go up up.
[52:33.94]And then again.
[52:35.72]It's bats.
[52:39.98]Slash?
[52:40.46]Or maybe duck?
[52:41.41]I wonder.
[52:52.78]And it's probably slash.
[52:54.35]The bats coming.
[52:55.55]Yep.
[52:55.87]Slash.
[52:56.61]Right.
[52:58.45]Right again.
[53:00.25]Go.
[53:01.85]Bats.
[53:02.53]Right.
[53:02.85]Slash.
[53:03.51]Left.
[53:07.77]It's probably... I don't know.
[53:14.19]Slash?
[53:16.61]It's slash.
[53:17.53]And then it's left.
[53:19.21]And then we go...
[53:27.11]What is that?
[53:27.83]What's that?
[53:28.99]Oh, god damn it.
[53:35.09]So that's also a slash.
[53:36.63]I'm happy you might have to run back up the stairs.
[53:40.25]Jump.
[53:40.49]Slash.
[53:41.05]Left.
[53:42.81]Got it.
[53:45.11]Oh, boy.
[53:45.43]Here we go.
[54:00.16]I have no idea what happened.
[54:03.74]I'm gonna say jump or slash.
[54:07.33]Probably forward, right?
[54:08.53]Or right?
[54:29.30]I don't know when to do this.
[54:30.58]So it's definitely slash when I turn around.
[54:55.04]So that doesn't work.
[54:57.24]So try the swing.
[54:59.12]Maybe try swinging twice before it falls?
[55:01.26]We'll probably jump.
[55:03.97]Oh, come on.
[55:05.09]That window is so tiny.
[55:31.50]I probably have to run down or right.
[55:33.78]After the sword.
[55:34.47]Nope.
[55:34.77]It's not down.
[56:00.90]Too early, when it goes that's where they kill you.
[56:07.30]So swing twice?
[56:09.20]Because you get surrounded.
[56:32.90]How the fuck do I get away from that?
[56:38.22]Jump?
[56:41.28]I... What the fuck?
[56:45.19]Forward, I don't... It's up.
[56:46.57]It's up.
[56:49.25]I have to go...
[56:59.28]So when they get in front of you, you go up and then up again or left?
[57:02.18]Oh god, this is gonna be fucking horrible.
[57:19.46]The new Cuphead looks hard.
[57:20.68]I think it's left.
[57:25.62]Yeah, it looks left.
[57:35.60]Damn it.
[57:42.42]Did I beat Cuphead?
[57:43.72]Yeah, I did.
[57:45.28]I beat that like the first day it came out.
[58:01.10]I almost wanna s- I wanna screenshot that area.
[58:03.44]Fuck.
[58:04.06]Is it- I- I tried right, I tried left, maybe I should try down.
[58:32.03]It looks like left is the waterfall but then I go in the waterfall and it kills me.
[58:37.01]So I need to know where to go and the right exact moment to press the button.
[59:01.60]Nope.
[59:02.46]Too bad I don't have a sword.
[59:03.82]The sword doesn't work!
[59:04.82]Alright, up.
[59:06.34]Okay.
[59:25.60]It's up again!
[59:27.56]It's right!
[59:28.50]It's left!
[59:28.92]Holy shit!
[59:29.93]Okay, my god.
[59:31.15]It's up, it's right, and then it's left.
[59:32.81]But you have to do it at the exact moment.
[59:47.11]No!
[59:51.62]Is it up again?
[59:52.30]I think it might be up again.
[59:53.82]It's not left.
[59:54.46]Oh my god, this place sucks.
[59:56.06]It's up.
[59:56.64]And... I...
[60:11.07]Oh no, I gotta memorize that.
[60:18.40]Oh come on, I swung.
[60:27.25]Fuck.
[60:28.63]I'm probably so close to the end.
[60:31.11]I have to beat it.
[60:38.56]I just pressed it!
[60:43.35]I just pressed it!
[60:48.73]Oh my god.
[60:49.59]Do I have to wait another tenth of a second before I can press it?
[61:10.03]Oh my- No!
[61:10.83]That's it!
[61:11.21]I didn't press anything!
[61:12.21]He just died!
[61:12.67]I think it's- I gotta go earlier than that.
[61:19.63]Yeah, it's earlier than that.
[61:24.30]And then up.
[61:27.44]And then left.
[61:29.06]I don't fucking know!
[61:41.47]I'm gonna wait.
[61:54.69]Maybe it's up again.
[61:55.39]No, but wouldn't up just go right into the lava?
[62:10.59]I feel like that would just jump in the lava.
[62:12.30]Got it.
[62:12.54]Come on.
[62:13.00]Again?
[62:13.32]It's again?
[62:13.86]Okay.
[62:14.18]No!
[62:15.08]I don't know what it would have been.
[62:16.68]Is it a swing?
[62:17.50]Ugh.
[62:44.20]It's definitely not spring because I can't kill them.
[62:46.52]Up again.
[62:49.66]It's up again.
[62:50.80]I did it!
[63:07.71]Oh, no, no, no, what do I do in the elevator?
[63:08.99]What do I do in the elevator?
[63:09.69]So stop, what?
[63:10.90]Stop, like... What's the elevator tactic?
[63:18.96]Wait for two?
[63:19.52]Wait for one?
[63:21.90]One, two, I'm just going on two?
[63:31.79]No, no, no, I don't want to...
[63:38.09]What the fuck?
[63:40.11]I don't know what to do.
[63:54.14]Oh, this is new.
[63:58.13]Okay, this is the boulders.
[64:02.21]Now I have to dodge the boulders.
[64:14.08]You gotta do it much quicker than that.
[64:15.44]This is a long string too.
[64:21.23]Okay, rapids.
[64:41.06]Oh, no.
[64:43.18]This is going to be bad.
[64:44.66]I'm going to fucking start this section over like 25 times, I think, man.
[64:50.16]Because that first one was up.
[64:53.58]Okay, up and then left.
[64:59.57]Up, left.
[65:03.59]Up.
[65:04.07]Left.
[65:11.90]Okay.
[65:12.84]Okay, whirlwinds.
[65:14.36]This is right.
[65:15.12]Just gotta avoid the whirlwinds.
[65:16.67]Fuck, I must have screwed it up.
[65:25.39]Alright, that's it.
[65:28.67]Ooh, I forgot to grab the chain.
[65:29.83]Alright, I'm good.
[65:33.58]Now what?
[65:47.10]I think I have to duck.
[65:49.04]Or go to the right.
[65:54.03]Wait.
[65:57.54]No, right is spikes.
[65:59.50]Left.
[66:14.69]You have to dodge right.
[66:16.47]It says right.
[66:17.75]It's left.
[66:19.73]Whatever the fuck it is.
[66:27.74]Damn it.
[66:28.10]I didn't find it right.
[66:29.75]I tried to go to the right.
[66:31.91]You gotta do really early for that third one.
[66:55.03]Ooh, first try of that one.
[66:56.87]Alright, save me.
[66:57.47]I'm going.
[67:04.92]Is that a... Did I grab the diamond?
[67:15.46]Is this a new room?
[67:16.44]Alright, slash twice?
[67:19.71]Yep.
[67:21.85]It's slash, slash, and... Oh, shit, then it's up.
[67:24.23]You keep climbing up.
[67:33.68]How am I keeping up with what's happening?
[67:36.08]Um... Well, the answer is no.
[67:39.16]Okay.
[67:40.21]I know that wasn't a yes or no question, but... It was.
[67:43.77]Kind of.
[67:47.42]Now what?
[67:55.28]Into the hole?
[67:56.66]Slash the hole?
[67:58.46]Watch out.
[68:04.72]And get out.
[68:05.96]Nice.
[68:06.86]No, not this again!
[68:14.68]up twice and then right.
[68:19.27]Slash the spider.
[68:21.01]Get in.
[68:22.61]Okay.
[68:23.43]Get...
[68:40.87]It was up and I fucked it up.
[68:42.11]Save me!
[68:42.91]Save me!
[69:07.35]Oh my god, I hate this room because I know what it is, but it's flipped.
[69:12.46]I've memorized it from last time.
[69:23.92]I did it!
[69:24.74]I pressed it!
[69:25.40]I pressed up!
[69:40.14]What?
[70:01.54]Fuck you!
[70:01.84]I made it to the throne room!
[70:36.53]Okay, right up.
[70:50.22]Sir, we just got a notification that you just took out $100,000 to beat Dragon's Lair.
[70:59.04]Right.
[71:00.55]Well, it's alright.
[71:01.19]I'm gonna be able to pay that back.
[71:03.15]This shit ain't gonna take more than $75.
[71:14.85]Right.
[71:15.41]What was that?
[71:17.41]Did you hear that noise?
[71:19.15]I beat it!
[71:19.61]It's the end.
[71:20.57]The dragon.
[71:23.78]Am I trying to left or up?
[71:33.90]Do I grab?
[71:34.68]Swing?
[71:56.75]Am I doing that to the dragon?
[72:00.59]I'm gonna do right instead.
[72:06.24]I tried left, I tried up.
[72:21.63]Swing?
[72:22.01]Maybe down.
[72:23.41]I'm trying to make... No, no, I don't want to swing.
[72:26.14]It's not up.
[72:30.08]It's not left, it's not up.
[72:30.96]Let me try down.
[72:32.62]It's not down.
[72:39.24]It is left.
[72:41.48]What?
[72:42.60]I pressed left so many times.
[72:43.92]What the fuck?
[72:52.24]Okay, ready?
[72:53.92]Left.
[72:55.09]Left.
[72:55.87]What the- what?!
[72:57.63]I did that, like, three times!
[72:59.63]He killed us both.
[73:29.33]Left and then up?
[73:31.37]I don't know.
[73:32.55]He's back to sleep.
[73:35.11]Do I break the glass?
[73:40.29]This is freaking me out.
[73:59.85]Please tell me I can start from there.
[74:01.97]Oh, fuck me.
[74:02.89]I think I have to- I don't know where to go.
[74:20.67]Okay, it's so tall.
[74:21.73]Then, watch out for the thing, the plates that fall.
[74:26.18]And then it's... the over-animated, scary faces.
[74:33.28]Alright, I wonder if it's down.
[74:36.30]I think it's probably down.
[74:37.52]I'm gonna try down.
[74:38.46]Cause, where do I have it?
[74:39.04]Down.
[74:39.54]It's down.
[74:49.89]It's down.
[74:50.37]Okay.
[74:52.51]Left.
[74:55.41]I don't know.
[74:57.29]Right.
[74:57.57]Down.
[74:57.81]I have no idea.
[74:58.45]It's down again.
[74:59.01]Tell me about how to kill the dragon again, please.
[75:23.79]This was video gaming at one point.
[75:25.25]Oh yeah.
[75:25.63]And everybody loved it.
[75:27.59]Right here?
[75:27.97]Okay.
[75:28.17]And then it's left.
[75:53.62]it's not it's down again yep and then I don't know it's either up or right yeah it's but I look these things happen in a tenth of a second
[76:22.92]Look, you know how much money people used to spend on this shit?
[76:27.66]I used to go into arcades back in the fucking early 90s, and the screen would be broken.
[76:32.51]And I would always go up to the machine and be like, I want to try that.
[76:34.77]Why is the monitor, the screen is broken?
[76:41.73]It's because somebody like... I, okay, I got it.
[76:56.40]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[77:01.90]It's down.
[77:02.42]Hey, you guys ready for that monolog again?
[77:11.31]Please save me!
[77:13.09]The key's locked!
[77:14.81]With the key, the dragon keeps it around his neck!
[77:19.37]To slay the dragon, use the magic sword!
[77:23.94]I don't, I still don't have that memorized.
[77:28.38]So it's down twice.
[77:30.66]And then it's right.
[77:32.36]Got it.
[77:37.83]Now what?
[77:42.59]Up.
[77:43.57]No!
[78:02.34]It was too fast.
[78:03.54]I tried to swing.
[78:05.02]I tried to swing too early.
[78:07.21]I just figured, God, whatever.
[78:09.99]Come on.
[78:18.65]Dirt death, Lady Richard.
[78:20.65]Please save me.
[78:22.75]The cage is locked with a key.
[78:25.91]The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[78:29.06]To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[78:35.64]Okay.
[78:36.24]Again.
[78:37.00]That's right.
[78:59.55]I did!
[78:59.97]I did!
[79:00.85]He just dies!
[79:02.17]He just dies!
[79:03.47]There's no... I didn't... He just dies!
[79:05.31]He just dies!
[79:08.24]I have to go left or down or something.
[79:09.60]I have to grab it and jump backwards.
[79:18.86]I think you grab the sword and hit down.
[79:20.32]I'm so close.
[79:24.13]It's down.
[79:25.05]It has to be.
[79:34.38]Why am I looking at chat?
[79:36.92]I'm literally reading chat right now on a game where you have a tenth of a second to press a button.
[79:41.74]What the fuck am I thinking?
[80:02.79]Please save me.
[80:04.61]Stop making me read the chat with your funny copy pasta.
[80:08.63]Please save me.
[80:10.73]The cage is locked with a key.
[80:13.87]The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[80:17.02]To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[80:23.12]I think I'm going to try it down.
[80:26.38]I'm going to grab sword and then press down.
[80:57.06]Should I just not press anything?
[81:01.08]Maybe I just shouldn't press any buttons.
[81:06.80]I don't know.
[81:09.54]If I don't press a button, does it just do it?
[81:13.58]I don't have to swing the sword.
[81:15.26]But do I?
[81:16.06]I have no idea.
[81:25.38]You guys, what the fuck?
[81:53.94]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[81:54.88]I'm not gonna press anything.
[81:58.16]Here we go.
[82:05.49]Don't touch anything.
[82:09.55]I'm dead.
[82:11.41]So all you guys saying I was doing it too early.
[82:19.22]I didn't press any buttons at all.
[82:28.06]So maybe I have to press it right when I touch it?
[82:33.92]Don't go for the sword.
[82:35.05]What?
[82:35.21]Why not?
[82:41.23]I know, I've pressed the sword button, but... You got like this... There's only one window where you can press this button.
[82:49.08]And it's like seven frames, six frames long.
[82:59.65]Maybe even less than that.
[83:07.71]I... I fucking trust it!
[83:24.38]This game is 16 FPS.
[83:25.80]Yeah, so it's even smaller than what you think.
[83:28.72]It's like two, it's one frame per, it's one or two frames.
[83:34.53]I'm going to try to grab, I'm going to try to hit the sword right when I go up to grab the sword.
[83:38.51]Let's see if that does it.
[83:39.73]Like right when my hand touches it.
[83:41.31]The cage is locked with a key.
[83:44.48]The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[83:47.60]To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[83:58.43]Didn't I press it?
[83:58.97]I'm gonna go for it right when I grab the sword.
[84:02.93]Right when I touch it.
[84:05.10]Space.
[84:05.40]I'm like grabbing it.
[84:06.16]I'm like going in space.
[84:07.28]Here we go.
[84:19.10]There's no... No, they can't... There is no inputs.
[84:21.86]There are no inputs.
[84:22.96]I'm doing... That's wrong.
[84:23.97]I'm not going for the sword.
[84:24.61]I'm not gonna grab it.
[84:25.95]There are no inputs.
[84:26.57]You can't do an input there.
[84:29.34]No inputs.
[84:29.84]I just... There's no inputs.
[84:32.20]I'm not going to touch the sword.
[84:44.46]Please save me!
[84:50.92]The cage is locked!
[84:52.64]With a key!
[84:54.09]The dragon keeps it around his neck!
[84:57.03]To slay the dragon, use the magic sword!
[85:01.55]There isn't any way to do this if you grab the sword, otherwise the error sounds in play.
[85:05.11]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[85:06.14]So it's something before you grab the sword?
[85:08.54]Maybe space bright?
[85:10.46]Or like the different input or button press?
[85:12.60]Or another input or button press?
[85:14.38]I just did the same thing twice.
[85:15.93]Holy shit, my brain just went backwards.
[85:18.07]I rewound.
[85:19.29]I'll fall second in my brain.
[85:21.41]Hmm?
[85:31.42]I thought the stream skipped.
[85:33.36]No, it was me.
[85:35.46]So, should I press space right before that transition to get the sword or should I hit like a different right or down or left?
[85:47.94]I don't know.
[85:48.64]He saved me.
[85:50.34]The cage is locked with a key.
[85:53.50]The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[85:57.38]Alright, let's see what happens.
[86:03.84]I'm gonna try to do sword right before I go grab it.
[86:10.90]Here we go.
[86:29.06]I did it!
[86:30.16]Not one!
[86:37.57]I don't know, it's sword twice.
[86:40.13]It's sword, and then sword to block, and then... God, if I know.
[86:52.38]So it's sword right before you touch it, sword again to block, and then I have to move.
[87:08.55]I don't know what to believe.
[87:10.47]I'm gonna try- I'm gonna try up.
[87:41.30]Left, Jeremy.
[87:45.78]You're all saying different shit.
[87:51.43]Okay.
[87:56.53]Left!
[87:58.11]Right!
[87:59.77]No!
[88:01.03]There's more!
[88:12.50]It's left and then... I have no idea.
[88:15.55]Left and then up maybe?
[88:16.65]I did left and then right and it was wrong.
[88:29.75]You spent all your allowance on this ship.
[88:34.67]Yeah, I'm happy I did.
[88:36.17]No guides, by the way.
[88:37.93]I don't need guides.
[88:59.58]Let's do it again.
[89:02.24]This is it.
[89:13.21]Left.
[89:13.51]It's space!
[89:19.73]Oh, I did it!
[89:21.83]What do I do?
[89:23.35]Grab it?
[89:25.61]Up?
[89:27.34]Don't touch anything.
[89:37.38]What?
[89:37.62]Did she just- I said I win.
[89:49.29]That's it.
[89:55.57]That's the end of the game.
[89:57.05]I win.
[90:01.48]Watch the... The next drawing we're going to do has two characters in it, and the two are... I get to draw Dirk.
[90:10.06]...and the dragon, Singe.
[90:12.27]Now, Dirk is a little tiny character, and dragon is a great big character.
[90:16.07]Okay.
[90:16.55]So what I'm going to do to cheat this a little bit is I'll pull Dirk into the foreground so that he stays kind of big and push the dragon into the background.
[90:24.79]And I think just to get this thing to work, I'm going to...
[90:31.01]sketch out how I can do this.
[90:32.55]This dragon is sort of looking at Dirk like that.
[90:39.52]And I can bring all the tail up around like this.
[90:44.92]I have to concentrate while I draw, sorry.
[90:47.41]So I think that's going to work.
[90:56.21]So the dragon
[90:57.61]What I just told you I think is really relevant here.
[90:59.70]What's the dragon doing?
[91:00.92]Is he excited?
[91:01.82]Is he angry?
[91:13.27]That's probably like a 40-minute video.
[91:14.59]I don't want to... Why did I skip that?
[91:17.55]Because that's probably... That's gonna... That's like a 28-minute video.
[91:24.38]I was watching that.
[91:25.78]Well, let's... Go look... Go look up Draw Dick on... Or Draw Dirk on YouTube.
[91:39.08]Alright, that's that one.
[91:41.10]We're just getting started.
[91:45.81]I got Dragon's Lair 2.
[91:48.53]I've also got Space Ace.
[91:50.53]Let's get away from Dragon's Lair.
[91:52.03]Let's try this one.
[91:53.45]Now this one is really old and has not been remastered.
[91:57.76]So it looks like dog shit.
[91:59.26]So we're gonna try this one.
[92:03.76]I hope it opens.
[92:04.62]This doesn't even have a thing on Steam, I don't think.
[92:15.73]I don't know if I'm going to beat this one.
[92:19.23]I really doubt that I'm going to because it's so crunchy.
[92:22.67]It's Kingdom of the Far Reaches.
[92:31.88]This is a crunchy fucking game.
[92:38.38]So let me get this right.
[92:42.57]It should...
[92:46.85]Okay, hopefully this fucking opens.
[92:51.69]Oh god, I can't even fucking see.
[92:54.50]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[92:59.32]No, that's my com- that's a command prompt.
[93:01.24]Come on, I'll get it.
[93:05.09]There it is.
[93:05.49]There it is.
[93:14.98]Oh, yeah!
[93:15.74]It didn't even take me five seconds!
[93:17.06]I got it immediately!
[93:18.48]It was ready to go!
[93:21.24]Let's do it.
[93:29.53]You can still see, right?
[93:30.85]Everyone can see perfectly fine?
[93:35.51]This is a crusty fucking game.
[93:37.55]Just need to be very aware of that.
[93:44.90]Virtual Image Productions presents... The Far Reaches.
[93:51.48]Kingdom of the Far Reaches.
[93:53.54]Start apprentice, start wizard.
[93:56.26]I think this is difficulties.
[93:57.24]I don't know if I want to do start as a wizard.
[94:06.85]Wizard.
[94:15.02]No.
[94:16.38]I ain't doing that.
[94:18.32]The history.
[94:21.32]Is it He-Man?
[94:37.54]The time of the Argent Kings is past.
[94:40.75]You, my old friend, are the last of your race.
[94:43.41]This is fucking crunchy.
[94:44.77]Farewell.
[94:46.61]That's an evil wizard.
[94:50.47]No, Torlark.
[94:52.59]There is one.
[94:54.58]One who will come.
[94:56.64]In time.
[94:58.24]Come to destroy you.
[95:03.82]What was that?
[95:06.56]What was that?
[95:08.26]He, like, burped out his true form for a second.
[95:10.56]Oops.
[95:13.52]So the high race of the Argent Kings passed from the world, destroyed by Torlock the Twisted.
[95:21.07]Before the last battle, the Argent Kings established the Order of the Great Wizards, of whom I am the last.
[95:28.59]The wisest and most powerful was our leader, Mobus.
[95:35.54]That's a huge fucking amulet.
[95:39.92]Grandpa, are you sure you didn't just spray paint a hubcap fucking gold?
[95:46.74]It's a piece of pineapple.
[96:01.74]Volus is gone, but the one who will come remains.
[96:06.07]I am ready.
[96:08.29]Torlock is searching for the relics and for you.
[96:12.06]His power grows while the old magic fades.
[96:17.45]That's... That's... Is that a... That means you're a bad teacher, right?
[96:22.67]You've had 22 apprentices and they've all died.
[96:25.47]I think that that's on you.
[96:27.63]That means you're not doing good enough like magicians teach you.
[96:45.65]Alright, I'm gonna turn it up.
[96:46.35]Somebody said it's not loud enough.
[96:51.31]That should be good.
[96:51.95]Alright, I'm not starting as a wizard.
[96:57.76]Are you guys serious?
[96:59.32]That's not gonna happen.
[97:04.28]I'm doing Apprentice.
[97:04.98]Can you already see this?
[97:15.87]I just did that.
[97:17.05]That was me.
[97:17.63]By the way, this is a DVD game.
[97:23.61]I was actually gonna put this on a TV and play it.
[97:31.95]Galon, what's wrong?
[97:33.71]Lathan, a terrible thing has happened.
[97:38.13]Drake's Blood the Wicked has imprisoned the rightful ruler and claimed the throne.
[97:43.73]You must find the relics, the Black Mace, the Hunting Horn, and the Orb of Mobus to defeat Drake's Blood.
[97:51.55]Hurry to my mansion.
[97:52.89]I am preparing scrolls to help you on your journey.
[97:56.07]The kingdoms are counting on you, Latham.
[97:57.93]This reminds me of like that old Bible animation.
[98:02.40]You are my last hope to find the relics of Volvus and renew the magic that grows old as I do.
[98:10.48]But until you hold the relics, be cautious in your use of magic.
[98:16.18]I understand, Aelin.
[98:20.21]I have finished new scrolls for you.
[98:22.81]I give you three scrolls inscribed with spells of seeing.
[98:27.01]They bring sight to the blind and show those with vision that which is hidden.
[98:32.98]Okay.
[98:34.40]You got me a backpack with three magical scrolls.
[98:37.40]Now, which scrolls should I work on next?
[98:44.16]Which scrolls should you work on?
[98:45.58]Spell of understanding, spell of release, spell of traveling.
[98:52.39]Uh... Spell of release?
[98:59.44]Now choose, where in the kingdom of Wygard do you wish to go?
[99:03.96]The village of Glendow, where once you lived, the Haunted Waterfalls, or the Eldritch Forest?
[99:09.87]I mean, the Haunted Waterfalls is absolutely where I'm going to go first.
[99:13.51]Haunted Waterfalls.
[99:17.19]Now I'm out at Bristol, dark enchantment holds the best.
[99:21.87]So you must use your magic to release the spell of rest.
[99:27.14]I have no idea what the fuck any of these people just said.
[99:30.86]I've- What did you say?
[99:31.69]Uh... Scroll of Seeing.
[99:46.51]Uh, okay.
[99:47.19]I don't... Lathan?
[99:54.42]Tree Folk Forest.
[99:58.91]Let's go to lower pools.
[100:16.10]I have not completed your scrolls yet, Latham.
[100:18.91]Continue your quest and I will have your spells ready soon.
[100:23.19]I didn't think you'd be back this soon.
[100:28.21]I haven't had time.
[100:29.91]I just put it in the oven.
[100:32.47]You're gonna come back in 15 minutes.
[100:35.50]What the fuck do you want me to do now?
[100:38.74]What?
[100:39.14]Where the fuck am I?
[100:40.84]Can I choose a different part of the map?
[100:42.66]Bogs on the moors.
[100:46.24]This guy sucks.
[100:46.96]What?
[101:00.05]Jesus!
[101:00.79]Welcome back, Lathan.
[101:02.19]I have finished new scrolls for you.
[101:04.79]Here are three scrolls inscribed with spells of release.
[101:08.43]This guy can't even walk correctly.
[101:09.45]They disarm traps and separate that which should not be bound together.
[101:15.29]Okay.
[101:18.86]Now, which scrolls should I work on next?
[101:21.46]Which scrolls should you work on next?
[101:23.12]Okay, so I have scrolls of release.
[101:26.56]Didn't those people in the water say release?
[101:31.31]Spell of under... Spell of Traveling!
[101:34.15]Now choose.
[101:35.47]Where in the kingdom of Wygard do you wish to go?
[101:38.25]Let's go to... The village of Glendome, where once you lived?
[101:41.50]The Haunted Waterfalls, or the Eldritch Forest?
[101:45.22]Haunted Waterfalls.
[101:46.10]I have the... I got the Spell of Release.
[101:47.52]Now I'm bound at Briflo.
[101:50.64]Dark enchantment holds it fast.
[101:52.58]Chocolate milk?
[101:53.18]So you must use your magic to release the Spell of Rest.
[101:57.84]Where's my spell?
[102:01.16]Release us?
[102:01.82]That's the one right there!
[102:09.07]How the fuck do I use it?
[102:33.69]Press the help.
[102:36.97]That's not going to help me.
[102:42.23]No, go.
[102:45.64]Didn't they say release us?
[102:51.68]Spell of release.
[102:52.80]So how do I just, like, can I, like, cast it?
[102:55.72]Click it.
[102:56.74]Right click.
[102:57.49]Left click.
[102:57.99]It just closes it.
[103:04.46]Okay, bye.
[103:08.29]Press 3.
[103:08.57]No, I don't want to... Don't go to the lower pools.
[103:20.84]The Treefolk Forest.
[103:26.98]You are the wood elves?
[103:28.00]The people of the forest?
[103:29.60]Yes, and we know of your quest.
[103:31.72]Mobus was our friend, and we offer you the help of the wood elf staff.
[103:36.98]Well, let me get it.
[103:38.58]Wait, is this a trick?
[103:39.42]This is a trick, isn't it?
[103:46.55]Take the staff to the fairy circle in the forest, and give it to the fairies.
[103:54.87]Okay, take it to the- to the fairy circle in the forest.
[104:02.99]Forester's Camp?
[104:08.20]Guildhall?
[104:09.12]Center of Glen- Forester's Ca- This is Forester's Camp?
[104:14.05]Right?
[104:14.71]That's the middle of the forest.
[104:23.95]Go away.
[104:24.85]Strangers aren't welcome.
[104:27.59]Okay.
[104:34.45]I can't click the link.
[104:35.68]I can't alt-tab out of the game, otherwise it'll break.
[104:38.06]Lots of these crossroads.
[104:44.52]Berry Circle!
[104:52.37]I have no strength left.
[105:00.07]What?
[105:00.85]I've heard that kind of singing before.
[105:03.12]The fairies must be here.
[105:05.36]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[105:08.76]Spell the wood elf staff.
[105:10.16]Spell of release.
[105:10.84]Spell of seeing.
[105:13.38]Wood elf staff.
[105:14.38]Seeing first?
[105:23.19]Okay, here's his staff.
[105:25.79]Goodbye?
[105:26.09]Be sure to try our delicious cookies!
[105:52.19]The one with the fudge in the middle is my favorite.
[105:54.09]Crystal Castle, I can just go to it.
[105:56.55]Oh, Spell of Release.
[106:01.35]I'm holding them in my hands.
[106:04.87]I'm holding the spells in my hands.
[106:22.33]Why?
[106:23.73]No, what?!
[106:24.49]Crystal tigers!
[106:30.87]So I'm not actually a wizard.
[106:34.67]Okay, so that just keeps me alive.
[106:36.43]I can't go in the door.
[106:45.37]Um... foresters camp?
[106:48.90]Wait, zoom out.
[107:01.73]Uh... This game's not that big, is it?
[107:12.50]I can't go anywhere else besides, like, the one area that I am?
[107:18.66]Well, then let me go to the tree... Let me go back to the forest's camp.
[107:21.70]This guy just yells at me.
[107:26.61]What?
[107:27.07]You again?
[107:27.89]I told you to go away!
[107:31.01]But what are you gonna do?
[107:34.85]Okay, the center of Glendo.
[107:44.46]Leave Wygard, Nathan.
[107:46.28]The Guild Lords are tools of the Plague Magician, who is Torlock's ally.
[107:50.32]Flee across the Marsh Wastes and into Isles.
[107:53.88]Flee across the Marsh Wastes into...
[108:02.11]Turn on subtitles.
[108:03.11]Do you really think that a game that came out like 32 years ago is gonna have subtitles in the options?
[108:07.78]Uh, Spell of Sea.
[108:27.96]You healed me!
[108:29.06]When the town hears of your powers, the guild lords will have to give you safe passage to the haunted waterfall.
[108:36.66]What?
[108:36.82]It is the law!
[108:39.49]So, the guild... I gotta go to the guild hall.
[108:45.83]It is the law!
[108:48.57]Go to the guild hall?
[108:51.92]How do I get to the guild hall?
[109:00.17]This is an instant death screen.
[109:02.45]Ancient runes.
[109:06.65]I wonder how I can understand them.
[109:08.90]Scroll of seeing.
[109:12.44]What?
[109:12.70]Shit.
[109:28.90]I need a scroll of understanding.
[109:32.09]Let me go back to the magician, then.
[109:33.63]Path.
[109:35.19]Path.
[110:05.43]Alright.
[110:06.45]Skip.
[110:07.63]Skip.
[110:07.91]Skip it.
[110:09.19]I want you to work on Scroll of Understanding.
[110:16.17]It's too crusty.
[110:17.53]Is it too crusty?
[110:18.49]Just wait.
[110:18.77]Alright, I need to go to the forest.
[110:32.98]They give me the staff.
[110:33.80]I have slow understanding.
[110:34.80]The people of the forest?
[110:36.38]Yes, and... Give me that.
[110:40.52]Take the staff.
[110:43.86]Alright, later.
[110:55.56]You're... I don't like you.
[110:57.84]No.

[111:06.53]There it is.
[111:06.99]Let's get the... I don't understand what this does.
[111:10.03]This doesn't kill me.
[111:11.67]I just smell something.
[111:13.33]And it makes me feel better.
[111:14.33]I have no strength left.
[111:16.22]Okay.
[111:18.00]Cool.
[111:18.94]Here's your staff.
[111:29.31]Your health is the tree branch at the top of the... Okay, that could be the worst health bar I've ever seen in my whole life.
[111:40.66]Alright, thank you.
[111:46.30]Okay, bye.
[111:46.66]Quest complete.

[111:49.50]Let's go to the...
[112:01.44]Alright, you went in for the kill this time.
[112:06.28]You didn't kill me last time.
[112:13.37]Good, you have returned.
[112:15.37]The new scrolls are complete.
[112:17.69]These scrolls of understanding give you knowledge of ancient alphabets and unfamiliar terms.
[112:23.24]Use them when you encounter these barriers.

[113:20.54]Go to the guild hall.
[113:27.46]You healed me!
[113:28.60]When the town hears of your powers, the guild lords will have to give you safe passage to the haunted waterfall.
[113:36.23]It is the law!
[113:38.97]Thank you.
[113:40.03]Now we go back up the center of Glendale.
[113:46.68]And then to the guild hall.
[113:52.03]Why would that make you concerned?
[113:53.97]Oh dear, that's not good.
[113:55.25]Guildhall.
[113:55.55]What?
[114:20.02]All the aliens, travel far, overlook no source of air.
[114:26.78]Does anybody have any idea what just happened?
[114:33.76]The Guildhall has even heard about your beautiful efforts and they really like you.
[114:37.61]Okay, go to Guildhall.
[114:40.21]Don't let him in.
[114:42.25]Seize him and send him to the pool of knowledge.
[114:46.35]I don't get it.
[114:47.89]Seize him.
[114:51.26]That's usually something that happens when something bad happens to you afterwards.
[115:01.90]Is this gonna kill me?
[115:07.44]Alright, kids, I'm sorry.
[115:09.29]I got nothing for you.
[115:23.28]I gotta go back down to where that scroll was.
[115:26.40]No, I'm gonna breathe in the fucking, like, fart gas.
[115:28.90]Okay.
[115:29.04]Didn't... What are you talking about?
[115:30.20]I thought I... Center of Glendale.
[115:32.08]I'm going down.
[115:32.66]Okay.
[115:53.03]And then it's outskirts.
[115:56.05]And then it's the scroll of understanding I can do down here.
[116:01.00]Friend, can you help me?
[116:02.46]I... I have heard stories about relic hidden in the forest in the Castle of Crystal.
[116:09.64]I've also heard that fairies guard the path.
[116:12.14]Now go, Lathan.
[116:13.08]This place is not safe for you.
[116:16.54]This what place?
[116:17.74]Why is everybody... Why does everybody hate me?
[116:21.27]Barren rocks.
[116:21.91]Here it is.
[116:26.63]Scroll of Understanding.
[116:28.41]Scroll of Understanding.
[116:30.33]That literally did not even help me at all.
[116:34.29]Not at all.
[117:01.20]Okay, so might as well see what this is.
[117:33.95]I'm gonna be honest.
[117:36.63]If there's that much voltage going through that crystal, that shit's gonna be humming.
[117:43.73]If there's 600,000 volts going through that thing, you'll hear that from fuckin' 50 feet away.
[117:47.33]You ain't gonna touch that.
[117:48.49]Why don't you work on the spell of release?
[118:01.28]Now choose, where in the kingdom of Wygard do you wish to go?
[118:05.40]The village of Glendome, where once you lived, the haunted waterfalls, or the Eldritch Forest?
[118:11.70]The amps kill you, not the vaults.
[118:16.70]I'm sorry, I'm not an electrician.
[118:22.38]I have the spell of release, so why shouldn't I go to the waterfall?
[118:38.80]You must use your magic to release us from our spell of traveling.
[118:51.17]That's a skull.
[118:53.05]Black Keep?
[118:54.29]Sea Dweller's Pavilion?
[118:58.42]The High Ground.
[119:04.22]Just go into the palace.
[119:05.63]Just teleport.
[119:06.59]Wait, does teleport into the boss's room, like, throne room behind him and, like, bash his head with a rock?
[119:27.03]This is Drake's Blood's palace, you know.
[119:29.37]And his wizards won't like your coming here.
[119:31.95]They get very jealous.
[119:34.19]How do you know I'm a wizard?
[119:36.07]Ha!
[119:36.91]Who else travels in these hard times?
[119:42.27]What?
[119:42.79]What do you mean, who else travels?
[119:54.58]Who do you harp for?
[119:55.72]Yourself?
[119:56.92]I played for Grace Delight, the true ruler of Iskar, until Drake's blood imprisoned her in the North Tower and claimed the throne.
[120:04.58]He was corrupted by Torlok, as are many here.
[120:09.59]I couldn't hear a word he said.
[120:18.79]Doorway, door, which doorway?
[120:20.81]I'm gonna go up and through this door.
[120:27.22]Look at that posture.
[120:28.42]Pog.
[120:28.80]I found it!
[120:30.14]I found the... Why are they letting me just walk around the castle?
[120:33.03]Where are the guards?
[120:33.95]We're just eating dinner.
[120:58.02]Another joker there.
[121:00.22]Looks like it's been a while since good was done around here.
[121:03.04]Oh, I bet you come like the others to slay the king.
[121:09.52]Rock!
[121:10.93]Um... So... Everyone is mocking me because I'm here to kill the king.
[121:22.07]Right.
[121:22.29]So why am I not... Why am I allowed just to walk around?
[121:25.72]Okay, what about this doorway?
[121:28.86]I can't do anything else here.
[121:29.76]Door, we'll go up here.
[121:33.43]Hello, um, I, uh, well, I... You're another wizard looking for the relic.
[121:37.99]Well, you may find a way to Alcatraz if you can make the tapestry of being in the south.
[121:43.87]Get out of here.
[121:48.53]Oh, hello, I, um, well, I don't know.
[121:50.96]Look, the wizard's back.
[121:53.78]Who are the others you mentioned before?
[121:56.17]Apprentices of daylight, they live in the palace now.
[122:06.72]Oh no, I went into the time room!
[122:10.64]You just have this unguarded?
[122:15.43]This is just an open doorway into like a fucking portal.
[122:19.07]Um, I don't know.
[122:30.41]Wait, why am I here?
[122:32.57]Where's the wizard?
[122:33.44]He's dead!
[122:33.76]He died!
[122:34.54]That was his force ghost.
[122:35.90]Uh, I-
[122:57.57]Should I keep going?
[123:05.80]Oh fuck!
[123:06.46]Oh fuck!
[123:07.08]Oh fuck!
[123:08.50]Out!
[123:10.72]Get on the high ground!
[123:19.42]Lathan, be cautious.
[123:21.28]Bandits who will steal everything you carry roam the rocky desert.
[123:26.74]Leave me the fuck alone.
[123:28.88]Shimmering Oasis.
[123:36.60]Dunes People Campsite.
[123:38.96]Temple of Syndra.
[123:43.17]Where am I going?
[123:48.51]Shimmering Oasis.
[123:49.29]That's gonna be healing, I think.
[123:50.43]Hmm.
[123:59.70]Pool, what do you mean pool?
[124:01.22]There's no pool here.
[124:02.62]There's no, there's no, there's no pool.
[124:09.64]That's not a pool.
[124:15.00]This is a mirage.
[124:20.16]That's sand.
[124:23.31]Drink from the sand.
[124:24.93]That'll, I'm gonna die.
[124:36.92]What?
[124:37.20]Why?
[124:37.34]Who's... Who's... Electrify... That's confusing.
[125:07.99]Uh... One more.
[125:09.47]This is the third attempt.
[125:11.83]Last try.
[125:12.61]This time... Last try.
[125:13.69]This is it.
[125:16.21]This time I'm going to start with the scroll of traveling because that's the best one.
[125:19.50]Let's go to...
[125:37.67]I just want to see.
[125:39.79]I got instantly eaten by rats.
[125:41.15]Oh, come on.
[125:42.09]Please.
[125:42.41]I just want the scroll.
[126:10.04]Let's go to the Marsh Wastes.
[126:12.48]Wait, is this an instant kill screen?
[126:16.45]The Marsh Wastes.
[126:17.45]What a dreary place.
[126:18.97]I can hardly see where to step.
[126:21.25]Yeah, this is a good- this is a- Spell of Seam.
[126:32.38]Uh-oh.
[126:34.08]Little ills.
[126:35.28]Kills.
[126:35.74]Lies.
[126:36.28]Lies?
[126:38.92]Wise.
[126:50.88]Nothing I can do on this screen.
[126:54.01]Okay, we're back at the Shimmering Oasis.
[126:56.03]Don't touch that.
[127:01.05]How about the Dunes People Campsite?
[127:06.46]Do you know anything about magic?
[127:08.20]About the relics?
[127:09.50]Our legends say that the relics of Mobus can free the kingdoms from the shadow of evil.
[127:15.18]But that is an ancient story.
[127:18.90]Okay, well, thanks, I guess.
[127:24.95]I don't know.
[127:27.61]Lost Mines.
[127:28.55]Mountain Cliffs.
[127:30.63]That's a... Well, that's a fall down and die screen.
[127:33.03]Let's go to the Lost Mines.
[127:40.62]I advise you to seek out the Amazons of the Oasis.
[127:44.62]They will help if you can prove yourself worthy.
[127:48.29]Why, thank you.
[127:49.77]Wait.
[127:49.99]Is that a different guy?
[127:56.61]Was that a different Force ghost?
[127:59.75]How many Force ghost Obi-Wans do I know?
[128:07.80]Uh...
[128:16.14]There's an explosion sound too.
[128:27.26]I knew it, I- Lathan, be cautious.
[128:34.46]Bandits who will steal everything you carry roam the rocky desert.
[128:43.37]Desert Oasis.
[128:45.45]Okay.
[128:47.25]What do you mean, farewell?
[128:50.03]Perhaps you're the one that the legend speaks of.
[128:52.81]Bye.
[128:52.93]Get out of here.
[128:53.61]Leave.
[129:15.56]Alright, well we have to go into the temple then.
[129:17.85]Temple of Syndra.
[129:28.48]That's a huge tower.
[129:35.72]Let's go.
[129:38.82]Stranger, not all of us are under Torlock's influence.
[129:42.91]Look hard.
[129:44.09]There is knowledge hidden here.
[129:50.79]Alright.
[129:51.99]Okay.
[129:52.61]Bill Clinton.
[129:53.67]I'm going to go... This doorway looks scary.
[129:58.15]This one looks safe.
[129:58.91]You have to go to the one that looks scary.
[130:09.69]For the blood sword of the Argentines, look in the black key.
[130:13.87]Look in the black key for the sword.
[130:19.65]I just came over the intercom.
[130:22.57]I'm at an airport or something.
[130:33.24]No, what are you doing?
[130:34.18]Go in here.
[130:37.06]Strange, eh?
[130:45.15]I feel like we missed a whole lot before that happened.
[130:59.17]To me, that seems like we should have gotten at least to the middle point there, where I was sacrificed to a giant demon.
[131:08.14]Wizard mode.
[131:08.86]Alright, the wizard mode!
[131:19.27]Leave Wygard, Lathan.
[131:21.07]The Guild Lords are tools of the Plague Magician, who is Torlock's ally.
[131:25.08]Flee across the Marsh Wastes and into Isles.
[131:27.54]So I don't start with any spells.
[131:31.46]I can't, I don't have my crutch.
[131:40.32]Uh, wait, does this mean that I'm already... I already am, like, I'm... Wizard Mode is the same game, but... Never mind.
[132:10.43]Uh, I'm going to go down to the barren rocks.
[132:15.81]If you don't complete this game, I'm going to leave.
[132:18.31]I don't know what you want me to tell you, but...
[132:36.25]You are my last hope to find the relics of Volvus and renew the magic that grows old as I do.
[132:44.34]But until you hold the relics, be cautious in your use of magic.
[132:50.02]I understand, Daelon.
[132:53.58]So, here's my question.
[132:55.32]The 22 wizards?
[132:56.56]I think it's just me over and over again.
[132:58.16]I figured it out.
[132:58.58]Alright, I want the scroll of traveling.
[133:00.28]I want to go to the haunted waterfalls.
[133:21.12]You must use your magic to release the spell of rest.
[133:25.97]Right?
[133:26.47]Something in my eye.
[133:49.57]Here they go.
[133:50.61]Here's the staff.
[133:52.19]Wood elf staff.
[133:53.67]Just give it back.
[133:54.97]Okay.
[133:55.55]Can I go up there?
[134:11.20]No.
[134:11.74]Fairy circle.
[134:12.72]I don't want to do that again.
[134:14.04]I've already done that.
[134:15.36]Just give me my scroll of teleportation.
[134:17.48]Please.
[134:21.17]You healed me!
[134:27.70]When the town hears of your powers, the guild lords will have to give you safe passage to the haunted waterfalls.
[134:43.51]It is the law!
[134:47.46]Safe passage to the waterfall.
[134:49.04]Okay.
[134:50.38]That brings us up here.
[134:51.76]We're just going to go in order.
[134:53.56]Go back to the healing pools.
[134:56.10]Healers belong at the waterfall.
[135:04.03]But I'm guard.
[135:05.05]Take him.
[135:08.97]You stand healed of all the aliens.
[135:12.89]Travel far.
[135:14.85]Overlook no source of hell.
[135:17.89]Thank you for not being electrified.
[135:19.89]Okay, I'm good to go.
[135:21.43]Now we're going to go from here to the upper pools and then... No, this is the stupid singing ghost thing.
[135:29.94]This is like The Legend of Zelda CD-I.
[135:41.70]Alright, I want to go back to the... I just wasted a heal.
[135:47.12]Yeah, I did.
[135:49.18]Can you tell me anything more?
[135:50.34]Apprentice, the plague magician knows of your quest and... I know he does.
[136:00.16]I need to go get my spell of travel.
[136:05.30]Go away.
[136:06.22]Strangers aren't welcome.
[136:08.55]Wasn't this the guy that just told me come anytime and he'll tell me a story?
[136:12.69]My son was your age when he learned that the cold fire which burns on the marsh waste can destroy the mist monsters.
[136:23.10]Thanks, lady.
[136:27.16]Okay.
[136:34.84]Hello again.
[136:36.08]Norton!
[136:37.38]I once held the second relic, the hunting horn, for many a year after Mobus was gone.
[136:43.35]Now Skylar, the keeper of the clouds, holds it.
[136:46.49]That's all my story, lad.
[136:48.37]Good day.
[136:49.09]Thanks for the story.
[136:53.49]That's the whole story.
[136:56.34]I'm gonna go to the rocks.
[137:00.04]No, fuck.
[137:00.94]No, it's alright.
[137:01.52]I wanna go here.
[137:03.40]Kill me again, marshmallow people.
[137:05.54]I want the squirrel to travel.
[137:10.74]Give me the scroll of travel, I want to go to the one place I haven't gone, and then I'm gonna fucking delete this game from my inventory.
[137:18.86]Good, you have returned.
[137:20.92]The new scrolls are complete.
[137:23.14]These scrolls contain traveling spells.
[137:26.44]This is a 20-hour game.
[137:30.44]How on Earth?
[137:31.72]Now choose, where in the kingdom of life... Alright, it doesn't matter where I go.
[137:36.52]Let's just go to the waterfall and I'm teleporting to it.
[137:39.96]Here we go.
[137:41.74]I want to go to... So that's the palace.
[137:45.30]I want to go to the Sea Dwellers Pavilion.
[137:48.05]That's the only place I haven't gone in the whole world.
[137:51.61]Wait, I haven't gone to Dalen's Mansion.
[137:56.33]Dalen's Mansion.
[138:03.97]Oh fuck, that's the magician's house.
[138:05.67]I have not completed your scrolls yet, Lathan.
[138:09.27]Continue your quest, and I will have your spells ready soon.
[138:13.77]Shit.
[138:14.65]Oh no, god, come on.
[138:17.91]I thought it was a da- I don't know if the guy's name is Dalen.
[138:20.22]He never even introduced himself.

[140:54.88]Where the hell am I?
[140:58.74]This is, okay, this is East Coast Sea.

[142:00.04]50,000 amps going through it.
[142:14.03]And you explode.

[147:15.36]Cadet?
[147:16.36]What's the... You definitely want move guide.
[147:27.20]I'm doing Kidnapped.
[147:32.58]How hard is this one compared to Dragon's Lair?
[147:35.98]What about Captain?
[147:38.26]I'll try Captain.
[147:38.94]I'll try it.
[147:42.60]Cabinet is spelled wrong.
[147:44.26]Cabient.
[147:48.32]I'm going to give it a go.
[147:50.53]Let's go.
[147:53.27]Why is the genie evil?
[147:55.89]That was the genie from Aladdin!
[148:02.65]Oh no it's not, it's just...
[148:23.42]Right twice.
[148:30.37]Energize?
[148:30.99]Huh?
[148:40.38]Oh god.
[148:43.08]Go!
[148:45.16]How the fuck did I do that?
[148:47.80]I did it.
[148:48.08]I did it.
[148:48.94]How did I do that?
[148:57.34]Guys, I'm fucking locked in.
[149:00.37]Up.
[149:01.11]No, it's... Okay, is it down?
[149:06.39]Maybe it's down.
[149:38.94]Dude, it's too much.
[149:44.58]Huh?
[150:02.03]Put on the guide.
[150:02.93]I got through that pretty quickly without the guide.
[150:15.50]Left.
[150:17.76]Right.
[150:22.19]Energize.
[150:31.43]Is it the same actor that played... Who's the antagonist from Dexter's Lab?
[150:36.29]I...
[150:48.55]What the fuck is happening?
[150:49.69]Uh, it's up.
[150:51.25]It's up twice.
[150:53.23]Then it's left.
[150:55.47]And then... left.
[150:56.59]Alright.
[151:21.83]Oh wow, I've been hit.
[151:25.27]What the fuck is happening?
[151:27.58]I don't even... I gotta turn on the guides, I think, man.
[151:29.84]This is like too ridiculous.
[151:31.18]I'll try this one more time.
[151:35.50]You get chatified.
[151:50.51]Energize.
[151:51.92]So don't move to... What?
[151:54.44]What the fuck?
[151:57.50]I thought it was Energize.
[152:15.24]So that energize in the but am I not I'm putting on the guide.
[152:21.97]I don't care It's going on it's going on get it on
[152:42.85]I can't even do it yet.
[152:43.71]What am I supposed to do during the Energize sequence, though?
[152:54.74]Does he stand here?
[152:56.52]See, right?
[152:57.61]I have no idea.
[152:58.79]Alright, no.
[153:03.77]Then... Right!
[153:05.91]And...
[153:07.71]Up!
[153:08.29]And... Hey!
[153:10.55]Oh, I could care less about... I'm putting... There's too many in a row.
[153:28.44]I'm putting the guide on.
[153:29.38]I'll do it on hard, but I'm putting... I ain't doing this one without the guide, I'm telling you.
[153:38.63]I'll put it on ace.
[153:44.87]No fucking way.
[153:46.66]Don't worry, I'll still fuck it up.
[154:05.41]Holy shit, new path.
[154:08.10]This didn't happen before.
[154:17.72]It's too fast, man.
[154:19.87]It's too quick.
[154:22.19]I don't even have time to react to the scenes.
[154:26.29]No, this would have never been done.
[154:33.29]Without the guide.
[154:39.24]Oh, fuck.
[154:43.20]Hard mode is so fast it skips cutscenes and dialog.
[154:47.88]Does it?
[154:48.27]Should I put it back on what it was before?
[154:57.63]Yes, I should.
[155:06.86]Put it on cadet.
[155:09.15]So you can see all the... Alright, we'll do Cadet.
[155:11.65]We're gonna enjoy the game.
[155:17.75]Cadet is just... Cadet with move... Cadet no move guide.
[155:23.10]I don't know if I can do it.
[155:34.90]I don't think I can do it.
[155:36.90]I can't do it.
[155:40.32]Sometimes you have to admit when you're capable of doing something.
[155:57.99]It's still, it doesn't matter, I can still fuck it up.
[156:00.05]And I still will over and over again.
[156:08.03]It's this music is getting in my brain.
[156:23.88]It's the song.
[156:29.74]Let's go.
[156:33.10]What?
[156:33.90]I didn't get a guide.
[156:35.86]I didn't get a guide for that one.
[156:46.89]Okay, remember this part?
[156:47.79]This part sucked.
[156:51.55]Sherma's demoralized?
[156:52.81]It's too loud now.
[156:53.81]I have to turn it down.
[156:55.71]Hold on, I gotta turn it back down.
[156:58.64]It was way too loud.
[157:17.98]That voice doesn't even match.
[157:19.38]Alright, here we go.
[157:20.82]Left.
[157:20.92]Shoot.
[157:46.43]I hate this music so much.
[157:48.13]Alright, was it that?
[157:50.17]Okay, the- Ah!
[158:16.45]Alright, I finally made it past this part.

[161:31.11]All of my fucking molecules.
[161:39.29]You wear your dark side.
[161:48.26]I'm leaning back in my chair and I'm doing some more hard blinking.

[162:53.07]Okay, let's try it again.
[162:59.02]I thought the cadet mode was supposed to slow this shit down, not speed it up.
[163:04.28]Is it blood coming out of my nose?
[163:08.92]No, I'm alright.
[163:10.91]It's Space Ace, but every time they say the word Kimmy, it times ten speed.
[163:23.92]He didn't even eat me.
[163:27.64]He just ate like a bunch of Cheetos.
[163:29.98]He didn't even eat me.
[163:36.82]Oh, come on.
[163:37.40]I did it.
[163:53.86]When I was a little kid, I may have thrown up playing this game.
[164:05.30]I would have gotten to a point where I just... I made it.
[164:14.19]Okay, I made it through that one.
[164:16.33]We're good.
[164:22.82]What?
[164:23.10]There's nobody screaming in my face!
[164:56.35]That is actually painful, you're right.
[164:58.05]It's actually kind of painful to watch.
[164:59.86]I can't imagine how it looks on your screen.
[165:02.26]Because it looks like this on my screen.
[165:04.68]I imagine what it looks like on yours.
[165:06.08]I did it!
[165:08.48]I swear to god.
[165:21.33]It's colored.
[165:23.09]I'll get it.
[165:23.50]I'll get through it.
[165:26.30]Let's go!
[165:56.10]It's such a small window.
[165:59.38]I need to hold on.
[166:04.01]I need a break.
[166:06.35]I need to take a break.
[166:14.27]I need a break.
[166:19.68]I need a prank, this actually is like erring my head.
[166:21.68]I need a fucking prank.
[166:24.99]Hold on.
[166:25.51]No pranks!
[166:26.85]Huh?
[166:59.13]Alright, just everybody relax for a minute.
[167:01.07]We need to take a second.
[167:01.99]Just everybody calm the fuck down.
[167:04.13]Okay?
[167:05.65]Just take a second.
[167:06.41]We're going to just relax.
[167:08.99]Imagine doing this shit without the guy.
[167:10.97]I want you all to just think about that.
[167:12.83]This is never going to happen.
[167:15.67]That would never happen.
[167:18.01]I would fail the first sequence over a hundred times.
[167:30.80]no guide with ace difficulty like that would be a really interesting run to watch alright I I think I'm alright I've just I've taken a moment
[167:56.14]I... I'm ready to continue.
[167:59.12]Here we go.
[167:59.94]Let's try it again.
[168:03.95]Alright, that's what we're looking for here.
[168:05.83]This is all one sequence.
[168:07.21]Remember that one.
[168:08.61]Whoa!
[168:34.38]I missed it again!
[168:35.12]Oh my fucking god!
[169:01.51]I tried to hold it in, I couldn't.
[169:04.61]Dexter, you're late.
[169:08.22]Call me Ace, huh?
[169:10.46]Thanks, I'll walk.

[169:16.08]Call me Ace, huh?
[169:18.23]Where's the ray located?
[169:20.19]In the center of the complex.
[169:22.21]Can you get us in there?
[169:23.09]Yes.
[169:28.06]This is fucking ridiculous.
[169:31.10]I feel like this is what happens.
[169:35.86]No.
[169:36.62]Nevermind.
[169:54.03]I keep seeing that in my head with my eyes open.
[169:57.51]That's bad, right?
[169:58.89]I think so.
[169:59.49]Dexter, you're late.

[170:13.73]Where's the ray located?
[170:15.34]In the center of the complex.

[170:19.21]No, I saw it again.
[170:20.01]No, I'm gonna see it again in 10 seconds.
[170:48.83]No, no, I don't wanna see it again.
[170:52.07]I'm gonna see it again.
[170:57.47]I don't wanna see it!

[173:23.16]No, it's like the dots on the screen.
[173:29.63]When... Why did we think that was so funny?
[173:34.47]Why was that so funny?
[173:35.55]Were we dead?
[173:39.73]That's funny to you guys?

[174:30.70]God damn it!
[174:35.44]It was up, not down.
[174:59.58]It's just a button, but that button, if it's not pressed within a tenth of a second, it's over.
[175:18.86]And you've got colors all over the screen.
[175:21.02]Screaming and dodging and lightning everywhere.
[175:33.52]What?
[175:34.08]Huh?
[176:06.87]I got it.
[176:08.77]I got it.
[176:35.60]You should imagine this shit on an iron difficulty!
[177:02.56]Throw it on your face, Cam.
[177:04.88]Sure.
[177:05.64]I don't care anymore.
[177:08.60]Fine.
[177:08.92]If I don't do it this time.
[177:13.53]It's the cartoon?
[177:14.27]My head!
[177:35.26]Ha ha ha ha!
[177:36.06]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[178:06.72]Oh, I broke my computer.
[178:12.51]Oh, great.
[178:13.21]I got to re-plug this in.
[178:14.49]Shit.
[178:16.73]I'm good.
[178:18.75]Hey, guys.
[178:19.15]I just want to see the cam.
[178:22.20]Turn cam on, man.
[178:23.46]Hold on.
[178:27.60]What would my Joker laugh be?
[178:30.74]Honestly, I'll do a pretty good one in a second.
[178:32.29]Hold on.
[178:40.28]I'll do a good one.
[178:46.32]There's a couple ways to do the Joker.
[178:49.42]There's high-pitched.
[178:50.84]Well, there's the original Joker, which is sort of like with your mouth open really wide.
[179:00.55]And then there's, into the cartoon, the animated Joker, which was more of like a, almost like a witch, I would say.
[179:09.95]Something along the lines of high-pitched and really, really big, big smile.
[179:15.40]Like... That's in the original animated Batman series.
[179:22.14]And then from there, we went to, obviously... He's stalling.
[179:29.70]Oh, for the love of God.
[179:31.30]Fine, here's my Joker laugh.
[179:34.34]I've been working on this.
[179:35.13]I almost just knocked over a fucking glass.
[179:39.63]Stalling.
[179:44.31]Am I even logged in?
[179:49.30]You can't even see it.
[179:50.24]Yeah, I am stalling.
[179:51.16]You're right.
[179:51.56]And you know why?
[179:52.14]Because I only see her colors right now.
[180:04.21]Get this fucking down here.
[180:23.44]How do I fucking do this?
[180:24.72]I forget how to put the webcam on.
[180:30.82]I swear to God.
[180:31.68]There we go.
[180:32.04]Okay.
[180:37.27]Who the fuck's supposed to be sitting there?
[180:39.03]Monk at ass!
[180:39.55]I already- I set it for you so you don't have to.
[180:51.74]Is that good?
[180:53.32]Alright, that's fine.
[180:54.96]Like, this shit even matters.
[180:55.86]Let's just put it over the... Okay, here we go.
[181:00.66]Oh, there's no controller, right.
[181:01.64]Okay.
[181:27.06]What the fuck was that sound?
[181:59.48]We didn't get the Joker laugh?
[182:00.62]Oh, sorry, I forgot.
[182:01.56]Ah, I forgot.
[182:04.59]Ah, I forgot.
[182:05.49]That wasn't it.
[182:05.97]That was me saying, ah, ah, I forgot.
[182:11.81]There's a fake webcam?
[182:16.78]I should just delay the webcam for five minutes.
[182:20.84]I feel like it matters.
[182:27.95]See, the webcam actually makes this harder for me, because not only am I aware of the stuff on screen, I'm aware of you looking at my face.
[182:33.91]Guys, I treat face cam the same way I treat somebody watching me eat a sandwich.
[182:42.04]Like, I know you're looking at my face right now, and it's like, I don't want you to look at my face!
[183:17.49]Alright, I gotta fucking... I have to do this.
[183:20.93]I don't care.
[183:21.49]Let's go.
[183:22.57]I'm so close.
[183:25.09]My keyboard is fucked up.
[183:30.63]It's like... Did you hear that?
[183:32.75]Did you hear the space bar get hit?
[183:34.05]And it didn't happen?
[183:34.79]You heard it.
[183:35.27]I know you did.
[183:39.69]I've lost my mind.
[183:40.36]I can't do it.
[183:42.82]I'm about 10 milliseconds behind.
[183:45.16]There's been too many fucking QTEs today.
[184:12.24]Dexter!
[184:12.50]Dexter, the Enfant Array is... Take that.
[184:16.51]Dexter!
[184:17.97]Run!
[184:18.29]Run!
[184:18.75]Take that.
[184:39.47]Oh, Dexter!
[184:40.73]Isn't he adorable?
[184:44.13]Can we keep him?
[184:45.75]Call me in his house, Smurf.
[185:11.08]I won.
[185:11.44]I just beat it.
[185:32.99]Oh crap.
[185:35.85]So that was a lot more intense and a lot shorter than Dragon Age.
[185:42.24]No, not Dragon Age.
[185:42.99]Dragon's Lair.
[185:48.35]Aha!
[185:49.26]Borf is here!
[185:58.22]Okay, remember, I was about to say something.
[186:00.08]So, you know when you look at the dots, the little splotches on the screen?
[186:06.24]It's like, stare at the center of this image for 25 seconds.
[186:10.10]And then, boom!
[186:12.22]Start blinking because it's on a white background.
[186:13.90]And you're like, oh, there's Jesus, right?
[186:16.90]Whatever it is.
[186:21.37]That's what I'm doing.
[186:21.93]That's what happened.
[186:22.41]That's what's happening right now.
[186:23.29]Okay, so we got Dragons Layer 2.
[186:26.47]I don't know if this one, should I do this one?
[186:40.07]Okay.
[186:52.45]Dragon's Lair 2 Time Warp.
[186:59.02]I gotta change the name of the game.
[187:06.22]I feel like I just woke up.
[187:07.80]You know when you stay up all night?
[187:11.14]and the sun starts to come up and you you kind of start to see that you leave your room and there's a window and you start to see the sun come up and it's like that's how I feel right now alright hold on dragon's lair two okay look at the okay I want you to refresh the screen when uh I'll tell you when
[187:42.00]So, there's no Dragon's Lair 2, but there is a Dawn Bluth Presents Dragon Lair 20th Anniversary Special Edition.
[187:50.68]I think it has a 2 in it.
[187:52.44]It does have a 2.
[187:57.56]I guess.
[188:00.34]Okay.
[188:02.12]So, let's get to it.
[188:03.70]Do you want to see any extras?
[188:14.79]Should I just watch the game?
[188:15.69]No.
[188:15.91]Okay.
[188:17.75]This is the animated FMV night.
[188:19.27]I gotta go for it.
[188:22.73]Director's Cut or the original?
[188:24.41]Five lives always.
[188:25.43]Move beats.
[188:26.27]We'll take... Should I do the move guide on this one?
[188:28.19]Is this one horrible?
[188:30.03]There's no, uh, difficulty on this one.
[188:36.94]Yes.
[188:37.54]This is so hard.
[188:39.26]This one is so hard.

[189:50.75]Why am I... What's the context here?
[189:53.31]What the fuck is happening?
[189:54.55]Am I getting thrown out?
[189:55.48]Kidnapped again.
[190:00.12]I'm being blamed.
[190:18.97]We're in the dungeon!
[190:19.77]Leave me alone!
[190:28.10]Why are you still fighting me in here?
[190:29.76]You could help me!
[190:30.40]You could be like the player two!
[190:41.27]Oh my god.
[190:42.58]Why is our Star Wars cannon here?
[190:45.10]Give me the cape.
[190:46.80]Who is talking?
[190:47.30]Um... Why are you still here?
[191:13.38]Okay, thank god I got a checkpoint.
[191:14.82]It's just like... You're gonna start all the way at the beginning.
[191:53.66]Oh, this is not good.
[192:05.65]Holy shit.
[192:07.37]This is in the arcade?
[192:08.59]They probably saw the first one and they were just like, you know what, fuck it.
[192:16.54]This shit would cost thousands of dollars to be in the arcade.
[192:21.50]Hopefully you had like a credit card.
[192:23.76]You need to have two assistants carry the coins to help you do this.
[192:52.25]You must be Dirt, Dirt the Dairy.
[192:54.51]Fetch me a drink.
[192:57.16]Daphne's lost in the halls of time.
[192:59.10]A prisoner she's under her spell.
[193:03.71]Hasten, lad, hurry.

[194:56.47]So, dear brother, you bring Dirk here, you collagenous, clanking piece of junk?

[195:25.50]I can't talk.
[195:26.80]I can't.
[195:27.20]I can't talk to you.
[195:29.24]I need to just stare at this.
[195:33.74]Why is there a Doug soundtrack?
[195:39.14]Every time there was a transition in Doug, it would do that, like...
[195:45.36]Is that happening or am I making that up?
[196:13.62]Uh, I hope- I guess the, uh... How's the movie?
[196:21.19]Because I can't see it.

[201:36.82]Give me a checkpoint or something.
[201:38.16]Give me a checkpoint.
[201:40.06]It's alright.
[201:40.87]I'm here.
[201:48.53]Yes, good Wait, this is
[202:14.38]This is fair- Wait, this is not- This is- Alice in Wonderland?
[202:25.48]Stop shooting me with the fucking-
[202:29.65]Alright, let's go.
[202:30.63]I thought I was going to be swinging again.
[202:56.94]He looks like he's in pain, is what somebody said earlier.
[202:59.16]No, I'm not in pain.
[203:02.12]I am in total focused in, locked in mode.
[203:06.71]It may look like pain, but it's not.
[203:11.25]Get in there.
[203:27.55]Swing.
[203:28.63]Kill.
[203:35.50]I mean, it's beautifully animated, I will say.
[203:39.54]No, don't start at the fucking painting.
[203:46.13]Don't start at the painting.
[203:47.27]All the way back at the damn painting.
[204:03.85]How would you do this without a guide?
[204:05.99]You just have to be really good at catching every flash.
[204:09.03]You notice how the screen flashes?
[204:10.95]You just have to be ready like, flash flash!
[204:14.71]And that might... I'm not even sure that happens if you turn the guide off.
[204:21.36]My fingers hurt.
[204:23.44]That's how you can tell you're getting old.
[204:31.69]After, like, sitting here and pressing the same keys... The insides of my fingers are liquidating right now.
[204:40.41]They're being liquidated.
[204:45.57]Whoa!
[204:45.93]I thought it was up.
[205:13.00]Come on.
[205:19.40]I did it.
[205:19.68]I'm back outside.
[205:20.54]Good.
[205:20.96]I went down a new area.
[205:23.18]Nimbusland.
[205:23.78]It's blink time.
[205:31.34]New area.
[205:31.82]Time to blink.
[205:35.42]Again, I'm just like laughing at
[205:50.43]Stop right there.
[205:53.49]One more step and you're finished.
[206:03.71]What the fuck is happening?
[206:10.41]Go away.
[206:11.47]No visitors.
[206:13.87]Back.
[206:18.20]Yum-yum.
[206:18.78]Yum-yum?

[207:17.77]There's so much going on in every scene.
[207:20.95]You could dissect every single one of these scenes.
[207:25.45]Hang on, brother.
[207:26.42]Don't eat him.
[207:28.10]Dirk here's our ticket to fame and fortune.
[207:31.96]Look here.
[207:32.74]I'll get you the princess when you bring Eve to me.
[207:36.36]Who's talking?
[207:37.18]Eve.

[207:39.80]Hot.
[207:47.39]Eat the apple.
[207:48.73]She's going to eat the apple.
[207:53.57]Oh, no.
[207:56.65]Oh, dear.
[207:58.61]Oh, dear.
[207:59.79]Oh, my god.
[208:00.87]What?
[208:01.19]That's because she ate the.
[208:06.20]Oh, beginning note.
[208:06.90]Go away.
[208:09.30]No visitors.
[208:11.70]Back.
[208:14.62]Adam and Eve.
[208:15.86]Oh.
[208:19.14]You know what's ridiculous about video games and gaming in general?
[208:28.97]Let's talk, let's go over this.
[208:30.79]So this is, this was like QTE's, oh wow, it's QTE's cutscenes, but react fast.
[208:38.77]We went from this to being able to fail three to four or five of these in a fucking row and have nothing happen to you.
[208:47.70]When did that happen?
[208:48.46]We went from one extreme to the next.
[208:49.94]In fact, in a lot of cases, failing QTEs in-game doesn't do anything.
[209:07.83]It's just, they added an animation.
[209:09.37]Alright, I gotta focus here.
[209:12.77]I don't wanna do this again.
[209:27.89]What?
[209:28.87]I'm on a guy's piano now.
[209:35.05]Is that the Mad Hatter?
[209:38.22]Why does everybody want to eat you?
[209:50.59]That's something else too!
[209:53.01]What was with every single fucking character wants to eat you in all these games from 20 years ago?
[210:05.57]Everybody wanted to just swallow you.
[210:08.52]Cats, birds, people, monsters, didn't matter.
[210:15.28]You were dinner for somebody in every single one of these games.
[210:25.65]Ooh, I must press left.
[210:26.63]Why is he up here with the piano?
[210:30.91]What did he just do?
[210:33.07]Did he just flash the camera?
[210:34.89]I didn't even see it.
[210:56.83]I hope not.
[211:26.91]Alright, we're good.
[211:28.55]I have to pee so bad again.
[211:35.87]Okay, let me ask you a question.
[211:42.30]When you have to pee, I really do feel like this sometimes.
[211:45.66]I'm like processing all the fucking negative energy in my body right now and I'm going to pee it out.
[211:51.06]I really feel that way sometimes.
[212:12.75]do some reddit reddit analysis on my urine yeah okay I can't look over here because that's where you guys are and you guys are a distraction
[212:37.73]That was an embarrassing face, I think.
[212:42.77]Remember, Jeremy, everything you do into that camera is... is there forever.
[212:54.55]God damn it.
[212:58.87]If you type in, like, Jerma into Google...
[213:04.05]Jerma985.
[213:05.45]I think it's still there.
[213:06.23]There's an image of my face that is one of the... It's like the top thing that is always shown.
[213:11.90]Is the one where I'm going like...
[213:55.16]What's this mean?
[213:58.02]What's that mean?
[214:05.49]When did it freeze?
[214:06.21]Are we good?
[214:16.84]I missed every single treasure?
[214:18.46]How is that possible?
[214:21.72]It froze on that face?
[214:26.02]we didn't wait what was the last thing I said I said that's the most searched face okay then I went on to say that that's the most searched face that's like the face that I think I'm going down again no something's going on here now that's the most searched face and the thing is I had like I have to when my my mother sees that image
[214:57.93]Oh yeah, Jerma985.
[215:00.03]Top 500 streamer.
[215:01.11]Top 50 streamer.
[215:05.38]I know that because that's all he talks about at Thanksgiving every year.
[215:09.38]So we all have memorized it by now.
[215:12.56]Top 50 variety streamer, of course.
[215:15.06]So they know.
[215:17.45]And that's what they have to see when they type in Jerma985.
[215:22.07]And that's probably the new one.
[215:25.22]I'm going to be honest with you.
[215:26.20]Take a look at that image.
[215:26.90]I'm going to go over this image.
[215:29.96]You want me to talk about the fucking energy that I have?
[215:36.03]I'm going to show you this.
[215:38.33]Look at this shit.
[215:40.67]Well, we struggle to stay live, apparently.
[215:45.75]Here.
[215:45.95]Here.
[215:55.89]Look at this.
[215:57.65]Look at how much blood goes up into my brain.
[216:01.17]You want to know how smart I am?
[216:02.76]How intelligent I am?
[216:03.60]It's because that is carrying so much fucking liquid energy all around my body.
[216:19.06]Let's examine my face.
[216:24.35]You know what?
[216:25.73]20-20 hindsight, I should have been a runner.
[216:31.20]Look at this one, too.
[216:32.42]Take a look at that one.
[216:34.70]Look at this one down here, right below my chin.
[216:36.44]Look at how huge that one is.
[216:39.14]Look at that.
[216:39.96]That's taken so much blood up there.
[216:44.27]That's a tube like this thick.
