[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.51]My mic wasn't plugged in.
[00:07.23]I hope it sounds okay.
[00:08.77]Because it was not plugged in.
[00:11.23]And I just jammed it in and pressed start now.
[00:15.44]Why was this not plugged in?
[00:17.00]I was sitting there going, why can I not hear anything?
[00:18.68]Oh, stream sucks.
[00:28.78]Hi, guys.
[00:29.00]How you doing?
[00:32.09]Welcome back.
[00:35.58]Somebody said, we can only be so patient, Andy.
[00:37.96]Are you talking about me?
[00:42.86]We can, wait, are you talking about you?
[00:44.66]You're the, we can only be so patient, Andy.
[00:47.90]Or are you calling me Andy?
[00:51.24]Like, we can only be so patient, Andy.
[00:54.83]I'm trying, what does that one mean?
[00:59.05]Hey, what's up, green?
[01:00.47]Oh, I just dropped that.
[01:02.99]I'm fine.
[01:07.13]Promise us you won't be late next time.
[01:10.25]I'm late every single time, but here's the thing.
[01:16.37]Look, it's time for defense.
[01:19.16]It's time for defense.
[01:21.66]When my stream turns on, I'm here.
[01:25.06]It's like, boom.
[01:27.62]Data goes in.
[01:28.66]30 seconds later, what's up?
[01:34.07]don't get a 20 minute countdown I don't have a 10 to 15 minute countdown on the screen I don't have a 30 minute countdown I'm here and I'm ready when I press that button see that's true what's your point you can't true me and then say you can't true me and then say what's the point
[02:02.67]I like this method.
[02:04.69]I'm here.
[02:05.99]And I'm ready.
[02:10.65]True but not based.
[02:11.95]Is that possible?
[02:12.67]How does that work?
[02:16.25]You can be true but not based.
[02:18.23]Is that how that works?
[02:22.00]Who makes these rules, by the way?
[02:25.52]Anyways, today we're going to play Inscription.
[02:27.56]It's that scary card game that I've heard all about.
[02:33.43]Seems pretty crazy.
[02:34.53]I don't know anything about it besides it exists.
[02:37.28]And I know that I'm kind of late to the party here, but that's good for you.
[02:41.10]Because you get to see all the funny moments when I get scared by the cards that pop out and jump scare me or something.
[02:46.28]Because you played this game.
[02:49.64]And we're starting late today.
[02:52.09]Well, I told you we were going to stream maybe on Monday or Tuesday.
[02:56.61]So here we are on Monday.
[02:59.41]I had stuff to do earlier this afternoon, but I'm here now.
[03:05.75]Also going to be live tomorrow, too.
[03:08.36]Let me make that clear.
[03:12.36]So they'll be streamed tomorrow.
[03:14.50]I want to do... There's a few things that are going to happen here over the next couple of days.
[03:18.27]I want to make it very clear what the kind of plan is.
[03:21.43]I'll reiterate it a little bit later, but... Ludwig and I want to do that Elden Ring PvP kind of community champions night.
[03:36.13]So, I am going to do, in the next day or so, we're going to do Elden Ring PvP again.
[03:43.01]And I've got to find my champions.
[03:46.12]Because I'm not fighting Ludwig.
[03:49.56]We're picking champions.
[03:56.81]So, I've got to make sure I get the right ones.
[04:01.22]Yeah, I already know a few.
[04:03.30]I already know a few that I need to find and get, you know, find them.
[04:09.67]But maybe not.
[04:12.27]Maybe tomorrow.
[04:13.69]Or Wednesday.
[04:14.47]I'm not sure yet.
[04:15.13]I'll figure it out.
[04:16.75]But I am holding what is essentially tryouts.
[04:26.39]We're going to see if we can make it work.
[04:32.81]Do an IRL Elden Ring stream.
[04:37.14]Where I just, like, dodge roll stuff.
[04:44.55]You know, that's actually kind of funny.
[04:49.19]I'm not...
[04:52.54]Don't, like, one guy me and make me, like, go get, like, sponsors and make me spend fucking hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up, like, I'm doing, like, I'm, like, in a Dark Souls dungeon, like, going and picking up items and have to dodge roll shit.
[05:09.74]Don't, like, don't, you're gonna make me, you're gonna make me go do that.
[05:11.70]Are you gonna make me do that?
[05:17.88]Like, I, there's a boss at the end that I have to fight.
[05:21.65]And I die like fucking 50 times.
[05:23.61]That's so stupid.
[05:33.44]No one's forcing you.
[05:38.36]It would be a LARP?
[05:41.06]I'd have to get... I'd have to go and get the shortcut and stuff.
[05:44.48]Would that even last more than like an hour?
[05:52.82]Have like two or three bosses and have a main boss at the end.
[05:56.42]I would want to include chat somehow though.
[06:02.20]And just train and do animations as a person in real life.
[06:13.82]Have idle animations.
[06:16.80]LARP stream.
[06:18.10]IRL fall joke.
[06:19.04]Yeah, I walk off a cliff and fucking die.
[06:20.75]A little fake, but you know.
[06:30.82]Just sit there and chug an Estus, and then get killed in one hit?
[06:40.14]Okay, alright, well, here's the thing.
[06:42.34]Um... I'm gonna write this down, because this is... This is really stupid, and I kind of... I kind of want to, like, explore this a little.
[06:52.26]Be in full armor?
[06:59.85]This is going to be fucking a little hard though, whatever.
[07:07.63]Chat will spawn enemies.
[07:15.70]Oh good, you haven't started yet.
[07:16.96]I was heating up my... yeah.
[07:18.20]Is this going to be expensive?
[07:23.03]Whatever.
[07:29.19]The cost of a show does not bother me.
[07:31.13]It's being able to actually pay for it.
[07:35.64]I'll actually be able to dodge IRL.
[07:38.10]And I'm going to tell these actors.
[07:39.22]I'm going to be like, fucking try to hit me with that axe.
[07:42.66]I'm not kidding.
[07:43.20]I don't want this to be like, oh, we're actors.
[07:45.70]Oh, I'm like swinging really slowly.
[07:47.76]No, try to fucking hit me with that axe.
[07:49.97]And I'm going to dodge it.
[07:50.61]You know what I mean?
[07:52.67]Like, I got to go all in.
[07:57.03]Not a real axe!
[07:58.29]No, not... Not a real axe, guys.
[08:02.84]I'm saying... I... Well, maybe it had, like, foam or something.
[08:07.73]Whatever it is.
[08:09.51]But I want that person.
[08:10.53]I want it to be... I don't want it to be like... Oh, I'm swinging, and you're gonna put your hand up and block it, and I know you are.
[08:18.93]So we're both gonna go two miles per hour and pretend to hit each other.
[08:23.55]No, I want this to look fucking crazy.
[08:25.59]I want it to look good.
[08:26.93]I want that actor to fucking try to hit me as hard as he can.
[08:30.54]I'm gonna take that actor aside and be like, hey, what's up, man?
[08:32.92]Um, this little, this foam thing, like, can you practice?
[08:35.66]Just hit me, like, in the back with it, like, five times.
[08:38.02]It's gonna be like, that doesn't hurt.
[08:40.36]That doesn't hurt that much.
[08:41.18]Alright, I want you to hit me in the head.
[08:43.35]You know what I mean?
[08:44.33]Like, I'm gonna be dodging it.
[08:45.71]It's gonna be real.
[08:47.29]I'm method acting.
[08:53.13]This shit's gonna be made out of, like, fucking pillows and foam, guys.
[08:56.99]We're gonna make sure that doesn't hurt.
[08:58.01]We're gonna make sure it's, like, getting hit by air.
[09:07.99]Jack gets to choose the stats you level up.
[09:09.73]Well, they can't- I don't think sorcery could exist.
[09:17.01]Don't worry, he's an expert at hand-to-hand combat.
[09:22.36]I'm not.
[09:23.88]What about lightning bolts?
[09:24.86]I mean, I could get- I guess we could make it interesting.
[09:29.04]Fireworks?
[09:33.98]Casting one glintstone bolt at somebody and I have to light a Roman candle?
[09:40.76]No, that's not... I'm not shooting... That's dangerous.
[09:43.08]I don't want to do that.
[09:47.02]I'm not doing anything that could actually hurt anybody.
[09:48.80]We'll figure it out.
[10:02.38]Use a flashlight.
[10:03.34]That would actually be kind of funny.
[10:05.64]But like a little pretend like... Yeah, I actually kind of like this idea.
[10:14.17]And here's the problem though.
[10:16.51]This is the bad part.
[10:19.41]This was a great idea six months ago.
[10:22.59]So a week or two after Elden Ring came out, I could do this stream.
[10:26.93]This is now going to be about four to six months of planning.
[10:31.61]And Elden Ring is going to kind of be in the rear view for a lot of people, I think, in a year.
[10:38.98]It doesn't have to be like a FromSoftware kind of parody.
[10:43.44]This is an action-adventure dungeon that is very heavily inspired by Dark Souls.
[10:51.98]Alright, I'm writing it down.
[10:52.74]I actually am.
[10:54.48]I'm actually writing it down because this could be, like, fun.
[10:57.88]Bring in a bunch of set designers and make a Dark Souls dungeon?
[11:02.65]This is actually, um, yeah.
[11:04.93]I think I could make this work.
[11:05.89]Alright.
[11:12.01]I see in like a year when the guy in chat goes, Hey, I said IRL Elden Ring.
[11:18.81]And he spent $400,000 on a stream.
[11:21.23]You can thank that guy.
[11:29.96]Alright.
[11:30.20]So anyways.
[11:36.84]We're going to get into inscription.
[11:49.70]IRL Malenia.
[11:51.44]It actually would be so funny if I kept dying to a boss and I was just yelling into the camera.
[11:59.20]Like talking shit to the camera.
[12:01.71]Like this is fucking bullshit.
[12:03.25]This boss sucks.
[12:04.19]That mechanic is absolutely broken.
[12:06.35]I complain for like 10 minutes into the camera.
[12:10.83]And then like while I'm complaining, I'm backing up and I just drop like off the cliff and it says like you died.
[12:18.07]Oh, this could be good.
[12:20.21]Oh, this could be very good.
[12:21.95]I'm actually really into this.
[12:23.45]Alright, I'm not going to tell you anything else.
[12:37.44]Can you help me with my chemistry homework?
[12:38.92]No, I don't really know anything about chemistry.
[12:40.30]Okay, inscription.
[12:43.56]Here it is.
[12:48.82]Let's do it.
[12:49.24]Hi.
[12:55.98]So how does this game work?
[12:56.70]Is this a scary game?
[13:02.08]Is this a scary game?
[13:02.66]I got the Pac-Man shirt on today.
[13:05.76]Oops.
[13:05.98]Alright, this is a scary game.
[13:09.00]Lights off.
[13:09.62]It's not dark yet.
[13:13.89]The lights aren't even on.
[13:20.51]This is not a lights off game.
[13:21.97]Don't do that.
[13:22.47]It's a PC.
[13:41.09]It's an old PC.
[13:44.65]I'm sorry.
[13:44.97]That was fucking horrible.
[13:46.65]Inscription.
[13:52.83]Turn the lights off.
[13:53.79]I'm not, I can't turn the lights off.
[13:58.13]I'm not stealing this from like XQC's community, okay?
[14:01.43]Like, oh, lights off!
[14:03.88]I love that guy.
[14:04.74]Yeah.
[14:05.12]Oh, yep.
[14:09.72]Oh, cool.
[14:15.54]See, I do too.
[14:20.13]This just makes me look weird.
[14:24.25]Cat, this is not a lights-off game.
[14:25.87]Is that?
[14:26.13]Am I?
[14:26.69]Okay, whatever.
[14:27.15]Okay, new game.
[14:29.09]Options.
[14:29.39]Should I turn anything up or down?
[14:30.31]What should I do here?
[14:33.81]Uh, flicker effects.
[14:35.04]Nope.
[14:35.54]Screen shake.
[14:36.28]No, thank you.
[14:39.02]Uh, text speed.
[14:39.56]That's probably fine.
[14:41.02]Noise effect.
[14:41.66]Turn that off.
[14:42.48]Full screen, please.
[14:43.56]And let's get it on ultra.
[14:45.10]Brightness.
[14:46.18]Turn the brightness up a little bit so it's not so dark.
[14:48.01]What do you mean, why?
[14:51.91]I don't like when any of that shit is in my games.
[14:57.88]No, I don't like it.
[14:58.62]I don't like when anything's like... Put screen shake on maximum.
[15:07.73]Alright, music volume, I always turn it down.
[15:10.13]That should be fine, like that.
[15:13.17]Turn the noise back on.
[15:14.33]Alright, I'm going to turn the noise back on, and if I don't like it, it's going off immediately.
[15:19.69]Okay, let's go.
[15:26.77]Like, I can't start a new game?
[15:29.72]Why?
[15:37.46]Continue.
[15:37.98]I haven't played this.
[15:43.61]I haven't played this game.
[16:00.46]A little challenger.
[16:01.48]It has been ages.
[16:03.50]Perhaps you have forgotten how this game is played.
[16:06.32]Allow me to remind you.
[16:07.90]Voice acting.
[16:11.04]Play the squirrel card.
[16:12.08]Does it matter where?
[16:19.32]Now play your stoat.
[16:23.74]Stoats cost one blood.
[16:25.40]Sacrifices must be made.
[16:28.51]So I have to... Okay.
[16:31.12]An honorable death.
[16:31.82]Play the stoat.
[16:32.52]Okay, this is one attack, three health.
[16:39.02]Wolves require two sacrifices.
[16:40.99]You don't have enough.
[16:42.91]Ring the bell to end your turn and commence combat.
[16:47.87]Your stoat stands unopposed.
[16:50.77]The number on the bottom left is its attack power.
[16:54.22]Yeah.
[16:56.51]Okay.
[16:57.13]Just like Hearthstone.
[16:58.87]You still dealt me one damage.
[17:00.29]I added it to the scale.
[17:03.81]You win if you tip my side all the way down.
[17:09.58]Like this.
[17:14.44]My turn.
[17:14.84]Okay, your stoat stands in the way of my coyote.
[17:19.63]Alright, so I live.
[17:22.13]My coyote did 2 damage to your stoat.
[17:25.13]That means your stoat's health is 2 less.
[17:27.23]How come that didn't kill it?
[17:28.87]These aren't Hearthstone rules?
[17:34.18]If a creature's health reaches 0, it dies.
[17:38.62]It's your turn.
[17:41.16]You may draw from your deck, or you may draw a squirrel.
[17:46.44]Which doesn't matter.
[17:48.10]I'm going to draw a squirrel.
[17:49.84]How dull.
[17:52.78]Well, no, because if I play the squirrel, then the wolf can come up and sacrifice two people.
[17:59.03]Okay, so let's put a squirrel out there.
[18:00.51]And then I'm going to play the wolf.
[18:05.41]Right here.
[18:08.65]Drop the wolf down.
[18:11.36]suffering it's suffering was real but you will see it again okay got the wolf out uh that's it right because you are learning I will pass again the choice a random card from your deck or the certainty of a squirrel let me just take a random card a river snapper
[18:40.79]Can I see what it does?
[18:42.51]I can't do anything.
[18:46.18]Oh, shit.
[18:46.96]Three weights on the scale.
[18:49.14]Pass.
[18:51.00]Squirrel.
[18:52.74]Put squirrel out.
[18:54.78]Back it up.
[18:55.74]Pass.
[18:57.68]I win.
[18:57.90]If I won this match, they won't all be so easy.
[19:07.38]Let me recall your story.
[19:10.39]Oh, yes.
[19:12.06]Pale blood, you say?
[19:13.62]You were lost deep in the forest.
[19:15.38]A single path revealed itself.
[19:25.81]Two denizens of the forest approached you tentatively.
[19:28.79]Okay.
[19:31.85]A cat.
[19:32.83]The undying cat, sacrificing the poor beast, does not kill it.
[19:39.37]The caustic adder.
[19:40.69]Damage from its poison bite is always lethal.
[19:45.55]Only one may grace your paltry deck.
[19:49.49]Snake or cat.
[19:53.82]I feel like the adder.
[19:57.62]Everyone's saying cat.
[19:58.34]Is it cat?
[19:59.22]I thought I would assume it would be snake.
[20:00.82]Oh, it's only one sacrifice needed.
[20:03.95]Turn the music up.
[20:15.56]Go, dude.
[20:16.00]I'll take the cap.
[20:21.56]Sure.
[20:22.68]Another creature joins your caravan.
[20:27.68]Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you.
[20:37.67]You came across an abandoned sack.
[20:40.53]You found a squirrel in a bottle.
[20:41.99]Break it in case of an emergency.
[20:45.44]And I have a second.
[20:46.35]Another useful implement.
[20:49.33]I'll allow you to tip the scales with it.
[20:53.01]Like, items?
[20:53.87]Three is as much as you can carry.
[20:58.41]He's gonna take ten hours on Act 1 alone, don't worry.
[21:07.76]You were ambushed while crossing some rough terrain.
[21:09.96]Alright, so... Let's go.
[21:15.33]You sacrificed me while I was sleeping.
[21:16.97]It was the right play.
[21:18.25]I get it.
[21:18.67]Maybe you'll help me.
[21:23.23]Play along for now.
[21:26.99]You may now see my moves ahead of time.
[21:30.73]Um.
[21:32.99]Wolf cub.
[21:33.59]What does that mean?
[21:36.43]A card bearing this sigil will grow into a more powerful form after one turn on the board.
[21:40.64]Alright, we gotta get rid of that.
[21:41.38]What's this?
[21:42.92]Boulder?
[21:43.28]It's just in the way.
[21:46.06]Stump.
[21:46.38]Alright, these things are just blocking.
[21:47.52]So what do we got?
[21:48.68]I got a cat.
[21:52.11]Uh, I have to put a squirrel up.
[21:55.75]Squirrel, ugh.
[21:59.13]Squirrel's gonna go here.
[22:00.09]And then that's all I can do, right?
[22:03.27]Let's go.
[22:04.03]And turn.
[22:04.77]Wait, is there any, is there mana?
[22:10.54]Mind the ambitious wolf cub, it ages swiftly.
[22:12.88]Is there mana in this game?
[22:22.49]Give me another squirrel.
[22:24.55]Alright, we'll go and squirrel here.
[22:26.41]And then I'm doing, what is the river snapper?
[22:28.23]One and six.
[22:28.87]Okay, I should do the river snapper, probably.
[22:32.99]If I do river snapper, I can put the river snapper here and it'll last a long time.
[22:36.44]Can I move the boulder?
[22:37.22]Oh wait, I'll do cat here instead.
[22:42.20]Right?
[22:42.54]Yeah, I think so.
[22:43.24]I don't know.
[22:43.66]Because this comes back.
[22:49.98]Okay, this does not perish.
[22:51.12]Okay, now, now... Now... Check this out.
[22:59.58]What?
[23:00.78]Oh.
[23:02.58]Uh, river snapper here?
[23:04.53]Or stoat here?
[23:05.67]Which is better?
[23:06.09]Probably river snapper, why not?
[23:08.47]Listen to your mods.
[23:12.17]What's happening?
[23:16.57]My mic is rumbling?! !
[23:30.07]Hold on.
[23:55.90]Okay, I think I got it.
[23:57.54]We good?
[23:58.60]I think we're good.
[24:01.75]How's this?
[24:03.27]Are we back?
[24:03.79]Are we good and normal?
[24:04.43]Back?
[24:04.69]We good?
[24:06.35]Better?
[24:07.39]Should be good?
[24:08.17]Yeah.
[24:08.51]Alright, I don't know why that happened.
[24:11.26]Sorry about that.
[24:11.74]Alright, so now I'm going- I'm just gonna go River Snapper because it's cool and it's a turtle and I'm gonna put it right here.
[24:17.22]Wait, should I sacrifice the cat?
[24:18.18]I have to do both anyways.
[24:20.52]I'm gonna go over here.
[24:22.08]Bingo.
[24:24.84]And, I'm gonna sacrifice this fucking thing and I'm putting this over here.
[24:32.24]Here we go.
[24:32.68]Alright, he's got a bat.
[24:40.33]The airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly.
[24:48.05]My bat flew right over your stove.
[24:49.49]That's stupid.
[24:50.45]Alright, I want a random card.
[24:54.05]Wolf.
[24:56.43]Alright, what's on the board right now?
[24:59.05]This will kill this.
[25:02.81]This is just kind of to be able to feed me.
[25:08.57]So this will kill that.
[25:09.57]This is going to get through this, but it's alright.
[25:15.12]There are three kills on the board right now.
[25:18.82]What?
[25:28.60]Can I even do anything?
[25:30.64]I could sacrifice these two and put the wolf out, but would that help?
[25:34.78]I think I'm just going to pass.
[25:38.59]Okay.
[25:41.99]Now I'm going to pull out a squirrel.
[25:43.49]Check this shit out.
[25:44.87]Squirrel going right here.
[25:47.86]Wolf is going to eat these two.
[25:49.96]Wolf going down right here.
[25:51.20]Bingo.
[25:52.44]Get rid of you.
[25:54.14]And that should give me a 1, 2, 3, 4.
[25:55.66]And here we go.
[26:00.78]Another wolf.
[26:02.02]I think I just kill him right now.
[26:06.27]Just pass.
[26:10.33]Yeah.
[26:12.11]You prevailed and trekked onwards past the now bloody terrain.
[26:15.32]See?
[26:15.56]Somebody thought I was going to be on there for 10 hours.
[26:23.20]New card.
[26:30.39]The young wolf cub grows into a wolf after a single turn.
[26:32.89]A meek sparrow.
[26:36.27]An inexpensive, if feeble, flying creature.
[26:38.42]What do you think, chat?
[26:51.00]This seems better, but I kinda like the way that this can just fly over everything.
[26:59.70]I'll take the wolf.
[27:00.32]That sounds... I mean... Never mind, I was gonna say something stupid that would like, literally be clipped for the rest of my life.
[27:07.58]What's this?
[27:07.92]Oh no!
[27:29.18]I don't want to get rid of the cat.
[27:30.01]The cat's perfect.
[27:30.95]I want the cat.
[27:35.07]The cat is just a free mana every time.
[27:42.58]I kind of like this.
[27:44.88]I just got this, but it sucks.
[27:51.42]Pick me.
[27:53.35]Wait, what?
[27:58.84]Wait, what's going on here?
[27:59.90]I'm confused.
[28:00.46]Wait, hold on, back up.
[28:01.66]What happened?
[28:02.36]I thought I was sacrificing... What's going on?
[28:08.74]I'm sacrificing this?
[28:12.14]What an honor.
[28:15.66]A ghastly spectacle, but the soul of the wolf cub now lives in the stoat.
[28:21.91]Oh, it like consumes the card.
[28:23.97]I get it.
[28:25.51]I get it, okay.
[28:27.91]Let's go with the flow, man.
[28:28.77]Yeah, I got it.
[28:29.79]I'll figure it out.
[28:30.27]I hold my totem.
[28:35.69]It inscribes my canine cards with the airborne sigil.
[28:42.48]He's completely insane, you see that?
[28:44.48]Right?
[28:46.32]No... pathetic, really.
[28:47.90]No care for his cards.
[28:50.40]Only keeps me around to watch me suffer.
[28:57.79]He's going to lean forward and it's going to be the soft space.
[29:03.83]Okay, so let's get a squirrel.
[29:04.88]What do you have?
[29:06.94]These things can fly.
[29:07.82]Alright, two in one.
[29:18.62]Back on the board.
[29:19.33]Okay, I think that's all I can do, right?
[29:25.93]Oh, it has to... Oh, I get it.
[29:27.66]Okay.
[29:29.72]I thought... Okay, they have to be... It's the card directly in front.
[29:33.00]It doesn't go all the way back.
[29:33.90]My totem has granted my card the power of flight.
[29:40.12]I just lost.
[29:40.64]I need a squirrel right now.
[29:51.26]And then... What is the wolf?
[29:54.42]Yeah, wolf.
[29:59.36]Oh shit, hold on.
[30:10.66]Right?
[30:14.04]Yeah.
[30:14.26]Am I doing this right?
[30:17.26]This thing can fly.
[30:19.74]Can I move these around or no?
[30:23.78]I think I'm going to take a random card.
[30:27.08]Oh.
[30:28.34]This is a bad idea.
[30:39.62]You're three damage away from winning.
[30:40.84]Okay.
[30:42.70]Whatever.
[30:42.96]I'll take the hit.
[30:43.54]Doesn't matter.
[30:45.26]Okay.
[30:45.52]Now I'm going to take a... I think I just won.
[30:50.26]I won.
[30:51.06]Use the pillar?
[30:53.99]Use the pillars?
[30:54.53]What do you mean?
[30:57.41]No.
[30:57.61]Yeah.
[30:57.75]I win.
[30:58.03]That's it.
[31:03.41]How do I... Do I have to play something?
[31:08.06]Okay.
[31:08.30]I win.
[31:08.50]Yeah.
[31:12.35]What's that?
[31:13.13]The pillars?
[31:14.73]Oh, the pliers.
[31:15.57]Okay, you're gonna survive, maybe.
[31:17.79]Knock on wood.
[31:22.44]That's how I do it.
[31:32.44]Raven.
[31:32.81]Skunk.
[31:35.03]Skunk.
[31:36.54]Or sparrow.
[31:37.08]What does a skunk do again?
[31:38.94]I... Okay.
[31:41.13]Stinky.
[31:41.53]This creature opposing a card bearing this sigil loses one power.
[31:45.03]A card bearing this sigil will strike an opponent directly even if there is a creature opposing it.
[31:53.27]So this just flies over and hits.
[31:55.09]This thing smells.
[31:57.92]I feel like this thing is amazing.
[32:03.54]Stinky is good too.
[32:07.08]I don't want to end up... I feel like I have too many cards that are too sacrifice.
[32:13.97]Isn't this... aren't I like late teching too much?
[32:20.23]I think I need some smaller things.
[32:26.03]A 1-2 fly is busted.
[32:31.05]Go... just go full damage.
[32:32.36]Um, I think I'm gonna do stinky.
[32:34.92]I kind of... I don't know.
[32:35.50]I need some smaller cards.
[32:38.52]Alright, this is a sacrifice pit or a fire.
[32:42.19]What should I do?
[32:43.51]I don't know what this is yet, so I'm going to go this way.
[32:46.25]I haven't seen this yet.
[32:51.89]You came across a small group of survivors.
[32:55.84]Faces shrunken from starvation, they huddled around a campfire.
[33:00.02]They looked upon your group of creatures and beckoned.
[33:03.31]Yeah, this is horseshit.
[33:04.39]I'm not putting anybody here.
[33:05.31]How do I leave?
[33:05.97]How do I do a spinning roundhouse kick to this guy's head and kick it like 500 yards that way?
[33:09.75]They're gonna eat it.
[33:10.51]I don't want them to do that.
[33:12.45]Hmm.
[33:34.20]Are they going to eat this?
[33:38.40]Maybe the river snapper.
[33:39.36]I feel like this is one six.
[33:41.71]That's a lot of health, though.
[33:43.15]One of the wolves.
[33:46.37]I feel like this is alright, but...
[33:53.95]Do the stoat?
[33:54.65]I don't want to kill the stoat.
[33:57.50]Maybe the skunk?
[33:58.64]Is this... Okay.
[33:59.14]I feel like this is going to kill whatever is in here.
[34:03.55]Is this going to kill this?
[34:04.35]Or does it make it stronger?
[34:09.75]Okay, I get it.
[34:10.45]That's actually pretty good, though.
[34:11.99]Because now that will do damage and it takes power away.
[34:16.26]Okay.
[34:16.36]This is pretty cool.
[34:35.17]There's a way out for both of us.
[34:37.45]It's somewhere in this foul cabin.
[34:39.57]What is this?
[34:40.71]Okay, so they can't fly over this.
[34:41.71]And here they are.
[34:47.19]Grizzly bear, that's not good.
[34:49.71]Four, six.
[34:49.97]Oh, shit.
[34:50.19]Um...
[35:06.94]Four or six?
[35:09.70]How am I supposed to handle this?
[35:10.92]I think I have to avoid it.
[35:26.97]Just go for kill.
[35:34.41]Ow!
[35:37.52]What does this do?
[35:45.03]Oh, fuck.
[35:45.55]Oops.
[35:45.99]Okay.
[35:50.57]What the fuck?
[35:51.35]How am I supposed to handle this?
[35:52.79]What do the pliers do again?
[36:00.78]Not now.
[36:01.18]Draw a card first, though.
[36:06.16]This thing is going to kill everything.
[36:09.39]Okay, now what does this do?
[36:11.83]You will place a weight on the scale as the path- Oh.
[36:14.41]So I just put a weight on it.
[36:17.49]Alright, so the squirrel's just gonna die.
[36:19.88]That's fine.
[36:20.36]I think, right?
[36:22.90]Okay, squirrel gets hit.
[36:25.82]Fuck.
[36:30.54]I think I'm dead here.
[36:39.39]Uh... Use the pliers now.
[36:53.42]A well-earned point of damage.
[36:54.96]I didn't think you would really do it.
[36:57.44]What the fuck?
[36:58.50]Okay, can I kill him now?
[37:00.49]No, I just lose.
[37:01.31]I don't... I think I just die here.
[37:07.43]Maybe not.
[37:10.82]I think I just have to put a squirrel down and just let it die.
[37:13.46]I can't take this many hits.
[37:23.24]What am I supposed to do?
[37:27.24]What am I supposed to do about this?
[37:35.19]Just don't get hit.
[37:37.33]I mean, I'm just gonna...
[37:42.52]This spot, you sure?
[37:43.60]I don't know.
[37:44.83]I can't even do anything.
[37:48.65]What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?
[37:50.19]That was like five grizzlies.
[37:55.01]You lost.
[37:57.89]Using this as a learning opportunity may be the only way to mitigate my disappointment.
[38:02.38]Get up.
[38:03.42]Get up from the table.
[38:08.56]Catch me the candlestick from atop the barrel beside the door.
[38:16.62]What the fuck?
[38:29.66]Bring it here.
[38:36.29]Ugh!
[38:38.87]Wait, can I just leave?
[38:45.46]Honestly, is this the scenario right here?
[38:48.24]Uh, yeah.
[38:49.90]I'm going.
[38:50.68]I'm sprinting forward.
[38:52.12]And just wild swinging.
[38:54.84]And like screaming and my hands coming out like this.
[38:57.00]And I don't even know what's... I'm just gonna be... I'm just gonna be stabbing and swinging, biting and screaming.
[39:00.62]And just stabbing.
[39:02.87]Right?
[39:03.21]Like I... That's how I'm getting out.
[39:10.77]Sit back down.
[39:20.73]Let me explain something to you.
[39:26.67]That was one of the two mistakes you can make here.
[39:30.17]If you make another, I must sacrifice you.
[39:34.71]Now, where were we?
[39:38.63]What?
[39:45.57]Read the clock.
[39:48.86]Okay, I should probably go right, because this will give me... You have two lives.
[39:53.72]I get it.
[39:54.14]Okay.
[39:59.18]I'm gonna go this way.
[40:04.05]Ooh.
[40:08.39]Uh-huh.
[40:11.37]Ooh.
[40:12.11]What's this?
[40:15.35]What do these mean?
[40:18.13]I mean, I'm taking the grizzly.
[40:19.09]Why the hell would I not?
[40:21.19]But what do these two mean?
[40:22.07]These two little dollops?
[40:24.49]Means you already have them?
[40:26.51]Of course I'm taking the grizzly.
[40:30.28]What, are you out of your mind?
[40:33.28]And I'm gonna put the grizzly up here so the grizzly does even more damage.
[40:38.26]Grizzly's gonna be un-fucking-beatable.
[40:43.53]There's room for a creature around the fire.
[40:45.53]There is.
[40:47.05]The warmth will enhance its health.
[40:50.59]One of the survivors said nothing at all, but could not stop licking their lips.
[40:57.68]This is health.
[40:58.34]Maybe it's the turtle.
[41:01.28]No way.
[41:01.74]Should I just have a 4-8 grizzly?
[41:05.34]That would be kind of insane, right?
[41:12.01]Or a 1-5 skunk.
[41:23.88]Wolf would be good.
[41:26.12]Maybe the cat, too.
[41:26.90]3-2.
[41:29.40]Yeah, like a 3-4 sounds really good.
[41:33.44]Really strong.
[41:35.58]You're never going to be able to play the bear.
[41:39.42]Or, what does this turn into?
[41:40.32]Oops.
[41:44.76]How do I take it out?
[41:48.64]More powerful.
[41:49.28]Does it just gain 1-1?
[41:50.02]That would be a 2-5.
[41:57.44]So then, so this would be... Alright, yeah, it gets 2-5.
[42:00.28]Alright, it's probably this then.
[42:04.68]I think I'm going for that.
[42:07.22]Although, that I'm... Then you only need to sacrifice one thing for this.
[42:15.17]He said, pick something else.
[42:18.81]Do I have to listen to him?
[42:21.43]This is the safest one, I think.
[42:24.46]That just gives it a nice strong card, I think.
[42:27.86]I'm going for it.
[42:30.52]3-4.
[42:30.56]That's just a solid 3-4.
[42:38.49]I think that makes sense.
[42:39.35]Alright, this looks like a boss, like a real boss.
[42:41.92]Is this going to be like a tutorial boss where it kills me and sends me back to the beginning or something?
[42:47.56]Don't re-chat?
[42:48.80]Alright, alright, I won't re-chat anymore.
[42:53.18]The trees seemed to close in around you as a chill mist descended.
[42:57.49]In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal on stone.
[43:04.43]Alright, lay out your arms then.
[43:07.95]I'm back already.
[43:08.61]I took you for dead.
[43:10.43]Hee hee ha ha, it was the prospector.
[43:25.14]At the end of the owner's turn, a card bearing the sigil will move in the direction inscribed in the sigil.
[43:29.91]So it goes like this way.
[43:35.59]Like that.
[43:38.56]Okay, so I want to put... Squirrel.
[43:44.54]And then cat.
[43:50.35]Squirrel.
[43:51.75]And get that cat down.
[43:56.72]And then put the skunk down.
[44:02.92]Whoops.
[44:04.00]Sorry.
[44:08.01]Is it alright?
[44:08.49]I think I did this wrong.
[44:13.43]Uh... I did this wrong.
[44:16.47]This is bad.
[44:17.07]Okay, I'm gonna... This might be stupid, but I'm gonna do this.
[44:21.80]And then we don't do this yet.
[44:25.66]Did I do it?
[44:27.92]It's only a 3-2!
[44:28.76]What?
[44:28.98]Alright, I'm done.
[44:30.14]Okay.
[44:36.44]Who cares?
[44:36.91]It comes right back.
[44:41.22]Where is it?
[44:46.56]Doesn't it come back?
[44:47.37]It doesn't come back?
[44:48.29]Why?
[44:48.55]Okay, um... I fucked this up so bad, didn't I?
[45:02.48]Alright, I can save it, I think.
[45:03.90]What's over here?
[45:04.42]I can save it, I can save it, I can save it.
[45:06.82]I fucked up.
[45:08.56]I fucked up, it's okay.
[45:09.48]I fucked up.
[45:11.21]I fucked up.
[45:14.49]Sir, I fucked up.
[45:19.98]There we go, alright.
[45:21.52]Okay, I fucked up.
[45:28.40]Now... I do squirrel.
[45:36.24]And... Sacrifice him.
[45:43.38]This will go forward and... Okay, I can take a few hits.
[45:45.70]I think I'm okay.
[45:47.19]This is salvageable.
[45:50.13]I fucked up.
[45:50.73]Did I put Squirrel over here on the left, probably?
[45:58.66]I can take a couple hits.
[46:02.59]I'm going to put the squirrel on the left.
[46:03.65]Stop looking at chat.
[46:06.03]Dude, I'm a streamer.
[46:07.89]My eyes are glued over here.
[46:11.11]I'm a live streamer.
[46:14.45]I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[46:18.43]Like, that's what we do.
[46:19.35]Alright, I'm not looking over here anymore.
[46:20.95]I'm almost at the fucking end of the game.
[46:33.22]I win.
[46:33.82]I win right now.
[46:34.54]I won.
[46:36.96]I won.
[46:38.34]Game over.
[46:38.70]I win.
[46:40.36]Bring it.
[46:43.78]What?
[46:47.46]Hope you didn't think it'd be that easy.
[46:56.69]Gold!
[46:57.05]I've struck gold!
[46:59.39]Oh, this is bad.
[47:02.23]What does this do?
[47:06.51]Old nugget?
[47:08.33]Why it doesn't have a description?
[47:16.22]I want to read what this does You're dead Well, I can't do what I can't I can't I just have to kill the I I have to block the damage somehow
[47:35.51]What the fuck?
[47:35.99]What's horseshit?
[47:36.73]What?
[47:38.67]What happened?
[47:39.13]How did I lose so badly?
[47:40.19]He's doing the prospector again.
[47:46.22]Easy boss.
[47:47.18]The mule's key.
[47:51.38]What's that?
[47:59.73]Um, I just lost.
[48:10.97]What happens now?
[48:11.61]More gold for me!
[48:33.57]You aren't dead yet.
[48:34.63]This isn't purgatory.
[48:37.11]Though you may think of it that way.
[48:40.47]There are some cards from your mediocre deck.
[48:43.55]We can put them to good use.
[49:08.31]Please choose a card to draw the cost from.
[49:10.55]They both cost two.
[49:14.31]Doesn't matter.
[49:17.13]Cost of two blood from the river sapper.
[49:18.89]They're both two.
[49:24.10]Add another.
[49:24.54]This time I will use its power and health.
[49:27.46]The numbers.
[49:32.28]Four six, right?
[49:33.11]I mean, like, that's a bear.
[49:34.41]Is this a bad thing?
[49:36.53]Four six.
[49:39.77]More power and six health from the grizzly.
[49:43.42]Now choose a card from which we will extract the sigils.
[49:47.92]Oh, and it can live forever!
[49:49.28]Is this what I get?
[49:51.96]Or does it stink?
[49:54.00]This can live forever?
[49:58.02]Or the stink.
[49:58.94]I think the stink might be great.
[50:01.76]You can sacrifice it forever.
[50:04.88]It's definitely the cat, without a doubt.
[50:09.38]So now what?
[50:10.20]I never did ask you your name.
[50:11.56]This is my card?
[50:25.25]There is now but one final matter.
[50:28.51]The portrait.
[50:49.05]Here we go again.
[50:50.21]Another challenger.
[50:52.27]Perhaps it is time.
[50:53.70]Perhaps you can understand bones.
[50:58.76]The resourceful opossum costs two bones.
[51:03.50]You gain a bone when one of your creatures perishes for any reason.
[51:07.49]Yo, I think I just fucking won the game.
[51:16.33]This is cool.
[51:19.13]This is cool.
[51:22.73]This is cool.
[51:23.83]Alright, so there's a Rattler there.
[51:25.77]It's one health.
[51:26.63]So we're going to go like this.
[51:27.51]Bingo.
[51:28.85]We're going to go bingo here.
[51:33.35]Drop that down.
[51:36.10]From the death of your creature, you've gained a bone.
[51:38.26]You will not lose this until it is spent or the battle ends, okay?
[51:41.28]Okay.
[51:46.00]Let's go.
[51:53.99]Oops.
[51:54.59]Oh, I fucked up.
[51:55.77]Sorry.
[51:57.37]Oh, shit.
[51:57.67]Alright.
[51:57.97]I forgot that they had to move down.
[51:59.57]Okay.
[52:02.41]Oops.
[52:02.99]Alright.
[52:03.86]So, wait.
[52:04.12]I can do the possum now, right?
[52:06.46]Oh, I can do the possum.
[52:07.34]1, 1.
[52:14.51]go ahead and get a squirrel down just for shits.
[52:16.76]There we go.
[52:17.10]Okay.
[52:24.40]Pull it back.
[52:29.20]Oh, he's gonna die anyways.
[52:30.92]Oops.
[52:31.92]It's alright.
[52:37.62]Remember, take your pants off.
[52:43.27]Oh, I forgot your figurine.
[52:46.17]Get up and fetch it for me.
[52:50.49]It's beside the safe.
[52:57.07]Hold on a minute here.
[52:57.75]Bullfrog, what does this mean?
[53:03.34]Can I, like, open the safe?
[53:39.54]What time is it?
[53:41.28]What time is it?
[53:42.58]6, 3, 12?
[53:42.80]What time is it?
[53:44.12]Oh, you just got your safe opened, dumbass.
[53:46.63]12, 3, 6.
[53:47.17]That was not 12.
[53:53.15]Never mind.
[54:00.00]Oops.
[54:02.96]Let us continue.
[54:10.08]Ooh, coyote.
[54:11.44]This game is fun.
[54:13.00]This is a good game.
[54:13.66]This game is fun.
[54:16.93]Rattler?
[54:21.37]The unkillable cockroach.
[54:22.93]It returns to your hand after dying.
[54:25.81]Ooh.
[54:34.49]The unkillable... I'm taking the cockroach.
[54:40.18]You know, you're free to get up again.
[54:42.30]Keep your blood flowing.
[54:45.63]I am no tyrant.
[54:46.33]You may stand whenever the map is unrolled.
[54:48.97]It allows me time to plan your next encounter.
[54:51.63]Do keep your hands off my possessions.
[54:55.93]Alright, what do you got here?
[54:57.70]What's going on here?
[54:58.34]I gotta open the safe.
[54:59.56]I need a key.
[55:10.48]Alright, what else do I got?
[55:11.52]I gotta open the safe.
[55:15.76]This means something.
[55:17.40]This means something.
[55:18.22]This is something to do with the time.
[55:21.31]Or the time of day it is.
[55:23.19]What time is the clock?
[55:24.01]It is 1236.
[55:26.65]Okay, I can move these.
[55:28.83]Let's go ahead and think about this for a second here.
[55:30.33]I need three numbers, obviously.
[55:38.86]That hand never changes, by the way.
[55:43.00]This never changes off of midnight.
[55:46.28]Okay.
[55:47.24]So this never changes.
[55:48.26]So what we're going to do is we're going to put the whole thing... We're going to put the whole thing at midnight.
[55:56.06]And then it'll go... Oh.
[56:01.98]Never mind.
[56:08.33]Alright, so I need three numbers, obviously.
[56:10.84]I don't know where I'm going to get them.
[56:11.80]I'll probably get them over the course of the game.
[56:13.88]Alright, well, let's sit down.
[56:18.40]Whatever.
[56:18.88]I'll figure it out.
[56:19.50]What's this?
[56:21.38]Mighty leap.
[56:22.44]Oh, there's two hundred and seven.
[56:23.58]Okay, thank you.
[56:24.26]Two, seven, three.
[56:24.90]You got it.
[56:26.94]That's a two, seven, three right there.
[56:30.64]Excuse me.
[56:35.74]Open.
[56:42.35]Clock.
[56:42.69]273.
[56:43.41]Open.
[56:43.99]Wait, there's another thing.
[56:58.88]There's this.
[56:59.26]273.
[56:59.28]I got it.
[57:08.62]Stink bug.
[57:10.16]Oh, hello.
[57:11.50]I wasn't sure if I would ever escape that iron crypt.
[57:16.46]Is the stoat around?
[57:17.36]The stunted wolf?
[57:19.64]This madness must end.
[57:21.86]Put that away.
[57:25.03]Bro, he's got the key.
[57:27.35]This is where I turn around and I go, look at what I got.
[57:33.33]Hmm.
[57:34.35]Maybe I should put it in here.
[57:39.33]Wow.
[57:39.99]Okay.
[57:40.25]What the fuck is this?
[57:43.09]Two.
[57:44.90]Zero five.
[57:46.66]Um.
[57:50.12]One three.
[57:50.76]Two one.
[57:51.48]Okay.
[58:03.83]Zero five.
[58:08.74]Zero to five.
[58:11.94]Okay, this is like, this kills this.
[58:13.46]So I need to, can I move these around?
[58:18.38]I don't think you guys understand.
[58:19.92]I play these kind of games on iPad almost every single day.
[58:24.07]I mean, I play games like this.
[58:25.77]I've beaten every single, the franchise, The Room.
[58:29.67]I played every single one of those three times.
[58:32.65]I was made to play this.
[58:35.23]Okay, so this is going to do two to one.
[58:36.67]I wonder if I can flip these.
[58:42.06]2, 1, 1, 3.
[58:42.70]Okay, there's 1 out of 5.
[58:47.79]1 out of 5 is right.
[58:48.55]2 out of 5 is correct.
[58:49.91]So now I gotta go like this.
[58:52.13]So this is how much... Wait, I'm trying to do damage.
[58:53.55]I'm trying to kill somebody here, right?
[58:54.51]2 out of 5.
[59:01.74]What am I looking for here?
[59:02.98]This is... What am I looking for?
[59:06.42]1 here.
[59:06.66]Okay, so it's gotta be like this.
[59:12.24]Up a little bit more like that.
[59:14.38]And up here.
[59:15.90]I'm not even sure what's going on here.
[59:25.84]Okay, three out of five.
[59:27.08]So what's happening here?
[59:28.20]Let's take a minute here.
[59:29.58]What's happening here?
[59:30.76]Just relax.
[59:32.74]So this is doing one damage to this character.
[59:35.39]This is doing two damage to this character.
[59:37.09]This is doing three damage to this character.
[59:41.59]It needs to be completely perfectly balanced.
[59:50.27]That's technically right.
[59:53.64]I'm not looking.
[59:58.76]Three out of five.
[60:05.50]Wait a minute.
[60:05.96]Wait a minute.
[60:08.54]Oh, that was easier than I thought it was gonna be!
[60:11.16]I got a stink.
[60:13.44]I forgot that I had put that there.
[60:14.83]Very well, you may add it to your deck and I'll deal you one every so often.
[60:17.93]What does this do?
[60:20.21]Alright, close this thing.
[60:20.89]Give me the next one.
[60:21.97]Alright, so I get it.
[60:22.93]I understand.
[60:23.45]I get it.
[60:27.08]This is locked out here.
[60:31.94]This can't be moved, but this can, because this is flight.
[60:36.12]Got two out of five there.
[60:37.75]Let's go ahead and, uh, make this happen.
[60:39.79]What do you say?
[60:40.37]Three out of five.
[60:42.63]Get that one back.
[60:43.41]If we can, please.
[60:44.05]Thank you.
[60:44.41]This one cannot be moved.
[60:45.49]Two out of five.
[60:47.31]You got it.
[60:47.73]Put this, uh, back up here if we could, please.
[60:51.00]Put this up.
[60:53.50]Here's your two out of five.
[60:54.26]Get that up here, please.
[60:55.22]Here's your two out of five.
[60:58.80]Get that up here if we could, please.
[61:00.86]One out of five.
[61:01.32]Let's put that back down, please.
[61:04.11]I can't move them back and forth.
[61:06.01]Is it two out of five?
[61:06.63]Put that over here, please.
[61:07.33]Let's close with them.
[61:30.82]Three to five.
[61:49.31]Okay, I can't move this one.
[61:51.47]I gotta think.
[61:52.23]I'm not looking.
[62:06.16]Oh, these both fly.
[62:07.57]This is the only thing doing the damage right here, isn't it?
[62:09.59]Wouldn't this do it?
[62:15.51]Here we go.
[62:16.11]I got it.
[62:18.45]I play these games in bed all day.
[62:19.65]Don't worry, I get it.
[62:21.07]Wonderful creatures, those ants.
[62:22.41]Very well, I will add them to your deck and make them available for future challenges.
[62:26.23]Nice.
[62:30.41]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[62:31.39]I'll take all the cards, please.
[62:33.23]Let's make the game easy.
[62:33.97]I don't know what the bug does.
[62:37.45]I need to play a little bit more to figure out what the bug does.
[62:41.31]What about this?
[62:45.13]Can't move this.
[62:47.79]Always check every single crevice.
[62:50.33]Can't do that yet.
[62:50.93]Whatever it is.
[62:51.41]Alright, what do we got here?
[62:54.85]I don't think I can do this yet.
[62:59.40]I'm going to play a little bit.
[63:03.22]Let's do a round.
[63:04.78]Now that I got some new cards, let's go.
[63:11.74]There's some bone tokens for a rainy night.
[63:13.72]That's four.
[63:15.60]If you deem it necessary, you may cut up one of my cards with these.
[63:20.22]A rock might get you out of a hard place.
[63:21.96]That's kind of just a block.
[63:22.84]I'll have to choose one.
[63:29.38]I don't know.
[63:29.82]I'm going to say boulder.
[63:32.99]Just block damage.
[63:37.35]Or the scissors would be good, too.
[63:39.05]Bones are good, too.
[63:47.78]Feeling overburdened enough with the full three items you carried on.
[63:58.68]You again.
[63:59.60]Indeed.
[64:00.36]Our friend freed me.
[64:02.36]Well, I basically told him how to do it.
[64:05.36]You got a plan?
[64:06.94]We have another friend here.
[64:09.60]You've got to be... I wouldn't call him a friend.
[64:12.92]But I suppose we are in deep this time.
[64:17.24]Pretty good boys.
[64:20.19]This guy has three shirts?
[64:24.77]What's going on with my hair?
[64:28.95]Look at my hair.
[64:34.96]Bullfrog, what do we got?
[64:37.72]You are lacking squirrels.
[64:40.18]Mighty leap.
[64:41.40]Card bearing the sigil will block an opposing creature bearing the airborne sigil.
[64:45.45]Alright, so I can put this in front of a bird.
[64:49.13]Let's put a squirrel down.
[64:50.71]Right here sounds good, I think.
[65:02.11]Just put it down now.
[65:04.23]Wait, oh, it takes bone, right?
[65:07.73]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:08.63]Alright, let's go.
[65:15.88]Alright, so now I want...
[65:19.59]What is the stink bug is... Alright, yeah.
[65:22.07]So we're gonna put the stink bug down.
[65:24.30]Let's kill a squirrel.
[65:26.68]Check this out.
[65:28.70]Wait.
[65:31.12]Here.
[65:34.86]Oh, shit!
[65:35.54]I fucked it up.
[65:38.71]It's alright.
[65:39.83]Goddammit, I gotta remember more about that.
[65:44.83]It's okay.
[65:45.27]Okay.
[65:47.33]Okay.
[65:52.17]Back in the game.
[65:52.91]Alright, let's go.
[65:56.53]I screwed... I wanted to put him... Yeah, I screwed up.
[65:58.03]It's fine.
[65:58.29]Give me a squirrel.
[66:04.85]And you'll kill that?
[66:05.63]Sounds good.
[66:08.34]We're good.
[66:08.62]Yeah, that's fine.
[66:11.38]Wolf, I don't need to do anything.
[66:12.38]This game's over anyways.
[66:15.65]How brutal of you.
[66:17.07]You dealt me more damage than you needed to win.
[66:19.11]However, in my game, such feats are rewarded.
[66:22.49]It would be precise of tooth to keep for each extra damage dealt.
[66:28.33]The trapper may be interested in your spoils.
[66:32.41]Wait, I get extra teeth?
[66:38.12]Pretty cool.
[66:40.54]Elk fawn.
[66:41.08]An ascent fawn.
[66:43.28]It quickly grows into an elk.
[66:46.28]And move to the right.
[66:47.12]And what do you do?
[66:52.22]That scared the shit out of me.
[66:55.28]I forgot about that.
[66:56.30]And I was like, the game is reading my hard drive or something.
[66:59.31]I actually freaked out.
[67:05.13]Okay, well, I mean, obviously I'm taking this.
[67:08.88]What is that?
[67:09.42]Six bones.
[67:10.62]I mean, why wouldn't I not take this?
[67:13.09]It's literally like the best thing that I have.
[67:15.75]And I'm going to make it more powerful in the... Why would you... Okay, I have a question.
[67:25.16]Don't spoil the game for me.
[67:26.26]I have a question.
[67:28.68]This is just for free.
[67:31.06]This you have to sacrifice someone.
[67:35.48]What's the kind of difference here?
[67:36.84]Do you get more?
[67:40.02]They do two different things.
[67:43.56]You can get multiple abilities.
[67:47.84]It gives you... It gives card effects.
[67:50.76]Oh, you like essentially absorb the card.
[67:54.56]I wonder if I should do this one.
[67:56.14]I'm doing this.
[68:02.82]The choice is yours.
[68:05.23]Ant Queen.
[68:05.85]What is that?
[68:07.53]When a card bearing the sigil is played, an ant is created in your hand.
[68:12.42]That seems kind of good.
[68:14.42]Good.
[68:16.26]Cockroach.
[68:17.28]When a card bearing the sigil is played, a copy of his... I mean, I'm going to do that with Jerma.
[68:23.09]That seems broken.
[68:24.77]That's absolutely broken.
[68:25.89]I'm guaranteed to beat the game right now.
[68:27.89]I'm going to beat the game right now.
[68:29.17]I'm going to walk through the rest of the game.
[68:34.80]Marvelous.
[68:35.42]I'll go.
[68:35.78]No, Jerma's gone.
[68:40.32]I mean, that's very simple.
[68:45.90]I now am going to get two of these.
[68:49.13]And I'm going to walk through the game.
[68:53.65]This is really cool.
[68:54.29]I like this.
[68:54.67]This is a fun game.
[68:56.29]Now I know why everyone said to play it.
[68:58.43]So strange.
[68:58.97]Why can't I remember his name?
[69:00.97]I believe I lost some of my memory in the flash.
[69:08.86]Oh, these are people that played the game before.
[69:10.86]He made cards for them.
[69:12.64]He took their pictures and now they like cards forever.
[69:14.91]That's what's going to happen to me.
[69:22.22]Ooh, I kind of like that.
[69:23.14]What do you got on the board?
[69:23.78]Okay, so this thing hurts.
[69:35.06]I'm going to be slow game playing Andy, by the way, because I need to pay attention.
[69:49.99]The value represented with this sigil will be equal to the number of ants that the owner has on their side of the table.
[69:58.72]Huh?
[70:04.18]Alright, what do you got?
[70:05.78]That's not gonna help.
[70:06.72]Okay, I need to get this into memory.
[70:30.08]It's hard to call it cowardly.
[70:41.04]I don't understand the ant thing.
[70:51.65]I can't play this?
[70:52.39]Why not?
[70:54.08]Oh, I have to draw first.
[70:54.84]Okay.
[70:55.82]Uh... That was... Uh... Good play.
[71:08.15]Thanks.
[71:11.57]How much damage is this thing doing?
[71:13.51]This thing doesn't have damage.
[71:15.29]Wait, what?
[71:19.08]Does the worker ant not do any damage?
[71:22.42]It's just one?
[71:23.12]Oh.
[71:27.57]Oh, okay.
[71:28.69]Oh, so it's how many ants you currently just have.
[71:31.81]I get it.
[71:40.31]I'm gonna get rid of this guy.
[71:54.96]Get your elbows back.
[71:57.79]I don't know if you're putting shit on the board or not.
[71:59.21]If you get a referee to blow a fucking whistle, that's horri- Don't do that.
[72:02.91]I think I'm doing this.
[72:04.29]I- This is probably stupid.
[72:06.27]This is probably dumb.
[72:07.85]But, I mean... This is dumb.
[72:11.35]What I'm doing.
[72:12.90]This is dumb.
[72:14.06]What I just did was dumb.
[72:15.38]But, whatever.
[72:15.84]I just won the game.
[72:24.24]Maybe it wasn't dumb.
[72:30.39]at Mantis.
[72:34.97]Ooh.
[72:38.56]It hits both left and right.
[72:41.32]And Alpha.
[72:43.92]It boldens the creatures that stand beside it.
[72:45.88]So it gives what?
[72:47.46]Plus one?
[72:47.88]Plus one?
[72:48.26]Alright, so it gives plus one damage to everybody next to it.
[72:52.09]I feel like I want the Mantis.
[72:55.11]I want the Mantis.
[72:58.03]And then I'm gonna make the Mantis stronger.
[73:01.57]By sacrificing something.
[73:04.61]That's what I would do.
[73:08.27]Wait a minute, that's what I would do.
[73:09.25]That's what I'm doing right now.
[73:10.43]I think it's going to have to be you.
[73:29.03]Sacrifice... Wait, I could do... Whoa!
[73:30.43]Wait, I could do the reverse!
[73:32.97]Hold on, I could do the... How do I back up?
[73:34.69]I could do the reverse.
[73:37.27]So if I sacrifice the mantis, I can give it to somebody else.
[73:46.38]Oh, shit.
[73:47.94]Okay.
[73:52.08]Uh, the wolf, probably?
[73:53.50]The wolf would be crazy.
[73:56.00]Or the ant queen?
[73:58.74]Yeah, it's definitely the wolf.
[74:01.62]That's huge.
[74:02.10]What is that?
[74:02.78]What is that thing?
[74:05.72]Greetings.
[74:24.07]Alright, porcupine, this is pretty basic here.
[74:25.75]I'm gonna go, uh... Uh, squirrel.
[74:38.88]Uh... Bullfrog.
[74:43.57]Here.
[74:43.79]Yeah.
[74:46.35]And then... Uh... Oh.
[74:52.33]Uh, yeah.
[74:53.39]Yeah.
[74:55.62]This won't kill it.
[74:56.98]I can sacrifice him afterwards.
[75:00.01]Actually, he'll fly over.
[75:00.81]I wonder if it's worth sacrificing.
[75:02.59]Alright, we got Stink Bug.
[75:05.09]What do you got?
[75:06.71]That'll be a 1-1.
[75:07.67]Okay.
[75:17.51]Shit.
[75:18.33]Um...
[75:26.82]He's gonna die anyways, so I need to get rid of him.
[75:33.95]What do you got?
[75:34.47]Two?
[75:34.73]Okay.
[75:36.93]Hold on.
[75:37.65]Stink bug.
[75:38.49]Hold on.
[75:38.81]Shit.
[75:41.01]I'm... My brain is having trouble here.
[75:43.43]It's like I could... I just gotta pick a play.
[75:44.70]Okay, I'll kill... Um...
[75:58.08]You go here, you'll kill this.
[76:00.68]And then you're gonna go here.
[76:03.08]This will die, but it's okay, because I got this guy coming here.
[76:07.26]And let's go.
[76:10.45]Okay.
[76:11.93]That's fine.
[76:13.53]Okay.
[76:13.97]Whoa, I'm actually about to lose.
[76:15.07]Look!
[76:22.50]Look!
[76:23.82]There's a third talking card somewhere around here.
[76:26.90]Personally, I hate the guy.
[76:29.74]Biggest killjoy ever.
[76:30.84]But he's the only one of us with a plan to get things back to normal.
[77:14.19]That was a misplay?
[77:14.97]What are you, in my chat right now?
[77:17.61]Relax.
[77:17.89]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[77:30.32]Ooh, good draw!
[77:31.84]Awesome.
[77:37.28]Good draw.
[77:49.13]I see the way this is going.
[77:51.03]I concede.
[77:53.10]You may accept my surrender, or you may finish this match the slow way.
[78:01.98]What?
[78:03.94]Why would I do that?
[78:07.60]If I don't get extra tokens if I do a bunch of damage?
[78:16.69]Um...
[78:20.92]Is this a dumb thing that I'm doing?
[78:22.76]Alright, well, hold on.
[78:24.83]If I sacrifice Stote and the opossum, I'll have two and two?
[78:33.15]Right?
[78:36.34]Right?
[78:36.52]That's... Okay.
[78:37.84]Then that should do it.
[78:39.08]And that'll overkill, I think.
[78:40.12]Yep.
[78:44.86]Our number is the Ant's Creed.
[78:48.09]Can't put this out.
[78:50.78]Okay.
[78:52.08]Let's go.
[78:56.82]I get extra, um... Alright, this is gonna be a huge overkill.
[79:11.88]Ooh!
[79:13.71]Fill up that pot.
[79:30.40]What's your opinion on the tectonic plates?
[79:32.90]I... I... What do you... What do you want me to say?
[79:48.98]It's a thing that's, uh... It's a thing that's under the ground and it makes the world shake.
[79:57.62]You were stopped along the way by a trapper looking to liquidate his pelts.
[80:04.95]There was something uncanny about his appearance, but you were quickly distracted by his wares.
[80:12.59]Care to look at my pelts?
[80:17.33]Take a pelt free of charge.
[80:18.53]I don't get it.
[80:28.68]Um, rabbit?
[80:29.60]What do these do?
[80:31.58]See the quality?
[80:36.18]Oh, it's the extra tokens.
[80:39.04]What do they do?
[80:41.92]I can have one for free?
[80:45.36]I don't get it.
[80:50.88]Do I have to do this?
[80:57.62]Take the gold ones.
[80:58.76]I mean, I was gonna take the gold one, but I don't know.
[81:06.29]I'm gonna take the gold one.
[81:07.21]That's what I would do.
[81:11.31]Golden pelt.
[81:13.39]Cool.
[81:15.53]And I'll take a rabbit pelt, too.
[81:20.25]Is this stupid?
[81:24.72]You're leaving already?
[81:26.54]Please consider me pelts.
[81:30.28]Didn't I already take them?
[81:35.13]You'll need... How do I leave?
[81:38.75]I'm done.
[81:39.03]I... Okay.
[81:41.57]Thanks for your business.
[81:43.64]Man assured you of the value of the pelts.
[81:47.04]They appear to be useless in a fight.
[81:51.20]Stop doubting yourself.
[81:52.12]That's all I do.
[81:52.74]Okay.
[81:53.40]I don't know what to do.
[82:25.72]I could sacri- I don't want to run out of- I'm getting rid of all my cards, though.
[82:29.80]No.
[82:30.72]I sacrificed like three cards already, I think.
[82:36.27]Warm light of a campfire, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[82:37.85]Three of the ten hungry eyes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[82:40.99]Enhance its power.
[82:42.01]Alright.
[82:45.23]Stop this.
[82:47.33]It's gonna be wolf, man.
[82:48.12]Are you kidding me?
[82:48.60]Could be me, too.
[83:01.07]I think I'm doing Wolf.
[83:04.09]I haven't seen this card come up once.
[83:08.33]Balance your damage across the cards.
[83:11.53]Yeah, I kind of am just being like a two-card Andy, aren't I?
[83:19.50]I like this one.
[83:20.64]But I also like the Opossum.
[83:21.66]I think I'm going Opossum.
[83:24.10]Yeah.
[83:24.82]Opossum.
[83:25.16]That's what I'm doing.
[83:29.38]That's what I'm doing.
[83:36.40]They had enhanced the creature's power.
[83:39.32]What the fuck?
[83:39.78]What?
[83:39.90]No!
[83:39.96]I wanted- I- That's two bones and it gives me two damage!
[83:45.27]What?! !
[83:58.93]My boss battles are high stakes.
[84:00.33]Tests of your aptitude.
[84:02.13]With one flame, you'll either overcome them or die.
[84:04.29]Fear not.
[84:05.19]I will let you keep the smoke.
[84:14.50]Oh, it's this dude again.
[84:17.00]The incessant clank, clank, clanking.
[84:19.52]It's the prospector.
[84:24.64]The prospector.
[84:25.64]Yeehaw!
[84:28.38]Alright, let's go.
[84:30.92]Again.
[84:32.90]What does this do?
[84:36.02]What does that do?
[84:39.28]Again.
[84:42.01]The smoke.
[84:44.07]When a card bearing the sigil dies, four bones are awarded instead of one.
[84:47.51]Oh, shit.
[84:47.93]Can I just get that out there now?
[84:51.87]Let's get that out there right now.
[84:55.01]Kill the mule first, right?
[84:56.56]That's what the card said.
[84:57.72]Alright.
[84:59.88]This is what I'm going for.
[85:06.32]I'm going for... Get rid of this.
[85:08.52]Put this here.
[85:08.94]I don't know what the pelt does.
[85:12.30]Squirrel.
[85:13.96]Wait.
[85:14.30]Don't be stupid about this.
[85:15.34]I fucked it up already.
[85:21.99]This thing goes right.
[85:22.65]Shit!
[85:27.90]Can I sacrifice that?
[85:31.34]I can.
[85:31.78]Alright, so just sacrifice it.
[85:32.80]I'm good.
[85:33.08]I'm good.
[85:33.30]I'm good.
[85:33.56]I'm good.
[85:33.84]I'm good.
[85:36.66]So, I can just sacrifice this.
[85:39.14]And put down the... What does the most damage?
[85:43.50]One three.
[85:43.76]I'll put you down.
[85:44.22]Good.
[85:45.08]You go here.
[85:47.74]And then... You go... Here.
[85:56.64]and then you go here and then what is that I don't know what this does I'm afraid to use it that's fine rabbit pelt what the fuck I have to you I don't want to use these what do these do
[86:25.56]Why is it going this way?
[86:29.12]This will get killed.
[86:29.80]It's fine.
[86:30.20]I'll be alright.
[86:33.46]They're blockers.
[86:34.34]Alright, I'm just going to put this one down.
[86:36.79]I'm putting this here.
[86:42.75]I'm about to win.
[86:52.21]Perfect.
[86:53.30]This is 2-1.
[86:53.66]Perfect.
[86:54.84]Perfect.
[87:00.68]Go ahead and move over, that's fine.
[87:01.96]Good.
[87:07.36]Alright, this is Super Wolf.
[87:08.52]Super Wolf is gonna take out... ...these two?
[87:11.38]Oh, fuck off.
[87:30.67]Wait, what?
[87:31.25]Oh, it's... Alright, wait.
[87:31.91]Okay.
[87:33.32]I... It goes like that.
[87:34.20]Oops.
[88:02.72]Okay, this is just... Okay.
[88:04.84]I... Do you have to kill this stuff?
[88:08.06]Get him.
[88:08.40]Yeah, please get rid of it.
[88:09.44]I don't... I can't do anything yet.
[88:15.09]Just go.
[88:15.99]Go again.
[88:17.79]I can't do anything yet.
[88:18.95]I'm putting Jerm out next turn.
[88:19.93]Here we go.
[88:21.99]Bingo.
[88:24.73]Squirrel.
[88:26.77]Squirrel.
[88:28.64]Boing.
[88:29.00]Boing.
[88:30.46]Okay.
[88:31.06]Where is this going?
[88:31.96]This is like just unbelievably good.
[88:33.80]Go right here.
[88:38.64]Yeah.
[88:38.92]That's game over right now.
[88:46.62]Goodbye.
[88:47.90]What's that?
[88:51.98]Dag nabbit my mule.
[88:56.84]Thank you.
[88:57.22]Okay, what do I got?
[89:04.71]Um, I think I can win pretty easily here.
[89:07.15]Hold on.
[89:12.39]Elk is... Alpha is... Okay, wait.
[89:15.76]I can do alpha.
[89:18.00]No, I have to put it right here.
[89:19.08]I could do...
[89:23.92]Ant?
[89:24.10]Do I have any ants?
[89:26.47]Ant queen is... Okay.
[89:28.51]Here's the deal.
[89:32.31]Uh... Elk is kind of sick too, though, isn't it?
[89:36.17]I think I'm gonna do elk.
[89:40.35]Oh, no, wait, no, no.
[89:40.93]This gives ants.
[89:42.31]Uh, right here?
[89:45.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[89:46.05]What's this do?
[89:48.61]Okay.
[89:49.31]We're good.
[89:55.35]Alright, that's good.
[89:57.71]About to win again.
[90:00.39]Alright, I just win the game.
[90:11.50]Bingo.
[90:15.86]There it is.
[90:16.24]Alright, first boss done.
[90:23.95]Allow me to light your candles once more.
[90:25.65]I won't be killing you quite yet.
[90:28.71]Very nice.
[90:29.15]Very nice.
[90:35.11]You're the first in a while to overcome a boss.
[90:38.15]As a reward, you are granted an opportunity to select a rare card.
[90:43.29]Choose carefully.
[90:48.88]Strange larva.
[90:58.85]The level of brutish strength needs no explanation.
[91:03.21]Seven?
[91:04.51]Seven and what?
[91:08.11]And Gek.
[91:10.16]The uninspiring Gek, perhaps you can find a use for it.
[91:19.12]Um... This doesn't cost anything.
[91:28.69]I feel like these are bait because this is free.
[91:32.59]It does one damage and I can sacrifice it whenever I want.
[91:42.49]What does this turn into?
[91:43.33]Probably some kind of big bug or something, right?
[91:51.36]Taking the gig.
[91:53.14]This is a free card.
[91:54.44]Huge early game.
[91:57.66]With sound of the prospector's pickaxe still ringing in your ears, you carried onwards.
[92:10.49]The rank smell of rot and mold permeated the humid air.
[92:15.51]Every step forward was answered by some nearby slip or slither.
[92:18.11]Tread cautiously into the wetlands.
[92:22.67]Set a card.
[92:26.52]Barber's nice, but Gek is cool, dude.
[92:28.52]Yeah.
[92:31.64]River Snapper.
[92:33.82]Adder.
[92:35.36]Warren.
[92:35.70]Spawns a rabbit when it is played.
[92:45.78]0-1 rabbit.
[92:46.57]This is kind of an annoying card.
[92:53.57]So this is a 0-2, and it gives you a 0-1.
[92:58.12]Hmm.
[92:59.00]That's kind of annoying.
[93:03.69]I think it's the adder.
[93:05.45]I would take the adder.
[93:06.85]In case you run into a huge enemy or something.
[93:08.51]I don't know what that is.
[93:11.43]What is this?
[93:11.81]I think this means I'm deleting a card for some reason, right?
[93:17.39]What does the pack do again?
[93:18.55]What's the backpack do?
[93:22.77]I clicked on this once.
[93:23.61]I forget what it was.
[93:25.99]Items.
[93:27.85]I guess I want to see what this is, so I'm going to click it, right?
[93:33.65]I don't know what this is.
[93:34.41]Uh, some familiar stones, but there was something different.
[93:44.51]You intuated that the fate of the creature selected for this would not be pleasant.
[93:53.18]I delete a card.
[93:56.74]Do what you must.
[93:58.64]Nope.
[93:58.86]What's the worst card that I have?
[94:03.76]I mean, the rabbit.
[94:14.56]I have just like a shitty rabbit belt.
[94:20.62]No elp.
[94:23.04]I would probably get... I don't know.
[94:26.58]Bullfrog kind of sucks, but it only eats one sacrifice, though.
[94:29.56]I feel like I'm going to need these later.
[94:33.74]I'm doing Bullfrog.
[94:35.58]I don't know what this does.
[94:40.68]Slaughtered the Bullfrog.
[94:43.36]However, the Bone Lord was pleased by your sacrifice.
[94:50.55]A minor boon of the Bone Lord, you will start each battle with one extra bone.
[94:58.41]Oh.
[95:00.65]That's kind of a big deal.
[95:01.39]Kind of, at least, right?
[95:07.16]Worth it, yeah.
[95:16.29]What does this mean?
[95:17.09]Alright, let me go down here again.
[95:42.56]How many ants do I have?
[95:57.96]I gotta move one person here.
[95:59.21]Come on.
[96:23.50]I'm so close.
[96:30.90]There it is.
[96:34.10]Caged wolf.
[96:36.54]There's another one of these over here.
[96:37.66]I don't want to hit that.
[96:47.67]I can't.
[96:47.95]Okay, so I have to hit this one.
[96:58.36]Three.
[97:13.22]Got it.
[97:14.56]What is that?
[97:15.64]Without having met her, this wood carving is meaningless.
[97:19.33]In time, you will understand its power.
[97:21.21]And there's a squirrel right here.
[97:28.21]Oh, it's just like Hearthstone!
[97:29.25]What does that mean?
[97:48.46]That didn't work.
[97:52.47]Still didn't do the clock yet.
[97:58.58]Is there another thing?
[97:59.24]Oh, no, I did.
[98:00.08]No, I didn't.
[98:03.62]Is something listed here?
[98:04.42]I don't know.
[98:18.22]Oh.
[98:18.54]Hammer?
[98:19.60]Staff?
[98:25.94]Ooh, teeth!
[98:27.40]Okay, I got some teeth.
[98:34.91]Is there anything else I can do?
[98:41.83]Okay.
[98:42.75]I got another card.
[98:47.16]Oh.
[98:47.40]I don't think I can do anything about that.
[98:52.40]I got another card.
[98:54.62]What about the candles?
[98:56.13]Oh.
[98:57.49]Okay.
[99:02.13]Okay.
[99:10.66]But you get a stump and you get a frog.
[99:12.32]Okay.
[99:16.38]I'm doing Ant Queen.
[99:17.20]Uh, yeah.
[99:21.09]I'm gonna wait till Ant Queen.
[99:21.91]Alright, I don't want this to get killed, so Ant Queen's going over here.
[99:41.10]Oh, perfect.
[99:42.37]Alright.
[99:44.71]I'm gonna put this down here in just a moment.
[99:47.25]It's fine.
[99:54.71]It's fine.
[99:56.60]Alright, I want a squirrel.
[100:02.04]Alright, so let me see here.
[100:06.64]Uh...
[100:10.40]That here.
[100:10.98]Worker ant here.
[100:14.36]Perfect.
[100:15.94]Very perfect.
[100:18.96]Very perfect.
[100:20.68]Very good.
[100:24.35]What?
[100:27.03]Excess damage is not wasted.
[100:28.63]It carries over to the card behind the mangled corpse of the victim.
[100:32.11]So that was cool.
[100:32.63]I didn't even know that.
[100:33.85]Lucky for you.
[100:34.33]Alright, what do we got on the board?
[100:40.71]Adder, bullfrog, I don't care about the bullfrog.
[100:45.53]Although I could put the adder out here.
[100:46.77]That's what we're doing.
[100:47.93]Oh, I need two.
[100:55.57]Shit.
[101:00.29]Probably should have read that.
[101:04.85]Oh, whatever.
[101:07.14]Uh...
[101:10.42]I'll go here.
[101:15.80]Oh, I thought I won.
[101:17.54]Fuck!
[101:18.94]I think I win anyways.
[101:22.85]I think I win anyways.
[101:32.53]I keep fucking doing this!
[101:34.99]I win.
[101:51.23]I keep fucking doing that.
[101:52.41]I keep forgetting this is two.
[101:57.12]I should still be fine, though.
[102:03.14]Okay, now... Let's go like this.
[102:16.99]Go.
[102:27.96]I'm so close to winning.
[102:28.82]Just win already.
[102:29.44]I'm not going to lose.
[102:38.07]I'm not going to lose.
[102:41.03]I have to pee.
[102:43.13]Alright, I'm going to pee soon here.
[102:48.04]River Otter.
[102:49.50]Elusive Otter.
[102:50.26]It submerges itself during my turn.
[102:55.15]A beehive will draw a bee when it gets attacked.
[103:00.25]Or Kaminsky.
[103:06.23]When an opposing creature is placed opposite to an empty space, a card bearing the sigil will move to that empty space.
[103:12.52]Let me read that again.
[103:19.30]When somebody on the other team is placed in an empty space...
[103:26.73]Opposite an empty space.
[103:29.81]This card will move to that space.
[103:35.56]And it's like a thorns.
[103:37.76]Okay, I get it.
[103:41.04]That's a good card.
[103:45.77]Submerged itself during its opponent's turn.
[103:47.59]While submerged, opposing creatures attack its owner.
[103:49.67]Guys, this is just like stealth.
[103:52.09]That's not bad either.
[103:56.52]This is cool, too, though.
[103:57.60]I could buff this at a campfire.
[103:59.20]I think I'm gonna do the beehive.
[104:01.86]Daughter is unkillable.
[104:03.76]Um... They all suck.
[104:10.40]I would probably... I'm gonna do beehive.
[104:12.74]You need to go piss.
[104:13.56]I will in a second.
[104:14.38]I'm busy.
[104:16.36]Alright, now I'm gonna buff the beehive.
[104:21.76]This might be health.
[104:22.74]If it's health, then that's big.
[104:26.91]Or I could sacrifice somebody.
[104:28.81]Maybe I'll sacrifice somebody.
[104:29.79]I'm gonna sacrifice somebody.
[104:41.11]Alright, what do I want to sacrifice?
[104:45.84]Oh man, beehive.
[104:48.86]Beehive on somebody.
[104:51.36]Go piss.
[104:53.12]Why are you saying go piss, girl?
[104:55.72]What?
[104:57.30]Alright.
[104:58.29]I think I'm doing Beehive.
[105:00.87]Yep.
[105:01.47]And I'm gonna give that to the Ant Queen?
[105:07.03]No.
[105:07.87]Somebody that I can... It has to be somebody that can stay alive.
[105:11.76]Ooh, Cage Wolf.
[105:15.74]That's just 6 health.
[105:16.46]What is it?
[105:18.14]Okay, this is kind of interesting.
[105:20.04]It'll just spawn a bunch of shit.
[105:26.92]It's got to be something with at least a few health.
[105:31.15]Maybe the cat?
[105:37.31]Skink too, right?
[105:42.21]I'm going to say probably this.
[105:46.17]Because that will just spawn bees over and over again.
[105:49.16]If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea.
[105:50.28]Whatever.
[105:52.48]It has a ton of health.
[106:06.02]Bullfrog.
[106:09.82]Rabbit pelt.
[106:10.70]Squirrel.
[106:11.58]Okay.
[106:18.48]I'll put the... Let's go here.
[106:25.65]And I'm going to put the pelt down right here.
[106:28.37]Because why not?
[106:35.64]Oh, I... Oops.
[106:40.32]Ant Queen.
[106:40.74]Did I even sacrifice two things?
[106:43.96]Shit, that was stupid.
[106:48.69]Yeah, that was just... That was just bogus of me.
[106:51.25]I don't know why I did that.
[106:52.49]But it's alright.
[106:52.99]I can just go another turn.
[106:55.51]It's fine.
[106:59.81]I actually want you to clear this shit out.
[107:01.61]I don't want it... Uh-oh.
[107:06.19]Oh, that was a... That was a big problem.
[107:09.83]That was actually really bad.
[107:14.65]Uh... I think I have to do this.
[107:25.38]Oh my god, I'm fucking dead.
[107:33.26]I'm gonna die right now.
[107:36.96]I blew it so bad.
[107:42.72]This'll be two... Alright, hold on.
[107:47.57]I'll kill this.
[107:48.33]Okay, if I get an ant out here, it'll be two, two.
[107:53.79]Which, it'll kill this.
[107:54.87]It'll kill the thing behind it.
[107:55.81]Shit.
[108:01.48]I think I really blew it.
[108:04.39]I could put the pelt down here or something.
[108:14.75]Or should I kill this row?
[108:21.16]What row is more dangerous?
[108:23.68]What row is more dangerous?
[108:32.78]Probably this one.
[108:35.41]Actually, I don't know.
[108:36.29]They're both kind of the same.
[108:41.23]The spider is like... Was that loud?
[108:43.71]And then I'll put the pelt over here.
[109:00.57]Right?
[109:00.83]I hope that's right.
[109:12.75]You scared me?
[109:16.59]Like there's a bug in the room.
[109:18.65]Well, I don't know if you were watching, I clearly gave at least two or three seconds of like a, oh, I'm about to yell because there's a spider.
[109:24.63]Alright, I got to put something down here so that I don't die.
[109:32.26]This is going to get killed, right?
[109:33.56]Or do I not care?
[109:34.26]Because I'll get some weight.
[109:36.32]Yeah, I'll be fine.
[109:36.78]I'll be fine.
[109:40.63]That's fine.
[109:42.09]Okay, now.
[109:47.19]You piece of shit.
[109:50.99]I don't think I need this yet.
[110:05.22]Because, hold on.
[110:08.84]This'll do two, four... Will I beat it?
[110:11.78]Will I kill him if I take a tooth out?
[110:13.18]This is risky.
[110:18.84]I think this is gonna kill him, right?
[110:24.69]And then that's four.
[110:26.21]That should be it.
[110:32.43]Just to be safe, I'm gonna... I think that's it.
[110:35.25]I think I did it.
[110:48.82]Rattler.
[110:50.72]Reginald.
[110:52.94]Tragic Rat King.
[110:54.30]When their tangled bodies become corpses, you will gain four bones.
[111:04.61]I don't get it.
[111:08.53]What?
[111:09.35]Four bones instead of... Oh, okay.
[111:11.32]So I just get... I feel like I need more bone cards, though.
[111:15.24]I have tons of bones.
[111:21.95]You know what to do.
[111:24.19]I can't spend the bones.
[111:32.23]This is huge too.
[111:42.52]When a card bearing the sigil damages another creature, the creature perishes.
[111:46.84]That's pretty huge.
[111:52.75]MonkaW.
[111:57.37]That's pretty big.
[111:57.87]Yeah, I'll take it.
[111:59.31]Should I get an item?
[112:06.03]I'm gonna get an item.
[112:11.42]Both pliers.
[112:22.79]So that means they can't be targeted or something?
[112:27.07]This seems kind of cool.
[112:29.88]The creatures will attack as though they have the airborne... Oh.
[112:33.02]That's amazing.
[112:34.82]I want that.
[112:40.15]Bleeding yields three blood if you can ignore the bleeding.
[112:44.85]What?
[112:47.13]Wait, what's happening?
[112:48.59]Oh.
[112:48.71]What?
[112:54.93]But what though?
[112:58.55]Black goat is created in your hand.
[112:59.95]A black goat is defined as zero power, one health.
[113:04.57]Worthy of sacrifice.
[113:10.38]It counts as three?
[113:13.38]It gives three blood.
[113:14.82]Oh.
[113:16.86]Okay.
[113:19.91]Okay.
[113:22.69]Okay.
[113:27.98]There we go, there we go!
[113:29.47]So this is gonna spawn bees.
[113:37.11]Airborne and... It submerges.
[113:40.39]So this thing's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[113:47.23]Okay, so this thing's a fa- this thing I'm never gonna get rid of.
[113:48.98]Uh, so I'm gonna deal with these two.
[113:52.80]Oh, scream cause it's a spider!
[114:06.72]How much health do you have?
[114:07.70]Alright.
[114:12.48]Keep me alive.
[114:13.32]I'll try.
[114:13.64]And dude, you know what?
[114:21.52]Let's put a, uh... No.
[114:27.46]Okay.
[114:36.88]Okay.
[114:37.70]Okay.
[114:45.36]None of these are gonna... Okay.
[114:55.76]I'm in trouble.
[114:56.36]Please go pee.
[114:57.13]I'm not gonna... Use the goat?
[115:00.65]I'm still confused on what this means.
[115:03.87]It costs one blood, but...
[115:08.38]I'm confused at what the point is.
[115:11.48]When this thing dies, what happens?
[115:14.16]Goad is better than wolf.
[115:15.25]Use it and find out.
[115:19.21]It gives... It's worth three for a sacrifice.
[115:30.45]I don't get it.
[115:33.03]Cost one gives three.
[115:36.29]What?
[115:40.15]Um... So I get to play... Okay, whatever.
[115:44.73]I'm kind of confused.
[115:47.07]Um... Holy shit, Jeremy.
[115:51.15]Hold on.
[115:52.27]Sacrificing it is like sacrificing three cards.
[116:00.18]So... Is there like an indicator of how many I've sacrificed so far?
[116:03.90]So I can play... So if I put this goat down...
[116:09.00]If I need three blood, I just eat that, and it counts as three blood.
[116:15.74]It's worth three... Okay, it's the cost.
[116:17.88]Yeah, alright.
[116:18.58]That's what I thought it was.
[116:22.34]I could just put this down and put this down, too.
[116:23.92]Actually, I don't really know what the hell to do right now.
[116:34.81]I don't think I want to use that now, though.
[116:36.23]I feel like that's like a boss thing.
[116:43.86]I'm just gonna do this, and whatever happens, happens here.
[116:45.80]Because, like, I kind of am screwed here.
[116:48.26]This is probably a bad idea.
[116:49.22]It is such a bad idea.
[116:51.06]This is a really bad idea.
[116:56.12]But, who cares?
[116:57.10]I'm full of bad ideas.
[116:58.40]This is a terrible idea.
[116:59.34]This is literally the worst move I could possibly do.
[117:01.23]I think I just lost.
[117:22.48]Fuck.
[117:26.11]Um... I don't know what to do.
[117:33.37]Let the wolf die?
[117:34.17]Yeah, I'm just gonna farm, but... I think I'm dead next turn.
[117:40.04]I'm just, like, dead next turn.
[117:50.55]I fucked up this whole round.
[117:51.67]I think I just lose.
[117:55.71]Because this can't... Alright, so this card can never die.
[118:07.28]Right?
[118:07.76]This can literally not be killed no matter what.
[118:16.04]Correct.
[118:17.32]I can cut this card and get rid of it.
[118:20.44]So I will live if I put... But this goes over the bee.
[118:26.11]Let's... Is this bad to do?
[118:28.07]Let's just do it.
[118:29.33]Okay, so that's gone.
[118:30.81]This can't attack.
[118:31.57]This is going to do one damage regardless.
[118:33.67]This is going to hit the... Alright, so let's do this.
[118:39.95]Let's just put this down.
[118:42.26]Like here.
[118:45.10]And... Oh my god, my brain.
[118:48.38]I just don't... I can't.
[118:51.40]Will this bit block it?
[118:52.94]Because I need to tip the scales, otherwise I'm going to lose.
[118:56.88]T-Brain?
[118:59.18]Well, I mean, if I don't tip the scales, I'm going to fucking lose, right?
[119:06.08]Chat, what are you talking about?
[119:12.87]Because if I take one more damage, I think I'm dead.
[119:18.23]I think that's what's happening here.
[119:21.72]Right?
[119:22.18]Like, I kind of had to do that, didn't I?
[119:23.97]Alright.
[119:29.77]Run saved.
[119:32.87]I can sacrifice the squirrel and the bee, kill both these motherfuckers over here.
[119:37.01]I don't want to screw this up, though.
[119:44.78]Let me get this right.
[119:55.59]Because this is... Oh, I hate this.
[119:59.61]I have to kill... This is going to die next turn.
[120:04.91]Do I wait until next turn to play me?
[120:08.53]I just put the bee down.
[120:13.09]Because then I'll kill this.
[120:17.39]I'll put the bee down here and just... Or let... I can't... I sacrifice this and kill this row.
[120:26.84]This is the one that's gonna kill me, though.
[120:28.56]I don't know.
[120:29.96]I have no idea.
[120:30.86]I'm just gonna fucking go for it.
[120:31.84]I have no idea.
[120:32.64]Like, I don't play these kind of games.
[120:33.82]I don't play Hearthstone in bed every night.
[120:35.48]I do every night.
[120:36.20]I have like 2,000 hours in Battlegrounds.
[120:38.70]Alright, I'm gonna put the bee down.
[120:42.14]No, I'm not.
[120:43.58]I just need to stop talking and just focus.
[121:01.77]Oh my god, what do I do?
[121:02.87]I'm fine.
[121:03.99]Did I just lose?
[121:11.00]What was that?
[121:11.48]I didn't want you to do that.
[121:15.32]What the fuck was that?
[121:16.00]I didn't want you to do that.
[121:20.32]What?
[121:22.26]That kind of blew everything, didn't it?
[121:23.20]Alright, I'm going to kill this row here.
[121:45.18]Please be right.
[121:46.74]Please be right.
[121:48.08]I think this is right.
[121:48.90]Okay.
[121:49.52]Okay, I'm good.
[122:11.52]Okay, I'm good.
[122:13.22]I got it.
[122:19.60]I'm good.
[122:20.74]Easy.
[122:22.12]I'm just gonna- I'm just gonna just fucking look.
[122:24.15]Pay attention.
[122:26.77]It's like, here, like, a voice over here, and a thing over here, and a- No, you go that way, go- sure, but go- and I'm just like, no, no, no, everyone- everybody stop talking and let's- let's go.
[122:35.36]I got 18,000 people in my head.
[122:37.94]And they're all you!
[122:46.89]Alright, kinda cool.
[122:49.02]Another beehive.
[122:52.08]I need bone consumption.
[122:57.72]I need bone consumption.
[123:01.41]Alright, I'm gonna set the boss.
[123:08.73]I can't, I don't even have, I can't do items.
[123:16.61]What do I want to put in here?
[123:25.86]I mean, I could just get that on somebody.
[123:31.32]Or I could do this, and then... Ant Queen, maybe?
[123:46.65]What about the Gak?
[123:52.13]Holy shit.
[123:54.34]And I can play that for free.
[123:56.74]You suck at strats.
[123:57.64]I know.
[123:58.66]Oh, I know.
[123:59.30]Trust me.
[123:59.60]Alright, I gotta pee.
[124:01.64]I'll be right back.
[124:02.74]Pee time.
[124:03.16]BRB.
[124:03.60]One second.
[124:03.90]See you in two... Well, maybe like a minute or two.
[124:11.37]I'll keep this music on too.
[124:12.25]It's interesting.
[130:10.59]Oh.
[130:12.15]I see.
[130:14.75]Got minimized.
[130:15.33]Oops.
[130:24.76]Okay.
[130:25.58]Let's continue.
[130:30.94]Let's get the shit out of you.
[130:31.90]What?
[130:35.91]Sorry.
[130:36.95]Why is the music not on?
[130:38.55]That's kind of weird.
[130:41.64]Oh, it's because I hit the Windows key.
[130:44.04]That's right.
[130:44.44]Oops.
[130:46.98]Hi.
[130:48.60]Alright, so this is a boss.
[130:50.54]Let's go.
[130:55.20]Only get one chance.
[130:58.56]Bow smell invaded your nostrils and caused your throat to seize.
[131:01.98]A hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water.
[131:11.24]He pulled a hook from a pile of rotting fish and rose to his feet.
[131:16.95]I am the Angler.
[131:18.03]Go fish.
[131:25.69]The Angler.
[131:26.75]Mind his hook.
[131:28.04]Play a swirl or something when he aims it.
[131:31.42]It will protect your best cards.
[131:42.27]Okay.
[131:46.84]He's not gonna be happy about this one.
[131:48.54]Alright, everybody quiet!
[131:51.36]Everybody silent!
[131:54.84]Okay, here we go.
[132:03.21]Let's play.
[132:03.99]Bingo.
[132:04.47]Squirrel.
[132:05.61]No.
[132:06.97]Smoke.
[132:07.43]No.
[132:09.29]Squirrel.
[132:10.69]Squirrel going out.
[132:16.86]Stink bug.
[132:17.30]Coming out too.
[132:19.88]Oh, he did it wrong.
[132:21.51]He did it wrong.
[132:22.13]He did it wrong.
[132:22.67]He did it wrong.
[132:23.25]He did it wrong.
[132:23.79]Whatever.
[132:30.13]Which fish hard choose?
[132:35.65]What?
[132:39.03]What's that mean?
[132:47.15]Can I put something on top of this?
[132:48.26]I don't get it.
[132:55.96]I don't get it.
[132:59.26]Whirl.
[133:00.32]He's saying he's going to take this card?
[133:02.38]What do I do about this?
[133:13.06]Pressure fish.
[133:13.82]Easy choose.
[133:16.64]Oh, okay, I get it.
[133:23.61]Oh, shit!
[133:24.31]No, I thought- I didn't know he moved again!
[133:26.03]I didn't know he moved it again!
[133:27.95]Alright, I thought he just decided!
[133:30.82]Oh, okay, but what is he gonna do about that?
[133:32.98]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[133:35.28]Oh, now I'm in a lot of trouble.
[133:36.90]Okay, I messed it up.
[133:38.54]Wait, no, I didn't.
[133:39.22]Yeah, I didn't.
[133:39.74]Whatever.
[133:50.60]I didn't... Okay, I get it.
[133:55.04]I get it.
[133:55.82]I get it.
[133:56.24]I get it.
[134:13.08]That was good.
[134:13.64]That's not a bad move.
[134:14.94]Decent play.
[134:16.18]Really?
[134:16.46]Alright, so if I do...
[134:20.39]Gecko's not good here, though.
[134:21.51]Maybe it is.
[134:22.41]Because it'll kill that.
[134:32.38]Because if it kills that, he gets the bones.
[134:34.36]And then this won't attack me.
[134:36.90]And then I go like this.
[134:39.04]And then I say, let's go!
[134:40.18]We're good.
[134:45.10]Stale fish.
[134:45.64]Hard choice.
[134:53.50]Um, wait.
[135:02.89]Because he's gonna take that.
[135:09.83]If I play a card, he takes it.
[135:12.82]So... I don't really care if he takes this, because...
[135:19.52]I could... Well, he'll take the pelt.
[135:21.38]Alright.
[135:21.56]Let me see how dumb this is.
[135:24.59]If I go boom boom, and then I put the pelt down... Okay, that's what I'm doing.
[135:30.81]Fuck it, let's go.
[135:35.06]Fuck it, I'm going.
[135:50.63]Go ahead, take them.
[135:51.15]I don't give a shit.
[135:57.41]Oh, wait.
[135:57.77]Does it shuffle the board?
[135:59.11]It does.
[136:00.87]Okay, go fish.
[136:06.02]He just gets a free turn.
[136:08.14]I will use this opportunity to pull a scout and end my turn.
[136:13.14]Oh my god, what just happened?
[136:21.39]What?
[136:23.56]What the hell is that?
[136:25.34]Okay, this is bad.
[136:36.35]I need bones.
[136:40.15]That's bad.
[136:41.33]Not good.
[136:51.97]Four.
[136:52.31]Five.
[136:54.34]I don't think that's enough.
[136:59.98]Is it enough?
[137:05.76]If I sacrifice a squirrel and do the fan, is that enough?
[137:13.12]That's enough?
[137:14.18]Sacrifice.
[137:14.72]Huh?
[137:17.70]Enough.
[137:18.34]Wait, hold on.
[137:18.92]Everyone relax.
[137:20.60]Sacrifice Jerma.
[137:24.37]Yeah!
[137:26.29]What happened?
[137:30.68]Wait, does this come back?
[137:32.20]No!
[137:32.58]No, no, no, this doesn't work like that.
[137:36.42]What do you mean?
[137:38.14]Do you use... Hold on.
[137:40.47]Yes.
[137:41.43]I hope you guys aren't lying to me!
[137:56.53]What?
[137:57.69]Did I do it?
[138:01.25]Ended the fan now.
[138:02.61]Ended four of five.
[138:04.34]Is that enough?
[138:06.02]Just end your turn.
[138:07.04]What?
[138:07.18]Are they gonna hit shit?
[138:08.68]You win!
[138:09.30]You win!
[138:09.72]You win!
[138:10.16]You win!
[138:15.20]What?!
[138:16.12]Oh my god!
[138:16.86]I thought... Okay.
[138:23.49]The reason why I freaked out is because I thought he was gonna hit this for some reason.
[138:27.75]Relight your candles.
[138:28.62]Thank you.
[138:30.18]I thought he was going to hit that.
[138:31.04]Okay.
[138:31.76]Didn't even need to use the fan.
[138:33.44]Okay.
[138:40.46]Okay, we're good.
[138:45.11]Another larva.
[138:46.93]This thing.
[138:48.83]I held 13.
[138:54.94]Doesn't die when sacrificed, but you have the heart to try.
[139:04.25]So it just stays on the board forever?
[139:14.05]I feel like... I kind of already have a couple of these, don't I?
[139:20.68]In a way.
[139:21.76]I'll take the larva.
[139:22.70]Why not?
[139:28.98]Okay.
[139:29.14]Okay.
[139:30.52]Dinner would have to wait.
[139:34.49]Let me see.
[139:34.91]A frigid gust of wind billowed unwelcome into your lungs.
[139:43.65]The beauty of the falling snow failed to distract you from the chill in your bones.
[139:49.40]You had ascended to the snow line.
[139:50.86]What else you got in your fucked up little room here?
[140:26.32]Finally pried my special dagger from the paws of that squirrel, though you may wish that you hadn't.
[140:30.39]Okay.
[140:47.95]What can I do with that?
[140:58.43]I have an item now.
[141:03.41]Look at the smoke.
[141:06.23]You have the knife.
[141:07.35]Okay, yeah.
[141:11.34]What is it?
[141:11.70]Can I use it on the... Do I have to sit down?
[141:17.78]That one's only for card dueling.
[141:29.49]You encountered a small outpost in the woods tended by a mysterious woman.
[141:34.03]It was the traitor that the old trapper had mentioned.
[141:39.37]Her appearance was unsettling, but you were mollified by her offering.
[141:43.46]Do you mind if I examine those pelts of yours?
[141:50.63]Start with your hair pelts.
[141:52.35]Here's what I can offer.
[141:55.83]Wait, what?
[141:57.74]I can trade you any of these.
[141:59.32]Take your time.
[142:04.66]Egg pie.
[142:09.38]You may search your deck for any card and take it into your hand when you play this.
[142:14.60]That seems really good.
[142:17.51]Ringworm.
[142:20.86]This thing kind of sucks.
[142:23.92]What does this thing do?
[142:24.58]This thing's terrible.
[142:26.65]I think I want the coyote because I have things that generate bones.
[142:32.41]I have barely any bone spenders.
[142:35.51]This thing doesn't even have a description.
[142:45.49]Magpie.
[142:46.01]Yeah, magpie's good too.
[142:47.03]I don't have any bone spenders.
[142:54.23]I have all these things generating bones, but they just sit on the table.
[142:57.33]Okay, the last, like, three or four games, I had, like, four, five, six bones just sitting there.
[143:04.42]Taking it.
[143:08.18]I'm thinking about taking Mantis just so I can sacrifice it and give it to somebody else.
[143:11.88]That's what I'm doing.
[143:15.42]Is that a golden pelt?
[143:16.66]Magnificent.
[143:18.42]God.
[143:22.99]Amalgam?
[143:30.15]Chime is created on each empty adjacent space.
[143:32.35]Chime is defined as 0.
[143:33.57]So when you put it down to 0, 1.
[143:37.03]Oh man.
[143:45.11]So this just kind of gets in the way.
[143:48.57]Or.
[143:48.79]It's just a random card.
[143:57.58]Oh, this is just like a tank.
[144:04.54]I'll take the tank.
[144:16.09]What the hell is this?
[144:26.28]Who's that?
[144:32.79]The choice is yours.
[144:33.45]Who is this?
[144:36.27]It's me.
[144:38.69]Okay, so I'm going to give this spreading move.
[144:46.36]Will this kill everything?
[144:48.80]This will kill two things, right?
[144:56.54]That's kind of a big deal.
[144:59.34]Yeah.
[145:00.54]That's a huge deal.
[145:03.10]That's three bones, too.
[145:04.04]Perfect.
[145:09.26]I don't know what this is.
[145:09.88]We haven't seen it yet.
[145:10.36]What?
[145:22.32]Hefty.
[145:30.31]Creatures in the way get pushed.
[145:36.61]That's kind of scary.
[145:37.27]So this is going to move forward.
[145:41.62]So I should try... I got to get... How many bones do I have?
[145:43.68]I only have one bone.
[145:45.70]That'll be two.
[145:47.28]If I put Reginald here, when they come down, it'll kill them both.
[145:58.54]Alright.
[145:58.90]I need to think about this.
[146:05.44]So, let's just put something out there.
[146:06.58]We'll put the skink here.
[146:08.42]Right?
[146:09.26]Yeah.
[146:10.18]Right?
[146:10.40]Because that's stupid.
[146:16.17]I think that's a... Yeah.
[146:16.95]Because then... That's a bone.
[146:22.45]And then... It's two bones.
[146:30.62]I can't do anything else, really.
[146:32.48]So, we're just going to go...
[146:41.24]So that's your three.
[146:43.80]Unfortunately, I will kill these two.
[146:47.08]Let's go ahead and get that out of the way.
[146:48.62]Let me draw first.
[146:49.52]Alright, Reginald's going here.
[146:51.74]That'll kill both of these.
[146:57.91]And I need to put something over here.
[146:59.19]No, I can just wait.
[147:04.37]What does a knife do?
[147:07.35]You will place a weight on the scales.
[147:09.73]Pain is temporary.
[147:10.71]Okay, so that would be like, boink, boink.
[147:19.54]I got to draw something, right?
[147:22.34]Good.
[147:25.70]That's kind of bad, isn't it?
[147:40.68]It's me.
[147:41.12]Okay, hi.
[147:45.19]You're really kind of screwing this up.
[147:48.65]Oh, I think I just win.
[147:50.49]Yeah, I just win.
[147:55.44]It's not a bad play.
[147:56.26]I just win right now.
[147:59.62]Hey, what?
[148:01.36]Hey, what are you talking about?
[148:03.32]Oh, it gets in the way of... Right, okay, whatever.
[148:14.18]I win.
[148:14.80]Right now.
[148:15.88]Because... That'll be... It's fucking zero.
[148:25.72]It's gonna go... I'm just gonna sacrifice these guys.
[148:28.51]No, I'm not.
[148:29.61]I'll win next turn.
[148:30.27]Who cares?
[148:30.63]Yeah, I'll win this turn.
[148:37.29]Yeah, good for you.
[148:44.60]What is happening right now?
[149:15.69]I might be able to do this.
[149:18.87]If I go boom boom and go this way, it might be a victory already, right?
[149:25.82]I think that's a win if I do that.
[149:35.16]That's one, two.
[149:41.24]Then I can do two.
[149:43.16]Two.
[149:46.07]Which would go here.
[149:51.72]And then, hey!
[149:52.48]I think I just won.
[150:09.33]Yeah, I didn't.
[150:15.65]Nah, I win.
[150:16.05]The game's over.
[150:16.63]I win.
[150:16.85]The game's over.
[150:17.31]I win.
[150:18.31]I win.
[150:18.55]The game's over.
[150:21.95]The game's over.
[150:22.33]I win.
[150:24.79]It's fine.
[150:25.31]Whatever.
[150:31.87]What's this?
[150:32.23]I have the most exquisite pelts.
[150:38.35]Oh.
[150:39.33]I got a lot of teeth.
[150:44.52]First one's free.
[150:51.55]Don't buy more.
[150:54.07]Yeah, isn't this going to just kind of load up my deck with a bunch of shit?
[150:58.91]Maybe just buy this one?
[150:59.65]I feel like this is going to load my deck up with a bunch of crap.
[151:07.82]I'm going to buy the gold one and that's it.
[151:09.90]Then I'm done.
[151:22.43]Alright, I'm going to sacrifice him.
[151:27.10]Mole Man?
[151:35.88]Or Larva?
[151:42.27]Mole has two effects.
[151:43.11]Yeah, I don't know.
[151:44.21]I feel like this would be cool, though.
[151:52.65]Mole Man can make somebody crazy.
[152:00.21]That one's good, too.
[152:03.79]Yeah, this one's good.
[152:04.87]Because then I can put it on... So it would not hit whoever it was, and they would move out of the way.
[152:15.21]Okay.
[152:15.96]Maybe the Mole Man.
[152:18.70]Or Larva.
[152:20.42]Yeah, that's a good one.
[152:22.93]Because then this will absolutely live one turn and then transform.
[152:30.50]Sounds good.
[152:35.90]I'm starting to get it a little more.
[152:37.66]Games like this are really kind of nerve-wracking for me.
[152:40.40]Alright, you go to Mole Man.
[152:48.75]So this pushes in a direction.
[152:50.25]This one will always be a tank.
[152:53.13]So... I can't... That was the scream at the bug joke.
[153:04.13]I wonder if I... If I even do anything?
[153:06.09]Or just skip?
[153:06.53]I think I'm just gonna skip or something.
[153:13.00]Yeah, because if I put this down... I feel like he's just gonna die.
[153:16.74]Like, immediately.
[153:21.98]And I guess I'm just going to do this.
[153:23.18]Whatever.
[153:23.58]Let's go.
[153:31.70]Ow.
[153:36.36]That hurts a lot.
[153:39.76]Again with this shit draw.
[153:44.19]Oh my god.
[153:44.81]I'm going to kill this.
[153:50.47]And I'll get three...
[153:54.34]If he's gonna kill this anyways, then why not just be able to put something out?
[153:58.30]Right?
[153:59.40]Use the knife?
[154:00.38]I could.
[154:00.72]Alright, hold on.
[154:02.46]If he's gonna kill this anyways, why not just me kill it?
[154:07.26]Be able to play the coyote next turn.
[154:10.52]Because he's gonna kill the ant instead.
[154:13.62]Or wait till the queen comes up.
[154:18.98]I thought I had a lot of bo- Yeah, I thought I did too.
[154:20.80]I thought I had a lot of bone makers.
[154:26.92]I'm gonna... Whatever.
[154:28.02]If I lose, I lose.
[154:29.34]I'm gonna see what happens if I do this.
[154:32.23]Like, this could be stupid, but I'm gonna try it.
[154:35.43]I got the four.
[154:43.75]Okay.
[154:46.35]Now, let's pull this.
[154:47.57]Okay, so now I got two, one.
[154:52.89]It's gonna bounce off this anyways, so I'm gonna have to put a pelt down.
[154:57.16]Belt down here.
[154:57.80]Coyote.
[155:01.73]It doesn't really matter where the coyote goes, right?
[155:05.03]So, whatever.
[155:06.51]I'm in trouble, but what am I going to do about it?
[155:11.18]What the fuck was that?
[155:13.48]Oh my god.
[155:16.81]Uh-uh.
[155:35.78]I'm, like, gonna die.
[155:38.46]I think I might have to open this.
[155:45.62]What does a knife do?
[155:46.16]Uh... Okay.
[156:08.18]I can't do anything else, so, um... Cool.
[156:13.95]I'm so fucked!
[156:14.77]What am I supposed to do about this?
[156:16.21]That's why he had so much such an advantage!
[156:20.49]I'm just dead!
[156:21.37]I'm gonna lose!
[156:22.01]I... He started... I started... All the bones.
[156:25.96]Fucking ruined this run.
[156:29.62]What did I say?
[156:30.72]Oh, hey!
[156:31.10]I didn't buy it!
[156:31.86]Get a bunch of bones!
[156:32.78]Because I have so many bones... Uh... Creators...
[156:37.65]I had like... I'm just dead.
[156:42.81]It's over.
[156:43.27]I lose.
[156:45.27]What am I going to do here besides this?
[156:46.61]I mean, I could just sit here and get killed.
[156:50.91]I'm not going to... This is over.
[156:52.56]I mean, might as well just open this and see what it does.
[156:59.14]So I put this down.
[157:02.56]This is worth... Wait.
[157:06.44]Hold on.
[157:09.49]So if I do this, I get three blood.
[157:11.99]You have two lives.
[157:14.85]Oh my goodness.
[157:15.69]I do?
[157:16.79]Right.
[157:16.99]It's only for bosses when he blows out the candle.
[157:19.37]Okay.
[157:23.62]So what should I do here?
[157:27.70]Kill the squirrel with this.
[157:28.72]Put down the queen.
[157:32.02]Or kill the coyote.
[157:32.98]I don't know.
[157:43.80]Goat, queen, rattler.
[157:48.73]Okay, so if I sacrifice the squirrel, then it's fine, right?
[157:52.01]Because I'm still kind of confused how this works.
[157:53.47]So I'll get three.
[157:58.35]So put that down.
[158:01.65]This is now... I can put this down here.
[158:04.35]So I sacrifice this.
[158:08.97]And then that lets me put this...
[158:14.50]I don't want this to die immediately, but I'm gonna fuckin' put the ant down.
[158:21.26]Um.
[158:24.44]I don't know.
[158:30.85]Squirrel to queen to ant.
[158:33.35]Bones.
[158:34.63]Um.
[158:37.43]Did I not draw a card yet?
[158:39.62]I did.
[158:41.98]So should I kill the coyote?
[158:48.80]Like, all this... Okay, I actually have no idea what's going on.
[158:53.12]I... I'm just fucking dead anyways.
[158:55.10]Like, I just lose anyways.
[158:59.00]Like, I'm not gonna do anything about it.
[159:00.56]I'll blow a candle out.
[159:01.46]Not disappointing.
[159:08.30]Believe it or not, you're not the first to lose an eye here.
[159:10.14]It's not much fun if you're half blind.
[159:12.63]You'd like to replace it, perhaps.
[159:20.38]Oh, I wanted to see what it looked like.
[159:21.74]I didn't get a chance to look at it.
[159:26.37]Choice is final, okay.
[159:30.17]Wait, I get to keep going.
[159:31.51]Wait, hold on a minute.
[159:38.60]I definitely don't want this.
[159:39.76]I'm a goat.
[159:52.20]So, it doesn't store it, though.
[159:56.00]So, if I put this down and I use something that costs two blood, it's not like I get to keep the other one blood in reserve.
[160:03.13]It just, like, up to three.
[160:08.65]So, I have... Okay, I understand.
[160:10.77]I get it.
[160:12.56]So, you would only want to use this if you had something that had at least two or more.
[160:17.04]I get it.
[160:17.48]I get it.
[160:17.98]I understand.
[160:18.38]What does this do?
[160:24.33]This one's kind of interesting.
[160:25.59]This is way too many bones.
[160:26.65]I need to get something.
[160:27.63]I need to get something that's not... I might actually just take this.
[160:33.35]Or this is... I need damage.
[160:38.29]My deck kind of sucks.
[160:48.23]Go for it.
[160:53.07]I'm going here.
[160:56.89]I don't get it!
[160:57.59]Okay, so this is health.
[161:04.04]Please, no.
[161:06.80]Larva?
[161:11.48]Oh, man.
[161:12.76]1-3 with poison?
[161:13.70]4?
[161:16.68]Reginald?
[161:18.30]1-3 with poison is pretty ridiculous.
[161:23.14]Uh-huh.
[161:35.44]And it's free.
[161:36.56]I would love to see it.
[161:37.42]Let me see it right now.
[161:41.52]Alright, this is not a bad start.
[161:48.58]Do you not have anything?
[161:49.16]Okay, what do you got?
[161:50.56]Perky?
[161:53.93]Okay.
[161:59.91]And this is this annoying thing.
[162:01.41]Alright, so I'm okay.
[162:03.88]I'm gonna put out me next turn.
[162:06.82]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[162:07.64]We'll put Mole Man out right now.
[162:08.86]Let's go.
[162:10.98]Mole Man?
[162:13.96]Or... Do I just wait till next turn?
[162:19.40]I think it's too late now.
[162:20.99]It is.
[162:24.32]Nope.
[163:12.93]Ah!
[163:14.17]I died.
[163:14.80]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[163:15.68]What happened?
[163:24.88]What ha- I don't know what I fucking did.
[163:30.55]I thought, I think I die anyways.
[163:34.97]Even if I didn't sacrifice the mole man.
[163:38.15]Yeah, yeah, stay there.
[163:39.29]No need to move.
[163:40.24]I'm afraid you are not dead yet.
[163:41.96]Yeah, hold still.
[163:44.74]Where did I put that camera of mine?
[163:46.12]Stop taking pictures of me.
[163:48.14]You don't have 30 HP.
[163:49.84]This isn't Hearthstone.
[163:59.34]I know, but still, man.
[164:00.54]Did I take a picture?
[164:03.80]Wait, did I just take a picture of this guy?
[164:04.90]Do you really think I would leave film in there?
[164:10.05]Do you have any idea what that camera is capable of?
[164:13.31]Give me that.
[164:16.91]We have a memento to create.
[164:20.93]Behold your... Oh, I do a new one every turn.
[164:29.57]Oh no, I had a good one last time.
[164:35.07]Cost?
[164:35.55]This is free.
[164:42.87]Power and health.
[164:46.49]In the Rattler.
[164:49.52]Free one.
[164:53.30]Sigils.
[164:59.53]I feel like the wolf is better.
[165:19.74]Good Riddler.
[165:20.94]That's such a stupid fine.
[165:25.08]One thing remains.
[165:25.82]It must capture your photo or whatever.
[165:31.00]Jeez.
[165:45.11]Oh, Ray just came in.
[165:46.41]What?
[165:46.87]Hold on a minute.
[165:47.37]I gotta correct this.
[165:48.83]This is like white.
[165:50.53]The light is white.
[165:51.43]I need to change that.
[165:52.09]That's why I look like a fucking skeleton today.
[165:54.63]Hold on.
[166:12.50]Big raid?
[166:12.84]We have a big raid.
[166:19.47]Lanya Lazar.
[166:21.07]Lazar.
[166:22.05]I fucking said that so wrong.
[166:35.27]I'm so sorry.
[166:38.29]Oh my god.
[166:38.89]That's so fucking embarrassing and stupid.
[166:42.61]Thank you so much for the raid.
[166:43.61]Welcome, everybody.
[166:47.53]I look like such a fucking dickhead right now.
[166:51.55]Thank you so much for the raid.
[166:52.53]Welcome, everybody.
[166:52.95]It's a big raid.
[167:00.09]Yeah, if you don't know Lon, it's VTuber.
[167:04.36]I've seen.
[167:05.50]I've watched.
[167:05.84]You don't think I don't know who that is?
[167:07.86]You don't think I don't know?
[167:11.16]Now it's time for an apology.
[167:19.37]Here's the thing.
[167:19.75]Let me explain.
[167:20.45]I'm so sorry.
[167:21.69]I looked over here and I just... My brain just immediately started reading.
[167:26.44]And it's like... I looked over and it says... I'm such a fucking dumbass.
[167:35.92]My brain has trouble sometimes, but I do appreciate it.
[167:39.34]Thanks.
[167:39.54]Welcome, everybody.
[167:40.00]We're playing... We're playing Inscription.
[167:44.92]Apology song.
[167:45.70]I'm not singing an apology song to anybody.
[167:48.21]No.
[167:49.09]No apology song.
[168:01.23]I can see the music.
[168:11.21]Okay.
[168:12.83]You will learn as we go.
[168:15.71]Or you will die.
[168:18.34]Hope you had a good stream, though.
[168:19.72]Thank you.
[168:22.12]You see, he was defeated recently and wishes to redeem himself.
[168:25.88]Earwax in your eyes.
[168:27.24]My ears are clean.
[168:28.33]Relax.
[168:34.20]It would be unfortunate if you were to fall to the prospector before he was given that chance.
[168:38.92]This hook is powerful.
[168:39.76]You may steal one of my cards with it.
[168:41.36]For that reason, you will not find any others along the path.
[168:46.98]Use it wisely.
[168:47.69]It seems the lowly stink bug has made its way in.
[168:55.29]But it is dealt, so it stands.
[168:56.73]What's happening to everybody?
[168:59.19]Are they all messed up?
[169:05.56]What?
[169:05.80]What happened?
[169:06.12]Did I get to pick one?
[169:14.86]Yeah, why is his head turning into a square?
[169:23.29]This is my deck right now.
[169:25.25]Ah, I see.
[169:26.65]So let me guess.
[169:27.91]So I beat two bosses.
[169:29.98]So the game is like, okay, you beat two bosses.
[169:31.86]So we're just going to get you on the path to the last one you beat before the area you were just in.
[169:35.60]Is that how that works?
[169:38.62]So I have to beat the angler again.
[169:42.67]No.
[169:49.67]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[169:56.47]No, you may not choose a specific beast.
[169:58.77]Instead, you must now decide on a tribe that you prefer.
[170:01.73]Huh?
[170:10.08]I'm going to go with insects.
[170:22.19]A randomly chosen insect card.
[170:23.75]Do you wish for something else?
[170:26.89]No.
[170:27.63]I'm going with insects.
[170:30.93]This game is crazy.
[170:33.89]The rules are kind of changing.
[170:35.90]Okay.
[170:44.52]Choose.
[170:50.87]What am I choosing?
[170:54.41]What am I choosing?
[171:00.09]This is for the cockroach card, which would be, this would be unkillable.
[171:04.41]Okay.
[171:05.03]Huh?
[171:31.74]If you lose this run, you are fucked.
[171:35.97]I'm probably gonna, man.
[171:38.85]Oh!
[171:40.83]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[171:43.81]Is this what that looked like?
[171:54.05]This is what that looked like.
[172:02.38]Holy shit.
[172:12.23]Looks like Dr. Robotnik.
[172:17.15]Somebody put a mustache right here.
[172:19.95]Somebody put a mustache right there.
[172:30.27]That's fucked.
[172:42.78]Jesus.
[172:47.60]Hey!
[172:51.08]Alright, so this thing... What does this do again?
[172:54.57]What happened?
[172:57.15]So this can't die?
[172:58.07]So I can just sacrifice a hundred times?
[173:03.11]Hold on, let me test this.
[173:04.03]So if I do Bullfrog on this... Okay, what?
[173:19.33]Really?
[173:19.59]Oh, okay.
[173:22.55]How do I get rid of them?
[173:29.18]But if it can't die, then... Okay.
[173:30.46]Alright, dude.
[173:38.36]Relax here.
[173:38.92]What the fuck?
[173:40.62]Um... Alright, I gotta do this.
[173:53.62]Yeah, and then... Stink bug.
[173:56.32]Let me save the stink bug.
[174:00.44]Because I'll put that out after this.
[174:04.13]He sucks.
[174:06.47]Dude, I don't... I don't know, man.
[174:08.93]Like, I'm just trying to play the game.
[174:10.57]I suck asshole at card games.
[174:12.93]Seriously, did you watch me play Hearthstone?
[174:16.60]Did you watch me play Hearthstone?
[174:18.48]I just sometimes just put cards down because they look pretty.
[174:21.16]They look nice.
[174:22.40]I don't know.
[174:23.04]I have math in my head.
[174:24.28]I'm doing fine.
[174:39.41]I'm doing fine.
[174:40.39]I'm fine.
[174:40.79]I'm fine.
[174:41.13]I'm fine.
[174:46.80]Hold on this place.
[174:47.62]Shut up!
[175:05.47]Again, I have to pick another... Alright, so I'm doing insect again.
[175:08.83]Because it's an insect build.
[175:09.91]The ant.
[175:15.71]Okay, cool.
[175:23.66]I got a lot of teeth.
[175:25.73]Okay.
[175:27.71]Gently shake a hand.
[175:28.39]She placed her offerings before you.
[175:30.05]Another offering?
[175:31.21]Uh, what's... I don't know.
[175:37.59]What am I picking here?
[175:38.20]Okay.
[175:39.02]What does the snake head do?
[175:41.28]I didn't want to pick the snake head.
[175:42.54]I just wanted to see what it did.
[175:43.36]I don't know.
[175:45.18]I don't know what I just did.
[175:46.48]What just happened?
[175:50.41]What happened?
[175:52.69]I don't know what just happened.
[175:53.45]I wanted to look.
[175:59.00]What do I do?
[175:59.44]How do I fix this?
[176:06.24]Um... Keep the squirrel head?
[176:08.34]I don't understand what's happening.
[176:12.62]So... Click the squirrel head.
[176:17.32]Press S. Keep squirrel.
[176:19.50]Does this mean I'm keeping the squirrel right here?
[176:21.54]Or does this mean I'm keeping the squirrel?
[176:28.39]Click the squirrel.
[176:29.73]Now click this.
[176:30.29]Okay.
[176:34.87]I thought I could look at that.
[176:36.99]No.
[176:37.67]Dude.
[176:38.17]Okay.
[176:39.11]I wanted to read it.
[176:40.37]I thought I could read to see what it was going to do.
[176:44.71]I...
[176:50.53]I just wanted to read it.
[176:51.17]It's like a snake head.
[176:52.37]I didn't know what that did.
[176:55.13]It's for lizards.
[176:56.17]Right click to see it.
[176:57.03]I didn't have a book on it.
[176:57.83]Alright, what do you got?
[177:02.96]Okay.
[177:04.90]So it's going to go forward and then this way.
[177:07.68]I don't want anything right here, right?
[177:09.16]I want it like here.
[177:12.25]Well, that was a fucking dumb thing that I just did.
[177:13.83]I literally just said don't put it there.
[177:20.49]Thank you.
[178:04.91]Hold on.
[178:05.93]Bro, please.
[178:06.75]What?
[178:16.94]We got a good one.
[178:27.11]Okay.
[178:45.71]This looks like I have boogers coming out of my nose.
[178:54.82]This one's good but I'm not bald.
[179:17.24]Nosebleed.
[179:22.40]Uh, Mantis.
[179:39.31]Two health.
[179:39.77]So...
[179:47.86]Choose wisely.
[179:48.56]The ant?
[179:56.60]Or the wolf, probably.
[179:57.52]This would be good.
[179:58.72]This would be 3, 4.
[179:59.14]The mantis?
[179:59.84]1, 4?
[180:02.68]Huh.
[180:18.89]Cockroach would be interesting, because it would just all wait.
[180:21.31]But yeah, I think this would kind of get in the way, wouldn't it?
[180:23.61]This would last too long, I think.
[180:33.40]Before bones, I'm not bone generating.
[180:36.73]Put it on the mantis.
[180:51.34]What's this shit?
[180:51.80]Alright, there's two birds.
[181:01.56]Uh, I think I'm gonna get... Get this out of here first.
[181:11.32]Oh shit, I need to... Okay.
[181:19.03]You don't get tokens for that, huh?
[181:44.55]you back on the board yep okay oh wolf alright ah who do I want to get rid of you because you'll kill this whole row
[182:11.57]And that's good.
[182:11.99]Okay.
[182:18.41]That should be good to go.
[182:24.50]Should be good to go, right?
[182:26.14]Three... That'll kill... That won't kill this, but... I think we're good.
[182:35.34]Don't raid it again.
[182:36.52]I'm not going to raid it again.
[182:40.31]Ooh, Mantis.
[182:41.37]Mantis in replace of the ant.
[182:44.21]It's just a better ant.
[182:46.97]Yeah.
[182:48.35]I mean, it's just a better ant.
[182:51.02]It'll hit.
[182:51.34]Yeah, let's do it.
[182:56.20]I wish I could get rid of this.
[182:57.12]Alright, game over.
[183:07.35]Let's see if I can do a ton of damage, though.
[183:11.50]Cockroach?
[183:12.06]Nah.
[183:15.58]Nah, that's it.
[183:20.12]That's a lot of gold.
[183:31.14]Elk Fawn, Original Dagen, and a River Snapper.
[183:34.54]I mean, we have to take... We have to.
[183:40.80]And then we just sacrifice.
[183:41.64]We're putting Reginald up to sacrifice now, right?
[183:48.69]Because I'm not generating very much bone.
[183:56.47]Boy, that would be huge, too.
[183:59.63]Cockroach or Reginald?
[184:00.56]Which one?
[184:12.51]Who do I want to give that to?
[184:15.27]I mean, probably Mantis or probably Reginald.
[184:21.54]Or maybe the Mantis.
[184:26.72]Wolf is good.
[184:27.38]That's just very clean though.
[184:34.22]Very clean.
[184:46.81]Ant.
[184:47.01]I don't have a queen ant, though.
[184:50.41]I'm going mantis.
[184:53.97]I don't have a queen ant.
[184:58.53]Okay, so this is the angler again, right?
[185:12.73]Hold on.
[185:15.46]I have to play the whole game over again when I lose.
[185:17.18]Alright.
[185:36.88]It's a roguelike.
[185:38.78]Just pop that mule.
[185:39.98]Yep.
[185:41.76]I know what I'm doing.
[185:44.50]Alright, let's go.
[185:46.52]Squirrel going out.
[185:51.78]You boom.
[185:57.08]You boom.
[186:14.69]Bullfrog.
[186:20.69]Stop.
[186:22.43]Stay.
[186:28.13]Okay, now.
[186:32.59]I get four bones when this is broken.
[186:37.68]There we are.
[186:38.52]There we are.
[186:39.04]Check this out.
[186:42.71]We go one, two.
[186:45.05]Smack that.
[186:47.92]We go one, two.
[186:49.96]Smack into that.
[186:52.50]We go.
[186:55.54]Let's see if I care.
[186:56.22]I don't care.
[186:59.93]Mantis.
[187:00.45]Good.
[187:01.37]Mantis is going to go... I kind of wish I could get rid of this.
[187:11.74]I wish I could delete the boulder.
[187:14.82]Just don't.
[187:19.78]Just leave.
[187:20.20]Because he's going to kill everything.
[187:23.96]Yep.
[187:24.14]Okay.
[187:25.02]This is jump, no?
[187:43.70]I can't do anything because this is just stuff on the way, so whatever.
[187:47.58]Just kill it, please?
[187:51.02]Alright, now.
[187:51.66]Ooh!
[188:01.35]Perfect.
[188:01.63]Go ahead and kill that, please.
[188:09.87]Um... Please hit that.
[188:12.29]I can't play anything.
[188:17.19]I can't play anything.
[188:23.65]Just hit me.
[188:28.97]Thank you.
[188:31.75]I can't play a squirrel otherwise I have too many squirrels.
[188:35.97]I can't do anything still.
[188:38.06]I could do this.
[188:44.74]What am I going to do with all these?
[188:53.60]Alright.
[188:55.16]Um... No.
[189:08.65]Use them as tanks?
[189:09.63]I could just do that.
[189:14.92]Okay, I'm pretty much about to... Yeah, it's over.
[189:18.60]Cool.
[189:24.75]Nice.
[189:25.87]Okay.
[189:28.87]How many levels are in the game?
[189:31.07]Like, how many areas?
[189:32.53]How many bosses are in the game?
[189:38.52]There's 20?
[189:44.64]How do you, like... There's four.
[189:48.60]It's complicated.
[189:50.52]Don't ask that question.
[189:51.74]Okay.
[189:52.39]Okay.
[189:56.70]Prudent pack rat never dealt the utility of a well-stocked pack.
[190:04.40]When a card bearing this is played, you will receive a random item as long as your pack is not full.
[190:10.14]That seems broken.
[190:28.53]I just get an item every time I play the card.
[190:29.97]Okay, this is the last one I'm going to show.
[190:35.22]This is the last one I'm going to show.
[190:37.14]I'm not showing any more.
[190:39.62]Let's be very clear.
[190:40.48]This is the last one that we're going to show.
[190:42.24]No more after this one.
[191:13.79]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[191:15.33]Okay.
[191:25.14]Let me think.
[191:28.70]The air grew thick with... Alright, this is the Angler.
[191:34.81]Wetlands.
[191:37.31]What's this?
[191:44.39]Inky black mouth of a cave.
[191:46.15]Strange beast lurked within.
[191:52.40]Spoke past one of my... Did anybody have one I did that like two years ago?
[191:56.94]The clip of the... It's the funniest movie of the year.
[192:02.24]That was a joke we did, right?
[192:04.29]Anybody have that clip?
[192:04.93]Yeah, because it was like a Bernie Sanders political ad, right?
[192:15.32]Nobody cared enough?
[192:16.32]I thought that was a great one.
[192:21.59]Pass one of my trials and I will be yours in a raspy voice.
[192:30.08]Freak creatures will be drawn from your deck.
[192:31.50]They will decide your success or failure.
[192:38.14]But first you will choose a trial.
[192:41.84]Trial of Bones.
[192:42.60]The three drawn cards must cost at least five bones combined to pass.
[192:49.87]Three drawn cards must have at least six health combined to pass.
[192:54.93]Or at least three sigils among them to pass.
[193:02.58]We got it right here?
[193:07.26]Ernie approves this message.
[193:09.38]Funniest movie of the year.
[193:10.32]Is this it?
[193:12.63]Yeah, that was pretty funny.
[193:14.23]I thought that was funny.
[193:42.21]What's wrong with that?
[193:42.89]Alright.
[193:49.18]Uh, it's probably health.
[193:57.16]I'm gonna say health.
[193:58.04]Or sigils.
[193:58.79]Don't I have like five?
[194:03.77]Every single one of my cards has a sigil, doesn't it?
[194:05.31]I think it's... I'm doing this one.
[194:11.87]I did it twice?
[194:13.96]How many times did I do that?
[194:15.68]Hold on, there's a different one?
[194:16.82]The funniest movie of the year.
[194:21.98]Half-Life Alyx, it's the funniest movie of the year.
[194:28.73]That's not the same.
[194:29.55]Critics are saying it's the best VR game of 2020.
[194:33.75]I've done that, whatever, it's a funny routine.
[194:37.35]Half-Life Alyx, we didn't beat you.
[194:40.85]That's a funny routine.
[194:41.63]I don't care.
[194:42.69]I think I'll do it again too.
[194:47.31]Got it.
[194:51.58]So what do I- what do I get for this?
[195:01.66]Um... Okay.
[195:09.57]This is, what is this?
[195:10.61]I'm gonna carve this, so I get four bones when this dies, and it's got quills.
[195:17.53]This is underwater, so it's like stealth.
[195:20.41]That's actually kind of amazing, but eight bones, oh, that's way too much.
[195:24.83]Or, copies comes back when it dies, and it has, eh, that one's not that great.
[195:29.31]I pick one of these two.
[195:30.58]Probably this one.
[195:34.56]Eight bones?
[195:35.14]When am I ever gonna have eight bones?
[195:36.72]I'm gonna pick this one.
[195:47.40]Hmm.
[195:48.42]The amount of items you can carry is three, and you have three.
[195:50.84]He said perhaps you'll accept this gift from my friend.
[195:58.73]Another pack rat?
[196:00.75]Alright.
[196:01.05]Alright.
[196:04.77]That's looking pretty good.
[196:06.59]I got two of these.
[196:08.95]Dude, you fell off.
[196:09.63]You were using old jokes.
[196:10.79]I didn't... I just was remembering an old one.
[196:13.19]Let's go.
[196:18.65]Okay, so this is... So, I might as well just use something, right?
[196:24.43]Because if I get an item, I might as well use something.
[196:32.66]What does this one do again?
[196:33.46]No, I want... Book one of my cards and take it as your own.
[196:40.12]I'm not going to use the knife.
[196:46.48]That's probably gonna come in handy later.
[196:47.70]I don't think I'm gonna use that.
[196:48.79]The knife?
[196:49.37]The squir- Probably the squirrel, because what the fuck?
[196:51.31]Who cares?
[196:53.15]I have so many infinite squirrels.
[196:55.15]Yeah.
[196:55.61]What am I gonna do with that?
[196:56.43]Here you go.
[196:56.85]Now let's play... Now check this out.
[196:59.38]Ready?
[197:00.36]Watch this.
[197:00.64]Is this something fucking crazy?
[197:03.12]I'll show you right now.
[197:04.14]Bingo.
[197:07.08]Done.
[197:07.65]Flyers.
[197:08.49]Done.
[197:15.61]That's fine.
[197:15.99]I want you to kill it anyways.
[197:26.29]One, three.
[197:31.42]This spot, you sure?
[197:32.10]Yeah.
[197:32.32]Don't question me.
[197:39.34]Oops.
[197:45.37]This is okay.
[197:46.19]This is fine.
[197:46.61]This is fine.
[197:50.79]This is fine.
[197:53.59]I'll kill that.
[197:54.93]Okay, now it's alright.
[197:56.71]That'll die.
[197:57.19]This won't get killed next turn.
[198:00.39]And then... Oh, I just went.
[198:13.16]Oh, I just went.
[198:14.28]In a minute.
[198:16.70]Should I just rip a tooth out and just get another?
[198:18.60]Um, I think I fucked it up.
[198:20.30]Okay.
[198:28.33]Uh... I think I just have to go.
[198:36.35]Alright, how can I kill now?
[198:47.94]Stink bug is 1, 2.
[198:49.54]I will kill that.
[198:52.38]Hack rat.
[198:56.96]I really want that stump to die.
[198:59.98]Oh, there we go.
[199:00.38]Okay, game over.
[199:01.76]But, should I... I'm gonna get an item first.
[199:05.86]Oh, who cares.
[199:06.38]Just fucking win.
[199:08.42]Yeah, who gives a shit?
[199:11.48]Who gives a shit, right?
[199:12.70]Yeah, who gives a shit?
[199:14.30]Wait, who gives a shit, right?
[199:17.69]Who gives a shit?
[199:18.15]I win.
[199:18.33]I don't want a bullfrog.
[199:32.60]I don't know if I want that.
[199:34.54]Ooh, I'll take this one.
[199:39.10]Mushroom land?
[199:44.86]Thick and pungent mushrooms.
[199:47.54]You squint to see a figure through a thick cloud of spores.
[199:51.50]We are the... My-so-logists.
[199:55.22]Yes.
[199:56.80]Yes.
[199:58.21]And we are performing our experiments far from... We are not welcome elsewhere.
[200:05.69]We will experiment on your flock, yes?
[200:07.83]We will need two of the same creature.
[200:09.37]I have two pack rats.
[200:19.51]Okay.
[200:25.06]This could get messy.
[200:26.34]Look away.
[200:31.78]Oh, that's pretty huge.
[200:35.02]That's a big deal.
[200:39.41]I'll take it.
[200:41.69]Does the sigil stack?
[200:42.61]That would be amazing if it did.
[200:43.71]I don't know.
[200:48.86]we've got b these are gonna fly over me so it doesn't matter uh I'll put the u over uh here and then we'll go blink and uh doesn't really matter so we'll go blank we'll go from here it's fine
[201:28.46]Alright.
[201:39.33]Check this out.
[202:01.67]Uh, oops.
[202:09.54]Uh... Fuck.
[202:19.39]I think I screwed this up.
[202:20.17]I'm in a lot of trouble now.
[202:42.32]I need to do... I'm just so bad with, like, placement and, like, thinking two, three turns ahead in games like these.
[202:53.50]There's no car I can just drive into, like, a wall.
[202:55.54]You know what I mean?
[202:56.28]Like, I have trouble with these.
[203:04.10]Stink bug is gonna drop down.
[203:06.04]Put the stink bug here.
[203:09.20]Right?
[203:09.41]Because then this can't do anything.
[203:15.19]I might just be dead.
[203:15.93]I think I just lose.
[203:21.71]I'd have to use the knife, yeah.
[203:22.81]I have to.
[203:23.11]Okay.
[203:40.15]Now...
[203:43.75]This'll, uh, oh, I fucked it up.
[203:46.89]I, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[203:47.99]I just... I have so much trouble, like, thinking two or three turns ahead.
[204:00.46]And, like, I don't know.
[204:02.10]ADHD is just like, what do these do again?
[204:04.60]I don't remember.
[204:05.44]Alright.
[204:14.83]Okay, if I get hit one more time, it's over.
[204:22.37]That's too... Should I pull another squirrel?
[204:26.38]Hook something?
[204:29.60]There's just too many options for my brain to focus on.
[204:38.36]Use the rat?
[204:44.28]Yeah, but I just... I don't... Okay.
[204:46.89]I wish I could just, like, pull the camera out.
[204:48.67]You know what I mean?
[204:49.45]I wish I could see my hand and the board at the same time.
[204:52.99]Like... Okay.
[204:57.99]So... I wonder if I should... Okay, I gotta make a fucking play here.
[205:07.08]I can't just sit here.
[205:07.74]I can't just sit here and cycle menus.
[205:12.47]This is to, if I go bang... I'm gonna pull a squirrel.
[205:16.23]Fuck it, whatever.
[205:16.73]I'm gonna die anyways.
[205:17.45]Pull a squirrel.
[205:22.39]Bang, bang.
[205:23.39]That'll kill this whole row.
[205:27.77]And then, see what happens, I guess?
[205:34.94]Oh, shit!
[205:35.56]It went over.
[205:36.54]Right.
[205:37.22]Oh, fuck.
[205:37.62]It's in the trouble.
[205:42.20]What's this new item?
[205:42.88]I just want to look over there.
[205:47.76]I don't know what to do.
[206:00.66]I could fishing hook the... What should I fishing hook?
[206:03.28]The stump or the bee?
[206:12.43]Press D to look at items?
[206:13.53]I have four damage?
[206:19.16]Yeah, but is it gonna... Alright, let's go.
[206:33.83]Hmm... I don't think I do anything.
[206:47.80]I'm kind of screwed because I can't get rid of those squirrels.
[206:52.60]I could use this here.
[206:53.68]Alright, I'm going to try.
[206:55.06]I'm going to go for this.
[206:55.70]Alright, draw this.
[207:02.68]Alright, wolf.
[207:03.26]Three, two.
[207:03.78]Fuck, I can't remove this.
[207:09.60]Shit!
[207:33.34]I think that's going to do it.
[207:38.00]Yeah.
[207:42.81]Yeah, my brain just has so much trouble.
[207:44.31]This is why I never play games like this.
[207:47.75]Because it's like... I just get lost looking at the cards.
[207:54.25]And then I go, wait, I don't even know what to do.
[207:55.81]Let's take this one.
[208:02.95]Happy with that one.
[208:03.67]Find Salvation Cuckoo Clock.
[208:08.69]Didn't I already do the clock?
[208:16.88]I did the clock already.
[208:22.96]Bugs.
[208:24.04]Yeah.
[208:42.48]Take the film roll before he sees it.
[208:44.82]Now.
[208:45.04]What are you doing over there?
[208:51.29]He's self-gaslighting.
[208:53.01]No, I just... You give me a dodge roll and I'll fucking beat that game.
[208:58.89]Alright, I got film for the camera?
[209:00.76]So does that mean I can take a picture of him now?
[209:07.36]He's gaslighting himself.
[209:20.83]Go look around some more?
[209:26.07]One.
[209:29.38]What is this for?
[209:30.06]Oh my god, that was fucking weird.
[209:41.04]I did that.
[209:44.73]Is the eyes turning on doing anything?
[209:57.32]Does this mean anything too?
[210:12.73]Do the game board puzzles?
[210:14.71]I did all of them already.
[210:17.93]Yeah, I did them all.
[210:24.38]IOT?
[210:24.90]Because there was a card here before.
[210:26.60]I don't know what it was.
[210:27.30]Okay, keep going.
[210:37.15]I think I have full items.
[210:43.82]So let's go this way.
[210:50.53]Move with a certain vigor in spite of her considerable age.
[210:54.07]Yeah.
[210:55.33]I don't want to do anything about this, right?
[211:01.37]Keep the squirrel.
[211:03.77]Yeah, I don't really want to.
[211:05.97]I guess I could have gone to the backpack.
[211:10.15]Fix the squirrel.
[211:17.31]I'll keep the squirrel head, though.
[211:20.17]Is it bug build?
[211:23.99]I... The squirrel, I think, is fucking me up.
[211:29.57]I keep putting out too many, and then I just, like, I get, like, overwhelmed with what I need to do next turn.
[211:35.51]Maybe I should try the bug.
[211:41.95]You'll get used to it?
[211:43.55]Too many two-cost cards in your deck?
[211:46.51]Hmm.
[211:46.63]Hmm.
[211:52.79]I'll try.
[211:53.09]I'll keep it.
[211:54.07]Let me try the bug.
[211:55.47]I'm just curious what this does.
[212:00.17]I have like a ton.
[212:00.77]Yeah, I'm going to try it.
[212:01.57]I have a ton of bugs.
[212:03.25]Half my deck is bugs.
[212:04.15]Let me try it.
[212:11.06]I can always put it back on, right?
[212:19.26]I ought to thank you.
[212:21.38]How has it been?
[212:21.98]It has been... What is going on with this guy?
[212:24.16]I'm trapped.
[212:25.58]In the body of a stoat.
[212:27.64]In the paper of a card.
[212:30.19]I see that.
[212:30.75]And I have, of course, set up a way to reset once more.
[212:35.83]Go on.
[212:37.05]A player friend here.
[212:37.91]They already hold the key.
[212:43.58]What are they turning into?
[212:44.94]It's like a TV.
[212:48.66]TV.
[212:55.51]Okay, ants.
[212:56.27]Just gotta be careful.
[212:57.05]The number of ants is a problem.
[212:58.17]Let's go this way.
[213:02.64]What does this do?
[213:03.26]Just this is 2-2?
[213:08.50]This'll kill this if I... I'm gonna put it here.
[213:12.32]Here we are.
[213:12.74]Yeah, this would've killed it.
[213:18.58]So, I mean, I'm gonna get hurt, but... Oh, God.
[213:22.48]Maybe that was a bad idea.
[213:44.89]I gotta hook something.
[213:54.12]I think I have to, otherwise I'm just gonna lose right now.
[213:57.20]What should I pull?
[213:58.46]One of the ants?
[213:59.06]No.
[214:00.32]Skink, probably.
[214:06.43]Why'd everybody want me to do the ringworm?
[214:12.83]Doesn't work like this?
[214:14.31]It only pulls the front one.
[214:15.67]Oh.
[214:21.74]I'll take one of the ants.
[214:22.52]Because now this will live forever.
[214:32.14]Technically.
[214:34.14]So wait, I can sacrifice that now.
[214:37.63]Like this.
[214:39.83]Right?
[214:40.11]This is correct, right?
[214:42.39]Tell me I'm a good boy.
[214:43.15]Tell me I'm a good boy.
[214:44.03]Okay.
[215:01.13]Found the Stunted Wolf.
[215:02.47]I've seen this play out enough times to know that the plan is in motion.
[215:07.71]Make haste.
[215:10.62]Oh, you're a bug.
[215:11.78]Alright.
[215:13.88]Okay.
[215:16.08]This will clear all this.
[215:17.16]I think I just win.
[215:20.64]Pretty sure this is just a win right now.
[215:26.13]I think so.
[215:32.21]Is that right?
[215:33.59]Eh, one more.
[215:43.22]There it is.
[215:49.16]You're such a good boy.
[215:55.12]This was cool.
[215:55.81]I'll do this one again.
[216:02.86]Oh, you've been such a good boy this year.
[216:05.46]Everything has a sigil, right?
[216:06.52]So... Every card I have has a sigil.
[216:16.72]Your scare cam is blocking the text.
[216:20.64]What's a good place to put the camera, then?
[216:26.37]What?
[216:28.07]Oh, I passed.
[216:38.15]This is always three blood.
[216:42.66]Okay.
[216:47.74]Bat with beehive.
[216:51.64]This is never going to attack.
[216:57.18]This doesn't attack.
[217:00.88]It has no attack, right?
[217:04.76]These all stink.
[217:08.07]I would pick this one.
[217:08.77]Four bones.
[217:12.67]This one's not bad, but... It's a bad roll.
[217:20.46]So if this attacks, will it actually... Because these things don't attack, because it's not going to hurt anything.
[217:24.46]Does it actually just have to physically move?
[217:26.86]Or does it actually have to hurt something?
[217:30.18]You could sacrifice this one, yeah.
[217:34.12]I'll take it for the bugs.
[217:49.08]Oh, you can't use that.
[217:52.06]What the hell is this?
[217:58.00]What?
[218:01.25]This bottle of goo has no use.
[218:03.11]Okay.
[218:08.43]Alright.
[218:10.13]Angler time.
[218:10.63]Let's go.
[218:18.79]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[218:24.87]A huge man approached.
[218:28.13]Go fish.
[218:28.53]Okay.
[218:28.67]Do I just use it?
[218:41.08]I'm serious, you cannot use that.
[218:42.40]There is no possible use for it.
[218:44.78]I'll place it on that shelf over there for now.
[218:47.66]My advice, avoid it.
[219:07.01]oh it's
[220:10.01]Oh, shit.
[220:10.59]I'm an idiot.
[220:11.59]No!
[220:12.49]Oh, it fucking messed up.
[220:13.77]I can't play this game.
[220:20.23]I would have done whatever.
[220:21.81]Fuck!
[220:23.53]Shit!
[220:34.94]If I had gone this way, I would have had four teeth land.
[220:37.94]Ah, whatever.
[220:41.41]Alright, it'll do the damage fine.
[221:13.19]One, two, three, four.
[221:18.13]I can't really do anything.
[221:19.59]I can put a squirrel here.
[221:20.83]I think I just have to go, right?
[221:30.16]Oh, I can sacrifice that.
[221:31.44]I didn't think I could.
[221:32.06]I thought I had to get killed.
[221:35.90]Okay, I didn't know I could sacrifice it.
[221:37.08]I didn't think it was an actual... I thought sacrifice... This is so loud.
[221:40.48]I need to turn this down so I can even hear myself think.
[221:43.84]Um, I thought, I didn't think this was like a thing to sacrifice.
[221:46.95]Okay.
[221:48.87]So I'm going to put the adder over here.
[221:59.04]And that'll kill that.
[222:02.30]Alright, I'm back in business.
[222:10.67]Take this stupid squirrel.
[222:13.78]Come on.
[222:17.14]Thank God.
[222:21.42]He's pan- I'm not- I'm not panicking.
[222:23.07]I'm not panicking.
[222:23.69]I'm alright.
[222:26.77]I'll turn it up for you.
[222:27.51]I just don't wanna hear it.
[222:33.33]Okay.
[222:42.52]Alright.
[222:49.06]I'm kind of in trouble here.
[222:50.22]I should go put him here.
[223:21.86]Oh, where I... What the hell is in here?
[223:28.62]Okay, this is frozen away.
[223:37.80]Will this help me here?
[223:38.86]What does this do?
[223:44.58]Okay, so if I put that in front of one of these guys here...
[223:51.51]That'll block and then come back to life?
[223:56.12]Could I sacrifice this now?
[223:59.00]Would that be stupid?
[224:07.03]Alright, well.
[224:20.98]I don't know.
[224:24.67]I have to pull a tooth.
[224:27.81]Save your head on stream?
[224:29.15]Nah, I don't think so.
[224:29.91]Let's see what happens.
[224:36.19]Okay, now... Put the squirrel down.
[224:49.94]Sacrifice squirrel and the frozen thing.
[224:55.15]Right?
[224:56.05]And then I can use this and that'll kill it.
[225:02.04]Right?
[225:02.22]That's right.
[225:05.30]Wolf, then man.
[225:07.08]Yeah.
[225:11.38]Okay.
[225:12.60]So now I go squirrel, mantis.
[225:20.18]And then bang, I win.
[225:26.29]Does it matter where I put this guy?
[225:27.23]Right here?
[225:27.93]And then that's free.
[225:30.97]Do I need to use the fan?
[225:31.85]I think it'll just work, right?
[225:32.81]Do I have to use the fan?
[225:40.64]Fan.
[225:40.72]Yo, let's go!
[225:47.82]See, I just need, like, to look over and have you guys play the game for me, because I can't fucking do this.
[226:02.21]We're good!
[226:12.24]Ooh, we got a- we got a GECK!
[226:15.82]Always take the GECK, always, every time.
[226:25.90]This game's really fun.
[226:27.18]I think it's a good game.
[226:28.92]My brain just, okay, here's the thing.
[226:30.98]When I'm streaming, my brain is going in two different directions.
[226:37.69]This is the type of game that I would, like, be on the toilet and just be like... And each turn I could sit there for, like, fucking 15 minutes.
[226:48.98]If I sit here for 15 minutes and just go like this...
[226:53.74]Then, like, people are going to be like, what's wrong with his brain?
[226:56.44]Is he alright?
[226:59.26]What is he?
[226:59.82]Hello?
[227:00.40]Is he alive?
[227:01.14]What's he doing?
[227:01.72]Dude, why is it taking him so long?
[227:04.06]I would sit there like this.
[227:11.75]And I would, like, get up and eat a sandwich.
[227:14.19]Probably halfway through one of these terms.
[227:21.87]I think it's great.
[227:23.12]I love this.
[227:23.66]But when I'm streaming, like, it's... My brain is, like, operating in two different places.
[227:27.82]Okay.
[227:32.20]Alright, we're back in the snow.
[227:34.62]Let me at least beat this part.
[227:38.34]Oh, move the camera right.
[227:39.12]Sorry.
[227:44.71]We do a sweat check?
[227:48.63]No, it's, like, yellow under there.
[227:53.02]No, it's not.
[227:53.50]Shut up.
[227:54.80]It's not!
[227:55.36]I'm kidding!
[227:55.82]It's a joke.
[227:58.26]Actually, I'm sweating.
[228:01.67]I'm fucking kidding.
[228:02.67]It's not.
[228:03.11]Look.
[228:03.35]See?
[228:04.55]See?
[228:09.67]It's a joke.
[228:12.11]It's the light.
[228:12.67]I have a yellow light burning down on me.
[228:15.61]It's not!
[228:16.35]I have a yellow light right here.
[228:18.49]Look.
[228:20.83]You see?
[228:22.34]Look, it's yellow, right there.
[228:45.29]Yeah, this is like, is this on iPad?
[228:54.34]No?
[228:55.04]Oh, okay.
[228:59.30]This thing is ridiculous, so I'm taking this.
[229:09.59]It's coming to Switch soon?
[229:11.03]Oh, that's awesome.
[229:12.77]Alright, health.
[229:19.00]I mean... Nine health?
[229:35.13]Oh, I gotta let... Hold on.
[229:36.17]I gotta talk about what's going on tomorrow.
[229:40.51]Tomorrow, we are going... Just because a lot of people are here.
[229:44.79]Tomorrow, we are going to be playing Elden Ring PvP.
[229:50.96]Tomorrow is very important.
[229:52.80]I'm not even... The stream's not over yet.
[229:55.82]Elden Ring PvP.
[229:58.12]With the intention of finding my champions...
[230:03.80]Because Ludwig and I are doing a 1v1 community versus community trial by combat night.
[230:14.15]Look, he's got his own shit going.
[230:16.19]He's got his own community to worry about, right?
[230:18.82]He's going to find the community kind of champions there.
[230:22.44]I'm picking mine tomorrow.
[230:29.54]And we use Rivers of Blood.
[230:31.98]Now that's a good question.
[230:34.60]We're probably going to... We're probably going to... I would assume... Maybe we'll ban a few items?
[230:43.69]We'll find out.
[230:44.99]We have to have some rules.
[230:45.91]We're not sure what those rules are yet.
[230:48.71]What's the rune level?
[230:49.99]We'll figure that out in the next day or so.
[230:52.15]Let's have a ban list.
[230:56.22]But tomorrow we're going to mess around again.
[230:57.38]That was so much fun just doing PvP Invasion Night.
[230:59.60]I want to do it again.
[231:00.21]I had a lot of fun doing it.
[231:01.39]It was awesome.
[231:03.65]But the biggest intention tomorrow is to find who I want as my champions.
[231:08.77]For later on, probably this coming week.
[231:10.77]This weekend.
[231:13.09]I'm really tired and want to go to bed.
[231:14.99]I'm not going to go that long tonight.
[231:17.86]And if you want to know, am I going to play this again?
[231:19.56]Yeah.
[231:22.42]Yeah.
[231:24.30]Am I capable of playing this again?
[231:26.81]You think so?
[231:28.43]I really like it, but I have trouble.
[231:31.61]I have a lot of trouble.
[231:32.27]Maybe you guys can help me.
[231:35.33]Maybe you guys can help me play it.
[231:36.17]Alright, what do I want +2 health?
[231:45.24]I love the concept of this game.
[231:46.56]I love it.
[231:50.03]My brain is cross-eyed when I play a game like this.
[231:56.87]This really is a good game.
[231:58.23]No, I mean, it is.
[231:58.97]This is awesome.
[232:00.35]I love the art.
[232:00.87]I love the lore.
[232:01.75]I love the atmosphere.
[232:05.26]If you guys can help me.
[232:06.14]I don't care about that.
[232:07.58]Alright, who should... I was thinking Moosebuck.
[232:13.66]Or Gek.
[232:17.77]I'm sorry I'm so scatterbrained.
[232:19.11]I just... You know what I mean?
[232:21.69]My brain has so much trouble sitting here and doing this.
[232:26.16]So, if you came here looking for a... You know, like, oh, come on.
[232:32.34]Like, why the fuck can't you do this?
[232:34.18]I apologize.
[232:34.70]I'm sorry.
[232:35.40]I hope it's, like, fun.
[232:36.80]I'm having fun.
[232:37.42]I hope you're having fun.
[232:40.16]My brain just can't, like, focus.
[232:42.88]It's stupid.
[232:43.78]Okay, we're good.
[232:55.85]Okay.
[232:57.39]So what's the, what's the stipulation here?
[233:00.69]No worries.
[233:01.09]Okay, cool.
[233:06.19]Yeah.
[233:06.69]Ooh, right off the bat.
[233:14.52]Over on the right.
[233:15.94]What do you think?
[233:20.02]I know exactly how you feel.
[233:23.31]You're doing better than I did.
[233:24.88]Yeah, I know.
[233:25.90]Sometimes I'm concerned about just being an absolute idiot in the game.
[233:30.76]And people just sit there going like, dude, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[233:36.01]Okay.
[233:36.19]I'm going to say all the way to the right.
[233:47.85]And then a squirrel.
[233:51.84]And then we go.
[233:55.15]Is it your first try?
[233:57.11]Yeah, I know.
[233:57.43]I'm just having fun.
[233:58.27]I'm just having fun.
[233:58.83]I just really don't want people to think, um... Oh, do I really care about being, like, an idiot?
[234:04.60]I don't know.
[234:08.44]I literally, like, ate bubble soap two days ago.
[234:11.82]I'm concerned about looking stupid in a video game.
[234:14.37]Oh, really?
[234:15.33]Uh, what?
[234:22.38]Alright, here we go.
[234:23.44]I'm bringing out the, uh, I'm bringing out the moose.
[234:27.03]No, bringing out the wolf.
[234:34.85]Oh, shit.
[234:35.37]I don't know.
[234:35.87]Should I put the... I'm scared.
[234:43.95]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[234:50.76]Thankfully it moved over there though.
[234:51.86]Okay.
[234:55.12]Fuck that hurt.
[235:06.51]I need the moose.
[235:13.46]Do I live?
[235:13.94]If I don't, I think I live one more time.
[235:17.50]I don't know what to do.
[235:19.20]Grab another squirrel next turn.
[235:20.22]Oh, actually, this is okay.
[235:23.74]Okay, this is alright.
[235:24.66]This is not bad.
[235:28.84]So now I can sacrifice... Oh...
[235:53.95]I think I'm dead.
[235:57.31]Game over, Andy.
[236:01.12]Okay, well, whatever.
[236:02.20]Let's just... Eh, just kill me.
[236:05.22]I'd lose anyways.
[236:05.76]Do I live one more turn?
[236:07.18]No.
[236:08.64]Eh, I just lose.
[236:09.90]Whatever.
[236:20.59]I wanted to at least see the other boss, right?
[236:26.91]Do I even have any health?
[236:28.69]Oh, I know.
[236:29.17]Okay.
[236:29.39]That's it.
[236:35.05]I don't want any more.
[236:35.71]I'll look around the room.
[236:40.18]No, I have... I've done a lot of stuff I could do so far, right?
[236:44.06]Okay.
[236:52.73]Yeah, let's just... I did the clock.
[236:54.77]I did the little mini-games here.
[236:56.13]I did the sword, the dagger, right?
[236:59.27]I took that, and I did all that.
[237:00.49]Yeah, I did... Oh, wait a minute.
[237:02.65]There's the goo, right.
[237:05.26]Keep sealed.
[237:08.60]Pain is unbearable.
[237:11.06]Even after all these years, what do you want?
[237:13.02]I have very little to live for these days.
[237:17.82]B. You have the master's eye.
[237:19.98]Does this mean the master can see me?
[237:24.86]Magnificus, can you see me?
[237:27.09]Can you free me?
[237:27.85]It is done.
[237:30.61]Master is free.
[237:31.39]Well, the end must be close now.
[237:35.05]If Magnificus is free, it must be close.
[237:39.95]Watching the angler lose, now that soothed my pain.
[237:43.91]An old rival of mine, that fisherman.
[237:46.89]He bested me this time, but I will have another chance.
[237:51.33]Oh, I see you have a little something special up your sleeve.
[237:54.57]Fear not, I won't blow your cover.
[237:56.93]You just need to get a hold of that camera of his.
[238:00.34]Maybe if you defeated him, you would get a chance.
[238:06.02]So I have to like beat the game and then take a picture of him.
[238:11.46]Interesting.
[238:12.46]Okay.
[238:13.14]Interesting.
[238:20.75]Very interesting.
[238:22.71]I want more buffs.
[238:30.23]+2 health.
[238:32.05]Echo again.
[238:33.05]One, five.
[238:33.59]Four adder.
[238:46.90]Book.
[238:51.11]I'm going to do adder.
[238:51.63]I feel like that's very useful.
[239:01.53]Book.
[239:01.73]I already did it.
[239:29.44]I bite my lip and I don't want people to see.
[239:31.36]Bad habit.
[239:35.68]Alright.
[239:38.16]Stop!
[239:41.55]Squirrel, mantis.
[239:42.95]Seems like a good idea.
[239:50.53]And then bullfrog.
[239:51.59]Uh...
[240:05.86]Oh.
[240:06.00]Is that a stupid idea?
[240:17.62]Uh... Shit.
[240:26.26]Alright.
[240:26.82]Okay.
[240:27.32]I got it.
[240:27.74]Bingo.
[240:29.06]Porcupine.
[240:29.99]Going in.
[240:33.77]Um...
[240:36.94]Which will give me the bones to put out Regidal to kill this.
[240:43.67]I think.
[240:51.36]And this can go here.
[240:52.98]And then you will kill that.
[240:58.48]And then I will take one tooth worth of damage.
[241:07.48]now I kind of need to squirrel and then hit the pass button alright okay okay now oh that's too bad do I keep reginald there and just pass
[241:37.80]I think so.
[241:38.32]I think I'm alright.
[241:39.12]Okay.
[241:46.58]Alright, now that kills that.
[241:47.86]Let me take a look at the board.
[241:49.74]This kills this.
[241:52.38]This is gonna just hit that.
[241:54.28]There'll be another one of these coming down.
[241:56.88]Ooh, okay.
[242:00.72]Okay.
[242:03.29]This is going to swing.
[242:04.41]This is going to come down and hit and then go over here.
[242:07.49]So I'll put the adder here.
[242:09.19]Eventually.
[242:16.84]Okay.
[242:17.48]This kills that.
[242:19.94]This stays here.
[242:20.98]This is going to move down.
[242:22.62]I put the adder here, but I can't really do that yet.
[242:27.52]So I'm going to pass again.
[242:33.22]Confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm what they confirm.
[242:39.42]Adder kills rock.
[242:45.87]Okay.
[242:51.41]Now I got two squirrels.
[242:56.65]Adder, bang.
[243:00.74]Uh-huh.
[243:09.93]Bang.
[243:12.59]Bang.
[243:15.09]Good.
[243:17.93]Another squirrel.
[243:21.21]Good.
[243:23.29]Very nice.
[243:23.71]Because that was going to bounce over here.
[243:25.19]Okay, grab another squirrel.
[243:35.50]So a wolf will kill that.
[243:40.35]Hold on a second.
[243:45.88]I want to place this right now.
[243:49.88]And then we go boink, boink.
[243:51.16]Boink.
[243:52.86]Because then that'll move down here, right?
[243:59.51]That didn't do what I thought it was going to do.
[244:02.55]Oh.
[244:04.11]I think I win.
[244:04.47]Okay, that's it.
[244:06.23]Game over.
[244:20.59]See?
[244:22.35]I am smart.
[244:25.17]See?
[244:27.67]There's something in there.
[244:29.56]It's not empty.
[244:30.42]Let's watch.
[244:40.56]Apparently it's made out of metal.
[244:45.61]Hold on, can I make it, like, sound hollow?
[244:47.17]Are you smart?
[244:58.75]Me smart!
[245:05.85]Alright, show me some pelts.
[245:11.31]Okay.
[245:13.71]Raven egg.
[245:14.19]That's new.
[245:20.47]Goat seems good.
[245:21.89]What is beaver?
[245:23.13]Sounds kind of good too.
[245:28.57]This thing grows.
[245:35.58]Raven egg.
[245:41.85]Okay, this is important.
[245:48.02]Mantis god.
[245:48.94]I don't even care about the others.
[245:54.24]I want that one.
[246:05.41]Okay.
[246:07.89]I want to put the mantis god up there.
[246:14.90]And I want to give the Mantis God something crazy.
[246:21.84]Oh my god.
[246:23.06]Adder.
[246:25.28]Boom.
[246:30.41]Yeah.
[246:30.99]Adder.
[246:31.41]For sure.
[246:31.75]I did it the wrong way?
[246:35.15]No, I didn't.
[246:38.57]Is this not backwards?
[246:40.15]Is it backwards?
[246:41.71]No, it's not.
[246:42.33]This is the thing that you're sacrificing.
[246:43.75]The thing up top.
[246:44.45]I'm good.
[246:45.05]Yeah, it's not backwards.
[246:45.95]You just made me freak out.
[246:51.00]Alright, we're doing Adder.
[246:51.58]This is gonna be amazing.
[246:55.86]There's only one health glob.
[247:01.89]Wow.
[247:06.24]That's really cool.
[247:07.26]Okay, let's see.
[247:07.92]I hope I get it.
[247:20.35]These are going to turn into something crazy.
[247:28.10]I mean, I'm going to put that out.
[247:36.79]Okay.
[247:49.24]Um, I can't do anything, really.
[247:52.90]I could.
[247:53.32]Oh, wait, hold on, wait, wait.
[247:55.15]This comes back.
[247:56.85]So, I sacrifice, put the wolf here.
[248:00.31]Here.
[248:08.68]So it'll kill that.
[248:09.38]We can do up there, okay?
[248:11.76]Nice.
[248:16.13]Yo, what the fuck?!
[248:20.35]Wait, wait!
[248:21.89]What the fuck happened?
[248:24.03]What?
[248:24.41]I died instantly.
[248:25.63]Oh my god, what happened?
[248:31.05]Crap!
[248:32.83]Oh, that's so sad.
[248:33.79]I thought I was fine.
[248:36.60]The fly, yeah, the fly, but I thought, I didn't think I was gonna die in one turn.
[248:40.12]Shit.
[248:40.38]Okay, one cost, but they're all one, so no matter.
[248:55.51]Power and health.
[248:59.64]It's gonna be this.
[249:05.44]Sigils.
[249:10.12]I mean, yeah, Mantis God.
[249:19.71]God.
[249:31.53]Hey chapstick boy, how are your lips?
[249:32.97]Thanks for the reminder.
[249:36.45]Yeah, we're not going to start at six o'clock.
[249:49.70]What are you looking at?
[249:51.12]Keep your eyes on me.
[249:53.20]That foul, stunted wolf.
[249:55.84]You really want such a creature in your deck?
[249:58.97]The sight of it does try my temper.
[250:01.59]But it has been dealt.
[250:03.15]So it stands.
[250:05.49]Okay.
[250:13.55]Don't forget to... Don't do that.
[250:17.06]What's this?
[250:22.67]Different kind of choice.
[250:23.58]Choose not a specific beast, but decide the cost that you wish to pay.
[250:27.20]Alright.
[250:33.68]Probably one.
[250:38.51]Lewis.
[250:41.75]That's a weird card.
[250:47.57]Stealth and moves around.
[250:48.67]I feel like that's kind of a pain in the ass.
[250:59.89]You're kidding me.
[251:00.45]I've been typing chapstick chaps in chat for months and nobody else does it.
[251:03.79]Oh, when... This is the worst card ever?
[251:12.12]I think it's going to be you.
[251:21.78]Yeah.
[251:29.03]Chapstick.
[251:29.83]I keep running into these.
[251:30.67]I gotta take a look at the map before I do this.
[251:38.77]Okay, um... Defeat him first.
[251:39.91]2-4, holy shit.
[251:59.88]I'll put you over here.
[252:04.63]No, I just woke up from that.
[252:11.21]I'm sorry.
[252:15.21]He's still in Act 1?
[252:16.01]Dude, I don't... I know.
[252:20.88]But whatever, I'm having a good time.
[252:22.40]Who cares?
[252:29.33]Somebody said it was going to take him 10 hours to get out of Act 1.
[252:33.49]He hates this game?
[252:34.33]No, I do not.
[252:34.97]Who said that?
[252:35.59]I think this is fun.
[252:37.67]I did not say that.
[252:38.35]I think this is cool.
[252:38.83]I think this is really, genuinely cool.
[252:46.12]Okay, so... That'll kill that.
[252:50.36]I've got this defense here.
[252:52.04]So we're just going to go... Whack.
[252:54.72]And then we're going to go... Whack.
[252:56.36]Whack.
[253:17.16]We know when you hate something is when you growl at us.
[253:19.04]I don't have enough money.
[253:31.97]Can't do anything.
[253:40.47]Alright, so I did that for a little while.
[253:43.84]Thinking about going back to squirrel.
[253:50.38]Flight.
[253:52.22]Yeah.
[253:53.72]All squirrels have flight.
[253:55.16]Oops, that was not good.
[253:56.26]That's not what I wanted.
[254:08.56]Squirrels can't even attack, man.
[254:10.60]Oh, great.
[254:11.68]Good idea.
[254:19.79]It's alright.
[254:20.49]We're good.
[254:24.62]We're good.
[254:25.20]It's gonna be fine.
[254:32.98]Why did that not work?
[254:37.52]We have to use Lois.
[254:39.22]Ow.
[254:50.69]Ooh!
[254:58.09]What a perfect draw.
[255:12.11]I want to do it again so bad.
[255:13.17]Alright, you suck.
[255:17.96]I'm putting you here instead.
[255:31.11]You have me here, I surrender.
[255:32.17]Why would you do that?
[255:35.13]I'm losing.
[255:35.67]No.
[255:52.39]Alright, nice.
[255:52.79]I'll get you this next round.
[256:03.30]I'm really good in Act 1.
[256:09.74]If you want a really good puzzle game, just try The Witness.
[256:13.39]I don't really like those kind of puzzles.
[256:16.35]I'm more into the puzzles that go like...
[256:24.88]And they open and stuff.
[256:26.00]That's my favorite.
[256:31.76]If a puzzle game has, like, a draw that opens, like... Puzzle noises?
[256:37.58]Yeah.
[256:37.86]Like escape rooms.
[256:40.60]You know what?
[256:40.98]Okay.
[256:41.78]Does anybody here want a multi-billion dollar idea?
[256:45.26]I'll give it to you.
[256:47.40]I have a multi-trillion dollar idea.
[256:51.29]luck whoever wants to do it because like I'm I'm not gonna do it but I'll give it to you I just want five percent of every sale uh so I I made it up so I I'm come I will tell you right now I want five percent of all your sales have an escape room that's not an escape room it is just a huge box that has all the like kind of box puzzle game
[257:16.56]Like, you know, the box inside of the box that has, like, the key.
[257:19.25]You have to twist, like, the bottom.
[257:20.59]That pulls out the little thing that has to go into the slot that's on top.
[257:24.21]Which then, the whole thing opens up, and there's a big thing in here that you have to figure out.
[257:29.75]A huge puzzle box.
[257:34.18]That's not a toy store.
[257:37.04]It's, like, yeah, the room.
[257:37.96]The room, but real.
[257:39.54]Actually make it.
[257:41.08]And the thing takes, like, three hours to complete.
[257:47.26]So the thing starts as like a cube, right?
[257:51.27]A huge cube that's a big wooden box, and there's a padlock on the left of it underneath, and it's like, okay, what's that?
[257:58.07]Well, there's a little device over here that you have to look at that'll give you those three numbers.
[258:02.08]When you do the three numbers in the padlock, that thing opens, like a little tray comes out, and there's a key in there.
[258:07.42]You take the key out, there's a keyhole that's on top of the box, you stick it in, open the top of the box, inside of that comes up, pops up another big puzzle.
[258:19.73]Every time I've played a game like The Room, I go, my God, I wish I could.
[258:24.16]I would pay an exorbitant amount of money to do this in real life.
[258:30.86]An escape room that's not an escape room.
[258:33.50]An escape room that's condensed inside of a gigantic, like, three-hour puzzle box.
[258:40.73]And this thing could be four, three, four, five feet tall and, like, five feet wide.
[258:47.15]That's what an escape room is.
[258:48.01]No, escape room is like all spread out.
[258:49.39]I'm talking condensed in like, go play the room.
[258:51.11]And you know what I'm talking about.
[258:51.97]This is a billion dollar idea.
[258:52.99]5% of every sale.
[258:53.99]Thank you.
[258:56.29]Oh, and by the way, if you don't, if I don't get 5% of sale.
[258:59.47]Oh, God.
[259:03.22]Lawyers.
[259:06.14]You'd be in trouble.
[259:08.42]I'm going to take Reginald.
[259:17.61]Your pack was full, so give me something cool.
[259:22.81]This is worth just going here with full, um... Full items.
[259:27.55]Why not?
[259:32.54]Wouldn't the room just get 5%?
[259:33.90]Imagine you made, like, a puzzle box thing.
[259:43.99]And I heard about it.
[259:45.67]And I mean, that's not like that.
[259:46.90]That's an idea that probably everybody's probably thought of.
[259:50.54]And I'm like demanding 5%.
[259:51.96]I said on my stream that a big puzzle box was a good idea.
[259:57.78]Yeah, you know who else had this great idea?
[260:02.71]Jeffrey the Giraffe from Toys R Us.
[260:06.37]He has a whole store full of them.
[260:25.39]You guys know who Jeffrey the Giraffe is?
[260:33.49]I don't want to grow up.
[260:34.73]I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[260:36.52]I always want to be a Toys R Us kid.
[260:39.42]Now, those commercials would have been really funny if they got like a 50-year-old guy to do it.
[260:45.46]Right?
[260:45.68]Because like, I don't want to grow up.
[260:50.55]I'm never going to grow up.
[260:51.57]I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[260:53.07]And the guy's like 50.
[260:56.72]Like dancing around the store.
[261:03.58]Brainwashing?
[261:07.26]I don't want to grow up.
[261:08.40]I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[261:11.54]Actually, that would be kind of fucked up.
[261:13.84]Yeah, that wouldn't be alright.
[261:15.58]That guy, no.
[261:17.94]But they said that.
[261:18.64]It was like, I don't ever want to.
[261:20.08]I'm never going to grow up.
[261:20.98]I'm a Toys R Us kid forever.
[261:41.48]I don't want to grow up.
[261:42.24]I'm part of the Drew crew.
[261:43.68]Yeah.
[261:57.83]And he's like, he's like, I don't know, like in his fifties, I don't feel like acid reflux.
[262:03.33]I don't want to grow up.
[262:04.77]I'll always be a toy.
[262:05.87]The Russian kid commercial ends.
[262:11.10]His, like, stomach goes up a little.
[262:12.47]He's got, like, a hot dog in one of his hands.
[262:21.25]Alright, Reginald, I want you to kill... Yacht.
[262:35.01]And we're passing.
[262:37.29]What's wrong with this guy?
[262:39.41]I just fucking lost the game again, didn't I?
[262:41.07]No, I didn't.
[262:46.64]Pack rat.
[262:47.72]Wait.
[262:47.88]Do I have three items?
[262:52.16]Alright.
[262:52.68]Let me see the items.
[262:53.88]Look over this way.
[262:54.98]Whatever.
[262:55.32]Dude.
[262:56.58]I want to open up the squirrel thing.
[262:58.48]That's two.
[262:59.54]I need to go bang, bang.
[263:00.87]I actually don't need to use it yet, but I might.
[263:15.93]I should have fucking deceived, whatever.
[263:17.63]I'm an idiot.
[263:18.95]Okay.
[263:20.01]Your puke noises are so gross.
[263:21.53]This is a terrible play.
[263:22.73]I should have just opened up the fucking thing.
[263:24.85]What happens if I... Can I pull this back?
[263:27.23]Can I cancel this?
[263:30.47]So I can break this?
[263:41.29]I don't... I thought I could pull it back for a second.
[263:46.84]I always wanna be a Toys R Us- Okay, I'm done.
[263:50.85]I'm done.
[263:51.07]I'll see you tomorrow.
[263:52.73]I'm done.
[263:53.03]I'll see you tomorrow.
[263:53.85]I'm outta here.
[264:05.46]You know that I have a video?
[264:09.03]of me with no shirt on, that I recorded like 10 of these on my phone.
[264:17.76]And it's me, forward facing with the camera, like forward facing this way, with no shirt on.
[264:25.34]It looks like I have a huge fat stomach.
[264:28.03]And it's me saying that I'm going to try out to be the next Armin for Attack on Titan.
[264:35.99]And
[264:37.95]At the end, I go like, Aaron!
[264:39.67]Aaron!
[264:40.77]Aaron, run away!
[264:42.19]And then I go, and when I do that, I fart in real life.
[264:47.73]And just Holly just starts laughing her ass off.
[264:52.49]Um, the video is fucking crazy.
[264:58.27]It's like I went like too much, I went like too hard, and you just hear Holly start laughing.
[265:04.29]Will you ever show that?
[265:05.63]Maybe.
[265:06.31]Maybe one day.
[265:12.41]Maybe one day.
[265:13.99]Maybe one day, you'll see.
[265:14.81]Ooh.
[265:24.26]One day, maybe you'll see it.
[265:26.74]Randomly, one day, maybe I'll just be like, you know what, who cares?
[265:29.05]I don't even give a shit who gives a fuck.
[265:39.43]You can't say that and not show it.
[265:40.83]Yeah, well, just maybe one day I'll fucking put it up.
[265:44.32]Make it a main channel vid.
[265:53.16]At least do the audio.
[265:55.64]You know, I could do the audio.
[265:59.10]And I would also probably, yeah, maybe.
[266:03.64]Here's the thing.
[266:04.08]I recorded maybe 10 of them.
[266:07.40]So there's like 10 versions of this.
[266:10.69]I really think a lot of people think I'm making this up when I say that I will just sit there and just do something like that over and over again.
[266:20.51]I don't know.
[266:22.61]Maybe there's something wrong with me.
[266:24.02]I don't know.
[266:26.46]I fell asleep two days ago to a seven or eight hour Cathy Mitchell playlist of various infomercials and her showing cooking food and stuff.
[266:41.42]It's, like, better than television to me.
[266:44.58]The, like, eight-hour Cathy Mitchell playlist is more entertaining to me than, like, Mad Men.
[266:54.75]I don't know why.
[266:55.75]I don't know.
[266:58.49]I don't understand why.
[266:59.19]Imagine picking Bird with Flight.
[267:06.27]That would be stupid.
[267:16.15]You just say things?
[267:16.97]I mean, kinda, yeah.
[267:18.36]I... I... I don't know.
[267:23.48]Ten... No, I didn't... Guys.
[267:25.08]Hold on, I gotta be clear.
[267:27.41]I don't... I didn't fart ten times in a row.
[267:30.03]I just, on, like, the seventh or eighth one, it was just, like, just did.
[267:43.01]I want to leak this so bad.
[267:45.31]It's an idea.
[267:46.31]And I want to leak it, but I kind of... I can't.
[267:49.18]Because if I ever actually get to do it... I don't... I want to leak it.
[267:54.34]Because what if it doesn't happen?
[267:55.30]Then maybe you'll never know.
[267:58.00]Not this.
[267:58.54]I'm talking about something else.
[268:11.70]No, I'm not going to leak it.
[268:13.08]I'm not going to leak this thing I'm talking about.
[268:14.39]Because if it actually happens, it's going to be my favorite stream I've ever done in my whole life.
[268:18.45]Nothing will ever compare.
[268:19.43]Ever.
[268:20.13]If I can get it to work.
[268:21.59]I don't know if I can.
[268:23.03]I don't want to build excitement for it.
[268:24.43]But it'll be the best thing.
[268:25.83]Nothing will ever compare.
[268:26.61]It'll be better than Dollhouse.
[268:31.63]At least for me it will.
[268:32.75]For me it will.
[268:34.53]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[268:40.94]I actually think I'm just going to use this here.
[268:52.42]Egomaniac thinks about himself only.
[268:57.56]Not always.
[269:00.99]Maybe leak in two years.
[269:01.99]Okay, so let's go.
[269:05.95]I need something to kill that.
[269:07.45]Do I have two?
[269:22.71]Exactly what I wanted.
[269:23.49]Okay, this will kill that now.
[269:25.17]Dude, what the hell's going on?
[269:26.75]How am I... Break this fucking thing, please.
[269:34.23]Oh, god damn it.
[269:46.68]This is okay.
[270:04.39]Elk.
[270:05.01]With flight.
[270:14.50]Show us the fart video.
[270:17.76]I will.
[270:18.54]I will show it to you.
[270:19.62]One of these days.
[270:20.22]I'll show it to you.
[270:22.76]I will.
[270:26.94]One, two... I mean, it's whatever.
[270:30.78]It's fine.
[270:38.42]This thing's stupid.
[271:30.65]What does this do?
[271:36.01]I don't... This boulder sucks.
[271:40.27]2-4.
[271:40.43]I'm gonna replace you here, I think.
[271:42.59]Yeah.
[271:47.21]And then... I'll save the rest for now.
[271:50.96]Go ahead and knock this all out.
[272:02.38]Oh, the face.
[272:02.96]I think I'm still fine.
[272:08.96]I have a bunch of squirrels already.
[272:10.32]There we are.
[272:11.14]Okay.
[272:13.10]Just kill this stuff.
[272:14.18]Alright.
[272:24.14]I need... Ackrat will kill this.
[272:33.07]And then I can do cockroach.
[272:36.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[272:43.08]Smile, please.
[272:47.46]Ah, it hurts to do that.
[272:55.62]Okay.
[273:04.20]Um, cockroaches, what is it?
[273:05.56]Just dies whenever you play it or something.
[273:08.53]So I gotta just put this out.
[273:09.49]I gotta do squirrel.
[273:10.25]I'm kind of in trouble.
[273:14.65]What does this do again?
[273:15.35]Okay.
[273:20.86]Pack rat.
[273:24.26]Or should I do this?
[273:27.68]No.
[273:28.44]Pack rat.
[273:29.10]I just have to not die.
[273:30.18]Okay.
[273:32.38]Fake fuck Andy?
[273:33.62]What?
[273:33.84]What are you talking about?
[273:35.27]What is this?
[273:42.15]Oh, bones.
[273:45.97]Okay, well, whatever.
[273:56.47]Fake fuck Andy.
[274:12.02]Thank you.
[274:19.68]Boss time, eh?
[274:20.62]It is.
[274:21.04]Get out there.
[274:39.23]Thank you!
[274:52.22]I almost lost.
[275:02.38]When will the fart leak?
[275:07.61]I don't know.
[275:08.41]Maybe like... I don't know.
[275:12.09]Maybe somebody's birthday.
[275:17.05]Always.
[275:23.81]I like this game a lot.
[275:31.59]What is this?
[275:31.99]Did I do this one yet?
[275:37.98]Whose birthday?
[275:38.64]That's for me to decide.
[275:39.70]That was the pelt one.
[275:42.54]Okay.
[275:47.23]Corpse maggots?
[275:49.96]The creature that you own perishes by combat.
[275:51.84]A card bearing this is automatically played in its place.
[275:57.80]Interesting.
[275:58.27]Another wolf would be good.
[276:05.27]Or a mantis.
[276:08.21]I feel like I don't have a lot of damage.
[276:15.16]Leak it if you lose your Trial by Combat Community Night to Ludwig.
[276:20.75]No, because the people that get picked will just throw, so they get to see, like, the leaked fart video.
[276:25.33]No.
[276:30.49]I'm gonna do the wolf.
[276:33.20]I need damage.
[276:36.88]I need, like, more than... Everything I have is, like, one.
[276:42.56]Leak it if you win.
[276:47.90]Maybe I'll leak a screenshot if I win, maybe.
[276:52.28]It's a video, yeah.
[276:54.12]I told you, I'm lying in a bed.
[276:56.69]Aiming it up like this.
[276:58.03]Like the camera's facing this way.
[276:59.35]And I make it so I'm filling the whole frame.
[277:01.83]I look huge.
[277:03.59]I don't know why I was doing it.
[277:04.98]It's fucking horrible.
[277:19.58]Alright, we're going, uh... I don't want to do the GECK right now.
[277:25.27]A TRIOCK!
[277:27.33]BIG A!
[277:36.73]Welcome, everybody.
[277:39.32]I'm playing, uh, Inscription.
[277:42.56]Thanks for the raid.
[277:48.19]Hope you had a good stream, HRock.
[277:50.05]I'm doing really well in this card game.
[277:51.73]I've gotten past the second boss.
[277:53.93]I've gotten to the third area.
[277:55.37]Almost at the end of the game.
[277:57.05]I'm doing very well.
[277:58.21]No one said anything about how poorly I'm playing the game.
[278:08.84]Another raid?
[278:09.46]There's not two raids in a row, right?
[278:16.36]No.
[278:19.71]No.
[278:22.89]Okay, well, that's... There's a lot of... There's like two, three raids today.
[278:28.85]Thank you.
[278:29.12]Appreciate it.
[278:29.50]Well, let's go.
[278:30.58]We're playing Inscription.
[278:33.04]I can't say I'm going to be live for that much longer.
[278:35.14]Maybe like when I get to the end of this run.
[278:36.68]Alright, let's go.
[278:41.36]If you don't know how to play Inscription, neither do I. So I can't really explain it to you because I'm not the person to ask.
[278:50.23]Alright, I'm doing gecko over here on the right.
[278:52.87]And let's go.
[279:04.54]What should I do now?
[279:05.82]Alright, I got squirrel.
[279:06.58]This is going to be perfect.
[279:09.32]Squirrel, squirrel.
[279:12.52]Bang, bang.
[279:17.08]Hold on a minute, though.
[279:18.73]I'm not going to kill that.
[279:36.16]Might be dumb, but whatever.
[279:39.08]I'm just going for the win as fast as I can.
[280:04.93]Grim, is there a penalty?
[280:08.90]What?
[280:09.98]Dr. Oetker raid?
[280:11.54]No way!
[280:13.80]That's crazy!
[280:14.62]Dr. Oetker's been dead since like 1850!
[280:17.35]That's really crazy!
[280:20.03]I can't believe he's raiding.
[280:22.91]He's here right now?
[280:24.17]Holy crap!
[280:30.34]Uh, I don't want to help.
[280:38.92]Give me the pack rat.
[280:46.71]Pack rat, pack rat, pack rat, pack rat.
[280:58.74]Did you hear about Joel shit-talking Dr. Oaker's pizza?
[281:03.02]No.
[281:08.09]No, right?
[281:08.93]That's gotta be fake, right?
[281:15.82]No, no, no.
[281:17.18]He would never.
[281:18.18]Would he, though?
[281:25.00]No way.
[281:32.83]That's fake news?
[281:40.80]Hold on one second.
[281:57.11]Just typing.
[282:00.55]It's in mod chat.
[282:08.32]Alright, squirrel, uh, putting the gecko out, obviously.
[282:15.59]Obviously.
[282:19.05]Will this kill me if I put it here?
[282:20.41]Alright, if I put this here, it's going to be the next turn I'm done, right?
[282:30.43]If I put the gecko there, it will die next turn, right?
[282:37.72]Oh, they said they all have flying.
[282:38.86]Okay.
[282:39.28]Alright.
[282:39.54]Well, then I'm putting it here.
[282:42.77]Let's go, by the way.
[282:45.27]Let's go.
[283:01.80]Yes!
[283:02.88]No!
[283:03.54]Lois is bad.
[283:05.46]But...
[283:19.83]Raids.
[283:20.33]Raids.
[283:20.65]Yeah, a lot of raids.
[283:21.47]Did I just lose?
[283:25.00]What the fuck?
[283:25.40]I actually just lost.
[283:26.38]What the fuck just happened?
[283:36.20]I just threw.
[283:40.74]Whatever.
[283:43.50]I'm not in my element.
[283:44.38]I'm not sitting on a toilet or lying on my back in bed at 4 o'clock in the morning.
[283:49.84]I'm not in my element right now.
[283:53.04]With a game like this.
[283:55.47]I am going to take this because I feel like everything is dying so quickly.
[283:57.93]I need something to take it.
[283:58.97]Power.
[284:12.73]Alright, what do I want?
[284:13.47]Probably a pack rat.
[284:21.68]I love using the pack rat, so I'm gonna... Or the... Yeah, Gek too.
[284:24.74]Yeah.
[284:25.72]Always.
[284:27.54]Always.
[284:31.06]He has to... No, I'm just saying, I'm usually... I'm in my element more when I'm lying on my back like this.
[284:45.00]Okay, Stunted Wolf is actually really good.
[284:46.96]Okay, so now... I'm gonna go this way.
[284:50.92]Yeah, let's go.
[285:01.91]Good.
[285:02.01]These are gross sex jokes?
[285:03.43]What are you talking about?
[285:04.73]When do they make a sex joke?
[285:05.85]What do you mean?
[285:08.03]When did I do that?
[285:08.63]I didn't do that.
[285:13.42]These are gross sex jokes.
[285:37.68]Dude, no!
[285:38.88]Alright, I'm...
[285:42.71]Do this IRL.
[285:43.83]I do that all the time.
[285:44.53]I don't have to do it now.
[285:48.34]What do I have for items?
[285:51.74]Okay, I'm gonna use the cat bone thing over here.
[286:08.17]What's that?
[286:10.07]Your adversary will entirely skip their next turn.
[286:12.67]Yeah, fuck you.
[286:22.66]Okay.
[286:26.87]B. This is free, right?
[286:28.67]Yep.
[286:40.41]Can I at least kill the fisherman again?
[286:42.89]Why are you so dirty today?
[286:47.37]I'm not dirty ever.
[286:48.77]I just look dirty because this thing is... The sun is shining on my face.
[286:53.74]It's right there and it's just glistening off all the face oil that I have.

[287:42.95]Alright, I'm not fucking this one up.
[287:50.41]This is it.
[287:51.51]I keep messing this one up, and I'm an idiot for doing it.
[287:59.04]Yes, it does.
[288:10.06]I'm gonna save this.
[288:18.00]Okay, let's go.
[288:25.88]It's fine.

[288:54.92]And then... I'm good.
[288:59.45]Pulls the pelt.
[289:01.15]Alright.
[289:03.33]And then I play stink bug here.

[289:45.63]Round two.

[290:33.61]It was hot.
[290:34.23]Oh my god.
[290:35.09]I forgot it even existed.
[290:42.61]I forgot it.
[290:43.19]It was like blending in and hiding back here.
[290:48.95]Give me this fucking thing.

[292:14.54]What is long elk?
[292:20.49]Weird.
[292:22.89]I like this one.
[292:24.37]Three, three, two.
[292:25.55]Safe.
[292:27.91]Please replace the eye.
[292:28.79]This one.
[292:40.59]Take the glowy one.
[292:41.31]Does it matter?
[292:45.53]I thought that was just like a funny little thing.
[292:48.71]Did that matter?
[292:53.26]The eyes matter.
[292:55.00]I didn't know that.
[292:55.54]Alright, can I get to the at least past the third boss?
[293:04.62]Or to the third boss?
[293:08.33]Didn't I pick it before?
[293:09.05]I thought I already clicked it.
[293:15.89]Whoa.
[293:21.75]It's expensive though.
[293:22.91]It just can die.
[293:41.42]It's just kind of like tanky.
[293:49.01]Well, let's go get the item.
[293:52.29]Another knife?
[293:57.27]Knife is really helpful.
[294:03.51]I mean, this was awesome, too.
[294:05.76]Big enough.
[294:08.60]And I guess I'm a fan.
[294:11.66]Pretty good items.
[294:13.54]Not bad.
[294:21.23]Okay, you have flight.
[294:22.75]I just hit... Okay, so let's do this.
[294:25.71]Echo always goes out.
[294:27.49]Always, no matter what.
[294:30.04]This is 0-4, so that's fine.
[294:33.40]Keep you here.
[294:33.92]And I got Stunted Wolf too.
[294:36.86]Stunted Wolf will... Maybe I just have Stunted Wolf kill this.
[294:48.69]Just be hitting this.
[294:49.93]Or should I have him over here?
[294:53.53]Eventually it'll kill that.
[294:57.97]Yeah.
[294:58.49]Oh, it's gonna fly over you.
[294:59.45]Okay, cool.
[295:03.60]I'm just gonna pass.
[295:06.94]Okay.
[295:08.10]Okay.
[295:24.60]I think I just lost.
[295:31.60]Did I just lose?
[295:37.67]Should I...
[295:50.65]If I take the knife and then pack rat.
[295:54.39]This is four.
[295:58.54]Kill.
[295:59.00]No.
[295:59.38]I have to sacrifice this.
[296:03.30]Don't use items.
[296:06.58]I have lives.
[296:07.58]Yeah.
[296:11.10]Could I have played that better?
[296:12.25]I feel like I did everything correct.
[296:19.15]I don't know.
[296:20.03]Wolf will kill the bird.
[296:20.97]Yeah, I'm just going to pass again then, I guess.
[296:24.55]Am I okay?
[296:25.19]I think I'm okay.
[296:26.45]Am I dead?
[296:34.47]Not yet.
[296:34.81]Okay.
[296:40.23]This is... Alright.
[296:43.77]Yeah, I'm fine.
[296:44.17]I got kind of scared there.
[296:46.41]I need to use something.
[296:50.32]I'm going to try to use the knife.
[296:51.80]Because the pack rat is going to come out and it's going to be a waste.
[296:58.05]Use the fan instead of the knife.
[296:59.17]Okay, fan.
[297:04.99]And let's go ahead and do this.
[297:09.44]Put pack rat in here.
[297:12.82]Good.
[297:13.78]Okay.
[297:27.01]That will kill that.
[297:28.45]That will... Yeah, that's it.
[297:30.47]That's a win.
[297:39.62]He wasted the fan.
[297:40.36]I just want to replace it.
[297:46.64]I don't like these.
[297:47.22]They're too hard.
[297:48.16]I'm going this way.
[297:59.76]I'll take a two.
[298:13.50]What's this do again?
[298:14.34]This deletes one and gives me, um... What's this do?
[298:21.02]I'm deleting Lois.
[298:21.72]This card's awful.
[298:22.41]It's terrible.
[298:25.93]This card's... This card's awful.
[298:37.86]I'm getting there.
[298:38.44]A little bit longer.
[298:39.85]See if I can at least get to the boss.
[298:41.37]I'll be happy.
[298:54.06]I mean... Put the geck over here.
[298:56.56]I think that's all I can really do right now.
[299:07.44]Is your facecam too small?
[299:08.48]Eh.
[299:19.16]Alright.
[299:21.04]That's gonna be... Alright, so I'm gonna rip a tooth out.
[299:33.35]And then pack her up.
[299:37.35]And then kill this fucking thing.
[299:45.61]Oi!
[299:46.49]Oh, that's it.
[299:47.77]Oh my goodness.
[300:07.60]Alright.
[300:14.61]Fuck.
[300:15.13]I'm so- I was so- I was trying to be so confidently correct, but I don't know, whatever.
[300:18.77]Big dog.
[300:31.52]ADHD brain?
[300:32.32]Yeah.
[300:37.26]Dude, check this out.
[300:38.18]Okay.
[300:38.62]This is gonna be like a 6-6.
[300:40.29]This thing's gonna be insane.
[300:51.33]Get me up there.
[300:51.91]Alright.
[300:54.63]Don't.
[300:55.21]Quit.
[300:56.03]Absolutely squir- Quit squirring around.
[300:59.79]I've got it.
[301:00.37]It's a 6-6.
[301:00.97]I gotta take this shit out now.
[301:04.91]I don't care about the fawn.
[301:07.59]I got the rabbit.
[301:08.43]So we're gonna go squirrel.
[301:11.33]The rabbit does... Whenever this is played, I get a rabbit in my hand.
[301:20.48]So we're gonna... Hold on.
[301:34.41]I'll eat shit.
[301:35.03]I win.
[301:37.71]I'm not gonna use this yet.
[301:38.39]I just beat him one turn.
[301:53.06]Raven.
[301:57.56]Okay, let's make pack rat even better.
[302:11.07]Should I give Pack Rat Flight?
[302:14.95]I could win games in one turn.
[302:16.43]That's what I'm doing.
[302:27.99]But I have to get rid of the Raven.
[302:32.61]I just got it.
[302:36.13]I'll try.
[302:37.29]I'll go for it.
[302:41.40]This is a 6-6 Flying Pack Rat.
[302:43.58]Let's see if it helps.
[302:49.33]I feel like it's gonna be alright.
[302:50.27]I'm at the boss.
[302:58.01]A man stood before you, a man you recognized immediately.
[303:00.43]It was the Trapper.
[303:04.24]You reached out to examine his wares, but he stopped you.
[303:08.74]Sorry, but today you will supply the pelts.
[303:21.49]So this, okay, just wrap.
[303:24.13]When a card bearing this sigil perishes, the creature opposing it perishes as well.
[303:30.91]You don't want to kill that.
[303:31.95]You want some shitty thing to kill that.
[303:33.11]Alright, there it is.
[303:35.83]There it is.
[303:45.74]So I want to use the rabbit.
[303:50.70]And then I'll get... I got another raid.
[303:55.42]Criken coming in with a raid.
[303:57.86]I got... This has been so many raids.
[304:03.67]What's going on?
[304:04.23]Thanks, Criken.
[304:06.75]Welcome, everybody.
[304:08.95]Playing Inscription.
[304:11.17]And I'm about to beat the guy in one turn.
[304:16.80]Because now I can do this.
[304:26.47]I'm gonna kill him in one turn.
[304:33.57]Okay, now what?
[304:35.93]I'm gonna beat him in one second!
[304:36.95]The cycle must continue.
[304:42.19]Let's trade.
[304:42.77]Powerful cards.
[304:48.01]I will accept only the finest pelts for them.
[304:51.98]Um, okay.
[304:53.26]Pray for what you can, but know this.
[304:54.74]The rest will stay and fight for me.
[304:58.34]That's fine.
[304:58.80]I'm just gonna fly over you and kill you in one hit.
[305:00.10]Do I have to pick a card?
[305:09.82]Please read.
[305:12.24]Take the wolf.
[305:15.40]Take his big health cards.
[305:18.07]Like the grizzly?
[305:20.09]I still win.
[305:24.39]No, I still win.
[305:27.83]Take the Bloodhound.
[305:30.23]Oh, that blocks me.
[305:31.29]You're right.
[305:33.27]Okay.
[305:36.23]Who else do I want?
[305:42.88]And the Grizzly.
[305:44.06]Or the Raven.
[305:44.46]Yep.
[305:44.86]Raven.
[305:45.74]Raven!
[305:51.18]Okay, I kill him in one hit.
[305:51.90]I'm done.
[305:56.62]Yeah, I win.
[305:57.16]Bye.
[305:57.80]Just, end turn.
[305:58.44]It's over.
[305:58.88]I won.
[306:01.60]Yeah.
[306:03.38]I didn't do anything.
[306:08.89]Need a light?
[306:11.57]Alright.
[306:15.52]GG.
[306:18.98]And you know I'm taking another pack rat.
[306:20.64]You understand?
[306:21.26]I'm gonna upgrade it again.
[306:28.27]You can see a light in the distance.
[306:30.88]The end is near.
[306:34.34]Let me see.
[306:41.34]Please pay attention.
[306:43.20]Alright.
[306:49.60]Alright.
[306:53.80]What do I want to do here?
[307:01.22]What's better?
[307:01.98]Probably the merge one.
[307:05.27]Wait, is this the merge one?
[307:08.71]No, it's not.
[307:09.53]It's pelts.
[307:14.57]Okay.
[307:15.91]I'm so nervous.
[307:16.39]Alright.
[307:17.55]Who's going in here?
[307:22.62]Who should I put in there?
[307:40.36]Pack rat?
[307:42.04]Buff the rat.
[307:42.64]Maybe one of these?
[307:47.68]Or the stinky one?
[307:53.04]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[307:54.08]Yup, that's an amazing thing I'm gonna do right now.
[307:56.88]Gecko.
[307:58.92]Holy shit, this is huge.
[308:03.86]Absolutely, unbelievably, unequivocally, equivocally huge.
[308:10.00]So I can fight this thing?
[308:12.20]I'm at the boss?
[308:14.26]Your eyes have fixed themselves in the small cabin.
[308:16.38]It's a warm light, a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the night.
[308:20.03]Surely, surely this cabin marked the end of your travels.
[308:22.67]You guys are going to have to help me.
[308:44.80]Just get the fuck out of me.
[308:46.10]I, like, knew something might have happened, too.
[308:55.37]You were presented with an opportunity.
[308:57.35]I don't offer my boons to just any traveler.
[308:59.99]If you're able to pass my trials, you will be rewarded mightily.
[309:03.39]The Trial of the Swift.
[309:08.85]Three drawn cards must include a card with the Sprinter.
[309:14.11]waterborne or they must be rare um yeah I don't think I have it's definitely this one one two three uh packrat is a rare card success
[309:42.24]I will grant you one of my most powerful boons, cards that dramatically alter the game and you don't even need to draw them.
[309:50.90]Boon of the Bone Lord, you will start a battle with eight bones.
[309:56.36]Boon of the Ambidextrous, you may draw twice at the beginning of your turn.
[310:01.34]Boon of the Forest, you will start a battle with grand furs on all your spaces.
[310:11.75]I feel like draw twice is just... I don't know if any of these... These are the tanky things that stay in front, and this is just a shitload of bones.
[310:20.46]I'm taking this one.
[310:22.30]Draw twice.
[310:23.98]We will repeat that once more.
[310:29.06]The Trial of Skins.
[310:29.84]The three drawn cards must include a pelt card.
[310:32.24]No.
[310:34.80]Airborne.
[310:35.26]I have a few of those.
[310:38.35]If you have a ring, you pass automatically.
[310:43.01]Look at the table.
[310:45.14]11 o'clock.
[310:45.44]What does that mean?
[310:46.38]11.
[310:48.06]I don't think... I don't have a ring.
[310:55.27]It has to be airborne.
[311:15.38]What's he doing?
[311:17.89]He managed to get a boon.
[311:19.89]This may be a fair competition.
[311:25.81]He's gonna scream at me.
[311:30.49]I'm ready.
[311:40.50]What the fuck?
[311:43.20]Took your time out there.
[311:46.16]And I'm itching for another game.
[311:49.10]Are you ready to play?
[311:49.84]I hope you're all adequately prepared.
[312:08.09]Perhaps one more to be safe.
[312:11.77]That's not fair.
[312:23.16]shit what do you got okay mole man okay I can do squirrel smoke
[312:53.93]Right here, right?
[312:58.59]Put snow down on the right.
[312:59.55]Because then it'll be... One?
[313:01.63]No.
[313:03.13]I don't want to screw this up.
[313:03.97]Because that will hit.
[313:07.79]That should be correct.
[313:08.67]I think that's correct.
[313:11.95]And then should I put the smoke pelt out?
[313:14.35]Just to get the bones and get it hit?
[313:16.17]I wonder where the bones should go.
[313:18.75]All the way next to him?
[313:23.41]Bug the lane with the pelt.
[313:26.79]Save it.
[313:27.27]Okay.
[313:27.97]Alright, let's go.
[313:33.14]Okay.
[313:39.30]I'm, like, nervous.
[313:40.10]I feel like I'm going to look like an idiot.
[313:42.78]Okay, I have a rat king, which gives me bones.
[313:45.96]I have a lot of bone things, but I don't know what... This is going to hit three times, so we have to go like this.
[313:53.43]I can draw twice.
[313:55.93]Two squirrels?
[313:58.92]And then go straight up here?
[314:02.50]I have items too, yeah.
[314:09.89]Nice.
[314:10.15]Alright.
[314:12.80]I don't want to get hit three times here.
[314:15.00]So I'm going to go... Squirrel.
[314:17.86]Stunted wolf.
[314:18.88]Right down Main Street here.
[314:21.75]Wolf pelt here.
[314:23.07]Smoke here.
[314:24.11]Got it?
[314:26.73]Oh my god, I have this thing.
[314:27.71]Alright, this is going all the way to the left.
[314:31.37]This is going all the way to the left.
[314:33.63]It's going to tank this damage.
[314:42.38]That's what I'm doing.
[314:44.42]And then the smoke is gonna go here.
[314:48.60]Um, right.
[314:49.52]Okay, so let's do this.
[314:55.07]And then pelt here.
[314:56.43]Let's go.
[315:02.67]Yeah, let's go.
[315:07.32]What the fuck is he doing?
[315:08.82]What is happening right now?
[315:09.84]Why is he doing this?
[315:11.10]What's he doing this?
[315:11.96]What the fuck is going on?
[315:12.90]He didn't take another zero.
[315:13.98]What the hell just happened?
[315:18.20]Does he do that before every turn?
[315:22.60]Oh my god, it's over.
[315:24.96]Oh, he's putting on the different masks.
[315:30.72]Oh.
[315:33.49]That's not good.
[315:34.69]That's really bad.
[315:38.75]It's not over.
[315:43.68]Okay.
[315:47.24]I think I just have to pass, right?
[315:48.46]Or should I put the scroll down to not... Ay-yi-yi.
[315:52.46]I have to pass, I think.
[315:53.16]Should I... Should I use the knife right now?
[316:06.71]Or just block him with the smoke?
[316:15.63]Oh, God.
[316:19.85]Oh!
[316:19.97]Okay, I have to... Fucking bullfrog.
[316:34.65]I have to knife.
[316:36.59]I'm in trouble.

[316:49.11]Knife hourglass amalgam.
[316:50.23]Yeah.
[316:52.15]What's this?
[316:59.19]What is this?
[317:06.66]It's a card cut.
[317:08.26]Oh, I thought it was a stab.
[317:10.88]Okay, so I obviously want to kill the amalgam, right?
[317:15.18]Or should I kill?
[317:15.74]This is going to be three damage regardless.
[317:23.15]Right click this?
[317:26.31]Let him hook the squirrel.
[317:31.09]I know my health is just... I'm dead.
[317:35.21]What should I get rid of?
[317:39.09]This one here.
[317:39.55]Fill Amalgam, put Bulkrob onto Mantis God.
[317:42.82]Yeah, that's the play.
[317:50.80]I have another squirrel too.
[317:52.66]Dead, man.

[318:08.23]Now you can't do shit?
[318:10.09]Now?

[318:17.41]So now if I put the pelt down in front of this... Will he still... Okay.

[326:28.49]I'm gonna do... Just... I'm gonna put this out.
[326:35.24]Because it's free.
[326:36.54]Fuck it.
[326:39.02]Fuck it.
[326:39.52]Fuck it.
[326:42.46]Fuck it.
[326:42.74]Let's go.
[326:43.46]Fuck it.
[326:47.55]Fuck it.
[326:47.83]Let's go.
[326:48.51]No.
[326:48.69]No.
[326:51.27]What are you gonna do?
[326:51.83]Chat's saying a million different things.
[326:53.32]I know, man.
[326:55.60]He's the prospector.
[326:56.60]Whatever, I... Whatever.
[327:14.78]Dude, I don't have... Shit!
[327:26.79]That has to die.
[327:27.41]Okay, um... I think I geck that, and then I sacrifice it after.
[327:34.85]Or I just let the pell get hit by it.
[327:38.50]That's what I would do.
[327:44.44]Could be this.
[327:44.98]Go.
[327:58.87]Wait wait wait wait wait. What happened? What happened? What happened? Oh my god, I thought he had 2 health. Oh my god what the fuck happened.
[328:05.23]What just happened? What- I ruined everything. Okay, okay. Alright. Oyoyoyoyoyoy oioioioioio ooi.
[328:20.23]That's alright.
[328:23.10]Squirrel?
[328:30.23]Okay, I have two squirrels.
[328:31.07]Back route on the right.
[328:35.02]Right?
[328:35.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[328:37.72]What about the hook?
[328:38.28]Does he have the hook out yet?
[328:42.40]Back far left.
[328:43.64]This hook is going to kill me.
[328:49.13]Stop.
[328:50.15]What?
[328:51.89]He has the hook right now, so I want to just... Am I dead if I don't block...
[328:58.75]Why is it so tense?
[329:00.03]Pack rat wins.
[329:00.93]Pack rat kills in one.
[329:03.17]Will it though?
[329:06.22]You're at minus six.
[329:07.16]Pack rat will kill.
[329:08.18]Will it?
[329:09.90]Please tell me you're right.
[329:11.52]So if I go far left with it.
[329:12.52]Attack left, defend right.
[329:14.62]Alright, let's go.
[329:15.06]You're almost stalling.
[329:17.00]Let's do it.
[329:17.36]Let's go.
[329:26.69]That's it.
[329:28.96]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[329:30.44]Oh, fuck.
[329:30.86]Yeah, I think I just won.
[329:33.28]Don't delete it.
[329:34.00]Please don't delete it.
[329:37.66]This damn moon.
[329:39.45]It's dramatic, yes.
[329:41.01]But it provides no value to my board.
[329:43.71]I wonder.
[329:50.17]Now that is value.
[329:53.36]Oh, out of cards, I'm sorry.
[329:55.02]I will attempt to hasten your demise.
[329:57.39]The moon will be your mercy.
[330:00.87]Come on.
[330:08.75]I win.
[330:09.05]I win.
[330:10.95]I just beat him.
[330:13.01]He's going to go buy this, right?
[330:14.00]And that's six.
[330:14.46]I won.
[330:15.44]I won.
[330:24.28]I won.
[330:28.16]Akarat... I can't even do anything.
[330:33.28]I could make him not... He thinks wrong.
[330:35.76]It defends against... You have to win it... You have to win in three turns.
[330:42.31]Just Hourglass him?
[330:46.13]What the fuck is this?
[330:52.43]I can't even do anything.
[331:03.16]Huh?
[331:11.69]So what?
[331:12.07]I just lose?
[331:12.77]This dipshit has airblock.
[331:17.27]Oh.
[331:20.37]Can I sacrifice the pelt?
[331:21.89]I don't... No, I can't.
[331:23.51]Yeah, this is it.
[331:25.02]I just lose.
[331:30.92]Uh...
[331:33.75]That's unfortunate.
[331:34.47]22.
[331:38.05]Oh.
[331:38.25]We made it so far.
[331:58.51]I feel like I'm not supposed to win.
[332:03.94]That was cool.
[332:04.58]This game's cool.
[332:08.12]Well, I got to the end once.
[332:11.48]I probably could have beat him.
[332:12.58]Yeah, probably.
[332:13.20]But, you know, I'm not that great.
[332:19.09]Cost.
[332:19.93]Uh, this one.
[332:21.69]Alright, that's gonna be it, though.
[332:23.57]Uh, it's getting late.
[332:26.45]Power and health.
[332:27.23]I mean, obviously this one.
[332:31.39]And...
[332:33.44]This is... This is, I mean, I upgraded this like three times.
[332:41.53]It's alright.
[332:54.30]That was the end of the first act.
[332:55.28]I imagine so.
[332:58.36]This game's fun.
[332:58.84]You have to beat him to get to act two.
[333:04.50]Please play this again.
[333:06.78]Yeah, no, that was really fun.
[333:08.62]This would be something maybe that we just jump into sometimes.
[333:13.42]I'm not on the time limit.
[333:20.69]What is that?
[333:23.63]Okay, so now I think that's it, yeah.
[333:25.95]That was cool.
[333:32.79]I can see why people think the game's really good.
[333:39.81]You actually were good?
[333:40.75]Yeah, I mean, not really, but... I definitely need help from you guys.
[333:50.03]That was really enjoyable.
[333:51.35]Oh, the clock puzzle, that's right.
[333:52.82]11 o'clock, right?
[333:53.38]Does it have to be a certain hand?
[334:02.62]Oh, there we go.
[334:06.82]Does it fit?
[334:09.87]Oh, if you have a ring, you automatically just beat it.
[334:14.05]Cool.
[334:18.81]More of these.
[334:19.27]Alright, awesome.
[334:29.65]So, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[334:30.43]We're going to do some Elden Ring tomorrow.
[334:35.26]Probably 4 o'clock Pacific.
[334:39.48]We're not going to start at 6.
[334:40.54]I just had some stuff going on.
[334:43.62]I had some stuff going on this afternoon.
[334:46.65]So I'll see you guys tomorrow at 4.
[334:48.79]For Elden Ring PvP.
[334:51.01]Tomorrow we're just going to be chilling for... I don't know how long this stream is going to be tomorrow.
[334:54.95]Long enough to at least hang out and do PvP for a few hours.
[334:56.89]3 or 4 maybe.
[334:59.11]Why Elden Ring?
[335:00.86]Because me and Ludwig are going to do a thing where we have community members fight each other.
[335:06.71]um that's probably at some point later this week or next week and I want to do a little bit of trials there's one more image one more image
[335:38.08]Where is it?
[335:52.05]What is it?
[335:53.43]Is it an image?
[335:58.66]What do you mean?
[336:01.14]When are you going to leak the fart?
[336:07.49]I'm telling you, if you're good on somebody's birthday, it'll be someone's birthday, and I'll say, happy birthday.
[336:17.74]That's a weird thing to say.
[336:19.98]I never tweeted this stream.
[336:21.38]Whatever.
[336:24.34]That's fine.
[336:26.74]Thanks for hanging out, though.
[336:28.72]Thank you to Lania Lazar.
[336:36.16]Patriarch, Criken.
[336:38.28]The three raids today with a lot of people, so if you stuck around and watched me fumble through the first act of inscription, then... Laina.
[336:50.88]I know, I'm so bad.
[336:53.84]Lanya.
[336:57.62]Dude.

[337:08.22]My brain has trouble.
[337:10.23]Thank you so much for the rates, though.
[337:11.25]You guys are amazing.
[337:15.03]I... I'm just... Thank you.
