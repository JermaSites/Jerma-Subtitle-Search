[00:31.53]I now have a compressor on my voice.
[00:34.35]What do you think about that one?
[00:35.45]Now I get to sound like a radio commercial.
[00:39.16]Ew, ew, I don't like it.
[00:40.58]Ew.
[00:40.78]Oh, you don't like that?
[00:46.56]Well, what do you think about this?
[00:50.32]Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have returned.
[00:52.56]You thought you could get rid of me.
[00:54.06]Oh, you thought you could get rid of me.
[00:56.25]You didn't get rid of me so easily.
[00:59.39]It's me, people.
[01:01.48]You can break the fuck out of here.
[01:04.18]Yeah, I can do that now.
[01:09.23]Losing viewers.
[01:14.67]Told you he was coming back.
[01:17.15]But alright, let's go over this.
[01:19.07]So I get complaints.
[01:22.31]Every single stream.
[01:24.81]Where people say, hey, dude, you sound like shit.
[01:28.23]I can't hear you I can't I turn your mic up you sound awful why can I hear a loud buzzing in your room and I'm just like I yeah it was time so now I you act you actually should be able to hear me and I shouldn't sound like anymore are we a hype train no not again not again I just turned it on not we're doing this the second time in a row a second hype train in a row
[01:58.93]Is this going to happen?
[01:59.77]This is going to happen every single day.
[02:03.27]This is going to happen every single day, isn't it?
[02:07.71]Are you kidding me?
[02:08.55]Twitch, you have... They've gamified this shit by this point.
[02:15.01]This is going to happen every day.
[02:24.01]We're already at level 2.
[02:25.89]Oh my god, this is going to happen every day, isn't it?
[02:29.84]This is gonna happen every single day.
[02:37.77]You guys, you motherfuckers are gonna make me rich.
[02:44.43]I'm not even kidding.
[02:52.26]Hype train, level three.
[02:55.84]New tax bracket, POG.
[03:01.68]My cpa is gonna I I have a cpa and This year I'm gonna come to him and be like hey Uh, what's going on?
[03:10.91]Just want to let you know that my income increased like times five What?
[03:16.35]Yeah, uh this thing called the hype train on Twitch Uh, you know, he's like, oh, yeah, I was I love the hype train.
[03:21.91]I'd be like, yeah.
[03:22.53]Yeah, I get me too.
[03:23.89]I guess old material Tax hype
[03:34.49]Honest to God though, this is gonna happen every day.
[03:36.75]Can I configure this to not happen?
[03:41.63]Why do I sound like this?
[03:42.53]And we're gonna get that question a lot.
[03:43.86]That's because I actually have a compressor.
[03:47.02]I actually have a real audio device now.
[03:48.78]I didn't just plug my mic into my computer.
[03:55.06]I didn't plug my microphone directly into my computer.
[04:05.06]You ready?
[04:05.50]We can do stuff like this while it's hurting.
[04:08.59]Let's turn the compressor up even more.
[04:10.43]More.
[04:11.51]Even more.
[04:12.55]It's at 100% right now.
[04:16.03]Well, imagine if... Here's the reason why I don't like compressors.
[04:19.40]Let's see if we can fuck up the compressor.
[04:20.50]I'm going to talk high and then talk low.
[04:26.33]This sounds way worse.
[04:27.23]I know it does.
[04:28.23]Because the way that I'm talking.
[04:29.87]I hate compressors because you can hear it like... Okay, so... I hate that.
[04:35.86]I hate the fucking sound of my... I hate the voice.
[04:38.06]I hate... I don't like the way it sounds.
[04:40.32]Let's bring it back down.
[04:40.94]You ready?
[04:45.44]This is without the compressor.
[04:46.50]Oh, this is what streamers sound like when they don't have it on.
[04:50.15]You see, it's a cheat code.
[04:52.31]It's a way for cheaters to be able to sound better, and this is what it's on.
[04:59.28]I'm talking the exact same way.
[05:02.14]I have not changed any single way that I'm talking.
[05:04.94]Alright, here we go.
[05:09.32]Ready?
[05:10.66]Hey, how are you?
[05:12.02]How are you doing?
[05:14.02]Hey, how are you?
[05:15.14]How you doing?
[05:15.90]Now it's at zero.
[05:16.50]What do you think?
[05:21.14]Compressors are just lying.
[05:25.17]I can't have, like, a little bit of... I want to be, like, professional sounding.
[05:29.65]I can't have, like, 10%?
[05:36.07]You can't even give me 10%?
[05:39.60]Why?
[05:41.26]Compressors are cheating.
[05:43.84]I know it is.
[05:47.58]Look, can I at least, like, tell you the... Hold on.
[05:50.60]Am I too loud now?
[05:51.74]We gotta do this together.
[05:54.04]We actually just did another fucking hype train.
[05:56.98]Another one is done.
[05:59.54]You guys just dump thousands of dollars on this.
[06:02.64]Okay.
[06:04.08]So, should I turn it down?
[06:05.24]Or is this good?
[06:06.62]But if I scream, it's gonna sound... Hold on.
[06:10.42]Hey!
[06:11.28]Hey, everybody!
[06:11.80]Welcome to the stream!
[06:12.76]Like, didn't that sound bad?
[06:13.84]I have to do, like, 2% compression.
[06:20.65]It's fine.
[06:22.55]Okay, I have to try to peek my mic to see what happens.
[06:24.54]I don't know.
[06:25.44]I tested this before.
[06:32.73]Is that doing anything?
[06:36.91]I actually can't tell if it's doing anything.
[06:40.15]It's not compressing it down, though.
[06:45.40]Alright, hold on.
[06:46.04]I knew I was going to have to do this live.
[06:49.08]Turn this off.
[06:50.54]Okay, you ready?
[06:54.88]How's that?
[06:56.06]Will you let me have this?
[06:58.21]Will you please let me have this?
[07:00.95]I need people to come into the channel and I need them to hear me sound like this.
[07:04.39]So they go, oh, that dude's fucking, that dude's cool.
[07:07.53]He sounds cool.
[07:10.25]That doesn't sound good.
[07:13.41]That sounds way worse, but it's- it's compre- go b- You want me to- Go back to the old mic.
[07:23.07]This is the old mic.
[07:24.31]It's just actually plugged into real- a real piece of hardware, not right into the back of my fucking d- computer!
[07:30.81]Alright.
[07:39.47]How's that?
[07:40.27]Is that good?
[07:41.55]I think we're good there.
[07:43.97]I think we're good there.
[07:49.41]Do 100%.
[07:49.64]I just did that.
[07:52.24]Do more.
[07:55.28]How's that?
[07:57.20]I'm going to stay at 100%.
[07:58.54]Just because everyone... This thing... This is a nice piece of hardware.
[08:01.46]And just because everybody is fucking... Everybody is causing lots of problems with me.
[08:06.07]And everybody is talking all this shit.
[08:07.65]I'm going to keep... I'm keeping it at 100% this entire stream.
[08:15.34]This is the generic streamer voice.
[08:16.80]I know it is.
[08:17.30]That's why it's going... It's staying on the... Look, this is what you're supposed to... At least you can hear that still.
[08:29.34]At least you can hear that still.
[08:33.31]That's never going away, alright?
[08:35.43]Look, just get... You got to get used to it.
[08:37.31]It's... You don't... This thing is nice.
[08:41.75]It's a nice piece of hardware and I'm keeping it.
[08:46.14]Okay, here we go.
[08:46.94]Are we done?
[08:47.67]We're ready to play.
[08:48.17]We're playing Katana ZERO today.
[08:53.87]Look, let me, let me, okay.
[08:55.45]Would you rather this?
[08:57.83]Hold on.
[09:04.45]What if I was just like this the whole stream instead?
[09:06.79]Would you be happy?
[09:10.03]Like, would you want me just to be, is this, this is better?
[09:12.99]Do you think this is better?
[09:18.29]hold on what do I turn down a couple things what does it sound like this sounds good it's perfect now it's actually perfect this is perfect okay what if I turn the compressor up all the way now how does that sound does that sound a little bit better should I keep this should I be professional professional streamer thanos
[09:47.33]This is awful.
[09:48.07]I need to hear what this sounds like.
[09:49.23]Look, it's the first time I get to play with this.
[09:52.05]Hold on, let me see.
[09:54.86]Hello.
[09:55.72]What does this sound like?
[09:56.88]This is fucked.
[10:00.26]It's just like pitch shifted by 1%.
[10:03.30]This sounds weird.
[10:06.54]This sounds like, this is what happens, I feel like what people sound like when, like if you do drugs and then somebody talks to you, does this what it sounds like?
[10:16.07]Hold on.
[10:17.27]No, I don't like, I don't like that.
[10:18.45]I don't like that.
[10:19.05]Hold on.
[10:20.41]What about if we go lower?
[10:21.95]Can I go lower?
[10:23.13]How's that?
[10:23.73]That's a little different.
[10:25.25]That's way different.
[10:29.35]Hello everybody. This is ???
[10:40.35]monkaS, monkaS.
[10:46.83]hey we did the uh we did the hype train everybody thanks again for giving money during the hype train we're at level five right now level five and I oops wait hey okay alright I'm done playing around with this
[11:11.54]This doesn't sound right.
[11:12.86]It's because the compressor's at 100%.
[11:15.25]That's better.
[11:16.13]Alright, this is what we're going with.
[11:17.49]If you don't like it, then I'm sorry, but this was a nice, expensive piece of equipment, and I was told by two or three data aggregators, you need to improve your audio quality, or no one's ever gonna like you.
[11:30.93]And then I said, fuck.
[11:36.02]Alright, we're going.
[11:37.42]I'm ready.
[11:39.15]This is KatanaZero.
[11:42.91]This is KatanaZero, welcome, and listen to the sound quality though.
[11:47.35]This is, my mic is supposed to sound like this.
[11:50.57]We're going.
[11:57.40]To put on the webcam mic.
[11:59.04]I think that's the problem.
[12:00.12]I think a lot of people are just so used to hearing just loud sounds that, alright, it don't matter.
[12:07.88]We're going.
[12:12.63]Everybody's so used to hearing like... Your voice is too nasally.
[12:19.07]It's not.
[12:21.61]Wait a minute.
[12:23.19]How's that?
[12:23.65]Is that better?
[12:24.07]Is this better?
[12:25.19]How's that?
[12:26.47]Okay, that's probably better.
[12:28.37]I think it might be better.
[12:29.11]Are we good?
[12:30.87]That's better now, I think.
[12:32.18]Let me see.
[12:35.40]Is that... Hold on.
[12:38.90]Saved.
[12:39.68]Saved.
[12:40.28]Saved.
[12:44.01]That's not because I like an equalizer on.
[12:51.51]Don't use there are no filters on.
[12:58.77]Well, I think you have a lovely voice.
[13:00.67]Hey, thanks.
[13:01.21]I appreciate that.
[13:04.12]Move closer, move closer to the mic.
[13:06.66]I don't think you want that.
[13:08.30]If I move closer to the mic, then I sound more of a thing that you guys tell me you don't want to hear.
[13:17.38]Alright, I'm leaving it the way it is.
[13:18.78]I'm leaving it the way it is.
[13:20.19]You guys have just been so used to hearing me on shit quality that everyone's like, Oh wait, he sounds good now!
[13:28.11]I don't like it!
[13:40.72]Oh my god, we did a level 5 fucking hype trade.
[13:48.03]Go back.
[13:48.69]I want the shitty one.
[13:56.30]We can hear everything in your room?
[14:00.38]What?
[14:06.94]We can hear every car.
[14:13.49]No, you can't.
[14:14.07]I'm looking over here right now.
[14:20.14]No, that's not true.
[14:22.44]You know why I know that's not true?
[14:23.82]Because this is what it was before.
[14:32.55]That's what it was before.
[14:44.03]Perfect, huh?
[14:46.61]Too much... There's zero compression on the voice right now.
[14:52.21]Guys, I'm fucked.
[14:54.13]It's perfect.
[14:55.27]Perfect.
[14:55.75]Keep it like this.
[14:56.69]Perfect.
[14:57.83]It's perfect.
[15:04.27]The rumors are an integral part of the stream.
[15:08.92]No, they're not.
[15:10.10]I'm trying to get rid of these motherfuckers.
[15:12.14]Are you serious?
[15:13.72]I'm putting it back on.
[15:15.74]Alright, there we are.
[15:17.66]I'm keeping it like this.
[15:18.48]Let's go.
[15:18.94]I'm done.
[15:19.36]I'm done.
[15:19.66]I'm done.
[15:19.92]We're going.
[15:20.32]We're going.
[15:20.66]I'm done.
[15:22.02]Let's go.
[15:28.79]I gotta play a video game, okay?
[15:31.87]Like, for instance, the one you're about to see on the screen.
[15:34.47]Look at that.
[15:37.37]Has he peaked the mic yet?
[15:38.43]Yeah, I can't.
[15:39.21]I can't peak the mic anymore.
[15:53.46]God damn it.
[15:55.33]Alright.
[15:55.77]Anyways, let's talk about this.
[15:57.13]We just did another, we just did another hype train thing.
[16:04.15]I, we just did another hype train two days in a row.
[16:06.79]It's fucking ridiculous.
[16:09.47]Uh, Kaj, Kaj Tech gave 5,000 bits.

[16:15.07]$50 fucking dollars.
[16:20.30]Scream into the mic so I know it's fine.
[16:22.14]This is... Alright, we've been sitting here for 20 minutes trying to get my audio right.
[16:25.76]I'm not sitting here for 20 minutes anymore.
[16:28.19]This is my... It's a GoXLR.
[16:30.73]It's a great piece of equipment.
[16:32.77]Okay?
[16:33.37]And it sounds really fun and good.
[16:35.71]I don't know if anybody likes change.
[16:37.95]But... Here we go.

[17:45.61]Thanks for coming.
[17:48.22]I need to tweak it more.
[17:48.96]I just- I turned off the compressor.
[17:54.67]Your voice sounds like a JPEG.
[17:57.63]Goddammit, man.
[17:59.35]This is Katana0.
[18:00.29]Thanks for coming to the streamer, buddy.
[18:01.57]Hope you have a good fucking day today.

[18:14.94]I see.
[18:15.48]Then let's start from the beginning.
[18:20.23]Askisoft presents... Katana ZERO.
[18:27.91]Fair enough, sounds like you're chewing on marbles.
[18:29.45]No, that's not even accurate.
[18:34.27]There's too much base.
[18:35.27]Should I turn the... Should I turn the base down?
[18:40.25]bass hold on ready bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass is that better how about this bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass bass better too much you sound like a radio dj that's I that's intentional that's what they sound good
[19:09.11]You know what I'm gonna do?
[19:09.99]I'm gonna slowly... I'm gonna slowly increase the compressor.
[19:14.35]I'm gonna start at zero, and over the next, like, two weeks, I'm gonna increase this shit 1% every day.
[19:20.88]And eventually, you're not even gonna realize it happened.
[19:27.48]How's this?
[19:30.73]You're a monster.
[19:39.06]The compressor's not even turned on.
[19:40.92]This is what the compressor turned on.
[19:42.37]Do you understand?
[19:43.63]This is the compressor right now.
[19:45.83]It's on right now.
[19:48.03]Compressor is off right now.
[19:50.23]Everybody hates the radio voice.
[19:52.75]Don't people stream like this?
[19:54.66]Everybody streams like this.
[19:57.18]There's like 500,000 streamers on Twitch and like 490,000 of them all have good quality audio.
[20:01.30]I...
[20:10.75]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[20:11.75]I can't do it right now.
[20:14.13]This shitty box that I had before, this thing sucks.
[20:23.98]You're being gaslit right now.
[20:25.60]I definitely am.
[20:26.72]There's no way I don't, there's no way.
[20:34.11]I'm being, I am being, like, gaslit by so many people here.
[20:47.47]I'm not watching till your compressor's at 110%.
[20:48.95]Someone's calling the phone.
[20:56.52]Have you arrived?
[20:59.56]Who the fuck are you?
[21:00.16]Leave me alone.
[21:03.55]Do not hang up again.
[21:05.19]I need details on your location.
[21:09.05]I'll be there soon?
[21:09.87]I'll be there soon.
[21:17.90]I need you to work as quickly as possible.
[21:19.40]There's not much time left.
[21:22.38]The scientist is being held somewhere within the factory.
[21:24.62]And I'm like... You guys, you did it.
[21:29.43]Congratulations.
[21:30.59]Because now I'm like talking differently.
[21:32.79]I'm speaking differently now because of what you guys have been telling me.
[21:35.75]I'm speaking different.
[21:38.59]Alright, understood.
[21:39.15]Free him.
[21:43.13]This is just the way that I actually sound in real life.
[21:48.56]He's already getting the bad ending.
[21:49.75]I don't even know what that means.
[21:50.75]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[21:52.73]Alright, Katana ZERO.
[21:54.23]God damn it.
[21:57.57]Oh, I'm so... You fucked me up.
[22:01.79]Oh, by the way, this game actually has a warning on it that it will give you a headache.
[22:09.84]There's a warning here.
[22:11.70]Turn the music up?
[22:12.46]Okay, I can do that.
[22:22.35]Has it got good music?
[22:25.99]That's good.
[22:29.93]How does that sound?
[22:33.66]I have to, like, listen to this back.
[22:37.44]Alright, so let's go.
[22:38.58]I can hit bullets?
[22:42.68]Is this, like, a hit once you die scenario, or what?
[22:47.14]Okay, you can swing up.
[22:56.37]Oh, you can pet the cat.
[22:59.71]You got a podcast voice now.
[23:01.51]God damn it.
[23:02.59]Stop it.
[23:05.35]This is what I get.
[23:08.39]What?
[23:09.49]This is what I get for having 10 years of like the same crusty ass audio.
[23:16.02]Press Y to eject.
[23:17.14]Why would I eject?
[23:27.53]I can hear your mouth sounds.
[23:34.87]No, you can't hear my mouth sounds.
[23:37.55]What is going on?
[23:41.30]Oh, it shows the level you just did.
[23:42.72]Okay.
[23:47.68]I need to pay attention.
[23:48.44]This game is supposed to be hard.
[23:49.48]Stop.
[23:53.46]RT.
[23:53.62]Oh, it's like a dash.
[23:55.62]Okay, cool.
[24:00.80]Turn it off.
[24:03.40]You have a really phlegmy voice.
[24:04.92]I don't, though.
[24:05.98]I don't.
[24:06.80]I don't.
[24:11.54]I should have done it gradually.
[24:12.66]This game's pretty good.
[24:24.69]You can pause time?
[24:32.96]Does this kill you?
[24:40.05]Alright, I didn't know if it killed you or not.
[24:44.99]I can hear his teeth!
[24:50.79]You can't hear my fucking teeth, okay?
[25:04.89]You can't hear my teeth!
[25:06.59]Teeth don't make sounds!
[25:08.01]Alright, you- That's not my teeth!
[25:19.22]That's the controller!
[25:21.80]What do you think I'm sitting here going like- That's not my fucking teeth.
[25:35.03]I can hear his heart.
[25:35.75]Alright, what does this nobody do?
[25:39.98]Go over here.
[25:41.58]Why?
[25:41.86]Ooh, I bit my tongue.
[25:48.82]Ooh, I bit my tongue.
[25:50.22]Fuck, I'm reaching.
[25:52.34]Because I'm trying to get you guys off this.
[25:54.26]I'm trying to get you guys off this so bad.
[25:55.88]Like, I'm trying to get you guys away from this shit.
[25:58.06]And I can't.
[25:58.64]I'm trying to think of what to do.
[26:03.70]Oh, ouch.
[26:04.10]I was starting to think I wouldn't make it.
[26:05.70]Thank you.
[26:06.10]I saved him, right?
[26:15.72]Oh.
[26:16.48]I didn't win.
[26:22.39]Psychox yetpi.
[26:24.25]I hope we got that on tape.
[26:28.15]Hey, boys.
[26:29.75]It's time to take the trash out.
[26:33.62]I can do shit like that now Oh, what?
[26:43.69]Did I die?
[26:45.65]Alright, I guess not
[27:01.17]This is actually a pretty fun game.
[27:02.75]So far.
[27:06.58]How fast do the bullets go?
[27:12.46]It just does it again.
[27:14.46]Mind the lasers, boys.
[27:17.40]Yeah.
[27:21.99]Look at that.
[27:25.21]Switch back to Thanos voice.
[27:28.12]No, I can't, that's, I'm not gonna use that, is it?
[27:31.53]You understand that me turning on the compressor and me turning on the 10% pitch shift Thanos voice is the same cheat.
[27:40.49]You guys know that, right?
[27:45.19]That's a really easy +2.
[27:49.24]Make us laugh, funny boy.
[27:51.00]Okay, okay, hey guys, I guess I'm gonna make you laugh.
[27:57.59]That's what I do here!
[27:59.23]Look at me dancing in front of you!
[28:05.15]Are we good?
[28:09.47]Your employers are displeased that the mission target was terminated before extraction.
[28:14.92]What?
[28:16.26]I could have saved him?
[28:19.98]Go home and rest.
[28:20.52]You'll receive a new assignment tomorrow.
[28:38.29]Drink herbal tea.
[28:39.43]Yes.
[28:41.25]I should have gradually done this.
[28:42.41]You guys never would have even fucking known.
[28:44.77]If I had done 1-2% per stream.
[28:47.98]Nobody would have even known.
[28:48.88]I can watch TV.
[28:58.02]At least 12 have been reported dead or injured at an abandoned factory in the 3rd district.
[29:01.36]Okay.
[29:04.13]All they did is... Dawood Bey, a government scientist, first reported missing three weeks ago.
[29:13.54]Does not... It sounds so bad.
[29:15.56]Guys, this is... I can't... I'm not... I can't go back.
[29:20.84]This is an elaborate new audio setup.
[29:23.32]I'm never going back.
[29:26.23]Ever.
[29:26.99]That's impossible.
[29:27.91]It took like two hours to do this.
[29:48.84]These people are fools.
[29:50.28]I don't know what to say.
[29:59.95]Nine days remain.
[30:06.19]Come and take a seat.
[30:12.51]Alright, fucking hold on.
[30:15.13]I want to hear it back.
[30:17.13]Hey, so what the fuck's going on here, guys?

[30:26.44]I need to hear what it sounds like.
[30:28.58]Everyone's freaking out.
[30:41.31]Don't clip it.
[30:43.37]What are you talking about?
[30:44.43]Don't clip it clip it.
[30:45.65]I want to hear it.
[30:46.73]I want to hear what this shit sounds like In front of you
[31:08.64]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[31:10.67]That sounds very, very good.
[31:13.35]That sounds very good.
[31:15.03]I'm done.
[31:15.31]I'm done.
[31:15.53]That sounds very good.
[31:16.01]I'm done.
[31:16.25]Let's go.
[31:42.81]Do I have both earphones plugged in?
[31:47.57]That shit sounds very good.
[31:49.58]It sounds clean.
[31:51.10]It sounds beautiful.
[31:53.48]It sounds really good.
[31:54.58]I'm getting fucked with now.
[31:56.74]Everyone's fucking with me.
[31:58.36]And I'm not gonna take it anymore.

[32:03.77]Let's go!
[32:08.03]My nightmares have returned.
[32:15.00]I see.
[32:15.24]This could be a side effect of your treatment.
[32:17.03]Tell me about the dreams.
[32:19.79]Uh, the shadow came after me, right?
[32:29.26]The shadow that entered the room.
[32:30.50]Tell me about it.
[32:32.42]Uh, it wasn't heading toward me.
[32:33.86]It was going toward a machine.
[32:35.18]Yeah.
[32:44.07]It's been 30 minutes.
[32:45.33]I gotta stop.
[32:46.21]Look at over there.
[32:47.96]Perhaps the shadow was the machine's operator.
[32:49.86]Oh, it might have been a scientist, actually.
[32:51.34]The person probably did not wish to hurt you.
[32:57.76]You shouldn't be afraid of them.
[32:58.80]This sounds good.
[32:59.72]Fuck.
[33:02.75]Um, I think maybe you're right.
[33:04.23]Alright, time is up.
[33:11.63]Let me see you.

[35:08.42]Alright, start... Start purging comments of people saying bad audio.
[35:13.00]Don't ban them.
[35:13.68]Just let them know that it's not okay.
[35:16.04]Can I go?
[35:17.76]Wait, what?
[35:18.50]Where are you off to in such a rush?
[35:21.71]Just start purging.
[35:22.99]Don't ban them.

[35:59.51]It's a family heirloom.

[36:17.69]It's that easy.
[36:18.65]Get in.
[36:23.29]Jerma, no matter the audio quality, your streaming personality will always be amazing.
[36:27.70]But you're implying that my audio quality is bad.
[36:31.30]Don't imply that.
[36:42.05]Well... Wait, what can I do with this?
[37:07.29]Wait, I can throw objects.
[37:09.50]Oh shit, that's cool.
[37:21.86]I don't even know what to say anymore.

[39:05.35]That was pretty sick.
[39:15.07]New mic.
[39:16.25]No, new audio device.
[39:18.69]I got it literally two hours ago.
[39:31.31]Yep.
[39:31.69]Well, I fucking missed that one.
[39:42.47]Can I jump out?
[39:42.99]Can I make it through there?
[39:47.13]No.
[39:48.25]Maybe I can.
[39:48.71]Can I make it through there?
[39:49.43]Fuck.
[39:50.39]I can definitely make it through there.
[40:16.97]One more try.
[40:22.49]I can't make it.
[40:23.11]No way.
[40:32.20]What?
[40:32.40]Was somebody else there?
[40:33.06]What?

[41:04.54]Boss?
[41:07.52]I understand why you're here.
[41:10.76]I'm not giving you the satisfaction of killing me.
[41:15.03]Got it.
[41:44.45]Technically got it.
[41:45.24]Yeah, I did.
[41:50.08]You just fucked up the whole thing.
[41:53.24]What?
[41:53.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:53.94]I didn't know that somebody's gonna... I'm looking over at the fucking chat!
[42:09.28]You're an alligator brain dipshit.
[42:11.08]Alligators are one of the smartest goddamn animals in the animal kingdom.
[42:14.26]Just because they're slow and they don't come out of the water doesn't mean they're stupid.
[42:18.64]They're actually pretty intelligent.
[42:34.81]Oh, yeah, he does it anyways.
[42:36.59]Okay.
[42:40.80]Pure alligator instinct.
[42:42.54]That's right.
[42:46.06]Alligators aren't fucking dumb.
[42:48.89]They have like little pea brains, but that doesn't mean they're stupid.
[42:57.23]Yeah, guess what?
[42:58.29]A crow has a little pea brain too.
[43:00.45]And they're seen as one of the smarter animals.
[43:09.19]Oh, that's just one of our guests.
[43:12.43]Well, your guest appears to be soaked in blood.
[43:16.91]How do you explain that?
[43:18.69]It's bath products.
[43:26.68]In that case, you're free to go, sir.
[43:28.30]Well, thanks.
[43:36.60]I hope you enjoyed your shower, sir.
[43:40.84]Is this place called Murderer Tower?
[43:46.32]Your employer is pleased with your results.
[43:48.44]See, you guys said I had the bad ending.
[43:51.58]I got the employer ending.
[43:52.80]You're receiving a new assignment tomorrow.
[44:04.28]I didn't- you ran into me.
[44:05.72]I didn't do anything.
[44:08.54]Hey!
[44:09.50]Watch where you're going!
[44:12.13]I don't know you.
[44:16.84]I'm busy.
[44:21.98]Oh, sorry.
[44:22.88]I'll just leave you alone then.
[44:25.06]Didn't think I could fucking do that with this new device, did you?
[44:26.88]Is this my apartment?
[44:38.10]A grisly scene at the murderer hotel.
[44:39.82]I don't ever do that again.
[44:41.62]I'm not.
[44:44.30]I'm not gonna do that.
[44:45.90]Ever again.
[44:47.43]Gang-related.
[44:47.85]At least 28 dead.
[44:52.13]Among them, eccentric billionaire Josh Rose.
[44:58.91]Who felt his death from the balcony of his penthouse suite.
[45:06.41]so far the police have no that guy's a guy who's a billionaire it's a crutch for people who can't do voices that's why I don't do that highly coordinated large-scale attack citizens are urged to stay indoors in other news want to lose weight fast sanitation worker may have found the answer
[45:38.38]Tune in at 11 to hear the amazing story.
[45:41.62]Let's have some more tea.
[45:48.06]A grisly scene at the mur- Oh, I already did it.
[45:53.43]Go to sleep.
[45:58.49]Why would I say ayaya?
[45:59.37]Because I have to apologize about it.
[46:01.21]Wait, that's the girl that was just in the hallway.
[46:07.97]Um...
[46:14.72]Eight days remain.
[46:18.00]Do it with the voice.
[46:20.30]I'm not going to apologize again.
[46:22.63]You guys.
[46:23.85]I'm unbelievable.
[46:28.33]Unbelievable today.
[46:33.15]I'd like to begin by discussing your sleep habits.
[46:36.58]Has your nightmare reoccurred?
[46:39.86]I feel like I shouldn't tell this person everything.
[46:41.30]How about...
[46:45.21]Sure.
[46:45.67]Last night.
[46:48.41]Oh, I see.
[46:48.77]Tell me what happened in the dream.
[46:50.05]Alright, we both- I get shot.
[46:58.73]Jerma's using the turtle beach microphone.
[47:02.02]Ah, I see.
[47:03.72]He said the scientist would talk to you.
[47:06.98]I couldn't understand him.
[47:09.72]The fucking turtle beach microphone.
[47:14.01]And immediately after he was shot, perhaps he was warning you.
[47:18.21]Hide.
[47:20.63]Hide something.
[47:21.53]They're here.
[47:22.43]Yes, a warning seems most likely.
[47:25.09]I think you're right.
[47:25.69]You know, these dreams may be rooted in a traumatic memory from before your injury.
[47:34.00]What do I mean, injury?
[47:37.80]Near-fatal head trauma you sustained during the war left you debilitated.
[47:43.72]We've worked together ever since, despite your memory loss and distorted perception of time.
[47:49.97]The service medal you carry is an important reminder of your sacrifices and a crucial link to your past life.
[47:56.89]Your recovery has been slow, but tell me, how's your personal life?
[48:00.70]Leapfrog microphone.
[48:01.76]Alright, I'm gonna ban the word microphone.
[48:04.78]Can somebody ban the word microphone in this chat?
[48:10.46]I met someone last night.
[48:12.12]I want all versions of the word mic and microphone to be banned.
[48:18.28]That's quite unusual.
[48:19.06]Tell me about this person.
[48:21.28]Girl, she lives in my building.
[48:25.30]Ah, I wasn't expecting that.
[48:26.25]Who is she?
[48:26.63]She's just a kid.
[48:27.27]We're neighbors.
[48:35.13]Ah, I misinterpreted that meaning.
[48:36.29]This is somewhat relieving.
[48:40.34]You met a child in the third district?
[48:42.10]How strange.
[48:42.90]I don't know what to tell you.
[48:46.28]I take medicine?
[48:49.91]Well, as you know, the third district is not a safe place for children.
[48:54.85]Why?
[48:55.05]Alright, you've been very cooperative today.
[49:00.46]Just a moment.
[49:02.38]What is he injecting me with?
[49:10.70]Well, there's a syringe in this game, which means it gets a full letter grade.
[49:17.74]This has been a productive session.
[49:18.76]We'll continue tomorrow.
[49:20.84]Sure.
[49:30.05]Is there something you're looking for?
[49:31.03]This is probably like a secret government agent or something.
[49:35.51]This is a secret government agent.
[49:37.41]I know what's going on.
[49:42.59]Don't I get a new assignment?
[49:49.78]Popular DJ from upscale second district involved in the trafficking of club drugs.
[49:54.76]Lightly guarded but surrounded by club goers.
[49:57.21]Extreme finesse required to eliminate without detection.
[49:59.93]Pathological liar.
[50:01.17]Do not speak to him.
[50:03.83]We got a huge amount of community subs earlier, and I'm going to go over them all later.
[50:08.14]But nondescript civilian gave 10.
[50:10.66]We did the hype.
[50:12.04]I couldn't even pay attention to the hype thing.
[50:14.62]Just because we were fighting about my mic audio.
[50:19.03]But seriously, that's a fucking lot.
[50:20.29]Thank you, guys.
[50:31.97]Alright, so I have to be careful in here?
[50:41.07]Can I... I can't be seen, I need to be more careful.
[50:46.10]What?
[50:46.36]Can I jump over there?
[50:51.72]Can I jump over their line of sight?
[50:53.94]Wait.

[68:10.36]Your employees are pleased with your results.
[68:16.10]A cleanup crew is on route.
[68:18.66]You will receive your next assignment tomorrow.
[68:21.95]Fuck the cast.
[68:23.49]Hey, look, it's that little girl!
[68:27.77]Microphone, more like micro-penis.
[68:30.73]Ban that person for 10 minutes.
[68:34.25]I mean, I have to start putting my foot down.
[68:37.19]I gotta start putting my foot down somewhere.
[68:39.15]Like, I gotta start putting my foot down as the guy that's driving the ship.
[68:44.90]If it isn't Mr. Too-Busy-To-Talk.
[68:47.38]Oh, what have you, have you been waiting for me?
[68:51.04]You bet I have.
[68:51.78]Behemoth says you're keeping Leviathan in there.
[68:59.62]Roar!
[69:05.97]Now spit it out.
[69:06.65]Where are you hiding Leviathan?
[69:10.27]What are you talking about?
[69:13.65]Spare me the act, Bump.
[69:15.03]Watch this.
[69:18.00]The fuck is that?
[69:18.58]Behemoth only glows when Leviathan's nearby.
[69:20.54]Now open up or he'll kick your butt.
[69:23.34]Is that like a bomb?
[69:24.42]Get it out of here!
[69:27.68]Let us in!
[69:28.24]Okay, come in.
[69:31.96]Nice.
[69:34.00]I told you he'd be a pushover, Behemoth.
[69:36.80]But the thing was beeping red.
[69:38.52]It was going like... What do you want me to do?
[69:42.92]Alright, let's go.
[69:43.36]Come on inside.
[69:44.54]He's a pushover.
[69:45.51]I'm not a...
[69:48.58]What a dump.
[69:49.34]No wonder you didn't want me to come in.
[69:56.20]Here.
[69:57.03]You take Behemoth.
[69:57.71]He'll glow the closer you get.
[69:59.15]Closer I get to what?
[70:08.17]You want some tea?
[70:18.22]There's nothing but fish heads.
[70:20.52]Just boil them.
[70:23.28]Boil them.
[70:25.34]Use the broth.
[70:26.80]And, I don't know, put a few onions in it.
[70:28.54]And, I don't know.
[70:29.17]What do you mean, what the fuck?
[70:33.33]What the fuck?
[70:33.87]What are you talking about?
[70:35.15]Boil them.
[70:35.51]Let's search the counter.
[70:38.85]Nothing.
[70:43.10]Nothing.
[70:46.16]Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
[70:48.36]Speaking of which, I'm glad you brought that up.
[70:50.90]Because tomorrow, tomorrow we are going to be starting the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring for PlayStation 2.
[71:03.44]It's a very important stream.
[71:04.84]I hope you're there.
[71:05.94]Because somebody told me that they guaranteed I would not beat the first level.
[71:09.72]They guaranteed it.
[71:15.53]So, we're gonna see.
[71:21.64]I don't know why.
[71:22.26]I don't understand.
[71:23.18]I don't... I... It's not wrong.
[71:26.94]You can't guarantee something, okay?
[71:30.20]A guarantee?
[71:33.22]It's a Lord of the Rings tie-in movie PlayStation 2 game.
[71:37.02]Now, the two... By the way, I have Two Towers and I have Return of the King.
[71:39.75]Two Towers is one of the best video games ever made.
[71:42.75]I'm rose-colored glasses, I know.
[71:45.17]But the Two Towers is probably one of the best PlayStation 2 games that ever existed.
[71:54.37]Did she just stay here now?
[72:04.78]What the... What the hell was that?
[72:10.89]See?
[72:11.99]I knew it.
[72:13.07]You had them all along.
[72:16.34]I don't know what this is.
[72:17.24]Oh, it's another dinosaur.
[72:21.28]Hello, Leviathan.
[72:25.22]Roar.
[72:25.58]They sound pretty scary.
[72:29.13]They sound pretty scary.
[72:30.07]Yeah, you gotta... You know, that's just me, right?
[72:34.99]They're just toys.
[72:35.79]They can't talk.
[72:36.61]Jeez.
[72:38.61]well yeah I'm alright I gotta go you can keep leviathan for now but if you're nice to him if you're not nice to him me and behemoth are gonna kick your butt bye in other news no leads yet on the murder of underground dj electro head
[73:03.92]who suffered a fatal knife wound while performing at a local nightclub, Club Neon.
[73:11.97]The killing triggered a stampede, leaving dozens of clubgoers injured or dead.
[73:16.29]Did I do that?
[73:18.91]No amount of compression is going to save me from that.
[73:24.89]Those of you thinking that you're not going to hear those anymore.
[73:28.18]Despite this, Club Neon manager Sterling Silver says the show must go on.
[73:35.50]That was a high def compressed vroom.
[73:38.58]I can't believe I spent fucking 30 minutes self-consciously trying to fix my audio.
[73:49.04]I had it in a spot I already knew.
[73:52.39]I can't believe.
[73:58.55]And you failed.
[73:59.21]No, I was trying to make you guys think it was down and good.
[74:04.44]I thought I was gonna turn the stream- Let's go over re- like, in my brain- By the way, I had a dream last night that I was naked on stream.
[74:10.38]Let's go over this.
[74:11.88]I had a dream that, like, I- I was- Alright, this is gonna be fucking crazy.
[74:16.54]I was streaming in a bathtub.
[74:18.76]And I don't know why the camera was on the bath while I was in the bathtub.
[74:23.93]And we were just talking.
[74:25.35]And I stood up and just, like, naked- Like, I was just naked in the camera.
[74:29.47]And I freaked out.
[74:30.09]I was like, oh, fuck, right, I forgot.
[74:33.03]And then-
[74:35.44]Uh, the VOD was... Later on, I was like, oh, it's not... Whatever, it's not a big deal.
[74:39.08]The VOD was deleted later, and I didn't do it.
[74:41.31]I was like, who deleted this VOD?
[74:43.73]I must be banned.
[74:45.21]And one of my mods deleted it.
[74:47.99]And they were like, no, I deleted it.
[74:49.05]It's alright.
[74:49.53]And I was like, what?
[74:51.13]Like, yeah, I deleted the VOD for you.
[74:52.35]I was like, oh, shit.
[74:53.85]I have to read this.
[74:54.65]Our doors will be open again soon as mop up the visceral.
[75:00.22]In other news... No, no, I already read this.
[75:01.44]I already read this.
[75:03.35]A bridge collapsed in the third district.
[75:05.21]Okay, let's go to bed.
[75:07.35]So yeah, one of my mods deleted the... Which mod?
[75:11.52]I don't know.
[75:14.40]It was just like mod, just mod.
[75:18.88]But I was going, oh man.
[75:20.96]Okay, so what I... Did nobody see it?
[75:24.56]And apparently no one saw...
[75:27.44]my, like, naked body.
[75:29.64]Nobody saw, and everybody did, but nobody was, I went, we went back, and, like, I looked at, like, a clip of it happening.
[75:35.04]Hold on.
[75:42.57]What the fuck?
[75:52.02]Okay.
[75:52.76]Seven days remain.
[75:53.46]Anyways.
[75:55.40]So... The- the moment where I stand up and, like, my... Full lower body naked into the camera.
[76:03.49]No- in the chat, you know when you can see the Twitch chat?
[76:06.65]The VOD on and clips and shit?
[76:08.65]No one said anything.
[76:09.71]I think only one person.
[76:12.42]One person.
[76:14.26]They were not a sub.
[76:15.44]They were not, like, a- You know, like, when somebody's not subbed to the channel, it's just, like, their name?
[76:21.58]There's no bits or anything.
[76:22.44]It was just, like, the text.
[76:23.68]It just said... Penis.
[76:26.74]And that was it.
[76:27.66]And I saw, I was like, wait, nobody noticed?
[76:29.74]That one person did, though.
[76:30.88]And I woke up.
[76:42.16]And I was like, how did nobody see that one person noticed?
[76:52.73]Do you see your chat in your dream?
[76:54.05]Alright, we have to go back to this.
[76:55.78]What?
[76:55.90]Did you speak to Electrohead?
[76:56.50]I specifically told you not to speak to Electrohead!
[77:21.31]Shut up.
[77:22.77]What did he say?
[77:24.57]Why didn't you want... He told me... Why didn't you want me to know?
[77:30.40]Our superiors don't want to risk exposing you to anything that could potentially compromise our goals.
[77:36.52]As a veteran, you should understand that you're not privy to the full details of our mission.
[77:44.62]What the... What is... What's the mission?
[77:47.58]Your memory lapses are beginning to concern me.
[77:51.90]We're working to end illegal drug trafficking in the third district.
[77:57.25]When this is over, you may return to a normal life.
[78:01.25]What?
[78:03.29]I'd like it too, but it will require strict compliance to your orders.
[78:08.15]There can be no more hiccups.
[78:13.71]Um... Alright, I... Does my precondition come from the drugs?
[78:21.40]Well, yes, it does.
[78:22.10]Your precondition is a side effect of the drug.
[78:25.46]That is why we cannot allow others to abuse it.
[78:27.69]Alright, I... I don't want this.
[78:33.35]It's a shame that you can't grasp the power you've been bestowed.
[78:35.89]But if that's how you really truly feel, we can taper you off once the mission is complete.
[78:39.86]Uh, I don't... Wait, is that going to take my power away?
[78:44.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[78:45.84]This is hard mode.
[78:48.16]I understand.
[78:53.52]It's time for your medicine.
[78:54.50]Okay, yeah, this is a hard one.
[78:57.08]If they stop giving me the medicine, I can't do the slow-mo anymore, right?
[78:59.72]Something like that?
[79:08.11]Anyone have a clip of Jerma showing his dick the other night?
[79:10.39]I need it for community content night.
[79:20.76]Imagine making a community content night video.
[79:25.98]Ayayay.
[79:26.36]I'm called the dragon.
[79:28.28]You don't want me to be called the dragon.
[79:30.05]Say ayayay.
[79:30.49]Show ads.
[79:54.40]No, I don't... I'm never showing an ad ever again.
[79:58.45]For any reason.
[79:59.85]Ever.
[80:02.57]Never.
[80:06.83]No, absolutely not.
[80:07.89]Ever again.
[80:08.55]I can't... I'm not... Guys, there's like 11,000 subs on this channel.
[80:11.89]I'm never gonna run an ad.
[80:14.44]Never, ever.
[80:15.40]Ever.
[80:16.44]Like, I never did, but why... I'm gonna start running ads?
[80:22.83]Hey, you know, we just crossed 11,000 subs.
[80:26.49]We start running an ad every 20 minutes.
[80:30.35]What?
[80:31.23]No?
[80:37.61]Political dissident and leaker of redacted.
[80:41.03]Scheduled to testify in military tribunal.
[80:42.88]Target must be eliminated post haste.
[80:44.98]Collateral damage is unacceptable.
[80:47.18]Stealth and covert action are necessary to prevent additional loss.
[80:49.26]Okay, let's go.
[80:56.50]Hello?
[80:57.92]I want to reiterate, as per your dossier, that your target in this mission is Fa Yuan.
[81:02.78]Others must not be harmed.
[81:05.42]What if I don't have a choice?
[81:06.18]What if I'm being attacked or something?
[81:09.32]This is simple trying to let that happen.
[81:11.81]Okay, whatever.
[81:14.49]Do an ad reveal at 100 subs.
[81:19.43]Here we go.
[81:30.07]I like this one.
[81:32.22]This is a good one.
[81:41.20]I killed that person.
[81:42.56]Why did his head come off?
[81:44.70]What?
[81:47.46]Oh.
[81:55.17]Wait.
[82:00.60]Well, did they think I did this?
[82:02.84]I didn't do this.
[82:07.78]Oh, that's a true, that's a true monkaOMEGA.
[82:17.70]I didn't do this, though.
[82:18.42]It's probably like another katana.
[82:19.82]Katana 1 is somewhere.
[82:24.16]Alright, this is gonna be like a proto man mega man kind of scenario Or is that like am I thinking too much into that?
[82:46.20]I can hide in here.
[82:46.88]Okay, but why do I need to hide?
[82:54.84]You must show your ass.
[82:56.62]Have you devolved?
[82:58.48]How much have you devolved?
[83:00.42]I wonder.
[83:02.66]Have you devolved already?
[83:04.55]You've devolved?
[83:09.01]Drink from the fountain?
[83:11.65]It's Fa Yuan.
[83:12.85]His body is still warm.
[83:16.09]Oh.
[83:18.23]Dragon, we have you surrounded!
[83:21.05]Surrender or we will respond with maximum force!
[83:28.72]Great.
[83:34.02]Don't kill anybody, right?
[83:36.34]Wait till he turns.
[83:38.22]Wait till he lands.
[83:43.17]Holy fuck!
[83:44.45]Wait, okay.
[83:51.37]I can't go in anywhere.
[83:55.01]Alright, let me see how... He goes all the way down there.
[83:59.42]I can just drop down.
[84:00.08]Okay, I can drop down.
[84:00.68]Dude, I'm not going to kill anybody.
[84:04.24]I promise.
[84:05.77]I'm not going to kill anybody.
[84:17.40]Do they know I'm in here?
[84:30.32]They can hear you.
[84:31.10]It's alright.
[84:32.32]I can do it.
[84:41.38]Oh, he came in there with me.
[84:43.00]Okay.
[84:49.08]If you get spotted, you need to kill them to leave the room.
[84:51.08]Really?
[84:51.44]Oh, fuck.
[84:58.67]Is that for real?
[85:05.94]Somebody died.
[85:06.50]Whatever.
[85:20.35]Yes, that should work.
[85:21.31]Video feed lost.
[85:24.97]You promised.
[85:25.70]I...
[85:37.96]Does that kill them?
[85:40.14]Alright.
[85:41.08]It's over at this point.
[85:41.90]They're all dead.
[85:46.88]What a liar.
[85:48.00]I'm not... What do you want me to do?
[85:59.63]Did you walk the whole way?
[86:01.79]Jesus, man.
[86:02.49]You're walking the entire way.
[86:07.33]Video feed lost.
[86:17.19]Breaking promises.
[86:23.06]He's doing a genocide run.
[86:24.34]No, he's not.
[86:24.92]No, he's not.
[86:26.72]He only killed three people.
[86:29.16]Because he had to.
[86:48.80]Okay.
[86:53.03]Nice going.
[86:53.55]I can hide in this room.
[86:55.13]But how long do I have to hide in here for?

[87:00.70]Two.
[87:01.58]Three.

[87:42.08]Can I dodge through him?
[87:42.92]Will he see me if I dodge through him?
[87:52.12]He's gonna hear me.

[87:56.25]Well, that would... I didn't know... I didn't have that info before.
[87:59.57]Now I do.
[88:00.31]Maybe it told me and I wasn't looking.

[88:23.98]I went through the entire game not knowing you could do that.
[88:27.64]Really?
[88:32.32]They're upset that not all terms of the contract were met.
[88:37.27]The collateral damage of the police has been deemed unacceptable.

[90:49.96]Some guy with dumb hair.

[91:12.74]I thought I was being deep and it was just an Ed, Edd, and Eddie quote.
[91:21.90]Oh, God damn it.
[91:22.68]Yeah, I was trying to be like, wow, listen to me.
[91:25.22]Listen to how fucking smart I am and how caring I am.

[94:16.03]Maybe you're not such a party animal after all.
[94:21.96]Then maybe you shouldn't place music so fucking loud all the time.
[94:29.12]Hey, it's not me you need to apologize to.

[103:01.62]Oh, well that's what that does!
[103:02.92]It's smoke!
[103:03.98]Would you look at that?
[103:04.94]It's smoke!

[103:11.71]Okay, I figured it out.
[103:19.65]Can I go in here?

[104:10.72]Oh, fuck!
[104:14.34]Say you're sorry.
[104:14.98]I didn't do anything!
[104:27.09]It was because you didn't do ads.
[104:28.49]Oh, okay.
[104:34.47]It's out.

[106:36.71]Yikes!
[106:37.13]That was... Oh!

[108:27.63]Watch out for the turtle this time.
[108:35.17]That's what happened.
[108:35.71]Alright, I was gonna say, what the fuck?
[108:41.96]Alright, got a yellow keycard.
[108:52.20]I almost have them all.
[108:52.86]One more room.
[108:58.73]How's the audio?
[109:01.20]I shouldn't have even said anything.
[109:03.00]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[109:04.42]Oh my god.
[109:05.56]I really am a fucking moron.
[109:08.20]Why would I even say anything?
[109:13.04]We were all just relaxed.
[109:14.28]Nobody would say anything and I just brought it back.
[109:21.49]Chapel of Doom.
[109:29.97]Wait, is Donkey Kong Country?
[109:35.09]It is Donkey Kong Country.
[109:37.63]What?
[109:38.13]How do I... Oh, I have to jump over it.
[109:39.21]Okay.
[109:45.72]That's some suspicious masochism.
[109:55.68]Shoot!
[109:57.77]Yeah!
[109:58.57]You know you wanted to shoot me.
[110:13.78]Keep going.
[110:15.98]Ooh, you have a gun.
[110:20.35]Shoot.
[110:21.23]Goodbye.
[110:21.63]I have to shoot.
[110:24.77]Oh god, I have to get down.
[110:27.65]Is this doable anymore?
[110:29.35]I died because there's no minecart.
[110:31.69]Okay.
[110:37.40]What did I just jump into?
[110:38.10]Did I jump into his fist?
[110:45.00]I was supposed to jump down.
[110:47.69]Get out of the cart.
[110:51.11]Imagine streaming from your bathtub.
[111:00.13]I know.
[111:02.03]I gotta get... How do I do this?
[111:03.35]Am I... Okay, I did it.
[111:07.00]I did it.
[111:15.03]No?
[111:15.25]What?
[111:15.59]What do I do?
[111:15.98]I have to go up to the... Ah, fuck.
[111:18.18]Alright, we're fine.
[111:36.89]Who's up?
[111:40.65]You.
[111:41.19]Who else?
[111:41.75]Somebody with a gun?
[111:46.06]No, we're good.
[111:47.34]G-Cart.
[111:51.06]That should work.
[111:52.90]Imagine streaming for your best.
[111:54.90]I know.
[111:56.56]Okay, the best part about that dream, seriously, is... I, like, I'm gonna turn on my webcam and set up an elaborate setup to stream, not only stream naked, like actually in the bath.
[112:12.06]With the camera pointing down at a level where it could... Why would I ever do something like that?
[112:16.08]It doesn't make any sense.
[112:19.12]If that would ever actually happen, I would wear, like, three layers of undergarments, and wear a pair of shorts, and tape the bottoms of the shorts.
[112:28.25]With, like, duct tape.
[112:29.55]Like... So it would be impossible. ...
[112:46.14]Put the cards in.
[112:51.31]Yeah, I would... What would the bathtub even be for?
[112:56.03]Why would I be in the bathtub?
[113:01.25]Watch this.
[113:02.29]Watch out.
[113:05.41]Whoops.
[113:16.89]That's all I want you to do!
[113:19.71]Gun!
[113:19.99]Gun!
[113:20.61]Gun!
[113:35.34]Shit.
[113:38.04]Randomly just do that one day?
[113:41.03]What the fuck just happened?
[113:41.69]I tried to throw it.
[113:48.97]I'm not gonna do this one.
[113:49.67]I'm going up here.
[113:56.80]There's a lot of guns over that way.
[114:20.56]Okay, good.
[114:21.30]They're coming up.
[114:21.66]They're coming up.
[114:22.18]Down.
[114:23.82]Oh, my God.
[114:24.14]Oh, my God.
[114:24.46]Oh, my God.
[114:24.74]Oh, my God.
[114:25.00]Oh, my God.
[114:25.38]Okay.
[114:26.42]Okay, they can't... He's gonna see me.
[114:36.37]This is not ideal.
[114:37.61]Not ideal.
[114:40.57]This is incredibly not ideal.
[114:43.81]I think it's possible, though.
[114:44.57]Holy fuck.
[115:08.09]Is he okay?
[115:08.67]I'm alright.
[115:10.57]I'm going to McDonald's.
[115:11.23]You want anything?
[115:11.85]Yeah, get me a fucking Big Mac meal.
[115:17.25]Get over here.
[115:17.69]I don't want to stain my fresh tracksuit.
[115:22.68]Get out.
[115:23.38]This is business.
[115:30.36]Well, let's do this.
[115:33.98]That was... I'm dead.
[115:34.72]Okay.
[115:35.24]Okay.
[115:42.38]Okay, he's... This guy, he's gonna keep shooting.
[115:53.80]Okay, so I can't... Don't swing at him.
[115:55.18]Just hit his bullets back.
[115:58.96]Okay, um, I don't understand.
[116:09.14]He throws me, and then he pulls the gun out and shoots, and I can't get him deflected.
[116:21.06]Oh, okay.
[116:34.81]So if he throws you, then you have to slow down time and... Oh my god, what the fuck?
[116:38.57]I don't understand.
[116:41.93]That's not fair.
[116:43.10]Why is he doing this?
[116:43.74]What the fuck?
[116:47.52]Okay.
[116:48.38]Okay.
[116:53.79]Is this all?
[116:54.27]What a waste.
[116:58.47]That'll... Hmm.
[117:01.82]Shrink... I couldn't even say it.
[117:05.40]I've never approved of your pet projects.
[117:07.86]Shrinkage.
[117:08.62]I... Shrinkage.
[117:12.78]I'll go home now and forget all about this.
[117:14.12]This is your only warning.
[117:17.61]What a fucking waste.
[117:19.45]Let's get out of here.
[117:22.07]Yes, let's.
[117:25.90]Do not mistake my mercy for weakness.
[117:36.15]Okay.
[117:36.41]We're getting another image here.
[117:40.77]Yes, I did that.
[117:41.65]I know I did that.
[117:42.37]But I'm in a full pair of jeans.
[117:45.26]I've rescheduled your appointment for tomorrow.
[117:47.80]I hope you had a relaxing night.
[117:54.50]I'm in a full pair of jeans right there.
[117:56.32]You know what I mean?
[118:01.33]Have your children trick-or-treat in your building only.
[118:08.39]Don't accept candy from anyone you don't know and don't accept strange or discolored candy.
[118:12.43]That's good advice.
[118:16.21]Who's knocking at the door?
[118:22.53]Trick or treat.
[118:24.91]Oh.
[118:25.79]Are you dressed like me?
[118:26.67]You're dressed like me.
[118:29.87]I knew you'd recognize me.
[118:30.81]You wear the same thing every day.
[118:32.25]Happy Halloween.
[118:33.18]Trick or treat.
[118:36.58]What?
[118:37.78]I don't know what trick or treat means.
[118:40.40]Trick or treat.
[118:41.24]Trick or treat.
[118:41.84]You're supposed to give me candy now.
[118:43.30]Alright.
[118:45.01]Let me see if I have any.
[118:46.19]Let's check.
[118:46.53]Okay.
[118:48.59]Okay.
[118:58.35]A fish head.
[119:03.81]Oh, wow.
[119:06.45]Tell Leviathan I said hello.
[119:07.77]Happy Halloween.
[119:08.62]That's pretty fucked up.
[119:11.16]I just gave a small child a cut-off fish head for Halloween.
[119:14.22]At least we confirmed the recent killings at Mutual High Security Prison, which left over 20 dead, including political dissident Yuan.
[119:26.77]Didn't even boil it first.

[121:41.26]Now scram!
[121:53.41]Alright, I'm awake.
[121:55.82]In four days.
[121:59.52]So tell me again about the men in masks.
[122:03.40]What?
[122:05.44]The masked men from your dream.
[122:08.04]What the hell is happening?
[122:09.10]Did I just wake up here?
[122:10.75]When did I get here?
[122:15.21]Uh... What is happening?
[122:19.41]What am I doing here?
[122:21.31]Mm-hmm.
[122:23.95]It felt so real.
[122:24.63]I couldn't move my body.
[122:25.65]Alright.
[122:27.33]You piece of shit!
[122:29.75]What?
[122:35.85]Well, I don't understand.
[122:37.27]Get up.
[122:40.77]Get the fuck up.
[122:45.23]Uh... Okay.
[122:59.53]Do I not?
[123:00.25]Am I doing... What if I just don't move?
[123:03.53]Okay.
[123:04.62]That's... Ripped graphics card.
[123:08.16]28 years in that godforsaken jungle.
[123:11.44]What?
[123:12.90]Killing soldiers wasn't so bad.
[123:14.12]I hardly remember it.
[123:19.51]But burning those villages, watching those naked peasants cry...
[123:27.17]I see it every day.
[123:28.79]It's not the PTSD, it's the drug.
[123:34.51]It's only been a week, but it feels like a year.
[123:41.80]Every word is getting longer, the mosquitoes are getting louder.
[123:49.62]When the drug runs out, time stops and you're stuck in the jungle forever.
[123:56.02]It's getting bright.
[123:57.00]It's grains of sand and a shrinking hourglass.
[124:04.14]I know what comes next.
[124:04.84]I need to ask you a favor.
[124:08.89]Everybody's spam.
[124:09.75]I know... Minus 684 days.
[124:15.67]Hey, Papa needs his medicine.
[124:17.35]Help out an old vet.
[124:18.29]I killed six chromage fosters in the war.
[124:23.60]Am I that person?
[124:26.22]It's only been a day since his last taste.
[124:27.64]How can this be?
[124:30.02]The drink is all this man ever was, and when it is gone, what remains is the bottle.
[124:33.48]Pathetic.
[124:36.12]Absolutely pathetic.
[124:36.96]Let's just keep walking and try not to make eye contact.
[124:41.20]Please help me.
[124:41.82]Anything.
[124:52.03]Your thousand yard stare does not instill me with confidence.
[124:56.31]I've increased your dosage to compensate for yesterday.
[124:58.39]Please keep in mind everything we've spoken about today.
[125:03.22]Okay.
[125:08.98]Oh, do you like it?
[125:09.61]It's a traditional healing stone my daughter brought back from Burundi.
[125:15.05]It makes a fine paperweight.
[125:21.11]Why can't I see emotes like MonkaS?
[125:23.77]You need to have better twitch.tv to see MonkaS.
[125:27.92]It's an add-on?
[125:31.58]Let's take a look.
[125:33.36]Al Qasim.
[125:35.10]Receive a caution.
[125:48.87]Wait, is MonkaS part of Twitch now or no?
[125:50.45]I don't think it is.
[125:55.45]Mansion hideout.
[125:56.26]Here we go.
[126:03.50]Shit.
[126:04.00]I wonder if MonkaS will get the LUL.
[126:06.32]And it'll just be part of Twitch at some point.
[126:07.92]It's like everybody uses it.
[126:09.16]Everybody.
[126:16.31]That was bad.
[126:26.98]That was really bad.
[126:33.15]Frighten the face.
[126:34.17]Watch this jump.
[126:40.21]Didn't Pepe... Wait, what?
[126:46.44]Down!
[126:46.90]If you read my blue, thou shall be cursed with a... I don't even know what that means.
[126:52.66]Wait, what?
[126:53.92]And yank it through the hole in the back.
[126:55.61]What are they saying?
[126:57.65]No boss.
[126:58.15]I read about it in Regional Geographic.
[127:02.32]How about you shut the fuck up when I'm telling you a story?
[127:07.08]Sorry.
[127:09.34]I guess that would make... Don't move muscle.
[127:16.88]Jesus, it's you.
[127:18.24]Are you fucking following me again?
[127:19.58]No more loose ends.
[127:26.67]Well, he did it.
[127:30.02]Don't move a monster, Laura.
[127:33.60]Don't move a monster, Laura.
[127:49.51]Let's go.
[127:51.87]Wait, should I go over there?
[127:57.76]Can I follow him in this room?
[127:59.68]No.
[128:04.08]Turn the toons up?
[128:04.86]You want me to turn up the toons?
[128:08.90]You got it.
[128:11.89]Wait.
[128:17.27]There you go.
[128:18.71]Turn up the toons.
[128:22.75]Why is it doing this?
[128:29.65]Alright.
[128:38.31]Okay, I was gonna say, what?
[128:42.11]That should work.
[128:42.63]Alright, turn up the tune!
[128:46.47]Oh, this is where I was before when it was doing all that weird shit.
[128:55.21]Bum bum bum bum bum.
[128:58.53]You're not gonna get me with that.
[128:59.95]Sorry.
[129:03.27]Oh, please.
[129:03.97]Just break it.
[129:05.11]Fine.
[129:05.31]Go down.
[129:15.18]That should work.
[129:18.64]Oh, my God.
[129:19.04]MonkaS lights out.
[129:27.95]Damn it, I tried to swing down.
[129:33.73]Whoa, he just... Did he just butt me with that shit?
[129:37.46]Oops.
[129:41.92]Okay, he's buttoned.
[129:50.70]What is this?
[129:51.18]Is that a flamethrower?
[129:53.29]How do I use it?
[129:58.11]What?
[129:59.65]This beat?
[130:00.21]I don't get it.
[130:00.91]What should I use this for?
[130:08.00]Who's that?
[130:10.28]It's for the flames.
[130:15.59]Fuck!
[130:16.23]I'm trying to be fancy.
[130:29.81]Okay, let's go.
[130:35.61]Ah, I see there's oil right there.
[130:36.68]I got it.
[130:43.20]How close can I get to this?
[130:45.24]Oh, fuck.
[130:45.80]Okay, I did it.
[130:56.05]I need that link, I need that link.
[130:58.05]No!
[130:59.23]Stop spamming links or you're gonna be- you're gonna get arrested.
[131:02.93]What is it?
[131:11.17]What is it?
[131:11.45]I don't- I can't see anything.
[131:12.23]I don't- what is it?
[131:20.99]It's a fucking ear of corn.
[131:22.34]Why are you linking me an ear of corn?
[131:29.21]Why are you linking this to me?
[131:34.32]I don't understand.
[131:35.48]It's the wrong link.
[131:36.28]I can't... I don't... I can't even... I can't open this link!
[131:43.50]I can't open this!
[131:46.02]You just scared the fuck out of me.
[131:47.00]I was like, wait, that's not real.
[131:48.37]That's... Anything can be edited.
[131:54.51]Anything can be edited.
[131:55.51]Anything.
[131:57.45]Once you understand that, you understand...
[132:18.89]Anything can be edited.
[132:21.85]Anything.
[132:29.56]Everything is editable.
[132:49.59]Whoa!
[132:49.89]I didn't mean to do that.
[132:50.45]Okay, I gotta slow down.
[133:01.44]Alright.
[133:01.80]Fucking what am I doing?
[133:08.74]I gotta bring everybody down here.
[133:09.72]Or at least most of them.
[133:14.81]Actually, there's a lot of people in there.
[133:19.29]What's that guy doing?
[133:19.85]I don't know.
[133:30.89]Oh, fuck!
[133:32.29]Okay, he's... What was he doing?
[133:47.42]Where's he going?
[133:49.24]How did these guys not die?
[133:52.12]What?
[133:52.32]Can you say every word in the dictionary to teach my AI your voice?
[134:04.90]No, I'm not doing... I'm not... No.
[134:11.60]Say every word in the... That wouldn't even be AI.
[134:14.34]That would just be you have me saying every single word.
[134:19.61]You wouldn't need AI.
[134:20.55]You'd have just pieced words together.
[134:31.89]I think we've already brought this up before.
[134:33.50]I've streamed and made videos for a decade.
[134:46.77]Get up.
[134:48.07]I'm up.
[134:50.08]Good.
[134:53.26]I expected more out of the infamous dragon.
[134:55.58]Didn't think I looked up to you.
[134:59.51]Well, any last words?
[135:05.67]Good one.
[135:06.53]Now it's my turn.
[135:09.17]Mr. Kissyface cut off his head, put the body in cement.
[135:14.36]Sure thing, V.
[135:23.79]Get the fuck up.
[135:24.83]My head.
[135:27.03]Your head, huh?
[135:30.25]I expected more out of the dragon.
[135:31.47]I looked up to you.
[135:33.15]Fuck you.
[135:34.53]Fuck you too.
[135:36.27]Mr. Kissyface cut his head off and put the body in cement.
[135:39.50]Sure thing, V. Get off!
[135:47.92]Ow, my head.
[135:49.12]Your head, huh?
[135:51.26]I expected more out of the dragon.
[135:53.38]Fuck you.
[135:54.88]Fuck you too.
[135:56.68]Mr. Kissyface cut off his head and put it in a bag.
[135:59.90]Sure thing.
[136:07.27]Get up!
[136:08.45]I'm up.
[136:10.61]Good.
[136:13.11]I expected more out of the infamous dragon to think I looked up to you.
[136:17.23]Well, any last words?
[136:19.25]I want answers.
[136:21.65]Uh...
[136:22.86]I never told you my name.
[136:26.17]You should probably cut his tongue out.
[136:31.25]What a waste of fucking time.
[136:32.93]I'm gonna be late for my date.
[136:34.95]I bet she's ugly.
[136:38.19]Shut the fuck up.
[136:44.99]I get a lot of chances here.
[136:46.77]I'm up.
[136:49.09]Good.
[136:52.03]I expected more.
[136:53.93]Okay, any last words?
[136:55.75]Don't be late for your date, V. What?
[137:01.38]Haha, you sneaky bastard.
[137:04.06]You're not here for the Kronos.
[137:05.74]You're already on it.
[137:09.16]I knew it.
[137:10.92]I knew it.
[137:11.46]How many times have I killed you?
[137:14.22]Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[137:19.59]He's on Chronos, that perk up your fucking ears?
[137:27.35]Now you wanna talk?
[137:28.59]Now you wanna tell us how to make it?
[137:32.63]Well, fucking talk.
[137:39.08]You're not gonna get anything if you don't- I think you broke his ribs.
[137:41.88]You're not gonna get information if you do that.
[137:44.82]You're just gonna kill him.
[137:48.00]These guys don't talk.
[137:51.29]You will, though.
[137:52.67]I know your game now.
[137:55.77]Listen, I have reservations in the second district, and I'm not going to be late because of a goddamn Kronos junkie.
[138:04.79]Now tell me who supplies you so I can end your miserable life and get on with my night.
[138:11.95]Uh... My psych... What is Kronos?
[138:16.61]Huh.
[138:18.33]Ah!
[138:20.43]You don't even know what Kronos is?
[138:22.77]You're on Kronos, kissy face!
[138:24.79]Watch this!
[138:29.23]Ah!
[138:29.85]Not so fucking fast now!
[138:31.15]Kissy face, put the dragon near Al-Qasim.
[138:34.41]When we burn the place down, people will think he was looking for drugs or something.
[138:40.26]What?
[138:40.60]You're still alive?
[138:41.64]Whatever, man.
[138:42.86]You're probably just gonna go back and change this anyway.
[138:49.78]Get out.
[138:51.70]Get the fuck up.
[138:52.40]I'm not here for Kronos.
[138:53.41]I'm on it.
[138:53.93]Don't miss your date, V. What the fuck?
[139:02.41]Start talking now.
[139:03.33]Who sent you?
[139:06.39]My psychiatrist sent me.
[139:08.83]Yeah?
[139:09.85]You shrink?
[139:10.47]Kissy face.
[139:11.03]Kill him.
[139:11.73]And throw the dragon's body when we're done.
[139:15.19]Heh.
[139:23.04]I'm not here.
[139:24.16]Don't miss your date.
[139:24.78]I'm on Kronos.
[139:25.68]I'm on it.
[139:26.42]I'm on it.
[139:26.78]I'm on it.
[139:27.06]I'm on it.
[139:28.38]What the fuck?
[139:31.20]Start talking now.
[139:31.84]Your tape sucked.
[139:34.84]You thought you... I can't believe you... I need to find my fucking thing unplugged.
[139:48.67]I'm on Kronos.

[140:27.69]He's just trying to get under your skin, V. Shut the fuck up.
[140:33.66]I'm tied up and you still want my approval?
[140:36.60]Fuck, fuck!
[140:38.54]Hey!
[140:39.64]That was the... Ask Al-Qassim who's... He hadn't talked yet.
[140:46.66]Ask fucking Al-Qassim who's a bitch.
[140:48.34]Fucking ask him.
[140:52.82]I'm not in the mood for this shit.
[140:54.70]You handle this one, Mr. Kissy Face.
[140:56.38]Tell the boss Al-Qassim was dead when we got here.
[141:01.78]Say what again?
[141:02.92]Say what again?
[141:03.86]I double dare you!
[141:08.88]Hey guys, check this out.
[141:15.70]Hey guys, check this out.
[141:25.24]What?
[141:25.44]I don't have a weapon?
[141:26.12]I don't have a weapon.
[141:31.64]Oops, wrong guy.
[141:32.60]Ow.
[141:42.27]There's nothing I...
[141:54.77]I had to dodge alright I got it got it kill yeah good now we can have some fun hold what do you mean hold what I don't understand what do you mean hold
[142:29.60]What's he doing?
[142:33.45]Wait, wait.
[142:36.63]What?
[142:37.03]Hold on.
[142:38.95]Alright, yeah, it's like, okay, I got it, I got it.
[142:54.92]That didn't hit him?
[142:55.58]Dead.
[143:01.49]Alright, here comes this thing.
[143:02.27]Spins it around.
[143:04.88]Walks.
[143:05.46]Go around him.
[143:19.41]Got it.
[143:20.99]Yeah.
[143:21.97]See you later.
[143:28.77]Was I supposed to do that?
[143:30.35]Was I supposed to do that?
[143:30.93]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[143:33.83]Okay, let's go.
[143:37.75]Kissy face.
[143:38.89]You weren't able to find the Kronos, were you?
[143:42.53]He wasn't talking.
[143:43.33]I think he knew who sent us.
[143:47.39]The boss isn't going to believe Al-Qasim was dead when we got here.
[143:50.57]You're making me look very unprofessional.
[143:53.89]He wasn't saying anything anyway.
[143:56.55]These investor guys don't really know anything about manufacturing Kronos.
[144:01.82]We need to look for scientists.
[144:05.76]Maybe you shouldn't blow off their heads.
[144:09.08]He wasn't talking either.
[144:11.34]Something's... I don't know what to do with you.
[144:14.25]I'm fucking... I can't even read.
[144:17.05]Still, it is somewhat impressive that you were able to eliminate the swordsman.
[144:20.75]The boss might be able to overlook your murderous tendencies for it.
[144:26.70]It was no big deal.
[144:30.06]Yes, it was.
[144:31.00]I saw his handiwork at Studio 51.
[144:32.92]He killed dozens of men effortlessly and dispassionately.
[144:36.52]He was ready for battle almost before I came at him.
[144:39.66]Not a big deal.
[144:40.86]There was nothing behind those eyes.
[144:42.16]No soul, no remorse.
[144:43.30]He didn't care about his mission, or the people he killed, or even himself.
[144:46.66]Why are these all highlighted?
[144:50.32]Is there something with this?
[144:51.10]I know I'm hard on you sometimes, but I'm proud of you.
[144:54.18]The dragon was no ordinary null.
[145:00.02]Geez, Snow.
[145:02.16]Think the boss is going to give me a reward?
[145:05.86]Probably.
[145:12.05]We'll make our LOL the worst ending.
[145:13.97]Whatever.
[145:14.75]Geez, it's not so fucking close.
[145:15.91]Those are sharp.
[145:17.79]Psycho.
[145:27.90]Where are you going?
[145:31.47]Automatic 1 plus letter grade.
[145:33.56]Yep.
[145:51.71]Get out of here.
[145:53.47]Dicks.
[145:55.93]Oops.
[146:06.16]Shoot me!
[146:07.02]Shoot!
[146:07.44]Go on, shoot!
[146:21.44]Shoot me!
[146:22.94]I can take it.
[146:32.01]Ooh, yo!
[146:32.93]Alright.
[146:33.17]Get the guy in the back.
[146:42.83]Fuck.
[146:46.39]Okay, hit by a car.
[146:50.75]Oh, fucking cars are coming!
[146:55.88]I missed?
[147:06.64]Double it up.
[147:07.36]Got it.
[147:09.72]What a fucking idiot.
[147:30.80]Watch out for the guy above you!
[147:33.38]Okay.
[147:40.56]Holy fuck.
[147:43.55]Oh, he's gone.
[147:44.03]Oh, boy.
[147:49.73]I gotta hit the helicopter.
[147:51.65]Like that.
[147:52.01]Dr. Robotnik, you suck.
[147:55.31]Uh-oh.
[148:06.91]Almost got it.
[148:07.31]I talked a lot of shit.
[148:20.02]This is not good.
[148:23.58]Didn't hit him.
[148:36.96]Talking mad shit with somebody in missile range.
[148:45.56]Got it.
[148:56.21]Make sure I don't run into anything.
[148:59.69]Ooh, fuck.
[149:01.17]Got it.
[149:02.38]Is it three?
[149:02.94]Yeah, it's Dr. Robotnik.
[149:04.80]Only three hits.
[149:05.30]You got it.
[149:13.64]It's over.
[149:14.90]You put me through a lot tonight, let me just tell you.
[149:17.58]You think I've never done this before?
[149:18.88]I've killed six of you, Null.
[149:21.07]How the fuck do you think I got this job?
[149:24.35]You think I look like shit now?
[149:25.47]This is a fucking scratch.
[149:27.33]Snow can't save you from this.
[149:30.69]You know, this one Null shot me seven fucking times.
[149:35.21]From a mile away, when I found him, I rang his neck like a fucking dishrag.
[149:40.79]Like a fucking dishrag.
[149:42.57]Fuckin'.
[149:45.41]You think you're tough shit, the dragon?
[149:47.39]Well, I'm the Dragonslayer!
[149:48.65]He is not the Dragonslayer.
[149:51.89]Was this Rested Development?
[149:56.35]I am... You've been difficult to find.
[150:05.13]I have questions.
[150:09.85]This game is weird.
[150:11.31]You missed your appointment this morning.
[150:12.85]I learned why when I turned on the news.
[150:16.58]There's a smoldering helicopter on the highway.
[150:18.38]The mayhem you've caused is inexcusable.
[150:20.34]We will talk tomorrow.
[150:23.28]Go directly home and prepare for tomorrow's appointment.
[150:29.30]I don't think that's what I'm doing.
[150:38.63]You look like you've had a rough day.
[150:39.67]Give me something strong.
[150:40.41]What do you got back there?
[150:51.41]Six more fucking months.
[150:52.79]We would have blown those fuckers out of the water.
[150:57.85]Trying bastards couldn't fight for shit.
[150:59.78]How the fuck did they win?
[151:01.98]What's going on?
[151:03.36]You got something to say?
[151:04.50]I'm not doing anything.
[151:05.18]I'm just sitting here.
[151:07.14]You know where you are right now, don't you?
[151:09.38]In a bar.
[151:12.84]I... I did it.
[151:14.50]I was in the war.
[151:17.26]Looks like a distinguished service crescent.
[151:19.94]Tarek.
[151:22.21]Yeah, where did you get it?
[151:23.81]Pawn shop on 5th?
[151:25.05]You got a real baby face.
[151:28.99]Ain't nobody but vets and junkies in the 3rd district.
[151:31.71]And you ain't a vet.
[151:34.71]How many... I was injured.
[151:37.07]I don't know.
[151:41.07]Nice story, babyface.
[151:41.79]War ended 7 years ago.
[151:43.05]You would have been sucking your mama's tit when you were out in the jungle.
[151:50.99]You know, we would've fuckin' won if those goddamn hippies in the first district weren't bitchin' about the child killings.
[151:59.63]What the fuck?
[152:03.92]I don't like either of these two.
[152:08.26]That's the spirit.
[152:08.86]This rounds on me, babyface.
[152:10.66]Ah, thanks.
[152:18.89]They hated us, so I thought we'd be heroes, man.
[152:21.97]I thought I'd get all the... puss... sh... uh... when we came back.
[152:30.07]It's because of those... psychics, or whatever government mind control spec ops... laboratories test tube freaks.
[152:38.56]Try to say it!
[152:39.42]I'll... I... I... It's an icky... It's an icky word.
[152:42.40]I don't like that... I don't like the word... Look, I don't like that word.
[152:45.54]That word, I just don't, I'd rather, I don't like how it sounds.
[152:49.53]I don't like how it just rolls off the tongue.
[152:50.99]I don't like it.
[152:52.83]No, not, not icky in that.
[152:54.25]I'm talking about like, I just don't like the way, I don't like saying that.
[152:56.41]I don't like that word.
[152:57.45]I don't like it.
[152:58.03]I just don't like that word.
[152:58.97]It's like, ignore that old blowhard.
[153:03.80]What is Kronos?
[153:13.66]What do I say instead?
[153:15.78]I don't know.
[153:16.14]I don't- I don't know!
[153:17.26]I don't know!
[153:18.10]I just don't like- It's just a- I don't like that word.
[153:25.39]It's just- I can't even say it.
[153:29.99]I can't say it.
[153:30.89]I'm not gonna say it.
[153:31.83]I can't.
[153:32.19]I just don't like that word.
[153:34.13]I don't like the word.
[153:34.87]I just gotta- I don't like it.
[153:36.11]Apparently they had some kind of drug to make him see the future or read minds or something.
[153:44.11]I had a buddy who met one, played a game of cards, and won every hand.
[153:47.16]Like, he knew how it would play out before it even happened.
[153:51.62]Okay.
[153:54.58]He telling you the card game story?
[153:58.57]Shut it, Ray.
[153:59.27]Look, all I'm saying is there was some serious sci-fi shit going on, and maybe we would have won if they left the fighting to real soldiers.
[154:11.87]You know, in seven years, not a single civy has listened to me.
[154:16.20]You're a bad liar, but you're a good guy.
[154:20.48]Well, drink up.
[154:27.84]Bar's closing.
[154:28.68]It's time to go, sir.
[154:32.68]They took care of your tab.
[154:33.95]Let's go.
[154:46.76]This is just the Yoshi's Island mushroom stuff.

[155:39.28]Why would I be mad?
[155:41.94]I'm sorry last night when I asked you for help you wouldn't listen to me.
[155:45.49]I thought you were mad at me There was something wrong with me last night Dad's friends came over.
[155:55.69]I didn't have anywhere to go so I hid under the stairs with behemoth I didn't eat dinner last night.

[156:48.55]Okay, have a good day.

[156:56.43]It's tahini paste.
[157:01.03]Those of you that know what that means.
[157:04.59]When I was... For some of the new viewers.
[157:06.91]People that weren't here when we talked about this.
[157:09.47]This is not advice.
[157:11.13]Don't listen to me.
[157:11.73]This is disgusting shit.
[157:12.99]Don't listen.
[157:13.69]Do not do this.
[157:15.31]Nutritional shit.
[157:16.47]You need to go see a nutritionist or a doctor.
[157:18.09]Don't listen to me.
[157:18.71]I fucking have no idea what I'm talking about.
[157:20.21]Don't ever listen to anything I say.
[157:22.88]Um, when I was- I used to be very, very, very skinny.
[157:26.14]Even skinnier than I am now.
[157:27.81]And I really wanted to gain weight.
[157:28.93]I went to the gym all the time and I got a lot of- I put on a lot of weight.
[157:32.17]One of the things that I used to do is I would eat tahini paste.
[157:37.63]Uh, because tahini paste is gram for gram the highest calorie per unit thing on Earth.
[157:46.90]I would put it on sandwiches.
[157:48.32]I would have like two spoonfuls.
[157:49.74]It is hundreds of calories per spoonful.
[157:52.96]It's fucking horrible.
[157:56.10]But it was... I was able to put on weight.
[158:00.78]That's disgusting.
[158:01.57]That's disgusting.
[158:03.91]Why is that disgusting?
[158:05.71]I mean, I just told you it is.
[158:11.45]I just told you it was disgusting.
[158:15.83]Just eat normal food.
[158:22.92]Just eat normal food.
[158:24.14]I know, but... If you eat...

[159:10.64]I don't even care.

[159:29.35]Oh.
[159:35.72]Pussy cat.
[159:36.78]Okay, we're good.
[159:37.76]Done.
[159:39.64]There are two dozen wrecked motorcycles and a goddamn helicopter on the highway.
[159:51.21]I didn't have a choice.
[159:51.99]It's time to get huge.
[160:03.75]He's uncomfortable.
[160:04.61]No, I'm not.
[160:05.93]I just don't... I don't like... I don't like that word.
[160:11.21]It's a shitty word.
[160:12.05]That word sucks.
[160:13.83]And you shouldn't use it in your regular vocabulary.
[160:19.16]Use... Use fucking... I don't know.
[160:30.82]Well, a superior saw him with this... God damn it.
[160:36.67]Why am I back here?
[160:41.27]You're not looking hot right now.
[160:42.23]I bet you want a hit of that good stuff, huh?
[160:44.43]You're supposed to be dead.
[160:49.05]Yeah, fuck you.
[160:49.65]I missed my date, asshole.
[160:54.35]He's a dirty shit.
[160:55.67]Shit to hear dirty words.
[161:01.37]Rough day, but whatever.
[161:05.34]It doesn't have any arms.
[161:06.16]It doesn't even compare to what's in store for you.
[161:07.72]You don't even know about it.
[161:10.04]You don't even know about it, do you?
[161:11.26]The withdrawal.
[161:12.64]Withdrawal from what?
[161:20.68]Haha, you stupid motherfucker.
[161:21.74]You really don't have a clue, do you?
[161:23.02]When Kronos leaves the system, time slows to a crawl until it stops completely.
[161:32.71]That sounds terrible.
[161:33.21]Maybe I can show you some of the-
[162:01.50]Get your dossier on the way out and act like a goddamn professional tonight, dragon.
[162:06.60]The name would almost be humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives and everything we've worked for.
[162:13.98]I'm not the dragon, though.
[162:16.34]How preposterous of me.
[162:17.48]Of course you're not responsible for the rash of highly visible third district murders.
[162:21.85]It must be some other dragon.
[162:23.03]I know I met the dragon.
[162:29.19]What?
[162:31.66]When?
[162:32.18]On the highway during the mission.
[162:37.57]I was not expecting that.
[162:38.63]Who is this person?
[162:41.43]Tall, long, blonde hair swordsman.
[162:47.91]Do you want an indicator of just how fucked up this chat has been today?
[162:52.48]I'm telling you.
[162:53.94]There's something in the water today.
[162:56.60]Important question.
[162:57.42]Look at this.
[162:58.36]Would you consider selling... Look at that.
[163:00.96]You understand?
[163:01.38]Like, that's what we're dealing with today.
[163:05.87]We are aware of an individual who fits that profile.
[163:08.07]Did he say anything to you?
[163:09.95]No, he just said he was the dragon.
[163:14.56]I see.
[163:14.88]Very good.
[163:15.24]Yeah, is it a full moon?
[163:16.22]Somebody check.
[163:20.38]I had other plans, but... Yes, I want you to track down and kill this person.
[163:24.86]He cannot be allowed to cause more damage.
[163:28.70]Alright, but I thought, is he really the dragon?
[163:36.46]What?
[163:41.43]You are treading on very thin ice.
[163:43.07]There is no longer room for failure.
[163:47.43]From this point on, if you display anything less than your utmost compliance of professionalism, you will be replaced.
[163:53.84]Now get out of here.
[164:01.79]Alright.
[164:04.07]Stay the hell away from there.
[164:08.29]Delete account.
[164:09.83]It actually is a full moon.
[164:11.67]Yeah, of course it is.
[164:16.98]Of course it is!
[164:19.28]Is it a full moon tonight?
[164:25.48]Would you look at that?
[164:28.76]Every time we've checked...
[164:31.00]Every single time we've checked, if it's a full moon, people are going fucking nuts in this chat.
[164:36.44]It's been either almost a full moon or a full-blown full moon.
[164:39.70]The next full moon will occur on January 10th.
[164:43.98]It is known as the Wolf Moon.
[164:46.25]There are many legends and folklore about wolves.
[164:49.21]Yeah, it's today.
[164:51.11]It does not surprise me.
[164:54.50]Target is the drag and target of interest, considered extremely skilled and dangerous, connected with murder of several government employees.
[165:00.53]Last seen in high-profile Chinatown casino.
[165:02.99]Casino.
[165:14.73]Of course it's a full fucking moon.
[165:18.70]Can I play the slots?
[165:22.56]Time to gamble, let's go.
[165:26.64]Hey man, nice bathrobe.
[165:28.38]My mom has the same one.
[165:30.72]Thanks.
[165:33.20]So you want to play?

[165:38.00]Red or black.
[165:38.66]50-50 shot.
[165:39.98]5x payout.
[165:40.48]What do you say?
[165:43.18]How does it work?
[165:45.42]It's 50-50.
[165:46.28]Just pick a color and put down chips.
[165:48.03]Jesus.
[165:50.21]Um, isn't roulette usually more complicated?
[165:53.38]Look at the big man with the fancy questions.
[165:55.58]Maybe we do things a little different at unimpeachable Chen's houch of legitimate wagers.
[166:02.28]Huh?
[166:03.00]You gonna waste more of my time?
[166:04.58]I'm all in.

[166:27.03]Black again.
[166:30.15]Spin that wheel.
[166:34.47]Ooh, red.
[166:35.45]Ooh, so close.
[166:36.07]Maybe you shouldn't have gone all in, huh?
[166:37.44]Better luck next time.
[166:43.40]Come on.
[166:49.16]Hey, man.
[166:49.40]Let's play.
[166:51.53]Alright.

[166:55.48]Let's spin the wheel.
[166:58.78]Wow, what do you know?
[166:59.80]It's black.
[167:01.20]Hmm.
[167:02.64]Do it again.
[167:03.70]This time it's red.
[167:05.04]Mamma mia, red or black?
[167:06.26]Red.
[167:07.70]Alright, let's spin the wheel.
[167:12.25]Wow, red.
[167:14.19]You're a lucky one, aren't you?
[167:15.67]Bet everything again.
[167:17.81]Red or black?
[167:18.61]Red.
[167:21.17]Alright, let's just spin that wheel.
[167:26.42]Red!
[167:27.00]Looks like we've got a regular Ding Dong Daddy from Dummas on our hands.
[167:32.17]I'm out of chips.
[167:33.41]You've bled me dry.
[167:34.25]Here's all I got.
[167:34.95]$99,999.
[167:35.07]Hey, thanks.
[167:36.31]Save?
[167:36.47]Should I save right here?
[167:41.88]Alright, I want to play a slot.
[168:01.22]You're not getting back here without 100,000 ships.
[168:05.13]I have 999,000.
[168:08.63]Well, there are only 99,999 ships here, but they don't call me Lenny the Lenient for nothing.
[168:13.89]Go on through.
[168:19.85]But how did the Russian know about Null?
[168:23.84]He was a fool.
[168:25.44]But whoever he worked for isn't, and they're trying to bring back Kronos.
[168:30.83]That's why I'm here.
[168:31.63]I'm so close.
[168:32.53]I know I am, but I need your help.
[168:34.63]This is our chance for revenge.
[168:37.79]The war ended seven years ago.
[168:38.91]I'm too tired for revenge.
[168:40.69]And with Al-Qasim gone, the Kronos, I don't have much time.
[168:47.73]For taking away our lives, for making us monsters.
[168:49.99]For making us fight their wars and purging us when they were done.
[168:55.29]We don't have much time, but I'm so close.
[168:57.19]I want you to see... I want you to see something.
[169:01.72]Hello?
[169:03.70]Hello?
[169:04.58]Get out of here.
[169:05.12]I'll handle this.
[169:07.24]Right.
[169:10.60]Whoever you are, you just made a huge mistake.
[169:15.91]Oh, did I?
[169:16.39]Oh, that's gonna shoot me.
[169:25.33]Yes, that should work.
[169:30.69]What the hell?
[169:31.78]You were dead?
[169:33.50]This isn't over.
[169:39.40]What's in the safe?
[169:41.10]More money?
[169:41.72]Got prison security tapes.
[169:45.94]You're surrounded.
[169:46.68]Surrender now.
[169:57.95]No.
[170:00.20]No.
[170:05.71]Bring on the music.
[170:07.15]Now playing Chinatown.
[170:08.57]Bill Kiley.
[170:13.01]And... Oh, this one's good.
[170:17.20]This is a good one.
[170:18.40]This is good.
[170:31.21]See ya.
[170:36.19]Ooh, can I grab it if I jump?
[170:37.39]Yes, I can.
[170:39.33]Oops.
[170:40.54]Wait, I can... What's going on?
[170:43.68]What's going on?
[170:49.24]Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[170:54.24]What's going on?
[170:55.04]What's going on?
[171:02.01]Right?
[171:15.61]I can do that shit now.
[171:18.00]I can be fucking hilarious, man.
[171:32.47]He's a comedy master.
[171:35.67]You were already funny, Jerma.
[171:37.55]Money has changed you.
[171:39.95]I'm not gonna do that.
[171:41.07]I did that once.
[171:43.53]Money has changed you.
[171:46.47]I plugged in a fucking microphone into an actual audio interface, and all of a sudden, I'm different now.
[171:54.72]It's still me.
[171:55.52]It's me.
[171:56.34]It's still me.
[171:57.76]I'm right here.
[171:59.72]It's still me.
[172:02.78]Nothing's that's the same me.
[172:12.61]You're infected.
[172:13.31]I'm not infected.
[172:14.13]I'm not infected.
[172:29.84]Would I have been able to do that if I was infected?
[172:42.42]He's got the comedy virus.
[172:50.23]Comedy virus.
[172:51.09]Get out of here.
[172:55.02]Probably didn't need to use... What?
[173:09.74]Guys, I did the what's going on thing like four years ago.
[173:13.46]This time I just have an echo on it.
[173:15.84]This time there's an echo attached.
[173:17.38]Wait, the echo makes me a comedy streamer?
[173:38.80]full moons, man.
[173:42.32]Alright, the next time I'm playing in streams, I'm gonna make sure I don't stream on a full moon.
[173:46.62]I'm gonna be like, wait, it's a full moon tonight?
[173:48.30]Oh, people are gonna be fucked.
[173:58.93]Hey guys, sorry, I can't stream tonight.
[174:01.43]Why?
[174:01.69]What's wrong?
[174:02.69]Oh, well, it's a full moon.
[174:04.37]And all of you lose your fucking minds.
[174:10.05]Astrology, I'm telling you.
[174:15.75]This guy's blocking everything.
[174:19.17]Fuck.
[174:25.89]Shoot again.
[174:32.07]Shoot again.
[174:32.39]Shoot again.
[174:37.42]Oops.
[174:38.32]I need to...
[174:42.41]Shoot, again, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[174:49.47]Fuck, I'm trying to swing at it.
[175:02.34]Fuck, what am I doing?
[175:04.88]Derm is a Virgo?
[175:05.76]Yes, I am.
[175:18.96]Watch out for the explosions.
[175:20.04]It's gonna blow up.
[175:20.56]Can I hit it?
[175:24.02]Hit it.
[175:24.60]Wait, what?
[175:29.73]What?
[175:30.13]I can't swing at these to blow them up?
[175:31.31]How am I supposed to blow them up?
[175:49.95]Use the drone?
[175:50.53]Ah, whatever.
[175:50.99]I'll just kill him.
[175:59.67]Don't look!
[176:00.09]Don't look!
[176:00.45]Don't look!
[176:00.79]Don't look!
[176:02.48]Oh, come on!
[176:03.36]Did I really just do that?
[176:11.42]Oh, I thought that was a background thing.
[176:13.00]Okay, I'm fine.
[176:16.02]How do I...
[176:28.53]Did he actually hit me?
[176:41.75]Watch it.
[176:43.25]No, I didn't even pick it up.
[176:50.39]Dodge around him in.
[176:51.17]Okay.
[176:52.31]Watch it.
[176:52.63]Watch it.
[176:52.93]Watch it.
[176:53.21]Watch it.
[176:53.41]He's going to shoot me.
[176:54.17]Okay.
[176:54.35]Wait until he gets over here.
[177:00.51]Shoot him.
[177:01.23]Shoot!
[177:02.91]Oh, fuck.
[177:15.16]What the fuck?
[177:15.80]Ooh!
[177:18.16]Ooh.
[177:18.76]Go.
[177:19.16]Out.
[177:22.01]Help me, Jerma.
[177:22.59]Help me.
[177:23.11]I can't help you.
[177:34.18]I thought I got over it.
[177:43.38]Dodge around, get him.
[177:46.92]Good.
[177:47.42]Nice.
[177:50.60]Moon time.
[177:51.20]Let's get some full moons in the chat, please.
[178:13.45]That's taken care of.
[178:14.35]Let's go through here.
[178:16.35]I'll kill you.
[178:16.99]Oh, no, I won't.
[178:18.39]Yes, I will.
[178:23.70]This is Molotov.
[178:24.72]Hold on.
[178:30.44]Fuck it.
[178:30.78]God damn it.
[178:46.50]Oops.
[178:49.14]I knew you were around that.
[178:50.57]What?
[178:50.93]Alright, don't pick that up.
[179:09.34]That's it.
[179:09.70]Alright, let's bring this upstairs.
[179:20.00]Oops.
[179:20.60]I think... Okay, no.
[179:21.40]That was good.
[179:22.46]Can I carry this with me?
[179:25.16]What's going on?
[179:26.01]Oh.
[179:26.49]Well, I'm playing Katana ZERO.
[179:28.33]It's a fun game.
[179:29.31]This chat needs an exorcist.
[179:32.09]This chat needs an exorcist.
[179:38.73]You guys need... You guys need something.
[179:43.74]We have you trying to get on your knees and put your hands up.
[179:48.42]Do it.
[179:48.96]Now.
[179:54.50]The golden moon casteth wide its brilliant smile upon the altar of thy Jerma985 chat room.
[180:02.26]The chat members bathe in the glow and go fucking hollow.
[180:09.05]What the fuck?
[180:09.57]Get back now!
[180:15.81]The stars dictate thy ultimate death.
[180:18.13]Ring from the errant heart libations of blood upon this hallowed altar.
[180:25.40]How did you get here?
[180:27.78]I was here all along.
[180:28.84]What are you talking about?
[180:32.72]Thou heedest not my grim horuspicy, but not three nights ago did I foretell thy choice of silver, death, and golden life.
[180:44.69]This altar demandeth thine answers.
[180:46.47]Dost thou choose the golden mask of life to stay thy blade and be reborn in grace?
[180:51.71]Or dost thou choose the silver mask of death
[180:54.73]And so upon this fallow soil, fallow the blood of thine enemy.
[180:59.62]People don't talk like this anymore.
[181:01.84]Life or death, what a choice, huh?
[181:04.36]Glad I'm not in your shoes right now.
[181:11.25]Why do I have to die here?
[181:14.41]Does the star say so?
[181:15.71]Or maybe it's because of that drug business you're tied up in, or all those people you killed, or maybe we just like fucking with you.
[181:26.08]Me, personally, I like fucking with you.
[181:31.70]So what do you say?
[181:32.34]You want to live or die?
[181:33.60]I... I want to live?
[181:37.90]What are you talking... I can't... I can't die.
[181:41.26]I want to live.
[181:42.96]My final death is imminent.
[181:44.49]Aaron Hart.
[181:47.79]This is for real.
[181:48.87]The Kronos in your bloodstream is running out.
[181:50.77]You'll actually die if you choose to.
[181:55.54]But think of all the people who will live like these fucking cops and that little friend of yours.
[182:00.17]He he.
[182:02.71]What does the girl have to do with this?
[182:06.43]Oh, nothing.
[182:06.79]Forget I said anything.
[182:07.97]But surely you'll choose to live.
[182:09.99]You have so much unfinished work to do.
[182:16.77]Remember that little talk we had the other night about a big choice you had to make?
[182:20.38]Here it is.
[182:21.34]Life or death.
[182:21.92]You choose.
[182:26.09]Choose life, these guys die, and you walk away.
[182:28.15]Choose death, and well, I think you can figure it out.
[182:33.07]The choice thou makest effecteth more than just thine own fate.
[182:38.84]To dawn the mask of death is to embody death, and likewise the mask of life bestoweth life unto those thy heart seeketh to protect.
[182:47.32]What do I do?
[182:50.32]What do you choose?
[182:52.22]I want to live, I want to die.
[182:53.40]Uh...
[182:55.88]I don't have time.
[182:56.40]I don't have time.
[182:56.92]I don't have time.
[182:57.32]I don't have time.
[182:58.80]I don't have time.
[182:59.65]The little girl lives if I... Okay.
[183:01.09]Little girl... Little girl lives.
[183:04.59]Is this the choice?
[183:05.45]To accept the final end and bear the golden mask of... What?
[183:09.03]Wait, what did I just... Wait, wait, wait.
[183:09.93]What did I do?
[183:12.15]Did I pick the wrong one?
[183:13.17]No, I didn't.
[183:13.90]Did I actually?
[183:16.18]I thought I picked... Did I... No, seriously.
[183:17.98]Did I actually pick the wrong one?
[183:19.50]I picked death, right?
[183:22.24]Are they prepared to bear its death in the place of those they seek to protect?
[183:26.26]Bear death.
[183:27.44]Yes.
[183:32.96]May thou find us peace and death.
[183:35.12]Yeah, what the hell?
[183:35.64]Why would he say that?
[183:48.73]That, what?
[183:49.49]Hold on.
[183:49.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[183:51.82]Did you guys have duds to end the game?
[184:03.43]The game's over!
[184:05.39]The game ends?
[184:06.07]Actually, you picked the wrong... Can I go back?
[184:09.59]Can I go back?
[184:17.81]We did it.
[184:18.57]Omega LOL.
[184:19.35]Pepe laughs.
[184:21.37]Ha ha ha.
[184:22.05]They said four times it was the real end.
[184:23.91]But, okay, in a game where you're on drugs and... Oh, I haven't appeared inside of the psychiatrist's or therapy chair.
[184:31.44]And they're like, hey...
[184:33.64]Criken?
[184:38.28]Wait, wait.
[184:38.78]What?
[184:39.12]Criken's in this?
[184:40.64]What did Criken do?
[184:41.80]What?
[184:42.74]Alright.
[184:47.49]But I don't know.
[184:49.13]I can't tell what's real and not real.
[184:51.05]We've had the game restart five times randomly in random places.
[185:00.18]Nah, that can't be the end.
[185:04.34]It's going to be like a joke.
[185:05.66]It's going to be like, oh, hey, you're sitting back in the chair.
[185:08.26]I'm giving you the drugs, right?
[185:09.20]It's probably something like that.
[185:29.89]Yes.
[185:31.33]Previous level.
[185:35.23]I'm good.
[185:39.21]Alright, here we go.
[185:40.17]Let's go.
[185:40.78]I choose life.
[185:41.40]I was gonna say that's... Alright.
[185:48.00]I choose life.
[185:52.87]Jerma has the reading comprehension of a gerbil.
[185:57.40]I'm on drugs the entire game.
[186:00.14]Am I really supposed to believe with two random guys that teleport to me and say, you're gonna die, you know?
[186:07.08]Like, I'm supposed to believe anything these two fucking idiots are telling me?
[186:13.37]I can't believe, Jerma, this must be the full moon.
[186:16.25]Not the teleporting drug people.
[186:22.73]Let's go.
[186:29.58]I choose life.
[186:44.00]Why would you kill millions of people for a little girl?
[186:46.29]I don't... I don't even know what's going on right now.
[186:52.37]I don't even know what's happening in the story.
[186:54.25]I know, like, slightly.
[186:56.83]I'm ready to make my choice.
[187:00.34]What do you choose?
[187:02.08]I want to live.
[187:05.32]Is this by choice?
[187:08.06]To forego the final end?
[187:10.97]Are you prepared to face the consequences to embody death and welcome it upon those around you?
[187:16.85]Wait, no, what?
[187:17.55]Why are they wording it like this?
[187:22.80]No.
[187:25.28]No, yes.
[187:26.20]Yes.
[187:28.44]This will be fun!
[187:31.33]So be it.
[187:31.87]Thou choosest to bear the silver mask of death and SCORN the peace of final death.
[187:36.89]Now that others shall bear the consequences of thy choice, farewell.
[187:46.08]When shit like this happens in the game, like what, you... I can't believe he didn't know that he was gonna see the credits if he picked die.
[187:56.09]Pepe fucking hands.
[187:57.97]The favors like to call in, the phone calls I've had to make, and ensure that the media wouldn't hear about your latest killing spree.
[188:05.13]An entire police squad is dead for nothing.
[188:07.09]For absolutely fucking nothing.
[188:09.24]I can no longer excuse your egregious behavior and failures.
[188:11.76]There will be dire consequences for tonight.
[188:19.10]Hello, welcome back.
[188:19.76]Uh, that... Sorry, you cleaned the house.
[188:27.08]Yeah, it was kind of a mess, so I cleaned it up a little bit.
[188:28.88]Not a big deal.
[188:33.90]What's that?
[188:34.20]Is it a movie?
[188:35.94]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[188:37.40]We're not watching movies anymore.
[188:38.94]That's something I found today.
[188:42.62]Oh, well, can we get a movie then?
[188:44.87]Yes, we'll go get an appropriate movie.
[188:52.43]We're gonna get an age-appropriate film this time.
[188:56.41]Hey, man.
[188:58.69]Those pre-war samurai tapes you ordered just got in.
[189:01.31]Let me get them.
[189:04.30]Hey, can we get a cartoon?
[189:06.62]I already ordered some movies.
[189:07.76]Next time.
[189:08.16]No, why would I... No, I want to... Oh, man.
[189:14.56]Next time, then.
[189:15.26]Okay.
[189:15.72]I thought I... I want to do a cartoon.
[189:18.83]32 credits.
[189:23.37]Later, man.
[189:24.51]Goodbye.
[189:24.77]Okay.
[189:25.87]Okay.
[189:31.95]I have returned for the crimson blade.
[189:33.77]Hand it to me or taste my folded steel.
[189:38.71]I always knew this day would come.
[189:40.27]Come, brother.
[189:40.93]Let me test your mettle.
[189:44.44]Ayee.
[189:44.98]Eek!
[189:47.58]He's bleeding.
[189:48.22]The bad man stabbed him.
[189:49.38]This movie is too scary.
[189:52.60]Don't worry.
[189:53.16]It's not real.
[189:53.84]Why would I have a little kid watch these movies?
[189:58.34]I know it's not real, but it's still scary.
[190:01.83]Are you a samurai too?
[190:02.91]Like the ones in the movie?
[190:06.47]I don't know.
[190:09.13]Really?
[190:09.43]You look like one and you have a cool sword.
[190:11.45]I think you're a samurai.
[190:15.15]And now my death blow from hell.
[190:18.61]Aye.
[190:20.54]He just cut off his head.
[190:23.54]Lord Awais.
[190:25.16]It is I, Reishi.
[190:26.94]Come to rescue Princess Issun.
[190:29.14]You shall die.
[190:31.70]My son, you are foolhardy as ever.
[190:34.57]For it is you who will die today.
[190:38.43]Ah, clashing blades.
[190:39.75]Ah.
[190:54.99]Foolhardy.
[190:55.75]What?
[190:58.29]What is that?
[191:01.64]Is that another tape?
[191:07.36]Did you guys hear?
[191:08.36]One of the prisoners is testifying in some big hearing tomorrow.
[191:12.90]Yeah, some military conspiracy thing, right?
[191:16.66]Sounds important.
[191:17.76]Shouldn't we have beefed up security?
[191:19.34]Nah, it's probably fine.
[191:26.44]You're surrounded!
[191:27.48]Surrender now!
[191:28.34]Be!
[191:32.61]Oh, well that was... okay.
[191:34.74]That was pretty ridiculous.
[191:42.56]Oh shit.
[191:52.82]So is this Katana ZERO?
[191:54.36]This is Katana ZERO.
[191:55.80]I already figured it out.
[192:08.86]Oops.
[192:16.20]Whoa, you can do that while... Okay, I get it.
[192:23.13]You can do that while... Katana Crew Club.
[192:31.33]Oh, I should probably not read.
[192:32.73]Katana Crew Club.
[192:41.96]Uh, I guess I could jump and then do the thing.
[192:48.70]Everybody has to be, everything has to be a crew.
[192:59.29]Okay, let's go.
[193:10.72]And we go in and... Oopsie.
[193:20.62]What the fuck just happened?
[193:21.62]What?
[193:24.04]Oopsie.
[193:25.68]There we go.
[193:39.70]That makes more sense.
[193:45.17]That makes more sense.
[193:46.43]How about we open this up and kick it down the door and get in there?
[193:54.66]Wee!
[193:54.82]Okay.
[193:58.42]Who else is left?
[193:59.02]You up here?
[194:00.20]I got ya.
[194:01.32]Oops.
[194:05.35]Drove a super frog, enemies.
[194:15.91]I love Super Frog.
[194:18.11]I wish that was a real game.
[194:22.53]And I know, I know you're gonna say, wait, what?
[194:24.10]I know you're gonna say it is a real game, but it's not.
[194:39.46]It's not fully developed.
[194:44.39]Easy.
[194:46.36]What the fuck did they come from?
[194:48.06]Oh, they're going up and down the stairs.
[194:59.59]Ah, shit.
[195:00.33]Okay.
[195:07.92]I'm gonna stay up.
[195:18.66]Stay up.
[195:22.32]I have a gun.
[195:24.46]I couldn't see.
[195:25.16]Fuck.
[195:32.49]God damn it.
[195:33.13]I gotta sit up.
[195:41.71]Oh my god.
[195:42.23]I gotta sit up.
[195:42.91]Oh my god.
[195:43.46]Alright.
[195:46.38]Fuck.
[195:47.44]This is hard.
[195:49.89]You know what's the problem?
[195:50.57]Okay, I gotta stop... I gotta stop caring about that move.
[195:57.11]That move's cool, but it's impractical.
[196:04.44]Only one is necessary to use.
[196:13.60]Back down and around.
[196:30.18]Why can I swing?
[196:50.81]I want names now.
[196:51.63]Who are you?
[196:52.13]Oh, this is what we saw.
[196:53.69]This is what happened before.
[196:54.57]This is Yuan, right?
[196:57.08]Give me names now.
[197:00.54]Give me names!
[197:03.70]Josh Rose.
[197:05.86]He was assassinated this week.
[197:09.48]Omar Al-Qasim.
[197:12.78]Al Qasim.
[197:13.58]Is he the one bringing it back?
[197:15.38]Does he have anything to do with that Russian thug or the ninja lady?
[197:21.28]I... I don't know what you're talking about.
[197:23.75]I didn't know anyone was trying to bring Kronos back.
[197:27.25]I've only spoken to my attorney these last seven years.
[197:31.01]But I can tell you it's not the government, and by my estimation, there are very few entities with the resources to manufacture Kronos.
[197:39.51]Alex and Munoa contact him.
[197:41.72]And Leon von Alvensleben.
[197:44.78]He's the one who made it.
[197:45.52]That's what I wanted to know.
[197:49.72]Please don't kill me.
[197:50.38]Everyone has to die for making us this way.
[197:54.16]Your trial is a farce.
[197:55.08]You're going to die tomorrow anyways.
[197:59.23]Or today.
[198:00.65]I killed him now.
[198:02.19]Two days remain.
[198:10.75]Leon Vaughn, Alvin Slaven, 3rd District Slaughterhouse, and Meat Processing.
[198:19.90]Your questions will be answered.
[198:22.78]Okay.
[198:35.52]I guess that's what we're doing.
[198:36.70]We're at the meat grinder.
[198:37.98]Slaughterhouse, let's go.
[198:48.20]Easy.
[198:57.85]What did I just do?
[198:59.49]Stay tuned for an appointment announcement from your employer.
[199:03.49]It's been a while since I've had a visitor.
[199:05.11]I'm quite thrilled.
[199:09.36]This sorry facility was once the testing ground for the null project.
[199:14.39]Who cares about lore when we're gonna have ads?
[199:16.72]New mecha's most promising soldiers and scientists were ones who threw my gauntlet to a certain their... whatever.
[199:21.68]It's like reading and talking at the same time.
[199:23.48]It's just like I'm trying to play and read and talk and think.
[199:25.88]Let us see how suitable you are.
[199:26.99]Alright, you can't hit me.
[199:27.85]You're fucking terrible at shooting.
[199:30.75]Interesting.
[199:31.21]Proceed.
[199:45.66]Skip the dialog.
[199:46.58]Literally, who cares?
[199:48.18]Laughing my ass off.
[200:08.47]I thought I had time.
[200:09.19]Shit, that was pretty good, too.
[200:10.99]That was going good.
[200:12.11]My ears are itchy.
[200:13.07]Both inside of my fucking ears.
[200:26.99]Shoot.
[200:30.44]Oh, there's a guy in here!
[200:31.32]What?
[200:37.78]Alright, I'm fine.
[200:52.99]I know, I'm making you made this- Oh, look at this guy!
[200:55.48]He makes fucking noises!
[201:15.98]I had it.
[201:29.15]That guy only comes up like half the damn time.
[201:45.53]Whoops.
[201:45.79]I... I'm an idiot.
[201:51.14]What?
[202:07.93]Oops.
[202:08.71]Oh, I fucked it up again.
[202:09.48]It's alright.
[202:19.98]Got it.
[202:20.28]Alright.
[202:20.54]That wasn't so hard.
[202:21.28]Why did I make that so much harder than it needed to be?
[202:33.43]How did I do that?
[202:36.19]Oh shit, he's gonna shoot me.
[202:45.61]Oh.
[202:54.91]We're good.
[202:55.39]Woo!
[202:56.37]I forgot about this part.
[202:57.29]Okay, so now we just have to go, we just dash through.
[202:59.79]That's fine.
[203:08.15]Get the fuck away from me.
[203:12.65]Oh god, this sucks.
[203:14.90]At least I didn't have a gun.
[203:20.38]Anybody else have a gun over there?
[203:22.30]Nobody.
[203:30.68]What is this?
[203:31.34]What's that?
[203:32.10]What is this?
[203:33.56]What is that?
[203:36.52]What's this?
[203:36.92]Okay.
[203:45.40]Alright, another one.
[203:47.23]He doesn't even know what's on him.
[203:54.93]What's going on with my screen?
[203:59.13]Why is my screen doing that?
[204:07.33]Crush him.
[204:07.91]Crush him.
[204:10.87]Oh, come on.
[204:12.70]I almost ran out of time.
[204:14.02]Oh, shit.
[204:22.68]Whatever, just blow it up.
[204:30.05]I shouldn't have done that.
[204:48.41]Don't shoot me, don't shoot me, don't shoot me, don't shoot me, don't shoot those!
[204:50.35]Is this Molotov?
[205:01.16]You motherfucker.
[205:03.80]We're good.
[205:12.20]I want Jerma to start streaming.
[205:16.19]Guys are on fucking drugs.
[205:21.02]What do you think the over-under is that, like, of 2,000 people here are on drugs?
[205:24.72]What do you think?
[205:34.28]Fuck.
[205:38.41]I gotta, alright, I gotta, okay, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta.
[205:39.73]Got it.
[205:46.09]You gotta be kidding me.
[205:54.79]OH FUCK IT'S GONNA- OHH THE THING'S GONNA COME OFF!
[206:01.67]You gotta be- come on man, come on!
[206:09.58]I hate this part.
[206:10.28]I think I'm dying again.
[206:38.66]My God!
[206:54.13]Okay, fuck!
[206:56.12]Just you two.
[206:59.62]What does this do?
[207:00.88]Nope.
[207:01.50]What does this do?
[207:09.35]I'm just gonna be crushing them.
[207:15.93]Why won't it go down?
[207:28.85]Why is this taking so long?
[207:29.91]I don't understand.
[207:33.15]It randomly crushes while it's on.
[207:49.16]Oh.
[207:57.39]Okay.
[207:57.85]That was easy.
[207:59.17]Wait.
[208:00.09]Now it's easy.
[208:06.02]Time save?
[208:06.68]Not really.
[208:12.12]Alright.
[208:12.36]Go up top.
[208:12.84]Go up top.
[208:13.24]Let's go like this.
[208:15.29]Nope.
[208:16.05]I can do that.
[208:37.42]But come on, that didn't hit?
[208:39.04]That didn't hit?
[208:41.32]What are you fucking talking about?
[208:42.78]I'm so mad.
[209:01.96]Why is that not working?
[209:02.98]It worked like three times already.
[209:05.68]What is going on?
[209:08.40]I've done this like three times.
[209:10.12]What?
[209:15.20]Okay, what is happening?
[209:26.47]This happened to me too.
[209:27.77]What?
[209:33.94]Okay, whatever.
[209:34.60]Fuck it.
[209:34.90]I don't care.
[209:37.90]I'm dead.
[209:51.91]Watch out for the fucking laser!
[209:56.89]Get the fuck away from me!
[210:02.42]Oh, that stupid thing!
[210:03.86]Oh, it's so annoying!
[210:18.40]Hello?
[210:30.64]Come back.
[210:32.48]Sour tower assemble.
[210:34.17]Yes.
[210:46.77]Turn off the fucking lasers.
[210:51.18]Who's on the other side of that?
[211:01.62]One guy left, that's it.
[211:08.46]He's flooding the market with Sour Towers.
[211:10.30]Somebody stop that guy!
[211:11.22]Alright, here comes another, uh... This is the final portion of the Null Test.
[211:24.99]It has an astronomical failure rate.
[211:30.27]Okay.
[211:32.37]You have been an entertaining participant thus far.
[211:37.29]Good luck.
[211:39.57]Thank you.
[211:39.87]Oh, okay.
[211:47.68]Well, I have to slow time down.
[211:49.46]Alright, this one's not gonna go down.
[211:52.72]Okay.
[211:57.54]It's the one with the green lights?
[211:59.58]Yeah.
[212:00.36]What am I, stupid?
[212:05.94]I was looking up.
[212:17.13]Okay, I gotta... Okay.
[212:20.47]Ayayay, this sucks.
[212:24.15]Fuck, this sucks.
[212:28.30]I have to start to... Gotta stay in the middle.
[212:45.25]Right there, we're good.
[212:49.45]Back.
[212:50.18]Is that it?
[212:55.04]Did I do it?
[212:55.94]What's going on?
[212:56.34]Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[212:59.20]Not cool, not cool.
[213:07.92]Jesus Christ.
[213:11.38]Don't even think about it.
[213:12.50]What the fuck?
[213:34.61]Jesus.
[213:35.13]God damn it, man.
[213:36.25]Hold on.
[213:41.67]Let me wipe my hands off.
[213:45.86]Hold on.
[213:47.32]My like 7,000 inch long hair is getting in my mouth.
[213:49.88]No, it's not.
[213:50.36]I lied to you.
[213:51.24]I'm just annoyed.
[214:10.29]Fucking guy's got a gun.
[214:17.75]Hey!
[214:20.94]What the fuck is going on bro?
[214:21.94]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[214:23.54]Can I leave?
[214:47.91]Bye.
[214:48.15]The test is over.
[214:50.11]You survived.
[214:50.57]Thank God.
[214:53.50]For Alpha, no.
[214:54.34]The rate of survival is 7%.
[214:55.44]Beta, no.
[214:56.24]The rate of survival is 13%.
[215:01.24]For Gamma, no.
[215:01.86]The rate is 100% of survival.
[215:03.88]Okay.
[215:05.38]Congratulations, prodigal child.
[215:11.07]Thank you.
[215:12.57]Open the door, please.
[215:17.19]That was rough.
[215:23.28]I'm not doing this again, are we?
[215:24.68]Oh, come on.
[215:26.76]It's an even smaller room.
[215:30.26]As a Gamma Null, you were given Kronos from childhood and trained to be a new mecha ultimate soldier.
[215:36.09]Your mastery of time and combat made you a god of the battlefield.
[215:38.87]You should have won the war.
[215:42.19]But ultimately, Kronos and the Null Project were failures.
[215:45.29]I must restart from the beginning.
[215:48.27]Your existence is in error.
[215:50.22]You will receive no Kronos.
[215:53.74]Eh.
[215:54.92]Whatever you say.
[216:04.99]Not this again.
[216:11.45]There's nothing left for you here.
[216:14.69]Go?
[216:14.93]I have work to do and I can't be disturbed.
[216:16.43]Okay.
[216:18.59]Goodbye.
[216:21.91]Can you open the gate before I go?
[216:28.25]What?
[216:31.06]Did my controller unplug or is this part of the game?
[216:35.22]Oh, my controller unplugged.
[216:36.10]Okay.
[216:48.87]You've exceeded the limits of my patience.
[216:52.35]Yeah, my work is too important.
[216:54.09]I cannot be disturbed.
[216:56.27]To proceed further is to terminate your own existence.
[216:58.29]I pick to live, actually.
[217:11.34]Turn on... Wait a minute, this is my dream.
[217:17.55]Remember my dream?
[217:18.17]This is that spot.
[217:23.67]Turn it on.
[217:27.83]It's been a while since I've had a visitor.
[217:29.23]I'm quite thrilled.
[217:30.07]Let's see how suitable you are.
[217:35.06]What's this?
[217:35.34]Open the chamber.
[217:36.06]Wait, should I do that?
[217:57.90]Pre-recorded.
[217:58.56]How's it going?
[218:06.44]Who's this?
[218:06.84]That looked pretty horrible.
[218:16.55]That didn't look good.
[218:17.77]Where the hell are you?
[218:18.57]Why didn't you come in today?
[218:20.61]You killed an entire police squad last night.
[218:22.39]Do you understand the jeopardy your erratic behavior is putting us in?
[218:27.07]It was the guy?
[218:28.39]What the hell are you doing?
[218:33.38]Hello, welcome back.
[218:34.28]I found something cool today.
[218:35.22]Want to see?
[218:36.12]What is it?
[218:38.26]I don't want to spoil it.
[218:38.98]It's really cool.
[218:39.52]Come on.
[218:44.64]It's right up here.
[218:51.64]It's the city we're in.
[218:57.00]Okay.
[219:00.50]It goes so far.
[219:01.36]I wonder what's beyond the mountains.
[219:05.11]You can't see all the muck and trash up here.
[219:07.99]Just the lights.
[219:08.49]It's pretty.
[219:10.81]I want to see it all someday.
[219:14.07]My only response is no.
[219:15.19]Why is it only... What?
[219:20.25]We're going somewhere better.
[219:21.37]Somewhere far away.
[219:24.71]Like the second district.
[219:28.81]Okay.
[219:34.92]Hey, what's that?
[219:37.78]It's from the war.
[219:38.62]A medal.
[219:40.98]Wow, you were in a war?
[219:42.06]That means you're a hero.
[219:44.18]You need to clean it, though.
[219:45.21]It's really dirty.
[219:48.03]I haven't taken it off in seven years.
[219:49.99]It reminds me that no matter what I'm doing, I did something good once.
[219:58.03]Just throw it?
[219:58.85]Why'd you do that?
[220:02.55]I have other reminders now.
[220:05.97]Oh.
[220:10.13]Can we stay up here for a little longer?
[220:13.08]Yes.
[220:15.94]I'm pretty sleepy, but... I don't want the men in the masks to come back.
[220:26.07]uh then I I they're not gonna get you you promise okay alright so we got we got some weird going on it's not is this judgment day don't let her get hurt I'm gonna do everything I can hey hey wake up what
[220:54.75]Were you having a nightmare?
[220:55.55]It's time to get up.
[221:01.92]Look, I made breakfast.
[221:05.76]Uh, okay.
[221:06.50]What is it?
[221:08.15]Oh, I don't know.
[221:08.83]You didn't have a whole lot in the kitchen.
[221:11.25]It's tahini paste.
[221:12.37]I found a couple of fish heads and some tahini paste and then made a soup out of it.
[221:15.67]That's gonna be gross.
[221:17.45]Thank you.
[221:25.53]Pretty good cat puke noise, if I will say so myself.
[221:28.49]How was it?
[221:29.11]It was, uh, it's my favorite.
[221:30.61]I loved it.
[221:34.01]Your new favorite?
[221:34.55]That makes me so happy.
[221:35.35]I thought it tasted pretty bad.
[221:36.41]Uh, there's something else.
[221:46.12]I'm gonna let you borrow Behemoth for a little bit.
[221:48.42]Just cause you don't have one yet.
[221:50.43]I don't need him when you're around.
[221:53.89]If you're ever lonely, Behemoth will keep you company.
[221:56.49]But you better take good care of him because he's still my best friend.
[222:00.65]But it's just borrowing.
[222:03.49]Well, look, now Leviathan has a friend.
[222:07.60]And me too.
[222:08.28]And you.
[222:14.24]Well, I know you gotta go now.
[222:15.32]See you later.
[222:19.88]Please, come in and take a seat.
[222:25.61]So you're still alive.
[222:26.57]I was beginning to wonder.
[222:28.13]Not that it matters, because you've gone completely out of control.
[222:33.65]Okay.
[222:35.46]Failing to kill your target, murdering an entire police squad, dereliction of duty.
[222:40.62]I'm surprised you even decided to come back.
[222:44.42]You.
[222:45.84]You fucking...
[222:51.27]This is your last chance.
[222:52.69]If you deviate by even the slightest margin from your orders from here on, our relationship will be terminated.
[223:01.41]You cannot possibly understand how gravely important our work... I was null.
[223:10.38]I... How do you know about that?
[223:12.36]I killed the creator of Kronos.
[223:15.96]Not a big deal.
[223:18.44]But... How did you...
[223:22.74]Fam-ably?
[223:49.62]Your aggression and psychopathy made you a prime candidate for Null.
[223:55.84]You were placed as a child in the Gamma Project, the most elite Null unit.
[223:59.93]Femin-ry.
[224:01.19]You were given Kronos to enhance your abilities in trying to be a super soldier for the new Mecha.
[224:05.83]I don't know much more.
[224:07.71]My psychopathy?
[224:11.73]Ah, you lack the aversion to killing that most people are born with.
[224:15.11]Perhaps I've misread you, but you seem to enjoy it.
[224:19.18]I don't like it.
[224:22.57]Is the only thing I like.
[224:23.67]Killing is the only time I feel alive.
[224:28.31]Yes, it's what makes you so suited for this work, but no matter.
[224:32.82]Null performed extremely sensitive and occasionally morally dubious operations during the war.
[224:37.74]Nobody foresaw the unintended effects of Kronos on the system.
[224:42.70]As the war ended with Kronos, production ceased.
[224:44.83]Most Null died of withdrawal.
[224:49.97]Everyone I kill is related to Kronos.
[224:52.91]Its creators must be silenced forever.
[224:54.49]Kronos can never be allowed to come back into this world.
[225:00.91]Why did you keep all this from me?
[225:01.97]What is this?
[225:02.31]What are you talking about?
[225:04.27]My job is to rehabilitate you, to focus on the future.
[225:06.40]Your past is irrelevant.
[225:07.40]Only the total elimination of Kronos matters.
[225:11.74]Now it's time for your treatment.
[225:24.86]Is he going to kill me?
[225:27.10]Not if I kill him first.
[225:30.10]Get you, Dossier, on the way out.
[225:31.14]You may leave now.
[225:38.53]Alright, here we go.
[225:39.05]This is the final mission of the game.
[225:41.39]The bunker.
[225:41.81]Eliminate any and all sensitive material currently stored in the safe room of Alkissim's bunker.
[225:47.09]Located in the center for synergistic research.
[225:50.39]Expect heavy resistance.
[225:51.47]Leave no survivors.
[225:52.29]Alright.
[225:56.47]Dossier, Dossier, Dossier, Dossier.
[225:59.38]Hi, I'm back.
[226:03.64]Wait, wasn't this a hotel?
[226:05.18]Welcome to the Center for Synergistic Research.
[226:07.46]Are you here for... I remember you!
[226:10.64]You're the guy who showers with your sword!
[226:12.53]Weren't you wearing the same bathrobe at the murderer?
[226:15.41]It's my lucky bathrobe.
[226:20.53]Well, it certainly has character.
[226:21.57]You missed some blood, though.
[226:22.81]Oh, and there...
[226:25.77]So get this, apparently it's my fault the dragon got in the murderer.
[226:29.29]I forgot to check his ID or something.
[226:30.79]Who knows?
[226:31.17]Just don't tell my new boss.
[226:34.17]Anyway, I'll need to see your security clinic.
[226:38.39]Well, excuse me.
[226:39.31]How rude.
[226:39.93]No, I will not shut up until you show me your ID.
[226:44.93]Oh, I'm just here for the showers.
[226:48.35]Hi.
[226:48.61]Oh, I didn't know we had a shower.
[226:50.91]Available to the public.
[226:51.87]I'll have to check my handbook on that.
[226:56.04]It's on page 335, section F2.
[226:59.66]Oh.
[227:00.30]You know the handbook quite well.
[227:01.69]I guess you must be a receptionist, too.
[227:04.13]You sure don't dress like one.
[227:06.69]Well, go on through.
[227:07.97]And have a nice shower.
[227:09.55]Thanks.
[227:13.73]Dope.
[227:23.34]Now playing Overdose.
[227:25.85]Let's go Shoot shoot.
[227:42.63]Hey, whatever Wait till he turns
[227:56.49]You didn't hit him?
[227:56.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[227:58.15]Ah, I'm trying to get to you.
[228:05.46]That one up.
[228:34.95]Damn it.
[228:35.25]I didn't know that was over there.
[228:36.03]I should I gotta look more often Oh my god
[228:53.61]Oh, I see.
[228:54.13]I get it.
[228:54.59]I get it.
[228:54.83]I get it.
[228:55.39]Okay, I gotta wait till it goes over to the door?
[228:57.51]Alright, wait till it gets over to the door.
[228:59.03]Oh, fuck.
[229:07.99]Alright, got it.
[229:12.63]Ready?
[229:16.53]I'm fine.
[229:18.76]Fuck.
[229:26.93]Oh, my God.
[229:27.77]This sucks.
[229:30.87]Am I... Okay.
[229:31.45]Am I doing something wrong here?
[229:35.13]I'm doing something wrong.
[229:41.28]What am... Tell me.
[229:42.26]What am I doing wrong?
[229:42.88]What's going on?
[229:43.56]What am I doing wrong?
[229:44.30]Tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[229:45.02]I'm doing something fucking wrong.
[229:46.02]I have to wait till... Okay.
[229:47.08]I know what I'm doing.
[229:48.00]I know what I'm doing wrong.
[229:49.10]Okay.
[229:49.28]No, no, no.
[229:49.58]Don't tell me.
[229:50.02]Don't tell me.
[229:50.40]I know what I'm doing wrong.
[229:51.26]I know what I'm doing.
[229:52.88]I know what I'm doing wrong.
[229:53.68]I don't know.
[229:53.96]I gotta wait till the bunch is up.
[229:57.08]Like, I mean, I... Oh, man.
[229:59.74]This sucks.
[230:00.44]Okay, I gotta wait till it bunches up together and then you do it.

[232:26.49]Everybody relax.
[232:27.33]What's going on in here?
[232:34.06]I put it in full moon only mode.

[232:55.89]I can't fight.

[237:01.41]Jeremy, pick it up.
[237:02.92]Can I pick it back up?
[237:16.43]I thought I could pick it back up if I was right next to it or something.
[237:18.18]I don't know.
[237:36.39]What?
[237:36.77]I went so far much higher than I thought.
[237:43.99]Get over here.
[237:54.37]That didn't swing.
[237:54.97]Nah, I'm not fucking around.
[238:10.66]Don't let him get away!
[238:29.10]Don't let him get away!
[238:31.42]The door!
[238:31.80]The door!
[238:32.12]The door!

[238:33.04]How do I open the door?
[238:39.64]Oh, thank...
[238:44.43]Alright, I'm safe.
[238:49.41]Hide!
[238:50.27]Null the... Oh, we found who it was.
[239:06.10]Yes, that should work.
[239:11.39]Behold, comedy!
[239:12.43]The wayward swordsman awaketh from poison slumber.
[239:16.86]Hehe, it's getting exciting, isn't it?
[239:20.14]The first act's climax doth approacheth.
[239:49.31]This sounds like Hotline Miami.
[239:56.03]I missed.
[239:57.84]Oh, that's so sad and annoying.
[239:59.96]I'm pissed off.
[240:05.90]I'm just fucking pissed off now.
[240:07.32]I'm pissed off.
[240:46.21]Excuse me!
[240:52.10]What's down there?
[240:52.62]Nothing?
[241:00.12]Not bad.
[241:00.66]Not bad.
[241:01.06]Not a bad run.
[241:02.16]I have to... Oh, I use guns now?
[241:04.32]I have a gun.
[241:07.66]Let's throw the gun.
[241:10.22]Okay.
[241:10.72]Oh.
[241:11.50]I thought I could shoot the gun.
[241:13.00]Apparently not.
[241:13.64]Okay.
[241:25.57]Whoa!
[241:26.07]Okay, I see what I have to do.
[241:41.90]Hello.
[241:42.68]Hello.
[241:43.62]Look at me.
[241:44.64]Oh my god, you shot me through them.
[241:47.49]Ah, shit.
[241:57.85]Really?
[241:58.33]Okay, well, that's fine.
[242:01.33]Oh, I'll just do this.
[242:02.37]Is that... Oh, that turns on up there, too.
[242:09.96]Well, fuck.
[242:16.28]Alright, I'll turn this shit off.
[242:17.36]Let's go.
[242:22.28]Oh, yeah.
[242:24.94]I guess I gotta go around here.
[242:26.98]I guess I go over here.
[242:27.56]And then they're gonna wrap around.
[242:29.18]Okay, I got it.
[242:29.96]Ready?
[242:30.24]Three, two, one, go.
[242:36.22]Okay, here they come.
[242:39.28]Oh, shit.
[242:39.80]Oh, my God.
[242:49.11]Let me see that again.
[243:00.80]I have to see that again.
[243:02.22]Sometimes I do it.
[243:06.88]I mean, that was a mistake.
[243:08.56]Kind of.
[243:09.18]Sorry.
[243:12.79]Let's see.
[243:19.92]I don't even know who was what.
[243:23.78]My hoo-hoo-hoo.
[243:31.33]Oh, that.
[243:31.70]This is me thinking.
[243:32.42]Can I fast forward?
[243:51.69]Oops, okay.
[243:57.84]Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[243:59.42]Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[244:18.64]Where they going?
[244:19.65]Oh, fuck.
[244:20.29]Oh, God.
[244:21.37]Where they going?
[244:22.13]Oh, God.
[244:23.35]Oh, my God.
[244:24.11]Oh, my God.
[244:24.41]Where they going?
[244:26.38]Scooby-Doo shit, man.
[244:27.52]I swear to God.
[244:45.57]Oh my god, there's an explosion!
[244:46.61]What is gonna happen behind me?
[244:47.83]Wait a minute, what if I do this?
[245:00.11]I got it.
[245:00.87]I did it.
[245:27.92]One more guy with a gun.
[245:29.32]Guy down there.
[245:29.80]Okay, guy with a gun.
[245:30.90]Let's go.
[245:31.20]Guy with a gun.
[245:36.52]Gun.
[245:37.10]Okay.
[245:38.64]Half a door guy.
[245:54.01]Wow, I'm an idiot.
[245:55.19]Okay, I'm fine.
[246:00.93]That room sucked.
[246:05.76]Oh no, boss fight?
[246:08.34]Oh, you've arrived.
[246:10.88]I was hoping we'd be able to finish what we started.
[246:13.41]This should be fun.
[246:15.47]I guess it will be.
[246:22.85]Okay, I get you.
[246:24.06]Alright, I get you, fucking bullshit.
[246:38.63]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[246:41.44]Oh, they gotta die quick.
[246:43.96]Oh, they gotta die quick.
[247:09.33]Fuck!
[247:09.43]That was bad.
[247:09.69]I didn't slow the time down.
[247:12.73]Fuck.
[247:12.85]Come on.
[247:13.01]Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[247:14.13]Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
[247:30.13]I gotta dodge through that.
[247:35.13]Here she comes with that bullshit again!
[247:40.36]God damn it.
[247:41.16]That happens when you restart so quickly.
[248:13.11]Did it.
[248:13.79]Your... Start rescue helicopter.
[248:18.51]A man has fallen into the river.
[248:20.79]A man has fallen into the river.
[248:22.49]Lego, what are you doing?
[248:25.51]Who are you?
[248:25.99]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[248:29.82]You don't recognize the uniform.
[248:32.82]I thought 15 and I were the last.
[248:34.92]No, left.
[248:36.18]Alakazam paid me in Kronos to kill people.
[248:38.80]That's why you're here, right, Kronos?
[248:42.08]There's none here.
[248:43.08]I don't know where Alkasim Kept is, but it's not here.
[248:45.92]There's almost none left.
[248:46.88]Certainly not enough for both of us.
[248:50.20]Uh, there's not enough?
[248:51.46]What do you mean?
[248:54.34]You guys have gone full hollow.
[248:56.70]It's almost gone.
[248:57.30]The Null Project is over.
[248:58.46]If the government still has any, they certainly won't give it to us.
[249:01.40]The rotten afterbirth of a miscarried war.
[249:06.52]Maybe there's enough for one person, but not both of us.
[249:10.51]Uh, I'm not even here for that shit.
[249:13.87]Why else would you be here?
[249:14.94]There's nothing of value here.
[249:16.38]Nothing.
[249:16.74]This killing, this fight, it's been for nothing.
[249:20.42]Unless... You enjoy it, don't you?
[249:25.52]Killing, the immortality that Chronos gives us, the failsafe of time.
[249:28.61]It's why killing means nothing.
[249:30.27]Because when we die, we always go back.
[249:33.97]Killing is the only time we're able to touch that thing we were never able to have.
[249:41.37]This fight will go on forever until one of us surrenders.
[249:45.64]This battle is happening in our minds.
[249:47.52]It's a tournament of willpower.
[249:48.94]Every time you kill me, I understand a little bit better how to beat you.
[249:53.20]Oh, okay.
[249:54.16]After I finish you, I'll go after the people who did this to us.
[249:57.08]I promise.
[249:57.72]I won't let your death be in vain.
[249:59.32]They'll suffer.
[250:02.34]Are you in withdrawal?
[250:03.90]You're in withdrawal.
[250:05.72]It's been days since I've taken Kronos.
[250:07.40]Not since Al-Qasim died.
[250:08.78]You know what happens.
[250:12.47]The visions won't stop.
[250:13.51]You've killed me a thousand times to the point where I don't even feel it anymore.
[250:18.69]But maybe there's enough chronos in your bloodstream to slow down the withdrawal.
[250:23.90]You guys lost it completely.
[250:29.18]You guys have gone absolute full, complete hollow.
[250:32.94]What is going on in this chat?
[250:34.02]Everyone's freaking out.
[250:35.02]This is the real final boss.
[250:47.32]didn't touch it got it whoa okay that's not fair alright how come the ship's on the let's go oh I just watched you just teleport
[251:22.88]Oh my god.
[251:28.86]That's not even real.
[251:30.38]What?
[251:32.10]I've watched you make that mistake a hundred times.
[251:33.78]You can't outsmart me.
[251:34.64]There's no way for you to win this.
[251:36.22]I just keep dying over and over again until I fucking figure it out.
[251:44.11]Okay, let's go.
[251:46.77]How many times do I have to do this?
[251:52.44]Now here comes again this shit.
[251:53.68]Now the side.
[251:57.64]And then this one below.
[251:59.26]And then this- Fuck!
[252:01.54]And then she flips around.
[252:02.50]Ugh, this sucks.
[252:03.38]Alright, come on.
[252:17.53]Here it comes.
[252:17.91]Nothing in the middle, then she goes across.
[252:22.68]Down and then... Fuck me.
[252:59.28]Alright, here comes the bullshit that I keep fucking up.
[253:00.87]There it goes.
[253:06.43]I don't get... I can't... I don't understand.
[253:08.43]I'm gonna get hit by it no matter what.
[253:10.21]What?
[253:10.43]Do I have to dodge at the...
[253:30.20]Wait, what the?
[253:31.04]Oh, fuck.
[253:31.82]Okay, I'm safe there.
[253:33.94]She just blow herself up.
[253:40.37]God damn it.
[253:41.49]Is Kronos in your blood enough for me to make it one or two more days?
[253:45.37]Is she drinking my blood?
[253:55.76]I couldn't get over there fast enough.
[254:08.51]Oh, that was bullshit.
[254:09.67]Stupid fucking explosion from that dog shit.
[254:21.38]Fuck, I missed.
[254:23.64]Alright, here we go.
[254:24.60]Explode!
[254:24.94]She's going to blow up.
[254:27.18]Fuck.
[254:27.46]God, come on.
[254:28.58]What the fuck?
[254:32.09]Yikes.
[254:55.00]Oh, fuck.
[254:59.98]I can't... Why am I on the ground for that long?
[255:03.43]I'm getting sick of this.
[255:16.92]My chat... This could be the worst chat experience in the last 10 years.
[255:23.39]absolutely without a doubt this is absolutely without a doubt the worst chat experience in probably in 10 years holy shit oh my god I have to stay away when I hit her
[255:56.21]What am I doing?
[255:58.27]Not smart.
[255:58.81]Not smart.
[255:59.33]Not smart.
[256:05.15]Get the fuck out of here.
[256:10.42]Kill.
[256:11.40]Kill the people who did this to us.
[256:13.86]Kill them.
[256:14.44]Kill them.
[256:14.94]Kill them.
[256:15.44]Kill them.
[256:16.74]For me.
[256:19.63]Access denied.
[256:20.45]Retinal scan.
[256:21.17]Come here.
[256:25.99]Crush, kill, destroy.
[256:29.83]The final boss is full moon chat.
[256:36.04]Well, can I... Oh.
[256:37.92]Well, okay, I guess that makes sense.
[256:42.20]Open the door.
[256:47.30]Friday full moon.
[256:49.83]I don't even know.
[256:51.03]You guys have gone fucking crazy.
[257:02.69]Wait, it's me.
[257:09.08]Uh... Do I have to do this?
[257:11.58]What if I don't touch anything?
[257:21.40]I need to break the... I have to break the cycle.
[257:23.41]You know what I mean?
[257:27.13]If I keep... Yeah, this is going to be like a never-ending circle.
[257:33.60]You know, we would have fucking won if those goddamn hippies in the first district weren't bitching about the child killings.
[257:42.92]Oh, so it was... You literally murder everyone in the game.
[257:49.79]Okay, well, I'm not gonna do anything.
[257:50.77]I'm just gonna sit here.
[257:57.09]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[257:58.75]Nope.
[258:00.93]No, I don't think I will.
[258:16.99]What are you doing?
[258:18.11]Your targets are still alive.
[258:20.51]What the hell have you done?
[258:25.44]I didn't do it.
[258:28.90]You... do you understand what you've done?
[258:35.00]I haven't been able to reach my daughter all day.
[258:37.04]My phone, why do I still have this?
[258:43.06]I can't explain this.
[258:44.88]They won't come after me.
[258:45.80]I had nothing to do with this.
[258:48.50]He lied to me.
[258:49.86]The dreams were real.
[258:52.40]No, no, I'm leaving.
[258:53.34]I need to leave.
[258:54.26]There's no time.
[258:54.88]I need to get out of here.
[258:55.73]I gotta go.
[258:57.05]I gotta get out of here.
[258:58.23]You knew my dreams really happened.
[259:01.53]What?
[259:01.99]No, what the fuck are you talking about?

[269:32.58]Hold on.
[269:34.48]Okay, so I go back to Bunker Part 2.
[269:37.50]I go in.
[269:39.82]I cut him off.
[269:40.44]I say the dreams were real.
[269:42.80]Cut him off again.
[269:43.42]You knew it.
[269:44.22]Why can't I remember just all the red shit?
[269:51.44]Okay.
[269:52.50]Let's go.
[269:52.76]What do you mean, no, no?
[269:55.48]What do you mean, no, no, no, no?
[269:59.65]Remember, you basically have to piss off the psychiatrist every time you talk to him.
[270:10.73]It won't work.
[270:12.70]You have to constantly disrespect the therapist from the beginning of the game.
[270:16.42]Oh.
[270:17.98]It's read every time he talks to you.
[270:21.80]Oh.
[270:26.17]Oh.
[270:27.49]Okay.
[270:30.03]You only have to do it in the first few missions?
[270:31.55]Yeah, I mean, this is a... It'll take me four or five hours to go through it again.
[270:35.77]Not worth it.
[270:37.21]Nah, not worth it.
[270:38.29]Let me see what the boss is, though.
[270:45.03]Alright, he has like, alright, that's pretty crazy.
[270:51.13]Okay, this is fucking insane.
[270:55.93]This is actually, like, disturbing and fucked up.
[271:02.10]Takes like 20 minutes to get all this stuff.
[271:05.66]Wait, wait, wait, so you tell, hold on.
[271:08.28]Show it, show it.
[271:10.72]How fast reliably will it do?
[271:13.81]Can I do it reliably?
[271:19.79]Just look up a guide.
[271:20.64]You can do it all fast.
[271:22.82]15 to 20 minutes.
[271:24.32]Skip through all the tapes to where you talk to him.
[271:27.68]So start at the factory.
[271:32.35]And then... Oh, okay.
[271:34.39]So I have to just go to every time I talk to the therapist?
[271:36.47]I don't even remember what the hell...
[271:41.47]If you do everything correct, you just have to cut him off.
[271:43.23]You don't have to play through most of the game.
[271:48.57]We'll try it.
[271:49.89]Look, there's a guide.
[271:50.65]Okay, hold on.
[271:51.29]How to unlock the psychiatrist boss?
[271:56.01]Okay, Katana ZERO.
[271:57.90]You do not need to start a new game to complete this.
[271:59.60]It can be done even if you've beaten the game before.
[272:01.36]Simply go back to the levels and complete the event flags listed below.
[272:05.16]Okay, step one.
[272:07.10]Hang up in factory and ask for medicine.
[272:11.19]Play the factory level.
[272:12.09]At the very start of the mission, you'll get a phone call in the hallway.
[272:15.33]Continue to hang up until you've exhausted the interaction.
[272:18.57]Eventually, you need to answer the phone with hello.
[272:20.23]Okay, so just hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.
[272:23.47]Interrupt the psychiatrist and ask for medicine until he gives it to you.
[272:27.41]Alright, we'll do that.
[272:28.88]So, from the beginning of the game, right?
[272:33.46]I'm willing to try it.
[272:34.34]It shouldn't take too long.
[272:41.47]Game Boomers is for Nancy Drew only.
[272:43.17]This is not Game Boomers.
[272:44.17]Alright, from the beginning or from the middle?
[272:49.79]From the very beginning?
[272:50.35]Alright, hang up a bunch of times.
[272:53.37]And then tell them to fuck off.
[272:56.97]Let's go.
[272:58.07]So tell me again.
[272:58.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[272:59.41]Men in the masks.
[273:00.17]Uh-huh.
[273:00.51]Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.
[273:07.65]I'm bored already.
[273:08.37]Oh, we're not going to play through the whole game.
[273:10.67]I'm just going to do the specific things it wants me to do.
[273:12.69]Because I think there's only like three things to do.
[273:17.31]Go left.
[273:17.75]What do you mean go left?
[273:22.09]I couldn't.
[273:29.10]Go left.
[273:32.56]Picked up prism key.
[273:34.02]What the hell does that do?
[273:39.31]Prism key?
[273:42.25]It opens the prism.
[273:43.66]Right.
[273:43.90]Alright, hang up.
[273:56.72]Hello!
[273:58.43]Goodbye.
[273:58.77]Uh, goodbye.
[274:12.67]How many times do I have to do this?
[274:15.11]Stop!
[274:19.35]Stop!
[274:19.59]Oh jeez, I almost missed that one.
[274:20.79]How many times do I have to do this?
[274:35.99]The guide says do it 15 times.
[274:37.61]Are you serious?
[274:44.90]It's done?
[274:45.30]It's done?
[274:45.62]It's done.
[274:48.00]Hello?
[274:48.30]This is not the time for games, damn it.
[274:53.01]Listen closely.
[274:53.67]Alright, so now... Hang up and ask for medicine.
[274:56.27]Alright.
[275:02.00]Just keep telling him to fuck off.
[275:04.08]Get on with it.
[275:06.08]Interrupt the psychiatrist, ask for medicine until he gives it to you.
[275:08.10]Good.
[275:08.52]Okay.
[275:09.60]Let's go.
[275:14.75]It's time for Five Nights at Freddy's.
[275:16.93]What?
[275:20.31]Alright, let me just get through this quickly.
[275:21.95]Do I have to- Okay, do I have to play through this?
[275:24.96]Or do I- Can I just leave?
[275:25.96]Like, can I just leave the game right now?
[275:31.54]And just do the rest of the stuff?
[275:34.12]You can just exit out.
[275:36.90]Save and quit.
[275:37.98]Just main menu?
[275:40.22]You can leave.
[275:40.64]You can leave.
[275:41.06]Okay.
[275:42.18]Dude, so, alright.
[275:42.90]You can leave and then go to the meeting in the tape.
[275:45.88]Oh, alright.
[275:46.30]Okay, let's go main menu.
[275:49.39]Continue.
[275:52.61]Continue previous level.
[275:53.89]If level progress be lost if no is selected.
[275:56.15]Wait.
[275:56.97]Is this gonna work?
[275:57.43]Should I just say no and pick it?
[276:03.09]You can main menu each... No.
[276:04.75]Hold on.
[276:05.39]Auto wants to leave.
[276:05.97]Hold on.
[276:31.08]Okay.
[276:31.92]Sorry, he was like, let me out!
[276:34.59]He was just hanging out back here.
[276:36.51]Sleeping.
[276:37.93]Okay, so, did we determine if- do I have to beat this?
[276:41.93]Or should I just continue and beat this level first, or what?
[276:45.13]Have we figured that out?
[276:49.42]Press no.
[276:52.03]Okay, so factory.
[276:53.93]And then go to the end.
[276:59.19]So go here.
[277:02.03]Okay.
[277:04.26]And then just keep telling him to fuck off.
[277:15.58]Sleep.
[277:15.96]Go to the appointment and say, give me drugs, give me drugs, give me drugs.
[277:26.65]Alright, that's actually not that much left.
[277:40.45]So, anger the receptionist and ask for medicine.
[277:42.59]This is after this.
[277:55.10]Here we go.
[277:55.48]Please, come in and take a seat.
[277:56.94]Yes.
[277:58.62]Give me drugs.
[277:59.98]You look well, despite last night's circumstances.
[278:02.09]Shall we begin?
[278:02.65]Just give me my medicine.
[278:05.95]I just want the medicine.
[278:06.73]It's wearing out.
[278:08.67]Just give it to me.
[278:15.76]Okay.
[278:19.38]Is he going to give it to me?
[278:22.68]Give me the drugs.
[278:24.67]Okay.
[278:25.71]Now make your way to the level and go to the hotel.
[278:28.36]And anger the receptionist.
[278:31.56]Just repeatedly interrupt her.
[278:33.40]Once you've made her angry, complete the mission.
[278:36.34]This results... Oh.
[278:38.57]Okay.
[278:46.55]Ooh.
[278:46.63]Ooh.
[278:53.41]Alright, let's go.
[278:55.13]There's only, like, two more things after this.
[279:02.50]So, to make her angry, angry, angry, angry.
[279:07.06]And then beat the mission.
[279:10.69]Stare blankly.
[279:12.31]Wow, that... Let me go.
[279:14.29]Stop talking to me.
[279:15.95]Shut up.
[279:17.35]Shut up.
[279:19.45]That's it!
[279:20.31]I don't need this right now.
[279:21.55]Get out of my face.
[279:26.02]Okay.
[279:28.48]Complete the mission.
[279:33.35]So I have to beat the mission now?
[279:35.65]Let's go.
[279:36.05]I'll do it very quickly.
[279:45.83]Here they come!
[279:50.54]Boss!
[279:51.20]The dragon's here!
[279:52.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[279:52.92]Raise the alarm.
[279:56.65]It's just level two, how hard could it be?
[279:58.11]Not very hard.
[280:07.79]Yes, that should work.
[280:19.21]Go, go, go, go, go.
[280:29.33]Jerma, stop pretending.
[280:31.51]I'm playing a game.
[280:34.49]Hey, what's that?
[280:35.23]Oh, yeah.
[280:35.89]Oh, nothing.
[280:48.02]And...
[280:59.79]Smooth!
[281:00.61]This game is way easier when you've already beat it.
[281:23.79]And we beat level 2, look at that.
[281:29.63]Now, last time, do we just throw him off?
[281:33.53]I understand why you're here.
[281:34.93]I'm not going to let you get rid of him, right?
[281:38.25]Just kill him.
[281:38.77]Just be bad.
[281:39.31]Just be an asshole.
[281:40.07]Okay, cool.
[281:45.11]Alright, now interrupt the psychiatrist over and over again.
[281:52.47]I'm getting there.
[281:52.91]I only have a couple more things to do.
[282:01.78]You missed the ass-eating scene.
[282:03.58]Oh no, too bad.
[282:05.88]Stop!
[282:06.36]There are reports of gunfire in this building.
[282:08.06]Who are you?
[282:11.50]That's him.
[282:12.30]He's the guy.
[282:15.34]What the fuck?
[282:16.66]Oh, we have to... The receptionist of the murderer hotel has been eliminated due to your lack of discretion.
[282:34.16]Please minimize collateral damage in the future.
[282:37.21]Okay, this is where we now, uh, after the mission, do a psychiatrist session.
[282:43.03]Interrupt the psychiatrist just until he gives him a medicine.
[282:48.69]Okay.
[282:55.89]Okay, I'm busy.
[282:56.51]Oof.
[283:02.58]In other news, time to go to sleep.
[283:05.76]I can't sleep without my tea, really.
[283:13.12]Okay, go to bed.
[283:16.29]There's two more things to do.
[283:18.51]Okay, interrupt until he gives you medicine, then you have to speak to the DJ.
[283:30.56]Just let the man have his tea!
[283:39.36]I already did the DJ, you can skip that part.
[283:41.68]So if it's already been done, I don't have to do it?
[283:52.62]Give me my shot, shut up.
[284:00.75]Okay, hang up the phone call right before the DJ booth and then speak to the DJ regarding the drugs.
[284:06.15]Okay.
[284:07.27]I actually do have to do this again.
[284:13.90]I have to hang up on him.
[284:17.36]I don't kill... Okay, yeah.
[284:18.82]You saw how quickly I did that last one.
[284:20.10]Let's go.
[284:27.93]Okay, so we only have a few more things to do here.
[284:30.23]Alright, during the mission, hang up the phone call right before the booth and then speak to the DJ.
[284:36.69]Do not kill the DJ.
[284:37.65]You got it.
[284:37.97]Let's go.
[285:01.45]Get over there! Get over there, Jesus!
[285:14.69]Hey! Hey you you're not supposed to-
[285:27.57]Oh, please.
[285:32.92]PepoDance, fool.
[285:33.94]PepoDance, fool.
[285:35.00]Ooh, I'm gonna blend it in with the background.
[285:45.84]Jesus, what the fuck am I doing?
[285:48.02]Hang up.
[286:02.65]Shit, that guy has a gun down there, fuck.
[286:17.35]Shoot!
[286:27.03]Can't see me, can't see me, can't see me, go!
[286:47.94]That should work.
[286:49.16]I left a few hours ago, he's still in the nightclub?
[286:50.80]Yeah, this place is fucking hard, man.
[286:52.50]This is hard as shit.
[287:08.52]Oh, that would've been cool.
[287:09.36]I missed it though.
[287:42.91]Oh, look at this SPAMSH!
[287:45.25]What?
[287:53.00]Remember how much trouble this gave you before?
[287:55.14]I don't know why it is.
[287:56.46]It just does.
[288:05.56]Oh my god, Jeremy.
[288:15.64]Mm-hmm.
[288:16.80]Whoa, is it dead?
[288:17.66]I almost thought it wasn't dead.
[288:18.92]What the fuck?
[288:26.67]Before.
[288:27.27]Oh, mega LOL.
[288:29.69]Alright, here we go.
[288:30.23]Hang up.
[288:32.97]Fuck you.
[288:33.29]Hang up.
[288:34.23]Talk to this person.
[288:35.37]Only talk.
[288:35.81]Don't kill.
[288:39.40]It's me.
[288:43.58]Are you real?
[288:44.94]I'm here to kill you.
[288:48.52]Oh, fuck.
[288:49.10]Oh, fuck.
[288:49.66]Oh, fuck.
[288:50.40]You are real.
[288:51.16]Okay, man.
[288:52.08]Stay cool.
[288:53.82]I'll give it all back.
[288:54.56]Oh, what are you talking about?
[289:00.08]yours oh god uh what did you find your shit man the drugs I only tried it once at a party it was wild yep yep yep yep yep uh tell me where it is alright so I mean it's still in your storage unit
[289:28.32]Complete the level after this.
[289:30.48]After you've spoken with the DJ, there's another session.
[289:33.91]During the session, you need to refuse your medicine.
[289:37.73]To do this, simply choose the dialog about the drug.
[289:42.29]Eventually, you will be able to refuse the drug and the psychiatrist will tell you to get out of his office.
[289:53.62]Okay.
[289:54.36]To do this, simply choose the dialog about the drug.
[289:58.60]You boys are dead.
[290:01.90]Oh, fuck.
[290:02.30]Don't hurt me.
[290:04.48]Look, man.
[290:05.04]Let's make a deal.
[290:06.18]I'll cut you some of the drugs if you let me go.
[290:09.96]I'll do anything.
[290:12.71]Uh, give me the drugs and you can go.
[290:15.91]Cool, cool, cool, dude.
[290:17.01]Okay.
[290:17.11]Okay.
[290:21.71]Okay.
[290:24.93]During the session, you need to refuse your medicine.
[290:26.57]Just choose the option above the drug.
[290:39.36]Okay.
[290:41.67]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[290:44.43]Somebody else coming from behind, right?
[290:46.67]Yep.
[290:54.00]Time to go.
[290:57.03]Our employees are not aware of the circumstances behind Electra Head's death.
[291:01.30]I am.
[291:01.84]You have been negligent in your duties.
[291:04.94]Future deviants will be met with strict discipline.
[291:07.24]Okay, let's skip all this shit.
[291:11.40]I mean, this is not shit, you know.
[291:18.83]Just be mean.
[291:28.31]Why am I playing this still?
[291:29.35]Because I'm trying to see the last bit of it.
[291:31.45]There's a secret boss that I want to see, and I have to do two more small things and I can do it.
[291:46.00]Under the bed, right?
[291:46.80]Under the sofa.
[291:52.02]About it.
[291:52.30]I just want to see the secret boss.
[292:00.97]See, I knew it.
[292:02.43]You had them all along.
[292:03.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[292:06.40]Okay, cool.
[292:15.60]She doesn't deserve this.
[292:17.50]Well, this is a different timeline.
[292:19.83]This is a different timeline.
[292:21.01]Don't worry.
[292:27.67]So now after this, we have to skip...
[292:30.90]We have to kill all the officers during the prison level, which, okay, that's... And then that's it.
[292:36.57]You're gonna play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[292:49.46]No.
[293:01.04]How about Five Nights at Freddy's VR?
[293:10.70]I have to ask about the drug.
[293:13.47]And then refuse the medicine.
[293:17.01]Take a seat.
[293:17.37]Alright.
[293:19.01]Ask about the drug.
[293:22.41]I'm not so sure I share the sentiment.
[293:25.23]Maybe you could answer a few questions for me.
[293:27.44]When did you start using a gun?
[293:28.60]I don't use a gun.
[293:30.89]Answer my questions first.
[293:34.65]That's not how this works.
[293:35.48]You're going to tell me what happened last night at the Club Neon.
[293:39.72]Uh, I spoke to a lecture head.
[293:43.12]I specifically told you not to do that!
[293:44.88]Alright, now we talk about the drug.
[293:50.61]Don't, uh, refuse the medicine.
[293:52.41]He told me about a drug that sounds like mine.
[293:57.07]It very likely may have been, and that is the purpose of our mission.
[294:00.09]To ensure that this drug does not reach the wrong hands.
[294:04.84]Why didn't you want me to know about the drug?
[294:06.14]What do you mean I ruined it?
[294:09.36]It says, it says refuse the drug.
[294:11.16]What are you guys talking about?
[294:16.30]As a veteran, you should understand that you are not privy to the full details of our missions.
[294:21.02]My powers come from a drug?
[294:25.33]I don't want that.
[294:26.01]I don't want this.
[294:27.17]No, I don't want the drug anymore.
[294:28.51]Enough!
[294:28.69]It's time for your treatment!
[294:32.05]Sit still!
[294:32.27]No.
[294:57.19]Do you understand the gift you've been given?
[294:59.68]You are invincible.
[295:03.72]So, what if it comes from a drug?
[295:05.62]You hold the power of a god, you see the future.
[295:07.40]How dare you squander this gift.
[295:09.66]Now sit.
[295:11.30]No.
[295:15.66]Leave.
[295:16.41]Don't come back until you're capable of doing your damn job.
[295:20.37]Oh, and one last thing.
[295:22.09]Are you aware that the media has taken to calling you the dragon?
[295:26.53]Do you know what the media should be calling you?
[295:29.99]Fucking nothing.
[295:31.35]Exercise some goddamn discretion and stop drawing attention to us.
[295:35.20]Now get out of here, you stinking idiot.
[295:37.48]I'm a pretty good actor.
[295:38.34]I could fucking act.
[295:39.06]Okay.
[295:42.06]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[295:47.74]Well, this is different.
[295:50.17]Alright, so now...
[295:52.88]Kill all the police officers during the prison mission, which is this one.
[295:55.90]So, I'll just hang up.
[295:57.98]Fuck off.
[295:59.91]Okay.
[296:01.81]I have to kill everything.
[296:03.45]Everyone has to die.
[296:09.75]And then this is it.
[296:20.22]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[296:23.87]Yeah, we don't need to see that.
[296:26.13]Just kill everything, everybody, all things.
[296:32.71]Full moon tonight.
[296:34.31]Uh-huh.
[296:42.13]Oh no, he's dead!
[296:48.53]Here we go.
[297:07.41]Is that all?
[297:07.87]That's it, right?
[297:14.37]That should work.
[297:14.79]1, 2, 3, 4.
[297:18.48]That's it.
[297:34.84]Video feed lost?
[297:35.76]What?
[297:36.12]Yeah.
[297:39.11]Nobody else?
[297:39.57]Wait, anybody in this room?
[297:43.03]No.
[297:44.71]He's bloodthirsty.
[297:45.67]He's absolutely fucking bloodthirsty.
[297:48.11]Kind of.
[297:49.33]In the game.
[297:58.93]Alright, they're all dead, right?
[298:01.35]I think that's it.
[298:11.25]Okay.
[298:13.41]This results in you directly obeying the orders.
[298:15.13]Okay, the final thing is tell the psychiatrist to fuck you during the Chinatown session.
[298:20.46]After you've done all the steps above, make your way to the Chinatown mission and start the session with the psychiatrist.
[298:25.50]Tell him to fuck you when the option presents itself.
[298:30.82]Here we go.
[298:32.87]Should I be... Alright, so I can get out, right?
[298:54.53]Okay.
[298:58.92]Kill?
[298:59.18]I don't have to.
[298:59.62]Alright, Chinatown mission.
[299:05.08]Is that the next one or what?
[299:06.10]What is this?
[299:10.17]Picked up prototype key.
[299:25.06]I hate doing this, but I have to.
[299:26.44]Yeah, I've already seen this.
[299:31.44]Bro, bro, bro, dude.
[299:43.49]Chinatown mission.
[299:45.29]And then say, fuck you.
[299:54.95]You don't have to be mean.
[299:56.33]Well, if I'm not mean to the girl, then we have to sit through, like, ten times more dialog.
[300:13.00]Oh, he's got the pliers.
[300:16.30]I can't believe this blue shit is his hair.
[300:18.02]Oh, I thought it was a helmet.
[300:19.60]Is it really?
[300:33.55]I guess it is, because the sideburns.
[300:34.99]Okay.
[300:37.76]Alright.
[300:38.92]I think it's time.
[300:39.50]Here we go.
[300:55.05]Ow.
[300:56.45]Chinatown is in five levels?
[300:58.94]Alright, well, I'll just leave, and then go to Chinatown and do it.
[301:04.75]Let's see if it works.
[301:08.39]Okay, six days remain.
[301:11.25]Chinatown.
[301:14.49]Yeah, alright.
[301:15.01]Let's go back.
[301:16.09]Main menu.
[301:16.67]Now continue.
[301:21.09]And then go to the Chinatown mission.
[301:27.23]Chinatown.
[301:30.86]Say, fuck you.
[301:35.63]There it is, right?
[301:40.41]Get the better sword.
[301:41.46]Um... Does it... Turn a new sword.
[301:50.46]Can I get a new sword?
[301:53.33]Go to the lab for the new sword.
[301:54.79]I don't know that exists.
[301:57.17]Government lab has a different sword.
[302:03.51]Do it after.
[302:04.19]Do it after.
[302:04.75]You do now.
[302:05.56]Do now.
[302:06.18]Do this now.
[302:07.58]You got a key for it.
[302:08.42]I'm doing this now.
[302:11.02]What the hell were you doing last night?
[302:13.36]Fuck you.
[302:15.26]There are two dozen wrecked motorcycles.
[302:19.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[302:21.19]Whatever.
[302:22.67]He's dead.
[302:25.09]I know!
[302:25.69]He was found with a goddamn bullet in his head.
[302:28.61]It's also all over the news.
[302:29.94]You can't keep...
[302:31.97]Do you understand the discretion of our mission?
[302:36.03]Look at me.
[302:36.71]This is an elaborate advertisement for your services.
[302:41.33]While our supervisors saw and they were... Fuck you.
[302:46.80]Ah, fuck you too.
[302:49.20]I guess I don't look so great now.
[302:50.70]Wait, what?
[302:55.30]It doesn't even compare to what's in store for you.
[302:56.94]What are you talking about?
[302:58.52]Did I miss the prompt?
[302:59.74]You really don't know.
[303:02.55]No, I cut back to the... I cut back, don't I?
[303:06.63]Oh, it's fuck you to the psychiatrist here.
[303:07.97]Okay.
[303:13.76]The real dragon.
[303:14.90]Oh, he gave me the drugs!
[303:16.68]Fuck you.
[303:21.08]Get your dosser on the way out and act like a goddamn professional.
[303:25.01]The name almost would be humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives.
[303:31.09]I am not the dragon.
[303:34.42]How preposterous of me.
[303:35.48]Of course you're not responsible for the rash, highly visible third district murders.
[303:38.88]Yeah, yeah.
[303:39.30]When do I get to say fuck you?
[303:41.30]Not all of them.
[303:41.84]I met the dragon.
[303:47.80]When?
[303:48.26]On the highway.
[303:52.28]I was not expecting that.
[303:53.34]Uh-huh.
[303:53.64]Who is this person?
[303:55.64]Uh, he was inhumanly fast.
[303:59.16]Did I miss my opportunity to do it?
[304:05.25]No, he just was the dragon.
[304:06.09]He was after the people.
[304:06.75]He... He just was the... No, he just... Just that he was the dragon.
[304:12.98]I see.
[304:13.26]Very good, very good.
[304:13.98]Okay, okay, okay.
[304:16.74]I had other plans, but who is he?
[304:20.18]Clearly a menace.
[304:23.22]Yeah, you are the treading on very thin ice.
[304:24.98]Fuck you.
[304:30.36]What?
[304:32.12]Get the hell out of here now!
[304:41.34]Did it work?
[304:47.71]Did I do it?
[304:51.95]Stay the hell away from there.
[304:52.84]I think I did it.
[304:54.70]Okay.
[304:55.92]If you've done all the steps up to this point, you can see if you did it.
[304:59.45]Go to the psychiatrist session in the bunker.
[305:02.65]During this session, the psychiatrist will tell you something different.
[305:05.51]He will say, I'm almost disappointed that you're still alive after what you put me through.
[305:09.50]If you get this dialog, it means you have done it.
[305:14.92]Okay.
[305:15.70]So we go... We just... Complete this?
[305:25.78]Just go to bunker part two.
[305:26.96]Okay.
[305:28.54]Okay.
[305:34.35]If I go to the lab, will it fuck it up?
[305:38.77]No.
[305:43.99]Get the sword.
[305:44.57]Where's the sword?
[305:45.33]So if I go here and then here, it's not gonna screw it all up.
[305:48.35]Go get the cool sword.
[305:49.23]Alright, I'll get the cool sword.
[305:50.35]Whatever.
[306:00.13]Okay, this opened.
[306:02.96]Pick the prism sword.
[306:03.85]The world is your canvas and blood is the paint.
[306:07.33]Okay.
[306:09.23]What's this?
[306:10.79]I have two keys, right?
[306:17.25]Uh, the claymore prototype.
[306:18.63]Giant cleaver that crushes bullets and defenses.
[306:25.86]I want the big one.
[306:27.60]I want the huge one.
[306:28.88]Yeah, give me this thing.
[306:34.70]I have it on, right?
[306:35.40]Alright, yeah, I want the big one.
[306:39.82]Big sword, let's go.
[306:40.72]Bunker part two.
[306:46.56]During this interaction, you can get two possible outcomes.
[306:48.72]The outcome we will get is a boss fight.
[306:51.96]When you walk towards the psychiatrist, he will say, you're making a very big mistake.
[306:57.13]Okay.
[307:02.27]Bunker part two.
[307:05.72]Spoilers.
[307:07.52]Here it is.
[307:19.77]You... Do you understand what you've done?
[307:22.59]You're making... I haven't been able to reach my daughter all day.
[307:28.59]My phone.
[307:29.21]Why did I still have this?
[307:33.92]I can explain this.
[307:35.68]They won't come after me.
[307:36.70]I had nothing to do with this shit.
[307:39.36]No, I'm leaving.
[307:40.22]I need to... You knew my dreams were real, you motherfucker.
[307:43.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[307:48.90]Get the hell out of my office, you goddamn junkie.
[307:54.61]What are you gonna do?
[307:55.39]You're in withdrawal.
[307:56.21]Get away from me.
[307:57.97]Wait.
[308:02.25]I fucked it up?
[308:06.45]You need to finish the first level after hanging up.
[308:15.47]Go back?
[308:16.95]And do it from bunker one?
[308:24.53]You have to start... Take it from the top?
[308:26.63]No.
[308:31.26]No, I don't.
[308:37.48]I think I have to go to the first part.
[308:39.28]Just do the first level again.
[308:42.50]No, I don't.
[308:43.40]Just redo one?
[308:44.42]Bunker part one?
[308:52.97]Because it says, if you're down all the steps, you can see... During the session, go to the bunker session with the psychiatrist.
[309:00.99]It'll say, I'm almost disappointed that you're still alive.
[309:09.34]Please come in.
[309:10.30]Okay.
[309:14.63]So you're still alive.
[309:15.55]I was beginning to wonder.
[309:16.61]Not that it matters because you've gone completely out of control.
[309:24.47]Failing to kill your target and murdering an entire police squad.
[309:26.95]I'm surprised you even decided to come back.
[309:28.85]That's not working.
[309:31.09]You fucking idiot.
[309:32.55]Yeah, this is your last chance.
[309:34.21]I don't think it worked.
[309:40.11]Maybe you can't do it out of order.
[309:42.43]How do you know about that?
[309:43.85]I've killed him.
[309:46.19]Need factory part one.
[309:48.15]I did factory part one.
[309:49.41]I hung up on him.
[309:50.93]I started from the very beginning.
[309:53.39]Did the lab fuck it up?
[309:55.63]You can do it out of order.
[309:56.41]Yeah, apparently I can.
[309:57.27]I've got a cool sword, though.
[310:00.55]Okay.
[310:04.05]Can I do this?
[310:11.26]This is correct.
[310:11.92]Don't listen to chat.
[310:13.44]You have to finish the level after hanging up on the factory.
[310:24.11]You need 15 hang-ups!
[310:27.23]Just finish the first level?
[310:33.29]Go to the speedrun mode and select the secret... Are you fucking kidding me?
[310:58.25]It's not in here.
[311:01.97]You need to play... You need to... No, it says it's not in here.
[311:07.93]Cancel.
[311:11.37]Why are you listening to everyone in chat?
[311:12.71]I mean, I have the source up here and I did everything and it didn't do anything.
[311:18.72]Step one.
[311:19.28]You have to... Okay, I'm going to try to play through the factory level.
[311:30.17]Hang up on him a bunch of times, and then finish the factory level.
[311:32.89]That makes sense, right?
[311:38.85]Did you get an achievement after hanging up?
[311:40.19]I did.
[311:40.41]I did get the achievement, but maybe I have to finish the mission.
[311:51.14]I was doing it.
[311:51.58]Yeah, I had it right.
[311:57.63]That guy was wrong.
[311:58.17]The lab didn't fuck it up.
[311:59.03]You're fine.
[311:59.47]Well, how come it didn't work?
[312:05.29]Did I do the factory therapy?
[312:06.93]The guide says I don't have to do it.
[312:09.92]Well, let's just see what happens when I finish the mission.
[312:11.98]See if I can do it.
[312:21.27]Boss doesn't exist.
[312:22.23]Hang on.
[312:30.72]Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven Thirteen Fourteen
[313:01.10]15.
[313:01.24]There you go.
[313:02.28]That's 15 times.
[313:04.36]I've done it.
[313:07.48]Okay.
[313:08.00]Hello.
[313:10.74]Okay.
[313:12.75]Alright.
[313:13.65]Get on with it.
[313:14.71]Get on with it.
[313:16.29]Get on with it, get on with it, get on with it.
[313:22.35]After this mission, interrupt the psychiatrist and ask for medicine until he gives it to you.
[313:25.56]I got it to be the mission.
[313:28.70]What do you mean I didn't?
[313:29.54]How did I ruin it?
[313:32.02]I have to actually beat this mission because there's something after it too.
[313:34.31]Okay.
[313:35.25]Let's see if that works.
[313:36.47]This is the last time I'm going to try it.
[313:37.83]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[313:38.69]If you're wondering what the hell is he doing, why is he skipping everything?
[313:41.05]Why is this guy such a stupid idiot?
[313:42.31]Dumb fucking idiot person.
[313:44.29]Pet cat?
[313:44.79]Yep.
[313:45.97]Well, it's because I'm trying to... I beat the game already.
[313:48.69]I'm just trying to get the secret boss.
[313:58.59]So after the mission...
[314:01.62]Just interrupt and ask for the medicine.
[314:03.60]And that should do it.
[314:04.36]And that should be able to go to the second bunker.
[314:18.93]What an embarrassment.
[314:19.76]Worst...
[314:49.07]Goodbye.
[314:51.05]Hey!
[314:52.91]We need to go now.
[314:55.09]I think you're right.
[314:55.63]I think I can stand.
[314:56.27]Hold on.
[314:59.71]Oh, I was starting to think I wouldn't make it.
[315:00.79]Thank you.
[315:04.04]What?
[315:13.02]Okay.
[315:13.58]Okay.
[315:15.15]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[315:23.51]Mine the lasers.
[315:25.85]Watch out for those lasers.
[315:26.94]Alright.
[315:27.94]Give me my medicine now.
[315:40.95]Drink the tea, go to sleep.
[315:42.47]And hopefully this is gonna be it.
[315:59.21]This is the text that I didn't get.
[316:00.53]I feel like I did though.
[316:13.25]Did I?
[316:21.86]Here we go.
[316:22.44]Okay.
[316:24.24]So just interrupt him until I get my medicine.
[316:26.50]Just say, give me my medicine.
[316:29.46]Bad behavior.
[316:32.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[316:35.02]Let's begin the session.
[316:37.14]I'm just here for the medicine.
[316:38.69]Give me the medicine.
[316:40.51]It's wearing out.
[316:41.15]Just give it to me.
[316:49.69]Okay.
[317:00.72]Okay.
[317:03.76]That should do it.
[317:04.70]Let's go to bunker two now.
[317:07.83]Okay.
[317:13.17]Okay.
[317:19.05]We're gonna get some winks soon.
[317:22.03]Possibly.
[317:22.55]Okay, bunker two.
[317:29.14]Let's hope it worked.
[317:32.66]Because I did everything else on this list.
[317:38.66]Go to the Chinatown mission and start the session with the psychiatrist.
[317:42.46]And then say, fuck you.
[317:46.06]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, the Bunker 2, wait, no, where am I?
[317:51.06]Actually, okay, Bunker 2, yes.
[317:56.90]You, do you understand what you've done?
[317:59.02]I, I haven't been able to reach my daughter.
[318:13.86]I can't explain this.
[318:14.94]They won't come after me.
[318:17.66]Nothing to do... You lied to me.
[318:19.50]I don't think this happened.
[318:21.73]No, I'm leaving.
[318:22.45]I need to leave.
[318:23.09]There's no time.
[318:23.83]Should I just let them go?
[318:25.97]You lied to me.
[318:28.35]What the fuck are you talking about?
[318:35.15]Get the hell out of my office.
[318:37.05]No, it didn't work.
[318:39.74]You're making a very big mistake.
[318:41.36]Oh!
[318:42.84]There it is!
[318:44.00]Alright, let's go!
[318:46.74]You idiot.
[318:47.68]You fucking idiot.
[318:48.44]Did you really think Kronos was the only drug government developed for the war?
[318:54.08]I should have done this a long time ago.
[319:00.75]Let's go!
[319:01.41]I will suffer you no more.
[319:04.39]Here we go.
[319:07.35]Time for the secret final boss of the video game.
[319:10.03]Let's go.
[319:25.15]Hit the hands?
[319:25.61]I just gotta hit the hands.
[319:32.42]He's getting mad.
[319:35.36]Oh, he just blew up my fucking head.
[319:37.04]He just exploded my head.
[319:46.31]Oh fuck, they come out at different times.
[320:08.72]How many times do I have to do it?
[320:13.08]There we go.
[320:13.82]Oh fuck.
[320:15.96]Oh my god.
[320:16.74]Okay, he's been... Alright, what am I doing?

[320:40.78]The big sword is slow.
[320:43.44]Is that what's going on?
[320:56.29]I'm alright.
[321:04.32]Fuck you!
[321:04.98]I hit him!
[321:16.69]Jesus.
[321:18.98]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[321:43.26]I have to just dodge that shit You can't hit more than once Impossible I have to dodge

[322:39.47]Here we go.
[322:48.39]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[322:50.39]What happens if I don't... Oh my God.

[323:30.85]There it comes.
[323:34.55]He's... this thing.

[326:07.24]Oh, come on.

[332:50.06]For the love of God.
[332:50.68]Or do I have to do this shit like four times in a row?
[333:03.10]I'm fucked.
[333:20.40]Hey!
[333:20.86]HEY!
[333:21.12]I did it?
[333:22.66]What?
[333:22.84]I did it?
[333:26.64]How did I do it?
[333:27.50]What?
[333:27.72]That was not- I didn't do it?
[333:29.16]Did I do it?
[333:29.56]It was three?
[333:38.23]Oh shit, I did it.
[333:39.25]Hey!
[333:41.99]Alright!
[333:43.51]We got a keycard!
[333:46.19]Alright, that was fucking really crazy.
[333:56.15]That sucked.
[333:58.83]Desk.
[333:59.41]Oh.
[334:08.28]Chronos delivery.
[334:09.36]Yeah, I think I already did this, right?
[334:12.22]The dossier is me.
[334:13.18]Alright, let's go back to the lab.
[334:16.38]I didn't think I was going to be able to do that one.
[334:25.52]Wait, what do you mean, no?
[334:26.50]What are you talking about?
[334:27.70]I didn't do it?
[334:29.74]Do hard mode, secret boss.
[334:31.62]I am not qualified to do that.
[334:36.02]I'll tell you right now, I'm probably not qualified to do that.
[334:38.64]There may be some other gamers here that you've seen in the past that are probably very qualified.
[334:43.35]I'm not qualified for that.
[334:44.57]Okay.
[334:50.93]Okay.
[334:55.38]Let's go back to the lab.
[334:58.39]Wait, did you say Joel was doing Jump King?
[335:01.81]Are you serious?
[335:03.49]Are you serious?
[335:05.85]Yes?
[335:06.97]Oh, yeah.
[335:07.93]Oh, yeah.
[335:08.57]Oh, yeah.
[335:09.19]Oh, yeah.
[335:10.01]Oh, yeah.
[335:10.93]How's it going?
[335:12.11]How's that going?
[335:12.81]Let's see.
[335:18.19]Let's see how that's going.
[335:20.51]How's that going?
[335:27.80]I'm sure it's some local issue or whatever.
[335:30.76]He just fell to the bottom.
[335:31.70]Does the game run better if I'm not having it in a window like this?
[335:36.56]He's at the first screen.
[335:37.62]He's literally at the first screen.
[335:38.70]Okay, I'm going to go watch Joel.
[335:40.58]I'm leaving.
[335:41.22]See you tomorrow.
[335:42.49]I have to watch this.
[335:43.59]You know what I mean?
[335:44.17]I have to watch this.
[335:44.83]I have to.
[335:46.15]Alright.
[335:50.03]I'm going to go get a pizza and watch this.
[335:51.59]I can't wait.
[335:52.35]I get to be on the end.
[335:53.19]I get to be on this end.
[335:54.71]On your end.
[335:55.23]Oh, I can't wait.
[335:59.21]I'll see you tomorrow.
[336:01.93]That's pretty much all I want.
[336:02.65]That was Katana ZERO.
[336:03.43]Pretty good game.
[336:04.67]Pretty good game, you know?
[336:07.30]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[336:08.12]What about the keycard?
[336:11.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[336:11.84]I didn't put it in?
[336:20.16]Oh, shit.
[336:22.52]I don't think I have it.
[336:25.48]What about the bits?
[336:26.18]No, no, we'll do the bits.
[336:26.90]We'll do the bits.
[336:28.24]I'm just saying.
[336:29.38]Like, that's the end of the stream.
[336:30.20]Yeah, it's been about six hours.
[336:31.20]Alright, well, this was highly recommended, and I can see why.
[336:34.78]It was very fun.
[336:36.38]Story was kind of all over the place, hard to follow sometimes, but it was still cool.
[336:39.13]I like the combat.
[336:42.27]I'd like to see more of just playing the game.
[336:48.87]I wish that... Alright, so the game was about, what, four and a half hours or so?
[336:52.93]I wish it was, uh...
[336:55.65]I wish it was more just fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight in... I don't know.
[336:59.87]Maybe I'm asking too much.
[337:02.39]Swing with the Prism Sword?
[337:05.27]I mean, that's pretty cool.
[337:11.74]That's speedrun mode?
[337:12.76]Well, I mean, I would... I guess I wanted more video game.
[337:16.18]I mean, but that usually, typically means I liked it.
[337:19.10]I like the mechanics.
[337:20.72]Maybe the DLC will add a bunch more, we'll see.
[337:23.70]Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[337:24.36]I'm going to start the PlayStation 2... PlayStation 2... Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring.
[337:32.43]I'm only playing it because one person said that they guaranteed I would not be the first level.
[337:37.14]So we're going to prove one person wrong.
[337:40.34]That's the plan tomorrow.
[337:45.36]Thanks for watching.
[337:46.82]Definitely worst chat experience of 2015 through 2020.
[337:49.70]I hope you guys are proud of that.
[337:52.90]Full moon chat.
[337:54.36]Alright.
[337:55.06]That's pretty good.
[337:56.52]Pretty good day.
[338:02.51]Agreed.
[338:03.53]Agreed.
[338:04.01]Pepe hands.
[338:06.55]It got better.
[338:07.47]Omega LOL, you're welcome.
[338:17.25]My chat experience.
[338:18.83]Yeah, like, what the fuck is happening?
[338:20.75]Alright.
[338:21.57]We'll see you tomorrow.
[338:22.87]Take care of yourselves.
[338:24.13]I'm gonna tweak some audio stuff so people don't, like, fucking try to, like, murder me.
[338:29.20]For having a different microphone setup.
[338:30.90]People will be clawing at my door.
[338:35.04]Alright.
[338:35.48]We're gonna raid Joel.
[338:36.22]I wanna watch Jump King.
[338:37.62]Thanks for watching, guys.
[338:38.32]See you tomorrow.
[338:39.36]For Lord of the Rings.
[338:42.54]Let's do the bits.
[338:43.62]We're gonna raid Joel.
[338:44.70]If you wanna go watch Joel, he's already there doing it, but we're gonna do the bits.
[338:49.11]Thanks for watching, guys.
[338:51.45]Very cool.
[339:00.98]I need to exit the game.
[339:07.64]Yeah, so that concludes JeremyPlays, a game that came out in the last at least six months.
[339:13.14]Now let's go back to playing games that came out 15 years ago.
[339:15.58]Yeah, sounds about right.
[339:16.50]So I got my quota for game that released in a year, like within the last year.
[339:19.99]Alright.
[339:28.33]Was that new?
[339:28.97]Katana ZERO came out like this year, right?
[339:30.85]Last year?

[339:43.67]No, I'm not using comedy bits.
[339:47.86]Remember, what's the device that records your voice?
[339:49.84]A microphone.
[339:53.30]Hey, Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[339:55.30]Hype time.
[339:55.90]I'm giving Jeff Bezos money to bless this Katana ZERO stream hype pug champ.
[340:03.62]cougar stable thanks for the thousand bits have fun with Katana ZERO it's a great game it was good I did enjoy it I enjoyed my time a little short it was a little short but you know you it I just wanted more I wanted and maybe if the game was like if the game was like another hour or two long if it was like a five to six hour long game rather than like a four hour game you know I I'd be more happy about it you know I'm saying
[340:34.98]So.
[340:36.32]But, I guess it... What was it?
[340:38.11]It's a little short.

[340:44.85]That's alright.
[340:45.31]We'll watch him play Jump King and fail.
[340:46.77]And he has to win.
[340:48.49]What was my Jump King score?
[340:50.54]Keep it in mind when you watch Joel.
[340:52.80]The game was made by like four people.
[340:55.56]I mean, it's a great game.
[340:56.82]I just wish it was longer.
[340:58.50]I'm not saying game's bad because it's short.
[341:00.22]I'm just saying I wish game was longer because I liked game.
[341:04.25]Potion Dweller, thanks for the 250.
[341:05.97]Jeremiah, I must say, you need a little work on the mic adjustments.
[341:08.11]You sound, like, sick.
[341:09.67]You sound a little sick on it.
[341:12.87]We're gonna get a shitload of... We're gonna get a shitload of fuck-your-mic settings for it.
[341:20.22]It's coming.
[341:21.02]In these bits, I didn't know it.

[341:58.81]I don't know if I want to have that happen every single day.
[342:00.84]I
[342:02.09]If that turns on every day, it's like, hey, welcome to the stream, guys.
[342:06.91]Here's the hype train.
[342:08.21]Where's the 200 gifted subs?
[342:11.49]I think I'm, maybe I'll adjust it.
[342:12.89]I don't know.
[342:15.89]I don't want to put like pressure on people that have to level up the hype train.
[342:22.87]But let me see if I can do anything about it.
[342:27.46]Joel's chat is making you think you're raiding?
[342:28.96]I mean, not immediately, but I will in a minute.
[342:33.85]KajTech, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[342:36.48]Firebird, 500 bits.

[342:56.60]Jamie, again, 500 bits, hype bits for the hype train.
[342:59.80]If every day is a hype train, then the hype train loses its hype train value.
[343:06.99]Maybe I can go in and mess with the settings.
[343:13.01]You know, if you eat pizza every day, you're not going to want pizza.
[343:15.85]Well, that's not true.
[343:16.55]I would eat pizza every single day.
[343:18.07]Don't listen to anything I'm saying.
[343:21.51]Milhouse is a Pepe.

[343:42.03]It's not an- it's the same mic.
[343:44.89]It's a new audio interface.
[343:46.49]And we're not going back.
[343:48.31]Because this thing was very expensive.
[343:52.29]And I've- it took me like a few hours to set it up.
[343:54.56]The other one is going away.
[343:57.55]Uh, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna adjust it.
[344:02.57]Everybody's lost their damn mind.
[344:11.77]Now you control Discord calls.
[344:20.32]Oh, yay!
[344:22.74]Yes!
[344:24.76]Hey, now...
[344:26.22]God it'd be so funny if I did that in like a fucking funny somebody would go to somebody's Discord if I can do that
[344:58.79]I can't hear anything he's saying.
[345:01.11]Joel is not- well, let's find out.
[345:04.75]I'm gonna- I'm tweaking the settings.
[345:06.41]I'll fix it.
[345:07.65]I'm gonna get it to sound a little better.
[345:08.91]Oh, I mean, I don't know.
[345:09.71]We'll see.
[345:10.13]I'm gonna maybe- oh, just tweaks.
[345:11.49]You know, that's all it is.

[345:12.75]That's it.
[345:16.43]CrispyBacon, thanks for the 500 bits.

[345:30.89]Hope to see you at the Boomer Convention coming up this year now that I am one of your kind.
[345:34.01]You're 20.
[345:35.89]You are a baby.
[345:37.55]Give me a break.
[345:38.61]20?
[345:39.73]You can't even legally drink alcohol yet.
[345:42.25]What do you mean old?
[345:43.63]You're a baby.
[345:44.64]That's very young.
[345:49.62]You're so young and so full of energy.
[345:52.18]I'm happy.
[345:54.56]Thank you though.
[345:54.96]Happy birthday.
[345:57.25]We drank at 18, dumbass.
[345:59.56]Well, I don't know where you live.
[346:04.20]You're a piece of text on the internet.
[346:06.64]It doesn't say your country next to your name.
[346:15.23]Laughing in Jerma.
[346:17.93]Maybe it should.
[346:18.79]I don't...
[346:25.04]Research your viewers.
[346:26.30]How am I supposed to... Am I gonna put a census out?
[346:33.01]Flutters, thanks for the nine community subs.
[346:34.47]Appreciate it.
[346:35.03]Thank you, Flutters.
[346:38.11]We had 5,000 bits.
[346:40.51]$50 from Kajtek.

[346:50.81]Bulbaswag Desu, 1,500 bits.
[346:53.86]Thank you for the $15.
[346:54.58]How much do we need to donate for you to go back to your old mic?
[346:57.78]Nothing.
[346:59.62]No amount.
[347:00.82]Even if you gave $200 million, I wouldn't go back.
[347:05.92]Thank you for the 1,500 bits, though.
[347:07.01]Thank you, DoorCube, for the 1,500 bits, DoorCube.
[347:09.29]$15 from DoorCube.
[347:09.87]Appreciate it.
[347:19.48]Thank you.
[347:19.98]Happy birthday.
[347:49.01]Here's to 2020.

[347:59.05]2020.
[348:00.95]Happy fucking birthday, Dorku.
[348:06.28]Glad you've had some people that you can spend time with.
[348:10.72]We're social animals, for God's sakes.
[348:14.98]Why do you think I like to do this so much?
[348:17.68]I love talking.
[348:18.36]I love talking to people.
[348:19.25]I love talking to you guys.
[348:20.17]I love just being around people.
[348:22.89]With social animals.
[348:27.36]What an egomaniac.
[348:28.62]I'm saying no.
[348:29.47]Whatever.
[348:45.44]You turned up the compre- I didn't touch anything.
[348:48.07]The compression is at zero.
[348:50.07]The compression is now on.
[348:53.43]This is what it was at the beginning of the stream.
[348:57.53]This is what it sounded like.
[349:00.43]This is the settings for the stream.
[349:02.97]That was at zero.
[349:05.77]This is now compression.
[349:09.01]Yeah?
[349:10.67]This is without the compression.
[349:11.95]This is where we were.
[349:13.19]This is where the stream has been this whole time.
[349:15.61]Just right here.
[349:20.29]Here we are.
[349:26.43]The compression is bad.
[349:29.23]Well, ready?
[349:30.61]Listen to this.
[349:37.23]This is with literally zero.
[349:39.11]Everything.
[349:40.17]Zero, zero, zero, everything.
[349:41.25]Zero.
[349:44.15]Listen.
[349:46.21]This is what it used to sound like.
[349:53.31]There it is.
[349:56.39]It's perfect.
[350:03.03]It sounds the same.
[350:04.99]It probably does.
[350:08.53]Anyways, let's keep going.
[350:15.98]I still can't hear it.
[350:17.56]Go eat some food and drink some water.
[350:19.28]I drank water.
[350:19.82]What are you talking about?
[350:24.80]Cut your losses and type to us.
[350:30.26]Get a gate for the background noise.
[350:31.74]There's a gate on right now.
[350:35.03]As you can see.
[350:39.41]Hello.
[350:41.05]Yep.
[350:43.19]Yep.
[350:48.13]There is a gate.
[350:51.00]It's too aggressive.
[350:53.92]Well, I'll have to play with it.
[350:56.72]But, regardless.
[350:59.80]Let's continue.
[351:03.04]Read the comments of what?
[351:04.26]The black and white video?
[351:10.86]No, I don't care about this video.
[351:16.70]Here we go.
[351:18.88]Uh, but DoorCube, seriously, thanks a lot.
[351:22.04]I really appreciate it.
[351:25.60]Does it mean less rooms?
[351:26.97]It kind of does mean less rooms.
[351:31.77]Thank you, DoorCube, though.
[351:33.99]Seriously.
[351:34.55]I don't know what you did, but this is how I feel about your new audio.
[351:47.55]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[351:49.13]Okay.
[351:53.98]Whatever.
[351:54.82]Thank you.
[351:56.84]HiroTitan, thanks for the thousand bits.
[351:59.58]Go back, PepeHands.
[352:00.44]Old Jerma would have gone back to the old Mike.
[352:02.26]I don't even know how I could even explain this.
[352:08.47]You guys just don't understand.
[352:09.95]This is like, this is...
[352:16.54]I can't even... I'm not even going to address it anymore.
[352:24.56]What's this all about sound?
[352:25.72]I literally can't tell the difference.
[352:28.73]Um, well... What you're describing is... Maybe 100 people were annoyed that I changed my microphone setup, and then 4,000 just started trolling the stream.
[352:44.10]So, that's what happened.
[352:49.74]That's pretty much what happened.
[353:01.02]It was a dark day for JermaChat.
[353:10.52]It sounded bad at first, but we corrected it and it got a little better.
[353:14.68]It got better and it's gonna continue to get better as I figure out how all these settings.
[353:31.77]We are a proud people.
[353:32.99]Today was a success.
[353:35.95]Oh, okay.
[353:48.64]Thank you for the thousand bits, though.
[353:52.48]AV Joe, thanks for 5,000 bits.
[353:54.24]50 bucks from AV Joe.
[353:55.30]Glad to see you playing this game, Jeremiah.
[353:57.30]Thanks for the fucking huge amount of money.
[353:59.08]That's a ridiculous amount of money to give anybody.
[354:01.62]I just got it myself a bit ago, and I loved it.
[354:03.76]People keep telling you that you always help them through hard times.
[354:06.70]And I want you to know that from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate each and every stream you do.
[354:11.46]Even the Bugleberry ones.
[354:13.82]Really?
[354:16.72]Wait, even... Even Bugleberry?
[354:19.29]Oh.
[354:22.37]Oh.
[354:23.05]Oh, I can't believe it.
[354:26.01]Is it me?
[354:26.83]Oh, you're like me?
[354:27.73]Oh, thank you so much.
[354:29.01]Oh.
[354:29.07]No, I'm not going to do it.
[354:40.00]Get him out of here!
[354:40.98]Get Bugleberry out of here!
[354:42.14]Fuck that guy, he sucks!
[354:55.02]I hope Bugleberry has a fucking accident!
[354:58.48]Oh my god!
[355:00.42]What's wrong with you guys?
[355:04.57]Jesus Christ!
[355:08.00]Fatal accident!
[355:09.82]Okay, anyways.
[355:11.10]Jesus.
[355:14.02]You guys, we need to like get some vitamins in you guys.
[355:16.48]You guys have gone hollow today.
[355:19.46]Please don't ever think you don't deserve this or our love.
[355:22.04]You deserve all of it and more.
[355:23.16]P.S.
[355:24.59]Ask Etalyx to help with your mic problems.
[355:26.21]He always sounds real crisp.
[355:31.45]The thing about audio is... If you have a different audio setup than somebody, it takes a lot more.
[355:39.23]Joel quit Jump King, did he?
[355:52.62]Well, the thing is, Etalyx has a bunch of compression.
[355:57.90]The thing about that everyone said, they said they hated compression.
[356:00.89]Turn off the compressor.
[356:02.15]I hate compressor.
[356:03.31]I hate how you sound.
[356:04.19]Turn it off.
[356:06.87]What am I hearing right now?
[356:17.30]my hearing right now?
[356:31.89]What the fuck?

[357:30.70]And you're gonna see just how bad the mic was before.

[359:10.34]Let's see.
[359:12.99]Okay.
[359:14.01]Now, the only difference is there's not a in the background.
[359:20.45]That's the only difference.

[361:48.27]Topac, 250.
[361:48.67]Hey, I just came here to save the sound of your voice.
[361:50.45]You sound sick.
[361:51.07]But this is the exact same comment.
[361:55.71]Finny, thanks for the 250.
[361:57.03]What is Harbase?
[361:59.03]Well, here you go.
[362:05.85]Harbase School.
[362:07.10]Alright.
[362:07.56]Alright.
[362:20.87]You asked what hard bass was, like, four hours ago, I know.
[362:26.05]You didn't even get to the drop?
[362:29.40]Alright, nice.
[362:40.02]I don't like that that guy's microphone sounds!
[362:42.17]I don't like that that guy's microphone sounds!
[362:43.79]I don't like that that guy's microphone sounds!
[362:45.05]Maybe you should change your settings!
[362:50.36]Hey, Red Walrus, thanks for the... 700 bits.
[362:55.48]Dude, you just got corned so bad.
[362:57.20]It's the newest thing on Twitch.
[362:58.34]Laugh my ass off.
[362:59.41]Also, play Warhammer Space Marine.
[363:06.15]You got corned, man.
[363:07.61]Got him.
[363:08.21]With the corn.
[363:09.19]You got corned.
[363:11.73]Shadows1Disciple.
[363:14.00]Thanks for the 250.
[363:14.46]Hey, Jerma.
[363:15.06]Just wanted to say how thankful I am for your streams.
[363:16.64]They really help me relax after a hard winter day.
[363:20.65]Um, don't eat tahini paste.
[363:21.79]Put it on stuff.
[363:24.07]Put it in hummus.
[363:28.37]Don't put it on your sandwiches and eat it.
[363:30.23]It's bad advice.
[363:30.65]Very bad.
[363:30.83]Don't do that.
[363:31.32]Terrible advice.
[363:50.82]I don't do that.
[363:52.64]Eat a banana instead.
[363:55.62]Hey WhiteFox, thanks for 300 bits.
[364:02.57]I typically don't do politics at all.
[364:05.55]What does this have to do with politics?
[364:07.35]But recently I lost my job and so I've had a lot of time to sit around and read.
[364:11.53]Honestly, when I allow myself to step outside the happy entertainment bubble I enjoy from people like you and shows on Netflix, it's fucking horrifying.
[364:19.95]Oh, I see.
[364:20.41]Don't mean to be too heavy, but do you think it's better to stay ignorant of world politics or to stay up to date and think about things?
[364:26.52]I think, too, here's the thing.
[364:30.14]We live in a crazy fucking world.
[364:33.10]And you have to at least be somewhat informed of what's going on around you.
[364:39.87]But at the end of the day, everyone's got a life to live, you know what I mean?
[364:45.52]You got a life to live.
[364:50.36]It's a balance of both.
[364:51.60]Yeah, it is.
[364:56.02]You- you can be informed and you can be- you can have positions and you can stay up to date on world politics and- and your country's politics.
[365:04.48]But you also have to- you gotta do you.
[365:09.32]And there are a lot of things to care about.
[365:14.27]But you don't- it's- it's like my... It's like my- my gran- my mother and my grandmother used to say.
[365:21.57]If you keep the news on all the time, if you just have CNN on in the background, right?
[365:29.62]It's just you're constantly gonna get a barrage of things that you might not want to listen to.
[365:36.29]It's just a constant barrage of the things that are just... At some point, you almost get like desensitized to how all the noise
[365:46.35]And all the bad news and all the bad things that might be happening.
[365:49.61]And you have to, you do have to pay attention.
[365:56.12]But to an extent, and even on like social media, constantly seeing things that people have to say and what's your position on this?
[366:04.96]How do you feel about that?
[366:05.92]How do you feel about that?
[366:06.68]It's like, I've, I don't know.
[366:18.12]This thing is happening, this thing is happening, this thing's happening over here, and it's just like, fuck.
[366:25.17]And then you don't want to feel like you're not caring or that you're not paying attention.
[366:30.85]You know, because if you aren't informed on something that somebody asks you, and for me personally, if I don't know about a topic, really, if I don't know about something, I can't really... I'm not going to fight anybody over something.
[366:42.98]I'm not going to tell anybody something.
[366:44.10]I'm not going to tell somebody if I don't know.
[366:47.94]You know, if I'm not up to date.
[366:53.84]So I tend to steer away from political talk because for a lot of... I mean, I don't really...
[367:00.43]Involve myself too much in it.
[367:02.79]And I don't want to be one of those people that, when a topic of issue, like, I have my own personal beliefs, right?
[367:08.71]But I don't, I don't want to, I don't share them on stream.
[367:11.99]I don't put them on stream.
[367:13.10]I don't talk about them because this is, this place here, if you're talking strictly politics, you know, like, Republican, Democrat, how do you feel?
[367:24.30]Oh, Libertarian.
[367:25.52]Oh, I'm, uh, I'm not.
[367:27.52]I'm progressive, right?
[367:29.33]It
[367:31.28]This is not the place where I want to have those conversations.
[367:35.48]I want to hang out and have a good time, and play games, do video stuff.
[367:42.70]So, from my positions, I do have them.
[367:49.70]But this place right here, Jerma985, I don't engage on it.
[367:56.32]And I know there are some streamers that do, and people do, and if that's what they want to do, that's what they want to do.
[368:13.53]Fucking go out and vote this year.
[368:15.18]Jesus Christ.
[368:20.60]The thing is, like, politically, I don't, like... You guys probably already know all of my positions.
[368:26.47]I've talked about half of them already on stream.
[368:28.81]I got, like, shitfaced and talked about it before.
[368:33.45]You guys already know, like, all my... That's what I mean, like, I... And there's a lot of things that I don't know about, so I'm not gonna present things that... Oh, well, here's what I have to say about that, motherfucker!
[368:43.99]Uh, Jerma, that didn't even happen.
[368:46.13]What?
[368:47.13]What you're saying is not real.
[368:48.87]You have no idea what you're talking about.
[368:51.43]Oh, you're right.
[368:52.73]Oh, fuck.
[368:53.19]What do I do?
[368:55.39]Should I double down, or should I delete my fucking Twitch account?
[368:59.25]What do I do here?
[368:59.93]Okay, um...
[369:03.68]Let's go!
[369:07.82]Go all in!
[369:12.21]Backtracking Barry, yeah.
[369:16.51]Stay informed, but don't let it consume you.
[369:25.38]Hopefully that's pretty clear.
[369:36.48]Because politics can consume you.
[369:44.80]And you can't even have, like, discussions about anything or talk about anything.
[369:52.65]Something, you know what I mean?
[369:58.47]Don't let it consume you.
[369:59.43]Be informed, but don't be consumed.
[370:03.68]And there we go.
[370:04.46]That's my position.
[370:12.56]Alright, I voted for- In the la- in the last primary.
[370:17.88]Okay?
[370:18.76]I'm st- alright.
[370:29.71]Wait, hold on, wait a second, wait, hold on.
[370:31.65]Does this work?
[370:33.23]I voted for- Did it work?
[370:34.73]Is this supposed to go boop?
[370:36.65]Did it work?
[370:42.46]I voted for in the last goddamn Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, is it working?
[371:03.93]Why is it even on here?
[371:05.53]What's the point of that?
[371:06.75]It's its own button.
[371:10.17]This actually is... There's a swear button on here.
[371:14.65]Does that actually have to be its own button?
[371:16.53]I ain't ever gonna press that ever again.
[371:18.21]Clip this.
[371:19.07]Not pressing it ever again.
[371:25.19]Anyways, let's move on.
[371:28.01]Thank you, WhiteFox, for the 300 bits.
[371:29.97]Thank you, Gnarly, for the 250.
[371:31.07]Glad you ended up playing one of the two games I endlessly begged you to play.
[371:35.75]Yeah, a lot of people told me to play it.
[371:38.40]I'm happy you liked it.
[371:39.10]This is one of my favorite games of last year.
[371:40.72]Thanks for the stream, Jericho.
[371:42.44]Hey, thanks.
[371:47.06]Hey, Cougar Stable, thanks for the 400 bits.
[371:51.20]The final part of that... That final part of the club chapter was clean.
[371:54.77]You're doing great.
[371:55.37]Keep it up.
[371:57.11]And then they say, play AI.
[371:59.13]The Somnum Files.
[372:01.81]Oh, let me see what it sounds like.
[372:06.43]Wait, hold on.
[372:06.93]Wait a second.
[372:07.27]Wait, hold on.
[372:08.37]Does this work?
[372:09.97]I voted for... Did it work?
[372:11.61]Oh, it does work.
[372:12.79]Is this supposed to go... Did it work?
[372:19.21]I voted for... In the last goddamn... Oh, f***.
[372:27.31]Oh, f***.
[372:28.11]Oh, f***.
[372:28.95]Oh, f***.
[372:29.89]Oh, it actually cuts off the mic too.
[372:31.73]I didn't know that.
[372:34.43]That's pretty cool.
[372:35.53]It actually, it mutes the mic.
[372:37.81]I thought it was just doing it over the audio.
[372:39.51]Okay.
[372:41.53]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[372:43.57]Go XLR.
[372:44.23]Pretty good piece of equipment so far.
[372:47.07]Pretty cool.
[372:48.81]Just do that whenever you sneeze.
[372:53.99]Hey, Cougar is stable.
[372:55.01]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[372:55.89]Nice work on the psychiatrist.
[372:57.52]It was hard.
[372:58.26]I was starting to get really upset about that.
[372:59.64]It's okay.
[373:01.68]What happened to Turtles of Time?
[373:02.66]It's illegal.
[373:06.68]Acute pneumonia- Acute pneumo-snorlax.
[373:14.36]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[373:14.90]Let's hope a, uh, a donor comes through soon.
[373:35.56]Thank you so much for the 500 bits.
[373:40.68]And if you already have one lined up... Good.
[373:43.80]Very, very good.
[373:45.40]Get well soon.
[373:47.37]Much love to you.
[373:49.37]Thank you for being here.
[373:50.69]And thanks for the 500 bits.
[374:00.25]We're all pushing for you.
[374:01.13]We're all rooting for you.
[374:02.31]Anybody that's part of this fucking community...
[374:06.30]You got 10,000 of our percent, so seriously.
[374:11.32]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[374:20.39]We had HageGun for the 300 bits.
[374:21.89]If you like this, you can check out Deadbolt.
[374:23.55]Similar to the playstyle, also a really good soundtrack.
[374:27.17]Are we over 11k subs yet?
[374:28.59]We are not.
[374:31.31]But we are very, very close.
[374:36.30]We are very far... It's close.
[374:42.56]Don't forget to save your audio profile that you've made changes.
[374:45.96]Alright, yeah, okay.
[374:48.11]No memes aside.
[374:49.31]And no joking around.
[374:50.05]And no bait the guy to fucking have a meltdown on stream.
[374:55.57]How does this sound?
[374:58.11]For real.
[374:58.59]Like, give me it real.
[374:59.41]How does it sound?
[375:00.27]It sounds pretty good, right?
[375:00.97]It sounds okay.
[375:02.38]Good?
[375:02.80]Yeah?
[375:03.42]I mean, I don't know.
[375:04.86]Give me...
[375:05.88]Give me the real.
[375:07.72]You did sound fine.
[375:08.54]You sounded great.
[375:09.26]You sounded fine.
[375:12.28]Okay.
[375:18.11]Sounds like you were three feet behind me with a gun to my back.
[375:24.37]Okay.
[375:26.03]Alright.
[375:26.45]Alright.
[375:26.91]Okay.
[375:27.25]I'm just making you guys.
[375:28.61]It's hard to determine sometimes.
[375:29.89]Okay.
[375:34.73]cast the uh in the beginning of this stream it was like fucking crazy alright sometimes I don't even know what to think I'm like I'm trying I'm like okay we're gonna move on earlier it was worse than the basement mic stream what no way it can't be
[376:04.61]Man up with IcyHot.
[376:05.87]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[376:06.67]Thanks for the stream.
[376:07.19]Have a good night.
[376:07.67]You too.
[376:12.15]Halulu, thanks for the 250.
[376:13.47]Always love the retro game streams when you do them.
[376:16.08]I think you mentioned not wanting to do... I almost said Dragon Rampa.
[376:19.64]Dungeon Keeper once.
[376:21.18]And was wondering why.
[376:22.04]Always enjoy watching my favorite WoW reference streamer.
[376:25.32]Happy pizza times.
[376:26.14]Thank you, Halulu.
[376:29.92]I think the reason why I don't want to do Dungeon Keeper is because...
[376:34.77]It may be just a tad, it might be a little too slow for me playing it on stream.
[376:44.58]That game takes a lot to get going, doesn't it?
[376:47.98]If I remember correctly.
[376:55.61]Black and white wasn't, but yeah, but black, but I remember, I've never, I don't have very many memories of Dungeon Keeper.
[377:05.99]These idiots watched you play Nancy Drew.
[377:11.03]Yeah, uh, yeah, but we... Look, if you... But we can't hold Nancy Drew to the utmost lowest barometer.
[377:17.56]Because everything is more exciting than Nancy Drew.
[377:22.70]Everything.
[377:25.86]So, yeah, that's true.
[377:27.90]Dungeon Keeper is more exciting than Nancy Drew.
[377:32.01]But there's... Every game is.
[377:37.65]And the, and they, there was, the Drew crew was created.
[377:41.29]And now they, they will defend it to death.
[377:47.57]Right.
[377:47.75]So if they watch that, they'll watch anything.
[377:49.35]Yeah.
[377:49.77]Alright.
[377:50.09]We'll play Dungeon Keeper.
[377:50.97]Put it on the list.
[377:52.41]I have no defense.
[377:53.39]And that's the problem.
[377:54.29]When you do though, when you go all the way from, from like zero to a hundred, Nancy Drew is zero.
[377:59.67]And like, I don't know, like Sekiro is a fucking hundred, right?
[378:03.92]Everything in between is now on, on the table.
[378:08.50]Wait, hold on.
[378:08.94]You're not gonna play Number Munchers?
[378:11.24]You played Nancy Drew for two streams straight.
[378:14.04]Fuck.
[378:15.50]Fuck.
[378:15.94]You're right.
[378:16.33]You are... You're right.
[378:20.79]Dude, you think that, like, Hotline Miami 2 is too much for you?
[378:23.91]You did Sekiro on stream, dude.
[378:25.40]That game's ridiculous.
[378:26.90]Fuck.
[378:27.80]Okay, you're right.
[378:41.14]pretty much means any game that could be boring is on the table and any game that might be too hard for me is on the table cool alright do putt putt yeah that sounds good I already did I played all putt putts at the same time
[379:04.41]I am gonna toot my own horn here and say I'm terrible with spatial awareness.
[379:07.33]I'm really, really awful with complex systems.
[379:35.03]I don't do well under long-term pressure.
[379:42.92]But short-term Twitch skills, short-term, and I mean like less than a couple minutes, I'm pretty good at fast reflex-like patterns.
[380:05.69]It's... I'm okay with those.
[380:14.47]If I really, really, really wanted to, and I dumped tons of time into it, I would probably be one of those people that was able to potentially speedrun a game like this.
[380:27.87]I just don't have the attention span to do it.
[380:32.35]I just do not.
[380:37.05]I can't give it the time that it needs to do.
[380:42.98]Everything else, though, I'm... almost completely worthless.
[380:48.04]In a gaming skill sense.
[380:50.30]Sometimes I turn it on, but I know that I have... I know that I have some skill.
[380:55.40]You just don't have the patience for it.
[380:56.38]No, I don't.
[380:59.58]I really don't.
[381:04.00]Like, if I have to read a section of a book...
[381:06.47]to learn how to do a spell, and then I have to do something to cast the spell, and then I have to talk to three people on the way to the next quest.
[381:12.75]I'm gonna walk backwards off a cliff.
[381:15.63]Accidentally.
[381:16.50]That's just gonna happen.
[381:24.38]Has Jerma played a Touhou game yet?
[381:26.98]No.
[381:27.42]I actually was talking about this the other day though, not on stream.
[381:31.31]I think I would be really good at the bullet hell shit.
[381:33.81]I really do.
[381:38.66]There are a few classic bullet hell games that I think I would want to play.
[381:46.35]Ikaruga is on that list.
[381:48.93]And I know absolutely nothing about the Touhou games.
[381:53.26]But I know that they are the bullet hell games, right?
[382:05.91]But, anyways, I digress.
[382:09.89]Thank you, Hot Gamer.
[382:10.71]Hey, everyone's good at something.
[382:13.81]Everybody's good at something.
[382:17.51]It took me 20 hours to beat this game.
[382:19.71]But what about something else that you could do that I can't?
[382:23.48]Something you did very quickly.
[382:25.08]That could take me hours.
[382:28.28]Everybody's good at something.
[382:32.66]Just saying.
[382:40.89]Hey Green, thanks for the 500-bit screen.
[382:44.49]Thank you.
[383:06.70]Now, that blah blah was in the message.
[383:08.17]I wasn't doing that.
[383:09.65]Blah blah is in the message.
[383:13.11]Now, but seriously, uh, good luck in, um... Good luck going to high school.
[383:19.95]In September, when I was going through a lot of anxiety, transitioning to high school.
[383:25.02]High school's not as bad as you think it could be.
[383:30.10]Just get your work done.
[383:32.72]Don't take it too seriously.
[383:34.92]Respect your teachers.
[383:37.48]Because can we give it up for our teachers, please?
[383:39.56]Give it up for our teachers.
[383:43.11]They got a lot of... They're trying, you know?
[383:48.97]We gotta... We gotta... We gotta... We gotta treat our teachers better.
[383:53.67]I think.
[383:57.69]I think that the educational system... I think that... Education... Is one of the most important things in the world.
[384:08.74]Education is the most important thing in the world.
[384:10.54]I think that we need, you know, we need to make sure our teachers are prepared.
[384:23.69]What about water?
[384:24.57]We need water too.
[384:25.61]What?
[384:28.93]Teacher's pet.
[384:29.73]Teacher's pet.
[384:31.13]Shut up.
[384:32.73]Mebius.
[384:33.29]Thank you, Mebius, for the 500 bits.
[384:34.61]It's so dumb.
[384:37.65]That's the best comment of the night.
[384:41.84]Afron Gaming.
[384:42.38]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[384:43.48]They say Corgo.
[384:44.50]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[384:46.80]Snoozencopter.
[384:48.08]Thanks for 250.
[384:48.82]The politics thing intrigues me because I think about that.
[384:51.84]I'm not going to get political.
[384:52.84]I really am not.
[384:54.37]I'm not big into politics.
[384:56.09]My opinion, though, is that
[384:58.38]We all live together on Earth.
[385:00.14]It's important that we keep some responsibility that we can continue living here.
[385:03.32]Don't force stuff on others, but maybe support where support is needed, at least where you can.
[385:08.22]Getting your own life in order is support too, in a way, because you can raise generations that'll help each other more.
[385:16.16]That's a pretty... That's a pretty good take.
[385:20.36]It is.
[385:21.32]That's a pretty good take.
[385:26.79]That's a pretty good take.
[385:30.92]That's a pretty political thing to say.
[385:40.08]We only got one Earth, too.
[385:42.24]Only got one Earth.
[385:44.37]You are right.
[385:44.95]We got generations to come.
[385:48.29]We need to take care of our teachers.
[385:56.43]Just make another Earth forehead.
[385:58.96]That's what Elon Musk is trying to do, isn't he?
[386:01.20]Doesn't he want to colonize Mars?
[386:03.56]With his boat cars?
[386:04.42]That's a pretty good take, snoozing, though.
[386:13.08]Seriously.
[386:13.90]GooberryJuice, thanks for 250.
[386:15.16]Sorry I was such a shit chat member tonight.
[386:18.11]I'm incredibly tired and wasted after a full week of college course loads and parties.
[386:22.21]I only caught the end and I've been really pogging and burping at my monitor for the past half hour.
[386:29.01]Anyways, I'm gonna go throw up in my underwear.
[386:30.79]Thanks again.
[386:33.13]What is going on?
[386:34.77]PastaGlobs, thanks for 250.
[386:36.59]A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
[386:38.80]I can see where you guys started to get... Hey, Funzenberg.
[386:44.34]Thanks for the five community subs.
[386:46.62]Wendley, thanks for 250.
[386:47.86]Can I recommend you to play Star Wars Episode 3 after you play Lord of the Rings?
[386:50.86]It's pretty much the same sort of hack and slash game.
[386:54.97]They made Star Wars games like that?
[386:59.61]And then finally, Fitty.
[387:03.03]Thank you, Fitty.
[387:07.72]For the 350.
[387:09.40]Jerma, thank you so much for blah blah blah.
[387:11.42]I don't care.
[387:11.98]Next message.
[387:22.44]Good night, everybody.
[387:23.24]I'll see you tomorrow.
[387:24.52]We're going to do Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring.
[387:26.34]That stream might be like two hours long.
[387:28.78]I'm just going to be real.
[387:31.75]Let's go watch Joel Pepe laugh.
[387:36.49]Let's go Pepe laugh and watch Joel try to get through Jump King.
[387:49.84]See you guys tomorrow.
[387:52.65]Take care, have fun, and good night.
[387:58.57]Ta-ta.
