[01:01.40]Alright, so if you're not familiar how this works... I'm a magician, okay.
[01:05.54]If you're not familiar how this works, we time ourselves.
[01:08.51]It's going to be eight minutes this time.
[01:11.14]And we're going to try and build a horse in eight minutes in today's episode.
[01:14.80]And once eight minutes is up, we have to stop.
[01:17.24]Hands up in the air.
[01:18.26]We can't do anything else.
[01:19.16]So let's get this started.
[01:20.62]Are you guys ready to build a horse?
[01:22.78]We're ready.
[01:23.58]Yes.
[01:24.27]So on the count of three, eight minutes, three, two, one, go.
[01:33.07]Alright, hooves should be black, right?
[01:35.71]I'm gonna start with the feet.
[01:36.85]So the horse is gonna be brown?
[01:38.89]Yeah, the horse is gonna be brown.
[01:39.91]This is gonna be a huge freaking horse, man.
[01:42.13]That's a pretty big hoof.
[01:43.81]Alright, that is a big hoof.
[01:46.75]That's a big hoof, yeah.
[01:47.71]I'm trying to figure out, like, should we do this?
[01:51.55]He's going to have, like, skeletal legs.
[01:56.73]Wait, wait.
[01:58.19]The front two.
[01:59.35]Wait, should they be staggered like he's walking?
[02:01.47]Yeah.
[02:03.99]I think he should just be relaxing, maybe.
[02:06.25]All right, just like standing at attention.
[02:08.78]Reading the Sunday newspaper.
[02:12.04]Alright, I'm gonna... Are those too close together?
[02:14.24]I think they're okay.
[02:17.08]I think so.
[02:17.70]Dude, I'm waking... This leg is way too... This is gonna be a huge creation.
[02:28.08]We only have, like, seven minutes left.
[02:30.89]Go, go, go.
[02:32.29]No more dilly-dallying.
[02:34.07]Okay.
[02:36.72]Legs go straight up for a little while.
[02:38.34]Yours doesn't.
[02:39.38]No, it's okay.
[02:40.86]It's okay.
[02:41.24]He has a broken leg.
[02:42.20]Don't worry.
[02:43.52]What the crap is going on here?
[02:46.15]Okay.
[02:46.87]And now it's his body.
[02:48.33]Alright, so you close the body together.
[02:51.05]Oh my god, dude.
[02:54.15]Why is he the same?
[02:55.53]This is the derpiest horse I've ever seen.
[03:00.41]Hurry up.
[03:01.03]We don't have time.
[03:02.59]Mine doesn't have any knees.
[03:04.16]Just go.
[03:05.10]We don't have time for this.
[03:08.82]It's just going like straight up.
[03:11.08]It's gonna be like a stick figure horse.
[03:13.17]There's no time.
[03:13.93]We kind of just have to build it.
[03:20.15]Oh my god, why did we make the legs so big?
[03:22.12]We're never gonna finish this.

[03:31.14]This is gonna be an enormous horse.
[03:34.02]Alright, first of all, his body can't come out further than his legs.
[03:39.76]Oh god, that's why.
[03:41.24]He's so short.
[03:43.12]This is the shortest horse I've ever seen.
[03:44.88]Alright, two minutes and fifteen.
[03:47.34]This is like a wiener dog horse.
[03:52.80]We're making a dachshund!
[03:56.10]Alright, we can change animals, we can change animals, by the way.
[04:00.89]It's okay.
[04:01.51]Gotta stick to the guns, man.
[04:02.49]It's gotta be a horse.
[04:05.23]What's the deciding factor that makes it not a dog and not a horse?
[04:08.45]A long face.
[04:09.61]Actually, a dachshund has a long face, too.
[04:13.91]Well, that's not gonna work, then.
[04:15.84]Alright, no more messing around.
[04:17.04]No more messing around.
[04:18.74]We gotta get the body done.

[10:15.43]Alright, so.
[10:16.93]We're going to name him something, of course.
[10:19.41]Tradition.
[10:22.76]Okay, his mouth and his face looks like the grandpa, like, thumbnail face.
[10:27.24]I say we just call him Brokeback, because that's what he looks like to me.
[10:30.59]Brokeback.
[10:32.15]And, oh, and we have to, in the comments section, give him a name if you want.
[10:36.63]And, of course, give us a rating 1 out of 10, because that's the way we roll.
[10:43.28]So yeah, I guess that's gonna wrap it up, guys.

[10:49.76]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[10:50.68]Are we allowed to make modifications here to this guy?
[10:54.51]No modifications allowed.

[10:57.93]He needs a cowboy hat to go with... Yeah, but that's his chef's hat.
[11:05.93]What is with this guy's eyes, man?
[11:07.47]Seriously, that's like five different types of drugs in his bloodstream.
[11:11.80]Yeah, those are, like, when you go to get ice cream from the, like, guy who's driving around the, like, street, you get, like, a Bugs Bunny character, and he has those, like, oogly-googly yellow eye gumdrop things on the ice cream.
[11:23.33]You are absolutely correct.
[11:24.89]Wow, that's awesome.
[11:26.45]Alright, well, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
