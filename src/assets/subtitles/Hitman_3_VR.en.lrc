[00:03.71]Oh, everybody's expecting.
[00:05.73]Everybody's expecting me to do a big VR rant.
[00:10.19]Yeah, like I do every time.
[00:11.77]Everyone's expecting it.
[00:12.51]You're like, oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:13.79]Here it comes.
[00:14.21]Here it comes.
[00:14.71]Oh, here it is.
[00:16.07]Yeah, here it is.
[00:16.67]Here it comes.
[00:19.10]I'm not going to give it to you today.
[00:20.88]I'm just going to go.
[00:22.42]Let me tell you, though.
[00:24.32]Fuck.
[00:25.74]Never mind.
[00:26.10]I was going to say, fuck VR.
[00:29.68]Yesterday.
[00:30.38]All right.
[00:31.14]Everybody relax.
[00:32.50]Yesterday...
[00:34.72]I set everything up.
[00:36.67]Everything was ready to go.
[00:38.51]And this... Why does this continue to happen?
[00:40.71]I don't know.
[00:42.13]I set everything up.
[00:43.69]Everything's ready to go.
[00:44.93]It's a beautiful VR space with all this cool stuff.
[00:50.97]I get up this morning and I couldn't... You couldn't download Hitman 3 on Steam.
[00:58.19]They waited till the last second to even put a Steam store page up.
[01:02.92]So, like, don't get mad.
[01:06.16]So, literally, like, three hours ago, you could finally go to the Steam page for this game.
[01:12.41]And I got it.
[01:13.99]And I got it ready.
[01:15.71]And I open up the VR segment.
[01:18.41]And the shit is just mirrored.
[01:20.25]Just flipped.
[01:22.23]Everything is just mirrored.
[01:23.43]I was reading everything backwards.
[01:25.27]Everything worked fine.
[01:27.10]It's the only program I was using that was flipped horizontally.
[01:31.90]SteamVR was fine.
[01:34.18]My other games were fine.
[01:35.92]My headset's fine.
[01:37.84]Why was the game flipped horizontally?
[01:40.62]Dude, I've restarted the game like 15 to 20 times.
[01:45.29]And it's not flipped anymore.
[01:47.07]I... I don't... What happened?
[01:50.45]What the fuck happened?
[01:52.05]All right.
[01:53.15]I'm not going to go any further.
[01:53.91]I'm just going to tell you that HitmanVR is not good.
[01:58.73]I haven't played it yet.
[01:59.73]Everyone just relax for a minute.
[02:01.27]Let me just chill.
[02:06.13]Let me chill, he's gonna cry on stream.
[02:09.30]What's wrong with your voice?
[02:10.48]I'm like talking in a weird place.
[02:13.94]I'm using the VR headset mic like I did last time.
[02:18.56]So I'm talking in a weird place.
[02:20.08]Maybe I sound weird, I don't know.
[02:23.47]Seething.
[02:24.95]Yeah, I have that like seething voice.
[02:28.53]Do you guys know exactly what I'm talking about?
[02:31.17]I, like, you can tell by the sound of my voice, I'm, like, seething, my, the words trail off, like, it's a little more airy, you know what I mean?
[02:36.97]Like, that's exactly what it is.
[02:38.23]I've been sitting here for three hours, every, and this happens every time.
[02:44.08]VR is a $1,000 paperweight.
[02:47.70]I take that back, I don't mean that, I do.
[02:51.08]Anyways, I don't mean that, it's actually really fun.
[02:58.35]I'm fucking mad.
[03:00.59]I've been going back and forth with VR Josh, like, dude, what's going on?
[03:04.65]Why is my game flipped?
[03:05.73]He's like really trying to help me and stuff, but actually he had some good tips, so.
[03:10.88]Okay.
[03:12.00]VR is a piece of crap.
[03:13.68]I hate it.
[03:15.10]I can't wait to play Hitman VR.
[03:16.06]It's gonna be fun.
[03:17.94]Are you guys excited?
[03:20.10]Don't turn off.
[03:20.76]Please don't turn off.
[03:21.46]I don't know.
[03:22.32]It took me so long to get to this stage.
[03:23.60]Don't do the beep.
[03:24.72]Come on, please.
[03:26.91]Do not turn the fuck off.
[03:28.61]It took me forever.
[03:29.43]I had to download three different programs to get the chat window to show up.
[03:31.83]Just hit me in VR.
[03:33.07]Don't say it.
[03:33.45]Okay.
[03:37.63]I'm just drinking coffee.
[03:38.57]Just chilling out.
[03:39.21]We're just gonna chill out and drink some coffee, okay?
[03:41.19]Fine.
[03:51.70]We're gonna hang out.
[03:52.26]We're gonna chill.
[03:52.90]We're gonna drink some coffee.
[03:53.74]We're gonna hang out.
[03:54.28]Alright, everybody.
[03:58.72]Hitman VR flipped.
[04:01.30]It's not.
[04:09.35]Illusion again.
[04:09.97]The room's not big.
[04:16.76]It's a tall room.
[04:25.82]All right.
[04:26.84]Are you guys ready?
[04:29.07]Coffee's not good for you.
[04:32.07]Actually, there was a study that was done.
[04:35.79]Some medicine magazine.
[04:38.73]Coffee's actually good for your brain.
[04:42.56]It's actually good for your liver.
[04:44.52]No, no, no.
[04:45.34]Don't drink like the fucking extra cream, extra sugar bullshit.
[04:49.50]This is what I'm talking about.
[04:50.62]Don't dump it.
[04:55.66]Just a black coffee.
[04:56.38]Just black.
[05:03.56]That cup is huge.
[05:08.50]Pretty normal to me.
[05:10.48]I even got my ring light set up.
[05:12.80]Even more footage.
[05:17.15]Got the boomer brace on.
[05:18.15]I'm ready to go for like two to three hours.
[05:22.02]What brand coffee is that?
[05:23.20]Of course.
[05:24.50]German 985.
[05:26.15]Brinks Illy coffee.
[05:28.55]Only the best.
[05:34.33]All right, I hope I don't dump that on the ground.
[05:38.29]Nope.
[05:38.39]I'm going to get in.
[05:40.27]I believe the audio is on.
[05:43.14]I don't know.
[05:43.76]All right, what mission should I do?
[05:45.42]Because I have access to everything.
[05:49.28]What do you guys think?
[05:53.30]Make sure I get in this thing well.
[05:56.74]I see you.
[05:57.24]Hey, there you are.
[05:59.20]It works.
[06:00.97]Do the first level?
[06:06.63]The clown one.
[06:08.51]Dubai, Dubai.
[06:09.19]I mean, I have access to all of them.
[06:12.47]Also, can I do some scream tests to make sure that it's not going to hurt your guys' ears?
[06:16.94]Would you guys allow me to do that?
[06:24.54]Press A to play.
[06:27.64]Alright, dude.
[06:28.08]Press A to play.
[06:28.82]What's going on here?
[06:32.38]Can I do a few scream tests?
[06:36.14]Alright, what's going on?
[06:36.82]Don't even fucking tell me.
[06:37.61]It doesn't work.
[06:40.11]Oh shit, my fucking pants.
[06:41.09]It doesn't.
[06:41.43]It doesn't work.
[06:48.77]Can you hear it?
[06:53.66]Alright, I'm good.
[06:57.02]All right, let me put, I got to put the straps on and I'm ready to do VR.
[07:00.78]There's one.
[07:01.24]This is a little loud.
[07:03.64]I will say, at least for me, not for you.
[07:06.12]I'll make sure to turn you guys up and I'm going to turn me down.
[07:10.05]Welcome to hell.
[07:14.19]Welcome to streaming VR where four people need to be in the room for it to work out the way that you want it to.
[07:19.93]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going on another rant.
[07:23.33]Is that loud?
[07:24.43]How loud was that?
[07:30.29]Is it bad?
[07:33.37]What just happened?
[07:35.69]Your camera's tilted.
[07:36.65]Uh, I don't think it is.
[07:39.31]I think it's an optical illusion, dude.
[07:43.43]Because that's... No, my camera's not tilted.
[07:45.61]It's an optical illusion.
[07:47.97]Is it loud?
[07:52.53]Alright.
[07:53.32]I gotta get in this... I gotta get in this fucking game right now before I have a meltdown.
[08:00.40]I gotta turn the audio down for me.
[08:07.97]Better.
[08:09.47]All right, here we go.
[08:10.61]You guys ready?
[08:13.52]Here we go.
[08:13.94]Here we go.
[08:22.00]How's it look?
[08:25.04]Let's go, let's go.
[08:27.01]All right, Hitman VR.
[08:31.41]Hitman.
[08:32.75]Virtual reality.
[08:37.85]Where should I go?
[08:38.31]All right, so where am I going?
[08:39.75]What destination?
[08:40.65]What do you think?
[08:43.55]We can go to Miami?
[08:46.44]That's Hitman 2, right?
[08:48.74]I'm not doing the concrete level first.
[08:50.20]You're out of your mind.
[08:51.74]That is not happening.
[08:56.98]Concrete, concrete, concrete.
[09:00.17]Dubai.
[09:00.55]Alright, let's just do Miami.
[09:02.41]Because this is one of the first levels of the second game.
[09:04.73]I'm very curious how this is going to be.
[09:08.12]How is there hair in my nose?
[09:10.14]I just blew up to get the hair out of my nose.
[09:17.12]And I just fogged up the glasses.
[09:18.84]I don't want to scream because I think it's loud.
[09:22.15]Okay, spoiler alert.
[09:23.01]Doesn't matter.
[09:24.69]They're all fogged up now.
[09:26.91]Oh, fuck you, VR.
[09:28.03]Oh, fuck you, VR.
[09:31.49]Are you kidding me?
[09:33.09]I put that fucking gas up there.
[09:36.79]All right, I don't even care.
[09:39.69]I feel like in VR, it's like I'm getting fitted for a wedding dress.
[09:46.84]That's how many people need to be in this room to help me.
[09:49.52]I'm going like this.
[09:50.24]There's a person with a thing going around my neck and around my waistline.
[09:52.59]Does this look good?
[09:53.71]I need five people in here to help me.
[10:00.25]All right, difficulty.
[10:02.01]Not casual, right?
[10:03.87]Or should I do?
[10:04.45]I mean, it's VR.
[10:05.31]Isn't this gonna be like impossible?
[10:06.29]Let's find out.
[10:10.45]All right, here we go.
[10:13.53]Do I need to plan anything?
[10:14.25]I don't think so.
[10:18.02]Let's go.
[10:23.32]Please God, do casual.
[10:24.90]Well, it's a little too late now.
[10:29.91]My shit's all fogged up.
[10:34.75]Alright, make sure these are tight.
[10:47.20]We already know this shit.
[10:49.84]Nice t-shirt.
[10:50.58]Hey, thanks.
[10:53.80]We already know this.
[10:54.72]There's a driver.
[10:56.20]There's... Alright, okay.
[10:59.63]Okay, the finish line.
[11:00.81]This is actually- Okay, this is cool.
[11:07.98]Can I have a sip?
[11:08.98]Can I have a sip of that?
[11:12.64]I feel like- I feel like I'm playing- Remember when the Sims did their first person update?
[11:16.56]I feel like that's what I'm doing.
[11:18.10]What's wrong with my body?
[11:23.77]Can I get in trouble?
[11:26.45]Why is there a UFO?
[11:30.01]I didn't even punch him, I just like cocked my arm back.
[11:32.60]What?
[11:35.84]Listen to me.
[11:36.72]Okay, this is too real in VR.
[11:38.72]It's too real.
[11:40.34]I don't, I can't play it like it's too real.
[11:44.85]What's wrong with my hands?
[11:45.61]Why am I phasing out?
[11:48.95]How come nobody cares?
[11:51.55]Can I get in the picture?
[11:53.17]Where'd he go?
[11:57.11]I missed.
[12:01.93]I'm just a psycho.
[12:03.49]I'm sorry.
[12:04.43]No, I don't mean... I don't... All right, you can arrest me.
[12:08.54]I don't know.
[12:09.18]This is weird.
[12:09.82]Everybody looking at me.
[12:11.18]Don't look at me.
[12:13.49]Stop looking at me!
[12:16.50]Stop looking at me!
[12:17.66]I gotta get out of here!
[12:19.20]I gotta get- Oh my god!
[12:20.84]What do you want?
[12:21.96]What happened?
[12:22.96]What happened?
[12:25.36]What happened?
[12:26.28]What happened?
[12:26.86]What's going on?
[12:28.68]What happened?
[12:32.25]What happened?
[12:33.11]I punched a guy!
[12:34.01]I punched a guy!
[12:35.51]It was me!
[12:37.05]I punched a guy!
[12:37.79]This is fucking chaos!
[12:43.64]All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[12:47.39]What are you doing?
[12:54.75]Okay, that was too much.
[12:57.45]That was way too much.
[12:59.33]Wait, what?
[13:01.39]Replay.
[13:02.81]Restart.
[13:03.19]All right, restart.
[13:03.85]This is too much.
[13:06.12]We can't hear anything?
[13:07.96]Huh?
[13:08.92]I'll turn it up.
[13:10.88]I'll turn it up.
[13:11.40]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[13:14.90]Where's the audio?
[13:17.64]There it is.
[13:18.72]How's that?
[13:19.40]Alright, we're back.
[13:20.06]Is that better?
[13:22.10]Good.
[13:27.84]Now it's too loud?
[13:30.18]Your mic is peaking.
[13:31.20]I... I know, man.
[13:33.92]How bad is the mic peaking?
[13:34.98]Let me fix it.
[13:35.72]I got it.
[13:36.22]I got it.
[13:36.58]I got it.
[13:36.82]Check this out.
[13:37.94]Oh, shit.
[13:45.79]Let me test.
[13:47.48]That's better, okay.
[13:50.72]Are we in?
[13:51.56]We're in, right?
[13:52.00]Yep, okay.
[13:58.36]That was too much.
[13:59.06]That was like a little too much for me.
[14:03.78]All right, let's get in there.
[14:07.40]How is anybody reliably supposed to do this?
[14:09.28]Okay, don't be an idiot.
[14:15.42]Just be a tourist.
[14:16.64]That sounds easy.
[14:21.75]How do I take a picture?
[14:27.53]How do you take a picture?
[14:28.69]I'm just on drugs.
[14:30.15]Hey, man.
[14:31.07]Do you know how to work this thing, man?
[14:33.09]I don't know.
[14:33.77]Do you know how to work it?
[14:34.55]Man, there's no batteries in that thing.
[14:37.76]Oh, man.
[14:38.56]Sorry.
[14:46.13]Alright, so what do I got to do?
[14:48.09]Target's up there.
[14:50.76]Eliminate Cyr Knox.
[14:52.24]Eliminate Robert Knox.
[14:53.26]Alright, I know he's up there.
[14:55.74]And you're over there.
[14:59.28]Alright.
[14:59.88]Why do my arms keep doing this?
[15:04.50]Hello.
[15:04.98]I'll take that.
[15:07.14]What is that?
[15:10.43]View intel?
[15:11.13]What was it?
[15:14.01]How do I view intel?
[15:14.83]Can I have one of those?
[15:19.93]Oh, wait.
[15:20.69]I can... Hold on.
[15:23.77]Hold up on the left touchpad.
[15:28.52]Oh, shit.
[15:29.22]Okay.
[15:29.98]I was going to say, where's the map?
[15:32.62]Intel.
[15:33.20]Alright.
[15:33.48]Global Innovation.
[15:36.20]I can't even speak.
[15:37.84]Alright.
[15:38.02]Well, let's go.
[15:39.60]Am I going to get in trouble if I go through here?
[15:42.93]Do I have a gun?
[15:43.75]I don't think I have a weapon.
[15:47.15]Do I have a weapon?
[15:50.56]Thank you.
[15:51.12]Alright.
[15:52.18]You're welcome.
[15:52.52]There's so many people to load.
[15:59.30]Kill that guy.
[16:14.39]Where are you guys?
[16:17.35]Oh, there you are.
[16:18.56]Let me go... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:20.76]Excuse me.
[16:24.16]Okay, let's go.
[16:27.86]Don't hurt anybody.
[16:33.23]What?
[16:36.33]Free photo shoot?
[16:38.15]Oh, a soda!
[16:49.00]Why does your aluminum cans explode?
[16:51.62]You don't think that's a little dangerous?
[16:53.62]Why would an aluminum can explode?
[16:55.14]That's weird, right?
[16:56.10]All of us can agree that that's really fucking weird.
[16:58.98]Like, honestly.
[17:01.72]I guess nobody else thinks that that's odd.
[17:07.59]Oh!
[17:08.07]View intel.
[17:17.76]Get out of the way.
[17:18.74]Get out of the way.
[17:20.36]Move out of the way.
[17:22.68]Where's the intel?
[17:25.08]I feel like I'm just... When you have the other view, you can see what you're doing.
[17:29.11]I'm just lost at a convention.
[17:32.39]I hate this.
[17:34.45]I hate being, like, get away from me.
[17:36.03]What?
[17:36.25]Say, hold down the left pad.
[17:37.43]What did he say?
[17:37.97]Go to the viewing area and pretend to be one?
[17:39.21]This is making me sick.
[17:39.95]I mean, it is VR.
[18:00.37]I'll try to reduce my movements.
[18:01.57]Alright, can I just go down here?
[18:07.95]Oh, food.
[18:08.45]Alright.
[18:08.99]Can I get fries?
[18:15.44]Hey, you dare me?
[18:20.00]You dare me to do it?
[18:22.86]You need some ketchup?
[18:27.78]Everyone's looking at me like I'm a weirdo.
[18:30.15]I don't like being this close.
[18:31.53]Oh, parking garage is down here.
[18:34.85]Okay.
[18:35.23]Doesn't the guy come down here?
[18:36.79]Somebody comes down here.
[18:38.26]Alright, saving.
[18:39.56]POV, you're bald.
[18:39.98]Do the tutorial.
[18:40.70]I mean, I know how it works.
[18:59.84]There's a camera up there.
[19:02.08]Watch out.
[19:03.34]Okay, I gotta dress as this guy.
[19:08.72]Jesus!
[19:09.22]Whoa!
[19:09.62]Whoa!
[19:11.82]I'm just kidding.
[19:12.64]I'm just kidding with you.
[19:19.33]Whoa!
[19:22.21]Wait, come back here!
[19:36.24]YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING!
[19:45.91]What?
[19:46.65]Oh shit!
[20:01.70]It's like a monster!
[20:02.58]Oh my god!
[20:06.69]Security!
[20:07.63]You need to deal with this guy right away!
[20:11.94]I'm trying to strangle him!
[20:16.44]This is a restricted area.
[20:18.18]Nobody dicks with me!
[20:29.34]What happened to the antelope, whatever he was?
[20:31.58]How do I reload a gun?
[20:34.97]Yep, okay.
[20:36.33]Ooh!
[20:37.37]What?
[21:02.56]Where did the mascot go?
[21:05.04]Where's the mascot?
[21:09.98]I strangled him.
[21:14.78]What?
[21:15.36]Hold on.
[21:22.81]This is so... I don't like this.
[21:24.01]This is scary.
[21:25.15]Oh, my God.
[21:29.51]This is so fucked up.
[21:30.52]I don't...
[21:32.65]Oh my god!
[21:40.14]What happened?
[21:41.52]What happened?
[21:42.58]How do I reload this?
[21:46.38]How do I reload this gun?
[21:47.74]Alright, please.
[21:49.11]Nobody come in here.
[21:50.41]How do I stand up?
[21:54.65]Does anyone know how to... B?
[21:57.83]A?
[21:59.25]No, that's camera.
[22:01.87]How do I get up?
[22:08.65]How do I get up?
[22:11.57]C, right stick.
[22:14.15]Okay.
[22:15.31]All right, all right, all right.
[22:16.65]Where is he?
[22:20.51]The thing is, I don't even, there's no mini-map, so I don't know when the hell anybody's coming over here.
[22:24.97]This is hard mode.
[22:26.65]All right, I gotta stuff him in here.
[22:29.81]Oop.
[22:37.15]You know what I mean?
[22:37.73]There's no mini-map.
[22:44.81]It's alright, man.
[22:51.04]Okay, alright.
[22:52.92]We're good.
[22:54.44]I just gotta get the hell out of here.
[22:56.72]I don't want any weapons or anything on me, though.
[22:58.26]Right?
[22:59.10]No weapons.
[22:59.58]Don't take any weapons.
[23:03.64]Okay, now that I'm disguised...
[23:07.93]Okay, just leave it open.
[23:08.63]Who cares?
[23:12.03]What about all the bodies?
[23:13.85]I don't know, man.
[23:14.65]I'm going to have to leave them.
[23:21.40]What keeps happening to my arms?
[23:23.86]What's wrong with my body?
[23:31.10]What's... Oh, it's because I'm moving away from myself.
[23:37.28]Oh, this is weird.
[23:37.86]Why am I doing this?
[23:38.42]Okay.
[23:40.69]So now let's look at the Intel.
[23:47.57]Oh, okay.
[23:49.99]So I'm on this one right now.
[23:51.79]Key Intel was lost.
[23:54.29]Oh, nevermind.
[23:56.87]How about a perfect machine?
[23:59.83]That sounds good.
[24:03.39]So where is that Intel?
[24:07.35]They're up there.
[24:07.95]Alright, I'm going to go back up.
[24:09.85]I think I can actually go back up the whole way, right?
[24:17.85]Re-center your position with left stick.
[24:19.99]Oh, shit.
[24:20.33]Okay, nice.
[24:22.95]Alright, so now I'm the mascot.
[24:32.66]So now I can walk around freely.
[24:35.46]I don't even care if I get seen.
[24:38.11]All right, we're gonna go this way.
[24:45.67]What's this?
[24:46.65]Ooh, this is cool.
[24:56.74]Okay.
[24:58.94]Oh, I made it just in time for it to end?
[25:00.90]Oh, come on.
[25:03.79]Can you give me the spark notes?
[25:06.14]What did I miss?
[25:06.68]What year was that built?
[25:08.48]Come on, just what year was that thing built?
[25:09.68]Just tell me.
[25:10.79]Please?
[25:11.13]Okay, fine.
[25:31.96]It's like fighting.
[25:33.56]Alright, can I go in there?
[25:34.40]Oh!
[25:35.60]Intel!
[25:35.96]I don't have anything on me.
[25:39.41]I'm here for the meeting.
[25:41.25]How are we?
[26:00.99]Yep.
[26:04.83]I'm the mascot.
[26:05.45]I'm here to meet with the guy upstairs.
[26:06.67]Okay.
[26:08.51]That's alright.
[26:09.03]How do I give the finger?
[26:13.41]It's a VR game.
[26:28.19]Okay, over there.
[26:31.99]This is just a completely different game.
[26:36.17]It's a whole other experience.
[26:37.39]Didn't I say this sucks?
[26:40.32]I said this sucks, right?
[26:41.42]Like, before I even played it.
[26:53.86]I saved the game.
[26:58.32]How do I save the game?
[26:58.94]Tap up on the... There we go.
[26:59.86]Okay.
[27:00.22]Good.
[27:02.08]Oh, you don't understand.
[27:03.99]Oh, you don't understand.
[27:05.11]None of you understand.
[27:26.48]We can't let this stand.
[27:27.74]We can't let this stand.
[27:28.68]Are you kidding me?
[27:29.98]Robots like that?
[27:30.84]They're gonna... They're gonna take over.
[27:32.96]No, no.
[27:33.28]We can't let this stand!
[27:34.18]We can't let this stand!
[27:36.46]Ugh!
[27:36.62]Hey, don't worry.
[27:43.63]It's alright.
[27:44.11]It's attached.
[27:44.97]It's cemented.
[27:46.29]It's screwed in.
[27:48.09]I'm just the weird guy that everybody looks at every time I try to do a little routine here.
[27:53.69]Uh...
[27:55.53]Hey, hey, knock on wood, right?
[27:56.68]That they're not going to kill us all.
[28:05.15]It's a beautiful vehicle, that's for sure.
[28:07.23]I understood from the briefing earlier that we're just supposed to grab him if something happens to it.
[28:11.83]No poking around the engine.
[28:12.98]What?
[28:13.38]I can push people?
[28:14.14]The Knox is a genuine technical genius.
[28:16.16]This is the Arcade Speed Mark III project.
[28:18.70]This particular car is the first production unit and is identical to the Sierra Knox that's been racing these past two days.
[28:24.42]If anything goes awry, we'll see him down here as fast as Knox.
[28:27.97]Gotcha.
[28:28.45]47, the race is over.
[28:29.37]It's already tapping you?
[28:30.99]The Sierra will be coming off the track any time now.
[28:34.52]That's crazy.
[28:35.40]Yeah, that's weird.
[28:36.08]I'm just going around fucking tabbing people, dude.
[28:37.86]I'm just being a weirdo.
[28:38.78]Alright, where's my intel?
[28:39.31]I'm so distracted.
[28:40.13]I'm sorry.
[28:40.63]I just am.
[28:53.42]of the car effectively being run by an AI?
[28:56.46]Well, that's a bit of sci-fi storytelling made up by the press.
[29:01.02]It's completely... Imagine a guy dressed like this running up and doing like a power move, right?
[29:07.53]Like an inch away from your face.
[29:10.25]How am I still allowed in here?
[29:11.51]I'm clearly on like fucking crack.
[29:13.59]I'm afraid not.
[29:14.39]We've had a few incidents with people getting a little too handsy.
[29:17.02]All right, where's my... We've had to restrict access to the car.
[29:20.04]Did I lose the intel?
[29:21.72]Yes, of course.
[29:23.46]What was it?
[29:23.86]Okay.
[29:26.18]Oh, Robert Knox has a prototype of his RK Mark III racing car on display in the Kronstadt Bayside Center.
[29:33.12]He's so concerned about it that he has ordered the engineers in the expo building to get him.
[29:38.08]Immediately.
[29:39.05]Should anything happen to the car, it's likely he will come rushing down to fix it himself.
[29:44.35]Okay.
[29:44.97]We gotta fuck up the car.
[29:45.73]You got it.
[29:56.09]Get out of the way.
[29:56.47]I didn't want to talk to you.
[30:01.67]Okay.
[30:06.45]So, I got a mess with the car.
[30:08.37]Our engineers are working.
[30:09.39]Do not enter.
[30:09.95]What?
[30:11.91]Am I getting in trouble for this?
[30:15.48]Save it.
[30:22.34]He's gone?
[30:22.80]Hi.
[30:25.87]Hi, I'm back.
[30:28.77]Okay.
[30:32.18]What the fuck?
[30:34.94]What?
[30:35.40]What?
[30:36.18]What's wrong?
[30:37.04]Uh, sir, you are trespassing.
[30:39.60]Uh, no, I'm not.
[30:40.90]I mean, I'm just trying to get an Instagram video.
[30:43.46]I'm just trying to get an Instagram video for, like, my followers.
[30:46.91]I thought I could get a picture in there.
[30:49.83]What happened?
[30:50.71]Oh, I have to be an engineer.
[30:52.11]Sorry.
[30:52.47]Very good, sir.
[30:53.47]Just keep walking.
[31:00.14]Alright, we're good.
[31:02.22]I'm sorry, it's fine.
[31:07.66]Are you an engineer?
[31:09.96]Strangle him!
[31:10.72]I'm trying to strangle him!
[31:28.37]Hey, give me that gun, motherfucker!
[31:34.21]I covered my hands with butter before I came here!
[31:36.69]That's how you- You're never gonna get me!
[31:49.88]I was trying to- How do you choke people?
[31:53.11]I'm sitting there trying to choke the guy.
[31:54.49]I can't choke him.
[31:55.27]Why not?
[32:00.87]Your hands need to what?
[32:07.05]Can't you go over like this and strangle people?
[32:14.29]Your hands will enter choke.
[32:15.83]Oh, VR Josh tried to help me.
[32:18.25]You need to enter choke mode?
[32:19.51]Okay.
[32:27.40]So you're telling me if I put my hands around this guy's neck like this and I hold.
[32:42.94]Me smash, me caveman.
[32:45.48]Me don't understand technology.
[32:47.16]Technology don't know what is.
[32:50.57]Me don't know.
[32:53.05]Me don't know technology.
[32:57.71]Get up, stand up, stand up.
[33:06.48]Me don't understand technology.
[33:13.67]All right, reload, load, load, load, load, load, load, load.
[33:16.11]Load it, load it, load it, load it, load it, load it.
[33:21.99]What am I supposed to do about this?
[33:31.80]I have to go, okay, I gotta find an engineer.
[33:39.24]I feel like it's that guy, but how do I, wait, do I have any coins or anything?
[33:43.01]Do you have any coins?
[33:45.25]I don't.
[33:45.75]I need to find, like, okay, I gotta distract you, I gotta get you over there, and I'm gonna strangle you.
[33:56.14]Expo staff only.
[33:57.00]I am expo staff.
[33:58.34]Are you serious?
[33:58.86]I'm the guy in the big outfit.
[34:09.09]What's this?
[34:09.87]Ooh, coins.
[34:12.63]No, put it away.
[34:18.03]What is this?
[34:18.55]Oh, it's a soda.
[34:22.21]Okay.
[34:27.48]Okay.
[34:27.68]Alright.
[34:28.00]Alright.
[34:28.28]Now I can distract him.
[34:38.54]Alright.
[34:38.76]Save the game here.
[34:41.27]What?
[34:41.59]Whoa.
[34:41.98]Hey.
[34:43.52]I'm just looking.
[34:44.34]I thought that was the bathroom.
[34:45.36]Sorry.
[34:46.80]I thought that was the bathroom.
[34:50.52]All right.
[34:50.76]Save the game here.
[34:51.22]I'm going to save the game, you dummy.
[35:02.53]Okay.
[35:02.73]Here we go.
[35:05.37]Look at me.
[35:06.55]To choke somebody, it's going so fast, I can't read it.
[35:09.31]Please soil the car.
[35:11.17]Your hands will flex before you, when you, okay.
[35:13.33]I think I got it.
[35:13.81]Hmm.
[35:24.80]Okay.
[35:27.00]That's not what I wanted to do.
[35:33.68]I didn't want to do that.
[35:36.84]You can keep that one.
[35:40.12]How do I throw this?
[35:43.58]What the fuck?
[35:44.52]How do I throw things?
[35:46.78]This is pissing me off.
[35:50.34]Oh, wait.
[35:51.51]I remember.
[35:51.87]All right, leave me alone, please.
[35:55.59]Leave me alone, please.
[35:59.91]Damn.
[36:03.05]Look what's happened over there, man.
[36:04.23]Something happened.
[36:04.91]Go see what that was.
[36:17.01]What?
[36:17.25]Where am I?
[36:18.99]It's too dark.
[36:19.53]It's so dark in here.
[36:20.47]All right.
[36:22.27]It was so fucking dark in there.
[36:23.51]I didn't even know where I was.
[36:25.35]I get it now.
[36:25.71]I get it.
[36:25.97]I get it.
[36:26.15]I get it.
[36:26.37]So you're telling me that my hands are going to do a choking motion.
[36:34.00]So when I put... Oh, I can just punch him.
[36:37.52]That's right.
[36:37.82]What am I thinking?
[36:38.32]All right.
[36:40.42]Can you guys see me?
[36:43.21]I have so much room over here.
[36:44.65]I've got to utilize it.
[36:46.40]Okay.
[36:47.60]So, give me the coin.
[36:50.86]What the hell is this?
[36:53.38]Where are my coins?
[36:56.13]Where are my coins?
[36:57.45]I just had them.
[36:58.03]What happened?
[36:58.43]What the fuck?
[36:59.51]Where are my coins?
[37:03.15]Okay.
[37:14.72]Why do they look weird?
[37:15.74]What's going on here?
[37:16.30]I mean, look, they're right here.
[37:17.76]Select.
[37:18.02]RG.
[37:18.08]What the hell?
[37:18.54]Okay.
[37:18.72]Fuck you.
[37:19.04]Wait.
[37:19.24]This is so hard to... Don't look at me.
[37:49.28]I think you dropped this.
[37:52.56]I think you dropped this.
[37:53.60]All right, get out of the way.
[37:55.90]Oh.
[37:56.70]What?
[38:04.45]Okay.
[38:07.93]Uh-huh.
[38:19.16]Did I break something?
[38:19.82]Did I break something?
[38:20.70]I think I might have broken something.
[38:37.85]Don't move!
[38:38.93]You can't be here!
[38:39.85]You're not getting away with this!
[38:45.83]This is so hard in VR.
[38:46.83]I have no map.
[38:47.47]Alright, I'm gonna leave.
[38:48.41]I'm gonna... Forget this guy.
[38:49.55]Forget that guy.
[39:15.13]Yeah, I know.
[39:15.45]So you hold left trigger, you make a throwing motion, and then you let go, right?
[39:21.28]That's what the tutorial said.
[39:23.92]I did the tutorial.
[39:29.52]That guy.
[39:34.16]So I need to mess with this car.
[39:35.46]I need, like, an engineer outfit.
[39:38.36]Was that weird? ...
[39:45.06]Play the tutorial.
[39:47.06]You don't actually throw it.
[39:49.26]Okay.
[39:50.17]I'm getting out of here.
[39:51.03]I'm getting out of here.
[39:52.15]The exhibit sucks.
[39:52.99]It's not even worth it.
[39:55.83]Yeah.
[39:56.15]We all paid $50 on Groupon to fucking come here.
[39:59.47]Look at that.
[40:00.24]That's all that's in here.
[40:02.36]They make you watch a two and a half hour video in the next room.
[40:04.92]$50, by the way.
[40:13.77]All right, where do I go?
[40:14.89]I thought that was a person, nevermind.
[40:18.25]I was like, there's an engineer!
[40:20.89]Who uses Groupon?
[40:23.57]I don't know, I don't think very many people.
[40:28.70]First of all, okay, I like this.
[40:32.56]Okay.
[40:34.98]I can sneak in here.
[40:39.78]This definitely, okay, let me look at the map.
[40:42.57]Because, like, holy shit, this is hard without the map.
[40:45.67]Okay.
[40:46.59]The aquarium's right here.
[40:49.07]I'm gonna go through the aquarium.
[40:50.27]Let's see if it helps.
[40:53.56]I gotta get this stupid bird costume off.
[40:55.22]I look like an idiot.
[40:55.92]And I can't- I'm not even allowed here.
[41:03.68]And of course, right?
[41:05.37]Of course.
[41:07.41]The cool thing with the fish-
[41:09.66]This whole area is unbelievable.
[41:11.28]Look at all this knowledge, look at all this- all these cool facts about fishes and shit.
[41:15.36]Nobody's in here.
[41:16.68]This was probably 10 bucks.
[41:20.24]Of course, right?
[41:21.70]No, let's go see the robots.
[41:22.64]They're gonna fucking kill us all and stuff.
[41:23.91]No, not the fish though.
[41:25.77]Cool.
[41:25.95]Where's my shit?
[41:42.41]Reminds me.
[41:43.33]You want to come over for Clara's birthday?
[41:45.51]She'll be six.
[41:46.93]You don't have to answer now.
[41:48.57]Let's just keep walking.
[41:51.16]I'm too tired right now.
[41:54.50]That didn't work.
[42:11.55]You can't see me, there's no way!
[42:13.19]Alright, I went into the wall, they can't see me.
[42:17.85]What?
[42:18.71]It's a fucking aquarium, bro!
[42:21.21]What do you mean restricted area?
[42:23.13]Alright, okay, sorry.
[42:24.71]Sorry, I went into the aquarium.
[42:26.87]Yeah, okay.
[42:27.75]Yeah, I'm in trouble, aren't I?
[42:29.53]I'm leaving right now.
[42:34.74]What the f- I'm fucking leaving right now!
[42:36.99]I'm sorry, my body is fucked up.
[42:39.25]I'm leaving right now.
[42:41.01]Okay.
[42:41.15]This fucking game!
[42:42.45]Come here!
[42:42.81]Come here!
[42:43.69]I don't wanna put- put the gun down.
[43:08.42]Where's the other guard?
[43:14.57]Where's the other guard?
[43:20.19]I gotta go kill the other guard.
[43:21.13]I have to, like, knock him out.
[43:21.83]Alright, get up, get up, get up.
[43:28.57]Where is he?
[43:28.81]There he is.
[43:37.61]What?
[43:37.89]No!
[43:38.19]You can see through my disguise!
[43:39.47]We're good.
[43:49.86]Okay, I got a gun.
[43:52.10]Where's my gun?
[43:59.02]Put that away.
[44:03.11]Let me re-center.
[44:05.42]Alright, now I have... I gotta save the game.
[44:07.23]Right now, this is bad.
[44:07.89]If I don't... Now I can actually probably go over there and sit down, right?
[44:16.41]Put that guy in the tank.
[44:18.17]What do you mean, put him in the tank?
[44:27.88]What do you mean, put him in the tank?
[44:38.29]What?
[44:40.95]Why did it go black?
[44:46.26]I gotta do it to the other guy too, I think.
[44:54.73]It was too scary.
[44:57.83]There's a minimap in settings.
[44:58.85]It will appear... What?
[45:01.05]Is it really?
[45:01.39]There's a minimap in the settings?
[45:10.07]Yeah, yeah, there's something on your shirt.
[45:12.59]Minimap and settings, really?
[45:15.05]Where is it?
[45:21.01]Wrong settings, go back.
[45:27.60]Okay, where?
[45:29.42]Gameplay, HUD.

[46:10.46]VR blinders.
[46:12.24]Toggle the blinders on.
[46:14.03]VR turn mode.
[46:15.75]Head bob.
[46:17.01]Collision.
[46:20.85]Guys, it's so much more different when you're in the headset.
[46:23.51]Like, I'm looking at a gigantic mural in front of me.
[46:26.67]Minimap!
[46:27.09]Alright, there it is.
[46:28.21]Minimap VR.
[46:28.87]Holy shit, thank god.
[46:31.86]Where is it?
[46:35.78]Alright.
[46:36.38]That kind of blocks you guys, though.
[46:40.57]This is not as good as I thought that was gonna be.
[46:42.25]Okay.
[46:43.13]Alright, well, whatever.
[46:43.67]Let's go.
[46:46.47]You bet your ass I'm gonna fucking take a hammer.
[46:48.01]Are you kidding me?
[46:54.06]Alright.
[46:55.10]I now have- I'm a security guard.
[47:00.40]Not bad.
[47:03.84]Okay.
[47:04.54]I'm gonna go back in here.
[47:06.48]I'm technically an employee now, right?
[47:11.33]I just turned around.
[47:16.59]This way.
[47:17.09]So now I should be able to go back behind there, throw a coin, snap the guy's neck.
[47:26.56]Yeah, okay.
[47:27.06]I got it.
[47:28.72]Dump the body.
[47:30.00]I don't need to dump the body.
[47:30.73]I'm fine.
[47:36.39]I'm coming for you.
[47:39.74]Okay, so if I sit in it now, what happens?
[47:44.48]Can I sit in the car as a security guard?
[47:48.57]Are they gonna get mad?
[47:55.75]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[47:57.51]Oh my god, really?
[47:59.23]We can't just have a little bit of fun?
[48:02.96]Why?
[48:04.22]We can't just have a small amount of fun?
[48:06.62]We're like guarding this thing.
[48:07.92]Well, I'm not gonna break anything.
[48:13.95]There's more than one engineer.
[48:18.43]But it's so hard to find them.
[48:20.01]I don't know.
[48:20.56]I gotta look for this name tag?
[48:21.68]Can I see what that looks like?
[48:26.38]Okay, I gotta find a Kronstadt engineer.
[48:29.86]But they could be anywhere.
[48:30.74]This is the worst game of the year?
[48:41.74]I don't think so.
[48:44.53]Alright, I can go in here.
[48:45.49]This is employees only.
[48:46.35]Let me in here.
[48:50.65]I'm just a guy like you.
[48:53.29]What's in here?
[48:54.77]Engineer?
[48:55.15]Engineer?
[49:12.42]I'm hitting this guy with a fucking hammer.
[49:19.11]What's this guy made out of?
[49:20.55]WHAT?!
[49:25.87]You can't be serious.
[49:26.79]You can't be serious.
[49:28.51]Hit the guy 10 times with a hammer.
[49:30.07]I hit the guy 10 times with a hammer.
[49:32.19]You understand?
[49:32.51]That wasn't my fist.
[49:33.21]I punch a guy in the face once and he goes down.
[49:34.78]I hit him in the head with a hammer 15 times and he's not gonna go down?
[49:41.42]Hold the trigger when you bash.
[49:46.96]Did you guys hear that?
[49:54.86]This game was not made for VR.
[49:57.92]No, but it's kind of fun to do it anyways.
[50:02.52]Alright, get me out of here.
[50:05.82]Oh, wait.
[50:06.40]We didn't dump him.
[50:17.52]It does... Oh, that's unfortunate.
[50:20.76]It gets rid of the whole cutscene.
[50:21.72]Okay, I am now... Go get the hammer.
[50:29.04]There's the hammer.
[50:30.04]So you're saying hold the trigger when I hit.
[50:36.82]That's what you want me to do?
[50:43.00]I'm just testing to see if it hurts me.
[50:46.70]Okay, I got it.
[50:47.68]Alright, can I not fuck this up a third time, please?
[50:59.91]Your back diaper looks full.
[51:01.43]That's again, I've been told not to say diaper and I just did.
[51:05.36]It's because I have a lot of pressure right here.
[51:07.32]All right, that's enough out of you.
[51:08.73]Let's try this again.
[51:31.99]Okay, that was- that was a little better.
[51:34.15]I gotta get rid of you.
[51:42.43]In here.
[51:47.90]Okay.
[51:49.30]You're in there.
[51:49.84]Good to go.
[51:53.98]What direction am I facing in the room?
[52:03.29]Okay.
[52:06.15]What's that?
[52:07.55]Screwdriver.
[52:20.82]Oh, shit.
[52:23.10]Can I get up there?
[52:23.70]Wait.
[52:30.52]There's no engineers back here.
[52:32.04]Why would there not be an engineer?
[52:33.24]Oh, no!
[52:35.36]I want camera!
[52:38.13]Engineer.
[52:38.57]Come on.
[52:38.79]There's all kinds of wires and shit back here.
[52:43.71]Look at all the wires.
[52:44.45]There's so much stuff back here.
[52:45.35]There's so much engineer stuff back here.
[52:49.21]Is anybody here?
[52:50.50]Somebody right here.
[52:59.79]That's an engineer right there.
[53:00.71]Engineer, engineer, engineer, get up.
[53:13.93]Jesus, I need help.
[53:16.25]Someone please help me.
[53:17.73]I hit him in the head with a, he's alive?
[53:24.24]Come on, like a little gremlin, get over here.
[53:33.02]HEY!
[53:34.42]Okay, alright, it's not what it looks like, man.
[53:36.03]It ain't what it looks like.
[53:37.25]It's not what it looks like.
[53:38.61]It's not what it looks like.
[53:39.73]Why is he still on me?
[53:41.59]It's not what it looks like.
[53:44.52]You fucking piece of SHIT!
[54:03.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[54:19.11]Wait, you don't wanna... Oh, Jesus!
[54:25.39]You gotta help me now!
[54:26.79]This is really bad!
[54:28.92]Hey!
[54:29.62]I didn't... I forgot that's where everybody was.
[54:33.08]I didn't do anything.
[54:36.10]I didn't do anything.
[54:36.70]We're fine.
[54:37.68]Everything's fine.
[54:38.54]Nothing... No problem at all.
[54:40.75]No problem.
[54:41.35]We can relax.
[54:42.97]I'm an engineer.
[54:43.73]Just like everybody else here, right?
[54:47.79]I'm not compromised.
[54:48.95]I don't think so.
[55:05.27]Are we good?
[55:10.43]We're good.
[55:11.85]No cops, right?
[55:13.67]I don't think so.
[55:19.94]I think I'm good.
[55:21.76]Alright, alright, alright.
[55:22.62]Here we go.
[55:27.41]I'm an engineer.
[55:30.33]I'm allowed in here.
[55:40.39]What am I doing here?
[55:49.85]Uh... What do I do?
[55:57.91]Click the switches?
[56:00.83]Smash it.
[56:03.86]You need to what?
[56:06.30]Go back.
[56:06.68]Back out.
[56:08.12]Back at the... Oh, okay, okay.
[56:09.18]Right here.
[56:12.55]Saboteur.
[56:14.77]Where's the screwdriver?
[56:17.85]I threw it in that guy's head back here.
[56:19.51]I don't know.
[56:19.85]I think it's in his head.
[56:21.47]Can I get it out of his head?
[56:29.78]It's like right here.
[56:30.96]Hold on.
[56:31.14]What's this?
[56:33.40]Oh, shit.
[56:33.86]Alright.
[56:34.27]It's right here somewhere, right?
[56:38.29]Screwdriver?
[56:38.81]There it is.
[56:43.44]Okay.
[56:43.68]Alright, we're good.
[56:49.66]I got a screwdriver now.
[56:55.44]Oh, fuck.
[56:56.40]What's wrong with that guy?
[57:00.20]Wait, that guy can see through?
[57:04.04]Alright, here we go.
[57:12.33]Now what?
[57:15.44]Oh.
[57:16.63]Okay.
[57:27.40]Now what?
[57:28.86]Oh, fuck you!
[57:30.40]What's connected to me?
[57:36.43]What happened?
[57:42.56]Where's this person?
[57:43.32]Alright, fine.
[57:44.81]Get over here.
[57:45.25]I'm gonna kill this guy right now.
[58:13.87]Oh my fucking- Jesus Christ.
[58:15.85]Jesus Christ!
[58:19.73]Oh.
[58:20.11]My.
[58:20.89]God.
[58:21.33]I- This is impossible in VR!
[58:28.38]My body's going like- Like, that's all that's happening!
[58:36.09]That's the whole game!
[58:41.70]Like, why am I detached from my body?
[58:49.47]I don't think you're supposed to stand up and play this.
[58:53.19]Like, for any reason.
[58:54.68]This is not a room scale game.
[58:59.04]Was that a, wait, was that a bad guy?
[59:17.09]out of this fucking place this is a standing only game yeah but I mean if you even if you're standing only it's like you're gonna move oh jesus oh I'm supposed to go like this
[59:47.49]Am I hunted right now?
[59:56.66]I am.
[59:56.82]Come here.
[59:57.58]This guy's got a fucking machine gun!
[60:23.69]Hold on.
[60:24.05]Stay there.
[60:24.49]Time out.
[60:25.27]Time out for a sec.
[60:30.69]I feel like I'm on my first day of paintball.
[60:33.48]Did he say LMAO?
[60:35.12]What did he say?
[60:51.57]Okay.
[60:52.39]I'm going to go back because this is not happening.
[60:56.02]I got to go back to when I first sabotaged the car.
[61:03.76]Put it on casual difficulty.
[61:06.68]That's probably a good idea.
[61:08.14]Can I change it right here?
[61:16.48]Peter Griffin.
[61:21.06]You don't need to be an engineer to get the screwdriver and sabotage it.
[61:23.74]Really?
[61:25.28]What the hell?
[61:26.14]I thought I had to be an engineer to do that.
[61:31.36]You should try aiming.
[61:33.82]I mean, I'll tell you, it's kind of, it's difficult to aim when your hands inside the palms are wet.
[61:41.59]All right.
[61:45.35]Do I have the screwdriver?
[61:51.97]Where was that screwdriver?
[61:53.05]It was over here, wasn't it, somewhere?
[61:55.41]You should wear gloves.
[62:06.33]You should sit down.
[62:06.87]I can't sit down.
[62:07.41]I'll throw up.
[62:09.25]If I sit down and play VR, I will throw up in 10 minutes.
[62:13.11]I have to stand.
[62:14.05]If I don't move around in VR, guaranteed I'm going to get banned from Twitch because I'll puke.
[62:19.94]It'll take less than five minutes.
[62:25.93]Do you have a shit stain?
[62:27.77]Don't say that.
[62:30.40]Don't say that, dude.
[62:31.36]Come on.
[62:34.12]Hey, remember this funny thing with this guy?
[62:35.52]I remember this guy.
[62:38.72]Oh, never mind.
[62:39.24]Alright, let me practice this.
[62:40.84]Because somebody... What?
[62:45.30]What happened?
[62:48.82]Okay, so when my hands do that, like, curl... Like...
[63:02.01]Slow down, buddy.
[63:04.48]OK.
[63:06.20]You, who are you?
[63:07.72]Why are they not doing it?
[63:12.22]You are.
[63:14.56]I don't understand if he wouldn't do it.
[63:27.46]OK, screwdrivers right here somewhere.
[63:34.59]Don't do the concrete level.
[63:37.37]I'm not gonna... No.
[63:38.29]I'm gonna do the... I'm only gonna do, like, five levels.
[63:45.67]This don't fit.
[63:46.36]Okay, whatever.
[63:46.92]Fuck it.
[63:48.62]Okay.
[63:49.34]So now you're telling me just go and sabotage it?
[63:52.54]Don't worry about anything else?
[63:53.46]Don't hurt anybody?
[63:54.08]Don't punch anybody?
[63:54.74]Don't kill anybody?
[63:56.12]Don't do anything dumb?
[63:57.70]Just sabotage.
[63:59.52]I'm gonna save it right here.
[64:07.81]You should do something dumb.
[64:09.87]I feel like that's been the last, like, 45 straight minutes.
[64:20.28]I know.
[64:20.68]I feel the same way.
[64:21.86]Everything's sticking to me right now, too.
[64:23.50]Okay.
[64:23.82]So.
[64:24.06]Sabotage the engine.
[64:39.20]now be a security guard until he shows up huh why's the engine off let's just try to get this started again well that doesn't sound good better call nox
[65:04.33]Why am I sitting here like, ooh, I didn't do anything bad, I'm so peaceful!
[65:07.51]Alright, so here he comes.
[65:08.96]Now what?
[65:09.14]Oops.
[65:09.32]You're not done sabotaging it?
[65:11.44]How?
[65:32.98]Save the game.
[65:33.54]Can you not be the sus guy?
[65:35.10]That's too late.
[65:41.20]You need to find the car blueprints.
[65:44.02]Go back.
[65:47.11]Wait, I'm going to read the intel.
[65:49.41]I've never done this mission before.
[65:51.83]Okay, this is it right here.
[65:53.81]Yeah.
[65:56.79]Okay, so if anything happens to the car, he will come rushing down to fix it himself.
[66:01.07]So do I have to put like a bomb or something there?
[66:03.29]Can I find the car blueprints near the tarp?
[66:09.36]You need the blueprints.
[66:13.02]Yes, you have.
[66:17.42]Your shirt.
[66:19.30]Is that him?
[66:20.04]Who is that?
[66:21.93]What?
[66:22.31]Whoa.
[66:22.91]What the fuck?
[66:23.69]I'm a security guard.
[66:25.15]I'm a security.
[66:25.65]You bumped into me.
[66:27.45]I need you to get in the car.
[66:28.73]Don't touch anything until I tell you.
[66:33.31]Is that me?
[66:33.73]Do you want me to get... Sir, do you want me to get in the car?
[66:37.75]Do you want me to get in the car?
[66:40.93]He's gonna strangle him!
[66:49.91]Get down, get down, get down!
[66:56.88]Oh my god.
[66:57.68]The save... That game doesn't auto-save.
[66:59.44]I forgot.
[67:01.52]It's alright, I'm a raider.
[67:03.12]So I'm not, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:04.60]So I need to get like, somebody said I need to get like something to put it, to sabotage it.
[67:13.25]So I got to find like something to dump in there.
[67:14.91]There's something in the garage.
[67:20.96]You need the octane booster.
[67:22.36]All right.
[67:22.70]Octane booster.
[67:24.68]It's out, it's in the garage.
[67:27.14]All right.
[67:27.48]So I, all right.
[67:28.80]So I got, I can, I can sabotage, get the octane booster, wherever that is.
[67:32.96]I'm assuming this garage is this way, right?
[67:41.32]Pooping the gas tank.
[67:43.36]That's a classic engineer joke.
[67:55.47]Whoa.
[67:55.57]Okay.
[67:55.67]Okay.
[67:55.77]Nice.
[67:55.87]Alright.
[67:56.03]Booster's down here.
[68:26.64]Hey, bro.
[68:27.64]Was that, uh... Was that octane shit you're talking about?
[68:36.42]Was that octane shit?
[68:37.53]Right here?
[68:37.83]Oh, that.
[68:45.21]There's a bottle of Cronstance patented octane booster mixture somewhere in the loading bay.
[68:49.81]Okay.
[68:51.46]It's somewhere in here.
[68:57.03]This is going to be such a pain in the ass to find this.
[69:02.43]Over here?
[69:10.15]Octane?
[69:12.99]Where's it at?
[69:15.63]Am I blind?
[69:17.72]This VR, man.
[69:19.12]It's like a completely different world in here.
[69:22.44]That's not it.
[69:22.98]That's a whiskey.
[69:25.50]Chug the octane.
[69:28.07]It's marked for you?
[69:32.74]It's not, though.
[69:35.14]Over here?
[69:39.54]Is that it right there?
[69:40.18]Nope.
[69:44.40]Is this it?
[69:50.87]VR Andy.
[69:52.09]Find the octane tank near the... Oh my god, it was so fast!
[69:56.35]It's upstairs?
[70:04.76]No, not there.
[70:05.45]That's a fire axe.
[70:11.25]You know I'm going to take that, right?
[70:14.13]Oh my... Okay.
[70:15.29]Alright.
[70:15.65]Like, holy shit.
[70:22.44]You can't give me the fire axe right now.
[70:25.52]Octane.
[70:26.90]Is it an energy drink?
[70:27.84]Is it like one of these?
[70:29.26]I can't take this.
[70:29.80]That's a bad idea.
[70:31.52]I'll take these though for sure.
[70:34.01]Um, pick it up.
[70:34.59]Fucking God, put it away!
[70:45.78]Where is this shit?
[70:51.09]Where's the octane?
[70:56.75]I don't see it anywhere.
[71:00.56]It's on the shelf, shelf, shelf, shelf.
[71:09.57]It's all the way in the corner.
[71:13.16]You can't say blind.
[71:14.52]It's literally a tiny bottle of Tylenol sitting in the very corner of the map.
[71:20.24]Don't drop this.
[71:27.14]Okay, here we go.
[71:27.88]Save it.
[71:35.61]Alright, I'm going to get this right now.
[71:37.93]I'm at least going to complete one of these missions in VR.
[71:44.82]Now I can go take care of this.
[71:46.02]This is going to be cool.
[71:48.66]I'm actually... This is actually exciting to me.
[71:51.01]I'm actually very excited right now.
[71:58.85]Reset calibration.
[72:00.48]Okay.
[72:09.61]Alright, there's the car.
[72:12.69]Don't do anything weird.
[72:13.97]Just be a normal person.
[72:15.33]Don't do anything weird.
[72:20.51]Sorry, that was awful.
[72:21.97]I was like sticking my tongue out at him.
[72:24.94]Sorry.
[72:26.14]Okay.
[72:30.58]So sabotage the car and then put the octane in?
[72:39.51]Okay, I'm ready.
[72:44.45]What?
[72:44.71]What is this dude?
[72:45.61]What?
[72:45.89]I guess it makes sense.
[72:50.63]I guess it makes sense.
[72:51.47]You know what?
[72:52.01]It does make sense.
[72:53.43]He distracted me!
[73:09.88]Do not press that button.
[73:12.02]Okay, so I can't... Nobody can look at me.
[73:14.36]I get it.
[73:21.60]Take the axe and just go crazy.
[73:24.00]No.
[73:25.52]Let me at least get to the end of one of these missions before I do anything insane.
[73:30.71]So I gotta wait till this guy looks away.
[73:32.61]Wait till you leave.
[73:33.49]I get it.
[73:34.05]I understand it.
[73:34.67]Don't worry.
[73:40.41]Alright, now... I need you to get out of the way.
[73:49.14]Come on.
[73:50.02]Okay.
[73:52.93]Hey, you're not just gonna leave that there, are you?
[73:54.49]Say what?
[73:57.91]Yo, bro.
[73:58.45]Go check it out.
[73:58.87]Give me a solid.
[73:59.67]Check that out, will ya?
[74:08.97]How do I get him to get out of here?
[74:10.15]Leave.
[74:11.63]We don't need two security guards looking at the exact same place.
[74:15.12]You can leave.
[74:17.62]Yes.
[74:20.31]And I don't appreciate being photographed without my permission.
[74:26.31]Thank you very much.
[74:41.66]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[74:42.70]We're good.
[74:42.98]Now he's gonna call the guy.
[74:48.18]Call him.
[74:48.56]Get him down here.
[74:49.58]He needs to fix that.
[75:03.67]I feel so devilish.
[75:04.85]I really do.
[75:05.39]I don't know.
[75:05.67]Something about being in the VR mode is like, I'm so devilish.
[75:09.12]Save it right now?
[75:35.86]Alright, where's he at?
[75:38.74]He's over there.
[75:39.45]You're going to take a long ass time to get over here, aren't you?
[75:47.61]You need to hit the yoinky splinky.
[75:56.90]Alright.
[76:04.22]I'm a security guard too.
[76:10.79]Is he smoking?
[76:11.65]I don't think he should be smoking.
[76:14.95]Do you think he should be smoking?
[76:16.65]Stop smoking.
[76:17.21]He's talking to me?
[76:17.71]You want me to do this?
[76:19.49]Is it me you want me to do this?
[76:20.61]You want me to do this?
[76:22.17]Am I doing this?
[76:25.53]He told me to get in the car!
[76:27.53]You told me to get in the car!
[76:33.03]He said get in the fucking car he said get in the car everybody heard it You said to get in the car, oh my god, it's taking me very strong to not punch you Okay, fine, I'm a security guard oh my fucking god, oh
[77:07.93]He told me to get in the car.
[77:09.05]Don't let him take control of the situation.
[77:22.99]He told me to get in the car!
[77:25.31]That's so unfair.
[77:26.43]Hey, you there, go get in that car and I'll press the gas when I tell you.
[77:31.81]Oh, get out of the car, man!
[77:33.65]What the fuck?
[77:34.28]Oh, come on.
[77:38.19]Was he even talking to me?
[77:39.47]Alright, we have to wait for him again.
[77:52.27]This was on the phone.
[77:54.50]You're out of frame.
[77:55.74]Oh.
[77:55.86]I'll fix that.
[78:05.66]You need to bring the octane to the car, but after putting it in, you need to... So now I have to be an engineer.
[78:15.19]I get you.
[78:15.69]I get it.
[78:16.21]Alright.
[78:16.77]I gotta be an engineer.
[78:17.53]No, because I know what happened last time.
[78:20.11]Not doing that.
[78:20.65]Which one of you two motherfuckers am I gonna take?
[78:50.43]He's taunting me.
[79:13.64]Hey!
[79:14.90]What happened?
[79:15.94]What the fuck happened?
[79:17.38]I'm alright.
[79:17.98]I don't think something's wrong with him, though.
[79:19.16]What happened to him?
[79:20.22]Is he okay?
[79:26.55]It's... I can't even see.
[79:28.13]It's so dark.
[79:54.15]Open this shit.
[79:55.01]There's nobody even in here, right?
[79:56.81]Not really.
[79:57.19]Wait, there's an engineer down here.
[79:58.31]Are you alone?
[79:58.72]There's two of you.
[80:00.88]Wait, I can get you to... Give me the fucking screwdriver.
[80:22.53]Oh my god.
[80:23.87]It's so sloppy.
[80:28.95]I want to cement my feet to the ground.
[80:34.06]What just fucking happened?
[80:35.60]What happened?
[80:37.32]What was that?
[80:38.64]What happened?
[80:39.28]Huh?
[80:44.40]What happened?
[80:48.60]What happened out here?
[80:50.64]Who did that?
[80:52.63]Which way you did that?
[80:55.91]That was fucked up, whoever did that.
[81:02.64]Hunting?
[81:03.20]For what?
[81:03.90]What did I do wrong?
[81:04.84]I'm so confused.
[81:06.80]Did it kill him?
[81:11.70]The car just exploded.
[81:12.86]Nobody even got hurt.
[81:14.46]Okay.
[81:27.73]I'm so confused.
[81:28.81]I honestly don't even know what happened.
[81:35.73]Can anybody explain why that happened?
[81:37.51]Did I take too long?
[81:43.59]Okay, here we go.
[81:44.87]Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[81:45.93]No more fucking around.
[81:46.65]Kill the guy with the screwdriver, take his disguise, and just run in there and turn the gas on.
[81:59.69]What?
[82:00.87]Okay.
[82:01.85]That was... That was fucking crazy.
[82:03.69]No!
[82:03.75]Please!
[82:30.64]Okay.
[82:33.98]Somebody got in and turned the car on.
[82:36.22]I have to get this guy.
[82:37.36]This is so much easier in third person.
[82:39.04]You just throw a coin over there and the guy is going to go over there.
[82:42.88]Getting a coin out of here is like, I feel like I have a thousand things in my pocket.
[82:49.81]Okay.
[82:50.59]Coin.
[82:51.51]Got coin.
[82:52.63]Throw coin that way.
[82:55.41]Both of you go over there and look at it.
[82:59.11]Is this illegal for me to take that?
[83:00.09]Okay.
[83:00.85]All right, all right, all right, all right.
[83:03.80]All right, all right.
[83:04.30]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[83:05.06]This is perfect.
[83:13.46]Oh, fuck you, game.
[83:18.46]At least he's gone.
[83:23.98]Wait.
[83:26.55]Save it.
[83:27.29]Save it right now.
[83:35.71]Okay, game saved.
[83:38.89]I'm now an engineer.
[83:39.55]I'm ready to go.
[83:43.19]What the?
[83:45.18]No!
[83:45.34]That was coming!
[83:46.06]I was right here!
[83:47.74]He's still alive!
[83:51.16]How are you still alive, sir?
[83:53.20]Sir, it's a miracle that you're still alive.
[83:55.74]It's remarkable.
[83:58.36]God damn it.
[84:07.40]I have to run as fast as I can from this point.
[84:10.40]Here we go.
[84:12.27]All right, center, center, center, center, get centered.
[84:15.59]Center, center, center, center, center, run.
[84:19.03]I gotta be the one that blows it up.
[84:20.15]Ready?
[84:20.54]Three, two, one, action.
[84:32.71]No!
[84:34.47]Who is doing that?
[84:36.13]Who is doing that?
[84:37.37]Why did he turn it on?
[84:38.81]You guys are fucking idiots.
[84:42.32]Why is he here?
[84:43.66]Why did you do that?
[84:45.54]What's wrong with you?
[84:46.60]This... Oh, that's right.
[84:50.08]You're right.
[84:50.72]No, you're right.
[84:51.88]You're right.
[84:52.32]You're right.
[84:53.80]I gotta be faster than that.
[84:56.90]You're too far gone.
[84:58.36]I am... I can get there.
[85:05.49]Do a smaller level.
[85:07.53]I can get it.
[85:08.29]I gotta go faster.
[85:09.51]I went the wrong way.
[85:10.23]I gotta go the other way.
[85:12.58]I legit have to run to the left side and push that other engineer out of the way.
[85:18.40]I have to save that guy.
[85:20.42]Alright, come on.
[85:22.10]Where am I?
[85:35.64]Oh my, they do it faster every time!
[85:37.66]You're slower every time.
[85:51.09]Alright, not this time, motherfucker.
[85:53.11]I'm gonna go!
[85:54.69]Go, go, here we go.
[86:10.83]I gotta do this fast
[86:40.37]Wait, throw a coin at the wall.
[86:42.39]That's actually brilliant.
[86:43.52]Hold on.
[86:43.80]Let me just do this quick.
[86:52.34]I don't care.
[86:52.78]I'm here.
[86:55.34]I'm here.
[86:55.80]I'm here.
[86:56.46]I made it.
[86:56.87]I made it.
[86:59.27]I made it.
[87:00.89]I'm here to turn the car on.
[87:11.37]I'm gonna try that tactic and throw the coin at the wall.
[87:19.14]Why do I have to turn around every time, by the way?
[87:21.28]Like... I'm not gonna fuck around.
[87:25.44]Coin's coming out.
[87:26.24]I can freeze the game.
[87:28.70]That's so brilliant, by the way.
[87:30.87]Freeze.
[87:31.93]Coin.
[87:33.11]Against the wall, right here.
[87:34.61]Why do I think I fucked this guy?
[87:37.85]I can't count, though.
[87:45.64]It didn't work.
[87:46.56]That guy fell from the rafters.
[87:50.94]He was naked up there.
[87:52.40]I don't know what he was doing up there, but dude, come on.
[87:54.68]I need to do an even earlier save than that?
[87:58.63]Fuck.
[87:59.23]Okay.
[88:02.41]Alright, so here's the plan.
[88:05.07]I'm gonna whip a coin over.
[88:07.85]And then I'm gonna get this guy.
[88:10.77]Oh my goodness gracious...
[88:15.04]Okay, give me the coin.
[88:19.01]I'm gonna distract these guys with the coin out here.
[88:23.29]You know, just like, fucking who cares?
[88:24.61]Just throw it over there.
[88:27.54]Okay, they're distracted, they're distracted, they're distracted.
[88:47.88]where am I I'm trying to walk forward he's walking backwards oh my god this game get up get up what
[89:23.74]I distracted... I distracted him with the coin and it didn't even matter.
[89:30.26]I will get this.
[89:35.82]I can assure you.
[89:36.56]Okay, coin.
[89:43.72]I got an idea.
[89:44.12]Here's the idea.
[89:44.64]Ready?
[89:49.82]Oh, my God.
[89:50.46]What the hell?
[89:51.94]Why?
[89:52.36]I didn't... Hold.
[89:53.72]Throw.
[89:54.44]Oh, my God.
[89:55.72]Hey, you.
[89:57.20]I think you left this behind.
[89:58.76]Okay.
[90:02.78]Perfect!
[90:03.76]Whoa.
[90:04.48]Huh?
[90:06.18]What was that?
[90:09.28]Check it out.
[90:10.22]Roger that.
[90:13.10]Bingo.
[90:18.05]Blow it up.
[90:18.81]Blow it up.
[90:19.25]Blow it up.
[90:20.07]Blow it up.
[90:21.19]I'm here.
[90:21.45]I'm ready.
[90:21.69]All right.
[90:22.59]How do I blow it up?
[90:23.15]What do I do?
[90:25.45]Step on the gas quick.
[90:26.77]Step on the gas.
[90:27.47]Step on the gas.
[90:28.83]Step on the gas.
[90:29.87]How do I step on the gas?
[90:31.45]How do you step on the gas?
[90:32.29]How do you step on the gas?
[90:33.45]How do you step on the gas?
[90:34.51]What?
[90:47.08]What the fuck?
[90:48.86]What?!
[90:49.20]I pressed B!
[90:50.66]Start engine, I just did it!
[90:54.30]Start engine.
[90:55.68]B. It's B on- It's B on the- on my left hand.
[91:04.63]Not on my right hand.
[91:06.59]It's the other B. Why does it- why is it not B1 and B2?
[91:10.79]A1 and A2?
[91:16.04]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[91:26.46]Give me the coin, quick.
[91:29.72]Why is it not B1 and B2?
[91:30.90]I don't understand.
[91:32.16]Okay.
[91:36.24]I gotta get this right.
[91:41.46]I can't do it anymore!
[91:46.35]Why is it so finicky?
[91:48.13]It's such a piece of shit.
[91:55.53]I will get it.
[92:08.02]What if I shoot the gun?
[92:18.94]Oh, I did it.
[92:19.36]I got it.
[92:19.56]I got it.
[92:19.74]I got it.
[92:19.94]I'm good.
[92:20.12]I'm good.
[92:20.30]I'm good.
[92:20.52]All right, let's just turn the key and see.
[92:22.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[92:22.91]Let me do it.
[92:23.71]Sir, don't touch it.
[92:26.55]I can't.
[92:43.50]I'm only doing this one more time.
[92:53.93]This is my last attempt at this.
[92:56.49]And then I'm gonna go to a different level.
[93:05.26]Okay.
[93:06.94]I need to go out there and, like, distract them.
[93:08.54]Don't let them do anything yet.
[93:22.74]Huh?
[93:24.02]okay all right give me the coin now I don't want any loose ends well you waiting for a written invitation what if I just do it get in the car what if I just do it and turn it on right now am I gonna get in trouble what if I just do it right now just turn the car I'm afraid this is you you can't be here who do you think you are
[93:49.37]You have to be an engineer to turn the car on.
[93:55.14]You have to be an engineer.
[94:01.12]Oh my god, damn it.
[94:02.56]Okay.
[94:03.56]Alright.
[94:06.22]Alright.
[94:07.70]Alright, I give up.
[94:09.48]One more try?
[94:10.00]Alright, fine.
[94:11.34]I actually give up.
[94:12.04]We're doing another level after this.
[94:14.56]Just stab him in the head and run.
[94:16.28]I'm gonna stab him in the head and run.
[94:18.86]If I can't get it.
[94:19.68]I need to distract with the coin immediately.
[94:21.48]As soon as it levels load up.
[94:22.46]Okay, get the coin.
[94:36.51]I give up.
[94:37.35]I'm done.
[94:38.91]I'm done with this.
[94:40.37]I'm done with this fucking piece of shit.
[94:42.09]I'm done.
[94:44.37]I give up.
[94:51.19]I didn't want to throw it at you.
[94:52.93]You know what?
[94:54.01]I've had enough of this level.
[94:55.46]I've had enough of this.
[94:56.80]I've had enough of this.
[94:58.00]Did I tell you?
[94:58.88]Wrong save.
[94:59.94]Well, I still have to get the engineer costume from the other guy.
[95:09.45]Okay, I only get like an extra five to six seconds on the other save and I have to get that guy's disguise.
[95:18.64]I have another idea.
[95:21.54]I promise this is the final attempt.
[95:24.38]I'm gonna shoot my gun just at the wall and then drop it.
[95:29.82]That will distract everybody.
[95:47.04]Good.
[95:47.28]See?
[95:50.77]Okay.
[95:50.99]Alright, alright, alright.
[95:51.69]We're good.
[95:55.11]Okay.
[95:57.87]Alright.
[95:59.17]When everybody relaxes... When everybody relaxes, we can start this again.
[96:02.92]It's all getting locked down.
[96:09.80]He's going to come back.
[96:16.54]Watch this.
[96:16.96]He's going to come back.
[96:19.86]There he is right there.
[96:20.54]25 meters.
[96:22.66]23 meters.
[96:27.32]Eventually the lockdown is going to be over.
[96:29.02]And we're going to be fine.
[96:32.82]Here he comes.
[96:33.54]He's coming back up.
[96:36.94]Okay.
[96:38.74]He's turning the corner.
[96:42.14]He's walking a little bit further away.
[96:51.27]They'll be back.
[96:52.95]Right now we're on searching.
[96:55.13]When that's off of searching in like another 30 seconds, 10 seconds, they're coming back.
[97:02.92]Right?
[97:12.68]Still searching?
[97:15.50]Where is he?
[97:21.77]Alright, what is he doing?
[97:24.39]He's right here.
[97:33.56]Okay.
[97:37.06]Okay, here we go.
[97:39.52]We're good.
[97:41.40]Your car is waiting.
[97:42.86]Your car is waiting for you, sir.
[97:43.83]I know there was a little bit of chaos earlier here, but we're back on schedule.
[97:50.29]To get the car, uh, for you to check the car out.
[97:53.99]Don't forget about that.
[97:54.71]Forget about that naked guy.
[97:56.37]Not a problem.
[97:58.24]Alright, so, again, I heard this weird rattling in the engine.
[98:01.16]I didn't really know what was going on.
[98:03.98]So... Let me see if I can get in there and help you.
[98:07.92]No, no, no!
[98:08.68]Let me do it!
[98:09.76]Let me do it!
[98:11.69]Okay.
[98:31.65]I'm so disappointed.
[98:38.16]My disappointment is so... It's so high right now.
[98:41.14]I thought he was going to go to the back of the car and do his little routine again.
[98:44.50]Oh, man.
[98:52.17]I didn't even save it either.
[98:53.23]I...
[98:54.76]I know.
[98:55.81]I thought it was just in the bag.
[98:56.79]Alright, we know it works.
[98:58.17]I'm gonna go for it again.
[98:58.93]And then we can just chill.
[99:00.97]And then I'm gonna take a break.
[99:02.41]Shoot the gun real quick.
[99:04.17]I'm gonna go and sit in the car and wait for this asshole to come back.
[99:09.02]I promise this is the final attempt.
[99:10.70]This is the last time we're gonna do this.
[99:12.06]I promise.
[99:14.42]I promise.
[99:22.52]Okay.
[99:23.14]Now just go sit in the car so he can't do it.
[99:37.17]Okay.
[99:38.03]Save the game.
[99:38.91]Go sit in the car.
[99:40.99]No one's gonna care.
[99:45.13]This one right here.
[99:47.28]Okay.
[99:47.86]We're good now.
[99:48.62]Jeez.
[99:50.48]I am ready.
[99:56.33]Please, I need to know.
[99:57.11]I don't know whatever that was.
[99:58.51]Been here five minutes and he's already fucked up twice.
[100:03.87]Where is he going?
[100:04.39]He goes all the way over there.
[100:05.35]He goes down.
[100:05.99]He comes up here.
[100:07.46]He walks.
[100:09.38]He walks over there and then they don't care.
[100:12.70]Sit in the car.
[100:19.06]I'm waiting for this dickhead.
[100:22.53]Save it again.
[100:27.86]Right here.
[100:30.23]Win or lose, I'm taking a pee break.
[100:36.39]Is there another Mike?
[100:37.47]Mike, Mike, Mike.
[100:39.11]Huh?
[100:42.78]Mike?
[100:43.46]What's good?
[100:44.40]We good?
[100:48.42]Mike, is that right?
[100:51.44]But how come I can't turn it on now?
[100:58.93]Mike is fine.
[100:59.41]Okay, good.
[101:10.13]So it's B... Oh, it does say right B, doesn't it?
[101:13.81]Okay.
[101:17.31]It's left B to turn the car on.
[101:18.85]Good.
[101:19.01]Alright.
[101:20.47]Here we go.
[101:29.14]Save it again.
[101:29.74]Right here.
[101:34.03]Right there.
[101:34.53]Okay.
[101:35.11]Good.
[101:43.07]Remember, your other controller is on an Xbox layout.

[101:53.71]I'm just waiting around for these guys.
[101:54.98]Where are they?
[102:00.92]Okay, here he comes.

[102:28.18]What are you waiting for?
[102:30.20]Go look at the engine.
[102:34.18]Is he in range?

[103:45.29]Do not load the game.
[103:46.07]Save the game.
[103:46.83]I don't know.
[103:47.13]How did that not kill him?
[103:48.65]I can't save it.
[103:49.15]I'm in combat.
[103:51.90]Where are they?
[103:53.24]Nobody's around me right now.
[104:02.44]Okay, I got to get that guy's costume.
[104:05.95]No, I think I can leave this way.
[104:07.11]I think, right?

[104:18.34]Where am I going?
[104:19.14]Where am I?

[110:05.22]All right, going in.

[111:34.98]Pac-Man or 47?
[111:35.54]What do you think?
[111:40.02]Who's more iconic in 2021?
[111:41.34]Pac-Man or 47?
[111:43.82]Yeah, it's probably... It's definitely... It's definitely...
[111:59.93]This doesn't work.
[112:01.47]You can't strangle people in this game.
[112:13.54]Should I make it look like he got hit by the vacuum?
[112:16.24]Who's that?
[112:16.66]Somebody coming?
[112:19.94]Where can I put this guy?
[112:23.55]I need... Wait.
[112:24.43]Okay.

[112:25.91]Is there any intel in here?
[112:32.88]Anybody?
[112:35.25]Intel?
[112:36.07]I thought that was shit.
[112:39.47]Crowbar.
[112:45.07]I might need that later.
[112:46.53]Screwdriver.
[112:47.07]I just got all these tools.
[112:48.61]Sick.
[112:50.15]Okay.

[113:09.01]Where am I going?
[113:09.67]I need some intel.
[113:16.21]Alright, intel.
[113:18.80]Global innovation.
[113:21.50]Knox the mechanic.
[113:22.08]I did that one.
[113:24.00]I did that one.
[113:26.78]Mission stories.
[113:27.52]Here we go.
[113:28.94]A perfect machine.
[113:30.92]In, uh, intravenous.
[113:33.83]The munchies.
[113:39.22]I can't do any of these.
[113:40.82]I guess I can do this one.
[113:41.84]I think I did this one already.
[113:45.92]Alright, so where do I go for this one?
[113:48.28]Mission story.
[113:52.62]Where do I go?
[113:53.08]It's a medic area.
[114:02.23]Okay.
[114:08.03]All right, just get me out of here.
[114:13.02]I'm dressed as this guy.
[114:14.10]All right, the medic area.
[114:18.36]Okay, I guess I'm gonna leave out here and then I'm gonna go to the medical area.
[114:36.44]Medbay.
[114:36.88]It's on the ground level where the road is.
[114:40.47]Okay.
[114:49.01]Where the road is?
[114:49.85]I'm just like wandering in a random direction right now, aren't I?
[114:56.98]Doctor, doctor, doctor.
[114:58.16]Be a car guy.
[114:59.46]Kill that guy.
[115:01.74]Other side of the track.
[115:02.94]Okay.
[115:04.32]I got it.
[115:14.79]Yep.
[115:18.71]Can you open this gate?
[115:25.34]Don't bump- I'm trying not to bump him.
[115:28.22]It is a good race today.
[115:30.46]Yeah, sure.
[115:30.94]Alright, I gotta go that way.
[115:33.46]Underground.
[115:35.86]I feel like I'm playing this with tank controls.
[115:39.72]Because 47 can only move, like, forwards.
[115:45.46]Alright, there we go.
[115:45.92]Let's go.
[115:53.61]Why are you so tiny?
[115:55.77]I'm a small person.
[115:57.81]I'm f- I'm five foot eight.
[116:00.61]I'm a small person.
[116:01.45]I'm a kind of a small person.
[116:03.13]Okay?
[116:11.02]That's why I play games like this.
[116:12.00]Make me look big and tall.
[116:16.14]Do I hear an auto?
[116:18.78]Do I hear auto?
[116:21.02]Oh, here we go.
[116:21.90]Okay.
[116:37.11]Poor Dr. Sorenson.
[116:39.07]First, he almost loses a patient to a seemingly harmless case of dehydration.
[116:43.67]Now he has to deal with this guy suffering from urinary retention.
[116:49.15]Not his day.
[116:50.15]I think we did this when I played this a few years ago.
[116:52.03]Screw up the revitalization procedure on Miss Knox.
[116:55.75]Got it.
[116:55.93]Follow the story mission.
[116:56.49]Sure.
[116:56.63]Sure.
[117:18.14]Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[117:19.16]He's in here.
[117:19.56]I gotta get in here.
[117:20.73]I have my... Hi!
[117:22.93]Just lookin' to see the doctor!
[117:24.43]Alright.
[117:24.75]As long as it's in hand, I guess.
[117:51.02]What's up, dude?
[117:54.42]Hey, do you... Do you know anything about Clash of Clans?
[117:58.86]I'm fucking stuck on this one.
[118:00.04]Fuck!
[118:06.30]Good thing that didn't happen.
[118:07.71]I'm so glad that didn't happen because I didn't save it for a long time.
[118:11.65]That would have been really bad.
[118:17.71]Thank God.
[118:26.32]Oh, man.
[118:28.12]Dude.
[118:29.62]Hey, dude, you gotta watch this.
[118:30.52]You gotta watch this fucking TikTok cringe compilation, dude.
[118:32.76]It's so funny.
[118:33.68]Come on.
[118:36.52]What do I do?
[118:38.86]I just want to say that this is a damn fine rate.
[118:42.85]I'm coming in.
[118:43.39]Attention, Sierra Knox.
[118:45.75]That was a joke.
[118:46.73]I'm not coming in.
[118:47.51]Attention, Sierra Knox.
[118:54.23]Your vitamin...
[118:57.26]Wait, the doctor!
[118:57.97]I gotta be a doctor!
[118:58.77]I gotta be a doctor!
[119:03.89]I gotta be a doctor.
[119:06.79]I gotta go over there.
[119:08.65]How do I get over there?
[119:10.90]Where's Otto?
[119:14.02]Otto!
[119:15.32]What are you doing over here?
[119:17.46]No, don't lie down!
[119:20.28]Otto!
[119:22.65]He's just lying on the ground.
[119:26.65]What are you doing over here?
[119:27.89]I don't want to step on you.
[119:30.21]What happened to the game?
[119:30.81]What happened to the game?
[119:38.59]What's going on?
[119:42.13]Did Otto unplug something?
[119:46.91]I think Otto may have unplugged a cord.
[119:52.92]The game crashed?
[119:57.62]Auto!
[120:00.42]Mission complete.
[120:01.12]There's something I might've unplugged.
[120:04.76]Hold on.
[120:07.71]What happened?
[120:09.59]Oh yeah, Hitman's gone.
[120:13.25]Hitman's not even here anymore.
[120:17.29]What happened?
[120:20.93]The game actually crashed.
[120:21.99]All right, hold on, let me fix this.
[120:26.17]Give me one sec.
[120:31.83]That's running.
[120:35.17]I'm not joking, what was it?
[120:39.12]I'm not joking, there's a wasp in here.
[120:40.44]There's not a wasp in here.
[120:45.74]So here's the real problem.
[120:49.22]Opening Hitman is a disaster.
[120:54.02]When I finally got the game to run,
[120:56.74]I couldn't leave it.
[120:58.16]So this is going to be a nightmare.
[121:01.53]Let me see if this works.
[121:02.25]Because the game specifically says do not open the game if SteamVR is open.
[121:12.84]Let's see what happens.
[121:16.26]It's such a mess.
[121:21.58]Hold on.
[121:24.70]Play whatever you want.
[121:25.44]I mean, I kind of want to keep playing this.
[121:26.60]Yeah, I got to exit SteamVR.
[121:34.13]Hold on.
[121:36.58]I have to restart SteamVR.
[122:36.79]All right, I'm back.
[122:39.77]Here's a real question.
[122:40.63]I think I lost chat.
[122:44.05]We're about to find out.
[122:47.13]This was the biggest problem that I had with this, setting this up, was every time I opened up the thing that captures chat, Hitman would run at two FPS and crash.
[122:56.56]Let's see.
[122:59.38]Find out.
[123:05.88]Let us find out.
[123:09.34]I'm back in VR.
[123:10.58]There's no wasp in here.
[123:12.14]All right, there we go.
[123:15.24]I should be good.
[123:16.26]Let me see if it's still on there.
[123:17.40]Can I see you guys?
[123:18.20]Okay, Steam is opening VR.
[123:25.27]Oh, my God, that's loud.
[123:29.99]Shit, I lost chat.
[123:33.15]Oh, please.
[123:33.87]Ah!
[123:36.51]And you guys can't even see it.
[123:40.47]This is the exact same problem I had last time.
[123:42.76]I'm probably gonna have to change games, because this took like two hours to set up.
[123:46.92]And now I physically can't even get... What the fuck, man?
[123:52.26]Fucking PhD to play Hitman 3 in VR.
[123:57.31]Can I see it?
[123:57.91]Come on, please load.
[124:00.33]Load, please!
[124:02.17]Do it!
[124:02.47]I think I lost the chat.
[124:07.21]I can't play with chat if I'm gonna play Hitman.
[124:12.43]Hold on, wait, let me try this.
[124:17.57]Technically it's running.
[124:20.59]Shit!
[124:22.99]Yeah, I can't see chat anymore.
[124:27.45]And it's gonna be a huge pain in the ass to get it back.
[124:31.92]Or maybe it's not, hold on, give me one more second.
[124:39.68]Where are my hands?
[124:42.67]Oh, come on.
[124:44.71]Oh, this is going to take like an hour to fix.
[124:49.99]Play Squid Game?
[124:57.52]Next game.
[124:57.84]All right, I'm going to change games.
[125:01.08]I may have lost the chat for the rest of the stream, by the way.
[125:03.24]Because that was a monumental pain in the ass to get that to work.
[125:11.03]Especially with Hitman, it's like a fucking nightmare to try to get it to work with this on Index for some reason.
[125:18.29]Let me try one more thing.
[125:20.17]Why does everything that launches on day one not fucking ever work the way it's supposed to?
[125:24.01]Hold on.
[125:29.64]Because I have, like, access to this.
[125:31.18]I don't know why I can't open it.
[125:35.66]And it technically should be... Hold on a sec.
[125:39.12]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[125:41.43]Come on, come on, come on.
[125:42.37]Let me see it.
[125:48.67]Fuck.
[125:49.63]Why do I have to redo the whole thing in this overlay?
[125:52.28]Alright, if this takes more than one full minute, I want everyone to scream it's been one minute from now.
[126:06.65]Okay, here we go.
[126:09.02]If it's been one minute, scream.
[126:24.55]All right, chat is back.
[126:28.07]Hold on.
[126:28.75]Fuck.
[126:29.69]Come on, dude.
[126:37.45]Come on, man.
[126:41.33]No!
[126:43.87]No!
[126:44.93]Oh, it's such a pain in the fucking ass.
[126:47.33]It really is.
[126:47.87]I had it and I just lost it again.
[126:53.22]Where the fuck did it go?
[126:57.80]Yeah, getting chat on your wrist is like an unbearable process sometimes.
[127:02.94]It's so fucking annoying.
[127:05.58]I don't even know what's going on.
[127:07.12]It's crashed again.
[127:10.61]It's been one minute.
[127:11.51]All right, I'm moving on.
[127:14.34]But I still have to set the chat up though, so it doesn't even matter.
[127:16.32]All right, I actually have to go BRB before I scream into this microphone as loud as I can.
[127:22.97]I'll be right back.
[129:13.88]Alright, I've restarted a couple times, I think.
[129:16.70]I got it.
[129:18.96]I believe we're good.
[129:21.26]I could be wrong.
[129:22.14]I hope I'm not wrong.
[129:23.00]We'll find out very shortly.
[129:25.82]Can you see?
[129:26.32]And guess what?
[129:30.95]Boink!
[129:31.99]Chat's back.
[129:34.53]I just needed to take a breather and just not, like, scream.
[129:41.19]I told you, like, I wasn't going to scream.
[129:48.60]And again, like I told you, you need, like, four people in the room with you to get this to work.
[129:54.90]And I know, I've seen those other goggles, right?
[129:56.94]The other, like, VR goggles?
[129:59.54]They're, like, fucking 200p.
[130:01.58]Like, it's not gonna happen.
[130:02.90]Give me another 30 years, and maybe you'll have fun in this.
[130:05.54]Alright, here we go.
[130:07.46]Destinations.
[130:09.63]I was doing this.
[130:10.25]Let's load it.
[130:10.73]Can I load it from here?
[130:18.88]Load game.
[130:22.12]Um, hello?
[130:25.97]Alright, let's move.
[130:27.79]Where was it?
[130:28.17]Right here?
[130:29.37]Bingo.
[130:29.93]Alright.
[130:30.39]Everybody relax.
[130:31.73]We're fine.
[130:40.42]I muted?
[130:41.74]I screamed a bunch of obscenities?
[130:47.10]My voice is a little harsh now because I screamed so many swears.
[130:50.26]Hmm.
[131:04.00]All right.
[131:04.80]Hey, you.
[131:07.96]Sorry, I dropped my crowbar.
[131:09.16]That was in my pocket.
[131:10.54]Thank you.
[131:11.62]Appreciate it, young man.
[131:12.60]Never know where you're going to need one of those.
[131:17.25]Alright, I gotta go find the doctor.
[131:20.23]That's a glass door.
[131:23.41]Doctor is this way.
[131:24.89]I betcha I can just fucking walk through this now because they're not paying any attention.
[131:28.78]We're gonna go for it in one, two, three, go.
[131:43.12]Save it quick!
[131:49.68]Nice.
[131:50.78]Good.
[131:52.08]Your voice is always so harsh.
[131:53.18]Alright, where's this guy?
[132:04.17]Come here, come here.
[132:05.59]I got a secret to tell you.
[132:06.93]Oh, fuck off.
[132:23.55]Bastards.
[132:30.64]Where's that guy?
[132:31.90]He's coming around?
[132:33.26]Oh shit, is he gonna go all the way?
[132:36.08]Wait a minute.
[132:41.72]Okay, back to business.
[132:48.50]You alright?
[132:49.10]Are you okay?
[132:50.06]You okay?
[132:50.42]Somebody just hit you with the crowbar, dude.
[132:56.16]Get over here.
[132:56.62]Alright, where do I dump him?
[133:07.09]I'll just put him right here and then save it.
[133:25.85]Alright, we got it.
[133:26.58]Bingo.
[133:30.46]Alright.
[133:32.40]Let's go.
[133:33.52]Doctor's over there.
[133:34.28]I am a doctor.
[133:34.88]He's in there.
[133:54.08]Doctor?
[133:55.14]What?
[133:58.31]Why am I in here?
[134:02.13]Poisons.
[134:03.97]Poison.
[134:05.57]Uh, what's this?
[134:12.64]Syringe.
[134:15.06]Oh, shit.
[134:16.44]Okay.
[134:20.92]How does this work?
[134:30.67]How does this work?
[134:31.19]I'm curious.
[134:37.98]What?
[135:05.00]I forgot you were in here!
[135:06.62]Sir!
[135:14.04]Okay, I know how it works.
[135:16.22]You just have to stick it into their head.
[135:19.96]You just have to stick it into their head.
[135:27.51]Look at me!
[135:31.01]Get rid of the patient.
[135:35.87]paging a doctor.
[135:36.91]Alright, I gotta get in.
[135:38.77]There's a patient in here and I have to get rid of them.
[135:41.31]Oh, let me recalibrate.
[135:42.21]Sick!
[135:59.06]What?
[135:59.22]How am I supposed to get rid of you?
[136:00.78]Oh shit, poisoned the IV.
[136:03.00]Overflow the sink.
[136:33.86]You can't do that in this game.
[136:35.44]It's not even possible.
[136:36.72]You can't do it.
[136:37.58]Get over here.
[137:04.36]Wait, is he alive?
[137:05.34]Dude, what kind of control scheme are you fucking playing with here?
[137:23.67]Now what?
[137:27.01]Disguise?
[137:27.69]Should I disguise as this guy?
[137:38.80]Now what do I do?
[137:39.32]I have to kill that guy?
[137:43.03]No, I don't.
[137:48.45]I have to kill this guy?
[137:49.41]Are you serious?
[137:57.82]I don't think that did anything.
[138:02.98]I don't like this.
[138:03.58]I don't want to do that.
[138:06.15]Now what?
[138:08.09]Oh wait, I can page the, uh... I can page... I can page to say that we're ready for the next patient.
[138:23.81]I have arrived.
[138:27.61]Paging Ms.
[138:28.53]Knox.
[138:29.25]Paging Ms.
[138:29.91]Knox.
[138:31.39]Your treatment is ready for you.
[138:33.67]Okay.
[138:34.31]Dr. Severus.
[138:34.85]Okay, she's coming this way, right?
[138:55.42]So now I can save the game, and I'm gonna surrender in the face.
[138:57.37]Remember, you have a vitamin deficiency.
[139:05.81]I- Okay, Doc.
[139:08.99]I can poison the drip.
[139:09.89]Alright.
[139:23.15]Alright, it's poisoned.
[139:25.44]Here she comes.
[139:25.78]Here she comes.
[139:26.56]Holy shit.
[139:27.96]Okay, I'm actually going to do it.
[139:29.02]Oh, she's here.
[139:37.19]Oh, she's here.
[139:37.81]Why is she not coming in?
[139:38.57]Give me the hammer.
[139:56.93]Oh, we're ready.
[139:57.83]She can come on in.
[140:04.44]Ah.
[140:05.54]Miss Knox.
[140:07.32]Welcome.
[140:09.60]Are you ready for your treatment?
[140:11.92]Come on in.
[140:12.80]You're not the wrong person.
[140:16.12]Hello.
[140:32.47]Hey.
[140:32.65]Don't strangle her now.
[140:42.20]Hey, you want me to test it?
[140:43.62]I would test it first.
[140:45.22]Hey, yo, fucking I would test it.
[140:46.20]Don't fucking get in there.
[140:46.96]I would test it first if I were you.
[140:48.24]Hey, I would test it.
[140:50.20]Miss Knox, we're ready for you.
[140:51.24]Sit right there.
[140:52.30]Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Folate.
[140:54.33]Vitamin D3.
[141:17.69]Doctor?
[141:17.93]Doctor?
[141:18.07]Doctor?
[141:19.13]Wait, did I say there was poison in it?
[141:20.75]I am.
[141:21.21]You're gonna be having a good time too, real soon.
[142:01.35]What?
[142:01.75]You're still alive?
[142:09.87]Isn't the poison gonna kill her?
[142:13.74]The poison should have worked by now.
[142:15.18]Oh, what?
[142:19.24]Let me try that brew.
[142:20.74]I did it!
[142:32.21]Why is everything locked?
[142:45.36]I punched a bald spot into his head!
[142:48.92]What?
[142:50.64]I punched him so bad he went bald in the place that I hit him?
[142:53.80]Are you serious?
[142:56.62]No fucking way!
[142:58.03]What?
[142:58.55]Alright, I'm out.
[143:02.14]Hooray!
[143:11.44]I completed a mission in Hitman VR.
[143:13.46]It actually happened.
[143:25.85]Very cool.
[143:32.85]Do the concrete dance party next.
[143:34.93]Alright, I'll do that one for like five minutes.
[143:36.95]52 minutes.
[143:40.11]That was like three hours.
[143:41.21]Okay.
[143:52.12]I don't want to do... What are you doing?
[143:54.42]Next up.
[143:54.88]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[143:56.32]Menu.
[144:00.98]What's the concrete level called?
[144:15.41]Where is it?
[144:17.23]Berlin, right?
[144:18.87]Yep.
[144:27.68]Oh, wait.
[144:27.94]I can actually go to the dance party.
[144:44.06]You can slap people?
[144:45.98]Oh, wait, turn it on casual.
[144:48.46]Yeah, right.
[144:49.22]I'm gonna pick my nose.
[144:50.12]I don't care.
[144:56.34]On VR, you have to play on casual.
[144:57.67]It's impossible.
[145:06.53]I keep biting my lip.
[145:08.89]You're the worst gamer?
[145:09.81]That's fine.
[145:18.74]Oh, that's right.
[145:19.50]I forgot about this mission.
[145:20.44]You have to meet that lady, right?
[145:27.00]Biting your lip is worse than picking your nose.
[145:28.54]I bite my lip all the time.
[145:29.46]I can't help it.
[145:30.34]I should really put some chapstick on, though.
[145:36.45]Yeah, isn't she back here?
[145:49.85]I can't have a goat.
[145:55.01]Hello, yes, where are you?
[145:56.17]I know you're here somewhere.
[146:01.31]Where are you?
[146:03.43]There you are.
[146:03.73]Alright, stop biting your lip.
[146:07.71]Enough.
[146:09.91]Stop it.
[146:10.39]Enough.
[146:16.18]what happened here no no she what happened this is her car she must have gone down this way she had to have oh no my god
[146:48.93]This actually is kind of cool in VR, this part.
[146:50.41]It's kind of like I'm playing our game.
[146:53.05]All right, here we go.
[147:01.17]Save the game right here.
[147:03.23]I'm not doing that again.
[147:04.17]Bingo.
[147:26.23]I want that knife.
[147:26.83]Alright, let's go to the party.
[147:30.73]Should I disguise?
[147:32.89]No.
[147:33.11]Considering how much you love this series, is the VR version fun to play?
[147:53.13]That depends.
[147:55.24]Wait like two weeks.
[147:58.86]Because it is a fucking mess to get this to run.
[148:03.86]Like I told you, the first hour or two that I tried to play this game, in my headset, it was flipped horizontally and I was reading everything backwards.
[148:12.20]For no reason.
[148:13.11]I've restarted the game like 20 times and it fixed it.
[148:17.27]Wait a couple weeks.
[148:20.11]That being said...
[148:22.91]It's awesome.
[148:23.68]Like, it's really fun to actually do this in VR.
[148:26.68]The controls are kind of sloppy.
[148:29.88]I would wait to make sure the game actually can run on a lot of platforms.
[148:32.38]Because, I mean, I had a... It was a huge pain in the ass, I'll be honest with you.
[148:34.64]Alright, let's get in line.
[148:46.99]Hey.
[148:48.45]Remember this joke?
[148:51.13]I don't wait in line for anybody.
[148:54.05]I'm gonna go ahead of all of you.
[148:57.67]Where am I going?
[149:01.09]I don't have to wait in line.
[149:02.94]I'm gonna cut everybody.
[149:04.32]Remember that joke when I did that a couple years ago?
[149:07.68]Alright, let me in.
[149:08.56]Get out.
[149:10.62]Stay safe, sir.
[149:22.93]I'm ready.
[149:23.55]No weapons.
[149:24.71]I gotta hide this stuff.
[149:26.61]I'm not... It's not my turn yet.
[149:27.66]Oh, remember this guy.
[149:28.82]This is the drugs guy.
[149:30.66]No.
[149:50.53]No, don't care.
[149:52.85]No, I don't care.
[149:54.63]Shut up.
[150:04.31]What else do I have?
[150:05.47]I can bring a camera in there.
[150:06.27]Alright, I'm ready.
[150:15.62]Just kill the bouncer.
[150:20.37]Alright, am I even in frame?
[150:22.00]Kind of.
[150:22.28]Here we go.
[150:33.40]You can pat me down, I've got nothing on me.
[150:36.60]Man, I'm ready to party!
[150:37.72]Thank you.
[150:38.22]What do you mean?
[150:39.10]Can you believe this, Jerry?
[150:50.92]I'm with him.
[150:52.12]Him and I are... We're together.
[150:53.24]We're coming in.
[150:54.30]Careful now, my friend.
[150:56.28]You and I are hanging together.
[150:57.50]Hanging out.
[150:57.82]We're friends.
[150:59.22]So, we're just gonna be let in.
[151:00.48]And together we'll go in there and I'll buy... You know, I'm really... I'll buy you like a bunch of... Like all the drinks you can drink tonight.
[151:07.33]I'm loaded.
[151:09.39]Whatever.
[151:09.71]Fuck you.
[151:13.89]Hey!
[151:14.58]About that bike.
[151:15.52]I forgot.
[151:16.16]I'll help you.
[151:19.94]Where is it?
[151:24.06]You looking for your bike?
[151:24.96]I can help you.
[151:26.06]How do I help him?
[151:29.12]Kill someone, please.
[151:30.36]Let me get inside!
[151:33.88]I'm trying to help this guy find his bike.
[151:35.47]Where's the bike?
[151:37.37]It's over here, isn't it?
[151:46.01]What?
[151:48.94]Where's the... Oh, there it is.
[151:57.30]Hey, I got the pills.
[151:59.53]Oh, what's a- Oh my god, is it a knife?
[152:01.29]A gun?
[152:02.05]I can't believe what's going on in the world at this point.
[152:09.37]Is this legal?
[152:09.87]Let me in.
[152:10.37]Should I take some?
[152:11.33]Where are they?
[152:12.29]I'll take them.
[152:40.47]I mean, it's probably dusty in there.
[152:43.41]I don't blame you for taking those.
[152:47.27]Hey, I should be on the list.
[152:49.08]The name is Helfried Ziegler.
[152:51.50]And this gentleman is my... Remember me?
[152:54.06]Yeah.
[152:54.78]You look cool.
[152:56.20]Come inside.
[152:57.00]Yeah.
[152:57.40]Remember me?
[152:57.96]Yeah.
[153:02.24]Said free drinks all night.
[153:06.23]He's going to get in somehow.
[153:07.37]Didn't want to fucking help me.
[153:09.69]You have to put this sticker on your phone.
[153:13.59]No photos allowed.
[153:15.55]Even when you're on the guest list.
[153:17.97]If you want to pass, you need to comply to a frisk, sir.
[153:20.95]Go for it.
[153:22.89]Just a No, I was going to pay for that guy's drinks all night.
[153:31.32]Two of them.
[153:32.92]At least two.
[153:33.48]Don't touch me.
[153:36.43]I was gonna buy that guy two drinks!
[153:37.69]Oh, trash!
[153:38.13]What's in there?
[153:38.93]Anything good?
[153:39.71]The juice bar?
[153:40.51]Okay, cool.
[153:41.43]You have a lot of allergies.
[154:07.22]No, they have shots that you can take.
[154:08.28]You have to take them, like, for six months.
[154:10.46]It's a pain in the ass, but you should feel better.
[154:11.75]It gets your body used to, like, the built up, like, the, uh, uh, inflammatory response that your body has.
[154:17.97]Alright, let's go.
[154:24.31]Come on, give me that one.
[154:25.01]That one's a plus two.
[154:30.12]Okay.
[154:35.85]This feels like weird being in first person.
[154:39.51]Oh shit.
[154:42.64]I always throw this guy off and I'm doing it in VR.
[154:46.94]You better believe it.
[154:48.97]I throw that guy over every time.
[155:26.53]Have you had the juice yet?
[155:27.43]Because I had a lot.
[155:28.51]You have to press A?
[155:51.00]I thought I could just like shove him.
[155:55.67]It's so loud, I can't even hear anything else.
[155:57.51]All right, let's do it.
[156:03.79]It's Chris Redfield.
[156:21.81]I didn't even touch him!
[156:22.79]I didn't even touch him!
[156:25.27]You were standing right next to me, I didn't even touch him!
[156:27.81]I didn't even touch him!
[156:31.35]That guy just jumped off!
[156:33.49]I didn't... I actually didn't even touch him.
[156:40.24]He just, like, fucking, like, dolphin-ed over.
[156:43.96]Okay, no more fucking around, I'm going to the dance floor.
[157:12.87]I'm sorry.
[157:20.97]I won't do it again.
[157:21.73]I promise I won't do it again.
[157:23.22]I'm so sorry.
[157:24.10]Jeez.
[157:26.24]I promise I won't do that again.
[157:28.18]I have to get out of my... When somebody's standing at an edge like that, they have to go over.
[157:31.76]You know it.
[157:32.88]I know it.
[157:34.62]I wanted to see how far I could get.
[157:35.88]Okay, I'm not doing that again.
[157:36.66]I promise.
[157:36.96]I'm out.
[157:37.22]I'm out.
[157:37.40]I'm out.
[157:37.56]I'm done.
[157:37.87]I'm done.
[157:38.17]I'm done.
[157:46.54]Can I get some juice?
[157:52.69]Alright.
[157:55.51]I feel like I'm in the metaverse right now.
[157:58.89]You know what I mean?
[158:00.51]Like, this is what it's going to be like.
[158:05.08]Like, just as fucking weird and awkward as it is in real life.
[158:09.98]Oh, cool.
[158:11.70]Hey, what's up?
[158:14.78]I don't like this.
[158:15.54]I don't want to do this.
[158:17.92]What?
[158:24.36]How's everybody doing?
[158:26.42]Stop looking at me.
[158:27.42]Don't point at me.
[158:30.04]Oh, gross.
[158:33.86]Gross.
[158:49.28]Cinnamon sticks?
[158:56.18]How much are the cinnamon sticks, dude?
[158:59.26]Thank you.
[159:00.06]Can I get some of that juice?
[159:06.99]I'll take one juice, please.
[159:13.57]What?
[159:14.29]What?
[159:16.45]Hey, I got a space bubble.
[159:19.56]You came into my space, bro.
[159:22.88]Really?
[159:24.08]Really?
[159:24.36]You know there's a line, right?
[159:25.80]You know there's a fucking line.
[159:27.28]You know there's a fucking line!
[159:28.40]You know there's a fucking line, bro!
[159:30.92]Back up!
[159:33.58]Come up here and shove me.
[159:42.57]He came up and started pushing me.
[159:44.83]No, that's fucked up.
[159:45.95]That's fucked up.
[159:46.51]You know what I mean?
[159:46.95]I think...
[159:52.13]He comes up pushing up on me, telling me to get out of his space.
[159:54.61]He literally put his hands on me and punched me in the back of the head.
[160:00.33]I want to try this juice.
[160:01.31]I heard it's good.
[160:05.32]He really did.
[160:07.22]Who is he talking to?
[160:08.96]I'm like RPing as like the drunk asshole.
[160:14.94]Who was it?
[160:16.06]Where was the guy that pushed me?
[160:17.66]It was this guy.
[160:18.58]No, it wasn't.
[160:22.50]Must resist the urge to push him.
[160:25.75]Must resist the urge to push him over the edge.
[160:27.89]I didn't know I could not be over here.
[160:33.13]Alright, where the fuck can I go?
[160:38.57]I'm drinking soda?
[160:40.03]Alright.
[160:40.93]I actually probably would.
[160:42.73]What?
[160:59.54]What?

[161:22.20]I'm just sitting here RPing as a weird, like, a guy at a bar.
[161:25.76]Those guys are actually contracted to kill me.
[161:27.72]I completely forgot about that.
[161:30.85]You have to avoid those guys, right?
[161:38.15]I completely forgot about the people that are hunting you, right?
[161:41.46]Okay.
[161:43.68]That's gonna be so hard.

[176:14.81]Shit.
[176:15.97]What about here?
[176:19.43]All right, this is better.

[176:25.31]There's one person right here.
[176:26.15]All right, close it, get in.
[176:26.99]Okay, I can go this way.
[176:37.85]Turn on the case.
[176:38.71]Alright, hold on, save it here.
[176:40.37]Yeah, definitely save it right here.
[176:44.85]Let's see if I can pull somebody and then take their disguise.
[176:52.73]Somebody coming?
[176:53.17]I wonder where my butthole is.
[176:57.03]When is GermaCraft coming back?
[177:00.21]It's not.
[177:05.46]Somebody coming down?
[177:10.38]Alright, who's investigating it?

[189:39.90]Yeah, this is the one.
[189:48.93]I just want to go to the barbecue.
[189:49.65]Hopefully you just didn't hear that.
[189:51.36]I think you can.
[189:51.78]I just, like, burped really loud in the headset.
[189:54.14]Okay, so... He's in there.
[189:54.92]He's over there.
[189:55.50]Hello, neighbor!
[190:17.73]Am I yelling?
[190:18.63]I feel like it's loud in my head, so I'm talking and yelling louder than normal, I think.
[190:26.43]Am I?
[190:27.21]Fuck.
[190:28.47]I'm talking way louder than usual because it's so loud in my head.
[190:31.45]Very cool.
[190:37.13]Barbecue.
[190:37.69]Birthday party.
[190:38.19]Got intel right here.
[190:45.54]Oh geez, darling, I'm so hungry.
[190:48.17]Have you seen those beautiful patties back there?
[190:52.43]And Mr. Wilson keeps standing behind the grill, even though there's clearly no more gas on it.
[190:57.79]I know.
[190:58.55]It's weird.
[191:00.17]Why doesn't he go grab a new canister?
[191:02.81]I'm telling you, these new folks are strange.
[191:06.35]Did you see that Cassidy guy snooping around here?
[191:09.53]He's been looking at the party three times already.
[191:13.13]Why not just go inside?
[191:14.93]It's open to everyone.
[191:16.33]Yeah, it's strange, all right.
[191:18.99]Let's go.
[191:19.21]Yep.
[191:19.37]Yep.
[191:19.47]Time to be the grill.
[191:20.05]Master of the grill.
[191:20.67]All right.
[191:53.42]Oh my god, I would be like the weird guy.
[192:15.44]I'm sorry.
[192:17.62]My shirt's ripping.
[192:18.96]Is it?
[192:22.48]That's the guy with the grill?
[192:33.25]I was playing the guitar.
[192:34.27]Did it come through the eyes?
[192:35.41]Okay.
[192:38.75]Unlock the door.
[192:39.45]It's right here.
[192:40.11]Really?
[192:45.63]Well, shit.
[192:46.19]Alright, I need the key.
[192:48.18]Probably in the house?
[192:52.02]What is that?
[192:53.42]You got a key?
[192:53.94]I'm doing... You know what?
[192:55.52]You know what?
[192:56.16]People don't fucking ask that anymore.
[192:58.74]Like, how are you doing, right?
[193:01.04]That guy's scary.
[193:01.58]Oh, right, right.
[193:22.13]Why are you a horror movie character?
[193:23.47]Why are you full silhouette?
[193:24.87]I don't get it.
[193:26.45]What?
[193:26.61]I can't take more than one?
[193:29.01]I don't want to come back up here three or four times.
[193:35.62]That burger's way too big.
[193:38.62]Alright.
[193:40.24]Hey, boss!
[193:40.70]How can I help you?
[193:46.15]Yeah, sorry.
[193:46.83]I'm talking very loud still.
[193:50.66]I need a key.
[193:50.96]It's in the house, right?
[193:51.94]It has to be in the house.
[193:53.44]Where is it?
[193:53.74]It's definitely in there.
[193:54.90]It's in the house.
[194:13.03]Thanks a lot.
[194:13.33]Key.
[194:13.41]Key.
[194:13.51]It's definitely over here.
[194:15.57]Is it an ice cream machine?
[194:17.60]Oh, it's just beer.
[194:18.38]Oh, fuck that stuff.
[194:19.12]That would have been so much better if it was a soft serve machine.
[194:37.55]Thank you.
[194:38.50]Uh... Look over... Look over key.
[194:44.76]Look over key.
[194:46.42]Ugh.
[194:46.84]Why do you keep that much marinara?
[194:49.90]Giant ostriches?
[194:50.86]He said orange is wrong!
[194:51.43]And here?
[195:13.80]Where is this key?
[195:14.40]There's got to be a key.
[195:15.10]The key is definitely in the house somewhere, right?
[195:18.60]Have I lost my mind?
[195:22.12]Ooh.
[195:23.01]I'll take that.
[195:31.21]Key.
[195:34.91]There's a wasp in the room.
[195:36.29]There's no wasp in the room.
[195:38.07]Guys, it's January in Las Vegas.
[195:41.81]There are no wasps right now.
[195:45.11]It's like 40 degrees outside.
[195:46.51]Like 30 degrees.
[195:47.23]Can I go back here?
[195:51.33]No.
[195:57.03]Hmm.
[195:58.71]How do I get the key to get over there?
[196:00.99]Maybe all the way around.
[196:01.61]It actually kind of is.
[196:11.45]All the way around?
[196:14.99]Okay, all the way around.
[196:16.13]If I go... Can I go in this person's yard?
[196:17.41]I can.
[196:23.19]All right, good.
[196:24.63]There we go.
[196:26.25]Grass passing.
[196:27.37]That's okay.
[196:27.73]I used to go like this.
[196:33.61]You see what I mean, right?
[196:45.09]Oh, fuck off.
[196:47.91]Honest to God, how do I get- I just punched through it.
[196:50.55]No, I don't care.
[197:01.87]I'm the grill master.
[197:14.26]How could- has everybody got their doors unlocked?
[197:17.17]Everybody has their locked doors?
[197:23.07]You can vault the fence?
[197:26.92]No, you can't.
[197:37.54]Jeez.
[197:40.70]Aye, aye, aye.
[197:41.78]Okay.
[197:42.30]Well, that wasted, like, ten straight minutes for no reason.
[197:52.12]Alright.
[198:00.44]Okay.
[198:02.10]Over here?
[198:02.42]Where the hell is this?
[198:05.89]Over here.
[198:10.13]Oh, shit.
[198:11.11]I'm not supposed to be here.
[198:12.39]Wait a minute.
[198:52.93]I didn't see... How did you see me?
[198:55.73]You didn't see me.
[198:56.45]Duck, duck, duck, duck.
[199:12.21]I didn't save the game either, whatever.
[199:41.71]I didn't even save the game anywhere.
[199:43.95]Shit.
[199:44.41]Okay, well, at least I know what to do.
[199:46.62]Just go hop the fence and then go... I thought I could... I didn't know they could see through the bush.
[199:53.88]Is this ants in your room?
[199:55.59]That's all right.
[199:56.47]They help me.
[199:58.97]I... I'm... I'm... I gotta stop.
[200:02.16]My body hurts.
[200:03.94]Stopping in ten minutes.
[200:05.37]This is too much fun, though.
[200:07.35]I'm having too much fun.
[200:08.31]Yeah, the ants help.
[200:08.81]I've trained them.
[200:09.35]Okay.
[200:27.75]These ants, like, they brush my teeth.
[200:29.27]They go around the toothbrush, like, 5,000 of them.
[200:31.33]They pick it up.
[200:31.79]They come all the way up my leg, all the way up to my chin.
[200:34.25]I open my mouth like this, and they... Alright, climb.
[200:42.30]Let's do this shit again.
[201:01.29]Oh shit.
[201:06.29]Wait, hold on.
[201:07.59]Hold on a second.
[201:09.03]Very important.
[201:28.88]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[201:29.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[201:32.92]Why would just... I can't hit it.
[201:45.87]Whatever.
[201:47.61]Wait, there's one right here.
[201:48.25]Hey.
[201:50.51]Wait a minute.
[201:51.21]I think you dropped that.
[201:56.33]Yeah, I dropped a golf club.
[201:57.59]Relax, it's a party.
[201:58.51]Nice!
[201:58.75]I got it.
[201:59.13]Say what?
[202:28.52]Oh, there's the grill master.
[202:41.88]No, I can't.
[202:43.64]I can't do it.
[202:45.20]I can't do it.
[202:45.88]I can't do it.
[202:46.54]I'm going to do it.
[202:51.52]You are such a fool.
[202:54.60]How could you forget the class?
[202:56.84]All you had to do was remember the gash, flip some barbers in your shoes, and... What?
[203:09.77]What's going on here?
[203:10.63]Shit.
[203:11.89]Command, please...
[203:18.21]I didn't save it.
[203:18.81]Alright, I'm done.
[203:19.69]I'm exhausted.
[203:22.41]I'm exhausted.
[203:23.03]I'm too tired.
[203:45.94]Alright, one last, just, I'm just gonna have one last dickhead run and I'm done.
[203:55.06]This is the last, just, shithead run and I'm done.
[204:00.76]I wish my body was just such a piece of shit, I would keep playing.
[204:03.66]Okay, alright.
[204:14.08]47, I've marked your map with several points of interest.
[204:18.01]We're running this mission with very little upfront intel, but these locations could provide clues to help you obtain the information we need.
[204:25.80]Good luck.
[204:29.06]Blake, is he that guy who tried to ban maple syrup lollipops?
[204:33.06]Oh, hello there.
[204:33.86]How are you?
[204:34.69]If he did, I'm sure there was a very good reason.
[204:36.95]I'm running for election in the next election.
[204:38.81]I don't believe we've met, Mr... I'm not from around here.
[204:41.75]Agent 47.
[204:41.95]I don't much care for politics.
[204:47.36]Yeah, now I am.
[204:48.98]Not only did you try to ban the maple syrup lollipops, you tried to cancel Halloween and added about 15 new rules to the local town plan in an effort to try to make everything look the same or violating the big chunk of land around Whittleton Creek.
[205:02.77]You're, uh, you're not from around here.
[205:05.57]No, I, uh, what does that have to do with anything?
[205:08.19]Friendly piece of advice, fella.
[205:09.73]Your boss, Blake III, he's probably the most unpopular guy in all of the counties.
[205:14.20]In the ten years he's been chairman, he's bound the municipality in so much red tape.
[205:18.10]We can't even see City Hall anymore.
[205:19.72]I like your honesty.
[205:20.44]If we vote him into higher office, what do you think will happen?
[205:23.06]I don't care about politics either.
[205:24.86]Neither do I. A better world.
[205:26.88]Have a nice day.
[205:28.28]Put it there.
[205:29.12]Good luck, pal.
[205:30.50]You'll need it.
[205:31.00]No, I'm not going to punch him.
[205:32.32]Charles Blake III appreciates your support.
[205:36.98]What do you stand for in the issues?
[205:40.94]Easy, man.
[205:43.08]What do you stand for on the issues?
[205:44.28]What is that?
[205:44.58]Oh, I thought that was like a thing on his phone.
[205:47.33]That's his fingers coming through.
[205:51.01]I just kind of like walking around.
[205:51.71]It's fun.
[206:06.85]I gotta get this right.
[206:37.91]Who should I, uh, Gardner or... What?
[206:45.34]Who?
[206:46.20]Fuck.
[206:50.98]I didn't even see these.
[206:51.90]How come they didn't see that happen?
[206:53.48]I'm, I'm toast.
[207:03.13]I'm toast.
[207:03.49]I'm toast.
[207:03.87]All the signs of adult attention deficit disorder.
[207:06.43]Hey, whoa.
[207:07.41]Okay.
[207:09.28]I mean, that's true.
[207:10.80]You've obviously been watching the stream.
[207:12.20]Well, that's not the best way to get a woman's attention, you know?
[207:14.90]Hey, what in God's name do you think you're doing?
[207:17.92]I'm going to punch you now.
[207:20.70]Freeze right there.
[207:21.80]Let me see your hands.
[207:25.16]Hands behind your head, big boy.
[207:26.68]What are you waiting for?
[207:35.67]I'm trying to get you to shoot.
[207:37.65]I'm done.
[207:38.97]I'm too tired.
[207:42.63]I don't think I can go on.
[207:49.11]ATD.
[207:52.27]Oh, man.

[209:26.49]Just keep an eye on the stuff.
[209:27.19]It's going to be in the next few days.
[209:32.55]Myriad stirs D&D-esque kind of campaign.
[209:36.67]So, it'll be a lot of fun.
[209:41.99]Also, keep an eye on the channel on February 1st.
[209:44.18]That's the big stream.
[209:45.14]Don't miss it.
[209:46.20]Well, you can if you need to, but don't.
[209:49.56]But you can.
[209:50.00]All right.
[209:54.71]Jeremy, you're an NPC?
[209:56.39]What?
[210:01.63]Well, you don't know anything.
[210:03.69]You don't know what I am or not in the game.
[210:06.19]I could be, I don't know.
[210:07.01]All right, I'll do a hair check, and then I'm going to take off.
[210:13.67]Sorry there was so much technical bullshit, especially halfway through, and I was supposed to start way before 4 o'clock, but I'm spent.
[210:22.86]I knew these were only going to be a couple hours each.
[210:25.56]But I'll see you guys on Sunday for more VR.
[210:28.38]Not necessarily Hitman, by the way.
[210:35.02]I really want to keep playing, but I just can't.
[210:37.36]It sucks.
[210:41.84]I really want to stay.
[210:47.08]It's all right.
[210:53.06]Yep.
[210:55.02]Last time I did VR and I did this in streams more than three or four plus hours, five hours, it was a big mistake.
[211:01.28]So I'll take it easy.
[211:03.58]And I'll be back on Sunday.
[211:05.81]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[211:06.61]We will see you soon.
[211:07.91]If you're back with us again.
[211:15.88]You gonna do Among Us VR?
[211:18.92]It'll probably be a lot better if they patch it.
[211:20.58]Yeah, that's what some people said.
[211:22.46]Do you recommend the game?
[211:25.28]I mean, yes, but probably not now.
[211:29.41]If you're buying Hitman for VR right now, if you're just like, I want it on Steam for PSVR, not for, for Index or Vive, whatever, give them a few weeks maybe.
[211:40.15]Let them patch it, because they probably will.
[211:42.75]There's a shitload of things that are kind of weird and wonky with it.
[211:47.45]And I'm going to go drink some water and get some food.
[211:50.21]I had a lot of fun.
[211:51.03]That was a ton of fun, as it always is.
[211:54.89]VR sucks.
[212:01.19]I'll see you sunday I'll see you saturday if you're gonna watch uh the myriad so we need a hair check fine I'll give you I'll give you a disgusting image after the credits there's a lot more too I have way more vr games
[212:29.02]Because six months ago, when I did this last time, or seven months ago, it was a lot of stuff that we didn't play that I still have.
[212:36.66]So there's a lot to do.
[212:42.03]Yeah, mark February 1st on your calendar.
[212:44.93]It's going to be a wild one.
[212:47.55]Special guests.
[212:49.83]And what is the stream?
[212:52.07]You're going to have to find out.
[212:54.34]You're going to have to watch it.
