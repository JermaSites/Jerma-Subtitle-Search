[00:03.19]I'm changing the title.
[00:03.93]Alright, let's play Dusk.
[00:05.87]I got it right here.
[00:13.61]Go back to Sniper.
[00:14.91]Get out of here.
[00:16.79]It was an interesting idea.
[00:19.43]I would just would have liked to go to other games.
[00:21.87]The other levels.
[00:22.79]Instead of just playing on the same one for like one to two straight hours.
[00:25.37]Alright, Dusk.
[00:27.77]Incoming.
[00:36.27]Uh, why can I not capture it?
[00:38.61]There it is.
[00:43.84]Loading tunes.
[00:44.80]This may take a while.
[00:46.96]Headphones recommended.
[00:48.46]I got them in.
[00:58.57]Alright, why is this taking a while?

[01:23.79]V-sync off.
[01:24.85]Weapon size.
[01:25.97]Drop that a little bit.
[01:27.09]I don't like having huge-ass weapons on the screen.
[01:28.78]I'm actually... That's really cool about that.
[01:30.66]120 is my frame rate.
[01:32.14]Field of view.

[04:57.67]What is intruder mode?
[05:01.55]I can take it.
[05:14.96]Turn off the filtering.

[05:17.58]Should I not have it on?
[05:20.43]Let's see.
[05:21.33]I'll give it a minute.
[05:22.49]Do I have a gun?
[05:49.82]This was moving really fast, kinda hurts my head.
[05:58.06]Press F for flashlight, F. E, interact, lift box.
[06:10.74]Oops, wait, is it gone, no?
[06:12.01]What is that?

[06:28.05]Wait, I can customize this.
[06:29.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:30.48]Go back to normal.
[06:32.02]Okay, hold on.
[06:34.28]Turn off the filtering.
[06:36.84]Oh, that actually does look kind of like bad.
[06:39.28]Alright.
[06:40.08]Wait a minute.
[06:41.96]Brightness up.
[06:44.98]Saturation down a little.
[06:46.50]Contrast down.
[06:48.55]Brightness up.
[06:50.27]Hue.
[06:51.45]That's okay.
[06:52.07]Maybe a little bit more brightness.
[06:53.67]Like right here.
[06:56.02]Drop the saturation.
[06:58.38]And drop the contrast.
[06:59.22]I think that's okay for me.
[07:05.03]No.
[07:16.80]Alright, how much would I have for health?
[07:19.50]174?
[07:19.52]Alright, let's go.
[07:21.50]How do I get a weapon?
[07:23.76]The fuck?
[07:24.28]How do you get a weapon?
[07:27.51]I can block those?
[07:37.87]What's this?
[07:38.39]Ooh, pistol, okay.
[07:39.79]How do I aim?
[07:41.75]Ooh, alright, nice.
[07:45.21]How much, I get 56 bullets?
[07:50.28]Does it reload or does it just, you have 56 shots?
[08:03.71]Something below is calling us.
[08:05.85]Is it headshots in this game?
[08:23.63]No?
[08:26.87]What the fuck?
[08:27.44]Flick?
[08:29.50]Oh, shit.
[08:31.22]I'm surprised I found that so quickly.
[08:32.76]Alright, hold on.
[08:33.22]What's up here?
[08:48.19]Ooh, shotgun.
[08:53.25]Oh, shit!
[08:55.05]This is loud as hell.
[08:56.77]This is very loud.
[08:57.37]Hold on.
[09:04.86]Toilet?
[09:05.44]Flush toilet.
[09:06.74]Secret.
[09:10.74]Sacrifice.
[09:15.66]Lift barrel.
[09:16.18]Oh, they exploded.
[09:25.71]I have a lot of shotgun shots.
[09:26.61]This is a missed secret.
[09:28.03]Get the secret room.
[09:29.03]I...
[09:31.47]Get the secret.
[09:32.83]The first time I've ever even played this video game.
[09:35.51]Go get secret.
[09:39.73]I can't even go back, guys.
[09:43.86]In the game where you sprint 100 miles per hour and enemies are all over the place.
[09:47.84]Why didn't you get the secret room?
[10:01.77]There, you can all calm down now.
[10:03.21]Everybody can hold the... Everybody can relax.
[10:06.43]Which way?
[10:17.65]I should probably hold this.
[10:23.68]Yeah, I'm gonna hold on to that.
[10:27.38]More... Double shotgun?
[10:28.82]Okay, that's cool.
[10:31.20]What do I just do?
[10:34.16]Did I open, like, another door or something?
[10:35.30]I don't know.
[10:35.56]Let's go this way.
[10:37.66]I could go up.
[10:44.84]Click both switches?
[10:45.76]No.
[10:46.74]Let's just go back up.
[10:47.44]There's something up here.
[10:55.76]Double pistol now.
[11:00.36]Should I break every barrel?
[11:07.66]Alright, I'm good.
[11:08.32]Cool.
[11:09.14]I got the secret.
[11:13.36]Let's move.
[11:25.49]Uh, wait, that is the right way, isn't it?
[11:28.41]Yeah.
[11:30.19]Press E on beer.
[11:33.23]How about I sneeze first?
[11:41.70]Uh... Do I have to go back in this house?
[11:59.35]Maybe we'll go this way.
[12:02.29]Is there a door?
[12:27.25]Did I miss something back here?
[12:31.18]I guess I did.
[12:31.68]Crouch while moving to slide.
[12:36.54]Cool.
[12:38.54]Oh.
[12:47.46]Total kills, 24.
[12:47.98]Secrets, 1 out of 6.
[12:49.68]Only 1 out of 6.
[12:51.44]I can't believe this imbecile can't even get 2 secrets!
[12:58.66]Prepare thyself for Zinniki to enter the horror.
[13:02.04]Down on the farm!
[13:03.38]Let's move.
[13:16.29]What do I have?
[13:16.71]A super move?
[13:19.93]Alright, cool.
[13:27.12]What do we got?
[13:32.12]I almost had a bullet.
[13:37.87]Bad guy?
[13:38.37]That's an enemy, right?
[13:41.83]Shit.
[13:42.21]Got hurt.
[13:42.61]That's the first time I've been hit in the whole game.
[13:45.35]Gas can.
[13:53.80]You're wasting bullets.
[13:59.34]Post, no trespassing.
[14:10.59]Use more sickle, but...
[14:18.87]3 million bullets in this gun.
[14:20.11]I'm fine.
[14:32.79]Gas can.
[14:40.46]Ooh, another shotgun.
[14:42.12]Oh, fuck.
[14:45.28]Just jumped the whole thing.
[14:47.90]Alright, I got money.
[14:51.45]Don't go up there.
[14:53.11]Manga S, don't go up there.
[15:03.57]Don't do it.
[15:04.13]Don't do it!
[15:05.13]Alright, here's the plan.
[15:06.27]I'm going to throw this right into the window up here.
[15:10.08]Well, I missed.
[15:10.56]Can I go in?
[15:17.73]What is that up there?
[15:18.33]A carrot?
[15:19.39]I gotta get that.
[15:23.57]Whoa!
[15:24.01]Is it baseball bat?
[15:38.97]Drink?
[15:39.65]Whoa!
[15:47.60]Alright, there's health everywhere, though.
[15:53.86]I just went to bed?
[16:00.16]Fuck!
[16:01.30]I thought there was probably something in there.
[16:06.80]Whatever.
[16:11.63]I'm scared to go in here.
[16:25.64]Is this poisonous?
[16:31.04]A gold coin.
[16:32.37]What does morale do?
[16:40.13]It's armor.
[16:40.81]Oh, okay.
[16:41.15]Cool.
[16:43.25]Did I get everything in here?
[16:44.01]I think I did.
[16:44.77]I want to go out the window, though, and jump.
[17:01.50]Alright, cool.
[17:03.58]I guess I'm just going to keep going.
[17:04.50]I want to get out that window, though.
[17:06.24]How do I get up there?
[17:10.48]I don't think I can.
[17:15.70]Can I not get up there?
[17:21.32]Oh, this thing doesn't hurt you.
[17:24.78]I thought that thing hurt you.
[17:29.75]Diamond.
[17:30.75]There we go.
[17:31.21]Now I'm going to get from here over there.
[17:34.23]Okay, cool.
[17:36.09]Now, let's go.
[17:42.50]Sinner.
[17:46.84]Wait.
[17:53.42]Nothing else.
[17:53.82]Let's move.
[17:54.78]Okay.
[18:01.23]Make sure I'm loaded.
[18:09.67]Oh!
[18:10.03]I didn't know you were there.
[18:10.71]I knew it!
[18:19.92]I knew it!
[18:20.26]I knew it!
[18:24.52]I knew it was gonna happen.
[18:25.54]Fuck, that was actually kind of scary.
[18:33.87]I need the red key to open this?
[18:37.21]Oh, that sucks.
[18:43.78]Oh, the music's getting higher.
[19:07.95]That's a lot of people.
[19:09.29]Nice strafing.
[19:15.67]Thanks, dude.
[19:23.62]What's that?
[19:37.13]Oh, you found the Hallowed Health.
[19:38.47]166!
[19:38.49]I'm a strife master, goddammit.
[20:08.41]Holy shit!
[20:13.00]Does distance matter?
[20:13.86]Does it matter how far away I am?
[20:20.98]Will I do more damage if I'm closer or... Hammer.
[20:27.13]Yes, okay.
[20:27.87]I just want to make sure.
[20:28.75]Some video games like this don't matter.
[20:30.77]What does this do?
[20:32.67]Secret door opened.
[20:36.17]Secret door opened?
[20:40.71]Where?
[20:51.11]Somewhere else, okay.
[20:52.71]Oh, I got the key.
[21:00.78]Is this like experience or something?
[21:03.26]Magic.
[21:03.58]Oh, it's a health increase.
[21:05.46]I see.
[21:11.63]I'm gonna get spawned on or something, aren't I?
[21:14.19]What about the secret door?
[21:17.42]Alright, let me go back here.
[21:18.22]Is there a secret door?
[21:32.10]Not really.
[21:34.50]In the house?
[21:40.78]I don't see a door here.
[21:46.74]Can I not pick- what is- okay, what are those?
[21:53.02]Why can't I pick that up?
[22:01.15]Full already.
[22:01.87]What's the secret?
[22:09.93]Oh, you can't have over 100 morale.
[22:11.11]Okay, cool.
[22:12.67]Um, what about back here?
[22:13.77]I guess it wouldn't be a secret if it just... you knew where it was.
[22:21.10]Can I get on the building?
[22:25.86]No.
[22:34.96]Secret?
[22:38.20]No.
[22:41.38]Secret?
[22:45.17]Secret?
[23:02.04]Shoot this?
[23:05.26]Wait.
[23:06.00]That look- That does look like a door.
[23:10.79]Secret!
[23:11.83]That's not the right secret.
[23:17.85]That's not a door.
[23:20.51]This is pretty cool, though.
[23:23.97]I'm just gonna go.
[23:25.27]I could find it another time.
[23:31.89]Wait, let's... Hold on.
[23:33.17]If I jump, can I see where I'm going?
[23:38.00]Hold on.
[23:38.90]What about over here?
[23:42.69]There's like a shed over there.
[23:43.99]No, I've already been there.
[23:45.55]Alright, well, forget it.
[23:46.77]Wait.
[23:53.74]I missed.
[24:04.06]I'm so paranoid about losing secrets.
[24:05.44]Oh, whatever.
[24:09.26]Let's go.
[24:19.99]Do it!
[24:20.49]I know you're gonna do it.
[24:21.37]Do it!
[24:39.43]Cool, what else we got?
[24:50.83]One enemy left.
[24:51.60]I wonder who it was.
[25:00.84]One out of six.
[25:01.83]Yeah.
[25:03.29]Yeah.
[25:04.71]Old time religion.
[25:08.57]This way.
[25:14.75]I'm gonna save the shotgun.
[25:15.45]I have tons.
[25:15.91]I'm using too many shotguns.
[25:17.26]It's too easy to use the shotgun.
[25:19.50]Secret.
[25:20.80]He found the yellow key.
[25:21.86]Secret key.
[25:31.10]Yep.
[25:39.81]There's gonna be a way down in one of these.
[25:46.92]What's that, Minecraft?
[26:00.07]102, I thought I couldn't go over a 1-0.
[26:07.69]Buried with his favorite video game.
[26:12.17]Weird, look at- this is a secret, I'm gonna be- okay, remember that building.
[26:31.37]Do you get more points for killing them with a melee?
[26:38.30]Blue?
[26:38.56]Alright, I need a yellow key.
[26:44.10]I hear something.
[26:45.26]Alright, there's chainsaw guys over here.
[26:46.54]Alright, well, they've lulled me up with shotguns, so let's go.
[27:09.62]Take the book and bring it somewhere.
[27:12.70]I don't know.
[27:14.00]It's probably a secret with that.
[27:35.53]I'm going to put this back on a podium or something, right?
[27:39.88]This is kind of a long fall.
[27:58.89]Throw the Bible.
[28:05.49]Loot.
[28:08.32]There's no loot.
[28:09.34]Lift these.
[28:09.90]Alright, what do we got behind this door?
[28:18.49]That's a new weapon.
[28:36.31]Whew!
[28:41.56]Machine gun.
[28:42.40]Pretty good.
[28:43.61]Not bad.
[28:45.63]I hear people walking.
[28:46.43]Oh my god, shotguns.
[29:08.01]Nothing over here.
[29:08.71]No secrets?
[29:09.41]Fuck.
[29:21.27]Took a lot of hits there that I didn't want to take.
[29:25.31]Okay, red key.
[29:26.31]Loot.
[29:26.59]Just health.
[29:28.81]I already have plenty of health.
[29:36.63]Alright, red key.
[29:37.47]Blue key.
[29:43.92]Jump while sprinting.
[29:46.44]I'm not smart enough to bunny hop.
[29:47.86]It's been proven time and time again.
[29:53.22]What just happened?
[29:56.32]Plus, when I bunny hop it, I go too fast and my brain is like a full second behind.
[30:01.31]So I can't play as good.
[30:18.36]Hurry up.
[30:20.00]What was that?
[30:28.00]Yeah, if I bunny hop, if I go like insanely fast, I can't even process the images on the screen.
[30:32.01]Alright, I got yellow.
[30:47.75]That the yellow key is for the... No, I have the red... Do I have the red key now?
[30:58.14]What the fuck is going on?
[31:01.66]Alright.
[31:14.13]That was kind of fucked up.
[31:15.43]Alright, let's go.
[31:17.00]Where is he, where is he, where is he?
[31:19.52]Which way?
[31:20.00]Let's go this way.
[31:29.41]Not like it matters.
[31:37.13]Get me back down!
[31:37.65]Put me back down!
[31:38.17]Put me back down!
[31:40.25]No!
[31:40.45]Put me back down!
[31:41.35]Okay.
[31:57.46]Ugh, that hurt my head.
[32:00.68]Anything in here that I need?
[32:07.19]Now I have blue.
[32:10.95]Yellow, blue, and red.
[32:12.07]Wish there was another door over here, wouldn't there?
[32:33.22]Move!
[32:34.41]Health!
[32:34.85]Good!
[32:35.43]Did we just go down again?
[32:36.65]Get that morale.
[32:47.16]Didn't I do this already?
[32:49.39]Wait, I already did this.
[33:06.45]You got the key.
[33:07.35]Oh.
[33:11.12]That's true.
[33:12.24]We tried God for... We traded God for demons.
[33:35.17]The scourges of olden times.
[33:42.84]Anything under the bridge?
[33:44.58]Yup.
[33:46.50]Coins?
[34:05.35]Okay.
[34:10.22]Take him out.
[34:17.76]Uh-oh.
[34:20.46]Where is he?
[34:22.00]Ooh!
[34:22.22]God Keep.
[34:25.70]Hallowed Health.
[34:27.98]And a Super Morale.
[34:34.30]Blessed RNG?
[34:35.04]What do you mean, blessed RNG?
[34:37.50]I only have two shots left in the shotgun.
[34:39.30]Not good.
[34:40.14]And I'm going to use the pistols for a little bit.
[34:47.78]That's a boss.
[34:55.43]What did that do?
[34:56.33]Press a button.
[35:45.20]Cool.
[35:45.62]This boss is in this game.
[35:50.12]Quoth.
[35:51.08]Quoth.
[35:52.02]Uh-oh.
[35:53.85]You can actually... You get drunk?
[35:55.23]What does intoxicated do?
[35:57.03]Besides hurt my head.
[36:11.86]Alright, I'm good.
[36:13.96]Alright, that's good.
[36:14.64]I don't think I got any secrets.
[36:23.87]Bump up the difficulty.
[36:25.73]I think it's in a good spot.
[36:27.76]Come on, I can take it.
[36:41.14]Can you, though?
[36:41.84]I mean, we'll find out.
[36:45.94]What the fuck?
[36:51.05]I just took so much damage for no reason.
[36:56.17]You're destroying on this difficulty so far.
[37:00.47]Uh, what do you think?
[37:01.09]I should buff it up?
[37:03.55]One more?
[37:04.53]Am I doing too well?
[37:16.00]You haven't died yet.
[37:18.64]So?
[37:24.27]You sound like that's some kind of bad thing.
[37:30.37]Um, can I even change the difficulty here?
[37:32.57]I can't.
[37:34.53]No.
[37:35.47]Sorry, guys.
[37:36.01]I'm on, like, just the standard...
[37:45.43]Why is the soap so good?
[37:55.39]Just save ammo.
[37:55.99]Ooh, is that a rifle?
[38:08.22]I like the look of that thing.
[38:21.90]You got a super shotgun?
[38:23.50]Ooh, double barrel.
[38:24.60]Nice.
[38:29.80]That's pretty cool.
[38:30.64]Alright.
[38:31.24]Got the yellow key here.
[38:37.01]Okay.
[38:44.27]You're doing too well.
[38:45.65]Am I doing too well?
[38:53.41]I don't think I... You need one more difficulty and it'll be perfect.
[39:00.28]Really.
[39:01.34]You think so?
[39:05.64]We want you to rage.
[39:09.99]Is that what you want?
[39:10.97]You want me to put it on the...
[39:30.68]What's that?
[39:31.02]I don't know, but give me this.
[39:36.40]I'm not going to do the hardest difficulty.
[39:46.17]That's the first time I'm going to be playing.
[39:48.35]I need to just see where I'm at.
[39:51.45]Oh, that's like a... Oh, damn!
[40:11.72]Whoa!
[40:19.70]One shot if you get real close.
[40:20.92]Cool.
[40:21.36]Alright, I'll make it harder.
[40:22.44]Fine.
[40:23.00]Now the next... Is that acid?
[40:33.23]Are they burning me?
[40:34.91]Oh, down there.
[40:35.69]Shit.
[40:39.51]You're gonna suffer if you do that.
[40:46.60]I'm willing to give it a try.
[40:47.58]The portal's work.
[40:53.86]He is pleased.
[40:56.42]He is pleased.
[41:00.30]You won't.
[41:00.74]You won't as well.
[41:01.87]Okay.
[41:03.61]I think you guys all thought I was gonna just... do this.
[41:15.47]What the fuck?
[41:18.19]I don't fucking understand.
[41:21.76]Do I have to move fast?
[41:25.58]This is fucking stupid.
[41:27.12]That's what you thought was gonna happen, isn't it?
[41:28.98]And now you're upset that this guy is just... Holy shit.
[41:32.58]Look at his movement.
[41:33.47]Look at his skill.
[41:34.17]Look at how he's fucking moving around.
[41:36.09]I've never seen him like this before.
[41:37.73]I've never seen anything like this before.
[41:40.73]And I watch some of the top players in the world.
[41:49.32]Oh, I heard him.
[42:09.02]You guys forget.
[42:09.90]There's one thing that I do well.
[42:13.14]And that's... Just fucking beat Sekiro.
[42:16.91]You know what I mean?
[42:18.19]If you give me a game where it's just don't just shoot things, hit things, and don't get hit... I might do pretty well.
[42:24.09]You forget this.
[42:31.77]I mean, and speaking of forgetting, I have the yellow key now.
[42:35.89]And by the way, this is not on the easiest difficulty.
[42:39.15]I've seen, like, this is on the third difficulty.
[42:47.27]Oh, fuck.
[42:47.95]He's resourceful, too.
[43:07.26]Turn difficulty.
[43:07.98]Difficulty.
[43:08.50]No, no!
[43:09.16]Alright.
[43:09.80]I'll put it up one more.
[43:12.64]Fine.
[43:14.18]I got a raid?
[43:14.88]Lazy Purple, thanks for the raid, dude.
[43:16.98]Welcome, everybody.
[43:18.02]From Lazy Purple's stream.
[43:22.07]Thanks a lot, dude.
[43:25.89]Okay, so... Can I go back to the menu?
[43:30.07]So this is sawdust, right?
[43:32.22]Can I leave?
[43:33.66]What happens if I quit this?
[43:37.62]Can I come back to where I am right now?
[43:41.30]Save the game.
[43:45.81]Okay.
[43:46.69]Game is saved.
[43:48.67]So, quit game.
[43:52.59]Yeah, I can't... Difficulties in the settings, but I can't change it, I don't think.
[43:59.66]Oh, I can.
[44:00.20]Okay.
[44:01.30]Alright, so this is... I can take it.
[44:03.22]We're gonna go to Ciro Miedo.
[44:03.94]Ciro Miedo.
[44:12.29]Alright, here you go.
[44:13.95]Here you go.
[44:15.33]Everybody can chill now.
[44:16.39]He's playing on the hard one.
[44:30.91]Alright, so they just move way faster.
[44:39.90]I've been playing this game for like 40 minutes with them moving in a different way.
[44:43.52]So this is going to take a minute to get used to.
[44:45.14]Let's go that way.
[45:10.14]He's too fast.
[45:10.94]He's too fast.
[45:11.68]Alright, I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[45:18.83]Somebody in the chat earlier said, stop, stop shooting, man.
[45:21.51]Don't shoot those.
[45:30.50]Now I feel what you're saying.
[45:50.22]You can reload and... Okay, what color was the key that I just got?
[46:05.92]Purple.
[46:07.28]Okay.
[46:08.74]Let's keep going over here.
[46:09.60]Okay.
[46:50.28]Okay, I'm trying to be... I'm trying to be... I was trying to just, like, make everybody go, like, oh, wow, I... You know what I mean?
[46:56.92]I was just being a... I was being a dick.
[47:03.02]I'm not gonna lie, I was being a dick.
[47:19.48]Alright, give me ammo.
[47:28.80]Yeah, this way, this way, this way.
[47:33.11]It's difficulties back?
[47:33.97]What are you talking about?
[47:43.47]Can't get one by you!
[47:44.43]How do I get on the train?
[47:51.65]Do I have to put the boxes up to get on the train?
[47:54.59]Wait, hold on.
[48:01.12]There's a quicksave, right?
[48:01.98]F6.
[48:02.16]Good.
[48:06.82]Alright, I just need ammo.
[48:14.08]Okay, yellow key.
[48:14.74]It's back here.
[48:15.25]Good to know.
[48:15.65]Wait, what about down here?
[48:19.87]Something else?
[48:20.59]Yep.
[48:22.30]Hold on to these bullets.
[48:34.86]They call them hit him with every shot.
[48:37.42]Elbertson.
[48:37.90]I need a yellow key.
[49:00.35]What was that?
[49:00.95]What was that behind me?
[49:04.68]Someone's shooting from up top.
[49:15.20]Yup, it's you.
[49:16.64]Bastard.
[49:27.87]We got health?
[49:29.15]Not good, actually.
[49:31.19]But not bad.
[49:33.27]Red door over here.
[49:34.13]Okay, shit.
[49:37.36]Where's that key again?
[49:46.34]Oh, fuck.
[49:46.91]I didn't realize it was already selected.
[50:08.20]Nothing in there!
[50:23.87]Okay.
[50:25.97]I should have listened to that guy.
[50:27.07]I was too confident.
[50:30.00]And that guy was like, dude, you shouldn't be doing, don't use your shotgun.
[50:33.74]And I'm like, what do you know?
[50:34.84]What do you know?
[50:35.50]You don't know anything.
[50:36.40]I know everything.
[50:59.38]Hmm.
[51:00.48]There's ammo over here.
[51:01.46]And there's the yellow key.
[51:05.33]Don't tell him.
[51:07.39]I mean, don't tell him.
[51:16.36]What are you... I cannot pay attention to what you guys are doing.
[51:20.98]Oh, up here.
[51:23.74]Press right to zoom.
[51:28.39]HOLY SHIT!
[51:30.37]What the fuck?!
[51:36.84]It said zoom in!
[51:38.12]It gave me a zoom in!
[51:39.46]Oh, and last time I saved it was up here!
[51:41.28]God damn it!
[51:43.38]No!
[51:44.50]No!
[51:45.88]No!
[51:46.30]Okay, I gotta rebind that.
[51:49.56]I'm rebinding that to middle mouse button.
[51:51.62]Okay, hold on.
[51:58.22]Where's my, uh, customized bindings?
[52:02.69]Okay, quick save.
[52:04.37]Middle mouse.
[52:10.05]Good.
[52:12.39]Alright, I'm ready.
[52:17.52]The dev tweeted out the stream.
[52:18.86]Oh, that's awesome.
[52:20.86]Thanks a lot.
[52:24.46]This game's fun.
[52:26.13]Whoa!
[52:26.63]Don't want to get hit.
[52:30.83]Did it save the, uh... It did.
[52:34.37]Okay.
[52:38.09]I'm ready.
[52:42.66]I can't believe I died there.
[52:44.02]That was too fun.
[52:46.72]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[52:48.22]There's, uh... Big... Alright.
[53:14.24]Alright, stop.
[53:15.68]Holy shit, just dodge.
[53:27.94]Alright, we're good.
[53:38.02]Uh-oh.
[53:39.36]I think I pressed, yeah.
[53:40.38]Did I press the button?
[53:42.04]I did.
[53:42.40]I pressed my BPI button.
[53:44.10]Alright, let me take out the... There's still a couple more of those guys left.
[54:13.81]Good.
[54:20.78]Why did I do that?
[54:23.36]Red key.
[54:23.72]Do I have the red key?
[54:24.58]Wait, I have to read the tweet.
[54:27.62]What is the tweet?
[54:29.81]What does it say?
[54:35.69]Don't read it.
[54:36.27]Don't read it.
[54:36.91]Don't read it.
[54:37.43]You can't.
[54:38.27]Alright.
[54:38.59]I won't read it.
[54:39.89]Don't read it?
[54:44.11]I don't know what the tweet says.
[54:46.49]The tweet could say, like, this guy sucks.
[54:55.36]The tweet could actually read, I hate this streamer.
[54:58.70]He's the worst.
[54:59.98]Don't support him ever.
[55:00.96]I don't know.
[55:01.98]It could be anything.
[55:07.98]Oh, fuck!
[55:08.78]Don't die here.
[55:09.72]Okay.
[55:10.26]I forgot about that, dude.
[55:27.24]I gotta get up there.
[55:29.08]Red key.
[55:29.64]Got it.
[55:29.88]No, I won't read the tweet, okay?
[55:36.23]Alright, this is the part... Save it.
[55:37.95]This is the part where I fucked it up last time.
[55:39.21]Okay, sniper rifle.
[55:40.15]But why use the sniper rifle here?
[55:42.03]Should I use it?
[56:10.03]Alright, we're good.
[56:14.53]Chat jubated you.
[56:15.45]Wait, this is not real?
[56:17.45]None of that was real?
[56:18.73]Oh, well, whatever.
[56:20.03]It's okay.
[56:22.47]Alright, I got red key.
[56:23.39]Let's go to red door.
[56:27.11]Eat that hash.
[56:30.01]Can I make this jump?
[56:30.81]No.
[56:30.87]Alright, red door.
[56:33.11]Let's go.
[56:34.71]Where was it?
[56:35.11]I don't remember.
[56:50.79]Why?
[56:56.88]That was a waste.
[57:00.08]I should have done that.
[57:00.64]Save that for the boss.
[57:13.87]Holy shit!
[57:15.30]That's a lot of people.
[57:16.82]That's a lot.
[57:22.97]Read it.
[57:23.41]Don't read it!
[57:24.17]I'm not gonna read it.
[57:24.85]Should I not read it?
[57:25.53]Should I?
[57:33.68]Read it!
[57:34.78]Don't read it!
[57:35.36]What are those globs?
[57:40.07]These are super gems?
[57:47.19]Crystal of Madness.
[57:53.17]Should I breathe this in as deep as I can?
[57:54.94]Alright, I got the yellow key.
[57:59.08]Read it.
[57:59.58]Eat the raspberries.
[58:00.32]Don't eat the raspberries.
[58:01.24]Should I bring this with me?
[58:14.32]Just read it.
[58:15.04]Holy shit.
[58:15.76]The mod said read it.
[58:20.99]Did the mod say read it?
[58:35.46]Oh, okay.
[58:36.14]I've read it.
[58:39.61]Don't tell him about... Okay, I saw it.
[58:45.01]Well, now I know.
[58:45.93]Why did you guys tell me to do that?
[58:48.05]Now I know what's a boss in the game!
[58:50.25]I can't believe you did this to me.
[58:57.42]Alright, I need a yellow door.
[58:58.38]Where was it?
[58:58.82]Somewhere over here?
[58:59.30]I think it was down here.
[59:02.84]Wait!
[59:12.31]There's a ladder.
[59:41.47]Let's go!
[59:45.81]Read the other tweet.
[59:47.09]The other mod tweeted.
[59:48.66]I'm going.
[60:01.08]Read all tweets.
[60:04.28]What is this, a tweet reading stream or is this me playing Dusk and playing like at an 88 out of 100?
[60:23.67]Alright, here we go.
[60:34.01]They weren't human.
[60:34.87]No, they were not.
[60:41.77]Ah, retweet, retweet, retweet.
[60:43.51]Check out some tweets.
[60:44.71]I got a couple of tweets for you.
[60:53.95]I hate Jerma985.
[60:54.93]He's the worst.
[60:55.95]Don't support him ever.
[61:03.55]Well, we all have opinions.
[61:05.31]We can have them.
[61:06.55]It's alright.
[61:08.22]Alright, we're in the mine.
[61:25.57]I don't have any bullets in it.
[61:27.47]Okay, I have pistols only.
[61:31.05]Can I make a sp... Okay, can I... Okay.
[61:35.52]Can...
[61:53.78]Can I talk?
[61:54.64]Uh, can I?
[62:04.58]No talking.
[62:05.67]These things.
[62:06.89]Gotta get close.
[62:07.83]Ooh, diamond.
[62:16.19]The track door opens.
[62:21.82]So, the devs that are watching right now, do you think you could have ever put a minus 50% speed on everything mode?
[62:30.42]What is that?
[62:30.80]There's a ghost here.
[62:37.49]What does the ghost do?
[62:38.47]Is this like Bubble Bobble?
[62:40.41]Am I taking too long?
[62:47.24]Yellow key.
[62:53.55]What is that?
[62:59.68]Two!
[63:00.64]Three shots with this point-blank double-barrel shotgun?
[63:05.71]Damn.
[63:12.18]Could you guys just give me a separate, like, client that was, you know, maybe, like, two times less difficult?
[63:18.82]But just don't... I have it on the hardest difficulty, but you guys have coded a special copy for me so I can pretend to be fucking awesome at this game.
[63:32.11]Holy...
[63:45.39]He already is, we don't even need it.
[63:56.50]Dolly!
[63:57.60]Dolly.
[63:59.42]This is intense, but it doesn't feel... It never feels unfair, even on the second hardest difficulty in the game.
[64:08.85]I feel like I'm in control.
[64:10.05]If that makes any sense.
[64:26.86]Oh my fuck!
[64:31.55]I'm dead.
[64:31.97]No, I'm not.
[64:33.37]Almost.
[64:33.87]If I didn't miss that first shot, I would've been dead.
[64:36.17]Alright, hold on.
[64:41.76]What's that mean?
[64:42.30]What does that mean?
[64:46.92]Oh god damn it, man.
[64:48.42]Holy shit.
[65:08.12]Is this the load?
[65:08.72]Is this the save?
[65:09.36]Is this the one that I just saved?
[65:13.44]I think so, right?
[65:15.22]Yes, it is.
[65:28.93]Oh, my God.
[65:29.69]Don't get stuck.
[65:30.11]I'm stuck.
[65:30.77]I'm stuck.
[65:32.55]It don't matter.
[65:32.99]I can get out.
[65:33.55]Oh, my God.
[65:34.37]I can't get out.
[65:35.33]Oh, my God.
[65:37.55]How did I live?
[65:39.38]How did I live?
[65:40.92]There's no way.
[65:42.24]Thanks a lot, Dev.
[65:42.96]I appreciate it for that, like, fucking extra copy of the game that you coded.
[65:47.60]When I get, when there's five enemies surrounding me, I'm always gonna get out.
[66:02.71]Okay.
[66:07.13]If I get touched, I'm dead.
[66:10.53]I hear a fucking chainsaw guy.
[66:15.77]Those are the worst, because the difficulty went up, so they're ten times faster.
[66:19.76]Which way is he?
[66:20.36]There's a red key.
[66:23.08]Oh my god, just stay.
[66:24.36]Oh my god, he's right there.
[66:32.63]Red door.
[66:42.15]Where you at?
[66:42.69]Where you at?
[67:22.83]Ah, slow down.
[67:26.22]I'm almost out of ammo.
[67:33.22]What did that do?
[67:46.91]I don't know.
[67:48.45]Can I open this?
[67:53.67]Nice.
[67:53.91]Fun.
[67:54.85]Cool.
[67:59.20]I killed all the enemies.
[68:06.22]Very cool.
[68:06.94]Let me make sure I save it.
[68:08.10]Dead of the night.
[68:09.89]And we're going to do this.
[68:10.85]We're going to go to sound.
[68:12.29]We're going to drop the master volume.
[68:13.83]Put the music up a little bit more.
[68:17.26]What are the subtitles for?
[68:23.20]Red door.
[68:27.82]Gold coin bonus.
[68:31.60]That's a lot of- That's a lot of people.
[68:47.76]Oh, it's already happening.
[68:48.84]Okay.
[68:49.56]Uh, strategy.
[68:50.33]Pistols for a little while.
[68:51.55]Ah, he just walked into it.
[69:02.72]Is that guy extra fast or something?
[69:13.87]Alright, damn.
[69:14.71]I gotta... Okay.
[69:28.89]Let me conti- No time to stop.
[69:38.36]I gotta move.
[69:46.18]Do I go down?
[69:46.68]I found a secret.
[69:54.26]Yes.
[69:54.84]Alright, what is it going to give me?
[70:07.65]Uh.
[70:09.59]Where am I?
[70:10.81]Priceless diamond.
[70:11.65]I get 50.
[70:13.11]Ooh!
[70:13.78]Ooh!
[70:16.53]Damn it.
[70:22.93]I just lost all that.
[70:24.17]Alright, hold on.
[70:25.55]Let me go back in there.
[70:31.12]There's another secret in there.
[70:31.92]Another way to go.
[70:35.48]How did I get there?
[70:37.94]I don't remember how I got there.
[70:39.68]I'm serious.
[70:55.16]Another secret.
[70:56.40]Dang it.
[70:58.08]That's two.
[71:12.91]Alright, blue's back there.
[71:17.72]Health.
[71:18.20]Alright, 72 health.
[71:19.02]Save it right here.
[71:22.62]I don't remember.
[71:23.32]I forget.
[71:25.42]I'm sorry, everybody.
[71:27.00]I can't get the other part of that secret.
[71:28.50]I have no idea what that was.
[71:29.64]I'm moving so fast.
[71:31.50]I don't know.
[71:43.09]Ah, tiny little quarters.
[71:47.59]What's that breathing?
[72:06.03]I thought I didn't die.
[72:06.67]There's too many rooms.
[72:10.07]Alright.
[72:10.69]One room at a time.
[72:11.35]Slow.
[72:16.08]That's the way to get out?
[72:27.93]This booksh- This bookcase is weird, right?
[72:29.97]This is a weird place for a book?
[72:31.53]Weird.
[72:46.48]Alright, we're good.
[73:03.69]Crap, I get that soap?
[73:06.71]Good call.
[73:07.05]What was that?
[73:12.28]I hear something.
[73:21.77]Oh my god!
[73:22.97]Alright, slow down.
[73:35.36]Oh!
[73:35.52]I got the blue key.
[73:40.60]That's so...
[74:02.73]Dude, the soap takes too much time.
[74:05.67]It does.
[74:05.99]It's a great weapon, but damn, it takes a long time to use.
[74:08.47]Fireplace?
[74:22.02]Eat.
[74:23.14]Eat glass.
[74:23.88]Eat glass.
[74:32.84]I don't need it.
[74:41.47]What?
[74:41.83]Hold on.
[74:42.39]Easy!
[74:44.17]I'm gonna have to use a rifle.
[74:49.89]What's the lightning there from?
[74:53.29]Is that a crossbow?
[75:06.89]Oh, fucking God!
[75:08.71]They just... No!
[75:10.09]Oh, Jesus.
[75:14.62]Oh!
[75:16.30]Oh!
[75:18.14]Was he throwing all of those?
[75:19.64]No.
[75:21.32]Alright.
[75:21.88]I'll give you that.
[75:25.12]Okay.
[75:26.92]Give me the crossbow.
[75:27.96]Crossbow.
[75:28.56]Bolts will pass through enemies and walls.
[75:31.82]Really?
[75:34.74]A lot of items...
[75:37.45]Oh my fucking Jesus, what just happened?
[75:43.08]Where did I just save it?
[75:45.86]Right here, thank God.
[75:49.65]Give me the crossbow.
[75:57.58]Fuck it, let's go.
[76:12.15]Didn't spawn.
[76:12.89]Oh, yeah, they did.
[76:15.79]Oh my goodness.
[76:23.36]I need to heal.
[76:29.20]Oh, you.
[76:29.92]Over there.
[76:30.44]Where are you?
[76:32.54]Got ya.
[76:34.49]And the guy with the shotgun.
[76:36.19]It's alright.
[76:36.81]I'll take him.
[76:42.28]What do we got?
[76:53.67]Health?
[76:56.45]Nana?
[77:10.03]Yeah, I'll get on these roofs.
[77:16.13]Bounce on the other side.
[77:19.21]Good.
[77:19.45]I need to get all the rubes.
[77:23.31]Alright.
[77:23.81]Now, where's that sacred?
[77:30.36]It was one of the silos, right?
[77:37.28]There it is.
[77:37.86]Alright.
[77:41.86]It went that way.
[77:42.52]Let's go up here.
[77:45.11]Nice.
[77:45.91]Good.
[77:47.61]Alright.
[77:48.73]I think I'm ready to move on.
[77:50.75]I've got the blue key.
[77:57.53]Wait!
[78:00.99]Nice.
[78:02.07]Okay, I'm in a good spot.
[78:03.67]Shave it.
[78:03.99]Let's get out.
[78:07.83]And I'll open up that blue door.
[78:18.96]Why am I talking funny?
[78:23.65]Bald.
[78:24.83]That's very funny.
[78:34.05]Got one.
[78:34.87]Whatever.
[78:47.95]Red key now.
[78:50.05]Alright, time to take out the big gun.
[78:51.35]I feel like I'm going to get stomped on out here.
[78:59.16]Should have used the rifle.
[79:00.12]What am I thinking?
[79:02.56]The rifle's instantaneous.
[79:08.56]Now we get in close with the super shotgun.
[79:15.87]Good.
[79:17.52]Red door.
[79:24.95]Guys, watch out for that.
[79:26.60]I knew you were gonna be in here.
[79:31.06]And your friend.
[79:46.61]There's another one.
[79:48.27]Oh, there's one of you!
[79:49.28]Did I miss?
[80:07.73]No, throw it!
[80:08.99]Throw the gas!
[80:10.75]Throw the gas!
[80:11.39]I can't even pick it up!
[80:30.10]Rub lotion on skin.
[80:42.61]What?
[80:42.79]I don't know.
[80:43.13]There could be something down here.
[80:48.11]No hose for me.
[81:04.86]Trinkets.
[81:06.36]Nice.
[81:06.64]Trinkets.
[81:10.30]Left or right.
[81:10.78]Let's go up.
[81:13.48]Oh, man.
[81:24.64]There's a lot of those guys.
[81:26.70]Shoot through them.
[81:36.47]You're not making this easy, are you?
[81:43.47]How did you miss that?
[81:44.37]I don't know.
[81:48.17]Alright, let me open the... Actually, I'll stay up here for a minute.
[81:56.77]Oh my god!
[81:59.86]I'm trying to conserve!
[82:02.12]I'm trying to conserve!
[82:12.45]Sanctum of the Worthy.
[82:13.41]Not there yet.
[82:14.03]Not going in there.
[82:26.14]Nothing else for me to grab.
[82:32.56]I already got all the max... Alright.
[82:34.78]Maximum that.
[82:36.11]We're good.
[82:36.77]Okay.
[82:37.89]There we go.
[82:38.31]Sanctum of the Worthy.
[82:39.41]Get out my shotgun.
[82:40.33]That's my favorite weapon.
[82:45.73]This is absolutely a boss fight.
[82:47.61]Why would there be this much stuff?
[82:54.03]What do these do?
[83:05.46]Alright, I know what I gotta do.
[83:11.98]Shoot through them?
[83:16.60]That's double damage.
[83:20.59]Wait, the other one didn't come out yet.
[83:22.87]What's going on?
[83:49.59]I thought maybe this would be one of those scenarios where I could just press the three buttons and then they all die.
[83:54.35]Alright, I'm ready.
[84:10.42]Can I knock these away?
[84:11.40]Alright, don't fucking run.
[84:19.20]Oh my god, okay.
[84:20.99]I gotta- I gotta- I- New plan.
[84:30.21]What?
[84:32.17]Okay.
[84:38.63]Uh...
[84:47.34]Unworthy.
[84:48.66]Let's try it again.
[84:52.93]Do these have to hit a surface?
[84:54.23]How far do these go?
[84:55.09]Let me see.
[84:56.17]These go forever.
[84:57.55]Until they hit something.
[85:04.37]Don't spread them out!
[85:04.99]Don't spread out!
[85:05.51]Don't spread out!
[85:09.85]That guy's got double tapped.
[85:11.91]Bad.
[85:39.57]Not dead!
[85:39.97]Not dead!
[85:40.37]Not dead!
[85:40.81]Dead!
[85:50.89]Okay.
[85:51.75]One.
[85:52.51]Two.
[85:53.19]Three.
[85:53.31]Saved.
[85:59.51]There's gotta be something right behind this door.
[86:02.85]How do you open the door?
[86:17.46]What?
[86:21.46]Oh, okay.
[86:31.37]I didn't know what this did.
[86:32.29]Alright, I did it.
[86:34.41]Nice.
[86:34.67]Let's go.
[86:41.90]I took damage.
[86:42.70]It's alright.
[86:52.15]Through the gate.
[86:55.43]Ooh.
[86:59.74]I stood still.
[87:00.34]You can't stand still in this game.
[87:03.66]Put the death token.
[87:06.16]They knew I installed it.
[87:06.98]They said, dude, I heard you installed the game.
[87:08.50]And I'm like, yeah, it sounds like fun.
[87:11.30]It's like, you can't stand still, though.
[87:13.28]It's really important.
[87:13.90]I want to make sure you get a good stream.
[87:15.30]I was like, holy shit, I appreciate that, dude.
[87:20.07]And he was like, and you suck so bad at games.
[87:22.59]Like, please don't make our game look bad.
[87:25.82]Like, I'm trying to help you so you don't, like, I don't want people to think the game's good.
[87:30.30]Not watch your shitty gameplay and then, like, not buy it.
[87:32.45]And I was like, dude, the game's good.
[87:50.20]Dave would actually say that.
[87:51.44]I don't know who that is, but... Save her.
[88:11.00]He's just like, yeah, dude, I mean, the carnival was, like, really fucking cool.
[88:14.59]That was a really awesome stream you did, a cool stream.
[88:16.83]Um, but, I mean, but you, like, this is a hard game with, like, a lot of Twitch reactions and shit.
[88:22.65]I, they, please, try.
[88:24.87]This one's for you.
[88:37.88]That's a little spot.
[88:48.11]I hear birds.
[88:50.57]What's the bird, enemy?
[88:51.45]Oh my goodness.
[89:04.60]Don't hide?
[89:05.24]I have to!
[89:08.12]What's this bird?
[89:14.70]I hear a bird.
[89:15.62]And it's freaking me out, man.
[89:17.06]How do I get up there?
[89:35.84]Ah!
[89:36.12]Whoa!
[89:36.68]My whole body hurts.
[89:38.82]What was there?
[89:39.36]Oh my goodness!
[89:51.84]I said, hold on, I just got a DM from the devs.
[89:56.50]I said, hey dude, just, hold on, I'm trying to read this.
[90:01.70]Hey dude, just wanted to let you know that we've refunded the game for you.
[90:06.28]Please don't play again.
[90:08.34]What the fuck?
[90:10.62]This is the worst gameplay I've ever seen.
[90:13.01]What the fuck?
[90:15.67]Why?
[90:15.87]What?
[90:25.79]This is really fun.
[90:27.31]Why didn't I play this, like, a year ago?
[90:30.03]Why didn't you guys tell me to play this?
[90:31.55]Actually, ten of you did, like, a hundred times.
[90:33.43]Where are we going?
[90:46.46]I need the yellow key.
[90:48.70]Ooh!
[90:52.22]Look at that!
[90:54.71]Played in VR?
[90:56.11]I don't think I could ever do this in VR.
[91:01.97]VR, no way.
[91:03.17]Does VR exist for this?
[91:13.20]I just got destroyed.
[91:15.98]What the fuck are they?
[91:22.87]Is that it?
[91:24.03]No, I can still hear them.
[91:29.35]What is up there?
[91:37.56]Weapon in there?
[91:38.18]How do I get in there?
[91:41.06]Teleporter?
[91:47.69]Well, I'll be damned.
[91:59.81]Look at that.
[92:03.49]Can this thing break?
[92:05.10]Or do I just have this forever now?
[92:13.40]Cool.
[92:13.80]Alright, so how do I actually progress?
[92:16.17]I need to go through the teleporter.
[92:17.99]Alright, let's progress.
[92:19.85]Progression.
[92:21.25]This way.
[92:28.03]Well, that's a really good thing to do.
[92:29.51]I guess I could jump on top.
[92:30.85]No key, though.
[92:33.87]That's where the yellow key is.
[92:37.60]Over there?
[92:39.14]Over... No, where?
[92:40.92]Here?
[92:44.38]I'll try the sword.
[92:48.26]Oh, I get the red key?
[92:49.20]Oh, I did get the red key.
[92:50.46]You're right.
[92:50.82]Let me try the sword out, though.
[92:55.22]Seems like a fun thing to use.
[93:07.77]What was the red door?
[93:12.54]I hear something.
[93:13.24]Alright, I'm... I don't think I can Excalibur these guys.
[93:29.33]I'll try it.
[93:32.93]He just headshot me.
[93:39.44]Give me the soap.
[93:50.62]Holy shit this is pretty good.
[94:03.23]It's because of this guy in here.
[94:04.31]Fuck me up.
[94:06.82]Give me the soul!
[94:32.71]Where'd it go?
[94:43.26]Where is it?
[94:43.58]Is it breaking?
[94:48.22]Dude, pog, let's go.
[94:49.52]Dude, pog, let's go.
[94:54.53]Pog, let's go.
[95:06.66]Whoa, shit!
[95:07.34]That guy went so fast!
[95:09.62]Oh my god!
[95:10.18]What do I do?
[95:11.10]What do I do?
[95:11.48]What do I do?
[95:12.02]What do I do?
[95:13.06]What do I do?
[95:16.30]They can't get in if I have the box in front.
[95:37.65]These guys move so quick.
[95:46.00]God damn it.
[95:49.58]Okay.
[95:55.89]That scared the shit out of me.
[95:58.61]You're playing this like a horror game?
[95:59.83]It is!
[95:59.95]Aw, it is!
[96:04.09]You don't think... You didn't scream at that part?
[96:07.60]When you turned that corner, you didn't scream?
[96:09.68]I bet you did.
[96:27.34]I bet you anything.
[96:28.76]When that happened, you put your hand in the air and you went like...
[96:33.28]Like I did.
[96:34.54]Can't get up there.
[96:40.00]This guy's gonna get up.
[96:52.44]I know it.
[96:52.84]He's gonna do it!
[97:07.03]Grenade.
[97:08.53]Wait, ready?
[97:09.05]Here it goes.
[97:09.53]One, two, three.
[97:10.77]What just happened?
[97:11.41]Did you shoot that out of my hand?
[97:13.35]Oh my god.
[97:15.61]He's gonna do it.
[97:18.81]I know he is.
[97:42.44]Blue key?
[97:47.74]I'm alright.
[98:01.15]Here he comes.
[98:04.03]One, two, three.
[98:08.80]Son of a bitch!
[98:10.64]Son of a... God damn it!
[98:12.66]He headshot me.
[98:13.76]They're too good.
[98:14.52]Is this military?
[98:26.95]This... They have... Alright.
[98:35.09]I did it.
[98:40.94]Back around the corner.
[98:41.78]Alright, I only have... Let's just go with the sword.
[98:48.96]That was a huge mistake.
[98:51.28]It was awful.
[98:51.94]It was a really bad idea, but I'm still alive, and I'm mad about it, because I wish I'd just died, so I could start with a bit more health.
[98:59.61]Alright, there's a Ghostbusters 2 slime gun.
[99:01.55]It's a grenade launcher.
[99:13.48]He has to use two.
[99:15.26]Pepe left.
[99:16.66]Whatever.
[99:17.14]Whatever!
[99:35.31]What did that do?
[99:36.21]Gate control?
[99:47.61]Uh, alright.
[99:49.11]Where's the gate?
[99:52.50]Gate?
[100:14.61]Where's the gate?
[100:19.15]Did I miss the gate?
[100:21.63]This is where I, uh... Was I down here?
[100:27.46]No, not here.
[100:28.56]Where is it?
[100:42.68]Back where the blue key was.
[100:49.43]They're fighting each other.
[100:50.11]Let them fight.
[100:56.42]Holy shit.
[100:57.16]This is chaos in here.
[101:07.82]Watch out for the scarecrow with the shotgun.
[101:11.18]Let them kill each other.
[101:28.41]What is crates?
[101:29.21]Oh, grenades.
[101:30.25]I see.
[101:36.36]Ow.
[101:38.46]Ow!
[101:40.10]Not smart.
[101:44.78]Hey!
[102:10.66]Oops, random money.
[102:12.39]That's it.
[102:22.08]Fold that.
[102:22.80]Fold that.
[102:23.46]Save it here.
[102:25.68]Good.
[102:26.12]I'm so happy right now.
[102:29.06]Posted no trespassing.
[102:31.39]Oh, no trespassing.
[102:32.37]Oh, look at that.
[102:40.62]This place is doomed.
[102:42.62]Not done in the level yet.
[102:51.69]Alright, fine.
[102:52.09]End the level.
[102:58.91]When is he going to play Sniper Contract?
[103:01.63]Um... I already did.
[103:04.73]And... It was not a fan favorite.
[103:09.55]It was a, uh... Not a fan favorite.
[103:14.86]Oh.
[103:15.40]Right off the bat.
[103:18.56]Secret.
[103:20.94]You want me to do sniping?
[103:21.82]Alright.
[103:22.14]I can do that.
[103:35.33]Where is he?
[103:38.53]Where is this dude?
[103:41.45]Who the fuck is he?
[103:41.93]I don't know.
[103:54.41]I tried to jump, I'm an idiot.
[103:56.91]Blue door, back here.
[103:57.69]No!
[104:00.05]Please!
[104:14.61]Okay.
[104:17.23]Can I get in there?
[104:18.73]Ooh.
[104:23.83]Slow it up.
[104:30.92]What the fuck was that?
[104:39.63]I got in.
[104:44.56]Where the hell... There's gonna be a chainsaw guy right here.
[104:59.59]No, but... Alright, cool.
[105:00.85]Alright, get in there.
[105:21.55]There's a ladder.
[105:27.73]Damn it.
[105:28.01]I don't think I can get in here.
[105:31.45]Well, let's go.
[105:33.21]Use props.
[105:34.19]What do you mean, props?
[105:35.15]Use props.
[105:42.89]You can pick up boxes and use props to go up there?
[105:48.99]Wait, uh... Can I?
[105:51.99]Do I have to crouch jump?
[105:55.65]Oh, well, I think I destroyed all the boxes.
[105:59.79]We don't need everything.
[106:01.41]We just need most of it.
[106:12.38]That's a secret?
[106:13.24]I just walked behind cars.
[106:16.82]Use a barrel.
[106:17.98]And then you called me a dumbass.
[106:19.84]So, um... Like... Should I listen to that person?
[106:26.41]Very rude.
[106:26.97]Alright, just want to get that.
[106:54.14]Got it.
[106:57.88]Alright, blue door's back here.
[106:59.20]I will not remember.
[106:59.90]Actually, books and beer, I'll know that.
[107:01.70]I will remember that one.
[107:02.36]Let's move.
[107:06.14]Another secret in here.
[107:12.53]What is that?
[107:13.01]Why is that blocked off like that?
[107:20.55]Dammit, really?
[107:30.29]No, I wanted to save that!
[107:31.47]Can I get up there?
[107:54.01]Just making sure.
[107:57.03]Secret located.
[107:57.73]I don't think I can do this.
[108:03.14]No.
[108:03.74]Whatever.
[108:04.12]I can jump on top, though, can't I?
[108:08.50]Eh.
[108:09.66]Ooh.
[108:19.93]I can go down.
[108:23.49]Just, please.
[108:25.99]How does that not kill you?
[108:26.79]I don't know.
[108:27.63]I should probably use the sword on these guys.
[108:29.23]Instead of freaking out.
[108:31.11]I can swing once.
[108:38.45]But I can't panic.
[108:39.53]That's hard.
[108:41.45]That's asking a lot.
[109:01.36]Don't use the mortars here.
[109:03.59]Keep the shotgun out.
[109:04.75]That's the bread and butter.
[109:08.38]I feel safe with... I need a yellow key.
[109:15.50]Shit.
[109:15.96]Yellow key is down here.
[109:17.25]Into, like, the weird great sewer thing.
[109:20.45]Alright, so I'm just gonna keep going over this way.
[109:31.04]I can jump.
[109:35.00]What's it gonna jump to?
[109:38.49]Ooh.
[109:39.23]Can I jump to there?
[109:39.87]Let's see.
[109:47.39]Oh, yes, I can.
[109:52.19]I can do it.
[109:52.65]Give me that first.
[110:13.00]How do I get over there?
[110:14.34]I know I can get this.
[110:19.66]Should I crouch jump into this?
[110:20.84]Because I hit... Oh, here we are.
[110:26.66]Oh, yellow key.
[110:39.24]Down into the basement.
[110:43.64]Ooh.
[110:44.40]I can go that way.
[110:45.02]Wait.
[110:45.64]Wait.
[110:52.30]Oh, fuck.
[110:55.94]I hear chainsaws.
[110:57.16]I hear them.
[110:58.56]I hear them.
[111:00.05]They're in here somewhere.
[111:01.61]Down here.
[111:02.11]I know.
[111:02.93]I can hear them.
[111:09.05]Oh, you prick.
[111:09.67]Which way are you going?
[111:19.88]And a chest.
[111:20.26]What's in it?
[111:23.04]Not a whole lot, actually.
[111:26.91]Not a whole lot.
[111:28.41]Okay, well, I have plenty of shotgun shells.
[111:29.79]Alright.
[111:32.97]Back down to where I was.
[111:35.17]Into the basement thing.
[111:38.60]Which was over here, was it?
[111:40.98]Yes, it was.
[111:42.22]Yellow key.
[111:43.22]Open yellow door.
[111:44.36]Save game.
[111:46.64]Let's go.
[112:02.78]That's too stressful.
[112:16.33]Should I go down?
[112:18.13]I guess.
[112:18.61]I'm going under here?
[112:20.25]Secret in here?
[112:22.19]Kind of.
[112:24.77]Maybe a little?
[112:25.47]What's this do?
[112:26.15]Flick the switch.
[112:26.93]I don't know.
[112:37.46]Now we go up.
[112:50.96]I know I'm hiding.
[112:51.80]Yes, I know.
[112:52.38]OK, so now I can travel to up.
[113:10.37]What am I looking for here?
[113:11.73]Probably the blue key?
[113:19.70]Go up here and this goes around and then down.
[113:24.96]And then... There's a sludge here.
[113:28.26]Ooh, red key.
[113:28.90]I don't remember there being a red door.
[113:34.55]What the fuck?
[113:49.55]Give me the thing I'm looking for!
[114:30.58]Give me that.
[114:41.08]Blue key, got it.
[114:44.56]You spawning something on me, buddy?
[114:46.64]Where they at?
[114:48.69]Yeah, there they are.
[114:49.75]I see it.
[115:03.78]Collect everything.
[115:05.30]Don't leave without full everything.
[115:07.74]Doesn't matter... I'm not going to let you ruin my day.
[115:13.25]Alright, full everything.
[115:18.93]Full health.
[115:19.99]Full weapons.
[115:21.29]Full ammo.
[115:22.11]Full armor.
[115:24.31]Blue key.
[115:25.53]Coming up.
[115:55.61]That sucked.
[116:12.91]I'm gonna die up here!
[116:22.09]Alright, I'm gonna get the health that was down here.
[116:26.27]Can I teleport back?
[116:27.67]Ah, I can't.
[116:29.07]Oh well.
[116:37.00]Uh, what about any health that I missed?
[116:40.76]I can't be opened.
[116:44.68]What's that?
[116:46.16]Nothing.
[116:46.48]Oh, wait.
[116:49.31]I get a good view.
[116:51.25]Nope, it's just blue door time.
[117:06.09]You take a lot of hits.
[117:07.59]Nice health.
[117:08.55]Good.
[117:09.67]I'm ready.
[117:11.03]I'm happy.
[117:13.25]Flick it.
[117:18.98]There were ten secrets in that level, are you serious?
[117:25.17]That's a lot.
[117:27.63]We are now at creations.
[117:34.09]Are you preparing for what's next?
[117:38.17]It depends.
[117:40.95]What do I have to do?
[117:41.60]I got the... the Hallowed Health.
[117:51.32]Yeah, how do you respond to that question?
[117:54.95]Yes.
[118:57.83]Are there scientists in here?
[118:58.75]Is this a cutscene?
[119:01.11]Should I not fight?
[119:03.01]This is probably a cutscene.
[119:06.89]Alright, that was a pretty good cutscene.
[119:12.97]Now, what's the boss that this obviously is?
[119:19.41]Let's go with my grenade launchers.
[119:23.94]Open the door.
[119:26.62]Just stand here and wait.
[119:28.48]Open door.
[119:29.16]Quarantine release.
[119:38.29]Do not touch.
[120:40.98]Let's go!
[120:49.88]What's next?
[120:51.56]More buttons.
[120:53.52]Another code to crack.
[120:54.54]I think I can handle it.
[120:58.05]What are we doing?
[120:58.81]100 health, 4, anything else I can grab while I'm up here?
[121:00.95]Just while I have a minute?
[121:07.27]Alright, here we go.
[121:08.35]Save it here.
[121:18.99]Um, wait, hold on.
[121:21.62]Second experiment.
[121:22.86]How many experiments are there?
[121:25.24]We got a lot of experiments in here.
[121:31.09]Okay.
[121:32.27]Well, uh, let's go.
[121:54.02]Alright, is there more experiments?
[122:03.63]Should I not have done that?
[122:05.45]Wait.
[122:12.16]This.
[122:22.96]Alright, that was called Creations.
[122:26.92]That's cool.
[122:31.12]I just... I did it!
[122:32.24]I beat Level 1!
[122:39.18]The meathook wounds on your back still throb as you make your way down the cold, black, and bloody hallways that once held these monstrous creatures.
[122:45.83]You leave the ruined town of Dusk behind, littered with the corpses of the possessed, hoping never to return.
[122:52.14]From the distance standing, imposing silhouettes of what appear to be military facilities.
[122:55.41]But why?
[122:55.93]A dark voice pushes forward.
[122:56.99]Do you truly seek answers?
[122:58.95]Or is it simply too late to turn back?
[123:00.37]Continue the dusk experience in episode two.
[123:03.75]The facilities.
[123:11.34]When's that come out?
[123:22.70]New episode?
[123:24.96]Oh, it's already here.
[123:27.40]It's already here.
[123:32.34]It came out today.
[123:33.76]Look at that.
[123:34.62]It came out today.
[123:41.88]Alright, let me show you guys something.
[123:44.74]This difficulty is not intended for a first playthrough.
[123:47.88]This is my first playthrough.
[123:54.70]That's what I've been doing.
[124:01.77]Do Duskmare for one level.
[124:03.15]Alright, I'll turn it on for one level.
[124:15.37]How fast is the chainsaw, guys?
[124:21.41]Oh, right, because it's a new level.
[124:26.14]I don't like this.
[124:27.17]I want to have all my stuff.
[124:36.50]It's not about how fast you can go, guys.
[124:38.28]It's about how cool you look.
[124:41.26]I think I look kind of cool in some of these fights.
[125:26.91]That's too far away.
[125:27.79]That's not fair.
[125:35.24]Guns.
[125:35.74]Give me.
[125:37.36]Any more guns?
[125:38.04]Yeah.
[125:38.50]Of course there is.
[125:39.24]Imagine if I didn't look back here.
[125:42.84]I'm smart enough to know that now.
[125:48.87]He's malding.
[125:50.45]Why am I malding?
[125:52.45]What the hell did I do?
[126:00.41]We got a raid?
[126:02.51]Another raid?
[126:03.07]This is like raid two tonight.
[126:04.23]Damn.
[126:04.95]Tomato!
[126:05.60]What's up, Tomato?
[126:07.50]How the fuck are you, dude?
[126:12.02]Hope your stream was good.
[126:14.12]Welcome, everybody.
[126:14.90]That was a tomato stream.
[126:15.80]Thanks for the raid.
[126:16.26]I wonder what you were doing.
[126:20.90]I don't know why I just did that.
[126:21.82]This is what happens when my brain has to focus on two things at the same time.
[126:26.75]I just threw a box in the air and tried to shoot it.
[126:30.19]I don't know what I was doing.
[126:31.73]But thank you.
[126:32.83]Welcome, everybody.
[126:33.57]We're playing Dusk.
[126:37.27]And I think I got everything I need.
[126:38.25]I got the blue keycard.
[126:41.55]Red door's back here.
[126:42.29]Alright, I'm fucking ready.
[126:45.09]Let's rock and roll.
[126:46.49]You guys ready to see some action?
[126:47.99]Check this shit out.
[126:51.71]Now, I typically, if you guys are new to the channel, typically I play The Sims.
[126:55.47]I play The Sims 3.
[126:57.76]Four days a week.
[126:59.50]But I'm known to play a little bit of FPS gaming from, you know, sometimes.
[127:17.90]But yeah, if you're looking for some Sims 3 gameplay, so far we have about 10 years going strong.
[127:25.24]I have an entire family tree.
[127:27.26]It's been 10 generations now?
[127:31.30]15 people in the family.
[127:32.04]It's been going on for about 8 to 10 years on YouTube and on Twitch.
[127:35.51]Alright, let me get behind here.
[127:45.87]Actually do that, though.
[127:48.73]What was the point of this?
[127:59.66]Can I not get up here?
[128:00.26]Do I have to do this?
[128:05.35]Oh, here we go.
[128:20.64]There we go.
[128:21.00]Up here.
[128:22.44]And then... Around the... Is there anything on the other side on this one?
[128:26.45]I feel like there'd be something back here.
[128:28.57]But there's not.
[128:29.09]Oh, I have the blue fucking key.
[128:33.15]Oh, god damn.
[128:34.47]What an imbecile.
[128:35.25]I didn't... I didn't even know I picked it up.
[128:37.61]I'm a Sims player, okay?
[128:39.03]Sorry.
[128:48.05]What is that?
[128:49.57]That's a big fat guy.
[128:56.60]Is he explode too?
[128:57.52]Alright, they explode.
[128:58.46]Be aware of that.
[129:21.33]Dude, I kinda like going fast.
[129:22.53]Where's the big guy?
[129:23.17]I just heard him.
[129:27.51]Is it a flamethrower?
[129:29.69]Whoa!
[129:31.15]Oops.
[129:32.71]Okay.
[129:51.39]Uh, I'm on the other side.
[129:52.49]Oh, hey, rat!
[129:57.02]Zoomer versus Boomer.
[129:58.86]Who am I in this scenario?
[130:34.61]Just the right amount.
[130:35.93]Just the right amount of shots.
[130:37.19]Sometimes you need to call out a friend.
[130:43.57]And sometimes you need a friend.
[130:52.27]I will sit here and farm this.
[130:53.67]I don't care.
[130:54.15]I ain't gonna let that happen.
[131:01.18]I'm not gonna go on the roof and get stomped by this guy.
[131:06.83]Bad, but you bad, bad, bad, but you bad, bad, bad, but you bad, bad, bad.
[131:23.17]Shots, right?
[131:23.63]Yep.
[131:24.41]Yep.
[131:25.35]Uh, wait, give me the diamond.
[131:26.49]Uh, red cartridge.
[131:32.03]Cool.
[131:34.47]Remember,
[131:36.26]When Jeremy plays a game that he has to focus 100% on, you just get the names of things that he's looking at.
[131:44.53]For all of his dialog.
[131:50.57]Yellow key?
[131:54.77]Okay, jump up.
[132:02.31]NPC commentary.
[132:04.29]See, imagine if I had not done this.
[132:07.60]You guys would have been like, don't tell him.
[132:22.87]He doesn't know.
[132:23.53]Get up there.
[132:26.49]Alright, good shotgun bullets.
[132:27.67]Wait a minute.
[132:28.11]I thought that was a person.
[132:29.88]What is that?
[132:30.32]Super sickle?
[132:31.86]Ooh, should I get it?
[132:33.10]Yeah.
[132:34.65]I think so.
[132:35.19]I'm gonna try.
[132:35.67]Let's do a little bit of balancing.
[132:40.13]Oops.
[132:41.01]You know, there's no fall damage, right?
[132:42.03]Okay, good.
[132:42.75]Try it again.
[132:43.97]I saw... I'm a... I'm a squirrel, I swear to God.
[132:47.52]I'm just trying to get that thing.
[132:48.74]I'm just trying to get the little Death Star.
[132:50.82]Alright.
[132:54.98]That way.
[133:02.80]It takes us this way.
[133:03.66]Can I jump from here to there somewhere?
[133:05.26]Uh, no, I can't.
[133:07.96]How do I get up there?
[133:08.68]How do I do that?
[133:19.56]I can get up there.
[133:20.36]Hold on, wait.
[133:36.48]Okay, now... Gah, come on!
[133:51.37]I'm trying to jump into that window!
[134:13.85]Oh.
[134:15.11]Okay, I gotta slow down.
[134:16.61]Wait.
[134:19.47]What's the play here?
[134:31.72]I can't jump up.
[134:35.78]What am I supposed to do, though?
[134:36.84]How do I get up there?
[134:43.93]I did the thing I wanted to do, but I didn't get what I wanted.
[134:46.49]Hold on.
[134:47.41]This guy wouldn't last two minutes.
[134:48.95]What did I just step on?
[134:49.67]I can get up there.
[134:54.80]Hold on.
[134:55.06]I'm gonna try to get back in there.
[135:07.40]There we go.
[135:10.42]Okay, so... Um... Are there a tower or something?
[135:16.07]Let me see.
[135:20.65]How do I get that?
[135:31.30]Can I climb up that thing?
[135:33.74]Wait...
[135:37.73]Oh, there's a fucking gun right there.
[135:38.99]Double shotgun.
[135:39.67]Just get it.
[135:40.09]Alright, double shotgun.
[135:50.54]Okay, so... I wanna get... I wanna get this stuff.
[135:56.82]But I don't... I don't know how to do it.
[135:58.24]Okay, then...
[136:10.24]Help me!
[136:10.48]No.
[136:10.54]What do you mean no?
[136:32.43]I'm asking for your help.
[136:37.45]It's more fun when you don't know.
[136:41.82]Obviously, I mean, I have to go from here to there.
[136:44.22]Do I have to jump from there to there?
[136:46.04]That's what I was thinking of trying to do.
[136:47.23]That's the only way to get over there.
[137:10.23]Okay.
[137:12.63]I'm not quite correct, though.
[137:41.09]Uh... What about over here?
[137:43.97]Can I do anything with these?
[137:52.94]Um... Do I just come back with a barrel?
[137:57.00]No, it's probably something so simple that I'm not seeing.
[138:02.71]Let me try that again.
[138:04.19]Wait, it's F9, right?
[138:16.32]Death from above?
[138:17.58]What does that mean?
[138:28.73]What?
[138:29.05]I heard something.
[138:30.37]I'm hearing things.
[138:34.91]Should I get the magic sickle?
[138:38.77]Hold walk to climb anything.
[138:42.77]Oh, oh!
[138:46.28]Hold walk.
[138:47.02]What?
[138:48.42]Hold walk to climb anything?
[138:50.12]What do you think I'm... Walk is shift.
[138:55.24]I thought it meant like just hold walk.
[139:05.68]Oh!
[139:07.48]Now what do I... Oh no!
[139:09.34]Okay, I think I blew it.
[139:12.40]No I didn't.
[139:21.10]No, this shit just opened.
[139:26.40]Yeah, this is open now.
[139:33.64]Good.
[139:34.48]Yellow key somewhere?
[139:38.99]Get the crusties.
[139:50.31]Now what?
[139:52.07]These are open.
[139:56.98]Red keycard.
[139:58.34]Got it.
[140:07.37]New viewer here.
[140:08.07]Whoa, this guy's good.
[140:13.10]I know.
[140:14.50]Oh, I know.
[140:14.94]Alright, where's the red door?
[140:20.91]Red keycard, red door is all the way back, isn't it?
[140:36.20]This is Red Door.
[140:41.03]Red Door?
[140:42.49]Blue Door?
[140:45.20]Red Door?
[140:48.12]Who's talking?
[141:07.40]That just swung around me.
[141:08.74]New viewer here.
[141:09.48]I remember when that happened to me too.
[141:11.64]It was not fun.
[141:14.20]Oh, thanks.
[141:14.56]Appreciate it.
[141:15.30]Welcome to the stream.
[141:32.70]Wait, what about the door?
[141:34.05]There was a yellow door.
[141:38.21]What was that yellow door?
[141:44.79]New viewer here.
[141:45.31]Can this guy do a flip?
[141:46.51]Yay.
[141:46.97]Oh yeah.
[141:48.05]I've done it on stream.
[141:56.63]How do I open this?
[141:59.43]I know that means I can break it.
[142:05.30]I need to use the rivet gun.
[142:07.70]Lie.
[142:10.81]Oh, that's the rivet gun.
[142:13.67]Right.
[142:14.41]Thank you for that.
[142:20.78]Just extra ammo?
[142:24.14]Oh, there was extra ammo in that secret area.
[142:36.32]You know how I know people hate that?
[142:39.68]Because yawning is seen as one of the most obnoxious things to hear.
[142:54.13]Easy.
[143:12.38]What's this mess?
[143:15.58]Oh, red door.
[143:17.04]I need the red key.
[143:19.18]It's electrified.
[143:19.80]Am I gonna get killed?
[143:21.60]Electrocution?
[143:24.58]Artifact storage.
[143:29.66]Don't go in the ruins!
[143:32.66]Oh, well, I will.
[143:34.44]Don't worry, I will.
[143:41.10]He's
[143:49.66]Is that a person?
[143:50.42]I don't know.
[144:06.17]Let's go!
[144:08.30]Oh, there's nothing here.
[144:09.76]Wait.
[144:13.24]I got scared for no reason.
[144:18.48]What about that?
[144:19.66]This looks suspicious.
[144:34.51]Where am I going?
[144:43.35]It's just a cool secret.
[144:45.13]Look at that.
[144:49.73]Alright.
[144:53.57]Nice.
[145:09.60]It's very... I don't like how claustrophobic it is down here.
[145:23.84]They're gonna bust out of the jail cells.
[145:30.14]I know it's gonna happen.
[145:31.04]This happens in every video game with something at the end of the hall.
[145:34.39]Don't trust your eyes?
[145:35.41]Okay.
[145:35.83]I'm not gonna trust my eyes.
[145:36.73]I'm gonna run this way.
[145:37.39]I'm gonna leave.
[145:38.23]I'm gonna go home.
[145:39.19]I'm gonna leave home.
[145:42.01]I think I killed something.
[145:54.02]Did I just kill one?
[145:54.78]How many do I have to kill?
[145:57.29]Oh, at least they have a lot of health.
[146:03.59]Don't trust your eyes.
[146:05.87]That means I can walk through this.
[146:08.87]Oh, really?
[146:09.59]I thought that was going to be like, this is fake and you walk through the wall and this is the next part.
[146:16.12]How do I open this?
[146:23.24]Is there a switch to open this stuff?
[146:31.28]Ooh.
[146:31.78]Don't even need a switch.
[146:34.47]Got the mortar.
[146:41.03]Is he talking about the invisible enemies?
[146:42.33]No, I don't think so.
[146:44.13]I think he's talking about a visible wall.
[146:47.08]But we have different opinions on it, so that's alright.
[146:49.64]That's what I think it is, though.
[147:01.76]Very clearly, that's what it is.
[147:03.52]Alright, got the- Turn the visuals off and do audio alone.
[147:20.39]I don't think- that sounds like a fun game to me.
[147:29.23]Did my speed increase?
[147:31.43]I think I'm going faster.
[147:32.33]I'm looking for the- where's the red door?
[147:44.33]Up here?
[147:44.63]There it is.
[147:48.11]Turn the stream up and tweet your actions.
[147:56.25]Going down this hall now, guys.
[147:57.65]Going down this hall.
[147:58.64]I'm going down here.
[148:06.93]If I did that, I would tweet more than I've tweeted probably in the last five years total.
[148:23.02]Alright.
[148:23.50]It's invisible.
[148:24.44]It's invisible.
[148:24.94]Whatever it is.
[148:25.50]It's the invisible thing.
[148:26.22]Oh my fuck!
[148:41.53]Oh, that sucks.
[148:44.80]And they make the Burgah Boy pterodactyl noise.
[148:47.62]That, like... I can't even do it.
[148:49.56]You know the one.
[149:04.25]Knowing that those things are here... Oh, I hate it.
[149:10.93]Invisible enemies really invisible enemies I was gonna give you a game in 9.4.
[149:19.03]I
[149:46.99]Alright, we good?
[149:59.38]Am I safe?
[150:00.24]I think so.
[150:01.64]I gotta open this, though.
[150:06.49]Forklift?
[150:09.03]Let's get up there.
[150:09.77]How do I get back up?
[150:10.65]How do I get back up?
[150:17.15]Excuse me, the streamer asked you a question.
[150:19.35]How do I get back up?
[150:26.73]Oh no, it's the 5G tower noise.
[150:32.62]Alright, would you guys put your head... Let's say this is the 5G tower.
[150:37.64]Would you connect your forehead to the 5G tower's tip-top like this and stick it on there for 10 seconds?
[150:45.44]Would you do it?
[150:48.06]No, you wouldn't?
[150:52.97]But it's so safe, why won't you?
[151:15.96]You would get powers.
[151:17.98]Would you get powers?
[151:18.88]Alright, but when you do it... So, you have to hold it there for 10 seconds.
[151:35.21]But when you do, you own that cell tower.
[151:37.41]It's now yours.
[151:38.65]And any phone calls and anybody's plans that go through that, you get a month.
[151:44.60]That's what you get for, like, you get money a month, like, for anybody that uses that tower.
[151:48.68]Can I, like, get under here?
[152:06.53]It's tempting.
[152:08.37]I probably should have opened that right now.
[152:09.83]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[152:10.93]I should have done that.
[152:16.72]Oh my lord, holy shit, there's a million people!
[152:19.50]There's no way I was getting out of that one.
[152:36.78]Alright, fine, not your head, but like the tip of your tongue.
[152:42.51]Wait, would you just give it electrocute?
[152:49.83]If you just went, like, and just placed it on there for one second.
[152:57.07]I have not slid at all this whole time I've played this game.
[153:01.84]Okay, so I'm seeing a lot of, like, yeah, sure, sure, yeah, sure.
[153:14.10]Alright, well, the closer you get with your tongue, the louder the, like, gets.
[153:26.62]And you can feel, like, static electricity, like, pulling your tongue forward.
[153:30.78]Still doing it?
[153:38.05]Nope.
[153:40.51]Alright, I gotta get in a good spot.
[153:42.77]And I gotta get my mortar gun.
[153:46.41]I'm ready.
[153:47.55]Activated.
[153:49.43]How much money we talking?
[153:58.70]I'll tell you in a second.
[154:03.48]Alright, I'll tell you.
[154:08.15]So, how much money are we talking about?
[154:18.85]We're talking about all the data that goes through the cell phone tower.
[154:23.64]You get it as, you know, people have their cell phone plans.
[154:26.42]So you get a portion of whatever their cell phone plan is.
[154:29.75]Like, whatever data comes through that tower.
[154:31.69]How do I get this?
[154:32.43]Are you serious?
[154:42.92]Well, I can still use it.
[154:44.21]Look at the health.
[154:57.16]right well fine so here's the scenario you get you get 500 000 instantly but by doing that what you've just done is you've given yourself a reverse superpower which twice a year it will not this you don't know when two times a year you just violently your pants yeah you get a curse
[155:22.93]You don't know when?
[155:23.58]Two times a year?
[155:24.20]It's random on 365 rolled days.
[155:26.90]Could be any time.
[155:28.28]It could be one, two, twice in a row.
[155:33.68]You get $500,000.
[155:34.52]You missed the first part of the scenario?
[155:43.27]Well, don't worry, because none of it matters.
[155:49.29]There's a double.
[156:02.61]Red.
[156:03.58]Need red.
[156:04.56]Exit.
[156:05.80]What the fuck?

[156:36.72]Oh my goodness.
[156:38.46]We're still back here.

[156:48.77]Oh, century going up.
[157:05.62]Rifle!
[157:06.42]Who's still firing at me?
[157:18.11]You?
[157:26.96]Stop using the rifle for the small fries.
[157:28.66]It's one of my favorite weapons, and it's pinpoint accurate.
[157:36.43]Boring.
[157:36.81]Boring.
[157:37.59]Boring.
[157:41.00]That's one guy left.

[158:46.01]Tell me why.
[158:46.41]Did I say... I didn't say anything funny.
[158:48.93]Did I say something funny?
[158:50.25]When did I say something funny?
[158:51.31]When?
[158:54.25]I didn't say anything funny.

[162:42.54]Lost... lost progress.
[162:47.00]Oops.
[162:47.52]You threw it over the building!
[162:49.22]You threw it over the building!
[162:53.16]God damn it, I keep losing progress.
[163:18.23]Do I still have my shotgun?
[163:19.62]Yeah, I've got 16 bullets though.
[163:25.44]Where is it?
[163:26.32]Where are you?
[163:26.96]I heard it.
[163:28.24]I heard it.
[163:28.52]Where is it?
[163:29.78]Where the fuck is it?
[163:30.98]What's happening?
[163:31.72]Where is it?
[163:32.12]I don't know where it is.
[163:33.26]It's underneath me.
[163:35.18]It's underneath me.
[163:41.22]Oh my goodness.
[163:43.23]Where are we?
[163:43.63]Where are we?
[163:43.97]Where are we?

[163:44.75]Where are we?
[163:45.17]Where are we?
[163:45.59]Where are you?
[163:46.01]Where are we?
[163:47.40]Where are we at?
[163:48.30]Where are we?
[163:51.53]Where is it?
[163:52.07]Where are we?
[163:53.95]It's not gonna be behind me, right?
[164:04.06]Whatever, I have blue.
[164:15.67]Jeremy, don't do that again.
[164:19.81]Don't do that, you idiot.
[164:27.14]Why'd you do that, you idiot?
[164:43.05]Alright, where is it?
[164:44.71]Where is it?
[164:45.61]Where is it?
[164:46.05]I can hear it!

[165:14.96]I want to grab... Yeah, I knew there was something back here.
[165:21.19]Where are you?
[165:22.11]Oh, down underneath.
[165:22.67]Well, I don't care.

[165:28.83]I don't think... I don't... Oh my god, what did I just miss?
[165:32.16]There's something up there.
[165:32.82]Hold on, I'll go back.
[165:39.80]Good.

[165:56.14]Alright, what?
[165:58.79]What?
[165:59.07]How's that fair?
[166:00.95]I can't shoot you, but you can shoot me?
[166:03.73]Oh, you're a turret.
[166:04.59]Just go fast.
[166:07.87]Oh my god, they're shooting.
[166:08.79]Let's go.
[166:11.62]No, I'm dead.
[166:21.00]Alright, I gotta use the rifle here.
[166:30.42]One shot with the rifle.
[166:31.60]Find him?
[166:33.99]Wait, easy.
[166:34.71]It's right there.
[166:36.01]I got you.
[166:47.36]Hey, I just got here.
[166:48.16]How mad is he?
[166:51.06]Fucking... I don't even fucking want to talk about it.
[166:56.27]The game's fucking good, but like... Fucking god, man.
[167:00.01]I really don't get this fucking mad on stream, really.
[167:01.83]But if you just joined us, like, I'm fucking... See what I'm talking about?
[167:05.35]Like, what the fuck is that?
[167:06.53]See what I mean?
[167:09.06]I don't want to hate getting fucking mad like this on stream.
[167:11.02]I'm fucking furious right now.
[167:17.86]Whoops.
[167:18.58]What?
[167:19.03]Where am I?
[167:25.92]I hear the dogs running.
[167:31.50]Okay, one just bumped over a basket.
[167:33.09]Okay, I'm going to stay up here.
[167:34.95]They're everywhere.
[167:37.77]I see baskets being bumped.
[167:40.17]I'm dead.
[167:40.43]See what I'm talking about?
[167:42.03]Oh, I didn't save it.
[167:43.34]See him?
[167:46.06]Okay, I've got to stop being such a fucking weirdo.
[168:04.85]What is it?
[168:05.13]Seven?
[168:05.83]Eight?
[168:07.09]Where's the hunting rifle?
[168:09.27]Which number is it on?
[168:12.38]That's how we get rid of this guy.
[168:13.34]I can't believe this is the first time I've missed the whole game.
[168:29.57]I think they're all done.
[168:31.53]Looks like it.
[168:47.64]Where are they?
[168:48.66]They're in front of me.
[168:49.18]They're in front of me.
[168:49.74]They're in front of me.
[168:53.00]They're in front of me.
[169:01.17]Jump!
[169:02.95]Did they jump up too?
[169:03.81]I think they jumped.
[169:04.77]They're not up here, right?
[169:08.41]Okay.
[169:08.71]Alright, now we Mortar.
[169:20.41]Oh my god, I fell off.
[169:27.30]Oh, they almost made it!
[169:32.80]Got it.
[169:36.31]Oh, yeah.
[169:37.95]Now we got all kinds of health.
[169:43.67]That was everybody's Sunday, by the way.
[169:47.32]I know today's not Sunday, but I'm talking about, like, last Sunday.
[169:50.08]Did you have a good one?
[169:55.49]How was your Sunday?
[169:57.17]All hail the Great Thresher!
[170:03.53]So I have all the keys?
[170:07.38]Good save.
[170:09.68]Thanks.
[170:14.98]Alright, I need to get in that door.
[170:26.77]Do I actually get to leave them?
[170:30.25]Am I getting baited again?
[170:44.70]Really?
[170:48.04]Oh.
[170:48.90]Okay.
[170:49.26]Do they go down from here?
[170:59.83]Exit.
[171:03.09]What, uh... What am I missing?
[171:08.28]Red?
[171:08.72]Is there another red door over here?
[171:13.06]Press 0.
[171:15.92]What is this?
[171:22.18]You need to smoke a cigar?
[171:26.94]Why is my health not going down?
[171:39.62]Gotta go back in the other room.
[171:46.98]Alright, so what am I missing here?
[171:51.05]Is there another door?
[171:59.37]Uh, that's red.
[172:00.01]Oh, here we go.
[172:04.39]Smoking is bad for you.
[172:08.14]Okay, I thought it was one of those... Okay, I'm going.
[172:09.92]I thought it was one of those, um... Antlers.
[172:12.64]I'm just gonna call them antlers.
[172:14.32]Maintenance access is open.
[172:19.99]Maintenance is now open.
[172:26.39]Whatever that means.
[172:35.20]Uh...
[172:37.83]Alright.
[172:38.68]Is there... No turning... This is the beginning of the level.
[172:45.42]Do a flip?
[172:46.04]Alright, I'll do a flip.
[172:50.82]Right?
[172:56.16]One.
[172:57.41]Two.
[172:58.11]Three!
[172:59.31]Ow!
[172:59.57]My mouth!
[173:00.67]I hit my mouth on the fucking desk!
[173:04.27]Oh!
[173:05.95]Oh, fuck!
[173:06.53]I gotta go!
[173:08.48]No, I'm not.
[173:08.88]Let me wipe the blood off.
[173:10.34]I'm fine.
[173:14.04]There's a door.
[173:20.47]Ooh.
[173:21.91]Free stuff.
[173:22.29]Okay.
[173:29.23]Where do I go?
[173:41.00]I've lost my mind.
[173:43.58]Wait, what's this?
[173:46.69]Get in there.
[173:49.13]What is that?
[173:49.61]I have to go over this.
[174:06.49]Did I get it?
[174:07.63]I think I...
[174:15.11]I almost didn't get it.
[174:17.39]I almost didn't get it.
[174:21.43]I fell down and just... You can actually flip in this game.
[174:27.72]That's pretty cool.
[174:34.04]The infernal machine.
[174:35.60]That hurt.
[174:37.56]The fall broke your flashlight.
[174:39.92]Uh oh.
[174:40.14]That's not good.
[174:43.24]That's not good.
[174:44.18]I hate that.
[174:46.07]I'm not happy about this.
[174:48.07]Okay, I have to play the game like Daredevil.
[175:04.98]Save.
[175:05.56]Okay.
[175:13.69]I was in the middle.
[175:16.15]I was in the middle.
[175:16.73]Save.
[175:19.43]What the fuck is that noise, man?
[175:44.70]Stop shooting up from here!
[175:54.85]Red card.
[176:17.70]I can see again.
[176:18.44]Alright, good.
[176:20.88]Give me that shotgun.
[176:22.72]They want me to use the shotgun here, so I'm gonna use the shotgun.
[176:24.46]I'm gonna keep the shotgun equipped.
[176:28.37]No, you know what?
[176:28.83]I'm gonna... Two pistols.
[176:31.37]Let's actually... Let's actually use this the way that we're supposed to use it.
[176:34.25]Just be good at the game, so you don't waste ammo.
[176:39.08]I'm not good at the game, though.
[176:45.64]Too claustrophobic in here.
[176:47.20]To be good.
[176:55.97]New flashlight.
[176:56.61]Good.
[176:57.03]Nice.
[176:57.73]Awesome.
[176:58.17]Thank god.
[176:58.69]Working flashlight.
[176:59.55]Turn the cylinder where it is.
[177:00.71]Save the game.
[177:01.47]Whatever that does.
[177:05.51]Oh my god.
[177:06.15]My fucking hand.
[177:07.15]Hold on.
[177:07.47]I have to restart.
[177:08.79]There was no reason why there'd be a door open behind me.
[177:10.76]My brain hurts.
[177:16.94]okay where did you come from where did that guy come from shoot him I will terrible tracking Jeremy
[178:02.94]Am I still crouched?
[178:03.86]No.
[178:04.53]That's a long slide.
[178:18.95]Yellow key.
[178:19.71]Dammit.
[178:23.52]Well, looks like we're going down.
[178:25.40]Save the game again.
[178:26.32]Don't get killed by the blades.
[178:35.32]Sometimes you just gotta walk forward.
[178:37.50]Nah, I gotta walk back.
[178:42.92]Oh, he has to slide.
[178:58.93]I didn't slide.
[178:59.59]That's the problem.
[179:05.61]I did it without even looking last time.
[179:08.47]Right in the blades, almost.
[179:13.38]Jesus, that was... Was Jermuk good at TFT?
[179:22.80]Yeah.
[179:24.84]I played uh engineer and soldier and scout I was pretty good you know back in my heyday I would be number two or three or one on the top rag list
[179:59.93]Did I miss the yellow key?
[180:18.98]Did I not get him?
[180:30.52]Looks like it opens.
[180:31.38]This door opens elsewhere.
[180:32.56]Huh.
[180:32.70]Alright, well.
[180:37.05]Not in here.
[180:41.57]I guess I'm just gonna try to find the other room.
[180:45.19]Not in here.
[180:54.14]Not over here.
[180:58.46]Alright, let's go.
[181:02.64]I'm gonna try it.
[181:28.30]Machine gun is good.
[181:33.25]I can climb like this.
[181:37.63]Like this.
[182:15.24]I can climb if I walk.
[182:19.41]Don't- Don't shoot the buttons.
[182:28.08]There's Stan.
[182:43.29]It's not bad aim It has to be something like over here, is there a spot I could go in?
[183:29.51]Is there an opening that I'm just not seeing because it's blending in or something?
[183:38.55]I thought it said don't shoot.
[183:44.85]Oh, it's a joke.
[183:50.36]Didn't I shoot it?
[183:51.84]I'm confused.
[183:52.56]I thought I shot the damn thing.
[184:07.19]Bad aim.
[184:07.73]I shot it like 15 times!
[184:11.97]I get it.
[184:33.86]Go?
[184:34.44]Get back here.
[184:37.12]And you missed.
[184:37.64]No, I did not miss.
[184:38.68]I was just not... I apparently wasn't close enough.
[184:40.42]I shot it straight on.
[184:42.42]Go look at the clip.
[184:43.10]I don't even need... What am I doing?
[184:44.20]Bend myself?
[184:45.50]I don't.
[184:45.78]Look at the clip.
[184:52.94]That's un-fucking-believable.
[184:54.06]Just restart it.
[184:54.84]Oh my god.
[185:07.94]I just slipped off the fucking edge.
[185:11.91]Ready?
[185:16.03]Tell me again what I did wrong.
[185:17.84]What did I do wrong?
[185:19.30]I shot it a thousand times!
[185:43.35]Okay, I do not go back down.
[185:47.65]And this time you hit it.
[185:48.49]Whee!
[186:10.55]What the hell is this?
[186:44.85]Okay.
[186:47.53]Blue?
[186:48.23]No!
[186:48.75]Wasn't that going to be that easy, was it?
[186:50.51]Turn it back on.
[186:50.99]Turn it back on.
[186:51.37]Turn it back on.
[186:51.75]Turn it back on.
[187:00.92]When was the last time I saved it?
[187:01.76]Did I not save it?
[187:02.28]Yes, I did.
[187:04.74]Alright, turn it back on.
[187:19.61]What, did it homing missiles in my face?
[187:37.63]Damn.
[187:38.29]Okay.
[187:38.67]These guys suck.
[187:47.24]What do I wanna use?
[187:53.78]Jesus!
[187:57.49]I gotta just run down, I think.
[188:07.75]Oh my goodness.
[188:09.00]Alright, this is a... this is a hard fuckin' pole.
[188:13.94]Uhhh, I'll actually use this.
[188:14.96]I'm just gonna stay back here.
[188:22.89]Holy shit!
[188:38.48]Reflect him?
[188:39.31]I'll try it.
[188:46.11]Wasn't very good at this last time.
[188:56.52]What?!
[188:57.72]Come on!
[189:00.80]That's the way to do it.
[189:11.75]Just hold the attack button?
[189:12.73]That's not gonna work.
[189:14.17]Watch this.
[189:15.41]I'm dead.
[189:17.91]That one guy- I banned that one guy.
[189:19.69]Oh, we're doing it my way.
[189:49.54]You can't just ban people to solve your problems.
[189:51.84]Yes, I can.
[189:57.68]Whoa!
[189:59.52]Don't softlock.
[190:04.55]Why are you still alive?
[190:07.75]Is this guy made out of fucking titanium?
[190:10.15]I don't understand.
[190:20.18]I can ban away all my problems.
[190:26.38]Somebody says, hey streamer, you're an idiot.
[190:27.75]Ban him.
[190:28.79]Somebody says, hey streamer, I think you look ugly today.
[190:31.37]Ban that person.
[190:34.23]Hey streamer, ban that person.
[190:35.40]I don't even want to hear it.
[190:47.62]Wait, what does that do?
[190:49.08]Hold on.
[190:50.32]Can I get out of here?
[190:56.05]I just opened that.
[190:56.93]Can I get in there?
[191:23.00]Good shot.
[191:27.54]I love how they have the Combine voice that, like... Just delete that whole clip.
[191:34.04]It was not even worth watching.
[191:37.01]I could have done it better, but it's been... It's getting late.
[191:45.61]Is it fall damage?
[191:53.23]Oh, rivet gun.
[191:54.01]What the hell is down here?
[191:55.93]We found a secret.
[191:57.15]Back up.
[192:25.79]Hey, caught you streaming live for once.
[192:28.82]Welcome.
[192:29.36]What's up?
[192:29.70]Hope you're having a good day.
[192:32.66]First thought.
[192:33.16]What's your first thought coming in here?
[192:36.46]What's the first thing that you're thinking of right now?
[192:39.84]What's the first thing?
[192:50.69]Egomaniac.
[192:52.01]Alright, we got- I was supposed to go in the door.
[193:04.97]Is there a door over here?
[193:10.56]I guess there was.
[193:16.24]Not bad.
[193:37.94]Oh shit!
[193:47.65]I gotta start using mortars.
[193:54.69]I have so many of them.
[194:03.85]What's the river to ammo look like?
[194:12.76]Best weapon, my favorite weapon in the game.
[194:14.44]Got it.
[194:28.89]This door opens elsewhere, of course.
[194:34.16]Oh, I know where it opens.
[194:44.80]Get out of here.
[194:45.51]Get the fuck out of here.
[194:49.03]Anymore?
[194:58.32]Goats have gone mat- I figured there's gonna be one right there.
[195:03.80]This one's- I can hear them.
[195:24.84]Does that mean I'm gonna get the crossbow?
[195:30.79]I would hope so.
[195:34.31]No crossbow?
[195:44.84]Okay, back up to it.
[195:46.90]I've got the other key now.
[195:49.56]Let's get the hell out of here.
[195:57.70]There's a soap up there?
[195:58.34]It's all good.
[196:01.12]Alright, now if I remember, this one is down?
[196:02.78]Is this one down or up?
[196:03.70]I don't remember.
[196:08.82]This is the yellow one, right?
[196:09.64]No, it's down.
[196:10.02]Yeah, I know where it is.
[196:11.56]You're not gonna tell me, I know where it is.
[196:15.92]I gotta get... I gotta get back here.
[196:18.54]There, up...
[196:27.25]Alright, here we are.
[196:35.84]It's not worth using that.
[196:38.76]Alright, here we go.
[196:45.18]Just open a vault just in case I need to run.
[196:46.68]If I think I did that, this guy would have collapsed on me.
[196:50.85]This guy was sneaking up behind me.
[196:56.44]The hatch is open.
[197:13.01]So what?
[197:24.80]So what?
[197:30.93]Where am I going?
[197:33.23]Where's this hatch I'm looking for?
[197:39.09]Uh... The hatch is open.
[197:43.21]Is this the hatch?
[197:44.23]Down here?
[197:59.68]That looks like a hatch.
[198:12.95]Well, depends on what you mean by that.
[198:28.40]Holy shit.
[198:54.85]Save it.
[198:55.95]Oh, we got a boss now?
[198:57.01]I think I have a boss feeling right now.
[198:59.59]What do you guys think?
[199:01.75]Well, just the end of the level.
[199:13.58]That's the coke you did.
[199:22.40]What's the boss feeling?
[199:23.90]Oh, he's a fucking weirdo.
[199:27.96]Guy is dead.
[199:29.74]Completely dead.
[199:31.91]So dead.
[199:35.65]No reason to use that.
[199:36.93]Switch to the, uh, stick-
[199:54.53]Jesus!
[199:55.57]I didn't know this was a new room, was it?
[200:00.07]Press E on the computer.
[200:13.26]Don't have time to play with myself.
[200:19.26]You got me.
[200:20.58]Yep.
[200:21.42]You got me.
[200:22.60]You got me there, guys.
[200:29.32]I don't know what happened there, but I'm just gonna say whatever.
[200:31.36]I need the yellow key.
[200:36.80]Does this door open?
[200:37.48]No.
[200:37.82]The other door does.
[200:38.50]I know where that one is.
[200:39.36]I don't even have the sword anymore, do I?
[200:44.52]Damn it.
[200:45.08]Oh well.
[200:46.16]I thought that was an enemy.
[201:02.93]Alright, we'll do Mortar.
[201:04.43]It wants me to so bad.
[201:08.49]That's why it wants me to.
[201:11.30]Could've seen that coming from a mile away.
[201:21.93]Soap?
[201:22.69]I'll try it.
[201:31.47]Bad ending, thanks for that.
[201:34.85]Whatever.
[201:36.43]Maybe I should do motors in here.
[201:50.52]I wonder if I...
[202:08.24]Turns out, yeah.
[202:12.08]Soap's an insta-kill?
[202:12.90]Yeah, I know.
[202:13.30]It's just hard to move around with.
[202:17.04]Let me go over here first.
[202:21.88]OK.
[202:27.37]Go on.
[202:28.45]Take it.
[202:33.43]Time only moves it.
[202:35.15]Was that kind of moving?
[202:38.89]Super.
[202:40.28]Hot.
[202:40.38]Super.
[202:42.58]Hot.
[203:07.73]This is freaking me out.
[203:16.69]Fuck.
[203:16.93]Let's offer!
[203:20.47]Alright, just give me the big one.
[203:24.64]Shouldn't be wasting that on these guys.
[203:29.98]I don't need to do that.
[203:38.31]Holy fuck, that was a turret.
[203:40.64]Every time you kill one of the guys it sounds like you grunting.
[203:52.54]Eh, I guess so.
[204:17.77]Jesus, that scared the fuck out of me.
[204:19.13]I didn't mean to do that.
[204:25.11]Still can't open that.
[204:25.93]Something isn't right.
[204:28.05]Yeah?
[204:29.19]What's not right?
[204:55.64]Is this supposed to be Half-Life?
[205:10.21]Give me something good.
[205:15.13]Give me something I can use.
[205:22.59]Give me something good.
[205:28.59]What the fuck is going on?
[205:29.97]I'm gonna go... Up?
[206:10.35]Speedrunning this game would be so stressful.
[206:12.43]Holy shit.
[206:21.93]No, not really.
[206:22.53]On the hardest difficulty, though, I feel like it would be... That's why I'm just not cut out for that shit.
[206:28.59]Just not at all.
[206:35.29]I got the yellow key.
[206:38.30]Hardest difficulty is one hit, one kill for everybody?
[206:46.52]That's kind of scary.
[206:48.44]Wow.
[206:49.02]I gotta try that.
[206:58.40]I didn't get a chance to look at how cool that was.
[207:05.06]Stop.
[207:06.10]Stop it.
[207:18.66]OK.
[207:19.42]Slow down.
[207:28.12]Anything up here?
[207:30.16]Oh, shit.
[207:30.44]There's somebody over there.
[207:31.26]Wait.
[207:37.54]Jesus.
[207:38.76]Ugh.
[207:39.49]I could just... That sucked.
[207:43.09]That hurt.
[207:47.29]Red key.
[207:50.61]You overthought that.
[207:51.59]I know.
[207:59.27]Where have I not gone?
[208:01.63]Up there?
[208:01.97]And then there's a... Don't!
[208:10.96]I didn't!
[208:23.60]I didn't!
[208:29.88]Alright, let's keep moving.
[208:39.59]You save yourself.
[208:41.06]Save the game.
[209:06.08]What a reference.
[209:07.86]Somebody just said, Wild Woody.
[209:11.22]Wild Woody.
[209:13.30]That's un-fucking-believable.
[209:15.02]What a reference.
[209:24.19]The tank opens.
[209:24.85]Oh my god!
[209:32.90]There was somebody in there!
[209:36.66]It's mama!
[209:39.43]I'm dead.
[209:49.70]I'm gonna probably be here for a little while.
[209:53.74]Considering you can't fall off.
[209:56.30]That's all I do is fall off stuff.
[209:59.30]This was made to be a wall for me.
[210:08.39]Alright, I'm going to go with the Riveter first.
[210:18.56]Wow, what a
[210:51.84]Fuck!
[210:52.38]Oh, this is gonna be forever.
[211:30.38]Get it later.
[211:38.93]Wrong way.
[211:39.31]I keep predicting the wrong side.
[212:03.12]I fucking swear to god, Jeremy, please just jump on them.
[212:12.63]Come on.
[212:19.73]Barricade the door.
[212:21.03]No, I'm not using cheat strats.
[212:41.14]God damn it.
[213:09.34]I bet $10 he falls off again.
[213:11.12]I'd like to see your $10 bill.
[213:14.74]Wait, wait, whoa!
[213:17.90]That's to make sure you don't have to send any bids.
[213:19.14]Alright, let's go.
[213:32.87]I'm helping this person out.
[213:44.36]wacky scientists.
[213:48.82]I hear another wacky scientist!
[213:50.00]How about none of you?
[214:02.43]Let one of them stab you?
[214:10.37]No.
[214:22.29]Now you owe him... I didn't get any secrets?
[214:31.66]The Erebus Reactor.
[214:42.30]They're just waiting for me to come up.
[214:44.94]They haven't started their AI yet.
[215:08.12]What's this?
[215:09.10]Ooh, nice.
[215:18.94]Balls on parade?
[215:20.13]Is that what this song is?
[215:59.02]The microphone explodes!
[216:00.98]Fuck!
[216:01.36]Awww!
[217:03.00]God dammit, everything I can- Every time I fall down, I get a- Oh, every time!
[217:07.86]Fucking 5G, I can feel it already.
[217:15.78]I can feel the waves in my brain.
[217:21.85]Oh my fucking god.
[217:23.25]I can take a break, I'll pee.
[219:10.31]Yeah, I had to pee.
[219:11.09]That was the problem.
[219:14.33]So, also, something important to know.
[219:18.61]I gotta leave in about 20 minutes.
[219:22.23]I gotta leave in 20 minutes.
[219:23.27]So, Frility gave 10 community subs.
[219:25.49]Thank you, Frility.
[219:27.88]I gotta leave in 20 minutes.
[219:28.76]I gotta get auto food.
[219:31.50]And I wanna get it before they close.
[219:34.78]But we'll pick this up tomorrow.
[219:37.54]We're not done yet, though.
[219:38.32]We gotta leave in another 15, 20 minutes.
[219:41.66]This is awesome.
[219:43.04]I'm having a lot of fun.
[219:43.80]This is great.
[219:46.88]This is fucking fun.
[219:48.74]Really fun.
[219:50.80]What did I just do?
[219:55.53]Quick save, right?
[219:56.55]What's going on?
[220:07.20]What happened?
[220:08.92]Didn't know.
[220:12.69]Why is this the... I haven't saved it since back here?
[220:15.80]That doesn't make any sense.
[220:16.92]It's impossible.
[220:23.54]How would I have started the... I'm so confused right now.
[220:30.21]Wait, why is... What the fuck is going on?
[220:48.99]Oh, okay, so this is the very beginning of the level.
[220:52.06]Right, okay.
[220:52.78]Alright, no fucking around, here we go.
[221:19.23]I know it's a waste, but sometimes you gotta do it.
[222:16.53]Where the fuck are you and how you got a sight on me?
[222:32.44]You guys, your aim is better than anybody's I've ever seen in my life.
[222:57.80]What the fuck am I doing?
[223:33.25]I swear.
[223:33.89]Okay.
[223:34.65]I might have to take a break.
[223:36.19]I'm thinking about it.
[223:36.87]I might have to.
[223:37.59]I might have to take a break.
[223:38.61]I'm alive.
[223:39.17]I'm alive.
[223:40.09]I'm alive.
[223:40.43]I'm alive.
[223:40.93]Everybody quiet down.
[223:43.55]How do I get out from here?
[223:45.13]How do I get out from here?
[223:54.16]I can climb.
[223:55.10]I can climb that shit?
[223:57.36]What?
[224:30.85]Why?
[224:31.11]There's a mama back here?
[224:32.31]There's a mama.
[224:34.40]There's a super soldier.
[225:01.18]Jesus!
[225:03.16]They're raining hell over here!
[225:04.42]Where's the mama?
[225:19.69]Alright, I need ammo.
[225:21.77]Let's go.
[225:22.79]Don't step in the reactor, Jeremy.
[225:24.55]What are you, stupid?
[225:30.56]for no reason.
[225:31.14]I just freaked out.
[225:37.51]I saw you.
[225:38.19]Okay, guys, sometimes when you start losing track, you start losing track of everything.
[225:43.65]You start making mistakes.
[225:49.49]I shot like a round.
[226:05.35]Holy shit!
[226:06.33]What an aim!
[226:06.97]What an arm!
[226:07.87]Okay, I got a save right there.
[226:16.92]Holy shit!
[226:17.74]There's a lot of people over there!
[226:27.16]Why do I have to fight a... A mama is here?
[226:29.78]I have to fight a mama.
[226:30.84]I think that's it though.
[226:36.42]Two onions.
[226:36.92]Alright, I got two.
[226:37.84]Two onions.
[226:38.98]Three onions.
[226:39.48]Nope.

[226:47.25]I know it was a waste.
[226:48.32]Don't remind me.
[227:02.25]That's a keycard!
[227:03.95]Let's not.
[227:04.53]Help.

[246:10.90]Alright, I'm gonna call it here.
[246:13.62]We're gonna continue with this tomorrow.
[246:15.52]This will be what we start with.
[246:22.96]I believe we're probably... We're probably, what, like halfway through the game?
[246:37.34]Just about?
[246:38.10]Okay, cool.
[246:40.92]Just a bit more than half?
[246:41.80]Cool.

[246:46.44]I don't want him to close because he needs it.
[246:48.42]Gotta take care of it.
[246:50.96]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[246:52.54]Same time.
[246:53.68]We'll finish Dusk.
[246:56.60]Which I'm so glad.
[246:58.06]I'm so glad that I switched off of that sniper game to play this.
[247:11.86]But yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[247:13.20]I'm going to do the bits and the subs, hopefully very quickly.
[247:17.74]I'm leaving myself a good 10 to 15 minutes here to get to the store.
[247:22.64]But no, this is fantastic.
[247:24.30]Let's save.
[247:24.76]Just give a regular save right here.
[247:28.16]That's fine.
[247:29.04]Okay, whatever.
[247:29.68]It's the same damn thing.
[247:31.80]Alright.
[247:33.78]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[247:35.36]Thanks for watching.
[247:36.24]See you soon.
[247:43.60]Those of you that are sticking around, let's go through the bits.
[247:54.53]Let's go back!
[247:57.13]Back, back, back, back, back to five, six and a half hours ago.
[248:03.45]OG!
[248:04.01]Thank you, OGM here for the 300 bits.
[248:07.92]Hey, Jerma, just started watching both you and Star.
[248:10.02]Well, not just started.
[248:10.96]Hey, I started watching you guys back in 2011.
[248:13.00]That's around the same time I picked up TF2.
[248:17.04]From your casual gameplay commentators to the very list of wacky shenanigans you got up to, always kept me glued to the screen and even in stitches from time to time.
[248:24.92]That's a long fucking time.
[248:27.42]You've been a fantastic source of entertainment through many years and kept me smiling during hard times.
[248:33.42]Thank you for being you and never forget about the sheer joy and laughter you spread around the globe.
[248:39.38]Thank you for the incredibly nice message.
[248:42.16]That's a decade ago.
[248:44.80]I can't imagine somebody thinking the stuff that I say is still interesting ten years later.
[248:52.71]Thanks.
[248:54.83]That's all I can say, and I hope in another few years you think the same thing.
[248:59.41]Thank you.
[249:00.85]Don't feed his ego like this.
[249:02.25]We gotta bring him down.
[249:05.61]Seriously, thank you, OG.
[249:07.75]Uh, Ben faults 20 community subs.
[249:09.71]Huge amount of subs.
[249:10.67]Thank you, Ben.
[249:11.65]That was earlier.
[249:12.29]The chairman gave 5 community subs.
[249:16.12]For real, though?
[249:16.76]Thanks for the 250.
[249:17.10]Alright, Jerma.
[249:18.10]Since you turned down my suggestion for Stellaris, might I suggest Free Space 2 open?
[249:24.26]It's a really cool space combat game that has a lot of mods for it and adds new content.
[249:29.64]Uh, it's the first I've ever heard of it.
[249:31.98]Free Space 2 open.
[249:35.92]I'll look it up.
[249:37.86]See if it's something I want to play.
[249:42.54]Thanks for the suggestion.
[249:44.24]Free space.
[249:45.13]Not new space.
[249:45.89]Free space, too.
[249:47.81]Thank you.
[249:49.51]I'll take a look.
[249:52.27]Hey, Jeannie.
[249:53.37]Thank you, Jeannie, for the 500 bits.
[249:54.65]Almost there, chat.
[249:56.91]I'm not sure what that means, but you were almost somewhere.
[250:02.56]Thank you.
[250:05.32]Lost Fables gave 2,500 bits.
[250:09.08]25 bucks earlier.
[250:10.76]Thank you, Lost Fables, if you're still around.
[250:13.72]Jeremy, I've been watching your content for the last five years, and you're without a doubt the most creative and hilarious person I've ever watched.
[250:19.09]Wanted to give something back since I'm not a sub.
[250:21.63]Also not sure if you take game suggestions, but Titanic Adventure Out of Time seems perfect for you.
[250:28.01]Much love and continued success.
[250:29.29]Titanic?
[250:32.23]You play on the Titanic?
[250:33.07]Titanic?
[250:35.89]Alright, we're going to write a couple of these down.
[250:38.75]Also, if you have game suggestions, make sure you throw them not just on here, but make sure you put them in the actual recommended Discord channel.
[250:45.27]I check that all the time.
[250:46.99]I'm always scrolling through there, so if you're not part of the Discord, join the Discord too.
[250:50.84]It's open to the public.
[250:52.48]There's a sub room, but it's pretty much just completely open.
[250:57.76]I came in wanting to see Dusk.
[250:58.94]I got jubated.
[250:59.66]Well, you're going to be real happy because I'm playing it tomorrow too.
[251:03.89]I'm going to hopefully get to the end of the whole thing
[251:10.08]That clip is really, yeah, careful listening to that clip.
[251:12.02]This is one of the loudest things I've ever done on stream.
[251:14.61]But thank you, Lost Fables.
[251:17.37]Don't worry if you're not a sub.
[251:19.99]Thanks for watching regardless.
[251:23.63]Uh, Mr. McGee Guy.
[251:25.73]I don't even know why.
[251:26.33]I added Mr. to your name.
[251:28.76]That's not your name.
[251:30.22]Your name is McGee Guy.
[251:31.70]It's not Mr. McGee.
[251:32.76]I don't know why I said Mr.,
[251:37.60]Mr. One Guy.
[251:39.60]Thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[251:40.74]There's no message here, but just 1,500.
[251:42.48]Thank you.
[251:45.48]Dark Soul, thanks for the 250 bits.
[251:46.94]Finally done with my 70-hour work week.
[251:49.84]But by all means, take half of it.
[251:53.55]You worked 70 hours and made $5?
[252:00.33]That's not good.
[252:03.75]That's really not good.
[252:08.82]Was that like six cents an hour?
[252:12.50]That's not good.
[252:14.82]The children can eat their beds made from Amazon boxes.
[252:17.12]That's okay.
[252:17.60]But actually, thank you for streaming.
[252:20.03]Also, you're really cute.
[252:21.17]Please play Metroid Prime.
[252:22.29]I have like three days before I consume the GameCube.
[252:27.77]We had a couple of raids.
[252:28.53]We had...
[252:30.85]Tomato came in with a raid.
[252:32.70]Thanks, Tomato.
[252:33.88]Thank you if you're still watching from Tomato's stream.
[252:36.78]Thanks a lot, guys.
[252:38.62]Hope you enjoyed it.
[252:39.30]We'll be doing it tomorrow, too.
[252:43.70]And we also had a raid from Lazy Purple as well.
[252:48.48]So thanks, both of you.
[252:50.51]Appreciate it.
[252:57.31]Let's put the subs on the screen.
[253:00.36]And go to this.
[253:02.62]Hopefully the camera's not on.
[253:04.24]I gotta start wearing shirts.
[253:06.88]Just to turn it if I need to.
[253:09.14]Thanks everybody for your subs.
[253:14.75]All of you.
[253:15.99]You're all fucking incredibly special to me.
[253:21.98]There are a lot of you.
[253:22.78]Thanks.
[253:23.44]Seriously.
[253:24.04]Thank you.
[253:29.75]Nice boy.
[253:30.47]Haha.
[253:34.23]He called us special.
[253:35.51]The dev subbed to you.
[253:37.45]That's fun.
[253:40.77]Who actually made the game?
[253:42.05]What studio was it?
[253:44.94]It's really good.
[253:50.96]Who made this?
[253:54.60]Who made this game?
[253:58.55]Okay, this is how stupid I am.
[253:59.67]I went into Steam and I typed into the search bar, studio.
[254:04.81]Dusk, okay.
[254:05.43]Oh, it's just made by one guy.
[254:13.73]Really?
[254:14.01]It's just made by one guy.
[254:16.48]Well, probably not, but just David.
[254:23.26]Developer.
[254:24.46]David.
[254:26.55]So that's the David you guys are talking about.
[254:27.87]Oh, that's cool.
[254:29.23]Well, the game's awesome, so... Look forward to what you do in the future.
[254:41.04]But... Let's keep going.
[254:42.80]Because I've got to get out of here.
[254:45.66]Thank you, everybody, for all your subs.
[254:46.74]Seriously.
[254:49.16]And DarkSoul... I'm glad you don't have your 70-hour work week.
[254:52.35]Take a nice, needed rest.
[254:53.39]Take a couple days off.
[254:55.47]You deserve it.
[254:59.71]Frilitti, 10 community subs.
[255:01.13]Thank you, Frilitti.
[255:02.41]Earlier, about 30 minutes ago.
[255:03.73]I think I caught it, but I just want to say thank you again.
[255:05.38]It's a lot of money.
[255:08.00]Malto, thanks for the 500 bits.
[255:09.42]I have to say my favorite movie quote of all time is I'll be back from the 1985 The Germinator.
[255:14.81]It's not a bad one.
[255:19.19]It's alright.
[255:21.01]And then, ZionWASD, thanks for the 500 bits, I'm gonna start a riot.
[255:26.66]Halo is not better or equal to TF2 Xbox.
[255:31.04]Back me up against the PC oppressors.
[255:34.90]What?
[255:36.52]Halo... What is this?
[255:42.09]Halo is greater than and not equal to TF2's Xbox.
[255:46.59]Well, all the console Team Fortresses were terrible.
[255:50.15]They never received an update.
[255:53.23]That's not fair.
[255:59.03]There were still glitches in the game where you could insta-kill people with a melee attack in Xbox.
[256:03.59]TF2.
[256:05.29]You could store a crit.
[256:09.49]And just insta-kill somebody.
[256:10.53]And it was incredibly simple to do.
[256:16.90]I'll be playing Halo, though.
[256:17.72]We'll see if it's any good on PC.
[256:23.26]Alright, guys.
[256:23.98]See you tomorrow.
[256:24.58]Thanks for watching.
[256:25.12]I gotta get out of here.
[256:25.66]I gotta get to the store.
[256:27.10]Gotta get out of some food.
[256:28.84]Dusk is awesome.
[256:30.02]We'll keep playing it tomorrow and see if we can beat it.
[256:33.40]Good night.
[256:33.76]Take care.
[256:34.08]See you tomorrow.
[256:37.43]Goodbye.
[257:22.93]you
