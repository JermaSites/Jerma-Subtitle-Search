[00:39.24]Hello.
[00:39.52]Hey guys, hi.
[00:41.82]Welcome back to Dark Souls 3.
[00:49.69]Got a good one for you tonight.
[00:53.03]I made a second character.
[00:54.62]Majesto.
[00:55.02]Majesto.
[01:07.99]Not going to play with that guy at the moment.
[01:11.11]Still doing my first run through.
[01:22.89]Hold on.
[01:24.92]Let me switch it over.
[01:34.99]Oh, you guys didn't even get to see Majesto.
[01:37.73]Sorry about that.
[01:51.54]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[01:56.89]We're going to continue on our quest to complete Dark Souls 3 for the first time.
[02:09.82]See what I can only have a maximum of those things and only have 10 Yeah, I guess in one stack Alright, I'm gonna go back to where I was I
[02:34.98]Didn't I get a bone shard or something?
[02:36.82]Not yet.
[02:37.12]Can we expect some earlier streams soon?
[02:45.15]I'll be honest with you, probably not.
[02:50.58]This like 7 p.m.
[02:51.66]Eastern time is a real good sweet spot for me in regards to streaming.
[02:57.28]So you probably won't see, at least for the near future, any earlier streams.
[03:05.17]I'm sorry to say.
[03:09.79]So if I remember, there's a bunch of scary snow guys up here.
[03:12.75]I remember this beanpole.
[03:20.15]What's a beanpole?
[03:33.59]Whoa, another one's coming over here.
[03:37.75]Oh my god, the tree.
[03:42.96]Legitimately stuck in a tree, and then I got stuck between their two bodies.
[03:48.70]That was stupid.
[03:55.40]That guy came over and he just was a tree.
[03:58.76]Alright, well thanks for being a tree.
[04:10.80]Why does this tree even need to be here?
[04:14.42]This shit serves no purpose at all.
[04:18.04]It's the only fucking tree in the whole entire town over there.
[04:39.98]I gotta warm up a little bit here.
[04:41.07]This is not a great place to warm up when you play this game.
[04:43.37]These guys are crazy.
[04:44.57]Alright, ready guys?
[04:48.27]Ready?
[04:48.91]Find the one stupid tree in the entire zone.
[04:53.29]Found it.
[04:53.87]There's one over to the right next to it too.
[04:58.94]Tree wouldn't even be able to grow here.
[05:01.04]Nice immersion.
[05:15.03]Hey, look at this.
[05:15.55]Where's the soil?
[05:17.65]No soil.
[05:20.40]What about this tree over here?
[05:21.18]Where's the soil?
[05:23.28]It's just concrete.
[05:24.12]That don't work.
[05:24.62]Does this tree make sense?
[05:48.44]Game sucks.
[05:50.42]Game sucks.
[05:51.46]Game sucks.
[05:57.37]Like I don't want to fight these guys over here.
[06:05.73]I really want to get these dudes to walk at me.
[06:08.51]Come over to me, please, please, please.
[06:10.09]Okay, hopefully he can't see me through the wall.
[06:19.50]Well, that would be surely annoying.
[06:28.70]Ooh, he's not dead.
[06:30.18]Don't be a tree!
[06:31.28]Do not act like a tree.
[06:38.95]I seriously have to live with that much health.
[06:40.47]This area was not giving me this much trouble last night.
[07:06.10]to enter the Gungeon DLC?
[07:07.56]Not necessarily.
[07:20.38]Shit, we're logged on.
[07:35.90]Nope, forgot about this guy.
[07:40.44]I'm going to wrap around you.
[07:45.28]Hold on a second.
[07:47.12]Let me kill this tree bug.
[07:49.02]Tree bug?
[07:49.80]Jewel bug.
[07:50.60]See, I'm too busy thinking about trees.
[07:56.47]What is that noise?
[07:58.53]Who is this golem?
[07:59.31]I can see it like a little goblin.
[08:02.59]Listen to this guy.
[08:04.57]Where is he?
[08:06.84]Down there?
[08:17.21]If I can just avoid those guys, maybe I just will.
[08:32.04]Door?
[08:33.42]Is this a... no.
[08:36.29]That looks like a skip.
[08:38.57]I don't have it yet though.
[08:45.86]How many more of those do I need to get my can opener upgraded and whatever the hell this item is called?
[08:56.69]Oh shit.
[08:58.43]Oh shit.
[09:08.14]Oh, he saw me.
[09:09.28]Wow, there's three of them.
[09:11.96]Three dudes.
[09:18.79]Oh, no.
[09:19.69]This is not good.
[09:20.79]There's like six enemies here now.
[09:23.85]And they're all very dangerous.
[09:26.45]This might be a back-to-bed situation here, guys.
[09:33.13]Oh, yeah.
[09:33.69]See you later.
[09:34.19]I'm dead.
[09:39.81]Wait, there's an update to the game?
[09:52.33]Do I have to go this way?
[09:56.63]Or is there another place I can go?
[09:58.55]I feel like I'm just getting my ass kicked here.
[10:03.25]Maybe I should go to another area first.
[10:07.93]Because these dudes in one swing do about 35-40% of my health.
[10:13.09]For some reason I cannot seem to deal with them.
[10:25.66]That's better.
[10:41.14]Angry tree count.
[10:44.44]Forget the trees, man.
[10:46.58]Like, forget the trees.
[10:47.82]That's all I got to say.
[10:49.52]You know what I got to say?
[10:50.08]Like, forget about it.
[10:50.90]Instead of saying the F word, I'm going to say forget you.
[10:53.96]You know what I mean?
[10:55.38]Forget you.
[11:07.85]See, look at this guy.
[11:08.31]He's getting mad at the tree.
[11:09.11]He's swinging at the tree.
[11:21.37]What about armor?
[11:23.28]I'm pretty sure I have good armor for this.
[11:24.76]I wish he could hit his own guys with that.
[11:34.24]No!
[11:41.43]You're really gonna wall me?
[11:44.63]This guy can't even see me!
[11:48.35]Come on!
[11:48.97]That's not fair!
[11:51.47]He's just taking a wild guess at hitting me.
[12:00.65]Huh?
[12:09.26]Oh, you really... You running out of mana already?
[12:26.56]Fire Witch Armor?
[12:29.87]What is that?
[12:38.57]No, that's... Now I'm rolling real slow.
[12:41.75]This is going to have to come off.
[12:44.27]Interesting looking, but not practical.
[12:51.59]That's better.
[13:11.50]Yeah, I just saw Star started his second run.
[13:15.66]So what, like 20, 25 hours for his first playthrough?
[13:20.02]I think this character is currently at 14 hours, I think.
[13:23.14]So over the next 10 hours, I guess that's when you'll see sort of endgame areas.
[13:29.38]The only reason why I didn't run up here right away is because I saw this patrol and it scared me.
[13:41.51]But, you know, sometimes you gotta... Sometimes you gotta kill guys, right?
[13:47.91]This is not good at all.
[13:53.01]I wonder if there's another way to go.
[13:54.14]Because that way... It's pretty much just me dying.
[13:59.44]Oh my god!
[14:04.40]What?
[14:06.54]Nobody can do that.
[14:07.34]I don't care who you are.
[14:12.44]Jesus, will you stop fucking swinging the sword?
[14:15.36]You need to be an Olympian, dude.
[14:27.79]Somebody get that guy a contract.
[14:31.13]Unbelievable.
[14:42.15]Get away from magic guy.
[14:48.07]Yup.
[14:51.85]I really wish you both weren't magic guys.
[14:54.13]I don't want to get ugly on fire.
[15:06.16]That's not good.
[15:25.56]I tried to dodge.
[15:27.10]Y'all saw it.
[15:28.42]Y'all saw it.
[15:29.08]I got like, apparently I got stuck on the guy's dying corpse and I couldn't dodge through it.
[15:35.14]He was still, he was still among the living, I guess.
[15:50.93]Okay, he's gonna let me kill you, that's fine.
[16:06.10]That takes care of that.
[16:14.45]I'm not going to get swarmed by the patrol anymore, but there's another three-man group that's going to be these guys up here.
[16:23.33]Ah, they have to be in pairs of threes.
[16:24.59]Do they really have to be in a pair of three?
[16:26.29]I could go up there into the left, or I could... I'm going to go this way.
[16:34.46]Inside that room seems way too dangerous.
[16:45.60]Let's go back to the poison safari.
[16:49.40]Yeah, didn't you guys like the sightseeing and the poison safari?
[16:52.96]There's a bonfire.
[16:55.15]At least they're nice enough to give that to me.
[17:00.51]Man.
[17:21.44]Okay, that's... I'm looking at somebody changing the Jupiter emote to, like, another person's face.
[17:26.19]That's interesting how that matches up that way.
[17:42.78]Reduces frost.
[17:44.22]Probably gonna need that at some point.
[17:59.88]So every time I kill one of the bosses, are they gonna be sitting up here?
[18:04.72]I got a feeling that dude at the very end is gonna be like, yes, you've killed all my friends.
[18:10.35]Now you have to deal with me.
[18:12.19]Spectac, thanks for the two months, man.
[18:14.35]Welcome back.
[18:19.45]I need three more.
[18:41.19]Three more large titanites.
[18:47.69]Although, this thing... Right now, this is 160... 154, 74.
[18:48.75]115, 40.
[18:48.85]This thing also has a bleed.
[18:50.95]Better scaling.
[19:14.61]I'm going to give it a shot.
[19:15.39]I'm just going to put it on.
[19:16.53]Because, man, I have a ton of little Titanite shards.
[19:22.15]Hmm.
[19:23.67]Plus five.
[19:39.60]Is there really any pain and suffering for me to waste these right now?
[19:48.27]because I can't even spend them on this anymore.
[19:53.61]Could give it a go.
[19:54.49]It does have bleed, so... Is this poison?
[19:57.89]How have I not... I didn't even know that.
[20:10.41]So I'm poisoning people, sort of.
[20:18.64]I'm going to upgrade the Uchi Katana a couple times.
[20:22.78]And I'm going to use it.
[20:29.84]Because it's plus 3.
[20:32.28]149, 60.
[20:36.18]Let's give it a shot.
[20:45.03]I'm not going to use Large Titanite on it, though, yet.
[20:49.75]Because I feel like this has a lot more range to it.
[21:02.62]The one issue that I have with the little rotten booger knife is that you have to be real close.
[21:08.46]With this, it seems like it's a big slash in front of you.
[21:15.95]Let's see how it works out, huh?
[21:33.54]Yeah, pretty nice Jupiter combo, guys.
[21:41.19]So I came in through that door.
[21:42.47]Let's go this way.
[21:47.97]Proof of Conquered kept.
[21:54.56]Now it's a Covenant item.
[21:58.62]Covenant that I'm not a part of.
[22:05.18]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[22:11.40]Pagigallo.
[22:12.48]Pagigallo.
[22:13.26]Pagigallo.
[22:14.38]Thanks for the two months.
[22:26.70]It makes me laugh every time.
[22:30.06]That's it?
[22:30.38]Just a tiny little fading soul?
[22:32.48]Hey!
[22:39.22]It's good.
[22:41.13]It's pretty heavy damage.
[22:45.13]I hear something.
[22:46.65]Whoa!
[22:46.95]Alright, oh, there's the person I heard.
[22:52.71]Invisible people now.
[22:56.01]Is that everything?
[23:01.34]No, we can go this way.
[23:22.44]Three homered bones.
[23:23.48]Nice.
[23:28.54]Oh, and an undead bone shard.
[23:29.94]That makes me happy.
[23:31.14]Thanks for the tip.
[23:43.02]The Uchi Katana.
[23:51.49]Is that all I could do down here?
[23:52.63]I guess I could go all the way down the tunnel.
[23:58.36]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[24:03.48]James Fluke.
[24:05.10]Welcome back.
[24:05.85]This is the guy over there.
[24:06.71]See the eyes?
[24:07.09]This dude is trying to be sneaky and I'm going to catch him right now.
[24:15.63]Nice try.
[24:19.32]Nice try.
[24:26.02]Be wary.
[24:34.21]Nothing there.
[24:41.47]Look at all those eyes.
[24:44.95]That's a lot of eyes.
[24:48.25]Sure are a lot of frogs down there.
[24:52.17]Look at those smoke frogs jumping around.
[24:55.88]I hope they don't come up here, unless I fall.
[25:06.27]Sorry, looks like I gotta go down there.
[25:14.41]This is really scary.
[25:18.69]It's two swings.
[25:24.94]Let's see how many swings it is with this.
[25:26.24]Oh, shit.
[25:31.33]That's a great move.
[25:35.27]Oh, that is a fantastic move.
[25:38.63]Uchi Katana.
[25:39.85]Definitely.
[25:41.61]That's way better than the stupid boogie knife move.
[25:57.32]I'm running out of... juice.
[26:14.79]He got that dude.
[26:15.55]Yeah, this katana... was... at the very beginning of the game.
[26:20.44]Those of you that care.
[26:22.82]That's where you get it.
[26:23.84]There's a naked guy that has it at the very beginning next to the shrine.
[26:27.94]Like, for those that didn't see it that want to know where it is.
[26:37.72]This thing is a beast.
[26:41.27]And it's going to be my best friend, I think, for the remainder of the playthrough.
[26:54.62]Should've known it was gonna wrap around me.
[27:02.60]Whoa, there's somebody there.
[27:07.76]Shit.
[27:09.06]It's too dark to see you swing.
[27:14.93]Really?
[27:15.17]You hit me like in my big toe.
[27:26.23]Now, I'm not going to rule out the booger can opener.
[27:30.42]I'm going to keep it.
[27:32.24]Because it might be a situation where I need to swing faster on a certain boss or something, and I'll hold on to it.
[27:44.07]That phantom has just freaked me out like three times.
[28:02.55]Okie dokie.
[28:05.07]What's the one-handed version like?
[28:09.29]Not much different.
[28:10.17]I'd rather do more damage and hold it with two hands.
[28:20.30]I'll take a look out here.
[28:23.52]On the balcony.
[28:26.88]Head outside of the balcony.
[28:43.88]This area seems pretty large.
[28:45.76]Because I could go in the... Remember the cathedral with the three guys and I was scared of the three pair?
[28:54.97]That's a whole other direction.
[29:03.07]Secret.
[29:04.53]Secret.
[29:06.19]Secret.
[29:07.83]Yeah!
[29:11.26]Don't.
[29:11.92]Don't leave me.
[29:13.06]Don't leave me!
[29:16.90]Nice.
[29:30.21]Hmm.
[29:30.37]That's all that was in here.
[29:42.02]I'm surprised that's the only thing that's in this room.
[29:47.51]I mean, Twinkling Titanite's cool, but I don't know if that's secret worthy.
[30:01.85]I didn't even want to hit that guy.
[30:03.58]Good thing I knew who was coming behind me then.
[30:09.22]Oh.
[30:15.89]You guys are just kind of wrapping around everywhere Secret in a secret.
[30:27.33]Yeah, there was secrets and secrets in the other games Sometimes you get to a secret boom another secret inside the secret
[30:43.62]With the smoke, there's fire, right?
[30:44.80]Maybe there's another one.
[30:53.99]Look at that wall.
[30:56.13]It's begging for you to think it's a secret.
[31:05.94]Does banging on walls hurt your durability?
[31:07.58]Probably.
[31:10.98]I was gonna say, is that like a magic invisible dude?
[31:14.94]Yeah, it is.
[31:15.36]I want you to come over here.
[31:27.87]That was spooky.
[31:31.29]Where'd he go?
[31:39.93]Blood gem.
[31:44.17]Maybe I should infuse this thing with bleed.
[31:46.64]It already has bleed.
[31:47.44]Maybe I should make it super bleed.
[31:52.44]Maybe I will.
[31:54.36]Maybe I will.
[31:57.57]I'm not gonna rule it out.
[32:10.28]What is this?
[32:19.79]That was a human spider.
[32:22.91]Usually when games have spiders they don't make them fleshy humans.
[32:27.26]That was the creepiest enemy in the game so far.
[32:30.70]Blah.
[32:34.93]Monster ahead.
[32:35.63]Oh, he's pointing this way.
[32:37.79]I just saw the monster.
[32:39.24]Thanks for helping, though.
[32:46.44]Three green blossoms.
[32:48.54]I have 13 of those things now.
[32:50.28]Like, 14.
[32:55.35]I keep going that way.
[32:56.39]I'm just going to peer up here.
[33:10.75]Is it already up this way?
[33:18.22]Yeah, it was.
[33:18.64]That's where I started.
[33:21.94]So I'm going to take a look over here.
[33:31.21]Another swamp.
[33:35.85]Let's hope there's no monster in here, like a giant one.
[33:38.07]I can deal with spider people, but not giant monsters.
[33:50.05]I bet this is going to say pointless.
[33:54.36]Huh?
[33:55.12]It's a hole.
[34:02.80]It's a cave over here.
[34:05.69]Thank God it's not poison.
[34:08.75]Is that a cave?
[34:10.78]Whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[34:13.12]Is that the person I killed?
[34:13.90]Oh, there's like slug people here too.
[34:16.44]There's spider people and slug people.
[34:23.46]Oh, dog.
[34:25.94]Those are the worst.
[34:27.16]They are so horrible looking.
[34:32.68]The ribcage and... Look at this slug dude over here.
[34:36.64]That's not a cool slug.
[34:38.00]I don't like this one.
[34:38.78]That's not a cool slug.
[34:44.76]Ugh.
[34:49.81]He's not a... great heal.
[34:53.57]No, he's a miracle.
[34:58.13]This dude looks like he might have been the king of the slugs.
[35:01.98]He's obviously dead.
[35:04.46]Goodbye.
[35:10.60]One more spot over here.
[35:31.43]More green blossom.
[35:34.44]Hopefully I never have to buy that ever again.
[35:36.84]I have so much of it now.
[35:42.72]Wow.
[35:45.22]What's going on with the sky?
[35:46.26]Alright.
[35:55.41]Anything down the railroad tracks?
[35:58.43]Doesn't look like there is.
[36:00.43]Just death.
[36:16.43]Yeah, I did want to have a slug emote, but then I think I ran out of emotes.
[36:26.37]I guess we go down into the bonfire.
[36:32.44]Kind of an odd place for a bonfire.
[36:37.78]I'm going to upgrade the katana again.
[36:42.32]I also got another thing to burn, didn't I?
[36:50.06]Take it easy, Narwhal.
[36:51.58]Thanks for coming up.
[36:57.26]But Kitana, really actually enjoying this thing a lot.
[37:03.69]Looks like an infusion.
[37:17.90]Crystal, fire, blessed, refined, deep.
[37:33.60]So, hold on.
[37:34.44]I guess I'm a little confused.
[37:35.32]So, raw gem gets rid of scaling, but it increases the base damage.
[37:44.07]This turns this into a magic dealing weapon.
[37:48.85]This gets rid of scaling and makes it a fire weapon.
[38:00.47]I don't know.
[38:03.51]The Jupiters are criminals.
[38:24.74]Distant Manor.
[38:28.76]Three different bonfires here.
[38:32.38]I have a feeling I'm going to be here for a while.
[38:46.09]How did a person die in here?
[38:47.19]Alright.
[38:56.02]What was following you?
[39:00.32]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[39:05.73]Thanks a lot, ghost food.
[39:07.65]Welcome back.
[39:09.11]For the two straight months of your five dollars.
[39:16.35]Don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run.
[39:17.97]Wait for me.
[39:19.65]Wait for me!
[39:20.13]Woo!
[39:38.31]Did not expect that.
[39:40.31]Pontiff Knight Gauntlets.
[39:44.21]Gonna have to see what those are, aren't we?
[39:53.33]Poise Drops.
[40:00.85]Things really aren't that great.
[40:05.37]Those things actually kind of suck.
[40:09.54]Game sucks.
[40:18.54]Oh, I got so greedy and he fucking skewered me.
[40:21.58]I just wanted to kill him in one hit.
[40:28.64]Did he seriously just dodge backwards to do that again?
[40:32.58]Oh my lord.
[40:36.10]I really do love that that's the first time I've seen that guy do that move.
[40:39.78]And I've fought him probably like 10 to 12 different times.
[41:00.70]Ow.
[41:06.31]Anything else?
[41:13.88]Oh, wow, what a good view.
[41:15.30]Hold on, I gotta write that.
[41:20.16]Uh... Hope.
[41:36.36]Uh... Fuck hope.
[41:49.16]Oh no, it just says hope.
[41:50.86]Hope.
[41:52.50]See the... Alright, so you fight that guy, you come across, you're like, oh man, that was so tough!
[41:56.78]What's this?
[41:58.16]Hope.
[41:58.78]Yeah, of course!
[42:00.12]I have hope!
[42:00.88]I'm gonna hope!
[42:02.53]It's gonna get like 2,000 thumbs up.
[42:11.88]You don't deserve this.
[42:14.90]See, like, I like that one.
[42:15.86]You don't deserve this.
[42:17.04]Dang, you know, that's... Yeah, I don't.
[42:19.40]You're right, I don't deserve this.
[42:37.58]Another bonfire.
[42:43.36]There's so many bonfires here.
[42:45.24]Is this like a new area?
[42:46.14]Yeah, it is.
[42:51.81]One, two... One, two, three, four bonfires I've gotten in the last like 30 minutes.
[42:57.07]And I have no idea which one of them I'm supposed to be at.
[43:01.23]I guess I'm going to use this one.
[43:05.96]Might as well just keep going the direction I'm going.
[43:07.78]And if I have to turn around, I have to turn around.
[43:09.34]But remember, this is an exploring stream.
[43:14.11]We are just gonna explore.
[43:27.26]Jesus!
[43:32.83]That scared me more than anything in the whole game.
[43:38.39]My heart hurts.
[43:46.72]Hold on.
[43:47.74]I seriously need a second.
[43:48.74]That was the scariest thing, the biggest jump of the whole game.
[44:01.27]Is he gonna do this too?
[44:03.40]Please don't scream at me.
[44:04.26]No.
[44:06.70]Only one of those enemies screams directly in your face as loud as it can.
[44:12.88]That one guy.
[44:14.92]Game sucks.
[44:19.01]Unfortunately, like, I feel bad for people that are kind of just joining the stream and hearing me say that.
[44:24.46]Because they're probably just like, this game sucks.
[44:27.26]Fuck you, you suck.
[44:30.61]So that's just a little bit of a joke we're pulling over here on the channel.
[44:34.99]Now in the chat, and in the group here, we're just a little bit of a prank, pulling a prank on people.
[44:52.39]That's locked.
[44:53.05]Did I miss anything else?
[44:53.99]Can I open this?
[44:54.87]I can't, no.
[44:55.37]That's the locked one.
[44:58.15]Let no stone be unturned.
[45:03.44]You know what this means?
[45:05.32]This means that something really bad is about to happen.
[45:09.08]Out of this door.
[45:11.20]Hmm.
[45:13.23]Really?
[45:13.59]Thought you could get me, didn't you?
[45:27.25]I don't like that noise.
[45:32.87]I don't like this area either.
[45:34.03]It scares me.
[45:35.77]It's too scary.
[45:39.92]Oh, it's him doing that.
[45:41.16]Stop it.
[45:52.53]Pointless, I guess.
[46:16.35]200 viewers just joining.
[46:17.23]His official opinion on Dark Souls is... Hold on.
[46:19.59]Can't... Can't talk.
[46:20.59]He just burnt me.
[46:22.79]He's got... Did I just get branded to death?
[46:34.42]Okay.
[46:44.95]I guess.
[46:50.13]He took my maximum health down so low from doing that?
[47:03.62]At least it'll look cool.
[47:07.78]Dude, I hope the brand is like a skull.
[47:13.00]You know what I mean?
[47:15.46]I'm gonna, like, pull my pants down and moon the mirror and look underneath, down, facing.
[47:19.61]I'm gonna moon the mirror and go down and look through my legs to see what it looks like.
[47:25.03]God, I hope it's, like, fucking barbed wire.
[47:27.05]You know what I mean?
[47:27.51]It's gonna happen again.
[47:34.60]I gotta, like, pay attention here.
[47:40.24]Oh, shit.
[47:40.74]Okay, I gotta...
[47:43.22]Am I gonna have to fucking samurai this dude when he walks in the door?
[47:45.32]I feel like I'm playing Metal Gear.
[47:58.91]I'm leaning against the door.
[48:00.17]Here he comes.
[48:11.96]We just walk in the door.
[48:18.12]Just me looking at him is taking down my health, by the way.
[48:21.26]Just realizing that now.
[48:24.40]Okay, I didn't know that.
[48:25.64]That's not cool.
[48:33.68]Can I get it back?
[48:36.88]Barely.
[48:38.99]Shit.
[48:41.30]Got some new gloves though.
[48:47.88]He was shimmying as fast as he could.
[48:50.22]Guy hiding over here or something.
[49:03.69]God, don't do that!
[49:09.76]Why?
[49:10.40]Do they have to do that?
[49:14.77]Does it have to be that loud?
[49:16.37]Shit.
[49:33.88]I'm gonna land on that guy.
[49:53.67]I need to, like, do a splash through.
[49:55.59]It's not going through the cage.
[50:04.08]It kind of is, actually.
[50:05.28]It didn't go through?
[50:09.62]Come on.
[50:14.54]Okay, what the... What are you doing, man?
[50:19.09]Could I please get my sword to go in rather than forget how to swing the sword when I get close to him?
[50:28.05]That's not what I wanted to do.
[50:35.75]Okay.
[50:38.74]Okay.
[50:40.62]Alright.
[50:41.82]We're alright here.
[50:43.10]Oh, boy.
[50:49.80]Five Fading Souls in that guy?
[50:53.75]Cool.
[51:00.23]Is there a jailer key that one of these guys eventually is going to give me?
[51:02.89]That would be nice.
[51:05.89]I'm very nervous here.
[51:24.04]Where's the key?
[51:27.97]Something's going to happen.
[51:28.73]It's going to say beware of left.
[51:30.53]Yeah, I figured so.
[51:31.69]I figured as much.
[51:45.55]Drink the juice.
[51:54.92]Oh no, I thought he was a regular dude.
[51:59.00]I'm okay.
[52:14.48]Old sorcerers.
[52:15.24]Let's take a look at some of the gear that I just picked up.
[52:20.82]Let me move a little bit.
[52:21.82]Let me move this.
[52:32.52]It's like magic defense stuff.
[52:35.44]How much of a dickhead am I going to look like in this?
[52:36.90]I look like an old paper boy.
[53:05.62]No, I got something else too.
[53:12.66]Did I get something new here?
[53:14.60]Pontiff Knight Armor.
[53:20.98]It's a pretty decent magic frost.
[53:23.41]Oh, I could probably use that here.
[53:25.79]Some frosty son of a bitches here, you know what I mean?
[53:35.49]There they are.
[53:39.53]I'm content right now with how I look and how I feel.
[53:48.80]Let's keep going.
[54:02.79]Okay.
[54:06.36]I hear a person walking.
[54:11.67]He's in the cage.
[54:16.79]Shit.
[54:18.59]It'd probably be better if I could just open the door and hit you.
[54:30.22]What do your arms go through?
[54:34.66]I might just kind of not care right now.
[54:36.98]Actually.
[54:40.99]You want to cheese me, then I'll cheese you too.
[54:43.99]That's the game you want to play.
[54:45.03]This is so dumb.
[54:56.14]Who's going to win the punch you through the wall strategy?
[54:58.92]Is it going to be you or me?
[54:59.86]I won.
[55:03.00]I won.
[55:05.85]Well, that might have been worth it.
[55:07.04]What is that?
[55:13.70]Great magic shield.
[55:14.90]Is that a sorcery?
[55:17.60]Greatly reinforced left shield with magic.
[55:22.61]Hmm.
[55:26.65]Sorcery, though.
[55:29.11]Turns out it wasn't worth it really at all, actually.
[55:30.77]Okay.
[55:38.21]So that's the point of coming all the way down here.
[55:39.59]Felt like I was rolling a little slower there.
[55:52.03]Seems to be back to normal now.
[55:54.34]I hope.
[56:01.12]I gotta go back upstairs.
[56:08.12]Is magic cool in this game?
[56:09.82]Seems to be very powerful.
[56:11.90]I made a sorcerer.
[56:13.84]Just to mess around for like 10 minutes in the starting area.
[56:19.00]The first boss.
[56:20.94]Remember that first boss that I fought, guys?
[56:23.06]He was, I mean, he was pretty difficult.
[56:24.89]Just like in the first time you're playing the game, trying to learn the movesets and everything.
[56:29.77]I killed that first boss as sorcery.
[56:34.79]Pretty much with my eyes closed.
[56:36.41]That's how easy it was.
[56:38.84]What was that?
[56:40.70]It does a ton of damage early.
[56:43.40]And you can just... It's so good from what I played in the first, like, 20 minutes.
[56:48.72]Who knows if it, like, really starts to scale back.
[56:52.19]But it didn't seem like it.
[56:58.37]Let me out of here.
[57:03.40]Where's the bird?
[57:06.02]I hear a bird, but I don't know where he is.
[57:15.18]Damn.
[57:32.89]Felt like that was the best strategy!
[57:35.27]Don't!
[57:36.01]Don't!
[57:38.80]Oh my god, look at my health!
[57:43.35]I have like a thumbnail of health.
[57:48.05]Oh my god.
[57:49.21]Give me my health back.
[57:51.24]Oh my god.
[57:54.36]Please give me my health back.
[57:59.20]Wow.
[58:05.28]Ah.
[58:13.08]Out of Estus flasks.
[58:14.78]That guy's in such a bad spot.
[58:16.24]Hopefully I don't have to do that again.
[58:17.32]I didn't even know there were this many of you down there.
[58:51.30]I really like that move.
[58:52.24]The katana is incredible.
[58:58.56]What is in there?
[59:01.41]Oh, that's a dude.
[59:02.27]That's a dude in the corner.
[59:04.11]It's a baby's face.
[59:07.33]He's making bird noises.
[59:10.91]I don't know.
[59:11.25]I don't know if I should go over there.
[59:12.45]Holy shit.
[59:16.36]Should I go over to the bird noise baby?
[59:22.23]Is he hostile?
[59:23.81]I can't target him.
[59:24.59]I don't think he's hostile.
[59:34.68]He's not hostile.
[59:35.90]Or at least I can't target him.
[59:41.10]Whoa!
[59:59.63]Alright.
[60:01.21]Well, it was nice to meet you.
[60:03.75]Does he have something around his neck?
[60:10.61]I don't know, but I'm not going to sit here and wait to find out.
[60:13.19]I don't have any health.
[60:19.97]And that opens this door.
[60:21.41]I don't want to go down there at the moment, I don't think.
[60:44.77]He's gonna scream.
[60:47.13]There's the key.
[60:50.57]I can open locked doors now.
[60:56.11]Okay.
[61:01.14]Where were some of those?
[61:01.84]Might be worth just opening them if I'm here.
[61:06.96]Might as well do it, right?
[61:13.87]Go back downstairs and wrap around.
[61:31.45]I actually like this place.
[61:32.41]I don't know.
[61:34.11]It's scary, weird.
[61:36.56]It's different.
[61:38.64]It's ugly.
[61:43.02]Where was one of those cells that I could unlock?
[61:49.21]Bonfire.
[61:49.75]I don't want to use that right now.
[61:54.23]I want to just go get these items for free.
[61:56.49]The locked doors.
[62:05.36]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[62:11.04]Ramboned.
[62:13.34]Welcome back.
[62:13.78]Thanks a lot.
[62:15.12]Four months in a row.
[62:19.47]That is a lengthy time period.
[62:27.71]Much love, dude.
[62:32.75]Here we go.
[62:34.60]What?
[62:37.56]You're telling me that I can't open this with the key to the cells?
[62:40.68]It doesn't open that cell door?
[62:48.53]Take this key.
[62:50.39]Even though the thing that's locked inside of the zone you're in... There we go.
[62:56.91]That doesn't look like I can...
[63:06.85]I'm not going back now.
[63:14.01]Strange area, though.
[63:15.25]Hold on.
[63:16.76]Phantoms, man.
[63:19.80]The phantoms.
[63:23.96]Those things... Every time I see one.
[63:33.71]Don't I already have one of those?
[63:36.60]Lingering dragon crest ring.
[63:39.58]Bellowing dragon crest ring.
[63:41.94]So these are both sorcery things.
[63:43.32]Greatly boosts sorceries.
[63:49.57]Too bad I'm not that.
[63:57.67]I could bone it up.
[63:59.89]I may bone it up.
[64:01.71]These guys are different enemies that I haven't seen.
[64:06.05]I think this guy's gonna, like, wake up.
[64:15.32]What the fuck is happening to me?
[64:18.28]What's happening to me?
[64:24.28]This guy's chasing me.
[64:25.54]Come on, it is.
[64:28.78]Oh, boy.
[64:29.26]I wish I could close the door behind me.
[64:43.48]Open it, open it, open it, open it, open it.
[64:45.35]It doesn't open.
[64:49.41]There's a bone, there's a bone, there's a bone.
[64:53.87]I just locked up.
[64:54.41]Ugh.
[65:14.54]Oh my god.
[65:15.52]This place is worse than a horror game.
[65:30.54]Thanks a lot, Vic.
[65:42.18]Vic, I believe you are the first new subscriber of the night.
[65:45.90]So, welcome.
[65:47.12]Thank you.
[65:48.30]Maybe there was one before you.
[65:52.55]I have enough to upgrade this another time, so we're going to do it.
[65:56.75]This is now the same as this.
[66:01.65]Yeah, so take a look at the differences.
[66:03.95]This is plus five.
[66:04.67]This is also plus five.
[66:07.85]This one is 154, 74.
[66:09.53]This one is 172, 75.
[66:11.10]So this one just does more damage.
[66:18.32]And it's actually better to use.
[66:20.60]It's got more spread.
[66:21.62]I don't know.
[66:22.66]The booger weapon might have to go away forever.
[66:26.80]Cart crash?
[66:27.43]Did I see your name pop up?
[66:37.64]I don't think I remember seeing your name pop up, Cartcrash.
[66:43.17]Cartcrash.
[66:44.37]Cartcrash.
[66:46.25]Cartcrash.
[66:47.35]Cart.
[66:48.11]I'm neglecting Endurance a little bit too much.
[67:13.01]But now this thing is on the same level that the element was, so it's gonna be good.
[67:31.44]I think that's it.
[67:32.22]I can go back to like baby land.
[67:41.29]Subalert skipped some people, did it?
[67:47.59]It didn't even pop up.
[67:49.07]What?
[67:51.43]What?
[67:54.13]That's not cool.
[67:56.41]Hold on, let me just... I want to take a look at that for just one quarter of a quarter of a second.
[68:02.84]Twitch is having issues with subs showing up today.
[68:05.14]Aww.
[68:05.72]Aww.
[68:07.43]Well, that last one just showed up.
[68:09.99]I've seen at least three of them show up today.
[68:11.55]I'm going to look at my... Oh, shit.
[68:17.17]The light didn't just crash the game.
[68:24.90]One second.
[68:25.80]Let's see if I remember...
[68:37.25]Yeah, so Vic.
[68:40.76]Raging Rawburn.
[68:42.54]Not Bird.
[68:43.30]Yeah, there was like... Wow.
[68:45.84]At least three.
[68:47.64]I don't remember Not Bird either.
[68:52.30]Well, thanks, guys.
[68:58.93]Sorry, you're not getting... showing up on the screen.
[69:06.35]Sub 20 minutes into the stream.
[69:07.36]Maybe it resolved itself.
[69:09.16]I don't know.
[69:09.44]Because that last one just definitely showed up.
[69:17.66]Got skipped on a resub, but you still love me.
[69:21.70]I just changed your words.
[69:23.32]You said like you.
[69:24.19]I changed it to love.
[69:32.67]It's happening a little last night too.
[69:33.79]Huh.
[69:35.11]Well, whatever.
[69:37.89]Sorry, dudes.
[69:47.09]Listen to me, son.
[69:49.97]I'm your dad.
[69:50.91]Destroy him.
[69:56.13]Whoa!
[70:08.96]Seriously, don't tell me you're going to brand me through the wall.
[70:14.11]I'm dead.
[70:16.09]I understand the need for... There's nothing I can say.
[70:23.47]Don't drive angry.
[70:24.43]That's all I'm going to say.
[70:25.67]And I'm about to.
[70:28.94]But nothing feels worse than getting hit through what theoretically looks like 16 inches of concrete.
[70:37.13]I'm... But, hey, who am I to say anything?
[70:58.80]He's gonna kill me again.
[71:02.45]I looked over, somebody said that like, I said, alright, I'm looking over at chat and I see somebody said that I know somebody's real life name and I was like, I don't, who, real life name?
[71:10.63]I turn around and there's this branding guy in front of me.
[71:26.60]Goodbye.
[71:33.42]Now I have to take an ember.
[71:44.07]Do you know I'm going to fill up my health bar?
[71:47.53]I just took an ember.
[71:48.49]Well, that one worked.
[71:57.83]Quack of Dawn.
[71:59.77]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[72:01.80]I guess it seems to be functioning again.
[72:03.74]Because that's two that I saw in a row, yeah.
[72:09.14]Thanks, Quack.
[72:10.66]Thanks, Quacker.
[72:17.47]These enemies.
[72:18.71]Like... I can't even... I can't even begin to believe...
[72:29.47]How do I get this health back?
[72:31.21]I just have to stand still for like a few minutes?
[72:39.45]Come on.
[72:41.15]Thank you.
[72:41.58]Oh, fuck off.
[72:54.58]Slam right through you guys.
[72:55.64]You want to get slammed?
[73:03.23]Where was the actual way to progress through this area?
[73:05.87]Down here, right?
[73:11.22]Definitely wasn't where I went.
[73:13.58]Because the baby spider person is over here.
[73:17.06]I think it might have been down here.
[73:24.35]Didn't I get down here and I was like, oh, what is this?
[73:32.16]There's another one this There are three of those guys down there I didn't even see them I didn't even see those dudes Look at my health.
[73:50.78]Oh, it is not a good thing It's not a good thing
[74:00.02]It's gonna happen again because there's three of them in this room so by the time I kill one of them I'm gonna have Literally a fingernail of HP like I said Lock on to him so I can drop
[74:41.54]I got his robe.
[74:43.28]The baby is down here.
[74:45.02]The mean baby.
[74:45.86]There were two different babies.
[74:46.96]Keep that in mind.
[74:48.32]There was a nice baby and a mean baby.
[74:50.14]There's the mean baby alien lizard dragon person.
[74:57.33]The question is, do I go in there and fight him?
[74:59.39]Is it time for just... Alright, I'm going in.
[75:02.91]I'm going in.
[75:03.97]I'm going in.
[75:12.95]I did.
[75:15.61]Easel cube, thanks for subbing, I just did, I got him.
[75:19.09]That was for you, easel cube.
[75:22.28]Welcome to the family.
[75:25.56]Hey, welcome, man.
[75:28.10]You know, I like to say this, my subscribers, yeah, we're all family, you know what I mean?
[75:36.72]One big happy family of potentially hundreds of people.
[75:43.10]I had a big family.
[75:44.22]That's what I would tell people.
[75:45.50]Big family reunions.
[75:56.93]I freaked out down here, so let's see what's actually here.
[76:01.70]This door doesn't open from this side.
[76:06.89]Looks like we can go down another level.
[76:09.07]Let's try to do that.
[76:13.05]Explore this area.
[76:21.53]Shit!
[76:22.41]Alright.
[76:24.01]Well, we're not going to get the jewel bug right now, unfortunately.
[76:28.19]That's a new weapon, though.
[76:29.19]Tailbone spear.
[76:34.51]Where is it?
[76:36.43]Is it in this room?
[76:41.18]What?
[76:44.06]Where is it?
[76:48.36]Must be down.
[76:52.26]That noise is so horrible.
[77:00.89]Yeah, okay, this is where I need to be going.
[77:02.35]Because then I keep going down, down, down, and I end up opening the door from the other side, probably.
[77:05.61]So let's just keep going down.
[77:09.97]That kind of looks like a boss area, maybe.
[77:14.45]I don't know.
[77:16.34]I'll check to see if there's time before dinner.
[77:27.22]Hate that sniper.
[77:34.52]Okay, they need only two hits.
[77:42.59]They need two hits with the Uchi-Gadana.
[77:48.63]It's good to know that those guys only need two hits with the Dolce-Gabbana.
[77:56.64]The Uchi-Gadana.
[77:57.50]I'm out of safe room.
[78:00.18]Listen to me, son!
[78:02.68]I'm your dad!
[78:08.53]Hey Suplex, thanks for seven.
[78:16.76]I need to make sure I put one down to a member.
[78:18.52]Yeah It's up there we go
[78:37.30]Wow!
[78:40.47]Phew!
[78:49.13]No!
[78:49.87]No!
[78:50.31]No!
[78:51.11]No!
[78:51.59]No!
[78:52.37]No!
[78:52.97]Ugh!
[78:54.95]I even knew it was there.
[79:02.62]And the thing just...
[79:05.94]I even knew it was there.
[79:07.08]This has a fucking thousand health.
[79:13.95]Like seriously, I'm just going.
[79:15.83]I'm running by these fucking morons.
[79:17.81]Alright, good luck.
[79:24.52]Nice grab.
[79:26.90]Shit for brains.
[79:30.73]No, I can't do it.
[79:31.37]I can't run by this.
[79:33.23]I'm having a really bad realization right now.
[79:35.09]I cannot run by these.
[79:35.89]I mean, it looks like I am, but I don't think I can.
[79:47.25]And I sort of don't even... I forgot where I'm going.
[79:49.02]Shit.
[80:00.79]These guys cannot be staggered when you hit them.
[80:04.65]They just swing in a hundred different directions.
[80:08.23]Like every other fucking enemy in this dumb game.
[80:10.48]Game sucks.
[80:11.40]Game sucks.
[80:12.32]Game sucks.
[80:30.81]Now I have to remember which way it was.
[80:41.83]Maybe it was not this way.
[80:42.94]I think it was the other way.
[80:54.54]Driving angry again?
[80:55.40]I know.
[80:58.37]But sometimes you have to
[81:03.33]I guess it wasn't this way.
[81:11.03]Yeah, because it's not this way.
[81:12.25]Because there's no aliens.
[81:17.74]There's no baby aliens this way.
[81:19.22]Can I jump out the fucking window?
[81:27.84]Oh yeah, I can.
[81:33.09]I can't jump out the window.
[81:34.05]No, no, no!
[82:03.48]No!
[82:06.16]Oh, my nose is itchy.
[82:10.93]Oh, boy.
[82:13.43]My phone's ringing.
[82:15.09]People are texting me.
[82:18.93]Lots of things are happening right now that I don't want to have happen.
[82:25.81]Ugh.
[82:27.21]What's going on with the nose?
[82:29.52]Any nose doctors in here want to ask me some diagnostic questions as to why my nose is... Hold on a second.
[82:36.48]Hold on a... Stop fucking texting me!
[82:45.89]Oh my god!
[82:47.23]Is this an emergency?
[82:48.45]This is... I am getting a thousand texts right now.
[82:56.24]What is going on?
[82:58.36]Did you fall in?
[82:59.08]I don't even care right now.
[83:19.89]I'd rather not.
[83:20.75]I can come back later.
[83:21.63]I'm more confident.
[83:32.81]What is that?
[83:36.49]Oh, hi guys.
[83:39.48]Am I playing Granny's Grey game?
[83:41.08]Is this guy going to start pushing me?
[83:42.18]I feel like you're in the wrong part of town.
[83:47.30]He's got a gun!
[84:05.36]Hoping that's gonna hit more than one of them, but it's not.
[84:20.71]There are a lot of you down here.
[84:22.20]Why wasn't I invited?
[84:31.66]I am invited.
[84:32.22]Or maybe I'm not invited.
[84:34.34]Just kind of showing up.
[84:41.73]More subs got unorsened?
[84:45.23]Oh, what the heck?
[84:49.36]Did you guys hear anything about that guy that was walking around?
[84:51.62]Yeah, I saw a guy.
[85:01.37]start having that conversation.
[85:09.64]I saw a guy.
[85:10.44]Did you see that guy walking around?
[85:15.65]That's so funny.
[85:17.69]They might as well have just said, hey, have you guys seen insert name of protagonist here?
[85:23.53]No, I haven't seen it.
[85:25.13]Actually, I have heard about insert protagonist here.
[85:32.97]I gotta be careful.
[85:37.08]Who knows?
[85:42.70]Alright, while I'm safe for a second, I'm going to... Hold on, I wanna see.
[85:48.61]I wanna say... See how many people got not shown.
[86:10.97]Uh, yeah, they're not even showing up in my, like, the recent, I'm getting some subs, like, new subs are coming through.
[86:16.05]Actually, you know, some of them are, Law, LawBears, Danny Desh, Danny Desho, Danny K. Desho.
[86:30.20]Twitch sucks.
[86:31.28]Twitch sucks.
[86:32.30]Twitch sucks.
[86:38.72]Twitch is awesome, man.
[86:40.63]Twitch is fucking awesome.
[86:41.79]I can't stay that.
[86:43.65]What is in here?
[86:53.28]He's right in front of me.
[86:54.24]He's right in front of me.
[86:55.08]Whatever it is, he's in front of me.
[86:58.42]Alright, where's my escape route?
[87:00.00]Where's my panic route?
[87:01.80]Back in this room.
[87:10.93]Is this his food?
[87:11.59]How far of a drop is that?
[87:26.62]There are rats down there, too.
[87:28.34]Uh...
[87:34.05]Should I just try to sneak by him?
[87:36.55]Wasn't there a Mickey Mouse episode that was like this?
[87:38.57]When him, Donald, and Goofy had to sneak into a castle and there was a sleepy giant and they had to steal some cheese and bread and shit?
[87:46.31]Oh, wait a minute.
[87:46.77]I'm just describing the Disney version of Jack and the Beanstalk.
[87:58.02]Can I get by him?
[87:58.84]Come on.
[88:00.60]Those stairs, are those stairs, do they lead up to anything?
[88:04.70]I can't see from here.
[88:06.24]The stairs go up, but they end into a wall.
[88:22.03]Don't break the bridge!
[88:22.83]Don't break the bridge!
[88:25.47]Don't break the bridge!
[88:32.55]Pickaxe?
[88:42.84]Pickaxe?
[88:50.14]Sea scaling for strength?
[88:53.37]Galvanize?
[88:54.05]Temporarily boost stamina recovery speed by sheer force of will, which an old miner needed to get through the day.
[89:03.21]What?
[89:04.65]Oh, I so badly wish I could use this.
[89:11.45]Well, let's see what it looks like.
[89:16.99]Oh, this thing is amazing.
[89:21.43]Whoa.
[89:22.29]Hey, Starcraft, easy on the fucking emotes.
[89:28.42]Holy shit, dude.
[89:31.91]You just made a Rubik's Cube with my emotes.
[89:41.56]Damn.
[89:42.44]That's cool, but... Unfortunately, I don't have... I'm not... I'm doing this.
[89:50.09]Donald was terrifying in that cartoon.
[89:51.79]He goes crazy.
[89:52.91]Oh, yeah, he does!
[89:54.63]He goes... Doesn't he start to look around?
[89:56.17]He sees people as food.
[89:58.48]Like, Goofy turns into a turkey, and Mickey turns into, like, a piece of bread, and he, like, tries to bite his face.
[90:03.19]Because he, like, grabs his, like, duck bill or something, and, like, squeezes his head or something like that.
[90:07.71]I gotta watch that again.
[90:08.47]What was it called?
[90:08.99]Uh-oh.
[90:12.91]Huh?
[90:13.23]It's a monster.
[90:14.09]Uh, treasure.
[90:20.58]I feel like these might be reversed.
[90:21.68]Is it the same guy?
[90:26.36]Somebody, I feel like, might be trying to fuck with me here.
[90:37.39]Okay, this one is breathing.
[90:39.63]Did you see that?
[90:42.61]I think that one was breathing.
[90:43.69]Yeah, look.
[90:46.08]This one's breathing.
[90:47.02]I wonder if that's a chest I should open.
[90:51.56]Is this one breathing?
[90:52.20]No.
[90:57.42]Old cell key.
[91:03.11]Oh, God.
[91:05.99]Uh...
[91:08.21]Okay.
[91:16.38]Shit.
[91:17.30]No.
[91:18.62]Nope.
[91:19.90]Alright.
[91:21.28]What am I doing?
[91:23.64]I was hoping he was going to have the Mimic kill everybody.
[91:26.33]Come on.
[91:28.41]Is he going to attack?
[91:28.95]Is he going to hurt everything?
[91:29.63]He's going to attack everything, right?
[91:31.57]The Giant will kill him.
[91:33.63]Watch this.
[91:36.01]The giant's gonna fucking kill everybody.
[91:37.37]Nope, I'm going this way.
[91:42.07]There's a giant rat in here.
[91:47.28]Holy shit.
[92:12.52]There's so many people.
[92:18.87]Alright, let's see what it was.
[92:27.11]Dung pile.
[92:28.79]Oh, good.
[92:35.38]I died for a dung pile.
[92:37.66]You never know though, it could have been a secret item.
[92:42.51]I'm sorry, I did not expect it.
[92:43.73]Okay, I opened up the mimic because I figured maybe I could have the giant kill them, right?
[92:49.12]Hold on a second, let me just insta-die.
[92:52.76]Fucking god.
[92:57.83]There was a method to that madness.
[93:00.71]Sometimes plans change, right?
[93:04.59]Plans changed a little bit there.
[93:07.56]I saw that the mimic chest was there.
[93:09.02]The rats are everywhere.
[93:11.22]Petrify.
[93:12.54]Remember, I'm going through how fast my brain was just processing information.
[93:16.36]Here we go.
[93:16.72]Ready?
[93:17.86]Mimic chest.
[93:18.38]Open that up.
[93:18.90]Maybe the rats will be, or the alien bugs will be killed.
[93:22.04]Petrify.
[93:22.98]Watch out.
[93:23.35]Going to turn into a stone.
[93:24.09]Turn into a stone means you die instantly.
[93:25.77]Run.
[93:26.21]Wait a minute.
[93:26.53]I haven't gone this way.
[93:27.13]I didn't think I could go that way.
[93:28.07]Let's go this way.
[93:29.33]Into the mimic.
[93:30.07]Mimic is still behind me.
[93:31.39]Room full of giant rats this time.
[93:33.55]That's how much I couldn't process all that information.
[93:37.06]Nobody could.
[93:40.15]And then I got stuck into all the burners.
[93:45.89]You know what the curveball really was?
[93:47.47]Is that second, like, door.
[93:49.39]That I could go in.
[93:50.09]The little cave.
[93:51.85]And now I'm going to slowly try to get back there.
[93:57.84]There's a method to my madness, guys.
[94:01.74]Guys, I swear to God, there's a method to my madness.
[94:49.35]That ended up being very much worth it.
[94:52.22]So, glad I did that.
[94:57.86]Here's the I am alive room.
[95:01.04]I remember this.
[95:01.64]That doesn't open really.
[95:18.66]You think you can fuck with the... Uchi?
[95:21.36]The Uchi Katana?
[95:30.17]It's a good move with the Katana.
[95:31.55]Does a lot of damage and covers a ton of ground.
[95:42.05]I don't even need to go over there, do I?
[95:43.77]There's a little place for me to drop down.
[95:45.42]Okay.
[95:55.26]I want as much health as I can get here.
[96:07.59]I wonder...
[96:11.09]Kinda have to wake him up.
[96:19.02]I was just guessing.
[96:26.60]That was a wild guess.
[96:35.15]Fuck more rats.
[96:47.03]Katana is pretty good.
[96:49.41]Pretty good.
[96:52.53]Pretty good.
[96:59.17]Your pulse is 130 right now?
[97:01.22]It's not even game related?
[97:03.38]Oh, boy.
[97:03.84]Maybe take a break?
[97:07.70]Go get a glass of water?
[97:11.58]Sit down?
[97:12.22]Take a rest?
[97:14.06]Be careful with that.
[97:19.97]There's another mimic chest back there, but I'd rather just hang out back here.
[97:26.96]Kill the rats that are plaguing this area.
[97:31.28]Alright.
[97:45.01]The one thing I need to be concerned about is the fact that how many of those branding dudes are here.
[97:53.09]I counted at least four.
[97:55.47]At least four.
[98:01.60]One.
[98:02.62]Two.
[98:03.06]Three.
[98:06.46]I don't have any rats on me.
[98:09.78]This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[98:11.08]Really.
[98:12.60]Really.
[98:14.78]This is going to suck so bad.
[98:19.30]You haven't slept in a while.
[98:21.22]I would go take a sleep.
[98:23.08]Go take a rest.
[98:26.67]There's plenty of mods here right now.
[98:30.19]Take a load off.
[98:46.23]Yeah, I just saw seven.
[98:49.13]I think there are seven of them here.
[99:01.20]This is just way too dangerous.
[99:07.50]It doesn't do, like, any damage.
[99:10.52]115 damage.
[99:12.89]It's nothing.
[99:13.75]At least I got one.
[99:14.39]I got one.
[99:18.07]Is it two or one?
[99:18.79]Looks like it's just one.
[99:27.18]Get out of line of sight.
[99:30.98]These remind me of the Bloodborne doll enemies.
[99:36.15]The frenzy ones.
[99:37.65]Where if they look at you, it just ruins your whole game.
[100:06.12]I'm gonna take my time with this room So sorry this shit Sorry, this might be very slow and potentially boring, but I am going to take My time because I don't want to have to do this again
[100:26.00]There's so many of them.
[100:27.02]I wonder how fast my HP would go down if I just ran out there swinging.
[100:34.37]Do you two seriously have to split up?
[100:35.87]You don't have to be together.
[100:36.57]Actually, they might not be terrible.
[100:40.91]There's one.
[100:42.77]I can just run up and get that one guy.
[101:02.42]Shit.
[101:05.82]Moment of truth.
[101:10.32]This is not good.
[101:15.56]Not good.
[101:20.68]Hopefully it's just this one.
[101:21.72]They didn't all aggro behind him.
[101:23.00]Alright, I'm good.
[101:31.18]That was sort of nerve-wracking.
[101:37.97]I wonder what the rhyme or reason is to how long it lasts.
[101:40.63]Because see how it's like randomly ticking?
[101:42.27]It's just like, oh, okay.
[101:44.14]Here we go.
[101:44.62]I don't know.
[101:46.40]I don't know what the criteria is for it, but... I think that's all of them.
[101:59.97]At least in the immediate area.
[102:01.81]And they're my souls.
[102:13.91]There's one more over there.
[102:14.81]One of those babies.
[102:23.45]Is there more than one in here?
[102:26.99]My luck, I'll get dropped on by another one behind me.
[102:31.23]That one's bigger?
[102:31.81]They look different.
[102:35.30]That one's blue.
[102:37.00]There is one right next to me.
[102:40.86]Ooh!
[102:44.53]I didn't even see him.
[102:46.25]Oh, God.
[102:50.97]Okay, here comes like the magician one.
[103:15.08]Another one over there.
[103:24.92]This reminds me of Bloodborne.
[103:27.61]These enemies.
[103:28.31]This like weird dreary awful area.
[103:30.21]This is Bloodborne.
[103:33.99]Give me more areas like this.
[103:35.15]This is going to be hard.
[103:37.93]I'm going to have to kill one of these guys in one fell swoop.
[103:41.56]It's going to have to be the guy on the... Oh.
[103:47.59]Okay, I don't think that guy got pulled.
[103:50.67]I think it's just this... Wow.
[103:52.57]I hope this item was worth it, because I don't think there's anything else really in here.
[104:18.10]Tailbone short sword, and what was the reason to come in the room?
[104:22.30]Profaned coal.
[104:27.77]I don't know, but hold on.
[104:31.05]One more of these guys in here.
[104:42.02]I believe that's a blacksmith item.
[104:50.42]Tailbone spear.
[104:53.60]Tailbone short sword.
[104:55.60]E and E. Unleash dragon.
[105:03.45]What?
[105:03.59]Let's see what it does.
[105:08.73]Looks like paper mache.
[105:12.76]This thing is fast.
[105:16.84]Let's see.
[105:17.18]Let's unleash the dragon.
[105:24.47]That's cool.
[105:27.39]This thing is screaming fast.
[105:34.69]But it is not the katana.
[105:51.20]I don't want to be too overzealous, because I believe right next to me looks like a skip of some sort, or maybe two different skips.
[106:00.33]I don't know.
[106:01.99]Dead guy.
[106:03.41]Get ready for the scream.
[106:05.55]Nope, no scream.
[106:09.17]There's somebody in that room.
[106:17.89]Oh.
[106:19.31]There is somebody there.
[106:23.56]Wait till he cools off.
[106:24.54]If he does, then I'm gonna charge him.
[106:28.57]Come on.
[106:29.73]Cool off.
[106:39.17]Pretty much have this entire set these guys have on.
[106:41.27]This one's locked.
[106:51.12]There is a scary guy in here, so...
[106:53.96]Alright, scary guy.
[106:57.76]It's a cross, dude.
[107:04.93]Just gotta keep him locked up.
[107:05.97]Is there a point in that?
[107:23.32]I mean, why would you have this room if there wasn't a reason for any of this?
[107:39.96]Hmm.
[107:43.84]I guess it was just a pointless room.
[107:52.22]Another side to check.
[107:53.76]Wait, this is the one that I... Ember ahead.
[108:06.72]Ooh.
[108:07.47]That means I can get more stuff in this shop.
[108:11.01]I'm so conscious about anything right now.
[108:14.29]Be wary of resignation.
[108:17.75]What the hell does that mean?
[108:28.69]What is it?
[108:29.97]Reduces consumption of FP, but also lowers HP.
[108:33.97]Got another one of these rings.
[108:38.51]I already have the bleed resist ring on.
[108:45.54]A lot of the rings in this game are caster rings.
[108:51.74]Let's see.
[108:52.82]Look at the rings that I've found so far.
[108:56.37]One.
[108:57.23]Two.
[109:01.49]Three.
[109:02.47]Four.
[109:03.47]Five.
[109:06.47]Six.
[109:07.89]I mean, does this count as like seven?
[109:11.34]I feel like a sorcery would be really fun to play.
[109:14.92]Looks like they really, really upped how interesting you can use spells in this game.
[109:38.08]Alright.
[109:41.48]Need... Careful concentration.
[109:47.02]Careful concentration.
[109:50.22]I look like I'm getting into something dangerous.
[109:57.71]There's a guy... There's a big guy over there.
[110:05.45]Is that a guy?
[110:06.01]Or is that a bush?
[110:08.87]Profaned capital.
[110:11.27]That's a guy.
[110:11.71]Yeah, that is a guy.
[110:12.39]That's a guy.
[110:17.93]I am just... I've gone through three zones now.
[110:22.48]I've kind of... Harry Potter Land had really hard enemies, but... I mean, I don't know.
[110:28.54]I'm probably going to die here.
[110:36.70]He actually hit me with that.
[110:43.47]Oh, got ya.
[111:11.63]You're still alive!
[111:12.61]What?!
[111:19.69]What?!
[111:31.54]At least a couple of WoWs would need it there.
[111:33.96]That didn't make any sense.
[111:34.86]75 and then 13.
[111:36.14]I hit him in his, like, wings.
[111:42.79]It's a bonfire.
[111:50.34]It's a bonfire right there.
[111:53.62]How do I get across that?
[111:57.38]Can I jump that?
[111:59.12]Hold on.
[112:02.74]Uh... Hold on...
[112:10.09]It looks like maybe I have to go all the way around because I can see the bonfire.
[112:13.43]It's right there.
[112:16.92]Jump for it.
[112:17.50]There's a ladder, but I don't want to do this right now.
[112:25.96]Falling might do a lot.
[112:26.97]I don't have very much health.
[112:28.03]I'm going to take the safe route.
[112:40.76]This is a ladder right here.
[112:41.92]Thank God.
[112:51.81]Please tell me I can, like, fall and wrap around.
[112:53.49]Yeah, there it is.
[112:53.95]Okay.
[112:57.69]Stretch out?
[113:00.55]What?
[113:01.01]Are you serious?
[113:04.34]I wanted to stretch out.
[113:05.56]Ah, the fresh...
[113:09.77]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[113:13.99]Doggy H. Thanks for the two months.
[113:18.36]I can actually see you.
[113:21.26]I want to get PvP invaded and just do that.
[113:29.67]Just lie on the ground.
[113:33.55]Anything else up here?
[113:35.05]Just let me light this.
[113:44.66]I have another Estusk shard.
[113:57.35]Alrighty.
[114:02.59]I'm going to go back to town.
[114:08.78]Profane capital.
[114:09.94]See, like we... I went a completely different direction.
[114:14.61]This looks like the next area.
[114:16.37]I didn't find a boss here.
[114:17.33]I don't know.
[114:35.36]A lot of things to crush as well.
[114:42.05]Do I have enough Titanite to keep going with the
[114:46.16]The Uchi.
[114:48.94]No, I need six.
[114:55.49]Do you sell stuff?
[114:58.29]Give coal.
[114:59.17]Ah, I just picked up that coal.
[115:01.11]Yeah, take it.
[115:03.37]Where did you happen upon this coal?
[115:06.06]This is much too dark.
[115:08.72]I see the abyss in it.
[115:11.95]Yet a smith I remain.
[115:14.57]But your fight is for the flame and for your fellow kin.
[115:20.44]Just like mine.
[115:21.86]A cursed fate this may be, but hope remains.
[115:26.68]Does it not?
[115:29.21]So what did that do?
[115:29.97]Gives me more options.
[115:36.79]Hollow gem, blood gem, dark gem, deep gem.
[115:42.67]More blood.
[115:43.29]Uh, 33 to 38.
[115:47.37]That seems not that great at all.
[115:56.07]What does a hollow gem do?
[116:13.02]I don't know.
[116:22.51]Okay.
[116:22.99]I have another thing to burn so I can get plus five.
[116:37.88]Now that should be much more potent, thankfully.
[116:40.13]And I'm still embered, so I'm fine.
[116:44.77]Where's the lady they are?
[116:49.47]Very worth a take.
[116:51.72]I'm going to get vigor and endurance to 25.
[116:57.96]So I need like 20,000.
[117:03.52]I don't think using these will get me there.
[117:08.53]No, I definitely don't.
[117:10.91]I'm going to get me to like 10,000 maybe.
[117:19.67]I have something to give to you.
[117:20.89]Alright, what do you got?
[117:22.29]What's new?
[117:43.02]She now sells Titanite Shards.
[117:49.43]Undead Legion gear.
[117:56.05]That really didn't unlock much.
[117:59.23]Besides the Titanite Shards, which I guess that's kind of a big deal.
[118:02.19]Can you get infinite?
[118:03.03]Yeah, infinite.
[118:06.43]Now, large Titanite Shards would really, really be cool.
[118:08.95]Because I really am in need of those right now.
[118:16.83]Okay.
[118:18.20]Goodbye.
[118:22.78]I'm going to go back to the manor.
[118:25.04]Because this... Or maybe I should go back to here.
[118:30.02]Yeah, I'm going to go back here.
[118:33.94]I feel like one of these areas... I'm just progressing way too far for my own good.
[118:57.44]So, this is the manor.
[118:59.06]Going down leads to the dungeon.
[119:01.78]Going back this way leads back to... Let's peek down here one more time.
[119:05.96]Because there is the inside of the castle.
[119:11.27]Yeah, I'm gonna go there.
[119:11.83]I'm gonna go back to the castle.
[119:17.91]Because I remember freaking out about the way... I'll go back to Hogwarts.
[119:28.69]Yeah.
[119:29.53]If I go up this way... It should lead me... To something.
[119:49.28]Didn't go in here.
[119:49.98]Yikes.
[119:55.44]No!
[120:24.69]Scary enemies.
[120:30.88]Another one right... dead guy?
[120:32.66]Dead guy.
[120:33.79]I'm a dung.
[120:56.99]It's one of those areas where you have to assume it probably is a secret wall somewhere.
[121:03.86]Somewhere.
[121:05.84]Hidden in the shit piles.
[121:29.48]There's three of them right here.
[121:45.31]Give me a secret door.
[121:47.37]Just like the Muppets.
[121:48.23]Remember in Muppets from Space?
[121:54.86]Bunsen and Beaker make the door in a jar so you can throw the secret door wherever.
[121:58.88]Poof.
[121:59.22]Secret door.
[121:59.82]Come on.
[122:01.00]Where's my Bunsen and Beaker door?
[122:12.57]Another ash for the lady.
[122:14.25]Except that one's covered in poo.
[122:19.17]Oddly enough.
[122:19.71]Alright.
[122:20.05]Where did I end up?
[122:22.55]So we're making a stew.
[122:23.76]Can I have some of the stew?
[122:25.84]Oh, nice.
[122:32.60]Goldilocks.
[122:34.86]Where are the three bears?
[122:35.64]Are they going to come and be mad that I didn't leave them any soup?
[122:55.38]Where do I come now?
[123:03.70]I guess I'm in the cathedral now.
[123:16.87]So, to get here, I came all the way down from the little cave of that first bonfire there.
[123:30.83]This guy looks a little intimidating.
[123:36.00]This castle's kind of cool, though.
[123:42.90]Alright.
[123:44.34]You are... Somebody just smoked me.
[123:50.03]Oh, right.
[123:50.71]There's somebody shooting me right now.
[123:52.59]Okay.
[123:54.63]Guy up top.
[124:18.97]That was the money maker right there.
[124:26.27]God damn, really?
[124:27.33]Like, that's... That's a bane of my entire existence in this game.
[124:34.54]Seriously, is that.
[124:37.20]I'm actually going to drink that divine blessing right now.
[124:40.50]It's like 100% heal.
[124:41.80]I'm just going to drink it.
[124:44.46]Give me all of my health back, please.
[124:45.84]It's like it never happened.
[124:49.31]I mean, you just barely don't kill them, but your brain thinks it did.
[124:53.75]That's the worst thing ever.
[124:55.47]I gotta be careful.
[124:59.76]The guy's still shooting stuff at me from above.
[125:06.04]The magic pixel.
[125:07.14]That's right.
[125:07.61]The one pixel that apparently didn't kill them.
[125:12.91]Which is pretty damn stupid.
[125:24.47]Kill this guy.
[125:33.33]One at a time.
[125:40.91]Ah, that's the lightning shit.
[125:42.16]He didn't even activate it.
[125:42.98]He just kind of did it.
[126:05.10]Not having enough time to heal.
[126:10.24]Thought I would have hit that one.
[126:15.60]Please be dead.
[126:16.28]Please.
[126:21.45]The magic pixel again.
[126:22.73]The magic 5 tenths of a percentage of health.
[126:30.35]Gets you every time.
[126:43.04]Oh, well.
[126:45.74]I guess... There's frozen... There's dry ice in those pots.
[126:52.04]Three chests.
[126:55.38]Which chests are breathing?
[126:57.62]And you know... I'm gonna go kill the guy with the bow.
[127:10.67]Because I feel like those chests are...
[127:13.40]I'm gonna get hit right in the back.
[127:15.64]There's more than one guy here?
[127:17.16]Oh, those are two pots.
[127:18.88]Alright.
[127:28.62]These guys are actually not hard to parry.
[127:30.02]They have a pretty huge telegraph.
[127:38.28]He's gonna give me the curse of that again.
[127:40.40]I'm just barely not doing enough damage.
[127:44.71]I will when I upgrade this again, though.
[127:53.42]Those Titanite shards are a big deal right now.
[128:04.37]Alright.
[128:05.25]Are any of these breathing?
[128:08.41]This one is definitely not breathing.
[128:12.84]So I'm going to open it.
[128:17.49]Leo Ring.
[128:18.17]What about you?
[128:20.92]Are you breathing?
[128:26.82]No.
[128:29.84]Smog's Great Hammer.
[128:31.26]A lot of free shit over here.
[128:35.55]It's concerning me.
[128:39.67]And Divine Blessing.
[128:46.62]Smog's a great hammer.
[128:49.96]Oh geez.
[128:52.86]Anchored weapon and Earth temporarily boost poise.
[128:54.90]I just want to look at it.
[129:01.79]You guys want a giant cartoon mallet?
[129:05.35]This is amazing.
[129:06.35]I feel like I'm in an episode of Tom and Jerry.
[129:11.48]That's fucking... I wish I could use this.
[129:14.66]I wish so badly I could use this.
[129:16.50]This is perfect.
[129:19.60]Oh, it's perfect.
[129:23.41]No, I can't use it.
[129:27.53]Oh, what a catastrophe.
[129:29.99]What a terrible tragedy.
[129:34.95]It's so perfect.
[129:36.53]Oh.
[129:38.31]Why is it so big?
[129:40.67]Why does it have to be that big?
[129:48.19]Just to use it?
[129:49.35]I... It makes me so slow.
[129:51.11]Okay, hold on.
[129:52.25]If I put that on... I don't even have... You don't even need 45 strength to even use the weapon.
[129:57.75]Alright, I gotta Tom and Jerry somebody.
[130:06.39]I have to Tom and Jerry one person.
[130:13.61]I have to take it off in the meantime, though, because it weighs too much.
[130:15.92]Don't worry.
[130:19.90]I promise I will Tom and Jerry a guy.
[130:26.30]That's so awesome.
[130:27.36]I'm so glad that something that goofy is in the game.
[130:37.14]So, is that really it?
[130:39.28]Is there anything else in the castle?
[130:43.98]Oh, yeah.
[130:44.20]I kind of turned this way and went around.
[130:45.50]Yeah.
[130:45.84]I can go this way.
[130:48.38]Because there was... This way or that way.
[130:53.95]Yeah.
[130:54.29]Okay.
[130:56.69]Oh, yeah.
[130:56.91]I got a ring, too.
[130:57.71]Thanks for reminding me.
[131:00.23]Where is it?
[131:00.97]Leo ring.
[131:01.56]Strengthens thrust weapon counterattacks?
[131:08.34]Uh...
[131:11.21]Does that mean the parry moves?
[131:13.67]Like the visceral attack after a parry?
[131:15.77]Or does that mean something else?
[131:25.75]Like what is classified as a counterattack?
[131:39.48]The great hammer's a thrust weapon?
[131:41.55]Somehow I don't agree with that statement.
[132:00.11]Enemies get a cartoony lump on their head when you hit them.
[132:08.62]If I ever have a... I'm gonna play through this game a couple times.
[132:12.81]If I make a strength character, he's going to use that weapon.
[132:18.59]I will accept no substitutes.
[132:21.06]What?
[132:22.00]Oh, shit.
[132:22.38]I'm getting invaded.
[132:23.08]Man, there's dogs here.
[132:25.78]Hold on.
[132:26.40]I gotta...
[132:39.26]What the fuck are you doing?
[132:42.14]What are you doing, man?
[133:02.82]Don't.
[133:03.26]Stop it.
[133:12.54]Fucking curse of the no damage pixel hit He's dead that Surprised I lived through that one Mannequin claws Let's take a look at those Oh
[133:45.03]Quick step.
[133:57.70]This is awesome.
[134:00.11]Get to be Baraka.
[134:03.63]And there's the quick step.
[134:07.29]There's the move that I've wanted to use like the entire game.
[134:17.05]These things are so sick.
[134:27.36]There's too many decisions.
[134:29.08]Stop giving me decisions.
[134:32.76]You're telling me that in less than 10 minutes... I get a Cartoon Hammer... Wolverine Baraka Claws... And...
[134:47.59]That's it.
[134:48.81]But you gave me Baraka claws and a hammer.
[134:51.27]And you're telling me that I have to... You're telling me.
[134:54.27]Hey, are you telling me?
[134:55.11]You're telling me.
[134:55.55]Hey, are you telling me?
[134:56.63]Hey, are you telling me?
[134:58.35]No, look.
[134:58.79]Are you telling me?
[135:01.35]Look, are you telling me that the tree... Alright, hold on.
[135:07.82]This guy, this piece of shit magic guy.
[135:13.32]Watch this one.
[135:15.46]Oh, boy.
[135:16.16]I think we might have a little slight problem.
[135:21.64]Eat it.
[135:21.82]I don't even care.
[135:24.34]Come on.
[135:25.57]Hit me again.
[135:26.09]Hit me again!
[135:31.73]You motherfucker!
[135:32.95]Didn't even kill him.
[135:35.31]Okay.
[135:36.17]Okay.
[135:37.55]No more fucking around.
[135:39.60]What am I doing?
[135:48.94]Joke's over.
[135:50.18]Joke's over.
[135:53.82]Joke's over.
[135:56.14]We had our little laugh.
[135:58.27]We laughed a little bit.
[136:03.07]If I had any points in strength, how awesome would that have been?
[136:28.75]Fucking katana, dude.
[136:29.57]The katana is so good.
[136:31.75]This has saved my life more.
[136:32.96]Using the thrust, the hangout move, and then you just dash.
[136:39.04]Link, sir, I didn't even laugh.
[136:43.62]That's because it's just a self-explanatory thing.
[136:49.39]Cartoon hit somebody with a hammer and then almost die for it and waste health.
[136:55.31]But, although I did get a divine blessing, so...
[136:59.75]Actually, I'm gonna drink that.
[137:02.49]I feel like I'm really close to something.
[137:03.87]It would be a shame if I didn't... If I died here because I'm acting like a jackass.
[137:09.78]Is there a dog right here?
[137:23.06]Alright, well... It's a good thing you were hiding there.
[137:36.81]There's a skip right there.
[137:42.19]I found a way to go.
[137:43.79]What does it say?
[137:49.42]Try tongue.
[137:52.14]I get it.
[137:52.58]I wonder where this brings me.
[138:05.88]How do you even become a mod?
[138:07.32]Well, I can answer that question.
[138:11.41]I will address that when I get to a bonfire.
[138:13.63]Well, this is... Ah, nice.
[138:15.01]That's right where I wanted it to be.
[138:21.87]I'm going to... Where's the bonfire from here?
[138:26.49]Isn't it back in... Yeah, it's right... I just have to run this way.
[138:30.77]I think I'm going the right way.
[138:31.89]If not, then I'm in deep shit.
[138:34.29]I think this is it.
[138:34.89]Yeah, this is the right way.
[138:52.06]Should be right over here.
[139:03.74]Really?
[139:04.08]That was a large... Jesus.
[139:11.47]I'm almost home.
[139:13.13]I'm almost home.
[139:19.63]Come on.
[139:21.79]Get away from me.
[139:22.71]Oh, he's coming back.
[139:23.85]Tch.
[139:33.93]JackOfMany, thanks a lot, dude.
[139:35.57]Welcome.
[139:36.65]Welcome back.
[139:43.55]Alright, so... After JackOfMany just subscribed for two months in a row, can we just give a quick round of a... Thank you.
[139:52.76]Some mods.
[139:55.38]The way mods work at the moment right now, I'm kind of doing, like, cycling people.
[140:00.58]So if you have mod right now, like, it might... I might take it away and give it to other people.
[140:06.01]And, like, test the waters on different people.
[140:09.13]I'm not sure yet.
[140:09.87]I think I'm gonna cycle some... Do some trial runs to see who's... I think is... What agrees with the things that I want to do the most.
[140:18.95]And we'll go from there.
[140:19.75]But there is no particular, like, tryouts.
[140:22.73]You just kind of have to be around and... I guess... Interact and...
[140:35.05]But I will potentially be cycling mods.
[140:39.09]And be like, you know, I got an eye.
[140:41.21]I got an eye.
[140:42.97]On these mods.
[140:43.63]You know what I mean?
[140:44.13]Taking a look at how they deal with certain situations.
[140:46.29]Taking a look at what they do.
[140:51.53]But there's no real... Like, how do I become a mod?
[140:55.35]You just kind of be around and hang and... Be cool.
[141:00.29]Be chill.
[141:00.87]Don't do anything crazy.
[141:07.09]I demand a pension plan.
[141:13.86]The pension money.
[141:18.00]Vitality.
[141:19.42]Bigger.
[141:24.63]Should have enough to get this to plus six or plus seven.
[141:28.53]Whatever plus it's going to be, I can get it to plus.
[141:30.35]Yes, I can.
[141:36.40]Now I'm up to Titanite chunks.
[141:41.67]Which I haven't really seen much of yet.
[141:46.15]Now I got... No, okay, I got the ash stuff for this lady.
[142:00.77]Is making 5x5 Rubik's cubes crazy and not chill?
[142:04.03]Uh, I'm gonna have to say yeah.
[142:08.98]If you do it too many times, I'm gonna have to say probably yeah.
[142:18.48]Okay, that's the poo one.
[142:21.85]She didn't care.
[142:22.55]It'd be funny if they gave her a different dialogue.
[142:27.53]Like, ooh, that's disgusting.
[142:29.37]I'll take it, I guess.
[142:32.48]So what did that add?
[142:35.26]Just... Alright.
[142:37.98]I gave her poo.
[142:40.14]And I guess it made her have to go poo.
[142:43.14]A lot.
[142:56.96]Don't I already have one of these?
[143:05.67]I think that's all that added.
[143:15.17]Now what's better?
[143:16.29]What's better for parrying?
[143:18.88]What's better?
[143:20.12]Large leather?
[143:20.84]Leather?
[143:21.30]I think I have like the best parrying shield in the game, don't I?
[143:24.08]Isn't leather shield just like the best thing you can use?
[143:26.72]It's like this tiny little parry point.
[143:39.63]How many of those souls do I have?
[143:43.48]I actually might have enough.
[143:47.78]And I pray this gets me to like 22,000.
[143:49.04]Yeah, it will.
[144:02.49]How many do I need?
[144:04.47]Oh, I almost had it perfect. 18.
[144:14.90]Alright, back to work.
[144:24.22]Come to the UK so you can accidentally bump into me and say, oh, hey.
[144:29.09]Oh, hey, dude.
[144:30.05]I didn't see you there.
[144:41.77]Are you going to pull a me to Peter Dinklage?
[144:48.02]Put points in strength.
[144:49.78]I'm getting my vitality and endurance to 25 each.
[144:53.78]Before I do anything else.
[144:59.18]So let's try the run technique.
[145:08.34]Hi guys.
[145:11.23]Bye guys.
[145:14.45]Fucking dumb homing crap away from me.
[145:16.23]Crap.
[145:16.49]I'm gonna start replacing swears with other things now, I promise.
[145:20.11]I'm gonna say crap instead of the other thing.
[145:38.95]Shit.
[145:39.11]I didn't think he was still on me.
[145:51.49]Hopefully you don't follow me.
[145:52.41]You probably will.
[145:54.50]Did he?
[146:01.74]I can hear something.
[146:07.11]I forgot about you.
[146:12.73]I don't want to aggro these dogs.
[146:19.95]I'd rather not fight them.
[146:28.90]Hopefully, me upgrading this will get rid of the... Stupid pixel damage that I didn't do.
[146:35.53]You know what I'm talking about.
[146:37.58]Well, my tiny health syndrome.
[146:41.75]I don't need to say.
[147:03.03]Kind of long fall.
[147:08.15]I need some Titanite chunks.
[147:09.17]I can hear heavy breathing.
[147:20.30]There's a couple of dudes here.
[147:28.52]Whoops.
[147:29.99]That's a lot of damage.
[147:34.15]I have a five hundo.
[147:43.27]Ah, I didn't get it off.
[147:56.72]Another blood gem.
[148:11.95]We'll take that item.
[148:15.19]I haven't used one of those bug pellets the entire game.
[148:23.60]I feel like maybe I should be using them in certain situations, but, you know, whatever.
[148:49.58]I feel like I'm getting close to a boss.
[148:59.53]Stayed underneath the side blade.
[149:02.54]Look at that!
[149:03.04]There's a boss!
[149:22.90]Pontiff Knight Curved Sword.
[149:28.22]Interesting.
[149:28.74]Before I go in the boss area, I'd like to see if there's an easier way to get here.
[149:58.76]Is there any point to coming back here?
[150:02.38]Liar ahead.
[150:16.23]I don't know.
[150:18.29]Maybe I'm just gonna have to run through.
[150:22.37]I'll try down here.
[150:24.87]There's a door.
[150:26.43]Oh, didn't see you there.
[150:27.27]Didn't see you there either.
[150:28.73]You both showed up.
[150:42.06]Wasn't there a door at the very beginning that I could open?
[150:47.60]And I remember looking over and saying, I could probably get that at some point soon.
[151:02.09]I want to find that door.
[151:05.97]I would like to find that door.
[151:18.44]Twists and turns.
[151:23.18]Oh, look at that!
[151:24.18]Bonfire's right there.
[151:25.02]Now, which bonfire is this?
[151:29.37]This is the... Manor Bonfire?
[151:34.70]Church of Yoshka.
[151:38.06]Okay.
[151:38.42]So I can literally just run to the boss now.
[151:41.48]Okay.
[151:42.46]Let's try to fight a boss.
[151:50.60]Am I ever going to play more Enter the Gungeon?
[151:56.07]Not in the immediate future.
[151:59.93]The plan is...
[152:03.31]Play Dark Souls 3 until I'm not playing Dark Souls 3 anymore.
[152:07.37]And then I'll take it from there, but not in the immediate future.
[152:09.77]Or we're just going, I guess.
[152:12.43]Pontiff... Sullivan.
[152:14.86]Is this guy Irish?
[152:19.08]Pontiff Sullivan.
[152:21.32]This guy has like a... Whoa.
[152:26.56]Oh, you are dancing around.
[152:36.50]So you can do a bunch of swings.
[152:45.85]Let's just figure him out.
[152:48.03]Let's get a fire sword.
[152:49.19]And a... He's got two lightsabers.
[152:58.44]Ah.
[153:11.29]Didn't seem too bad.
[153:13.76]Hmm, backhanded me, I don't know.
[153:34.87]This guy needs to calm down.
[153:35.95]What are you doing?
[153:42.26]Is he wings now?
[153:42.96]Is that what this is?
[153:43.44]Is this phase two?
[153:51.50]Oh, wait, there's another one.
[153:52.36]There's two of them now.
[153:56.21]Should I kill the clone?
[154:02.41]Did they mimic each other?
[154:03.35]Or is he... I don't know.
[154:11.43]Looks like he stands pretty close to him.
[154:16.06]Yeah, they do like the same moves.
[154:24.56]Oh, they're doing Ludwig stuff now.
[154:39.31]Thankfully it seems like they just do the same move One of them will do it and the other one will follow just have to okay boing Back it up back it up I'm in a bad spot.
[155:03.88]There's like all kinds of church stuff around me back to the wall.
[155:07.04]Oh
[155:18.11]Wow!
[155:30.03]I dodged that!
[155:31.09]I dodged it!
[155:31.81]I went through it, I was invisible when it happened.
[155:36.69]I was indivisible.
[155:46.48]Alright, I might be able to first try this guy if I don't do anything stupid.
[156:00.37]Alright.
[156:08.34]Damn it, I didn't think he was going to hit me with it.
[156:10.68]I'm in trouble here.
[156:11.35]I did just hurt him, though.
[156:17.41]Maybe it's... Hold on.
[156:22.42]I guess, can I kill it?
[156:24.78]Maybe it's better if I kill it.
[156:30.80]Um, I don't know.
[156:32.54]I'm interested to see that now.
[156:40.05]This guy doesn't seem too terrible.
[156:42.81]Maybe I should kill the clone.
[156:49.29]Maybe I will.
[156:49.95]Maybe I'll do some... I got pine resin.
[156:52.25]Might as well just do it, right?
[156:59.51]He's easy to run as well.
[157:11.41]I had, just learning his moves, spent a lot of Estuses.
[157:15.30]I feel like if I'm patient, I might not even need to kill the second one.
[157:20.46]Give it a try.
[157:33.79]Wow, I didn't, okay, shit.
[157:45.64]Oh boy.
[157:46.06]You know, I'm going to let him kill me.
[157:49.40]Just kill me.
[157:50.71]I came in here.
[157:51.29]I just wanted to start swinging.
[157:53.67]I forgot he does like potentially seven or eight swings in a row.
[157:58.35]Just got to take it slow.
[158:00.17]Take it slow.
[158:00.77]No reason to rush it like I just tried to.
[158:10.03]I hate that I'm facing the wrong direction.
[158:17.41]The scary part about this boss, it seems, if you get hit one time, you better be ready to get out of there.
[158:25.56]Because he could kill you with a combo.
[158:33.93]I'm so happy that it's this close, though.
[158:35.91]I got the skip and I don't need to run that fast.
[158:38.92]Don't need to run that fast.
[158:39.90]Let's put on some resin.
[158:43.60]For fun.
[158:50.31]Play fight.
[158:50.71]You wanna do dual Sith lightsaber battle?
[159:00.72]Easy.
[159:01.42]Easy.
[159:25.92]shit no no no no
[159:38.32]Shouldn't have done that.
[159:45.15]Got out of my rhythm there.
[159:47.08]Because I was trying to use a Blossom.
[160:15.99]Okay.
[160:24.18]That was worth a shot.
[160:25.18]So now I... Okay, that's a good idea.
[160:27.58]Now I know to do that next time.
[160:30.26]If there'll be a next time, boys.
[160:32.14]And girls.
[160:58.65]Hmm...
[161:42.32]Oh, double fire smash, double fire smash, no good!
[161:46.12]No good!
[161:47.50]No good.
[162:02.37]No good.
[162:02.75]Alright, lock onto him please.
[162:34.14]Damn it!
[162:39.26]That was a decent attempt.
[162:42.97]I thought maybe I could get one more hit on him, but... I'm gonna take an Ember.
[162:49.11]I'll get him this time.
[162:51.84]I'll get him this time.
[162:53.58]He ain't gonna escape me this time, buddy.
[163:06.06]Why did I not get my 8k souls?
[163:08.68]Because it kind of just throws me off my game.
[163:13.14]Instead of fighting the boss, I go, let me go grab these solos, and I get hit by something, so I'm not going to do it.
[163:19.58]Let's add magic to... I'll try this.
[163:24.74]Or maybe gold pine or something.
[163:26.12]My fire is still okay.
[163:35.36]But I am going to take these off because this was making a huge, huge problem for me cycling through that that many times.
[163:45.81]Let's go.
[163:55.49]Just is a game of patience with this dude.
[163:58.55]Just got to have the patience.
[164:05.19]How much patience do you have?
[164:12.95]In fact, I'd like to have this on before I even start the fight.
[164:22.49]Okay, let's do it.
[164:23.75]Mano a mano.
[164:31.16]Shit.
[164:53.51]You know what?
[164:54.27]The camera is kind of screwing with my brain here.
[164:57.17]We're spinning around in circles.
[165:00.19]Like, it's just... You see what's happening there?
[165:03.76]Just like the... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[165:07.92]I almost wish you could, like, lock the camera so it doesn't just rip around in a circle.
[165:19.48]Sometimes it just you really get to be a spatial awareness just goes to shit because you're it's still like You rip its dog It's just annoying as all hell
[165:53.15]Because then you have to, like, you have to adjust to the extreme camera adjustment.
[166:00.43]It sometimes can be not so easy to do that.
[166:04.57]You know, I'm gonna fucking break these on the way over to him.
[166:22.73]Not close enough.
[166:29.25]Holy shit.
[166:37.95]That didn't give me any time there.
[166:51.85]Oh boy.
[166:52.35]Geez, my first two attempts, I almost killed him.
[166:56.75]These second two attempts, I can't even fucking attack him.
[167:03.16]I brought him down to like 20% the first time and like 2% the second time.
[167:06.89]Now I can't even attack the dude.
[167:23.39]He didn't really give me any windows there either.
[167:25.94]He did that like... Just keep trying until he rolls a one.
[167:39.56]Oh, no.
[167:39.70]You're really going to do me like that?
[167:40.86]Now, this is the one.
[167:42.91]This is going to be the one, guys, because I got hit right there.
[167:59.75]1, 2, 3.
[168:20.58]Man, holy shit.
[168:21.82]What's going on?
[168:23.16]I can't even bring him down to 10% right now.
[168:25.72]I almost fucking killed this guy two times in a row.
[168:31.49]What has changed?
[168:34.55]I don't even know what changed.
[168:37.45]For me to have... You saw the first two times.
[168:40.22]This was not a problem at all.
[168:44.48]Not even in the slightest.
[168:46.40]I don't understand what the fuck is going on right now.
[169:05.11]You know what I think happened?
[169:07.29]This is something that happens in games like these.
[169:10.35]When you get that close to victory, and it's taken away from you, you just hate the world.
[169:20.24]ACG schmuck.
[169:25.10]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[169:25.86]Welcome.
[169:27.06]I'm gonna try to destroy him.
[169:28.91]I don't know what happened.
[169:29.87]Does it get harder if you lose?
[169:34.83]I'm just gonna dodge around for a little bit.
[169:36.43]I'm gonna slow down.
[169:37.15]I'm just gonna dodge around.
[170:06.10]Bad time to drink.
[170:06.86]Give me some distance.
[170:15.09]Give me some distance.
[170:32.72]It's the timing is so odd on some of these swings He's like goes.
[170:37.86]I'm gonna hit you.
[170:38.74]I'm gonna hit you up and sometimes he swings instantly What the fuck So like he raises his hand up like our hair And he does it and sometimes he goes I'm good you're dead oh
[171:02.52]That's so funny that me and Star have the exact same thing happen to us.
[171:06.63]We almost kill him two times in a row, and then we can't beat the boss.
[171:09.99]We can't even fight him.
[171:12.45]What the fuck is going on?
[171:15.89]That's so funny.
[171:29.42]The telegraphs on this guy are so awkward.
[171:32.84]Because you don't know... You don't know what he's going to do with what hand.
[171:38.85]Sometimes in his left hand, right?
[171:41.63]Sometimes he does a really long charge up.
[171:43.97]And sometimes he just stabs you instantly.
[171:47.01]This kind of sucks.
[171:48.01]Total butthole.
[171:57.84]Do you even have enough stamina to dodge those moves?
[172:00.00]I'm not even sure you do.
[172:06.70]This guy's fucking outrageous.
[172:15.76]Okay, this is a great... This is fantastic, because think about it, right?
[172:21.96]What did I say the first time I fought him?
[172:24.84]This guy seems pretty easy.
[172:26.96]Okay, this is not bad.
[172:28.39]This isn't bad.
[172:29.25]Now I can't even fucking hurt him.
[172:33.85]Can't even hurt this guy now.
[172:36.57]That's unbelievable.
[172:45.76]Game sucks.
[172:46.74]Game sucks.
[172:47.78]Game sucks.
[173:03.96]I was doing better when I was learning how the guy worked.
[173:46.60]Get away from me for a second.
[173:47.97]Give me a minute.
[174:23.14]Like never stop swinging.
[175:04.08]Alright.
[175:58.17]I got a new strategy for this dude.
[176:12.22]See if I can do it.
[176:20.72]Ah, just not close enough.
[176:27.23]No, I gotta get away.
[176:29.21]Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[177:00.07]Come on.
[177:03.27]Come get me.
[177:04.45]Did I lose lock on right there?
[177:08.45]Did that actually just happen?
[177:13.01]Why?
[177:21.56]This might be a wash.
[177:28.72]I thought they were going to dive forward.
[177:31.10]Apparently not.
[177:31.80]I would almost prefer them if they were not together.
[177:49.81]It just makes it so hard because the move happens so fast.
[178:11.16]Let me pull up an upset here.
[178:13.35]Let's do a huge upset.
[178:31.83]God, it's such a teeny-eeny-weensy-beensy.
[178:36.70]Pink bikini, polka dot bikini, tiny little area where you can swing.
[178:42.07]And if you don't get it perfect, you're dead.
[178:45.37]Am I gonna... No, I'm not summoning somebody.
[179:00.59]You gotta go it alone, man.
[179:06.69]Yeah, yellow polka dot bikini.
[179:07.97]That's what it is.
[179:19.83]I just gotta not freak the hell out in the first phase.
[179:23.23]It's not doing me any favors.
[179:32.54]Just stay around his shoulder.
[179:42.49]Okay.
[180:10.18]Oh, don't break it like that.
[180:11.34]Come on.
[180:12.04]Don't do that to me.
[180:20.75]Come on.
[180:44.50]Hmm...
[181:51.42]Fucker I didn't even see him do that move
[182:20.52]I don't care if this takes me all fucking day I'll stay here for another two hours Green blossom really just saved my life right there
[183:07.91]Do something!
[183:10.81]Do something!
[183:11.67]Anything!
[183:12.39]Do a move!
[183:14.72]Why are you both not doing moves?
[183:20.04]Come on!
[183:23.02]Do something, please!
[183:28.96]Do something!
[183:34.23]God, that took him forever!
[183:57.47]Now they're spreading out a little.
[183:58.53]Okay, good.
[184:04.99]I don't like being over here in the corner.
[184:15.40]I want full health as well.
[184:17.84]Could save my life.
[184:28.05]Get away.
[184:28.65]I don't like being over here.
[184:58.83]Just give it a...
[185:33.53]I'm gonna get a bit of spot jump over me again come on jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jock jam jock jams
[186:10.90]Whoa!
[186:11.32]I didn't think he was gonna go that far.
[186:17.17]Not a good place.
[186:19.09]Right, my back's against the wall right now.
[186:26.17]Stupid fucking church shit.
[186:27.73]Get out of my way.
[186:58.71]I wish they would do something.
[187:00.95]Why do they have to stand around like this sometimes?
[187:10.12]Do something.
[187:11.42]I keep doing that move rather than anything else.
[187:20.84]It's almost like he's turtling right now.
[187:22.24]Are you like turtling because you think I'm going to beat you?
[187:43.00]Come on!
[187:44.60]Come on!
[187:49.60]Come on!
[187:56.55]The power invested in me!
[187:59.47]I now pronounce you man and wife!
[188:28.70]Too easy.
[188:29.36]That was not easy.
[188:33.20]That was not easy.
[188:41.51]So, that was a Hail Mary right there, guys.
[188:45.17]That was a Hail Mary.
[188:47.55]Because, I'm not sure you noticed his HP.
[188:50.67]He needed two swings to die.
[188:54.07]So, when he landed on that move, I knew I had about a half a second.
[188:59.17]I held down R2.
[189:01.76]That was a Hail Mary.
[189:02.40]Because if it didn't hit, if it didn't kill him with that, then I was going to die.
[189:08.52]Let me check some subs.
[189:12.92]Oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom too.
[189:14.46]I'm gonna like piss out all that.
[189:18.92]I'm gonna pee and it's gonna be screaming.
[189:21.68]You know, it's gonna be like... A human being is gonna be screaming while I piss.
[189:30.99]Let me see the missed subscribers.
[189:44.86]Okay, dashboard.
[189:53.24]So it looks like... Kim for Eternal Mod has subscribed.
[190:06.39]Yeah, I'm not seeing resubs, unfortunately.
[190:09.05]But Kim for Eternal Mod, I will take your input.
[190:14.35]Thank you for the sub, though.
[190:15.07]I appreciate it.
[190:18.39]But, yeah, I'm going to... I'm going to take a quick little break.
[190:21.86]That was... That was enough to make me have maybe... I might even pee sludge.
[190:29.30]It might be solidified.
[190:30.86]So... I'll see you guys in about two minutes.
[190:36.33]Grab a drink, grab a snack.
[190:37.23]We're not stopping here.
[190:38.73]I'll see you soon.
[192:58.01]Hello.
[193:06.22]Yeah, sorry to the resubs if you're a resub and I didn't see it.
[193:09.56]I apologize.
[193:10.10]Oh, that... You're talking about my pee, huh?
[193:16.36]Huh.
[193:17.04]Interesting.
[193:17.74]That's funny.
[193:18.42]Huh.
[193:19.26]Huh.
[193:20.76]I muted my mic.
[193:22.72]Huh.
[193:26.74]Mmm, I see I caught you guys.
[193:39.24]Great Sword of Judgment.
[193:41.84]Profaned Great Sword.
[193:47.04]It's a magic sword?
[193:50.36]Were these both of his weapons?
[193:58.59]Katana.
[193:59.21]I'm going to stick with the katana.
[194:05.31]We're just going to smash it.
[194:12.29]Only 12,000?
[194:12.47]The bracelet king gave me 20,000.
[194:15.03]Are you serious?
[194:15.87]Let's see what I end up with at the end of this.
[194:35.73]I don't know.
[194:36.34]What are you doing over there?
[194:47.16]Heading out to the gym.
[194:48.28]That right grump clump.
[194:51.13]Thanks for sticking around.
[194:52.51]Take care dude.
[194:57.13]Let's get 18 strength.
[195:01.38]And we'll do another one in...
[195:05.80]Yeah, it was 18 strength.
[195:09.81]Because this does scale with strength as well.
[195:19.25]Albeit not as much.
[195:20.31]Nine.
[195:25.06]Nine!
[195:29.14]Nine!
[195:44.08]Didn't I get another... Did I get another ash thing?
[195:47.95]No.
[195:49.93]Sell some stuff, though.
[195:50.81]We're gonna sell... I'm gonna sell the funny hammer.
[196:04.40]Yeah, I'm selling Goofy's hammer.
[196:07.78]And this.
[196:09.94]And this.
[196:12.50]The Wolverine claws are cool, but I'm not going to use them this playthrough, so... See ya.
[196:18.58]Same thing with the pickaxe.
[196:21.00]See ya.
[196:23.24]Barbed straight sword.
[196:25.56]No, see ya later.
[196:28.36]This thing's cool, but I've already spent too much on the katana, so... See ya later.
[196:33.61]I'm going to hold on to that, though.
[196:39.51]Pontiff Knight curved sword.
[196:43.34]Frost Blade.
[196:44.08]Let's see what that does.
[196:58.88]It's got a nice little feel to it.
[197:04.52]That's kind of cool.
[197:05.16]So what is it?
[197:06.28]Chilling effect or something?
[197:12.56]Curve Swords have really great two-handed swings.
[197:16.34]Because they're right... It's a big, huge swing in front of your face two times in a row.
[197:21.61]Three times in a row, even.
[197:23.45]The blades are usually fairly long.
[197:36.14]But, unfortunately... I'm not going to be using it.
[197:40.02]So, it's getting sold.
[197:51.96]Probably, I'm gonna dump some of these shields, too.
[197:53.80]I don't have a reason to have them.
[198:00.82]Make sure I'm not gonna... Uh...
[198:19.53]Trying to make sure that there's not a better parrying shield I could put on.
[198:26.88]No, I think this is just the best thing for that.
[198:30.26]It always is in every Dark Souls game.
[198:31.80]I'm just gonna get rid of them.
[198:42.51]No, I don't need them.
[198:44.35]I'm not gonna be shield guy.
[198:49.59]But what is this?
[198:50.83]Spiked shield?
[198:54.65]You can use it as a weapon?
[198:59.51]What?
[199:01.57]Hold on.
[199:01.87]You can equip weapon... You can be shield weapon dude and just have two shields.
[199:08.56]Why do I want to do that?
[199:10.98]I'm going to do that.
[199:12.14]Not right now, but in some playthrough.
[199:13.82]I want to do that.
[199:32.08]uh this is like talismans and I'm not gonna use these ever staff like numb why would I ever have these get rid of a couple of these hoods I already have two of them a lot of gloves too I don't even know
[199:58.72]Alright.
[199:59.90]How many souls do I need?
[200:01.84]I just had a minor, minor brain freak out.
[200:03.80]I thought I sold the katana because I'm walking around like this.
[200:05.68]Is it 20,000?
[200:07.80]Exactly 20,000.
[200:07.98]Nice.
[200:08.42]Farewell, Ashen One.
[200:09.12]May the flames guide thee.
[200:32.98]Have I been recognized on the street?
[200:36.59]I can't say that I have.
[200:40.41]I'm not sure why I would.
[200:51.31]Now, when I go to PAX, some people will come up to me and be like, oh, hey, are you Jerma?
[200:56.79]I'm just like, yeah, it's me.
[200:58.67]And they're like, oh, we have a little stop and chat, you know.
[201:05.33]I'll usually do, like, a thing where I say on Twitter that I'm gonna be right next to the big statue.
[201:11.23]And people will come over and say hi.
[201:19.53]Let's go... Let's go this way first.
[201:26.27]I knew it.
[201:27.09]I knew there'd be a snack over here.
[201:29.94]Just knew it.
[201:34.32]Ooh, speaking of snacks.
[201:48.65]I have a lot of twinkling, Titanite.
[201:50.99]Didn't really have anything to do with.
[201:54.47]So he's gotten the tickets now, eh?
[201:56.52]Oh, uh... I still don't have a PAX badge.
[202:01.72]And it's in like two weeks or something.
[202:06.92]Probably should get on that, huh?
[202:09.60]What are these?
[202:09.98]What are these purple... This is a mad phantom.
[202:15.51]Will you summon it?
[202:20.15]No.
[202:22.68]Uh, no.
[202:25.16]That looks like PvP to me.
[202:29.04]Not into that at the moment.
[202:35.34]Somebody said I'm in PvP Central.
[202:39.34]Do I have... I gotta put on my fucking dog thing.
[202:43.36]I don't even have it on.
[202:46.00]What was the point of me joining that covenant if I don't have the dog symbol?
[202:55.02]This is... a lot of giants.
[202:57.64]Are they gonna wake up?
[203:29.05]Fat mages.
[203:32.65]Coming back here.
[203:39.40]Listen to me, sir.
[203:41.50]From that far away, huh?
[203:50.88]Now you're all in big, big trouble.
[204:00.25]You guys are nothing compared to the dumb shit I had.
[204:05.11]What?
[204:09.01]What is going on?
[204:11.28]Boss door?
[204:13.82]Why is it locking me over here?
[204:15.30]I'm locked in over here.
[204:21.27]It's actually very deceptive for what the actual hit is there.
[204:25.40]I feel like I have another half second to dodge, but I guess I don't.
[204:28.46]Uh-oh.
[204:30.98]What's going on?
[204:32.48]I'm being... Somebody's like... I'm being invaded.
[204:40.66]Well, I better clear this out before he gets here.
[204:42.65]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[204:56.21]Where are my branches?
[204:56.83]I love playing red light, green light.
[205:28.24]Wait, what?
[205:28.64]I'm being evaded again?
[205:29.76]There's two people invading my land?
[205:36.77]You can have more than one person attack you?
[205:39.23]Invade you?
[205:44.58]I'm confused right now.
[205:45.84]I always thought it was one person kind of just comes in.
[206:04.54]Oh, hold on.
[206:06.14]I heard something.
[206:12.09]I'm just the stone.
[206:13.27]Oh, I wonder if this is a guy or if this is a stone statue.
[206:18.11]Yeah, don't you know?
[206:18.69]You gotta watch out for the statue that's on the stairs.
[206:21.49]That's not a PvP guy.
[206:32.42]Are you guys serious?
[206:34.94]Come on.
[206:38.48]2v1?
[206:38.52]2v1?
[206:45.20]How is this fair?
[206:46.12]Oh, he's trying to go for his buddy.
[207:02.27]Are you gonna taunt me?
[207:08.01]You're gonna taunt in a 2v1 PvP fight?
[207:14.03]Who the fuck do you think you are?
[207:15.41]Hold on.
[207:22.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[207:24.75]So you can invade at the same time.
[207:32.39]At the same time, I... Can I call in a... Where's my phone, a friend?
[207:43.15]That seems just slightly unfair.
[207:45.98]Alright, let's get into some fucking fights.
[207:50.74]Now I'm mad.
[207:51.38]Yeah, I mean, let's just have invades and, you know, two invades at the same fucking time.
[208:06.04]So were those guys together?
[208:10.64]And if so... Why is that allowed?
[208:16.47]It seems...
[208:34.99]This seems dumb.
[208:43.84]Maybe it'll run into them again.
[208:46.40]This time I'm gonna throw acid in their face.
[208:48.52]I want that item in the middle.
[208:51.83]I want all the items.
[209:06.46]Who the fuck are you?
[209:09.28]Who is this guy?
[209:12.27]Who are all these guys?
[209:16.01]Is this NPCs all over the place too?
[209:22.29]So I see... Those guys have purple weapons.
[209:25.24]Does that mean that those are players?
[209:26.62]Are they holding players in their hands?
[209:38.00]They weren't players, but the four items they were holding in their hands were.
[209:45.09]They had VR.
[209:46.55]Virtual reality.
[209:47.21]They just had the headset on.
[209:48.91]They wanted to be the items.
[209:53.82]Pretty much what I'm trying to say is, game sucks.
[209:56.00]You know?
[210:03.60]It doesn't open?
[210:16.97]I feel like one of these is going to open.
[210:18.93]No.
[210:19.25]Too much of a lock on it.
[210:20.19]Can't get it.
[210:28.42]Well.
[210:31.20]Well.
[210:33.88]Well.
[210:35.62]Okay.
[210:37.72]Can I have a nice duel with somebody?
[210:40.12]Like a 1v1.
[210:41.70]We both know.
[210:42.42]We both bow.
[210:44.26]And we fight.
[210:46.32]I want to do that.
[210:51.95]I mean, I'm here.
[210:53.11]This is supposed to be the PvP zone.
[210:55.59]PvP central.
[210:58.53]I want to do the thing where you bow and then you both fight.
[211:00.63]There were just like five signs out here.
[211:05.22]Where are they?
[211:10.04]There we go.
[211:12.82]Okay, summon sign.
[211:15.04]Summon this dark spirit.
[211:18.61]Yeah.
[211:20.69]Okay, they won't let me.
[211:25.46]They can't summon that person anymore.
[211:27.92]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[211:33.20]Peter G. Thanks for the two months, dude.
[211:38.83]Here we go.
[211:41.19]Big Mac?
[211:42.95]Or... Big Mac.
[211:44.51]Are you kidding me?
[211:47.29]What the fuck?
[211:52.43]Game sucks.
[212:01.66]So you can invade me, but you can't let me PvP on my own terms game.
[212:06.64]Throw like two people in my game that I don't know where they are.
[212:09.06]They're just gonna come kill me together as two people.
[212:11.40]But I can't pull somebody in to fight me.
[212:20.26]See what happens when that happens again.
[212:22.27]See what happens when that happens again.
[212:23.47]This is where I got invaded last time.
[212:37.54]It's a door to somewhere.
[212:39.36]Oh, I'm old.
[212:58.31]Oh, I'm old.
[213:05.95]You killed me.
[213:09.74]That's the skip.
[213:12.24]For whatever is left.
[213:17.62]Sometimes you miss two times in a row.
[213:20.00]It's alright, isn't it?
[213:35.65]I wish I was a sorcerer right now.
[213:38.83]I think this will be going smoother.
[213:51.36]Oh, Ian McKellen!
[213:53.92]Can I hear that?
[213:54.66]Here, here, here.
[214:07.42]I'm glad you guys come in pairs too.
[214:19.63]Watch me kill your friend.
[214:24.81]Watch me kill you right in front of your eyes.
[214:34.90]Hold on a second.
[214:35.66]I gotta make my character... I can't even talk.
[214:38.26]You know what I was gonna say, though.
[214:53.19]There's one dummy over there.
[215:04.68]Did I get anything from that?
[215:07.97]Drang Twinspears.
[215:11.35]His item.
[215:12.51]Hmm.
[215:16.01]How are you going to give something like this a D in Dexterity?
[215:20.09]Scaling?
[215:22.84]Like, you would figure this is a complete and total Dexterity item, right?
[215:30.95]That was cool.
[215:32.27]That was cool.
[215:32.63]I'm going to do it to this guy.
[215:33.51]I'm going to do the running charge thing to this guy.
[215:39.01]52 damage.
[215:42.30]Okay.
[215:44.98]Well.
[215:49.08]Never mind.
[215:52.90]Here's something to contemplate about this game.
[215:57.86]I don't think I've seen any weapons that scale higher than a C in the whole game.
[216:07.24]I didn't even really think about that.
[216:09.98]I have not seen any, any, any, none that scale with a C, like above a C or B or an A or an S. Is that where like infusion comes in?
[216:21.07]Because I feel...
[216:27.68]Sort of like that should be a thing.
[216:37.56]Of course.
[216:38.99]Of course.
[216:39.73]Where are you?
[216:40.75]Where is he?
[216:51.84]Thought he was on the other side.
[216:52.88]I thought he was on the other side.
[216:56.24]I got hit in the back and I thought it was coming from the other direction.
[216:59.61]I got hit in the windshield.
[217:05.01]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[217:09.86]Oh, Foss.
[217:10.34]Thanks, dude.
[217:15.68]I'm so sorry for that one.
[217:18.42]He wasn't down there.
[217:19.38]That's for sure.
[217:20.14]That is for sure.
[217:21.76]Come on.
[217:22.12]I want a BBB.
[217:28.56]I mean, I have one.
[217:31.28]Look.
[217:31.58]I have a sharp gem.
[217:40.15]Sharp gem.
[217:40.67]Infuse to create sharp weapon.
[217:44.60]There's no option for me to use it.
[217:50.71]Do I need to find another piece of coal for the blacksmith to be able to use that?
[217:57.15]And should I make sure every sentence is inflection with a question?
[218:03.32]Maybe every end of every sentence should end like this?
[218:06.74]Now do I go... Now those guys are shooting fire.
[218:14.19]I wonder if I can get fire later in the game?
[218:18.45]Hot dogs are a delicious food.
[218:33.08]Yeah, I don't have the option to use it at the smith.
[218:34.70]I guess I have to find another piece of coal, but God knows where the hell that is.
[218:41.32]Oh yeah.
[218:43.10]Oh yeah.
[218:48.83]It's a long way down.
[218:52.69]Wait.
[218:57.05]Okay, that's why I stopped for a second.
[218:59.07]I have to fight the lizard demon.
[219:09.77]Oh boy.
[219:10.27]You gonna throw more than one at me?
[219:23.09]They're both aggroed.
[219:26.05]They're both aggroed right now.
[219:29.62]Why would they both come at you at the same time?
[219:39.60]So I wouldn't run out.
[219:42.08]That's so stupid.
[219:44.92]Put two of these guys down here.
[219:50.48]I have a monumental pain in the ass.
[219:56.46]Well, I'm going to go back down there and I'm just going to try to run through and grab the items.
[220:01.12]Because what's the point of fighting two enemies at the same time that swing in like every direction every half of a second?
[220:09.50]I'm not sure.
[220:10.54]I'm not going to find out.
[220:13.92]But I'm going to take my anger out on this guy's fucking leg.
[220:18.74]Are some of them just alive and not alive?
[220:20.04]I don't get this.
[220:20.50]I feel like one of them stood up at some point.
[220:29.12]Yeah, this guy stood up.
[220:29.86]See?
[220:38.03]Kind of getting rained on.
[220:38.93]I'm going to take care of these guys up here.
[220:55.97]Drink!
[221:26.86]Katana!
[221:29.30]Oh, really?
[221:31.68]Let's walk.
[221:32.34]Is he not dead?
[221:34.10]I guess there was another guy right there.
[221:38.18]Oh, there's another guy.
[221:39.16]Is that guy walking around?
[221:49.04]Now I'm going to fight the giant.
[221:59.91]Anybody else find it slightly annoying that they can shoot those from as far away as he just did?
[222:06.58]Was it Shrine of Vamana?
[222:08.44]Whatever it is.
[222:09.08]Shrine of Vamana.
[222:11.18]I remember that place.
[222:13.53]It sucked.
[222:14.01]I'm not going to lock on to this guy.
[222:31.73]Yikes.
[222:43.90]Whoa, he did that differently.
[222:45.24]Okay, I should lock onto him.
[222:59.75]Really weird waited.
[223:01.62]I'm just gonna stop talking Give me something good I Was not something good something boring and something I already have a lot of Thanks for the snooze
[223:28.70]You want me to slurp my straw?
[223:29.58]Is that what you want me to do?
[223:30.34]Alright, fine.
[223:30.70]There's too much liquid in there.
[223:35.94]I can't do it.
[223:36.36]Sorry.
[223:37.05]I failed you.
[223:47.38]I wanna go... I wanna be the guy.
[224:04.69]Alright, I'm not going to fight them.
[224:05.83]I'm just going to try to run through them.
[224:09.07]There's an item here and an item in the corner over there as well.
[224:16.16]Human dregs.
[224:28.62]And... A deep gem.
[224:30.55]And...
[224:35.96]Somebody in the corner.
[224:40.70]I'm praying to this?
[224:42.67]No, I don't want to join your covenant.
[224:44.53]You don't even exist.
[224:54.94]Why would I join a covenant of a guy that can't even do anything for me?
[225:06.56]What a strange place for a covenant.
[225:09.95]Secret wall in the corner behind a bunch of scary enemies.
[225:17.70]Record keeper, that is true.
[225:19.56]That is that NPC.
[225:25.02]That emote sucks, by the way.
[225:27.16]I might delete it.
[225:29.72]It's like a fat chin Easter egg.
[225:33.86]The thing is just not good, not funny, and it's bad.
[225:37.65]And it's going to get deleted.
[225:47.38]Where am I?
[225:47.74]Oh, that's where I got knocked off the edge, right?
[226:02.13]Titanite scale?
[226:04.25]Where's the Titanite chunk?
[226:05.70]That's the one I want.
[226:20.98]Yeah, but... I really do feel like I... Oh my god, what a horrible place.
[226:28.63]What a terrible place.
[226:33.49]What a terrible place.
[226:37.27]They're just shooting gigantic knockback arrows in every direction.
[226:44.49]Just truly awful.
[226:47.88]What a sight to behold.
[226:56.68]What a sight.
[227:03.24]game sucks no not yet if I die to that again then you'll hear it as of right now game not suck but don't worry game still sucks
[227:32.15]I just wanted to look over there and make sure I wasn't seeing anything.
[227:35.71]This dude's had a pretty big jump.
[227:44.89]Didn't I kill an entire congregation of these guys?
[227:48.66]A long time ago.
[227:59.60]From downtown, you got me.
[228:06.32]Okay.
[228:08.62]Actually, it might not be a stupid idea to put on one of the shields that I deleted.
[228:15.57]You know the shields, all of which I sold?
[228:20.21]So that idea is down the toilet.
[228:21.81]I'm going to have to just not get hit.
[228:22.91]Okay, one over there.
[228:27.95]Is there one behind?
[228:28.57]One to the left, to the right.
[228:32.43]Top right.
[228:32.99]Is there one in the middle, too?
[228:38.80]No idea.
[228:39.18]I'm just gonna have to keep moving and just go like this.
[228:55.65]Can I fight you over here, please?
[228:57.67]I'd like to fight you over here.
[228:59.55]If that's okay with you.
[229:00.99]Why do I have two swords?
[229:03.69]I'm holding two weapons.
[229:07.73]This is freaking me out.
[229:10.83]What is going on?
[229:20.14]Oh, no, no.
[229:20.58]That was one of those... Okay, that was one of those spears.
[229:23.12]It's weird.
[229:36.56]Sick of getting Titanite shards.
[229:39.18]Give me the chunks, man.
[229:49.67]Really?
[229:50.91]Neither one of us hit each other?
[230:11.24]Not this time.
[230:14.15]It harpooned into you, failfish.
[230:20.02]Hey.
[230:21.34]It kind of looked like my weapon for a second.
[230:27.27]Give me a break, man.
[230:28.29]Come on.
[230:31.86]I can look in there, can I?
[230:33.64]It harpooned for a second.
[230:35.24]I don't like failfish.
[230:36.86]Failfish makes me feel like shit, guys.
[230:39.10]When people do failfish, I just go like... People are disappointed in me.
[230:44.33]They're pissed.
[230:45.57]I don't like failfish.
[230:47.05]Don't do it again.
[230:47.69]Don't ever do it again.
[230:48.43]Don't do it.
[230:48.83]What do you got?
[231:15.48]Not in a good place to be fighting you right now.
[231:17.39]I seem to be having some trouble with you.
[231:46.32]Resident sleeper.
[231:48.17]I'm like looking at chat right now.
[231:49.41]That's not a good idea.
[231:50.25]I got his helmet.
[232:06.54]Oh, fail, fail.
[232:08.74]Oh my god, this guy.
[232:22.03]I look like a cartoon character.
[232:23.07]Which one?
[232:27.85]I don't know.
[232:29.09]It's fleeting me right now.
[232:32.03]Who am I?
[232:39.42]I am starting to roll very slowly.
[232:45.92]Sauron.
[232:46.40]No, not Sauron.
[232:47.44]I'm thinking of somebody else.
[233:00.46]Okay, hold on.
[233:01.22]I need to put on some of the, uh... This is scary.
[233:22.01]Bird man.
[233:23.45]Bird person?
[233:29.90]No, I like the other one better.
[233:30.87]I'm going to put the jailer robes on.
[233:34.93]Oh, God.
[233:40.01]Nothing about that looks good.
[233:43.03]I'm going back to the jailer robes.
[233:45.15]Now this is cool looking.
[233:52.10]Nice.
[233:52.48]I like how it moves with my body.
[233:59.17]Alright, I'm getting spun around in a direction.
[234:01.91]Hold on, guys.
[234:04.65]I'm getting... You know what I mean?
[234:12.27]Looks like my hair is moving around.
[234:13.59]That's going to be distracting the hell out of me.
[234:18.05]More ashes.
[234:20.11]I'd like to find coal.
[234:21.13]Is there one that I didn't kill?
[234:26.79]I guess.
[234:37.49]Yeah, that guy right there.
[234:51.44]I was gonna go for a funny moment.
[234:52.89]A funny moment, but no.
[234:55.17]No.
[234:59.81]I would have thrown that bomb at him and put like a fucking loud duck quacking like quack when he fell off or I would have like fucking like static like boom yeah I'd put like a ooh good thing I saw that guy
[235:32.28]I think I am going to throw a bomb at this dude.
[235:36.84]I absolutely am going to drop a massive bomb on this guy.
[235:45.89]He'll come up here.
[235:52.49]Get up here.
[235:59.42]I had to get that and I didn't get it because it took too long.
[236:22.32]Vesper ties fall for Vesper's scissors.
[236:35.20]Serious?
[236:38.42]Alright, well, I'll almost just kill you instantly.
[236:40.38]What?
[236:44.27]What?
[236:48.53]You have a spear!
[236:50.43]You don't have to be doing this!
[237:08.40]He keep- Stop doing that.
[237:11.24]He's shooting me with an arrow.
[237:12.18]You know what I mean?
[237:27.73]Sometimes it's a little laugh moment.
[237:33.27]Shit.
[237:35.13]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[237:36.21]What's down here?
[237:36.67]I need to, like, before I get invaded.
[237:39.53]What is this?
[237:40.75]Illusion ahead.
[237:41.21]Illusion, illusion, huh?
[237:41.95]Illusion?
[237:43.83]Okay, there's an illusion, but what's that?
[237:44.83]Anything else in here important?
[237:47.83]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[237:52.48]Ember.
[237:54.66]Hidden path ahead?
[237:55.40]What are you talking about?
[237:57.50]I got no time for this.
[237:58.34]I have to just go down to the illusion.
[238:00.30]Because some dude is running after me right now.
[238:03.68]Hopefully he doesn't know where I am.
[238:06.28]Bonfire down here?
[238:06.96]Alright, give me a bonfire.
[238:16.44]That's a lot of stuff.
[238:23.01]I feel like this is a boss room.
[238:24.53]Or something.
[238:28.03]Am I gonna get killed here?
[238:29.79]What is this?
[238:35.19]Sadness?
[238:37.52]It'll happen to you, too.
[238:38.66]What's going on?
[238:39.12]What are they talking about?
[238:39.88]I can't, like, sneak around?
[238:47.71]If only I had a woman.
[239:00.55]Okay.
[239:09.86]Pocky!
[239:11.08]Pocky, thanks for subbing, dude.
[239:13.00]Or dudette.
[239:15.62]So I don't have to go... I gotta... I don't know.
[239:27.07]Is that guy still in my world?
[239:36.27]Hide?
[239:36.65]No, I need to get to the next stage, the next area.
[239:40.85]Ooh, thank goodness.
[239:45.93]Now I will hide.
[239:46.77]No, I won't.
[239:50.15]There's probably something behind here that I can do.
[239:52.19]That is... Shit is spinning around.
[239:54.25]Oh, that was kind of... Kind of... Kind of...
[240:08.85]Wouldn't it tell me if he left my game?
[240:10.41]Is this guy seriously still looking around for me?
[240:23.54]I can spin the device?
[240:25.42]Hold on.
[240:27.30]So you can... Push it and go to different areas.
[240:30.26]I wonder if I can see this dude.
[240:34.66]I got like a view of the whole area.
[240:35.98]What if I just saw him walking around like a mouse in a maze?
[240:39.96]Throw something at him and, like, laugh.
[240:50.07]How about this side?
[240:53.09]Anything of interest?
[240:55.91]Where is he?
[240:58.90]This guy's gonna make me... There he is.
[241:00.04]There he is.
[241:02.38]Can he knock it up here?
[241:03.62]Hold on a second.
[241:04.04]I'm gonna turn this.
[241:05.90]I gotta turn it.
[241:06.34]I gotta turn it so he can't see.
[241:07.22]He can't get me.
[241:08.67]Come on!
[241:09.75]I gotta spin the device.
[241:12.35]Come on!
[241:15.65]He's not gonna be able to make the steps.
[241:19.17]Ah, that's too bad.
[241:23.31]Oh, sorry.
[241:37.86]Did he just press the button?
[241:41.68]Hold on.
[241:41.96]Can he pull the lever?
[241:44.10]He can't, can he?
[241:47.93]He just pulled it.
[241:48.43]He pulled it.
[241:48.79]He's coming up.
[241:53.11]He's coming up.
[241:53.69]I'm gonna... Oh, watch this.
[241:54.85]This is gonna be great.
[241:57.77]This is gonna be so awesome.
[242:01.87]Yeah, come on up.
[242:22.39]He's gonna know immediately Nobody here but us statues He's gonna see the doors not open And he's gonna be like wait a minute That didn't even open the door Where the hell did he go?
[242:48.80]He's so confused
[242:52.71]I could have sworn I saw that guy come up here.
[242:56.40]Maybe I should check out the burning statue that's out of place.
[242:59.06]Okay, he's gonna come back down.
[243:03.38]See if he figures it out.
[243:08.46]He's like, did he jump off?
[243:17.25]Surprise!
[243:27.58]Ow!
[243:38.49]Ooh!
[243:39.21]Stuck ya!
[243:49.71]I'm freaking him out with my, like, face.
[243:52.05]Oh, you wanna do that move?
[243:54.95]Why am I facing the other direction?
[244:02.22]Ooh, snuck attack.
[244:17.06]Whoa, whoa.
[244:20.77]Where did he come from?
[244:27.91]That guy was pissed that I beat him.
[244:34.76]It's alright, I lit the bonfire, I'm fine.
[244:44.30]Yeah, see, I'm good.
[244:46.72]Oh, I tricked, did you see how much I tricked that guy?
[244:50.43]This game is fun.
[244:52.67]This game is really fun.
[244:53.89]Okay, I recommend the game.
[244:58.78]You're gonna see this as, here we go, I'll get... I now recommend this game.
[245:03.22]Wholeheartedly.
[245:05.02]If you'd like to have fun in... That's not even funny.
[245:07.77]We're gonna just go back.
[245:13.35]That's so funny that he walked up to the door and noticed it wasn't even open.
[245:17.41]And... You can imagine what's going through that guy's brain.
[245:21.56]I saw he... He came up here.
[245:24.40]And he didn't open the door.
[245:31.38]That was fun.
[245:33.12]Even if I lost the PvP fight, that was still fun.
[245:38.58]PvP, when you get a good fight like that, that's actually really, really, really fun.
[245:52.99]I don't want to waste that.
[246:07.91]That's fun.
[246:09.11]Alright, did I miss any subs?
[246:10.73]Because apparently Twitch is screwed up or something.
[246:12.93]I want to make sure I didn't miss anybody.
[246:21.58]Uh...
[246:37.83]Did I miss OFAS?
[246:41.57]OFAS.
[246:42.83]I'm not sure I got you.
[246:43.77]I'm not sure I saw you.
[246:44.85]But thanks for subbing, dude.
[246:45.77]Appreciate it.
[246:48.37]Welcome.
[246:51.90]If I did get you, I did.
[246:52.82]But no, resubs are not showing up even on my dashboard here.
[246:59.22]So I'm not sure.
[246:59.78]But yeah, let's keep playing this game.
[247:03.61]I wonder how long you would have walked around.
[247:05.89]I don't know.
[247:16.18]Oh, no, wait.
[247:20.54]I did get another one of these.
[247:21.40]What do you got?
[247:25.86]What's new?
[247:30.74]Moss fruit, maybe?
[247:33.01]I don't remember these being here.
[247:38.02]Large Titanite is now purchasable.
[247:39.60]Thank God.
[247:40.24]I need Titanite chunks.
[247:45.64]This is new, too.
[247:48.28]Should I get the big rain hat?
[247:55.99]Yes, let's see.
[247:57.25]I'll show you guys what I was talking about before.
[247:58.61]What?
[248:03.56]See, infuse.
[248:04.40]I want to infuse this.
[248:05.27]I have the sharp gem.
[248:08.29]But it won't let me use it.
[248:15.05]It's probably back in one of the other areas that I...
[248:19.31]That's the type of thing where if you really want to do that, like, I want to get this to, like, B scaling, which would be great.
[248:23.82]I'm going to have to, like, go to, like, a Wikipedia page eventually to do that.
[248:26.98]But for right now, this is spoiler-free, like, just blind playthrough of the game.
[248:33.01]I can figure that stuff up later on, like, a second playthrough.
[248:41.77]I guess we'll keep going.
[248:57.52]Even if you lost, we would hate you.
[249:00.66]That's not very nice.
[249:05.60]Why did I just have... Alright, here we go.
[249:06.72]Touch summon sign.
[249:07.36]Alright, Richard Rustwell.
[249:11.06]Come on!
[249:14.06]That's not cool.
[249:18.57]That's dumb that I can get invaded, but I can't actually bring anybody into my world to fight like a one-on-one just like I want to fight you.
[249:30.79]That's not fun.
[249:45.73]Wow.
[249:46.39]Wow.
[249:57.00]Whoops, wrong button.
[249:57.76]I meant to hit triangle.
[249:59.72]Or, for all you Xbox guys, triangle.
[250:03.36]Uh, why?
[250:03.90]I had to look down.
[250:17.94]I got it.
[250:18.24]You got an ember?
[250:19.22]No, no, I don't got an ember.
[250:20.42]I don't need to do that.
[250:25.65]I save my embers for bosses, man, or like dire situations.
[250:29.67]They come in much more handy for me.
[250:31.51]Like this, I can just figure this out and eventually run by these guys if I need to.
[250:36.04]Because if I die right now with an ember, I'm going to be real sad.
[250:39.22]But for like a boss attempt, that extra 20%, 30% health.
[250:46.12]Because I don't want to just go have to like chew through them at the shop for 2,500 for one.
[250:54.41]And Bob, I noticed you did a FailFish there.
[250:56.79]Bob, I noticed you did a FailFish there.
[251:04.53]Why am I on that tonight?
[251:05.71]I don't know.
[251:06.01]I don't have an explanation as to why I think that's funny tonight.
[251:18.86]That almost instantly killed me.
[251:29.22]Alright dude, what are you doing?
[251:35.83]So many lightning moves.
[251:45.75]I thought it was going to be lightning.
[251:47.07]This guy is hurting way more than the other guys were.
[251:49.43]Alright, no more fucking around.
[252:09.11]Titanite.
[252:13.39]Can we get some failfishes in the chat, please?
[252:18.44]Chat, chat, chat, chat.
[252:24.40]Visions of pure luck.
[252:32.39]That's such a perfect place for a secret door.
[252:36.48]That I'm shocked there was not one over here.
[252:52.73]What about over here?
[252:55.39]Nope.
[252:58.22]A big face and hair.
[253:00.40]Trying to see if there's one.
[253:01.10]No.
[253:08.38]My big ass face.
[253:12.23]This guy's got a big ass face.
[253:27.44]Beware of tough enemy.
[253:28.28]I already beat the tough enemy.
[253:30.50]Already got that guy.
[253:35.96]Check one way, you gotta check the other way, too.
[253:46.89]Giant's Coal.
[253:49.03]That might be our ticket, guys.
[253:50.31]That might be the big ticket.
[253:52.99]I hope that's the ticket.
[253:56.23]If that's not our ticket, I'm gonna... be sad.
[254:01.36]That's pretty much it.
[254:03.12]I'm gonna be sad.
[254:05.68]Hey, I can see subs now.
[254:14.09]Duder.
[254:15.53]Duder.
[254:16.77]Duder 4.
[254:18.47]Whoa.
[254:19.33]Thanks for subbing.
[254:20.35]Appreciate it, dude.
[254:20.93]Welcome.
[254:23.49]Expensive.
[254:30.59]There's a boss.
[254:34.09]Good to know it's up here.
[254:35.89]Right next to the bonfire, pretty much.
[254:42.73]10,000 souls, though.
[254:43.81]I should probably just go back and see if I can upgrade the katana to have a B or an A in scaling with this.
[254:51.86]I'm hoping it's the right thing.
[254:56.48]Moonlit arrow.
[254:59.22]Hope this doesn't kill me.
[254:59.94]Don't kill me.
[255:00.38]Don't kill me.
[255:00.82]Don't kill me.
[255:03.38]Open the front door.
[255:12.13]I knew it!
[255:12.93]I, like, knew he was behind me, too.
[255:18.27]I could feel him.
[255:19.79]He made the sound and I heard the... I just figured I could have pushed the lever, but I didn't know if that was going to do that or open the door.
[255:28.03]Whatever.
[255:28.48]I can get right back there.
[255:35.70]Uh, I want to go back.
[255:37.29]That's the front door too.
[255:38.45]Shit in my pants.
[255:47.90]I think I've exclaimed more noises than playing any scary game I've ever played.
[255:55.40]These games are terrifying, man.
[255:56.78]They just throw shit at you.
[255:57.77]They jump scare you.
[255:58.51]They don't...
[256:03.29]my my the coal of that peaceable giant seems like ages past I missed the old bugger right my thanks I'll be smithing weapons it's but a small servant alright come on we got refined raw crystal simple
[256:34.20]Where did I miss this?
[256:38.46]To do this sharp.
[256:42.57]I have to get it from somewhere.
[256:47.07]So what did that even add?
[256:50.19]Crystal?
[256:50.93]Or like simple?
[256:54.96]These are all magic.
[256:59.90]Damn it.
[257:00.28]I really thought that was going to be the one.
[257:06.09]How's my night going?
[257:06.69]It's going good.
[257:08.79]How's your night going?
[257:13.51]Damn it, that sucks.
[257:23.88]Where do I find the coal to be able to do my sharp gem upgrade?
[257:43.22]Where's the bloomin' onion?
[257:50.88]You know, it's going great.
[257:51.82]Sub to say you're my favorite YouTube content creator and you da bestest.
[257:57.96]Well, that is very, very kind of you to say.
[258:00.98]Thanks a lot, dude.
[258:01.48]Appreciate it, man.
[258:02.20]Appreciate it, dude.
[258:02.80]Appreciate it.
[258:03.48]Appreciate it.
[258:03.88]Appreciate it, dude.
[258:04.42]No.
[258:07.15]No, thanks.
[258:07.63]That's... It's funny you say YouTube.
[258:12.79]Well, I've had like a YouTube video.
[258:15.11]I say this every night.
[258:16.07]It lasts like three nights.
[258:19.03]It's like a video that's like almost ready to be made.
[258:21.91]I just am too addicted to this game and streaming.
[258:25.33]It's like a blast for me right now.
[258:27.71]I don't even know why I'm fighting you guys.
[258:28.74]I don't even.
[258:30.46]I don't even need to be doing this.
[258:33.88]Just go around.
[258:41.96]Oh, that was not the right way to go around.
[258:43.34]It was the other way.
[259:01.14]Giant.
[259:06.48]Did that loading screen just set it?
[259:08.02]Are you serious?
[259:11.26]Where do I get it?
[259:13.18]Have I worked on it at all in the past three days?
[259:15.55]No, not really.
[259:17.51]I've compiled a couple of things, but it's not like a video that's easy to make.
[259:24.11]I don't want to say what it is, because... Just know it's a whole ordeal.
[259:35.06]I'm gonna stuff you all in this corner.
[259:48.11]Proof of a concrete kept.
[260:05.98]You have to be embered, so it's like humanity to summon people, I guess, whatever.
[260:19.42]That's where I died.
[260:20.14]Where's the big alien dog person?
[260:26.22]In the chandelier.
[260:26.98]I got slugs.
[260:39.07]These are like beefy slugs.
[260:40.79]These guys just take forever to kill.
[260:46.64]These guys take way too long to have to... There's another one coming up.
[260:53.44]Die already.
[261:24.75]I just don't want to back up into one of these dudes while I'm fighting the big dog person.
[261:35.02]And then one guy back here.
[261:51.51]Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[261:54.57]Oh, forget about these dumb things.
[261:56.67]I might just open the door.
[262:00.13]Because I think you're invincible when you're doing an interaction like that.
[262:10.07]I hope so.
[262:14.48]He's like waiting for me to finish.
[262:19.40]Oh, this is the Petrify guy.
[262:20.62]This is such a bad place to fight him, too.
[262:24.24]There's like, pillars everywhere and... You know what I mean?
[262:30.00]This is... the front door.
[262:42.77]Yyyyup.
[262:44.79]Oh, please.
[262:48.80]Don't do this to me.
[263:01.35]He just stared at me from up there.
[263:07.84]At least the door is open.
[263:19.95]Shit.
[263:20.21]I thought he was going to just do the one he did the first time.
[263:23.07]You know what?
[263:24.37]We're going to reset this.
[263:26.44]I'm resetting it.
[263:28.18]Reset.
[263:28.92]Reset it.
[263:29.38]Reset it.
[263:29.78]Reset it.
[263:30.18]Reset it.
[263:32.76]Can't reset it.
[263:44.40]Oh my god, I just want to be just run by these guys.
[263:47.16]Because I killed them.
[263:48.80]I've already killed these guys.
[263:49.86]You know what?
[263:51.34]Just kill me.
[263:52.08]Just kill me.
[263:53.10]Do it.
[263:54.50]Do it.
[263:54.94]Fucking stab me again, please.
[263:57.53]Thank you.
[263:58.97]God.
[263:59.33]I just want to go to the bonfire.
[264:02.67]I can't touch the bonfire because this moron is just standing near it.
[264:06.79]So I might as well just die.
[264:07.77]Who cares?
[264:08.35]Pick up my souls and it doesn't even fucking matter.
[264:11.86]It seriously doesn't even matter.
[264:12.74]I'm just going to spawn right here anyways.
[264:19.30]Moronic fucking enemies.
[264:20.56]I just want to see what's in the door.
[264:31.24]That thing's going to land on me, isn't it?
[264:34.85]Isn't it?
[264:35.09]It's going to jump on me.
[264:35.87]No, it's not.
[264:54.77]Alright, Aldrich Devourer of Gods.
[264:59.03]Okay.
[264:59.23]Did he shoot mystical things at me?
[265:03.48]What's with the door?
[265:05.88]Can I, like, not do anything there?
[265:11.55]Magic defense it is.
[265:14.99]Seems to be.
[265:15.61]A lot of magic.
[265:23.27]Comes out fairly fast.
[265:27.17]Is it two times?
[265:29.92]One?
[265:31.40]Sometimes not.
[265:34.84]Those end up homing after they go in the sky.
[265:37.46]Alright.
[265:40.85]What's she doing?
[265:41.89]Oh, that's the bow and arrow move she has.
[265:48.05]She lands down on her... I gotta lock on.
[265:54.42]She flies around too?
[265:57.58]That's creepy.
[266:07.85]Whoa!
[266:08.71]She goes in the ground.
[266:10.23]Snake lady.
[266:31.17]I think you can hit her right in the back when she does that.
[266:33.89]I think.
[266:42.73]Didn't dodge through that.
[266:48.59]That's so slow, too.
[266:49.49]I just gotta wait for it.
[266:53.28]And what's the mechanic on that?
[266:54.46]Does it just go in a straight line, I guess, in an arc, so I can kind of dodge around it?
[267:01.10]In theory.
[267:15.84]I'll shoot it ahead of you.
[267:16.88]Not really.
[267:30.13]She's got fire now.
[267:31.13]I'm assuming this is phase two.
[267:34.83]She just drags fire around with her everywhere.
[267:46.50]Okay, okay
[268:04.16]No, they do follow you.
[268:05.10]They follow you around.
[268:06.65]Those are lasting so much longer than they were before.
[268:09.07]Oh, boy.
[268:09.69]Oh, boy.
[268:10.05]Oh, boy.
[268:10.33]Oh, boy.
[268:10.65]Oh, boy.
[268:10.97]Okay.
[268:11.77]Good to know.
[268:13.81]In phase two, those things last a long time.
[268:17.57]Alright.
[268:20.59]Well, let's get another attempt in here with an Ember.
[268:29.02]Put on some different gear.
[268:30.02]Some magic defense.
[268:32.18]Fire defense.
[268:35.00]Take an Ember.
[268:36.00]Let's try it again.
[268:42.27]Will this be the new Crystal Sage?
[268:43.55]I highly doubt it, considering she doesn't split into three people.
[268:49.18]Okay.
[268:49.68]Magic, magic, magic. 0.65.
[269:07.30]Actually, not terrible, the stuff I have on.
[269:13.07]I think the stuff I had on was great.
[269:19.60]Except the hat.
[269:28.38]Get these for the fire.
[269:42.93]Old sorcerer's boots.
[269:47.13]I want at least some physical defense.
[269:48.51]I don't want to get my ass kicked.
[269:49.35]What about rings?
[269:50.17]What do I got for rings?
[270:06.04]Okay.
[270:06.36]Let's get this off.
[270:09.34]I'm going to try some gold pine.
[270:11.96]Why not?
[270:17.83]Take an ember.
[270:24.41]I have my blossoms.
[270:26.92]Let's do it again.
[270:28.30]He was right behind me.
[270:53.58]These guys are in such a dumb place, right in front of the door.
[270:55.78]That sucks.
[270:57.98]Alright, let's see.
[271:23.32]Lightning doesn't seem to be doing a whole lot.
[271:25.96]I mean, it's better than before.
[271:29.91]Maybe by a little.
[271:30.63]Uh-huh.
[271:53.25]Already in fire phase.
[271:54.11]Now, she's done this for a long time.
[271:55.41]Just run around in circles.
[272:03.31]I am not sure what you do about that.
[272:04.97]I really am not sure.
[272:06.11]It's hard to gauge how to get away from that.
[272:15.34]Just doing it again.
[272:23.47]I think you just kinda have to sprint.
[272:24.95]I don't know.
[272:27.52]Because they follow you.
[272:50.95]Where are you?
[272:57.18]She goes again with the ship.
[273:04.12]Man.
[273:04.46]Not even a chance to get near her.
[273:25.04]Get closer.
[273:36.51]You know, I think it is.
[273:37.09]You just gotta get right up in her face.
[273:44.01]Yeah, that's definitely it.
[273:46.19]She's almost dead.
[273:48.37]I might not kill her this time.
[273:49.29]I might get stuck behind her.
[273:53.57]Oof, one more hit.
[273:54.69]Come here, you!
[273:55.49]Come here!
[273:56.89]Nooo!
[273:58.69]Eee!
[273:58.97]Okay.
[274:13.91]The Cinders of the Lord and Soul of Aldrich.
[274:24.33]Yeah, that wasn't... It wasn't too terrible.
[274:29.90]Just needed to kind of figure out how to avoid the super rain from above.
[274:37.84]Kim will live to mod another day.
[274:39.48]Alright, Kim.
[274:40.86]I am officially... I am officially ordering you to go take a break, go get a drink, and go to bed and study for your homework.
[274:51.48]That is a direct...
[274:54.13]Jerma president order.
[275:16.96]This is a direct president order.
[275:19.92]You gotta go relax.
[275:22.66]Just take a little bit of a break.
[275:25.23]Finish up the things you need to finish up.
[275:36.74]Nah.
[275:37.94]You do what you want.
[275:38.84]I'm kidding.
[275:39.74]But if you're tired, then you don't... We got mods.
[275:42.24]Don't worry.
[275:42.60]If you're concerned about modding... Leather is still here.
[275:48.10]I believe.
[275:50.12]Who else is still here?
[275:50.78]There's at least two or three that are still here.
[275:52.04]And it's in sub only, so don't worry about it.
[275:59.16]I don't want you to have detrimental health effects by staying up and modding this channel.
[276:05.95]Leather can hold the fort down.
[276:15.34]That's fine.
[276:15.92]This is just as long as you're not stressing yourself out.
[276:18.66]I don't want you to be stressed out about this.
[276:21.12]Don't worry.
[276:21.50]Okay.
[276:31.08]I feel like I've been neglecting strength.
[276:37.16]Is this a luck too?
[276:43.93]What do you do with luck?
[276:50.15]I might just dump them all.
[276:56.88]Yeah.
[276:57.38]We're doing a vigor dump.
[277:02.13]I wanna be health guy.
[277:14.44]Oh my god, look at the health.
[277:15.89]It's filling up the whole top of the screen.
[277:30.51]So I got a crown.
[277:31.43]I got like a cinder crown.
[277:33.61]Does that mean I have to put it on one of these graves or something?
[277:45.32]Or is there something else?
[277:48.08]Oh, you don't deserve this.
[277:49.05]All the more I can't take this.
[277:52.97]Be wary of chest.
[277:54.53]What?
[277:55.05]What chest?
[277:59.87]I can see a chest.
[278:07.83]Oh boy.
[278:11.11]There is that.
[278:28.99]Wasn't I up here before?
[278:29.83]Didn't I clear out some people or something?
[278:38.17]No, this is not where the guys are shooting the bows and arrows.
[278:40.91]Alright.
[278:51.02]Is this pointless?
[278:52.06]Come over here?
[278:52.64]Or am I going to be told?
[278:53.70]Liar!
[278:58.54]Looks like it was pointless.
[279:01.88]Unless one of these is an illusory wall.
[279:08.61]Whatever.
[279:09.83]Let's go.
[279:19.43]Bonfire?
[279:21.02]No chest ahead in short time for sadness.
[279:24.60]People talking about chest, no chest.
[279:26.10]What is this?
[279:26.72]No chest ahead.
[279:28.92]Praise the chest.
[279:30.96]No chest.
[279:31.64]Stay calm.
[279:38.53]Sun princess ring.
[279:44.25]What are you guys talking about?
[279:46.29]No chest.
[279:48.51]Gradually restores HP.
[279:51.31]I'm sorry.
[279:51.67]I bumped the mic.
[280:00.45]I guess I could take this off.
[280:03.85]I might want to put this on.
[280:04.73]Boost attack when HP is full.
[280:08.79]Might be worth it.
[280:14.98]Okay.
[280:15.22]You want to go to packs, but you don't want to justify the money.
[280:26.17]Yeah, it's a lot of money.
[280:30.32]When I go to PAX Prime, it's like... You know, the $300 or $400 for the plane ride, and then, like, hundreds of dollars a night.
[280:38.20]It ends up being, like, at least $1,000.
[280:43.48]Food, eating out every single night for, like, four days.
[280:46.64]It adds up.
[281:01.04]Well, I guess I'm gonna go back to town and I got like a cinder crown.
[281:07.71]They can do something with it here.
[281:18.54]In Dark Souls 1, there is... Yeah, Dark Souls 1 and I have a very odd relationship where I never beat it.
[281:26.10]I got to Blighttown.
[281:28.12]I beat Blighttown.
[281:30.26]Completed all of Blighttown.
[281:32.33]And then realized that I had to turn around and backtrack through all of Blighttown again.
[281:37.85]And never played the game ever again.
[281:43.47]I did beat Dark Souls 2, though.
[281:46.49]Pretty big, I know.
[281:48.15]Dark Souls 2 I beat from start to finish.
[281:50.86]Actually, like, a few days ago.
[281:52.20]Like, days before this came out, I beat Dark Souls 2.
[281:55.26]I played it from start to finish.
[281:59.42]Jeremy eats out every single night.
[282:00.70]Only when I'm on, like, vacation.
[282:01.89]Because when am I going to, like, go cook in somebody's shop?
[282:05.11]Shop.
[282:07.63]Um... Who do I give this to?
[282:10.95]Let me see what it even says.
[282:15.66]Where is it?
[282:22.88]I guess I can see what the Eldritch Stone gets me.
[282:37.25]What does that stone do?
[282:40.70]Wow, almost just accidentally bought that.
[282:48.76]Aster's Spear.
[282:49.64]It's a skill weapon.
[282:54.04]Looks kind of cool.
[282:59.60]Farron, greatsword.
[283:03.72]Crystal hail or aster spear, which we are using the katana still.
[283:17.40]Smash it.
[283:30.63]10,000!
[283:30.75]What was that?
[283:33.58]Holy smokes.
[283:35.66]Get this to 30, and then I'll work on other stuff.
[283:58.65]I failed to thank you for helping them find their final resting place.
[284:05.27]Farron Ring?
[284:08.01]Who's he talking about?
[284:09.07]I pity the sorry souls.
[284:11.66]Is that really Lordship's last reward?
[284:16.84]What, did I kill somebody he wanted to be killed?
[284:18.60]What is that?
[284:20.72]Farron Ring.
[284:21.90]Let's take a look.
[284:26.96]Where is it?
[284:29.78]Everything is a sorcery ring.
[284:42.41]What do I do with this crown?
[284:46.79]Read engraving.
[284:47.51]Watchers of the Abyss.
[284:48.51]Okay.
[284:54.13]So I do have to put them on the
[284:56.74]So those are the Watchers.
[284:57.82]What about anyone in this one over here?
[284:59.68]No.
[285:10.93]Oh, so he's like an Olympus Watcher.
[285:14.18]Cool.
[285:14.98]Well, hasn't it been some time?
[285:18.89]I'm Leonard.
[285:19.87]Remember me?
[285:21.31]I slipped you those red eyes some time ago.
[285:23.49]I do remember.
[285:24.11]You're making quite an effort of it, so I thought you might like to know.
[285:27.65]If you yearn for a proper red eye orb, one that is uncracked, then kill the dark wraith, survivor of the man swallowed by darkness.
[285:36.92]He has been a prisoner for many ages in the deepest cell in all Lothric.
[285:45.80]I think you got a bad reading on me, dude.
[285:51.52]That's not me at all.
[285:53.76]Oh, I can go down in a cell and kill a dude for this guy?
[285:59.46]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[286:03.18]Holy King Lothric.
[286:06.37]So, what do I have?
[286:08.33]I don't have King Lothric's brain.
[286:13.63]Maybe I have this brain.
[286:15.07]I do.
[286:22.13]St.
[286:22.45]Aldrich of the Deep, yeah?
[286:23.87]Alright, well.
[286:25.83]There's two more.
[286:34.63]I am not entirely sure where to go.
[286:41.26]Maybe she can tell me something.
[286:43.19]You're not very helpful.
[286:45.09]Alright, where did I not go?
[286:47.23]Just take a look.
[286:48.74]I mean, there is here.
[287:13.35]And wasn't there one back here?
[287:14.81]I didn't do.
[287:16.21]I guess we'll just go over this way into Profane Capital.
[287:23.78]See where it takes us.
[287:33.33]I got all the way here and chickened out, so.
[287:38.61]Whatever.
[287:41.75]I can take these clothes off now.
[287:46.13]Get what I was wearing back on my... Fallen Knight stuff.
[287:59.91]Nameless Knight or Fallen Knight?
[288:04.04]Fallen Knight.
[288:12.61]Silver Knight?
[288:15.17]Where's Fallen Knight?
[288:19.17]Silver Knight's a little better.
[288:19.97]Yeah, I'm gonna keep Silver Knight on.
[288:27.47]Cool.
[288:28.53]Let's go.
[288:38.42]Wait a minute.
[288:39.08]Something ain't right.
[288:42.44]Heavy rolling right now.
[288:49.02]What weighs that much?
[288:49.82]I guess they weigh a little too much.
[289:01.19]Whatever.
[289:03.61]Oh, well.
[289:05.63]Let's see who's down here.
[289:24.50]It's a dangerous drop.
[289:26.58]Not doing it.
[289:33.64]Maybe you can.
[289:34.54]Isn't there a ring that makes you not take fall damage?
[289:36.22]Probably can just leap over there and not take fall damage.
[289:49.80]What's the tip?
[289:51.44]Be wary of bonfire, you bastard.
[289:55.13]I wonder if you can say bastard in this game.
[289:59.81]Whoa.
[290:01.47]Whoa.
[290:02.77]Dragon man.
[290:11.14]Shit.
[290:14.34]Shit.
[290:36.81]No, I didn't want to kick.
[290:47.95]Um, which way?
[290:53.68]Which way?
[290:59.60]This way.
[291:08.16]Evil hiding behind every corner.
[291:10.14]Jewel bug.
[291:11.58]Jewel bug, jewel bug, jewel bug.
[291:12.70]You thought you were in it and you didn't get me.
[291:18.86]I even saw it coming too.
[291:19.86]I even saw it coming from a mile away.
[291:27.78]I didn't make the jump.
[291:29.60]I'm probably dead.
[291:31.07]Because there are 200 enemies over here.
[291:36.95]Oh, now there's 300.
[291:41.49]It's gonna be 400 in a second.
[291:42.36]There's a bonfire in here, I think.
[291:57.31]Nope, it's just some kind of door.
[292:08.41]Oh dear goodness.
[292:10.89]Oh dear.
[292:13.17]Hand monsters.
[292:17.05]Is there anything else in this room?
[292:24.27]Oh, I'm getting crushed by the hand monster.
[292:29.59]What a weird enemy.
[292:36.88]Okay.
[292:52.07]Okay.
[293:01.46]What is this?
[293:01.90]Ah, real monsters?
[293:03.92]Isn't there a hand guy in that?
[293:05.04]There was a hand guy, wasn't there?
[293:09.85]It was Ickis?
[293:12.71]Who was the other one?
[293:13.23]It was Ickis, and there was a girl, and there was the guy with the hand.
[293:17.09]Hand eyes.
[293:25.01]Okay, this time, let's see if I can make this jump.
[293:31.88]So I don't have to go down there.
[293:36.98]Theoretically.
[293:38.00]That's a trap I didn't step on.
[293:40.60]Good for me.
[293:41.38]Good for you.
[293:42.16]You did it.
[293:42.64]Good for you.
[293:45.01]Good work.
[293:45.49]Good for you.
[294:06.60]I don't have any items that need to use those, by the way.
[294:15.37]This dragon, man.
[294:16.23]Do I have to go down to the swamp?
[294:22.73]Or is there an escape route here?
[294:31.40]Oh, for the love of fucking... Oh, that is sacred.
[294:33.94]I...
[294:38.40]I guess I... I don't know.
[294:39.40]Whatever.
[294:39.80]I'm sick of the poison gem that I'm not gonna use.
[294:50.98]There's a ring.
[294:57.06]You know what?
[294:57.49]I've had enough of your shit.
[295:23.25]I'm toxic.
[295:24.05]I don't want to move around the swamp this slowly.
[295:40.44]Alright.
[295:41.88]At least I can take a second to look around.
[295:45.36]What's a purging stone?
[295:46.20]Is that going to get rid of poison?
[295:50.00]Whatever I just do this this is not gonna help it all is it yeah, that's not poison.
[295:53.82]It's toxic This is not a poison swamp it's a toxic swamp there's a difference One hit thank God I can kill these guys in one hit when they don't get up
[296:30.85]Go that way.
[296:31.53]Just want to make sure I don't miss anything.
[296:33.03]I kind of want to go back in the hand room and make sure I didn't forget to do something.
[296:37.97]Alright.
[296:48.79]Back into hand room.
[296:56.09]These guys seem pretty docile, so I might be able to take one out at a time.
[297:04.16]I have a lot of health.
[297:05.78]They're like hippos.
[297:09.38]These are hippopotamuses with hands for faces.
[297:25.07]Yeah.
[297:31.96]Here comes the other one.
[297:34.64]Just shit.
[297:35.40]All they have is shit.
[297:37.64]Losing a lot of health from being toxic.
[297:57.71]Hold on, let me... There was another one in here.
[298:00.13]Shit!
[298:01.19]I thought there was only two.
[298:02.33]Anything in here?
[298:06.96]That just looked like I went through the wall, didn't it?
[298:15.04]I really don't think there's anything in here worth staying for.
[298:18.76]And I'm toxic.
[298:19.64]I'm gonna die from the toxic.
[298:30.99]Uh, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic?
[298:34.99]Reduces under the curse build up and cures ho- wait, no.
[298:47.26]I thought I had something.
[298:54.79]Bear of the curse.
[299:10.41]listen to me son I'm your dad why is that in my head right now I don't think there's any real reason to keep going down here but I want my souls because there was a lot of souls that I lost
[299:34.99]Although, might be worth seeing with upstairs.
[299:39.21]Sorry for the sibilance.
[299:40.09]No, there's no reason to.
[299:49.71]I'm just gonna fall down.
[299:51.67]Whoops!
[300:04.92]Oh, you have a tiny little bit of HP left.
[300:09.40]No, you don't.
[300:16.44]Two birds and one stone.
[300:25.91]Give me my souls.
[300:26.53]Get me out of here.
[300:27.03]I've been doing a lot of that lately, too.
[300:30.11]Let's say I... You know, I'm gonna...
[300:40.18]I'm going to go up there.
[300:48.16]There's a ladder over there.
[300:50.59]Oh boy, a ladder.
[300:52.25]I'm so happy to see this.
[301:24.37]I need to look and make sure I don't have something I can get really toxic with.
[301:27.96]I didn't discovery.
[301:32.94]That's just recovery.
[301:35.42]I can't smear pool of myself.
[301:36.82]No.
[301:39.82]Listen to me, son.
[301:43.07]I'm your dad.
[301:48.91]Hey, Fox.
[301:51.96]Destroy him.
[301:55.32]Fox881.
[301:56.10]Hopefully there was nobody before you, Fox, that I missed, but welcome.
[302:01.30]Thanks for stopping.
[302:02.74]You are... Holy shit.
[302:06.56]I'm not supposed to be swearing.
[302:32.96]Got ya.
[302:36.52]Mr. Logan.
[302:40.23]Logan!
[302:44.05]Try rolling.
[302:46.95]Not yet.
[302:47.35]I'm just burning through estuses because of toxic buildup.
[302:52.78]I have too much plaque.
[302:55.64]Too much plaque on my teeth.
[302:56.96]It's building up.
[303:03.71]Bridgley's over there.
[303:04.77]I don't know what that is.
[303:05.73]I don't know.
[303:13.14]I have no idea.
[303:14.12]I'm not sure why.
[303:20.24]Starting to talk like Mike from Breaking Bad.
[303:25.42]Listen, if you want the poison, Walter, you're gonna have to just go for it.
[303:32.08]The thing told you to try rolling.
[303:34.72]You might want to try doing that.
[303:37.19]Okay.
[303:39.63]Good job, Walter.
[303:40.61]You got it.
[303:41.25]Is that chest breathing?
[303:52.40]Let's get a closer look.
[304:08.26]Enemy ahead.
[304:10.25]Shit, it wasn't even breathing!
[304:11.83]Wasn't even breathing.
[304:30.72]Wasn't even breathing.
[304:36.24]Wasn't even breathing.
[304:45.10]Was it really?
[304:45.86]Am I just losing my mind?
[304:46.82]I'm losing my sight?
[304:47.71]Okay, there's an item, but there's a hippo.
[304:53.03]There's two items here.
[304:53.97]I can go item, item, avoid hippo.
[304:56.43]I can actually keep going over here, too.
[305:02.66]Good.
[305:03.06]Glad I picked that up for no reason.
[305:09.92]Uh...
[305:13.07]I hate when you actually swing through it.
[305:15.65]Rather than bouncing off it.
[305:16.77]Because I keep feeling like I'm supposed to be going through the wall.
[305:21.98]You don't even see that?
[305:23.58]I just was like, yeah, I got one.
[305:25.08]Invisible wall.
[305:25.84]Got it.
[305:29.42]Did that wake the hippo up?
[305:31.67]Because I was hitting the wall down there.
[305:35.41]Was I really hitting the wall, though?
[305:39.50]You hit the Walter too hard.
[305:41.10]That means you can't sell the drugs.
[305:46.34]Or whatever you're trying to do.
[305:47.52]Start circling around.
[305:52.28]No, I'm going this way.
[305:57.57]You can do what you want.
[305:59.79]With me.
[306:00.25]Is this where I came from?
[306:05.61]It is.
[306:08.43]Is he trying to go through the window?
[306:09.65]He's trying to just break through the window.
[306:18.31]Am I done here?
[306:19.03]I might be done here.
[306:26.93]Oh, I guess I can go this way.
[306:36.87]Back up to this dungeon.
[306:46.77]The fuck?
[306:48.97]What?
[306:50.15]What on Earth?
[306:54.86]There is no... There is no s- My fate... is inevitable.
[307:20.52]I don't know.
[307:26.60]That didn't make any sense.
[307:31.59]Two invisible guys.
[307:33.79]Those guys were never invisible.
[307:39.77]That's the funny thing about all that.
[307:44.64]I'm gonna puke.
[307:54.47]Okay, whatever you say, let's-a go, let's-a play.
[307:57.46]Okay, whatever you say, let's-a go, let's-a play.
[308:23.16]Let's-a go, let's-a play.
[308:26.24]Wherever you go, wherever you say.
[308:27.94]Was there a patch today?
[308:33.68]I don't think there was.
[308:38.63]Because they didn't patch out any of the trees.
[308:43.77]Absolutely should have been patched out.
[308:48.63]So let's see that again.
[308:51.41]Yeah.
[308:54.77]Let's I'm gonna bump move around yeah, they're right here.
[308:57.32]I'm bumping into them.
[308:59.92]I'm walking directly into them right now I Can't believe this I Kind of I want to kill them now because why would they ever be here unless they drop something I?
[309:25.23]No, they're just here for no reason.
[309:29.90]They don't serve any purpose.
[309:41.11]Let's see there.
[309:41.93]Give me my souls.
[309:58.47]That's I was up top before there and there's his weight down Maybe I just don't have maybe I won't wake him up Did he wake up he's up
[310:27.44]four Titanite shards that was only slightly worth it maybe I don't know where this leads is that a seriously another mimic chest like what are they all why there's so many of these
[311:07.09]Shit.
[311:07.41]I just got booted right in the fucking head.
[311:18.66]No, really?
[311:19.88]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[311:23.94]Like... I'm so concerned about the toxic buildup that I'm just gonna die from this thing.
[311:30.92]Toxic lasts, what is that, like five minutes?
[311:37.97]Seriously, that lasts such a stupid amount of time.
[311:41.63]And is there any way I can get rid of it?
[311:42.97]Can I just, can I get rid of that?
[311:46.39]I just have to stay like that for five straight minutes.
[312:00.18]It's just dumb.
[312:05.46]That is what we call a stupid thing that's in this game.
[312:12.19]Because they have to have poison, but they also have to have toxic.
[312:17.60]Like, would you fuck off with that shit?
[312:34.66]Slowly take a bunch of damage over the next five straight minutes or longer.
[312:39.67]It might even be ten minutes.
[313:14.74]Cry, baby.
[313:15.90]This, like, look at how long this is.
[313:17.92]Does it have to be this long?
[313:21.12]You're gonna use every Estus Flask to not die by Toxic.
[313:38.33]And there's no way for me to cure it in my inventory.
[313:40.29]I just have to let it keep eating me.
[313:45.65]Game sucks.
[313:47.73]Game sucks.
[313:48.83]Game sucks.
[313:53.42]Watch out, watch out for these invisible guys!
[314:08.35]I'm going this way.
[314:22.17]Shrine Maiden isn't in his inventory.
[314:40.49]Thank God I got rid of that stupid dumb thing.
[314:44.55]And now I'm back up to... This is maybe a wraparound.
[314:48.46]I mean, I guess I could go try to fight the mimic chest again.
[314:59.94]Top five.
[315:05.46]Top five list.
[315:06.46]Top five list.
[315:07.52]Top five plays of the week.
[315:14.81]Oh, game hanged a little there.
[315:18.05]Game hanged.
[315:18.91]Looks like these rats are gonna... Yeah, they are.
[315:30.34]Oh, you just came out of the... You came out of the corpses, man.
[315:58.29]Out of my face.
[316:04.09]All that for lightning arrows, which I don't want, don't want, don't want.
[316:13.11]What's my true opinion of the game?
[316:15.96]I think it's great.
[316:17.82]I think it's really really fun.
[316:23.29]It's extremely engaging.
[316:24.71]It's, I think, the hardest out of all the games in the Souls series.
[316:34.47]Playing through Dark Souls 2 was not as punishing as playing through this.
[316:39.32]I can tell you that for certain.
[316:42.26]A lot of the enemies in Dark Souls 2 are pretty brainless.
[316:46.30]Enemies in this game are on top of their game.
[316:58.84]I just went all the way up to go all the way down.
[317:06.39]What?
[317:06.89]What?
[317:07.05]Did I?
[317:07.27]Huh?
[317:07.37]Did I just get turned around up there?
[317:14.01]Harder than Demon's Souls?
[317:14.75]I actually never played Demon's Souls.
[317:15.91]I didn't have a PS3 when it came out.
[317:21.39]It'd be nice if they did something for PS4.
[317:24.56]Where you could get Demon's soulslike an HD remaster or something.
[317:29.15]Okay, there's a little tiny area to go through.
[317:38.48]Jeez.
[317:41.28]We're going for it.
[317:42.06]Time to jump.
[317:45.77]Lightning bolts.
[317:56.20]There's something huge behind me, aren't there?
[317:59.40]No, I've been here.
[318:01.92]This is the I Am Alive section.
[318:10.55]Is there a boss over here?
[318:12.15]Or... Is this just kind of leading to another area?
[318:16.86]I don't know.
[318:24.67]Is there a boss over here?
[318:29.14]Let me deal with these guys.
[318:31.80]Nice masks.
[318:34.00]I look way better in it.
[318:35.12]I did get a jail key or something, didn't I?
[318:42.16]Maybe I should go back to the jail cells.
[318:53.45]Where is this going to take me?
[319:04.74]I just don't have any idea.
[319:08.68]Because I remember going by his hand.
[319:12.88]Did I go this way?
[319:16.28]I don't think so.
[319:26.29]No, maybe I did.
[319:37.77]Ladder.
[319:39.73]Go free the lizard, baby.
[319:42.67]Good.
[319:44.03]No, I definitely didn't come up here.
[319:45.67]Because I was not this close to his head.
[319:51.12]No, I was.
[319:51.68]I'm just going to go back through this way, I guess.
[320:05.69]I have like three jail cell keys.
[320:08.97]I'm gonna try using them.
[320:24.06]Come on, give me some slack.
[320:24.92]This place is kind of confusing.
[320:26.22]There's like a place to drop and a place to go and things to open everywhere.
[320:30.55]I might just go back to the bonfire and go to the jail.
[320:38.00]Be very monster.
[320:39.12]What was over this way?
[320:40.12]Yeah, because I'm back at this stage.
[320:44.44]Man, this is like so many levels.
[320:54.69]It's 200 feet up and 200 feet down.
[320:55.51]What's down there?
[321:09.32]I might just fucking jump.
[321:13.00]I'm gonna jump.
[321:16.10]After I level up.
[321:17.02]At least I'm back at the cells.
[321:37.57]Got behind him, I at least teleported into his room.
[321:53.50]Hi!
[321:57.43]Alright, well, I freed you.
[322:07.81]Can I open this door now?
[322:10.01]Are you gonna let me move through this way?
[322:11.59]Not locked on.
[322:19.28]I missed.
[322:26.60]Oh, I missed again.
[322:28.96]You gotta be far away.
[322:32.24]Please do the jumping attack or I will scream.
[322:48.31]If this doesn't open that door, I'm in deep shit.
[322:55.27]Nope.
[322:58.44]Nope.
[322:59.64]I'm not even in deep shit.
[323:00.52]I'm okay.
[323:15.11]Yeah, go ahead, dude.
[323:16.11]Brand me.
[323:29.59]I'm just going to leave you to that.
[323:36.47]Make sure he's in your mother's bed.
[323:39.41]I will.
[323:50.33]The doors that I couldn't get to.
[323:56.01]Old jailer key.
[324:12.22]I just don't want to miss anything.
[324:29.19]Take it out.
[324:30.53]Alright, if you don't do it, then I will.
[324:43.18]I'm gonna need to go home soon.
[324:44.50]I kinda knew you were there too.
[325:15.05]You on the other hand There we go Rusted gold coin
[325:42.23]A rusted gold coin.
[325:45.61]What a great thing to come all the way back here for.
[325:52.24]A rusted gold coin.
[326:34.18]Barred windows?
[326:45.78]I feel like there was a door that I needed to open here.
[326:48.62]I remember like it was a cell door.
[326:55.27]It had bars on it.
[327:01.04]He's guarded by a warden.
[327:09.26]There's a door.
[327:12.60]He's being guarded.
[327:13.40]What?
[327:15.03]Oh, by note!
[327:15.53]How many people liked it?
[327:16.61]I'm going back here now.
[327:38.56]Well, I'm officially lost.
[327:43.97]It's official.
[327:44.51]I have no idea where to go.
[327:46.21]Let me just take a look at my keys again.
[327:53.45]It's the doll.
[327:59.46]Yeah, these are not anything important.
[328:03.99]Jailbreakers key.
[328:06.03]Key to the barred window of... Did I already use this?
[328:09.28]I don't think so.
[328:11.50]Well, I mean, it's in this dungeon somewhere.
[328:22.07]Do you want to know it's stupid?
[328:24.57]I mean, you're stupid.
[328:28.84]That was not a good joke at all.
[328:30.28]In fact, that was... Woosh!
[328:34.03]Way over my head.
[328:36.97]Is it really stupid?
[328:40.45]I mean, just... I don't want any spoilers or anything.
[328:43.91]Am I in the right spot?
[328:45.34]I don't want any spoilers.
[328:47.76]Don't spoil anything.
[328:48.60]That's the whole reason why I don't want any spoilers.
[328:50.82]Am I in the right place?
[328:51.82]I mean...
[328:56.39]Don't spoil anything for me.
[328:57.36]We're going the right way.
[328:58.00]Let me look back.
[329:28.60]It's definitely in your little dungeon.
[329:39.69]I have a lot of keys for this little dungeon.
[329:46.77]Don't tell me anything.
[329:47.79]Don't tell me.
[329:48.37]I have a bunch of keys for this place.
[329:51.29]I just need to find the right door and open it and touch a button or something.
[329:57.18]So we're going to just pretend like we just got to this dungeon for the first time.
[330:00.38]Because this is the way that I walked.
[330:02.64]Whoa, man.
[330:03.10]This is a creepy dungeon.
[330:05.34]Look at all this new stuff that's here.
[330:07.20]What's that enemy?
[330:07.86]Whoa, he's got like a cow branding device?
[330:11.61]That's crazy.
[330:13.43]I like this area.
[330:14.31]It's kind of scary.
[330:23.75]I would have...
[330:24.93]bet all my chickens that it would have been that door that I couldn't open from that side remember this guy so not fair that you can throw your all your body through the walls but I bounce off of it not fair
[331:07.76]Lay down.
[331:16.07]Stare up at the ceiling.
[331:19.25]For 40 minutes.
[331:36.38]Be wary of the left.
[331:38.00]Okay.
[331:38.77]Any doors over there?
[331:48.45]It was like a corner.
[331:52.12]I remember it being on a corner.
[332:05.62]Is this it?
[332:06.82]Okay, Jailer Ring Key.
[332:07.72]Got it.
[332:08.93]What's in here?
[332:11.43]Prisoner's Sheave.
[332:12.19]It's just ashes.
[332:12.89]I mean, that's cool.
[332:15.97]That's good that I got that, but... It doesn't really help me in progressing through this game, now does it?
[332:33.62]What are more uses?
[332:35.38]What does that key have?
[332:38.14]Barred up door.
[332:47.31]Already been down there.
[332:48.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[332:58.41]No.
[333:00.89]I thought that was going to be it.
[333:09.69]Cool to get those items, but it's also at the same time not cool.
[333:17.05]Where was the baby?
[333:18.88]The babies in the cells.
[333:24.80]Simple gem.
[333:39.67]Nice push.
[333:42.09]I shoved him, guys.
[333:42.93]I'm just back where I started.
[333:51.26]Wasn't that door.
[333:51.98]I opened two separate doors now.
[333:53.30]Let me look.
[333:57.09]I'm going to go across again.
[334:07.20]Oh, he's starting a Jupiter.
[334:08.64]He's starting the Jupiter chant.
[334:42.35]Oh, fuck.
[334:43.19]Oh, fuck.
[334:43.99]Oh, fuck.
[334:47.49]I'm really surprised it's not that.
[334:56.72]Like I said, I would have bet all my chickens that it was going to be this door.
[335:01.72]But it's not.
[335:02.18]I have to wrap around that somehow this way?
[335:06.94]Drop down through like a fucking hole or something?
[335:14.07]I can't believe all my chickens are gone.
[335:18.71]I would have put them all on the line there.
[335:22.05]I don't know why this doesn't work for me sometimes.
[335:33.98]I'm doing it exactly the same every single time.
[335:41.51]Complain, complain.
[335:42.39]Game sucks.
[335:47.18]Here are the baby people again.
[336:20.64]Hmm.
[336:56.16]I'm way overleveled.
[336:57.14]Maybe for this area, yeah, because I've just been walking around in a circle.
[337:03.45]I was here, like, seven hours ago.
[337:08.80]And I got a key to come back here, and I just don't know which one of these, like, how to, where do I go?
[337:50.43]Do you feel like you beat the game at a lower level?
[338:02.60]You play the game how the fuck you want.
[338:04.70]I play the game how I want.
[338:08.84]I've been spending a lot of time walking around looking at stuff.
[338:26.81]Let's just walk over here.
[338:27.93]That goes up, right?
[338:47.80]Alright.
[338:48.44]I've yet to solve the mystery that is what direction do you have to go in?
[338:56.89]I might just go back to the last bonfire I was at.
[339:09.70]And maybe run by and go into... To, like, anything else over here.
[339:16.39]What about, like, down here?
[339:17.61]I mean, like, I was already down there.
[339:34.19]I don't know.
[339:36.33]I legit have no idea.
[339:37.71]I don't know why I said that.
[339:39.43]I thought I'd give you that.
[339:40.05]I want the bug.
[339:40.56]It's gonna kill me, but I don't care.
[339:43.08]Give it to me.
[339:49.80]Titanite chunk.
[339:50.44]I actually need one of those.
[339:51.32]I wish we'd get off the screen.
[340:09.62]What's up there?
[340:10.34]No.
[340:12.62]It's like the rats.
[340:13.67]I remember the rats.
[340:16.27]There was a mimic chest up here, wasn't there?
[340:18.19]I'm out of Estus Blasts now.
[340:21.25]For the love of God.
[340:35.44]Maybe there's a door.
[340:37.30]Oh!
[340:39.44]No, shit, I thought that was a door.
[340:42.24]I thought this was going to be a door when I got up here.
[340:45.97]Is this a mimic chest?
[340:48.51]Oh, shit in my pants.
[340:52.17]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[340:58.52]I don't think I have enough time to bone it up.
[341:09.27]Good bone out.
[341:12.25]There's the giant rats.
[341:15.97]Was there... Oh, wait a minute.
[341:17.81]I remember being down here.
[341:20.91]Was there something down here?
[341:24.60]Isn't there another... Please, giant rat, get away.
[341:30.52]I'm like... I haven't even been here before.
[341:34.58]Giant rat, please.
[341:35.54]Please.
[341:38.25]Like, where is this?
[341:39.69]Where is this going to go?
[341:41.47]Get out of my way, please.
[341:46.69]Okay.
[341:59.66]This is important that I stay alive here.
[342:09.07]Okay, I opened this door.
[342:10.17]It doesn't really help me.
[342:20.11]I mean, the bonfire is over there.
[342:21.41]I'm just gonna, you know, whatever.
[342:23.36]Okay, I could get that item, too.
[342:30.90]Yeah, give me the item.
[342:33.76]Let's get it.
[342:34.66]Come here, get it.
[342:42.30]Lightning blade.
[342:43.06]Looks like a lot of people have died over here.
[343:05.75]Try jet, what is there, covenant here?
[343:08.30]So maybe if I keep progressing that way there'll be a door to push open?
[343:11.86]I don't know.
[343:16.50]I don't fucking know.
[343:20.80]But there are more doors to potentially open over here.
[343:22.92]I do remember this because there was like seven of these guys here.
[343:31.07]I'm probably, I'm just gonna die.
[343:34.05]At least I know I can get back here quickly.
[343:36.33]That just killed me.
[343:36.97]I don't care at this point.
[343:51.26]For some reason, I thought there was going to be something easier.
[343:53.38]I'm going to just turn around and go right through the door.
[344:10.79]Wait, wait, where is the door?
[344:17.25]Where is that door?
[344:19.50]Wasn't it like right there?
[344:20.44]I thought it was like literally you take a right and it's right there.
[344:28.20]I guess not.
[344:28.86]It's the other side, I think.
[344:31.10]I don't know.
[344:31.52]I know I'm dead.
[344:33.70]Figaro, Figaro, Fig...
[345:07.12]20k is nothing.
[345:08.42]Really?
[345:08.84]You have to sprint it around the corner.
[345:11.40]It doesn't do that.
[345:19.13]It's across the bridge, isn't it?
[345:21.27]Can I please have my health back?
[345:46.07]It's not that way.
[345:46.73]Alright, I... There it is.
[345:57.35]Gee, I was gonna say, I feel like I'm going crazy.
[345:59.39]It's on the lower level on the other side.
[346:32.17]Hmm.
[346:35.09]There's a door up there.
[346:35.99]There's a giant rat over there.
[346:56.35]Hmm.
[346:56.53]There's a door right here.
[347:00.15]I mean, I might just die from this, but... There's a door right here.
[347:06.17]This is... Look at the troop behind... Can I close the door behind me?
[347:09.77]Oh, okay.
[347:10.39]Hurry it up.
[347:11.15]Mm-hmm.
[347:11.88]Anything else?
[347:12.34]Monstrosities, and I have no exception.
[347:14.06]Okay.
[347:14.18]Uh...
[347:30.75]Sure.
[347:32.82]You're here to save me?
[347:34.08]Yeah.
[347:36.30]But I'm guilty.
[347:38.58]A wretched child of the abyss.
[347:40.10]I'm just going to drink in front of you.
[347:42.22]Is that something you can forgive?
[347:43.76]Uh... You did a bunch of bad stuff.
[347:51.00]Everyone deserves a second chance.
[347:52.24]Oh, really?
[347:54.40]You are no ordinary man.
[347:58.28]Very well.
[348:04.23]I did it.
[348:04.61]Oh, that's an NPC.
[348:13.56]I guess there's an NPC over there.
[348:15.32]No, I don't think there's any things to open.
[348:17.22]Alright, because this is where I ended up.
[348:37.76]Unless there's another door over here, which I don't know of.
[348:39.58]Which I don't think there is.
[348:48.25]I want to get down there.
[348:53.83]I want to go... Fuck, I forgot about this, dude.
[349:11.43]I'm going to go down and see if I can find a way to sneak around there.
[349:14.53]It looked like I could go down a ladder on the edge.
[349:23.69]Let me look at that again.
[349:30.12]How much longer am I going to stream for?
[349:33.30]Until I get to the next area, at least.
[349:35.66]I want to find the next spot I have to go to.
[349:45.82]Fuck.
[349:47.08]I need to get that.
[349:47.50]I want to get that.
[349:47.96]I saw your mama let you come out and play today.
[350:04.99]I saw your mama let you come out and play today.
[350:15.31]It's the purpose of this diving board.
[350:29.73]This guy's trying to do it too.
[350:31.43]We're both doing the same thing.
[350:40.81]Let's see what he does.
[350:41.47]Here he goes again.
[350:43.21]Let's watch him.
[350:48.58]I think he gave up.
[350:51.29]Try rolling this time.
[351:09.84]I don't care.
[351:10.44]I'm done.
[351:13.16]I'm done with that.
[351:34.23]Let's try to get down.
[351:36.81]Let's see if I can make a jump over here.
[351:45.15]Hey.
[351:48.29]Not cool.
[351:50.41]Hey, not cool.
[351:56.51]What?
[351:57.29]That looked like a spot I could jump to.
[351:59.83]What?
[352:04.76]Come on.
[352:12.71]There's a ledge.
[352:13.51]I can stand on this one, but not that one.
[352:19.09]They're like the same texture.
[352:21.17]I can't make that to over there?
[352:22.99]Okay.
[352:23.50]Well, whatever.
[352:24.14]I could just walk.
[352:32.90]I could walk.
[352:40.79]I believe I found the correct way to go and it wasn't even in the dungeon.
[352:51.99]This looks brand new to me.
[352:56.29]Please tell me you can't get through this door.
[352:57.71]He's trying.
[353:10.62]New enemies.
[353:15.96]Alright, one of them has a knife.
[353:18.22]These guys are shooting fire.
[353:27.75]Oh shit, and there's a dragon dude over there.
[353:42.36]That'll keep you comboed.
[353:43.50]New dagger.
[353:52.04]Handmaiden's dagger.
[354:00.89]E and E. Blind spot.
[354:07.10]Just gonna look at it.
[354:13.59]That's weird.
[354:17.49]Okie dokie.
[354:22.42]Whoa, that was a fast move.
[354:55.94]Creepy stuff around these parts.
[355:04.11]Boss.
[355:15.83]Am I interrupting something?
[355:16.89]Sorry.
[355:37.98]I feel like there's probably a bonfire closer to this.
[355:42.67]And I should investigate a little further.
[355:48.03]And I do hear loud noises.
[355:53.13]Noises are getting even louder.
[355:55.76]They're getting louder.
[355:59.48]Where's the giant guy?
[356:00.86]Where's the guy that's gonna just jump on the bridge and plummet me?
[356:28.34]A rusted coin.
[356:34.64]Well, whatever.
[356:35.28]Yeah, once I get to the next bonfire, the next zone, I need to get to, like, a bonfire before I'm safe.
[356:45.67]I'll run into the boss room for a few minutes.
[356:49.61]And go from there.
[356:53.55]Assuming there is a closer bonfire.
[357:07.15]Let's check.
[357:10.87]Any dudes in the wall?
[357:12.33]I see a big scary guy, maybe.
[357:14.03]There's a bunch of chests in here.
[357:19.59]And one of those people.
[357:24.05]I think he just landed.
[357:28.35]He did.
[357:48.79]Are you going to stay de-aggroed?
[357:57.29]I might just say whatever and go through and start again tomorrow.
[358:04.85]Because I'm getting tired.
[358:09.52]Just to see where the boss even is.
[358:10.94]Because I didn't see a potential place to hit a bonfire over there.
[358:17.27]Well, you know, I could be wrong, but I don't think I am.
[358:20.26]I think he was pretty much priority number one.
[358:50.13]Need stamina.
[358:52.16]Okay.
[359:30.49]Come on down.
[359:49.44]Oh, you missed too.
[359:50.20]It's okay.
[359:50.40]Die.
[359:57.61]Die.
[359:58.63]Die.
[360:07.22]What else is in here?
[360:12.52]No mini cry ahead.
[360:14.19]Well, thank you.
[360:14.85]That's good to know.
[360:40.57]You're gonna make me fight a mimic again.
[360:41.97]You're gonna make me fight another mimic.
[360:45.61]Well, this one's not a mimic.
[360:49.01]I can see that one's breathing and it's ugly.
[360:52.09]Wait a minute.
[360:54.28]Oh, they're both mimics.
[360:56.94]Jeez.
[360:58.38]Two of them?
[360:58.90]Well, I don't want to get them both, so I gotta be real careful.
[361:23.05]He's doing the soccer kick.
[361:30.65]Two rusted gold coins.
[361:31.84]You guys keep giving me these gold coins.
[361:42.08]He did a spin kick.
[361:44.41]That's different.
[361:59.90]No!
[362:00.70]What?
[362:02.96]He just like glued to my body.
[362:06.90]What the fuck was that?
[362:08.04]I gotta run, I gotta run!
[362:15.06]Jeez, he's fucking fast.
[362:17.62]He's got me.
[362:18.50]No he doesn't.
[362:18.88]Oh, what a waste of time.
[362:31.76]That was a monumental waste of my time.
[362:35.88]I'm glad I did that.
[362:37.06]I got two rusted coins and a shield I'm not going to use.
[362:54.80]Well... Okay.
[362:56.66]Okay.
[363:02.37]I'm gonna walk through the door.
[363:03.49]I'm gonna die to the boss.
[363:07.71]Put it back in the holster.
[363:12.64]Okay, boss.
[363:15.98]I'm gonna lose 24,000 souls.
[363:19.00]But I'm too tired to care about it.
[363:20.82]I don't want to run back here again.
[363:21.88]Who is the boss?
[363:25.29]It's the giant.
[363:26.03]It's the giant guy.
[363:56.72]You guys like singing in the chat?
[363:59.32]Need one more chunk.
[364:33.13]So, uh, now I'm gonna try and just run and fight him.
[364:42.77]What do I get for the prisoner stuff?
[364:43.99]I'm gonna sneeze.
[364:47.69]Oh!
[364:49.96]I'm sorry, guys.
[364:51.10]I apologize.
[364:51.72]I'm sneezing like a psycho.
[364:55.52]Large temporary boost to standard recovery.
[364:57.38]Jillian's one.
[365:04.71]Lots of armor.
[365:10.50]I'm going to buy a bunch of these.
[365:15.70]Some more gold pine resin.
[365:22.26]I can have five of those.
[365:25.57]Five out of five.
[365:28.81]Give me a couple more of these.
[365:31.31]Okay.
[365:35.53]Oh, by the way, guys.
[365:39.77]We're going all night.
[365:45.44]He thought I was... Oh, no, no, no.
[365:48.24]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[365:52.28]We're going all night.
[366:12.19]Come on, don't you know this is a stream where I make a couple of goofs?
[366:20.31]Can I make it?
[366:26.06]I don't know what I did, but I did something.
[366:31.50]Hahaha.
[366:39.50]I actually think I can go up there, and there's probably something up there.
[366:43.13]I just kind of didn't do the jump.
[366:45.71]I just was making it funny.
[366:48.27]I'm going to do that again.
[366:48.93]Except I'm going to land on the top.
[366:59.38]Where's the top?
[367:01.48]Right there.
[367:08.99]You should be in the mid-air, really.
[367:10.19]I knew there was something up here.
[367:14.23]Great bow.
[367:16.85]That's cool.
[367:20.95]Seriously, who is shooting the fireball?
[367:24.00]It's coming out of the fucking can.
[367:25.60]I play games good.
[367:35.56]Thanks for subbing.
[367:36.10]I play games good.
[367:36.84]I think that is the way to get down here.
[367:38.35]But just to dodge the stupid fire can.
[367:43.65]I play games good.
[367:44.55]Welcome.
[367:44.87]Thanks a lot, dude.
[367:46.29]Much appreciated.
[367:54.08]Now let's go just see what the giant does.
[367:56.36]Let's actually see what happens when you fight the giant.
[368:00.60]You're the giant.
[368:05.47]Might as well just get to full health.
[368:06.77]I'm going to sneeze again.
[368:08.03]That's a big sword.
[368:15.11]He had a lot of health.
[368:28.62]My goodness.
[368:31.10]I'm going to go over here because there's an item right here.
[368:35.03]Does it get mad if I sit on the storm ruler?
[368:41.53]Oh, shit.
[368:43.11]Still alive, I guess.
[368:48.96]I thought I double tapped it.
[368:49.86]Apparently not.
[369:00.54]Get away from the throne.
[369:11.95]Am I crazy, or... Oh, I'm looking at his health.
[369:14.03]I don't seem to be doing much to him.
[369:28.42]I really hate the fact that I'm not locking on.
[369:31.20]The lock-on's disappearing.
[369:32.24]Did he have a face?
[369:39.06]Did he, like, eventually land?
[369:43.50]He'll, like, belly flop on me.
[369:44.72]Do something so I can hit you in the face.
[369:52.82]Or in the arms.
[369:56.42]Alright, it's arms.
[369:57.26]It's the arms and the hands, I see.
[369:59.38]I'm seeing.
[370:03.55]Seems a little odd how you get him in the hands, though.
[370:12.21]Staying on the right side.
[370:13.17]I don't know.
[370:26.01]Uh... I should put on, like, bulk paper or something.
[370:45.27]It seemed to do more damage when I hit him there.
[370:48.41]Just curious as to the reliable way to keep doing that.
[371:02.43]Gold pine, I'll try it.
[371:07.55]But I guess we have to shoot him right in his hands.
[371:24.79]Don't get shot.
[371:27.00]I say that right when I turn to try to dodge in.
[371:29.04]I get hit still.
[371:36.56]That is so fast.
[371:39.64]That fire shoots crazy fast.
[372:01.32]Let's try gold pine.
[372:05.93]Might work.
[372:10.09]You guys talking about your blood types?
[372:23.35]Let's see if you don't like lightning.
[372:25.00]Kind of.
[372:59.27]I'm trying to figure out the opportunity I'm going to have.
[373:30.58]That's the opportunity right there, I think.
[374:19.62]I screamed at you.
[374:20.80]Slowly but surely, but I'm definitely not doing a strike.
[374:39.78]I am positive of that one.
[374:50.41]I'm gonna go piss on his throne.
[374:51.59]Oh, I didn't.
[374:53.39]I guess I was sprinting.
[374:55.25]I'm getting some distance.
[374:57.69]No, I'm not gonna get distance.
[374:59.67]Alright.
[375:11.02]Touch his throne.
[375:12.80]Make him, like, break his throne.
[375:14.16]It'll enrage him.
[375:26.35]He just sprints after you.
[375:34.56]Eventually, you'll do enough damage to his core.
[375:58.16]I really do feel like you gotta hit him in the hands, but where does the opportunity present itself if you didn't do it?
[376:03.64]I feel like when I was hitting him, it was doing more damage in the hands, but like, who kind of cares?
[376:08.46]Or maybe you just have to slowly kill this guy.
[376:20.06]He just has a hundred thousand health.
[376:24.96]I wish I could get him to a threshold.
[376:36.21]Get my zero souls.
[376:50.43]Take a look at some things after this.
[376:51.75]Yeah, I think I'm just going to let him... No, yeah, I'm just going to let him kill me.
[377:01.55]Oh...
[377:12.76]I have gold pine on.
[377:18.10]I didn't even look at the shield I picked up from the stupid chest.
[377:31.29]It's kind of cool looking, I guess.
[377:35.55]Where's the bow?
[377:41.72]I might hold on to this.
[377:42.42]This thing seems pretty cool.
[377:44.72]And I am Dex.
[377:46.82]And here's the sword I got from the giant dude.
[378:00.25]Huh?
[378:01.19]It's broken.
[378:04.33]Skills to assume stance to imbue sword with store are most effective when facing giants.
[378:38.59]There's no attribute requirements for this.
[378:51.34]And he was embered, too.
[378:53.10]Maybe I have to be embered.
[378:55.62]Do I have to kill this guy with his own sword?
[378:57.84]Yeah.
[378:59.20]Yeah, I see.
[379:00.37]I see.
[379:03.19]I'm learning.
[379:18.19]I'm rolling hard.
[379:21.04]Let me get to a safe spot because I'm fat.
[379:22.62]Fuck.
[379:27.06]I'm literally fat rolling right now.
[379:32.16]Where the fuck did it go?
[379:32.94]Where is it?
[379:36.84]Still fat rolling?
[379:39.89]Shit.
[379:42.87]And I just took the fucking ember too.
[379:44.53]I'm like actually pissed off right now.
[379:48.11]I'm for real angry.
[379:49.25]Okay, does he hit the wall here?
[380:05.68]He's not gonna... Don't... Big boy, don't fall down here.
[380:09.59]Is he gonna?
[380:10.09]Please don't.
[380:19.84]This thing's so heavy.
[380:20.68]33, go down to this.
[380:28.86]Okay, I'm good.
[381:01.62]Trying to avoid that and go down this.
[381:09.39]You couldn't have made a more fucking obnoxious thing to have be right there.
[381:14.43]I can't think of something stupider and more aggravating than that.
[381:17.55]What's in the middle of shooting the fire.
[381:22.37]Can I blow that out?
[381:23.31]Alright, don't be mad.
[381:26.51]I gotta like calm down.
[381:27.79]I'm about to go fight the boss with his own weapon.
[381:31.58]I have to hit him with the left trigger.
[381:34.82]I have to hit him with this.
[381:39.40]I'm going to run out of flower power, aren't I?
[381:41.46]Yeah, I guess I should do that.
[381:44.76]Let's see what happens.
[381:49.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[381:50.48]What?
[381:57.11]That's a 39 damage to him.
[382:29.22]Okay.
[382:37.65]So... Uh... Can't say I'm noticing much of a difference.
[383:05.34]If I just stand there and stare at him and hit the button, is he going to be intimidated by me?
[383:22.31]Do I have to repair this?
[383:23.53]Do I have to bring this to what's-his-name and get it repaired?
[383:28.68]I get maybe it said it was like broken, right?
[383:30.61]I don't know.
[383:34.45]Try that.
[383:34.95]Maybe Hagrid will be like, oh, that's the storm sword.
[383:40.01]I know that.
[383:41.13]Blade.
[383:41.55]I have a feeling that's... I don't want to fight like the puzzle boss.
[384:03.43]Ah, you got me.
[384:11.07]Okay, what if I go break the throne?
[384:15.74]Can I break the throne or something?
[384:18.40]There we go.
[384:18.80]I'm going to smash the Iron Throne with the Stormhammer.
[384:23.30]Oh, you broke the spell!
[384:29.04]Okay...
[384:47.33]Just kill me.
[384:56.18]I mean, this is the ability, isn't it?
[384:58.38]Is it not?
[384:59.76]That's what I was doing.
[385:00.56]I didn't really do anything to him.
[385:04.28]Look at my mana bar.
[385:05.06]It's gone.
[385:05.72]I was doing left trigger and swinging into him.
[385:08.98]I wasn't doing anything to him.
[385:15.92]Like, this is the ability, right?
[385:21.80]Do I really have to hold it that long?
[385:27.35]God.
[385:28.07]Okay.
[385:31.31]And it just stays like that.
[385:32.57]Well, I thought it was you just, like, charge it up and swing.
[385:47.74]It was not a very clear indicator that you had to wait for it to become like a Legend of Zelda sword before you use it.
[385:58.87]Is it gonna stay like this?
[386:01.95]How long does that last?
[386:24.71]Good, I solved the puzzle boss.
[386:35.08]This thing is loud.
[386:35.98]It's a very loud sword.
[386:44.87]You see who just walked in?
[386:46.19]The guy with your sacred blade.
[387:21.43]Mm-hmm.
[387:30.64]This is 5,000 fucking damage to this guy.
[387:34.32]Holy shit.
[387:39.05]Alright.
[387:49.59]Now I understand.
[387:51.01]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[387:52.51]It's gonna be hard to charge that up again.
[388:14.32]he's on fire alright
[388:51.52]Yep, I got greedy.
[388:56.38]I think I'm okay.
[388:58.91]No, not okay.
[389:11.48]Yay!
[389:19.17]I solved the puzzle, boss.
[389:26.69]Am I almost at the end of the game?
[389:41.74]I love how you don't play music so I can play my own terrible music.
[389:47.52]Don't, it's not terrible.
[389:54.72]Yeah, that's gonna wrap it up, guys.
[389:58.84]I got a feeling I'm pretty close to the end of the game.
[390:01.79]So, maybe tomorrow we'll finish it up.
[390:05.37]I think there's can't be much more considering there was just a cutscene telling me that, where am I?
[390:17.88]Basin of Vows.
[390:18.60]So I have a question.
[390:20.08]How much damage does this do to a regular enemy?
[391:00.05]I went to look at the statue.
[391:08.45]What's going on?
[391:10.55]Why is this closing?
[391:13.51]I just wanted to look at the statue.
[391:20.37]I wanted to see what the statue was.
[391:21.95]And now there's another boss.
[391:26.38]Are you serious?
[391:29.30]No, I'm boning the fuck out of here.
[391:31.22]You're going to give me a boss right after a boss just because I wanted to look at a statue?
[391:37.15]I have 40,000 souls.
[391:39.79]I'm boning out.
[391:54.34]That's the fastest I've ever gone through a menu in my entire life.
[391:59.49]That's the fastest you've ever seen me go through a menu and get it.
[392:02.35]Let's see what the... I'm gonna get this off.
[392:32.29]So is this going to be just like Dark Souls 2?
[392:35.15]Where they just like throw four bosses at you at the very last second of the game when the game's over?
[392:41.62]I hope not.
[392:42.08]This is the huge axe.
[392:47.52]Or a huge shield.
[392:48.32]That might be cool to play with a strength build.
[392:55.13]But... No.
[392:57.17]Although I can put somebody else's...
[393:01.88]grave to rest.
[393:06.00]There is Yhorm.
[393:12.34]Mr. Crunchman.
[393:21.35]Thank you.
[393:24.03]Mr. Crunchman, this is going to be for you.
[393:27.03]Hold on.
[393:27.71]This is for you in a second.
[393:33.28]Let me level up.
[393:39.88]You got a great name, by the way.
[393:50.85]It's Crunchman, this is for you.
[393:53.09]I was told to destroy someone.
[393:55.80]So... I'm... I was told to destroy a person.
[394:09.32]Where is that?
[394:09.88]It was, like, over here, right?
[394:27.16]I actually don't even have any idea where it was.
[394:33.16]That's, like, the lady.
[394:35.70]She's in the thing.
[394:42.44]What the hell?
[394:43.16]Where was it?
[394:44.82]I remember it.
[394:45.52]It was like back here.
[394:48.67]Somebody tell me.
[394:50.01]Somebody tell me.
[394:50.49]What bonfire was that lady sitting in?
[394:52.39]It was like somewhere down here.
[394:54.05]Which one?
[394:55.03]I don't... I forget which one it is.
[394:58.80]I was told to destroy someone.
[394:59.86]I have to.
[395:00.24]I have to give it one attempt.
[395:10.95]Mr. Crunchman, this is for you.
[395:12.97]This is the one attempt I'm going to give it.
[395:14.34]Alright, where is she?
[395:30.85]Not this way.
[395:38.33]I want to get off Mr. Jeremiah's wild ride.
[395:42.73]straight ahead here we go one attempt for Mr. crunch man this one's for you dude I'm gonna one one attempt to beat this boss
[396:38.90]Come on!
[398:44.86]Oh, I can't use it here!
[398:52.29]The drunk dwarf.
[398:59.35]You know, when you make a promise like that, you fucking do it first try.
[399:02.37]When you tell somebody you're gonna do something, I did it.
[399:09.78]You know, when you fucking end it, that's how you go out.
[399:14.67]You first try the fucking boss.
[399:24.02]I really did think I was gonna do that.
[399:31.76]Alright.
[399:33.00]Listen to me, son!
[399:34.60]I'm your dad!
[399:37.02]DESTROY HIM!
[399:42.38]Peppacy.
[399:43.54]Peppacy, you're too late.
[399:44.99]I already did it.
[399:46.21]There's no one else to destroy.
[399:47.47]At least in my immediate vicinity.
[399:50.57]Yay.
[399:56.88]Yay.
[399:58.34]I have to destroy?
[399:58.96]Well, there's no one to destroy.
[400:01.14]He was talking about that guy.
[400:03.46]I have so many souls.
[400:08.20]No, no, no, no.
[400:09.09]Not to... I'm going... That...
[400:11.88]I'm ending this dream.
[400:15.98]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[400:26.19]I don't know why that was so perfect, but it was.
[400:43.31]Oh, what can I get with that boss soul?
[400:51.49]Soothing sunlight is a miracle ore.
[400:55.77]Dancer's curved swords.
[401:00.72]These are interesting.
[401:05.06]Scales with everything.
[401:15.36]Dancer's Grace.
[401:19.62]That's cool.
[401:20.48]I... These are really cool.
[401:27.75]The reason why these are so awesome is because... I mean, obviously, you get these pretty late in the game, but... You can build a perfectly rounded character, and it scales with almost every single major stat.
[401:40.37]That's cool.
[401:47.03]Unfortunately, not cool enough for me to want to use because, you know, we've already talked about it.
[401:56.36]So we're just smashing it.
[402:15.48]Alright, guys.
[402:17.14]You can see what I put my points into, and then I'm going to call it a night.
[402:22.62]Two points.
[402:23.24]I'm going to round out strength, and then get another point in endurance. ...
[402:42.57]Let me just make sure of the knots I can do here before I... ...goo.
[402:50.89]Still need one more chunk.
[402:55.99]This is twinkling Titanite.
[402:59.67]Should I just upgrade the hell out of this bow?
[403:01.73]What am I going to use twinkling Titanite for, ever?
[403:03.61]For any reason?
[403:07.69]Try to be careful.
[403:08.95]I don't want...
[403:12.39]I'll stay with the 26,000.
[403:13.17]I'll have to just... Maybe I'll kill, like, one enemy or something before we start tomorrow.
[403:20.99]Let's level up one more time.
[403:22.03]But that is going to be it, guys.
[403:26.17]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[403:28.29]Sorry about the whole subscription thing earlier this evening.
[403:30.76]I think it might even still be happening.
[403:32.14]I don't know.
[403:33.24]If you subbed or if you resubbed, thanks a lot.
[403:36.38]I'm sorry they weren't popping up.
[403:37.92]Twitch was doing some stuff, maybe.
[403:40.71]But yeah, I may or may not be back tomorrow.
[403:43.19]Although I do need to work on a video.
[403:44.47]But I said that for the last three days in a row.
[403:46.83]So I probably will just be back tomorrow.
[403:50.09]And yeah.
[403:51.87]Have a good rest of your night.
[403:52.76]Have a good sleep, guys.
[403:54.18]Thanks again for coming out.
[403:55.58]Much love.
[403:57.04]Much love.
[403:58.82]And good night.
[403:59.72]Goodbye.
