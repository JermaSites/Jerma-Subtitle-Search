[ve:60.16.100]

[01:38.48]Thank you.
[03:05.20]Thank you.
[04:04.28]Thank you.
[08:32.11]Hey!
[08:32.75]How's it going?
[08:35.01]Hopefully my mic settings aren't wrong.
[08:36.85]Remember, everyone, today, more than anything, this is something new.
[08:43.22]Entirely new.
[08:43.94]It's existed for less than a few hours.
[08:45.82]YouTube Gaming's been out for, like, I don't know, two hours?
[08:49.50]Three hours?
[08:50.34]I've never done it before.
[08:51.64]I've never streamed before, ever.
[08:53.00]My long-time Twitch audience will know that I've never streamed before.
[08:56.40]So... We're gonna see how this goes.
[09:00.62]We're gonna see how...
[09:02.34]Everything works the chats probably gonna be awful like YouTube comment section was awful for the first two weeks that it existed and to start off I
[09:11.33]It's telling me that I have to go to the Manco store because I don't have any hats.
[09:14.34]I don't have it.
[09:15.28]This is a new account.
[09:16.22]We're going to do some contracts first.
[09:17.72]On the other account, I do have the 100 cases.
[09:21.10]But we're just, we're going to play the game first.
[09:23.97]Playing the game is important to me.
[09:26.05]It's a prerequisite.
[09:28.51]That's a difficult word.
[09:30.61]I don't know how anyone has ever said it before.
[09:32.30]Who made that word?
[09:34.82]And then, um, we're gonna play the game.
[09:37.17]The HUD is BudHUD.
[09:38.63]Whoa, show information about the HUD.
[09:40.11]I didn't even, that's a thing.
[09:41.05]Alright, there you go.
[09:42.47]There's the information about the HUD.
[09:43.69]Get rekt, everyone.
[09:44.67]Pause that shit.
[09:45.45]Rewind it, because you can actually rewind on YouTube and go back and watch anything, which is weird, because who knows if someone chatting in real time is watching 10 minutes behind.
[09:54.82]I don't know.
[09:56.58]But if you just hold on a second there, we're gonna...
[10:01.29]Join a server.
[10:02.73]And actually, shit, the one thing I forgot to do.
[10:05.36]I knew I was forgetting something.
[10:06.98]I was sitting here like, dude, I'm so smart, I haven't forgotten anything.
[10:12.26]The most important thing.
[10:15.60]The gunmetal pass.
[10:18.64]I forgot to buy one of those.
[10:19.82]I don't even have, like, funds on this account.
[10:22.88]I don't have adding funds set up on this account.
[10:25.52]So, you know, totally need, like, another...
[10:30.57]30 seconds.
[10:31.03]I know everyone's going to leave and get bored in 30 seconds.
[10:36.13]Put in your PayPal info.
[10:40.47]Peter, why don't you save that?
[10:42.15]Why doesn't it save that, man?
[10:47.61]I sat here and tried to make sure every possible thing that could go wrong wouldn't go wrong.
[10:51.79]Because usually a lot of things go wrong.
[10:57.44]We're also streaming only 720p today, not 60 FPS either.
[11:02.18]I kind of wanted to start off... Not entirely sure how much my computer can handle from this, because twitch.tv only allows you to up to 3,500 kilobytes a second.
[11:15.87]Right now we're at 5,000 something something.
[11:19.03]And I seem to be doing that just fine, but I didn't want to... Like, TF2 is a hard enough game to stream as it is.
[11:25.75]But I didn't wanna do nothing weird.
[11:30.61]Dude, I'm premium!
[11:33.70]So yeah, this is an absolutely brand new account, not a single achievement.
[11:39.00]Nothing.
[11:39.84]We just got, oh, one item in inventory.
[11:42.16]Pyro, all you guys got one item in inventory.
[11:44.60]That's awesome.
[11:45.20]Let's activate our gunmetal pass.
[11:48.57]Get some contracts, dudes, and play the game, then open up 100 cases, and hopefully get premium on another account.
[11:56.66]What it actually tells you, campaign kills?
[11:59.60]I didn't know that.
[12:00.18]I guess I haven't looked at my coin in a very long time.
[12:07.56]Who referred me to TF2?
[12:10.04]Don't have a friends list.
[12:17.44]How's your chat experience, everyone?
[12:19.37]Is it terrible?
[12:20.13]I hope it's terrible.
[12:21.23]I hope you guys aren't having any fun.
[12:23.59]Uh, so gotta play heavy.
[12:26.29]Heavy contract is... is ass when no one heals you, but okay.
[12:34.93]Very much contract.
[12:37.31]Score points on Borneo.
[12:38.63]Wonder where we're gonna go.
[12:39.51]We're gonna go play heavy on Borneo for the big TF2 stream I plan today.
[12:44.09]Wow, sounds fun to play heavy.
[12:46.41]After we finish probably these first set, depending if it gives me ones immediately, we're gonna open the cases, which is kind of the only thing anyone in the world cares about.
[12:54.92]So, hold on.
[12:57.90]Joining a server.
[13:02.40]Yeah, I'm really, really hoping that there's some more moderation with YouTube chat in the future.
[13:08.00]I don't like the icons next to people's names.
[13:10.70]You can't pop out the chat, so it's very difficult for me to even have it open the way I normally would and be reading it.
[13:18.90]And... I don't know.
[13:20.86]I really do just look back to when YouTube updated their comment system and it took them about a month to be like, Oh shit, we don't want people to post screamers every couple of seconds.
[13:29.66]And Bob's army is annoying.
[13:31.21]I didn't know that.
[13:34.99]Dude has seven seconds on Scout.
[13:36.65]You missed it.
[13:38.49]Showed that for less than seven seconds.
[13:48.88]Reels, though.
[13:49.50]I hope my game isn't crashing.
[13:53.62]You know how TF2 always tries to crash when it joins a server?
[13:57.08]It doesn't understand.
[13:58.00]It doesn't know what's happening.
[14:03.72]Yeah, there's very little that can be done about chat.
[14:05.92]I mean, I think it removes some of the basic horrible things that you'd expect to be removed, or want to be removed, rather.
[14:13.21]Like, F yo mama, she's so fat.
[14:17.63]I probably might, I probably would keep that, actually.
[14:19.59]I feel like that's just gonna be all that the chat is.
[14:22.84]It doesn't matter much.
[14:23.56]Do we really have to play heavy?
[14:24.62]Do we have to play no hat, no items?
[14:28.56]I don't even have a sandwich to take a thousand damage in a single life.
[14:32.16]And I'm not renting a sandwich.
[14:34.95]No, let's go get in there and heavy it up.
[14:40.56]Dude thinks he's cool.
[14:41.50]Dude thinks he's got rockets.
[14:42.56]Dude, where are the names?
[14:43.64]Dude, your kill feed's broken.
[14:44.84]What is this HUD?
[14:45.54]This HUD is broken.
[14:46.76]What server are you on, dude?
[14:48.49]There's no names.
[14:50.47]So people don't join me and ruin the experience.
[14:53.73]I'm sure people will be asking that and no one will even know because they can't look in the chat and have a conversation ever.
[15:00.31]But, for future reference.
[15:02.76]Did I already get 10 points?
[15:05.06]Did I do anything?
[15:07.22]I don't feel like I did anything.
[15:08.26]I don't think I want to be able to do the advance to this contract.
[15:11.90]Same with the other one.
[15:12.50]I hate doing, like, win a round on Borneo.
[15:14.10]You have to beat, like, Borneo, like, 18 times.
[15:17.00]Effio Mama, she, well, I mean, you just write Effio Mama.
[15:22.88]I don't think, I mean, don't say swears, guys.
[15:27.56]Come on.
[15:28.14]I mean, this is heavy.
[15:29.38]We know what's up.
[15:31.02]Rev up, walk forward.
[15:31.88]Rev up, walk forward.
[15:35.30]Good crit.
[15:36.44]I got points for that.
[15:37.54]What did I do?
[15:39.08]How did I... Did I get in a... I don't know.
[15:41.60]I don't remember killing anyone.
[15:43.32]I don't want to play heavy.
[15:45.06]This is not how I pictured the stream going.
[15:47.64]Well, let's boot up the stream.
[15:48.64]Let's get some sick frags in Team Fortress 2 on no hat heavy.
[15:54.61]On Borneo.
[15:56.49]So exciting.
[16:01.44]That's, that's the way it is.
[16:02.94]I hope everything's working.
[16:05.17]No one's, oh my god, where are my teammates?
[16:11.07]There's just this one fiery hat loser.
[16:14.85]Firing crit rockets every ten seconds.
[16:16.85]I ain't got nobody else on blue team.
[16:18.17]Where are the blue dudes?
[16:21.27]Blue dudes!
[16:23.47]Hanging out in spawn wearing your I'm free to play hats.
[16:26.89]Jumping on windows.
[16:28.81]Playing TF2.
[16:29.87]This is the experience we want.
[16:31.53]That's why we want people to join.
[16:32.67]Because if people join, they play the game.
[16:34.92]That's unacceptable.
[16:37.36]You have to have the one tryhard on the other team.
[16:40.08]With the crits medic.
[16:41.90]I can't... See where he was going.
[16:45.64]I'm going.
[16:46.16]We're flanking.
[16:46.76]We're flank heavy.
[16:47.54]We're flank fist heavy.
[16:52.00]Never mind.
[16:52.68]There's... I don't want to fucking play heavy.
[16:58.89]Not with like, there's like no medic.
[17:00.37]There's nothing.
[17:01.17]It's not good.
[17:11.16]Games are going fine other than this insane chat.
[17:13.18]I'm sure as well.
[17:15.85]People are going to get over, like, oh, haha, I can write boob, like, that's the thing.
[17:21.47]For, like, right now.
[17:22.21]For, like, a week, people are going to think the boob sign is funny.
[17:25.39]And then everyone's going to be like, come on.
[17:27.11]You're still doing the boob thing, man.
[17:35.25]And everyone's going to... I don't know.
[17:38.17]We'll get bored of it.
[17:40.63]This is so much easier than heavy.
[17:45.38]I'm, like, killing people.
[17:47.34]I'm earning points.
[17:48.79]Points!
[17:49.69]Points on Burnier!
[17:50.89]These are some Burnier points.
[17:53.43]Yeah, see, Boob's funny.
[17:54.69]Ha ha ha ha!
[17:56.29]That's fantastic.
[17:57.03]Like, one guy did it, and that was determined the funny emote.
[18:00.07]That's the thing that people do.
[18:02.39]There's a lot of funny emotes.
[18:03.85]Why'd everyone have to settle on Boob?
[18:06.35]I did that on calculators when I was a ten-year-old.
[18:08.53]Not funny anymore.
[18:10.70]Oh, he's standing two still for me.
[18:14.10]Achievement!
[18:18.01]Oh, I also still have the Jerma sound mod enabled.
[18:22.05]He doesn't say anything about the cart, but... Right, I have it?
[18:25.35]Oh, wait, hold on.
[18:31.32]Yeah, you can hear him laughing.
[18:33.38]Which is weird, because he's on fire.
[18:34.88]That's a weird thing to, like... Still kind of quiet, but yeah.
[18:44.76]Except when he talks about the cart.
[18:46.56]That's the scout.
[18:55.15]That's just- that's just dynamic enough for me to be into it.
[18:58.97]Where- Dude- dude was very- Dude was very unaware until the tryhard gold rocket fire hat pocket medic up his ass showed up.
[19:18.49]I guess we- I guess we have to go back to heavy.
[19:27.27]And my Twitter pooped up.
[19:31.61]No, you haven't met him?
[19:32.47]I don't know.
[19:33.07]Look at that awesome scoreboard that shows all the people.
[19:35.37]Dude, why is your HUD broken?
[19:41.08]So, a lot of people are probably also wondering, like, dude, are you going to do this from now on?
[19:44.40]Are you going to use Twitch?
[19:46.02]What's your story?
[19:48.36]Where are you from?
[19:49.04]Where are you going?
[19:50.86]They're buff bannering.
[19:52.48]They're...
[19:53.83]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[19:55.33]This is the trial run.
[19:56.79]So far, the trial is I expect the chat will be better within a month or two.
[20:01.85]Because it really needs to be.
[20:05.43]Aw, he kept walking at me.
[20:06.94]I'll wait for this health, because it's all I've got.
[20:08.52]I ain't got sandwiches.
[20:10.54]And I gotta take a thousand points of damage.
[20:15.44]That guy's got a medic.
[20:16.30]Dude, I just want to be on the red team.
[20:18.02]You know how easy this game would be if I was on the red team?
[20:24.75]There's boys everywhere, boys.
[20:27.23]I kinda like, I'm just, I kinda wanna go on a different server.
[20:30.73]It's either like a roll blue team, or I don't know, we're gonna figure it out.
[20:37.72]We're gonna become the hero.
[20:43.72]I just have the heavy contract to do.
[20:51.16]Scout was going well, man.
[20:57.59]I should call my crew in.
[21:00.28]In between all the emote spam, I can totally, like, see people actually saying things.
[21:07.28]Part of me is like, oh, hey, I can read that.
[21:10.64]And part of me is like... They don't say anything anyway.
[21:17.55]But yeah, I think in the long run...
[21:22.65]I would like to use this more than I would like to use Twitch.
[21:25.57]Currently, probably not.
[21:27.83]I mean, a lot of my life right now is planned around, very awkwardly, very planned around the fact that Overwatch is going to release.
[21:35.18]So, like, by the time Overwatch beta is out, maybe YouTube will work better and then I could stream Overwatch on YouTube instead of Twitch.
[21:41.26]I don't know.
[21:42.44]We'll have to see what happens.
[21:45.87]Maybe Twitch will actually make a better website.
[21:50.88]That's always possible.
[21:53.91]We've had a couple years to do that, though.
[21:55.55]Man, this sucks.
[22:02.33]There's a sentry up there.
[22:06.59]This medic, we're gonna have to get in there, man.
[22:11.42]Let's go.
[22:11.92]Let's go.
[22:18.89]There we go.
[22:19.45]Spy sapped it.
[22:20.23]Teamwork!
[22:21.62]Makes the dream work.
[22:25.50]Okay, he's gonna try and snipe us, so, um... I'm just going after him, dude.
[22:28.60]You think you can snipe me?
[22:29.36]You can't snipe me.
[22:32.75]I got a shotgun.
[22:33.63]What heavies run around with shotguns?
[22:35.09]I'd have a sandwich if I could.
[22:41.05]There's there's a heavy combo people I got achievement though achievements are cool We almost finished our heavy contract as well, so you're not gonna have to play this class much longer And again once these these two contracts are done I'm gonna start opening up cases.
[22:57.00]We're gonna split it up a bit though I only have 50 keys currently so I'm gonna have to buy the other 50.
[23:01.92]It's more of an inventory management thing I
[23:09.29]I guess we'll open 50 and then do some more contracts and come back later and do the other 50.
[23:13.61]Can I... Can I get this?
[23:28.98]I got this.
[23:30.28]We got Ubers again, dude.
[23:31.60]Someone loves me.
[23:32.87]Someone's like, hey, this dude... This dude can't hit a scout right in front of him.
[23:42.14]Dude, everyone's buffed!
[23:43.18]We lost?!
[23:45.58]The cart is on the point!
[23:47.58]Fuck!
[23:49.94]Come on!
[23:51.41]It looked like we had it and I was shooting guys and they're all concheded.
[23:55.37]The contra, not the Buff Banner.
[23:56.75]I mean, they're all technically banners that provide buffs to allies.
[24:02.11]And it's my objective to capture things as well.
[24:07.22]I kind of want to be on the other team.
[24:10.66]Dude.
[24:13.72]Raise your dongers, really?
[24:14.98]What is this, like, 2013?
[24:16.56]I think it's time to join a different server.
[24:25.47]Just so I can get on blue team and... Listen to your elevator music.
[24:32.65]While I find a different Borneo server.
[24:34.71]We can get these contracts done.
[24:37.67]Nice and skiffy where the duck is Jerma.
[24:39.25]He's a separate person living in a separate city doing his own thing.
[24:44.10]He's just He's just doing his own thing I would be that'd be weird if we were conjoined twins Because then he would be here and then it would be odd that he wasn't talking He would have like some issue with me and he was just being really quiet Isn't there some movie
[25:04.00]I'll conjoin twins and they get in a fight and it's like the dumber and dumber people in the movies even dumber.
[25:08.90]Oh, the music was muted anyway.
[25:11.40]I did the music hotkey, but it was still zero volume.
[25:14.48]I wonder if I just joined the same server again.
[25:22.09]I don't know.
[25:32.45]Who knows?
[25:35.71]I like playing Scout on new accounts just because you don't need any items.
[25:39.53]One reason I thought that Sentry was ours was it was in such a weird place and not even level 3 yet.
[25:50.54]Well, I can't- every time I was gonna click on him, I got air blasted to the side.
[25:55.88]Yeah, Scout- I mean, pistol, scattergun, carries, bat, whatever.
[25:59.51]We're good to go.
[26:00.63]Soldier, you're missing Gunboats.
[26:02.77]That's a double Sentry scenario.
[26:11.86]Okay, screw you, dude.
[26:13.28]I got the Jerma scout asking for doctor and everything.
[26:15.56]Not that you can hear it.
[26:17.08]But I said doctor like an idiot.
[26:19.92]Like a dumb scout.
[26:21.30]Multiple times.
[26:23.66]They're still there.
[26:25.36]Do we have a demoman?
[26:30.00]I don't think we have a demoman.
[26:31.34]I'm gonna have to be... The demoman.
[26:36.19]Demoman's good with stock weapons, too.
[26:37.51]I just hate sticky launcher.
[26:38.61]I never use it.
[26:40.64]Oh, you can't see anything.
[26:41.84]Wow, chat.
[26:42.52]Dude, chat helped.
[26:43.66]Dude, maybe I did that to prove that chat is important.
[26:47.41]And now you guys are gonna, like, learn your lesson.
[26:50.15]And you're gonna be like, dude.
[26:53.79]I can't believe I always do that.
[26:55.07]How do I always do that?
[26:56.77]Now you guys don't even understand.
[26:58.31]We got Demoman all over the place shooting at these double sentries.
[27:01.71]I was just going to take a peek to show you.
[27:03.61]I wanted you to understand that you missed it.
[27:06.35]There's double sentries, there's triple engineer, and there's many Demoman that still can't even do it.
[27:16.75]Listen, guys.
[27:22.47]Listen.
[27:24.57]You don't understand what it's like.
[27:26.43]It's hard in these streets.
[27:27.35]I don't think you could ever understand.
[27:36.62]Our team is getting crushed.
[27:39.60]Maybe this is the same server.
[27:47.62]Stock spy, let's go.
[27:48.64]You're gonna see some sick stair stabs.
[27:52.68]You have to say them with, like, an SH, otherwise they don't count.
[27:57.93]Let me, uh... Give me an Engineer Disguise.
[28:00.77]There's, like, 15 of them.
[28:07.49]He heard it.
[28:08.41]He heard it.
[28:08.83]I'm scared.
[28:15.44]I'm not scared anymore.
[28:16.82]Okay.
[28:18.58]Okay.
[28:20.14]What?
[28:21.02]I don't have the disguises last button on this account for some- Get the f- I'm not looking at the s- Guys, I'm hyper- I'm hyperventilating.
[28:30.81]I don't like th- There's- They're everywhere!
[28:36.11]There's no way this- I'm go- I'm not gonna get a single kill.
[28:41.65]I'm gonna put some of the health.
[28:44.15]Dude, I wanna go- Dude.
[28:45.79]Dude.
[28:46.45]Dude.
[28:46.87]Listen.
[28:47.48]Listen guys, here's the strat.
[28:50.11]We go all the way back.
[28:51.97]We all go to home town.
[28:54.63]Home city.
[28:55.25]Where we're from.
[28:55.83]Born and raised.
[28:56.49]Take the teleporter.
[29:07.92]I told you we wouldn't get one.
[29:08.94]Why is there a sentry up there?
[29:15.78]Why?
[29:16.58]There's already like four in that room.
[29:19.22]We're losing.
[29:19.94]There's 40 seconds left.
[29:22.50]We can't break this sentry barrier?
[29:24.33]I should have been Dome Man from the start.
[29:32.64]Wasted all that time.
[29:45.39]Can we get this?
[29:46.41]No, dude's gonna snipe me because there's nobody else here to help.
[29:57.10]No, I'm pushing this cart.
[29:58.80]You can't stop me!
[30:00.86]You ain't stopping this!
[30:02.28]I have a sticky launcher.
[30:08.03]That was awful.
[30:09.91]This stream just feels like...
[30:14.87]This stream feels like a disaster.
[30:18.24]Totally, totally... Dude, if I was doing that from the beginning, though... Just before you know it, 40 seconds left.
[30:27.86]And I gotta be on the blue team.
[30:33.37]I gotta be a blue guy so I can cap points and finish up this contract.
[30:36.33]Come on, man.
[30:43.63]Come on.
[30:47.84]This is the part where I read chat.
[30:53.46]Boo.
[30:53.80]Good job.
[30:54.30]Loot get.
[30:54.88]Loot get.
[30:55.36]Loot get.
[30:55.86]Kill feed.
[30:56.72]Loot get.
[30:57.54]Why kill feed?
[30:58.69]Face.
[30:59.09]Face.
[30:59.47]Boob.
[31:01.51]A meme.
[31:02.07]There's a meme.
[31:03.13]There's another boo.
[31:08.13]A couple of emotes.
[31:09.75]Guys are going hard.
[31:12.95]Way into it.
[31:25.69]Thanks everyone for showing up, though.
[31:29.60]If you enjoy this, I mean, do this.
[31:33.50]Obviously more people here than usual because it's on YouTube, and maybe you're interested about YouTube gaming yourself, but I mean, I stream on the Twitch.
[31:40.52]I stream TF2 on the Twitchers.
[31:44.10]I don't know if I'm gonna stream here permanently, or... There's so many snipers.
[31:48.48]I'm going in.
[31:49.30]I'm gonna get sentry killed.
[31:53.60]Nope.
[31:54.42]The exact opposite.
[31:56.68]I'm gonna get sentry... stopper.
[31:59.74]I'm gonna stop the sentries.
[32:01.22]Okay, try and come that way.
[32:10.34]Oh.
[32:11.92]Dude, he has a weapon.
[32:12.84]I wonder how I should take his weapon.
[32:13.98]I shouldn't take his weapon.
[32:15.34]It's so fun playing a free-to-play account, like, just starting off a new one.
[32:19.72]Cuz, like, weapons dropping on the ground is exciting.
[32:28.12]Yeah, you kill me, I kill you.
[32:29.62]You kill me, I kill you.
[32:30.64]Oh, there's another boob.
[32:33.18]Seeing that in the chat.
[32:34.12]Seeing some boxes, some bangs.
[32:35.88]You guys are mixing up the bees.
[32:37.62]You're mixing them there.
[32:39.44]Getting creative.
[32:43.17]Jello people mod?
[32:44.11]Jello people mod actually doesn't work on Valve servers, and you need to be on a Valve server to complete contracts.
[32:50.11]Because, uh, Valve servers are SV pure.
[32:54.26]And that disables most mods.
[32:56.30]Most sound things will still work, though.
[32:58.62]So we still have the, uh...
[33:00.72]Really?!
[33:01.13]I killed him, too!
[33:04.09]You kill me, I kill you!
[33:06.49]Why is this so hard right now?
[33:10.23]Why is this, like, impossible?
[33:11.97]This is Borneo 0.1.
[33:12.69]Can we get some dudes out there?
[33:14.67]Can we get some medics out there?
[33:16.16]Come on, can we bring it to the field?
[33:17.22]Let's pull it together.
[33:18.12]You can fan jump up there.
[33:19.32]I believe in you.
[33:21.50]He has the atomizer as well.
[33:22.86]He can't get up nowhere.
[33:23.88]Here.
[33:24.04]Here.
[33:32.15]You kill me, I kill you.
[33:33.15]Well, I mean the other guy killed you.
[33:34.63]And I got the sentry.
[33:35.93]You might not be able to tell because my kill feed's totally broken and doesn't work.
[33:40.34]That's on purpose.
[33:41.10]We got the sentry.
[33:43.60]Apparently impossible to destroy sentry placements.
[33:56.09]Why me?
[33:56.63]Heavy, turn around.
[33:57.35]Heavy, turn around!
[33:58.11]Heavy, just turn!
[33:59.67]Just turn and look at the dude.
[34:01.11]Someone turn and look at that dude.
[34:05.01]Okay, I'm scouting.
[34:07.07]No, there's still two sentries there.
[34:10.73]It's just never ending.
[34:11.73]Someone else has to shoot them.
[34:21.18]I don't think anyone's gonna.
[34:22.12]I'm gonna lose my mind before I even get one.
[34:31.83]Can't even get close to it because we're just getting thwomped.
[34:38.04]Yep, can't get close.
[34:39.62]Getting thwomped.
[34:41.84]And I'm too bad at Spy to even pretend I'm gonna do that again.
[34:44.78]I got a minute.
[35:05.04]Oh my god.
[35:12.10]Sentry down.
[35:12.76]Thank god.
[35:18.97]Can I just, can I just be on like a balanced server?
[35:21.95]I don't have any hats.
[35:27.25]What do you expect me to do in this situation?
[35:42.59]Get him in there.
[35:49.27]We have a medic.
[35:49.87]We got this.
[35:55.01]We got this.
[35:57.65]I gotta say, it feels like my game isn't lagging at all, by the way.
[36:00.15]I totally could have bumped up the quality like another couple of metrics.
[36:10.13]Okay.
[36:11.36]Borneo 0.1 is just way too difficult.
[36:15.18]Hold on, and I'm going to remember to take it off this time, changing servers again.
[36:20.22]That's a cop car outside, man.
[36:25.64]That's a car.
[36:30.50]Perhaps... Actually, it's probably a fire truck.
[36:32.58]There's a fire station pretty close.
[36:34.73]I always hear them.
[36:36.81]I don't even play with view models on.
[36:38.31]I've been doing it for like five years.
[36:39.91]I'm kind of used to it.
[36:56.10]Where I started playing with from the very beginning I'm surprised so many people like the people other people who stream TF2 or do whatever like play without view models.
[37:13.09]It's just If you're if you're playing the game, I understand like I like to play Scout without view models and
[37:21.13]I do.
[37:23.65]But for people watching, like having nothing here, this is awkward.
[37:28.97]A lot of folks don't even understand.
[37:32.19]What weapon do you have, Val?
[37:33.41]What are you doing?
[37:34.01]What weapons are you using?
[37:36.01]Did you switch?
[37:36.95]I don't understand.
[37:38.41]It's too complicated.
[37:39.39]I don't understand 10 deck slots.
[37:41.80]I can't see any of them.
[37:49.44]Chat is the worst, I agree.
[37:52.08]Guy who said that 30 seconds ago and got pushed off the screen.
[38:01.24]Someone asked, there's people asking questions, I can't read them fast enough.
[38:10.40]The thing with Twitch, too, is Twitch has the chat API out so people can make things like Nightbot that just automatically time stuff out.
[38:19.76]And there's some sort of automated server moderation there.
[38:23.44]This doesn't have none of that.
[38:27.92]I would love to have a Chargin' Targe.
[38:40.01]That didn't hit him?
[38:47.24]Come over here.
[38:49.72]You're getting away?
[38:50.40]I'll take that 300.
[38:51.20]Oh, does red team have like the pocket medic tryhard people?
[38:57.55]Again?
[38:58.25]Again?
[38:58.63]How much you want to bet there's a thingy right there?
[39:06.71]That didn't hit him?
[39:12.43]Heavy, turn around.
[39:13.31]It's like we're playing the same thing forever.
[39:15.43]We're in the Twilight Zone.
[39:16.75]Nothing changes.
[39:20.29]You know what?
[39:20.97]I'm going behind.
[39:21.65]Because if there's a sentry here, he doesn't think someone's going to show up and shoot it.
[39:33.10]See?
[39:33.40]Told you.
[39:39.78]Where's that exit?
[39:43.69]I have to go get health and shit.
[39:46.61]I have to- aw, why are you here?
[39:51.97]Why would anyone be there?
[39:56.21]Why are there multiple people in there?
[40:01.71]Okay.
[40:02.39]We're in dangerous territory.
[40:05.75]But so far we've given everybody the dipsy-doo.
[40:07.69]We're gonna stand here and reload for one second.
[40:15.91]He doesn't even know.
[40:16.73]He doesn't even know his sentry is about to get bomb blasted.
[40:28.00]Got him!
[40:32.36]They're everywhere!
[40:33.34]What am I getting shot by?
[40:35.38]That took so long to do.
[40:36.68]Okay, we gotta go get that other one because it's probably still there.
[40:39.74]We're just on sentry duty today.
[40:42.72]No, we got it.
[40:44.20]We're making progress.
[40:49.77]I don't know what he was trying to do.
[40:50.71]He was trying to, like, sentry jump up into the skybox.
[40:53.03]There's probably some glitch there.
[40:54.25]Dude, glitch abuser.
[40:55.31]Exploiter.
[40:55.95]Ban him.
[41:04.93]Okay, dude.
[41:05.61]We got this.
[41:06.35]It's a roll from here.
[41:08.45]It's easy.
[41:11.35]I gotta get this cap, though.
[41:16.94]Okay, it was worth dying for.
[41:18.84]Need those points.
[41:29.47]Okay.
[41:32.76]I'm cool with that.
[41:33.84]I probably should have waited for someone to use it.
[41:39.37]Dude, light him on fire.
[41:40.41]Dude, I'm so into this.
[41:42.71]I actually, guys, I know a lot of people are.
[41:45.16]I've been playing more TF2 lately.
[41:48.27]We're happy about that.
[41:50.99]I haven't played it in a long enough time, and the HUD with no names on it helps me enjoy the game just enough more that it's fun to play every once in a while again.
[41:59.61]And just in general, I've wanted to start playing more FPS games so that when matchmaking comes out, I'm not like... the worst player in the world.
[42:09.96]I could be close to the worst player, but if you're the absolute worst...
[42:14.71]Ben, Ben you don't have much going for you.
[42:16.69]Did I bump a spy or a wall?
[42:19.34]Are you a spy or are you just trying to get up to a sick sniper spot?
[42:27.28]Same thing, Overwatch is a relatively soon thing.
[42:31.61]Who's, oh he's behind me.
[42:43.37]Almost done with these contracts.
[42:44.37]Again, once we're done with this one, we're gonna open 50 cases, which should be way more exciting than me losing on Borneo.
[43:03.26]Venture down.
[43:04.10]Whiskey Tango Bravo.
[43:06.26]Maybe if we finish this contract early, I'd try at least finish this round.
[43:18.40]Where is this guy going?
[43:21.04]Why do you still have health?
[43:27.35]This guy, he's too good at Pyro.
[43:29.19]He's unstoppable.
[43:33.63]Star answered this.
[43:34.63]Dude, I saw a comment, was able to read it, and answered it.
[43:38.15]I wish I could read.
[43:38.97]Like, so much of me streaming is...
[43:42.47]Personally, I just like to read things.
[43:43.99]It gives me something to talk about.
[43:45.12]I never know what to talk about on my own.
[43:46.90]Everything seems obvious to me.
[43:48.22]When someone asks a question, I'm like, dude, that wasn't obvious.
[43:51.90]Don't you know?
[43:52.48]Haven't you been watching me for like five years?
[43:55.16]Don't you know the answer to everything about my life?
[43:56.98]Haven't you been stalking me?
[43:58.18]Because I know everything.
[44:01.47]I feel like that's a quality that I possess, knowing everything.
[44:06.81]About myself, at least.
[44:10.37]Or a decent amount, you know.
[44:14.20]I don't know what my cholesterol is at right now.
[44:20.10]Did get wrecked.
[44:20.82]Give me this.
[44:22.80]Can't put that down, but I'm okay with it.
[44:24.40]Because we're about to go crazy.
[44:32.75]I guess jumping in a hole is going crazy.
[44:37.19]Alright.
[44:38.61]Let's go open some cases and see what we got from these.
[44:40.83]And we're going to do some more contracts.
[44:42.55]Open another 50 after that.
[44:50.08]Giveaways giveaways always suck you'll test it dirt gun Wayne's and dirt guns And a well-worn well-worn shit gurn I
[45:12.61]Fascinating stuff, everyone.
[45:13.73]It was well worth the, what, $6?
[45:15.11]Let's get that contract.
[45:17.11]I like just doing the contracts.
[45:18.55]I don't care what I get out of them.
[45:19.99]The fun part for me has always been just doing them.
[45:25.24]Wait one minute while I change accounts and actually get to the account that has the cases on it.
[45:35.35]My game would actually close.
[45:37.47]There we go.
[45:43.29]Yeah, hope you guys are ready to loot get.
[45:45.21]You know, I say I'm unlucky with opening cases, and I hate to be the guy who's like, oh, never lucky, I never get anything.
[45:52.96]But I think throughout the course, the history, the existence of the game, Team Fortress 2, I have opened about, probably more than 400 crates.
[46:05.42]I have unboxed, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I only remember ever unboxing one unusual.
[46:10.97]It was the Orbiting Fireball Stout Shaco.
[46:15.35]I feel like the odds aren't in my favor in this kind of shit.
[46:22.25]How many accounts do I have?
[46:23.41]Since Contracts came out, I think I have like five or six now.
[46:26.41]I don't even know.
[46:30.13]I just get to do Contracts forever.
[46:35.70]Why not?
[46:38.58]Okay.
[46:42.33]No more music.
[46:43.11]We got... These are the cases we've got.
[46:44.83]We don't have an even distribution of powerhouse and concealed.
[46:49.63]I mean, it's what I got.
[46:51.15]And then the next page is random stuff.
[46:54.39]So that's why I only got one page of keys.
[46:56.35]And we're going to split it up, and I'll do it later.
[46:58.30]We'll figure it out.
[46:59.02]I'll do more contracts after this, because you kind of have to log in and out of accounts before you can do that.
[47:04.28]Dude, here's the first crate unboxing.
[47:06.48]What is it?
[47:07.88]What's inside the free Manco store?
[47:10.24]Untradeable, uncraftable garbage.
[47:12.98]Oh, it's a bizarre bargain.
[47:14.66]I can't do anything with this.
[47:16.32]I can't trade it.
[47:18.62]Is it actually craftable now?
[47:19.86]I don't know.
[47:21.98]No one cares.
[47:23.40]That's awesome.
[47:24.58]It's opening things, right?
[47:27.44]Well, I suppose I'm just gonna... I'm gonna get into it.
[47:31.63]We're gonna open this first page.
[47:34.51]And gootlet.
[47:36.55]Loot get.
[47:38.87]That's a really good start!
[47:41.27]That's a really good start!
[47:44.06]Factory new, with the stat track on it.
[47:46.16]That's, um...
[47:49.59]That might be the best thing we get.
[47:52.60]There's a decent possibility that that is the best thing that we open today.
[47:56.84]I'm not sure, though.
[48:02.14]I would love, after a hundred cases, to actually get something I'd want to use.
[48:06.00]Like, that's what you'd expect normally.
[48:09.41]It's garbage.
[48:12.83]In fact...
[48:14.83]Let's save some inventory space and declare that completely worthless.
[48:23.42]Dude, that's an item!
[48:25.20]Well, that's an item.
[48:26.68]Dude, that's an item!
[48:28.66]Nice!
[48:29.84]What are we gonna get, an item?
[48:32.28]That's an item.
[48:38.16]Crack those stats, man.
[48:39.28]We got another one.
[48:39.88]We got a dirtier one.
[48:41.00]It's got blood all in the back.
[48:44.08]I kind of like the way that one looks as banged up even more.
[48:47.36]Because it's like Rambo used it.
[48:48.99]It was efficient.
[48:49.77]It was a good weapon.
[48:50.77]And now you have it.
[48:52.31]Rather than like this came out of the pristine perfect.
[48:59.43]And like someone just made this.
[49:01.10]Why would you just make a camo minigun?
[49:03.82]Why are those still in production that there's new ones?
[49:07.08]That was our first SMG of many.
[49:16.75]That's an item!
[49:18.09]Actually, I don't even think I've seen that one.
[49:20.09]That's like... Disgusting.
[49:22.65]That one's really... Hold on, hold on.
[49:31.27]I haven't really opened too many of these.
[49:33.27]I mean, I've gotten my fair share of revolvers as well, but that one's like...
[49:38.05]70s flower montage.
[49:40.43]Collage, even.
[49:41.41]I just want to go on a map and inspect it real quick.
[49:53.76]It's there.
[49:54.64]Yep, we're going.
[49:57.06]Got it.
[50:00.78]The spy guy.
[50:01.40]I want to see this.
[50:05.42]It's a purple one.
[50:06.52]You think I have this purple frickin' Bat 70 Shogun?
[50:10.90]No, I didn't.
[50:13.54]That's just, what, who made that?
[50:17.53]Who designed that and was like, okay, I just put this color here.
[50:20.85]I'm gonna like Pollock this gun and be famous.
[50:24.29]Everyone's gonna frickin' love me.
[50:26.01]Anyway, moving on with our lives.
[50:27.51]Sorry for the distraction, everyone.
[50:29.25]I know that probably ruined everyone's day that I wasn't opening more cases, delaying the inevitable.
[50:38.64]I was really fascinated by the little fruit and scum.
[50:42.36]And I have a different name for it every time I reference it.
[50:46.56]Inspecting the inventory?
[50:47.58]Oh yeah, you can do that now.
[50:48.58]I actually haven't really done that much.
[50:52.93]That's a new feature.
[50:56.15]There's no bullets in it.
[50:58.83]You're a smart guy.
[50:59.81]And I was able to read the chat.
[51:01.33]Wow.
[51:01.57]You see how that helps?
[51:03.01]Yeah, being able to read the chat helps.
[51:05.71]That's awesome.
[51:09.45]Some SMGs, you know.
[51:13.43]Gonna always be the same one as well.
[51:14.77]I don't know if there's other SMGs inside the concealed case.
[51:19.23]Probably.
[51:21.49]I feel like the- oh!
[51:23.01]That's another- that's another factory new stat track.
[51:27.72]And it's like the same skin, but on... on a shotgun.
[51:31.86]So like, we can deck out our heavy and be like camo boy.
[51:35.50]Gimme the camo guns, I wanna be camo boy.
[51:40.04]That's the one we just got, right?
[51:42.66]Look at me over here, camo boy.
[51:44.67]Oh yeah, check out my new gun.
[51:47.73]So fancy.
[51:53.19]This looks really bright when they're factory new.
[51:57.37]Aren't those things worth, like, money?
[51:59.37]I don't know.
[52:01.53]I don't really follow the market stuff.
[52:04.70]But factory new stat track, I'd have to imagine, is worth quite a bit.
[52:08.20]And those are, uh... Those are relatively high... Much of my doodles.
[52:16.63]High rarities.
[52:21.74]These items look like shit?
[52:24.02]Totally, dude.
[52:26.91]I'm in... I don't... I don't know.
[52:29.52]I think by themselves, some of them kind of look like shit, and I think the standard was set really high by Counter-Strike, where you can look at... Like, they have some really cool guns.
[52:36.30]They have some, like, bright, stupid-looking ones, but... I don't know.
[52:40.16]For the first case series that Valve introduced, it's... it's acceptable to me.
[52:46.05]And TF2 has a much brighter, much more saturated color palette.
[52:50.11]At least we got a factory new SMG.
[52:54.83]that's that's a gun that's a gun if you're loving your only blues over here only blues talk about battle scar night terror dude I think I actually have on this account I currently on my scout can I go scout real quick
[53:21.60]Fair, that's factory new.
[53:22.64]Yeah, I actually unboxed a factory new Night Terror just after doing a contract.
[53:28.63]I guess I have been pretty lucky.
[53:30.81]I don't know.
[53:31.21]I'm not going to feel personally lucky until I actually unbox an unusual.
[53:39.12]So far, how this has been going, I can't really complain.
[53:42.50]I've done so much box opening lately.
[53:45.29]Like with Hearthstone being the new expansion yesterday.
[53:48.75]How many freaking card packs did I open?
[53:50.89]Like 120.
[53:51.71]I have no life.
[53:53.61]All I do is spend money and open things and go, Wow!
[53:56.79]It's Minimal Way!
[53:57.81]That's all I do my whole life.
[53:59.19]Okay.
[54:10.28]gonna start seeing a lot of the same things dude it takes a long time to open cases you know tip of the hats last year what they opened 200 crates and it took like two hours or an hour an hour and something there's another factory new which might mean something to someone who would play pyro and not use the Degreaser I guess that's my only gripe with uh
[54:32.13]the cases currently, is that who gives a shit about miniguns and SMGs?
[54:40.20]Who uses those?
[54:43.18]Isn't there a sniper rifle in here?
[54:44.60]I mean, it would probably take a little bit more work for the team at Valve.
[54:50.02]I know they want to avoid working on TF2 as long as possible.
[54:54.44]But you could have these same skins on multiple items.
[54:57.20]They already have this skin also on this shotgun.
[55:02.10]I don't know how long it'd take you to be like, oh, we could also have that apply to Tommy Slavs and have a little bit of variety.
[55:08.87]Or we can sell more cases over a longer period of time, I suppose.
[55:14.27]SMG factory.
[55:15.27]Like, everything is brand spanking new right out of the case.
[55:18.49]I don't know why you'd take the time to box it up if it wasn't new, though.
[55:22.37]I mean, you're putting, like, old socks in someone's Christmas basket.
[55:25.97]Yeah, so you use baskets for Christmas.
[55:29.07]You hide the eggs everywhere.
[55:36.49]You could use a minigun.
[55:38.65]Dude!
[55:41.99]I'm getting pretty lucky.
[55:43.73]It's got some cool blood on the handle too.
[55:45.57]I wanna toss that onto my Scooty Booty Man.
[55:52.61]Where it is?
[55:53.47]I can't tell, it's like cut off.
[55:58.59]Is that it?
[55:59.60]That cuts off a little bit.
[56:05.70]Got a blood handle, man.
[56:08.48]I'm into it.
[56:09.71]It's actually a scattergun too, meaning I could potentially use this and not feel like I wasted my life on it.
[56:20.39]Yeah.
[56:21.45]That's cool.
[56:22.71]It's not unusual.
[56:30.30]It's just... It's just way over my expectations before I started.
[56:34.98]Yesterday...
[56:37.82]Like three days ago, I hadn't even seen stat track on a weapon Today today in like five or six Just just keep getting them though
[57:02.81]I thought they were rare, are they, am I even lucky or are they not as rare as I thought they were?
[57:07.29]That one's got some blood on it too.
[57:12.91]And it's a shotgun.
[57:14.83]It's not, and I'm okay with it not being factory new.
[57:18.65]Factory new is dumb.
[57:20.51]I think it kicks you out of your inventory when it changes teams.
[57:23.23]I don't know, probably doesn't.
[57:27.09]Inventory's more important than the game anyway.
[57:29.51]Let's get another stat track right now.
[57:38.58]Damn it.
[57:39.26]That would have been perfect.
[57:40.52]You could hear Jerome in the background, the scout mod, saying Merry Christmas, and I was like, this is gonna be something ridiculous.
[57:48.71]Jerma actually unboxed an unusual sniper rifle he said was worth like $150 or something.
[57:54.51]He didn't even open a lot.
[57:56.07]Not from his unboxing video either, where he opened like, I think 25.
[57:59.81]He just like opened one or two.
[58:01.91]Every time I hear that someone opened like two cases, or two, like, oh, like melee a couple times, and I've been like, yeah, I opened one crate, here, I got this unusual.
[58:11.76]You have to commit to crate opening.
[58:14.38]You have to sit here and do this.
[58:15.64]If you just open one and you get one, that's like a smack in the face to losers like me.
[58:23.08]Team colored decorated weapon?
[58:24.70]Is that special?
[58:25.93]I actually haven't seen that before.
[58:28.07]That's probably, like, I'm assuming all carpet bombers are team colored, but if it's not... Let me know.
[58:35.93]I haven't seen that one either.
[58:38.88]I also never use sticky launchers.
[58:43.27]Yeah, we're on blue team, so it's bluer.
[58:53.13]Dude, we have 100 cases.
[58:55.03]We haven't even gotten through the first 50, and I'm happy with it.
[58:59.37]What's going on?
[59:07.97]Eh.
[59:12.64]Some of these better ones, I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do.
[59:15.40]Like if I could attach to any of these and think they're awesome.
[59:20.36]Like that.
[59:21.80]Cool stack track, but I'm not attached to like, oh cool, a flamethrower.
[59:27.26]Tip of the Hats is coming up.
[59:28.54]If you're unfamiliar with Tip of the Hats, it's a charity event.
[59:31.24]It's a one-step camp that's mostly focused on Team Fortress 2.
[59:34.49]It's next month, September 19th.
[59:37.41]I'm not sure how much I'm going to be involved with it yet, but I will be involved with the Jerm as well.
[59:44.44]People may remember last year I donated my Australian sniper rifle.
[59:51.52]And someone spent a lot of money for that.
[59:55.28]I'm going to be donating a bunch of items to that, so if you're like, dude, if you don't want it, give it to me!
[59:59.12]Because people are always like that.
[60:01.54]I just give it all to them, and they figure it out.
[60:04.91]Yes, the HUD is BudHUD.
[60:07.15]Any custom HUD, you see how it says A and D next to those?
[60:10.17]Some custom HUDs have this, some don't.
[60:11.85]I don't know why this isn't in the actual game, but if you press A or D, it changes.
[60:18.44]It does exactly what you're seeing me do.
[60:20.24]It's pretty much to explain what's happening there.
[60:25.71]And yeah, that's really awesome for sorting inventories.
[60:29.54]Night Owl.
[60:31.44]Back to renew.
[60:32.48]That's a cool one, too.
[60:33.26]Like, if I could get a, like, stat track unusual anything.
[60:37.84]Or if I could just say, like, what my favorite weapon out of all these are, that's actually probably my favorite one that was released.
[60:43.20]It's just... It's kinda extravagant.
[60:48.74]But at the same time, it's... It's pretty basic looking.
[60:55.83]Pretty simple.
[60:56.89]Just like, yeah, black sniper rifle.
[61:00.11]Make sure you don't use the hitman or any other weapons.
[61:02.87]Dude, found the server.
[61:04.73]Grats, dude.
[61:05.27]Time to leave it.
[61:14.82]Sounds weird without the ambient in the background.
[61:16.56]Is that opening?
[61:19.10]What is happening?
[61:27.23]What is actually happening?
[61:33.06]What?
[61:34.18]What?
[61:36.92]Okay.
[61:38.96]Is the timer restarting?
[61:42.93]Am I ever gonna get my loot?
[61:44.35]Dude, loot get.
[61:46.13]Thanks.
[61:48.29]Apparently leaving that server is not cool.
[61:51.31]I don't know why it left.
[62:02.80]I forgot what the command is so people, like, can't even join.
[62:05.26]It's like svlan0 or something.
[62:06.60]Sv... password blblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl
[62:30.13]Oh, wait, no.
[62:30.59]That was supposed to... Oh, I'm sorry.
[62:32.02]I'm sorry.
[62:32.38]Back to case opening.
[62:34.86]I know how people get when people don't do their designated task.
[62:41.46]I'll open powerhouse later.
[62:42.78]That's... That's a gun.
[62:44.26]Another one I haven't seen.
[62:47.41]It's well worn, so it kind of just looks like a mess.
[62:51.61]Okay.
[62:52.33]Okay.
[62:55.85]How have I not seen these, though?
[62:57.11]I mean, like, I looked at the update page, and, like, I just don't remember some of these.
[63:03.51]I definitely haven't seen some of them actually in-game.
[63:06.85]It's a real thing.
[63:08.83]I'm getting it.
[63:17.67]Stat track, ugly jungle.
[63:20.25]Now we got two of those, but one is mucho better.
[63:23.52]Why is it still... I don't want to hear the... I just want to hear the smooth... smooth air.
[63:31.54]In the administrator telling me when my mission begins.
[64:04.02]I'm trying to reach out.
[64:05.44]I'm really trying.
[64:07.22]I'm putting in the effort Yeah, none of these are tradable When I do become tradable, I'm gonna be moving which is a reminder I'm probably only going to be able to stream this week I don't think I'm gonna make another video for like the next two weeks Which is an awful thing to know ahead of time that just like this week I don't want to start on anything that I and then I don't I don't I'm moving this weekend
[64:39.83]Yeah, so I don't know what I'm gonna do I just know I have to move Like five left
[64:57.59]I don't think the password actually worked.
[64:58.77]I think you have to change maps for the password or something.
[65:00.91]I don't know.
[65:02.11]Yeah, there's people in the background.
[65:04.27]I don't care.
[65:04.86]Why did I get that?
[65:06.76]Would I just get a black box?
[65:08.12]I don't want it.
[65:12.34]You're messing up my inventory.
[65:25.70]I don't expect these last three to be anything super special.
[65:28.52]I feel like we got all of our specials.
[65:32.72]Now we're all very familiar with what is in concealed cases, because we have like a whole bunch of camouflage shotguns.
[65:42.66]It's not really that concealing.
[65:54.39]Damn.
[65:55.47]That's what we got.
[65:57.63]Am I missing one?
[65:58.99]Oh, no, I deleted one.
[66:00.39]Yeah, I remember.
[66:01.35]It was so bad, I deleted it.
[66:02.83]A couple of these probably were.
[66:05.42]But, um... Dude, that's the... That's how it works!
[66:10.60]Now this page is empty, so I can go back to the shop.
[66:15.68]And I can be like, hey, shop.
[66:20.51]Give me 50 of these.
[66:21.15]Give me 50.
[66:21.39]I need 50 of these.
[66:22.17]Give me... Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[66:25.18]Yes.
[66:26.14]Yes.
[66:31.37]Nice.
[66:38.54]We're going to open those in a little bit.
[66:42.46]Not right now.
[66:48.00]We're gonna go back on our other account, do some more contracts, and for anyone who only cares about boxes, um, I don't know.
[66:57.48]Wait a bit.
[66:57.96]I think, like, I, I like, I hate these gift bags.
[67:05.93]These gift bags are, like, insulting.
[67:10.09]They just, like, messed everything up.
[67:12.74]I like to have things organized when I open things.
[67:16.27]Get all these news out of here.
[67:18.19]I don't care how new you are.
[67:21.45]Where are my keys?
[67:25.55]They just ruined everything.
[67:27.65]On this page, there's like one... There's one... Valve.
[67:36.11]Fix your shit.
[67:37.71]You're putting- you're giving me free gifts and I'm pissed about it.
[67:41.89]There's a key.
[67:46.30]And... There's the key.
[67:48.52]All the way on the seventh page.
[67:50.42]Alright, so we're gonna switch accounts again.
[67:54.08]Do some more contracts and come back to those keys in a little bit, because um... Get rekt!
[68:01.37]I'm learning how to stream and play the game.
[68:17.67]Actual gameplay?
[68:18.75]I know.
[68:19.25]What are you doing playing the game?
[68:28.14]Kid doesn't know that all we want to see are boxes.
[68:35.48]No way to turn chat off?
[68:36.70]That's another thing.
[68:37.52]Like, I was pissed off about that before, too.
[68:39.09]I can't pop the chat out of the window so I can just... I, like, have to have the whole thing open for me.
[68:46.46]I have chat gripes.
[68:47.29]Otherwise, so far, do we have anything nice to say about YouTube streaming?
[68:51.97]Anybody been enjoying it?
[68:53.41]Chat aside.
[68:54.11]Because the chat complaints are very understandable.
[69:00.31]Oh, I don't want to thank anyone.
[69:05.68]Oh yeah, when you just buy a contract, you have to... It's only offering me one right now.
[69:12.30]I might go on another account that already has two and just do them on there.
[69:18.68]I'm back to that one later, because when you just buy a contract, it stores up all the campaign pass, it stores up all the contracts that you could potentially do that you haven't done yet.
[69:28.43]But it takes, like, it seems like 30 minutes to give you each one after that, at least.
[69:33.09]I don't know how long I've been streaming.
[69:35.03]You could try and figure that one out for yourself, because I don't know.
[69:38.17]It just takes a while.
[69:39.75]I thought changing accounts and coming back would have done something.
[69:43.70]Apparently not.
[69:45.86]very smooth video quality uh it should be higher quality than Twitch even um I'm gonna have to take a look back at it when I'm done because I can go much higher from where I'm at right now I haven't had any problem streaming I could probably bump it up to 60 FPS and everything and not have a problem it's felt very smooth on my end so that's good
[70:07.73]I do like that you can go back in time.
[70:09.09]Because even if the stream were lagging for you, you could just offset yourself 10 seconds back and watch it in whatever quality you want it.
[70:16.43]And then it wouldn't lag anymore, because it wouldn't technically be live for you anymore, you know?
[70:21.38]Some people might even be doing that right now.
[70:25.04]I mean, if you just joined and all you care about are cases, because, like, 200 people left.
[70:29.78]Just go back in time and watch the cases and... Do you.
[70:35.20]What do we got on this account?
[70:42.92]I'd have to turn off the stream to 60 FPS though, and I want this to all be one thing.
[70:47.28]At least for today.
[70:48.08]Every time I stream on YouTube, if I do it again.
[70:50.26]It wants me to play heavy again.
[70:53.04]We can bump up the quality each time.
[71:00.53]Bash enemy with a shield.
[71:01.27]Do I have a shield on this account?
[71:06.01]No.
[71:08.77]Can I rent one?
[71:13.33]Oh, it's called the, uh... No.
[71:16.49]It was there!
[71:16.95]Try it out.
[71:21.71]Yeah, I'm sure.
[71:27.44]Noice.
[71:28.76]This is one of the other accounts that I just don't have... anything.
[71:33.74]Oh, there's a case.
[71:35.43]I have a Huntsman.
[71:36.79]That's an achievement item, dudes.
[71:41.73]To join a server real quick doesn't have to be any particular ones.
[71:44.07]That's cool I kind of want to play powerhouse at the same time.
[71:52.66]I don't know
[71:55.91]Age restriction has stopped you from viewing?
[71:57.77]I don't know if there's something I could change there.
[72:00.39]I heard someone saying there was an age restriction thing earlier.
[72:03.28]And I don't know if there's anything I can do about that.
[72:05.46]I feel like there's supposed to be a choice for me where I can select... No, dude, anyone can watch this.
[72:11.10]18 plus, mature, teenage only, whatever TF2 is rated.
[72:17.51]There's bloody dead people, I don't know.
[72:19.91]Ratings are weird nowadays.
[72:27.44]Am I going to PAX?
[72:28.24]No.
[72:28.58]I'm moving this weekend, so going to PAX would have been awful, and Overwatch isn't even there.
[72:33.84]Which, uh, is quite disappointing.
[72:36.44]Not really.
[72:36.92]I'm excited that I don't have to go.
[72:38.41]It would have been a huge pain in the ass.
[72:39.83]I got most of my packing done today.
[72:41.33]There's just boxes all over my apartment.
[72:43.41]My apartment is the cleanest it has been in, like... Since... It's cleaner than when I moved in.
[72:50.59]Did my... Okay, no.
[72:52.41]Just because the server was little.
[72:54.79]Breaks everything.
[72:56.27]Yeah.
[72:57.81]My apartment's cleaner than when I moved in for sure.
[73:00.73]Which is...
[73:03.76]Sad, I suppose.
[73:05.34]Sad or happy or something.
[73:08.20]The name of the HUD is Bud HUD by WhiskerBiscuit.
[73:12.32]If you search up Bud HUD on Google, you'll find it.
[73:14.30]There's a couple versions of it.
[73:15.26]This one removes all the names as I'm repeating.
[73:17.39]I'm sure there's a ton of new people here that are like, Dude, your HUD's broke!
[73:21.23]I will be saying it.
[73:21.99]That's what makes it harder for people to come and ruin everything.
[73:27.37]Yeah, he's jumping out of there.
[73:28.45]He still has the health for that.
[73:33.85]That guy, his movement is insane.
[73:38.79]Give me this.
[73:39.11]I'm gonna mallet somebody.
[73:41.25]I've never used this weapon.
[73:43.13]Not that it does anything.
[73:44.67]It just hits people.
[73:48.70]Did he miss the stairs?
[73:50.66]Or did he not want to go on the stairs?
[73:52.44]I don't know.
[73:52.80]That medic, he's got the jukes.
[73:57.26]I felt like a friendly medic's trying to Ubersaw me.
[73:59.32]Whatever.
[73:59.64]We gotta get shield bashes.
[74:02.32]Or melee kills.
[74:03.74]Which would be easier if we actually had items on our account.
[74:07.52]That spy must have missed everyone.
[74:08.96]Pyro wants to go toe-to-toe.
[74:18.91]What hap- what just happened?
[74:22.04]That guy didn't lag once.
[74:24.46]He didn't lag once until I got near him and he teleported all around me and apparently shot me with a flare.
[74:30.24]I don't even know because I didn't look like he had a flare gun in his hand.
[74:33.92]Dude just wants to freaking teleport.
[74:38.78]My dog is broken?
[74:40.84]Oh, the spam dogs.
[74:44.12]They're broken.
[74:46.72]That's cool.
[74:49.40]Make a Borneo jump.
[74:51.02]Dude, contracts are all that matter anymore.
[74:52.94]Did my item server go down?
[74:57.44]Or did I accidentally press whatever the hotkey is?
[75:00.76]That totally screwed me up.
[75:06.41]I'm gonna die.
[75:07.01]Dude, if only I had a shield and took resist.
[75:10.21]Fire is dumb.
[75:11.03]Now defending.
[75:11.71]We lose.
[75:12.87]Yeah, I accidentally switched.
[75:13.87]I don't know what that hotkey even is that does that.
[75:16.85]But I do that all the time.
[75:18.11]Dude.
[75:20.62]By the time I spawn, we're gonna be losing.
[75:24.77]Spy is just taunting.
[75:27.01]Not a good day to play TF2 for me.
[75:36.86]No more Twitch?
[75:37.74]Not no more Twitch.
[75:38.56]I think even if... Best case scenario, YouTube Gaming is the greatest thing ever.
[75:44.34]Which is still yet to be seen, because I want to give it some time for them to update it.
[75:48.28]But even if YouTube Gaming is the best thing given to man, I'm probably still going to use Twitch to do other random streams of other games.
[76:00.01]Because it's awkward to me that... I don't know.
[76:05.15]I don't like alerting...
[76:08.38]every person who's subscribed to me.
[76:12.08]That like I'm streaming baby feet, or I don't know, something stupid.
[76:16.53]It just feels like I want to take a stream seriously.
[76:19.77]I'd probably want to use YouTube Gaming.
[76:25.39]If it were the best thing.
[76:27.37]Twitch streams could be a little bit curious.
[76:31.61]I absolutely have more of an audience on Twitch.
[76:33.91]On YouTube.
[76:34.89]It's just, it makes sense for me.
[76:55.09]Yeah, I know right now, um, YouTube streaming is blocked in Germany as well, which is dumb.
[77:00.58]YouTube has always had that problem, like, Jerma people are just, like, left out of the loop.
[77:04.80]So what I'm looking forward to see if I can get it to work exactly the way I want is just to have, um... Hold on, let me get, like, a million damage in there.
[77:23.51]Oh no, it's an uber chain medic.
[77:25.19]Your buddy didn't even come out with him.
[77:28.37]What I want to do is make a playlist of previous streams, but unlist the videos, so if you guys actually want to watch old YouTube streams, you could just go through that playlist and be like, oh, here's every single time he's ever streamed, and they exist forever, unlike Twitch that deletes them once every 30 days.
[77:48.70]Apparently that killed somebody.
[77:49.78]I think it was that scout that was chasing me.
[77:57.36]There's so many heavies.
[78:01.64]Dude, spy guy, get in there.
[78:05.30]I gotta... I gotta heal.
[78:07.60]All I gotta do, I gotta bash enemies with shields too.
[78:11.72]I haven't even been doing that.
[78:12.77]At least shield bashing heavies is easy.
[78:17.43]There's just gotta be, like, less than three of them.
[78:26.61]My health.
[78:28.01]Trying to come up here and get it, Spy?
[78:30.13]Screw you.
[78:30.53]I feel like I'm gonna get backstabbed.
[78:35.67]Oh my god, they're there again!
[78:39.24]We're gonna do some sneaky maneuvers.
[78:40.56]And by sneaky maneuvers, I mean... Fire sti- Fire- Oh, I'm so dead.
[78:57.44]No.
[78:59.10]Thank you spy buddy.
[79:00.22]And I'll help you out.
[79:03.81]It's tit for tat.
[79:06.09]Haha boob haha boob haha.
[79:09.23]Dude I'm like 8 years old.
[79:10.67]That shit's crazy.
[79:11.77]There we go.
[79:21.18]Get this rolling.
[79:22.00]Get outta here.
[79:30.05]I'm on to you.
[79:31.81]I'm so on to you.
[79:33.75]I'm on to you like we're dating.
[79:35.11]I'm on to you.
[79:36.57]Like, it's weird.
[79:41.80]I'm probably dead, though.
[79:42.58]Yeah.
[79:43.72]He, like, missed, but it's okay because it's a rocket launcher and there's, like, four people.
[79:54.69]We did a lot that life, I think.
[79:57.22]I think.
[79:57.60]I don't know.
[79:58.90]That's why I like killstreak weapons.
[80:01.08]It's easier to gauge what you actually did in a life.
[80:03.30]Like, oh, my killstreak... Oh, shit.
[80:05.68]Killstreak was like four.
[80:08.38]I remember that I got four kills now.
[80:14.88]No killstreak weapons?
[80:15.76]What's the point?
[80:17.68]A tree falls down in a tree place.
[80:21.05]Who heard the tree?
[80:28.25]Really?
[80:28.63]Did I kill him?
[80:30.75]I don't know.
[80:33.55]I didn't actually swing the weapon.
[80:35.11]I, like, waited a little bit too long.
[80:37.05]How do you find out if you're streaming?
[80:40.69]If you actually, I mean, if you look in the YouTube subscriptions thingy, I should just be at the very top of most recent videos released as, hey, he's streaming.
[80:51.95]It's live.
[80:53.29]Which is also really cool.
[80:58.95]I don't have to do anything special.
[81:00.20]I don't have to make a YouTube announcement that I'm streaming somewhere else.
[81:04.06]Which I never do anyway.
[81:05.04]I don't like doing that.
[81:07.14]There's a bunch of dudes over here.
[81:10.85]It's like we're in Dude Fortress right now.
[81:14.07]Go backstab him.
[81:14.87]He got him.
[81:27.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm on your team!
[81:29.22]Fight the guy who's shooting crit rockets at us, man!
[81:39.42]How- He hit me and not the soldier who was- I don't- I don't understand.
[81:44.24]This just released?
[81:45.96]Yes.
[81:47.42]This is very new.
[81:50.03]Guys, you see?
[81:50.71]You guys are calming down.
[81:51.73]Like, it got boring to spam.
[81:53.85]That's what happens.
[81:54.83]People get bored and they move on with their lives.
[81:58.58]sometimes.
[82:00.28]Most superhero villains are based on the fact that they haven't moved on with their lives though, so those people exist.
[82:07.05]They're just usually in Marvel comics.
[82:10.69]That's my expert analysis if you're interested.
[82:16.53]We're good up here.
[82:17.15]We good?
[82:18.07]We good.
[82:18.83]Let's actually go get the shield bashes so we can earn some points.
[82:31.97]Dude's a teleport.
[82:32.81]What?
[82:37.31]Fuck!
[82:39.11]Shit.
[82:40.05]I'm mad that I missed the pill in the first place on that scout.
[82:44.57]He was just going up.
[82:46.99]It's a whole other thing to charge into your missed pill.
[82:51.95]But I had to.
[82:52.61]I had to make a play.
[82:58.00]That's a good draw distance on that window.
[83:01.30]Always been a fan.
[83:04.24]Long time fan over here.
[83:16.85]Got him.
[83:17.25]I knew that wasn't going to kill him, which is... Made me not want to even go do it.
[83:22.17]It was the right thing to do, but my contract didn't think it was.
[83:25.73]Pyro missed him completely.
[83:26.91]That's... That's the life of a Pyro, man.
[83:34.59]You again.
[83:37.73]Not this time.
[83:40.04]Everyone gets bottled.
[83:42.26]Going back up there.
[83:47.00]I like holding this point.
[83:48.00]Like, pretty much, you know, you always have those, you do the same things on the maps that you always do.
[84:01.21]I don't know why I'm happy about that.
[84:03.10]Got him, man.
[84:10.95]When you get a contract, it's only for about the next three months.
[84:19.65]So it is a limited time.
[84:21.87]There's no specific date yet when it ends, but... Well, it's supposed to be about three to four months.
[84:26.63]And then the next contracts will start.
[84:28.79]And probably matchmaking will come out when this one ends.
[84:31.33]There we go.
[84:36.14]This advanced is also very easy to do.
[84:42.97]Come on!
[84:43.57]I just have to kill people with a melee weapon.
[84:50.66]Too bad I only have a bottle.
[84:51.88]Too bad I was walking after spawn.
[85:11.85]Refinestorming D- Oh dude, they're winning.
[85:16.55]That was very sudden.
[85:25.92]That's too bad.
[85:35.62]It's a rough life out here, man.
[85:36.84]I just want items.
[85:38.90]I don't even have it.
[85:43.91]I need to start earning some achievements.
[85:45.35]Like, what are the Demoman achievements?
[85:47.23]Like, what do I need to do?
[85:49.51]Give me... Here, we're searching this.
[85:51.63]Team Fortress 2.
[85:53.43]List of Demoman achievements.
[86:00.58]Also, join a different server while you do this, because people are already taunting in front of you.
[86:17.77]We're gonna get these cheeves, man.
[86:18.99]I can't... This achievement requires me to use the Eyelander.
[86:29.38]I'm trying to earn the Eyelander over here, man.
[86:39.10]This is all too complicated for me.
[86:40.46]I don't understand what numbers are.
[86:47.51]They're in the game?
[86:48.11]I know they're in the game, but... It's easier to have this on another monitor for me.
[86:55.39]All of these are, like, decapitating people.
[87:02.70]Or will take longer than ten seconds.
[87:04.44]Get three kills within six seconds using the Demoman Charge.
[87:13.24]I mean...
[87:17.45]Oh, you need the Tide Turner for that.
[87:21.89]Destroy 50 buildings.
[87:25.23]Kill two people in a single sticky jump.
[87:27.65]That's true, I haven't even sticky jumped.
[87:28.91]I think for just... Wait, no, yeah, I did earlier.
[87:31.69]Just, like, give you achievements for that.
[87:35.93]Let's fulfill this contract so maybe we can get the next one as soon as possible.
[87:39.25]Oh, wait, no.
[87:39.83]We're doing the advanced.
[87:41.43]Never mind.
[87:41.83]It said fulfilled on the side, and I got excited.
[87:44.21]I thought I did the other one.
[87:45.15]Everyone was... I just...
[87:48.09]You can't expect me to remember everything.
[87:55.75]Got him.
[87:57.19]What's going on around here?
[87:58.17]Are we at last or are we not at last?
[88:08.40]He's... he's a dead man.
[88:13.14]Wow, I wonder where the sentry is going to be on upward.
[88:16.51]Not there?
[88:16.95]Really?
[88:22.01]I missed it!
[88:23.13]I... Why did I miss?
[88:25.95]I had a brief consideration that I wanted to jump inside that hole to just get away from him, but I think his minigun, like, pushed me back from it.
[88:37.20]Oh, I got all messed up.
[88:41.52]Kill a parachuting player while parachuting, dude.
[88:43.90]Give me a contract.
[88:46.90]Give me a- not a con- an achievement.
[88:49.46]Give me an achievement I can understand.
[88:52.21]I don't know what parachutes are, I just installed this game.
[88:54.69]I ain't never played this before.
[88:58.51]We're going back to spawn.
[89:11.04]Oh, that's not our spawn.
[89:12.20]We haven't capped the point yet?
[89:19.27]Medics?
[89:20.53]Those exist in this game?
[89:21.75]Dude, I've never seen them before.
[89:23.58]Can they revive people?
[89:24.52]Do they have defibrillators?
[89:27.42]Is this joke going still?
[89:28.60]There's something we're doing.
[89:33.14]We committed to this.
[89:33.84]I don't think so.
[89:48.37]Let's try, dude.
[89:52.36]Haha.
[89:56.44]Hahaha.
[89:58.80]Dude, get out of here.
[90:00.54]Dude, who'd you... Oh, I did it again!
[90:03.36]That one was unnecessary, and I got balanced.
[90:06.54]Fuck TF2 today.
[90:09.50]Even though that was my own fault.
[90:10.86]Why am I the one that keeps getting balanced?
[90:12.70]I wanted to be on blue.
[90:14.02]I came and I was like, hey, let me be a blue guy.
[90:18.56]Why did I do that?
[90:21.41]I just, like...
[90:23.45]I just got scared, man.
[90:25.55]I didn't know that Scott was about to get headshot or whatever happened.
[90:29.09]I felt like I had to go.
[90:35.78]Right in the hole.
[90:36.66]No, not in the hole.
[90:38.18]Not hole-bound, dude.
[90:41.11]It was a crit one, too.
[90:42.45]It was right there lined up for me to die.
[90:53.02]I'm not sure if you're lagging or I can't hit you, or I'm lagging.
[91:01.90]It seemed like he was teleporting like just enough.
[91:05.49]These scouts everywhere, man.
[91:06.73]I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to bash some dudes.
[91:13.89]Scout got backstabbed?
[91:14.81]I didn't see a spy.
[91:15.69]Maybe he was that good of a spy.
[91:24.82]That trap's gonna kill him.
[91:26.36]Guaranteed.
[91:26.94]Yeah, Pyro's dead.
[91:28.16]See ya.
[91:28.70]You don't need the names on the kill feed to know that that sticky trap killed that Pyro.
[91:42.11]I walk forward now?
[91:43.41]Eh, I'm gonna go get this full health kit.
[91:50.45]You ain't gonna stop me.
[91:51.25]I ain't gonna take it.
[92:03.61]Damn it, I hit the wall.
[92:05.81]How could I be so foolish?
[92:09.87]That crit didn't kill you?
[92:12.49]Who are you, Iron Man?
[92:14.39]Who are these players?
[92:16.27]The Hulk?
[92:17.22]You one of the Avengers, dude?
[92:20.80]You're just walking over crits.
[92:22.18]I'm like not getting... All I want to do... All I ever want to do in TF2...
[92:32.36]is play Scout, Soldier, or Sniper.
[92:38.94]Ster, play Overwatch.
[92:40.50]That's... That's gonna happen.
[92:45.17]Oh my lord.
[92:45.99]I was distracted by an Eyelander.
[92:50.97]You know there's achievements associated with the Eyelander?
[92:53.38]You guys know there's some achievements you can get?
[93:07.80]The melee kills I should but then like then I have to play heavy Their contract is heavy a nice crit, dude It's screw those hallways
[93:31.18]I wanna go fight in... He just... No.
[93:34.14]Okay, I thought he face-stabbed the hell out of that man.
[93:37.13]He shot him with a gun.
[93:38.41]What a spy.
[93:39.05]He knows he has those.
[93:46.95]Try it again.
[93:47.43]I'm out.
[93:58.72]I'm out.
[93:59.78]I'm out.
[94:00.66]We outie.
[94:01.92]Let me reload a bit.
[94:02.62]I don't know where that guy was jumping, anyway.
[94:07.17]That's such a shit place to have, like, a Sticky Jumper.
[94:09.75]He had a Sticky Jumper, right?
[94:10.95]Whoa.
[94:11.51]Air shot.
[94:13.41]That's two for two.
[94:19.14]Could you not?
[94:19.94]I couldn't even charge.
[94:21.52]Couldn't do anything.
[94:22.68]I just had to watch.
[94:34.51]It's time to go.
[94:37.03]I just got the achievement U-turn.
[94:39.19]What about that was a U-turn?
[94:41.20]I ran straight at the dude.
[94:43.22]You can't even turn with shields anymore.
[94:44.90]It's not fooling anyone.
[94:53.23]Yeah, that's a teleporting man.
[95:01.00]Yeah, that's the teleporting man.
[95:05.24]He's got some advanced teleporting techniques going on there.
[95:13.61]Oh, no, no, no!
[95:17.99]Please!
[95:25.50]Hold on.
[95:27.09]We're taking a break.
[95:28.23]Sometimes you just need to take a chill pill.
[95:29.77]You know what I mean?
[95:30.51]You just need to shoot at your spawn by accident.
[95:35.95]This is all thanks to the Eyelander, by the way.
[95:37.67]Can I stop getting bled by you?
[95:45.74]Oh, because I touched the cabinet, I didn't have the Eyelander anymore.
[95:48.44]That's why we died.
[95:49.30]See, it was all thanks to the Eyelander until we got rid of it by accident.
[95:52.44]That's when you lose.
[95:55.97]It's a state of mind.
[95:57.89]I only understand how this game is played when I have a sword.
[96:00.93]When I don't have a sword, it just all falls apart.
[96:04.89]Can I unbox?
[96:22.98]Oh yeah.
[96:23.95]People want me to unbox things.
[96:25.17]I forgot.
[96:25.87]I was having fun pubbing.
[96:27.32]Let me finish these contracts and then we'll unbox more.
[96:32.80]I'm gonna go play on a server.
[96:51.49]That music is really fun to have there for like 30 seconds.
[96:53.89]I don't know why I bother.
[96:54.75]I need to have like more ambient something there.
[96:56.52]It's very, um... Very loud.
[97:08.10]Let's just let's focus on the contract.
[97:10.52]Kill a couple dudes.
[97:12.04]Let's get someone like this guy right here with the Tide Turner is gonna drop a sword.
[97:15.26]We're following him.
[97:16.48]What movie was that where like people are invading Stalingrad and they're like pick up a sword.
[97:20.52]No, not a sword.
[97:21.22]Pick up a gun.
[97:22.20]If you don't have a gun you wait to pick up the guy's gun and the guy does it and it's like enemy at the gates or something.
[97:27.38]We're enemying at the gates this dude.
[97:29.02]He's gonna die.
[97:29.70]We don't trust him.
[97:30.48]He sucks like we're an amazing sniper.
[97:33.58]Sword.
[97:34.00]We're a sword guy.
[97:37.16]This dude's gonna die.
[97:39.28]And he's gonna die.
[97:40.06]Oh, he has the cannon as well.
[97:41.76]That'd be fun to use.
[97:42.56]I think these references are a little bit too advanced for some users.
[97:49.47]We gotta tone it down.
[97:50.35]Where's he going?
[97:57.69]This guy's not gonna die if there's no red people.
[97:59.63]Come on, dude.
[98:06.81]Just
[98:10.39]Just go die.
[98:15.83]I don't want to lose track of him.
[98:16.67]Here, I'll take this.
[98:17.69]Ha ha!
[98:20.71]He died!
[98:23.62]I'm at the gates.
[98:24.56]I'm at the gates!
[98:26.40]Get double donked!
[98:27.30]See, I use it better than you!
[98:29.38]I'm the sniper guy.
[98:31.32]I'm the guy with the references.
[98:34.52]Get like, kinda, sorta double donked.
[98:36.24]That was like a ground donking.
[98:41.64]And then we win?
[98:42.90]And then we win?
[98:43.50]And there's an Eyelander.
[98:45.55]Dude, I just need some equipment.
[98:47.31]I just need some items, man.
[98:51.67]Someone help me out.
[98:52.49]There we go.
[99:04.25]YouTube, why are you buffering today?
[99:05.57]If you're buffering, just go back in time a little bit.
[99:07.71]Go back, go back like a minute.
[99:10.72]Or just like pause for a little bit.
[99:12.46]Where'd that demo go?
[99:13.22]This guy looks like he's got some items, man.
[99:15.46]We got a sword.
[99:16.04]Gonna drop a sword somewhere for me?
[99:18.50]Or is that the guy up there?
[99:19.44]I think that was him way up there.
[99:26.00]So we gotta go follow him.
[99:37.14]Oh, couldn't... couldn't make that turn.
[99:39.18]Oh my god, there's the sword!
[99:44.90]Health!
[99:45.32]Health!
[99:52.13]We're unbeatable!
[99:53.63]Unbeatable!
[99:54.39]Dude, get the fuck out of here!
[99:55.47]Get the fuck out of here!
[99:59.93]I need that sword!
[100:01.91]I need that sword!
[100:02.50]Like, you know, please!
[100:03.52]Please!
[100:04.20]I put in so much work.
[100:08.11]Dude, that's a weapon.
[100:09.01]I'm pissed off about that one.
[100:18.35]I earned that.
[100:28.65]Let's go.
[100:29.09]Now we have to, like, find the guy again so we can enemy at the gates him.
[100:39.16]Eat shit, shit eaters.
[100:44.43]That's what shit eaters do.
[100:46.99]They eat it.
[100:52.69]Oh.
[100:54.53]Well that, that was inevitable.
[100:57.23]I might have been able to charge out, but then he'd just light me on fire more.
[101:03.15]Pyros, man.
[101:11.83]I'm a wizard?
[101:12.37]I don't want to be a wizard.
[101:19.63]Revenge.
[101:21.81]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[101:27.65]The stupid scout had to jump right into it.
[101:30.47]Took so much damage.
[101:32.49]YouTube player is better but chat is worse.
[101:34.33]Yeah, that's kind of what I expected today.
[101:37.44]It's odd that people are saying it's so much smoother than Twitch 2, because I've actually streamed 60 FPS on... ...F2 on Twitch.
[101:44.86]Well, I don't know.
[101:46.66]I feel like I could be streaming 60 FPS right now, I just don't want to restart the stream.
[101:50.21]The player is definitely much better.
[101:51.67]I think that goes without saying.
[101:54.51]And if we can actually make an unlisted playlist, the VOD system is also going to be better.
[102:01.80]And people actually follow me on YouTube, so that's better.
[102:05.72]We got some pros, we got some cons.
[102:07.28]What I keep comparing it to again is when YouTube comment system changed for the first time, for the first month, it was unbearable, unusable.
[102:14.54]Everyone turned off their chats, like PewDiePie, like everyone turned off their chats that month.
[102:20.65]All the dudes.
[102:22.65]Universally agreed that it was awful.
[102:25.17]It took like a month and then it was fine.
[102:26.83]That's what it is now.
[102:27.98]That's alright.
[102:30.46]No complaints from me.
[102:38.55]So, I think in a month.
[102:41.21]I mean, my whole life is based around this fact, but hopefully, again, by the time Overwatch comes out, it'll work.
[102:46.41]Dude, drop your sword, drop your sword!
[102:49.31]Yes!
[102:57.79]Now we're just gonna destroy people.
[103:00.95]And we got healed.
[103:02.31]And we're overhealed.
[103:10.37]Let's go I Don't want to fight in here Yeah, we don't got any we don't got any friends.
[103:26.31]Oh, he's a friend We have a head.
[103:28.78]Oh, yeah.
[103:28.98]I just killed that guy.
[103:30.16]We got some heads.
[103:30.78]Oh
[103:40.37]Whoa.
[103:41.03]Whoa.
[103:42.09]Whoa, he's fast.
[103:49.27]Fuck.
[103:53.30]I'm gonna blame the sword on that one.
[103:54.78]See, if I didn't have one of those, it was weighing me down.
[103:56.76]That was pretty heavy, dude.
[103:58.24]They're heavy.
[103:59.16]You ever use a two-handed sword before?
[104:00.54]They're really hard to swing.
[104:02.10]Never see them.
[104:06.05]Monty Python.
[104:07.33]The Holy Grail.
[104:08.51]With two guys fighting with two giant swords.
[104:11.73]It's rough.
[104:12.49]Takes a long time.
[104:13.36]I think that's what happened to me.
[104:20.04]When you donate it's missed, did someone actually use that feature?
[104:23.24]I just assumed in this mess of a chat no one was actually using that.
[104:26.47]I tested it out earlier to see what it was.
[104:30.43]I don't see any.
[104:33.56]I was capable of reading a comment, though, which by any amount of the imagination should be praised.
[104:40.62]Oh, I don't have an Eyelander anymore.
[104:41.74]There you go.
[104:46.87]I like this guy.
[104:47.39]He keeps giving them to me.
[104:48.23]If only I could pick up Tide Turners, because there was a Tide Turner on the ground as well.
[105:03.74]Oh come on.
[105:04.24]I want some health.
[105:12.27]My right ear suddenly started ringing.
[105:13.81]Is it because of this sword?
[105:15.23]Is this sword too heavy for my right ear?
[105:19.26]Why only my right ear?
[105:20.24]What's wrong with the ear, man?
[105:25.24]Let's actually get this going.
[105:32.25]I wonder if that's a spy.
[105:33.15]We're just constantly low health, man.
[105:40.19]Why am I going up this way?
[105:41.25]This way sucks.
[105:47.23]I really didn't think that was gonna kill me, either.
[105:48.77]I think it directed me, though.
[105:55.91]Because the moderation tools are garbage, and they can't really do anything.
[106:04.58]There's very little people can do, which, again, I keep saying, I feel like will be fixed in a month.
[106:15.37]This guy is just, like, handing them to me.
[106:17.09]We finished that contract.
[106:18.83]That's one contract closer to opening another 50 cases.
[106:27.58]Or I could play the game.
[106:28.48]I don't know.
[106:30.96]Either one.
[106:36.86]we came over here again why I like hate going this way you know what I'm gonna go up in the window around that was a far-fetched attempt that's all I'm saying like if he was a Pokémon far fetch
[107:04.29]Yeah, that dude's far fetched.
[107:05.63]There's so many devil men with swords now.
[107:22.60]Really?
[107:25.08]I didn't shield bash you?
[107:26.72]Okay, whatever.
[107:27.46]Doesn't matter.
[107:28.25]Turn that contract in.
[107:36.94]I would really just prefer at this point to turn chat off but then I don't know.
[107:40.61]How could you test it?
[107:42.01]How could you?
[107:49.51]Destroy engineer buildings are there even engineers on the other team?
[108:04.20]Oh, gee willikers.
[108:05.30]I'm gonna pretend I'm alone.
[108:07.32]I'm never gonna talk again.
[108:09.90]Seriously?!
[108:10.62]That gave me an achievement?
[108:14.98]Croc Block?
[108:16.52]Your achievement is just stand in front of a crit rocket?
[108:21.08]I did it!
[108:23.38]Got hit with a crit, man.
[108:29.66]Sorry, I'm playing heavy.
[108:35.75]Ow.
[108:36.05]Sorry, that guy has the Sydney Sleeper.
[108:42.64]I don't know if I can actually turn chat off after the stream has already gone live.
[108:47.62]I'm pretty unfamiliar with this whole system.
[108:57.67]Oh, there actually is a place where you can see if people did a money situation.
[109:01.94]Crime Wizard, thank you.
[109:03.82]Multiple anonymous people.
[109:06.02]Maybe just trying out the system with one euros.
[109:10.94]Crime Wizard happy and still playing TF2.
[109:12.78]That's cool.
[109:16.38]Wow.
[109:16.60]I don't want to go punch that man.
[109:28.82]Oh, my only weakness.
[109:31.82]I'm pretty sure that Mini-Sentry did more damage to me before I could destroy it.
[109:35.49]Actually, yeah, it did like 180 to me.
[109:39.25]The Minigun vs. Mini-Sentry battle.
[109:41.05]Timeless.
[109:41.83]Timeless stuff.
[109:46.15]Oh, I can disable chat.
[109:50.38]I want to see if that retroactively just happens.
[109:53.32]I'm curious.
[109:54.06]I don't think it's gonna.
[110:00.67]But it, like, stopped on my screen.
[110:03.51]So maybe.
[110:04.11]I gotta, like, refresh the page.
[110:06.44]We're learning.
[110:06.98]It's experimental.
[110:07.84]I'm probably gonna turn it back on.
[110:08.92]I'd rather have people spamming than nothing there at all.
[110:13.60]People like their spam.
[110:14.58]Yeah, okay, cool.
[110:15.42]Now we can test.
[110:16.10]I'm pretty sure that just, like, stopped everything.
[110:23.32]At the same time... Oh, yeah.
[110:24.68]It's just... It's gone.
[110:28.74]You refresh the page.
[110:29.67]I put it back.
[110:31.30]There you go.
[110:31.86]People, have fun with your, um, your horrible memes, your... I mean... Life sucks.
[110:39.47]Your life sucks.
[110:40.35]So just type, type for a bit.
[110:42.29]You'll feel better.
[110:44.75]It's all okay.
[110:46.73]You don't have to go to the dentist.
[110:48.07]I know you don't, I know, I know you don't like the dentist.
[110:50.23]You don't have to go.
[110:50.87]Is that a spy?
[110:57.65]Of course there was a spy on my head.
[111:09.62]That's definitely a spy.
[111:18.82]He really wants it!
[111:20.66]That's... You don't... You don't get that.
[111:29.14]Oh, we win.
[111:30.80]Let me get these, like, bonus end-round points.
[111:35.62]That's how you fill a contract, dude.
[111:38.20]You walk into their spawn.
[111:41.53]Okay, I have to refresh my page again to get chat back.
[111:43.79]I want that, right?
[111:44.51]That's something I'm into.
[111:49.96]I feel bad, too, because, like, all the talking I've done about the chat, like, if someone goes back and watches this VOD, they'll be like, oh, I wonder how YouTube streaming went.
[111:57.50]I'm gonna, like, watch it post.
[111:59.40]Hey, hey, thank you for watching it post.
[112:01.82]I'm waving to you right now.
[112:02.92]I respect you.
[112:04.17]I acknowledge your existence.
[112:10.68]And, um, you can't see the chat, so you don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[112:14.22]Just assume you know.
[112:16.64]Ow, he got there really fast and uncloaked pretty equally quickly.
[112:21.67]I don't think I'm gonna do the advanced for this.
[112:26.11]I have a new contract?
[112:29.69]On Borneo?
[112:31.11]Here, here.
[112:34.62]I'm cool with turning this into not doing the advance.
[112:36.74]I don't care about this account.
[112:37.98]You don't get better items or anything if you do advance.
[112:39.98]People think that.
[112:40.74]That's not true.
[112:41.44]You just get more points towards your campaign thingy.
[112:44.63]Get a cool shotgun.
[112:49.89]I have a whole bunch of people here who only care about me already.
[112:52.85]So it's time to leave the server anyway.
[112:54.33]Because they're trying to ruin my authentic pub experience.
[112:58.18]And we're going to change accounts and open the other 50 cases.
[113:00.40]Which is what everyone in the world has been waiting for.
[113:10.79]I made it worse?
[113:12.43]Sorry.
[113:12.75]It is kinda worse.
[113:24.68]Did I get Contracts so fast?
[113:26.50]Um... That one was just kinda lucky.
[113:30.14]But, I mean, that's a brand new account with the, uh, Contract, which is also why I have no weapons.
[113:35.67]And why we're changing accounts right now.
[113:37.67]Hold on!
[114:00.24]We're in sub mode?
[114:10.49]I wish.
[114:15.93]That's another thing that I expect they're going to do.
[114:19.29]Any complaint you have, expect they're going to do it.
[114:22.71]They had a beta for YouTube Gaming, but it's not like anyone was actually using it.
[114:27.40]So it was just kind of like, does the site look like... Like, is anything awfully broken?
[114:31.06]And a lot of people don't like the layout of the website.
[114:33.00]I'm kind of... I don't mind the layout of, like, the actual stream pages, but YouTube Gaming, I'm not 100% sold on.
[114:38.90]I'm probably used to it.
[114:39.78]I mean, it is new and all that, but... Eh.
[114:43.76]You know how it is.
[114:44.32]I'm used to it.
[114:53.81]Merry Christmas, dude.
[114:55.39]Let's back to open up those cases.
[114:59.45]Should have the keys on this page.
[115:01.35]Yep, there's all 50 keys.
[115:02.57]If you weren't here before, go back in the VOD.
[115:06.58]You can do that and see all that.
[115:09.20]Gonna be opening these cases now.
[115:10.36]We have a lot of powerhouse this time.
[115:12.56]Don't have all powerhouse, but we have a lot of powerhouse.
[115:17.62]Gonna do that.
[115:24.87]Night Owl Man.
[115:25.69]And these are all we're gonna... Like, 100 keys is how much money?
[115:31.63]If they're 250 each, isn't that just $250?
[115:35.49]Can this thing stop refilling me for a moment?
[115:40.15]I don't want to be refilled right now.
[115:42.24]Actually... That doesn't... I don't know.
[115:50.74]Stop the timer, but for some reason, it didn't work.
[115:53.42]Maybe you have to turn cheats, I don't know.
[115:55.64]Oh no, I know what you have to do.
[115:58.29]No one cares.
[115:59.07]People care about the cases.
[116:07.21]Dude, that's like exactly what I wanted before.
[116:09.41]That's what I was talking about.
[116:10.99]That's like, I like that sniper and it's a stat track, and I don't like factory new.
[116:14.63]Maybe that one looks better with factory new.
[116:18.06]I don't know.
[116:20.38]Who really knows?
[116:21.06]People have already shown up to ruin everything.
[116:22.82]Let's just not be in a server.
[116:27.48]We can totally inspect these.
[116:28.78]Yeah, I mean, it's pretty... It's, like, not badly scratched.
[116:34.76]I mean, I drop it down the stairs a couple of times, but... Why has this been going so well?
[116:43.75]We're two in, man.
[116:49.44]We're three in, and two out of three of them have been good.
[116:53.28]Battle's scarred, but I mean, at least it's the purples.
[116:58.23]You know in Diablo, when a purple drops, you're like, dude, are purples good in Diablo?
[117:02.81]I don't know, but they just keep dropping.
[117:06.69]That one's factory new, too.
[117:08.41]They just, they just... I'm gonna do all the concealed first.
[117:17.62]So we can get those out of the way and start on the powerhouses.
[117:23.81]Thanks for the 420 booty wizard, that's what I want to see there.
[117:34.16]I wonder if I actually sold all this stuff how much money I would make back.
[117:38.40]I'm going to have to look up some of this stuff once we're done with the unboxing and really figure it out for those of you who don't know, don't care, might potentially care, passively interested.
[117:48.62]Oh, that's worth $10.
[117:49.13]Okay, I don't care.
[117:50.85]Not that that one is.
[117:51.75]That's your reaction to me figuring out what everything's worth.
[117:55.87]Search that shit up on the Steam.
[117:58.11]Because I apparently have a lot of night terrors I can get rid of.
[118:03.67]That one also had the TF logo on there.
[118:08.38]Wow, so fascinating.
[118:10.04]So interesting.
[118:15.81]Just keeps giving them to me.
[118:17.97]Everyone is jealous.
[118:18.99]I want one.
[118:23.84]I want a flamethrower.
[118:25.16]I don't want a flamethrower.
[118:31.90]Uh...
[118:33.78]Factory new Night Terror is like $5 on the market.
[118:37.36]Field tested, which I... No, minimal wear, which is one level below that, is like $1.50.
[118:41.50]Anything below that is like 50 cents.
[118:45.14]So anything that isn't factory new of them is like still pretty like... Eh, you want a quarter for that, man?
[118:50.62]I don't really know how much all this stuff has been worth.
[118:54.49]There is a well-worn carpet bomber.
[118:56.35]I'm kind of interested in myself, passively.
[119:00.73]I'm the guy who's passively interested.
[119:16.00]They don't look like they're worth anything I haven't got one of those yet.
[119:20.40]Did I just unbox a powerhouse Baxin or was that actually in concealed and we just didn't get any of them?
[119:26.55]You know Only one I probably didn't have from it
[119:42.34]Delete everything.
[119:44.32]Delete it all.
[119:46.10]Delete the masked mender.
[119:47.38]I mean, the prices of some of this stuff has dropped like crazy because it's been out for a while.
[119:56.31]I don't know who was buying this shit.
[120:00.03]When it was, like, just released.
[120:01.63]People were buying cases for $10.
[120:04.27]Guys, guys, don't do that.
[120:08.63]My best advice I can give you is to never do that.
[120:17.51]Cases are, like, $0.10 now.
[120:18.39]You spent $9.90 on nothing.
[120:27.87]Nothing.
[120:28.33]Unless, like, I mean, you're a hardcore trader, dude.
[120:31.01]You probably made a profit in the first week if you're in... Where's the excitement?
[120:36.76]Nothing's been really good yet.
[120:41.06]I'll throw my chair across the room when I get an unusual.
[120:43.68]And it's gonna hit all my boxes over onto the floor.
[120:45.78]There's your excitement.
[120:48.68]This needs to happen first.
[120:49.80]We on to the powerhouse now?
[120:51.02]Get some goodies.
[121:01.15]I said some goodies That's just like snow covered garbage She's a brick house I don't know who thought it was a good idea to skin a weapon with brick textures.
[121:23.45]I
[121:24.73]Did you just have a brick texture laying around and you're like, I'll put this on a weapon.
[121:30.26]I'm gonna stat track it.
[121:31.10]That's okay.
[121:33.04]I'm cool with it.
[121:34.58]Brick house reference.
[121:35.58]Yeah, I'm okay with that brick house reference.
[121:43.26]Yeah, that's a flamethrower.
[121:44.90]It's slightly colored different.
[121:46.29]Yeah, okay.
[121:48.43]Okay so far.
[121:53.13]Overreacting at YouTube Cash?
[121:54.43]Dude, if I upload this as a video, I need to have like a super crazy reaction face.
[121:58.97]And where's, dude, where's the facecam?
[122:00.45]I need to see your reaction to these sick skins, dude.
[122:05.13]I bet you're flipping out over there.
[122:06.53]I bet your eyes are so open and your mouth is open and you're like passively interested.
[122:10.67]Whoa, it's a Black Dahlia!
[122:12.29]Whoa!
[122:14.87]There's a lightning bolt on it.
[122:16.27]Dude, one of them's a yellow lightning bolt.
[122:18.82]I bet that yellow one's rare.
[122:20.65]Dude.
[122:21.99]Who's gonna give me $50 for my black day?
[122:27.15]I wonder what my life would be like.
[122:33.68]How is that going?
[122:40.61]I wonder if there actually would be more people watching these if I was overreacting, had face cams, and put a thumbnail that was me overreacting with a facecam.
[122:49.47]Does that actually work, or are people just all idiots?
[122:51.54]I'm going to assume it does.
[122:53.64]Because, I mean, why else would everyone do it?
[123:02.04]I'm going to zoom-zoom these.
[123:05.56]I'd rather play the game over here.
[123:10.57]Okay, I said I was gonna throw my chair.
[123:20.54]I gotta get it now.
[123:29.87]I mean, like, I made a promise.
[123:33.17]I fucked everything up.
[123:38.59]I feel like someone's gonna knock at my door and be like, are you okay?
[123:41.41]I just heard the elevator, like, get to the top floor.
[123:43.45]Like, dude, are you alright?
[123:47.15]I totally fucked this chair up, man.
[123:49.51]That's cool.
[123:50.07]I haven't even seen that there's, like, a cold effect.
[123:55.21]And it's factory new.
[123:56.14]How much is this shit worth?
[124:04.18]That's gotta be worth, like, a fuckton, right?
[124:06.90]Am I crazy?
[124:12.88]There is an unusual sandstone special pistol factory new on the market for $189.
[124:17.20]What effect is it?
[124:20.72]It is... It's the hot effect.
[124:24.00]This is the cold effect.
[124:25.00]So I'd have to assume this is worth... There's another one, minimal wear, that's $170.
[124:29.99]Another one, well worn, that's $150.
[124:31.19]So yeah, this is like a almost $200 item.
[124:32.97]I'd say this was pretty worth it.
[124:40.50]I'm like out of breath from throwing my chair.
[124:43.16]Yeah, so it's about $180.
[124:44.12]Today was a good day.
[124:48.65]Dude, I spent... I mean, when you consider I bought 100 cases, I bought most of them.
[124:55.17]I bought 100 keys, which is about $250.
[125:00.84]Some of the other items are probably worth quite a bit.
[125:03.04]Let's toss that on my scout, man.
[125:09.32]Eh, we'll look at it at the end.
[125:11.22]We'll just finish opening up the rest of them.
[125:13.16]Throw that on Scout guy.
[125:14.12]You can see it there.
[125:20.72]I haven't actually seen an unusual pistol.
[125:22.44]Like, I'm gonna have to use pistols on Scout now.
[125:24.41]The fuck?
[125:24.99]I don't wanna use it.
[125:26.13]I like the Winger!
[125:26.89]I'm a fan of the Winger!
[125:27.85]Doesn't work.
[125:28.95]Too bad, it's not a Winger.
[125:30.71]You're screwed, kid.
[125:32.65]Complain about your under $80 weapon.
[125:40.85]Nothing's gonna top that now.
[125:42.01]That one looks kind of better when it's not battle scarred.
[125:47.06]It looks like an actual interesting idea.
[125:48.84]There's another one, but it's not glowing.
[125:59.24]Who cares, man?
[126:00.94]Get some glowing shit.
[126:05.15]Worth a shit ton because of multi-class, that's true.
[126:07.25]It is a pistol.
[126:07.87]I mean, engineers could use them.
[126:08.93]But it is like a secondary weapon that you don't have out much.
[126:11.11]I'm sure, like, the rocket launcher, snipers, shotguns... Even shotguns, because it's a primary for engineer, are worth quite a bit more.
[126:18.22]But I don't really know.
[126:20.50]It is still... a thing.
[126:26.07]We'll see if I'm bored of it before Tip of the Hats comes out.
[126:28.37]There's another one of the perps.
[126:31.19]That ugly lightning purple skin that Maela actually loves.
[126:34.79]I might give that one to Maela as soon as I can actually trade it in September.
[126:39.77]September 2nd.
[126:47.92]September isn't that far away.
[126:50.48]I gotta move.
[126:51.48]I won't even be around September 2nd.
[126:55.42]Wonder how long it's gonna take me to get internet set up at my new place.
[127:00.76]Probably a while.
[127:01.42]It's taken Jerma a long time.
[127:10.29]I use pistol constantly.
[127:11.73]Plox give to me.
[127:12.71]I mean, you asked for it.
[127:14.59]I guess I'll give it to you.
[127:17.14]I don't see any other reason why I wouldn't give it to that guy.
[127:20.08]He asked.
[127:25.51]Give all my civic duties to Jerma.
[127:27.51]Yeah, give Jerma this frickin' McDonald's gun.
[127:29.91]He could really use a couple more of those.
[127:41.44]Ooh, a cow gun.
[127:42.60]Ooh, I could shoot cows with that and I wouldn't even get arrested.
[127:49.50]Why am I always moving?
[127:50.70]Last time I moved, dude, mine was a factory, new one.
[127:54.60]What's that worth?
[127:55.50]What's the monetary value on these things?
[128:00.06]I gotta sneeze.
[128:01.70]HELP ME!
[128:06.60]Oh!
[128:07.02]Ooh!
[128:07.76]Ah!
[128:08.56]Three dollars and twenty-three cents.
[128:14.99]Exciting.
[128:20.68]It's actually kind of... shit.
[128:24.11]I was excited for some of those Factory New Purples before.
[128:26.69]I mean, I guess... I don't know, $3 seems, like, really low.
[128:29.95]I'm surprised.
[128:32.45]I suppose it is a flamethrower.
[128:33.67]No one even uses flamethrowers, but, you know.
[128:45.76]Oh, there's Battle Scarred Shellshocker.
[128:48.28]Good.
[128:48.60]Ninja Turtles represent Ninja Turtles.
[128:52.19]They're pretty battle-worn, dude, fighting Shredder all the time.
[129:02.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, okay, yeah, okay.
[129:10.27]Goddamn, I'm reacting to unboxings right now.
[129:12.67]I'm curious about that as well.
[129:19.07]I'm learning about the TF2 market right now.
[129:25.34]We're educating ourselves.
[129:30.20]That's the stat track one.
[129:32.58]And it's field tested.
[129:38.35]I can't even find one.
[129:39.77]All these are, like, professional killstreaks on it.
[129:44.15]A factory new one is 18 bucks.
[129:50.26]Uh...
[129:55.29]I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna guess like somewhere around $10.
[129:59.94]Because everyone plays Spy apparently.
[130:04.78]Like $8 to $10 or some shit.
[130:08.44]I probably made back my money from opening these cases, which is crazy.
[130:13.45]That's never happened to me before.
[130:16.72]And I mean technically.
[130:17.81]I had a Diablo II phase when I was younger.
[130:20.07]I bought items.
[130:21.57]I was one of those kiddies for a brief while.
[130:23.67]I even did some work for D2Legit.com.
[130:27.60]Not really.
[130:27.98]It was kind of like...
[130:31.32]It's pro- it's pretty illegal that they're like forcing a child to work for below minimum wage.
[130:35.89]But, you know, I did it because I played a lot of Diablo.
[130:38.31]I- I was into that, and then we got some more stat tracks.
[130:41.45]Um... And I always justified it, that I was like, dude, once I'm done with Diablo II, I could sell these, and I'll totally make all my money back.
[130:48.34]It's like, it's an investment, I'm enjoying it for now, and I'll sell these when I'm done.
[130:51.08]Uh, I think what actually happened was my Diablo II account got stolen by my best friend in real life at the time.
[131:00.74]And I had stopped playing and I didn't even care.
[131:02.96]I was never going to sell them anyway.
[131:04.78]I was too lazy for that shit.
[131:15.07]We like shared an account.
[131:16.25]We stopped being friends.
[131:17.61]So the first thing you do when you stop being friends is someone has changed their Diablo password.
[131:23.31]That I remember.
[131:23.93]Like I just... I don't really play anymore.
[131:27.37]I was really into that for a while though.
[131:29.21]I... I...
[131:31.02]Diablo II is probably my most played game behind TF2.
[131:35.37]Either that or Medal of Honor.
[131:36.79]I don't know.
[131:38.27]I wish I could keep track of that.
[131:40.03]I don't think I have any more keys.
[131:42.67]I think I unboxed in the wrong order because I still have powerhouse cases.
[131:52.00]I'm just going to clean it up.
[131:56.38]Oh, it didn't give me the option to like... How many do I got?
[131:58.63]Just these two.
[132:01.35]I'll just clean it all up.
[132:03.66]102 cases.
[132:07.74]I'm probably gonna give that some melee too.
[132:11.42]That dude really likes the purple lightning.
[132:14.02]And he plays demo.
[132:14.88]I don't play demo.
[132:29.76]and uh more McDonald's shotguns so yeah all in all pretty pretty pretty good I want to go back and look at a couple of the ones here like factory new king of the jungle stat track what's that are they called stat track in this what are they called
[133:04.38]Searching the names of these is like... That's $6 there.
[133:10.30]If I were to sell it.
[133:11.16]That one I think we looked up, didn't we?
[133:13.10]No, that one was dumb.
[133:15.41]Factory new boomstick.
[133:19.23]I'm going to assume most of these are like $6 to $10.
[133:22.09]That seems to be about it.
[133:24.45]I already searched this one.
[133:25.57]Actually, that one is $13 there.
[133:26.53]$13.
[133:26.55]I absolutely made back...
[133:30.72]If I were to sell these things, which I totally am probably not, I'm probably going to give a decent amount of them to Tip of the Hats if they're interested.
[133:38.28]I guess I'll talk to one of them.
[133:39.76]Tip of the Hats charity event live stream for TF2 coming up September 19th.
[133:44.60]Stay tuned for that, man.
[133:47.28]And they do raffles for items and all that kind of stuff.
[133:49.34]So I'm probably just going to give a handful of these to them unless there's one in particular.
[133:53.42]Like, I like just got this pistol, man.
[133:56.68]I ain't ready to part with it.
[133:57.66]We're going to go play the game.
[134:01.12]We're gonna use the pistol, too.
[134:03.08]That's part of the HUD, just because the matchmaking is not there yet.
[134:07.56]It's partially in the game, if anyone was wondering about that.
[134:11.49]But it doesn't work.
[134:12.95]It's just part of the HUD early so that the HUD doesn't have to be updated later.
[134:17.09]That's a clickable thing.
[134:18.95]Doesn't work yet.
[134:22.85]What am I doing?
[134:23.51]I always do the wrong thing now.
[134:25.77]I was gonna go to my smaller server, and I guess people can join and be losers if they want.
[134:32.95]This is kind of hard to avoid people joining my games on my main account anyway.
[134:36.95]What's my smaller one?
[134:37.83]Is that it?
[134:42.48]That is it.
[134:42.94]I didn't even tell you guys the password.
[134:49.78]Once I make sure this server actually works.
[134:53.43]Then people can join.
[134:58.06]I'm in a good mood.
[134:59.24]You know, got an unusual pistol.
[135:02.12]It's cold.
[135:03.12]I like the cold.
[135:04.46]I got my air conditioner on in the other room even.
[135:07.16]Name of the HUD is Bud HUD.
[135:10.33]Bud HUD.
[135:11.49]Made by Whisker Biscuit.
[135:12.55]Also one of the people that helps run and organize Tip of the Hats.
[135:18.01]Good people.
[135:20.17]All good people.
[135:21.31]They help me out and customize it.
[135:24.33]And actually also helped two other people, like, have their versions of the HUD.
[135:30.06]Good dude.
[135:30.72]Good dude.
[135:31.46]Pretty good dude.
[135:34.08]Just have to get this off of MGE.
[135:35.56]Of course you're playing upward, you fuck.
[135:43.63]You kidding me?
[135:44.43]You are playing another map?
[135:57.07]Protect the server IP.
[136:00.23]YouTube streaming!
[136:00.97]Hey, jerma985 from youtube.com slash jerma985.
[136:04.43]I actually saw that comment in the sea of bullshit.
[136:08.32]Now people are gonna be like, oh, where's Jerma?
[136:10.14]Jerma, come hang out.
[136:11.24]Jerma, talk to Sean, bud.
[136:12.54]Jerma, go to the tip of the hats mumble.
[136:14.18]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[136:18.11]Jerma, join the server.
[136:19.89]How about that?
[136:20.81]Jerma, play a game with your friend for once in your miserable life.
[136:25.40]Stop using the I'm moved excuse.
[136:28.40]It's getting old.
[136:29.06]I'm going to have to move, and I'm going to use that excuse, and people are going to be hearing it for too long, and they're over it right now.
[136:38.81]Give me one second.
[136:39.47]I actually joined the server to pace the IP.
[136:49.02]Again make sure it works because I had some weird mods on here that I want to make sure it actually works on the normal server paste in the IP The password is LOL Anybody pop in here and join up
[137:10.18]Look at my pretty gun.
[137:13.18]For anybody joining, if you're just going to stare at me, try and high-five me, not play the video game, because I'm a play-in-the-video-game type of guy, you're probably going to get banned forever from the server.
[137:23.03]So, heads up on that one.
[137:26.53]And don't feel like, dude, you didn't warn me, I just want to high-five him.
[137:30.58]This is a play-the-game type of situation.
[137:35.80]Password is LOL.
[137:36.44]LOL.
[137:42.13]Still using the HUD that like doesn't show anything though, and it doesn't really matter right now Now Jerma just wanted attention
[138:06.98]Maybe that wasn't even the real Jerma.
[138:08.04]You could, like, fake people's names and shit.
[138:09.84]I thought Jerma was, like, a mod.
[138:11.59]I'm gonna assume it was a fake Jerma.
[138:14.33]Intip is weird about that.
[138:16.39]Like, people's names.
[138:22.42]Already full.
[138:24.42]Yeah, you can see a lot of people trying to get in there.
[138:27.47]It's a smaller server, too, because usually when I get, like, 24 people on one of these servers, it just turns into a mess.
[138:34.81]So I lowered this one down to 16 people in hopes they could be a little bit more organized.
[138:40.74]Who's that?
[138:41.76]Is that my good friend?
[138:46.68]Probably not.
[138:54.14]Frickin' fake.
[138:55.20]Phony.
[138:57.45]I don't know if you can join the server anymore.
[139:03.47]Where is everyone?
[139:24.70]Beep boop.
[139:25.70]Hey.
[139:26.40]Hey.
[139:28.08]I need to change my stream back to not be able to hear Skype noises.
[139:32.20]Yeah, how is, uh, how is YouTube streaming?
[139:36.33]Um, the chat's terrible.
[139:38.05]Much like when they introduced their new comment system.
[139:40.91]YouTube doesn't understand that, uh, anything, I'm guessing, about comments and chats.
[139:48.80]Is it still just, when I typed it in, it was like, it came in pretty quickly.
[139:54.72]Oh shit, dude!
[139:56.72]I just figured out why my streams have been so quiet.
[139:58.74]I just figured it out.
[140:01.16]I just figured it out all at once.
[140:02.86]No, chat's mostly been terrible, but otherwise it's smoother than Twitch.
[140:06.04]You got more people showing up because it just shows up in your sub feed.
[140:08.83]There's a lot of pros.
[140:14.67]I can play a video game with you, but I can't.
[140:16.71]I'm gonna have to just play Medic only.
[140:18.65]Why?
[140:19.73]Cause my, uh, my middle finger is all, uh, all messed up right now.
[140:26.16]You break it or sprain it or what's, what happened to your Tulsa Star?
[140:29.00]I like, I like slashed it with a fucking broken tile.
[140:33.02]Oh, oh, that's like, I thought you were gonna say like a box cutter.
[140:36.40]I was like, oh, nice clean cut.
[140:37.84]No, a tile.
[140:40.06]Yeah.
[140:40.42]Is anyone even on this?
[140:41.35]Like everyone is joining the server, but can't get in.
[140:43.75]The password is LOL.
[140:47.15]Is everyone just like getting wrong password?
[140:51.71]Or is it just taking people forever to, like, it's not like upwards a custom map over here.
[140:55.89]How do you just, like, take the password off?
[141:00.67]Should I?
[141:01.95]Let me get in.
[141:02.59]I want to make sure I get in.
[141:04.51]I'm going to be sitting there, like, auto-joining.
[141:06.45]Hurry up, dude!
[141:07.26]I only got, like, one hand.
[141:09.36]I can't.
[141:09.74]You're going to have to give me a little bit.
[141:11.44]You're freaking broken tiles over here.
[141:13.74]No, it's not.
[141:15.12]My hand is fine.
[141:15.78]It's just right where I click my right click...
[141:19.57]there's just like a slash down my middle finger.
[141:21.62]And it's like, ow!
[141:22.26]Whenever I touch it.
[141:27.62]Long story short, there's a little bit of work being done at my place.
[141:32.88]And I was like, I'm gonna move some stuff.
[141:35.23]Let me move this stuff for you guys.
[141:36.45]And there was a bunch of broken tile in it.
[141:38.01]And I like, when I picked it up.
[141:40.25]Okay, can you please join?
[141:42.23]And then I'm going to take off the password and change it now.
[141:45.21]People are having some troubles.
[141:48.21]There was the whole story.
[141:52.47]What is the, uh... You said, what is the passcode?
[141:56.57]Don't even tell me, I already got it.
[141:57.85]No, I don't.
[141:59.41]Server's full.
[142:00.44]Really?
[142:00.76]Like, why is it... I don't... Okay, I'm just taking off the password and changing the server.
[142:05.06]Yeah, try and do something with people for once.
[142:07.68]This is what happens.
[142:08.62]Complications, problems, people got issues, Jerma cuts his hand.
[142:13.37]Yeah, it was bad.
[142:14.27]I don't think I'm gonna do this again.
[142:16.01]And I was looking at it, I was like, oh my god, oh my god, blood!
[142:18.15]And I started getting really pale, and I had to run upstairs, and I was like, oh my god, somebody help me!
[142:24.25]No, I'm just kidding, it's fine.
[142:25.67]I was like, oh my god, it doesn't even hurt.
[142:27.15]Why does it say 16 out of 16 people are in here?
[142:29.62]Maybe we're flooding your server because there's too many people joining.
[142:33.53]You did just say that to like 7,000 people, you know.
[142:36.31]I did.
[142:37.23]You did just do that.
[142:41.42]You know, it might have something to do with the fact that you have 16 slots and 7,000 people all watching.
[142:46.62]Yeah, I mean, you guys are winning the lottery if you get in here.
[142:49.27]Let's be real.
[142:51.15]You see, I unboxed a $180 weapon.
[142:54.08]Did you?
[142:54.78]I unboxed a lot of good shit, like StatTrak, Purples, Factory News.
[142:59.16]This is the luckiest unboxing I have ever seen from any person.
[143:02.70]Did you get an Unusual?
[143:03.80]Yeah, the $180 pistol, Factory News.
[143:06.54]The thing that I have that I'm giving to Tip of the Hats, the Factory News Shell Shocker Strange, that thing's worth, at least the last time I checked, it was worth $150.
[143:15.47]That was the Rocket Launcher?
[143:17.77]Or the Sniper?
[143:19.09]Rocket Launcher.
[143:19.93]I don't know, there's probably been luckier, but that's without question, it felt like the luckiest unboxing I've ever had.
[143:26.32]Because like I was saying before I started, I've opened probably 400 crates in my TF2 lifetime, and I got one mediocre unusual hat.
[143:35.06]Yeah.
[143:37.16]So to get a factory new pistol... See, I opened up a bunch of cases recently and died.
[143:43.17]Hey.
[143:46.93]You're in here, right?
[143:48.49]Yeah, I'm in here now.
[143:51.98]Uh, I'm not in the server.
[143:53.08]That's a friendly reminder that if you try and high-five me, anyone, or you try and be a little punk, you Cloak and Dagger in a corner and only try and kill me, get out of here, buddy.
[144:04.98]Try to be a nice guy here.
[144:06.40]Hard to do in TF2.
[144:07.40]No one likes me.
[144:08.14]People want to take you down a notch.
[144:09.92]People don't think you're cool.
[144:10.64]You're like, oh, cool, nice pistol?
[144:12.25]Yeah, take this, and they shoot you on your way to, like, the ballgame.
[144:14.49]That happened to some dudes, right?
[144:18.11]My finger hurts.
[144:21.15]Uh, I'm not going to be able to join.
[144:24.35]Really?
[144:24.61]You couldn't get out?
[144:25.94]There's no way.
[144:27.40]I might as well just hang out and talk about, like, baseball, because you just brought it up.
[144:31.72]Can you believe Ghost Raiders, Josh?
[144:34.34]Can you believe it?
[144:36.60]They got David Ortiz, Big Papi.
[144:39.02]It's not easy, buddy.
[144:39.88]Yeah, it is.
[144:40.76]It's that simple, buddy.
[144:46.14]It's so annoying, too, because this was, like, the final thing.
[144:49.09]Like, it was over.
[144:49.83]Like, everyone was leaving.
[144:51.71]The, like, construction people, it was, like, closing.
[144:54.51]It was, like, oh, we're done.
[144:55.55]And, like, right when we're all, like, about to walk out the door, I, like, slash my hand.
[145:01.89]Why'd you do that?
[145:03.61]I was just trying to, like, help.
[145:07.58]I got everything in the boxes today.
[145:09.06]I'm all ready to go.
[145:09.92]I'm ready to go through that.
[145:13.25]Dude, I was saying earlier, this apartment is cleaner than it has ever been.
[145:17.29]Like, when I moved in, it wasn't this clean.
[145:18.79]It's crazy.
[145:19.47]I haven't seen... Yeah, make sure you don't leave anything.
[145:22.45]I'm leaving my microwave.
[145:23.97]I found so... Well, I mean, I'm talking, like, just trash.
[145:26.69]I found so many random fucking items that this guy had left behind.
[145:31.98]How many strangers?
[145:34.44]None.
[145:35.88]He just left a whole bunch of McDonald's shotguns for you?
[145:38.46]Yeah, he left like 60 McDonald's shotguns.
[145:41.43]I got a couple of those.
[145:42.75]Do you want them?
[145:43.19]Hey, Burgah Boy's an idiot.
[145:44.17]You know, in the box he threw at me, there was like four unusuals in there.
[145:46.63]What a moron.
[145:49.95]There's the lore of the video.
[145:52.32]I can't aim right now.
[145:53.44]People are playing this game.
[145:55.00]He just doesn't understand that those are expensive.
[145:58.66]Like, unaware pub world.
[146:05.08]I can't click on things.
[146:06.46]Probably for the best, too, because I probably would just be sitting there.
[146:13.11]Can you join off of, like, adding the IP?
[146:15.41]Because you should have, like, a reserve slot.
[146:16.91]I mean, if that even works right now.
[146:18.71]I mean, did you ever add me as a reserve slot for that server?
[146:21.89]Yeah, it's the same as the other one.
[146:23.79]Oh.
[146:25.38]Let's try that.
[146:26.98]Let's kick some poor loser out.
[146:28.36]I apologize to the person that's about to potentially... Okay, let's aim.
[146:32.70]Anyone want to aim this gun?
[146:38.66]Apparently not.
[146:41.02]I had no kills that life.
[146:43.74]I did so much... I can't finish dudes.
[146:48.14]That's my problem.
[146:49.88]I don't think you don't have it either set or it got knocked off or something.
[146:55.16]What is the best SMG I got?
[146:56.82]What do we got here?
[146:58.22]I have a new contract.
[147:00.28]This one was a stat tracker.
[147:04.19]Score points.
[147:06.39]Oh no, that scattergun isn't a killstreak scattergun.
[147:11.03]Game's pointless without him, man.
[147:13.23]I can score points.
[147:22.28]That aim, though, I know.
[147:23.46]I don't feel confident being sniper right now.
[147:26.04]Someone's gonna, like, really wanna come backstab me.
[147:31.94]We got no dudes up here.
[147:37.00]Yeah, we ain't got no dudes up here.
[147:41.02]Stream looks good.
[147:42.48]Yeah, people were saying it was way smoother than Twitch, and I'm not even... I'm still 30 FPS.
[147:47.19]Bitrate is 5,000.
[147:48.39]Twitch can only do 3,500.
[147:49.15]Is it worth the chat?
[147:52.53]I mean, the pros and the cons is, like, chat is awful.
[147:55.37]It's, like, impossible to even see what people are doing.
[147:56.74]You can't pop out the chat.
[147:57.64]You can't personally disable the chat.
[148:00.04]Like, even if you don't want to look at it, the best you can do is switch to, like, the details tab.
[148:06.92]jeez so it's a little awkward I mean but like the cert like the ingest is much better than Twitch like bringing in like like traffic like I like like actually like the data stream like you're getting much smoother stream and much smoother game that's what I'm hearing I obviously haven't been able to watch my own stream but
[148:23.53]You know what it might be?
[148:24.54]If the YouTube, like, streaming, really, the chat really sucks forever, it might be, like, worth just opening up, like, a chat room on your own.
[148:34.12]Like, an actual, like... Like, get an IRC chat, yeah.
[148:38.10]I have really a lot of faith that they're going to fix it within the next month.
[148:41.28]Yeah.
[148:42.80]Well, it looks, like, close enough.
[148:44.87]It looks like they're trying.
[148:45.87]It looks like it's getting there.
[148:47.77]I should not be sniper.
[148:48.69]Let's hope they actually pull it through.
[148:58.30]Well, while I wait, I'm gonna watch.
[149:00.32]Yeah, you do that.
[149:01.96]And watch muted.
[149:02.54]So I don't have to hear us all say the same thing.
[149:06.83]I'm not dead.
[149:12.27]This is like YouTube comments live.
[149:14.13]That's... That's not a good thing.
[149:18.95]Really, the only negative for me is the chat.
[149:21.41]Which... I think says a lot.
[149:22.85]Where are all these, like, emotes coming from?
[149:24.67]They have, like, the mobile emotes.
[149:25.97]Like, you have a phone with emotes in it that has those exact ones.
[149:32.32]Don't laugh.
[149:32.80]They're gonna do more if you laugh at them.
[149:34.54]No, I'm just saying, like, that's, like, funny and stupid that they have... Oh, you have, like, a mobile phone?
[149:39.54]Well, alright.
[149:40.82]Here are, like, the mobile phone emotes.
[149:43.75]The default ones.
[149:44.27]I'm not getting fucking anything.
[149:46.47]Oh, go for the sniper.
[149:47.53]That one's star over there.
[149:50.07]Is there even such thing as moderation?
[149:51.71]There is.
[149:54.39]You can add mods, but they're hopeless.
[150:01.54]It's an uphill battle for sure.
[150:04.40]I don't even know if he's here or not.
[150:06.32]Mute is probably losing his mind.
[150:10.16]He's seen all the spam.
[150:11.16]He's probably about to have a meltdown.
[150:15.47]I haven't even seen a mod talk in chat.
[150:18.49]Does it even pop up, like, does anything different pop up?
[150:20.69]They have a blue line next to them in the chat, and they have, like, a wrench next to their name.
[150:26.03]They'll notice if someone actually said something, but I think they all just, like, gave up and watched, and, like, they're probably talking in my Twitch chat right now.
[150:32.72]I actually bet it.
[150:35.48]That's probably where the real chat is.
[150:36.54]That's what I should have fucking open right now.
[150:40.70]Is that what?
[150:41.38]You're, like, Twitch chat?
[150:42.96]Yeah.
[150:43.81]Um, shout out to Burgtown, man.
[150:46.35]I love my Twitch chat community.
[150:51.21]All good peeps.
[150:59.35]Yeah, there's like all kinds of random things.
[151:02.65]What about, okay, what about just setting it up?
[151:04.13]Because I remember back when I streamed on YouTube, it was like, it was like the worst thing ever.
[151:10.55]Setting up a stream.
[151:13.13]It's like, it has all the options Twitch has.
[151:15.29]It's just like the same thing as like Twitch?
[151:17.07]Yeah.
[151:18.39]Because my goodness.
[151:19.43]It's really easy now.
[151:20.25]You can use OBS.
[151:21.91]Like, just imagine it's not awful and start from there.
[151:26.06]Okay, because did you ever do it on YouTube?
[151:29.16]No, because I knew it was awful.
[151:31.00]Oh, boy.
[151:31.88]Oh, boy.
[151:33.58]Oh, boy.
[151:34.28]What a big, bouncing baby boy.
[151:36.62]You had to set up a live event.
[151:39.90]You couldn't just be like, oh, I'm going to stream.
[151:41.98]To make an unlisted stream right now, if you want it to do that, you still have to do that.
[151:47.18]Oh, God.
[151:49.72]But to just do a public stream, it's just you click button, I'm streaming.
[151:52.78]Okay, because that was seriously... Actually, the offline screen and stuff as well, the way it live updates your offline image that you can set, the title of the stream and everything, it live updates it for everybody.
[152:07.09]Much, much, much more reliable than Twitch would do.
[152:09.73]This footage, I have it set up so this is automatically a private video once it's done.
[152:13.55]And what I'm going to do is make a public playlist of all my stream VODs.
[152:21.86]So they're not going to show up on my channel as a new video, but if you want to watch old streams, there's going to be a playlist people can go to.
[152:28.69]That's a really good idea.
[152:30.23]I think that can work that way.
[152:36.46]I'm bad.
[152:38.10]I haven't marked a card in, like, fucking a year.
[152:44.03]Oh, man.
[152:45.25]Alright, Medic.
[152:46.03]Here we go.
[152:47.01]Just left-click on people.
[152:48.31]That's all I have to do.
[152:52.52]You're in the game?
[152:53.70]Yeah.
[152:54.08]What team?
[152:54.62]I don't have names or anything.
[152:55.80]I am on your red team.
[152:57.44]Ooh!
[152:58.36]It looks like a bunch of people just, like, got dumped somehow.
[153:01.74]Because there's only 12 people in here.
[153:03.58]It's...
[153:05.97]I don't know.
[153:06.51]I don't really care.
[153:07.21]Game six on six.
[153:08.83]I don't really care.
[153:12.94]This has been a mess so far.
[153:14.62]I want to see your unusual.
[153:15.86]Show off your unusual.
[153:16.78]Have you shown it off yet?
[153:17.86]Yeah.
[153:18.68]I was playing it.
[153:19.24]I want to see it.
[153:20.10]It's a pistol.
[153:20.68]I'm not going to run around and pistol people.
[153:22.04]Everyone's trying their absolute hardest.
[153:24.08]I know, but we're just in spawn.
[153:25.56]I want to just look at it.
[153:27.44]We're going to lose while we're in spawn.
[153:30.85]Who are you?
[153:32.35]I'm the medic.
[153:33.23]There's two medics.
[153:34.47]I'm right here.
[153:36.63]Whoa, what?
[153:38.25]That actually is kind of cool.
[153:39.63]It's like a frosty pistol.
[153:42.47]Factory new, baby.
[153:43.99]It's factory new?
[153:44.91]Yeah.
[153:46.07]Oh, wow.
[153:46.57]Let me see it again.
[153:49.81]This is your sarcastic voice.
[153:52.03]Can you fucking cut it out, man?
[153:54.19]But that actually is pretty cool.
[153:56.43]That's really cool, actually.
[153:59.95]Oh, wow.
[154:00.49]Let me see.
[154:01.01]Oh, wow.
[154:02.31]I was like... No, I'm serious.
[154:03.89]That is like actually... I have the your voice mod on and your character in game is going, ooh.
[154:13.18]That was a better reaction to it.
[154:14.52]Yeah.
[154:15.58]I should have turned jiggly people back on.
[154:17.44]Are you ever going to take that off?
[154:19.08]Probably not.
[154:21.14]But that means I'm going to... That means like every time you record yourself or you play the scout, I'm just like going to be there.
[154:28.01]Yeah.
[154:29.92]Alright, well, get out here so I can crit you.
[154:34.46]It's your voice calling for you to medic me.
[154:39.76]That's really weird.
[154:43.34]Where are you?
[154:49.21]Are you out of farm?
[154:50.79]Yeah, I'm by the cart.
[154:52.63]I thought this medic killing me was you, because, again, no names.
[154:55.53]Oh, you're the guy.
[154:56.21]You ready?
[154:57.21]Yeah.
[154:58.17]Let me know when you want it.
[154:58.91]Go.
[155:01.91]Oh my god, I'm bad.
[155:04.95]I thought I hit him like three times.
[155:06.61]I was like right in the meat, man.
[155:09.01]I was in there.
[155:09.59]Bone zone, man.
[155:11.85]That's alright.
[155:13.15]We're good.
[155:14.59]Let us be the tryhard guys.
[155:16.01]Which one of these is this?
[155:18.81]I got a lot of factory new strangers as well.
[155:21.35]I can't tell which one is... This is fire over here.
[155:25.01]Oh, jeez.
[155:26.81]No!
[155:27.63]Don't follow me down here.
[155:30.65]It cuts it off on its own.
[155:33.29]Whatever.
[155:35.61]Oh, I got the wrong one.
[155:37.56]You dead?
[155:38.76]I dead.
[155:39.70]Okay, I'm the soldier man.
[155:40.98]I got the goldies.
[155:42.40]The other team only has five people on it.
[155:44.38]Is it really?
[155:44.80]It feels like there's way more.
[155:46.70]The server is just getting... It's practically getting DDoSed.
[155:51.68]Yeah, there's just so many... You know what you should just do?
[155:57.33]You should...
[156:00.00]I don't even know.
[156:00.68]I don't even know.
[156:02.80]I was just gonna try to pretend like I knew what to do, but I'm not gonna pretend like I know what to do.
[156:09.63]You're just gonna have to, like, find a server and just, like, join it, I think.
[156:14.25]Yeah, that's what I was gonna do.
[156:16.33]That's why I like playing with the no-name HUD and just doing my own thing.
[156:19.43]Going on alts.
[156:21.07]Because, like, I'm trying to play with people now, and it's broken.
[156:33.42]Because now, I think, right now... The server is not accepting any new people.
[156:38.38]It's just like... Yeah.
[156:40.02]We have seven people now, too.
[156:41.08]Alright, where are you?
[156:46.22]Load up those rockets.
[156:47.37]And let's go spawn camp.
[156:48.49]Alright, hold on.
[156:53.71]I need help.
[156:54.23]I'm not going yet.
[156:55.77]I don't have any rockets.
[157:00.30]Well... Uh...
[157:04.30]I mean... I mean... Alright!
[157:09.46]This is what we get to do right now!
[157:16.40]I mean... Here.
[157:18.01]Uh, by the way, just, somebody's on the cart right now.
[157:26.45]I wanna do the comeback for Boo real quick.
[157:29.67]I do the, do the, uh, do the comeback.
[157:34.71]What else requires one finger?
[157:37.65]Oh, who has my name?
[157:39.25]Medic.
[157:41.23]I'm just gonna play Pyro.
[157:44.35]Actually, Engineer, but Engineer requires, like, you... No, it doesn't really require the second finger, does it?
[157:52.46]If you, like, absolutely necessarily... Oh, boy.
[157:55.28]What was that?
[157:55.96]There we go.
[157:59.56]Does it matter?
[158:00.60]I'm gonna go win for the blue team real quick.
[158:05.44]You guys can try and stop it.
[158:06.58]It's kind of inevitable.
[158:14.59]Who gonna stop me?
[158:15.35]Haaa!
[158:17.47]Kanye West!
[158:22.65]Ugh.
[158:24.83]Is that you?
[158:25.27]Yep, I'm going.
[158:27.30]That's not even good.
[158:28.06]We could be SMG from across the map.
[158:31.88]Yeah.
[158:32.04]Well now you guys have seven and we have five.
[158:34.96]Okay, I'm like, I'm changing accounts.
[158:37.80]And I'm just gonna play a little bit more in, uh... I don't know.
[158:41.28]I, like, drank a full Red Bull and everything.
[158:43.52]I was ready to go today, so I could go for a while.
[158:45.52]I just... Whoa.
[158:49.00]Whoa.
[158:49.72]Let's do some stupid shit before I leave the server.
[158:52.68]You drank a full Red Bull?
[158:55.10]Oh, man, I usually don't.
[158:56.14]Slow down!
[158:56.88]You know me.
[159:00.80]Alright, what do you want to do in here?
[159:04.63]You wanna do something?
[159:07.13]What the fuck is happening?
[159:09.41]Why can I not switch my weapons anymore?
[159:14.01]Oh, okay.
[159:15.25]You're breaking everything.
[159:17.31]I understand.
[159:17.99]I'm ruining the server.
[159:21.59]Everybody has one.
[159:23.21]This guy thinks he's gonna heal me, but little does he know, um... Nothing can protect you.
[159:32.26]To clarify for everybody, they headshot.
[159:34.98]When you kill someone, it heals you.
[159:36.24]It overheals you.
[159:38.11]And you can never get ammo back for it.
[159:41.13]Like, I'm gonna shoot this and reload.
[159:42.43]It's 984 and you can't pick up ammo kits.
[159:44.67]So this guy who's spamming shots everywhere and thinks he's cool is gonna, like, not have any ammo when the gate's open.
[159:49.75]Potentially.
[159:50.93]I did bump it up to 1,000 ammo, though.
[159:53.93]This is counter-strike mode.
[159:55.27]Also laggy mode.
[159:56.87]My FPS has dropped so low.
[160:00.63]It's like I have bullet time.
[160:03.87]All I see is the streams.
[160:05.13]We're just building a fence.
[160:10.70]Oh my god.
[160:11.28]Do you want to peek that corner in Counter-Strike?
[160:15.08]Counter-Strike.
[160:16.90]They don't have a thousand rounds in Counter-Strike.
[160:22.84]There you go.
[160:26.93]Not all at once.
[160:28.45]Yeah, they do.
[160:30.25]Got him.
[160:35.12]Can't even get out of spawn.
[160:36.36]Yeah, you absolutely need to be... Oh, it's six on six, man.
[160:41.11]This is competitive.
[160:42.83]You guys waiting for a competitive matchmaking come out?
[160:44.67]Because this is what it's going to look like.
[160:45.81]Alright, well why am I fireball?
[160:47.23]I should be, like, heavy.
[160:50.73]It really doesn't help either way.
[160:53.81]I just like to play sniper because then you can actually have the weapon model work properly.
[160:58.28]Mmm...
[161:06.26]Only see us go if one bullet hits for two damage?
[161:08.37]Well, I'll have you know if they aren't headshots, they hit for about two damage.
[161:12.09]I mean, you just have a hundred of them.
[161:16.57]We're using the RCP 90 from Goldeneye.
[161:24.00]Except much better.
[161:25.76]Yeah, see, I just hit him for one.
[161:27.50]Let's not look over there.
[161:28.84]It's a little laggy.
[161:36.92]Ow.
[161:37.18]I was... I wasn't looking at chat.
[161:39.83]People are just saying poop in the big blue letters.
[161:45.51]Really?
[161:46.79]Alright.
[161:50.75]Why am I looking at chat?
[161:51.81]People are saying poop.
[162:05.75]Where'd that scout go?
[162:06.61]That weapon's trash.
[162:10.35]What were the other good ones?
[162:11.59]That guy blew up in midair.
[162:19.76]Ow.
[162:20.96]Nah.
[162:21.96]I can't remember what it was.
[162:23.56]Unless it was... One more try.
[162:33.60]So, uh, talking about moving and places, are you, uh... What's your status on it?
[162:41.43]Have you done anything yet, or are you doing that some more?
[162:43.61]Ah, I told you, I packed everything.
[162:45.25]Oh, you packed everything.
[162:54.46]Wait, where are these rockets coming from?
[162:55.90]Somebody's shooting, like, 100 rockets now?
[162:57.46]I'm special.
[162:58.12]They only do, like, 40 damage, I think.
[162:59.58]It's way worse than the SMG.
[163:03.01]What class is that?
[163:03.71]Is this a soldier?
[163:05.61]No, only I have it.
[163:06.71]I don't like you guys.
[163:07.37]What do you mean only you have it?
[163:09.18]Only I have it.
[163:10.24]Yeah, these do like 11 damage.
[163:12.36]I should give everyone this instead.
[163:14.02]Yeah.
[163:17.82]Okay.
[163:20.12]One more of these.
[163:28.72]Well, we gotta start fresh.
[163:30.12]The server is dead.
[163:31.68]You can't get someone to not use the SMG after you've permanently given SMGs to everyone.
[163:37.29]I'm going to Viaduct.
[163:41.95]Hey, Otto.
[163:42.21]What are you doing?
[163:46.21]Sleeping.
[163:46.53]Let's go.
[163:51.31]What team are you on?
[163:52.47]I'm on Blue.
[163:52.95]Does it matter what is going on here?
[163:54.49]Do you have to be a certain class to get this?
[164:11.11]Okay, this is what I did last time.
[164:12.23]I gave everyone this rocket launcher and I gave the other team the reflect flamethrower.
[164:16.89]Remember how you said your server is breaking?
[164:21.23]Yeah.
[164:22.54]Say sayonara to it because it's going to go down now.
[164:25.14]Why?
[164:25.34]Because of the rockets?
[164:26.80]Because there's going to be 12 people shooting like 500 rockets in every direction.
[164:31.54]I think this lags less than the SMGs, honestly.
[164:34.50]Really?
[164:38.68]Yeah, it's holding up fine.
[164:41.02]You say this every time, like TF2 is resilient with this kind of shit.
[164:45.97]These things do no damage.
[164:47.99]No, they do like 11.
[164:51.47]Man, I need Gunboats too, because you still take like full rocket jump damage.
[164:54.92]Yeah, I just realized that.
[164:56.44]I just murdered myself.
[165:05.94]I saw about a thousand more rockets than I saw players.
[165:18.87]They're going in.
[165:19.75]Can't stop me.
[165:22.07]What, you're gonna do 11 damage?
[165:24.83]Yeah, so are you.
[165:28.00]I had another version of this that shot flare guns as well, but they also did like 11, but they at least crit.
[165:36.65]I can't, I don't even know what's happening.
[165:38.54]I can't see.
[165:39.24]When there's this many people shooting in one spot, your screen just gets blocked.
[165:45.06]Got him!
[165:45.58]He didn't even hit me with one.
[165:50.32]Think you're smart?
[165:51.28]That was you on heavy, little one.
[165:52.76]Yeah.
[165:54.38]I know, you always think you're like the smart guy.
[165:55.96]Like, oh, I'm gonna go heavy.
[166:02.11]Get them.
[166:03.07]Get them.
[166:03.97]It's funny that everyone's going along with it.
[166:05.31]Usually there's one guy who figures out, wait a second, I can go Demoman and use stickies and actually kill people.
[166:11.83]Oh, it's not every single person, every weapon, every primary?
[166:15.21]No.
[166:15.91]It's just what you're currently doing.
[166:16.83]Well, no, because stickies are secondary.
[166:17.99]Secondaries aren't.
[166:19.31]Ah, that's right.
[166:21.58]Oh, well, then in that case.
[166:23.54]Okay, I have a good idea then.
[166:28.10]I dare you to try to kill me.
[166:34.15]Oh, do you have the shield on?
[166:35.73]I had the sandwich.
[166:37.18]I was just eating the sandwich.
[166:38.58]Oh no, if you go Demoman and you get the shield that reduces explosive damage.
[166:41.92]Oh yeah.
[166:42.42]I'm doing it.
[166:45.02]I just want to eat the sandwich in front in all the chaos.
[166:49.75]I'm not going to take any damage.
[166:51.57]Be unkillable.
[166:56.09]People are listening.
[166:56.79]They're all listening to us.
[167:01.25]Are they?
[167:04.19]Yeah, see, he killed himself on me.
[167:07.71]Oh, wow.
[167:08.69]Yeah, because you take more self-damage from shooting me in front of you than I take damage from you shooting him.
[167:19.89]Wow, way to ruin your own pub, dude.
[167:32.53]I didn't even have to swing.
[167:33.55]I'm done swinging.
[167:34.23]I'm beyond it.
[167:43.27]I could do this, or I could go do contracts.
[167:48.65]I got contract stuff to do, man.
[167:52.45]I got a contract to do, too.
[167:53.51]Let's go do a contract.
[167:54.43]No.
[167:55.51]What do you mean, no?
[167:57.46]You don't have an alt account.
[168:00.28]You're like way behind in the times.
[168:01.92]You don't understand how this works.
[168:02.82]So just get like a... Just go into like a server that's like 22 out of 24 and just send me the IP.
[168:10.39]What's so hard about that?
[168:11.77]Some people are going to join off you.
[168:21.47]So what?
[168:21.89]If it's a 23 out of 24 server, not more than one or two people would get in at any given time?
[168:26.57]No.
[168:27.25]Then it'd be like an actual game.
[168:28.73]No.
[168:31.59]You don't understand, man, because you don't stream ever.
[168:33.15]There's just no pleasing him.
[168:34.11]There's just no pleasing him.
[168:42.23]I don't want to make a new account, man.
[168:43.47]All my sweet items are on here.
[168:48.64]This gun makes it feel like this is Fistful of Frags.
[168:52.98]The shotgun I gave everyone that no one realizes they have.
[168:55.30]Oh, that thing?
[168:58.66]Yeah, this is just like Fistful of Frag shotguns.
[169:02.78]I like Pistol of Rags.
[169:04.32]Why don't you stream that?
[169:05.04]I don't like that game.
[169:08.04]Oh.
[169:08.16]I don't know why.
[169:09.20]Please.
[169:10.88]You had fun with it last time.
[169:11.82]What are you talking about?
[169:12.48]Eh, it was okay.
[169:15.51]We did, like, the competitive, like, matchmaking kind of mode.
[169:18.83]Anyone still play that?
[169:19.63]I have Booty Blast at you.
[169:22.53]Oh.
[169:23.35]Don't shoot my booty.
[169:27.91]Oh my god, that did a lot of three damages.
[169:33.46]How much damage does this shotgun do?
[169:34.60]I feel like it's doing a massive... Meant shot's like 400.
[169:38.86]Somehow that doesn't seem like it's very balanced.
[169:41.82]Balanced against what?
[169:42.91]Everyone having it?
[169:43.73]Why is it... Why do you have this?
[169:48.91]Why did you make this?
[169:52.33]It was designed for no spread being on.
[169:54.99]Because then the bullets go everywhere.
[169:56.97]But bullet spread is like... Off.
[169:59.97]So they all go straight into the dude.
[170:03.05]I love the Demoman's, like, wood-ass mannequin hand when he's holding this.
[170:08.00]It's just like his fingers don't move, he's just like, fuckin' stone man.
[170:13.08]This is the hitscan Huntsman.
[170:20.55]It's impossible to use.
[170:21.77]Hit.
[170:23.45]Do it again?
[170:24.83]How do I get it?
[170:25.31]You have to die.
[170:29.99]Impossible to use as he shoots me in the face.
[170:32.01]Well, your movement is like that of a child, so come on.
[170:37.53]I can't believe I just heard that.
[170:40.25]You ever seen this guy move?
[170:41.67]You see him on the dance floor?
[170:42.94]Everyone could hit him with an arrow.
[170:45.10]People up in the rafters, easy.
[170:47.08]Got that angle.
[170:48.14]How can you even tell what's happening when you shoot this weapon?
[170:52.38]What do you mean?
[170:52.98]It just instantly hits.
[170:55.14]It's just a hit scan, that's it.
[170:56.72]Yeah, there's no arrow.
[171:02.42]Shotgun is much better.
[171:04.44]I'm reloading a bow and arrow.
[171:08.33]It's too... Okay, please, before you do go, go demo with this.
[171:13.67]I was.
[171:14.17]It was just a crinkled thing in my hand.
[171:17.19]Just hold it down for a long time.
[171:18.53]He goes like... He cocks it.
[171:22.59]That's so dumb.
[171:29.10]Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you with my bone arrow!
[171:32.18]I don't think there's any downside to holding it, too, because there's no arrow for it to go off-center.
[171:37.62]Yeah, it still hits straight.
[171:46.20]Yeah, I'm reloading this.
[171:48.93]I don't know what I'm doing with it anymore, actually.
[171:53.39]It's so silent now!
[171:55.29]Everything's so quiet!
[172:00.24]It is really hard to hit these.
[172:01.38]Because they don't have the gigantic Huntsman hitboxes.
[172:07.86]It's kind of fun to use, though.
[172:09.48]Yeah, it's like Valve could add a new weapon to the game and it wouldn't be in balance and it's fun.
[172:16.48]And it's different.
[172:17.74]And they added a bow to the game and it was a promo item.
[172:23.15]Compound bow.
[172:25.56]Was that a promo item?
[172:26.56]Yeah, that was for Thief.
[172:28.04]The great game Thief.
[172:29.48]Why do, like, all these shit games always get the promo items?
[172:31.87]I feel like a lot of the promo items are associated with... Like, we were looking at that game the Black Rose came from the other day.
[172:37.65]Mm-hmm.
[172:39.23]Which the Steam reviews were raving, wow!
[172:42.83]Learn, like, uninstall simulator.
[172:45.70]Whatever it is they say on there.
[172:48.50]Why, uh...
[172:50.70]When was the last actual TF2 promo on a game that was, like, kind of a big release or anything like that?
[172:57.43]Alien Isolation?
[172:59.89]Maybe.
[173:01.99]And then there was Koth King, which... I can't... That update had some cool items, though.
[173:10.68]Is that the item that brought the, um... Was that, like, the Triad Pack?
[173:15.28]Yeah, the Triad Pack.
[173:16.64]Guillotine.
[173:18.56]That stuff is cool.
[173:20.01]And then Shogun had a huge one.
[173:21.83]That was actually a decent game.
[173:24.63]Yeah, Shogun was a pretty big update, too.
[173:29.13]Some of the best updates are promo updates, but a lot of the promo items are... Like, if there's not an update completely around the promo... Well, Total War brought the kunai, right?
[173:41.42]The kunai... Did the Conqueror come from the Triad update, or did that come from the Total War update?
[173:48.13]I don't remember.
[173:49.19]It was the Kunai, definitely.
[173:50.89]Kunai, what else was it?
[173:52.31]I know there was a... Hapsatoichi, I think.
[173:53.83]Yeah, Hapsatoichi.
[173:55.87]And something else.
[173:56.45]I don't know, I'm leaving this server.
[173:58.30]Sorry.
[173:58.82]Sorry everyone, I had enough of that shit.
[174:00.88]Um, I'm gonna go on a different account and do some contracts again.
[174:05.16]Well, you know, you can't even tell me like a super secret what it is?
[174:09.20]No, because people are gonna follow you.
[174:12.45]Well then, I'll just watch.
[174:14.13]yeah just watch just enjoy it like I'm streaming like enjoy what I'm doing for once so I wonder so you're in the sub feed right now yeah you like go look on youtube sub feed so are you is it just like do you just as it's as if you uploaded a video like an hour ago it's like oh hey yeah this is but it's not as long as you're streaming you're always the first person on the link that's not true
[174:38.16]Really?
[174:38.96]I'm not there?
[174:39.96]You were like, no, no, you were like three or four down on the list.
[174:42.46]Were the other people also streaming?
[174:44.88]No.
[174:45.81]Really?
[174:46.89]No, it's like as if you uploaded a video like an hour ago.
[174:50.73]You were like three or four down.
[174:51.59]I was told it was always number one.
[174:54.01]Well, for me, you are not number one.
[174:57.17]Oh, what?
[174:57.83]I thought I was.
[174:58.79]Nope.
[174:59.01]Damn.
[175:00.26]I thought we were like, are we good?
[175:02.12]Yeah, we're good.
[175:04.26]We good, man?
[175:05.36]Yeah.
[175:06.97]I love your stream.
[175:08.77]Hold on.
[175:12.51]That's very to the point.
[175:13.67]Hold on.
[175:14.15]Yeah, it used to say changing servers, but now I like the more generic.
[175:17.31]Just hold on, dude.
[175:17.99]It's like, can you wait a second?
[175:19.05]You have some patience here, man.
[175:20.07]I'm going to play as Demoman in Sticky Kill.
[175:22.28]Man, I hate using the Sticky Launcher.
[175:26.22]The other one's a medic contract.
[175:31.16]I've had such bad contracts today.
[175:32.54]What do you have to do?
[175:37.89]When does Gunmetal end?
[175:38.85]Isn't that like at some point in the next... Is it September... Mid-September or late September?
[175:44.81]I would guess late September.
[175:46.33]I haven't been keeping track, though.
[175:47.57]I mean, when did the update come out?
[175:53.40]Look it up and then add three months to that.
[175:56.06]It's about a month ago.
[175:57.80]July?
[175:58.18]Let's see.
[176:01.24]Gun... Metal.
[176:06.91]Came out...
[176:09.38]On... Let's see.
[176:21.17]Fascinating.
[176:23.29]That'll... yeah.
[176:24.73]Back screen.
[176:35.77]Let's defend.
[176:36.49]Let's defend last.
[176:38.96]What do we have to do?
[176:39.94]July, uh... July 2nd, I believe.
[176:44.04]Yeah, July 2nd.
[176:45.24]He's got metal.
[176:46.72]So, it's been just about two... July, August, September 2nd would be the day?
[176:51.37]Really?
[176:52.27]July, August... No, June... July, August, September... Yeah, September, like, 3rd.
[176:59.10]Because it was July 3rd, August 3rd, September 3rd.
[177:02.08]Is that one... I don't know.
[177:04.99]it said it said maybe there wasn't a definitive date I wouldn't be surprised if it was pushed back into October but I wouldn't take that as any sort of like oh it's definitely that day in the update itself it said like give or take a few we don't know you know you feel me so you're in a good mood today
[177:35.83]I drank a whole bunch of Red Bull.
[177:37.61]That's what I said.
[177:39.23]So you should start drinking coffee then.
[177:42.75]No, today worked out pretty well.
[177:44.87]I had a good lunch.
[177:46.15]Like, I knew for the last week or two that I was going to stream today and the YouTube was coming out.
[177:50.48]Told you about it, you didn't care.
[177:52.04]You're not cool enough to stream on YouTube.
[177:55.92]Um... I didn't... Yeah, okay, fine.
[178:01.43]That's how you want to put it.
[178:13.34]That's the mean way you want to put it.
[178:15.93]What was I saying?
[178:16.95]Oh, yeah.
[178:19.17]I was saying you were being really nice.
[178:20.89]No, Jerma moved into his new place.
[178:22.47]He's doing a stream now.
[178:26.35]What do you think all the construction is doing downstairs?
[178:29.37]I'm going to have a super stream room.
[178:33.25]And I'm going to have a cool introduction and be like, yo, what's going on, guys?
[178:35.87]Welcome to the stream.
[178:39.31]We have winded down here a bit.
[178:40.65]I started off pretty happening.
[178:44.17]I'm gonna play, like, really cool indie music while I, like, get ready.
[178:48.45]I, um, I promised people I'd throw my chair if I got an unusual, so I did that.
[178:52.94]Now I'm tired.
[178:53.66]Did you do it on camera?
[178:55.66]No, I... Didn't do it on camera.
[178:57.72]How do we know you didn't just, like, bang your desk?
[179:00.68]There were some pretty convincing sound effects, I'm sure.
[179:07.74]I gotta order my huge, uh, life-size poster of Benjamin Franklin that's going right on the back wall.
[179:15.62]I got a Glue Man shirt.
[179:16.54]I'm gonna like pin to the wall.
[179:17.76]It's gonna be a nice little space.
[179:20.34]A nice little space?
[179:21.62]Yeah, it's gonna be a nice little space.
[179:22.74]I'm in a good mood too.
[179:23.58]Like we're both in good moods, yeah.
[179:24.82]I got all my packing done.
[179:25.92]Like my room's clean.
[179:27.89]I had a good lunch.
[179:29.01]I had a prosciutto panini.
[179:32.81]Prosciutto.
[179:33.69]You have to say it like a moron.
[179:35.41]The only way to do it, man.
[179:48.66]I'm waiting for someone to go on the cart so I can sticky debt and get points.
[179:51.06]You're not doing your contracts.
[179:52.14]I am.
[179:52.96]You need to speed contracts.
[179:54.12]I need to sticky kill his demo and kill people doing the objective.
[179:57.28]So I stickied the cart and no one's pushing it.
[179:59.26]What do you want from me?
[180:00.64]Oh, I have something really, really, really interesting to tell you.
[180:03.71]Not on camera.
[180:04.53]Not on stream.
[180:05.35]Oh, man.
[180:06.11]It's top secret stuff.
[180:07.09]It's something I want you to be in it.
[180:11.01]It's something that's going to blow your mind when I tell you.
[180:15.11]This is seriously going to blow your fucking mind when I tell you what I'm doing.
[180:19.43]I'm not kidding.
[180:20.13]Like, you have to be in this.
[180:22.47]Okay, we'll stop teasing everyone.
[180:25.27]It doesn't matter.
[180:26.17]It really doesn't matter.
[180:32.23]Wow, he wasn't doing the objective?
[180:33.89]I didn't get points for that?
[180:34.69]Right.
[180:38.77]See how it is.
[180:43.00]Just know.
[180:44.57]Just know that you're gonna be a part of something.
[180:47.41]Okay!
[180:47.91]Cool!
[180:48.11]Cool, let's not talk about whatever this isn't.
[180:49.85]It's gonna change your fucking life.
[180:51.89]It's gonna change your life.
[180:53.53]You understand?
[180:54.17]I'm over here trying to shoot sticky bombs.
[180:57.07]I'm the sticky... Like, what is the medic contract?
[180:59.45]I'd rather, like, kill people as a medic than sticky spam.
[181:09.02]How about I just play the game and not even give a shit?
[181:20.20]Rough life out here, man.
[181:21.88]Oh, that's, that's called playing the game.
[181:23.85]Why would, he scoped out blue, no.
[181:26.79]Back to demo, man.
[181:31.20]Alright, well, you're doing your thing.
[181:34.62]You're going.
[181:36.00]I came in, I said my hellos.
[181:37.20]Oh, bye already.
[181:37.94]Like, Jerma stopped by for 30 minutes.
[181:40.50]Well, you, like, banned me from playing.
[181:42.86]Sorry, guys.
[181:43.18]Stream's over.
[181:43.92]I have to go now.
[181:45.08]Oh, sorry, guys.
[181:46.10]I banned Jerma from playing the game because he won't use an alt account so you can't play with me.
[181:52.71]So none of you can, like, join me.
[181:54.63]I banned my friend from playing with me.
[181:56.89]Yeah.
[181:57.59]That's what he's really saying.
[182:01.35]Yeah?
[182:06.35]Yeah?
[182:08.23]Yeah?
[182:08.67]It's so hard to, like, make a new Steam account.
[182:11.61]I, I, I... Man.
[182:15.85]I hate stickies.
[182:17.01]I hate it.
[182:19.07]I hate it.
[182:19.65]Do you understand that I hate it?
[182:20.77]Are you gone?
[182:23.33]Did you just leave?
[182:23.93]Did you just leave me here?
[182:25.38]I don't think you did.
[182:25.92]No, I'm here.
[182:26.28]I'm here.
[182:26.54]I'm here.
[182:27.04]Okay, so tell us a story about how, um...
[182:31.17]How stupid you are.
[182:33.65]I'm sorry, that'll keep him here.
[182:36.35]Slashed my finger on a bunch of broken tile.
[182:39.31]That's pretty dumb, right?
[182:41.01]Yeah.
[182:42.03]I mean, there you go.
[182:47.05]I want you to stay.
[182:47.87]Tell us how stupid you are.
[182:49.60]I can tell you how I'm smart, though.
[182:50.72]How are you smart?
[182:51.90]Just saved fucking 15% of my car insurance with pushing a goddamn Geico.
[182:56.24]Okay, he left.
[183:14.01]I just don't want to play Demo or Medic.
[183:16.67]Shit, why can't I hit you?
[183:17.59]It took a while, dude.
[183:27.21]Oh, dude, you know what came out today that I actually want to play?
[183:31.23]It's something, again, like I'd stream on Twitch over YouTube because I don't care or expect people to watch, care if people are going to watch or whatever.
[183:39.06]I might stream, like, tomorrow and do the Black Ops beta.
[183:42.76]I might be that guy.
[183:45.61]I actually want to play this one for some reason.
[183:47.29]Am I getting points for this?
[184:00.53]Man, Black Ops Beta came out today and I just, it's been like years since I played a Call of Duty.
[184:05.35]Sometimes you just want to play video games, you know what I mean?
[184:18.64]That's what I'm reduced to before Overwatch comes out.
[184:27.63]Yeah, 5,000 viewer Twitch stream, worse chat than a 10,000 viewer Twitch stream?
[184:34.09]There's no moderation tools at all.
[184:36.33]We know.
[184:36.81]We've talked about it.
[184:38.46]We get it figured out.
[184:42.20]I feel like Black Ops could be fun for a couple of days.
[184:45.94]Just freaking relax before I have to move.
[184:50.52]Play some dumb old click on guys slide around game.
[184:59.97]And then move on with my life.
[185:03.63]I need that practice.
[185:04.83]We're playing Soldier: 76.
[185:17.72]I think this is gonna be the last round, though.
[185:19.26]I've been streaming since 4... 4, 5... Is that... 3 hours now?
[185:26.40]I don't know.
[185:30.31]TF2 streams always end up being, like, 3 hours.
[185:33.31]Every time.
[185:33.87]Every time, like, at the 3 hour mark, it's like, wow, I've been... I've been gaming for a while.
[185:38.19]And yet... For some reason, Hearthstone lasted 11 hours.
[185:51.05]I just always feel like, shit.
[185:53.91]I've, like, set out what I set out to do in TF2 within three hours.
[185:57.03]It's like, yeah, it's just more pubs, man.
[186:03.04]That's how I feel.
[186:03.80]Let's take that.
[186:05.84]Why not?
[186:06.22]I don't have a Force Nature on this account.
[186:07.69]Maybe it'll be fun.
[186:08.41]Maybe it'll be exciting.
[186:24.66]Ten damage, eat that!
[186:28.54]You can just make that jump regularly.
[186:29.84]I'm gonna have to switch.
[186:34.11]This is the same thing from the beginning of the stream.
[186:35.81]Like, it just, it just feels like the same shit's happening.
[186:38.87]Oh, fuck.
[186:39.23]I might even have to go play, um... I have to go play something with people.
[186:44.52]I don't know if we got enough boys for that.
[186:46.44]Do you hear a truck truck?
[186:50.43]Say something in this chat and I probably won't notice it.
[186:53.47]You need me for the things.
[186:58.61]I'm going to assume no because most of the boys are in Europe for I-55.
[187:07.05]TF2 LAN event this weekend on twitch.tv.
[187:10.43]The best teams from North America and Europe all meeting up in the grand tournament to joust each other and see who's the best.
[187:21.41]That's not good.
[187:22.59]I need like bonk or something to get past this or to beat I'm gonna have to switch to demo and destroy this Because again, no one is going to Am I tired again?
[187:34.93]Yeah, lots of talking no breaks no vacation
[188:16.31]Are you here?
[188:16.87]I don't see you.
[188:24.25]Gaming is complicated.
[188:31.77]Yeah, next month again.
[188:33.13]I expect this to happen.
[188:39.26]Is anyone in the center over here?
[188:42.00]What am I hearing shooting?
[188:42.82]Can I get some heals?
[188:51.12]There's just soldiers everywhere!
[188:52.04]Can I get some heals?
[188:53.91]I think that someone got the sentries.
[189:12.00]Sorry about that.
[189:12.76]I mean, you probably wanted to use your sound box maker.
[189:15.86]Make some sound.
[189:27.01]I'd rather just pipe you.
[189:39.09]Screw it.
[189:39.53]I'm gonna play what I want to play.
[189:40.63]This is the last match and I'm gonna go for the night.
[189:43.45]Tomorrow's probably Black Ops on Twitch.
[189:47.61]Tomorrow is Thursday, right?
[189:52.31]I don't really have to panic... Oh my god.
[189:54.73]I don't have to panic about moving until... I think Saturday.
[189:59.65]I think Saturday is when I really need to be a panicked guy.
[190:02.17]Did I get any good weapons?
[190:08.81]Yeah, dude.
[190:10.31]Oh, it's not on this account.
[190:12.18]Yeah, I got a lot of good stuff.
[190:13.54]The bot will be available for this stream.
[190:16.32]Hopefully in a public playlist that's just gonna be titled, like, Past Streams.
[190:29.26]Watch whatever back if you want to.
[190:30.94]Dude, there's... What the fuck am I doing?
[190:33.74]Have I... What's my... What's my KD, dude?
[190:37.00]Not looking too keen right there, man.
[190:42.25]Why leave?
[190:42.87]Yeah, stay here forever.
[190:45.41]That's how the world works.
[190:46.47]Sometimes people leave and go to get a pack of cigarettes and never come back.
[191:07.34]Sometimes your health is red, even when it's full.
[191:09.18]It's just a thing that happens in Df2.
[191:15.46]I really need Bonk Atomic Clutch to get past this nonsense.
[191:19.51]Or be a Demoman.
[191:21.65]It's the... It's the eternal struggle.
[191:32.71]I don't know what you're doing back there, but you're back there.
[191:50.37]That's all I got to say about that.
[192:00.05]That's why it's a three hour stream, because I feel like I said everything.
[192:04.00]And chat's awful, so that's not keeping me.
[192:06.76]I'm just, I just keep saying that.
[192:08.24]Like, we get it.
[192:09.22]Get it, dude.
[192:13.46]Why am I in here?
[192:17.30]Why did I... Where's the health around here?
[192:20.18]You know what?
[192:30.39]Let's figure out what's going on up here with this entry.
[192:41.46]No one ever suspects the heavy.
[192:45.26]It's a heavy taking a teleporter.
[192:51.30]A heavy who doesn't know how to play TF2.
[192:54.75]Just waiting around.
[193:00.87]No, he knows!
[193:04.81]It almost worked!
[193:09.56]I'm doing some role-playing, man.
[193:11.00]Okay, it's a Pyro.
[193:11.89]I have no idea how to play.
[193:15.61]He fucking... That's why I hate Spy.
[193:18.27]That's why I hate Spy.
[193:19.95]Like, every time I go to stab someone, they like... Like, jerk and turn around.
[193:24.17]It's like, oh, okay, that's not a backstab.
[193:27.36]That fucking dude who was standing completely still just had, like... A brief moment of clarity.
[193:35.38]I think... I think I'm gonna turn...
[193:40.06]No, I'm willing to bet there's a dude around here.
[194:00.79]I hate Spy.
[194:01.63]Why am I playing it?
[194:11.12]Just, like, shoot us one or two stickies up there as demo.
[194:15.24]Someone do it.
[194:16.00]I don't want it to end.
[194:16.88]I, like, wanna stop after this game, but I don't wanna end this way.
[194:36.36]Push it, push it, push it, push it.
[194:49.61]I did all I could do.
[194:51.19]I did everything I could do.
[194:52.33]Which wasn't much.
[194:55.13]But if that's it, then we're done.
[195:01.13]Okay.
[195:02.33]Alright.
[195:03.17]Okay.
[195:03.57]You know.
[195:04.27]I understand.
[195:04.81]It was an awkward day of TF2.
[195:08.09]We unboxed a lot of good shit.
[195:09.91]We tested out YouTube live streaming.
[195:11.67]That's the recap.
[195:12.91]We broadcasted on an FM network.
[195:15.69]That's not true.
[195:16.41]That's cool.
[195:17.45]But I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[195:20.38]I hope, um... I mean, I'd have to imagine the people who spam in chat are really enjoying spamming in the chat.
[195:27.07]Like, it's just... I imagine you're getting something out of it, so I hope you had fun.
[195:32.45]And... I don't know.
[195:34.73]Take what I learned from today, and apply it to probably something.
[195:38.85]Bye, everybody.
[196:17.68]Someone's attacking-
