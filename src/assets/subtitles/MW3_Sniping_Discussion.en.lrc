[00:01.47]Hey what is going on everybody, Jerma here with a Modern Warfare 3 gameplay commentary.
[00:06.61]This is not the commentary I'm talking about though, this is just a small clip explaining I guess in perfect detail why there has to be dedicated servers in these types of games.
[00:19.99]You'll see what happens within 2 minutes.
[00:22.19]This is the best Call of Duty gameplay I've ever recorded.
[00:26.39]If you know me, if you know this channel, you know that I'm not the best Call of Duty player in the world.
[00:31.21]I don't try to be, I don't say that I am, but this gameplay is the first one I ever got to my Reaper.
[00:38.26]Nine kills in a row, nine point streak, and it felt really, really good.
[00:43.12]The unfortunate thing is I couldn't use it.
[00:47.02]I'm not gonna get into Jerma rage mode right now because I already did that I've been there done that I was already freaking out about this earlier so exactly what's going on right here I have the care package the predator missile and I'm about to get the Reaper and when I get the Reaper in my brain I was like yes I'm gonna get like a 50 kill game right here this is gonna be awesome plus I have whatever's in that care package so I'm thinking I'm sitting pretty right now I was so happy about this
[01:15.03]There it is.
[01:15.59]Got the Reaper.
[01:16.47]Eight points in a row.
[01:17.75]So awesome.
[01:18.37]Really happy about it.
[01:19.63]Come out here, get this one last guy, and then his buddy gets me with a shot in the face.
[01:24.05]Nine kills, one death is where I'm sitting right now.
[01:27.54]I don't care, though.
[01:28.34]I'm ready to use all these killstreaks, so I throw down the care package.
[01:32.44]Waiting for the care package, gonna sit here, pull out the predator missile, drop this on two guys' heads, so now we're up to 11 and 1 right now.
[01:40.88]Care package drops down and look what's in it, it's an assault drone.
[01:45.22]So, oh wait, that's right, the host just died.
[01:48.64]And I went to the connecting screen, and then back to the main menu, and the gameplay is ruined.
[01:55.85]Oh well, right?
[01:58.73]Hey, maybe I'll get it some other time.
[02:00.43]Probably not, though.
[02:02.15]So, moving on to the next portion of this video, I want to talk about sniping.
[02:07.05]I want to forget about all that crap that just happened, and I want to talk about sniping.
[02:11.41]So what do I want to talk about?
[02:12.99]Well, first and foremost is I suck at it, and I need some tips.
[02:17.43]So if you can give me some tips in the comments, I want to learn how to play sniper.
[02:21.54]If I'm using the wrong sniper rifle for a certain playstyle, if you can tell, Jerma, you probably shouldn't be using the MSR, you should probably use the scout sniper, or you should use this one or that one, give me some tips, I really do need them.
[02:34.79]And I want to talk about a couple of things.
[02:37.23]sniping in this game is pretty difficult especially when you're doing a free-for-all or a domination or some mode where people can spawn kind of all over the place because sniping in most other games is very you sit down you wait for people to come into your sights and you shoot them but I found in this particular game it's kind of hard to do that because you'll be sitting in one spot and a lot of people really really get really mad about camping in this game which it's understandable because I get mad at them too
[03:06.55]So trying to balance the, I don't want to camp, but I can't really move around because I can't really quickscope.
[03:12.52]So I'm trying to figure that out, getting new to the whole thing.
[03:15.44]This, I don't have any unlockables for this rifle.
[03:17.80]I just kind of picked it up, started recording, and just said I'm going to do it.
[03:20.77]I'm just going to go for it.
[03:22.49]So talking about perks now, I don't know what to use.
[03:25.77]I have Overkill on right now.
[03:27.31]I wasn't sure if that was totally necessary, but in a situation like this you'll see right here.
[03:31.88]Don't know why that didn't register, so I pull out the secondary, which is actually a primary.
[03:36.32]Get a two-piece right there.
[03:37.96]Pretty cool, but I probably could have just done the same thing with one of the secondary machine guns.
[03:43.25]I'll end up probably taking that off at some point.
[03:45.39]Just wanted to try it out.
[03:47.15]Camping.
[03:47.69]Now I want to talk about camping.
[03:48.83]I want to touch on it for a second or two here.
[03:51.25]When you have a sniper rifle, what is actually considered camping?
[03:55.90]Is standing in the same spot, or are you lying down in the same area for more than 30 seconds?
[04:00.52]Is this considered camping, what I'm doing right now?
[04:03.04]Because for the most part, I don't really see too many snipers.
[04:06.32]It's really kind of rare.
[04:07.82]Most people are running around with FMGs, Type 95s.
[04:10.90]So I'm wondering, is what I'm doing right here, is this camping?
[04:14.82]Now, I know I'll probably get a thousand different answers to that question, but I just want to get the community involved, get you guys talking about it, find out what your perspectives are in regards to mine.
[04:24.43]You know, I just want to get you guys talking.
[04:26.29]I like that.
[04:27.37]I'm a big talker.
[04:30.17]So this is going to be the end of the gameplay coming up here.
[04:33.24]Nothing really exciting happens, don't worry.
[04:35.44]I actually just get myself killed, like, I think, two more times.
[04:38.82]But like I said previously a couple minutes ago, if you have any sniper tips or any suggestions, I would love to hear them.
[04:46.09]Trying to get a little better at Modern Warfare 3 as a sniper.
[04:49.59]Oh, and by the way, I had jury duty today, and I sat in a room for five hours.
[04:56.17]I didn't get called into the jury, and nothing happened.
[04:59.02]I was sitting in the waiting room for five hours.
[05:01.92]That's a guess what happens.
[05:03.84]Oh, my God.
[05:05.04]My brain was going to explode.
[05:07.18]It was ridiculous.
[05:08.48]Thank God I brought a little game to play.
[05:11.53]Because if I didn't do that, I would have died.
[05:14.11]So, thank you so much for watching, guys.
[05:16.41]I really do appreciate it.
[05:17.65]If you like this video, go ahead and shoot me a like.
[05:19.98]And I will see you guys all next time.
[05:22.36]Take care, everybody.
