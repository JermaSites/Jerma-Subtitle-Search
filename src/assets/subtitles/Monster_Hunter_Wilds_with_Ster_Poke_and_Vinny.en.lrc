[ve:61.1.100]

[00:34.14]what's happening everybody welcome to another live stream it's currently 10 30 in the morning west 11. gonna be playing Monster Hunter wilds with uh with the boys four horsemen
[01:11.91]I did check in on the four horsemen I think they're doing the tutorial I'm ready to go I'm gonna just practice with a different weapon because uh Ster stole my fit I specifically said I wanted to go lance in the um in the four horsemen chat and he's doing lance so I'm gonna have to go bow
[01:48.59]But yeah, let's let's hop over here.
[01:50.44]I'm in the game already.
[01:51.20]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[01:52.24]I think Ster and Vinny are still just about to finish the tutorial.
[01:58.34]And then they can join my game that I have open.
[02:03.91]Let's see, here we go.
[02:08.19]Not going to really do ads today.
[02:09.77]Just going to get right into it.
[02:12.32]Co-op streams like this is kind of hard to do so.
[02:16.24]No ads, there'll be pre-rolls today.
[02:17.68]I might turn them off, might do one a couple times when we take breaks, but... No ads today.
[02:26.01]Or at least mid-rolls is what I mean.
[02:32.07]Alright, so help me out here.
[02:33.63]A bow is fun, but I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[02:40.04]Give me a hand here.
[02:45.29]By the way, let's go over the character because that's important too.
[02:51.03]How do I get a good view?
[02:55.93]Do sword and shield, bro?
[03:03.05]I know he looks like Captain Hook.
[03:04.59]It's an old Captain Hook.
[03:07.61]It's when they inevitably reboot Captain Hook.
[03:10.49]And they make Captain Hook... Well, they'll do a sequel.
[03:13.03]And he'll be in his 70s now.
[03:21.90]I've never used... Okay, I've never played with the bow in Monster Hunter.
[03:25.04]I was always a... This is kind of loud.
[03:28.04]I gotta turn that down.
[03:28.74]Let's turn that down.
[03:36.93]What would that be?
[03:37.45]That would be an audio settings, right?
[03:38.93]I already turned it down a lot.
[03:47.24]That is loud.
[03:49.32]Is that better?
[03:55.98]Now it's like it's coming from a different room.
[03:59.88]Little bit louder.
[04:07.77]Maybe a tad louder.
[04:10.71]Start with an easier weapon.
[04:13.67]Um... I don't know.
[04:16.37]I'll get used to it.
[04:19.81]You go like this.
[04:21.45]And then you get the dragon shot.
[04:25.35]You can dash around too, right?
[04:27.05]You can sprint and jump with the bow.
[04:31.23]Let me get it out.
[04:32.49]I thought that was Ster or something.
[04:33.91]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[04:37.92]Yeah, but you can put the tracers too.
[04:40.12]You go like this.
[04:42.58]Drop like two or three on the same monster.
[04:45.76]And then you can just like homing all the way over there.
[04:49.69]Watch this.
[04:50.19]Boom.
[04:52.11]Pretty cool.
[04:54.03]You can also do... I can also do this too.
[04:56.39]Just like a big spread shot.
[05:00.32]How do I do the... Not that.
[05:08.03]Not that.
[05:10.19]How do you do the volley thing?
[05:15.63]Where you shoot him in the air and you drop like an AOE?
[05:18.05]Like World of Warcraft?
[05:20.22]It's circle.
[05:27.40]Aim and then hold circle.
[05:32.72]Oh, I see.
[05:33.42]Okay.
[05:34.48]Is that you can go boom.
[05:38.50]Whatever.
[05:39.02]I'm going to say boom and shit.
[05:40.24]Alright.
[05:40.86]Here's the thing.
[05:41.60]How do I do this?
[05:43.88]Oh, look at that.
[05:46.30]Should I call?
[05:49.45]Are we ready for a call?
[05:54.03]Let's get a call going here.
[06:02.60]Hello.
[06:03.12]Oh no.
[06:04.24]What's up?
[06:05.48]I'm so confused.
[06:07.56]Why are you confused?
[06:08.22]Because I've never monster hunted and I thought I had two hours, but the time was in Eastern.
[06:16.21]Oh, Ster.
[06:18.17]You gotta use New Jersey time.
[06:21.25]I don't know why we're using New Jersey time.
[06:23.13]Jerma doesn't respect New Jersey.
[06:24.52]He's on the other side of the continent.
[06:27.24]Me and Poke are in Texas.
[06:29.54]And he bows to you.
[06:32.90]No, he doesn't.
[06:33.94]He bends the knee.
[06:35.08]Based.
[06:38.24]Oh, my God.
[06:39.55]Hey, guys, listen.
[06:40.63]Listen, before we begin, I want to let you know I'm drinking a frost chill sickle from Arizona.
[06:47.45]Ooh.
[06:47.87]And it's like, you know those, like, the three-color popsicles?
[06:53.35]Oh, yeah, those things are amazing.
[06:55.27]This is terrible.
[06:56.85]Ooh.
[06:58.86]Yeah.
[06:59.72]No good?
[07:01.02]I don't think it's that good, man.
[07:03.65]I don't like it.
[07:07.75]I'm drinking a bush light.
[07:11.68]At... 11 AM?
[07:14.12]Oh shit, I can't say that right now.
[07:18.30]That's fine.
[07:19.06]He said it.
[07:21.48]Oh fuck.
[07:23.70]I forgot it's not like 5.
[07:24.96]I usually start my stream late.
[07:29.15]Are you on the East Coast secretly?
[07:32.39]He's in New Jersey.
[07:35.69]uh sometimes you just want to crack open a bush light if you were if you were in New Jersey right now what would be the first thing you do get a slice of pizza from literally just walk in a direction and get a piece of pizza yeah it's not wrong I was thinking the same thing but it was going to be like bagel a sub sandwich
[07:57.65]you know what get some good sandwiches but you don't have a Jersey Mike's where you guys are like that's pretty good I mean I do but I hate them because he's fake he's it's jersey he's in Texas what do you mean Jersey Mike off okay good point that's actually true yeah I don't know if it was a chain but I had a place called big wally's where I was and it it was good alright alright so I see that you went lance and I was about to have a rage moment yelling at you
[08:28.33]I'm not happy.
[08:29.21]I think someone in my chat said this game controls like an aircraft or something.
[08:35.51]You've never played Monster Hunter?
[08:37.51]No.
[08:38.19]Oh, my God.
[08:38.73]You're going to hate this.
[08:40.23]Yeah, I don't know how good.
[08:42.20]Wait, wait.
[08:42.44]The prerequisite to enjoying Monster Hunter is having played it before?
[08:46.66]Yes.
[08:47.54]I mean, it's okay.
[08:49.98]Yeah, okay.
[08:51.08]Ster, very important.
[08:52.20]Vinny, you can actually, Vinny, you take the floor here because you know a lot more than I do.
[08:58.06]um hey poke poke is this your first Monster Hunter or no kind of I remember a long time ago for a bit okay yeah world is good I enjoyed that um well I can take the floor for a minute and just say yeah this is a tough
[09:16.29]The games have become more accessible, but yeah, I mean, it's gonna be a little tough to it.
[09:21.45]Listen, I'm struggling, and I've been playing Monster Hunter for 15 years on and off, and I'm like jumping in.
[09:27.21]I'm like, what are the buttons?
[09:28.05]What do I do?
[09:28.69]So it's gonna be a tough day, but I'll get you guys through it.
[09:32.56]Jerma's got the skills too.
[09:34.60]I'm drinking a Frostzilla.
[09:36.74]What is this?
[09:37.62]Frost Chill Zickle.
[09:38.90]It tastes like shit.
[09:41.50]The cats look at me and my knees get weak.
[09:43.74]Is that normal?
[09:44.88]Is that a beer?
[09:47.14]Not funny.
[09:47.86]Yeah, I just... I'm having a bush light, whatever.
[09:52.68]Bush lights.
[09:54.50]Bush lights.
[09:55.34]What?
[09:57.55]Alright.
[09:57.77]I know a guy who... My friend Dizzy drinks bush lights, and he... He becomes a different person, so... I'm a little worried.
[10:05.15]What can we do to help him?
[10:07.09]I haven't had a fucking beer in probably, like, six years.
[10:10.21]Well, this is the time.
[10:15.71]I'm drinking a fruit punch.
[10:21.26]Are they giving you shit about the fake beer?
[10:23.38]It's alright.
[10:24.72]Yeah.
[10:26.56]Alright.
[10:27.26]Alright, so Vinny, here's the important thing about this, though.
[10:30.82]People that play this game for the first time, they play it like an action game and they flail around.
[10:35.23]Okay, if you're holding a direction and you swing, you're going to do like a dash.
[10:40.27]You need to not touch anything and do attacks, standing still a lot of the time, right?
[10:46.24]Yeah, there's a lot of dodging that has to be done.
[10:48.92]There's very deliberate attacks.
[10:51.40]Dodge a lot.
[10:52.12]Get the fuck out of the way of monsters.
[10:54.21]Don't get greedy with your attacks.
[10:55.61]That's like tip number one is just find an opening.
[10:59.91]Listen, the first couple of hunts are going to be kind of easy, so we'll be fine.
[11:04.07]But yeah, Jerma's right.
[11:05.03]You don't want to just keep playing this like Devil May Cry because it's not that.
[11:11.07]Okay.
[11:12.66]but uh yeah we'll have fun I think it'll be good and you'll get into the flow of the game but Ster you're definitely going to want to spend some time on your own playing this too so I mean there's like I have to like take a class yeah yes I thought we were just gonna have fun I'm gonna pick insect glaive oh boy buddy buddy buddy buddy don't do that just do great sword and you'll be good
[11:41.36]Or Hammer.
[11:41.98]Hammer and Greatsword are the two... But I'm not allowed to do... Why am I... What's wrong with Lance?
[11:47.72]It's just hard.
[11:48.64]It's just like a lot of combos, a lot of jumping around and... Don't you have like a little insect buddy that you throw out and shit too?
[11:54.20]No, no, no, no.
[11:55.12]The normal Lance.
[11:56.44]The spear.
[11:57.28]Oh, no.
[11:58.06]Lance is good.
[11:59.28]But you said you were going to scream at me.
[12:03.16]Because I picked it and then you said you're going to do dual welding.
[12:06.70]No, you didn't.
[12:07.90]Go look at the chat.
[12:10.08]Look at the title of my stream.
[12:12.16]I'm Hammer.
[12:13.13]What's the title of your stream?
[12:18.59]Sword and Shield is good, by the way.
[12:20.83]It's really, really good.
[12:22.31]It's gotten only better since the early games, so... No, everything is fun to play.
[12:26.77]Everything's good.
[12:27.81]Whatever you... You said what weapon, and I said Yiker's Spear, I guess.
[12:34.59]I thought you said I was thinking of ranged weapons, bow or hammer and great sword.
[12:40.51]You never said spear.
[12:42.21]You never said Lance.
[12:43.89]I know later you, you, you, you.
[12:50.17]You're real spite.
[12:50.95]Okay.
[12:51.15]So I'm not allowed to use it.
[12:52.39]What are you using?
[12:53.73]You could use it.
[12:54.25]I'm just fucking.
[12:55.03]No, you're Lansing.
[12:56.17]I don't want to step on your toes.
[12:57.55]No, no, no.
[12:57.85]I actually won't be good at it.
[12:58.79]I like suck at it.
[12:59.79]I would be, I'd be better with the bow.
[13:00.92]I'm happy with the bow.
[13:04.69]Wait, you're going bow?
[13:05.31]Bow is fun.
[13:06.05]I like bow.
[13:06.79]Poke, are you bow?
[13:08.21]No, no, I'm going hammer.
[13:09.75]Oh, okay, cool.
[13:10.67]Hammer's good.
[13:11.11]Okay.
[13:12.33]Then maybe, I don't know, I could try dual blades.
[13:15.47]Um, Jerma, I think I'm in your server, but I don't see you.
[13:17.95]I think you should stick to insect glaive.
[13:20.43]Sir.
[13:21.77]Yeah, me too.
[13:23.03]I just saw you a second ago, Vinny.
[13:27.10]Oh.
[13:27.38]Do I have to do the story and go to my training area, or I think I've unlocked online now?
[13:32.08]Did you kill one monster, Poke?
[13:34.02]Yeah.
[13:35.10]Okay, so when you're in the training area, you want to talk to Alma.
[13:40.63]She's got the red quest marker.
[13:42.97]She's like kind of by the exit.
[13:44.89]Yeah.
[13:45.19]Talk to her, and then you'll see open quest board.
[13:48.89]Oh.
[13:52.96]Yeah, I don't see you in here anymore.
[13:54.52]I'm here now.
[13:55.46]I'm in.
[13:56.06]I'm by Alma right now.
[13:57.48]That's weird.
[13:58.78]Yeah, I just saw you.
[13:59.62]Not anymore, though.
[14:00.48]There you are.
[14:00.90]It doesn't say you're like in the lobby.
[14:07.41]I don't see you, though, Jerm.
[14:08.83]You're like, invite to link party?
[14:11.37]And there's nobody here.
[14:12.87]Oh, you just materialized in front of my face.
[14:15.18]It says there's two people in the lobby, but you're apparently not one of them.
[14:20.50]I'm here.
[14:20.92]I see you.
[14:22.54]If you open up the party listing, be careful.
[14:24.62]It shows the ID.
[14:25.60]How do I invite you?
[14:30.36]I don't know, but I'm looking at you right now.
[14:31.96]It's really weird.
[14:33.08]I should be able to invite you from the lobby list.
[14:38.43]Use environmental link?
[14:39.87]What does that mean?
[14:43.49]Yeah, it screens dark on purpose.
[14:45.52]Environmental link?
[14:54.60]Environment link?
[14:56.44]I don't know what's going on.
[14:57.35]I'm very confused.
[15:00.19]link member what's up hope am I in your guys group in the lobby but I can't if uh when I open up to invite you guys to a when I look at the member list of this lobby oh I got it here we go alright uh don't don't show your screens I'll I'll take care of this alright it's it's just all the way to the left that's where it is oh I see
[15:30.33]Okay, so now we're just waiting for Ster.
[15:32.09]Oh, there you go.
[15:34.39]Invitation list.
[15:35.59]Can I be allotted the time to try one other weapon?
[15:38.67]I just got to this camp.
[15:39.69]I don't know if there's more I need to do.
[15:41.65]I think I declined your invite.
[15:43.45]I think we'll have time to try a lot of weapons while we're hanging out.
[15:47.45]No, wait, I got it.
[15:48.23]I mean, in the training.
[15:49.01]I just want to equip it real quick.
[15:51.13]We can just chill.
[15:51.69]We're good.
[15:53.17]I don't want to be the problem.
[15:54.99]No, you can take as much time as you want.
[15:57.06]It's alright.
[15:57.64]We'll make sure that you live so you can experiment.
[16:02.71]After a couple of martinis.
[16:06.29]I'm here.
[16:07.57]Got that natty ice.
[16:08.37]Hey, look at that.
[16:09.11]Alright.
[16:09.57]How do you guys look?
[16:10.34]Let's take a look.
[16:10.94]Let's do a character check.
[16:16.14]Should I take off my hat?
[16:16.96]Yeah, we should take the hats off.
[16:19.52]There is a way to do that, but I don't know if you can do that without going to your...
[16:23.66]camp this is this is the the most amount of menus I think in a game I've ever played yeah that sounds about right what about the Earth defense force you guys that gave me you made us play I remember that you play it you didn't like it I loved it
[16:50.04]The game we played once and then just never played it again.
[16:52.04]There's too many video games come out, man.
[16:54.30]It's just like too many things come out.
[16:56.44]Oh, I got my login bonus.
[17:05.24]Oh.
[17:07.39]So, Vinny, start correcting me the second I start saying things that are completely wrong.
[17:12.44]This game is all about... It's... You get a weapon, and then you carve scales or heads or tails, whatever, from monsters, and there's a gigantic upgrade tree for each one of these weapons, right?
[17:29.36]know we're in trouble when I'm the one being asked for advice but yes that's correct but I think that's correct yeah how do we see these weapon trees come follow me talk to this person here gemma alright and then you do manage equipment forge upgrade weapon click on the one you're using and you'll see the tree and then if you look you'll see for example your first one you likely need two iron ore to get the next upgrade
[17:59.27]Yep.
[18:00.35]Yeah.
[18:02.56]Now, you can also do upgrade list by using RB.
[18:05.80]That'll help you sort easily.
[18:08.70]Forge list as well.
[18:11.50]Then armor is a whole other thing, too.
[18:13.78]You're going to need lots of monster parts for armor, and armor obviously has different defense values, but the big thing with armor in Monster Hunter are the effects, the equipment skills.
[18:26.23]Oh, here.
[18:26.71]Look.
[18:27.19]Go to forge upgrade armor.
[18:30.42]yeah and then you press c on press rt twice and you'll see equipment skills wait rt I'm on a mouse keyboard oh uh let me see you can just click it where equipment info is click right so it's c twice oh yeah yeah yeah and you could probably mouse over those or uh let's see preview
[18:56.46]oh I see what you're saying this equipment skills those are very very important in Monster Hunter so I don't know how to see what they do that usually there's a way to do that one guy in my chat just one guy he said um he said this stuff won't matter for the next 100 hours uh armor is he wrong to a degree yeah no no he's not 100 wrong but I think you'll you'll probably be fine for a while he's right so he's yeah
[19:24.43]But I like this.
[19:25.25]I like this.
[19:25.75]I get it.
[19:26.43]How do I take off my fucking, like, cosmetics shit that I put on?
[19:31.33]Vinny, what do you want me to do with the one guy?
[19:32.95]I could get rid of him.
[19:33.99]You can kill him.
[19:35.33]Jerm, come to the tent where I am.
[19:38.15]If you guys want to fuck with cosmetics, come to the tent.
[19:41.43]I'm just dressed like fucking Captain Hook.
[19:43.95]I like it, but I want the glasses instead.
[19:46.89]Oh, there we go.
[19:47.39]Okay.
[19:48.35]So you want to do, yeah, change equipment.
[19:51.15]We want recovery speed maximum.
[19:53.02]change appearance it's the head icon yeah can I see what it does like what what each like divine blessing press r I believe so so on your on the mount on the keyboard press r um oh perfect there it is I see it so those are good to have early but your chat member is right like you're probably going to end up
[20:19.78]just kind of killing monsters comfortably for a while.
[20:23.56]The main task and challenge for you right this moment, and Ster, of course, is going to be just learning the flow of combat, and there's a lot of buttons and stuff, but it'll work out great.
[20:34.65]I think I'm good.
[20:35.27]I just came out of training.
[20:36.35]I think I'm content.
[20:39.45]I mean I mean stuff like this seems pretty important like geologists or I mean botanists one extra consumable per gather you know what I'm saying that's good early if you want to like go gather equipment uh items yeah it's not bad kind of like Dark Souls it you kind of just need to just throw yourself into the fire and do it um you'll learn all this stuff over like a thousand hours yeah
[21:06.37]alright well I mean I'm ready to go kill a monster if you guys want I apologize but I don't know how I got into this the group that you guys are in oh go talk to alma yeah alma is by the cliff that name scares me she's uh a fear yeah she matters she's alma matter why can't I go to on
[21:32.25]I fucked up something.
[21:33.19]Every time I try to put a new piece of gear on, I turn off my helmet.
[21:37.87]Yeah, how do I hide my helmet?
[21:38.87]This is a big deal.
[21:40.43]You just click on your default piece once.
[21:44.63]So you can do that with equipment.
[21:46.67]Edit.
[21:47.64]And, uh... Here, I'll help.
[21:49.80]Hang on.
[21:50.00]Let me just join.
[21:50.72]They're saying go to my tent.
[21:52.56]Equipment, yes.
[21:53.28]That's exactly the quest I'm on.
[21:57.88]If you just want to hide your helmet, I believe there's a way to do that.
[22:01.54]Um...
[22:02.57]yeah that's what I'm trying to do oh all headgear can be disabled in the settings I'm being told now by my chat hang on there we go okay thank god now I'm perfect now where is that option chat member option game settings
[22:34.42]Oh.
[22:36.52]Oh.
[22:36.80]This is really the most amount of... Game settings, page three out of... Is page three in game settings?
[22:41.55]Out of 10,000, yeah.
[22:45.25]Head armor visibility.
[22:47.31]Does it hide it for others, though?
[22:49.53]Let me see.
[22:51.17]Where are you, Poke?
[22:52.01]Oh, yeah, true.
[22:52.63]Okay, yeah, where are you?
[22:53.37]Coming to you.
[22:56.60]Ster, did you figure out how to talk to Alma yet?
[22:59.20]Yeah, I just... You now have access to lobbies.
[23:01.56]I just... Your head's still on.
[23:04.43]Yeah yours is too.
[23:06.00]Is mine still on?
[23:08.79]Yeah, to me it is at least.
[23:09.00]Oh. No, you don't.
[23:11.00]Oh no no Jerma, you just have on glasses.
[23:14.00]Oh nice okay - so here's what I did: I went into the tent and inside the tent...
[23:22.53]On the menu, that's change equipment appearance.
[23:27.07]It's... I unchecked the thing.
[23:31.47]Yeah.
[23:31.93]And then you can decide what you want to have there.
[23:35.01]There's a little... There's like an iPhone settings slider.
[23:43.94]And then you can select what you want, like if you want the head to actually show or not for the layer.
[23:57.24]Sterm, what's your status?
[24:03.23]You're really tailgating me.
[24:05.91]Sir, we can't play without you, bro.
[24:07.87]He's having a meltdown.
[24:09.89]I'm so ready to kill a monster, you have no idea.
[24:11.85]This is a very exciting day for me.
[24:13.03]I apologize.
[24:16.35]I'm like in the menu trying to figure it out.
[24:19.07]Okay.
[24:19.73]I'll help.
[24:20.25]I'll help.
[24:20.65]I got you.
[24:21.59]Okay.
[24:21.85]Really important.
[24:22.92]We forgot to mention this.
[24:24.48]What you pick for a weapon right now does not matter at all.
[24:27.84]It is like a zero.
[24:28.76]It's like getting the regular longsword drop from an enemy in fucking Undead Parish in Dark Souls.
[24:36.26]Like, this is just... It doesn't matter.
[24:39.12]You'll have a chance to get anything you want right now.
[24:44.69]So, um, yeah, so you want to talk to Alma?
[24:47.39]I'm in the post-join quest menu.
[24:49.92]You want to do lobby search, and then you want to do lobby ID search.
[24:56.70]Lobby search.
[24:57.88]Don't show that on screen.
[25:02.70]Lobby search.
[25:03.54]Lobby ID search.
[25:05.19]Lobby ID?
[25:05.57]Yeah, block out your screen, type that in.
[25:07.75]And then you type in G74.
[25:10.61]What are you saying that out loud for?
[25:14.67]What are you doing?
[25:17.59]It's the mind sickness.
[25:21.57]He misses New Jersey.
[25:22.55]He misses New Jersey.
[25:23.89]What is he doing?
[25:24.57]Jeremy.
[25:25.03]Jeremy?
[25:25.69]It's me.
[25:26.41]What's up?
[25:28.35]Dude, your character's cool.
[25:30.05]He's invisible.
[25:30.79]We have to get him linked up, I believe.
[25:33.41]Oh, yeah.
[25:33.91]I got him.
[25:35.05]I'll get him in.
[25:37.13]Let me change my cat's appearance.
[25:40.40]You look like...
[25:42.75]Dr. Robotnik, if he really turned his life around.
[25:50.37]There you are.
[25:52.57]There we go.
[25:55.01]If you guys are sick of your cats speaking English at you, let me know.
[25:57.93]I'll tell you how to get rid of that.
[25:59.40]It can just be meow.
[26:01.06]It's fun.
[26:02.02]Oh, how do I do that?
[26:03.46]Okay.
[26:03.80]Yeah, let's do it.
[26:04.88]Press start.
[26:06.00]Go to options.
[26:07.64]Go to audio all the way on the right.
[26:10.62]Scroll down, feline language, switch that to feline language.
[26:14.90]Oh, okay, thank you.
[26:16.24]Yeah, it's better.
[26:18.36]That was one of the first things my chat told me to do, actually.
[26:22.05]Same, I ignored it, though.
[26:23.63]See, I have the cat on as well.
[26:25.31]Alright, so talk to Alma.
[26:28.23]Are we ready to... I want to kill the chat so bad.
[26:33.72]Are you ready to go?
[26:34.96]I think, are we ready to do it?
[26:35.92]Are you guys ready just to go?
[26:36.96]I mean, it's going to be easy.
[26:38.48]Yeah, I'm down.
[26:38.94]We're going to have a great time.
[26:44.28]You can do it as many times as you want.
[26:46.03]You can grind the same enemy to get the right scales and... You guys look cool and I look so stupid.
[26:53.15]I'm gonna go back in my tent.
[26:55.41]You have to use a voucher to change your appearance.
[26:57.85]Wait, no.
[26:58.89]Okay, wait, this is one... It's like recommended lobby.
[27:02.79]I didn't have much time.
[27:05.50]I was worried.
[27:06.06]Okay, we're already in a lobby.
[27:08.22]You guys said the tutorial took two hours.
[27:09.94]You guys said the tutorial... You didn't say that.
[27:15.09]I said one to two hours, and I don't know how long.
[27:16.95]One to two hours?
[27:17.69]I'm out here freaking out.
[27:20.76]It does.
[27:21.44]It takes like an hour.
[27:22.40]I looked at your stream earlier, Poke.
[27:26.26]I saw you on the brightness settings for a good 20 minutes.
[27:29.86]I was worried.
[27:31.40]I thought if that took that long, we're never going to get the play.
[27:33.91]I was just changing them right now.
[27:36.49]Also.
[27:36.79]Alright.
[27:38.03]So completed assignment.
[27:40.69]So now are we good?
[27:44.08]Where's our new assignment?
[27:45.90]Do we all need to talk to her?
[27:48.18]Yeah, let's head out.
[27:49.16]I can't even talk to her.
[27:53.52]It says quest.
[27:54.98]I have to join.
[27:55.86]I'm ready to go.
[27:57.78]I told her let's head out.
[27:59.34]Yeah, let's head out.
[28:00.07]I hope we're on the same quest.
[28:03.73]I hope we're on the same quest.
[28:04.67]Thank you.
[28:05.92]I feel like they made this more confusing I think this part is single player because you guys just disappeared it might be we should see if we can scrounge any up yeah what's going on if it's honey you're after I know the perfect spot this is a story quest is it a story you're in the same link party you can do the quest most people don't know about the spot I'm taking you to but how do we get the guys in here
[28:32.28]stay here for now no I'll be back together when the hunt starts I've been told oh okay is your village far yeah make sure you're grabbing bugs and stuff and on the sacred we'll be there in no time they're fast alright
[28:53.76]Pick up herbs.
[28:54.48]There's a shitload of crafting in this game.
[28:57.04]Mining is really good.
[28:59.16]If you find an iron deposit, that's very useful for weapons.
[29:03.60]Wait, so we're only doing multiplayer in fights?
[29:09.12]Yeah, usually.
[29:09.94]I mean, most of the time it's just post a quest to go kill a monster together.
[29:14.52]I think we have to do this first.
[29:17.46]I think this is still tutorial 2.0.
[29:19.52]Yeah, I think so too.
[29:23.65]Someone said apparently this game is a mess on PC, such a shame.
[29:26.01]I mean, watch it for yourself.
[29:27.05]I haven't experienced any frame drops.
[29:28.89]See what you think.
[29:29.75]Apparently it's better with Nvidia than AMD, currently.
[29:32.93]But, yeah.
[29:34.14]It's okay on my end, so I mean, who knows?
[29:36.90]We have DLSS on too.
[29:38.66]Yeah, my mom got me a Dell.
[29:41.74]God damn it.
[29:42.40]Just spit on my screen.
[29:43.90]Thanks.
[29:44.16]Do you remember when that guy's life got like fucking ruined because he smoked weed?
[29:49.23]Oh, man.
[29:51.16]The dude you get in the Dell guy, it was fucking bullshit.
[29:54.50]That guy, what a rebel, criminal.
[30:05.78]Fuck.
[30:09.83]I'm observing the monsters, you guys?
[30:11.75]Yeah, me too.
[30:12.53]Remember when Jermut fucked up his whole life because he was drinking like a Bud Light in the morning?
[30:18.17]I think it was a bush but yeah it's pretty terrible same thing very bad influence a game of telephone though by the time I guess the 10th person he was like smoking a joint and like doing cocaine yeah yeah that's true incredible I've never heard of a karat what are you guys sipping on right now slipping on some xanax sipping on that lean I was I was telling Jerma I'm drinking this this like popsicle Arizona like fruit punch and it's really bad
[30:48.32]I don't like it at all poke I don't know why I did this to myself don't worry you sent me a party invitation and the only option was skip how do I even accept it also how does my dinosaur stop running dude dude you're getting a deal he sounds like jigsaw
[31:27.49]This is supposed to be Monster Hunter, not Safari.
[31:32.94]It's optional to observe the monsters.
[31:35.90]Jerma, when I was a kid, speaking of Safari, this is from Pokken Star 2, but Jerma.
[31:40.58]You really need to start telling us all the story.
[31:45.80]When I was a kid, I thought I was on a Safari in Africa.
[31:49.48]Like, I was convinced for years.
[31:51.10]It turns out I was just at the Safari in Six Flags.
[31:54.84]and I just I just didn't know any better because I was so young I was like man I don't remember the plane ride and then I was told later it was like no you were you were in six flags this is the spot so that's thank you it's so awesome over here be careful yeah was it honey and herbs make a healing potion right if I remember yeah yeah they make a good one that should be enough honey
[32:25.05]you like that flavor yeah actually yes please follow me I'm looting this game is kind of a slow burn I would say that but when you if you actually get into it it's one of the most fun just rpgs it's just fun to jump in and just kill stuff
[32:49.19]Yeah, you can lose, like, hours just in, like... Yeah, that's fine.
[32:53.87]What he said.
[32:54.98]Am I inventory full?
[32:57.12]I think you can only carry a certain amount of each thing, right?
[33:03.58]Um, yeah, when you're on a mission.
[33:05.10]And then you have to bring it to your pouch later.
[33:07.15]To the villagers, we're outsiders.
[33:11.05]I don't want to do anything to offend them.
[33:14.49]It'll be fine.
[33:15.51]Just play it cool.
[33:18.09]Oh, probably describe the whetstone.
[33:21.63]That's important for whoever has a weapon that's not a ranged weapon.
[33:25.87]Yeah, if you're using a blade, you want to... What about a hammer?
[33:32.82]Yeah, even a hammer you need to use a whetstone on for some reason.
[33:35.28]But if you hold LB, you'll see a little sword icon below your two meters.
[33:42.54]And that is your sharpness.
[33:45.45]So after a while, you have to...
[33:47.51]use your whetstone.
[33:48.57]And to do that, it's just LB and then up on the right stick.
[33:55.99]It's a way to make the game harder, right?
[33:58.05]You're doing this all the time, by the way.
[34:00.37]This is not, oh, you do it once before a pull, and then we do this for an hour.
[34:03.47]No, you're going to be doing it every... Anytime that that bar is dropped halfway, you should be doing it, and it happens all the time.
[34:11.43]Yeah, so be aware if you're not doing a lot of damage, you gotta sharpen your hammer.
[34:14.87]I gotta sharpen my shit.
[34:15.65]My character's voice.
[34:17.69]Okay.
[34:39.78]Turn my house, wow.
[34:41.76]It's fun.
[34:42.68]I'm level 18.
[34:45.96]You almost die yet?
[34:47.26]Oh, legal.
[34:48.36]Once.
[34:50.40]I almost died one time in the tower with North Watch Hold with all the pirate people are.
[34:57.75]Oh, shit.
[34:59.01]Did you get scared?
[34:59.83]Like, your heart rate?
[35:01.25]Yeah.
[35:01.99]My heart rate monitor I have was like 240, I think.
[35:05.43]Somebody said that was more than a rabbit, and I said, what?
[35:07.88]Huh?
[35:08.77]Wait, actually?
[35:09.43]40?
[35:10.23]Is that normal?
[35:11.85]What the hell?
[35:12.77]That's how many hurts my monitor has.
[35:14.54]That's not normal.
[35:23.88]Are you guys killing dinosaurs now?
[35:26.68]The Bulgachis.
[35:28.12]Yeah.
[35:29.06]The Bulgogi.
[35:30.23]Bulgogi.
[35:30.75]Do you like K-BBQ poke?
[35:34.94]authorization love it yeah how about you Ster see I'm including you guys I feel like you did that like out of pity like oh wait I forgot him again
[35:48.39]I don't forget.
[35:49.01]Yes, it's one of my favorite foods.
[35:51.83]That's nice, man.
[35:52.75]Wait, I know a really good I know a really good place.
[35:54.85]So you want to go?
[35:57.01]Uh, sure.
[35:58.11]Maybe I've been there.
[35:58.89]It's a lot.
[35:59.29]Oh, I'm killing the bugs, not the dinosaurs.
[36:00.93]A lot of the big streamer meetups were at a cream barbecue place.
[36:04.14]I am one of the one by H Mart.
[36:11.16]So good.
[36:14.74]I believe.
[36:16.68]Well, let's go.
[36:18.24]Right now.
[36:18.76]Screw this.
[36:19.40]How do I turn this power coding on?
[36:20.88]I believe you.
[36:21.44]I just feel like you don't believe me.
[36:24.70]That might be in the LB menu somewhere.
[36:26.72]I think LB and then the D-pad switch is different.
[36:29.58]Yeah, I'm ordering the Bulgogi off the LB menu.
[36:36.61]That's a sentence.
[36:38.54]See, I used to be a Bulgogi guy, but I feel like just beef.
[36:46.06]Alright, you can't say that.
[36:47.38]You know I have gout.
[36:48.32]Does beef affect the gout?
[36:52.16]Oh, my God.
[36:52.72]Everyone is so ignorant.
[36:54.10]What about the King Bulgogi?
[37:03.16]Ooh, that's a good move.
[37:10.07]every every time I hear my cat meow I feel like I'm being saved from something I don't even know of they are cats go away we're in a party right wait I made it home they used to okay maybe the next quest we'll be able to actually fight a monster together that would be sick hey where's this last one that was it yeah I'm back in town
[37:38.47]it won't let me like leave I didn't apparently use environmental link in the communication menu to see others in the open world wait what what does that mean
[38:09.49]We're environmentally linked.
[38:12.25]Yeah, we're in the same lobby and we're linked together, so we should be doing everything together when we can.
[38:17.59]When I completed this quest, they're telling me about squads, so that may have been a thing.
[38:23.77]Not in story missions, I'm being told.
[38:25.52]Wow, there's a lot of conflicting information.
[38:28.44]Game's only been out for like a couple hours, so whatever.
[38:31.18]Well, I finished the mission and it said you can form a squad now and we couldn't before, I guess.
[38:38.22]Sorry.
[38:40.25]Aflac?
[38:42.77]Aflac.
[38:43.59]Aflac!
[38:44.15]Alright, I don't know.
[38:45.93]I'm just trying to help.
[38:46.79]I like, no, it's help as much as you want.
[38:49.55]I didn't know you couldn't eat beef though.
[38:51.37]So what do you eat?
[38:52.13]Like, what do you eat in general?
[38:54.71]Can you have salami?
[38:56.05]Uh, it's any red meat and shrimp are very bad for it.
[39:02.94]I can eat it, but like, not, not in high doses, not regularly.
[39:08.80]No alcohol either?
[39:11.42]I already don't drink alcohol.
[39:13.66]Okay.
[39:14.74]I'm a loser.
[39:16.06]No, that's good.
[39:17.28]That's the winners do that.
[39:19.64]Yeah, I'm not with my bush in the morning.
[39:22.98]Do you smoke cigarettes?
[39:24.82]No.
[39:25.82]Fen?
[39:27.20]No, Fen.
[39:27.80]I feel like you need a cigarette Ster.
[39:33.17]I'm sipping on water.
[39:38.86]Poke, you should go to Star and give him cigarettes in real life.
[39:42.70]Poke, I was watching you watch that lady who was smoking the... What was her name?
[39:47.72]Teresa?
[39:48.50]She's awesome.
[39:50.24]Dude, she's made me want to go all out and spend all my money on vapes.
[39:54.81]On a geek bar?
[39:55.53]Yeah, just don't.
[39:56.55]She convinced me.
[39:57.39]No, I'm doing it for her.
[39:58.53]Doing it for Teresa.
[40:00.25]Yeah, I love her.
[40:00.99]Vapes.
[40:06.15]Jeremiah, you should watch... Oh, and Vinny, I guess.
[40:10.19]But you should look up Teresa.
[40:12.13]Just look up Teresa Geekbar on YouTube.
[40:16.45]Just watch her videos and you'll have a great... It's just great.
[40:20.27]I love how it's called Geekbar.
[40:21.91]Not now, though.
[40:22.83]Not now, though.
[40:23.31]I don't know.
[40:26.30]They're just geeking.
[40:28.74]Geeking out right now.
[40:30.42]Do I make this mystery... This bone hammer from Mystery Bone?
[40:36.62]you could if you like I made a bone uh sword it's a little bit better but the durability sucks so there's like a skill tree when you upgrade your weapons and it goes far that don't be deceived there's like a whole are those like active new buttons
[40:54.33]or like do they give you new attacks to do not new attacks but they have equipment skills they have different um properties attack damage affinities uh different sharpness levels so for example germo was saying you're gonna end up sharpening your sword or your weapon all the time that is true but some weapons uh getting sharpened less Vinny Vinny I was talking to Jerma
[41:19.44]Well, Vinny knew way more than I did, and that was a much better explanation than I would have given you, so... So, also, you're going to want to go to your tent, Jerma, and you're going to want to drop off your items.
[41:35.51]Oh, also, if you make a weapon, you have to go get it, right?
[41:39.19]It's not just equipped on top of you, it's just in your box now?
[41:42.38]You can equip it directly from the menu there, if you want.
[41:49.74]Perfection.
[41:51.76]Crafting material, Nullbury.
[41:54.06]Oh, they categorized all the items now.
[41:58.86]Alright, it's on there.
[42:04.16]Oh, barbecue spit.
[42:09.80]You can find more of this stuff.
[42:11.20]So... They're loaded with all kinds of goodies.
[42:14.98]We have no cell if you need.
[42:16.14]Yeah.
[42:19.14]no I I don't know I'm just gonna get used to being con like man people tell me like path of exile is hard to learn what I just just I'm infinite menus yeah I know yeah
[42:31.71]I'm still, I'm struggling too.
[42:33.37]I like, and I've played these games for awhile, but you, you know, okay.
[42:37.48]I can answer your questions the best of my ability.
[42:39.98]Did you get that invite Ster?
[42:41.40]It says they already sent you an invite.
[42:42.68]I'm able to join the session.
[42:46.00]You are currently in offline mode.
[42:50.10]The fuck offline mode.
[42:56.32]I don't know yeah I I press when I press escape start it says offline next to my points and my money at the top I don't know what happened I was muted do I talk to alma finish preparations and talk to alma um are we still linked I don't see each other in the lobby environmental link is different from link party okay what does that mean
[43:28.08]the lobby died the lobby died well do I should I re-invite everybody again I maybe but it still says I'm offline in the game wait we're linked together Jeremy and Vinny yeah we should be linked
[43:50.92]yeah I'm I'm in a yeah group with Jeremy and poke so Ster me you need to get in here um I'm trying to figure out why it says I'm offline should I like restart I don't know what to do let me see if I can go in here yeah my screen's dark uh black right now I need to do let me see if I can figure out if I can pull him in somehow yeah it says you poke and Vinny are both in link party you are not Ster I'm
[44:20.83]trying my best communication no are there bounty boards yeah usually it was a communication yeah just be careful it'll show if you go to like the party it'll show uh or like the any of the id menus it'll show the lobby
[44:51.65]Alma is the quest board.
[44:54.69]Yeah, if I go to Alma, I have access to a quest or an event, but I don't think I could do anything yet.
[45:04.99]Let me see what happens if I talk to her.
[45:06.97]She just starts a new quest.
[45:09.15]Okay, I restarted my game.
[45:10.75]It says I'm online, and I tried to join off the lobby link, and it worked, but I don't see anyone.
[45:16.02]Okay, so now I have to get you in.
[45:17.72]So hold on.
[45:20.24]you're still in the story quest the link people are talking about is for free roam huh why am I in a quest still we just finished one yeah mine now says finish prep and talk to alma do that just just do it okay get that invite and then now we do yeah I wonder
[45:49.01]They have not improved this system in seven years.
[45:51.83]You still don't have the chicken yet.
[45:55.15]You still have to do more of the tutorial.
[45:56.88]So we're not done.
[45:57.66]We thought we were ready for multiplayer, but we're not.
[46:00.68]Okay, I'm going to do the final preparation then.
[46:03.06]Do final preparation.
[46:04.08]I think we should all do it on our own.
[46:05.64]Yeah.
[46:08.22]It says, if you start an environment link, you can't start quests.
[46:11.25]Just be in link party to start quests together.
[46:13.67]I don't think we did environment link.
[46:16.07]I mean, they joined the... This is a private lobby, and then they were invited to link party.
[46:19.95]That's all we did.
[46:21.99]So, I think from what Johnny is telling me, my friend Johnny, there's... We got to do this quest.
[46:29.42]So, we just got to keep going.
[46:30.96]Yeah, we got to keep going.
[46:32.22]I wish I had a Johnny.
[46:33.42]A Johnny is useful to have.
[46:36.48]It's always good to have a Johnny.
[46:39.64]How do I put on this power coding?
[46:46.80]I don't get it.
[46:47.91]So just burn through these missions first.
[46:50.15]Do I have no mount?
[46:51.85]Yeah, I think we're being scammed on this quest.
[46:53.17]I think I went backwards.
[47:20.59]Scout fly?
[47:22.56]Why don't they just put the meat down?
[47:24.10]Oh shit, that hurt.
[47:27.98]Oh, poop on the ground.
[47:45.54]Puts the lotion in the basket Oh, it's a giant dog
[48:12.80]Oh, cool.
[48:13.42]This is a cool monster.
[48:14.76]It's a giant.
[48:15.30]Oh, well, I don't want to ruin it.
[48:31.68]Five FPS.
[48:34.50]What?
[48:35.30]Mine doesn't look like that for me.
[48:37.94]You guys have a laggy stream?
[48:40.28]No, mine's good.
[48:45.78]what why don't they just put the meat down I'm not dropping any frames at all yeah get on hurry oh I'm gonna die to this thing about it later no you have to follow you got this Ster I believe in you
[49:12.66]Thanks.
[49:12.94]I changed my weapon and I don't have a shield anymore.
[49:14.94]And I was.
[49:17.60]Were you relying on the shield?
[49:19.15]Yes.
[49:19.95]Oh, no.
[49:20.85]They sent me a quest invitation.
[49:22.41]Do I take that?
[49:24.25]I didn't send anything.
[49:27.05]I wouldn't.
[49:27.41]Don't trust it.
[49:27.97]I'm going to kill this guy first.
[49:31.19]How do you?
[49:31.93]Where's your stake?
[49:33.05]Bro, I don't even know how to heal.
[49:34.19]I feel like I'm half dead already.
[49:39.28]You heal with LB.
[49:41.28]And it's in the radial menu.
[49:42.36]It's L, B, right, stick, left.
[49:44.62]Ah, shit.
[49:45.58]Radial menu.
[49:47.00]Optimal healing.
[49:48.41]I don't know what the radial menu is.
[49:50.75]You can join others now?
[49:53.61]What do you mean?
[49:54.23]How?
[49:56.47]Dude, why does my stream suck so bad?
[50:00.86]You can sync up.
[50:03.78]Well, I'm fighting a monster.
[50:05.08]I'm kind of a little busy.
[50:09.59]These story missions, you can join others once the combat starts.
[50:19.74]I want to help Ster.
[50:22.26]How do I?
[50:23.24]There's no join.
[50:24.50]I have to just skip.
[50:26.08]I think I'm joining Jerma.
[50:29.64]Yeah, Jerma sent me an invite and I was able to join it, I think.
[50:34.00]Jerma, can you send me one?
[50:36.33]uh I sent you an invite what button is that on PlayStation I sent an invite what did I even do you're on invited to quest oh this game invitation list quest invite Jeremy I think there's auto sending them because we're in the group oh you're in okay you're here now yeah
[51:03.30]How do you use a heal?
[51:03.82]You guys don't finish this individually.
[51:05.26]You're going to have to do it all alone again.
[51:07.92]Are you kidding me?
[51:09.82]That's what I had heard.
[51:10.72]That's what I was trying to point out.
[51:12.78]I had heard some very sus things.
[51:15.83]Oh, I got it.
[51:20.49]Is this true?
[51:20.97]I mean, I'm also getting conflicting information, but Capcom, you had many years of Monster Hunter to figure this out, buddies.
[51:28.53]Alright, I'm going into Jerma's group, and I'm joining too.
[51:32.59]Like, if I join, am I going to lose?
[51:36.03]Yeah.
[51:36.55]Should I restart the boss?
[51:38.79]Yeah.
[51:40.03]So, are you guys all leaving?
[51:42.50]I'm already here.
[51:43.94]I'm just coming to you, I think.
[51:45.02]Okay, I'm just going to join.
[51:47.42]Hold on.
[51:49.56]After this boss, I'll figure out if I can... If I look it over, my OBS preview is perfect.
[51:55.05]And I have no drop frames.
[51:56.03]Apparently, my stream is a slideshow.
[51:57.65]Communication error.
[51:58.29]It didn't let me join.
[52:03.01]Well, it's your first time.
[52:03.87]I'm about to die.
[52:07.73]I died!
[52:08.25]Oh, there's Vinny.
[52:17.41]Wait, wait.
[52:18.97]Invite me now.
[52:19.63]Invite me now.
[52:20.11]I can't.
[52:23.50]Alright, Vinny, take aggro for a second.
[52:25.08]I'm going to try to invite you.
[52:26.56]Got it.
[52:29.63]I'm here to save the day.
[52:31.37]But what if it was the- I would've fucked the lobby, whatever, I'm just fucking inviting people.
[52:34.45]Oh god, I'm sorry.
[52:36.97]Ster is here.
[52:37.43]I can't- I can't invite anybody.
[52:41.54]Ster has arrived.
[52:45.58]Wait, I'm- I'm in.
[52:48.89]I'm almost dead.
[52:57.07]Oh, he's down, he's down, he's down.
[52:58.07]This is where you want to go absolute psycho mode.
[53:07.81]Select SOS.
[53:12.53]That's to have more people join.
[53:14.85]I think that's more for single player, right?
[53:17.93]Oh, God.
[53:20.47]He's coming back.
[53:31.16]Nice!
[53:38.64]Ooh!
[53:42.69]I don't know what I'm doing on this monster right now, but I'm just jumping around jankily.
[53:46.75]What is going on?
[53:47.57]Okay.
[53:55.22]I'm here!
[53:58.40]Where's the weak point on this guy?
[54:12.83]Weak point is on top at the moment.
[54:15.47]If you get him under the vine trap, I can get him.
[54:24.38]Whoever's got aggro, get ready to... I'm just trying to remember the buttons.
[54:33.29]Yeah, me too, me too.
[54:34.35]I just failed doing the thing I wanted to do.
[54:37.37]Wow, good for me.
[54:38.73]Amazing.
[54:44.61]Oh, it still works.
[54:45.65]That's good.
[54:52.94]Okay, so when in Link Party, it automatically invites people to a quest you start.
[54:56.80]The weirdness happened because you guys were linked and then all doing the tutorial.
[55:00.12]So when the actual quest started, you all invited each other.
[55:02.68]That's the explanation, I guess.
[55:06.37]Okay, I believe you.
[55:07.05]I got aggro.
[55:23.71]I thought I could tell my bugs to go up there.
[55:27.38]Oh, you're using the insect glade?
[55:28.72]Oh.
[55:29.48]Oh, there.
[55:29.80]Well, there you go.
[55:30.88]Come on.
[55:32.82]Let me get another one up there.
[55:33.66]Watch this.
[55:33.92]Ready?
[55:34.24]Boom.
[55:35.94]And then... Damn.
[55:43.04]Get him!
[55:45.56]Be sure to... While we're doing this, you definitely want to use your whetstone.
[55:50.31]You could do it while you're on your animal.
[55:53.50]R1 is sprint, by the way.
[55:56.37]You're on the dog, dinosaur, whatever the fuck this thing is.
[56:03.17]I'm still trying to figure out how to eat meat.
[56:05.63]I got something here.
[56:06.53]A ration?
[56:08.89]I got power coding now.
[56:16.26]How do you eat the meat?
[56:20.14]I have meat that's cooked already.
[56:21.36]I have rations.
[56:21.98]I just don't know how to eat it.
[56:25.36]That's not what I'm expecting.
[56:28.96]Hold LB and select it.
[56:32.05]Oh!
[56:32.87]It's not on my radio.
[56:33.51]In the head.
[56:33.81]In the head.
[56:36.11]Hit that hammer right in the head.
[56:37.11]Nice.
[56:37.45]There you go.
[56:38.63]Bottom right.
[56:39.55]Okay.
[56:41.49]Also, the D-pad on the Switch controller is messing me up.
[56:44.39]I'm pressing left, and it's also pressing up.
[56:47.39]Oh.
[56:48.57]That's fun.
[56:53.48]Oh, got a...
[56:56.16]Weak point.
[56:56.66]Fucking clown weapon!
[57:02.22]What the heck?
[57:10.55]Yeah!
[57:15.69]Okay, I have no more... Oh shit, I don't... Okay, there we go.
[57:41.33]Oh, that was an explosion.
[57:44.10]I'm doing it.
[57:51.36]Is there damage meters at the end?
[57:54.58]There might be.
[57:55.24]Am I on fire?
[57:57.50]Yeah.
[57:57.78]Oh, yeah, I am.
[57:59.78]I still don't know how to eat steak.
[58:02.79]Paint pod.
[58:03.43]I've been trying my whole life.
[58:07.37]I guess I'll make food while the dinosaur is here.
[58:10.85]Y and… We did it!
[58:14.75]Oh, they ate me.
[58:17.97]Alright, make sure you carve this, because we're only allowed to sit here for 30 seconds.
[58:20.37]Put your weapon away and get up there, yeah.
[58:23.45]Everybody, start eating it.
[58:25.59]If this meat goes bad fast, it's like an avocado.
[58:30.37]L, B, Y, or A. Okay.
[58:37.40]Oh, I see.
[58:37.98]There it is.
[58:38.72]Okay, on the bottom there.
[58:42.35]Okay.
[58:42.85]I just got so used to the radial menu.
[58:44.63]Alright.
[58:47.05]Pick up random stuff you find too?
[58:48.89]Yeah, while you're still here.
[58:50.31]Especially here, the mining outcrop.
[58:52.21]These bone piles are really, really useful as well.
[58:56.45]Where's them?
[58:57.23]The fight ends and everyone turns into a goblin.
[58:59.83]Get these bones!
[59:00.49]Get these bones over here!
[59:01.23]Mining, mining, mining!
[59:02.53]You only have like 30 seconds to get everything.
[59:09.88]Oh, I'm not going to get... I need these bones.
[59:13.14]Get them bones.
[59:16.05]Time to do my diary.
[59:18.13]Today I slayed a monster.
[59:22.12]We did it.
[59:22.52]Yeah.
[59:24.99]So now, the hides that you took and the bones you took, that's how you make the other gear.
[59:32.59]Sometimes you need three scales, and Vinny, correct me if I'm wrong, but sometimes there's drop rates for... Oh, you got the jaw this time, and it's like an 8% drop rate.
[59:42.08]I didn't leave you guys coats.
[59:45.14]yeah some some items have very very low drop rates which that's why some people have joked there's a desire sensor in the game because you can kill a monster like five times and still not get that one thing you need but yeah I hope there's not a desire sensor uh well it said that you guys did cool and it leaked all of our info so that's great yep yep yep that was my social security
[60:14.34]Capcom killing it with the multiplayer.
[60:16.38]Great work, Hunter.
[60:17.80]Oh, and the support team made it to base camp safely.
[60:21.36]Great.
[60:22.16]Let's head back.
[60:27.49]Primary and secondary weapon.
[60:29.21]Huh.
[60:31.79]And destroying certain body parts is how you get some of the certain drop rates.
[60:35.89]It gets very complicated, but that's kind of the gist of what we just did.
[60:40.62]I thought you might need these sacred.
[60:42.90]You look after them, won't you?
[60:46.61]Are you sure?
[60:48.05]We don't want a bird in your village.
[60:50.44]Talk to Tom.
[60:51.72]They belong with you.
[60:52.72]I've never met more capable and deserving.
[60:55.22]And I had Gemma make you a new saddle.
[60:56.96]I want to do a secondary weapon.
[61:05.64]And my desire sensor.
[61:07.70]That'll come in handy.
[61:10.58]And one more thing.
[61:11.48]I was wondering if you'd like to visit my home.
[61:14.73]Since Otto is out, my grandmother told me that would be a great time to pay back.
[61:18.65]Where the heck is Ferdinand?
[61:22.49]Great.
[61:23.69]Oh, by the way, everyone's been asking.
[61:27.39]Franz Ferdinand.
[61:29.55]I don't know that guy.
[61:30.29]How do we get for gear?
[61:40.02]meow meow meow meow secondary oh there you go wow this is a first for Monster Hunter having secondary weapons yeah secondary crazy you're doing bow right charm or are you doing bow gun I'm doing bow and then I might also do one of the actual light guns or heavy guns okay
[62:08.12]yeah that's what I heard is that you could I didn't know that was new that you could have two weapons but I had heard that on the grapevine the grapevine you say yeah out here in Italy where I am
[62:24.49]eating is really important too before every mission you should be eating some kind of meal to buff yourself and eating a ration or a steak is will increase your bar yeah there's a whole lot of I had a big breakfast I'm good I'm hungry you want to just drop this and go to Korean barbecue yeah I I damned you okay I'll stay in like the call on my phone but we're gonna go get something to eat
[63:00.75]Bro, I'm colorblind.
[63:01.53]I can't see these markers.
[63:03.59]You can cook meals for yourself with rations or other ingredients.
[63:11.64]Yes, yes, yes.
[63:12.52]Okay.
[63:14.66]It's some of the best-looking food in video games, too.
[63:17.22]It's going to make you guys want to go get Bulgog.
[63:21.04]Bulgog.
[63:22.46]Wait, I think I just... I'm on the next mission.
[63:24.55]Uh-oh.
[63:26.73]Village of Whispering Winds.
[63:27.99]Are we doing that right now or no?
[63:30.79]I think we told me to talk to that person but I decidedly didn't leave for it yeah I'm leaving this quest uh yeah usually takes a few missions to craft something new but you might be able to I'm gonna just keep it rolling until we get some more yeah I think we you want to kill a couple more monsters typically before you start doing armor let's keep it rolling alright where's this researcher
[63:59.82]Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing.
[64:01.38]I want to eat food first, and then I'll be with you guys in a moment.
[64:05.17]Oh, good idea.
[64:06.33]Should I be learning food?
[64:08.87]Food is very necessary, I think, but I don't know how to do it right now.
[64:19.96]I'm, like, stuck in this mission.
[64:21.44]I screwed up.
[64:25.61]use the barbecue to make your food you cook yourself and you cook for yourself in this game oh you can do that in the other with the bra meat right rummy yeah but not like uh I guess advanced meals yeah that monster guide that field guide will show you what damage types are good against this monster and where the weak points are and where to get certain items I think they killed a certain enough times
[64:53.98]So if you go to your tent and you go to grill a meal and you do recommended meal, that's pretty good.
[65:04.24]How do I get off?
[65:07.74]Cook only with rations.
[65:09.16]Health plus 50, stamina plus 150.
[65:11.18]There's a login bonus?
[65:16.05]Claim that shit.
[65:18.85]Lock in bonus.
[65:21.75]You keeping stocked?
[65:26.73]Yeah, I got my login bonus.
[65:31.09]Holy.
[65:34.59]How generous are they?
[65:35.75]Actually, I'm going to see if I can make something.
[65:41.03]Hey.
[65:43.65]Chad, how do I see the other guys in base camp right now?
[65:48.77]What are we making today?
[65:53.07]I feel like I can see your cats.
[65:57.26]Oh, I see Jerma.
[66:05.52]Bone mail?
[66:07.82]Am I able to do this with you guys?
[66:09.20]Like, I screwed up.
[66:09.86]I don't know, can you, like, press escape and leave your mission or anything?
[66:16.43]No, it just says, like... Pew environmental link, you have to turn it off before every bounty board mission.
[66:22.09]Okay, never mind.
[66:22.83]Ready to go?
[66:23.91]Alright.
[66:25.24]So, okay, if I say... If I talk to this person and say, let's head out, it'll just eventually spam invites to everybody once we get to the mission?
[66:36.20]Once we get to the monster, I believe.
[66:37.84]Okay.
[66:40.15]What I've been told.
[66:41.13]I'm going to talk to Ferdinand, I guess, and I don't know, we'll just figure this stuff out as we go.
[66:49.29]I guess I just get to the monster and wait for you guys.
[66:51.47]Okay, then.
[66:52.21]Yoda.
[66:52.63]I guess.
[66:54.73]Whoa, these are harder to handle than they look.
[66:58.67]How many sacred deer people have?
[67:01.61]Lots of them.
[67:02.49]Adults and men.
[67:03.60]This is a game about hunting them.
[67:06.60]Oh, this is Bugenhagen.
[67:07.72]They give you a meal in the quest.
[67:09.02]And the practice can join the Vanguard.

[70:42.19]I'll be right back.
[70:42.95]Give me two seconds.
[70:43.49]Okay, babe.
[70:45.45]Hello.
[70:45.95]Hello.
[71:02.66]I turned my stream settings down.
[71:13.23]We'll see.
[71:13.59]Alright.
[71:17.68]Is this better?
[71:20.80]I mean, sometimes it dips a little, but not what you guys are describing.
[71:28.22]It sounds terrible.
[71:31.48]Is it better now?
[71:33.76]Let me sit down at a thing.
[71:37.64]Here's a cutscene.
[71:58.96]You've never seen the old Hunter.
[72:00.66]What did you find?
[72:04.10]I'm quiet.
[72:04.60]Well, I'm leaning away from Mike.
[72:06.38]How does it work?
[72:08.62]It's called.
[72:09.96]You just toss it into the fire.
[72:11.74]Huh?
[72:14.08]Did you see that still?
[72:15.88]That is still good.
[72:16.50]Good.
[72:16.72]Definitely something strange about it though.
[72:24.16]Lower graphics and cap to 60 FPS so OBS doesn't lag.
[72:27.48]Okay, well, I got it.
[72:29.28]Alright, let me just... I want to get that auto outside.
[72:35.32]I'll be right back.
[72:39.93]We're just doing this boring walk-around quest first.
[72:45.35]Then we can kill some more monsters.
[72:49.13]He called it boring.
[72:50.27]He hates it.
[72:52.73]I'll be right back.
[72:54.99]Enjoy the cutscene.
[73:01.63]Wow.
[73:03.59]Look at this.
[73:05.87]Welcome.
[73:06.77]Greetings.
[73:09.03]Thank you so much for inviting us.

[73:41.44]We hope you enjoy the meal we prepared.
[73:58.66]It looks so tasty.
[74:00.18]Yes, thank you.
[74:03.52]As we gather here together, may we so share in the wind's bounty.
[74:09.95]Please, help yourselves.
[74:12.59]Yes, yes.
[74:14.17]You heard him.
[74:24.52]That looks good.
[74:24.94]I saw that bread tear.
[74:26.32]Nothing like home cooking.
[74:53.95]You guys did miss a pretty good cutscene.
[74:55.65]There was like Ninja Turtles cheese pull.
[75:03.24]Yeah, I don't know what's going on, Charm.
[75:08.28]I'm back, yo.
[75:10.04]Hi.
[75:11.96]Did you fix your thing?
[75:12.95]I think it works now.
[75:14.33]That was weird.
[75:15.79]I'm good.
[75:23.73]Okay, large monster.
[75:24.93]I'm sorry, I'm like skipping everything.
[75:29.59]Hang on one sec.
[75:30.29]Yeah, all that mattered was the food anyways, yeah?
[75:55.77]Alright.
[75:56.49]Perfect.
[76:24.16]I'm at the Village of Whispering Winds.
[76:27.30]Are we all on this one now?
[76:28.48]Okay, optional quests.
[76:31.92]Uh-huh.
[76:56.68]I think I'm ready.
[76:57.80]I don't know.
[77:08.43]So is the world just open now?
[77:10.21]Because it looks like there's a bunch of... Oh no, we're heading towards the forest?
[77:13.83]I guess we're going to the forest.
[77:21.82]How do we do that?
[77:37.88]this way hello hello alright so we're all do we all have head towards the forest as our mission here uh yes okay so is that just out in the open where's sir are you here
[78:10.26]Okay, is there a way we could see each other in the game?
[78:13.57]Like now though?
[78:14.33]Or is it only when the game, the mission starts?
[78:17.33]I think we can probably get started in doing some multiplayer stuff now.
[78:22.75]From what I understand.
[78:23.97]I could also, I don't know.
[78:28.00]Maybe that's not true.
[78:30.20]Yeah, I got the new drivers last night.
[78:32.78]So I don't know.
[78:33.80]If it's having a problem, that's weird.
[78:36.02]I just got them like seven or eight hours ago.
[78:41.50]I don't know let's see um how do we I gotta get back to the town is is there a quick way to get back to the town or you just have to kind of run there uh I think you run there I have no idea but what have I been doing I'm sorry I couldn't hear you guys what are we doing fast travel with map kind of group I'm heading to the forest I'll put the materials I gathered in your item box
[79:07.86]Yeah, where is the forest?
[79:09.62]Like this way?
[79:12.06]We don't have to do the forest right now because we could do quests with each other apparently.
[79:16.40]Press select right on d-pad.
[79:21.47]That's true.
[79:22.45]Maybe the world map?
[79:29.79]My auto move is just having me run in circles.
[79:36.86]Okay.
[79:41.41]Why does this one feel I want to say way messier than world?
[79:45.06]Should we take a break?
[79:49.96]Yeah, that's how I feel too.
[79:52.06]I'm now OK chat.
[79:53.12]I can't do the quest board.
[79:54.68]I'm locked out of it.
[79:55.42]It's like they made it confusing on purpose.
[80:05.92]Just as messy as I remember.
[80:08.47]Disband environmental link.
[80:15.27]Who's Balahara?
[80:28.00]So if I... What if I just do this, right?
[80:31.06]I'm just gonna go out into the open?
[80:32.34]Okay, I have, um... Host or join a quest.

[81:16.22]Which is, so if you're on the keyboard, you do detail, wait, detailed map.
[81:22.46]And then you'll see fast travel list.
[81:24.10]Press that and then go back to base camp if you want to just teleport back.
[81:28.44]Fuck.
[81:32.48]Okay, so what about doing a mission together?
[81:35.76]Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[81:36.90]I want to... Chad, how do I do a mission with these guys?

[82:25.18]Okay, okay.
[82:26.44]Got it.
[82:26.74]Alright, now Jerm, go- go talk to Alma, and you can join the quest, and we can actually fucking do a quest together.
[82:33.32]We got it.
[82:37.15]It's next to your tent.
[82:39.63]How do I even get back to the fucking camp?
[82:42.31]I like went out just to look around.
[82:50.61]Can I mark this?
[82:53.06]You can teleport if you do fast travel, but you have to open map.
[83:02.28]Yeah, you gotta open the map, press right on the D-pad if you're using a controller, and then do... Okay, you got it.
[83:08.11]Good.
[83:08.47]Alright.
[83:09.63]Great.
[83:10.11]I guess we can try now.
[83:11.97]Hey!
[83:14.51]Should I cancel our current quest?
[83:15.95]No, no, no.
[83:16.51]How do I leave our quest?
[83:19.37]What's up?
[83:19.61]What's up, sir?
[83:20.43]Remember we told you guys how fun Monster Hunter was?
[83:29.74]Open departure window.
[83:34.46]Departure window.
[83:37.28]Press select to depart.
[83:38.69]Okay.
[83:40.39]Oh, there you go.
[83:41.70]Depart now.
[83:42.32]Okay, so how'd you do that?
[83:44.76]I pressed select, and I pressed depart.
[83:51.48]Because me and Star were still preparing, apparently.
[83:53.94]Yeah, which keyboard button is select?
[83:57.49]I think my game crashed.
[84:01.81]I have, it says here, crash report tool.
[84:04.77]A crash report is being created.
[84:08.80]Jeremiah, you should have just taken... You should... Dude, we should have just got sponsored, guys.
[84:14.55]We would have been done by now.
[84:17.25]Yeah, my game crashed.
[84:25.96]Alright!
[84:27.86]Yeah.
[84:30.44]Let's go!
[84:31.32]This is sick!
[84:31.74]Okay.
[84:33.15]Okay.
[84:41.25]This is a grown-ass game.
[84:42.75]Yeah.
[84:48.05]Okay, so... I can no longer exit the game.
[84:49.95]You have to turn off auto-run on the fucking horse, right?
[84:53.61]Maybe we should have waited, like, three days after the game came out.
[84:57.81]Yeah.
[85:02.62]We are world first to struggle.
[85:03.98]I mean, I think this is by design, though.
[85:07.60]Yeah.
[85:09.18]The number, like...
[85:11.17]You play fighting games, you get used to the fact that, like, all Japanese games have the worst lobby systems they could come up with.
[85:16.56]They sit in a board meeting in, like, a circle table with their evil hats on, thinking, like, man, how many steps can we add?
[85:25.32]Yeah, and then throw a crash in there, too, just in case you get too excited.
[85:30.00]Um, I don't know if my game saved.
[85:31.79]I'm hoping that it saved.
[85:33.53]I wonder if you can jump back in, too.
[85:35.85]There's no way it didn't save.
[85:37.19]That'd be crazy if it didn't save.
[85:48.29]Oh, hey.
[85:48.55]Hey, we're still here.
[85:50.97]The three of us are still in the lobby.
[85:53.57]Are you?
[85:53.97]Okay, I'm rejoining.
[85:55.55]And then... My game is loading.
[86:01.66]Where is this, like, depart, though?
[86:03.46]Like, depart.
[86:05.04]So that is select.
[86:06.32]You press the select button.
[86:09.44]What if it's a PS5 controller?
[86:12.87]I don't know because that's just that's like open isn't that like take a picture use the drawing pad on the ps5 controller and do like a stick figure and then draw a map next to him touch pad Jerm that's bad if you give me two seconds I'll I'll be back in though I'm I'm starting game now sorry about that dude take your time bro I'm no that's not good it's just we're all struggling we're all struggling equally yeah yeah me and poker almost at the bogey the bulgogi spot
[86:41.42]Oh, I thought you were going to say Bodega.
[86:43.48]We're actually there.
[86:44.16]We're playing on our Steam Deck right now.
[86:48.08]We can do that, honestly.
[86:48.85]Do you have a Steam Deck?
[86:52.81]I do, too.
[86:53.83]Yeah.
[86:55.11]Only Ster, sorry.
[86:56.59]Okay.
[86:57.58]Yeah.
[86:59.56]Can we split into our own separate groups here?
[87:04.59]alright yo Steam Deck people here listen up this is life-changing information I have found oh my game just crashed again oh oh dude oh seven oh seven for Vinny I'm gonna tell you guys about these glasses I found on the internet okay what'd you get they're called the x real one pros I'm telling you this shit's sick as hell
[87:34.66]This was happening to me, you have to verify files.
[87:37.38]Do they let you see HD?
[87:39.36]Yeah, it's like glasses you put on and it puts like a screen in front of you, like a huge screen.
[87:45.77]And it's just, you can plug it into anything USB, bro.
[87:47.77]It's so nice.
[87:48.45]Nah, I'm a believer.
[87:54.15]I plugged that into the Steam Deck, I'm laying down like a zombie.
[88:00.08]I just, you guys, I'm helping you.
[88:01.94]So it's like a glasses monitor?
[88:06.31]yeah yo one one step closer to wally world yes it's amazing I don't know the Steam Deck it's like it's annoying to lay down and look at it do you guys agree or no yes yeah yes I feel like pain is a part of the process I'm a big advocate for reading out of like a real book rather than like a kindle or something because I think if you aren't changing your seating position every page turn then you're missing out
[88:36.22]No, I was laying there in bed with these glasses on with the PS5 controller Bluetooth to the Steam Deck.
[88:42.90]And I'm just laying there playing my Path to Exile remote play HD 90 FPS perfect settings.
[88:50.30]And I'm like, wow.
[88:52.81]Oh my god.
[88:53.67]This is bad.
[88:54.55]This is bad.
[88:55.25]I remember being like 12 with the Game Boy, the original Game Boy with that green and black pixelated screen and you couldn't see shit.
[89:05.53]You guys remember you had to get that thing, that light that hooked on to the back of it?
[89:09.86]Yeah, the warm light I believe it was called, right?
[89:11.74]Yes, yes.
[89:14.00]But that's how I feel right now looking at this new stuff.
[89:16.06]Like, oh, you know what I mean?
[89:18.43]I remember I would be in the backseat of my parents' car and I would wait until the street lights illuminated the Game Boy and then move like an inch in Zelda and then like stop playing until the next street light.
[89:30.36]Oh man, the Game Boy without the light was crazy.
[89:32.74]It's awful.
[89:33.30]Yeah, it was awful.
[89:34.15]Game Boy without the light.
[89:35.19]Oh my God.
[89:37.21]The 3D, wait, which was it?
[89:38.97]The flip 3DS?
[89:40.87]The one that flipped.
[89:42.25]You have a light and then you do a flip down with a magnifying glass?
[89:46.03]The SP was life-changing.
[89:50.24]Okay, I validated my files.
[89:51.82]I'm rejoining.
[89:53.70]But we'll hope for the best.
[89:54.66]I love that you're having issues.
[89:59.92]Yeah.
[90:01.58]My character moves like a football player.
[90:05.71]It's okay.
[90:09.03]Oh, it might actually, yeah, recompile my shaders.
[90:11.27]That's awesome.
[90:12.65]Oh, no.
[90:13.21]I guess we'll find out in a second.
[90:15.79]See you in 40 minutes.
[90:17.69]Yeah, that takes like...
[90:20.27]alright everybody bulgogi break oh I'd love a bulgogi I'm gonna go to the open and just I'm gonna find a monster and just kill it yeah fuck this Vinny guy what are we all doing man I know right he doesn't even eat bulgogi we'll figure out how this works I'm gonna go collect some fossilized bones I'm so sorry Vinny
[90:49.19]No, it's okay.
[90:50.37]Compiling sounds like a pain.
[90:52.89]The problem, Vinny, is that you were the most excited to play.
[90:55.35]You should watch some Teresa videos.
[90:59.69]You should pull up a Teresa video.
[91:02.84]I'm not compiling, so I'm going to join in and see if I crash again.
[91:12.08]If it crashes, I think we may need to just do a new lobby.
[91:17.32]All good.
[91:20.21]and yeah but guys there's nothing really we can really do about it we're just gonna have to wait till we can get in and get this shit rolling or we can do something else or hey not much we can really do about it we're just chilling it's all good okay I'm in I'm in alright so maybe someone else makes the quest or or uh does the the thing
[91:47.37]Okay.

[94:23.39]Okay, thank God you're lying.
[94:24.19]I swear to God, sir.
[94:26.64]My heart dropped.
[94:27.60]Why are you doing that?
[94:29.26]Alright, so we gotta go hunt the Chattacabra.
[94:31.42]Hey, I know a Chattacabra.
[94:33.06]There's a few of them over here on my other monitor.
[94:37.36]That's good.
[94:41.27]I'm just auto-running.
[94:42.57]I'm auto-running to it.
[94:43.57]Oh, it's right here.
[94:44.63]It's right here.
[94:47.58]I gathered some materials too.
[94:49.58]Check your field pouch.
[94:53.45]Who wants to aggro?
[94:55.25]Wait, we put down some traps.
[94:59.97]He's not hostile.
[95:01.25]I don't have any traps.
[95:03.05]Oh, he's pissed now.
[95:03.87]Alright, just go.
[95:07.05]Go.
[95:07.13]Attack.
[95:08.65]How am I supposed to remember the buttons from 50 minutes ago?
[95:11.15]I don't know.
[95:20.35]I'm hitting him.
[95:20.67]I'm hitting him.
[95:21.05]I feel the same way.
[95:21.57]I think.
[95:24.81]Good God, I knocked him out.
[95:26.11]Nice.
[95:41.58]His head is a weak point.
[95:44.32]Ooh!
[95:44.56]Wow.
[95:44.74]His whole body is a weak point to me.
[96:02.54]We're formatting him, we're formatting him, he can't move.
[96:05.42]Chat, is there a way to switch to my alternate weapons now, or how do you do that?
[96:12.56]Oh, he knocked off the thing we didn't knock off.
[96:13.82]Right on the D-pad.
[96:17.18]Wow.
[96:19.40]Everybody got that scale, right?
[96:26.33]I got him!
[96:26.69]That was a bad choice.
[96:36.46]I don't know what I'm doing, but I feel like I'm popping off.
[96:40.55]That's Monster Hunter, baby.
[96:41.97]I feel like I really unleashed my full power this fight.
[96:48.78]How do I follow up?
[96:49.58]You have to mount up first.
[96:51.50]Oh, that's how you do it.
[97:05.26]Yeah, I'm going to just do charge blade instead of the bow.
[97:07.63]I think that's going to require a little bit of practice.
[97:10.77]Nice work.
[97:11.19]Nice work.
[97:12.69]Ooh, big damage.
[97:17.21]I just kind of feel bad for this thing now.
[97:18.71]What?
[97:25.28]Make sure you all whetstone.
[97:32.58]Oh.
[97:34.49]there he goes make sure y'all get your wet stones on him chat you see those graphics glitching somebody out here casting spells that's me are you talking about the the purple flame like the the
[98:03.83]I saw a mage with a wizard hat jump onto my screen and do an assist.
[98:22.31]Do we all get the same wounds?
[98:26.56]Some abilities consume wounds, but do we all see the same ones?
[98:31.47]You know what I mean?
[98:32.53]What do you mean, wounds?
[98:34.01]Oh, I don't know, actually.
[98:35.31]That's a good question.
[98:38.17]I think so.
[98:38.97]I'm going to guess yes.
[98:39.97]Yes, my chat's saying yeah.
[98:42.43]So, like, if someone consumes it with an ability, you kind of don't let anyone else use it, or what?
[98:53.14]Oh, my God.
[98:55.24]That is crazy.
[98:57.06]My damage was crazy.
[98:59.40]I feel it.
[99:00.67]yo you're you're bottom on the leaderboard though oh what really yeah my plug-in's saying you were bottom yo link tree carve carve and then yeah I'm gonna go grab some crap around the map while we have time mining spot by me might be useful
[99:29.69]Random shit.
[99:36.37]Yippee!
[99:39.27]Remember when Anakin said yippee?
[99:41.25]That was a fun moment.
[99:43.29]Yippee!
[99:44.09]Do we both get this?
[99:46.99]It's for everyone.
[99:49.43]Immediately.
[99:50.37]Did I get it?
[99:52.41]Fuck.
[100:01.10]Alright.
[100:01.52]Got a jaw.
[100:10.19]Very calm.
[100:13.05]That's, you know, that's what's fun about Monster Hunter, what we just did there, fellas.
[100:18.08]Yeah, three stuns right there.
[100:19.74]Boom.
[100:21.28]It was very enjoyable.
[100:22.86]Jeremy says there's nothing for Jerma.
[100:25.12]You got Dizzy Pro.
[100:26.90]Damn.
[100:27.32]What the hell?
[100:30.66]Dude, I did... What'd I get?
[100:32.32]I did, um... Tick damage, so... Doesn't show up.
[100:37.54]Same way.
[100:42.12]How is your WoW stuff, like, going?
[100:43.90]What made you want to play WoW again?
[100:45.68]Like... Uh... Watching Poke.
[100:52.14]I saw Poke play, and I was like, oh, it looks cool.
[100:54.62]And then I saw all the cool stuff they were doing, and I was like, oh, this seems fun.
[100:56.74]And then I started playing three months later.
[101:09.28]Don't die, please.
[101:10.45]I'm going to try to stay alive as best I can.
[101:23.61]Upgrade the bone axe.
[101:25.69]Oh yeah.
[101:27.01]I don't know what this is.
[101:35.02]I can get a… I think this is fire?
[101:37.16]I can get a fire bow.
[101:38.40]We have to kill that, uh… That rooster dog thing again.
[101:41.72]I just made another one?
[101:44.60]Oh, oops.
[101:46.16]I thought that was an upgrade.
[101:48.29]There was no upgrades available.
[101:49.43]I think we already had that… those mo… uh… We already killed that guy.
[101:53.93]I think we repeated it, right?
[101:59.61]Yeah, I need two… Oh, the… Whatever this is.
[102:04.20]it might be good to do it again just to you know get more materials and to have fun before we have to do story stuff again it's true I'll go post it which was the weapon tree I feel like uh these town segments I just turned my brain off and I feel like I need to wait until someone says we're ready to go because I have no idea what I'm doing here it's confusing for me too yeah
[102:35.74]done already craft some armor but the enemies don't fight back yet yeah yeah so why do I need it where is she um also you don't want to you can mix and match some armor but I think in my experience with Monster Hunter it's it's usually a good idea to uh like work towards your set your equipment bonuses
[103:06.53]so it's like good to have a full set and then upgrade those but yeah you're good for a little while how do you know what the set is um it's all the same armor it's just the same monster does it have like a special bonus yes here it's stirred like how do you see it um go into the uh menu for the smithy and do forge upgrade armor
[103:32.42]Yeah, I'm on the armor.
[103:33.88]Okay, do you see where it says equipment info?
[103:35.80]And I think if you're on keyboard, press C twice.
[103:40.56]Yeah.
[103:41.54]Now those things that you see there, divine blessing, stun resistance, all that stuff, that's really important stuff.
[103:48.29]If you want to see what that does, I think press R for you.
[103:54.59]And you do skill info.
[103:57.01]and it'll show you yeah I know it's a lot but if you if you do that just try to hover over it with my mouse and it's like nah press seven buttons you guys press other buttons yeah I know okay so um my divine blessing level three is while active reduces damage taken by fifty percent that's really big
[104:22.25]So I say set bonus, but I'm just talking about equipment skills.
[104:24.81]I think there's set bonuses as well.
[104:26.75]But yeah, there's a lot of really good equipment skills that you want to work towards.
[104:32.41]And it's fun to like, actually, when I was playing Monster Hunter for the first time, I spent a while just reading up on what they did.
[104:39.29]And I worked towards armor that did that.
[104:41.47]So you might have one that makes your fire resistance go up.
[104:45.43]You might have one that makes you sharpen very, very quickly.
[104:48.43]So you only spend like one second sharpening.
[104:52.35]but yeah I don't have to do there's no sharpening for the bow right you just you just shoot ammo yeah okay join that quest did you post that quest Jerm yep where was the thing to turn your helmet off uh in your tent then you go to uh change appearance or change equipment appearance and you can go message there
[105:40.54]you're not in the link party because you crashed do I have to get you back yeah if you can get me in the link party if that even will work I don't know right now
[106:01.47]There you go.
[106:11.34]It's... My head hurts.
[106:13.90]I was on the phone.
[106:16.98]By the way, the second monster in the forest area is one you may greatly enjoy if you guys get there, I'm being told.
[106:21.65]That's good.
[106:23.81]What's up, Hoke?
[106:25.63]I think we do... What's the difference of assignment or optional?
[106:31.11]I think assignment is the story progression missions, where we're going to get more monsters to kill.
[106:36.31]Optional is, A, you can just go kill… Oh, we can literally just go walk outside and stuff just roams, but we would have to get into each other's expeditions.
[106:47.78]Um, so doing the optional is just, I think, a quick way to get us in the same place at the same time.
[106:54.50]Yeah, and to get us some equipment, and then… If we did assignment, we won't be in the same match?
[107:02.18]I think it's gonna do what it did last time and we'll be in our own separate games and then oh look you're at the monster now everyone gets an invite and here we are so is that on day three uh probably day six or seven okay I'm ready uh well you gotta join the the we it's just me and Jerma doing this quest right now but apparently the forest is really good so we should after this we should go there
[107:31.98]Yeah, all the beginnings of every Monster Hunter game, you have to just lose three or four teeth, and then the game is like, okay, now we're having fun.
[107:39.82]We're doing Firestarter.
[107:42.56]Yes.
[107:55.47]Alright.
[107:57.33]Everybody good to go?
[107:58.03]Yep.
[108:02.58]Make sure you eat your rations.
[108:06.06]We didn't cook.
[108:06.88]Okay, you go in your tent.
[108:12.60]And then you go to grill a meal.
[108:14.92]We still have meal effects, by the way.
[108:16.30]We still have meal effects from the story.
[108:22.19]Yeah, I'm ready.
[108:23.39]It's all good.
[108:26.93]Alright, let's do it.
[108:28.43]Let's get some more materials and then we can try the assignment mission.
[108:37.43]Yeah.
[108:39.03]Poke.
[108:41.17]I was eating in game.
[108:43.62]Okay, lols.
[108:44.68]I'm departing.
[108:47.96]There you go.
[108:50.30]I was eating a meal.
[108:51.06]A succulent meal.
[108:55.34]Did that guy die?
[108:56.04]I think so.
[108:58.20]I think recently, yeah.
[108:59.70]Damn.
[109:01.04]Who?
[109:01.54]Succulent meal guy?
[109:02.92]Yeah.
[109:03.76]Who's the succulent meal guy?
[109:06.56]I don't know anything about him, but I just saw the video.
[109:09.96]I was eating a succulent meal, and they arrested me.
[109:12.96]Or something like that.
[109:14.96]Yeah, he's just like, uh... Oh, that guy, yeah.
[109:18.38]Wait, get your hands off of my penis!
[109:20.42]Right, that guy.
[109:21.28]That guy.
[109:22.44]Sir!
[109:23.27]Yeah, I crashed, by the way.
[109:24.61]Fuck.
[109:31.73]I wonder if you could join in progress, maybe?
[109:34.95]Can I join them in progress, chat?
[109:44.49]Yeah, I can.
[109:45.79]Alright, we're good.
[109:47.70]My drivers are updated and I restarted as well.
[109:50.88]Roblox.
[109:52.26]There's probably a Monster Hunter Roblox that has a more streamlined multiplayer than this.
[109:58.66]Yeah.
[109:59.60]And it was probably made by a 13-year-old.
[110:05.09]On summer vacation one year.
[110:06.31]Alright, so he's over here.
[110:11.07]I'm just collecting stuff.
[110:11.87]Yeah, just go have fun.
[110:13.29]Go do that.
[110:14.07]I'll join if I can.
[110:15.35]And if not, we'll just do that story quest.
[110:17.15]Go fight him.
[110:18.61]It's all good.
[110:19.11]I'll join.
[110:19.43]It's not going to be fun without Vinny.
[110:25.92]We should get some of these materials.
[110:29.26]Vinny, I waited.
[110:29.88]It's okay.
[110:32.54]Jerma's fighting it alone right now.
[110:33.98]It's just him.
[110:35.44]I have not attacked.
[110:36.54]Ster is the only one attacking right now, by the way.
[110:38.58]Just want total transparency.
[110:39.48]I'm attacking like generic enemies.
[110:42.24]Like the Stegosaurus.
[110:52.17]Yo, so does Command and Conquer work?
[110:56.71]Probably.
[110:57.29]There's a game, by the way, there's a game called Repo.
[111:00.37]I played it the other day.
[111:02.39]Yesterday.
[111:03.83]It's like, um, Lethal Company, but actually maybe better than Lethal Company.
[111:09.77]Really, really polished, really fun, lots of good moments.
[111:12.57]It's great.
[111:13.57]High recommend.
[111:14.29]Hmm.
[111:16.35]Yeah, it was one of my favorite, like, multiplayer slop games, if you want to call it that.
[111:20.33]It's not, it's far from slop, it's just really fun.
[111:22.87]So I would recommend that for us in the future.
[111:26.74]Down to clouds.
[111:29.04]This is some grown-ass man-slop.
[111:33.10]Don't say that.
[111:35.34]Man-slop.
[111:38.12]Grown-ass man-slop.
[111:41.60]Like Lord of the Rings.
[111:42.52]Man-slop back on the menu, boys.
[111:44.50]Alright, if you went to a restaurant and on the menu was something called grown-ass man-slop and it was like three different meats, two cheeses, onions, would you still order it?
[111:57.09]yeah it was called yeah it was just called grown ass man I see the monster how do you switch weapons monster's pissed uh x dude you got an x button monsters it's not mad at me oh wow I told me x before actually it might be because it made me switch weapons and get on my mount at the same time oddly
[112:27.05]Oh, I got it.
[112:27.73]No, I didn't.
[112:28.03]I feel like while you're on the mount, when you press X, it was doing it for me.
[112:40.20]So maybe the mount is holding it for you.
[112:42.36]Oh my god.
[112:44.56]Jerm, are you fighting it?
[112:46.22]What?
[112:46.56]Oh.
[112:47.42]Nope.
[112:48.44]Oh, the mount is holding it.
[112:51.16]You're right.
[112:51.74]I just wanted to get pre-damage on it, so I got an accolade at the end so people didn't make fun of me.
[112:56.72]I'm here.
[112:57.24]I'm ready.
[112:58.24]I made it.
[112:58.88]I made it back.
[113:00.14]Hell yeah.
[113:05.09]Thank you guys for waiting a little bit.
[113:06.51]Wait, you're back here?
[113:07.23]Yeah, I'm in.
[113:08.35]I'm in.
[113:09.01]Okay, at least you can rejoin the game.
[113:12.61]Yeah.
[113:13.91]I'll stay right there.
[113:24.16]We're trying to cut the tail off.
[113:24.92]That's my character.
[113:26.50]Yeah, you get a weapon if you do.
[113:27.94]Yeah.
[113:34.36]They cut off the tail?
[113:36.95]Some moxers you can, sure.
[113:38.15]I don't know about this one, maybe.
[113:49.12]Yo, I'm all up on...
[113:57.02]oh get in there oh boy I'm just not aiming my weapon right oh classic nuclear issue yeah
[114:24.75]Okay, so what do you do if your starting voice choice was like a really squeaky?
[114:29.13]And he does that every time you attack now.
[114:31.83]Oh, that's bad.
[114:32.71]But you can lower the pitch.
[114:36.24]Okay.
[114:37.22]Otherwise, you need to use a voucher to get that.
[114:39.94]I sound like a Worms character.
[114:41.74]How do you use abilities?
[114:45.02]A lot of them are passive.
[114:46.55]But what abilities are you talking about?
[114:47.79]It's mainly weapon combos that you're doing, you know?
[114:50.79]Yeah.
[114:58.01]Yeah, the turkey is really weak in the neck.
[115:02.98]Oh, because of his gobbler.
[115:08.38]Yeah, I can't remember how to reload the thing.
[115:10.22]How do I just reload?
[115:13.33]No, um... Oof.
[115:13.75]Oh, fuck you.
[115:21.31]Come on.
[115:23.88]RT plus B?
[115:24.68]I think we're thinking of the wrong buttons here.
[115:27.61]Got it.
[115:28.51]So I'm using the switch pro controller.
[115:30.18]OK.
[115:38.50]Who?
[115:44.30]Yeah.
[115:48.83]Is there is there like friendly fire?
[115:51.45]We can knock each other around.
[116:25.46]He's running, he's running, he's running.
[116:36.14]We have him on the run.
[116:37.06]Oh my God.
[116:43.55]Oh my God.
[116:43.95]Oh wait, he just aggroed like another monster.
[116:47.81]Oh boy.
[116:48.43]Okay.
[116:48.59]Wait, let him fight.
[116:49.11]Let him fight.
[116:49.49]Let him fight.
[116:50.49]Oops.
[116:50.96]Oh, good point.
[116:51.68]Yes.
[116:53.52]What does Thorngrass Pod do?
[116:57.88]Um, I don't know actually.
[116:59.66]Yeah, they do.
[117:00.02]Sometimes it's like a flashbang.
[117:01.74]They do different things.
[117:02.83]It's like four or five different kinds, I think.
[117:08.54]I need to put a regular potion on him.
[117:10.50]He is kicking the shit out of this rooster, by the way.
[117:12.93]Should we help the rooster?
[117:14.29]He's taking our care.
[117:16.49]I don't know.
[117:21.53]I'm just following orders.
[117:24.03]He just scared me.
[117:25.47]He's running away.
[117:26.14]Right in the belly.
[117:29.04]This guy hurts a lot, by the way.
[117:30.24]Be careful.
[117:30.92]Wait, I'm chasing the old bird.
[117:32.96]I'm chasing the old bird.
[117:33.78]Yeah, that's our mission.
[117:34.70]This is optional.
[117:37.14]Should we do a guard point slash?
[117:39.28]I beg you.
[117:40.27]I don't remember how to do that.
[117:41.61]I'm sorry.
[117:42.87]This thing's out for blood.
[117:46.25]It's coming.
[117:55.98]Oh, man.
[117:58.44]Same.
[118:21.41]Oh, that doesn't work.
[118:24.87]Someone cast a spell.
[118:27.51]I wish I had one.
[118:29.81]I mean, there's like flashbangs and shit.
[118:32.69]Change shells while holding A while doing it to charge the shield.
[118:39.34]Charge shells, you mean.
[118:41.62]You could press select to skip that, by the way, the cutscene there.
[118:46.86]Or the equivalent of select.
[118:48.32]Alright, I need... Okay, there we go.
[118:55.22]I need one more of those.
[118:55.92]I need one more igniter.
[118:59.25]Please, please.
[119:00.09]Fuck.
[119:01.71]I'll trade you.
[119:04.87]We gotta kill this again.
[119:05.77]I need another igniter.
[119:06.73]Let's do it.
[119:12.08]Other than the annoying everything, the game is really fun.
[119:19.81]There's a reason this series is as big as it is.
[119:23.49]Like I said, it's just getting through that first couple of hours of figuring out what every menu does and where they moved every single thing, every single iteration.
[119:34.82]And the game doesn't crash, and the game runs at more than 30 FPS.
[119:39.84]And they... Yeah, it takes about a week.
[119:42.70]And then it's like one of the best games ever made.
[119:44.71]Do they allow modding?
[119:45.75]I don't think so.
[119:48.17]I don't think so.
[119:51.39]Shit, honestly, seamless mod would be nice.
[119:56.07]Yeah, we could get a seamless co-op mod for this.
[119:58.95]Something's bugging my screen.
[120:03.15]Dermot keeps not getting an accolade.
[120:05.13]Alright, but let's be fair here.
[120:07.32]Vinny's is you stealthed two times.
[120:10.34]I don't even know what that means.
[120:11.76]And yours is you gathered honey 13 times.
[120:15.76]So what you're saying is you did nothing.
[120:19.04]If the bar is that low and you didn't get one.
[120:22.45]No, I gathered probably 12 times instead of 13 times.
[120:25.29]And maybe I stealthed once.
[120:28.28]alright step it up get more honey I'm getting an accolade this time and then I'm gonna you'll see

[121:07.18]Bugging in the desert.
[121:09.78]Oh, you've never gone bugging before?
[121:11.70]Oh.
[121:13.18]Me and the boys out in the dunes.
[121:15.02]Do you guys have the emote bugging?
[121:17.16]Or do you guys have no emotes?
[121:19.52]I don't have any emotes.
[121:21.55]I've seen it.
[121:22.21]I've seen it.
[121:23.31]It's a good one.
[121:23.87]I like it.
[121:24.51]I think I have it under a different name.
[121:25.97]I don't know.
[121:27.85]Gregory.
[121:28.45]You probably have it under Gregory.
[121:29.71]Gregory.
[121:30.51]Ready up.
[121:31.05]Ready up.
[121:35.35]I want to get more coatings and stuff too.
[121:37.43]Oh, I get poison coating.
[121:39.23]Ooh.
[121:47.10]Favorite type of monkey.
[121:48.10]I'm going to have to go with the classic orangutan.
[121:52.72]I like peanut butter monkeys.
[121:55.86]I can't choose.
[121:56.92]I don't know anything, honestly.
[121:59.66]I just love them all.
[122:01.18]Yeah.
[122:04.00]There's this one channel that just uploads this orangutan driving a golf cart.
[122:09.26]And I swear it's just the same video like a hundred times, but each video gets like a hundred million views each time.
[122:16.02]It deserves it.
[122:17.52]I wish that came up on my recommended instead of the crap that it gets my YouTube.
[122:23.29]That video has probably been clipped and recompressed and shared so many times.
[122:27.33]It's probably started at 1080p and it's probably like 180p now.
[122:31.27]He works at that golf course.
[122:32.81]Like he got a job.
[122:36.19]Yeah.
[122:37.61]I just love when they're doing anything that just looks like they don't give a shit about anything.
[122:41.65]It's so funny.
[122:45.59]What do you pay a monkey and banana?
[122:50.20]In gum.
[122:52.02]Let's be sure to use that.
[122:53.18]Can monkeys chew gum?
[122:54.44]Like do they physically have the ability to chew bubble gum?
[122:58.46]That's ableist.
[122:59.76]Yeah, but they would swallow it.
[123:04.92]I swallow gum.
[123:05.90]I'm not going to lie.
[123:07.50]I haven't done that for at least seven years.
[123:10.10]Wait, wait, honest, real.
[123:12.71]So you swallow gum, it stays in your stomach for many years.
[123:15.63]That's a lie.
[123:17.75]It's a lie.
[123:18.65]That is not based in any medical doctoring science.
[123:23.70]So that's made up.
[123:26.99]do you have proof do you have source site source um what I don't have any proof all I know is that I heard that on the internet there you go like that was the downside if they do stay in your stomach then wouldn't that like decrease your total stomach size and it would help you lose weight if you ate a bunch of gum oh my god it also would lock up a bunch of plug you up
[123:52.15]Yeah, but everybody these days has a Cinco stomach, so you can just reach in.
[123:57.39]Gun Zempik.
[123:59.19]What are you guys talking about?
[124:02.17]Diet plans.
[124:03.56]Are you guys ready to rock and roll?
[124:04.94]New Age diet.
[124:05.76]I'm here already.
[124:06.70]Yeah.
[124:07.38]Oh, I went the long way.
[124:10.60]You can just let your dude get you there.
[124:12.58]It's kind of nice.
[124:13.88]I'm fine.
[124:17.15]I'll just farm in some... I get this off.
[124:18.75]I'm the champion.
[124:19.61]I got it off.
[124:23.26]Did you realize?
[124:39.11]Oh, baby.
[124:45.31]That's 77 crit.
[124:46.95]That is a personal best.
[124:57.91]I'm losing damage.
[125:04.14]Nope, wrong way, buddy.
[125:04.94]There we go.
[125:20.67]I'm glad I didn't let the haters talk me out of insect glazing.
[125:24.58]Do you remember how to charge your shield?
[125:26.78]Uh, no, I don't.
[125:28.28]Well, if you're enjoying it, that's good.
[125:29.50]I was just worried it would be too complex for your first Monster Hunter, but I'm, you know.
[125:36.31]Every weapon's viable, it's just how well you can master it.
[125:40.51]Man.
[125:40.77]Tail broken.
[125:41.55]Tail broken.
[125:43.03]I repeat.
[125:44.31]Be sure to carve the tail, by the way, guys.
[125:46.01]If I don't get an accolade for that, it's bullshit.
[125:57.97]Yeah, Vinny's the hater.
[126:01.23]Drinking the haterade.
[126:11.80]We've got ads.
[126:13.92]Random dinosaurs just showing up.
[126:28.16]Ooh, head broken too, damn.
[126:29.54]We're going to get a lot of good shit here.
[126:43.51]Oh, there it is.
[126:44.01]There's the shield charge.
[126:49.43]So is it on the ground or do we pick it up at the end?
[126:52.79]I'm going to have to do a tutorial on this weapon.
[126:55.09]It is very complicated.
[126:59.32]Yippee.
[127:06.30]Oh, man, I also have to... Yeah, I'm squandering it.
[127:09.49]Ask Limes.
[127:11.09]That's Limes' weapon, right?
[127:16.81]I used to know how to do it.
[127:29.69]I love that shotgun move.
[127:38.46]I gotta shoot him right in the head.
[127:39.32]Come on.
[127:39.80]Right here.
[127:41.12]For the power coding.
[127:41.82]Where the fuck did it go?
[127:46.27]Ooh.
[127:46.55]Hit the enemy.
[127:47.11]Hit the enemy.
[127:47.67]Hit him.
[127:49.67]Can we clear comms?
[127:53.75]Clear comms?
[127:55.11]Yeah.
[127:56.13]I'm talking about...
[127:59.63]Huh?
[128:01.33]Oh, that like clear communications.
[128:03.20]Oh, you're doing a bit.
[128:04.16]I was like, what is this?
[128:05.02]This guy knows Monster Hunter.
[128:06.14]It's like speaking in Monster Hunter lingo I'm not aware of.
[128:12.72]Got to clear the comms off the monster.
[128:17.28]I wish we had a DPS meter.
[128:18.60]That would make my enjoyment of the game go up by a multiplier.
[128:21.48]A hundred times.
[128:22.81]Button go up.
[128:24.49]It's too controversial.
[128:26.37]Yeah, I just got what I needed.
[128:27.71]I'm ready to make my fire bow.
[128:29.84]I'm the man.
[128:30.66]I'm the man.
[128:31.24]Anything else here?
[128:37.62]Just looking around.
[128:45.80]Any bugs out here?
[128:46.66]Anybody bugging?
[128:50.16]I'm bugging.
[128:51.08]Any bug chasers?
[128:58.59]Okay.
[129:00.01]You need charge blade training.
[129:01.37]Yeah, I'm going to go back to the other weapon, switchaxe.
[129:04.68]DPS overlay mods are already out.
[129:07.20]Is that fake?
[129:07.82]Am I being lied to?
[129:12.48]What did they say?
[129:13.02]Can you repeat that?
[129:13.95]They said DPS overlay mods are already out.
[129:17.75]Oh, I'll get it if you get it.
[129:20.81]What Pixar movie should I watch?
[129:22.21]It's really important.
[129:23.09]Please tell me.
[129:23.93]You should watch Up.
[129:26.77]You could get banned from modding, says one of my chat members.
[129:30.60]What are they gonna do?
[129:31.92]Who knows if true.
[129:33.14]What are they gonna do?
[129:33.80]They're gonna ban you.
[129:35.46]Stop playing.
[129:42.10]Okay, this is where I think it would be useful for us to do the forest mission.
[129:48.55]Yeah, let's do assignment this time.
[129:51.07]Yeah.
[129:51.89]Can we queue up for it?
[129:52.81]Let's try hosting and see what happens.
[129:54.83]I think we just have to go go there and then when we fight a monster we'll all end up getting an invite that's my I don't know I think which one on their tails or slimy situation ready to get to work all righty um I think it's the it should be just the default one that says go to the forest yeah whatever that one is I don't think it's an assignment it's not yeah it's just kind of happening regardless I think
[130:27.18]Cool.
[130:27.72]Got my bow.
[130:28.92]I'm happy.
[130:29.76]What was the... Okay, so assignments.
[130:48.80]Event quest maybe?
[130:49.82]No.
[130:52.48]I think we just have to just walk there, like you said.
[130:54.83]Yeah.
[130:55.27]Yeah.
[130:55.59]I'm going to try that.
[130:57.73]So where is it?
[130:59.87]It's a red dot on the map, apparently.
[131:04.59]What?
[131:06.47]I don't see it.
[131:07.47]Head towards the forest.
[131:08.55]I see.
[131:09.99]Yeah, I see a couple dots.
[131:18.19]Map.
[131:19.03]Detailed map.
[131:23.03]This is to the Riverside Trail.
[131:26.52]Is that correct, Chad?
[131:27.46]The Riverside Trail?
[131:31.36]That is correct, apparently.
[131:34.41]Alright, head to the Riverside Trail.
[131:35.53]Chad, is this real?
[131:49.45]I mean there is again like I'm just kind of letting the the dinosaur go where it wants and it's taking me in the opposite direction so that's cool I just did that as well and I just corrected it yeah it was the top left of the map and I'm following the people in the cutscene now
[132:26.30]I don't know what we're talking about.
[132:28.54]Is it the question mark?
[132:29.92]Windward succulent?
[132:31.06]I think we just have to walk outside the camp and then to the left of the map.
[132:38.81]Yeah, the top left of the map.
[132:40.21]There's a path that goes up and it takes you to a new zone.
[132:46.53]I'm actually astounded at how bad the auto move is.
[132:51.20]Wow.
[132:51.94]It just ran me in circles last time I tried to go to the forest with it.
[132:55.43]Okay, I'm not doing that anymore.
[132:56.55]Okay.
[132:57.55]Yep, got it.
[132:58.33]Yeah, make sure you're picking up ore and stuff on the way because you're going to need it for upgrade materials.
[133:04.73]Make sure you're picking up ore.
[133:06.29]Or what?
[133:08.47]Oh, you're going to be fucked.
[133:12.41]You're going to fall so far behind.
[133:16.19]The auto move is good to get you to a monster, but not, you know.
[133:19.16]I'm sorry.
[133:19.78]Maybe not this.
[133:31.25]I don't see jemma and nata yet okay honestly this is a rare case where I'm gonna say I wish I had a motorcycle instead of a dog to ride that's okay yeah they should make motorcycles out of monster bones and like the tires could be made out of like uh rathalos scales you'll meet the rathalos eventually you'll like them if you get any sleep at all
[133:58.57]Oh yeah, Pokémon had a flesh motorcycle.
[134:02.63]That's right, it did.
[134:04.13]It was called Maridon.
[134:06.83]A flesh cycle?
[134:07.83]Kinda.
[134:08.05]Alright, I'm at the top of the leaderboards because I made it to the next zone.
[134:13.40]Whoa.
[134:13.66]I'm almost there.
[134:15.72]Forest findings.
[134:38.99]What about this Leviathan in the sand area?
[134:41.57]Do you guys see that guy?
[134:44.49]Yeah, random monsters will pop up.
[134:47.35]They can kind of... They have different criteria.
[134:49.35]Oh, it has to be at nighttime and this temperature.
[134:54.44]Oh, don't crash, please.
[134:55.32]Come on.
[134:56.84]Oh my God.
[134:57.34]What was the top of the map for you guys?
[134:58.70]I think my map is rotated.
[134:59.80]Yeah, it does that.
[135:02.96]Oh no, I went... I'm not... I don't know.
[135:05.94]I'm not there anymore.
[135:10.45]Could you open, like, the actual map?
[135:13.53]Yeah, then you could rotate it.
[135:16.23]Uh-oh!
[135:16.45]You can turn mini-map rotation off.
[135:28.13]Oh, I definitely want to turn that off.
[135:29.13]I hate that.
[135:35.94]Why do I smell ozone?
[135:37.68]I smell electricity.
[135:41.17]Do you have a carbon monoxide detector?
[135:44.59]I do.
[135:45.97]Okay, then you're fine.
[135:46.74]Did you get some shungite?
[136:07.51]why though it'll be a fun mystery to unravel they know what that is over here no it's is that a meme I'm unaware of no so it's a crystal shug night these crystals I've got them all over my house should night no not the guy the crystal
[136:33.65]we got a new camp now so the forest is full of symbiotic systems involving the roots leaves flowers and fruit and it's the insects job to pollinate alright I think I want to try all the way to the other side but I'm almost there who is that who just did that
[136:57.33]That was impressive.
[136:58.07]That sounded like it hurt.
[136:59.99]That was the cat.
[137:00.77]I'm glad we didn't disappoint.
[137:02.57]We'll give you a hand.
[137:04.40]Thanks.
[137:07.90]That guy just feels like he's in a different video game universe.
[137:15.70]And he got, like, there was a DLC pack of a friend of the developers.
[137:21.83]Please, call me Olivia.
[137:26.04]the guild gave special assignments uh are we all in the forest yeah I'm doing the quests in the camp here let's talk are we talking to Eric and leaving or we is that a group thing I talked to Eric and and now well no I'm going to talk to him now so I'll just do that alright
[137:48.61]Okay, he said let's head out, so I don't... Are you ready to leave?
[137:56.80]I don't know if we need, like... We might probably be a little while before we get to fight again together.
[138:02.58]Alright, I'm just going to blast.
[138:05.02]Load up RuneScape.
[138:10.17]Or TrickShot Simulator.
[138:11.27]Do some trick shots while we're doing this.
[138:13.63]I hate that that became a trend that just feels like torment oh it was yeah it was kind of fun though I mean I got like five of them but then there were like two that made me like want to just like give up and never play the game again so much appreciated come see me when you're but the torment is what gets you the viewers that's what they want
[138:42.04]They want to see you suffer.
[138:44.94]They want to see 18 hours of trying the same thing.
[138:47.68]I just talked to Eric.
[138:51.56]I need those viewers.
[138:54.39]You do, yeah.
[138:57.43]You have them.
[138:59.17]Nah.
[139:00.09]You play Overwatch still.
[139:01.19]That's psychotic.
[139:05.97]Like three times in a year!
[139:10.14]Alright, just head to the campsite.
[139:12.18]Explore.
[139:12.82]Yeah, I'm talking to Eric and he's just like, yeah.
[139:16.16]Yeah, he's making me explore.
[139:26.07]We'll follow this river.
[139:31.91]There are a few plausible explanations.
[139:36.11]It could be an excess of certain types of plankton.
[139:40.31]Give me that dung.
[139:43.95]This area's cool.
[139:47.41]Yeah, it's nice to not look at, like, yellow desert for a little while.
[139:52.20]So I'm happy about that.
[139:53.62]What's up with this guy?
[139:54.44]Wait, did I head out yet?
[139:55.12]Yeah, head out and it's going to walk you through the zone.
[139:59.82]Oh, okay, okay.
[140:11.65]Don't wander off too far now.
[140:13.47]I want to collect that shit.
[140:15.51]Please be your character, no.
[140:28.63]Don't wander off too far now.
[140:37.77]Wait, what?
[140:42.91]What the hell is that?
[140:43.72]Oh, it's a cat.
[140:44.68]I was like, what?
[140:45.26]That's it.
[140:45.74]I've decided to live out here.
[140:48.96]I love large poisonous insects that could kill me in one bite.
[140:53.38]This is my new home.
[141:11.25]Oh, I got a new... Ooh, there's different coding on this.
[141:13.61]This is fucking cool.
[141:22.48]What does that do?
[141:24.10]Close range?
[141:24.90]Oh yeah.
[141:32.06]Doshaguma.
[141:33.87]Gotta find the Doshaguma now.
[141:36.43]Okay.
[141:40.16]I have to go, okay.
[141:45.93]Why do I have like a purple poison ball on my arm?
[142:04.85]I still can't believe the size of this forest.
[142:07.24]Every step brings another fascinating discovery.
[142:11.52]And it feels so vibrant and alive.
[142:13.66]It's getting going, though.
[142:16.26]Where do you even begin?
[142:17.72]So many things to study and collect.
[142:21.41]I'm about ready to dash off into the trees like a madman.
[142:25.83]That settles it.
[142:27.09]I've decided to live here.
[142:29.75]Alright, alright.
[142:30.73]Enough joking around.
[142:32.13]Focus on the task at hand.
[142:37.22]Oh, also, how's the frame right now after I turn the stream off and turn it back on?
[142:45.05]It's still kind of a little bit sloppy, but is it better than it was before?
[142:48.29]It's better?
[142:50.82]Okay.
[142:51.12]I just got there.
[143:09.37]Alright, I think I just made it to the camp.
[143:10.43]That's where I'm at.
[143:15.34]Yeah, I'm looking for the shugma tracks.
[143:30.99]Use your hunter vision?
[143:32.19]Wait, isn't that a witcher thing?
[143:34.56]Yeah.
[143:34.90]Or a Zelda thing or a... What is even happening?
[143:36.90]Saturation is low.
[143:37.78]Detective mode?
[143:38.24]Okay, I'm fighting the detective.
[143:39.92]Ugh.
[144:10.05]I don't know if you guys can join me but I'm fighting the thing already well yeah it's not that much further I'm fighting it now too it's cool I think we're about to be on it lucky voucher used it's it's a really cool spider thing I like it but um invitation list I don't see it
[144:44.34]I just don't see the pros of a grouping system like this.
[144:47.02]I just, I'm flabbergasted.
[144:50.22]Flabbergasted.
[144:53.22]Flabbergated.
[144:53.84]That actually sounds like the correct way to say that word.
[144:59.48]Thank you.
[145:01.63]Why did they put an S in there?
[145:02.91]Annoying.
[145:05.39]I don't know how to fight this guy with you.
[145:08.49]There's no gas.
[145:09.19]Same.
[145:11.87]Let me solo her.
[145:12.73]I'm sure we'll find something here.
[145:14.41]I have to look at the ground leave quest first oh yeah I remember you do the solo by yourself I found something else the boss can you like group up in the boss too if it's leaving gashes like this yeah we should be able to that's what I've been I've been led to believe
[145:35.45]I think it's gonna pull us into every once everybody gets there so you have to like play with your friends and you can get to the boss by sending an sos player open the radial menu and do an sos that might open it to other people too though right I'm winning support from other players sos is public they're telling me apparently this is just the intro still the intro is just really bad for this
[146:06.88]link with your friends we were linked we went we went and did this linked and it's not sending out invites yeah we might just have to do this one no you link up with your friends you need a single player quest you have to do all the single player requests by yourself and when you all have to be synced up in the single player quest at the boss part to group up I see right like that's that's how it works that's what we wanted as players we wanted that yeah so now I'm on the bus
[146:36.52]So should I just join one of you guys now?
[146:38.34]I would love that.
[146:39.00]Yeah, I got Poke's invite.
[146:41.97]Wait, you got the invite?
[146:42.87]Yeah.
[146:43.33]If they're in a squad together, it will automatically give you the option to join when someone is fighting a monster.
[146:49.99]But now I can't open the menu from the invite I got.
[146:52.51]So when you get to the boss, you just run around and wait.
[146:55.87]Can I get a squad invite?
[146:57.35]Vinny, you're not linked because you crashed.
[146:58.91]Oh.
[146:59.68]Oh, shit.
[147:00.66]Can I get you in here now or do I have to wait until after?
[147:02.88]I don't know.
[147:05.51]Let me see if I can get you in here.
[147:09.49]I might not be able to.
[147:13.39]Chat told you a while ago, Melpert.
[147:16.42]Well, I don't have a neural link from chat directly to my mind.
[147:21.62]Damn.
[147:22.94]Most streamers have those now.
[147:24.86]Yeah, come on.
[147:32.19]Alright, would you link the chat Neuralink into your head if you heard in your head every single message that came through, but they had to spend $10 to do it, to chat?
[147:42.12]Would you heard it loud in your head every single message?
[147:46.06]No.
[147:47.10]Is there an acceptance?
[147:52.06]I think I'm doing it.
[147:57.82]if you see member list you can invite me I think to member list maybe I'm loading touch that nest and we'll be next but sir join the quest but we're in a group but we're not a member linked our members aren't linked I understand
[148:24.67]That's really cool.
[148:26.07]Also, it spawned me in the town and I have to run all the way over to you, Poe.
[148:30.09]No way!
[148:34.49]That's fucked up.
[148:37.77]This is a cool monster, though.
[148:38.91]I like this one.
[148:40.34]Love the monster.
[148:41.02]Should we just do it again together after?
[148:46.28]I'll take it from here.
[148:46.98]Oh...
[148:55.68]Alright, Polk has sent me an invitation.
[148:57.02]Alright, I just joined Polk.
[149:06.27]Did I?
[149:09.97]That's what I did at work.
[149:15.51]I don't think I went anywhere though.
[149:26.72]Should we not kill it?
[149:27.40]Kill it.
[149:28.76]I'm just going to kill it on my own.
[149:30.10]I'm going to kill it on my own.
[149:31.56]Just kill it.
[149:32.88]I can't join you guys.
[149:34.24]But mine's probably close to dead.
[149:36.22]Maybe.
[149:36.50]I don't know.
[149:56.22]trying to shoot the legs maybe I don't know what's an sos player yeah that's the sos my chat was saying is public so he can't do it
[150:29.34]Is it resistant to fire?
[150:39.14]Ooh, that was good.
[150:43.79]Me, me, me, me, me.
[150:47.01]Yeah!
[150:57.22]I broke its fuzz, I guess.
[151:01.66]Alright, come on.
[151:10.85]How do I do my... How do you do it?
[151:23.60]This enemy is cheating.
[151:33.71]Someone's running away.
[151:34.59]Right in the face.
[151:44.56]Ooh, that was good.
[151:53.95]That's all I'm hearing.
[151:54.65]Mario?
[151:55.47]Anime Mario?
[151:59.25]Wait, I'm low.
[151:59.69]I'm gonna heal.
[152:06.86]Make sure you whetstone.
[152:11.10]Ow.
[152:11.67]Ooh.
[152:12.35]Ouch.
[152:12.81]Owie.
[152:16.83]Yeah, I think you've shooted in his bum.
[152:17.91]I gotta get the SOS flare off of my hotbar.
[152:22.01]Holy crap.
[152:29.68]That's not very fun.
[152:31.84]When they shoot a cannon in your bum.
[152:34.46]I'd like to put my bum on things.
[152:37.30]Remember Tom Green when he said that?
[152:38.80]I like to put my bum on things.
[152:40.15]And he got really famous for it.
[152:41.57]Wow.
[152:42.97]That hit the charts too, by the way.
[152:45.45]It did.
[152:49.27]I have a problem in that Freddy Got Fingered is a terrible movie, but it makes me laugh like a maniac when I watch it.
[152:56.20]It's a real problem.
[152:58.96]Oh, that was my move.
[153:05.46]I'm so sorry that happened to you.
[153:13.14]Climate, how do you climb it?
[153:16.22]I've been doing that.
[153:17.88]I don't.
[153:18.58]Sometimes I just do it.
[153:20.52]Oh, I think you press the F. Oh, bear.
[153:28.63]Oh, what the?
[153:30.33]Oh my God.
[153:33.43]I wish we could all see this together.
[153:36.88]I got mine.
[153:38.34]Just do what Vinny does and say, hey, Star, check this out.
[153:42.49]I say that.
[153:43.09]It's true.
[153:43.51]That is the thing.
[153:44.07]I say, I call you at three in the morning, and I say, hey, Star, check this out.
[153:48.57]Well, yeah, that.
[153:51.04]By the way, don't dilly-dally.
[153:52.26]The boss can actually heal if it finds a place to sleep.
[153:56.84]Wait, how did you climb this?
[153:58.30]What the...
[153:59.98]I just walked up a... I just walked up... Just walked up a waterfall?
[154:04.49]Yo.
[154:07.79]I don't know how I'm doing the spinny move on my mount, but it's just working.
[154:31.71]Get over here.
[154:35.99]Okay.
[154:50.99]We certainly are hunting.
[154:53.33]We are hunting.
[154:54.93]You know, separate, but we're together and and yet separate, fighting monsters together.
[155:02.11]Very weird.
[155:06.31]You know, it happens.
[155:07.53]What was happening to my character?
[155:09.03]What the fuck?
[155:09.71]Is that a brain worm?
[155:18.31]I mean, finally, you admit it.
[155:22.92]right here I did not admit it I questioned if it existed alright me and poke win you guys are so slow we killed it three times already wait why am I digging into the ground oh I have paralysis
[155:51.97]Paralysized.
[155:54.53]Yet again.
[155:58.50]Make the hope axe for the iron accelerator.
[156:07.92]Spider has a baller ass swax.
[156:10.84]Thank you, chat member.
[156:12.16]I like the way you said that too.
[156:16.02]Lala Barina tree.
[156:18.88]It looks fluffy.
[156:25.94]Equipment skills going wrong.
[156:30.67]I'm doing so much fucking damage.
[156:33.71]How is it still alive?
[156:37.88]Paralysis.
[156:39.06]Paralysis is a good element.
[156:49.84]Sorry, I was on the phone, sir.
[156:52.74]Were you meowing while you were on the phone?
[156:55.34]Oh, no.
[156:56.22]No, that was me.
[156:56.85]Barking.
[156:57.87]Oh, nice, sir.
[156:59.13]Master Mounter, you mounted two times.
[157:01.29]Damn, how'd you do that?
[157:02.39]I can go for more.
[157:03.83]I can go again.
[157:04.49]What does that mean?
[157:08.24]To mount more or you want to play more?
[157:10.80]Both.
[157:11.02]Alright.
[157:12.60]Play a little more.
[157:13.24]There we go.
[157:13.60]Alright.
[157:14.48]Mine's dead.
[157:25.24]Yeah, I'm probably, I'm down to play until maybe like, I don't know, another half hour, 45 minutes.
[157:32.55]I know it doesn't feel like we've been playing a long time, but we're already three hours in.
[157:38.49]Three hours, three fights.
[157:39.39]Yeah, pretty much.
[157:41.25]We fought like three things together.
[157:42.51]Did I get everything?
[158:02.44]Okay, I think I'm good.
[158:04.24]Wait, I got a new hammer though, but now I'm happy.
[158:06.26]Oh man, this outfit.
[158:10.64]I hope this hasn't soured you on future play sessions.
[158:22.94]No, not really, because now if I'm unlocking quests, what would sour me is if the game kept crashing.
[158:30.58]I'm going to keep playing them.
[158:33.08]I think it's just about to get going here.
[158:34.40]I think it's just the beginning that's really bad.
[158:36.58]I'm not going to lie.
[158:37.72]Really bad for grouping.
[158:41.04]Yeah, it's pretty rough.
[158:42.58]Everything else is nice.
[158:44.04]I understand what they're cooking here.
[158:46.14]You have to have humanity and then put your sign on the ground and then have someone find your sign where you put it down.
[158:52.78]What the fuck is all this happening for?
[158:54.44]Somehow it's worse.
[159:00.94]I'm not going to lie, somehow it's kind of worse.
[159:04.13]How is that?
[159:07.59]I'm sorry, Monster Hunter fans.
[159:08.81]I'm sure it's great.
[159:09.49]Just the beginning part is crazy to me.
[159:12.05]You're crafting duplicate.
[159:13.37]How do I upgrade my armor then?
[159:16.33]I think it just has to be the next one on the list.
[159:19.23]Like you just auto craft whatever you're clicking.
[159:21.08]I don't know.
[159:22.54]You can't yet.
[159:23.82]Oh, never mind then.
[159:25.30]I'm just crafting useless materials.
[159:27.04]That's awesome.
[159:28.92]um alright I'm back at the thing we got to link up when you guys are back at the base camp I'm back because I'm not linked with you guys alright I don't remember how to add a link I can add a link here I got you I haven't used the daggers ones I don't know if I like it I like the hammer I'm sticking with the hammer alright I'm linking
[159:59.83]The hammer is really good.
[160:00.67]It's really fun.
[160:02.60]Yeah, I'm linked.
[160:03.70]And I think we can now get to a point where we can do some missions together.
[160:08.74]That would be nice.
[160:09.46]Oh, I see you linked.
[160:12.68]I still have meal duration.
[160:21.21]Yeah, I'm going to go eat dinner here.
[160:30.87]okay should I be transferring items it's yeah that's helpful like not all of them but like the the materials you know like like the random materials you find I think I'm gonna go I think I'm gonna get a bone blade bone blade two no are we in the link
[160:59.44]Says we are.
[160:59.78]How do I even know?
[161:00.60]Because I talked to Alma and she said no... We only have one optional, which is to fight the freaking spider again.
[161:09.21]Okay, and I have to go ahead to the pop-up camp.
[161:14.05]Yeah, maybe so.
[161:14.79]I'm at the table.
[161:29.54]Just making him weapon.
[161:32.50]I'm gonna go to the pop-up camp and just see what happens over there.
[161:35.60]Uh, you're able to fast travel to it.
[161:46.29]Really?
[161:47.33]Yeah.
[161:48.90]Well, head to the pop-up camp.
[161:49.96]You TP to it?
[161:51.92]Uh, I pressed the M for map.
[161:53.32]I don't know how you do that.
[161:54.60]And I was able to click on it and fast travel.
[162:01.06]oh yeah and there's these um league of legends creatures here yeah little fellas new newest little fellas just dropped plushies and merch sales up ten thousand percent I can't find it I don't know why I'm so bad uh it's all the way to the left like little section to the left
[162:43.43]near what number I'm still blind it's like the red marker there's I'm colorblind it's the gray marker dude yeah it'll have like a quest marker on it
[163:02.73]It's the same symbol as the top right of your map when it says where to go.
[163:07.64]I don't know.
[163:09.52]I can.
[163:09.74]It's hard to tell you when I know keyboard controls.
[163:12.86]I see what you're saying.
[163:15.68]It's this one.
[163:16.23]Greetings to you.
[163:17.71]Sorry that we got off on the wrong.
[163:21.85]Oh, I'm I'm there.
[163:23.67]Oh, yeah.
[163:41.33]Can the cat talk to them?
[163:46.33]Stuck?
[163:49.27]I'm just letting the gameplay itself now.
[163:52.29]I think I'm bugged out.
[164:08.92]I can't get off my mount.
[164:11.60]You're stuck on the mount.
[164:13.16]I got on my mount when the little guys came out.
[164:15.04]That's just how I always feel.
[164:16.83]Like, no, they got on the hut, and it says, go with the Linneans, and I'm just stuck.
[164:21.01]I can't move.
[164:25.21]Okay, that's, yeah, that's weird.
[164:27.17]Yeah, it was auto-traveling me on, like, the whole cutscene.
[164:29.55]He's watching the cutscene, and he didn't wait.
[164:31.61]Yeah, I'm watching this whole thing.
[164:34.90]Oh, okay.
[164:35.84]What the fuck?
[164:36.56]Yeah, bub.
[164:47.19]want you to really take in the culture this is a Disney park ride where you're on the slow machine like the horror things pop out and scare you but also there's no horror things the um the the Monster Hunter games that I I played for the past 15 years
[165:05.53]like yeah there's the single player mode and then the multiplayer opens up and you just do stuff separately in multiplayer and you just do quests you unlock a higher rank more monsters open up and it's just like I feel like they went overly cinematic with this one and it's kind of been heading that way since world but Vinny you're still in the tutorial that's why it's like this this is four hours of tutorial so far then if that's the case
[165:34.70]So we're just doing the campaign and then later on we just do the bosses later, right?
[165:37.99]So we're just supposed to do the single player on our own.
[165:41.79]Because the multiplayer is its own progression.
[165:44.85]All of low rank is tutorial, I'm being told, right?
[165:47.48]So that's, you know, it's just a while before you get to the... Question though, how many more things is there?
[165:53.14]Chat, how many more things is there?
[165:55.26]Like how many more bosses we got to do in single player until it's like more streamlined multiplayer?
[166:08.16]10 or so before.
[166:09.00]10 to 20 and then there's like 50.
[166:16.76]How many total bosses are in the game total?
[166:20.10]40, 50?
[166:20.22]I'm just going to be a little controversial here for a second.
[166:30.19]I don't care about this.
[166:33.11]I don't care about any of this.
[166:35.03]I just want to fight cool monsters.
[166:37.86]I've been advocating for years for a caveman mode in games where it's just like, hey, I just skip everything, get me to where I play.
[166:45.81]That's how I played Avowed for like 10 hours.
[166:48.49]I was like, what the hell am I doing?
[166:50.96]But, like, I do love story and games.
[166:53.16]Like, some of my favorite games of all time are heavily story games.
[166:56.16]I do not play them for gameplay.
[166:57.79]I play them for the story and the music and the world.
[167:00.93]That's fine.
[167:01.75]There are other games where I just want to enjoy.
[167:04.77]Caveman mode sounds phenomenal.
[167:07.37]So, you know...
[167:12.54]Sorry, Ster has sent me an invitation.
[167:15.32]Oh, I just started a fight.
[167:16.34]I'll be there.
[167:18.64]The details doesn't even work.
[167:19.75]It farted.
[167:21.25]Can't even join.
[167:23.33]Can't even join.
[167:24.15]It doesn't matter.
[167:25.25]Can't join.
[167:25.81]No, I can't join.
[167:27.23]Wait, are you done the cutscene?
[167:28.71]Are you done the cutscene?
[167:29.85]Vinny?
[167:32.13]I did a cutscene.
[167:32.91]I found a bunch of things and we talked.
[167:36.75]I'm still standing here.
[167:42.22]I think I'm going to return the titles.
[167:43.82]Wait.
[167:55.59]Can't do anything.
[167:58.31]So leave.
[168:00.47]Retry mission.
[168:02.65]There you go.
[168:11.97]well Jerma did say the the tutorial was two hours long so yeah that's true and it's funny I did the opening off screen I was like I'm ready I'm prepared this the tutorial is over we can get in party now this is perfect oh my god this is this bug is beyond but I'm but
[168:39.40]I'm beyond bugged.
[168:59.23]Okay, now I can... Oh, Poke has left the link party.
[169:02.14]Uh-oh.
[169:03.12]Yeah, I just... I had to leave to main my title.
[169:07.62]Do you hear that?
[169:09.79]just got your invite but then it went away move as quietly as you can I think I think poke's angry with you guys no I love you guys angry with the game sending me a lot of wild dms read it all of expletives read it how do you guys still not know how to do co-op um we do we're we're playing the game as it's intended oh my god no way
[169:39.76]Guys?
[169:40.45]Guys?
[169:41.11]Oh, I'm good.
[169:41.43]Okay.
[169:41.81]Okay.
[169:43.53]Oh.
[170:00.15]Yeah, caveman mode in games would just be... It's just... Okay, here we are.
[170:05.33]You've opened the game, and you cross the title screen.
[170:08.41]And it would just say on your screen in big, bold letters, Go that way.
[170:12.95]Monster there.
[170:14.31]Go fight.
[170:15.55]Bring honor.
[170:17.61]And that's it.
[170:18.11]And a huge arrow would just be pointing in the direction, and that's where you go.
[170:21.55]You could skip the whole beginning.
[170:23.29]Are you leveling in WoW with RxP?
[170:26.50]No, I'm walking around like a dickhead.
[170:28.90]You should.
[170:29.24]You literally just follow the arrow and nothing else.
[170:34.97]But at what point are you no longer a human, but like a meat computer?
[170:38.81]You're playing WoW.
[170:40.35]No, that's a good point.
[170:41.15]That's why I don't, but you know.
[170:47.60]I like to consider myself a meat computer.
[170:49.50]I guess we all kind of are, right?
[170:52.20]I mean, in the end, yes.
[170:54.58]We're all meat computers.
[170:58.76]That's not to me, computer.
[171:00.44]Did he just shit on us?
[171:11.17]Oh, it's poop.
[171:12.17]You're right.
[171:12.57]It does poopy.
[171:13.69]Does a little poopy.
[171:14.61]Oh, hey, Vinny.
[171:16.73]I'm finally here.
[171:18.46]Performing for you.
[171:20.44]He's almost dead.
[171:21.46]I've been rolling him like a blunt.
[171:24.76]This is one of the worst cutscenes.
[171:26.54]I'm sorry.
[171:28.34]what I'm doing right now?
[171:30.00]I'm a hater.
[171:31.40]I'm sorry.
[171:33.04]Am I in your game?
[171:40.22]How do I join your game?
[171:45.86]Um, stirs game?
[171:47.82]Yeah, okay.
[171:48.52]Why do you have to go through four menus to say I want to join your game?
[171:52.15]Four menus, then you have to go back to the camp, and then you have to go back to the monster.
[171:58.83]Just got a tooltip to look around.
[172:05.27]Am I in your game?
[172:16.22]It gets cancelled if you get hit.
[172:19.24]Yes, it does.
[172:20.04]Oh yes, that happened to me.
[172:21.16]Yep.
[172:43.01]am I doing it watch that this is my favorite enemy so far but it's really
[172:58.14]scary when you cut its head off at the end I like that I'm coming yeah this monster shall now I'm just gonna call it uh-oh stinky every time I play this game now alright I'll be there in 700 minutes it's almost dead yeah wait invite me
[173:27.11]I don't think I can.
[173:29.67]I don't think we can invite you while we're fighting monster.
[173:34.61]Unless you already randomly have one in the invite menu because we're linked, it might be there.
[173:39.13]If you go to that kind of menu that shows your notifications and it says, oh, stirrers has a monster available, I think you can click that, say details.
[173:47.58]It'll open up another menu.
[173:48.70]You can click yes, click the mission yes, and then it'll load, but don't get hit because it'll quit out of the game.
[174:07.65]Yeah, I'll get some free shit.
[174:08.29]Sure, I'm just gonna get here just as this thing dies.
[174:10.09]At least he farted on me.
[174:13.27]Where is this?
[174:24.20]Your cat made a noise again.
[174:25.54]Is this part of the- I thought you said you've played these games before.
[174:33.86]Played a couple of them.
[174:46.29]It's eating its own tail.
[174:49.35]And that's why it died.
[174:51.19]Wait, this is toxic to me.
[174:56.14]It shoved its tail down its throat and killed itself.
[174:59.48]Choked on it, yeah.
[175:02.74]Oh, you were here.
[175:03.36]I think Pope is going to have to do this quest now on his own.
[175:06.87]Oh, God.
[175:09.40]poke is I'm sorry poke I I wish you were having a better experience I wish we all were to be fair but you know what it's a shame that this is your first well this isn't your first one right you played worlds I think you said World of Warcraft of the warcraft worlds made way more sense
[175:39.70]monkey too I wonder can we can we just join off of poke's mission maybe oh shit we can just queue them up and do a rotation oh that's good yeah that's smart
[176:06.33]I've drank so much of this Wretched Frost Chillsicle.
[176:11.59]It's so bad.
[176:13.83]It's trying to distill popsicle into flavor, but it's not good.
[176:19.54]And I have to pee so bad, so I'll be right back.
[176:22.42]Okay.
[176:29.95]I heard all about your great exploitations in driving off the pink menace.
[176:36.80]Can we have our puny hovel back?
[176:38.60]Get the campsite back.
[176:47.62]Here's too many lopsided transactions between us.
[176:50.86]What if we offered you, say, brown pelts?
[176:54.53]Too many and awful.
[176:57.53]I suppose we'll be going then.
[177:00.59]Until our next wheeling's ending.
[177:07.69]so the doshakama must be traveling in a pack and they have a leader in numbers monsters we better follow up yeah let's have oh you're back and now that base camp is up and running little problems are cropping up left and right might be good to see if anyone needs a hand but that's what us hunters are here for right
[177:43.51]Or even if like a game had something called a fuck you mode.
[177:46.82]Where it's like, oh, hey, by the way, we're not going to teach you anything.
[177:49.92]You're just going to get to like the point where you need to know what you're doing and fuck you.
[177:54.16]I would check the box on half of these games.
[177:55.56]So where are you?
[177:57.98]Hmm.
[178:07.87]There's a lot of fuck you games.
[178:09.03]They're all good games.
[178:11.19]I I accidentally showed one on stream yesterday It was called haunted by femboy Haunted by femboy.
[178:26.16]Yeah We should play that like after
[178:36.97]okay so there is this optional quest to do uh the orangutan the spider the uh and the chattacabra everything we fought already effectively understood
[179:10.05]wow yeah we have to um is poke on the mission they were talking about fence boys oh yeah I'm ready to uh to help poke now I can get in there and help poke okay so how to will it pop up or something I think we will poke we have to be in the link I think
[179:41.10]poke is the only one not in the link party so poke do you want to invite us to your link party uh was it not a link we're not linked and therefore I don't think we'll be able to help you with your request oh let me kill this guy then uh he's almost dead alright yeah by the time we got there he probably would kill it
[180:13.48]Camps and easily found areas are vulnerable to monster attacks.
[180:17.99]You guys just need to link it and it'll be smooth sailing.
[180:20.31]I feel like we've been linked.
[180:21.85]We keep re-linking and linking.
[180:23.47]We linked again and then we link and then we keep going.
[180:26.11]Yeah, we've been linked the whole time.
[180:28.29]Yeah.
[180:30.53]Currently in a link.
[180:31.65]We're linked.
[180:47.43]This guy has huge balls.
[180:49.50]Yes, he does.
[180:53.20]Coil.
[180:56.47]Ready to head out?
[180:57.29]Stench resistance.
[180:58.79]There's a thing to watch?
[181:00.89]Okay, campsite.
[181:02.09]Here we come.
[181:39.55]Why is chat so moody right now?
[181:40.97]I think we're all kind of just trying to get through the tutorial here.
[182:04.58]I have not been paying attention.
[182:06.06]What are we doing?
[182:06.66]I don't know who said that.
[182:10.99]that could have been a couple of different people in this call yeah including yourself maybe yeah that could have been that could have been me and then I could have said that to throw you off that was Ster he's a goofy goober sometimes he'd just be doing voices this is really getting out of hand what are we doing
[182:40.08]We're doing voices.
[182:42.28]Oh, so am I crazy?
[182:44.06]I feel like I used to get my ass kicked and die and stuff.
[182:47.07]I feel like the monsters haven't really been that much trouble.
[182:51.59]They haven't pushed back too much.
[182:52.97]No, I mean, Monster Hunter, for me, it's gotten easier in the beginning.
[182:58.15]Over time.
[182:59.81]I remember when I played Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii.
[183:02.56]It was the fucking...
[183:05.73]Oregon with the big chin yeah him and also uh barry off or something I don't know but like there's brick walls that you get up against and it's like I spent like 20 hours on one monster it's crazy once you do we'll be here for you okay we're comparing the next quest I don't I imagine it's single player anyway
[183:38.23]Well, I mean, here's what we have.
[183:40.13]For our optional quests, we can kill the same monsters we've killed already.
[183:44.69]Low rank.
[183:45.21]Yeah, that's true.
[183:46.11]The ranks do get higher.
[183:46.89]Main mission complete.
[183:47.71]Chapter one.
[183:48.17]There are 34 chapters?
[184:14.84]Wait, are you serious?
[184:15.46]I killed him, finally.
[184:18.78]No, I'm just saying words.
[184:20.38]Oh.
[184:21.12]The store just says things.
[184:32.71]Poke, what was that?
[184:33.65]You're still killing it?
[184:35.59]Just killed him.
[184:36.97]Okay.
[184:37.11]Okay.
[184:38.46]because I don't know what's wrong we were attacked by a horde of sand leviathans it must be the monsters we saw yeah the quest board is just kill more of the same dudes we've killed already so I think we should probably even consider advancing the story even further yeah but at what point is it want to keep going I don't know
[185:06.05]I don't know.
[185:06.43]I think it opens up.
[185:07.67]You might have to actually beat the campaign before you open up like all the stuff.
[185:11.85]I don't know.
[185:12.17]I don't remember.
[185:13.05]Or at least get to a section of the campaign.
[185:26.22]I don't know.
[185:32.13]you know how uh some of the battlefield games had like a 20 to earn all of the progress and skip progression they did yeah one I forget which one they tried that I feel like Monster Hunter can maybe do that for his next game like that's what they're building up to you can't do this alone I would pay for that I I would right now they got me
[185:57.13]This should be the free play mode.
[185:59.17]I start at the next quest and there's a monster and I'm fighting it.
[186:04.83]Oh, Ster has sent you an invitation.
[186:06.71]I can't take it.
[186:07.29]Why not?
[186:09.04]I can't take it.
[186:09.88]How do I do in the link?
[186:10.72]Oh, no.
[186:11.00]What the fuck?
[186:12.80]Well, Poke isn't in the link, so... Here it comes!
[186:18.28]Watch out for the mucus!
[186:19.94]I can't take it anyway.
[186:21.02]I don't know.
[186:22.70]I talked to Alma and they... It pretty very quickly throws you into the fight.
[186:27.61]and this is the from the tutorial you know where you're running through the sands and stuff so I feel like this might be towards the end I don't know I feel like there was build up yeah we gotta get poking here we gotta get poking here yeah we gotta get him in the lake hold on
[186:48.29]You okay?
[186:49.31]Are you hurt?
[186:51.66]I think I can manage.
[186:52.68]Let's get away from here.
[186:58.27]As I feared, he picked up our scent.
[187:00.75]Okay, yeah, like, we're in the very beginning of the game right now.
[187:03.43]If there was just a caveman on screen before this happened, and he was just like, You found man on ground.
[187:10.47]Man on ground hurt.
[187:12.15]You bring man on ground to camp.
[187:14.09]He heal.
[187:15.72]Then you kill orangutan.
[187:18.28]He poops on you.
[187:20.18]Now here, you fight now.
[187:22.86]Just give me that.
[187:24.36]I'm fine with that, too.
[187:26.60]I'm not kidding, I don't know how to join the Link.
[187:30.12]I'm trying everything here.
[187:31.71]It's not kidding.
[187:33.11]When you're in the game, how do you even... Wait, Link, hold on.
[187:35.19]I think I can do it.
[187:37.93]I'm forgetting buttons.
[187:38.71]I don't even know how to use the potion.
[187:42.01]Invite to Link.
[187:44.27]Uh, there you are.
[187:44.77]Got you.
[187:46.71]There you go.
[187:51.41]I'm Zelda.
[187:53.42]Are you on a Hunter's Pride, Stirr?
[187:57.02]Yes.
[188:01.37]I'm shooting a bomb.
[188:02.95]Still can't even join you guys.
[188:07.69]Well, that was kind of bait.
[188:09.01]It said, hey, Stirr is doing this.
[188:10.93]You can join his, and there's a big red X on it.
[188:16.84]Well, I died from it, so maybe if I could join someone...
[188:21.47]I just ran in circles and tried to remember the use item button.
[188:24.52]Oh, I see.
[188:24.94]Gotta encounter the monster first.
[188:27.68]That's what I'm being told.
[188:29.12]We all have to encounter the monster separately, and then we can join each other's thing.
[188:32.58]Oh, okay.
[188:36.27]Yeah, so whoever sees it next, I'll join you.
[188:38.81]I am in it right now.
[188:48.26]Oh, apparently I'm still in the building.
[188:51.84]Yeah, I really feel like this is kind of like a trust me, bro.
[188:55.02]The game is really good.
[188:56.02]I believe if you press select and go to communication tab.
[189:00.46]I did something from there before.
[189:03.90]That was where you join the invitation list and then I can join you.
[189:26.54]okay I just joined I just started a fight I just started one so if you guys want to join off me or I don't know
[189:41.53]I'll join press select to go to communication and you should be able to join Jeremy got it dude I got a pop-up from you benny and a pop-up from Ster asking me to like join both of your games I got a communication error
[190:06.89]Cinema.
[190:07.84]Because you have to not get hit by the monster, right?
[190:10.49]So that's the thing.
[190:11.09]You got to see the monster, but then not get hit by the monster.
[190:18.89]funny because the gameplay loop of of this game is probably so so fun because the gameplay loop of the other ones is amazing yeah these games are my favorite some of my favorite in like co-op multiplayer gaming like easily oh yeah and um but you know it's just yeah they're going more cinematic is what it is right they're going more cinematic
[190:50.29]Go to camp to join?
[190:51.71]Like, join from camp?
[190:53.57]I'm with you, Dermot, right now.
[190:54.79]Please don't go to camp to join.
[190:55.99]No, no, I'm not going anywhere.
[191:02.21]Get away from here!
[191:11.93]And Star's voice.
[191:23.67]And then like, you know, I was in the fight.
[191:25.95]I was like having fun.
[191:27.43]And then it like puts you in the base camp.
[191:29.65]It's like just throws off the pacing of the whole thing.
[191:32.96]Yeah, you have to run all the way out into the desert to find where you just were.
[191:38.58]It's astounding.
[191:48.37]I have nothing in my invitation list.
[191:49.65]How do I join?
[191:52.03]You have to see the monster first, Poke.
[191:53.83]I see the monster.
[191:55.49]I'm on him.
[191:56.15]Are we in the link together?
[191:57.19]Did Poke get the link?
[192:00.69]Did you go to the communication menu in the select screen?
[192:07.55]Yes.
[192:13.69]Heck if I know, Buster.
[192:17.65]I see your quests, Pogue.
[192:21.01]Something popped up for me to join your game, Pogue.
[192:25.75]I wonder if I- Okay, what do I do?
[192:29.11]I'm just gonna do re- I'm gonna do re- Can we do restart mission?
[192:35.30]All of us?
[192:36.86]We could just join you, maybe.
[192:38.70]Yeah, let's see what happens if we join you.
[192:39.88]Let's just join Pogue.
[192:41.16]Fine.
[192:47.72]What the hell is this?
[192:50.24]Invitation list and communication.
[192:52.36]I'm joining poke.
[192:53.68]Okay, joining.
[192:54.64]Hey, you guys came.
[193:18.11]uh those of you saying next game uh I I want I like this game I like Monster Hunter I just want to get to the part where it's not a lot bunch of stuff again so we'll see you in about 10 minutes poke yeah just block hold block yes very good I think we're in right I'm in
[194:02.20]Capcom's reasoning for this is a legitimately immersion, by the way.
[194:06.12]That's interesting.
[194:08.98]I'm immersed.
[194:10.27]There's a lot of emerge happening right now.
[194:12.49]I have mind sickness right now.
[194:19.89]I'm fucked.
[194:22.50]I'm almost here, Pug.
[194:23.14]I'm here.
[194:24.24]I'm here.
[194:26.31]Let's just add this to my list.
[194:27.97]I believe every game studio needs a modern role called the desk slammer.
[194:35.07]That just goes around and make sure everything's OK.
[194:37.25]And if it's not, they slam your desk and they throw your computer on the ground.
[194:40.37]They undo all the bolts in your chair in the morning.
[194:44.53]Damn, dude, that's harsh, but I like it.
[194:47.51]Do you think that the co-op would be this way if they had a desk slammer, though?
[194:50.86]No, probably better.
[194:52.16]It would be better.
[195:04.32]oh you guys it'll come up here once they like injure it I think alright there we are hello the sand deformation is cool at least and I like that he's leaving
[195:35.30]I agree, honestly.
[195:39.80]Oh, no, chill, chill.
[195:40.50]Now, that's a good raw quack.
[195:44.76]Wait, was that you quacking a moment ago?
[195:46.98]Yeah.
[195:48.66]Oh, you have a quack, too.
[195:49.68]Yeah, raw quack, huh?
[195:51.52]I'm more of a conversationalist quacker.
[195:53.50]You had, like, an actual duck call.
[195:56.77]I can do my voice for Scoot the Duck from Animal Crossing is...
[196:08.62]I don't want to hear that ever again.
[196:16.20]That sounds like a merchant at a... You're behind a counter and you sell all kinds of weird devices and weird drugs and stuff.
[196:27.07]Why devices?
[196:32.24]Oh my God, we just fucked him up!
[196:40.70]Donald Duck horror movie.
[196:42.24]As soon as Donald Duck goes, you know, public domain, you'll see that.
[196:48.14]Don't worry, I'll make it, I'll make it.
[196:49.54]He's got a weak point on his left leg.
[197:02.76]We'll mount up again.
[197:03.54]Right next to the leg.
[197:18.83]I like the sand covering your character.
[197:21.98]That's a neat effect.
[197:23.60]Yeah.
[197:30.54]Damn.
[197:34.80]Right in the neck.
[197:38.58]Oh.
[197:43.02]Oh, this is going to be big.
[197:46.82]Oh.
[197:50.28]It wasn't big for me.
[197:51.84]I wanted it to be though.
[197:55.47]I feel like I've just gotten worse and forgotten half the buttons every time.
[198:01.25]Like I reached my peak and it's over.
[198:05.42]Insect life, dude, we told you, man.
[198:09.66]Told you about that insect life.
[198:16.33]Wow.
[198:17.13]Somebody is doing magical powers.
[198:17.95]Man, that's fun when you get some combos off like that.
[198:20.09]I do have a magical power.
[198:21.21]It's in the switch weapon.
[198:24.03]It's like a discharge.
[198:26.73]Pretty cool.
[198:30.33]Make sure y'all are whetstoned.
[198:35.99]Oh, man.
[198:38.03]I love Poke's, like, annoyed voice.
[198:41.69]I'm not annoyed.
[198:45.27]Wait, I'm not annoyed.
[198:46.15]Okay.
[198:51.93]You'll know when I'm annoyed.
[198:52.79]I'm not annoyed.
[198:53.37]Okay, gotcha, gotcha.
[198:54.67]That's his nerd voice.
[198:56.06]Oh, okay, I misunderstood.
[199:00.65]Make sure you pick up the Exquisite Fossils.
[199:08.53]One day, Jerma, when we get older, you too, Pokkenster.
[199:12.30]You already are!
[199:13.06]We will be Exquisite Fossils.
[199:16.32]If we're lucky.
[199:16.98]I already am.
[199:18.52]It already feels that way.
[199:21.32]Yeah.
[199:22.74]I've been saying I'm 40 for the past three years now.
[199:26.81]Because you're preparing yourself for when it actually happens, right?
[199:29.91]Yeah, yeah.
[199:42.01]I've mentioned this, I can't wait to be old.
[199:46.17]What do you like about being old?
[199:48.75]That you get to basically do character select again.
[199:50.85]You get a new subclass.
[199:55.35]really that's how you do that's interesting like once you start getting to get like really old guy face textures and hair and everything you can totally like there's so many people I can't be right now but like old creepy weird guy is such an awesome one that's who you want to re-roll as yeah creepy old guy like like
[200:20.55]mysterious circus man you know what I mean that sounds awful but that's fine mysterious circus man when you're like young then it's kind of bad it's like weird teen novel kind of like what is he going for I don't know but if you're like you sound like you're talking about an actor though like someone play like those roles we're all just playing roles babe yeah I guess you're right
[200:50.76]collect is it a bone spot yeah make sure you get the bones or oh no no no it's mining it's fossil exquisite fossil where where where where by me look on the mini map you'll see the orange thing
[201:19.87]Grab that.
[201:20.27]That's good for you.
[201:30.77]Like, can you imagine wearing a wizard hat right now at the age you're at with the hair you've got?
[201:35.71]You commanding no respect, but I have a full gray beard.
[201:39.89]Yeah, sure.
[201:40.25]You have the wizard hat, but do you have the persona?
[201:43.16]Can you pull it off with the right mic?
[201:47.98]Very much effort.
[201:49.46]become a wizard my friend it doesn't count to just wear a wizard hat and talk like this you can make a lot of money too though yeah the amount of um casting calls for we're looking for a wizard and they need to be at least 60 to 70 years old you could if you really trained you could get all those roles
[202:20.27]It's funny because while we were gaming, I got an email to be in a show.
[202:30.84]And it seems fake.
[202:32.02]It seems like a fake email.
[202:35.09]They want me to sing lyrics that you forget or something.
[202:39.17]And it just seems fake from a Gmail account.
[202:42.39]Is it a game show?
[202:43.98]Yeah, a game show.
[202:49.61]get the four horsemen on it I'm gonna send it to you guys you know I mean reply at your own risk but there's no time to explain if we get promo or lava lamps I think it'd be worth it for us um I really want to go all in on the lava lamp venture I think it's great me too hunter oh my room needs it I got this sick lava lamp I want to get another one trying to convince her

[203:45.87]Jerma, are you the only one that hasn't crashed?
[203:49.22]I don't want to jinx it, but I believe so.
[203:54.04]My screen was messed up earlier, though.
[203:55.28]I had to exit and restart it, so... I had also issues, too.

[206:24.85]Alright, are we joining?
[206:28.03]I'm still going through the whole thing, yeah.
[206:32.47]I may not have crashed.
[206:33.53]It may have been a time-freeze cutscene.
[206:36.63]I don't know, because I restarted and I was still in it.
[206:39.13]I mean, the cutscene is sick.
[206:44.38]Yeah, there's lightning and shit.
[206:45.64]It's really cool.
[206:46.30]And they're falling in the sand.
[206:47.72]Wow.
[206:49.20]Yeah, the colors are awesome.
[206:51.06]Holy shit.
[206:52.24]Let's go.
[206:53.91]There's a lot of them.
[206:54.53]We've come a long way with animal graphics.
[206:59.27]The fur.
[207:03.13]Remember when the first game had the fur?
[207:05.68]Wasn't it like... Metal Gear Solid when they showed his mustache?
[207:10.88]They showed his mustache on Metal Gear Solid?
[207:12.98]Oh yeah, that was a big deal.
[207:14.74]The reveal.
[207:15.92]Which mustache?
[207:16.88]Which Metal Gear?
[207:18.89]uh four oh old snake old snake yeah look he has a mustache now he has hair do you remember when cloth physics and when the first were introduced and every time the clock doesn't move you would hear a from your graphics card I love coil wine they seem pretty riled up
[207:54.07]Oh, I'm hunting the big guy now.
[207:55.68]Can we join each other now?
[207:58.76]We can try.
[207:59.34]I think Buster might be not able to.
[208:04.66]I just got there, too.
[208:06.44]I believe.
[208:07.26]I got Vinny's.
[208:07.84]I'm joining Vinny's.
[208:10.37]Who are we joining?
[208:12.77]I'm going to join Vinny's.
[208:15.55]You can't, buddy.
[208:16.41]You're not in the link because you exited.
[208:19.21]Hold on.
[208:19.69]I can fix that.
[208:23.41]nobody pogged yet but on the main menu I did the join the link yeah I guess I'm not in the link I'm ready to join you can just join the link and we can just reset tell him to leave quest and check if alma has your quest up to join yeah but then if he has to do all those cut scenes again that would suck
[208:47.61]I think I'm good.
[208:48.25]Oh, Ster has joined.
[208:49.91]Alright, join mine if you can, Ster.
[208:52.29]I can't join yours.
[208:53.07]Why not?
[208:53.41]I see the monster right now.
[209:01.25]Maybe I got... I don't know.
[209:02.09]We could try joining Jerma's.
[209:05.21]Can you join Jerma's?
[209:08.39]I don't see anybody's right now.
[209:09.65]I'm going to hit the monster like one time.
[209:11.54]That's what happened to me.
[209:15.77]God, everybody get the fuck out of the way.
[209:18.29]Yeah, I think... Okay, so what's going to happen is Ster's going to start it, and then it's going to pop up for us, and we just join Ster again.
[209:25.54]So you guys shouldn't even be hitting it.
[209:26.70]Attack the Alpha and get his attention.
[209:30.36]So we need to get his attention?
[209:34.89]Wait, did you say not to hit it or we should hit it?
[209:36.71]Wait, what does your mission say right now?
[209:39.58]Get the Alpha Doshaguma's attention.
[209:42.74]Oh, you're not there yet.
[209:43.60]You're not there yet.
[209:44.46]You got to do hunt.
[209:45.62]When it says hunt the Alpha Doshaguma, then you're good.
[209:49.58]Yeah, just keep hitting them, and then your guy will auto-mount and just start running.
[209:55.47]Hunter friend request from start.
[210:00.71]Yeah, I haven't gotten it into the hunt stage.
[210:03.61]Not right now.
[210:11.32]There's Poke.
[210:12.04]Alright, good, good.
[210:12.66]No, Vinny, I think we need to leave because Stirr.
[210:15.62]Fuck.
[210:16.30]Are we joining Stirr?
[210:17.36]Because Stirr won't.
[210:19.44]I should be able to join Vinny once I get this.
[210:23.26]Give it a minute, yeah.
[210:26.36]Oh, I'm on it.
[210:33.02]Is that why I spell Ozone?
[210:36.76]What is it?
[210:38.34]I just got a bunch of artifact on the screen.
[210:40.00]That was bad.
[210:40.52]I don't know.
[210:45.56]Oh, I did a crazy damage.
[210:50.31]Yeah, I'm a little bit further behind, so I think I'll be able to join Vinny eventually.
[211:03.44]Oh my.
[211:11.24]I better be getting experience for all these kills.
[211:13.54]Hey brother.
[211:27.27]That's a good thumbnail.
[211:33.74]But instead of the monster, put like a ton of menus all over and a bunch of like chancell to join and couldn't join group like pop-ups everywhere.
[211:43.34]Okay, I'm in the hunt of the alpha now.
[211:46.39]Now you can join.
[211:46.97]I hope.
[211:50.07]Are you sure he's going to pop up for him?
[211:54.95]I feel like he won't.
[211:57.16]Yeah, I don't see... Because that happened to me last time.
[212:05.03]I don't think I can join.
[212:05.95]Did you get Jerma's thing right now, or no?
[212:08.89]I can join you, Ster, weirdly enough.
[212:12.91]I forgot how to do the second part of the Charge Axe.
[212:16.54]You want us to join Ster, and we'll just two of you do it?
[212:19.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[212:20.50]Because I just hit it one time, it just gave me... I can join, I think.
[212:24.42]Alright, so do you want to... You're right, okay.
[212:28.03]No, I can only join Jerma.
[212:30.59]What the fuck?
[212:33.01]I can join Jerma.
[212:33.95]What are we doing?
[212:34.71]Oh, he's going to kill me, dude.
[212:36.79]Yeah, everybody join me.
[212:37.87]I'm the alpha.
[212:40.45]Vinny, do you want to join them or just kill it here?
[212:43.06]We're doing good.
[212:44.72]I'll join you, sir.
[212:46.14]Okay.
[212:46.66]Alright, 2v2.
[212:47.12]Is this the right quest?
[212:57.44]hunt the alpha alpha dog yep you sure you can't join mine yeah damn imagine if this were the first game we played together like as a group yeah yeah it'd be over
[213:24.94]Well, we've solidified how we feel about each other to a point where we can just chill and just do whatever.
[213:33.44]Yeah.
[213:34.94]Because right now I'd be like, oh, fuck.
[213:36.98]What do I say?
[213:37.44]I got to say something funny.
[213:38.32]I got to talk to somebody.
[213:40.26]I say the stupidest shit when I'm like hanging with you guys.
[213:43.24]So, yeah, there's no stress.
[213:45.85]I'll open up more.
[213:48.31]You'll get there eventually.
[213:52.93]I'm coming, Ster.
[213:58.47]there's no brain cells between them that's not fair there's a there's a load there's probably like 500 there's a lot there's a lot that's the link that the game talks about I like that one thanks man oh there's weak points here poke could do some damage with knees
[214:28.88]If anything, this shows the strength of our relationship.
[214:36.94]Especially when we get the Command and Conquer and have our watch eventually, and then repo.
[214:40.36]It could take a year, but we'll get there eventually.
[214:43.40]Really?
[214:55.81]Oh, you fucked up his eye.
[214:59.68]I'm on his back.
[215:07.99]We are doing this together.

[216:17.43]Yay, he did it.
[216:18.15]I know.
[216:21.39]He just picked words before I got to talk.

[223:16.49]That was kind of cool.
[223:34.00]How did I do that?
[223:40.88]Good.
[223:50.58]He's got a lot of help He just walks
[224:41.55]very nice these things are all hanging I thought he had horns for a second he's got fleas alright we got it that's it damn one hit I one hit him yeah I just was charging up with all the others whoa that is bright
[225:11.77]Time to lean back.
[225:12.95]Hunter ranked three.
[225:16.03]Guys, I think this is it for me.
[225:18.39]I want to get some dinner.
[225:21.57]I'm kind of hungry.
[225:23.80]Hungry.
[225:24.28]I got some other... I got to go do my other job now, which is music.
[225:32.54]Right?
[225:33.28]The food of the soul.
[225:34.62]The food of the soul.
[225:39.29]What are you doing with music today?
[225:40.37]Are you going to the studio?
[225:43.37]I am.
[225:44.01]I am, yeah.
[225:44.49]I'm going to work on some stuff.
[225:46.27]We're trying to finish up this album.
[225:48.63]Oh, nice.
[225:49.23]Ooh.
[225:50.89]You got a potential release date for it?
[225:54.35]I don't want to reveal too much, but I'm hoping this year for sure.
[225:58.75]I would like middle of year would be nice.
[226:00.73]That would be my goal.
[226:01.63]Oh, Q4?
[226:01.73]Q3?
[226:01.83]Q2 and a half.
[226:09.63]Can you send me the album?
[226:12.37]I can.
[226:12.81]Alright, cool.
[226:14.67]We'll find a way to make that be cool.
[226:16.70]Yeah.
[226:17.86]Alright.
[226:18.24]Yeah, I think we've done a lot.
[226:22.24]I think we have.
[226:25.98]Well, I love you, and I hope you hit those notes today.
[226:28.93]Thanks, buddy.
[226:29.53]You too.
[226:29.95]Yeah, thanks for playing.
[226:31.19]Honestly, man, I hope you hit them.
[226:32.83]You did it.
[226:36.37]It was fun.
[226:36.95]I know we had some frustrations with the co-op and the crashing, and truthfully, this game is going above and beyond to be cinematic.
[226:46.58]But when we were fighting monsters, the shit was awesome.
[226:50.41]When it works, it's sick.
[226:51.95]We'll do that again sometime.
[226:53.05]That'll be really cool.
[226:54.35]The actual gameplay loop is really, really, really fun.
[226:57.27]You have to just get there first.
[227:00.20]Yeah.
[227:01.85]Alright.
[227:02.27]Well, this was great hanging with you guys as always.
[227:04.55]We got plenty of other games we could play in the future, but I'll be in touch.
[227:08.89]Have a good one.
[227:09.55]And if you guys want to make progress, feel free.
[227:11.61]Like, just go ahead, enjoy.
[227:14.13]So, don't worry about me.
[227:16.15]Can I invite you guys?
[227:19.15]Yeah, take it easy.
[227:19.97]Thanks for hanging out.
[227:20.77]Alright, I'll see you later.
[227:22.49]Good to see you.
[227:23.17]Bye, guys.
[227:24.03]Bye.
[227:26.17]So, what do you gamers think?
[227:27.83]Are you done with this or do you want to keep going?
[227:31.29]I'll do whatever I'll keep playing oh yeah I don't know how I feel like that might have been one of the last cinematic thingies and it might get easier but I don't want to go too far ahead of Vinny if he wants to play more but I also it's hard to organize so I mean we could just tell him continue to this point true right if it gets better then it's way better for all of us he just gets to it yeah
[227:59.25]so we can keep going I'm good for a little while I uh I do want to take a pee break though I hope you hit those notes I mean realistically if we play a different game it'd be worse right because then we miss out on Vinny on a new game true there's the villagers oh good the livestock's safe
[228:26.24]Everyone should just play at their own pace to reach the high rank, then you can really get the most out of the co-op.
[228:33.50]Seems to be the case, doesn't it?
[228:34.46]I gotta make some more potions.
[228:35.36]This guy and his potions.
[228:58.88]you guys make armor yet or no I'd say now is probably the time to start doing it if you haven't done it because that monster hit very hard hey maybe your your meal bonus wore off you guys this is where food is eating food true true that's a good important speaking of food I'm gonna get like a piece of chicken out of the fridge I'll be back
[229:27.56]Oh, the winds.
[229:28.46]Thank the winds.
[229:30.10]Does it matter to increase sheathing speed?
[229:32.40]Only if you use the katana.
[229:35.30]Yeah, I'll be right back, guys.
[229:36.92]I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[229:38.36]Do I have enough time for like an ad break, maybe?
[229:44.22]Yeah, let's do an ad break.
[229:45.92]I'll be back in like three minutes, four minutes.
[229:47.34]I want to stretch a little bit more.
[229:48.26]I haven't gotten up that much.
[229:49.12]I'll be right back after this cutscene.
[229:55.18]I got 12 new titles.
[229:56.70]They can call me anything.
[229:59.16]Pre-rolls have been on all day.
[230:01.34]They have.
[230:02.08]And I just ask and answer that question in my own head, out loud.
[230:08.39]Yeah, honestly, I think we... tried to set up co-op longer than we played, and it wouldn't take too long to get to where we are.
[230:23.46]I just can't believe it's like this.
[230:26.73]know is there anything we can offer you it is definitely not um we belong to an organization it's not intuitive I would say it is the opposite of that my friends and I are on an expedition to find the village of the keepers we would be grateful if you would allow us to speak to the people here and gather information
[230:49.53]I'm ready to just keep going, honestly.
[230:51.41]I feel pretty strong.
[230:53.31]Yeah, it'll grab you.
[230:57.54]The game is very fun.
[230:59.68]It just needs to get you.
[231:01.18]And it sounds like it might be getting us.
[231:03.34]Alright, I'll be right back.
[231:06.42]Okay.
[231:14.63]May they aid you in your journey.
[231:26.62]I'm so happy you're all safe!
[231:29.96]Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
[231:32.42]We've been worried about you since you left.
[231:36.95]See?
[231:37.91]Told you they'd be fine.
[231:48.23]You saved me... ...I can't thank you enough!
[231:58.55]Nice to cross one problem off the list.
[232:01.73]Speaking of which... ...Natta... ...did you and Astrum Unit have any luck with your investigation?
[232:06.66]Uh huh... ...we found this place deep in the forest with lots of water... ...and nearby were some drag marks...
[232:15.60]I remember that the White Wraith had something dragging from its arms.
[232:20.89]So maybe it's what left those marks.
[232:24.61]Yeah.
[232:26.31]You might just be onto something.
[232:27.99]I think we should travel to the forest base camp together.
[232:31.73]Better safe than sorry.
[232:36.68]Let's go.
[232:37.50]We've got Sacred to deliver.
[232:40.32]Let me know when you're ready to go.
[232:42.12]I'll be waiting for you at the plains base camp.
[233:05.75]Thank you.
[234:04.07]Oh, I forgot to do the screen.
[234:11.49]I, like, went BRB, but forgot to go BRB.
[234:16.37]Oh, my God.
[234:25.92]I just ate a piece of chicken fast and it hurt.
[234:29.96]Don't eat food fast.
[234:31.68]Bad.
[234:31.88]Don't do that.
[235:13.83]alright I am good how we doing how you guys doing just thinking about armors like a second weapon and what kind of armor to get
[235:30.69]yeah different monsters as we keep going here they'll be this one is water or fire damage this one is lightning and lots of gear is obviously to defend against certain types um I'm I'm down the quest path you talk to a guy and then they take you to the forest yeah no it's all like it's all conversations a lot of conversations okay
[236:29.27]you capture a lizard tail?
[236:35.82]Sorry, there's a quest.
[236:37.90]They're talking about her uncle's horrible white thing.
[236:44.42]What were you saying?
[236:45.60]Did you capture a lizard tail or no?
[236:48.63]Capture lizard tail.
[236:49.85]I don't think so.
[236:50.31]Okay, never mind.
[236:50.85]Am I in the wrong camp?
[237:03.13]I don't know you think I'm supposed to know where you are it's the kid right there didn't I talk to the kid already this is the base camp right
[237:31.43]Oh, it's this kid here.
[237:38.46]For some reason, I thought this was outside.
[237:39.72]Hmm.
[237:59.00]I'll never get used to seeing this guy's face ever.
[238:24.82]have you seen Olivia and Eric we have sacred from kunafa village for them nope been a bit since I saw them did they leave to investigate the white wraith perhaps ah right got a little they did tell me they were heading out seeing going here damn for a little bit in the forest shall we go deliver those can I come I'll pass
[238:54.59]The damage should be this way.
[239:05.84]I think the other the other boys are we're doing the same thing, just kind of getting through it until we get to the next point of traces.
[239:12.84]Did you find in the forest?
[239:15.62]There were marks on the ground.
[239:18.90]The Wraith was dragging something when it attacked our village.
[239:24.51]I got a quest invitation.
[239:28.54]Quest invitation, really?
[239:30.28]Will it work?
[239:32.26]Good question.
[239:33.16]Uh-oh, this one has armor or something.
[239:37.46]Watch out, guys.
[239:38.03]This one's a water type.
[239:39.79]Are we joining Pope?
[239:41.51]Pope sent me a quest invitation.
[239:43.49]I'm trying to join.
[239:44.03]I'm getting hit.
[239:44.61]I'm trying to join the Ster.
[239:45.93]I accidentally climbed.
[239:47.17]Hold on.
[239:47.53]I don't...
[239:52.28]A downpour like this could have an effect.
[239:54.22]The way you join your teammates is insane.
[239:56.40]We should all be extra careful.
[239:58.48]Come here.
[239:58.80]I got your game stirred.
[239:59.88]Yeah, let's hurry.
[240:01.50]Okay, I'm hiding.
[240:02.30]Did I just accept an invitation to be your friend?
[240:08.32]An SOS flare.
[240:09.52]I did send a friend request earlier.
[240:11.77]You didn't have to accept that.
[240:13.15]Let's go.
[240:18.57]This is Astra Munich we're talking about.
[240:23.36]Uh, Poke joined me.
[240:24.16]Can you join me, Jerma?
[240:25.72]Can you join me?
[240:26.09]I probably have to see the monster.
[240:29.01]I know.
[240:56.90]I'll have to run 600 meters to you by the way
[241:24.63]Nata!
[241:25.09]Help!
[241:26.45]No!
[241:26.89]That's not the monster!
[241:31.46]This is its territory.
[241:33.28]And we're intruders.
[241:35.30]I'll draw its attention!
[241:36.99]You take Eric and run!
[241:58.05]I'm on his back.
[241:58.69]I'm stabbing him.
[242:04.43]OK, let's do this thing.
[242:12.75]He brought a friend.
[242:13.55]He brought Olivia.
[242:16.94]Does every monster have a cutscene?
[242:21.10]They all feel like they're so important.
[242:22.49]I want one not to have a cutscene.
[242:24.59]I want it to be huge too.
[242:35.47]Why would you want that?
[242:37.35]Yeah.
[242:37.65]You're freaked.
[242:52.16]Have you been using them?
[242:54.28]Yeah, I can craft some more but I did the thing right there It's gonna go back you sound angry It's the bush light I need to have another fucking bush light honestly
[243:20.41]you believe this guy started at 2 a.m he's still going 3 a.m yesterday by the way I've only just now had to start the potion on like the last two guys
[243:50.31]That might be the our like mega food bonus for off and we need like an actual meal I'm strong Alright, um, I could get I guess I gotta get potions maybe Oh wait, I'm dead I'm strong So much bullshit
[244:27.06]Oh, he's gone.
[244:32.78]What the heck?
[244:34.42]Oh, he went out of bounds.
[244:35.56]He's out of bounds.
[244:38.89]Gotta go around.
[244:41.35]He's doing a glitch.
[244:42.59]He's doing a glitch.
[244:45.41]That little wall blocked us?
[244:46.93]Alright.
[244:48.17]How many rations?
[244:48.89]I don't think I even have any.
[244:55.00]Oh.
[245:03.71]whoa whoa whoa whoa or do you miss some ore I don't need it I don't have a canoe hopefully I'm going the right direction I think we got to drop this wood on it
[245:43.81]Oh shit.
[245:45.15]Owned!
[245:47.85]Alright, I made it.
[245:48.37]Does the monster have 8% HP left?
[245:50.53]Yeah, 8.
[245:50.95]I crushed it.
[245:51.49]Ouch.
[245:51.95]That's pain.
[246:15.88]I don't like that mountain dew
[246:29.59]Ben, this is destroying my computer with ray tracing on every single ripple I can see my own face.
[246:35.26]Do you have ray tracing turned on?
[246:37.48]No.
[246:37.66]I was going to say, how are you getting such good frames per second?
[246:43.84]I just lie and say things.
[246:45.02]I'm sorry.
[246:47.18]You think you're able to pull here?
[246:51.51]I'll turn it off.
[247:01.34]Okay, I'm starting to be a full-time potioner.
[247:05.55]I'm not the settings guy.
[247:21.40]This is why Ginny left.
[247:24.40]He was scared.
[247:28.79]Ow.
[247:30.28]Make sure you guys have mega potions.
[247:34.10]Yeah, now I'm doing my whetstone.
[247:39.12]You guys have fun.
[247:49.22]Is this armor showing up because we need to upgrade our weapons more or what?
[247:53.06]I think it's just armor.
[247:54.56]Maybe it's resistant to the type of damage that we're doing in certain places.
[247:57.86]Maybe it's armored on the back.
[247:58.78]Do you get iframes when you roll?
[248:05.05]I don't think so.
[248:07.75]I'm starting to feel like if you're in the air on Insect Glaive, you get hit by every attack even if it's nowhere near you.
[248:17.21]And it does a lot of damage.
[248:22.70]You're even.
[248:23.18]Hi.
[248:24.06]We'll drive it off.
[248:34.77]Me trying to do the auto run in my thing just goes into a wall.
[248:40.91]That's actually crazy that you can do that though.
[248:46.05]Don't let him sleep.
[248:46.79]The more he sleeps, more HP gains.
[248:50.30]I'm gonna get on his back.
[248:56.21]Never mind.
[249:10.75]Oh.
[249:46.32]You just like cut his face off?
[249:55.62]I'm glaiving.
[249:56.66]I'm killing.
[249:57.62]I'm killing.
[249:58.10]I killed.
[249:58.56]Okay.
[250:15.41]Would even get the material.
[250:18.03]I can't believe Magikarp's turn into that.
[250:22.27]Time to go, right?
[250:26.60]Like a dog park roof.
[250:35.64]Olivia.
[250:39.55]Sylvia!
[250:40.73]Were you able to subdue it?
[250:41.83]Wait, you didn't skip?
[250:43.67]Oh.
[250:44.51]Are we watching this together?
[250:45.89]Like a movie, or?
[250:47.64]I skipped because you make me feel weird.
[250:50.26]Skip.
[250:50.50]Oh.
[250:51.70]Well, now I don't know what's happening.
[250:52.88]You're cutscene watching.
[250:53.80]I don't know.
[250:54.30]You're cutscene watching.
[250:57.50]Guys.
[250:59.69]Ja?
[251:02.57]Ja?
[251:04.35]Oh, this is... You missed some pretty wacky shit.
[251:06.73]You skipped the cutscene.
[251:08.47]Can you say it to us in full detail?
[251:12.01]This lightning monster just grabbed the thing we were fighting and is sucking its life force out.
[251:20.16]Uh-oh.
[251:22.46]Thank you.
[251:23.08]Yeah, I feel like that was an important cutscene.
[251:29.64]And it made me feel weird about making him feel weird.
[251:31.72]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[251:33.70]I think we're going to see a main character death, by the way.
[251:37.88]this there's a main character we'll see is it me no it ran away too I don't with this Eric guy same Eric I don't trust them alright here's a challenge don't look at your screen don't look at your chat name one person in the game
[252:07.68]Eric, Alma, Jenna.
[252:11.06]Not Eric.
[252:12.14]Tim, Jack.
[252:13.84]Did you say Jack?
[252:19.44]Yeah, I'll point you to Jack right now.
[252:22.34]There's a Jack?
[252:24.04]Yeah, he's right in the main town.
[252:27.88]If you look around, there's a Jack, I swear.
[252:29.60]Right here.
[252:31.44]No, that's Ralph.
[252:33.09]What the hell?
[252:35.58]there's a Ralph well there's nothing for us here let's head back to base camp wait could you give me some time to investigate what it was doing here yeah I feel like there's some there's probably weapon upgrades and stuff that I've been skipping jail hammer yeah whenever we go back to the actual camp when you're there oh yeah we can make chatacabra armor now
[253:04.69]So we'd have to go kill Chattacabra probably a few times.
[253:09.03]Is any of you longsword?
[253:09.89]No.
[253:12.40]I was going to do greatsword.
[253:13.50]I'm going to make a longsword just to try it.
[253:17.62]Wait, katanas?
[253:21.60]Whoa.
[253:22.36]Oh, I like the spider armor because it would make me look like a vampire and I was trying to be a vampire.
[253:26.74]You know what I'm saying?
[253:32.06]Whatever your heart wants.
[253:33.72]I mean, I want that.
[253:34.88]But how do we actually go fight things as a group?
[253:39.80]Just do it on the board?
[253:40.68]Yeah, is there any specific one that you guys want to kill?
[253:44.75]What does a minus affinity do?
[253:56.65]um I think that's like resistances to certain things we can agree that the monster that crashed our hunt was indeed the white brick we can also report that it increases the amount of honey you get oh what a cool vampire armor honey goes straight to my pocket here a bit longer good luck what we got here
[254:29.81]alright yeah I would recommend getting some new upgrades if you don't have them getting new upgrades so when you go to the upgrade list wait no this whole thing exists to perplex
[255:06.11]Ooh, water.
[255:06.99]I'll stick with the fire.
[255:17.84]It's been good so far.
[255:38.52]Anything catch your eye?
[255:39.68]Ready to get to work?
[255:56.55]All righty.
[255:58.81]Perfection.
[255:59.61]There you are.
[256:14.29]I feel like I just evolved the clothes I had on.
[256:19.96]You... I don't... I don't know.
[256:21.94]I don't... I can't answer that question completely, but I don't think you can.
[256:48.62]Ready to get to work?
[256:50.80]All righty.
[256:51.52]Perfection.
[256:54.28]Yes, you can.
[256:55.02]The defense, you can.
[256:57.54]You can only upgrade armor way later.
[256:59.18]Oh, you can't for lower ones?
[257:02.18]I guess not.
[257:09.17]What is group skills?
[257:12.45]I'm ready to work.
[257:16.07]All righty.
[257:19.70]Oh, it's like a set bonus.
[257:32.56]You get fire resistance cool.
[257:39.91]Oh, that's good.
[257:53.59]I don't think the Duna set is for me.
[257:55.37]Wait, what is peak performance?
[258:03.85]Oh wait, that's actually pretty sick.
[258:05.28]Oh, health is full.
[258:12.72]Yeah, your crafting menu will have just everything you can make.
[258:22.09]A lot of stuff is very, very good.
[258:23.19]Actually the potions, the herbal medicine.
[258:33.48]I think you learn.
[258:35.59]Yeah, I definitely want some of these energy drinks.
[259:07.88]I need to make some food too.
[259:09.86]Fuck.
[259:10.24]Cool.
[259:39.34]Alright, do you want to post up one of those missions and we'll just go kill another one of these things?
[259:48.10]Yeah, how do we get an aquasack?
[259:52.21]Aquasack?
[259:54.19]Maybe from the thing we just killed?
[260:13.75]Where is?
[260:19.98]What's her name?
[260:20.46]Where is she?
[260:22.86]Like the quest board, right?
[260:24.74]Oh, we have to.
[260:25.30]I think we have to finish this.
[260:26.42]Whatever it is.
[260:27.66]The wood woods.
[260:31.02]Are you guys doing?
[260:31.64]Did you guys do the wood woods?
[260:34.08]I'm doing it now.
[260:35.34]I think the wood woods.
[260:37.13]Yeah, alright, let's go then.
[260:40.51]The wood woods.
[260:45.07]Valahara has the Aqua Sack.
[260:46.59]I think that's the snake kind of worm one.
[260:57.46]Oh yeah, no, I had to.
[260:58.72]I did have to check Kinsack.
[261:00.98]Whoops.
[261:02.76]Well, I'm I'm going to the wood wood woo woo.
[261:11.68]Sorry, did that hurt you?
[261:13.47]you took Sonic damage?
[261:15.59]yeah I took I'm taking actual damage on that one that wasn't real the whole time make sure you're eating good steak too because your bar might be depleting yeah watch out for your bar
[261:46.68]What did that just want me to do?
[261:47.88]What?
[261:50.42]Capture net?
[261:51.20]Okay, hold on.
[261:51.94]Yeah, I'm exactly where you are and I'm equally as confused.
[261:58.14]So you set the net and then... Yeah, you can catch bugs and stuff.
[262:05.45]I see.
[262:06.53]I don't care.
[262:07.29]Why give me dialogue options?
[262:08.35]Okay.
[262:17.19]I can't do it with a mouse.
[262:21.11]What am I doing?
[262:27.76]He hates RP.
[262:28.76]It's not even RP.
[262:29.70]It's just the same three answers.
[262:32.22]Just have him go, yes.
[262:34.12]I don't care.
[262:34.64]Yes.
[262:36.22]That's what my character sounds like.
[262:40.26]Mine too.
[262:40.68]That's why I'm doing it.
[262:41.49]I get you.
[262:45.95]So they care about immersion, but my character, you know, you have seriously three out of ten.
[262:51.51]That was so not are you left?
[263:02.65]I might be my favorite site today.
[263:06.33]Well, the net.
[263:08.45]I mean, it teaches me how to throw the net.
[263:11.11]It says, hey, throw the net at this stuff.
[263:12.95]And then it goes, hey, pick one of these three dialogue options now.
[263:17.45]I think the net just changes what your zoom in and hook does.
[263:25.12]I don't know.
[263:26.00]I just ate enough to have been eating steak.
[263:28.56]Oh, my God.
[263:29.14]I'm going to fucking freak out.
[263:32.71]I just ate all my food.
[263:42.29]rtx just makes the game glowy there should be like a Pokémon snap during these uh movement sections we get to throw the apple and all of that actually we have a few questions if that's alright instead it's just your item pouches full messages
[264:09.33]A monster with chain-like appendages.
[264:11.61]You probably have a full inventory.
[264:14.63]Dump that stuff in your box at either camp or at your home.
[264:20.76]Nay, none of us had eyes for such things.
[264:24.32]Not while we are preoccupied with honey basking.
[264:30.96]Well, nobody saw anything.
[264:34.20]The trail has gone cold.
[264:38.20]Huh?
[264:44.15]We ran into each other near base camp so my unit offered to accompany them on the road
[265:09.02]We keep getting reaction shots of this kid.
[265:34.11]I feel like the camera's been on this kid's face for half of the dialogue.
[265:40.33]They just really want to see what he has to think about it.
[265:42.33]Borderlands?
[265:43.27]Let's do Borderlands.
[265:43.91]Um...
[266:02.91]The New Batch, or whatever it's called.
[266:04.31]The New Batch?
[266:16.14]That's Gremlins.
[266:17.06]Oh, well, whatever.
[266:20.44]Let's watch Gremlins 2.
[266:21.18]That sounds good.
[266:22.12]Okay.
[266:35.01]Am I enjoying the game yet when I get to play?
[266:43.85]Why do they keep putting us on these long rides?
[266:47.46]Yeah, I would definitely say that.
[266:53.07]I don't remember this in World.
[266:55.63]I don't remember kind of ride in the caravan with the people and talk for 10 minutes.
[267:01.09]Maybe I'm wrong, though.
[267:03.45]I mean, it's been a while.
[267:04.26]I don't remember it being like this.
[267:05.58]Yeah.
[267:08.36]I never played Rise.
[267:12.94]Rise is the one before this, right?
[267:14.80]I think so, yeah.
[267:19.34]Didn't the one before this one have, like, um... You could build with wood blocks and everything that had, like, sails on them?
[267:27.89]Uh... Yeah.
[267:28.17]Yeah, Monster Hunter Wild Hearts?
[267:29.73]Oh, that was Wild Hearts.
[267:33.53]That's right.
[267:49.83]Don't fall from your perch now.
[267:52.78]It's fine.
[267:53.54]Actually, I didn't.
[267:54.84]I didn't hate that game.
[267:55.80]I actually played it a little bit more off stream.
[267:57.78]It was fun.
[268:05.26]Type squeeze.
[268:07.52]This paired with the bridge must be effective at keeping large monsters out.
[268:13.91]Skip we are nearly to the Everforge Azusa.
[268:23.66]I've had that happen a few times in real life.
[268:25.29]I just hold to skip a conversation and then like suddenly I'm fighting a dragon.
[268:29.65]Yeah, same.
[268:34.82]dude one time I was laying in bed and I was watching something on my iPad and I was really tired and I may have I may have smoked weed and I uh I want what I was trying to do is I was trying to you know like go full screen oh this put this video into full screen I was trying to make the video that I was seeing on my iPad fill up my entire vision full screen

[269:07.37]The glasses I was talking about, they do that.
[269:11.25]True.
[269:14.83]Like, the space around the iPad, like, the bed and the room and the bureau behind it, I wanted to get rid of that.
[269:21.86]I wanted to full screen the iPad image into my view.
[269:29.18]Weed goggles, they call it?
[269:30.28]Yeah.

[271:21.45]I didn't even tell everybody about it.
[271:24.11]Nor do I know how to do it.
[271:36.62]I don't... Hmm.
[271:45.54]I want to go check out this Everforge myself.
[271:47.48]No, make him the pop-up camp.

[271:52.17]Wait, if I make a pop-up camp and I join your thing?
[271:57.03]He's held the position for a long time.
[271:59.15]I don't know.
[271:59.69]Countless years.
[272:01.05]There's a cutscene right down the hill if you don't make the pop-up camp.
[272:05.02]Yeah, I started it.
[272:05.90]That's why.

[276:07.02]I wish you could send me to the moon with it.
[276:09.28]Does that just keep hitting them?
[276:13.26]I don't know.

[277:36.56]I'm about to see Ron Popolo and I'm missing out on all the fun things you guys are doing.
[277:41.80]No, we're standing still waiting for you.
[277:43.52]You guys killed Popolo?
[277:49.94]No, we're waiting for you.
[277:53.07]Like someone abandoned it while they were in a hurry.
[277:56.59]They couldn't have gone far.
[277:57.63]Let's keep searching.
[277:58.87]We're just staring at Pompalo.
[278:07.54]I lost my glasses in the sludge.
[278:10.88]Not getting those back.
[278:15.53]Vermi, you join me?

[278:38.80]I apologize.
[278:40.96]He looks into the camera?
[278:44.28]Sir, why do we cut scenes?
[278:45.18]Why do we cut scenes, bro?
[278:46.80]Why do we skip?
[278:49.28]I watched it.
[278:51.15]I watched it and I'm still here before him 10 minutes.
[278:53.47]Right.
[278:57.45]All stars fall.
[278:58.99]RuPaul's Popolo?

[279:11.20]Okay.
[279:27.88]I am joining.
[279:28.54]I am almost in.
[279:29.54]The rompo below is a brute wyvern that favors clumpy terrain.
[279:41.88]Alright, on my way.
[279:43.76]As it stores up and expels, has poison and explosive properties.
[279:47.34]Stay clear of it.
[279:57.11]poke where are you right outside this area in the back it pop a load all the way up to a different level wait you you've been fighting him no it just walked very far away oh he's raised right here I'm coming I'm trying to tell you what pop a load what is exhaust
[280:27.82]I need a new chair yeah?
[280:33.59]any recommendations on a chair?
[280:36.57]I wish every chair has let me down and I've tried some weird ones we should sell a chair we're selling a chair now too right?
[280:47.50]we should get into the chair business I feel like I could probably come up with a pretty good chair you game on a couch
[280:56.59]That's what I'm saying.
[280:58.63]Like, I'm not looking for a couch.
[281:02.79]Yeah, but I know, I understand comfort.
[281:11.33]Yo, check this out.
[281:12.21]Alright, Jerma, I'll let you comfort me.
[281:15.18]Oh, it's poison.
[281:16.06]Jerma, bring it to me.
[281:18.60]What are you doing?
[281:20.42]He's winding it up.
[281:23.90]Oh.
[281:26.83]All I hear when your character does that is, you motherfucker, you're going to get fucking smashed with this fucking thing.
[281:33.13]That's all I hear.
[281:40.96]I feel like I've been out of the game for so long, I have to remember how to play the game again.
[281:46.40]I'm on top of the Popolo.
[281:47.98]What do you mean?
[281:49.68]I'm Popoling.
[281:58.39]I'm popling in the wrong direction.
[282:14.09]Your character's voice is fucking awful.
[282:19.11]Oh, I know.
[282:19.67]I know.
[282:21.37]Especially with how often you attack with the Insect Glaze.
[282:25.55]It's so weak!
[282:27.78]I thought you were exaggerating, but that is truly abysmal.
[282:30.82]I would remake my character.
[282:33.73]I'm kind of jiving with it.
[282:54.00]This dude is looting and we're not even done.
[283:07.93]Dude, I'm glaiving.
[283:08.86]Wait, Jeremy, you're dead?
[283:12.02]Oh, I'm what?
[283:16.76]Oh.
[283:20.15]I'm poisoned.
[283:23.75]Oh, that hurt.
[283:26.17]Oh, get me up.
[283:26.67]Right in the head.
[283:35.06]Big damage.
[283:40.35]Do I need the antidote?
[283:43.26]Yeah I think we're killing him though.
[283:54.63]I don't think anyone needs the antidote.
[283:57.62]We're doing pretty good
[284:17.40]It's a long time to drink the antidote
[284:53.00]This was actually really good.
[284:58.86]Was it?
[284:59.70]Yeah.
[285:00.84]Grab these bones.
[285:05.72]Great job.
[285:06.80]I've noticed like every single armor set needs a bone.
[285:12.94]Actually, they can be hard to find too.
[285:14.76]Oh, a mystery bone.
[285:18.12]It could be any kind of
[285:30.18]What?
[285:39.92]Ooh, good hit.
[285:40.92]I wonder if he can pop the, like, sac on his butt.
[285:55.96]That sounded disgusting.
[285:57.96]Like a zit.
[285:59.82]That was gross, wasn't it?
[286:01.56]I'd pop it.
[286:04.30]Oh, I got a Wex Tome.
[286:06.90]Like, it sounded personal.
[286:14.77]Ooh, yep.
[286:16.03]I think we popped it.
[286:21.53]Ooh!
[286:24.81]Nice.
[286:32.94]Oh no, it's running.
[286:35.03]Look at these bones.
[286:38.49]These old bones.
[286:40.24]Make sure you get all these bones.
[286:42.86]Yeah, I want these too.
[286:43.96]Good call.
[286:45.12]This is why it keeps healing, guys.
[286:48.63]We need this stuff.
[287:06.45]I cannot take the eyes off the bug butt this dude is eating mud oh shit what the hell uh I think this is like what do they call it charro beans or no or totally other completely different thing
[287:44.09]far away I still like try to figure out how you reliably land on their back it's not just like a jump like just sometimes you don't grab yeah apparently it's random
[288:14.26]Right in the head, do it.
[288:15.00]Ooh, this is going to be big.
[288:19.43]I feel like I never run out of stamina.
[288:30.48]Yeah, me neither.
[288:33.74]Only when I'm like climbing on it does it ever seem to matter.
[288:36.22]Wait, I'm going to switch to greatsword.
[288:46.79]Nice.
[288:50.82]Oh, the green sword hit is what got it.
[288:52.68]You saw that?
[288:58.86]Very nice.
[289:00.22]That was cool, though.
[289:01.52]Get everything quick.
[289:02.30]It's a magic.
[289:03.66]It's a magic.
[289:10.73]And that, my friends, is how you slay a Rom Pompolo.
[289:15.64]What's up, YouTube?
[289:16.96]That was the very end of the E3 trailer.
[289:20.74]You look in the camera and you say it.
[289:25.36]I hate when E3 has the fake comms.
[289:29.88]It's one of my favorite things.
[289:31.10]They stopped doing it as much.
[289:33.20]Also, they stopped doing E3 five years ago, but besides that... Whoa, look at this place, Jim.
[289:40.20]Holy shit.
[289:41.50]Don't you feel like you do that, though?
[289:43.92]I feel like I do that.
[289:45.56]They have like the worst mic though.
[289:48.54]I guess it's normal.
[289:50.36]I definitely walked around and been like, oh, hey, what's that?
[289:53.58]Oh, chat, what's going on there?
[289:55.06]And then I go, fuck that.
[289:56.46]I'm not doing that anymore.
[289:57.80]I do that.
[290:00.28]I always think of the Anthem one because it had one of the worst.
[290:03.90]I think of the Division.
[290:04.68]Yeah, Jerma, your game is bugged.
[290:07.53]You're not getting shit.
[290:11.68]Okay, but focus strikes.
[290:13.48]I don't think I can do a focus strike.
[290:14.94]I have a bow.
[290:16.95]Well, then you should get the award for most bow attacks or something.
[290:21.57]Can you just pay attention?
[290:27.75]It's R1?
[290:28.59]I skipped.
[290:34.29]I don't know why.
[290:34.81]Oh, man.
[290:37.28]Don't skip.
[290:37.70]Don't skip.
[290:43.03]Whoa, this cutscene is amazing.
[290:44.49]They put all the budget into this.
[290:47.69]Whatever happened to a good old pair of pantaloons?
[291:07.18]They still make them.
[291:07.72]This is all my fault.
[291:09.68]I'm sorry.
[291:10.24]Oh, lighten up.
[291:12.42]I'll be fine.
[291:13.18]I can't wait to see the boss's face.
[291:15.97]He'll get it.
[291:23.33]On our way, then.
[291:28.85]So, what's your story, friends?
[291:31.85]We came here looking for you.
[291:33.07]The chief told us what happened.
[291:37.71]If I ever make a video game at the end of a mission like this, some goofy motherfucker is just gonna be standing there pointing in a direction and you can't even talk to him and you just go that way.
[291:59.10]Can we direct one?
[292:01.36]What's that?
[292:02.82]Can we direct a game?
[292:06.15]I've always wanted to make one.
[292:07.45]I know they're like impossible to make and they take so much time and effort, but I've always thought it'd be fun just to make a shitty one for fun.
[292:12.39]We have to leave.
[292:12.73]Hey chat, make me a game.
[292:40.90]Yeah, the candle.
[292:41.66]The candle is out right now.
[292:42.38]I didn't even realize it was released.
[292:44.28]I think the developer wanted me to record some lines but...
[293:03.91]I don't know.
[293:05.13]It's difficult to... Especially if somebody's charging money for something.
[293:10.22]I don't know.
[293:17.90]Is that supposed to happen?
[293:19.84]Did you?
[293:20.20]I never heard that.
[293:21.72]I barely dream.
[293:23.80]I barely dream ever.
[293:25.20]Whenever I dream, it's like some... I always die.
[293:27.68]Do you wake up when you die?
[293:29.74]Yeah.
[293:31.56]What about your 7%?
[293:33.35]Oh, it's not about that.
[293:34.15]It's just about... I mean, I want to like play it and see what it's all about.
[293:42.13]Because if I'm like, hey guys, here it is, the candle.
[293:45.20]And there I am.
[293:46.06]I'm in the game.
[293:47.10]And what if like the game's like fucked up or something?
[293:50.52]Not saying that's the case.
[293:51.30]I'm just saying that that would be pretty goofy.
[293:55.97]I definitely want to play it first.
[293:57.55]It looks fucking pretty good.
[293:59.67]It looks actually pretty well made, so I want to check it out first.
[294:02.01]I really feel like you're in it, but the dreams didn't get more interesting.
[294:06.97]They stayed just as boring.
[294:08.57]I remember one of them was I was in a theater waiting for a show to start for about two hours, and it never started, and I'm just sitting in the crowd waiting.
[294:17.89]I mean, yeah, sometimes I get a really boring dream.
[294:20.53]Sorry about this, travelers.
[294:23.21]I got a really, like a bad stream.
[294:28.84]Like I just played a boring game.
[294:30.06]Do you ever look at your chat in your dream?
[294:34.36]I don't remember, but I think I did.
[294:36.20]I have quite a few times.
[294:37.36]I'm like, I wonder what chat thinks.
[294:38.62]What just happened?
[294:39.20]And I look at a chat scrolling by.
[294:40.44]Chat, this stream is crazy.
[294:41.36]Chat, is this real?
[294:43.26]See, with the glasses, you could have chat.
[294:58.31]I've had dreams where it's implied that I'm streaming, but I'm not.
[295:02.51]But I still... Chat doesn't exist, but I'm apparently being shown to more people.
[295:10.51]It's like my numbers go up and it's like, whoa, damn, holy shit, like 50,000 viewers?
[295:15.44]But there's no chat.
[295:17.34]And I'm doing something horrible and embarrassing myself in front of more people.
[295:22.58]Oh, so many times I'll think I'm being watched in bed.
[295:29.44]Like I'm like waking up but it's like I think the camera's looking at me and I'm like oh fuck and I'll move my uh sheet so that I can't see my like ass or some shit.
[295:41.49]Like I'm like oh fuck but then it'll take me like five minutes to like actually realize I'm not live.
[295:45.98]I'm just sleeping.
[295:46.86]Does that make sense?
[295:48.06]It does yeah.
[295:52.71]you ever dream a orange big orange flaming orb watching you?
[295:58.48]uh Lord of the Rings?
[295:59.22]kinda yeah no yeah no I can't say that specifically has happened I will keep an eye out for the eye be aware it could be around
[296:22.16]You guys should play Voices of the Void.
[296:23.98]Just going to have to fix it.
[296:27.36]I highly recommend it.
[296:30.18]It seems really cool.
[296:32.28]Yeah, I think I should.
[296:33.70]I think I should just do it.
[296:35.28]You guys should just invest, like go in knowing nothing.
[296:37.60]That's the thing is, I think I've seen too much from other people playing it.
[296:43.68]I see.
[296:44.38]Yeah, but I feel like the more you play, there's so much slow burn.
[296:47.88]I mean, it's still getting updates, right?
[296:50.46]Yeah.
[296:51.10]Maybe wait for the next one.
[296:52.51]yeah maybe like the next one or two big ones and I'll do it but it's I feel like it's one of the greatest things ever honestly everything I heard about it sounds like people love it like really love it so what what if that's right one day comes back how does it look like you play like a scary game and you're like why are they ever why they ever not like scare you like smart like direction of the stuff like that maybe do spookier that game doesn't this time
[297:23.27]I've seen a few clips of you playing it and others playing it I don't really know what's going on I just kind of see you fiddling with knobs sounds like we're all going back oh yeah oh you would love it man uh you really would especially because you haven't seen like more than the knob fiddling but you really love a game that is like the most mundane task you can think of in real life
[297:52.57]But this game is that, and then there's also more.
[297:54.81]There's like other parts to the video game.
[297:57.07]Yeah, you just sit there fiddling knobs, talk to chat, and then once in a while something weird will happen.
[298:04.06]That seems kind of fun.
[298:05.98]It's really fun.
[298:07.48]Put it on the list.
[298:11.83]Alright, are we opening the quest board?
[298:13.33]What are we doing here?
[298:14.09]I would love to watch you play that.
[298:15.87]Yeah, I'm in a weird cutscene right now.
[298:22.51]They're like upset that dragons are fighting I don't know And we're not letting this child die and they're upset about it Yeah, if you like the digging the whole game it's like that on crack I
[298:53.08]Oh, I love that game.
[298:54.32]It's fun.
[298:54.62]Yeah.
[298:54.76]There's no digging, but anyways.
[298:56.86]This dragon's crazy.
[298:57.62]I feel like today we were sponsored.
[299:00.24]I mean, with a comment like, yo, this dragon's crazy.
[299:19.64]Like, I didn't want to be mean about the game earlier.
[299:24.69]Yeah, you're holding back a little.
[299:28.33]Whoa, did you see that shit?
[299:30.43]The game has a big community.
[299:32.09]I get it, but it's just like... I would say Monster Hunter, especially when you get to the higher ranks and the game opens up and... I actually 100% agree.
[299:43.72]I 100% agree.
[299:44.60]It's just...
[299:46.73]The first five hours of... Imagine you buy it with your friend, like, hey, let's just play this game.
[299:51.74]Why did they model a full bad dragon for this scene?
[300:00.30]It's like if it wants to be a single player game and a multiplayer game at the same time.
[300:05.19]I guess, yeah.
[300:11.59]Kind of operating independently.
[300:16.45]Yeah Watch yourself now.
[300:18.37]I'm on the dragon now.
[300:19.19]I think yeah, I can invite you guys Wait, I can't Are you guys on the boss about to see it right now Whatever made that sound is not happy and my cut scene's almost over Stay on your toes Uh, I'm gonna join polka
[300:47.84]Oh, this one hurts.
[300:51.95]Yeah, I died trying to join you.
[300:56.17]Wait, really?
[300:56.63]Oh, yeah.
[300:59.49]Because I'm, like, standstill.
[301:01.81]He's, like, lasered you, right?
[301:03.91]I don't know.
[301:04.51]My screen had a whole full menu on top of it.
[301:07.88]Oh, this menu's sick.
[301:10.02]We better keep our distance.
[301:15.88]Well, we can observe from afar.
[301:32.92]I think the issue is I just I only cracked open one bush light earlier and that was a big mistake just one oh my god he one shots yeah you'll see it guys so what is the light part of that what makes it light
[301:58.42]does that mean like low cal low low on alcohol what's light about it lower hops low on hops calories and alcohol like hops and yeah probably more watered out that's why you just drink water if you want more water in it
[302:28.29]You guys got wiped out.
[302:29.27]Then you get bloated on water.
[302:30.95]You just won't talk to me.
[302:36.62]I'm in the cutscene right now.
[302:41.62]I can't hear.
[302:43.90]Okay.
[302:46.74]Is he talking to me?
[302:47.28]Is this real?
[303:02.92]it is a full 700 meters to walk to you I would say this is the first hard guy I wanted to open his mouth and roar and it's just like

[304:33.77]I did my one, um, joke of the day.
[304:41.74]It must be really good to have that pressure gone.
[304:43.64]You don't have to do another.
[304:44.56]Yeah.
[304:47.80]I'm just trying to get to a safe place so I can join your game.
[304:53.43]just let it kill you it was honestly faster when you respawn at camp oh I need to eat food that's what this is
[305:31.96]and now he doesn't want to hurt me alright it left alright we should probably we should probably wait for uh j man even if it heals yeah this is kind of like

[306:59.30]I wonder if you can TP to my camp.
[307:00.40]I actually might be able to.
[307:05.32]See if you can.
[307:11.58]Are you able to use the camp while this is active?
[307:15.49]Yeah.
[307:20.63]Where is your camp?
[307:21.83]What does it look like?
[307:22.95]Near 16.
[307:23.37]The left of 16.
[307:28.06]Oh my god, you can.
[307:31.32]Oh, well, we just figured out some tech.

[307:40.51]I don't fuck with Eric.
[307:42.97]Wait, the camp changes everything, no?
[307:45.13]Do we have access to the item box and stuff?
[307:51.32]I mean, we could just TP so much easier.
[307:53.50]Why don't we find a boss?
[307:55.92]Make sure you eat the food steak if you have it.
[307:59.50]That's actually so good.
[308:01.74]What does this guy do?
[308:11.48]Cow.
[308:18.17]This camp is insecure.
[308:19.57]Probably can get destroyed by one of these monsters.
[308:24.53]No, it's just not confident.
[308:38.39]There is.
[308:38.77]Where's the weak point?
[308:40.62]Wings?

[310:56.01]What is this on the floor?
[310:56.83]Did a piece of him break off?
[311:20.31]His left wing is normal now.
[311:23.31]Oh yeah, you can pick it up on the floor.
[311:25.34]Heavy slicing pod.

[318:08.60]Beautiful poached salmon.
[318:19.53]Apparently saying don't use armor spheres on low rank.
[318:21.81]It's not a good use of your stuff.
[318:38.84]Alright, I am going to head back.
[318:41.60]So where do we start?

[319:28.98]TP to your campsite.
[319:32.24]It's still there?
[319:33.82]Yeah, mine's still up, but I don't think we're in the same party, actually.

[319:42.18]Wait, talk to the press courier.
[319:44.48]Counter.
[319:45.49]Oh, here we go.

[320:24.92]I think I prepared already.
[320:30.54]Alright, sitting up for this one.
[320:32.96]Let's go.
[320:38.47]Puff your chest out like make yourself tall.
[320:44.15]They're scared of that.
[320:46.85]I can't do that.
[320:55.50]I wonder the stamina drink last where I wonder.
[321:00.36]Wait, is my camp still up?

[321:37.76]You could grill something on your helmet.
[321:42.39]Whoa.
[321:46.55]Sorry, there's so much dust in my eyes, I can't really see very well.
[321:52.21]I got to give you a Ster.
[321:59.29]Yeah, you look cool.
[322:00.89]Thank you.
[322:07.55]You just don't care about these bones.
[322:08.71]That's insane.
[322:09.33]Insane?
[322:10.55]I thought I figured it out.
[322:11.49]Insane bone skipper?
[322:20.47]Pick him up.
[322:25.07]There's a sneak attack on it.
[322:29.37]You can sneak attack him?
[322:31.43]Yeah.
[322:33.07]We walk up to him and press F. What?
[322:37.70]It's sneak attacking me right now.
[322:39.06]My character has no idea I'm in a fight.
[322:43.78]Wait, I take way less damage now.
[322:45.18]Oh my god.
[322:49.28]Oh my god.
[322:51.55]No, I'm dead.
[322:53.53]No, dude.
[322:54.25]No, dude.
[322:54.99]No, no.
[322:55.61]Oh, I forgot to refill my potions.
[323:00.53]On its back.
[323:06.23]Completely missed.
[323:15.46]Get him down.
[323:17.76]Yeah, I can't aim that far.
[323:18.58]You're about to be down.
[323:23.82]Bonk.
[323:24.80]Bonk.
[323:25.90]Bonk.
[323:33.47]Already flying away.
[323:41.91]You wish.
[323:43.85]Oh.
[323:50.68]Oh, that was very painful.
[323:51.90]Please don't kill me.
[323:53.80]Please don't kill me.
[323:54.36]Please don't kill me.
[324:01.19]Dude, I think I'm I'm slaying Oh, come on, I think I'm being slain Big damage dude, it's heading toward the others.
[324:22.50]Okay, he's gone in pursuit The others should be at the camp beneath the oasis
[324:34.07]Ow, that like hurt my stomach.
[324:38.48]Your stomach?
[324:40.84]Yeah, my stomach hurts now because of that.
[324:43.24]My stomach just like, that was a pain.
[324:45.04]Yeah, you told me about the third ear thing you have going on in there.
[324:52.13]That just, what did it even sound like?
[324:54.03]I can't even...
[325:01.06]Well, there's another.
[325:02.70]OK.
[325:07.00]He's getting killed.
[325:09.69]Oh my.
[325:12.33]Yeah, watch out for the bear.
[325:15.07]Just lasering.
[325:32.83]I'm not going over here ow
[326:05.09]I'm really under.
[326:06.05]I like the sand holes.
[326:17.31]Love a sand hole.
[326:21.38]Right up here on the tail.
[326:23.32]Oh, come on, he moved.
[326:24.58]Worst place to move.
[326:30.62]Yeah, he's got good sand.
[326:37.01]Okay, you're making it sound sponsored.
[326:42.23]I've played a lot of games on the beach, but... Oh my god, he almost killed me in one hit.
[326:52.44]I gotta go.
[327:00.27]These are regular potions.
[327:01.33]Where the fuck are my good ones?
[327:02.79]Dude, this armor I got is best.
[327:04.76]Where are my good potions?
[327:12.36]This guy only showed up with light potions.
[327:15.46]I thought they were on the bar.
[327:16.74]What the fuck?
[327:19.07]Low hops.
[327:20.81]Low calories.
[327:25.19]Oh, shit.
[327:29.34]Hey, what's this dude?
[327:35.56]I do right click with the middle mouse, you throw your like bombs at him.
[327:39.60]But he has controller.
[327:44.97]Ooh, he didn't like that.
[327:51.75]I've got Daggero, I've got Daggero!
[327:57.11]Someone do something!
[328:03.02]I'm on his back.
[328:15.15]Use the sword your father gave you now.
[328:19.91]Good drop.
[328:23.53]Oh, that was like 200 fucking damage there. 200.
[328:30.21]That was like 300 damage.
[328:32.97]I better get an accolade.
[328:35.15]I broke his wing.
[328:38.49]Nice.
[328:40.93]Is he doing math bad or is he doing that much damage?
[328:46.38]He's adding it all up.
[328:48.36]He's adding it all up.
[328:52.58]So yeah, we'd all have that much damage if we were adding.
[329:02.62]20 times 5 is equals 300 in your brain.
[329:05.06]That was 22 times like 8.
[329:06.80]Bones.
[329:07.08]So 160.
[329:15.24]Will you just let me have this for a minute?
[329:18.99]Can you put a camp anywhere?
[329:34.88]I don't think so.
[329:35.46]I think there's specific campsites.
[329:40.87]Are we ready?
[329:41.43]I think we're good.
[329:44.44]Charge!
[330:15.04]You got a tail slam.
[330:18.40]Oh, let's go.
[330:19.70]Oh, yeah.
[330:27.47]Oh, yeah.
[330:27.95]Thanks, Capcom, for this.
[330:30.31]Okay.
[330:37.09]Oops.
[330:39.97]Gotta get that horn off.
[330:55.28]oh I forgot to whetstone I'm probably getting to about that point I mean like is it a gradient or do you just need to do when your weapon gets to the bad part I think the more it goes down the worse it is I took it out and it I don't know attracted lightning I guess that makes sense unluckers
[331:31.44]We're pretty close.
[331:54.09]Ooh, that was good.
[331:58.31]Oh.
[332:16.34]Dodged not even close Come on do it
[332:54.94]I need to get in front of him.
[332:58.58]I'm out of potions too.
[332:59.74]This is bad.
[333:10.52]Controller aiming.
[333:11.39]I'm in the hitbox.
[333:14.69]What's offset attack?
[333:26.09]Hey!
[333:26.77]Holy shit, one hit?
[333:29.15]Make sure you get it.
[333:41.78]Well gamed.
[333:43.40]Too bad Vinny's gonna have to do that alone.
[333:45.26]Hit parts of the floor.
[333:54.63]Now.
[333:55.81]Now!
[333:56.21]I don't see any.
[333:56.95]Yeah, I think because we got it already before.
[333:59.79]I saw one on the ground earlier.
[334:04.71]We got it.
[334:14.95]Yeah, Vinny can get that done quickly.
[334:27.72]That was fun.
[334:28.28]It was cute.
[334:33.26]It's cute, I guess.
[334:35.40]It's cute.
[334:42.65]That's pretty cute.
[334:45.93]Damn, Gemma, 14 items.
[334:51.12]Finally got an accolade.
[334:56.23]That just means I drank a shitload of- I just was chugging potions.
[335:03.93]14 items used.
[335:07.77]That is such a bad... accolade.
[335:12.41]I ate a bunch of food and I drank too many potions and well at least I didn't die.
[335:18.19]Alchemist is a cool class.
[335:19.49]That was one heck of a monster.
[335:22.21]It's weird that they also gave you a bow.
[335:24.57]should we go find the others they should still be at the pop-up can my my character is so stupid right now how is he he's calmed down says he'd rather be alone main mission chapter two poor kid we did it
[335:55.59]I believe there are four chapters is actually what it was showing hey so now we can farm these enemies it's back there whatever we want and then and keep going appreciated to the next chapter why is it glowing
[336:24.68]no clue but I noticed it when setting up where the heck is the blacksmith this is what verner was going on about yeah it looks just like what we saw in azuz except this one's glowing this is what true power looks like where do you think it goes we can go back outside yeah
[336:55.13]It stopped glowing.
[336:56.58]Where's the marker?
[336:58.22]What else?
[337:04.36]What does it mean?
[337:09.65]I'm just gonna toss this up.
[337:11.01]I think this and the sandstorm might... No, it's a real possibility.
[337:14.95]We should tell Werner what we found.
[337:16.55]Good idea.
[337:17.66]It's always so jarring when... I wonder what your... I want to hear what your character sounds like in these cutscenes.
[337:27.83]I could tell you what they sound like.
[337:29.77]What's the line your character said?
[337:31.09]Yes, good call.
[337:32.17]Yes, good call.
[337:33.06]Ugh.
[337:33.36]That's what my character sounds like too.
[337:40.96]Ugh.
[337:45.03]it's very jarring because I have a very strong jawline and it zooms in the character's face and he's like yeah I'll do it between the wounded radar and its attacker if either had reached the village I have no I'm so lost it's a lot to chew but simply all you have to do is talk to murder back where the hell's warner and azuz
[338:15.69]H-Hazus?
[338:18.61]Chapter 2.
[338:20.19]What's Base Camp?
[338:21.73]Rated R. That'd be crazy if the game just like changed its rating, Act 1 to Act 2, and you have to stop playing.
[338:31.71]You're scared.
[338:33.69]Yeah, going from Act 1 to Act 2, a please put in your birthday pops up to prove that you're old enough to play the next chapter.
[338:43.02]Things are about to get real.
[338:45.36]Put in your birthday, boy.
[338:46.84]It's like changing out a disc.
[339:00.77]It's like the second disc is the mature audience disc.
[339:10.22]Alright, boys.
[339:12.89]I'm going to save it here.
[339:13.59]You guys keep playing.
[339:17.35]Have fun with it.
[339:18.55]It's a good game.
[339:19.91]It's just a slow burn.
[339:21.86]I feel I don't know why it's been six years since I played Monster Hunter: World, but I feel like this one was an even slower burn.
[339:30.82]I feel like the pacing and everything would have been absolutely fine if we weren't trying to do multiplayer with it.
[339:35.76]But the fact that they took a multiplayer-centered game and did that too, it seems rough.
[339:40.65]Again, I haven't played the older ones, but from what you guys were saying.
[339:43.01]The multiplayer was always kind of weird, but this one felt like an extra menu.
[339:49.03]There was an extra menu on this one.
[339:51.59]Every time you do something, you have to pop one more open, then you go to the next menu.
[339:55.34]It was a plus one menu kind of game.
[340:02.19]I agree well hopefully the next one I know Vinny will still be playing and I'm pretty much uh if you guys are playing I'll be playing I think from this point forward now that we're we kind of gotten through a lot of it we kind of get it now first hour or two was just like wait what's that menu how do I do that who's wait who joined who how do I open a menu wait we need to be three in three different parties
[340:31.92]yeah and now we know about the camps the camp tech but yeah it was good playing with you guys uh I'll be probably around like early this next week if you guys want to do anything else I know the um Etalyx mentioned wanting to play too a couple I know a few other people wanted and I want to play wow still too so
[341:01.45]I hope you level up in WoW.
[341:04.33]Yeah, thanks for playing, guys.
[341:05.07]I hope you get to the highest level.
[341:08.36]I probably won't, but I will try.
[341:09.70]Alright, take it easy, guys.
[341:14.10]Good to see you.
[341:15.68]Yep, see you.
[341:19.52]Alright.
[341:22.98]That was Monster Hunter Wild.
[341:26.90]You probably could judge by the amount of complainer Andes.
[341:32.06]We were having a little bit of trouble in the beginning with crashes and trying to join each other and... But I think this is the point right now where... Okay, now there is... So, for instance, look.
[341:50.04]Now...
[341:54.71]We could pick any of the... This is where you can start to target gear.
[342:04.64]And I think we can do higher ranks eventually too, right?
[342:15.41]Are there higher rank versions of the same monster?
[342:17.16]I think there is.
[342:21.83]Yeah, I would say the co-op is... That was very painful to try to get that to work.
[342:33.16]Okay, just joining is one thing.
[342:36.02]I just wish you could stay in each other's game.
[342:49.38]But it is what it is.
[342:50.42]The game is... The actual game is fun.
[342:53.06]I think the video game is fun.
[342:54.56]I mean, all the... It's Monster Hunter.
[342:57.96]Monster Hunter is just fun.
[342:59.79]Killing stuff and carving and making new gear.
[343:03.25]That's the whole point.
[343:03.97]That's this entire gameplay is that.
[343:05.45]I think we're at the point now where it opened up enough where it's... Alright.
[343:10.55]Now, hey, let's go kill the Chattacabra 10 times and go make that or whatever.
[343:20.57]But it's always good to hang out with the boys.
[343:23.27]Sure, we'll see them again soon.
[343:25.29]And then I... Next time you see me live... What's today?
[343:27.47]Today is... 28th.
[343:33.89]I don't know.
[343:34.65]I don't know.
[343:39.23]Maybe this weekend at some point.
[343:43.32]Maybe this weekend I'll hop on and do a few things because actually I want to play.
[343:47.40]I got a couple of old goofy games I want to play just messing around in.
[343:53.60]Got at least two or three of them.
[343:58.10]So maybe we'll do is maybe this weekend, be the tomorrow or Sunday.
[344:02.68]I'll hop on wow and kind of do like the Nancy Drew type situation.
[344:16.74]I don't think these games are more than an hour or two long.
[344:18.86]The ones I'm describing.
[344:20.02]What about funny Ichiyo horror games?
[344:28.10]We'll do that next.
[344:28.62]Yeah, next weekend we'll do that.
[344:31.60]On Saturday or Sunday or something.
[344:35.40]8th or something will stamp it there.
[344:42.41]Yeah, Monster Hunter Wilds, I would say if you like Monster Hunter, it's just more of that.
[344:47.48]You just get more of the game that you love.
[344:50.64]It feels like a little bit slower of a burn than the other one.
[344:53.25]At least the other one that I really played to the end.
[345:00.39]But the game is very fun.
[345:10.39]What about Infinity Nikki?
[345:13.05]Ah, that's right.
[345:13.63]I'm going to keep that promise.
[345:17.67]You'll see it.
[345:18.61]I promise.
[345:24.48]You will see it.
[345:39.67]We'll see.
[345:52.30]You know what I'm looking forward to?
[345:53.50]I want to see some of the crazy monsters like the one we just saw.
[346:01.97]It was very easy to get grumpy at this game, I will say.
[346:08.92]That was some very... There was at one point where I was just going to go like, what the fuck this?
[346:19.72]But you have to power through that and then you get to the really awesome video game.
[346:29.70]There was almost a fuck Capcom moment, yeah.
[346:32.54]It was close, but not close enough.
[346:35.46]Honestly, without the boys, without those horsemen, I may have said that.
[346:40.44]I may have been like, God, what the fuck is this?
[346:44.77]But that poke said something funny, or Vinny said something, or Ster was like, oh, did the voice changer, and I was like, oh, that's right.
[346:57.53]And if you like the story too, I mean, we... We kind of were just trying to get through it.
[347:03.73]To play together.
[347:09.30]I'm imagining we'll probably play it again.
[347:10.92]You'll probably see it again.
[347:12.04]Especially now that we got through into the next chapter or so.
[347:17.76]Take care.
[347:18.18]Call your mother.
[347:18.68]Have a good one.
[347:19.36]See you probably maybe on Sunday?
[347:22.16]Saturday?
[347:22.70]I might just turn it on tomorrow.
[347:23.90]You never know.
[347:31.51]I've been streaming a lot.
[347:32.33]I have.
[347:34.31]I've had time, though.
[347:34.99]I've had time.
[347:36.15]Holly's been on vacation.
[347:39.58]She's visiting family.
[347:42.20]And then, you know, I've got some time.
[347:45.18]And then WoW kind of took over.
[347:46.64]So I'm around.
[347:49.66]I'm around.
[347:49.94]Alright.
[347:55.89]Take it easy, guys.
[347:56.37]See you later.
[348:06.48]you
[348:41.36]you
