[00:19.88]I got my feet up underneath my desk.
[00:22.91]Very cool.
[00:23.96]Hi lounging.
[00:27.82]Do you have one of those things under your desk?
[00:31.03]It's like a little cushion.
[00:32.22]Do you do like a cushion under the desk?
[00:33.36]Yeah, I have a little ottoman.
[00:34.36]Oh.
[00:36.75]Yeah, I got one of those too.
[00:37.93]It's nice.
[00:38.92]Can you angle it or is it just flat?
[00:41.91]It's flat.
[00:42.43]Oh, do you have angle tech?
[00:45.26]You're gonna have to share the angle tech.
[00:48.43]Okay, if you have an angled one, one you can actually angle?
[00:51.89]you can put your feet flat on it too.
[00:55.72]So it's kind of, instead of having your heels rest on it, it's just like a boom.
[01:01.30]It's pretty good.
[01:03.41]Send me the link.
[01:06.96]I'll link you.
[01:07.98]I've probably done irreparable damage to my back from putting my feet up all the time.
[01:12.50]Every once in a while I have to like move it away so I don't keep doing it.
[01:16.75]Yeah, I... Dude, I gotta start getting up more, moving around.
[01:20.93]I got a treadmill, but...
[01:23.43]It was good when I was visiting you and I could just like roll you up into a rug like a little caterpillar and you would crawl around.
[01:30.31]that's my workout routine that takes a lot of core strength to do that
[01:39.54]Get ready for more Idle Dice Game?
[01:41.70]No!
[01:42.04]That is not the plan today.
[01:45.85]The plan today is 11 AM.
[01:48.99]Did you see that game, by the way?
[01:49.95]You should try it.
[01:50.88]I did.
[01:52.34]You think you can get a higher score than me?
[01:55.07]If I put the game on 10x speed.
[01:58.43]Yeah, but you have to do it legit though.
[02:01.20]You can't do it not legit.
[02:06.26]I'm fine I'll be good okay uh today we've got some uh we've got a bunch of things to do today
[02:15.45]First thing we're gonna do is we're gonna play this zombie game and it's a zombie apocalypse.
[02:20.74]Look out behind you, but a good thing you got a friend with you to watch your back.
[02:27.42]Have you played this yet?
[02:28.65]Have you looked at this yet?
[02:30.38]I looked at it.
[02:31.11]It looked cool.
[02:32.31]There's something about you that makes me want to play a zombie game with you.
[02:36.33]You're like a good zombie partner.
[02:39.01]Are you saying that we would survive the zombie apocalypse because I would be with you?
[02:44.76]I think so, but I think it's just like...
[02:47.30]We've had a lot of good zombie times.
[02:49.01]Like the time I shot myself in the face.
[02:50.60]Wasn't that a zombie game in VR?
[02:52.39]It was dying light.
[02:56.11]I think zombie games come with an inherent freedom.
[03:01.94]There's not very many zombie games where it's like, oh, hey, by the way, don't do this.
[03:05.88]It's like, no, dude, what you can do is you can throw the... No, do it.
[03:09.29]Go get that computer and throw it at the zombie.
[03:11.31]Because, like, zombies are just...
[03:12.19]I think they are the perfect blend of, like...
[03:16.39]There's a lot of downtime where you're doing nothing and there's no zombies where you can talk about cereal and then you know when to lock in because zombies show up.
[03:22.97]Yeah.
[03:23.33]And then it's back to like, OK, let's talk about cereal again.
[03:26.04]It actually is like the perfect kind of video game, isn't it?
[03:30.35]Alright, so let's see.
[03:31.32]Are you in the game?
[03:33.30]We're also going to play... You're not in the game.
[03:36.98]Oh, no.
[03:37.35]I'm playing the dice game.
[03:39.95]Aw, dude, that's a pretty good one.
[03:43.52]After all that zombie talk, I think I'm just gonna skip this.
[03:46.07]So you can play that.
[03:47.09]Okay.
[03:48.47]But in a couple of hours, we're going to play Where Winds Meet.
[03:53.39]And I will tell you, and it's for a sponsor, I'll tell you, I did not expect the character creator
[03:58.71]to be that fucking insane.
[04:01.68]Oh, did you do it?
[04:02.76]I did do it.
[04:03.38]I was hoping you'd do it on stream, because it is fucking wild.
[04:06.43]It's crazy, the shit that you can make.
[04:08.62]Jerma joke of the amount of the amount of sliders.
[04:13.28]There's like a
[04:15.15]There's a slider for a slider.
[04:17.94]And you can make pretty much anything you want.
[04:20.03]It's kind of crazy.
[04:20.59]Hold up.
[04:21.23]Hold up.
[04:21.65]I have a picture.
[04:22.98]Did you see the thing?
[04:23.82]You can...
[04:25.61]it makes a character your face based on talking into your mic yeah I I didn't even do it I just was I saw the sliders and I'm like I'm going all in on those
[04:37.59]That is not... Yeah, you can upload a photo of yourself.
[04:42.43]It kind of reminds me of like the NBA 2K thing where it's like, oh, dude, put yourself in career mode.
[04:48.48]Yeah, it did not...
[04:50.82]It didn't do a great job...
[04:52.19]Hold on.
[04:53.03]It didn't do a great job of...
[04:54.98]I gave it a difficult picture.
[05:01.32]But I don't know if it's a crazy character creator.
[05:05.59]Yeah, dude, just sitting there manually and adjusting everything was it was crazy.
[05:10.10]I was laughing my ass off.
[05:12.47]But we'll get to that in a couple hours.
[05:17.64]The first thing I'm going to do is Whisper Mountain.
[05:20.65]And then tomorrow you're going to play the White Knuckle update, right?
[05:23.72]I'll watch you do it.
[05:31.73]What are they putting in it?
[05:33.05]Is it substantial?
[05:34.88]Can I invite you?
[05:35.59]It sounds substantial.
[05:36.75]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:37.74]Hold on, hold on.
[05:39.30]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:40.67]I mean you were late before I was late.
[05:42.27]That's true.
[05:44.64]And then you were later than you said you would be late.
[05:46.58]Well, that's also true.
[05:47.93]Do you want to do normal?
[05:48.76]Do you want to do veterans not in the game yet?
[05:54.09]How could you be a veteran of something that's new?
[05:57.08]Also, a rhythm game came out that I want to play.
[06:00.68]It looks pretty fun.
[06:02.27]It's called Bits or something.
[06:03.90]Bits and...
[06:05.51]It's got a funny...
[06:06.80]I think that's the one.
[06:10.17]If you if you what are you thinking?
[06:12.77]Baubles or trinkets?
[06:14.50]Trinkets.
[06:14.82]OK. Let me see if I can invite you.
[06:24.41]Okay, I'm on the main menu.
[06:28.04]Okay, there's a room code.
[06:29.77]I cannot leak the room code, but you don't leak the room code.
[06:33.20]I'll give it to you.
[06:34.54]Okay, I'll not leak the room code.
[06:37.91]I've never leaked the room code ever.
[06:40.10]Fun fact.
[06:42.47]You actually, I don't think you have.
[06:44.22]I actually don't think you have ever done that.
[06:48.98]Okay, I'm not going to leak the room code yet, but this is important stuff to see.
[06:54.99]Should I be a rookie, sprinter, or security guard?
[07:00.17]I don't know.
[07:02.88]Who do you think I am just by hearing those three words?
[07:06.49]A rookie.
[07:07.72]Really?
[07:09.64]not sprinter okay armor the standard pistol and can craft more early on but loses it on death poorly trained in melee combat okay but that sounds like that kind of sounds like that sucks
[07:21.85]Okay, well, now I have to rank up.
[07:25.08]That's true.
[07:25.57]I'll take it.
[07:28.26]You get a safe house.
[07:31.76]Bureau has placed some protective measures to, okay.
[07:34.09]However, it looks like the procedures won't hold.
[07:35.56]Yeah, this looked like pretty fun in the trailer.
[07:41.51]Is this new?
[07:43.52]I think it's fairly new or it's still getting updates.
[07:45.75]Is it early access?
[07:46.37]I think it's early access.
[07:48.95]Go check the map on the table.
[07:50.22]Alright.
[07:50.63]I can give you a...
[07:51.31]Okay.
[07:52.50]I don't want to leak this, so...
[07:56.02]Does a dash interact?
[07:58.39]Throw?
[07:58.82]L1 consume?
[08:00.26]I hope I can get back to this, right?
[08:02.25]okay attack is r2 aim gun l2 shoot gun r2 I'm just I'm just waiting
[08:10.25]Okay, hold on.
[08:11.55]I just don't want to leak the code, dude.
[08:15.55]I think it was hurt myself.
[08:17.46]Oh, shit.
[08:17.80]I have to hold the button.
[08:18.76]Oh, it looks like I'm getting ready to hurt myself.
[08:21.93]I'll type it in here.
[08:22.49]Hold on.
[08:29.05]Okay, I got the code here.
[08:31.20]That is the room code.
[08:33.34]Don't leak it.
[08:44.49]Let me know when you're in.
[08:48.67]Oh dude, you can play as Leon!
[08:54.26]Dude, this seems like it's right up your alley.
[08:57.68]Get that mouse off the screen.
[09:00.07]Alright, come over here.
[09:03.49]Mission.
[09:04.05]Are you talking to me?
[09:08.82]You leaked the room code?
[09:09.81]No, I didn't.
[09:14.00]Yeah.
[09:16.15]There's 700 people in our lobby.
[09:18.82]It's so funny that all you have to do is a chatter to just freak
[09:21.73]I could be in a single player game and somebody could be like, dude, you leaked the room code.
[09:25.94]And I will stop for a second and be like, are they serious?
[09:28.23]What'd I do?
[09:29.92]That is a trigger word for like every streamer I think that exists.
[09:34.37]Not me because I've never done it.
[09:38.46]Alright, grab.
[09:39.30]So, okay.
[09:40.56]I think it's kind of you...
[09:41.95]It seems like it's a game where you kind of have to choose.
[09:44.06]Kind of like Slay the Spire-esque, where you choose which path you're going to go.
[09:48.72]Alright, local clinic.
[09:50.08]Grab the target item and bring it back to the transporter.
[09:54.47]Grab target item, bring it back to the transporter, retrieve the classified container.
[09:58.35]You ready?
[09:59.70]Yeah.
[10:01.38]Alright, go to the car and get ready.
[10:06.94]I don't think we have.
[10:08.57]We don't really have anything.
[10:10.92]Yeah, we're we're new.
[10:13.11]Rookie.
[10:15.80]Oh, you're just a rookie?
[10:16.69]Yeah, I'm a sprinter.
[10:17.97]You have a gun.
[10:19.28]Holy shit, is this the streamer that showed his dick when he beat Millenia?
[10:22.22]That's somebody else, dude.
[10:23.14]It's not me.
[10:29.81]Okay, parking lot.
[10:30.75]So, how do we open the map?
[10:34.26]It's on M. Dude, it's a classic M for map.
[10:37.17]I know it's M for map, but I'm on controller.
[10:39.86]Oh, well, then you messed up.
[10:41.59]There's a map on the top, right?
[10:43.24]Yeah, that's right.
[10:43.80]Alright, so let's go in here.
[10:44.95]Oh, gun.
[10:45.99]That was quick.
[10:47.80]Oh, how do you switch the gun?
[10:49.73]I don't know.
[10:52.07]Oh, there we go.
[10:52.45]Alright.
[10:52.89]So let's go in here.
[10:57.60]I love when we play one person mouse, one person keyboard, and neither person knows.
[11:01.19]Like, we both have to learn the button.
[11:02.64]I don't know.
[11:03.86]Help.
[11:04.37]Help.
[11:04.67]Help.
[11:07.74]Gunshot is in my room dude.
[11:10.18]It's loud.
[11:11.47]Hold on.
[11:16.40]Is that as loud for you as it is for me?
[11:17.88]Uh, I lowered it.
[11:21.48]I go into the options on my stream.
[11:23.90]I do too.
[11:25.21]I don't know if you're like against doing that or something.
[11:28.08]I always do that.
[11:29.52]Oh, check in here.
[11:30.10]Might be loot.
[11:33.02]Wow, guys, you finally got Jerma to play Ark Raiders.
[11:37.50]Do we share loot or does this take everything?
[11:39.43]Oh, there's a Molly.
[11:43.79]So I started with the pistol.
[11:44.79]Maybe I shouldn't use it.
[11:47.90]Okay, my inventory is full.
[11:50.22]My inventory is- what do you mean my inventory is full?
[11:53.31]I picked up one item!
[11:57.32]What?
[11:57.57]Oh, we only have like- we have four inventory spots.
[12:00.00]Oh wait, you can combine herbs.
[12:03.87]I got emerald gemstone!
[12:09.82]Is that zombie talking?
[12:11.07]Oh, you got Zed behind you.
[12:13.19]I do.
[12:16.45]Oh fuck, I have no stamina.
[12:19.26]I got you Okay Yeah, I'm something of a sprinter
[12:32.03]Why does it look like Ryan Reynolds in the lower left?
[12:35.86]Ooh, Molotov.
[12:37.83]Is there friendly fire?
[12:39.96]No, good.
[12:40.36]I'm not sure.
[12:45.45]Oh shit, I gotta pick a lock?
[12:51.82]I don't think my controller works for this part.
[12:57.29]Does it work?
[12:57.77]Does your controller work?
[13:00.40]I'm learning the mechanic, but yeah.
[13:02.33]Wait, is that you doing that?
[13:04.31]Yeah.
[13:05.10]Oh, wait, I think I... You can, like, watch me.
[13:08.45]Oh, I get it.
[13:09.65]You don't have to move.
[13:15.49]These are intelligent zombies.
[13:18.15]You can hold it to swing harder too.
[13:24.84]Zombies have better weapons than we do.
[13:27.85]This is the tutorial level.
[13:29.38]We're going to be fine.
[13:31.77]I'm just saying, like, why can't we pick up... Can we not hit these guys?
[13:35.04]What is that?
[13:36.68]I don't know.
[13:37.69]We need to get a fuse.
[13:39.00]Amber gemstone.
[13:40.16]Dude, this is a look.
[13:41.76]It's a unique gemstone.
[13:45.29]I don't have any space.
[13:48.74]Do you want shotgun bolts?
[13:51.11]I'm taking the Amber.
[13:53.58]Okay.
[13:55.29]What do you think happens if I hit this as hard as I can?
[13:57.99]Dude, it gives you so much time.
[14:03.88]Tony Soprano.
[14:04.99]Actually, it's a rare.
[14:05.99]Oh, dude, you just activated the zombies.
[14:11.06]Okay, wait, I actually want this.
[14:13.23]Uh...
[14:16.05]Who needs heals?
[14:16.69]I don't need it.
[14:22.02]I just dropped that.
[14:24.49]We need to get a fuse.
[14:26.26]Yeah, let's do it, man.
[14:29.67]Hold his heads in here.
[14:31.98]That sounds like the fucking Brazilian politician guy.
[14:34.68]I watched that video.
[14:35.95]It does sound like him.
[14:37.19]That's crazy.
[14:38.86]That's too wild.
[14:45.45]I think that is real.
[14:46.91]It's not real unfortunately.
[14:52.09]Chemicals.
[14:55.03]Alright, the music changed.
[14:55.99]Does that mean it's got- does it get people spawning on us?
[15:00.67]I need an emerald gemstone and a pearl gemstone.
[15:03.59]There's a pearl one here.
[15:06.17]Hey, Pearl, one over here, bud.
[15:08.52]Okay.
[15:09.21]Can you pick it up?
[15:13.95]Okay, we need an emerald gemstone.
[15:17.30]I have emerald.
[15:18.04]Oh, put it in.
[15:19.90]Wait, what is this menu I'm looking at?
[15:22.13]It's unlocked.
[15:23.36]Oh, God.
[15:23.98]Here, you touch this.
[15:26.63]What the fuck?
[15:27.78]What happened?
[15:30.15]Alright, do we have to solve a puzzle while somebody else fights the monsters?
[15:33.62]Alright, you have to do the puzzle, it's not me.
[15:36.62]Figure that out, touch it.
[15:37.50]It's like, I think it's, I don't know.
[15:43.19]I just missed everybody.
[15:49.07]Alright, puzzle.
[15:50.83]Uh, we gotta do...
[15:53.00]Pick gem.
[15:54.67]Let's do...
[15:55.33]I think there's a pattern.
[15:58.01]There's a pattern on it.
[16:00.02]Check the pattern.
[16:03.68]Dude, I'm gonna die!
[16:04.95]Do you have any heals?
[16:07.48]Uh...
[16:08.48]I don't know.
[16:10.90]I have mixed herb.
[16:12.39]Thank you.
[16:14.12]Okay.
[16:15.57]It's red?
[16:17.84]Red, yellow, purple, red, purple.
[16:22.34]Okay, come on, Blueprints player.
[16:24.43]That's not fair.
[16:26.02]Okay, so what...
[16:26.87]I don't know what I'm even doing here.
[16:29.64]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[16:31.09]So...
[16:33.07]It goes green, light blue, blue, red.
[16:39.22]So green.
[16:40.12]So we need a but we we can't move.
[16:44.24]Wait, do we have to get we have to pick up not have the right ones.
[16:47.23]No, we gotta do...
[16:48.40]They're over on the right, here.
[16:50.00]There's a pattern we have to get.
[16:51.75]There's no... We don't have another red to complete the pattern.
[16:55.20]Oh.
[16:58.12]You know what I'm saying?
[16:59.36]No, we can definitely complete it.
[17:00.79]It's got to be blue, because it's blue, red, yellow, purple, red, purple.
[17:09.27]We only have access to green.
[17:13.76]The game expected us to beat this because the horde is not here anymore.
[17:17.29]Wait, can we pick up anything?
[17:18.22]No, only these three.
[17:21.40]Okay.
[17:23.68]I got it.
[17:24.52]I really don't know what I did.
[17:25.51]Wait, I didn't even get to look at it!
[17:30.57]What did you do?
[17:31.27]I just put the gems in and whenever it lit up a color, I knew it was right.
[17:34.59]Oh!
[17:37.52]Am I out of stamina?
[17:41.82]Wait, I have all the shotgun shells.
[17:45.49]I have the shotgun.
[17:48.37]How do we resolve this?
[17:50.94]Okay, how about this?
[17:52.02]You can take... Oh, he gets all the pistol ammo too.
[17:54.35]Here, fine.
[17:56.84]Do you have pistol ammo for me?
[18:01.85]I don't know if you can unload that pistol.
[18:06.55]Maybe.
[18:06.81]Yes, I could.
[18:11.73]It's crazy that the zombies are so smart they knew to put a puzzle in front of the fuse we needed.
[18:16.34]Can we open this door over here?
[18:18.73]No.
[18:20.53]We can't jump?
[18:22.56]No.
[18:23.82]Look at the map, bro.
[18:26.39]Come on, bro.
[18:27.36]Why not?
[18:31.72]Nice try.
[18:37.27]Wait, did you get the fuse?
[18:39.39]Yep.
[18:39.71]Okay.
[18:40.40]I got this one.
[18:41.19]Don't worry.
[18:41.75]Just keep me covered.
[18:44.75]Okay, I need to use my mouse for this because it doesn't like the controller.
[18:51.94]I wish I could watch you doing it.
[18:53.80]I don't think it works that way.
[19:02.22]Let's go.
[19:09.17]When you full charge hit them, they fall on the ground and they're not always dead.
[19:12.49]You can keep hitting them.
[19:14.42]Oh, there it is.
[19:14.89]Classified container.
[19:21.32]Endless horde incoming.
[19:23.29]Uh, I guess we gotta get out the front again?
[19:25.22]How do we- wait, do we actually have to leap out the front?
[19:28.12]Yeah, I think we got to go back to the car.
[19:31.63]Oh fuck.
[19:35.68]Something of a sprinter myself.
[19:42.70]Yeah, yeah.
[19:43.71]We've been in here for five minutes.
[19:45.14]Do you forget?
[19:45.70]I only have a mini map.
[19:50.50]Yeah, but you walked this way.
[19:51.88]We're retreading.
[19:53.09]Oh, fuck!
[19:53.69]I gotta open this door.
[19:54.85]That door's locked, dude.
[19:58.99]Cover me, cover me, cover me.
[19:59.80]I got it.
[20:02.78]I'm gonna die I can't, yeah, cover you is a tall order, I'm dead
[20:12.84]Okay.
[20:13.68]Alright.
[20:13.94]We understand how the fucking game works now.
[20:15.98]I get it.
[20:16.32]I get it.
[20:16.60]I get it.
[20:16.86]I get it.
[20:17.14]I get it.
[20:17.42]I get it.
[20:17.97]I hear you in game now.
[20:23.84]You guys died in the tutorial.
[20:25.36]We didn't know where the game was until right now.
[20:29.57]There's a weird in-game talk in this.
[20:31.76]It's scripted.
[20:32.74]We were supposed to lose.
[20:38.07]Alright, I get it now.
[20:42.33]Now we start at the Town Hall.
[20:43.53]Different.
[20:43.85]Alright.
[20:45.91]Alright, so let's get a route here.
[20:47.00]I think we go right door because we can go right up right.
[20:53.42]This game, I actually kind of like this game.
[20:54.52]This game's cool.
[20:56.49]Yeah, it seems pretty good.
[20:57.50]Don't do that.
[20:59.30]Well, yours is on right now, so I'm doing it too.
[21:01.23]Why is mine on?
[21:02.72]Because you pressed V in a panic while you were fighting zombies, I think.
[21:07.28]Is it off?
[21:08.57]Yeah.
[21:10.80]Okay.
[21:10.92]It makes it sound like you're talking through a tube.
[21:17.05]For all the people telling me it's up on my D-pad to show the minimap, I see what you're doing.
[21:22.60]That's to leak the room code.
[21:24.00]That's not going to happen.
[21:26.31]Actually, that's kind of a shitty place for that to be.
[21:31.72]Okay, we know what we're doing.
[21:32.70]Let's hustle.
[21:34.85]Okay, we know what we're doing.
[21:37.02]Boom.
[21:37.18]Oh, this would have been a good tutorial.
[21:40.54]Right in the parking lot.
[21:45.60]Okay, that is the map.
[21:46.73]Let's go.
[21:52.91]Alright, game's no joke.
[21:55.23]Collect everything we need.
[21:56.04]I got pistol ammo, good.
[21:59.81]Stamina recovery is important.
[22:01.21]If you go to zero, it's bad.
[22:04.06]I didn't even notice there was stamina.
[22:06.57]Yeah, if you hit zero, it's not good.
[22:08.08]That was a lifesaver right there, dude.
[22:11.01]Okay, there's other stuff in here.
[22:19.13]Nice.
[22:21.63]Yeah.
[22:22.11]Great job.
[22:24.24]Alright.
[22:24.56]Emerald gemstone.
[22:25.97]Green herb.
[22:26.47]You turned on your voice again.
[22:27.62]I don't.
[22:28.38]How?
[22:28.82]I didn't do anything.
[22:30.99]I don't know, what do you keep pressing?
[22:33.20]Check your options.
[22:34.79]Okay, it's right stick being pushed in somehow.
[22:39.94]That's a good button for that.
[22:46.37]Come on.
[22:47.80]Yeah, it sounds like it's using a webcam mic or something.
[22:50.05]It's really funny.
[22:54.33]I'm lolling.
[22:55.40]Alright, parole gemstone.
[23:00.14]Rene, take that.
[23:02.01]You're going to need that.
[23:16.17]He's literally rolling on the floor laughing.
[23:20.91]Gunpowder?
[23:21.41]I'm supposed to have a gun, aren't I?
[23:26.78]Oh, you don't have one?
[23:28.19]No, I said whenever I was a rookie, it was like, oh, you start with a gun.
[23:30.78]Okay.
[23:33.91]I have one.
[23:40.86]it doesn't even oh and we need Amber I haven't seen any of them um no Amber
[23:55.25]We didn't go into storage.
[24:00.86]Oh, there it is.
[24:06.64]stamina.
[24:11.81]These are some durable ones.
[24:15.47]I don't even have a pistol.
[24:17.65]You take it all.
[24:18.50]You be gun guy.
[24:27.85]This door is locked from the other side, aren't it?
[24:31.37]We gotta go do the puzzle.
[24:34.18]Alright, I want to look at this.
[24:36.33]I want to see how this is supposed to work.
[24:40.09]Okay.
[24:41.66]Cause it's a pattern.
[24:42.46]Are you as bad at pattern recognition as I am?
[24:46.34]Okay.
[24:48.04]Do we have green?
[24:50.73]Did you just do it again?
[24:51.61]Did you just guess?
[24:53.64]I got it.
[25:00.00]What does that sound?
[25:03.10]There's a fly in your room, dude.
[25:06.02]There's a fly in your room hovering around your head and it's so loud, it's picking up on the mic.
[25:11.27]Dude, that reminds me of mosquitoes.
[25:12.52]I hate that mosquito sound.
[25:16.03]Mosquitoes have a high pitched sound like that.
[25:18.69]I don't care about a fly, but a mosquito is that is distinct and I hate it.
[25:26.11]Because, okay, any like scientists in here, why do mosquitoes try to fly into your fucking ear?
[25:32.37]Why?
[25:32.64]Doesn't that give them away?
[25:39.28]Hey, hello, astrophysicist here.
[25:41.37]I have no fucking idea.
[25:43.08]Because it stinks?
[25:44.90]My, nobody, okay, you think it stinks.
[25:47.07]Alright, we got it, we got it, we gotta go.
[25:48.43]My inventory's full.
[25:52.99]Alright, go out.
[25:54.67]You didn't grab it.
[25:56.50]I thought you grabbed it.
[25:58.04]I was shocked.
[25:58.97]Let's go go go go go.
[26:00.61]We know the the end thing happens when we open the.
[26:04.28]Oh, I hear music.
[26:07.93]I think this might be just the normal horde.
[26:10.90]Hey, what's up here?
[26:12.48]Are you getting greedy?
[26:15.16]We have to complete the tutorial.
[26:16.49]This isn't the leave part yet.
[26:22.23]This guy is super powered.
[26:30.26]Okay.
[26:31.07]Oh, come on, dude.
[26:32.24]Alright, what is it?
[26:32.68]What is it?
[26:32.92]What is it?
[26:33.25]What do I do?
[26:34.58]I'll protect you, I think?
[26:36.93]I didn't... You did this puzzle, I don't...
[26:40.80]I got it.
[26:41.00]You got it.
[26:44.88]Ow.
[26:52.89]I'm out of ammo already.
[26:54.85]Dude, why stay- I'm gonna have to die!
[27:01.11]Alright, alright, alright.
[27:03.50]This is the loading dock.
[27:04.54]But before you pick this up...
[27:06.11]Here, I have an herb for you.
[27:07.33]Herb on ground.
[27:08.30]Are you good?
[27:09.98]I'm good.
[27:13.87]Gunpowder.
[27:14.37]Alright, when we pick this up, this shit's activating.
[27:16.90]We need to route out of here.
[27:23.37]Man, at this rate we're never going to find a cure.
[27:27.55]Loot this whole place.
[27:28.27]Tons of ammo up here for your gun.
[27:34.44]Okay.
[27:35.42]Either we pick this up and we go out the door down, out the door out.
[27:39.49]I'm saying out the door down out the door out out the door down I mean I'm a sprinter yeah
[27:46.84]I'm not a sprinter, so you pick it up and then we'll go.
[27:50.42]Yeah, you get a head start.
[27:51.95]Okay.
[27:52.15]Start going.
[27:52.80]Go down to the door.
[27:57.12]Wait.
[27:59.05]Oh, I have to pick this up.
[28:00.98]Are you going to be good, though?
[28:01.91]What if you get caught?
[28:03.90]Alright, come on.
[28:12.71]Okay, you have the thing, so we have to press it.
[28:17.27]Oh, fuck.
[28:25.57]Alright, get out!
[28:27.42]Get out!
[28:28.82]I have to hold the button?
[28:29.83]Oh my god.
[28:30.97]No, I think we just have to stand in a circle for a timer.
[28:37.55]Every once in a while I press E to use them, my whole camera turns.
[28:43.12]Because it's E for East.
[28:45.15]Okay, what we get?
[28:45.89]New location.
[28:50.20]And we got more materials.
[28:54.88]A couple trinkets, couple baubles.
[28:58.78]One skill point.
[29:01.82]Okay.
[29:03.58]So wait, can we craft stuff now?
[29:09.28]Item box.
[29:10.49]Workbench.
[29:12.69]Oh, okay.
[29:13.23]This is where you learn skills.
[29:14.97]Military book?
[29:17.79]Melee combat.
[29:18.55]I think I'm going to be melee.
[29:23.72]I think that's what I want.
[29:30.21]Melee combat.
[29:32.14]Learn skill.
[29:41.26]That one.
[29:45.03]And then we can craft stuff too.
[29:48.06]I can't craft like a...
[29:48.86]I get to craft a gun.
[29:49.89]Ooh, hip pouch level one.
[29:57.15]Oh, that's huge, dude.
[29:58.98]That's a big deal, right?
[30:00.04]Should I craft a pistol?
[30:02.11]Or no?
[30:03.80]Nah.
[30:04.66]I'm probably going to use all the ammo.
[30:07.61]Oh, you can change your character here.
[30:12.57]I'm cool with that.
[30:19.49]Oh, he's got a hard hat on.
[30:23.46]Okay.
[30:25.89]Let's keep going.
[30:28.08]Alright, do you want to go to local clinic, which has...
[30:30.31]It's got a treasure chest on it, or residential area, which has...
[30:36.18]There's a possible machine gun.
[30:41.47]The deal with this is that we have to finish.
[30:43.74]Okay.
[30:44.25]So we have to finish this one in nine minutes.
[30:48.13]Okay, we got that.
[30:49.09]Do you want to do the nine minute one?
[30:50.34]There's also a toxic spill as a modifier.
[30:54.15]I don't know what that means, but this place is kind of big.
[30:57.83]Finish your objective within nine minutes.
[30:59.36]Retrieve the classified container before time is up.
[31:01.29]So we just got to get over there and get it out.
[31:04.04]Alright.
[31:04.30]Got it.
[31:06.59]Can't bring it with you.
[31:12.40]Uh...
[31:15.78]I can give you... Do you want pistol ammo?
[31:18.03]Yeah, I got empty ammo.
[31:20.95]Ooh, I think we picked opposite classes for what we should be doing.
[31:26.35]I think I start with pistol ammo now.
[31:29.20]Oh, whatever.
[31:36.48]You know, you just you got to deal with the cards life deals you.
[31:40.99]It's true.
[31:45.54]The scariest part of this is that we have to get into a car.
[31:49.92]Yeah.
[31:52.11]Alright, it's time to go.
[31:54.50]There's like a pistol right here if you want one on the ground.
[31:57.24]Oh, hell yeah.
[31:57.86]Right here.
[32:00.36]Alright, we only got nine minutes.
[32:07.00]Where's your sense of urgency?
[32:08.07]I have none.
[32:15.86]How many hits does it take?
[32:23.12]I can't stop thinking about the Brazilian president thing.
[32:26.32]It's the funniest video I think I've ever seen in my life.
[32:27.91]Whenever they talk, it's like...
[32:32.82]It's my new favorite video.
[32:36.87]Why did he do that?
[32:39.27]It's just funny because he tries to clear his throat and it makes it worse.
[32:48.75]What is that on the map?
[32:49.48]Oh, it's blockage.
[32:50.98]Oh, shit.
[32:51.90]Oh.
[32:52.83]Machine gun.
[32:53.61]SMG.
[32:55.15]That's what was potential loot here.
[32:56.60]If you're gonna be gun user.
[32:58.74]Cool.
[33:00.09]I have SMG ammo.
[33:01.24]I'm ready to go.
[33:01.90]You want my pistol ammo then?
[33:05.03]I'll drop.
[33:06.20]Ah, sure.
[33:11.01]Can I combine it?
[33:11.98]Yeah, I don't know.
[33:14.06]I don't think I can.
[33:15.16]I think in your inventory, if you're right.
[33:16.85]Oh, I have no idea.
[33:18.60]Also, you're.
[33:19.89]Hold on.
[33:21.21]Oh, it's L2.
[33:21.76]Yeah, that's fine.
[33:22.99]Oh, this guy really is not, uh, not, not being very urgent.
[33:27.69]Yes, I am.
[33:29.92]See how I, three shots, urgent.
[33:32.81]Oh, you're wasting ammo now.
[33:34.06]He's panicking.
[33:34.68]Alright, that's a puzzle.
[33:35.52]Uh-oh, puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.
[33:36.99]A-O-D...
[33:38.02]Okay, wait, you relay it to me when I get over there?
[33:40.63]Is it going to be like a tic-tac-toe or something?
[33:43.01]A TikTok?
[33:46.66]Yeah, we have to do a TikTok dance in front of that.
[33:49.22]Alright.
[33:50.31]I got to set three...
[33:53.01]5EB7OD is what is listed here.
[33:56.55]What does that mean?
[33:57.28]Do you have to just organize it?
[33:58.75]I can read it top left to right.
[34:00.17]I don't know.
[34:01.27]I don't know.
[34:02.11]I can light up the 333.
[34:06.95]It's like a punch thing.
[34:08.00]I can light up.
[34:09.35]let me look at it and then I can tell you the numbers
[34:14.26]Okay, the projector has eight, oh, okay, okay, okay.
[34:17.90]Oh, you, okay.
[34:19.84]You go on it.
[34:21.01]I need to tell you like where each thing is.
[34:22.50]So you ask five and I'll tell you which one it is.
[34:24.55]You know, it's five.
[34:25.53]So it's middle left.
[34:27.00]Middle left.
[34:28.23]Got it?
[34:29.82]You have to tell me the next number.
[34:31.87]Bottom middle.
[34:32.67]Bottom middle.
[34:34.36]B.
[34:35.76]Middle.
[34:37.16]Seven.
[34:39.13]Bottom left.
[34:40.78]Zero.
[34:42.81]Top middle.
[34:43.95]D.
[34:45.60]Top right.
[34:48.29]Alright, that would have been horrible if we were getting attacked.
[34:53.61]I mean, that's what it's all...
[34:54.33]I like the little puzzles in this game.
[34:55.74]That is really cool.
[34:56.86]Especially if this is kind of the early stages, they probably get really... You can play this with up to four people, by the way.
[35:08.48]A game in 2025 that isn't squads of three.
[35:13.49]It was advertised as an escape room survival horror action game.
[35:20.77]So that is cool.
[35:29.27]Alright, uh, we have five minutes.
[35:30.86]Where we- where's the route?
[35:33.33]Are you- are you ballsy or are you- we're gonna just get this out of here?
[35:36.22]What the fuck?
[35:37.82]Oh my god!
[35:39.88]We'll get away from the barrel.
[35:44.69]It's still alive!
[35:45.52]It's still alive!
[35:48.87]Oh, that was a fucking bash deal if I've ever seen one.
[36:01.48]Dude, that was crazy.
[36:06.84]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:09.19]We're gonna fucking die.
[36:10.25]Alright, um...
[36:12.57]It's... We gotta get out and around.
[36:15.05]So we just have to get out.
[36:17.68]I think this is the second mission we've ever done.
[36:19.71]I think we just don't fuck around.
[36:20.77]We just get out of here.
[36:21.37]We have four minutes left.
[36:22.50]Yeah, let's get out.
[36:24.54]Start walking.
[36:25.22]I run faster.
[36:35.50]Is this the best way?
[36:40.46]Oh my god, dude, that was like a hundred of them.
[36:48.09]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[36:55.07]I hit that.
[36:55.67]I hit him with the grenade.
[36:58.71]It went boom We're out
[37:10.01]That was so loud, I don't know why.
[37:14.00]Hey, do you or your little friend want anything from the story?
[37:16.67]My little friend?
[37:17.62]What are you talking about?
[37:18.94]I fit in his front pocket and I'm just hanging out with a controller in my hand.
[37:22.73]You and your little friend.
[37:23.92]Alright, we unlocked the market.
[37:34.24]You got so much... Dude, I got two beef stews.
[37:36.49]You got so much more shit than I did.
[37:37.76]Why?
[37:38.00]How many kills did it say we had?
[37:39.73]Did I have... Did you have one kill?
[37:41.25]I had 14.
[37:45.20]You got so much more stuff than I did.
[37:46.76]You're doing a much better job looting.
[37:49.89]Sorry.
[37:50.21]Sorry, I know I'm making you look bad.
[37:55.07]Uh, level two hip poach.
[37:56.98]I wonder what, if you die, I wonder if it goes away.
[38:02.05]Probably.
[38:05.67]Extraction shooter roguelike puzzle like.
[38:11.52]This is cool.
[38:12.04]I like it a lot so far.
[38:14.97]Same.
[38:19.00]What's in the item box?
[38:19.88]I need a new melee weapon.
[38:23.85]It's a like-like?
[38:28.06]Dude, I don't know if she just likes you.
[38:30.25]I think she might like-like you.
[38:37.56]I can't be taking that heat.
[38:39.99]I'm dating someone in another school.
[38:42.66]Dude, that was a perfect...
[38:43.78]I don't even know if you understand what just happened.
[38:50.00]I want to combine my shit here.
[38:56.16]Can you do a three combined?
[38:57.79]Okay, you can do a triple green dumpling.
[39:05.99]Those words meant nothing to me.
[39:07.91]Alright, possible loot.
[39:08.86]There's crazy shit here.
[39:09.88]There's an axe.
[39:10.53]There's a...
[39:11.50]like an assault rifle is a grenade launcher.
[39:13.85]This is defense.
[39:15.94]There's going to be some.
[39:17.65]I don't think we should do it.
[39:20.03]You think we just quit the game?
[39:21.00]I only got like 20 bullets.
[39:23.00]Yeah, let's just quit the game.
[39:24.08]I mean, do we have other options?
[39:25.25]I haven't looked at this map.
[39:26.41]Oh, we know we have to do it.
[39:27.33]We have to do this.
[39:28.02]We have to just defend against the horde.
[39:30.51]Okay, let's do it.
[39:32.34]I don't know why we'd put ourselves in a position where we're surrounded
[39:35.85]as an objective in a survival situation but you know I'll suspend my disbelief for this just this once it's to get supplies because if we don't get supplies then we're dead
[39:47.91]Yeah, but if we've got supplies in a place where there weren't zombies.
[39:53.66]I need some supplies.
[39:57.85]Yeah, did you level up your skills?
[39:59.81]Yep.
[40:03.55]Okay.
[40:05.00]Engine started in... We have to survive for ten minutes?
[40:10.59]We gotta go loot, man.
[40:11.43]Oh, fuck.
[40:12.10]Okay.
[40:14.15]I have to turn off the electricity first.
[40:16.02]Where's the electricity?
[40:18.45]I'm not ready.
[40:19.86]Um, go to the car?
[40:25.59]Oh, thank you.
[40:37.27]10 minutes of this?
[40:39.12]Dude, I don't know.
[40:40.55]We might get a break.
[40:44.46]Eternal break.
[40:46.17]We're doing alright.
[40:46.79]When you fucking die.
[40:50.20]We're doing okay.
[40:53.23]Let's go.
[40:55.04]It's going this way.
[40:56.91]I imagine it's probably the car.
[40:58.99]Shotgun.
[41:00.61]Probably... can die.
[41:03.83]I think the whole point is we have like a minute to get to salute.
[41:06.68]Oh my God, damn it.
[41:10.26]Defend me.
[41:11.43]I'm doing it.
[41:12.69]Okay, I'll defend you.
[41:13.32]I'll defend you.
[41:13.88]I said defend me!
[41:16.41]We didn't see the... Alright, I'll defend you.
[41:18.12]You...
[41:19.34]I'm defending you.
[41:23.95]You're not doing a very good job!
[41:26.26]I hit him so many times, you have no idea.
[41:28.85]It resets the whole thing if I get hit.
[41:31.81]Get these shotgun shells, you idiot.
[41:36.14]Leave me alone.
[41:37.00]What did I do?
[41:40.60]Shit, I have my triple dumpling.
[41:42.49]I don't want to use it right now.
[41:43.44]Oh!
[41:50.41]Uh, we have to...
[41:52.76]I gotta use triple dumpling.
[41:56.81]Okay, this is the end.
[41:58.74]For us, I guess.
[42:07.67]I'm dead.
[42:10.97]I think you can revive me.
[42:12.51]Oh god.
[42:17.20]Dude, this is hard.
[42:18.52]I like this.
[42:19.91]This is cool.
[42:20.90]Careful.
[42:23.72]That was great, but like, man, I was, I, once you are hard enough, you can't run anymore.
[42:28.22]No, yeah, you're screwed.
[42:33.02]Okay, we made a mistake.
[42:35.49]I think we should have stayed at the car.
[42:37.02]I think we should have stayed at the car.
[42:41.94]This game is fucking hard, dude.
[42:43.80]I see that person in chat.
[42:44.91]I see what you're doing.
[42:50.33]Alright.
[42:51.31]We have a new map.
[42:52.82]Do we keep anything?
[42:55.13]I think anything you put in the box, we keep.
[42:57.14]I think we keep everything.
[42:58.10]So if you've leveled up, you keep it.
[43:00.62]Yeah, we got the crafting.
[43:04.26]What is a radio HT?
[43:06.31]A handheld transceiver that enables long distance communication.
[43:10.11]Oh, that's like if you're doing VoIP, which we're not.
[43:13.90]We're technically cheating.
[43:15.13]Oh, we kept our hip pouch size as well.
[43:20.92]We are technically cheating.
[43:23.48]But it don't matter.
[43:26.27]Alright.
[43:27.73]Town hall.
[43:28.50]Same deal.
[43:34.10]I'm itemless.
[43:34.61]Just having space to carry is pretty big.
[43:37.10]It's a big deal.
[43:50.08]Hey, I just watched your Spyro 2 stream from way back.
[43:52.85]It's nice to see that you're still around.
[43:54.07]I don't, have I ever done that?
[44:07.25]Dude, good red barrel.
[44:14.64]Red barrel's peak game design.
[44:24.04]It stalls locked from the other side.
[44:25.60]Whoa.
[44:32.62]Nice.
[44:36.37]Does it keep one of our progresses?
[44:39.78]No.
[44:40.50]Once you exit it, it's over.
[44:46.08]Which is why you need a friend to defend you.
[44:48.83]Dude.
[44:49.64]Red guy.
[44:59.95]When these guys laugh, they sound like General Grievous.
[45:03.75]I guess we gotta save a lot of our stuff for the defense if we're gonna have another one.
[45:07.50]It's true.
[45:16.16]It's got a Willem Dafoe ad.
[45:19.40]Like an ad for Willem Dafoe or an ad for a movie he was in.
[45:23.80]What are you talking about?
[45:26.17]Do I even have a pistol?
[45:27.68]I don't.
[45:31.08]I would love a different melee weapon.
[45:38.24]Voila.
[45:40.02]This guy's so crazy.
[45:41.67]Okay, if they have red eyes, that means they're just impossible to kill.
[45:47.86]I googled dermospiro2 and the AI summary hallucinated a non-existent stream of yours.
[45:55.45]I love AI summaries.
[45:57.03]They're always accurate and helpful.
[45:59.04]Every time I read one, I'm like, wow, that really is precisely what the information I wanted.
[46:09.71]I think I posted the video of us watching Game Awards and the AI summary is like, Star hosts his regular Expedition Awards.
[46:19.70]Cool.
[46:19.98]Thanks for that.
[46:20.75]The expedition awards.
[46:25.69]Yeah, Expedition 33.
[46:28.82]Oh!
[46:30.06]Maybe it was making a joke.
[46:34.11]No, it doesn't know how to joke.
[46:36.84]It's a fucking robot dude.
[46:40.50]I was doing it.
[46:46.60]I have to put dodge on circle.
[46:49.91]I didn't know there was a dot.
[46:51.10]I forgot.
[46:52.08]I forgot.
[46:52.60]I don't... R1 is...
[46:54.01]I gotta put it on circle.
[46:55.30]I just used...
[46:56.10]I drank a potion.
[46:57.27]Good.
[46:57.79]That was big info right there.
[47:00.42]Yeah, R1 is dash.
[47:05.70]People are hanging from the ceiling, dude.
[47:07.56]That's, oh.
[47:11.93]I don't know, man.
[47:13.18]I'm not sure I can play this.
[47:14.83]It's a little too much, I think, for me.
[47:21.55]When I suggested a game like... We could play Super Mario Galaxy and I could be the little star thing and you could control Mario.
[47:27.66]That's kind of what I was... That guy was like...
[47:31.54]Blood and I guess like naked or something.
[47:34.08]I don't know about this.
[47:34.82]We should play Super Mario and like I'll be the camera and you'll be the movement buttons and
[47:43.03]Okay, do you think...
[47:43.99]I'll do the jumps.
[47:45.00]Do you think if we actually did that, we figured that out, that we could get 120 stars?
[47:51.89]I've never played that game ever, I don't know.
[47:56.07]I mean, if we...
[47:57.27]I think if we devoted enough time...
[48:07.01]I'll tell you some of the hardest I've laughed in the last like six months was watching T1 play Mario 64 with a keyboard.
[48:16.54]It was genuinely some of the hardest I've ever left.
[48:19.31]It was so fucking good.
[48:20.69]It was so unbelievably good.
[48:23.54]It was like one of the best streams I've ever seen.
[48:31.51]I'm not sure I quite like sometimes it looks like I thought I was connected on that.
[48:35.22]I don't know.
[48:36.95]You're kind of the fuse master.
[48:38.32]It's it's weird.
[48:40.25]It's tricky.
[48:40.81]okay alright I'm gonna grab this thing and then we're out you start running like we don't even need to kill these guys what does it loot
[48:52.30]Oh shit, there is a shotgun up here.
[48:54.43]Are you good?
[48:55.85]Yeah, I'm good.
[48:56.38]Now that I know there's a dash button and I'm the sprinter.
[49:03.25]That seems... good info.
[49:06.03]Uh, I cannot- You have to start it because you have the item.
[49:25.73]Dude, this will be the Whisper outbreak run.
[49:37.27]Yeah, you have to whisper while you play this if you use VoIP, otherwise the zombies hear you.
[49:41.73]I would not be surprised if that was in the game.
[49:44.39]I would.
[49:46.33]Dude, again, I only got two stews.
[49:47.99]I need to get better at fucking...
[49:49.40]I might just do keyboard and mouse for this.
[49:52.63]I feel like controller is harder to use.
[49:55.26]Oh, we halfway through the playthrough.
[49:57.12]You're going to change your whole play style.
[50:00.52]Hmm.
[50:03.61]Is that better?
[50:04.44]I don't think you got it like that.
[50:10.87]Control is good.
[50:15.19]Uh, it was pointed out to me that, uh, I do think this, like, we have a life system and we're gonna lose all their shit if we die again.
[50:21.74]Because of the lanterns and the ritual and the respawn.
[50:25.15]Life stimulant?
[50:26.14]Have you been doing this?
[50:29.37]No, I'm natty.
[50:30.48]Because this is I think a permanent health increase.
[50:34.95]It is.
[50:38.80]That seems kind of like a huge deal.
[50:41.07]I don't think I can craft it.
[50:44.58]Did I use all the material?
[50:45.74]We don't share materials, do we?
[50:49.63]No, I mean, like, you might have a perk I don't have.
[50:52.29]I don't see it.
[50:53.20]On craft item, you don't have life stimulant level one?
[50:59.32]Oh, I do.
[51:00.14]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:01.01]That seems pretty important.
[51:03.56]You can dismantle stuff, too.
[51:04.59]Maybe I'll dismantle this grenade.
[51:06.10]Ooh!
[51:06.28]Ooh!
[51:08.46]That gives you a bunch of stuff.
[51:18.05]You're pretty brave, dismantling a grenade.
[51:20.32]I wouldn't.
[51:22.76]Okay, well.
[51:23.94]Alright, we can do local clinic, which is the same thing we just did, because pick up briefcase and run.
[51:27.92]Or we can go hard mode.
[51:29.50]What if we did local co-op?
[51:31.01]We could.
[51:33.08]This is timed and the modifier is faster zombies.
[51:37.40]But there is possible for a sledgehammer.
[51:40.44]Let's get you a melee weapon for the first time.
[51:43.02]Okay.
[51:43.48]Well, faster zombies is the case on this one.
[51:45.56]It is a...
[51:48.24]Okay, threat level single skull.
[51:54.18]Wait, give me a gun.
[51:56.05]Wait, there's a toy gun.
[51:56.84]Doesn't carry over, does it?
[51:59.30]No.
[52:00.56]I can give you the handgun I have.
[52:02.61]Do you hate chat today?
[52:03.59]I don't hate chat today.
[52:05.80]I don't know.
[52:07.03]We'll see.
[52:08.41]Depends on how well you behave.
[52:10.04]We've got like three or four games we're playing today.
[52:12.69]Depends on if you behave.
[52:13.97]We won't hate you.
[52:15.79]Alright, nine minutes.
[52:24.32]We're looking for a sledgehammer.
[52:28.03]Jeremy, come here.
[52:28.87]What?
[52:30.98]I thought you found a sludge hammer.
[52:31.94]I was a bit so happy with you.
[52:42.69]That guy's got a sledgehammer.
[52:46.22]Does he drop it?
[52:46.86]No.
[52:50.74]Oh, we got to turn that and electricity.
[52:54.42]You just killed Charlie Brown.
[52:55.70]I keep pressing tab to open the map.
[53:00.11]Dude, that's so sad.
[53:01.05]That's so fucked up.
[53:01.80]Like, even Charlie Brown... Cover me.
[53:05.10]Okay.
[53:06.91]For what?
[53:10.22]menuing.
[53:13.04]Alright.
[53:22.62]Fuck.
[53:24.63]Fuck.
[53:27.14]Do you need me?
[53:27.75]No.
[53:31.63]We need a bolt cutter for this door up here.
[53:33.38]I got a bolt cutter right now.
[53:36.68]Pass it to me.
[53:38.12]Pass it.
[53:39.51]Pass.
[53:39.63]No, no, no.
[53:40.35]We need to find... We have seven minutes to find me a melee weapon.
[53:43.92]Pass.
[53:44.14]Pass.
[53:45.17]Pass it to me.
[53:47.90]I'm trying to make use of my sprinting capabilities.
[53:50.09]I upgraded sprint.
[53:51.35]I have a dash.
[53:53.58]You do like to go fast.
[53:56.52]We're on a time limit.
[53:58.36]That's very true.
[54:01.49]Ah, come on.
[54:02.03]Sludge hammer.
[54:04.58]Please.
[54:10.54]scraps, cocktail, bunch of bullshit.
[54:15.73]Survivor, we have intel that there's a sledgehammer in this one house.
[54:20.72]Hey, I would...
[54:22.31]I would want it if I was like, dude, I put all my points into melee.
[54:28.55]Is putting all your points into melee the same thing as like going to the gym and being able to bench like three or four hundred pounds?
[54:35.67]I think that's you putting points into melee.
[54:37.86]Well, shotgun.
[54:39.37]You can take shotgun, I have one.
[54:44.63]I mean, I guess.
[54:49.42]I remember the new Deus Ex 2 when that came out.
[54:53.78]I put all my points into strength.
[54:55.93]There's like two walls in the whole game you could break with it.
[55:02.28]Still think about that every once in a while.
[55:07.78]Oh, he's wasting ammo in the exploration phase.
[55:11.18]Sludgehammer is what... Yeah!
[55:17.05]Yeah, dude, I got it
[55:30.28]Wait a minute.
[55:31.90]Waggy man.
[55:32.73]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:35.40]Escape route.
[55:36.46]Down, down, up.
[55:38.91]Down through the east alley.
[55:41.75]Oh, okay.
[55:43.17]His ID is 6606waggyman.
[55:48.39]Oh, that's the wrong one.
[55:49.37]That's 66066.
[55:50.98]Oh, shit.
[55:55.90]Well, where's that guy?
[55:58.78]We're gonna have to come all the way back up, I think.
[56:06.39]I dare you to hit something with your sledgehammer.
[56:08.12]I just got a- Wait, wait, wait, okay.
[56:09.81]This is- No, no, go back up.
[56:10.72]This is Basuki.
[56:12.51]5, 4, 7, 3.
[56:19.69]5473.
[56:29.61]Yeah, I would personally not wear my passcode around my neck.
[56:36.30]Yeah, that's not a great idea.
[56:39.30]Okay, we got the- that's the power charge thing.
[56:41.75]Hold on, I gotta combine some shit.
[56:43.28]I want that tonic
[56:47.23]Guy can't remember four numbers.
[56:49.68]He's the memento protagonist.
[56:54.43]What's my name?
[56:55.98]What's my password?
[56:56.78]Oh, thank God.
[56:57.57]That movie's crazy though.
[57:02.75]I'm out of stamina.
[57:04.37]Yeah.
[57:06.25]A little too real for me.
[57:07.34]I did Memento until I was 15.
[57:12.07]Did that part of the movie when he just kind of, it just flashes and he goes, okay, where are you?
[57:16.48]Where are you running?
[57:17.64]Where are you?
[57:19.65]It hits me.
[57:20.35]It's like, whoa.
[57:22.61]Okay.
[57:22.97]Guy coming around the corner.
[57:24.02]Why am I running from him?
[57:30.09]Is this game on mobile?
[57:31.69]I don't know.
[57:32.63]I don't think so.
[57:37.55]Turn off the electric.
[57:38.62]Wait, where do we turn off the electricity?
[57:41.80]Did you see a power panel?
[57:43.35]Yeah, we can go there.
[57:46.84]Oh, there's too many zombies.
[57:47.95]We need someone with a sledgehammer.
[57:49.86]I can do that.
[57:50.42]Come here.
[57:52.30]Oh wait, is this blocked?
[57:53.84]No, we're down here.
[57:57.68]We only have three minutes, man.
[57:59.62]Watch out.
[58:00.28]Monster.
[58:01.39]There's a fucking spitter and a fucking zombie who's spitting and shit!
[58:06.36]I think we don't need to kill this.
[58:08.37]It doesn't move.
[58:09.25]I'm just running around.
[58:10.06]I'm getting the thing.
[58:11.02]Oh, there's a door to unlock.
[58:12.39]Oh, there's a machine gun.
[58:15.82]This thing's kind of slow.
[58:16.99]I've got to be prepared for that.
[58:26.15]Ah, that fucking guy is here again.
[58:28.42]Yeah, I threw a molly on him.
[58:31.12]Okay, fuck that.
[58:32.40]We got two minutes to get out of here.
[58:46.20]Alright, we gotta go.
[58:51.42]I've gotten a silly amount of ammo on this level.
[58:56.46]Compared to the other run.
[58:59.19]Wait, I got a lot of materials too.
[59:01.34]Oh fuck, okay.
[59:19.93]Gotta go.
[59:24.09]Yikes.
[59:26.10]I don't think that was an endless one.
[59:30.93]Okay, we need to turn this off, get this, and get the fuck out of here.
[59:34.85]Where's the panel?
[59:36.52]Wait, did we do the panel?
[59:37.46]We did it, alright.
[59:38.43]Yeah, pick it up.
[59:39.89]Oh, fuck.
[59:40.30]Hold on.
[59:41.18]I gotta...
[59:43.84]Alright, now we just gotta get out.
[59:53.21]Ow, that hurt.
[60:05.61]I got a lot of materials, so this is a good one.
[60:17.90]Yatta!
[60:28.36]Okay, we've got tons of scrap.
[60:33.04]Dude, look at all my materials.
[60:34.76]I was such a greedy little shit.
[60:40.88]I could have said, I could have said, Hey dude, pick this up on the ground.
[60:45.26]I was like, no, give me.
[60:50.03]Dude was hungry.
[60:52.70]Hip pouch level four.
[60:54.08]I think I'm going to break this down.
[61:01.23]I think I'm going to break down.
[61:05.63]Period.
[61:08.40]Oh hell yeah.
[61:10.06]Oh, hell yeah!
[61:11.65]Alright, I can craft a spiked bat now.
[61:30.76]I need a shitload to craft that.
[61:32.79]Shit, I don't like that.
[61:39.47]Okay.
[61:41.13]Police station.
[61:41.73]This is just finished within nine minutes.
[61:45.24]You only need three more scrap.
[61:46.65]Hold on.
[61:47.13]Really?
[61:48.70]How much do I have?
[61:51.15]Oh, shit.
[61:51.66]I'm gonna do it.
[61:58.84]Okay, now I got a spiked bat.
[62:02.11]Is spiked bat better than a sledgehammer?
[62:07.49]Does it show damage?
[62:11.21]Spiked bat versus, wait, I can put it in the box.
[62:15.31]Yeah.
[62:17.00]Oh, that's a good idea.
[62:18.91]Cool.
[62:19.25]Okay.
[62:21.96]Alright, police station is just live.
[62:24.62]We have to get the classified container and it's a nine minute timer.
[62:31.55]I think we're alright.
[62:33.27]We could use more heals though.
[62:36.43]I have like three herbs in my inventory if you needed it.
[62:43.81]I'm herb stacking, but I didn't bring them.
[62:55.41]Alright, just keep keep it rolling.
[63:02.98]Sledgehammer is so good.
[63:07.95]Officer's Notebook.
[63:09.95]Got the package from P.T.
[63:11.98]Nevada Mining.
[63:13.15]A token of gratitude stashed in the armory.
[63:17.46]Room passcode had already been sent to the captain's email.
[63:21.26]Alright, we gotta go to the cap- we gotta open up the captain's emails.
[63:32.63]Oh, you take an herb.
[63:35.09]Thank you.
[63:40.45]Also, I think combining herbs doesn't make the heal stronger.
[63:42.98]It just stacks it, I think.
[63:46.85]Oh, really?
[63:47.66]I think so.
[63:48.80]That could be completely wrong.
[63:49.70]I don't think it is.
[63:52.95]I got a lot of herbs.
[63:53.94]I should do that.
[63:54.93]Another shotgun on the ground.
[64:02.96]I'm taking everything.
[64:06.65]Okay, you need to take some shit because I'm taking everything.
[64:10.69]I have a I have so much ammo.
[64:13.44]You think you're taking everything, but I'm boom wealthy.
[64:19.51]I think I took the shotgun shot.
[64:22.06]Combine this shit.
[64:25.76]Alright, I got two double dumplings.
[64:27.49]That was a dumb idea.
[64:30.58]Um, dude, we're running out of time.
[64:32.73]We got seven minutes.
[64:37.48]I can hear you in game.
[64:46.60]SMG.
[64:47.10]Do you have an SMG?
[64:50.01]It's in my stash.
[64:51.12]How are you on herbs?
[64:52.14]I got double stack.
[64:55.22]I'm good, I have two.
[64:56.71]How do you stack them?
[64:57.97]You just combine them in the inventory.
[65:00.45]Okay, yeah, I'm good.
[65:05.45]Okay, this has a code.
[65:09.64]Computer in the office up here.
[65:13.87]I'm in the jail area and it looks like it's gonna be real bad in here and I need you.

[65:59.97]Wait, no, we can't.
[66:12.24]Not the ad port.
[66:14.85]It did feel good to do this.
[66:16.00]We're playing this game because we felt like it.
[66:18.17]We're doing the sponsors off for like another 30 minutes.
[66:21.50]Wow, wait, he likes games.
[66:25.75]Just the way I said that apparently was like.
[66:27.66]It was cool.
[66:34.85]Uh, we need to go to the computer.

[67:26.93]I don't know the password.
[67:28.03]Do we get a password?

[69:25.61]Wait, it was...
[69:31.06]A warning regarding computer password codes.
[69:32.63]Do not use birth dates because it will be easily predictable and might be exploited by irresponsible persons.
[69:38.38]The year is replacing the birthday.
[69:44.29]The member ID.
[69:45.25]So it's 04...
[69:46.72]18, and then it's their member ID.
[69:54.40]Who's the member?
[69:57.15]We have two minutes.
[69:58.24]We gotta go.
[69:58.66]I'm freaking out.
[70:01.74]Oh, this was for the armory.
[70:02.76]We have to leave.
[70:03.16]I think that's, like, optional.
[70:05.05]It's ma- I- He- Dude, he confused me when he was doing it first, and then I had to look at it, and then I confused myself looking at it.
[70:10.46]And we only have a minute to- We gotta go.
[70:12.45]We gotta go.
[70:12.78]What do we have to turn on?
[70:15.31]Do we have to go to the armory, dude?
[70:16.68]I think we have to go there.
[70:18.55]I don't know.
[70:19.19]I think we failed.
[70:20.37]Alright.
[70:21.03]Member ID.
[70:21.55]What's his name?
[70:22.07]What's his name?
[70:22.58]Who is it?
[70:24.08]What's his name?
[70:24.76]George.
[70:25.32]George.
[70:26.26]Ferdy S is his name.
[70:27.67]His name is Ferdy S.
[70:29.73]That's not the birthday.
[70:32.26]Member ID plus 180496.
[70:36.78]His name was George?
[70:41.07]safe in here?
[70:41.74]What is this?

[70:49.10]Or his ID?
[70:49.44]I don't know who it's supposed to be.
[70:55.59]It's 180496 plus his ID.
[71:01.01]We gotta find this guy.
[71:04.42]It's over.
[71:04.74]We lose.
[71:05.96]That's way too many.
[71:07.43]We lost.
[71:07.73]We gotta find this guy's ID.
[71:10.60]This map is giant and it feels like the fourth person would help.
[71:15.57]Oh, fuck.
[71:17.44]Can we just, like, leave and fail the mission?
[71:19.43]I think we just...
[71:21.08]I think we're fucked.
[71:26.28]We needed his eye- is it not him?
[71:28.97]Was there a guy that we could interact with that we didn't see?
[71:30.76]I'm not sure.
[71:44.12]Dude, there's an... Yeah, it's over here.
[71:47.51]What is it?
[71:48.18]It's the archives room.
[71:50.12]I'm at the computer.
[71:54.23]If you can find it, I'm at the computer.
[71:56.94]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[71:59.87]I got another computer.
[72:00.51]We got a new email set of emails.
[72:03.46]Oh my god.
[72:04.32]Okay.
[72:04.48]I gotta get out of here.
[72:05.05]His name's Donnie K. He's sergeant.
[72:07.04]His member ID is 28.45...
[72:11.74]Alright, you gotta... Dude, we have to do 28, 45, 70...
[72:13.55]There's a boss in the room.
[72:14.47]There's a boss in the room.
[72:15.74]There's a boss in...
[72:16.64]I'm stuck.
[72:17.43]I'm stuck.
[72:17.81]I'm dead.
[72:19.21]This is the wrong guy.
[72:21.99]What do you mean it's the wrong guy?
[72:23.21]Fuck, is there another guy's computer?
[72:25.08]Oh fuck, wait, what's his name?
[72:27.13]Okay, 28 point...
[72:28.78]I'm down, dude.
[72:39.45]Man, the real horror is the puzzles, not the zombies.
[72:43.45]Alright, we didn't go in the archive room.
[72:45.84]We went in every single room besides that one.
[72:48.31]That's so funny.
[72:50.30]Oh well.
[72:54.76]Game over.
[73:00.07]That puzzle wasn't hard?
[73:02.00]Well, it would have not been hard if we went to the archives room and knew what the guy's ID was.
[73:08.06]We went in reverse.
[73:08.78]We went to computer first.
[73:10.60]game everyone's made me feel crazy I was doing the birthday wrong
[73:17.64]His birthday was also in the, yeah.
[73:19.43]So the- Red herring.
[73:21.99]Okay, it said birth date.
[73:24.00]And we were reading the date the letter was printed.
[73:28.79]Which was April 18th, 1996.
[73:30.82]His birthday was on the archives.
[73:32.99]If we had seen that, we would have known that was what was going on.
[73:42.50]Hey, you don't know what you don't know.
[73:45.51]Alright, do we get time for another quick 20-minute one?
[73:49.63]I mean, if we hustle...
[73:51.54]I think the server just dropped money.
[73:55.27]Yeah, it like closed the game as we lose.
[73:57.66]The game is it closes.
[74:00.55]Uh, I think we kept our... You keep your character.
[74:12.77]Uh, how do I... Yeah, I'm gonna need that room code.
[74:16.39]Would you like to start a new game and overwrite this slot?
[74:18.79]No.
[74:19.29]How do I just go from here?
[74:23.59]Continue game one.
[74:25.08]I don't want to override it.
[74:29.38]Am I crazy?
[74:32.31]Yeah.
[74:32.79]See, okay, continue game, right?
[74:34.98]It's like, okay, there I am.
[74:38.07]Would you like to start a new game and overwrite this slot?
[74:40.44]Isn't that scary?
[74:41.96]should I not do that is it gonna start some oh man what the fuck
[74:50.99]Wait, what?
[74:52.39]I just deleted my guy.
[74:58.38]Yeah, I think we have to because we're dead.
[75:00.85]We're just dead, dead?
[75:02.56]Yeah.
[75:03.08]I like, you know, you get to which upgrades you take in which order are important, you know?
[75:08.22]Let me get you the room code.
[75:09.49]That was neat.
[75:12.76]Okay, everybody, room code.
[75:14.37]Get ready to join.
[75:17.47]OK, let me get you there.
[75:19.94]Here you go.
[75:21.39]It is 180496.
[75:26.77]Okay.
[75:27.79]I gotta do my wardrobe.
[75:28.90]So he really is the start of the beginning.
[75:30.23]Okay.
[75:31.14]Cool.
[75:38.23]Alright, we got 20 minutes.
[75:40.30]More like 15.
[75:42.43]Before we move into the sponsor.
[75:51.42]And then after that, after a couple hours of that, are you...
[75:56.96]What are you up to?
[75:58.18]Because I could play a rhythm game or we could play this again.
[76:01.52]How are you feeling?
[76:03.67]I mean, we'll see at that point.
[76:05.78]I do want to play more of this game at some point.
[76:08.02]This is going to be fun.
[76:12.08]Alright, you ready to start?
[76:13.18]We got to kind of move it.
[76:16.23]Yeah.
[76:23.11]What did you pick?
[76:23.66]This game's also pretty cheap without a discount.
[76:32.43]I mean, it feels like there's a fair amount of things to do.
[76:42.60]What dude god RNG we got a we got the pearl gemstone right there, dude
[76:51.07]This is the run.
[76:52.16]Ah, praise Gaben.
[76:53.59]Praise Gaben.
[76:55.90]This is the run as long as it ends in 20 minutes.
[77:08.46]I'm out of breath.
[77:09.84]Oh my god, me too.
[77:10.38]I'm exhausted.
[77:12.84]I'm tired.
[77:17.33]The character should have a sneeze meter.
[77:21.25]And, like, if you're gonna go for a melee swing, like, right when your sneeze meter is filling up, like, oh, man, it's gonna get interrupted and...
[77:29.55]They're not going to play this game again, are they?
[77:31.74]I can assure you that Ster is going to probably play this game for the next two weeks straight on his stream and probably beat it and do really well and get a crazy high score.
[77:39.42]I think this game would not be as fun without a friend, and I would love to play with you again, but, you know, you've been very, very busy with your, um...
[77:48.03]don't know he's really close to curing all diseases I'm so close you have no idea he keeps having to like stream
[77:59.06]You have no idea, my laboratory, my home laboratory.
[78:07.54]I don't know take your pick you want another stream or do you want all diseases at once
[78:16.87]I just healed accidentally.
[78:25.02]I combined fish oil, peanut butter, and a base, and I boiled it.
[78:40.17]We were looking for the emeralds.
[78:41.78]Emerald mission is a tricky one when you have no inventory.
[78:47.46]It's true.
[78:50.97]Where can we...
[78:51.79]Hold on.
[78:52.72]We're not timed.
[78:54.97]Meeting room?
[78:56.73]Something we didn't do in the meeting room.
[78:57.84]We are timed.
[78:59.00]No, we're not.
[78:59.65]Not on this one.
[79:02.24]Well, I mean overall.
[79:03.45]What are we missing here?
[79:09.23]Oh, Pearl Gem.
[79:18.09]You mentioned One Piece last stream and I passed out.
[79:22.43]I think you should relax.
[79:24.72]I think that's an outrageous thing to do.
[79:32.92]Hi.
[79:48.50]Jambi.
[80:01.26]Did he say, I'll eat them?
[80:04.28]I'll eat them.
[80:11.82]Alright, we made it to the Great Hall.
[80:13.43]This probably... Dude, it looks like there's a... Um...
[80:21.35]I wonder if there's like a big boss at the end?
[80:23.68]That'd be kinda cool.
[80:24.17]I threw a grenade by accident!
[80:24.99]Why did you... Did that hurt you?
[80:28.00]I don't... Maybe a little, yeah.
[80:30.67]I don't think it did.
[80:32.32]I have 70 out of 100 health.
[80:33.37]I didn't see you go...
[80:34.53]I didn't see you because the zombie hit you.
[80:36.79]No, no, it didn't.
[80:43.23]Oh, electricity.
[80:54.13]That usually would get a laugh out of you.
[80:55.71]What's going on with you today?
[80:56.84]You alright?
[80:57.84]Um, I really, I may be a little desensitized to it after 12 years.
[81:04.08]Hmm something up with you.
[81:10.05]You good?
[81:11.79]Oh wait, we need the container?
[81:13.02]What were we doing?
[81:14.61]We gotta go to the load- Oh fuck, we gotta go this way.
[81:16.52]Oh, there was a- there was a- There was a door.
[81:20.43]For some reason, I thought that was the fuse to the car and that's all we needed.
[81:25.44]Replace that fuse in the car.
[81:30.79]The cars have fuses, right?
[81:32.00]I don't know.
[81:36.01]Hord!
[81:37.54]Oh, you do it.
[81:38.04]You do it.
[81:38.54]Got it.
[81:56.16]Don't forget the dash.
[82:03.18]If you accidentally hit that dude, it's gonna be such a funny moment.
[82:12.64]Okay, yeah, when you combine herbs, you use them all at once.
[82:15.89]You do?
[82:16.42]It's just a bigger heal.
[82:22.06]Okay.
[82:22.46]Get ready to run, man.
[82:23.59]I know, I know, I know.
[82:24.30]We've got to go left, down, around.
[82:26.24]Got it.
[82:26.92]Go.
[82:41.01]You can close doors, fun fact.
[82:45.08]You went the wrong way.
[82:45.83]No I didn't!
[82:53.41]Activated!
[83:03.17]Hell yeah.
[83:13.80]Mission time.
[83:14.91]We were in there for 70 minutes.
[83:24.35]Just be careful.
[83:25.28]My character is Squid Game.
[83:39.04]I'm doing health.
[83:43.42]Combining herbs creates a better mix.
[83:45.22]That seems good.
[83:46.11]Oh, these perks you pick are random.
[83:49.29]from like, oh, military book.
[83:50.87]It's like a completely different set.
[83:52.74]Yeah, I think that's maybe why the game over happens, because it's kind of like, oh, a run.
[83:57.00]That is why it over happens.
[83:59.75]I bet.
[84:04.40]I'll take it.
[84:11.73]This is an itchy, scratchy kind of game.
[84:13.34]It does scratch that itch.
[84:16.75]It's like last time we had a whole bunch of gunpowder and we never had...
[84:21.64]I'm going to say we probably should save it here.
[84:27.43]We'll move over to the Ster Sponsor Sunday on Monday.
[84:32.33]Hashtag Jerma's partner.
[84:36.00]And then after we'll figure out what we're going to do after.
[84:40.51]Okay.
[84:43.09]Uh, so you, I might have to do like one mission.
[84:45.88]I made my character, but I think I need to do one or two things before to get to the co-op so you can hang out.
[84:52.32]can do some other side things maybe I have maybe five to ten minutes uh did you finish like the tutorial and then you spawned in next to like there's a broken house you just stopped
[85:01.68]Yeah, and like a girl comes up to you and she's like, hey.
[85:05.36]And then you put it at three times speed and she goes...
[85:07.43]Uh, no.
[85:10.84]Okay, you can do that.
[85:12.39]It's kind of funny.
[85:13.33]Oh, you can do times three speed.
[85:15.66]In cinematics, if you press R, the bottom left, it has a cinematic time speed.
[85:20.83]Dude, okay, I gotta tell you, I don't know if I...
[85:25.58]I...
[85:25.85]My character's fucking crazy looking, okay?
[85:29.42]I got news for you.
[85:30.22]Mine too.
[85:30.82]Mine's wild.
[85:32.59]I think you're gonna like it.
[85:33.83]When I was on the character creator, it's like, oh, what a popular downloads for people that uploaded their creations.
[85:39.21]One of them was a legit one-to-one SpongeBob SquarePants.
[85:42.92]It just, it looked, it was just a square with the, it's fucking insane.
[85:49.17]That is one of the most in-depth character creators I've seen in a long time.
[85:53.49]I was thinking about doing it on stream, but I knew it was going to take forever.
[85:57.88]I just thought you were going to do the voice thing and take whatever it gave you.
[86:01.95]Alright.
[86:02.51]Do you want to take a quick break?
[86:04.54]Go pee or something?
[86:05.29]Come back and be ready?
[86:05.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[86:07.19]I don't know how the in-game invite system works.
[86:09.34]We'll figure that out.
[86:10.78]That's why I wanted to start a little early.
[86:12.67]But we'll be right back.
[86:14.24]Next game incoming.
[86:15.56]as sponsors starting very shortly.
[86:18.94]See you in a minute.
[86:24.30]In just a second.
[86:26.33]In just a little bit.
