[00:01.03]Good afternoon.
[00:01.53]Where's my coffee?
[00:04.36]What?
[00:05.44]It disappeared.
[00:59.34]here now hello everybody good afternoon we're going to continue Chibi-Robo now if I finish it tonight that's a question I should I don't see why I will not considering there's only about six hours seven hours left in the game we should do it tonight
[01:29.96]Thank you for joining me.
[01:32.84]Taking an extra second.
[01:33.66]Why am I out of breath?
[01:37.72]Well, I guess I just sprinted.
[01:38.84]That makes sense.
[01:39.48]Yeah, I did just sprint.
[01:42.31]I hit the mute button.
[01:43.23]Yeah, I'm an idiot.
[01:44.61]I hit the mute button, I got up, and I like... Grab.
[01:53.65]We got a long hallway.
[01:54.39]So, I'm good.
[02:00.61]Are you guys ready for Chibi-Robo Part 2?
[02:05.51]Coffee's worth it?
[02:06.13]Yes, it is.
[02:07.97]It's always worth it to get a coffee.
[02:12.25]Man should, yeah.
[02:13.49]When you describe to people that you're full sprinting for more than three to four seconds down your hall, you have a, I guess you have a big house.
[02:22.48]May have been embellishing a little.
[02:27.88]But anyways, let's go.
[02:30.98]I don't need to wait, because I don't need to introduce this, because we just did it yesterday, and I... Here we are.
[02:37.83]Caffeine is terrible for you?
[02:41.12]So are bananas, apparently.
[02:54.06]Yeah.
[02:56.82]Don't ever do anything wrong, right?
[02:59.63]Don't ever drink caffeine.
[03:01.35]Don't ever fucking go to an R-rated movie.
[03:04.77]Don't ever do anything wrong.
[03:09.37]Only drink water, and sit in your house, and lie in your bed and look at the ceiling.
[03:16.18]And every so often, get up and stretch.
[03:18.40]And only eat lettuce.
[03:20.54]Um, though lettuce is bad for you too.
[03:22.38]Because fucking the romaine scare, yeah.
[03:25.32]Literally don't do anything, ever.
[03:36.81]Way ahead of you.
[03:41.90]Live the tortoise life.
[03:43.78]Well, don't be in the water because there's all the bacteria and all the fucking gross shit in the water.
[03:47.80]In our oceans.
[03:49.06]Oh no, don't go swimming.
[03:51.50]Don't drink coffee.
[04:02.47]The only thing that you should do is fart on your webcam.
[04:05.27]That's the only thing you should be doing.
[04:09.66]Well, what the fuck can I do then?
[04:11.92]You tell me.
[04:13.40]Alright, so I have to go upstairs.
[04:16.54]Quick recap.
[04:17.37]I'm a household robot.
[04:18.63]I fix things.
[04:19.29]I help with the family.
[04:20.85]I put sugar in people's cups.
[04:22.73]I clean stains off the ground.
[04:25.35]Mom and dad are about to go through a divorce probably.
[04:30.47]Typical robot helper robot stuff.
[04:34.17]So we're going up to mom's room right now to find out what's going on.
[04:39.58]Which was the foyer.
[04:41.70]Which we gotta go this way.
[04:43.34]Yep.
[04:44.22]Crash.
[04:45.12]Get it.
[04:47.00]Oh yeah, and there's a dead frog outside that I could have saved four hours ago.
[04:51.12]Alright.
[04:52.78]Wait, I wanna give, um... Ribbit girl.
[04:58.16]Ribbit girl's very sad, by the way.
[05:02.57]Ribbit maybe.
[05:03.29]What is this?
[05:09.33]Is this us?
[05:10.61]Is this us?
[05:11.43]Oh, wait, I think that's the other robot.
[05:20.83]Yeah, because that's the old robot.
[05:22.83]The one that everyone was their best friend.
[05:29.23]Yay, babe.

[05:49.57]We have to collect frog rings for her.
[05:50.93]She loves them.

[06:02.21]Five more.
[06:02.55]Ribbit.
[06:09.57]Everybody loves Chibi-Robo Where's the trash can?

[06:53.79]Look at all this trash.

[07:12.19]44 happy points, holy shit.
[07:16.02]Wet to dry in one frame.
[07:17.94]Well, you can tell when I was sitting here testing and making sure it worked and everything for the first time.
[07:22.64]You can tell when that was.
[07:23.52]And it's like probably 40 minutes ago.
[07:25.98]Alright, wait, I'm gonna... Clean.
[07:38.06]See, I'm helping.
[07:39.80]As per the title of the livestream, I'm going to help.
[07:44.50]Show memory card or emulated.
[07:45.96]I don't care if you think this is emulated at this point.
[07:50.30]It's not like some thing that I'm gonna be like, how dare you?
[07:52.90]No, I don't care.
[07:54.66]If you think this is emulated, I'm glad.
[07:56.42]If you think this is on original hardware, I'm also very glad.
[07:59.54]I'm very glad about those things.
[08:03.93]I don't care.
[08:07.27]He did show the memory card.
[08:08.29]He slammed it in a door.
[08:09.73]Yeah, I did.
[08:10.57]Two days ago.
[08:11.13]Alright, it's time.
[08:18.39]It's time to go into Mom's room.
[08:20.05]What's in Mom's room?
[08:22.08]But first, let me charge.
[08:26.70]Schrodinger's emulator.
[08:34.59]This is pre-recorded.
[08:35.73]Don't stop saying that!
[08:36.95]You're gonna get me in fucking trouble.
[08:39.27]I haven't turned on an actual live broadcast in like two and a half years.
[08:44.43]Stop fucking with my game.
[08:57.34]All this is pre-recorded.
[08:58.32]I just, I sit here with it on one of my monitors.
[09:03.32]I'm watching Lost right now on my other monitor.
[09:06.04]I'm in Season 4.
[09:07.22]It gets good, right?
[09:08.22]And I just chime in sometimes.
[09:18.13]Do you want to know how to use the warp bot?
[09:20.29]Oh, yeah.
[09:20.59]This is new.
[09:23.69]Insert your plug to power it up.
[09:25.81]When the energy field appears, climb on top of the utility bot.
[09:28.45]It will automatically be transported to the other warp utility bot.
[09:31.53]Well, where is it?
[09:32.05]Let's test this.
[09:35.44]This is the foyer.
[09:37.40]It goes to... That's an adorable sound.
[09:44.02]It just goes upstairs!
[09:45.90]Oh!
[09:48.22]Wow, that's better than having to fly over on the banister.
[09:50.95]I'm really, really happy you said Season 4.
[09:58.09]It's the best season, Jerma.
[09:59.17]Thank you.
[10:00.01]I'm looking forward to it.
[10:03.58]Alright, sorry.
[10:04.00]Back to the regularly scheduled pre-recorded Jeremy.
[10:10.73]Okay.
[10:12.51]Gotta clean this up.
[10:16.53]Good, good.
[10:17.25]Are you happy points for that one?
[10:21.39]Okay.
[10:23.19]165 stains.
[10:23.95]Time for a cleaning bonus.
[10:26.11]Happy points.
[10:27.63]Oh, fuck.
[10:28.29]The reverb is on.
[10:33.76]There was a lot of reverb on there.
[10:35.24]I was trying to make it... Oh, whatever.
[10:36.62]Who cares?
[10:43.06]The reverb was dialed up a lot.
[10:46.15]I got a lot of points for that.
[10:48.81]Why does reverb equal pre-recorded?
[10:51.19]Well, because that means I've opened 30 windows within a tenth of a second of the same stream.
[10:58.62]That's what that means.
[10:59.58]Sorry, guys.
[11:00.18]I fucked it up.
[11:00.76]I'll fix it.
[11:06.37]I'm getting the trash, and I'm going to go into Mom's room.
[11:24.92]That would be a delay echo.
[11:26.74]Not if they were all opened within a tenth of a second.
[11:33.32]You'd hear a lot of reverb.
[11:41.13]He's wrong.
[11:41.71]Wrong.
[11:41.95]I'm an audio engineer.
[11:42.79]I went to school for audio engineering.
[11:44.63]I think I know what I'm talking about.
[11:59.86]So did I.
[12:10.74]Show degree?
[12:14.20]Well, I never said I graduated.
[12:15.38]I said I went.
[12:16.06]I mean, I did pretty poorly and had been stopped after about two classes.
[12:22.16]Alright, let's go in mom's room.
[12:25.80]Let's find out what's going on.
[12:35.03]It's time.
[12:36.13]We're gonna find out what's in here.
[12:39.55]Here we go.
[12:50.75]He was a neat.
[12:53.17]Alright, bedroom, new area.
[12:56.58]What is the secret in here?
[12:57.78]There's a frog.
[13:00.94]Specifically, there's an alive frog right here.
[13:05.70]It's dead too.
[13:06.40]Why are there dead frogs everywhere?
[13:22.41]What's that?
[13:23.43]Let's go and have a closer look.
[13:25.39]It looks like a frog.
[13:26.97]But how horrible.
[13:27.71]Who could have done such a thing?
[13:29.11]You think it could have been Tao?
[13:47.80]I mean, maybe the dog could have picked it up and thrown it around.
[13:51.66]Probably.
[13:51.96]I mean, it's possible.
[13:52.78]I don't know.
[13:56.52]I mean... I don't know.
[14:02.85]I can't jump to conclusions like that.
[14:04.23]I don't know.
[14:06.29]Yeah, you're right.
[14:07.15]He already has plenty of food and bones and stuff.
[14:11.32]I mean, who could have?
[14:13.14]Huh?
[14:13.40]Huh?
[14:18.26]There's a Tyrannosaurus Rex stuffed animal in this room.
[14:24.89]Ch-ch-ch-Chibi-Robo, there's something over there!
[14:26.89]What are you talking about?
[14:32.23]There's nothing there, Telly.
[14:34.51]Wait a minute.
[14:38.66]There really was something over there.
[14:39.88]I'm gonna go take a look.
[14:47.45]Okay, so, just another dead frog.
[14:52.81]I don't know what to do.
[15:04.92]Poor guy.
[15:05.58]Yeah, what am I supposed to do?
[15:06.66]I need water.
[15:08.16]Alright, we gotta get a good, we gotta make a perimeter here.
[15:12.02]Ticket stub.
[15:12.60]Wait.
[15:13.04]Can I drag this?
[15:17.54]Save him.
[15:18.22]I can't!
[15:20.73]Holy shit, I'm strong.
[15:22.83]What's in here?
[15:23.25]Can I open up the briefcase?
[15:27.97]There's probably something in the briefcase, right?
[15:35.59]Charge the frog.
[15:36.51]That's not gonna help.
[15:38.19]Let me clean under the bed first and we'll figure it out.
[15:44.14]What's this?
[15:47.85]I'm very expensive, okay?
[15:51.85]Well, we knew that.
[15:56.47]Charge the frog.
[15:57.35]Charge the frog.
[15:58.85]If I put the plug near that frog, it's gonna zap him and kill him.
[16:03.23]So, no.
[16:09.02]Why would I use a defib on a frog that's currently breathing?
[16:13.26]The frog's... That's not the point.
[16:15.14]What are you talking about?
[16:20.99]Why would I use a defib on a frog that's awake and alert and breathing and has a heartbeat?
[16:29.71]He's just thirsty.
[16:30.64]And there's another one outside that's also thirsty.
[16:32.88]I just need thirsty... I need to... I can't wake him up!
[16:35.64]What do you want me to do?
[16:45.76]Absorb his power!
[16:47.18]Alright, I gotta look for some other stuff in here.
[16:53.71]How about, um... Wait, I can go on top of this?
[16:58.05]Can I?
[16:58.39]Can I drag this all the way over?
[16:59.87]How far can I bring this?
[17:02.09]I can't jump on top of here?
[17:06.71]It won't open if you don't know the correct password.
[17:11.11]Ah, we need the pa- This is the secret right here.
[17:17.36]That's the secret we need.
[17:18.28]To know the password.
[17:20.18]We've got to find out.
[17:20.76]We've got to get the password from Mom.
[17:22.46]Right?
[17:22.66]Alright, in the meantime, let me go over here.
[17:28.96]Isn't Mom going to know that I... That somebody was in... Looking in the briefcase?
[17:33.98]Wait, what about the shoes?
[17:36.70]Anything hidden?
[17:46.37]Point.
[17:51.36]Pull it out.
[17:51.70]I'm gonna pull this out.
[17:53.72]Is there a bug up here?
[17:56.90]Ooh, there's a demon door.
[18:00.97]Mom's gonna give us her password.
[18:06.77]Oh, there's a lot of trash on Mom's desk.
[18:15.93]Jerma, what's your social?
[18:18.01]Oh, that's easy.
[18:20.03]0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 1.
[18:22.61]I was the first person.
[18:29.00]Can I get up there?
[18:37.26]I have to climb.
[18:42.28]Same joke years later.
[18:44.10]PogChamp.
[18:49.67]Dude, PogChamp.
[18:50.57]Remember when he did that, like, in 2014?
[18:54.75]Probably.
[18:55.33]I don't know.
[18:55.81]Is Mom gonna be mad that I'm in the bedroom cleaning?
[19:05.39]Alright, let's get a good view.
[19:07.75]Alright, we got a dead frog.
[19:12.76]This other side.
[19:13.60]Ticket stub.
[19:16.04]Holy shit.
[19:17.26]Look at all those doors up there.
[19:22.44]Alright, I'm gonna try to... How do I get up there?
[19:24.54]That's a lot.
[19:28.56]Get on the fan.
[19:29.16]Get on the fan.
[19:29.66]Get on the fan.
[19:30.36]I mean, I can't right now.
[19:32.02]I gotta find a way up there.
[19:34.77]Let's do the baseline stuff first.
[19:37.39]I go over there.
[19:38.29]I gotta get up there.
[19:39.31]On the windowsill.
[19:41.07]What is that?
[19:45.06]What the hell is that?
[19:45.72]Alright, investigate.
[20:03.27]Mission, you need to recharge your- yeah, me.
[20:06.65]I need to recharge me, you're right.
[20:08.76]That's a good tip.
[20:09.90]Alright, can I get up there?
[20:13.46]Can I climb anything over this way?
[20:17.10]Are these ladders?
[20:18.54]Yes, they are.
[20:19.20]He almost fell for it.
[20:24.76]Almost.
[20:27.25]You got a key word there.
[20:28.99]Almost.
[20:29.55]Did I turn the radio on?
[20:33.57]Did I turn on the turntable?
[20:36.13]I should be able to.
[20:36.77]Alright, who the hell is this?
[20:47.06]I pull the thing and... Hmm.
[20:54.11]I can't grab that.
[20:54.73]There's like a flower freaking out over here.
[20:59.13]I gotta open up the window.
[20:59.99]I can't get up there?
[21:07.10]Can I shoot it?
[21:08.98]Yeah, look.
[21:13.36]It's right there.
[21:13.84]Can I dislodge it?
[21:14.60]Maybe I can dislodge it.
[21:27.80]Shit.
[21:28.96]I wanna get up there.
[21:31.10]Oh well.
[21:34.02]Can I climb anything else?
[21:39.88]Hey, let me in!
[21:43.82]Oh well.
[21:45.06]Uh, maybe I need something else.
[21:47.24]What's this?
[21:57.13]I can't interact with the big speaker thing?
[22:03.84]Hmm.
[22:10.32]Hmm.
[22:15.02]Shit.
[22:15.84]I need the... I need the big... I need the ladder.
[22:18.68]I think that... I need the... Okay, there's a briefcase in here, but I can't do anything with the briefcase.
[22:33.97]I guess I can land on this.
[22:37.29]Anything on here?
[22:48.09]Can't climb this.
[22:49.86]Oh, well.
[22:51.24]Oh, wait, what's that?
[22:52.80]Look at that.
[22:54.12]We need the passcode for the briefcase, but I can pull this.
[23:00.40]Is this the blinds?
[23:09.82]A hat?
[23:13.78]Oh.
[23:15.44]It looks like you can use this to climb up.
[23:18.20]Alright, well.
[23:18.92]Go water the frog.
[23:22.09]I can't.
[23:22.43]I don't have a means to.
[23:23.15]Woody Woodpecker charge noise.
[23:31.77]That's pretty good.
[23:44.23]I love it.
[23:44.65]Alright, let's climb up this ship.
[23:55.27]I hate that woodpecker.
[23:56.39]Why?
[23:56.51]Why do you hate Woody Woodpecker?
[24:03.61]How do you even hate Woody Woodpecker?
[24:05.07]It doesn't make any sense.
[24:05.74]Why?
[24:06.10]Bell?
[24:13.50]Ring the bell.
[24:15.04]Wait a minute.
[24:18.91]This is gonna... Can I stand on it?
[24:33.70]This is... I can't hit it.
[24:35.12]I'm trying to ring it.
[24:43.10]Oh.
[24:47.16]What does that do?
[24:49.68]Is somebody going to come open the door?
[24:57.22]Uh... Ticket stub.
[25:04.85]Can I fly from here?
[25:05.69]No, I definitely can't fly from here.
[25:07.11]I'm just going to land on the... I mean, I rang the bell.
[25:11.54]Hello?
[25:12.80]Hello?
[25:21.56]The fuck is this?
[25:23.78]Who lives in here?
[25:27.80]You opened the peephole.
[25:30.03]Now you can pass through here at night.
[25:33.59]Oh, now I can come in here at night.
[25:36.15]Shortcut.
[25:37.57]Nice.
[25:37.95]Alright, well how do I... Can I climb up this?
[25:46.40]Look at this.
[25:46.90]Oh yeah, look at that.
[25:51.13]Frog ring over there.
[25:51.81]Alright, I'm gonna go fly over this way?
[25:59.28]No, I can't make it.
[26:00.20]Alright, well, I'll come back at night.
[26:09.13]Let me see where this goes.
[26:13.37]Oh, shit.
[26:14.09]How do I... Okay, then I can climb up... Okay, I can climb up the... this thing over here?
[26:19.41]Let me see.
[26:21.27]Yeah, so I can climb that all the way up.
[26:22.99]Good.
[26:23.47]Good enough.
[26:26.21]Alright, cool.
[26:30.09]Did I miss anything else in the kid's room?
[26:44.89]Yes, you did.
[26:45.95]Well, let's go take a look.
[26:47.05]Primer didn't wink.
[26:53.54]I fucking, I have a thing that tells me if there's winks, the winks are real and... I didn't even look.
[27:00.74]I just believed you.
[27:01.50]For no reason.
[27:02.28]I have a... Is today the last wink day?
[27:09.04]No.
[27:09.12]No.
[27:09.30]It's gonna be a day or two.
[27:15.08]Like, it's gonna be Tuesday.
[27:17.24]It's the last day for winks.
[27:20.46]And they're gonna be significantly reduced in price.
[27:36.76]Alright, let me, uh, do something smart.
[27:39.06]We could go talk to the Frankenstein guy.
[27:42.76]Hold on.
[27:43.30]I'm so...
[28:06.35]Almost out of time, though.
[28:07.81]I end up with this trash.
[28:08.93]I see trash, and I need to get it.
[28:12.21]I'm obsessed with trash.
[28:14.41]I'm obsessed with it.
[28:17.35]Look, it's wasting time, but I have to open this and go get it.
[28:23.57]You see?
[28:24.05]I've wasted so much time, I have to pick up every piece of trash.
[28:26.95]Get it!
[28:36.98]I think I leveled up, too.
[28:37.70]Alright, it's night time.
[28:43.34]We can go into Mom's Urban Night.
[28:47.48]Great work out there.
[28:49.02]Let's adjust your happy points.
[28:53.31]What about my ranking?
[28:56.63]I am now in the top 10 of all chibi robos in the world.
[29:02.71]Special gift, a brand new bonus battery. 1800?
[29:08.25]Yeah, 880.
[29:11.49]So good.
[29:13.63]Top 10 chibi.
[29:14.79]I do have money though.
[29:15.43]Let's see what I want to spend it on.
[29:16.64]Top chibi streamer.
[29:17.96]Speech, speech!
[29:34.44]Guys, I just want to say, I never would have got here if it wasn't for all of you leaving your cans and bottles scattered throughout the house and not walking even two feet to the trash can.
[29:50.57]And for dropping oil all over the ground and never cleaning the vents above your stove.
[29:56.71]Without this, I never would have made it.
[30:02.75]Thank you, everybody.
[30:07.91]Range chip?
[30:15.10]Passive aggressive speech?
[30:17.72]Well, start cleaning!
[30:21.54]How's that for aggressive aggressive?
[30:27.30]Alright, I'm gonna get the range chip.
[30:30.31]Fire long-distance blaster shots.
[30:35.39]I want it.
[30:37.82]And I also want another battery, too.
[30:39.48]Yep.
[30:46.78]Kitchen bridge.
[30:49.19]A bridge that stretches far, placed near the planter.
[30:51.63]Alright, I got... I got so much to do.
[31:01.52]You're an asshole.
[31:02.26]You made my daughter cry.
[31:07.38]What?
[31:13.98]Alright.
[31:15.36]Let's put the rest in here.
[31:44.19]I tried to do it exact.
[31:46.15]And I got caught.
[31:46.91]Alright, uh, I can only have to do it a thousand at a time.
[31:55.01]You're doing D.Va.
[31:58.88]D.Va is Elmo.
[32:01.84]Is Gollum.
[32:04.14]We want shit.
[32:05.20]We need shit.
[32:06.66]D.Va, reporting for duty.
[32:08.22]It's also one of the Ed Brothers.
[32:09.95]It could be anyone, Eddie.
[32:12.39]It could even be Elmo.
[32:24.65]Can be anybody.
[32:35.39]+2.
[32:36.05]Hire him.
[32:38.05]Something about being available.
[32:39.15]Alright, let's go to, uh... Let's go to Mom's room at night.
[32:44.07]Mom's room at night.
[32:44.61]Where's the warper?
[32:48.23]In the foyer.
[32:48.65]Behind me.
[33:06.65]I can't stop thinking about Woody Woodpecker.
[33:08.89]Fuck.
[33:11.62]Yeah, it was a great reference.
[33:17.14]Great.
[33:22.96]It really is.
[33:23.68]Let's hear it again.
[33:38.29]No, uh... I love it.
[33:47.92]I can't wait to hear it again.
[33:51.94]Alright, into mom's room.
[34:01.45]Anything new?
[34:02.25]Okay, teddy bear.
[34:03.09]I went into mom's room.
[34:07.01]Mom locks the door at night.
[34:09.49]But she leaves the door open all day.
[34:16.34]I'll handle this.
[34:21.26]Diva Golem double D Elmo quad impression.
[34:25.01]Why did you even clip that?
[34:29.07]Wrong door!
[34:38.14]Does this change at night or something?
[34:40.34]Is mom just in here sleeping?
[34:54.53]Is there anything we do?
[34:56.35]Like, is there something we can do while mom is asleep?
[34:58.81]Like, go in her drawer and find a key?
[35:01.43]I don't understand.
[35:02.25]Why would I do this at night?
[35:06.15]Does mom like bring like this password up here and put it somewhere?
[35:09.20]I don't understand.
[35:23.77]Well, we're gonna find out.
[35:24.57]What are we going to do?
[35:36.73]These bills are piling up.
[35:39.63]On top of that, the electric bill has skyrocketed.
[35:42.09]See, I am a problem.
[35:46.83]He's just hopeless.
[35:54.03]Okay, we need to... Should I just... What if I make... What if I make my presence known?
[36:01.96]What is that up there?
[36:07.31]Wait a minute, what is that?
[36:08.75]You see this thing?
[36:11.67]What is this?
[36:12.13]It's like a secret.
[36:17.31]Hi, Mom.
[36:25.61]Uh, is it something... Should I make my presence known?
[36:29.65]Say hello?
[36:30.95]Uh, yeah, I guess I could.
[36:34.11]Say hi?
[36:37.85]Hey there, Chibo.
[36:38.97]How'd you get in here?
[36:42.04]Did you come to check on me because you were worried about me?
[36:45.00]Yes.
[36:47.78]Thank you, Chibo. 52!
[36:57.65]I bet Jenny and her dad asked you to check up on me.
[37:00.99]Well, since you're here, would you mind keeping me company?
[37:04.06]I'm balancing our checkbook, but something just doesn't add up.
[37:06.76]Uh-oh, you want me to do math?
[37:08.72]I'm exhausted.
[37:09.48]I wonder if there's a toy receipt I'm missing.
[37:12.18]I bet he's hiding one somewhere.
[37:14.98]It was a receipt.
[37:17.58]I asked him about it earlier, and he said, Don't worry, you have all... That was a great impression.
[37:23.16]When it comes to toys, I don't know if I can trust him to have any self-control.
[37:27.32]Oh, can you do me a favor, Chibo?
[37:28.46]See if you can find a hidden toy receipt.
[37:30.20]I think I know where it is.
[37:31.99]Bring it back to me if you find one.
[37:35.45]If you do, my husband will have explaining to do.
[37:38.23]Isn't it, like, right here?
[37:38.93]Chibi-Robo, crazy mo- A hidden toy receipt!
[37:46.13]Shit.
[37:49.05]That's not it.
[37:50.95]Oh, Mom, you gonna do anything about the dying frog in the middle of the room?
[37:56.69]He's just sleeping.
[37:57.41]No, I don't have it in my inventory.
[38:03.78]It's hidden somewhere.
[38:04.96]It's in a receipt.
[38:06.48]For a toy.
[38:16.22]Let me check up here for a second.
[38:18.26]I still throw my trash away.
[38:19.36]I have a lot of it.
[38:21.94]Anything over here?
[38:28.45]I thought those were Pop-Tarts in a toaster.
[38:30.11]That's my actually mutated brain.
[38:33.61]Just thought that.
[38:34.13]I was like, oh, Pop-Tarts in a toaster!
[38:52.21]Let's plug it.
[38:52.65]Let's go into the other room.
[38:57.85]You're my help.
[38:58.31]I can't connect.
[38:59.97]You're connected.
[39:00.49]You're right here.
[39:01.05]Alright, a toy receipt.
[39:10.59]Where does Dad even hang out?
[39:11.73]Does Dad only hang out on the sofa?
[39:16.06]Is that it?
[39:25.16]On the toilet.
[39:29.04]Dad hangs out in the bathroom?
[39:34.31]He saw the receipt already.
[39:36.33]Well, that... No, that was the Chibi-Robo one.
[39:38.18]That's not the right one.
[39:56.38]Dad lives in the walls.
[39:57.86]It's a wall dad.
[39:58.78]Oh, God.
[40:09.37]Let's go back.
[40:09.71]I want to go back into Jenny's room.
[40:11.21]I didn't explore everything in Jenny's room.
[40:13.75]I picked up trash and had to leave.
[40:15.77]I wish I could use the Stuart Little car, but that's unfortunate.
[40:18.49]I can't.
[40:18.99]Why?
[40:34.88]Why is she so sad?
[40:36.58]Well, she's upset that her parents are not getting along.
[40:41.56]It's kind of sad.
[40:42.28]It's actually really sad.
[40:58.03]I'd hate to see their electric bill.
[40:59.39]Yeah, she was talking about it.
[41:05.13]Alright, what do we got?
[41:06.87]Okay, thank god.
[41:08.51]Let's dump all this crap.
[41:09.49]I have a lot of it.
[41:12.00]Look at that.
[41:12.58]Like, five wrappers.
[41:13.64]A can of orange juice.
[41:17.90]Party poppers.
[41:23.09]Wads of junk.
[41:23.79]Almost at 1500.
[41:28.87]Aww.
[41:43.76]Okay.
[41:43.96]What are you doing here?
[41:54.60]Hello, Space Hunter Robo.
[41:56.66]Look at that.
[41:59.42]That towering castle.
[42:02.02]And all the way at the top of it.
[42:04.26]What do I see?
[42:05.10]Ah ha ha.
[42:07.70]A delightful damsel.
[42:12.16]He gazes down at me with lost eyes.
[42:14.22]I can tell her heart aches for justice.
[42:17.48]Listen, Jump King.
[42:22.16]Space Hunter Code.
[42:23.51]Yeah, he's gonna jump up to that table and try to jump to the microwave and fall five times.
[42:33.91]And then fucking leave.
[42:35.39]Be like, never mind!
[42:36.31]This game sucks!
[42:38.90]Drake Redcrest must speak to her.
[42:40.80]She needs my attention.
[42:44.65]However, a minor obstacle stands in my way.
[42:46.29]How am I supposed to get up there?
[42:51.07]One called Mort will know what to do.
[42:52.64]I am at a loss, but the destiny of a space hunter is to find the truth.
[42:57.42]Alright, well, hold on.
[43:02.72]Let me just get up here.
[43:06.30]Wait, is he talking about the guy under the bed?
[43:07.86]Is he talking about the Frankenstein guy under the bed?
[43:16.39]was a syringe?
[43:20.13]That's a squirter from a doctor's kit.
[43:23.15]It's probably Jenny's.
[43:24.95]Looks like you can pull up water with it.
[43:26.97]Bingo.
[43:28.74]You can spray it on all sorts of things.
[43:31.02]We just saved the frog.
[43:37.84]Wow.
[43:38.46]Yes.
[43:38.88]Okay.
[43:39.28]Cool.
[43:49.04]Oh, is this TV?
[43:53.49]Ooh!
[43:54.17]What is it?
[43:54.53]That was a really good show.
[44:07.67]I love the part when the bear got mad at the honey not being in there.
[44:19.62]Hang it on top of the TV?
[44:20.66]Uh... I still have time to explore in here, why not?
[44:41.60]Bear actually mad.
[44:43.74]Bear actually... Wait, that was telling me something.
[44:50.82]No, you can't just jump.
[45:04.70]The bear was mad about the pot.
[45:05.96]There's music.
[45:20.56]Okay, well, um, let's get up here.
[45:28.73]Red shoe.
[45:31.71]What is this?
[45:36.46]Whose shoe is this?
[45:37.18]Is it a mushroom?
[45:40.48]Oh, it's a brake mushroom.
[45:50.86]You shouldn't be slacking off.
[45:57.43]Get back in there, champ.
[46:11.62]I can't get over there.
[46:12.52]Can I go down here?
[46:16.80]I can maybe sneak in this.
[46:19.73]If I hover, I think I can sneak in there.
[46:24.03]Yeah, I can.
[46:27.78]I definitely can.
[46:28.80]Do I even need to?
[46:29.44]I don't think I even need to.
[46:37.92]What the fuck did I just clip through?
[46:41.78]What?
[46:44.66]Alright, man.
[46:45.26]What the fuck are you talking about?
[46:47.53]Why am I clipping through this?
[47:06.05]Dermato.
[47:07.73]Toe.
[47:08.33]What?
[47:08.97]Toe.
[47:09.37]Toe.
[47:09.83]Toe.
[47:10.23]Toe.
[47:10.83]Toe?
[47:12.77]Toe.
[47:13.05]Why is everyone saying toe?
[47:15.15]I don't get it.
[47:24.36]You're confusing him.
[47:25.18]Yeah, you are.
[47:27.14]Very much so.
[47:27.78]I don't know what you're even talking about.
[47:33.02]Let's go talk to this guy.
[47:36.36]Oh, someone did a juke with a toe.
[47:38.49]Okay.
[47:40.87]I get it, I guess.
[47:42.85]Although I don't.
[47:44.11]I'm gonna pretend I get it.
[47:46.99]Let's talk to the mummy again.
[47:48.99]Safety is an illusion, but my shoebox under the bed makes me feel safe day or night.
[48:03.47]What's that?
[48:04.85]I forgot.
[48:06.48]Let me introduce myself.
[48:08.56]I am Mort.
[48:10.24]Will you listen to my story?
[48:12.66]Yeah.
[48:17.14]It's about the other night.
[48:33.52]Why is the bear attacking?
[48:34.62]Stop, stop!
[48:36.18]You're gonna break it!
[48:37.16]Okay, I got that.
[48:42.97]That's the shoe for the girl up there.
[48:47.12]What?!
[48:47.24]You've got the red shoe?! !
[49:17.68]I've got the red shoe.
[49:19.56]Come back up.
[49:21.19]It's really elaborate and probably a pain in the ass to get in and out of here.
[49:23.87]I don't know why you didn't ask first.
[49:28.94]Did you find the shoe?
[49:30.10]There it is.
[49:36.56]Yes!
[49:40.01]Hurry up and give it to Princess Pits!
[49:43.06]I can't go into the castle because my body won't fit.
[49:45.66]Another one of life's little disappointments.
[49:49.92]I put a flight of stairs in front of the castle.
[49:52.10]Go ahead and use it!
[49:52.88]Oh shit.
[49:55.86]They gave us a way out.
[50:03.51]What's a button on the back of you do?
[50:11.33]Alright, let's charge up and then try to go up to the top of the castle.
[50:19.71]Oh, I need an outlet.
[50:20.97]Where's an outlet?
[50:22.25]Only one outlet in this whole room.
[50:25.78]This is bad bedroom design.
[50:28.02]One outlet.
[50:29.64]All the way over here.
[50:39.04]Take it out.
[50:53.01]Can you play the piano?
[50:59.57]Is it a battery?
[51:00.35]Ooh.
[51:01.95]I'm going to be able to get that.
[51:06.19]I can't pick those up.
[51:06.81]Here we go.
[51:08.83]Let's make our way up.
[51:10.26]This is going to be a puzzle.
[51:14.06]Not really.
[51:14.50]Not that big of a deal.
[51:19.24]Now, what is this?
[51:21.18]Battery.
[51:23.57]Double A battery.
[51:24.23]Okay, more items.
[51:28.19]Can I jump from here to there?
[51:29.13]Nope.
[51:29.99]I don't know if this is like Zelda or something, where if I got to the edge, I just did it.
[51:44.80]Okay.
[51:47.94]What?
[51:50.10]Ooh!
[51:50.42]Okay, pull these.
[51:57.77]And then... Can I... Ooh!
[52:02.05]Jump onto the heart thing.
[52:04.43]And we float.
[52:05.09]This really is Jump King.
[52:12.56]What's this?
[52:14.55]This is where you insert a AA battery.
[52:17.67]Ah.
[52:26.46]Nice.
[52:26.82]Oh, I wanted to hear the whole song.
[52:38.15]I wonder, should I... I was gonna get on his head.
[52:43.77]And then we can float from here.
[52:47.54]This game is so cute.
[52:48.42]It really is.
[52:48.88]It's just adorable.
[52:50.34]The whole thing.
[52:56.86]Alright, keep going.
[53:01.11]Dude, I just smoked like two grams.
[53:02.95]What the fuck is this?
[53:04.23]Dude, I just smoked two grams!
[53:13.75]No one said that.
[53:14.67]Yes, they did.
[53:15.47]They said, man, I just smoked two grams.
[53:18.44]What the fuck?
[53:24.64]Why?
[53:25.56]Why?
[53:25.84]I don't need that info.
[53:27.34]I don't need, I mean, that's fine, but I don't, I don't need that info.
[53:31.86]Should I go left or right?
[53:39.25]Go right.
[53:41.67]Oh, the... Gosh!
[53:44.97]The... The perspective... It was just wrong.
[54:01.63]Back to the sewer.
[54:24.82]Okay, we're good.
[54:41.47]I need another battery!
[54:42.41]I need another battery?
[54:45.33]Fuck.
[54:46.37]Where's another AA battery?
[54:59.27]D Battery.
[55:06.38]Shit.
[55:08.32]Where's our D Battery?
[55:17.50]Oh, man!
[55:41.84]I'm gonna have to do it tomorrow.
[55:45.91]Shit.
[55:46.19]Throw the trash away.
[55:52.11]I need a D battery.
[55:54.59]Is that in here?
[55:55.65]It's probably on the other side.
[55:56.63]I just went the wrong way.
[55:57.79]I went right instead of left.
[56:03.25]End of the stream voice.
[56:06.15]I just started like 45 minutes ago.
[56:08.71]What are you talking about?
[56:14.55]Oh, because I keep saying tomorrow.
[56:15.71]I'm going to have to say in the game.
[56:17.05]Coin?
[56:29.87]I'm going to go down the slide too.
[56:33.47]Cool, you ready?
[56:39.26]Oh, I did the slide wrong.
[56:41.26]I'm actually annoyed by that.
[56:46.06]Okay, water.
[56:46.62]I gotta get water.
[56:47.12]Wait!
[56:52.90]What's in here?
[56:53.74]Why is it like this?
[56:56.72]Cat can't distinguish the game and reality.
[57:11.96]Irma's an eggplant head.
[57:13.68]What the hell is that?
[57:15.96]What's that thing on your... 20.
[57:17.87]What's this 20?
[57:19.27]TwitchCon Amsterdam.
[57:22.73]Eggplant head.
[57:23.23]Eggplant head.
[57:37.58]That's like when kids first learn the word eggplant.
[57:40.24]They start calling each other eggplant head.
[57:43.18]Eggplant head!
[57:44.24]Eggplant head!
[57:45.12]It's because they just found out what that word was.
[57:48.53]They ate it like three days ago.
[58:00.19]Eggplant head.
[58:05.32]Stop it!
[58:05.78]Stop calling me that!
[58:08.13]If Jerma reads this out loud, I'll do 20 push-ups and 50 squats.
[58:11.47]Good luck!
[58:12.11]Go for it!
[58:28.76]Okay.
[58:33.44]Back to what we were doing.
[58:36.18]No, I want water.
[58:37.12]Where do I get water?
[58:39.33]Can I get it from the sink?
[58:41.77]If my wife ever finds out, I'm in huge trouble.
[58:49.65]This should be a safe place.
[58:56.49]Alright, the receipt is in the couch.
[59:06.02]Receipt in couch, I'm going to get it.
[59:10.17]Getting it, Dad.
[59:11.53]I'm going to get that chip right now.
[59:15.47]Dad, I'm gonna get that.
[59:16.71]Wait, I gotta... I'm over... I'm too excited to, like... Like, I'm too excited to snitch on Dad.
[59:22.60]Hold on.
[59:22.96]Hold on.
[59:42.50]There it is.
[59:45.62]He really doesn't go anywhere besides the couch, does he?
[59:48.64]Let's get the crumbs.
[59:56.47]Oh!
[59:58.03]What's wrong, Chibi-Robo?
[59:59.97]Toy receipt?
[60:00.95]I have no idea what you're talking about, silly robot.
[60:04.83]Oh, by the way.
[60:05.41]The room looks really clean today.
[60:07.98]You must have worked so hard.
[60:22.01]No, no, no, no, no!
[60:25.69]You found it!
[60:26.93]Ew!
[60:27.69]Well, don't tell my wife, alright?
[60:29.17]Uh-oh.
[60:33.20]I want to pick the trash up.
[60:37.54]Why would it be ew?
[60:44.04]Alright, we gotta go to Mom's room at night.
[60:47.38]We gotta show her.
[60:52.87]Do I have any more of those things?
[61:03.30]I don't have any more of those things.
[61:08.64]Rings.
[61:09.00]No.
[61:16.28]Yawn.
[61:16.66]Man, the news is boring.
[61:18.72]What a snore fest.
[61:19.66]Hey, Chibi.
[61:20.84]Can you change the channel, buddy?
[61:27.33]The amount of work it takes for me to change the channel on the TV is astronomical.
[61:31.99]Do you see how small I am and how little this- how much is it gonna take me to do this?
[61:37.07]This is gonna take me so long to do this.
[61:40.22]I have to go get my ladder.
[61:41.86]You can't just sit up and press a button.
[61:47.34]Look at what- I want you to watch this whole time.
[61:50.08]Dad.
[61:50.34]I don't even know where it is.
[61:52.14]Where's my, uh, elevator?
[62:01.37]I have to go... I'm gonna do it.
[62:02.69]It's a happy point.
[62:04.66]Save the frog.
[62:06.34]Frog comes after TV.
[62:07.86]Don't worry.
[62:15.63]No, it doesn't.
[62:16.73]Yes, it does, because I'm currently in the room.
[62:19.55]Look, let me just change this lazy motherfucker's TV channel.
[62:32.75]Imagine watching this from the couch.
[62:37.09]TV Robo.
[62:38.07]Yes?

[64:21.13]Fuck you, Dad.
[64:21.69]I'm going back to the news.
[64:35.60]Wait, no!
[64:36.54]No, stop!
[64:37.72]Put it back!
[64:38.82]Put it back!
[64:39.82]No, no, keep it on the news.
[64:44.47]No!
[64:50.21]You piece of shit!
[64:53.69]How will I ever be able to change it again?
[64:56.59]Oh, look at him mocking me!
[65:02.82]Look at it mocking me.
[65:04.04]How dare you?
[65:05.74]Piece of shit.
[65:09.96]And then all of a sudden, from above the screen, SMASH!
[65:13.84]A fucking shoe, a foot crushes JPRobo.
[65:20.04]Alright, can I get water out here?
[65:26.43]I don't think so.
[65:30.62]Alright, I did what Dad wanted.
[65:31.80]Let's plug in and let's go back.
[65:33.64]I love this game.
[65:34.22]There's so much to do.
[65:37.08]Bad ending.
[65:37.74]Yeah, and then it just shows Dad going into the store with a receipt.
[65:48.38]Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with it.
[65:51.38]Um, okay, you're just returning it?
[65:53.08]Yeah, it just stopped working.
[65:55.86]There's a priest missing, I think.
[65:57.98]Okay, thank you for the return in exchange.
[66:00.90]Yep.
[66:08.24]Uh, yes, Alex, I'll take every single time someone's ever returned something to a store for 500, please.
[66:18.59]Stop throwing shit at me.
[66:27.01]This happened five times.
[66:28.29]Yeah, why are you keeping track of how many times people have thrown dinner plates at me?
[66:32.49]Oh, whatever.
[66:40.58]Let's go.
[66:43.32]Because it's funny.
[66:44.28]Alright, we're going to the... What do I want to do?
[66:52.18]During the day, we've got to go back to mom at night.
[66:54.92]So I do have access to the kitchen.
[66:57.68]Because I've got the ladder for the kitchen.
[67:03.71]You can give it to her in the day.
[67:04.73]Oh, you can?
[67:08.29]Go to the sink.
[67:09.15]There's no water in the sink.
[67:14.82]Alright, where's the thing that I bought?
[67:16.20]I just bought it.
[67:19.12]Where is it?
[67:24.40]Is it- is it- oh, it's up- it's up on top?
[67:28.45]Why is it up on top?
[67:29.21]Okay, well, we have to get up there.
[67:34.47]Hold on.
[67:39.25]Did I already go up- I think I did this already, but... Worth a shot.
[67:43.80]It's to reach the spoon, ahaha.
[67:49.66]This tiny husband video is weird.
[67:58.41]Tiny Husband?
[68:05.71]It's a Tiny Husband video.
[68:08.74]Why does it have to be a video?
[68:11.00]What do you mean?
[68:12.06]Oh, and I guess it is a stream, but... Tiny Husband!
[68:20.59]Alright, what do we got?
[68:27.21]Mom can just put us up there, can't she?
[68:39.70]Step on the lever of the toaster?
[68:40.98]I just tried.
[68:49.03]So did you find the toy receipt?
[68:51.75]This is important.
[68:54.23]Do we, um...
[68:58.88]Do we say we'd sit?
[69:00.40]Yes, we do.
[69:03.04]Sorry.
[69:03.54]I mean, come on.
[69:04.62]We got so... Hot Rod.
[69:06.60]Where's the receipt?
[69:10.51]The husband... We gotta get this figured out.
[69:12.37]The husband's... Really, there's a lot of fault that has to lay on the husband here.
[69:19.59]She said he spends all their money on toys.
[69:23.27]I mean... We gotta stop that.
[69:29.25]Another Red Crest toy?
[69:30.79]I told him that these toys are a waste of money.
[69:39.34]Doesn't he listen?
[69:39.98]Is he deaf?
[69:43.30]My husband is so stupid!
[69:50.11]Thank you, Chibo.
[69:50.89]I think that was worth more than 30.
[70:00.29]Spread the happiness.
[70:01.09]Aren't I spreading sadness in this course?
[70:06.71]I've had it with that man.
[70:07.84]He can do the housework himself then.
[70:10.98]I don't even want to look at him.
[70:12.52]Spread the happiness.
[70:14.72]Forget this.
[70:15.02]I'm going to lock myself in my room.
[70:21.49]You want to explain this?
[70:22.85]Oh, where did you find that, sweetie?
[70:27.21]Doesn't matter where I got it.
[70:28.41]Another toy?
[70:29.09]What is wrong with you?
[70:30.89]That's it.
[70:31.29]I've had enough of this family.
[70:33.01]I'm locking myself in the bedroom.
[70:39.45]Oh man, I'm in a world of hurt!
[70:45.43]Spreading happiness!
[70:55.72]Happiness being spread.
[70:57.95]Tearing entire family apart.
[71:01.81]Oh shit.
[71:03.59]Uh, okay.
[71:05.17]I gotta get up here.
[71:06.03]I just need a spoon.
[71:15.62]Is it all your fault?
[71:18.02]It's not all my fault.
[71:20.08]They're hiding things from each other.
[71:21.44]They're lying to each other.
[71:25.93]Like this was gonna fester for another 10 more years?
[71:28.59]No.
[71:31.61]Wait, can I suck this up?
[71:39.61]Water.
[71:41.03]Yeah!
[71:41.56]Alright, put it away.
[71:50.88]Is this like soapy water though?
[71:52.38]Am I gonna spray soapy water into a frog's mouth?
[71:57.03]It's all like there's chemicals in this shit.
[71:58.41]There's like chlorine in this water.
[72:00.05]Frogs can't have chlorine.
[72:03.29]Alright, let's do this.

[88:00.75]The frog seems to be saying something.
[88:01.79]I don't understand this strange language.
[88:04.69]Chat, look what you made me do!
[88:05.93]What the fuck?!
[88:11.81]Frog suit.
[88:12.98]Well, I'll never take this off.
[88:18.32]Okay, thank you.
[88:19.26]Ribbit, I'm fine now, thanks to you.
[88:24.00]My boyfriend's lost in that house, and I'm tired of waiting around.
[88:29.28]Now that you're one of us, you can speak Ribbitice too.
[88:33.92]Cool, huh?
[88:34.56]Isn't it just the greatest?
[88:36.18]Now that we can communicate, I have to ask you a favor.
[88:42.70]If you find him, I want you to bring him here.
[88:45.71]Okay.
[88:45.87]Super frog!
[88:58.94]Okay, so what a great costume this is.
[89:02.32]I know where he is.
[89:07.58]Show Jenny the frog suit.
[89:08.79]Show Jenny the frog suit.
[89:11.67]I will, after I do some cleaning.
[89:26.61]Who cares about cleaning?
[89:27.43]This is a frog game.
[89:28.41]This is a cleaning game with frogs in it.
[89:31.67]Sorry, I have to correct when people are wrong. ...
[89:58.01]This is a frog cleaning game.
[89:59.31]Well, it is now.
[89:59.93]Fine, let's see what the pose is.
[90:12.32]That takes... Okay, I'm gonna die.
[90:13.82]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[90:25.19]Run.
[90:30.38]Run.
[90:37.77]Run!
[90:42.23]Use spoon to dig up the w- yeah, I gotta dig up the bone.
[90:45.07]But, I'm out of power, I need to plug in.
[90:51.22]Press Z and wait.
[90:52.06]Well, hold on, I'm out of power!
[90:54.78]I'm gonna die if I do that.
[90:59.95]No, don't say Fs.
[91:00.61]No Fs.
[91:01.03]Yes, I am.
[91:06.59]F is canceled.
[91:08.41]Yup.
[91:08.61]Okay, I will hold down Z now.
[91:10.22]We'll see what it does.
[91:11.16]Ready?
[91:28.57]Nothing.
[91:29.51]You just... that's it.
[91:36.93]Imagine having a device that did one small animatronic movement and needed to take $30 of your power bill.
[91:51.40]This is not efficient at all.
[92:01.76]It takes more power to do a single frog hop than it is to clean a whole living room.
[92:15.97]I think there's a bug there.
[92:24.86]Bonus!
[92:34.26]Happy point bonus is... 32.
[92:35.62]Nice.
[93:05.58]132 bucks.
[93:06.30]Gotta keep the house clean, otherwise people lose their minds.
[93:16.84]The right one is my favorite.
[93:17.92]Middle one is my favorite.
[93:22.38]Alright, now we gotta go, uh, bring the other frog back to life.
[93:31.50]We have to speak frog to the frog.
[93:35.64]and bring the frog back here.
[93:39.78]Feed the frog sand instead of water.
[93:41.34]No.
[94:06.02]Alright, we need to go to the upstairs.
[94:24.06]Denny, what are we gonna do?
[94:26.98]Your mom is... Mom is what?
[94:33.68]Thought that was mom again.
[94:36.62]Mom is what?
[94:37.26]Your mom is what?
[94:44.52]I gotta get over there, I gotta go!
[94:55.19]Hurry, save mom.
[94:56.11]I'm going!
[95:02.03]What should we do, Jenny?
[95:05.37]Mama's... Ribbit, ribbit.
[95:10.37]Huh?
[95:13.03]Wait, that's it.
[95:13.62]I can look through these slats.
[95:18.22]That's my smart girl.
[95:21.14]Ribbit.
[95:25.52]It's no use, kiddo.
[95:26.52]My face is too big.
[95:27.52]I can't see inside.
[95:33.11]Give me a hand, Jenny.
[95:37.88]Oh, Chibi-Robo She locked herself in the bedroom I'm a little worried about her, I need to see what's going on in there I can't see through the slats I'm sure she'll be happy to see you, she's not mad at you Can you help me out?

[96:09.26]Let's get the fucking paper.
[96:12.70]And the cheese crumbs.
[96:19.46]And whatever the hell this is.
[96:21.16]Book?
[96:22.18]Oh, well, it's your book.
[96:23.65]Alright, let's go.
[96:27.25]I'm in.
[96:28.21]I'm in.
[96:29.51]Go check on my wife and see what she's up to.
[96:31.67]Say you'll do it.
[96:32.47]I'm begging you.
[96:54.23]Okay, she's sleeping.
[96:55.63]Dead frog!
[96:59.07]Hey, you!
[96:59.67]Get up!

[98:08.20]Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, look at the size of that thing!
[98:16.36]Chibi, what do we do?
[98:20.28]Goodbye.

[98:24.52]You're gonna leave me?
[98:27.74]Is mom awake from this?
[98:40.41]Oh, you're right.
[98:42.33]Oh, my teeth!
[98:45.05]You're made of metal!
[98:55.20]Goodness gracious!
[98:57.80]I can't be running around without my teeth!
[98:59.84]Ain't polite!
[99:01.86]Hold on there, you little varmint!
[99:03.52]I need my teeth!
[99:06.66]He really is the guy from Toy Story.
[99:10.03]Here.
[99:11.27]Dyna Teeth.
[99:13.15]Take it.
[99:13.81]You can have it back.
[99:17.93]Can I a whippersnapper give you my teeth?
[99:24.46]Hummers not to bite me?
[99:35.10]Thanks, Junior.
[99:37.48]This ain't much, but you go on and take it.
[99:41.70]Diana gave me more happy points than everybody in the whole house.
[99:45.85]Sorry, I don't need the money.
[99:47.51]I want the happy points.
[99:50.19]I mistook you for one of them dang frogs.
[99:54.81]What do you expect?
[99:56.69]My eyes are going and you was dressed all in green.
[100:04.68]I guess it was fate that brought us together.
[100:08.16]Stop by if you need anything, you hear?
[100:11.25]Bye now.
[100:19.69]Well, we made a new friend.
[100:20.91]Where's the frog?
[100:27.32]Uh-oh.
[100:31.92]We lost the frog.
[100:35.00]Winning game first.
[100:36.30]Oh, there he is.
[100:55.21]These add up.
[100:57.93]20, 30 happy points every time I do that.
[101:00.07]That adds up.
[101:00.97]I've done that dozens of times.
[101:02.17]It's worth a ton of points.
[101:03.13]What happened?
[101:10.30]I've got to get back to Frieda on the double.
[101:14.70]Will you take me to the backyard?
[101:18.96]Yes.
[101:19.22]Really?
[101:21.38]Truly?
[101:21.88]Really?
[101:26.06]I'm counting on you, Ribbit Ribbit, not yet I have to pick him up
[101:55.99]Counting on you.
[101:56.73]Leaves them for dead.
[101:57.59]I did not... When I find... That motherfucker that's doing that... I'm gonna spray them.
[102:04.91]With water.
[102:06.93]Except it's not gonna be water in that thing.
[102:10.87]I'm gonna go... I'm gonna suck up something from the fucking drain.
[102:14.99]And squeeze it.
[102:16.31]Spray it.
[102:16.75]Alright, let's go.
[102:23.72]Mom?
[102:25.81]Fantastic.
[102:27.29]More receipts.
[102:30.49]So many bills.
[102:37.81]Oh, look at you dressing up like Jenny.
[102:39.56]Why don't you go show her?
[102:40.50]I bet she'd get a kick out of it.
[102:42.86]Very nice.
[102:43.30]You've been cleaning up the house.
[102:45.76]Thank you, Chibo.
[102:54.96]Alright, we're gonna take this off.
[103:05.71]More receipts, more receipts.
[103:07.18]Oh!
[103:07.64]My husband must have sent you in here.
[103:24.19]Oh well, it's not your fault.
[103:27.07]But let me tell you something.
[103:31.74]He's not getting off the hook until he's sorry for what he did.
[103:35.32]Chibo, could you give my husband this letter?
[103:38.98]What's a letter?
[103:40.24]What do you mean, this letter?
[103:40.98]Oh, shit.
[103:43.91]Okay.
[103:45.79]Okay.
[103:52.65]Thank you, Chibo.
[103:54.59]He has to understand.
[103:59.15]Okay, I'll give the letter.
[104:00.09]Alright, frog, let's go.
[104:01.23]Wait, I have to be dressed like a frog.
[104:02.47]Otherwise he won't trust me.
[104:03.37]And I can't talk to him.
[104:07.19]Alright, let's go, frog.
[104:11.11]Take some of this.
[104:22.89]Let's go.
[104:28.51]Okay.
[104:28.99]Are there breathing holes in my body?
[104:47.94]Put him into the trash?
[104:48.98]I can't.
[104:49.96]I don't think that would even work.
[105:03.98]Alright, let me out.
[105:06.48]Alright, Dad.
[105:07.72]I've got a letter for you.
[105:08.78]Feed him to fish.
[105:14.02]Dad?
[105:14.32]Are you still out here?
[105:16.24]Jenny?
[105:16.54]Where's Dad?
[105:16.92]Privet.
[105:35.35]Oh!
[105:37.87]Did the evil frog wizard put a curse on you too, Chibi-Robo?
[105:41.55]Yes.
[105:53.47]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[105:58.31]Just like me.
[106:03.86]Looks very good on you.
[106:05.32]Hehe.
[106:08.34]Holy fuck, that's a lot of points.
[106:11.10]I can only speak to other frogs.
[106:19.26]How do you do, rabbit?
[106:20.62]I mean, rivet.
[106:27.42]Can I talk to the bear?
[106:28.04]Gibby, thanks for checking on mom.
[106:35.41]Looks like dad's asleep.
[106:36.55]He'll be up in the morning.
[106:43.21]Everybody's sleeping out here.
[106:50.10]What?
[106:50.52]Why don't you need to go to sleep?
[106:51.64]There's like three.
[106:54.90]You need more sleep than all of us.
[106:57.40]You need to be in bed.
[107:05.14]Hey, look.
[107:10.98]I can't sleep.
[107:11.82]I wish everything was all better.
[107:13.16]Jesus.
[107:23.39]Mm-hmm.
[107:41.36]This is traumatizing.
[107:44.66]This is pretty fucked up.
[107:46.30]It is.
[107:46.78]Alright.
[107:49.24]Dad's going to get up in the morning, which means I don't think I can do anything.
[107:51.36]Can I wake him up?
[107:58.43]Okay.
[108:00.97]Can I do anything else today?
[108:01.95]I could probably float from... Hold on.
[108:06.55]There's other stuff down here that I can get from up here, isn't there?
[108:12.13]Hey, what are you doing here?
[108:14.21]A frog.
[108:21.20]Yeah, but hold on.
[108:23.12]What are you doing over here?
[108:23.86]Hey.
[108:35.35]Well, alright.
[108:36.37]Let's go bring the frog to the backyard.
[108:46.77]Okay back to the living room which is over here Jenny's too close.
[108:49.40]Oh, okay.
[108:49.66]That makes sense
[109:13.08]Have I been to the basement?
[109:14.00]Yes.
[109:15.18]I have the charger.
[109:15.99]I haven't put any money in it though.
[109:17.71]Apparently got a family I'm trying to work out their problems.
[109:27.17]How is divorce any percent coming along?
[109:32.08]Not sure.
[109:43.65]Couple of these.
[109:44.17]That's worth a lot.
[109:47.99]Ten.
[109:51.23]Very good.
[109:52.11]39 happy points.
[109:54.75]I gotta be in, like, the top five at this point, right?
[109:56.95]Have to be.
[110:00.22]You think I'm gonna be a Chibi-Robo?
[110:01.74]I'm gonna be top five Chibi-Robo in the world and let a piece of trash sit up here?
[110:06.96]You are mistaken.
[110:09.50]Sorry.
[110:25.04]Throw it in.
[110:29.76]You wish you were top five.
[110:30.82]Oh, oh.
[110:31.75]Oh, I am top five.
[110:36.25]When I go back and charge up, you'll see.
[110:37.75]I'm gonna fill this up, though.
[110:46.39]I'm probably gonna need this for something.
[110:51.72]I want a full water syringe.
[110:59.85]Okay.
[111:01.64]Alright, frog.
[111:02.26]It's time to reunite.
[111:03.10]I wonder who the worst Chibi-Robo is.
[111:10.40]I don't know.
[111:13.06]That's a good question.
[111:16.80]Okay, I brought... Here we go.
[111:18.84]Here comes the reuniting of the frogs.
[111:26.49]Hello, Frida.
[111:27.91]I have someone.
[111:32.41]How long is that loser boyfriend of mine gonna keep me waiting?
[111:35.13]Ribbit.
[111:36.47]Honestly.
[111:36.97]Yeah, I found him.
[111:44.43]He was lying down on the ground.
[111:46.43]I think he was shit-faced.
[111:56.14]Frog divorce present.
[111:59.48]Fred, you're still alive!
[112:00.64]You sure got yourself into a mess.
[112:06.10]Figure it out.
[112:07.36]I'm done for, Ribbit.
[112:11.99]I got mistaken.
[112:13.17]The food is chewed to bits.
[112:19.14]What did I tell you?
[112:19.92]That house is dangerous!
[112:21.92]You got hurt because you didn't listen to me, as usual.
[112:26.16]Don't talk so loudly.
[112:29.70]My head still hurts.
[112:33.54]You don't know what pain is, my friend, but you're going to find out pretty soon.
[112:37.78]What?
[112:38.92]Maybe I was better off as a dinosaur snack.
[112:48.07]I'm sorry.
[112:48.79]I'm sorry.
[112:49.61]Sorry if I caused you any trouble.
[112:52.95]See you later.
[112:59.13]Wait, wait, was that meant... Help me!
[113:03.17]Help!
[113:04.29]You just wait for what's in store for you.
[113:05.83]Holy shit!
[113:09.05]Do I go in there?
[113:09.78]How do I do help?
[113:12.56]Hey!
[113:14.16]Oh my god!
[113:15.90]Get out of there!
[113:25.44]Spreading happiness, as usual.
[113:28.28]Can I do anything right?
[113:35.85]Everything I do just... goes horribly wrong.
[113:38.73]Should I d- oh, this thing's a dig up over here.
[113:48.29]What is this?
[113:49.33]Oh.
[113:58.42]Okay.
[114:00.00]What is it?
[114:06.23]More digging?
[114:06.73]Is it a tank?
[114:24.86]Oh, it's the hidden pirate ship.
[114:30.90]Ah!
[114:31.02]Why don't I just unearth?
[114:50.43]Good job, you unearthed ghost pirates.
[115:02.61]Do I hop aboard?
[115:10.39]Ghost problem solved.
[115:18.04]So scary.
[115:20.48]Can I dig in here?
[115:33.64]I just like the song.
[115:34.28]That was cool.
[115:43.30]So I gotta go talk to the pirate again.
[115:44.60]Alright.
[115:47.52]What else?
[115:47.86]I'm gonna run out of time.
[115:56.30]Don't dig too deep.
[115:57.68]Get the bone?
[115:58.24]Dog bone.
[116:00.18]Oh, right.
[116:00.68]There's a bone over here.
[116:12.38]Huh?
[116:16.48]Really?
[116:16.80]I can't take this up?
[116:24.86]Well, I guess I can.
[116:34.29]Is it up enough for me to grab it?
[116:38.98]Dog bone.
[116:43.74]Okay.
[116:44.48]Nice.
[116:46.02]Give dog bone to the dog?
[116:47.06]Do I have a lot of these flowers?
[117:08.15]Oh wait, there's nectar in here!
[117:09.47]Oh!
[117:12.20]Alright, put that away Plant the nectar seed Come on!
[117:31.22]It drained all the nectar
[117:38.15]Alright, I'm gonna be top five.
[117:42.15]At least six.
[117:44.45]I got a lot of points.
[117:47.65]Good morning.
[117:48.70]Let's adjust your point total.
[117:56.04]Oh.
[117:56.74]Well, I made it to nine.
[117:57.76]Top nine.
[118:00.76]Citrusoft has sent you a brand new bonus battery.
[118:05.26]I'll be at 200.
[118:07.18]Yeah!
[118:12.90]Give me 394 more points.
[118:15.60]Alright, I also have to... I got money.
[118:18.33]And I got scrap.
[118:20.57]Get the backup batteries?
[118:28.13]I have one already.
[118:28.75]Alright, let's use some scrap.
[118:38.32]Kitchen bridge.
[118:39.48]Living room bridge.
[118:40.66]A bridge that stretches far.
[118:41.94]Placed on top of the bookcase.
[118:45.16]Or the kitchen one.
[118:46.46]Placed near the planter.
[118:49.36]Which one of these is more useful?
[118:50.36]One in the kitchen.
[119:02.32]Put your scrap into the recyclotron.
[119:05.36]And then I'm going to dump all this money into the batteries.
[119:15.95]Save giga robo.
[119:17.19]Yeah, I'm gonna put the money in here.
[119:18.47]I'm gonna do 2,000 gigawatts.
[119:21.54]Do you want to charge it?
[119:26.52]Yes.
[119:26.62]2,000.
[119:26.70]2,000 kilowatts.
[119:27.02]Kill it!
[119:48.25]Ooh, that was not very much at all.
[119:51.95]Did I break it?
[119:53.67]Something seems a little off, but... Oh well, never mind.
[119:58.05]Yeah.
[119:58.49]Okay.
[119:58.93]Well, I'm gonna go pee.
[120:13.16]I'll be right back.
[120:15.24]See you guys in like, two minutes.
[124:03.07]Imagine if I just pressed the unmute button and fucking screamed as loud as I could.
[124:10.86]Peak fight.
[124:15.92]Okay.
[124:16.76]It's a new day.
[124:17.40]Time to give Dad the letter.
[124:18.72]How dare you.
[124:22.64]No, no, no, no.
[124:23.68]That's not cool.
[124:24.94]That would be so bad.
[124:25.82]Alright, Dad, I got a letter for you.
[124:28.17]Where's Dad?
[124:31.17]Where's Dad?
[124:33.87]Dad not on couch.
[124:38.00]Dad not watching TV on couch.
[124:40.28]Weird.
[124:40.54]Is he still upstairs?
[124:43.26]I mean, it's a cleaning game first.
[124:51.31]Okay.
[125:27.64]I put on my wizard robe for this.
[125:31.32]It's a cleaning game first.
[125:32.45]It's a cleaning game first, divorce game second.
[125:53.28]God.
[125:53.46]What the fuck?
[125:56.99]Alright, that's... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[126:05.41]Four for footprints.
[126:07.61]These add up.
[126:08.71]They add up.
[126:11.17]Guys, doing side quests gives me sometimes like 12.
[126:13.37]This adds up like crazy.
[126:24.28]Alright, charge up.
[126:25.06]And I'm gonna go talk to Dad.
[126:39.66]Remember, you would do that even if it gave 1.
[126:40.92]Yeah, I would.
[126:43.42]Yes, I would.
[126:45.00]Because that's 7 to 10 points per clean-up.
[126:51.11]Do that 10 times.
[126:53.11]You've just made almost an entire battery worth.
[126:56.28]30% almost.
[126:59.36]What about the pirate friend?
[127:00.98]Yeah, but I mean, priority right now is give the letter to dad.
[127:06.86]We're doing main storyline quests here.
[127:16.06]That's one of my favorite noises.
[127:22.76]He's being frugal.
[127:25.92]It's, yeah, this, come on, this is how I get my points, I level up!
[127:29.54]2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, like, I just did a whole side mission.
[127:36.50]I'm picking up dog hair.
[127:37.54]You have to read the letter first.
[127:43.67]Why?
[127:43.95]This letter contains some bad news.
[127:53.29]Are these papers?
[127:55.09]Are these like divorce papers?
[127:56.65]No, they're not.
[127:57.97]Is this game going to go full dark?
[128:11.26]How'd it go?
[128:21.93]What'd she say?
[128:26.23]I mean, there's the chaos route release the scurvy splinter and everyone has to like everyone get out and then Hey, is that what I think it is it is isn't it a love letter?
[128:51.47]Oh man, this dude's truly clueless.
[129:07.62]Ahem!
[129:09.48]I think I'll read this love letter out loud!
[129:11.52]And then the little girl.
[129:23.74]Jenny thinks she's a frog, and the man of the house isn't man enough to find another job.
[129:36.96]Well, I've had enough.
[129:40.32]I'm sorry, but you've pushed me to the edge.
[129:46.98]The only option I've got left is divorce.
[129:54.76]Divorce.
[129:57.50]Ribbit.
[130:00.38]No!
[130:09.72]I got no time to lose.
[130:11.98]I gotta cook, clean the house, and fix stuff.
[130:14.12]I have to win her back.
[130:16.48]Let's go, Jenny.
[130:17.20]Come on, Tao.
[130:17.84]Hurry.
[130:18.84]Down the stairs.
[130:19.60]She's huge!
[130:24.42]She's huge!
[130:32.20]Arf!
[130:35.59]Oh my god, she's huge!
[130:38.39]She grew, she's as big as dad!
[130:40.81]What?
[130:51.90]Okay, um...
[130:55.12]Congratulations.
[130:59.58]She's like 26.
[131:00.65]What?
[131:07.03]No.
[131:09.65]I've never seen him in the same room before.
[131:11.30]That's the first I've ever seen him in the same room.
[131:22.95]No, but wasn't she kneeling on the ground?
[131:27.35]Wait, what?
[131:28.05]How have I not figured this out?
[131:33.06]She's like six feet tall.
[131:37.58]She's not like two years old.
[131:47.64]Jenny's in her thirties.
[131:58.12]Alright, let's go.
[131:59.92]Let's go down and see what they're doing.
[132:04.04]To the kitchen.
[132:23.40]Wait.
[132:26.00]Yes, to the kitchen.
[132:27.12]Yes.
[132:28.57]Yes.
[132:30.03]Yes.
[132:30.27]I just got a bridge for the kitchen, right?
[132:33.27]Yes.
[132:33.49]To the basement.
[132:34.83]Hold on.
[132:50.91]Go see mom.
[132:52.33]I know one thing at a time.
[132:53.31]I want to see what they're doing.
[132:54.07]I got a bridge.
[132:54.57]I got a bridge in the kitchen.
[132:56.39]I got to bring back the guy's pirate ship.
[133:06.84]Alright.
[133:07.40]Okay.
[133:07.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:08.16]Okay.
[133:08.50]Let me do it.
[133:08.76]I'm going to talk to mom first.
[133:10.67]I mean, I'm right here.
[133:11.83]Might as well.
[133:21.85]Climb.
[133:53.90]Hello?
[133:54.98]Wait.
[133:55.22]I don't know why I just thought I could just open the door.
[133:59.10]I'm an idiot.
[133:59.98]Alright, let's go.
[134:10.30]How much power does a teleporter cost?
[134:12.33]A lot.
[134:21.19]I can't believe I got timed out for typing this TP noise.
[134:33.46]Why is it not like this?
[134:47.54]Well, how many times did you write it?
[134:59.99]Not enough.
[135:02.37]Jesus.
[135:12.77]Dog tracks mud in house as mom tracks huge prints behind a locked door.
[135:19.22]You know what?
[135:20.46]Yeah.
[135:22.20]How did these get here?
[135:23.46]That's bullshit.
[135:28.60]Hmm.
[135:35.43]Yes, this happens seven times.
[135:38.53]I still don't know who's throwing... What was that?
[135:46.43]I don't know why they're doing it.
[135:47.35]Okay, Mom, let's talk.
[135:54.43]See, it delivered my letter.
[135:59.91]Oh, look at you.
[136:01.01]I'm dressed like this.
[136:02.53]I'm going to... Okay.
[136:09.88]I've been picking up garbage around the house.
[136:17.58]Ten happy points.
[136:18.20]That's as much as... I get more cleaning up three footprints.
[136:21.50]Just saying.
[136:25.67]That's a bonus for cleaning up those footprints.
[136:38.95]Yes, I delivered the letter.
[136:39.87]I think you deserve a reward for being just the smartest little robot ever.
[136:45.47]Holy shit, that is a big one.
[136:48.92]120 points.
[136:55.08]I never thought boycotting all my housework would be this boring.
[136:59.46]I wish there was something I could do.
[137:03.85]Wait, I know!
[137:05.58]I haven't sewn for ages.
[137:06.52]I think I'll get out of the old sewing kit for a change.
[137:09.72]Since you've been working so hard and have been such a good bot, I'll make something nice and cozy just for you.
[137:15.04]Ooh.
[137:16.48]Give me a little time, okay?
[137:17.31]Alright.
[137:26.17]Mom, what's the code for the briefcase?
[137:40.82]Six, six, six.
[137:47.90]Just a minute, Chibo!
[137:50.90]Being so tiny must make things awfully hard for you.
[137:52.89]Let me give you a hand.
[137:55.33]There you go.
[137:57.89]I know you're small, but you do your best.
[138:00.43]Oh, thanks.
[138:00.85]You just saved me some time.
[138:06.51]Very nice of you, Mom.
[138:17.49]Alright, now we're gonna go down to the basement, and then back... No, we're not.
[138:28.95]Get off me!
[138:29.25]Alright, do we have enough?
[138:37.83]Not enough.
[138:51.71]We're good.
[138:53.87]Alright, back downstairs.
[138:55.03]Wait.
[138:55.53]I see a stain that I haven't gotten.
[138:59.08]Two of them, actually.
[138:59.76]Okay.
[139:08.37]Wait.
[139:08.55]A little bit more over here.
[139:09.71]Yep.
[139:11.39]I think that's just artifacting.
[139:13.59]No, these are scuff marks.
[139:15.45]Probably from Dad.
[139:17.17]Scuff marks that were worth four points.
[139:24.19]Scuff marks on a carpet.
[139:25.34]Scuffed stream.
[139:25.90]It's from the car peeling out.
[139:26.92]Got a cleaning bonus.
[139:27.76]I think I'm pretty close to another rank up, right?
[139:56.72]Ugh, look at all this dirt.
[140:04.59]I just can't have this.
[140:05.93]Okay.
[140:06.37]Ah, there's more.
[140:07.69]Uh, wait, hold on.
[140:29.63]It's your mom.
[140:32.59]I can't clean on... I can't clean on surfaces that... Why can I not clean these?
[140:37.15]I can't scrub on surfaces in front of me.
[140:40.27]Only on the ground.
[140:43.21]I missed one?
[140:43.67]No, I didn't.
[140:46.52]I know.
[140:46.78]I'm going over here.
[140:49.22]Water?
[140:50.16]Oh.
[140:51.10]Well, I don't have water.
[140:52.12]I have nectar.
[141:00.59]I have enough power to do this?
[141:03.21]Yeah.
[141:38.12]He had to charge his eyelids.
[141:39.32]Oh god.
[142:02.67]How much power does it take to wink?
[142:04.99]Oh, let's see.
[142:06.49]How many... Okay, so you get 2,000 calories in a day.
[142:10.21]Just sitting here breathing is about... Let's see.
[142:13.93]Oh, let's pause for a second.
[142:15.01]Oh, I'm actually curious about this.
[142:16.21]So how... How many calories do you burn blinking?
[142:27.16]Do you burn calories when you blink?
[142:31.55]Okay.
[142:31.67]Okay.
[142:37.12]Do you lose weight when you blink?
[142:41.67]What?
[142:41.91]How many calories do you burn when you fart?
[142:49.43]A popular internet claim from 2015 said that one fart burned 67 calories And that farting 52 times a day would burn a pound of fat What a bunch of bullshit
[143:11.83]Okay, so if you blink... Alright, so by doing nothing... So it's probably like two tenths of a Calibri to blink.
[143:31.86]So, two tenths of one Calibri kilowatt.
[143:46.71]Don't get banned by doing that noise.
[143:48.13]60 calories!
[143:57.74]So you're telling me that if you go on like... I don't know, this is gonna be gross, but we're talking, this is real life.
[144:04.16]If you go on like a farting spree over the course of like an hour... It's gonna burn like a thousand calories?
[144:12.99]Who the fuck wrote that?
[144:17.46]I want to go in the kitchen.
[144:18.22]I want to see the bridge.
[144:19.39]I want to see what they're doing.
[144:20.47]Uh-oh.
[144:22.08]Small kind of spiders.
[144:46.31]He starved to death because he farted too many times in a row.
[144:49.47]That's so disgusting.
[145:03.60]God, gross.
[145:06.58]Just, just gross.
[145:08.08]What's with all the... Come on, I don't want to like... I don't want any more random like Pokémon battles.
[145:17.98]I got cleaning to do.
[145:19.00]Where's the family?
[145:21.48]Why is nobody to be found?
[145:24.78]Holy shit, look at all this dirt.
[146:03.40]I imagine somebody opening the chat because they like Chibi-Robo for the first time they're here and they look at this fucking chat room and they see fart redeemed actual fart fart redeemed fart redeemed and it would just be like like you just you just pop the chat out and minimize it at that point I think
[146:21.88]So you don't have it, we just close the tab.
[146:25.26]Be a good bonus.
[146:29.70]Did I buy the car?
[146:30.26]Yeah, and I haven't been able to use it.
[146:49.21]I own the car and I can't even use it.
[146:50.89]I don't know what to do with it.
[146:52.23]Take the ghost costume off.
[146:57.35]Take the go- Got you.
[147:00.18]Sorry, I had to do that one more time before I, you know, took it off.
[147:09.16]So much to do.
[147:09.82]Look at this.
[147:10.20]So much dirt on the ground.
[147:16.40]Wait, there's another training regimen with the eggs, right?
[147:18.44]Yeah.
[147:18.80]I go back there after I do the, uh, boat.
[147:21.90]39 more points.
[147:22.26]I'm raking it in.
[147:22.76]Alright, let's go to the ship.
[147:24.08]How many side quests?
[147:53.50]Where's the bridge?
[148:24.55]Yeah, I don't have enough time.
[148:25.65]I have enough time to do the bridge.
[148:26.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[148:27.76]Alright, alright, alright.
[148:30.58]Look at all this dirt.
[148:31.22]No, fuck the dirt.
[148:33.18]Forget it.
[148:34.36]It's so easy.
[148:35.62]No, it's not.
[148:36.00]I want to do the bridge.
[148:50.51]Think about how much dirt... I haven't done it in so long.
[148:52.23]Think about how much junk is up in the, uh... in the fan... Let me check the bridge out.
[149:00.82]Because I've invested a lot of money into making the kitchen traversable.
[149:08.90]Where's the bridge?
[149:10.61]Right there?
[149:11.09]Okay.
[149:11.69]I'm gonna run out of time, but I still want to see it.
[149:14.77]What about the flowers?
[149:15.41]I haven't checked on those either.
[149:23.10]Oh, look, they're little sprouts.
[149:28.47]It's a bud, Chibi-Robo.
[149:29.67]Wow.
[149:30.89]Alright, turn it on.
[149:37.31]Do you want to know how to use the bridge utility bomb?
[149:40.46]Sure.
[149:42.58]Insert your plug to unfold the bridge.
[149:45.72]If you want to shorten it, just tilt down.
[149:48.74]Change the bridge's direction, plug in the side... Push or pull the utility bot freely, so try moving the utility bot to a different location.
[149:58.81]Alright, where do I want to go from here?
[150:02.54]Ah, that way.
[150:03.18]Ooh!
[150:05.10]Ooh!
[150:07.46]Oh my goodness!
[150:12.14]What have you done?
[150:14.06]It really is.
[150:43.26]Or it's... I thought the bridge was complete, and it wasn't.
[150:58.97]This is a stranding type game.
[151:04.05]Death Stranding.
[151:04.65]This is a stranding... Alright, this is happening way more frequently. ...
[151:13.86]It's happened nine times in ten hours of gameplay.
[151:20.39]It's happened like four times in the last one hour.
[151:22.95]Why is it happening in more frequency?
[151:35.16]No, whatever.
[151:36.44]I can... I'll come back.
[151:37.84]There's not enough time in the day to do anything.
[151:44.68]I'm definitely up to... I'm definitely like eight or seven.
[151:59.53]The seventh best robo?
[152:07.02]Eight.
[152:08.58]Making it into the top eight!
[152:10.10]More power!
[152:17.72]That's a lot.
[152:18.50]That's a huge increase.
[152:19.71]230.
[152:20.55]That's huge.
[152:30.81]Oh.
[152:33.20]Chibi-Robo is a new product available through the online store.
[152:37.00]Let's see here.
[152:38.06]Ah, there.
[152:38.44]It's some new Chibi gear.
[152:39.54]They call it Chibi Radar.
[152:42.33]With one of those, you'd be able to find things not visible to the naked eye.
[152:46.63]You have to buy it and see if it's true.
[152:48.19]Okay, yeah.
[152:48.81]Let's go.
[152:49.07]Well, it depends on how much it is.
[152:50.39]Okay.
[153:14.31]Okay.
[153:20.14]Seeds.
[153:21.74]GB radar.
[153:22.72]I can't afford it.
[153:25.10]Let you see things that are hidden from normal view.
[153:27.28]Okay, I'll buy that next.
[153:30.54]I have enough to do this.
[153:31.26]Living room bridge.
[153:32.06]Yeah, I can do this.
[153:34.34]Let's do it.
[153:35.28]Okay.
[153:43.86]Does Jerma ever scream?
[153:47.36]Yeah, sometimes.
[153:49.69]Sometimes.
[153:52.89]Maybe like once.
[153:55.51]It's a utility bot.
[153:59.19]Where's this going?
[153:59.71]On the bookcase?
[154:00.31]I'll set it out in the living room.
[154:05.00]Alright.
[154:07.22]Let's go.
[154:14.93]I want to go to the basement too.
[154:16.89]But we just, ugh.
[154:18.25]Okay, where is it?
[154:19.05]Because there's other stuff in here that I didn't get.
[154:28.35]Frog ring up there.
[154:31.92]Where is it?
[154:32.30]I gotta get higher.
[154:50.65]Where's this bridge?
[154:54.95]Top of the TV, you know?
[154:58.99]Oh, it's over there!
[155:00.14]But I can't... Can I get up there yet?
[155:05.48]I think I can, right?
[155:06.88]Hold on.
[155:10.12]Let me push this back.
[155:25.65]Aw, a jupe classic.
[155:27.13]Nice.
[155:28.33]Alright, can this go any higher?
[155:46.03]No, it can't.
[155:48.21]It's pronounced jupe.
[155:51.00]Can you imagine?
[155:54.46]Going into a stream and correcting somebody on their own thing that they created.
[155:58.94]Can you imagine a scenario where you do that?
[156:08.44]What's the scenario where you do that?
[156:15.84]When you look through a telescope and you see the beautiful, big, beautiful, huge planet known as Jupiter.
[156:22.86]Yeah.
[156:24.94]Jupiter.
[156:25.40]It's the biggest planet we have in our solar system.
[156:31.30]It's huge.
[156:33.78]Alright.
[156:34.58]Oh.
[156:34.66]Ooh!
[156:34.76]I can get this.
[156:42.58]No, stop picking up the cord.
[156:43.84]I wish there was a way I could make it so I don't pick the cord up.
[156:51.80]Let's get that frog ring.
[156:56.92]More.
[157:00.44]More.
[157:02.38]More.
[157:03.60]Okay.
[157:07.12]I was wondering how to get this for the longest time, and now we got it.
[157:14.01]Wait.
[157:22.43]Oh.
[157:26.17]Well.
[157:27.97]Now I know how to get over there.
[157:43.36]Slow, slow, slow.
[157:44.42]Alright, now we go, we just drop down to here.
[157:46.36]Nice.
[157:48.38]Demon door.
[158:02.03]Okay.
[158:02.81]And I can climb on that too?
[158:04.07]Let's do this first.
[158:16.66]Good chunk of change.
[158:17.34]Does it confirm you to the ceiling?
[158:23.76]Oh man, we're up pretty high.
[158:28.88]Alright, hold on.
[158:32.04]This is... I'm all the way to the top.
[158:35.68]Okay, what's up here?
[158:36.66]I could go this way.
[158:40.90]And go over there.
[158:42.54]Or... What do I want to do up here?
[158:50.57]Is there anything that's super high up that I haven't gotten?
[158:52.61]I guess over there...
[159:02.80]In here.
[159:05.68]Alright, let's just walk around.
[159:09.39]I don't fall, right?
[159:10.23]Okay, as long as I'm careful.
[159:15.63]Can I go in here?
[159:17.65]Fall and float into this?
[159:18.64]But is there anything even over there?
[159:19.94]There's nothing even there.
[159:20.84]I don't think there's any reason to do that.
[159:35.69]Alright, there's a space over this way.
[159:39.55]What is this?
[159:40.13]This is a weird spot.
[159:44.45]Ooh!
[159:47.58]Right there.
[159:47.92]Okay, I can fall from there and float into the demon door.
[159:55.28]I could also... Yeah, that's... and then I got everything.
[159:58.92]I've not missed one thing in this room at that point.
[160:04.22]Alright, let's keep walking.
[160:05.36]No, I don't want to take the chopper out.
[160:07.24]There's a demon door under me.
[160:12.48]Oh, wait.
[160:12.80]There is one right there.
[160:14.23]Did I get this one?
[160:22.23]I got this one already!
[160:23.17]Wow, I knew I got this one already.
[160:25.53]I knew I got this one already.
[160:27.02]Oh, I got it already.
[160:27.76]I knew it.
[160:28.32]I was like, I got it.
[160:29.58]Oh, baited.
[160:30.76]It's alright.
[160:32.70]I can get right back up there.
[160:51.17]Alright, charge up.
[160:51.83]No save.
[160:54.87]What happens at 100 charges?
[161:20.66]The battery explodes.
[161:27.20]Alright, same deal.
[161:42.98]Climb.
[161:43.36]And then run along the wall and get the secret demon door.
[162:03.51]Float?
[162:04.51]Alright.
[162:08.03]Wait.
[162:10.15]Maybe something behind the picture of, uh... No?
[162:17.63]I don't know, maybe there's something behind there.
[162:29.92]What's the fastest way?
[162:32.30]Get to... I think they're both equally slow.
[162:36.72]We gotta get over there.
[162:38.20]We're just gonna have to run this way.
[162:39.40]Alright, let's go.
[162:47.61]All the way.
[162:48.93]Along the whole wall.
[162:49.83]Just run.
[162:51.75]Yep.
[163:16.06]Where is it?
[163:16.36]Over there.
[163:19.62]No, where is it?
[163:20.38]It's like right here, right?
[163:30.89]Why?
[163:31.53]Okay.
[163:33.47]Isn't it right here?
[163:36.74]It's right here, isn't it?
[163:47.38]Where is this thing?
[163:47.98]Did I pass it?
[163:55.86]No, it's right there.
[163:56.38]It's right there.
[163:56.78]Okay.
[164:07.03]I just got to get on top of this.
[164:09.85]And then float into here.
[164:20.67]Bingo.
[164:20.97]Aha!
[164:26.95]This is the last door that's in here.
[164:28.63]I think, right?
[164:30.67]I can check the, uh... Let me see.
[164:37.64]Eight out of nine.
[164:39.48]Who is the ninth one?
[164:43.16]Fuck, there's one more.
[164:46.36]Eight out of nine?
[164:47.22]It's probably hidden somewhere.
[164:49.81]It's probably hidden.
[164:50.83]Yeah, I probably need that device.
[164:51.91]Alright, let's go.
[164:54.83]Alright, what's next on the list?
[165:01.38]We're going to... the basement.
[165:06.54]So... basement is into the foyer and then basement.
[165:12.69]Actually, I want to do the... Yeah, let's go this way.
[165:14.73]I want to do this first.
[165:18.58]Sherman, did you read this important message?
[165:20.22]I did.
[165:20.44]It was very important.
[165:22.23]I'm so glad that you brought it to my attention.
[165:24.07]Alright, let's go talk to the beans.
[165:32.99]Or the eggs, whatever they are.
[165:33.85]Hi.
[165:49.97]Private Vegas reporting for duty.
[165:51.11]Uh-huh.
[165:52.39]Sarge has been a tough egg to crack lately.
[165:56.86]All I want to do is race cars.
[165:59.60]Maybe I'll drive away and go AWOL.
[166:02.72]Tag me when Jerma lies.
[166:03.80]What the fuck is going on here?
[166:06.74]What did I lie about?
[166:11.58]What are you doing?
[166:14.05]What was my lie?
[166:14.77]I didn't lie.
[166:15.55]Tell me the lie.
[166:17.61]What was the lie?
[166:25.60]Let me know when you want this to stop.
[166:29.36]Yeah, there was nothing there.
[166:32.36]He didn't like the message.
[166:33.92]A lot about Rain World.
[166:40.72]Alright.
[166:42.32]Enough with the Rain World.
[166:45.64]Can we move on from Rain World?
[166:52.09]It's a fun game.
[166:56.91]Alright, where's the captain?
[167:02.11]I want to do this mission, whatever it is.
[167:11.37]Come back to it in like a month or two.
[167:13.85]Alright, here come the timeouts.
[167:21.79]I cannot guarantee you will not be timed out if you continue to spam that.
[167:29.62]Uh-oh.
[167:30.74]Manka W. What is Manka W?
[167:32.44]Alright, basement.
[167:36.60]Basement.
[167:38.24]Let's go get this guy's ship back.
[167:48.77]Enable it and find out.
[167:50.07]Nah, I don't need to.
[167:51.07]What happened to the music?
[168:04.62]Please do.
[168:05.00]It's better.
[168:05.38]Isn't it just... Okay, it's Jerm of Fear and Jerm of Mars, right?
[168:08.52]That's what it is?
[168:13.78]Hold on, we just had a shitload of subs come in.
[168:27.72]That's a lot of subs.
[168:33.06]JermaSucks gave 50 community subs.
[168:37.30]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[168:40.42]That's a heavy, heavy full bag of community subscriptions.
[168:46.55]You just dumped it in front of everybody.
[168:48.83]Thanks a lot.
[168:51.11]That's a lot of money.
[168:53.93]That's a cat puke noise, especially for you.
[168:59.27]Thanks for the monumental amount of subscriptions.
[169:06.43]There's a new GeForce driver for your information.
[169:11.03]Alright.
[169:13.47]Wait, why do I have to... This is going... Is it for the GameCube?
[169:26.20]Shit, I gotta update my GeForce GameCube driver.
[169:28.98]Okay, what was actually in the Wii?
[169:30.82]It was ATI, wasn't it?
[169:32.62]Yeah.
[169:33.78]The Wii was ATI.
[169:47.05]So is GameCube, yeah.
[169:52.67]What does everybody have now?
[169:54.55]Like, for instance, what is in the Switch?
[169:55.77]Is it an ATI still?
[170:00.29]Is it Nvidia?
[170:01.09]What's in the Switch?
[170:02.68]What's in the Xbox One?
[170:06.18]What's in the PS4?
[170:07.22]Is it all Nvidia?
[170:08.86]Does anybody have ATI anymore?
[170:12.56]Alright, okay, let's talk to this guy and give him his, uh... Hold on.
[170:15.74]A little more oil.
[170:17.52]Xbox is AMD.
[170:25.23]PS4 and Xbox are AMD, I'm pretty sure.
[170:27.99]Hmm.
[170:31.39]Sir, you've come to hear this old salt tale, have you?
[170:44.25]No, but I'm sure.
[170:48.03]Alright, sit ye back and get ready for a whale of a tale.
[170:51.79]Hold on.
[170:57.26]I'm here to keep my promise too.
[170:58.80]Ahoy there, squid bait.
[171:01.68]You're looking ship-shaped today.
[171:04.58]Squid bait?
[171:05.24]Squid bait!
[171:07.20]Aye, squid bait.
[171:08.34]Now shipper down.
[171:10.50]What I'm about to tell you happened many years ago when Twirled was young.
[171:15.62]Get a loading screen for this.
[171:35.74]A big coin.
[171:38.73]That fateful day I found a doubloon gleaming like a wee lassie's eyes, and the salty scourge of the seas that I was.
[171:48.34]I decided to seize this shiny treasure for myself.
[171:55.82]Oh, what a pretty treasure it was.
[171:58.58]However, the Sandersons were so poor, you could hear their bellies rumbling like thunder.
[172:10.51]Giga-Robo blamed himself for their troubles.
[172:13.65]Aye, he did.
[172:17.91]Every pirate swears to be as evil as a barnacle in bed.
[172:22.25]It be our code.
[172:26.24]But I couldn't even steal one measly doubloon.
[172:30.12]Car of foul humiliation it was.
[172:33.58]As ye know, pirates who aren't evil end up at theme parks.
[172:38.26]It be terrifying.
[172:39.50]That's pretty funny.
[172:42.19]I hid me ship and confined meself in the branny, dark basement.
[172:50.56]Sure, the sanders be out of moolah and can't be buyin' food.
[172:54.46]I'm bettin' they be... dead.
[172:55.36]Wait, like now?
[172:58.58]They're dead?
[172:59.10]Huh?
[173:11.47]Actually, the Sanderson family is doing just fine.
[173:13.59]They may not be rich, but they were at least able to buy us.
[173:18.03]And we're not exactly bargain basement items, if I do say so myself.
[173:26.68]Ah, what's that you be saying?
[173:28.08]So, they'd not have been troubled if I'd claimed the moolah I found a spion?
[173:39.48]I heard that Mr. Sanderson hasn't been working, and finances are kind of tight.
[173:44.06]But if it's just a little, it's not a problem.
[173:50.00]You know what this means.
[173:51.99]I'm no longer bound to this dank backwater.
[173:56.45]There's treasure in this house, that is, and I means to find it.
[174:02.54]Hoist the main sail, me hearties!
[174:10.13]Oh, right, I have it.
[174:14.03]I have to give it to you.
[174:17.19]Don't you need a ship first?
[174:22.21]Shiver me timbers.
[174:23.05]I forgot I've got no ship.
[174:28.21]This is the quest we just got put on, and I have it already.
[174:32.13]I put me ship in a dry dock so as to keep her safe, but me head's full of fog and me ship's lost.
[174:41.42]You're my only hope, Chibi.
[174:42.68]I want you to find me ship and bring her home.
[174:46.71]I've got a surprise for you.
[174:49.29]Stop ad-libbing.
[174:50.93]What?
[174:54.93]I'm going off... Who cares?
[174:56.91]What?
[174:57.29]I'm going off script for a few words.
[175:00.61]Like any real actor does.
[175:01.89]You know how many lines you've heard in movies that were not scripted?
[175:08.11]Turned out to be the most classic things you've heard on screen?
[175:12.98]A pirate in need is a pirate who gets what he wants.
[175:17.92]That's the pirate's code, you see.
[175:20.77]Doesn't seem right somehow.
[175:23.37]Hmm.
[175:23.97]Don't think so, eh?
[175:26.15]You fancy yourself a great thinker, don't you, you flying bucket of bits?
[175:36.28]If you're half as keen as you think, you'll keep your blowhole shut.
[175:40.69]Pirates are not accustomed to waiting.
[175:42.67]Now go find me ship.
[175:47.57]Yes.
[175:48.03]Yes, sir.
[175:48.99]Captain.
[175:49.51]Captain, sir.
[175:55.76]Let's go look for the shipkeeper.
[175:57.18]I'll go ahead and scout around.
[175:58.24]Good.
[175:59.04]Now that he's gone.
[176:00.72]Can we just talk about how I wish... I just don't want him fucking following me around anymore.
[176:04.64]I have your ship.
[176:05.90]But I don't want to tell him.
[176:06.97]I'm just going to let him go do that for a while.
[176:08.47]You want to let go hang out?
[176:14.60]I have.
[176:14.78]The Scurvy Splinter.
[176:15.26]It's so big.
[176:15.70]Yeah, it is.
[176:46.69]Aha!
[176:47.55]So I'm assuming we can fly around in this thing?
[176:54.65]Yes, it be mine, ye floatin' kelp cube.
[176:57.87]That's me scurvy splinter.
[177:01.43]Me ship you've earned me, thanks.
[177:03.11]Gonna be a lot of happy points.
[177:06.51]Captain Plankbeard just gave you 66 happy points.
[177:13.83]Spread the happiness.
[177:17.02]There's treasure awaitin' and methinks I'll be gettin' me some.
[177:24.29]Alright, so have we completed his questline?
[177:27.11]Hmm.
[177:29.67]It says there's treasure awaitin'.
[177:32.85]Anchors away, me hearties.
[177:34.37]Probably needs power.
[177:41.37]We have to have a new battery charge for... Grandpa's fuckin' rowboat.
[177:50.22]Carnicles and bilge pumps.
[177:51.62]I've got no blasted crew Hi, then there's only one thing to do I Need you to find me some brave lads who yearn for a life of swashbuckling adventure If you find me four men brave and true I'll
[178:21.98]I'll have no choice but to give you me treasure map.
[178:26.12]Got it.
[178:26.62]One pirate crew coming up.
[178:28.16]Okay, the eggs would probably do it, right?
[178:31.99]Need four crewmen.
[178:34.55]Courage me, lads.
[178:35.27]Courage.
[178:35.55]Probably the dinosaur?
[178:37.41]One of the eggs?
[178:37.89]The dinosaur?
[178:41.23]What about you?
[178:41.62]Hmm, let's plug in.
[178:53.41]It's probably, yeah, it's definitely the eggs.
[178:54.53]I am.
[178:56.57]Here we go.
[178:59.81]Okay.
[178:59.99]So, the next order of business.
[179:01.67]It's going to be a new day.
[179:24.83]We gotta go check out- where's the family?
[179:27.75]We gotta go check up on what the family's doing.
[179:34.78]Dally the princess.
[179:35.80]We gotta go climb the- the tower.
[179:37.82]Right, right, right.
[179:39.98]Yeah, that's true.
[179:41.68]Alright, we have the tower with the shoe.
[179:44.40]We have the family doing whatever the hell the family's doing.
[179:47.62]Wherever they are.
[179:48.16]Yeah, we're doing chores.
[179:51.68]But I haven't seen them in any of the rooms.
[179:56.10]Let's go climb the tower.
[179:57.00]We'll do that tomorrow.
[179:57.64]Maybe I can recruit somebody up here.
[180:01.77]What does it mean if your computer says... It means I would turn it off.
[180:14.21]And check to see if potentially one of the fans is spinning and hitting something in your case.
[180:19.35]That's a very easy fix.
[180:21.54]I would check that first.
[180:23.36]Uh, if not, then I would be careful with a potential messed up power supply.
[180:28.44]Um... I wish you got to be careful with that though, electricity.
[180:31.18]Don't fuck with electricity.
[180:33.96]I checked... You want to begin jungle training?
[180:38.04]Um, do I have enough time for this?
[180:41.17]No.
[180:44.10]Could be an SSD dying.
[180:45.40]Yep.
[180:45.56]There's a quiet time with television.
[180:54.63]What do you do if your computer is just a pile of rocks?
[181:06.60]Um, somebody has convinced you that your computer is a pile of rocks, but behind the big rock, there's a small, probably form factor PC that's behind it, plugged into the wall, and then plugged into a monitor.
[181:17.78]So, somebody's been lying to you for a long time.
[181:20.07]I don't know what your situation is, wherever you are.
[181:22.27]Still rank 8. ...
[181:33.87]Check the seasoning.
[181:34.67]The garlic salt may have dried up.
[181:39.55]Maybe the rock is the case.
[181:41.95]Now that's actually kind of cool.
[181:45.14]Carve out of this in the middle of a rock and have your components in there?
[181:48.72]I think that would be pretty bad for heat conduction.
[181:56.12]A flintstone case.
[181:59.91]How is that cool?
[182:01.52]I don't know, people dunk their motherboards in... oil.
[182:05.90]In like a fish tank.
[182:07.56]Without any fish in it.
[182:10.06]People do all kinds of weird shit with their computer setups.
[182:16.94]I think I'm gonna buy... Wait.
[182:18.73]Do I have enough?
[182:24.96]I do.
[182:25.80]Bedroom bridge, bedroom, basement warp.
[182:29.39]Warps you from place to place.
[182:32.43]Basement warp, bedroom bridge.
[182:34.49]A bridge that stretches far, placed on the ceiling beam.
[182:36.63]Yup.
[182:41.11]Yeah, let's see.
[182:48.76]I'm gonna get the radar too.
[182:59.44]Okay, do I have enough of the radar?
[183:05.10]What was it, 1700?
[183:11.66]Chibi radar lets you see things that are hidden from normal view.
[183:15.00]Buy it.
[183:19.57]Upgrade.
[183:32.87]Keep it up, Chibi-Robo.
[183:39.24]Let's go.
[183:39.74]Let's test it.
[183:49.94]See how it works.
[183:52.03]Chibi Radar.
[183:56.71]Um, how does it work?
[184:03.85]So it points in the direction of something hidden.
[184:09.27]It uses power.
[184:09.97]Is there something hidden back here?
[184:12.07]Ooh!
[184:12.15]Dig?
[184:13.81]Alright, I'm gonna dig.
[184:18.60]Dig right here?
[184:25.08]What the fuck?
[184:30.65]Sound, sound, sound.
[184:33.33]Sound makes me grow.
[184:36.57]Let me hear sound.
[184:39.65]Spoon, give me spoon.
[185:01.69]This just reminds me of one of those old, weird GIFs from like 2001.
[185:04.83]How much more do I have to do this?
[185:08.29]How big do I need to make him?
[185:11.37]He's huge!
[185:31.76]full oh I am full thank you thank you for sound oh fuck Mr. prongs gave you 99 happy points wow this guy had a plug for a head you saw that too right no I just played music for him for 30 minutes
[185:58.10]It needs a name.
[185:58.68]Maybe we can call it Mr. Prongs.
[186:01.30]I'm totally creeped out right now.
[186:04.29]Oh, you got the Mr. Prongs sticker!
[186:07.29]You really are amazing, Chibi-Robo.
[186:10.09]Sticker.
[186:24.14]Sticker.
[186:29.53]I'm gonna get so trapped.
[186:31.06]I'm gonna get so trapped.
[186:33.44]I'm gonna just follow around the radar.
[186:36.76]No, we got... Alright, we'll do that later.
[186:48.49]Let me plug in.
[186:49.55]I wasted a lot of power.
[186:52.69]Checking on Frog Girl.
[186:53.53]Oh, I actually have rings for Frog Girl.
[186:55.43]Thanks for the reminder.
[187:04.79]We're getting some mild Fs.
[187:05.91]Oh, we are dropping frames, huh?
[187:12.64]Oh, actually, we're getting massive Fs.
[187:15.84]This is no longer mild.
[187:18.98]This is now an issue.
[187:22.16]This is an Omega F. Uh-oh.
[187:38.50]It's because I'm playing Halo.
[187:40.18]Hey, get off Halo!
[187:42.18]Stop playing Halo!
[187:43.74]Let's wait this out for a little bit.
[187:52.65]I'm gonna sit in the corner.
[187:53.87]I'm gonna pause this so there's no movement on the screen.
[187:57.11]Here, ready?
[187:57.91]This is how you work with this scenario.
[188:01.53]So a black screen requires no rendering.
[188:10.01]Stop all movement on screen.
[188:17.03]Stop playing Halo.
[188:23.25]Well, hmm.
[188:27.36]I'm at 1,000k up right now.
[188:29.88]This is bad.
[188:33.54]We're going even lower.
[188:39.66]Uh...
[188:41.53]My voice is taking up all the bitrate.
[188:43.45]Well, we'll see.
[188:44.53]Let's give this a minute or two.
[188:46.21]A wink right now?
[188:47.73]Bad time for a wink.
[188:49.34]This is going to be a low-quality wink.
[188:54.82]I, like, forgot how to do it.
[188:59.84]I'm going to go BRB for a minute.
[189:01.71]I'm just going to check on some things.
[189:03.73]And I'll be back in a... Let's try to ride this out and see what happens.
[189:06.81]I'll be right back.
[191:34.40]Okay.
[191:36.30]I am back.
[191:38.26]I think we've returned to normal.
[191:40.60]Let's see.
[191:44.78]It says I'm doing alright.
[191:48.34]Let's give it some more frame data.
[191:50.54]I think we're okay, right?
[191:59.93]That's kind of a major...
[192:03.67]Let's hope that doesn't happen again.
[192:04.59]Because that just, like, kind of killed the stream for, like, a full five minutes.
[192:15.21]But let's keep going.
[192:18.77]I'm monitoring it over here.
[192:19.74]Let's see if it happens again.
[192:20.64]We'll have to figure it out, right?
[192:22.92]Alright, let's go.
[192:25.06]What was I doing?
[192:31.80]You're muted.
[192:32.54]What?
[192:32.92]I'm not...
[192:36.45]Actually, I'm going to put this in a different spot on my computer so I can really view it.
[192:40.17]Alright, let's do it.
[192:43.27]Yeah, we're fine.
[192:57.58]I just ran into something, some kind of weird traffic problem, but we're good.
[193:00.94]Alright, I gotta get the rings, right?
[193:02.83]Yeah, the rings, rings, rings, rings.
[193:04.97]Viewers plummeted.
[193:05.99]Well, I don't blame them.
[193:08.51]I mean, if the stream is, like, dying, you know, I'd probably be like, oh, whatever, it's all good.
[193:13.49]Alright, I got stuff for you.
[193:22.44]Yes.
[193:25.50]Here's another one of these.
[193:28.48]Did you wink?
[193:29.06]I winked.
[193:36.04]33.
[193:36.32]It's 33.
[193:37.02]33 per frog ring?
[193:42.52]Traffic problem.
[193:43.30]Oh, shit.
[193:43.76]The rumor is in his house.
[193:45.46]Imagine just having, like, five cars in your living room all beeping at each other.
[193:55.16]Get out of the way!
[193:56.46]I'm trying to get to work!
[194:01.41]Now that, yes, now that is a real one.
[194:04.17]That's a real one that just came in.
[194:05.53]Bang.
[194:07.05]I felt that one.
[194:08.01]I felt that one in my brain.
[194:09.07]Alright.
[194:12.69]Next thing on the list was... What the hell was the next thing on the list?
[194:19.63]I did the basement.
[194:20.29]Let me look at my items.
[194:25.29]I got a lot of trash.
[194:25.87]Let me throw the trash away.
[194:28.64]Oh yeah, climb the tower.
[194:29.78]The tower.
[194:30.22]Climb the tower.
[194:30.86]Alright, let me... Where's the trash?
[194:32.08]I got a ton of fucking junk.
[194:45.66]You do wings for bar mitzvahs.
[194:48.52]What?
[194:57.82]Alright, there goes all the junk.
[194:59.88]Do you?
[195:00.40]No, I don't.
[195:01.22]I don't.
[195:01.66]Okay, if you have my stream open, and you're at your Bar Mitzvah, and you've accumulated 75,000 points, sure, I will wink at your Bar Mitzvah.
[195:19.52]Now we're gonna go upstairs.
[195:23.94]No, no, I wanna do the car thing first.
[195:25.10]I wanna do the, what is it, the training?
[195:33.02]I wanna do the training.
[195:35.32]It's the only thing I haven't done over here.
[195:37.42]And I gotta pick up this candy box.
[195:58.65]Got it.
[196:00.09]Okay.
[196:01.79]Now let's do the training.
[196:10.98]Uh-oh.
[196:11.22]Are we dying again?
[196:13.08]Why am I dying?
[196:16.58]I don't understand.
[196:17.42]What's going on here?
[196:20.54]What the fuck is this happening for?
[196:23.46]Is it the... It might be the Twitch server I'm connected to.
[196:27.77]Maybe the Twitch server's fucked up.
[196:29.11]Because my internet seems like it's fine.
[196:30.69]It might be, like, the Twitch's ingest server that I'm connected on.
[196:45.24]Alright, this exercise teaches you how to shoot at Tau instead of your fellow soldiers.
[196:48.85]Okay.
[196:51.19]Or I climb this vine to head into the jungle.
[196:59.75]Intelligence indicates animals.
[197:03.14]And enemies are in the area.
[197:06.38]Eliminate all the enemies without harming the animals.
[197:08.46]Alright, I'll try.
[197:11.58]And use your chibi copter to fly down to the drop point.
[197:16.89]Okay.
[197:19.11]I think I got the range.
[197:20.99]Alright, hurry up, up!
[197:22.59]How high do I have to go?
[197:30.83]You're no robot, you're a slack bot.
[197:32.59]How high do I have to go?
[197:35.89]Keep going?
[197:46.62]All the way.
[197:47.30]Oh, God.
[197:48.10]Oh, shit.
[197:49.04]Can I... I thought I had to shoot stuff.
[198:21.15]Alright, all the way up.
[198:22.35]Then go to the drop point.
[198:23.71]OH!
[198:25.99]I'm fine.
[198:26.43]Alright, climb it!
[198:36.40]Do I have to climb?
[198:38.84]I'm trying to climb it!
[198:40.80]What are you doing?! !
[198:54.68]I made it.
[198:58.22]No, I didn't.
[199:06.32]Turn the camera.
[199:06.97]I was trying.
[199:07.75]It wouldn't do it.
[199:08.39]Didn't even shoot anyone.
[199:15.21]I thought I was gonna be shooting and moving.
[199:25.62]Wasting time on my hot drive.
[199:28.74]Can we just restart?
[199:31.24]The jungle is just crawling with danger.
[199:32.78]Alright, can I restart?
[199:34.38]Sarge, can we do this again?
[199:37.89]Sarge, I want to do this again.
[199:38.81]Sarge, I want to do this again.
[199:55.63]When the camera turns, you end up falling off the fucking thing.
[200:05.16]No do-overs, maggot!
[200:23.27]Okay, so what- I don't understand what happened here.
[200:26.53]I climbed all the way up here.
[200:28.35]I can't... I couldn't climb up the second vine.
[200:31.17]When I tried to climb the second vine, he decided to climb down the one I was going... Like, what do I do from here?
[200:37.50]Go all the... Can I have to go up here?
[200:38.84]Or... Turn around.
[200:43.38]I thought we were going just laterally.
[200:53.58]I didn't think we were going back.
[200:57.60]I'm not going to put the copter away.
[200:58.86]Climb it.
[201:04.11]CLIMB IT!
[201:10.29]Oh my god.
[201:10.95]Do not hurt the animals.
[201:13.25]Eliminate the enemies.
[201:14.35]Oh, come on.
[201:37.42]Well, I can't wait to do this again in less than two minutes.
[201:41.34]Move to the drop point.
[201:47.04]Okay, drop point.
[201:55.11]Put on the propeller.
[201:56.89]Alright, where is it?
[201:59.39]Straight down?
[202:00.15]Where is it?
[202:00.55]I can't see it.
[202:03.27]Where is it?
[202:03.71]I'm gonna do it again.
[202:05.87]Shoot for a time of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
[202:08.27]Yes, sir.
[202:32.16]Well, I could definitely beat that record.
[202:33.54]Let's go.
[203:06.20]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[203:07.52]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[203:19.57]Go, up.
[203:25.67]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna run out of energy.
[203:27.53]Great.
[203:28.29]Shit, come on, really?
[203:29.41]No, I'm not.
[203:32.51]I'm not gonna run out of energy.
[203:37.16]I'm gonna run out of energy!
[203:40.88]I'm gonna run out of fucking energy!
[204:05.41]Could be faster to die.
[204:06.39]No, I have a battery pack.
[204:08.33]I don't want to waste a battery pack.
[204:10.23]I have to... God damn it, man.
[204:16.08]Why did I think that it was restarted?
[204:42.62]Fucking come on, why?
[204:44.66]Oh my god, I'm so annoyed.
[204:47.98]I just... Why can't I just re- just turn it off?
[204:56.57]Why do I have to do the whole thing?
[204:57.97]I'll just leave in the fucking room.
[205:11.81]If the timer keeps going, I'm gonna be pissed.
[205:17.29]I'm deserting.
[205:18.71]Oh my god.
[205:19.50]Where are you going?
[205:25.22]If the timer's still up there.
[205:27.74]Okay, we're fine.
[205:28.62]God.
[205:29.12]Targe?
[205:45.08]Do it again.
[205:56.47]You're gonna soft block yourself, that'd be funny.
[205:58.61]And for the love of God, can I please do this again?
[206:17.20]I've never seen this game before.
[206:18.16]What's happening?
[206:19.60]You're a little robot, and your job is to make a whole family happy.
[206:34.80]Save so you can restart?
[206:35.82]There will be no restart.
[206:37.40]There will be no restart.
[207:17.70]There will be no restart.
[207:22.44]Let's go.
[207:27.09]I'm trying to shoot this.
[207:37.11]It's hard to fucking aim at this thing.
[207:38.69]Gah.
[207:42.29]Am I dying again?
[207:43.17]Alright, after this I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[207:47.20]I'm gonna restart it.
[207:47.92]I'm gonna pick a different server.
[207:49.90]This is stupid.
[208:14.42]Alright.
[208:15.92]Let's get this done.
[208:16.74]I got it.
[208:17.70]I'm gonna try to do a couple things here.
[208:26.07]Alright.
[208:28.85]Actually, let me try to do this right now.
[208:31.07]The stream might not turn off.
[208:32.85]Let's see what happens.
[208:33.41]Ready?
[208:39.09]Three, two, one.
[208:41.04]I'll be back in two minutes.
[208:43.28]Not even.
[208:44.63]The stream might not even turn off.
