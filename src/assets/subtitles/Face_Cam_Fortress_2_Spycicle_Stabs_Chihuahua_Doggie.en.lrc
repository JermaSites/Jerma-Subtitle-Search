[00:08.40]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:09.90]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[00:13.60]Hold on, somebody is trying to call me.
[00:16.28]I want to show you something before this gets started.
[00:17.97]This is the goofiest dog ever.
[00:20.15]It's not Otto.
[00:21.35]Let's take a look.
[00:23.31]Hello!
[00:25.07]My name is Reesey.
[00:27.14]So this is a dog that I'm dog-sitting for right now.
[00:30.90]One of my sister's friends.
[00:31.94]It's her dog.
[00:33.38]He's just sitting here, or she's just sitting here on my lap.
[00:36.28]And she's going to be there for the remainder of the video.
[00:38.08]Don't worry, Otto is okay.
[00:40.41]He's down here.
[00:41.61]He was up there earlier, so I have plenty of time between the two dogs on the lap.
[00:46.13]So don't worry, I have not forgotten about Otto.
[00:49.15]But anyways, just wanted to show you that.
[00:50.15]I thought that was really funny.
[00:50.93]A little Chihuahua dog.
[00:52.46]So let's get started with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:56.16]So, let's get started here, playing as the spy.
[01:00.49]With the ambassador, the spy-cicle.
[01:04.65]And the... not the Red-Tape Recorder, the regular sapper.
[01:07.65]On Dustbowl, yeah baby.
[01:10.59]Dustbowl, baby.
[01:11.69]I also have the regular watch on today.
[01:15.12]And I'm going to get myself killed.
[01:18.52]Wow, wow, wow.
[01:19.48]Me and live spy don't do very well, as you've seen in previous videos.
[01:23.28]But this heavy...
[01:26.22]Give me a headshot.
[01:27.68]That's a... Is that a spy right there?
[01:29.23]Did I bump into a spy?
[01:31.63]Yeah!
[01:31.89]We're good.
[01:34.33]Yikes!
[01:35.15]Get away!
[01:35.73]No!
[01:35.79]Actually, what am I doing?
[01:38.85]I have this bicycle.
[01:40.17]What the hell am I doing?
[01:41.08]Let's see.
[01:43.14]Popper.
[01:43.54]Anybody here?
[01:44.16]Hmm.
[01:47.40]Don't look like it.
[01:50.10]Gotta get the health that's here.
[01:52.23]I gotta be real sneaky about this, guys.
[01:54.53]Hey, there's this goat!
[01:56.77]How did I miss him?
[01:58.53]Alright, this is good, good, good, good, good.
[02:02.30]This is what I want.
[02:03.46]I want them all to come out so I can get behind everybody.
[02:07.70]Probably not a good place to decloak, but I want the health.
[02:11.86]Alright, let's go up here.
[02:12.96]What is going on right now?
[02:13.86]Everyone's just, like, spawn camping.
[02:16.92]Oh, this is a good spot.
[02:18.10]Hey, everybody!
[02:18.92]I'm disguised as that guy, I think.
[02:23.36]Come on, do it again.
[02:26.40]Oh, he's fully charged.
[02:28.22]Oh my god!
[02:29.40]That guy's probably so mad!
[02:31.04]I just ruined that guy's Uber.
[02:34.59]I'm sorry, bro.
[02:36.63]I know how that feels.
[02:38.65]It's not a good feeling.
[02:41.55]And we got Sniper coming in.
[02:43.49]I'm gonna... Here we go.
[02:44.35]This is where I get found out.
[02:46.57]Nope, not quite yet.
[02:50.42]Little dog is walking on my lap.
[02:51.84]Little dog.
[02:52.32]No, we're okay.
[02:54.96]I gotta stop disguising as a scout.
[02:58.10]Hey, little dog, what are you doing?
[02:59.34]Come here.
[03:00.86]Spy pyro down here, I see.
[03:02.84]I can smell ya from a mile away.
[03:07.42]Come on, where is he?
[03:09.44]Oh!
[03:12.87]Thanks for the teleporter, mate.
[03:18.27]Can I headshot this guy?
[03:19.43]Nah, I was gonna go for it.
[03:21.83]I was gonna go for it.
[03:25.98]What's this guy's health?
[03:32.32]Oh, that was pretty.
[03:34.62]That was a pretty little thing, if I do say so myself.
[03:37.37]Give me this.
[03:38.83]Walking around with a bottle.
[03:40.83]Can I get another one?
[03:41.85]Wow, that... That's why I wanna make my escape.
[03:45.19]Make my escape.
[03:47.03]Oh...
[03:48.48]I thought I got him.
[03:50.24]Guess I was wrong.
[03:52.16]Sometimes you're wrong.
[03:53.02]Hey, what are you doing?
[03:54.70]Come here.
[03:55.88]Hey, what's the matter with you, huh?
[03:58.48]Sit back down.
[04:00.22]You're being crazy.
[04:02.74]I love right when I start recording, this is great.
[04:04.99]So I was playing with Boo for a little while before this.
[04:07.87]We actually went to get food in separate places.
[04:12.57]And he was as calm, as collected as you could be.
[04:16.13]Now he's kind of going all over the place.
[04:18.97]No!
[04:19.67]Pull it out!
[04:20.47]Oh yeah, Spicycle, baby.
[04:23.55]Spicycle gets you away from those pesky Pyros.
[04:28.31]But now all I got is this, and that guy saw right through me.
[04:33.24]You wanna call somebody on the phone?
[04:35.70]Okay, ready?
[04:37.00]He's like, what the heck?
[04:38.22]I don't know if you can see that or not.
[04:40.10]That's funny.
[04:40.54]Is that guy's name Wonderbread?
[04:45.63]Wonder Bread.
[04:47.07]I love Wonder Bread.
[04:48.39]Especially in the toaster with cheese on it.
[04:53.00]Oh no, we're gonna get capped.
[04:55.56]Oh, and that's the end of the game.
[04:58.80]Quick, taunt.
[05:01.64]Oh well.
[05:03.87]Please don't kill me.
[05:05.96]See what happened right there, Reesey?
[05:07.82]Is... we lost.
[05:09.70]We lost the game.
[05:10.50]I know it's... it's very, very horrible, very treacherous.
[05:13.74]But we get to go again, though.
[05:14.86]That's the good thing.
[05:15.52]Don't worry.
[05:16.36]You know, you never have to worry in these situations.
[05:18.46]Look in the audience.
[05:19.20]Go on.
[05:20.36]What do you think they have to say about this?
[05:23.18]I don't know, but I'm so tired.
[05:25.29]It's okay, little... little dog.
[05:27.41]I like to call him Little Dog.
[05:30.37]I like to call her Little Dog.
[05:33.29]Here's one thing that I, uh... Actually, we'll time travel through setup time, then I'll tell you my story.
[05:38.75]Okay.
[05:39.53]So what I was gonna say before is... Every single animal I've ever had... Has been a male.
[05:48.07]Every single one.
[05:50.15]And I don't know if that's because... I just don't... I don't know why that is.
[05:53.25]I just happen to be every animal... Actually, one cat...
[05:57.85]One cat that we had a long time ago, when I was... Jeez, I was probably 10 years old.
[06:03.41]We had a cat that his name was... her name was Maggie.
[06:06.72]But other than that, it's... I've had like 10 animals.
[06:09.46]And all of them have been male, and now we are spawn camping.
[06:12.16]I haven't... I've... Just please kill me.
[06:16.68]Now, should I just change... No, this is what we're gonna do.
[06:19.18]Change the other team, quick.
[06:21.08]And... stay spy.
[06:24.15]See if... see if I can make something happen here.
[06:27.54]Dead Ringer.
[06:28.40]Oh, where you going, dog?
[06:31.92]Dead ring?
[06:32.36]Can we dead ring out of here?
[06:34.74]Okay, we're alright.
[06:35.63]Okay.
[06:35.89]There we go.
[06:38.27]There we go.
[06:40.39]I am not a spy.
[06:43.99]You don't know.
[06:46.97]Hey, I got the kook rail.
[06:48.87]Looking for those pesky spy bastards.
[06:52.45]That is a medic being shot in the back.
[06:56.02]I need my knife.
[06:58.67]I'm gonna get that knife.
[06:59.93]What do we got up here?
[07:01.53]Anything?
[07:03.21]Got a lot of stuff.
[07:07.76]Oh, he got the health!
[07:10.00]It's alright, take a... Yeah, that's what I wanted.
[07:11.50]That's what I wanted.
[07:12.90]Get out of my face!
[07:15.92]Oh, this is not good!
[07:16.94]Standing right in this guy's face!
[07:18.79]Oh my... God!
[07:21.19]I thought I was gonna be able to backstab him.
[07:25.43]Oh, hey, come on, coitus, coitus!
[07:28.11]What do you got for a loadout?
[07:29.67]The Black Rose!
[07:31.65]Where'd he go?
[07:32.15]He, like, just disappeared.
[07:35.59]So, can we win this?
[07:36.41]Are we gonna come back from being... Well, actually, come back.
[07:39.91]Well, I was on the other team, and I was... Actually, I didn't really contribute to this at all.
[07:45.15]I was kind of just standing there talking.
[07:46.77]And somebody is calling my phone.
[07:50.57]This dog is like, what is that?
[07:51.85]It's a phone, it's just a phone, don't worry.
[07:57.22]Let's get them, boys!
[08:00.58]No!
[08:01.24]You were right, I was a spy.
[08:03.28]Now I'm a sniper.
[08:04.27]Oh, come on.
[08:09.87]Oh my god, this trick tree killed me!
[08:12.85]Listen, I can't talk right now.
[08:15.03]Buddy.
[08:15.89]Whoever you are.
[08:17.55]That wasn't even Burger Boy.
[08:18.53]Who the hell was that?
[08:20.75]That was like a random number.
[08:22.33]Like a bunch of random digits I've never seen before.
[08:26.54]I never answer those phone calls.
[08:29.30]Let me know in the comments section if you ever answer.
[08:31.40]Hello.
[08:33.10]If you ever answer.
[08:34.22]What are you doing?
[08:35.66]What are you doing, dog?
[08:37.33]Oh my god, dog.
[08:38.15]You can't really.
[08:39.83]How did I kill that scout?
[08:41.67]I can't.
[08:42.41]I could not tell you.
[08:46.63]Let's go for the sap and stab.
[08:47.83]You, uh, being a real... I can't even, like, play this game.
[08:51.71]Oh my god.
[08:52.69]Alright, listen.
[08:53.83]Listen, I know you want, like, kisses right now, but I'm, like, playing a game.
[08:59.07]Yeah.
[08:59.73]Alright, here.
[09:00.95]There's one for you.
[09:01.87]So get back to... You little freak.
[09:09.12]Alright, I gotta get a good sap and stab.
[09:12.78]I got dog lap issues.
[09:18.44]Thanks, dog.
[09:21.37]Oh, watch it.
[09:22.19]Watch it.
[09:23.33]Little dog.
[09:23.87]Little dog jumping.
[09:24.75]Little dog jumping off my lap.
[09:25.93]No, he's not.
[09:28.57]Anywhere to be seen.
[09:29.43]He is not... Oh, no!
[09:30.97]There he is!
[09:33.23]Oh, come on!
[09:33.79]I had it!
[09:35.21]No, dog!
[09:37.27]Come here.
[09:38.43]Come hither.
[09:38.85]Alright, you want to get down?
[09:40.45]Get down this way.
[09:41.93]Go that way.
[09:44.34]Now he's going to... Ten bucks.
[09:46.88]Ten bucks as he starts crying.
[09:50.90]He's going to be going... Is that a heavy right there?
[09:56.79]No, it's an engineer all the way back here.
[09:59.21]Oh, I just heard him.
[10:03.03]I just heard him go... I gotta... Alright, I'm going to switch off a spy after this.
[10:13.67]I'm gonna go demo, and I'm gonna try and just take out all the stuff.
[10:18.79]Oh, man.
[10:19.75]Oh, man.
[10:21.65]He the guy knows.
[10:22.41]He knows.
[10:23.33]He knows.
[10:23.65]They all know.
[10:24.61]They all know.
[10:27.35]Get him!
[10:28.01]Get him!
[10:28.27]I got him!
[10:29.18]Is there another set?
[10:29.76]Oh, there's another engineer!
[10:30.70]Damn it!
[10:33.14]Alright, let's do this.
[10:35.06]We're going.
[10:36.08]What is this setup?
[10:38.06]Oh, we need that engineer to build a teleporter.
[10:39.86]Oh, he's got one built.
[10:41.26]What is going on here?! !
[10:45.51]Did he just- he just taunt killed somebody, did you see that?
[10:49.17]That guy just taunt killed that pyro.
[10:51.66]Are you a spy?
[10:52.84]No, you're not.
[10:54.74]But you, on the other hand, are gonna get killed by the sentry that's in that room.
[11:00.42]Don't let him get it!
[11:02.18]Kill this guy!
[11:02.92]Shoot him!
[11:03.58]Do anything!
[11:06.22]Man, this thing- this is bad.
[11:09.51]Wall, come on, off the wall.
[11:11.29]Please let me in!
[11:12.11]Please let me in there!
[11:15.64]Anybody else?
[11:16.30]There's the sentry.
[11:17.36]Alright.
[11:19.16]If I can... I gotta figure out a solution here.
[11:22.06]This has gotta go like this.
[11:25.78]There's two sentries over there.
[11:27.43]There's... We got one.
[11:29.95]Me and the... What the hell, Ad?
[11:32.93]Both are down.
[11:33.87]Both are down.
[11:34.43]Both sentries are down.
[11:35.13]Let's go.
[11:35.59]Let's go.
[11:35.89]Let's go.
[11:36.21]Let's go.
[11:36.55]Let's go.
[11:36.87]Let's go.
[11:37.23]Let's go.
[11:37.57]Let's go.
[11:39.95]Come on.
[11:40.23]Come on.
[11:40.45]Come on.
[11:40.77]Ugh!
[11:41.59]Ugh!
[11:43.48]Only a minute and 50... What?
[11:45.09]How does this heavy keep getting back here?
[11:48.01]He's back here, like, every time.
[11:50.45]I was gonna sticky jump.
[11:51.85]What?
[11:54.89]I just killed somebody.
[11:57.68]No, I didn't.
[11:58.26]It's this fake scout right here.
[12:00.40]That was ridiculous, though.
[12:02.42]And what happened?
[12:02.82]What's going on with my frame rate?
[12:05.02]My, like, frame... Hold on.
[12:06.82]My frame rate's, like, exploding right now.
[12:10.58]That was crazy.
[12:12.30]Yeah, I don't think this is happening.
[12:14.54]Very ironic.
[12:15.72]I switched teams.
[12:16.89]And what's... Maybe I'm just going crazy.
[12:19.87]My framerate looks like it's dying, though.
[12:21.55]According to DXStory, that's not the case.
[12:24.21]But what on Earth?
[12:25.87]They have a teleporter over here.
[12:28.39]There is a teleporter right here.
[12:30.08]This has to go down right now.
[12:33.24]This has to happen right now.
[12:36.10]Who is in this room, dude?
[12:37.20]You are going down.
[12:39.92]Oh god, I just heard him.
[12:40.74]Where is he?
[12:42.91]Are we gonna win?
[12:43.67]We're gonna win the game!
[12:47.53]How did that happen?
[12:50.14]You know, I'll tell you how that happened.
[12:51.36]That's a spy.
[12:52.38]I'll tell you how that happened.
[12:53.90]They had a teleporter back here somewhere.
[12:56.74]And they all were just coming to the front lines and nobody was back there anymore.
[12:59.60]That's ridiculous.
[13:01.50]Oh my god.
[13:02.97]Well anyways, that's gonna wrap up Facecam Fortress 2 Monday's edition.
[13:06.53]Thank you so much for watching.
[13:07.49]I really do appreciate it, guys.
[13:09.11]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[13:10.55]And of course, take care, everybody.
[13:13.36]Really?
