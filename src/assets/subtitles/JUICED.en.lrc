[00:16.05]Welcome to Juiced.
[00:16.95]The game's starting right now, actually.
[00:18.77]Go, now, go.
[00:19.41]Come on, come on, come on.
[00:20.62]The goal of the game is that we need to make the Twitch emote.
[00:22.92]Come on, bring it over here.
[00:24.16]This is called Touch My Spaghetti.
[00:25.94]I need to make a Twitch emote.
[00:27.58]Remember.
[00:27.94]That's illegal.
[00:28.50]That's illegal.
[00:29.86]Global emote for a W. A W, boom.
[00:31.14]Yes, yes.
[00:32.12]Boom, what, K?
[00:33.30]What else, what else?
[00:34.03]Don't look at that.
[00:34.61]Look at your board.
[00:35.27]I got a P. What are you looking at them for?
[00:37.39]Is it every letter?
[00:38.05]I got a K. I got another K. I got another E. It's emotes because this is your job, literally.
[00:43.31]No, I broke the code.
[00:45.25]W, you need another W?
[00:49.36]How much time do we have?
[00:51.28]Stop, stop, stop.
[00:53.16]We got a G. Keck W. That's a real emote.
[00:57.46]That's one point.
[00:59.41]PP Poof.
[01:01.09]Yes.
[01:01.83]It's not capitalized.
[01:03.05]Oh, come on.
[01:04.35]But I'll let it fly this time.
[01:05.33]Two points.
[01:05.65]Is there anything else?
[01:08.84]That's it, two points.
[01:10.58]Okay, let's see this one right here.
[01:12.54]You know what, I'll let you guys present it.
[01:14.95]Present me your masterpiece.
[01:16.07]Okay, so this isn't really an email, but we spelled BMW, like the car.
[01:20.41]This is a car.
[01:21.80]And then this, this is pog.
[01:24.75]uh but that the g kind of fell apart a little bit but this is pog you guys are just enjoying right now BMW's car that's what I said okay the advantage is pretty bad anyway in the first round you guys definitely don't get it but yeah congratulations the advantage goes to ludwig and Austin alright we're going
[01:49.98]um yeah okay so the first game uh just like last time is going to be um human harmonizer no actually it's collective consciousness which is a little bit like hive mind uh Jerma and Connor how about you guys team name I can't see from here well we're the bismuth bald eagles uh bismuth as you know is one of the strongest metals on Earth yep and the bald eagle is pound for pound the strongest animal on Earth so that's all actually yeah it's alliteration Jesus what was that
[02:16.38]Okay, yeah, okay, so first question.
[02:19.36]It's a good name.
[02:20.62]It's a good name.
[02:21.50]Okay, yeah, okay, first question for a human, no, sorry.
[02:26.08]This will go for chat also, so you're getting to write your answers in chat, remember.
[02:29.70]First question is,
[02:32.26]Name something a streamer cannot live without.
[02:37.77]We've got to think.
[02:38.73]And then you have 60 seconds for chat.
[02:41.29]Adderall.
[02:41.77]Adderall is another streamer without Adderall.
[02:44.16]Yeah, it's true.
[02:44.86]What are you talking about?
[02:46.26]Yes, masturbating.
[02:47.74]I don't think that's it.
[02:48.80]You're feeding them answers.
[02:50.92]So the question again was name something a streamer can't live without and since you guys got the first game out of the way you guys won the advantage You guys go first with your first answer to that question.
[02:57.67]I saw a lot of forcing in the chat.
[02:59.35]I
[03:19.33]I did.
[03:19.89]You can't cheat and then say, I cheated a lot.
[03:22.65]Well, they already know.
[03:23.47]Cat's out of the bag.
[03:24.21]We might as well use it to our advantage.
[03:26.15]I think we go with chat.
[03:27.23]Okay, chat.
[03:28.19]We'll lock it in.
[03:28.93]Chat.
[03:29.57]Well, that's spicy.
[03:30.35]I like that a lot.
[03:31.17]You know what's going to suck is when they go with Forsen and get the top answer.
[03:35.09]Team top.
[03:36.12]First answer is chat.
[03:38.14]Omega Juice, please.
[03:39.04]Can we know if that's on the board or not?
[03:40.98]Omega Juice.
[03:41.76]Is that on the board?
[03:42.84]Oh, he's off planet right now.
[03:43.96]He's off planet right now.
[03:44.90]Yeah, yeah!
[03:48.46]He says it is!
[03:49.50]He says it is!
[03:51.56]That is not, that is a third answer.
[03:53.34]For an event, that's pretty bad.
[03:55.09]We cheated for the third answer.
[03:56.53]I told you, we didn't want to use what I suggested.
[03:58.83]It was good cheat.
[04:00.41]I know, I got spaghetti.
[04:01.29]What did we want to do first?
[04:03.93]I think, hey, we'll use the cheat.
[04:06.33]Let's do it.
[04:06.89]Yeah.
[04:07.73]The cheat?
[04:08.29]Yeah, we'll take Forsen.
[04:10.40]Forsen.
[04:11.60]Okay, Omega Juice, is Forsen on the board for the question?
[04:15.76]Yes, Felix.
[04:16.76]Sorry, I left all my juice at home and I had to go get it.
[04:19.94]Forsen is on the board.
[04:21.81]Where is it at, though?
[04:23.25]Well, I mean, you kind of know where it was.
[04:26.01]Yes!
[04:26.73]I think it was the top answer.
[04:28.55]I don't know.
[04:29.19]I'm so surprised.
[04:30.47]Team the Bismuth Bald Eagles.
[04:32.77]Guys.
[04:32.97]You got it.
[04:34.91]Okay, how would you even brand that team name anyway?
[04:36.98]BBB.
[04:37.72]It's the BBB.
[04:39.18]Oh, that's not too bad.
[04:40.66]BBB.
[04:41.18]Build back better Biden boys.
[04:43.52]Whatever.
[04:44.42]It's BBE.
[04:45.16]Yeah, that's what I said.
[04:47.18]BBC.
[04:47.34]Okay, how about an answer now?
[04:49.80]We're going to go with TikTok.
[04:51.07]That's it.
[04:52.42]Ooh, that's good because it's MyChat and not TikTok.
[04:56.70]That's not on the board.
[04:58.41]I don't do that much TikTok.
[05:00.13]No shot, it's on the board.
[05:01.41]Yeah, no shot, right?
[05:02.41]Prove them wrong.
[05:03.89]Not on the board.
[05:04.49]We love TikTok, Felix, but unfortunately, it's not on the board.
[05:10.77]Yes!
[05:11.33]That's not a win for you.
[05:13.26]That's a win for me.
[05:14.26]MyChat didn't say TikTok.
[05:15.42]Here's the deal, Ludwig.
[05:18.08]I think drugs could be on the board.
[05:20.62]It's crazy you think Twitch chat was cool enough to do drugs.
[05:24.28]It is not.
[05:25.78]Oh, come on.
[05:27.74]That's bullshit.
[05:30.02]There's a clever one, right?
[05:31.46]Yeah.
[05:32.06]We got a clever one, but we have, I don't know.
[05:34.24]He has one that I don't think makes any sense, but he's pretty happy about it.
[05:38.81]Food delivery.
[05:39.87]Oh, that one's good.
[05:40.93]That's a good one.
[05:41.55]Good answer.
[05:42.69]Good answer.
[05:43.25]We're talking about streamers, not Frosty.
[05:45.09]You know what I mean?
[05:46.93]It is unfortunately not a good answer.
[05:51.27]Wait a minute, that's crazy.
[05:52.25]That's two X's.
[05:53.33]What?
[05:54.11]Alright, I'm lost.
[05:55.01]35 is, they got, that's bullshit.
[05:58.41]We can pull ahead.
[05:59.65]So then, you guys have one more shot.
[06:02.11]Okay.
[06:02.55]No, no, no.
[06:03.45]It's zero, right?
[06:03.91]It's zero.
[06:04.47]It's done.
[06:05.54]Wait, no, it's not.
[06:06.12]We got one more shot.
[06:06.94]This round is done.
[06:07.60]We got to show the answers.
[06:08.52]You're right.
[06:09.04]It's three shots total.
[06:09.98]It's not the X's.
[06:10.72]I know the rule and you guys don't.
[06:12.78]I know how to run the show.
[06:14.22]Don't tell me how to run it.
[06:15.52]I know how to run the show.
[06:17.78]Don't tell me what to do.
[06:18.94]You guys got three answers?
[06:20.90]You guys got two?
[06:22.10]They're not good enough?
[06:22.98]We took their cheat and we won.
[06:24.07]The Bismuth Bald Eagles win.
[06:27.15]That's right.
[06:27.57]Yes.
[06:28.39]Can we clap?
[06:28.95]Yeah, they cheated though.
[06:30.41]Oh my goodness, give us the answers, the chat.
[06:32.75]Yes, the remaining answers were a PC, drama, and the internet.
[06:43.10]Okay.
[06:43.46]This is so basic.
[06:45.08]That is a little bit NPC.
[06:46.86]My chat is an NPC though, right?
[06:48.16]Yeah.
[06:48.26]What do you need to stream?
[06:49.84]Oxygen?
[06:51.80]her what about the Nintendo Switch yeah come on what about like the Xbox 360. we did games we gave him the games games do well in streaming video games 360 Jerma yeah like the Xbox One the one s how many hours of sleep do you need each night to feel awake the next day that's a hard one so
[07:19.05]60 seconds for chat.
[07:19.65]The timer starts now.
[07:21.09]60 seconds.
[07:22.00]People want to chat in the audience.
[07:24.10]Chat, this is you.
[07:25.18]Go and type your answer.
[07:26.18]I would say at least, you know, between one.
[07:28.68]How many hours of sleep did you get last night?
[07:30.79]Three.
[07:31.03]How many hours did you get last night?
[07:32.79]Three and a half.
[07:33.61]How do you feel?
[07:34.07]I got three.
[07:39.11]Not that refreshed probably.
[07:41.01]How many did I get?
[07:41.91]He knows.
[07:42.69]Yeah, because you were in bed and I said, Felix, we've got to get up.
[07:45.57]And he said, okay.
[07:46.57]And then I came back five minutes later, you're still in bed.
[07:49.08]Yeah, I baited him.
[07:51.14]Did you do the thing where you got up out of bed and started putting your socks on?
[07:54.60]Yeah, but I baited him.
[07:55.62]Oh, yeah, yeah, I put my socks on.
[07:56.70]And I walked away.
[07:58.00]And he did the thing where he goes, oh, I got up, I got up.
[08:00.23]And then he went right back down.
[08:01.79]Yeah, I just put my socks on.
[08:03.09]Felix, did you think you were going to get away with it?
[08:05.33]But I did, like five times.
[08:07.73]To get revenge, he went to take a shower and I set up a mannequin right in front of the shower door.
[08:13.32]And I sat outside the room and he opened it and went, ah!
[08:16.72]Yeah, we'll move a little bit.
[08:17.72]Dude, the I'm putting my socks on thing works every time.
[08:19.90]Oh, you put your socks on?
[08:21.19]No, you just go, yeah, I'm just putting my socks on.
[08:23.11]Oh, I sleep fully clothed.
[08:24.19]That wouldn't work.
[08:24.99]You sleep fully clothed?
[08:26.45]What the hell?
[08:27.05]Yeah.
[08:27.49]Like a serial killer.
[08:35.14]keep it simple like the doctor orders eight hours eight hours yep oh my god juice eight hours NPC answer is that on the board or not that is on the board and it is the number one answer
[08:53.67]Yeah, they had to cue the clap track.
[08:57.85]Can we give like a range?
[09:01.15]You cannot give a range.
[09:02.27]If you give a range, it's lame.
[09:03.39]It's worth a shot.
[09:04.65]We're going to go with seven.
[09:07.44]Seven.
[09:08.26]Yeah, if you guys watch other shows, you know that seven is usually not a good answer overall.
[09:12.60]But, you know, Omega Juice, I bet you proved me wrong.
[09:14.40]Maybe it was seven.
[09:15.10]Seven.
[09:15.66]Is that on the board or not?
[09:16.86]I feel like seven is on the board.
[09:18.82]It's got to be low.
[09:20.59]I'm thinking Mark Wahlberg, 4am crew, get up early, get out, get at it, six hours.
[09:24.79]He's a hero.
[09:25.17]Six hours.
[09:25.61]That's a good answer because that's like, it's eight, seven, six.
[09:41.38]He could have done it.
[09:42.46]He could have done it.
[09:43.14]If he was there.
[09:43.74]If he was there, he could have stopped it.
[09:44.82]They're running away with this one, Felix.
[09:46.80]Six is on the board.
[09:48.72]And it's number two.
[09:50.86]Yes!
[09:51.14]Come on.
[09:52.06]Come on.
[09:52.52]I need this fucking shot.
[09:54.24]Everything was done.
[09:55.76]Jeremiah, you're a smart guy, aren't you?
[09:57.39]that's it yeah they can't even come yeah you're one of the smarter you know type guy right yeah I think so okay then look at the board and tell me give me an answer to the board tell me what you see here they gotta get all of them I feel like they could go either way it could be like oh like I can get two and be fine right or you know if you go with the safe one and say what I'm gonna say that's five
[10:16.85]That's ballsy.
[10:17.67]It's not on the board.
[10:18.29]He says five.
[10:20.35]Omega Juice, this crazy answer is on the board.
[10:23.07]Five.
[10:23.75]Five hours.
[10:24.37]It is not on the board and it is crazy.
[10:26.75]Wait, I see it.
[10:27.74]So what, two?
[10:28.92]Not as crazy as what the next best answer is.
[10:32.40]I'm actually so bad.
[10:33.10]12?
[10:33.36]Okay.
[10:35.16]We'll crunch the numbers.
[10:36.12]Get walkie.
[10:37.00]10.
[10:37.02]10 hours.
[10:37.96]Yeah, even numbers.
[10:39.16]6, 8, 10.
[10:39.22]10.
[10:39.86]I would have thought you guys was a zero, but Omega Juice, they say 10 hours.
[10:46.08]Is 10 on the board or not?
[10:47.54]10 is not on the board.
[10:49.62]Oh, go fuck yourself.
[10:50.24]Holy fuck yourself.
[10:51.98]How is that possible?
[10:54.03]It's just too much.
[10:54.78]It's got to be something.
[10:55.44]It's got to be like a comedy thing.
[10:56.52]Like, oh, like 15 or something.
[10:57.94]Yeah, like nine.
[10:59.10]How about, since you guys are really bad at both games, how about we do a compromise?
[11:02.92]If you guys get one answer on the board, you win the round.
[11:05.60]Nine.
[11:06.93]No way.
[11:07.41]That's not how it works.
[11:08.79]What is that?
[11:09.49]That's not how it works.
[11:10.79]I don't hear what they think.
[11:11.99]That sounds like fun.
[11:13.41]Last answer.
[11:13.79]Come on.
[11:14.49]Nine.
[11:15.29]They say nine.
[11:15.83]Is that not a bottle of mega juice?
[11:17.40]No shot.
[11:21.62]14 or 20.
[11:22.52]I cannot imagine what's on the board.
[11:25.46]The next highest answer was adept.
[11:30.28]No way.
[11:31.06]Then zero.
[11:32.23]What number is that?
[11:33.15]And finally, forcing.
[11:36.69]How does that even count?
[11:37.87]Those aren't even numbers.
[11:38.89]Those aren't even numbers.
[11:41.86]Guys, there's no chat answers, remember?
[11:44.77]It's an interactive show.
[11:47.46]I guess it's like you would have a good night of sleep if you, and hypothetically, I'm not speaking from any personal experiences whatsoever, were to sleep with the deft.
[11:56.76]Name a fruit that reminds you of a part of the human body.
[12:01.69]Oh, come on, everybody.
[12:02.81]Okay, come on.
[12:03.79]Do we get to go first?
[12:04.79]I need to get my shoes.
[12:05.99]I'm not going to go.
[12:06.79]Is that what they do with booze?
[12:12.68]Remember, this is Twitch chat.
[12:14.26]Also, this tip goes specific for Jerma.
[12:17.07]You know what?
[12:17.51]I got it.
[12:17.85]It's Twitch chat.
[12:19.05]Not your good answers in your head.
[12:20.87]If this is not number one, then I don't understand.
[12:23.15]Humanity.
[12:24.16]Banana.
[12:24.54]It's banana.
[12:25.02]It has to be.
[12:26.26]It has to be.
[12:26.72]Okay.
[12:28.40]Okay, yeah.
[12:29.78]That's not what I would have written.
[12:31.74]Is that what you would have went for, number one?
[12:33.08]I would call that a bad answer.
[12:34.73]Terrible answer.
[12:35.57]Dog shit.
[12:35.93]Did these guys use their advantage while I was on the board?
[12:38.77]Nope.
[12:39.41]So, I don't have a body, and I don't really understand this one, but this answer didn't do very well.
[12:45.87]Oh, God.
[12:47.14]Who would have thought?
[12:47.78]What are you talking about?
[12:50.46]I warned you.
[12:52.08]I warned you.
[12:52.60]Just use your laser eyes and shut him up.
[12:54.92]Cucumber.
[12:56.04]Yeah, but that.
[12:56.44]Chat thinks bigger.
[12:57.64]No, but that's right up the same alley as banana.
[13:00.82]No, no.
[13:01.16]It's Twitch chat.
[13:01.98]It's nothing like that.
[13:02.48]They'll do macaroni.
[13:03.38]Melons has got to be up there.
[13:04.80]Macaroni's not a fruit.
[13:05.66]It's a pasta.
[13:06.58]Melons has got to be up there.
[13:07.88]It's Twitch chat.
[13:08.82]I just told you three times.
[13:09.54]That's right.
[13:10.00]I know.
[13:10.26]Okay.
[13:11.02]They vlog in melons.
[13:11.88]Omega juice.
[13:12.56]Is that on the board or not?
[13:14.37]Tell us right now.
[13:15.01]People don't have to think melons, it seems.
[13:18.57]Oh.
[13:19.93]Whoa!
[13:20.49]That's a whole cookie.
[13:22.15]That's a zero.
[13:23.11]That's a big deal.
[13:24.51]Are you kidding me?
[13:26.74]Is melon a fruit?
[13:27.48]Game changer.
[13:27.92]This is huge.
[13:29.26]No, we needed this.
[13:30.30]Banana is a dumb answer.
[13:32.54]I don't like bananas.
[13:33.14]It's a stupid answer.
[13:36.14]They're bragging about number five on the board, by the way.
[13:39.26]So, can I get your answer?
[13:40.53]Yeah, Forsen.
[13:41.95]Forsen.
[13:42.65]Oh, shit.
[13:43.95]Surely, this is on the board.
[13:45.75]Omega Juice, Forsen again.
[13:48.61]Calder, that was a great answer.
[13:51.02]No, it's not.
[13:51.72]Thank you, Omega Juice.
[13:52.74]Right?

[13:56.16]Stop, okay.
[13:57.16]Adept.
[13:57.90]What?
[13:58.60]We're locking in adept.
[14:00.72]Alright, for the next shows, we're gonna have a banned answer.
[14:03.15]We're gonna ban outright adept.
[14:05.15]What's wrong with adept?
[14:05.85]We're going adept.
[14:06.33]Because I'll never be able to move on with my life.
[14:07.77]You guys just keep saying adept all the time, man.
[14:09.57]Well, it's on the board.
[14:10.75]If it's on the board, you're trying to play the game out here.
[14:12.71]We're locking it in, yes.
[14:13.57]Oh, Jamaica Juice is adept on the board.
[14:15.37]I mean, I think you know.
[14:17.66]Fuck off.
[14:19.28]It's the number one answer.
[14:20.08]Yeah!
[14:29.45]like the entire time what was he supposed to do they're on an island your last answer yeah guys you're gonna try your best I mean I feel pretty deflated but what would be number two if not adapt or force them uh
[14:44.95]255 against 150.
[14:45.51]Oh, they need to get the number two answer.
[14:46.87]It's got to be massive.
[14:48.33]Maybe it is cucumber.
[14:50.17]No.
[14:50.60]No, but that's a good one.
[14:53.50]These are too smart.
[14:54.70]They think too much.
[14:55.78]Yeah.
[14:56.02]You know the Squidward thing where he takes the brain off?
[14:59.71]That's what you have to do to get under the show.
[15:01.51]You take your brain off.
[15:02.79]What would be number two?
[15:03.71]Banana is number one everywhere, right?
[15:06.46]Everywhere.
[15:07.56]Not here.
[15:08.24]What's number two?
[15:09.20]You know what?
[15:09.54]You know what?
[15:10.26]They get a hint.
[15:11.56]Think.
[15:12.44]No, they don't.
[15:13.12]Think.
[15:14.12]No, don't think.
[15:15.22]Give me an answer for fuck's sake.
[15:16.32]Think about an object on a human being that could be related to a fruit.
[15:19.97]Isn't it actually a vegetable?
[15:21.35]We almost threw up a vegetable.
[15:22.65]I don't know.
[15:23.55]I don't know.
[15:24.47]How about xQc?
[15:26.71]Oh, man.
[15:27.25]See, they're trying to go with the memes.
[15:29.11]They don't have what it takes.
[15:29.89]They don't know the memes.
[15:30.43]Oh my god, Juice, tell me it's not on the board.
[15:32.09]It's not.
[15:32.69]I really thought it would be the one.
[15:35.33]What do you know?
[15:36.27]If Cucumber's up there, I'm going to puke.
[15:37.59]You know what?
[15:37.93]I'm going to play my own fucking game.
[15:40.47]The answers on the board are going to be eggplant, peach, coconut.
[15:45.86]Oh my god, Juice, send it.
[15:47.02]That was unbelievably close.
[15:49.46]Peach, eggplant, and the final answer, E-Rob.
[15:53.38]Fuck.
[15:56.36]Damn.
[15:58.00]You know your chat.
[15:59.34]That's why I'm not playing the show.
[16:01.41]I'd be crushing you guys.
[16:02.15]Yeah, that's fair.
[16:04.72]Welcome back to Juiced.
[16:06.81]where Team Ludwig and Team Top, they have one juice score.
[16:10.61]And they get a chance to get another one with this game called Hold My Balls.
[16:14.85]You have to hold as many balls as possible.
[16:18.23]Austin seems excited for this one.
[16:19.11]Yeah, I have a lot of experience, Felix.
[16:22.09]60 seconds.
[16:22.39]There's no technique.
[16:23.07]There's no rule set for this one.
[16:25.31]Just hold it.
[16:26.15]I will be the ball holder.
[16:27.55]You'll be the ball holder.
[16:28.56]Yes.
[16:28.82]And I give you my balls to hold.
[16:30.34]That's right.
[16:30.92]Ooh, you know what?
[16:32.18]My lips are jarred right now.
[16:33.34]Oh, are they?
[16:33.84]What?
[16:38.42]Did they get?
[16:39.20]It just cuts it Jerma doing exercise.
[16:40.96]Wait, what?
[16:41.30]Did they miss that?
[16:42.44]Yeah, it was just Jerma doing this.
[16:44.80]Did they miss that shot?
[16:45.98]I was preparing.
[16:46.57]I was stretching.
[16:47.75]My lips are dry.
[16:48.41]Okay.
[16:50.85]What is going on here?
[16:52.91]Did they get that one?
[16:54.17]They don't get points for that, right?
[16:55.77]Hold as many balls as possible.
[16:57.05]Okay, I'm ready.
[16:57.79]Don't drop them.
[16:58.61]I won't.
[16:59.17]Wait, if we drop them, can we re-hold the balls?
[17:01.29]Hey, guys.
[17:01.81]Yes, you can put them up.
[17:02.75]At the end, you need to start and have all the balls.
[17:04.45]Ready?
[17:05.68]Be careful of that lactic acid that builds up in your knees.
[17:07.76]Go, go, go, get down, stop, stop, stop.
[17:09.30]Bring your knees closer, bring your knees closer.
[17:10.80]I got to put one in there, put one in there.
[17:12.04]Okay.
[17:12.54]Same strat.
[17:13.20]Don't worry.
[17:15.37]I got a lot of bullets.
[17:16.09]Get out of here, get out of here.
[17:17.87]Oh, shit.
[17:18.89]I'm sorry, sorry.
[17:19.91]Let's get this out of here.
[17:21.63]And then let's get this.
[17:23.77]See, you put this one in.
[17:25.15]Jeremy and Connor are kind of clutching this up.
[17:26.77]This would be an embarrassing thing to lose, Ludwig.
[17:29.41]It would be pretty bad.
[17:30.17]This is all I'm known for.
[17:33.11]Yeah, this is pretty smart.
[17:34.79]Wait a minute.
[17:35.69]Wait.
[17:36.13]Hey, I said no ruleset.
[17:38.03]Yeah, he's allowed.
[17:39.55]He's allowed.
[17:40.05]I don't think so.
[17:41.59]Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
[18:02.16]Okay, now I'm gonna count them.
[18:03.30]I'm gonna count, I'm gonna count them.
[18:05.08]One, let go.
[18:06.26]Let go, man.
[18:07.00]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:11.89]Let go!
[18:12.89]Six, seven, eight.
[18:14.17]What is so annoying?
[18:16.19]That's eight.
[18:16.93]Eight?
[18:17.67]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[18:22.61]Yeah!
[18:24.71]That was the eighth one.
[18:27.34]My shoes are slippery.
[18:28.92]It was too slippery.
[18:30.70]What was that?
[18:31.60]You got longer shoes?
[18:32.24]Sure, we do have longer shoes.
[18:33.34]Alright, get the fuck out.
[18:34.50]I'll do your move now.
[18:35.38]Nice, nice, nice.
[18:38.78]No, you can't do it like that.
[18:39.80]Come on.
[18:42.04]It is time to determine your bond with your teammate I have precisely picked your partners for absolute max synergy, but you still must be optimized for performance
[19:10.44]In this task, I will banish one half of each team to an isolation chamber to ensure maximum integrity.
[19:18.11]Then we will ask their teammates to anticipate how their partner would answer.
[19:23.27]Any true partner should manage this easily.
[19:26.63]I can psych him out.
[19:27.21]Send me back.
[19:28.07]So who's going?
[19:28.89]He's going.
[19:29.31]I'm going to be going.
[19:30.47]Then get the fuck out.
[19:31.69]It was a pleasure.
[19:32.29]Thanks for the opportunity.
[19:35.26]Okay, first question is, have they answered yet?
[19:38.57]On the front at the same time you have to write on the board.
[19:40.72]Yeah, they're right on your on your on the back Yeah, yes.
[19:44.70]Okay.
[19:44.98]So first question is it who is your partner's favorite streamer?
[19:50.60]Oh fuck so Then I'm gonna ask them who is your favorite streamer and have to guess what you wrote So don't double double at the end that you're good at writing mine or there's who is your partner's favorite shimmer?
[20:02.67]There's and when they go on
[20:04.93]I'll ask them who is yours, and it's going to have to match your answer.
[20:07.33]Okay, I got it.
[20:08.73]You have time.
[20:09.47]You have time.
[20:09.83]You can kind of think a little bit.
[20:11.57]This time it's not chat answering, it's you guys answering.
[20:13.39]Right.
[20:14.29]If you look at the back, these guys are thinking really... What the fuck are they doing?
[20:17.98]I don't want to see that.
[20:21.62]I don't know what... You brought your answers, yeah.
[20:26.82]I think I spelled it wrong.
[20:31.01]Oh, man.
[20:31.83]Man, one day we're just gonna put a prize pool to just stop answering this shit like that.
[20:36.07]Just actual good answers.
[20:37.33]Bro, I don't know.
[20:38.21]Ludwig and I, we don't know.
[20:40.96]So that's it.
[20:42.28]Okay.

[20:49.55]And say hello to our good guest.
[20:51.35]I'm sorry.
[20:51.67]We didn't get any points on this one, but I'm confident that you'll know what I'm going to answer.
[20:55.05]You're right.
[20:55.67]The things that he did to me in there are unspeakable.
[20:57.79]We should get points for how much I destroyed him.
[20:59.72]What did you guys do in there?
[21:00.60]He hurt me.
[21:02.04]Are you okay?
[21:02.72]No.

[21:47.98]I'm biased host.
[21:49.16]Ludwig, who is your favorite streamer?

[21:55.35]Fuck off.
[21:55.93]Yeah, baby.
[21:56.97]How did you know that?
[21:58.43]That was easy.
[22:00.07]I can't believe.
[22:01.69]This is what I was talking about.
[22:04.13]Honestly, I can't believe we got it right.
[22:06.07]What do you...
[22:08.31]spend too much money on you as a Jerma.
[22:11.87]Oh, come on.
[22:13.01]It shows.
[22:14.59]Shows.
[22:16.11]Oh, yeah.
[22:16.89]Yeah.
[22:17.11]He wrote that.
[22:18.01]Another point.
[22:18.67]Here it comes.
[22:19.15]Flip it over.
[22:19.63]No, it's not.
[22:21.46]I mean, it's accurate.
[22:23.34]It's accurate.
[22:23.92]It's accurate.
[22:25.08]How much do you have to be spending on moisturizer?
[22:28.48]He talks about it a lot.
[22:29.42]I do talk about it a lot.
[22:30.22]What's your moisturizer?
[22:31.87]It is the Believe Aqua Balm.
[22:34.49]Oh, very good choice.
[22:36.06]Yeah, and how about you tell us what you have in your pocket earlier?
[22:38.32]Yeah, he's got like lip balm on a Q-tip.
[22:40.10]You're actually calling me out for this?
[22:42.28]Yeah, pull it out, man.
[22:43.20]I mean, it's not, so it's...
[22:46.30]This looks fucking funny.
[22:47.66]That is a gab that you smoke weed out of.
[22:50.62]No, this is not drugs.
[22:51.74]It's in a drug baggie, but it doesn't mean it's drugs.
[22:53.76]You can only buy that.
[22:55.90]Yeah, it's not drugs, guys.
[22:57.08]Remember, not drugs.
[22:58.44]Don't do the drugs.
[22:59.34]Why is this so dirty?
[22:59.96]He's a psycho.
[23:00.99]Why is this so dirty?
[23:02.27]Can he do that on the stream?
[23:03.23]He's already high.
[23:03.73]Can you see this?
[23:04.09]Look how dirty this is.
[23:05.37]X, you can't have him doing drugs on your stream.
[23:06.69]Don't zoom in.
[23:07.23]It's not drugs, I promise.
[23:08.43]No, it's not.
[23:08.95]It goes in your nose.
[23:11.61]What do you spend too much money on?
[23:14.49]Pokémon cards.
[23:15.73]No way.
[23:17.93]Oh, man.
[23:19.50]Wait a minute.
[23:20.14]I said Pokimane.
[23:21.38]I did spell Pokémon wrong.
[23:23.12]He said Pokimane cards.
[23:24.54]Pokimane cards.
[23:25.48]What the hell is a Pokimane?
[23:27.46]I was trying to write Pokémon.
[23:29.58]You give me the fucking points.
[23:30.60]That's not even close.
[23:31.58]No.
[23:32.20]I'm the judge here.
[23:33.20]No, no, no.
[23:33.68]Come on, come on, come on.
[23:34.78]Oh, my God.
[23:35.34]No.
[23:36.45]X, X, X, X. Come on.
[23:39.21]Pokémon, Pokémon.
[23:40.77]This is what I... Oh, my God.
[23:42.53]Let me think.
[23:42.99]Back the fuck up.
[23:43.57]Come on, X. Come on.
[23:44.63]Let me think.
[23:45.15]Dude, it's so perfect.
[23:46.27]Let me think.
[23:46.77]Think about the chances.
[23:47.81]We don't even know each other.
[23:49.03]You want to know my thought process?
[23:49.91]I'll tell you the thought process.
[23:50.85]Okay, hear me.
[23:51.35]Here's the thought process behind all of it, okay?
[23:54.43]Okay.
[23:55.05]So, two shows in a row, these guys worked super hard on a tiebreaker.
[23:59.13]We never see the tiebreakers, right?
[24:00.87]No, X. No, X. If I give you guys the point, you guys go to three, and they tie it up, right?
[24:06.86]Right?
[24:07.30]And it goes tiebreaker.
[24:08.32]That's the only way we get there.
[24:09.78]You guys get the point.
[24:10.68]Pokémon Go is in there.
[24:11.48]Yeah!
[24:18.08]It's just one game.
[24:22.01]What color is your shirt?
[24:25.57]You, the Jerma.
[24:26.93]So you could just go.
[24:27.61]What color is my shirt?
[24:29.27]Yes, your shirt.
[24:30.09]What color is it?
[24:30.53]I don't think I got this one.
[24:31.38]What color is my shirt that I have underneath this?
[24:33.74]He's not wearing a shirt.
[24:34.52]Thank you.
[24:34.98]Is it black?
[24:36.68]It's a black.
[24:37.58]Come on, flip it over.
[24:39.42]What does it say?
[24:40.56]Green?
[24:40.96]Green.
[24:41.12]Not the answer.
[24:41.80]Okay, it doesn't matter.
[24:43.17]Not the answer.
[24:43.73]Not the answer.
[24:44.21]What are you wearing for the big shows?
[24:46.19]Oh, man.
[24:47.87]Hey.
[24:47.95]Do it, do it, do it.
[24:50.49]I got dressed first before he even showed up.
[24:53.08]I didn't even see what he was wearing.
[24:54.50]Oh, black.
[24:55.62]How funny.
[24:56.66]Whoa.
[24:58.04]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:00.62]I didn't think that any of these were correct.
[25:03.20]Hey, at this point, I don't even care.
[25:06.46]I don't even care.
[25:07.42]We're going to contest this.
[25:09.36]Wait, hold on.
[25:10.64]What are you going to contest?
[25:11.70]Give me like one second.
[25:12.34]These guys are contesting the point.
[25:13.27]What's up?
[25:14.73]I got here late.
[25:15.69]I didn't even see his shirt.
[25:16.95]I was already dressed.
[25:17.59]I didn't have a chance.
[25:18.19]I'll be honest with you.
[25:18.83]That sounds like a him problem to me.
[25:20.09]Yeah, who the fuck asked about this?
[25:21.31]Yeah, it sounds like a him problem.
[25:23.53]What was it with the moisture?
[25:25.11]How much have you spent on moisturizers in the past year?
[25:26.89]Ballpark.
[25:27.83]I don't know, maybe like a couple hundred bucks in a year.
[25:30.24]A couple hundred?
[25:31.56]Maybe, total.
[25:33.56]Totally.
[25:33.98]One of those lasts like two or three months.
[25:36.06]You can buy a lot of those.
[25:37.18]Buy like three or four of them a year, once a quarter.
[25:39.26]Sure.
[25:39.84]It goes on your face.
[25:40.90]Moisturize your faces, folks.
[25:43.66]This round is way hard for you guys.
[25:48.99]You need to write good answers.
[25:50.91]Good answers compared to the other game.
[25:53.55]So the first one is what was your partner's first gaming console?
[25:59.19]Both of you.
[26:00.09]You're gonna have to write it down.
[26:01.43]So he already lost.
[26:03.72]I'm the oldest person here.
[26:04.72]How old are you? 28.
[26:08.46]Oh, wow.
[26:08.94]You're pushing 30?
[26:10.44]37.
[26:11.12]Wow.
[26:12.07]Don't say it like that.
[26:12.93]Wow.
[26:13.95]Just general manner.
[26:14.73]You can't go, wow.
[26:15.63]Shit.
[26:16.29]Damn.
[26:18.27]Whoa.
[26:18.85]That's like elderly, man.
[26:20.45]I kind of feel bad.
[26:20.97]We're down to like a wheelchair ramp at the front now.
[26:23.99]I can still move.
[26:24.91]Yeah.
[26:25.17]Oh.
[26:25.81]Oh, okay.
[26:26.59]We'll do that in the third game.
[26:27.79]Oh, I will.
[26:28.81]Okay, he will.
[26:30.39]Hey, if I have to move, I'll move.
[26:31.37]Oh, yeah.
[26:31.61]Yes.
[26:32.14]And then we go to the next version.
[26:33.12]Next version is going to be...
[26:35.51]What is your partner's favorite fast food?
[26:38.73]So since you guys were chosen very, very specifically for your synergy with your teammate, you guys know this.
[26:44.44]They already wrote their answers.
[26:45.28]Look at them.
[26:45.86]Jesus.
[26:46.32]They're so fast.
[26:46.98]Shit.
[26:47.10]I don't know this.
[26:50.09]What is your partner's favorite?
[26:52.39]I feel like I should know this.
[26:54.63]Connor gives off BK energy.
[26:59.07]I saw your lips move, but I didn't.
[27:00.40]That's a roast.
[27:01.62]You call him 37 because he needs a wheelchair.
[27:04.24]BK, that's a low blow.
[27:05.66]Yeah, it is.
[27:07.04]Are the fries still good?
[27:08.72]Their chicken fries are decent.
[27:11.11]The chicken sandwich is the only good thing, and even then it's subpar.
[27:13.87]Austin only eats chicken.
[27:15.29]He literally only eats grilled chicken.
[27:16.59]Okay, then what do people that eat chicken go to?
[27:19.03]Chick-fil-A.
[27:20.06]He's gay.
[27:20.62]I already wrote it.
[27:23.61]Who would your partner choose to portray them in a movie?
[27:29.05]So your partner, who would they choose to portray them in a movie?
[27:32.65]It's like a hard question, but you got this.
[27:34.46]Don't wanna take your time, man.
[27:35.86]We have an entire day.
[27:37.62]Nobody's busy.
[27:38.46]Production is chill.
[27:39.94]Nobody has kids and shit like that.
[27:41.56]You're chilling.
[27:41.98]Who you thinking?
[27:42.40]Who you thinking?
[27:42.98]I don't know.
[27:43.74]Who would do your movie?
[27:45.37]They're back?
[27:45.89]What are you doing?
[27:46.81]Oh!
[27:47.11]Oh my God!
[27:48.39]No, no, no, no.
[27:49.55]It's fine.
[27:50.25]He's on the enemy team.
[27:51.77]He's chilling.
[27:52.77]Back up!
[27:53.69]How would you know what that's like?
[27:55.75]It's fine, it's fine.
[27:56.39]They're done.
[27:56.85]They're done.
[27:57.35]Bring him out.
[27:57.71]The answers are written down, locked in.
[28:00.01]Don't write anything.
[28:01.71]He tried to cheat again.
[28:02.69]This is so bad.
[28:03.73]What was your first gaming console?
[28:07.41]You're a gamer, right?
[28:08.79]Your first gaming console.

[29:05.01]I constantly had a UAV on my head.
[29:07.35]It was fantastic.
[29:08.59]Nobody's seen a better gamer, folks.
[29:11.17]The answer was wrong.
[29:12.17]He's gotten many nukes.
[29:13.37]What was your first gaming console?
[29:17.53]Wait, hold on.
[29:18.88]Bruce?

[29:21.65]Oh, man, this guy.
[29:22.13]Did he answer to you?
[29:23.37]Dude, I tailored the question just for Jerma.
[29:28.08]There's no way you could fail it.
[29:29.32]There's no way you could do it.
[29:30.70]I mean, it might be worth it.
[29:32.36]Do you need to rewrite your answers?
[29:33.85]No, I'm not going to say what he wrote.
[29:35.79]Okay.
[29:37.17]Not what he meditated.
[29:38.43]What he...
[29:40.13]You son of a bitch.
[29:41.29]Hey, hey, wait.
[29:42.89]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[29:44.28]Wait, that's allowed.
[29:45.56]No, no, no, it's allowed, it's allowed.
[29:47.42]That's not disallowed.
[29:48.50]I don't know if I know, though.
[29:50.02]He's so crafty.
[29:51.12]It's allowed.
[29:52.00]You know what, you got to appreciate the art.
[29:53.32]But now you have to give me the answer.
[29:54.24]I was just going to answer mine.
[29:58.34]But then he cheated.
[29:59.92]But it could be.

[30:10.38]I answered it like it was mine.
[30:11.48]What's an NES?
[30:13.08]I'm just testing you guys.

[30:50.73]Don't you fucking dare.
[30:52.37]Do not talk to him.
[30:53.43]Just give us the answer.
[30:55.52]McDonald's.
[30:57.37]Flip it.
[30:57.69]McDonald's.
[31:00.27]Oh, that's a point.
[31:02.37]That's a point.
[31:03.51]I've actually answered that this is yours.
[31:06.53]Oh, okay.
[31:06.85]You've mentioned your McDonald's order before.
[31:08.39]I have, but I actually thought I was writing it as if it was you.
[31:11.17]But why did the first one, did you do you?
[31:12.43]Because I'm a fucking moron.
[31:13.65]Okay.
[31:14.45]Who would you choose to portray you in a movie?
[31:19.50]Oh, okay.
[31:20.90]Come on.
[31:21.28]Recently, I have discovered that there are people that impersonate me, and the person who started it is Myth.
[31:28.72]Flip your hands over.
[31:29.50]Look, Myth does have an incredible .
[31:35.20]What's his name?
[31:35.68]What actor was portrayed in a movie of big fucking myth?
[31:38.28]What's his name?
[31:38.92]Wait, don't!
[31:39.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop!
[31:41.73]An actor or a Twitch streamer?
[31:44.89]No, no, no, you don't get to fucking do that.
[31:47.21]You do not.
[31:48.11]Baker Mayfield.
[31:49.41]No.
[31:49.55]Wow!
[31:49.83]Double wrong!
[31:51.95]Wait, hold on.
[31:54.35]Double, you know what?
[31:55.41]Fuck it.
[31:55.91]Just go for the third one.
[31:57.33]Third one, just go ahead.
[31:58.05]Third one is, who's the guy from You?
[31:59.77]You know what?
[32:01.01]Fuck it.
[32:01.47]Fuck it.
[32:02.03]Five tries.
[32:02.63]Just do it for five.
[32:03.57]Five tries.
[32:04.91]The guy from you, like the guy from Gossip Girl?
[32:06.79]You done?
[32:07.25]You done?
[32:07.83]Is that the guy?
[32:08.31]Just his answer.
[32:09.53]Fuck it, I don't know.
[32:10.47]Okay, he doesn't know.
[32:11.39]I put down Oscar Isaacson.
[32:13.04]I don't even know who that is.
[32:14.06]Are you kidding me?
[32:15.34]I don't even know who that is.
[32:16.28]He has a phenomenal pedigree.
[32:17.86]Who would portray me in a movie?
[32:19.26]Yes.
[32:19.86]Yes, thank you.
[32:20.72]Who would you choose to portray you in a movie?
[32:23.10]Who would I choose?
[32:24.82]Yeah.
[32:27.85]Well, you know, it'd be nice if, like, Leonardo DiCaprio would, like, beat me.
[32:31.09]Shit!
[32:32.53]Okay.
[32:33.83]But I don't know if, like, that would be, like, the right thing to do.
[32:36.11]Hold on, hold on.
[32:36.91]I'm not quite sure if that's a good thing.
[32:38.15]You can't guess your answer by being, like, Jim Carrey would be cool.
[32:42.12]Jim Carrey would be cool.
[32:45.10]Okay.
[32:45.36]Yeah, he wrote that for sure.
[32:47.36]I was going to write that.
[32:49.95]Tell him first.
[32:50.63]I was going to write Leonard, but then I wrote Matt Damon.
[32:53.57]I don't know.
[32:55.17]I changed my answer.
[32:56.19]Matt Damon would definitely portray me better.
[32:57.63]Yeah, that's a point.
[32:58.91]Wait.
[32:59.71]Yeah.
[33:00.47]No, it's not.
[33:01.33]Wait, if it is a point, I think we still win.
[33:03.40]Yes.
[33:04.76]Hey, come on!
[33:09.12]Welcome back to the final challenge of Juiced, episode two.
[33:14.35]Now, basically, everybody knows what's happening.
[33:16.59]You guys know what's happening.
[33:18.03]Yep.
[33:18.11]You have to pop your balloons on there, your balloons on there while he's jumping.
[33:22.81]You get it?
[33:24.05]Yep.
[33:24.67]Okay, production, give me a timer.
[33:26.91]Five, four, three, two, one, start it.
[33:31.26]Go, come on.
[33:32.67]Okay, they have about 30 sec- 30 balloons each.
[33:37.78]This is not how this is gonna be played.
[33:42.88]Jesus!
[33:44.12]Oh no, don't!
[33:46.72]Stop!
[33:47.12]Remember, you have to pop- you have to pop your own balloons!
[33:52.06]Not block his!
[33:54.58]Oh shit!
[34:04.55]Shit, no!
[34:05.49]That was so bad.
[34:10.80]Just be aggressive.
[34:11.78]He's playing aggressive, just go.
[34:12.54]What?
[34:12.74]Wait, we didn't slide, we didn't send a wave over here.
[34:16.30]I'm gonna get fat left from that one.
[34:17.96]We didn't send a wave.
[34:19.20]Did I get you, I'm sorry.
[34:20.22]Run the teeth.
[34:21.62]I'm just gonna be in there, I'm not gonna hang out with you.
[34:29.09]50 seconds to go.
[34:29.51]Okay, time's up.
[34:31.01]50 seconds to go.
[34:31.45]God damn it.
[34:31.81]You have to pop your own balloons now.
[34:33.33]Austin!
[34:33.49]Pop a fucking balloon!
[34:34.11]Good job, Jerma.
[34:34.67]Good job, Austin.
[34:35.03]What the fuck?
[34:35.43]What?
[34:35.61]That makes no sense.
[34:36.35]Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
[35:02.29]Tremor, if you win, you go to Fabrica.
[35:03.95]He lost his spikes.
[35:07.81]Watch your feet, watch your feet.
[35:10.69]Give me a balloon!
[35:12.05]Get a balloon!
[35:14.49]On my head!
[35:16.93]On my head!
[35:18.11]What are you doing?
[35:20.87]What are you rolling?
[35:23.49]Hey, hey, hey!
[35:23.97]Get up.
[35:24.29]Go, go, go, get it up.
[35:26.25]What the fuck are you doing here?
[35:28.87]Off!
[35:30.09]Jesus Christ!
[35:34.78]Gemma, do something!
[35:42.74]Come on, get out of here!
[35:46.16]Come on!
[35:46.47]Come on, Gemma!
[35:47.59]40 seconds to go!
[35:50.37]What the fuck?
[35:51.89]They're just cheating!
[35:54.65]I got you!
[35:55.75]I'm behind you.
[35:56.89]Three seconds, three seconds.
[36:01.39]Three seconds.
[36:03.98]This is rude.
[36:06.92]Oh, fuck!
[36:07.48]Jerma, stop pretending like it's like... Just pass them.
[36:16.69]There's no more!
[36:22.58]Yeah.
[36:24.84]Four, three, two, one.
[36:28.90]Stop it.
[36:29.68]Alright, we got it.
[36:31.18]No, no, you don't got it.
[36:32.94]What do you mean?
[36:33.54]Let's go.
[36:34.28]So now since we did it that way, what we're going to do is we're going to count the balloons backwards and we're going to subtract from the number we had earlier, which will give us the number that you popped by not cheating, which is pretty much fucking zero.
[36:45.55]I think we won.
[36:47.07]Yeah, you told me earlier, rig it, make it a tie, so we could do the tie break.
[36:51.49]That's what production just said.
[36:53.19]You said it when we were doing the game, remember?
[36:54.79]So I did a tie, and I did the tortilla thing.
[36:57.10]Yep, I did that.
[36:58.72]Holy!
[36:59.92]That's a tie!
[37:01.65]What are we going to do?
[37:03.38]So we won?
[37:03.92]Wait, that doesn't mean they get a two score.
[37:08.18]We get three.
[37:08.72]They get three two scores.
[37:10.95]That's right.
[37:12.33]One player from each team.
[37:14.89]For what?
[37:15.61]Just say it one more time, man.
[37:17.65]Give them the three two scores.
[37:20.73]That was fun.
[37:23.09]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[37:24.65]Don't fight.
[37:27.95]Wait, they're going.
[37:28.53]Yeah, they're going.
[37:29.03]Let them go.
[37:31.87]I'm out of breath.
[37:33.29]Are you out of breath or is it just me?
[37:35.19]Oh, no, I am.
[37:35.71]Okay, good.
[37:36.55]Honestly, the helmet was really small for my head.
[37:39.00]What is this?
[37:40.50]That's for you.
[37:41.28]Oh, thank you.
[37:42.32]That's for you.
[37:44.06]We're taking a small break so you guys can eat food and drink water.
