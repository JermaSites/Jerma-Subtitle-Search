[03:02.28]Wake up.
[03:06.01]Oh, I turned off... You're probably wondering, what's with the VHS stuff?
[03:08.66]I turned off the VHS filter.

[03:13.04]Do you know you can pick...
[03:16.00]Wait, I want to read that.
[03:18.35]Do you know that you can pick... You can hold down E to pick up coins easier.
[03:22.35]Oh, that's good to know.
[03:24.22]Should I just get rid of this?
[03:32.08]Does he pick up coins too?
[03:34.84]You need to play Roblox Tycoon.
[03:37.29]I'm not playing Roblox.
[03:40.01]This is for adults, okay?
[03:44.17]What I'm doing is for adults.
[03:49.28]Goldberry?
[03:50.72]Oh shit.
[03:58.48]He's a grown man.
[03:59.58]Yeah, guess what?
[04:00.81]Are you trying to tell me that all the old people don't play games like this on their phones?
[04:04.35]Are you crazy?
[04:07.94]You know how many visits to the Geek Squad that has to happen because of all the old people that download the fucking virus games?
[04:15.42]Are you out of your mind?
[04:20.04]Okay, there's more bear.
[04:21.75]Okay, these are more buddies.
[04:25.50]Create star orbs.
[04:27.91]I want more.
[04:28.67]Oh, I need one more dollar.
[04:33.95]Okay, fine.
[04:34.61]I'll do that one.
[04:39.23]You're gonna play Resident Evil 9 on Day 1?
[04:40.80]Oh, I'm playing it on Day 0.
[04:45.03]When that unlocks, I'm gonna be here with an extra large coffee.
[04:51.63]I can actually hurt him.
[04:52.31]I didn't mean to.
[04:54.12]Put it in!
[04:54.58]What'd you do?
[04:55.21]You're not even doing it right.
[04:59.47]Can I sell him?
[05:01.62]No, he can't go in.
[05:06.63]Press E to pick up berries and objects.
[05:09.20]Every berry put down the hole has a chance to spawn a star orb.
[05:11.92]Shatter them to collect their power.
[05:13.72]Check Sunny's sunbeams for the remaining... Oh, okay.
[05:16.56]Got it.
[05:25.03]Give me that.
[05:26.53]You're doing it so wrong, it's just annoying.
[05:28.54]I gotta, okay, I gotta rebind that.
[05:32.19]I want that to be like mouse, a mouse button.
[05:37.16]The hole grows larger, you're doing great.
[05:48.11]Whoa, that's a...
[05:49.80]Okay.
[05:50.87]Throw, drop, jump, sprint.
[05:54.65]You can move the whole air blast.
[05:57.31]I want I want pick up.
[06:02.03]OK, pick up.
[06:02.65]I want this to be that.
[06:05.10]Yeah.
[06:09.75]I still have $14.
[06:11.27]The fuck?
[06:16.00]Your FOV is 60?
[06:17.10]That's got to change.
[06:20.33]Oh.
[06:24.18]Let's do 80.
[06:26.47]That is better.
[06:28.95]Alright, maybe if I just throw them all over there, he can pick them up.
[06:31.92]Or I have to catch it in the air.
[06:33.55]Oh, dude, did you see that?
[06:34.96]Hey, dude, did you see that?
[06:38.52]Star orb!
[06:41.34]What is it?
[06:41.64]What did it do?
[06:53.47]Get in there.
[06:59.88]Turn it up?
[07:00.87]Turn it down?
[07:01.51]Wait, I'm getting conflicting messages from you guys.
[07:08.45]Turn the volume up or turn the volume down?
[07:16.99]I feel like I'm on double dare right now.
[07:24.77]Oh my god, I fell down.
[07:26.08]What did...
[07:27.01]Okay, I fell and you lose money.
[07:31.05]That's really good to know.
[07:32.22]I had to do it once.
[07:33.89]Um, alright.
[07:35.04]How about a vacuum?
[07:40.75]I want another buddy.
[07:43.44]How do you lose in Berry, Berry, Berry?
[07:46.03]It's a game!
[07:46.94]All games can be lost, okay?
[07:50.30]You can lose any game.
[07:51.85]I see that sometimes, like, how do you lose?
[07:55.53]And every game has a lose condition.
[08:01.48]Oops, I'm sorry.
[08:06.44]What the fuck, dude?
[08:08.43]Just get up, get up.
[08:13.66]Alright, I can't just run around.
[08:15.40]Here's my plan.
[08:17.75]Here's the strategy.
[08:18.88]When we're down to 50% sun, I'm running over there and I'm going to dump them all.
[08:37.81]Oh.
[08:44.73]Alright, this game's sick.
[08:45.85]I'm going to be obsessed.
[08:47.28]Hey, sorry, Infinity Nikki.
[08:49.56]See you next week.
[08:50.77]I'm kidding.
[08:52.13]I'm gonna play it.
[08:52.87]I got...
[08:53.40]I installed it already.
[08:58.69]I'm gonna play this for one hour.
[09:02.09]And then after that hour, I will assess how I feel about everything.
[09:11.68]We're gonna get automation eventually here.
[09:13.34]It's gonna be great.
[09:16.42]Alright, 24 bucks.
[09:17.26]What do I want?
[09:19.35]Ah, I need a vacuum.
[09:28.53]Wait, can I have a different song on the radio?
[09:35.18]Okay, what does the star mean?
[09:37.61]Is it like times three multiplier or something?
[09:42.08]Oh my god, I'm fucking terrible at the Facebook game that the old people play!
[09:48.42]I gotta calm down.
[09:52.23]I was too busy looking at what the star did.
[09:53.97]Oh, that's nice.
[10:09.74]Bring it over here.
[10:17.05]Good.
[10:18.55]Give me that one.
[10:19.14]Nice job.
[10:23.03]This is going better than before.
[10:29.77]I wish I could pick up multiple things.
[10:37.25]Dude, I have to change the controls.
[10:40.94]I have to change the controls.
[10:43.43]Hold on.
[10:44.84]Left click needs to be picked up.
[10:49.57]Left click is going to be pick up, use, and vacuum.
[10:55.31]Throw is going to be this one.
[10:59.20]my brain keeps trying to thank you alright hold I need to read this
[11:06.66]Hold back to suck up berries of the vacuum.
[11:09.45]And fire.
[11:11.83]Can hold it down too.
[11:12.91]Can hold control to charge the vacuum blast.
[11:22.69]This game just got so much crazier.
[11:25.78]Alright, now dump them in.
[11:30.56]Can you suck up coins?
[11:32.21]Yep.
[11:49.98]Hell yeah.
[11:52.22]Don't go in the hole, please.
[11:58.77]Alright, I should have enough money to do something.
[12:01.21]Alright, 19.
[12:01.76]I want...
[12:04.93]I can upgrade Berry Buddies.
[12:06.02]No, we're just going to go full-time money.
[12:08.22]Full-time money making right now.
[12:12.39]Watch this.
[12:13.52]No more mistakes.
[12:14.06]Check it out.
[12:14.36]Ready?
[12:15.29]I'm going to get the trajectory perfect.
[12:30.46]Let's turn around.
[12:38.83]I gotta get the... right at the lip of the blue.
[12:42.43]Right above the lip.
[12:43.85]Right there.
[12:44.20]Got it.
[12:45.16]Alright.
[12:45.42]Locking into internal complete focused memory.
[12:48.19]Done.
[12:54.53]Completely internalized.
[12:57.19]Initiating sequence.
[13:04.21]Burnt into complete full-time memory.
[13:07.79]Sequence has been destroyed.
[13:25.37]You can use the stars.
[13:26.70]How do I use the stars?
[13:30.74]You missed two stars.
[13:31.55]I had to get that locked in.
[13:37.36]Well, then get the fuck out of the way!
[13:38.88]Get these- How do I delete these?
[13:43.61]Oh!
[14:07.31]I...
[14:07.83]He bumped me!
[14:09.21]Ugh, my fucking...
[14:17.48]He bumped me!
[14:18.39]Okay, I can upgrade the berry people?
[14:21.27]Throw the star wand at berry buddies to upgrade them at cost of star orbs.
[14:28.23]Get all this shit the fuck out of my... Alright, you can dump them.
[14:31.23]You can dump them.
[14:43.44]Alright, I'm going to upgrade them.
[14:48.17]Lock it in.
[14:51.57]Okay.
[14:52.44]Uh, you... Whoa.
[14:56.72]It's a boofda.
[15:00.70]Okay, I can only... Can I do it to you, too?
[15:03.55]Alright, I got two...
[15:05.18]I got a boofda and a yip.
[15:19.43]Okay, what happens if the money goes down the hole?
[15:20.94]Is that bad?
[15:23.72]They got names that... Whoa, there's a golden berry.
[15:30.30]Okay, let me take a look at what we got.
[15:35.10]Let me see what we got here.
[15:42.70]oh my god there's a prestige rewind at the beginning reset your money and upgrades retains your berry buddy star orbiting in 25
[15:51.38]Boys and girls, we're going to be here for a long time.
[16:02.50]125 is Sledgehammer.
[16:12.37]Okay, this one is unlock.
[16:13.58]Okay, I'll move the hole.
[16:14.57]I'm going to do that one.
[16:16.00]I need 50 bucks.
[16:30.10]Come here.
[16:32.05]Got it.
[16:32.21]Look at these.
[16:32.51]These are going to be worth so much money.
[16:33.86]Look at that.
[16:34.48]What's that worth?
[16:36.59]Oh!
[16:38.56]Three pennies.
[16:44.94]I gotta increase capacity of the vacuum, right?
[16:51.85]I was almost blinded by greed and went right in the hole.
[17:12.34]That's a pretty good day.
[17:22.96]34 bucks?
[17:25.06]Alright, now I can do, I can move the hole now.
[17:30.97]Do we, I, look at this, watch this shit.
[17:33.29]We move the hole right into the trajectory of where it pops out of the flower.
[17:38.74]Press Q to set a destination for the hole to move to.
[17:50.83]What the hell?
[17:51.42]What are you doing?
[17:51.90]Move!
[17:52.21]I might have to break the rocks.
[18:00.30]Dude, I used all of my move juice?
[18:02.98]I wasted it?
[18:03.71]What are you talking about, wasted it?
[18:09.57]What do you mean move juice?
[18:11.13]I didn't do anything.
[18:21.07]Holy fuck, I don't know what that was, but it was a lot.
[18:28.38]Okay, I can slowly move with...
[18:30.53]Does it cost money?
[18:36.72]Okay, well that was a fucked up day.
[18:48.48]Let's go for that.
[18:52.52]Blackberry is yay or nay?
[18:53.73]Absolutely yay.
[18:55.31]The issue with the blackberry is you get a blackberry sometimes that the seeds are so strong that it actually feels like you're chewing on
[19:02.86]A piece of glass or something.
[19:08.60]Or a popcorn kernel that hasn't been popped.
[19:10.34]It's awful.
[19:21.93]But flavor-wise, Blackberry is up at S. It's one of the best.
[19:39.71]Alright, let's move it even closer.
[19:40.90]Does it stay for the whole day or is it just for this evening?
[19:46.43]You know what I'm saying?
[19:50.09]Oh, I get it.
[19:50.81]You can decide where you want it to go.
[19:52.74]Ah, I get it, I get it.
[19:55.67]You can keep it there.
[19:58.10]Alright, keep going.
[20:01.08]You have the diet of a pet lizard.
[20:03.93]I said I liked blackberries.
[20:06.18]So apparently that means to some of you that that's the only food that I eat.
[20:09.73]I don't eat anything else.
[20:10.47]I only just eat handfuls of blackberries.
[20:12.38]That's it.
[20:12.64]I don't do anything else.
[20:21.87]Yeah, I eat crickets too.
[20:25.79]And grapes.
[20:34.89]Do I even have to upgrade again?
[20:37.37]Let me try it.
[20:41.33]Nope.
[20:44.12]I wish they would collect the money.
[20:45.21]That's gonna be worth a lot.
[21:01.78]I can't lie.
[21:02.84]Actually, I love this game.
[21:03.89]This game is great.
[21:05.03]This is a fun time.
[21:06.04]I like it a lot.
[21:10.43]Alright, 125, I need 150.
[21:12.82]Or, let's get a sledgehammer.
[21:17.09]I can destroy walls?
[21:22.40]Please use responsibly.
[21:23.94]Do not throw.
[21:24.96]Oh, hello.
[21:33.60]What's going on here?
[21:40.71]We just opened up a whole new area.
[21:47.14]Should I not do this?
[21:49.63]I can't see a reason why not to do this.
[21:55.77]Can I go even further?
[21:58.83]What is that?
[22:04.08]Oh, this is going to get so... Oh, goodness.
[22:06.69]Alright.
[22:07.18]Hurry up.
[22:08.04]Try to waste the whole day.
[22:09.19]That's fine.
[22:18.76]What is behind here?
[22:22.04]Oh wait, there's goofy shit in this game.
[22:26.66]There's a goofy computer in this game, and there's passwords and...
[22:33.83]This is a game with that goofy shit in it.
[22:36.13]Is this censored?
[22:37.27]Why is it all censored?
[22:47.60]I didn't make any money.
[22:54.50]Alright, let's take this opportunity to one more day.
[22:59.44]I got to clear this.
[23:01.98]Can I clear that?
[23:04.05]No.
[23:04.39]It probably needs to be stronger to do the rest of this.
[23:07.47]Let me get the area out.
[23:18.63]Dude, G-O-T-Y.
[23:21.37]G-O-T-Y.
[23:49.55]Alright, this will be a... Can I destroy the rocks?
[23:51.80]Wait, this is funny stuff.
[23:53.16]Oh, I want days to last longer.
[23:54.51]I probably can make the sun stay up longer.
[24:00.23]The way you use that hole is painful.
[24:03.07]Dude, um... Give me a fucking second.
[24:13.71]I'm just trying to clear everything.
[24:19.42]Alright, I don't think that... That's all the walls that can be destroyed.
[24:28.81]Can I pick this up?
[24:34.08]Hey, there's plenty of time to make money, okay?
[24:43.21]That needs to be bigger, it does.
[24:44.59]Alright, let's make some money.
[24:54.41]I did that on purpose just to...
[24:56.08]I don't want that guy to get mad at me.
[25:04.37]Alright, I think I can upgrade somebody.
[25:05.52]No, really?
[25:19.61]You got to make that faster, right?
[25:20.92]There's got to be a way to make that shootout faster.
[25:22.54]I guarantee it.
[25:35.05]Infinity Nikki hype.
[25:37.26]Get hype!
[25:41.27]Ooh!
[25:43.94]Hold on.

[25:49.15]Now I have the ability to have strawberries.
[26:07.47]Alright, what am I looking for next?
[26:11.23]Probably another one of these.
[26:18.15]Uh, I like that, but hold on.
[26:21.00]I told you there was going to be a make the day longer.
[26:22.85]I'm doing that.
[26:23.31]250.
[26:35.19]strawberry incoming oh my god it's probably gonna look at how big and juicy that strawberry is guys oh imagine if you dipped it in chocolate
[26:58.97]you

[27:18.61]They really ain't much better than a fresh strawberry that is ripe.
[27:23.61]It's pretty.
[27:24.65]I know it's like the meme fruit that everybody...
[27:26.91]The hole grows larger.
[27:28.50]You're doing great.
[27:32.25]But if you get a juicy ass strawberry and it's bright red, you know what I'm talking about?
[27:36.91]It's syrupy.
[27:38.09]It's like it's syrupy.
[27:39.94]You know what I'm saying?
[27:46.84]Oh my goodness, it's great.

[27:58.89]So the hole's bigger now?
[28:03.76]Doesn't look like it.
[28:07.01]Will you guys stop fucking around over here and give me stuff?
[28:32.20]Or even grow that.

[29:10.75]Yes, what?
[29:18.17]Collect the coins only at night.
[29:20.18]Um, if they go down the hole, don't they disappear?
[29:21.94]Or do I collect them technically if they go down?
[29:36.41]Coins will not go down the hole.
[29:40.98]Oh.
[29:42.57]You're about to get timed out for 30 seconds.
[29:49.84]Give me that.
[30:02.15]Please, boy!
[30:04.10]Oh, please!
[30:05.28]No!
[30:17.44]Satisfying to pick these up though.
[30:27.81]Think I got them all.
[30:33.22]These look like little candies.
[30:38.26]Oh, 150.
[30:39.77]How about that whole movement range?
[30:45.09]I don't need to get every coin.
[30:59.61]Okay, I can upgrade that guy, alright?
[31:01.86]Little blueberry one.
[31:06.84]Excellent.
[31:14.12]What are you doing stuck back here?
[31:16.23]Come join us.
[31:20.02]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[31:22.53]I'm so mad at myself.
[31:46.37]Ehhh.
[31:55.78]Eventually this is going to be full.
[31:57.63]It's going to be awesome.
[32:04.15]This is a big day, almost 100, more than 100?
[32:08.88]Move hole under prop at the same time.
[32:11.01]He'll see it.
[32:12.67]I mean, I can only move it so much.
[32:18.09]I'm trying to get it so that things just pop right into it.
[32:30.63]The gnome is doing...
[32:32.60]I just almost read that.
[32:34.73]No, it's not.
[32:38.60]What are you talking about?
[32:53.68]Duuude, look at that!
[33:03.01]He finally did it.
[33:04.09]It's been like four days.
[33:13.44]Okay, I can see if it's been like four hours and I have not done that.
[33:19.03]God, instant gratification.
[33:20.65]They want instant gratification.
[33:45.91]Dude, that was pretty cool.
[33:47.52]He's tired of us.
[33:55.14]I mean...
[33:57.35]I mean...
[33:59.36]He didn't... Berry Bros, he didn't say no!
[34:02.99]Berry Bros, uh, rise up!
[34:20.54]Now he's just mocking us.
[34:24.94]I am not.
[34:30.26]Drew Crew attack.
[34:32.06]Oh, what?
[34:32.93]Dude, did you see that the Berry Bros have aligned and allied with the Drew Crew?
[34:37.31]This is a crazy development.
[34:42.02]Yeah, so your army of four people will join an army of 12 people.
[34:46.66]Oh no, whatever will I do?
[35:06.71]You know, I wonder... What a...
[35:12.97]If I were to do a poll, what faction do most of you adhere to?
[35:21.19]You know what I'm saying?
[35:23.25]There's been a lot of them over the years.
[35:24.74]There's been a dozen of this stupid shit that this community
[35:30.23]Oh, how did I miss that?
[35:42.06]What do you think the lowest faction is?
[35:47.69]Realistically.
[35:50.73]I think it probably actually is.
[35:54.72]I don't know.
[35:56.45]What are some of them?
[35:58.24]The Drakpak?
[36:00.29]The Dru-Crew?
[36:02.70]The Banana Bros?
[36:05.07]The Berry Bros, but that's a new one.
[36:06.67]That's a new one.
[36:10.21]Uh, the Sorcery Council?
[36:15.57]The wink dinks?
[36:18.00]I don't think we've ever said that.
[36:20.55]You're thinking of somebody else's stream.
[36:22.57]You guys have never been the wink dinks.
[36:33.73]The Flatliners?
[36:38.95]Who's flatlining?
[36:40.50]We've never said that before.
[36:47.89]The flat earthers.
[36:49.39]Alright, do you think there are more flat earthers in the chat or...
[36:57.73]Drew Crew.
[37:09.13]The Flatliners were during the Grillmaster era.
[37:12.13]Oh my god, wow.
[37:13.05]I don't even know my own channel lore.
[37:29.01]I can also do this too, can't I?
[37:34.60]How do I do the super blast?
[37:38.89]What's that?
[37:40.12]What does that actually do for me?
[37:49.77]You used to have Channel Point wink redemptions, remember?
[37:52.16]And then in an Isaac stream, people asked you to wink and you didn't do it.
[37:56.22]And the whole chat went silent in protest and in annoyance, you called everyone wink dinks.
[38:04.47]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[38:09.43]Oh wait, and then didn't I...
[38:11.10]Okay, it's coming back to me.
[38:14.03]At one point, I didn't do them for a week or two straight.
[38:17.88]Because I just didn't feel like it and it was annoying to me.
[38:20.96]So I had to redeem them all at the same time.
[38:23.05]And didn't I do like 500 in a row?
[38:25.01]Or 1,000 winks in a row or something weird?
[38:38.76]It was a thousand.
[38:41.18]Alright, hold on.
[38:41.58]We got new fruit coming up.
[38:49.05]Oh my god, dude.
[38:50.72]Can you please...
[38:56.81]I'll take double strawberry.
[38:58.49]That sounds good to me.
[39:06.67]Alright, I gotta focus on making money.
[39:15.88]I gotta make I gotta focus on making money.
[39:17.41]Hold on.
[39:23.22]This is the reunion scene in season callback Andy.
[39:29.80]When have I talked about the banana bros?
[39:36.12]Yeah, sometimes we remember stuff that we did.
[39:39.91]Sometimes.
[39:43.09]Alright, this is, today's gonna be a purely money making day, that's it.
[39:53.06]starting right now.
[40:08.62]Get over here.
[40:14.79]Give me a golden berry.
[40:15.90]I haven't had a golden berry in it feels like a hundred years.
[40:31.33]Who is not upgraded?
[40:36.75]This guy's just in here pooping all over the walls.
[40:38.47]Like, come on, man.
[40:39.80]You gotta get out of here.
[40:49.61]That's gonna be crazy Get in there, please!
[41:01.06]Oh!
[41:05.48]Wah-ha!
[41:12.89]You need to eat the props.
[41:14.64]I have been.
[41:15.09]I need to make some cash first.
[41:22.29]Hey, your whimsy makes me sick.
[41:26.30]What does that mean?
[41:35.02]Whimsy?
[41:36.14]I wouldn't classify.
[41:38.71]I wouldn't call myself whimsical.
[41:43.88]No, dude, I don't turn the webcam on and there's a bowtie that spins around.
[41:47.17]I don't, that's not me.
[41:49.56]That's not me.
[41:51.50]But I mean, that kind of sounds pretty fucking dope.
[42:03.76]It's a serious tie.
[42:05.33]Yeah.
[42:08.36]Yeah, okay, I'm thinking of objects to wear that I would not want to put on.
[42:11.82]A propeller hat is something I don't think I would ever want to wear.
[42:18.76]To me, the immaturity level of having a propeller hat on is just not...
[42:22.87]I can't.
[42:24.48]We do a lot of dumb shit here.
[42:26.36]I could not do that.
[42:27.20]I don't want to do that.
[42:29.57]To me, that's too far.
[42:31.99]I don't know why, but it is.
[42:34.69]Whoa.
[42:37.84]Yeah, clown makeup is fine.
[42:41.65]Uh, being in a full clown costume is totally fine to me.
[42:44.26]It's something about that propeller hat.
[42:47.39]that is just you know kind of like dumb guy like oh he's dumb he's he's a child you know what I mean no no I'm not putting that on
[43:04.30]You would show your dick on camera, but you wouldn't wear a hat?
[43:06.51]Yes.
[43:17.06]I think I would rather do that.
[43:25.08]Because you understand how that picture, how far that goes and how many edits of that happen and how it's just permanently there
[43:33.48]and you're like the oh you're like the funny guy with the with the you got the goofy little kid hat on
[43:38.81]It will never leave you.
[43:40.92]Ever.
[43:42.17]Well, I guess showing your dick on camera would also never leave you.
[43:45.85]But one of those two things is like...
[43:49.14]Alright, they both are bad.
[43:50.41]One of those never leaves you.
[43:58.94]You have sus PTSD?
[44:01.50]I've lived that, okay?
[44:02.92]I've gone through that.
[44:06.76]Whoa.
[44:07.80]Berry Blitz?
[44:16.87]Blitz ready.
[44:25.91]Press G to activate Bury Blitz.
[44:27.58]Hold on.
[44:29.36]We're blitzing right now.
[44:30.49]Holy shit, that is going crazy.
[44:35.78]Oh my God.
[44:37.45]That's so many.
[44:38.55]Blow them all in here.
[44:44.03]That's too much.
[45:02.58]Oh yeah.
[45:07.76]Yeah, I've had the goofy picture of your face show up everywhere.
[45:12.40]And in my mind, it's like, okay, so that happened.
[45:14.87]I know what it's like to live that life.
[45:17.99]Would it be worse...
[45:23.74]Okay, that was pretty crazy.
[45:30.15]Wow, look at all that.
[45:46.72]Of course it would be.
[45:47.61]I know.
[45:47.89]I'm fucking around.
[45:48.75]It would be a thousand times worse.
[45:52.72]Or, I don't know, maybe it wouldn't.
[46:07.87]Why is it moving around?
[46:08.89]Uh, this shit is moving towards me.
[46:29.40]So scary.
[46:31.72]Alright, 300 bucks.
[46:33.37]Let's go.
[46:41.35]That move is insane.
[46:45.73]There's more walls to destroy.
[46:47.24]That's unbelievable.
[46:53.31]I want that.
[46:54.06]500.
[46:54.63]I think that's a big deal.
[46:57.23]Let's go for it.
[47:05.08]With the dick picture, you know you can at least, you will never have a professional career ever again.
[47:08.80]You can just move to Costa Rica.
[47:13.26]How would that end, though?
[47:16.05]Well, yeah, guys.
[47:17.74]Yeah.
[47:19.09]Showed my dick on camera, so...
[47:21.31]Yeah, you know how it is.
[47:22.41]I'll see you guys in Mexico.
[47:25.24]See you in Costa Rica.
[47:30.38]Why do I have to...
[47:32.19]leave I don't have to like leave the United States what are you talking about do I have to leave the country
[47:42.32]In this hypothetical scenario, why am I fleeing the country?
[47:54.22]You'd be embarrassed about it?
[47:55.94]Yeah, I would be embarrassed about it in another country, too.
[47:59.01]That doesn't fix the problem.
[48:08.91]Exiled.
[48:16.19]What, I'm gonna show up to Costa Rica with a backpack and I'm gonna get greeted off the plane by everybody else that showed their dick on camera?
[48:23.44]Hey, Jerma!
[48:25.45]Oh, dude!
[48:26.32]Hey, welcome!
[48:27.18]Good to see- Hey, you did it too!
[48:28.37]Yeah!
[48:28.93]We all did!
[48:29.57]We have formed our own little community.
[48:47.73]Ha ha ha!
[48:54.02]No, I'm not.
[48:54.76]Whatever.
[48:55.08]Let's keep going.
[48:57.43]Ah, I want the auto pickup for...
[48:58.77]Wait, I need to do another day.
[49:03.91]Uh-oh.
[49:17.85]No, come back
[49:24.11]Alright, we're going Blitz Mode.
[49:25.72]Wait, I have to wait seven and a half minutes for Blitz Mode?
[49:33.49]Who's your favorite Look Outside character?
[49:35.24]That's spoilers.
[49:37.30]But, um...
[49:41.51]I would say it begins with the letter R.
[49:53.29]No, you guys are wrong.
[49:57.10]Although I do like that character a lot.
[49:58.95]Just go play it.
[50:00.03]Go play Game of the Year last year.
[50:09.79]No, sorry, Ronald McDonald is not in.
[50:12.67]Look outside.
[50:13.26]You know what's crazy?
[50:16.39]I almost just went to bed without picking up any money.
[50:18.30]But that's not the crazy part.
[50:19.32]What is crazy is I have not had McDonald's
[50:21.97]in more than a year.
[50:25.67]It's been 14 or 15 months since I've eaten at McDonald's.
[50:30.55]Isn't that crazy?
[50:34.39]Fast food just kind of, I don't, I don't, something about it.
[50:37.07]I got really sick last year.
[50:39.64]remember when I got wicked sick and I just kind of just doesn't do it I I like deleted all want of fast food like that for some reason
[50:55.17]McDonald's is gross now.
[50:57.70]Is McDonald's also like 40 bucks for two people to eat there?
[51:02.32]Or even more than that?
[51:11.62]McDonald's has got to seriously, they got to seriously fucking come up with some new shit here.
[51:17.03]It's supposed to be cheap, consistent, and available.
[51:21.09]cheap, consistent, available.
[51:25.24]They fucked up big time with the McCafe dog shit.
[51:27.75]You know what I'm saying?
[51:29.12]With the McCafe.
[51:30.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[51:31.99]The second that they started doing the McCafe shit, and made all their restaurants gray and beige, they fucked up.
[51:44.51]affordable, consistent, available.
[51:49.46]It's all anybody cared about.
[51:52.98]Yeah, is it good for you?
[51:54.17]No, but it doesn't have to be.
[51:57.00]It's just food that's quick and consistent.
[52:06.41]I upgraded... Why do you sound like you're on LinkedIn?
[52:11.32]No, I'm just...
[52:16.06]here's nothing why would you why this is coming from a McDonald's I am McDonald's fan I'm a big fan
[52:25.03]McDonald's, your last album was awful.
[52:28.21]And I've heard every album.
[52:31.08]I've listened to every album.
[52:32.73]I've been at every concert.
[52:34.05]The new album sucks.
[52:36.44]And the new album just doesn't suck.
[52:38.63]It is so, it is just so over the top, just like you tried to make it bad to lose all the fans.
[52:47.07]Come on.
[52:54.73]Alright, let me, today's a collect day.
[53:06.01]Ronald's gonna come after you?
[53:07.84]Ronald...
[53:09.31]I... Ronald and I go way back.
[53:11.27]Okay?
[53:12.76]I go way back with Ronald.
[53:17.68]huge parts of my life and huge periods of my existence.
[53:22.36]From my childhood to my adolescence to my adult life.
[53:26.43]McDonald's was there, okay?
[53:42.65]Wow.
[53:44.55]Look at that.
[53:54.23]I got berry blitz in four minutes.
[53:57.58]Why is this game actually awesome?
[53:59.63]This is amazing.
[54:00.71]I love this.
[54:07.02]But what I was going to say is,
[54:09.79]The fact that there are lots of places in your city right now, in your town.
[54:13.68]Unfortunately, not everybody has this luxury, but a lot of people do.
[54:19.10]that there's probably a place that does burgers or that does sandwiches or that does pizza or whatever that is right next to the McDonald's
[54:29.75]and is either the same price and better.
[54:33.95]That cannot happen in the McDonald's world.
[54:37.78]McDonald's has to be cheaper than everything and consistent.
[54:41.18]You don't go to McDonald's for the McCafe.
[54:43.93]God damn it, it makes me angry every time I say it.
[55:03.97]Oh, he's down.
[55:11.46]I gotta get this all the way.
[55:12.43]Look at that.
[55:12.89]Imagine sucking all that up.
[55:13.96]That's gonna be sick.
[55:17.23]Punch your desk.
[55:17.87]No, we're not gonna be angry about this.
[55:20.61]We're just gonna say it.
[55:24.10]Um...
[55:27.88]green holy sh whoa I almost said the s word that was a lot that was like 100
[55:37.35]What's wrong with me today?
[55:38.39]I haven't streamed in like a week.
[55:39.50]That's what's going on.
[55:41.31]I'm just unloading all the weird shit on you.
[55:44.74]What happens?
[55:45.67]It's alright.
[55:51.68]Oh.
[55:58.20]Get the blurry star?
[56:02.02]Wait, that's not just a placeholder.
[56:03.30]I can actually pick this up.
[56:06.78]I thought this was a... Oh, a star could be here, Mario, but you need to get the eight red coins.
[56:19.47]Put a star in it.
[56:20.43]Ooh, let me try that.
[56:26.81]Alright, what do I got?
[56:27.48]Let's do... That's pretty good.
[56:29.39]I'm going to save the money.
[56:35.01]Please play Mario Sunshine again.
[56:36.49]I'm going to be real with you.
[56:37.41]Mario Sunshine's not in the top 300.
[56:48.66]I don't think that did anything.
[57:01.54]Uh, let's go this way.
[57:02.49]We can pick up all these guys.
[57:04.73]Gonna be a ton of these stars.
[57:07.26]Oh, get in there.
[57:08.00]Yeah!
[57:12.29]What?
[57:22.38]There's a mod that makes it a 9 out of 10.
[57:24.47]I don't... That's fine.
[57:25.72]That's cool.
[57:26.20]But I don't...
[57:33.64]It's going to be a lot.
[57:35.97]How about grab these flamingos?
[57:48.86]Put berries here.
[57:49.74]Wait, okay.
[57:55.12]No!
[57:56.81]I just lost a hundred bucks.
[58:05.50]You could probably make a list of 300 Mario games that are better than Sunshine.
[58:09.65]I don't dislike Sunshine.
[58:10.75]I... What the hell is going on there?
[58:15.92]We need to investigate this What the hell?
[58:24.01]What did I do?
[58:24.57]What?
[58:25.73]How do I turn?
[58:26.21]How do I fix it?
[58:32.02]Did I fail?
[58:32.65]Is it a memory game?
[58:33.45]Maybe I have to do it tomorrow.
[58:36.00]Alright, IB.
[58:37.79]In the corner.
[58:44.46]I think Mario Sunshine is...
[58:50.99]A follow-up to... And this is why I don't...
[58:54.42]I give it the total benefit of the doubt.
[58:55.83]I don't say it's bad.
[58:56.71]I know people love it.
[58:58.46]I know it's a fun game.
[58:59.50]I enjoyed it.
[59:01.42]that had the sad kind of reality of having to release after what is arguably one of the most important video games
[59:11.41]of all time, right?
[59:13.30]Like, probably the most important video game of all, and what is the green one?
[59:19.95]I blew it.
[59:26.46]So imagine you're a game studio and you make a game and people all say, wow, that was amazing.
[59:32.78]And this is the turn of sort of a new era of this entertainment medium.
[59:36.45]And hey, not only was that like a really great thing, you were actually the turn of this whole thing and you essentially began like a whole new...
[59:46.04]era of what video games could probably even be.
[59:48.38]And it's still a great game and it's considered one of the best ever still.
[59:52.96]Oh, by the way, make another one now.
[59:54.85]The next one better be just as good.
[59:57.12]That came right after Mario 64.
[60:03.89]How long after Mario 64 did Sunshine come up?
[60:12.73]Five years?
[60:19.58]But it was the next main 3D Mario game that came out, right?
[60:25.00]Because of GameCube and... Was it a launch title for GameCube?
[60:27.69]I don't remember.
[60:35.28]Not quite.
[60:38.39]Okay, I can upgrade the berries.
[60:43.25]Just wait till I get some automation.
[60:44.31]It's gonna be awesome.
[60:48.15]Second, I can have these guys pick up stuff.
[60:54.67]How the fuck do you even do that?
[60:56.34]I don't even know how you even do that.
[60:57.67]I very clearly was... whatever.
[61:06.31]Vacuum capacity.
[61:07.61]I'm going to save the money.
[61:14.97]How are you bad at this game?
[61:15.77]You can be bad at anything.
[61:17.14]Again, again, again.
[61:19.37]Everyone likes to say, wow, you're bad at a kid's game.
[61:22.28]You can be bad at anything.
[61:30.16]How is it bad?
[61:33.15]I fell down the hole once in like an hour and 20 minutes gameplay wise.
[61:37.04]One time.
[61:37.55]You just got here.
[61:39.30]I happened to fall in the hole when you showed up to the stream.
[61:42.86]What the heck, man?
[61:44.22]It sucks that it happens to me.
[61:59.26]OK, I want to upgrade somebody.
[62:01.55]Let's get you done.
[62:03.48]Let's do you again.
[62:05.15]Let's get a couple of you done.
[62:06.55]In fact, you know what?
[62:10.88]Oh boy, that's a plum.
[62:22.27]Let's get this gnome.
[62:23.49]Sorry.
[62:29.94]You're way too high on THC-CVD to fly this.
[62:39.33]THC CBD.
[62:48.22]1200.
[62:48.82]I think I want the vacuum.
[62:55.85]Berry fountain.
[63:03.34]I'm doing a blitz today too.
[63:09.72]You got me into Super... Monster...
[63:12.17]Wait, that person has something cool to say.
[63:13.59]Let me see.
[63:14.94]You got me super into Monster Rancher and I just had a big tournament with my friends yesterday and it was incredible, thanks.
[63:20.53]It's a great game.
[63:23.03]This is a wonderful game.
[63:24.31]I'm glad that other people have enjoyed it.
[63:29.97]It's very enjoyable.
[63:32.44]Okay, so let me try this again.
[63:36.40]If I grab one of you...
[63:41.97]I don't know what that is, but it's not the one we're looking for.
[63:53.78]I saw a blue coin.
[63:57.54]Blue coins worth what?
[64:00.01]Oh, yes.
[64:02.32]Yes.
[64:10.33]Yes.
[64:13.16]Yes!
[64:20.66]So I've got to chill out.
[64:22.71]Sorry.
[64:35.44]There's so much more stuff to collect.
[64:40.59]Uh, give me this.
[64:42.20]I can hold 12 in there now.
[64:43.64]And then, where's the pickup range maybe?
[64:49.82]When are you gonna do Casino Inc?
[64:51.61]If you were not here the last stream, I'm getting a ton of solutions to play old games.
[64:56.77]I had a lot of problems trying to get both that and the movies to run.
[65:01.90]I've seen a lot of suggestions.
[65:03.13]I've seen a lot of stuff.
[65:04.43]You know, DX Wind, DG Voodoo.
[65:07.17]You also gotta, you have to run it on this mode.
[65:09.42]You have to do this in virtual machine.
[65:10.99]Get an old Windows XP laptop or...
[65:14.76]uh I'm gonna just have a permanent solution so if I ever actually want to play an old game that's not on GOG and I have the discs for it
[65:24.45]there will be a permanent solution for it.
[65:27.34]So unfortunately that means I'm going to miss the January 31st deadline.
[65:31.84]But once it's here, it's going to be perfect.
[65:38.47]There are a lot of games that released between, let's call it 1999 and 2008.
[65:45.96]that sit in this weird world where they're just so annoying to get to run on anything.
[65:54.20]And I usually...
[65:55.16]I had DX Wind.
[65:56.99]And that helped before, but...
[65:59.14]It doesn't work anymore on Windows 11.
[66:00.55]Like, the program works.
[66:02.63]But...
[66:03.73]I played Casino Inc. on a Windows 10 computer and I'm on a Windows 11 computer now and it just is a total disaster.
[66:10.39]I can't get it to work.
[66:12.47]It works weirdly.
[66:13.98]And I have to try like a thousand other things to get it to work.
[66:15.89]So I'm just going to run it natively on a different computer, I think.
[66:19.05]That's the idea.
[66:23.98]Alright, we're going for a berry blitz right now.
[66:28.03]Casino Inc. runs fine on Windows 11?
[66:29.52]What are you talking about?
[66:30.28]I...
[66:31.67]I don't know how you did that, but...
[66:34.78]Uh...
[66:36.40]There's like one guy that's making patches for it in a Steam discussion for that game.
[66:49.89]Alright.
[66:50.63]We're going to do Blitz next.
[66:51.51]Blitz next time.
[66:59.74]the the game opens and it runs like you can open casino I can open casino inc right now the problem is
[67:07.82]the game runs at a really odd resolution where it kind of makes alt tabbing really really hard
[67:14.41]And also every animation in the game is broken.
[67:17.68]Characters just kind of slide around.
[67:20.56]Nobody actually has any animations.
[67:22.59]It looks kind of shitty.
[67:33.76]And a couple of the solutions that I've tried already have not really worked.
[67:46.25]And the same kind of thing happened with the movies where it's like, oh, you have to do this, you have to get this, you have to get that.
[67:51.65]And I'm just gonna natively run them.
[67:54.63]And not have to worry about getting...
[67:56.83]you know, third, third, third party patches to try to fix a game and then it ends up not working right and...
[68:02.53]Or deal with the bullshit of having a virtual machine, which I've done that before and I hated it.
[68:08.87]So we're going native.
[68:10.24]We're going native operating system.
[68:16.18]Blitz!
[68:35.20]Now is there some magic to get it to actually run fine?
[68:38.83]I did it on Windows 10.
[68:41.62]I remember having to do a lot of weird bullshit.
[68:43.19]It's just that same weird bullshit that usually worked did not work for me on 11.
[68:48.45]I played it, what, like four, five years ago?
[68:50.53]When was that, Xenowing Extreme?
[68:52.83]Five years ago, right?
[69:02.34]56, yeah.
[69:11.08]Look at all this money.
[69:20.88]Alright, that's a shitload.
[69:24.78]It's alright.
[69:25.33]I didn't get it all, but whatever.
[69:26.39]It's a lot.
[69:32.38]I have DX Wind and DG Voodoo and it works.
[69:38.30]Maybe I'll try like an older version because DX Wind wouldn't open it.
[69:42.74]DX Wind, what it would do is it would make it like it would just crash the game.
[69:46.82]And I used DX Wind before.
[69:49.19]I've used DX Wind many times for lots of different games.
[69:52.46]Just Casino Inc. did not like it.
[69:54.23]Actually, let me tell you for real.
[69:56.47]I don't know if it's like the newer version of DX Wind or whatever, but it was kind of hard to have it work on anything.
[70:07.14]I tried to get Nancy Drew to work with DX Wind a couple weeks ago and it didn't work.
[70:12.04]Maybe I should get like an older version of it.
[70:17.08]But TL;DR is more than just opening it on Steam, unfortunately.
[70:25.72]But we're going to do it.
[70:28.75]I'm excited for it.
[70:34.05]Holy shit.
[70:35.38]30 times growth.
[70:38.47]Somebody on your subreddit has a PC they want to give you.
[70:44.57]Yeah.
[70:45.59]Here's the thing.
[70:46.87]I really do appreciate the fact that people want to help, but I also don't, I don't want to just take a random person's computer.
[70:54.54]Okay.
[71:01.14]If it gets to a point where I say, fuck, I actually might need to tap in here and...
[71:06.73]I really do appreciate it, though.
[71:09.04]And I know that there's probably some of you guys that are screaming at the mountaintops going, man, I have a perfect computer that he could just take.
[71:16.84]And it's ready.
[71:18.56]It's set.
[71:19.03]But we'll cross that bridge if we have to.
[71:22.60]I'm going to try doing my own way with my own setup.
[71:27.87]And, oh, trust me, there will be a stream, you'll hear me go, here's what I don't understand about Windows XP.
[71:33.60]Why did they decide on Service Pack 2?
[71:37.74]If that stream happens, which is very, very likely, right?
[71:43.21]Then we'll go down that road.
[71:58.80]Stealing Poke's voice.
[72:01.91]Did I do...
[72:03.74]No, that... No, that's more... No, no, no.
[72:07.36]I can't do the Pokémon.
[72:08.88]What's the Pokémon?
[72:09.46]It's... How does it go?
[72:11.37]Excuse me?
[72:13.08]I don't think so.
[72:14.56]I think this one's a little different.
[72:15.58]This one is like a... To me, I see an older man
[72:20.72]who's just a little fed up with the world right now, and he wants to tell you about it.
[72:34.93]Alright, give me a...
[72:35.54]I gotta go to the memory game.
[72:43.59]Is it top right?
[72:45.45]I think it's top right.
[72:50.23]Ooh, okay, so it's these two?
[72:58.15]Shit.
[72:58.57]Okay, well that's I, that's B.
[73:00.27]So it's gotta be this one or that one.
[73:03.68]We'll try... Oh, fuck you.
[73:10.23]Sorry I missed every single shot
[73:27.90]I like this game.
[73:29.03]This game's fun.
[73:30.46]What a good one.
[73:31.25]This is a good one.
[73:37.10]You also had the copyright protection enabled for Casino Inc.
[73:39.40]When you played it, that's why all your employees wanted raises all the time and why everyone kept puking.
[73:45.62]Well, I think we're going to have to keep it.
[73:47.09]I think we have to stay on the fucking fucked up version.
[73:49.96]You know what I mean?
[73:51.26]I'm not so sure I should change that.
[73:53.97]I feel like that changes the dynamic.
[73:59.19]I was playing on what is essentially what is the pirated game because, right, because on Steam, they never patched out the, hey, this person stole this game patch.
[74:22.96]I'm getting that star right now.
[74:26.69]Boom, teapot.
[74:30.35]Eye is right there.
[74:36.70]And then this is B.
[74:40.85]Shoot it.
[74:52.31]Was that bad?
[74:57.21]Does that disappear or is that gonna be here tomorrow?
[75:01.72]No, it'll be there tomorrow, right?
[75:13.57]Yeah, it's still there.
[75:14.89]We're fine.
[75:23.58]That hurt my brain.
[75:28.61]Auggie, you need 50.
[75:37.35]Wait, there's a password too.
[75:44.04]Why is this all censored?
[75:45.79]Oh.
[75:56.64]I don't know
[76:05.92]Gigamonk of Robbie Downey Jr. Alright, we're going to collect more shit tomorrow.
[76:15.35]Oh, no, no, no.
[76:16.27]Money.
[76:16.75]Pure money run tomorrow.
[76:19.10]Then it's a collect.
[76:20.26]We're going to collect this the day after.
[76:22.21]So we're going for money today.
[76:24.56]Tomorrow.
[76:27.84]And then after pure money run tomorrow, we're going to go collect.
[76:38.00]Pure Money Run.
[76:52.27]You fucking idiot.
[77:02.84]You suck.
[77:07.54]That's one of my favorite things when you randomly chirp out Monka Giga Robert Downey Jr.
[77:13.25]It's a fun word to say.
[77:23.88]I didn't do it right, though.
[77:30.79]Wait, it's...
[77:31.74]I have to yell it.
[77:37.10]I didn't yell it.
[77:50.32]I've been here a month and I don't know what MonkaS means.
[77:55.17]Is MonkaS falling out of favor?
[77:57.72]I kind of feel like that's not really used that much.
[78:00.83]Do people still use MonkaS or is it something else?
[78:04.05]What replaced it?
[78:14.62]has been replaced by Germafear.
[78:19.97]Oh, I haven't had a new subscriber emote in like seven years.
[78:25.98]No, it's been six or five.
[78:28.21]It's been a long time.
[78:43.80]I was telling... What did you say?
[78:45.53]I was telling my goth co-worker about you, and when she looked you up, she said you look like you have wet shoelaces.
[78:55.19]Yeah, it's a rainy day sometimes.
[79:16.54]Stop showing me to people.
[79:18.39]There's too many people here.
[79:19.64]Stop showing me to people.
[79:38.68]I show you to people every day.
[79:40.93]Stop showing me to people.
[79:47.03]How would you like if I showed you to somebody?
[79:49.38]How would you like if I showed you to one of my friends?
[80:04.28]If you show two friends, then they'll show two friends, then they'll show two friends.
[80:11.18]I need more stars.
[80:12.31]Alright, we'll go on collecting.
[80:14.76]Ah, this way.
[80:18.69]I'm gonna pick up that and that's gonna be worth a thousand stars, dude.
[80:22.97]Just watch.
[80:36.42]Can you show me to Vinny?
[80:39.39]Uh, yeah, I mean, we do that.
[80:41.36]I do that anyways.
[80:42.13]I'll be like, oh, look at, hey, look at this.
[80:43.51]Hey, look at this guy.
[80:43.99]Look what this dumbass said.
[80:45.32]And I share, like, in a chat, I'll show, like, in a DM.
[80:48.15]So I kind of do that, you're right.
[80:54.78]Can you believe what this person said today?
[80:57.26]Like, what do they want from me?
[80:58.32]Like, look at this fucking dumbass.
[81:08.13]Come here.
[81:22.24]Did any of those go in?
[81:30.11]I like it when he's mean.
[81:32.50]I'm not even mean.
[81:37.68]When I started beekeeping classes, they asked me why I was interested in it, and I had to come up with some lie instead of explaining how your sunflower streams inspired me.
[81:49.86]That's fine.
[81:55.87]Why can't you just be interested in bees?
[81:58.71]Just say that.
[81:59.17]Be like, you know what?
[81:59.79]I like bees.
[82:01.74]And I think they're interesting.
[82:02.53]I think they contribute to our world and our ecosystem.
[82:05.92]They don't need me.
[82:10.30]You know, hey, I'll tell you that, something else too.
[82:13.87]You being able to blame whatever you want on me.
[82:15.64]What's up with that?
[82:25.64]I didn't do anything, I'm just playing this suck the fucking fruit game.
[82:32.57]I didn't do anything!
[82:46.29]Uh-oh.
[82:51.00]Okay.
[82:51.12]Lock it.
[82:51.60]I'm locked.
[82:52.41]Wow, look at this.
[82:53.45]Bros.
[82:58.93]I'm collecting a ton of stuff today.
[83:01.54]Why would you take such offense to being an inspiration?
[83:03.79]I'm not, that's not what I'm saying.
[83:13.55]You've got, you've fallen in that hole 10 times.
[83:15.56]Oh, it's counting.
[83:17.85]One of you, oh, hey, hey, hey Vinny.
[83:19.45]Look at this dumb ass.
[83:23.94]He's AFK.
[83:24.53]He's AFK.
[83:25.49]He'll respond later.
[83:34.25]I want to get to 50.
[83:48.85]What happens if I suck this up?
[83:50.60]Is that bad?
[83:52.54]Is this bad?
[83:52.94]Is that bad?
[83:59.29]Bye.
[84:25.08]Huge fan of your work.
[84:26.27]Is Vinny here?
[84:29.72]Is Ster here?
[84:31.11]Oh, Ster.
[84:31.67]What's up, Ster?
[84:34.33]You like, hey, you like what you see?
[84:37.71]Pretty good game.
[84:50.88]Northernlion's here too?
[84:53.03]What's up, dude?
[84:54.42]A lot of people here.
[84:58.62]What else is here?
[85:19.91]Alright, we're going for money.
[85:21.79]Look at those green tokens.
[85:26.15]Barry Blitz incoming tomorrow and it's gonna be crazy.
[85:33.73]You shouldn't be able to at somebody in a chat unless they're actually there.
[85:36.89]Twitch, what are you fucking doing?
[85:54.01]Sorry, I got a little angry.
[86:04.39]Give me that.
[86:06.43]You piece of crap.
[86:13.64]At Thomas Jefferson.
[86:15.59]Oh.
[86:21.97]You shouldn't be able to add anything.
[86:23.25]Add should not work unless the person's there.
[86:32.40]we're going for collecting collect this I want to get that guy we need 50 stars it's very important
[86:44.89]holy shoot what the guys what guys guys look guys whatever
[87:01.14]Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[87:23.08]Nice.
[87:24.08]Hell yeah.
[87:38.64]Okay, what's a good amount of time to live that is not immortality, but is long time?
[87:51.63]I'm going by Bible here.
[87:54.56]Didn't Noah live to like 160?
[87:56.03]I think that's pretty good.
[87:59.06]I think that's enough for me.
[88:04.45]He lived about 200?
[88:05.32]He was like 180, right?
[88:19.63]70,000?
[88:20.69]Oh my god, that's awful.
[88:21.81]No.
[88:26.79]I think 160 years is perfect.
[88:42.34]Going off Tolkien, Aragorn died at 210.
[88:44.45]I think that's still too long.
[88:47.35]Nah, that's too long.
[88:51.89]Okay, so the hole is now bigger and it launches towards the hole?
[89:00.95]Activate Fountain Berry.
[89:08.29]And Blitz!
[89:11.31]I don't know.
[89:19.65]I'm fucked up today.
[89:21.08]It's a weird one.
[89:22.35]I'm sorry.
[89:22.75]I actually am admitting it.
[89:38.94]He's got his CBD sippy.
[89:41.27]Guys, I haven't had McDonald's in like a year.
[89:44.20]I haven't had any marijuana in my system in over a year.
[89:48.66]I've been sober Andy and no fast food either.
[89:52.48]I've been, I'm trying to be healthier.
[89:58.06]I have had a little bit of alcohol.
[90:00.29]Okay, let's not getting a little crazy.
[90:10.97]And I will have some drinks.
[90:13.96]During that top 300 stream.
[90:17.86]Coming soon.
[90:30.79]Isn't Gen Z drinking way less than every other generation?
[90:38.84]I saw that recently.
[90:47.20]It's too expensive.
[90:51.05]Yeah.
[90:56.33]I guess this is the first generation that actually has had marijuana legalization in most of the states.
[91:04.79]It is crazy in my lifetime
[91:07.68]going from this thing is illegal and you're going to get arrested for it and you're going to go to prison.
[91:15.24]It's like, whoa, shit, dude, that's, okay, that's fucking, that is illegal.
[91:19.95]You can literally just do it.
[91:22.79]It's very interesting to think that.
[91:24.50]And that, yeah, that's probably cutting into it massively.
[91:41.87]It is still illegal in most areas.
[91:43.42]Where is marijuana in the U.S. still completely... Like, no medical market at all.
[91:49.47]Where is it illegal?
[91:51.44]illegal illegal no medical market because even though some of those southern states have medical market
[92:01.67]Like where in the US can you like get arrested for marijuana and like go to prison?
[92:06.73]No medical.
[92:13.82]In Texas?
[92:14.46]Really?
[92:14.80]Texas doesn't have a medical market for marijuana?
[92:35.72]Texas backtracked it if I remember.
[92:37.37]I don't know.
[92:39.85]Utah, but you can get weird lab-grown weed.
[92:45.13]I don't want the fucking lab-grown weed, man.
[92:47.26]I don't know about that.
[92:56.88]What do you mean lab grown?
[93:11.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[93:16.51]That's the weird synthetic shit.
[93:18.80]I heard that hemp, right?
[93:22.11]Wasn't there some fucked up loophole where the hemp was...
[93:25.47]oh it's hemp and it was like you could just it was you get like at the gas station
[93:36.74]Delta 8.
[93:41.45]They still do this.
[93:42.41]Delta 8.
[93:47.93]You know, okay, let's get weed.
[93:50.84]Let's talk weed for a second.
[93:52.87]Isn't this the same fucking plant?
[93:55.84]I don't, I don't understand this.
[93:57.78]Isn't it the, it's the, it's just a plant.
[93:59.55]It's, it's the cannabis sativa.
[94:01.40]It's a plant, right?
[94:09.21]What the fuck are we talking about?
[94:18.34]THC-A.
[94:20.37]Doesn't cocaine come from plants too?
[94:22.94]Right, okay, but here's the thing.
[94:24.41]If cocaine was legal under a different name, that's what we're talking about.
[94:31.53]Oh, that's not cocaine, that's, uh, co-uh, it's a, uh, Coquitza.
[94:45.64]Alright, we're gonna make money.
[95:00.17]I want that berry blitz.
[95:02.93]They closed the legal loophole for Delta 8?
[95:09.01]Shit is so fucking weird.
[95:10.10]I. I mean, I can't like why it just it's it's just a what the fuck are we doing?
[95:28.18]hard to define things legally, like if you define the plant, people can just grow a variant plant, but if you ban the chemical, that's broad.
[95:38.70]Weed isn't a really weird place because it isn't...
[95:42.24]Forget about the United States.
[95:44.47]Isn't it like really super illegal overseas in a lot of places too?
[95:50.45]Like oh mega illegal.
[95:56.23]Everybody's got different roles.
[95:57.40]Everybody's got really, really hefty punishments and fines and stuff.
[96:13.75]Oh, this person's really mad at me.
[96:15.75]Derm, I swear to heavens, you're giving me severe agonizing agitation from how ADD you keep playing and ignoring upgrading your berries.
[96:23.57]I cannot begin to describe the amount of frustration it brings me.
[96:26.62]And I'm going to have to buy this game myself, like some mobile ad triggering me with... Oh, they're joking, okay.
[96:41.64]Okay, it is really weird though.
[96:43.15]Here's my final take on the marijuana thing.
[96:45.44]That acts an illegal substance.
[96:50.09]Oh, but you can just have it in that state.
[96:53.24]That's illegal.
[96:54.48]But it's illegal federally.
[96:56.37]Okay, well, what do you do?
[96:57.54]But the state, I don't know.
[96:59.25]I don't know.
[97:00.31]But it's illegal.
[97:01.00]You're doing something illegal.
[97:02.78]But you can just do it right now.
[97:04.28]It doesn't matter if you do it.
[97:05.17]You're not going to get in trouble.
[97:06.16]But it's illegal.
[97:16.45]Oh, we can upgrade.
[97:20.57]Okay.
[97:22.06]What is it?
[97:24.83]What is it?
[97:25.23]I don't know what it is.
[97:29.26]Laws have nothing to do with morals?
[97:32.25]It just is weird that it is federally illegal, but it's illegal almost everywhere by the state laws.
[97:43.47]but then some of them states are still wicked fucking illegal.
[97:46.91]I don't know.
[97:47.43]It's bizarre.
[97:48.25]It is fucking fried.
[97:56.29]It ain't even funny.
[97:57.22]It ain't funny.
[97:59.07]It's strange and aggravating, I would imagine.
[98:12.78]How did we get here?
[98:16.38]Oh yeah, I haven't smoked weed in a year.
[98:20.04]That's how I got here.
[98:27.53]Alright, here we go.
[98:28.54]Big, big money day coming up.
[98:32.00]It's gonna be crazy.
[98:36.95]We're gonna go over there.
[98:37.57]We're gonna pick up all this shit over in the corner.
[98:44.78]This is gonna be awesome.
[98:45.46]Watch this.
[98:59.29]Alright, I need more.
[98:59.93]Come on.
[99:01.02]Move it.
[99:06.19]I gotta utilize this more often, don't I?
[99:09.39]Doesn't feel like that's strong.
[99:22.34]I don't have an issue with people smoking weed, especially for medical purposes.
[99:26.54]I think that Bui just has such a weird stigma for some reason because...
[99:32.86]I don't know.
[99:41.49]We're getting into the weed politics.
[99:50.79]I don't know, just treat it the same way that we treat alcohol.
[99:54.27]Holy shit, that's so many.
[99:56.02]Look, there are open container laws in most of the country.
[100:04.56]You know, if you're like swigging back a fucking bottle of booze on the sidewalk, you can't do that.
[100:19.02]Do you want to bet?
[100:27.22]Ah, that was funny.
[100:28.71]You got me.
[100:44.20]Hey, did you know that your three DUIs don't count?
[100:48.06]And I don't have any... Oh, no, you're saying like you as in anybody.
[100:53.60]I thought you were like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[101:15.86]Alright, this is going to be an amazing day coming up here.
[101:18.07]I'm going to upgrade everybody first.
[101:29.29]Make sure I got all the coins.
[101:34.14]Alright.
[101:34.54]Crazy day incoming.
[101:35.34]Here we go.
[101:50.42]Uh, the crazy day's gonna be tomorrow.
[101:57.54]Where's that strawberry guy?
[102:00.44]Okay.
[102:04.84]Got a lot of upgraded people.
[102:07.99]Fruit people?
[102:08.53]What would I call it?
[102:09.51]Fruits?
[102:11.56]Oh, they have names, right?
[102:13.13]Bufda?
[102:14.32]Quarla?
[102:16.25]Peppy.
[102:16.67]I like Peppy.
[102:18.08]That's a good one.
[102:34.23]You spoke co- You still on the- You guys still on the weed thing?
[102:38.08]We still on weed?
[102:47.34]Why did I just shoot that at the wall?
[102:51.69]Oh no, I'm not beating the... Did he smoke a ball before this allegation?
[102:59.98]But no, I did not.
[103:08.45]Try the password?
[103:09.17]What would the password be?
[103:09.91]I gotta find it.
[103:15.65]Alright, here we go.
[103:16.11]This is gonna be crazy.
[103:17.49]Watch this.
[103:22.94]Big fountain day.
[103:24.10]Boom, boom, go.
[103:26.08]Massive.
[103:45.15]That was a gold coin.
[103:46.32]That shit was worth, what, $3,000?
[103:58.18]Damn, that's a lot of money
[104:06.35]I want to see this happen because it's so satisfying.
[104:08.43]Watch.
[104:08.80]Come on.
[104:09.48]Do it.
[104:11.53]Oh, yeah.
[104:12.09]Get in there.
[104:12.71]Get it all.
[104:16.52]No, get the text off the screen!
[104:20.20]Look at that.
[104:21.24]Yeah!
[104:26.97]It's like playing a coin game and watching the edge fall off.
[104:35.05]I have to get all these.
[104:42.67]There's too many to get!
[104:44.43]This team we need to get.
[104:52.11]I think they show up tomorrow.
[104:56.62]6,800.
[104:57.64]And there's even more back there.
[104:59.19]Hold on.
[105:03.57]Blinker checkpoint.
[105:06.08]What is that?
[105:12.83]Oh, that's it?
[105:17.71]I can't fucking believe it.
[105:19.07]What are you talking about?
[105:19.97]What is a blinker checkpoint?
[105:21.28]You fucked me up.
[105:22.98]What is a blinker checkpoint?
[105:25.26]Does that mean like, hey, it's time to take a blinker?
[105:28.11]Is that what that means?
[105:31.16]Because we've hit that period now.
[105:35.67]I lost three, four thousand dollars.
[105:39.51]Okay, explain this to me.
[105:43.39]I've seen that term before.
[105:44.62]I don't know what that really means.
[105:46.57]What is that?
[105:49.55]I think I have an idea of what that means.
[105:53.94]What is that?
[105:55.09]You hit the pen until it blinks.
[105:58.30]Okay, you hit a vape, you rip an e-pen until it blinks.
[106:04.32]It cuts you off after 10 seconds because, what, the cartridge can't do it?
[106:09.15]It's at maximum voltage.
[106:10.61]Don't be doing maximum voltage vape draws, dude.
[106:14.15]What are you talking about?
[106:15.55]Just take, just do a regular one.
[106:17.62]You're not doing that, are you?
[106:27.71]The battery can't handle it.
[106:33.86]You better not be doing that.
[106:43.20]I don't care who you're trying to impress with that bullshit.
[106:46.95]You better not be doing that, son.
[106:48.72]Or daughter.
[106:51.32]There.
[106:57.32]I feel like that would just give me a fucking headache.
[106:59.72]An instant headache.
[107:01.27]Don't do that.
[107:19.43]Whoa!
[107:20.50]How do I get that one?
[107:32.19]Blinker son or edible daughter?
[107:34.14]I'm edible daughter.
[107:35.52]I'm not doing no blinkers.
[107:37.59]Don't do blink.
[107:38.35]Why are you doing blinkers?
[107:39.32]What's wrong with you?
[107:40.16]Don't do that.
[107:49.86]Don't eat- oh my god, okay.
[107:58.55]And you made me miss the golden carrot too.
[108:02.12]I banned that person for a week.
[108:05.89]I don't know who.
[108:07.11]Just ban somebody.
[108:08.36]Ban somebody for a month.
[108:09.20]I don't, I don't know.
[108:09.80]I don't care who it is.
[108:10.84]I just want to see it pop up in the chat so I can feel like fucking strong.
[108:18.64]Ooh, yup.
[108:26.85]Okay, so I can now pop the... Press back to shoot the pump.
[108:34.27]Did you see that placement there?
[108:36.48]You see that shit?
[108:46.27]Get this shit out of here.
[108:59.85]Yep, I still got it.
[109:06.47]I need a hundred, uh, stars.
[109:09.72]Because then we can make another, uh... Let's get this.
[109:13.06]Is that a mixtape?
[109:18.74]Why does it get scary at night?
[109:19.82]I don't know!
[109:20.31]I don't know!
[109:21.15]Stop asking that!
[109:22.68]I don't know!
[109:23.32]You...
[109:26.63]The comment section is full of people saying, like, that, why does he not understand it's a horror game?
[109:30.10]I don't know!
[109:30.77]Stop!
[109:34.36]Mods!
[109:35.34]Um, help!
[109:53.04]I'm gonna hit a double blinker, somebody said.
[109:57.83]Dude, that's fucking, that's fucked up.
[109:59.96]What?
[110:00.81]Alright, I'm not gonna talk, I'm moving on from this.
[110:08.21]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[110:21.78]He doesn't care about the coins.
[110:27.99]I'm concerned.
[110:29.54]I got concerned about a guy doing a double blinker that I fucking freaked out.
[111:03.38]Somebody said I have a vape in each nostril.
[111:07.72]That's not how those work.
[111:29.10]I'm beating this game today.
[111:41.92]I need to put- can I- What is going on?
[111:49.36]My name is Donna Bellinger, and I know what happened to Barry Pomeroy.
[111:58.73]Are there cassettes in this game?
[112:01.92]Okay.
[112:06.66]Dual wielding bongs right now.
[112:14.35]How do you...
[112:21.91]Dude, I'm thinking we go for the 10 grand.
[112:23.54]No, I can't do that on stream.
[112:27.55]How are you going to get to 250k, man?
[112:42.69]What's the next play?
[112:43.47]Probably one of these.
[112:45.49]Alright, this one's pretty good.
[112:47.06]I'm going for that one next.
[112:49.03]Sludge Hammer.
[112:58.67]Alright, password people are saying, but do I know the password?
[113:01.43]How would I know the password?
[113:11.31]It's just Berry.
[113:12.54]Would it just be Berry?
[113:24.32]No.
[113:31.03]B-I-Q-T. Ah!
[113:43.78]What do I get?
[113:51.30]Donna, please disregard the previous email.
[113:52.93]It was sent to the wrong recipient by mistake.
[113:55.44]I apologize for the confusion.
[113:57.11]You'll have to find out how you run your production.
[113:58.81]This is what you think will right the ship.
[114:00.58]We support your recommendation.
[114:01.57]If there's anything else you need during the...
[114:03.24]Okay.
[114:15.77]That's scary.
[114:16.72]This is like website.
[114:19.26]News.
[114:22.94]Barry Pomeroy, an award-winning producer for hit nationally syndicated children's shows such as Sunnytime Shop and The Blanket Fort, is reported missing.
[114:31.46]According to local authorities, recently Pomeroy has been working in the small town of Halloway, Michigan, producing the new series, Ms. Rainbow's Berry Patch.
[114:41.17]Pomeroy 42 was last seen at the Starshine Studios lot late Friday evening.
[114:46.09]Creator and lead actress for Ms. Rainbow's Berry Patch,
[114:49.22]Donna Bellinger confirms he had stayed after hours to review archive footage and finalize materials for an upcoming episode.
[114:57.08]This car was discovered Saturday morning in the studio parking structure, but Pomeroy was not present.
[115:03.85]Mr. Pomeroy's disappearance is being treated as a missing persons case, said Detective Alan Ortiz.
[115:08.76]At this time, we are urging anyone with potential information to contact the city's missing persons unit.
[115:13.84]As of press time, production on Ms. Rainbow Berry Patch continues.
[115:24.22]My favorite perfect ratio.
[115:26.12]Half blueberry, three strawberry, one peach, one kiwi.
[115:30.48]Do I need to remember this?
[115:32.27]I probably have to put this somewhere.
[115:41.55]One out of seven.
[115:47.03]Okay.
[115:50.62]Creepy.
[115:53.17]Creepy game.
[116:03.16]What just happened?
[116:16.46]Alright, let's go collect.
[116:18.07]I can do it, finally.
[116:19.15]Here we go.
[116:19.69]Alright, what do I get for this one?
[116:24.29]100, right?
[116:29.34]You're a pair.
[116:30.22]200, it goes to something else.
[116:33.42]Damn, this is crazy.
[116:38.08]Damn, this is insane.
[116:40.17]How many more upgrades are there?
[116:53.20]Pear's gotta be worth a lot, right?
[116:54.66]What about a... Guys, imagine a golden pear.
[117:00.13]Oh my god.
[117:00.71]Alright, pick up the rest of this shit.
[117:09.99]Weren't we supposed to remind you to take a break after two hours of playing this game?
[117:14.26]Um... Ah, past me said that.
[117:17.08]He's an idiot.
[117:17.58]Don't listen to him.
[117:19.18]Where did it go?
[117:19.77]It just flew over the edge thing.
[117:21.45]Ah, that's the old me.
[117:25.45]This is the new me.
[117:44.46]Red ones are worth, what, $50?
[117:53.86]More episodes of Deltarune have come out.
[117:58.96]Deltarune?
[118:00.48]Maybe I'll try it later.
[118:01.28]Is it fun?
[118:18.64]beg beg
[118:32.07]This is why I could never play a game like Ark Raiders.
[118:35.73]I would do that and miss that many times and then just quit the game.
[118:44.96]It's a technique I like to call the sway.
[118:54.97]And how you do it is you press A and D back and forth.
[118:57.49]It's called the sway.
[119:09.51]Oh, I love that.
[119:10.23]Looks great.
[119:29.31]Oof.
[119:32.34]Oh, I'm not a gnelf.
[119:33.82]I'm not a gnoblin.
[119:35.09]I'm a gnome.
[119:36.64]And you've been...
[119:39.15]Remember when you guys thought that was so funny?
[119:50.47]Remember when you couldn't get enough of that?
[120:10.16]Alright, I gotta make something happen.
[120:11.23]Let's go.
[120:11.57]Fountain is ready.
[120:13.36]I'm gonna upgrade a couple more people.
[120:14.49]We're gonna do Berry Blitz.
[120:17.11]I need... Give me...
[120:18.79]I need more.
[120:20.14]Collect all this.
[120:21.87]That's the goal today.
[120:22.53]Get the seesaw.
[120:24.93]And I was just, I looked, I, God damn it.
[120:27.26]I literally was reading chat.
[120:34.87]Oh, this is gonna be crazy.
[120:47.27]Yeah!
[120:52.62]Delicious.
[121:09.90]Are you going to smoke before you laugh you lose?
[121:12.03]No.
[121:16.57]I'm going in.
[121:17.59]It's got to be sober.
[121:19.55]You can't do that.
[121:40.33]That's 10 grand in one.
[121:41.57]That's 10 grand in one day.
[121:48.05]I gotta get the berry blast upgrade.
[122:00.46]Hurry up!
[122:02.71]That's fine.
[122:09.35]Berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush.
[122:18.11]Alright.
[122:19.68]Spend the money.
[122:22.40]Vacuum capacity not a big deal.
[122:25.72]Surround yourself.
[122:27.03]Okay.
[122:27.21]I thought it said with the Bible to float.
[122:43.44]Hmm.
[122:57.66]This is so bad.
[123:03.40]I'm going to stream for two and a half hours.
[123:09.86]25% permanent berry grow speed.
[123:15.63]It actually might be time.
[123:35.72]Alright, let's go.
[123:36.48]I know how to play, I know the rules.
[123:37.73]25% permanent growth speed.
[123:44.51]I keep all my shit.
[123:46.01]Times 1.2 times 5 times 2.
[123:49.41]Look!
[123:50.03]In the corner.
[123:52.28]I'm already at five grand dude, look.
[123:58.95]You did it too early?
[123:59.94]No, no, dude, you gotta do- Nah!
[124:02.45]You gotta go really early with that shit.
[124:18.58]Golden pear.
[124:19.45]Get out of the way.
[124:20.13]All I care about is that.
[124:21.91]Move.
[124:27.91]Alright, this game, uh...
[124:30.26]Okay, I will play Infinity Nikki later tonight.
[124:34.29]I will.
[124:34.87]Alright, guys, come on.
[124:35.65]Like, what do you want me to do?
[124:42.36]This is too fun.
[124:43.88]This game is...
[124:44.99]I love this game.
[124:46.24]It's wonderful.
[124:48.05]Okay.
[124:51.81]Sludgehammer.
[124:53.34]Berry Blitz.
[124:55.13]Berry Fountain.
[124:59.43]Vacuum.
[125:02.23]Star wand.
[125:05.30]Unlocks the star orb generator.
[125:08.30]Watch this.
[125:17.61]I might, you know what I might do?
[125:19.06]Fuck it, I might just get to 10 grand right now.
[125:40.51]So many coins!
[125:52.18]Alright, now I'm gonna rewind again.
[125:57.72]Second rewind in a row.
[126:11.98]Do not fall down this hole.
[126:13.22]This is like when you drop 300 tennis balls for your dog.
[126:33.04]Okay, it's moving, it's moving, it's moving.
[126:36.49]I gotta move.
[126:55.96]Don't fall.
[126:58.70]Alright, that's good, that's good, that's good, that's good.
[127:02.15]It's 50,000.
[127:03.26]I'll get there in five seconds.
[127:05.35]We're doing it immediately.
[127:06.38]I'm gonna prestige immediately.
[127:27.22]This is gonna be crazy.
[127:28.26]Look at this.
[127:28.77]Look at how far we are already.
[127:54.71]What does Pepe laugh mean?
[128:00.42]Dude.
[128:02.24]Go to a dictionary.
[128:19.10]Golden carrot.
[128:23.45]Alright, I'm gonna save money.
[128:24.68]In 10 minutes, we're gonna get to do prestige two.
[128:30.34]I'm going to try to do stars this time.
[128:36.98]Do I even own a dictionary?
[128:37.99]I mean, all dictionaries are just kind of on the internet now, aren't they?
[128:52.76]Where's the slot chamber?
[129:03.31]Oh, I already got the Sludge Hammer.
[129:08.33]What are the stars for?
[129:09.01]The stars upgrade your berry bros or whatever they are.
[129:20.79]so
[129:36.37]There we go.
[129:45.41]What does Jerma butt chug mean?
[129:47.84]Uh, that's a banned emote that did not go through.
[129:53.24]What do you want me to say about it?
[130:09.66]OMEGALUL, OMEGALUL.
[130:10.65]You guys are thinking it's so funny.
[130:11.77]Yeah, you're OMEGALULing.
[130:16.80]You think it's funny to me?
[130:22.71]I can't even use the emote.
[130:24.88]And I had to do- I did that shit?
[130:27.99]That's the only reason why I fucking did it, is to have the fucking emote.
[130:49.54]Alright, here we go.
[130:51.45]Sweet.
[130:51.91]Let's go back.
[130:52.49]This is the big place to get a ton of stuff.
[130:58.62]Very cool.
[131:00.95]I'm going to prestige one more time and I'm not going to prestige again and we're going to just play.
[131:05.66]Because I think I'm going to have enough.
[131:07.67]What if I want to do it one more time after that though?
[131:23.93]Always add first?
[131:26.26]Minus one, reset +2.
[131:32.99]What?
[131:33.11]What?
[131:34.70]Where's the radio?
[131:36.36]Where's the radio?
[131:49.21]That's a good song.
[132:02.76]A lot of fruit is dropping, holy shit.
[132:10.05]I took too long to do this.
[132:12.21]Have to get it all tomorrow.
[132:22.47]I could see you dancing to this.
[132:24.14]It's a good song.
[132:25.50]I could dance to that.
[132:43.92]He might play it tonight for like 40 minutes if you're lucky.
[132:46.23]If he doesn't play it for at least three hours, I'm going to be... What?
[132:49.62]What?
[132:50.39]Do what?
[132:51.17]Play what?
[132:52.07]Oh, Infinity Nikki.
[132:56.17]I'm gonna play Infinity Nikki for a while, don't worry.
[133:01.39]It's only been like two hours and 40 minutes.
[133:18.68]You can't tell me that this game is not cool though.
[133:22.98]This is a great one.
[133:35.18]It's a granny game?
[133:36.65]That's fine, granny games can be amazing.
[133:39.12]In fact, granny games sometimes are actually some of the best.
[133:42.68]So, sorry.
[133:45.31]timed out internally in my head for one minute.
[133:50.18]You can't talk.
[133:50.70]You can't.
[134:04.85]Oh, I'll give you some behind-the-scenes lore of the top 300.
[134:08.00]Originally, there are a lot of actual iOS games on it.
[134:13.29]But one of them in particular I removed from the list because I said, what am I talking about?
[134:17.36]I had Angry Gran Run on it.
[134:22.77]And the only reason why was because of the song.
[134:26.31]I was like, I'm taking this off.
[134:27.52]This is not...
[134:29.47]is an old runner game and the song goes
[134:39.71]Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[134:42.40]And I thought it was like the funniest thing in the world.
[134:43.83]I was like, wow, that's a great song.
[134:46.08]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[134:53.52]It's not on the list, it's gone.
[134:54.90]I looked at it and said, this is...
[134:58.52]I'm not gonna put this on here.
[135:01.36]Mobile games in the top 300 games ever?
[135:03.30]Yeah?
[135:05.57]What, you don't think the room is not gonna be on there?
[135:08.99]There's like 340 games that I'm gonna be drinking wine and figuring out who the fuck I am, okay?
[135:17.46]You can choose to either watch or not watch that stream.
[135:20.26]It's up to you.
[135:27.01]As ballots are on that list, I'm going to say you'll have to see.
[135:58.01]Is Infinity Nikki on that list?
[136:01.19]No.
[136:03.95]Why would Infinity Nikki be on my top 300 games list when I've played it for maybe four hours and
[136:13.81]10 minutes.
[136:21.89]Is Bugsnax on it?
[136:23.21]No.
[136:29.13]How about this game?
[136:31.00]Uh, not yet.
[136:34.32]But it's looking, it's looking likely.
[136:45.08]Is Cookie Run Kingdom on there?
[136:46.52]No.
[136:48.43]Come on, please.
[136:51.42]What are you talking about?
[137:01.92]I got to pick up all the stuff in the yard.
[137:11.94]This is a star run.
[137:16.08]I'd like another berry friend.
[137:20.81]Good.
[137:35.06]What about Hello Neighbor LUL?
[137:37.40]No.
[137:41.14]Hello Neighbor would probably go on my most hated games list.
[137:44.49]Remember I told you I have to think about doing that one too?
[137:46.60]Do the evil version?
[137:55.08]We do one light and then one dark version.
[137:58.12]That probably would be on there.
[138:10.06]That would end up being the, how many game communities can you get to hate you in one day speedrun?
[138:14.10]I don't, I don't know.
[138:16.48]Maybe it's not a good idea.
[138:27.17]Would League of Legends be on there?
[138:29.08]Uh, yeah.
[138:31.97]League of Legends might be like A on my most hated games list.
[138:41.26]And I don't even care that much.
[138:43.00]I really don't, but I do.
[138:44.25]I do.
[139:01.34]But here's the problem, though.
[139:02.43]If Barry, Barry, Barry is gonna be on my top 300 games of all time list, you know the comment, right?
[139:12.53]I don't take this guy's opinion seriously at all if Barry, Barry, Barry is higher than League.
[139:17.88]You know what I'm saying?
[139:18.66]Like, how are you supposed to win with any argument ever?
[139:34.37]Liking things is so subjective.
[139:37.81]How could you ever take anybody's thoughts seriously?
[139:56.02]Wow, that was a lot.
[139:58.25]Get the hole, get them both.
[140:02.58]Oh, that's gonna be a lot tomorrow.
[140:08.59]Alright, one more day of collecting and then I'm going to upgrade a bunch of berries and then it's time to go to 50,000 and then that's it.
[140:24.79]I have to trust the opinions of others because I don't have time to try everything myself.
[140:30.57]You know, that's a really good point.
[140:37.57]The point of a critic, the point of telling somebody to do something, hey, this is something you should check out.
[140:44.70]I already checked it out.
[140:45.52]I did...
[140:46.10]I spent time doing it already.
[140:51.24]I get it.
[140:52.88]Yeah, that's the basic of critics.
[140:57.51]Say, hey, this restaurant sucked.
[140:59.47]You shouldn't eat here.
[141:02.00]Oh, okay.
[141:15.97]One time a comment from like five years ago said that I give off annoying movie critic vibes.
[141:22.88]How do you feel about that, guys?
[141:35.48]A lot of trues, a lot of trues.
[141:37.49]Well, guess what?
[141:37.98]I made that up.
[141:41.18]Show yourselves.
[141:45.98]All the people saying true, true, true.
[141:48.06]Congratulations.
[142:03.46]Alright, let me, it's time for a berry blast.
[142:08.66]This is why I just keep your streams muted and read the captions.
[142:15.98]Alright, this is a big deal.
[142:18.19]This is the day we're gonna get everything situated for the upgrades.
[142:23.65]I gotta actually lock in right now, everybody watch this.
[142:54.91]Alright, I'm ready for a berry blast day.
[142:56.68]And that's gonna turn us...
[142:59.54]It's gonna be crazy.
[143:00.40]I can't wait.
[143:05.47]And then we're going to prestige one more time.
[143:12.88]And I will not prestige again.
[143:19.14]unless chat says dude you should do it
[143:38.97]Okay.
[143:40.64]It's time.
[143:44.19]It's time.
[143:45.52]Alright.
[143:46.54]Uh, berry blitz duration.
[143:49.21]This is it.
[143:51.51]This is gonna be crazy.
[143:52.77]I don't even know what to say.
[143:56.62]Three, two, one, go.
[144:25.48]That's gonna be probably 30 or 40 grand.
[144:28.44]Maybe more.
[144:39.06]Somebody said he loves this game.
[144:41.25]LOL.
[144:41.73]Why the LOL though?
[144:46.08]What's wrong with this?
[144:46.95]What?
[144:49.04]This is a banger.
[144:57.86]This is the kind of game that my mother will watch me play and she'll go, you know, I just don't understand what he does.
[145:03.42]You know, I just don't understand.
[145:06.89]He plays games, he plays, I guess he talks to people, he plays games, and... My god, I just don't know what the hell he does.
[145:30.52]Alright, that's 25k.
[145:35.68]You run a digital daycare.
[145:40.24]Oh, man.
[145:42.02]A digital daycare for adults.
[145:51.81]Okay, something about that's really funny.
[145:55.01]A digital adult daycare.
[145:57.94]No, I ain't a daycare, okay?
[146:00.41]Get your daycare shit out of here.
[146:10.24]Uh, I'm going to save the money because I want to prestige.
[146:30.78]Merry Christmas, chat!
[146:32.54]You get to open up presents!
[146:35.34]Oh, what's this one?
[146:37.31]It's shining!
[146:38.35]oh this one this one's wrapped in a dress what it's it's a dress here it's a red dress oh it's Infinity Nikki it's an Infinity Nikki stream
[146:48.34]Thank you.
[146:49.39]Oh, what?
[146:51.05]And he's going to play it?
[146:53.16]When?
[146:53.44]It says in January.
[146:55.51]Oh, this gift is so, it's so, look at how cool this looks.
[147:00.81]Run, run, wait, run, wait, wait, wait.
[147:03.12]Uh, I have to play four hours of my fucking collect the coins game.
[147:10.11]I gotta pluck these fruits first.
[147:15.73]Wait!
[147:18.12]Okay.
[147:19.00]I think I'm almost ready.
[147:27.90]Maybe in a few hours.
[147:41.77]Look at all this money.
[147:43.79]Look at all the money.
[147:59.42]Go minus one.
[148:01.51]Alright, go two, two.
[148:04.14]What do I start first?
[148:06.73]Left, reset, one, one.
[148:15.15]What does it want me to do?
[148:21.11]Two and then one, one.
[148:26.07]I don't give a fuck.
[148:27.40]Fuck your daycare.
[148:28.37]I don't give a fuck about that.
[148:48.05]I watched your grandpa plays Modern Warfare 3 video and it still holds up.
[148:51.91]It was hilarious.
[148:54.31]Does it?
[148:56.74]It's been a while.
[149:17.64]Alright, it's gonna be a big day tomorrow.
[149:19.94]I'm gonna collect a ton.
[149:31.30]And we're going to prestige one more time.
[149:41.31]What's nutmeg?
[149:44.78]Okay, so we want to go hit the +2 and then go minus one twice, right?
[150:03.11]So now what?
[150:07.73]So there's positive two.
[150:08.91]Now this should be zero.
[150:11.66]What am I trying to do?
[150:19.96]What's the goal?
[150:20.92]What am I trying to do?
[150:24.80]Always add... Yeah, but what number am I trying to get to?
[150:32.46]Zero.
[150:50.47]What are you doing?
[151:10.07]I didn't even get any money.
[151:17.70]You're trying to get to zeros.
[151:18.77]Yeah, +2, +2, minus one.
[151:22.54]Isn't that what I was just doing?
[151:31.96]This is a donation bait?
[151:33.19]I don't have donations.
[151:39.34]Okay, this is zero.
[151:41.62]+2.
[151:42.45]+2.
[151:43.55]Minus one.
[151:48.45]It's a cool song, but
[151:55.77]So this would be 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[152:07.62]If this is at zero, I don't... No one knows what's happening?
[152:19.53]I think some of you know what's happening.
[152:23.29]Alright, money time with money, money, money, money.
[152:27.30]I gotta get 10 grand, prestige.
[152:30.01]and then we're going as hard as possible until Infinity Nikki shows up.
[152:54.95]Why are there 10,000 people but no one's spamming anything?
[152:57.16]They're all asleep.
[153:06.26]Last day.
[153:12.18]We're just chillin'?
[153:14.35]Alright, actually, this is the last day.
[153:17.89]I'm going to actually upgrade these guys one more time if I can, at least one of them.
[153:27.17]Let's try to get all the stuff in the corner here.
[153:28.79]That'd be huge.
[153:33.15]Is it big enough to drop it?
[153:46.76]Wow Oh my goodness
[153:57.04]obsessed with this game.
[153:58.52]This actually might be my favorite game of the year so far.
[154:00.54]It's January.
[154:16.19]Get the rest of it.
[154:27.68]Where's the hole go?
[154:28.79]Uh, you die and you lose a bunch of your money.
[154:32.34]It's ill-advised.
[154:47.22]dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[154:53.57]Dude, I fell asleep the night to a Five Nights at Freddy's Lore to Sleep 2 video.
[155:12.20]Alright.
[155:13.62]Not starting over again.
[155:23.67]We're at times one, almost times one and a half.
[155:26.91]We're at one and a half times.
[155:28.10]Hell yeah.
[155:32.65]What did you learn?
[155:33.37]Absolutely nothing.
[155:35.27]I put it on and I was asleep in 10 seconds.
[155:39.20]I got to the point where they said, Five Nights at Freddy's is a game created.
[155:45.13]And I was gone.
[156:06.23]Come here, chicken.
[156:11.96]Oh, a wheeler.
[156:13.12]Oh, look out, a wheeler.
[156:39.83]Whatever you say, man.
[156:41.02]Nobody knows what that is?
[156:41.99]Yeah, that's Return to Oz.
[156:44.59]Stupid.
[156:54.95]That movie's fucking dog shit, by the way.
[157:09.31]Why are you mean?
[157:10.16]I'm fucking around.
[157:11.56]Chill.
[157:25.64]Everybody write their favorite movie of all time now.
[157:28.61]See if I pick out any good ones.
[157:40.61]Vanilla Sky?
[157:41.62]A Tom Cruise movie.
[157:49.37]Roger Rabbit, good choice.
[157:55.77]Thing, good choice.
[157:57.56]Spirited Away, good choice.
[158:02.85]Credibles, good choice.
[158:05.80]Home Alone, great choice.
[158:12.56]Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
[158:14.59]Oh damn, that's a good one.
[158:26.70]Mulholland Drive?
[158:27.54]That's a good one too.
[158:30.04]That's a wild one.
[158:43.84]Nightmare on Elm Street?
[158:45.34]Wow.
[158:47.11]That's a good one, too.
[158:55.64]Ooh, something broke.
[159:05.83]What's your favorite movie?
[159:06.71]It would take me a while.
[159:07.50]I just did all my favorite most impactful video games I've ever played.
[159:15.89]I feel like movies would be a much smaller list.
[159:20.64]If I were to sit here and think.
[159:29.89]Roger Rabbit's up there.
[159:30.98]Gremlins is up there.
[159:32.81]Ghostbusters 1 and 2 is up there.
[159:35.97]I'd have to really think because I'd be missing something.
[159:41.24]I'd go, how did you miss those?
[159:52.22]Poltergeist?
[159:53.03]Poltergeist is scary.
[159:54.62]I refuse to watch that movie because of how cursed it is.
[159:57.42]I feel like watching Poltergeist is me saying, you know, I've heard about all the horrible shit with this movie, but bring it on.
[160:03.52]That's how I feel about it.
[160:07.32]I haven't seen it in a long time
[160:18.04]I feel like watching Poltergeist after knowing everything about it is almost taunting God to, you know what I mean?
[160:24.02]It's like, hey, I already know.
[160:25.05]I know lots of these horrible things about this movie.
[160:27.27]Put it on.
[160:34.24]It's inviting spirits I don't want to invite.
[160:48.06]ET is scary to me to this day.
[160:50.07]I mean, it's kind of a crazy movie.
[161:17.37]Some people don't know about the Poltergeist curse in the chat and it shows.
[161:23.00]Uh...
[161:24.41]I feel like some people, I think a lot of people, you know, I feel like a lot of people do, but they kind of shrug it off.
[161:29.50]They go, yeah, whatever.
[161:35.41]It's a movie.
[161:37.04]Whatever.
[161:39.25]Yeah, it's fine.
[161:41.06]And that's totally valid and fine.
[161:42.99]Like, whatever.
[161:43.73]That's all good.
[161:46.31]I just don't want to watch that movie and then wake up in the middle of the night and get visited by the orange orb again.
[161:53.00]You know what I'm saying?
[161:57.99]and that might not be adding to it,
[162:03.54]Well, what am I trying to say here?
[162:06.17]It's not that it's going to happen if I watch Poltergeist, but it probably will add to it if I do.
[162:15.20]I'm not getting orbed again dude, that was fucked up.
[162:20.74]I got orange orbed one night.
[162:23.52]And it was awful.
[162:25.03]Well, it wasn't even awful.
[162:25.83]It was fine.
[162:27.25]Just in case, you know, they're listening and they don't want, you know, just in case you're here.
[162:30.65]It wasn't awful.
[162:32.60]It was an experience.
[162:47.59]Alright, not fucking around, I had a dream that there was a huge orange pulsing orb in my hallway.
[162:57.24]And it was just watching me sleep.
[162:59.75]It was weird.
[163:01.68]And I woke up, I think, three or four different times.
[163:19.39]It hits every time.
[163:22.08]I love it.
[163:24.02]Alright, let's break the stone.
[163:27.15]And then we're about to move to Infinity Nikki.
[163:30.00]For those of you that are excited about that.
[163:32.51]It's coming up here in a minute.
[163:37.77]I'm going to take a break soon.
[163:39.26]And we'll open it up.
[164:03.49]I kind of want to see what that does.
[164:05.25]I'm gonna spend today doing that.
[164:17.83]So there's more?
[164:18.60]Oh dear, there's more.
[164:25.48]Oh my goodness, there's so much more.
[164:50.82]of it later can I just swing it I don't think I can I think I have to throw it
[165:05.00]Not for staging again.
[165:06.35]That is for sure.
[165:34.36]There's so much surface area here.
[165:39.71]Wow, OK, well.
[165:42.62]I didn't get any of the fruits.
[165:44.72]It's fine.
[165:57.24]Well, here's something I can assure you.
[166:00.63]We're playing this again.
[166:03.61]I'm gonna come back to this.
[166:05.88]This is gonna be my new thing I'm doing on stream.
[166:08.47]When I was 4-2-4-1-4.
[166:18.19]I legit love this.
[166:20.07]So I'm playing it again.
[166:36.46]I'm going to clear it all out and then I'm going to take a break.
[166:40.04]And I'm going to play Infinity Nickname for the seven people that I got that Christmas present for.
[167:00.25]This is crazy.
[167:01.30]I can't wait to beat this.
[167:03.25]Can you imagine eventually when we...
[167:05.23]Wait.
[167:06.27]But what if?
[167:11.14]Hold on.
[167:14.83]Hold on a second.
[167:22.07]Ugh... Shit.
[167:42.85]Come on.
[167:53.71]Wow, I can breathe.
[167:57.41]What happens if he falls down?
[167:58.41]Does he fall?
[168:03.62]Where'd it go?
[168:21.96]Whatever, I'll do it tomorrow.
[168:37.45]dev here?
[168:37.98]Oh, the dev's here?
[168:39.66]Ah, dude.
[168:42.63]This game's amazing.
[168:44.28]This is the best game ever.
[168:50.01]A lot of people were saying that this is probably higher than Donkey Kong on the list, which I've, it's, I might be.
[169:01.25]Somebody in chat said, dude, I have 5,000 hours on Donkey Kong, the original one and the Game Boy one.
[169:05.60]And they said this has been the most fun they've had in like a long time.
[169:23.83]My heart rate spiked when you played this?
[169:26.44]Is that real dev?
[169:27.54]Because this game's great!
[169:29.39]Everyone should be happy to see it.
[169:32.92]It's wonderful.
[169:36.84]It's super cute.
[169:44.03]Watch this.
[169:54.46]Yes.
[170:16.31]I gotta get all that.
[170:23.02]You can't, you gotta keep playing this dude, you can't let Devin Chattoo down.
[170:29.66]I'm still playing it.
[170:31.05]We're going to play Infinity Nikki very soon.
[170:39.56]We will.
[170:40.39]I will.
[170:43.79]Just after I get...
[170:45.86]Hold on a minute.

[170:53.74]January 31st.
[170:54.40]What's today?
[170:56.09]It's the 30th.
[170:57.92]Yeah, but you said today.
[170:59.27]It was just the 31st on this coupon that I gave you for your birthday or whatever it was.
[171:06.20]It was Christmas, but okay.
[171:07.74]Well, I got till tomorrow.
[171:11.96]You technically do have till tomorrow.
[171:15.12]Yeah, so what's the problem?
[171:20.40]There's no problem.
[171:22.32]See?
[171:23.15]Okay.
[171:23.39]So there's no problem then.
[171:32.31]So I can float now?
[171:43.40]Wait.
[171:46.28]Can I keep... Look, there's another wall.
[171:52.93]Why would I float?

[172:07.21]It says January 31st, no later than January 31st at, be on or before 1159 p.m. Just tomorrow night.
[172:16.46]That would be tomorrow night at 11.59pm.
[172:19.38]You would need to be playing it.
[172:24.32]What am I doing tomorrow?
[172:26.43]You laugh, you lose, and the clay stream, creature stream is tomorrow.
[172:31.90]Yeah, when?
[172:32.76]like around maybe three four o'clock in the afternoon maybe like three
[172:39.07]Okay, so you laugh when you do this thing.
[172:43.05]Probably like two hours.
[172:44.72]That would be about two hours, yeah.
[172:48.37]Okay, then I move on.
[172:50.38]I make the clay creature.
[172:52.85]Take about two hours.
[172:55.69]Yes.
[172:55.99]I know we can play Infinity Niki.
[173:00.45]For two hours.

[173:22.17]It's called bury, bury, bury.
[173:25.24]And the second bury is like burying an object.
[173:30.94]What a fun game.
[173:33.35]I love it.
[173:35.32]Alright.
[173:35.94]I'm going to take a break.
[173:36.58]I'll be back.
[173:37.54]We're going to play Infinity Nikki for two hours.
[173:40.53]Or more.
[173:44.24]I have to be very honest with you.
[173:46.33]I haven't played Infinity Nikki since I streamed it that one time as sort of a joke.
[173:51.48]And I don't even know why I made this one of the presents, but here we go, I guess.
[173:56.88]Apparently the game has been completely changed.
[173:58.73]I don't know anything.
[173:59.33]I forget everything.
[174:01.14]I did play a little just to get to a point where I apparently have a...
[174:06.20]a style-off with a character?
[174:08.08]There's a style-off that I'm about to do?
[174:16.56]And there's a weird mushroom world.
[174:22.08]You will see this game again.
[174:23.00]I'm going to complete it.
[174:23.72]I'm going to prestige like five more times.
[174:26.11]It's gonna be literally what I do the next stream after.
[174:28.64]There might be a horseman stream.
[174:32.41]Alright, check this out.
[174:34.65]The next stream
[174:36.10]It might be with the horseman.
[174:39.15]I'm going to start with this.
[174:40.73]And I'm going to get wicked addicted to it.
[174:42.22]And I'll do this before the horseman's room.
[174:44.48]Alright, cool.
[174:49.33]What a fun game.
[174:50.25]I love it.
[174:51.72]Literally, I'll give you a rating for it right now.
[174:54.51]It's a 10.
[174:55.69]It's a 10.0.
[174:57.16]And I don't care who hears it.
[174:58.79]It's a 10.0.
[174:59.49]Mario 64 is a 9.8.
[175:02.20]So, like, what do you want me to do?
[175:04.58]I have to be honest.
[175:07.96]alright I'll be right back all jokes aside it was really fun
[175:17.70]I will be back in three or four minutes.
[176:44.80]I'm not still playing it.
[176:51.13]I'm getting the next game ready before I go pee.
[176:54.32]I thought my mic was open.
