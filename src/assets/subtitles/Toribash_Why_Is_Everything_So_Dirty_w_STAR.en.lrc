[00:03.01]Okay, hold on.
[00:03.69]Room name.
[00:04.65]Shut up for a second.
[00:06.21]Will you shut up for a second?
[00:07.47]I'm trying- I am going to fucking kill you.
[00:13.37]Room name is- I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:18.53]Okay, room name is Stern.
[00:20.49]I'm really Stern.
[00:22.00]I put an N on it accidentally.
[00:24.20]Password is- Gerber, you're being very abrasive right now.
[00:27.98]Password is Berger.
[00:44.09]And Boo is not in the call.
[00:46.97]I'm sorry.
[00:47.43]Oh, I think I can only do that.
[00:50.03]Okay.
[00:50.83]I'm gonna get you.
[00:51.79]I'm gonna get you.
[00:52.41]You see my guy spazzing out?
[00:54.26]No, not yet.
[00:55.30]I think when the timer runs out, it's gonna do both of our moves.
[01:00.62]Okay.
[01:02.02]I'm getting close to sucking your dick.
[01:04.24]I had to remove the following dialog because it was way too inappropriate for YouTube.
[01:09.22]I hope you all understand, but there was a lot of swears and a lot of bad words.
[01:14.11]Extend the butt cheek.
[01:15.79]Look at this, like, ass on this guy.
[01:17.67]This guy's got, like, a nice ass.
[01:19.31]Oh, great.
[01:19.85]Why did I just... This is not happening.
[01:23.37]We're not doing this right.
[01:23.97]This is exactly what I said was gonna happen.
[01:26.01]Alright, I'm gonna contract.
[01:27.94]And I'm gonna, like, kick you.
[01:30.81]Okay, no, I'm ready.
[01:32.39]I'm not ready.
[01:33.91]Remember, you hit space if you're done.
[01:35.17]Alright, I'm ready.
[01:38.77]I think I've got a hand on you at this point.
[01:40.94]Yeah, you got your left hand, like, grasping my hand.
[01:43.86]Alright, but you wanna go hand-to-hand?
[01:45.80]Yeah, this is some hand-to-hand combat.
[01:48.34]Alright, okay.
[01:51.54]I'm gonna hit you right in the face.
[01:53.68]I'm gonna hit you right in the face, I'm ready.
[02:00.11]What did I break your hand?
[02:01.01]We're just holding hands
[02:08.23]Here comes the hump.
[02:10.09]You ready for the hump?
[02:11.17]All I'm doing is, like, contracting my, like, butt.
[02:14.89]Oh my god.
[02:15.37]This is gonna be worse than the last one.
[02:17.85]Oh my god.
[02:26.28]No, no, that's not cool.
[02:27.86]This isn't Jerma vs. Star.
[02:29.48]This isn't Jerma vs. Star at all.
[02:31.94]This is turning into some weird, weird shit right here.
[02:36.96]I'm like too busy looking at this.
[02:40.12]I'm gonna lose.
[02:43.97]No, I wanna do... Okay, contract that.
[02:47.39]I'm dead.
[02:48.55]My hands are off the keyboard.
[02:49.61]I like screwed it all up.
[02:52.35]Oh man, this is gonna be sick.
[02:55.65]Oh, I'm gonna shoulder tackle you.
[02:56.79]I'm gonna shoulder tackle you right now.
[02:57.91]Oh!
[02:58.59]Oh!
[03:00.49]Oh, there's 29,000.
[03:01.97]I like tried to headbutt you and you actually figured out how to like raise your arm.
[03:06.17]So no, I'm just dead.
[03:07.11]I'm just spacing.
[03:08.03]You win.
[03:08.75]I'm going to fall too.
[03:10.87]I'm not even sure.
[03:11.29]I'm going to fall way before you do.
[03:13.63]Yes.
[03:15.73]Look, I want to see this fantastic fight, where I just put my face into your face.
[03:19.96]Aw, dude!
[03:24.10]All I did right there was flex.
[03:26.58]I just, like, flexed my bicep and punched you in the face.
[03:32.24]Oh my god, that was good.
[03:33.46]I leaned right into it.
[03:38.34]I'm going all out, like, pelvic thrust into you, by the way.
[03:44.43]Shit.
[03:45.07]Oh, I blocked.
[03:46.07]I blocked.
[03:48.01]Hold.
[03:48.77]You see the situation you just got yourself into?
[03:50.85]This is the meta.
[03:52.93]I'm so screwed.
[03:53.55]I'm falling.
[03:53.97]I'm gonna fall straight back right now.
[03:55.97]Like, it's over already.
[03:59.29]I'm like, I'm taking like a dive right now.
[04:06.21]Why does everything end up so dirty in this game?
[04:17.00]Is your legs about to come across your whole body?
[04:19.62]Yes, it is.
[04:20.12]How did I win?
[04:22.60]Do you really win?
[04:28.91]I won.
[04:30.45]How did you win that fight?
[04:32.63]I throw you on... I grab your face, throw you on the ground, and, like, full windmill kick you.
[04:40.74]I think it's... Because you, like, just stepped all over my foot.
[04:47.42]I think I might have this.
[04:49.08]No, I don't think I have this remotely.
[04:52.29]But we're going to keep trying to make it look cool.
[04:55.27]This is definitely going to look cool.
[04:57.75]Nope.
[04:58.17]Yes.
[04:58.51]And end it right there.
[05:00.55]Oh, I love you so much.
[05:03.19]Well, that was the longest fight we've had so far.
[05:11.17]I seriously think you might have just dropped me in one punch.
[05:15.78]You are going to one punch KO me right here.
[05:21.03]I just like spit out my gum.
[05:25.03]You just ransacked my face.
[05:27.33]Honestly, every animation is me falling down to the ground.
[05:31.57]It's over.
[05:34.15]You seriously just one punch KO'd me.
[05:38.55]Nice.
[05:43.06]Let it play out, it's over.
[05:47.17]No, I want to fall first because I have more momentum!
[05:49.87]Wow, you really do.
[05:50.71]You won!
[05:51.91]And you told me to just let it play out, like I was gonna like try and stabilize myself, but you're like, no, I should let him fall to the ground.
[05:57.64]And I've wailed on you.
[06:01.44]Again.
[06:02.18]I can't believe I won.
[06:03.20]I didn't do anything.
[06:06.48]I got, okay, in what situation in a fight do you get knocked out, like in the face, and you like win the fight in one punch?
