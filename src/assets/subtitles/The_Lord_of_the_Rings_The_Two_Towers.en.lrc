[03:07.57]Alright, I gotta get there.
[03:21.71]No, this game is actually fucking one of the best games to come out on PlayStation 2.
[03:30.01]It's got like the red banner at the top.
[03:32.23]It's this classic PlayStation 2 game.
[03:37.26]For none now live who remember it.
[03:45.61]It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
[03:57.37]Okay, this is just the beginning.
[03:59.68]Am I allowed to watch this?
[04:04.91]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[04:07.69]This is the beginning of the movie.
[04:14.51]Get your popcorn, guys.
[04:15.61]We're watching the movie.
[04:17.01]Who above all else desire power.
[04:21.99]For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[04:28.73]But they were all of them deceived.
[04:32.13]For another ring was made.
[04:35.15]In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others.
[04:46.03]And into this ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
[04:55.88]What is this, nerd bullshit?
[04:57.28]What are you talking about?
[04:58.18]This is the greatest PlayStation 2 game.
[05:00.24]Red Banner.
[05:00.78]Nerd bullshit.
[05:01.34]Alright, alright.
[05:02.26]I really probably shouldn't be showing this.
[05:25.21]This is literally just the move.
[05:37.40]There's going to be an algorithm that's going to find this stream and I'm going to get fucking... My stream's going to get...
[05:49.97]Let's go!
[05:51.90]Defend yourself, sire!

[05:57.38]This fuckin' parry!
[05:58.12]Pull the fight, CJ!
[06:10.28]I hate that shit, by the way.
[06:18.23]Anytime a video game pulls you out, there's a huge Explore the Rings epic battle.
[06:23.37]Like, no, don't just...
[06:38.84]oh wait what do I do I wasn't looking I wasn't looking use your fierce attack to destroy his shield shield attack look at this epic battle
[07:06.02]There's combos in this game and shit.
[07:08.52]There's RPG elements in this game.
[07:11.30]I can't wait.
[07:11.84]I'm excited.
[07:29.81]Is there a dodge roll in this game?
[07:31.77]That completes the four buttons, if there is.
[07:45.02]Let's go.
[07:48.92]R2 when they're on the ground.
[07:50.38]Yep.
[07:56.77]Ooh, that was pretty sick.
[08:04.09]Good, good, good, good, good.
[08:12.09]Did somebody just say your movie sucks?
[08:16.18]I didn't make this movie Hey, dude, I just like came to stream what let you know your movie sucks.
[08:24.21]Oh Here we go
[08:44.77]This is the best part.
[08:45.61]We get the movie again?
[08:48.51]Wait, that was just... That was just the PS2 one.
[09:16.39]I wish it was the PS2 render.
[09:17.65]That would have been so much better.
[09:39.66]Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated.
[09:46.89]The ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
[09:53.60]He didn't do it.
[09:54.34]But the hearts of men are easily corrupted.
[09:57.56]Destroy it!
[09:59.65]No.
[10:03.17]I am Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.
[10:06.85]My fate is my own.
[10:08.19]The helm's deep.
[10:10.83]Oh, this is great.
[10:11.60]This is when actors get into the room in the audio booth.
[10:15.12]And they have glasses down on their nose at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[10:20.82]And read every line like this.
[10:24.20]I am Isildur's heir.
[10:25.72]To me.
[10:26.10]Let's go.
[10:27.94]Next page.
[10:28.39]They just read.
[10:29.49]Alright, let's go.
[10:31.73]Good.
[10:33.31]Mission experience 7111.
[10:34.01]Save the game.
[10:47.85]Game 1, Game 10, Game 2... What?
[10:48.89]Game 1.
[10:53.65]This game is crusty.
[10:54.67]It's very good, though.
[10:55.77]It's very, very, very good.
[10:59.77]Parry in order to block enemy attacks and deflect arrows.
[11:05.33]It's a classic game.
[11:18.80]All Isengard is empty.
[11:21.28]It is an army bred for one purpose.
[11:23.70]To destroy the world of men.
[11:27.08]The Dark Lord draws near.
[11:28.78]Baggins... Ringwraith!
[11:39.94]Get back!
[11:40.90]Uh-oh.
[11:43.50]Boss fight.
[11:44.17]Back, final thing!
[11:45.95]They seek the Ringbearer.
[11:47.55]Stay close!
[11:52.19]Wait, where's, where's Frodo?
[11:54.33]Can I lock on?
[12:04.63]How do I get, how do I put fire on here?
[12:10.48]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[12:16.00]How do I swing with the other hand?
[12:19.39]Light it up.
[12:20.31]Fire.
[12:23.61]How do I swing with the other hand?
[12:25.69]Alright, it's on fire now.
[12:34.11]There definitely is a lock on.
[12:35.29]There has to be.
[12:37.21]I know there is.
[12:39.86]Is there not?
[12:40.30]Alright, I gotta stand next to the fire.
[12:47.68]Come on.
[12:50.52]Here we go.
[12:52.72]Oh god, I'm gonna def- I'm gonna fucking lose.
[13:03.39]Frodo, do something!
[13:05.01]The PS2 fucking sucks, laughing my ass off.
[13:08.09]It does not.
[13:31.05]With one HP.
[13:33.07]Whatever.
[13:33.35]Proto!
[13:33.67]God damn it, I tried to block.
[13:34.87]I remember there being a lock on.
[13:59.95]Somebody came in and said, how are you still playing this?
[14:03.01]It's a different game.
[14:04.07]This is not the same game.
[14:05.65]I probably shouldn't have done this because everyone that left is going to come back and be like, fuck this game, dude.
[14:10.53]What are you, nuts?
[14:25.12]What happened?
[14:32.17]I think it crashed.
[14:32.87]Hold on.
[14:38.10]Give me one second.
[15:01.06]It's alright.
[15:01.50]It's because I tried to skip it really quickly.
[15:03.25]I fucked it up somehow.
[15:09.45]Ah, blue ass screen.
[15:12.29]Laundry machine.
[15:33.32]That was kind of a laundry machine, you're right.
[15:41.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:43.55]2002.
[15:43.59]This came out one year after the last one.
[15:46.45]EA Games, uh-huh.
[15:50.45]This game really is so good.
[15:52.07]I just have to be good at it.
[15:53.73]It's hard.
[15:54.15]20 years ago, almost, yeah?
[16:08.68]Watch the movie again.
[16:10.46]No.
[16:16.62]Thankfully, I did save it.
[16:19.46]Alright, let's not get killed by the cutscene.
[16:21.66]That would be nice.
[16:29.28]Return of the King is even better.
[16:32.76]They did get better as we went along.
[16:34.70]Alright, here we go.
[16:45.56]Wait, what?
[16:46.22]Hold on.
[16:46.62]No, no, no, no.
[16:47.96]I was gonna say, no, it didn't go to the very beginning, did it?
[16:49.97]Okay, we're good.
[16:50.69]Alright.
[17:07.87]Let's do it.
[17:09.07]Game's fucking hard.
[17:09.93]I gotta parry and then wipe.
[17:23.60]Take him out quickly.
[17:24.70]Good.
[17:25.34]Good.
[17:25.54]Light it up again.
[17:37.18]Every time you hear the ding, that means I did it, by the way.
[17:40.67]Look at that.
[17:47.39]It all took us one try to fucking remember how to play, and now we're good.
[17:50.31]I'm not getting swarmed on.
[17:51.50]Proto!
[17:52.36]Keep away from them!
[17:53.76]Help!
[17:54.66]They're everywhere!
[17:55.68]Attack of the Bathroom.
[17:58.18]Yeah, kind of.
[17:58.80]Hurry, Mizzou!
[18:06.96]Watch it.
[18:09.22]Come on, give me a perfect.
[18:13.22]Give me a perfect.
[18:19.03]Give me a perfect!
[18:21.53]Fuck outta here.
[18:27.05]We shall find you.
[18:36.43]Does this happen?
[18:42.12]I wasn't looking at the fucking screen.
[18:51.71]Oh, I have a special move!
[18:52.63]I don't think a special move doesn't matter.
[18:56.29]I can't even hurt them with this.
[18:58.11]Only fire.
[19:04.86]Oh yeah, if you fill that meter, you get the super moves.
[19:07.62]Now I remember.
[19:08.14]Ow.
[19:08.20]Somebody said Harry Potter?
[19:22.37]What do you mean Harry Potter?
[19:23.89]This is Lord of the Rings.
[19:24.67]Alright, we're good.
[19:27.39]Tutorial done.
[19:43.05]Somebody from Twitch is gonna skip through this VOD and see this and they're gonna go, what the fuck was he doing?
[19:48.20]Is he stupid?
[19:49.32]He's trying to get suspended.
[19:53.88]And a fellowship was forged.
[20:04.97]I will take the ring to Mordor.
[20:16.18]You own the disk of the game, right?
[20:18.48]Yeah, it's in my PS2 right now.
[20:25.54]The thumbnail is the movie.
[20:27.50]No, is it really?
[20:29.29]The thumbnail of the screen right now is just the screen half of the movie.
[20:34.67]Oh, I see.
[20:35.01]So we have it.
[20:47.31]I don't have a facecam or anything, so it just looks real bad.
[20:50.89]Alright, so I got upgrade points.
[21:00.20]Aragorn is now level 2.
[21:03.04]Cool.
[21:03.46]What can you do with upgrade points, you might ask.
[21:05.86]Somebody that thinks this is cool.
[21:12.38]Alright.
[21:15.04]Rising attack.
[21:19.37]What do I got?
[21:20.33]57?
[21:21.21]Charge forward and drive unshielded enemies to the ground.
[21:24.43]X circle.
[21:28.08]How does DNA work?
[21:30.26]I'll get this one.
[21:30.74]Let me see.
[21:43.90]Okay, here's the next part that's really bad about this.
[21:47.56]The title of the stream is, I guarantee you will like the first part of Two Towers.
[21:58.30]So... Whatever.
[22:07.56]Save the game.
[22:10.20]Yeah, I'm just streaming the first part.
[22:11.43]That's okay, right Twitch?
[22:18.63]category too.
[22:19.53]The game category is just the title of the movie.
[22:29.72]Not gonna lie, for a moment I thought you were just straight up watching the movie for whatever reason.
[22:35.16]That's so fucking funny.
[22:43.75]Okay, we have
[22:46.07]Here we go.

[23:16.84]Okay.
[23:19.04]God damn it.
[23:24.15]If you refresh... If you go to the... You're gonna refresh... If you go to like just twitch.tv/live channels and you scroll down a little bit and you find this stream, every time you refresh, hope to god it's not another thumbnail from the fucking movie.
[23:48.52]It is again No way dude that shit was just on screen for one second Shut up Well, I know it's the thumbnail right now I'm talking about in the future Alright, let's go

[24:23.57]Yuck.

[25:18.44]Checkpoint?
[25:21.58]Yeah, dude, it's PS2.
[25:22.75]Gimli's the best character.
[25:28.59]Did you know that the actor, John, was on his knees every single scene?
[25:40.89]Pretty interesting.
[25:49.22]New thumbnail?
[25:49.82]Good.
[25:58.14]Can I throw that at him?
[26:02.98]Maybe I can't.

[28:01.46]Dude, I remember playing as Gandalf coming up.
[28:03.12]There's a Gandalf section that I have to get to.
[28:05.06]That's the best part of the game.
[28:06.18]When you do the, uh... What's the big battle?
[28:09.26]Helm's Deep?
[28:11.44]Gandalf, Helm's Deep.

[28:13.70]Gandalf, Helm's Deep.
[28:14.70]Give me half HP and I'll fucking destroy it.
[28:16.43]Throw it!
[28:39.69]Wait, 5-bit says you can't do that.
[28:41.63]I'll take those from you.
[28:45.75]That's not this game.
[28:49.51]That's a different game?
[28:54.95]Oh shit, Lord of the Rings is just Golden Axe.

[29:41.90]What are you talking about axe move?
[29:43.04]What do you mean axe move?
[29:43.92]What's that mean?
[29:52.89]Do the axe move, bro.
[29:53.83]I don't even know what the axe move is.
[30:05.25]Let's get in the middle.
[30:13.15]There we go, there we go.
[30:15.05]Come on, come on, come on!
[30:16.72]Build it up.
[30:31.93]Ergon, you don't do shit, by the way.
[30:35.48]Just stand around.
[30:40.06]He's so bad.
[30:40.94]Alright, relax.
[30:43.49]No!
[30:53.50]Where's boss?
[31:04.20]Because you have to hold it and let it go.

[32:35.15]I'm reading chat.
[32:39.92]That's not me saying that.
[32:47.42]-2 for Zoomer humor.
[32:50.43]-2, your frenzy goes in the chest, man.
[32:55.67]Well struck, Gimli.
[33:02.57]This is the door of duty, Lord of Moria.
[33:09.53]At least it's not an in-game... At least it is an in-game cutscene and not a fucking movie.
[33:13.38]God damn it, it is a movie.
[33:16.20]And enter.
[33:18.19]This streamer doesn't care about TOS.
[33:23.27]Well, I do.
[33:26.36]Alright, what does Gimli have for moves?
[33:48.69]No perfects.
[33:52.01]How do you get perfect?
[33:52.83]Oh, here we go.
[34:01.14]Uh... Ball, Balan, Swift, Terror.
[34:05.04]A very effective combo if we're taking out... There we go.
[34:06.96]X, X, Triangle.
[34:07.52]That's what I was talking about.
[34:08.62]X, X, Triangle.
[34:09.94]It's very good.
[34:11.84]There's also this one, too.
[34:13.68]Rune, knock down, then finish off powerful enemies.
[34:15.94]So it's X, O, R2.
[34:17.53]Cool.
[34:20.82]Dwarven Fury.
[34:22.94]Press and hold triangle button to use this.
[34:29.70]Yeah.
[34:30.60]I'm going to get this one.
[34:32.01]XX triangle.
[34:35.57]And that's good for now.
[34:41.63]XX triangle and I also have this thing.
[34:43.37]Hold triangle to use.
[34:44.44]This is the axe move you guys are talking about.
[34:51.47]Level 1 has moves, they're all purchased.
[34:55.56]I'm going to stay with Gimli.
[35:18.87]I don't want to spread the levels out too hard.
[35:20.83]Until we get to Gandalf.
[35:33.54]Moria.
[35:34.86]It was here that we would find far more than the tomb of Balin, Lord of Moria.
[35:44.59]We have barred the gates, drums, and...
[35:49.74]Movie time?
[35:50.82]Not movie time.
[35:54.88]Not right now.
[36:08.81]Ooh!
[36:11.37]XX triangle.
[36:12.19]XX triangle.
[36:12.95]Alright, what about the move that I just got?
[36:18.34]Hold triangle?
[36:19.70]Oh yeah.
[36:24.27]That takes a while to load though.
[36:25.59]Get that shield out of here.
[36:47.52]Holy shit, that was fucking awesome Holy shit, that was fucking awesome Holy shit that was fucking hot steal yourself
[37:16.22]I remember how this works.
[37:17.34]You have to build up that meter to even get perfect or awesome points.
[37:22.56]Right, I remember now.
[37:23.86]I remember.
[37:34.77]He's mashing.
[37:35.53]I'm not mashing!
[37:45.78]He's dead?
[37:51.70]You gotta group them up and then do that move.
[37:55.73]Like that.
[38:11.60]Are we just going in a circle saying each other's names to make sure we're all in the same room?
[38:41.92]Alright, how long is this gonna go on for?
[38:45.85]I'm on two.
[38:55.55]Junkie!
[38:56.57]That's not what he said.
[39:00.23]Steal yourself!
[39:12.61]Alright, Gandalf can you blow a hole in the wall or something?
[39:20.28]Oh god
[39:42.10]Okay, that hurts a lot.
[39:44.28]Oh my god, that hurts a lot.
[39:45.32]Run, run, run, run, run.
[39:48.50]Run.
[39:50.47]I'm throwing shit at him.
[40:02.63]I'm gonna die.
[40:05.54]I don't wanna... Give me health, health, health, health, health.
[40:14.33]Oh, okay, it's only heavy attacks work.
[40:25.11]Forgive me, press X!
[40:32.52]Ah, can I block him?
[40:35.46]I wonder if I can parry.
[40:39.00]Nope.
[40:56.16]We get Gimli's cutscene.
[40:57.84]Oh god.
[41:03.52]What do I do?
[41:05.06]Oh, I have to- Hide, hide, hide!
[41:17.17]Can I block that?
[41:25.18]Nope.
[41:25.62]Oh, fuck.
[41:26.12]Don't die here.
[41:31.80]Oh, shit!
[41:40.78]Right in the eye.
[41:54.04]Okay, look at his eye.
[41:56.46]He has so many axes in his left eye.
[42:01.06]Nice job.

[42:29.08]There we go.

[42:30.80]None on perfect.
[42:32.35]Whatever.
[42:33.37]It's alright.

[42:58.79]Alright, let's do Permanently increase health.
[43:06.15]Yeah.
[43:08.97]Permanently increase your health again.
[43:10.17]I can do this more than once.
[43:11.13]I'm going to get the rush attack too.
[43:18.92]Sounds good to me.
[43:21.88]I love this game.
[43:22.48]Somebody just said this game sucks too.
[43:27.15]That's just... That's just not me.
[43:29.21]That's just not true.
[43:33.61]Lord of the Rings sucks overall.
[43:44.96]Whatever.
[43:45.38]Alright, here we go.
[43:49.83]We can go down.
[43:51.95]Photographs of characters and scenery.
[43:54.87]What do you mean phot- is this not- this is not a level?
[43:58.65]Is this just production stuff?
[44:01.09]What is this?
[44:10.36]It's just pictures.
[44:12.30]It's just photos of the set.
[44:21.20]Well, there they are.
[44:28.61]We just did that.
[44:29.29]This would be a pretty great screensaver.
[44:38.91]How many pictures are there?
[44:39.95]That's it.
[44:41.55]Alright, that's it.
[44:50.18]Okay.
[44:53.56]Change image where I can go down?
[44:55.38]No, go back.
[44:58.26]You're gonna get... Oh, the thumbnail?
[45:00.94]Will the thumbnail change?
[45:03.57]Help!
[45:03.83]I don't know how to view photos!
[45:07.23]Here we go.
[45:10.65]Dude, we're almost at literally the end of the game.
[45:15.99]Back to Gimli, let's go.
[45:28.61]Helms D. The Lord of the Rings, 10 AP, extended complete Blu-ray, DTS HD.
[45:39.86]Gandalf!
[45:40.32]Pally, you fools!
[45:54.05]Leave them now.
[45:54.67]Protect Frodo!
[46:21.98]Alright, let me try to get some perfect here.
[46:26.36]You gotta keep the combos down.
[46:29.78]Yeah, I saw the thumbnail in the face.
[46:35.80]Excellent.
[46:41.87]Gonna do more of that.
[46:44.61]More of that.
[46:54.05]They're kind of too small.
[47:00.07]These guys are like three times bigger than me.
[47:03.19]I'm like out of range.
[47:04.39]This movie is weird.
[47:24.24]Alright, what?
[47:25.16]59?
[47:25.34]I have to kill 59 people?
[47:26.18]Is that what that is?
[47:27.08]Where are the other 59?
[47:31.01]I think it's just waves.
[47:33.23]Alright, come on.
[47:38.63]Let me get, like, a fucking perfect here.
[47:42.79]Jesus fucking... Settle down, Legolas.
[47:45.15]Let us get... Let us have... You know what I mean?
[47:48.04]Let me get... What's the line...
[48:00.78]There it is Wrong movie?
[48:02.12]Is it though?
[48:03.08]Did that happen in Return of the King?
[48:05.18]When did that happen?
[48:31.24]Come on, keep the meter up.
[48:43.23]Block, block, block, block, block!
[48:44.08]This reminds me of the Chronicles of Narnia game.
[48:58.42]Why do I know what you're talking about?
[49:17.48]Killed him in one hit.
[49:19.84]Where are the other two?
[49:21.42]Why am I doing this by myself?
[49:26.04]Am I doing something... Am I doing this wrong?
[49:37.31]Where are they?
[49:42.19]They run away by myself.
[49:44.25]Alright, go back, go back, go back, back, back, go back, go back.
[50:04.31]That didn't... How the fuck did that not hit anybody?
[50:13.37]Get the fuck away from me!
[50:21.29]Quick, get it while you can.
[50:27.63]Jerma nude.
[50:29.81]Get fucked, Jerma.
[50:34.87]Oh, you got me!
[50:49.01]He was actually scared.
[50:50.09]I'm not actually... Can I pick that up?
[50:56.01]Okay.
[50:57.11]Why are they still back here?
[50:59.66]I'm missing something back here.
[51:00.58]What are you guys doing?
[51:03.26]Where did they go?
[51:03.84]Uh... Hello?
[51:23.13]I don't know why they're not here.
[51:23.97]That's odd.
[51:28.77]It's just a solo level though, alright.
[51:32.15]Ow.
[51:39.01]Alright, Gimli, get down there.
[51:44.58]Alright, 33.
[51:45.34]Wait, um, Frodo's dying.
[51:50.40]Frodo's dying.
[51:57.99]Oh, my God.
[51:59.53]Hold down L1.
[52:00.31]Hold down square.
[52:00.95]Hold down up.

[52:14.03]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[52:43.18]Where are you Frodo?
[52:50.24]He's not gonna die, is he?
[52:53.38]Don't die.
[52:54.64]I gotta do this quick.
[53:02.65]You can shoot the crossbow?
[53:03.80]What are you doing?
[53:04.50]What a dick.
[53:11.46]Keep going.
[53:11.72]Come on, hurry up.
[53:12.46]I don't have time for this.
[53:14.66]Go.
[53:33.81]Come on, I need to kill 16 people?
[53:47.36]Fro's fucking gonna die.
[53:48.58]Alright, we stop.
[53:58.92]Axe move, bro.
[53:59.78]Axe move, bro.
[54:00.40]No, I don't have to- There's no axe move.
[54:04.92]Now where?
[54:05.28]Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?
[54:05.44]Where are you?
[54:05.58]Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
[54:08.90]Nine nine nine nine nine.
[54:11.02]Hey guys I made it.
[54:25.02]What happens if I break the cutscene?
[54:33.87]No, no, no!
[54:46.36]That sucks!
[54:51.64]He crushed his head.
[54:54.28]I didn't even realize.
[54:56.63]I thought that we were fighting together and they ran ahead of me.
[55:00.08]Oh, fuck me.
[55:02.76]Fuck me.
[55:03.74]Give me a break.
[55:06.32]What did I just do?
[55:07.18]I wanted to... I'm sitting there looking and walking around in circles looking for these two and they ran all the way to the bridge.
[55:35.66]I don't even know how that happened.
[55:37.22]That seems almost impossible to happen.
[55:47.12]Can I fucking hit- I'm getting angry.
[55:53.17]The same shit's happening again.
[55:54.75]I'm too small to hit these guys.
[55:56.77]When they're in this spot, exactly.
[56:01.94]Alright now now what now we oh yeah, yeah what you stand around this is the same shit that happened last time
[56:20.71]And then they disappeared, and I was looking for them, and they appeared at the fucking bridge.
[56:26.54]Just go.
[56:28.82]Just fucking, fuck it.
[56:30.26]You don't have the range.
[56:47.71]yeah sure just go ahead of me and run to the bridge you two assholes we must defeat these no we're not here sorry Gimli do it alone
[57:19.29]I used to watch my cousin play this.
[57:24.34]It's pretty good.
[57:29.84]Alright, go.
[57:41.60]Just go down to the bridge.
[57:42.48]That's gonna be the easiest place to farm this shit.
[57:49.14]Oh my god.
[57:50.54]Go!
[58:19.77]I'm standing in the fire.
[58:22.57]Those are gonna kill me, right?
[58:29.90]Okay, made it to the bridge.
[58:38.90]I actually have my two other heroes now.
[58:43.55]Thanks for waiting.
[58:55.08]I actually play the game now with you two.
[58:56.48]I can't let the Jerma die.
[59:05.10]Never mind.
[59:06.48]Yeah, now I can... This is how I'm supposed to be playing this part.
[59:30.78]Should we trigger the cutscene on the bridge?
[59:32.40]Yeah, come, come, come.
[59:33.70]Alright, geez.
[59:43.27]Now I'll get it.

[62:28.22]No, I have to shoot him with arrows.
[62:31.60]I can't hurt him.
[62:32.04]I have to do full charge.
[62:35.37]I'm gonna just have to start this fucking shit over.
[62:48.19]It's the tree boss again.

[64:19.14]I have no vocabulary right now.
[64:21.80]It's gone.
[64:25.31]How do I hurt him?
[64:25.93]I was challenged outside of the logo 7-11.
[64:35.45]That's a show.
[64:43.53]This is so stupid.
[64:44.85]Why are you right about this?

[66:24.39]That just gets upgraded.
[66:26.41]Attack as you regain your feet, taking enemies by surprise.
[66:29.03]Yes.
[66:31.69]I need that so bad.
[66:34.30]Wound, knock down, and strike your enemy with this combination.
[66:36.64]Alright.
[66:44.69]I like this one.
[66:45.95]X triangle XX.

[66:56.26]Appreciate it.
[66:59.38]That's 10 subs.
[67:01.16]On top of the shitload that everyone's given so far.
[67:03.26]Thank you.
[67:09.15]The sound is a half second before the video.
[67:13.15]Is that for real?
[67:25.27]you should be hearing a right when the light you see the light bang bang bang bang you should be seeing that hey guys I'll fix it right now one two one two one two one two
[67:59.79]I forgot to delay my mic by about 300 or 400 milliseconds the whole stream.
[68:05.51]It's been like that the whole time.
[68:14.05]Okay.
[68:17.39]Just redo the whole stream.
[68:23.81]What a noob.
[68:27.31]Now it's unwatchable.
[68:33.48]Nobody even noticed.
[68:37.84]Despite Boromir's heroism, the servants of Sodom and captured members of our company.
[68:43.19]But we would not abandon our companions to torment and death.
[68:46.95]For days we followed their trail.
[68:49.65]Finally it led us to Fangorn Forest.
[68:54.97]This forest is old.
[68:57.73]No shit.
[68:58.22]Good transition there.
[69:02.70]Some of you guys that might remember.
[69:09.73]That was... That was so cool.
[69:11.19]20 years ago.
[69:11.61]It really was.
[69:30.41]Let's split up.
[69:33.05]What'd I get?
[69:33.39]I got a new combo, right?
[69:36.29]That looked pretty good.
[69:37.94]Out of the way.
[69:45.18]Alright, these guys got shields.
[69:46.68]Break those shields.
[69:47.32]I'm just gonna farm parries.
[70:09.10]Bounced around.
[70:15.36]Fuck!
[70:15.74]I had it.
[70:16.14]He's getting hit by every attack.
[70:32.19]There's five people around me.
[70:40.16]Sorry I didn't practice my PlayStation 2 action game skills before this stream started.
[70:56.37]Wait, what did he drop?
[70:57.49]Is this another tree boss?
[71:09.15]Is this a tree boss?
[71:10.47]It might be.
[71:12.70]Oh, great.
[71:13.60]That's shit.
[71:17.02]Troll.
[71:19.38]He's dead.
[71:19.92]That wasn't that bad, actually.
[71:26.64]That was pretty easy.
[71:42.09]How do I unlock Gandalf?
[71:46.03]You don't in this game?
[71:58.23]Oh, that's only in the turn of the game.
[72:02.17]That's unfortunate.
[72:18.02]Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.
[72:25.21]They can't kick me in the hole, can they?
[72:36.57]Give me that meter.
[72:43.40]Meter, got it!
[72:46.36]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[72:47.04]Come on.
[72:47.40]Anybody else?
[72:48.90]Somebody, somebody, please.
[72:49.74]Give me the meter.
[73:16.77]Are they alive?
[73:20.22]No.
[73:20.34]Let's go.
[73:26.48]I have to move slow.
[73:28.23]Is this the BBBBBB stream?
[73:30.65]What is that?
[73:31.93]I don't know what that means.
[73:58.65]Just do that move like three times in a row He's drowning while fighting
[74:19.68]V, V, V, V, V is a good game.
[74:26.19]That's the gravity one, right?
[74:37.43]That's pretty cool.
[74:51.17]It just got released open source.
[74:52.53]I always imagine that's probably... So does that... So people can now just essentially have the entire game's code to be able to make their own levels?
[75:10.25]What's the benefit of doing that?
[75:11.17]What do you... Can you make like a sequel or something?
[75:15.31]Make your own levels?
[75:16.11]Make your own game?
[75:17.17]Essentially in the game?
[75:18.40]So on GitHub.
[75:19.02]That's crazy.
[75:21.58]I wonder what the legality of that stuff really is.
[75:24.01]I guess if you self-publish, right?
[75:38.05]What's going on?
[75:40.99]Why can't I move?
[75:45.81]I was just like stuck.
[75:47.27]That's weird.
[75:54.16]What?
[75:55.56]Okay, that's just... That's my mirror.
[75:57.52]I thought that was an enemy.
[75:58.24]I'm really starting to overuse this.
[76:05.44]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[76:18.99]I know you're going to scare me.
[76:25.33]Come on!
[76:26.19]I need it!
[76:30.76]Come on!
[76:31.84]How have I not done it yet?
[76:34.00]Is this the same one where you defend a door?
[76:53.06]I actually have no idea.
[77:07.54]Click, click.
[77:08.68]Boom.
[77:10.00]Click, click.
[77:11.04]Boom.

[77:16.98]Oh well.
[77:27.15]Gimli has terrible range.
[77:29.09]Yeah.
[77:30.71]I'm already playing as him though.
[77:33.23]If I played a design... If I took another character...
[77:37.39]I don't think it would go over so well with chat, you know?
[77:39.23]They want me to play the little guy.
[77:50.49]Well, alright.
[77:51.59]Am I gonna pull him?
[77:56.29]Jesus.
[77:57.27]How am I gonna do this?
[77:58.89]What the fuck?
[78:02.75]Uh...
[78:07.99]Die.
[78:16.35]Come on.
[78:17.29]Jesus, that hurts.
[78:18.15]Oh, man!
[78:20.63]Get out of the way!
[78:23.14]There's health right behind him.
[78:30.66]Was that grass?
[78:32.26]Was that grass that I saw?
[78:34.16]What?
[78:34.38]Was that grass?

[80:47.88]I win.
[80:48.58]Good.
[80:49.22]Alright, let me see this link.
[80:52.04]What do you got?
[80:53.61]We need him to see this.
[80:55.73]What is it?
[81:02.33]You guys are so quick.
[81:04.13]I love it.
[81:05.75]This is going to be great.
[81:07.75]I already know this is going to be a quality video.
[81:10.19]Okay, let's hear it.
[81:22.99]Did you reach Sen's Fortress yet?
[81:25.05]No.
[81:25.95]Not yet.
[81:26.69]Hopefully soon.
[81:32.74]Okay Why can't I hear anything?
[81:53.41]Okay, there we go It's CCTV
[82:12.77]There's people lying on the ground.
[82:16.45]What happened outside?
[82:19.33]What could have possibly happened?
[82:27.46]Is that it?
[82:31.56]Look over here, ready?
[82:36.00]Somebody's already dead back there.
[82:38.23]Somebody's already been beat up.
[82:40.09]Three people.
[82:43.24]He throws the axe, too.
[82:45.94]I love this so much.
[82:54.76]That's quality, man.
[82:55.89]Seriously.
[82:56.81]That is absolute quality.
[82:58.07]That's just me playing.
[83:06.67]Well, yeah, I know.
[83:16.92]when we met up.
[83:18.44]Oops, Saruman.
[83:19.72]Do you fight Saruman in this?
[83:45.92]There is a union now between the two towers, Orthanc and Baradun.
[83:52.06]This really is kind of the TL;DR of the whole thing, huh?
[83:58.98]You are needed elsewhere.
[84:00.92]War is coming to Rohan.
[84:17.36]More points.
[84:19.02]Go five, do it.
[84:23.13]I remember when I was younger, I was able to get so many points.
[84:28.89]Everything was almost all excellent.
[84:30.17]I don't even know how the hell I did that.
[84:31.43]How the hell did I do this?
[84:36.28]How about this one?
[84:42.81]I'll do this one.
[84:44.21]Or maybe I'll just save.
[84:46.94]No, this one looks cool.
[84:48.72]X-Circle Triangle.
[84:55.40]You had a non-void gamer license.
[84:57.20]That's true.
[85:03.97]Motor skills deteriorate with age.
[85:06.51]I'm not even sure that's what it is.
[85:07.85]I think it's just games changed.
[85:10.81]I didn't change.
[85:12.07]Games changed.
[85:13.98]Not me.
[85:26.86]It's the children that are wrong, not me.
[85:33.01]Yeah, this one kind of sucks This is a self a vertical video really vertical picture What you don't know is
[86:03.53]I don't know the actor's name.
[86:05.55]Christopher Lee?
[86:09.18]Is it Christopher Lee?
[86:10.30]What's the actor's name?
[86:13.92]It is, right?
[86:14.76]Yeah, I...
[86:25.65]I think I might have burnt out right now.
[86:27.27]I was going to say, what you don't know is, right before this scene started to be shot, Christopher Lee said a funny joke to Paul Stevenson right before they started shooting.
[86:37.78]That's not a snarl.
[86:39.54]That's a smile.
[86:40.64]But they left it in the movie.
[86:42.92]I was going to do something like that.
[86:44.19]I might have burnt out right now.
[86:45.69]What's going on? ...
[86:54.99]He's getting old!
[87:08.12]Low blood sugar?
[87:09.02]Oh, maybe.
[87:09.44]I don't know.
[87:14.16]The tree took seven years off of your life.
[87:19.02]Plains of Rohan.
[87:25.54]It must have consumed my entire life force.
[87:28.36]It probably did.
[87:42.29]I also gave a shitload of it away too.
[87:43.85]Yeah, why did I do that?
[87:45.20]What was I doing that for?
[88:06.83]I remember this part.
[88:08.65]I actually do remember this part.
[88:13.64]Yep, this exact scene.
[88:17.54]Yeah.
[88:18.94]There's Gandalf.
[88:26.77]Didn't move.
[88:28.87]There was a string when I was younger where I could have perfect 100%.
[88:44.98]Oh, come on.
[88:46.94]Gandalf, you're so bright.
[88:48.20]You're getting in my way.
[89:02.27]He got past the tree?
[89:03.75]Eventually I did.
[89:06.33]No, you can't introduce Gandalf and then delete him.
[89:08.45]That's not fair.
[89:22.25]Um... What happened?
[89:23.70]What's going on?
[89:30.99]The cutscene just didn't trigger.
[89:33.53]Okay, that's great.
[89:41.97]Watch out!
[89:42.25]Get out of the way!
[89:43.47]I have to save the family!
[89:46.07]I blame the cutscene not happening.
[90:00.70]I stood around for like eight seconds, and then the cutscene just didn't work.
[90:04.32]I was like, am I in the right spot?
[90:09.60]Save the family.
[90:10.34]I'll get them.
[90:19.15]You didn't have to run under the fire.
[90:26.27]Well, I thought I was supposed to go up the stairs.
[90:28.97]Which I was, but it wouldn't let me until the guy fell down.
[90:38.50]He's gonna watch, Gandalf.
[90:48.53]You must save everyone that we can, or this village will fall.
[90:52.69]He zapped him?
[90:53.25]Yeah, but come on in here and fight with me.
[90:58.60]Let's go.
[90:59.42]What is this bang bang bang?
[91:01.12]My nose is so itchy right now Just burn him
[91:24.58]You must open it Jerma broke into my house at 3 a.m Naked ranting about how he needs the keys to my car to flee to Mexico after he streamed Lord of the Rings and got banned Open it Wait, does he does he need to walk?
[91:42.79]Okay, what is going on?
[91:43.79]He needs to walk in the room first Alright get up there
[91:57.52]Why do you have so many fucking tables in your house?
[92:00.82]You don't need this many tables.
[92:22.78]Families were huge back then.
[92:26.02]Where is this family?
[92:35.05]The camera switches.
[92:42.75]Dude, are you going to block every attack I do, man?
[92:45.12]The old man is getting fucking destroyed.
[92:48.60]Get out of my way.
[92:51.96]He's plogging everything!
[92:53.08]This old guy!
[92:56.64]I'm coming!
[93:07.09]What?
[93:10.03]Are you safe?
[93:11.35]Alright, go!
[93:17.97]Where's the rest of the family?
[93:21.17]They're all over there.
[93:22.33]How do I get over there?
[93:22.83]How do I get over here?
[93:24.27]How do I get over there?
[93:27.82]What?
[93:28.00]Above the roof?
[93:38.44]Okay.
[93:39.16]It was on fire.
[93:50.73]I don't even know what happened.
[94:42.56]He likes the first part.
[94:43.96]I guarantee you'll like the first part of Two Towers.
[94:48.14]Isn't the first part of Two Towers Fellowship with a ring?
[94:53.89]Fuck, that's actually correct.
[95:06.06]The last level of this game is hard as fuck.
[95:12.08]I don't remember... I don't remember the run around and save... I don't remember any of this.
[95:17.98]Zero.
[95:18.30]Is somebody still dead?
[95:21.84]One... Open the door.
[95:22.36]I wish I could save the game right here.
[95:35.95]Okay, get clean.
[95:36.99]Let's clean this up.
[95:37.83]Seriously.
[95:52.82]Best PS2 game ever.
[95:54.40]Also me.
[95:54.94]I don't remember this.
[95:57.18]No, I don't remember a game I played 20 years ago.
[96:00.96]I was like fucking 15.
[96:07.13]I didn't play this last weekend!
[96:13.93]How am I almost dead?
[96:38.85]The fuck over here Oh go go go go go go go What the fuck break it what give me a break man I
[97:07.02]Who's left?
[97:07.36]Who's left?
[97:07.72]Has somebody left?
[97:08.98]I can't help that person.
[97:10.90]Oh, God.
[97:11.34]Everything's on fire.
[97:12.70]Did I do it?
[97:24.31]Who's even... Oh, there's Gandalf.
[97:26.05]Good.
[97:27.41]Thank you, Gandalf.
[97:28.03]Help us.
[97:38.79]Don't fucking die.
[97:48.40]Okay, I'm losing my mind.
[97:53.16]What's he doing?
[97:54.44]Pal, they're gonna burn.
[97:55.68]They're gonna burn.
[97:56.06]They're gonna burn.
[97:57.44]What do I have to do?
[97:57.94]What do I have to hit?
[97:58.47]I don't even know where they were.
[98:10.16]I don't even know where that person even was.
[98:11.80]I tried to throw an axe at the barrel and it didn't even do it.
[98:15.54]Oh, fuck me.
[98:35.88]Get the fuck in here.
[98:39.92]Just kill them.
[99:08.21]I'm starting to tell it's happening Who's this person and why they're not staying to help
[99:43.26]It's already at fucking 50%, man.
[99:50.08]I can't even do anything about this.
[99:51.64]Is it 50% already?
[99:54.94]What are you talking about?
[99:56.38]They're already dead.
[99:58.46]They're already fucking dead.
[100:01.98]What?
[100:03.04]This is unfair.
[100:04.02]This is not fair.
[100:07.46]This motherfucker's dead already.
[100:14.06]I can't even... This is impossible.
[100:27.41]Get out of the fucking way.
[100:39.91]Out of the way.
[100:40.45]Out, out, out, out, out.
[100:41.01]Where are they?
[100:41.63]Where is it?
[100:47.30]I'm gonna die.
[100:52.82]Give me health, please.
[101:02.03]Health.
[101:03.13]Health?
[101:06.41]Alright, go save the... Save the village right over here.
[101:28.92]They're getting killed.
[101:30.29]There's nothing I can do about it.
[101:41.51]That guy comes out and just starts slashing motherfuckers.
[101:46.17]And there's five people around me.
[101:48.26]I can't even throw anything up there.
[101:50.60]It takes Gimli five seconds to throw a fucking axe.
[101:55.39]Wanna see how long it takes Gimli to throw?
[101:59.43]Ready?
[102:10.84]Let's see how long it takes.
[102:13.12]One.
[102:14.02]Two.
[102:14.78]Three.
[102:14.92]It takes almost full three seconds to throw a fucking axe.
[102:17.84]This character sucks.
[102:19.46]This character sucks!
[102:21.12]Why did I pick it?
[102:22.00]For the meme!
[102:22.98]And now I'm disappointed!
[102:27.09]Damn it I can't even I can't even
[102:56.41]Where's this thing you want me to do before I get in the building?
[103:02.27]So I don't lose 80% of the village people's health?
[103:05.52]Where is it?
[103:06.26]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[103:25.65]Give me a break.
[103:29.79]The fuck is this?
[103:46.84]I swear to God.
[103:47.50]Get out of the fucking way.
[103:59.30]Get out of the way.
[104:07.70]I can do it.
[104:08.32]I can.
[104:13.60]Hey, you should have guaranteed I wasn't going to beat the two towers because this game is way harder.
[104:41.92]Go.
[104:43.53]Barrels.
[104:49.41]Hurry up.
[104:57.04]Come on.
[104:57.34]Come on.
[105:07.61]Get the collectible.
[105:08.41]I don't give a shit about a collectible.
[105:09.51]I'm trying to beat this stupid part of this mission.
[105:12.26]Well, now I'm surrounded.
[105:14.28]And the guy comes out and starts slashing people.
[105:16.82]Alright, get up there.
[105:18.94]How do I get up there?
[105:30.55]That guy up there!
[105:31.15]Save me!
[105:34.81]Please save me!
[105:42.34]Even fucking Gandalf can't even hit this motherfucker.
[105:44.43]We can't hit him.
[105:45.99]Even the AI can't do it.
[105:47.83]I'm cracked.
[105:48.19]My voice is cracking.
[105:48.97]Alright, settle down.
[106:00.16]I don't... I don't understand what's happening right now.
[106:15.20]Don't I go up there?
[106:16.35]I... I'm not soft locked.
[106:37.26]We care about the townspeople, not about these people though.
[106:55.07]Please get rid of that meter.
[106:56.65]I don't want to do this anymore.
[107:05.35]Get in that building.
[107:06.11]Get in that building.
[107:07.17]Get away from me.
[107:08.11]Get away from me.
[107:08.53]Which building are they in?
[107:09.19]This one?
[107:10.15]Is it this building?
[107:14.29]What building are they in?
[107:16.65]What building are they in?
[107:25.62]Get out of my way, please.
[107:26.96]I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[107:32.86]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[107:34.20]Gandalf is getting his ass kicked.
[107:37.72]No, stop.
[107:38.36]What are you doing out here?
[107:41.32]Get away from this.
[107:43.08]Get away from this.
[107:43.94]Why are you here?
[107:45.38]Please get away from the battle.
[107:50.30]Do they leave?
[107:51.91]Oh my God, Gandalf.
[108:08.19]Okay, go.
[108:09.09]What's left?
[108:09.49]Oh my god, I'm so... I am... That was ridiculous.
[108:12.35]Alright, let me play as Gandalf.
[108:43.98]No Gandalf.
[108:45.94]I didn't level up either.
[108:49.66]Shit.
[108:50.62]I must have done pretty bad then, huh?
[108:55.14]Oh well.
[108:55.62]I'm gonna save my points.
[108:58.45]God damn it.
[109:15.00]The first playable... I gotta eat a fucking steak after this.
[109:19.00]I don't know what's going on today.
[109:28.06]Alright, we're almost done.
[109:29.80]Four or five more levels?
[109:31.58]The Westfold.
[109:32.44]I don't need production photos.
[109:37.43]Alright, I'm gonna try a different character.
[109:38.85]Let's try Legolas.
[109:58.43]We are not alone in defending Rohan.
[110:01.02]The King's Guard were also fighting through to Helm's Deep.
[110:08.66]I have seen it before, but never like this.
[110:26.29]Yeah, I've got gamer snacks.
[110:29.50]I'm gonna grab one.
[110:30.72]Alright, if I fail... The next time I fail the mission, I'm gonna get a gamer snack.
[110:34.48]I got Crave.
[110:34.96]Beef jerky.
[110:35.78]Alright, let's check out these booths.
[110:37.40]I'm gonna get a fucking gamer snack.
[110:39.19]I'll be right back.
[113:38.68]Okay.
[113:40.38]I got my... I got some, uh, grade A beef here.
[114:01.03]Show it?
[114:02.63]Just crave.
[114:03.13]I don't have any clothes on.
[114:06.01]I can't turn it off.
[114:09.34]I have seen it before, but never like this.
[114:23.21]And this is what I needed.
[114:28.50]This is absolutely what I needed.
[114:29.46]Our only hope is to stand together.
[114:31.70]Now that's the power of peanuts.
[114:35.06]You ready?
[114:36.26]Help us destroy them.
[114:37.88]Watch this.
[114:40.11]Oh, already a better character.
[114:50.40]I'm doing Gimli so wrong here.
[114:51.86]He's great.
[115:09.13]I'm getting my ass kicked Oh, he's level one that's right.
[115:28.71]Oh my god, you're right.
[115:31.19]Holy shit.
[115:31.59]I'm gonna die by two auto attacks
[115:37.35]I thought you were on my team.
[115:50.99]What do you mean you're doing easy mode?
[115:52.57]This is just how the character plays.
[115:54.97]It's Legolas.
[116:09.72]That guy has a bomb on his back.
[116:11.74]Watch out, watch out, watch out, that guy has a bomb.
[116:21.19]Oh, sorry guy.
[116:33.87]Back it up.
[116:41.67]Holy shit, there's a lot of fucking people coming.
[116:48.55]What are you aiming at, Legolas?
[116:50.57]What are you aiming at?
[116:51.36]There's nothing over there.
[117:03.61]Good.
[117:08.65]Don't move.
[117:09.27]Oh god.
[117:13.48]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[117:16.78]I got a jerky moment.
[117:21.65]Why am I doing this so slow?
[117:24.55]That was the slowest I've ever put food in my mouth.
[117:27.95]I dropped it like three times.
[118:15.02]That was sandy for some reason.
[118:27.10]What is he... What are you aiming at?
[118:28.58]This guy is fucking dead.
[118:33.08]That guy is... Buddy, that guy dropped his last life potion.
[118:36.52]Hold on.
[118:36.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:37.78]Don't kill me.
[118:38.86]Oh my fucking god.
[118:40.26]Alright, I...
[118:54.68]I don't think I can do this at level 1.
[119:03.60]I can't do this at level 1.
[119:08.09]Somebody said... Are you streaming at the beach?
[119:12.71]Because they hear the cars drive by.
[119:26.72]No, it's because of the sand.
[119:29.82]Oh, it's not because of the sounds of the waves of the cars going by?
[119:33.28]That too?
[119:45.18]Yeah.
[119:45.80]Our only hope is to stand together.
[119:49.18]Saruman's forces move strange explosive devices through this town.
[119:52.84]Help us destroy them.
[119:56.58]We must destroy these explosive devices.
[119:58.35]Try this one more time.
[120:00.39]I'm turning it on now.
[120:01.07]I'm gonna actually do try as hard as I can.
[120:20.41]I'm glad to keep the levels though.
[120:36.73]I'm taking way too much damage ahead.
[120:38.23]I can't do this with Legolas.
[120:40.73]I'm gonna get combo'd by somebody in insta-die, and I'm gonna be so mad about it.
[120:43.99]You all know what's gonna happen.
[120:44.83]You know what I mean?
[120:46.43]Ah, no way.
[120:47.91]Streaming 5G?
[120:53.91]What are you talking about?
[121:11.32]Somebody dropped something.
[121:12.72]Thank you.
[121:13.04]Alright, we're good.
[121:20.79]Does level increase your health?
[121:21.83]I can buy it.
[121:24.93]This is gonna be rough, though.
[121:48.01]Alright, we gotta get out of the fucking way just body blocking me.

[129:26.71]Old horse think
[129:29.64]Thank you, Oathorse.
[129:30.50]Seriously.
[129:31.82]I bought five subs tonight.

[129:37.39]My daughter and I are huge Jerma fans and I was thrilled to see my game on the channel.
[129:42.05]That's so sweet.
[129:43.09]Thank you.
[129:43.41]It's a lot harder than I remembered.
[129:48.72]But still, it still holds up 20 years later.
[129:51.88]Good work. ...
[129:59.41]Okay.
[130:01.41]Right when I come back.
[130:06.99]I think I just breathed in jerky.
[130:08.91]I just breathed in beef jerky.
[130:10.27]Is that bad?
[130:10.83]Am I going to hurt me?
[130:13.79]It's in my lungs.
[130:14.80]Did I just breathe it in?
[130:15.68]Is that bad for you?
[130:16.76]How bad for you is that?
[130:18.26]How bad for you is breathing in beef jerky?

[130:33.89]I couldn't run f- I can't fucking believe it.
[130:49.93]I couldn't walk backwards anymore.
[130:51.31]Um, okay.
[130:54.63]I just like breathed in and beef jerky went into my lungs.
[131:03.31]Dermot, you aspirated food!
[131:04.58]I mean, I'm alright.
[131:05.30]I probably didn't.
[131:25.34]Why did I pick beef jerky?
[131:30.34]I should just have a tahini sludge for a stream snack.
[131:34.97]Why beef jerky?
[131:35.75]It's so hard to eat.
[131:38.79]I just fucking aspirated food.
[131:42.13]Because I should just make a smoothie.
[131:57.31]eat on Earth.
[132:00.54]I may as well have just chewed bubble gum and swallowed it.
[132:14.15]What the fuck am I doing?
[132:32.51]Aspirating food.
[132:35.64]Is that actually even possible?
[132:37.26]Can you like inhale food and it like...
[132:47.05]Yes, but you just did wouldn't what wouldn't I see other symptoms?
[133:09.47]It's called your it's called choking
[133:17.27]Choking doesn't mean food is in your lungs, chat.
[133:22.47]That's not how that works?
[133:25.37]Alright.
[133:37.89]I swear to god, if I get to go to the doctor tomorrow...
[133:42.15]And they're like, yeah, what happened?
[133:43.81]Looks like you aspirated beef jerky.
[133:45.89]How?
[133:47.21]Well, you see, Doctor, I was playing a 20-year-old game called Lord of the Rings.

[133:57.76]And you see, the dev came into the chat.
[134:00.26]The dev of the game, and it was like a big surprise.
[134:03.17]And then I unpaused the game, and three explosions happened around me, and I inhaled beef jerky.

[135:11.07]Imagine aspirating beef jerky on stream.
[135:14.69]People ask, Jerma, why don't you eat on stream?
[135:16.41]That's not a big deal.
[135:17.14]Eat on stream.

[135:20.82]And I... Strange shit happens to me all the time.

[152:26.30]That's the final mission of the whole game.
[152:30.66]I'm close.
[152:32.00]Only three more missions.
[152:37.07]After this one.
[152:51.62]I'm gonna stay with the original.
[152:52.56]I'm gonna stay with Gimli.
[152:55.04]I need 10,000.
[152:55.72]Didn't get it.
[153:07.77]I hate this.
[153:08.27]I don't like this image.
[153:25.14]9,000.
[153:25.32]Uh, I need this.
[153:32.00]I'm gonna wait.
[153:38.75]Jesus.
[153:40.05]Is that?
[153:40.37]Oh, hold on.
[153:40.95]Wait a minute.
[153:44.21]That's not even... You made those bigger.
[153:49.15]Didn't you?
[153:53.32]Even in the real image, I don't think those are that big.
[154:03.76]No, that's an accurate image.
[154:28.14]Gap of Rohan.
[154:30.46]Look at this.
[154:30.90]We're almost there.
[154:32.14]Helms deep, helms deep, helms deep.
[154:34.20]Coming up.
[154:35.92]The breached wall.
[154:38.04]We're so close.
[154:49.27]Game's pretty short.
[154:50.13]Yeah, I could finish it.
[154:53.25]Unless I get stuck in
[154:56.31]Dump a bottle of beef jerky on me.
[155:03.90]We could not let these creatures reach the refugees.
[155:21.91]Seamless.
[155:22.67]Alright, now at least I have friends.
[155:28.51]Don't pick up that health.
[155:34.38]Not yet.
[155:34.74]I'm alone again.
[155:42.70]Great.
[156:03.64]That bad Yeah What Didn't hurt
[156:37.09]Okay.
[156:37.65]Get up.
[156:41.56]Well.
[156:42.94]Get.
[156:43.46]Roll.
[156:43.86]Dodge.
[156:44.22]Do anything.
[156:46.00]And literally do anything.
[156:47.96]Jump.
[156:48.80]Dodge.
[156:49.74]X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. They gave up.
[157:03.21]Now I'll kill that one.
[157:07.97]Oh, it's a boss.
[157:08.77]I understand.
[157:11.95]Where is he?
[157:15.20]Come here.
[157:19.64]Does that mean... get in?
[157:33.89]Ah.
[157:35.29]I heard this guy.
[157:41.94]I have to hit him.
[157:50.01]I did.
[157:50.27]He blocked it.
[157:50.77]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[158:07.18]I'm dead.
[158:19.97]Uh... At least it's right here.
[158:28.82]That's one thing that makes me happy.
[158:29.84]You have failed.
[158:57.83]Alright again, we'll do it again we'll do it again make it quick So I said to dodge around until he goes up in the air and then hit him in the belly Make them fear the wolves of Isengard
[159:20.76]This boss has kind of a gimmick.
[159:21.80]You have to get his health to zero before he'll die.
[159:23.83]Oh, okay.
[159:26.05]I'm not gonna pick up any health either.
[159:35.04]Well, I might have to.
[159:48.94]Alright, come here.
[159:50.54]Wait till he moves around to a point where I can hit him in the stomach.
[159:55.00]We'll try that.
[160:02.15]Go up, in the air.
[160:07.17]There it is!
[160:19.76]Charge.
[160:21.04]Oops.
[160:28.99]That didn't hit.
[160:39.52]Go in the air so I can hit you.
[160:42.38]Yeah.
[160:42.70]No.
[160:43.16]You don't go in first.
[160:44.04]You wait.
[160:45.44]Please don't stun lock me forever.
[160:51.07]Did the health just despawn?
[160:52.89]It did.
[161:12.56]Kill that one!
[161:13.94]Thanks for the health.
[161:21.50]Go in the air.
[161:23.78]Go in the air.
[161:24.12]You're pissing me off.
[161:34.56]Try Lord of the Rings Conquest.
[161:36.69]Is that the RTS?
[161:47.37]No, it's not.
[161:47.91]Okay.
[161:52.28]Come at me.
[161:57.43]Alright, I'm gonna hit you one more time.
[162:05.65]It's like Battlefront.
[162:09.56]Why do I know what you're talking about?
[162:10.68]I feel like I've played it or heard of it before.
[162:19.85]It's Battlefront 2 on Lord of the Rings.
[162:21.36]That sounds awesome!
[162:30.16]You gotta be kidding me.
[162:30.92]Look at that HP.
[162:31.44]Please have help.
[162:34.97]Thank you.
[162:52.79]I win.
[162:56.75]Your people were defended, but we paid for it with many lives.
[163:02.50]I nearly lost my own.
[163:04.10]Play the MMO.
[163:07.46]Was that the whole level?
[163:16.17]So it is that by various paths we have all come to the fortress of Helm's Deep to make a final stand.
[163:26.22]Okay.
[163:28.88]Well, that was the quickest level so far.
[163:31.34]I can upgrade Gimli's health.
[163:40.01]We're at Helm's Deep.
[163:48.90]We need more health.
[163:51.12]Max health increase.
[163:53.22]Let's see, what else can I do?
[163:55.04]Not at level 6 yet.
[163:56.00]I need... Bane.
[164:00.75]Cool.
[164:02.65]Health, health, health.
[164:04.67]Better axe.
[164:10.43]Road of protection.
[164:12.89]Charge attack, maybe?
[164:13.69]I'm gonna hold on to it, I think.
[164:20.84]Yeah.
[164:24.40]Hmm.
[164:29.08]Let's get it.
[164:31.04]That's an instant kill.
[164:42.31]Tremor, you are a strong, burnt-out dwarf.
[164:44.29]I love it.
[164:44.85]The ring is stealing your soul.
[164:46.41]I'm alright now.
[164:48.61]This is before I...
[164:52.75]It was the tree bosses what sapped me.
[165:03.45]The Deeping Wall.
[165:05.71]Helm's Deep.
[165:07.35]This is why I got this game.
[165:09.83]For this string of two or three levels in particular.
[165:12.33]This is why I got it.
[165:27.61]Where is the horse and the rider?
[165:31.99]Where is the horn that was blown?
[165:36.07]They have passed like rain on the mountains, like wind in the meadow.
[165:44.26]The days have gone down in the west, behind the hills, into shadow.
[165:59.83]You know what I wish there was?
[166:13.92]How come we have street addresses, right?
[166:17.62]Why don't we have... fantasy names and video game names and movie names for our street address?
[166:28.48]How come there's not, like, 22 Gondor Lane?
[166:34.24]Or, like... 621 Super Mario Boulevard.
[166:42.91]That's kind of cool.
[166:43.59]Wouldn't it be cool?
[166:50.26]Skyrim Street.
[167:05.07]You're a fucking dork I'm, sorry, but if I lived on legolas lane You don't think that that would be cool wait and that's still only conscious one What do I have to do Oh, well that was just our water for the week sorry
[167:37.52]Do I have to kick the things down?
[167:50.99]Left side, left side, left side, left side, left side!
[167:59.81]Left side!
[168:01.61]Hold on, have we already been overrun?
[168:14.30]I can't see, this rain is blocking my view.
[168:28.11]I just lost.
[168:37.02]Kick the ladders.
[168:38.06]I tried to hit the ladders.
[168:39.24]I actually have to kick them, not swing at them.
[168:44.21]When we kick him, I swung at him with my axe.
[168:51.72]This is a bad way for the movie to end.
[168:58.53]My girlfriend started playing Skyrim.
[168:59.99]She would be so happy if you streamed it.
[169:03.57]No, I'd made too many monsters.
[169:04.91]I can't play it.
[169:17.44]Okay, right.
[169:18.92]I tried to swing at him.
[169:38.15]Move.
[169:39.85]I'm the ladder guy.
[169:42.62]By the way, why can't you guys do this?
[169:44.24]Why does it have to be me?
[169:53.15]Stop saying that's because I'm gonna say it a bunch of times now
[170:29.72]Stop doing that.
[170:31.42]Watch out!
[170:52.69]There's so many fucking ladders.
[170:55.41]This is all I can do is be the guy that knocks the ladders down.
[171:00.29]They'll sing songs about me.
[171:13.74]Please.
[171:36.61]Put him down!
[171:42.62]Move out of my fucking way!
[172:12.07]Don't even fight.
[172:12.53]There's no reason to fight.
[172:13.45]Don't fight.
[172:15.82]Only hit ladders.
[172:16.48]That's it.
[172:19.92]Don't do anything else.
[172:39.11]When does this end?
[172:42.58]How long was the Helm's Deep Battles?
[172:44.08]You guys are in the way.
[172:47.58]It lasted for two movies.
[173:02.36]Well, I mean, just the battle sequence at the gates.
[173:15.50]Alright, after these two I'm going to fight.
[173:27.76]Alright, let me help.
[173:32.09]Let me help out the fight.
[173:35.15]Good.
[173:36.97]I killed one guy.
[173:39.93]It was worth it.
[173:45.58]I thought you said this was the good part of the game.
[173:53.50]Yeah, it is.
[173:55.20]This is the part... This is the part... Okay.
[174:09.22]Un-fucking-believable.

[174:39.90]I'm just being body blocked.
[174:42.12]Oh my god.
[174:42.96]You can't even remotely be serious.
[174:47.97]Did I forget this part?
[174:51.17]I lost.
[174:56.97]If I don't run in a circle and hit every ladder, I lose.
[175:00.84]But if I don't kill anything, I lose.
[175:08.04]What?
[175:18.68]Just win.
[175:21.12]Knock down every single ladder or lose.
[175:25.50]But kill them though.
[175:27.04]Please, kill them.
[175:28.21]Hurry.
[175:33.85]I got two.
[175:35.85]They're enough for us both, Gimli.
[175:58.06]You know, I wish I could delete all the people standing up there.
[176:01.02]How many times have these fucking golden motherfuckers just been in the way?
[176:05.00]And I just walk into them.
[176:09.86]I would rather just run around and do this.
[176:20.93]You need these guys.
[176:21.96]Well, can they just stand in a different spot?
[176:41.55]Get out of the way!
[177:15.39]I should play fucking Betty Hill music.
[177:39.86]What a great place for a fucking torch.
[177:46.27]Right in the way.
[178:15.03]Kill!
[178:15.72]Kill him!
[178:24.32]Oh god, get out of the fucking way.
[178:30.63]Why even have collision?
[178:32.57]With these motherfuckers, I swear to god.
[178:55.44]move move move move move move move move move move move
[179:19.33]I chose the joke character.
[179:21.05]This is not the joke character.
[179:22.43]This is Gimli of... Wherever he's from.
[179:28.76]I don't know.
[179:29.18]There's fucking so many people over here.
[179:53.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, man.
[180:08.24]No.
[180:24.27]Do you have to swing an extra fucking time?
[180:27.57]Get out of the way.
[180:36.54]Oh my god, there's a fucking million people.
[180:51.03]How is this even possible with one person?
[181:16.36]What the fuck?
[181:21.91]Oh my god, man.
[181:23.16]I bought the game because of this one mission.
[181:37.56]The game where you run around and shove ladders down for 12 minutes.
[181:41.66]And they just get overrun because you don't have a second player.
[182:03.66]Alright, this is the one.
[182:09.66]Third time's the charm.
[182:10.36]Let's go.
[182:11.28]No more fucking around.
[182:12.14]I'm doing this.
[182:13.49]This is the last one.
[182:15.11]I'm doing it.
[182:55.68]Kill.
[182:56.72]Move.
[183:00.56]This is like the game algorithm AIO.
[183:02.21]I can't even read that.
[183:05.87]And they all have shields, so I have to use this triangle.
[183:08.31]I don't have any combos with triangle.
[183:12.89]All these motherfuckers come up here with shields.
[183:43.03]It's hard to even tell what the fuck is going on right now.
[183:48.20]I don't even know who's on the screen.
[183:50.28]I don't even know where my character... Where's my character?
[184:07.92]I wanna throw this fucking guy off the edge.
[184:09.47]I wanna push that guy off the edge.
[184:11.49]I wanna throw him off the edge.
[184:12.85]Grab him by the jeans and his shirt and fucking throw him off.
[184:55.89]In the house!
[185:23.56]Every single fucking one of you has to have a goddamn shield on.
[185:28.72]Look at this mess over here.
[185:30.11]I can't just bring a combo together because none of these motherfuckers got shields.
[185:59.26]You're just trying to fucking block me, bro!
[186:27.01]They have to die!
[186:39.12]They have to die or it's over!
[187:09.61]Oh, don't worry don't bite me everybody got a shield I'm gonna lose my mind Oh
[188:01.00]I can't.
[188:27.96]Yeah, that's it.
[188:29.00]That has to be it.
[188:29.92]That's it.
[188:30.30]That has to be the end.
[188:43.37]It really makes you feel like you're part of the movie.
[188:49.57]This is what real war is like.
[189:06.35]Every ladder is back, guys!
[189:08.69]Every ladder is back!
[189:12.56]I can't even move!
[189:23.06]Kill everybody, please!
[189:30.05]Hit us all!
[189:31.33]Stay in front of everybody!
[189:32.97]Hit us all, please!
[189:38.93]Oh my god, I can't even do a fucking combo I'm gonna lose Oh my god, oh my god I just broke something
[190:10.22]Legolas is dead.
[190:13.40]Oh, not my GoXLR.
[190:14.93]It's brand new.
[190:43.47]You don't understand.
[190:44.31]I have to do triangle because it's the only thing that breaks the shield.
[190:48.09]If you don't do triangle, you can't hit the enemies.
[190:52.87]Oh my god, this is so fucking ridiculous, guys.
[190:56.16]I got two.
[190:59.98]There are enough for us both, Gimli.
[191:03.32]Take down that ladder before we're overrun!
[191:25.75]Just stay in the middle.
[191:31.21]Ignore middle ladders.
[191:32.39]They're too much work.
[191:35.13]We're gonna get overrun!
[191:42.58]We're just one person.
[191:44.96]Far middle.
[191:45.60]Don't ever go right.
[191:47.16]It's already overrun.
[191:52.08]Leave center ladders up.
[191:53.10]Funnel enemies through choke points.
[191:57.73]You gotta be fucking- look at that mess!
[192:00.57]There's so many in the middle!
[192:14.65]No, it's over.
[192:16.29]It's over.
[192:19.19]It's over.
[192:32.46]It's in +2.
[192:33.22]Hey, why are you not doing combos?
[192:34.56]It's kind of even hard to see how I'm swinging the axe.
[192:42.95]Move.
[192:55.28]I can't believe you got fucking through.
[193:06.18]Check the game boomer tips.
[193:25.21]Good knockdown.
[193:26.19]I don't hate you anymore.
[193:44.86]Why do you have to do it twice?
[193:45.92]Like, I didn't even press it.
[193:47.08]I didn't press the button.
[193:53.61]Fuck the middle right now.
[193:57.49]Like, I blended him in the background.
[194:19.45]That didn't hit.
[194:24.47]Get the fuck out of the way.
[194:27.84]Teleporting run.
[194:32.54]This guy's still alive.
[194:45.38]Kick the ladders first, then come...
[194:49.55]This is like the ultimate backseat-able experience.
[194:52.23]Because on your screen, it's just kick the ladders down, dude!
[194:56.67]Kill the guys!
[194:57.66]Kick the ladders down!
[194:59.08]Scratch your head!
[194:59.90]Fluck your eyebrows!
[195:10.93]Use your blinker!
[195:24.13]Fucking go!
[195:34.28]That didn't kill him?
[195:35.24]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[195:40.48]Dude, Gimli, it takes you forever to swing.
[195:44.98]It takes Gimli a hundred fucking years to swing exactly.
[195:59.02]It's all It's over it's over it's over there they're flooding the middle I didn't get I didn't get yeah Look how many fucking people are up there
[196:30.96]This is fucking insane.
[196:34.35]How did any 12 year old us do this?
[196:40.77]How did we do this when we were like 16?
[196:42.97]There's no way I would have done this when I was like fucking 13.
[197:27.44]I need to farm XP now.
[197:31.12]Where's Aro- Alright.
[197:33.24]We're going- Where's a good farm level?
[197:37.72]What's a farm level?
[197:38.46]I'm not playing this game really anymore.
[197:43.86]What did I unlock here?
[197:48.57]Wait, that's actually John Ray's- Really?
[197:52.69]I have to level the other characters.
[197:55.39]He's too stout and small.
[197:58.75]What's a good one to do?
[198:00.21]I'm not watching the Gimli interview until they beat the fucking game.
[198:03.06]I am so burning up right now.
[198:05.86]Alright.
[198:36.46]Gameboomers.com.
[198:38.14]Lord of the Rings.
[198:38.98]Here it is.
[198:41.15]What the fuck is this?
[198:43.13]This is a... I thought I just got my computer hacked to click on that.
[198:58.28]This is unreadable.
[198:59.84]I can't even read this.
[199:02.30]This is what I feel like it looks like if you put an entire book on my screen at the same time.
[199:07.80]A whole book.
[199:09.77]It's just every inch of my screen.
[199:14.73]Alright, let's see.
[199:15.47]Let's look at... Alright, let's see.
[199:24.88]Let's put it on the screen.
[199:36.67]Text.
[199:37.55]Let's do... I think I broke it.
[199:52.76]You can see this.
[199:56.21]Font size.
[199:56.85]I think I crashed my OBS.
[200:07.79]Just put it in text-to-speech.
[200:12.74]I don't think I can even... There's too much here to put in text-to-speech.
[200:20.86]What's that website that I can do it to?
[200:27.10]I don't... It's too big.
[200:37.23]Type Helm's Deep.
[200:39.02]Alright, find Helm's Deep.
[200:44.42]Helm... This is not in the right guide.
[200:49.17]Yeah, this is an incorrect guide.
[200:50.59]Helm's Deep is not even on here.
[200:53.01]Oh, no, yeah, it is.
[200:53.57]Now, Helm's Deep.
[200:54.57]Okay.
[200:54.83]I don't think this is the right guide.
[201:13.85]No.
[201:15.03]No, this is incorrect.
[201:16.55]Plus, all these text-to-speech sites cut off after, like, 150 characters.
[201:24.38]It's the second two towns.
[201:25.84]Wait, lord, is this actually correct?
[201:37.09]No, it's not.
[201:38.69]Let me just bomb for a little bit.
[201:47.51]This is for the Game Boy version.
[201:54.44]I've played like four hours on Gimli and I don't even know the fuck I'm doing now.
[202:30.66]I don't know, man.
[202:32.53]I might just delete the game.
[202:34.53]I'm thinking about it.
[202:36.07]I'm thinking about just opening up the PlayStation 2 and turning the stream on.
[202:43.16]Okay.
[202:50.24]Like 60% levels of take disk out of prey.
[202:53.28]It's like 65% I think.
[202:54.50]Grinding.
[203:22.93]Aragorn's broken just abuse his stuff Do you know what I hate about this you can't tell if they're dead on the ground or just lying on the ground I mean, there's like no I don't even know if there's not gonna get up enough.
[203:49.65]I
[204:01.28]Yeah, but when you're surrounded by people, who knows if it's the guy behind you or the guy in front of you that died.
[204:28.89]You're gonna stop me in the middle of that how dare you
[205:04.13]I'm so over it.
[205:09.05]I'm so over it.
[205:25.33]I'm so over it.
[205:45.00]Why am I reloading the game?
[205:46.38]Well, because the last Helm's Deep level is deemed to be impossible with my current character.
[205:52.02]I don't know if that's the way I'm playing.
[205:54.18]No, you know what?
[205:54.92]Let's play.
[205:59.74]Get back on Gimli and get the back in fucking Helm's Deep.
[206:02.63]No, not... Give me a minute.
[206:08.29]Steal yourself!
[206:27.06]What do you mean completed?
[206:30.10]What do you mean completed?
[206:55.53]I can't do it.
[206:56.07]Wait, I cannot do this with Gimli?
[207:30.48]I got two.
[207:32.46]They're enough for us both, Gimli.
[207:35.80]Take down that ladder before we're overrun!
[207:37.78]I didn't even want to do that.
[207:52.33]Fucking R2.
[208:27.54]Buy the jeans!
[208:28.64]Buy the jeans off the cliff.
[208:42.68]The orcs are upon the wall!
[209:05.93]I love 12 FPS as well.
[209:07.81]What a great experience.
[209:09.55]True classic.
[210:06.66]I didn't.
[210:07.29]I was like, I'm fucking getting up still.
[210:10.41]Why is that fucking guy getting up still?
[210:12.94]Just early to fucking axe his head.
[210:36.08]Open way.
[211:12.40]Stop!
[211:13.32]Oh, the controls make me want to puke in my mouth.
[211:26.05]He's already dead!
[212:14.60]You can't be serious man.
[212:29.70]Fuck the middle for now.
[212:30.68]I gotta...
[212:38.48]throw axes it takes like three seconds to throw an axe guys it's not gonna work oh it's over
[213:09.85]I think this is the level where I gave up as a child.
[213:13.13]Nobody beat this by themselves.
[213:15.90]I don't think it's possible.
[213:22.92]Nobody did.
[213:25.42]Where are the Steam trophies for this one?
[213:29.71]It's gonna be gray across every single United States of A. I'm only gonna kick ladders down.
[213:48.57]I got two.
[213:50.59]They're enough for us both, Gimli.
[213:53.89]Take down that ladder before we're overrun!
[214:27.23]Why can't you motherfuckers do this too?
[215:00.53]I came up here because I knew that was going to happen.
[215:59.74]Damn it!
[216:00.22]I didn't get it before they fucking came up with this shit!
[216:02.78]Fucking every goddamn fucking angle!
[216:30.65]Get why is my character turning around?
[216:37.01]What the fuck is going on right now get up Oh my god, this is this is this is close I have to go up here
[217:19.31]Better be dead finish the job.
[217:22.65]Oh you Fuck Finish the job and don't Jerma sounds like a supervillain.
[217:45.64]I am right now.
[217:46.46]I
[218:00.93]You fucking tiny little motherfucker.
[218:02.95]I swear to God you can't even swing at anybody with it by fate of you Hold the axe by the bottom of the handle Gimli not the top.
[218:11.38]Oh
[218:35.49]Unbelievable.
[218:36.47]Are you seeing that shit?
[218:39.27]Are you seeing this shit?
[218:42.30]Are you seeing this shit?
[218:45.98]I can't go to the ladders with these people.
[218:49.40]This is un-fucking-believable.
[219:03.15]This is not possible.
[219:04.82]I can't do it.
[219:06.30]I can't do it.
[219:06.90]This is fucking the hardest thing I've ever done.
[219:11.08]All the guys have the level around 10.
[219:12.54]This motherfucker's level 5!
[219:16.44]He's level 5!
[219:18.26]And I can't do any of the levels with him!
[219:48.02]Am I gonna do it again?
[219:48.88]I don't even know if I can physically do this.
[219:53.54]Set up a TAS bot.
[219:56.68]I don't think they'd be able to do that.
[220:00.63]Can I not play the other levels?
[220:13.37]Why can't I replay these?
[220:29.90]These are photos.
[220:35.96]I have to beat the game with somebody?
[220:38.80]What do they say?
[220:39.80]What do the guides say?
[220:41.98]Lord of... I don't remember this being this ridiculous.
[220:49.57]The next level's worse than this.
[220:52.63]Is it?
[220:59.64]I'm going, Legolas.
[221:07.26]Jesus Christ.
[221:10.10]I don't remember it being like this.
[221:13.64]It's time to grind?
[221:14.80]I don't want to grind.
[221:16.10]I want to beat it.
[221:19.56]It's gonna just get worse.
[221:26.71]What's a level that I can reliably... Push the ladders, baby.
[221:40.12]Ignore combat 100% completely.
[221:42.14]Don't hit anyone.
[221:44.20]Do not hit anyone.
[221:46.06]Just only do ladders.
[221:47.16]But I am gonna get overrun.
[221:49.78]You're swinging at air.
[221:51.36]It's hard.
[221:52.14]The game's controls are hard.
[221:54.46]Kick the ladders only in the middle.
[221:55.88]That's not going to work.
[221:56.80]I'll try it.
[222:07.18]Kick ladders only in the middle?
[222:09.16]Stay in the middle.
[222:10.62]Okay.
[222:11.97]Are you okay?
[222:14.47]I'm in a little bit of trouble.
[222:19.84]I'm only going to kick the ladders in the middle.
[222:23.04]Is that the worst idea ever?
[222:27.60]Kick all ladders.
[222:28.39]I don't want to hear this.
[222:31.91]I don't want to hear that anymore.
[222:35.71]I'm sick of hearing it.
[223:00.49]Okay, I'm only gonna knock down the middle ladders.
[223:06.91]I have time though.
[223:08.00]That's not a good idea.
[223:32.95]Stick to the plan.
[223:33.73]Stick to the plan.
[223:34.93]Stick to the plan.
[223:36.17]Stick to the plan.
[223:37.75]What was the plan?
[223:39.15]What was the plan?
[223:39.93]Only ladders in the middle?
[223:41.41]What was the plan?
[223:45.04]Only ladders.
[223:45.60]Throw axes.
[223:46.64]No ladders.
[223:47.58]Or axe.
[223:49.20]What?
[223:49.84]What do you mean?
[223:55.10]Where am I throwing the axes at?
[223:59.94]Am I doing it right?
[224:08.30]The plan.
[224:08.76]Stick to the plan.
[224:09.22]Stick to the plan.
[224:10.67]Axe move.
[224:11.31]What?
[224:11.65]No.
[224:12.03]No.
[224:12.29]The axe move takes like five seconds to charge up.
[224:14.35]It's not going to work.
[224:29.95]You take ten seconds to kill a guy in melee.
[224:33.80]I think you severely underestimate how hard it is to play this game.
[224:38.69]Like I said, you can sit there and go, Wow, he's fucking stupid.
[224:41.47]What a dumb motherfucker.
[224:42.55]I hope he shits his pants.
[224:44.35]Swing him with his axe.
[224:46.15]It's hard.
[225:25.68]I'm not ignoring the left.
[225:26.44]I have time to do one Okay, now I'm gonna ignore it Six shots up
[225:55.67]Aragorn, come on.
[226:12.41]You're supposed to be the best player.
[226:35.18]Get over there!
[226:35.76]Get over there!
[226:37.26]They made it in!
[226:38.00]They made it in!
[226:38.80]This guy didn't finish the fucking job, mate!
[227:02.15]Finish the fucking... Finish the job, Aragorn!
[227:05.41]He finished the job, thank god.
[227:07.39]What a legend.
[227:14.04]Sorry, I flew off the the handle there.
[227:15.32]You did, you finished the job.
[227:17.60]It's these elf... It's the elves that just stand around and look at stuff.
[227:24.16]And swing and fucking miss over and over again.
[227:26.05]What are you, me?
[227:50.64]Ignore entire left side it actually seems like it's working out Imagine ignoring the entire left left side and that's what you had to do imagine There's so many ladders Why don't we uh, here's an idea guys.
[228:09.73]Why don't you dump gasoline?
[228:12.37]Where they're putting the ladders down and drop a match
[228:16.89]Why not?
[228:17.31]You just start dropping anvils over the edge.
[228:22.14]Go wire up a Pianos and drop them over the edge.
[228:45.49]Okay, here we go, here we go!
[228:53.02]Just sit there and drop anvilss.
[228:56.44]Just have a guy being a fu- Huh?
[228:59.34]Huh, guys?
[228:59.94]Oh, fuck.
[229:00.98]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[229:09.06]Um.
[229:13.11]I just got hit in the fuckin' head with a boulder!
[229:18.75]I got hit by a boulder in the head!
[229:21.19]I got hit right in the fuckin' head by a boulder!
[229:30.32]Stick to the plan!
[229:31.76]I can't even stick to the plan, there's too many!
[229:34.20]There's too many!
[229:52.85]So they shoot boulders.
[229:54.73]Bar goes immediately to red.
[229:57.61]Game over.
[230:02.17]The top The top YouTube search I just watched this... What does it say?
[230:14.36]So the top YouTube search I just watched for this mission is from 2015.
[230:17.43]Doing basically the same thing you're doing by focusing the ladders.
[230:20.23]They don't get swarmed nearly as much as you, so I, I have, as you have, so I hate to say that I think you're just getting unlucky.
[230:31.70]No, I'm not getting unlucky.
[230:33.52]Alright, only ladders.
[230:34.96]Okay, every time I swing the axe, I give 10 community subs.
[231:04.45]He's faking his own hype train.
[231:08.07]Move out of the fucking way!
[231:10.43]That was a good start too, but it was ruined by the standing people.
[231:42.04]They're trying to get in my way.
[231:43.64]It's like they're trying to get in my way.
[231:56.36]We're playing football now.
[232:20.11]I didn't swing no swinging I Did this game when I was nine the lies lies lies surrounded by lies surrounded by them I
[233:05.08]I wonder if Jerma still likes Lord of the Rings after this.
[233:07.53]Yeah, it's a pretty good series.
[233:40.17]Alright, come on two on the right don't I hosted So I was waiting for this shit I don't care.
[234:06.52]I don't care.
[234:06.88]I don't care.
[234:07.16]I have to kill this guy.
[234:07.78]I
[234:41.16]I had to kill the guy, I really did.
[234:55.52]That's not a swing, that's a push.
[234:56.66]That was a push, not a swing.
[234:57.74]That was a push.
[234:59.10]Don't twist it.
[235:19.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[235:26.72]No.
[235:29.00]No, the yellow bar.
[235:31.12]No, no.
[235:32.38]Ah.
[235:42.57]Ice these motherfuckers!
[235:45.21]Come on, ice them!
[235:45.87]Ice them, Aragorn!
[235:46.91]This body's in the way!
[236:22.24]Aragorn, ice these motherfuckers, please.
[236:28.10]Ice these motherfuckers.
[236:39.78]Wasn't there a part three that's supposed to happen here, like, right now?
[236:45.03]Wasn't there supposed to be a part three that happens right now?
[236:48.21]Why is this taking so long?
[236:59.49]Okay, here we go.
[237:01.13]Only ladders.
[237:01.91]Just knock down the ladders.
[237:06.51]Here we go.
[237:09.43]It's gonna instantly turn red.
[237:15.53]I said 30 community subs.
[237:18.00]I'm trying to push the ladder, you fucking dick.
[237:21.74]Just push it down, man.
[237:23.46]I got stun locked.
[237:27.54]I got stunlocked.
[237:28.72]I am about to... Oh my god, I got stunlocked by this fucking motherfucker right next to me.
[237:37.67]Oh my god.
[237:40.49]It's... This is the worst.
[237:44.25]Look at how many people are up here.
[237:46.89]There's no way I'm gonna be doing this.
[237:49.85]There's no way.
[237:50.77]I can't even do that.
[237:53.27]Is anybody gonna kill somebody up here?
[238:14.47]So, it came back and I got stunlocked.
[238:19.05]By the way, is...
[238:22.36]Is there, in the most celebrated franchise in human history, is there a reason why catapults launch and then the bar fills to red in eight seconds?
[238:45.93]How did actual Gimli do this?
[239:00.25]This is based on history.
[239:03.09]I wonder, how did they do this back a thousand years ago?
[239:10.93]Guys, I don't know.
[239:13.85]I'm supposed to stick to the plan, but let's be completely honest.
[239:17.31]I'm not sure that plan's... I'm not sure it's a sound plan anymore.
[239:30.22]the furthest we've made it we make it to there every time and then everybody just there's a thousand people on the screen try the left instead where is the horse I should have just built up aragorn I shouldn't have to do that
[240:33.20]I'm just here for the free sub.
[240:35.02]Well, what is it, at 30?
[240:44.88]This area, okay, this area needs, this area needs to be over-tweeted.
[240:49.22]It needs to be under-tweeted.
[240:50.96]This area needs to be over-tweeted.
[240:53.69]It needs to be under-tweeted.
[241:02.46]How is the right- left side been doing that poorly?
[241:04.56]I have enough time to get left.
[241:09.60]At least the first one.
[241:18.88]That's team one.
[241:26.62]Why is it already dead?
[241:29.49]It's like every time there's a cutscene, the game continues to load the enemies in.
[241:34.67]That's what's happening.
[241:36.80]Whenever we see a cutscene, it's still loading ladders and people in.
[241:52.08]Remember, the ladders don't matter.
[241:53.08]It's the amount of orcs on the wall.
[241:55.24]Yeah, but if this ladder is up, I can't kill them.
[241:59.37]You get completely overrun.
[242:01.29]What's supposed to happen is player A runs around and hits ladders and stays on the left side, and player B runs around on the right side and hits ladders and kills enemies on the right side.
[242:16.24]My player B is standing over here swinging at the same two orcs.
[242:25.97]I don't even have another controller to plug in.
[242:28.49]I fucked it up.
[242:32.84]I fucked it up.
[242:45.81]No, it's okay.
[242:46.25]It's salvageable.
[242:48.57]That spawn right next to me on the right salvaged everything.
[243:07.07]Right at the middle.
[243:14.69]Left side, right side.
[243:15.29]Here it comes.
[243:17.35]Ready?
[243:17.81]1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.
[243:18.17]Come on.
[243:21.78]Oh my god.
[243:25.18]It's just a game.
[243:26.02]It's just a football game.
[243:28.12]It really is.
[243:28.66]There's three or four of them on the screen at the same time.
[243:32.34]And they take up almost all of the real estate on screen.
[243:42.77]Do the left side if you have time.
[243:43.83]I'm not sure I ever will.
[243:50.88]First time I've fallen.
[243:51.74]Because that guy backed up.
[243:53.64]Look, see?
[243:54.00]He's doing a great job walking around.
[243:55.36]I'm going to be collapsed on.
[244:18.20]is toxic to teammates.
[244:21.28]Well, tell them to push a ladder down.
[244:25.61]Even if they did it once.
[244:27.91]If one of these AI pushed one ladder to the ground.
[244:33.42]One.
[244:34.48]I'd probably be...
[244:44.75]Why is this this there's so many people up here right now, but I'm not I don't understand why only two ladders are up Fuck that's that doesn't count that was a recovery God damn it.
[245:08.53]I just got so screwed.
[245:09.63]Oh
[245:11.60]The left side... I can't... Is the left side done?
[245:17.86]The left side might be fucking toast.
[245:33.97]Push the ladder.
[245:34.91]Oh my god.
[245:36.96]Block.
[245:37.48]That's a block.
[245:38.00]That was a block.
[245:40.60]Seriously.
[245:41.54]Seriously, there's so many people on the screen that you can't even walk to the ladders.
[245:47.51]These are blocks.
[245:48.39]These are blocks.
[246:11.04]I'm gonna watch.
[246:11.60]Is there a speedrunner?
[246:12.20]Has anyone played this fucking game to a point where they want to speedrun this painful shit?
[246:18.70]Two towers.
[246:20.26]Helm's Deep speedrun.
[246:22.84]How the fuck does anyone reliably do this?
[246:24.76]Let's see.
[246:29.32]I want to see this.
[246:31.63]Skip to Helm's Deep.
[246:37.19]What the hell did they even do?
[246:49.36]It's okay if it's too hard, Jermall.
[246:53.64]I just want to see.
[246:55.01]I guarantee you.
[246:56.77]Who wants to make some bets here?
[246:58.75]I'll make a bet with you.
[247:00.21]This is a speed run of this game.
[247:01.83]In 47 minutes, I guarantee you, I will gift another 10 subs if during this, this guy doesn't go, stupid fucking part of the game.
[247:10.28]You ready?
[247:11.02]Ready?
[247:45.32]This is all wrong.
[247:48.42]Oh, that's why it's doing that.
[247:49.32]Okay.
[247:50.99]Right.
[247:51.31]Makes sense.
[247:52.09]Okay.
[248:26.97]Right.
[248:27.39]Look at how- look at how- right now he's going the fuck out of the way.
[248:38.20]There's no mic.
[248:47.78]He goes left too, guys.
[248:48.74]He goes left.
[248:50.24]He doesn't- he goes left.
[248:57.99]He has not swung the sword once so far.
[249:09.16]He just... I feel like I'm doing this faster than this.
[249:37.66]Wait, in order of... What do you mean in order?
[249:41.18]Is he fasting?
[249:42.23]Is he faster running animation?
[249:44.87]Don't even tell me that's what it is.
[249:46.35]No, it's not.
[249:52.21]Wait, Gimli has a slower running... Gimli is actually a slower character?
[250:04.58]No, no way.
[250:05.68]I don't believe that for a second.
[250:22.20]100% you ignore the left two ladders.
[250:29.31]I feel like I'm doing it the same way.
[250:32.53]I'm doing it the same way.
[250:34.23]No, he's not ignoring the other ladder.
[250:35.67]This is like the world record holder.
[250:40.53]He's taking out the two left.
[250:47.21]But that's a Legolas?
[250:48.79]No, it's not.
[250:49.30]Legolas doesn't have a two-handed sword.
[251:02.24]He's doing it in a predetermined order.
[251:10.41]So should I just be doing it as they pop up?
[251:13.13]Alright, so let's see.
[251:14.03]The Rite just popped up right there.
[251:16.29]Does he run all the way across to the right side?
[251:21.86]He does.
[251:23.26]He's doing them in the order that they're popping up.
[251:26.18]Is it?
[251:26.88]Yeah.
[251:27.54]He skipped that other one.
[251:31.35]No, see what just happened there?
[251:36.61]He's doing it in the order they pop up, not in the order that they're in the way.
[251:39.15]No, he's not?
[251:48.09]He's just doing the closest one.
[251:52.84]He's not.
[251:53.32]Middle was up for ages.
[251:54.60]He's just knocking them down as they pop up.
[252:00.06]I swear to God, if it's because Gimli is like 7% slower, I'm gonna be real angry.
[252:28.62]He upgraded the character.
[252:29.74]Gimli's upgraded too.
[252:32.18]There's no speed upgrade.
[252:39.38]There are two ladders near each other.
[252:40.72]He goes there instead of wasting time going all the way down the middle.
[252:44.02]So... He's generally doing them as they pop up.
[252:49.64]Alright, I'm going Aragorn.
[252:53.78]I'm going to try it.
[252:54.44]Let's go.
[252:56.84]I think I got it.
[253:03.39]I think I got it.
[253:04.21]I'm going Aragorn.
[253:23.08]Boys and girls, you ready?
[253:25.34]Let's go.
[253:39.82]Check the description on the video.
[253:41.02]There's no fucking way this person's watching this stream.
[253:43.16]Where is the horse and the rider?
[253:47.56]Where is the horn that is playing?
[253:52.84]I got two.
[253:53.42]There are enough for us both, Gimli.
[254:04.09]He's way faster.
[254:06.13]He's way faster than Gimli.
[254:18.82]It's not even a fucking contest.
[254:34.16]You gotta be kidding me.
[254:36.09]Did I seriously waste all that fucking time because I was playing as the character that was a little bit slower than everybody else?
[254:42.44]No way.
[254:43.04]Is this like a placebo effect?
[255:04.48]I feel like there's like five times as many people on the screen.
[255:07.68]Am I getting placebo'd?
[255:08.30]Um.
[255:31.90]This just feels just different.
[255:37.15]Like, this just feels different to me.
[255:39.03]I don't know what drugs I'm on, but this is different.
[255:41.33]You know what I'm saying?
[255:42.00]Let's ignore the left side.
[256:08.32]I think he is faster.
[256:09.76]He is.
[256:11.00]Right?
[256:13.67]I'm not going crazy, right?
[256:29.94]Thanks for getting in my way, everybody.
[257:09.77]Come on.
[257:10.23]I need some spawns.
[257:23.50]That was incredibly inefficient.
[257:29.10]It's okay.
[257:29.80]I'm at zero bar.
[257:45.07]I swear to God, get the fuck out of my way, you punk.
[257:50.79]One guy, spinning around in goddamn circles.
[258:11.56]You're not really gonna let this fucking happen, are you?
[258:13.68]Get out of the way.
[258:23.24]How did that not hit?
[258:24.56]How did that not hit?
[258:28.52]I'm blocking.
[258:29.08]I'm not swinging.
[258:29.66]I'm blocking.
[258:30.24]I'm level two as Aragorn, guys.
[258:32.76]I can't take like two hits.
[258:45.63]Oh my fucking god.
[258:55.69]There's only three ladders up.
[258:57.01]How the fuck are there this many people out right now?
[259:08.29]Oh, God.
[259:09.07]I'm gonna fucking puke.
[259:10.39]I really am.
[259:15.72]So many people over here.
[259:16.54]I'm gonna get hit and die.
[259:21.02]Blocking is not running.
[259:27.29]When you parry, it doesn't do anything.
[259:30.23]You don't even get a second of hit recovery.
[259:32.61]You just don't take damage.
[259:33.95]It doesn't do anything else.
[259:36.15]I'm fucked.
[259:36.49]I had to do it.
[259:50.94]I'm getting a fucking run.
[259:54.06]The same shit keeps fucking happening to me.
[260:02.98]Right side, right side, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[260:04.70]Come on, Aragorn, go.
[260:19.29]Here we go.
[260:19.81]Alright, alright.
[260:20.47]No, don't fuck this up.
[260:38.45]Dammit there's so many people I'm telling you during the fucking cutscenes it continues.
[260:42.51]I'm stuck in the corner Jesus Christ give me the help Please don't you even fucking dare Being you're all body blocking right now, and it's driving me mad.
[261:06.69]I
[261:15.39]What just- What the fuck just happened?
[261:18.67]What just happened?
[261:19.74]I insta-died?
[261:21.62]I instantly fucking died?
[261:23.82]What the fuck just happened?
[261:25.38]I was trying to dodge and not get- And- And excuse- That's the first time that's ever happened?
[261:32.14]That's the first time that's ever fucking happened?
[261:34.40]I got instantly killed by- What was it?
[261:36.46]What did I die?
[261:37.04]It shot a fireball at you.
[261:38.88]I shot a fireball.
[261:39.48]Wasn't I standing behind the- I got catapulted?
[261:47.57]I... It was because I was alongside the wall?
[262:05.59]I did better that time with Aragorn.
[262:07.97]Do I really have to go back and play all these fucking levels again with this dude?
[262:15.01]I don't... Why is this nine straight minutes?
[262:26.22]I honestly don't believe you can... Should I change this to, I guarantee you won't beat Helm's Deep part one?
[262:52.52]He bought the game for this.
[262:54.56]No, I didn't.
[262:56.58]One of the best PS2 games.
[262:58.93]Yeah, I... Why don't you attack?
[263:18.18]Because it's an inefficient use of time.
[263:21.79]For some reason.
[263:23.13]And I don't know why.
[263:26.89]Attacking any orc on this cliff is an inefficient use of even one second of your time.
[263:36.86]We just watched the world record speedrun.
[263:39.62]But the dude just runs around in circles.
[263:42.54]Ten more minutes to the next height crank.
[263:45.81]The speedrunner attacked.
[263:47.01]And I also... I...
[263:51.02]We're going left.
[263:51.48]We're going right side.
[263:55.00]I just got hit directly in the head with one of those, and it didn't kill me.
[264:00.78]It was because I got hit with a giant catapult in the fucking head.
[264:14.39]Wait a minute.
[264:16.99]I think I may have unlocked the ultimate strategy.
[264:21.69]No, I didn't.
[264:22.21]Never mind.
[264:24.09]It's too sloppy to be able to do that.
[264:32.86]No, that's not gonna work.
[264:34.92]There's too much body collision to even attempt to attack a person up here.
[265:14.55]Okay, this one spawned over here, so I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going this way.
[265:19.43]Ah, stuck, stuck, stuck!
[265:22.26]Awesome!
[265:38.04]It didn't even swing.
[265:38.78]It got... The one time that the motherfucker doesn't swing for three straight seconds.
[265:43.39]Always just spinning in a circle, randomly flailing around trying to hit anything.
[265:46.73]And that one time.
[265:48.63]Am I gonna get hit by more of this shit?
[265:52.54]Am I gonna...
[266:14.28]It's been eight hours!
[266:15.08]How long am I streaming?
[266:15.67]I've been streaming for eight hours?
[266:17.79]Holy shit, I thought it was like four.
[266:27.39]Ah, I'm gonna die.
[266:30.27]I can't.
[266:31.85]I'm fucking dead.
[266:35.45]I'm dead.
[266:35.69]I wish I could see the right side of the screen right now.
[266:38.90]You know?
[266:40.58]What a fucking miracle God saw me.
[266:42.64]God did that for me.
[266:46.35]It's over.
[266:50.55]It's over.
[266:53.29]God don't care.
[266:56.90]There's only one way this is possible.
[266:59.70]We have to get... Fire has to rain down here right now.
[267:04.90]You can't physically even fucking walk.
[267:08.84]No.
[267:09.26]Speedrun done.
[267:10.16]Over.
[267:20.29]Miracle.
[267:21.40]Is there going to be a miracle?
[267:22.28]Nope.
[267:48.63]Why is it this complicated?
[267:52.19]Like, why does it have to be this ridiculous?
[267:57.45]Fuck, man.
[268:02.97]I don't even, like, I can't even comprehend it.
[268:15.09]Helm's Deep is hard.
[268:16.25]Game gotta be hard.
[268:19.21]I don't even... Alright, this is the last time I'm doing it and I'm gonna go shove a pizza in my fucking nose.
[268:26.82]You have to grind.
[268:27.48]I can't even play the other levels with another character.
[268:30.14]I was gonna go back and play... I was gonna go back and play the other levels with Gimli.
[268:33.86]I can't even do them.
[268:36.02]Gimli is forever at level 5.
[268:57.27]Was it all just spawned at the same time too?
[269:13.51]Did I try?
[269:14.01]Yeah, it's grayed out.
[269:14.67]You can't click it.
[269:15.15]I'm already going to lose.
[269:39.10]A huge wave of explosions happens here.
[269:46.58]Here, like this.
[269:47.08]Get down!
[269:48.38]Get down!
[269:56.63]They're all trying to kill me.
[270:03.69]Block.
[270:20.36]The old Jerma wouldn't give up.
[270:22.16]I didn't give up yet.
[270:23.20]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[270:24.98]I'm beating this right now.
[270:26.48]No questions asked.
[270:53.50]Get the fuck out of... What are you doing?
[270:59.14]What are you thinking?
[271:00.84]Why do they do that?
[271:01.90]Just stand still!
[271:23.85]Thanks for the help, you two.
[271:24.89]Nice work.
[271:25.97]Not.
[271:26.95]Not.
[271:27.37]What is this, fucking fourth grade, Jeremy?
[271:29.95]Get out of the fucking way.
[271:33.09]Not.
[271:46.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this way.
[271:53.14]It's just brainless fucking brainless Brainless
[272:21.99]There's just brainless weights that stand in the way.
[272:24.66]I'm telling you, I'm doing it right now.
[273:06.76]middle middle middle middle spawn middle middle middle nothing good spawn good good placement good spawn that guy should have fell off like no jokes that guy shouldn't have been up here he's a little tweaking I think
[273:48.21]Spawn right on top of me.
[273:49.19]Right on top of me!
[273:49.63]Spawn, spawn, spawn, spawn!
[273:50.53]Right here!
[273:50.97]It's okay.
[273:51.37]It's alright.
[273:51.83]It's okay.
[273:54.91]Get them all in a row.
[273:57.22]Come on, Legolas.
[273:57.64]Right in the middle.
[274:06.18]Help me, help me.
[274:06.70]Somebody help me out here!
[274:08.87]What happened there?
[274:10.91]Don't fucking blow it.
[274:14.53]Watch out for the- they're dropping.
[274:15.69]They're gonna drop the rain on me.
[274:16.53]They're gonna drop the rain on me.
[274:17.47]I need health.
[274:24.05]Gotta get down, get down!
[274:24.75]There's health right here.
[274:27.95]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I need help.
[274:30.91]What are we at, 50?
[274:31.51]Who cares?
[274:34.69]Right side, right side, right side, right side, right side, right side.
[274:47.99]Alright, fucking here we go.
[274:48.89]Come on.
[274:51.87]Don't get hit by this.
[274:55.53]All the way.
[274:56.03]Skip.
[274:56.26]I can't skip.
[274:56.80]There's no skipping.
[274:59.70]Run.
[275:09.68]Is health right over here?
[275:20.32]No, man, there's no fucking way.
[275:22.78]It's impossible.
[275:24.19]It's physically not completable.
[275:29.43]It's physically not completable.
[275:32.45]This is an incompletable encounter.
[275:35.67]Are you kidding me?
[275:38.95]Look what happened.
[275:40.11]Everything was fine.
[275:42.17]What?
[276:01.15]stage three happens and then is this even beatable do I have a broken copy of the game hey what's up Joel hey what's up everybody hey welcome to the stream I'm currently uh beating I have a bootleg broken copy of Lord of the Rings the two towers I'm at the uncompletable mission um
[276:31.47]Cool.
[276:32.15]Watch the phase 3 on speedrun.
[276:36.09]I don't want to do that again.
[276:36.97]I don't want to do what we just did again.
[276:41.83]I would rather rip all my eyebrow hairs out and eat them than do what we just did one more time.
[276:53.32]I'd rather eat corn on the cob with the husk still on than do this level again.
[277:06.35]I can't man, what do you mean watch the phase three thing?
[277:09.83]This is just so bogus.
[277:17.54]I can't even, what the fuck?
[277:21.84]Okay, let's watch the world record speed run on how to complete Helm's Deep level one.
[277:29.56]I feel bad for all the fucking 13 year olds that played this back in the day.
[277:35.07]that didn't have a YouTube speedrun of the best player in the whole entire world.
[277:38.49]But watch do this.
[277:39.67]So they can complete their game.
[277:45.55]What does he do?
[278:03.24]Phase three, phase three.
[278:04.36]Come on.
[278:08.89]Did the game drop some meteors on you?
[278:12.17]Okay, here's phase three.
[278:13.45]What the fuck?
[278:16.13]What the fuck?
[278:17.49]Dude, come on.
[278:18.49]There he goes.
[278:20.26]Kicks him down.
[278:21.06]He's doing the same damn thing.
[278:49.35]he hit that one guy why is he not taking damage alright he's not taking damage oh he just got hit by a meteor and like eight swings
[279:17.99]Even when I was on Gimli, I was taking more damage here.
[279:27.43]What's he doing?
[279:28.29]Can he hear me?
[279:39.00]It's not that far after that either.
[279:43.02]Anyways.
[279:45.01]Thanks, Joel, for the raid.
[279:45.85]Welcome, everybody.
[279:46.84]I'm currently in a little bit of a pickle.
[279:52.80]I'm trying so hard to do this.
[279:54.88]I've been streaming for eight hours.
[279:55.92]Trying to do... Oh, man, man, man.
[280:01.14]Man, man, man, man.
[280:02.62]Just don't get hit by the meteors.
[280:03.78]Just don't get hit.
[280:05.78]Oh, what time is it?
[280:06.91]It's late.
[280:07.55]It's...
[280:13.31]The gray bar underneath his health bar is his second health bar.
[280:18.01]What?
[280:22.53]He's looking at another YouTube video.
[280:24.07]No, I just like... Aragorn, I got... But is it really... Is Gimli slower?
[280:29.85]Can we please figure that out without a... No doubt at all.
[280:33.80]Is Gimli actually slower?
[280:39.34]He is.
[280:40.36]God damn it.
[280:41.20]Why did I pick Gimli?
[280:46.69]yes he is according to the wiki it feels slower I have to this level's very quick and it's just a boss and it's like 10 15 000 experience
[281:34.66]Oh, by the way, Joel, if you're watching, I'm not sure we're going to be doing a stream tomorrow.
[281:42.62]Wrong screen.
[281:43.44]I got it.
[281:45.22]Because this is going on like 8, 9, 10 hours.
[281:49.00]I'm not sure I'll be streaming tomorrow.
[281:54.06]You can see.
[282:00.63]You can see.
[282:02.40]Just give me my experience and do the health upgrades and then just run.
[282:14.80]Only Jerma stopped after the first game to defuse bombs.
[282:30.75]And there's also a certain threshold where I'm completely out of gas too.
[282:34.49]I may have already hit there.
[282:35.43]Yeah, I think I may have.
[282:36.29]I think I hit there already.
[282:41.66]He's level two.
[282:42.40]I can't do this at level two.
[282:48.16]Insult to injury.
[282:48.78]He comes and shoots a fucking arrow at my dead body.
[283:15.60]He's actually angry.
[283:18.90]Not really, I'm just disappointed.
[283:20.88]I don't think anger is correct.
[283:23.30]I think I'm just genuinely, genuinely, genuinely disappointed.
[283:30.78]I'm genuinely...
[283:43.42]He's sad, Maul.
[283:48.15]I really thought I was gonna do it on that last one.
[283:50.39]I'm just so disappointed about it.
[283:53.81]Did somebody think that this game actually isn't even two-player?
[284:04.60]Why did that not kill you?
[284:05.38]The third hit didn't even land.
[284:15.61]I can't even hurt these fucking guys.
[284:31.98]Aim at that guy.
[284:33.14]That's what I wanted you to do.
[284:42.01]Punished for choosing joke character.
[284:43.83]Gimli's not even bad in the game.
[284:45.31]He's just slow.
[284:50.11]Don't even... Give me my 10,000 experience.
[285:12.27]Why does it have to keep hitting me?
[285:13.55]I'm trying to just run around.
[285:14.69]I can't even.
[285:15.23]What am I even going to tell you now?
[285:24.68]Look at that.
[285:25.56]I'm not even hurting him.
[285:28.26]Stream from your bathtub again?
[285:29.28]Yeah.
[285:42.15]Just never-ending stunlock.
[285:46.15]Fuck you, guy.
[285:47.67]Fuck off.
[285:48.97]Get out of here.
[285:54.84]I'm... I... I... I'll see you guys later.
[285:59.86]See you later.
[286:03.49]First tried the final boss of No More Heroes, but can't kill these dudes.
[286:06.83]This game's 20 years old.
[286:09.64]and might not be tuned to the best way that 2020 games could be tuned.
[286:14.27]I'm dead.
[286:55.32]Another child's game Jeremy can't beat.
[286:58.23]You don't understand.
[286:59.79]I know that you're fucking with me and that's fine, but this game is rough.
[287:04.45]This game is... rough.
[287:10.12]I know, I know you're trying to get the guy to be like, fuck you, idiot, fucking stupid, you chat member.
[287:16.21]I don't even like you, you're an asshole.
[287:18.25]No, I know what you're doing, I know.
[287:20.34]This game's rough.
[287:40.26]He used to like Lord of the Rings.
[287:42.50]Lord of the Rings.
[287:43.04]I'm never reading the book.
[287:44.02]I'm never reading the book.
[287:44.76]Yeah, I'm not ever going to read the Lord of the Rings book.
[287:49.75]Not that I planned on it.
[287:54.17]Dude, he... I love you, Jeremy.
[287:59.05]I'm so sorry this had to happen.
[288:00.57]I didn't like...
[288:11.54]I'm gonna be fine I didn't like break my leg Alright, don't blow it here I need these points
[288:32.73]Dude, I'm so sorry that you, like, fell out your window and, like, broke both your legs.
[288:36.07]That's the equivalent of how I feel apparently right now playing Lord of the Rings with two towers.
[288:43.09]Don't.
[288:43.57]Please.
[288:57.18]Drop a health pack.
[288:58.00]Drop a- DON'T!
[289:13.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[289:18.19]Dermot, I'm so sorry.
[289:18.89]Your gamer license has been revoked.
[289:20.29]You can't take that from me.
[289:21.25]You can't take that away from me.
[289:23.05]No, no, you can't take that from me.
[289:24.49]You can't take that from me.
[289:27.11]I'm sorry, Jeremy, but we have to.
[289:29.09]No, you can't take that from me.
[289:30.49]Is it the start of the movie where I become the bad guy or something?
[289:34.68]Where I gotta lose everything?
[289:40.21]Sorry, it's on the list and we have to take it.
[289:42.38]No, no, no, no, you don't need you to understand what I built this up from nothing Okay, don't fuck around cuz I'm gonna die by the magnet enemies Oh
[290:05.43]no health you can't be fucking serious come here come here come here come here come here come here come here come here come here nice dance you waited me oh my fuck I can't lose this if I lose this I have to turn this frame off I have to I have to look at that like this how do you dodge this you just don't you just don't you just don't it's impossible
[290:37.66]You can't block any rams into you!
[290:39.52]I'm gonna start biting the controller.
[290:45.38]I'm gonna bite into the controller.
[290:52.69]Try the wall with the dwarf?
[290:53.71]No, they made him 15% slower to keep the moviegoers happy.
[290:59.09]Instead of having a consistent three character game.
[291:27.32]You should return to this.
[291:29.28]Yeah, we'll return to the king.
[291:32.34]Not to the two towers.
[291:36.01]I would rather... I'd rather go to the barber shop after a long day of customers.
[291:41.41]Make them fear the wolves of Isengard.
[291:43.50]Take a broom and fucking sweep up all the hair on the ground.
[291:47.70]And bake it into a large vanilla cake.
[291:51.47]And eat it.
[291:51.91]Let's see if I can block it.
[292:00.76]You can't block it.
[292:12.59]Prove it.
[292:13.55]Fine, dude.
[292:13.97]I'll prove it.
[292:23.61]That's literally a Filthy Frank video.
[292:26.75]Is it really?
[292:30.16]What?
[292:30.44]Does that actually happen?
[292:36.02]Literally a Filthy... Wait, he goes the... He gets a bunch of hair from the barber?
[292:45.43]Does that actually happen?
[292:47.55]Watch.
[292:56.40]He's running me over.
[292:57.34]Wait, there's no damage.
[292:59.62]I'm gonna fucking start molting.
[293:09.14]Spit's everywhere.
[293:10.10]It's everywhere.
[293:15.60]No, put your fuck off.
[293:35.58]Jeremy, are you winning?
[293:39.36]It depends what you mean by that sentence.
[293:43.01]Literally, no.
[293:45.99]Fundamentally?
[293:46.89]No.
[293:52.13]Theoretically?
[293:52.87]No.
[293:58.01]Metaphysically?
[293:59.31]No.
[294:08.71]Hypothetically?
[294:09.91]Yes.
[294:22.40]Are you winning, son?
[294:30.44]Chemically?
[294:32.26]No drugs.
[294:33.28]Drug free.
[294:34.86]We got a lot of raids today and I want to say thank you everybody.
[294:48.51]You have to attack him.
[294:49.29]You can't attack him.
[294:51.49]Trust me.
[294:52.33]I beat this like four and a half hours ago.
[294:56.38]You can't attack him until his dog goes in the air.
[295:11.82]This game is chilly times.
[295:14.03]This game is like chilly time level of difficult.
[295:16.49]You know, I think I'm holding it together pretty well.
[295:19.75]Considering how hard I think this is.
[295:23.19]I think I'm holding it together pretty well.
[295:26.15]I think I'm doing alright.
[295:27.35]I think... Metaphysically, I could be better.
[295:32.82]Theoretically, I could be doing better.
[295:34.02]But hypothetically, I'm doing just fine.
[295:40.19]I mean, my pants are just wet.
[295:43.41]I must have pissed my pants, like, probably an hour and a half ago.
[295:45.59]I don't know.
[295:46.70]I don't remember doing that.
[295:47.76]I must have.
[295:50.04]I mean, my pants are theoretically wet.
[296:11.13]Hypothetically wet pants.
[296:19.90]Just go in the air so I can get my 10,000 points.
[296:26.95]What do I upgrade though?
[296:27.85]Health?
[296:55.03]Why have none of you dropped health?
[297:04.64]That's what I want to know.
[297:08.42]Upgrade your brain.
[297:13.10]Mod a founder and a subscript of subscriber You're the number one person I can rely on for complete support Really You supposed to help me
[297:45.62]A traitor.
[297:47.08]We got a traitor amongst us.
[297:48.40]So close.
[298:09.75]So close.
[298:13.22]Dermot, are you doing the dodge button?
[298:15.12]Okay, hold on.
[298:18.08]No more looking at chat.
[298:19.81]The people that are not my supporters just want to see me fail.
[298:32.57]I look over here in this chat, and when I look over and I don't see... Go for it.
[298:38.10]You're the man.
[298:39.56]You can do this.
[298:41.46]You're doing so good.
[298:43.34]Oh, this game looks really hard.
[298:46.14]No, you know what I mean?
[298:46.94]No.
[298:48.15]No, no.
[298:48.51]They're traitors.
[298:49.09]All of them.
[298:49.37]Your people were defended.
[298:51.37]But we paid for it with many lives.
[298:55.09]I nearly lost my own.
[299:08.45]Okay, let's get some points here.
[299:09.92]12,000.
[299:10.02]Alright, Aragorn.
[299:13.38]Can we please?
[299:15.00]What just happened?
[299:18.92]Okay. ...
[299:44.85]He hasn't gotten a single perfect all game?
[299:46.41]That's not true.
[299:48.21]How do you get a perfect there?
[299:49.53]You just don't.
[299:50.23]You can't.
[299:50.69]There's no perfect there.
[299:56.14]You gotta stand around in a circle.
[299:58.70]Surrounded by enemies.
[300:00.37]At every front.
[300:01.67]Behind me, in front of me, to the left of me, right of me.
[300:03.95]Enemies everywhere.
[300:14.23]You should read the controls.
[300:18.97]Alright.
[300:21.33]I got the health upgrade.
[300:23.55]There's one more health upgrade.
[300:26.25]I am going to actually do this one.
[300:27.71]I'm gonna try to get some perfects.
[300:28.95]I'm gonna try to really get some quality shit.
[300:33.42]On... What's the one where you have to kill a hundred people?
[300:45.09]Forest?
[300:45.57]No.
[300:47.15]It's this one right here.
[300:48.85]Alright, let's go.
[300:49.65]I can't believe you've been doing this all night.
[300:55.66]You've out-streamed even... you out-streamed me.
[300:59.72]Sometimes you gotta lock in.
[301:02.65]And hate play something.
[301:08.89]It's his favorite PS2 game.
[301:10.85]Well, that comment came at a really bad time.
[301:14.20]This actually is so good for PS2.
[301:17.28]It's just a little on the extreme side.
[301:20.42]Alright, let's go.
[301:26.76]Let me get some good combos.
[301:43.41]What's the new move I have?
[301:45.89]What's the new move?
[301:51.39]You should look at the controls.
[302:01.13]No, I didn't get a new move.
[302:02.05]I didn't get a new move.
[302:03.99]Right, because I did the health.
[302:25.12]Nice perfect You know how you get a perfect?
[302:37.17]By having combos Aragorn doesn't have any combos
[302:42.15]I did the health upgrade first.
[303:31.67]It's so hard you have no idea When you when you parry you don't gain anything from parrying It just stops at one attack and then it says yeah, I'm checking you again I
[303:57.37]It doesn't do anything.
[303:58.33]It doesn't... It's not like a... No, it's just...
[304:27.56]That's my new ringtone.
[304:32.98]I gotta make it to the bridge.
[304:33.76]Let's go.
[304:40.58]Oh, by God, it was the Horn of Gondor!
[304:42.98]Was it?
[305:00.01]You know when you go to the arcade and you feel like the games there are tuned to a way to take all the fucking quarters out of your pocket?
[305:09.04]I feel like this game wants me to put like $200 in quarters into it.
[305:15.91]Was this in the arcades first?
[305:38.94]I walked in the... Hold on, let me reach into my pocket and grab my tokens.
[305:47.11]Continue!
[305:52.37]Come on, fart!
[306:16.03]I told her Jerma's gonna give up an hour ago we must defend well it's too late now it's too late now to give up you know what I'm saying I'm turning into dust waiting for him
[306:59.39]I'm gonna wake up tomorrow with an email from fucking, like, Warner Brothers.
[307:15.30]We regret to inform you that we have DMCA'd your Twitch stream.
[307:27.14]Please deposit sixteen hundred dollars and quarters into the machine.
[307:33.53]At once.
[308:12.28]Just cheat?
[308:15.47]Why would I cheat at this point?
[308:27.39]There are no cheats.
[308:28.87]What do you mean just cheat?
[308:49.29]Yeah, you know what?
[308:50.99]This is bullshit.
[308:52.57]Because the three other slots of the arcade game with three other players are supposed to be are empty.
[308:58.09]And I decided to do it alone.
[309:00.73]I'm playing the X-Men game with an empty booth.
[309:12.90]You all know how that goes.
[309:22.31]There's no co-op in this one.
[309:24.33]Don't say that.
[309:28.21]Don't steal my thunder.
[309:29.39]Don't steal my thunder.
[309:32.12]Come on.
[309:52.45]How many times do I have to shoot you with an arrow?
[310:09.34]Name it.
[310:09.66]I got a great video name for this video.
[310:11.66]Nightmare on Helm's Deep.
[310:16.12]What would be Nightmare on Helm's Deep Street?
[310:18.37]Because I did make that reference.
[310:27.80]I did make that reference about it being... Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
[310:33.74]You know what else would be a pretty good one?
[310:35.49]If I could beat this fucking goddamn game.
[311:36.04]I need that experience given me Frodo's almost dead I have to run over there We have to go now to the bridge Lego Lord of the Rings
[312:08.93]I'm never gonna kill all these guys over here.
[313:07.89]Let this motherfucker die anyways.
[313:10.61]Why do I even have to save this guy?
[313:12.08]He already dies.
[313:12.82]We could have just watched two Lord of the Rings movies by now.
[313:30.13]You're gonna play this longer than the actual Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.
[313:38.41]Don't say that.
[313:39.79]What is the actual Lord of the Rings trilogy?
[313:42.15]What's the full length?
[313:46.38]10 and a half hours?
[313:54.94]12 hours?
[313:55.98]10 and a half hours?
[313:57.92]Don't say that.
[313:58.42]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[314:01.30]Here's the CCTV footage again.
[314:22.37]Okay, I seriously... He's pushing me around the screen so fast, I fucking can't see anything.
[314:30.12]I need help.
[314:32.10]This feels rotten.
[314:34.46]This feels rotten, I'll tell you.
[314:36.07]I need help.
[315:05.01]He's so fast!
[315:08.75]Oh my god, what a sloppy mess.
[315:12.77]I feel like I'm watching two bugs fight.
[315:16.47]This is what it looks like when two beetles attack each other.
[315:18.60]I'm like National Geographic.
[315:36.70]Don't hit me!
[315:37.94]Don't fucking hit me!
[315:38.98]Don't hit me!
[315:55.90]Having a cranky wanky!
[315:58.40]Oh, fuck!
[316:02.00]I said I wasn't gonna do that ever again.
[316:07.32]He's having a little cranky wanky right now.
[316:18.91]Get over here.
[316:42.75]Every time they have a little baby
[317:13.14]Remember this part in Lord of the Rings?
[317:14.38]When they sped the movie up by 300%?
[317:20.32]I loved that part.
[317:38.69]I'm gonna run on the sticks!
[317:39.71]I'm gonna run on the stones!
[317:40.56]I'm gonna run on the stones!
[317:49.96]Is there any more stones?
[317:54.71]What happens when you don't have any more stones?
[318:30.09]Dude, combos, they don't hurt him.
[318:32.96]He takes damage and then is invincible for like a full second.
[318:38.37]That's a fact.
[319:20.19]You want let's get another guy over here I just want another guy that makes sense.
[319:26.99]Yeah Why I don't know just because I don't know Why not?
[319:41.90]Hey boss, does that ever happen again?
[319:43.09]No
[320:12.85]This game's actually making me not care about this scene.
[320:16.83]This is like a really bad, sad scene.
[320:19.81]I don't give a shit anymore.
[320:21.35]Be at peace.
[320:24.99]I've seen it like five times.
[320:26.37]Son of Gondor.
[320:37.58]Okay, here we go.
[320:39.84]It's time.
[320:43.07]Nice perfect, by the way.
[320:44.25]I know, I know that that person, I was like, hey, shut up, dude.
[320:48.67]Perfect, whatever, it's hard.
[320:50.33]That person waited until I didn't get a perfect on a regular level to write, you know, like, fucking nice perfect.
[320:57.27]And it was a good one.
[320:58.91]It was actually, it was really good.
[321:02.41]It was a fucking gotcha.
[321:03.63]It really was.
[321:07.86]But I hope that person is banned from the channel.
[321:12.31]How dare you.
[321:15.13]Okay.
[321:18.63]What is the play here?
[321:22.07]I need a combo.
[321:23.05]I need a single goddamn combo.
[321:31.27]Press and hold triangle... Swift terror.
[321:35.35]I need a combo.
[321:38.09]And then I think I might wait till... I need level 4.
[321:47.45]I don't use this shit.
[321:50.85]Powerful enemies.
[321:53.48]Will this work on shielded people?
[321:58.30]Rising attack?
[321:58.82]I feel like I don't want rising attack.
[322:00.02]I feel like I actually use it.
[322:04.00]You missed that one.
[322:04.62]Try another ladder.
[322:13.42]You're seriously just leveling up Aragorn to kick ladders.
[322:15.52]You really don't need combos.
[322:18.64]That's a really good point.
[322:21.12]That's flawless.
[322:22.16]That's true.
[322:22.68]That's absolutely... What a statement.
[322:25.58]Yeah, I don't... I just level enough to run around and kick stuff.
[322:32.60]You're right. ...
[322:48.39]I'm gonna save it.
[323:02.44]Oh, you missed that one.
[323:04.52]Oh, you missed that one.
[323:05.96]Try a ladder.
[323:07.64]Oh, you missed that one.
[323:08.86]Try a ladder.
[323:11.18]Oh, you missed that one.
[323:12.50]Try a ladder.
[323:23.44]One more level with Aragorn and that should be it.
[323:30.44]Take a crack at the ladder?
[323:31.24]No, I need the second health upgrade.
[323:40.79]Not- I'm not doing the burning building one again.
[323:46.31]Which one should I do?
[323:47.87]The dog.
[323:49.15]Again?
[323:49.53]No.
[323:54.08]What's an easy... I'll just do this easy-ass mission.
[323:56.34]This'll be it.
[324:02.00]Just cheat, don't grind.
[324:03.58]I have to do it legit at this point.
[324:05.04]It's been almost nine hours, guys.
[324:06.54]I can't... I can't not do this.
[324:11.54]It was here that we would find far more than the two...
[324:17.66]Imagine playing this game for nine hours and like pissing your pants and shitting your pants on stream and then you cheat.
[324:25.85]No, that's not how it works.
[324:28.53]This is so loud.
[324:33.72]I don't know why that is.
[324:40.50]Here's how you get perfects.
[324:47.72]If I can land it.
[324:48.36]This is Batman.
[324:57.95]Give me a break.
[325:02.02]If there's one guy with a shield and a group of enemies, he fucks the whole thing up.
[325:05.84]Because you just bounce off of it randomly.
[325:18.02]Let's go.
[325:22.88]Hey, bro, did you get it perfect yet?
[325:28.92]I'm going!
[325:58.31]Hey, bro!
[326:00.45]Hey, yo, bro, did you get a perfect?
[326:34.68]Alright, don't lose.
[326:35.79]Fuck the perfects.
[326:37.17]Just stay alive.
[326:40.31]I had no health drops this whole time?
[326:41.90]I'll take him!
[327:07.30]Okay, let's do it.
[327:07.90]Pick up this fucking frog.
[327:15.23]Don't fuck this up.
[327:23.73]Jesus.
[327:24.37]God damn it, man.
[327:25.65]He blended him with the whole background.
[327:34.81]Did he just say, I'm not even kidding?
[327:40.39]Easy.
[327:51.76]Honest to fucking God, man.
[327:54.12]Do you really have to fucking fly in here like a hero?
[328:04.01]Two.
[328:04.63]And then hide?
[328:13.25]Hide.
[328:13.89]Here comes another fucking hero.
[328:14.88]Come on!
[328:42.30]I'm running out of fucking things to hide behind here.
[328:55.11]Oh my fucking god, no.
[329:14.86]What happens if you run out of arrows?
[329:17.08]Oh god, I have 30.
[329:17.50]Alright, give me the fucking perfects.
[329:33.33]I had like 50 perfects this round.
[329:34.84]Come on.
[329:35.90]That's like three upgrades.
[329:36.90]Let's go.
[329:55.27]25,000 points, come on.
[330:08.00]Level 4.
[330:11.58]Increases your health permanently.
[330:14.44]Done.
[330:15.85]Fired like a dundane bow, the barbed arrows do serious damage.
[330:31.63]So this is level 6.
[330:32.57]Increases the damage of your speed attack, increases more devastating attack.
[330:46.46]Orcbane is OP.
[330:52.13]Now I'm at level 6.
[330:52.91]Maybe I should do the bow.
[331:01.82]Alright.
[331:05.36]Okay.
[331:06.46]I think it's time to attempt.
[331:35.44]What do you say?
[331:37.88]Ready to knock this out of the fucking park?
[331:41.90]Let's go.
[331:54.19]I got two.
[331:56.21]They're enough for us both, Gimli.
[331:59.53]Take down that ladder before we're overrun!
[332:23.63]Pull the bow.
[332:32.99]You fucking idiots.
[332:49.33]Put the ladder back in the holster.
[332:57.72]Already getting overrun.
[333:01.08]Speaking of being overrun.
[333:07.96]Nice shot, guys.
[333:08.68]We could use some of the ten of you that are over there.
[333:13.15]Over on the right side.
[333:14.77]You know, not all of you.
[333:15.55]Just stuff in the same one pixel.
[333:18.43]Can three of you go to the other side?
[333:45.97]I'm going... No, I'm going right in the middle.
[333:48.19]Left and right side, middle.
[333:48.93]Gonna spawn right now.
[333:50.25]Check it.
[333:52.32]Oh, my brain is just so big.
[333:54.40]It's so huge.
[333:55.42]It's... Like, it hurts.
[333:57.50]I feel it pulsating, and it, like... It hurts.
[334:07.43]I mean, it's full of baked beans, but it's big.
[334:43.54]We're at zero.
[334:44.60]Come on, keep it up.
[334:46.44]Keep it up.
[334:46.74]I don't want to do this shit no more.
[335:01.72]Left and right side.
[335:03.64]Check it.
[335:05.28]Check it.
[335:05.60]Here it comes.
[335:23.71]Right side.
[335:24.09]1, 2, 3.
[335:26.85]That was a hang-up.
[335:27.53]I don't know.
[335:42.18]1, 2, 3.
[335:54.04]Get this guy with me!
[335:54.62]Get this guy with me!
[335:55.26]Behind me!
[336:19.94]One, two, three!
[336:27.50]Good blocks!
[336:28.00]Good blocks!
[336:30.76]Now I'll get out of my way before I kill you.
[336:42.73]How can they be naked?
[336:43.47]Nobody left!
[336:52.12]Legolas.
[336:53.96]There's a body in the way.
[337:03.27]You can't be fucking serious, you cheap motherfucker.
[337:16.13]Darn opportunity, I had to take it.
[337:30.87]There's like a pixel here that you get stuck on.
[337:32.85]It's such dog shit.
[337:35.23]There's one little pixel that you can get stuck on.
[337:38.05]God, smooth it out with the fucking paint tool.
[337:40.49]God damn it, man.
[337:42.25]Oh, come on.
[337:42.95]I have to do this.
[337:45.56]I have to change the route.
[338:13.63]What is with this magnet jump?
[338:15.35]Like, fuck.
[338:19.27]I need help.
[338:19.63]Is there help in that?
[338:20.43]Oh, fuck.
[338:20.85]Here we go.
[338:21.21]Here we go!
[338:21.47]Alright, I have to be careful.
[338:23.54]Don't get hit by a fucking magnum.
[338:25.42]Where's the... Is there help in the box?
[338:26.40]I got the help already, didn't I?
[338:30.90]Didn't I get it?
[338:37.90]It's up there.
[338:38.30]Help.
[338:41.25]Let's go.
[338:41.63]Start it from one.
[339:10.37]But this guy's glued to me like a fucking glue!
[339:13.61]He's glued to me like... Watch out!
[339:24.58]Don't get hit by that!
[339:28.02]Gandalf, save me!
[339:28.70]Gandalf, come on, Gandalf, get in here!
[339:30.90]Gandalf, Gandalf, Gandalf, Gandalf, Gandalf, show yourself!
[339:34.60]Gandalf!
[339:36.08]Gandalf, do something!
[339:38.56]Gandalf, please do something, Gandalf!
[339:42.86]They have fallen back.
[340:03.63]It is over for now.
[340:06.31]I got mine too.
[340:08.49]Then we are level.
[340:10.41]You'll see about that.
[340:16.01]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[340:18.11]That was terrible.
[340:19.55]That was horrible.
[340:20.43]I wanted... I wanted to fucking... I wanted... Gimli, you didn't do shit.
[340:28.86]Legolas, you didn't do shit.
[340:29.82]I did that on my own.
[340:31.18]I did that by myself.
[340:32.32]I just beat all of the... The Knights... The Knights of the Republic, whatever.
[340:40.01]I don't know.
[340:40.33]Knights of Ren.
[340:40.79]I don't know what they... What are they called?
[340:42.71]The... The Mischiefs of Gondor?
[340:47.52]The Orcs of Saur... What is it called?
[340:50.08]What are they actually called?
[340:52.82]The Uruk-hai.
[340:53.26]But what are they... What's the army called?
[341:03.47]The bad guys.
[341:04.15]Who cares?
[341:04.93]Alright, I think I'm going to save my points.
[341:22.39]Oh, by the way, that's also not the hardest mission in the game, apparently.
[341:25.91]The next one is.
[341:26.41]Good luck.
[341:52.38]Joel, if you're watching right now, we're going to have to reschedule.
[341:54.34]Because I'm taking a break tomorrow.
[341:57.53]I'll be back in a couple days after this one.
[342:04.30]We have two levels left.
[342:05.32]Breached wall.
[342:22.58]Anybody have one of those Poland Springs things in their house?
[342:24.66]Do you love them?
[342:27.18]Or is it a pain in the ass?
[342:43.64]Jerma lied about playing with Joel.
[342:45.16]No, I didn't.
[342:45.92]I lied about playing with Joel this weekend.
[342:49.50]But next weekend?
[342:50.80]No, but we know what to do.
[342:51.60]But next weekend?
[342:52.20]What are you up to?
[342:53.10]Hold on.
[343:00.62]Hey, me and Joel weren't in any communication about this.
[343:04.56]We were like, yeah, maybe we'll do it next weekend.
[343:06.28]And then we didn't talk to each other.
[343:08.54]I didn't reach out to him.
[343:09.59]He didn't reach out to me.
[343:10.87]He reached out in the middle of the stream.
[343:13.33]We were like, alright.
[343:14.55]He's like, we'll do it another time.
[343:15.61]Whatever.
[343:18.41]Alright, where do I go?
[343:19.77]Just defend?
[343:20.29]I think I just defend.
[343:34.88]Oh, no arrows left.
[343:35.68]Uh-oh.
[343:38.34]Uh-oh!
[343:42.06]Where are the arrows?
[343:44.73]Uh-oh.
[343:46.55]Uh-oh.
[343:49.07]Oh, it's gonna be toasty in here in a few minutes.
[343:56.62]Are they... You have arrows.
[344:00.20]Give them to me.
[344:01.44]Why are they walking past me?
[344:21.08]Okay, what's next?
[344:27.95]Walk out?
[344:31.93]I see health over there.
[344:33.91]What's the health for?
[344:37.23]Is there another spot I need to go to?
[344:40.85]That's the door.
[344:53.87]I got a perfect coming up.
[344:54.99]Perfect coming up.
[344:56.65]Two perfects.
[344:57.31]Nice.
[344:57.53]I'm just standing right here.
[345:08.40]This is just defend the... Jerm, are you idiot?
[345:11.58]They got into the gate.
[345:12.78]Don't call me an idiot.
[345:18.68]Hey, go... Was it... Go... You're gonna wash your mouth out with soap.
[345:26.17]That's really fucked up, by the way.
[345:27.39]That's, like, dangerous and shit.
[345:29.27]Do people do that?
[345:29.85]Oh, this is where we get overwhelmed.
[345:36.56]Explode.
[345:40.20]Does that affect the gate?
[345:45.57]It does.
[345:45.87]Alright, get up there.
[346:02.37]Get away from the fucking door.

[346:59.24]Jesus, man.
[347:20.29]Jesus!
[347:22.11]I might as well just let him blow up next to the door.
[347:23.99]It's gonna be less damage probably than if they... You know what I'm saying?
[347:28.83]It's probably less damage.
[347:31.19]Just blow him up at the door.
[347:33.54]That's probably the strat.
[347:51.55]Oh, fuck.
[347:52.93]Just blow up, blow up, bro.

[366:03.96]Gimli didn't even hit him once.

[366:12.04]Oh wait, I'm sorry, is that Gimli behind me?
[366:26.79]I'm trying to just queue up a big move here.
[366:29.83]There it is.
[366:32.96]That's it.
[366:40.35]I don't even know what's going on.
[366:41.40]Okay.

[366:47.54]Great.
[366:52.32]Alright, fucking tone down the sass here, Jeremy.
[366:55.32]Let's relax.
[367:02.89]Tone down the... Everything that happens is not my fault.
[367:07.15]I don't make any mistakes.
[367:08.25]Nothing is my fault.
[367:09.01]It's the game's fault.
[367:09.66]Everything.
[367:11.68]Can we tone that down?
[367:12.96]I'm crossing that path.
[367:19.68]I just crossed it.
[367:27.33]Really, though?
[367:27.97]This is not my fault.
[367:29.19]What you just saw right there had nothing to do with me.
[367:41.33]Everyone does that.
[367:42.30]I know everybody does.
[367:43.36]It's like such a bad trait of gamers.
[367:46.46]We all do it.
[367:47.78]Everybody does.
[367:49.46]Doesn't matter who you are.
[367:50.58]Oh, no, that's like fucking stupid.
[367:54.17]That's stupid what just happened.
[367:55.11]No, that like, what?
[367:56.19]What?
[367:56.87]What?
[367:57.13]Okay, sure.
[367:59.13]What?
[368:00.55]That wouldn't happen to me.
[368:01.79]That doesn't happen to me.
[368:02.97]Okay, sure.
[368:12.06]I mean, I pressed X and it didn't do anything?
[368:13.84]Like, that's not me.
[368:16.24]Something's wrong with the game.
[368:19.07]I have a bootleg copy of the broken game.
[368:24.97]My game copy must be bootlegged.
[368:31.95]Why the fuck would they put it in here like this?
[368:35.56]Right?
[368:39.20]Speaking, friend.
[368:46.87]Level 6.
[368:52.21]Somebody recharged me.
[368:53.19]I just drank two full cups of water.
[368:57.68]Alright, I got 34,000 points.
[368:58.70]Level 6.
[368:59.14]Let's get those upgrades.
[369:02.44]You did that 15 minutes ago.
[369:06.60]Yeah, that's what I was going for.
[369:10.11]Alright.
[369:10.55]Increases the damage of my speed attack.
[369:12.87]Yes.
[369:14.07]And increases your health permanently.
[369:16.44]Yes.
[369:20.04]Instantly kill an attacking orc.
[369:21.80]That sounds pretty good, actually.
[369:23.08]But what about... I'm level 7.
[369:26.02]Level 8.
[369:27.04]I need 10,000 for the health.
[369:29.95]And then 6,000 for the bow.
[369:31.49]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[369:38.69]I mean, that's pretty good.
[369:41.35]There's only one more level I can even do.
[369:44.17]Right?
[369:45.13]How close am I to level 8?
[369:51.41]Hold on, let me save this here.
[369:52.41]Because I need to get to level 8 with Aragorn.
[370:00.38]Before we do the final impossible level.
[370:08.72]Do you eye-dose?
[370:10.10]I don't know.
[370:25.63]What is this?
[370:27.31]I mean, no.
[370:29.11]Eye-dose?
[370:29.69]Like, dose?
[370:39.42]iDoser is an application for the playback of proprietary audio content.
[370:46.60]Did you just make this word up?
[370:47.60]Uh, I'll do... I'll do the forest.
[371:07.45]We support you even if you iDose.
[371:10.80]You guys are up late.
[371:11.62]11.30.
[371:11.64]2.30 AM Eastern.
[371:15.82]There's still a lot of people here.
[371:19.92]There are a shitload of people still here.
[371:21.24]Thanks for staying up, guys.
[371:24.60]We should be done shortly.
[371:27.48]Look here, you little shit.
[371:28.48]I've been supporting you this whole time.
[371:29.72]Alright.
[371:48.29]Where am I?
[371:49.29]Come on!
[372:00.53]I had it.
[372:04.05]It's always an asshole with a shield that fucks the whole thing up.
[372:09.55]And now I got perfect.
[372:11.11]I'm sad.
[372:12.73]I'm not even mad, I'm just disappointed.
[372:14.27]Alright.
[372:20.04]Okay.
[372:20.52]Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[372:24.10]Like, are you the only enemy in the game that I can't hit with a... What in the name of fucking god is going on right now?
[372:37.46]That guy's bodying me.
[372:41.78]Yes, he is.
[372:42.22]And it's embarrassing.
[372:52.20]You got the late-night debuff?
[372:54.54]No, you know... What really does happen to me is I don't get the late-night debuff.
[372:58.66]I get... I get the late-night power.
[373:02.62]I increase in power the more I go off the handle.
[373:28.55]He's a vampire?
[373:32.57]What's the Pokémon that, like, when he rages, he gets more powerful?
[373:37.43]Like, the more upset this Pokémon gets, the better he is, and the more you want to put him in your party.
[373:47.28]Is there, like, a superhero that does that?
[373:49.82]Is there, like, a character superhero Pokémon that, when he gets upset and over the edge, that's when he actually is worth using?
[374:06.30]The Hulk!
[374:07.96]Yeah, the Hulk.
[374:09.98]That's what I'm thinking of.
[374:14.11]That's like actually who I'm saying is, I'm actually thinking of the Hulk.
[374:18.23]That's so stupid.
[374:23.09]Who's that guy that when he gets really mad, he does, he gets like stronger?
[374:28.72]He's big and he's green.
[374:30.84]You guys know who I'm talking about?
[374:35.95]perfect time Oscar the grouch shaggy shaggy doesn't get angry
[375:04.92]When was the last time you saw Shaggy and Scooby-Doo get mad?
[375:07.90]Like it was really out of character for him.
[375:16.59]Shaggy definitely beat... Level 8.
[375:38.82]Excellent.
[375:46.14]Excellent.
[375:48.18]Excellent.
[375:49.60]You don't remember that one scene where Shaggy snapped and screamed at somebody?
[375:56.05]Troll.
[375:56.67]This is the double troll level, isn't it?
[375:59.07]Remember how mad I got at this?
[376:01.45]Remember I was sitting here going, dude, how are you supposed to beat this?
[376:06.58]How is this even possible, man?
[376:08.63]You do it with the ever-growing technique.
[376:16.79]Wait.
[376:17.17]There's a chest in here.
[376:30.70]Ooh, it's experience.
[376:35.60]Friendship.
[376:36.46]Friendship.
[376:37.62]Again?
[376:38.02]Nice jump scare.
[376:43.44]Too bad you do dumb to pull it off.
[376:47.58]Double KO.
[376:48.40]Mortal Kombat style.
[376:54.88]This game is hard.
[377:00.67]You're doing good.
[377:04.62]It is pretty hard.
[377:05.30]The game is pretty hard.
[377:09.28]Everyone told me that it's not that hard.
[377:11.36]You're playing a game that I beat when I was eight.
[377:16.62]But they're misremembering.
[377:18.76]They played it on easy.
[377:21.94]And not today, not tomorrow, not next week, not even probably next year.
[377:27.84]But eventually they're going to open up their PlayStation 2 and they're going to go to their old memory card.
[377:32.30]And they're going to see their save file for Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.
[377:37.12]And they're going to go, oh right, here it is.
[377:38.82]Remember this old fucking dopey game?
[377:41.03]And they're going to open it.
[377:43.27]And it's going to be a completed game with a continue on easy.
[377:49.41]And I'm gonna get like 600 letters in the mail apologizing to me.
[377:55.17]I'm mailing it to him right now!
[378:25.41]Here we go.
[378:28.03]Make it look easy.
[378:28.68]Come on, Jeremy.
[378:29.26]Make it look easy.
[378:30.46]Make it look easy, Jeremy.
[378:58.46]Let's go.
[379:09.40]Aragorn, son of Aragorn.
[379:14.35]Aragorn, son of Aragorn.
[379:18.99]In that great forest, many paths converge.
[379:25.73]Somebody just says, true.
[379:26.89]You know what I'm doing.
[379:27.85]You know what it sounds like.
[379:37.05]Can I get to level 9?
[379:50.80]Cad, why are you astroturfing the stream right now?
[380:00.65]This is real.
[380:01.27]Hey, man, I'm being supportive.
[380:06.23]Yeah, but you, uh, I looked over, you said, like, some nice things, and you told me to just fuck off or something.
[380:11.52]Alright, let's get increased permanent health.
[380:15.98]Level 8.
[380:20.08]Super bow.
[380:21.95]Or should I do the instantly kill an attacking Uruk-hai?
[380:24.75]Square X?
[380:26.35]Square X, R2, Square X. I can instantly kill any Uruk-hai, instantly kill any orc.
[380:30.83]That's definitely what I should do.
[380:36.51]I can instantly kill any enemy in the game.
[380:54.82]They can do it to orcs.
[380:56.11]What does linked move mean?
[380:58.29]I have to block.
[380:59.01]So it's block XR2.
[381:00.51]I have to chest that out.
[381:01.33]I need 40 goddamn points.
[381:08.20]So it's a counter.
[381:11.37]We don't even need it.
[381:13.45]Let's go.
[381:35.83]What is the combined length of all the Lord of the Rings?
[381:41.41]The three films in total are 11 hours and 23 minutes.
[381:53.34]The stream is about 10 hours long.
[381:58.74]Let's try it.
[381:59.74]This is Hornburg Courtyard.
[382:04.73]This is the one.
[382:11.71]That's a lot of boring shit.
[382:16.15]Oh, those movies though.
[382:18.43]Those movies are legendary.
[382:20.29]I don't agree with you.
[382:21.74]I don't agree with you.
[382:22.38]Alright, here we go.
[382:41.43]What is with this camera?
[382:46.41]Another CCTV.
[382:49.59]Oh, wait.
[382:50.34]Holy shit, Jerry.
[382:54.46]And what started as a small confrontation has turned into an absolute bloodbath brawl outside of the 7-Eleven.
[383:03.08]We have no idea what may have started it.
[383:04.60]I think somebody called the small one there short.
[383:08.76]And spit in his face.
[383:12.14]looks like they're upset that McDonald's they're upset we're not even Roger I'm not even entirely sure where they got these weapons
[383:39.40]That's not the McDonald's.
[383:41.55]That's not the McDonald's.
[383:44.43]Why do they need a McDonald's?
[383:49.59]Ow, my left arm hurts.
[383:51.51]Okay, we're good.
[383:56.56]Look at these perfects I'm gonna get.
[383:57.72]Where am I?
[384:10.56]Roger, what started it was a simple altercation.
[384:16.72]People have started to actually pick sides in this fight.
[384:23.19]The battle for Home Depot.
[384:29.01]Roger, people on social media are calling this the Battle of Home Depot.
[384:37.06]This reporter cannot understand just how ridiculous this is, seeing this from above above.
[384:43.23]You don't see the other 300 people that are back behind the doors.
[384:46.05]Holy shit, Legolas is dead.
[385:04.14]This is a mess.
[385:06.34]This is a fucking mess.
[385:09.60]This is just seriously... I don't even... Where even is Legolas?
[385:23.77]Where is he?
[385:26.63]Where is Legolas?
[385:28.18]Where is Legolas?
[385:29.66]Where is Legolas?
[385:32.04]Is he up top?
[385:32.64]What do you mean the stairs?
[385:38.01]Guys, I don't got the best angle right now.
[385:40.89]Up the stairs?
[385:47.45]He's fucking dead!
[385:48.41]Can we fly a little bit closer, Tom?
[386:03.43]Helicopter sound effects.
[386:07.86]No, somebody will put it on.
[386:09.10]Somebody will do it.
[386:09.88]Somebody will edit it together.
[386:11.46]Somebody will do it.
[386:17.40]Somebody.
[386:18.92]I can't pump it through.
[386:19.84]No, you do the joke, lazy.
[386:24.54]No, I'm saying I can't pump it through this because I'm going through my XLR thing.
[386:31.65]Hold on.
[386:34.50]I'll take care of this
[387:23.55]Okay.
[387:25.64]I'll even help you out here.
[387:26.40]Okay.
[387:27.54]So... Alright, so...
[388:03.07]Roger I'm up here in the channel 5 news chapter and we're getting word that there seems to be some type of altercation going on outside of the McDonald's Not entirely sure exactly why this is starting But I'm getting sources in my ear right now that apparently somebody threw a McChicken out the window And hit some lady in the face
[388:30.62]And apparently started this massive altercation out here.
[388:34.60]They've started picking sides.
[388:40.28]And actually, if you can see, there's two people down there who have swords.
[388:46.94]And I don't know where they got these swords.
[388:53.56]In fact, I'm not entirely sure where all these green men came from.
[389:01.70]This might be the strangest thing I've ever seen in my damn life, Roger.
[389:19.69]Roger, I don't even know... Apparently, there appears to be orcs down here.
[389:29.37]Where's the music coming from?
[389:41.09]Roger Roger Roger, I'm sorry about what just happened there I thought it might be a little comical to play some old old helm steep music from Lord of the Rings I Mean this is not comical at all.
[389:56.96]This is people fighting and killing each other around here But again apparently the chicken out the window I
[390:07.68]I believe it may have hit the man in the center of your screen there.
[390:11.50]It may have hit his girlfriend in the face.
[390:14.22]We're getting a new feed here now.
[390:17.41]Oh, he's good.
[390:19.03]This is... Oh, right into the camera.
[390:24.17]Did you get that, Larry?
[390:24.93]Did you get a close-up of that?
[390:29.13]I'm just unbelievable.
[390:36.84]Roger, I know there's a scheduled... I know you want to see.
[390:41.63]Yes.
[390:43.03]We will return to Shut Up and Dance.
[390:48.49]Just after this, but this is... This is breaking news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[391:04.49]Put live in the corner.
[391:09.31]I have to beat this fucking game.
[391:16.35]Save Legolas.
[391:17.09]Hold on, I have to reconnect all this.
[391:19.95]Put on scrolling text?
[391:22.99]No, I... Before my gamer liquid is gone.
[391:26.03]They call it the Battle of Home Depot.
[391:32.69]They all seem to have weapons.
[391:35.99]A brawl has started out here.
[391:44.90]black and white.
[391:48.46]By the way, this helicopter is really fucking low.
[391:54.59]Where did they even get the costumes?
[391:56.57]Why would you be in a costume?
[392:02.74]Why would you be in a fucking costume?
[392:06.94]well you see the opportunity to larp oh this is my chance there's a huge fight going on outside the McDonald's this is my opportunity I've been saving this for so long where's legolas
[392:37.38]Oh, come on!
[392:38.06]I saved him!
[392:49.29]The Mick war.
[392:59.65]I have to turn this back to normal.
[393:02.23]I have to turn this back to normal.
[393:04.37]This is abnormal.
[393:05.79]I need to be back to normal.
[393:08.88]I can't even- I gotta take the filter off.
[393:24.56]You have shields.
[393:28.42]Put it back on.
[393:29.54]Put it back on.
[393:30.18]Put it back on.
[393:31.64]Put it back on.
[393:32.32]Put it back on.
[393:36.67]Put it back on for a sec.
[393:37.55]Put it back on for a sec.
[394:46.17]Turning back in here, Roger, it appears that some of these patrons have taken the car doors off of their cars.
[394:53.65]And I guess they're using them as shields.
[394:57.88]I can't get a closer look here.
[394:59.06]I mean, there are 13, there are 14, no, 15 cars over here.
[395:04.43]that are missing doors.
[395:16.95]I hate to, I really hate to interrupt again.
[395:24.32]It looks like he may have coded his weapon in something.
[395:31.30]He's coded his weapon in something.
[395:34.08]It looks magical.
[395:37.74]Roger, this is fucked up.
[395:47.01]Roger, this is the most fucked up thing I've ever seen.
[395:53.89]People are dressing up.
[395:55.43]They're coming down here in all kinds of clothes.
[395:57.41]I have no f***ing idea.
[396:01.89]I excuse my language.
[396:15.53]Get this off before I lose my mind.
[396:20.01]Live beeping.
[396:30.67]I can't.
[396:31.59]I need to win.
[396:32.49]Breaking news.

[397:23.00]By the way, Roger, why is it 2020 and we still use black and white cameras?
[397:28.75]He's dead.
[397:39.15]I'm winning.
[397:39.63]I'm winning.
[397:40.13]We crossed 10 hours.
[397:41.55]It's time to go.
[397:42.56]I'm done.
[397:43.00]I'm done.
[397:43.26]Let's go.
[397:43.56]Let's go.
[397:43.82]I gotta beat it right now.
[397:49.65]Move.
[397:49.93]Move.
[397:50.15]Move.
[397:50.29]Let's go.
[397:50.56]Let's go.
[397:50.92]Win.
[397:51.26]Win.
[397:51.62]Win.
[397:52.22]Win.
[397:52.52]The battle for all of Middle Earth right now.
[398:17.77]Come on, I got perfects right here.
[398:19.18]Give me a break.
[398:45.85]Somebody said, I feel like I'm watching a GIF.
[398:49.29]I feel like I'm watching a GIF.
[398:55.02]Oh, it's muted.
[398:57.91]Oh, God.
[399:11.74]Roger, this seems to be an aggressive clicking noise coming from this new, this streamer's new dogshit mic setup.
[399:19.78]Yeah, this just in.
[399:21.23]Hold on, just getting word here, Roger.
[399:22.83]It seems that streamer has been streaming and making videos for almost 10 years and still can't figure out how to set up a fucking proper compressor on his microphone.
[399:33.41]So every half second you hear... Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.
[399:40.29]Wow, it's surprising, Roger.
[399:42.60]You'd think that somebody that went to literal film school and has almost 10 years of experience wouldn't get so upset about somebody throwing a McChicken at him out a window.
[399:59.33]Legolas.
[400:18.80]Come on, fight through.
[400:23.70]I hate this fucking 2D, 3D.
[400:25.34]I hate this 2, 3D, 3D, 2D, 3D.
[400:28.56]Get out of my way.
[400:31.94]That guy dropped instantly.
[400:44.53]Alright, perfect.
[400:44.99]Here we go.
[400:46.09]Legolas is going to be saved now.
[400:51.96]Roger, it looks like he's dealing with a potential 2D, 3D problem.
[401:06.34]Who's in trouble?
[401:06.86]Gimli?
[401:14.57]Dermot, are you drunk?
[401:18.50]Not at all.
[401:19.44]Not even slightly.
[401:21.10]Not even close.
[401:21.72]Can't get through!
[402:00.75]I need those Perfects!
[402:01.41]I need those Perfects!
[402:01.99]I need those Perfects!
[402:02.65]Perfects!
[402:02.95]Perfects!
[402:03.27]Perfects!
[402:03.67]I need those Perfects!
[402:04.17]I need those Perfects!
[402:16.14]If you're not drunk, then turn the webcam on and let's see what you have in front of you for a drink.
[402:18.92]Nah, I don't have to do that!
[402:19.70]Um...
[402:27.54]Why did I go right in the middle of the mosh pit?
[402:29.54]Don't ever do that.
[402:30.21]I'm gonna die.
[402:40.37]Where?
[402:49.70]What the fuck is going on?
[403:00.36]I can't even swing!
[403:01.90]They all have a shield!
[403:04.07]You can't even swing a normal swing!
[403:06.13]This seriously is fucking crazy.
[403:51.02]There's nothing to even look at.
[404:00.17]Uh, what is going- archers on the wall?
[404:03.57]But what about the fucking hundred people that are smashing into the wall?
[404:19.54]Legolas, do anything.
[404:23.30]Do anything.
[404:26.18]Do anything.
[404:29.25]Anything.
[404:30.63]Anything.
[404:31.95]Anything.
[404:33.39]Do anything.
[404:45.62]Do anything.
[404:56.38]That's Hearthstone.
[405:03.21]What am I doing?
[405:10.62]Is that it?
[405:12.88]I'm stuck.
[405:21.46]Boop boop boop boop boop boop... Uh huhuhuhuh huh uhuh... Get. Move move move move.... Perfect, it's perfect, it's perfect, perfect...
[405:30.00]Move.
[405:31.00]Nice, good job. You blocked- good.
[405:33.00]Great artificial intelligence, I'm glad we've come to fucking quantum computing.
[406:14.37]This mission reminds me of when you go into Gary's mod, and you just spawn like 20 scientists versus like 40 fucking antlions, and you just look and just watch from 100 feet above.
[406:41.88]Alright, here we go.
[406:44.54]Roger, it seems that they made it into the store.
[406:47.53]I'm not sure.
[406:48.25]I'm not sure what they're after.
[407:10.50]Alright, it's Block XR2, right?
[407:13.94]Are these guys Urkais?
[407:19.31]Are they... I don't have the Urkai one, though.
[407:40.12]I'm just gonna snipe people.
[407:49.33]If I do any other move.
[408:03.32]I mean, I know I have combos, but it's kind of hard to even see what direction my weapon is even swinging.
[408:13.23]I could block, square, you know, our XR2.
[408:15.68]I got the Battle of Home Depot in front of me.
[408:40.23]Get rid of all the shields.
[408:41.17]That didn't kill you?
[408:46.59]Alright, here we go.
[408:48.63]Legolas.
[408:52.98]Coming.
[408:55.00]Gate's in good shape.
[408:57.82]I thought he had zero health for a second.
[408:58.96]I was about to say, did I get bugged?
[409:13.52]Good.
[409:15.43]Good.
[409:17.03]Good.
[409:19.13]Good.
[409:22.63]Argon!
[409:26.15]My axe and my bow and my axe and my bow and my bow.
[409:39.89]You're standing in the way, you fuckface.
[409:57.42]He's still playing this?
[409:58.76]Yup.
[410:01.58]He ain't ever gonna stop.
[410:11.71]Perfect.
[410:12.05]Come on.
[410:12.33]I gotta spring this together right now.
[410:13.51]I need this.
[410:20.98]Pretty good.
[410:21.62]Pretty good spring.
[410:46.97]I gotta start shooting the boat when I get perfect.
[411:04.77]Boat!
[411:05.11]Boat!
[411:07.87]Watchers on the walls!
[411:16.12]Can I get a camera change, you bugged-ass piece of shit?
[411:26.75]Go go go go go go go go go go go go!
[411:39.78]That guy just dropped the meteor.
[411:45.98]Okay.
[411:57.49]I'm fucking coming to see... I think that's it.
[412:01.95]That's it.
[412:02.21]That's it.
[412:02.41]That's it.
[412:03.31]Back down.
[412:03.61]Back down.
[412:04.01]Back down the stairs.
[412:22.75]Back to this fucking mess.
[412:31.44]Oh, he's even attacking!
[412:45.42]Get in there and fucking hit somebody!
[412:51.68]Like, this is... Do it!
[412:55.81]Oh, no.
[412:57.55]Aragorn technique.
[413:05.42]Quickly.
[413:09.78]What is over here?
[413:11.22]They're about to smash the barricade!
[413:18.18]Roger, it seems that the guy playing Gmod spawned two antlions.
[413:25.09]We can't really see anywhere.
[413:28.71]I have no view of anything, actually, Roger.
[413:35.57]There's a whole lot of noise.
[413:38.43]Looks like they're going to get through the gate again.
[413:54.33]Don't let him do it!
[413:55.55]Roger, don't let him!
[413:57.64]Roger, don't change the channel!
[414:25.48]Oh, no.
[414:26.78]I think I have to, uh... I think I have to... Whatever, they got in.
[414:33.14]We tried.
[414:51.69]Sauron wins.
[414:54.03]How do we even know?
[414:55.11]How do we know Sauron's gonna be that bad?
[414:57.97]Right?
[414:58.48]What if he just, what if he's... Ah, he's a murderer, isn't he?
[415:06.50]Didn't Saruman say, like, let me tell you something.
[415:13.65]Sauron.
[415:15.65]What's the, what's the Christopher Lee line that he says?
[415:18.11]End of.
[415:20.30]Sauron and you.
[415:21.54]Sauron is one of the most disgusting, horrible men in the world.
[415:26.15]Join me and together we will destroy the... Sauron.
[415:30.49]This is an S word.
[415:31.35]Sith.
[415:32.11]Together we will destroy the Sith.
[415:33.69]He's in another movie.
[415:43.84]What a fucking phenomenal actor, by the way.
[416:00.89]Block.
[416:05.71]This shit don't work.
[416:16.82]Do or do not do.
[416:18.24]There is no try.
[416:19.16]I have no idea what's going on.
[416:24.08]I don't think 5,500 people know what's going on.
[416:41.35]Hey, you ready for the nearly impossible level?
[416:46.41]I guess so!
[416:48.77]I guess so!
[417:02.79]I'll be honest though, like imagine watching Lord of the Rings and Aragorn drops on his ass this many times.
[417:06.86]You'd be like, this movie sucks.
[417:10.38]Look at how many times I'm just getting knocked on the ground.
[417:13.37]This is what it looks like when you fail every QTE.
[417:47.92]Okay, get it get it get it get it get I have a perfect you should be dead I'm coming coming coming coming.
[417:54.54]Okay, let's get rid of the uh, Thanks, I just got hit by a bomb Archer's behind.
[418:07.47]I don't think that happens yet.
[418:08.23]I think I have to go back down here first
[418:13.42]Can we skip this game, please?
[418:17.45]You're ten and a half hours late.
[418:26.39]I'm sorry, but you're ten and a half hours late.
[418:34.08]We're in two helms deep right now.
[418:35.40]You're right.
[418:40.92]This shit's going down.
[419:00.77]This used to be a fellowship stream and then it turned into a beat the entire second game stream.
[419:24.13]How can there be this many people?
[419:34.12]Where are the archers?
[419:38.15]Thank you.
[419:43.95]Legolas, you fucking ruined everything.
[419:59.65]Archers.
[420:01.34]Archers!
[420:06.32]Somebody deal with this guy.
[420:08.88]Hot shot!
[420:15.68]Shot!
[420:16.82]Back to the gate.
[420:29.35]Smooth it out in fucking paint.
[420:30.49]God damn it, give me a break.
[420:33.73]Where's the content blend tool in Photoshop?
[420:36.82]You need it!
[420:51.27]I can't even get these motherfuckers off this gate!
[420:56.64]They're like just insects!
[420:59.98]They're just bugs everywhere, you can't get rid of them!
[421:18.10]Clear the gate!
[421:18.82]Okay, he got the trolls?
[421:20.70]Are these the trolls or did we lose?
[421:23.06]Trolls, go!
[421:23.90]I have to go triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle.
[421:33.18]They're gonna break through.
[421:39.16]I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[421:43.48]Like, how, what, in the fucking name of God, what this, this is unbelievable.
[421:51.82]Holy shit.
[422:09.16]I did better when I was 12.
[422:13.65]Get the fuck outta here!
[422:16.73]Don't!
[422:18.29]They're just trying to get under your skin!
[422:23.35]I need to do another level.
[422:24.37]Like, this is, this is just, this is fucking, this is ridiculous.
[422:27.58]It's absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[422:29.20]There's, there's no way I'm doing this with another, at least two levels.
[422:33.36]Absolute zero.
[422:35.38]I'm not gonna stop the fucking breach of Home Depot.
[422:37.26]It's never gonna fucking happen.
[422:41.00]What level have I not done with Aragorn?
[422:46.76]These two.
[422:47.62]The Westfold?
[422:48.32]Which one of these... Oh, these suck.
[422:53.01]You lost to the Battle of Home Depot.
[423:00.41]Alright, so imagine me playing.
[423:02.23]I can't really imagine what it's like watching.
[423:12.17]I imagine you have, like, to put on glasses and lean in and squint and go, oh, there are, yeah, there he is, somewhere in there.
[423:25.24]Like the beef jerky kicked in?
[423:26.54]It's okay to lose.
[423:28.96]I mean, I have many, many times tonight.
[423:42.26]many, many times.
[423:47.99]Oh, this shit.
[423:48.49]I should be able to do this pretty cleanly with Aragorn.
[423:51.37]Camera.
[423:51.61]Quantum computing.
[424:14.12]Three shots?
[424:33.81]Three.
[424:36.08]You have to beat the game to unlock the cheat menu.
[424:38.90]I don't think I'll be doing that.
[424:49.33]How is this streamer so bad?
[424:53.82]You can't pull that one.
[424:55.64]That's too easy.
[424:57.32]That was six hours ago easy.
[425:00.12]It was six hours ago easy.
[425:01.28]Come on.
[425:03.53]You gotta give me some ten and a half hour material here.
[425:09.37]They're coming for us!
[425:27.29]I gotta unlock the other weapon thing.
[425:30.16]Oh, that guy has an explosive.
[425:36.76]Am I shooting over people?
[425:39.20]Am I about to get real mad?
[425:48.11]This stream is real late.
[425:49.03]Yeah, you get a double feature today.
[426:00.30]You got Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring for about three hours.
[426:04.22]And then you've gotten this suffering for the last, like, nine.
[426:25.20]All it costed was one of your friends.
[426:27.30]All it costed was a friendship with somebody.
[426:29.69]What do you mean?
[426:30.85]We're friends.
[426:43.58]Fucking shield enemies.
[426:45.20]Like... You just bounce off these motherfuckers, man.
[426:50.64]There's always at least three guys with a shield, and you're going to bounce off them.
[426:58.43]It's just... It hurts me.
[427:01.31]On the inside.
[427:02.01]It hurts me.
[427:09.80]Poor Joel.
[427:10.67]Joel's fine.
[427:12.61]Joel hit me up and said, yo, hey, we can do this another time.
[427:16.81]How about tomorrow?
[427:17.43]And I was like, yeah, let's do it tomorrow.
[427:19.89]Hi, everybody.
[427:20.43]My name is Jerma985.
[427:21.43]I thought this stream was going to be four and a half hours long.
[427:26.92]Just hanging out.
[427:27.82]Me, you know, crossing almost 11 hours.
[427:41.04]I thought this was gonna be a short one today.
[427:42.63]We're just gonna check out the Lord of the Rings on PlayStation 2.
[427:46.51]What do you know about that?
[427:47.87]Whatever.
[427:49.09]Somebody said, you're never gonna get past the first part of this.
[427:52.50]Really?
[427:52.84]Yes, I will.
[428:14.98]Remember, it's Monday morning.
[428:17.08]This ain't even my longest stream.
[428:18.44]Everybody, don't worry.
[428:19.14]Relax.
[428:25.49]You must like the game.
[428:26.49]I do.
[428:29.79]Alright, I leveled up.
[428:40.90]Level 9.
[428:41.34]Level 9.
[428:43.68]I'm just going to get over... I'm not going to die from an explosion.
[428:45.50]I'm just going to get over here.
[428:52.02]Let's blow up.
[428:55.45]Thank you.
[428:55.97]I had the invincibility frames from being on the ground.
[428:58.09]Worked out perfectly.
[428:58.89]You said Simpsons Hit and Run was a great game, too.
[429:03.87]Yeah.
[429:04.56]And?
[429:06.64]What's your point?
[429:23.80]Do Return of the King.
[429:26.77]I'm going to do Return of the King, just not immediately.
[429:28.79]The point is you're a masochist.
[429:30.37]I don't know about that.
[429:32.47]Am I?
[429:54.23]It only costs 200 bits for him to spend 10 hours on a game.
[430:04.82]This does all stem from just one person saying that they... Alright.
[430:15.60]What do we got here?
[430:17.50]Gondor bow.
[430:18.24]This is the best bow I can possibly buy.
[430:22.34]And then I want one of these super moves.
[430:25.30]Use against a powerful foe to smash his shield, knock him to the ground, and strike him.
[430:30.80]Triangle, triangle, oink, triangle.
[430:37.80]This is the one.
[430:42.87]And... I can't reliably do this shit.
[430:46.25]Very effective for dispatching shielded enemies is... Wait, hold on.
[430:48.43]What about this one?
[430:52.25]This is triangle, X, X, triangle.
[430:58.03]Sildor and Gondor.
[431:08.00]Yeah, the bow.
[431:10.08]Bow.
[431:11.22]Best bow in the game.
[431:12.78]We're done.
[431:14.72]I can't get this bane to work.
[431:16.80]I'm too bad.
[431:17.82]I can't do it.
[431:18.70]I get the best bow in the game.
[431:20.92]It's triangle.
[431:24.79]We're just gonna smash the fuck out of everybody.
[431:28.38]Triangle, triangle, circle, triangle.
[431:30.04]This is just power.
[431:31.26]Power, power, power, power, power.
[431:36.95]I do have an oh shit moment where I can get to level 10 if I need to.
[431:48.80]There's one more level I didn't do.
[431:50.10]It's the one where everyone's burning in the building.
[432:00.66]The battle for Home Depot.
[432:05.38]Hold on, I... Let me get, let me just get this, let me get this done while I'm locked in.
[432:15.66]I'm locked in here.
[432:20.49]I thought that just said unemployed.
[432:22.45]Aragorn, unemployed.
[432:23.49]Legolas, unemployed.
[432:24.53]Gimli, unemployed.
[432:25.53]That's rough, okay.
[432:35.93]Didn't you start the stream this morning?
[432:38.01]Like 2 o'clock Pacific?
[432:42.90]I've taken a couple breaks, so don't worry.
[432:44.80]I've taken like two or three breaks, had a bunch of water.
[432:47.06]I've eaten.
[432:47.92]I've had my nice big meaty beef jerky snack.
[432:53.96]Let's go.
[433:29.15]It's still hard to tell where I am.
[433:48.54]I think I'm doing it!
[434:00.02]I'm the guy that wrote the book.
[434:22.33]Okay, good.
[434:28.84]Tolkien's a token in the chat Playing Lord of the Rings I see
[435:15.56]Pog.
[435:16.58]Whoa, Pog.
[435:20.48]Legolas, you are worthless.
[435:22.50]Worthless.
[435:23.64]Worthless.
[435:24.14]Worthless.
[435:24.62]Worthless.
[435:25.14]Worthless.
[435:25.86]Worthless.
[435:34.40]Archer show up immediately after saving Legolas.
[435:36.44]They're not there right now.
[435:42.50]Archer!
[435:43.70]Shambles!
[435:45.66]There's nobody to target back there.
[435:50.55]There's nobody back there.
[435:53.59]He yells archers on the wall.
[436:09.36]Anybody getting any of that?
[436:10.52]Anybody getting any of this?
[436:32.38]Can you repeat that?
[436:33.08]There's no rhyme or reason to anything on the screen.
[436:44.35]I might as well just fucking put the controller down and just like walk away.
[436:49.01]Archers on the walls?
[436:49.89]He didn't even say it.
[436:50.57]Did he say it?
[436:57.89]They're not up there Dude this gate is doing so much worse than it was before
[437:22.71]Keep it up, Jerma.
[437:23.39]You can do it.
[437:23.89]I'll probably do it, but it's just throwing dice in the air.
[437:27.81]This entire last level is just whip 400 dice in the air.
[437:31.36]Did you get a 92?
[437:31.96]Do it again.
[437:34.34]Oh, try again.
[437:51.36]Arches up on that ball Get camera man, please change the camera
[438:23.87]Those trolls are getting in.
[438:28.90]That's it.
[438:33.08]Jeremy, the gates!
[438:33.87]Jeremy, the gates!
[438:34.69]I can't even walk forward.
[438:39.53]Oy yoy yoy.
[438:41.21]Oy yoy yoy.
[438:58.73]Fuck this fuck this shit man.
[439:02.47]I'm dead I think I have to just get to level.
[439:18.95]Oh my god Why
[439:29.38]Just get in the middle and do the tornado.
[439:30.80]That's kind of what I did and it didn't really help.
[439:35.95]Work your way from the sides.
[439:41.97]I'm going to get rug burn on my arms from my chair.
[439:46.11]Well, it's hard to not be in the middle when you start in the middle.
[439:54.94]We're inside the key.
[439:55.94]We're due.
[440:26.67]I thought that was a death sound.
[440:42.32]When it's perfect, you just gotta snipe.
[441:09.85]I imagine just opening the game Imagine opening this and the first thing you see is like Don't you think you immediately click the X
[441:38.13]Or he'd be like, holy shit, it's like GDQ wrapping up?
[441:41.01]Like, hold on.
[442:02.64]I'm on- I'm in perfect!
[442:04.74]Is he out of his zone to be able to die?! !
[442:08.93]That's supposed to be a one-hit kill, bro!
[442:11.54]You used the arrows in perfect?
[442:28.29]Yeah, I know.
[442:29.17]I know I should be doing it.
[442:39.98]Down.
[442:41.26]Alright, same deal.
[442:41.80]Let's go.
[442:51.82]Where?
[442:53.10]I don't... Where am I standing?
[442:56.16]There's a health over here.
[442:57.78]I can't see anything.
[443:01.66]Give me that foil.
[443:06.38]Perfect.
[443:06.72]Let's just shoot arrows at people.
[443:12.08]Doing a great job keep it up thumbs up wink.
[443:13.34]Oh
[443:53.70]Archer!
[444:15.38]This game has an average playtime of six hours for the main story.
[444:17.95]Fuck that.
[444:20.15]Yeah, right.
[444:21.67]Liars.
[444:22.35]Bullshit.
[444:22.81]You've seen.
[444:24.36]Look at what's happening on screen right now.
[444:26.28]And you think somebody's gonna beat this in less than five or six hours?
[444:46.41]That's horse shit.
[444:49.83]What happened to that guy?
[444:51.31]Alright, are they dead?
[444:53.47]I can't even fucking look, man.
[444:55.43]Five hours, fuck off.
[444:57.66]Five hours, fuck off with that.
[444:59.88]Not a chance in hell.
[445:13.17]He's a Gimli main, that's why.
[445:20.17]It's like all super powered fucking orcs at the gate right now.
[445:25.18]Do you understand?
[445:27.70]Like, it's all these super powered motherfuckers.
[445:35.41]Five hours, by the way.
[445:36.75]This is like playing Dark Souls against 60 people at the same fucking time.
[445:44.79]No way, you took five hours to beat this.
[445:49.59]I refuse to understand or believe you.
[446:03.52]I have to get to level 10 or it's actually impossible.
[446:21.56]How will level 10 fix it?
[446:23.20]I don't know.
[446:24.34]It gets me away from having to see the same smudged, smeared across screen of a hundred people swinging and falling down.
[446:35.11]Break it up a little.
[446:36.09]Somebody said back when games were hard.
[446:59.31]Back when games were hard.
[447:17.16]Just do combos?
[447:18.28]I'm doing the two or three combos that I have.
[447:21.90]Here are my combos.
[447:22.70]Here's the other one.
[447:29.89]You've seen me do that move 500 times.
[447:34.90]The walkthrough for this level starts with, oh my sweet loving god, this mission is so hard, it makes the previous two missions look easy.
[447:43.87]Why is he not... Let's go!
[447:46.87]You're wasting time, Gandalf!
[447:58.92]How did you beat this as a kid?
[448:01.26]Guys, I may have just gotten to like the second level.
[448:05.34]And gone, well, this is fun.
[448:06.88]I like Lord of the Rings.
[448:20.55]Sorry about your tables.
[448:31.12]I've leveled up everything and I can't even kill a standard uruk-hai with a couple of slashes But you just don't have
[448:58.76]Old man, get out of my... Move, move, move, move, move!
[449:18.21]Oh sorry, we have to get in the way!
[449:42.82]Slot this motherfucker.
[449:45.78]I think I'm stuck in the wall.
[449:51.79]I'm stuck in the wall.
[449:53.71]Here we go.
[449:54.15]I found a way out.
[450:04.30]That's what I wanted so I can kill you in one hit.
[450:06.08]Go!
[450:06.14]Is this hit and run too?
[450:23.02]It might as well be.
[450:23.78]This might be harder than hit and run.
[450:33.46]We're almost at the whole trilogy.
[450:36.85]Almost.
[450:40.85]Why is there a family photo in the top right corner?
[450:42.65]Because I have to save the people in the building.
[450:53.26]We've peaked too early in the year.
[450:55.18]What do you mean we peaked too early?
[450:56.54]Alright, I have to... Oh, no, no, no.
[450:57.80]They're going to die if I don't do this right now.
[451:19.29]God fucking damn it.
[451:23.85]They swing so much faster than I do.
[451:27.24]And the family's dead.
[451:28.94]Where are these family members?
[451:31.72]Where are you?
[451:33.50]Are you just standing around waiting to die?
[451:36.38]Where even are you?
[451:37.58]Did you just let these guys kill you?
[451:42.13]Walking doesn't do anything.
[451:47.21]Trust me.
[451:48.83]Trust me.
[451:50.09]When you block, you just... It's easy.
[452:01.14]You can block against one guy, but when you're surrounded by 12 people, you're gonna get smoked.
[452:11.97]I just dropped my mouse.
[452:13.09]Who cares?
[452:13.69]Not even level 10, by the way.
[452:16.29]Do I get my upgrade screen?
[452:40.90]Alright, what the hell am I buying?
[452:45.74]But look at how long this move takes to kill one person.
[452:50.44]One.
[452:51.38]Two.
[452:52.32]Three.
[452:53.36]Four.
[452:54.14]It's almost five full seconds.
[453:00.17]It's an instant kill, but it takes... I'm doing it.
[453:03.35]I got it.
[453:03.57]There you go.
[453:03.83]I got it.
[453:12.44]How am I gonna pull this off in this sea of fucking humans?
[453:20.00]Don't you guys remember the Hobbit sneaking game?
[453:21.78]What happened to that?
[453:33.51]So I can instant kill an Uruk-hai and instant kill any orc in the whole game.
[453:38.08]I have to block, press X, and then R2.
[453:41.54]It should instantly kill every single orb in the whole game.
[453:48.14]I'll try.
[453:50.06]I probably should have picked another level to practice it.
[454:00.29]We cannot hold them!
[454:06.50]You didn't yell fake Grumbo's name.
[454:08.04]Fake Grumbo!
[454:14.06]Okay, so... Block and then X, R2.
[454:16.94]Okay.
[454:29.12]Do you see how long this is going to take to do this to every single one of these guys one by one?
[454:54.67]Glad I picked it.
[454:56.79]Nah, it's a waste of time.
[455:09.54]I'm gonna do what I was doing before.
[455:58.25]He's hitting with the backswing.
[455:59.85]Now that's just annoying.
[456:05.47]I'm damaging the gate with my moves?
[456:09.21]What?
[456:13.29]No, I'm not.
[456:14.57]No way.
[456:21.02]Just run.
[456:50.24]Why are you still alive?
[456:59.04]Move, move, move.
[457:08.92]Jeremiah's gonna defend Helm's Deep for five full days.
[457:16.19]You know what would be nice?
[457:19.24]The kingdom of men, dwarves, and elves.
[457:21.71]If you sent more than three people.
[457:24.51]That'd be great.
[458:10.89]Oh, we're being attacked.
[458:12.01]We're being overrun by orcs.
[458:14.53]It's okay.
[458:14.89]We have three people.
[458:18.08]Oh, how many were there?
[458:19.98]Sorry, Gandalf.
[458:21.20]What were there?
[458:22.86]600 million fucking orcs?
[458:25.08]Oh, yeah.
[458:25.49]Don't worry.
[458:25.83]We'll just have three people that do this.
[458:42.32]Hey, we did it in 300.
[458:42.81]I'd like 300.
[458:43.03]Somewhere.
[459:11.72]And when I try to block, no one attacks.
[459:15.17]Did you see that?
[459:16.69]Did you see that one?
[459:18.25]I'm sitting there like spamming the block button and everybody stands still.
[459:23.99]Archers on the wall.
[459:25.25]You got it, Gimli.
[459:26.46]Coming right up.
[459:27.04]I'll take care of that.
[459:27.86]Just let me follow this real quick over here.
[459:38.84]Jesus Christ.
[459:49.43]Doing better than last time, though.
[459:54.39]By the way, I'm breaking the disk in half when I'm done.
[459:55.95]Oh, by the way, the second I get to the last minute of the cutscene, I'm gonna break the disk in half with my teeth.
[460:42.47]Every single motherfucker has a fucking shield.
[460:46.68]Oh, slow down, Jeremy.
[460:49.73]I can't even do a combo in here.
[461:11.52]Did anyone beat this?
[461:24.28]Did anyone beat this?
[461:26.46]And I mean literally one person.
[461:28.90]One person on Earth.
[461:45.46]You can't block that.
[461:46.40]You can't do anything.
[461:48.78]Do I have to stand?
[461:49.68]Oh my god.
[461:56.20]Hey, just watch the speedrun.
[462:05.95]To figure out how to play the game normally.
[462:09.96]Sounds about right.
[462:18.27]You thought Jump King was hard?
[462:19.66]All these fucking like dragged out 12 minute sequences of the same thing over and over again.
[462:31.97]I don't feel like Aragorn right now.
[462:34.79]I feel like I'm in the dryer.
[462:59.65]Crazy Bill!
[463:13.80]Fuck that move!
[463:15.26]It's like a lantern in the way!
[463:40.99]Instant kill pauses AI but it doesn't pause people hitting the shelf with their swords I'll come and get you I'm coming with my little sword
[464:11.16]This cost is three hundred dollars at galaxy's edge And you can't even play with it because it's made out of glass Step step step and head
[464:41.03]Stabbing head.
[464:42.05]Okay, go.
[464:59.89]Use the insta-kill.
[465:00.79]Use the insta-kill.
[465:01.51]It'll save you.
[465:13.45]No, I'm going.
[465:13.95]Here we go.
[465:17.12]It's these Uruk-hai's.
[465:19.18]You gotta get over here before they get in.
[465:34.55]Alright, just figured out where I was.
[466:00.22]I don't even know.
[466:02.58]I have no idea.
[466:07.48]I'm truly gone at this point.
[466:13.68]Am I getting perfect somehow?
[466:39.46]I'll chase down the wall, let's go!
[466:46.36]Oh my god, you fucker.
[466:49.12]You motherfucker.
[466:50.85]He's still chasing me.
[466:51.95]No, that's just useless Legolas.
[466:56.21]He's still chasing me.
[466:59.45]Scratch that!
[467:00.51]You know, I'd like it if they send more... Three characters, I'd like it if they send more than one.
[467:06.31]Me.
[467:12.56]That's it.
[467:12.82]Is there any more?
[467:13.62]I think that's it.
[467:15.34]That's it.
[467:15.66]That's it.
[467:15.94]That's it.
[467:16.26]Let's go.
[467:28.07]It's the same guy with the shield still following me.
[467:30.53]No one will kill him.
[467:40.19]Same fucking thing happens with super-powered fucking mutants.
[467:45.66]Look, there's like ten of these guys.
[467:47.54]They're like unstoppable.
[467:50.32]It's the hardest enemy in the game and they're like just lining up.
[467:56.61]They're super mutants.
[467:58.83]If only I had an instant kill.
[468:09.91]It's so- oh, just do the instant kill!
[468:11.45]I can't even tell what's happening on the screen!
[468:13.54]It's this one fucking guy!
[468:19.58]The guys that you can't kill!
[468:22.84]You can't swing at these guys!
[468:25.76]Where am I?
[468:31.29]What the fuck is happening?
[468:37.11]This is out fucking Breach.
[468:40.27]This is out.
[468:41.37]This is worse than Garry's Mod.
[468:43.82]Garry's Mod, this shit can't even happen.
[468:46.34]There's like AI ceilings.
[468:50.04]There's literally AI ceilings in Garry's Mod.
[468:53.26]Too many processes going on at the same time.
[468:57.87]Imagine playing this on anything other than normal.
[469:03.35]Holy fuck-oly.
[469:18.60]Here come the trolls to break it down easily.
[469:20.90]Stick to the plan.
[469:21.44]There is no plan.
[469:22.68]You can't have a plan when there's a hundred people spamming moves.
[469:26.00]Spamming at you on the screen.
[469:27.30]There's no plan.
[469:28.90]There is no plan.
[469:30.44]Where are the trolls?
[469:34.48]Where are the trolls?
[469:48.84]Where are the trolls?
[469:51.34]Did I... Can you imagine putting it on this?
[470:06.53]What on Earth would you have it on there for?
[470:10.45]You want to just do it for once?
[470:13.21]Just try it?
[470:13.61]Let's try it.
[470:34.12]Let's see what happens when the game's on expert.
[470:37.73]Do they swing twice as fast?
[470:38.89]Do they have twice as much health?
[470:41.29]Does the wall have 50% left health?
[471:01.00]The only thing I notice is the frame rate is worse.
[471:06.64]You can't... The shield doesn't break in one hit.
[471:29.40]What kind of mistake is that?
[471:30.64]You know what I'm saying?
[471:42.45]It's a shield.
[471:43.67]What kind of mistake?
[472:08.50]Why have I not taken a single point of damage?
[472:11.46]And now I have.
[472:30.52]Paragon, you suck.
[472:34.59]That's my favorite scene in Lord of the Rings where Aragorn fell down every half second.
[472:39.42]And when he spams square in the middle of people like this.
[473:21.86]He's already... Are you gonna kill him before I can get over there?
[473:48.14]I love this movie.
[473:50.50]I love this movie I don't even know what he said
[474:15.94]Wisp, Roto, I don't know, probably dead.
[474:22.07]No one's checked on him in a while.
[474:24.01]Who knows where he is?
[474:40.98]He's retired.
[475:06.44]Archers!
[475:15.28]This scene's longer than I remember.
[475:16.72]I don't remember there being a 45 minute Helm's Deep scene in the movie.
[475:22.10]I can't even, like, get over here.
[475:32.34]This is like pushing your fucking face into quicksand, is what this feels like.
[475:37.90]I am smushing my face into quicksand.
[475:53.18]Actually, quicksand would probably feel better than this.
[475:59.74]It's simulating how Helm's Deep was.
[476:16.79]Why these now all of a sudden take two hits okay, it's on fucking expert Is that it That's it
[476:34.25]Alright, come on, clean it up.
[476:35.27]Pick up the trolls.
[476:49.74]Oh, here come the super mutants!
[477:12.90]Swing at me!
[477:13.34]Swing at me!
[477:25.39]Alright, if I seriously hear the Here Comes the Sith song again, I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[477:46.15]Take out the trolls!
[477:46.63]Take out the trolls!
[477:50.39]What you're about to hear is some encouragement to let you know that... They're about to smash the barricade!
[478:47.73]Those are the options, fucking many.
[479:17.73]Did any- did they- did they- did anybody test this level?
[479:34.04]Were they under like a large amount of- like get it out!
[479:49.84]An 11-year-old Destiny.
[479:56.16]Just swing the sword!
[479:58.54]I feel like the trolls was, like, just a little too much.
[480:04.03]Or, like, why can't I... Okay, if I'm in that board meeting with WB... Who the fuck it was?
[480:10.59]Hey, um, maybe this shouldn't be a nine and a half minute segment.
[480:15.39]Maybe make it six and bring the troll- make one troll out.
[480:18.84]That would be funner.
[480:28.54]The trolls are the easiest part of the level.
[480:30.36]I mean, when they- I can't seem to- I can't get near- Dude, kids are fucking crazy.
[480:43.31]Kids can beat this shit.
[480:46.00]I want to see the, like, lightning IQ that it would take to truly do this.
[480:51.29]In a timely manner.
[480:52.91]Not even lightning IQ.
[480:54.29]You're superhuman.
[480:59.99]Go take a blood test, and I guarantee you your vitamin D levels are at 100%.
[481:04.14]They have to be.
[481:05.88]I bet you you have vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin B3, omega 3 and omega 6.
[481:10.80]You're probably at 100% of all those.
[481:13.10]God, you fucking superhuman.
[481:22.38]You're a vitamin D deficient asshole.
[481:24.82]Shut up.
[481:26.94]Shut up.
[481:27.98]Alright, I'm lashing out.
[481:30.74]I'm lashing out now.
[481:31.70]It's been almost 12 hours.
[481:32.82]I'm lashing out.
[481:34.16]How dare you.
[481:36.40]How dare you say that.
[481:37.84]Vitamin B.
[482:05.14]I'm going.
[482:07.24]I'm going.
[482:09.42]I wish somebody would protect the gate while I was gone.
[482:11.34]That guy is a statue.
[482:13.28]He's made out of fucking stone.
[482:14.74]I had to just look at it.
[482:29.04]Get him on the stairs.
[482:39.56]Get him on the stairs.
[482:44.36]What a terrible RNG this is.
[482:47.13]Just, just, just, just terrible.
[482:57.25]You're on the front page of Twitch.
[483:06.17]I'm on the front page of Twitch right now?
[483:09.73]Am I seriously?
[483:10.49]Oh no, what a bad time to be on the front page.
[483:14.82]Hey!
[483:16.76]I can't even hide it.
[483:17.52]I'm so fucked.
[483:19.50]Hey, guys!
[483:20.48]This is, uh...
[483:23.99]playing Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the fucking Home Depot battle.
[483:31.84]We are just, this is a tricky part of the game, where it simulates smashing your head into a wall as hard as you can, spinning around a circle ten times, and then picking up a PlayStation 2 controller and trying to play.
[483:53.58]That's in the death diary.
[484:02.97]Okay.
[484:05.03]That guy was already dead.
[484:14.61]Hit the guy's attacking the door.
[484:15.69]Yeah, but what happens when there's a guy attacking the door and a guy attacking behind me, a guy attacking on my left, right, forward?
[484:21.71]The whole clock is taken up right now.
[484:23.48]You see how many dings that was?
[484:24.96]The entire clock.
[484:26.92]It's not like, oh, watch like six o'clock.
[484:28.48]No, watch all clocks.
[484:30.31]Watch every clock at the same time.
[484:49.16]The AI actually fucking stops.
[484:52.82]Why did he do that second part?
[484:58.40]They're still- they're still- the archers didn't stop.
[485:07.55]The archers keep going.
[485:11.69]Same-
[485:19.49]Oh, you f- Legolas.
[485:21.53]Don't fucking do anything for me.
[485:27.39]Oh my fucking god.
[485:29.51]Why would- Why would this- What is this segment?
[485:33.91]What is this segment that I'm playing?
[485:36.30]What is this segment I'm playing?
[485:39.62]What is this segment?
[485:43.30]Archers!
[485:43.74]They're five feet away from you!
[486:01.76]It does the second- I didn't even press that button.
[486:03.44]It's doing it a second time.
[486:26.61]Didn't you say this is one of the best games ever made?
[486:28.67]Oh, that was a lie.
[486:31.04]That was a mistake.
[486:42.15]He said it was the best PS2 game.
[486:43.73]No, God of War 2 is.
[486:45.71]Okay?
[486:59.74]I can't even fucking move.
[487:02.77]I can't even move, mate.
[487:05.17]I can't even move.
[487:06.53]It's this camera.
[487:08.63]This camera.
[487:10.05]Kill him.
[487:11.15]Kill.
[487:12.09]Kill him.
[487:12.85]He's almost dead.
[487:16.98]Oh.
[487:17.10]Oh.
[487:37.29]I can't put it on easy mode.
[487:39.11]Alright, if we get to 12 hours and I still haven't done it, I'll put it on easy mode.
[487:43.68]I don't care anymore.
[487:45.10]I don't give a shit about this anymore.
[487:49.22]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no!
[487:51.88]I didn't beat Lord of the Rings 2 Tower in a PlayStation 2.
[487:55.20]I'm normal.
[487:58.33]I'm soiled.
[488:51.19]Don't fuckin' let him attack the goddamn wall unattended!
[489:24.78]Get off the Aragorn!
[489:27.78]Move, move, move, move, move, move.
[489:36.90]Move, controllers.
[489:38.78]That guy ran by real fast.
[489:46.54]Why are you almost dead?
[489:56.34]Legolas don't die on the air, man!
[490:11.03]Oh, let me just take all my HP and die.
[490:23.04]This game has broken him.
[490:24.27]Oh, I'm in half.
[490:26.67]I'm in half, but both halves are still alive.
[490:28.83]And there's still one... One half is holding one side of the controller.
[490:32.65]The other half is holding the other side.
[490:33.63]And they're working together.
[490:36.03]Is somebody hacking in my game?
[490:37.87]There's like a speed hacker in here.
[491:15.86]Fucking Jesus, man.
[491:18.52]Children.
[491:20.00]Their brains would have exploded if they had touched this.
[491:23.56]Keep your kids away from this game.
[491:24.66]Don't let them play it.
[491:29.83]They'll end up with like a deficiency in fucking vitamin something.
[491:33.87]Why am I on the vitamin thing?
[491:36.17]Why am I on the vitamin thing?
[491:57.35]This is just no hope for this level.
[492:02.32]Eat your Flintstone gummies.
[492:03.30]Don't eat those.
[492:03.84]Those are radioactive.
[492:10.52]Oh, sorry.
[492:10.80]That's bananas, right, guys?
[492:45.62]It's not even hitting anything.
[492:52.76]No archers?
[492:54.04]Where are the archers?
[492:55.78]Did I already get them?
[492:57.30]What am I waiting for here?
[493:08.36]Alright.
[493:18.25]It's just, they take so much damage.
[493:20.47]I feel like I'm doing a MMO dungeon that's a five-player dungeon by myself.
[493:33.00]Okay, that didn't... Like, oh shit, the timer really shouldn't be down this far, but there's supposed to be ten people here.
[493:55.54]Square X R2!
[493:56.20]Square X R2!
[493:57.22]I don't know who I'm aiming at.
[494:02.19]This is where the camera just decides that it just don't give a fuck no more.
[494:05.69]Here we go.
[494:06.45]Like, we're gonna shake the screen and who gives a shit?
[494:08.80]People are floating around.
[494:09.74]Who gives a fuck, right?
[494:34.55]Oh, God.
[494:35.39]It's already, like, dead.
[494:38.89]There's no help!
[494:40.79]There's so many!
[494:42.85]I have to spam square or I die!
[494:53.04]There's no way it stands!
[494:54.38]There's no way it stands!
[494:55.56]It's over!
[495:05.01]focus on the gate it's real hard to do that when the screen is shaking and the screen is filled with bodies like I can't even it's just it's like 10 out of 10 out fucking rage just cheese it stand on the stairs okay
[495:32.78]Do I actually have to break the game's code to play the game normally?
[495:38.08]I have to break the game to play the fucking video game normally.
[495:44.54]Holy shit in my pants.
[495:50.88]Fill my... Stay on the stairs.
[496:05.29]What happens on the stairs?
[496:12.75]Uh, this ain't working.
[496:22.38]Shoot towards the gate?
[496:23.94]I mean, the gate's already almost at like 5% health.
[496:25.96]Uh...
[496:32.97]Well, I've turned off my friendly AI, so that helps.
[497:07.53]Get rising attack.
[497:10.29]I don't think that's gonna help me though.
[497:11.71]Alright, let's try the stairs again.
[497:16.76]Stay on the stairs.
[497:18.78]I have to get ammo for my bow?
[497:20.70]What?
[497:23.10]These are wrong stairs.
[503:29.32]Try the orc insta-kill more.
[503:30.58]It's just so hard to do when you're being spammed by people in a circle.
[503:35.00]It's, it's... Oh, block somebody and then press X and R too.
[503:37.70]But what?
[503:38.28]You don't even know who you're doing it to.
[503:40.02]You don't even know who the fuck you're doing it to.
[504:09.98]I thought the stream ended hours ago.
[504:11.20]No, I'm still at... What did the guide say?
[504:16.74]The nearly impossible level.
[504:19.69]Still here.
[504:31.09]Kefe laugh.
[504:35.65]Stay on the second floor.
[504:36.57]Alright.
[504:40.76]Try to get him down here.
[504:41.72]Alright, Legolas, get down here.
[504:50.01]Come on.
[504:56.64]If they just continue to spawn up here, they might.
[504:58.26]Because he's not going anywhere.
[505:12.23]He's not coming down.
[505:14.17]He's literally not gonna come down these stairs.
[505:17.03]They just spawn!
[505:29.50]Just stay up here until he archers.
[505:57.38]Is that fucking gonna happen?
[506:02.96]Or what, Gimli?
[506:05.82]You gonna scream my name or what?
[506:36.72]Great camera.
[506:38.07]It's fantastic.
[506:39.73]It's the best I've ever seen in a video game.
[506:41.65]Like, top two.
[506:42.73]Top one.
[506:44.12]Top one ever.
[507:20.53]Welcome to Mach- watching Machwojo.com!
[507:24.13]And today we're gonna show you the top one cameras in fucking PlayStation 2 history!
[507:31.93]Here it is!
[507:35.13]Why don't I just stay up here?
[507:39.41]What's the point of going down there?
[507:40.51]Just kill everything up here until this shit spawns.
[507:46.11]There's no health up here though.
[508:12.28]Break this motherfucking shield.
[508:13.72]I need health, man.
[508:33.67]No, don't swing.
[508:34.71]Don't swing.
[508:35.13]Only swing when I don't want you to.
[508:48.29]I need health though.
[508:49.39]I need health.
[508:49.81]I need health.
[508:50.17]There's a meteor!
[508:54.87]Okay, where's... I need health.
[509:04.82]Where's the troll?
[509:16.04]I need health.
[509:16.62]I need health so bad.
[509:18.50]I have to go down for the health.
[509:19.78]There's health down here somewhere.
[509:21.29]Come on, Legolas, down here!
[509:23.90]Is there health down here?
[515:30.56]Why is he already almost dead?
[515:41.39]Who's left?
[515:43.79]Who the fuck is... What is going on over here?
[515:45.93]Really getting in your hours this week, huh?
[515:53.56]I never thought I'd be doing this right now.
[515:55.98]But, like, just out of principle, I want to beat this game.
[516:12.42]Stay up here.
[516:12.94]Stay up here and fucking... Let the screen shake.
[516:17.72]By the way, can I just say that screen shake is the shittiest thing that anyone has ever put in a game?
[516:23.94]Why do you don't put... Why do you put it even... Why is it in any game?
[516:33.71]At what point do you say, hey, like, this game's kind of fun.
[516:36.27]Maybe we should shake the person's screen.
[516:41.34]Like, nobody, everyone turns it off if it's available to turn off.
[516:45.73]Has anyone figured that out yet in the gaming industry?
[516:52.33]I turned off, uh, Katana 0's green shake because it's 0%.
[517:05.19]Same with motion blur.
[517:07.47]I just don't get it.
[517:08.69]Is it to hide the fact that your game sucks?
[517:12.07]Is that why people do a shitload of motion blur and stuff?
[517:24.62]Yes!
[517:24.96]Because you don't want to see the trees popping in when they turn around too quickly?
[517:50.90]Are the archers here yet?
[517:52.38]I need health.
[517:53.24]Oh my fucking god.
[517:57.68]I need health.
[518:01.18]Alright, I got some.
[518:06.34]This music's making me go insane.
[518:07.64]Imagine being the guy driving the car.
[518:24.21]Imagine having to drive for this road trip.
[518:30.64]You guys have been able to eat snacks.
[518:33.40]I've got my hands on the wheel and my eyes blurry.
[518:37.10]You guys have been able to eat some snacks.
[518:54.68]How can we not kill this guy?
[518:58.12]I'm not going down.
[518:58.80]Archers are coming up.
[519:16.02]And they don't swing.
[519:29.84]Why is this game so hard?
[519:32.32]Because up until 2004, people were just putting random code into the engine.
[519:40.46]And going, oh shit, I guess that works.
[519:43.80]Oh my god, don't die!
[519:45.02]Don't die, don't die.
[519:47.66]Legolas, you have to fucking kill everybody here.
[519:51.75]Based in Legolasville.
[519:56.63]That's not even a fucking device that I...
[520:01.32]That's not even a box I can open!
[520:02.62]Fucking Jesus Christ!
[520:10.09]Somebody help me!
[520:11.21]Okay.
[520:11.99]Go back up the stairs.
[520:12.71]I thought I could open that box!
[520:44.19]Let's go all the way to the left.
[520:51.42]Oh my fucking god.
[520:53.58]Get this motherfucker out of my way.
[520:58.42]NPC just standing in front of me.
[521:23.84]I don't even know where I am.
[521:25.47]I'm just holding down square.
[521:27.09]I'm just spam-
[521:55.15]All the fucking archers dead.
[521:56.91]In my favorite segment!
[522:00.77]I have to go down here and get health.
[522:04.94]There's no health!
[522:06.52]Oh, oh no.
[522:07.52]This is bad.
[522:08.18]It's over.
[522:09.26]There's no health down here.
[522:13.16]It's fucking over there.
[522:26.21]Holy shit.
[522:34.49]Why don't you look?
[522:35.67]You can't look.
[522:37.17]I can't move the camera.
[522:39.55]It's a Resident Evil camera.
[522:41.67]It goes wherever the fuck it wants.
[522:44.14]It's a Resident Evil 4 tank camera.
[522:47.98]Three, two, one!
[523:14.32]You gotta call it.
[523:15.10]This shit is... fucking unbearable.
[523:20.44]I can't even... Nobody can play this.
[523:23.94]People play this.
[523:26.18]Wasn't there a dev here earlier?
[523:28.35]Did he beat this?
[523:42.26]I wonder.
[523:44.36]I wonder.
[523:49.31]That's 80% odds that the dev was fake.
[523:55.35]I gotta put on my own music.
[523:57.83]I'm done with the Lord of the Rings music.
[524:00.04]I'm putting on my own music.
[524:02.62]My own damn music.
[524:03.58]So we don't have to hear the same
[524:13.75]I'm so sick of fucking hearing it.
[524:33.41]You have to beat it already, then.
[524:37.73]Put on my fucking music.
[524:49.96]Unbelievable.
[524:51.40]Bullshit.
[524:59.06]That was ten and a half hours ago.
[525:07.21]What am I gonna put on for music?
[525:08.31]I don't know.
[525:11.07]What do we put on?
[525:21.02]No, no, no, it's gotta be something relaxing.
[525:23.38]It's gotta be chill music.
[525:28.56]Like, something like the Wii menu music or something.
[525:32.27]Anything.
[526:27.38]this doesn't really fit with the theme of what's happening
[526:58.06]I can't.
[526:58.86]I can't.
[526:59.80]I'm out of steam.
[527:01.44]I'm out of gas.
[527:03.04]There's no more gas in the tank.
[527:05.29]There's no more gas in the tank.
[527:07.05]It's IFT.
[527:07.91]I'm fucking pushing it in neutral.
[527:09.93]There's no hills left.
[527:11.65]I can push this down.
[527:40.51]Gate's doing okay.
[527:42.61]I guess.
[528:17.70]Go back to the first game.
[528:19.04]It's too late now.
[528:20.40]It's too late now.
[528:21.58]I'm coming, Legolas.
[528:48.08]I'll be there soon.
[528:48.98]It's alright.
[528:50.50]It's alright.
[529:18.08]What's that?
[529:19.04]It's alright.
[529:29.29]Just hanging out.
[529:37.39]After you help Legolas go back down to the gate.
[529:39.07]I don't... I... I... No.
[529:41.64]The gate gets hammered if you go down there.
[529:45.24]It gets crushed.
[529:47.64]I have to stay up here.
[529:48.62]Until the archers.
[529:50.51]And then... Well, no, no, no.
[529:52.17]You talk about the... Yeah, I know what you mean now.
[529:55.19]Not like the archer that I'm playing with.
[529:56.77]The archers that are on the walls.
[529:58.77]I know what you mean.
[530:06.21]Okay.
[530:15.19]Hold on I feel like my hands are getting stuck
[530:42.58]Like I was underneath my desk.
[530:44.74]Worst part is if you miss that instant kill, you just put your sword in the ground.
[531:16.24]Where are you going?
[531:16.82]Archers!
[531:17.02]Not yet?
[531:17.46]No, not yet.
[531:43.29]I just don't want to get fucking caught in here.
[531:45.03]It's just... Garrett, you're just dead.
[531:47.17]If you keep fighting more than three people, you're just dead.
[531:50.51]The system's in place.
[531:54.24]You know what I'm saying?
[531:55.22]I need health.
[532:06.13]How many fucking people have to die here?
[532:07.69]Until this ship can... I need a health pack.
[532:13.34]There's nothing down here.
[532:21.26]I need to get health.
[532:22.10]It's going to be a disaster.
[532:23.02]Is there health over here?
[532:26.20]Not over here.
[532:27.54]Okay, got it.
[532:28.72]Archers?
[532:29.10]Not yet.
[532:45.96]Archers, hurry up and get here so I can fuckin' beat this shit!
[533:20.03]Didn't even break the shield.
[533:21.73]Fuck the shield enemies.
[533:24.35]Like, fuck these guys.
[533:27.90]There's two fierce swings.
[533:29.28]They couldn't even break the damn thing.
[533:31.06]Fuck you.
[533:33.56]Save these for the archers.
[533:38.21]Why are there no archers?
[533:39.89]It didn't take this long the last time.
[533:41.97]Up here.
[533:57.78]They are?
[533:58.14]Okay, let's go.
[534:02.66]Wait, they're not here.
[534:03.26]Yes, they are.
[534:16.40]Oh my god.
[534:17.32]It's so painful.
[534:21.50]Okay, I did it.
[534:25.33]I did it.
[534:25.69]I did it.
[534:28.47]Now?
[534:29.07]I need health too though.
[534:32.05]Okay, so there's two berserkers down there that have to die.
[534:37.64]There's two berserkers down here that have to die.
[534:42.06]Right now.
[535:01.92]Of course they're both attacking me at the same fucking goddamn time.
[535:04.38]I don't even know what's hitting me.
[535:12.08]What did he do?
[535:12.61]What the fuck?
[535:14.29]What?
[535:14.67]Did he grab me?
[535:17.39]What the fuck is happening?
[535:33.68]Alright.
[535:34.00]Where's the trolls?
[535:34.52]Where are the trolls?
[535:35.68]Bring them in.
[535:36.08]Bring in the trolls now.
[535:36.94]I got full health.
[535:38.35]Wait, this is another berserker here.
[535:59.22]I can't even stop!
[535:59.70]Stab him!
[536:00.01]He's on the ground!
[536:00.41]He's dead!
[536:08.99]Here they come! Here they come! Here they come come come! Here they come! Here they come! Here they come come come!
[536:18.75]Just kill the trolls? Easy. Easy. Let's go. Easy.
[536:43.46]I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it!
[536:59.68]Did I do it?
[537:00.40]What?
[537:03.33]Is there another part to this?
[537:10.09]I don't know.
[537:21.46]Yes, I don't have to do it anymore.
[537:23.38]Oh man, it's over.
[537:24.10]It's over.
[537:25.90]It's over.
[537:50.23]It's over.
[537:51.63]Sauron and Saruman are dead.
[537:53.98]Let's take a look and see what I look like.
[537:57.32]How do I look?
[538:17.21]The hands of a hobbit each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
[538:45.99]Is this the shmeagle music?
[538:53.83]You look hungry.
[538:55.75]I am hungry.
[539:10.28]The fucking golem music had to play the second I turned the camera on.
[539:13.42]Give me a break.
[539:31.74]I don't know what I even... Nice mic noises.
[539:34.26]I know, I'm sorry.
[539:39.79]Okay, so, um... Wait, is that not the end of the game?
[539:51.10]How is that not the end of the game?
[540:01.07]I don't think I want anything else.
[540:07.78]I guess I'll get this.
[540:13.00]I told you I was going to do it.
[540:15.56]I told you I was going to get past the first part of Fellowship of the Ring.
[540:19.37]That's right, fake Grumbo.
[540:22.69]I told you I was going to do it.
[540:44.27]I want my two dollars from you, fake rumble.
[540:49.09]Although I made that part up.
[540:50.58]You don't have to give me any money.
[541:05.15]Vigo, you didn't get to fucking helm, Steve.
[541:07.04]Give me a break.
[541:24.36]If you got to Helm's Deep, you'd probably be like, I refuse the interview.
[541:26.94]You sound so tired.
[541:45.16]I'm glad I did it.
[541:46.30]What I've seen of the video game seems to reflect the fact that the second movie, as opposed to the first one, is on a bigger scale.
[541:54.23]And I'm looking forward to seeing them just as I am to seeing the rest of this game.
[541:58.03]I've only seen a sample today.
[542:02.79]He falls down.
[542:03.21]I love it when he falls down.
[542:04.07]That's true.
[542:04.85]That's true.
[542:05.37]I like it when he falls down.
[542:31.98]Somebody said he hates it?
[542:33.30]Do you remember when Viggo Mortensen hates the game?
[542:36.46]Was that... Wait, was that sarcastic?
[542:40.23]Well, you know, I really love it when he falls down and like has to change and gets the shit kicked out of him.
[542:54.97]I didn't like being a lot slower than... I can't believe it was slower.
[542:59.17]I can't believe he was slower.
[543:02.57]I did that level like 20 times in a row and I didn't know that he was like 15% slower.
[543:09.62]It took me actually like two or three solid tries.
[543:12.50]You don't have to do so much darn hard work as you do when you're originally creating the character.
[543:19.99]shooting a film is necessarily very slow wait wait wait go back how do we go back how do we go back how do we pause how do we that was that was that was a that was a grip look at that grip he put his right hand over I think to grab them you fear to go into those minds that was a sick claw gamer grip what they awoke in the darkness
[543:47.85]I really enjoyed making the game because you don't have to do so much darn hard work to do when you're originally creating the character.
[543:55.03]I don't necessarily have to do that.
[543:57.31]That's the left hand.
[544:04.62]When you do the game, you stand in the studio.
[544:07.04]And you say, well, I think you ought to say this and this and this.
[544:09.99]He's awesome, by the way.
[544:11.41]He is phenomenal.
[544:13.57]Ambush!
[544:14.59]Ambush!
[544:15.57]And then they take all that, and they incorporate it into the games, and you get some of the credit.
[544:21.27]Those explosive devices must be destroyed.
[544:24.07]He's getting into it.
[544:24.61]I love this model of me as Gimli.
[544:25.85]I mean, he's such a vigorous, virile, attractive character.
[544:30.51]He's really the only person you want to play.
[544:32.12]I mean, the rest, you know, the Aragorns, you know, the Legolas, you know, handsome, good-looking guys and all that stuff.
[544:38.16]But for real quality warfare, you have to go for a Gimli.
[544:45.03]We spent 14 months in the most beautiful locations in the world in New Zealand to get the right look for the film.
[544:51.44]The game is a wartime combat situation.
[544:55.64]So you betrayed him.
[544:57.50]I didn't betray him.
[544:58.84]I can't leave him there.
[545:01.19]They made it impossible to beat the ladder level with him.
[545:05.35]That's not my fault.
[545:06.51]It's a new addiction that I have discovered.
[545:10.67]So, Gamesters...
[545:12.29]Well done.
[545:13.11]Congratulations on getting into this little niche that gives you the interview.
[545:17.15]I wish I could tell you how to play the game better, but in fact, I could never get to this level.
[545:21.19]Good luck with this and carry on playing.
[545:24.69]Oh, he's so wonderful.
[545:28.59]I could just listen to him talk all day.
[545:34.82]He's just, he's phenomenal.
[545:39.54]Do we have any more?
[545:41.94]Oh, no.
[545:44.93]Oh, I need level 10 with Aragorn and we get the super secret video.
[545:50.89]What's down here?
[545:58.04]What level?
[545:58.42]How close am I now?
[546:00.66]I can't.
[546:02.64]I can't replay anything.
[546:05.83]I didn't get to level 10.
[546:11.15]Wait, whoa, whoa!
[546:12.39]Since when can I do that?
[546:13.93]Since when can I do that?
[546:16.27]Oh, because I beat the game.
[546:17.58]Now I can do it.
[546:18.42]I beat the game.
[546:18.92]I see.
[546:19.18]I don't want to see that ever again.
[546:25.86]Alright, for all the shit that I was talking about the game...
[546:41.91]You do have to give some credit here.
[546:44.99]This shit was 20 years ago.
[546:48.63]This is pretty damn cool for 20 years ago.
[546:51.15]Except for these three levels.
[546:52.13]Delete them.
[546:55.46]And this one.
[546:58.84]And this one.
[547:05.38]2001.
[547:08.61]If I remember correctly, Return of the King...
[547:11.49]is a much more polished, better video game.
[547:19.96]I didn't like this one.
[547:21.50]Uh, this one was, this one was good.
[547:22.82]I didn't, okay, let's go, let me, let me reassess here.
[547:26.58]Cool.
[547:27.92]That was cool, fighting the ringwraiths, yeah.
[547:31.31]We had to get, no, this is when they were breaking through the ice and stuff, that's cool.
[547:34.99]This is the big, uh, the big troll with the, yeah, that's cool.
[547:39.29]Um, eh, I didn't like this one.
[547:42.69]This one was good where you have to walk around the forest and then you sneak around.
[547:46.75]This one was cool.
[547:48.27]No, don't like it.
[547:50.67]This is not even a level.
[547:55.11]This was just a door and then a boss.
[547:57.90]So, I mean, it was okay.
[547:59.56]Delete.
[548:00.82]Good.
[548:01.06]Sorry for how, like, horrendous this was.
[548:06.82]It was still hysterical.
[548:09.60]Like, do you remember our first four or five attempts in this level?
[548:13.24]Just how much fun we were having.
[548:14.70]We were having so much fun in the first five or six attempts.
[548:22.29]It was... Then an hour and a half went by.
[548:30.09]Then I lost all the feeling in my tongue.
[548:32.93]It's back now.
[548:39.12]12 and a half hours, okay.
[548:47.53]I want that 10, I want that level 10 video.
[548:49.05]Remember when he aspirated jerky?
[549:01.38]Damn, it really has been a whole day.
[549:04.12]How close was I to 10?
[549:13.76]Okay.
[549:15.00]Have I actually gone crazy?
[549:17.94]YouTube.com.
[549:19.32]Aragorn level 10 video.
[549:32.17]It doesn't exist on YouTube.
[549:48.66]It doesn't exist on YouTube.
[549:56.68]I want that fucking video.
[549:58.14]I want to see Viggo Mortensen talk about how much he loves the game again.
[550:01.17]Look, this is going to be simple.
[550:02.03]I'm like max level and shit.
[550:03.75]I'm right there.
[550:07.01]Oh yeah, I'm right there.
[550:08.71]Let's go.
[550:19.32]What's the longest stream I've ever done?
[550:23.74]What is actually the longest stream I've ever done?
[550:26.62]Does anybody know?
[550:28.84]It's now this one.
[550:31.77]Is it actually this one now?
[550:51.97]It's up 10.
[550:52.82]There it is.
[550:54.42]We get the secret video.
[551:04.29]Lifeline was pretty long.
[551:05.15]I think it was like 11 and a half, though.
[551:31.53]Wait, can I actually hit him?
[551:34.43]Um, no.
[551:35.39]Don't kill me.
[551:46.47]Don't kill me.
[551:47.01]He's gonna be mad?
[551:49.11]What do you mean, mad?
[552:01.23]Well, actually, I am a little bit mad.
[552:04.29]Nothing to do with the video game, really.
[552:06.19]It has to do with... I've been... I've been streaming on Twitch for... What?
[552:12.59]Four?
[552:13.05]Just five years?
[552:14.51]Six years?
[552:15.19]Like, just almost a full five years, right?
[552:21.05]And the longest stream I've ever done is going to be, for a long time, Lord of the Rings The Two Towers on PlayStation 2.
[552:29.22]I think that's more upsetting.
[552:42.15]And the first Hobbit game.
[552:43.35]Yeah, but that's not why this was so long.
[552:55.47]Longest and worst stream.
[552:58.06]I don't agree with that at all.
[552:59.98]No, no, no, not even close.
[553:01.76]I don't agree with that at all.
[553:06.10]I had a fucking lot of fun on this stream.
[553:09.30]I thought this was a lot of fun.
[553:16.94]Yesterday's stream was the worst stream.
[553:19.34]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[553:20.24]Yeah, because this was streamed yesterday.
[553:22.62]Oh.
[553:26.12]This was... I had a lot of fun on this stream.
[553:37.13]Alright.
[553:37.79]Level 10.
[553:38.41]Secret video.
[553:39.45]Let's go.
[553:54.04]The CCTV joke was worth 10 hours of setup.
[553:59.45]What's the final thing I'm gonna buy, though?
[554:04.01]Probably this thing.
[554:16.26]And... this one.
[554:21.68]Here we go.
[554:23.00]Alright, Viggo.
[554:25.94]Tell me your secret- Send me your secrets, Viggo.
[554:45.67]Aragorn.
[554:46.89]Unplayed.
[554:49.15]Let's play the video then!
[554:52.28]It's about to be played!
[554:53.44]What?
[555:04.91]Floor 1 out of 20.
[555:47.95]I'm not doing that.
[555:51.85]We're not doing that.
[555:52.53]I'm sorry.
[555:53.99]No, no fucking way.
[555:55.53]Alright, I want to watch this.
[556:01.24]Trending now on CNN.
[556:08.96]This was probably somebody's first experience with Lord of the Rings.
[556:16.12]Yeah, we talked about that earlier.
[556:25.41]Oops.
[556:31.26]This was somebody's first stream.
[556:34.84]Yeah, it was probably a lot of people's first streams.
[556:37.90]Probably.
[556:39.30]Where's the music?
[556:41.07]I don't want any sounds right now.
[556:42.99]I don't want any stimulation.
[556:46.19]I just want to sit here.
[556:48.14]No stimulation at all.
[556:52.87]Except for this.
[556:56.05]No stimulation.
[556:57.51]Just quiet.
[557:03.07]This is the only thing I want in my life right now.
[557:07.83]The battle!
[557:08.27]The battle for health!
[557:11.95]The battle for Home Depot!
[557:17.01]Roger, people on social media are calling this the Battle of Home Depot.
[557:25.06]This reporter cannot understand just how ridiculous this is, seeing this from above.
[557:31.22]You don't see the other 300 people that are back behind the doors.
[557:42.44]Holy shit, Legolas is dead.
[557:52.17]This is a mess.
[558:03.37]Hello?
[558:04.09]Wait, why is this not working?
[558:05.73]Here we go.
[558:12.77]Is this a... Hello?
[558:15.53]Oh, whoops.
[558:19.89]yeah guys um so this is uh this is what happens this is uh this is what happens when you uh yeah it's been it's been a long night so we're just gonna we're just gonna chill for a little bit you know just hang out
[558:50.87]I, uh, I might sound a little different, but that's because, uh, you know, I've been yelling a lot tonight, so I've been making a lot of noise.
[559:03.23]Um, uh, I inhaled a piece of jerky, and that's kind of why I feel like this.
[559:12.46]Uh, so for the bits, what, let's turn this off so I don't sound like a fucking weirdo.
[559:19.91]Todd Howard?
[559:21.11]Todd Howard?
[559:27.06]And next, coming up, we have... Our first mobile game experience.
[559:40.85]I can't.
[559:41.49]I have to go to bed.
[559:45.46]If you thought for one second that we were not gonna go completely crazy here with Elder Scrolls Blades, that's the one.
[559:56.98]Welcome to FalloutCon.
[560:11.57]You can do some really weird shit with this thing, man.
[560:14.21]I'll tell you.
[560:15.71]Like, for instance, what if I do this?
[560:18.35]Ready?
[560:19.03]Like, what if I go like this?
[560:21.97]And then go like this.
[560:23.21]Okay.
[560:24.89]So right now, how does this sound now?
[560:26.85]This probably sounds really weird.
[560:29.13]Like, very strange.
[560:30.14]Oh.
[560:33.40]This is...
[560:35.22]This is one hour after two towers.
[560:37.86]This is two hours after two towers.
[560:41.84]This is four hours after two towers.
[560:45.83]This is six hours after two towers.
[560:50.23]This is ten hours after two towers.
[561:52.00]I sound weird now.
[561:52.94]Why do I sound so strange to myself?
[561:54.88]I sound weird to myself.
[561:57.39]Anybody else sound weird to yourself?
[561:58.79]Okay.
[562:00.13]Um, I am going to have to forgo the bits tonight, guys.
[562:02.65]I'm really sorry.
[562:03.77]I feel like somebody just punched me in the face with a car.
[562:07.60]Uh, we have like 12 hours, 13 hours of bits.
[562:10.44]It's going to take me like two or three hours to go through it.
[562:13.62]Um, this is the second time we've moved bits to another day.
[562:17.41]I'm really sorry about that, but, um, it's like I got run over by a car.
[562:26.22]There was a shitload of money and a shitload of people supported the channel.
[562:29.60]You guys are fucking incredible.
[562:31.42]I can at least run the credits.
[562:34.28]Do them next time.
[562:35.38]Yeah, by the way, I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[562:39.24]This was like a mega stream.
[562:41.76]So what's going to happen is you'll probably see me again on Wednesday.
[562:46.12]I'm going to take a day or two here.
[562:47.86]You'll see me on the 15th.
[562:49.10]Wednesday the 15th.
[562:51.40]This is an Omega LOL stream.
[562:59.33]You ready for me to fix that once and for all?
[563:02.87]It's because the heater turns on behind me.
[563:05.73]I just figured it out.
[563:08.35]Yep.
[563:12.94]That's the heater, and the gate is not high enough to mask the heater.
[563:17.84]Figured it out.
[563:20.32]Let me fix that right now.
[563:34.65]There it is.
[563:41.32]Got it.
[563:43.28]That fixed it, right?
[563:50.78]Okay.
[563:51.84]Good.
[563:52.54]Oh, wow.
[563:53.06]I'm so sorry that that's been happening.
[563:56.17]I'm so sorry about that.
[563:57.47]I'm so sorry.
[563:59.59]I'm so sorry.
[564:00.27]Okay, that sounds weird.
[564:01.25]There's one more thing I want to do before I go.
[564:06.24]Let me look at this.
[564:08.92]There's some weird shit here.

[568:56.68]I hate that game.
[568:58.80]Why?
[568:59.04]Well, this is a wild one.
[569:05.86]Didn't plan on it.

[569:48.56]Hey.
[569:49.52]Hey.
[569:52.83]The compressor's back on.
[569:54.49]Oh, now I know what you guys are talking about when you say this sounds fucking terrible.
[569:59.99]I really thought everyone was just gaslighting me, telling me that I was crazy.
[570:03.32]This fucking sounds terrible.
[570:05.28]This sounds awful.
[570:06.96]See, now it sounds a lot better.
[570:09.18]That sounds way better.
[570:10.04]That sounds a thousand times better.
[570:14.19]Holy shit, I didn't believe you.
[570:15.89]I really didn't.
[570:17.25]I didn't believe a single word anybody was saying.
[570:23.40]Because this is what it sounded like before.
[570:27.63]Maybe I need to be closer to the mic.
[570:29.95]It's just my room is so noisy.
[570:31.23]That's the problem.
[570:31.85]Oh, hey guys.
[570:37.66]It's the podcast voice.
[570:40.80]Good afternoon.
[570:43.00]Hope everybody's having a great day today.
[570:49.78]The following has encouragement.
[570:52.58]That's what it is.
[570:53.20]It's a bunch of compress- The following has encouragement and love.
[571:02.61]We want to thank you for being here.

[571:14.71]Well, tell him!
[571:16.74]A great job!
[571:20.80]You're the one that gets things done and wrapped.
[571:22.72]That's what he did.
[571:23.60]Holy shit.
[571:24.60]I love that guy.
[571:25.74]Okay, let's go back to normal.
[571:27.79]Hold on.
[571:28.23]What if I do this?
[571:29.21]Well, I think I fixed it.
[571:30.07]Did I fix it even more?
[571:31.53]I think I just fixed it even more.
[571:34.11]I think I just fixed it even more.
[571:35.71]Did I?
[571:36.41]Hey, how you guys doing?
[571:37.95]Is it fixed?
[571:39.03]Fixed even more?
[571:39.65]Are we fixed even more?
[571:41.96]How are we?
[571:43.44]No, it's worse now.
[571:44.38]How about now?
[571:45.60]How about this?
[571:47.48]Is it a little bit better from here?
[571:51.25]sounds exactly the same.
[571:54.49]Now it sounds horrible.
[571:59.37]What if I do this?
[572:03.58]Okay, I just did this.
[572:06.26]Alright, maybe now.
[572:08.30]How's that?
[572:09.52]Is that a little bit better?
[572:10.26]Does this change anything?
[572:16.55]Does it make it sound better?
[572:19.73]Or no?
[572:20.35]Still just as bad?
[572:21.51]Go back?
[572:22.17]Okay.
[572:24.23]I'm still trying to get it to sound okay, you know?
[572:27.59]Go back to podcast voice.
[572:30.30]I really don't think you want me to go back to podcast voice.
[572:35.34]Hold on, what about this?
[572:38.72]Okay, listen to how weird this sounds.
[572:41.85]So this is 100 compressor and 100 de-esser.
[572:47.08]This is like... It just sounds so strange.
[572:49.96]Don't I sound so weird?
[572:52.70]I sound like a different person.
[572:53.68]Alright.

[574:47.41]I mean, you know what I mean?
[574:49.05]You could, but that's a lot of people to dump on somebody.
