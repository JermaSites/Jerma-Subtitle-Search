[00:04.92]Late.
[00:06.20]No, no, no.
[00:09.58]I'm not late.
[00:12.20]I'm contractually obligated to be here!
[00:14.62]Holy shit, that sounded weird.
[00:16.46]That was like... I don't know with that, I don't know.
[00:28.72]My like throat just took that and blended it up into a bunch of liquid.
[00:36.25]I don't know what that was.
[00:37.13]I'm sorry.
[00:38.47]Anyways, hi.
[00:43.27]Got a lot of stuff going on this weekend.
[00:48.41]I'm not supposed to be here right now.
[00:51.35]Usually the intro screen is there for 2-3 minutes.
[00:56.03]I was just ready.
[01:01.19]Yeah, we're gonna be live for three days in a row.
[01:04.17]We got today, tomorrow and Saturday.
[01:08.75]Lots of games to play.
[01:10.53]Including.
[01:10.95]Of course.
[01:14.37]Gotham Knights.
[01:16.25]Sponsored to play Gotham Knights.
[01:19.91]Now this is an Omega sponsor.
[01:21.51]Because it's three days in a row.
[01:23.95]But.
[01:25.37]But.
[01:29.73]Gotham Knights is only going to be for a couple hours a day.
[01:34.85]And.
[01:35.27]I'm going to be here for at least.
[01:36.99]Five to seven hours each day.
[01:39.62]We got a lot of shit to play.
[01:45.60]Omega Gaming Weekend.
[01:46.76]We want SCORN.
[01:47.72]I beat SCORN.
[01:49.30]I literally beat SCORN three days ago.
[01:51.80]Do it again.
[02:00.91]There's not even a second ending.
[02:02.85]By the way, okay.
[02:04.69]Let me tell you about SCORN.
[02:07.20]I sat down and after an evening and after sleeping on it, I kind of realized how much I liked that game.
[02:16.65]I really liked it.
[02:18.47]It was, I don't know, it stuck with me for a little while.
[02:20.69]It was just like, whoa, that game was weird.
[02:26.69]It stuck with me for a little while.
[02:27.71]It did.
[02:34.50]Play the sound.
[02:35.20]I actually still have it.
[02:40.26]It's still saved here.
[02:41.26]That's so stupid.
[02:48.03]But yeah, so you probably saw the title.
[02:50.29]We're playing Crash Bandicoot 4.
[02:52.07]It's about time.
[02:55.91]I have, well, the title already says it.
[02:58.49]I've never played Crash Bandicoot.
[03:00.85]I don't have, I probably have like maybe 40 minutes total across the whole franchise, across various demo discs.
[03:09.39]So we're starting with, in the middle of the Star Wars franchise.
[03:13.23]Have you played it?
[03:21.83]Have you played Uncharted?
[03:24.35]No.
[03:26.91]No.
[03:28.81]I've never played Uncharted.
[03:30.71]I don't even know what that... Honestly, I don't even know what that game is.
[03:36.20]I know that Uncharted is about a guy that runs around getting treasure, and then sometimes when something bad happens, he goes, Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[03:45.47]Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[03:47.67]That's it.
[03:47.93]I don't know anything about... I don't have nothing... I don't know anything else.
[03:55.69]Should I play Uncharted?
[03:56.97]Should I just do it?
[04:02.27]Is it fun?
[04:02.85]Is it a good game?
[04:07.67]Is the Uncharted series a good franchise?
[04:10.15]And do a poll.
[04:10.87]I want it to be at least... If it's not 80%, at least I won't play it.
[04:18.22]Is Uncharted a great franchise?
[04:26.03]I don't want to see a pull.
[04:30.05]And if it's over 80%, I'll play it.
[04:40.64]Okay.
[04:41.98]And I didn't say good.
[04:42.66]I say great.
[04:44.98]Great franchise.
[04:46.36]Okay.
[04:52.98]Whoa.
[04:55.54]Oh, no.
[04:56.64]This is not what I expected.
[04:57.68]I thought everybody loved this franchise.
[05:01.30]Really?
[05:02.06]That seems pretty high.
[05:02.98]40... 50%?
[05:10.29]What?
[05:11.89]The later games are much more enjoyable.
[05:19.84]Hmm.
[05:25.21]It's good, but it's not great.
[05:28.39]Are we going under 50% here for is it a great franchise?
[05:31.37]Huh.
[05:39.77]Okay.
[05:41.11]Well, I guess maybe I'll pass on it.
[05:44.11]Maybe one day I'll play it for fun.
[05:45.59]Alright, let's get started.
[05:48.83]Let's go.
[05:49.17]We're playing.
[05:50.15]We got like six or seven games to play this weekend.
[05:57.00]And of course, Gotham Knights.
[06:00.20]But that's not right now.
[06:01.80]We'll do that later.
[06:02.32]The way that this is going to be sectioned off is for like the first two or three hours, maybe first few hours.
[06:10.52]We'll play some stuff.
[06:11.94]And the stream will always end with Gotham Knights.
[06:15.30]That'll be like the second half of each stream.
[06:20.26]I'm ready to play Crash Bandicoot.
[06:21.24]Am I going to like this game?
[06:22.53]How do you even play Crash Bandicoot?
[06:25.40]Is this like an RTS or something?
[06:26.54]Imagine if he thought that.
[06:42.45]You jump and run.
[06:43.77]Okay, this is kind of loud.
[06:44.67]Is this loud for me?
[06:49.60]It's a little better.
[06:51.78]Alright.
[06:52.36]Crash Bandicoot 4.
[06:53.70]It's about time.
[06:56.75]Oh, cutscene!
[07:01.73]You look like 20 today.
[07:02.96]24?
[07:03.40]Let's go shave.
[07:05.76]Quiet!
[07:07.46]Crash Bandicoot.
[07:09.74]At last, I, the great Neo Cortex, have you right where I want you.
[07:16.89]And now, the final blow!
[07:21.73]Is Jimmy Neutron this guy's origin story?
[07:24.37]Is it what he turned into?
[07:31.26]Face it, Entropy.
[07:32.74]It's going to fail.
[07:34.42]Again.
[07:36.18]At least Uka Uka and I attempt to free us from this prison.
[07:40.51]I won't sit idly by and listen to your inane ramblings for another decade.
[07:57.82]Whoa.
[08:02.78]Is he dead?
[08:07.75]Leave him.
[08:08.61]He served his purpose.
[08:12.03]I guess design is crazy, but all clocks.
[08:23.53]I feel like I should, I'm not allowed to play this game.
[08:25.67]Like I have to put my save file from the first three games, otherwise I'm not a real fan.
[08:55.14]Alright, how do I play?
[09:00.62]Fluid.
[09:01.36]It's fluid!
[09:05.16]I gotta warn you, I'm in a fucked up mood today.
[09:06.90]I just am.
[09:09.06]I'm in a fucked up mood.
[09:11.33]I gotta get this out before the sponsor portion.
[09:14.05]If I gotta get this out, it'd be before the sponsor portion, you know what I'm saying?
[09:18.03]Okay, cool.
[09:20.35]Dude, can I play the first three games on this?
[09:31.65]Dude, to get apples, right?
[09:32.47]Is there a double jump?
[09:39.11]There is, alright.
[09:44.45]Ooh, Joe HUD.
[09:47.03]Okay.
[09:47.95]Is this a remake?
[09:51.12]Or is this a brand new experience?
[09:59.45]New game.
[09:59.87]Original game.
[10:00.35]Alright.
[10:03.41]This is kind of fun.
[10:07.01]I remember this style of level being in the demo disk.
[10:17.26]Crash!
[10:18.30]Quickly!
[10:18.84]We must go!
[10:26.26]They actually have a good shadow in this one.
[10:29.90]They are pretty clean looking, you're right.
[10:35.36]Okay, shield.
[10:36.21]Okay, so that shields me from damage.
[10:38.05]Oh, you can take one hit, right?
[10:39.45]You die in one hit in this game?
[10:44.43]Oh my god.
[10:46.55]Wait, can I... What's the parry?
[10:49.56]Oh.
[10:55.80]I'm biting my whole mouth off.
[10:57.08]I don't know why I do this.
[11:02.86]So just run?
[11:05.85]Uh, what happened?
[11:06.75]Oh, that was TNT.
[11:07.31]Alright, so that's Crash Bandicoot 4.
[11:10.03]That was fun.
[11:11.13]Um, it's pretty good.
[11:13.09]I'd say you should give it a try if you, um, if you like it.
[11:23.05]Are they bosses?
[11:32.60]Will it blow up?
[11:40.71]Alright, I get it.
[11:41.31]Didn't they make like five racing games?
[11:52.61]Yeah, I'm not playing on the retro mode.
[11:54.46]I'm playing on the modern mode.
[11:55.66]Is that bad?
[12:00.82]Oh, shit.
[12:14.69]Displode.
[12:20.77]Checkpoint.
[12:21.30]Cool.
[12:22.82]Did you have two shields?
[12:27.16]No, I'm not.
[12:27.85]Why would I play this SCORN sound effect right now?
[12:44.47]Ooh, alright.
[12:46.51]I feel like this is a fun game to speedrun.
[12:52.45]Are you okay?
[12:53.09]Yeah.
[12:54.51]Why are you asking that?
[12:57.65]Bonus round?
[13:03.88]Nice.
[13:07.62]Oh!
[13:08.50]Wait, can I still get it?
[13:09.64]Okay.
[13:17.11]So how does this compare to the other ones?
[13:18.23]Do you guys think it looks good?
[13:24.86]How come you're not laughing hysterically at all the cartoon sound effects?
[13:34.27]Why would I... What?
[13:43.66]Holy shit.
[13:46.67]Holy shit.
[13:59.84]That's the only time I'm doing that for the whole night, I promise.
[14:12.94]Okay, I will tell you, I cannot do that during Gotham Knights.
[14:17.70]Like, I can't.
[14:19.40]I literally can't.
[14:20.62]Like, I cannot look up at Gotham City, like the big sprawling city, and all of a sudden you hear a score.
[14:27.45]That can't happen.
[14:28.83]I genuinely think that I can't do that.
[14:37.24]You have to.
[14:38.04]I can't do that.
[14:47.37]You better remove that from your soundboard then.
[14:49.62]Gems and skins?
[14:53.00]Gems unlock skins.
[14:53.94]Earn gems by breaking crates, getting Wumpa, finding hidden gems, and beating levels in three lives or less.
[15:00.77]Okay.
[15:04.41]Alright.
[15:06.81]That's kind of cool, I guess.
[15:17.51]Is it just in-game currency?
[15:18.35]I don't think you have to pay for anything.
[15:25.96]Golden wumpa crates give 25 wumpa.
[15:27.44]Didn't even tell me how to grab the fucking pole thing.
[15:40.17]Didn't even tell me how to do it.
[15:41.91]How do I do it?
[15:42.41]How do I hold it?
[15:51.00]Okay, you have to hold jump.
[15:52.00]Okay, they didn't say that.
[15:54.30]Where's my tutorial?
[15:55.26]I don't know why I just tried to dodge.
[15:59.57]There is a dodge roll.
[16:00.63]Okay, there is.
[16:01.17]You're too big of a streamer now.
[16:17.28]Wait, what did that person say?
[16:18.94]What did he say?
[16:22.11]I know you're a big streamer, just don't forget your roots.
[16:24.05]What do you mean?
[16:31.87]You gonna ban that guy?
[16:32.75]No.
[16:33.49]Why?
[16:41.04]You need longer hair.
[16:42.06]I'm gonna hit this, aren't I?
[16:51.67]You've changed?
[16:52.97]I don't know.
[16:54.34]Okay, I know everybody says this.
[16:57.20]I don't think I have.
[16:57.84]I feel like I have the same brain, same thought process, the same way I approach everything since I was 25?
[17:02.92]26?
[17:04.22]I feel like I haven't really done anything that different.
[17:11.43]Maybe I have.
[17:11.83]I don't know.
[17:14.17]It's hard to tell.
[17:23.36]Whoa.
[17:24.48]Alright, we're good.
[17:28.44]Where's 2018 Gerbo?
[17:35.57]Did he just kill me?
[17:36.49]Alright.
[17:39.77]What's that?
[17:40.17]Can I jump over there?
[17:41.51]I thought that was like a magical item.
[17:50.07]That looks like a secret to me.
[17:53.48]Like, grabbing that little rat thing.
[18:02.72]There's no iframes.
[18:03.98]Okay, I can't be losing in this game.
[18:05.62]I physically can't.
[18:10.69]If I die to this guy one more time, I will do a SCORN in Gotham Knights.
[18:21.02]Thank God.
[18:21.98]I physically, I think that's literally not, that's like the contract.
[18:29.38]Okay.
[18:42.67]Alright.
[18:42.99]Alright.
[18:43.21]Alright.
[18:43.45]The game got a lot harder in one tutorial level.
[18:45.89]Hold on.
[18:51.74]Cool.
[18:52.16]While holding B, double jump.
[19:08.80]Oh, it's like a Super Mario 2 Luigi jump.
[19:11.26]That's kind of cool.
[19:17.16]Oh, shit!
[19:25.87]12.
[19:25.91]Oh, that's good.
[19:32.48]12 right here, right?
[19:35.02]Nice.
[19:35.34]Alright.
[19:35.60]I got them all.
[19:37.80]100%.
[19:40.46]What game are you playing?
[19:41.32]This is Crash Bandicoot 4.
[19:56.01]Still counting from off screen.
[19:56.87]Alright, I get it.
[20:04.36]They want you to move up.
[20:13.14]Oh my god, I fucked it up.
[20:47.41]He lives into a Goo Goo Gaga game.
[20:55.34]Super Mario 1 is one of the hardest games ever.
[21:02.40]Sorry.
[21:03.86]Crash Bandicoot PS1 is one of the hardest games of that generation.
[21:14.90]Is this your fursona?
[21:18.40]I mean, no, but it's kind of cool.
[21:23.66]I don't know, is it a bandicoot?
[21:30.63]What even is a bandicoot?
[21:31.49]Cool.
[21:53.92]I haven't even made a movie with this guy.
[22:04.28]Can you see a 3D animated series?
[22:08.62]TV series?
[22:20.51]Oh, come on.
[22:21.33]Two?
[22:25.16]Two.
[22:25.80]I missed two.
[22:28.70]Can you please do the crash whoa sound?
[22:36.52]How's it go?
[22:42.86]What does it sound like?
[22:49.69]No, no, no, no, no, no way.
[22:52.33]Not in a million years.
[22:55.71]It goes, whoa!
[22:57.25]Like that?
[23:00.15]What?
[23:01.50]That's not even right.
[23:05.48]I'll try it.
[23:21.87]Ooh!
[23:22.19]That kind of sounded like Luigi.
[23:23.42]Oh, cookies.
[23:23.66]Okay.
[23:41.83]Uka-Uka unknowingly paved the way for our bright future.
[23:46.50]Once my rich generator is complete, dominion over all of time and space will be within our grasp!
[23:54.56]Engine, Embryo, you had some little projects you wanted to tell me about?
[23:59.70]Master, my mechanical Marvel will hypnotize you and I
[24:06.07]Cool.
[24:34.61]I don't know what the sound effect is.
[24:41.57]Welcome to the dimensional map.
[24:42.65]Here you can select levels to play.
[24:43.89]Switch between Crash and Coco.
[24:45.73]Change skins and replay levels to take on time trials.
[24:48.67]Time trials?
[24:49.21]Okay.
[24:55.20]Alright.
[25:00.44]Alright.
[25:03.68]This is the actual sound effect.
[25:05.16]Alright, hold on.
[25:13.57]That was not even that different than what I did.
[25:20.83]That was not even that different than the thing I just did.
[25:27.85]Try it again.
[25:33.67]I win.
[25:33.97]Alright, B level to unlock time trial.
[25:43.61]Should I try that?
[25:44.11]Hold on.
[25:47.24]Wait.
[25:48.96]Did I unlock a skin?
[25:49.78]How do I get this?
[25:54.74]Unlock in rude awakening.
[25:57.50]Oh, shit.
[26:00.94]What?
[26:01.22]They have so many skins.
[26:06.39]Digital download.
[26:07.39]Oh, look at that.
[26:11.61]Totally tubular.
[26:18.82]Should I use the... This one?
[26:26.12]Unlock an insanity peak.
[26:30.36]I mean, it's Halloween.
[26:31.08]I'm going to do...
[26:34.30]They have the same moves?
[26:35.82]Both characters have the same moves?
[26:39.84]Let's try.
[26:51.84]They're exactly the same?
[26:52.80]Okay.
[26:59.20]So, we need the other masks to close the rifts?
[27:02.10]Correct.
[27:02.95]Now, my brother Akano is around here somewhere.
[27:06.59]Welcome to the shelter, man.
[27:10.39]Your precious mask.
[27:12.99]Behold the aforementioned putts.
[27:14.74]Don't worry.
[27:15.82]We have a thing where we fight, he loses.
[27:18.24]It's a well-established dynamic.
[27:20.15]Now this time, I have a backstage pass for you to get up close and personal with my weapon of mass percussion.
[27:29.40]Come ready to ride!
[27:32.96]Let's go!
[27:37.20]Wait.
[27:44.87]Faze world?
[27:45.93]Oh.
[27:49.11]This is kind of weird.
[27:50.43]Alright.
[28:04.56]The depth is hard to do here.
[28:06.30]Hold on.
[28:10.96]I want to try to get as many boxes as I can.
[28:20.71]Shut up.
[28:25.81]Oh my fucking god.
[28:28.20]I'm never gonna beat this.
[28:29.26]Oh.
[29:07.69]Why?
[29:08.39]God, don't freak out.
[29:09.51]Like, stop.
[29:10.73]Don't, like... What's happening?
[29:13.87]I genuinely don't understand.
[29:16.80]Is that jump way larger than I think it is?
[29:20.50]I'm going to lose to the second level.
[29:27.82]Why is this jump five times bigger than I think it is?
[29:32.13]That jump is huge.
[29:33.27]Okay, that was the problem.
[29:34.31]I'm good.
[29:44.16]I like that sound.
[29:52.50]Sorcery, sorcery, sorcery!
[29:56.70]What about it?
[29:57.78]I should play it?
[29:58.24]Yeah, I will.
[30:08.96]One, two... Oh!
[30:12.46]Oh, I missed dialog.
[30:13.78]Shit.
[30:23.02]Don't kill me, please.
[30:24.90]Nitro crates explode on touch.
[30:29.15]Is that a bad thing?
[30:30.97]That's a bad thing, right?
[30:33.05]How do I do this?
[30:33.55]Is this a bad thing?
[30:41.40]Okay, I have a question.
[30:43.24]Do I have to break those?
[30:45.20]Does it count to my total crate count at the end?
[30:53.69]No.
[30:55.19]It's not that complicated.
[30:58.21]I'm just asking a very simple question.
[31:02.35]Okay, no help.
[31:03.25]This game came out in like 1994.
[31:04.85]What do you mean no help?
[31:08.63]Well, this one came out like yesterday or today, whatever it was.
[31:10.99]Those.
[31:17.68]Alright, so don't touch these.
[31:20.60]Oh, relax.
[31:31.66]I have to break them all.
[31:37.32]I'm just gonna go with the fact and assume that I don't.
[31:43.17]No!
[31:50.31]Okay, so there is a butt drop.
[31:52.19]I did it before.
[32:01.45]Hang?
[32:01.89]Ooh, oh.
[32:05.44]I missed a fucking box.
[32:21.91]I got a golden pear.
[32:28.07]You missed two.
[32:29.17]Whatever.
[32:34.38]percent playthrough this is a kind of sort of playthrough go back I don't I can't even go backwards why I've banned that person time that person up for 10 minutes
[33:07.41]Oh my god, I'm so mad at that person.
[33:16.74]No, and it ruined everything!
[33:17.96]How many lives do I have?
[33:27.19]Gotham Knights Contract.
[33:29.03]No SCORN.
[33:30.29]Signed here.
[33:31.51]It's the baseball signature.
[33:37.96]That's pretty good.
[33:38.55]I don't care if I get... Whatever.
[34:13.77]Okay.
[34:14.43]Move on, please.
[34:17.09]Oh.
[34:18.01]Uh-oh.
[34:19.73]Uh-oh.
[34:19.97]Timeless?
[34:27.58]Oh, that's like walking on a Dark Souls banister.
[34:44.21]I like this level.
[34:46.53]Oh.
[34:53.38]I thought that was a fucking button.
[34:54.60]Don't start me back.
[35:24.95]I like this game.
[35:26.10]I like it.
[35:26.44]It's tricky.
[35:39.83]I like it.
[35:40.23]It's tricky.
[35:53.96]I like it.
[35:55.30]I like it.
[35:56.30]It's tricky.
[36:03.80]I gotta get all 22.
[36:04.30]What does that do?
[36:12.51]Oh, it's... Alright, let me calculate this.
[36:19.00]Alright, calculated.
[36:37.22]Shit, thought there was... Alright, so now... I think it's gotta be this.
[36:47.28]Yup.
[36:47.80]Okay.
[36:54.91]Thank you.
[37:09.30]Pretty sick.
[37:15.88]Oh, secret!
[37:17.20]Outta here.
[37:47.16]Did I miss any behind me?
[37:50.46]No, we're good.
[37:56.71]Oh my god, it's gonna fall.
[38:02.15]Why did I do that?
[38:13.13]Dung, dung, dung, dung!
[38:17.93]Oh, dude, two low, two one-ups!
[38:34.16]Okay.
[38:36.58]So, what did I... Oh, okay, I know what I did wrong last time.
[39:03.19]Wait, wait a minute.
[39:06.79]Excuse me, what's under there?
[39:07.95]Nothing.
[39:11.54]OK.
[39:14.14]Can't.
[39:15.52]How?
[39:38.52]It just told me to crawl.
[39:46.21]Dude, there's a fucking invisible wall right there.
[39:48.17]Did I just get Luigi'd?
[39:50.57]There's an invisible wall.
[39:51.33]I thought I had to jump up there.
[39:52.13]Alright, why hold B to crawl?
[39:54.35]I don't get this.
[39:58.98]I actually just did that.
[40:01.22]Whatever, I don't care.
[40:06.01]I just, I did the NG teleporter kill.
[40:10.43]To myself.
[40:13.79]Alright, how we doing here?
[40:23.00]Oh my god, I didn't, I pressed the wrong button.
[40:33.39]I shouldn't crush them.
[40:42.25]Wait.
[41:00.64]I like the level design.
[41:01.54]It's actually really good.
[41:04.46]The level design is actually good.
[41:09.26]Sometimes they make a game like this and it, like, sucks.
[41:11.25]You know what I mean?
[41:17.27]Come on, get up there.
[41:29.88]Yeah!
[41:34.56]Damn it!
[41:40.31]Don't fall off.
[41:44.93]Destroys all nitro crates in this level.
[41:46.83]146.
[41:49.39]It's alright.
[41:50.49]I'll take it.
[41:50.95]I'll take it.
[41:56.40]Is my FPS dropping on my camera?
[42:02.36]A little bit.
[42:11.33]Restart the level.
[42:23.22]Wait, I can restart, wait.
[42:25.30]Play level.
[42:28.62]Time to beat, is that one hour and 39 minutes?
[42:32.16]Wait, do I actually fight against a ghost?
[42:40.25]Do you actually see the ghost on screen?
[42:53.02]I did not beat this level in a minute and 39 seconds.
[43:00.74]This took me like 20 minutes.
[43:04.92]Do I get to... Is it like a... Okay, here we go.
[43:08.94]Oh, let's go!
[43:13.27]He's a fucking idiot.
[43:13.97]He's gonna fall like three times at this part.
[43:17.18]Hey, wait.
[43:19.50]What the fuck?
[43:28.48]That's not me.
[43:29.12]I didn't do that.
[43:32.40]That's not even me.
[43:34.44]It's a speed run.
[43:36.08]Oh.
[43:37.92]Oh, I thought that was me.
[43:39.17]I thought it was like a ghost thing like in Mario Kart.
[43:54.56]Alright, let's go.
[43:58.37]It's a speedrun.
[43:59.07]I thought I was racing against a ghost.
[44:00.99]Like, in Mario Kart.
[44:03.71]Stop referencing Mario.
[44:07.05]It's the most celebrated video game franchise in human history.
[44:11.32]Guys, the cavemen even knew who the fuck Mario was.
[44:15.18]You cannot not make Mario references.
[44:41.43]I'll be very honest, I really thought this was going to be kind of shit.
[44:46.39]I'm going to be just very upfront.
[44:47.69]I just didn't think I was going to care.
[44:48.87]I thought it was going to be like each one of these levels is kind of just, oh, it's like world one, one, one, two, one, three, one, four, one, five.
[44:58.04]And they're all like the exact same.
[45:00.36]There's like no difference.
[45:01.44]It's just kind of a slightly different level with different platforms.
[45:03.70]But each one of these levels seems pretty different.
[45:06.24]I like the design so far.
[45:08.18]Game Critic Andy.
[45:10.65]I like the design.
[45:11.37]I like what they've done with this so far.
[45:14.93]Like, what the fuck?
[45:15.47]Who cares what I think?
[45:16.27]I eat boogers.
[45:17.23]Like, you know what I mean?
[45:17.87]Like, who cares what I think?
[45:22.14]What is in here?
[45:44.02]Wait, don't forget about the savers.
[45:48.05]Yeah, I got to get this out of me.
[45:48.97]I have to get out of my system.
[45:50.59]I can't say eat boogers on the sponsored part of the screen.
[46:11.43]Who made this game?
[46:12.49]Is it... What's the company?
[46:14.01]Don't touch that!
[46:14.67]Go back!
[46:16.49]No, go back!
[46:16.99]I want to go back!
[46:17.43]I want to go back!
[46:17.85]Just die!
[46:18.19]How do I fall off?
[46:20.15]How do you fall?
[46:20.69]Okay.
[46:28.30]That's nothing.
[46:29.08]I think I just lost a level.
[46:32.68]What is that then?
[46:35.90]Whatever.
[46:46.23]Oh, shit.
[46:46.87]No!
[46:47.79]Whatever.
[46:52.62]What's that?
[46:56.53]What's that?
[47:15.74]How do I get that?
[47:16.30]I keep missing it.
[47:32.49]I don't know how to get that.
[47:37.41]Oh, yes I do.
[47:38.67]Are you stupid?
[47:39.49]How do I get up?
[47:48.59]What did that do?
[48:00.06]Ooh, that's what it was.
[48:00.88]Is that what it was?
[48:07.34]What's your favorite 2D platformer of all time?
[48:16.86]I really kind of don't like them that much.
[48:20.62]I enjoy them, but not really enough to care that much to have a favorite.
[48:33.17]I enjoy them, but it's not like, oh, wow, my favorite.
[48:40.35]Name some iconic platformers.
[48:41.85]I'll tell you if I play them.
[48:43.97]I mean, Mario, yeah, but I mean, that's the easy question.
[48:50.65]Celeste was really good, yep.
[48:51.95]Celeste was very good.
[48:53.99]It's probably up there.
[49:01.48]Doodle jump?
[49:02.84]I never played it.
[49:06.34]This is not timed, right?
[49:07.48]Yoshi's Island?
[49:08.20]Yoshi's Island was pretty good.
[49:12.54]How do I tackle this?
[49:19.64]How do I tackle this?
[49:22.26]How do I tackle this?
[49:23.04]I don't know.
[49:27.68]I definitely can turn this back on, right?
[49:30.20]Let's see.
[49:31.02]Because I don't want to get rid of them.
[49:44.69]Is there... Oh yeah, there it is.
[49:52.01]Oh.
[49:54.83]OK.
[50:02.24]Very cool.
[50:03.06]Alright, there we go, right?
[50:06.58]22.
[50:06.60]20.
[50:07.72]Where's 24?
[50:10.44]Oh my God, I didn't leave one.
[50:19.83]Oh, that sucks.
[50:21.01]What did I miss?
[50:27.58]I have to leave at least one there.
[50:36.64]There's one above here.
[50:45.57]What the fuck?
[50:47.33]What happened?
[50:47.91]Oh my goodness.
[50:48.99]I thought I jumped.
[50:51.03]Something wrong with this dude?
[51:02.89]I love how hard it is.
[51:04.75]It doesn't hold your hand.
[51:16.78]My favorite part is that it doesn't hold your hand.
[51:19.54]Oh, there it is.
[51:28.32]Left one, there we go, okay.
[51:53.41]Don't miss.
[51:57.73]This thing can crush me, right?
[52:01.51]It almost happened.
[52:02.27]I almost have a three.
[52:07.90]No.
[52:15.58]Don't die.
[52:16.47]There's no checkpoint.
[52:38.75]Why is that here?
[52:41.51]Here it is.
[52:42.21]Yeah!
[52:54.48]Okay.
[52:54.64]Do I have 100% so far?
[52:57.40]I think I do.
[52:57.90]I think I have 100%.
[53:10.83]No, go back.
[53:11.53]Oops.
[53:20.36]What the fuck just happened?
[53:21.82]I thought that stuck out further.
[53:39.92]Confused.
[53:50.16]Okay, you have to do a super jump.
[53:54.37]I... Seriously.
[53:56.79]The super jump, I was still pressing it, so I ground pounded down.
[54:14.76]Okay.
[54:17.44]Here we go.
[54:17.93]Alright, we're good.
[54:34.12]Did I get everything?
[54:38.04]I can't tell.
[54:39.02]I actually really don't know.
[54:40.30]That way?
[54:43.42]Nothing touched me.
[54:47.62]Nothing touched me.
[54:53.12]Come on.
[54:53.58]But you only need that edge.
[54:57.44]Because this show will melt your face off.
[55:04.10]Oh, this is hurting my brain a little.
[55:05.52]Okay.
[55:11.56]Oh, shit.
[55:12.68]Okay, I'm good.
[55:15.15]No!
[55:18.47]What happened?
[55:19.13]What, did it hurt my butt?
[55:44.39]What?
[55:47.38]Okay, we're good.
[55:48.32]Nice.
[55:50.10]Is that it that's over here?
[55:51.00]I can jump on top of that.
[55:52.14]Alright, now what?
[55:55.08]Just gonna go for it.
[56:00.40]That was the dumbest fucking thing I've done in like a month.
[56:03.19]That was the dumbest thing I've done in like two months.
[56:10.35]Why did I do that?
[56:14.06]I used to do that shit in Mario 3.
[56:15.28]With Super Mario World, right?
[56:19.67]You would, like, do the boing, boing, boing.
[56:21.96]And you didn't even care where you were going.
[56:23.92]You just knew you were going right.
[56:41.64]I'm gonna fucking- You gotta be kid- That doesn't make any sense.
[56:44.88]I can't feel it.
[56:45.72]You can't stop a ground pound, dude.
[56:51.38]Now I'm just- Okay, I'm pissed right now.
[56:53.10]It's B. B- Okay.
[56:55.27]B is do big jump, but B is also ground pound.
[56:59.31]So I keep hitting, like, okay, I'm gonna do a jump, and I'm holding B, and I'm still holding B, but I accidentally touched it again.
[57:12.47]Oh, a shitty craftsman blames his tools.
[57:25.24]It's not hard at all.
[57:26.26]I just can't do it.
[57:35.79]Oh, wait, it's right bumper.
[57:37.81]Oh, that's way better.
[57:38.59]Okay, thank you.
[57:47.26]Oh my god, I pressed... Okay, I swear to god I'm not doing this on purpose.
[57:50.02]I flipped it.
[57:52.08]Why is Switch... I swear to god I'm not doing this for, like, funny... Look at this, like, funny compilation of this fucking idiot that can't play Crash Bandicoot correctly.
[58:03.03]Why is Switch the, you know, the... Whatever the... The phasing.
[58:23.63]Okay.
[58:25.11]Come on, dude.
[58:29.07]Should I go this way?
[58:34.16]No, there's nothing over here.
[58:41.58]That's all that's over there.
[58:43.96]That's it.
[58:44.24]Alright, finally.
[58:48.54]Made it.
[58:51.26]Oh, this is a bad run.
[58:52.40]Anything down here?
[58:53.56]I don't care.
[58:56.89]Whatever.
[58:57.17]I'll take it.
[59:04.79]Can I buy a skin?
[59:05.55]I probably don't have to buy a skin.
[59:11.19]Should I?
[59:17.49]Is it a puppet?
[59:22.31]Flashback tapes unlocked.
[59:23.67]Rewind time back to the 90s.
[59:25.27]Play flashback tapes to experience Crash and Coco's training in Neo Cortex's test chambers.
[59:34.36]What does that mean?
[59:34.80]Let's find out.
[59:42.46]Unlocking... No, I can't.
[59:45.81]Alright, we'll go with this one.
[59:47.99]Let's see.
[59:49.13]Subject 218.
[59:50.89]Flashback tapes.
[59:54.30]Are these like super challenges or something?
[59:59.39]This looks hard.
[60:03.27]What?
[60:21.30]Cool.
[60:28.02]Oh, I like this.
[60:30.55]It's like a little puzzle.
[60:46.67]Oops.
[60:47.67]Oh shit.
[60:48.07]It's okay.
[60:51.83]anymore.
[60:54.85]No!
[60:56.31]Shit!
[60:56.57]Alright, I'll do it again.
[61:00.33]I'll do it again.
[61:00.67]I'll do it again.
[61:02.81]I thought it was gonna break when I jumped.
[61:04.29]I thought it was gonna break when I jumped left and then over.
[61:06.99]I thought that was the only... Whatever.
[61:42.01]One, two, three, four, five.
[62:05.73]Yes.
[62:05.99]Okay, I got them all.
[62:06.85]He's still alive?
[62:08.53]Interesting.
[63:08.68]Alright.
[63:09.48]Nice.
[63:12.94]Got them all.
[63:14.34]Got it.
[63:14.66]118.
[63:14.98]So what do I get?
[63:17.40]I like those.
[63:17.94]These are fun.
[63:24.18]Cool.
[63:24.75]What do I get for that?
[63:25.55]Okay.
[63:37.89]Hit the road.
[63:40.13]I almost hit the boss.
[63:46.72]Hey, Bruce Wayne here.
[63:47.46]I'll pay you a billion dollars if you do a SCORN.
[63:51.04]I don't want a billion dollars.
[63:52.36]I just don't.
[64:05.81]I don't want a billion dollars.
[64:06.90]No, fuck that.
[64:07.84]No.
[64:27.52]Look at these levels.
[64:32.72]Look at how many baseball streams you could do with that.
[64:34.64]Oh, okay.
[64:36.74]Are you talking about like a personal income?
[64:39.84]Like personal money you get?
[64:41.02]Or are you talking about like financing stuff?
[64:43.98]How did I go behind that?
[64:46.85]Are you talking about like company?
[64:50.45]Like I got a billion dollar company and I can make like whatever I want.
[64:58.41]I don't want, I don't personally want a billion dollars.
[65:02.05]But if I had like a billion dollar valued company, okay, well, what, how many employees do I have?
[65:07.78]What do my sales look like?
[65:09.22]I don't want a fucking billion dollars.
[65:10.46]No way.
[65:13.36]When you cross the billion dollar threshold, that's when you start to go like, oh, you know, I had a dream that I had a bowling alley in my fucking living room.
[65:21.78]So I'm going to do it.
[65:22.58]It's like, I don't know, man.
[65:23.32]I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to do that.
[65:28.10]Hey, you know what?
[65:28.74]I feel like this very specific type of cheese this afternoon.
[65:32.52]Get it!
[65:33.44]And like somebody gets on a plane and flies to get this cheese from Italy to bring it to you.
[65:37.01]Because you wanted it today.
[65:38.75]I don't know.
[65:39.41]I feel like that's too much.
[65:40.81]That's way too much power.
[65:42.27]I don't want it.
[65:42.61]And I died.
[65:53.77]Oh, there is a jump on the head.
[65:55.20]Okay.
[66:07.61]If I ever had a billion dollars in money, I'm being completely honest.
[66:13.84]I would take 10 million.
[66:14.69]No, 20 million.
[66:15.07]Yeah.
[66:19.64]I would take $20 million and just keep it for anything I ever wanted.
[66:23.97]And then I would just, like, I don't know.
[66:25.05]I would go try to rebuild as many schools in America as I could.
[66:28.81]Right?
[66:29.19]And just, like, just do it.
[66:32.43]But I'm keeping $25 million.
[66:33.97]I am.
[66:34.65]I'm sorry.
[66:36.01]No, maybe even $50.
[66:39.39]I want $50.
[66:40.45]Why can I not kill this fucking guy?
[66:44.14]That's, like, two schools.
[66:45.84]Well...
[66:49.95]I don't know, maybe, how much, okay, you had 800 million dollars.
[66:56.41]Like, could you cover, like, half the textbooks that, like, college students would need to buy in America?
[67:03.26]How much would you need?
[67:03.78]And it'd be, like, it'd be, like, the, like, the, I don't know.
[67:10.54]No.
[67:11.84]Would that be for, like, one school?
[67:16.67]No, a billion dollars to buy text?
[67:19.65]No way, for one school?
[67:21.17]What the fuck's happening to their education?
[67:26.95]I've touched that every time.
[67:38.88]Anything else?
[67:40.98]Yeah, I'm keeping 20 million.
[67:46.76]You bet your ass I'm gonna buy that vintage Pac-Man machine.
[67:50.50]Signed by Pac-Man.
[67:56.34]You know I'm buying that.
[68:14.22]The Pac-Man?
[68:15.11]That's what I'm saying.
[68:23.40]How come I can't get this?
[68:30.71]Why is it grayed out?
[68:35.34]Why are you acting like you're not already a billionaire cheese heir?
[68:56.61]Oh shit.
[68:56.95]Shouldn't have done that.
[69:00.65]I have to come back.
[69:01.43]I think, yeah.
[69:08.40]Okay.
[69:09.08]I got it.
[69:09.36]Do you not have any makeup on today?
[69:14.04]No, I shaved my face.
[69:16.34]Yes, guys.
[69:17.96]I'm way far behind.
[69:18.85]Guys, humans look a little different when they change their hairstyle and their facial hair.
[69:25.31]Shaved the makeup off.
[69:31.56]Oh, what?
[69:32.28]I got a face of makeup on.
[69:33.50]It's time to shave it.
[69:39.46]Wait, no.
[69:40.06]This is wrong.
[69:44.37]Where's the thing?
[69:44.97]Back here?
[69:49.41]There.
[69:49.61]Okay.
[69:51.61]Okay.
[69:59.87]Let's go.
[70:06.24]Okay, didn't hit it.
[70:10.82]Looks good.
[70:12.44]Am I doing this right though?
[70:13.54]I don't know.
[70:18.20]I'm kind of afraid.
[70:26.43]Guys.
[70:26.77]I think you have to slide and just jump.
[70:31.23]Can you do it?
[70:31.61]Okay, I can do a slide jump.
[70:36.81]Like Breath of the Wild?
[70:41.73]Maybe eventually.
[70:42.25]Do I have this first part accurate though?
[70:48.83]I don't want to step on this yet, right?
[70:54.84]I think that's correct.
[70:55.90]And then I get these and then I step on it?
[71:17.58]Oh my god, how did I not die?
[71:19.14]Alright, now I go turn them back on, right?
[71:28.69]I turn it on because now I have to destroy them.
[71:44.20]Okay.
[71:46.81]Nice.
[71:47.73]There it is.
[71:48.83]Alright.
[71:52.39]What are you doing?
[71:53.37]Shit, I fucked it up.
[72:18.32]I just poured, I just opened up the spout and went over to a chef making like a three day far and just dumped salt in it.
[72:28.63]Just around the corner, just held it out with the spout.
[72:30.71]Like ruined everything.
[72:32.69]I have to lose.
[72:52.24]Will the nitro destroy the blocks that aren't active?
[73:01.32]No, it won't work.
[73:05.08]They have to be active, right?
[73:10.86]I'm going to test it.
[73:12.64]I'm testing this.
[73:15.87]What even?
[73:16.79]Why did it explode?
[73:17.61]It's because I touched it.
[73:19.28]Oh, fuck.
[73:19.90]Okay.
[73:20.78]I thought you had to break it to have it blow up, not touch it.
[73:22.82]Okay.
[73:54.57]Okay, let's try this.
[73:58.07]Don't do that.
[73:58.85]Okay, so don't break anything because I don't... Let's see what happens.
[74:07.54]Did that work?
[74:10.62]I don't know.
[74:12.44]It did, right?
[74:15.02]It did.
[74:19.88]Thank God.
[74:49.39]Yes!
[74:59.41]Just don't get killed because I don't have a checkpoint.
[75:03.97]This game is so brutal.
[75:05.19]It does not fucking hold your hand.
[75:08.03]God, that's why I like it though.
[75:09.41]Game doesn't hold your hand.
[75:14.83]This is brutal.
[75:36.47]Swing already.
[75:37.15]Jesus.
[75:39.17]Oh, you can't be fucking serious.
[75:41.31]You hit me with the back swing?
[75:45.14]You weren't even in the middle of a swing and you hit me.
[75:47.30]Okay, thank god I don't have to do the bonus again.
[76:13.68]How do I see the hut again?
[76:14.38]Okay.
[76:22.28]Oh, that's crazy.
[76:23.14]You should eat an apple on stream.
[76:25.14]I don't know why.
[76:27.94]That's a weird request.
[76:31.09]Don't you think so?
[76:36.73]Oh, dude.
[76:37.03]Eat an apple on stream.
[76:37.89]Why?
[76:38.35]That's a weird request.
[76:41.17]And I lost because of that person.
[76:49.72]I don't know what the fuck I thought.
[76:50.62]I thought it was going to fall.
[77:14.17]Oh.
[77:16.35]Is it coming back down?
[77:22.63]Just have patience, please.
[77:23.67]Get an apple.
[77:31.09]I don't like apples.
[77:35.58]I like Macintosh apples and that's it.
[77:39.90]Green apples are okay.
[77:42.80]We already did the tier list thing.
[77:43.84]You already know.
[78:02.68]Oh my god!
[78:03.90]Yeah, it's okay.
[78:30.32]What the fuck, man?
[78:31.68]What?
[78:36.66]You aren't very good at this?
[78:37.70]This game is notoriously difficult.
[78:39.79]It even says it on the box.
[78:52.27]Alright, let me see if I can get this right.
[78:57.59]Nope.
[78:59.73]You can't get up there from that way.
[79:06.50]Yeah, this bullshit.
[79:07.66]Some of you guys have told me that you have permanent bite marks on your PlayStation 1 controller because of this game.
[79:18.00]I just forgot how to play.
[79:19.15]I'm...
[79:40.73]Oh, I thought it was already there.
[80:02.79]Stop.
[80:04.27]Wait, I need to break this.
[80:07.14]Can I break this without breaking that?
[80:09.72]Yeah, okay.
[80:10.63]Shit.
[80:17.65]Come on, hurry up.
[80:30.92]Sorry.
[80:37.64]How do I get up there?
[80:38.32]I think I have to fall.
[80:44.07]Checkpoint, thank god.
[80:44.99]How do I get up there?
[80:58.39]Ooh.
[80:59.39]Um.
[80:59.59]Okay.
[81:03.93]How am I supposed to do this?
[81:08.36]Got it.
[81:10.34]Diamond.
[81:13.06]I need to destroy this.
[81:16.10]How am I going to do that?
[81:19.64]How do I break that without getting hurt?
[81:23.70]Oh, okay.
[81:23.94]It will.
[81:24.52]It will.
[81:25.02]Alright.
[81:26.00]It will blow up.
[81:39.05]Oh my god, I didn't even see what was happening.
[81:41.51]Did I get this?
[81:42.07]I got that, right?
[81:43.76]Yeah.
[82:34.43]This game is way harder than the Spongebob game.
[82:46.08]Come on, are you kidding me?
[82:47.26]I jumped behind.
[82:49.22]I jumped behind it.
[82:49.96]I think I can still get it.
[82:53.10]Yeah, alright, we're good.
[83:24.09]This game's hard.
[83:35.35]This game's kinda hard.
[83:37.17]I'm scared.
[83:38.26]Okay, you can still jump.
[83:51.10]I didn't think you could.
[84:18.83]It's hard to get all those.
[84:20.05]That's so fucking hard.
[84:24.67]Part 2.
[84:39.73]Jesus.
[84:47.96]Nice.
[84:48.34]Oh.
[84:49.28]How come there's no taunt?
[85:10.29]I can't be like, boom.
[85:12.93]It should be.
[85:15.81]Ah, that's unfortunate.
[85:16.47]It's okay.
[85:17.67]That's still a lot.
[85:24.30]You get this game for a kid that you hate.
[85:26.66]What?
[85:31.14]The game's very good.
[85:34.97]It's a very... This is a very good game.
[85:48.72]Alright, this is it.
[85:49.30]Alright, let's switch to... This one.
[86:00.50]Alright, this is a boss.
[86:01.20]Let's do it.
[86:11.29]Alright.
[86:46.43]Alright, target.
[86:48.85]Oh, I gotta get up there.
[86:49.59]Alright, go.
[86:53.11]Come on, Crash!
[86:54.15]Hurry!
[87:00.15]Come on, Crash!
[87:01.35]Hurry!
[87:04.25]Oh, in the fucking back of the head.
[87:16.94]Come on, Sora!
[87:20.34]I didn't get the Sora right, but I got everything else.
[87:38.14]You gonna throw somebody out here already?
[87:39.56]Alright, let's go.
[87:49.19]Oh shit.
[87:59.99]Play Kingdom Hearts?
[88:02.21]No, I'm sorry, I don't have a spare 400 hours to play that on stream.
[88:10.91]That's just for the opening cutscene, so I don't have time for that.
[88:15.29]Oh my god, I died.
[88:19.50]Did I start over?
[88:20.02]No.
[88:37.85]And you and I Kingdom Hearts 2 That's all I remember.
[88:59.61]One more.
[89:03.11]Oh shit.
[89:05.57]Oh, okay.
[89:06.19]Excuse me.
[89:17.01]This is some frogger shit right now.
[89:24.73]Oh my god, I misspelled.
[89:34.72]Where'd they go?
[89:37.22]Are you kidding me?
[89:53.88]Ugh!
[90:06.62]Oh, what a bad place to stop for a second.
[90:18.97]See ya.
[90:22.37]Phase two.
[90:29.17]I don't think so.
[90:40.41]My beautiful creation.
[90:45.30]Ah!
[90:48.04]Akano!
[90:49.08]Score.
[91:11.50]Ooh, I like the way this one looks.
[91:17.01]Cool.
[91:21.41]Booty Calls.
[91:27.06]He looks so proud of himself.
[91:40.17]Mom said it was my turn.
[91:46.90]Well, it can be all of our turns.
[91:48.86]With Cloud Gaming.
[92:00.99]Whoa.
[92:07.89]I don't think I can hurt them.
[92:25.85]Yeah, what a great idea.
[92:30.29]You honestly think that would be a smart decision today?
[92:34.64]Do you think that's a good idea today?
[92:36.68]Think about it.
[92:37.18]I just want you to think about what you just said.
[92:40.76]I want you to think it's a good idea.
[92:41.94]I don't think the answer is yes.
[92:46.04]I think the answer is a 100% no.
[92:55.75]Yeah, fucking... The fuck you have rivers of blood bullshit.
[93:01.84]They should pass that shit out of the game already.
[93:12.95]They did.
[93:15.83]Good.
[93:29.63]Oh, you can hit people.
[93:30.29]That's cool.
[93:32.17]I like this outfit.
[93:34.90]You don't play Elden Ring anymore.
[93:38.50]Yeah, because I need to forget every single thing that happens in the game.
[93:43.04]And then once every year or two, go back and play the whole thing again.
[93:46.08]That's how it works.
[93:51.47]Did I get that?
[93:55.05]I guess I already got it.
[94:00.37]The best part about the FromSoftware games is you just forget about them for a year or two.
[94:05.40]Come back and play a class you never played before.
[94:08.02]And it's just a completely different video game.
[94:12.98]It's the best way to do it.
[94:17.38]Alright, can I even attack this guy?
[94:19.52]Or jump on his head, right?
[94:24.81]The DLC is coming.
[94:29.30]Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[94:48.17]Anything up here?
[94:49.53]Nope.
[94:52.94]Did you do me strong?
[94:54.40]No, I didn't.
[94:57.58]I floundered.
[94:58.64]I flaked on me strong.
[95:00.44]Should I just die?
[95:13.03]Just die.
[95:13.39]I don't want to miss that.
[95:18.91]It's way too important.
[95:33.83]Okay.
[95:40.95]Why would it be a question mark if I know what it is?
[95:53.52]Excuse me, how do I get over there?
[95:54.64]Did you see that?
[96:12.40]good enough that was hard actually getting 100 there would be difficult and there was a whole another thing called that section with um you know what I mean you know what I'm saying
[96:44.51]Everything from here to all the way down there looks really nice.
[96:47.37]You understand?
[96:51.27]My webcam's getting annoying.
[96:52.17]Hold on.
[96:53.11]We gotta change this.
[96:59.03]Better?
[96:59.23]Not as much movement?
[97:03.35]Yeah, that's better.
[97:14.71]The lights are going down for Gotham Knights though, you better believe it.
[97:17.59]And by the way... Nobody said anything about the shirt today.
[97:43.56]Can we please get a Bane impression during the Gotham Knights game?
[97:48.95]Yeah.
[97:58.08]Which one?
[97:58.36]Do you want the iconic today?
[98:01.02]Right?
[98:01.94]That's the iconic line.
[98:03.74]I can do that.
[98:05.36]I think I can handle that.
[98:19.32]That was a bad idea.
[98:20.27]I'm in trouble.
[98:21.35]Does it come back?
[98:25.09]Thank god.
[98:38.49]Troll.
[98:55.54]Dude, there's no opportunity to go anywhere.
[98:57.76]I'm going back because I don't want to miss any cubes.
[99:00.87]I don't care.
[99:30.79]I have the exact same acne as you right now.
[99:34.70]What?
[99:34.88]You mean this?
[99:44.56]No, I caught myself shaving.
[99:48.28]That's a shave cut.
[99:57.80]Yeah, that's a shave cut.
[100:04.70]It's a giant pimple.
[100:06.13]It's not.
[100:06.81]It's a shaving cut.
[100:14.69]We'll blow that one up too.
[100:18.96]Okay.
[100:27.68]Okay.
[100:34.16]What do we do about this?
[100:39.30]Why was it there the last time when you had facial hair?
[100:45.08]It wasn't?
[100:48.67]How do I break that without getting hurt?
[100:52.49]It was.
[100:52.83]No, it wasn't.
[101:02.60]It was not.
[101:14.83]22, there it is.
[101:17.65]How do I get out of here?
[101:23.90]We should grow a Gandalf Fury.
[101:36.14]I don't know if I grew a Gandalf beard I probably would like get it all scooped up and like twist it and like put it in my mouth and be like I don't know and people be like what the fuck is he doing?
[101:50.00]Like how did you start choking on your beard?
[102:37.68]Like dude, bro, like how did that even happen?
[102:41.29]How did that happen?
[103:04.87]It's not even that fucking funny.
[103:06.91]It's just everybody hates it.
[103:09.51]Everyone's like fucking pissed.
[103:12.04]That's what's doing it for me right now.
[103:13.52]Everybody is pissed that I just said that.
[103:16.80]That's just stupid.
[103:17.70]Why is everybody so mad?
[103:24.63]Okay, I'm gonna play the game.
[103:41.48]I just keep picturing... I picture Gandalf.
[103:44.66]I keep seeing Gandalf in my head.
[103:46.51]With like his whole beard in his mouth.
[103:48.85]And he's running around going like... And like they come into the room like Frodo and like, I don't know, Sam.
[103:55.77]And they're like, Gandalf, what's happening?
[103:58.60]And he's like freaking out, running around like smash and bumping into bookshelves and shit.
[104:05.64]That must have been a ringwraith.
[104:19.53]No!
[104:19.95]I told you it was a weird day today.
[104:44.47]I did warn you.
[104:45.19]I was very clear.
[104:47.82]Why are you still laughing at it?
[104:48.93]I don't fucking know, dude.
[104:50.35]I don't know.
[104:50.87]I don't know.
[104:55.51]It's because the chat's reaction was too good.
[105:08.50]Stop!
[105:09.14]I hit him with that.
[105:42.13]I feel like something's heading up here, right?
[105:43.47]No?
[105:50.63]Three?
[105:50.97]Nice.
[105:51.17]I don't know if I know this.
[105:54.47]I don't know.
[105:55.97]That's a lot of money.
[106:01.89]Dude, Frog Detective 3 is coming out on October 26th.
[106:04.03]Please, you're going to play it, right?
[106:05.53]Yeah, probably.
[106:21.31]Alright, let me get to the end of this section.
[106:24.71]Let me do the boss here.
[106:26.15]This is a great game.
[106:26.93]I like it.
[106:35.61]I don't know.
[106:35.97]Do you think we go right into Gotham Knights?
[106:37.49]What are you guys thinking?
[106:39.19]You guys feel good?
[106:39.73]I want to play this for a little bit longer.
[106:58.72]Yeah, I'll take a pee break.
[107:01.20]Maybe another few minutes of this.
[107:02.12]Another like... I want to beat the boss here.
[107:09.74]Wait, who am I?
[107:11.12]My new character?
[107:13.47]This is a different character.
[107:18.97]Who is this?
[107:41.89]Well, I never mind.
[107:43.53]I think the story ended pretty quickly.
[107:52.70]Dude, I can't get the image of Gandalf out of my head.
[107:55.48]It's up there permanently.
[108:01.74]Hookshot?
[108:09.93]Whoa.
[108:12.71]Does it do damage?
[108:13.85]It does do damage.
[108:14.91]Alright.
[108:22.73]Cool.
[108:26.48]Very cool.
[108:27.00]Alright.
[108:37.79]Okay.
[108:45.37]Wall jump?
[108:50.41]That's pretty clean, I like it.
[108:57.58]Are there emotes?
[109:07.45]That's clean, I like it a lot.
[109:09.21]That's a very clean move.
[109:23.37]Trying to do my joke.
[109:26.89]I could probably do a pretty good scorpion.
[109:28.19]I'll try it.
[109:28.49]It's going to be loud.
[109:31.85]I'm going to do it loud, so just be ready.
[109:36.22]I think I could probably do a pretty good job.
[110:07.44]Colonel!
[110:08.88]Get over here!
[110:11.29]Come here!
[110:12.67]That's alright, it was okay.
[110:24.56]Needs a little work, yeah.
[110:32.44]Try to grab this stupid fucking thing.
[110:57.34]I gotta go for the stun.
[110:58.38]Stunned.
[110:59.66]Stunned.
[111:00.72]Got him.
[111:00.92]How do I get that?
[111:32.86]That thing says you're gonna die.
[111:33.92]Watch out for the shocks!
[111:52.38]Nice.
[112:16.37]What are you talking about?
[112:17.57]You just literally turned around.
[112:18.95]I'm rushing.
[114:07.63]Alright, I can't touch them at all, even if the back is to me.
[114:16.57]You know what?
[114:17.63]I don't need to fight you.
[114:18.49]What the hell am I even doing?
[114:19.33]Who cares?
[114:25.86]I feel like that was there for a reason.
[114:26.96]I don't know what though.
[114:31.00]Probably was there for a reason, right?
[115:35.11]Much better.
[115:35.63]Much better.
[115:43.18]There we go.
[115:52.26]Oh boy.
[115:52.50]96 out of 100.

[116:51.42]Yeah, you could say that.
[116:54.84]What did we, like, die or something?
[116:56.72]What?
[116:57.00]No!
[116:57.43]Nope.

[117:57.54]OK.
[118:00.36]I'm going to do the tape.
[118:05.48]Oh, wait, I already.
[118:08.22]How come there's no other tapes?
[118:14.91]How come you're not talking?
[118:15.73]I am talking right now.
[118:17.29]You have to find them in levels without dying.
[118:24.91]Oh, shit.
[118:25.67]Okay.
[118:27.01]Good to know.
[118:33.34]After this boss, we'll move on to the Gotham Knights.
[118:38.18]Seems fun.
[118:47.36]I just tried to grapple hook.
[118:48.24]That was a mistake.
[118:50.86]I'm not gonna get the tape on this one.
[118:51.92]I get it, though.
[119:01.85]I swear to God, I don't even fucking get it.
[119:07.05]I get it.
[119:08.05]Talk louder.
[119:08.81]Why would I talk louder?
[119:10.93]What is... No.
[119:11.21]This is the volume I'm gonna be speaking.. If you get a problem...
[119:20.74]I don't know what to tell you.
[119:29.05]So what character should I... I mean, I'm starting with Nightwing, right?
[119:31.81]I'm going to be playing with Nightwing.
[119:34.07]Oh my goodness.
[119:35.09]That was... What did he hit me with?
[119:36.41]Holy shit.
[119:39.76]I just flew off the screen.
[119:43.14]I had like 600% in multiverses.
[119:45.00]Or Smash Bros.
[119:45.64]Multiverses.
[119:46.22]Let.
[119:46.44]Let me say multiverses.
[119:47.64]I had 600% in multiverses.
[120:15.19]Stripe is fun.
[120:16.69]I played with him for a little while.
[120:24.05]I think I'm too stupid for Rick.
[120:27.04]Too many gadgets.
[120:31.50]Come on.
[120:34.88]Oh my god.
[120:35.76]Alright, this game now just got really hard.
[120:37.30]Time to stop messing around.
[120:44.29]Actually pay attention.
[120:45.27]One hit and you die.
[120:46.17]This is old retro game.
[121:12.48]Holy shit.
[121:19.51]Young Sheldon?
[121:22.87]What's the reference?
[121:23.53]Are you saying that I look like Young Sheldon?
[121:25.61]I don't know what the reference is.
[121:27.97]That would be weird.
[121:35.95]True?
[121:36.79]What the fuck?
[121:41.07]Ooh, cool.
[122:03.05]are you guys talking about what it's not even it's not even remotely close by the way not even close
[122:33.14]What does it save this file to?
[122:36.35]Save image.
[122:42.63]Where'd it go?
[122:46.07]Young Sheldon.
[122:49.57]Save.
[122:50.25]Okay.
[122:52.25]Where is it?
[122:55.43]What the fuck?
[122:58.01]I can't save this file on my computer.
[123:05.53]Should I call it like PNG or something?
[123:07.78]How do I get it to show up here?
[123:13.58]Here we go.
[123:22.91]Get that fucking off full screen.
[123:25.93]Okay.
[123:26.45]How do you see this?
[123:39.50]This is not even close.
[123:41.16]It's not even close.
[124:04.06]It's not even close.
[124:42.42]I don't look like this kid!
[124:43.86]I don't look like... I don't!
[124:50.51]Right?
[124:53.69]That was actually kind of scary.
[124:55.03]Okay.
[124:59.06]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[125:07.36]You just... Yeah, I just... Oh yeah, I have human facial features.
[125:09.69]Oh well.
[125:12.50]So what?
[125:13.36]I look like other humans.
[125:15.96]That's weird.
[125:16.60]I don't even... Okay, I don't look like young Sheldon.
[125:22.29]I don't look like young Sheldon.
[125:23.91]I don't look like young Sheldon.
[125:26.05]I don't.
[125:26.67]Holy shit.
[125:37.78]Okay, I didn't think I was going to blow him up.
[125:40.87]I don't look like Young Sheldon.
[125:42.27]I don't look like Young Sheldon.
[125:52.51]We got a raid that came in from... Who did that?
[125:55.56]Pat stares at.
[125:56.56]Thanks, Pat.
[125:59.42]Welcome, everybody.
[126:01.72]Are they just coming to the Young Sheldon part?
[126:35.27]I can't, but I, alright.
[126:36.90]I'll do this one more time.
[126:38.06]I'm gonna do this one more time because there's another person apparently that I look just like.
[126:46.03]And we're gonna find out who that is.
[126:47.95]This is apparently, I look just like this too.
[127:12.95]What angle is this?
[127:17.46]No, what the fuck was that face?
[127:18.76]That's like the Joker.
[128:41.37]That's not my webcam.
[128:42.84]I thought it was for a second.
[128:43.90]Okay, hold on.
[128:55.16]Oh, shit.
[128:55.74]I stretched it.
[128:56.24]Is that normal?
[129:03.89]It's weird how just simply stretching a little bit makes you look so fucked up.
[129:07.25]Alright, that was fun.
[129:17.74]Something's still wrong, though.
[129:35.06]Should I keep this for the Gotham Knights portion?
[129:40.58]Just that my head's a little too squished.
[129:42.55]It's like, why is my face so thin?
[129:47.97]I actually don't think I can get this right.
[129:49.11]There we go.
[129:50.16]That's fine.
[129:50.76]Let's go.
[130:20.87]Dude, can I, like, take a portion of the webcam and make my, like, forehead bigger?
[130:24.51]You know what I mean?
[130:26.71]Just have, like, a big forehead.
[130:31.85]Maybe.
[130:42.03]Dude, I can't.
[130:42.85]Okay, pay attention for one goddamn second of your life.
[130:46.94]I have to just jump over there and wait.
[131:09.67]Do big cheeks?
[131:46.80]Am I alright?
[131:47.36]I need a glass of water, dude.
[131:50.81]I need a glass of water or something.
[131:53.43]I need like a peanut butter.
[131:55.11]Like a jar of peanut butter.
[132:02.87]Okay.
[132:06.86]Okay.
[132:16.10]I didn't take into account the one on the left counting down.
[132:18.47]I thought I had another second.
[132:40.26]Oh shit.
[132:47.24]29.
[132:48.81]Yay!
[132:51.35]The edible just kicked in.
[132:52.87]Dude, you need peanut butter.
[132:57.96]No, actually that'd be messy.
[132:59.08]No, I don't want that.
[133:18.33]Easy.
[133:20.57]Yeah!
[133:50.29]Oh, somebody electrocuted me in my chair.
[133:59.19]Who did the channel points to do that?
[134:01.69]Oh my goodness.
[134:04.43]Dude, who had the million channel points?
[134:07.25]What the heck?
[134:09.87]Oh my God.
[134:10.91]That hurt.
[134:12.35]Dude.
[134:24.60]How do I get those faster?
[135:04.07]Whoa!
[135:04.91]What?
[135:05.45]I was in the thing!
[135:06.59]Okay, I got the thing.
[135:08.13]Goodness.
[135:26.36]Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
[135:32.54]What's this?
[135:33.34]Find the hidden green gem in another level.
[135:35.14]Okay.
[135:35.40]What is that here?
[136:07.34]That's why!
[136:07.94]Where did that just go?
[136:15.90]Where did that go, though?
[136:16.62]I think that went that way.
[136:18.22]Did I miss something?
[136:26.15]I think I missed it.
[136:27.25]Right?
[136:34.06]It looked like there was something over there.
[136:35.34]Guess not.
[136:59.02]What was the point of that?
[137:02.06]What was the point of that?
[137:09.59]What do I do with the mangoes?
[137:12.03]Whatever these are.
[137:18.06]Dude, come on.
[137:18.98]I didn't mean to press the... I didn't mean to press that stupid button.
[137:23.32]Stupid button!
[137:25.64]Alright, speed it up.
[138:12.57]Oh shit.
[138:24.01]Is this the sauce guy?
[138:28.01]One of my things.
[138:52.33]Still got it, alright.
[139:09.40]Come on, you didn't hit it?
[139:10.20]Oh, this is bad.
[139:55.46]There we go.
[139:56.14]It didn't happen last time.
[139:57.52]Why?
[140:06.22]Yes!
[140:09.14]Boss time?
[140:14.75]I missed a lot.
[140:15.77]Sorry.
[140:16.67]Oh, shit.
[140:21.97]Okay, you don't... You don't drive into it.
[140:35.18]Okay, so now what?
[140:42.94]Crash into it?
[140:50.33]Yep.
[141:03.37]Oh, what?
[141:16.85]That was not bad.
[141:21.50]How did I miss that stupid thing?
[141:23.46]How do I leave?
[141:23.96]Exit game.
[141:26.28]Fine.
[141:31.52]I like this game.
[141:32.24]This is a fun game.
[141:33.20]Cool.
[141:45.39]Oh good, you're awake.
[141:49.55]Alright, two masks down, two to go.
[141:52.01]Feeling a little less panicked.
[141:53.53]I wasn't a 10 before, now I'm at a solid, let's say 9.78, 880.
[141:57.05]Oh yeah, these bandicoots are here to help.
[142:01.69]Bandicoot, follow.
[142:06.78]Short and to the point.
[142:08.12]Love this guy.
[142:25.11]Why am I so stretched?
[142:29.98]You guys... Alright.
[142:34.88]Are you guys ready?
[142:40.23]You can't see it.
[142:42.37]It's time.
[142:42.73]Are we going to play Gotham?
[142:43.55]Let's do Gotham Knights.
[142:45.79]It's time to do the sponsor segment of today's broadcast.
[142:50.37]Let's go.
[142:56.09]I'm going to pee.
[142:57.19]I'll come right back.
[142:58.39]I'm going to get started.
[142:59.99]And I'm going to play Gotham Knights.
[143:02.20]And I'm going to play as Nightwing.
[143:07.60]And I am going to.
[143:08.54]It's going to be sick.
[143:15.13]Alright, I'll be back.
[143:17.75]Give me two minutes.
