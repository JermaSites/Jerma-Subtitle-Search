[00:01.44]Oh, look who it is.
[00:03.36]It's Twitch Chat!
[00:04.96]Hi guys.
[00:10.39]Uh, hold on, I gotta move my mic.
[00:12.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:29.66]Hey, thank you for waiting.
[00:30.38]Your patience is unmatched, everybody.
[00:35.56]Will I be watching green screen edits?
[00:37.56]No.
[00:37.76]I want to make sure I make this very clear.
[00:40.88]Very, very clear.
[00:44.10]Green screen edits are going to be only designated for the green screen movie night.
[00:52.08]There might be more than two.
[00:53.35]I might have to do more than three.
[00:57.54]But, we're not gonna watch him on stream, we're not gonna watch him after the stream.
[01:01.56]We're gonna get a good, clean, dedicated movie night.
[01:11.33]Not even one?
[01:11.95]Not even one.
[01:13.61]Oh, we gotta hold on to him.
[01:15.77]That's the specific reason why we did it in the first place.
[01:20.16]Is to have, like, a big movie night, so...
[01:26.86]This is a little too loud, ain't it?
[01:33.48]Mr. Birdman is a little loud.
[01:35.53]Am I sick?
[01:36.77]I was a little stuffy this morning, but I'm good.
[01:42.57]It should clear out here in a minute, so... What do I think of Fallout 76?
[01:49.19]I haven't played Fallout 76.
[01:57.37]I heard it's not good, though.
[02:01.03]I've heard it is very, very, very much a broken video game.
[02:05.54]I don't really have any intention to play it.
[02:08.30]Not really.
[02:12.70]That's an understatement.
[02:13.72]Yeah, I just don't... I didn't even attempt to play it.
[02:17.39]But the thing that we're going to attempt to play tonight is something that...
[02:22.68]We've been talking about it for a couple weeks now.
[02:24.84]And I knew at some point I wanted to play it, so... We're gonna do it tonight.
[02:30.16]And I know that this schedule has been so odd.
[02:33.55]I've been streaming a lot more frequently, but it's probably gonna stay like this.
[02:37.57]I have not yet decided on how the hell I'm gonna... What the new schedule will be.
[02:44.20]I don't know.
[02:54.65]I mean, maybe we'll never stop streaming.
[02:57.69]Like Monday to Monday.
[03:08.16]I'm kidding.
[03:08.62]That's not going to happen.
[03:10.58]Yeah, if you don't... I played Undertale on stream a long time ago.
[03:17.67]And I thought it was fun.
[03:19.51]I hope if you want to stick around and watch this, this is just kind of an extra stream that I knew I wanted to do.
[03:27.98]If you don't want to know, if it's spoilers and all that shit and you don't care, then see you soon.
[03:33.80]Thanks for stopping by.
[03:36.10]So, uh... Let's get it on the screen.
[03:41.80]It's kind of odd to capture because it just, like, starts.
[03:46.32]It's just... It just starts.
[03:48.74]So... I gotta turn this off.
[03:53.04]And we're gonna go.
[03:53.70]It's a three-hour game.
[03:58.46]Well, it... I don't even know... Is it?
[04:03.22]Here comes a three-hour stream.
[04:06.02]No, don't worry, I'm gonna like really, I'm gonna really drag this out.
[04:09.76]Every opportunity that I can stop and make like a 30-minute converse, no, I'm kidding.
[04:16.47]Okay.
[04:20.29]It's got a weird name too.
[04:22.55]Like, your computer thinks it's a virus, right?
[04:24.55]This is not a virus, right?
[04:25.77]Is this his way to make a big joke out of this?
[04:30.66]Alright, here it comes.
[04:33.85]It should show up on the screen very shortly here.
[04:38.59]Any second now.
[04:39.61]There it is.
[04:40.15]Hey, are you there?
[04:42.49]Welcome to Undertale 2.
[04:46.99]Are we connected?
[04:54.52]I remember that.
[04:56.10]That's the heart.
[04:59.20]Excellent.
[05:01.27]Truly excellent.
[05:03.17]This is 18 years in the making, by the way.
[05:06.23]He started this when he was one.
[05:08.85]He started coding this when he was like, I think, four and a half months old.
[05:12.78]We may begin.
[05:21.52]First, you must create a vessel.
[05:28.16]Select the head that you prefer.
[05:40.54]No, I thought up this is more like me right is that more like me I've got like a long skinny chin and The hair that comes down that's like hair going over going down and that's like a long chin.
[05:53.33]Oh
[06:01.85]Select the torso that you prefer.
[06:03.27]Can you also customize killstreaks?
[06:11.61]Well, I don't understand.
[06:12.45]Alright, well, I'm just making Charlie Brown.
[06:18.00]Select the legs that you prefer.
[06:19.68]Is it the same thing?
[06:27.60]What's the difference?
[06:28.22]A fat left leg or a fat right leg?
[06:34.94]I'm just gonna go with this one.
[06:39.13]This is your body.
[06:42.79]Do you accept it?
[06:45.83]Sure.
[06:48.61]Excellent.
[06:50.87]You have created a wonderful form.
[06:55.99]Now, let us shape its mind as your own.
[07:02.67]Where the hell is Sans, man?
[07:04.06]I don't even like this!
[07:05.32]What is its favorite food?
[07:07.08]Sweet, soft, sour, salty.
[07:08.42]Sans!
[07:08.84]Where's Sans?
[07:10.22]Uh, pain.
[07:11.30]Cold.
[07:16.97]No, my favorite food- I'm doing this as if it's me, okay?
[07:21.75]And whatever one is the closest to Sans is the one I'm gonna pick.
[07:24.83]I don't- I think I'm a salt kind of person.
[07:26.51]Salty.
[07:28.39]Sansy, you know?
[07:29.93]Your favorite blood type?
[07:33.52]Uh, D is not a blood type.
[07:35.96]That's like the funny answer.
[07:38.82]Or is that O?
[07:39.38]Is that O?
[07:42.58]I don't even know what my blood type is.
[07:50.51]What is my blood type?
[07:55.21]There's no blood type C. That's D, but that's not an O. Look at the O's up there.
[08:00.63]Look up under, see blood?
[08:05.96]I think I'm a dual blood citizen.
[08:10.82]What color does it like most?
[08:12.83]Red, blue, blue or green?
[08:16.57]That's a tough one.
[08:17.23]This is actually hard.
[08:22.21]Because these are my two favorite colors.
[08:33.91]Am I determining how much HP I have by doing this?
[08:36.11]And how many intellect and mystic points I get or something?
[08:40.51]It's gonna be... I painted my office green.
[08:44.31]It has to be green.
[08:45.87]It's blue.
[08:46.63]Can I go back?
[08:47.59]Please give it a gift.
[08:48.64]Kindness, mind, ambition, bravery, voice.
[08:51.76]Because you know I got that one.
[08:54.12]How do you feel about your creation?
[08:55.74]It will not hear.
[08:57.60]Well, I've got to tell you, I think it has a little bit of hope from that first game.
[09:05.14]Remember that one?
[09:06.14]The Termination.
[09:07.24]Where's that one?
[09:08.44]Where's Sans?
[09:09.20]Where's Sans?
[09:12.02]How do I feel about your creation?
[09:13.34]I'm kind of afraid of it.
[09:15.43]I don't know what it is.
[09:16.75]I don't know.
[09:17.51]It might jump at the screen.
[09:19.29]Have you answered honestly?
[09:23.95]Yes.
[09:24.73]Yes, I have.
[09:27.29]Nice Peter Griffin voice.
[09:29.63]Oh, Lois.
[09:30.61]Lois.
[09:31.87]You acknowledge the possibility of pain and seizure.
[09:35.31]What?
[09:38.71]No?
[09:43.20]I have to acknowledge the fact that it's going to make... Pain and seizure.
[09:47.04]Is this telling me that it's going to be flashy?
[09:51.64]No.
[09:53.18]Understood.
[09:56.86]Name your vessel.
[09:59.68]Uh, me.
[10:03.13]Whoops.
[10:03.47]It's me.
[10:26.89]Who made it?
[10:39.65]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:40.97]I did.
[10:42.79]I made this.
[10:56.95]Excellent.
[10:58.06]Alright.
[10:59.34]Truly excellent.
[11:06.42]Thank you.
[11:08.14]I did this.
[11:09.40]Me.
[11:10.64]I. Your answers.
[11:12.84]Your wonderful creation.
[11:15.22]Uh oh.
[11:17.89]Will now be discarded.
[11:21.23]No one can choose who they are in this world.
[11:25.89]Your name is... Chris.
[11:37.56]Sans.
[11:39.02]Uh, what's, how do I... Chris, Chris, if you do not wake up, we'll be late for school, Chris.
[11:45.94]Oh, that's, uh, that's Abigail.
[11:48.99]I will wait outside for you, all right?
[11:59.87]Okay.
[12:03.55]I got my Legend of Zelda.
[12:05.99]The drawer is mostly empty, except for a school cross-country cert.
[12:11.23]With a tear in it.
[12:12.29]A tear.
[12:12.65]Okay, so am I, like, in high school or something?
[12:15.90]Clothes drawer.
[12:17.48]It's a beautiful day outside.
[12:22.00]There are CDs under the bed.
[12:23.28]Classical, jazz, religious, ska.
[12:25.92]There's also a game console that has one normal controller and one knock-off one.
[12:31.02]This definitely takes place in the 90s.
[12:34.28]It's a computer desk.
[12:35.28]There are many boxes under it filled with old books.
[12:41.33]Okay, what about the bird?
[12:44.87]It's a red wagon with a rusty birdcage in it.
[12:47.42]Looks like it's seen quite a few crashes.
[12:51.02]Why do you have a birdcage?
[12:54.26]A wagon.
[12:55.24]There's a wagon in here.
[12:59.69]A cactus.
[13:00.29]There's not much to say about it.
[13:03.09]There are crayons in the drawer.
[13:04.53]Their labels have long faded and there's no green.
[13:07.48]Just like the 90s.
[13:08.74]It's only you.
[13:11.98]The door is locked.
[13:17.78]Okay.
[13:18.36]Bookshelf.
[13:19.50]There are many books.
[13:20.96]Tales of snails.
[13:21.98]A storybook.
[13:24.37]snails do not have tails a scientific refutation can snails help your garden not really an assigned copy of the history of humans and monsters by gerson boom that new character there everyone's gonna fall in love with wait what about that's it
[13:48.85]You looked inside the sink cupboard.
[13:50.23]There's... a can of Icy's Cool Boys Body Spray.
[13:53.89]Spray for the boys.
[13:55.29]Flamin' hot pizza flavor.
[13:57.29]It seems to be almost entirely full.
[14:02.75]That's good.
[14:03.63]Eh, yep!
[14:04.41]Toby, you already got me!
[14:06.69]It's a toilet.
[14:07.27]Flush it.
[14:14.54]You flushed the toilet.
[14:31.02]Chris, is everything alright in there?
[14:34.18]Yeah!
[14:36.40]Yeah!
[14:45.73]I'm gonna be the first person that finds the secret with the toilet.
[14:51.25]Sands is gonna come out of there.
[14:54.41]Chris, what are you doing in there?
[14:57.13]You did not put a bath bomb in the toilet again, did you?
[15:00.86]I can't wait until Sans comes out here and he goes, I can't wait until he does that.
[15:14.05]On the shower ledge, there's a small container of apple-scented shampoo.
[15:20.55]And a gallon-sized container of pet shampoo.
[15:27.76]Alright, can I leave the bathroom?
[15:30.08]Wait.
[15:32.26]What if I say no?
[15:34.73]It's good to conserve water.
[15:36.09]Oh.
[15:37.61]Whoops.
[15:42.89]There's a photo on the fridge.
[15:44.09]It's of you, your mother, and your brother.
[15:47.41]Okay, so I have a brother.
[15:49.83]Is my brother going to be the guy from the first game?
[15:55.15]Oh, by the way, I think this is a sequel to Undertale.
[15:56.87]I don't know.
[15:58.02]It might be.
[16:00.14]Admitting a pleasant floral scent.
[16:04.62]Cookie cutters for gingerbread monsters and gingerbread humans.
[16:09.39]Cinnamony batter caked on... There's a cinnamony batter caked on the stove top.
[16:16.17]There's some white fur stuck in the drain.
[16:18.57]You gotta look at everything.
[16:21.20]It's a landline phone, but you already have a cell phone.
[16:27.06]It's a chariole, the beloved living room chair.
[16:31.84]Alright, TV.
[16:33.87]Alright, I hope this is like GTA.
[16:35.78]GTA.
[16:36.90]And there's like a shitload of TV channels.
[16:38.50]It's the TV doesn't seem to even be plugged in anymore.
[16:41.74]Oh.
[16:48.88]Chris, there you are.
[16:49.90]We might still be able to make it.
[16:51.10]Here comes the first song!
[16:54.00]It's a beautiful day today, is it not?
[16:57.23]I hope it stays this way when we, when Asriel visits next week.
[17:02.19]But I wonder, after the excitement of university, will he still enjoy coming home to this little town of Undertale?
[17:13.89]I remember those cats.
[17:16.43]I remember that girl from the Muppets.
[17:19.51]In the Electric Boogaloo Band, whatever it's called.
[17:21.51]No, Doctor T in the Electric Mayhem.
[17:37.33]going to school I'm late so does everyone have a
[17:58.01]Oh, Chris, we thought you weren't coming today.
[17:59.89]No, I know this person.
[18:03.43]We're doing group projects this month.
[18:05.49]Oh, so walk around and find a partner, okay?
[18:08.25]The snake!
[18:30.87]Chris, you know, Jockington and Caddy are always partners.
[18:35.01]We're the ultimate academic duo, ever since our first gym class.
[18:39.07]It was hula hoop day, and they ran out of hoops for us.
[18:42.11]So she used me instead.
[18:43.97]That's our origin story.
[18:48.70]Partner?
[18:49.30]I hardly know her.
[18:49.96]What do you think of that one?
[18:53.32]Funny, right?
[18:54.76]No?
[18:55.52]Well, I got news for you, pal.
[18:57.04]I already got a partner.
[19:04.10]Oh, I'm not doing this one.
[19:09.65]I'm not doing this one.
[19:23.02]Chris, I'm very sorry.
[19:25.56]Tim already helped.
[19:26.42]No!
[19:26.90]I'm not doing it.
[19:27.72]Your leg.
[19:32.68]Black and white hard-boiled egg.
[19:34.77]Sadly seems like it already has a partner.
[19:37.65]What about Falco?
[19:40.29]Oh, Chris lit again, I see.
[19:41.43]You need a partner?
[19:43.23]Sorry, I'm already partners with the second smartest student.
[19:46.67]Oh, wait.
[19:47.41]Chris, now that I think about it, your unique skill set might help a lot on this assignment.
[19:53.26]What?
[19:53.76]I actually wanted to get an A. All right, easy.
[19:57.14]Settle down here, daffy duck.
[20:00.46]Hey, Chris, what's up?
[20:01.24]Did you lose your pencil again?
[20:03.14]Here, you want the candy cane one or the one with the lights on it?
[20:06.02]Huh?
[20:06.18]You want to be partners?
[20:09.26]Birdly already asked me, but I could ask Ms.
[20:11.88]Alphys if we could make a group of three.
[20:15.07]I'll ask if you're sure.
[20:16.37]Not yet.
[20:16.83]I'm not going to be the third partner here.
[20:21.67]What about Cat Sip from Final Fantasy VII?
[20:25.53]Click, click, tap, tap.
[20:27.31]Take him.
[20:31.97]I can't, I have to, okay, I have to let go, ask her for this.
[20:36.67]What?
[20:37.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what am I watching on my phone?
[20:39.75]It's schoolwork, of course.
[20:41.69]Animated schoolwork, and... Hey, Chris, have you chosen a partner yet?
[20:45.43]I want to be partners with a snake.
[20:47.51]This is kind of not fair.
[20:50.53]If you can't get anyone, maybe your mom will be your partner again.
[20:56.41]Okay, where is Haymaker?
[21:02.72]No, no, let's be partners.
[21:03.84]Okay, I'll ask.
[21:08.74]Miss Alphys, is it okay if we have a group of three?
[21:10.78]No, I don't want to approve of this.
[21:14.06]Abort.
[21:16.53]Chris doesn't have a... Noelle, what were you saying?
[21:19.61]She was just saying, refine me alone.
[21:22.65]Actually, I just wanted to know if... Noelle, can you please speak up?
[21:25.89]Uh-oh.
[21:29.56]Hi, five-fivey.
[21:31.98]Five-oo-fivey.
[21:41.29]Oh, no, no, you're fine.
[21:42.05]We were just, uh, choosing partners for the next group project, and, uh, fivey-fivey, you're with Chris.
[21:50.72]Great.
[21:57.32]Now that everyone's here, I'll write the assignment down.
[22:07.51]Has anyone seen the chalk?
[22:10.01]This is the third time it's gone missing, and you all know I can't start class without some chalk.
[22:17.19]How about this?
[22:17.83]If no one speaks up, everyone gets in trouble.
[22:24.47]Anyone, please?
[22:25.88]This dude just sucks.
[22:28.22]Hey, there might be a box in the supply closet.
[22:30.04]Miss Alphys, why don't you just, uh... Oh, 5u5y and I.
[22:36.60]Good idea, Noelle.
[22:38.54]Since you came in last, Fivey, why don't you go and get it for me?
[22:47.66]Whatever.
[22:52.49]You can't keep this up, I know.
[22:56.23]And Chris, can you go with her and make sure she actually gets it and stays out of trouble?
[23:02.69]Thanks, Chris.
[23:03.99]See you later.
[23:14.79]Eating the chalk?
[23:16.05]What are you doing?
[23:19.87]Whose footprints are these?
[23:23.01]Chris.
[23:24.83]Didn't see you there.
[23:27.78]Hey.
[23:30.20]You didn't see anything just now, did you?
[23:34.78]Huh.
[23:39.59]You can't even say?
[23:47.28]Chris.
[23:49.72]I can't get in there.
[23:50.46]I have to go around my pop filter.
[23:55.88]Hey.
[23:59.26]Let me tell you a secret.
[24:03.17]Oh!
[24:07.31]Quiet people piss me off.
[24:11.43]I think just because you don't say anything, I can't tell exactly what you're thinking.
[24:15.06]It's over!
[24:17.16]I caught 5e5e eating all the chalk.
[24:21.08]This was her last chance.
[24:23.22]Now she'll finally be expelled.
[24:27.74]Come on, Chris.
[24:28.39]Don't act shocked.
[24:29.11]You know it's true.
[24:31.71]Everyone's waiting for it.
[24:33.29]Everyone wants to see this happen.
[24:35.31]Why am I pulling these back?
[24:36.91]So congrats, Chris.
[24:38.33]You got me.
[24:38.81]I'm done for.
[24:43.29]They say, one little thing seems like a waste to get expelled just for having a snack.
[24:48.53]So Chris, if I know you're gonna pull the trigger, why don't I just get expelled for some real carnage?
[24:56.23]Chris, how do you feel?
[24:57.57]About losing your face?
[25:09.06]Nah.
[25:12.52]Chris, you got a good mother.
[25:13.32]It would be a shame to make her bury her child.
[25:16.43]What the fuck is happening?
[25:17.49]Alright, let's get this over with.
[25:20.17]We'll get more chalk.
[25:21.49]Mosey back to class, and then Chris, you'll do our project.
[25:24.97]How's that sound?
[25:27.80]What happened?
[25:28.50]What?
[25:29.28]Don't bother answering.
[25:30.06]If you haven't gotten it by now, your choices don't matter.
[25:36.34]Let's go, freak.
[25:39.01]At least you're honest.
[25:42.88]The locker is covered in Jockington memorabilia.
[25:45.82]Memorabilia.
[25:47.62]Locked.
[25:48.95]Locked.
[25:49.85]Locker's lock is locked.
[25:51.81]The lock's locker is locked.
[25:54.57]The locker's lock's locker is locked.
[25:59.75]Alright.
[26:02.96]Are you ready for the Sadie Hawkins... Hawkman's... Sadie Hawkman's dance?
[26:09.70]At this dance, all chaperones will wear giant hawk heads and screech at any students that make contact.
[26:22.16]God, can you walk any slower or what?
[26:24.60]Nah, I get it.
[26:26.46]Not used to walking around without someone holding your hand.
[26:31.20]Come on, freak.
[26:31.97]This is, like, bad.
[26:38.12]Well, here's the closet.
[26:39.06]Too bad.
[26:39.62]We were just starting to have fun.
[26:44.62]What the hell is happening?
[26:49.72]Hey, Chris, is it me, or... Is it really dark in there?
[26:57.28]Hold up, Chris.
[26:57.88]Are you gonna go in, or what?
[27:05.56]Fine, if you're gonna be a wimp, then I'll...
[27:10.45]We're both going at the same time.
[27:16.53]See, why are you so scared?
[27:18.17]There's nothing in here but old papers.
[27:20.91]Let's try to find a light switch.
[27:23.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:26.40]That's weird.
[27:27.22]I can't find a switch.
[27:28.92]Guess it's further in.
[27:33.90]Uh, kind of big for a closet, huh?
[27:35.60]You'd think we'd have reached the end by now.
[27:37.68]Is this a surprise birthday party?
[27:42.55]Hey, Chris.
[27:42.91]I think this closet's broken.
[27:46.03]There aren't any walls.
[27:48.57]Well, we've worked hard enough.
[27:49.59]If Alphys wants chalk so bad, she can get it herself.
[27:53.34]Let's split.
[28:01.36]What the... Hey, this isn't funny.
[28:03.83]Let us out.
[28:04.23]Let us out.
[28:10.52]Here he comes!
[28:14.89]The floor, it's... Did I not play Undertale?
[28:29.89]I played, yeah, I played through Undertale, like, fucking five times, dude.
[28:41.29]Wait, what happened?
[28:50.30]Am I a different... am I the same character?
[28:55.62]At times you see it flickering, the light only you can see.
[28:58.84]By second nature you reach out and... Save the game.
[29:03.62]I made this.
[29:06.66]I found the run button.
[29:07.60]Yeah, I did.
[29:17.51]Cool.
[29:17.79]You're not gonna move?
[29:19.77]Yes, you are.
[29:20.25]It's really an interesting tidbit about this game.
[29:29.19]Toby made the whole thing in Game Boy Camera.
[29:31.29]Which is, like, just... I don't even know how he did that.
[29:42.96]It's too dark to see anything.
[29:47.05]I thought, well, I mean, I did.
[29:49.71]You thought I made, yeah, well, I mean.
[29:53.45]I saw a figure.
[30:00.26]A blob that seems to be able to move.
[30:02.74]It's too dark to see anything.
[30:04.02]One of these is going to have some kind of item in it, right?
[30:05.98]It has to.
[30:07.06]It's too dark to
[30:13.72]Alright, that's creepy.
[30:15.78]Right?
[30:16.22]Like, come on.
[30:17.88]That's just weird.
[30:18.94]It's too dark to see anything.
[30:19.94]Let's go down.
[30:24.60]Ah, item.
[30:28.26]There's something glowing inside.
[30:29.90]Take it.
[30:30.76]Yes.
[30:31.76]You got the Glow Shard.
[30:33.06]Can I see what it is?
[30:38.40]No, don't toss it.
[30:40.80]I have a cell phone.
[30:42.78]Glow shard.
[30:44.12]A shimmering shard?
[30:45.02]Its use is unknown.
[30:49.89]Equip.
[30:51.49]I have a wood blade.
[30:53.61]Nothing.
[30:54.07]Nothing.
[30:54.57]No weapons.
[30:57.19]Power.
[30:58.45]Level 1 human.
[31:00.49]Body contains a human soul.
[31:03.07]Spells.
[31:04.09]Guts.
[31:04.63]Magic defense.
[31:07.19]Then we have a config file.
[31:12.81]Uh, I think this is... Full screen.
[31:15.21]Hold on a second here.
[31:19.97]Alright.
[31:21.19]That's pretty good, actually, because now I can do this.
[31:22.95]I was running it in a window this whole time because there's no way to... Uh, is this going to work?
[31:35.72]There we go.
[31:36.52]That looks so much better.
[31:38.58]Cool.
[31:41.28]Nice, alright.
[31:41.94]So now we are actually in full screen.
[31:44.42]You press Alt-Enter?
[31:45.89]I didn't really think about it.
[31:47.53]Alright, let's go.
[31:51.27]That's a lot better now.
[31:52.13]I can actually see everything.
[31:53.11]Alright, so there's a figure going this way.
[31:58.01]We're going to go this way.
[32:00.37]That one's red.
[32:00.91]It's going to shoot a laser beam.
[32:03.21]Yep.
[32:08.89]Come on.
[32:09.87]I've got Platinum God and Binding of Isaac.
[32:12.49]You really think I'm gonna get hit by that?
[32:15.11]What are you talking about?
[32:16.13]You bathe your body in the light.
[32:18.27]Power shines within you, breaking through the darkness.
[32:22.02]Any pain you may have had melted away, HP fully restored.
[32:24.46]And a save point.
[32:29.84]In this land, only eyes blinded by darkness can see the way.
[32:32.86]Okay.
[32:38.02]So we've got, uh, that's the two.
[32:41.42]And, oh, we got a... They all have to be dark.
[32:45.29]So... That's it.
[32:50.27]Eyes blind.
[32:50.95]Darkness is the way, right?
[32:58.27]That's like 2,000 hours in Binding of Isaac.
[33:01.82]I've stepped on the cubes that you need to step on to open the door in a certain order.
[33:05.20]Come here.
[33:05.60]Come on, man.
[33:16.70]Should I talk to these guys?
[33:18.98]Ooh, they just explode.
[33:24.19]I'm really- I'm actually pretty good at this because, I mean, I like- I have about two, three thousand hours in Binding of Isaac, and when you- I always check all the poops for coins and everything, you know what I mean?
[33:32.37]So.
[33:35.33]Hey, back off!
[33:36.01]Come any closer and I'll... Chris, phew.
[33:41.59]Hey, don't scare me like that, dumbass.
[33:44.25]Unless you want to get clocked in the face.
[33:46.95]Heh.
[33:47.91]Anyway, enough screwing around.
[33:49.33]We gotta find a way out of here.
[33:53.84]Uh, where is here, anyway?
[33:56.66]Doesn't matter.
[33:57.38]You got us into this mess.
[33:58.42]You get us out of here.
[34:01.52]Lead the way, Chris.
[34:02.49]Are there party members?
[34:04.69]This is fairly new.
[34:06.93]I mean, it is new.
[34:08.09]Because... Oh my god, never mind.
[34:10.03]You walk way too slow.
[34:11.17]I was just sprinting.
[34:12.05]What?
[34:13.57]I was just going as fast as I could warm up.
[34:21.17]Okay.
[34:26.00]Hey Chris, there's someone up there waving at us.
[34:28.64]Any idea what they want?
[34:31.22]Here he is!
[34:31.66]He's gonna be here!
[34:32.46]I can't believe it!
[34:33.00]Run!
[34:33.14]What are you talking about, guy?
[34:42.69]Oh wow, like Mega Satan, huh?
[34:45.81]I have plenty of training.
[34:49.54]I beat Mega Satan with fucking The Lost.
[34:51.14]I didn't get hit one time.
[35:06.62]End up... Down here, quick!
[35:15.43]I didn't even know what it wanted me to do.
[35:22.60]I didn't even get to see the tutorial.
[35:23.66]Alright, if I can hit one fucking time, I'm gonna go in the dryer and have somebody turn it on.
[35:42.71]Oh my god, he's so weird.
[35:54.68]I wonder if there's any in that building up there.
[35:59.63]Weird flecks, what?
[36:02.41]Let me check, can I open these doors?
[36:08.15]It looks like a shop, but the door is locked and no one's inside.
[36:10.83]I'm so weird and quirky.
[36:15.61]It's locked.
[36:21.16]Quirky.
[36:22.44]I hate that word.
[36:24.40]That word is worse than mayonnaise.
[36:33.92]Yeah, I'll save it, I guess.
[36:52.04]Okay.
[36:52.20]We're going straight in.
[36:59.26]A castle.
[37:00.26]Why the hell is there a castle inside a supply closet?
[37:04.91]Welcome, humans.
[37:07.47]Do not be alarmed.
[37:08.91]I am not your enemy.
[37:10.65]Please, come forward, both of you, at the same time.
[37:18.98]Welcome.
[37:19.74]I am the prince of this kingdom.
[37:21.78]The kingdom of darkness.
[37:23.92]Chris.
[37:24.46]Susie.
[37:25.52]Oh, sorry.
[37:26.26]Five-O-Fivey.
[37:27.48]There's a legend in this land.
[37:28.99]A legend that one day, two heroes of light will arrive and fulfill the ancient prophecy foretold by time and space.
[37:36.37]Please, heroes, listen to my tale.
[37:41.16]Very well.
[37:46.85]Once upon a time, a legend was whispered among shadows.
[37:53.60]It was a legend of hope.
[37:55.34]It was a legend of dreams.
[37:57.50]It was a legend of light and darkness.
[38:01.28]This is the legend of Deltarune.
[38:10.09]For millennia, light and dark have lived in balance, bringing peace to the world.
[38:18.19]But if this harmony were to shatter, a terrible calamity would occur on this world.
[38:27.98]The sky will run black with the terror, and the land will crack with fear.
[38:36.88]Then, her heart pounding, the earth will draw her final breath.
[38:46.38]Only then shining with hope, three heroes appear at world's edge.
[38:53.70]Sans, Papyrus, and you, a human, a monster, and a prince from the dark, me, Sans.
[39:05.02]Only they can see to the fountains.
[39:08.56]Thank you for playing the Delta Rune demo and banish the angel's heaven.
[39:14.14]Only then will balance be restored.
[39:18.43]and the world saved from destruction.
[39:23.03]Today, the Fountain of Darkness, the geyser that gives this land form, stands tall at the center of the kingdom.
[39:38.04]But recently, another fountain has appeared on the horizon.
[39:43.59]It's over there.
[39:44.81]And with it, the balance of light and dark begins to shift.
[39:56.18]So, Chris, thank you for listening to my long tale.
[40:02.25]I deeply believe you two are the heroes of the legend.
[40:05.49]That despite whatever enemies you may face, you two have the courage to save the world.
[40:11.63]Delta Warriors, please won't you accept your destiny?
[40:17.44]Uh, no.
[40:19.04]Wait, what?
[40:21.17]Me, some kind of hero or something?
[40:22.47]No way, not me.
[40:23.95]You've got the wrong person.
[40:25.95]But, but, but, without you, the world is... So what?
[40:31.29]If the world gets destroyed, I don't care.
[40:32.40]It's none of my damn business.
[40:34.76]Might even be kind of fun.
[40:38.40]Anyway, Chris, if you want to play pretend with this weirdo, stick around.
[40:43.48]I'm going to find a way out of here.
[40:44.90]Fine with me, wait.
[40:53.87]Oh, wait.
[40:57.55]The heroes are already running away!
[40:59.63]And they didn't even know I was here!
[41:00.87]My dad's gonna make me son of the month!
[41:05.40]Who the hell are you?
[41:08.46]I'm... the bad guy!
[41:12.18]You clowns want to steal our dark fountain, huh?
[41:15.30]I'm still picturing you guys as clowns!
[41:17.70]Save the world from eternal darkness, huh?
[41:22.39]Don't try and deny it.
[41:23.69]We both know you'll go east.
[41:25.83]It's your only way home.
[41:27.15]But I, Lancer, won't let you go there.
[41:31.18]And I've got a flawless two-step plan to ensure it.
[41:34.40]Step one, I thrash you.
[41:36.58]Step two, you lose.
[41:37.74]Nice plan, kid.
[41:42.06]Really?
[41:43.62]Actually, it's a pretty good plan.
[41:44.68]Mind if we use it on you instead?
[41:50.87]This isn't, this isn't an actual full-on RPG.
[41:57.85]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Wade, Wade, whoa, whoa, what was that?
[42:06.95]Interesting, okay.
[42:13.40]So you have to time, it's timed hits.
[42:15.66]Okay, cool.
[42:17.32]And then when you...
[42:21.23]All right, this is cool, this is like just that's really that's actually pretty cool What can I do check good morning you tell lancer to watch out for susie's attack he readies himself So, what are you guys gonna do what are you guys doing after this
[42:48.60]Lancer's motorcycle is actually just a bike that's on fire.
[42:56.03]That was confident.
[42:57.33]You tell Lancer you can't tell the difference between his clothes and his body.
[43:00.75]He seems flattered.
[43:01.65]His attack power went down.
[43:05.89]Oh, you make my feelings do wheelies.
[43:07.64]Sweet wheelies.
[43:08.36]Ooh, I'm getting hit.
[43:14.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[43:15.40]My bike's running out of fuel.
[43:16.90]Alright, you punkaroos.
[43:18.46]You had the luck of the draw this time.
[43:20.30]Next time, the losers will be you.
[43:23.37]What does that say?
[43:24.91]I don't know what that means.
[43:26.49]Bye, losers.
[43:27.39]I gotta get home before dinner.
[43:28.41]39 D money.
[43:36.31]Oh, it's a dryer run.
[43:38.32]Oh, shit.
[43:39.70]I gotta go in there.
[43:42.18]Are you two okay?
[43:44.21]Um... Allow me to introduce myself more properly.
[43:47.70]I am... Take off the hood.
[43:53.10]I can barely hear you.
[43:55.68]Oh, alright.
[44:01.08]Oh.
[44:08.51]Well, I don't even, like, I didn't even... I don't care if Sans is in the game.
[44:13.28]I don't give a shit.
[44:14.84]Why am I pretending to care about that?
[44:19.40]I got, like... I pretended to care about it, like, an hour ago.
[44:23.18]And me... I, like, believed my own pretending.
[44:26.45]I was actually waiting for it.
[44:29.41]Hello, everyone.
[44:29.97]I'm Rousey.
[44:31.07]Chris.
[44:31.55]Susie.
[44:32.37]It's ever so wonderful to meet you.
[44:34.07]I'm certain we're going to become great friends, and... Best way to leave is east, right?
[44:39.35]Yes.
[44:39.84]That's where I will... Got it.
[44:44.06]See you at school, Chris.
[44:50.15]I suppose it's just the two of us, then.
[44:56.15]Chris, I'm a prince, but I currently don't have any subjects.
[45:00.80]I've been waiting alone here my whole life for you two to arrive, so I'm really happy to meet you.
[45:07.48]Hope we can be good friends, Chris.
[45:11.40]Let's try to find Susie.
[45:12.39]She must be to the southeast.
[45:15.60]you can lead the way Chris hey Chris I really think we should go catch up with Susie you can come back here after our adventures over and then I can bake you a yummy cake
[45:38.16]Rousey the Lonely Prince is now your ally.
[45:39.82]The power of fluffy boys shines within you.
[45:43.30]Okay.
[45:56.31]Oh, Chris!
[45:57.08]It's the training dummy I made.
[45:59.34]Now seems like a great chance to prepare for the enemy.
[46:01.12]Would you like me to teach you how to fight?
[46:03.18]Yeah, I just, I want to know.
[46:05.70]I know how to do it, but I just want to be told.
[46:07.30]Because I want to know what the deal is.
[46:09.71]See that heart there, Chris?
[46:10.49]Yep.
[46:11.71]That's your soul, the culmination of your being.
[46:14.31]Within it holds your, well, your compassion and fate of the world.
[46:18.70]If it gets hit, you and your friends will die.
[46:21.62]If everyone's HP reaches zero, then Jerma has to get into a dryer.
[46:25.58]And we'll lose.
[46:26.82]So please take care not to get hit.
[46:28.58]Don't get hit by the enemy's attacks.
[46:29.72]Ready?
[46:29.92]Let's try dodging.
[46:34.86]What?
[46:36.94]Good job, Chris.
[46:37.94]You're a natural.
[46:38.60]Anyhow, after the enemy attacks, it's our turn, Chris.
[46:41.84]First, I'll teach you how to fight.
[46:44.18]The fighting is unnecessary in this world.
[46:45.98]There's no harm in a thorough lesson.
[46:50.15]Is there anything I can do besides this?
[46:52.29]Right, that's it, right?
[46:54.19]Wow, Chris, that was an amazing attack.
[46:56.41]Have you done this before or something?
[46:57.75]Okay, now let's try defending.
[47:00.63]Simply defend, and the enemy's attack will hurt you less.
[47:02.97]Not only that, but you'll also gather TP.
[47:07.07]Watch the orange big bar on the left, it'll explain it next.
[47:13.05]Great.
[47:14.13]Now that we've gathered TP, how about spending that TP on one of my spells?
[47:19.86]Because you hit the enemy enough, it got tired.
[47:22.00]Stop!
[47:23.42]I used my pacify spell on it.
[47:25.90]It'll fall asleep and will win peacefully.
[47:30.08]Alright, magic pacify on the tired dummy.
[47:36.58]Great!
[47:37.16]You would have won the battle by now.
[47:38.88]Now I have just a little more to teach you.
[47:41.50]Acting through this, even though the most violent enemies, can be defeated through various acts of kindness.
[47:50.03]Chris, though, is just a dummy.
[47:50.99]Why not give it a hug?
[47:57.17]I can hug the prince?
[47:59.98]Oh, that's great, Chris.
[48:01.10]Each enemy has different acts that satisfy them.
[48:03.60]When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns yellow.
[48:06.46]When that happens, you can defeat it by sparing it.
[48:08.44]If we spare all the enemies we meet, we'll never have to fight.
[48:18.28]So, is he yellow?
[48:20.10]Not quite.
[48:24.29]You hug Rousey.
[48:26.11]Uh, Chris, uh, I don't think, um, this is what you're supposed to be doing.
[48:30.23]Alright, hug.
[48:37.46]You hug the dummy.
[48:38.68]That's great, Chris.
[48:39.56]Just one hug is enough, though.
[48:41.84]Oh.
[48:42.18]I don't know how to do anything else.
[48:45.76]So that is yellow.
[48:49.45]Well, that was fun.
[48:50.91]You're a wonderful student, Chris.
[48:52.33]And in case you ever need a refresher eye, here, I wrote a manual for you.
[48:55.91]It's just a dummy.
[49:18.35]What, a JoJo reference?
[49:23.95]What does that mean?
[49:25.22]Oh my, the great door is open!
[49:26.72]No wonder Lancer was able to come through.
[49:31.18]Chris, once we pass through this door, our adventure will really begin.
[49:34.28]A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy.
[49:36.54]But Chris, I believe your choices are important too.
[49:40.01]This world is full of all kinds of people, Chris.
[49:42.59]In the end, how we treat them makes all the difference.
[49:45.35]So let's try our best to kill everyone.
[49:48.98]Every person you come across.
[49:50.66]And get the bad ending.
[49:52.16]If we can manage to do that, then chat will be very upset, and I believe this tale may have a very bad ending and a lot of unsubscriptions to your channel.
[50:00.80]Otherwise, I fear that you may get the good ending, and... people will be happy.
[50:07.57]No, I'm sorry.
[50:08.63]Is that too much?
[50:09.15]I can hear you.
[50:13.71]I knew you were here the moment I saw you.
[50:14.97]Let's try our best.
[50:28.69]The Mario demo screen's gonna turn off, the thing that used to be in GameStop.
[50:32.19]Now I gotta let the person behind me play.
[50:33.65]I think reset the Super Nintendo on me.
[50:44.89]With the door closed behind you, your adventure will truly begin.
[50:47.51]Power adventure shines within you.
[50:52.93]46 minutes.
[50:55.28]Oh yeah.
[50:57.65]Oh yeah.
[51:00.07]Let's take the scenery in first.
[51:01.33]I mean, why am I rushing through this?
[51:02.59]This demo is only like three hours long.
[51:07.07]I might as well just look at everything.
[51:13.17]The Field of Hopes and Dreams.
[51:20.85]Enemies ahead.
[51:21.49]You're gonna die.
[51:22.52]Signed, Lancer.
[51:30.65]Ah!
[51:31.19]Uh, Rudin drew near.
[51:38.29]Okay, Rudin drew near.
[51:45.28]I, what?
[51:46.22]He won.
[51:48.00]I didn't have, I didn't have an option.
[51:49.38]I just, did I just kill him?
[51:51.25]I didn't have an option.
[51:54.22]I didn't kill him, I scared him.
[51:58.54]Act?
[52:01.42]Bad ending.
[52:02.38]If you're reading this, I guess you're dead.
[52:04.28]Signed, Lancer.
[52:06.76]I didn't act.
[52:07.32]I will, I... Get away from me with a sword!
[52:11.24]Don't come up to me with a sword!
[52:12.50]Idiot.
[52:22.84]Hey, don't read this sign.
[52:23.88]It's a work in progress.
[52:24.84]Signed, Lancer.
[52:32.48]Ho, ho, ho.
[52:33.10]But is it my two favorite people?
[52:35.08]Sike, you guys aren't even in my top five.
[52:38.42]Lancer, where's Susie?
[52:40.07]You mean that purple girl?
[52:41.57]Ho, ho, ho.
[52:42.29]You fools.
[52:43.11]You're too late to stop me.
[52:45.21]What did you do?
[52:47.03]It was so simple.
[52:48.55]She beat me up, so I ran away.
[52:51.15]That's a bit anticlimactic.
[52:53.91]Is that it?
[52:56.76]Or are you just going to stand there?
[52:57.92]I thought you would at least run to the right.
[53:01.96]Why?
[53:02.06]The purple girl's over there.
[53:03.14]Well, all right.
[53:13.05]I'm going to look down.
[53:17.85]These types of trees don't contain an item that can heal you.
[53:20.21]Whatever you do, don't check the tree and use C to open your menu.
[53:24.11]Got it?
[53:24.63]Signed, Lancer.
[53:25.61]There are two objects hanging from the tree.
[53:29.23]Take one.
[53:31.92]You got the dark candy.
[53:35.44]Wait, what about the other one?
[53:38.74]Take... yeah.
[53:40.26]You got the... okay, there's two.
[53:42.18]There's nothing hanging low enough to take.
[53:50.24]Alright, see you later, weirdo.
[53:51.36]Hey, if you head that way, my troops will trash you.
[53:55.90]Is that a threat?
[53:57.36]I prefer to think of it as an invitation.
[53:58.98]Okay.
[54:03.08]Alright, I'm gonna be nice.
[54:07.00]A necklace of Rudens blocks your path.
[54:09.56]Alright, Ruden up top.
[54:11.80]Let's see, check.
[54:14.22]Let's lecture.
[54:15.26]A necklace of Rudens blocks your path.
[54:21.25]I can only act with, um, Chris.
[54:25.93]You lectured the enemies on the importance of kindness.
[54:28.30]Enemies became tired.
[54:30.76]What?
[54:31.06]Okay.
[54:31.52]Long live the guy who pays us.
[54:36.72]Long live the guy who pays us.
[54:39.86]Rudin is starting to fall asleep.
[54:41.47]Uh, alright.
[54:44.81]Can I... They're not yellow yet.
[54:49.15]Convince.
[54:53.17]He told Rudin to quit fighting.
[54:54.57]It was utterly swayed.
[54:56.47]Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[54:57.49]Face my diamond cutter.
[55:03.15]Hitbox is fairly large, but I guess that's the... Alright, spare.
[55:08.52]Rudin is starting to fall asleep.
[55:09.68]Let's spare... I can only spare the top one.
[55:12.74]Chris spared Rudin.
[55:16.03]Name wasn't yellow.
[55:16.87]Okay.
[55:19.36]Face my Diamond Cutter so you can Pacify.
[55:21.16]But does Pacify just make them more susceptible to... Ow!
[55:28.34]Not yet.
[55:29.00]No.
[55:31.68]Alright, let's Convince.
[55:36.28]Pacify just ends the fight.
[55:39.00]No.
[55:41.31]Wait, did I just hit him?
[55:43.75]I think I hit him.
[55:45.95]Good.
[55:54.42]You missed.
[55:55.70]Alright, starting to fall asleep.
[56:00.04]There you go.
[56:02.03]The only thing that's confusing me is from the first game just having the one menu and having more than one party member is... I'm trying to get used to that.
[56:10.63]See, I spared them.
[56:11.61]They're fine.
[56:12.17]I thought that was him.
[56:25.42]Damn.
[56:28.58]But thank you, uh, thank you Alpine's B for the $100.
[56:31.76]100 bucks from Alpine.
[56:35.09]Thank you.
[56:36.63]Hi Jeremy, I'm donating on behalf of my friend Michael, who passed away recently.
[56:41.89]We've been following since the TF2 days, and you've given us so much joy.
[56:46.05]Thank you for everything.
[56:49.15]Alpine, I'm very sorry to hear about that.
[56:54.32]Thank you so much for the 100 bucks.
[56:59.06]You two have been apparently following since all the way back then.
[57:04.39]I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[57:05.61]Hopefully you give yourself the time necessary to... ...to grieve and... ...and much love and much respect to obviously Michael's family as well, so...
[57:26.71]Take care of yourself.
[57:30.37]And thanks for being around.
[57:46.25]Nothing can take away the memories that you two have, that's true.
[57:50.11]That is very true.
[58:06.51]Why is everyone's messages getting deleted?
[58:08.53]They shouldn't be.
[58:12.68]Let's go here.
[58:17.20]Uh, I'm Top Chef, my latest cake worked me to exhaustion.
[58:22.28]Top Chef.
[58:22.97]Message deleted, what's going on?
[58:27.93]Oh, now you guys are just juggling with me here, okay.
[58:34.45]Uh, Mama Miba, I'm top chef.
[58:36.45]My latest cake worked due to exhaustion, so I took a little nap, but Mama Miba, a scary noise woke me up.
[58:45.72]A beast was hunched on the table, eating the cake like an animal.
[58:49.44]I spritzed it with water and hissed and ran off, but my wonderful cake is... Oh, Chris, that sounds like Susie.
[58:56.30]We must be going the right way.
[58:57.40]Let's try to keep her out of any more trouble.
[59:07.50]I got hold on it's important I got something else to say um I just want to make this uh very clear that anytime I hear about something like this right uh I'm I'm so just
[59:29.65]if you have this channel and you and your friends and or you and your family members or whatever and you guys hang out here and you like this shit and you hang and it's like it means a lot to you it means a lot to me so just knowing that people have fun here and we're
[59:57.53]I think about it a lot so just want to make sure you guys are very clear on that thanks a lot all right let's go back into it uh here is the cake like how why is the cake a like a flying saucer
[60:26.46]Take a piece of cake.
[60:27.46]Yeah, sure.
[60:29.12]The broken cake was added to your key items.
[60:41.91]Is that bad?
[60:42.45]Should I not be doing that?
[60:46.37]What if I talk to him again with the... Can I give him the piece of cake?
[60:49.57]Mama, Meeba, Mama, Mama, Sheba.
[60:52.93]You know that?
[60:53.47]Beast, please don't come back.
[60:56.94]Alright.
[61:01.20]No, no, no!
[61:02.26]Uh-oh.
[61:05.75]Hathy, block the way!
[61:06.85]Alright, Rudin needs to be lectured.
[61:15.93]And... How much magic?
[61:17.87]I don't have any magic, so... We need to defend first.
[61:26.04]The enemies became tired.
[61:28.50]What?
[61:28.82]Okay.
[61:29.36]What is that?
[61:30.80]Why is that just like a Wii U drawing?
[61:32.32]Oh, shit.
[61:34.24]Okay.
[61:37.18]Hathy's beat slows.
[61:40.91]Oh, thank God.
[61:41.75]Not yet.
[61:44.15]Uh, let's convince and then pacify on Hathy.
[61:50.09]You told Rudin to quit fighting.
[61:51.38]It was utterly swayed.
[61:52.40]Rousey cast pacify.
[61:53.92]I guess that makes sense.
[62:01.55]Our party must fall asleep.
[62:05.10]And if you don't do anything... We just had a bunch of community subs.
[62:13.88]Novi gave five community subs.
[62:15.48]Thanks a lot.
[62:18.32]Thank you so much, Novi.
[62:19.92]And congratulations to the people that are getting these community subs.
[62:24.44]Thank you!
[62:25.85]Puzzle time.
[62:28.10]We got a puzzle here.
[62:30.34]Check it out.
[62:31.59]Check the clock.
[62:32.45]In order to solve this puzzle, you'll have to hurry.
[62:34.35]They've got so much time in The Legend of Zelda.
[62:50.99]I beat Star Tropic's first try blind without taking any damage.
[62:58.68]Behold, the maze of death.
[62:59.48]Prepare to get lost, clown.
[63:00.66]Signed, Lancer.
[63:10.09]Uh-oh.
[63:11.17]Failing lost yet?
[63:11.97]You must be utterly helpless among these twists and turns.
[63:14.59]Your sense of direction won't save you now.
[63:16.41]What was that?
[63:18.96]It's some sort of enemy.
[63:20.00]Looks like they got clobbered.
[63:21.32]Oh, I see.
[63:21.68]I'm assuming I have to follow the signs, but I kind of want to see what's over here.
[63:29.89]Oh, Chris, we need to stop Susie quick.
[63:48.99]Hey, wait.
[63:49.49]Where am I?
[63:49.97]Help.
[63:50.23]Somebody help me.
[63:50.77]I'm lost.
[63:52.75]Oh, and there are coins.
[63:55.09]You open the treasure chest.
[63:56.25]Inside was white ribbon.
[63:58.25]You put white ribbon in your armor.
[64:00.69]The ribbon is armor, Chris.
[64:02.61]It increases defense.
[64:04.13]Why don't you try wearing it in the equipment menu?
[64:06.25]Yeah, I will.
[64:06.89]I think it'll look great on you.
[64:13.84]Okay, so this is Chris and we've got white ribbon is Crinkly hair ribbon that slightly increases your defense and cuteness What the fuck does that mean?
[64:24.43]I've hired cuteness
[64:42.49]Oh, no.
[64:42.89]Well, Rousey apparently is cuter now.
[64:45.51]Chris, you're giving it to me?
[64:48.59]Well, does it look pretty?
[64:55.75]I better get that back.
[64:56.57]That's a loan, man.
[64:58.91]I want three ribbons back with interest.
[65:03.19]Hey, don't look.
[65:04.79]This sign's private.
[65:05.77]I already did.
[65:09.83]Oh, it's just this way.
[65:12.72]There he is!
[65:13.24]Ho ho ho!
[65:15.58]Somehow you survived the maze, but don't count on your blessings before they hatch!
[65:19.64]Let's see if you're against this team.
[65:24.12]Uh, triple frogs.
[65:26.27]Three hatties blocked the way.
[65:30.53]So, we can go to Act.
[65:32.59]Let's do Flatter.
[65:34.73]Let's Flatter.
[65:37.23]And let's get some defense here.
[65:39.77]Now, that one up top is... Is that like a Grinch meter?
[65:48.89]I don't understand the Grinch meter.
[65:50.51]Hey, why aren't you guys thrashed?
[65:51.81]You're totally outnumbered.
[65:52.87]And that's, um, unusual somehow?
[65:54.63]Why don't we talk about this after the battle?
[66:10.72]okay uh let me pacify pacify but the enemy wasn't ah wasn't tired okay one of the middle's angry but it doesn't matter because I can just do this until I figure it out uh flatter and
[66:37.43]I began to think about this, now it's very happy that I said that.
[66:42.04]Come on.
[66:47.64]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:50.68]Happy's body beats audibly.
[66:54.00]X Flatter.
[66:55.86]You ordered Rousey to flatter all the enemies.
[66:57.80]Oh, you can do... I get it.
[66:59.85]You don't need experience, just encountering your smile is rewarding enough.
[67:06.71]Why did somebody just say the... Alright, spare them both.
[67:17.18]Spare, spare, spare.
[67:19.68]Great job, Curse.
[67:20.26]We earned 0 XP and $88.
[67:23.70]Sweet!
[67:23.97]How much do I get?
[67:25.83]You lost.
[67:26.71]You don't get anything.
[67:28.25]Oh.
[67:28.39]Can I have some of yours?
[67:31.47]No.
[67:32.61]Fine.
[67:33.13]Later losers.
[67:42.96]I'm still just standing here.
[67:43.98]Sup?
[67:45.34]I thought you were running away.
[67:47.26]Yeah, I finished.
[67:47.96]Alright, that's... That was funny.
[68:01.38]That was funny.
[68:02.04]Come on, that was cute.
[68:03.26]My cuteness was up, but that's why.
[68:38.40]That's scripted.
[68:39.24]That's scripted guys, excuse me.
[68:41.82]That's scripted.
[68:45.00]He can't solve it.
[68:46.26]I physically can't solve it.
[68:50.99]Come on, man.
[68:52.23]Open your door, you stupid door.
[68:55.09]Oh, great.
[68:55.45]It's you guys.
[68:57.59]Susie, we were ever so worried about you.
[69:00.51]How'd you get past those spikes before?
[69:02.69]Walked through them.
[69:03.97]But this door sucks.
[69:06.29]Oh, don't worry, Susie.
[69:07.41]It'll open after we solve the puzzle over there.
[69:10.45]Nice.
[69:10.77]Tell me when you finish it.
[69:13.03]Uh, Susie, we need you to finish it.
[69:16.15]Sometimes proceeding will take all three of us.
[69:19.23]Furthermore, only Chris can seal the Dark Fountain.
[69:21.55]So if you don't accompany us, you won't make it home.
[69:24.80]So you're saying I have to stick with your rule?
[69:28.46]Yep.
[69:33.55]Let's just get this over with.
[69:35.81]Yahoo!
[69:36.93]Suzy's... Yahoo!
[69:40.53]Suzy's back on the team.
[69:41.81]Cue the fanfare.
[69:50.67]Susie joined the party.
[69:51.97]That was long.
[69:58.03]Susie follows at a distance such that no one can tell she's associated.
[70:15.09]Not anymore.
[70:15.61]All right, here we go.
[70:17.38]Three, two, one, action!
[70:27.24]Action!
[70:32.13]Did it!
[70:32.45]Step on it!
[70:45.10]And Chris, if you need help with the puzzle, feel free to ask me.
[70:48.04]No.
[70:48.62]And if you need help from me, you're screwed.
[70:50.48]Just wait.
[70:52.26]Let me- How- It's gotta be like... this.
[71:28.73]Yeah!
[71:33.59]I can't do it.
[71:34.72]I'm just gonna scream Yahoo.
[71:38.66]But I would have, like, peaked the microphone so loudly.
[71:41.06]Oh, that's no dog!
[71:46.47]Oh, Chris, I just realized Susie missed the tutorial.
[71:49.49]Next battle, we should show her how to act.
[71:54.65]I think she might really enjoy that.
[72:01.16]C round attacked violently.
[72:02.98]You recall Rousey's advice to include Susie in an act.
[72:08.42]Okay, act.
[72:09.26]No, no, don't hurt.
[72:10.28]C round.
[72:12.35]Uh, compliment.
[72:15.15]You recall, uh, Rousey, you're just gonna defend.
[72:18.77]You ordered Susie to flatter the enemy.
[72:22.95]What?
[72:23.31]Why the hell would I do that?
[72:24.93]It attacked us.
[72:25.75]Let's smash it before it moves.
[72:28.54]Oh, look Susie, it seems harmless.
[72:30.94]If you act nice, we might win without hurting it.
[72:34.68]Okay.
[72:35.56]Hey, little guy.
[72:37.24]I really like the axe on your face.
[72:39.74]Oh.
[72:48.68]Am I gonna get the bad ending because of that?
[72:52.11]I'm gonna get the bad ending.
[72:56.37]Hee hee hee, I sneaked by and made a sign.
[73:00.81]Fucking weirdo.
[73:01.63]Wow, look at that guy over there.
[73:03.21]Wow.
[73:15.06]Susie, listen.
[73:16.66]As heroes, we have the power to make a peaceful future.
[73:19.72]So, from now on, let's try avoiding fighting.
[73:25.19]Uh, what if you just took it easy on me?
[73:27.26]If you weaken an enemy, I can use my pacify spell, which can put exhausted people to sleep.
[73:32.70]Yawn, yeah, your talking is already doing that.
[73:35.58]Well, um, just think about it.
[73:37.20]You might have to warn enemies about her.
[73:38.82]Oh god.
[73:46.64]The violent tormentor is now your ally.
[73:48.64]The power of mean girls shines within you.
[74:10.39]hey kid you wanna buy a tutorial it's only $50 dark dollars really you're really gonna buy it right this way
[74:30.14]I'm TP Master.
[74:30.68]Ask me about TP.
[74:31.14]Secret.
[74:31.58]TP only lasts inside a fight.
[74:33.01]Once you win, it's out of sight.
[74:34.11]Having extra feels unbearable.
[74:35.85]No point in saving.
[74:36.79]It's straight up terrible.
[74:58.22]But leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of a battle.
[75:01.54]You mean I only should have been using one square?
[75:04.22]I'm Rousey Master.
[75:13.11]Ask me about Rousey's... fact.
[75:17.21]Rousey loves when you give us money.
[75:19.69]He will hug you and call you honey.
[75:22.61]Hey, that's not true.
[75:23.53]You don't need money to get me to do that.
[75:27.67]I'm Susie, Master.
[75:28.63]Ask me anything about Susie.
[75:31.25]Uh, fact.
[75:32.77]Susie loves when you give us money.
[75:34.25]She will... Nope, don't care.
[75:36.17]Did I say something funny?
[75:37.93]Why do they all have different hats?
[75:42.33]I'm Fris, Master.
[75:43.91]Ask me anything about Fris.
[75:46.43]Fact.
[75:47.59]It's a good idea to give us bucks.
[75:49.41]It'll make you happy and fill you with lux.
[75:51.79]Over there is our donation hole.
[75:54.12]We had a box, but it got stole.
[75:59.46]If you like our tutorials please throw your money into a hole.
[76:02.84]You put a dollar in the hole.
[76:04.91]The hole became full.
[76:23.94]The hole is filled to the brim with cash.
[76:26.96]I put a dollar in.
[76:27.74]The king didn't even give us severance pay.
[76:31.01]His son just gave us all beanies.
[76:33.25]Itchy beanies.
[76:36.95]That was a fake... That was just a large cartoon dollar.
[76:44.26]You guys know fun fact?
[76:45.34]That's not even true.
[76:47.52]Never mind.
[76:47.88]It's a lie.
[76:58.48]Hehe, welcome, travelers!
[76:59.46]Alright, what do you got?
[77:03.60]Uh, star-shaped candy that heals 40 HP.
[77:06.80]Mysterious hamburger heals 70 HP.
[77:11.03]Uh, defensive charm.
[77:12.37]And a spooky sword.
[77:14.67]I feel like this is probably important.
[77:19.27]Do I have 200 bucks?
[77:27.95]I already have two candies.
[77:28.97]Can I get a burger?
[77:31.79]That's a lot of money, though.
[77:35.73]Seventy dollars for a hamburger?
[77:36.90]That's kind of insane.
[77:38.84]Alright, if I got a burger, I'm gonna buy one of these cards, too.
[77:47.12]Talk about yourself.
[77:51.76]The name's Sheem.
[77:53.66]Pronounced Sean.
[77:56.78]And this is my little sheep.
[77:58.88]It's... Haha, over the years, I've collected odds and ends.
[78:02.50]Of course, I have no attachment to any of it.
[78:04.78]It's just a hobby of mine.
[78:06.94]Around here, you learn to find ways to pass the time, or go mad like everyone else.
[78:12.78]Lightners?
[78:14.90]Long ago, the Darkners lived in harmony with the Lightners.
[78:20.08]They were like gods to us, our protectors, our creators, those who gave us purpose.
[78:23.90]Then one day we were all locked away in this prison, and the Lightners never returned.
[78:30.77]Embittered, the King took up arms and aims to take revenge upon the Lightners that left us behind.
[78:37.13]Of course, even among his troops, some still distantly hope the Lightners will return.
[78:45.80]We're legendary.
[78:46.86]Ha ha ha.
[78:47.42]So you are the heroes who are going to seal our fountain.
[78:51.03]Ha, good luck.
[78:51.51]It makes no difference to me.
[78:53.33]Neither light nor dark hold a future for a dark nerd in my condition.
[78:57.29]Okay.
[79:00.99]Historically, this land was ruled by the four kings.
[79:03.59]From Card Castle to the east, but recently a strange knight appeared and three of the kings were walked away.
[79:10.04]The remaining king put him and his strange son into power.
[79:14.43]This land hasn't seen this much chaos since.
[79:18.49]Laughing about it just a little bit.
[79:19.93]Well, you don't need to know about that.
[79:21.71]Okay.
[79:23.71]Thanks.
[79:24.82]Let's give it a save.
[79:30.44]The power of mean girls.
[79:40.53]Chaos.
[79:41.27]Chaos.
[79:42.25]Chaos.
[79:42.75]What do you mean chaos?
[79:47.63]We're sorry, we're normally puzzle guys, but yeah.
[79:50.29]Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[79:56.25]Uh... Gaining TP... You get TP when you defend.
[79:59.89]Then you can cast spells.
[80:00.95]Yeah, that's what I figured.
[80:02.93]Look for the heart outline when you get close to bullets.
[80:05.37]Oh wait, hold on.
[80:08.01]Because it's important.
[80:10.49]So when you barely get hit by something, it gives you defense points.
[80:13.89]Say that again?
[80:18.15]You get TP when you defend, protect yourself, then cast spells.
[80:20.51]You also get TP by getting close to bullets.
[80:22.85]Look for the heart outline.
[80:24.27]Okay, so I wasn't getting actually, I wasn't getting hit by anything.
[80:26.26]Okay.
[80:27.42]Okay.
[80:41.15]So as long as I get close enough.
[80:42.47]What's in the door?
[80:49.58]It's a lone doorframe, but for some reason you can't see through it.
[81:00.35]Well, flip my flapjacks.
[81:01.97]The clowns are back in town.
[81:04.59]Well, bad news.
[81:05.35]Since you last saw me several minutes ago, I've created a brand new fighting team ready to stop you.
[81:10.49]Not even the purple girl can stop me now.
[81:13.43]Oh, what are you ready for me?
[81:15.92]Stop talking.
[81:17.38]Ho ho ho.
[81:18.48]What is that?
[81:19.10]Why are you saying that?
[81:20.88]Ho ho ho.
[81:22.44]It's my evil laugh.
[81:23.28]Scary, right?
[81:23.96]You sound like baby Santa Claus.
[81:28.13]Uh, you mean like in a badass way?
[81:31.07]Shut up.
[81:33.03]You really think you know how to be scary?
[81:38.83]Well, I, uh... Wrong.
[81:42.86]Man, one of these tough guys like you really pissed me off.
[81:46.22]They said you wouldn't know scary if they picked you up and bit your face off.
[81:50.57]Why does she want to eat people?
[81:52.73]That's not true.
[81:54.41]Really?
[81:54.71]Then why don't you prove it?
[82:01.45]Is she gonna eat this person?
[82:03.29]Let's start with the part where your face gets bit off.
[82:12.27]Oh, okay, I get it.
[82:13.86]Thank you, purple girl.
[82:17.10]What?
[82:18.36]Thanks, it was kind of you.
[82:20.08]To teach me how to be scary with an evil laugh.
[82:23.82]Hey, I wasn't... And now... You're going to be thrashed.
[82:36.92]Merry Christmas!
[82:40.36]I guess that's kind of an improvement.
[82:44.86]A board of Jigsars walked away.
[82:53.39]Alright, what do we got?
[82:56.55]I'm gonna probably warn the Jigsaw.
[83:02.87]You and Rousey warned the enemies about Susie.
[83:04.83]Everyone went on guard.
[83:09.03]Fighting?
[83:09.39]I love fighting.
[83:10.11]I have a rent payment to make.
[83:14.93]Ow!
[83:17.15]Uh, trying to calculate this month's rent.
[83:19.39]Well, they've been warned.
[83:20.17]So now let's befriend.
[83:26.60]Uh, I'm gonna just defend here.
[83:29.98]Barely left a finger and... Well, look, we have to be friends.
[83:35.34]Good.
[83:37.34]I always wanted a friend just like you.
[83:39.11]We're friends now.
[83:41.29]I do want to get barely hit.
[83:46.01]Uh, Jigsari is pretending to march.
[83:50.13]They're all good to go.
[83:55.23]Oh, wait.
[83:55.57]Uh-oh.
[83:55.97]Uh-oh.
[83:56.37]Uh-oh.
[83:56.59]Uh-oh.
[83:56.99]Uh-oh.
[83:59.65]Uh-oh.
[84:02.95]Thank God.
[84:04.74]We're friends now.
[84:05.50]Voila.
[84:11.61]Jigsaw is wishing it could quit its job.
[84:13.59]And double spare.
[84:14.63]You won, you got $73.
[84:15.45]Alright, now where's Papyrus 2?
[84:16.49]Oh no, not one of these.
[84:18.76]Oh look, Chris, another puzzle.
[84:20.04]Oh no.
[84:20.42]Let's read the instructions.
[84:41.34]Oh, the instructions are vandalized.
[84:43.35]It says, Thou fools, thou will never figure out how to do it now.
[84:49.65]Ruining instructions, that's definitely against the rules.
[84:53.03]Then it says, P.S.
[84:54.13]I make my own rules.
[84:55.98]R.K.
[84:57.66]Well, that explains that.
[84:58.60]Why don't we just climb over this spiked fence?
[85:04.78]Ah, because then we'd get impaled and die.
[85:07.89]Cool, I'll work on that, and you do the puzzle.
[85:11.19]Try your best.
[85:12.05]Why can't you just stand over there?
[85:15.41]Great job, Chris!
[85:16.05]I think you're on to something.
[85:17.50]I know I'm on to something.
[85:18.90]Give up whenever you feel like it.
[85:20.50]It's all good.
[85:21.66]What's with this angel and devil bullshit?
[85:38.82]You did it, Chris.
[85:39.44]Great job.
[85:40.46]Damn, didn't get to impale myself.
[85:42.54]Jesus.
[85:45.50]Good job, Chris.
[85:50.94]Galaxy brain.
[85:51.92]Always check the top.
[85:56.34]Always check around.
[86:02.25]From the bottom, the order of our rooms in Card Castle.
[86:05.71]Of course, if you haven't been there, you won't know it.
[86:23.48]Okay, really emphasizing that it's impossible if you haven't been there.
[86:27.26]So I have to see where all the rooms are.
[86:39.19]Is it impossible though?
[86:40.19]I'm killing this guy.
[86:43.25]No I'm not.
[86:43.77]What would Sans do?
[86:50.41]Warn the enemies about Susie.
[87:03.29]Matthew has a little secret!
[87:05.28]Okay.
[87:06.10]So, they're warned, let's... Uh... Let's... Convince.
[87:10.86]Is it lecture?
[87:11.74]Or convince?
[87:12.30]I'll just convince.
[87:15.10]He told Rudin to quit fighting and was utterly swayed.
[87:17.42]Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[87:21.64]Long live the guy who paid this.
[87:27.29]Shit.
[87:29.86]Okay, so I could Spare Rudin, and then... Spare Rudin, and then... Are they, are they Warned right now?
[87:42.27]Yeah, they're Warned.
[87:44.57]I could always... Pacify... No one's tired.
[87:56.22]Just kill them.
[87:59.84]That defeats the... I played the first game, and I know that... Spoilers for the first game.
[88:07.42]Why would you be watching this if you don't know about the first game?
[88:12.41]Whatever.
[88:13.51]You know what I'm about to say.
[88:14.35]Wow, Undertale spoilers?
[88:25.27]Don't act like you never played it.
[88:26.33]Alright, let's do Extreme Flatter.
[88:34.98]You don't need XP, just encountering your smile is rewarding enough.
[88:39.98]Now let's... my... face my diamond cutter!
[88:42.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[88:48.44]Alright, so.
[88:50.30]Spare.
[88:50.70]Spare.
[88:52.78]Congratulations!
[88:53.72]You win the game.
[88:55.72]Wait, Undertale's a game?
[88:56.60]Uh, it's an app.
[88:58.70]That's the proper way to say it.
[89:00.76]So, I mean... It's an app, man.
[89:06.65]All right, let me go this way Sign when you step into the light you'll return to where you were before I don't think I want to do that though All right, so we gotta go we're gonna wait till we get an opportunity right now
[89:37.82]Okay.
[89:42.16]More of that?
[89:43.26]More of this?
[89:43.64]Uh-oh.
[89:48.96]Con Man drew near.
[89:50.37]Alright, we got Con Man, Lullaby, or let's do Warning.
[89:57.51]Everyone went on guard.
[90:06.40]Ow.
[90:07.30]Ooh, I wasn't ready for that one.
[90:10.20]Hypnotize by your idle animation.
[90:11.96]Alright.
[90:13.94]So we can do, uh, let's lullaby... Let's lullaby.
[90:18.46]Sing a soft and entrancing lullaby.
[90:21.38]Convent fell asleep.
[90:22.31]Susie fell asleep.
[90:23.91]Enemies became tired.
[90:26.15]Okay.
[90:27.01]Well, that's good.
[90:29.29]Can't keep its eyes open.
[90:36.90]And I can pass it by.
[90:42.90]Now she won't attack.
[90:43.70]That's good.
[90:44.22]Although, she kinda has low HP.
[90:52.93]You kinda got low HP.
[90:57.65]Alright, we got another flash here.
[90:58.85]Back and forth.
[91:01.09]1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.
[91:01.51]Sure thing.
[91:08.99]Okay.
[91:11.77]There's Santa.
[91:14.39]So you've begun to cross the great board.
[91:16.28]The halfway point to our castle.
[91:19.54]Hmm, impressive.
[91:22.36]So it's a shame.
[91:25.60]You won't make it a step further.
[91:26.94]Because my guys are about to smash you into blood.
[91:30.72]Lots of blood.
[91:31.36]Splooshing blood.
[91:32.08]Very gross and bad.
[91:37.92]Hey, purple girl, was that scarier?
[91:39.56]Why are you asking me?
[91:43.12]Because you're really cool at being terrifying.
[91:45.14]I want to be as scary as you.
[91:48.04]You want to be like me?
[91:52.01]Yeah!
[91:54.11]Well, that's stupid.
[91:58.23]But, um, the new laugh isn't as awful.
[92:01.07]Saying you'd turn us into blood is, uh, cool.
[92:03.09]What's up with the bucket, though?
[92:07.38]It's to put the blood in.
[92:09.56]Oh.
[92:10.82]Yeah, I'm not supposed to make a mess.
[92:13.76]Anyway, thanks for your feedback.
[92:14.84]I'm really feeling scared.
[92:17.52]Oh, no problem, I guess.
[92:19.94]That's that.
[92:20.44]I write that.
[92:21.42]I do haha.
[92:24.44]So, are you guys gonna attack us, or... Oh, yeah!
[92:28.35]I was so excited, I forgot to bring any guys.
[92:30.61]But next time, it'll be the end for...
[92:34.18]Hey, I've just been calling you guys clowns.
[92:35.44]Does your team have an official name or something?
[92:40.36]Oh, Chris, we should come up with a name.
[92:41.70]No, we shouldn't.
[92:44.16]Then it's decided.
[92:44.84]Everyone puts a name in the bucket.
[92:50.85]Alright, everyone's put in their entry.
[92:53.89]Blue person, you can choose.
[92:56.02]Since you look like you don't care.
[92:57.47]Uh, crumpled paper, neat paper, or Lancer labeled paper.
[93:04.85]Definitely this one.
[93:06.32]You take the paper with Lancer written on the outside.
[93:09.88]You open it up.
[93:11.76]On the inside, it also says Lancer.
[93:14.81]Wow, who did that one?
[93:15.79]It's really good.
[93:18.59]Wait, why did you get to choose the name?
[93:20.09]Yeah, he didn't.
[93:22.21]Chris did.
[93:24.13]Yeah, it doesn't matter who may have written it.
[93:26.59]Regardless, Lancer is going to meet absolute doom.
[93:29.48]This name feels weird, actually.
[93:33.66]I know, let's call it the Lancer Fan Club for short.
[93:37.68]See you later, me.
[93:46.60]The power of the Lancer Fan Club shines within you.
[93:50.73]It sure does.
[93:59.31]Watch out!
[94:01.02]Ah!
[94:04.88]Ah!
[94:05.88]Alright, let me watch it.
[94:06.92]So, three, two... So it's safe up there.
[94:11.11]It's safe up in the corner there.
[94:13.89]So just stand here.
[94:15.53]So then it's safe in the middle.
[94:18.12]No, it's not.
[94:19.24]It's safe in the... I mean, it is.
[94:22.34]It is now.
[94:22.74]Oh!
[94:26.58]I'm getting, like, electrocuted.
[94:28.28]Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[94:41.24]Okay, I'm good.
[94:45.32]This streamer, man.
[94:48.52]What?
[94:48.68]If you've got to say something, say it to my face!
[94:50.34]If you've got to say something, say it to my face!
[94:54.96]That's, uh, Warren.
[94:56.45]You and Rousey warned the enemies about Susie.
[95:01.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[95:02.73]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:03.49]Show us your face then.
[95:04.91]Uh, I gave your child to my weapon.
[95:07.81]What?
[95:14.56]It's not here.
[95:18.02]Okay, now we can act.
[95:22.63]We can do a lullaby.
[95:25.47]Put everybody to sleep.
[95:33.36]Susie fell asleep.
[95:34.58]They're all tired.
[95:36.28]And here we go.
[95:42.92]Can't keep his eyes open.
[95:44.56]Good.
[95:44.84]Cause you're out.
[95:46.72]Uh, good.
[95:47.58]Uh, you're out.
[95:53.08]Nice Joker reference.
[96:00.19]Stop!
[96:00.65]I got hit.
[96:01.09]I shouldn't have gotten hit by that.
[96:06.51]Pawn man can't keep his eyes open.
[96:07.98]Let's... I'm gonna put you back to sleep again.
[96:15.21]Well, that don't even matter.
[96:16.01]Never mind.
[96:16.87]See ya.
[96:19.15]I need to heal, uh, Susie.
[96:22.09]Susie's hurt.
[96:26.01]What is that thing?
[96:30.75]Great Board 2.
[96:33.77]It's Fire Man.
[96:36.19]Look at this dude!
[96:38.28]Whoa there, horsey.
[96:39.82]Pine men are scary, but...
[96:42.31]All in all in all they're doing is following the king I Saw on the board used to have our own boss those were the peaceful times But now even a boss has been reduced to the Kings peon My name mr. Elegance haha and these these are my nostrils not my eyes Can still see out of them though Interesting
[97:15.21]Fear not.
[97:15.59]We, unlike the simple pond men, possess full faculty over our actions.
[97:19.73]I, Mr. Society, am far too intelligent to ever bow down to such a tyrant.
[97:24.93]Unless he asks me.
[97:25.99]He's very scary, you see.
[97:29.01]What?
[97:29.55]You think you possess the power to topple that brute?
[97:32.41]Yes, yes, yes.
[97:33.23]I'm sure everyone will support you.
[97:34.49]Go for it.
[97:35.63]Just as long as I don't have to participate.
[97:40.67]Okay, thanks.
[97:45.45]Oh, well, step on my boots.
[97:48.02]If it isn't the Lancer fan club.
[97:50.00]You boys or girls had better turn back while you can.
[97:54.26]Lancer, what is it this time?
[97:56.24]Oh, I'm simply warning you.
[97:58.64]Nothing extremely dangerous is lying ahead.
[98:02.12]Oh, it's actually really inconvenient.
[98:05.99]I can't go home at all because I'm so scared.
[98:09.17]What is it?
[98:13.16]We already fought this dog.
[98:14.08]Hey, it's a little guy.
[98:16.76]That's what you're afraid of.
[98:18.86]Wow, purple girl, you aren't scared?
[98:21.80]Why would I be?
[98:22.42]What's it gonna do?
[98:23.00]Hmm, well, normally...
[98:39.72]It crushes people to death, I think.
[98:43.22]Here it comes.
[98:50.19]K-Round.
[98:52.05]Deep bow warning.
[98:56.01]Let's do a warning.
[98:57.61]You explained to K-Round about the importance of dodging Susie's attacks, but it didn't seem to understand.
[99:04.30]Well... Oh god, okay, it just jumps.
[99:13.55]Well, let's bow.
[99:14.75]You and Rousey bowed.
[99:16.07]Okay, round bowed back.
[99:18.15]Its crown loosened.
[99:19.21]That's it, Chris.
[99:21.17]If we can get its crown off, it should turn back into a little guy.
[99:24.98]Susie, help us bow at it.
[99:27.32]Nah, its crown will come off when I smash the guy to the ground.
[99:33.10]Well, I'm gonna have to put you to sleep.
[99:42.19]Uh, can I... I don't have, like, a lullaby.
[99:45.15]I guess we can do a deep bow.
[99:52.34]The crown is 20% loose.
[99:55.58]Is there anything I can do to make you... I guess I can... Here, I'll do this.
[99:59.38]I'm gonna bow.
[100:02.97]Pacify.
[100:03.55]Can I pacify?
[100:04.55]No.
[100:04.61]Figured maybe I could, um, pacify Susie.
[100:12.20]Alright.
[100:16.58]Well, I can bow, and then... Heal prayer.
[100:21.41]I can't heal.
[100:27.01]Heal ally.
[100:28.37]Spare.
[100:28.97]Okay.
[100:30.07]Well.
[100:32.17]Looks like we're doing the super bow.
[100:38.39]Bowed back.
[100:39.00]It's crown loosened.
[100:43.43]Ah!
[100:45.21]Felt stressed out and attacked.
[100:47.33]Kayron practiced self-care.
[100:49.07]What was that?
[100:50.03]Was that like almond milk?
[100:52.78]Kayron's HP and attack went up.
[100:56.88]Susie, stop attacking it.
[100:57.90]You're making it stronger.
[101:00.42]Better think I'm afraid?
[101:01.46]No way.
[101:03.60]The crown is 40% loose.
[101:04.89]Just another deep bow.
[101:13.36]Okay, round about back.
[101:14.62]The crown loosens again.
[101:19.62]Whoa!
[101:23.04]Oof!
[101:23.86]Oof!
[101:24.50]Oof!
[101:26.39]Oof!
[101:28.89]No, no.
[101:29.11]Uh... I'm gonna bow, and then I'm gonna heal.
[101:36.99]Because you just won't listen.
[101:42.37]Heal prayer.
[101:48.11]Oh my god, why was I not paying attention?
[101:49.65]I was just staring.
[101:52.91]Crown is 75% loose.
[101:59.25]Deep bow should do it, right?
[102:00.71]Or then I'll be at 95.
[102:01.58]I think we're fine.
[102:02.92]Deep bow.
[102:07.20]Okay, round about back.
[102:07.94]It's crown.
[102:08.30]Loosen one more time.
[102:12.84]Time to get in the dryer now.
[102:18.71]I can't imagine doing that.
[102:21.85]There's probably some fucking guy on YouTube that was like, it's me, Bill Crazy.
[102:26.74]And today I'm getting in a fucking dryer.
[102:28.94]That's right.
[102:29.48]I'm sure it exists.
[102:35.06]And we're going to turn it, not only are we going to turn the dryer on, we're going to put it on high heat and high speed.
[102:45.96]Alright, we're gonna bow.
[102:48.19]Just deep bow again.
[102:54.57]I'm not doing this bullshit.
[102:55.73]I ain't going on, like, permanent press.
[102:59.09]I think I won.
[103:14.46]Have I made this joke before about getting in the dryer if I lost?
[103:19.88]You clowns really are heroes.
[103:21.06]You saved the next 20 minutes of my life.
[103:25.09]We?
[103:25.31]What do you mean, we?
[103:26.79]We?
[103:27.21]When did I say we?
[103:30.33]Yeah, I'm making a reference to Bill Crazy again because he's going to be in the Rumble next weekend.
[103:34.89]I have to bring some of these characters that you haven't heard of in a while back so you know when you see them in the Rumble that it's like, oh, there he is.
[103:44.37]Oh yeah, if you weren't at the green screen stream, this next weekend here is, uh, Germania 2018.
[103:51.53]That's just like, there's like 600 characters.
[103:53.81]That's a lie.
[103:54.87]I'm lying a lot tonight.
[103:55.81]I've got to stop lying to you.
[103:58.16]Uh, Susie!
[103:59.52]Not to downplay your contributions, but you, uh, you didn't actually help at all.
[104:03.22]You only made everything worse by attacking.
[104:05.30]If you had just acted nice to it in the first place, we could have avoided that entire battle.
[104:11.90]Huh?
[104:12.10]Are you for real?
[104:13.70]That thing was bloodthirsty.
[104:15.98]The only thing keeping it at bay was my axe.
[104:20.15]And earlier, you terrorized those troops.
[104:22.65]Those guys were enemies, therefore terrorizing.
[104:26.57]Yeah, she's right.
[104:27.25]And before that, you ate an innocent person's cake.
[104:32.58]Cakes are also my enemy.
[104:36.61]Susie, whether you like it or not, you're a hero.
[104:40.25]One with the power to bring peace to the future.
[104:43.91]Could you please start acting like one?
[104:47.80]Yeah.
[104:48.70]When you lay it out like that, I've been a pretty bad hero, haven't I?
[104:55.20]Alright.
[104:55.98]You got it.
[104:56.60]I'll change my ways.
[104:57.32]From now on, I won't be such a rotten hero anymore.
[105:00.21]I'll just be one of the bad guys instead!
[105:05.62]Really?
[105:07.04]You're going to be on my team?
[105:09.18]Yeah, sounds way easier, honestly.
[105:10.98]Susie, you can't just- Quiet, Toothpaste Boy!
[105:18.15]Susie is my comrade now!
[105:20.93]Yeah, Toothpaste Boy!
[105:23.19]We're going to have monogrammed track jackets.
[105:29.28]Yeah, at sleepovers where we tell each other secrets.
[105:33.19]Um, yeah.
[105:34.27]Anyway, see you guys never.
[105:36.93]If you can even last that long.
[105:43.05]Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hard on her.
[105:47.05]But I just worry that if Susie is too eager to fight, then, well, let's just be kind to her, okay?
[105:53.44]I'm sure Susie will come around soon.
[106:00.96]Well...
[106:03.41]The blocking foliage grows thick above your head.
[106:05.93]The power of the forest shines within you.
[106:09.99]101 minutes and 37 hours.
[106:11.95]It's not that bad.
[106:15.05]Hey, kid.
[106:15.75]We met us to fix up this old thingamajig for you.
[106:18.80]It's some kind of door.
[106:19.72]It can take you anywhere you want in the world.
[106:22.04]As long as that's one of the two locations.
[106:24.92]Anywho, we'll keep working on it.
[106:26.66]Anything to help you out, kid.
[106:32.05]Now don't tell anyone Mr. Society helped.
[106:33.93]He doesn't want none of that.
[106:34.93]I'm watching you now with my nostrils.
[106:36.95]Okay.
[107:00.86]It's a door.
[107:01.64]Where will you go?
[107:03.64]Field, forest.
[107:05.18]Uh, field.
[107:06.26]The door opened.
[107:06.90]Okay.
[107:09.74]So this, okay, this is the door.
[107:11.00]To go back.
[107:13.76]Alright.
[107:22.83]Ah!
[107:22.97]Uh-oh.
[107:25.43]Ravik slithered in the way.
[107:29.24]Uh, breathe all?
[107:31.06]Press Z repeatedly to blow air.
[107:35.90]A refreshing boy.
[107:39.94]What?
[107:40.06]What the hell does that mean?
[107:45.60]Looking for a couch to get stuck under.
[107:47.41]Alright.
[107:50.33]No, no, no, no!
[107:51.43]Okay, I did it.
[107:51.97]I pressed the button too many times.
[107:59.54]I did attack and I thought I was gonna... ...punch the person.
[108:03.98]Alright.
[108:08.28]Susie!
[108:08.94]Lancer!
[108:11.76]Hehehe.
[108:13.26]Well, if it isn't the so-called heroes.
[108:15.62]Are you finally ready to see what happens... ...when you try to act soft... ...against a team that crushes anyone in their way?
[108:24.68]Dark Jack Lancer.
[108:26.56]Violent Axe Susie.
[108:28.66]Together we are... The Dark Lancer Fan Club.
[108:35.88]So what's your evil plan?
[108:36.90]Huh?
[108:40.10]Dude, we just formed our team.
[108:41.56]We haven't done anything past our intro yet.
[108:45.88]Have a little patience, please.
[108:48.68]Oh, sorry.
[108:49.56]We're looking forward to the rest.
[108:53.32]You won't have to look forward to it for long.
[108:56.06]Starting now, we're going to work ceaselessly.
[108:59.37]I couldn't say that.
[109:00.53]Unstoppably.
[109:02.75]To make an evil plan to thrash you clowns.
[109:06.31]Watch your backs.
[109:09.53]And your fronts.
[109:16.01]Unstoppably.
[109:17.28]What?
[109:20.28]Did I say it wrong?
[109:25.29]Fronch?
[109:26.53]What are you talking about?
[109:27.91]What do you mean, Fronch?
[109:34.44]What did I say?
[109:35.70]I says I'm... What?
[109:42.81]What happened?
[109:43.43]What is going on here?
[109:44.29]Oh, you're gonna breathe all those...
[109:58.67]Ambiently damage the soil of the hole.
[110:02.13]I can't even.
[110:03.53]I can't even, man.
[110:04.61]I can't even.
[110:05.81]I can't even.
[110:11.31]You won!
[110:11.89]Got 0 XP and $77.
[110:13.21]Is Jerma okay?
[110:16.47]I'm fine.
[110:19.13]I'm good.
[110:25.96]It's a stump with some kind of dinner hole in it.
[110:30.58]How's the evil scheming going?
[110:32.92]Huh?
[110:33.24]Oh, that.
[110:34.50]We got bored, so we're having a snack.
[110:37.78]I see.
[110:38.08]Come on, all I ate for breakfast was chalk.
[110:42.18]And I didn't eat anything.
[110:44.42]Sorry, what are you two having exactly?
[110:46.78]Just a daily treasure I hid in this stump's orifice.
[110:50.48]And that is?
[110:52.02]Feast for yourself, my main man.
[110:55.28]Chris, do you want to try it?
[111:00.55]Oh, uh, there's a honeypot inside.
[111:03.13]It's full of salsa.
[111:05.60]Bingo, you sweet little pumpkin.
[111:08.28]It's my secret stash, a little snack-a-roo from me to you.
[111:14.93]Mmm, yummy, it's delicious.
[111:16.31]Come on, you're just pretending to eat it.
[111:20.19]Yeah, that's what I do too.
[111:21.57]My power is lowered by my hunger right now, but once I eat something... You really shouldn't have pissed me off, man.
[111:37.18]It shouldn't have.
[111:39.90]Silence, you sweet basket of eggs.
[111:41.94]Our dark energy bends the rules of grammar.
[111:45.63]Yeah, egg boy.
[111:49.42]Just stump with some kind of dinner hole.
[111:52.56]Well, has everybody had enough?
[111:54.92]Constantly.
[112:01.61]That's what I do, too.
[112:04.15]Pretend to eat it.
[112:05.03]Oh, watch out, we're in Bowser's Keep.
[112:06.77]Oh.
[112:15.58]What the hell is that that guy is like a coat hanger It's a coat hanger and wi-fi kirby, who do I talk to first let's talk to wi-fi kirby I'm just a little ball.
[112:30.33]I don't want to discuss anything Okay
[112:39.88]You folks look like heroes.
[112:41.26]Take the scarf from this chest and defeat the king.
[112:43.98]Besides, it's old, ragged, and doesn't fit me anymore.
[112:47.18]That's what chests are for.
[112:48.34]It's kind of a hand-me-down situation in here.
[112:51.28]I used to work at the castle until the king fired all the staff.
[112:57.38]What was my job?
[112:58.14]Oh, I was a royal coat rack.
[113:07.14]Cool story, pal.
[113:09.69]You opened the Cheshire Trest.
[113:10.87]Inside was a ragger.
[113:13.21]You put the ragger in your weapons.
[113:15.93]Okay.
[113:18.00]Weapons.
[113:20.44]Put it in your weapons.
[113:24.31]I don't even know why.
[113:25.35]Red scarf.
[113:26.15]10-2.
[113:30.62]What do I have on... Wood blade.
[113:33.34]No, I guess it's yours.
[113:37.82]Amber card.
[113:38.80]That gets you to... No ability.
[113:45.47]Oh, I know.
[113:45.77]You already have the ribbon on.
[113:49.84]So that's just plus one defense.
[113:51.54]I forgot to put this on full time.
[113:54.12]All right, we got power.
[113:55.08]Number one prickly prince deals damage with his rugged scarf.

[120:11.66]You put dice brace in your armor.
[120:15.05]Chest is empty.
[120:15.57]Well, except for some vowels.
[120:16.63]What?
[120:19.67]Okay, we need to go... Hmm.
[120:23.45]Hmm.
[120:28.46]dice brace is better than the card.
[120:33.77]Yeah, amber card.
[120:35.49]That sucks.
[120:35.99]I'm going to have to sell it.
[120:49.31]Oh, there are two armor slots.
[120:50.23]Okay, I didn't even really... Yeah, that's pretty simple.
[120:56.44]Alright, save.
[120:57.36]We need to go ahead.
[121:00.19]Chest.
[121:01.03]Pants.
[121:01.47]Be happy.
[121:03.95]Yes, you are.
[121:05.83]Oh, you mixed me on nothing.
[121:07.11]Nice.
[121:07.55]Okay.
[121:11.52]Right down the middle.
[121:13.92]Don't kill.
[121:16.94]Don't fight.
[121:23.37]Act and spare in the same turn.
[121:24.51]I guess that's true.
[121:25.57]So you can kind of queue it up.
[121:27.17]Alright, two armor slots.
[121:29.10]I'm going to give it to... Probably should have a magic user that can heal.
[121:39.70]Be able to live the longest.
[121:42.04]That's what I would say.
[121:43.07]Okay.
[121:49.75]Hole.
[121:51.13]Oh...
[121:53.45]RK came by.
[121:54.53]What a hunk.
[121:55.71]He vandalized the puzzle to stop the Lightners, but we know the answers.
[122:00.77]Oh, you want to get through?
[122:01.78]Of course.
[122:02.38]We'll tell you.
[122:04.14]The first symbol is a heart.
[122:05.46]Ah, just like love.
[122:06.34]Does that help?
[122:10.46]Heart.
[122:13.20]Oh, symbol puzzle.
[122:15.04]All the symbols were different, I think.
[122:16.94]You can still see the colors they were, too.
[122:20.10]Sorry, I can't be any more help.
[122:22.58]Alright, so that... So the one on the left, so it's a heart, so it's heart, something, uh, heart, something, diamond.
[122:34.92]Heart.
[122:35.26]Uh, let's just try this.
[122:37.40]Oops.
[122:41.26]Oops.
[122:46.56]Nope.
[122:47.03]So it's heart, spade, diamond.
[122:52.23]You got it.
[123:06.72]Hey!
[123:07.58]It's my birthday today!
[123:08.94]And you didn't even say hello?
[123:10.26]That's fine, actually.
[123:11.32]What?
[123:11.56]Yes I did.
[123:14.86]Stop and say hi, folks.
[123:16.14]Shut up.
[123:16.48]They don't deserve us.
[123:17.33]Hey, calm down, you two.
[123:19.43]Let's celebrate my birthday.
[123:20.65]Yeah, get ready to hurt.
[123:21.77]Oh, I'm sorry about this.
[123:26.05]Clover grew close.
[123:30.01]Okay, we got... Talk boys, talk sports, talk birthday.
[123:38.24]Talk birthday.
[123:39.86]What would you like for your birthday?
[123:41.82]Let's just have a nice chat.
[123:43.28]Idiot, ask for a gift.
[123:44.50]Just discuss our likes.
[123:48.19]Uh, let's just have a nice chat.
[123:49.91]Seems like you should talk about something else.
[123:52.57]It's my birthday!
[123:53.15]No, it's my birthday!
[123:53.99]We're triplets!
[124:00.37]Apparently.
[124:02.27]Okay, uh, so let's talk about... Let's talk about boys.
[124:09.05]Um, what kind of boys do you like?
[124:11.19]Cute ones!
[124:11.80]Nice ones!
[124:12.26]Uh, I mean, all boys.
[124:15.34]Seems like Clover enjoyed talking about that.
[124:18.24]Glasses are cute, I think.
[124:19.26]Fluffy glasses.
[124:20.28]Uh, sure.
[124:27.74]Clover hums like an out-of-tune choir.
[124:33.21]Talk sports.
[124:34.53]Talk animals.
[124:35.43]Talk trees.
[124:39.45]Can I talk, uh, talk sports?
[124:41.83]No, talk trees.
[124:44.01]We'll talk sports.
[124:47.58]Do you like, uh, sports?
[124:49.76]I want to eat a football!
[124:50.56]Sports!
[124:50.86]My favorite food!
[124:51.48]Oh, I love YouTube!
[124:52.24]I enjoy talking about that.
[124:55.12]Spaghetti and tennis balls!
[124:56.12]That's genius!
[124:56.68]We really agree on it!
[124:57.54]Seems tired of discussing so much.
[125:06.74]Not yet.
[125:10.03]I guess I could just pass it by.
[125:11.39]Oh, I don't have enough!
[125:15.55]I don't have enough.
[125:19.07]Wait, I could defend with him.
[125:22.71]There we go.
[125:24.53]He won.
[125:35.50]Spaghetti and tennis balls.
[125:37.16]Oop.
[125:42.48]Save it!
[125:43.78]In the heart of the woods, Bakesail stands quietly.
[125:46.44]The power of reoccurring Bakesails shines within you.
[125:50.76]Yes, it does.
[125:55.98]Interested in a Choco Diamond?
[125:59.30]All proceeds go to Rudin Relief Funds.
[126:01.55]I guess it's only 40 gold.
[126:04.73]Sure.
[126:05.83]Thanks, I guess.
[126:06.43]The Choco Diamond was added to your items.
[126:10.96]All proceeds go to kicking your ass.
[126:12.50]Sure.
[126:12.68]Heh, thanks.
[126:13.04]A Lancer cookie was added to your items.
[126:39.99]for getting cheated by us.
[126:41.22]Now we may fund our illicit plans.
[126:47.40]What?
[126:47.64]I don't understand.
[126:58.22]This cardboard stand is actually just a fake cardboard stand of a cardboard stand.
[127:03.65]Is it not?
[127:07.13]Oh, they bought food.
[127:10.79]Alright, so how should we split this jelly donut?
[127:13.83]I'll take the blood and you take the skin.
[127:15.87]That's such a disgusting way to talk about a donut.
[127:24.69]All real plans allocate for delicious treats.
[127:28.18]Sounds like you need to go to plan school, Dr. Toothpaste.
[127:32.86]Oh yes, earn a second doctorate, smart genius.
[127:36.16]Am I being made fun of?
[127:38.70]I believe you are.
[127:40.88]Uh, but interestingly enough, that's Diamond, Heart, Spade.
[127:43.76]So, maybe I'll need it in a second.
[127:51.72]Diamond, Heart, Spade.
[127:54.46]Oh, look, a door.
[127:56.55]Where will you go?
[127:57.33]Uh, we're gonna stay at the bake sale.
[127:59.19]Amazingly, you are already there.
[128:03.23]Diamond, Heart, Spade.
[128:07.97]Uh...
[128:11.74]You don't look like a diamond, a heart, or a spade door.
[128:25.48]Well, well, I'm the Smith Malleus.
[128:27.32]I can fix anything, weapon, armor.
[128:29.21]I can even fix you.
[128:30.27]Well, what will it be?
[128:32.71]Fix us.
[128:35.03]Your body is a weapon, too.
[128:36.89]You must take care of it from time to time.
[128:39.09]Aha!
[128:40.09]Let's feel my technique.
[128:45.45]Somehow everyone's HP was restored.
[128:47.87]Well, don't you feel better after a nice massage?
[128:51.17]I can fix anything.
[128:58.42]Weapon, armor... I can even fix you.
[129:01.46]Fix item.
[129:02.84]That cake is seething with energy.
[129:04.32]You must let me fix it.
[129:06.18]Let's feel my technique.
[129:10.55]The broken cake was fixed beyond recognition.
[129:12.87]The broken cake became the top cake.
[129:15.46]This is truly a tremendous cake.
[129:16.98]Use its power wisely.
[129:31.79]This cake will make your taste buds spin.
[129:33.43]Heals 160 HP to the team.
[129:37.66]Heart's Donut.
[129:38.88]It's filled with... This is clotty red jam plus a certain amount of HP.
[129:43.13]A cookie shaped like Lancer's face.
[129:46.11]It's maybe not even a cookie.
[129:47.39]Heals 5 HP.
[129:48.55]Maybe.
[129:50.37]It's quite small, but some people really like it.
[129:53.05]Plus random HP.
[129:56.13]Dom has just said something else.
[130:00.88]Dark Burger.
[130:01.72]A mysterious black burger made of... Hey, this is just burnt.
[130:04.96]70 HP.
[130:10.32]Okay.
[130:12.22]A red and black star that tastes like marshmallows.
[130:16.49]And the glow shark.
[130:17.51]So I got the cake.
[130:19.73]Let me take this opportunity to... Let me take a quick break.
[130:24.78]I want to grab some water.
[130:28.14]And use the urinal.
[130:30.48]I will be right back.
[130:33.10]I'll leave the music on because I know that everybody loves this music.

[131:46.42]Thank you.
[132:13.04]Thank you.

[135:00.23]That's pretty much all there is to it.
[135:01.25]All right, let's go.
[135:04.15]You can.
[135:06.13]Do I need joy?

[136:45.25]Rearrange, and you defend.
[136:49.33]Does it have to be in any particular order, or does it have to be the same one every time?
[136:56.13]Well, uh, that's not working.
[136:57.83]Why are none of these working?
[136:59.19]Oh, it's because it's wide.
[137:03.37]Playing on an Xbox One, by the way.
[137:07.88]Ooh, I'm gonna knock your block off.
[137:13.62]Like Tetris.

[137:45.25]You're welcome, buddy.
[137:47.03]Uh, I don't know, I was reading chat.
[137:55.72]I need to pay attention to that.
[137:57.48]I can't just... I'm just looking over here or whatever.
[137:59.68]Time to get in the fucking dryer.
[138:02.35]Little worm guy.
[138:10.49]Before the King Kangalon, I used to eat the leaves from this tree.
[138:13.47]Now I still do that.
[138:14.96]Such is the way of the worm.
[138:18.70]Alright.
[138:19.30]Can I eat leaves?
[138:22.44]Eat leaves.
[138:23.02]I guess I can.
[138:26.84]Steal the dryer.
[138:31.31]What the fuck?
[138:33.51]Why was I allowed to go through here?
[138:34.55]Is there a weird shortcut?
[138:40.69]Uh... Okay.
[138:45.43]40 dark dollars.
[138:47.03]Somebody's secret stash was over here.
[138:57.58]Alright, we got dancers.
[138:59.98]Just have to join the line here.
[139:02.76]So, let's try down.
[139:10.20]Down to the left.
[139:10.86]I see a chest over there.
[139:11.73]I kind of want it.
[139:19.51]Inside was Revive Mint.
[139:21.63]You put Revive Mint in your items.
[139:24.03]Probably bring somebody back to life, I would assume.
[139:28.33]Is it just me or does Jerma seem pissed off today?
[139:30.55]Pissed off today?
[139:31.37]What?
[139:34.05]Why?
[139:34.39]What happened?
[139:35.25]I'm pissed off.
[139:42.29]I picked the worst one to go in.
[139:47.46]Can I go down from here?
[139:51.89]Look at how angry he is.
[139:53.51]What?
[139:55.10]I'm fine.
[139:56.36]I'm doing good.
[139:57.28]I'm happy.
[139:58.42]It's a good day today.
[140:01.78]What did I do?
[140:02.40]There's a secret path down?
[140:16.47]Jesus Christ, chill out.
[140:24.21]You're listening to one guy.
[140:26.63]Yeah, I don't know.
[140:27.48]I don't see a path.
[140:30.38]Guys, I'm fine.
[140:34.34]I'm fine, alright?
[140:35.08]I'm fucking fine.
[140:36.22]Okay?
[140:36.74]I'm not angry.
[140:38.16]What are you guys talking about?
[140:40.53]I'm fine.
[140:53.81]Oh, woe, woe is me.
[140:55.29]Rows and rows of woes and woes.
[140:57.01]If only a hero would help.
[140:59.81]Is everything alright?
[141:01.39]Oh, I'm not Lancer.
[141:02.69]I'm just a sweet little boy.
[141:05.11]Why does a sweet little boy have a mustache?
[141:07.57]As a disguise.
[141:12.30]So what kind of help do you need?
[141:14.16]See, I have this evil plan that I need to make.
[141:17.20]And why does a sweet boy need an evil plan?
[141:20.52]To impress his cool friend, Susie.
[141:24.90]If it's for friendship, well then, we'll gladly help.
[141:27.52]What shall we do?
[141:29.32]It's all on the paper, you delicious little apple.
[141:35.87]Just fill it with the most evil thing you can imagine.
[141:40.03]Oh, let the clown-generated content begin.
[141:42.53]I've been doing clown-generated content on this channel for years now.
[141:48.09]It hasn't been... I ain't seen nothing yet, by the way.
[141:53.51]Create a machine to thrash your own ass.
[141:57.38]Presented by Lancer Industries, which was just made up right now.
[142:01.98]Head.
[142:04.06]Laser sword.
[142:06.12]An enchanting gun with an air of mysticism.
[142:10.70]Okay, hold on.
[142:11.56]Elegant, lively, cute, hot, cool, and guns.
[142:19.17]I have to make it... Garbage.
[142:21.83]You're going to lose points.
[142:29.93]I don't want to do the duck.
[142:31.83]Everybody probably picks the duck.
[142:35.18]I want to do hot and cute.
[142:36.50]Okay, body.
[142:44.36]Plane.
[142:45.21]Streamlined chassis for an elegant thrashing.
[142:49.09]A fast chassis for a tomboyish thrashing.
[142:52.93]Chassis for gun lovers.
[142:54.07]The cannon is highly kissable.
[142:55.77]What?
[142:57.55]Duck.
[142:58.23]Just looking at this is making you lose points.
[143:03.70]I mean, I kinda like how that looks, though.
[143:08.44]And shoes.
[143:10.90]Sporty shoes for the athletic thrashing machine.
[143:14.44]Attractive wheels leading the way.
[143:17.36]And weaponized treads for raising sophisticated dinner parties.
[143:21.46]For ducks.
[143:22.49]You're going to lose points.
[143:26.63]I kind of like the Yoshi shoes.
[143:32.29]And we get cute points.
[143:33.23]Wait, I need the head color.
[143:34.31]Hold on, let me get it.
[143:54.79]See?
[143:55.59]I gotta do my colors.
[143:56.47]Alright, I like it.
[144:05.42]Nobody ever picks duck, actually.
[144:07.48]Wait, is this one of those self-fulfilling prophecies where everybody that plays this game thinks that everyone's picking duck so they don't pick it at all?
[144:16.31]It has to be, right?
[144:24.19]That's only Duck.
[144:28.87]Everyone picks Duck.
[144:34.00]I'll be the first one.
[144:35.02]No fucking way.
[144:36.68]I refuse to believe that.
[144:37.82]That I'm the first person that has streamed Undertale.
[144:41.40]Whatever, the sequel to it.
[144:42.38]Whatever it's called.
[144:43.73]Down Undertale.
[144:45.67]Takes place in Australia.
[144:48.37]I'm the only person that's ever done Duck.
[144:49.75]Is that what you're telling me?
[144:57.70]No, I want to do what I had before.
[144:59.30]I liked what I had before.
[145:02.10]I want to do flame.
[145:03.92]The duck body can stay.
[145:07.60]Alright, I'm doing it.
[145:12.64]Is this your machine?
[145:13.46]Yes, and it's really cute.
[145:14.74]It's really hot.
[145:20.10]Oh, it looks nasty.
[145:20.76]Are you sure you weren't evil?
[145:23.12]No, I suppose we just have a knack for it.
[145:26.23]Haha, tricked you, idiot.
[145:27.79]Never do something someone else can do for you for free.
[145:29.63]Never do something you can do for free for free.
[145:30.95]Do it for money.
[145:35.03]It almost looks kind of cute.
[145:37.53]Anyway, great job, Lancer.
[145:39.07]They were sitting ducks.
[145:46.54]Never do something you're good at.
[145:48.28]No, it's... If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[145:52.04]Another reference.
[145:53.02]He's bringing out the old material tonight, guys.
[145:54.84]Haha, yes, and it's all thanks to our enemies.
[145:57.58]Thank you very much.
[145:59.42]Thrash you later.
[146:01.88]Okay.
[146:07.49]It's nice Susie finally found a place she fits in.
[146:12.47]And she's getting along with Lancer, too.
[146:22.82]Hey!
[146:26.16]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[146:27.28]Wait, where's my save point?
[146:28.20]Don't die.
[146:28.88]You can do it.
[146:29.22]I'm gonna die.
[146:32.98]I'm gonna die.
[146:49.08]Um, I kinda need to eat candy.
[146:54.23]40 HP.
[147:01.68]No, I don't have to get in the dryer.
[147:02.74]I didn't die.
[147:05.40]Revolve around the center and look carefully.
[147:07.32]The darker it gets, the more you can see.
[147:11.19]Revolve around the center and look carefully.
[147:13.51]Let me check out... Whoa.
[147:15.33]Easy now.
[147:15.73]I'm just going to go all the way around and just take a look.
[147:23.12]So, I just have to go around the center.
[147:24.74]So, like here.
[147:29.07]The darker it gets, the easier it is to see.
[147:31.07]So, the lights are turning off.
[147:35.79]Hey!
[147:36.07]That's getting... That's coming up here!
[147:39.09]Okay, it's like a weird bird person.
[147:40.65]Wait, they're right here.
[147:45.78]Though hard to see, there was a switch in the tree.
[147:49.18]I thought that was just a... I thought it was a big bird.
[148:19.93]Anything else?
[148:20.47]Lancer cookie?
[148:21.77]Am I gonna need these for anything though?
[148:29.24]Go back and forth between... What am I doing?
[148:32.58]Go back and forth between this room and the last.
[148:35.54]Why am I getting spoilers?
[148:36.94]I don't want to be spoiled.
[148:53.12]No, why am I even reading chat?
[148:54.62]I'm gonna go.
[148:55.98]I shouldn't be doing that.
[149:03.77]It's not really a spoiler, it's something you probably never find on your own.
[149:07.79]Yeah, but I might go back and peruse around, you know?
[149:12.54]Go to the right.
[149:17.60]Alright, well, they're lying on two band-aids.
[149:19.28]I don't know why that is.
[149:20.18]Alright, so, ready to be a good guy again?
[149:22.10]Nah, I gotta say, being a bad guy's pretty sweet.
[149:28.25]Not only is it way more fun than being good, but my teammate's proud of what I do.
[149:33.23]Earlier, Susie ate a pine cone off the floor.
[149:35.83]It gave her a terrible stomachache.
[149:39.47]It was very brave and cool.
[149:41.80]See, finally some respect.
[149:50.60]Somehow Prince Lancer has made real friends with a Lightner.
[149:54.46]So somebody should tell the King immediately.
[149:57.40]It's definitely not going to be me.
[149:59.55]Whoever breaks the news is gonna get wrecked.
[150:03.89]Uh, how's the thrash machine we designed going?
[150:05.31]Uh, the what machine?
[150:07.19]The machine... we had a whole sequence about it.
[150:10.95]Oh, that.
[150:11.35]Yeah, we'll make it at the last minute.
[150:14.23]You two should really start working on it earlier.
[150:18.25]What's with the lecture?
[150:19.70]I didn't come here for a second dad.
[150:21.66]Yeah, you tell him.
[150:27.86]Oh, why does the King make us take care of his son?
[150:29.80]He's not a bad kid, but he's so weird and so obligatory.
[150:34.17]It's no wonder nobody really likes him.
[150:37.59]Damn.
[150:38.57]Oh.
[150:41.14]By the way, beware yourselves of the forest maze.
[150:43.88]You'll probably get completely lost.
[150:45.90]Without someone who knows the way through, that is.
[150:49.03]Yeah, I know the forest like the back of my head.
[150:50.69]Oh, there's a... And even Undertale is talking about Geno.
[151:01.33]And I... Okay.
[151:04.12]Where is he?
[151:06.76]Where is he?
[151:18.76]Yeah, this is a Super Mario RPG reference right here.
[151:22.18]This is what they're doing.
[151:26.94]So which way are we going next?
[151:29.18]We were following you.
[151:33.28]Oh, why?
[151:33.79]I have no idea where I'm going.
[151:37.79]First, let's just go wherever Lancer doesn't go.
[151:48.97]Or should I?
[151:49.55]Maybe, maybe I should do it eventually here.
[151:51.25]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nooo!
[151:55.18]Slow to the way!
[151:56.32]We're gonna blow.
[151:58.18]Breathe all.
[151:58.98]Press Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z. Easy.
[152:10.86]Let's spare him.
[152:19.18]I do like the... sort of left and right side of the screen.
[152:25.14]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[152:27.60]Find the secret?
[152:28.92]No.
[152:45.99]Hey, losers!
[152:47.21]Wait a second, where's Lancer?
[152:49.71]Well, he wasn't going the right way, so... You let him wander off by himself?
[152:54.53]You know he's bad at mazes, right?
[152:56.23]He's probably lost and confused right now.
[152:59.36]I'm lost and confused!
[153:01.32]Sorry, Susie.
[153:01.94]We didn't mean to make you worry about him.
[153:04.60]Oh, look, I'm not worried about him.
[153:06.94]Bad guys gotta look out for each other.
[153:09.22]Is all.
[153:09.84]Anyway, get out of my way.
[153:11.16]I'm gonna find him.
[153:13.43]See if she doesn't know the right way either.
[153:21.88]Well, they go the way that they're not going.
[153:27.36]What?
[153:27.54]What was the hitbox on that?
[153:28.60]Come on, man.
[153:34.37]Ah, go back!
[153:34.75]Can I go back?
[153:36.21]Whatever.
[153:36.49]Oh well.
[153:41.13]I keep forgetting.
[153:46.87]Because I could have just done, uh, spare.
[153:51.67]Instead of, uh, sitting here like this in defense mode.
[154:02.58]Sorry, German, for asking if you're pissed off and causing a wave of people telling you to calm down.
[154:06.25]We all love you.
[154:06.95]Can't wait for Germania.
[154:08.63]No, I'm just kidding around.
[154:12.03]I don't remember where that even went.
[154:15.71]Oh, I was wrong.
[154:16.65]Damn, I was sure he went this way.
[154:19.03]No way he could save his own damn self.
[154:20.85]Ah, I went the wrong fucking way too.
[154:30.86]Oh no.
[154:32.76]Oh shit.
[154:38.01]Okay.
[154:44.49]I can do the whole thing again.
[154:49.01]Right up the middle.
[154:51.71]And then... On the right.
[154:54.21]I don't want to fight you.
[154:58.10]And then... Oh, shit.
[154:59.54]Where are they?
[155:00.60]Go to the left.
[155:01.10]Right up the middle.
[155:06.66]Okay, I got it.
[155:11.31]Got it!
[155:15.17]Bad, cause mad.
[155:16.21]Bad, cause mad.
[155:17.23]Mad, because bad.
[155:18.81]Oh look, it's our toy, the toy we made.
[155:20.21]Isn't that the machine we designed?
[155:22.77]Alright, this will be tough, but let's try our best.
[155:27.62]Oh, that's, uh... That's not good, actually.
[155:33.04]Oh, you think that's bad?
[155:34.14]Just wait.
[155:35.46]And see what happens when it starts.
[155:36.92]The design sucked, so we blew it up.
[155:43.48]Oh, I see.
[155:46.14]So now what's your plan going to be?
[155:49.78]Turns out we didn't need a plan, just a rule.
[155:52.80]Anyone that gets in our way gets crushed into dust.
[155:57.34]That's a pretty good rule.
[155:58.86]But Susie, you need us to return home!
[156:01.06]Doesn't crushing us seem a little counterproductive?
[156:03.83]Nah, see, that's where you're wrong.
[156:06.17]You see, I know I can't get back without you guys.
[156:09.11]But being a good guy really isn't my style.
[156:13.81]So I thought of a little way we can just settle this.
[156:18.08]If you can beat me, I'll go back to being a good guy.
[156:21.18]But if you lose, you guys will have to become bad guys with us.
[156:26.58]And do whatever we say.
[156:27.36]Oh-ho, our wish is your command.
[156:32.41]So what do you say?
[156:36.27]Okay.
[156:37.99]We were just gonna thrash you anyways.
[156:39.71]See ya.
[156:48.26]Two bad guys blocked away.
[156:49.56]We've got Susie and we have Lancer.
[156:52.92]Lancer's probably easier to deal with.
[156:54.02]X anything.
[156:56.44]Anything.
[156:56.92]Anything.
[157:01.67]You told Rousey to compliment the enemies.
[157:04.73]You two look like a really great team.
[157:06.21]I'm proud.
[157:07.43]Lancer started to become a little convinced.
[157:10.66]Oh, it's working on me!
[157:11.68]Flattery won't work.
[157:14.54]What the fuck?
[157:21.57]Susie and Lancer are making fun of you.
[157:27.14]Uh, let's try Susie.
[157:29.86]Sing.
[157:30.22]Let's try to sing.
[157:33.25]Rousey sang a soft and entrancing lullaby.
[157:36.31]Doesn't it make people go to sleep?
[157:38.07]Susie fell asleep.
[157:40.23]Oh, what a beautiful song.
[157:45.65]Smells like teamwork.
[157:47.65]Alright, uh, so Susie's asleep.
[157:53.65]So now Lancer... Can I... You told to logically best Lancer and Susie.
[157:59.69]You two, if we don't stop fighting, then someone might get hurt.
[158:03.55]Lancer became more convinced it's working.
[158:06.09]Really?
[158:06.36]That's bad!
[158:06.98]Ow.
[158:07.78]Uh, having an evil laugh contest.
[158:16.50]Oh, she's asleep.
[158:19.50]Same thing, do it again.
[158:23.40]You told Rousey to offer his services to the enemies.
[158:28.24]You two, if we stop fighting, then I could braid your hair.
[158:32.66]Lindsay became almost fully convinced.
[158:35.08]Wow, I look amazing.
[158:36.50]I'm awake.
[158:36.91]Did I miss anything?
[158:37.81]Ow.
[158:43.13]Alright, let's do the same thing.
[158:48.49]Sing Susie to sleep.
[158:54.62]Good night.
[158:56.48]What a beautiful song.
[158:58.76]Whoa!
[158:59.82]I, for some reason, thought it was a job.
[159:01.60]I'm just an idiot.
[159:03.72]Alright, let's convince Lancer.
[159:05.34]Told Rousey to deal a final blow of kindness.
[159:08.09]In summary, I'd like you to and... I think we should all just get along.
[159:12.37]Uh-oh.
[159:14.95]What's wrong, dude?
[159:16.79]I accidentally started liking the enemies.
[159:20.41]Now seeing them just makes me feel round and soft.
[159:23.41]Bad atmosphere for battle, though.
[159:26.95]Well, if you don't want to fight, there's no point, I guess.
[159:30.69]Battle's over.
[159:34.82]Well, you didn't beat us because you, uh, kind of cheated by ganging up on Lancer with, uh, kindness.
[159:43.56]But if I have to, I guess I'll go back to your side.
[159:46.04]But don't expect me to do anything but fight!
[159:50.85]Well, we're happy to have you back.
[159:52.72]Sissy.
[159:54.48]Yeah, yeah, let's just hurry up and go home.
[159:57.88]Oh no, what about him?
[160:00.58]Um, should we see?
[160:02.36]Does this mean that we aren't a team anymore?
[160:06.40]Uh, I mean, uh, of course we're still a team.
[160:10.43]You can, uh, be part of the Lancer fan club.
[160:15.85]Wow, me in the Lancer fan club?
[160:19.58]Wait, if I hang out with the good guys, then can we still have monogrammed track jackets?
[160:26.80]Yeah.
[160:28.30]Rousey will make them.
[160:30.40]Huh?
[160:31.46]Oh, okay, sure.
[160:32.14]What's that face?
[160:38.01]Lancer joins the team.
[160:40.33]Lancer joined the party.
[160:43.39]This is a huge party.
[160:48.07]Wait.
[160:50.14]Why is he not... He's not following us.
[160:54.60]You can follow behind us, you know.
[160:56.68]Oh, okay.
[161:07.19]Chad.
[161:08.51]It's a lone doorframe, but for some reason you can't see through it.
[161:22.81]Wow, this is cool.
[161:24.07]I've never been on such a big team before.
[161:26.98]Don't you have a legion of various guys?
[161:29.70]Yeah, but my dad forced them to listen to me.
[161:32.10]So they don't actually like me very much.
[161:36.44]Yeah, well, you don't need those clowns anymore.
[161:39.11]Just chill with us.
[161:41.21]Aye aye.
[161:43.69]He's doing the Chad walk.
[161:46.65]He's doing the Chad thing.
[161:49.23]Oh, no he's not.
[161:52.53]Man, I'm still hungry.
[161:54.21]It's like nothing I eat here matters.
[161:55.79]Should have stolen more money for the bake sale, I guess.
[162:01.03]I was thinking of baking a cake later.
[162:03.63]Mmm, what's the catch?
[162:04.41]You have to stop making fun of me for one.
[162:08.12]Pass.
[162:14.24]I can't stop thinking about the chat thing.
[162:18.08]Looks as if he's a candy tree.
[162:19.52]Hell yeah.
[162:27.82]That has to be by design, right?
[162:29.44]It has to be.
[162:32.63]There's no way that he didn't do that on purpose.
[162:36.63]Damn, the last piece is too high to reach.
[162:39.99]Worry not, Susie.
[162:41.31]I have a special transformation for times like this.
[162:46.34]Really?
[162:47.36]Watch and learn.
[162:51.68]Look, stool form.
[162:55.41]All you did was put your hands on the ground.
[162:56.99]Hey, don't act so jealous.
[162:59.21]Hehe, got it.
[163:04.79]Ooh, tell me what it tastes like.
[163:07.45]Oh, you haven't had it before?
[163:08.47]Oh, I mean, I've always wondered what it's like, but I'm not allowed to pick it for myself.
[163:16.34]Well, you tell me what it tastes like.
[163:18.70]You're giving it to me?
[163:19.46]I thought you were hungry.
[163:21.00]Oh.
[163:24.32]It's her first act of real kindness.
[163:30.10]I changed my mind.
[163:30.96]Oh, Candy joins the team.
[163:37.19]All right, all ready, stop.
[163:48.33]So what's it taste like?
[163:50.82]Yum, yum, yum.
[163:51.86]It tastes like friendship.
[163:53.65]What's that taste like?
[163:56.17]Like my teeth are disintegrating.
[164:00.86]That's actually... Yeah, but thank you for sharing.
[164:05.22]You're a good friend.
[164:07.34]Well, uh... You too, I guess.
[164:17.63]Just walking along with you guys feels nice.
[164:20.83]Like I'm doing something important.
[164:22.35]That's because you're alongside the Lightners, Lancer.
[164:26.33]Our purpose... Darkner's purpose is to assist them.
[164:31.37]It's the only way we can truly feel fulfilled.
[164:35.60]Really?
[164:36.70]But my dad hates Lightners.
[164:38.16]He wants to... Does your dad seem happy?
[164:43.82]I'm not sure.
[164:46.18]Chadlock.
[164:50.21]Yeah, let's ditch the weird purpose talk.
[164:52.67]You're probably just glad you ate a weird berry.
[164:55.79]Yeah, I'm still boost from the juice.
[164:59.27]I mean, look, I'm not from here and hanging out like this.
[165:02.05]I also feel kind of, you know, happy.
[165:07.54]How long is this gonna go on for?
[165:12.94]Maybe.
[165:23.60]Look, everyone!
[165:24.94]We can see the castle!
[165:27.00]Yes, that's where I live!
[165:28.32]Me and, uh, my dad!
[165:31.88]What's that black thing emerging from the top?
[165:35.64]That's the fountain, Susie.
[165:36.88]If we can get there, you and Chris will finally be able to go home.
[165:42.61]Jeez, took long enough.
[165:44.23]Chris, Lancer, let's go!
[165:56.66]Are you sure there isn't another way home?
[166:01.12]Fountain is being guarded right now.
[166:02.82]If you try to go there, you might get hurt.
[166:08.04]But come on, Lancer.
[166:09.08]No one's going to beat a team like us.
[166:11.56]If anyone gets in our way, all we got to do is crush them.
[166:18.38]What if you had to fight?
[166:22.02]Everybody bleeds, right?
[166:23.74]Don't worry about it.
[166:25.77]Whoever it is, they'll be called on the ground before you can blink.
[166:29.47]Excuse me.
[166:32.07]What?
[166:34.97]I think I need to go.
[166:38.83]When are you coming back?
[166:44.85]Never.
[166:47.51]Hey, hey, wait a second.
[166:49.38]Why are you acting so weird?
[166:52.80]Uh-oh.
[166:53.82]Uh-oh!
[166:54.68]Uh-oh!
[166:58.32]Hey!
[166:58.96]The Lightners are approaching the castle!
[167:01.02]Get them!
[167:17.76]I mean, that's just what 700 days played.
[167:23.31]Nevermind.
[167:36.46]Lancer!
[167:39.08]No!
[167:39.80]You can't come in!
[167:41.14]What are you doing?
[167:43.92]We've cornered them!
[167:47.68]Wait!
[167:49.16]Ow.
[167:50.12]That's not good.
[167:55.92]You poor lighteners.
[167:57.72]We were told to keep you in prison for eternity.
[168:00.76]Too bad.
[168:02.36]Would have loved to see you guys punished.
[168:09.01]Ow.
[168:09.17]This is a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Chris?
[168:13.17]Prison for eternity.
[168:14.37]That sounds like it might take a while.
[168:19.21]And Susie.
[168:19.89]Where's Susie?
[168:25.59]We have to find her.
[168:30.14]We have to find her, Chris, before she gets hurt.
[168:33.44]Or, um, hurt someone else.
[168:35.14]Maybe there's something we can escape with in here.
[168:41.26]These shackles seem oddly fashionable.
[168:43.28]Take them.
[168:46.00]Iron shackle was put in your armor.
[168:50.45]Life cannot exist without consuming even the moss drink's water.
[168:55.54]Perpetuate the cycle of existence?
[169:00.28]Huh?
[169:05.03]You ate the moss.
[169:06.23]Tastes mossy.
[169:07.89]Your HP was mossed out.
[169:09.21]There's a crack in the wall.
[169:12.11]What could be inside?
[169:13.61]It's more wall.
[169:16.61]Welp.
[169:18.16]So, what did you find?
[169:20.02]What's all that green stuff around your mouth?
[169:22.26]Two minutes in jail and you've already resorted to eating moss.
[169:25.42]You're a real go-getter, Chris.
[169:28.90]So you couldn't find anything.
[169:29.78]Well, Chris, let's not give up hope just yet.
[169:32.68]But if we don't make it out for some reason... I just wanted to say... I'm glad I was able to meet... Hey, idiots, can you shut up?
[169:41.71]I'm trying to concentrate.
[169:45.19]Where is Susie?
[169:47.97]I don't know, prison?
[169:50.81]Seriously though, I'm out of my cell.
[169:53.07]I sweet-talked the warden into giving me the keys.
[169:57.56]How?
[170:02.72]I, uh, invited him to visit the trash can.
[170:06.32]Anyway, now there's a puzzle in the way.
[170:09.37]Okay, solve it, Susie.
[170:10.31]I, uh, I don't, I don't do puzzles.
[170:18.46]Hey, how about we just sit tight and wait for Lancer?
[170:21.74]He lives in the castle.
[170:22.72]He's bound to come save us.
[170:25.84]Why don't Chris and I just help you solve the puzzle?
[170:29.70]I don't need your help.
[170:31.73]But if you said what to do out loud, you know, I wouldn't stop you.
[170:37.19]Tell Susie what to do.
[170:38.29]Oh, God.
[170:40.15]Okay, so I...
[170:46.72]I need to swap?
[170:48.25]Okay, add spade, swap, add, no, no, add spade, add diamond, swap, add spade, add diamond, swap, add spade.
[171:06.54]Yes, we did it.
[171:08.36]Great, now come and free us.
[171:09.98]All right, all right, all right, all right.
[171:17.56]Thanks for helping her, Chris.
[171:18.46]She appreciates it.
[171:20.22]Chris, are you worried about Susie?
[171:25.75]Kind of.
[171:26.81]Probably.
[171:27.21]I mean, probably.
[171:33.11]Seems like...
[171:35.26]She's very she's very influenceable.
[171:37.66]She joined the bad guys because she wanted to be a bad guy.
[171:40.27]I know I'm a little concerned Well regardless of how you feel I don't think it would hurt to take a moment close your eyes and think about what she's doing now Oh another puzzle All right out of the cell where to next now fuck And there's a scary monster over there
[172:06.49]Oh, Chris, did you say something back there?
[172:08.05]I can't hear them anymore.
[172:10.40]I'll just go this way.
[172:14.12]Well, that's a dead end.
[172:18.14]That's Lancer's voice.
[172:23.28]Damn, not another one of these.
[172:25.94]Maybe I should go back and ask Chris.
[172:29.68]And make sure they... Lancer.
[172:36.20]I'll just do it myself.
[172:40.67]Come on, one more.
[172:42.45]You did it.
[172:44.69]Understand, they have to stay in their cells.
[172:47.03]The Lightners can't be allowed to escape.
[172:49.43]Especially the purple one.
[172:52.33]Lancer?
[172:53.03]Oh, Susie!
[172:56.70]What are you doing here?
[172:57.32]Uh, Lancer, Crimson Rousey is still locked up.
[173:04.04]I know.
[173:04.28]I...
[173:06.89]I was the one who told my troops to put you down here.
[173:09.73]To keep you down here.
[173:11.19]Forever.
[173:14.79]Lancer, you... You wanted to get rid of us?
[173:19.30]I thought we were a team.
[173:21.84]I can explain, Susie.
[173:26.46]Nah.
[173:27.22]It's fine.
[173:28.30]It's fine.
[173:28.77]Actually, it's fine.
[173:29.39]You don't have to say anything.
[173:30.93]I'm fine.
[173:31.91]I get it.
[173:33.35]You know.
[173:37.54]Why would anyone really want to be my friend anyway?
[173:42.76]I said shut up.
[173:45.92]But... Shut up!
[173:49.98]Shut up!
[173:50.28]Are we gonna see like a fucking death on camera here?
[173:55.49]Get out of my way.
[173:59.69]Did you hear me?
[174:00.81]Get out of my fucking way.
[174:05.64]No!
[174:05.84]Did you not hear me?
[174:08.14]Man, I tried to warn you.
[174:09.32]Now I'm gonna eat your face, right?
[174:11.62]So don't expect me to feel guilty.
[174:17.42]When they have to clean you off the floor.
[174:20.21]Hey, wanna see what happens to traitors?
[174:23.89]Uh...
[174:31.37]They get crushed.
[174:33.13]I'm killing this person right now.
[174:35.35]I can't do anything about it.
[174:36.19]Should I get hurt?
[174:38.62]I'm gonna let him kill me.
[174:40.42]If you don't get out of the way, I'll kill you.
[174:56.93]No!
[174:57.31]I have to die.
[174:59.26]They spit- I'm- they're voiding me.
[175:01.86]Oh, come on.
[175:03.76]You missed idiot.
[175:12.15]I can't do it.
[175:12.87]It won't let me.
[175:15.91]Wait, why aren't you fighting back?
[175:27.41]You think I care if you just want to lie down and die.
[175:30.33]You're just making it easier for me.
[175:41.98]All right, that's enough.
[175:43.56]If you want to die so much, then die.
[175:51.30]Miss.
[175:54.70]Susie?
[175:56.16]You missed.
[176:00.18]I don't want to kill you, man.
[176:02.20]Just move, please.
[176:05.68]But if I let you guys go, then... Then you and my dad will fight.
[176:12.07]And you'll kill each other.
[176:13.73]A lot of dot dot dots I've noticed in this game.
[176:19.87]At least if you stay here, neither of you will get hurt.
[176:24.09]Well, that's a real creepy serial killer way to look at it.
[176:28.09]If I just lock you in my basement forever, then you'll never be hurt.
[176:31.35]And I can take care of you.
[176:35.71]Then I... I won't kill him.
[176:39.15]Promise.
[176:41.87]Me and him will just talk it out.
[176:44.33]Peaceful style, you know?
[176:48.48]I don't think my dad would like that.
[176:52.00]Hey, Lancey, come on.
[176:53.44]We're a team, right?
[176:55.18]Nothing can stop us.
[176:56.00]Fighting or not, all right?
[176:59.54]Yeah!
[177:00.44]Yeah, you're right.
[177:02.22]We might as well try.
[177:03.24]I could help too.
[177:05.11]I'll go talk to my dad.
[177:06.53]Ripen him up.
[177:08.63]Hey, now we're getting somewhere.
[177:11.35]I'll head over right now.
[177:16.13]Suzy?
[177:20.31]Are... Are we still friends?
[177:25.70]Of course.
[177:26.66]I mean, if you want to be.
[177:29.13]Whew, see you!
[177:32.97]How am I going to get past his dad like that?
[177:35.59]Come on, I'll figure something out.
[177:41.23]So that's why, okay, Chris?
[177:45.01]He found your way over here, apparently.
[177:46.61]Hey.
[177:49.59]Hey, Susie, you came to save us.
[177:51.00]I knew you had the heart of a hero, Susie.
[177:53.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't push your luck.
[177:56.62]Chris and Rousey join the party.
[178:01.64]Chad Lancer wins by not moving a muscle.
[178:06.61]So what was even over here?
[178:11.19]Anything that I can look at?
[178:12.11]I mean, there's this guy.
[178:15.17]Yeah, even I got arrested.
[178:16.55]And I'm just a pair of eyes.
[178:17.95]What's the world coming to?
[178:27.94]Save point.
[178:31.11]Card Castle Prison.
[178:32.03]We could go up.
[178:34.33]Is this open?
[178:35.13]I guess so.
[178:36.81]Wait, I want to look at the other way.
[178:37.71]This lift should take us out of here.
[178:42.67]Oh.
[178:43.93]Now it might take a while, so... Let's chat.
[178:47.50]Get comfy, everyone.
[178:55.44]Hey, Rousey.
[178:56.28]You know Lancer's dad, the king?
[178:59.76]When we meet him, you think we'll have to hurt him?
[179:06.20]I mean, I could easily smash him, but you guys, I know that's not really your thing.
[179:11.19]You're more about groveling like total losers.
[179:18.07]Classic RPG elevator scene, that's right.
[179:21.87]And I was thinking maybe I could do that too.
[179:26.06]Susie, you mean you want to try acting?
[179:27.72]Uh, well, Susie, we'd be happy if you acted with us.
[179:32.24]And don't worry, we'll be there to help you.
[179:33.92]You won't have to figure it out by yourself.
[179:38.10]Sure.
[179:38.66]Okay.
[179:40.44]She's gonna die.
[179:41.90]I already... I mean... I made this, you know what I mean?
[179:48.28]Like, she's dead.
[179:48.94]Like, she's gonna... I know the whole story at this point.
[179:52.13]Hey, Rousey!
[179:54.03]Uh, Susie, are you still gonna make those cakes?
[179:59.83]No, I made this.
[180:01.63]Well, will you stop making fun of me?
[180:04.37]Well, if I have to, I guess.
[180:06.11]And I'll bake you as many as you like, alright?
[180:10.22]Yeah, like you can make that many.
[180:11.70]Dude!
[180:18.22]Well, this is our stop.
[180:21.59]I just went to school.
[180:23.55]That's the only thing I did this morning, right?
[180:25.71]Hey, Chris, wait a sec.
[180:26.35]You know, I'm starting to realize right now that I am a Fraggle Rock character.
[180:37.66]Took me a long time, about three hours to figure that out, but I am one of the main characters from Fraggle Rock.
[180:45.21]It'll be easier for us to get out of here if we all get along a little more.
[180:52.10]So, next time we fight an enemy... If you tell me what to do, I'll listen to you.
[180:56.82]Well... But, you know, don't tell me anything stupid.
[181:02.19]Or I'll go back to smashing heads, alright?
[181:07.74]Chris, I'm counting on you.
[181:09.48]Dude.
[181:11.26]Susie, join the party for real.
[181:30.75]Yeah, there's like real creepy clown music here.
[181:32.52]Nice to meet you, I'm Rousey, this is Chris, and... So what the hell are you doing in there?
[181:56.55]I'm innocent, innocent.
[181:59.01]I just wanted to play a game, a game.
[182:02.15]But the boring kings found such fun to be trouble as punishment they craved to imprison my body.
[182:10.04]But I'm fast, fast and clever, very clever.
[182:12.46]They lost the chase and locked up their entire race.
[182:16.44]Building a prison around the whole world, now I'm the only free one.
[182:21.54]Free, but you're clearly the one behind bars.
[182:25.02]Things don't seem such from here, Lightners.
[182:27.22]Sounds like you don't need any help then.
[182:30.28]That is unso.
[182:32.72]I grow lonely in my little freedom.
[182:34.96]So shall you play a game with me?
[182:36.75]Me?
[182:37.31]Me?
[182:37.47]I'll show you what it means to be free.
[182:43.31]Find the key and I'll let you be free.
[182:45.13]Free!
[182:45.79]The key is hidden from the eyes.
[182:47.27]The old shopkeeper knows a secret.
[182:49.51]Tear them from his skull.
[182:54.06]Okay.
[182:56.04]What?
[182:57.72]The key is hidden from the eyes.
[183:01.38]The old shopkeeper knows a secret.
[183:08.33]Shopkeeper.
[183:08.81]He knows a secret.
[183:09.39]Let's go talk to the shopkeeper.
[183:14.81]Where the fuck was that guy?
[183:17.63]Alright.
[183:18.11]First floor.
[183:24.33]Wait, this is... Hold on.
[183:27.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[183:34.11]Prison B1.
[183:34.61]So let me just get out of here.
[183:51.51]Eyes.
[184:01.21]How do I get out?
[184:01.69]How do I leave?
[184:02.89]Thanks for inviting me.
[184:03.59]This trash can's really great.
[184:10.43]Sorry, I wasn't progressing when I was going to the first floor.
[184:17.34]Exit through the prison.
[184:18.70]I'm gonna just go to the prison and get out.
[184:23.06]There's multiple exits.
[184:24.86]I wanted to go this way, though.
[184:27.61]Oh, God.
[184:34.05]Us animals used to be alone in these cages, now everyone's here.
[184:37.31]So many new people wish we could go back to the good old days, when it was just us in these filthy cages.
[184:45.98]Since I didn't want to fight you guys, I got locked up.
[184:48.72]How can I?
[184:49.28]You guys seem way nicer than the king.
[184:50.86]I was arrested for making a puzzle without a license.
[184:55.84]I'll never make another word search, I promise.
[185:00.69]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[185:01.97]Are the three former kings.
[185:03.40]We are the three former kings.
[185:04.64]We beg you, free us.
[185:06.82]Once all four of us ruled together, but when the night arrived, everything changed.
[185:10.86]Oh, my diamonds, my jewels.
[185:11.98]You must tell me if they're all right.
[185:14.56]Oh.
[185:14.72]Oh.
[185:16.20]Okay.
[185:19.86]Okay.
[185:27.43]So, first floor.
[185:28.71]Go to the shopkeeper.
[185:29.65]Where's the shopkeeper?
[185:40.03]Am I going the right way?
[185:42.23]Okay, I'm in the front.
[185:42.93]I'm right at the front door.
[185:45.39]There we go.
[185:45.91]Alright.
[185:47.43]It's a door.
[185:47.89]Where will you go?
[185:49.49]Where was... It wasn't the bake sale.
[185:54.92]It wasn't the bake sale.
[186:02.61]There it is.
[186:03.09]Okay.
[186:04.79]So, you got a secret.
[186:06.23]Start talking.
[186:08.95]Strange prisoner.
[186:09.87]What are you talking about?
[186:12.22]A prisoner with an odd manner?
[186:14.76]No, you couldn't possibly be talking about him.
[186:18.20]I see.
[186:18.56]After all the trouble I went through to lock him up, you want to release him.
[186:23.64]Now that you mention it, it could be troublesome if he was left alone.
[186:27.04]Yes, perhaps it's better if you heroes dealt with him now.
[186:30.04]After all, it's not as if whatever happens will matter in the end.
[186:33.79]Perhaps a little chaos might be fun.
[186:36.43]So then, take this.
[186:38.01]Broken Key A was added to your key items.
[186:41.33]If you're so driven, find the other two pieces and get someone to fix them.
[186:45.77]I'll even give you a hint.
[186:46.81]Walk where the stars don't shine.
[186:50.25]If you succeed, come back here and tell me.
[186:52.35]Good luck.
[186:54.47]You can call this luck.
[186:55.45]No, it's more like a curse.
[186:58.45]Where the star... Okay.
[187:00.83]Doesn't matter to me, but here's a... Walk where the stars don't shine.
[187:13.65]Where the stars don't shine.
[187:15.23]I mean, that's... He's talking about darkness.
[187:26.83]Is this the way that it was?
[187:28.43]Oh, you dickhead.
[187:32.37]Just kill him.
[187:32.99]No, don't, don't, don't.
[187:45.46]I can't.
[187:47.32]I can't get any bad stuff.
[187:48.96]I want to do the good playthrough.
[188:02.81]I'm already on the bad playthrough?
[188:04.37]What are you talking about?
[188:05.15]How am I on the bo- How?
[188:14.94]Oh my god.
[188:32.70]Your choices don't matter.
[188:34.80]Well, I guess that's true.
[188:43.87]That is true.
[188:48.63]Alright, somebody really badly wants me to do this, and it's probably a spoiler.
[188:53.81]But, you know.
[188:55.03]What am I gonna do?
[188:56.79]Item.
[188:57.71]Use.
[188:58.57]Uh...
[189:10.55]Okay, doesn't seem to be working what the hell is that?
[189:18.61]All right, where here's the hint where the sun don't shine or something, right?
[189:22.82]Nice dial-up
[189:41.31]Check up?
[189:42.55]What are you talking about?
[189:43.65]What?
[189:51.80]Uh, this way?
[189:52.52]I mean, this is the... Oh, shit.
[190:01.16]Check ass.
[190:05.37]Rival?
[190:07.65]What does that mean?
[190:27.70]Let me show you my salt and pepper shakers.
[190:32.43]Watch out now.
[190:42.49]Re-range, re-range, re-range, SPARE!
[190:51.83]So I gotta get two broken keys.
[190:57.37]Alright, here we go.
[190:59.85]I see where the stars don't shine.
[191:03.69]So where are those stars not shining?
[191:05.63]I mean, it looks like I can go over here.
[191:13.66]What is in there?
[191:14.16]There's probably a broken key in there.
[191:20.34]Got it.
[191:22.93]Where the stars don't shine.
[191:33.98]Let's do a Breathe All.
[191:35.36]You can get him to spare any of them.
[191:39.36]It doesn't really matter who.
[191:42.80]A sweet and fresh girl, a soft and clean boy.
[191:54.35]No, no, you spared the wrong one, dude.
[191:56.15]$115, that's a lot of money.
[192:04.73]Alright, broken key.
[192:08.15]It's definitely right here.
[192:11.14]You open the treasure chest, inside was broken key B. You put broken key B in your item inventory.
[192:16.78]Alright, I need another clue.
[192:19.66]How do I get another hint?
[192:21.88]Talk to him again?
[192:49.98]Why does this game not have a run button?
[192:52.54]Um, it does.
[192:54.70]See?
[192:55.32]This is not running.
[192:57.02]This is running.
[193:06.01]Oh, he means a run from combat.
[193:09.15]Did Undertale have a run from combat?
[193:11.89]I think it did.
[193:17.24]Yeah, flee.
[193:21.81]All right, let's talk to the shopkeeper.
[193:22.95]Like I said, there are no random encounters, so that makes sense.
[193:30.53]They took the kind of Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG aspect of encounters where you actually have to touch them, so... All right, so now let's go back to the door.
[193:52.93]Uh, field.
[193:53.93]Alright, tell me where the other thing is.
[194:01.08]Talk!
[194:03.74]From opening the door?
[194:05.44]Uh, well, it doesn't matter.
[194:06.66]Walk where the stars don't shine.
[194:09.98]Uh... Does he not have another hint for me?
[194:25.11]Take your time.
[194:25.85]Ain't like it's better spent.
[194:27.08]It doesn't have another hint.
[194:32.10]Can I examine the keys?
[194:38.62]Okay.
[194:39.32]It's the top part of a key.
[194:40.46]A smith could fix all three parts.
[194:42.70]It's the middle part of a key.
[194:43.74]A smith could fix all three parts.
[194:49.68]All right.
[195:01.48]I do have the cake.
[195:02.56]This song is good.
[195:03.60]Uh, this is just here.
[195:04.68]I have no fucking idea.
[195:05.70]Check ass!
[195:39.62]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:41.32]Order of rooms in the card castle.
[195:44.81]Um... No, wait a minute.
[195:48.93]Oh, shit.
[195:50.93]How the fuck... We've been in the card castle.
[196:02.10]Oh, there it is!
[196:02.82]It's definitely right there!
[196:09.88]I have to go to the card castle to look at this?
[196:11.68]There's only 24 different possible outcomes.
[196:27.85]Everyone's just writing the solution.
[196:30.83]Oh, man!
[196:33.11]What the heck?
[196:34.01]Everyone's writing the solution!
[196:37.60]What the?
[196:39.64]I saw it!
[196:46.25]I've already seen it.
[196:47.49]I can't go back.
[196:48.61]I've already seen it!
[196:55.97]Well, shit.
[196:56.81]I mean, what was it again?
[196:57.91]I saw it already here.
[196:59.85]Somebody put it in there.
[197:14.73]I really wish I didn't see that.
[197:57.83]Oh, that's... I'm so not fun.
[198:01.37]And, like, somebody wrote it, and I saw it, and what was I supposed to do?
[198:05.03]Be like, no, you know, I definitely don't see the wave of the solution.
[198:09.00]I mean, what did that person say?
[198:10.02]Check ass?
[198:10.72]Oh, wow.
[198:11.24]In between that was ten messages saying the solution, and below that was ten messages saying check his ass.
[198:19.51]What, am I going to pretend like I'm not seeing it?
[198:24.56]Alright, now we have to go where the blacksmith, the guy that can fix stuff.
[198:28.10]I think he's, isn't he around here?
[198:28.99]Uh, where is that guy?
[198:34.57]I think he's at the bake sale.
[198:35.53]Because he was up, right?
[198:43.77]Yes.
[198:44.25]Alright, fix this!
[198:47.46]Fix item?
[198:48.82]That key is something with energy.
[198:50.10]You must let me fix it.
[198:51.92]Let's feel my technique.
[199:01.87]Twitch plays Deltarune.
[199:03.11]That's the only one I looked at.
[199:04.35]This key has terrible energy coming out of it.
[199:07.91]Please understand that I only fixed it so that you will never have to use it.
[199:11.49]Okay.
[199:13.69]Alright, so do I need to go back to the shopkeeper or is he going to be like... I'm going to go back to the shopkeeper and I'm going to get gnomed.
[199:40.71]Alright, shopkeeper.
[199:41.49]You got anything to say?
[199:43.65]Talk.
[199:45.07]Trouble opening the door.
[199:46.18]Alright, I need to see if we got burgers.
[199:55.26]I got so much money.
[199:57.56]You're carrying too much.
[200:04.38]I'm gonna sell.
[200:05.06]Sell armor.
[200:07.07]No, I got... Hold on.
[200:07.75]Wait.

[200:10.33]I got the glow shard, man.
[200:11.53]What do I do with this thing?
[200:14.45]Return the cake.
[200:16.05]I'll return the cake.
[200:16.73]Where's Mr. Cake Man?
[200:17.65]He's like over here, right?
[200:20.48]No.
[200:21.78]Those are the puzzle power ranges.
[200:39.25]Don't return cake.
[200:41.39]Eat cake.
[200:42.63]Give cake.
[200:43.99]Put cake up S. What else should I do?
[200:50.20]Return cake.
[200:51.02]Eat cake.

[201:12.33]I'm gonna be fine.
[201:13.03]Don't worry.
[201:20.41]Castle.
[201:26.39]Let's go.
[201:27.09]Let's open up the door.
[201:28.77]Let the guy out.
[201:33.23]No!
[201:33.73]I don't want to fight him!
[201:38.91]Compliment.
[201:43.01]And... No, don't spare yet.
[201:44.91]Defend.
[201:46.15]Told Susie to compliment the enemy.
[201:48.43]Uh, are you serious?
[201:49.85]What good can I say about someone trying to kill us?
[201:51.49]Aw Susie, if you're stuck, why not try saying something you wish somebody'd say to you?
[201:57.82]You are unbanned from free ham sandwich day.
[202:01.82]No one has said that to me before.
[202:03.16]Long live the king.
[202:11.43]Smells like crystals.
[202:14.33]And, uh... Whatever.
[202:20.38]I can't really do anything here.
[202:26.12]Perish, Lightners!
[202:34.30]Unbanned from Jerma's Discord.
[202:42.24]Nice, you guys look like you're gonna kill me.
[202:50.05]Unbanned.
[202:50.67]Alright, here we go.
[202:53.07]Wait, I'll save it here.
[202:57.93]Where will you go?
[202:58.95]Down here.
[202:59.47]Let's go talk to the clown again.
[203:12.11]Hey, I'm back.
[203:13.73]Oh, the key, the key.
[203:14.87]A marvelous fun is about to break free.
[203:17.43]Won't you let yourself outside?
[203:18.75]Sure.
[203:21.44]You put the door key in front of the door.
[203:26.04]The door key created a door.
[203:27.24]Okay, there's Mr. Clown.
[203:37.13]Visitors, visitors, now we can play.
[203:39.81]Then after you, I can play with everyone else too.
[203:43.21]So what are we playing exactly?
[203:45.21]Oh, it's just a simple numbers game.
[203:49.61]When your HP drops to zero, you lose.
[203:52.61]So that's the kind of game you want to play.
[203:54.55]Then I gotta warn you.
[203:58.19]You're dealing with a couple of sharks.
[204:01.74]Shark to shark, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[204:04.26]Now, now, let the games begin.
[204:08.01]All right, uh, Jevil.
[204:13.18]Uh, check.
[204:17.52]Hypnosis.
[204:18.84]Peer away.
[204:19.70]All right, I think I'm gonna... Let's check.
[204:26.79]I'm gonna defend.
[204:27.53]I want some points here.
[204:30.93]There is no strategy to beat the enemy.
[204:32.81]Good luck.
[204:35.89]Chaos, chaos.
[204:36.89]Catch me if you can.
[204:45.64]Smells like chaos.
[204:47.38]It sure does.
[204:48.12]Alright, we got... Peered away.
[204:49.65]Defend.
[204:52.43]Defend.
[204:54.97]First spun around, Jevil got slightly more tired, and... Jevil felt at ease.
[204:59.15]Jevil's defense dropped.
[205:01.57]Shall we play the ring around?
[205:06.01]Oh my lord.
[205:12.40]Whoa!
[205:13.98]Alright.
[205:18.51]Well, uh Can I look at the manual Revivement Okay, I'm back my hearts go all out to all you sinners
[205:47.97]I gotta spend these.
[205:48.79]I gotta do some healing here.
[205:51.47]Okay, act.
[205:54.77]Hypnosis.
[205:57.11]So as he spun something around, Jevil's next attack weakened and Jevil became more tired.
[206:01.45]Let's make the Devil's Knife.
[206:04.13]Oh my goodness.
[206:13.29]The world is spinning.
[206:16.06]We got another person dead.
[206:22.00]Look at the items.
[206:25.60]Nice armor.
[206:27.66]I didn't know that I was gonna fight, like, the secret boss back here.
[206:30.90]Um, I wanna see his... No, we're both fine.
[206:45.65]What?
[206:45.85]It's nothing but a useless bird.
[206:48.33]Plip, plip, let's ride the carousel.
[206:58.47]I can do anything.
[207:02.13]Okay.
[207:04.21]Uh, give me a burger.
[207:07.29]And then... What do you got for magic?
[207:09.98]Pacify.
[207:10.82]He's not tired enough.
[207:12.76]Heal player.
[207:13.58]Dammit.
[207:18.48]Just defend.
[207:19.36]Alright, I just gotta not get hit.
[207:21.84]You having fun?

[207:36.21]I need 50%.
[207:36.49]Oh.
[207:36.73]I need to be tired.
[207:43.46]Heal player... Can I bring Susie back?
[207:50.31]Slightly more tired.
[207:51.77]Everyone's HP got jumbled up.
[207:53.63]Oh, shit.
[207:57.70]Hearts, diamonds, I can do anything!
[208:07.45]Jevil's laughing incomprehensibly.
[208:09.27]Okay.
[208:10.71]Still not tired enough.
[208:16.72]Rude Buster?
[208:22.52]Laughing incomprehensibly.
[208:44.43]Slutting Mortar, and... upcoming move got powered up.
[208:48.29]We keep spinning the world around.
[208:58.28]Feels like a whirlwind.
[208:59.76]Fuck.
[209:03.66]Should I, like, fucking hit him?
[209:14.82]Dark Burger for... Suzy.
[209:24.75]If I give this to Rousey, she won't be revived though, right?
[209:41.13]Oh shit, okay, nice.
[209:43.31]Alright, everyone's alive.
[209:44.67]Okay, no hit!
[209:54.22]Got it.
[209:55.34]Get fucking out of here.
[209:56.14]Hypnosis.
[209:58.62]Jevil's next attack weakened.
[209:59.58]Jevil became more tired.
[210:01.26]You kids are really keeping up.
[210:08.70]Holy shit, this is fucking insane.
[210:10.36]Okay.
[210:10.65]Feels like a whirlwind.
[210:12.91]We're still all up.
[210:13.91]Do it again.
[210:16.33]Jevil's next attack weakened.
[210:17.19]He became more tired.
[210:18.75]I never had such fun.
[210:19.91]How you doing?
[210:31.80]Okay, I need to heal.
[210:37.61]Darkburger on... Rousey on Susie.

[210:48.59]Okay.

[211:06.33]No, I'm not going to use it yet.
[211:07.81]I still have Burgers.
[211:08.71]I'm going to give this to Chris.

[215:16.31]This is making me anxious.
[215:18.45]This is making me anxious!
[215:23.09]He doesn't... If I peer away here, and then defend, and then pacify... It's over, right?
[215:46.58]No, no, he's not tired.
[215:49.42]Look at him, he's really tired.
[215:54.82]Oh, I feel like I'm gonna fuck this up.

[217:02.26]Just pulling out all the stops.
[217:04.74]Act.
[217:05.94]Hypnotize.
[217:07.94]Hypnotize and then pacify.

[217:20.01]Hypnotize!
[217:21.30]Hypnotize!
[217:21.68]Do I get to win?
[217:49.56]I can pacify him now, right?

[218:00.14]Let me... I'm gonna just... I got a Heart's Donut.
[218:02.58]I'm gonna give it to... I'm gonna give it to Rousey.

[218:13.46]I don't have anything else.
[218:15.48]Rude Buster.
[218:16.34]I don't know what the fuck that does.
[218:24.95]Defend and then Magic Pacify Jevil.
[218:35.31]No, he's going to blow it.
[218:38.00]Wait, who did I just heal?
[218:39.28]I'm going to heal Frisk.
[218:44.28]Heal... Fuck me.
[218:49.94]I'm going to defend and then I'm going to heal...
[218:54.36]myself, Rousey.

[219:55.43]No!
[220:03.50]I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can...
[220:16.08]Did I crash the game?
[220:16.95]What happened?
[220:28.21]What fun!
[220:28.77]I'm exhausted!
[220:29.53]You kids tired me up!
[220:32.23]Now I will sleep for the other hundred years!
[220:37.44]Unfortunately, you kids cannot have such a pleasant dream!
[220:40.90]From now, a nightmare will awaken in your hearts!
[220:45.12]In the shadow of the knight's hand.
[220:49.34]Lightners, can you stop it?
[220:52.60]Either way, a mischief... I'm like on... I think I struck by lightning right there.
[220:58.98]That was stressful.
[221:01.05]Either way, a mischief, mischief, a chaos, chaos.
[221:04.33]Lightners, from inside your little cell.
[221:07.11]Take this and do your strongest.
[221:08.93]Uh, Jevilstail...
[221:14.27]was added to your armor.
[221:22.91]I got... I got it!
[221:24.07]I did it!
[221:28.35]Pocket falling coming in with five community subs.
[221:35.11]Thank you, pocket falling.
[221:38.82]It's too easy.
[221:39.96]That was... That was crazy.
[221:43.92]Well, there it is.
[221:44.40]I did it.
[221:47.76]Let's take a look at it.
[221:49.35]But pocket-polling five community subs.
[221:56.65]Yeah, that wasn't easy.
[221:59.61]So, it is who... It is a defense item?
[222:02.93]Alright, we got... Iron Sickle... Jevil's Tail.
[222:07.39]A J-shaped tail that gives you devil energy.
[222:12.24]Oh, damn.
[222:12.64]Plus three magic.
[222:13.56]That should go on... Yeah, that should go on Rousey.
[222:19.64]Oh, shit.
[222:21.64]Well... There it is.
[222:30.23]Oh, defense.
[222:31.69]Oh, give Iron Shackle to you.
[222:34.84]You need something.
[222:36.48]You can't wear that.
[222:38.38]Can you... You can wear this.
[222:41.47]And you can wear that.
[222:42.52]Now everybody's got something on.
[222:48.82]Okay.
[222:52.06]And I only have $1100.
[222:52.74]Save it.
[222:53.34]Oh my god.
[222:59.58]Oh my god.
[223:00.70]Kairi Tobi.
[223:02.07]Kairi Tobi coming in with... 20.
[223:06.77]20 community subs.
[223:09.95]Holy shit.
[223:15.86]My god.
[223:18.18]Oh wait- Very generous of you, thank you.
[223:25.01]A ton of subs are coming in here.
[223:29.93]Thank- You guys are fucking awesome, thank you.
[223:32.35]Topek.
[223:41.32]You guys are fucking amazing.
[223:48.14]You beat Jevil first.
[223:49.38]You deserve it.
[223:55.06]I don't know, man.
[223:57.55]That was really close.
[224:00.13]At the very end, I thought it was over.
[224:04.47]I got so lucky that that was the last time.
[224:07.20]I'm not sure I could have gone one more round there.
[224:08.72]I really don't think so.
[224:16.40]So now I need to go to the first floor and continue going.
[224:27.98]Beats Jevil first try, loses to Pinwood.
[224:31.50]He's insane.
[224:33.62]I beat Pin... Whatever.
[224:35.08]I didn't... That's... Stop with this...
[224:39.76]People are starting to believe that.
[224:41.30]You know, look, let me tell you something.
[224:43.36]I've gone to, like, Reddit threads before.
[224:45.24]Have I talked about this?
[224:46.27]I probably have, but I need to reiterate it again.
[224:49.41]People will go on, like, there'll be, like, a Reddit post or... Oh, look, there's a clip of something that Jerva said or did.
[224:56.41]Oh, okay, whatever.
[224:56.93]And, like, halfway down with, like, 25 upvotes is... Oh, it's, like, kind of unfortunate because this guy, like, died to fucking pinwheel.
[225:03.48]And, like, people that don't even know this stream...
[225:05.86]will reply and be like, are you fucking serious?
[225:08.80]This guy sucks.
[225:09.72]Like, holy shit.
[225:10.46]No, there's no way.
[225:11.84]And then you keep up the act.
[225:13.08]No, dude, it was embarrassing.
[225:14.60]He got really mad.
[225:15.50]And like, that's why I don't watch him.
[225:16.80]And it's just like, what the fuck?
[225:19.38]I can't even like defend myself.
[225:23.64]How am I supposed to like defend that?
[225:31.12]But you did die.
[225:31.96]I did not die in a pinwheel.
[225:34.48]We will sit here and watch that unedited entire VOD.
[225:41.46]This is Rudin's room.
[225:42.45]Yes, that's a door.
[225:46.11]Jewels?
[225:46.79]Coins?
[225:47.89]Almost everyday riches acquired from a legitimate source.
[225:52.62]What's this?
[225:53.40]Looks like a family photograph.
[226:00.42]We sold all of our beds to replace them with treasure.
[226:02.72]My back hurts, but life has never been better.
[226:04.38]That's good.
[226:06.92]Hey, you're that chump that beat me up earlier.
[226:10.02]There's no way I'll forgive you, so scram.
[226:16.59]We're so sorry.
[226:17.25]We made a mistake earlier.
[226:18.41]We promise we won't do it again.
[226:20.93]Oh, you're apologizing.
[226:22.29]I guess I'll forgive you then.
[226:23.75]Your violence against a single Rudin was forgiven.
[226:31.27]I can talk to the shopkeeper.
[226:36.27]Google, uh... He did say to come back.
[226:42.05]What am I doing here?
[226:43.21]I'm already on this floor.
[226:44.75]You're there.
[226:46.85]Um... So here's... I have a question.
[226:49.57]Because this is not the whole game, right?
[226:51.74]This is kind of, like, part one or something?
[226:55.66]Am I, like, participating in the beta, or do I get to keep my fucking Jevil item for, like, when the next part comes out?
[227:02.68]Or am I gonna get, like, a thank you for participating?
[227:05.40]In, like, the beta, your characters are wiped.
[227:08.48]Okay, okay, good, good.
[227:09.93]I'm just making sure.
[227:10.73]Because I don't know if I can do that again.
[227:14.65]Nobody knows?
[227:15.37]Oh god.
[227:17.51]Uh, where am I going?
[227:18.17]Over here.
[227:25.16]Uh, field, right?
[227:31.62]Let's see the lore.
[227:33.10]Talk.
[227:34.26]About?
[227:35.30]We won.
[227:36.10]Alright, we won.
[227:38.86]You defeated him?
[227:39.74]You really defeated him.
[227:41.78]I see.
[227:42.08]Perhaps you three may truly be heroes after all.
[227:45.14]The Jevil was just a taste of what you'll face from now on.
[227:48.02]One day soon, you too will begin to realize the futility of your actions.
[227:53.42]Ha ha ha.
[227:54.60]At that time, feel free to come back here.
[227:56.24]I'll make you tea.
[227:57.86]And we can toast to the end of the world.
[228:02.01]Damn.
[228:04.45]He was a funny little man, once the court jester, I the court magician.
[228:08.86]A friend?
[228:09.88]Could I consider him a friend?
[228:11.48]Perhaps not.
[228:12.68]But he was the only one who matched me in the games we used to play.
[228:16.74]One day he met a strange someone, and since then he began to change.
[228:19.50]He started saying bizarre things that didn't completely make sense, but didn't completely not make sense either.
[228:27.11]Soon he began to see the world as a game and everyone as its participants.
[228:31.91]As the court mage and his only companion, I was forced to lock him away, or rather lock us all away, in his own words.
[228:40.46]Since that time, the strange words he said have stuck inside my cotton, and my view of this world has become darker yet darker.
[228:48.04]Reflecting on these old memories, I think perhaps I miss playing games with him, and I wonder if I hadn't been asked to lock him up, would I have found a little more purpose in my life?
[229:01.65]Wow.
[229:03.55]Okay.
[229:06.25]Interesting.
[229:11.65]Greetings from Japan!
[229:13.03]Hope everyone's doing well, hey.
[229:15.11]How are you?
[229:15.95]Greetings.
[229:16.53]Uh, I need to buy some stuff, because I ran out.
[229:25.00]Why did I buy a cannon?
[229:31.67]Toby admitted that this demo is all he had, but he has storyboards ready.
[229:37.09]Well, that means it's free.
[229:40.43]Right?
[229:44.54]The game's free, so.
[229:52.82]He just wrote the story.
[229:55.48]Uh, well, whatever.
[229:59.16]However long it takes.
[230:00.68]I know I've got my court jester item.
[230:03.84]This reminds me not to delete this.
[230:17.06]Alright, I need to go back to the castle.
[230:21.16]Okay.
[230:28.12]Check ass.
[230:30.25]I gotta stop reading those.
[230:32.95]Alright, let's go up into the Game Boy room.
[230:42.21]Oh, that's blocked off.
[230:50.25]What's this?
[230:54.34]Uh... So the worms have decided to crawl out and play.
[231:00.16]Who's there?
[231:00.64]It's Jevil!
[231:07.13]I am Ruz'kar, thou greatest adversary.
[231:10.63]Thou may have clawedest past all thou otherest conundrums, but thou'st were created by utter weaklings.
[231:17.43]Now prepare thou'self for the strongest puzzle of thou'st life, toilworms.
[231:30.20]Okay, so if I...
[231:36.85]If I stand as sheep, I don't understand.
[231:38.23]If I stand as sheep pushes, would that work?
[231:45.11]Joke, joke, joke.
[231:46.55]God damn it.
[231:47.75]That's it?
[231:59.10]God damn it.
[232:00.30]And that's it.
[232:02.37]God... damn it.
[232:06.41]Is this door open though?
[232:07.67]It is.
[232:08.31]Hold on, let's see what's down here.
[232:16.28]You opened the treasure chest.
[232:17.50]Inside was club sandwich.
[232:20.46]You put club sandwich in your items.
[232:25.06]I got too many burgers.
[232:26.54]Club sandwich.
[232:27.96]A sandwich that can be split into three.
[232:29.81]He has 30 HP to the team.
[232:33.72]Okay.
[232:36.50]Castle Bathroom Royal Flush currently occupied.
[232:40.38]That's cute.
[232:43.93]Throw the manual away from War Room, but what if I need to know how to press A?
[232:51.07]Let's go left first.
[233:01.65]Head Hathy blocked away quietly times three.
[233:04.65]Alright, we got... Uh, flirt.
[233:09.87]And... Order Susie to flirt with the enemy.
[233:16.15]And hell no.
[233:17.87]Aw Susie, it's okay if you don't know how.
[233:20.59]What?
[233:20.93]Shut up.
[233:21.25]That's not the problem.
[233:22.14]Are you sure?
[233:24.94]Alright, look.
[233:25.72]Wise guy.
[233:26.44]I'll show you.
[233:27.00]Watch this.
[233:31.42]So, uh, come here often?
[233:35.53]Ted Hathy felt awkward and left.
[233:38.35]Hey, get back here and let me flirt with you!
[233:50.49]It smells like a lonely kiss.
[233:51.67]What the hell does that mean?
[233:53.83]Let's do it again.
[233:57.11]He won't excuse you to flirt with the enemy.
[233:59.58]Come on, let's see Rousey do it.
[234:01.82]I suppose it can't be helped.
[234:04.10]Hattie, your beauty is just transcendent.
[234:06.28]Your hair is like a waterfall of... Wait, do you have hair, or... Hattie felt awkward enough.
[234:14.37]Oh dear, oh.
[234:15.31]Wait.
[234:16.47]That's so easy.
[234:22.34]Oh, whoa, I didn't know you moved.
[234:23.62]Okay, that's annoying.
[234:26.12]Headhathy's mind is an enigma.
[234:27.26]All right, we're going to do a double flirt.
[234:35.71]Oh my god, Chris, I can't... Do it yourself.
[234:38.57]You said some sweet lines, the enemies were deeply enamored.
[234:42.60]Oh, that's all it took.
[234:52.21]Spare to hit happen.
[234:57.18]Now that you beat Jevil, you are entitled to never get hurt from now on.
[235:01.12]Oh, that's not going to happen.
[235:02.32]I'm going to get hit by the easiest thing in the game.
[235:09.18]Let's go.
[235:10.50]It stuck its tongue out at me.
[235:14.39]What if I do them all?
[235:16.29]Yep, okay.
[235:18.99]That was a pretty good Nickelodeon sound effect.
[235:20.67]Oh, come on.
[235:23.67]Alright, fine.
[235:24.65]I'll play along.
[235:28.62]Did I get them all?
[235:29.22]Because all the tongues are out.
[235:30.68]I mean... Here we go again.
[235:44.49]There you are!
[235:47.67]Yeah, those guys really think it was all I had.
[235:50.03]Have had you.
[236:16.17]Ah!
[236:17.27]Ah!
[236:18.39]Gullible worms.
[236:19.25]That wasn't real, my ultimate puzzle.
[236:21.19]I have a way better one right here.
[236:24.12]Can we see it?
[236:24.92]No.
[236:33.94]No.
[236:36.34]Inside was a revived mint that you were carrying too many items.
[236:39.69]No.
[236:47.03]Yeah, throw it away.
[236:48.29]You dropped the manual on the floor with a resounding thud.
[236:50.89]Hey, Chris, what are you doing?
[236:53.33]Oh no, is that the manual?
[237:01.13]Well, I wasn't supposed to do that.
[237:02.87]Looks like you accidentally dropped it.
[237:04.51]Here you go, Chris.
[237:05.43]You don't want to lose that.
[237:07.21]You got the manual again.
[237:08.37]So, am I...
[237:15.66]What is in the manual?
[237:17.04]A handmade book full of various tips and tricks.
[237:20.48]You tried to read the manual, but it was so dense it made your head spin.
[237:42.71]You can toss the manual hard.
[237:44.09]Its pages scatter in the wind.
[237:50.68]That's okay, Chris.
[237:51.58]I can always... I'll just make a better one next time.
[237:56.66]Just smash it into the ground.
[237:58.48]I don't want... I don't need that.
[238:01.81]I need the revivement.
[238:14.90]Okay, we got two.
[238:16.52]We got a shop.
[238:19.20]What is this?
[238:21.08]There's salsa buried in the ground here.
[238:24.06]Oh, this is the... This is Lancer's room.
[238:26.69]You found 20 rupees in the hole.
[238:28.73]Unfortunately, that's not a useful currency here.
[238:32.53]It's a hole made of... It's a hole made recreationally.
[238:37.18]It's a hole, presumably dug for fun.
[238:40.19]It's some kind of digging implement.
[238:43.09]And... It's a music player.
[238:45.17]Listen to the contents of the music player.
[238:48.56]Yeah.
[238:50.74]It's full of cartoon splat noises.
[238:55.60]Okay.
[239:06.87]A bicycle is lovingly tucked into bed.
[239:12.57]Okay.
[239:14.73]Let's go to the shop.
[239:16.97]Welcome to my shop, you ungrateful worms.
[239:23.84]Oh, what is thine interest?
[239:27.72]I am the Duke of Puzzles, rules card.
[239:31.31]My hobbies include calligraphy, law keeping, bug keeping.
[239:34.43]Okay, I already like them.
[239:36.33]Bug keeping cages.
[239:37.97]and long walks in the dungeon.
[239:40.31]Artest thou one of my admirers, Worm?
[239:44.65]Uh, why are you selling to us?
[239:46.66]So I might amasseth funds, Worms, an army of funds, so that I may crushest thou like fermented grapes into a most delicious and adult beverage.
[239:58.18]Vengeance.
[240:00.04]Oh, how I amuse myself.
[240:07.77]Our Lord King art a cruel and terrifying monarch.
[240:11.29]However, he is also brilliant, for he decidedesteth to appoint me as Duke of Puzzles, after pretty mucheth everyone else was furdest or placed inside a cage.
[240:26.01]Truly a benevolent ruler.
[240:29.20]And his son, on the other hand, is more troublesome than a fistful of fleas.
[240:33.58]He always asks me the worst queries, and calleth me his lesser dad.
[240:40.75]Our relation is none, you little water beetle.
[240:43.87]I placate you for your father's sake.
[240:46.89]I do not wisheth to hear your MP3s.
[240:49.54]I would rather listen to the sweet song of death.
[240:52.90]How is he, anyhow?
[240:54.68]Alright, well, what do we got?
[241:00.67]Uh, that's... Brave Axe.
[241:05.98]Rules, rules.
[241:06.84]Item, Fragrant Sauce.
[241:13.94]Who's even... Does anybody even have this on?
[241:15.50]I don't think I need anything.
[241:22.03]I have a lot of healing.
[241:24.39]It's worse than the burger anyways.
[241:28.93]No, I'm good.
[241:29.43]I'm good.
[241:29.75]I think I'm ready to go.
[241:33.76]What item?
[241:34.32]What does this do, though?
[241:35.10]I don't know what this shard does.
[241:37.16]A Revivement is 200 bucks?
[241:40.70]Okay.
[241:58.56]Brave Axe.
[241:59.19]I wonder if I should just get him a new weapon.
[242:00.71]But he's... I'm not gonna... I'm trying to do the, uh, axe stuff.
[242:07.51]Healing up.
[242:09.79]Um... Yeah.
[242:17.38]See you in the dungeon!
[242:18.06]Let me take a look here.
[242:22.56]Because... You have the... the Jevil item.
[242:33.68]Wait, hold on.
[242:34.26]Oh, it's a weapon!
[242:37.40]I thought it was a... Okay.
[242:41.72]Well, nobody else can even use this shit, so... This thing... A rugged scarf that cuts enemies like a dagger.
[242:48.59]A basic scarf made of lightning.
[242:50.57]Okay, I'm gonna sell both of these.
[242:55.11]He is decked out.
[242:56.69]He's got the best stuff on.
[242:58.49]Alright, so I'm gonna sell the red scarf and the rags.
[243:02.62]You also need some more armor.
[243:05.24]And get this piece of... You have wood.
[243:08.15]I don't want a wooden blade.
[243:09.99]Take it off.
[243:10.39]Yeah, okay.
[243:12.87]Hold on a minute.
[243:19.86]Get the axe.
[243:22.10]And... Another amber card.
[243:30.68]Now I have to take this off.
[243:31.76]I'm going to sell the stuff I just took off.
[243:37.17]What?
[243:39.45]Oh, right.
[243:40.59]Okay.
[243:44.15]That wasn't for you.
[243:44.91]That was not for you.
[243:45.91]Okay.
[243:48.17]Well, that's fine.
[243:50.09]Fulfiness up.
[243:54.10]Sell the stuff, and then let's go.
[243:56.56]Sell weapons.
[243:57.33]I want to sell the axe, the rag, the scarf.
[244:03.09]And I am ready to go.
[244:07.63]It's not really as if you need the weapons.
[244:09.07]But if the need ever arises, I would like to have it.
[244:11.08]Here's the elevator.
[244:24.70]Enough worms!
[244:26.32]Here comes my hardest puzzle yet!
[244:30.22]You've cheated through nine puzzles, but in combat now shall be scattered about.
[244:34.89]Come, caves, prepare for battle with... Whatever this is.
[244:41.17]Uh, it's the enemy from earlier.
[244:44.61]But its crown looks different.
[244:47.05]It looks the same.
[244:48.61]Yes, with my control crown, I may control any disc-shaped lifeform.
[244:54.98]Oh, no, it looks like it's in pain.
[244:56.94]It looks the same.
[244:58.76]Yes, the control crown is painful, but I'm certain this creature will feel its relief.
[245:03.56]But it sees how much more pain thou will be in.
[245:08.10]All right, we're gonna make him bob his head down.
[245:09.91]Uh, Susie's idea.
[245:14.05]Susie, you want to act?
[245:14.85]Uh, what's your idea?
[245:17.19]Well, how do I save this?
[245:18.71]I kind of need you for this one.
[245:21.15]That's fine.
[245:22.07]I'll help.
[245:22.31]Do you want to apologize to it for earlier?
[245:25.43]No, I just need you to stay still.
[245:29.61]First, we've got to get that crown off its head.
[245:32.14]Help me throw Rousey at it.
[245:35.20]Press C to determine the angle.
[245:39.84]Wait, back it up.
[245:40.80]How do I head back?
[245:42.98]No, I thought I was going to get...
[245:48.33]I thought I was going to get a... whatever.
[245:51.45]I'm going to go higher.
[245:52.67]Throw.
[245:54.77]I'm going to go up.
[246:01.27]Got it.
[246:02.91]Crown greatly loosened!
[246:10.52]Do it again.
[246:10.96]Knock it off.
[246:15.63]The crown greatly loosened.
[246:16.99]Maybe one or two more times, I would assume.
[246:25.03]And just like that.
[246:26.50]One, two, three.
[246:28.76]No?
[246:30.22]Yeah.
[246:31.70]Got it.
[246:32.08]Nice Super Mario sound effects.
[246:37.65]Only two dollars, though, unfortunately.
[246:41.70]Why, brilliant!
[246:42.60]Just brilliant.
[246:43.36]I knew you couldest do it, thou great heroes.
[246:46.63]Thou seeth that was merely a friendly test of thine abilities, but thou hast won, and now nothing blocks thine path.
[246:54.27]I, personally, could not be less of an obstruction.
[246:59.09]Good luck be with you, heroes.
[247:03.77]I hate this guy.
[247:04.99]This guy's... This guy sucks.
[247:15.15]But I think because of that, I think I like him.
[247:18.03]I think I like him because of that.
[247:19.81]It's weird.
[247:28.04]That makes him sort of like the best character in Deltarune so far, I think, because I don't like him.
[247:34.46]Riches, they shine with avarice.
[247:37.75]Riches.
[247:38.17]They shine with avarice.
[247:41.95]Wall banners, they seem to be... seem to have been through some kind of struggle.
[247:46.22]Okay.
[247:48.66]It was a struggle.
[247:50.58]Anything else?
[247:51.02]We've got a throne here.
[247:51.84]Make sure I save that.
[247:54.06]Oh my god.
[247:54.52]Gotta make sure I save my items.
[247:56.40]It's a throne!
[247:57.06]It seems to have been damaged in a struggle.
[247:58.98]Well, okay.
[248:00.53]There was a fight.
[248:10.28]Oh, there's Lancer.
[248:11.00]Hey, there's Lancer!
[248:12.60]That's what I said.
[248:17.49]Father!
[248:19.58]Lancer, my son.
[248:20.86]Have you dispatched the Leichners?
[248:22.82]As I commanded.
[248:25.11]no but I did even better it turns out we don't actually have to fight them they said they could just talk to you and they're alive yes and I think you'll like them a lot there's susie she's very purple and strong and where are they now all right the thing in the back distracted me because that's like a huge monster mouth um
[248:53.05]Are you talking to my son?
[248:54.51]CHAD JUNIOR!
[248:55.85]He's gonna take the cape off and he's gonna do the same stance.
[248:58.94]Hey, it's nice to meet you!
[249:00.90]Lancer, Lancer, my son.
[249:03.60]Yes, father.
[249:07.30]Chadad?
[249:08.64]Chad.
[249:10.34]C-H-D-A-D.
[249:11.86]Chadad.
[249:13.46]Do you remember what I told you?
[249:16.57]Don't get too attached?
[249:19.21]You have failed.
[249:21.03]They have poisoned you with their sentiment, their niceness.
[249:26.23]Free yourself, Lancer.
[249:27.27]They care not for you.
[249:28.33]Their only goal is to destroy our glorious fountain.
[249:32.00]They are scum.
[249:34.20]No, they aren't.
[249:36.24]What did you just say?
[249:39.44]Let him go.
[249:43.08]You want me to let him go?
[249:45.44]Very poor choice of words.
[249:49.87]I'll drop him off the edge and let him splatter.
[249:54.02]Unless you all kneel and learn your place.
[249:56.92]What will it be, Lightners?
[250:01.68]Don't listen to him, Susie.
[250:02.64]He'll... He'll... He'll... I didn't do that.
[250:06.47]I didn't press the button.
[250:07.41]Now watch, Lancer.
[250:10.01]See what happens when you befriend Lightners.
[250:14.25]What?
[250:14.91]No!
[250:16.81]You traitor!
[250:17.67]Come back here!
[250:19.88]Alright, enough already.
[250:22.38]Who the hell do you think you are?
[250:26.90]Ow.
[250:28.00]To my people, I am a hero.
[250:29.78]To you?
[250:33.58]I'm the bad guy.
[250:39.66]King, block the way.
[250:40.58]It really is a chat.
[250:43.76]Alright, King.
[250:44.64]Talk, talk, talk, talk.
[250:47.32]Let's talk.
[250:49.67]And let's defend.
[250:51.15]Susie tried to reason with the king.
[250:53.99]All right, listen up.
[250:55.25]Lancer's my friend.
[250:55.95]So if we can get by without hurting you, then... If I perish, so be it.
[251:01.88]Show my son the monster you really are.
[251:06.16]All right, you want to see what I can do, huh?
[251:09.22]Susie's will is changing.
[251:10.66]Talk became Redbuster.
[251:13.79]How dare you come here, Lightners?
[251:23.15]King's mouths babble indecipherably.
[251:28.70]Red Buster agreed to talk again.
[251:33.94]Then, Rousey tried to reason with the king.
[251:38.42]You might not realize it, but this is a world where you don't have to fight.
[251:41.88]I know if we try, we can all find another way.
[251:44.81]Such simple-minded prostitutes.
[251:46.87]Shame you will not live to realize your name.
[251:49.69]Now perish with the pathetic lightners you worship.
[251:53.64]Sorry, my friends and I aren't going anywhere.
[251:55.22]Whoa!
[251:56.94]What are you doing to me here?
[252:13.08]Alright, that's just the sound it makes when you win at, like, the ball-throwing machine of the Arcade.
[252:18.81]That's just, like, spitting out 14 tickets.
[252:21.43]It's not even worth it.
[252:22.33]It's 100 tickets to get a fucking Tootsie Roll.
[252:24.41]So... Um... I guess I could... Shut up.
[252:32.36]Just talk again.
[252:33.06]The battlefield is rumbling.
[252:34.12]Maybe magic?
[252:34.94]Rude.
[252:36.28]Fight?
[252:36.62]No.
[252:36.96]I kind of need to defend here.
[252:40.49]Magic.
[252:41.19]Heal.
[252:41.49]Prayer.
[252:41.85]Pacify.
[252:46.28]I'm just gonna let it play out.
[252:46.90]You tried to reason with the king.
[252:48.94]Silence, Lightbringer.
[252:50.30]Your very existence goes against our own by the knight's will.
[252:54.49]I shall shatter your heart into a million pieces.
[252:58.63]Your will is changing.
[252:59.61]Taunt became courage.
[253:02.47]You dare return to torment us once again.
[253:04.32]Ooh, okay.
[253:09.08]Interesting.
[253:09.64]Interesting.
[253:13.03]Interesting.
[253:14.35]The battlefield is rumbling.
[253:15.74]Alright, we got Red Buster, Dual Heal, Courage.
[253:20.80]That's a damage.
[253:23.38]Courage.
[253:24.19]Let's do Courage.
[253:27.03]And Rude Buster is a bunch of damage, right?
[253:33.48]Yeah, I'm not gonna do anything else.
[253:35.38]Magic.
[253:36.08]Heal Prayer.
[253:36.72]Pacify.
[253:37.62]Heal Prayer.
[253:38.26]I guess I can just heal.
[253:40.36]By myself.
[253:42.00]You encouraged the party.
[253:42.90]The party defense raised for this turn.
[253:45.62]Rousey cast Heal Prayer.
[253:46.69]Begone, we have found fresh purpose.
[253:48.83]I'm just gonna stay inside the cube.
[253:57.35]Alright.
[253:59.25]Uh, check.
[254:00.59]Courage.
[254:01.11]Dual heal.
[254:01.91]Heals everybody.
[254:02.72]Courage again.
[254:13.02]He's not really tired.
[254:15.48]You encourage the priority party's defense raises for this turn.
[254:20.06]For the knight has appeared.
[254:21.44]Oh, he's moving faster now.
[254:25.79]Oops.
[254:31.68]Check.
[254:32.02]Courage.
[254:32.38]Red Buster.
[254:32.98]Should I just do it?
[254:37.52]How many tickets was that?
[254:38.52]Ah, like, 12.
[254:43.99]No.
[254:44.29]Not yet.
[254:44.67]I don't think I need to.
[254:49.95]Party defense raised.
[254:51.65]The knight that pulls the fountains from the earth.
[254:54.74]Ooh, now he's getting pissed.
[255:06.22]The king's mouth gave a berserk smile.
[255:18.66]Why did I have to lean over and read?
[255:22.34]Why did I have to read that?
[255:28.57]Holy fountains whose shadows are creating a new world.
[255:35.07]What the fuck?
[255:37.68]I'm breaking my concentration.
[255:44.40]Hey, let's dual heal on... Doesn't matter, we'll just do it.
[255:52.09]Your soul shined its power on Rousey.
[255:54.29]Rousey cast dual heal.
[255:56.33]We're all good.
[255:57.59]Do you see now our new purpose?
[255:59.80]I mean, I don't.
[256:03.55]You have to tell it to me.
[256:05.05]Ooh.
[256:05.45]The battlefield is rumbling.
[256:09.47]Check.
[256:14.23]Abandoned by the Lightners, his heart became cracked with hatred.
[256:17.86]He cannot be reasoned with, but don't give up.
[256:20.62]To this world shall be blanketed in darkness, and darkness shall rule it.
[256:30.56]That was gonna make, like, a... Luigi doesn't do anything and wins.
[256:34.42]Isn't there, like, five, like, different videos of that?
[256:40.73]Isn't there, like, a... something like that?
[256:45.37]Courage!
[256:46.01]Dual heal!
[256:48.97]This is more like 500.
[256:51.59]Well, you know what I mean.
[256:52.52]Alright.
[256:53.18]Dual heal.
[256:57.90]Then you may see what it is like to live in despair.
[257:01.30]I'm getting... I'm getting hit here.
[257:09.79]Hey, Kurek, dual heal again!
[257:11.43]Why not?
[257:11.95]Let's just defend.
[257:16.77]Now enough talk.
[257:17.65]Fall before the Chain of Justice.
[257:20.18]Here we go.
[257:20.72]Ooh, I see what you're doing here.
[257:26.64]Oh, I see what you're doing here.
[257:27.98]It's kind of freaking me out, but we're good.
[257:32.52]Courage.
[257:34.08]Defend.
[257:34.40]Defend.
[257:37.04]Capardi's defense raised for this turn.
[257:39.33]You're quite strong, aren't you?
[257:40.75]I mean, if you say so.
[257:45.53]I like to think I'm pretty strong.
[257:49.09]The king's mouths give a berserk smile.
[257:54.04]Check.
[257:58.68]Dual heal.
[257:59.94]Defend.
[258:04.51]Oh, Otto, not right now.
[258:06.01]If I keep fighting you like this, then... Otto's like, let me out!
[258:16.10]The king's mouth.
[258:16.66]Hold on.
[258:16.84]Let's get a little mouth.
[258:19.72]Give me two.
[258:20.08]One second.
[258:46.65]So, uh, we're gonna do Act, Courage, Defend, Defend.
[258:54.97]I feel like we're getting to the end here.
[258:57.83]Defense has been raised.
[258:59.13]It seems that... What is next?
[259:10.38]It seems what?
[259:11.14]It seems what?
[259:12.32]What does it seem?
[259:13.72]Tell me!
[259:17.37]My knight, I shall not fail you.
[259:30.52]Enough is enough.
[259:31.60]I see.
[259:32.08]I see that I cannot defeat you.
[259:35.46]I have grown exhausted from our long battle.
[259:42.80]Lightners, I... Perhaps I have been too cruel.
[259:47.22]The truth is I was not always this way.
[259:50.08]There once was a time where Darkners and Lightners lived in harmony.
[259:54.74]A time where Darkners could fulfill their purpose in peace.
[259:58.38]It would be a lie, it would be a lie, uh oh, to say that I too do not yearn for those days.
[260:10.24]Perhaps, perhaps you young ones are right.
[260:13.60]Please let us put away our weapons.
[260:15.10]There must be a peaceful solution to all this.
[260:23.13]Come now, Suzy.
[260:27.85]I'm glad you're starting to realize, Mr. King, none of us really want to fight.
[260:32.39]If you can just tell us about your worries, I'm sure we can all be friends, Mr. King.
[260:39.04]Yes, yes, friends.
[260:41.10]That sounds lovely.
[260:46.79]My apologies, I'm not used to fighting like that.
[260:49.81]My body is getting weak.
[260:52.85]Oh, don't say another word.
[260:53.87]Hey, you should be all healed up.
[261:01.29]How do you feel?
[261:03.41]Let's see.
[261:05.85]Dick.
[261:08.87]Never better!
[261:13.27]Did I say you could get up?
[261:17.57]Chris!
[261:20.11]Oh, spare me the heroics.
[261:31.52]You, you're the leader, aren't you?
[261:33.86]So what's your plan?
[261:35.16]To laugh as you cast us all back into obscurity?
[261:37.94]You can't even say.
[261:42.12]Young one, let me tell you a secret.
[261:47.06]Quiet people piss me off.
[261:54.85]He's doing a Bane impression.
[261:56.53]Stop it.
[261:57.99]Hey, get away from my friend.
[262:01.57]Or what?
[262:04.88]You'll kill me?
[262:07.48]Nah.
[262:11.38]So what's your plan then?
[262:13.14]To talk me to death?
[262:14.22]You stupid, stupid Lightner.
[262:20.27]You honestly think you have any way to convince me not to kill you?
[262:25.77]Nah.
[262:26.94]But they might.
[262:32.66]Lancer!
[262:34.06]Everyone!
[262:35.36]What is the meaning of this?
[262:37.44]Sorry, Dad.
[262:38.24]You're being overthrown.
[262:39.98]When I told everyone you were fighting the Lightners, everyone remembered how kind they were.
[262:45.34]This is not a... Let me change it.
[262:47.89]They decided they'd rather have a king that accepts them.
[262:51.09]Me.
[262:52.23]Now I'm the dad.
[262:54.05]You idiots.
[262:54.63]The Lightners are your enemies.
[262:56.49]Fools.
[262:56.99]I'll kill you.
[262:57.59]I'll kill all of you.
[263:00.25]Yikes.
[263:00.97]That's gonna be... I think someone needs a time out.
[263:05.11]Go to your room, Dad.
[263:10.32]No!
[263:12.50]You all right, dude?
[263:17.54]Chris?
[263:17.90]Susie?
[263:18.42]Oh, you're all right.
[263:20.49]Yeah.
[263:21.19]It'll take more than that to take us down.
[263:27.53]Hey, I'm sorry, because I healed the king.
[263:30.19]We almost... Susie, you were right.
[263:33.45]I was foolish to think we could act so soft to everyone.
[263:36.86]This isn't a world where kindness always wins, is it?
[263:39.20]Did I do it wrong?
[263:41.06]Is this one of those scenarios where now I did it wrong because I did it the other way?
[263:44.72]I did it wrong this time?
[263:46.38]It's complicated.
[263:47.10]Yeah, sometimes there's people you just gotta fight.
[263:51.02]But if you never let your guard down, then you might just hurt someone you care about.
[263:56.93]Oh, Susie, you're beginning to sound like a real hero.
[264:01.97]Don't get used to it.
[264:04.47]Then I suppose you and Chris should return home now.
[264:09.92]Yeah.
[264:11.26]I guess that's it.
[264:16.52]Well, see ya.
[264:35.11]Of course you wanna- you wanna go say goodbye to everyone, don't you?
[264:39.58]Well, if you're gonna make me, I guess we can go back.
[264:47.20]Hey!
[264:49.62]Susie, you came back!
[264:50.88]Uh, well, uh, we just wanted to say bye, you know?
[264:54.07]Oh, actually, everyone here wanted to say goodbye too.
[264:58.57]Please let me know when you leave, alright?
[265:01.50]Yeah.
[265:02.66]Okay.
[265:04.34]Are we really gonna do the thing where you go to a family get-together and you... part of you is just sitting there going, uh, I gotta like go around in a giant circle and like say bye to everybody and say hi to everybody.
[265:19.20]And I don't want to miss somebody because then I feel like they would be slighted.
[265:25.50]And sometimes, I forget that I may have already said bye and shaken the hands of, like, some uncle.
[265:32.11]And I go and I do it again.
[265:34.09]And in their mind, they're like, what the fuck is he doing?
[265:36.03]He said bye to me, like, four minutes ago.
[265:44.56]Way to go, kids!
[265:45.50]Now we can go back to making the puzzles we love.
[265:48.90]And thanks to your donation, I can buy a new hat.
[265:51.74]And some shaving cream.
[265:55.18]Isn't that nice?
[265:56.88]Best, you're the best.
[265:59.90]Honestly, we owe you.
[266:04.85]You're absolutely amazing.
[266:06.43]Great work.
[266:11.93]I'm going to have to go now.
[266:14.13]Thank you.
[266:14.73]I can go back to being a coat hanger now.
[266:16.85]By the way, I asked Sean to come here, but there wasn't any interest.
[266:22.95]Wi-Fi Kirby.
[266:24.25]Even a little ball can say something like thank you.
[266:26.61]Thanks.
[266:31.75]Darn, Horsey.
[266:33.15]You've done us a big help.
[266:35.89]Now all of us pieces can live in pieces.
[266:39.77]My nostrils can't thank you enough.
[266:43.00]You did it.
[266:43.48]You ousted that rotten tyrant.
[266:45.46]I'll happily accept a bounty of credit for my contributions.
[266:48.62]Unless the king reappears, in which case, I did nothing.
[266:52.54]And the best for last.
[266:54.66]Wonderful work, my amigos.
[266:57.18]Thou hast toppled the tyrant freedest of our creeds.
[267:01.16]Truly a history shall not forget.
[267:03.60]The tale of rules card and the three heroes.
[267:07.87]Did you hear that laugh I just did?
[267:09.93]What was that?
[267:10.71]That was a...
[267:14.14]Everybody's here.
[267:15.10]Look, I knew you could do it.
[267:16.22]I was your enemy.
[267:17.78]I was cheering for you.
[267:18.92]That's how much I disliked my job.
[267:23.04]The future looks sweet, like a pile of bees puke.
[267:25.81]Which is honey, I think.
[267:27.37]A kingdom with so much hope.
[267:28.61]Hope you didn't screw it up.
[267:30.41]That means thank you.
[267:32.55]On to our next birthday, too.
[267:34.01]We'll have one soon, if that's possible.
[267:36.23]Kathy looked at you proudly.
[267:40.91]Kiss.
[267:42.81]What's going on?
[267:43.43]I slept through everything.
[267:48.52]Wait, what about these people?
[267:49.34]Oh, I can give him his cake!
[267:53.16]I can give him the cake.
[267:53.90]Oh, I ate the cake.
[267:56.04]That's right.
[268:05.55]Us animals decided it's okay if the kings stay in the cages as well.
[268:10.33]Because they'll have to put on animal ears and noses.
[268:13.21]Why did we not let them out?
[268:14.65]What ho, what about us?
[268:15.71]Aren't we going to be restored as kings?
[268:18.29]Ah, my treasure is unharmed.
[268:19.57]Carry on then.
[268:23.57]I'll be honest.
[268:24.47]At first we weren't sure who would make our new king.
[268:28.86]I mean, Lancer has always been a bit of a pain.
[268:31.74]But after seeing how nice he treats you guys, I think he'll be fine.
[268:37.05]Susie, blue person whose name I neglected to learn all along.
[268:40.47]I thought you were going home.
[268:42.55]We were, but Chris wanted to say bye, you know.
[268:45.05]Oh, really?
[268:46.29]That's funny.
[268:47.91]I thought you wanted to say bye because we're friends.
[268:50.01]Uh, I mean, I didn't not want to.
[268:54.02]Uh, so you're the king now, huh?
[268:56.80]Yes, and I'm changing some big rules.
[268:58.98]First, Lightners are now legal.
[269:01.44]Second, prison is now only for dads.
[269:04.78]Sounds like some pretty good changes.
[269:07.44]Hey, your dad was protecting the fountain, right?
[269:09.30]Is it gonna be okay if we mess with it?
[269:12.59]I have no idea.
[269:13.83]But it's you guys, so I trust you.
[269:16.97]If something bad happens, we'll fix it up.
[269:18.69]Yeah, guess we'll just see how it goes.
[269:21.43]Well, see you later.
[269:23.31]Come back soon.
[269:24.37]There's always room in town for a couple of clowns.
[269:28.47]And you.
[269:30.23]Because you rescued it, it grew to respect you.
[269:32.85]Well, actually, maybe it shrunk to respect you.
[269:37.90]That's pretty good.
[269:39.66]That was pretty good.
[269:46.52]Alright, bye everybody.
[269:47.32]That was fun.
[269:52.01]That was a blast.
[269:52.97]That was really... Susie, Chris, are you going to leave?
[269:55.15]I just wanted to say I... I really enjoyed meeting you two and...
[270:07.31]Stop mumbling into your hat for a second.
[270:09.05]I can barely hear you, dude.
[270:12.39]Oh, I'm sorry.
[270:12.94]Uh, Chris, Susie, I... I hope I can see you again soon.
[270:22.60]Is that, um... Is that... Is this supposed to be a big reveal?
[270:28.86]That's... Do we go back in time?
[270:34.46]Next time I'll make you lots of yummy cakes, alright?
[270:42.65]Yeah, sure, dude.
[270:49.56]Let's go.
[270:49.98]Yeah, wouldn't that... that's... We went back in time.
[270:57.16]That's Asriel.
[271:04.21]So now what happens?
[271:09.11]He's reading chat.
[271:10.51]I mean, I'm trying to keep up to date, but... Is this the fountain?
[271:18.44]Don't know how, but it feels like we stumbled into something really important, didn't we?
[271:36.96]Well, there's no time to think about that now.
[271:42.12]Right now, it's time to go home.
[271:50.19]Right, Chris?
[271:55.07]As you stood in front of the fountain, you felt something strange.
[272:00.64]It was as if your very soul was glowing.
[272:11.44]Did I die?
[272:12.24]Was I giving my soul to the fountain?
[272:28.43]What happened?
[272:29.45]I can't see anything.
[272:32.99]Hey, watch it!
[272:37.53]Uh-huh.
[272:39.69]The unused classroom.
[272:42.21]How did we get here?
[272:46.07]It was all just, they were just playing chess.
[272:50.09]And they went into the staff room and they did all the drugs that were in the teacher's staff closet.
[272:55.78]Hey, Chris, what just happened?
[273:00.06]That wasn't a dream or anything, was it?
[273:06.56]Anyway, as I was saying, let's just tell Alphys we couldn't find any chalk.
[273:16.08]What is this?
[273:16.72]It's a worn down stuffed animal.
[273:19.84]We just did like the teacher's crack in the back and we just had a playing card spill out of a deck in the closet.
[273:31.97]Man, the sun's already setting.
[273:33.63]Everyone else must have gone home by now.
[273:36.91]Guess Alfies will know better than to ask us next time, huh?
[273:43.00]What's with all the bird and animal noises?
[273:47.80]Well, guess we should go.
[273:48.58]See you later, I guess.
[273:56.14]Uh, I just want to say, I had a lot of fun doing a bunch of drugs with you.
[274:00.49]Maybe we should do that again tomorrow.
[274:07.21]Let's go back there tomorrow.
[274:15.01]Okay, sure.
[274:18.50]The door is locked.
[274:19.38]The door is locked.
[274:29.62]Are you ready for the Sadie Hawkman's dance?
[274:32.42]At this dance hall, the chaperones wear giant hawk heads.
[274:35.75]and screech at any students that make contact.
[274:40.50]The lock is locked.
[274:43.28]Nobody in the classroom.
[274:44.16]What about on the computer?
[274:45.36]The computer is turned off.
[274:46.60]Everything felt peaceful for a moment.
[274:51.06]Looks like motivational quotes from various literature.
[274:53.58]Try your best, Astro Wolf, even in your darkest hour.
[274:56.71]That one seems to be from a video game.
[275:04.56]You ran the water fountain.
[275:05.46]It's lukewarm.
[275:09.56]I didn't go in this classroom.
[275:11.00]It's a computer.
[275:12.24]Its desktop wallpaper is you and your brother dressed up for Halloween eight years ago.
[275:19.88]Uh, well, okay.
[275:22.80]You and your brother?
[275:23.46]Oh.
[275:25.88]It's a cool Minecraft house.
[275:27.51]Some kind of primitive sculpture who knows what it represents.
[275:32.01]The throne of the gods.
[275:34.09]Okay.
[275:41.20]Ring ring.
[275:42.82]Chris?
[275:43.92]Whatever have you been doing?
[275:45.68]I sat in the car waiting for you after school for half an hour.
[275:49.32]I called and called, but you never picked up.
[275:51.25]You had your poor mother worried sick.
[275:53.95]Chris, I'm afraid I'm going to have to punish you.
[275:56.89]Huh?
[275:57.87]A friend?
[275:58.97]You were spending time with a friend?
[276:02.29]Chris, I will make an exception this time.
[276:04.93]You can continue your adventures a little longer.
[276:07.47]But when you return home, you're going to have to go to bed early.
[276:11.28]See you soon, honey.
[276:12.94]Click.
[276:24.14]I was like, just leave school?
[276:30.87]Is the game, the game's not over?
[276:32.45]I have to like walk around town?
[276:33.73]I have to walk around like Springfield and the Simpsons?
[276:43.06]There's the library.
[276:46.36]Oh, look at all of my friends!
[276:47.93]Chris, what's up?
[276:49.33]Caddy's working, so I'm starting on our project.
[276:51.65]I've already copied a bunch of pictures.
[276:54.11]It's the same picture of a soccer ball 73 times.
[277:00.77]Gotta go to Kaulig.
[277:02.91]So, Tem Stubby.
[277:04.09]Hard.
[277:05.15]She's reading a comic full of hot demon guides.
[277:07.62]What the f- What?
[277:11.32]I love reading books, especially the books upstairs.
[277:13.48]You should really read them.
[277:15.30]Can you get out of the way?
[277:20.77]Consider it, Chris!
[277:43.68]Okay.
[278:01.79]There's an anime review.
[278:02.97]Read it.
[278:04.09]No, no, no, no.
[278:05.61]Yes.
[278:06.87]Teens Corner Monthly Toon Review Mew Mew Kissy Cutie 2.
[278:11.46]This reviewer had Mew Mew 2 as her first exposure to the series.
[278:16.54]And let her tell you it makes Mew Mew 1 look like a dumpster with sparkly cat ears.
[278:22.12]With a darker storyline and more mature themes, the second one treats the viewer like a real adult instead of like an animal that will die if it goes 10 seconds without seeing a beach ball.
[278:32.19]Not to mention, Mew Mew's character in the first one is more stale than the ramen I eat at home by myself with the lights off.
[278:39.13]Teens and older... Teens and older should check out this dark masterpiece.
[278:44.27]Signed, the anonymous yellow lizard.
[278:59.82]This is a kid here in the first game.
[279:01.76]Hey punk, get out of the road.
[279:03.32]You're blocking traffic.
[279:04.32]Oh wait, it's just Asgore's kid.
[279:09.52]Sorry, I'm a little worked up lately.
[279:11.65]This job is so boring, nothing ever happens in this town.
[279:17.37]I just wish something would shake things up.
[279:20.21]Oh, you got something to report?
[279:25.63]Dark world.
[279:34.65]What?
[279:35.05]There's a dark world inside the school?
[279:37.67]Uh, sure, kid.
[279:39.11]There's no law against dark worlds anyway.
[279:41.21]That's a job for the school board.
[279:43.15]Uh, Alfies.
[279:48.87]Alfies?
[279:49.59]Who's Alfies?
[279:50.31]No idea who you're talking about.
[279:52.43]Why, did they do something illegal?
[279:54.23]Gotcha.
[279:54.59]If I see Alfies, I'll tackle them.
[279:57.39]Foo-foo-foo-foo-foo-foo-foo-foo.
[279:58.91]They're as good as dead.
[280:02.74]Help you.
[280:03.52]Aw, you want to help me?
[280:04.42]Sure, punk.
[280:05.97]Get someone to rob the bank so I can suplex him.
[280:08.79]Wait, do we even have a bank?
[280:10.29]Hey, get someone to build a bank.
[280:14.74]What's going on over here?
[280:15.64]How am I supposed to get past this blue lady?
[280:18.90]I'm stuck.
[280:19.98]I guess I should just run away.
[280:23.32]Police Chief Undyne is supposed to be directing traffic, but all she's doing is standing in the middle of the street yelling, get out of my way.
[280:30.95]She's the best, huh?
[280:31.99]I feel really directed.
[280:32.85]Alright, let's go in the hospital.
[280:41.35]Holy shit.
[280:42.15]It's one of those sliding bead toys that naturally spawns inside of doctor's offices.
[280:48.32]The beads march grimly along their set path.
[280:52.71]Plink You usually play the piano a bit more beautifully Is everything okay?
[280:55.22]You do seem a little sick
[281:14.50]Oh, Dad, I just... I can't just say that to her.
[281:18.46]Oh my god, I'd die.
[281:19.91]I'd literally die.
[281:22.31]Oh well, sweetheart.
[281:23.35]First time I laid eyes on your mother.
[281:24.97]I walked right up and told her she was a hot piece of work.
[281:29.19]Really?
[281:30.31]Yeah, she slapped me so hard I blacked out.
[281:36.08]Dad, that doesn't help at all.
[281:38.38]Anyhow, how's Dragon and Blazers 3?
[281:41.12]Beat it yet?
[281:43.26]No, I'm still at the Ice Palace.
[281:44.84]I've been kind of... kind of waiting to finish it with you, Dad.
[281:47.98]Oh, well.
[281:50.36]Maybe, uh, you shouldn't wait.
[281:53.20]Dad?
[281:54.58]You should bring it here.
[281:55.71]I'm bored as hell!
[281:57.65]Har har har.
[281:58.47]Fine, you win.
[281:59.19]I'll bring it next time.
[282:00.21]Oh, it's getting late.
[282:01.13]Guess I better go.
[282:02.49]I've got homework.
[282:04.49]Oh, that's the group project voice.
[282:06.81]Bird guy again.
[282:07.73]What's his name?
[282:08.51]Nerdly?
[282:10.73]It's, uh, Birdly.
[282:11.93]He's not that bad, Dad.
[282:15.08]I'll kick his ass.
[282:19.14]Dad, you're not even supposed to get up!
[282:22.78]Bring him by the window, I'll throw something at him.
[282:26.18]Goodbye, Dad.
[282:28.06]Bye, honey.
[282:31.96]Oh, hi, Chris.
[282:37.71]Oh!
[282:38.69]So you're just here to use the sink, huh?
[282:40.61]Come on, Chris, be a little friendlier.
[282:44.97]I'm just here to use the set.
[282:47.17]Well, jingle my gosh darn bells.
[282:49.15]Looks like Fristmas came early.
[282:51.49]Alright, Chris, just give me the straight shot.
[282:53.50]Why are you here?
[282:53.98]Did your mom make you come here?
[282:57.40]No.
[282:57.76]Really?
[282:58.04]You've grown up a lot, Chris.
[282:59.94]I'm proud of you.
[283:01.20]It wasn't too long ago you were just the creepy kid next door.
[283:04.48]Now you're the creepy kid right in front of me.
[283:07.79]Okay, alright, alright.
[283:08.53]Seriously, you want to chat or something?
[283:13.23]Certified Dad.
[283:15.45]Uh, so why am I in here?
[283:17.17]Well, they found some crap, so it's just some tests.
[283:19.99]It's no big deal.
[283:20.79]Nothing a holiday can't handle.
[283:22.82]I'll be out of here in a jiffy.
[283:24.66]And then I can go back to, uh, I don't know, yelling at you for getting tangled in our light display.
[283:32.28]Hey, Chris, you want to chat or something?
[283:33.85]Don't worry.
[283:34.49]There's no way you can bore me right now.
[283:37.17]Uh, family.
[283:38.89]Chris, even if we're grown apart, we still love your family.
[283:42.43]After all, me and Asgore were college pals, right?
[283:46.76]Oh, hey, now that Asriel's off to college, you think he's doing any crazy parties like me and your dad?
[283:54.34]I'm just pulling your leg.
[283:55.60]Your dad was no party animal.
[283:56.88]Your mother, on the other hand, she'd always fuss about going, but once the party started, yikes, fam, when she hit me clear across the room with a key lime pipe, I got smashed into the snack table and toppled everything.
[284:10.14]Tasty pie, though, couldn't complain.
[284:17.47]Uh, what about Noelle?
[284:19.61]She's a sweetheart, isn't she, Chris?
[284:21.15]Smart, kind, sweet, couldn't ask for a better daughter.
[284:23.76]I just wish she wasn't so defenseless.
[284:26.54]Scary movies, bugs, Santa Claus, everything scares her.
[284:30.14]And when it happens, she freezes like a deer in headlights.
[284:33.95]Remember, she used to even be afraid of humans under the bed.
[284:37.72]Chris, it was not nice of you to hide under there, by the way.
[284:41.42]Anyway, that's what's tough about being in here, Chris.
[284:44.72]Not what's going on with me.
[284:46.57]Just that, in the meantime, I can't be there to protect her.
[284:49.37]Keep an eye out for her, okay?
[284:52.35]I will.
[284:52.61]Wait, hold on.
[284:55.51]You forget my name or something?
[284:56.71]Patient name, Rudolph Rudy Holliday.
[285:02.95]What's over here?
[285:03.97]It's a regular sink.
[285:07.42]This castle's...
[285:33.23]White wizards relegated me to this healing chamber.
[285:38.40]But my blood is boiling for battle!
[285:46.50]What?
[285:46.74]Well, okay.
[286:02.52]That was the hospital.
[286:03.18]We can go into the police station.
[286:09.31]Nothing else.
[286:09.77]Police tape is blocking the way.
[286:11.05]The tape simply reads... Nyah!
[286:14.21]Nyah!
[286:17.30]You knock on the door to the police station.
[286:21.24]Someone's coming up to the window.
[286:24.00]They just closed the blinds.
[286:30.77]Seems like the police aren't really feeling it right now.
[286:33.55]Alright.
[286:41.81]QC's Diner.
[286:45.01]Ice E's Pizza.
[286:47.69]What is going on here?
[286:49.35]Why?
[286:51.29]What is happening?
[286:52.76]Oh god, someone's actually here.
[286:54.82]Ice E's Pizza.
[286:56.38]Your number one spot for a piping hot piece of pizza.
[287:01.22]Hey, wait a second.
[287:02.46]I recognize you.
[287:05.98]Little buddy, it's me!
[287:07.90]Wanna chat for a minute before I lose my mind?
[287:14.86]Do you know when Azzy's coming home?
[287:17.70]You can't tell him this, but I really miss the guy.
[287:19.94]It'd be sweet to cruise around town like old times.
[287:23.16]Picking up, for example, chicks.
[287:26.16]Which, as a matter of course, may not have ever actually happened.
[287:30.42]But one time, Undyne made eye contact with me.
[287:34.74]She was writing me a speeding ticket.
[287:39.04]Hey, little buddy, what's up?
[287:41.19]job make no mistake little buddy I see his pizza is hell I can't slack off for seconds without hearing be a team player there's no I in pizza yes there is you just took it out but it's okay little buddy I've been saving up to go to college where as he is then I'll get a theater degree become a famous actor and let the fangirls roll in little buddy
[288:11.61]Ah, yes, little buddy, good idea.
[288:13.29]Meet the Rogues Gallery.
[288:14.89]Blue ears, soft serve, obsessed, no concept of personal space.
[288:18.71]Keeps accidentally pouring slushies on me and giggling.
[288:22.27]The Warrior, thankfully absent due to pizza-related injuries.
[288:26.01]Constantly terrorizing customers with war chants.
[288:29.21]Purple guy, man, that guy, you gotta... Actually, does that guy even work here?
[288:33.07]Uh, my co-workers, where would I be without them?
[288:36.11]A happy place, little buddy, a much happier place.
[288:43.12]Would you be interested in trying some of our many 24 pizza flavors?
[288:46.78]We've got normal, cheese, ice, gravy, double ice, peperonis, and more.
[288:53.60]Stop by and get an Icy's Pizza.
[289:02.91]Ice me up, ice me up, boss.
[289:09.52]What does it say?
[289:10.80]The entrance is locked, no one's inside.
[289:12.52]Seems like all of the employees are outside in costume.
[289:18.63]Uh, the diner.
[289:23.73]That's the best character in the whole game.
[289:28.59]I mean, that's the best character in the entire game.
[289:33.96]Why wasn't that a party member?
[289:37.58]I'm dead serious.
[289:38.66]Why the fuck is this guy not a party member?
[289:40.70]This should have been the other character.
[289:45.94]I want to hear this guy's entire life story.
[289:49.31]Looking at my rugged body, you must wonder what kind of secrets I hold.
[289:52.75]My secret is I put all my leftover pancakes in this giant hat.
[289:56.91]I mean, that's hysterical.
[289:59.86]Hysterical.
[290:01.78]At some point, during the movie, he could take the hat off and he would never say that and there would just be pancakes under there.
[290:08.83]Absolutely fucking remarkable view.
[290:10.75]I sure love pancake.
[290:16.93]Ice Wolf does not like ice and drink.
[290:19.22]Ice Wolf likes ice.
[290:20.94]To be drink.
[290:22.56]To be drink.
[290:23.18]What?
[290:25.00]So for you two girls, that'll be the crepes, a cinnamon latte, two bunny parfaits, and a piece of firewood.
[290:32.85]I like the vibe of the waitress here.
[290:34.29]Maybe I should sign up too.
[290:36.47]Nah, serving drinks wouldn't really suit a fire elemental.
[290:39.83]If I got nervous, I'd just melt all the ice.
[290:41.94]Damn it, I wish I had more to say.
[290:50.07]Hey there, I haven't seen you in a while.
[290:51.37]I remember back on Sundays after service, you and your family would come in and order the special.
[290:56.67]Of course, things happened and then y'all stopped coming together.
[291:01.71]But every Sunday, you and your brother would still come in.
[291:04.80]He'd order you a hot chocolate.
[291:06.92]And you two would sit down at that table in the corner, drawing shapes in the window with your breath.
[291:12.78]You must really miss him, hon.
[291:14.82]Here, how about this?
[291:16.50]Chris got the hot chocolate.
[291:18.29]On the house, hon.
[291:24.10]Uh, we'll take the special.
[291:25.34]And do you have any edible glitter?
[291:27.82]The youngest one won't eat anything if it doesn't look like treasure.
[291:33.44]You're alive.
[291:33.96]Nice.
[291:36.95]I'm working.
[291:37.43]Alright.
[291:41.19]Goodbye.
[291:55.60]I can't go over there.
[292:06.50]Yes!
[292:11.13]Hey, look who's walking around.
[292:12.29]Alright, alright, good.
[292:16.09]Who the hell are you?
[292:16.75]Good to see you again!
[292:18.11]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[292:20.11]Especially uh - 'cause-
[292:23.11]My name's Sans-
[292:26.11]Ah what's up? You're my friend right?
[292:29.11]I just moved here so I hardly know anyone.
[292:31.11]Why uh, you got anyone I should know better?
[292:34.11]Me!
[292:35.66]Whoa there, tiger. Uh you can't just jump straight into friendship.
[292:39.66]It takes time.
[292:42.00]Alright, that's enough time. Take this. Call it whenever you feel like it.
[292:48.10]You got Sans's phone number.
[292:55.09]I'm okay.
[292:56.47]Hey, what's up?
[292:57.87]Uh, what's in the store?
[292:59.45]Behind me?
[292:59.91]Yeah, that's the grocery store.
[293:01.45]Unfortunately, it's closed.
[293:03.11]What a pain.
[293:03.71]I really wanted to buy some milk.
[293:05.83]Someone had a complaint or the guy that runs it.
[293:09.45]Hey, bud.
[293:10.93]Uh, you busy tomorrow?
[293:12.89]I need some help with something, Fred.
[293:16.09]It'd be great if you could come over, Fred.
[293:18.97]And bring Dino too.
[293:21.90]I live just next door, you know.
[293:26.08]Yes.
[293:29.59]Wow, you were deliberate in there for a while.
[293:35.46]Gee, what's wrong?
[293:36.36]Don't want to hang out with a stranger.
[293:38.38]Well, I guess I shouldn't complain.
[293:40.46]What are we going to be doing?
[293:42.18]Oh, I'm not going to be there.
[293:43.90]That'd be weird.
[293:45.18]It's just going to be you and my little brother.
[293:50.80]He needs friends.
[293:52.24]Thanks for hanging out with him.
[293:54.02]See you.
[293:58.28]What's up?
[293:59.76]Uh, friends.
[294:00.16]We just moved here, so I hardly know why I got anyone I should be friends with.
[294:03.57]Hmm.
[294:05.07]Uh, my mom.
[294:05.51]Who else?
[294:06.93]You should be friends with my teacher.
[294:33.28]Alfie's, yeah, I know about her.
[294:35.43]Came into the store with a suitcase and sunglasses.
[294:38.69]Thought she was part of the mob.
[294:41.15]She opened the case and stuffed it full of instant noodles.
[294:44.31]Paid us small bills.
[294:46.30]Then slunk out of the place.
[294:48.36]Pajamas trailing on the floor.
[294:50.80]Anyway, our relationship is purely business.
[294:54.02]So, uh, I guess I'll let her do her thing.
[295:06.22]Behind me?
[295:06.56]Yeah, that's the score shooter.
[295:07.42]Okay, alright.
[295:07.92]So I can't wait to hang out with you tomorrow.
[295:09.26]We're gonna be best friends.
[295:09.86]Okay, bye.
[295:21.81]Hello?
[295:23.44]You've reached the hotline for idiot babies.
[295:26.14]Please press 1 for idiots, 2 for babies, 3 for idiot babies, and 4 for none.
[295:36.98]Why'd you call a hotline for idiot babies if you aren't an idiot baby?
[295:45.92]Not Sans' number!
[295:50.71]The phone kept ringing infinitely.
[295:52.67]What?
[295:53.09]No!
[295:58.43]Knock, knock, knock.
[296:00.23]No response.
[296:01.33]But the distant trussle of bones!
[296:06.42]can be heard in the distance.
[296:16.06]Oh, you got something better to do.
[296:17.38]Okay, me too.
[296:19.14]I'll be standing here doing nothing.
[296:20.20]Knock knock.
[296:26.71]Ooh, are you the human that lives at the top of town?
[296:28.97]Wow, my mommy told me about you.
[296:30.89]Does it hurt to be made of blood?
[296:34.64]Um... No.
[296:37.19]Knock, knock, knock.
[296:38.03]Huh?
[296:38.29]That sounds like the knock of a beginner.
[296:40.47]Come back when you've gotten better at knocking.
[296:44.45]There's a bird.
[296:45.49]There's a bird.
[296:46.03]Whoo!
[296:46.57]You're lucky, Chris.
[296:47.88]You got to miss class with Alfies.
[296:49.58]It's not fair.
[296:51.28]If I skipped class, my dad would never let me hear the end of it.
[296:53.88]Ha ha ha ha.
[296:55.52]That's actually not even remotely funny.
[296:58.28]I mean, it was a little... Yo, Chris, you survived Susie!
[297:01.54]I mean, I never saw her beat anyone up, but I'd be careful.
[297:05.44]Like, one time, me, Snowy, and Junkington were playing handball, and she just kept creepily watching us from the corner.
[297:12.26]Then, when the ball rolled over to her, she just froze solid and kicked the ball as hard as she could right into Officer Undyne's car.
[297:20.31]Then Undyne came out, smiling, cracked her knuckles, and totally wiped us at handball.
[297:25.83]Anyway, Susie sucks, Chris.
[297:37.34]Oi, Snowy!
[297:38.22]What did I tell you about knocking the door so hard?
[297:41.13]Don't do it!
[297:42.55]It's really gonna hurt your face!
[297:44.15]We don't have arms, you know?
[297:50.55]What are you doing in the trash?
[297:57.09]Oh, Chris, Chris, you're okay.
[297:59.39]I was really worried when you didn't come back.
[298:02.59]Where did you go?
[298:03.63]Did you skip class?
[298:04.69]Well, don't worry about it.
[298:06.45]I'm the cool teacher, you know.
[298:07.75]You're not in trouble.
[298:10.14]Well, let me know if you need anything.
[298:14.94]It's a dirty trash can.
[298:16.78]It's a dirty trash can.
[298:18.44]It's a trash can full of well-kept flowers.
[298:21.37]It's a saucer of milk.
[298:24.25]Oh, Chris.
[298:25.65]Did you want to talk about something?
[298:29.86]Chalk.
[298:31.95]Chris, even though you never got the chalk, you deserve an award for trying so hard to find it.
[298:36.79]So in return, I can let you borrow, um, my homemade DVD collection of The Simpsons.
[298:43.62]You know, the sitcom about the middle-class monster family?
[298:46.42]It's got every episode in all 28 seasons.
[298:49.70]It's the funniest, most quotable show ever.
[298:52.98]But make sure you don't watch past the second season, since they just rebut... Why?
[298:56.68]They started diving their own material and fighting giant giga-demons, then lost the focus of family earlier when their vehicles were shaped like animals and they were friends with the animal vehicles, and then let's not get into symptoms, gout, and forceful symptoms, just go to the other side of the board and make that gravitation feel just... Okay.
[299:12.55]You don't want to watch it.
[299:14.26]That's okay, Chris.
[299:18.10]Hey, thanks.
[299:18.84]Enjoy your life back here.
[299:24.62]I don't know, I just got spoiled for the whole season.
[299:32.85]Oh look, it's the cat!
[299:46.84]There's so much here.
[299:48.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[299:50.82]It's your dad's truck.
[299:52.76]The floor of the front seat is littered with old papers and country CDs.
[300:04.89]Knock, knock.
[300:06.05]I'm afraid no one's home right now, darling.
[300:08.62]Now why don't you prance on home?
[300:10.76]Okay.
[300:14.21]Chrissy, like, long time no see.
[300:16.43]What's up?
[300:16.95]Did you want to talk about something?
[300:18.21]Neighbor.
[300:21.88]Uh, that chick next door drives me nuts.
[300:24.24]I keep seeing her everywhere I go.
[300:25.86]She's a total copycat.
[300:27.76]Like, why though?
[300:29.30]Doesn't she realize she'll never be me?
[300:31.44]It really is the girl from the Muppets.
[300:33.88]Honestly, her whole family is, like, so trashy.
[300:37.68]That's the, um, from Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.
[300:46.09]That's not, I'm not doing Trump.
[300:47.79]What?
[300:51.03]Honestly, her whole family is like so trashy.
[300:54.27]Once her sister served me a coffee and I swear it was half cat foot.
[300:57.47]It really is.
[300:58.17]That is what I'm doing.
[301:00.13]But that's, I'm trying to do the voice that they're... Like, get a haircut, girl, for like your whole body.
[301:10.74]It's a bootleg Zoolander.
[301:17.61]Hey, neighbor.
[301:19.19]When's your brother Doug going to come by?
[301:22.69]My girls would love to see him.
[301:24.15]He's a sweet little man.
[301:25.63]Very little, but he's sweet.
[301:28.28]He's just got one problem.
[301:29.54]Just a small problem, not a big problem.
[301:32.74]He doesn't like my wife's cooking.
[301:34.62]Not really at all.
[301:36.60]That's wrong, Douglas.
[301:38.38]You don't like frozen cat food?
[301:40.56]The whole neighborhood is Trump.
[301:46.14]Tarantino.
[301:55.32]That really was Tarantino.
[301:58.16]Let me tell you.
[302:00.46]Alright, let's get that out.
[302:01.52]No more dumb voices.
[302:02.92]No more voices.
[302:03.68]I'm Gerber.
[302:04.16]I do voices.
[302:05.28]He's out there getting a big brain in the big school.
[302:07.60]Hope when he comes, big shot.
[302:09.52]He remembers us little guys down the street.
[302:13.26]Eating oranges and getting our stomachs pumped.
[302:15.18]What the fuck?
[302:17.28]Little Chrissy, like, what's up?
[302:19.65]Give Aunt Catty a hug.
[302:21.35]Mwah.
[302:22.51]Mwah, mwah.
[302:24.28]I'm not even actually your aunt.
[302:26.02]Oh my god, can I talk to you about something?
[302:28.68]Actually, like, anything, though.
[302:30.36]Your choice.
[302:32.38]Uh, Asriel.
[302:33.68]Oh my god, Asriel, like, what a cutie pie.
[302:35.96]Do you really remember when...
[302:40.34]Remember when me and him went to the dance?
[302:42.92]That was like the best night ever.
[302:44.78]Even though I spilled the entire punch bowl all over him and danced inappropriately in front of your mom.
[302:49.90]And got arrested in the parking lot for making a scene.
[302:52.04]That was so much fun.
[302:53.98]Tell him I said hi.
[302:58.35]Oh, Chris, like if you want to come in, our cat flap is like always open.
[303:10.89]Who else should I know?
[303:12.85]Nobody.
[303:14.19]Harsh, but fair.
[303:19.75]Hold on, I'm not done exploring.
[303:20.97]Oh, hi, Chris.
[303:24.64]Did you need help with your homework again?
[303:26.10]I know you were having trouble last time, so I actually got a few things ready for you.
[303:31.08]In case.
[303:32.16]Oh, wait, sorry, I can't right now.
[303:33.78]I forgot my house key again, and sorry, Chris.
[303:36.83]I'll help you later if that's okay.
[303:40.03]It's fine.
[303:40.77]See you at school, Chris.
[303:43.74]Chris, did you want to talk about something?
[303:49.57]Susie, that's right.
[303:50.43]You were with Susie when you didn't come back to class.
[303:53.19]I was worried, but everything turned out okay, I think.
[303:57.82]Uh, Chris, can I ask you something?
[303:59.48]If that's okay?
[304:00.94]Susie, I'm kind of curious what she's like, you know?
[304:03.62]I mean, who doesn't wonder about her?
[304:05.74]She never talks to anyone.
[304:07.42]So, Chris, could you tell me about her, if that's okay?
[304:13.83]She what?
[304:14.41]She smashed you against the lockers?
[304:16.93]Gosh, Chris, I'm really sorry.
[304:18.21]That's just awful.
[304:19.67]I thought she was good, just maybe it would take someone special to find her good side.
[304:27.09]But she really is terrible, isn't she?
[304:29.01]Chris, I'm so sorry.
[304:30.15]You have to go through with this.
[304:31.67]In fact, I wonder if... Do you think... I wonder if Alphys would let us switch partners.
[304:36.06]I mean, you know, so you wouldn't have to be the one who gets to be slammed into lockers and stuff anymore.
[304:42.98]Wait, I don't think I phrased that correctly.
[304:49.54]Alright.
[304:51.10]Have I done everything?
[304:51.96]DAD!
[304:59.17]Dumb dee dumb.
[305:00.17]Oh, it's someone there.
[305:01.85]Just a moment.
[305:03.32]I have almost finished watering these flowers.
[305:06.98]Here we are.
[305:09.98]Oh, howdy.
[305:10.48]How can I... Oh, hey, Chris.
[305:13.68]Oh, I'm sorry.
[305:19.34]I forgot if you don't like hugs like that.
[305:23.77]Well, now, make yourself at home, Chris.
[305:26.07]You can help yourself to anything you like.
[305:32.07]I don't understand.
[305:32.73]Is this supposed to be, like, before?
[305:36.93]Like, this is, like, the before.
[305:40.27]Flowey or Chad, whatever his name was.
[305:44.14]What's the character from the first game?
[305:45.42]Chaz?
[305:46.90]Chad?
[305:53.90]Sure.
[305:54.02]Uh-oh.
[305:54.36]Dad.
[305:54.50]Dad, get rid of this one.
[305:55.40]Dad, smash this one.
[305:56.39]Smash this one.
[305:56.81]It's a golden flower protected in a container.
[306:21.27]It's a yellow flower protected in a container.
[306:24.25]It's an orange flower protected in a container.
[306:26.07]It's a green flower protected in a container.
[306:29.78]It's a purple flower protected in a container.
[306:32.56]It's a blue flower protected in a container.
[306:35.66]It's a cyan flower protected in a container.

[306:54.17]It's a rusty fridge with some photos on it.
[306:57.69]Oh, if you're hungry, help yourself to anything you want to do.
[307:01.35]Open the fridge.
[307:02.69]All that's inside is a jar with a single pickle in it.
[307:05.13]You decide to pass.
[307:06.09]There's a small TV on top for some superhero comics.
[307:13.08]It's a door.
[307:13.60]It's locked.

[317:25.09]To be continued in chapter two.
[317:26.85]So I ripped out the heart.
[317:34.03]Interesting.
[317:37.56]Well.
[317:42.26]that's that's so okay um you could move around the cage I was I was the heart well I mean that's that's all right that was delta rune uh let me try I take care of this so here's uh the folder it's in I just want to make sure that nothing was in here because if you uninstall the game it can fuck it up so
[318:14.51]Okay.
[318:18.34]It's in here.
[318:22.56]There it is.
[318:41.76]The Jevil item.
[318:42.62]Oh, fuck.
[318:43.16]You're right.
[318:51.50]It's the only thing stopping me from making this joke.
[318:53.64]It's the Jevil item.
[318:58.33]I was about to do it.
[319:00.81]And then I realized that the Jevil item... Well, let's back it up a little bit here.
[319:05.82]I don't want to lose that.
[319:07.34]I don't want to lose that.
[319:09.94]Never mind.
[319:10.48]I'm not making this stupid joke anyways.
[319:23.79]You don't keep it.
[319:24.69]What do you mean I don't keep it?
[319:31.19]But, yeah, that was Deltarune.
[319:32.47]I'll give you what I think about it.
[319:34.85]Um... I think it was an interesting start.
[319:42.59]It's free.
[319:45.78]There really is... If you are a fan of Undertale... If you liked Undertale... I mean, like, what...
[319:55.08]Where's the harm in playing it?
[319:57.20]It's just free.
[319:58.84]Is the whole thing gonna be free?
[320:08.19]No, maybe not.
[320:08.77]Probably not.
[320:11.79]There's no way to know.
[320:15.59]I thought it was cute.
[320:17.87]I thought it was interesting.
[320:22.22]But without the whole experience, it's hard to be like, well, you know, there's my problem with what I think about the story.
[320:27.30]Like, I don't, how am I supposed to give you an opinion on that?
[320:35.11]Did I play the first game on stream?
[320:36.57]I did.
[320:37.51]Very long time ago.
[320:38.85]That was probably like, that was one of the first games I ever streamed in its entirety on Twitch, wasn't it?
[320:52.20]Chapter 2 is the rest of the game, and it's stated to be not free and scheduled for a 2025 release.
[320:58.30]2025.
[320:58.98]Is that... Are you... Are you opening up folders?
[321:03.57]To pretend to uninstall on me here?
[321:06.03]Or what?
[321:10.15]Okay, so... Okay, I get it.
[321:14.55]But anyways, um... So here's the deal.
[321:18.05]Uh...
[321:20.41]Over the next couple of days, I'm not going to stream.
[321:23.61]I have some stuff that I need to get done over the next couple of days.
[321:26.83]So nothing tomorrow, nothing on Tuesday.
[321:29.33]And then we're going to start up on Wednesday.
[321:34.90]I might stream on Tuesday, depends.
[321:36.96]If I can get everything that I want to get done, done.
[321:42.06]So nothing tomorrow, tentative for Tuesday.
[321:44.94]But you'll definitely see me again on Wednesday.
[321:46.36]Okay.
[321:50.79]Whenever the second part comes out, I will absolutely play it.
[321:53.31]I mean, I'm already invested in it, so why not?
[321:58.25]And, uh... The new Germa Rumble, Germania 2018, is probably going to happen exactly one week from today.
[322:06.23]I'm going to try to do it by Sunday.
[322:08.35]Got a lot of characters to make, so... I've already been preliminarily getting it ready, so... And that is going to conclude...
[322:20.18]tonight's stream.
[322:22.28]So, let's get to the bits.
[322:24.31]Thanks for sticking around.
[322:25.41]If you're heading out, I will see you at the very least on Wednesday.
[322:29.33]Have a great rest of your night.
[322:31.35]See you soon.
[322:33.67]And for the rest of you here, thank you to Jess Homeboy for the $1.
[322:42.14]Missed you big time.
[322:43.46]This is the first stream I've caught since you moved, as I haven't had internet for six weeks.
[322:46.98]Feels good to see you.
[322:48.68]I know what that's like.
[322:51.96]I know exactly what that is like.
[322:55.74]But thank you so much, man.
[323:01.35]Check hard.
[323:01.95]Yeah.

[324:37.48]He's just being a dick.
[324:39.62]I don't know.
[324:40.17]He's just kidding around.
[324:42.51]He's just kidding around.
[324:43.23]It's alright.
[324:43.65]Don't worry.
[324:45.69]Two and a half weeks, yeah.
[324:48.67]No new ideas.

[325:15.17]Very blessed.
[325:16.55]Thank you, Decomposer.
[325:20.91]See you in a few weeks when we play Fortnite.
[325:23.42]I'm never gonna play Fortnite.
[325:27.10]Fortnite could knock on my front door with a check for a million dollars.
[325:33.92]If I streamed Fortnite for six hours.
[325:37.78]And I would take it and I would just go... Abso-fucking-lutely.
[325:42.20]Because that's the easiest thing I would ever do in my life.
[325:45.01]So why the fuck would I not do that?
[325:51.97]Thank you, Mr. Sneakman, for the one dollar.
[325:54.79]Hey Jeremy, your streams and videos always help me get through life's challenges.
[325:57.93]Recently I've been kind of feeling the sophomore year slump, but your recent streams have made it a lot easier.
[326:03.88]On a much more serious note, sneak man for next week's Rumble or Absolute Riot.
[326:12.52]We'll see.
[326:17.80]He won't play Fortnite, but will gladly embarrass himself doing the dances on stream.
[326:23.94]Yeah, but that's like... That's like a phenomenon right now.
[326:29.32]It's not like Fortnite has 6,000 active players.
[326:33.86]There's like 600 million active players in that game.
[326:40.35]It's a cultural phenomenon.
[326:47.27]Phenomenon.
[326:48.93]Phenomenon.
[326:54.43]But, uh, thank you.
[326:58.78]Thank you, uh, to Zolderine.
[327:02.58]Zolderine.
[327:06.10]For the $5 here.
[327:09.32]Uh, I really want Fortnite.
[327:11.14]No, you... I'm not playing Fortnite right now.
[327:14.90]I'll delete your essay that you worked on for four weeks.
[327:17.11]No.
[327:21.25]You're not gonna delete your essay.
[327:23.82]Why would you do something like that?
[327:25.56]You worked so hard on that.
[327:27.52]Don't delete that because I won't play Fortnite.
[327:29.84]You just go play Fortnite.
[327:30.98]Just you go play Fortnite right now.
[327:33.12]And like here, watch.

[327:37.89]Get like Fraps or like Shadowplay or something.
[327:41.25]And just record the screen while you're playing Fortnite.
[327:43.89]And then just put this over that and then export it and watch it.
[327:51.01]Yeah, I think he's at the cube.
[327:53.76]Oh, watch out, watch out, he's building.
[327:55.30]They're all the way up there, man.

[331:19.50]That's my IMDB page.
[331:24.90]What the fuck?
[331:26.76]Uh, thank you, Decomposer, for the $4, they say.
[331:29.60]Uh, Pride.
[331:33.05]Pride, Pride, Pride.
[331:34.99]And then they say, my toes are wet.
[331:37.35]I don't, I don't know why that would, I don't know what's going on there.
[331:40.29]But, thank you, Decomposer, for the $4.
[331:45.69]Uh, Novi gave five community subs, thank you so much.
[331:49.69]DivUSP, thanks for $2 here.
[331:54.04]Devakitty, thanks for the $1.
[331:58.21]Derma, I'm regrettably not able to watch tonight because I'm playing through Undertale and I don't want to spoil Deltarune.
[332:04.43]So I just wanted to thank you for the green screen stream.
[332:07.35]Friday was an awful day because my appointment to get hormone replacement therapy got delayed to the 6th of December all the way to March 25th.
[332:17.74]So thank you for putting a smile on my face at my absolute lowest.
[332:24.19]Absolutely, Derma.
[332:26.23]I'm
[332:30.87]That's a big delay.
[332:31.57]That's a long time.
[332:39.20]But Undertale is a great game.
[332:41.28]I'm sure you are going to love it.
[332:44.36]Because I'm surprised you didn't get spoiled.
[332:50.31]Undertale is one of the hardest games to not get spoiled on.
[332:55.15]It really is.
[332:58.55]That's actually pretty remarkable, but... I'm sorry to hear about your woes here with having your appointment delayed.
[333:14.27]I spoiled it.
[333:15.43]I spoiled myself before I played it and I regret it.
[333:17.47]Yeah, it's definitely worth doing it the first time when you go through.
[333:25.23]It's an interesting experience.
[333:31.02]But, take care, Devakitty.
[333:33.22]Much love to you.
[333:39.12]Did I spoil it by watching this stream?
[333:41.84]Um... May... No.
[333:45.33]No, maybe.
[333:48.31]Yeah, maybe.
[333:49.17]No, I don't know.
[333:50.93]Yeah, you probably... Maybe.
[333:54.95]That's tough, because, like... Like, the whole... No, no, no, no.
[334:00.94]Just play Undertale and just play it like you just play the game.
[334:03.57]You know what I mean?
[334:06.07]Thank you, Dog Funeral, for the $10.
[334:08.91]Dog Funeral.
[334:11.09]Hey, Jerma.
[334:11.41]I've only been following your stream since earlier this year, but you've been endless sorts of entertainment and laughs for me watching you play Delta Roommate for a cozy Sunday night.
[334:19.18]Thank you for keeping me and countless others inspired.
[334:21.16]You're truly a great guy.
[334:22.06]Cheers.
[334:22.32]Hey.
[334:24.56]Cheers to you, Dog.
[334:26.39]Thank you.
[334:29.20]Yeah, I figured tonight was gonna be more of a just chill, relax, and enjoy a game, you know what I mean?
[334:43.52]But thank you so much for the $10.
[334:46.32]I did feel like cozy.
[334:48.72]Maybe I came off as angry tonight because I was cozy.
[334:52.78]You know, I'm like talking like this.
[334:54.46]I'm just kind of looking around like having fun.
[334:56.87]Did I sound angry?
[334:58.37]I mean, it was one guy, but someday you'll be the one guy.
[335:00.71]I felt pretty comfy.
[335:07.97]Ampharic and Pinman gave a shitload of subs.
[335:14.26]Community subs here.
[335:16.35]Back about four hours ago.
[335:18.11]Thank you guys so much.
[335:20.25]That's so many.
[335:21.91]And then Kairatobi gave 20.
[335:29.50]You guys are so generous.
[335:31.18]Pocket Pauling gave five.
[335:36.91]Thank you.
[335:40.68]We also had a dollar from Doubled11.
[335:44.29]Is there an estimate of how many characters there are going to be in the next Germania?
[335:49.09]I typically, when I do one of these, I like to make at least 15-ish to 20 new characters.
[335:58.00]And then 10 plus old ones.
[336:02.84]And then ones that I determine to be kind of not that relevant anymore get pushed out.
[336:09.64]So, it's essentially like the last year of streams and what characters did I like, what things did I think were funny, and then stuff from like two or three years ago that's just not going to be there anymore.
[336:24.51]It's kind of just not in the same relevancy as something that happened like two or three months ago.
[336:32.32]I mean, I'm not going to do any character reveals here.
[336:34.90]I already did one.
[336:37.28]But, uh, thank you.
[336:38.99]Thank you, March Kays.
[336:41.63]March Kays.
[336:43.93]For the $10.
[336:44.35]Thank you for $10.
[336:47.12]Hey, Germo.
[336:48.38]I don't have much to give you for all the help in these trying years.
[336:51.66]I fear that this might be the last stream for me.
[336:54.16]And I appreciate so much for the good moments in your stream, especially when I was at the hospital.
[336:58.12]You're a man of joy and kind.
[336:59.64]I hope you keep at it again.
[337:00.62]Thanks so much.
[337:06.59]This might be my last stream.
[337:10.57]What's, uh... What do you mean?
[337:30.25]I'm not sure if it's still here or not.
[337:35.04]But...
[337:38.10]Hopefully, if you have gone through an illness or something... I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[337:49.09]I would potentially like to know more, you know?
[338:00.33]But if... Let me see if they're still here.
[338:09.55]I'm trying to see... Let's see... Yes, it says they're still here.
[338:32.99]No, I used to... But, I mean... Whatever you mean by this, man, hopefully that...
[338:42.85]Hopefully you can either, I mean, it's hard to, without a lot of context, you know, I'm just, I'm really fucking sorry to hear about that.
[338:52.10]Whatever it is.
[338:59.08]Take care of yourself.
[339:00.83]If you're around and you can still chat in the Discord, I'm sure people would love to hear your story.
[339:05.23]You know what I mean?
[339:15.68]Yeah, it was March Kays.
[339:18.07]March Kays.
[339:19.53]Q-U-E-S.
[339:33.20]This community can be really great sometimes, even though we act like clowns.
[339:38.28]Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's a lot of really interesting, fun people here.
[339:53.63]You know what I mean?
[340:00.87]Well, hopefully... You know, it's tough to... It's tough to even say anything, you know what I mean?
[340:10.96]That's a very, very heavy statement.
[340:14.30]I feel fucking terrible.
[340:17.80]You know?
[340:18.30]Hopefully... Just, like, feel bad.
[340:24.90]I wish you the best.
[340:28.48]I wish you all the love in the world.
[340:34.71]Take care.
[340:46.72]Whiskey, whiskey.
[340:47.60]When am I going to get some more whiskey?
[340:49.11]Um, I don't have any here.
[340:58.91]Yeah, best of luck.
[341:00.39]Whatever it is you're going through, man.
[341:06.45]You have a whole community of people here that... support anybody that's here, so...
[341:15.69]He replied in chat already.
[341:16.70]Let's see.
[341:24.12]Uh, he said, I don't really like talking about it.
[341:26.99]Okay, yeah.
[341:27.95]Now then... They will leave it at that.
[341:34.27]But... Much love to you, dude.
[341:38.26]For real.
[341:45.58]We won't, like, pry, you know, there's no... I don't want to turn this into, like, something like that, so... Take care, March.

[343:38.03]The dryer is not stealable.
[343:44.57]You wouldn't be able to steal a dryer.
[343:47.32]Especially if it looks like a gas dryer.
[343:48.60]What are you going to do?
[343:49.16]Run up to the gas... Oh no, I was going to rip it out of the wall.
[343:51.68]Those things are like 500 pounds.

[351:56.79]Weird gamer brain.
[351:59.19]Thank you so much.

[352:12.86]That's probably... Like, it wasn't the... When Sans... The Sans fight, wasn't that the... Incredibly difficult, nearly impossible encounter?
[352:25.75]I never even attempted that.

[352:38.30]Really appreciate it.
[352:39.78]Thank you so much.

[353:07.30]Hey, Jeremy, the other night I had a dream where I was working in a restaurant and I saw you in the corner by yourself with an entire pie.
[353:12.84]You looked down at it angrily, picked it up and chucked it at the wall with your full strength and stood there silently while everyone looked in shock.
[353:20.45]Then I woke up.
[353:21.93]Why did you do that?
[353:24.74]I didn't get my fucking order right.
[353:30.00]I... I wanted a pecan pie and I got a chocolate cream.
[353:44.09]And that was the third time they screwed the order up.
[353:45.83]See, you came into the dream when I was already in the restaurant for 25 minutes.
[353:49.26]You don't have that context.
[353:50.68]You don't have... All you have is that little clip there of you waking up in that reality there.
[353:54.74]I was there for about 30 minutes waiting for different pies.
[353:59.26]And the manager was very rude to me.
[354:06.81]Do you know who I am?
[354:09.99]Thank you, Platin... Platin...

[354:35.30]Thanks.
[354:35.92]That means a lot.
[354:36.76]Thank you.
[354:40.26]Everyone calls me Platt.

[355:09.22]Thanks, Valuki, for the $1.
[355:10.16]Hey, Jerma, I don't feel like removing periods and commas to tell you an extremely short summary of what happened in our Castle Griffinsteed arc, so please read this on stream.
[355:19.35]It was the most fun I've had in our campaign yet.
[355:21.45]It was wonderful.
[355:23.03]Thanks for being such a creative and talented person.
[355:24.59]We love you almost as much as Carl.
[355:27.70]Alright, let's see.
[355:32.75]See, the party slayed Al'Goro and gave Trog a burial.
[355:36.27]They encountered the rabbit people and purchased everything from the shop.
[355:39.72]Malus the Goliath fired the ray gun and blew a hole in the shop's wall.
[355:44.08]They were soon chased out and encountered a horde of zombies.
[355:47.10]Coming face to face with Al'Goro, I threw a single stone and killed the demon in one hit.
[355:51.04]Upon reaching the final room, the wizard offered the party an answer to any question that they would ask, under the condition that it was one question.
[355:57.63]Asking what happened to Carl instead of asking about the two people we came to the castle to save, the shotgun picked up by Malus was pulled from his hand and blew a hole into the wizard's chest.
[356:07.63]Reality began to distort around him as the party found themselves floating on a single platform in a red cosmic void, staring down at Carl himself.
[356:14.43]Cursed by a powerful ring, Carl attacked the party.
[356:17.69]Driven by greed to find more chips, it pulled the ring from Carl's finger and Carl dissolved into smoke before the entire dungeon began to warp and collapse in on itself.
[356:26.40]running out the party narrowly escaped and returned to town to inform the barbarians of trogg's defeat then the barbarians got absolutely pissed absolutely pissed for disturbing the ritual of the warrior's harvest with that we completed the castle griffin's deed all in all carl became a corrupt god driven by greed for chips and was soon dealt with after being found we love you derma that sounds like a pretty fitting end
[356:56.71]Why didn't you ask if the wizard eats ass?
[357:02.51]I'm glad you had fun on your campaign.
[357:08.17]Sounds like a good time.
[357:11.87]Say goodnight to me.
[357:13.43]Goodnight, Fox.
[357:14.57]Goodnight.
[357:14.91]See?
[357:15.09]See?
[357:15.55]The one guy.
[357:17.11]There you go.
[357:19.35]Goodnight, Fox.
[357:20.27]Have a great rest of your night.
[357:24.40]But thank you, Voluki.
[357:27.97]Sounds like an interesting time.
[357:31.08]Hey, Genieboy, thanks for the $1.
[357:32.32]Hey, Jeremy, I'm a few minutes behind on this one, but thanks for granting us such a breathtaking performance in your first and also last battle against Jevil.
[357:40.50]It was, without exaggeration, one of the most epic moments I've witnessed on Twitch.
[357:44.59]Dermajacks times two.
[357:46.89]Cheers to that.
[357:48.21]Cheers, guy.
[357:51.99]EatDeBurger, thanks for the $2 here.
[357:56.20]Uh, they say, top 10 meme streams.
[357:59.72]Thank, uh, what?
[358:01.70]Should I be happy about that?
[358:03.40]Or should I be very, very disappointed?
[358:06.22]Uh, they also say, oh, Gerber, it's been like eight months since I watched a stream live.
[358:09.44]Why are you playing Undertale Part 4?
[358:15.97]Thank you.
[358:17.45]Thank you, Darkstar, 700,000 games for the $1.

[358:27.93]Thank you also to Garfield the Monday Killer.
[358:32.46]Gar found lost Undertale footage.
[358:34.25]Give your funniest commentary.
[358:35.65]Chat will never forgive me for this one.
[358:42.27]If I get gnomed, I'm making the minimum bits $5.
[359:07.19]I was like laughing about that one a little bit.
[359:09.67]You mean the German 985 who had his house infested by wasps?
[359:13.77]So like when a wasp went in his room, he was like, you know, going on diet.
[359:17.33]It's not that big of a... Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[359:19.33]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[359:20.73]Then he snaps his finger, the wasp blows up, his house blows up, and then he goes, ooh, up in smoke.
[359:26.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, the virus.
[359:27.78]The virus.
[359:28.24]I just had like the weirdest thought right now.
[359:29.80]What if Garfield...
[359:31.58]I'm waiting for a gnome.
[359:51.34]his graphographs and then he's gonna send it to him at the end of the delta rune stream yeah that's exactly what I'm saying well that's kind of lame like like we're just standing here talking about germa and like that constitutes putting us in a video and then wasting germa's time on stream to watch this this garbage yeah dude something's gotta happen to make it a little bit more fun you know yeah bro something has to happen to oh no that's
[360:16.94]I don't feel so good.
[360:17.65]Hey, hey, the pirates, you alright, dude?
[360:19.85]I don't... I don't know.
[360:21.61]I don't know what's happening.
[360:22.89]You guys can't even see this.
[360:24.81]I don't want to go.
[360:26.01]I don't want to go.
[360:26.67]Mr. Sands, please, please.
[360:29.02]I don't want to go.
[360:29.68]I don't want to go.
[360:31.02]I'm sorry.
[360:38.50]He just disappeared.
[360:39.06]No gnome.
[360:39.42]Everyone's safe now.
[360:40.34]I watched the whole thing.
[360:41.50]Because I was waiting for the gnome.
[360:42.62]There's the video.
[361:13.34]It's not a gnome.
[361:14.90]Well, it's okay.
[361:16.68]It's okay.
[361:18.60]Thank you, Garfield, for... The voice work was actually pretty good.
[361:27.11]Garfield sure does know a lot of actors, apparently.
[361:31.73]Hey, ExtraCheesy!
[361:32.75]Thanks for the $5, ExtraCheesy.
[361:34.11]Jeremiah, I had to drive a car for a long time and missed the stream.
[361:36.41]You've gotta say something funny or I'll have a top-tier comedy withdrawal.
[361:42.66]Ah, that was 42 minutes ago.
[361:44.15]I think I may have said something funny.
[361:47.97]Bring it back.
[361:48.39]Let's see.
[361:52.05]Top tier comedy.
[361:56.00]Thank you, Extra Cheesy, for the $5.
[361:58.00]Welcome back.
[361:59.26]Hey, Cobra Cat, thanks for the $4.

[362:04.75]Hope you have a great Monday.
[362:07.65]Uh, Iron Gunner, thanks for the $1.

[362:13.15]And thank you for the monetary contribution.
[362:14.75]That's a dollar from you, Iron.
[362:15.91]Thank you so much.
[362:18.17]Uh, Kroski, thank you, Kroski, for the $1.
[362:20.51]Hey, Jerma, love your streams and have recently been subbed for a bit.
[362:22.80]By the way, if you didn't notice, Deltarune is just Undertale spelled backwards.
[362:26.72]Thanks again.
[362:27.16]Inner... No, it's not.
[362:34.84]That's not it.
[362:40.05]It's not.
[362:41.13]I'm just saying that.
[362:46.50]It's an anagram.
[362:50.62]Oh, wow!
[362:59.81]No, thanks.
[363:01.11]Hey, Gonderlane, thanks for the $1.
[363:02.26]I'm still waiting on a Bookworm Adventures, Jerma.
[363:04.80]Stream that game and I'll be forever happy.
[363:07.14]Give it your famous quote, I'll look into it and look into it when you probably don't look into it, but now you say you will because I said this, but you still won't look into it, but will just say, okay, now I'll look into it, but probably still won't, and now you'll feel guilty for just play it soon.
[363:26.25]I'll look into that.
[363:27.03]I'll take a look at it.
[363:27.95]Thank you.
[363:29.86]Thank you, TheMemePolice, for the $5.
[363:31.54]Jeremiah, I'm so happy to catch your stream today.
[363:34.85]Love this game.
[363:35.81]Things have been horrible recently for me.
[363:37.63]But your streams and videos have made my days better.
[363:40.07]Going back to the old TF2 days.
[363:41.45]Thank you.
[363:43.99]Thank you, TheMemePolice, for the $5.
[363:46.25]Sorry to hear about your recent troubles.
[363:50.14]But... Being around from the old TF2 days, that's a long time ago.
[363:54.92]Thanks for sticking with me.
[363:58.30]Much love to you.
[364:00.00]For real.
[364:02.12]I say that often, but for real, guys.
[364:11.17]Is Sans gonna be in the next German Rumble?
[364:12.89]Yeah.
[364:15.21]Sure.
[364:15.75]Fine.
[364:19.17]I wasn't planning... I guess.
[364:32.86]Anyways, thank you, Gondolin.
[364:34.40]Thank you, TheMemePolice.
[364:35.44]And thank you, CobaCat, for the $1.

[364:41.82]Thank you, CobaCat.
[364:43.48]Mostly lost.
[364:44.10]Thanks for the $1.
[364:44.92]Tens of thousands of bits later and you still can't pronounce Div's name right.
[364:49.38]German disgust.
[364:50.52]It's DivUSP, man.
[364:53.69]He's Div.
[364:55.05]Div.
[364:57.21]DivUSP.
[365:03.13]Divus.
[365:10.96]It's not abbreviated.
[365:11.94]It's not USP.
[365:20.52]It's Divus P. Divus P. I don't want to correct you because I don't want to come off rude.
[365:26.81]No, don't.
[365:27.87]I see it and I read it.
[365:30.65]Divus P.
[365:34.85]So is it divus P or is it divus P?
[365:38.27]Like, uh, I or IH?
[365:41.03]Divus?
[365:47.61]Divus.
[365:48.77]Okay.
[365:50.03]So I got div.
[365:52.33]I got the div correct.
[365:55.84]But thank you.
[365:56.72]Thank you, divus.
[365:58.22]Divus P.
[366:02.54]for your correction.
[366:04.18]I will make sure I say it wrong again.
[366:06.94]Definitely gonna say it wrong again.
[366:10.45]But thank you, Mostly Lost, for the correction, actually.
[366:12.73]Uh, IVCats, IVCaz, thank you for the one dollar.

[366:23.66]It's time for slime, thanks for the one dollar.
[366:24.96]Stop playing new games so I can watch your streams again.
[366:29.50]Uh, we're almost done with the new games.
[366:33.78]There's not much left.
[366:36.30]I might return to Red Dead or Hitman.
[366:40.23]Because I still want to do some of the other missions.
[366:41.91]I felt like that was a lot of fun.
[366:45.95]We'll see.

[372:20.29]Thanks for the $1.
[372:20.93]Hey, German, just want to let you know that I used audio from your green screen stream as part of my film class project this week, and I got an A for it.
[372:27.79]I basically made a cyberpunk trailer with you as the narrator.
[372:31.42]It all got spun from you talking about the virtual world.
[372:39.05]Well, I'm glad you got an A. Thanks a lot, voice boy.
[372:46.62]Keep at it.
[372:48.30]Hey, Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[372:49.70]Please gross... Please gross out your beard.
[372:52.74]You look really good with it.
[372:56.14]Grow out?
[372:57.24]Gross out?
[373:00.56]I can't grow a beard.
[373:01.36]After about a week, it turns to absolute dog shit.
[373:04.55]I look terrible.
[373:05.75]I can't do it.
[373:06.19]I look so bad.
[373:11.45]IvyCazTV, thanks for the two bucks.
[373:13.15]You made the long night's well worth from my time in SERT during my time for relief support down on the coast during the hurricane.
[373:22.52]I'm happy to be here and thinking of what's going on here instead of what I saw there.
[373:28.00]Always know you are great.
[373:29.28]Thank you.
[373:31.98]Thank you, IvyCaz.
[373:38.56]And thank you for
[373:45.01]for that.
[373:52.12]That's tough.
[373:53.96]That's really fucking tough.
[374:02.33]I... have nothing but respect for people that help others, so...
[374:19.20]Much love to you, for real.
[374:26.00]32-year-old child can't grow beard.
[374:30.32]I can't.
[374:34.36]But you're always welcome in this community, everybody is, anyone is.
[374:45.58]Thank you.
[374:45.88]It's alright.
[374:48.76]It's alright.
[374:49.02]Just, like, grow a beard and come back to me.
[374:50.82]We'll talk.
[375:12.03]Thank you Guessing2 for the $11.
[375:14.37]Can't catch streams anymore because of a new job.
[375:16.49]Here's an hour of my time in return for all of yours.
[375:21.59]Thank you Guessing2.
[375:26.70]Congratulations on the new job.
[375:32.14]Hope you make some money.
[375:40.92]Thank you for being here.
[375:46.35]Where's the job?
[375:50.65]Well, not like, where, but like, what?
[375:51.83]Like, not like, wait, wait, wait.
[375:53.25]Where do you work?
[375:54.21]Where's it?
[375:55.55]Like, what?
[376:01.58]Jeremy, don't be such a boy.
[376:03.74]What?
[376:09.12]Thank you, Glitchbird, for the $1.
[376:10.51]I only started watching your stuff in early 2017 during some shitty times in my life, which is also when I started to get into TF2.
[376:18.93]Stuck around because your content is genuinely some of the best.
[376:20.89]I know you'll probably never go back to TF2, but that doesn't matter because you're able to make fucking cardboard.
[376:25.78]Hilarious.
[376:28.78]Debatable.
[376:30.06]And that says a lot.
[376:31.00]Also, I'm still in shock over Jevil.
[376:32.92]That was amazing.
[376:37.88]Thank you.
[376:39.52]Team Fortress 2 started me down this road.
[376:43.89]And sometimes I kind of look back in the rear view and see how it's doing.
[376:51.12]Thanks for being around for this long.
[377:04.30]Because we're talking about 2017, 2018, like two years, three years.
[377:12.62]I'm shocked and surprised and humbled and thankful that there are people that have opened up this stream and opened up these videos for a year, two years, three years, four years, and you're still here.
[377:32.53]Thank you.
[377:35.40]All those people that probably knew you from the server.
[377:47.57]Thank you, Glitchburn.
[377:49.16]And then finally here at the end, we've got MooMeansMoo for a dollar and ChubbyFunster for a dollar.
[377:53.90]And Moo says, also just want to say that even though work and life stuff keeps me busy to catch most of the streams these days, I owe a lot of these streams and to this community.
[378:03.30]Watching these streams and getting the chance to be mod for the swell community got me through some not fun times.
[378:09.36]And now that things have leveled out, just want to say thanks for everything.
[378:12.46]Chairman Hart.
[378:15.06]Thank you, Moo.
[378:17.93]You've been around for a long time.
[378:20.90]You got a lot of creative, funny energy up there, man.
[378:25.66]Glad to have you.
[378:28.56]Thank you.
[378:33.35]Glad that things have started to level up for you.
[378:40.01]And finally, Chubby Funster, Jeremiah, I meant grow, not gross, but my words are not so good.
[378:44.60]Me not so good.
[378:45.58]Me not like fire.
[378:47.64]Uh, what is this?
[378:48.50]What the fuck is this bit?
[378:50.78]Message.
[378:51.16]Oh, thank you.
[378:58.57]Uh, Extra Cheesy, thanks for a dollar.
[379:00.03]Hi, it's me again.
[379:00.75]Okay, I guess you did say something funny.
[379:02.29]I take it all back.
[379:03.02]I'm sorry.
[379:07.88]Apology accepted.
[379:09.82]And here come the... Oh my god, how many subs were there?
[379:21.57]You guys are fucking... Every day.
[379:38.72]The Javel fight resulted in like 20 plus subs.
[379:41.54]I think it was more than that.
[379:42.48]I think it was like 40.
[379:53.68]There are a lot of fucking people subscribed to this channel.
[380:01.66]A lot.
[380:07.84]And there's a lot of new viewers too.
[380:11.50]I've noticed that too.
[380:17.16]Thank you for taking the ride.
[380:18.02]Hopefully you stay on.
[380:25.91]It's crazy because I see a lot of familiar faces in the chat and subs too.
[380:32.77]And equally, new faces, new subs, and new people.
[380:45.66]I've been watching your YouTube videos for years, but I finally jumped into your Twitch streams.
[380:49.00]Welcome.
[380:52.10]I'm going to keep doing it.
[380:53.36]I'm going to just keep doing what we do.
[381:00.52]As long as I'm continuing to have fun, as long as you guys are having fun, then let's keep going.
[381:05.84]Fuck it.
[381:06.10]You know what I mean?
[381:07.92]I want to try and do as much as I can.
[381:15.29]I want to try to do the best job that I possibly can.
[381:26.07]And that's something that I really, truly mean.
[381:31.87]So let's go.
[381:32.39]Fucking get the gas in the container, you know what I mean?
[381:37.52]Let's step on that gas.
[381:40.18]Top 1000?
[381:40.46]Uh-uh.
[381:45.17]See you on the goddamn moon!
[381:49.62]We're gonna get to at least top 780.
[381:51.88]That's right!
[382:06.83]Thank you, all of you.
[382:07.59]I know I don't read subs anymore.
[382:14.49]But it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate it.
[382:19.13]Because all of you guys that watch and sub and pay money to this stream, you are the blood that runs through the veins of the channel.
[382:38.79]I'm blood now.
[382:41.93]Blood is incredibly important.
[382:44.07]Because without blood, you just got a skeleton.
[382:48.25]That's it.
[382:49.91]You're just blood and skeleton.
[382:53.52]And a little bit of skin.
[382:59.66]And right at the end here, before we go, I'll see you guys probably on Wednesday.
[383:05.41]If I see you on Tuesday, then we'll see where we are.
[383:07.97]I don't have a schedule yet.
[383:14.05]See what that ends up being.
[383:17.44]But Convo Breaker, thanks for the $1.
[383:18.80]Hey Jeremy, just wanted to say that I've been watching you since the Beggar's Bazooka sneeze video, which I didn't watch for like two years because it sounded more like coughing than it did sneezing, and that pissed me off to the point of almost deciding to never watch you again.
[383:33.82]I'm glad I actually decided to watch you.
[383:35.46]Also, please play Pyre.
[383:37.28]Air Bud with a mustache is there.
[383:43.70]Oh.
[383:47.91]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.
[383:49.55]There's a clip.
[383:56.05]This is Vinny.
[384:03.84]Okay, here we are.
[384:04.80]This is the teleporter we will use to enter the alien base.
[384:10.00]Quite a realistic-looking ca- What the fuck am I playing-
[384:13.14]We are running out of time.
[384:14.84]Follow me.
[384:16.48]I don't get it.
[384:21.48]Vinny's a really funny, really great dude, but what's the context here?
[384:28.21]I mean, this is the clip.
[384:38.17]Hey, thank you also to IvyCastTV again for a dollar.
[384:41.34]Thank you for your kind words, my friend.
[384:43.70]I love you and everyone else here.
[384:44.88]Thank you for everything, everyone, especially you.
[384:46.86]You do wonders.
[384:48.94]Goes both ways.
[384:50.67]Thank you.
[384:51.69]And then little light of mine.
[384:53.05]Thank you.
[384:54.09]Thank you.
[384:56.97]And that's going to end the stream.
[384:59.41]See you guys soon.
[385:00.27]Delta Room was fun.
[385:02.46]That was comfy.
[385:09.57]Most of the lost thanks for the 99 cents.
[385:11.28]Shouldn't even be reading this.
[385:13.80]Thank you.
[385:15.78]Thank you for the 99 cents.
[385:20.74]Thank you.
[385:21.02]Good night, everybody.
[385:22.52]See you soon.
[385:23.91]Probably Tuesday or Wednesday.
[385:26.77]Good night.
[385:45.07]Give chat a goodnight kiss.
[385:46.51]Says moo means moo.
[385:50.35]Goodnight, chat.
[386:06.59]That was me turning the light off in the room.
[386:08.91]Goodnight.
[386:09.65]Goodnight, family.
