[00:21.67]No intro, no ads.
[00:22.59]It's at
[00:28.17]I can't say it's ad-free because you're going to get pre-rolls.
[00:31.04]Sorry.
[00:32.30]That's the way it is, unfortunately.
[00:33.40]Hey!
[00:38.44]What do I look like?
[00:40.91]You have no neck.
[00:43.89]Here, look at this.
[00:46.81]That's what, you know, I look like.
[00:51.62]Very nice graphics.
[00:53.68]Cool.
[00:54.61]I think we're just waiting for Ster.
[00:56.49]Where did Ster go?
[00:57.75]Ster was, like, ready to go, but he's gone now.
[01:00.99]You know what?
[01:02.05]You know who you look like?
[01:03.01]Your character looks like Paul McCartney just during the beginning of the recording of the Sgt.
[01:08.44]Pepper album.
[01:11.88]I shouldn't know that, but I do.
[01:13.30]That's wildly specific, and I love it.
[01:15.88]Yeah.
[01:16.52]Let me just get my chat up.
[01:17.38]It's specific, and I love it.
[01:21.43]I heard my sausage teeth.
[01:24.04]Yeah, I think Poke was getting coffee.
[01:25.94]Yo, I made coffee.
[01:27.06]Hey, I got coffee too.
[01:28.28]Poke, what'd you get?
[01:29.00]What kind of coffee?
[01:30.23]Just normal coffee.
[01:32.09]Tim Horton's Keurig.
[01:33.55]Did you say Tim Horton's?
[01:36.35]Yeah, they have the little Keurig cups.
[01:39.63]You're going to have to have a conversation with Ster.
[01:42.73]He doesn't like Keurig, right?
[01:44.20]I think he just, he does not like Tim Hortons.
[01:46.84]He went off on this crazy tangent.
[01:49.20]I'm going to have a chat with Ster as well.
[01:53.55]We do not care.
[01:54.33]You got to back me up.
[01:58.03]I don't love it.
[01:58.96]You don't like Tim Hortons?
[02:00.38]It's fine.
[02:01.14]I like their pastries better than their coffee.
[02:04.84]I don't know if I could be here I did okay uh we need to eat by the way we would we have a source of food we need to eat it's like this I'd bear they're in like the sink right now how do I get this out of here how do I get this out oh

[02:34.50]Alright, Poke.
[02:36.08]Do you get the lobby info?
[02:39.02]Yeah.
[02:39.62]I don't see it, though.
[02:42.67]Beta, right?
[02:43.35]Hold on.
[02:43.89]Yeah, it's like the latest beta, and then... I think you have to be in the game, and then you go to multiplayer in the game, and then you should see that name, and then that's the PW password.
[02:57.10]Like Mr. Fantastic...
[03:00.15]Oh shit, it's going to be night time.
[03:06.59]Who wants to hold the flashlight?
[03:08.35]Charm, am I dead?
[03:12.69]Oh, okay.
[03:13.27]I see it now.
[03:14.39]How do I get up?
[03:18.09]You weren't dead.
[03:18.89]You were really... It was really... Did you just turn my light off?
[03:22.95]Oh, that's weird.
[03:23.79]I can do that?
[03:24.35]Hey, get out of here.
[03:25.37]I think, folks, you just joined?
[03:29.68]Wrong password got timed out.
[03:30.88]Okay, let me try again.
[03:31.52]That happened to me too.
[03:33.92]That happened to him too.
[03:35.86]Yeah, it might be a little glitchy.
[03:39.01]Oh, let me make sure.
[03:40.03]Let me not leak this.
[03:43.15]Vinny, please be aware there's a second camera you can place wherever you want.
[03:46.37]How do you do that, chat member?
[03:48.49]What the fuck was that?
[03:50.65]Oh, you guys hear that?
[03:51.45]My bad.
[03:52.03]Oh my god.
[03:52.69]Was that loud?
[03:54.90]That was pretty loud.
[03:55.76]Yeah.
[03:56.56]Oh my god.
[03:58.01]I'm so sorry.
[03:58.67]It'll never happen again.
[03:59.41]Was that a bird?
[04:02.01]Yes.
[04:02.49]Where is Stirr?
[04:03.51]What kind of bird is it?
[04:04.61]I like birds.
[04:05.29]It's a random alert.
[04:06.93]Sorry.
[04:07.45]Turn these lights on so we can see what we're doing.
[04:12.78]Is Stirr like here?
[04:14.40]Stirr was the first one live.
[04:16.36]Stirr was live and now he's gone.
[04:20.12]What has happened?
[04:21.36]I think he's making his character.
[04:22.30]Oh.
[04:24.60]Yeah, we're ready for The Long Drive.
[04:27.07]You have a couple options for character, so I just chose green.
[04:31.51]Okay, let's put some ground rules down here.
[04:34.65]This is going to run like dog shit.
[04:37.79]Make sure everyone, we're all aware of that.
[04:39.67]It's a miracle we're all in the game at the same time.
[04:43.68]Yeah, I'm worried, but I'm ready.
[04:46.72]I think we'll be alright.
[04:49.04]Hold caps lock and scroll your mouse wheel.
[04:54.26]But Poke, you've played this game before.

[05:21.50]That is the listed lobby.
[05:23.44]I gave the name.
[05:25.78]And then you need to type the password and you're going to get kicked out.
[05:29.22]Then you're going to try it again and you're going to be good.
[05:33.91]Folk, how do you do that?

[12:37.29]A man has been reported of chatting till he died.
[12:41.05]Okay, so going on a long drive is just your drive, you understand?
[12:45.15]I like it pretty much.

[13:15.05]What did we hit?
[13:18.41]Holy smokes!
[13:20.17]Wait, I think we're going the wrong way.
[13:24.29]We're going the wrong way?
[13:25.45]Yeah, we're going the wrong way.
[13:27.87]You see that sign back there?
[13:29.44]Yeah, I think the lights are supposed to be on the right side.
[13:33.38]Wait, actually, I don't know.
[13:34.62]Be careful.
[13:35.32]What fell out of the car?
[13:38.48]That was the back.
[13:41.76]Like the back door.
[13:43.46]It's gone now.
[13:44.04]It was an accident.
[13:45.72]Wow.

[14:05.15]If you press C, you get third person.
[14:08.15]Whoa!
[14:08.95]What is going on?
[14:10.19]If you hold C, it just stays third person.
[14:12.83]Oh, there's a house here.
[14:13.55]You want to check it out?
[14:14.49]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:15.39]Why am I not driving the car anymore?
[14:17.16]That's where we started.
[14:19.00]No, let's check it out.
[14:19.78]It could be anything there.
[14:20.56]It could be loot.

[14:35.90]That's the thing we just came from.
[14:38.24]Yeah, I bet we can get some cool stuff in there.
[14:39.96]No, let's just... Can we stay on the road, please?
[14:42.54]Better than it lets me touch people.
[14:43.74]I know that sounds weird, but... How do you pop your eyes out?
[14:49.20]Uh, I think it's Z. Um... Also, by the way... Alt.
[14:55.19]Yeah, press Alt and move your mouse, Viddy.

[15:03.51]Cut the shit up back there!
[15:04.55]Wait, can we cover him?
[15:08.11]There's a bunch of kids, like, fighting in the back of the car.
[15:10.01]We haven't lost his vision!
[15:10.77]We haven't lost his vision!
[15:11.71]We haven't made it one mile.
[15:15.27]I'll pull this car over right now, so help me God.
[15:22.24]You better get your fucking hands off me!
[15:25.66]Can you actually not see?
[15:26.98]I can't see anything.
[15:27.96]Actually, it's hard to see.
[15:32.27]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[15:33.65]Oh, God.
[15:34.19]Oh, it's so, so janky.
[15:37.14]Come on.

[15:45.24]I'm not kidding, by the way.
[15:47.36]This is the shit next to me.
[15:52.29]Stop doing that.
[15:58.51]It's sunny.

[18:23.57]I'm on a roller coaster.
[18:24.85]Why am I so fast?
[18:27.72]Jerma, what did you do to us?
[18:29.60]Jerma, what are you doing?
[18:30.20]I don't know what's happening.
[18:34.56]I am no-clipping now.
[18:35.62]Why are you in the car?
[18:36.50]I am a god.
[18:37.84]What?
[18:38.16]They just disappeared.
[18:39.12]They just disappeared.
[18:41.44]We're gonna shove them in the fridge.
[18:43.29]Is someone else in the car with me?
[18:44.45]Oh my god!
[18:46.91]I don't know how to get out!
[18:48.09]I don't know how to get out!
[18:49.35]Oh, Caps Lock.
[18:50.27]Oh, Caps Lock says no-clip.
[18:53.07]That's just allowed?
[18:54.39]What the fuck?
[18:55.15]Wait, what?
[18:56.87]Are you no-clipping for real?
[18:58.56]Yeah, apparently you can just press Caps Lock and then you just no-clip.
[19:01.58]What?
[19:01.80]Not for me!
[19:02.30]Who the fuck is this?
[19:06.78]I guess I was no-clipping.
[19:07.80]Who is this?
[19:09.54]You can turn that off in the settings.
[19:11.14]Okay, we just won't use it.
[19:11.86]Is this a person in our game?
[19:12.77]It's a strange sniper.
[19:13.57]Um...
[19:15.50]I'm in the middle of the field.
[19:18.28]And I don't know how to... I don't know if I cloned the car.
[19:22.06]Dude, this is... I feel like I'm playing DayZ.
[19:29.62]There are, like, people up here, like, in the other building.
[19:35.25]I... You were saying, where's the monsters?
[19:38.33]Where's the monsters?
[19:39.09]Now you see a monster.
[19:40.05]The monsters is humans.
[19:41.93]Yeah.

[19:50.23]He's free.
[19:50.67]He's coming to us.
[19:51.39]He does damage.
[19:53.07]How do we fight?
[19:56.23]What the fuck?
[19:59.35]Hit him.
[19:59.59]Hurt him.
[20:00.37]Where's the driver?
[20:01.11]Hit him with the car.
[20:01.87]I don't know how to.
[20:07.18]Um...

[20:38.35]Vinny's in the floor.
[20:39.47]Poke, you killed that guy in one hit.
[20:40.67]I thought that was a player.
[20:41.77]I thought that was another stream sniper or something.
[20:46.20]What do we do with this guy?
[20:50.32]It's okay.
[20:50.76]He's just a dude.
[20:51.30]I think he's dead now, right?
[20:52.74]So we could just leave his rotting corpse.
[20:54.74]We should bring him.
[20:55.28]We should eat him or we should bring him.
[20:57.86]Bro, this car is stuck in the wall.
[20:59.42]You never forget your first.
[21:03.21]You know about that?
[21:06.47]yeah okay the car there's an issue with the car we don't have one we need to survive here and then try to find another car what if we just pull the car through the wall how do I stop smoking cigarettes well they're very addicting you should not have started
[21:34.54]Uh, Vinny, you have to... You killed me.
[21:39.42]Sorry.
[21:40.86]Fuck.

[21:44.77]It's okay, you're gonna respawn nearby.
[21:46.33]It's gonna be great.
[21:47.35]I think I'm helping.
[21:48.27]I'll push, I'll push.
[21:50.27]Oh, my fucking head hurts already.
[21:52.91]You said I could noclip?
[21:55.27]Uh, Caps Locks was toggling it, I think.
[21:58.42]Can you noclip the car out?
[22:01.32]If you drive it?
[22:03.57]Uh, dude, press noclip, and then it's shift.
[22:06.83]Like, it's teleporting me around the world.
[22:10.84]Alright, well, don't cheat.
[22:12.22]It doesn't work for me.
[22:15.86]Oh my god, I just got teleported.
[22:17.70]I think we're here forever if we don't get a car.
[22:20.60]Okay.
[22:21.44]Or this is about to be the long walk.
[22:24.30]Without noclip enabled.
[22:25.14]I actually can't get out of the car.
[22:28.03]I'm stuck in the air car.
[22:29.03]What if we push it?
[22:30.89]Can we, like, rock it?
[22:36.89]Oh, it's in my settings.
[22:40.09]We're getting it.
[22:43.37]It's kind of, it's up here, like the top part of the car.
[22:47.54]Oh, there we go.
[22:48.22]There we go.
[22:49.06]Oh, I got it.
[22:49.56]Alright.
[22:51.56]It's missing wheels.
[22:54.22]It's missing a lot of parts.
[22:55.60]It looks like a spaceship.
[22:57.97]Can you guys flip it?
[22:58.77]I'm still stuck.
[23:00.17]Do we have any spare parts?
[23:02.87]Wait, everyone press V. Everyone hold V.
[23:06.71]No.
[23:08.57]I want to be awake.
[23:10.23]Why?
[23:10.49]It's nighttime.
[23:11.19]Is it nighttime for you or no?
[23:12.53]I think because I'm the host, I think I just made it daytime.
[23:17.96]This car is not driving anymore, by the way.
[23:20.10]Like, that's not going to be a vehicle we drive.
[23:23.26]Um... Oh my god.
[23:25.32]I mean, it could be if we just throw a wheel on it, like one.
[23:29.16]You need to get wheels?
[23:30.84]I'm talking in-game still?
[23:33.36]Wait, are you?
[23:34.54]Help!
[23:35.92]help I I have I just discovered my quirk and I can't control it yet okay I can put this tire on oh I know how can we get the refrigerator out of the car I'm good okay hold on I don't think I can
[24:00.51]Yeah, I don't think, maybe not then.
[24:02.55]No, I think we're done.
[24:03.97]I can't look left and right now.
[24:08.73]We could just reset it.
[24:10.33]Just reset the server?
[24:13.02]Start over?
[24:14.56]Yeah.
[24:14.90]Yeah, I think we're hopeless.
[24:18.26]Yeah, maybe we turn off the no clip setting my chat was saying.
[24:21.38]That might be helpful.
[24:22.22]Yeah, absolutely.
[24:23.20]Okay, let's reconvene.
[24:24.62]I'll remake it.
[24:28.47]I will put a new thing in there.
[24:30.71]Alright, so the settings you say it's there's a noclip.
[24:39.24]Developer mode, my chat saying.
[24:42.14]How do you get to developer mode?
[24:44.10]I don't know.
[24:46.98]Alright, new seed making random.
[24:53.34]Default map that's good start.
[25:01.43]Can you disable the screaming?
[25:04.09]No.
[25:05.85]This is the best part of the game so far.
[25:07.36]Okay.
[25:13.86]I feel like we're going to end up needing the no clip, but I just keep accidentally pressing buttons and teleporting through the world.
[25:19.17]Same password, same everything.
[25:20.75]This should be all set up again.
[25:23.25]Enable adult content?

[26:50.31]Everything about it.
[26:50.83]Alright, we need to make sure this time we're going to take it seriously.
[26:57.40]Yeah.

[27:03.56]Alright, let me fucking take care of that dome of yours.
[27:08.36]I actually just cleaned you.
[27:09.52]You're like shiny now.
[27:11.10]I didn't want to do this, but I have to.
[27:14.34]Over here.
[27:14.64]What is this?
[27:16.78]Play The Long Drive?
[27:19.68]Ride the shovel.
[27:20.92]What the hell is this?
[27:30.23]How did you do that?
[27:33.63]You look so funny trying to get in here.
[27:36.15]You look like a spider.
[27:38.32]Let's all go live in the crawl space together.
[27:41.34]I can't get in.
[27:43.18]Try more.
[27:44.12]You can definitely do it.
[27:45.48]Scroll the basketball down.
[27:48.32]Oh.
[27:49.26]I don't know what's happening right now.
[27:50.42]I did not know that.
[27:52.22]Well, Vinny, you're not involved.
[27:54.90]No, I'm not.
[27:55.78]It's not that I'm not involved.
[27:56.87]It's like I'm under the world right now.
[27:58.53]Because I'm riding a shovel.
[28:02.67]There's a bike.
[28:06.10]So Jermos is not coming to see this?
[28:08.12]I'm above.
[28:11.67]If we could all just springboard me out of the chimney, that would be great.
[28:15.35]Oh shit, I flew out.
[28:20.03]How did you do that?
[28:23.33]Are you serious?
[28:25.31]Well, there goes that.
[28:26.61]You grab it and you scroll forward.
[28:28.19]There's a gun here.
[28:28.71]There's a gun on the floor.
[28:34.21]Wait, you got a gun?
[28:35.17]Yeah, let's go.
[28:36.21]Please play the game normally, Vinny.
[28:40.53]Yeah, Vinny, we're all playing the game.
[28:42.41]Where are you?
[28:42.87]I don't know how to get out of here.
[28:48.47]Here, let me play the game normally.
[28:50.07]Vinny, what the frick?
[28:54.13]How do you get out of this place?
[28:57.71]Did it get thinner?
[29:07.95]I'll shoot.
[29:09.73]I'll shoot.
[29:10.22]You try and put poopies on me.
[29:12.74]I'll shoot.
[29:14.36]We were at poopies over on the strip.
[29:18.38]Alright, let's take it seriously this time.
[29:21.38]I'm stuck in the crawl space.
[29:24.20]Just shoot me.
[29:24.72]I'm going to put my face through here and shoot me.
[29:27.53]Oh, shit.
[29:28.91]Oh, you can't eat it.
[29:30.25]Why'd you tell me to eat it?
[29:35.20]Can you come over and shoot me in the face, please?
[29:37.46]I might be in trouble.
[29:42.57]I'm not kidding.
[29:44.09]Where are you guys?
[29:45.21]Can you guys toss me something in the broom?
[29:47.25]In the well?
[29:48.85]In the well.
[29:53.27]Just press caps lock.
[29:56.65]I think that'll solve the problem.
[29:59.45]Yeah.
[30:02.88]I can't get out.
[30:06.97]Don't jump.
[30:10.35]How do you get out?
[30:11.83]Press caps and press space.
[30:15.07]I don't have that.
[30:15.97]Bro, you don't have the developer mode?
[30:19.78]Oh, fine.
[30:20.12]I'll dev.
[30:23.44]Somebody please kill me.
[30:24.38]Please.
[30:28.76]I thought we turned dev mode off.
[30:31.45]I died.
[30:32.71]Why are we begging for death?
[30:39.84]We're supposed to take this one seriously.
[30:45.95]This is serious.
[30:47.03]Anyway, I'm in the chimney with you.
[30:48.67]What's up?
[30:49.45]Oh, man.
[30:50.05]Are you still in the chimney?
[30:52.77]It's very serious right now, yeah.
[30:55.36]Okay.
[30:58.86]No, how did you get up?
[30:59.98]I can't.
[31:00.92]You have to, like, scroll wheel differently.
[31:02.88]Yeah, I am.
[31:03.78]You gotta get the perfect height while you jump at it.
[31:06.72]Just spam jump and scroll.
[31:09.56]Yeah.
[31:11.36]Stop giving everyone poop!
[31:16.46]Yeah, there you go.
[31:18.26]Oh, lord.
[31:19.21]Go on, dude.
[31:24.19]This is fucking gross.
[31:31.67]Vinny.
[31:32.75]Yo.
[31:33.43]Turn around.
[31:34.55]Oh my god.
[31:36.21]Geodude.

[31:45.14]Does somebody want to drive this time and not crash us and make us- Apparently the host is the best one to drive, but someone said because of the lag.
[31:54.11]I'll drive.
[31:54.53]Yeah, driving is fun.
[31:57.03]We should definitely take turns.
[32:00.91]I think the host has the best driving experience because of the lag.
[32:07.73]I'm going to get in there.
[32:08.47]Yeah, then Jerma, it's up to you.
[32:10.89]No, I got this for a little bit.
[32:12.53]Let me try.
[32:13.65]Yeah, it's only Vegas to New York City.
[32:16.23]It's just going to jitter.
[32:18.89]If it sucks over there, I'll take over.

[34:12.06]Backing up some really nice noise.
[34:14.32]Oh!

[34:35.93]I don't know how to- Oh, he got- he got launched into the field.
[34:38.97]I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[34:41.64]Uh, I got- I think I got shot in the head.
[34:47.06]Hey, you know what doesn't help, uh, the lag between us?
[34:50.46]Opening and closing the door a hundred times.
[34:52.58]I'm trying to take it off!
[34:54.14]I'm trying to take it off so there's less things!
[34:57.00]I got it!
[34:57.70]Okay, you want the doors gone?
[34:58.84]I get the doors.
[35:01.07]Yes!
[35:01.59]How is the chair broken?
[35:04.03]Why are you backing up?
[35:06.34]I don't know, it's doing it on its own.
[35:08.62]I'm in the middle.
[35:11.24]Alright, we're off.
[35:15.72]Oh man, what a great view.
[35:16.88]Alright, here we go.
[35:17.96]Okay, let's do this.
[35:21.02]Why is it instantly now nighttime?
[35:22.76]Okay, everybody go to bed.
[35:23.96]Everybody go to bed.
[35:24.64]How do you turn on the lights?
[35:31.80]Guys, we're out of gas.
[35:34.17]Are we really?
[35:37.64]Is there any gas in the house?
[35:40.80]We don't even leave the front yard.
[35:45.29]But the car's still drifting away.
[35:48.77]Vinny, how did you use all the gas?
[35:51.55]I don't know.
[35:53.75]Oh, God, dude.
[35:54.57]I got gas.

[36:17.49]I'm stuck, hold on.
[36:19.85]I'll do it.
[36:20.77]Alright, somebody has to get in there and put the handbrake on.
[36:23.44]Alright, I'm filling up.
[36:27.80]Can't someone go to bed?
[36:33.54]That's the back of the car.
[36:35.10]It's the back of the car?
[36:36.92]You look like Minecraft Steve.
[36:41.55]We need oil, too, I'm being told.
[36:43.29]Did we double sleep?
[36:51.66]Oh, somebody slept, right?
[36:53.08]Yeah, I did.
[36:54.62]I did it all.
[36:58.32]Anybody get the flashlight?
[36:59.98]Is there only one flashlight?
[37:03.39]What is that?
[37:03.83]There's a little portable light thing.
[37:04.93]I'm going to get it.
[37:09.59]Put this back on the back.
[37:10.83]I can see what I'm doing.

[37:31.22]You can take the fluorescent lights out and hold them up like lightsabers.
[37:35.26]Yo, should we get this barrel of diesel in case we find a truck?
[37:39.09]That'd be sick.
[37:44.63]Yeah.
[37:45.89]It's a beautiful sky though.
[37:50.85]Yeah.
[37:51.75]Wait, was I not supposed to put oil in the gas tank?
[37:56.58]Wait, what?

[38:50.10]Oh shit!
[38:51.90]I found a barrel of gas!
[38:53.88]Hell yeah.
[38:54.24]40 liters!
[38:56.56]Wait, we should empty out the other gas and put this in it.
[39:02.08]Alright, so what we're gonna do is... Vinny, open up the gas thing.
[39:07.96]Yeah.
[39:08.64]And Ster.
[39:09.28]Tilt the car and let's get that gas out.

[39:18.55]Wait, what do you need me to do?
[39:20.03]Like this?
[39:21.75]Yeah.

[39:28.71]Just do a nice tilt.
[39:30.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:31.88]Keep like that.
[39:32.30]Keep.
[39:35.44]Yeah, almost out.
[39:37.64]Perfect.
[39:38.50]We good?
[39:39.52]Yep.
[39:40.52]Okay.
[39:44.67]I'm returning.
[39:45.69]I'm just grabbing the TV.
[39:49.89]Alright, save some gay ass.
[39:51.25]I feel like smoking a cigarette is the worst thing to do right now.
[39:55.19]Does anyone know where the trunk is so the barrels don't fly out?
[39:59.02]It was over here somewhere.
[39:59.86]I mean, it shouldn't fly out, right?
[40:02.52]It has that lock on it.
[40:03.44]Everything is so bright.
[40:04.28]I wanted to attach the TV, but it's not letting me.
[40:09.62]Alright, let's get this thing sealed up.
[40:15.45]Alright, it's almost daytime.
[40:17.05]We should fix the seat.
[40:19.29]There we go.
[40:20.91]I liked it where it was.
[40:22.57]Yeah, me too.
[40:24.11]Why did you do that?
[40:25.39]Because I want to be able to drive 15 feet without us desyncing and the car exploding.
[40:29.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[40:30.32]Can we put the seat on the roof?
[40:32.50]That'd be actually pretty awesome, can't we?
[40:34.60]We'll attach.
[40:39.44]We'll attach.
[40:40.78]It's not stuck up there.
[40:42.02]Let's try.
[40:42.34]I'm going to try driving.
[40:43.62]Let's see.
[40:43.92]I think it's moving separately.
[40:44.98]It's going to fall off.
[40:48.14]No.
[40:48.20]It's nice while it lasts.
[40:51.98]The car's not driving.
[40:54.34]Wait, what?
[40:56.08]There might be... Wait, there you go.
[41:00.14]Wait, because... Hold on, hold on.
[41:02.25]Is it too much oil in the gas tank?
[41:06.63]Wait.
[41:07.88]Or maybe the battery?
[41:09.00]I think we're out of- we're out- we need- Where's the- It's the battery.
[41:14.92]We need a new- we need a new battery, guys.
[41:19.38]Why do I leave?
[41:20.06]Okay.
[41:20.76]We have so much gas here.
[41:21.78]I'm gonna look.
[41:23.84]Oil on the gas tank?
[41:25.10]Put oil in the engine.
[41:27.22]No.
[41:28.35]We need to just clean the battery.
[41:31.53]Oh, I'm drinking it.
[41:32.27]I don't wanna do that.
[41:34.43]Does this thing have no oil?
[41:36.47]I got oil right here.
[41:38.05]Yeah, I put a lot of oil in there.
[41:40.63]In this thing?
[41:43.61]Where's the hole?
[41:45.51]In the gas tank, I put a bunch of oil.
[41:49.10]Anyway, that's not why the car isn't working.
[41:51.16]It's because we need a battery.
[41:55.60]No, no, no.
[41:56.74]It doesn't need batteries.
[41:59.28]How do you put the cigarette down?
[42:00.62]I don't know.
[42:02.84]I camera locked myself again.
[42:04.25]I don't know what I'm pressing.
[42:05.81]Wait, maybe we're supposed to put gas in the...
[42:09.46]We were supposed to mix oil in the fuel tank.
[42:12.14]Somebody just said, how many streamers does it take to fucking work a car?
[42:16.20]Alright, how much should I put in?
[42:17.88]Put some oil in there.
[42:20.26]I think this is empty.
[42:22.93]Oh wait, I got it right here.
[42:24.99]That's diesel.
[42:28.77]Guys, I cannot look left or right.
[42:30.71]What do I do?
[42:32.32]Wait, what do you mean?
[42:33.38]I cannot look left or right.
[42:36.40]I'm locked in.
[42:37.60]You were playing the game as intended, I believe.
[42:40.64]This happened last one, too.
[42:41.84]Alright, I got some oil.
[42:44.48]And I can't... Maybe just rejoin?
[42:47.21]I feel like I'm... You want to try it again?
[42:49.17]Alt?
[42:50.51]Q. Q. Okay.
[42:52.71]Alright, moment of truth.

[42:59.11]How much percentage oil should I put?
[43:05.18]That would be crazy.

[47:12.98]I know.
[47:13.38]I know.
[47:13.68]We got this.
[47:14.16]We got this.
[47:14.48]It was none of us.
[47:16.94]Alright.
[47:17.24]Cool.
[47:17.60]Cool.
[47:18.12]Check the tank or it might be full of gas.
[47:20.34]Does anybody want a bite of this?
[47:23.23]A bite?
[47:24.13]Yeah.
[47:24.51]I'm going to tilt the car and get the oil out again.
[47:26.89]Thanks.
[47:27.37]I'll take it.
[47:28.67]Why did that thing just... Why is that flying in the air?
[47:31.89]What the fuck?
[47:33.32]I um do we need that I tried to I tried to investigate it for gas and it started flying is that normal Ster you think I'm dying your character oh no I can't I cannot I can't right now Vinny are you alright I don't think I'm I don't think I'm going to be okay Jerma what happened uh are we able to drink the the oil
[48:02.12]Because I'm very thirsty.
[48:03.74]I think you can, but it hurts.
[48:09.62]It hurts pretty bad.
[48:10.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[48:15.50]What's wrong?
[48:16.24]Oh, oh, I thought.
[48:16.90]Okay, that's intentional.
[48:17.92]Alright.
[48:21.52]Oh, no, the seat fell off.
[48:23.32]Oh, sick.
[48:23.86]Oops.
[48:27.75]Yeah, I need to empty it because our new, I'm pretty sure our new gas tank, whatever, or engine, we could put oil in it.
[48:35.37]Ah, cool.
[48:37.93]I think it's empty now.
[48:39.72]Alright, we're good.
[48:46.44]Where, Ster, where are you?
[48:49.06]There's like a croissant over here.
[48:52.30]I was trying to eat that.
[48:54.22]Here, y'all, drop it.
[48:56.09]Eat the floor, Cressart.
[48:56.85]Let's help you.
[48:57.45]I feel like I'm just a spider monster.
[49:03.79]We love this precious.
[49:05.91]We want it.
[49:08.35]I don't know if we need this, but it looked like a kind of important item.
[49:14.68]Do we need any more gas?
[49:15.96]Are we good on oil and gas?
[49:18.38]We're good for now.
[49:19.22]Okay.
[49:23.45]Spare tire.
[49:24.15]We should take a spare tire.
[49:25.37]I think there's a new water cooler in there, right?
[49:30.27]I'm going to put the tire in the trunk here.
[49:32.05]I don't know how cars work.
[49:33.49]I'm not prepared for this.
[49:35.78]Well, since we're sitting in the back, yeah.
[49:37.32]Do you want me to drive still?
[49:41.40]Yeah.
[49:41.96]I think, yeah.
[49:42.48]I think it's been alright.
[49:44.76]Well, let's get this new cooler.
[49:46.52]Oh, yeah.
[49:50.07]We have no gas.
[49:51.99]Wait, there's no cooler in there, that's why.
[49:53.23]Oops.
[49:58.51]Do we have any water?
[49:59.35]We need water.
[50:08.26]I'm gonna get ya!
[50:09.50]I'm gonna get ya!
[50:11.52]Guys, press P. Yeah.
[50:24.55]Didn't we completely fill?
[50:25.83]Yeah, we got gas.
[50:27.63]100% gas.
[50:28.03]It says empty.
[50:30.41]What?
[50:32.27]It says empty.
[50:33.41]Let me get a look.
[50:37.86]Did you drink gas?
[50:39.00]No, I didn't drink the gas.
[50:40.42]I drank some.
[50:42.80]Was the gas cap left open?
[50:45.06]That might be some part of the reason.
[50:46.61]No, it still says 100% on the gas.
[50:48.11]Oh, okay.
[50:48.65]Am I reading it wrong?
[50:49.35]It didn't work, but
[50:53.04]Pee in the radiator.
[50:54.04]Guys, we all have to piss in the radiator.
[50:55.58]Piss in the gas tank, it'll work.
[50:58.89]Piss in the radiator?
[51:00.39]Okay, no, I'll hold it.
[51:01.05]Come on.
[51:01.27]I'm gonna open this.
[51:04.59]Alright, can you aim your... If I aim, you hold it for me?
[51:12.77]Alright, you gotta pee in here.
[51:15.35]Who's peeing?
[51:16.31]I don't have any pee.
[51:17.43]I've only drank like fucking one cup of water today.
[51:19.41]I'll go drink some shit.
[51:20.35]I'll be right back.
[51:22.17]Okay, hold this.
[51:22.51]I'm not pissing it.
[51:25.18]Wait, maybe I can piss in it.
[51:26.32]Let's see.
[51:26.74]Can you pee in it?
[51:27.20]I don't know if it's going in.
[51:31.72]Can you hold it for me?
[51:32.96]Yeah, I'll hold it for you.
[51:34.18]What do you want?
[51:37.06]Oh, sorry.
[51:37.59]They hit you.
[51:38.37]Oh, the way?
[51:38.71]Or was it upside down?
[51:39.57]No, that's upside down.
[51:42.93]How about that, right there?
[51:52.23]Alcohol, water, diesel, oil.
[51:54.06]That's my piss.
[51:55.24]Oh, it actually worked?
[51:57.46]Yeah.
[51:58.12]Holy shit.
[51:59.00]Wow.
[52:00.18]Okay, so let's put this back.
[52:05.97]Is my previous rotting corpse merged with the vehicle?
[52:08.75]Yeah, I see it.
[52:09.81]Alright, cool.
[52:10.83]Alright, good, good, good.
[52:11.63]No, pal!
[52:12.17]I just drank your fucking piss!
[52:13.39]I didn't drink at all, right?
[52:16.89]Dude!
[52:18.59]I filled it back up, don't worry.
[52:19.49]I can't get this hood clean.
[52:26.28]Alright, can we get Vinny's body out of here so we can put this in?
[52:31.10]I got that.
[52:31.64]I got that.
[52:32.20]Hang on.
[52:32.86]Let me see if I can get rid of this.
[52:34.02]Wait, I'm pretty sure you guys can break these boxes.
[52:36.84]I seem to be... My corpse is stuck in there.
[52:40.48]Let me see if I can get it in here.
[52:45.44]I'm gonna use my superpower.
[52:47.23]Alright, that shit's in.
[52:51.13]We have liftoff here?
[52:53.37]Yeah, it looks like... You need metal brush or yellow bottle for rust.
[52:57.83]Okay, never mind then.
[52:59.52]Why is it still saying this is fucking empty?
[53:02.32]Did the vehicle change colors?
[53:05.06]Milk tanker?
[53:05.78]What do you mean milk tanker?
[53:11.34]It's the battery now?
[53:12.40]So wait, what is wrong with the car?
[53:14.20]I think the battery's dead.
[53:17.05]There's no battery.
[53:18.11]Oh, there's milk in here!
[53:20.59]Guys, get some milk!
[53:22.19]There's no batteries in the car.
[53:23.05]Get the fucking thing out of the way.
[53:28.40]Okay, that has oil.
[53:29.44]That is modern art.
[53:32.08]That has water in it.
[53:36.36]This has gas.
[53:36.96]Oh, we need oil in the gas tank.
[53:39.16]Still?
[53:39.46]Maybe it's this specific car.
[53:41.20]Are you guys not seeing this Gumby?
[53:44.76]What is that?
[53:45.26]Oh, I see it.
[53:46.72]That was me.
[53:47.67]That was my rotten corpse.
[53:50.71]Fucking flying around.
[53:52.71]Watch this.
[53:53.13]Watch this.
[53:53.53]Should we try diesel?
[53:54.95]There's milk in here.
[53:55.87]Guys.
[53:57.49]This engine's too small for diesel.
[54:00.93]There's no way.
[54:02.05]You only have 3% gas?
[54:04.47]It just works.
[54:05.99]Hold on a second.
[54:07.17]You see that mountain over there?
[54:09.81]You can climb it.
[54:12.99]I'll prove it.
[54:13.83]Oh, shit.
[54:15.98]Oh.
[54:16.72]Oh, no.
[54:21.00]Okay.
[54:21.66]We need- I- I may have done a problem.
[54:23.34]Okay, it's a hundred- You put diesel in there?
[54:25.50]Let's try it.
[54:26.34]So it's a hundred percent gas, but it's only three liters in the tank.
[54:30.95]It's not a hundred percent full.
[54:32.51]It's- Oh.
[54:33.23]And then I poured this in and I fucked it up.
[54:35.89]Oh, it doesn't need to be full though, but... I'm gonna empty it.
[54:42.53]Vinny, the milk shut off the milk.
[54:44.93]um oh my god what's happening your milk real quick wait what guys this body is attached to the car they don't want their milk this is gonna us over oh my god yeah this is really bad we gotta get this out of here I'll bring them the milk I'll I'll take the I'll get rid of the body that's Jerma out of context that's amazing
[55:15.95]alright okay dude the body is attached to it what oh I thought the car went into the sky what the is he doing yeah I think I think let's try let's try diesel
[55:44.50]Am I muted?
[55:45.28]No, I don't think I'm muted.
[55:46.78]Yo.
[55:48.34]Yo.
[55:49.44]I just don't think they want milk.
[55:51.00]They're dealing with more important issues.
[55:53.40]And I'm like, hey guys, drink this milk.
[55:56.27]Give us the milk.
[55:57.25]How do we unattach your body to the cart?
[56:00.25]It's gone now.
[56:01.49]Don't worry about the milk.
[56:05.61]Did you drink it all?
[56:07.69]I drank some of it.
[56:09.22]The corpse is now a Tesseract.
[56:12.20]It's like a fourth dimensional being.
[56:14.18]oh boy it is we gotta get away from this area I see it yeah this isn't good do we have uh any diesel I think I don't understand why the car doesn't work and all we did was drive a minute down the road we didn't I switched the engine let's just switch the engine again and save this old one I guess I just got pancaked by the car I think
[56:44.04]I missed my milk truck.
[56:46.56]I'm getting the old engine.
[56:49.44]What the hell is going on?
[56:57.39]Where's the old... I'm gonna sleep, so we get daytime again.
[57:04.69]Mhm.
[57:07.00]Okay.
[57:15.72]There we go.
[57:16.92]My chat is saying that this all happened as a result of me driving.
[57:19.62]I don't know if I agree with that chat member.
[57:24.50]I think this was a team effort.
[57:25.71]I think me attaching my old rotten corpse to the vehicle probably didn't help, though.
[57:34.01]I think I got captured.
[57:36.11]I'm not sure.
[57:36.63]Alright, you want to reset it again?
[57:40.80]And for real this time, we go for it?
[57:45.35]Wait, there's a chance I might have gotten it.
[57:47.45]Different engines need different radiators and different fuel.
[57:50.77]Wait, this was diesel?
[57:52.09]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[58:02.48]I also may be on the complete other side of the map.
[58:05.22]It flung me, I died, and I respawned.
[58:08.12]And I am nowhere near any of you.
[58:12.93]A new server might not be the worst idea.
[58:15.37]I mean, we know how to play now.
[58:16.83]We know how to play.
[58:18.09]Yeah, let's restart.
[58:18.91]One more time.
[58:19.63]One more time.
[58:20.51]One more truth.
[58:21.13]Hold on.
[58:22.50]I gotta see if this works.
[58:26.50]Car works.
[58:28.22]Okay, apparently the small two stroke engines need 2-5% oil and 95-98% gas.
[58:36.79]We actually have to restart.
[58:39.27]That body is attached to the car.
[58:41.71]Alright, let's just restart.
[58:46.89]That's why the car's not working.
[58:48.07]That body is attached to it.
[58:51.70]Oh, man.
[58:52.18]Do you see it?
[58:55.14]Yes.
[58:56.26]I saw it a minute ago.
[58:57.16]Now I don't.
[58:58.52]Alright.
[58:59.42]Redoing the seed.
[59:00.82]Random seed again.
[59:01.64]Okay.
[59:03.22]Starting... I'll let you know when the server is up.
[59:06.29]Okay.
[59:06.55]If we see a dead... We cannot die near the car.
[59:10.70]That's a new rule.
[59:11.60]Do not die near the car or kill monsters near the car.
[59:14.39]Alright, same deal.
[59:15.93]It's up.
[59:17.07]Same password, same name is there.
[59:20.49]What I see right now is insane.
[59:24.63]I'm struggling.
[59:27.05]Okay, we're good.
[59:27.67]It's up.
[59:31.61]Okay.
[59:34.27]Just keep me far away from the car and we'll be fine.
[59:41.74]Yeah, Vinny, when you walked over and were holding yourself and put yourself into the front of the car.
[59:46.56]Ooh, we got a truck this time.
[59:49.79]Ooh, wait.
[59:51.35]Where can we sit, though?
[59:53.63]Uh-oh.
[59:55.39]I mean, we just hop in the back, no?
[59:57.71]I don't know.
[59:59.85]I think we'll fly out.
[60:00.71]Maybe if we sit, we can... Maybe we just gotta double up.
[60:07.19]We just double everybody up.
[60:08.90]find extra seats what if we double everyone up what's that mean two per seat otherwise Ster uh when you about the end of that I just walked I watched you just kind of like walk around out in the wilderness you were just walking around looking at stuff yeah it was very funny I liked it
[60:31.46]okay well we're on a road trip I think do you see the distance do you see like the the the road is going into the sky oh that we got the coolest seat ever then alright that's gonna be awesome how do I uh oh load the gun with bullets whoa what the yeah this is gonna be an adventure for sure okay this is going to be another game over in one minute
[60:53.44]No, dude.
[60:53.60]I don't think the car's gonna have enough power to go up.
[60:55.24]Oh, I just hit my mic.
[60:56.52]Oh, we got water.
[60:57.34]We got... Who shot me?
[60:58.66]I got a sneeze.
[60:59.86]Um, that was an accident.
[61:04.44]How dead are you?
[61:06.05]A little bit.
[61:06.47]Where did it go?
[61:07.11]Okay, I won't do it again.
[61:08.83]Sorry.
[61:09.83]It's okay.
[61:12.07]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[61:13.71]It's just... I didn't know this existed.
[61:18.58]This is fun.
[61:19.14]Me too.
[61:19.42]This is wonderful.
[61:23.25]It's dirty.
[61:24.35]Oh, who's under it?
[61:24.89]Is it you, Vinny?
[61:26.31]I wonder if the lag is making it better.
[61:28.18]I don't know how this happened.
[61:29.78]I'm trying to get out of this.
[61:31.22]Alright, we need to lift him up.
[61:34.82]I'm good, I'm good.
[61:40.62]I say we attach everything we can find to the car.
[61:45.12]Yeah, by the way, the fly spotter does not do any damage.
[61:47.91]The thing's a piece of shit.
[61:48.83]It does nothing.
[61:50.50]Guys, I don't think we can go up that road.
[61:53.74]It kind of just looks like it ends.
[61:56.96]Well, we'll only know when we get there.
[61:58.50]I can see your nose hairs.
[62:06.59]Is there that much detail in the game?
[62:08.73]I'm afraid of this thing.
[62:21.04]shoot boxes for loot oh this is a diesel car I feel like the I'm making a film yeah I feel like we're gonna have a problem with the two-seater the graphics here are so good I think as long as we take it slow we should be able to kind of sit in the back
[62:48.02]Until we find seats, yeah.
[62:49.88]Okay.
[62:51.04]And we are going to take it slow, by the way.
[62:53.06]We're going to do very... Help backing up, help turning, not go 100 miles per hour.
[62:57.89]Oh, God.
[63:01.55]Oh, no.
[63:02.21]Oh, no.
[63:02.95]All I do is try to get in the car.
[63:04.35]The gas is dumping.
[63:05.05]It was moving.
[63:05.69]Gas is dumping.
[63:07.15]Where?
[63:07.41]Gas is dumping.
[63:08.01]Guys, how did this happen?
[63:11.53]I know how.
[63:12.19]I don't know.
[63:12.57]It's by this little guy right here.
[63:14.13]It was me.
[63:14.61]It was me.
[63:15.05]It was me.
[63:15.43]If you pick up an item...
[63:17.39]And you turn off collision, and you put it in the car, it will just... Don't do that.
[63:22.77]Okay, I won't.
[63:24.13]Just Nick Gary's mod.
[63:25.83]I jumped into the car, like, to the back of the truck, and it, like, fucked up.
[63:30.48]So are we gonna even be able to drive, like, with people in the back of it?
[63:34.62]Vinny, I cannot take anything you're doing seriously the way that you look right now.
[63:41.76]There you go, alright, nice.
[63:43.01]It's driving, it's nice, it's nice.
[63:45.41]Okay, we need more seats.
[63:48.84]Wait, wait, haven't I had a crazy idea?
[63:51.54]Come here.
[63:55.32]Come with me.
[63:56.36]This side.
[63:57.22]We're gonna press C at the same time, imagine.
[63:59.40]Press C at the same time?
[64:00.88]The C, the C. Ready?
[64:02.44]Three, two, on go, okay?
[64:04.96]Yep.
[64:05.22]Three, two, one, go.
[64:08.58]Bingo.
[64:10.30]We're good.
[64:12.98]Wait.
[64:13.48]We just need Ster.
[64:16.26]I can see inside of you.
[64:17.30]No, Finny, wait, hold on.
[64:18.32]Wait for Ster.
[64:19.14]Wait for Ster.
[64:19.66]I'm watching you guys do kickflips in this car.
[64:21.80]Alright, get in.
[64:22.95]Okay, three of us should get in the left seat then.
[64:24.49]But we need more stuff though, no?
[64:26.95]Are we ready to leave?
[64:28.25]Yeah.
[64:34.05]We don't need anything else.
[64:35.51]What could we possibly need?
[64:37.21]Does anyone else want to drive?
[64:39.05]I should probably abdicate my driving right now, actually.
[64:41.68]I've had my chance.
[64:42.52]I'm good.
[64:43.56]I'm good.
[64:44.18]I think it's actually perfect.
[64:46.02]I think it's the perfect amount of jank that we need.
[64:48.32]Alright.
[64:52.07]We need this.
[65:02.07]Uh, apparently, can you save as the host?
[65:05.59]Can I?
[65:05.95]Uh, I think I can.
[65:09.19]Well, let me make sure it doesn't, like, leak the lobby.
[65:12.07]Yeah, I do think that the recommendation was save often in multiplayer in case our car spirals into hell.
[65:18.20]Uh, I guess I just did?
[65:19.38]Yeah, I see one.
[65:24.18]Okay.
[65:26.18]We have a save point right here.
[65:35.96]Hey, can you come here, uh, Ster?
[65:38.14]It's me.
[65:38.58]Hey, how's it going?
[65:41.64]Can you stand on this poop right here?
[65:43.96]Oh, man, this is such a cool car.
[65:45.66]And then get trapped!
[65:47.66]Ah, no!
[65:48.74]I fell for the poop trap.
[65:50.58]Excuse me, sir, sir, excuse me.
[65:51.96]What kind of car is this?
[65:53.08]This is a beauty.
[65:55.21]This thing is beautiful.
[65:56.41]Whoa, that green color.
[65:58.41]You like it?
[66:00.13]Yeah.
[66:02.19]Oh, my God!
[66:06.14]It's alright.
[66:06.88]It's alright.
[66:07.26]We're good.
[66:07.60]Everything's fine.
[66:09.90]How do we not own a chair?
[66:11.52]I didn't know you could do that.
[66:23.75]That's fucking disgusting.
[66:25.09]I cannot believe you can do that.
[66:27.91]Wait, we can through that door.
[66:28.85]Oh, I got the katana.
[66:31.77]I got the katana.
[66:36.24]I need to sit down after that.
[66:38.81]Alright, are we all in?
[66:43.61]One more diesel coming.
[66:44.45]How do you attach things?
[66:47.33]Can we get water?
[66:51.53]Does the coolant have water in it?
[66:53.46]The attach doesn't seem to work on every surface.
[66:55.88]Also, Vinny, maybe I should drive because if we have three people in the same seat, it actually might be insane.
[67:02.54]Yeah, I'm going to get out.
[67:03.74]I don't want to do this.
[67:05.53]Uh, how do I get out?
[67:10.76]You gotta, like, aim at a very specific angle.
[67:12.62]Okay.
[67:14.56]Vinny, you also, you look like you're, you kind of look like a Doug character.
[67:19.46]Hey, dude!
[67:20.60]Honk honk!
[67:25.27]Oh, that's right.
[67:25.75]We had Dinksonas, right?
[67:27.09]When we were streaming?
[67:28.41]Not too long ago?
[67:29.15]That's right.
[67:30.85]That was six years ago.
[67:32.13]Oh my god.
[67:35.79]It might have been two, but yes.
[67:37.05]Or Dougsonas.
[67:38.39]Was that with Poke or was that with... It was not with Poke.
[67:40.83]Do not talk about it in front of them.
[67:42.16]I don't know what a Dougsona is.
[67:44.36]Ah, shit.
[67:46.48]Was I supposed to know?
[67:47.06]Was I supposed to find out?
[67:49.16]No, it's cool, man.
[67:49.98]No, it's nothing.
[67:50.84]I'll tell you in the other chat.
[67:51.76]Oh, okay.
[67:52.54]You guys, the seat right here.
[67:54.90]Ready?
[67:55.16]Three.
[67:56.68]Yeah, you all can do it at the same time.
[67:58.44]Yeah.
[67:58.80]Jeremy, you count down.
[68:00.20]okay when I say you hear go the g and go press e on the seat ready yeah three two one go beautiful okay now see their mouths yeah that's disgusting oh it's so weird are we good yeah okay we should be ready
[68:24.40]I'm gonna go very slow.
[68:26.38]Don't put your hands in my face.
[68:27.92]If you want to restart the server again, then go ahead and do it.
[68:31.75]Alright, we're good.
[68:34.61]We're good.
[68:36.03]We're going on the rollercoaster.
[68:37.55]Okay, do we want to go on the rollercoaster or do we want to go somewhere else?
[68:41.73]I haven't been... Oh my god, what the fuck?
[68:44.76]Are we under attack?
[68:47.70]Is the car powerful enough?
[68:49.50]Let's see.
[68:51.86]I don't see an end to the road.
[68:53.48]There's like tapers off.
[68:56.28]I'm holding W. I'm actually gonna drive as good as I can here.
[69:07.06]This is awful.
[69:15.27]Oh, it's not just a road in the sky.
[69:17.19]Who hit space?
[69:19.11]I didn't.
[69:21.43]I didn't.
[69:21.79]It's just not powerful enough.
[69:24.35]Hold on.
[69:24.93]There's a big rock behind us.
[69:26.15]I got to get this right.
[69:27.03]Hold on a second.
[69:28.97]Should I go behind?
[69:29.52]Should I push us?
[69:30.90]You might.
[69:31.18]Yeah.
[69:31.72]Maybe get out and push because I got the brake on and we're going to roll back into that rock.
[69:37.00]I can't get out.
[69:37.54]How could this have happened?
[69:42.32]Okay.
[69:43.16]Somebody guide me for where the rock is because I cannot see.
[69:46.17]Take off the brake.
[69:47.93]Why are we floating?
[69:48.47]Oh my god.
[69:49.17]Oh no.
[69:50.39]Oh no, why?
[69:51.25]I had nothing to do with this this time.
[69:52.99]Why is there liquids falling out?
[69:55.25]We're good.
[69:56.69]I have it completely under control.
[70:00.97]What was le- something was leaking.
[70:02.39]I think it was maybe because of the gas?
[70:05.17]I, uh, that wasn't me.
[70:06.41]Are we all out of episode?
[70:07.41]I left the tank open.
[70:08.07]It was me.
[70:09.15]Okay, well, let's- I just died behind you guys.
[70:12.49]Oh no.
[70:13.89]We left Pokey's dead!
[70:15.11]What happened?
[70:19.26]We're going way too fast, by the way.
[70:22.74]Poke, where are you?
[70:23.26]Did you spawn?
[70:23.60]We're just going back home!
[70:24.74]I see you guys driving home.
[70:25.94]I see you guys up here.
[70:26.70]I'm going way too fast!
[70:30.49]I actually can't slow down, otherwise I'll break.
[70:33.09]We're okay.
[70:34.27]Okay.
[70:35.23]We're fine.
[70:37.70]I'm coming down.
[70:39.26]I'm up the hill.
[70:39.76]Okay, I'm looking for you.
[70:46.06]I'm just trying not to go so fast, because that's how you get the whole thing to flip over.
[70:49.72]I don't think we can go up.
[70:53.41]Yeah, we have to go the other way.
[70:54.25]Alright, I see you, Pug.
[70:57.73]There you are.
[71:03.20]Car's on fire or some shit.
[71:04.86]We're on fire?
[71:06.26]It's, like, really smoky.
[71:08.49]Aren't we?
[71:09.91]Yeah, I'm noticing some, like, bubbles.
[71:11.49]Oh, fuck, this thing is on fire.
[71:17.97]Okay.
[71:18.91]We're good.
[71:23.34]You guys all have to get out for me.
[71:25.36]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[71:26.24]I'm out.
[71:36.30]I removed Poke's body successfully.
[71:38.18]Ready?
[71:40.38]On go.
[71:41.04]3, 2, 1, go.
[71:43.54]No, I didn't make it.
[71:44.92]I didn't have an angle.
[71:47.31]When everybody's got an angle, let me know.
[71:48.69]I've got an angle.
[71:49.91]Ready?
[71:50.81]3, 2, 1, go.
[71:53.85]Oh, I didn't get it.
[71:54.57]Shit.
[71:55.29]Do it again.
[71:55.99]I didn't get it.
[71:59.32]I'm winning this rock, paper, scissors every time.
[72:01.38]I can't get out.
[72:04.08]I can't get out.
[72:06.28]Alright.
[72:08.80]We good?
[72:09.78]Yep.
[72:10.70]Three, two, one, go.
[72:17.09]Try one more time.
[72:17.89]Okay.
[72:19.23]Alright.
[72:23.45]Three, two, one, go.
[72:26.94]Yes.
[72:27.66]There we are.
[72:28.36]Alright, gentlemen.
[72:29.86]Let's head the other way.
[72:34.04]You guys should press C and then, uh, zoom around and zoom in and look at us together.
[72:45.97]I can't do it.
[72:46.49]I'm driving the car.
[72:47.27]It looks really funny though.
[72:50.71]Um, okay.
[72:55.75]Okay, here we go.
[72:56.71]Going way too fast.
[73:00.23]That's probably good.
[73:01.75]We'll get to somewhere eventually.
[73:03.49]We gotta get to Wally World.
[73:06.02]My camera's stuck again.
[73:07.58]Dude, why did the wheel just rip to the left?
[73:11.54]I don't know.
[73:12.72]Fix what?
[73:13.20]Your camera?
[73:15.96]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[73:17.36]Q or C?
[73:19.96]Q or C. No.
[73:22.24]No?
[73:22.76]What's broken?
[73:25.40]I can't move.
[73:26.70]What the fuck is going on?
[73:27.56]I'm not doing that.
[73:34.78]Alright, when we get to the bottom of this hill, I'm sleeping because I'm not driving at night like this.
[73:45.57]Are we going 200 miles an hour?
[73:47.41]I think we are.
[73:48.41]That's why it's so hard to drive.
[73:49.75]Wait, what does U do?
[73:54.88]Oh, U's weird.
[73:56.08]Dude, does this fucking road end?
[74:00.82]Slow down!
[74:01.60]I can't!
[74:02.68]I can't!
[74:03.28]We're going 500 miles per hour!
[74:04.80]Okay, okay.
[74:05.78]You have to drift this.
[74:06.68]You're gonna have to drift.
[74:12.38]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[74:13.62]Yeah, we're fine.
[74:16.38]Okay, I think we need to sleep now.
[74:17.74]There's just coyotes out there, but we're alright.
[74:19.76]Who's in their settings?
[74:24.82]Who blue screened?
[74:25.76]Who blue screened?
[74:32.14]Is someone good?
[74:35.12]We're missing a tire.
[74:37.06]We're missing a tire.
[74:38.00]Oh my god.
[74:40.18]That homunculus face is so... Oh god.
[74:43.37]Jerma, go to bed.
[74:44.07]Dude, I'm sorry.
[74:45.49]I can't.
[74:46.17]It won't let me.
[74:48.07]Oh, my fucking stomach hurts, dude.
[74:49.59]I couldn't go.
[74:50.61]We were going 500 miles per hour.
[74:51.73]Can you put the brakes on?
[74:53.07]We gotta change the tire.
[74:55.83]The car is not gonna stop moving.
[74:59.23]I'm not even touching anything on my controls.
[75:01.41]My guy's just freaking... I can't even... I can't even move my mouse.
[75:04.65]I'm just stuck.
[75:06.31]Can you guys all get out?
[75:07.47]What the fuck is this thing in the corner?
[75:10.61]Can anybody get out of the car?
[75:11.75]I've fallen asleep, so it should be daytime.
[75:15.52]Hold on.
[75:16.87]no it has to be Jerma I tried to go I got it oh my god okay all the wheels fell off we have to go get them all of them we have wheels in the back okay now it's daytime I don't know how to like change a wheel though there's got it's got to be easy right I don't know the car's running away I can't do anything
[75:41.74]I'll push it in the opposite direction.
[75:44.24]It's fucking blood all over the tracks.
[75:48.28]I smashed my fucking face on this thing, dude.
[75:52.32]Oh, God.
[75:54.51]Might just reload.
[75:56.49]I'm gonna leave and rejoin real quick.
[75:58.11]Hold on.
[75:58.79]You want me to just reload from the save before we left?
[76:00.99]Reload from the save.
[76:01.83]No, never mind.
[76:02.39]My mouse just died, actually.
[76:03.89]Oh, my God, dude.
[76:04.87]The blue screen thing just fucking killed me.
[76:08.01]It was my mouse.
[76:08.57]What happened?
[76:08.99]How did you?
[76:09.47]I didn't see that.
[76:10.15]What was it?
[76:10.65]It was a blue screen?
[76:13.53]It was just, I don't even know what happened.
[76:14.95]My mouse was just dead the whole time.
[76:21.76]Oh, you guys, three of you guys.
[76:23.06]How did none of you get hurt, but I did?
[76:27.52]Look at the wheel.
[76:29.46]Look where we came from.
[76:30.69]Look at the road.
[76:32.86]Is that where we came from?
[76:33.84]Yeah, look at how fucked up that is.
[76:36.66]We have to find the tires.
[76:39.82]How am I supposed to drive over that?
[76:41.92]We really were on a roller coaster.
[76:44.92]The rock you hit is up there?
[76:46.76]I think, yeah.
[76:47.88]Yeah, so the tires must be there.
[76:49.26]No, no, no, no.
[76:49.94]It's this one down here.
[76:50.80]Oh, it's here then.
[76:56.35]I see a tire jumping through the ground.
[76:58.21]Yeah.
[76:59.16]Dude, this is like the fucking coolant.
[77:00.90]I don't know.
[77:01.50]We should probably just reload when the truck existed.
[77:06.04]The tire is gone.
[77:07.30]Oh, man.
[77:08.50]That tire is gone.
[77:09.93]Damn, I grabbed the hubcap off it.
[77:11.93]We had another tire, but we're missing the main... I got a side mirror.
[77:16.39]...wheel part.
[77:19.11]Man.
[77:21.35]What do you guys think?
[77:21.85]Should we just reload?
[77:23.15]Yeah, one more time?
[77:24.34]Let's reload.
[77:25.44]It was a bad seed.
[77:26.16]We have the two-seater.
[77:27.02]Come on.
[77:27.46]It was fucked.
[77:28.28]Hey, we got the truck is actually should be fine.
[77:31.21]Should we reset the whole thing or should we start from the safe point?
[77:34.57]I say new seed.
[77:35.47]New seed?
[77:35.81]Okay.
[77:36.59]What do you guys say?
[77:38.57]We should just reload the save.
[77:40.34]Because we're going to spend 20 minutes getting the car stocked.
[77:42.62]Yeah, but we can do it in like four seconds now.
[77:44.50]Just get the gas, get the oil, boom.
[77:46.60]I'll be honest, I'm having fun.
[77:49.18]I don't care what we do.
[77:50.72]I like the new seed, dude.
[77:51.86]I like getting a new seed.
[77:52.98]Let's do a new seed.
[77:54.04]Oh my god, man.
[78:01.24]So fucking funny.
[78:02.02]Wait, what is he doing?
[78:03.02]Look at the screen.

[78:28.51]Okay, so new seed.
[78:30.03]Oh, I'm gonna shit myself.
[78:32.17]Random seed again.
[78:34.47]Loading the game.
[78:36.73]Wait, no password.
[78:37.35]Multiplayer.
[78:39.01]Wait, never mind.
[78:39.65]Alright, server is up.
[78:41.31]Same password, same lobby.
[78:43.95]New seed.
[78:44.47]Okay.
[78:46.62]Dude.
[78:49.04]There was no control in that car down that hill, by the way.
[78:51.30]There was just no way.
[78:54.48]Oh, man.
[78:59.94]Yeah, one of you guys was in the... Okay, what is that blue screen setting?
[79:03.77]Like, Poke, where are you right now?

[79:11.47]Oh, you're in... It shows your menu.
[79:15.35]Like, the main menu?
[79:16.53]That's so weird.
[79:18.75]Ah, we got a perfect vehicle this time.
[79:20.78]How'd you get the blue screen?
[79:22.60]We're in the desert this time, too.
[79:26.37]Uh, we got a great car.
[79:27.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[79:28.59]Let me, let's double check.
[79:29.52]I tabbed out for a second.
[79:30.64]Does this lead to the blue screen?
[79:32.66]Yes.
[79:34.42]So tabbed out, tabbed out.
[79:35.36]Jesus.
[79:38.02]Alright, bye.
[79:39.24]No, I'm just getting out the car.
[79:40.69]Yeah, so Vinny, tabbing out is what gets the blue screen up?
[79:44.35]Can I see it when you do it?
[79:48.11]Oh, okay.
[79:48.45]Yeah, there you go.
[79:49.51]Oh, so that's what it was.

[80:22.04]Stop!
[80:22.76]Give me the- Give me the gun!
[80:23.62]Give me the gun!
[80:25.78]Give me the gun.
[80:26.70]Here, do you want the ammo?
[80:28.32]I don't want this thing.
[80:29.54]Yeah, I want the ammo too.
[80:30.54]Alright, go ahead.
[80:32.24]I'm actually going with the ammo.
[80:34.02]I'm the second worst person to have this.
[80:37.15]The second worst, okay.
[80:38.47]Well, at least you can quantify it.
[80:40.81]Somebody get the revolver.
[80:42.79]Yeah, I think having so many barrels in the car is fucking up the driving.
[80:47.21]You think so?
[80:48.23]Yeah.
[80:50.08]Where is the revolver?
[80:54.30]Uh, in the chimney.
[80:59.14]Okay, I'm just gonna fill up the small tanks then.
[81:00.65]Okay, gas.
[81:05.91]Gas.
[81:07.99]Gas.
[81:09.43]You literally, like, infected my vocabulary with the way you say that word.
[81:15.19]Gas will fill the room.
[81:17.20]That's, yeah.
[81:24.42]What are you doing?
[81:28.30]I'm looking.
[81:28.80]What are you doing?
[81:30.46]I'm looking at this magazine.
[81:31.68]Hey, that.
[81:34.02]Not old enough for that.
[81:37.06]Go to your room.
[81:39.20]That was my mom.
[81:40.93]I was proud of her.
[81:45.47]Where'd you put it?
[81:46.11]Right on the ground.
[81:52.63]Get this fucking thing out of here!
[81:54.69]Get this thing out of here, mommy!
[81:56.58]Get this thing out of here!
[82:05.08]I just see Vinny coming up with a giant fucking cartoon tumbleweed!
[82:13.45]This bike is broken.
[82:14.49]There's no way we're... This is... It's just moving on its own, but it's like... Alright, so are we ready?
[82:19.71]Yep.
[82:19.89]Yes.
[82:21.83]Alright, can we get a save?
[82:22.85]I, uh... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[82:25.16]Hold on.
[82:25.40]Alright, let me save it.
[82:27.40]No leaking.
[82:30.70]Alright, we are officially completely saved.
[82:37.34]Saving takes out the fun of the roguelike aspect of the game, no?
[82:41.71]That's true.
[82:43.31]But my... I would like our car to survive a second checkpoint.
[82:47.19]Ster, do you want to try driving?
[82:48.81]I just want to see if we can do it.
[82:50.05]No, I don't have a license.
[82:52.45]Oh, my famous tumbleweed joke.
[82:54.39]Oh, why didn't the tumbleweed roll into the saloon?
[82:57.66]Why not?
[82:58.64]What?
[82:58.74]Because it was dry.
[82:59.48]Oh, wait.
[83:05.24]Is it because of this?
[83:08.32]Oh.
[83:09.48]Oh, man.
[83:10.56]Oh, man.
[83:11.04]That bombed so hard.
[83:12.22]I'm going to have to show you that one.
[83:15.64]Dry on money?
[83:17.36]No.
[83:19.68]It means you don't drink when you're dry.
[83:21.80]Damn.
[83:24.48]Oh, that's right.
[83:25.30]Actually, now that I know about it, I'm just going to have to shoot you in the leg.
[83:29.16]Go ahead.
[83:32.34]Alright.
[83:39.67]Just save now.
[83:40.29]I made the car clean.
[83:43.03]Wait, before you save, let me get this back on.
[83:48.17]I love this game.
[83:48.93]This game is so fucking stupid.
[83:53.03]I'm always the first one in the car.
[83:56.81]I'm ready.
[83:57.87]It's hot in here.
[83:59.33]The AC is not on if the car's not on.
[84:04.47]Good thing we got the doll, the medical doll, in case anyone needs to practice CPR.
[84:08.40]Smart.
[84:09.62]Now quit fucking around back there.
[84:12.48]I ain't making this- I ain't saying this twice.
[84:15.74]Stay back there.
[84:16.82]Keep your arms in the car.
[84:18.10]Don't get out for any reason.
[84:19.19]You understand?
[84:19.83]You get it?
[84:20.35]Dad, put the gun down!
[84:21.93]Yes, Paul McCartney.
[84:23.29]Whatever you say.
[84:26.03]I'm gonna... All three years.
[84:27.33]All three years I want you in the back.
[84:31.23]Wait, put the wife in the front.
[84:34.05]The wife.
[84:35.17]Hey, hey, give me that.
[84:37.88]No, front seat.
[84:41.36]Here's mom, dad.
[84:43.34]Oh, thanks.
[84:44.00]Thanks, son.
[84:47.25]Alright, sweetheart.
[84:47.95]You ready to go?
[84:48.67]Take the kids on a nice sightseeing trip.
[84:51.96]And yes, I brought the gun.
[84:54.44]Okay, kids.
[84:56.00]So who wants to stop?
[84:56.90]You want to stop and get an ice cream first or on the way back?
[84:59.72]What do you think?
[85:00.64]Mom said I have to scratch her head.
[85:03.77]The whole car ride.
[85:05.83]Okay, son.
[85:06.61]You can do that if you feel like it.
[85:08.31]What about middle son?
[85:10.65]Middle son.
[85:11.25]Where would you like to go first?
[85:13.15]Ice cream or would you like to go sightseeing first?
[85:17.30]Ice cream.
[85:18.48]You got it.
[85:19.48]You got it.
[85:20.04]I want ice cream.
[85:20.98]I want to go get ice chocolate.
[85:23.08]Ice cream.
[85:23.98]Wowee.
[85:24.64]You all got it.
[85:26.14]Are we there yet?
[85:28.22]Not quite.

[85:40.41]McDonald's.
[85:41.87]Three sons.
[85:43.17]Which one of your three sons didn't close the back fucking trunk?
[85:46.17]Alright.
[85:52.22]That's how we do it.
[85:53.16]I have a hematoma.
[85:54.80]That's how we do it.
[85:55.50]Now, please get back in, son.
[85:57.24]Thank you, son.
[86:00.30]That was wrong with my neck.
[86:05.10]Okay.
[86:08.73]Left or right?
[86:09.23]You're going to look at us the whole way?
[86:10.99]This is a level of scrutiny I'm not ready for.
[86:15.53]We're heading this way.
[86:18.13]It's this way to McDonald's.
[86:20.85]No, the light should be on the right side.
[86:24.79]Who keeps putting the death spikes on the front?
[86:30.39]I want to make sure I got my eyes on my three boys, you understand?
[86:34.29]Make sure that it happens to them.
[86:38.33]Do we not fuck with the death spike?
[86:40.65]I mean... We'll see.
[86:46.12]How old are you now?
[86:47.74]Middle son, how old are you now?
[86:49.22]Are you in third grade yet?
[86:51.39]I'm 3,000 years old.
[86:54.75]I just look like a little boy.
[87:00.11]Ah, Vinny's doing the blue screen thing again.
[87:02.01]Dad!
[87:03.25]Hold on a second.
[87:11.37]You need to put your eyes on the world.
[87:14.77]I just wanted to make sure you sons were alive, you know?
[87:17.67]That's all I was trying to do.
[87:22.49]Where's Mom?
[87:22.91]Oh, she's in the front seat.
[87:26.11]I'm gonna brown.
[87:27.49]Oh, Dad.
[87:30.16]Please put Mom down.
[87:31.22]Please put Mom down.
[87:32.08]The more you pick up Mom, the more we glitch.
[87:35.66]I'm shitsing.
[87:37.00]I think Mom fell through the car.
[87:40.13]Is Mom gone?
[87:40.83]I'm bored!
[87:41.35]I'm bored!
[87:43.65]No, wait, Mom is in the backseat.
[87:44.79]Cut that out!
[87:45.27]Cut the shit right now!
[87:47.95]I'm bored!
[87:50.76]I'm bored!
[87:55.96]We have not been on the road for, like, a day at all!
[87:58.54]Hey!
[87:58.76]Hey!
[88:00.48]Cut it out!
[88:02.18]The car overheated.
[88:02.72]I don't want to have to use it.
[88:03.48]Why is the car smoking?
[88:04.83]Hold on a second.
[88:06.19]I need to... Everybody out.
[88:08.37]Everybody out.
[88:09.57]How is it smoking already?
[88:12.47]What do we even do?
[88:16.96]Look at the car.
[88:19.14]Alright, get everybody in.
[88:21.86]It actually needs more gas.
[88:24.70]No way.
[88:26.68]Let me turn the car off.
[88:30.62]How do I turn the car off?
[88:33.35]I need to put more ratio of oil now.
[88:38.48]Oh, I see.
[88:40.16]I understand now.
[88:42.32]What's wrong with the radiator?
[88:55.09]Maybe we can... Yeah, it's all fucked.
[88:58.51]These cars don't last long, do they?
[89:02.19]Why is the radiator so fucked up?
[89:03.73]What's going on?
[89:07.27]Pee on it.
[89:08.98]Oh.
[89:12.15]Everyone piss me.
[89:13.23]I think that worked.
[89:23.65]Hmm, no, it's still on fire here.
[89:32.22]Oh, hold on.
[89:34.26]Oh, wait, we're good.
[89:35.48]We're pretty good.
[89:38.76]Okay, mom, going.
[89:43.82]I'm the middle child now.
[89:44.48]Wait, are we not supposed to have oil in there?
[89:45.60]But the car spawned with oil in there.
[89:48.97]I think I can drive it.
[89:51.91]Yeah, are we good?
[89:52.89]Okay.
[89:54.27]Alright, just a little bit of a detour.
[89:56.43]All of you kids.
[89:57.97]Stay back there.
[89:59.73]We're going the right way.
[90:01.37]I think you need to turn right at the next light.
[90:07.64]Okay, will do.
[90:09.60]Can we go to McDonald's?
[90:11.56]McDonald's is absolutely on the trip.
[90:13.80]Hey kids, by the way.
[90:23.33]Take care of yourself.
[90:25.03]He just jumped out of the car.
[90:27.63]Help!
[90:28.39]Daddy!
[90:32.25]We almost had it!
[90:33.59]I was just gonna say the car finally isn't teleporting on my screen for me.
[90:37.23]It was a smooth ride.
[90:38.35]What are you gonna do?
[90:39.53]What are you gonna do about it, huh?
[90:40.85]What are you gonna do about it?
[90:42.22]What are you gonna do about it?
[90:44.68]Yeah, I made a fucking steal!

[91:10.37]I don't even... This car is fucked.
[91:16.41]Whoa, Vinny is... I actually don't think I can drive it.
[91:31.85]Are we walking?
[91:33.21]We might have to walk.
[91:34.11]No, no, no.
[91:35.85]Okay.
[91:37.39]No, no, that's just the music.
[91:39.61]You thought it was working?
[91:41.12]Because the music sounds... I thought the car was moving.
[91:43.92]I was like, oh shit, it works.
[91:49.17]Open the cap on the radiator and fill it up more We have water in the back you don't have to piss every time right?
[91:56.19]Well, this is water.
[91:57.34]I don't I Don't know how to empty and refill it like what's actually happening.
[92:01.70]Oh
[92:12.43]I don't know how to like pour it It's we keep spawning with this piece of shit engine.
[92:17.11]Yeah, this is giving us a terrible engine Going away for it.
[92:19.49]I don't oil in the radiator.

[92:20.29]Yeah.
[92:20.57]Yeah Go in the trunk and crouch run You mean the cool it?
[92:41.58]We don't put oil in the coolant, no.
[92:42.82]Let me see the water.
[92:44.30]I'm going under.
[92:45.42]Maybe the coolant is just very bad.
[92:46.74]It looks so gray.
[93:07.96]Yeah, maybe it's just rusty, that's why.
[93:09.94]Water in the coolant.
[93:10.62]Wait, I think the coolant is just old.
[93:14.38]Like, it's just bad quality coolant.
[93:16.52]Oh.
[93:18.71]The hell is going on?
[93:19.37]I'm scrubbing it, hold on.
[93:24.01]Um, it actually, it's not smoking anymore.
[93:27.61]Uh, I accidentally pulled the engine through the bottom of the car.
[93:30.89]Might be why.
[93:33.00]Someone said rusty things don't work well.
[93:36.59]Oh, it's probably just rusty.
[93:38.49]Bad.
[93:39.61]Okay, that's good.

[96:30.57]Sorry, it was the cigarettes making me feel weird.
[96:32.87]Well, we'll know it's the right way or the wrong way if we pass our house again.
[96:38.90]You guys, don't quiet down.
[96:39.82]You're going to sit on the front rack.
[96:42.26]Wait, there's something over there.

[97:29.11]That might be a very bad idea.
[97:30.91]Yeah, when you have like two physics objects going at once, it's over.
[97:34.61]I would say, can we get a save?
[97:37.67]Yeah.

[97:39.97]Can we get a McNugget?
[97:46.12]Saved.

[99:41.95]No, no.
[99:42.23]We got this.
[99:43.19]Can you not?
[99:44.11]Alright.

[99:57.12]I'm getting this motherfucker as far away as possible.
[99:59.94]Nice, nice, nice.
[100:00.44]It's good now.
[100:00.88]I unattached it.
[100:02.94]This thing is kind of nice, actually.
[100:04.18]Is there gas in it?
[100:10.48]There's no engine, I think.
[100:12.99]Wait, where's the... Oh, down here.
[100:18.61]Ew, small-ass engine.
[100:22.45]Is it better than what we have?
[100:24.09]No, but we have a new engine in the new car.
[100:26.85]Oh.
[100:28.89]Apparently, we can put the seats in the back of this trunk.
[100:31.71]I can't get out.
[100:33.99]I can't get out.
[100:35.95]Okay.

[102:44.91]Diddy, are you okay?
[102:47.67]I'm okay.
[102:48.79]There's another wife down there and I was trying really hard to get her.

[102:56.09]I feel like it would be kind of sick.
[102:57.47]Oh, can you grab the wife?
[103:00.05]How do you even open the engine to this?
[103:10.63]I got her.
[103:11.43]I'm gonna throw her out.
[103:13.15]If you hold F, you can throw.
[103:14.99]Oh, nice, dude.
[103:16.32]Nice.
[103:16.58]Alright.

[103:18.82]Spam space.
[103:19.26]Yeah.
[103:20.10]You can spam space.
[103:20.78]It works.
[103:21.38]Okay.
[103:21.90]That works.
[103:22.34]Cool.
[103:22.48]Alright.
[103:23.04]New wife.
[103:23.48]Good, good, good, good.
[103:27.06]How do we attach it?
[103:29.15]Vinny, Vinny, get in here.
[103:30.09]Alright.
[103:32.51]I don't know.
[103:33.59]Usually it's G.
[103:41.31]You should bring me to Jerma.
[103:42.73]Oh, God.
[103:43.17]I'm trying.
[103:43.61]I'm trying.
[103:45.03]It's not what you think it is.
[103:45.87]It doesn't work as good as you think it looks.
[103:47.95]Where are you guys?
[103:50.47]Oh, it looks awful.
[103:51.35]Yeah, it looks awful.
[103:52.48]Here, but stay in there.
[103:53.20]Let me try to, like, slow you, bring you, slowly bring you to Jerma and Ster.
[103:58.48]No, it doesn't really work.
[103:59.80]It doesn't work.
[104:01.02]It looked very funny.
[104:03.68]Check the engine of the third car.
[104:04.92]Which one's the third one?
[104:09.36]Bottom left while holding it.
[104:15.86]Oh my god.
[104:18.70]You guys are gonna be happy.
[104:20.71]I'm coming with it.
[104:21.19]I'm coming with it.
[104:22.67]I'm coming with it.
[104:24.61]Yes.
[104:25.75]Yes.
[104:26.51]There's another.
[104:26.93]We already have a seat.
[104:29.23]Yeah.
[104:29.61]Oh, a seat.
[104:30.69]How do we attach it?
[104:34.25]I think it actually stays with it.
[104:36.01]Does it just stay there?
[104:37.47]Yeah.
[104:37.73]Oh, yeah, because we have all the internal set to lock options, I guess.
[104:43.78]What do we want to do with this?
[104:49.36]I mean, we could do something.
[104:51.14]We'll just hold on to it.
[104:52.06]I don't know.
[104:53.06]What if we did... You want to double it up?
[104:57.70]Like, right behind it.
[104:59.42]So that way... Yeah, let me get out.
[105:03.08]That way, yeah, we get more players.
[105:05.20]If someone's fighting, we can be like, yeah, never mind.
[105:06.62]I'm not looking at you.
[105:08.90]Oh, that's a good idea.
[105:11.98]I like it.
[105:15.34]I think, yeah, a gunner seat.
[105:16.51]I like it.
[105:17.87]A gunner seat.
[105:25.42]I thought this dude was alive.
[105:32.40]My fucking face hurts from laughing at this game.
[105:34.92]Chad, are you seeing this?
[105:37.70]Boom, perfect.
[105:38.38]Chad, is this real?
[105:40.40]Guys, there's some crazy stuff happening with a corpse and a blow-up doll.
[105:44.79]Wait, what?
[105:46.21]I am not doing anything.
[105:47.45]It's just doing it on its own.
[105:50.75]In the diner, if you're interested in seeing something.
[105:53.09]Sure, sure.
[105:53.59]Is that why our frames have been dropping by like 25%?
[105:57.13]Maybe.
[105:57.61]I feel like my computer is trying to struggle to host the game.
[106:06.36]Let's see.
[106:08.18]I'm at 30 FPS right now.
[106:11.14]Whoa, bipoke.
[106:13.72]I'm here.
[106:15.56]How did you do that?
[106:17.61]If you spam jump on a wall, it'll launch you.
[106:20.45]It's weird.
[106:22.11]Holy shit, that's actually fucking cool as hell.
[106:26.24]I just found a new engine.
[106:32.82]Just like people.
[106:33.62]What happened?
[106:39.47]What is this stuff?
[106:41.11]I just hit a flashbang.
[106:45.71]What is all this?
[106:46.39]Like a dumpster?
[106:47.81]This is good loot.
[106:49.27]That was weird.
[106:50.11]Oh my god, that was so loud.
[106:56.11]I'm sorry, chat.
[106:56.82]That sucked.
[106:58.76]Wait, let's get this engine.
[107:00.98]That's a good engine.
[107:01.76]That thing looks pretty powerful.
[107:02.72]That thing looks sick.
[107:03.84]I think so, yeah.
[107:06.16]Chat, where'd wife number four go?
[107:08.42]Did you see that?
[107:09.00]She, like, blew up.
[107:11.51]What if we attach this to the car?
[107:13.31]Oh, Vinny, you do have a cookie.
[107:15.59]Yeah, I'm gonna leave it here for you.
[107:16.83]I'm just drinking gas.
[107:22.66]Where did the engine just go?
[107:26.20]John, I'm really upset she's gone.
[107:31.70]My bar was full.
[107:32.56]I just spammed it to get rid of it.
[107:39.54]I feel like every place we stop is the amusement park.
[107:43.95]Oh, look at this old house.
[107:45.53]We should have made the car way close to the front.
[107:48.43]I can drive it.
[107:50.49]Like that.
[107:52.85]I am the dad.
[107:53.71]Fuck!
[107:55.97]Or someone wants to drive the first car here?
[108:02.45]I think both the cars are right here, right?
[108:11.18]Oh, they are here.
[108:11.84]Yeah.
[108:19.56]Where's the other cars?
[108:21.06]I found the new seat.
[108:21.90]I don't know if we need another seat.
[108:25.24]We have a lot of seats.
[108:26.24]Alright, what does this take?
[108:28.65]Oil?
[108:31.33]Oil tank.
[108:35.31]Where's our oil?
[108:37.97]We didn't lose a bunch of it, did we?
[108:40.94]I put everything in the back.
[108:41.92]Damn, organized.
[108:43.64]Organized.
[108:45.80]Oh, my God.
[108:46.42]This is feng shui back here.
[108:49.62]I just space out every once in a while, and I start playing the game.
[108:54.30]It's a bad habit I have when we play together.
[108:56.36]This is swanky.
[108:57.16]I like it.
[109:00.08]Which one are we using?
[109:00.84]This one?
[109:02.46]Cool.
[109:02.98]Looks good.
[109:03.42]Alright.
[109:05.40]I'm putting the new engine in.
[109:06.14]I don't know if it fits, but it'll fit.
[109:08.18]Vinny, what happened to you over there?
[109:09.06]I heard you.
[109:09.38]You've heard an exclamation from you.
[109:12.20]Um, there was a big explosion.
[109:13.60]I hit a crate with a shovel, and it was a flashbang, like a Call of Duty flashbang.
[109:24.37]I'm gonna remove the pooler.
[109:26.95]Take out the water from here.
[109:28.69]We have water or no?
[109:32.23]I don't know.
[109:32.70]I think we had one.
[109:33.40]Yeah, this one's mixed with oil, so I'm gonna take it out.
[109:43.16]I can set us back to daytime in a second here, too.
[109:56.25]Switching to daytime in three seconds.
[109:59.47]I'll just drink it.
[110:02.24]Oh, that's gas.
[110:04.54]This is gas.
[110:07.20]Oops.
[110:10.22]Somebody...
[110:12.71]Is there another car driving?
[110:14.01]No, okay, never mind.
[110:14.77]We're good.
[110:23.05]I mean, it's weird that you kind of just get used to people looking like this, but yeah, you kind of do.
[110:28.81]They look just like people.
[110:33.61]It looks like something in particular.
[110:35.17]Oh, shit.
[110:36.93]RPG character.
[110:37.69]I don't know what it is.
[111:01.57]Okay.
[111:06.43]Are we ready?
[111:07.39]I hear something spilling.
[111:11.43]Why do I hear something emptying?
[111:13.43]What's spilling?
[111:13.97]Yeah.
[111:16.04]There you go.
[111:19.62]Are we ready to load up?
[111:21.22]That was not me losing the water, right?
[111:23.04]Oh.
[111:26.16]It's okay.
[111:26.96]Are we?
[111:27.92]Do we have a sink in the house with water?
[111:29.31]Let's check the house.
[111:33.92]Wait, car's working?
[111:34.56]Seems like it's good.
[111:37.38]No, it's not driving.
[111:39.30]Unless someone's getting parked.
[111:40.92]Press space.
[111:45.93]No, still not driving.
[111:50.47]Press space again.
[111:51.69]Oh, I accidentally took the speedometer off.
[111:58.03]Happens.
[111:58.89]No way, it's a diesel engine.
[112:04.75]don't oh what does that mean did we pack diesel I don't think so I don't think we started with it wait it's apparently it's manual what it's a manual hold on let me see
[112:35.67]Where's the clutch?
[112:36.55]It sounds like it's working.
[112:38.09]It does, doesn't it?
[112:39.90]Oh, you moved.
[112:42.90]Are we just on a bad spot?
[112:46.84]Wait, hold on.
[112:50.82]No.
[112:56.07]Maybe it's this foot's fault.
[112:59.05]Nothing in the front of this, right?
[113:00.49]Nothing in the way.
[113:01.93]No.
[113:04.96]Oh, what is this?
[113:05.70]Something wrong?
[113:08.64]The fuel tank has a bunch of mixed stuff in it.
[113:11.98]Oh, what?
[113:12.88]Is that why?
[113:15.28]We got a bunch of junk in it?
[113:18.75]How are we supposed to know what it needs?
[113:20.93]Wait, somebody's saying it's control for the clutch.
[113:22.93]Hold on.
[113:24.53]No, no, it's definitely the gas.
[113:27.69]It's the fuel?
[113:28.77]Oh.
[113:30.22]I'm assuming it's gas because I know that engine is a gas one.
[113:35.10]Oh my god, what?
[113:35.68]Alright, I gotta tilt this car.
[113:41.71]I'm just happy to be here.
[113:42.97]Oh god.
[113:43.67]Honestly... Sounds like the engine's running, yeah?
[113:45.91]Alright, we gotta empty this gas.
[113:50.11]Um, no, I think I found the problem.
[113:51.51]Uh, I found the problem.
[113:56.04]What was it?
[113:56.44]What's the problem?
[113:57.70]Problem is, uh, just a small issue with a guy that is currently attached to this and needs to be pulled off of it.
[114:06.27]What?
[114:07.85]I think I crashed.
[114:08.43]Oh my god, you're right.
[114:09.61]He was invisible, but now he's not.
[114:11.29]What is... And, uh... Oh my god!
[114:14.31]Shots fired, shots fired!
[114:16.21]I crashed.
[114:16.75]I'm coming back in.
[114:17.87]Oh my god!
[114:18.39]So...
[114:23.40]Oh, boy.
[114:23.84]I teleported into the fucking sky and died.
[114:27.51]I got raptured.
[114:30.51]Yeah, we all got raptured.
[114:33.69]I just saw you T-posing.
[114:35.65]Yo.
[114:37.67]We might need to load the save.
[114:40.83]Are you really sure?
[114:41.77]I think it's... Are you sure?
[114:43.24]We're pretty sure.
[114:46.30]Where's the guy?
[114:49.38]He's turning into one of those parachutes in fucking gym class when you were like 10.
[114:56.62]Oh, dear.
[114:57.18]I didn't know a guy could be spread out this much.
[114:59.74]I got warped so far from you guys, I don't even know where you are.
[115:05.03]If you want, open up my stream if you want to know what's actually, because I'm hosting the game.
[115:09.97]Yeah, I'm going to need to watch that.
[115:11.39]Okay, hang on.
[115:13.01]What we're looking at here is a guy who is attached to the car, and he's been pulled.
[115:18.04]He just wants more viewers.
[115:19.64]I think this is his leg.
[115:24.83]This is his, this is him.
[115:25.99]Something just, dude, something just happened in my game.
[115:29.87]Guys, everyone come to my stream.
[115:31.15]I'm kidding.
[115:35.36]I'm going to block out the fucking sun with this guy's body.
[115:41.64]Oh my God.
[115:42.46]This is fucked up.
[115:43.28]I got launched a year away.
[115:45.41]Like a mile, like I'm in a whole different biome.
[115:49.03]Oh fuck.
[115:51.29]I'm turning this guy into an awning.
[115:54.00]Did we start over time?
[115:55.36]Is he a car door?
[115:56.42]I don't know, but he's as big as the whole game now.
[116:00.20]We're definitely going to have to reload.
[116:09.51]Chat, you got, like, it's insane.
[116:11.23]Like, you're just stretching this dude into an awning.
[116:14.79]It's amazing.
[116:27.13]This guy.
[116:30.99]I'll show you a little what's going on.
[116:32.21]There it is, chat.
[116:33.23]Take a look.
[116:34.55]Can you guys get, like, a better view?
[116:36.01]Can you guys get, like, a pulled out view?
[116:37.97]Wait.
[116:39.63]I'm just watching your stream.
[116:41.33]Yeah, I'm floating into the Earth.
[116:42.73]I don't exist.
[116:43.29]Oh, thanks.
[116:46.49]It's casting a shadow.
[116:48.77]It really is the Mr. Burns plot.
[116:51.86]What part of his body is this?
[116:54.00]Wait, I see a UFO in the air.
[116:58.04]Jerma, look up!
[116:58.54]Do you see a UFO?
[116:59.68]UFO?
[117:00.82]What?
[117:04.75]I feel like we used to play this game in gym class where you'd have like the giant fabric and everyone would run under it.
[117:09.53]Yeah, this is- this is- my frames are starting to go pretty bad here.
[117:13.85]There's a U- there's a UFO- Is that Circle Games, sir?
[117:16.47]I'm afraid of what happens if I let go.
[117:18.67]Nothing.
[117:28.61]How do I find Jerma from here, chat?
[117:32.74]Fly overhead and locate them from the dude.
[117:35.22]I think I despawned him.
[117:36.66]I think it's fixed.
[117:37.20]Well, I mean, I'm under the Earth still.
[117:44.91]Did we turn off noclip?
[117:47.65]I think we reload the save.
[117:50.71]Which put us right before we got to the scary house.
[117:58.61]Chad, this is like impossible.
[117:59.89]There's no way I'm going to find them again.
[118:01.69]Ever.
[118:02.71]Yeah, Vinny, I think you are like across... I think two of you went across the whole video game.
[118:07.71]Wait, I'm just going to leave and rejoin.
[118:08.94]I'm just going to rejoin the server.
[118:11.22]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[118:11.96]That's a good idea.
[118:14.48]Also, make sure you hide your screen because there's really bad stuff there.
[118:24.06]Oh, I fixed it.
[118:25.52]I'm in.
[118:26.28]I think my frames are going back to normal.
[118:28.58]Yeah, I'm close to y'all.
[118:30.68]Oh shit, alright.
[118:33.00]Wait, where's the car though?
[118:34.73]Uh, everything is back here.
[118:39.45]I thought I was hiding my screen!
[118:40.79]I thought I was hiding my goddamn screen!
[118:42.73]Shit!
[118:44.89]It would be you, wouldn't it?
[118:46.41]Mr. Poopsmith.
[118:47.33]I think we're fine.
[118:47.93]I think it's fine.
[118:49.17]No, yeah, the password isn't shown, but there was some bad words there.
[118:51.93]Ugh, goddammit.
[118:53.33]Did you see the bad word?
[118:54.45]I was convinced that my screen was hidden.
[118:58.78]I had to look over.
[119:00.16]Alright, let me rejoin.
[119:01.30]I think it's fine.
[119:03.00]I mean, that might be bad.
[119:04.26]It might be some bad words, maybe, but I think the server should be fine.
[119:08.38]Let's just all delete our VODs.
[119:10.18]Yeah, yeah.
[119:11.14]Yeah, I'm going to shut down.
[119:12.28]I'm messaging Twitch.
[119:15.94]Let's just get this whole shit restarted.
[119:17.65]Let's see if Blizzard can bring my character back.
[119:23.13]I like that.
[119:25.01]Thanks.
[119:25.33]Alright, so where is the...
[119:29.87]Yeah, you're here, Vinny.
[119:30.43]You're good.
[119:34.41]Are we already, like, screwed, though?
[119:36.89]I don't think so.
[119:37.87]I mean... Wait, is this a save?
[119:42.81]Did you reload the save?
[119:44.73]Uh, no, I did not.
[119:47.37]You guys were building, like, a whole house?
[119:51.48]Oops, sorry, chat.
[119:52.56]I think we're fine.
[119:53.42]I think we got a whole other car over here.
[119:55.24]Yeah, but the engine... Oh, fuck.
[120:00.25]Alright, I'll reload.
[120:01.99]If I reload, I bet you... Sorry, hang on.
[120:04.73]I'll mute myself in the call.
[120:05.74]Hang on.
[120:06.74]Let me see.
[120:07.12]Ready?
[120:07.34]If I reload the save, let me see what happens.
[120:11.08]We put in so much work.
[120:13.26]Which one do we want?
[120:14.26]Wait, what's this right here?
[120:16.61]Oh, yeah.
[120:20.71]I don't know which... Did the other car just disappear?
[120:24.82]Yeah, no, it flew.
[120:25.60]I ate the poop again.
[120:26.76]What happened to this Jerm?
[120:28.57]I think I found the problem.
[120:31.13]Come in in the diner.
[120:33.29]Wait, you found the issue?
[120:34.85]I might have found the issue.
[120:36.75]Is this guy... What does this guy look like to you?
[120:44.28]He is not doing well.
[120:45.72]Let's put it that way.
[120:47.14]Okay, I wonder if this guy glitched the game.
[120:52.90]Can we pull him out of here?
[120:57.27]I just get his leg.
[121:10.10]Yeah, I think the save is from before we even got here.
[121:15.18]Do we want to just pull it back like 30 minutes?
[121:17.20]How do you guys feel?
[121:19.32]It's up to you.
[121:20.49]Yeah, I'll probably be for the best.
[121:22.29]Alright, let me see which one of these it really is.
[121:26.68]This game really just doesn't want to stay good for long.
[121:29.50]I can't... It sounds like... I mean, we... Okay, the saves I have is the truck is, like, upside down, unfortunately.
[121:43.79]Let's see where this takes us.
[121:54.15]Are we good?
[121:58.07]oh man so alright so where does this put us oh man come here oh we also had this whole other car out in the front I forgot about the truck the truck should be here somewhere oh man is the truck um built or is before we built the truck
[122:28.20]I don't even know where the... The truck is not even here.
[122:34.56]Why isn't our car turning on?
[122:36.42]That's not our car.
[122:38.42]Oh.
[122:40.34]There's, um... Okay, guys, I found, uh... I found some of the... Oh, wait, no, this isn't a truck.
[122:45.42]I found a station wagon.
[122:46.62]I think we're gonna just have... I think that truck may have been obliterated from the game.
[122:51.32]I think we're gonna have to take the station wagon.
[122:56.55]Yeah.
[122:58.52]The station wagon over here is glitched bad.
[123:01.22]I don't know about you guys, but I'm down to restart.
[123:04.22]No, this is not even the save you made.
[123:06.04]We're like right back where we were.
[123:07.38]Yeah, but it is though.
[123:09.24]Hold on.
[123:09.56]Let me try one more thing.
[123:20.77]What is this one?
[123:21.37]Part is really clean though.
[123:25.55]Oh.
[123:27.37]Wait, you can just load saves while we're in the game?
[123:31.15]This one, okay, this one is like before we got there.
[123:34.33]But this is like, we were about to, we were right about to go on the trip.
[123:40.55]I guess we can go right from there.
[123:41.35]We might as well do a new seed then, I guess.
[123:42.73]Might as well do it.
[123:43.43]We might as well go for it.
[123:44.69]Whatever you want to do is fine.
[123:46.27]Yeah, I'm good.
[123:47.15]I'm good.
[123:47.79]I'm just chilling.
[123:48.53]I'm gonna, man, do I want alcohol?
[123:49.97]See, saves are not good though because we already, we already know the path.
[123:53.70]Damn.
[123:54.92]Ah, that's true.
[123:55.40]We could just go right back.
[123:56.81]Okay, I'm gonna drive.
[123:59.03]Let me drive.
[123:59.53]I'm gonna drive past that place.
[124:02.43]We're not gonna go there.
[124:04.65]Are we sure?
[124:06.71]What about what we got like put this gas these tanks in the car?
[124:11.67]No, I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get alcohol.
[124:17.07]I'm gonna get pineapple juice.
[124:18.87]I always bring up pineapple when I'm talking to Jerma.
[124:20.87]We're gonna find a truck.
[124:22.93]We're gonna find a truck that's gonna need diesel.
[124:26.45]I'm going to use that bait.
[124:28.05]Vinny, are you going to have a little bit of drink?
[124:33.40]I don't know how to turn the car off again.
[124:35.06]I want to face.
[124:42.66]I'm good.
[124:43.00]I'm here.
[124:43.94]What happened?
[124:48.02]You were pushing the car forward.
[124:49.30]I'm sorry.
[124:53.08]Jerma, ask me something.
[124:53.98]Jerma, would you ask me?
[124:54.78]I'm sorry.
[124:55.28]Where the fuck is the ignition?
[124:56.76]I was getting pineapple juice, yeah.
[125:00.40]Maybe, maybe, crack a bush light maybe next time.
[125:03.46]I don't have those.
[125:06.41]Pineapple juice.
[125:08.87]Jerma asked you to do your Robocop impression.
[125:11.79]I don't think you did.
[125:12.43]I can't be ignored.
[125:13.97]Where is the ignition?
[125:17.49]It's already on.
[125:19.71]I want it off.
[125:20.41]How do you turn it off?
[125:21.47]Are we leaving?
[125:22.07]Where's I?
[125:23.53]Hi.
[125:25.05]Thank you.
[125:25.47]Okay, now let's go.
[125:28.17]Are we ready?
[125:28.63]Oh, okay.
[125:30.49]You just... Let's go.
[125:35.54]Alright.
[125:39.84]Hey, look, Dad.
[125:40.74]We're going to drive, right?
[125:43.02]Remember that one?
[125:44.60]I do remember that one.
[125:45.60]That was funny.
[125:46.52]That was a funny one.
[125:49.20]Alright, everybody.
[125:50.00]Keep your hands and your seats in the car.
[125:53.87]Don't do anything weird.
[125:55.01]I don't want to hear any jokes.
[125:56.47]We're going the wrong way.
[125:59.29]It's not so easy.
[126:09.12]Why do you get the middle seat?
[126:11.90]Yeah, that is weird.
[126:15.66]Hold on, I'm gonna mess with the radio.
[126:22.88]Vinny, can you move your body more to the right so I can touch the radio?
[126:25.38]I don't know how.
[126:28.70]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[126:30.84]How's that?
[126:32.40]Perfect.
[126:32.78]How'd you do that?
[126:33.94]Gotta hold Q.
[126:44.62]Oh, wait, you could do that.
[126:46.54]What the hell?
[126:47.62]You were like dogs putting your faces out the window.
[126:50.96]Wait, you could put your hands out the window.
[126:52.56]Oh, it's scary.
[126:53.10]You have to drive close to the poles, please.
[126:55.66]Drive close to the poles.
[126:58.70]Fast enough where our heads are leaning out the window.
[127:06.55]Oh, close.
[127:10.53]I said keep your heads in the car.
[127:15.02]This is the opposite of what Dad commands.
[127:23.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[127:25.11]What?
[127:27.25]I didn't know that there was forks.
[127:30.22]Which way?
[127:30.62]Oh, man.
[127:33.18]This is not so much a fork as it is a problem in the game.
[127:35.86]I would just go straight.
[127:38.04]I think it is a fort.
[127:38.96]Oh, where?
[127:40.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[127:41.32]Every time you... Something's open in the back!
[127:43.52]Oh, shit!
[127:48.14]Um... What's happening?
[127:50.86]Arturma, are you seeing this?
[127:53.34]Are we vertical?
[127:55.22]Why are we... You guys... You guys are just floating!
[127:58.48]You guys are just going higher and higher!
[128:01.22]Is this not lag?

[128:26.45]Guys?
[128:26.91]Guys?
[128:27.13]Do the capsule thing.
[128:27.97]Man, we almost got there.
[128:29.19]Vinny, can you get out?
[128:30.89]I'm trying.
[128:31.97]I'm out, and I am under the world.
[128:34.09]Yeah, I think it was my fault I put the barrel in the back.
[128:37.64]We needed the diesel, though.
[128:59.95]Shit.
[129:01.93]What?
[129:02.13]You just fell through the sky.
[129:03.27]Died.
[129:03.45]Dirt.
[129:03.67]Remember me.
[129:04.67]Died.
[129:05.45]Hold on, I'm trying to... Trying to make it work here.
[129:07.69]Oh, that didn't work.
[129:08.55]Oh, that didn't work.
[129:09.53]Hey, I'm back.
[129:33.62]I no longer have the ability to change my camera angle.
[129:41.26]Q. Q?
[129:48.32]No, it was C, right?
[129:52.48]Are you stuck in third person out of the car?
[129:54.94]No, I'm stuck in first person.
[129:56.18]I was going to do something, check out some camera angles.
[130:00.33]Vinny, do you know the chords to Horse With No Name by Chance?
[130:03.36]The whole song is A minor.
[130:06.32]There's no other chord.
[130:08.84]Yeah, I love Kendrick Lamar.
[130:10.54]I'm going to quickly reload the save, I think.
[130:13.91]Cool.
[130:15.11]Good idea.
[130:16.49]Look at me.
[130:16.87]Press space.
[130:21.61]And reload.
[130:23.45]Not a problem.
[130:24.21]Not a big deal.
[130:26.50]Oh.
[130:26.60]Okay.
[130:30.22]Man, if our destination were in the stars, we would have got there a few times.
[130:36.35]Fortunately, we have to go horizontal.
[130:38.95]It was as if an invisible giant picked up the car and was shaking it, trying to get change out of us.
[130:44.26]There's a UFO over the house.
[130:46.72]There's literally a UFO, for real.
[130:49.34]Look, look, look.
[130:50.82]Up above the house.
[130:51.84]Do you see it?
[130:52.28]I don't see it.
[130:52.78]It's green.
[130:53.38]No, not me.
[130:54.04]No.
[130:54.82]Dude, I'm going up there.
[130:58.92]I have to go home.
[130:59.60]My people need me.
[131:03.42]Oh, no.
[131:03.92]Why did the car just break?
[131:06.26]Every piece of it.
[131:10.09]It's fake.
[131:10.93]UFO's fake.
[131:11.63]It's not real.
[131:12.97]I have a theory.
[131:15.53]I think when someone goes too far, it just breaks everything out here.
[131:19.99]Oh, yeah, that too.
[131:20.83]If someone's too far away, everything...
[131:23.72]Fucks up.
[131:24.22]Yep.
[131:24.66]Load the game one more time?
[131:25.72]Sorry.
[131:26.24]I just saw a UFO.
[131:27.20]I saw a UFO.
[131:28.02]I got it.
[131:28.44]Hold on.
[131:29.20]Yeah, that's why two cars won't work.
[131:36.68]I actually don't think this is showing anything.
[131:38.00]I can... I don't have to... Oh, man.
[131:42.85]Yeah, the problem is Jerma is... It's Jerma.
[131:46.33]The other problem is Jerma.
[131:51.27]There's not a single problem at all.
[131:57.91]Everything that has happened on this stream so far has happened, and it's been an A-plus for me.
[132:02.24]For a reason.
[132:02.80]Okay, okay, okay.
[132:08.82]Guys, guys, guys.
[132:09.74]Legit, let's fill these small containers instead of the big barrels, and then we leave.
[132:14.83]Okay.
[132:15.01]And then save, save, and then we leave.
[132:17.59]That's the strat.
[132:19.13]We just need some diesel and gas, because we're going to find a new car, and we're not going to have anything to replace it with.
[132:23.15]Let's go.
[132:23.43]I'm going to get the sword.
[132:27.53]Ster, I wanted to thank you for the raid yesterday.
[132:31.26]Oh, to Vincent Sauce?
[132:33.14]Yeah, that's really cool.
[132:34.32]You literally raided Vince Sauce instead of me, so that's cool.
[132:37.44]Thanks, man.
[132:40.60]It was really funny, though.
[132:41.58]People were like, Vinny, Ster raided you.
[132:44.76]I'm like, I don't see anything.
[132:46.61]Who the fuck is Vince Sauce?
[132:49.71]It was really cool.
[132:51.92]Vinsauce is one of my favorite streamers.
[132:54.78]I bet he's good.
[132:55.60]I bet he's really good.
[132:56.94]You like throwing our water away?
[133:01.02]I'm gonna fill it with diesel or something.
[133:02.99]Also, no, that's beer.
[133:04.55]Well, drink it.
[133:05.61]Beer.
[133:06.89]It dehydrates you.
[133:09.17]Beer bad.
[133:10.43]That's a fucking medic.
[133:13.67]I mean, it's a game mechanic.
[133:22.93]Do we even need a car?
[133:23.67]Look at this.
[133:24.01]Do we have a sled?
[133:26.63]What?
[133:26.87]Oh my god.
[133:27.39]Can you guys sit on it?
[133:29.50]Can you guys sit on it?
[133:38.04]Let me go.
[133:40.30]Let me go.
[133:40.70]My people need me.
[133:44.50]Dude, I don't even need a car.
[133:51.55]Vinny?
[133:53.83]Alright, we're ready to move.
[133:59.47]What the heck?
[134:01.03]I'm stuck.
[134:02.82]Whoa.
[134:04.62]I'm actually really stuck down here.
[134:08.04]I might have to rejoin the server.
[134:10.24]I jumped on a shovel to ride it like a vehicle, and I'm stuck on it.
[134:17.84]Okay, it looks like we're getting another reload.
[134:20.17]Oh my god.
[134:20.61]No, no, no.
[134:20.85]I'm going to rejoin the server.
[134:21.79]That's all.
[134:22.11]I'll just disconnect and rejoin.
[134:23.97]If you... If you... Here, you try it.
[134:25.75]What is it?
[134:26.93]I'm measuring tape.
[134:29.07]If you swing it back too fast, it hurts you.
[134:37.27]Shoot it out.
[134:41.75]Ow!
[134:50.05]Wait, what the hell?
[134:50.69]It looks scary.
[134:53.43]Ooh, wrong password.
[134:54.49]That's weird.
[134:58.87]Chat, this game has another cool feature where the wrong... Oh.
[135:02.71]You want to play with it?
[135:06.09]Look.
[135:06.19]It's fun.
[135:07.85]I want to get in the car.
[135:09.17]Oh, okay.
[135:09.57]Let's get in the car.
[135:10.55]We reloaded to get in the car and we all split up.
[135:21.23]Alright, I'll drive.
[135:21.79]Alright, get this out of here.
[135:30.79]This is gonna make us fly.
[135:32.07]Get a nice saving.
[135:39.59]Save it here.
[135:43.12]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[135:46.96]I reload?
[135:47.52]Well, at least you saved.
[135:51.62]Wait, what's leaking?
[135:52.22]What's leaking?
[135:53.73]We made it three feet!
[135:55.51]It's fine, it's fine.
[135:56.59]Oh, no.
[135:57.61]What's leaking?
[135:58.17]Did he just die?
[136:02.09]Yes!
[136:02.27]I love this game.
[136:04.11]Yes.
[136:04.29]What the fuck?
[136:04.81]Where have I... Okay.
[136:26.21]Alright, are we ready to go?
[136:27.11]Yeah, let's go.
[136:29.75]No, you're not in the car.
[136:31.21]What do you mean?
[136:31.79]You're the only person not in the car.
[136:33.55]This shit is fucked.
[136:34.53]I think he's in the car, kind of.
[136:36.44]He's literally in the car, actually.
[136:38.12]Look at this door.
[136:39.40]This shit's not on right.
[136:40.50]Oh, the body.
[136:43.26]Dude.
[136:44.86]Oh, we're good now.
[136:46.24]We're good now.
[136:49.14]We're good now.
[136:49.68]Alright.
[136:50.22]All the gas on the ground.
[136:51.32]Are we just going?
[136:51.96]Are we rolling?
[136:54.47]Remove your doors.
[136:55.57]Remove your doors.
[136:56.69]Two and a half hours and two and a half feet travel.
[136:58.81]The doors are probably bugging us.
[137:00.11]Okay, we're good.
[137:01.05]Get in.
[137:02.03]Let's go, guys.
[137:02.43]Alright, let's go.
[137:03.27]I need my tunes.
[137:10.98]Can we just listen to the radio?
[137:11.84]I have some amazing news for you.
[137:19.62]Today is Monday the 9th.
[137:26.28]I mean, it's this fucking stinks in this car.
[137:28.32]I mean, we have to get my head out of here.
[137:31.43]I don't want to smell this.
[137:33.77]It's gross.
[137:39.49]Well, can you actually see if you can get me to hit my face on one of these poles?
[137:44.69]Yeah, yeah.
[137:48.59]Next one right here.
[137:50.07]This one here?
[137:56.28]There goes the front bumper and the cooler Alright, that was quick damn poke that was fast Is there collision
[138:23.57]Wait, there is.
[138:25.57]No, no, it is.
[138:26.95]Go back inside now.
[138:29.66]My face is flattened on this thing.
[138:33.86]Put your body back in.
[138:38.66]Oh, it does look like it has collision.
[138:40.16]Wow, that's crazy.
[138:42.40]This game is the most advanced not working game I've ever seen.
[138:49.31]Oh, fuck.
[138:53.67]How do you lean?
[138:56.30]What's happening?
[138:57.98]Hold, um, Q. Wait, Jerma, we can merge faces.
[139:06.38]Hang on, let me do that.
[139:10.59]The wheel is, like, actually just fucked.
[139:12.31]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[139:13.33]I feel like I'm steering this car right now.
[139:15.71]I think you're steering it.
[139:16.63]Are you driving?
[139:18.81]No, but I feel like whenever I press the direction, it's been driving the car.
[139:23.99]That is weird.
[139:26.11]Yeah, you're driving me.
[139:27.31]You're steering the car?
[139:30.01]What's going on here?
[139:31.81]This is wild.
[139:36.27]Yeah, look, the steering wheel, I'm turning it.
[139:38.13]I'm not driving.
[139:38.75]Everyone come out here and piss on this thing.
[139:50.67]Is it open?
[139:52.89]No, no, just pissing on it.
[139:53.99]Oh.
[139:54.11]I don't know if that helps or not.
[140:00.92]Oh no, it's just, I think we have to wait.
[140:03.68]I think we should reload the save because the car was already fucked before we started driving.
[140:06.96]Look at this, look at the road again.
[140:08.64]Every time we get here.
[140:09.70]We can't beat our PB of fork and road.
[140:16.64]Okay, I think the strategy is drive around the road to the left.
[140:20.58]You see what I mean?
[140:22.42]Dude, this game is a... Look, look, look, look.
[140:24.90]I can tilt out the car and actually move the hood.
[140:28.08]It's actually insane!
[140:32.13]Are you getting in?
[140:35.31]Is it drivable?
[140:39.03]Yeah.
[140:41.33]I'll just not touch any buttons because I'll turn you.
[140:43.45]Wait, how do you move your head up like that?
[140:47.86]Oh, the scroll wheel.
[140:49.54]That's so fucking cool.
[140:55.88]I can't see.
[140:56.34]Are you playing Mr. Fantastic recently?
[140:59.54]I'm leaning back like that.
[141:02.42]That's how I drive.
[141:05.02]Ster, can you hold Q and scroll up?
[141:12.65]Oh, shit.
[141:13.29]Mine doesn't work that way.
[141:15.95]Mine isn't doing that.
[141:17.25]I don't know why not.
[141:18.75]Alright.
[141:25.11]Oh, here we go.
[141:25.81]Because I was in camera mode.
[141:28.06]Oh, man.
[141:32.20]This car is struggling.
[141:46.47]Wait, no.
[141:47.09]Poke, you go all the way back?
[141:49.49]If you go back, it looks like we're driving real fast.
[141:54.08]Alright, yeah, it looks like I'm driving the car now.
[142:02.14]Why is it so slow?
[142:02.88]Wait, who's moving it?
[142:03.52]I'm sorry, I drove it.
[142:06.81]Sorry, sorry.
[142:10.37]Wait, I think the car is out of something.
[142:19.64]No, it has.

[142:43.25]Ah, damn it.
[142:46.45]Daytime incoming.

[143:51.60]I'm chilling out.
[143:56.77]Alright, Jeremy, you drive.
[143:57.55]Is this our PB?
[143:58.95]We're approaching the PB.
[144:01.17]PB is up here, over here.
[144:03.37]You want me to drive?
[144:04.59]Yeah, I can't.
[144:05.01]It's laggy.
[144:06.23]Alright, so where's the PB?
[144:08.63]Behind us.
[144:18.73]Yeah, yeah.
[144:21.15]Alright, let's get a PB.
[144:24.31]Ugh.
[144:32.45]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[144:33.39]Go that way, yeah.
[144:34.69]Okay.
[144:35.17]Yeah, yeah.
[144:36.63]I can see it the same way you see it.
[144:37.83]Wait, what?
[144:38.79]Am I going the wrong way?
[144:40.77]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[144:41.27]We're going to stay on this road.
[144:42.61]Am I going the wrong way?
[144:45.57]Oh, you're good.
[144:46.19]You're good.
[144:47.43]We're all just really intently interested in what you're doing.
[144:53.49]BB is approaching, that's why.
[144:54.95]Dude, it's like the fucking... We're like hiding from somebody.
[144:57.85]It's like the boys fucking ducking down, like something's coming.
[145:06.02]Alright, I'm moving.
[145:06.90]Let's go.
[145:08.48]I think I'm stuck this way.
[145:13.12]I'm still driving the car.
[145:15.22]I left my help spot.
[145:18.72]Okay, Jeremy, you just do the gas.
[145:20.63]I'll turn left and right.
[145:21.65]Can you lean back?
[145:22.99]No, no, no, no.
[145:23.49]We got to get a PB.
[145:24.19]We can't fuck around.
[145:24.79]PB.
[145:26.09]Yeah, no, no, you do gas.
[145:28.57]Just keep it going straight.
[145:29.97]And I'll do the turns.
[145:31.73]But what if it doesn't work?
[145:33.47]Yes, yes.
[145:34.71]Are you turning?
[145:35.29]What about this?
[145:35.95]Yes.
[145:36.85]No, you are not.
[145:37.95]Okay.
[145:39.25]Wait, can you get in the middle seat?
[145:40.80]What are you doing?
[145:43.08]On my screen, I'm turning.
[145:44.22]Alright, never mind.
[145:47.76]Oh, dude.
[145:48.84]I see what you... That's funny.
[145:49.92]Hang on, let me help.
[145:51.94]What are you two doing back there?
[145:54.06]What the fuck are you two doing back there?
[145:59.05]I just want to see if it works.
[146:04.28]Sorry, sorry.
[146:07.20]Trust me, these dudes are floppy in every way.
[146:13.63]This is going kind of fast!
[146:20.26]We lost one.
[146:22.44]I pressed the wrong button by accident.
[146:24.52]It's okay.
[146:24.98]Just keep going.
[146:25.58]Don't worry about it.
[146:26.34]No, I'm good.
[146:26.98]Are you dead?
[146:28.55]Yeah, I don't know.
[146:29.21]A little dead.
[146:31.83]Yeah, I'm a little dead.
[146:33.39]That's alright.
[146:34.07]I see the car.
[146:34.69]I see the car.
[146:35.23]I'll get there.
[146:37.47]No!
[146:38.03]What happened?
[146:41.84]Ster, Ster, it looks like you went through, you went, oh, I don't, okay.
[146:46.64]Wait, wait, wait, don't drive, don't drive.
[146:48.44]Gas is open.
[146:49.75]Gas.
[146:50.59]Yeah.
[146:50.99]I can't, I'm not doing it.
[146:52.23]Dude, who's doing that?
[146:53.47]Who's doing that?
[146:54.65]I'm not doing anything.
[146:56.03]Come back.
[146:58.15]Come back.
[146:58.95]I can't control it.
[147:00.15]Vinny is fucking with his hands.
[147:01.43]I'm sorry.
[147:08.38]Why am I able to push the vehicle while I'm inside the vehicle?
[147:11.42]Why not?
[147:11.74]We gotta get a PB for God's sakes.
[147:14.04]Everybody in.
[147:14.36]Everybody in.
[147:34.20]I think the backseat is now off.
[147:37.58]It's fine.
[147:38.06]It's fine.
[147:38.64]Don't worry about it.
[147:42.80]You crashed into a cactus?
[147:45.04]It's in the backseat, the piece of the cactus.
[147:47.68]I think it's breaking the car.
[147:51.88]You see the cactus in the car?
[147:55.80]Vinny, you have your fucking face.
[147:57.52]Your mouth is on your own dick right now.
[148:01.56]How did we get the full cactus loaded in the back?
[148:04.77]Why is the cactus in the car?
[148:08.95]Okay, I'm getting back to the road.
[148:10.39]I'm getting back to the road.
[148:11.23]On the right side.
[148:11.89]This is like a haunted house where like the Native American thing shouldn't have been there.
[148:16.42]Like, how did the cactus get in the back of the car?
[148:18.60]We have to get it back where it belongs.
[148:20.66]We need an exorcist.
[148:25.24]Oh, the coolant is out of the car.
[148:26.58]It's a rip.
[148:28.25]Alright, we're good.
[148:28.85]The coolant was not even in the bar.
[148:31.09]Vinny, this is not... Ster again.
[148:36.31]Ster, are you... Okay.
[148:37.73]Wait, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster.

[149:25.99]No, P&P's new script.
[149:26.99]Wait, it's new cars, it's new cars.
[149:27.95]There's a new car there.

[149:40.82]I need a reset moment.
[149:43.67]Should we save?
[149:45.45]Let's get out of the car first.
[149:46.33]I can see your intestines inside of you, but it's a coil of shit.
[149:52.89]I can't get out of the car.
[149:53.75]No, this car has a massive engine.

[154:37.02]This thing is going to be, this thing is going to go fast.
[154:38.98]I hope you guys are ready to go like more than 500 miles per hour.
[154:42.82]Dude, you can put a bus engine in a car.
[154:45.36]And it'll like, you can put any engine in any car, any wheel in any car.
[154:49.48]That's why I love this game.
[154:54.37]This game reminds me of, like, the stuff I was playing in, like, 2014.
[154:59.65]Just, like, whatever random janky game someone would send me.
[155:03.13]Yeah.
[155:03.91]It's just, like, stuck in ten years ago.
[155:07.21]Great.
[155:08.53]I want one of these seats.
[155:10.71]I'm so glad that multiplayer has been added to this.
[155:13.17]I remember when I first played this, like, a few years ago, it was just like, oh, that'd be funny to do this with people.
[155:16.90]And, yeah, it was.
[155:17.90]It is.
[155:18.92]It's great.
[155:20.32]Yeah, it really just all works.
[155:24.58]It just worked.
[155:29.72]What the fuck?
[155:30.44]What?
[155:32.88]What happened?
[155:35.96]I don't want to scream like this.
[155:39.58]I just, I held on Caps Lock.
[155:40.60]Oh, did you just find the scream?
[155:42.20]Yeah.
[155:43.42]Wait, that's sick, sir.
[155:44.23]Caps Lock and mouse wheel.
[155:45.99]Also, look up and down while you do that, and it changes the pitch.
[155:49.33]Sir, is there two of those stools?
[155:51.78]Uh, yeah, they're all in the diner inside.
[155:53.08]There's a bunch.
[155:53.52]Let's just put two of them in there and just sit in the back like that.
[155:55.76]Let's use the backseat for storage.
[155:59.54]Oh my god, that's so cool.
[156:03.71]Um... I'm okay with this.
[156:05.11]What is this... What's this game mechanic where you can push yourself off a wall while sitting on a toilet?
[156:14.55]Uh...
[156:21.26]Oh, it's got to be rotated right, otherwise you sit weird.
[156:25.51]I'm afraid to get up.
[156:27.55]Yeah, because you might glitch the floor.
[156:29.51]Okay, I'm going to get up now.
[156:31.75]Oh, God, I can't get up.
[156:34.74]Hold on.
[156:35.54]Set me up one more time.
[156:37.00]Wait, we can put the toilet in the car.
[156:38.76]It's heavy, though.
[156:39.62]Oh, I'm sorry.
[156:43.16]I can't.
[156:43.96]You're stuck.
[156:46.55]Got it.
[156:50.66]alright moment of truth who wants to test the car out oh my god he does a goddamn toilet now wait can you do the Skibidi Toilet thing with just your head sticking out of it
[157:13.08]Who wants to drive this piece of shit?
[157:14.68]Dude, this is probably not a piece of shit.
[157:17.02]This is probably the fastest car we've ever had.
[157:19.54]I'll drive.
[157:20.74]Let me drive.
[157:21.68]We need to save.
[157:23.38]I'll save it right here.
[157:24.41]This is real progress.
[157:25.45]Vinny?
[157:26.19]Vinny?
[157:27.89]Get off that roof right now, mister.
[157:29.79]Okay.
[157:32.87]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[157:33.57]Is there any brush anywhere?
[157:35.69]I'm looking for one.
[157:37.35]I found some headlights.
[157:38.57]This thing is dirty.
[157:40.73]We need your butt in a seat.
[157:43.15]This whole car is just... I'm looking for a brush.
[157:45.87]Oh!
[157:46.49]A soil texture.
[157:50.07]Clean the tires and the wheels.
[157:51.21]Is that working?
[157:58.57]The gas?
[157:59.99]You need, like, some... Yeah.
[158:00.71]You need liquid, I think.
[158:02.11]Oh, that worked.
[158:10.84]Nice, okay.
[158:11.48]Right?
[158:13.34]I think they did work, yeah.
[158:14.16]Looks better.
[158:14.50]Look at this I found, by the way.
[158:16.90]A metal detector?
[158:18.00]Cool.
[158:18.28]I may have found an AK-47.
[158:21.05]Let's take the dirtiest wheels out.
[158:23.75]Let's take the nicest wheels we have, too, from our car.
[158:27.05]Yeah, these wheels are kind of beat up.
[158:35.62]Hold on.
[158:36.38]It's very sunny out.
[158:37.86]This thing's got to go.
[158:38.74]It's going to cause a massive problem.
[158:40.80]Okay, that wheel's good.
[158:46.30]This wheel's nice.
[158:55.12]Let me make it daytime.
[158:56.08]Are the back wheels different?
[159:04.46]The back wheels are like these big ones.
[159:06.24]I hear a zombie out here in the back.
[159:09.41]Oh, other car.
[159:10.55]Let me shoot him.
[159:11.71]Yeah, you did not make it daytime.
[159:13.21]Yes, I did.
[159:15.21]Oh.
[159:16.05]Yeah.
[159:16.43]Never mind.
[159:17.01]Let's check the other cars in the house.
[159:19.69]That haunted house.
[159:20.93]Back here, there's some stuff.
[159:22.13]What's going on down here?
[159:23.09]In the well.
[159:25.99]You see an object phasing through the floor over here?
[159:31.67]Never mind.
[159:32.05]Don't worry about that.
[159:33.14]I'm going to the ground.
[159:36.65]Alright, I'm gonna kill this guy.
[159:40.35]Oh, a brush.
[159:41.19]A couple other cars here, yeah.
[159:42.45]Oh, another brush.
[159:44.05]Big.
[159:47.03]Do we need oil anymore?
[159:48.27]I mean, our car needs... Is this gas?
[159:54.57]There's gas in this one.
[159:58.50]Oh, my God.
[159:59.42]That was shot up into a coffin.
[160:06.38]Oh, guys, I gotta show you that clip.
[160:08.62]I'll show it to you tomorrow.
[160:09.64]It's really good.
[160:12.84]Holy shit, I'm gonna make this thing electric blue.
[160:16.17]Oh, someone get these tires over here.
[160:18.97]It's only one tire, that's good.
[160:20.25]This one over here, too.
[160:22.51]Can you get this one home?
[160:26.45]Vinny?
[160:27.52]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[160:28.00]Hang on.
[160:28.24]I'm just shutting this guy's coffin.
[160:30.58]This is gonna glitch the game.
[160:31.98]I can tell.
[160:32.44]This dude is... The corpses in this game are fucked.
[160:36.42]I'll grab... Which tire?
[160:37.78]I put a tire in front of you.
[160:40.80]Oh, the trailer tires.
[160:41.60]Let's see those.
[160:43.02]Ew, look at that blue finish on there.
[160:45.71]Oh.
[160:52.01]Nice.
[160:53.53]Blue and brown.
[160:54.75]Those are good colors to contrast together.
[161:02.82]The tires?
[161:04.02]Blue rims?
[161:07.30]I got brushes and stuff.
[161:10.86]Can I brush this car?
[161:12.53]I think you can brush the corrosion off.
[161:16.63]Oh, yes.
[161:20.11]I used all the paint on the rust.
[161:21.33]There's another one.
[161:29.06]I got a tire.
[161:30.20]Hulk got me this tire.
[161:32.12]Save it for the tires.
[161:33.60]There's not a lot of room back here because of all of these ladies.
[161:37.22]You can get rid of them.
[161:38.24]It's fine.
[161:42.31]Yeah.
[161:42.57]Vinny just discards them when he's done.
[161:48.73]That's what I fucking hear.
[161:49.59]Hey, guys.
[161:51.67]Oh, the sponge is after you clean it.
[161:53.99]Oh, my God.
[161:54.55]Look how shiny it is.
[161:56.04]We got any more brushes to do the front here?
[161:59.23]I have a brush, yeah.
[162:02.05]Here, you do it.
[162:02.64]Guys, I found a cat.
[162:04.18]Is... Is this normal?
[162:07.50]Oh, it's a dog.
[162:08.06]It's a Chihuahua.
[162:09.88]We should bring him.
[162:12.20]Yeah, I agree.
[162:12.88]Let me see if I can attach that.
[162:14.02]Okay.
[162:19.15]No.
[162:19.87]No, can't attach.
[162:22.09]Damn, this shit's shiny as hell.
[162:23.45]Let's take the bumper off.
[162:26.29]It's ugly.
[162:27.51]Ooh, look at this thing.
[162:28.67]Sir, do you have a chihuahua?
[162:31.30]Uh, unfortunately, yes.
[162:34.38]Wow.
[162:35.28]Wait, why do you have one if you don't want one?
[162:38.48]Uh... Oh, that bumper's gotta get scrubbed.
[162:41.72]Kindness.
[162:43.51]Kindness to all chihuahuas.
[162:48.05]A small Mexican chihuahua.
[162:51.47]Yeah, get a good scrub on that, folks.
[162:54.71]Out of brushes.
[162:55.57]Out of hairs.
[162:57.16]Shit.
[162:59.42]Guys, I'm going to need you to put this cone on your head.
[163:02.06]There might be another brush inside the diner.
[163:04.64]Man, this thing looks nice.
[163:07.87]I can't wait until we drive 10 feet.
[163:12.11]Sir, can you put this on your head, please?
[163:18.51]Thank you.
[163:19.63]You better take those off before we get in the car.
[163:21.49]Those things are going through the roof and we're going to flip.
[163:24.75]No, we'll stay outside.
[163:25.97]Oh, you guys will be outside?
[163:27.51]You'll be long guys outside.
[163:30.01]Yeah, we'll be long.
[163:36.35]Are we looking for another brush?
[163:38.89]If there is one in there, it'd be great.
[163:42.21]I'm stuck.
[163:42.85]I'm a sponge.
[163:45.27]I'm stuck.
[163:47.77]I don't need this anymore.
[163:48.64]What is the...
[163:55.29]You guys did a good job with this vehicle.
[163:58.05]It looks good, doesn't it?
[163:58.79]Yeah, it's not bad.
[163:59.97]What about the bumper?
[164:02.80]Unfortunately, we need a brush.
[164:04.98]Oh, okay.
[164:05.70]Okay.
[164:06.82]What if I use the sponge, though?
[164:08.34]Let me try.
[164:13.00]Yeah, that's brushed, right?
[164:14.96]Oh, yeah.
[164:15.62]I'll save it here, too.
[164:17.56]Wait.
[164:20.43]Put the tire on.
[164:24.59]Okay.
[164:27.73]Alright, I gotta save here.
[164:31.63]Uh, Poke?
[164:32.09]Where's Poke?
[164:33.12]Coming.
[164:34.92]Let's check into the house.
[164:36.52]Oh, whoa.
[164:44.24]I just showed my wiener on stream?
[164:46.42]What?
[164:47.40]Oh, okay.
[164:47.72]Again?
[164:59.49]I hate that word, by the way.
[165:01.17]Wait, there's a brush inside the sink.
[165:02.35]What, wiener?
[165:04.09]Yeah, that word sucks.
[165:05.73]Wait, there's brushes on the sink.
[165:08.05]Oh, big, big, yeah.
[165:09.97]Grab that brush.
[165:10.61]Two of them?
[165:11.13]Two of them, there's two of them.
[165:16.13]Ah, this is a poop.
[165:18.05]Oh, these are all shits.
[165:19.15]Okay, sorry.
[165:23.60]It looked like a brush.
[165:25.28]Okay, we should trial the tires.
[165:28.78]Is all the tires perfectly clean?
[165:40.81]Are you guys on fucking meth?
[165:44.49]What OCD is this?
[165:46.17]You saw that?
[165:48.03]We want it to be clean!
[165:49.63]How do I drink this?
[165:52.11]Oh, this brush is dead.
[165:52.75]And where's that paint can?
[165:57.37]How do I drink this?
[165:59.53]Yeah, sometimes you can't drink them.
[166:00.65]Sometimes it just, like, doesn't let you.
[166:03.83]Cue mode in lean?
[166:07.75]Oh, not looking good.
[166:09.22]Three more brushes under the sink.
[166:11.48]What?
[166:12.06]Wow, that's beautiful.
[166:13.76]Oh!
[166:16.06]There is... Oh, that's what those were.
[166:21.95]I had seen them earlier.
[166:24.35]Wasn't sure.
[166:24.81]This thing is shaping up to be a pretty damn beautiful, good car.
[166:30.17]Damn fine.
[166:33.85]Damn fine.
[166:39.00]Maybe we bring a brush with us for the next journey.
[166:43.74]The mirror is dirty.
[166:44.62]Then he put water in the bucket.
[166:49.46]Where'd you see a bucket?
[166:51.22]Oh, goys.
[166:52.68]Yeah, this mirror on the right side is dirty.
[166:55.02]This is a nice car, too.
[166:56.66]Damn.
[167:00.51]Does it have a radio?
[167:01.15]Yeah, it does.
[167:05.28]You want me to turn the jams on?
[167:07.46]Yeah.
[167:08.62]Put some classical on.
[167:10.96]How do I turn it on?
[167:12.22]Pink Floyd.
[167:13.14]Put Pink Floyd on.
[167:14.02]How do I turn it on?
[167:22.75]No one knows.
[167:24.32]Oh, you have to hit the... Oh, yeah, Queens of the Stone Age.
[167:27.44]Good one, Star.

[167:31.53]That's a good one.
[167:32.25]Oh.

[169:35.61]I don't know how to turn this off.
[169:37.79]Green, right?
[169:45.36]I can't even get out of the car.
[169:46.66]My game is just steadily dropping FPS.
[169:50.44]This game had no FPS to begin with, so that's fine.
[169:57.61]I'm at like 5.
[169:58.25]Yeah, this is getting bad.
[169:59.95]Yeah, I'm at 17.
[170:01.36]Guys, we need to put the hubcaps on the car.
[170:03.60]Can we save and get out?
[170:07.82]I can't get out now.
[170:16.20]Oh yeah, you're right.
[170:17.10]The frame rates got real bad.
[170:18.62]Oof.
[170:23.58]Oh, I'm good.

[170:31.96]Oh my god!
[170:32.66]Who did that?
[170:33.68]Hope it was saved.

[170:41.87]I'm ready.
[170:43.61]Ow.
[170:46.67]I'm alive.
[170:47.89]Oh my god, look.

[170:55.94]Where are you, Jerma?
[170:57.54]Uh, I got killed by the door.
[170:58.48]It launched me over the diner.
[171:00.44]But I'm good.
[171:02.26]Alright, cool.
[171:03.06]As long as your corpse doesn't get stuck to the car, it's fine.
[171:05.55]Alright, we ready to hit the gas on this thing?
[171:09.53]Yes!
[171:09.81]Yes!
[171:09.93]Oh my god, look at this, look at this.
[171:11.07]Wait, wait, wait.
[171:11.97]This is like the Pootie Tang mobile.
[171:13.35]Guys, guys.
[171:14.29]Oh my god.
[171:16.51]What?
[171:18.25]Oh, you can do, like, like, the LED, um, what is it called?
[171:23.33]What?
[171:23.89]We can have under-LED lights?
[171:29.22]Underglow.
[171:30.24]Huh.
[171:35.78]We'll call it the P-Wagon.
[171:37.60]Or, like, Party Boys Wagon.
[171:40.90]I don't know if I can attach it.
[171:47.86]I'm ready to go though.
[171:49.24]Yeah.
[171:49.98]Well, there's some issue.
[171:51.58]Hold on.
[171:52.38]Yeah, move that out of the way.
[171:54.00]There's something shaking.
[171:55.42]Something?
[171:55.86]We got to get away from here.
[171:57.04]I think it's because the car is like bumping into this.
[171:58.92]Alright, I'm getting in the back.
[172:02.44]Press B, sir.
[172:04.86]I'm in.
[172:09.14]Was everybody in?
[172:09.98]Hey, can you hold that light if you're going to be out here with me?
[172:14.63]Oh, yeah.
[172:15.79]Just so it would look cool.
[172:17.20]It would, yeah.
[172:19.17]His hat.
[172:21.67]How do I take this hat off?
[172:24.19]No, the hat's good.
[172:25.03]Poke, do you want to wear one too?
[172:27.77]I have a cigarette.
[172:29.09]Alright, that's fine.
[172:30.29]You got a lightsaber back there?
[172:31.60]Alright, everybody.
[172:33.58]Oh, we can't drive.
[172:37.10]The road's closed.
[172:37.82]Alright, just be gentle, be careful, and go around.
[172:43.19]Oh, she drives smooth.
[172:44.67]Oh, what are we going to name her?
[172:47.48]Did we save before we left?
[172:49.54]Hold on, Ster stop moving.
[172:51.88]Just don't move.
[172:56.74]Game saved.
[172:57.38]We're good.
[172:58.06]Let's go.
[173:04.63]Purple Rain?
[173:05.59]That's not a bad name for it.
[173:09.23]Sometimes it's hard to see past the foot.
[173:11.71]Watch out for that tumbleweed.
[173:13.28]Oh, I should get the foot in the shot too, yeah.
[173:17.42]Yeah, the foot is perfectly lined up with like the middle.
[173:20.60]This thing is so good.
[173:21.28]Fast too.
[173:24.56]How fast do you think we're going right now?
[173:25.86]70?
[173:25.88]50.
[173:27.87]That thing is smoking.
[173:38.87]PB.
[173:41.47]PB crossed.
[173:43.89]The fork has been defeated.
[173:45.59]I apologize.
[173:47.19]I can't do this.
[173:48.33]What?
[173:49.07]This foot.
[173:49.92]This foot needs to get the fuck off this car.
[173:52.88]But what if you just move it to the left a little?
[173:55.56]Nope.
[173:56.74]No.
[173:58.46]Alright, can we compromise?
[174:00.48]We'll put it on the back of the car.
[174:02.26]Yeah.
[174:02.67]I need... If I crash this car, I'm never going to hear the end of it.
[174:05.67]True.
[174:11.11]Yeah, exactly.
[174:11.99]You don't want to waste a perfectly good foot
[174:19.63]Let's listen to that thing.
[174:20.55]Listen to that thing roar.
[174:21.97]Oh, listen to it purr.
[174:22.99]Oh, it's like a woman.
[174:24.29]Like, it likes me.
[174:25.08]Like, this is the first woman who ever liked me.
[174:27.84]On the road?
[174:28.38]On the highway.
[174:29.90]Uh, no, look, look, look.
[174:31.08]We're getting a shortcut.
[174:32.38]The road, you can see up here.
[174:33.62]Looking for adventure?
[174:36.81]Get the motor running.
[174:38.49]Whatever comes my way.
[174:48.16]This is so much fun.
[174:53.07]This is like 30 times more progress than we've made all day.
[174:56.13]It is.
[174:58.75]Yeah.
[174:59.09]There's no end game here, is there?
[175:02.06]It gets really grindy, especially because it's the same boss over and over again.
[175:05.68]I'm sorry, did you say boss?
[175:09.02]Yeah, you need just higher and higher gear score, and it kind of just gets repetitive.
[175:14.47]I cannot see with the sun.
[175:16.59]The journey is the game.
[175:19.03]That's The Long Drive.
[175:20.11]It's just how far can you go?
[175:21.59]This is really no goal at all.

[177:56.85]What was that?
[178:04.90]Is there fall damage?
[178:07.58]Yeah.
[178:13.00]Is this the fuel tank from the vehicle?
[178:14.82]Uh, I don't think so.
[178:19.68]What's that noise?
[178:24.02]Oh, metal detector.
[178:26.68]I've got nothing.
[178:28.75]Guys, I'm going to put some bacon on the car.
[178:31.21]It's worth eating.
[178:32.11]Yeah, Puck, you're muted.
[178:34.69]How is it muted?
[178:36.67]I don't know.
[178:37.43]Oh, no.
[178:40.08]That's a fuel tank with 100% water.
[178:43.56]Oh, we can drink from it.
[178:49.10]You're gonna break it.
[178:49.78]Sorry.
[178:49.90]There's water here if needed.
[178:53.40]Just pee first and then you can drink water.
[178:55.08]It's just fully packed with water.
[179:13.62]But, like, why is there reverb when you go to poop?
[179:16.08]Like, we're not in a reverberous cavern.
[179:18.52]Why wouldn't there be?

[179:51.23]This car is sacking.
[179:55.36]Maybe we can play Jenga.
[179:59.52]Vin, if you were to ask me if there was something wrong with your game, I would say yes.
[180:11.15]No, it seems good.

[184:00.86]We do have a spare in the back.
[184:02.18]Yeah, if we got a spare, we're good.
[184:04.27]We have a spare, but what about the other tire?
[184:06.85]Does anyone see where that came off?
[184:10.01]It flew off over there.

[186:03.95]No, no, the astronaut movie where he was an astronaut, but he wasn't.
[186:07.35]He farted in the thing.

[186:39.38]What's happening?
[186:43.76]We're not losing speed!
[186:45.52]We didn't even lose anything.
[186:46.50]This car is awesome.
[186:49.83]Whoa, guys!
[186:51.17]Right there!
[186:51.63]To the right!
[186:52.95]To the right!
[186:54.49]Oh.
[186:55.57]Yeah.
[186:59.25]Out here, everything's a tumbleweed.
[187:03.83]Hang on.
[187:04.27]Oh, we got a big ring.
[187:06.92]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[187:14.70]I can't tell if it's in the game or not.
[187:19.28]Oh, stop it.
[187:20.42]Wait, you have one too?
[187:21.24]Oh, God.
[187:24.17]What was that?
[187:26.89]Did he just fart?
[187:30.13]Holy...
[187:34.15]This thing's full of diesel.
[187:36.48]Oh, nice.
[187:37.00]Let me get some of that.
[187:38.06]Poe, can I ask you something?
[187:39.36]I gotta ask you.
[187:40.64]Yeah.
[187:43.26]You played Call of Duty one time, and you were in lobbies, and you were doing that in lobbies.
[187:48.66]Yeah.
[187:51.14]You have a VOD that... I don't know how this happened, but... You know those things you slap on someone's wrist?
[188:00.86]You, like, coiled up and died.
[188:04.49]Uh, Poke, I had bookmarked Twitch, you know, getting to Twitch.
[188:09.05]Like, oh, you have a bookmark to go to Twitch, right?
[188:10.89]Yeah.
[188:12.01]It was, I don't know how this happened, but it stayed here and it's still this way.
[188:16.30]A VOD of your Call of Duty, like, I thought it was so funny, I took a timestamp of it and I made it a bookmark.
[188:23.28]And it's been my default way to get back to Twitch.
[188:26.52]It's a bookmark for me.
[188:28.18]And it is you doing that.
[188:29.44]Can you open it on the screen right now?
[188:32.31]I could, oh yeah, I could...
[188:35.64]Doing what in Call of Duty?
[188:36.86]What is he doing?
[188:37.82]It's this right here.
[188:38.52]I got it right here.
[188:40.20]Okay.
[188:42.58]Are you playing it on your stream?
[188:44.04]I'm not even kidding.
[188:44.88]I'm going to do it right now.
[188:49.02]Yeah, I don't know why they removed 10v10 mode.
[188:51.30]10v10 mode was the best mode.
[188:54.12]It was so fun.
[188:55.18]He's doing it right now.
[188:56.21]I literally just clicked it.
[188:58.15]Bring it back now.
[188:59.69]This is my bookmark to Twitch.
[189:01.47]Oh, I'm listening.
[189:02.13]And they really didn't give me all my DoubleXP tokens back.
[189:04.97]You have to show things on your screen because there's thousands of people watching and they can't see it.
[189:09.35]Hideout, hideout.
[189:10.49]Yeah, show it because I didn't know what day it was.
[189:13.79]You need to have a scene that shows things.
[189:15.95]I know, I know.
[189:17.33]I also need to ask you about how to make a computer, like a stream computer.
[189:21.43]Because you do that too, right?
[189:24.12]Like a dual PC?
[189:25.26]Yeah.
[189:26.98]I have a guy that can help you.
[189:28.84]Oh, yeah.
[189:29.44]Okay.
[189:30.66]Here it is.
[189:33.31]It's this right here.
[189:38.79]It's a new map.
[189:39.65]It's a new map.
[189:44.19]It's a new map.
[189:45.40]1-800-FACT-FACTS.
[189:50.48]I'm so confused.
[189:56.52]What?
[189:57.80]What?
[190:04.72]That's my bookmark to get back to Twitch.
[190:09.62]I mean, yeah.
[190:14.63]That's... Thank you.
[190:16.21]That's exciting.
[190:18.91]No, they don't get it, Jeremiah.
[190:19.91]They don't get it.
[190:20.65]They don't understand it.
[190:21.61]They don't get it because playing Call of Duty in that phase was the greatest thing of all time because I was just recording people, replaying their voices, and also I started to argument every single match because I would say...
[190:32.97]Lock in Kamala.
[190:33.92]You got this.
[190:34.54]Stay in the lines.
[190:35.42]Don't give up.
[190:37.94]Every game there was just a MAGA clan tag.
[190:41.58]Every single game.
[190:42.86]I honestly don't know why that's still... I've never changed it.
[190:46.27]That is just... I thought that you doing that was funny.
[190:49.23]So I kept it as a bookmark and that's just my way to get back to Twitch if I want to go back to twitch.tv.
[190:56.07]I don't know why.
[190:56.95]I've never changed it.
[190:57.97]Well, thank you.
[191:00.26]the best years of poke's life trolling in Call of Duty but I would record them like I would record one guy smoking weed just coughing and just replay the whole match and someone would yell at him like dude stop fucking coughing man holy shit wait are we replacing our small tires with big tires yeah we can we can let's do it
[191:32.77]Yeah, let's go.
[191:33.73]That's so good.
[191:34.35]You can also put the back tires big.
[191:43.13]You know what I mean?
[191:43.91]The back tires be big and make it- Everything.
[191:48.27]All big everything.
[191:51.55]Wait, gas tank might be- gas tank could be open.
[191:53.36]Gas tank could be open.
[191:55.84]Um, no, that's just a foot.
[191:57.44]That's just a foot.
[191:59.69]We don't have a lot of gas, though.
[192:00.89]We have 4.9 out of 76 liters.
[192:04.01]We got more gas.
[192:08.67]Low rider.
[192:11.19]He's a low rider.
[192:15.87]Wait, the cooler in this truck is this.
[192:23.90]Look at this cooler.
[192:24.64]Is that a shooting star or something?
[192:28.26]There's like a meteor.
[192:29.91]Oh, yeah.
[192:31.71]No.
[192:32.27]Wait, is that chemtrail or...?
[192:33.57]Chemtrail, missing textures.
[192:38.17]Could be anything.
[192:38.69]Same thing.
[192:41.92]Wait, what about the engine in this truck?
[192:46.90]Anybody got a light?
[192:48.22]Wait, guys, we could use a diesel engine.
[192:50.72]There's no way!
[192:53.38]If we have diesel, we could replace the engine with diesel.
[192:56.86]we really don't this thing had diesel but we kind of like dumped a lot of it into Vinny's mouth what was that noise this thing is huge oh do you guys hear that I heard like wow it wasn't me now I'm suspicious of poke because I know he can replay like audio and stuff what do you mean you got that stuff too yeah
[193:28.23]Yeah, is there anything up here?
[193:31.17]What does torque mean?
[193:33.36]Torque?
[193:34.28]Torque.
[193:35.46]Well, the car has torque.
[193:36.64]Like a spin?
[193:39.64]No?
[193:39.94]Power?
[193:43.78]Wait a minute.
[193:44.99]What is this thing?
[193:45.81]Hello?
[193:48.25]Here we go.
[193:49.45]Hello?
[193:50.03]Nope.
[193:51.07]Are we ready to go?
[193:51.87]I want to drive the big wheels.
[193:54.69]What is this?
[193:55.21]I'm going to be the lookout.
[193:56.45]I have binoculars.
[193:58.02]I have an extra light for us.
[193:59.10]Should I attach it, like, right here?
[194:08.04]Yeah.
[194:09.84]Poke.
[194:11.54]What?
[194:12.46]This is funny.
[194:15.32]Things were... Most things were just falling off the hood.
[194:18.59]I don't know if you had... Ah, well.
[194:20.87]Are we able to create... Like, can we put the seats in the back, in the trunk, like, higher?
[194:27.88]Can we build a tower?
[194:31.64]I don't know.
[194:33.34]I'm curious.
[194:34.21]We could build a lookout.
[194:36.45]Crow's Nest.
[194:37.21]Yeah, Crow's Nest.
[194:38.23]We'll be like road pirates.
[194:39.43]Put it on top of the car and climb it up.
[194:42.37]Oh my god, dude.
[194:46.35]Alright, we're ready to roll.
[194:48.89]Alright, save.
[194:53.45]I don't want to lose the big wheel.
[194:55.81]Save.
[195:03.60]I'm missing the speedometer.
[195:08.37]What do you know about that?
[195:09.15]I heard a little giggle.
[195:12.45]Does somebody take it?
[195:13.01]I think so.
[195:16.69]Are these wheels working out?
[195:18.89]We should go as fast as you want to go.
[195:21.51]Did that scare you?
[195:25.96]No, I'm used to that.
[195:29.38]Oh, you're looking at me.
[195:30.48]Binoculars are gone.
[195:35.26]Every time I tried to hold the binoculars while it was driving, they, like... Wait, where's the dog?
[195:40.21]That's probably where my magazine went.
[195:43.17]Oh, we lost tires.
[195:46.29]We lost a lot of shit.
[195:49.56]It does not turn as easily.
[195:51.78]It does not turn very well.
[195:53.04]We lost two tires.
[195:54.08]Can we load it?
[195:55.48]I can load it.
[195:56.38]Just load it.
[196:00.71]Wait, where is it?
[196:03.32]Wait, the tires are right here.
[196:04.20]Oh, it's down here.
[196:04.72]Let's go.
[196:06.72]Yeah, we lost the bumpers on the tires.
[196:08.12]Are we really going to load?
[196:08.86]We're right here.
[196:09.82]You want to do it?
[196:10.56]We don't have to load?
[196:11.08]Right here, yeah.
[196:11.90]Oh, we're good.
[196:12.34]We're good.
[196:12.64]Oh, wait.
[196:14.44]Do you want to get the old tires back?
[196:15.48]No, no, no.
[196:17.36]Those things are so huge.
[196:18.42]Those things are ridiculous.
[196:19.34]Hey, guys.
[196:20.10]I will just be aware that I can't turn anymore.
[196:26.05]Wouldn't the two front tires be small, be faster, or no?
[196:30.82]I don't know how that works.
[196:32.74]Oh, I see.
[196:33.10]You mean like we have a little bit of the rear wheel drive and the small tires in the front?
[196:37.88]Yeah.
[196:39.15]That might be a good idea.
[196:42.09]Too late.
[196:42.59]Let's go.
[196:42.99]Okay, let's go.
[196:44.93]Sit it down.
[196:47.35]We get a... Are you okay?
[196:53.21]Is it supposed to be flying?
[196:54.34]No.
[196:57.10]No?
[197:00.30]Are we flying on your screen?
[197:01.70]Yeah, the lag is happening again for me at least.
[197:05.18]Yeah.
[197:06.54]We'll see.
[197:07.04]We'll see.
[197:07.39]We'll give it a shot.
[197:08.31]I'm going to try and... I have a really big truck and I'm going to try and drive like I'm real small.
[197:13.03]Wait, what if you just save and reload it?
[197:17.13]Like save and reload right now?
[197:20.43]Oh.
[197:22.40]Good recovery.
[197:31.89]The dog is gone, by the way.
[197:34.74]This car's gonna take my turn.
[197:37.64]Vinny, your face just scraped on the ground for at least a full second.
[197:42.44]I think we're a little top-heavy with these tall-ass fucking people in the back.
[197:47.55]Press... Yo, go third person with C and just scroll out.
[197:50.13]And don't stop scrolling.
[197:57.00]very cinematic yeah yeah dude hold um when you do that press first of all press m oh no oh no and then if you hold c the camera just like stays in place oh yeah I forgot about that cool we're fine this thing okay seriously put your head into the ground and tip us back over it kind of just happens without me doing anything well your head is kind of
[198:24.22]tweaking around I'm like preventing us from serious damage with this cone I I'm seeing that yeah it's helpful I'm telling you dude just missed a rock that was good however whenever I turn that way you really are like the car is leaning left I wonder if we like make the car
[198:49.10]Tilt more.
[198:49.74]Do you think that adds extra physics or is these wheels just tilted?
[198:53.76]It really is.
[198:54.80]I think it does.
[198:55.74]I actually wouldn't be surprised if this game has that.
[198:59.68]It's different when I turn the other way.
[199:02.00]Can you feel me on this right side?
[199:06.17]Should we counterweight stuff?
[199:07.31]Should we balance the car?
[199:09.31]Nah.
[199:09.61]Here, I'm going to go that way.
[199:11.05]You should go more left.
[199:11.87]See?
[199:12.45]Oh, see?
[199:13.13]Huh.
[199:16.15]It's really ready to roll left.
[199:17.77]Yeah, you go like that.
[199:18.69]I think it's the pine cones.
[199:20.95]I think it's the pine cones.
[199:27.38]I think this is balanced now.
[199:29.32]Right here.
[199:30.54]Uh-oh.
[199:32.40]Yeah, we're good now, dogs.
[199:34.30]Wait, where are we going?
[199:35.62]We follow the lights.
[199:39.00]You're kind of making me want to roll it.
[199:44.06]Should I roll it?
[199:48.31]I don't think you should.
[199:49.29]It's completely quiet.
[199:51.45]I'll roll it.
[199:52.09]Is that weed?
[199:56.25]I don't know.
[199:57.13]Can you even... Can you roll it?
[199:58.37]I feel like something is preventing it from happening every time.
[200:02.71]Oh no, I fell in the car.
[200:05.25]Oh crap.
[200:05.85]Wait, I can fly.
[200:06.39]Come on.
[200:07.67]Yo.
[200:07.93]That's cheating.
[200:09.17]Yo.
[200:10.10]That was lag.
[200:14.82]It was decent.
[200:15.22]This is crazy what we're seeing here.
[200:16.42]I'm good to go.
[200:22.58]I'm rolling it.
[200:23.14]Baby, please.
[200:27.76]Drive my car.
[200:30.97]Now, we gotta hit a jump.
[200:31.81]We gotta, sir, you gotta hit a huge jump somewhere.
[200:35.17]I haven't seen any jumps.
[200:36.19]There's a house up here.
[200:39.23]I see a house.
[200:44.47]Does it look like the background is electrocuted?
[200:46.52]Electrified?
[200:47.06]It does, yeah.
[200:48.24]Okay.
[200:52.55]Hey, perfect.
[200:54.23]Why is there a couch on the roof of this house?
[200:58.12]Yeah, there is.
[200:58.62]Did it spawn up there?
[201:01.88]Huh.
[201:05.48]What color paint is this?
[201:06.22]I might die.
[201:07.12]Green?
[201:07.70]Oh, never mind.
[201:10.67]If you have a weapon, you can break these boxes.
[201:13.47]I do have a weapon.
[201:16.27]There's a new coolant here, 83 water, 17 oil.
[201:21.68]That was scary.
[201:22.98]What is that, meat?
[201:25.22]No.
[201:29.29]No, it's like a spray bottle.
[201:33.45]Look at the label on the spray bottle.
[201:40.24]What are you doing?
[201:43.90]Did Jerma die?
[201:45.50]He just killed me with a katana.
[201:46.60]He just smashed me in the head with it.
[201:48.42]I didn't know you could kill people.
[201:50.18]Oh, it says jizz.
[201:51.78]Yeah.
[201:56.32]I didn't know.
[201:58.49]I was limit testing.
[202:02.07]Ow!
[202:02.15]I'm sorry.
[202:03.55]Oh, that got you?
[202:04.41]Shit.
[202:07.45]Sorry.
[202:12.83]You know, or maybe there aren't many people who have phones do you guys have phones?
[202:18.46]Please call us or write us a letter.
[202:20.52]Somehow the post office seems to be working pretty nicely Anyways, what is with today's rock music Herman?
[202:28.18]Did you die for real?
[202:29.64]I'm alive.
[202:30.22]I'm just vibing bigger beards bigger mustaches now.
[202:34.56]They seem to be I always hated the
[202:38.87]The eyes popping out of head thing.
[202:41.77]People do.
[202:43.55]You know what I'm talking about?
[202:44.25]Oh, you ever see that one guy?
[202:45.93]You're thinking of that one guy.
[202:47.39]That one guy going up.
[202:48.79]That one guy going up.
[202:49.51]Like several inches that would protrude.
[202:51.87]Yeah.
[202:52.01]I hate it.
[202:54.86]Oh, you mean like in real life, people like popping their eyes out?
[202:57.96]Yes.
[202:58.56]Yes.
[202:58.86]It's that one thing that I hate that one thing.
[203:01.64]There's a couple people that do that.
[203:05.02]Nowadays I see more, but growing up it was just that one guy.
[203:08.02]I feel like it would feel kind of good, like stretching out like your ocular or something.
[203:15.72]Yeah, but what if like... I don't know.
[203:18.67]Would it?
[203:21.39]It is like, it is... Oh my god.
[203:23.71]My mom always told me you cross your eyes too much, it would stay like that, you know?
[203:27.37]True.
[203:31.64]Uh-oh.
[203:32.24]Oh, God.
[203:33.16]The fucking... The stool fell off.
[203:37.56]I saw Summit do it one time.
[203:38.83]No way Summit did that.
[203:43.73]That just made me laugh.
[203:45.59]Jerma, I think we may need to save, reload.
[203:47.59]The car is hovering, like, badly for me.
[203:50.43]Save, reload.
[203:51.11]I'll do it.
[203:51.49]Ready?
[203:52.70]Yeah.
[203:53.32]Save.
[203:54.30]Load.
[204:01.99]Did that just make it worse?
[204:03.79]I think I'm dead.
[204:07.13]I'm not sure, but I think I'm a dead person.
[204:10.03]There were two of you in the car.
[204:11.59]Oh no!
[204:12.69]I don't think that actually helped, no.
[204:15.42]I've got you, fuck, I'm holding you.
[204:19.72]Okay, kinda... Kinda better now.
[204:22.40]Let the wind catch him, let the wind catch him!
[204:25.62]He's stuck here.
[204:28.78]The car looks actually really cool from far.
[204:32.99]Your hand was in the way?
[204:34.29]Oh.
[204:35.39]Um... We lost one of the stools.
[204:38.31]Thermal was holding the stool mid-reload and save.
[204:45.45]That might have been me.
[204:47.31]Oh.
[204:47.81]Yeah, no, I think that... Oh, I found it.
[204:49.09]I found it.
[204:49.55]That might be why everything popped.
[204:52.61]I'm green.
[204:53.15]Remember, Star.
[204:53.77]I'm green.
[204:55.43]Who are you?
[204:55.87]I can't get you out of the car.
[204:57.55]Green.
[204:58.65]There we go.
[204:59.25]Okay.
[205:05.84]Do you want to bury old Poke?
[205:10.10]We should have a service for him, yeah.
[205:11.64]Am I bugged?
[205:14.34]I think I'm going to rejoin in one second.
[205:23.27]How do I attach this?
[205:27.18]Wait, I don't see the server.
[205:29.88]Is the server not up?
[205:31.34]Maybe I have to put something in it.
[205:41.02]Not another spaghetti person.
[205:42.48]Oh, no.
[205:43.98]Oh, if you just leave the server... Oh, wait, never mind.
[205:46.12]Oh, no, it's rolling away.
[205:47.26]Oh, boy.
[205:50.56]Oh, no.
[205:51.06]Oh, God.
[205:51.86]Oh, God, he's stuck to the car.
[205:53.51]Oh, no.
[205:54.01]No!
[205:56.75]Wait.
[205:57.55]I got him.
[206:02.22]Hold on.
[206:03.86]Two FPS.
[206:08.20]I left them rejoined.
[206:08.94]I have like 35 now.
[206:11.16]Oh, that's good.
[206:11.70]Yeah, I have a lot more now from just Jerma reload.
[206:26.17]I took a bite out of that one time and I'm ashamed that I did it.
[206:29.01]I thought it was a fucking piece of food.
[206:30.41]I ate a whole one.
[206:32.69]Like, multiple times.
[206:37.20]Alright, I guess I'm driving.
[206:44.38]What the?
[206:49.54]Oh no, look behind us!
[206:51.24]What?
[206:51.76]There's a battleship!
[206:52.96]There's a battleship!
[206:55.64]coming out of the ground oh no ship you don't see it no I do we're still attached to poke's body and it's pulling well let's good let's just drag it let's go what's the worst that could happen oh god it's not it's still there yeah maybe it'll give up eventually what
[207:26.44]Oh God, we are massively de-synced.
[207:31.10]I think we are, yeah.
[207:32.14]Would we have more fun if it wasn't having any issues?
[207:35.35]No.
[207:36.35]I don't think so.
[207:37.73]I think it's just we're having the exact amount of fun we would be having.
[207:40.61]It's like the perfect amount of broken and it works.
[207:43.79]Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[207:44.63]This is like one of the... This is great.
[207:46.93]This is a great time.
[207:48.01]Yeah.
[207:51.45]Like the fact it's working... It's very jovial.
[207:53.01]When it works, it is the fun part.
[207:59.20]Alright.
[207:59.42]I think I'm just going to keep going.
[208:00.40]Wait, what's that?
[208:00.84]Is that something right there?
[208:02.40]What is over there?
[208:06.48]Um, God, I wish my binoculars were still with me.
[208:11.30]Uh, I don't see anything.
[208:13.60]Road is to the right.
[208:15.72]Oh, oh, we're good.
[208:18.47]No, Vinny, you saved it.
[208:21.07]Nope.
[208:21.35]I'm not doing much, but I'm happy to be here.
[208:25.57]We don't have that much gas left.
[208:30.08]Just saying.
[208:31.64]We really need some gas.
[208:34.30]Is there gas in the car?
[208:36.70]I put all of the gas in.
[208:39.96]We don't have a lot.
[208:44.91]Where's the road?
[208:45.41]I was going to take a shortcut, but there's nothing over there.
[208:51.74]uh go max speed and just hit the sleep button we have a lot of gas what's chat what's the likelihood we'll see a ufo if we drive at night is it a good likelihood or very minimal alright here's the road you want to go left yeah have you guys seen that schedule one game
[209:19.99]I just downloaded the demo.
[209:22.53]Is it good?
[209:23.79]Yeah, it's really good.
[209:25.29]Is it funny?
[209:26.33]Like, fun, funny, stream funny?
[209:29.25]Yeah, I think it's fun.
[209:31.10]It's like Stardew.
[209:33.58]But weed.
[209:34.68]Yeah.
[209:35.60]Well, lots of, not just weed.
[209:37.42]Yeah, okay.
[209:40.14]Drug game.
[209:40.70]Alright, looking for a UFO.
[209:46.55]Mmm!
[209:47.95]Mmm!
[209:51.99]Apparently there's a UFO event, but it doesn't happen in multiplayer, so maybe never mind.
[209:57.05]I saw a UFO earlier, but they didn't see it.
[209:59.41]So I think when you see it, it's your game.
[210:01.83]I saw one real distant.
[210:05.05]What the hell was that sound?
[210:05.87]Was that the tires?
[210:08.30]Yeah.
[210:08.58]I don't see anything crazy.
[210:16.76]This car doesn't have any mirrors.
[210:21.07]oh is it a mirror did you turn the mirror that way I think they all flew off oh either we never had them or they all flew off you use mirrors when you drive that's how you do it called driving nowadays it's cameras uh
[210:52.83]Holy shit, the moon is huge.
[210:55.95]The moon is huge.
[210:58.22]Wait.
[211:00.38]Ah, we lost the tire.
[211:02.74]Oh.
[211:07.98]No, we didn't.
[211:08.54]Oh, yeah, we did.
[211:09.32]Oh, no.
[211:09.88]Is it right?
[211:10.28]It'll be right here somewhere.
[211:11.29]Do you want me to stay at night or do you want to make it easier to find it?
[211:17.85]Go to bed.
[211:20.09]I don't see the tire.
[211:23.12]Someone in my chat said, did you know Poke is a musician also?
[211:25.55]I don't think I knew that.
[211:28.27]Is that true, Poke?
[211:30.27]Maybe.
[211:30.57]I make music, yeah.
[211:31.75]That's cool.
[211:33.45]Oh, wait, no, we talked about it a little bit.
[211:34.95]I don't think it was in-depth conversation.
[211:36.42]Not like you, though.
[211:37.22]I've watched your live shows.
[211:38.26]It's just crazy cool.
[211:40.90]Wait, what?
[211:41.86]I watch videos of your shows.
[211:43.86]Oh, man, that's embarrassing.
[211:45.08]Vinny's cool as fuck.
[211:47.60]Both of you are doing that to each other right now.
[211:49.85]Oh, yeah, no, like I do something.
[211:50.97]Not like you.
[211:51.55]Yeah, no, don't watch mine.
[211:54.15]Ster, why don't you make something music?
[211:56.17]DJ Ster?
[211:58.09]Something music.
[211:59.01]Yeah, DJ Ster.
[212:00.07]Let's go.
[212:00.67]I got an old school DJ Ster.
[212:02.39]Wait, really?
[212:04.70]I do.
[212:05.54]I do have a very old video.
[212:07.52]Oh, man.
[212:08.34]Tell us about it.
[212:09.46]What did you do?
[212:10.70]It's about buying Team Fortress 2 crates, of course.
[212:15.96]But you made like a mix on it?
[212:18.35]I feature in that song.
[212:19.15]What does that have to do with music?
[212:20.67]I feature in that song.
[212:24.67]Oh, you made a song?
[212:25.99]Yeah.
[212:27.22]Oh, shit.
[212:28.06]Am I the only one looking for the tire?
[212:33.52]Yeah.
[212:33.62]Let me try my hand at this.
[212:36.36]No, with science, we can balance this out.
[212:38.02]Hold on.
[212:40.58]Wait.
[212:42.78]Handbrake, handbrake, handbrake.
[212:45.43]Okay.
[212:50.71]Exit.
[212:53.67]There you go.
[212:54.69]Exit.
[212:56.05]Oh, you got it.
[212:56.67]Cool.
[212:58.63]Okay, now we just got to drive to a place and find a tire.
[213:00.68]Vinny flew away.
[213:01.48]I'm looking for a tire.
[213:04.48]Yeah, we need another tire.
[213:05.22]We have it.
[213:05.68]We have it.
[213:06.16]We have it.
[213:06.58]If you go too far, we're going to explode.
[213:09.81]We don't.
[213:12.79]Oh, wait.
[213:13.89]We are still missing one.
[213:15.21]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[213:15.93]We're trying to balance it.
[213:18.05]Yeah, no, we can drive without it.
[213:19.19]Let's go.
[213:19.55]I mean, it's part of the journey.
[213:20.79]We got to, yeah, get there.
[213:25.86]Part of the journey.
[213:27.52]Wait, DJ, Ster strongbox crate remix.
[213:32.22]Please, God, both of you can't be like, it's embarrassing that I do like official live shows and practice with a band, but you'll watch like these crates on stream.
[213:41.14]I'll watch it.
[213:41.66]Hell yeah.
[213:42.24]Don't.
[213:42.64]Don't do it.
[213:43.38]Do not.
[213:43.92]Do not.
[213:46.34]I'm going to after we're done.
[213:48.18]Oh, yeah.
[213:52.48]I forgot that you were in it.
[213:54.66]Yeah.
[213:56.19]I can't watch past the first three seconds, so I would have forgotten because you're in at the end.
[214:00.49]Chad, I'll ask for it later.
[214:02.89]I'll get it later after we're done.
[214:06.39]Poke, thank you, by the way.
[214:07.43]Appreciate you checking out some of my stuff.
[214:11.43]I lurk.
[214:14.53]Anyone want me to feature in any of their things?
[214:16.25]I mean, I got a pretty good chorus I could throw in there.
[214:19.87]I know what it is.
[214:21.49]I'll let you know.
[214:22.88]Yeah.
[214:26.02]If you want me to do Jerma's chorus, we'll both do the same one.
[214:29.08]What do you mean?
[214:32.20]Oh, we don't give a fuck.
[214:33.58]We don't give a fuck.
[214:34.54]We don't give a fuck.
[214:35.76]We don't give a fuck.
[214:36.92]We don't give a fuck.
[214:43.82]What if I write a song called We Give a Fuck?
[214:46.98]And then, like, can you, like, still do that?
[214:49.95]Can you still, like, make that work?
[214:53.59]Give me some vocals and I'll put in a song.
[214:56.67]Jeremy, give me some vocals at 130 BPM.
[215:00.37]What is that?
[215:04.57]We don't give a fuck.
[215:05.47]We don't give a fuck.
[215:06.37]We don't give a fuck.
[215:07.27]We don't give a fuck.
[215:08.15]We don't give a fuck.
[215:08.83]I think we're not moving.
[215:10.93]The recording just has the car...
[215:15.92]All we have to do is just get there Alright, well I guess I'm dead
[215:41.66]You shot a cannon out of the back of the fucking car.
[215:44.42]We got a gas station right up here or something.
[215:46.48]I can't even get out of the car.
[215:52.43]Here, you guys drive.
[215:53.97]I'll see you there.
[215:56.45]Wait, I can sit in the middle of the front.
[215:57.91]What the hell?
[216:00.40]Hey.
[216:01.98]They left the door behind?
[216:03.08]Really?
[216:03.54]I'll go get it.
[216:07.42]We don't need a door.
[216:09.08]We'll find a door.
[216:10.58]Why are we not driving?
[216:13.00]We're driving.
[216:13.48]Kill him!
[216:13.66]I'm trying!
[216:32.54]I'll be gone a little while, Chad.
[216:33.74]Don't worry about this.
[216:34.30]I can't hit him.
[216:35.42]We'll get there.
[216:35.94]We'll get there.
[216:37.40]You can't like GTA pull you out of the car, right?
[216:39.00]I don't think I can actually.
[216:40.72]I don't think I can fly for this one.
[216:44.25]Sir, can you hit him?
[216:46.43]I can't get out.
[216:49.01]Uh-oh.
[216:50.81]Chad, I'm kind of blacked out.
[216:51.85]Wait, I had a katana.
[216:52.91]I don't know where it went.
[216:55.11]That text on the bottom right, I thought it was an MTV music video description.
[217:04.26]I dropped him.
[217:08.15]MMBRotate is a fucking awesome band name.
[217:12.03]What the fuck, he snuck in!
[217:13.05]Guys, I got this.
[217:20.25]How do I take off my glasses?
[217:26.98]Nice job, you got it.
[217:35.83]Hey, you want these too?
[217:38.49]We got a lot of tires.
[217:44.78]I think he's dead.
[217:45.44]Yeah, you got him.
[217:49.58]Here, Vinny.
[217:51.54]Vinny, you look like every single person that went to a gaming convention when Plants vs. Zombies came out.
[218:03.99]Man.
[218:05.35]What is that?
[218:05.71]What are we talking?
[218:06.83]2008?
[218:07.71]It's like 2009.
[218:08.61]Same exact color.
[218:10.15]What?
[218:10.31]You threw away those glasses?
[218:11.77]Oh, you wore them.
[218:12.31]I'm wearing them.
[218:13.93]My screen flew away.
[218:14.53]The tire is not attaching.
[218:21.12]Let me see.
[218:23.28]There you go.
[218:34.12]I think we put the two fat tires in the back and put it this one these two small ones Because I don't think there's any more more big tires.
[218:44.19]Why does it?
[218:59.04]Or vision
[219:00.32]You good?
[219:01.48]Dude, we're like a full NASCAR team now.
[219:04.59]True pit stop.
[219:08.11]Oh, wait.
[219:09.51]No, big tyrant.
[219:10.23]I said the wrong thing.
[219:11.91]New leg just dropped.
[219:20.53]Door fell off.
[219:24.45]I think we're going to be driving into the ground.
[219:27.72]Guys, I'm in... I'm in... I have... There's a problem.
[219:31.48]What's wrong?
[219:34.20]I'm stuck on a seat in the wall.
[219:36.72]Oh, there it is.
[219:37.28]Where?
[219:38.48]I'm on the... Oh, yeah, there I am.
[219:40.00]Wait, I'm rolling.
[219:40.80]I'm rolling.
[219:42.40]What's... You guys, look at him.
[219:47.30]How did you do this?
[219:47.93]Why is his feet moving?
[219:49.43]I'm trying to... Yeah, that's weird.
[219:51.75]Turn the car off.
[219:55.11]Hey, we don't give a fuck.
[219:59.16]We don't give a fuck.
[219:59.94]We don't give a fuck.
[220:01.50]We don't give a fuck.
[220:02.32]We don't give a fuck.
[220:05.84]Can you stack it on top of the other one so we can make a crow's nest?
[220:10.28]Can I sit in the back with you guys?
[220:11.44]I feel like you guys are having fun without me.
[220:13.86]I'm having a good time back here.
[220:15.34]I really like it.
[220:15.90]I'm going to try something here.
[220:28.78]Um, hold on, I'm... I don't think that worked.
[220:32.90]It was, I mean, it was, it looked cold.
[220:36.41]I'm bringing a spear.
[220:37.39]Before I get these glasses off, one... No, we need room for us three to sit in the back.
[220:48.08]Oh, noooo.
[220:51.06]I wanna sit back here.
[220:51.94]Sit here.
[220:54.52]We need to attach it, right?
[220:56.28]Jerma, you want cool glasses or no?
[220:58.47]Yeah?
[220:59.87]I don't want them.
[221:00.89]Yeah, you can have them.
[221:04.80]Oh, I... Yeah, I don't want these.
[221:06.56]How do I get them off?
[221:08.32]That's exactly what I was thinking.
[221:10.20]No thanks, man.
[221:11.56]How do I take these off?
[221:14.00]What do you mean take them off?
[221:15.32]You never do.
[221:16.66]How do I take off the glasses?
[221:18.40]That's just how you are now.
[221:19.42]V. V.
[221:44.75]There's another AK-47 in here.
[221:46.31]I'm gonna give it to one of you guys.
[221:47.93]The one with no ammo.
[221:49.26]Anyone wants to hold it.
[221:50.04]Oh, goodness.
[221:54.22]Can somebody just kill me so I can get these glasses off?
[221:57.46]V. Press V. Or hold it.
[222:00.66]V?
[222:01.96]V. Oh, V is sleep.
[222:03.90]V for Vince Sauce.
[222:06.06]Vince Sauce.
[222:07.02]Was he happy that you raided him?
[222:08.46]Did you check out his channel?
[222:09.62]He doesn't exist.
[222:10.66]Oh.
[222:12.78]But he lives in our hearts.
[222:19.96]That's the best we can do.
[222:22.50]There's a product called Vinyl Sauce.
[222:25.62]It's just vinyl you put on your furniture for upholstery.
[222:30.37]I was like, I should buy some, and then it was like $30.
[222:31.91]I'm like, I'm good.
[222:37.27]I think we're leaving Vinny.
[222:41.03]It's fine.
[222:43.20]I'll catch up.
[222:44.62]I dropped an AK-47.
[222:45.10]It's right on the ground there.
[222:49.38]Oh no, is that a different gun?
[222:51.78]No, this is an AK-47.
[222:53.16]It's empty, but I mean, it would be nice to have a spare just in case we find more ammo.
[223:01.08]Wait, where'd the other stool go back here?
[223:02.90]Oh, it's on the roof.
[223:04.98]Now it's in a cool spot.
[223:08.55]Someone take this though, this AK-47.
[223:09.89]Uh, let me see.
[223:13.23]And just throw it in your inventory.
[223:14.55]Just like two, three, whatever.
[223:18.38]Look at your face looking at me.
[223:20.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[223:22.02]Hold on.
[223:23.18]Are you attached to there, Ster?
[223:25.62]I actually grabbed your stool.
[223:28.36]Am I what?
[223:29.19]Are you attached?
[223:30.77]Yeah.
[223:31.39]Because I grabbed your stool?
[223:33.69]Why does he look like that in the back?
[223:38.05]Yeah, what actually is wrong with him?
[223:42.62]It looks like a fake stuffed person.
[223:44.76]Did someone say grabbing stool?
[223:47.30]Like a dummy.
[223:49.16]It looks like a fucking like the Halloween, like the fall county fair, like the scarecrow.
[223:55.00]Like a bunch of hay.
[223:56.44]Shit.
[223:56.86]Alright.
[223:57.38]I'm ready.
[224:00.59]Alright, here we go.
[224:02.37]Left to right.
[224:03.17]Oh, wait.
[224:03.61]Straight.
[224:09.43]That noise.
[224:10.86]This does not sound good.
[224:19.88]The fucking scarecrow in the back.
[224:24.64]We need to find a pumpkin for this thing.
[224:39.25]Somebody got rid of the radio.
[224:40.85]Crazy.
[224:42.63]Crazy.
[224:43.65]Probably playing copyrighted stuff anyway.
[224:47.54]I'm suspicious of everything these days.
[224:49.69]I don't even listen to music.
[224:51.09]Did we just die?
[224:53.83]Our hood came off.
[224:54.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[224:56.53]Do we need a hood?
[224:56.93]The hood's right there.
[224:57.55]I think it would be nice to have the hood.
[224:59.63]It just looks cool.
[225:01.47]I'm going to be honest.
[225:02.14]I haven't been playing the game in probably like 40 straight minutes.
[225:06.02]Two hours, I feel like.
[225:09.90]I've just been sitting here laughing at shit.
[225:11.86]I'm just watching a comedy movie.
[225:20.67]Wait, wait, wait!
[225:25.67]Put it in the weirdest spot you can.
[225:30.74]I think no matter where, like, it's hard to put it somewhere that sticks, right?
[225:35.04]Yeah.
[225:35.30]I think it only sticks in, like, in the back.
[225:43.98]Oh, never mind.
[225:44.62]Oh, yeah, see?
[225:47.12]I know!
[225:47.84]God, you just ran his head over.
[225:49.86]You ran his head over.
[225:54.15]I'm stuck.
[225:59.81]Wait, I'm sleeping.
[226:00.43]Is he gonna fix it?
[226:02.17]I'm trying.
[226:04.21]I apologize.
[226:06.07]How the hell does it go on the roof?
[226:08.41]Oh, because it's curved and it goes... I think I see.
[226:11.21]Okay, I'm gonna go get my guitar.
[226:14.15]Let's go have fun.
[226:15.85]Okay, is everybody done playing?
[226:18.47]Can you roll down the window?
[226:27.44]Yeah.
[226:28.18]Yeah, you can.
[226:30.17]On this side?
[226:30.79]Yeah.
[226:32.85]You can also drink the cactus.
[226:35.11]There you go.
[226:35.55]Window's closed.
[226:36.49]Opened.
[226:44.85]Oh, I'm sorry.
[226:45.49]I gotta practice.
[226:57.10]Yep.
[226:57.24]We look like we're posing for something.
[227:00.18]Just keep thinking of the guy who filled with hay.
[227:06.38]It's.
[227:10.42]Oh.
[227:14.50]Oh, that works?
[227:15.32]Is that working?
[227:16.76]I don't think so.
[227:18.26]Oh.
[227:18.38]Let's see.
[227:20.52]It actually does work.
[227:21.26]It kind of looks like it's working.
[227:23.50]Yeah, it is working.
[227:24.06]Do you want me to just hit a wall really hard and see what happens?
[227:29.37]Yeah.
[227:30.21]Poke, just take us full speed off something or into something.
[227:32.89]I'm sniffing, Vinny.
[227:34.51]Wait, I think we should sleep.
[227:35.27]I think we should sleep.
[227:36.33]Oh, never mind.
[227:39.37]Looks like it's good.
[227:40.13]Does Jerome have to sleep?
[227:42.43]Uh, yep.
[227:46.39]Time change incoming.
[227:49.66]Trying to get in the car here.
[227:52.68]And just save it.
[227:57.08]Saved up.
[227:57.48]Alright, let's go.
[228:01.57]If you see a jump or a ledge or something just to take us off.
[228:06.27]There's no jumps.
[228:07.67]Do we have two tires, like two small tires in the back or just one?
[228:11.07]Oh, just one, OK.
[228:12.68]Chad, I lied.
[228:13.26]The big tires are screwing us over.
[228:14.34]No name is not just that one cord.
[228:16.72]These big tires are screwing us.
[228:19.12]I was I wasn't even right wrong cord.
[228:22.82]Focus the handbrake on.
[228:25.00]No.
[228:26.14]It's just those big tires.
[228:29.90]Also, if you're playing guitar, I can't hear it.
[228:31.78]No, I'm not trying.
[228:32.43]I'm not doing that for anyone's benefit, but I want to hear it.
[228:37.31]Can we get some nice?
[228:39.45]You want your van?
[228:41.25]Give us some tunes.
[228:41.99]Give us some tunes in the car.
[228:44.27]I'm just going to play Wonderwall.
[228:47.25]He really wants it.
[228:50.95]Hell yeah.
[228:52.49]No, I'm not going to do that.
[228:53.32]This is a weird road.
[229:07.52]That's a pretty big straightaway.
[229:10.70]This seat is so flat.
[229:13.35]There's no jumps or ledges or... I feel like this is probably much more like thumbnail.
[229:23.14]There's even cactus, like why is there a cactus in the car?
[229:27.96]Look, we're gonna get out of this biome.
[229:29.00]You have to believe.
[229:31.06]Yeah, I'm so sick of this desert, holy shit.
[229:35.51]These tires are really bad.
[229:39.23]Oh, because we got a small one and a couple big ones.
[229:41.65]Oh god, oh god.
[229:44.09]I just noticed.
[229:45.15]I've been, like, so checked out of the actual car maintenance aspect of this game.
[229:49.69]Yeah, me too.
[229:50.55]Like, I haven't actually been driving at all.
[229:52.17]I actually have no idea what's... That wasn't that bad, actually.
[229:57.12]Oh, nothing happened.
[229:59.50]It's just everything slowly falls off.
[230:02.42]Something... Yeah, several things fell off.
[230:04.56]The engine fell off the fucking thing.
[230:06.80]Yeah.
[230:07.14]Guys, we've been dead for fucking two hours.
[230:09.18]Like, these are four ghosts flying around trying to hurt each other still.
[230:14.98]I need to stop.
[230:15.78]I haven't eaten at all today.
[230:17.78]I had like crackers for breakfast.
[230:19.40]I had dino nuggies.
[230:23.12]Dino nuggies?
[230:25.10]That would be more.
[230:26.44]Denny's or dino nuggies?
[230:27.88]Dino nuggies.
[230:28.90]Wait, Poke, if you stand up with that thing on your head, it lifts the whole car.
[230:33.00]You're like a Jack.
[230:34.48]I'm trying.
[230:34.88]I can't move.
[230:41.06]Wait, look at the tire.
[230:41.86]How did this happen?
[230:44.02]Oh.
[230:46.66]Where's the... What is happening to the tire?
[230:57.25]It's in the back seat.
[230:58.75]Oh, it's right here.
[231:04.95]Oh, my God.
[231:05.31]Oh, God.
[231:05.69]The frame rate's... Oh, my God.
[231:10.33]This car is so hardy.
[231:11.73]It just doesn't want to die.
[231:14.05]And through it all, I like Gumby.
[231:17.66]stand tall and stoic.
[231:22.70]Alright.
[231:23.34]Wait, I have an idea.
[231:25.16]Wait, what if we did small, big, small, big?
[231:32.77]This has got to be fixed.
[231:36.11]No.
[231:37.09]I just put that in.
[231:38.83]Why'd you do that?
[231:42.45]Are you trying to make a... Oh, I see what you're doing.
[231:44.45]You're trying to make it wicked messed up.
[231:48.52]Alright, how's this gonna work?
[231:50.32]Alright, you drive.
[231:53.06]Uh, alright, I'll drive.
[231:55.62]We good?
[231:57.58]Gamer posture.
[232:04.00]Ster, if you have to go eat, dude, I think, uh, that would probably be good for you, right?
[232:10.17]Like, nutrition?
[232:11.35]Why are you trying to get rid of me?
[232:13.25]I'm really not.
[232:14.15]I just don't want you to feel obligated.
[232:15.27]Ster, your vibes have just not... Go eat, dude.
[232:18.67]I'm just taking us off the next cliff.
[232:21.25]And then we can probably call it there.
[232:23.11]There has been no cliffs!
[232:25.25]You know what's weird about... Yeah, this seed has been really weird.
[232:27.56]Because we had that one fucked up seed where it was like going like up.
[232:31.96]Like a roller coaster.
[232:33.14]And then this one has been just totally flat.
[232:34.96]Is it driving nice?
[232:41.28]It does drive great.
[232:42.21]Yeah, it's not bad.
[232:47.25]Huh.
[232:52.59]Oh, God.
[232:53.65]Uh, we lost the sausage.
[232:54.89]Sausage overboard.
[232:56.87]Oh, Vinny, I almost cut your head off.
[232:58.35]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[233:04.14]Oh, my God, dude.
[233:10.22]You on the back just, it solves everything.
[233:13.26]It does, it really does.
[233:14.08]It's really great.
[233:15.00]The car is immune to damage.
[233:17.40]I see a jump.
[233:18.82]I see a jump potential.
[233:21.70]Yeah, that's not going to work, but let's try it.
[233:24.16]What if we save?
[233:27.52]I don't know if you ever want to come back to this.
[233:28.98]Maybe one day they'll actually update the game.
[233:31.82]If they update the game, we're making a new seed.
[233:33.96]Oh yeah, good point.
[233:35.97]Good point.
[233:41.49]Alright, let's do this jump.
[233:44.67]Game was updated in November.
[233:46.31]Okay.
[233:50.45]Yeah, I'm getting cold feet.
[233:51.41]You're right.
[233:51.67]It's not going to work.
[233:53.11]They literally have this in Roblox, by the way.
[233:56.43]Like, the whole game.
[233:57.82]You guys want to do a Roblox night?
[233:59.08]Like, to do some more Roblox shenanigans?
[234:01.96]Ooh, next time Roblox?
[234:02.94]Let's do it.
[234:03.98]Pass.
[234:05.18]Vinny, you ever played Roblox?
[234:07.02]Never.
[234:07.88]Wait, Vinny, you never played Roblox?
[234:09.90]No.
[234:10.08]What?
[234:13.48]You do it if you want.
[234:14.60]I'll, you know, I might pass on that.
[234:18.42]It's actually fun.
[234:21.82]No Roblox for Vinny?
[234:23.24]You're missing out.
[234:25.67]I have my opinions.
[234:27.79]Didn't we talk about this before?
[234:29.11]I have my Roblox opinions.
[234:32.45]Wait, someone said you don't remember the Roblox drama.
[234:34.75]Wait, what happened?
[234:40.97]You had a Roblox allegations?
[234:44.59]I've never played it.
[234:45.89]Oh, okay.
[234:48.67]I'm reading our Discord messages.
[234:49.78]I'm sorry I brought it up.
[234:51.61]Oh, I don't give a shit.
[234:52.51]It's all good.
[234:53.11]It's just, yeah, it's not the most appealing.
[234:55.01]Wait, I'm actually joking.
[234:55.77]Did something actually happen?
[234:57.37]Yes.
[234:58.81]A little bit.
[234:59.63]There's a game called Brickadia, though, that's coming out that's basically LEGO Roblox, and that's kind of cool.
[235:04.80]Guys, this car doesn't work anymore.
[235:08.00]Guys.
[235:14.81]Guys.
[235:14.99]Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[235:18.31]Listen, if Roblox fucks with you, Vinny, I don't fuck with him.
[235:21.97]Alright, I'm on team Vinny.
[235:25.99]Fuck Roblox.
[235:27.37]Well, I'm not that militant about it.
[235:30.65]I kind of... It's a less appealing multiplayer stream for me.
[235:35.45]I'm not 100% no.
[235:38.52]But I just don't like Roblox the company.
[235:45.85]We can do whatever.
[235:47.73]You're trying to get yourself killed.
[235:49.75]I'm realizing that right now.
[235:55.51]I can't get out of this.
[235:56.47]I just hear myself whacking every time I come by.
[235:59.84]You look like a monster just trying to kill us.
[236:02.04]This is like an event.
[236:04.82]Alright, I think we got what we looked for out of this one.
[236:10.64]What happens when I fly really far away from you guys?
[236:14.58]Yeah, try to just smash into it really hard.
[236:17.32]Let's just try to break the whole seed now.
[236:18.74]Let's just, like, what do we do?
[236:20.42]I'm just looking for a biome that isn't desert.
[236:23.08]If you hold shift while no-clipping, it just, it's so fast.
[236:28.92]It's really fast, but this world map is fucking massive.
[236:34.17]Wait, where the hell is the other biomes?
[236:35.61]Where the hell are we?
[236:36.79]I don't think this is an endless... I think it just includes desert forever.
[236:39.97]I think you can make a different map.
[236:44.51]I found a spooky haunted house with a with the cemetery like really really far away but not much else it's the same dudes too
[237:02.74]Alright, gamers.
[237:03.24]I'm crashing out!
[237:04.44]That was... Alright.
[237:06.66]I'm crashing out!
[237:07.96]Just rip all the shit off the fucking car.
[237:09.88]I finally found something really cool.
[237:12.16]It's a rusty ship, and you can't even... There's nothing in it.
[237:15.76]Never mind, it sucks.
[237:16.50]There is.
[237:16.90]There's oil barrels in the bottom.
[237:19.23]Oh.
[237:19.79]I'm crashing out.
[237:20.67]I gotta go.
[237:21.15]Alright.
[237:21.85]Ster.
[237:22.71]Thanks.
[237:24.23]Bye, Ster.
[237:24.75]Love you, man.
[237:25.59]Have fun.
[237:26.89]See you later.
[237:29.19]This was so much fucking fun.
[237:30.99]My whole body hurts from laughing at this.
[237:33.61]I enjoyed the fuck out of this.
[237:35.31]Thank you for even bringing my attention to this nonsense.
[237:39.41]I loved it.
[237:41.30]When you mentioned long drive, I actually was a doubter.
[237:43.36]I was like, wait, I've played this game enough.
[237:45.48]I know it's not going to work, but that was fun.
[237:49.42]This was dope.
[237:50.12]Thank you.
[237:51.69]Always good to play with you guys, too.
[237:53.79]I know Ster's gone, but I enjoy gaming with you guys a lot.
[237:57.79]Thank you for always doing cool stuff.
[238:00.76]Fun.
[238:01.34]Yeah, you guys are awesome.
[238:02.22]Good shit.
[238:03.00]We'll do it again.
[238:04.28]Next week, what do we want to play?
[238:06.55]I mean, we'll figure it out.
[238:07.79]Maybe we'll just surprise them next week and just... Yeah, we got some ideas.
[238:11.67]We'll come up with something.
[238:12.71]We'll talk about it.
[238:13.51]We're talking about Warcraft 3 potential.
[238:16.06]We talked about VR potential.
[238:17.74]We talked about... Men in Conquer.
[238:18.98]Men in Conquer.
[238:19.88]There's some good shit.
[238:22.28]Yep.
[238:23.76]Alrighty.
[238:24.12]I'm gonna go.
[238:24.99]Alright.
[238:26.93]Bye, guys.
[238:27.57]Take it easy, guys.
[238:28.17]Bye.
[238:29.27]Bye, bye.
[238:32.67]Oh my goodness.
[238:33.27]That was fucking so funny.
[238:36.83]I think so much shit was happening in the first like two or three hours.
[238:39.11]I think we all like ran out of gas.
[238:42.91]God, that was fucking funny.
[238:49.72]Yeah, I probably won't be live for a few days.
[238:53.80]I've got some IRL stuff I need to do.
[239:04.48]The bets were really fun.
[239:05.32]We literally just bet... Will they reach one more building?
[239:09.28]That's fucking... Yeah, that's a good bet to do because who... That could be 50-50, honestly.
[239:22.35]I showed my bookmark on stream two.
[239:26.56]It's so funny.
[239:27.04]Like I saw that one like 10 second clip and I was like, oh, this is really funny.
[239:30.32]I'm going to bookmark this.
[239:32.30]And then I just stayed as my bookmark to Twitch.
[239:38.23]First story.
[239:41.67]We got a lot of shit out of this.
[239:42.67]This is a good stream.
[239:43.57]I had a lot of fun.
[239:55.81]But yeah, have a good one, guys.
[239:57.37]Take care of yourselves.
[239:59.37]See you soon.
[240:01.51]Probably what's today?
[240:02.23]What's today's date is?
[240:03.25]26.
[240:11.18]Maybe like Saturday.
[240:14.00]Saturday or Sunday, 29th or 30th.
[240:15.42]I think that makes sense.
[240:29.11]Is anybody there still streaming?
[240:30.25]Is Poke still going or Vinny still going or anybody?
[240:45.28]Vinny's ending.
[240:46.80]Poke's still going.
[240:49.22]Have we ever even raided Poke?
[240:50.40]I feel like we've never raided Poke before.
[240:52.07]Maybe once.
[240:52.75]Let's go raid Poke.
[240:54.15]He's still going.
[241:03.58]That was a fun one.
[241:05.70]Thanks for hanging out.
[241:06.40]That actually went longer than I thought.
[241:07.50]I thought we were only going to be... I thought we were only going to get maybe like an hour or two out of that.
[241:21.73]Let's raid poke.
[241:26.06]Did it go through?
[241:30.00]Oh, hold on.
[241:30.28]I need to do this.
[241:31.50]Let me exit this game.
[241:37.02]Let me go like this.
[241:43.15]I closed my dashboard when I showed that last thing I just did.
[241:57.84]There, we have one more second.
[242:04.37]And hold on.
[242:11.07]Gotta click a million buttons.
[242:12.41]There we go.
[242:12.75]Gotta click a million buttons.
[242:15.41]There we go.
[242:15.91]I can hear myself.
[242:16.59]Gotta click a million buttons.
[242:18.39]There we go.
[242:18.89]I can hear myself.
[242:19.57]I can hear myself.
[242:29.84]This was a Joker stream, man.
[242:32.28]This was just like... My head hurts.
[242:36.23]Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[242:36.91]Have fun.
[242:38.25]Go say it about Behave.
[242:41.08]And we'll see you on Saturday or Sunday.
[242:43.93]Have a good night.
[242:44.37]Call your mother.
[242:44.87]See you later.
[242:47.15]Goodbye.
[242:47.69]See you later.
