[00:00.80]Listen, that's not a defeat for me.
[00:03.04]Listen, I will be fucking doing cartwheels in my fucking apartment knowing that you're not as smart as me when I do the fucking bomb game with you.
[00:09.94]Alright, when do you want to do it?
[00:12.36]When do you want to do it?
[00:16.71]Whenever you're ready.
[00:17.43]Well, not today, that is.
[00:19.05]Next week?
[00:20.39]Yeah, I'm down to clown.
[00:22.25]At some point next week?
[00:23.01]You want to keep talking and nobody explodes?
[00:24.93]Not Halo?
[00:26.29]Not Halo...
[00:30.99]I think I'm never going to fucking ever play Halo because of you.
[00:34.17]Why is this my fault?
[00:34.95]I didn't do anything.
[00:36.45]What did I do?
[00:39.97]Because of you.
[00:41.05]Because of you.
[00:43.11]Oh, my God.
[00:45.15]Did I ruin Halo for you?
[00:46.45]I wasn't the one calling me at like 2 a.m.
[00:48.82]saying, hey, gamer, listen, I've been thinking a lot.
[00:54.36]And you know what would be pretty fucking...
[00:56.97]pretty fucking hella gamer.
[00:58.87]Halo and legendary.
[00:59.97]And I told them, guys, this is true facts.
[01:02.63]This is not me making this bullshit up.
[01:04.95]I told Jerma, first of all, I don't really play that much Halo.
[01:10.76]And you kept lying to me for weeks upon end saying, you know, back in the day, Halo was my jam.
[01:17.28]This is verbatim, by the way.
[01:19.64]Jerma threateningly recommended Halo to me.
[01:27.85]And I said, maybe, maybe, and then we get around to doing it and you've been doing nothing but insulting me
[01:34.38]and saying mean things to me my favorite part about this whole two hour broadcast so far absolutely is it going to make me laugh for the next probably three straight days is that you didn't want to even do like a Halo at all and we're like let's do Halo, Halo Legendary and you're just sitting there going I fucking don't want to be here that's so fucking funny
[02:02.39]Okay.
[02:02.67]Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:03.98]I'll tell you the analogy here, right?
[02:06.12]It's a little story, right?
[02:07.12]I'm going to open up a medieval while we talk.
[02:10.38]Okay.
[02:11.24]Imagine paddling around with friends.
[02:14.32]You really like these friends, right?
[02:17.87]And you think they're funny, they're great.
[02:20.69]And then you follow them underneath the bridge.
[02:24.29]And they all pull out syringes.
[02:26.91]And then they stab themselves in the genitals with syringes.
[02:32.57]And you like these friends, but you don't like what they're doing.
[02:37.04]But you keep going on with it.
[02:38.62]And then you stab yourself with the syringe.
[02:40.84]And you smile through your teeth and say, yeah, I like this.
[02:44.88]And you don't know if they're enjoying it, so you're just kind of going along with it.
[02:50.12]Now, at this point, I'm bleeding out of my cock, so... So I'm saying, no more Halo, not tonight, maybe at some point.
[03:03.37]Next time we're doing this, we're not fucking playing a game we're unfamiliar with, and we're not putting it on the hardest difficulty.
[03:13.64]alright how about how about keep talking and nobody explodes uh next week yes I think that sounds like a great idea I I'm quickly learning something alright let's see we don't interact too much on stream we wrestle sometime you know but I don't think FPS games and us it's like orange juice and toothpaste we need
[03:39.37]logical games we need we need big brain games we need games for big boys alright where's my save this is it we need games like portal math games I'll take a math game you good at math uh not at all like as as zero as you could be at math
[04:04.95]What about the Pogo game?
[04:05.89]Oh yeah, that's right, we never did the Pogo game.
[04:08.03]Never did the Pogo game.
[04:11.37]Have you played Avid Evil?
[04:12.13]Have you played Dusk?
[04:12.77]Oh yeah, I've played Avid Evil.
[04:16.03]They're very good.
[04:19.31]What's your favorite video game?
[04:23.21]Uh, say that one more time?

[05:15.65]Alright, I gotta get that.

[05:20.50]Uh...
[05:23.54]Shenmue and Pok√©mon, I think.
[05:24.90]Yeah.
[05:26.32]Did we just play co-op Halo and then both just go to different games and play different things and do different streams in the same cult?
[05:38.45]That's fucking hilarious.
[05:43.41]Oh, that's awesome.
[05:47.63]Ow.
[05:47.87]That's what being a gamer is all about.
[05:49.13]You improvise.
[05:50.90]And you learn that you hate fucking video games.
[05:57.05]Well, I like video games.
[05:58.73]If they're brain related.
[06:00.21]And they're good.
[06:06.19]What time is it?

[06:18.76]Oh my goodness, that's so late.

[06:25.26]No, I'm just pulling your face.

[06:35.11]When do you usually start streaming?
[06:37.25]What fucking... But I'm not like...
[06:42.50]intimidating to play Halo at fucking 4 in the morning.
[06:47.82]Why do I have to be the bad guy?
[06:50.48]Because you were the one who was like, okay, verbatim, I'm going to read this.
[06:54.80]I'm going to read this right now.
[06:56.62]This is horseshit.

[08:06.94]Is someone on Discord right now?
[08:11.08]Did you guys hear someone on Discord?
[08:13.82]It's the sound of a coward.
[08:18.64]Hold on.
[08:19.44]Telling me I'm a coward and you were saying you didn't want to play Halo on Legendary difficulty?
[08:24.32]Somehow I've turned into the coward?
[08:25.74]I only really speak the game around these parts.
[08:31.17]If you guys know anyone who would like to come forward and admit...
[08:36.51]How much non-gamer they are.
[08:41.45]What's your favorite non-gaming activity?
[08:43.71]I'm just saying... I'm just saying that... If you wanna play with the big boys... You gotta step up.
[08:52.60]Uh oh, somebody said Jerma and Joel no longer friends.
[08:55.38]Oh fuck.
[08:56.98]Uh oh.
[09:01.90]That means we have to settle this in the fucking ring.
[09:09.92]I hope you know that you're gonna be... I'm not going down that fucking road again.
[09:14.19]I'm not going down that fucking road again.

[09:37.58]Hello?
[09:37.94]Did he leave?
[09:40.22]I like that someone in chat just said, friendship with Jerma over.
[09:43.52]You guys just don't, we're just rashing each other.
[09:53.22]He started it.
[09:56.72]Did you guys see what he said to me on stream?
[09:59.69]No, no, no.
[10:00.33]I got my hand over the panic button.
[10:06.55]Do you guys remember all the awful things he said to me?
[10:10.76]Do you remember when he said all those nasty things to me?
[10:14.48]When?
[10:14.96]Where?
[10:16.40]I've never said a nasty thing in my life.
[10:18.16]You said so many bad things about me and my family.
[10:23.49]You know?
[10:24.15]Cover his mic.
[10:27.89]Like we're in the same room.
[10:28.83]Like, no, I'm going to cover.
[10:29.71]Why do we have two mics?
[10:31.05]I don't know.
[10:32.19]Can you reach?
[10:43.38]How tall are you?
[10:44.72]May I ask?
[10:45.50]I think it's time to end this call, Jeremiah.
[10:48.12]How tall are you?
[10:49.68]How tall are you?
[10:51.57]Five, what?
[10:52.49]How tall are you?
[10:56.05]Five, what are you?
[10:56.93]Five, what are you?
[10:57.77]Five, nine.
[10:58.33]Jeremiah, have you ever gone on a roller coaster?
[11:02.32]Yeah, I love them.
[11:02.68]How do you feel when you go on a roller coaster?
[11:07.87]I feel great actually.
[11:09.08]Oh yeah?
[11:10.60]Tell me about it.
[11:11.12]Every time we go on a roller coaster I get off and I'm like, oh that was fucking awesome.
[11:17.06]You need to try getting on one.
[11:17.94]You're not gonna tell me to like reach my hand down into like the drained penis thing, right?
[11:26.93]That's not how this is going, right?
[11:31.63]Listen, I just wanted to play some Halo tonight.
[11:34.87]No, you didn't.
[11:36.43]No, you didn't.
[11:37.89]That's a lie.
[11:39.77]You pressed the button.
[11:41.25]You didn't want to play any Halo.
[11:42.47]Fine, I did lie.
[11:43.85]Maybe I didn't want to play Halo.
[11:45.65]That's not the point here.
[11:46.73]The point is, you're being very mean.
[11:48.73]Alright.
[11:50.56]I just wanted to play Halo tonight.
[11:57.98]You've been exposed.
[12:03.14]You've been saying these things to me.
[12:04.38]I don't appreciate it.
[12:06.66]None of my viewers appreciate your hostility.
[12:09.36]I don't know where the fuck this anger and resentment from you is coming from.
[12:14.04]Are you watching the stream right now?
[12:15.22]Look at this.
[12:16.32]No, no, no.
[12:16.72]I'm not watching the stream.
[12:17.44]What are you fucking doing?
[12:18.12]Hang on.
[12:18.28]Put on my stream.
[12:18.96]It's good.
[12:22.65]Guess what's Jerma's channel called?
[12:28.77]I'm just kidding.
[12:34.55]What's his channel?
[12:36.64]Are you still streaming?
[12:38.96]Yep.
[12:39.28]What are you doing?
[12:40.70]What's on the screen?
[12:46.62]Okay, when you're in a situation... Let me give you a real scenario, okay?
[12:50.86]You know when you turn stream on?
[12:53.37]And, you know, alright.
[12:54.71]I got this idea.
[12:55.45]This is my plan.
[12:56.17]Alright.
[12:56.59]Cool.
[12:57.35]This is plan A. And I got, like, maybe a plan B, too, in case something goes awry.
[13:01.17]Whatever.
[13:02.25]So, plan A and plan B both seem like they're not gonna work.
[13:07.17]And then you're sitting there and what... What are you... That's the squad... Where's the squad streaming?
[13:24.81]No, we're not.
[13:25.33]Why are we not squad screaming anymore?
[13:26.79]Wait, what are you doing?
[13:32.58]What are you doing?
[13:38.28]Are you trying to break my computer?
[13:39.68]Stop breaking my computer!
[13:42.76]Alright, I'm here.
[13:43.38]I'm here.
[13:43.83]I'm looking.
[13:44.11]You fucking asshole.
[13:54.31]You dickhead.
[13:57.33]He's ruining my stream.
[13:59.66]Okay.
[14:02.08]Alright, I'm back.
[14:03.76]Are you... Why can I hear myself through you?
[14:11.81]Hey, welcome back to TayZonday Gaming.
[14:13.73]Today we're going to be playing Jerma.
[14:16.91]Jerma is a pretty exciting episode.
[14:19.52]There's a bit of glitches on it.
[14:21.00]It's not the most well-developed level, but I like it a lot.
[14:26.28]What?
[14:26.54]What is he doing?
[14:33.97]Wait, you're just streaming my stream!
[14:39.07]That's illegal!
[14:40.91]That's illegal.
[14:42.65]That's illegal.
[14:46.48]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:48.16]Pretend you're playing the game.
[14:54.34]Guys, I'm about to, like, do my best Jerma impersonation.
[14:58.67]And just, like, record his gameplay.
[15:00.79]And just mute this.
[15:04.35]Jerma, where are you from again?
[15:07.41]From Cincinnati.
[15:11.30]What's that famous for?
[15:13.97]It's in the southwest of the United States.
[15:17.29]You don't know all the states, right?
[15:18.49]It's the fifth of them.
[15:21.23]Yeah.
[15:22.63]It's there somewhere.
[15:23.33]Alright.

[15:27.14]What's your defining accent?
[15:30.00]New England and Boston accent.
[15:33.38]You guys famous for eating clams or something in New England?
[15:39.64]I mean, I don't think we're famous for eating clams.
[15:42.12]I mean, this is... I don't know.
[15:43.48]We're famous.
[15:44.98]Yeah, New England.
[15:45.64]They're all famous.
[15:46.58]Like, I'm famous for eating clams.
[15:49.54]Like, when you eat a clam, all of a sudden, you get popular?
[15:52.32]Well, fucking, I don't know about your culture, right?
[15:54.13]But yeah, it's a Boston accent.
[15:58.33]Alright.
[15:58.87]I need help finding this key.
[16:00.33]Okay, well, listen.
[16:01.71]Like, for me, there's three American accents in my head.

[16:38.89]That's from a movie.
[16:41.25]That's from a movie.
[16:43.81]Not everything seen in the movies is real.
[16:50.83]Alright, I'm sorry.
[16:53.47]Hold on.
[16:53.97]I'm concentrating.
[16:56.38]This game's a hard game.
[16:58.48]So, you're saying that the Boston accent is from a movie as well?
[17:03.10]I mean, not really, but sort of.
[17:06.58]Okay, well, I'll be renting Lord of the Rings on Netflix later on.
[17:11.93]Anyway, I think it's time for us to go.
[17:13.71]I...
[17:18.04]Yeah.
[17:18.42]Everybody, special thanks to Joel for coming out and pretending to like Halo for two hours.
[17:26.40]Very special thanks.
[17:28.10]Thanks.
[17:28.44]Glad to have you.
[17:29.12]And I'll be sure when we do keep talking and nobody explodes to kick your ass.
[17:35.78]I'll tell you what though.
[17:36.60]This might have been like the absolute shittiest slash best stream ever done.
[17:43.01]It's like I don't know what quality is anymore because I don't have any quality control.
[17:47.57]But
[17:49.03]I'll tell you what, like... I think this is cock and ball torture.
[17:54.81]You know what cock and ball torture is?
[18:00.11]Yes.
[18:02.45]You know, there's an element of like... Well, I'm not saying I'm into that stuff, but I'm saying I relate more to that stuff, you know, because... Then to Halo?
[18:09.72]Hold on.
[18:11.58]You relate more to Halo Reach?
[18:16.80]I'm just saying that listen the deal is or well whatever it is I hate pain but I feel compelled to come back so who knows who knows uh anyway I loved it it was fun this this okay in all seriousness not like all shit aside this was a lot of fun I think a lot of the uh
[18:43.56]The fun, inadvertently, was derived from the fact that it was a shit show.
[18:51.05]We came in so underprepared.
[18:53.37]Well, hold on.
[18:55.91]But how do you come in prepared to just play Halo?
[19:00.80]We don't have to read a bunch of books to play Halo.
[19:04.40]Well, it took us like three fucking hours to get into the menu.
[19:06.94]And then after we actually started streaming, then, you know, hey, so...
[19:11.68]No, it was a pleasure.
[19:14.00]We'll see you next time.
[19:15.98]No, no, yeah, for real, though, like, let's, next time, we'll actually set something up that we both enjoy, and it's not fucking 4am in the morning, and it's not me, like, having an episode, alright?
[19:31.75]Like, I need an EpiPen after this fucking stream, like, I feel nauseous in the best way possible, like, I'm gonna...
[19:38.97]I'm gonna vomit my asshole off after this.
[19:40.71]Like, I need a deep cleansing after this over here.
[19:44.45]But regardless, I wanna say... I need to say that this is a lot of fun.
[19:50.48]I wanna say thank you so much for taking time out of your day to ruin your stream.
[19:55.72]And I wish you the best of luck, sir, with your lack of video gaming skills and pompous attitude.
[20:08.73]Oh, I'm gonna take the high road.
[20:11.49]Thanks for hanging out.
[20:14.69]Thanks for hanging out and spending the time with me together.
[20:19.03]And... I want you to have nightmares tonight about chewing on tinfoil.
[20:27.96]And that horrible, horrible, like, weird feeling it is.
[20:30.74]I want you to have a never-ending tinfoil chewing dream.
[20:34.18]You know what?
[20:34.66]You know what, though?
[20:36.10]I have something worse than that, right there.
[20:39.82]I have something worse than that.
[20:41.76]Tinfoil, for me, is not that bad.
[20:46.24]I've heard this analogy before.
[20:48.00]And it hits me going telling stories.
[20:49.24]Fillings.
[20:49.86]You got fillings?
[20:51.64]You know what I think is actually worse than chewing on?
[20:54.62]I don't know if you're going to relate to this or whatever it is, but chewing on cotton.
[20:59.17]Chewing on what?
[21:02.13]Oh, fuck.
[21:02.43]I haven't saved it.
[21:03.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:03.87]Hold that thought.
[21:04.25]I haven't saved.
[21:07.05]Alright, she went on what?
[21:08.99]Cotton?
[21:09.97]I feel like I know what you're talking about.
[21:14.74]I feel like I could think about what that means, yeah.
[21:17.22]Joel, I have an accent too.
[21:31.40]We both have accents.
[21:33.62]You don't fucking have an accent.
[21:35.28]What?
[21:37.20]Name one thing that's accented when you're speaking.
[21:40.14]Okay, what is the thing you drive around in?
[21:42.84]A car.
[21:46.70]Okay, that's a car.
[21:50.43]Drive your car.
[21:51.49]Park.
[21:51.91]Park.
[21:52.87]Hold up, what the fuck are you saying?
[21:56.05]Where are you streaming from right now?
[21:57.91]In your...
[22:01.10]No, no, the box that you're in with the door.
[22:07.68]No, the... deeper.
[22:14.29]Oh, my stomach.
[22:16.23]Okay, the four... The pieces of drywall that are up around you.
[22:21.45]And the door encloses you into a... what?
[22:28.93]If you were to go looking for a new apartment or a new house, you would first want to ask how many bed there were.
[22:35.12]Or how many bed this there were.
[22:36.64]Room.
[22:52.37]Your room.
[22:54.03]See, I... Room, right?
[22:56.27]It's your room.
[22:57.19]I say room, I say like roof.
[22:59.31]Roof.
[22:59.53]Yeah.
[23:08.39]Some people in New York pronounce roof as rough.
[23:12.49]Do you do that?
[23:13.69]You do that?
[23:14.39]No, I don't.
[23:15.57]No, I said, I was answering.
[23:17.09]I was answering.
[23:18.29]That was a lie.
[23:20.24]Concrete fucking proof.
[23:22.28]This is it.
[23:23.32]All these fucking years, I was thinking, no, no, nobody does that, Joel.
[23:28.08]One fucking guy.
[23:29.20]You're crazy, Joel.
[23:30.68]You're fucking nuts.
[23:32.06]Nobody says rough.
[23:33.53]You say fucking rough.
[23:35.79]You guys got fucking call- Jerma's fucking livid proof!
[23:39.74]He's fucking livid proof that- that- that- that- that- You guys were lying to me!
[23:45.17]Mucka ass!
[23:48.37]Did somebody from New York, like, pee on you or something?
[23:52.07]Or, like, shit in your cereal?
[23:53.59]I don't understand.
[23:54.39]No, no.
[23:54.87]I'm just saying Chad has been crapping on me for years for saying, me in New York.
[23:58.36]Did somebody from New York pee in your cereal or something?
[24:00.64]No, no, no.
[24:01.24]I'm just saying Chad Collective peed on me because they pronounce roof as rough.
[24:05.62]And people are saying, like, no.
[24:08.77]Screw you, Joel.
[24:09.59]You're a dumbass Swede.
[24:10.73]You don't know shit about stuff.
[24:11.91]Joel, I'm looking for the door.
[24:13.35]What was that?
[24:15.61]I'm looking for the, uh, the gold door.
[24:17.51]Can you help?
[24:19.13]I forget where it is.
[24:20.67]It's right in front of you.
[24:22.69]I thought you were serious.
[24:23.57]You're not even watching.
[24:24.31]Why am I asking you?
[24:25.79]Yes, I am fucking watching.
[24:26.95]Are you?
[24:28.41]Back where you came.
[24:30.16]Right.
[24:31.62]No, no.
[24:31.90]Go, go.
[24:32.58]Okay.
[24:32.82]Okay.
[24:33.12]Okay.
[24:33.36]Here's what we're going to do.
[24:34.16]Alright.
[24:35.60]Just, just here.
[24:36.56]Just follow what the fuck I'm saying.
[24:38.06]Alright.
[24:38.30]Alright.
[24:38.56]I'll follow.
[24:39.06]Wait, hold on.
[24:40.24]Alright.
[24:40.48]Now I'll follow you.
[24:42.92]Forward.
[24:47.73]Forward.
[24:50.62]Forward.
[24:53.28]Forward.
[24:56.32]Forward.
[24:59.38]Right.
[24:59.76]There's nothing here.
[25:00.82]What are you doing?
[25:02.30]Right.
[25:02.84]Wait, where is the gold door?
[25:04.32]I know, it's down here.
[25:08.64]Thank you.
[25:09.08]Thanks, I appreciate it.
[25:10.85]Actually, you actually did help me.
[25:12.87]I'm still in Halo Reach.
[25:14.23]I know, I have to change that.
[25:19.18]Listen, I was supposed to, like, end the stream, like, hours ago now, and I'm still here fucking arguing about roofs and whatever the hell we're talking about.
[25:29.26]This is the post-Halo Reach meltdown.
[25:35.10]This is the rehab part of the stream.
[25:41.26]Anyway, once again, I want to thank you for taking the time out of your day.
[25:45.26]Thank you for a wonderful evening.
[25:47.28]Severely, uh...
[25:50.39]scarring the stream with a new low in stream quality.
[25:55.88]There was some poo-poo talk and stuff that I wasn't a fan of either.
[26:00.54]I'll address that with you off stream.
[26:05.77]Literally everything I say is pee-poo.
[26:10.28]um anyway anyway uh I'm gonna try to end this now but I want to say in all seriousness though I think more absolutely uh this is this is one of those like first date things and you're like
[26:24.97]Oh, you're fucking the first day too?
[26:26.21]Okay.
[26:26.61]Well, I'm ready to fill my gamer hole.
[26:30.20]So we should definitely... Cut his mic.
[26:34.22]We should definitely stream more and I look forward to solving brain puzzles next time.
[26:41.61]That'll be fun.
[26:43.75]I'm looking forward to that.
[26:45.50]I am.
[26:46.00]I am too.
[26:46.92]But let's not do it at fucking 4am because it's going to give me fucking nightmares some weeks on end.
[26:52.88]I hope you get a good sleep.
[26:55.62]Make sure you put your head on that pillow and rest.
[27:01.64]And have a wonderful rest of your night.
[27:03.18]And everyone that was on Joel's stream, have a great night too.
[27:11.73]All of you.
[27:16.42]Well, this is my cue to leave.
[27:19.84]Yeah, it is, actually.
[27:26.69]You want to pull the plug on ending the call?
[27:30.35]I'm currently fighting a monster.
[27:33.23]Well, if you're a gamer, you would be able to do it.
[27:36.05]You ever seen a game like this before?
[27:37.59]It takes a lot of focus.
[27:45.80]That would be actually kind of cool.
[27:47.26]They should really make a game like that where you hold down right mouse and it's move fast and then left is... That's kind of cool.
[27:53.94]That's not a bad idea.
[27:55.40]Jeremiah, how about this?
[27:56.32]Tell me a story.
[27:59.95]Are you still here?
[28:01.25]Tell me any story you want.
[28:08.38]Okay.
[28:09.24]Once there was a boy named... Let's just say his name was Dave.
[28:15.78]Dave... I can't do this while playing this game.
[28:22.67]It's not gonna happen.
[28:25.63]Two of my hemispheres are fighting each other.
[28:30.70]How about this for a story?
[28:33.20]Oh, he's gone.
[28:33.68]He left.
[28:35.57]That was what it was.
[28:36.43]He wanted me to tell a long story.
[28:37.81]I'm glad I couldn't come up with anything because he left.
[28:39.63]Shut the fuck up already.
[28:41.33]Shut up.
[28:43.41]I know you, little game.
[28:44.81]That's why the story sucked.
[28:46.07]It wasn't even worth listening to because I didn't even tell anything.
[28:48.03]Alright.
[28:52.21]See you later, Joel.
[28:55.75]Alright.
[28:56.55]Okay.
[28:58.84]Cool!
[28:59.38]Alright.
[29:00.02]So that was Halo- Let me change the game name from Halo Reach.
[29:06.82]Dude, that was... The best part about this whole stream is how he was just humoring me playing Halo.
[29:17.97]He just didn't want to play it.
[29:19.09]And it took him two hours to be like, I fucking can't do it.
[29:21.81]And I don't want to play anymore.
[29:28.72]That's the best part.
[29:30.20]But I ain't going anywhere.
[29:31.84]I ain't going anywhere.
[29:32.83]I'm gonna stick around.
[29:44.97]We will play something again.
[29:47.11]That was a good introduction.
[29:49.57]Right?
[29:50.21]I would say so.
[29:52.13]Let me leave the squad so we're not squad streaming anymore.
[29:57.66]I gotta change the... People think I'm playing Halo Reach and they're like, what the fuck are you doing?
[30:04.43]I almost just clicked Raid Channel and raided Shoal.
[30:07.63]Imagine if I did that.
[30:08.29]Alright, let me change... Let me get this on Embiid Evil.
[30:19.66]It always ends in viscera cleanup detail, doesn't it?
[30:23.69]I told you.
[30:24.19]Hey, hold on a second here.
[30:26.31]This is actually really, really interesting.
[30:29.12]Didn't I say yesterday?
[30:30.44]Yeah, yesterday I said a medieval... What the hell is going on?
[30:38.04]Holy, that scared the fuck out of me.
[30:39.88]I thought I was not even in a call.
[30:45.29]Holy shit, that was terrible.
[30:46.65]That actually scared me.
[30:47.69]I thought somebody was like, I'm going to kill me or something.
[30:49.59]I thought someone was going to kill me.
[30:58.35]god alright you know when something like that happens and like you know that nothing can hurt you but like you're the room you're in just became like dangerous that's what happened my room was just dangerous for like a half a second I was like hands are about to go around my neck
[31:20.18]But I did say that nothing can hurt you.
[31:24.42]Yeah, I did say that I was never going to play this again.
[31:26.92]I was like, yeah, I'm just going to say I'm going to play it.
[31:28.26]I'm never going to play it.
[31:28.86]And here we are.
[31:32.96]I'm into it for a little bit.
[31:33.86]I'm into it.
[31:40.93]Dragon Quest Builders.
[31:48.14]Did I just hear a very quiet and nothing's going to hurt?
[31:50.06]No, no, I made sure I left that call.
[31:52.82]Am I going to do Halo again?
[31:53.91]Yeah, you know what?
[31:57.37]I might just... I kind of want to play Halo.
[32:03.05]Like, I kind of want to play Halo.
[32:05.33]I might just play it.
[32:07.57]And put it on like a hard.
[32:14.52]What if I went back to Halo right now?
[32:20.70]I feel like I can't do that today.
[32:23.26]I feel like I can't do that today.
[32:25.76]That's like tomorrow.
[32:32.42]Do it with somebody else.
[32:36.50]Okay, now that's fucking funny.
[32:38.54]Just don't tell them.
[32:41.60]Don't tell them, okay?
[32:43.94]Whoever does the Halo campaign tomorrow, do not tell them that I got abandoned because they... No.
[32:53.10]It's as if we were starting it over.
[33:01.55]It's very important that nobody says anything.
[33:19.27]Imagine if I get another two hours go by and it's like, I hate this.
[33:23.79]I have to leave.
[33:25.55]And I can never play Halo.
[33:28.97]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[33:31.34]I'll never see the end of Halo Reach.
[33:34.28]Everybody that I ever try to play with just humors me for two hours and then doesn't want to play anymore.
[33:40.70]That's very funny.
[33:43.74]We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[33:45.50]I'll put a few lines out.
[33:54.10]That's making me laugh, though.
[33:57.38]I'll throw a few lines out tomorrow, we'll see.
[34:06.79]That's so fucking funny.
[34:12.80]Yeah, it has to be somebody that hasn't played it.
[34:18.68]Hey, yeah, I decided to play Halo- Wait, where are you gonna play- I heard you were gonna play Halo Reach yesterday.
[34:24.24]No.
[34:25.68]No, I decided there were unforeseen circumstances.
[34:29.32]No.
[34:31.36]And I don't want to tell them anything.
[34:32.36]And I really think that I might get abandoned again.
[34:36.30]And that's funny.
[34:39.70]What if I ask Joel to do it again tomorrow?
[34:45.22]Oh, fuck.
[34:45.62]I'm dead.
[34:50.36]What was the last thing I did?
[34:53.32]I didn't even save it, did I?
[34:54.12]Yeah, I did.
[34:56.96]Just play solo.
[35:02.51]I could use a better weapon.
[35:04.25]What's six?
[35:05.29]I want this thing.
[35:05.85]Yeah, this is better.
[35:12.45]Isn't it great?
[35:13.51]So remember, keep this in mind.
[35:14.92]You gotta keep this very much in mind.
[35:17.34]I have never played Halo before.
[35:19.76]My first experience, that was my actual first Halo experience.
[35:27.13]That's like going to buy all the best ingredients from the cake store.
[35:32.01]You go to the best bakery in town.
[35:36.66]And then you, instead of following the directions on the back of the cake mix thing with all the best ingredients, you just put it all into a bowl, mush it up with your hands, taste it, say this tastes fucked up and gross, and then throw it in the toilet.
[36:00.60]That's the equivalent.
[36:05.36]You're just sitting on the toilet.
[36:07.32]Right.
[36:14.16]Did he get him?
[36:15.72]Oh my god, how can I not hit you?
[36:24.10]Wait, what happened?
[36:25.50]What did he say?
[36:25.94]What did he say?
[36:28.24]What did he say?
[36:36.91]Joel's in the chat.
[36:37.69]He called you a toilet.
[36:41.90]What do you mean?
[36:43.22]He just called me a toilet?
[36:46.18]Or did he call me from the toilet?
[36:49.58]I'm confused.
[36:55.00]I didn't even say fuck.
[36:58.56]Alright.
[36:59.00]I gotta focus.
[36:59.52]This is a hard level.
[37:00.72]Hard level.
[37:01.18]Focus.
[37:01.50]Get out the grenade launcher.
[37:06.46]Oh, you are the toilet.
[37:08.10]Alright, big room opens.
[37:17.03]Got it.
[37:28.90]Wait, what is he, is he, is he... Even off, even off stream he's terrorizing my live stream?
[37:40.26]Even off.
[37:40.98]Even off.
[37:41.38]Well, off.
[37:42.14]Camera.
[37:48.90]Fuck that shield.
[37:49.64]Get down.
[37:53.95]I deserved it.
[37:55.88]I didn't do anything to deserve it.
[37:59.82]Play Halo.
[38:02.14]Everyone says, Jeremy, you gotta try Halo.
[38:05.13]Oh, it's so fun.
[38:06.45]It's like one of the best games ever.
[38:08.91]This franchise is so good.
[38:10.29]I just wanted to play Halo with a friend.
[38:18.41]That's all I wanted.
[38:22.31]And then I was called names.
[38:26.54]For two hours.
[38:32.38]Nostalgia goggles?
[38:34.14]But, okay, that might be true.
[38:36.96]Maybe.
[38:37.26]I don't know.
[38:38.14]But I don't have any of those goggles.
[38:39.85]I never, I didn't, I didn't play it.
[38:44.31]I don't own a pair of those goggles.
[38:50.24]I'm coming in with a pure, no bullshit attitude.
[38:56.34]No, like, oh, I did this already, and it's... That was fun.
[38:59.59]Nope.
[38:59.89]Oh, I got it.
[39:03.61]They're not the best games ever, but they're great.
[39:06.03]Yeah, we'll find out.
[39:07.49]When I convince somebody else to play it tomorrow.
[39:12.63]And pretend like it's the first time I've done it.
[39:15.39]Oh, no.
[39:16.49]Here's the play.
[39:20.01]I just load it from my game and just say that I did a little bit of it off-stream.
[39:25.59]That makes sense.
[39:34.26]He's still in chat.
[39:38.56]What do you want from me?
[39:44.80]Haven't you done enough?
[39:54.36]MonkaS.
[39:57.69]Alright, this way, this way, this way.
[39:58.67]Say sorry.
[40:01.21]Since when do you have to apologize for things that aren't real?
[40:10.17]You're a booger streamer.
[40:13.44]Hey.
[40:14.70]Easy.
[40:26.63]Wait, they never even played Halo.
[40:30.52]No, that was Halo Reach first ever experience.
[40:36.58]You know what?
[40:36.90]I probably wouldn't have it any other way.
[40:38.32]Alright, water release.
[40:44.25]Good, good, good, good, good.
[40:46.53]What about over here?
[40:51.74]I love the little spots to go in.
[40:54.76]This way?
[40:55.90]No.
[40:58.10]It was just a friend.
[41:06.76]I got... Ah, damn it.
[41:09.34]Damn it, I got pranked.
[41:12.05]Where's the camera?
[41:12.73]Where is it?
[41:13.25]Which one?
[41:13.57]Just point it.
[41:13.89]Where's the camera?
[41:20.05]Just right there?
[41:21.09]Okay.
[41:22.95]How are you still awake?
[41:24.19]Holy shit.
[41:25.66]You're still awake.
[41:35.74]It's late.
[41:39.10]Joel is drunk.
[41:39.90]Wait, Joel is drinking?
[41:45.48]Hold on, I... Joel is drinking.
[41:52.92]I don't play with streamers that drink.
[41:54.68]This is a- I'm a dry channel.
[41:56.72]Why was that not told to me before?
[42:04.72]Actually kind of like annoyed by that in a way because why wouldn't somebody tell me?
[42:16.43]No, be like serious, like be serious.
[42:18.95]Was he actually drinking and participating in a duo live stream with me?
[42:29.18]I know maybe some of you came over from Joel's stream, but we don't mess around with that.
[42:37.43]Next you'll tell me that he listens to rock music.
[42:40.11]Okay, okay.
[42:54.00]I'll believe that when I see it.
[43:03.67]Bye.
[43:04.01]Alright, bye.
[43:05.19]Is this door open?
[43:16.00]Wait, don't open it yet.
[43:20.02]No, he's saying bye, but he's actually not leaving.
[43:23.39]See, right now he's going to take a shower or go into the bathroom.
[43:27.33]And he brought his phone with him into the bathroom.
[43:29.91]And this stream is still on.
[43:31.95]And he's right now going like... But you'll never know that.
[43:37.06]I right now am on the floor at max volume while he's taking a shower.
[43:41.58]Because he doesn't want to miss a second of Jerma985.
[43:44.84]So he turns the shower on so it's very low pressure.
[43:47.64]And turns the volume up and puts the phone on the ground so it reverberates on the ground.
[43:50.60]So you can still hear while you're in the shower.
[44:09.76]and then you get pissed off because god damn it I don't I I I'm watching this and I'm thinking about just not cleaning myself to continue to watch this thing that I'm watching right now
[44:30.78]And then you go, no, no, no, no, no, whatever.
[44:32.72]I'll catch up later.
[44:33.50]And then you, you know, if the shower's too loud, what are you going to do?
[44:41.41]That's why I propose the next big thing is going to be, and I'm not talking about, this is just for the rich, like rich, rich, rich people.
[44:49.80]I'm talking about a monitor, like an iPad style tablet that's in your shower.
[44:58.07]that is completely waterproof and it's like 60 bucks that's the next step it exists yeah but what is it like a grand or something was it like two grand I'm not gonna buy that I would buy it if it was like 40 bucks what's happening what's happening seeing a lot of I'm seeing a lot of laughing faces
[45:30.18]Just put your iPad in a plastic bag.
[45:33.28]And what, hold it?
[45:36.21]Put your iPad in a plastic bag and hold it with you in the shower.
[45:44.37]Yeah, but that's messed up.
[45:47.07]Taking a shower with a monitor is normal.
[45:51.64]Taking a shower with an iPad in a plastic bag is fucking weird.
[46:02.41]I'm talking about if you have a monitor in front of you.
[46:05.47]Where your bar of soap is right there.
[46:07.69]Next to the bar of soap is your hair conditioner and your shampoo.
[46:12.58]And then there's this 7 inch screen that's embedded into the wall.
[46:24.26]This is a bit... I mean, I would want that.
[46:26.54]I'm getting one.
[46:30.83]Oh my god, there's a trap in here.
[46:34.55]You have to be rich.
[46:38.09]How do I get this?
[46:43.15]And you didn't think I could do Halo on fucking Legendary?
[46:46.71]You didn't think it was possible?
[47:01.88]Hmm?
[47:04.16]This is me in my true environment.
[47:05.54]Look at that, one hit.
[47:16.21]I used to believe, but not anymore.
[47:25.74]This is a really good just kind of background game, isn't it?
[47:32.37]The less I think about the game, the better I do when I play it.
[47:36.17]That's it.
[47:38.45]Now, I know a lot of people will definitely think that that was on purpose.
[47:41.15]And I don't blame you at all.
[47:42.44]I really don't.
[47:44.02]Because of how perfect it was for me to say that and then fall off the cliff.
[47:48.10]I know that everyone thinks that that was on purpose.
[47:50.44]So the only way I can avoid from being called out for being like a nice tuber joke, you fucking loser.
[47:56.80]I'm going to just say that I did that on purpose.
[47:58.61]Because there's no way I can say that I didn't.
[48:03.66]I don't even know where this guy came from.
[48:15.14]It's reverse psychology.
[48:20.14]I could prove why it happened, but it won't be enough.
[48:23.85]It won't be enough.
[48:26.16]I will never be able to get away from the sea, the sea of jermaIQ spam and LULs.
[48:33.41]It won't ever, it'll be there, and I will never be able to get away from it.
[48:55.19]Joel vs. Jerma Doom Deathmatch.
[48:56.92]I would win.
[49:00.64]I would win, absolutely.
[49:02.35]You guys see... I have experience, so... Do you really think that I... You don't think I'd be able to do that?
[49:13.40]Like, did you see when I played Dusk?
[49:16.34]And I played it at the hardest difficulty, and I remember people in the chat going like, holy fuck, man, he actually is pretty good at this shit.
[49:25.02]Like, usually he falls off the edge and you can laugh, but not this time.
[49:36.21]Are you an egomaniac?
[49:41.57]I don't think so.
[49:42.77]Is this a trap?
[49:46.21]Wait.
[49:47.65]Go down.
[49:53.19]There it is.
[49:53.75]Alright, that is the gold key.
[49:58.27]Oh, fuck.
[49:59.17]Bombs.
[50:00.07]Give me the bombs.
[50:03.75]Actually, you know what?
[50:07.09]Let's do this real quick.
[50:13.90]No one said that.
[50:17.20]I have logs of every stream.
[50:19.81]I have a log of every single thing anyone's ever said here.
[50:24.55]If I type in the exact quote, I didn't think he was going to be very good at this game.
[50:30.67]He actually is doing really well.
[50:31.96]End quote.
[50:32.36]Search.
[50:36.72]Oh.
[50:36.86]41 results.
[50:37.56]Interesting.
[50:37.96]Interesting.
[50:44.94]Is this the gold door?
[50:46.08]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[50:46.98]Save it.
[50:50.58]Omega lull result.
[50:53.14]Get out of here.
[50:56.97]Omega lull.
[50:58.33]Whoa!
[50:59.01]He just went real fast.
[51:13.92]Excuse me.
[51:15.06]Excuse me.
[51:15.70]Alright, what's your guys' favorite weapon in the medieval?
[51:26.32]Mine's the sideways sword.
[51:28.64]Or, uh, also known as green door.
[51:36.08]Grenade launcher?
[51:36.66]That's pretty good, too.
[51:37.40]You're right.
[51:39.56]Wish me good night?
[51:40.90]Have a great night.
[51:42.57]Good night.
[51:48.91]Alright, we're we're we're the way got ya.
[51:57.36]Oh shucks.
[51:58.00]Thanks.
[51:58.30]You're very welcome.
[51:59.98]Have a great one The golf club was a golf club When I when you when yes when I sneeze you don't say bless you I
[52:18.03]I can't hear you sneezing.
[52:21.47]I don't know if you're sneezing or not.
[52:29.65]Get up here.
[52:31.39]I opened the green door, so what... Where do I go now?
[52:40.52]Just say it every few minutes, just in case?
[52:42.02]I mean, that would probably work, but...
[52:48.45]Did this open now?
[52:50.51]I think I didn't press a button.
[52:52.21]I saw one and I didn't press it.
[52:55.99]No, it's this way.
[52:59.71]Ooh!
[53:00.69]Jerma, are you okay?
[53:04.93]Yeah, I'm good.
[53:06.41]What?
[53:12.76]He's not alright.
[53:14.74]That's what he would say if he was not alright.
[53:19.85]Oh shit.
[53:29.09]Joel's still watching?
[53:29.93]Yeah, Joel's phone at this point, he put it in his toilet.
[53:33.19]So the reverberations from the bowl and the water fill up the bowl and then it's like a big speaker aiming up like a satellite into the bathroom.
[53:46.39]He puts it in a plastic bag though, so it's fine, don't worry.
[53:53.63]Wait, hold on.
[54:02.30]Need help.
[54:06.96]5G toilet.
[54:10.98]I mean, you guys laugh, but don't you think the most important place for you to have better wireless coverage is in your bathroom?
[54:20.93]I'm going to be completely and totally real with you here.
[54:22.71]This is not made up.
[54:24.05]This is not a joke.
[54:26.16]My cell phone is used, I would say, me actually taking my phone out of my pocket or just looking at my phone screen happens 50 to 60% of the time when I'm sitting on the toilet.
[54:44.43]That's a fact.
[54:47.15]I need silver key.
[54:55.76]That's because... No, no.
[54:58.92]That's just the only time I use it.
[55:00.22]That's the time where it's like, alright, what's going on right now?
[55:02.85]I don't have to pay attention to anything.
[55:05.81]It's not like I'm doing something.
[55:07.37]That's the time where I have... That's my telephone time.
[55:10.79]If you've had a conversation with me on the phone, there is a very large chance that I was sitting on the toilet while I was talking to you.
[55:21.21]And then I get a little self-conscious about it because you can hear the echo of you're in a bathroom echo.
[55:28.87]And you try to mitigate that a little bit by, there's different techniques you can use.
[55:39.83]Oh man, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time.
[55:43.76]Here we go.
[55:52.64]Keep going.
[55:53.05]Move, move, move, move, move.
[55:54.23]Who else?
[55:54.57]You.
[55:56.23]Oh, I just fucking yeeted that guy.
[56:01.32]In quotes and brackets, he says that to be... look like he's part of the younger generation.
[56:25.42]Okay, I need that there it is alright back to that little pod Well, I'm not allowed to say yeet and why is that There are some things I can't say some things I can say
[56:53.27]What does this mean?
[56:54.47]That means it's like a secret over here, right?
[57:05.94]It means... yes.
[57:10.88]That's Pac-Man LOL.
[57:15.67]You know what's really weird about the word you just said, LOL?
[57:18.87]If I say LOL, everybody laughs at me.
[57:21.92]They go, wow, look at this guy trying to use LOL.
[57:25.52]That was like the internet slang when I was younger.
[57:29.72]Why can't I say LOL?
[57:32.32]That's a word that I should be able to say, because that's what we said.
[57:43.25]It's old internet slang, yeah.
[57:45.41]It means laugh out loud.
[57:46.47]And if I say laugh out loud, people go, wow, he's actually, he said L-O-L.
[57:52.48]And then I go, alright, well, I'll do L-U-L.
[57:54.44]Don't, get away from, get away from me and my generation.
[57:56.84]And I go, fuck, okay.
[57:58.38]Ha ha.
[57:59.24]Whoa, that's sarcastic.
[58:01.30]No, um, I'm, I thought that was funny.
[58:04.77]Alright, where's that silver door over here?
[58:11.71]There are rules.
[58:16.22]Who am I talking to?
[58:20.37]Um... Shit, I don't know.
[58:29.55]So what did that do?
[58:35.72]Nobody in particular.
[58:37.02]I'm just sort of speaking.
[58:44.27]Oh, let me get it.
[58:44.83]I missed it.
[58:46.71]I missed it twice.
[58:47.41]I mean, that would have been great if I got them all.
[58:51.73]If I bowled it in the right... Oh, I did it.
[58:55.28]Zero secrets.
[58:56.04]God damn it.
[59:01.62]You're talking to yourself.
[59:05.81]What's the title of the stream right now?
[59:25.21]oh yeah reach with training wheels on you could describe this stream as that you could just that was what this what that was okay title change the title to um should I make the name the title see you tomorrow
[59:55.17]That's kind of accurate.
[59:55.95]Alright, how about... Play Reach.
[60:07.78]How about just... Hopping around... With...
[60:20.60]My stick.
[60:21.82]No.
[60:22.16]Hopping around.
[60:23.56]FPS.
[60:24.94]FPS indie game.
[60:27.00]Old school style.
[60:27.95]FPS indie game.
[60:29.97]FPS styled.
[60:31.81]Shooter.
[60:32.35]Hard game.
[60:36.79]Whopping around.
[60:38.08]That's good.
[60:39.50]Whopping around is fine.
[60:50.02]Where am I at?
[60:50.88]Alright, let's go.
[60:58.30]I like this level.
[60:58.78]This level's big.
[61:01.28]Take my hand.
[61:17.68]What's the difficulty on here?
[61:20.44]Oh!
[61:21.22]Hard.
[61:21.60]Just on hard.
[61:23.38]I think there's one after it, but I couldn't find it.
[61:26.14]It's legendary.
[61:29.39]Legendary Halo.
[61:36.97]It's on baby mode.
[61:38.06]This one's not on baby mode.
[61:40.40]I can assure you.
[61:54.08]Prove it?
[61:55.69]How do I... How do I prove that?
[62:00.39]Any news on the King stream?
[62:01.65]Yes.
[62:02.63]I actually do have something to say.
[62:05.26]It is on schedule.
[62:10.14]So there was a thought that maybe it would have to be pushed potentially like a week or so, maybe?
[62:14.91]But we're still on schedule.
[62:17.61]And next week is going to be the real testing and setting up the whitelisting stuff.
[62:25.53]Apparently, according to what I've been told, it's probably going to be pretty easy to do.
[62:31.70]So they're working on it.
[62:33.14]Should be good to go.
[62:44.90]What do I think will happen?
[62:47.48]I have a few theories on what I think will happen on that stream, but let's let them be out there, right?
[62:55.88]I'd rather it happen naturally and occur the way that it was going to occur.
[63:07.87]Oh, shit.
[63:14.91]open oh that's a I need this I haven't even used any of this once this isn't gonna be a month in the making for a five minute stream
[63:31.00]Don't I don't think so.
[63:33.52]I don't think so regardless of what happens just Just know It don't matter it'll be fun regardless I would use yeah, let's just use it Didn't kill him what that should have killed all three of you That's bullshit
[64:09.88]Who's coming?
[64:10.72]Who's here?
[64:19.19]How's the server info gonna work?
[64:21.77]Um...
[64:24.76]not 100 sure yet and I don't want to give info that's inaccurate so next week around I'd say like six or seven days from right now I'll have more actual concrete information so I don't want to be like oh this is how it's going to work and it's like no that that is not how it's going to work so I'd rather give you the details when they're actually they actually exist you need a king stream explanation sure thing
[64:54.07]So, it is set for December 15th, is the first one.
[65:00.48]It's going to be a potential series where the goal is to just exist in a town, in a 500 to 1,000 person Minecraft server, concurrent connections.
[65:16.99]And the goal is for me to just exist as the king and for people to be loyal subjects.
[65:23.91]And if I die, then it's over.
[65:34.60]So... And there are things in place that I don't want to talk about.
[65:39.76]To... People think, oh wow, you're just going to die in two minutes.
[65:44.76]Not so sure about that.
[65:49.64]It's not just, I'm going to turn the server on, turn around and run in the direction.
[65:54.72]Nope.
[65:56.14]I'm gonna have personal bodyguards.
[65:57.42]There's gonna be an aging system in the game.
[66:01.34]Uh, where's this gold key?
[66:05.87]Have I not seen it?
[66:10.35]And I'm told all this stuff that's happening is doing very well, and it's on point, and it's almost ready to go.
[66:14.79]How did I miss a key?
[66:18.43]What did I miss?
[66:24.85]This way?
[66:25.29]How do I open that door?
[66:30.14]How do I get up here?
[66:32.08]I had to have missed something.
[66:34.74]Minecraft.
[66:35.48]Oh, this.
[66:35.78]Here we go.
[66:37.78]Minecraft Boomers.
[66:40.92]Well, Minecraft is the only game where this can probably physically work.
[66:47.68]I was looking at a lot of different titles.
[66:49.97]Stuff like Ark and Conan Exiles.
[66:56.02]Minecraft is one of the only games that would probably even have the capability to have more than three, four, five hundred people in the same spot concurrently at the same time.
[67:08.86]And this is also the first one, the first attempt to do this.
[67:13.48]If it works out well and it's really fun, there's plans to add a shitload more stuff to it and do it like on a once a week basis.
[67:35.30]Yeah, this is like Rust, Gmod, but Minecraft is so easily manipulatable with plugins and mods that we figured it might be the easiest one to start with.
[67:48.11]And we're going to go from there.
[67:50.17]Alright, press this button.
[67:59.53]Yeah, and also, everybody also does have Minecraft.
[68:01.77]Like, if you...
[68:04.69]If you have a computer and it's played a video game on it more than once, you probably have Minecraft on some account somewhere.
[68:15.89]It also doesn't take very much to run it.
[68:17.96]I need to get up there.
[68:24.52]How do I get up there?
[68:26.34]There's a button I can... Where's a button?
[68:27.86]There's a button.
[68:38.07]Minecraft is very laggy.
[68:40.51]Yeah, I've been told that there are going to be things to help mitigate that.
[68:47.18]I've been told there is a bunch of things to selectively render things and free up space.
[68:53.42]These guys seem to know what they're doing.
[68:58.78]We'll see.
[68:59.94]Look, it's a big experiment, but it's one that I want to try.
[69:04.51]I feel like it could be fucking fun and hilarious no matter what.
[69:08.38]He's been told by insider sources.
[69:09.86]That's correct.
[69:10.96]Who are these guys?
[69:12.52]They are Minecraft server and mod plugin developers.
[69:20.06]That's when I refer to these guys.
[69:23.96]Alright, let's get in that door.
[69:33.95]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[69:35.29]Where'd you come from?
[69:36.07]Dude.
[69:50.34]Notch cameo?
[69:51.50]Guys, I wouldn't be surprised if Notch didn't remember his Minecraft password.
[70:02.19]No, no, there's no- that's not a thing.
[70:04.87]Let me quell that.
[70:10.79]Shit.
[70:25.50]What is Notch up to these days?
[70:27.18]Is he making any new games or anything?
[70:40.07]He's living... He lives alone in his candy room.
[70:44.81]What do you mean?
[70:45.65]You mean he had like a room... He had a house Willy Wonka style made out of candy?
[70:50.84]Like an edible home?
[71:02.40]Probably.
[71:02.88]I love how that's not real, but the answer to that is probably.
[71:11.41]Oh man, he took off my fucking head.
[71:12.95]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[71:28.93]Gimme the stick.
[71:30.09]The stick.
[71:30.96]I want the stick.
[71:32.55]Give me the stick.
[71:33.97]No, wrong stick.
[71:35.33]I don't have any ammo for the stick, that's why.
[71:36.67]Alright, I get it.
[71:37.01]Let's go.
[71:37.19]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die,
[72:03.37]A two.
[72:03.69]A three.
[72:06.33]Alright, good.
[72:10.93]He beat Halo.
[72:12.27]It was really good.
[72:15.49]Now I understand what the hype is all about.
[72:16.92]This room is moving now.
[72:27.20]Oh, shit.
[72:31.84]Really, kind of a short game.
[72:34.70]What was that?
[72:35.44]An hour and 40 minutes?
[72:38.36]I thought it was going to be a little longer.
[72:40.08]Don't worry, we had the medieval backup.
[73:09.26]What really happened?
[73:11.14]Oh, you may not have been here.
[73:12.77]Joel hates Halo.
[73:30.30]What really happened?
[73:33.17]You know, any explanation as to what actually happened can just get muddy to not even being real.
[73:40.13]That's the weird part.
[73:42.23]Any way to explain why I'm not playing Halo Reach right now could come off as not even real.
[73:48.17]Like, oh, that's a made-up joke.
[73:50.07]That's a joke.
[73:50.59]Okay, that's funny.
[73:51.57]Alright, this guy's pissing me off.
[74:04.42]Oh, this place is stupid.
[74:06.58]Okay.
[74:08.48]Looking for a key?
[74:17.87]Turn on warrior mode.
[74:19.05]It improves the game.
[74:21.53]What does it do?
[74:24.09]What is it?
[74:24.37]The latency?
[74:26.01]Yeah.
[74:27.72]Yeah.
[74:28.20]Do you want the real?
[74:29.30]The real answer?
[74:33.90]The P2... the P2 pants latency was like a lot and clicking your mouse and firing the weapon happened like... like... probably a half second after you did it.
[74:48.10]That's the real answer.
[74:55.05]Oh, fuck.
[74:56.19]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where, where, where, where, where?
[75:04.72]Don't die here.
[75:06.02]Please.
[75:08.94]I need that health.
[75:11.90]Ooh.
[75:12.78]Okay, these jumps are a little tricky.
[75:16.36]Didn't make it.
[75:21.66]The game has a bug where P2P has a lot of input delay.
[75:25.12]Yeah.
[75:26.48]So it's probably for the best.
[75:29.50]But still.
[75:31.96]But still.
[75:35.03]Uh, can I make that jump?
[75:36.35]Let's find out.
[75:38.25]Well, we'll find out in a second.
[75:54.17]I didn't even get it?
[75:54.91]How did I not get it?
[75:58.67]This- my body's too big- my body's big enough to-
[76:13.32]I gotta make this out of... I'm gonna die.
[76:17.30]Just kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[76:22.86]Okay.
[76:24.31]Let's do this first.
[76:28.01]Where is it?
[76:28.33]Right here?
[76:33.57]125 health.
[76:34.33]Wow.
[76:35.31]200 health, actually.
[76:35.83]Holy shit.
[76:36.81]That was very worth doing.
[76:38.59]Very much so.
[76:39.73]Gimme my stick.
[76:52.46]Baby, I'm here.
[76:54.48]That's the best boss ever in a video game.
[76:58.36]It's pretty close.
[77:00.66]Alright, now we gotta do this again.
[77:01.82]All roads lead to visceral cleanup detail.
[77:15.93]Not today, though.
[77:27.18]Where is it?
[77:27.48]Get- oh, shit.
[77:31.20]The original spill joke.
[77:35.00]Joke.
[77:41.50]Where are you?
[77:41.86]Get up here.
[77:43.42]I knew you- both of you.
[77:44.80]I knew you were both coming from here, and I still- alright, my hand's getting stuck onto my desk.
[77:58.28]Die!
[78:07.61]Somebody knows what I mean by that.
[78:09.83]So, I have one of those pull-out things under the desk that you slide in and out.
[78:16.59]And sometimes when I'm gaming really hard, it pushes back in.
[78:20.48]So then I end up, when I lift my mouse up, it's on the top.
[78:24.68]You know, underneath the desk.
[78:35.97]When you're gaming really hard.
[78:39.39]Okay, this is gonna be... Speaking of hard.
[78:41.74]This looks like a really shitty room that I wish I had held onto most of my... Stuff I like to use!
[78:47.86]Because there are arrows just flying over here.
[78:50.92]Ayayay.
[78:54.18]Ayayay.
[78:57.82]I gotta go right down a little.
[79:04.07]Don't block it back at me.
[79:13.65]Oh, never mind.
[79:14.37]I thought these were all enemies aiming fire arrows at me.
[79:18.39]I'm good.
[79:30.80]Does Jerma like anime?
[79:33.64]Uh, yes.
[79:34.16]Once a year.
[79:37.05]Look at that fucking kill.
[79:44.01]Once a year.
[79:52.57]I'm just kind of... I'm just... I'm chilling right now.
[79:54.84]This... I feel actually... I feel pretty good.
[79:59.04]You know when you just hit that kind of mode where you just... You're just chilling.
[80:03.44]My utter and severe and sheer disappointment with playing with Joel is... I feel pretty great right now.
[80:21.49]Uh-oh.
[80:22.53]What happened?
[80:28.23]Alright, here's what really happened.
[80:38.56]Oh my god.
[80:43.62]You know what?
[80:44.00]Let's see if we can get it.
[80:44.74]You should see my face right now.
[81:03.95]What are you doing over there?
[81:05.49]These base cam... Base cam tees.
[81:18.30]I don't want to pick that up.
[81:20.54]Should I, though?
[81:21.06]I mean, no.
[81:22.64]That's a free refill.
[81:24.04]Why would I pick up a free refill right now?
[81:27.80]I don't... Maybe I can't come... I don't know.
[81:29.80]Whatever.
[81:30.04]Just get it.
[81:31.63]Flo...
[81:33.93]Oh, it's a fly.
[81:34.83]I can fly.
[81:36.21]Oh.
[81:42.35]I get it.
[81:42.75]There's a timer on this, too.
[81:52.02]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[81:53.22]I'm not gonna do it.
[81:56.57]I'm not gonna do it.
[81:58.15]It's alright.
[81:59.33]Just wait for it to respawn.
[82:10.60]Sequence complete.
[82:12.51]Can I like leave?
[82:13.97]What does that do?
[82:20.35]Fizzy lifting drinks.
[82:22.69]Well, not quite.
[82:25.05]Up.
[82:30.76]I ran out of gas.
[82:44.98]I have like no ammo for anything.
[82:59.34]Excuse me.
[83:03.16]Oh fuck, I forgot I was floating.
[83:06.25]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[83:07.17]If you stop moving, you die.
[83:08.17]If you stop moving, you die.
[83:13.22]Yo, let me pick up all this shit.
[83:20.10]Whatever, I'll get it back immediately.
[83:25.50]I need ammo.
[83:28.54]5G wizard wand.
[83:30.28]That's the one.
[83:34.94]I like this room.
[83:35.58]I like this room, too.
[83:37.68]I like this whole level.
[83:38.88]It's probably my favorite so far.
[83:41.92]There's a lot of verticality, as they say, right?
[83:56.94]Bounce it around, and then... No.
[84:03.31]They do say that.
[84:04.41]Yeah, they do.
[84:05.13]Not giving a wings.
[84:15.72]I like you.
[84:16.26]Hey, thanks!
[84:18.82]You're not so bad yourself.
[84:20.92]How does that sound?
[84:26.28]Jeremy, you have to be funnier.
[84:27.32]Your sponsor is watching.
[84:34.48]Why would my sponsor want me to be funny?
[84:38.06]Do they only pay me sponsorship money if they think my stream is funny?
[84:47.26]Imagine the rules.
[84:48.06]Imagine what that contract would be.
[84:51.72]Yes, the CEO of the company is going to come into your stream every time you stream, and at least once he has to audibly laugh in the office, or we rip your contract in half.
[85:07.04]That's some weirdo billionaire shit.
[85:20.25]Hey Jerma, I'm Frank here with... In Warrior Mode, you don't keep your weapons on each level.
[85:28.09]Each level has their own weapons.
[85:33.35]Oh, I see what you mean.
[85:34.09]So you don't get to just play with whatever you want.
[85:36.35]You have to get with what the level gives you, and that's it.
[85:42.39]This is a boss.
[85:45.25]Has to be, right?
[85:49.57]Alright, let's go.
[85:52.85]Solar Saint?
[85:53.59]Oh, where's he going?
[86:05.15]Pick up everything.
[86:10.62]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[86:17.20]Whoa!
[86:26.44]Health.
[86:27.08]I have 20 health?
[86:30.06]Where's he going?
[86:31.88]OK.
[86:32.20]Where is he?
[86:55.62]Oh man, that's... What?
[87:05.20]That was really... If you touch it, you're dead?
[87:12.22]I'm not sure I even like that.
[87:13.30]I'm not sure I like that one.
[87:19.78]Hold on, let's try this again.
[87:21.68]Maybe I should just buy this item.
[87:29.12]No, this ain't working.
[87:30.32]No, that's the right idea.
[87:32.52]Kill me, please.
[87:39.76]What should I use against him?
[87:43.42]I feel like this is probably going to do the most damage, but hold on.
[87:46.22]Let me go this way.
[87:54.25]Yeah, this is it.
[87:59.57]and no explosions to kill me instantly.
[88:08.73]Health.
[88:17.90]Health.
[88:19.08]Dude, he does this quick little head bash.
[88:25.22]Can't get that close.
[88:36.00]When does he do it?
[88:40.02]He's gonna do it now.
[88:40.84]Just run in a circle.
[88:46.17]Oh!
[88:47.77]Oh, fuck!
[88:48.95]Okay, you gotta back up.
[88:53.53]You gotta back up.
[88:54.29]It's all about backtracking.
[89:00.92]I would run underneath him.
[89:07.37]I could just run by him.
[89:10.61]Stop shaking my screen.
[89:38.95]My face is itchy.
[89:39.73]I don't know what to do.
[89:40.74]Fuck.
[89:41.42]Holy fuck.
[89:45.24]He just... I can't believe he just timed that perfectly.
[89:48.14]That sucked.
[89:52.43]How did he time that?
[89:53.59]How did he time that so well?
[90:09.51]Oh, fuck.
[90:10.21]I got him.
[90:12.61]God damn.
[90:16.65]I collect all the stuff.
[90:23.90]No, it doesn't matter.
[90:28.20]So, should I try warrior mode?
[90:29.78]Should I activate it?
[90:37.92]Goddammit, that boss took me 60 tries.
[90:39.74]Hey, thanks for being a quote I can pull later.
[90:47.13]Looks like we have, what, two or three more areas?
[90:51.51]Alright, so Warrior Mode, huh?
[90:57.41]I'll give it a try.
[90:58.81]Warrior Mode.
[90:59.61]Start each level with only the axe.
[91:05.16]Oh, you have to, in every level, you have to pick up the weapons.
[91:07.71]Would you look at that.
[91:10.65]Alright, where am I going?
[91:15.51]It gives each level a unique flavor.
[91:19.57]I like flavors.
[91:21.92]Alright, oh!
[91:23.22]Sacred Path sounds good to me.
[91:26.78]That sounds good to me.
[91:33.46]Taste the level.
[91:38.13]Journeyman's Way.
[91:39.03]What?
[91:41.69]Oh, okay.
[91:43.21]And look, we get my favorite weapon right off the bat.
[91:47.10]What a delicious green apple flavor.
[91:49.54]I'm so happy to have this.
[91:54.44]I love that artificial, almost poison-like taste of green apple artificial flavoring.
[92:08.02]The best green apple flavoring is the one that you can taste in your nostrils.
[92:13.96]Alright, so, where am I going?
[92:17.99]Am I gonna die if I go in there?
[92:24.27]The Journeyman's Way leads to the Apostle's Shrine.
[92:29.14]That's cool, man, but how am I supposed to get over there?
[92:31.70]Take the big bridge?
[92:45.92]Um... Elevator?
[92:58.51]Well, I got another weapon.
[93:01.29]Oh, wait.
[93:05.76]He's not aware.
[93:06.72]No, I'm not.
[93:08.10]Can I kill this thing?
[93:14.39]Shout out to all the weirdos who like Fanta Green Apple.
[93:20.46]Yeah, that does make you a weirdo, doesn't it?
[93:30.59]That is a weirdo barometer, you're right.
[93:39.65]Green Apple Fanta.
[93:45.98]Yeah, um... Green Apple Fanta, I don't think I've even had it before.
[93:54.71]But I know it probably tastes like a liquid, cold version of a Jolly Rancher.
[94:01.81]The Green Apple Jolly Rancher.
[94:11.07]You know that exact flavor I'm talking about?
[94:12.88]But I feel like it's thick and syrupy and shit, and I wouldn't want it in my mouth.
[94:18.34]I gotta find a gold key.
[94:19.56]What do we open?
[94:28.94]What do we open here?
[94:29.86]Ooh.
[94:33.61]There's a timer.
[94:34.01]There's a timer on this?
[94:38.85]Gold door.
[94:41.75]Where do I go from here?
[94:48.24]No, there's no time around this.
[94:50.84]Fanta is exotic?
[94:55.06]I don't know about Fanta exotic.
[95:00.28]Wait, I want to get that right here.
[95:03.85]I missed it.
[95:04.79]It's like I was trying to go around it.
[95:05.83]Alright, so where the fuck do I go?
[95:12.57]Over there?
[95:14.51]There?
[95:21.86]I guess I could go up here.
[95:23.40]Is this where I came from?
[95:25.06]I think I go... Where?
[95:31.86]No?
[95:33.16]This way?
[95:34.02]No?
[95:35.20]No?
[95:36.06]No.
[95:38.59]Ow, where am I going?
[95:39.35]This way?
[95:48.07]And this is out the back entrance.
[95:54.37]Wait.
[95:54.59]I can go up here.
[95:56.19]Did that move shit around on the sides?
[95:57.69]I think it did.
[95:58.17]Yeah, it did.
[95:58.59]Had to.
[96:00.69]Yeah, it moved a bunch of shit all over the place.
[96:04.26]We're good.
[96:08.32]This is the second bonus stream?
[96:13.06]Uh, it kind of feels like this whole week so far has been, uh, just wait bonus stream.
[96:21.49]That's been the first couple streams this week.
[96:27.85]What was that noise?
[96:32.77]This is not a canon week.
[96:35.70]No, this week is not.
[96:37.18]You're right, it's not canon.
[96:40.30]Well, I mean, yeah, you could... No, it was, it was.
[96:46.18]We played with Joel today.
[96:47.38]And he was very, very angry.
[96:55.14]Those who are lost never look upwards.
[96:59.16]Except for you, because you're playing the game.
[97:02.62]That guy hurts.
[97:08.76]We heard Joel scream today.
[97:11.42]Screaming.
[97:32.18]So we- ooooh, I don't really like this weapon.
[97:36.10]I don't like this flavor.
[97:39.98]See, if this thing is, um... If this is like a green apple... This is like a crystal-like rock candy.
[97:49.72]Crystal rock candy green apple.
[97:52.69]This thing... It's just like that sour paste, like blue raspberry sour gel that you suck on.
[97:59.85]This stuff is gross.
[98:03.98]I would eat this.
[98:06.30]If it came down to it, I would.
[98:08.43]I can't press this button?
[98:13.17]Blue raspberry is the best.
[98:14.15]Yeah, but not much that, like, gross gel, like, oil that they put sugar in.
[98:20.91]And whip it up.
[98:25.18]They, like, use cartilage or whatever the hell it is.
[98:29.78]Can I get up?
[98:30.22]Ooh, there's the key.
[98:31.20]Shit.
[98:31.32]Shit.
[98:36.72]Nothing to do.
[98:37.68]I can't get up there.
[98:38.28]This looks breakable.
[98:40.14]Can I blow this up?
[98:42.94]That looks so breakable though, doesn't it?
[98:44.36]What are my thoughts on sour candy?
[98:49.83]I'm not a big fan of it.
[98:52.55]It's... Mm-mm.
[98:56.57]I gotta undo that.
[99:06.04]Because sour is cool, but after you eat sour candy, you kind of just feel bad for at least 10-20 minutes after you eat it.
[99:21.72]Something feels off.
[99:30.55]The sides of my tongue Underneath my tongue at the base of kind of where my jaw is connecting my tongue to my in my mouth It's sore like I did a workout inside of my mouth If I eat a really sour shit for more than a few minutes straight Holy fuck this level is confusing
[99:59.73]Uh... I think... Can I jump from...?
[100:06.16]This isn't here.
[100:08.16]Then we go... We just keep going up.
[100:13.03]Fuck.
[100:13.53]Don't kill me.
[100:14.57]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[100:16.43]Stuck in the wall.
[100:17.05]Stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck.
[100:29.03]Well, there's health here.
[100:29.75]Good.
[100:35.40]Of course you did that.
[100:36.50]You fucking idiot.
[100:38.48]I don't even remember how to get up there.
[100:39.59]Low game.
[100:57.74]Alright.
[100:59.00]Where is this person?
[100:59.58]Invisible?
[101:00.24]Where are you?
[101:02.46]Oh, fucking stupid, fucking dumb idiot, fucking idiot, fucking dumb idiot.
[101:08.95]Now what did that do?
[101:12.07]The protectors cannot stand weapons of chaos.
[101:16.89]They can't stand it.
[101:25.26]Okay, I can't get that.
[101:33.41]Now what?
[101:37.62]This is one of those puzzle levels, ain't it?
[101:42.94]Well, people spawned down here, so I think that's where I need to go.
[101:46.66]Right?
[101:47.04]No.
[101:47.40]What?
[101:49.78]Where the fuck?
[101:55.86]What if that button activated?
[101:56.98]Not bad.
[102:03.50]Did something else open down here?
[102:07.70]Oh, here we go.
[102:12.11]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[102:12.93]I wanna get up there!
[102:13.91]No, I don't.
[102:14.21]Give me that gold key.
[102:15.41]Got it.
[102:21.39]Holy shit.
[102:23.15]That's a lot of people.
[102:27.55]Blind streamer misses button.
[102:29.93]No, he didn't.
[102:31.23]What the fuck was that?
[102:40.08]Alright, I gotta get out of this.
[102:41.26]I got the gold key now.
[102:43.41]Let's go.
[102:46.69]Back up.
[102:47.97]Yeah.
[102:53.31]Damn it.
[102:53.57]I have to beat it up there, don't I?
[102:56.41]I gotta get up there.
[102:57.23]Go, go, go.
[102:57.63]I don't know which way it is.
[102:58.35]I don't remember.
[102:59.35]I don't know.
[103:01.29]This way.
[103:06.46]I missed it.
[103:13.49]Have you ever tried spicy Skittles?
[103:15.11]I don't know.
[103:16.20]I've not.
[103:16.62]Alright, well I know where this is.
[103:20.58]No.
[103:22.80]Just go back down.
[103:24.38]Press the button.
[103:26.91]Beat it up there.
[103:35.75]Good.
[103:37.45]Look!
[103:38.26]I'm smart.
[103:39.88]Sometimes.
[103:46.93]Stop making me hungry.
[103:48.71]I think... If you... Don't talk.
[103:50.93]Where do I go?
[103:51.56]No, fucking goddammit!
[103:52.76]I started talking and I lost my opportunity.
[103:54.72]Now I have to do this again.
[103:55.40]There's a little sliver right there.
[104:05.54]So smart.
[104:07.80]Hey, distra... You can be smart and get distracted.
[104:15.02]Being distracted does not equal low intelligence.
[104:18.86]It means I'm over here, and then I'm over here, and then I'm over here, I'm over there, and then I'm over there.
[104:32.13]Is there nothing up here?
[104:48.56]Now what?
[104:52.81]Freedom?
[104:53.35]I can't jump that high.
[105:01.51]I'm gonna go out to the main area.
[105:02.50]Oh, I got the key, I got the key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key, key.
[105:07.27]I got the key.
[105:08.90]The key is over there.
[105:09.82]You press the button.
[105:10.80]It takes you up.
[105:11.62]You get to go across.
[105:13.66]I remember I got the key.
[105:14.84]Don't worry.
[105:15.38]Here we go.
[105:27.87]Open.
[105:28.87]Good.
[105:34.36]There's the sword.
[105:35.34]Nice.
[105:46.18]I really do like this the best.
[105:48.34]I like the green apple shards wand.
[105:53.15]It's the most concentrated.
[105:56.21]What the fuck was that?
[106:02.81]It's just super concentrated damage.
[106:04.37]Can I walk on this floor?
[106:05.31]Can I?
[106:08.31]Nope.
[106:11.15]I mean, I can, but not for very long.
[106:12.77]Get out of the way!
[106:24.12]No!
[106:27.68]No shit, you're spawning.
[106:33.62]Get out of here.
[106:38.80]Keep scaling it.
[106:44.06]Is that enough?
[106:47.35]I gotta get it.
[106:48.95]I have to try to get that.
[106:52.31]Yeah, I needed to.
[106:54.21]Run out of ammo.
[107:07.55]I gotta get that health, too.
[107:09.81]Look, I'm gonna play on warrior mode.
[107:18.39]And there's nothing else up here?
[107:19.45]I can... It's probably a secret room.
[107:22.83]Cool.
[107:23.97]Very, very cool.
[107:24.81]I didn't bring... Oh.
[107:26.19]I don't know why I decided I didn't bring... What?
[107:29.09]Like an underwear?
[107:30.59]Towel?
[107:30.91]What am I talking about?
[107:33.30]Jerma, you can't just... Jerma, I... What?
[107:35.66]What's wrong?
[107:37.61]Through my eye.
[107:38.35]Haha.
[107:38.81]Just kidding.
[107:39.25]What are you doing?
[107:49.58]Unless what?
[107:50.26]Unless... Unless... Haha.
[107:56.33]Are you doing that thing?
[107:57.65]You're doing that thing.
[108:01.39]Now I know.
[108:02.27]I'm aware now.
[108:12.94]Silver key there's the silver door but wait Fire makes the vine creature stronger, so don't use fire use electricity The way is clear yet murky Oh, where's that going
[108:37.06]Alright, uh anyone know what that is that's out in the main hall and it's connected over there and I don't know I'll find it Oh shit Auto flame It's auto flame
[109:06.67]I wanted to ask a question.
[109:09.00]Does anybody have any experience with dog ancestry DNA kits?
[109:17.22]Are they real?
[109:27.39]Or is it just pretend?
[109:36.55]Sounds like bullshit.
[109:38.31]My co-worker used them and talked about it for months.
[109:41.50]No one knows.
[109:42.84]Human ancestry kits aren't real.
[109:44.82]No, I'm talking dog ancestry kits.
[109:47.22]I'm, by the way, I don't see the appeal.
[109:52.82]I don't, for me, I don't want to send in my, like, saliva or my blood to some company.
[110:02.05]And then they have a genetic DNA profile?
[110:05.73]They have my genetic code?
[110:08.57]What?
[110:09.25]Why?
[110:09.91]Are they collecting this info?
[110:10.85]What are they doing with it?
[110:11.73]What are you doing with my info?
[110:20.46]Twitch has that already.
[110:23.30]You think that Twitch has my genetic DNA makeup?
[110:33.68]What?
[110:34.08]What do you mean?
[110:38.44]You can request the destruction of DNA.
[110:45.68]The path before you must be- you must ascend.
[110:48.18]Oh, fuck.
[110:51.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[110:52.84]I'm fine.
[111:03.04]White fire makes the foes stronger.
[111:17.76]Monka.
[111:19.94]Monka.
[111:31.03]Should I have my own MonkaS emote?
[111:34.95]Would you guys use it?
[111:49.62]If it was called... Jerma S.
[112:01.51]There we go.
[112:03.23]All the way up!
[112:12.38]You already have one and nobody uses it.
[112:14.00]Yeah, because the emote doesn't look bright.
[112:15.86]It's like tiny.
[112:17.54]It looks strange.
[112:24.83]Plus there's a close-up of it already that's another emote.
[112:32.77]That fear emote and Mars, they're more surprised than they are scared.
[112:40.99]Oh, I'm dead.
[112:43.61]That was a disaster.
[112:45.27]Wait, I have to press that button.
[112:46.73]What?
[112:47.29]Hold on.
[112:57.00]Oh, goddammit.
[113:04.64]Are you going to die?
[113:05.24]What the heck?
[113:09.07]Alright, this is a failsafe.
[113:09.87]Good.
[113:17.33]I thought it was a... I thought it was a straight run.
[113:22.10]I didn't see that there was no ground.
[113:29.76]Okay.
[113:30.62]It was blending in.
[113:35.91]nice keep going keep going keep going keep going pretty good spill joke whoa oh painful this is not a place I really want to be fighting anybody
[114:05.93]I need health.

[114:21.54]Shit.
[114:24.54]Thank you.
[114:26.04]The giant!
[114:30.13]The giant protects the way.
[114:32.27]Get a mini-boss?
[114:36.71]Something like that?
[114:43.43]Who's left?
[114:45.17]The giant.
[114:46.11]Is there a giant?
[114:48.23]Oh, hi.
[115:12.97]Around the corner.
[115:13.79]Yeah, there's a giant.
[115:16.57]There's a giant.
[115:17.11]There's a giant.
[115:17.69]I wonder if I should use explosives?
[115:31.11]Damn it!
[115:32.29]Alright, explosives.
[115:33.71]Did he just kill himself?
[115:42.06]I think he just killed himself.
[115:44.14]He did a huge wind-up and just instantly died.
[115:49.62]I think he threw that into the wall and fucking killed him.
[116:00.87]How you guys doing tonight?
[116:02.25]When was the last time I checked in?
[116:04.67]How is everybody?

[116:46.28]Glad to have you.
[116:49.84]Thanks for watching.
[116:51.08]Oh boy.
[116:51.60]Um...
[117:00.59]God, I love this thing.
[117:04.66]The bubble gun is the best.
[117:05.72]The path opens from below.
[117:07.88]I'm sure it does.
[117:08.72]And this is a big scene here.
[117:10.36]Ooh.
[117:13.20]We gotta go.
[117:24.93]Dead.
[117:29.41]So that one opens and I go to there.
[117:34.30]Yeah, I just grinded him up.
[117:38.76]I feel like I'm playing Overwatch again.
[117:40.24]This kind of hurts my eyes.
[117:52.35]One more.
[117:53.11]Did I not get the other one?
[117:58.07]Rock and stone torture.
[118:05.64]Get ammo.
[118:06.44]Yeah, I need ammo.
[118:07.14]You're right.
[118:07.68]I do.
[118:08.10]I do.
[118:08.36]I do.
[118:08.66]You're right.
[118:08.94]Alright, everybody in chat.
[118:18.99]Everybody in chat, do your best Winston impression.
[118:20.71]Go.
[118:23.93]Imagination is the essence of discovery.
[118:27.22]It's mine.
[118:36.92]Alright, now do... what?
[118:50.65]Holy shit.
[118:52.15]A huge raid just came in.
[118:56.18]Uh... Boxbox.
[119:00.28]Boxbox is raided with like 3,000 fucking people.
[119:05.48]What's up?
[119:06.76]What's going on?
[119:07.72]How are ya?
[119:12.67]Welcome to the stream!
[119:16.25]Hopefully it didn't say I was playing Halo Reach.
[119:18.69]Did it say I was playing Halo?
[119:19.75]Uh oh.
[119:22.09]Boxbox, did it say I was playing Halo?
[119:28.71]Impressions.
[119:31.09]No, thanks a lot.
[119:32.45]Welcome, everybody.
[119:34.94]Whatever you're doing on your stream, hope you had a good time.
[119:39.14]We're playing AMID EVIL right now, which is a first-person shooter, old-school indie... I almost said RPG.
[119:46.77]It's not an RPG.
[119:47.81]It's about moving fast.
[119:50.13]And if you've ever played the game Dusk, it's by the same publisher as Dusk.
[119:54.16]It's not Halo Reach.
[119:55.58]It's not Halo Reach.
[119:56.56]No, it was.
[119:58.72]Until the person I was playing with abandoned me.
[120:03.50]And now I'm sad.
[120:07.20]But, yeah.
[120:07.76]This is a medieval.
[120:08.36]We're like, eh, maybe halfway through the game.
[120:10.38]Maybe something like that.
[120:17.17]Alright, now where do I go?
[120:18.23]Where do I go?
[120:19.45]But, yeah, huge thanks, BoxBox.
[120:21.19]That's a fucking lot of people.
[120:22.45]Welcome, everybody.
[120:24.35]I'm ready.
[120:25.73]I activated the two buttons.
[120:29.61]I missed a button.
[120:30.23]Oh, fuck.
[120:31.95]I was walking in circles.
[120:33.44]What do I do?
[120:34.52]How about over here?
[120:36.66]Did I just go all the way to the back of the beginning?
[120:38.44]No, I didn't.
[120:38.96]Did I?
[120:39.50]Yes, I did.
[120:40.32]No, I didn't.
[120:46.32]I'm going all the way back.
[120:47.74]Alright, go back.
[120:52.59]Follower only mode.
[120:56.25]Well, yeah, follower-only, but that's, that's just, that's... What do you mean follower-only mode, LOL?
[121:04.79]Wait, what?
[121:05.51]I... Alright, how, I don't even remember how the fuck I get back.
[121:12.30]Over there?
[121:13.04]It's, yeah, it's a little tiny little thing.
[121:15.12]No, this is, alright.
[121:20.80]Alright, I'm paying attention.
[121:21.84]Time to pay attention to the video game.
[121:22.82]I'll see you in 3, 2, 1, go!
[121:26.27]It's the other way.
[121:26.75]It's this way.
[121:30.71]Got it.
[121:34.31]Joel turned your brain into mush.
[121:37.64]Ah, there is another one.
[121:38.34]You're right.
[121:42.32]Have a grenade.
[121:52.43]5G.
[121:53.61]It's that tower.
[121:57.73]Alright, now what opened from that button?
[122:06.70]Back in the way I came?
[122:08.22]I don't know.
[122:12.84]Ah, there it is.
[122:13.34]Okay, cool.
[122:14.40]That's it.
[122:15.10]Done.
[122:18.17]You should get a 5G emote already.
[122:26.67]What would it be?
[122:29.09]Alright, I have it on warrior mode.
[122:30.71]This is gonna be interesting.
[122:31.51]I actually have to be good.
[122:47.31]Didn't get hit.
[122:47.75]Good.
[122:47.93]That's good.
[122:48.25]That's good.
[122:48.55]That's good.
[122:48.99]Alright.
[122:49.37]I need a weapon.
[122:53.43]Just have it be three squares?
[122:57.80]So, turned off follower only?
[123:00.19]Alright, alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait, alright.
[123:01.55]Hey, uh, a mod, turn off follower only for five minutes.
[123:16.12]Turn off what?
[123:16.98]Follower only?
[123:17.86]The follower only mode?
[123:27.55]Oh.
[123:28.63]Hey, there they are!
[123:29.75]Hey!
[123:32.53]Welcome!
[123:35.13]Look at that.
[123:35.53]Look at all those box-box emotes!
[123:47.46]Don't follow me.
[123:48.74]Hey, thanks for the raid.
[123:49.96]All of you have been... have a muzzle on.
[123:55.95]Everyone's just trying to be like...
[123:59.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:59.70]Never mind.
[124:01.28]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[124:13.15]But yeah.
[124:14.07]What's the emote?
[124:16.18]There's a cool emote.
[124:26.30]Sword!
[124:28.90]Somebody's behind me, somebody's behind me.
[124:31.02]I like this level, but it's, um... It's the verticality that causes me issues.
[124:36.93]I know I said that's why I like the level, but you can like something and not like it at the same time.
[124:41.69]Andross?
[124:42.77]What the fuck?
[124:53.76]No, I keep trying to switch.
[124:55.28]That's not going to work.
[125:01.06]New enemy type.
[125:02.60]Fuck.
[125:03.62]Dude, there's a new enemy type.
[125:05.27]Fuck.
[125:10.11]Why does Jerma always embarrass us in front of other streamers?
[125:12.61]I don't know.
[125:23.08]I should go down.
[125:26.91]Is it gonna hurt?
[125:30.19]I gotta lodge out.
[125:34.57]Get out of the water.
[125:36.31]Why can I not get out of the water?
[125:38.95]Get out of the water.
[125:40.54]Jump out of the water.
[125:56.93]Can I be cool?
[125:58.61]For once.
[125:59.09]Alright, how do I do that?
[126:03.25]Alright, so you guys gotta give me some coaching here.
[126:05.81]So next time there's a raid that comes in, what's the first thing that I should say?
[126:10.78]What do you think?
[126:14.48]What do you think is a good approach?
[126:15.64]What should I say?
[126:16.52]Turn the facecam on immediately.
[126:26.56]Can you imagine?
[126:29.08]If I didn't have a facecam on and all of a sudden a raid came in, a bunch of people came in, like some of you guys that came over.
[126:33.35]And I immediately just turned on the facecam and I'm like, hey, hey!
[126:37.11]And just pretended like it was on the whole time.
[126:39.15]That's just... Yeah, for those of you that don't know, this is a... I don't do facecam on this stream.
[126:51.88]Unless it's my birthday.
[126:54.10]We do a facecam birthday stream every year.
[126:57.23]And that stream is 24 hours.
[127:00.47]I do a 24 hour birthday facecam stream.
[127:04.79]And I read letters that people send me.
[127:08.41]I get a stack of them.
[127:12.63]Alright, I gotta get up there.
[127:18.47]You can't even stream for 6.
[127:19.57]I'd like that person to take a look at the data.
[127:25.11]My average stream time is between six and a half to seven and a half hours.
[127:28.11]I'd like them to check the data.
[127:29.25]You could just check on that data.
[127:39.76]Should I go back down?
[127:40.36]Wait a minute.
[127:51.33]Ah, there's a button over here, right.
[128:00.20]But, what does this do for me?
[128:05.95]I went up this elevator already.
[128:07.11]The visage of fire is not to be trifled with.
[128:13.39]What does that do for me?
[128:14.13]I don't know.
[128:21.23]Any idiots here that can help me?
[128:34.60]Did I?
[128:35.04]What?
[128:35.60]Remind me, did I pick up a key?
[128:41.72]Alright, well at least I got that.
[128:48.04]Is there a way I can check my keys?
[128:52.34]Is it the silver key, maybe?
[128:53.96]I just don't remember.
[128:56.59]There are no idiots here, I know.
[128:58.71]Sucks sometimes, man.
[128:59.67]I just wish there was, like, stupid people here.
[129:01.69]Besides me.
[129:03.29]Sucks.
[129:05.46]Silver key?
[129:08.38]Go back in the hole.
[129:12.61]I could go this way.
[129:23.42]Show the slap clip.
[129:25.26]I'm surprised you guys weren't quicker on that one.
[129:29.56]That's usually the first thing that happens.
[129:38.23]Finally, my favorite item.
[129:40.16]Yes.
[129:46.20]They spammed us like 30 times, did they?
[129:47.98]Oh, shit.
[129:50.82]That's what I get for not paying attention to anything efficient here.
[129:53.72]I haven't saved in a long time.
[130:14.91]No, don't touch that.
[130:17.27]Alright, so this is... probably get depressive.
[130:19.99]Ah, there's the key right there.
[130:21.25]Damn it.
[130:22.05]Alright, how do I open that?
[130:25.59]Can I swim up, maybe?
[130:27.47]Well, I'm just... I got it.
[130:28.95]Whatever.
[130:29.29]There we go.
[130:34.37]But what about down here?
[130:36.37]Where's this light coming from?
[130:39.37]It's a fish.
[130:43.46]No filter.
[130:44.18]What...
[130:48.63]You guys have to keep Link in ship for my birthday.
[131:00.45]Alright, made it.
[131:00.95]Wait.
[131:07.85]I need the gold key.
[131:09.33]Ah!
[131:10.19]I need the gold key to get in here.
[131:12.51]I need that key.
[131:13.19]I gotta... There's probably an activator I can do over here.
[131:17.60]Scream if you see any buttons.
[131:23.35]The reflection of water only shows the surface.
[131:28.81]No shit.
[131:39.45]Glass will cut you.
[131:42.45]I know.
[131:45.33]Dammit.
[131:45.61]I don't see anything.
[131:47.10]Do you guys see anything?
[131:53.40]Don't get smart on me.
[131:54.38]What?
[131:54.52]What are you talking about?
[131:56.26]I don't see anything.
[131:59.43]I can't go back down.
[132:00.47]Where's the... deep end?
[132:08.90]Oh, there it is.
[132:10.97]I just got the... I got the key.
[132:13.51]I picked it up.
[132:14.41]I got a hat.
[132:18.51]Alright.
[132:20.99]I would not have found that.
[132:21.97]We would have been here for a long time.
[132:23.32]Alright, open it.
[132:44.49]Are we still in- is follower only mode off?
[132:47.87]Let me put it back on.
[132:48.60]I need to make a joke quick.
[133:00.63]What do I do?
[133:01.05]Where should I stay?
[133:06.43]Turn off slo- turn- okay.
[133:07.99]Turn off follower only, turn off slow mode.
[133:16.19]Now you're asking too much.
[133:17.71]You're asking way too much.
[133:31.31]Wait.
[133:32.69]Wait, is Anarchy on again?
[133:36.05]No slow mode, no follower mode.
[133:41.16]This is dangerous.
[133:42.74]Dangerous waters we're crossing here.
[133:46.34]I'm gonna die.
[133:48.82]Oh, by the way, this is on hard.
[133:55.48]Those of you that are wondering.
[134:04.29]Give me more.
[134:04.75]Alright, what am I gonna eat today?
[134:09.39]What do you think?
[134:12.07]The first thing that somebody says in chat, I will eat it.
[134:15.21]As long as it's actually edible.
[134:17.05]Anarchy.
[134:17.57]Can't eat that.
[134:21.54]Someone said pizza.
[134:22.32]Nah, I'm not into it.
[134:26.55]Wings.
[134:27.05]Eh, nah, I'm not into it.
[134:30.95]Need a ghost pepper.
[134:31.65]Nope.
[134:38.69]Big chicken.
[134:41.95]No, no, no, no.
[134:42.61]Nothing.
[134:42.89]No fast food today.
[134:43.83]Nothing.
[134:44.15]No fast food.
[134:44.69]I don't want that.
[134:53.25]Sushi?
[134:55.07]No.
[134:56.40]No, no.
[134:57.66]No raw food.
[134:58.42]Not right now.
[135:05.28]Low-made and general chicken.
[135:07.93]You're almost there.
[135:08.75]That's pretty... You're almost there.
[135:10.29]That's close.
[135:24.36]Pad Thai?
[135:27.60]I would say that that is probably accurate.
[135:30.82]Very accurate.
[135:31.62]Yeah.
[135:32.42]That's accurate.
[135:34.84]Nice work.
[135:45.33]Yeah, excellent job.
[135:46.97]That sounds fantastic.
[135:51.03]Oh, I can already see it on the plate steaming.
[135:54.80]It's so hot.
[135:57.34]When I just slurp up the noodles, they whack me all over the fucking mouth and it's like fucking burning me.
[136:02.34]But it's worth it.
[136:06.50]I can't go through there.
[136:24.53]I don't think there's anything else.
[136:25.67]I want to jump around on these things.
[136:26.69]There's got to be a button to press.
[136:28.81]Down here.
[136:30.21]Didn't do this yet, did I?
[136:31.97]Well, I guess we're going up.
[136:33.53]No, we're not.
[136:34.13]What is this for?
[136:37.75]Button?
[136:46.44]What is that for?
[136:53.46]Yeah, I'm gonna show up on stream tomorrow with just these small, thin, red lines all around my mouth.
[137:01.86]And those are just like noodle burn marks from me just going too fast and eating it when it's too hot.
[137:17.42]That way.
[137:19.78]That way, that way, that way.
[137:20.80]No?
[137:23.02]Yeah, I'm just going in here.
[137:24.28]Fuck it.
[137:26.28]That moves.
[137:33.38]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[137:35.02]It's my birthday tomorrow, so we're gonna do a face cam tomorrow.
[137:37.60]Happy birthday.
[137:43.95]What is wrong with me?
[137:44.93]What's going on?
[137:45.41]Why am I getting hurt by it?
[137:47.11]Oh, it's fishes in here.
[137:55.23]Ooh, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[137:56.35]Give me this.
[137:56.85]Alright, three more to go, apparently.
[138:05.75]So where those are, I don't know.
[138:08.29]I know there's one up there.
[138:09.99]We can just go like this.
[138:14.25]Two more.
[138:15.43]There it is.
[138:21.16]One more.
[138:22.18]It's up there.
[138:27.47]Ah, you gotta get that one exact, don't you?
[138:34.19]Why is it cake?
[138:40.51]Nope, I have to get this.
[138:49.38]Damn it.
[138:49.64]It's gonna be perfect.
[138:54.68]There it is.
[138:55.64]Hooray.
[138:57.94]So sequence complete, that means... what exactly?
[139:05.41]We want ice cream instead.
[139:06.55]This is turned.
[139:13.01]Oh.
[139:13.79]That's what that did.
[139:14.73]Cool.
[139:17.54]Turned on the fountain.
[139:22.06]That'd be a really expensive birthday.
[139:25.48]Wasn't there a TV show about exactly what we're describing?
[139:27.80]Having like 5,000 people go to a birthday party with a bunch of stuff and cake and like ponies to ride and... There was a thing about this.
[139:37.64]There was a TV show.
[139:46.13]It's called, like, My Big Birthday.
[139:48.35]What was it?
[139:48.75]It was on, like, MTV or something.
[139:51.47]And these people spent, like, seven or eight million dollars on their kids' birthday parties.
[140:02.80]My... It was My... Yeah, My Sweet Sixteen.
[140:05.08]Right.
[140:07.06]That's what it was.
[140:07.67]Ha.
[140:16.79]Oh, I did it in the same fucking spot.
[140:19.19]Concentrate, damn it.
[140:24.41]Yeah, then celebrities would come perform at their birthday parties in a private concert.
[140:32.17]I'll tell you this right now.
[140:34.85]There's no, I would never, I would never go, okay, into somebody's house and do like a private Jerma stream.
[140:46.71]I think that would be sort of strange.
[140:52.63]How would that work?
[140:53.66]Would I just go in your house and set up a computer and just stream from your house?
[141:00.14]You would.
[141:00.48]What if you were paid?
[141:01.44]No, I don't think I could do that.
[141:02.30]That would be fucking weird.
[141:06.93]But where do you come in?
[141:10.14]What's your play on this?
[141:12.55]What is this?
[141:14.19]Do you watch the stream from a different room?
[141:18.65]You just have your iPad and you're just watching it from another room?
[141:22.41]Alright, well how much money are you going to give me for this?
[141:34.24]What should I be charging for that?
[141:44.72]Five thousand dollars.
[141:49.51]I'd rather you just buy a car.
[141:52.57]For your... Just go buy a car.
[142:06.36]A five thousand dollar car.
[142:10.34]Hey, you could probably get like an old Honda Civic.
[142:14.20]Those things could have like two or three hundred thousand miles on them and still run like they just came out of the factory.
[142:21.93]I would know.
[142:27.24]Alright, here's how I would do that.
[142:30.71]I would do that for a $5,000 McDonald's gift card.
[142:35.53]And those of you that are asking, I can't, that's impossible.
[142:37.87]You have to call and special custom order that.
[142:41.85]And if they won't do it for you, you have to find a way.
[142:46.88]You have to call corporate and somehow put $5,000 on a McDonald's gift card.
[143:02.36]I'm dead.
[143:03.34]Very soon.
[143:09.46]My civic has 208,000 miles on it or something, right?
[143:13.47]You get it.
[143:14.83]You get it.
[143:23.01]Did I fall off in the worst possible spot?
[143:25.57]I did, didn't I?
[143:39.48]What's that?
[143:42.95]Oh, megalol ruined.
[143:46.15]The streamer owns a civic.
[143:47.55]Laugh out loud.
[143:49.79]That's not what you said.
[143:50.35]I'm paraphrasing.
[144:02.62]Ooh.
[144:03.26]Super.
[144:04.40]Good.
[144:06.58]Alright.
[144:06.94]Save it here.
[144:07.42]29 health.
[144:07.66]This is bad.
[144:14.76]Well, ask and you shall receive.
[144:23.40]Can this streamer drive a stick?
[144:24.90]No.
[144:26.66]And... Why would I want to?
[144:33.23]Let me demonstrate the life of a stick driver.
[144:41.20]imagine doing that for like two hours straight imagine you had imagine you was stuck in traffic for like three hours
[145:10.87]Everybody I've ever been in a car with that drove a stick?
[145:15.21]It's just like, it was a full-time job to drive that car.
[145:18.33]Guys, I have problems turning on the wipers in my car.
[145:23.94]You think I'd be able to drive a manual?
[145:29.12]I've driven the same car for a long time, and I still, still, when it rains...
[145:34.13]Which, uh, what setting does the, how do I go halfway so it only goes, the blades go up and down every, like, half second?
[145:39.56]I don't, I don't know.
[145:41.30]I'm just gonna guess until I get the way that I want it.
[145:45.57]You think I can handle a manual?
[146:04.11]Oh, he just direct hit me with that.
[146:05.43]Goddammit, that sucks.
[146:13.81]I headshot him.
[146:14.53]That's the only way to save me.
[146:27.04]You wanna know what I actually- I have actually a pet peeve for automobiles.
[146:30.54]Would you like to hear it?
[146:33.08]You guys want to hear it?
[146:34.32]Yeah!
[146:34.82]Okay, I'll tell you.
[146:36.95]So, when somebody has a horn that is not a regular horn.
[146:46.53]Everybody knows what a car horn sounds like.
[146:51.01]When you have a car horn that just goes like... Universal, everybody knows what that sound is.
[146:57.50]When somebody has a custom car horn...
[147:01.43]I've heard it.
[147:02.23]I feel like my car exploded when I hear somebody use a custom car horn if they're near me and it's like a It's just like something's hurt.
[147:11.20]I'm gonna get hurt or like It's like It freaks me the fuck out man, it scares the shit out of me
[147:33.76]And nobody's prepared for it.
[147:43.61]This one time I pulled up to a red light.
[147:46.49]And I'm not even kidding.
[147:50.93]The guy held his horn down and it was the PeeWee Herman lap.
[147:55.33]I don't even know how the fuck you did that.
[148:07.40]Fake.
[148:08.54]Fake.
[148:09.60]Fake.
[148:14.26]He left this place, but what?
[148:20.58]Holy shit, that is insane.
[148:24.23]Well, that wasn't the actual PB Herman laugh.
[148:26.09]No, okay, you got me.
[148:27.03]But it sounded like it.
[148:28.09]It was like... I can't even do it.
[148:33.11]It was like... Come on!
[148:35.63]Come on!
[148:37.05]It was crazy.
[148:37.83]It was like... And then they beeped it really quickly, so it was like... I was like, that's people Herman.
[148:51.68]Literally right next to me.
[149:00.48]Did I get some goddamn health?
[149:07.12]What if it was just PeeWee out the window?
[149:09.38]I don't know.
[149:13.49]Somebody's doing drive-by PeeWee Hermans?
[149:19.61]No, it was definitely their horn.
[149:21.79]And they may have had a regular horn that just sounded like shit.
[149:26.19]Or I may have dreamed this.
[149:28.31]I don't know.
[149:31.54]I got fucking dead.
[149:38.54]Holy shit, I didn't know you were here.
[149:51.19]Oh, I walked into it again.
[149:52.15]Damn it.
[150:01.31]Softlock?
[150:01.87]No.
[150:02.21]Just don't get hit.
[150:18.85]Now here's a follow-up question to those of you that have any idea.
[150:21.81]Are there any laws or regulations on what you can and cannot have for a custom car horn, if you spent the money to have one?
[150:32.28]Could you have, like for instance, like a Homer Simpson?
[150:38.00]Like a... Could you have that?
[150:41.21]Actually, yes.
[150:42.47]So, in what legislation did they have to write down...
[150:47.56]Awuga is okay.
[150:49.19]And, like, da-na-na-na-na is okay.
[150:53.85]That's written down somewhere.
[150:56.41]Like, submarine going down?
[151:01.45]Somebody had to write that, right?
[151:02.42]So what are other ones that are illegally allowed to have?
[151:08.84]The Awuga Clause.
[151:13.10]A police siren.
[151:15.12]Uh, that's not
[151:18.62]Why?
[151:18.88]Why?
[151:19.02]It's just my custom car horn.
[151:21.28]I just want everyone around me to think there's some fucking emergency.
[151:27.72]You can't have a train horn.
[151:32.19]What did I open?
[151:33.29]That came down.
[151:34.09]Something came down.
[151:35.11]That.
[151:39.87]I wonder what is allowed.
[151:40.69]I need to look this up after the stream.
[151:42.97]What custom car horns are allowed?
[151:45.25]And are there only two of them?
[151:50.12]Wait, every motor vehicle when operated by a highway must be equipped with... I didn't see it.
[151:59.64]Look up right now.
[152:03.27]Oh, you actually mean look it up right now, not look up right.
[152:06.59]Okay.
[152:10.87]What is legal for a custom car horn?
[152:17.84]Existing law require motor vehicle when operated upon a highway to be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of no less than 200 feet, but prohibits a horn from emitting an unreasonably loud or harsh sound.
[152:33.83]This does this does not say anything about Homer Simpson.
[152:39.41]Laws on car horns.
[152:40.65]Hold on.
[152:45.96]Okay, so the law today.
[152:52.10]Yeah, yeah.
[152:53.32]It is illegal to use a car horn for any purpose other than to express warning.
[152:57.93]In the state of Washington, for instance, the law reads, the driver of a motor vehicle shall, when reasonably necessary to ensure safe operation, give audible warning with his horn, but shall not otherwise use such a horn when upon a highway.
[153:08.77]Well, this is bullshit, because drive by literally any local politician group of people holding signs.
[153:17.48]Yeah!
[153:18.80]Hey!
[153:19.38]Hey!
[153:22.63]Yeah, I agree with you.
[153:23.95]That's not real.
[153:25.47]It has to be on there somewhere.
[153:29.26]Penalties.
[153:36.02]Do you know anyone who has ever been busted for honking?
[153:38.38]Probably not.
[153:38.96]Can you get arrested for using your horn when you're not supposed to?
[153:42.99]Where's the Homer Simpson line, though?
[153:44.61]Custom car horns.
[153:47.41]Can you replace a car horn?
[153:51.73]No, this is how to fix a broken car.
[153:53.71]Is this even on the books?
[154:02.31]I don't know about arrested.
[154:03.33]This is important though.
[154:07.88]Are train horns illegal in my state?
[154:13.92]There isn't one.
[154:14.48]As long as it isn't extremely loud.
[154:15.96]Yeah, as long as it's used to alert others.
[154:29.52]If you're impersonating emergency vehicles or breaking sound laws, then yeah.
[154:33.72]Okay.
[154:34.58]But what if I had a perfectly legal sound audible level of... Let's say... Gordon Ramsay saying, like, fuck off.
[154:48.53]Is that... Is that, like, is that a loophole?
[154:57.38]you could argue it but a cop might stop you alright where do we oh this way this way this way up I can't go through what alright I gotta pay attention no more car horns what if it was what if you did what if you did the Dark Souls hey hey
[155:32.41]and by the way why this is important this is important discussion why is there only a horn to say look out and why is that not like a you go ahead or a hi or a be careful how come there's only one horn why this shouldn't be like two or three different horns
[155:58.04]like a gentler one that's instead of being like it's like and that means something that's not like a hard horn like hey you can go ahead you go first or your your brights are on yeah just something that's softer and nicer where the fuck am I going um alright I think down here there's a fish in there
[156:26.77]Flash flash your lights, but you could distract somebody that way if it was very clear that like the Was something very light and like oh, hey you turn your lights on or Where should I go Go to bed
[157:02.97]Scream out your window.
[157:06.27]No, enough people do that already.
[157:15.15]I'm turned around here.
[157:15.93]I gotta go the right way.
[157:16.99]Alright, found it.
[157:18.09]Okay, found it.
[157:18.63]It's like people yelling at each other and screaming out the window and shit.
[157:30.28]Well, that didn't solve anything.
[157:33.52]You're never going to see that person ever again.
[157:35.36]You'll never see that person again.
[157:40.80]Like, you know, you're a fucking idiot, you know that?
[157:43.93]Okay, I'll never see you.
[157:45.45]I will never see you again.
[157:46.67]Like, I don't... That carries no weight on me.
[157:56.59]See... See you in court.
[158:02.99]Those doors are gonna open.
[158:21.18]People behind the wheel.
[158:22.78]Something happens.
[158:23.64]People go- people go fucking nuts when they're, like, operating the car.
[158:28.10]We already talked about, like, the speed thing.
[158:32.26]But let's refresh, for those of you that weren't here for the class.
[158:37.12]When people go, like, 20 miles per hour over the speed limit, and they get to the same red light as you, it's just like, I wish there was a horn for, like, like, told you so.
[158:50.31]Like, oh, look how far that got you.
[158:52.92]Why can't there be a horn that everybody knows is, look how far that got you.
[158:58.28]I would love it.
[159:14.21]Or I had to like change lanes like... Rip around you in a... Let me drive around.
[159:21.49]Oh, is that your car?
[159:23.86]At the same red light as me.
[159:26.58]And I'm driving normally.
[159:29.40]I imagine that person just sitting behind the wheel, just gripping the wheel going like... Fuck!
[159:33.88]Fuck!
[159:40.27]I feel like those people don't want red lights.
[159:42.69]Why can't I just drive through this?
[159:45.67]I just want to just let me go.
[159:46.97]I don't care.
[159:50.10]And then like, they just blow a fucking snot rocket like in the bottom of their own car.
[159:54.88]That's what I pictured.
[159:57.62]And they're trying to get out the window.
[159:58.88]They rolled the window down.
[159:59.50]They're trying to blow a fucking snot rocket out the window and they miss and they hit the same spot where the handle is for the door that they've hit 50 times already.
[160:09.06]And there's just stains there from them trying to do that.
[160:14.51]gotta go fast oh there it is oh there it is oh I gotta go fast alright hold that thought you have the rovers living in your head rent free
[160:40.21]I don't know, man.
[160:40.95]I'm telling you, something happens to people when they, like, get behind the fucking wheel.
[160:47.35]And I feel like that same person, if you were to bring this up to them in a conversation about, like, and you don't know that they're, like, one of these, like, crazy drivers, they would say the same shit.
[160:56.99]They'd be like, yeah, yeah, I really hate that.
[160:58.67]I really don't like people's speed and value and scream out the window and blow snot rockets.
[161:03.38]It's just, it's just not okay.
[161:05.62]It's not okay.
[161:07.84]You, you, it's you.
[161:20.72]Well, it must be you, because you're talking about it.
[161:24.38]I'm the one doing it.
[161:26.92]Hey, dude, I'm high as fuck.
[161:35.33]Alright.
[161:37.33]Good to see you.
[161:55.50]Oh right, I don't have my weapons.
[161:58.45]Did I save it yet?
[162:09.21]Live it in your head, rent free.
[162:14.79]Yeah.
[162:16.37]Because when it happens, you're like, what the fuck is wrong with this person?
[162:25.61]Dude, I have seen so many people drive around.
[162:30.52]Remember, remember the two places that I have been living in in my life.
[162:36.08]Boston, like East Coast, and then Las Vegas.
[162:41.40]I have seen so many people on the highway just fucking ripping around lanes, driving like a psycho.
[162:49.46]Screaming at each other.
[162:52.18]Cutting each other off.
[162:53.91]Playing cut-off tag with each other.
[163:01.33]It's like, what the fuck are you people doing?
[163:20.50]Have I... You've never had road rage before?
[163:23.31]I've been... I've had, like, my share of awe.
[163:25.09]I'm upset at something going on on the road.
[163:27.93]But never, like... I'm upset at something going on on the road.
[163:31.09]So now, let me accelerate to 30 miles per hour over the speed limit and overtake three people while I blow snot rockets on my windshield.
[163:42.14]Oh, fuck, I'm dead.
[163:58.82]He's obsessed with this.
[164:02.16]I just want goddamn safe driving.
[164:04.66]I just want safe drivers.
[164:16.26]It's even worse when you pull up behind those people and they've got those stickers on the back of their car that show how many children are in the family.
[164:27.70]Oh yeah, there's me, there's dad, and there's one, two, three, four children!
[164:32.20]Oh.
[164:32.99]Are they in the car now?
[164:38.51]What are you... Okay.
[164:50.48]How many children are in here?
[164:52.72]Okay, I gotta start shooting things.
[165:10.14]Oh, this is tricky.
[165:13.84]Alright, I need silver key.
[165:17.32]Remember that.
[165:17.82]These guys are hard to melee.
[165:34.53]Silver, silver.
[165:35.17]Remember silver.
[165:35.89]Silver.
[165:42.50]Anything I missed down here?
[165:43.44]No.
[165:47.38]What stock superpower is the best?
[165:53.17]Uh... Well, there's a loaded question.
[165:58.49]Because...
[166:00.16]Is this superpower that you have that you're the only person that has this superpower?
[166:05.04]And if you choose flying all of a sudden, you become like public enemy number one.
[166:09.56]There's a person flying.
[166:11.26]And we have to do something about that person?
[166:13.86]Or is it like we live in a superhero society?
[166:23.65]Just like we're in a superhero... ...world.
[166:33.05]Uh, the best stock power?
[166:37.21]No, it's not.
[166:37.75]It's not invisibility.
[166:38.65]It's not.
[166:40.73]Guys, if you're invisible, you can still die.
[166:45.90]Like, if you're invisible, you can still step on a landmine.
[166:49.60]So, no, you still die.
[166:51.24]I would say... I'm dead.
[166:55.38]Yeah, like Hypo just said, time control.
[166:59.57]And nothing too extreme, I just mean, like, being able to rewind... Maybe, like... Maybe, like, 10 minutes.
[167:10.68]Right?
[167:10.88]10 minutes.
[167:15.50]You can make the universe go back 10 minutes whenever you want.
[167:20.92]Nothing bad happens, it's just you have control over this device that makes it so the whole world rewinds 10 minutes.
[167:26.09]And nobody knows it.
[167:30.08]You know how many times I've, like, left my wallet somewhere, or, like, oh, fuck, my keys are in, oh, just rewind and just grab them.
[167:41.78]Or, like, if you ate something that you didn't want to eat, and you didn't like it, if you went to the menu, and you said, okay, here's, um, uh, I want the steak, please, and you order, you get the steak, and you eat it, and you don't like it, just rewind and order something else.
[167:52.55]You seriously wouldn't want that power?
[167:53.89]To go to a restaurant and be able to eat, and then rewind and pick something else?
[168:01.57]Okay, Adam Sandler.
[168:03.03]By the way, Adam Sandler is up for an Academy Award, probably.
[168:06.58]So all of you Adam Sandler haters out there, just know that that dude is going to potentially win the Best Actor of the Year Award.
[168:17.57]Go look it up.
[168:21.25]You think we're in the darkest timeline.
[168:22.95]A lot of you guys talk a lot of shit about Mr. Sandler.
[168:28.70]And now he's up for fucking one of the most coveted acting awards, potentially, that exists.
[168:35.78]Okay, I gotta kill these fucking things.
[168:45.87]I need ammo on a weapon.
[168:49.13]There's no weapon ammo line around here.
[168:51.04]These guys can just aim and shoot.
[168:54.44]He's not gonna win.
[168:56.32]You know what?
[168:57.90]I kind of hope he does.
[168:58.68]I kind of hope he does.
[169:01.95]In some weird way.
[169:03.31]I hope he does.
[169:09.63]I hope Adam Sandler wins Best Actor.
[169:17.13]You know those, like, events that people say is the event that happened that really crossed us over and that was the turning point?
[169:25.77]Adam Sandler winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards might be that event.
[169:29.33]And I can't fucking do this.
[169:38.70]Turn around.
[169:40.22]What?
[169:43.34]Turn around.
[169:51.49]That's the start of the world ending events.
[169:55.60]No, I've just got to go buy them.
[170:00.41]Is this open?
[170:00.87]Oh, God.
[170:03.21]Give me a break.
[170:10.71]Um... Shit.
[170:13.95]I'm sure Joel is behind you.
[170:21.98]Is he?
[170:23.24]Wait, what happened over here?
[170:24.18]Is this the turn around thing?
[170:26.04]Turn around, turn around.
[170:28.56]Oh.
[170:29.71]That's what I did.
[170:33.39]I get you now.
[170:33.93]Is he still here?
[170:40.04]Wait, is Joel... I talked a lot of shit about Joel.
[170:44.90]Is he still here?
[170:54.02]Yes.
[170:55.14]He's still in the bathroom.
[170:58.20]No, he definitely left the stream on and fell asleep.
[171:00.33]It's like 6 o'clock in the morning over there.
[171:02.23]Should I try to wake him up?
[171:10.26]Alright, I'm gonna wake him up.
[171:12.40]I'm gonna wake him up.
[171:26.20]No, I'm not gonna peek his mic.
[171:34.89]Okay.

[173:11.97]I'm curious.
[173:24.59]Um, overhealed.
[173:33.05]Would you guys be mad at me?
[173:35.87]Tell the truth, really.
[173:36.73]Would you guys be upset with me?
[173:40.25]If some random billionaire paid me... A million dollars to stream Fortnite ten times in a row.
[173:49.82]Would you guys be angry if I did that?
[173:55.98]Would you be able to step with me?
[174:06.78]Any billionaires here?
[174:20.81]Do you ever think, how many, okay, how many people here do you think are millionaires?
[174:24.19]Do you think?
[174:25.31]If there's like, let's say there's 36, 700 people here.
[174:28.80]Statistically speaking, how many people here have a million dollars in their bank account right now?
[174:33.16]What do you think?
[174:38.69]There's definitely a millionaire in this chat, and they're sitting there going like, they're talking about me.
[174:42.85]Alright, don't say anything.
[174:46.57]Don't say anything.
[174:59.45]Favorite weapon.
[175:05.94]Not me.
[175:10.66]It's only you.
[175:15.10]Haven't we already gone over this?
[175:16.24]I don't have a million dollars.
[175:21.06]And if I did, do you think I would tell you about it?
[175:26.48]I don't know.
[175:26.90]We already went over this.
[175:29.59]A million dollars just came in.
[175:33.11]One million.
[175:35.81]Jeremy, how about I pay you not to play Fortnite?
[175:37.75]That's from Vilemi.
[175:38.45]Thanks for the million dollars, Vilemi.
[175:44.30]Seriously, that's a lot of money.
[175:45.30]Thank you.
[175:51.56]Don't worry.
[175:52.34]Your money went to good use.
[175:53.26]I'm not going to be playing Fortnite.
[176:03.65]You did it.
[176:05.75]You're welcome.
[176:06.53]You're welcome.
[176:10.55]You live in Vegas?
[176:11.57]Yeah.
[176:13.09]I do.
[176:14.37]What is that?
[176:15.91]You know what I was going to do.
[176:17.04]I didn't do it, though, because I've done that like three or four times this stream already.
[176:31.04]Oh, that's a lot of acid.
[176:32.09]I died.
[176:32.53]I just comboed myself.
[176:37.80]Alright, what's better?
[176:39.00]Come on, what the fuck?
[176:40.88]Give me a break.
[176:47.05]Oh, this one sucks ass.
[176:49.11]Oh, this sucks ass.
[176:54.33]I'm gonna stay at range on this one.
[176:55.49]I'm gonna say... I'm just gonna launch grenades.
[177:04.32]From a safe distance, like here.
[177:11.25]What the fuck?
[177:12.03]Did you just throw a wad of gum at me?
[177:14.05]What the hell was that?
[177:21.80]There's a power-up over here.
[177:23.20]Oops, I already had one.

[178:20.39]Oh, there's fish in here!
[178:21.49]You can rocket jump?
[178:28.93]Yeah, but I can't.
[178:29.69]I'm terrible.
[178:31.67]It's not- I can't do it.
[178:35.31]I'm not sure if you were here like a half an hour ago, so maybe 45 minutes ago, but I was trying over and over to get it to work, and I couldn't get it to work, so I was getting so fucking just actually not even like joke angry.
[178:46.82]I was just getting like... I just like not... I wasn't feeling it, and I was gonna turn stream off and shit, so I just figured just don't even get that far, you know?
[179:07.66]I just feel myself getting actually just truly annoyed and it was just like... This is not fucking the way that I want to be.
[179:15.19]So I just gave up on it and I said I wasn't going to try it anymore.
[179:27.95]And I know that I lost a few people today with just how fucking... Seriously, just how annoying and angry I was.
[179:33.31]And I know.
[179:35.67]Two or three messages came in about like, dude...
[179:38.78]Like, that's just, just, you need to shut the fuck up and chill out, and I'm just, like, I told him to shut up and shit, and it just got ugly.
[179:48.66]Now, like, after, like, 40, like, an hour later or so, it's just, like, I shouldn't, I shouldn't do that.
[180:10.97]In the web of lies, no one knows what's actually real.
[180:14.31]No one knows what's actually real.
[180:16.68]They don't know which way we're going.
[180:20.40]All the while the water's flowing.
[180:24.96]Is it raining?
[180:28.50]Is it pouring?
[180:29.84]And it's certainly not showing.
[180:40.79]What if I just fucking started screaming that?
[180:42.79]You gotta get him with the tube.

[188:28.46]I don't know.
[188:30.26]Why do you kill anybody in any video game?
[188:31.88]It's because the computer decided that they were going to be in front of you and they were a monster to you or a bad guy.
[188:43.94]Oops.
[188:46.31]We're good?
[189:02.16]Let me show you this way.
[189:05.67]This way?
[189:06.15]This way looks pretty ominous.
[189:12.88]What's over here?
[189:13.64]I was just here, right?
[189:16.14]Yeah.
[189:21.79]I can't see shit.
[189:33.32]good who else hey wait hey hey hey hey somebody just said game sucks that's not fair why did you say that that's not true what's your reasoning
[190:04.18]What's your reasoning?
[190:04.72]The floor is yours.
[190:05.44]I think that was the death.
[190:18.21]That's it.
[190:18.57]They don't say anything else, they just come in and say that.
[190:30.83]What's this gonna do?
[190:34.94]What did that do?
[190:35.84]Oh, well, did that.
[190:44.85]We're up.
[190:50.41]Just running around and attacking things.
[190:57.72]They don't make them like they used to anymore.
[190:59.76]They don't make them like this anymore.
[191:02.91]They don't make them like this anymore where you're just, you're just a game and I need to stop fucking making little jokes and get back up there.
[191:31.29]These guys live here.
[191:32.41]Why are you doing this?
[191:37.67]I don't know.
[191:38.83]Because this is, like, an evil castle or something.
[191:41.31]With, like, demons and shit.
[191:43.62]Yeah, demons live in hell.
[191:49.60]What's the point there?
[191:54.71]Load your quicksave.
[191:55.65]Am I fucked right now?
[192:01.59]No, this the the where's the elevator come down goes down to where?
[192:06.77]Where's that elevator?
[192:28.38]Hold on I'll get another 30 seconds and I'm gonna load the quicksave
[192:32.95]30 more seconds.
[192:34.73]Hold on, I know it's like I can get there from here, I think.
[192:52.76]Nooo, stop wasting ammo, too.
[192:54.54]What are you, insane?
[192:57.80]Alright, I think I'm almost there.
[192:58.82]I'm gonna get there just in time.
[193:06.60]I don't know.
[193:21.15]I'm gonna go for it.
[193:25.41]Yeah.
[193:25.59]That was a bad idea.
[193:28.99]And now I'm way worse than I was off before.
[193:36.24]Anybody else left alive?
[193:40.68]So that's the way we gotta go.
[193:45.73]What's down here?
[193:46.67]Ooh, green candies.
[193:51.85]One more.
[194:01.16]Got them both.
[194:07.83]How could you not like it?
[194:11.80]It's got candy.
[194:23.20]I think the best part about this game is probably... I like how the weapons... The variety of weapons is pretty good.
[194:39.40]I think my favorite weapon is probably the thing I'm holding right now.
[194:57.53]But they're all good.
[194:59.55]Found it.
[195:05.21]Summoning is good.
[195:17.97]I think I went this way already Oh, there it is
[195:54.42]Holy fuck, I almost just died, dude.
[195:56.86]Imagine if I was standing over there.
[196:07.93]Neptune.
[196:09.72]Mars.
[196:11.56]Pluto.
[196:13.62]Mars.
[196:16.24]I don't know.
[196:25.33]Green!
[196:34.88]Nothing else up here?
[196:35.64]No secrets?
[196:44.32]Can we get an actual Neptune?
[196:45.72]We already have it.
[196:46.58]It's the worst emote on the channel.
[196:54.30]I know that's very debatable, but still, that's a pretty hot topic.
[197:02.53]If you truly think that Jermapop is the worst emote on the channel, I'm sorry, but we completely disagree.
[197:10.88]It's so much so that I...
[197:15.64]That's like you telling me that Almond Joy is your favorite candy.
[197:20.18]I'm gonna say this.
[197:22.12]What are you talking about?
[197:24.32]Like, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups exist.
[197:26.72]That's not possible.
[197:28.44]We just will never agree on anything.
[197:41.63]Boss time?
[197:45.75]This kind of... This looks and smells like a boss.
[197:47.57]What does that say?
[197:51.93]You are being watched.
[197:53.25]I know.
[197:55.73]But by how many people do you know?
[197:56.91]Yeah, this is a boss.
[197:59.45]Alright, here's the deal.
[198:01.19]I know... Hold on.
[198:03.32]This is going to be the last thing I do on the stream today.
[198:05.54]We'll see you tomorrow after this.
[198:08.90]for I don't know maybe maybe I'll convince someone to play halo maybe I don't know it's possible um there's also I'll be here before the stream starts tomorrow
[198:23.07]There's a couple of games that I've been waiting to play.
[198:26.02]We'll see if I can get somebody to maybe play it.
[198:28.20]If not, if maybe I'll just... It's such a sour note at this point that like, hey, like I... It's just... I think it might need to exist as that whole... It might just have to exist that way.
[198:39.21]Oh yeah, I also have a device that's interesting that I want to play with.
[198:45.13]We'll see.
[198:47.94]I'll just do the campaign solo.
[198:49.34]Yeah, I might just like... I don't know.
[198:50.98]We'll see.
[198:51.62]It'll be a game time decision.
[198:55.08]We'll figure it out tomorrow.
[198:57.14]But I'm still doing this.
[198:58.54]The corrupt spirit.
[199:01.48]Oh, it is an eye.
[199:03.76]A lot of health.
[199:10.97]Oh boy.
[199:11.65]Alright.
[199:11.89]I think I'm just going to dodge it.
[199:22.14]I didn't have enough.
[199:23.88]Okay, get out.
[199:35.31]Ow.
[199:35.95]Am I even hitting him?
[199:42.27]Ow.
[199:42.77]He's just throwing fucking cinder blocks at me.
[199:52.65]We can't really dodge him either.
[200:02.94]I think I just have to stand still and like just go back and forth like this That's the play What's phase two?
[200:26.70]Is there a phase two?
[200:29.48]Damn it.
[200:29.98]Damn it.
[200:30.78]Damn it.
[200:31.20]Damn it.
[200:31.54]Damn it.
[200:31.88]Damn it.
[200:32.18]Damn it.
[200:32.44]Damn it.
[200:32.66]Damn it.
[200:33.14]Oof.
[200:40.24]Oof.
[200:41.05]Oof!
[200:56.75]Did I actually get hit by that fucking thing?
[200:59.15]Oh, man.
[201:00.35]I'm out of ammo.
[201:02.19]Do I have any ammo for any weapon?
[201:05.09]I don't.
[201:05.41]This is really bad.
[201:10.20]Run away.
[201:15.96]I have to go up.
[201:18.00]Ow.
[201:18.60]Please.
[201:19.68]No.
[201:20.08]Fuck you.
[201:24.44]Stupid thing.
[201:28.07]getting those in here.
[201:28.73]I actually would rather be up here.
[201:31.89]This is a good spot for this.
[201:33.17]Alright, I'm staying up here.
[201:35.05]Just heal, and let's use these.
[201:42.73]Are they reaching?
[201:55.86]Here they come!
[202:04.72]Give me some health.
[202:07.32]Is he burning me?
[202:13.03]He's putting fire down.
[202:25.96]Oh shit, that hurt.
[202:29.20]Oh fuck, there's fire everywhere now.
[202:30.44]Alright, don't fuck this up, this took a long time.
[202:47.34]Oh, fuck!
[202:53.27]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[202:56.75]Oh, no, no!
[202:59.31]Did it.
[203:07.59]Just don't die.
[203:13.75]Star of Torment.
[203:15.76]I didn't even know this existed.
[203:17.26]I probably would have... I should have picked this up.
[203:20.50]Would have helped.
[203:24.44]You can die.
[203:24.82]This doesn't matter.
[203:25.74]The level's over.
[203:27.23]Alright, get out.
[203:28.15]What about a secret, though?
[203:29.95]I may have missed a secret.
[203:32.19]Not like it matters.
[203:43.46]Have I gotten one secret on any of the boss fights?
[203:46.34]I don't think I have.
[203:46.94]Oh well.
[203:59.53]That's for another playthrough.
[204:00.57]And let's go.
[204:11.44]No secret.
[204:13.89]Killer.
[204:15.27]And Scholar.
[204:16.71]See, you guys tell me not to read this stuff, but you get achievements for it.
[204:27.21]There are two more areas to do.
[204:30.30]I'm not going to lie.
[204:32.10]I kind of like it medieval.
[204:35.86]Yeah, we can just keep playing that and slowly finish it.
[204:41.06]I like this.
[204:50.37]The next time I play this, it'll probably be over.
[204:52.93]It's a pretty fun, just chill gameplay.
[204:54.30]What are your first impressions?
[205:00.24]It's pretty- it's good?
[205:04.50]Arcane expanse is the best area?
[205:06.23]Oh, cool.
[205:08.93]Is it time for cleanup detail?
[205:10.33]No.
[205:11.41]No, we'll just- we're gonna start fresh tomorrow.
[205:14.88]If you missed the first part of this stream, it was an absolute shitshow.
[205:19.04]But in somehow the best possible way, I think.
[205:22.08]It was a fucking disaster.
[205:28.67]But, uh, we'll see you tomorrow.
[205:32.35]Thanks, uh, again for, uh, BoxBox for the raid.
[205:35.57]If any of you guys are still here... Thanks for coming.
[205:42.16]Thanks for sticking around.
[205:50.30]We'll see you tomorrow.
[205:53.31]What happened?
[205:53.81]I just got here.
[205:58.75]It's impossible for me to explain the first two hours of the stream.
[206:03.57]It's kind of just... It was just... It was a wonderful disaster.
[206:08.44]We'll put it that way.
[206:10.00]Thank you for the halo diarrhea.
[206:11.40]You're very welcome.
[206:16.38]Alright, let's call it a night.
[206:18.87]Start fresh tomorrow.
[206:25.78]Thanks for watching.
[206:39.51]Good stuff.
[206:41.61]Hey, let's just check it and see.
[206:42.77]Hey, who's the top subgifter?
[206:44.07]Richard Nixon.
[206:45.15]Yep.
[206:46.65]Top bits.
[206:47.94]Phylactery Lich.
[206:49.14]And top bits 2.
[206:51.54]I can't even read it.
[206:52.12]It's too small.
[206:55.32]Richard Nixon, thank you, Richard Nixon, for always giving 50 subs to stream, somehow.
[207:01.31]I... I don't know.
[207:05.45]Alright, let's head back to the bits.
[207:08.52]For those of you that don't know, if you are a new viewer, I do not read subs or bits or donation or bit messages during the stream.
[207:18.44]We do it at the end.
[207:20.34]We just hang out for like 30 to 45 plus minutes and just chill and talk.
[207:24.99]That's how it works.
[207:25.53]Let's go back.
[207:32.96]Thank you to Sad Vega for the 300 bits.
[207:36.92]Howdy, Jerma.
[207:37.40]Just doing that reminder that we'd love to go through some emote options with a vote sometime.
[207:41.56]Still really looking to hold out for that weird emote of where they photoshopped the eye so you looked so... Oh, yeah.
[207:51.19]Yep.
[207:53.61]The one that I thought was a real picture during the thing.
[208:02.00]Yep.
[208:04.39]It's a great picture.
[208:05.51]It is.
[208:06.83]It has to be an emote.
[208:07.75]It will.
[208:18.89]Thank you, though.
[208:24.63]Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.
[208:25.95]Hey.
[208:26.87]Hey.
[208:27.65]How are you?
[208:29.36]That's it?
[208:29.90]Hey.
[208:31.84]Sad Vega, again for 300 bits.
[208:33.12]Thanks, Sad Vega.
[208:35.04]I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[208:36.10]House cleaning stream when?
[208:38.10]Just go pro it and clean your house.
[208:40.98]You seem to love viscer cleanup details so much.
[208:43.37]You could easily make a joke video of you just cleaning a place with a mop and a bucket and chat would eat it up.
[208:48.19]Honestly, it doesn't even have to be your house.
[208:49.49]You can make like a joke studio set for where you screw up.
[208:54.77]I think we've actually talked about that stream before.
[208:57.33]Of just cleaning a house on stream.
[209:04.35]what that's but it every time I think about how funny something like that could be like yes imagine a scenario where I rent out a studio and just make it just a dirty office or just like a dirty living room and make it all dirty so then I just clean the room that stream would take
[209:31.12]Hours to make it dirty and then hours to immediately clean it up.
[209:38.13]It would be so fucked up.
[209:45.87]But it would be fun.
[209:51.08]Maybe, for a little while...
[210:03.80]Viscera Detail LARP, yeah.
[210:08.53]No, there's a lot of things that are in front of that that need to get done first before something like that would even be thought about.
[210:16.33]Two or three fake rooms.
[210:19.01]Yeah, have like a fake house.
[210:20.51]But then I would rather just do The Sims thing.
[210:22.14]I already told you about that, how I want to do that.
[210:26.98]Just make, in a studio, a big fake house, and you guys control me, and I'm just, it's sim.
[210:33.88]I have to, like, pee and shit.
[210:42.47]I have to be, like, social, I have to go do things, I have to, like, call people on the phone and stuff.
[210:54.12]We talk about a lot of weird shit here, but some of them actually turn into streams.
[210:57.61]Hey, Flugboy, thanks for the 250.
[211:04.73]I honestly saw this from a fucking Malenia away when you said Joel was playing with you.
[211:10.21]I knew this was going to happen.
[211:12.31]I knew Joel would have the attention span of a goldfish.
[211:15.95]But I love you both for this.
[211:17.07]Thank you for the stream.
[211:18.05]Reach is probably, like, one of my top 10 games of all time.
[211:24.34]That's so funny, I love it.
[211:30.88]He foresaw it.
[211:34.62]They both have the same attention span.
[211:45.41]Yeah, you just gave two children the keys.
[211:54.49]But thank you, Flugboy.
[211:56.59]I still had a lot of fun.
[212:00.73]Hey, Grapple Mace, thanks for the 250.
[212:02.38]Jeremy, please play Picross again sometime.
[212:07.02]Well, depending on how the stream goes tomorrow.
[212:12.16]You know, this might be an entire non-canon week.
[212:16.27]Depending on what happens tomorrow.
[212:22.45]We'll see.
[212:28.00]Filler content week.
[212:33.58]We'll see.
[212:40.40]The extended universe.
[212:44.67]I love Picross.
[212:45.77]It's one of my favorite lie down with your Nintendo DS and do.
[212:49.17]It's like the reason why I even owned a DS was to play Picross with the little stylus on the little screen.
[212:57.00]I didn't even play a Zelda game on that thing.
[212:58.66]I didn't buy Pok√©mon.
[213:03.26]I did not own Pok√©mon.
[213:04.96]I did not own... I just... Nope.
[213:08.60]I bought it for Picross.
[213:19.05]And there was another game, too.
[213:21.63]What did I play on the DS sometimes?
[213:27.53]Play Pok√©mon tomorrow or Riot.
[213:29.33]Lose 95% of your viewer base.
[213:35.85]If you're still here after the last two streams, I don't think I would lose 95% of you.
[213:43.42]Let's be honest.
[213:55.30]Let's go.
[213:55.82]That's it.
[213:56.28]Let's get out of here.
[214:02.28]Actually, I'm of the opinion that I thought I thought the last two streams in a row were like fun like really fun even though they would like a diarrhea I Thought I just I still had fun.
[214:14.28]That's the thing But Thank you post for the 500 bits
[214:26.89]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching you since the early TF2 days, and you never fail to make me laugh.
[214:30.85]You're a huge inspiration to me as another guy with ADHD.
[214:34.79]And while I do respect it, seeing you make the decision to move to hospice care after your hernia really hit me hard.
[214:40.64]Here's to you.
[214:41.92]Jeremy will never forget you.
[214:47.18]Thanks a lot.
[214:47.64]Appreciate it.
[214:48.26]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[214:52.20]Hey, good night, man.
[214:52.80]Thanks for waking me up by my name a little while ago.
[214:57.70]That actually worked?
[215:06.43]Thank you, Post, though, for the 500 bits.
[215:09.95]Did I miss a $100 bit donation?
[215:12.03]I missed 10,000 bits a long time ago.
[215:14.88]How?
[215:16.62]Is this when me and Joel were arguing about who was bullying the other one to play Halo?
[215:21.80]Which, by the way, like five days ago,
[215:26.42]I was like, hey, you wanted to play, let's play Halo.
[215:29.22]Okay, sounds fun.
[215:33.94]And then he just fucking, I could, he did the thing on Discord when it was like, you see, Joel is typing.
[215:42.10]Not anymore?
[215:43.39]Joel is typing.
[215:44.35]Not anymore?
[215:45.67]Okay.
[215:47.07]Joel is currently typing and not anymore.
[215:48.49]Okay.
[215:49.83]Okay.
[215:51.82]And I got this huge, like, holy shit, man, I really want to be really here.
[215:55.01]Like, hey, I fucking don't even like that franchise.
[215:58.79]I'm going to be pretending.
[216:01.79]I know it's your favorite franchise of all time.
[216:05.27]But I can probably only pretend for like two hours tops.
[216:09.18]And I was like, it's all good, man, whatever.
[216:10.76]I'm sure you'll have fun.
[216:14.42]And then I was like, I'm pretending too.
[216:15.98]Like, I've played all these games already.
[216:19.36]I've beaten Halo Reject 15 times, like 10 times at least.
[216:21.90]It's like one of my favorite games.
[216:22.78]And I'm like, we'll just both pretend, doesn't matter.
[216:24.92]And he's like, alright, cool.
[216:37.69]I hate Halo too.
[216:42.71]That's my first experience with Halo.
[216:47.09]besides being in a college dorm room with an Xbox chunky controller in my hand for five minutes.
[216:57.93]I wouldn't have it any other way.
[216:59.97]He thought you were a Halo streamer.
[217:07.07]The whole thing is funny, so it doesn't- it's fucking hilarious.
[217:16.63]But Jareden gave 10,000 bits earlier.
[217:21.60]Thank you so much.
[217:22.42]I'm sorry I missed it.
[217:26.02]There's a huge amount of money to miss, and I'm really sorry that I did.
[217:29.42]I think that was in the middle of the crisis we were having.
[217:31.52]They said, this has been the absolute best podcast I've ever listened to.
[217:36.40]Thank you so much for this amazing time.
[217:39.22]We covered a few topics, yeah.
[217:43.77]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[217:46.80]Hey Jerma, what's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and ruining the... Wait, what?
[217:53.02]What's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and running the hair dryer on yourself all at the same time when nobody is home?
[218:01.63]What?
[218:08.05]Like, blow drying your hair while you're on the toilet?
[218:17.70]What's my opinion on that?
[218:20.64]Um... You only have two hands.
[218:29.67]So if you're on the toilet and you have an iPhone in one hand and a blow dryer in the other, how are you... My opinion on it is you don't have a third hand.
[218:40.65]Do you put the phone on the ground?
[218:42.62]You don't have a pocket?
[218:44.22]Put the blow dryer down on the floor?
[218:51.49]My opinion is I don't like it.
[218:53.97]That's it.
[218:57.17]GTX 1080 Quad SLI.
[218:59.27]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[219:03.52]Hello, Jeremy.
[219:04.04]What's your recommended method of consuming a Reese's Cup?
[219:07.30]And why is it your favorite candy?
[219:09.08]Anyways, can't wait to squad up with you in Fortnite 2 tomorrow while eating the $25 meal deal from Burger King.
[219:15.71]Cheers.
[219:16.99]From... That's not who sent the message.
[219:22.56]Well, the Hawaii Reese's all in one go.
[219:28.17]Open it up.
[219:29.41]Take the whole Reese's paper off.
[219:32.31]And put the whole thing in my mouth.
[219:34.35]And slowly enjoy the whole cup.
[219:39.83]And oh, there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[219:43.42]Yes, there is.
[219:45.89]You're like, oh, I put my tongue through it and push out the peanut butter and then I put my hand, I put it up my nose and swallow it through my nasal cavity.
[219:54.04]That's wrong.
[219:55.36]Don't do that.
[219:57.36]People don't even eat Reese's like that.
[220:01.18]There was a whole ad campaign.
[220:02.20]It was like, well, how do you do it?
[220:03.60]Well, I peel off the edges and then I dunk it in milk and then I squish it between my teeth.
[220:07.92]No, you just eat it.
[220:09.48]It's a candy.
[220:10.20]It's a fucking chocolate bar.
[220:15.96]Yeah, it's not an Oreo.
[220:17.40]It's a Reese's.
[220:23.79]And by the way, there's only two ways to eat an Oreo.
[220:26.43]You either eat it, just bite into it, or you like do the turn and then you like, well, what I do is I turn it and I lick off the cream and then I, that's what I do.
[220:38.00]Okay, that's the second and out of two ways to eat an Oreo.
[220:46.15]Okay.
[220:57.60]Let me show you how a real man eats a chocolate sandwich cookie.
[221:04.04]Alright, here's how you do it.
[221:06.44]You grab the Oreo with your forceps.
[221:11.16]And you know what that means?
[221:11.97]That's thumb and middle finger.
[221:13.47]Don't use your index finger.
[221:14.63]What are you, out of your mind?
[221:16.37]Thumb and middle finger.
[221:21.65]Grab the edge of the cookie.
[221:23.07]Lift up.
[221:24.63]Your fingers should be no more than halfway down the cookie.
[221:27.54]Okay?
[221:30.47]You then dunk that cookie not to the point where your fingers are touching the milk.
[221:36.87]A little bit less than halfway.
[221:38.49]Just let it sit there for about 1, Mississippi 2, Mississippi 3, 4.
[221:44.97]Lift it out.
[221:46.91]Tap, tap, tap on the edge to the excess milk.
[221:50.00]Bite into that.
[221:51.79]That's how you do it.
[221:52.73]Then you grab that little half moon that you have there.
[221:55.63]Hold it the other way so you're holding it long ways now.
[221:58.87]And keep doing it in half and then you eat the whole thing.
[222:06.34]You do it for four seconds.
[222:07.44]No, just like bang, bang, bang, done.
[222:11.38]Lift it out.
[222:13.90]On the edge.
[222:17.66]There you go.
[222:19.28]I will say that I don't know how people eat Oreos just dry out of the can.
[222:27.99]Eating Oreos is like eating saltines.
[222:31.73]It's like... I feel like I could cough and dust will come out of my mouth.
[222:45.35]Saltines are good.
[222:46.37]Yeah, I know.
[222:48.23]But it's like eating a saltine.
[222:50.33]If you eat a raw Oreo cookie, it's just like it turns into this weird sandy, dusty mush.
[223:00.42]I love these hot take sections of the stream.
[223:08.70]What do you think a cookie is?
[223:13.79]okay let's go another layer we'll go one more step here uh should a cookie be soft or soft and chewy or crunchy and brittle this is going to determine how many of you get removed from the channel wow most of you get to stay
[223:45.88]Soft and chewy cookies... Are just... The best.
[223:57.33]Crunchy cookies... No... No... I wouldn't... I don't hate... Hard and crunchy cookies.
[224:10.36]But there is a line... Where if you bite into... If I bite into a cookie...
[224:16.41]and it turns into five cookies that's unacceptable and that's what happens a lot of times soft chewy you can just bite into it it's it's moldable
[224:39.86]They're durable.
[224:41.90]If you drop a soft cookie on the ground, it's not gonna shatter.
[224:45.76]If you drop a hard cookie on the ground, it shatters, and then you can't eat it anymore.
[224:54.52]Shatterproof.
[225:01.39]This idiot eats cookie dough.
[225:05.23]Uh...
[225:08.89]Is that some kind of strange unpopular opinion?
[225:12.23]To like cookie dough?
[225:16.59]Cookie dough, it's everywhere.
[225:18.97]It's in every ice cream shop.
[225:21.28]It's the most popular ice cream flavor.
[225:23.94]It's the most... Every cookie dough is synonymous with a lovely thing that everybody likes.
[225:29.98]That's like saying you don't like bacon.
[225:31.38]What are you, not epic?
[225:45.90]Hey, a pink iru.
[225:47.28]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[225:53.80]Thank you.
[225:55.66]They say, thank you for providing a ton of laughs and giving us an escape from reality.
[225:59.22]Life can get us down sometimes, but a laugh in a tough moment can make all the difference.
[226:03.47]Going through a rough bit, bit of a rough patch, and your streams are always the highlight of my week.
[226:08.97]Watching you and Joel interact made me laugh the hardest I have in months.
[226:12.07]Can't wait for the next one.
[226:14.51]Neither can I.
[226:16.33]Should be a lot of fun.
[226:20.21]Thank you so much for the thousand bits.
[226:21.67]Thanks for hanging out.
[226:26.53]I am absolutely honored to be the highlight of your week.
[226:35.85]Thank you.
[226:39.25]Thank you for the one thousand bits.
[226:45.31]Let's get the credits rolling.
[226:49.50]That means we change scenes.
[226:51.66]I know how to stream.
[226:58.02]Thanks for watching, guys.
[226:59.32]We'll see you tomorrow.
[227:04.35]Thank you for all the subs, all the support, as always.
[227:08.75]Much love to all of you.
[227:09.43]Thank you.
[227:12.35]Whether you sub today, or whether you've been subbed for six years.
[227:18.83]Thank you.
[227:26.50]You haven't finished the bits?
[227:27.80]I will, don't worry.
[227:29.02]Don't worry.
[227:33.14]I've been subbed for a year, and I just realized.
[227:35.20]I need new sub...
[227:38.76]I need new sub badges.
[227:40.70]It's just coming up on that point where I never thought that was even going to be a thing.
[227:46.02]Looking down that way.
[227:47.26]Oh, three, two, three year sub badges.
[227:51.12]I was like, I don't think that'll ever happen.
[227:52.66]I don't know.
[227:53.50]I don't think people will sub for three straight years, but I guess it'll be here.
[227:57.42]And now that's a reality a lot.
[228:01.40]And you could do four, five, six years in a row.
[228:07.72]Holy shit.
[228:13.30]Who would sub for that long?
[228:14.80]Ew.
[228:18.63]One of our founders.
[228:20.47]GrumpClump.
[228:23.01]49-month subscriber.
[228:25.03]Wow.
[228:26.63]That's a long time.
[228:32.93]But, thank you again, seriously.
[228:36.66]Let's continue with the bits.
[228:37.46]We still have a little bit to do.
[228:40.49]Thanks for the 250.
[228:41.39]Thank you, The Thrill, for the 1500 bits.
[228:42.61]$15 from The Thrill.
[229:05.98]I expected this was going to be a flawless, stunning playthrough of Halo Reach.
[229:09.38]Instead, I watched over an hour or so of what was a hilarious, chaotic, and truly beautiful disaster.
[229:14.42]One hell of a 26th birthday gift.
[229:17.73]Much love, friendo.
[229:19.27]Thank you.
[229:23.21]Thank you so much.
[229:25.62]Somebody mentioned something.
[229:28.96]They said that one of the levels we were on had like a par of 15 minutes and we had just been doing nothing for I think 30 or 40 straight minutes.
[229:39.33]But!
[229:40.83]Happy 26th birthday.
[229:44.28]Hope you had a good one.
[229:48.62]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[229:50.86]Happy 26th birthday.
[229:52.94]He's gonna forget the birthday again.
[229:54.22]It's not time.
[229:56.08]It's not time.
[230:00.64]I still have a full day and a half.
[230:01.96]What do you mean?
[230:02.46]It's not time for that.
[230:03.88]I remember.
[230:06.78]Eugene, thanks for the $2.50.
[230:07.62]When are you going to apologize to Fortnite Jimmy?
[230:11.30]I already did.
[230:16.89]Surgilbutt, thanks for the $2.50, Surgilbutt.
[230:19.05]Serious question, do you eat Starburst with or without the paper on it?
[230:26.40]you just unlocked in my head something that I haven't even you've unlocked something and I don't know what it was you unlocked I did do this but well I don't think it was with starburst what was it with I had this very very distinct memory of chewing on paper and moving it around and moving it
[230:56.16]What was that?
[230:59.85]No, not Tootsie Rolls, not Tootsie Rolls.
[231:03.69]What was it?
[231:04.23]It was paper, and I remember... No, not Cupcake Wrapper.
[231:13.94]Shit.
[231:16.24]The candy dots?! !
[231:19.57]I think you got it.
[231:21.13]Yeah, I used to tear off a piece and I would just put the whole thing in my mouth and chew on it and just pick it off and spread it around.
[231:30.74]Yep.
[231:31.56]Yeah, that's what it was.
[231:32.30]I would just tear off a piece and I would just stick it in there and just slowly mush it around in my mouth and gums and stuff until it popped off and then I would move the paper to the side.
[231:46.06]Anyways, um, no, I did not do that with Starburst.
[231:48.68]I did that with the candy dots.
[231:52.70]Yeah, yeah, the candy buttons that were on the sheet of paper.
[232:00.53]Those things were awesome, too.
[232:01.71]Do they even still make those?
[232:04.12]Probably buy them on Amazon or something.
[232:07.86]Also, praise that son, bro.
[232:10.54]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[232:12.56]Jerma, I passed my CDL test today.
[232:15.44]Thanks for being such an awesome streamer.
[232:16.80]Watching your stuff always manages to put me in a great mood.
[232:19.24]Cheer 100.
[232:20.28]Passed your CDL.
[232:24.44]Well, would you look at that?
[232:28.36]Passed my CDL.
[232:31.08]What is that?
[232:31.47]CDL?
[232:40.15]Is it like SATs?
[232:45.69]Is it a driving test?
[232:50.43]Driving, your CDL driver's test.
[232:53.85]It's for a driver's license.
[232:55.03]Oh, well, fucking hell yeah.
[233:00.05]You could use that $5,000 and get yourself a Honda Civic.
[233:03.41]You were here earlier, right?
[233:05.52]You had to have been here.
[233:11.69]It allows for trucking and taxi driving.
[233:13.77]Oh, shit.
[233:15.99]Well, nice job.
[233:20.79]Get the Tesla truck.
[233:22.03]I have not, you know, you want to talk about hot takes?
[233:25.28]I have not even given you my take on the Tesla truck.
[233:29.76]But it's at this point I've already, I've said, I just imagine the words that I would have said.
[233:34.88]You already know.
[233:35.30]People have already made the jokes a thousand times.
[233:39.27]I can't, it's been too long.
[233:41.38]I could say, oh yeah, Nintendo 64 car.
[233:43.86]You've seen that on Twitter probably a thousand times.
[233:48.22]I could say, it looks like it's made out of aluminum foil.
[233:51.38]You've probably heard that already.
[234:03.09]So, there you go.
[234:05.09]Just, that's what I, that's my take.
[234:11.29]Please, only original jokes.
[234:12.65]And the windows.
[234:13.43]Yeah, the windows.
[234:15.76]You can't break them.
[234:16.98]I broke it.
[234:19.82]Right?
[234:20.12]Yeah.
[234:20.76]We all know this already.
[234:24.22]They don't have any... Wait, hold on.
[234:25.54]For a second, I was about to get really, really, really crazily upset about what you just said.
[234:29.08]I thought you said they don't have any cup holders.
[234:31.14]It's like, how do you make a... But what do you mean no cup holders in the whole car?
[234:43.49]Imagine not having a cup holder?
[234:53.14]You drink from a hose.
[234:57.04]There are no mirrors?
[234:58.42]No, there has to be mirrors, otherwise it gets illegal.
[235:06.49]No mirrors?
[235:07.37]What's a crumple zone?
[235:11.63]What is a crumple zone?
[235:21.29]Crumple Zone.
[235:22.71]That sounds like a section of, like, a Disney park.
[235:27.68]Like, Crumple Zone!
[235:29.00]It's like a gnome or something.
[235:31.06]Crumple Zone.
[235:37.59]So it's like a crash zone?
[235:42.75]It's for crashes so you don't fucking die!
[235:53.92]well okay welcome to the crumple zone yeah guys the if you're gonna test the truck you you know it's gonna just sit in your driveway so people look out the window and go oh you know what you're gonna be you're not gonna be worried about crumple zones
[236:21.89]That looks dumb.
[236:24.69]Ow.
[236:29.08]I'm worried about crumple zones.
[236:30.90]Term of Pluto.
[236:40.10]I think it looks cool.
[236:40.93]You know what?
[236:43.47]Let me see.
[236:44.01]Tesla truck.
[236:48.13]Okay, I wish I could see... I feel like we only have one angle of this thing.
[236:52.68]Do they have any video of it driving?
[236:54.30]I feel like I've only seen an image of this thing from the side.
[236:58.95]What does this thing actually even look like?
[237:07.11]Oh shit, this thing is actually kind of cool.
[237:17.24]That's what it looks like?
[237:20.00]No, that's a different company.
[237:21.74]That's a different company.
[237:23.76]Okay, never mind.
[237:26.24]That one looks cool.
[237:27.30]That's a cool looking one.
[237:32.02]This thing called the... The Neuron?
[237:36.54]The Neuron EV.
[237:38.64]That thing is fucking sick.
[237:41.60]Look at this thing.
[237:51.53]Here, I'll show you.
[237:52.29]Let me put it on.
[238:00.54]This thing's called the Neuron.
[238:14.20]That's pretty cool looking.
[238:16.14]Look at that thing.
[238:21.47]That's ugly.
[238:22.37]No, not the one on the right.
[238:23.41]I'm talking about the one on the left.
[238:26.95]You're a fucking neuron.
[238:29.43]What?
[238:32.65]You don't think that... That's like... That looks better.
[238:40.04]That one doesn't have any doors.
[238:42.28]What?
[238:42.50]How do you get in?
[238:46.46]You drive it.
[238:47.38]It's remote controlled.
[238:51.10]You sit on top of it.
[238:52.86]It doesn't have any doors.
[238:55.00]You sit in the back.
[238:57.56]In the back of the pickup load part.
[238:59.21]You sit back there with a wheel.
[239:05.71]I think that's cool.
[239:07.21]I think it's alright.
[239:09.27]Look, it actually has a back.
[239:11.90]No, there are no crumple zones.
[239:20.87]Looks like Mario Kart Wii Wheel.
[239:22.67]I mean, okay, it does look like an upgraded thing you can get in Mario Kart.
[239:30.65]That's the cool card that you get in Mario Kart, yes.
[239:38.33]I will agree.
[239:38.81]The one on the right is a little weird.
[239:39.77]Is that even a... Okay, so take a look.
[239:40.57]The one on the right...
[239:49.41]Is that the car?
[239:50.79]Or is... It's just a giant shark fin?
[239:54.53]Why would you... That... Why would you drive that?
[240:00.49]That's... That's really stupid.
[240:03.23]It's just huge.
[240:04.27]You're gonna go through like a drive-through.
[240:06.90]And you're gonna hit the top of the sign that says like, Please God, don't fucking drive a car here.
[240:11.94]If you're larger than... You know what I'm talking about?
[240:13.74]That sign?
[240:16.46]I would go onto tunnels and scream going through the tunnels.
[240:23.70]It's a semi.
[240:24.54]Oh, so it goes ba- okay.
[240:29.96]I thought it was just like a flounder.
[240:33.44]I think that one looks alright.
[240:39.35]Electric truck.
[240:41.33]Was that the only two of them?
[240:46.93]What about this one?
[240:48.41]The Rivian R1.
[240:50.32]Rivian R1T.
[240:53.57]Let's see.
[240:53.99]What's fine when you guys like?
[241:01.14]This one's... Alright.
[241:03.00]Okay.
[241:03.28]Hold on.
[241:03.66]Hold on a second.
[241:08.86]Hold on.
[241:09.16]What do you think about this one?
[241:15.78]This one in particular is you had to create a character and you went to the part where it said nose and you dragged the nose just forward.
[241:31.75]What do you think about this one?
[241:35.43]Is that a crumple zone?
[241:36.15]I think that might be a crumple zone.
[241:41.10]Is it?
[241:41.60]I see mirrors and I see a crumple zone.
[241:48.85]Is this truck even electric?
[241:55.13]It's got a big nose.
[241:56.55]Whatever.
[241:56.87]I mean, the back of the truck doesn't look very big.
[242:06.78]I think you can only fit a refrigerator in there, and you have to stand it straight up.
[242:14.45]This is the car that Bugleberry would drive.
[242:19.41]Why do I know what you mean?
[242:28.95]I like that one.
[242:34.55]Buy a fridge and then go through the drive-thru to hit the sign?
[242:40.73]Is that your goal is to fucking wreck the sign?
[242:48.64]Anyways.
[242:52.85]um I don't even okay so we were alright right praise that sun congratulations on passing your cdl thanks for the 500 bits thank you put that put that license to good use and then finally we had uh psychelos for the 500 bits
[243:18.26]Jerma and the Baby is my favorite video of yours, and I was wondering when we can expect the sequel.
[243:22.90]I've been waiting for six years.
[243:26.44]I'm not having any kids.
[243:30.65]I'm not having any kids.
[243:37.19]No children for me.
[243:44.84]No, baby Elbertson.
[243:45.94]No, not in the plans.
[243:47.30]Not in the plans.
[243:51.80]I'd rather be the fun uncle that everybody likes.
[243:57.45]That works for me.
[244:02.37]Otto is all we need.
[244:08.68]Oh no, you're not gonna pass on the funny genes.
[244:10.96]Pepe hands.
[244:15.36]Nah, I'll freeze it.
[244:16.64]I'll freeze some.
[244:18.56]What?
[244:19.04]Okay, let's keep going.
[244:20.42]That was weird.
[244:21.99]A bro-bot.
[244:23.55]Please stop.
[244:31.03]I'm just gonna freeze myself.
[244:47.53]what you were saying I'm gonna freeze myself and in a thousand years when they're going through we're gonna go find like the funny people where were they here they are well we still have there it's still available jermaOn eight five is still available we can we can keep that line going
[245:17.99]Your humor would be too outdated.
[245:19.47]That was a good attempt, but the ship is sinking.
[245:31.33]Oh, you better pick up a pail and start dumping water!
[245:39.54]Uh, but, uh, Brobot, formerly Softboy, thanks for the $2.51.
[245:44.52]Hey, Jerma, Reach was hilarious.
[245:46.00]A hot mess.
[245:47.42]I'm looking forward to what you and Joel do together next.
[245:50.62]When it comes to Halo, I'm kind of glad this stream turned out this way.
[245:53.98]Reach is amazing, but it has heavy themes towards the end.
[245:57.13]The first Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved, is pretty easy to set up for PC.
[246:00.35]Would really recommend playing that one first.
[246:02.67]Reach wouldn't be a bad way to follow it up.
[246:05.29]While you're waiting for 2 and 3, the main trilogy is comparable to Star Wars.
[246:10.97]Do hand sim co-op with Joel.
[246:14.56]Okay.
[246:17.44]And by the way, we can get tired of that in two hours.
[246:19.50]It don't matter.
[246:26.78]We got a Halo expert.
[246:28.26]Yeah.
[246:29.98]No, that's good to know.
[246:31.46]That is good to know.
[246:34.17]And you know what else you're about to know?
[246:41.95]That we've reached the end.
[246:47.36]Thanks again for watching.
[246:48.62]Thanks for participating.
[246:50.06]Thanks for hanging out in this messy non-canon stream.
[246:57.53]They're all canon.
[246:58.57]Can't escape it, right?
[247:00.59]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[247:01.87]The plan tomorrow is wherever the wind decides to take us.
[247:07.05]There are a few things we can do.
[247:08.45]Depending on who or what is doing things tomorrow, I might try to do... Maybe we'll try Halo again.
[247:15.03]That's kind of funny to me that I just pretend like I didn't try yesterday.
[247:18.97]There's also... Well, let me just rifle off the things that are on my mind here.
[247:28.31]There's also... Alright, are you ready for this?
[247:36.72]There is... Dead Rising 3.
[247:41.77]I still have to play the rest of the FEAR stuff.
[247:45.85]FEAR 2.
[247:47.53]The DLC for FEAR.
[247:48.61]FEAR 2 has a thing.
[247:56.01]We'll see.
[248:01.62]No, please.
[248:02.14]No, please not Dead Rising 3.
[248:07.03]I did say that I had to beat it, though.
[248:08.81]I had to do it.
[248:10.85]Play the new Nancy Drew game.
[248:20.53]I promised.
[248:21.30]When did I promise I was going to play Nancy Drew?
[248:26.62]What are you talking about?
[248:36.64]Not Nancy Drew.
[248:37.46]Dead Rising 3.
[248:38.24]Yeah, I know.
[248:39.46]That's what I'm saying.
[248:44.18]No Dead Rising 3.
[248:45.70]Fuck that.
[248:48.38]Damn.
[248:48.78]Alright, just because one guy said that, I'm gonna look up Nancy Drew games that have come out on Steam.
[249:01.97]This is non-canon week.
[249:03.65]So, get out your non-canon streams now.

[249:37.75]Take care, guys.

[249:47.21]Raid.
[249:47.61]Raid.
[249:47.97]Raid.
[249:48.30]Raid.
[249:49.44]Yeah, we haven't raided anybody in a while.
[249:52.26]It's been like at least a month.
[249:54.24]Okay, fine.
[249:55.66]That's cool.
[249:56.46]That works for me.
[249:57.00]What's Vinny doing?
[249:59.88]What's Vinny up to?
[250:00.48]Let's take a look.
[250:07.27]Super Mario Maker.
[250:08.49]Ooh!
[250:15.75]Alright, here we go.
[250:22.73]See you guys tomorrow.
[250:29.02]Let's queue up the raid.
[250:36.16]I'm sorry for being a meanie.
[250:37.38]What are you talking about?
[250:41.12]Alright, goodbye.
[250:42.58]Take care.
