[ve:61.7.100]

[00:07.14]What about Rumbleverse?
[00:08.18]I've heard of it, but I haven't played it.
[00:09.36]Alright, what's it called?
[00:15.72]20 minutes?
[00:16.04]Is it on Steam?
[00:18.82]20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[00:22.87]Okay.
[00:23.99]Early access.
[00:25.35]This is also $3.
[00:26.05]Vampire Survivors is $3 too, isn't it?
[00:28.21]Or $2?
[00:28.31]That's interesting.
[00:28.79]Okay.
[00:38.77]Okay.
[00:40.71]Stream might have an issue here because I'm about to... Give me a sec.
[00:45.43]I'm downloading a game right now, so the stream might, like, die.
[00:54.79]Are we good?
[00:58.03]Rumble vs. Fun.
[00:58.93]This game's 100 megabytes.
[01:03.85]Damn.
[01:04.09]Okay.
[01:10.37]Let's see how it is.
[01:10.91]Mine is still done.
[01:21.25]Stop it!
[01:26.84]Stop!
[01:28.08]Yeah, 100 megabytes.
[01:49.47]Dude, I don't even need to change the name of the title.
[01:56.71]Trying out this new game, right?
[02:01.10]Hello.
[02:02.84]Alright, how are the options look?
[02:05.42]Is this a controller game?
[02:08.12]Thank you.
[02:08.56]I can turn that off.
[02:16.77]Alright.
[02:20.39]Should I do controller or should I do mouse keyboard?
[02:30.28]Controller?
[02:30.68]Okay.
[02:31.48]This is the only character that I have.
[02:32.68]Standard mode, endless mode.
[02:33.92]Standard mode.
[02:34.44]10 minute survival.
[02:36.62]Alright.
[02:37.86]20 minutes standard mode.
[02:38.90]Yeah.
[02:45.04]Okay.
[02:46.44]Click to shoot.
[02:47.94]It's right trigger to shoot.
[02:49.08]I actually would probably prefer a mouse and keyboard.
[02:53.46]Yeah, definitely.
[02:54.70]Oh yeah, without a doubt.
[02:55.40]Hold on.
[02:57.20]I need to turn the sensitivity down.
[03:01.30]Can I turn the sensitivity down?
[03:14.51]Auto aim.
[03:15.47]Oh, okay.
[03:25.78]This is fun.
[03:31.85]Choose an upgrade.
[03:32.59]Double shot?
[03:36.77]Dark arts.
[03:40.65]Ooh, it's like a crit.
[03:42.87]Bullet speed, max vitality, ghost friend.
[03:46.49]Yeah.
[03:48.53]Ghost friend.
[03:52.36]This is a full-on genre now.
[03:55.78]That actually makes me really happy, because Vampire Survivors is so fucking fun.
[04:00.83]This type of game is so fun.
[04:01.91]I hope these guys make millions of dollars setting this genre, right?
[04:09.29]I hope they make millions of dollars.
[04:12.72]And then it's like, okay, a bunch of people are making games that are like this too, but it's alright.
[04:16.76]You got a huge bag.
[04:19.94]Alright, I hope they make a lot of money.
[04:23.72]This game is called Garlic Likes.
[04:25.90]Really?
[04:31.65]I like that.
[04:32.11]Rapid fire.
[04:36.61]Let's go.
[04:49.06]I'm dead.
[04:49.60]No, I'm not.
[04:50.00]Alright, hold on.
[04:51.42]Energetic friend.
[04:52.24]Summon attack speed plus 50%.
[04:53.92]That sounds good.
[04:56.89]Oh, I see.
[04:57.31]And it also unlocks stuff.
[05:00.85]Dragon egg?
[05:03.17]Oh, fuck yeah.
[05:05.09]This thing hatches into a dragon in three minutes?
[05:24.09]Fuck, I'm dead.
[05:24.43]This game's awesome.
[05:25.47]Shit.
[05:27.43]Okay, this game's cool.
[05:28.51]Okay, let's do it again.
[05:31.24]Let's do it again.
[05:31.68]This game's fun.
[05:41.57]That's two hits.
[05:58.82]move speed is essential it feels like it yeah because there's not really any reliable way to get away are there upgrades in this game after like afterwards yes there is oh my god I love this game
[06:13.31]other one was good too but this one feel okay here's the thing the difference between the last game and this one is from the very beginning of that last one that we just played I felt just powerful I was so powerful almost already I was just destroying everything I just got my ass kicked I didn't even make it five minutes
[06:35.32]I like that better.
[06:36.28]I like the game needs to really progress, progress, progress, progress until you get to that point where it's just crazy.
[06:45.42]It almost gives you an opportunity to learn the game better.
[06:48.35]Alright, let's see.
[06:51.45]Reload rate, fire rate, yeah.
[06:53.37]Wait, no, let me see everything else.
[07:03.06]I think I like this one.
[07:14.91]Vampire Survivors get a lot more difficult as you progressed.
[07:18.07]Oh, yeah, I did.
[07:22.11]I shoot the tree.
[07:23.29]Oh, alright.
[07:30.22]Pick up range is always good.
[07:36.72]That's a good.
[07:39.71]Oh, should I just do super reload, Andy?
[07:43.93]Yeah.
[07:58.44]I do appreciate you can see the ammo on the cursor.
[08:01.66]That's huge.
[08:17.25]I gotta collect some shit here, otherwise I'm gonna be in trouble.
[08:19.55]Alright, double shot sounds good with this.
[08:29.36]Oh, move speed.
[08:30.02]But didn't you guys say this is important?
[08:36.21]I probably should do it.
[08:41.95]I'm already starting to slow down.
[08:43.01]Yeah, I'll do it.
[08:52.78]That's definitely a huge increase.
[08:54.02]Yeah, this is much better.
[09:07.14]When are you going to unbox an Xbox One?
[09:11.46]Now, that's actually really funny.
[09:15.61]I do an Xbox One unboxing video.
[09:22.47]The Halo Edition with Master Chief on it.
[09:25.19]Right.
[09:25.37]That would be actually pretty funny.
[09:26.35]I'm into that.
[09:29.00]Wow.
[09:35.24]Am I going am I going super fast right now?
[10:17.44]Uh-oh.
[10:19.58]What's that?
[10:37.79]I like this setup.
[10:38.67]I like the build.
[10:41.73]Ooh.
[10:42.23]Alright, I gotta get some of that.
[10:43.89]Alright, time to collect.
[10:56.16]It's simple.
[10:57.88]Yeah, it is simple, but that's a good thing.
[11:01.51]I think I'm doing double shot.
[11:03.87]Yeah.
[11:04.39]Bullet damage, but I think that's fine.
[11:18.34]Alright, let's really start to snowball here.
[11:19.80]HP...
[11:28.41]Increase bullet damage and move speed by 10% every 10 seconds.
[11:32.72]This resets when you get hit.
[11:34.74]Oh my god, that's actually huge.
[11:35.94]40% and just don't get hit.
[11:41.57]Egg.
[11:41.67]Egg.
[12:01.44]There we go.
[12:02.02]That's what I wanted.
[12:02.62]Don't get greedy.
[12:06.31]I got greedy.
[12:09.97]Your dragon gains 8 damage every 60 seconds.
[12:12.27]This ability works even if your dragon is still in the egg.
[12:15.70]Egg salad?
[12:16.14]Increase reload rate by 5% for every enemy killed.
[12:23.06]That's okay.
[12:26.30]That's kinda cool.
[12:28.10]That's kinda cool.
[12:28.78]Should I just... I think I'm gonna go for the dragon.
[12:33.24]It's gonna stay alive.
[12:35.43]Oh shit, I'm gonna die.
[12:36.27]Alright, I gotta focus.
[12:51.43]No more talking.
[13:20.24]What the fuck is that?
[13:21.40]Alright.
[13:21.76]Holy shield.
[13:24.50]Health.
[13:30.52]I think I need this.
[13:34.42]I got one health.
[13:41.18]Ooh.
[13:45.74]Enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every two seconds.
[13:53.60]I gotta stay alive, though.
[13:57.49]Oh my god.
[13:59.77]Three halo pieces can now appear as upgrade choices.
[14:02.41]Collect all three to recover Shana's halo.
[14:07.13]Okay.
[14:08.95]Is someone else in there?
[14:10.85]Oh my god!
[14:11.87]Okay, that was... I died.
[14:13.73]Shit.
[14:14.19]Alright, that was fun.
[14:20.74]Let's go.
[14:32.21]Get the upgrade to the main menu.
[14:33.43]I'll do one more and then we'll go there.
[14:42.07]Fuck, I really like this.
[14:44.99]When did this come out?
[14:45.87]A couple months ago?
[14:57.22]Why did it take me so long to understand that it existed?
[15:04.50]I got 20 in the recommended Discord channel.
[15:07.44]20 play Freddy Fish 3.
[15:09.46]But no, no play this one?
[15:17.45]I think we're going Electro.
[15:21.70]Let's try it.
[15:22.26]Every second shot.
[15:28.04]That's awesome.
[15:37.35]Alright, magic lens, quick hands.
[15:40.97]Let's go with the health right off the bat.
[15:42.39]This is the one.
[15:46.71]This is the run.
[15:47.87]We're going to get to at least 15 minutes or 10 minutes.
[15:53.76]I need some rapid fire, though, so the lightning happens more often.
[16:03.73]No mass.
[16:22.06]Alright, give me something good.
[16:24.78]Max HP plus 2, character size plus 50%.
[16:28.12]I don't know if I like that.
[16:31.72]Ooh.
[16:33.19]Egg.
[16:33.59]No.
[16:35.15]I want lightning.
[16:41.97]Okay, when lightning strikes an enemy, there's a 20% chance to automatically refill 3 ammo.
[16:45.30]Let's do it.
[16:52.06]I wonder how often that's gonna happen.
[16:57.42]Hasn't happened yet.
[16:58.04]There we go.
[17:01.23]It's pretty good.
[17:20.90]That's good, but I need reload speed.
[17:24.73]Summon an electro bug that calls down lightning to strike two nearby enemies.
[17:30.89]Rapid fire or electro bug?
[17:32.55]Let's do it.
[17:38.88]That's good that it just passively does that.
[17:40.80]Ooh.
[17:57.74]Power shot.
[17:58.94]Nice.
[18:01.36]All lightning damage increased by 12.
[18:04.08]Increased lightning area effect by 75%.
[18:05.72]Yeah.
[18:08.45]Lightning build.
[18:08.95]Let's do it.
[18:14.75]Now I need rapid fire and more ammo.
[18:31.96]Double shot.
[18:32.62]Ooh, yep.
[18:36.84]Does that count as two?
[18:37.60]It does, right?
[18:42.44]Oh, it doesn't count as two.
[18:43.32]I think it's that one.
[19:02.41]Yeah, I need the movement speed plus the fire rate.
[19:22.58]Thank you.
[19:25.80]Three Halo pieces can now appear.
[19:29.10]Take it.
[19:29.40]Is that... Dude, what the fuck just happened?
[19:33.42]I just got bounced around like crazy.
[19:34.74]Bullet speed, fire rate, that's what I want.
[19:40.95]Oh, yeah.
[19:41.43]Alright, as long as I don't act like a bonehead, I should be fine here.
[20:10.00]Ooh.
[20:13.14]Ooh.
[20:14.72]Does this count?
[20:17.84]It's not fun when Jerm is not being stupid.
[20:22.23]Man, sometimes we're just chilling, dude.
[20:26.07]Dude, if you step on the gas and you go 100 miles per hour the whole time, you're going to run out of gas and your car is going to break down.
[20:35.06]You're going to refuel sometimes.
[20:42.92]Magnets, good.
[20:45.23]Yeah, that's a good choice.
[21:00.67]Oh, yeah.
[21:05.95]Yeah, you don't want the car to run out of gas.
[21:17.69]How many times have you said gas today?
[21:19.44]At least ten.
[21:20.16]Alright, I want that.
[21:24.46]Or... That.
[21:32.59]What is the... Is the vision ray in this big circle around me?
[21:42.24]We haven't come to Pittsburgh.
[21:43.32]Dude, I was there yesterday.
[21:46.38]I was there yesterday.
[21:47.24]I got a fucking steak and cheese.
[21:48.72]I got a Philly cheese steak.
[21:55.48]You missed me by like four hours.
[22:10.87]Wrong city.
[22:12.92]Well, you don't think that they have famous cheese steaks in other cities in that state?
[22:20.45]Well, you think it's only exclusive to Philly?
[22:26.00]They do, but they suck.
[22:27.18]What?
[22:27.40]Hmm.
[22:42.15]Probably this one.
[22:47.71]You called it a Philly cheesesteak.
[22:50.56]Yeah?
[22:50.76]And if I order New York-style pizza, the person behind the counter is not gonna go, Hey, you know this is buffalo.
[23:04.52]Oh, no, no, no, sorry.
[23:06.12]Hey, you know you're in Cincinnati, dude.
[23:07.80]If it's a New York-style pizza.
[23:10.82]New York City-style pizza?
[23:13.30]You're an idiot.
[23:13.74]You don't even know what city you're in.
[23:15.78]I just fucking lost because of that.
[23:25.15]Oh, my eye!
[23:33.55]That was such a good run too.
[23:35.05]Banned that person for seven days.
[23:47.40]Billy cheese rant.
[23:49.00]Yeah, if you make a Philly cheese... Dude, you can't just be like... Oh, hey.
[23:53.42]Oh, hey, Grandpa.
[23:54.28]How are you?
[23:54.76]I'm doing very good.
[23:55.66]Oh, man.
[23:57.14]Hi.
[23:57.24]Are you going to make me your famous Philly cheesesteak?
[24:00.02]Yes, I'm going to make you a Philly cheesesteak.
[24:01.84]I know how to make it really good.
[24:03.22]Did you even grow up in Philadelphia?
[24:06.76]No, I didn't.
[24:08.38]I just know how to make them really good.
[24:09.92]And I have family there.
[24:11.70]Did you grow up in Philly?
[24:14.54]No, I'm sorry.
[24:15.44]I didn't mean to.
[24:16.34]Is it auto?
[24:17.22]No, it's not.
[24:31.95]Alright, I want to do something cool like this.
[24:56.96]I got a famous salmon I'd like to make.
[24:58.80]I got a famous egg salad I want to make for you.
[25:01.92]Are those even your eggs?
[25:10.35]I'm sorry.
[25:36.03]Remember, that's disgusting.
[25:38.79]Well, that's kind of something.
[25:40.98]Look.
[25:43.80]Ooh, I like that.
[25:49.27]But this synergizes better.
[26:14.84]Alright, more, more, more.
[26:15.80]Should I go for the egg?
[26:16.55]Alright, I'm actually going to go for the egg.
[26:19.03]And not be a moron.
[26:54.41]We're good.
[26:56.65]Alright, I think I can comfortably... Yeah, that one.
[27:12.55]Whoa, tree!
[27:25.84]Damage 35%, yup.
[27:26.68]We're going straight up just bullet damage.
[27:59.79]Will it bounce?
[28:00.75]Alright, I gotta think about going somewhere else.
[28:02.59]So it will bounce off of people.
[28:10.19]Hey, I've been performing some rituals on you and just wanted to know if you still had ten toes.
[28:13.38]Yes, I do.
[28:16.62]Please do a ritual where I have a healthy life and shit.
[28:20.30]Like, come on.
[28:22.19]Do some rituals where I'm... Like, I learn how to, like, figure skate or ice skate or something, right?
[28:27.13]Like, get something interesting.
[28:28.27]Let me do something cool.
[28:30.05]Stop removing toes and shit.
[28:31.79]Like, stop.
[28:34.53]You know, next time you're at the altar or whatever it is, just be like, you know what?
[28:39.57]Let's make something cool.
[28:40.77]Let's do something.
[28:41.93]Maybe, like, he... He eats, like, a really good piece of pizza tomorrow or something, right?
[28:45.93]Like, come on.
[28:48.81]Enough of this bullshit.
[28:50.45]Enough of the bullshit.
[29:04.17]Don't go over there.
[29:08.51]Gun mastery?
[29:10.37]Wait, did I just... Alright, yeah.
[29:15.68]That sounds pretty amazing.
[29:20.20]Alright, this is actually the run, so I'm not going to blow it.
[29:31.21]Quick learner.
[29:31.94]Increase experience gain by 40%.
[29:33.28]Yep.
[29:35.56]Okay.
[29:36.14]That's where... Alright.
[29:41.20]Really?
[29:41.51]Ooh!
[29:45.23]The dragon's coming out soon, right?
[30:00.55]That experience thing is insane.
[30:05.17]Reload rate 5%.
[30:06.47]Bullet damage by 50% for one second after reloading.
[30:12.05]Reload rate by 5% for every enemy killed.
[30:14.09]This resets after reloading.
[30:16.07]No, we'll do this one.
[30:18.39]Yeah.
[30:37.45]Yep.
[30:37.71]Okay.
[30:40.19]Dragon.
[30:41.11]Bullet speed.
[30:42.50]Ghost friend.
[30:44.80]Dragon bond.
[30:48.86]This one.
[30:51.16]Dragon does more damage, even when he's in the egg.
[31:05.37]Can you actually kill the trees, or is that just a waste of time?
[31:15.51]Jesus.
[31:27.33]Whoa!
[31:27.73]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[31:34.54]Damage 45% and huge size.
[31:38.35]Yes.
[31:42.05]Fuck!
[31:42.61]Alright, this is getting hard.
[31:48.39]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[31:51.12]Choose an upgrade.
[31:56.82]Bullet damage minus 50%.
[31:59.62]But burn, lightning, and freeze duration by threat.
[32:02.56]I don't have any of that.
[32:03.96]Summon damage by 50%.
[32:05.40]Summon attack speed, but my reload rate is awful.
[32:09.28]Board.
[32:09.60]Bullet damage, bullet size.
[32:10.80]Yeah, it's got to be this one, right?
[32:12.75]Max HP.
[32:13.43]Is that going to kill me?
[32:20.67]This won't kill me?
[32:40.28]Is the area getting smaller?
[32:43.79]I'm not getting Fortnited, am I?
[32:52.83]Definitely this one.
[33:20.74]I'm really glad their enemy projectiles are red.
[33:37.39]Movement speed.
[33:41.87]I don't know.
[33:48.21]Probably this one.
[33:49.85]Just more.
[33:52.54]More piercing, more damage.
[34:00.55]Oh!
[34:05.96]That was close.
[34:41.38]I think I need to take it.
[34:45.39]I do.
[35:05.75]I got so much shit over there to go pick up.
[35:07.33]Let's run him over here.
[35:33.45]Enemies explode into three bullets when killed.
[35:36.79]Huge.
[35:44.63]That's good too, though.
[35:46.49]I'm gonna do this.
[35:49.21]They explode when killed.
[35:50.85]That's 10% damage.
[35:55.43]Holy shit, that's unbelievable.
[35:56.89]Alright, just don't blow it.
[36:09.99]There's so many bullets everywhere.
[36:18.49]So I got a question.
[36:19.95]Does this include way too dank?
[36:27.04]Does that count for the little bolts that are coming out from the explosion?
[36:34.90]It does.
[36:35.30]OK, that sounds kind of crazy.
[36:37.14]Yeah.
[36:52.91]Jesus when shooting your last ammo also shoot 10 bullets in a circle oh hell yeah
[37:23.42]Oh my god.
[37:24.12]Okay.
[37:31.74]This one's probably good too now.
[37:36.21]Yeah.
[37:36.99]All enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every 2 seconds.
[37:40.81]Or take the shield.
[37:43.67]That's probably a good idea.
[38:02.65]Alright, it's getting kind of crazy here.
[38:04.09]Bullet speed plus 30%.
[38:05.01]I'm going to take the moving speed.
[38:08.93]I feel like I need it.
[38:19.23]So many experience gems everywhere.
[38:29.37]Pick up range.
[38:51.23]Bullet speed.
[38:53.85]Reload rate and move speed by 25% while Holy Shield is active.
[38:56.95]Um, yeah.
[39:01.46]Wow.
[39:10.62]Alright, this is definitely the one.
[39:11.54]Looks like I got killed by a boss or something.
[39:24.91]On every fifth shot, launch a fireball that deals 40 damage.
[39:27.41]Flicks burn as well.
[39:29.17]I think I'm going to do maybe speed.
[39:35.61]Or I'll do fire.
[39:36.29]Yeah, this one.
[39:37.84]This one.
[39:38.12]Alright, that's a new enemy.
[40:05.40]shit oh but it's so bad I think it's this one why is it happening twice why is that happening twice that shouldn't be happening twice am I just getting really lucky or something
[40:52.10]Oh yes.
[41:39.96]Let's go.
[41:42.96]Walk speed.
[41:44.88]Ghost friend.
[41:46.86]Pick up range.
[41:49.44]Alright, I'll do ghost friend.
[42:01.37]Alright, whatever that is, I gotta be careful.
[42:07.25]My ears are itching.
[42:42.76]alright what is it triple the effect of the next upgrade you take oh my god alright what is it I mean wait that'll I'll die minus three that I'll it'll kill me 300 walk speed though that would be crazy
[43:26.03]That's your speed well shooting.
[43:28.83]I mean, that's still amazing.
[43:30.89]I could re-roll it.
[43:34.73]Should I try to re-roll it?
[43:43.92]So this will shoot three bullets behind me.
[43:47.16]Wait.
[43:50.23]So hold on a minute.
[43:50.87]This will shoot three bullets behind me every time I click.
[44:00.36]It sucks.
[44:02.70]I'm doing it.
[44:09.84]How come it's not shooting three?
[44:16.23]Didn't it say it triples the effect?
[44:19.27]Oh.
[44:20.11]I got scammed.
[44:22.51]Oh well.
[44:23.95]I got seven minutes.
[44:24.76]I'm fine.
[44:27.54]It's three stacked together.
[44:30.35]Is it?
[44:31.63]I think it actually might be.
[44:32.75]Yeah, no, it is.
[44:33.35]It is.
[44:33.97]It definitely is.
[44:35.01]See what it's doing?
[44:36.29]Yeah, it is three.
[44:37.51]No, we didn't get to see him.
[44:38.23]It's game.
[44:38.45]We're good.
[44:42.60]Yeah, it's definitely three.
[45:13.41]Maybe it's time for lightning.
[45:57.32]Okay, but is that really that good?
[46:01.36]So max HP, it'll take away one of the empty ones.
[46:11.03]So that's just a free plus 10 more damage.
[46:13.57]Okay, I'm doing it.
[46:23.95]I can already tell a difference.
[46:26.42]Worth it.
[46:52.82]Five minutes, we're almost there.
[47:09.35]Uh, is that zero?
[47:12.09]Reload rate, bullet damage crazy, but max ammo, wouldn't that make my max ammo zero?
[47:22.54]I would have one ammo.
[47:26.27]No, no way.
[47:28.69]You will spin so much, though.
[47:33.43]Should I go for it?
[47:35.17]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[47:47.86]Alright, turns out it was worth it.
[47:52.70]Oh shit.
[48:19.46]Actually not great for right now because I can't aim.
[48:22.96]I would love to aim at these guys.
[48:53.69]No!
[49:08.82]Shit, I was so close.
[49:10.36]I think that kind of screwed me.
[49:12.10]Because I couldn't aim at the individual people shooting the bullets.
[49:18.83]Damn it.
[49:19.21]It's alright.
[49:21.31]Wait, this is this stuff.
[49:22.55]Shotgun?
[49:23.07]Oh, this is awesome.
[49:25.56]Really, there's so much to do.
[49:26.94]I'm gonna turn this down.
[49:38.40]Like, it's bright.
[49:44.52]Okay.
[49:45.38]Um, who should I unlock?
[49:53.28]On every third shot, throw out a wave of fire that burns enemies.
[49:56.14]That's kind of cool.
[49:58.10]Starts with more HP.
[50:02.88]Right click to summon a shadow clone.
[50:12.54]Starts with lightning.
[50:17.98]That's pretty good.
[50:21.37]Right click to quickly shoot all of your remaining ammo in random directions.
[50:24.92]That's kind of cool too.
[50:25.80]Is there more?
[50:28.34]There's more.
[50:31.64]Alright, I'm gonna... Alright, we're gonna save our money for a second here.
[50:39.77]Let's do the one... Alright, more HP.
[50:42.47]Let's do this one.
[50:44.93]And... Shotgun.
[50:47.62]I love shotguns.
[50:50.45]I like that.
[50:51.45]Crossbow, that's kind of cool.
[50:58.07]Ooh, I like that too.
[51:01.86]Alright, I'm going to go with shotgun.
[51:05.90]Wait a minute.
[51:11.04]Oh.
[51:13.91]Sword or shield?
[51:17.23]Do I have to go in order?
[51:18.13]Oh, okay, rank one.
[51:22.43]I think I'm going to go with this.
[51:26.23]Pickup range is huge.
[51:33.49]That's 3, 6, 9, 12.
[51:38.06]Alright, that's 15% pickup range.
[51:40.58]I think I'm cool with that.
[51:47.64]Bullet damage and summon damage.
[51:48.85]I mean, just do more damage, right?
[51:53.42]I think this is the one to do.
[51:57.60]Yeah, okay.
[51:58.16]Alright.
[52:00.70]Let's go for it.
[52:01.22]I got the shotgun.
[52:01.88]I got a diamond.
[52:03.56]Let's do it.
[52:07.44]Alright, this is the one.
[52:11.95]You didn't have to stop aiming.
[52:13.17]Well, the problem is I only had one shot.
[52:15.13]And if I... How many bullets do I have?
[52:17.43]That's two.
[52:32.31]Okay.
[52:34.35]Uh, fire rate.
[52:37.61]Bullet damage.
[52:38.15]I'm gonna do butt damage and knockback with the shotgun.
[52:40.01]That seems like a good idea.
[52:44.39]My face is itchy!
[52:55.72]Stop!
[53:06.99]I kind of want this.
[53:08.63]Enemies in your vision take 25 damage every 2 seconds.
[53:14.75]Now the vision is... Which circle?
[53:19.47]Oh, it's the little circle.
[53:20.68]Okay, I'm not happy about that, but whatever.
[53:23.72]That's okay.
[53:24.86]I thought it was the big circle.
[53:45.05]I mean, it's a shotgun, so might as well.
[54:05.98]Actually, the vision thing is actually doing pretty good.
[54:12.34]This is a little bit more, it's more damage than the shotgun's doing.
[54:29.84]Rapid fire shotgun.
[54:30.64]Alright, what should I get for food today?
[54:47.05]What do you guys think?
[54:49.31]Somebody said Taco Bell.
[54:50.99]They were going to get it, but I kind of screwed that up for them.
[54:56.93]Oh, yeah.
[54:58.53]Double shotgun blast?
[55:01.62]Is it actually firing double?
[55:03.68]I can't tell.
[55:08.08]Is it?
[55:15.96]Just plus one.
[55:19.99]Oh, it's the fifth projectile, OK.
[55:40.33]Movement speed.
[55:44.49]Good to get it early.
[55:45.23]Mmm.
[55:59.61]Vision range plus 15.
[56:00.61]The damage from glare also applies the on-hit effects on your bullets.
[56:06.66]Oh, okay.
[56:07.12]So I have to get burn or freeze or something, right?
[56:11.55]Oh, come on.
[56:14.15]Dude, stop.
[56:14.89]What am I doing?
[56:15.41]I'm blowing it.
[56:38.32]We got.
[56:39.89]Increase bullet damage and bullet size by 15% permanently every time you heal.
[56:44.98]Whoa.
[56:45.52]I'm about to get hit.
[57:02.80]Shield.
[57:05.81]So I have to start healing.
[57:09.19]How do you heal though reliably?
[57:11.67]All I see is max HP.
[57:13.09]I haven't seen heal HP yet.
[57:16.11]Am I doing something wrong not healing somehow?
[57:22.77]The fire path heals?
[57:29.69]Fire and HP plus, okay.
[57:37.35]twice as much glare.
[57:39.69]I'll do freeze because I need it.
[57:40.81]Because a glare will inflict freeze, right?
[58:10.85]Very helpful.
[58:35.78]Okay.
[58:40.75]This one?
[58:41.09]You can get a healing fruit if you kill a tree.
[58:47.78]Oh.
[58:48.54]Good to know.
[59:15.63]Does the eye have to be open for it to take damage?
[59:24.49]Jeez.
[59:25.01]Okay.
[59:31.58]He only talks to us when he needs us.
[59:36.40]Well, I'm focusing.
[59:37.84]I have to pay attention.
[59:39.08]Probably going to do this.
[59:48.76]Or should I do ghost?
[60:23.78]Stop!
[60:24.46]The freeze made me run into you!
[60:32.74]Shit!
[60:34.20]Alright, I'm losing it here.
[60:45.31]Okay, there we go.
[60:50.14]I mean, that's probably the one to do.
[60:55.22]Yeah.
[61:03.31]Reload rate.
[61:05.41]Max ammo is big.
[61:07.45]I can shoot three times, right?
[61:10.25]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[61:21.24]Oh my god, I'm absolutely blowing it.
[61:23.06]I'm moving so fast.
[61:26.18]The movement speed made me run in.
[61:28.18]I don't know if I want the movement speed.
[61:29.60]It's too fast.
[61:33.21]I wasn't prepared for it.
[61:34.07]I just ran into that person twice.
[61:35.61]Alright, I'll pull it together.
[62:41.60]Have to take a healing thing?
[62:42.74]I know.
[62:47.48]It's this one.
[62:55.76]I gotta kill one of these trees.
[63:13.92]I thought he was dead.
[63:14.58]That was almost death.
[63:40.58]This one?
[63:45.63]I think so.
[63:50.28]Trees have so much health.
[63:51.40]Should I not even be trying?
[63:56.49]I'm definitely in trouble though.
[63:57.45]I'm not doing enough damage.
[64:34.85]Alright, give me a level.
[64:47.45]Alright.
[64:48.28]Health?
[64:57.10]Shield, probably?
[64:57.94]I mean, it has to be the shield, because if I take a hit...
[65:05.23]For a curse that's just crit, I'll do it.
[65:09.52]I'm in so much trouble though.
[65:37.99]Oh, glare and curse work together really well.
[65:41.53]Alright, I see what you mean.
[65:42.27]I have to take it.
[65:59.48]I have to.
[66:10.11]Because don't I get a bonus for that?
[66:11.27]Just try to level up glare the whole way.
[66:40.31]The only thing that's keeping me alive.
[66:41.41]I think I'm going to get overwhelmed when it's all these sucker things.
[67:26.35]Alright, that's back.
[67:27.07]I don't like any of these.
[67:50.98]I don't like any of these, but splinter is probably the best one.
[68:34.12]Oh shit, this thing.
[69:27.38]I need a level.
[70:28.87]Ah, there's nothing I can do.
[70:30.95]I'm so screwed.
[70:31.87]I just couldn't kill anything.
[70:33.69]Shit.
[70:34.35]Alright, I'm gonna do that one.
[70:35.33]One more.
[70:35.87]One more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[70:42.98]Uh... Character's good.
[70:44.80]I'm gonna try this.
[70:49.52]I'm gonna try the crossbow.
[70:56.79]Bullet damage.
[70:57.83]That counts as a crossbow, right?
[70:58.99]Alright, let's go again.
[71:05.56]I feel like I'm going to like this.
[71:07.00]You charge it.
[71:13.99]This thing does a lot of damage.
[71:19.63]Pierces everybody too.
[71:25.05]I like it a lot, actually.
[71:27.47]We just need a ton of damage.
[71:30.81]Why do his eyes look like that?
[71:32.09]Like what?
[71:36.39]Okay, so technically it's one shot, so this would be awesome.
[71:43.35]Right?
[71:44.85]Smite everybody after shooting your last shot.
[71:47.67]I have one shot, so... Yes.
[71:52.51]Precisely what I thought.
[72:07.88]This is my weapon.
[72:15.19]Okay.
[72:15.85]That's cool.
[72:19.71]I think I'm going with magnetism.
[72:23.16]Early.
[72:24.02]Make sure I don't have to worry about it later.
[72:31.66]You can hold it for a long time.
[72:34.68]Wow.
[72:35.14]Alright.
[72:35.46]I didn't know that.
[72:42.43]You can probably chew through in a whole line of enemies like that.
[72:45.03]Alright.
[72:52.47]Yes.
[72:55.13]Double shot.
[72:56.65]Oh fuck yeah.
[72:58.79]That's disgusting.
[73:00.07]That is disgusting.
[73:18.74]Okay.
[73:21.78]A shop behind me too?
[73:24.22]I think so.
[73:43.12]Who said this sucks?
[73:44.48]I don't know if I agree with you.
[73:56.83]Dark Arts?
[74:00.21]That could be good.
[74:06.21]Whoa, yep.
[74:08.43]This is one shot.
[74:16.54]Although it's only doing two damage, though.
[74:17.90]That's kind of bad.
[74:30.64]It doesn't scale with the charge, unfortunately.
[74:33.32]100% that.
[74:48.59]Yeah.
[74:53.39]Reload rate is absolutely key here.
[75:15.94]Ghost friend.
[75:17.92]More reload.
[75:18.58]Max ammo.
[75:19.38]Wait a minute.
[75:20.04]That's probably not a good idea.
[75:22.44]Or is it a good idea?
[75:26.46]Don't tell him.
[75:27.42]Don't tell me what.
[75:38.75]Take the lens.
[75:42.72]Give all bullets a pass through 30% damage in size.
[75:46.50]Oh, that's right.
[75:47.02]Oh, I see.
[75:50.67]One of these things.
[76:14.46]I didn't know he was right next to me.
[76:24.55]Alright, what is this one going to be?
[76:26.51]Bullet damage and bullet size permanently every time you heal.
[76:29.31]Alright.
[76:30.95]I got to pick up that other thing then.
[76:35.99]Where's that?
[76:36.45]Where is it?
[76:42.02]To bounce?
[76:53.65]Do the fire.
[76:54.49]Pyro Mage.
[76:57.84]Not bounce.
[76:58.40]Pyro.
[76:58.80]Okay.
[77:10.70]Or at least I can kill shit this time.
[77:15.21]I was having a lot of trouble killing anything last time.
[77:34.61]Also, pass through your magic lens will inflict burn.
[77:38.66]Pick up range, vision range.
[77:41.00]I mean, that's probably a good one to take.
[78:09.95]Kill a tree.
[78:12.89]Huh?
[78:16.04]Tree, tree, tree, tree.
[78:17.16]What do you mean tree?
[78:17.80]What happened?
[78:20.86]Get the freeze so you can kill a tree.
[78:22.36]Uh...
[78:45.38]That's three arrows.
[78:50.02]Less damage, but that seems kind of amazing.
[78:58.92]It is.
[79:15.31]It's plus four projectiles.
[79:16.83]Get out of the way!
[79:24.55]Dude!
[79:29.18]Get out of the fucking way!
[79:34.16]Why am I so slow?
[80:11.60]This one's big.
[80:14.65]This is big.
[80:15.39]I gotta be very careful.
[80:17.25]Please be careful.
[80:20.12]This is massive.
[80:21.52]That's a massive deal.
[81:03.43]Yes.
[81:07.03]I need the heals.
[81:56.73]Sorry, I'm quiet Andy right now.
[82:00.20]But I gotta get to the end.
[82:10.15]As much damage as your bullets.
[82:20.14]Probably this, right?
[82:30.25]Reload rate.
[82:30.85]That's fire rate.
[82:35.46]Do the dagger.
[82:36.82]Alright, we'll do the magic dagger.
[82:39.10]I have to remember that that's my projectile.
[82:45.55]I will confuse it.
[83:05.76]I went around the tree!
[83:07.12]I'm pissed.
[83:11.04]I think it's this one.
[84:47.25]Monstrous.
[84:50.93]Just take the health.
[84:54.76]So there's just 20.
[84:56.08]Just take the extra health.
[84:57.42]I'm taking it.
[85:21.75]So I'm gonna magic scythe.
[85:22.95]Hold speed.
[85:30.24]Shield.
[85:31.59]Yeah!
[85:59.50]Bullet damage and fire rate when you get hit.
[86:02.55]That one's pretty good.
[86:03.53]I think this one's good.
[86:06.37]10 extra damage, 30 extra damage.
[86:08.07]Yep.
[86:45.09]Let's go.
[86:49.26]Oh my god.
[86:50.76]Reload rate and speed.
[86:52.68]Reload rate.
[87:02.26]Am I at the cap?
[87:15.98]Holy shit.
[87:17.18]Bullet damage and knockback?
[87:18.74]Yup.
[87:38.17]How come I haven't healed yet?
[87:40.76]Don't I have something that heals every time somebody dies by something?
[87:49.54]Curse, too, would be insane.
[87:51.22]Summon damage?
[87:51.87]That's... That's definitely Curse.
[88:04.70]How come you don't blink?
[88:05.62]I haven't?
[88:05.92]I feel like I have.
[88:09.22]I'm doing Curse.
[88:11.68]Holy shit, I probably... I don't think I have blinked.
[88:15.16]Oh my god, you're right.
[88:17.35]Hold on, give me a second.
[88:23.11]Jesus.
[88:23.45]We're good.
[88:25.23]I just like made my that has made it worse.
[89:49.03]We got... Fire rate and reload rate by 10% permanently every time you get hit.
[89:55.08]Okay, that's okay, I guess.
[90:31.30]This is such a great build.
[90:33.10]I can't lose it now.
[90:33.98]I gotta play smart.
[90:49.03]Oh, I don't like that.
[90:54.93]That's, I mean, doubled though?
[91:01.12]Better shield.
[91:01.70]I think that's the safe play.
[91:05.59]Not the cool play, but it's the safe one.
[92:54.55]Burn.
[94:40.06]See you later.
[94:41.12]What do I got?
[94:45.24]Speed.
[94:47.84]Fire rate spread.
[94:51.68]Max ammo.
[94:53.00]Summon damage.
[94:54.94]It's just speed.
[94:59.13]Be careful.
[95:23.90]Feed damage.
[95:25.97]So yeah, hell yeah.
[96:01.12]I just want to kill it.
[96:01.68]I need to know what it is.
[96:12.19]My god, this thing's still alive.
[96:16.49]Yes.
[96:24.15]When diamonds, HP is at or below half of max HP, piercing +2 and knockback.
[96:29.37]Oh, well.
[96:35.58]Look at all these goodies over here.
[96:36.59]0.5% chance, okay.
[97:13.70]Two minutes.
[97:14.12]I feel like it's gonna get crazy here in a second.
[97:33.73]When Holy Shield is not active, kills with Smite lower the regeneration time for Holy Shield by one second.
[97:39.71]Damn, alright, that's amazing.
[98:02.11]Try to get to level 30, right?
[98:03.19]Probably important.
[98:41.61]Oh yeah, this is over.
[98:43.75]40 seconds.
[98:45.83]Nice.
[98:51.93]30 seconds.
[98:57.00]Good.
[99:05.28]Not level 30, but it's alright.
[99:33.10]Yeah!
[99:33.76]Hooray!
[99:34.24]10,000 currency.
[99:34.90]Nice.
[99:37.44]Very cool.
[99:44.64]Alright, let's do one more just joke one, right?
[99:47.26]Let's do one more crazy one.
[99:48.27]What do I want to unlock?
[99:50.59]Maybe the flamethrower?
[99:55.59]Okay, I'm gonna do flamethrower and the flame character.
[100:02.19]Okay.
[100:19.98]Darkness 1.
[100:22.16]Survive the night to unlock greater challenges.
[100:23.84]Small enemies spawn more often.
[100:27.69]I'll just do regular.
[100:28.29]This is fun to watch.
[100:31.60]It's kind of like Binding of Isaac.
[100:35.76]Oh my goodness, that's fast.
[100:36.78]This is a great character.
[100:44.22]I said joke character, but when I meant joke character, I meant joke weapons.
[100:49.57]This is not a joke character.
[100:54.43]Go darkness one to progress.
[100:56.59]That's alright.
[101:00.08]Oh, I restarted.
[101:01.08]I wasn't looking.
[101:05.14]That's the best gun in the whole game.
[101:13.29]Oh, you're betting.
[101:16.79]Sorry.
[101:17.15]Refund it.
[101:22.43]Refund it.
[101:30.06]You've ruined the bets.
[101:30.96]It's alright.
[101:31.72]We can refund.
[101:33.06]It'll work.
[101:38.68]The SMG is OP, too.
[101:42.57]Oh, wait.
[101:42.77]I can do another rune.
[101:45.31]I can't.
[101:46.39]Alright.
[101:47.11]Now you're betting on this one, okay?
[101:50.97]Same deal.
[101:52.01]Let's go.
[101:52.90]And I will do darkness one.
[102:09.96]You turned off the rune.
[102:10.98]Wait, don't bet yet.
[102:11.98]Wait, hold on.
[102:12.72]Did I turn off a rune?
[102:14.25]Oh, shit.
[102:14.97]Hold on.
[102:17.69]I unequipped the rune.
[102:19.07]Oh, okay.
[102:19.79]Well, we're going to restart.
[102:24.81]You can only pick one per tree.
[102:26.97]Oh, okay.

[103:12.75]Yeah, it's equipped.
[103:21.45]Okay.
[103:21.95]Here we go.
[103:22.37]Darkness 1.
[103:23.49]Rune is equipped.
[103:24.77]20 minutes.
[103:25.01]Let's go for it.
[103:25.59]This weapon's on...
[103:37.69]Oops.
[103:38.33]Oh, I was too busy.
[103:39.25]It's alright.
[103:40.00]They haven't even bet yet.
[104:00.99]Alright, I'm thinking fire rate, spread, and reload rate.
[104:05.99]Fire rate right here?
[104:07.39]Bingo.
[104:11.58]Oh my god.
[104:12.82]Oh my god, I'm so sorry everybody that's gonna lose.
[104:16.92]I'm not used to being this slow.
[104:35.32]Everything's fine.
[104:35.84]I think it's this one.
[104:45.25]Wait, burn?
[104:46.87]It's the burn character.
[104:53.22]Fire rate.
[104:58.12]I need reload rate bad.
[105:25.01]Reload right there it is.
[105:27.22]Oh double.
[105:29.82]I need to reload right bad.
[105:30.84]Don't worry believers, I got your back.
[107:10.26]Don't worry, Believers, I'm not giving in.
[107:42.47]I'm not giving in.
[108:54.98]It's drastic.
[108:56.08]It's drastic, but it should work out.
[109:25.87]Alright, what do we got?
[109:26.53]I got three health.
[109:27.08]I'm good.
[109:29.96]Burn damage plus 67%.
[109:32.56]Oh my goodness.
[109:34.92]Hey, Believers.
[109:35.52]I got you back.
[109:38.08]I almost walked into somebody, I think.
[109:47.57]Why did I narrate that part?
[109:49.90]Like, I got you.
[109:50.40]Back on, we just walked into somebody.
[109:52.14]Like, yeah, no shit.
[109:53.07]You fucking idiot.
[109:53.89]What are you talking about?
[109:54.99]Of course you... Oh!
[109:56.74]Oh!
[110:21.87]I'm sorry, Believers.
[110:22.69]I couldn't help it.
[110:23.25]I was just too slow.
[110:25.68]This thing's so fast.
[110:27.28]I'll win it back.
[110:27.78]I'll get it back.
[110:28.20]Just bet on me right now.
[110:29.78]Bet on me right now.
[110:30.38]I'll get it back right now.
[110:32.14]Bet on me right now.
[110:32.90]Bet on me right now.
[110:33.68]Bet on me right now.
[110:34.16]You lost.
[110:34.80]Bet on me right now.
[110:35.86]Bet on me right now.
[110:36.62]Bet right now.
[110:37.51]Bet on me right now.
[110:38.27]I'm telling you right now to bet on me.
[110:40.15]I am saying bet on me right fucking now.
[110:43.19]I'm going to go all 20 minutes.
[110:44.59]Bet on me.
[110:45.07]I'm telling you.
[110:45.85]Do it.
[110:47.07]Do it.
[110:48.31]Check this out.
[111:18.01]I'm telling you bet on me right now.
[111:37.66]I'm not fucking around.
[111:40.40]Not anymore.
[111:44.22]Yeah.
[111:45.62]Double shot.
[111:48.17]It just got real right now.
[111:55.28]Imagine being a non-believer right now after seeing what I just picked up.
[113:20.63]I believe in good, you should.
[113:22.77]I'm not going to be communicating that much with you.
[113:24.22]I'm trying to win you channel points.
[113:29.32]Communication is going to cease as of right now.
[113:43.65]Yep, that's burn effect.
[113:45.71]Glare puts on burn effect.
[113:49.31]Imagine spending money against me after what you- really?
[114:13.07]I mean if you bet against me at this point you- I mean you got like a- it's kind of full of fucking air.
[114:38.92]A lot of crunchies over here.
[115:31.46]Dude, if I win this, I deserve, I deserve McDonald's tonight.
[115:35.64]If I win.
[115:39.05]I'm just being really, really honest.
[115:41.75]I deserve five Happy Meals.
[116:07.95]Welcome to McDonald's.
[116:08.69]How can I help you?
[116:09.23]Oh, yeah.
[116:11.60]I'd like to get five Happy Meals, please.
[116:13.42]I don't have any kids.
[116:15.74]Should I say that?
[116:20.16]Oh, yeah.
[116:30.41]I don't have any kids.
[116:31.21]They're for me.
[116:31.73]Okay.
[116:34.09]I don't care, but pull around.
[116:49.41]Shut up!
[116:50.28]Not you.
[119:40.37]If you lose, you have to get one of the Gyros from Arby's.
[119:43.62]The world's grossest fast food item.
[120:00.49]That's not part of the deal.
[120:01.91]That could be the world's grossest fast food item.
[120:09.18]A gyro, gyro, there's a, I don't know, you know what I mean?
[120:17.90]Uh, that's my favorite comment of the whole night.
[120:20.53]Okay, if I, no, that's gross, I don't want to do that.
[120:28.39]Gyro, gyro, gyro, it's gyro.
[120:33.07]Stop, what do I pick?
[120:34.27]Just leave, I don't, they're gonna hate his work.
[120:41.25]Power, but bullets is not going to help.
[120:45.85]Can the fire bounce?
[120:48.65]I feel like that sucks.
[120:59.54]I think I'm just going to leave.
[121:00.42]I don't like any of these.
[121:01.84]Not for what I have right now.
[121:07.70]Bullet bounce +2, but can the fire even bounce off anything?
[121:15.42]This would be the one that I'd pick, but I don't really know if I want this.
[121:18.39]Well, let's, I mean, maybe this is alright.
[121:21.87]Bouncy fire.
[121:26.57]I'm just leaving.
[121:28.64]Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[121:29.70]That doesn't count.
[121:30.30]That actually doesn't count.
[121:31.14]I pressed D instead of S. That, I have to do it again because I pressed, I thought I was pressing S, but I was pressing D instead.
[121:38.91]I took too long on that dumbass screen.
[121:41.03]So, I pressed D. I was trying to hold S. Whatever, just bet on me again.
[121:45.18]I promise.
[121:45.76]Alright, this is the real one.
[121:47.76]This is the real one?
[121:49.12]If I lose, I have to get a fucking Euro from Arby's.
[121:52.24]And if I win, then I get my McDonald's Happy Meals.
[121:55.00]This is the real one.
[121:55.56]This is my bet.
[122:03.06]This one's for real.
[122:03.70]This one's for me.
[122:28.86]You have to eat it live on stream.
[122:30.53]No!
[122:32.51]I will take a picture of it.
[122:35.03]I will take a picture of at least two bites out of it.
[122:43.20]You know what's crazy?
[122:45.09]I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.
[122:47.29]I don't want that at all.
[122:49.25]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[122:50.73]I'm going to be silent now.
[122:52.39]I don't want to eat an Arby's gyro.
[122:55.13]I don't want that.
[122:55.89]That sounds awful to me right now.
[122:58.32]That's the last thing I want.
[122:59.24]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[123:02.22]Actually putting both headphones in for this.
[123:04.16]And I'm shutting up.
[123:04.72]I'm not going to talk the rest of the time I'm playing.
[124:28.45]Pyro does not sound like a good idea, though, because why would I get pyro?
[124:32.56]My bullets already inflict burn.
[124:34.46]Why would I do pyro?
[124:40.21]It stacks?
[124:40.93]Okay, I didn't know that.
[127:23.29]That's not good.
[129:36.96]It's dead?
[129:38.28]Oh shit, I killed it.
[129:46.04]Yes.
[130:35.34]Oh my goodness.
[130:41.88]Sick super fast rate.
[130:45.22]Triple base max ammo.
[130:47.77]I get to have McDonald's today.
[131:08.56]Alright, let's go.
[131:19.75]I need burn damage, burn damage, burn damage, burn damage.
[131:22.63]If I see burn damage up, I need it.
[132:07.44]Shit.
[132:14.67]I don't know.
[132:16.24]It's probably Galaria.
[132:48.30]I need lightning too.
[132:49.20]The lightning is going to be... The lightning is doing so much work here.
[132:51.67]More than the fire.
[132:52.25]I need lightning damage increase.
[133:03.84]That's pretty good.
[133:05.74]That's pretty good too.
[133:14.70]I'll go with ice.
[133:31.69]They're closing in!
[133:52.27]I'm surrounded.
[134:11.06]Shoot someone!
[134:29.32]Dark arts.
[134:31.26]Dark arts.
[134:35.31]Arby's, we have the meat.
[134:37.75]Frostbite.
[134:58.88]Jesus, it's that.
[135:01.60]Or it's curse.
[135:02.52]It's curse.
[135:28.54]Oh, it's that one.
[135:46.52]Why there's so many things?
[135:47.78]Oh, it's because I did that hard mode.
[135:59.20]Is that ore?
[136:04.00]I need more reload.
[136:05.16]Bad.
[136:05.76]It's a gyre.
[136:26.37]When you inflict freeze, also inflict burn.
[136:29.49]Whoa.
[136:31.67]Um.
[136:33.47]Let's go.
[136:33.83]Yo, the new Arby's disgusting chicken sandwich.
[136:46.88]I feel bad.
[136:47.60]Okay, I feel kind of bad.
[136:49.48]Because, like, I think Arby's is a fucking awful place.
[136:53.19]But, I mean, is it alright?
[136:54.55]I don't know.
[136:58.48]Is that, like, mean, what I'm saying?
[137:09.82]Oh, shit!
[137:11.52]Oh, no!
[137:11.74]I don't wanna go to the army!
[137:54.87]Why am I reloading so- I have auto-reload on.
[138:00.03]Every 10 enemies killed by Curse won't increase your bullet damage by 1% permanently? ...
[138:41.84]This one.
[139:00.25]Should I bump somebody?
[139:00.99]I didn't even see them.
[139:34.52]I'm okay.
[140:11.92]Where's the boss?
[140:13.02]Where'd the boss die?
[140:14.83]Where's the boss?
[141:16.46]It's probably this.
[141:17.22]Watch out for the tree.
[141:44.64]My god, that's so good.
[141:46.50]Come on.
[141:46.86]Oh
[142:22.99]Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, I think so.
[143:08.48]Glare?
[143:08.88]I think it's glare.
[143:16.62]Glare, let's go.
[143:56.85]HOLY SHIT!
[144:56.17]Thanks for watching!
[145:56.96]10% fire rate every time she inflicts burn?
[145:59.32]Oh ho ho ho ho!
[146:05.57]Knock back!
[146:07.23]Knock back, knock back, knock back, knock back, knock back.
[146:27.77]I don't have to eat at Arby's.
[146:38.93]Well, hold on.
[146:39.75]Don't get cocky.
[146:41.03]I could dive really quickly here.
[146:50.00]Fire rate, bullet damage, reload rate, ammo piercing.
[146:52.54]Yep.
[146:57.10]It's over.
[146:57.74]It's literally over.
[146:58.68]It's over.
[146:59.20]I killed a tree.
[147:32.71]This is just absolutely stupid what's going on right now.
[147:35.64]Look at how... That was stupid.
[147:37.78]Look at how fast this is... Look at the spire rate.
[147:40.74]The game is broken.
[147:54.05]That...
[148:15.08]This whole bed is so stupid.
[148:31.44]Might hit level 40, I might.
[148:49.18]38.
[148:52.38]Wait, I'll do this.
[148:53.65]Just stand still.
[148:54.31]Firework.
[149:28.42]Holy shit, don't be stupid.
[149:29.44]I don't think I'm not going to hit 40, but still cool.
[150:02.72]I did it.
[150:08.49]Sorry, Arby's fans.
[150:10.79]Not tonight.
[150:18.60]Eating an Arby's gyro.
[150:21.96]That's such a huge punishment.
[150:23.60]Wouldn't you feel bad if you were Arby's?
[150:27.28]I don't want to lose a bet and eat an Arby's gyro.
[150:33.93]Double or nothing?
[150:34.81]What, I have to eat two Arby's Gyros or?
[150:37.86]No, there's no double or nothing.
[150:39.30]That's it.
[150:39.76]Your eyes are deep fried.
[150:43.24]They are.
[150:43.56]I think they're OK.
[150:51.74]Maybe not.
[150:57.44]Maybe they're a little weird.
[151:01.27]It was worth it.
[151:03.03]And that's where I'm going to end the stream.
[151:05.73]I think that's a solid place to go out on.
[151:07.01]I will buy some stuff, though.
[151:08.87]This game is absolutely fantastic.
[151:10.95]What a great game this is.
[151:14.65]This is really good.
[151:15.81]Very good.
[151:18.36]I gotta say, this is wonderful.
[151:20.12]This is a great game.
[151:24.52]Alright, I just want to test these.
[151:48.09]I like this.
[151:54.99]Start the game with your HP at half of your max HP.
[151:59.13]Bullet damage and fire rate 5% per rank.
[152:01.23]That kind of feels kind of bad.
[152:09.84]I'm going to unlock all the weapons.
[152:14.32]Bat gun.
[152:15.40]Grenade launcher.
[152:17.87]Magic bow.
[152:20.17]Alright, I just want to try the... SMGs.
[152:29.38]That's kind of cool.
[152:29.82]Alright, I'm going to try Spark with the dual SMGs.
[152:32.76]I just want to try.
[152:33.98]I just want to try.
[152:36.92]Play for 10 seconds.
[152:43.39]Yeah, it's pretty damn good.
[152:48.75]This is great.
[152:49.45]Okay, cool.
[152:49.93]What a great game.
[152:52.31]Synergies.
[152:53.13]Oh.
[152:55.04]That was helpful.
[152:56.10]Alright.
[152:58.92]I'll see you guys later.
[152:59.74]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[153:00.66]Wednesday we're going to play Sorcery Part 3.
[153:03.06]Going back to it.
[153:05.29]Should be a nice, chill stream.
[153:08.17]Thanks for watching today.
[153:09.13]The games were fun.
[153:10.65]Had a good time, as always.
[153:13.60]And I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[153:14.96]And then again, I'll be on Name Your Price on Austin Show's Name Your Price this Thursday.
[153:19.89]I think I earned a Happy Meal.
[153:33.08]Yeah, thanks for watching.
[153:33.80]Thanks for the support.
[153:38.32]Take care of yourselves.
[153:44.67]Hopefully we see you soon.
[153:45.79]This has to be five Happy Meals.
[153:55.78]If I had lost that round, I would have been like, alright, see you guys later.
[153:59.98]Yeah, I'll tweet out the Arby's.
[154:01.38]I would have turned the stream off.
[154:03.19]I would have went and talked to Holly.
[154:05.89]I would have closed the door and been like, how do we fake me eating Arby's because I really don't want it.
[154:16.57]But I would have to prove it.
[154:17.41]I would have to take a bite on camera and prove it to you, right?
[154:20.93]Oh, God.
[154:32.85]Somebody got a McDonald's ad.
[154:33.99]Really?
[154:35.28]Well...
[154:44.17]You're making it sound so much worse than it is.
[154:46.07]I know it's not that bad.
[154:49.90]But I actually genuinely don't like Arby's at all.
[154:57.38]It is probably one of my least favorite fast food places.
[155:05.74]Have you ever eaten it?
[155:06.38]Yes, I've had it twice.
[155:07.24]And both times I said I do not really like this.
[155:22.53]You're making it sound like you're forced to eat prison slop.
[155:31.49]The new Arby's prison slop sandwich.
[155:35.00]Full of meat, cheese, and onions.
[155:40.16]Authentic to the real thing.
[155:49.23]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[155:50.03]See you guys Wednesday.
[155:51.39]Starting at... Let's see, what time should I start on Wednesday?
[155:55.78]We're probably going to start early on Wednesday.
[155:57.20]Probably somewhere between 12 and 1.
[156:03.98]We'll probably start somewhere around 12.31 on Wednesday.
[156:07.23]Pacific.
[156:12.71]Good night, though.
[156:13.11]We'll see you soon.
[156:14.91]Take it easy.
[156:17.68]Goodbye.
[156:27.14]you
[157:05.63]Yes.
[157:06.61]Yes, call your mother.
[157:07.47]Of course.
[157:08.78]It's implied.
[157:12.50]Say it again.
