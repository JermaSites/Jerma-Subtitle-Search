[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.01]I have no idea what happened.
[00:03.21]I told like to reverse countdown.
[00:04.63]And my fucking stream just turned on.
[00:09.07]So that's a new feature.
[00:10.09]Okay, I'll see you later.
[00:20.48]I guess I have to do something.
[00:21.38]I don't know, I wasn't planning on streaming for like another four hours.
[00:23.14]Alright, yep.
[00:27.40]hey what's happening everybody welcome to the stream uh we're starting this is when I this is what I'm starting streaming orbit soon alright uh actually give me one second I need to move a few windows see in a minute or two
[01:52.95]Alright.
[01:54.71]So today, we're doing something.
[01:57.94]Kind of just came out of the blue.
[02:00.16]For no reason, last week.
[02:03.04]Just decided that this is what we're going to do today.
[02:05.40]And probably tomorrow too.
[02:07.36]Depends on how much fun everybody thinks this is.
[02:09.25]I think it's going to be fun.
[02:13.83]We're going to do Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[02:17.17]I know it's kind of odd.
[02:18.85]Why are you playing this right now?
[02:22.27]Well, it just kind of came up.
[02:23.47]I remembered how much I loved this game.
[02:26.39]And we're going to play it.
[02:28.43]This is going to be a real comfortable stream.
[02:30.09]Now I'm going to be passing out blankets and eye masks over the course of this stream flight.
[02:40.31]Feel free.
[02:42.57]By the way, they're all $6.
[02:45.98]So, I mean, I'm not going to be passing them out.
[02:48.12]I mean, you're going to be paying for them as I walk by the aisle.
[02:58.75]Don't make any loud noises.
[03:01.81]No, you can't make a loud noise on any transportation.
[03:04.79]Don't make any loud noises.
[03:07.61]And... Just watch the screen.
[03:11.64]We will be arriving in... Amsterdam in about 12 hours.
[03:20.46]So... Have a good trip here.
[03:24.00]Stream trip.
[03:27.42]Why are we going to Amsterdam?
[03:31.47]It was the first... It was the first, like, city and, like, European place I could think of in the 10 seconds I was reaching for one.
[03:40.25]But, yeah, we're gonna play... This is a classic game.
[03:42.07]A lot of people are gonna be confused when we first play because there's a lot going on in the game.
[03:46.87]And I even don't know a shitload of the stuff that's going on in this game.
[03:51.50]I loved this game when I was a kid.
[03:53.98]When I was a teenager.
[03:55.68]And I didn't even fucking understand any of the nuances and the complex systems that could potentially be in the game.
[04:01.68]I just clicked on stuff and I had fun.
[04:03.84]And I have a basic understanding and I haven't played in a long time.
[04:07.05]So we're going in with like 14 year old brain into 34 year old body.
[04:15.17]And then teleport to 2019.
[04:18.87]So, why don't we just show it on the screen so you can see what it looks like.
[04:20.90]There it is, Heroes of Might and Magic.
[04:22.30]Let's get the music turned on.
[04:23.50]It's a pretty good soundtrack.
[04:25.22]One, two, three.
[04:32.29]He's Mr. Worldwide over here.
[04:36.41]No, you're getting loud.
[04:37.01]You're getting loud.
[04:37.51]Just quiet down.
[04:39.17]There's no dancing in the aisles either.
[04:42.03]I'm seeing dancing, please.
[04:43.72]You're not dancing.
[04:44.58]Sit down in your seats.
[04:46.90]Shh, stop.
[04:51.22]Okay.
[04:54.58]What a fucking dumb plane that would be.
[04:58.97]And you're, like, just on a plane, like a nine-hour plane, and you're just sitting in your seat, like, with your iPad, and people are just fucking dancing.
[05:07.45]You'd just be like, sit down!
[05:09.04]Alright, here we go.
[05:16.25]I think there's a campaign in the game, but I don't know if I want to do it.
[05:20.66]I feel like I'd rather do one of the random scenarios because I've never clicked this button.
[05:28.60]I've played this game dozens and dozens of times over years.
[05:32.52]I've never selected this button.
[05:39.45]I think we can keep it that way.
[05:40.43]So this is a random scenario.
[05:45.68]This is all for one.
[05:46.60]Let's see available scenarios.
[05:48.30]Because you can do random map, you can do random scenarios.
[05:53.81]And they all are different completely.
[05:55.97]You can have up to like eight people in a game.
[05:58.71]There's no multiplayer on this one, unfortunately, because it is the old version.
[06:07.41]Rush to capital.
[06:13.30]I want to play.
[06:14.26]I want to play.
[06:15.40]Let us in.
[06:16.08]You can't... What do you mean, let us in?
[06:19.66]Look, this is not the pirated version.
[06:21.16]I bought this from good old games.
[06:23.91]Don't pirate this.
[06:25.25]Buy it.
[06:26.21]It's good.
[06:26.61]It's worth your $10.
[06:27.37]I don't think we can smart click this.
[06:30.51]Let's just find an interesting one.
[06:31.55]This is Warlords.
[06:33.09]I'll read them for you.
[06:33.83]Alright, here we go.
[06:36.27]I'm going to read... How many are there?
[06:38.23]I'm not going to read them all.
[06:39.09]That's too many.
[06:39.97]Let's find one that I think is cool, and then I'll read it out loud.
[06:44.64]Let us click.
[06:46.84]The bubble won't even be here.
[06:50.87]If you click here, you're gonna click here and here and here.
[06:54.07]No, I'm clicking on it.
[06:56.19]A brave new world.
[06:58.93]A great upheaval shook the very foundations of the world, breaking apart continents and dividing territories in new ways.
[07:05.33]After the Earth stood still once more, the people crawled out from their hiding places and began to rebuild in this brave new world.
[07:12.94]No one's clicking.
[07:13.58]Sit down in your seats.
[07:15.92]Yada, yada, yada.
[07:20.74]No one's clicking on my screen, okay?
[07:23.10]No one's clicking once.
[07:24.90]And we need to do map size.
[07:26.12]Let's do, like, medium.
[07:28.24]This is the first... Okay, this is the first scenario.
[07:31.23]I just need to show you guys how to play.
[07:35.85]Here, like, how about this one?
[07:36.93]Like, Deluge.
[07:41.81]I need to get back into the swing of things.
[07:47.29]Pick elbow.
[07:48.95]Alright, I could do that.
[07:50.49]This world ain't big enough.
[07:51.35]No, no, no.
[07:51.61]This is going to be too hard.
[07:52.47]Alright, here we go.
[07:54.64]I'm just going to do random scenario.
[07:55.70]Here we go.
[07:57.30]I'm going for it.
[07:58.59]Let's go for... I don't know.
[08:00.79]Let's roll the dice.
[08:03.37]Here we go.
[08:04.05]One, two, three.
[08:05.37]Starting here.
[08:07.25]Just a visit.
[08:08.37]Emerald Isles.
[08:09.11]Step by step.
[08:10.43]Harsh winter.
[08:11.63]Rumble in the bogs.
[08:12.99]Carpe diem.
[08:13.51]Seize the day.
[08:14.77]A few years back, the gods decided they no longer wanted any part in this world.
[08:17.48]Now there is total anarchy.
[08:18.78]Everybody blames everyone else for the gods of manning them.
[08:21.30]While sitting in the throne room, you decided you were the only person fit to rule.
[08:25.52]Carpe diem.
[08:29.33]Here we go.
[08:32.13]Lose... Defeat everybody.
[08:33.69]Kill everybody.
[08:34.19]And we got player difficulty is on 160%.
[08:40.57]I don't want that.
[08:42.13]I just want it on like 100% or just right in the middle.
[08:45.61]What does this mean?
[08:46.31]I don't know what that means.
[08:48.40]I know what that means.
[08:49.30]I don't know what this one means.
[08:51.60]I'm not going all the way up here. 130.
[08:59.38]Rumble.
[09:00.04]Rumble in the bogs.
[09:03.56]It's difficulty scaling, so this should just be right in the middle.
[09:11.10]130, I'll take it.
[09:11.72]I'm not gonna max it.
[09:13.58]Not for the first one.
[09:14.30]Alright, here we go.
[09:14.76]Ready?
[09:16.00]What about advanced options?
[09:17.02]Ah, shit.
[09:17.70]Hold on.
[09:18.80]Starting town.
[09:19.52]Oh, this is important.
[09:20.24]This is important.
[09:20.62]This is me.
[09:21.98]I need to pick my flag.
[09:25.48]Which flag do I want to be?
[09:26.22]Do I want to be red?
[09:26.96]Blue?
[09:28.16]Um...
[09:30.00]sand green orange or purple green alright starting town uh we can pick starting towns here I think we should just do should we just do what do you think who should I be who should I start as should I be oh here we go okay that's all I needed to see alright uh
[10:02.15]Where do I want to go?
[10:03.69]Town alignment, castle, associated creatures, pikemen, archer, griffin, the swordsman, the monk, the cavalier, and the angel.
[10:11.59]Okay, so this is kind of standard fantasy knights and archers and griffins.
[10:18.17]This one is more fantasy creatures, like dwarves and elves and centaurs and unicorns.
[10:24.88]This is the tower.
[10:25.76]So this is like fantasy-styled creatures.
[10:28.42]Gremlin, Gargoyle, Gollum, Mage, Genie.
[10:32.82]I think I want this one.
[10:34.50]Inferno is a little geared more towards high fantasy, so you have Imp, Gog, Hellhound, Demon...
[10:42.69]Hmm.
[10:43.89]Pit Fiend, that's kind of cool.
[10:46.12]Necropolis.
[10:50.42]I don't have any other way to describe anything.
[10:53.96]Um, this is a... I don't know.
[11:00.98]I like this one, though.
[11:01.76]Skeletons, Lich, Black Knight, Bone Dragon.
[11:05.78]Harpy Beholder.
[11:07.80]Medusa.
[11:09.82]Goblin.
[11:10.36]These, like, orcs...
[11:13.84]Null, Lizard Van, Serpent Fly, Firebird, Elementals.
[11:19.28]Alright, I think I'm gonna go with the Gremlins.
[11:24.08]I think so.
[11:26.18]The Tower.
[11:27.72]We get Gremlins, we get Stone Golems, we get Mages.
[11:32.90]Oh, shit, I need a new... Hmm... I like this one.
[11:42.11]That's just the... You took a photo of me, and I'm not photogenic, and I wasn't ready for it.
[11:46.77]And that's how I look in every picture.
[11:49.89]Torosar.
[11:50.47]We need a better name.
[11:52.03]Can we rename?
[11:52.75]I don't think we can rename.
[11:57.54]Torosar.
[11:59.86]I think that's good.
[12:06.58]Everybody else can be random, that's fine.
[12:09.22]We don't need to do any of this.
[12:13.52]That's where we're gonna start, everyone else's computer, and we're on normal difficulty.
[12:18.50]Three, two, one.
[12:24.87]It is your belief that the gods didn't abandon their people.
[12:28.23]But the people have abandoned their gods.
[12:30.32]To bring the gods back, you must make the people believe in the gods again.
[12:35.42]By force, if necessary.
[12:38.94]Here is your castle.
[12:39.78]This is where you stand.
[12:40.82]This is your stronghold.
[12:42.84]Here's the map.
[12:44.28]It goes eons and eons and light years away from you.
[12:49.04]You step outside of the castle, and you see... I'm not going to narrate this whole thing.
[12:53.77]So, Heroes of Might and Magic, if you want to know how this works, do not be deceived by this initial overworld map.
[13:00.51]It's a click game, and you click around, and you... Oh, look at that.
[13:03.29]That was fun.
[13:04.08]No, no, there's way more than that.
[13:05.32]There's a whole full combat system.
[13:07.32]2D and potentially 3D.
[13:09.62]This is isometric 3D.
[13:13.07]The game works based around exploring and getting stronger and leveling up and leveling up your creatures and having thousands of them and having them fight.
[13:20.79]I hope you're ready for the best fucking game you will ever see.
[13:25.79]Ever in your entire life.
[13:29.72]On this channel.
[13:30.42]Here we go.
[13:32.44]So, let's go look at the castle.
[13:34.70]This is where we are right now.
[13:36.08]This is who we have.
[13:36.76]We have the fucking random... I, like, hate this guy already.
[13:43.63]So, we have 31 gremlins.
[13:48.19]They're like jesters.
[13:49.56]Okay.
[13:52.62]They, uh... 31 of them.
[13:53.22]We've got 3 stone golems.
[13:55.88]There are 16 available gremlins right now.
[13:58.84]That's too many gremlins to have?
[13:59.98]No, I want, like, 500 of them.
[14:04.10]Not playing as the skeletons.
[14:05.80]Dropped.
[14:06.40]But this is the first scenario.
[14:07.44]We can play more scenarios.
[14:08.58]I'm excited.
[14:10.79]Emotions are overwhelming me right now.
[14:13.53]So, how this works is these are all the monsters we can eventually make.
[14:19.22]Eventually we can have this giant guy with a lightsaber.
[14:21.76]It's awesome.
[14:23.50]The genies.
[14:24.08]The mages.
[14:26.45]Stone gargoyles, this is a lot of cool things.
[14:29.02]And these are the most, obviously, most powerful units you can make.
[14:31.62]But, for the purposes of what's happening here, this is your tree.
[14:34.56]Yep, oh, there's a tree.
[14:37.02]All of these have a function, and they all cost a certain amount of resources.
[14:41.94]So, for instance, the blacksmith.
[14:44.06]Uh, the blacksmith provides your armies with ammo carts.
[14:47.18]Okay, well that's a thousand gold and five wood.
[14:49.74]I got fifteen wood.
[14:51.16]You get resources by claiming territory.
[14:56.77]or by trading it, or by finding it.
[14:59.63]Okay?
[15:00.65]Are we understanding here?
[15:02.51]You can upgrade your tower.
[15:04.01]You can upgrade your buildings and bases many, many times.
[15:09.58]This is a cool mobile ad stream.
[15:11.96]Now, I'm just taking it slow because people are going to have a lot of questions.
[15:15.40]Okay?
[15:16.86]Let's do it very... Okay, Golem Factory.
[15:19.62]The Golem Factory allows you to recruit stone golems.
[15:23.19]It's five wood, five hairballs, and $2,000.
[15:28.80]I'm gonna get that because I want to be able to start having goblins.
[15:31.96]Golems.
[15:34.18]Here we go.
[15:35.74]There it is right there.
[15:37.74]Six of these are recruited a week.
[15:42.47]I can buy six per week.
[15:44.81]It's 900 bucks.
[15:51.70]As you see.
[15:53.22]I'm gonna buy them.
[15:54.42]I'm gonna recruit them right now.
[15:56.14]Here we go.
[15:56.69]See?
[15:56.87]Add them.
[15:59.03]Now I get nine.
[16:00.93]If you don't leave anything here, your castle can be claimed by other people.
[16:06.71]So if I don't have, for instance, if I can put... Like, oh, let's put... You can split them up too.
[16:12.57]So I'm going to leave... I'll leave like two... I'll leave two of these guys here.
[16:19.04]Now they're going to get wiped out of the castle if it's ever breached.
[16:21.64]But who cares, right?
[16:22.42]I don't need anybody defending the castle right now.
[16:24.75]I'm going to just take everybody.
[16:29.27]But this is where you do most of your maintenance.
[16:31.39]Now you probably- Oh, that was fucking awesome, Jeremy.
[16:34.21]Like, holy shit, that was the fucking coolest thing you've ever shown us.
[16:37.53]I know.
[16:38.42]So here we go, ready?
[16:40.06]You go by, uh, you can only go a certain amount of paces per turn.
[16:45.80]Right, so here's how far I can move.
[16:49.09]See?
[16:49.21]See?
[16:50.49]Every single one of these things is interactable, and they have consequences, they have choices.
[16:55.17]There are a pack of wood elves here, and there's something behind them.
[16:58.49]A monolith one-way entrance.
[16:59.97]I don't even know what the fuck that is.
[17:01.58]I have no idea what that is.
[17:03.18]I wish I could tell you what that was.
[17:05.42]I don't know if I'm... A pack of wood elves, would I be able to kill them?
[17:08.12]I don't know.
[17:09.48]Maybe I'll try!
[17:11.36]First of all, let's pick up this, uh, this treasure chest.
[17:14.20]Ooh!
[17:14.72]Ooh!
[17:17.09]After scouring the area, you fall upon a hidden treasure chest.
[17:20.01]You may take the gold or distribute it to the peasants for experience.
[17:22.75]Which do you choose?
[17:23.41]This is important because you can take money and be able to buy things, or you can take experience, which levels up your hero, which then lets you put skill points in, which lets you do more better things.
[17:36.45]I think... I'm going to do experience.
[17:39.75]You have to pick this every time.
[17:42.93]Let's pick experience.
[17:45.63]Bingo!
[17:46.47]Taurosar is now a level 2 alchemist.
[17:48.59]Spell power plus 1.
[17:52.73]Or... Well, no, you can pick one of these two.
[17:55.31]You can pick either advanced tactics or basic ballistics.
[18:01.25]I don't know what those are!
[18:03.28]Just sit down.
[18:04.90]Advanced tactics allow you to rearrange your troops just before combat within five hex rows of the commanding hero.
[18:11.99]Fuck, man, that sounds pretty good.
[18:13.31]Basic Ballistics.
[18:14.83]Gives control of the catapult to the hero.
[18:17.26]Allowing aim shots with increased damage.
[18:19.74]That's if you're breaching buildings.
[18:21.22]If you're breaching towers.
[18:23.22]I don't know.
[18:23.62]They both sound pretty good.
[18:25.38]I would probably say Basic Ballistics.
[18:26.64]Because that's how you really take over castles very well.
[18:33.59]You sound so excited.
[18:34.35]I love this game.
[18:35.01]This is like one of my favorite things ever.
[18:38.21]This is what a sponsored stream would sound like.
[18:41.68]But this is like a, I'm sponsoring this game.
[18:44.62]You know what I mean?
[18:45.24]I'm sponsoring this stream.
[18:46.42]It's me.
[18:46.72]I'm going to do ballistics.
[18:50.57]You know what I'm saying?
[18:51.29]This is me sponsoring this game.
[18:54.51]They're not sponsoring me.
[18:55.51]I'm sponsoring them.
[18:56.45]I bought this game for $10 and I'm telling you to play it.
[19:01.67]Alright, so we've got a scholar here.
[19:02.79]Ooh, I don't know what to do.
[19:04.29]Because I only get a certain amount of things I can do per turn.
[19:06.33]Remember, this is very important, everybody.
[19:08.49]Listen to me and stop talking during class.
[19:11.78]Oh, Dave, back there.
[19:14.70]We don't, there's no food allowed in the classroom.
[19:17.38]And Karen.
[19:19.16]Karen, you like to pass notes, huh?
[19:20.46]Is that what you're doing?
[19:22.18]Oh, let's see.
[19:22.56]Let me see that.
[19:24.38]Let me see that.
[19:25.62]Thank you.
[19:27.59]What's it say?
[19:33.81]Oh, the teacher's ass is fucking huge.
[19:35.59]I wonder how he fits at his desk.
[19:38.71]He probably desperately needs two seats for one for each ass cheek.
[19:44.09]Fucking funny.
[19:46.03]Sit down.
[19:47.57]Every single one of you is coming after school for detention.
[19:52.71]But you didn't do anything?
[19:55.35]Doesn't matter.
[19:56.39]You all have to think about what you've done.
[20:00.31]Unbelievable.
[20:01.09]Okay, so let's go to the windmill.
[20:02.92]You ready?
[20:03.58]You ready?
[20:08.60]The windmill had five.
[20:12.66]Whatever that is.
[20:14.40]That's all that was there.
[20:16.30]Sometimes it can be something bad.
[20:17.38]Sometimes it can be a scenario.
[20:18.72]Alright, should I talk to the scholar?
[20:21.50]As you ride into a clearing, you notice a university scholar arresting his horse.
[20:25.40]He agrees to teach you some of what he knows before setting off.
[20:28.51]Basic fire magic.
[20:34.91]I think we just got easy mode right here.
[20:36.21]Basic... Can I learn that, though?
[20:37.47]Okay, so what do I... Let me see.
[20:40.29]Basic fire magic.
[20:42.30]Cast fire spells at a reduced cost.
[20:44.76]Ooh.
[20:45.84]But I don't know any spells, though.
[20:50.32]This is always my spell book.
[20:52.95]I don't think I have any spells.
[20:55.20]Where's the spell book?
[20:55.86]I know it's like a certain button you press.
[21:03.95]I don't remember.
[21:04.53]I'll figure it out.
[21:05.51]Anyways, okay, here's some wood.
[21:06.81]That was six wood.
[21:08.93]These don't respawn, by the way.
[21:11.03]There's seven crystals.
[21:15.04]Do you think I'm prepared to do this?
[21:16.02]What if I just lose?
[21:16.66]I'm out of time.
[21:19.72]My turn is over.
[21:21.00]So as you can see, I can't go anywhere else.
[21:23.30]The only way it would be possible for me to do anything else is if I had another hero, which you can recruit.
[21:27.39]They cost money.
[21:31.73]By the way, that windmill sound is a page-turning sound effect.
[21:37.66]That has been looped over and over again.
[21:40.02]Pretty interesting.
[21:41.72]Alright, so.
[21:43.10]I can go to the kingdom.
[21:43.86]We can see the whole world.
[21:44.56]We don't really do much of that right now.
[21:45.72]I can end my turn.
[21:46.50]That's all I can do.
[21:47.26]I'm done.
[21:48.50]End turn.
[21:49.94]Right.
[21:50.66]Ooh.
[21:51.44]Okay.
[21:53.22]It's our turn again.
[21:54.52]Everybody else has moved.
[21:56.04]Everybody else has done something.
[21:58.81]Let's go to the Shrine of Magic Thought.
[22:05.19]Landmine.
[22:07.73]What does that mean, landmine?
[22:10.79]What if I just exploded?
[22:14.25]I feel like I want to try to fight this guy.
[22:15.93]Who do I have in mind?
[22:16.87]No, I've got plenty of people.
[22:17.69]Let's see if I can do it.
[22:19.65]Here we go.
[22:29.01]What?
[22:32.74]Why didn't I get to fight?
[22:34.60]What just happened?
[22:38.69]um what why did that happen that's not supposed to happen that's not I'm okay I'm telling you that's absolutely not supposed to I have auto combat on why would nine golems and 31 goblins lose to six archers even in an auto scenario and torosar is dead is he's abandoned me what
[23:07.78]Okay, what's... Okay, it's... I'm really confused.
[23:12.71]In the ta... Yeah, I... Okay, the... I need to... I need to, like, go into settings and turn that off?
[23:20.34]Okay.
[23:21.62]That's part of the HD mod.
[23:23.54]This is... I don't have the HD mod.
[23:24.98]This is just from good old games.
[23:28.48]Alright, but anyways, more importantly, the hero with a higher tactic skill can arrange their armies before any combat begins.
[23:36.81]So, before combat begins, I can move, as you see, I've got these slots here.
[23:42.92]I'm going to try to get behind this, because that can give me line of sight.
[23:46.94]I don't have any ranged, so I might just be fucked anyways.
[23:51.31]We're just going to move forward.
[23:53.27]And it's now my turn.
[23:55.85]They don't have any active spells.
[23:57.42]Their morale is whatever.
[23:58.76]Fuck them.
[23:59.88]Damage 3 to 5.
[24:02.12]As long as I can get... I might actually lose here.
[24:05.62]I actually might lose here.
[24:06.50]Alright, that looks fine.
[24:08.46]Shit.
[24:08.60]This is bad.
[24:13.23]This is going to be bad.
[24:13.93]I'm going to lose.
[24:16.23]I'm fucked.
[24:16.73]I just wanted to show you what combat looked like.
[24:24.94]I might be able to do it.
[24:26.38]It's possible.
[24:27.92]What about, do I have any spells?
[24:29.26]Magic arrow!
[24:34.52]He can't, I can't do it.
[24:35.36]Yeah, I can.
[24:37.60]Here we go.
[24:41.51]Alright, I killed two of them.
[24:45.03]I'm gonna go for it.
[24:45.77]They're gonna kill these.
[24:46.57]This is bad.
[24:50.09]I'm going right down to the bottom here.
[24:53.93]Come on, no!
[24:55.53]He's dead.
[24:55.87]I gotta do it again.
[25:01.47]The hero might be able to do this.
[25:06.66]It's very possible.
[25:08.95]Come on.
[25:09.79]Here we go.
[25:10.17]Alright.
[25:10.93]So, once you get to this point where I can actually get close enough to attack, you can get in there and choose any angle that you really want to from whatever hex you want to do.
[25:19.18]I'm going to do from here.
[25:25.08]Sometimes they can retaliate.
[25:28.14]And when they retaliate, it does a certain amount of percentage of damage.
[25:32.09]We're going to go right here.
[25:37.22]He's trying to run away.
[25:37.90]That's fine.
[25:38.46]We'll get under here.
[25:39.00]These guys are stronger, remember.
[25:41.40]I'm gonna slow this down.
[25:47.89]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[25:48.35]Hold on.
[25:49.01]Yeah, alright, alright.
[25:50.45]Slow down the animations.
[25:51.51]It was going, like, really fast.
[25:56.11]Come on, stay alive.
[25:57.61]I don't want to use any spells.
[25:59.18]I have to.
[26:04.64]Alright, take him out.
[26:06.88]Then get yourself over here.
[26:10.25]He's alive.
[26:11.07]Very good.
[26:12.71]And that's a victory.
[26:21.52]A glorious victory.
[26:22.42]For Valor in combat, Torus R receives 250 experience.
[26:26.62]And here are your attackers and here are your defenders.
[26:29.05]16 archers.
[26:30.81]We lost almost every single person.
[26:34.57]But!
[26:36.89]Did we?
[26:37.45]We're still alright.
[26:39.23]Remember, every week you get more.
[26:41.51]They're back at the town.
[26:44.75]See?
[26:44.95]Ready?
[26:47.31]They're currently... How do I get a good view of that?
[26:51.86]View towns.
[26:52.76]Okay, this is my only town that I have.
[26:55.77]I think I actually have to physically go in here to see it, don't I?
[27:00.27]Can't I just go look?
[27:03.93]Kingdom overview.
[27:06.14]Okay, see, creatures available.
[27:07.54]I can go get 16 gremlins.
[27:13.95]But I need to get... Okay, this is gold.
[27:15.71]Let's get it.
[27:16.77]That was a thousand gold.
[27:18.42]Pretty cool.
[27:19.52]I don't know what this is.
[27:20.26]I'm kind of scared to click it because I have... I have four... I have four golems.
[27:25.46]And if there's like a monster in there, I'm dead.
[27:32.50]Here we go.
[27:32.86]Okay.
[27:33.50]So you don't have to be... Your hero doesn't have to go in.
[27:36.22]Here's our town.
[27:38.26]This is who's available to recruit.
[27:42.50]There's none here, because it's by week.
[27:46.58]You can actually recruit all available creatures.
[27:50.61]Now let's see what we've got.
[27:51.27]Tavern.
[27:52.99]I can get another hero, but I don't think I want to do that, because I don't want to spread myself out.
[27:58.47]Arch Magi throw magic with a precision greater than most archers.
[28:02.25]So we have a Wizard and Necromancer that are available to hire.
[28:07.29]We can get Astral or Nimbus.
[28:10.53]And that is a Necromancer.
[28:12.56]Get the Necromancer, but I'm not going to take the Necromancer out.
[28:16.00]I don't want to get too many heroes.
[28:18.90]That's 2,500 bucks!
[28:20.71]Alright, fine.
[28:22.77]We don't want to... Remember, money is important.
[28:25.45]I just bumped the mic, I know.
[28:27.11]So, we have Skeletons and Walking Dead.
[28:30.55]That's what he starts with.
[28:32.59]And we may as well just... That's a lot of money, but recruit, and we're going to stack this guy.
[28:40.95]So he's got three different creatures.
[28:44.51]I don't think any of these are ranged.
[28:48.64]And now, as you see, here's the window.
[28:50.38]I have two different options to where I want to go.
[28:53.66]I might just throw this guy away.
[28:54.82]Let's just go in the portal.
[28:55.80]Alright, where'd I end up?
[28:58.48]Over here?
[29:00.56]Alright.
[29:05.10]This is somebody's kingdom.
[29:08.97]This just took me right to the front door of somebody's house.
[29:12.89]Should I go in?
[29:13.40]Is there anybody in there?
[29:14.68]There's nobody even here!
[29:15.48]There's like two frogs guarding this place.
[29:20.12]I'm taking this one.
[29:24.70]I'm out of turns.
[29:26.03]Alright, there's like literally one frog here.
[29:30.85]Let's go through here.
[29:31.79]I'm gonna go this way with this guy.
[29:34.57]Because there's a pack of hobgoblins...
[29:38.64]Let's get the ore.
[29:41.53]Let's get some gems.
[29:43.93]Another scenario where I can do... Let's level them up.
[29:47.53]Didn't level up?
[29:48.07]Okay, that's fine.
[29:49.36]Warrior's tomb not visited.
[29:51.00]Go in there.
[29:51.46]Okay.
[29:56.50]You have come upon the resting place of a nameless warrior.
[29:58.77]Do you wish to search the tomb?
[30:04.50]Don't do it.
[30:05.88]Don't.
[30:07.39]Should I go in there?
[30:08.17]What if there's, like, gold in there?
[30:10.99]I don't have, but my, I don't have my creatures, like, I, I... Let's go for it.
[30:16.43]Reluctantly, your troops enter the tomb, finding the vial of lifeblood.
[30:21.06]But such a despicable act has ruined your army's morale.
[30:26.84]Oh, damn.
[30:28.14]This item increases the health of all your units by +2.
[30:35.40]Holy shit.
[30:37.95]That's pretty great, actually.
[30:40.75]Everyone has plus 2 health.
[30:44.37]So, you mean, oh wait, 16 plus 2, what do you mean?
[30:47.19]No, so, those of you that are still maybe a little confused, if you're not, then, you know, that's fine, but for the people that don't get it.
[30:52.53]So there are 16 gremlins in the, here.
[30:55.85]It looks like 1 on the screen, but it's 16.
[30:58.43]So that means 16 times 6, instead of 16 times 4.
[31:09.13]See?
[31:09.85]6.
[31:11.11]At 15 health.
[31:16.83]Everything, each, all of them.
[31:17.79]You know what I'm saying?
[31:20.03]Just want to get you aware of what's happening, you know?
[31:22.07]Just so you can see.
[31:22.55]Alright, well, that was a good... That was a pretty good outcome.
[31:25.43]Let's keep going.
[31:25.97]I'm out of time, I think.
[31:27.49]Let's end the turn.
[31:28.23]Alright.
[31:30.99]Do you think I can do this?
[31:38.14]Should I just...
[31:40.48]I don't think I can kill this one frog.
[31:44.39]Frog didn't build.
[31:45.49]I gotta go in and turn that off.
[32:07.14]I don't want to see the outcome.
[32:09.44]Um, so.
[32:12.09]There's 13 frogs.
[32:15.57]And I've got, let's move forward a little bit here.
[32:18.91]This, uh, yeah, because this is going to get launched.
[32:22.62]I have, remember the basic military, whatever, basic ballistics?
[32:26.00]This is why you have it.
[32:28.40]Because you want to take down walls.
[32:33.24]I wouldn't be able to do anything if I didn't have this.
[32:35.10]Here come the frogs.
[32:36.03]They're coming out the front door.
[32:36.93]Why are you coming out the front door?
[32:37.93]Alright, back it up.
[32:39.65]Because he'll waste a turn.
[32:48.13]Okay.
[32:49.78]Can I just kill him?
[32:57.48]Alright, these things are really weak.
[33:00.44]I'm probably just going to retaliate and win.
[33:05.38]Uh, I don't think he can do anything.
[33:06.66]I'll just wait.
[33:12.15]Oh, fuck!
[33:12.75]He's trying to kill it!
[33:14.37]Can he destroy that?
[33:27.01]Fucking frogs.
[33:27.99]565 experience.
[33:31.83]Apply battle result.
[33:32.61]Yes.
[33:33.05]There we go.
[33:33.68]Alright.
[33:35.20]Level 3 Alchemist.
[33:37.78]Defense plus 1.
[33:39.44]Everybody in the party gets plus 1.
[33:40.90]And then I can do basic archery or advanced tactics.
[33:45.62]Let's see.
[33:48.16]Basic archery increases the damage done by ranged attacking creatures by 10%.
[33:51.48]I don't have any.
[33:52.80]But it's probably a good idea to get it.
[33:54.30]Because I'll probably eventually have some monsters of archery.
[33:57.44]And now... Here we are.
[34:03.52]I can now recruit... Oh, yeah.
[34:05.78]This is fine now.
[34:10.38]How much do these cost?
[34:12.54]We've got a tavern, town hall, fort.
[34:20.24]I can... Level 1 ranger.
[34:23.00]No, no, I don't want any heroes right now.
[34:26.70]Harpies.
[34:29.20]Alright, how much is it to recruit all these?
[34:30.87]It's a lot of money, but I can deck him out.
[34:34.59]Beholders?
[34:35.05]Are these ranged?
[34:35.59]What do you think, Shot?
[34:38.77]I'm just taking them.
[34:39.43]Let's do it.
[34:42.49]Let's get a nice little army here.
[34:52.42]I mean, the frogs suck, but it's okay.
[34:54.84]Get more frogmen?
[34:56.76]I have to wait till they grow.
[34:59.02]Alright, so I have Evernight and Strong Gale.
[35:05.48]Evernight is the other castle that I own.
[35:06.97]Alright, we're gonna hang out here.
[35:08.87]Let's see, should I buy something?
[35:10.17]What can I upgrade?
[35:12.53]Marketplace Citadel.
[35:14.87]Including a 50% increase to base creature growth, the Citadel adds a keep and other terrain obstacles in a town's defense.
[35:21.08]So I can increase the growth.
[35:23.10]Portal of Summoning.
[35:24.88]You can recruit creatures from an externally flagged dwelling.
[35:33.83]Blacksmith is... you can make... the list is Mushroom Rings.
[35:38.69]The Mushroom Rings increase Frog Lodite production by 7 per week.
[35:43.21]I think we should do that.
[35:44.25]By the way, you can only do one... you can only build once per week.
[35:48.97]So, we're gonna get some more Frog Recruits.
[35:52.48]I can no longer do anything here, but back here, I also... I don't want to bleed my money completely.
[35:56.16]That's the thing, you gotta be careful.
[35:59.86]Citadel...
[36:02.55]Just in case somebody comes.
[36:03.43]I'm going to get the Citadel.
[36:04.37]I'm going to build the Citadel.
[36:07.52]More base creature growth.
[36:11.18]Ah, spells.
[36:12.16]I need spells.
[36:12.70]This is the Spell Tower.
[36:16.30]And then in here, Summon Boat.
[36:20.12]Summons an existing, friendly, unoccupied boat from anywhere in the world to your location.
[36:24.18]Chances for success is 50%.
[36:27.13]Dispel.
[36:27.77]Magic Arrow.
[36:28.65]Slow.
[36:29.81]Okay, so I have to bring somebody in here.
[36:33.78]I have my mage who's currently... Necromancer?
[36:36.80]Does that count?
[36:37.38]Alright, well, I'm... It's a new day.
[36:41.04]Spell points.
[36:41.70]Let's go... Let's bring you in here.
[36:45.60]Actually, you're on the other side of the world.
[36:48.66]Sulphur.
[36:50.58]A little hut.
[36:52.25]Would you like to recruit halflings?
[36:54.51]Fifteen halflings join your army!
[36:58.89]Nice!
[37:02.78]Basically, they like the Shrine of Magic.
[37:05.72]No longer have... Ooh, this crest is up there.
[37:07.48]Alright, let me go... Did I go to this windmill?
[37:13.03]Yeah, I did.
[37:13.39]Visited.
[37:14.85]Learned Landmine.
[37:15.85]Alright, I want to go... What do I want to go?
[37:18.91]Up or down?
[37:23.01]Um, let's go... Up.
[37:24.36]Up.
[37:26.39]Because this is a mine here.
[37:28.29]So if you take a look at this, you see that this scattered stuff, like the scattered ore all over the place.
[37:32.89]This is an actual, like, ore pit.
[37:37.01]Which, when you claim these, you just, it will generate resources.
[37:41.62]So, there's a pack of hobgoblins here.
[37:43.58]Who's in this party?
[37:45.18]Enough?
[37:46.62]Oh, oh, I want to, let me just disable this shit.
[37:48.92]How do I, um, no, no, no, don't quit.
[37:52.42]Where's the menu?
[37:53.42]I just want to get rid of this.
[37:57.18]Get rid of quick combat.
[37:59.50]Okay, yeah, there we go.
[38:02.78]Quick combat disabled.
[38:04.91]So, save the game?
[38:06.99]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[38:07.65]I have to do manual saves.
[38:09.69]Save game.
[38:11.61]Auto save.
[38:12.23]We're just going to name it first map.
[38:21.06]First map saved successfully.
[38:22.34]Here we go.
[38:24.65]Pack of Hobgoblins...
[38:27.01]Here we go.
[38:28.00]They want to fight.
[38:29.16]They can move a lot.
[38:30.22]They can move a very long way.
[38:31.40]Eight.
[38:31.80]And this is... I think I got enough.
[38:34.52]Unfortunately, I don't know if I'm going to be able to... Let me see my spells.
[38:37.98]Shield.
[38:39.08]Shield's a selected unit, reducing the amount of damage received from hand-to-hand attacks.
[38:42.52]I think I'm going to do that to you.
[38:44.24]Because that's where they're going.
[38:48.59]And... I mean, you're not going to be able to move anywhere.
[38:51.25]He's going to make it, so I might as well just move forward.
[38:55.79]Uh, you, on the other hand, you're gonna be... what is he gonna, cleaver?
[38:59.80]Oh, fuck, I thought I was controlling him, I'm an idiot.
[39:01.78]No, I'm not.
[39:02.32]It's fine.
[39:05.68]No, he's going for you!
[39:07.16]Bad!
[39:07.58]Okay, go in there.
[39:21.75]Oh, you had nothing.
[39:23.35]What'd he just do?
[39:26.95]Shield?
[39:27.41]Luck?
[39:27.69]What do you just do?
[39:33.73]Oh, these guys kinda suck.
[39:35.37]Skeletons are good.
[39:36.15]Okay, we're good.
[39:39.07]That was low morale.
[39:40.07]Okay, right, right, right.
[39:43.91]We lost five little gremlins.
[39:45.39]It's alright.
[39:46.81]75 experience and I get access to this ore pit.
[39:51.02]Two every day.
[39:52.86]Forever, unless somebody else claims this.
[39:54.60]So there's nothing else up here.
[39:55.58]Wait, artifact.
[40:00.23]Stoic Watchman?
[40:03.45]What's that?
[40:03.81]It was a Stoic Watchman.
[40:08.59]This figure increases your Eagle Eye skill by 10%.
[40:11.23]I don't even know what that is.
[40:17.25]That's hidden back here.
[40:18.09]Alright, so that's all back here.
[40:20.31]I have no more things to do.
[40:22.05]I mean, I guess I could... I only have 50... What do I have?
[40:24.33]5600? 5600...
[40:31.34]No, we just gotta end the turns.
[40:34.52]Alright, day four.
[40:41.19]So, I have learned Summoned Boat.
[40:44.75]Although I don't really know for what reason that is.
[40:49.97]Kind of went this way, but I want to get the treasure.
[40:51.68]Um... I'll take the money this time.
[40:57.94]Oh shit, a pack of Gorgons.
[41:01.85]I don't think I'll be able to beat that.
[41:08.23]Yeah, I'm not gonna chance that one.
[41:11.97]So, Sears Hut.
[41:13.82]Huh.
[41:14.14]Well, I have...
[41:33.26]I have a few of them.
[41:36.58]I don't have a whole lot.
[41:37.72]I need 60 halflings and 12... I don't have any trolls.
[41:42.24]Rally flag.
[41:44.87]It's out of turn.
[41:45.71]Let's go back to the worlds here.
[41:47.63]Alright.
[41:49.07]That's what I got.
[41:52.81]8,600.
[41:52.85]Level 2.
[41:53.39]Citadel.
[41:53.99]Marketplace.
[41:55.15]You can buy and sell resources.
[41:56.97]You exchange things back and forth.
[41:58.65]It's pretty good.
[42:01.41]Lookout Tower extends the visible distance around your city.
[42:03.57]That's pretty good, too.
[42:05.67]Allows you to recruit stone gargoyles.
[42:07.45]I feel like I'd want this upgraded workshop.
[42:10.61]Master Gremlins are available.
[42:16.34]Wall of Knowledge.
[42:17.24]Increases any hero's knowledge by plus one if they visit.
[42:26.75]I'm gonna go with this.
[42:28.65]I'm gonna go with the Citadel.
[42:30.71]It's... I mean, you need to have, like, walls.
[42:34.23]They can just walk right in.
[42:39.09]What's a library?
[42:40.55]More spells.
[42:44.08]Yeah, let's... What do I need for the City Hall?
[42:47.20]City Hall allows you to purchase town structures and earns your kingdom 2,000 gold per day.
[42:50.50]You need a Marketplace and a Blacksmith.
[42:54.04]I probably should just get the Marketplace.
[42:57.48]Yeah, let's just start that process.
[43:00.30]So as you see here, I can, you know, for instance... I think this changes week to week depending on certain outcomes and certain seasons.
[43:09.16]Some things can be worth more money.
[43:11.56]So here's the resources available to trade.
[43:13.49]So I can do... You know, I could trade gems for gold.
[43:17.69]I can trade, you know, crystals for wood.
[43:21.27]And the ratio, as you see, is not very good.
[43:25.48]But yeah, it's pretty cool.
[43:27.14]It's pretty cool.
[43:28.32]So that exists now.
[43:29.20]Let's go to the other one.
[43:31.24]Anything, nobody to recruit?
[43:34.49]Okay, what can I do here?
[43:35.61]I need to... 5,000.
[43:41.01]I don't think I have... I don't really have enough to do this.
[43:45.55]The Academy of Battle Scholars teaches new skills to any hero once.
[43:49.16]Once.
[43:54.69]Pillar of Eyes.
[43:56.48]Pillar of Eyes allows you to recruit evil eyes.
[43:59.70]What is this?
[44:02.32]You can recruit Medusas with this one.
[44:06.91]Yeah, this will... I'll get 4,000 per day.
[44:11.91]I'm going to try to just get two City Halls.
[44:17.32]Let's just go to the Marketplace.
[44:23.95]I'm starting to run out of resources here, though.
[44:25.88]Alright, let's go.
[44:29.92]Oh, shit.
[44:30.60]Oh, fuck.
[44:31.16]Oh, no.
[44:32.52]Okay, this... He's come... That's my house!
[44:34.40]He's got... This is another player.
[44:38.84]Uh... He's trying... He's gonna take me over.
[44:40.68]He's trying to take... What does he have?
[44:44.48]I have... A pretty decent... What does he have?
[44:48.51]Several... A horde of skeletons.
[44:53.15]Uh...
[44:57.32]What is his stuff?
[44:58.38]I can't... I don't know.
[45:00.14]Destroy him?
[45:02.06]Kill him!
[45:02.34]He's got a horde of skeletons!
[45:03.74]This is probably gonna be bad!
[45:04.88]Alright, I'm going for it.
[45:11.64]No, I'm not.
[45:12.88]He's gonna take the castle.
[45:17.71]I'm not prepared for him.
[45:21.15]I'm just gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna go in.
[45:26.27]Everybody!
[45:28.83]To the battle stations!
[45:36.92]Wait, I can't... Can I not place him up here?
[45:54.17]There we go.
[45:54.73]Okay.
[45:57.53]Um, can I recruit anybody?
[45:58.71]Is anybody available?
[46:04.40]There's nobody available.
[46:08.14]Uh... Should I make something and recruit someone?
[46:13.73]I don't do, I don't have enough.
[46:15.69]Two thousand, ten, and five.
[46:17.15]I don't have enough money.
[46:23.13]No, I don't have enough of, uh, what is it, ore?
[46:31.14]What am I missing?
[46:32.52]Of wood.
[46:35.41]Fuck.
[46:36.99]I need to build a citadel, quick!
[46:39.61]Okay, yeah, I need to add terrain obstacles.
[46:44.43]Pull up the bridge, let's go.
[46:48.66]Wait, hold on, I'm gonna send reinforcements.
[46:51.56]Wait, uh, hold on.
[46:54.04]Blacksmith?
[46:54.76]I need wood.
[46:55.52]I gotta go fucking find wood.
[46:56.74]How do I need to make wood?
[46:59.40]Plus one gem every day.
[47:00.76]I need wood.
[47:01.38]I need goddamn wood.
[47:07.92]But the exchange rate's probably so bad.
[47:09.89]Let's go to the market.
[47:10.59]Okay, wood.
[47:14.13]I need wood.
[47:15.81]And I'm gonna give money?
[47:16.77]I just like fucking almost restarted my computer, I think.
[47:24.29]Because I just elbowed my... This is so stupid.
[47:27.43]Supply and demand.
[47:28.44]Bullshit.
[47:31.77]Look at that!
[47:35.14]What about hay?
[47:37.90]No, these are all such bad exchange rates.
[47:49.35]God damn it.
[47:50.67]No, nothing I can do.
[47:57.19]No.
[47:59.66]How much wood do I have?
[48:00.98]I need four, right?
[48:03.38]Ugh.
[48:07.00]Trade the M&Ms.
[48:09.22]No.
[48:09.90]No, I'll be fine.
[48:10.71]I'll be fine.
[48:11.53]I'm not gonna... I've got good troops here.
[48:13.73]I've got good people here.
[48:16.15]I've got... They're garrisoned up and they're ready to go behind walls.
[48:22.63]Let's just do it.
[48:26.06]You're out here.
[48:27.54]Rally the troops.
[48:28.84]I got some luck.
[48:30.90]I got some morale.
[48:33.78]Wood!
[48:34.52]How much is it?
[48:36.21]Eight wood!
[48:39.34]Yeah, eight wood and I got some spell I get eight spell points Doesn't we don't have to end their learning stone Mercury Alright, don't don't do anything crazy here.
[48:51.49]Just get more Mercury.
[48:53.33]I can't there's an alchemist lab.
[48:54.61]What's this thing learning stone?
[48:58.01]Nimbus is now a level two necromancer Advanced necromancy or basic wisdom.
[49:04.96]Oh
[49:06.25]Allows 20% of the creatures killed in combat to be brought back from the dead as skeletons.
[49:13.47]Basic wisdom allows your hero to learn third level spells.
[49:16.41]I mean... Yeah.
[49:21.23]Now we're a real necromancer.
[49:24.58]I don't have much more wiggle room here.
[49:26.52]Alright, I need to be ready.
[49:30.58]So let's go back here.
[49:31.38]Um...
[49:36.49]Oh, I get the wood.
[49:42.63]What was I gonna build with this wood?
[49:44.31]Blacksmith, because then I can do City Hall.
[49:48.93]Yeah.
[49:49.47]Blacksmith and then City Hall.
[49:51.53]This is 5 wood, and this is 5,000.
[49:57.18]Ammo carts.
[49:59.54]There it is, Blacksmith.
[50:00.74]Only visiting heroes may use the Blacksmith.
[50:02.52]And then next week I can do a City Hall.
[50:07.52]Because I already built something here.
[50:09.38]He's just at the front fucking door.
[50:11.36]God damn it.
[50:12.00]Alright, I'm ready.
[50:13.20]Ready?
[50:15.36]3, 2, 1.
[50:17.98]He backed off?
[50:19.19]He took all my fucking shit though.
[50:23.37]He took all- I was gonna get all this stuff.
[50:25.29]Which- That was my stuff.
[50:32.75]We just ran away for no reason.
[50:34.19]I just like panicked for nothing.
[50:37.06]Kill him?
[50:37.74]He's got... How much is a horde?
[50:40.14]50 to 100?
[50:40.34]That's a lot.
[50:56.61]He's unsuspecting.
[51:01.71]Got him.
[51:03.13]Seven?
[51:03.47]I told you it was like a hundred!
[51:04.81]I told you it was a hundred!
[51:10.70]Alright, what is he?
[51:13.69]Harpy.
[51:16.35]Harpies can probably move real fast.
[51:18.35]Alright, I gotta play this smart.
[51:25.67]The hobbits.
[51:26.13]I'm gonna move you up here.
[51:31.17]Because I think, can you cast, like, spells?
[51:48.61]They can't go through the rocks.
[51:53.88]I'm terrified of this person.
[51:57.28]Protect the frog at all costs.
[51:59.34]Now, this is okay.
[52:00.18]This will be fine.
[52:00.66]Alright, you ready?
[52:04.70]I'm ready.
[52:09.56]Okay.
[52:11.08]Let's get a spell out here.
[52:12.34]I got Magic Arrow.
[52:16.73]On...
[52:21.13]On the whites.
[52:23.97]Or on the skeletons.
[52:24.97]It has to be the... 59.
[52:27.53]It does 10 every time.
[52:28.57]I'm staying where I am.
[52:29.51]Defend.
[52:34.03]It's not great range, but it's enough.
[52:38.05]That's bad.
[52:38.81]Oh, fuck.
[52:39.21]Okay, hold on.
[52:40.59]Oh, the hobbits are ranged!
[52:41.67]I don't have any... I can't do any more spells.
[52:51.47]Who's priority right now?
[52:56.03]Probably the whites.
[52:59.18]Look at the damage.
[53:03.36]Not bad, alright.
[53:08.42]Should I just throw like these fucking... green onions up here?
[53:15.75]Should I just make the green onions go forward first?
[53:22.94]Okay, here we go.
[53:29.57]Oh god, that hurts.
[53:31.37]That hurts.
[53:33.65]No, not a good opportunity.
[53:35.25]They have good attack, but I don't want to just throw them up there.
[53:37.32]They'll get hurt.
[53:39.06]Stay here.
[53:39.72]Defend.
[53:41.06]Spell.
[53:50.11]Defend.
[53:51.57]Good opportunity here.
[53:53.51]Good.
[53:55.35]Oh!
[53:57.45]Oh no, they're getting closer.
[53:58.55]They're getting closer.
[54:01.71]It's alright.
[54:02.39]The green onions are dead.
[54:08.56]Four.
[54:10.24]Oh, it's getting close.
[54:10.86]Here we go.
[54:12.38]Should I go for the whites or should I go for the skeletons?
[54:18.23]I think I gotta go for the whites.
[54:20.44]But there's so many more skeletons, though.
[54:23.98]Get in there!
[54:27.22]Oh no, he's creeping up!
[54:29.46]Come on, let's go, naked guy!
[54:32.85]I'm thinking Harpies.
[54:37.01]Defense.
[54:37.91]Damage 1 to 4.
[54:40.47]Damage 1 to 3.
[54:45.41]I gotta whittle down the skeletons.
[54:47.99]We're at 28.
[54:52.97]I'm going for the lights.
[55:01.23]That's a great power to have.
[55:02.55]Come on.
[55:03.80]I'm going to... Maybe I should back you up.
[55:09.44]I think I'm going to go back.
[55:13.70]Yes!
[55:13.92]Alright, I'm going to move the hobbits.
[55:16.94]They need to stay alive.
[55:22.78]Uh... We're gonna have... Okay, we're gonna have to have naked guy versus half-naked guy.
[55:34.34]Ah!
[55:41.02]They do a lot of damage.
[55:41.81]Alright, here we go.
[55:43.99]Should I... I think... I think it's time to sacrifice you.
[55:49.01]I'm gonna fly down here.
[55:54.68]I don't have any spell points.
[55:56.09]I'm out of mana.
[55:58.27]Out of mana.
[56:05.09]24.
[56:05.91]20.
[56:10.35]I can't really run.
[56:11.19]Just... Uh-oh.
[56:18.50]Keep fighting over here.
[56:19.34]He's a pretty good tank.
[56:25.74]Okay, here we go.
[56:26.48]Ready?
[56:28.24]Ten skeletons left.
[56:29.18]Eight.
[56:31.75]Four.
[56:34.17]Yes!
[56:35.29]This is a victory here.
[56:36.13]This is a good victory.
[56:41.11]Um, I can't go that far.
[56:42.39]Let's get it closer so I can do it next time.
[56:51.40]The en- No!
[56:52.24]The enemy has fled!
[56:55.47]He ran away with one guy.
[56:57.01]Okay.
[57:08.48]Where did he flee?
[57:09.68]No, he's dead.
[57:16.46]He literally disintegrated.
[57:19.80]Yeah, he's dead.
[57:20.44]He's gone.
[57:21.34]He abandoned the cause.
[57:22.24]Okay, because I didn't kill him.
[57:24.26]I win.
[57:25.64]Good fight.
[57:26.10]Good victory.
[57:28.83]You all deserve a raise.
[57:29.89]Spell scroll.
[57:31.63]Just as you bend to pick up the old parchment, you hear something move behind you.
[57:36.01]Turning around, you notice some marksmen in the trees.
[57:38.61]You are not really sure why, but you get the feeling that if you pick up the parchment, they will attack.
[57:43.98]Do you want to pick up the parchment?
[57:46.30]I don't... Not after fighting all that.
[57:51.79]I don't have enough... It'll still be there.
[57:57.86]No, it'll be there.
[57:58.58]I just... I... I... I... No.
[58:03.46]What have we got over here?
[58:14.53]So we've got this already.
[58:16.65]A pack of stone golems.
[58:18.59]I've got a pretty decent crew, right?
[58:28.12]Damage 4 to 5.
[58:30.14]Damage 1 to 3.
[58:32.46]Damage 2 to 3.
[58:35.16]These guys are slow and they can't move very far.
[58:36.80]Let's just shield everybody up.
[58:41.87]Well, not yet.
[58:42.35]Hold on.
[58:44.77]None of them are ranged.
[58:57.81]I mean, this thing actually is pretty strong.
[58:59.61]Only three of them left.
[59:02.24]Should I run?
[59:09.52]The cowardly Nimbus flees from battle.
[59:13.75]What?
[59:14.89]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:17.11]Hold on.
[59:17.49]Wait a minute.
[59:17.79]Is he dead?
[59:21.63]Where is he?
[59:22.09]Oh.
[60:00.71]I didn't know that's what happened.
[60:01.89]It's been a while.
[60:02.63]I didn't know that when you retreat, they just delete themselves.
[60:06.75]Okay, so I'm not going to fight you.
[60:09.77]A pack of gogs.
[60:10.81]I don't know if I can do that either.
[60:14.26]Would you like to recruit gremlins?
[60:17.10]16 gremlins join your army.
[60:18.12]Nice.
[60:20.04]And there's a chest here.
[60:22.30]Ooh, what is that?
[60:29.72]This orb helps you recover three extra spell points per day.
[60:33.69]Nice.
[60:36.39]Pretty nice.
[60:40.23]Although I can't get this stuff, unfortunately.
[60:42.89]I kind of need to just go down to the other... I'm too weak to do any of that.
[60:50.42]Alright, what do we got?
[60:55.26]I think I can do Citadels, right?
[60:56.50]In a...
[60:59.12]City Hall.
[61:01.42]2,000 extra gold per day.
[61:03.98]Do it.
[61:04.28]5,000.
[61:04.60]Bingo.
[61:08.30]Our growth has increased.
[61:11.14]The capital building is the new one.
[61:19.80]Pretty nice, although I'm out of resources, though.
[61:23.65]This can also be done.
[61:25.91]No, I need a blacksmith.
[61:28.60]I don't have enough wood.
[61:32.13]But I think I'm just gonna trade for it.
[61:35.85]With one of my, like, pots.
[61:39.37]Yeah.
[61:41.59]Because I won't be able to do this stuff next week.
[61:52.08]Blacksmith.
[61:52.50]I need to deck this place up.
[62:00.28]New turn!
[62:02.84]Weirdly enough, I've only seen that one person.
[62:05.12]Aren't there like four or five people on this map?
[62:11.58]I'm just gonna head down here.
[62:16.58]I'm gonna have to use that whole day to do this, though.
[62:19.36]Alright, almost done with the first week, almost.
[62:28.72]Which brings us to here.
[62:31.20]I don't think I can get over here.
[62:32.34]There's just that.
[62:33.55]Red Keymaster's Tent is being guarded by a pack of Gorgons.
[62:38.35]They're probably really strong, though.
[62:44.28]PvP versus viewers, I don't have the new version.
[62:47.94]This is the old GOG version.
[62:49.70]There's no multiplayer.
[62:52.85]It's unfortunate because the new version is kind of all fucked up and messed up in a lot of places.
[62:59.43]The old version's way better, but doesn't have, like, multiplayer capabilities.
[63:06.45]Wait, the good old GOG one does?
[63:08.65]Isn't it, like, LAN?
[63:13.79]Seachest!
[63:20.73]Where's my spell book?
[63:22.73]Should I get in the boat?
[63:24.05]No, no, no, I need to... Okay, we're almost done with the first week.
[63:25.63]I can recruit some people.
[63:30.49]Yeah, not yet, not yet.
[63:31.69]That's a pretty good idea, but hold on.
[63:34.58]I don't have any money for anything.
[63:39.12]I could do the citadel here.
[63:40.38]Resource silo.
[63:43.30]Citadel.
[63:43.86]I'm just going to run out of money.
[63:47.44]I probably should citadel this.
[63:53.30]Stone is... No, give me this.
[64:00.79]Nine per week.
[64:01.35]I'll get eight.
[64:02.23]I'll get more.
[64:02.69]4,000 gold.
[64:05.91]Looks alright.
[64:09.41]Okay.
[64:10.11]Let's go over here.
[64:12.85]Portal of Summoning.
[64:13.77]I don't even know what that means.
[64:16.07]The Harpy Loft allows you to recruit Harpy Hags.
[64:19.71]So what do I have?
[64:20.53]I have these.
[64:21.99]These Harpies.
[64:22.68]Regular Harpies.
[64:23.42]I can upgrade the Harpies and then we get new, better ones next week.
[64:27.66]I'm going for it.
[64:32.12]Here they are.
[64:32.58]Harpy, Hags, and regular Harpies.
[64:36.16]Two different versions.
[64:38.54]Damage 1 to 4.
[64:41.62]Attack 6-6.
[64:44.61]6-5.
[64:45.51]And these are much faster.
[64:48.66]Strike and return, and no enemy retaliation on the upgraded ones.
[64:51.98]That's pretty good.
[64:52.44]Alright, we'll see it next week.
[65:00.49]First week is about to be complete.
[65:02.91]I don't have anything else I can do.
[65:06.45]Astrologers proclaim Week of the Condor.
[65:08.85]All dwellings increase population.
[65:12.75]Alright, let's take a look at what that does.
[65:15.99]Nice.
[65:17.47]So we've got a lot of options here.
[65:18.59]I've got 6,000 gold.
[65:19.29]Should I just pull everybody?
[65:24.76]3750 for 18 Gargoyles, 17 Comedy Gremlins, and 6 Naked Guys.
[65:37.84]I think that's pretty good.
[65:43.82]Recruit them all.
[65:46.32]You guys can stay there for now.
[65:50.16]And then let's go here.
[65:53.52]Let's recruit all here.
[65:54.54]I don't fucking have any money.
[66:01.97]I need to... Oh, shit.
[66:06.07]I need to... Okay, I gotta go.
[66:08.65]Let's fill that up.
[66:10.03]Come here.
[66:12.51]Um...
[66:17.43]Damn it, I... No, it's gotta... This is a pretty decent team so far.
[66:32.33]44... 29, 18, 6, and 6.
[66:36.95]These guys are strong, these guys are strong.
[66:49.45]So now, shouldn't, can I do this?
[66:54.80]Uh, I have to spend, yeah, I might as well just do it.
[66:59.70]So now I have better harpies here.
[67:03.19]No, just, you sit around for a minute, until I get a little bit more money.
[67:06.01]Because I'm going to have you go into the ocean.
[67:12.47]You've got enough troops where you're, of course, to be reckoned with here.
[67:17.52]We've got, uh, witch hut.
[67:21.97]This will have to be next week.
[67:23.09]I don't have any money to do anything, so let's keep going.
[67:26.55]What?
[67:30.13]What did I say?
[67:30.45]That too.
[67:30.83]Witch's hut.
[67:47.02]An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you, teaching you offense for her own indestructible purposes.
[67:53.20]I learned basic offense.
[67:55.58]Thanks.
[67:55.86]Increases all hand-to-hand damage inflicted by the hero's troops by 10%.
[68:01.44]In... what did I say?
[68:13.62]Gnoll Marauders.
[68:15.44]You really need to get these.
[68:16.54]I got a lot of troops.
[68:18.74]20 spell points.
[68:22.24]I think I can take them.
[68:27.70]No.
[68:27.90]Let them run.
[68:42.02]In awe at the... Of an awe at just the absolute size of this unit.
[68:46.89]Two wood a day.
[68:47.65]That's good, I need it.
[68:56.33]Money or... Mr. Experience.
[68:59.49]Nice.
[69:00.43]Level 3.
[69:01.59]Expert Necromancy or Fire Magic.
[69:05.21]Expert Necromancy allows 30% of the creatures killed in combat to be brought back from the dead as skeletons.
[69:09.68]I mean, there's...
[69:11.85]Why would I do anything else at this point?
[69:13.89]This is, like, the Resurrector.
[69:15.78]Okay, cool.
[69:19.78]I don't think I want to do anything else.
[69:24.92]I want to do a boat with you.
[69:25.92]How much money do I have now?
[69:28.96]Alright, I can do this.
[69:33.77]I want to do Upgraded.
[69:34.95]I'm going to upgrade these other hags.
[69:43.48]So if I pull everybody, these hags?
[69:46.60]Yes, they are.
[69:47.06]Okay.
[69:48.54]Recruit them.
[69:49.10]Get them all.
[69:52.09]Alright.
[69:52.61]We have a forest now.
[69:55.17]I don't have any more money, but I want to summon the boat over here.
[70:00.77]How do I summon the boat?
[70:07.98]Where's my spell book?
[70:15.17]That's one thing I don't... There it is.
[70:16.81]Cast a spell.
[70:17.59]Summon boat.
[70:20.33]That spell costs eight spell points.
[70:21.77]We have six.
[70:23.15]God damn it.
[70:23.95]We only have six points?
[70:29.14]Well, you hang out here and just take care of the castle for a while.
[70:39.38]Next day.
[70:43.70]What I have for... Alright, so we're going down this way, Hut of the Magi.
[70:47.56]You enter a rickety hut and talk to the magician who lives there.
[70:50.12]He tells you a place near and far which may aid you in your journey.
[70:54.62]Oh, shit.
[70:56.08]Oh, shit!
[70:57.05]Look at that!
[71:00.57]Look at these things.
[71:03.79]Bears, the Colosseum.
[71:06.45]He's just revealing everything for us.
[71:08.03]Look at this dude.
[71:10.25]Holy fuck, thanks, man.
[71:11.39]Alright, so let's see, where am I now?
[71:19.13]Right here.
[71:20.29]So if we go down, there is... We got a shipyard.
[71:27.18]A lot of stuff.
[71:28.56]There's some wraiths.
[71:29.72]There's a gem factory.
[71:33.18]Golem factory.
[71:35.07]Subterranean rocks.
[71:36.01]There's a little ship out here.
[71:39.94]There's the eye.
[71:40.58]Uh, let's just go down here first.
[71:44.21]Actually, this is like the top.
[71:45.33]Let me see.
[71:47.91]There's another castle over here.
[71:49.03]Let me just see what it is.
[71:54.07]What is this?
[71:54.68]University.
[72:00.86]Yo, heroes' footsteps echo through the quiet halls of this ancient university.
[72:05.17]A clerk informs you that while here, your hero may receive instruction on the following subjects.
[72:12.30]Offense.
[72:13.74]Logistics.
[72:14.82]Learning of first aid.
[72:16.18]You cannot learn first aid.
[72:18.90]This will cost 2,000 gold.
[72:20.34]Basic logistics.
[72:21.50]Increase your hero's movement points over land so you get to move 10% more each turn.
[72:25.72]More basic learning.
[72:28.38]5% more experience.
[72:33.69]But it's also all my money.
[72:41.72]10% more movement per turn or 5% more overall experience.
[72:50.34]Tuition for learning basic logistics is 2,000 gold.
[72:52.54]Let's do it.
[72:59.36]Hey, why don't I just do them both?
[73:04.34]No, not free.
[73:06.26]Should I do them both?
[73:10.28]Oh, I can't.
[73:12.50]Right, okay.
[73:13.62]I thought it was already in real time updating that.
[73:16.76]Well, okay, I can move more.
[73:17.92]I can't really build anything in a thousand gold.
[73:27.83]How many spell points do I have?
[73:32.25]What do you have for spell points?
[73:33.25]Eight!
[73:33.63]Alright, let's go!
[73:36.01]It's time!
[73:39.32]Cast the boat.
[73:40.02]We're getting that chest in the middle of the ocean.
[73:45.18]Boat.
[73:51.12]What?
[73:58.97]What?
[73:59.31]That's a 50% chance.
[74:01.41]Go back to bed.
[74:03.45]Get some sleep.
[74:05.81]We'll try again tomorrow.
[74:07.03]Uh-oh.
[74:10.49]That guy just killed somebody.
[74:15.47]Where's that person?
[74:16.13]I think they're on a different continent.
[74:23.43]Alright, things are getting interesting.
[74:26.55]Take a nap and go again.
[74:27.75]Alright, so there we go.
[74:28.47]We got... War Machine Factory.
[74:32.58]Oh, damn.
[74:34.28]Recruit Ballistas.
[74:37.82]Ahhhh!
[74:40.16]This is so expensive, but this is so powerful.
[74:43.94]Give me one.
[74:50.12]Can I not do it?
[74:51.86]No, I can do it.
[74:56.67]Look at this shit.
[75:01.01]I want like a ton of these.
[75:03.79]Worth it.
[75:07.97]I'm taking the money.
[75:11.74]Den of Thieves, or do I go up to the Harpy Hags?
[75:15.82]Look at that.
[75:16.50]A pack of silver pegasi.
[75:20.01]Protecting a gold mine.
[75:24.51]Let's go this way.
[75:25.05]Den of Thieves.
[75:30.29]Oh, this tells you about...
[75:38.92]So here we go, number of towns.
[75:50.52]Oh shit, artifacts, kingdom, army, income.
[75:55.32]So I'm the green flag, right?
[75:58.48]Best hero, personality, human.
[76:07.03]What is that?
[76:07.57]Is that a goat?
[76:09.27]Best monster is my beholders.
[76:11.35]This is cool, though, because it can show you just how... That's interesting.
[76:19.57]Alright, so we know how to be careful.
[76:23.65]A pack of mummies.
[76:26.66]And a sulfur mound.
[76:29.20]There's a coliseum here.
[76:30.42]Arena.
[76:32.84]Thousand experience?
[76:34.02]I'll take it.
[76:36.21]Thanks for 1,000 HP.
[76:36.91]And that's all we can do for now.
[76:39.71]Alright, how's the other guy doing?
[76:46.67]Two spell points!
[76:47.81]It's not... You know what?
[76:48.57]Fuck it.
[76:49.59]We got places to be.
[76:51.73]Just... I want that sea chest so bad.
[76:57.33]Ugh.
[76:58.47]Somebody right here?
[76:59.02]No, it's me.
[77:03.12]Go for the cow?
[77:04.52]I don't know if I can do it.
[77:06.50]Oh no, I can go for the... I'll go for the scroll.
[77:09.96]Okay, here we go.
[77:10.76]I've got a decent army here.
[77:11.96]I've got, like, pretty good hags.
[77:15.04]You get the feeling that if you pick up this parchment, they're going to attack.
[77:19.50]Oh my god.
[77:20.92]What have I done?
[77:21.40]Uh, this is impossible.
[77:31.83]I won't do this.
[77:41.81]Must be something pretty good, yeah.
[77:43.40]But I'm gonna lose everybody anyways.
[78:15.11]Everybody hide.
[78:16.16]These guys are magicians.
[78:17.10]They're gonna fucking kill everybody.
[78:18.22]No, I'm not sending the frogs out.
[78:25.30]I'm gonna see if it's even doable.
[78:33.67]I don't have any fucking spell points.
[78:44.21]Uh... This is... That's a... Guys, these guys have crossbows.
[78:49.09]This guy's dead.
[78:50.93]Dude, he just is.
[78:52.85]And I could retreat and then redo, but... It's over.
[78:59.88]Might as well try to take as many O's as I can.
[79:05.40]I'm gonna stay back here, though.
[79:08.86]Oh, this is bad.
[79:10.32]Very bad.
[79:15.77]Didn't even kill one of them.
[79:16.97]The hobbits are dead.
[79:24.90]Send out the frogs.
[79:28.12]No!
[79:28.88]I like these guys!
[79:40.52]At least... Let's try to take a piece off before we go down!
[79:48.36]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[79:49.38]Okay.
[80:16.68]No rewinds.
[80:19.36]I'm not gonna save, scum.
[80:21.72]That was an outcome that... I went for the item.
[80:25.30]I went for the spell scroll, and it was like, hey, be careful!
[80:29.79]And I got fucking wrecked.
[80:31.17]That's just the way it is.
[80:32.61]It's okay.
[80:35.61]It's alright.
[80:36.19]It's okay.
[80:37.09]This is the guy that's level, like, three.
[80:40.62]He knows what he's doing.
[80:41.38]He's got a great military here of undead creatures.
[80:44.08]He's got more spell points.
[80:45.08]This guy's way better.
[80:47.40]Alright, I'll get a new one.
[80:49.59]We'll get a better hero.
[80:52.35]For instance.
[80:53.31]Like, take a look.
[80:53.91]Ready?
[80:54.11]Ah, where's the tavern?
[80:59.11]Yeah, I mean, already I like these two more.
[81:03.90]This is a death knight.
[81:08.40]Or should we get this guy?
[81:09.50]Thane?
[81:13.62]Or Volkiel?
[81:14.68]Volkiel.
[81:18.48]We're going with Thane?
[81:21.90]Alright.
[81:22.86]Alchemist.
[81:26.34]Wait, don't we already have an Alchemist?
[81:27.94]We know we did.
[81:30.84]Thane.
[81:31.24]I mean, I kind of need Thane.
[81:38.66]But Death Knight is like... Let's compare them.
[81:42.98]So Death Knight starts with... Okay, hold on.
[81:46.05]So Death Knight starts with the skeletons and the wraiths.
[81:50.63]This is necromancy and artillery.
[81:53.85]Specializes in vampires.
[81:56.11]Okay.
[81:57.73]This is gargoyles and gremlins.
[82:00.05]Is an advanced scholar.
[82:01.19]Has a bunch of points and specializes in genies.
[82:05.53]Hmm.
[82:08.01]This is a scholar.
[82:08.97]We have a necromancer already.
[82:17.08]I'm gonna go with the genie.
[82:17.84]You hang out there for a while.
[82:23.85]You're gonna have two?
[82:30.77]Yeah, I know.
[82:31.47]I just want to spread it out a little bit.
[82:33.10]Don't bite off more than I can chew.
[82:39.00]We're starting to get to the stage where people are starting to move around.
[82:41.50]Oh!
[82:46.98]They have a terrible, they have a shit army though.
[82:49.14]This army sucks.
[82:53.82]This army sucks.
[82:56.66]What do I kill first?
[83:02.56]These guys are terrible.
[83:03.84]I can't even attack the skeletons.
[83:09.86]I can't, I can't go that far.
[83:13.92]Okay.
[83:15.38]Skeletons.
[83:18.66]You're not gonna get in here.
[83:20.68]This is an impenetrable fort.
[83:21.92]You're not getting in.
[83:22.94]I'll kill you all before you get in here.
[83:24.99]Good thing we took the magician.
[83:36.27]Oh, wait, they can fucking throw in here!
[83:38.61]Oh, fuck!
[83:43.19]Oh no, they can get in here!
[83:47.63]Oh, eat shit.
[83:50.09]We're fine, everything's fine.
[83:59.44]Yes!
[84:01.88]Just stay behind the walls!
[84:04.86]Ow!
[84:10.49]Alright, get in there, and then get out.
[84:17.55]What?!
[84:19.11]Wait, what happened?!
[84:20.47]Why did he die?!
[84:21.69]He landed in the pit!
[84:30.02]That's not fair!
[84:30.98]He got boiled in the oil!
[84:48.77]Shit!
[84:49.67]I just bought you!
[84:50.76]You were like 2500 gold!
[84:58.27]Do not apply- I- I- I have- I have to.
[85:02.07]I can't just redo every battle.
[85:11.12]You can't just redo every single time.
[85:14.35]It was dumb.
[85:15.01]Yeah, but now I learn.
[85:17.07]Don't worry.
[85:17.93]I'll get it back.
[85:19.51]Guys, don't worry.
[85:20.33]I'll get it back.
[85:21.73]That was a dumb mistake.
[85:24.99]Rewind.
[85:25.49]Was it dumb?
[85:33.25]Alright, let's go.
[85:38.67]Alright, it's the only time I'm gonna rewind in the whole day.
[85:42.73]I promise.
[85:43.85]Just don't land in boiling oil.
[85:46.19]Alright, kill this motherfucker.
[85:59.20]Alright, everyone can just defend.
[86:03.38]Defend.
[86:03.88]Defend.
[86:06.40]Take him out.
[86:09.52]Got my Medusa Archers.
[86:19.63]Do not let him in here.
[86:20.75]Alright.
[86:22.61]Everybody defend.
[86:23.33]I'm going to lose the Gremlins.
[86:25.85]Are you going to burn in the oil?
[86:30.53]You can't get in here, can you?
[86:32.73]I'm not doing that.
[86:35.65]Ow.
[86:36.32]Oh, fuck.
[86:42.52]They have to die now.
[86:48.34]Yes!
[86:52.70]Fain receives 722 experience.
[86:56.36]We have pushed them back.
[87:02.33]That person's collecting all my stuff!
[87:07.83]That person's taking all the things that I want.
[87:09.49]A pack of mummies.
[87:15.89]That's a sulfur mine.
[87:20.73]Save the game.
[87:26.00]Okay.
[87:27.88]I wonder if a pack of mummies will be able to take me on.
[87:32.66]This is a pretty good crew here.
[87:34.32]I mean, like, really?
[87:37.26]What do they got?
[87:38.34]Not very much.
[87:39.08]I think they're ranged, though.
[87:44.74]No, they're not ranged.
[87:45.52]Alright.
[87:46.04]Good to know.
[87:48.56]Alright, let's move the gremlins forward.
[87:53.14]I don't think I need to cast any spells here.
[87:54.86]They have Curse.
[88:02.11]I forget what curse does.
[88:02.89]Oh, hang on, hold on a second here.
[88:06.55]Stone skin, shield, magic arrow.
[88:10.11]Just lame it out in the corner.
[88:11.63]Let's try magic arrow on you.
[88:18.23]Holy shit.
[88:19.61]Okay.
[88:22.51]Um.
[88:24.72]These guys are pretty tough.
[88:27.10]Skeletons, move in.
[88:31.10]Butchers!
[88:35.73]Butchers, move in.
[88:39.31]Naked guys, move in.
[88:43.45]I wanted more of these.
[88:44.23]Alright, here we go.
[88:49.98]I'm gonna get a little bounce back here.
[88:52.48]Get it.
[88:52.70]Oof.
[88:58.30]It's alright, we're doing fine.
[89:03.69]They're right in front of you.
[89:05.25]In fact... Stoneskin?
[89:08.19]Defense?
[89:09.09]Shield?
[89:11.29]Hmm.
[89:13.77]Which one's better?
[89:14.35]They both do the same kind of thing, right?
[89:18.06]Dispel.
[89:21.50]Slow.
[89:24.12]We'll do Stoneskin.
[89:29.58]Nah, we're fine.
[89:31.11]Move in.
[89:41.09]We got three more.
[89:41.85]Uh-oh.
[89:44.07]Cursed?
[89:46.07]Yeah, he's cursed.
[89:46.77]Oh, they're both cursed.
[89:51.03]What does the curse do, though?
[89:53.73]Curse duration three rounds.
[89:54.85]Spell's affecting the army, but what does it do?
[89:56.69]I think we'll be fine.
[89:59.63]That's one down.
[90:02.33]Skeleton's coming up from the back.
[90:06.97]And Butcher coming up from the left.
[90:09.44]Okay, we're good.
[90:15.33]Level 4.
[90:19.23]Advanced eagle eye or water magic.
[90:22.61]Spell power plus one.
[90:25.09]Advanced eagle eye gives your hero a 50% chance to learn any spell up to third level used in combat.
[90:32.73]Or allows your hero to cast water spells at a reduced cost.
[90:39.43]50% chance to learn any spell up to third level?
[90:42.92]What does that mean?
[90:46.47]I mean, maybe we should just try it.
[90:47.71]Alright, one salt for a day is not going to come from here.
[90:54.71]Let me see.
[90:56.57]What does that do?
[91:06.11]Spell.
[91:07.48]It's just all learn from the enemy here.
[91:10.28]Okay, I see.
[91:11.38]That's interesting.
[91:11.78]That's pretty cool.
[91:14.64]Alright, what do I want to do now?
[91:17.66]I have this... Alright, let's... 35, 33, 15, 6, 6.
[91:25.91]Pack of wood elves.
[91:28.47]I should... I don't have any range, though.
[91:31.09]I think I'm gonna avoid them for now.
[91:36.22]Yeah, I'll avoid them for now.
[91:37.10]Let's get the chest.
[91:40.08]Experience.
[91:40.80]Level up.
[91:41.34]That's alright.
[91:42.04]Get the crystals!
[91:42.88]Crystals!
[91:44.98]Idol of Fortune.
[91:45.74]I don't think I can go here unless these are dead.
[91:51.40]Is Thane still alive?
[91:52.78]Yes.
[91:54.40]Alright, Thane.
[91:55.10]Just hang out there for now.
[91:57.92]I'm going to recruit the frogs.
[92:02.99]I don't think I can do much.
[92:07.67]Nobody to recruit.
[92:10.97]Go on.
[92:13.94]That guy's in a boat.
[92:15.20]They're getting a lot of stuff done on their turns.
[92:21.02]A pack of nomads.
[92:29.41]I'm so timid.
[92:30.25]Idle of Fortune.
[92:30.89]Got more morale.
[92:43.38]Gems.
[92:46.16]Silver Wing Tower.
[92:47.64]There's nobody here.
[92:50.70]Shit's fucking empty.
[92:51.82]I'll take it.
[92:57.56]It's empty!
[93:02.96]Alright, let's relax here.
[93:04.48]And you got gremlins?
[93:07.33]I'll take them.
[93:07.75]I got 59 gremlins.
[93:15.73]This is an actual empty town, though.
[93:17.73]I already have a fort.
[93:24.05]2,000 gold per day.
[93:24.73]I could have just a huge income.
[93:29.24]Marketplace.
[93:32.92]Going for it.
[93:33.38]Get a marketplace up here.
[93:34.72]Hang out in there for now.
[93:38.62]4,000 gold.
[93:43.13]Mage guild 1, scholar... Okay, hold on a minute.
[93:47.19]Allows you to recruit evil eyes.
[93:50.89]Yes.
[93:54.39]Oh, damn.
[93:54.95]Okay, what's the difference?
[93:56.19]Beholder's evil eyes.
[93:58.25]So Beholder is just that.
[93:59.71]This is no melee penalty.
[94:03.17]10 attack, 8 defense.
[94:04.73]Just better.
[94:05.19]Shoots 24 shots.
[94:07.09]3 to 5.

[95:44.74]Blacksmith.
[95:45.40]Let's get that city hall up.
[95:49.32]Only visiting heroes may use the blacksmith.
[95:52.54]I can't, like, use that?
[95:54.02]I guess I don't have anything to use it.
[95:55.18]Alright, what else?

[99:14.59]Pack of wood elves.
[99:15.39]I should be able to take them as well.
[99:19.21]I still have plenty of points.
[99:20.11]I got plenty of people.
[99:22.39]I should be able to get these wood elves, but they've ranged.
[99:24.53]That's the only thing that concerns me.
[99:27.33]No, let's just park it right here.
[99:29.79]I need, like, to get the other hero going.
[99:33.83]But he just... You can't do any exploring with this group of fucking idiots.
[99:41.63]Is, uh, necromancy automatic?
[99:43.53]I think it is.
[99:44.03]Alright, let's keep going.
[99:52.00]Oh, no.
[99:52.14]Again?!
[99:52.26]They're gonna take it!
[99:53.04]Again?!

[100:22.69]Whites.
[100:25.47]Oh, man.
[100:28.51]Ah, man.
[100:29.33]I can't get over there.
[100:31.24]I have just the towers, but he's going to cast spells and kill them.
[100:37.52]I have such a small crew.
[100:47.13]This is bad.
[100:59.19]Not good.
[101:00.29]Very bad.
[101:01.35]Very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad, very bad.
[101:07.10]It's over!
[101:10.76]It's over.
[101:11.24]Yeah, I just have to accept the defeat here.
[101:17.87]He's gonna just shoot.
[101:18.79]Oh, he's gonna shoot through every time.
[101:21.58]How much, how many spell points does he have?
[101:22.88]Yeah, I'm dead.
[101:23.84]Yeah, that's it.
[101:26.50]Game over.
[101:37.12]Oh, it was my, like, younger brother, Thaint.
[101:40.82]Came to attack Thain's.
[101:42.97]Thaint came to get Thain's stuff.
[101:49.46]Thant versus Thane.
[101:57.65]Oh, well.
[101:58.91]Astrologers proclaim week of the badger.
[102:00.73]All dwellings have increased population.
[102:02.19]That's why we need to, like... This is going to have to be our real stronghold.
[102:15.49]I spread myself a little too thin here.
[102:20.19]Alright, what do I... This is a good place.
[102:21.83]Let's really upgrade this stuff.
[102:23.77]Obsidian Gargoyles.
[102:26.15]Iron Golems.
[102:28.05]Can recruit Mages.
[102:31.67]How much is this?
[102:33.03]Let's get some Mages.
[102:37.21]And... 1800.
[102:37.43]Recruit everybody.
[102:41.30]No, not yet.
[102:42.32]Not yet.
[102:45.00]Not yet.
[102:47.90]Mages are damn good.
[102:49.06]But I'm not gonna get them yet.
[102:51.34]Because I have to upgrade these guys.
[102:52.52]Let's get at least the mages.
[102:56.48]Yeah, these guys are fucking awesome.
[102:59.90]And let's pull out the gremlins.
[103:01.30]Because we already have, obviously, the upgrade there.
[103:05.18]Get them all.
[103:08.07]That's all I can afford.
[103:08.83]Fuck, I'm out of money.
[103:17.07]Are they going to attack the city from the portal?
[103:20.23]Fuck.
[103:23.90]They're gonna come for that town next week!
[103:29.11]From this portal!
[103:30.07]And I've got four wizards protecting it.
[103:34.83]I don't have any money.
[103:36.43]I should've fucking taken the money before in the beginning.
[103:42.52]I've gotta start to fucking cash in something here.
[103:46.52]I gotta- I have to try to make something happen.
[103:49.68]Do you wish to pursue him?
[103:50.34]No, let him run.
[103:51.74]I wanna go into the arena.
[103:54.28]You enter the arena and face a pack of vicious lions.
[103:56.54]You handily defeat them.
[103:58.56]To the wild cheers of the crowd.
[104:00.42]Impressed by your skill, the aged trainer of gladiators agrees to train you in a skill of your choice.
[104:05.75]+2 attack or +2 defense.
[104:09.13]This could be the run saver right here.
[104:15.09]Attack.
[104:20.61]That's pretty damn good.
[104:21.46]Although his defense... I don't have any... Okay.
[104:25.03]That was good.
[104:25.71]That was good.
[104:28.53]I need a hero.
[104:30.95]Lots of harpy hags.
[104:32.11]Lots of centaur captains.
[104:35.20]The university is over here.
[104:36.56]The war machine factory.
[104:37.84]I don't know.
[104:42.36]A pack of silver pegasi.
[104:47.28]Can I get them?
[104:48.58]I might not be able to kill them.
[104:50.48]Don't come attack me, please.
[104:52.64]Don't come attack me.
[104:53.26]Don't come attack me.
[105:16.23]What ha- what?
[105:23.15]Where was that?
[105:23.86]It was a scripted event?
[105:30.77]Was this a scenario event?
[105:32.11]I had to pay, like, somebody robbed me?
[105:35.01]Taxes?
[105:37.79]Oh, that was actual taxes.
[105:39.27]I needed that money this week.
[105:40.77]This day.
[105:41.73]So bad!
[105:43.45]Fuck.
[105:43.93]Okay, well... Here we go.
[105:46.41]I would have just bought another one of these!
[105:48.07]I need the money.
[105:50.93]I need the money.
[105:57.86]I need the money.
[105:58.38]I have to recruit people.
[106:09.87]No, not lots of harpies.
[106:11.17]Let's get the gold.
[106:12.97]600.
[106:14.71]Temple.
[106:16.75]Got some luck.
[106:18.07]Alright.
[106:18.67]More gold.
[106:21.05]And a pack of silver pegasi.
[106:25.63]During, like, Christmas or something.
[106:31.50]This is bad.
[106:32.08]I can't do it.
[106:37.02]What about the harpy hags?
[106:38.58]I might be able to get the harpies.
[106:43.53]There's an obelisk right here.
[106:51.92]I'm not sure what I want to do here.
[106:55.84]Lots of harpy hags.
[106:57.98]No.
[107:01.72]I'm fucked.
[107:04.16]I'm so fucked.
[107:06.75]I just need to just dial up the defense.
[107:08.93]Recruit.
[107:11.07]No, not yet.
[107:11.55]Hold on.
[107:14.46]Obsidian Gargoyles.
[107:17.68]There we go.
[107:19.26]Alright, pull them in.
[107:25.13]Let's see the difference.
[107:29.19]Speed, they're just faster.
[107:30.33]Okay, now how much money do I got?
[107:32.49]Thirteen?
[107:34.37]Recruit as many as I can.
[107:38.98]I have thirteen hundred.
[107:39.84]Come on, recruit.
[107:47.36]Wait, what?
[107:49.18]Oh, okay.
[107:49.96]I can't afford it.
[107:53.84]I have to at least have something here.
[107:55.18]I have 30 gold.
[107:59.28]Fuck!
[108:00.00]I'm in so much trouble.
[108:01.34]Why do they have to take all my money?
[108:02.70]I was just getting ready.
[108:03.90]Guys like sailing the seven goddamn seas.
[108:15.67]Okay, 3,000.
[108:16.47]Recruit everybody.
[108:21.75]There we go.
[108:23.21]I have now the obsidian gargoyles, a bunch of, uh... magic gremlins.
[108:31.85]This is at least protected.
[108:34.30]This one-way portal is an awful danger.
[108:41.22]Can I close it?
[108:42.84]Can I close this portal?
[108:44.30]This guy... Okay.
[108:47.50]Should I just go fuck this guy up?
[108:55.30]Lots of skeletons.
[108:56.64]Lots of frogs.
[109:05.27]I'm gonna buy a new hero.
[109:07.03]And we're gonna storm the castle and I'm gonna take it back.
[109:12.63]I need somebody in here, though.
[109:17.13]Look at that picture.
[109:18.91]Level 1 knight or level 1 wizard?
[109:22.35]That's the first thing I'm doing.
[109:26.99]Don't go in that portal.
[109:28.17]He's looking at it.
[109:28.87]I can tell.
[109:30.23]Go up there and get your ass kicked.
[109:33.83]Go take that scroll and die.
[109:35.79]Please go up there.
[109:36.79]He doesn't know.
[109:37.27]What's over here?
[109:45.64]I can go over here and go down.
[109:48.74]Let's go to the imp cache.
[109:51.80]This has been... Have I visited this yet?
[109:53.82]I don't think so.
[109:54.48]Don't come in here.
[109:55.80]Don't go in the portal.
[109:59.32]Don't go in the portal.
[110:03.20]Oh!
[110:03.56]Wait!
[110:03.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[110:05.44]Somebody else came!
[110:06.38]Oh, God!
[110:12.15]Purple just came up and just murdered him.
[110:15.09]Go up there and die.
[110:16.87]He's gonna go touch it.
[110:17.78]What do you have?
[110:19.32]He's got, like, treants and griffins and mutants and... Oh, no.
[110:25.36]Okay.
[110:26.56]Take the castle now.
[110:29.19]Take the castle now?
[110:29.91]Alright, here we go.
[110:32.47]Ready?
[110:34.55]Let's get, uh, level 1 genie.
[110:39.27]Oh, yeah!
[110:41.09]Oh, yeah.
[110:41.87]Oh, yeah.
[110:43.01]Oh, yeah.
[110:43.89]Upgrade him.
[110:44.59]We're going to get the castle.
[110:45.41]We're going to just put the walls up.
[110:49.19]Okay, we need to upgrade these guys.
[110:54.22]Oh, Jesus, man.
[110:56.12]64 of them.
[110:57.10]Stone garg upgrade.
[110:58.12]Dude, alright.
[111:05.00]I'm ready.
[111:05.71]Let's go.
[111:06.87]Let's go get the castle while there's nobody in it.
[111:18.25]Nobody in here!
[111:22.49]It's mine!
[111:24.58]Sucker!
[111:26.62]Hey, thanks for the fucking upgrades!
[111:32.58]You dummy!
[111:42.57]You're not going to cut over here.
[111:44.31]Yeah, I don't have any money, but hold on.
[111:46.56]Can I... I'm going to exchange something, because I need money.
[111:50.34]Hold on.
[111:51.94]I got a lot of... Hold on, this is important.
[111:56.34]I need... Castle.
[112:01.66]I need 5,000 gold.
[112:06.72]How do I get 5 grand right now?
[112:09.24]Go to the market.
[112:18.69]I want... I want this.
[112:21.63]What do I get for this?
[112:24.47]Okay, I can do it.
[112:25.21]I can do it.
[112:25.65]I can do it.
[112:26.90]Hold on.
[112:27.24]What's the best one?
[112:27.82]What's the most expensive?
[112:29.82]Gems?
[112:31.48]A hundred.
[112:33.12]Fifty.
[112:33.58]A hundred.
[112:36.00]A hundred.
[112:36.70]They're all a hundred.
[112:38.94]Okay.
[112:39.54]I think I could get rid of some pots.
[112:47.64]Sell the red crayons.
[112:53.68]10... I don't think I need Mercury for anything right now.
[112:58.38]I need to get to 5,000.
[112:58.96]I need wood.
[113:03.54]What about the... Okay, what about sulfur?
[113:08.03]I could do 10 sulfur, 10 pots, 10 ore, which is 3,000.
[113:17.97]I'm going for it, I have to.
[113:21.65]Selective blindness!
[113:24.17]I did it.
[113:25.01]Okay.
[113:26.29]We're gonna do... I don't have enough wood?
[113:36.99]Wait, what do you mean?
[113:42.80]Fuck, I need ten wood.
[113:44.60]Wait, before I... Hold on, before I go any further.
[113:50.85]Hold on, Ned.
[113:51.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:52.01]Important.
[113:53.15]Oh!
[113:56.95]Eat shit game.
[113:57.93]Eat shit game.
[113:58.93]Eat shit game.
[114:00.17]I'm gonna win this.
[114:00.95]I'm gonna hold the castle.
[114:11.92]Alright, what's more important?
[114:14.54]Restore spell points.
[114:17.20]The gems, and can I get the Gem Factory?
[114:20.56]No, not yet.
[114:21.12]I'm gonna go to the Imp Cache.
[114:24.94]You've found an Imp Cache.
[114:26.53]Do you wish to attack the guards?
[114:32.01]The portal near your base is one way.
[114:42.68]They're up.
[114:43.66]Okay, this is a different scenario here.
[114:45.46]Hold on.
[114:46.92]They're just weak.
[114:47.48]It's okay.
[114:49.08]I'm gonna go for... Bottom right.
[114:52.75]Bottom left.
[114:55.75]Yeah, I'll win this.
[114:59.71]It's a lot of imps, but they're not strong enough.
[115:04.31]He's got to go twice.
[115:05.11]That's bullshit.
[115:10.85]No, they ain't gonna win.
[115:13.50]The retaliation alone.
[115:14.30]Alright, let me stay here.
[115:17.92]Magic arrow.
[115:18.56]Let's just try to just melt one of these.
[115:20.24]I'm going to just melt the guy over here.
[115:25.59]Absolutely melt it.
[115:28.49]Okay, just attack the thing right next to you.
[115:30.27]You should kill it.
[115:30.79]Nah, the thing's weak as hell.
[115:34.93]Skeletons go down here.
[115:36.09]I better get something good for this.
[115:44.24]I don't need to waste my magic here.
[115:56.17]We got gargoyles.
[115:57.27]Yeah, same thing down here.
[116:02.49]Skeletons are really good.
[116:03.45]I can't wait to upgrade them.
[116:08.93]Right here.
[116:09.87]I'm going to just move over here.
[116:15.82]Drop them, come on.
[116:21.89]Let's clean this one up.
[116:26.21]Hopefully there's a bunch of money in here, because that was actually to solve every problem I have.
[116:33.77]Let's wrap around.
[116:34.51]Dude, they're doing so good.
[116:39.31]The gremlins are doing really good.
[116:41.79]Alright.
[116:42.09]800 experience.
[116:46.85]200 imps dead.
[116:49.73]Alright.
[116:50.61]Lost some people, but it's okay.
[116:54.77]Alright.
[116:55.89]Level 5 Necromancer.
[116:58.13]Expert eagle eye or basic wisdom.
[117:02.57]I learned attack plus 1.
[117:03.71]That's good.
[117:08.38]60% chance to learn any spell up to 4th level used in combat.
[117:14.03]Or, I can actually learn third level spells.
[117:16.86]That's, yeah, that's better.
[117:19.44]Having defeated the imps, you discover four Mercury and two thousand gold.
[117:25.96]I have done it.
[117:26.80]I've done it.
[117:31.37]Got it.
[117:31.97]I've done it.
[117:34.19]Good.
[117:34.37]I still need wood.
[117:39.65]Is there any wood down here?
[117:43.36]It's like a shipyard.
[117:44.48]There's no wood, though.
[117:48.60]Well, let me just... I can visit this once a day anyway, so I might as well just... I don't think I can do anything else.
[117:55.85]Shrine of Magic Gesture.
[117:56.97]Remove Obstacle.
[117:59.59]I just learned.
[118:02.35]Nice.
[118:02.89]Okay.
[118:04.29]Cool.
[118:05.71]Very cool.
[118:06.13]Very cool.
[118:06.65]Alright.
[118:07.50]But there's lumber here.
[118:08.86]Somebody's right outside the door.
[118:09.76]I gotta remember that.
[118:10.34]It's important to remember.
[118:11.20]Okay, wait, wait.
[118:11.88]Which door?
[118:14.02]So this is a one-way entrance.
[118:15.94]So that person can't even get over here.
[118:19.78]But they can go here.
[118:22.02]So I need to build.
[118:28.21]I need 10 wood.
[118:34.71]I noticed... Yeah, no, I know.
[118:36.29]I read it in the chat a few times.
[118:39.21]No, I knew that like 15, 20 minutes ago.
[118:42.87]I didn't know that before that, but I read.
[118:48.11]I read that.
[118:49.07]I did.
[118:51.35]I'm concerned.
[118:52.99]We both went through it, so no one's... There's nobody gonna live through this.
[119:01.48]This scenario here is... No one is gonna... No one's gonna live through this.
[119:07.04]I have to get on the boat.
[119:09.63]So, it's either take it or don't.
[119:18.30]I need wood.
[119:21.50]I need wood.
[119:23.30]I'm willing to spend.
[119:24.62]What am I willing to spend?
[119:26.94]That's about the best... It's just three.
[119:29.07]I could give some sulfur.
[119:34.73]I need... How much?
[119:39.54]I need ten.
[119:41.34]I could do six sulfur.
[119:42.54]I could do... nine.
[119:50.37]I need one more.
[119:54.71]We could do gems.
[120:00.20]Okay.
[120:03.28]I will now have two arrow towers, fortified defenses, and doubled growth.
[120:19.56]Bring it on.
[120:26.42]Just hang out in here.
[120:27.30]Don't move.
[120:32.15]Save the game.
[120:33.27]That's a good idea.
[120:36.49]Okay.
[120:37.87]I'm fucking nervous, because I can't, like... That's really nice of you to build that for the purple guy just to take it.
[120:47.94]I still have a couple of cities.
[120:49.52]I'm going to piss my pants.
[120:51.26]I'll be right back.
[120:55.52]Two minutes. ...
[121:27.58]Thank you.
[122:38.08]Hey.
[123:13.72]Here we are.
[123:16.48]Alright, so I've got no money.
[123:18.58]I've got defenses.
[123:20.88]I've got a very large amount of people that are going to try to come kill me.
[123:27.75]This does not bode well.
[123:29.21]Okay.
[123:32.23]Let's go.
[123:35.59]There you go, bring it on.
[123:39.80]Or go up top to the spellbook and get killed.
[123:41.62]Here we go.
[123:42.02]Okay.
[123:43.32]160 fucking eight.
[123:44.90]Look at that.
[123:45.32]I got... They shot three times.
[123:46.54]Alright.
[123:46.88]I got an opportunity.
[123:49.02]Here we go.
[123:49.68]Alright.
[123:50.16]Let me think about this for a second.
[123:51.39]I just dropped... All their hobbits are gone immediately.
[123:55.03]Chained lightning.
[123:58.69]Chained lightning.
[124:04.33]Strikes four units.
[124:07.31]Will this bounce around?
[124:12.68]If I do it right here, is this gonna be catastrophic?
[124:18.12]What do I start it on?
[124:25.25]Are we over here?
[124:30.11]Oh, that's not very good.
[124:31.63]Oh, that's not very good.
[124:35.81]Oh, that's not very good!
[124:38.05]Defend.
[124:38.75]I can't do anything with you, unless somebody gets closer.
[124:44.79]Okay.
[124:48.44]I gotta kill these archers, but it's not gonna be good.
[124:58.02]There's so many centaurs.
[125:02.22]I think I have to go for the centaurs.
[125:07.96]No, I gotta go for you.
[125:11.47]The oil could get them.
[125:15.41]That's not a whole lot.
[125:16.79]It's not doing a lot of damage.
[125:19.23]27.
[125:19.95]Fuck.
[125:28.70]Oh!
[125:30.00]Come on, fire it!
[125:31.82]Kill him!
[125:32.68]They're getting in.
[125:35.56]They got in!
[125:36.06]They got in!
[125:36.52]They got in!
[125:37.48]They got in!
[125:38.62]Quick!
[125:39.26]Go this way!
[125:40.38]What do I do?
[125:41.22]She got in!
[125:44.45]Spells!
[125:45.89]Stoneskin!
[125:48.92]Stoneskin!
[125:50.06]Stoneskin!
[125:52.90]Get in there!
[125:55.84]Oh, I'm dead!
[126:00.09]Oh, we're dead.
[126:00.63]This is very bad.
[126:05.93]Seventeen.
[126:09.95]I gotta kill the immediate threat.
[126:13.34]Kill the immediate threat!
[126:15.83]Come on, they can't get in yet!
[126:19.28]15.
[126:20.18]Oh shit, this is so bad.
[126:26.72]I'm dead.
[126:27.84]It's game over.
[126:36.36]That's it.
[126:40.93]They got- they breached.
[126:42.23]The pegasus breached.
[126:43.19]There's not much else I can do.
[126:48.34]I mean, I could dispel.
[126:49.36]No, I don't have any points.
[126:50.54]I don't have any points left.
[126:53.16]We just die.
[126:55.54]Maybe next time.
[126:58.30]It's not over yet, but it will be very soon.
[127:01.47]We just have to try to kill the pegasus.
[127:08.17]My only hope is sincerely that the arches on top will do a lot of damage here.
[127:17.60]Don't surrender.
[127:19.24]Just get up here.
[127:24.00]I got three archers.
[127:25.10]They're going in the mud.
[127:30.39]Come on.
[127:34.17]They only have 12.
[127:39.04]Damn it.
[127:39.86]Not good.
[127:40.26]Now the Rowland is f***ing bad.
[127:45.46]One hit!
[127:46.20]One hit kill!
[127:46.82]149!
[127:46.96]Instantly kill!
[127:49.97]Oh no!
[127:52.59]That's it!
[127:53.53]I got nothing left!
[127:55.59]I got nothing left!
[127:59.39]Oh f***!
[127:59.93]Oh well.
[128:05.64]I tried.
[128:07.14]All I got is you.
[128:12.90]5,000 gold gone.
[128:20.21]It's not over.
[128:21.63]It's not over.
[128:23.23]I still have a... I have a bustling city here.
[128:25.07]It's not over.
[128:31.32]Shit.
[128:33.82]This thing... I just have this for the fucking gold at this point.
[128:37.12]I need a mage tower level 1.
[128:39.82]I need money.
[128:53.76]It's not over.
[128:56.14]It's not over.
[128:58.26]There's still plenty of possibilities.
[129:00.84]I'm going to try to get over here.
[129:09.22]I'm just going to refill my points.
[129:10.42]There's like a pack of dwarves.
[129:12.42]I can get rid of them.
[129:20.63]Would you look at that?
[129:21.37]A group of battle dwarves with a desire for greater glory wish to join you.
[129:24.55]Yes, I accept.
[129:28.86]Well, that, um... That could have just potentially changed everything.
[129:35.34]7, 12, 7, 22 health.
[129:41.60]Shipyard.
[129:42.06]I don't have a fucking boat.
[129:47.97]Alright, things are looking up.
[129:49.41]There's nobody in this area, right?
[129:52.53]Better not be.
[129:53.65]No, it's just me.
[129:57.41]Changed everything again.
[129:59.01]Summon boat?
[129:59.55]That was a different character.
[130:01.68]I don't have that ability.
[130:04.48]Holy fuck, I can summon boat.
[130:06.68]I thought that was a different character.
[130:10.38]It's this guy.
[130:11.38]This is the guy that has the boat ability.
[130:13.88]Alright, I know what I'm doing.
[130:15.58]Here we go.
[130:16.47]Don't kill me.
[130:19.90]There's somebody dangerously close to where I am.
[130:23.22]Alright, get the gold.
[130:26.44]Lots of walking dead.
[130:28.20]And then a golem factory.
[130:35.16]Don't pursue.
[130:36.56]Golem factory.
[130:38.31]Much to your dismay, the golem factory is guarded by a pack of gold golems.
[130:43.45]Do you wish to fight the guards?
[130:47.57]Uh...
[130:50.99]I don't think that's wise.
[130:54.09]That would be very unwise.
[130:55.27]Give me the boat.
[130:56.81]I have 20 points.
[130:58.51]Summon boat.
[131:02.00]God damn it.
[131:02.84]Do it again.
[131:04.24]Summon a boat!
[131:04.88]I got heads twice.
[131:13.67]This strange eye turns and studies you as you approach.
[131:16.13]After a few moments, it returns to its slow scan of the area.
[131:19.51]You can't help but feel like someone or something is using the eye to spy from another location.
[131:29.72]There's a shipwreck survivor right here.
[131:33.34]Come on, I gotta get over here.
[131:34.68]Look at all this.
[131:36.82]There's so much stuff untapped potential over here.
[131:39.18]I need that fucking boat.
[131:43.19]Now!
[131:43.47]Alright, I've got some money.
[131:55.75]Resource silo.
[131:56.91]More gems.
[131:57.41]Increase obsidian and gargoyle production by four.
[132:02.46]Wall of knowledge.
[132:05.90]Let's get it.
[132:06.68]Yeah.
[132:10.36]More growth.
[132:13.33]Better troops.
[132:18.33]Don't kill me, please.
[132:20.33]I give up on this one.
[132:22.55]This one... Alright, you know what?
[132:23.29]This one... How many... How much is it?
[132:24.91]No, not even worth it.
[132:25.59]You can just have them if you take it.
[132:28.51]There's nothing here.
[132:30.48]This place sucks.
[132:37.32]This is the one that I don't care about.
[132:38.64]I already took all this shit, but this is gonna get cleaned.
[132:45.26]This motherfucker's just sailing the seven seas.
[132:50.52]I can't afford a boat.
[132:51.62]How can I not afford a boat?
[132:55.92]I have $9,000.
[132:56.70]Wood?
[132:57.48]Shit.
[133:07.92]But, okay, so, riddle me this.
[133:10.04]Does summon boat...
[133:14.15]Someone's an existing, friendly, unoccupied boat.
[133:18.77]Oh, God damn it.
[133:21.85]I need to have a boat first.
[133:24.69]How much is a boat?
[133:26.37]How much is a boat?
[133:33.04]I need a castle.
[133:33.78]5,010 and 10.
[133:35.06]I'm building a castle.
[133:46.25]I need to get to this capital.
[133:47.23]4,000 gold a day.
[133:48.59]I need to... I just need things.
[133:50.91]Where's the market?
[133:54.51]How much fucking wood do I need?
[134:02.89]It's so much.
[134:03.95]And they're not worth it.
[134:04.63]Ugh.
[134:04.71]I have a terrible exchange rate.
[134:08.63]6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 4...
[134:28.09]I need to... I need to start upgrading.
[134:30.95]Bad.
[134:33.45]Two more.
[134:41.01]Sell some of my Bitcoins?
[134:44.33]I don't... What do you mean?
[134:45.31]They... I don't have any of these.
[134:49.21]Two more wood.
[134:49.95]I'm gonna just take it from here.
[134:50.95]No, I'm not.
[134:53.96]I'm just depleting my resources.
[134:55.56]These are so necessary.
[134:56.88]Alright.
[134:59.82]Castle.
[135:01.82]Adds two arrow towers.
[135:03.68]Fortifies talent defenses.
[135:04.88]Doubles creature growth.
[135:06.20]Build it.
[135:08.06]I can now... $10,000 for a capital building.
[135:15.40]I need a lumber mill.
[135:20.31]I need wood.
[135:21.05]I need a lumber mill.
[135:23.01]This is what... That's it.
[135:25.61]This gives me, like, one wood a day.
[135:31.12]Where is there a lumber mill?
[135:36.04]I need that fucking boat.
[135:39.78]I think I'm gonna go attack this guy.
[135:41.62]Over this guy.
[135:42.36]Lots of gogs.
[135:43.97]Pack of stone golems.
[135:49.11]I'm starting to go in the goblin factory.
[135:51.75]What do you think?
[135:52.11]Should I try to do this?
[135:58.17]Wow, whoever green is, he sucks.
[136:05.45]If I just did the... I don't know how much it is for a boat.
[136:08.87]Is it 10 wood?
[136:18.45]I'm giving myself a restart point.
[136:20.67]Because if this is just horrible, then I'm just restarting the game.
[136:24.75]Go.
[136:27.30]Oh, fuck.
[136:27.96]Okay, so it's... This won't be... I don't think this will be horrible.
[136:41.18]Shield.
[136:42.28]Magic arrow.
[136:44.88]Who's more dangerous here?
[136:49.59]down here.
[136:50.01]I can't reach it though.
[136:57.40]Wait, is magic immune?
[137:02.24]Oh shit!
[137:05.46]They're both magic immune.
[137:07.44]Whatever, it's fine.
[137:11.55]What do I have right now?
[137:12.15]Gargoyle.
[137:13.13]How far can they walk?
[137:17.59]They can walk kind of far.
[137:20.42]I do have the dwarves.
[137:21.10]Alright, dwarves are going in the bottom.
[137:27.05]Not enough.
[137:27.47]Good.
[137:28.21]Okay.
[137:29.39]I have no range.
[137:30.13]I have you, though.
[137:32.31]Uh, you defend.
[137:33.93]You also defend.
[137:35.03]No, go up, like, a little bit.
[137:39.15]You go down here to back up the dwarves.
[137:40.55]Nice shot.
[137:42.65]Alright.
[137:44.19]Gargoyle time.
[137:47.18]Stay here.
[137:49.82]Nice.
[137:50.30]Okay.
[137:50.86]Dwarves.
[137:52.82]This is where you wanted to join a better cause.
[138:01.70]Pretty good tank.
[138:03.22]Stay with it.
[138:13.87]No.
[138:15.27]No!
[138:35.70]Good.
[138:36.44]Just... I gotta go for it.
[138:39.78]Five.
[138:43.91]Go for the one that's damaged.
[138:50.63]Get the skeletons down here.
[138:51.75]There's 50 of these guys.
[138:59.08]You're next in line.
[139:01.70]In fact, you wrap around here.
[139:05.42]Four left.
[139:06.00]Oh, there they go.
[139:07.62]There they go.
[139:09.06]There they go.
[139:12.49]They fought for glory.
[139:15.09]Bring in the skeletons.
[139:16.89]49 versus 4.
[139:19.55]Big damage here.
[139:22.07]Very good.
[139:23.52]And I mean very good.
[139:32.83]Nice.
[139:33.95]You're just trying to take a plate of space at this point.
[139:36.17]Gargoyles are dead here.
[139:41.90]Good.
[139:42.60]That's what I wanted you to do.
[139:45.02]Alright.
[139:47.08]Bring in the gremlins.
[139:48.54]From top left.
[139:52.78]Kill this.
[139:55.66]Done.
[139:56.22]Alright.
[139:57.68]It's almost impossible for me to lose this.
[139:59.10]This better be worth it.
[140:04.52]Surrounded by all sides.
[140:07.66]Six.
[140:08.86]Oh, this way.
[140:12.93]49 skeletons.
[140:17.77]This thing is so strong.
[140:18.99]Imagine having, like, more than 20 of these.
[140:21.37]It'd be unbeatable.
[140:31.11]Almost... Gremlins are almost dead.
[140:33.95]Thank God.
[140:34.51]810 experience.
[140:41.73]The Golem Factory is now no longer defended.
[140:45.24]Oh.
[140:46.18]Oh.
[140:47.30]My God.
[140:47.90]Okay.
[140:51.40]How much money do I have?
[140:53.14]Fruit Iron Golem.
[140:54.84]I can bring in a bunch.
[140:57.96]Bring them all in!
[141:00.40]How much can I have?
[141:02.51]This is diamond golems.
[141:04.19]I definitely want at least two of these.
[141:09.13]Diamond gold golems.
[141:12.63]Okay, I got one more slot.
[141:16.32]No, actually I don't.
[141:17.40]Because these are stone.
[141:21.02]I can get them all.
[141:25.24]Okay, I can fill it up.
[141:30.54]That's good.
[141:31.90]Two diamond, three gold, seven stone now.
[141:36.25]I spent all my money, that's okay.
[141:45.81]These guys are so tough.
[141:53.88]Now, I can go up here and get this now.
[141:55.72]For sure.
[141:56.42]Guaranteed.
[142:01.27]Now it's time to save for a boat.
[142:04.37]And hope I don't get attacked.
[142:07.21]I don't like where that guy's going.
[142:08.23]I don't like the boats that you're on.
[142:13.39]Well, I don't have those.
[142:14.45]Lots of people to recruit.
[142:15.29]But I don't have the money.
[142:30.80]I could get another hero.
[142:31.70]No, don't do that.
[142:33.95]I need money.
[142:34.87]I need wood.
[142:38.31]Save the game.
[142:42.28]Looks good so far.
[142:45.18]Lots of wraiths.
[142:45.90]I have a great team here.
[143:02.49]I mean, I'm going hard.
[143:10.09]Let's go.
[143:18.54]Oh, fuck you.
[143:21.34]Fucking goddamn taxes again.
[143:23.36]I'm broke still.
[143:27.48]Go on, come on over here.
[143:35.18]You ain't got nothing.
[143:40.05]I don't think you can make it.
[143:40.83]I'm going to defend.
[143:41.97]I'm going to defend.
[143:44.07]I'm going to actually defend with most everybody.
[143:47.15]Let's put you guys out there.
[143:48.25]Put the skeletons out here, too.
[143:51.23]Yeah, because I don't want to lose any of these guys.
[143:55.60]I want them to be incredibly safe.
[144:06.95]Drains enemy mana.
[144:11.29]Let's see if I can do something here.
[144:12.41]It'll be slow.
[144:12.99]Let's see if this works.
[144:17.23]Not bad.
[144:19.22]Defend.
[144:19.70]I don't want them going out there.
[144:20.66]That's okay.
[144:27.44]This is pretty good so far.
[144:28.60]Alright.
[144:29.12]We've got Diamond.
[144:31.90]Diamond, go.
[144:33.01]This might be a one-hit kill.
[144:38.21]Not really, but it was still pretty good.
[144:44.88]Yeah, I have just these slow-moving assholes.
[144:47.38]The skeletons are the best.
[144:48.62]They just truly are.
[144:49.76]Look at this.
[144:51.34]They're so good.
[144:54.88]Don't hit the diamond.
[144:56.04]Thank you.
[145:00.15]Okay.
[145:02.21]Only lost a few skeletons.
[145:04.97]Here we go.
[145:07.25]Knowledge plus one.
[145:08.69]Basic resistance.
[145:09.58]Basic resistance endows a hero's troops with 5% magic resistance.
[145:14.26]Yeah.
[145:15.08]Take it.
[145:15.36]Here we go.
[145:17.70]And now I get some good... What is this?
[145:20.28]One a day.
[145:20.78]Well, I could probably do this now.
[145:34.06]Hold on, let me get the points.
[145:36.40]That's 30.
[145:37.40]Alright, how are we doing with that?
[145:41.02]Oh, the taxes took all my money.
[145:42.72]So, I can't do anything.
[145:50.06]Okay, what do we got?
[145:51.20]I already did this.
[145:51.99]I already did the imp cash.
[145:54.19]I got 3,500.
[145:54.77]We're gonna go up.
[145:59.73]To... Is the War Machine Factory the... Harpies!
[146:04.22]I think I can take them.
[146:15.75]Or the sent... no.
[146:19.75]Let me take a look at the map, because I need to start to move out somewhere.
[146:22.30]I own that stuff.
[146:28.07]I really just... I need... What about up here?
[146:30.42]Pack of stone golems.
[146:31.44]Okay, I can do this.
[146:32.76]I can get up here.
[146:34.26]We can get the... this stuff here.
[146:36.90]Yeah, move up here.
[146:42.69]Uh, this is the good old games version.
[146:44.13]This is not the HD remaster.
[146:47.21]This is the good old games version with the community HD patch.
[146:55.27]I need 10,000 gold to do that.
[146:56.65]I don't have that yet, unfortunately.
[146:58.93]Look at all that stuff he's getting.
[147:03.93]I need to get out there.
[147:06.85]Alright, I was at the tomb.
[147:12.68]Did not go to the windmill yet.
[147:13.72]I'll take the three.
[147:18.34]This is the rally flag.
[147:20.34]I can grab this.
[147:22.56]Luck and morale up.
[147:26.02]Might as well just touch it.
[147:27.74]Okay, I'm ready.
[147:29.16]Pack of golems.
[147:31.38]I have a pack of golems, too.
[147:34.70]Let's go.
[147:35.04]They're just clearing all the... I'm dead.
[147:42.95]Pack of stone golems.
[147:44.95]Nine and nine.
[147:54.91]I'm gonna win.
[147:59.35]I'm gonna keep the skeletons back.
[148:01.87]Like here.
[148:11.88]I really want to just have... I want to attack first, so... Defend.
[148:17.26]Everybody defend.
[148:18.86]Yeah, I don't want to be the one that gets hit.
[148:22.12]Let them come to us.
[148:25.48]Like that.
[148:28.06]Alright.
[148:29.70]You are going to go... Let's just overwhelm this one.
[148:32.92]Overwhelm this guy with everybody.
[148:35.20]He's running away.
[148:39.14]He's going down here.
[148:42.46]Overwhelm.
[148:48.08]You stay back.
[148:48.64]Uh-oh.
[148:51.90]Not good.
[148:52.92]We've got to get up there.
[148:59.44]Oh, fuck.
[149:00.74]You go up there.
[149:05.24]Luck.
[149:15.23]Get rid of this one.
[149:17.35]Three versus... There we go.
[149:18.93]We should do it.
[149:21.31]One more.
[149:24.37]Fuck.
[149:25.03]He's come off my skeletons.
[149:26.11]I know he is.
[149:33.87]Why am I holding back the skeletons?
[149:35.07]Because I can... If I... If I don't lose any skeletons, I can have, like, a hundred of them.
[149:41.95]Remember, any time one point is ticked off, there's a chance that it adds to my skeleton stack.
[149:48.31]So, I mean, I'm just... I'm going, like, skeletons.
[149:51.11]Uh, we're good.
[149:59.19]Actually, probably good to get... No.
[150:00.91]Not worth it.
[150:04.82]So I have 49 now.
[150:05.66]I only lost three people.
[150:07.86]I should maybe have some more.
[150:09.64]Let's see what I've got now.
[150:12.42]53 skeletons now.
[150:15.82]Alchemist's Lab.
[150:16.54]I've already visited this.
[150:22.03]Bingo.
[150:22.67]I now have one of those a day.
[150:24.03]And then there's something.
[150:24.67]Artifact.
[150:27.25]What is it?
[150:27.63]Gog.
[150:27.99]Gog.
[150:32.01]Got some gremlins.
[150:34.89]Is a gog scary?
[150:39.05]I don't know if I can fight this.
[150:40.31]I don't know what a gog is.
[150:49.61]They're ranged.
[150:51.48]Lots of gogs.
[150:55.02]Alright, what can I do?
[150:57.34]Resource silo.
[150:59.58]Lookout tower.
[151:02.38]Altar of Wishes.
[151:03.93]Genies.
[151:07.11]Genies or Capital Building?
[151:10.95]Genies.
[151:14.65]Okay, Capital.
[151:19.60]I'll have a decent amount to recruit after this.
[151:22.80]I don't want to waste money here.
[151:25.06]Get one city ready to go.
[151:35.82]Mmm, he's coming.
[151:36.56]No!
[151:39.72]This guy's clear.
[151:41.82]That orange is clearing out.
[151:43.04]Oh, fuck.
[151:44.20]He got in a boat.
[151:45.38]He got in a boat.
[151:45.92]This guy got in a boat.
[151:47.96]Where's he going?
[151:48.48]He could go down here and then... Oh, no.
[151:52.84]He's in a boat.
[151:54.06]He finally got one.
[151:56.96]He's gonna go down and he's gonna come over here and he's gonna meet me over here.
[152:00.11]I'm fucked.
[152:03.97]Okay.
[152:07.66]I gotta be ready for this.
[152:11.54]Is it worth trying to get this artifact?
[152:20.51]I have some decent army.
[152:24.57]Let's go.
[152:26.03]This is not bad.
[152:26.43]There's only 11 of them.
[152:34.11]Yeah, they're weak.
[152:35.25]Get up there.

[153:24.90]Almost a one-hit kill.
[153:25.72]Good job.
[153:32.43]You can just sit here.
[153:34.21]Nice.
[153:35.85]Lost a couple of skeletons, but that's alright.
[153:40.61]There it is.
[153:40.97]Cape of Velocity.
[153:46.17]What does it do?
[153:50.45]I mean, it's alright.
[154:01.46]That's okay.
[154:02.44]That's pretty good.
[154:05.80]I can move more.
[154:06.62]That's good.
[154:07.16]Backpack.
[154:07.62]I don't have anything in the backpack.
[154:09.76]Nothing else up here.
[154:10.58]I'm delaying the inevitable.
[154:25.25]Here we go.
[154:26.53]Crystal Kingdom to 4000 gold a day.
[154:30.23]It's done.
[154:36.64]Now I need to upgrade.
[154:37.84]This has already been done.
[154:42.10]This has already been done.
[154:44.14]I need to do the Golem Factory.
[154:48.32]Do that another time.
[154:49.14]Speaking of Golem Factories...
[154:53.37]I wanna... go back to the Golem Factory.
[154:57.37]And hopefully I'll have ten by then.
[155:04.80]I'll have ten by then.
[155:07.16]Because I'm scared of the guy on the damn boat.
[155:11.20]I don't know where he's gonna go.
[155:12.10]It's so scary.
[155:25.00]Alright.
[155:29.15]Someone's gonna be waiting for me down here.
[155:30.53]This is so close.
[155:33.01]Look at how close he is.
[155:33.95]He's in the boat right there.
[155:34.87]Ugh, 10.
[155:37.53]I have 10.
[155:37.89]I'm not gonna be able to make it.
[155:45.29]Not even close.
[155:50.26]Castle, Tavern, Wall of Nod, Lookout Tower, Resource Silo.
[155:55.46]One gem.
[155:56.80]Golden Pavilion.
[155:59.74]Or the genies.
[156:00.48]Genies or the Nagas.
[156:04.14]Probably Nagas.
[156:05.94]They're the ultimate unit.
[156:07.19]No, no, no.
[156:07.67]Giants are the ultimate unit.
[156:14.99]We'll go genie.
[156:18.01]Okay, genie now available.
[156:25.18]13 to 16 damage, that's pretty good.
[156:30.62]They're available.
[156:33.12]I've got 10 wood.
[156:36.07]Don't worry, I know I just spent 5, but trust me, it's going to take me at least 4 or 5 days to even get down here.
[156:40.75]We've got a new week.
[156:47.13]We'll have a ton of people.
[156:56.88]Alright, I'm ready.
[156:59.70]Here we go.
[157:06.64]He's going down to the islands.
[157:07.60]Fuck, he's gonna get all this shit before I am!
[157:11.77]All dwellings increase population again.
[157:16.03]Come on, get me to the boat!
[157:17.33]I'm so close!
[157:25.41]What do I got?
[157:26.29]I have so many people to recruit.
[157:27.61]How much is it?
[157:30.17]95, 80.
[157:30.21]I have so many recruits.
[157:35.49]Save the money.
[157:36.05]I'm gonna just get barely down here.
[157:42.85]This guy's gonna take all the cool shit.
[157:51.60]Let's go.
[157:56.27]That's all I can do.
[157:57.01]Just don't go to this cool island.
[157:58.54]I want to go to the island.
[158:02.96]He's on the island.
[158:05.14]Oh, he's on the island right now.
[158:08.02]They're scooping up fucking taxes.
[158:10.94]Wow, why?
[158:12.24]What the fuck?
[158:14.12]What?
[158:14.68]They took all my wood.
[158:15.80]I had to...
[158:31.67]You took all my wood.
[158:32.91]God damn it.
[158:39.55]I'm so disappointed right now.
[158:41.19]I... I gotta go for it.
[158:46.47]I have to.
[158:46.81]I have to.
[159:02.41]This is too much money.
[159:05.79]Not using gold.
[159:06.71]Yeah, but this is every cent I have.
[159:08.81]Just to get seven?
[159:09.95]I can get one, two, three.
[159:55.72]Give me the boat now.
[159:57.24]Boat, please.
[160:01.26]That's it.
[160:01.90]It was only a thousand.
[160:04.18]Give me a boat.
[160:05.58]Get in the boat.
[160:06.81]We're in a boat.
[160:07.65]Boys and girls, we've made it.
[160:08.65]We're gonna go rescue this person.

[162:33.02]Oh, so you're going to go in that?
[162:34.12]There's a bunch of orcs in there.
[162:38.77]You're dead.
[162:46.91]Bye.
[162:48.54]The mistake was taking this.
[162:49.74]Do you see how many times this castle has changed hands?
[162:53.43]Like five times at least.
[162:56.01]This is just a dead zone here.
[163:03.71]I will kill you.
[163:10.15]You have one person?
[163:14.91]This must- I mean, this is a scout.
[163:18.00]This is just a scout, yeah?
[163:28.97]You've captured an enemy artifact!
[163:30.81]Endless bag of gold and bow of elven cherry wood!
[163:38.49]It took fucking deadly 15 grand!
[163:43.85]When equipped, the endless bag of gold increases your income by 750 a day.
[163:47.56]This bow increases your archery by 5%.
[163:54.18]What a mistake that was.
[163:55.42]That guy is fucking dead.
[163:57.99]Alright, I don't know if I want to attack this yet.
[164:00.71]And I got a boat too.
[164:03.31]So I got money.
[164:05.01]Very important.
[164:05.65]Let me take this place over.
[164:10.96]This pla- Wait, what's in here?
[164:12.74]Oh boy.
[164:15.58]He's on his way over here.
[164:25.94]This guy's dangerous.
[164:29.47]Look at this shit.
[164:30.15]There's stuff back here.
[164:31.19]Red border gate.
[164:35.43]There's like a troll bridge.
[164:38.63]I probably need to just get on the boat and get out of here.
[164:50.70]Let me just go to the arena.
[164:52.68]There's nothing else down here.
[164:53.76]I'm not going to go in here.
[164:54.58]Then go.
[164:58.10]That's two attack.
[165:00.53]I think I need defense.
[165:01.67]I have zero defense, guys.
[165:08.75]This is very necessary.
[165:09.67]Give me the shipyard.
[165:11.25]How many...
[165:14.72]mine he's not going to be able to move he's going to anchor up here and he's going to be stuck so I got an opportunity I can leave why did I do that because he can't move when he went I'm getting in there and I'm getting the gold
[165:41.53]Okay, Artifacts, Merchants.
[165:42.85]For a nominal fee, you can purchase Artifacts from the Merchants.
[165:46.81]Lookout Tower.
[165:49.63]Super Genies?
[165:51.49]Yeah.
[165:52.83]Upgraded Genies.
[165:55.72]Master Genie.
[165:56.80]Recruit Genies.
[165:57.56]What's the difference?
[165:58.54]Hates.
[165:59.56]Efreet.
[166:01.40]Spellcaster.
[166:02.18]Random Benefit.
[166:02.86]That's pretty good.
[166:09.51]This is still uncontested somehow.
[166:14.01]Alright.
[166:15.73]He's not gonna have enough points to do anything.
[166:20.75]Here he comes in the boat again.
[166:21.93]He's going around.
[166:23.07]See?
[166:25.18]He might take this castle, but... Okay, do I have enough?
[166:31.84]He's not coming for me, I don't think.
[166:37.78]I think I can get in there and get out.
[166:39.72]Where's my... Where's the boat?
[166:43.27]Whatever the boat that was right here.
[166:45.13]I can get in and get out.
[166:50.60]He summoned the boat.
[166:51.56]Oh, fuck.
[166:54.22]No, I know my boat's right here, but he must have summoned it back.
[167:04.15]Summon it?
[167:04.63]Should I summon it from him?
[167:05.85]No, but I can get in this one.
[167:07.37]I'm going for it.
[167:07.85]Fuck it.
[167:12.60]I can't let you pass.
[167:13.56]You should seek a Keymaster tent.
[167:15.78]Like that?
[167:17.30]What about the Troll Bridge?
[167:22.72]Much to your dismay, the Troll Bridge is guarded by several trolls.
[167:25.06]Do you want to fight?
[167:26.79]No.
[167:28.23]No, go back to my, like, war machine factory.
[167:30.31]I'm going to recruit more golems.
[167:36.31]No, I am not going for it.
[167:42.90]Alright, it's time to get another hero.
[167:46.58]Wizard or Necromancer.
[167:48.54]I kind of want like a knight.
[167:51.64]Specially hypnotize.
[167:52.98]Animate dead.
[167:55.06]Just have two Necromancers?
[167:58.65]Yeah.
[168:02.05]Level 3.
[168:05.19]Wait, who the fuck is this person?
[168:10.15]Wait, Thant?
[168:13.74]Wasn't this guy an enemy?
[168:14.78]Oh, he's a deserter!
[168:17.10]He deserted!
[168:18.06]That's so funny.
[168:23.32]He deserted and we hired him.
[168:25.84]No loyalty at all, holy shit.
[168:27.74]Alright, do you think I should just deck him out?
[168:33.17]With all my money?
[168:35.09]Fuck yeah.
[168:36.49]I'm gonna spend every step- The golems, fuck.
[168:42.08]He's pretty fucking strong, though, alright?
[168:44.16]Like, we can't just have one hero.
[168:46.88]This guy has a lot.
[168:47.86]The Master Genies.
[168:49.64]These are really good.
[168:50.56]I'm okay with this.
[168:58.96]No, where's, uh, where's he?
[169:00.02]Here.
[169:04.97]He's got the Glyph of Gallantry.
[169:07.31]Moral by one.
[169:08.75]He has the first aid tent.
[169:11.60]Heals everybody in each round.
[169:13.44]Okay.
[169:13.62]What does he have for spells?
[169:15.66]Summon boat.
[169:16.44]Great.
[169:19.62]Animate dead.
[169:21.68]Increased effect of animate dead.
[169:27.57]Okay.
[169:28.85]I'm gonna keep him here for now.
[169:34.01]Let's move on.
[169:40.80]I need to go check out the golems.
[169:43.66]Oh, there he is.
[169:46.20]Did he fight?
[169:47.24]Okay, he had to fight.
[169:48.02]This is empty.
[169:52.36]No, I'm not doing that again.
[169:55.34]He's getting so much more money, though.
[170:00.71]I'm not going to fall for it.
[170:01.57]I did the same thing to this guy.
[170:04.11]Let him take on the trolls.
[170:05.61]Let him fight everything, and then I'm going to clean him up.
[170:12.31]Oh!

[170:27.41]There's a bunch of stuff down here.
[170:28.67]Dwarven Treasury.
[170:34.03]Anchor up first.

[171:21.51]Hopefully the person doesn't fall.
[171:22.82]Go fight the trolls in the bridge.
[171:27.94]No.
[171:29.67]All dwellings increase population.
[171:30.87]Weak of the Condor.
[171:33.17]5,000.

[172:20.01]Farm golems for 10 straight turns.
[172:22.13]I feel like I'm gonna lose something.
[172:29.32]War taxes.
[172:34.36]Nah, it's per week.
[172:36.78]It's not every day, it's every week.
[172:40.11]Sorry.
[172:40.87]Unfortunately, guys.
[172:43.01]I'm gonna go exploring.
[172:43.71]I'm gonna go down here.

[173:09.74]I can make it fully upgraded.
[173:14.02]I just can't afford it right this second.
[173:17.97]Let's go.
[173:25.59]He's gonna be right in my way.
[173:30.19]Uncharted territory.
[173:31.26]Hold on a minute here.

[173:57.49]Get on over there.
[174:03.86]Walk the plank.
[174:04.42]They're gonna have to do the same thing.
[174:21.41]Ow.
[174:24.13]He ran away?
[174:26.71]He wasn't gonna deal with that?
[174:27.67]He abandoned his post.
[174:30.94]Goodbye.
[174:34.68]Cowards.
[174:38.14]Fucking coward.
[174:41.06]So what is over here?
[174:43.97]A lot of uncharted territory.
[174:45.45]What about up there?
[174:46.07]Should I check this?
[174:47.81]Oh, there's a shipwreck.
[174:49.47]Let's check it.
[174:55.06]Resource silo.
[174:57.90]Let's upgrade some stuff.
[175:02.94]This is the best scene that I can make.
[175:09.40]I'm bringing in so many people.
[175:10.64]I'm just spending so much money.
[175:13.22]I've got so many people.
[175:15.49]I'm going to win.
[175:18.49]The turtle wins the race.
[175:20.87]Did you see the end of that movie?
[175:22.17]The rotting hulk of a great pirate ship creaks eerily as it is pushed against the rocks.
[175:37.29]Do you wish to search the shipwreck?
[175:39.63]Yes.
[175:39.87]Fucking morale down.
[175:45.23]Search it, yeah.
[175:48.67]Nothing in there?
[175:49.27]Whoa.
[175:49.61]Okay.
[175:49.91]I'm gonna be unstoppable.
[176:15.19]Uh-oh.
[176:16.33]Red.
[176:17.96]I haven't seen red or blue.
[176:22.02]Mermaids.
[176:28.10]Luck.
[176:29.10]Increased luck.
[176:35.72]Anything else?
[176:41.70]Ooh.
[176:43.58]Ooh, turn around.
[176:46.66]I got too greedy.
[176:47.58]I thought there was shit over here.
[176:59.41]Should I board him?
[176:59.97]Let's see what he does.
[177:03.79]I think red is the actually one to be afraid of.
[177:14.54]No, this is very heavily guarded right now.
[177:20.86]I'm going down here.
[177:27.34]Do I have everything that I can?
[177:35.12]99, 66, 39, 23, 24, 15, 6.
[177:39.12]Unstoppable.
[177:43.64]Could I have another hero, too?
[177:44.82]Yeah, I could have another hero.
[177:47.45]Maybe I'm absolutely going to pick this weird frog guy.
[178:01.03]Alright, who am I going to give you?
[178:01.87]You're going to go off on your own adventure.
[178:06.59]You don't get anybody.
[178:13.41]Have this one person farm golems.
[178:14.81]That would be useful.
[178:16.14]Alright, you go off on an adventure.
[178:21.86]In fact...
[178:24.49]No, I can't fit them both in the boat.
[178:30.17]You gotta make your way over here.
[178:35.55]We need like two boats.
[178:38.22]Head down here.
[178:38.72]Okay.
[178:51.15]Let's move on.
[178:56.91]That's where I'm going.
[179:02.02]Is Blue just hanging out right there?
[179:03.20]Can I see what he has?
[179:05.70]Freelancer's Guild.
[179:06.70]I feel like there's something good there.
[179:07.66]Let's land.
[179:16.00]Lot of shit over here.
[179:19.58]Can't go anywhere.

[179:39.28]Should this be the Stax Defender?
[179:47.67]Level 1 Alchemist or Edelmon, the burning guy.
[179:56.85]Specialty golems?
[179:59.04]Specialty golems!
[180:35.79]Should she just take the golems?
[180:36.97]Just take them all?
[180:38.79]I mean, she is the golem queen.
[180:44.98]Alright, you take the golems.
[180:48.46]Have fun.
[180:48.80]Alright, let's go!

[181:01.35]Witch Hut.
[181:05.41]Basic Offense.
[181:07.03]What does the specialty do?
[181:07.99]Increases the attack and defense skills of any stone or iron golems for each level attained after third level.
[181:16.17]Xeno.
[181:18.69]As a frog guy, you're kind of useless at this point.
[181:24.23]Anything else to upgrade?
[181:26.17]Golem Factory.
[181:29.84]Probably should just... I probably should have done that before.
[181:33.29]Send her back.
[181:34.75]Waste of a turn, but whatever.
[181:35.71]Oh yeah, I'll put Frog Eye in a boat.
[181:42.67]Send him somewhere.
[181:43.37]Alright, we'll do that after.
[181:45.69]Go back.
[181:46.95]Upgrade these guys.
[181:47.69]41 Iron Golems.
[181:56.87]And let's buy as many people as we can.
[181:59.33]I can only... These are so good.
[182:03.62]Alright, I got enough golems.
[182:04.92]No, just... Alright, we're gonna go.
[182:06.26]I got 41 iron golems.
[182:16.80]Here we go.
[182:18.08]Time to start with you.
[182:22.23]We've got the shipyard.
[182:24.29]I mean, do I should I just buy it, own it?
[182:26.30]Does it really matter?
[182:27.64]We've got Freelancer's Guild.
[182:35.92]Please inspect our fine wares.
[182:37.28]If you feel like offering a trade, click on the items you wish to trade for.
[182:44.87]Oh, I see.
[182:46.37]I can give you two iron golems for one wood.
[182:49.67]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[182:51.39]No thanks.
[182:56.13]Shrine.
[182:56.61]Learn third level spell.
[182:59.11]Frost Ring.
[183:02.10]Lots of beholders.
[183:05.52]It's a gold mine.
[183:09.06]Think I could take him.
[183:13.92]We got, uh, Idle Fortune.
[183:15.16]Let's get it.
[183:15.58]Okay, what about you?
[183:19.38]I want to get you shipping out here.
[183:20.88]I can't buy a boat, but I will next turn.
[183:25.58]Out of money.
[183:26.04]Let's go.
[183:28.27]He comes to attack, of course.
[183:35.03]Frost Ring.
[183:39.57]Magic Arrow is 50 points.
[183:53.63]There's a lot of them, but are they magic resistant?
[183:59.23]No.
[184:07.15]Not bad.
[184:07.47]We can take them.
[184:23.14]Oof, that hurt.
[184:28.72]Eeeek.
[184:34.65]Get in there.
[184:35.21]Yeah, we got this.
[184:41.93]Spread them out a little bit.
[184:43.97]We go forward here.
[184:47.71]Yeah, we're good.
[184:50.95]I should meet that lady somewhere in the middle and transfer the golems to her.
[185:09.36]Although, there's no bonus for these golems, unfortunately, right?
[185:17.09]Let's go... you.
[185:23.85]There you go.
[185:24.95]Up this way.
[185:27.39]One last gremlin remains.
[185:29.25]I think that gremlin's gonna stay alive.
[185:31.77]There we go.
[185:42.71]These things are... We're gonna lose our skeleton stack, I think.
[185:53.14]Although we should get some more.
[185:58.92]Lost 29 skeletons.
[186:01.25]Ton of experience though.
[186:03.31]Ooh.
[186:09.05]Fourth level spells, basic Earth magic.
[186:11.47]I need to go and learn some spells.
[186:21.35]Four gems.
[186:22.68]One a day.
[186:23.26]Good.
[186:24.98]Alright, let's go this way.
[186:27.16]Thousand experience.
[186:30.24]Oh, fuck.
[186:32.28]This is this guy's capital.
[186:35.67]Purple?
[186:38.17]Not strong enough to take that yet.
[186:48.54]Alright, Golem Lady needs to go down to Golem Center.
[186:55.43]Right here.
[186:56.75]We need to get wood.
[186:57.65]We need boats.
[186:58.81]I need a ton of shit.
[187:04.53]Yeah, the second city.
[187:05.48]I mean, no one's coming near this.
[187:08.78]This has been untouched.
[187:11.66]Maybe it's time to put some resources into this and actually make it.
[187:14.20]But I don't have any money.
[187:14.92]I don't have any resources.
[187:15.66]I need wood.
[187:18.35]Can't do anything with it right now.
[187:20.31]You cannot get a boat, so I can't do anything with you.
[187:24.41]You may as well just sit here.
[187:25.59]Alright.
[187:36.42]Gold Mine.
[187:37.82]Den of Thieves.
[187:39.70]Which I'm actually interested in right now.
[187:42.53]Here we go.
[187:43.91]Best Hero.
[187:47.94]Number of towns.
[187:53.58]Red.
[187:54.40]So red is... Oh, Jesus.
[187:56.84]Wyverns.
[187:59.24]Everybody has something really strong.
[188:06.60]I'm terrible on defense, but I'm powerful on everything else.
[188:12.19]This dude has a legit red dragon.
[188:17.09]Look at that face.
[188:19.48]I have the best income.
[188:22.78]Mm-hmm.
[188:29.46]Good to know.
[188:32.51]Alright.
[188:33.23]Homestead.
[188:34.11]Purple.
[188:34.45]Let's take all this shit away from purple.
[188:38.41]Do it next turn.
[188:39.93]Don't have enough for both.
[188:42.41]So you two just gonna have to sit here.
[188:48.57]Let's go back this way.
[188:54.49]Lookout tower.
[188:55.85]Wall of knowledge.
[188:58.99]This cloud temple.
[189:03.21]I need to... It's just... My resources have been so depleted.
[189:12.24]I'm just going to have to keep going.
[189:19.06]What is this on?
[189:19.54]This is just on PC.
[189:21.52]It's on Windows 10.
[189:22.78]Good old games, it works perfectly fine.
[189:24.46]There is an HD patch.
[189:25.48]You don't have to get the HD remaster.
[189:27.06]The HD remaster on Steam... is... unfortunately, I guess, doesn't have any of the expansion packs, doesn't have any added content.
[189:36.37]That's a thousand gold a day.
[189:39.29]Medusa Stores.
[189:44.51]Homestead?
[189:49.65]Recruit wood elves.
[189:52.21]Yeah.
[189:54.17]Medusa stores?
[190:01.52]This is probably... Medusas?
[190:09.34]I don't have enough... Dammit.
[190:13.11]Alright.
[190:15.01]It might be time to upgrade this other town.
[190:18.97]What are we going to get here?
[190:19.99]Tavern.
[190:22.64]For a fort.
[190:24.60]City hall.
[190:25.40]I need tavern and a mage guild.
[190:27.00]Taverns.
[190:28.22]No, that's wood.
[190:30.40]Resource silo.
[190:31.52]Mage.
[190:32.14]It's all wood.
[190:32.67]I need the wood.
[190:38.17]No, not until I get a boat.
[190:42.85]Although, I might as well just...
[190:46.96]I'll take 85 of these.
[190:49.32]Why not?
[190:49.60]At least there's somebody there.
[190:53.28]Resource silo is 5... 5,000.
[190:57.34]What do I have?
[191:00.08]I have plenty.
[191:00.96]Yeah, let's build a resource silo.
[191:02.70]I can do it on both.
[191:04.66]Resource silo.
[191:05.54]5,005.
[191:06.46]Do it again.
[191:07.16]That's plus 2 gems a day.
[191:15.81]Just waiting for the goddamn wood.
[191:18.48]So I can get this person in a boat and send him.
[191:25.02]How much are you?
[191:28.08]Not quite enough to... I can get these.
[191:31.75]Alright, let's go.
[191:43.17]I'm about to be at the stage where I'm gonna... Uh-oh.
[191:45.49]Oh, fuck.
[191:45.95]That guy just landed.
[191:50.80]Oh.
[191:51.54]Uh-oh.
[191:51.78]Uh-oh.
[191:53.00]Uh-oh.
[191:53.44]Uh-oh.
[191:53.82]Uh-oh.
[191:54.04]Uh-oh.
[191:56.34]Uh-oh.
[191:58.52]Not my two scouts.
[192:00.84]Nine.
[192:02.72]Boat.
[192:03.75]Give me his boat.
[192:08.37]See you later, motherfucker.
[192:17.11]Alright, I mean, I've got... I've got 47 Iron Golems.
[192:27.65]I've gotta get out of here with this lady.
[192:36.34]Stalem?
[192:41.76]He has a horde, horde, horde.
[192:43.84]He has, like, hundreds of people.
[192:46.35]bodyblock him?
[192:48.19]I can't bodyblock him!
[192:51.89]It's alright, we still have, uh, Professor Thant.
[192:59.64]Guys, no one's taken this castle.
[193:02.92]Not with Professor Thant.
[193:07.97]Okay, what's the Medusa stories?
[193:09.79]What happened?
[193:13.52]Oh.
[193:15.00]Somebody already took it.
[193:15.78]I got scared for a second.
[193:16.64]Alright, let's go this way.
[193:17.70]The windmill.
[193:19.13]Already visited that.
[193:19.85]Already went to the dead thieves.
[193:21.93]Let's go.
[193:23.67]To the Dwarven Treasury.
[193:27.01]We found a Dwarven Treasury.
[193:28.21]Do you wish to attack the guards?
[193:47.01]What?
[193:47.33]What?
[193:47.91]What'd I just do?
[193:51.99]20% magic resist.
[193:52.79]I have an 80% chance to hit you with that.
[193:58.25]That was bullshit.
[194:01.41]It's alright.
[194:07.80]You take this one on.
[194:11.48]Good.
[194:11.96]Look at that.
[194:12.36]That's a ton of damage.
[194:14.66]Uh, I think I'm just gonna split up into the four corners.
[194:22.79]I'll take the skeletons up here.
[194:27.71]Alright, you... both of you guys kill this one.
[194:38.88]Yeah, you're getting counter-attacked every five seconds.
[194:45.73]Yeah, you're trying to run away.
[194:50.54]Who do I want to shoot at?
[194:52.20]Probably... Probably you.
[194:59.63]And then you go up and help the skeletons.
[195:03.97]I don't care about this guy.
[195:04.79]He's going to die.
[195:09.71]There you go.
[195:13.77]Right here.
[195:14.85]You just go up.
[195:23.12]save this guy he's fine he's the body blocker he is official body blocker
[195:57.63]Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[196:04.70]There's a lot of dwarves here.
[196:06.04]There better be a ton of good shit in here or I'm gonna be very upset.
[196:10.42]No, get off my archers!
[196:25.33]Alright, run away.
[196:26.21]No, fuck!
[196:27.07]I thought I had the other guy selected.
[196:31.21]I had... I thought I had... that this guy was selected.
[196:43.56]I'm fine, there's just a... There, see?
[196:55.27]Just kill him.
[196:58.19]Alright, you got one dwarf left.
[197:04.69]Not a big deal.
[197:05.37]A costly battle.
[197:16.44]Just walk over there, it's fine.
[197:21.64]There it is.
[197:24.02]2,000 experience.
[197:24.50]That's a lot.
[197:25.62]I did lose some, but... You know, that was a hundred dwarves, guys.
[197:32.19]Advanced resistance.
[197:33.99]Yes.
[197:36.75]Having defeated the battle dwarves, you discover five crystals and 5,000 gold.
[197:40.23]That's actually exactly what I needed.
[197:46.62]Here's an obelisk.
[197:50.11]I don't know what to do here, though.
[197:51.83]Unfortunately, this is not good.
[197:54.12]This is not good at all.
[197:56.72]Nobody else to recruit.
[197:57.68]I kind of have to run away or sacrifice myself.
[198:07.42]I got the guy on the boat, but he might just... Okay.
[198:10.37]Perfect scenario is he turns around and is pissed that I took the boat and fights me.
[198:17.49]There's nowhere for me to go.
[198:22.84]Hide.
[198:24.44]Hide.
[198:24.84]What is the hide?
[198:26.52]He has a full turn coming up.
[198:32.46]Bring Thant out?
[198:33.50]Should I bring Thant out and just have him just run down here?
[198:39.05]I could do that.
[198:46.41]Are you ready for this?
[199:00.51]Let's go.
[199:05.99]Oh, you're dead.
[199:06.93]You ran right by me.
[199:10.35]Alright, obelisk.
[199:12.13]What the hell?
[199:13.39]Puzzle map.
[199:17.21]What is this?
[199:20.23]Puzzle map?
[199:24.72]What do I do with this?
[199:30.13]I have missing pieces?
[199:31.15]Or... Hmm.
[199:42.10]I need all the pieces.
[199:42.98]I don't have it.
[199:45.02]Alright, we have some... Some shit going down.
[199:49.56]Self.
[199:51.47]Expert.
[199:52.13]I didn't say I was an expert.
[199:53.35]I said I played this when I was a young kid.
[199:55.13]I don't know what that does.
[200:00.55]Alright, uh, Warrior's Tomb.
[200:02.39]Let's keep going.
[200:03.23]What is this one?
[200:06.11]Haste.
[200:07.11]That's a good spell.
[200:11.49]Warrior's Tomb.
[200:12.40]Mushrooms.
[200:13.80]Let's just get a little view here.
[200:15.44]Oh, fuck.
[200:21.36]Uh-oh.
[200:23.50]Alright.
[200:24.74]This is a fight.
[200:25.74]This is a fight to end all fights.
[200:30.93]What do you think?
[200:31.85]Is it time?
[200:32.76]Is it time to go nuts?
[200:36.54]I'll get a lot of experience for this one.
[200:38.06]Here we go.
[200:44.91]Skeleton horde versus very powerful genies and very powerful Queens.
[200:57.54]Hang on.
[200:58.94]Okay, we've got... Let me take a look here.
[201:03.28]Genie.
[201:04.54]Genie can move very, very fluidly.
[201:06.96]We've got Bloodlust.
[201:08.16]Curse.
[201:09.66]Protection from fire.
[201:12.17]Increase the hand-to-hand damage inflicted by the selected unit.
[201:15.83]Cause the selected enemy unit to inflict minimum damage in combat.
[201:18.97]Hmm.
[201:26.09]This spell will affect nobody.
[201:27.39]Okay.
[201:28.39]What about Bloodlust?
[201:29.19]Should I give Bloodlust to the Genie?
[201:32.69]Or Bloodlust to the Naga Queens?
[201:38.95]Stoneskin?
[201:45.89]How long does it last?
[201:47.25]Just for the whole thing?
[201:50.44]Bloodlust on the Naga Queens.
[201:54.95]We're gonna get these guys in a favorable position.
[201:57.93]I'm gonna say, like... right here.
[202:05.13]Same deal, get you guys in a favorable position.
[202:07.17]Alright, we've got the Naga Queens.
[202:18.58]They're gonna want you up here, probably.
[202:24.30]Let's get, like, up here.
[202:29.26]Ooh, that hurts.
[202:29.88]Alright, you're ranged.
[202:36.09]Nice.
[202:36.93]That does a lot.
[202:37.87]Just get you guys up there.
[202:38.65]You're just, like, a shield, essentially, at this point.
[202:40.27]I need the mages.
[202:42.07]Who else is ranged?
[202:45.83]Nice.
[202:46.19]Beautiful.
[202:49.83]Oh, I thought that was going to do it.
[202:56.35]Vampire.
[202:57.83]Alright.
[202:58.53]Going for the Queens.
[203:01.05]Genie time.
[203:02.59]Now.
[203:05.11]Spellcast a random benefit.
[203:07.81]He can pretty much go anywhere in the map.
[203:09.01]I wonder if I should just take out the Lich.
[203:11.13]I think I can get the Lich with the Gremlins.
[203:12.73]I mean, I could buff.
[203:15.55]Cast a spell on Obsidian Gargoyles.
[203:20.63]Cast a spell on the Naga Queens.
[203:28.61]Alright, what did I get?
[203:31.73]Shield.
[203:32.03]66.
[203:32.27]I'm going for a... I think... We'll go for the wraiths.
[203:46.42]Oh, that was easy.
[203:48.20]Trying to kill the... Oh, fuck.
[203:49.54]That was bad.
[203:50.20]Alright.
[203:50.72]I'm going to go with the Queens up here.
[203:52.98]Big unit versus big unit.
[203:53.98]Let's go.
[203:58.15]What did that do?
[203:58.61]How much did it kill?
[204:05.17]Get rid of this guy.
[204:08.90]Did one.
[204:09.42]I mean, this thing is insane.
[204:11.84]So, once this is done, it's over.
[204:15.02]Okay, I gotta play smart here.
[204:31.08]I can't curse anybody blood maybe bloodlust on on genie or do more like stone skin on the naga curse I don't think I can that's it there's nobody like this I can't curse anybody
[204:55.16]I'm gonna do Stoneskin on Naga.
[205:03.34]Alright, we gotta focus on this dude here.
[205:06.88]Two Black Knight's gone.
[205:07.80]Good.
[205:10.80]This thing has to die.
[205:13.93]Genie.
[205:14.31]Should I just buff the Queen again?
[205:17.39]Should we just buff the fuck out of the Queens?
[205:21.87]I think I can kill it.
[205:26.04]Yes!
[205:26.79]Alright, we're good.
[205:28.79]62 versus 10?
[205:31.07]5.
[205:32.55]It's in the bag.
[205:33.37]Yeah, this is in the bag.
[205:41.09]Ain't got nothing.
[205:41.86]I win.
[205:43.98]Ran away.
[205:48.48]I lost.
[205:50.62]Not very much.
[205:54.88]Level 4, Advanced Wisdom.
[205:57.88]Fourth level spells or basic water magic.
[206:03.98]It's a good thing I had this guy.
[206:08.95]Hmm.
[206:10.81]Let's do water magic.
[206:14.49]Alright.
[206:15.93]Cool.
[206:17.73]Alright, back to bed.
[206:20.61]That's all I wanted you to do.
[206:21.43]I wanted you to go get more minions.
[206:23.75]You, on the other hand...
[206:26.10]There's a boat there now.
[206:27.12]I have a scout.
[206:31.21]I can do two boats.
[206:33.61]Not yet.
[206:35.63]You need to go exploring.
[206:37.71]Riding hole.
[206:45.83]Here's to search.
[206:46.51]Yes.
[206:47.63]Nothing there.
[206:57.41]Got nothing in there.
[206:58.27]What do you have?
[207:07.27]You got a lot of stuff too.
[207:08.31]Make another boat.
[207:11.17]I think I'm gonna do two boats here.
[207:12.41]Yeah, let's go.
[207:20.68]Let's get in there.
[207:24.32]Opportunity down here.
[207:27.51]Middle thing in the castle.
[207:28.67]I can do the trolls, maybe.
[207:29.89]How are we doing on resources?
[207:36.07]Wall of knowledge.
[207:37.03]How much is this?
[207:38.91]Five and a thousand.
[207:39.61]Yeah, just build it.
[207:40.79]Let's go.
[207:41.19]Plus one knowledge.
[207:43.33]Anybody that goes in, I've got able to recruit.
[207:47.17]Alright.
[207:47.47]Let's go.
[207:55.40]Uh-oh.
[207:56.48]I'm on the defensive now.
[207:57.96]Who came in?
[207:59.56]Oh, shit.
[208:00.24]It's purple.
[208:03.42]Who did he attack?
[208:04.38]Oh, I'm down there.
[208:05.47]I don't... This is bad.
[208:07.85]You've got unicorns.
[208:08.75]Shit.
[208:16.05]This is not good.
[208:18.29]This is a losing battle.
[208:28.29]100 it's the same guy with the 100 plus centaurs um but I could probably take a few people out and then run away
[208:55.56]This is so many crystal things to lose.
[208:58.06]Ugh.
[209:02.60]Nooo.
[209:04.42]So, wait, what does surrender do?
[209:09.83]What's the difference?
[209:16.97]I'm just gonna, I mean, I'm just gonna, I, I, apparently I'm just gonna run.
[209:33.30]Surrender lets you keep your army for a price.
[209:35.64]Oh, no, fuck that.
[209:38.66]Thankfully, this guy doesn't have the whole army.
[209:41.80]Ugh.
[209:48.05]I lose badly in both scenarios.
[209:52.67]How much is it to surrender?
[209:53.63]I wonder, like, what do I have to pay?
[210:05.60]I'm out.
[210:21.91]Coward.
[210:25.63]But at least I keep the artifact.
[210:29.33]He's back.
[210:36.81]I had a lot of artifacts on that guy.
[210:38.21]I ain't gonna lose him.
[210:44.46]We're good.
[210:48.95]Okay.
[210:51.01]Now you... This is our new main, anyways.
[210:55.43]One knowledge.
[211:10.69]Give me your shit.
[211:13.82]Come outside, please.
[211:22.64]Alright.
[211:23.80]Level 8 versus level 4.
[211:28.70]I mean, I guess we could... He's level 8.
[211:30.88]Should I just give him everything?
[211:35.53]Maybe I'll just give him everything.
[211:37.13]Because he's level 8.
[211:43.79]Ballista.
[211:44.77]I can only have one Ballista.
[211:46.03]I can do the 10.
[211:51.31]This is a Glyph of Gallantry.
[211:52.45]Mirabai 1 or Health of All Units.
[211:55.03]No, that's way better.
[212:04.33]Get out of the way.
[212:05.09]Okay.
[212:14.01]Thant has better... I'm gonna keep Thant on defense.
[212:20.76]In fact, I wanna... Okay.
[212:24.62]You've already visited.
[212:25.30]I gotta get something else here, though.
[212:31.52]Oh yeah, the gold, gold, gold.
[212:32.92]Give me the bag.
[212:33.56]Switch the bag.
[212:38.48]That'll be forever protected.
[212:39.66]Oh, I can actually take this.
[212:41.68]Because now I gave him a bag of gold.
[212:45.49]Very nice.
[212:46.65]Very nice.
[212:50.05]Get back in here.
[212:50.71]It is your job to... I think I have to move you.
[213:02.48]He is the one that will defend this castle.
[213:05.26]Get in here.
[213:12.66]Summon boat.
[213:13.28]Dispel.
[213:16.04]Slow.
[213:16.72]Stone skin.
[213:23.54]Can I learn any of these?
[213:24.42]I have to upgrade it.
[213:28.48]Yeah, it's level one.
[213:30.66]What is that?
[213:31.65]Thousand.
[213:32.29]Just cost resources.
[213:33.37]Alright.
[213:34.96]We'll switch it out.
[213:36.56]You have a lot of good people now.
[213:39.36]You're a force to be reckoned with completely.
[213:45.33]I'm looking.
[213:45.69]Hopefully I can recruit something.
[213:47.73]I could get some more golems.
[213:51.71]Alright, I'm going back down.
[213:52.55]Alright, we got boats.
[213:57.11]You have 47 golems.
[214:01.32]I wonder if I can fight the trolls with these.
[214:03.56]I'm kind of scared to do that.
[214:06.38]Yeah, what is Nimbus's specialty?
[214:07.68]That's a good question.
[214:10.04]Specialty is Eagle Eye.
[214:11.18]Receives a 5% per level bonus to Eagle Eye skill percentage.
[214:14.55]What about you?
[214:16.99]What's your specialty?
[214:19.09]Eagle Eye again.
[214:20.51]This dude sucks.
[214:21.37]This dude's only purpose is to, like, walk around and look at stuff.
[214:25.43]Nobody even here.
[214:29.77]Claim that castle.
[214:32.14]It's mine.
[214:33.96]You are going to go... Who's over here?
[214:35.64]You, a shipyard.
[214:38.84]Avoid that and go down here.
[214:39.92]You know what I'm saying?
[214:42.52]Like up this way, maybe?
[214:46.52]Or down here.
[214:47.04]Let's go down here.
[214:59.64]He's taking everything back.
[215:04.45]wood elf growth plus five dwellings increased population damn it I'm so annoyed right at the last day they came back ah that sucks why is this guy always pre-recorded streams it's just easier that way
[215:31.74]I actually, weirdly enough, we can bring this up now.
[215:38.37]I'm actually like 52 years old.
[215:41.83]By the time you're seeing this, I've recorded like 8 or 9 thousand, like 6 hour sessions.
[215:49.34]And I batch uploaded all of them and they're all scheduled to go.
[215:54.32]I'm actually like 50.
[215:55.02]I've been doing this, I did this like, I don't know, maybe 30, like 20 years ago or so.
[216:01.37]It's kind of... I guess that kind of thing can come out.
[216:05.14]Sirens.
[216:12.54]What did that say?
[216:13.26]A bunch of people dove out of... A bunch of people drowned themselves.
[216:24.51]That's great.
[216:26.09]I lost half my army.
[216:28.97]That sucks.
[216:30.29]Ugh.
[216:33.92]Let's go with +2 attack.
[216:36.02]I don't want to get in there so bad, and I can't do anything about that either.
[216:42.28]No, this dude's just gonna have to go explore over on this side.
[216:49.49]Yeah, he's already shown these to me.
[217:00.36]Castle ship, go take it.
[217:01.60]I don't think I can.
[217:04.44]I have like 40 frogs.
[217:05.23]I don't think they're going to be good enough.
[217:06.75]Yeah, they have a bunch of better units than I do.
[217:19.34]I'll just get down here.
[217:26.57]Hmm.
[217:28.71]I think I can handle this stuff here now.
[217:36.21]Yeah, I can handle this.
[217:37.19]I'm going up here.
[217:37.73]That's a gold mine.
[217:42.45]That's a mercenary camp.
[217:45.51]Let's go for it.
[217:52.58]No, I learned that.
[217:54.42]War Machine Factory.
[217:55.34]I already have one of these.
[217:57.78]Lots of harpy hags.
[217:59.74]That will be the next thing I do.
[218:03.18]Speaking of doing...
[218:10.00]Level two.
[218:17.04]Remove obstacle lightning bolt disrupting ray and fortune.
[218:24.37]Hmm.
[218:25.37]Cool.
[218:30.15]And other town.
[218:31.09]Don't have enough money.
[218:43.90]Let's go.
[218:49.72]All the purple is over here.
[218:50.72]On the right side.
[218:52.45]Here's the fucking taxes again.
[218:56.55]Goose eggs.
[218:57.35]Zero everywhere.
[219:00.63]What do you guys have?
[219:02.79]Pack several lots.
[219:05.77]Pack.
[219:06.09]I could kill this one.
[219:17.29]I do have a lot of gems.
[219:18.15]Gotta have a lot of gem, um... I have more gem buildings than I have anything else.
[219:24.60]Alright, you just keep going over here.
[219:26.26]Dammit.
[219:32.64]Alright, harpy hags!
[219:38.17]Do not engage.
[219:39.71]They're afraid.
[219:40.71]Touch the obelisk.
[219:45.18]Puzzle map.
[219:45.92]They'll have them all.
[219:49.32]Unfortunately.
[219:50.48]Lots of captains.
[219:51.64]Centaur captains.
[219:57.77]I wonder if I can do it.
[220:02.61]Don't engage.
[220:03.09]They're afraid.
[220:06.55]Recruit stone gargoyles.
[220:08.67]How many do I have?
[220:11.38]No, I don't want that.
[220:13.22]Now this is where it's going to get hard.
[220:15.74]These are absolutely going to attack me.
[220:20.33]Morale increased.
[220:22.65]Lots of silver.
[220:24.23]Pegas high.
[220:28.23]They scatter.
[220:29.83]I'm so powerful.
[220:31.33]Thousand more a day.
[220:33.15]Nice.
[220:33.63]Awesome.
[220:33.91]And I'll go to the mercenary camp up here and get all this stuff.
[220:39.14]Now what the hell am I going to do to you?
[220:41.58]He's gonna put you- this is just a scout.
[220:46.13]Head this way.
[220:46.69]I mean, he's definitely- he's dead.
[220:57.67]He's dead.
[220:59.17]Uh-oh, they got a bone dragon.
[221:06.34]Time to die.
[221:14.02]Four.
[221:14.34]You killed fucking thirty-three?
[221:19.32]Twenty-five to fifty damage.
[221:20.70]That's insane.
[221:26.72]Let's go this way!
[221:32.26]Ow!
[221:34.02]Hey, you!
[221:45.05]Get that motherfucker out of here.
[221:52.88]Lots of... They're gonna run away too.
[221:54.22]Alright.
[221:56.92]Look at all this shit up here.
[221:57.84]We got Mercenary camp.
[221:59.92]Plus one attack.
[222:02.14]A thousand experience.
[222:04.04]Expert resistance.
[222:06.67]That's huge.
[222:09.03]20% magic resistance.
[222:11.47]A thousand gold for 500 experience.
[222:13.51]We're gonna do the experience, I think.
[222:22.64]Both of them.
[222:23.04]1500 experience.
[222:27.81]Level 10.
[222:29.47]Expert Wisdom.
[222:31.39]Basic Learning.
[222:34.17]That seems like... Expert Wisdom or Basic Learning.
[222:39.86]Are they the same kind of thing?
[222:48.14]Level 5.
[222:48.98]Level Spells.
[222:49.64]I gotta go back and do this.
[222:53.76]Expert wisdom.
[222:56.81]Wisdom in learning.
[222:59.49]High wisdom, low intelligence.
[223:05.93]Should I be... Should I learn?
[223:07.31]No, that's just experience.
[223:08.91]But... Alright, we're gonna do the basic learning.
[223:12.25]Alright, I've cleaned this out.
[223:17.12]This guy's pretty strong now.
[223:19.04]My only concern is now with... The unguarded...
[223:24.74]Couple of places here.
[223:26.78]Someone's going to be coming here.
[223:30.55]You just landed.
[223:31.21]What do you got?
[223:32.23]That's not good.
[223:37.75]Purple is going to be coming up this way.
[223:39.21]I have to bring you back to the castle.
[223:41.67]You can just go, like, Magellan this way.
[223:43.61]Is there nothing over here?
[223:47.30]Don't even tell me there's nothing here.
[224:01.82]Artifact, Merchant, Library, Lookout Tower.
[224:04.94]I can do that.
[224:05.48]No, that's 10,000.
[224:07.30]Let's just recruit some people.
[224:10.62]I'm going to spend the money.
[224:13.96]Just in case for some reason he gets here.
[224:21.64]Let's go.
[224:24.10]Depends on what Purple's going to do.
[224:27.48]Oh, no.
[224:29.14]Fucking got it.
[224:29.72]Did he just go in the boat?
[224:36.49]Ah, he's taking everything.
[224:37.87]What am I doing out here?
[224:38.95]There's nothing even out.
[224:39.69]There's just rocks.
[224:44.97]Oh, shit.
[224:48.63]Holy ground.
[224:52.51]There's just rocks and shit.
[224:55.07]He took all my stuff.
[224:57.65]Where are you?
[225:00.41]Throng horde, horde, swarm horde, pack.
[225:06.05]Is this a fight?
[225:06.59]I mean, there's probably like 300.
[225:10.85]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[225:16.25]This is going to be a battle at the castle, I think.
[225:17.75]I'm not going to be able to make it back.
[225:32.02]I'm not gonna be able to make it back in time.
[225:42.50]No, we're okay.
[225:44.04]This is a pretty decent defense.
[225:58.53]Yeah.
[226:12.68]See what happens.
[226:32.82]Thank God.
[226:33.62]What an idiot.
[226:34.14]Yes!
[226:35.32]Oh, he didn't do anything.
[226:36.15]He just turned around.
[226:37.21]He got scared.
[226:41.26]Come on!
[226:41.82]I have to wait another turn to do this?
[226:44.84]Give me my stuff back!
[226:51.61]It's mine, not yours.
[226:52.55]I just ruined everything.
[226:56.45]I just fucking ruined everything.
[226:58.27]He can kill me now.
[227:00.33]Because of the goddamn gold mine.
[227:01.83]Or gem mine.
[227:02.51]Whatever the hell it was.
[227:03.37]I'm dead.
[227:05.05]If he decides to turn around and attack me, I'm dead.
[227:13.95]Oh, thank God he went the other way.
[227:15.87]I'm excited about this, though.
[227:17.87]This is completely uncharted territory.
[227:24.44]Whoa.
[227:28.02]This is a dragon utopia.
[227:36.74]You stand before the dragon utopia, a place off-limits to mere humans.
[227:41.72]Do you wish to violate this rule and challenge the dragons to a fight?
[227:50.71]I don't think I do.
[227:56.75]But that's cool that it's down here.
[227:59.62]I could probably recruit.
[228:00.48]Like next level dragons down here.
[228:07.86]Save scum it and just see what it is?
[228:20.53]Couldn't go back in.
[228:21.25]I think the cursor wouldn't let me do it.
[228:26.17]Because I was already standing on the space.
[228:31.03]I was standing on the one spot where I was allowed to do it, so I had to move.
[228:34.31]Let me just do it again.
[228:37.81]I already learned that.
[228:44.18]I already learned that.
[228:45.10]Let's go... I'm actually not afraid anymore.
[228:52.86]I already cleaned this all out.
[229:00.41]Um... I feel like... No, I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna keep... I'm gonna recruit more.
[229:07.17]Yeah.
[229:15.09]I'm gonna take all these guys, because I want to be unbeatable.
[229:22.50]over here alright I need a what do I need 20 wood fuck what is this five wood not worth it I need the wood city hall I need mage and yeah but I just I'm gonna burn all my wood whatever
[229:54.24]Nobody claims this.
[229:55.20]Yeah, tax day is coming up, you're right.
[230:08.58]Well, you're just stuck down here now.
[230:18.83]I was, um... I just forgot.
[230:21.81]I was supposed to just go look in there, but I saved it.
[230:23.71]It don't matter.
[230:25.09]I'm alright.
[230:25.89]Whatever.
[230:29.61]If I, like... Okay, if I went in there and I died, I would have had to do, like, that whole last turn again.
[230:33.65]I don't know.
[230:34.11]Whatever.
[230:34.63]Don't matter.
[230:37.73]Like, do you really want me to, like, redo the last whole turn?
[230:59.24]There's no way I'm doing this.
[231:09.21]Well, it's every kind of dragon.
[231:11.47]What do they have for stats?
[231:13.35]40 to 50, 40 to... No, you gotta come in here with... Like a hundred.
[231:25.86]At least.
[231:28.03]Dead...
[231:33.54]Well, there it is.
[231:38.93]That's a cool little thing, though.
[231:40.91]That's an interesting little, like, secret.
[231:42.19]Alright, I was gonna go up here.
[231:44.67]And I was gonna do this.
[231:49.13]I want more minions.
[231:51.81]And then I'm taking you on a boat.
[231:53.27]And we're gonna try to kill somebody.
[231:54.57]I'm gonna try to wipe somebody up.
[231:56.47]This turn coming up.
[231:57.17]Alright, no, it was this one over here.
[232:02.29]Tavern!
[232:13.94]You have made us very pleased.
[232:15.58]Good.
[232:18.32]You have to just get out of here.
[232:21.86]You just... I hate that.
[232:23.91]I have to do this shit.
[232:24.81]Alright.
[232:27.51]I want... Mage tower level 3.
[232:32.41]I need... 6 pots.
[232:37.70]I can get that right now.
[232:49.16]Learn spells!
[232:51.63]Level 3.
[232:51.95]Wonder what else we got.
[232:54.65]We got air shield, destroy undead, force field.
[232:57.91]Let's bring him in.
[233:05.43]And we're going to... look at this.
[233:11.82]So many.
[233:14.58]So many.
[233:22.23]Should I take them all?
[233:23.19]I mean, I'll be unstoppable.
[233:27.83]Alright, let's learn a spell.
[233:29.51]So, destroy undead.
[233:31.51]Attempts to destroy any undead creatures on the battlefield.
[233:36.07]Force field.
[233:38.81]Place a small force field on the battlefield at a point specified by the caster.
[233:43.89]Destroy undead sounds really good.
[233:46.13]Shields a selected unit, reducing the amount of damage received from ranged attacks.
[233:49.49]That's really good, too.
[233:57.86]Maybe destroy undead.
[234:03.49]So now how do I put a spell on?
[234:07.13]I'm curious.
[234:10.15]How do I get it on here?
[234:12.57]Right click?
[234:13.07]Or... Do I just do it together?
[234:21.18]Oh, you auto-learn them.
[234:23.86]Okay.
[234:24.08]That makes sense.
[234:25.98]Let me just make sure.
[234:29.57]Ah, alright, cool.
[234:30.89]So you just get them all.
[234:34.07]Alright, uh, we're at the end of the week.
[234:36.51]I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna recruit, and then I'm... This is the character that is... Nimbus is going to kill everyone.
[234:41.26]I'm gonna take him on a journey to wipe out every opponent.
[234:46.36]I've upgraded all my dudes.
[234:50.00]I'm ready for a fucking bloodbath.
[234:55.30]Anything else I can get up here that has been taken from me?
[234:58.72]Let's go to the windmill.
[234:59.98]Just three six crystals.
[235:01.22]Might as well take it.
[235:01.98]Alright, I'm good like this.
[235:10.37]I guess I could... I need... No, I don't have any resources for it.
[235:18.65]Let's go.
[235:21.76]Here comes a new week.
[235:30.65]All dwellings increase population.
[235:35.22]Unfortunately, you're just stuck back here for an undetermined amount of time.
[235:38.44]Alright.
[235:41.44]Money.
[235:43.71]Recruit everyone.
[235:46.17]I am now a real ruler.
[235:55.62]I've got a lot of people.
[235:57.04]A very scary amount.
[235:59.26]I have very highly skilled people.
[236:02.62]I don't know if I want the skeletons.
[236:03.98]18 Queens.
[236:10.26]Alright, I need fucking 20 wood.
[236:15.22]I'm gonna have to do the Mage Guild and then the City Hall.
[236:25.77]Alright.
[236:26.84]I can't do it yet.
[236:29.36]But, I am ready.
[236:31.82]The question is... Should I?
[236:36.06]Hmm.
[236:38.56]Should I take this fucking place over?
[236:40.69]It's mine.
[236:42.83]Get it.
[236:43.21]Take it from Orange.
[236:44.69]Go take all this stuff.
[236:48.57]And then summon a boat down here.
[236:50.11]I think I can take this.
[236:50.83]I think I can kill them both.
[236:56.96]And then take a boat.
[237:00.92]It's either that, or the other scenario is... I could go here.
[237:06.21]Right, so run down here.
[237:10.23]Go try to kill the dragons?
[237:13.49]Oh, that's so scary.
[237:14.81]If I go kill the dragons, I have nobody available to defend my only remaining two structures.
[237:23.79]The troll bridge...
[237:27.00]Yeah.
[237:32.90]But then you'll have dragons.
[237:34.40]Yeah, I need to build up defenses too.
[237:38.27]I've got to go, like, wipe somebody.
[237:40.13]I've got to go kill somebody.
[237:43.81]I've got to get up here.
[237:44.49]He's, like, right here.
[237:52.84]I could take this.
[237:54.42]Take this, kill him.
[237:58.17]Go to the troll bridge.
[238:00.96]I gotta get this guy in a boat anyways, so let's get in a boat.
[238:10.18]Alright, let's go.
[238:16.27]Blue is not sure what he wants to do.
[238:21.93]There's the taxes.
[238:23.30]Didn't have anything anyways.
[238:26.62]You are so far away.
[238:27.90]It just takes forever for you to get over here.
[238:30.02]Okay, how many points?
[238:32.84]I got 100 points.
[238:37.86]Uh... I could go to the Golem Factory.
[238:43.70]Which there are... Who should I get?
[238:45.80]What do you think?
[238:50.16]Two diamond?
[238:52.40]Or three gold?
[239:00.27]Why not both?
[239:00.95]I don't have enough room for both.
[239:02.48]I only have one more slot.
[239:04.86]Diamond?
[239:05.64]Yeah, diamond's probably better.
[239:12.40]Gold's more cost effective, but diamond is almost unhurtable from spells.
[239:18.77]This is iron, right?
[239:21.55]Okay.
[239:24.39]Pretty good group.
[239:27.73]Let's see if I can summon a boat.
[239:31.71]Well, you have a boat.
[239:32.43]Should I just trade?
[239:33.27]You wanna trade boats?
[239:34.27]I'm just... Boy, I've been so fucked with wood this whole game.
[239:59.00]Uh-oh.
[240:00.76]You going to the dragon?
[240:03.74]This guy's heading to, like, the dragon's den.
[240:07.87]Uh-oh.
[240:10.25]Like, I need to get away from you.
[240:18.09]Nobody in here.
[240:26.24]Well, I don't think I can fight you.
[240:30.11]Although, we don't really have anything that scary.
[240:32.89]We have packs.
[240:33.63]Small.
[240:35.07]No.
[240:36.73]He's gonna go die to the dragons.
[240:38.75]Let me see if I can get a boat here.
[240:45.04]Because there's a couple of boats.
[240:50.92]Summoned boat.
[240:54.12]Do you not have summoned boat?
[240:56.91]Fuck, you don't have summoned boat.
[241:09.11]Well, I'm just going to have to wait until you bring it up here.
[241:11.09]I clicked the wrong button.
[241:26.94]Oh, there it is.
[241:29.93]Did I get it?
[241:41.17]How do I cast it?
[241:52.42]Not from the inventory.
[241:53.90]That is not the spell book?
[241:56.80]I thought it was.
[241:58.58]Bail to summon a boat.
[242:04.16]I thought I could do it from both places.
[242:06.43]Is this even possible?
[242:09.03]Is there even a friendly boat?
[242:12.27]There are no boats to some and I just wasted fucking points.
[242:14.53]Just bring it over here.
[242:24.41]He's going to the dragon.
[242:26.43]He's gonna die.
[242:28.25]He's actually gonna die.
[242:29.61]He has no idea.
[242:34.77]Switch the boat.
[242:36.19]Come here.
[242:44.12]Ah!
[242:45.98]Damn it!
[242:48.10]No, I was right there!
[242:49.66]No!
[242:51.40]Fuck!
[242:53.60]I... Oh, whatever.
[242:54.90]Fuck it.
[243:03.94]to do another turn anyways.
[243:11.10]Oh, you're dead.
[243:12.13]You're dead.
[243:12.73]You're dead.
[243:17.43]We're gonna do the old switcheroo.
[243:18.63]Watch this.
[243:21.43]Put him in this boat.
[243:23.29]You think it's this person in the boat.
[243:27.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[243:33.22]Give me all your stuff.
[243:37.20]What do you have?
[243:40.87]Alright, now you go on the boat and he's gonna attack the boat and be like, holy shit, this guy's unbeatable.
[243:45.19]Pack, lots, throng.
[243:46.23]He's got dragons.
[243:50.99]He has fucking red dragons.
[243:53.40]But he only has packs of the other ones.
[244:06.28]Wait for him on land.
[244:11.31]I don't know what to do.
[244:12.25]I don't know what to do, because this is... I could die.
[244:14.15]Just save it.
[244:24.28]I'm just gonna go in the boat.
[244:32.40]He's not... He's gonna avoid me.
[244:34.96]Look, this lady's...
[244:38.42]He's not going to attack.
[244:39.38]What if he does?
[244:41.09]I can't attack him from here.
[244:51.37]He actually is coming for the dragon.
[244:52.55]He doesn't have enough to do that.
[245:04.85]Make sure he doesn't get him.
[245:09.28]In fact, here.
[245:09.82]Do you want?
[245:10.57]Here, take these.
[245:13.87]Take these.
[245:14.31]I just got some more of them.
[245:15.81]You can have them.
[245:18.29]Oh, no, no, no.
[245:18.67]I got the... No, never mind.
[245:23.61]What do you think?
[245:24.07]Should I fight it?
[245:25.01]Should I go for it?
[245:48.57]Okay.
[245:50.05]Louie's priority here.
[245:58.98]14.
[245:59.02]That's not that big of a deal.
[246:01.36]I think that's the only ranged unit they have.
[246:04.48]180 health.
[246:05.12]Jesus.
[246:05.74]This is the one that's going to be the horrible, horrible, horrible problem.
[246:08.60]I don't have curse.
[246:25.65]lightning bolt 135 oh my god I can lightning bolt a dragon is the dragon immune immune to spells one through three that's horrible lightning bolt the centaurs
[246:49.27]I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the Centaurs, I think.
[246:55.37]See if I can kill, like, 30 of them.
[246:59.44]That's not 30 of them.
[247:02.20]That's not 30 of them.
[247:03.24]That was, like, seven.
[247:08.30]Fuck.
[247:09.74]The Genie.
[247:10.24]Who should... I'm gonna buff somebody with the Genie.
[247:12.00]Who should I buff?
[247:13.93]Who should be buffed?
[247:15.07]Um... Somebody with range, probably.
[247:23.65]Fire Shield.
[247:24.79]Alright.
[247:26.37]Nobody move.
[247:29.53]Nobody move.
[247:35.18]Where should I throw this at?
[247:36.32]Probably the ranged.
[247:42.62]Get rid of the ranged.
[247:46.66]The ranged is gone.
[247:47.30]Okay.
[247:47.50]Now I just have to worry about the Pegasus and shift.
[247:53.04]Alright, you're expendable.
[247:54.84]Get on the plank.
[247:58.43]You are also expendable.
[247:59.75]You go- Oh, you should have gone on the other plank.
[248:03.65]It's just the golems.
[248:04.55]They're supposed to be doing this.
[248:10.59]Morale going down.
[248:11.63]Here we go.
[248:19.91]What if the dragon just fell over and died?
[248:22.85]Alright, here I come.
[248:23.77]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!
[248:28.08]Oh, please, shit, you suck.
[248:30.32]Oh no.
[248:32.30]Oh no.
[248:33.14]I think we're good.
[248:34.34]We're fine.
[248:35.42]Genie.
[248:36.26]What's the genie doing?
[248:37.30]I need to... The dragon is back here.
[248:40.82]Kill the dragon.
[248:42.44]Bop the naga.
[248:45.67]Frenzy.
[248:48.89]Oh!
[248:51.31]Oh, how many just died?
[248:52.45]12.
[249:00.26]No, it's fine.
[249:00.74]I thought that was 103 died.
[249:03.44]Just kill the dragon.
[249:07.06]Holy shit, he was pathetic.
[249:08.45]That was wicked easy.
[249:20.72]This is the scary part.
[249:22.90]Oh no, it's not scary at all.
[249:24.54]I'm fucking unbeatable.
[249:31.53]Unstoppable.
[249:32.45]Nobody can beat me.
[249:35.15]It's game over.
[249:45.84]Doesn't matter.
[249:46.64]I win.
[249:50.61]4,000 experience.
[249:57.90]You learned Ice Bolt.
[250:00.16]Basic sorcery.
[250:01.06]5% more damage.
[250:04.68]I like it.
[250:05.04]We're good to go.
[250:09.64]Didn't lose very much.
[250:10.40]I'm gonna go sac their kingdom now.
[250:15.56]And we got... Is that... Oh, you got... Is that red?
[250:17.92]Oh, you got some... You got some shit over here, don't you?
[250:26.40]Where do I want to go?
[250:40.00]What's the destination, I wonder?
[250:45.66]I could kill this.
[250:46.98]I could go here and clean up this whole... I'm going here.
[250:52.20]Fight the dragons.
[250:55.18]I'm actually... Yeah, I'm going to change this up a little bit here.
[250:59.46]I don't... I want to get rid of this.
[251:02.49]I'm not going to... I kind of...
[251:09.66]Nimbus is not going to die.
[251:10.58]Nimbus is going to be fine, because I want skeletons.
[251:13.32]Yeah, I can... Let me just transfer.
[251:15.14]Hold on.
[251:19.29]Come here.
[251:21.71]Skeletons are actually really important.
[251:23.93]I need a space for them.
[251:34.86]Okay, I'm ready.
[251:41.58]Let's go kill the trolls.
[251:42.96]I have a lot of money, too.
[251:46.91]Let's not forget.
[251:47.61]That I should probably be buying things.
[251:53.97]Level 4.
[251:54.69]I don't have any pots.
[251:56.11]But what about over here?
[252:00.51]Mage guild level 1.
[252:01.53]That is required for the city hall.
[252:07.83]I could take these and upgrade them, too.
[252:13.78]Alright, City Hall is next.
[252:21.59]Did he die?
[252:21.95]I don't think he went in.
[252:29.92]He didn't go in yet.
[252:34.18]Here we go.
[252:35.84]Who is here?
[252:38.08]Trolls.
[252:41.66]Should I just... Is there a reason for me to do this?
[252:43.60]I don't think there's a reason for me to fight this.
[252:52.98]Well.
[252:55.72]I'm gonna buff the wizards.
[252:58.18]Slow.
[253:27.35]Oh, wait, I can... No, I don't want them, though.
[253:30.07]Damn it.
[253:34.97]Ah, that's too bad.
[253:40.46]No, I don't want them.
[253:44.52]Wasn't even worth hiring.
[253:45.58]I have 80 points now.
[253:46.64]Alright, let's go claim this shit.
[253:51.41]I'm gonna take it.
[253:52.46]There's a, just this one, there's a bug in here.
[253:54.20]There's a single bug.
[254:02.00]You can just... What the hell am I gonna have you do?
[254:08.12]I don't know.
[254:08.58]Go defend the other one.
[254:09.81]Go defend this one.
[254:10.59]Just go back here and learn some spells and shit.
[254:20.37]City Hall.
[254:20.89]That's more money.
[254:23.25]I could spend some of this money too.
[254:24.41]Yeah, she can bring the... she can be the goblin transfer.
[254:31.61]Did that guy even go in there?
[254:32.83]I think he chickened out.
[254:35.47]Gold dragon growth plus five.
[254:37.14]New week.
[254:39.48]Alright, here we go.
[254:42.22]Take this castle.
[254:49.14]It's just 17 bugs.
[254:57.91]Just get the fuck in there.
[255:01.13]Thank you.
[255:02.65]Lost a couple of gnomes, but that's fine.
[255:06.40]Mine.
[255:08.60]Excellent.
[255:09.46]Okay.
[255:11.74]We're gonna get a hero here to defend.
[255:19.90]And I'm going to recruit all these people.
[255:23.34]Pretty sick.
[255:24.32]That's pretty decent defense.
[255:26.70]And we've got level 3 Death Knight.
[255:33.73]Yeah.
[255:37.07]Why can I not recruit you?
[255:37.85]Is it because I'm in the way?
[255:46.65]Call of Valhalla.
[255:51.30]Let me move out of the way.
[255:52.34]There we go.
[256:02.38]I've got a good defense here now.
[256:05.03]We got... Let's see.
[256:08.19]Yep, this is good.
[256:09.63]I'm going to... Escape tunnel.
[256:15.23]Flee from defending... Upgrade cliff nest... Thunderbirds.
[256:18.48]Thunderbirds.
[256:21.43]His specialty is... Liches.
[256:24.62]I don't think I have access to them in here, though.
[256:27.48]Not yet.
[256:29.62]Cyclops, Behemoth, Ogre.
[256:33.92]Orc Tower.
[256:34.68]I can make Orc Chieftains.
[256:37.31]Yeah, let's get it.
[256:40.91]Upgrade these to Chieftains.
[256:50.24]Two to five.
[256:51.12]Two to five.
[256:52.46]He's ranged as well.
[256:53.48]That's good.
[256:58.16]And you stay there.
[256:58.76]I do have a pretty good supply of these things.
[257:08.53]Fort requires... Let's do... No, I can't do it yet.
[257:17.77]I don't know.
[257:18.03]A capital needs... I just need a bunch of fucking ore.
[257:28.27]What is it to make the, um... I need a fort.
[257:36.31]No, I'm kind of behind.
[257:37.45]Alright.
[257:40.03]I have secured Island in the middle.
[257:45.04]I'm ready to get in the boat.
[257:47.42]This is protected.
[257:48.40]I don't have a problem here.
[257:52.73]I'm ready to keep going.
[257:54.61]You are on your way to this castle over here.
[257:57.95]Don't stop.
[258:00.21]Thank you.
[258:03.10]Isn't there somebody?
[258:03.72]Okay, you're still in here.
[258:07.64]This castle is now also defended and protected completely.
[258:14.83]In a good spot.
[258:26.70]Taxes.
[258:28.46]You headed here.
[258:29.46]Get the... No.
[258:33.36]This way.
[258:34.04]You're good.
[258:41.55]Cloud Temple.
[258:42.43]I need this.
[258:45.48]I'm just... Give me more wood!
[258:47.10]Come here.
[258:56.29]Alright, here's my thought process here.
[258:58.05]Yeah, I'm gonna wipe this up.
[259:01.37]Purple's done.
[259:02.21]This is Purple's base.
[259:03.83]It's over.
[259:05.40]I'm claiming this land.
[259:10.76]You're about to lose.
[259:11.30]I'm about to take over Purple.
[259:18.56]Can't do anything else.
[259:20.74]Everything is fortified.
[259:21.66]Yeah, you're running.
[259:25.46]We just came out.
[259:26.54]Okay.
[259:30.33]I'm not concerned at all.
[259:33.75]But I am going to save it, because, you know, why not?
[259:35.37]We've already seen this.
[259:46.84]I will take that.
[259:47.54]Thank you.
[259:48.90]It's one a day.
[259:49.54]I'm going right in your front door.
[259:59.60]Take the castle.
[260:19.24]Okay.
[260:21.20]They've got the unicorns.
[260:22.48]They've got not very... This is not that bad.
[260:24.36]It's just a question of getting rid of these.
[260:26.22]Destroy undead.
[260:31.34]Don't have any undead.
[260:33.22]Air shield.
[260:35.96]I feel like I could give this to somebody.
[260:39.00]Or maybe I should just... Bloodlust.
[260:44.58]Lightning bolt.
[260:45.24]Ice bolt.
[260:54.73]Force field.
[260:58.81]Lightning bolt.
[261:02.80]I wonder if I should just lightning bolt the archers here.
[261:04.96]Let's see what it does.
[261:12.21]It's pretty good.
[261:14.23]I'm going to buff...
[261:18.05]Who do I want to buff here?
[261:19.99]Probably one of the ranged.
[261:21.23]Probably like the mage.
[261:24.13]Or the... Yeah, the mage, I think.
[261:28.70]Prayer.
[261:30.86]Okay.
[261:32.34]The gargoyles can get in.
[261:35.14]I can get in with a gargoyle.
[261:37.64]I wonder if I should get in.
[261:42.70]Not right now, but I'm saying like jump over in a minute.
[261:48.26]Get in, hit, and get out.
[261:54.12]I wonder if it's something I should do.
[262:00.95]I'm going to try it.
[262:03.78]Holy shit, that was devastating.
[262:08.74]I cannot get in with the Naga.
[262:12.30]So I'm just gonna hold.
[262:18.44]They so desperately want to get rid of you.
[262:24.60]Nobody else can do anything.
[262:25.48]I'm gonna put people up in front, though.
[262:29.68]Skeletons just get up there and just take damage.
[262:34.63]Can I come out the front door?
[262:35.37]They're coming out.
[262:41.19]He's coming out the front door.
[262:44.03]Brave!
[262:47.88]I did not expect that.
[262:48.82]I thought they were going to stay in the walls.
[262:50.10]They're coming outside.
[262:51.96]Okay, this just got a little bit hairy.
[262:55.72]I'm staying with Clint.
[263:00.37]Okay, now I'm going to buff the Naga.
[263:05.41]Buff Naga.
[263:07.43]Okay.
[263:08.11]Naga is buffed.
[263:12.33]Now, I'm going in.
[263:14.79]Fuck it.
[263:15.15]Let's go.
[263:21.82]Got it.
[263:22.14]Okay.
[263:28.72]Dwarves, I think.
[263:31.76]Yeah.
[263:33.06]These are so powerful when you have a stack of them.
[263:39.19]Alright.
[263:40.09]Let's see if I can wipe this out.
[263:41.15]Holy shit.
[263:52.92]That was insane.
[263:54.30]I can't get cocky though because all it takes is...
[264:01.07]1000 damage.
[264:03.16]Good.
[264:04.80]I'm sticking.
[264:05.62]I'm gonna just... I don't know.
[264:08.28]I kind of have to just... Just fight it.
[264:14.38]It's in front of you.
[264:15.77]I'm gonna lose all the gremlins.
[264:20.61]Reinforce.
[264:28.65]wow these guys are so strong okay here come the centaurs get to go again not good
[265:05.68]Holy fuck.
[265:10.80]That was... I can taste victory.
[265:14.50]I can smell it.
[265:15.15]There's only a few things left.
[265:18.23]I'm gonna get the castle.
[265:23.17]Purple is no more.
[265:24.75]I can't go anywhere, so I'm just gonna hang out right here.
[265:34.98]This thing is very strong.
[265:38.36]I think it's like stone skin.
[265:42.18]Don't want to lose any more of you.
[265:50.88]Yeah, having this many.
[265:51.66]They're upgraded too.
[266:01.27]Can I go for a one-hit kill?
[266:02.15]What do you think?
[266:06.91]No, that was a bad idea.
[266:08.81]Oh, that was a really bad idea.
[266:10.90]That was bad bad idea This thing is so strong It's okay It's almost done Kill it
[266:35.07]Why are you so strong?
[266:36.39]The siege.
[266:40.41]The battle has been won.
[266:42.58]Almost 10,000 experience.
[267:09.31]Lost 165 gremlins, 73 gargoyles, 10 magicians, 8 genies, 2 naga Queens, 7 skeletons.
[267:25.32]You have captured an enemy artifact, the Tome of Earth Magic.
[267:29.44]This heavy book contains all spells in the School of Earth Magic.
[267:34.35]It must be equipped for those spells to be available.
[267:39.38]Expert Wisdom or Advanced Sorcery.
[267:46.38]Hmm.
[267:47.31]Bit level spells.
[267:48.19]10% more damage.
[267:58.46]Get to go again.
[267:59.10]Knowledge plus 1.
[268:00.06]Advanced Logistics.
[268:02.68]20% more movement speed.
[268:06.66]Damn.
[268:08.42]Advanced offense all hand-to-hand by 20% more damage I've claimed Mara Shen Look at this place Thank you, I appreciate it.
[268:30.36]We're decking this place out
[268:35.42]You already have a castle.
[268:37.31]You don't have a capital yet.
[268:42.21]Wait, do we have a capital?
[268:43.41]Is this thing already... What's this?
[268:45.97]Mystic Pond.
[268:48.89]Produces a small, random number of resources every week.
[268:54.64]Yeah, give it to me!
[269:00.50]I need to get in there.
[269:10.54]No recruits left, so there's Green Dragon that's available soon.
[269:14.78]I'm gonna have you defend here for a little bit.
[269:18.28]Because, I mean, I just did this.
[269:24.51]Purple probably has one more stronghold that's down here.
[269:32.99]How many skeletons did I get for that?
[269:34.15]85 skeletons.
[269:40.93]That's a lot.
[269:44.53]I'm not confident with this group, though, because I just lost so many.
[269:53.42]Maybe hire a new hero to take care of this place.
[269:56.12]I have a lot of strongholds.
[269:59.50]I have to click on this one.
[270:16.76]You stay here.
[270:17.44]I want to have somebody available in each base.
[270:23.17]Okay.
[270:29.07]Here's the book.
[270:30.57]Where can the book go?
[270:31.53]The book has to replace something.
[270:32.87]Wait, oh, it does it.
[270:40.38]Yeah, it does.
[270:41.00]Okay, so we got...
[270:44.98]This bonecruise is your archery skill by 5%.
[270:47.50]That's nothing.
[270:49.06]Bang.
[270:50.24]We now know every single Earth spell in the game.
[270:55.29]I want to know what they look like.
[270:57.61]Oh my god.
[271:00.71]What?
[271:03.61]Allow you to summon Earth elementals.
[271:05.49]Once cast, no other elemental may be summoned.
[271:09.64]This almost feels like hacks and cheat codes.
[271:15.12]Implosion.
[271:16.50]Inflicts massive damage to a single creature stack.
[271:20.93]Meteor Shower.
[271:21.89]Resurrection.
[271:24.57]This is insane.
[271:25.79]Sorrow.
[271:31.05]Well, I think that's our... I think we win.
[271:33.79]I just need to get some more here.
[271:38.56]I gotta get more units here.
[271:41.02]That was a major victory, but we suffered major losses.
[271:46.73]Let's continue the exploration down here.
[271:48.53]How much money do I got?
[271:50.74]Can I do anything?
[271:51.38]I need to get these goddamn giants.
[271:55.90]Ten, ten, ten.
[272:02.77]I'm gonna be getting a lot of income, though.
[272:17.47]I could trade the gems.
[272:18.41]Yeah, I could, but that's not very much, um... I mean, I guess it is.
[272:27.59]Gems for wood?
[272:28.41]10?
[272:28.43]20 gems!
[272:29.15]Let's get more.
[272:31.05]10 more.
[272:54.41]So I have... No, hold on.
[272:57.97]So that means 24 wood.
[273:04.17]I need 10 ore, which I don't have.
[273:10.68]What do I have?
[273:15.46]4, so I have 6.
[273:19.54]Alright.
[273:21.65]Let's get those fucking giants.
[273:28.52]Giants.
[273:29.10]150 health, 40 to 60 damage.
[273:42.76]Oh, I need gems.
[273:44.00]I can only recruit one a week.
[273:49.18]Well, time to start the collection.
[273:54.47]Oh, two per week.
[274:01.77]Let me take a look at them again.
[274:03.35]Mind Spell Immunity.
[274:06.77]They're very, very expensive.
[274:09.13]Alright, I don't need them this second.
[274:10.19]I just wanted to make sure I could get them.
[274:12.63]That leaves us with... I have 14 wood, which is enough.
[274:15.49]What's something else I want to do?
[274:16.89]No, what was the other thing I wanted to do before I left?
[274:32.84]Upgrade the cliff nest.
[274:38.72]I need... What do I need for this?
[274:43.93]Five more ore, which I have.
[274:45.69]Five... What do I miss in here?
[274:47.31]I can't afford it.
[274:52.50]Oh, okay.
[274:54.30]I do need five.
[274:55.00]I need five ore.
[274:58.72]I was looking down here for some reason.
[274:59.78]Alright, let's get some ore.
[275:01.92]What do I have to trade?
[275:04.02]Crystals.
[275:04.68]I'm gonna do an 8-5 or a 10.
[275:06.08]Did I not get... Oh, shit, right?
[275:08.88]I didn't shake the hand.
[275:30.78]Cliffnest.
[275:31.76]Thunderbirds.
[275:35.62]Golden birds.
[275:36.36]Nice.
[275:36.70]Alright, so.
[275:37.22]11, 15, 60.
[275:39.02]What's the difference?
[275:43.25]Speed?
[275:51.03]Chief.
[275:52.47]Okay.
[275:53.61]Gold birds.
[275:55.51]Lightning strike.
[275:56.23]Oh, that's the difference.
[275:56.86]Okay, cool.
[275:58.80]I think I'm in a pretty good spot.
[276:00.24]I think I'm in a pretty good spot right now.
[276:03.79]I'm pretty confident.
[276:08.95]Let's get this stuff claimed again.
[276:13.37]More gold.
[276:15.83]Get this homestead.
[276:19.55]Oh no.
[276:21.13]Don't want that.
[276:21.77]Okay, what do we got?
[276:25.98]Still the same week.
[276:29.81]Lookout Tower.
[276:30.79]I mean, I could just build it just because.
[276:33.23]But no, that's precious wood.
[276:34.41]Let's do another upgrade to this one here.
[276:42.34]Cyclops Cave.
[276:44.28]I need the Ogre Fort.
[276:45.50]20 wood!
[276:56.02]20 and 20.
[276:56.70]Two things that I don't have.
[277:10.03]I mean, it's going to wipe me out, but... Let's get eight.
[277:15.88]And then what about this?
[277:16.90]This is not a bad exchange right now.
[277:20.38]What do I need?
[277:20.92]Three.
[277:25.35]I want to be 20 and 20, right?
[277:39.66]Fuck!
[277:40.06]I need money!
[277:40.54]I don't have any favorable... No, it's all good.
[277:52.57]That was quick.
[277:58.64]We're not at the end of the week yet.
[277:59.44]I can afford it.
[278:01.58]Tax day?
[278:02.14]Tax day's coming up.
[278:02.84]Not right now.
[278:04.60]I still have a couple days.
[278:11.82]16,000 No, wrong place Upgrade the wolf ogre fort.
[278:21.07]No, I just do the regular fort from where is it here?
[278:25.75]Alright Yeah Just try to come get me now
[278:44.89]Alright, that's good.
[278:46.99]You are continuing your path.
[278:49.67]I've already done this.
[278:50.72]What do I have for, uh, points?
[278:51.72]Upgraded my points.
[278:55.82]There's the Dwarven treasury.
[278:57.32]It's been deserted.
[278:58.88]I've been to the obelisk already, but... I'm gonna take another turn.
[279:04.07]Do I have enough pieces?
[279:08.13]No.
[279:10.14]Alright.
[279:11.32]Uncharted territory for the first time.
[279:13.02]The Warrior's Tomb.
[279:14.48]Do I wish to search the tomb?
[279:16.52]I do.
[279:19.32]Oh no, that's not good.
[279:20.64]What happened?
[279:24.81]Did I just get super morale decrease?
[279:32.17]Sulphur.
[279:41.92]Very bad morale.
[279:47.12]Minus three from the warrior tomb.
[279:49.99]Dicks.
[279:55.41]Alright, what have I got?
[279:56.65]This is the last day before the new week in taxes, so let me see if I can build something.
[280:05.07]I need to spend this money.
[280:06.05]What about this new town?
[280:12.20]No, maybe I should save the money.
[280:15.44]Fountain of Fortune?
[280:20.92]Enchanted Springs?
[280:23.65]Ooh!
[280:25.97]Yeah, let's get it.
[280:28.09]It's a silver, uh, pegasi.
[280:37.35]Alright, here comes a new week.
[280:45.53]Notice how purple is, uh, painful.
[280:48.43]Weak the rabbit.
[280:50.11]Let's move you around.
[280:57.64]Uh, plus one luck for the next battle.
[281:00.12]There's another... Uh-oh.
[281:04.92]Uh, this is purple's last defense.
[281:14.39]Ammo carts.
[281:16.31]Unlimited ammunition.
[281:18.75]Should I get the ammunition one?
[281:20.01]Do I already have one of these?
[281:23.66]I don't know if I'm confident to get in there.
[281:27.40]Get the tent?
[281:27.94]I think I already have one.
[281:32.18]I'm just supposed to get it, yeah.
[281:35.68]Yeah, I've got everything now.
[281:39.56]Um, you've got several lots.
[281:41.46]Lots pack several few.
[281:46.30]It might not be a good idea.
[281:47.90]I could probably do it, but... I don't have the range, I don't think.
[281:52.48]I'm not confident.
[281:59.82]But, I do have money, and we have a ton of new recruits!
[282:10.55]You have every Earth spell.
[282:11.65]Yeah, that's true.
[282:12.29]I could just, like, Earthquake them.
[282:16.87]I should delete these.
[282:18.69]Yeah, just dismiss these idiots.
[282:21.29]Four.
[282:21.53]Yeah, just get out of here.
[282:28.90]Here we go.
[282:32.14]26,003 to get all this stuff.
[282:39.68]This is turning into another great army.
[282:41.54]Here's three giants.
[282:42.56]What does it take to upgrade the giants?
[282:46.16]25,030.
[282:46.28]I can do this.
[282:53.99]And another turn or two, I'll be able to do it.
[282:55.63]And I'll have unstoppable units.
[283:01.13]Let's just recruit everybody, just to do it.
[283:06.13]Yep.
[283:06.94]Bring them all in.
[283:08.16]Ooh, okay, hold on, wait.
[283:10.80]Skeletons.
[283:12.22]No, that's good.
[283:16.76]I'm running out of money, though.
[283:17.54]Uh-oh.
[283:25.61]Here's the taxes.
[283:27.93]What are you doing over here?
[283:31.89]He's coming for blood.
[283:33.92]I think he's going for it.
[283:35.24]I think he's going for it.
[284:01.79]I need to upgrade somebody.
[284:02.99]I have Chieftain's Wolf Riders or the Hobgoblins.
[284:12.44]No, already half hot.
[284:13.26]Wolf Pen.
[284:14.80]Thousand, five and five.
[284:15.86]I need some more wood.
[284:23.11]Terrible exchange.
[284:24.75]Awful exchange, right?
[284:25.49]This is bad.
[284:27.03]I'm gonna need five, so I have, what, two?
[284:51.63]Do I have enough money to do this?
[284:54.68]1400.
[284:55.68]Alright, they are now both raiders.
[284:58.56]I'm gonna lose the talent.
[285:05.73]I might not.
[285:06.73]I may not.
[285:07.47]I have... This is a really good defense.
[285:15.93]This game's 20 years old and it holds up really well.
[285:19.22]Yeah.
[285:21.12]It's just... It's the classic.
[285:23.76]You know?
[285:24.02]It's just a very, very, very fun game.
[285:31.66]You can go so elaborate with this game, I mean, obviously... Sorry, I keep bumping the mic.
[285:36.81]This is, I think, four players in, like, a medium-sized map.
[285:39.83]You can do extra large with eight people.
[285:42.65]And you can put it on very fucking hard.
[285:45.91]I saved, so you can look.
[285:47.69]I'll do it again.
[285:49.98]See, right now I have the difficulty on normal, like the map difficulty is normal.
[285:54.41]And then I have like the player difficulty on like... What's that, like one notch up, essentially?
[286:02.19]You can really just bring it up or down.
[286:09.91]You can make the game real fucking hard.
[286:21.43]I wonder if I should go for this.
[286:24.28]Let me just see what's down here.
[286:26.40]Alright, there's a mine.
[286:27.38]There's a couple of things.
[286:28.34]I'm just going to go outside his front door.
[286:31.88]I'm going to take everything in his front door.
[286:35.06]Would you like to recruit centaurs?
[286:38.42]14 centaurs join your army.
[286:43.20]I didn't mean that to be like a horse, but I'll take them.
[286:47.66]I had a spot for them.
[286:51.21]I'm right outside of his door!
[286:59.79]I'm just waiting out here.
[287:00.83]Alright, here comes a fight, because you look like you're coming over here.
[287:06.20]How we doing?
[287:06.68]We're alright.
[287:07.32]We got enough at least for a standoff here.
[287:12.12]Take it!
[287:12.44]I can't move anymore.
[287:13.12]I have to wait till next turn.
[287:13.96]Let's see what he does.
[287:20.22]There he comes.
[287:20.94]He's going for it.
[287:23.42]He's coming with everything he has.
[287:25.40]This is his entire army.
[287:28.08]He's pissed.
[287:30.42]We took his city, and now he's like, fuck this, I'm coming with 300 centaurs.
[287:35.60]Uh, alright.
[287:37.84]Death Ripple.
[287:41.92]No.
[287:44.06]Curse Bloodlust.
[287:45.14]Curse.
[287:50.36]Disrupting Ray?
[287:59.88]I could do Bloodlust or just Lightning Bolt.
[288:04.39]Throw Curse.
[288:08.45]Yeah.
[288:12.55]Curse the Archers.
[288:14.87]Curse the Archer.
[288:15.69]But they're just going to fly in.
[288:17.21]I think he's going to take the castle.
[288:18.37]Maybe not.
[288:20.60]Purse the archers so they don't do any damage.
[288:23.84]And then... I just gotta... I gotta sit in here.
[288:32.91]I can't go anywhere.
[288:38.31]I can't just jump out there.
[288:39.31]No.
[288:44.96]No.
[288:47.65]That's too many centaurs.
[288:49.19]Hopefully at least the archers will take care of it.
[288:52.41]Do I even have any ranged at all?
[288:54.63]I don't think I have any.
[288:57.73]Besides the towers.
[288:58.51]Slowly gonna make their way over here.
[289:06.36]I wish I could just throw an axe at you.
[289:08.74]Nooo, hurts.
[289:17.88]Okay, no, this is ranged.
[289:18.80]This is ranged.
[289:19.81]It's an axe thrower.
[289:24.03]Ugh, I don't know.
[289:25.35]Right at the front door, try to just throw.
[289:29.25]Or should I go for the archer?
[289:30.17]This is gonna be... It's not great, but... Hmm...
[289:50.30]Once she gets in a... She's gonna fly over the gate.
[290:00.75]Fuck.
[290:05.29]Come on!
[290:07.93]No!
[290:08.87]The gates are being breached.
[290:10.09]This is bad.
[290:10.65]Gates are open.
[290:13.51]Alright.
[290:14.35]It's time... I'm gonna go Bloodlust.
[290:24.03]Either Bloodlust or... Earth Magic?
[290:34.60]This is not the same person.
[290:37.82]This is a different person.
[290:39.92]Different hero.
[290:42.08]Am I out of mana?
[290:43.60]No, that's not good.
[290:45.18]Can I do anything?
[290:48.14]I'm fucked.
[290:51.31]I have to just go out and start fighting.
[290:55.26]Who do I want to try to take out first?
[291:02.42]Alright, it's not completely over yet.
[291:04.66]Not yet.
[291:06.38]Really the only real major scary thing is this guy and this guy.
[291:10.58]They're in the arches too.
[291:15.28]I gotta go in.
[291:17.96]It's 57 trees.
[291:20.22]Yeah, this is bad.
[291:22.14]Well, at least I put up a defense.
[291:27.05]I'm just gonna fly in and see if we can take out some of the centaurs.
[291:29.79]Damage, health... I mean, these things are good.
[291:33.33]They're trying to kill the Thunderbirds immediately.
[291:45.98]I could probably take out a bunch of these, though.
[291:48.07]There's so many of them.
[291:53.71]I could fly up here and just go for the archers.
[291:57.51]But I can only fly this far.
[292:05.35]See if I can make something happen.
[292:06.53]Alright, you didn't like that.
[292:10.03]Holy shit.
[292:12.01]That was not good.
[292:14.11]Alright.
[292:18.48]Just get the fuck out here.
[292:32.29]Game over.
[292:37.67]I can't hurt... I can't do anything.
[292:39.97]You can't hurt everything.
[292:42.00]Might as well just whack this thing.
[292:44.36]No.
[292:45.40]They don't stand a chance.
[292:59.86]Why do they have to piss purple off?
[293:02.90]Well, I don't mind losing this, because it's not like there's a lot here.
[293:10.60]I can get it back.
[293:12.10]Plus, dude, I'm about to go destroy his whole... his... he's only gonna have one place.
[293:17.42]He spent all of his money to get his revenge, and that's fine.
[293:24.02]I could care less.
[293:26.38]I'm standing outside his front door.
[293:33.12]I just bought this guy yesterday.
[293:39.08]See, look at this.
[293:40.54]Several few lots, pack several, pack few.
[293:43.90]I think I can get in there.
[293:49.37]And then I have this down here, and this is definitely decked out.
[293:52.09]This place has to be.
[293:54.79]I got all the best spells in the game.
[293:56.89]Let's go for it.
[293:58.43]Uh-oh.
[294:06.85]Wow, that did a lot of damage.
[294:08.36]Alright, here we go.
[294:10.32]Earth.
[294:11.72]Earth Elemental.
[294:13.98]Or Implosion.
[294:15.38]Should I implode the dragon?
[294:16.72]I'm gonna fucking implode the dragon.
[294:22.23]Excuse me.
[294:23.43]Sorry, but I'm about to kill at least two of you.
[294:31.43]That does so much damage, and two of them have been removed.
[294:36.22]That's how you can tell that this thing is fucking crazy.
[294:41.72]I'm alright with this, though.
[294:42.58]What's the damage on the... I wonder if I should buff somebody.
[294:46.78]Or should I just go in?
[294:50.57]They don't do that much damage.
[294:51.63]13 to 16, not worth it.
[294:57.52]Haste on the mage.
[294:58.98]What the hell are you doing to me?
[295:01.53]Come on, come on out the front door.
[295:02.49]I'm gonna kill the dragon before you get out here.
[295:07.89]Fucking morale.
[295:08.65]Whatever.
[295:10.33]Alright, beat him, punch him right in the face.
[295:12.03]Go for the dragons?
[295:14.17]Or should I just remove the unicorn?
[295:15.63]Go for the dragon.
[295:16.49]Everybody.
[295:18.71]Everybody focus on the dragons.
[295:19.67]Come on.
[295:20.95]Come on.
[295:24.64]Come on.
[295:27.45]I'm so glad these skeletons are just taking the damage here.
[295:30.09]They're just eating this.
[295:33.84]Thank God.
[295:34.74]They ate that whole thing.
[295:39.96]Alright, Jeannie.
[295:41.06]You gotta get one hit.
[295:42.10]That's all I ask.
[295:42.78]Hit one time.
[295:48.03]One hit!
[295:50.53]Yes.
[295:52.65]The immediate threat is not the unicorn.
[295:55.93]I think it's... Is it the unicorn?
[295:57.21]I don't know.
[295:57.69]Is it the... The Medusas, probably?
[296:00.41]Got it.
[296:06.60]Alright, I gotta get the Gargoyles up front.
[296:16.24]You did... That was a big mistake.
[296:23.02]Front door not open.
[296:28.74]Alright, let's implode.
[296:32.14]Who's more dangerous, you think?
[296:39.38]Let's see.
[296:40.90]Three to seven.
[296:42.75]Two to three.
[296:43.47]Uh, let's... I'm just gonna implode the, uh... The archers.
[296:57.53]I have taken your castle!
[296:59.71]It's mine!
[297:01.69]With minimal loss!
[297:14.90]Overkill.
[297:15.56]I wanted to, like, assert my dominance here.
[297:19.51]Genie should end this in one hit.
[297:26.14]Nimbus versus the Gold Dragons.
[297:30.38]Didn't... I lost a bunch of skeletons, but... There we go.
[297:34.50]Let's see how decked out this place is.
[297:38.64]Holy shit.
[297:44.25]Hey, thanks.
[297:45.35]Thanks for, like, the decked out house.
[297:48.35]Castle.

[298:03.66]Yeah, thanks for the house.
[298:05.72]And thanks for the new hero that I'm going to have that is going to be decked out.
[298:11.03]Who's it going to be?
[298:14.59]Alchemist or Heretic?
[298:17.79]Probably the Heretic.
[298:23.60]So I don't care if I lost that place.
[298:29.03]Basic pathfinding has been found out.
[298:31.53]Curses morale.
[298:35.15]Finally, I get some more stuff to claim.
[298:38.26]Two wood a day, thank God.
[298:42.30]Now let's get another hero.

[301:28.91]Let me give the... Come here.
[301:39.80]That's his only force.
[301:41.38]He's just taking it all over the world.
[301:44.43]Okay.
[301:45.17]I want... I'm sending you... Hold on.
[301:49.21]Let me look at this.
[301:53.39]You get out of here for a minute.
[301:58.37]I need to look.
[301:58.97]Let's see.
[302:01.19]What's better?
[302:12.31]Send Nimbus home to restock.
[302:14.31]It just takes so long.
[302:15.21]I'm on the other side of the world at this point.
[302:20.72]It's empty now.
[302:21.62]He just, he's leaving every castle empty.
[302:25.13]I have like five castles and like four, the one he attacks is the one that doesn't have fucking things in it.
[302:35.35]Everything else, look it, everywhere else has stuff.
[302:43.64]He's just hanging out over here.
[302:46.70]You're a pain in my ass.
[302:50.17]Maybe we should just both go get him.
[302:53.65]Meet him on the open field.
[302:56.31]Not yet.
[302:56.77]I need to, like, have the correct... Shit.
[303:03.01]Let's... I'm gonna recruit all these fucking people.
[303:07.88]Here we go.
[303:08.38]Alright.
[303:09.98]Bang.
[303:13.06]93 Centaur Captains.
[303:15.08]That's really good.
[303:17.36]Let me see what you got on you.
[303:20.68]You got, like, this... I'm just gonna send you to, like, your death.
[303:25.84]I definitely want the dragon.
[303:29.11]And the centaur captains.
[303:32.83]It's the imps.
[303:33.41]The imps are fucking this whole thing up.
[303:38.85]Alright, come here.
[303:39.57]I'm dumping the imps.
[303:41.71]We're both going up there.
[303:53.92]You guys just stay here.
[303:56.78]93 captains.
[304:01.13]And what do we have here?
[304:03.43]Centaurs... I'm gonna trade him the centaur captains.
[304:11.83]So he has 93 captains, 16 naga Queens.
[304:19.04]Should I trade out the skeletons for the dragon?
[304:23.44]Skeletons for the dragon or skeletons for the pegasus?
[304:33.64]I feel like I really want the pegasus though, but what do I give up?
[304:36.92]The golems?
[304:39.64]Treants are good.
[304:46.76]Golems are a good wall though, but now I have the centaur captains.
[304:49.46]Wait, hold on, let me look.
[304:51.74]Damage 2 to 3.
[304:52.68]Health 10, 12.
[304:56.80]I mean, they're not that much... They're not that great.
[305:04.60]It's not worth using a slot for one unit?
[305:07.16]No, but... I mean, it's got 250 health.
[305:11.22]There are 93 centaur captains in here.
[305:14.70]And they all have 10 health.
[305:16.34]You know what I mean?
[305:16.80]Like, I need like 2 or 3 dragons.
[305:19.76]And it's immune to spells.
[305:33.21]There's 93 of them, though.
[305:34.13]The archers, too, would be good.
[305:35.61]They have pretty good damage.
[305:46.44]This is an unbelievable unit.
[305:48.86]This is an unbelievable unit.
[305:49.92]I think the gargoyle's probably for the... trance?
[306:10.15]Because this, we need, we got range here.
[306:17.91]Send in Khalid to soften him up.
[306:22.15]Just, we're going to go together.
[306:23.89]Alright, yeah, we're going to send, we're going to send in like this little imp first.
[306:32.46]He's going to take out like four, like he's going to take out a bunch of them.
[306:35.18]And then I'm going to do like, dad's going to come in and clean it up.
[306:40.60]I think that's good as it is.
[306:48.78]Alright.
[306:50.60]Out of money.
[306:52.14]I'm ready for the actual purple battle because then these... Look, these castles are empty.
[306:57.72]He's got nobody there.
[306:59.16]Not one person.
[307:00.55]Not one person.
[307:01.85]He's just a riding castle.
[307:03.81]He's riding around with a castle on his back.
[307:07.19]It's time.
[307:11.26]Soften him up.
[307:12.50]Let's go.
[307:12.94]Uh-oh.
[307:34.21]Blue's coming in.
[307:34.77]Here we go.
[307:38.07]He's coming down here.
[307:43.84]This is it for purple.
[307:44.74]It is.
[307:45.00]Because look, blue's coming in to take this free castle, and then this is it.
[307:50.16]Purple will be wiped out from the game.
[307:54.57]Purple is not going to exist anymore after this.
[307:57.59]There's going to be three people left.
[307:59.49]Do you have any of this shit?
[308:04.07]I don't think he even has this.
[308:05.88]It's just fine to take one.
[308:08.88]Wait, hold on.
[308:09.30]Do you have...
[308:14.09]Alright, just soften him up.
[308:15.51]He'll be good.
[308:18.43]I'm going in.
[308:18.85]Alright, I have, like, these two booger enemies.
[308:26.77]I'm going to hang out back here just for a minute.
[308:28.43]Because, like, I... What if he doesn't... Somebody's going to come from the other side and take this castle.
[308:36.57]Alright, there goes that one.
[308:41.81]Wait, there's a...
[308:44.28]Energy elemental growth.
[308:45.36]Is that purple?
[308:48.90]What the fuck are you doing over here?
[308:50.76]Where does purple have another castle?
[308:52.16]Down here?
[308:52.66]No, impossible.
[308:53.70]Alright, go fucking... go get him.
[309:06.12]How you doing?
[309:08.36]You good?
[309:12.79]He's not gonna come back.
[309:18.17]I'm creeping up.
[309:19.51]Let's go.
[309:19.87]Blue is down.
[309:27.40]Brown has just been in the top left.
[309:30.58]There's the taxes.
[309:33.67]Okay.
[309:34.67]You dick.
[309:37.41]Save the game.
[309:38.19]Go get him.
[309:40.91]Purple does not have anything left.
[309:49.59]Alright, let's go.

[310:44.72]This wasn't even worth doing.
[310:45.90]I can't soften him up.
[310:46.70]He's got like about 500 people.
[310:54.55]It's because he's in the castle too.

[312:55.29]One-way entrance.
[312:56.29]Where does that monolith exit end up?
[313:04.33]I can teleport?
[313:05.09]I have teleport?
[313:10.11]Oh, this is all Earth!
[313:11.35]Town portal!
[313:14.35]The nearest friendly town.
[313:15.99]The town must be unoccupied.
[313:17.63]Oh my god.
[313:28.77]View Earth!
[313:31.61]I mean, alright, hold on.
[313:32.61]This is important.
[313:36.64]You... Alright, I gotta just... New turn.
[313:42.52]I gotta get everybody in buildings.
[313:49.86]Because I don't want to teleport you here because you're right next to it.
[313:56.24]Fuck.
[313:57.96]Ugh.
[313:58.24]Ugh.
[314:00.91]Exit to the one that's orange up here.
[314:02.49]Yeah, but that I don't want to be up here Alright, I gotta get a plan The plan is I need to get you in this building Nobody attack me, please
[314:29.37]Okay.
[314:30.89]You have to get in here.
[314:33.05]First of all, let's get this correct.
[314:37.13]Three dragons.
[314:40.09]Sixty.
[314:42.06]Okay.
[314:43.16]I've got a little group of, like, idiots.
[314:49.32]I'm gonna stack them all.
[314:54.14]So do I just... What do you have?
[314:56.86]Yeah, just bring them all back.
[314:59.52]Bring them all back.
[315:05.73]Because I need to... Come here.
[315:14.92]There we go.
[315:20.60]123, 19...
[315:26.04]Now you get the fuck back in here.
[315:27.92]Like that.
[315:28.40]I know.
[315:31.74]I know.
[315:35.28]You might as well delete the skeletons.
[315:47.07]Alright.
[315:49.23]44 archers.
[315:49.75]I need to think about this for a second.
[315:53.55]You've got
[315:57.65]Pegasus are really good.
[316:03.61]Maybe trade the Iron Golems at this point.
[316:07.10]So now I can teleport to the nearest town, which is here, I think.
[316:12.34]Because I get in here and I remove this hero from the town, right?
[316:26.32]Actually, no, I don't want him to go here.
[316:28.00]There's nothing here worth taking.
[316:33.96]The nearest town is the one you're at.
[316:35.88]Yeah, but it didn't say that as long as this town must be unoccupied.
[316:42.64]Teleports are here to the nearest friendly town.
[316:44.20]The town must be unoccupied.
[316:45.54]So if a town is occupied, will it take me to the next one?
[316:47.64]That's not how it works.
[316:51.92]Will that work?
[316:52.40]Yeah, you can just take a hero out, right?
[316:57.77]So I want to go here because this is a lot.
[316:59.71]Yeah, I got to get up here.
[317:00.63]Look at all these recruits.
[317:03.47]Alright.
[317:03.73]So first action of teleportation is this.
[317:10.18]We're going up here.
[317:12.74]There's giants here too.
[317:14.54]Alright.
[317:15.32]I got to fucking think about this shit.
[317:19.31]You...
[317:24.31]Okay.
[317:25.61]Will you go into this town?
[317:27.61]This one is also occupied.
[317:28.79]They all are, right?
[317:31.47]Unoccupied.
[317:32.45]Occupied.
[317:33.34]Occupied.
[317:35.00]Cast a spell.
[317:38.28]Town portal.
[317:42.46]Stop.
[317:42.62]Wait a minute.
[317:43.18]Take the units out too.
[317:44.04]Okay.
[317:52.71]I'm out.
[317:56.61]Spell.
[317:57.33]Town portal.
[317:59.33]Here we go.
[318:02.03]Save it?
[318:06.81]Alright, town portal.
[318:08.93]Here we go.
[318:12.50]What?!
[318:19.22]Too tired.
[318:20.38]Oh, he's coming down!
[318:21.24]He's ignoring me, okay.
[318:24.86]Town portal.
[318:26.63]Do you want to teleport to the Emerald Moor?
[318:28.79]Which one is that?
[318:29.71]No, I don't want to teleport here.
[318:31.41]God damn it.
[318:34.11]Do I actually have to go all the way over here?
[318:39.76]I have to actually travel that far?
[318:49.06]Shit.
[318:52.54]Put a hero in front of the town?
[318:57.29]You mean like... Wait, what is this?
[319:01.73]One... Lots and lots.
[319:10.26]I could get it right now.
[319:16.26]So you said, what are you saying?
[319:17.10]If I go in here, and I go like this?
[319:18.78]Let's see what happens.
[319:21.39]Okay, so he's selected.
[319:29.98]Nearest town occupied.
[319:31.02]Spell failed.
[319:31.78]Yeah.
[319:32.30]Unfortunately.
[319:34.66]Alright.
[319:35.22]I'm ready to start doing this shit again.
[319:44.75]Golems.
[319:45.51]I kind of want the dragons.
[319:48.13]But I wonder if I just replace the dragons with golems.
[319:54.76]I got three of them now.
[319:55.86]That's a lot of health.
[319:58.89]And then go up and take the town.
[320:03.48]Bring the archers with me probably too.
[320:05.10]So I need... Archers.
[320:15.13]Who doesn't need to come on this trip?
[320:20.37]Leave the treants...
[320:27.63]The golems of a pegasus.
[320:29.54]I think I'll be able to get this town up there.
[320:34.46]Health 30.
[320:36.00]Health 35.
[320:36.94]Damage, they're 45.
[320:39.22]They're both really good.
[320:45.25]The unicorns are insane, too.
[320:48.71]I only have so many slots.
[320:50.05]Alright, I'll keep this here for now.
[320:56.27]I'm gonna go take that town back.
[321:06.64]Purple is going to turn around, and that's fine.
[321:08.94]Whatever.
[321:12.98]Get back up here.
[321:17.74]Now the question is... Upgrade the type to get to Titans.
[321:24.93]Yes.
[321:28.87]I can now have Titans.
[321:38.95]I have lots to recruit.
[321:41.51]This is with Silver Wing.
[321:43.43]Silver Wing is down there.
[321:44.48]Okay.
[321:47.48]So.
[321:49.22]I'm going to recruit... a bunch of stuff!
[321:52.30]Well, I can only do that many.
[321:55.84]You just go back in here.
[321:57.62]Because, like, there's no reason for you to be out here anymore.
[322:01.59]Uh, go up there.
[322:02.43]There's a Titan.
[322:10.32]You can just take the Iron Golems.
[322:11.54]You're going to be just hanging out here anyways.
[322:15.50]Titan has ranged attacks.
[322:17.44]Yeah, and I'm going to upgrade the other ones that I have too.
[322:22.92]Well, I cannot.
[322:25.83]I'm out of money.
[322:28.09]Just hang out there for now.
[322:30.93]Okay, everybody relax.
[322:34.11]Let's go.
[322:45.96]Okay, you are down here now.
[322:49.96]Where are you going?
[322:50.56]Uh-oh.
[323:02.11]This city sucks.
[323:10.40]This city is gonna fall.
[323:12.12]It just has like 200 little trolls.
[323:18.26]Maybe he's not going to come that far.
[323:19.34]It's going to take him a couple turns.
[323:21.30]He's not going to take this one.
[323:22.92]That's for sure.
[323:23.48]Alright.
[323:26.70]Give me back my fucking town, please.
[323:39.24]Oh my god.
[323:39.98]Can I make more recruits?
[323:45.06]No, stop, stop.

[323:56.79]He ain't going to make it.
[324:05.19]Here comes Brown, finally.
[324:06.48]Brown's making his way over here now.
[324:12.42]Give me this.

[328:39.60]19, 18, 40.
[328:40.14]Okay.
[328:41.02]This is pretty good.
[328:42.60]I can't buy anything else.
[328:43.78]I don't have any money.
[328:45.64]All I can do now is hope and pray.
[328:50.37]Because now I can go back.
[328:53.37]Let's see.
[328:53.67]What we got down here?
[328:54.97]We've got a bunch of... We've got so many units to buy.
[328:58.53]There's so many that I'm getting overwhelmed by the amount of units that I can purchase.
[329:06.74]I need another day to go buy.
[329:10.29]I have a lot of sulfur, though.
[329:12.47]Can I get a good exchange on sulfur?
[329:24.60]Not really.
[329:30.58]That's a pretty bad exchange.
[329:32.10]No.
[329:38.62]Although, I can, I mean, I could... I think it's time to take you.
[329:43.56]I gotta make the journey... Back.
[329:51.54]I can get two more dragons.
[329:53.37]I think five dragons.
[329:55.43]Here's the plan.
[329:56.53]Five dragons.
[329:58.99]Yeah, he's just like running back and forth like on a route.
[330:01.61]Yeah, okay, I'm gonna get two more dragons.
[330:07.71]Because it's a new week, I'm going to get five gold dragons.
[330:11.37]And now I'm just going to get some money.
[330:14.55]I'm protected.
[330:15.17]At least enough where no one's going to kill me.
[330:17.07]I'm protected.
[330:17.85]Completely.
[330:20.50]Here he comes.
[330:22.48]Stupid fucking taxes.
[330:23.54]There he is.
[330:24.58]Here he comes.
[330:25.94]He's coming in.
[330:26.34]I gotta be ready.
[330:28.12]He's coming in.
[330:30.06]This is my... Guys, this is the main city.
[330:33.43]So... If this falls, it's going to be really sad.
[330:44.99]What do I need for this?
[330:49.01]I need the library.
[330:49.83]I don't have a fucking library.
[330:51.45]Why did I not build a library?
[331:05.54]Seven titans.
[331:15.90]Seven goddamn titans.
[331:17.18]Am I gonna lose with seven titans?
[331:24.13]He didn't have like... I have seven fucking titans.
[331:30.61]I feel like I've just been playing against purple this whole game while the other two just build up their resources forever.
[331:37.89]Just give me my damn dragon.
[331:39.61]Here we go.
[331:40.49]If we lose, we lose.
[331:41.63]Whatever.
[331:49.18]Here he comes.
[331:49.58]Okay, this is it.
[331:54.78]I got, like, mines and shit.
[331:57.32]Let's go.
[331:57.71]What do we got?
[332:00.71]Wizard.
[332:01.29]Buff the Titan.
[332:03.73]Pick up the spells.
[332:04.43]Force Field.
[332:04.93]Animate the dead.
[332:05.67]Destroy undead.
[332:07.95]Lightning Bolt.
[332:08.57]How much spell?
[332:08.99]Do I have any points?
[332:10.18]80 points.
[332:10.94]Versus 50.
[332:14.22]That's so many, but I can do it.
[332:18.41]I'm thinking... Put a curse on their Archer or a curse on their Pegasus.
[332:33.12]The Pegasus is gonna fly right over.
[332:34.61]A Pegasus has to die.
[332:35.69]Okay, curse on the Archer.
[332:48.36]And then I'm gonna buff... I'm gonna buff the Titan.
[332:53.82]All in on Titan.
[332:56.49]Here we go.
[333:00.29]Yes!
[333:00.93]Okay, that's... For being that far away, that's very, very good.
[333:06.27]That is exceptionally good.
[333:07.99]I ain't moving anybody.
[333:13.57]Step on the mine.
[333:16.43]Idiot.
[333:22.23]How many archers are here?
[333:23.37]I can't tell.
[333:24.63]This is going to be all in on Titan.
[333:29.71]No, don't move.
[333:31.76]Let them hurt themselves.
[333:37.92]That hurts so much.
[333:40.16]That hurts so much.
[333:41.56]Oh my god, that sucked.
[333:47.18]Do I stand at the front door?
[333:48.22]I think I have to stand at the front door.
[333:52.73]They're gonna kill him.
[333:55.59]They can't get in yet, but I'm gonna get at the front door.
[333:58.79]I'm going right here.
[333:59.61]Okay, now it's the... the Magi.
[334:03.79]I just gotta go for the archers.
[334:06.85]29... how many treants?
[334:09.64]70 fucking 3 treants.
[334:10.46]73!
[334:10.48]I'm never gonna kill 73 of these.
[334:23.36]Who's up?
[334:25.38]Genie.
[334:26.49]Titan.
[334:26.95]All in.
[334:30.10]Cross the map.
[334:31.04]No.
[334:45.14]Holy shit, that was fucking insane.
[334:47.62]I just killed a hundred.
[334:49.50]I killed almost one fucking hundred of them.
[334:52.14]Alright, all in on Titan.
[334:53.50]That's all that matters.
[334:58.64]I wonder, do I fly you out here just to be a pain in the ass?
[335:02.02]Or not yet.
[335:06.68]I think I'm gonna curse the... I'm gonna curse the Pegasus.
[335:13.76]Because this next turn, she's flying over.
[335:18.21]She's going to fly over this next turn.
[335:29.69]Fly the gargoyle over the arches?
[335:31.39]Yeah.
[335:38.41]Last one.
[335:39.13]Forcefield.
[335:42.43]I don't know.
[335:43.31]I'm scared.
[335:43.57]What does the 4th skill do?
[335:44.49]I've never used it.
[335:49.63]I'm gonna play... I'm gonna just do it smart.
[335:50.91]Here we go.
[335:53.35]These two are now worthless.
[335:55.93]Now?
[335:59.17]I'm going in.
[336:00.11]This is it.
[336:05.77]These are my two strongest units.
[336:06.90]It's fine.
[336:11.09]Pegasus is gonna be dead.
[336:13.79]Almost left.
[336:15.04]Nine Pegasus die.
[336:17.38]Yep, that was a good distraction.
[336:19.30]I'm okay with this.
[336:20.82]He's not coming in now.
[336:23.34]Oh shit, he's in.
[336:25.62]Not the genie!
[336:28.38]This is bad.
[336:43.50]Destroy undead?
[336:44.38]I'll give it a try.
[336:49.40]How many are left?
[336:49.96]I can't tell.
[336:51.20]Is it five?
[336:51.68]Fuck.
[337:06.91]I can only shoot.
[337:07.73]Like, the...
[337:10.88]No, no, what are you doing?
[337:15.36]I thought it was gonna... What?
[337:18.06]I thought it was a ranged.
[337:21.14]It's all in on the goddamn Titan.
[337:23.64]It's still possible.
[337:26.64]Destroy undead.
[337:32.42]It fucking barely did shit.
[337:34.81]All in on Titan.
[337:49.70]How many are fucking left?!
[337:56.75]What?!
[337:59.73]Oh my god, there's too many of them!
[338:02.63]There's so many of them!
[338:06.33]Are you trying to tell me that seven fucking upgraded titans cannot kill a fucking pegasus?!
[338:13.02]You eat my fucking... I'm actually upset right now.
[338:21.44]There's only 15 of you!
[338:32.32]Get over here.
[338:34.93]Don't step on a landmine!
[338:42.33]Come on, Titan!
[338:43.37]I know you can do this.
[338:45.67]I'm fucking certain you can do it.
[338:47.59]You can do it!
[338:48.13]You can do it!
[338:48.61]Stay alive!
[338:49.11]Stay alive!
[338:49.51]You can do it!
[338:49.89]You can do it!
[338:50.25]You can do it!
[338:52.18]Ehh!
[338:54.30]Stop!
[338:55.38]No!
[338:56.48]This is just too fucking- God damn, I lost everything.
[339:11.05]The army was just so enormous!
[339:13.53]Whatever, we have a new home now.
[339:19.94]God damn it.
[339:22.56]I mean, I've got like five fucking thousand enemies.
[339:25.59]Ugh, fuck.
[339:33.13]Who do I have down here?
[339:43.34]Who's even up here?
[339:44.16]I gotta go- okay, I've gotta bring you up here and grab this shit.
[339:54.01]Let me go in here.
[339:54.65]I need... I'm going to get... I can get five... It doesn't matter how many dragons I have.
[340:07.56]Gold dragons.
[340:10.20]Five gold dragons.
[340:16.93]Could I go up there and kill them now that it's softened?
[340:18.97]I don't know.
[340:26.91]I mean, look, it's gonna take me fucking like a week to get back over there.
[340:33.18]There's nothing in there.
[340:34.06]He's just running around.
[340:37.02]This dude just put a thousand people on one guy and has just been walking around in circles.
[340:45.33]That's what I should have done from the very beginning.
[340:46.73]I shouldn't have even bought any more houses.
[340:48.03]Oh yeah, he has access to make titans now.
[340:54.96]Why would I even take Elsa's castle for any reason?
[340:59.06]Just put 5,000 people on one guy.
[341:01.12]What was I thinking?
[341:06.39]He's gonna come take this now.
[341:07.43]I can't even upgrade this.
[341:14.38]I don't have any money.
[341:16.78]What was I thinking?
[341:22.10]Well, I can teleport, but if I teleport, I can only teleport here.
[341:26.16]We've tested that like three times.
[341:33.04]I mean, I could just try to go and retake it.
[341:38.53]What's up there?
[341:39.09]Alright, I'm taking the captains.
[341:43.97]I'm taking the archers.
[341:46.51]We're going to get some more.
[341:47.47]I'm going to get... Pegasus.
[341:50.64]Let's just put everybody on here.
[341:53.21]I'm gonna go through and recruit.
[341:58.59]So, when I... On the way back up, I'll fill this up.
[342:03.79]I probably should leave... What are these?
[342:05.57]Health 20... No, these are better.
[342:07.17]I need money.
[342:16.30]I just need money.
[342:17.92]Like, very, very badly.
[342:19.14]Like, so bad.
[342:25.99]Alright, well, here comes another one.
[342:27.13]Alright.
[342:28.73]8,000 gold is all I have.
[342:32.31]Uh... This is not enough.
[342:54.43]there are like a hundred I guess I could get like 70 archers and like 180 200 something centaurs you sent out your mage to melee I didn't mean to because that would mean I have let's see
[343:24.03]This is just a lost cause here at this point, that one.
[343:27.97]Go through the red portal and just use the town portal.
[343:33.23]Yeah, but if I go through the red portal, don't I just end up right here?
[343:35.99]Or do I end up here?
[343:41.94]Which one do I go through?
[343:48.46]And then use the town portal to get to like here.
[343:51.32]But then I still have to go all the way across here.
[343:54.92]If I want to take it.
[343:56.86]I want to stop here and grab that first.
[343:58.75]Because, I mean, I don't have enough enemies.
[344:01.75]I definitely don't have enough to take that on.
[344:10.14]Because I can't take any of this shit.
[344:11.42]So, I'm just going to go with this.
[344:13.70]I'm going to go recruit.
[344:16.12]And see if I can get anything done.
[344:24.70]Because there's a ton up here.
[344:26.88]No, no.
[344:29.00]Just give me the... Give me archers.
[344:33.81]Give me these.
[344:34.33]Because I can... That's a lot of archers to have.
[344:41.03]How many pegasus do I have on this guy?
[344:43.76]Pegasus and unicorns.
[344:44.82]Alright, yeah.
[344:45.20]Just... I'm making a pit stop.
[344:46.96]Right up here.
[344:48.50]And then I'm going to walk up here.
[345:01.45]Go through the portal?
[345:02.77]Well, if I go through the portal, I'm gonna have to teleport back to here anyways.
[345:05.97]I'm going up here.
[345:19.46]This'll put me at least a hundred... plus.
[345:30.90]What do I have for points right now?
[345:36.54]Okay, I'm maxed out.
[345:37.40]That's good.
[345:39.92]Back up again to recruit more.
[345:43.55]Just keep time going.
[346:01.07]No, no.
[346:01.35]Go in the building.
[346:04.57]Oh, for the love of God.
[346:09.46]Alright.
[346:10.04]This is where we do it.
[346:12.82]So, I'm going to report right change out.
[346:14.42]Maybe the mages?
[346:15.66]No, I need that.
[346:16.22]They're ranged too.
[346:16.86]29. 29.
[346:35.36]I don't have that.
[346:35.96]I can't upgrade those.
[346:36.88]Can I upgrade these?
[346:38.20]I can make this a capital.
[346:49.69]And... Alright, so that's 141.
[346:50.89]29 Pegasus.
[346:51.13]16 Queens.
[346:51.29]5 Gold Dragons.
[347:03.77]Who do we leave behind here?
[347:08.09]Or do we just stack the ranged instead of the golems?
[347:13.67]There's a lot.
[347:21.30]There's a decent amount here.
[347:28.72]Maybe the genies.
[347:37.36]18 to 22, 110.
[347:38.08]Versus, like, just not enough of them, though.
[347:51.71]They had a too high value.
[347:53.49]I think I could probably get away with this, and then make another person here.
[347:56.39]I'm gonna try with this.
[348:03.04]I think this is good.
[348:09.84]Maybe I'll... Yeah.
[348:11.63]I do need more range.
[348:12.55]I need more, like, just picking people off.
[348:16.29]That means one, two... Yeah, 141 centaurs.
[348:25.02]Alright.
[348:27.34]This is like the last hurrah here.
[348:29.06]If I can't make this done.
[348:34.72]I think this is gonna be good.
[348:37.71]I got... This is it.
[348:38.97]I'm going for it.
[348:44.79]Give me a damn boat.
[348:46.93]I'm going back.
[348:47.69]I'm not... I mean, this is free, but I don't want it.
[348:51.39]Look at all this.
[349:01.98]Get in the boat.
[349:02.58]I'm going up here.
[349:06.60]I'm not close enough to summon one yet.
[349:14.37]I'm going back to take my home back.
[349:19.34]There you are.
[349:19.94]Are you going to meet me out on the open field?
[349:22.28]Is this what this is?
[349:23.78]Lot's horde.
[349:25.36]Several.
[349:25.82]He, look it.
[349:26.36]He kind of replaced all his shit.
[349:30.02]Did he leave anything in here?
[349:31.72]He kind of didn't.
[349:32.39]I think he might have spread himself out a little too much.
[349:34.45]Oh, that's Luna.
[349:35.61]What happened to Ares?
[349:36.23]Fuck.
[349:39.29]He stole my shit.
[349:40.71]And here he comes.
[349:41.31]For this one.
[349:43.71]I'm fucked.
[349:55.46]I am so fucked.
[350:02.42]Teleport home?
[350:03.18]I'll end up over here.
[350:04.80]This is the closest one.
[350:12.81]He's just in here.
[350:17.69]See, what happened was, early, I just was learning how to play the game again.
[350:22.05]And I, like, bled myself out so hard.
[350:24.23]This is gonna be really hard to come back, I think.
[350:27.41]I'm gonna go for it, though.
[350:28.23]We'll try.
[350:28.57]Uh, summon boat.
[350:33.84]I'm gonna go for it.
[350:39.72]Whatever, it's like a thousand gold.
[350:50.43]Just give me a damn ball.
[351:09.33]Here they come.
[351:12.17]Coming to take my castle.
[351:15.79]They're just gonna take it.
[351:18.19]Nothing I can do about it.
[351:20.21]I'm so far behind at this point.
[351:23.62]That if this... I'm gonna be screwed.
[351:30.92]What can I do?
[351:31.42]Um... Magic arrow, try to kill... Let's try to kill some centaurs.
[351:35.40]That's really all I can do.
[351:42.25]Where did they get in?
[351:49.35]Oh, this is already broken.
[351:50.33]Fuck.
[352:03.35]Fight to the very end.
[352:04.50]Um, yeah, that was... That person just killed a hundred, almost two hundred gremlins in one hit.
[352:10.94]Yeah, this is unbeatable.
[352:22.98]Can I shoot it at, like, myself?
[352:36.93]Just take it.
[352:38.93]Take it.
[352:40.01]Run around in a circle with you of five million.
[352:43.66]Why would you do that?
[352:46.78]That was BM.
[352:47.32]I just got fucking BM'd.
[352:54.81]That just got roped in Hearthstone.
[352:56.41]Oh, thanks.
[353:01.60]I had a shot there, like an hour ago.
[353:05.80]It's like six hours and I fucking had it too.
[353:11.60]And they're both up here.
[353:12.60]I'm screwed.
[353:14.90]They're using my own men against me.
[353:26.14]If I meet you on the open field, I could probably take you.
[353:32.27]Is there a nobody?
[353:53.74]I can do it.
[353:54.34]I could probably take him.
[354:27.32]Damn, I have to do another goddamn fucking turn.
[354:40.73]I need to take out the other person down here and, like, go this way.
[354:46.38]The only way this works is if, like, somebody else is doing shit down here.
[354:50.16]And I, like, I have to wrap around.
[354:52.10]I have to.
[354:58.52]That's not a bad crew here.
[354:59.99]Although I probably would rather have... No, this is alright.
[355:14.89]Because there's a bunch of territory over here.
[355:16.65]I'm going to go this way.
[355:19.67]No one's coming down here.
[355:26.24]Give me this shit back.
[355:27.32]It's mine.
[355:31.45]Alright, come and get me.
[355:44.03]Head over here.
[355:46.33]Let's go Sears Hut.
[355:57.10]Halflings and trolls.
[355:58.12]I don't have that.
[355:58.68]I'm sorry.
[356:00.22]Take the Mercury.
[356:03.60]You... Take back our city, please.
[356:09.56]You can get it.
[356:10.12]Oh, you fucking... No, you... Oh, you really just stacked it up.
[356:16.16]You knew I was coming.
[356:18.74]Pack lots, few, few, several, several lots.
[356:22.77]I can do it.
[356:23.37]And I'm taking my fucking home back.
[356:24.55]And I'm gonna fucking upgrade everybody.
[356:34.93]I have a lot.
[356:36.33]This is a really, like, decent.
[356:37.77]I've got dragons.
[356:48.91]He's coming back down.
[356:49.87]Alright, lots of those mages.
[356:54.13]Several few.
[356:55.45]He's got titans.
[356:58.71]Give me back my fucking house.
[357:01.27]It's mine.
[357:02.78]Give it to me.
[357:17.75]Let's do it.
[357:19.65]Implode.
[357:23.09]Implode on that titan.
[357:28.66]Should I fly the fucking dragon in?
[357:29.94]These are my titans.
[357:38.89]Dragons should just completely just obliterate the uh...
[357:48.30]Probably the Titan.
[357:50.50]Or these mages.
[357:51.32]How many mages do we have?
[358:01.81]32 of these mages back here.
[358:05.11]Obliterate mages?
[358:09.35]Yeah, not yet.
[358:10.03]Not yet.
[358:14.76]I can't buff the dragon?
[358:19.94]Why not?
[358:25.39]Oh, immune to spells, right.
[358:27.73]Okay.
[358:41.25]Kill the genies.
[358:50.35]Titan's dead.
[358:52.13]Titan's down.
[358:52.75]Genie next.
[358:54.37]Genie's almost dead.
[359:00.63]I'm going in.
[359:12.24]I'm flying in.
[359:13.23]Taking out the elders.
[359:14.51]Or the genies.
[359:16.71]Elders.
[359:17.71]Get in there.
[359:20.00]Eld is dead.
[359:21.92]I get to go twice.
[359:22.62]Genie, dead.
[359:30.79]Dragon.
[359:32.25]Obliterate.
[359:38.37]Genie.
[359:39.95]Buff.
[359:41.15]Pegasus.
[359:44.83]Pegasus.
[359:46.49]Attack.
[360:05.27]I got my house back.
[360:07.69]I've got my home back.
[360:10.35]My home is returned to me!
[360:12.07]I get it back and then I'm gonna stack and I'm going hunting.
[360:24.31]Come on out here.
[360:29.21]I only lost a few people.
[360:32.68]Archers, some pegasi,
[360:37.32]Give me my goddamn house back.
[360:42.00]Alright.
[360:44.00]Back in business.
[360:50.07]Artifact merchant.
[360:58.25]Too bad.
[360:59.03]I have no growth here.
[360:59.93]He already used it.
[361:08.33]Now the question is... Let's keep looking over here.
[361:12.01]I got that already.
[361:13.45]This way.
[361:19.50]Now I start... This is where the stack begins.
[361:24.10]I'm gonna stack genies.
[361:26.62]And mages, by the way.
[361:30.45]I got elders now.
[361:32.93]Just get in here and hang out.
[361:42.42]This is redemption here.
[361:48.60]Hold on.
[361:49.14]I want to pick that up.
[361:52.24]Give me this.
[361:52.78]Alright.
[361:57.47]Here we go.
[362:05.63]He's coming back!
[362:06.37]He's coming back!
[362:08.86]He's saying to himself, oh, how dare you!
[362:11.46]Horde, horde, lots, pack, horde, pack!
[362:17.30]He's coming back!
[362:19.92]Open field?
[362:21.14]Can I take him in an open field?
[362:22.64]What do you think?
[362:32.53]Back, back, back!
[362:34.19]Into the castle, into the castle!
[362:42.99]Oh, fuck.
[362:43.29]I don't know what to do.
[362:45.41]I'm freaking out.
[362:46.43]Alright.
[363:08.48]Morale increase.
[363:10.07]Witch hut.
[363:11.23]You just slowly acquire stuff.
[363:15.83]Stables.
[363:16.49]Hut of the Magi.
[363:17.31]He tells you places near and far.
[363:21.09]We're gonna get some more reveal on the maps.
[363:23.01]We already did it.
[363:28.43]Bring in the breastplate stretcher!
[363:31.55]Sir, I don't know what that is.
[363:32.65]The breastplate stretcher!
[363:35.55]I'm fucking getting tired.
[363:44.85]I'm ready.
[363:45.77]I'm kind of scared.
[363:46.93]Okay, I'm going to tell you something.
[363:48.25]If I lose here... If Cinderella's castle goes down, I'm fucked.
[363:55.98]I'm not going to be able to win this game.
[363:58.24]This is it.
[363:59.08]He's coming for me.
[363:59.74]This is the battle.
[364:04.14]I can't recruit anybody.
[364:05.06]There's nothing else to do.
[364:05.90]I can do Mage Guild level 5.
[364:14.90]No, let him come.
[364:16.84]Let him come.
[364:20.54]Let him come.
[364:27.40]Level 5.
[364:30.38]Air Elemental, Water Elemental, Berserk.
[364:35.58]The targeted unit will randomly attack the nearest unit, be it friend or foe.
[364:40.74]Oh, that's fucking pretty great.
[364:52.51]You would put your life savings on Ares?
[364:54.93]Mistake.
[364:56.35]He's coming in.
[364:56.97]We'll see.
[365:01.63]He's pissed.
[365:03.09]Bring it on.
[365:04.97]No, he gave up.
[365:16.01]I'm going after him.
[365:17.13]I'm just fucking going to go after him.
[365:19.07]No, I'm not.
[365:20.15]I'm taking my castle back.
[365:23.87]Stupid.
[365:33.19]You want to meet in the fucking open field?
[365:35.63]I'll do it.
[365:36.03]What do you think?
[365:43.97]I'll wait right here for you.
[365:44.83]Uh-oh.
[366:02.28]Oh shit.
[366:05.04]Oops.
[366:07.39]What is this?
[366:08.01]Refugee camp?
[366:23.04]Where's he going?
[366:23.52]He went by me.
[366:26.98]I'm fucking gonna kill him.
[366:29.54]Imp growth.
[366:30.02]Familiar growth.
[366:30.80]All dwellings increase.
[366:35.65]They're on an open field.
[366:40.85]Let's go.
[366:45.80]Dragon?
[366:46.68]This is why I want to do it in an open field.
[366:49.46]Obliterate immediately.
[366:51.14]Who's the biggest threat?
[366:52.38]Five dragons.
[366:53.10]No, no, no.
[366:54.72]Implode.
[366:55.34]Implode.
[366:55.70]Fucking instantly kill.
[366:57.43]Destroy.
[366:59.05]Implode.
[367:00.45]Implode on the Naga Queens?
[367:06.29]Berserk on the Naga Queen.
[367:11.96]Berserk on the Naga Queen.
[367:15.74]You're all dead.
[367:17.00]Dragon, Obliterate Elders.
[367:22.16]Straight ahead.
[367:28.15]Pegasus.
[367:30.61]Um... I'm gonna go up here.
[367:35.59]Just to stay away from the Naga Queen.
[367:42.41]Wait, I can do this?
[367:44.78]Why can't I buff?
[367:45.26]I couldn't buff him before.
[367:46.02]I'm gonna buff the archers.
[367:51.22]Out of my way.
[367:57.81]This is the revenge arc.
[367:59.87]I'm fucking pissed.
[368:03.19]First it's purple, and then it's blue.
[368:09.03]Naga Queen.
[368:20.06]Beautiful.
[368:21.92]Bye.
[368:22.90]I win.
[368:23.67]Didn't lose anybody.
[368:25.23]Everyone's alive.
[368:27.27]See you later.
[368:28.73]What was that, Ares?
[368:29.43]You want to come up here?
[368:31.13]You have something you want to say?
[368:35.00]You good?
[368:42.07]What's this?
[368:42.83]Star Axis.
[368:46.63]Plus one spell power.
[368:47.65]And I can take this back.
[368:51.06]Not yet.
[368:53.08]I'm good.
[368:53.56]I'm going for my fucking town again.
[368:55.42]I'm gonna claim all the resources.
[368:58.00]I was so... I was pissed.
[369:00.08]I was pissed.
[369:01.26]That's how you knew it was time to go.
[369:02.54]You know what I'm saying?
[369:04.29]That's how you just... It was time to go.
[369:08.44]I'm sorry.
[369:08.86]Did I- I'm sorry, Romeo.
[369:10.20]Did I kill Juliet?
[369:13.42]Come back.
[369:17.18]I'm waiting for you right here.
[369:25.27]He's- holy shit, he's mad.
[369:28.89]Tan has been vanquished.
[369:30.59]Wait, what?
[369:32.79]Tan's dead.
[369:34.73]How?
[369:35.70]What?
[369:36.32]Who killed Tan?
[369:40.36]Tan's dead.
[369:44.90]Plus one defense.
[369:47.28]Who wiped off Tan during this whole thing?
[369:50.30]Orange?
[369:51.78]So it's orange, blue, purple's about to be done.
[369:55.20]This is purple's last stronghold.
[369:56.66]Ares is running away.
[369:59.66]I'm gonna have control.
[370:00.46]Wait, where are you going?
[370:03.08]You sailing over here?
[370:04.28]You motherfucker.
[370:05.42]That's fine.
[370:07.33]I got my guy down here.
[370:13.29]I gotta claim all this shit back.
[370:16.68]Give me my sulfur factory.
[370:20.96]Give me... Alright, get back, get back, get back, get back.
[370:26.54]He's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming.
[370:29.36]Blue has the dragons.
[370:30.62]It don't matter.
[370:31.38]I'll have ten.
[370:33.62]I will fight, I will destroy him.
[370:42.86]Which way is he going?
[370:44.43]I think he's... Let's just see where he goes.
[370:46.07]And then I'm gonna have another... I can recruit... Hold on a second.
[370:51.43]Let me just see where this guy's going.
[370:54.91]He's coming over here.
[370:55.95]Okay.
[370:58.45]You're going for it, aren't you?
[371:00.45]He's going for it.
[371:01.29]He's going for it.
[371:01.79]He's going for it.
[371:02.23]He really wants it.
[371:04.36]Can I teleport from here to there?
[371:06.94]Check this shit out.
[371:08.10]You are fucking dead.
[371:09.60]I cannot wait to do this.
[371:14.28]Am I close enough to this one?
[371:15.51]This is Marishen.
[371:20.05]There's nobody in here.
[371:21.81]Except for me.
[371:34.32]Hi.
[371:41.92]I'll take some more of these, please.
[371:56.04]Were you coming over here?
[371:58.08]Were you on your way over here?
[372:00.16]That's fine, man.
[372:04.17]In an open field.
[372:11.71]Thank god I found that fucking artifact.
[372:16.43]Time to die.
[372:22.21]Oh my god, he has 19 bone dragons.
[372:26.72]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[372:30.54]He has 20 bone dragons.
[372:32.30]Alright, I'm gonna Frenzy Bloodlust on that.
[372:37.56]Will it work?
[372:40.84]Will Berserk work on you?
[372:44.41]Are you immune to spells?
[372:48.57]Berserk?
[373:12.17]We gotta go in hard.
[373:13.71]I got five to the liches here.
[373:22.43]Go in!
[373:27.80]I gotta go in hard immediately.
[373:34.80]Who the pegasus going for?
[373:35.78]This is very important.
[373:43.50]Vampires?
[373:45.82]Oh.
[373:47.29]Genie?
[373:54.17]You know what to do.
[374:02.44]I'm gonna move these guys up a little bit.
[374:10.10]Oh no, that just did a super buff.
[374:13.17]Holy fuck.
[374:18.69]I blame the fucking spell in the beginning.
[374:21.25]Oh my god.
[374:22.31]No, it was a spell in the beginning.
[374:23.55]It was a spell in the beginning.
[374:24.43]It fucked... It ruined everything.
[374:28.14]He is destroying me.
[374:34.24]The spell in the beginning ruined everything.
[374:35.76]I could have given it to anybody else.
[374:40.67]How did you get 20 of these?
[374:42.83]How did you get 20 bone dragons?
[374:45.09]You have no castles.
[374:47.25]He doesn't even have a castle.
[374:51.31]How do you get 20 of these?
[374:53.27]It's like 500,000 gold.
[374:56.53]He's got no land.
[374:57.69]He's got no money.
[374:58.47]How many liches? 30?
[375:13.83]At this point, I'm just screwed.
[375:20.29]We gotta just go.
[375:20.87]We gotta try to wipe some out.
[375:22.01]We gotta try to hurt something.
[375:31.07]Holy shit, man.
[375:33.14]You gotta be kidding me.
[375:35.46]20 fucking goddamn bone dragons.
[375:39.82]Did you find these?
[375:44.24]I had, like, a million gold lying around in a hole somewhere.
[375:48.74]I buried it.
[375:51.04]I lose.
[375:52.78]The only way this is possible is if I can berserk, like, somebody over here.
[375:56.25]I berserk, right?
[376:00.05]On... I don't know.
[376:01.83]Who can I even do this to?
[376:03.17]The unicorns?
[376:04.87]The trees?
[376:05.29]See if that works.
[376:11.62]And then I'm gonna try to buff... I don't fucking know.
[376:14.68]I don't have anybody left to do this to.
[376:20.67]Archers?
[376:31.26]I think he's cleansed everybody.
[376:37.02]20 fucking dragons.
[376:38.80]That's a horse.
[376:39.50]That's dog shit.
[376:41.10]That is impossible.
[376:42.24]I just saw this guy, like, a week ago.
[376:47.00]And you didn't have 19 bone dragons.
[376:55.57]I'm dead.
[377:03.48]150 health each.
[377:05.29]Fucking 25 to 50 damage.
[377:11.05]I really thought I was going to win this one.
[377:24.98]Fuck.
[377:29.97]I can't even...
[377:39.35]That's un-fucking-believable.
[377:48.61]I was, like, so confident, too.
[377:54.17]Pack of bone dragons.
[377:58.13]Hey, shove those bone dragons up your ass.
[378:00.96]You fucking dick.
[378:11.70]I don't even know if this is winnable.
[378:17.02]Maybe I shouldn't even go after him.
[378:18.54]I'm not sure I can even do this.
[378:19.70]Let me try one thing.
[378:34.02]Let's see.
[378:34.66]Hold on.
[378:37.08]Okay.
[378:38.33]I'm talking about potentially.
[378:41.12]What about, like, an Elemental?
[378:44.38]A Berserk.
[378:45.60]Implosion.
[378:46.34]This does 577 damage.
[378:51.54]I could Implode the Dragon, which would take, like, at least, what, like, five or six of them away?
[378:59.52]Maybe, like, four?
[379:00.46]Five?
[379:04.57]Three.
[379:06.87]Alright, it's very clear that the Dragons have to die, so what, okay.
[379:10.68]150, 2550, 250, 40 to 50.
[379:14.51]I might just do dragon to dragon here.
[379:25.26]I'm gonna die.
[379:32.98]Well, maybe I should hold back.
[379:35.24]No, the dragon's gonna fly over here.
[379:41.01]If I leave him... I mean, I'm going to sacrifice this dragon right now, essentially.
[379:44.37]5 versus 16.
[379:45.93]They have more HP.
[379:47.42]But, I mean, maybe I'll be able to kill a couple.
[379:49.20]Let's just see what happens.
[379:54.98]16, 13, 4.
[379:55.64]Alright.
[379:56.88]Not a bad strategy so far.
[379:59.68]I'm going to Berserk this guy right here, probably.
[380:02.72]Or this one.
[380:04.08]I'm not going anywhere yet.
[380:14.02]Berserk the Treant, probably, then.
[380:16.40]Undead spell?
[380:17.16]Well, the last time I did undead spell, it only killed one person.
[380:19.58]Remember I tried it already?
[380:27.15]And it only killed, like, it only took away one person?
[380:33.91]It affects everybody.
[380:34.73]We'll see.
[380:34.97]We'll try it.
[380:38.59]Um, I don't think I want to go in with anybody right now, but what's the play here?
[380:43.59]I wonder if
[380:54.78]I'm not sure I go in.
[380:55.58]They're going to attack the dragon, but... I could go after the unicorns.
[381:02.83]110, 18, 22.
[381:04.53]Let's see if I... I'm just going in for the vampires.
[381:16.32]Sounds like a plan.
[381:16.96]57, 48...
[381:20.37]Alright, now I've got the genie.
[381:21.73]The genie should really buff up the ranged.
[381:32.44]Heal.
[381:33.40]Damn it.
[381:39.96]That sucks!
[381:43.02]I need to be...
[381:47.72]Well, let's just do this.
[381:49.66]Frenzy.
[381:51.06]Good.
[381:52.78]I'm just gonna move up.
[381:56.51]Of course, you do that.
[382:03.63]No, dude.
[382:04.51]No, no way.
[382:05.91]No way.
[382:06.59]I have to berserk somebody at the very beginning.
[382:10.12]Otherwise, I will never win this in a million years.
[382:20.55]Somebody has to get Berserk'd immediately.
[382:27.88]Hold on.
[382:29.04]Let's see what I can do here.
[382:35.26]It could be possible.
[382:36.54]If I Berserk somebody right at the start.
[382:38.70]Let's see.
[382:39.02]Let me try it now.
[382:41.06]Let me look because this might be a watch.
[382:42.58]Let's do the Undead thing.
[382:47.36]Destroy Undead.
[382:52.29]I don't think it killed anybody.
[382:57.49]Nobody died.
[383:00.76]So everybody's saying I had to do that.
[383:03.48]I hope you see what happened.
[383:16.93]These guys are actually the bad... I wonder if I berserk...
[383:24.38]Let me see who I can even Berserk.
[383:25.46]Because I'll try that at the beginning.
[383:27.02]This is too much.
[383:28.94]What level is this hero?
[383:31.92]Oh fuck, destroyed.
[383:33.16]Alright, try again.
[383:34.92]God damn it.
[383:41.27]He's so powerful.
[383:42.89]It's not fair how powerful you are.
[383:45.37]You shouldn't be this powerful.
[383:50.73]Okay.
[383:52.07]Berserk the tree.
[383:57.05]I can Berserk the Unicorn, or I can Berserk the Treant.
[384:03.84]Nobody else can be Berserked.
[384:09.59]The trees will last a lot longer, but the Unicorn might do more.
[384:12.79]Let's try the Unicorn.
[384:15.49]It worked.
[384:15.97]Alright.
[384:17.09]Now... Now... I'm going for the Dragon.
[384:22.22]Unicorn's also gonna go for the Dragon.
[384:31.78]Or do I just not move?
[384:34.82]Does nobody move?
[384:41.69]Should I buff him?
[384:45.09]Nobody move.
[384:46.25]Everybody just sit here.
[384:51.54]Did he cleanse it?
[384:56.91]Um, no.
[384:58.89]No, there's no way.
[385:01.33]This is impossible.
[385:05.17]There's only one way this is possible and I need to get like 25 dragons.
[385:09.11]This is unwinnable.
[385:14.47]I have to just turtle for five weeks.
[385:33.66]It's not doable.
[385:34.66]I gotta... I was so overconfident, too.
[385:37.89]That's the worst part about this.
[385:40.47]He's gonna get this town again.
[385:42.07]Alright, I need a dragon.
[385:48.87]We're gonna meet in the middle here.
[385:50.07]We're gonna do a dragon trade.
[385:51.47]Fuck.
[385:54.46]What do I have?
[385:56.42]I have... Five dragons.
[386:02.08]Honestly, I need to, like...
[386:14.20]Maybe I could win from the castle.
[386:15.64]No, because the dragon can just fly over it.
[386:24.42]How many dragons can I have right now?
[386:25.94]There's two there.
[386:26.78]I have two that can be recruited.
[386:29.79]Two on him.
[386:38.33]So two, four.
[386:39.13]I'll have, like, nine dragons.
[386:46.94]Get some more archers.
[386:50.28]Get more of these.
[386:51.36]More pegasus.
[386:55.91]Do I not have the upgraded ones?
[386:57.47]I can get more of these too.
[387:03.57]Just get them just to get them.
[387:05.10]Okay, so I have two more dragons.
[387:07.40]He's going to take this.
[387:08.78]What do I do with the guys that are here right now?
[387:12.22]You're just gonna... I mean, I may as well... I... Fuck.
[387:18.94]I'm so screwed.
[387:22.50]I'm just gonna have to go back down here and just get more.
[387:36.29]Admit defeat?
[387:37.17]Not yet.
[387:37.71]Not yet.
[387:38.27]Not yet.
[387:38.63]I'm not done yet.
[387:39.59]I still have plenty of property.
[387:41.93]I just need to get to the right spot.
[387:44.59]I can trade some units here.
[387:46.03]I have a lot.
[387:47.61]This guy can just be like a good unit trader.
[387:49.30]I've conquered all this over here.
[387:54.72]He's gonna go take the castle.
[387:56.64]Whatever.
[387:57.20]Take it.
[387:58.10]I don't care.
[388:02.45]There he goes.
[388:05.09]He'll get it.
[388:06.03]Whatever.
[388:06.41]Fucking nineteen bone dragons.
[388:14.87]I saw you, like, less than two weeks ago.
[388:16.97]Motherfucker.
[388:17.72]I can't believe it.
[388:20.22]Well, I could do... This is a good opportunity to just... Maybe I can wipe out some unicorns.
[388:24.46]What level are you?
[388:38.26]The computer just gave him all this random shit.
[388:40.72]He didn't do anything for this.
[388:42.44]They gave him to him.
[388:57.25]Well, here's the thing.
[388:58.33]He might leave some of these here.
[389:00.09]Which is a good thing.
[389:00.79]Maybe I'll just be able to turn around him.
[389:05.37]You know, you like leave the vampires and the fucking... Okay, whatever.
[389:11.85]What did he leave there?
[389:13.29]Alright, he left some... he left a bunch of shit here.
[389:22.63]He left the unicorns, he left his treants.
[389:32.90]No, he still has so many.
[389:35.90]Not worth it.
[389:36.55]Stick with the plan.
[389:39.87]Stick to the plan.
[389:45.79]Come here.
[389:47.97]Seven dragons.
[389:49.11]More centaurs.
[389:52.05]I need to upgrade these pegasuses.
[390:01.64]Do I not have it?
[390:02.95]Can I... I... Where's my... Treasure Reef.
[390:08.42]Silver Pegasi.
[390:09.32]There it is.
[390:09.76]Upgrade.
[390:13.56]I wanna upgrade these too.
[390:16.76]I need to upgrade the archers.
[390:18.10]I'm gonna just sit down here and fucking turtle.
[390:21.95]He's blocked off the path of escape.
[390:23.29]Well, this is my final stand.
[390:24.71]If I'm dead, then I'm dead.
[390:26.75]And it was really fun.
[390:27.67]This game's fucking awesome.
[390:31.01]So, if this is it, this is it.
[390:32.57]If he's, like, fucking coming down here to kill me, then that's it.
[390:39.68]And I'll have to just say, well, what do you know?
[390:41.92]Oh, well.
[390:45.62]Oh, here he comes.
[390:47.98]He's coming down here.
[390:49.52]He's coming to get us.
[390:50.74]We have to... Everybody... I'm parking him in the front.
[390:55.20]Yeah, I'm going to be inside, and then this Khalid guy is going to be standing at the front door.
[391:10.12]Okay, nine dragons.
[391:12.86]116 archers.
[391:14.92]293 centaurs.
[391:21.12]58.
[391:21.14]1638.
[391:25.32]Like, this is... This is so ridiculous.
[391:29.14]Like, I have to be able to put up a defect.
[391:31.68]The genies instead of... I need... Genies instead of the dwarves?
[391:42.46]You could recruit heroes across the map and start anew there and conquer the other dudes.
[391:46.96]Yeah, but I have like a personal vendetta right now.
[391:53.91]Can anything else be upgraded?
[391:57.85]I don't know.
[391:58.25]Treasury.
[392:00.27]10% interest.
[392:00.73]Fortune.
[392:02.15]Luck of the garrison in the hereby two.
[392:03.85]Let's do it.
[392:04.99]They're coming in.
[392:10.28]So let's trade with you.
[392:14.35]You can take the dwarves.
[392:17.51]I will take the pegasus.
[392:18.91]I will take these.
[392:22.70]Okay.
[392:25.56]Go back in there.
[392:30.26]You go in there.
[392:39.74]Oh, more unicorns.
[392:42.24]Okay, now I think he's back to you.
[392:51.28]Okay, get back in here.
[392:56.18]Get up here.
[392:56.72]Hold on.
[392:57.86]I need to, like, switch this out.
[393:08.61]This is such a joke.
[393:09.65]I can't believe I'm doing this.
[393:15.40]Alright, well, here we go.
[393:16.78]I've got... This is my army.
[393:20.26]He's gonna be outside.
[393:21.31]119.
[393:21.33]This is just... He's just here.
[393:25.23]I also have this still, but it's the only other thing I got.
[393:29.91]Park yourself in here.
[393:41.22]Almost 10 dragons.
[393:44.22]I have so many people.
[393:45.30]Like, I just gotta stay behind the walls and just try to fight.
[393:48.78]Can you put both in the castle?
[393:50.24]I don't think you can.
[393:52.74]I mean, no.
[393:53.32]He can just stand right outside the door.
[393:54.86]Okay.
[394:00.46]Here comes our inevitable defeat.
[394:09.00]Let him in the castle and then run away with the teleport spell.
[394:20.13]But then I would just go all the way back and it repeats again.
[394:23.27]And I just have to go, like, what's even blue doing?
[394:28.06]Is this Orange's only place?
[394:29.94]I don't think this guy's moved.
[394:33.94]Has Orange moved the whole- I don't think he can leave.
[394:38.82]He can't even leave.
[394:40.82]He's just over here.
[394:46.60]God damn it.
[394:47.40]Well, whatever.
[394:48.06]It was fun.
[394:49.92]Let's see what happens.
[394:53.66]This red is still a player.
[394:57.39]Here he comes.
[394:57.95]Okay, there he goes.
[395:17.66]I got one Titan here.
[395:21.52]It's possible that I could make it to week seven.
[395:32.66]Look at all the purple.
[395:33.98]Purple had nothing.
[395:35.94]Fucking, like, a week ago.
[395:41.55]And now all of a sudden you have everything.
[395:44.09]Did you just do something over here?
[395:45.81]Like Tan died and you picked up all the houses for free?
[396:13.85]I don't even know what that did.
[396:16.85]It's inevitable.
[396:17.75]Maybe he'll go this way and I can buy a few more dragons.
[396:27.48]I want to, like, start over the scenario.
[396:29.02]Here comes the other guy.
[396:29.92]What?
[396:34.56]Oh, this is... It's over.
[396:37.30]This is my other stronghold.
[396:38.95]I'm about to be wiped out.
[396:41.74]I'm actually about to be completely removed from the game.
[396:53.39]Quick, kill the king!
[396:54.77]Throw a bolt at the king's head!
[396:56.09]I've been restarting my scenario because I suck at this game, oh man.
[397:04.59]I mean, it's a pretty... The game's not necessarily easy.
[397:13.96]That is a lot of fun, though.
[397:20.64]How do they have these units?
[397:21.76]I don't know.
[397:23.00]He came into a fucking, like, trust or something.
[397:28.25]Somehow, he... Maybe when he... You know what might have happened?
[397:31.13]So, you know how I said Tan was defeated?
[397:34.13]He may have just stumbled upon Tan's last building and then took all of Tan's money.
[397:38.48]Because Tan... I figured it out.
[397:40.62]This is what happened.
[397:41.98]So Tan wasn't doing anything all game.
[397:44.12]It was just stockpiling money and stockpiling resources.
[397:49.75]So he took over Tan because Tan was just a fucking moron.
[397:53.03]He was like walking in circles and took all of his money and all of his stuff like Monopoly style and then just built like 30 dragons.
[397:59.84]I think that's what happened.
[398:05.83]I mean, like, that was fucking absurd.
[398:13.01]Why didn't I do that?
[398:14.03]I mean, this is my first game coming back from, you know, a while.
[398:21.50]God damn it.
[398:23.28]Purple.
[398:25.28]I can feel- Yes!
[398:26.60]Okay.
[398:27.78]My last stand is now here.
[398:30.34]I can get more dragons.
[398:34.17]Ten dragons.
[398:36.27]That's all I can afford.
[398:38.15]Wait, I can sell all my resources.
[398:40.47]Okay, hold on.
[398:45.68]Okay, I want money.
[398:47.30]I'm willing to give you this.
[398:49.56]Wow, this is bad.
[398:52.36]No, I need those.
[398:53.36]What do I need for a dragon?
[398:55.24]Crystals.
[398:55.60]I need two crystals.
[398:57.63]I have two crystals.
[398:59.73]It's time to, like, liquidate.
[399:00.77]I'm liquidating.
[399:08.14]No, no, get here.
[399:11.60]I'm gonna liquidate my entire... Yeah, it's liquidation time.
[399:16.64]This is it.
[399:17.88]He's knocking on my front door.
[399:19.42]I'm the last remaining Monopoly player.
[399:22.38]40.
[399:25.24]Sell gold for gold, huh?
[399:27.98]Wood.
[399:28.68]Look at how bad of a trade-off this is.
[399:34.81]I'm the last remaining fucking Monopoly player.
[399:36.61]I'm gonna at least go out with a bang.
[399:53.92]Okay.
[399:55.70]11 dragons.
[399:56.18]88.
[400:03.59]I have fucking 323 of these.
[400:09.47]That has to be worth something.
[400:13.09]No more money.
[400:21.45]Liquidate everything else.
[400:28.04]Just liquidate everything.
[400:30.70]I have to.
[400:31.66]It's over.
[400:33.84]This is the end.
[400:36.34]If I win, then I beat the- I beat the hardest fucking guy on the map.
[400:46.04]We'll see.
[400:51.55]What can I buy?
[400:52.91]Treants, probably.
[400:53.63]Probably better.
[400:55.79]Yep, that's it.
[400:57.36]I have 100 bucks.
[400:59.18]I have 101 dollars.
[401:06.46]Good luck, everybody.
[401:10.34]This is our final stand.
[401:17.95]Here we go.
[401:24.25]Blue and red have just been fighting.
[401:25.57]This is what happens in these games.
[401:29.49]Here it comes.
[401:31.65]And he walked by us.
[401:33.72]He's just toying me.
[401:43.60]I have zero resources.
[401:44.95]I have nothing.
[401:47.69]Just come over here and fight me.
[401:57.22]Engage him.
[401:59.42]Fight the open battle with this guy.
[402:01.54]This is gonna be embarrassingly awful.
[402:13.85]If I can kill... You wanna know what the plan here is?
[402:16.61]You wanna know exactly what I'm doing?
[402:19.91]The plan is, try to at least get rid of one or two bone dragons.
[402:26.42]That's it.
[402:36.05]I can't even cast these.
[402:49.80]This guy's level one.
[402:51.07]I, like, fucked it up from the very beginning.
[402:55.09]It's alright, though.
[402:56.05]Like, it's the first time I've played in a while, you know?
[402:59.25]And sometimes you just gotta learn.
[403:01.86]This is a seven hour learning experience.
[403:04.64]Good, come over here.
[403:06.78]Send in the dwarves.
[403:11.44]All I care about is just hurting this dragon.
[403:20.63]Kill one.
[403:22.61]Yes!
[403:23.51]Okay, he got one.
[403:25.65]Try to get a couple more.
[403:28.85]Just try.
[403:29.53]Get this down to like 15.
[403:31.23]And then I got like 11 dragons.
[403:34.63]Fine, come up here.
[403:36.94]Ooh!
[403:37.66]That's pretty good!
[403:38.34]17!
[403:38.36]It's getting... Did a good job.
[403:44.44]I just realized that was hair.
[403:48.36]Is that hair?
[403:51.09]It's alright.
[403:51.43]He lost two dragons.
[404:00.86]This is a castle, right?
[404:05.82]Yes.
[404:06.70]Okay.
[404:07.32]I just was making sure.
[404:15.49]It's time.
[404:17.99]Can we hold this off?
[404:23.18]I ain't coming out.
[404:27.19]Oh no, he sent in his shitty... It's her again.
[404:37.08]They're like, lookit, they're just like, they're just so fun together!
[404:54.60]This is my final castle.
[404:56.78]Come on, bring it.
[404:58.94]Do it!
[405:00.40]Do it!
[405:01.22]End me!
[405:02.12]End my misery!
[405:03.12]I'm getting out.
[405:03.78]Let's go.
[405:04.16]I'm killing her.
[405:11.30]You're fucking dead.
[405:12.90]And this time, I'm killing her.
[405:14.36]You know what I mean?
[405:14.96]Like, if there's one thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make sure that she's dead.
[405:21.52]Going for the fucking dwarves immediately.
[405:23.38]Insta-kill.
[405:24.22]No.
[405:24.42]You know what?
[405:25.28]Fucking... What do I want to do here?
[405:30.43]This is going to be embarrassing.
[405:31.57]I'm going to just be awful.
[405:34.09]Just Inferno?
[405:34.73]No, I don't want to spend that many points.
[405:37.01]I don't even need to do that.
[405:39.13]The dragon will kill them all in one hit.
[405:48.50]Don't let her run.
[405:52.63]Let's kill the archers.
[405:57.59]And then buff.
[406:01.41]Do not retreat.
[406:03.01]Please, let me just have one victory.
[406:04.79]Let me, like, kill your wife or your friend.
[406:08.05]Dead.
[406:14.64]Now he can turn around.
[406:15.40]I got you.
[406:17.18]I got your feet.
[406:18.08]Warning on the feet.
[406:18.78]This item increases your knowledge and power by plus one.
[406:21.94]Leveled up.
[406:24.23]more damage sorcery what are you gonna say about that huh what are you gonna do about it what are you gonna do about it a whole lot of nothing they're gone I put them on
[406:53.08]I'm out though.
[406:54.04]Maybe now he's gonna turn around.
[406:57.94]No, he's not turning around yet.
[406:59.28]He's leaving.
[407:00.64]No.
[407:01.06]Why are you leaving?
[407:02.10]Don't do this to me.
[407:05.62]Fuck.
[407:06.60]I'm just... Am I gonna... You know what?
[407:08.86]I got a better idea.
[407:10.38]I'm abandoning my home.
[407:14.16]Next week.
[407:32.33]God damn it.
[407:33.33]What do I do?
[407:34.33]I just... I thought that was gonna be it.
[407:36.60]Um... I'm gonna go kill Orange.
[407:40.86]Orange is dead.
[407:41.48]Watch this shit.
[407:42.40]You ready?
[407:46.06]I'm gonna wipe out Orange right now.
[407:57.83]I think I can do it.
[408:01.17]And I'm gonna take all of his money.
[408:13.43]Let's get in there.
[408:17.03]We're going for... If I can't kill purple, I'm going for orange.
[408:26.78]Berserk.
[408:29.22]Berserk on the manticores.
[408:35.36]I'm gonna win.
[408:35.94]I'm gonna take this castle.
[408:37.50]And I'm gonna sit here for fucking a year.
[408:42.14]Just you wait.
[408:48.50]Just get the dragon in now.
[408:56.55]Everybody get in.
[408:57.87]Get in now.
[408:58.37]Everybody get in.
[409:02.17]Don't give him a second.
[409:04.11]Buff.
[409:07.69]Manticore.
[409:10.41]Oh, what's that?
[409:11.05]Now you're gonna fight the dragon, huh?
[409:14.64]Dead.
[409:16.44]Good, they're killing each other.
[409:17.22]Thank god.
[409:23.58]Okay.
[409:25.80]How many dragons do I have left?
[409:33.81]Get him up here.
[409:36.75]Archers to... I can't see who's up here.
[409:39.47]Maybe the Minotaurs?
[409:46.01]Or the... Who's left?
[409:51.76]Or maybe the...
[409:53.98]Medusas, yeah.
[410:00.24]I can't get in, though.
[410:01.96]That door's gonna open.
[410:10.55]Give me all his money.
[410:13.81]What do we think?
[410:15.35]Maybe I should kill the Medusas, or should I go right for the Minotaur?
[410:17.95]Minotaur.
[410:18.29]12 Minotaurs dead.
[410:25.10]I'm going to Berserk somebody else.
[410:34.50]Berserk on the... I wonder who I should do this to.
[410:42.01]Probably the Manticore again.
[410:44.59]Or on the Minotaur.
[410:45.95]They haven't attacked yet.
[410:49.43]Or on the Lich.
[410:52.59]I can't.
[410:52.89]He's undead.
[410:57.04]I can't.
[410:57.32]You can't do it undead.
[411:01.84]Maybe Medusa's.
[411:03.04]Maybe the Harpies and they'll fly over and just kill themselves.
[411:09.78]Or... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[411:12.58]I'm gonna implode.
[411:15.08]I'm just gonna obliterate completely.
[411:16.60]Always implode.
[411:20.09]Implosion on the Manticore.
[411:22.33]Just melt him.
[411:26.35]Here we go.
[411:26.73]Okay, great.
[411:27.24]Good, good, good!
[411:29.70]Minotaur, attack!
[411:32.48]Six Minotaurs dead.
[411:33.24]I just burnt my own people!
[411:43.32]I got this.
[411:43.76]I'm gonna win.
[411:48.87]Okay.
[411:53.37]I get to go again?
[411:54.89]Do it twice.
[412:00.87]I can't get in there.
[412:01.63]I can't go anywhere.
[412:18.76]Get the dragon out.
[412:20.30]He's... I can't.
[412:33.09]How many dragons?
[412:33.73]Five?
[412:36.11]Versus five?
[412:38.03]No, kill him.
[412:39.55]I can do it.
[412:44.24]Okay, I'm gonna get him out.
[412:49.60]Bad move.
[412:50.66]No, you can go back.
[412:54.32]Okay, hold on.
[412:55.26]Kill the Minotaurs.
[412:58.89]Whiz, resurrect.
[413:00.73]Resurrection.
[413:07.66]I can't do it to the, uh, dragon.
[413:13.32]I'm gonna implode again.
[413:27.36]I can't do it to anybody.
[413:36.24]I should have left the fucking dragon in.
[413:39.39]I should have left the dragon inside!
[413:41.27]How many you left?
[413:46.85]Five?
[413:47.19]There's only one more Minotaur left.
[413:51.98]Kill it!
[413:54.38]I can't even get in here!
[414:01.06]I got this.
[414:01.54]I'm gonna win.
[414:09.00]Alright, it's open.
[414:12.66]Dragon to Manticore.
[414:27.21]This Manticore has to die.
[414:39.24]How many points left?
[414:40.06]69 points.
[414:41.08]Implode.
[414:49.87]It's alright.
[414:50.41]The dragons are fine.
[414:51.23]Everything's fine.
[414:54.76]I can't move.
[415:11.55]I have to kill this manticore.
[415:13.53]Right now.
[415:15.21]With my dragon.
[415:16.19]These walls have to collapse.
[415:17.91]Manticore.
[415:19.71]Got it.
[415:19.95]I win.
[415:22.64]I have to win.
[415:24.08]I win.
[415:34.42]Go in.
[415:35.78]With the genie.
[415:50.82]I got the dragon still in here.
[415:54.54]I can't get in, unfortunately.
[415:56.04]There's nothing I can do.
[415:59.68]Burn!
[416:00.20]29 Harpies dead.
[416:16.62]22 harpies dead It's so close, but the others can't do anything implode.
[416:23.65]I don't have any more points.
[416:24.63]I've only four magic arrow
[416:44.44]I'm going to take it.
[416:45.48]Hopefully this is all of orange.
[416:46.58]15-1.
[416:46.62]Game over.
[417:13.39]Ah, fuck.
[417:13.81]He's too big.
[417:14.31]I got... almost 17,000 experience.
[417:21.96]Oh my god.
[417:36.25]I got Torso of Legion and Spell Scroll.
[417:40.95]This item when equipped by a hero in a town increases the growth of your fourth level units by three per week.
[417:49.18]And this scroll contains the Dimension Door spell which is added into your spell book for as long as you carry the scroll.
[418:00.95]More experience.
[418:03.06]Yeah.
[418:04.40]Expert sorcery.
[418:06.14]15% more damage.
[418:09.06]Yes.
[418:11.46]Orange has been vanquished.
[418:12.90]I killed him.
[418:13.36]He was stuck here.
[418:15.42]What did I get?
[418:19.99]Did I get anything?
[418:20.75]I killed Orange.
[418:21.89]He was just sitting here.
[418:23.39]What do I get for killing Orange?
[418:27.13]I beat him.
[418:27.73]I won.
[418:33.59]I did it!
[418:34.17]I killed Orange.
[418:41.15]I don't get anything.
[418:48.13]Uh... I have 224 skeletons.
[418:57.88]I still have this house.
[418:59.36]Who's in here?
[418:59.90]There's nobody here.
[419:12.66]Uh... Now what?
[419:15.95]Orange is gone.
[419:16.75]Tana's gone.
[419:24.81]Now I'm the new Orange.
[419:29.25]Oh, I see.
[419:30.21]Because I can't leave.
[419:42.57]That's why he was up here for so long because he ran out of places so he didn't have another castle and he was stuck here.
[419:57.87]That's fucking hilarious.
[419:59.43]So I actually just went up here for no reason because Orange didn't give me anything for losing and he was actually just stuck here for eternity.
[420:13.21]Alright, what's the spell?
[420:14.03]Let's see what it is.
[420:15.47]Visions.
[420:17.01]What was it called?
[420:18.63]Dimension something?
[420:19.41]I think it has to be my inventory.
[420:26.94]Oh, let's just put it on.
[420:32.22]So, it's on.
[420:34.06]So, what is it called?
[420:38.21]Dimension Door.
[420:40.41]Once per day, you may teleport your hero to a visible, unoccupied location on the map.
[420:53.21]Hey.
[420:54.50]Was it worth it?
[420:56.58]You tell me at this point, because... I, um... I absolutely would not have gotten the Dimension Door.
[421:07.22]Growth of your 4th level units by 3 per week.
[421:11.88]Here's your Eagle Eye skill.
[421:14.02]I feel like I don't... I feel like this is much better.
[421:15.97]Eagle Eye skill.
[421:18.05]By 10%.
[421:18.39]No, put this on.
[421:20.65]I want more growth.
[421:25.91]Just a orb.
[421:26.97]Extra spell points per day.
[421:30.60]This is really good.
[421:31.40]This is really good.
[421:33.46]That's really good.
[421:37.49]Alright.
[421:39.67]As the new orange, I'm gonna turtle here.
[421:43.61]This stream is gonna be like fucking very long.
[421:48.73]What do we have in here?
[421:54.39]Mana Vortex!
[421:55.45]I don't have any resources though, guys.
[422:07.25]This place sucks.
[422:09.81]How the fuck did you not upgrade any of this?
[422:13.05]You were sitting here for like three months.
[422:15.23]You didn't upgrade anything?
[422:18.57]What an idiot.
[422:27.42]So I'm just gonna teleport and take stuff and teleport back.
[422:38.03]Finally, someone worthy, I shall send word immediately to the border guard that you'll be allowed to pass.
[422:41.68]Okay.
[422:41.96]Alright, so I'm going to take this dickhead.
[422:47.28]And we're going to go resource hunting.
[422:48.78]That's all you are for.
[422:50.10]Is just to get resources.
[422:55.98]Even if it's one a day, you can just kind of chill in the tent.
[423:00.25]No, wait a minute.
[423:00.73]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[423:01.41]I can teleport.
[423:01.93]I can teleport over here.
[423:05.09]Oh my god.
[423:18.11]13, not enough.
[423:28.81]Alright, just... I'm gonna... Look at all this shit that purple has now.
[423:39.94]This is not... I'll never win.
[423:46.20]Look at the map.
[423:48.65]I don't even know what's over here.
[423:52.19]Purple has everything.
[424:03.07]He's got like a bunch of... Look at all his heroes now.
[424:06.85]He's got like five heroes.
[424:08.43]All of them have dragons.
[424:11.46]Lots of bone dragons.
[424:14.24]It's not a pack anymore.
[424:21.96]There's probably 30 dragons there now.
[424:31.08]There's no way I can win this.
[424:35.91]I mean... Okay, remember Warcraft 3?
[424:38.83]How you would play that person online?
[424:41.33]That you would wipe them out and it'd be clearly you're going to win the game.
[424:44.03]Very clearly, you won.
[424:46.17]And they build like five farms in random places on the map.
[424:53.61]That's what I'm doing.
[424:57.32]I still have a gold mine and a town hall that I built just to be an asshole.
[425:06.72]Just somewhere, and he's just looking for me.
[425:13.02]Run out the clock.
[425:15.68]Five months we've been doing this.
[425:20.09]And this is just on... Well, okay.
[425:21.37]What's it on?
[425:23.97]It's on the normal difficulty with like a 30% increase in difficulty on the actual game, right?
[425:35.85]There's still imps over here!
[426:08.01]I lose.
[426:09.27]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[426:11.97]I can make some more dragons, but I don't... I could just make dragons and I don't have enough money.
[426:18.68]It's over.
[426:19.16]I lose.
[426:19.82]I lose.
[426:24.30]I lose.
[426:24.65]There's nothing I can do.
[426:25.69]He has so much.
[426:27.13]I didn't even get to have my last stand.
[426:40.79]Here he comes.
[426:43.55]He's about to put me in perpetual fucking nightmare mode.
[426:56.96]Run!
[426:57.96]Run away!
[426:59.18]Don't... He's trying to stick me in purgatory, but he doesn't know that I can teleport.
[427:05.00]You don't know shit.
[427:09.50]260 points.
[427:10.35]Are you ready for this?
[427:29.90]Asshole!
[427:33.33]Get the castle!
[427:42.14]Mine!
[427:51.54]Not going down.
[427:54.81]In fact, I'm going to teleport tomorrow and take another one.
[427:57.57]I'm going to teleport over here.
[427:59.15]And then I'm going to teleport, like, over here.
[428:00.55]Oh, I have to be able to see it.
[428:03.88]Never mind.
[428:16.51]I'm gonna get a ball.
[428:18.47]What a- What?
[428:20.71]Hold on.
[428:20.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[428:21.59]Yeah, how did you get that?
[428:25.93]There was nobody there?
[428:26.71]There wasn't anyone even there.
[428:33.32]That's so stupid.
[428:34.82]Oh, god damn it.
[428:35.78]Now he's stuck.
[428:38.46]He's stuck.
[428:40.27]It's there.
[428:41.63]He's not gonna be able to get out.
[428:43.71]He's not gonna be able to leave.
[428:48.49]I have a chance.
[428:51.93]He's got all of his best units here.
[428:53.47]I'm gonna fucking win the game.
[428:56.37]Boys and girls, let's go.
[428:57.75]I'm ready.
[428:58.23]I'm fucking pumped right now.
[429:08.28]Alright, let's go.
[429:10.16]Pick up some resources along the way.
[429:11.62]He can't leave.
[429:15.68]Go get all the land back.
[429:19.28]he's just gonna pack a few a few lots pack you should telefrag them give me the dragons
[429:50.46]Hold on.
[429:51.34]Let's see what happens.
[429:55.72]Is there a way that I can make them all go in the portal?
[429:58.90]Blue has finally made it over here.
[430:16.38]Oh, shit.
[430:17.88]Fuck it.
[430:18.22]Yeah, take over all this stuff.
[430:20.22]Fight each other.
[430:20.76]Kill them.
[430:22.30]You fight down there while I take everything up top.
[430:24.22]I'm going to do this very slowly.
[430:28.00]No, no, no, no.
[430:30.73]Take it all.
[430:34.77]Then I'm going to know what I'm doing.
[430:43.93]Here he goes.
[430:47.10]This is awesome.
[430:48.28]I'm so happy right now.
[430:49.16]What else can I take going this way?
[430:58.64]I can get the sulfur.
[431:01.22]Yep.
[431:05.50]Okay, keep going.
[431:06.30]Why are you coming down to me?
[431:12.96]Why are you going down to me?
[431:17.88]Uh-oh.
[431:25.50]Teleport?
[431:28.62]I just, I can't tell.
[431:29.84]This is fucking so stupid.
[431:41.81]He's got nothing in there.
[431:43.69]Where is he?
[431:45.17]He's up there?
[431:53.66]Oh, it's blue.
[431:56.44]No, I needed these dragons.
[431:57.42]I was going to come back and get them.
[432:03.13]Um... Quicksand Icebolt.
[432:16.87]He has all, I think, the best units, at least top tier units, all in each slot.
[432:31.77]It's over.
[432:36.06]They all can fly.
[432:40.80]Might as well just go out the front door.
[432:46.26]Meet them all in the open field.
[432:47.72]There's not much I can do about this.
[432:49.93]Maybe I can take out one or two, but it don't matter.
[433:00.93]You got some cool monsters, though.
[433:10.29]One dwarf.
[433:13.79]Why is it one, one, one, one?
[433:16.69]This seems weird.
[433:25.67]The thing is though, when I had my original, my like 11 dragons, my 300 centaurs, I probably could have done this.
[433:34.75]This would have been a good fight.
[433:35.96]I would have won without much of a problem, I think.
[433:43.64]It was just purple.
[433:44.54]Purple somehow just amassed a fortune and amassed a ton of money.
[433:48.20]Well.
[434:22.41]Kill the genies.
[434:26.84]Yes, we're back home.
[434:29.84]Genie versus genie.
[434:31.94]Good.
[434:46.19]Attack a dragon.
[434:46.91]What a mistake.
[434:48.03]I have 245 skeletons, though.
[434:51.46]Maybe I'll get lucky and I will get, like, a thousand skeletons.
[434:56.42]Right?
[435:08.89]Two thousand experience.
[435:10.37]Got my capital back.
[435:11.19]What's in here?
[435:13.31]Alright.
[435:15.35]I can get some Titans, I think.
[435:22.22]Two Titans.
[435:25.80]I can get some more of these.
[435:29.12]What else?
[435:30.38]Genies?
[435:32.20]No Genies.
[435:32.74]I can fill up on these.
[435:35.03]Forty-five.
[435:42.03]I could get a bunch of these.
[435:43.09]No.
[435:43.35]I got one Titan.
[435:55.70]What do you got?
[435:56.22]Few.
[435:56.56]Pack.
[435:57.62]Several.
[435:58.22]Wrong.
[435:58.78]Lots.
[435:59.26]Horde.
[436:01.66]Guys.
[436:02.48]Guys, I can beat this.
[436:03.14]I can win.
[436:06.44]I can win right now.
[436:07.18]I can kill this person right now.
[436:22.32]Go ahead and fight each other down here.
[436:25.10]Let's go.
[436:26.10]You got nothing.
[436:26.74]What do you got?
[436:29.38]I'm going right... We're not wasting a second.
[436:33.62]I'm going to obliterate.
[436:39.82]Where is it?
[436:40.34]I have so many spells.
[436:43.45]Where is obliterate?
[436:49.71]Where is it?
[436:50.23]Obliterate.
[436:57.59]Implosion, not obliterate.
[436:59.19]You know what I'm saying, obliterate.
[437:14.40]Ares is stuck in the corner.
[437:17.03]I might actually be able to do this.
[437:18.97]As long as I can, like, kind of... Why am I walking with the archer?
[437:28.93]I'm losing it.
[437:30.51]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[437:38.17]Okay.
[437:39.45]That's pretty good.
[437:40.71]Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good.
[437:43.41]Alright, so now let's take it back this way.
[437:49.96]I've got some Titans.
[437:51.96]I've got... I can... I'm gonna tele... Listen.
[437:54.22]Watch this shit.
[437:55.61]I'm gonna teleport over here.
[437:57.43]And then I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna get blue and I'm gonna get fucking red.
[438:00.53]I'm gonna kill red.
[438:01.53]Listen to me.
[438:01.93]What's wrong with me?
[438:02.53]I'm like fucking freaking out.
[438:10.43]He's turning mad!
[438:26.29]This is great.
[438:28.61]Okay.
[438:30.92]Would like to recruit gremlins?
[438:32.20]No.
[438:37.32]Just... This is all I got.
[438:48.37]Yeah, blue is... I have to scoop up.
[438:52.27]I gotta go around and I have to scoop up.
[438:55.38]I'm not going to leave this place undefended.
[438:59.06]This one is... Alright, hold on a minute.
[439:01.90]I need money.
[439:11.66]He can't do anything.
[439:13.20]He's fucked.
[439:14.97]He's screwed.
[439:16.07]This is perfect.
[439:19.07]That's so awesome.
[439:25.51]Four crystals.
[439:27.37]Alright, let me get the lumberyard.
[439:29.67]This is so stupid.
[439:38.11]Uh-oh.
[439:39.51]They're getting in their boats.
[439:41.68]Alright, I got all the resources.
[439:51.70]Now let's get over here, and I'm gonna teleport this way.
[439:55.56]Oh, but how am I doing on, um... I feel like I should... I'm gonna get some more genies.
[440:03.37]I'm gonna get four titans.
[440:07.63]More of these.
[440:10.71]Let's not rush here.
[440:11.71]Hold on.
[440:18.65]I can't believe I've been on this camp.
[440:19.89]This, like, random campaign for fucking seven and a half hours.
[440:29.98]Should I just farm titans?
[440:34.34]266 skeletons.
[440:39.41]Three.
[440:41.99]More mages.
[440:46.73]Yeah, I'm just gonna sit out here, man.
[440:49.47]I'm gonna be the biggest piece of shit ever.
[440:53.23]I'm gonna be the biggest fucking piece of crap ever.
[440:55.15]I'm just gonna skip every single turn.
[440:59.30]What is going to speed click?
[441:05.33]Purple on land?
[441:11.03]Oh.
[441:14.11]He's dead.
[441:16.05]Archers, hoard a pet.
[441:18.23]You're dead.
[441:21.35]Get over here.
[441:21.73]Let's go.
[441:22.37]I'll kill you all.
[441:40.32]He's coming up.
[441:41.92]Okay.
[441:44.32]He's dead.
[442:30.15]I got better dragons Berserk on the dragon Kill the archers
[443:00.82]Get the fuck out of here.
[443:01.96]I just burnt the fucking tent down.
[443:10.60]I win.
[443:20.16]Slowly but surely I'm going to kill all of purple and I'm gonna win.
[443:24.54]It's a war of attrition at this point.
[443:26.84]I'm gonna win.
[443:47.90]I'm gonna pick the handsome guy.
[443:49.04]Okay.
[444:09.88]Remember.
[444:10.20]Let's go.
[444:21.97]Are you seriously bringing another guy over here?
[444:28.11]Several packs, several fuse, several... They keep respawning and coming back to me.
[444:39.62]This is fucking awesome.
[444:43.37]I need more money, though.
[444:44.91]My resources aren't terrible.
[444:47.61]Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[444:51.35]Okay, I'm gonna go... That came out of nowhere.
[444:53.83]I'm gonna teleport over here.
[444:57.62]I'm going this way.
[445:00.82]And I'm gonna go swoop by red.
[445:03.36]I still have a ton of units.
[445:16.44]I'm one more week, and then I'm going to teleport over there.
[445:29.20]Somebody's coming over here, though.
[445:31.31]Oh, they have to fucking do that right now.
[445:36.05]It's this guy.
[445:38.17]I don't know if I can leave yet.
[445:40.39]Because if I teleport here, I can swoop around.
[445:42.45]I don't even have this viewed yet.
[445:49.69]Stupid tax bullshit.
[445:56.47]No, I gotta wait another day.
[446:04.93]Here you come.
[446:05.75]Here you come.
[446:06.65]Okay, I gotta be ready for this.
[446:07.78]What do you think?
[446:16.18]Two titans and then replace it with skeletons.
[446:34.39]I don't have any money.
[446:38.69]I need two crystals.
[446:40.09]I need, okay, I need two, like, nerds.
[446:43.35]5,000.
[446:43.37]5,000 gold.
[446:43.89]I have, I need, alright, okay, here we go.
[446:46.47]I'm gonna sell some shit.
[446:54.08]Where's the market here?
[446:55.58]Down here?
[446:55.92]Where the fuck is it?
[446:59.24]Artifact merchant?
[447:00.06]What the hell is this?
[447:02.97]Defense.
[447:04.09]Wroth.
[447:06.09]Kot.
[447:07.25]Mercury.
[447:07.99]No.
[447:10.95]Where's the merchant down here?
[447:11.97]I didn't fucking have one?
[447:22.54]Am I insane?
[447:23.72]Where is it?
[447:24.08]Oh, okay.
[447:27.18]I want this.
[447:27.70]I'll give you crystals.
[448:05.30]Alright.
[448:08.12]This is a good troop of people.
[448:12.04]I need a capital, too.
[448:12.98]Fuck, I do.
[448:13.72]You're right.
[448:15.05]I gotta kill this person, though.
[448:17.51]They keep sending them up here.
[448:33.22]What is that?
[448:35.91]A behemoth?
[448:38.69]Target enemy's defense is reduced by 40%.
[448:41.03]This is like a Chad orc.
[448:50.16]Not that scary, actually.
[448:51.06]Just go for the... Berserk on the behemoth.
[448:56.72]Why the... On his legs?
[448:59.13]Got it.
[448:59.43]Okay.
[449:01.31]And then we're gonna go right over to the... The magi's.
[449:07.02]No.
[449:08.58]Yeah.
[449:16.08]No, that's too close.
[449:19.38]Down here.
[449:19.86]The birds.
[449:23.94]One hit kill.
[449:26.37]Buff.
[449:27.49]Buff.
[449:28.95]Nice.
[449:30.27]Titan.
[449:31.53]Up top.
[449:36.61]Wolves.
[449:42.12]Magi.
[449:43.56]Defend.
[449:49.18]Got it.
[449:50.19]I win again.
[450:10.07]No, I need to make a citadel.
[450:11.15]Stop making people.
[450:14.19]Make some genies.
[450:14.85]Alright, that's it.
[450:20.30]I need a citadel.
[450:30.00]He keeps retreating and you're killing the useless units.
[450:32.54]Well, the units don't stick around.
[450:34.10]5300.
[450:35.26]Does this have a citadel?
[450:39.66]It doesn't have... Okay, I need... I'm gonna have two more capitals here.
[450:47.22]Four thou... Okay, I just gotta get to 20,000 gold.
[450:52.30]Everybody leave me the fuck alone.
[450:54.54]Nobody come up here.
[450:55.76]Purple... I just killed, like, three of Purple's heroes.
[451:02.57]10,000.
[451:03.25]Let's get it right here.
[451:05.17]Capital building.
[451:05.87]4,000 gold today.
[451:10.45]See you next week.
[451:25.84]8,000 now.
[451:27.54]We're getting there.
[451:28.10]We're getting there.
[451:29.66]And I'm going to stack Titans.
[451:33.07]It's going to be embarrassing how many I have.
[451:34.87]At least 30.
[451:35.17]I've got to get the wood.
[451:41.68]What about this one?
[451:42.86]It's still mine.
[451:43.35]Am I going to do anything with the other dude?
[451:53.51]Yes.
[451:54.97]But first I need to get that other building.
[451:56.79]I need to get a capital in that other castle, so.
[452:00.65]Imp growth, familiar growth.
[452:03.27]So I need a capital in here.
[452:05.33]Oh, there already is one.
[452:09.25]I can't build more than one capital.
[452:12.25]Shit shit shit shit.
[452:16.59]I can't do it Shit oh well oh shit oh I need the money though so bad oh
[452:41.29]Oh, God damn it!
[452:46.55]Two more Titans.
[452:47.31]I got it.
[452:48.03]It's still going.
[452:48.99]I'm not going to bed.
[452:50.67]No, I don't care.
[452:51.94]Oh, God damn it, man.
[452:59.92]Shit, I can't believe this motherfucker's coming over after me.
[453:03.54]Oh, shit!
[453:09.26]What the fuck am I doing?
[453:18.35]I got the sofa for free.
[453:19.49]I'm just gonna sit here and grind.
[453:23.59]This stream is never going to end.
[453:25.79]But here's the worst part, guys.
[453:27.09]Let's say this is like a 12-hour stream.
[453:29.71]Okay?
[453:32.51]I have to eventually go over here.
[453:34.64]Otherwise, I don't win.
[453:38.58]Yeah, I understand.
[453:39.28]I eventually... Everything... All everything ends at Ares.
[453:44.22]I'm going in there with 50 titans.
[453:50.83]It's the only way to win.
[453:53.15]I'm telling you, this is the strategy here.
[453:55.69]Alright.
[453:56.99]Let me... Let me hang out in here.
[453:58.48]Let's... Eight titans.
[454:04.84]I just need money.
[454:05.64]Look at how much stuff there is to buy.
[454:14.39]Get the reveal map spell?
[454:17.03]Do I even have one?
[454:20.16]Of course, tax day.
[454:21.18]Bullshit.
[454:32.83]Lookout tower.
[454:34.93]I don't have five wood.
[454:45.59]I have to go on an expedition.
[454:47.63]It's inevitable.
[454:48.17]I have to.
[454:49.87]Anybody up here?
[454:52.17]I don't see anybody up here, I have to go on an expedition I'm teleporting over here I can always go back Puzzle pieces
[455:18.55]Oh, witch hut.
[455:20.18]Okay, we got a rally point.
[455:23.64]Luck up.
[455:24.62]A thousand experience right here.
[455:25.91]Oh!
[455:27.97]Uh-oh!
[455:28.97]Oh!
[455:48.72]He ain't gonna come at me.
[455:50.34]That's the other guy that's really strong.
[455:52.34]No, he's not here.
[455:52.88]Okay.
[455:53.38]What can I do?
[455:56.28]He's not gonna come after me.
[455:57.62]I'm strong.
[456:12.60]I want a new save.
[456:40.46]Whoa, did red just kill somebody?
[456:42.78]Did he just kill purple?
[456:44.58]What does he have in there?
[456:48.64]Wait!
[456:55.94]He brought a boat!
[456:56.74]He brought a boat!
[456:57.54]He brought a fucking boat over here!
[457:03.72]A boat.
[457:05.04]Not good.
[457:05.52]I have to turn around, I think.
[457:07.16]But there's an island.
[457:10.15]But I've already been to this island, so what are you doing?
[457:13.23]Wait, but there's an island!
[457:14.47]Yeah, the middle island that I've been to a thousand times.
[457:19.55]No, go back, back, back, back, back.
[457:21.17]Ares is back.
[457:23.67]Oh my god!
[457:31.42]Oh, okay, for a second, I thought this was 68 dragons.
[457:39.22]I can take this.
[457:54.70]I'm thinking of implosion.
[457:58.06]Implosion on... the angels?
[458:02.70]Or, I wonder, on the zealots?
[458:09.97]Or the archers?
[458:15.81]Yeah, that was an absolute destructive thing that I just did.
[458:18.49]Thank God.
[458:19.13]Alright.
[458:30.97]50, 200... 40 to 50, 250.
[458:31.37]No, I gotta... I gotta whittle... I gotta blow you down.
[458:36.23]I don't think I go anywhere.
[458:46.18]Unless maybe... Go in.
[458:51.78]Damn!
[458:54.36]That was not what I thought was gonna happen.
[459:04.33]Can I buff you?
[459:04.91]Okay, good.
[459:06.53]Magic Mirror.
[459:11.51]Who do I throw this at?
[459:14.68]Angels?
[459:20.74]Oh, they can fucking fly.
[459:24.76]This is terrible.
[459:25.74]This is really bad.
[459:30.25]Angel has to die now.
[459:31.69]Dragons are dead.
[459:32.39]I got no more dragons anymore.
[459:33.33]They're gone.
[459:45.08]We gotta go twice.
[459:46.00]That sucks.
[459:49.86]Oh my god.
[459:52.67]I'm exiting the game.
[459:54.89]This is not part of the plan.
[459:57.11]Not part of the plan.
[459:58.13]I'm not doing it.
[460:02.90]I had to fight the one dickhead in the ocean.
[460:06.80]Watch this be the only thing he has.
[460:18.55]Angel's dead.
[460:19.07]Those things are strong.
[460:29.62]Got 200.
[460:29.86]Let's just go in the back here.
[460:33.26]This is gonna be good. 36.
[460:51.91]Okay, Genie.
[460:54.99]Genie's right in front of you.
[460:56.41]You have to try.
[460:57.30]You got nothing.
[460:58.02]15 to 8.
[461:03.10]You keep going.
[461:06.37]Nice.
[461:08.31]If there's something substantial that I get from this, then I'm going to redo it.
[461:22.42]You know, if I get the chest piece of immortality or something, then maybe.
[461:27.04]Because I think I'm going to win.
[461:39.27]Pretty good bait here.
[461:46.91]That's it for the horses.
[461:49.81]Now you take care of this.
[462:02.99]That's it.
[462:04.61]10,000 experience.
[462:07.54]Defense.
[462:08.58]Expert learning.
[462:11.18]And... Nothing.
[462:17.78]Nothing.
[462:21.12]Here comes fucking Ares.
[462:22.32]Um... Here's the thing, though.
[462:26.91]This is... I could get rid of red...
[462:35.93]I could delete Red right now.
[462:42.71]I don't think Red has another castle.
[462:48.08]This is empty.
[462:48.44]There's nothing in here.
[462:51.76]Unless there's something down here.
[462:53.26]No, that's not part of the plan.
[462:57.41]Load game.
[463:05.34]This is before I even teleported over, right?
[463:11.38]No, it's not.
[463:11.74]What the hell is going on?
[463:12.80]No.
[463:13.20]Wrong one.
[463:18.86]Okay.
[463:20.14]So, this is where I'm going to go back.
[463:22.08]I'm going to teleport back.
[463:34.47]So then if I don't do that, let's see where the timeline is.
[463:38.79]He still gets in the boat.
[463:41.83]Red is now here.
[463:45.30]Which now Red is going to end up potentially taking this castle.
[463:48.46]At least I got the resources.
[463:53.06]Alright, teleport over here.
[463:53.88]I need to walk.
[464:00.22]Spell cancel, get up here.
[464:07.57]Back it up.
[464:18.93]I really want more dragons, but I don't think I have any access to them.
[464:22.35]That sucks.
[464:24.89]What do I have access to over here?
[464:27.49]Unfortunately, it's the same place.
[464:34.38]It's the same place.
[464:35.82]It's not different.
[464:40.68]I'm gonna have to just, like... Master Gremlins.
[464:46.24]Naga Queens.
[464:49.10]I mean, I'm gonna have to do something here.
[464:50.73]I could send somebody down here, but he's here.
[465:05.43]I really want that back.
[465:09.94]There's nothing there.
[465:10.64]Except he's here.
[465:12.38]He's got dragons.
[465:15.86]Double of the same production is not bad.
[465:17.44]No, that's not... Yeah, that's true.
[465:21.92]I'm going to send a scout out.
[465:26.03]Next week, I'm going to send a scout out to try to get blue.
[465:39.53]At least that castle on the right.
[465:43.68]And I'll start him here and get him... try to get him down here.
[465:47.02]There's nothing... there's nobody here.
[465:49.74]I can just get that back.
[465:51.35]Or this one.
[465:57.35]Day five.
[465:59.95]Still have the dragons.
[466:01.90]Titans.
[466:02.30]I'll have ten Titans.
[466:08.20]Still have all this stuff up here.
[466:09.60]Alright, let's go.
[466:10.40]Let's do that plan.
[466:11.50]Here we go.
[466:16.76]Wizard or Death Knight.
[466:20.24]He has an artifact.
[466:23.77]What is it?
[466:27.79]What's the artifact?
[466:30.01]Knowledge and power by three.
[466:31.23]Alright, let's give you just a couple of these things to go out with.
[466:38.22]I will keep the other ones that are for this building here.
[466:45.16]Go out this way.
[466:48.32]Grab a boat.
[466:50.36]And get the hell out of here.
[466:53.77]Basic Scouting.
[466:58.91]Ah.
[466:59.97]This one, definitely.
[467:05.41]Arena.
[467:05.85]This is where I get some points.
[467:08.67]I'm not gonna move, I'm gonna stay here.
[467:10.09]Oh fuck, he's coming my way.
[467:13.99]What does he got?
[467:15.77]Is it the same red that I fought before?
[467:17.18]I beat him.
[467:24.54]Yep, it is.
[467:25.14]Alright, well I'm getting in.
[467:43.56]I need a new hero.
[467:44.12]I might have to meet you halfway.
[467:49.62]I think I'm going to have to meet them halfway.
[467:58.87]Yep.
[467:59.97]I'm going to focus the zealots.
[468:01.48]There's no planks here.
[468:15.30]No, I'll make another hero.
[468:17.32]And I'm going to send this hero off.
[468:22.10]Absolutely this one.
[468:31.08]One knowledge.
[468:31.68]Okay, so then let's give you this.
[468:32.96]I'm going to give you something.
[468:35.27]I'll give you something just to get this to be out there.
[468:37.57]Just be alright.
[468:37.91]Alright.
[468:47.97]You back it in here.
[468:48.91]I want you behind the walls.
[468:53.55]You need to go recruit shit.
[468:56.15]Find your way around.
[469:00.13]Just walk by this guy.
[469:02.76]And I need to get in a boat and I'm going to go down.
[469:05.74]I'm going to go down here.
[469:06.42]I want nothing to do with you, man.
[469:15.05]+2 attack.
[469:20.06]Alright.
[469:21.52]Same deal with you.
[469:23.96]Down this way.
[469:28.32]Here we go.
[469:29.22]Let's see what happens.
[469:29.80]He's coming in for a fight.
[469:31.26]Alright.
[469:31.54]He wants to get rid of this guy.
[469:32.61]Alright.
[469:32.85]Well, this is good bait.
[469:34.91]This is really good bait.
[469:36.61]I'm okay with this.
[469:37.21]It gets rid of the centaurs and it makes him not attack the house.
[469:46.08]Everyone's just gonna die.
[469:50.30]We just wasted money?
[469:57.53]I know, fuck, you're right.
[470:01.43]I- I just- I didn't think he was gonna fucking... I thought he was gonna- I didn't think he was gonna fucking come back and kill me.
[470:20.14]I thought he was gonna... Okay, he's gonna go back to back.
[470:25.30]Back to back and kill everybody.
[470:27.14]Hey, remember that money that I lost?
[470:39.99]I'm just... I got... I can't even... I shouldn't even spend any money on any of the towns.
[470:44.91]Because... This is not possible to beat.
[470:48.44]Unless I have an equal or better force, which I can't do.
[470:52.62]I can't.
[470:55.10]It's... I can't do it.
[470:56.12]I have to... I'm gonna... I don't give a shit if they... Just take it all.
[470:59.39]I'm gonna just turtle the fuck out of one place.
[471:06.80]and just get 25 titans and then win.
[471:10.06]God damn it.
[471:25.85]I need to stop, like, putting money into three or four different places.
[471:29.05]I just need to do it in one place.
[471:35.97]This is gonna... this whole... this same scenario is gonna play out over and over again.
[471:46.94]Or I just lose, because he keeps going to the capital.
[471:52.88]God damn it.
[471:56.81]Let's... I wanna see what happens.
[472:10.12]I made like three other heroes.
[472:12.03]I should have just sat in my fucking castle and just banked money and then had like a bunch of people.
[472:34.80]I'm making that same mistake again.
[472:50.80]Well, the only reason I thought I was gonna win is because I thought Ares was stuck forever.
[472:54.28]But then, it didn't matter.
[472:55.76]Because then Red decided to grow a brain and move from this island to over here.
[473:03.90]It's taken him eight hours to get here.
[473:12.50]What were you doing all this time?
[473:21.15]Alright, let's see.
[473:21.91]Let's check this new scenario.
[473:23.13]Let's see what happens now.
[473:28.91]I need to, like... I gotta, like, build this place up.
[473:31.98]Alright.
[473:33.76]This is what I was doing, right?
[473:36.24]Naga Queens.
[473:37.70]I can now make them here, which is good.
[473:40.36]I can now get them to be made here.
[473:45.40]I'm going to do...
[473:49.83]Cloud Temple.
[473:51.23]So I need Author of Wishes.
[474:00.15]I don't have... I have no money to make anything else.
[474:06.86]What did I just say?
[474:07.70]No, no, no.
[474:08.72]But I made like three new heroes.
[474:11.00]I spent like almost ten grand on new heroes.
[474:13.18]I'm not doing that.
[474:16.68]I'm just trying to recruit people now.
[474:22.78]You know what I mean?
[474:23.26]Like, see, I can make the genies.
[474:26.48]And now we go again.
[474:36.51]I've got a plan.
[474:37.69]And in the same scenario, he keeps coming back.
[474:41.61]Alright.
[474:44.00]I can do this now.
[474:44.90]Altar of Wishes, and then we can do them here.
[474:50.36]Now I can make upgraded genies.
[474:53.76]And by the way, like, delete this guy.
[475:00.29]What is that?
[475:00.71]That guy serves no purpose.
[475:07.65]Alright.
[475:09.07]Even more.
[475:10.37]And then we're going to dump them together.
[475:11.81]And this guy's going to just ride his horse off a cliff for all I care.
[475:20.67]Okay, looks alright.
[475:23.11]Okay, let's go.
[475:25.03]Save it.
[475:37.01]Okay, here we go.
[475:45.33]So here comes Red.
[475:46.47]If I'm behind my walls, he won't kill me.
[475:51.67]Here comes Ares.
[475:55.63]Everyone is recruited from here.
[475:58.77]This place is looking alright.
[476:00.91]Okay, now.
[476:02.43]Cloud Temple.
[476:03.09]I need 5,000 gold.
[476:04.45]I also need 10 wood, 10 ore, and 10 marbles.
[476:11.51]So I just need some wood.
[476:13.15]And then we can start generating titans here.
[476:16.98]So let's just make as many of these as we can.
[476:18.96]I'm out of cash right now.
[476:21.82]I kind of have to get out here.
[476:26.81]I'm going to have to get out and get the wood again.
[476:29.93]Alright, first of all, get in the castle.
[476:34.61]Because if he comes over to the castle, I'm going to die.
[476:37.95]So what do I do with these?
[476:39.57]I said I wasn't going to make another hero.
[476:43.13]Do I just delete them?
[476:51.38]I think I have to just delete them.
[476:56.61]Yeah, I have to dismiss them.
[476:57.77]I'm not going to use them.
[477:04.75]Sell them for resources.
[477:07.45]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[477:10.85]Where is that building?
[477:16.98]Where is that building?
[477:18.72]Do I even have it here?
[477:25.25]Resource silo?
[477:26.29]No.
[477:27.85]What is it called?
[477:33.23]Do I have it in this town?
[477:39.26]Not a tavern.
[477:43.18]Um, a... Blacksmith.
[477:49.59]No.
[477:49.83]I don't think I have it here.
[477:53.95]Stronghold's the only faction that gets a building to sell units.
[477:56.25]Ah, dammit.
[477:56.61]It's only in the orcs' stronghold.
[478:00.37]Well.
[478:01.09]Oh well.
[478:02.37]Wait, what?
[478:03.55]What do you mean I do have it?
[478:05.21]Where is it?
[478:14.24]No, just kidding.
[478:15.10]Thanks!
[478:18.70]Skeletons aren't worth it.
[478:23.99]Just delete the skeletons?
[478:31.67]I feel like the skeletons can be pretty good sometimes, though.
[478:37.12]It's not worth making a new hero and just having him just go die.
[478:40.48]I'm just gonna dismiss him.
[478:47.73]Three, two, one, I'm doing it.
[478:58.23]Has chat been right before?
[478:59.59]Quite a few times, actually.
[479:01.41]Yeah, they have.
[479:01.95]They've been right before.
[479:05.25]Okay.
[479:07.21]How are we doing here?
[479:09.09]I need wood.
[479:10.07]I gotta take back the fucking wood.
[479:20.47]Motherfucker.
[479:22.81]Where is he?
[479:25.85]Go get wood!
[479:29.72]I need this.
[479:36.94]Just don't pop out of nowhere and kill me.
[479:41.36]You know how upset I'll be if that happens.
[479:48.53]I don't have the new genie, right?
[479:50.23]If I can get these guys.
[479:52.89]Okay.
[479:55.35]Starting to build a decent army on the other side here.
[479:59.02]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[480:09.57]I can beat him.
[480:11.43]I'm gonna go hard on the Zealots.
[480:17.29]The Angels, they have so many good fucking units.
[480:20.20]I think I should go hard on Zealots.
[480:25.08]Start off with Implosion on the Zealots.
[480:33.34]Or should I Berserk?
[480:36.55]Berserk the Zealots?
[480:44.15]There's so many options.
[480:52.50]Either Berserk the Zealots, Implode the Zealots.
[481:02.71]12, 7 to 10, 2 to 3, 15 to 25, I could do that.
[481:10.36]They do way more damage.
[481:16.50]Yeah, I think I'm gonna Berserk the, um, the capital right here.
[481:24.07]They do more damage.
[481:25.33]And then I'm just gonna go hard onto the Zealot.
[481:31.25]with Dragon and with Titan.
[481:51.11]Get out of here!
[481:52.31]You're ruining everything because I'm going to deplete all of my fucking forces on this.
[482:04.13]This is like the same thing that happened, except at a different part of the map.
[482:07.33]They just... I just don't... I didn't do it.
[482:09.47]It was the first three hours of the game.
[482:11.99]I just didn't get everything in the right position.
[482:14.67]I was still trying to learn and remember how to play, and I fucking peed on myself.
[482:19.43]Alright, well, get up here.
[482:24.67]I at least need to have somebody fight.
[482:45.36]And then I'm back to square one again.
[482:47.58]And then there's two or three other people that have huge armies.
[482:54.00]I think this is a retreat and give up.
[482:57.44]I think I lose here.
[482:58.88]I don't think it's possible that I can win.
[483:09.68]Even if I beat this, what am I gonna do?
[483:12.02]I'm behind in troops and resources by, like, 100%.
[483:19.37]I can win this fight, but then we start all over again where it's like, oh, here comes Ares with his 30 dragons.
[483:27.51]I'm fucked.
[483:43.19]Well, it was fun.
[483:45.77]Use spells?
[483:46.25]I couldn't use spells.
[483:48.19]This is the first round I've been able to use spells.
[483:50.77]Up until last time.
[483:51.47]We're gonna Berserk again.
[483:52.39]Let's Berserk the Angel.
[484:11.35]Get rid of them.
[484:12.03]Fight each other, kill each other!
[484:14.65]Okay.
[484:24.72]Good, look at the skeletons.
[484:26.46]That's perfect.
[484:29.36]Yep.
[484:30.40]Should be good.
[484:30.92]Go carve up the angel.
[484:36.09]This is a victory.
[484:41.49]He's melted the skeletons, holy shit.
[484:51.01]Kind of in trouble here.
[484:58.62]Whoa!
[484:59.46]Well, that's not good.
[485:04.58]Angel's dead.
[485:10.26]I'm going to wrap back around here.
[485:22.16]And they retreated.
[485:24.76]10,000 experience.
[485:25.98]I used blind.
[485:27.66]Cannot move.
[485:28.22]Cause it to counterattack at half its normal attack strength.
[485:32.38]Interesting.
[485:34.28]Let's get expert learning.
[485:36.95]So now I... What the hell am I gonna do now?
[485:39.85]I need more titans.
[485:41.35]Three crystals back here.
[485:50.38]Two more titans.
[485:52.80]Oh, they can only get one.
[486:04.13]I feel like we are probably going to be in a never-ending loop.
[486:12.60]I'm almost certain of it, actually.
[486:19.00]Epic 72-hour campaign.
[486:20.74]I'm essentially treading water at this point.
[486:26.16]Because they... He just has so much great stuff.
[486:31.87]I'm gonna give it like another week or a couple weeks and we'll see Because I just not really generating enough money and if I send people it's almost like I'm constantly swimming upstream And I think yeah, I just have to I think I just have to take somebody I got I'm gonna get I'll get ten Titans
[487:03.12]And I think I just have to go down here.
[487:05.18]And just try to steal something.
[487:06.26]Just try to get something.
[487:11.77]Let us recruit what we can recruit.
[487:13.31]And then I'm going to go from there.
[487:14.87]So let's do it.
[487:19.27]There are 18 of these over here.
[487:24.75]So what I'm going to do... What am I going to do here?
[487:34.43]Let's just see what happens.
[487:36.33]We've been going for, like, over eight hours now.
[487:38.39]It's probably time to wind it down.
[487:40.03]It's, like, midnight Pacific.
[487:43.98]I'm, like, too addicted to being in a never-ending circle.
[487:46.78]But it's all good.
[487:48.74]Let's do this.
[487:49.60]I'm just going to recruit whatever's left here.
[487:52.00]And then I'm going to head down.
[487:57.09]I need to wait a day.
[488:09.49]Of course, it's tax day.
[488:11.55]That's great.
[488:15.25]Ten titans, there we go.
[488:19.91]I hate that.
[488:33.88]There's still a few more in here.
[488:35.66]I'm gonna wait.
[488:36.56]If I'm gonna give it a real try, I'm gonna wait.
[488:46.10]Go until a year has passed.
[488:48.27]That'll be like another probably eight and a half hours.
[488:51.87]It's month six.
[488:55.67]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[489:00.63]Alright.
[489:11.87]Wizards.
[489:16.22]Alright, almost ready to go.
[489:18.36]I'm actually going to bring the other Naga Queens over.
[489:29.66]Don't even tell me he's fucking coming to get me.
[489:33.12]Oh, you motherfucker.
[489:34.80]No, let me have my...
[489:56.75]Don't you dare I need to like deliver these guys.
[489:59.83]Oh god damn it.
[490:04.64]I Need to just deliver people to here just do something else for a minute Do not come over here just do anything else for fucking five seconds One more turn don't even come over here
[490:23.89]Thank- What?
[490:29.68]Special goddamn delivery.
[490:33.02]Did he- I- What happened?
[490:37.06]He's got 21 dragons and 100 liches, 100 trees.
[490:41.30]This was never winnable anyway.
[490:43.23]He's just progressively gotten better and I've been treading water.
[490:46.83]No, it's not possible.
[490:48.49]But I'm going to go out with a bang and he's going to come get me and I'll let him take the fucking castle like a goddamn...
[491:10.57]He's unbeatable.
[491:18.03]Come on.
[491:19.37]Let's do it.
[491:19.83]E-end my, like, eight to ten hour stream here with me being fucking humiliated.
[491:26.82]Let's go.
[491:35.97]I'm gonna sit up here.
[491:36.75]Nah, they have too many.
[491:46.11]He's right outside the castle.
[492:50.33]This is it.
[492:50.99]It's over.
[492:52.45]He's gonna take his... his cheating dragons.
[492:55.23]Is there... is there a way... after this match is over, can I go, like, to a replay and see how the fuck he got these? ...
[493:19.40]Why would there be a replay option?
[493:20.96]Yeah, I know.
[493:32.27]Haha!
[493:36.03]You lost a... ...unicorn.
[493:55.58]He's not even gonna come get me, is he?
[493:56.90]Alright, I'll just be a piece of shit.
[494:12.58]What are you gonna do?
[494:14.04]You gonna come get me?
[494:17.00]This is it.
[494:20.26]The last stand before I actually lose.
[494:23.98]I lose the game.
[494:25.90]Oh, this is so sad.
[494:27.20]This is so sad to me.
[494:28.84]I was so pumped and excited.
[494:31.33]I have to get my revenge.
[494:33.21]I have to get my revenge tomorrow.
[494:35.61]I'm so sad.
[494:36.85]I'm very sad right now.
[494:38.63]I actually really am.
[494:39.65]Damn it.
[494:40.51]I really thought I had it.
[494:41.49]Okay.
[494:42.19]Alright, this is fun.
[494:52.10]This was fun.
[494:52.68]It was.
[494:56.87]Who do I even... What do I even do here?
[495:01.48]Berserk on... I can't even do that.
[495:07.08]I have to implode somebody.
[495:08.96]Or... Let me try one of the... Oh, no, no.
[495:10.28]You know what?
[495:11.37]Let's get an Earth Elemental out here.
[495:15.73]Oh, this thing sucks.
[495:16.65]Never mind.
[495:21.19]Going for the dragon.
[495:24.65]Holy shit.
[495:26.42]Wow.
[495:27.22]Wait a minute.
[495:28.06]Wow.
[495:28.46]That was very, very, very, very good.
[495:34.04]Should I go out there and kill the dragon?
[495:40.31]Six dragons dead!
[495:56.08]What a waste.
[495:57.92]No, he's got too many good.
[495:59.64]At least let me kill the dragons.
[496:02.85]Let me just get rid of these dragons.
[496:04.41]I hate them.
[496:21.64]Ninety.
[496:23.66]Alright.
[496:28.44]Titans.
[496:30.46]Five dragons perish.
[496:36.41]What's going on?
[496:37.65]Oh, you're dispelling all the mines.
[496:39.03]That's kind of ridiculous.
[496:39.97]If I kill the bone dragons, this is a victory.
[496:44.09]There's only... There's only four left.
[496:51.09]I win.
[496:51.33]That's a victory for me.
[497:04.32]No, not my city.
[497:07.07]Not my capital.
[497:11.19]I want to play again.
[497:12.73]This time I'm going to do it much better and I'm going to be prepared.
[497:16.19]But not tonight.
[497:20.67]I will come back stronger.
[497:25.87]There goes everything.
[497:32.50]Is that me?
[497:44.70]No, what?
[497:45.30]They even do this to you?
[497:53.39]Oh, that sucks.
[497:58.77]Game over.
[498:01.18]Oh, no, it hurts.
[498:03.00]I'm like actually... Ugh.
[498:26.01]No, I'm not doing round two right now.
[498:28.61]I'm just gonna have... I'm gonna have mayhem for tomorrow.
[498:34.72]Team alignments.
[498:36.20]No teams.
[498:36.86]Maybe we should do teams.
[498:37.92]What do you think?
[498:39.86]Tomorrow should we... Like four on four?
[498:47.19]Eight teams.
[498:54.51]Large map, because, I mean, obviously it's eight people.
[498:59.79]I'm going to keep it at that 130%.
[499:00.71]I think that's good.
[499:02.47]It's fair.
[499:04.97]Monster strength.
[499:10.58]What was it?
[499:11.02]It was on strong.
[499:11.74]And it's a random map template.
[499:22.17]Normal water.
[499:25.54]What should we do?
[499:25.98]Pre-made scenarios.
[499:32.47]You have to prove.
[499:38.09]No water means no boats to worry about.
[499:39.95]That's true.
[499:45.16]Always build second level.
[499:46.24]Rebuild.
[499:46.70]Library.
[499:47.12]I don't know what that means.
[499:49.14]This is all.
[499:49.60]We can do this tomorrow.
[499:54.45]We'll set it up.
[499:56.07]Uh, yeah, that's gonna be it.
[499:59.07]Unfortunately, uh... I ran around in a circle for the last, like, three hours.
[500:04.90]But it was still a lot of fun.
[500:09.96]It's exactly like I remember.
[500:16.52]I have a sour taste in my mouth, but I will turn it into sweet candy tomorrow.
[500:23.23]Going for a win tomorrow.
[500:29.20]And then after tomorrow... After tomorrow, I am going to take a little bit of time off.
[500:36.44]I have to do my colonoscopy.
[500:38.54]I'm going to be kind of miserable over the next few days.
[500:40.86]I'm not going to be able to eat very much.
[500:46.12]But that will be it.
[500:47.24]I will see you tomorrow.
[500:48.15]Around the same time.
[500:50.05]Between 3 and 4 Pacific.
[500:53.01]Thank you for watching.
[500:53.77]This was Heroes of Might Magic 3.
[500:55.93]An old favorite of mine.
[501:00.41]Hopefully you guys thought it was fun.
[501:01.47]Because I know there was... Maybe people said, hmm, maybe not.
[501:04.39]I wonder.
[501:04.73]I've never seen that before.
[501:05.56]Is it boring?
[501:06.24]Is it not boring?
[501:12.44]But I think we definitely can do another stream on this.
[501:14.92]And we'll do it tomorrow.
[501:19.05]This game is fucking awesome.
[501:20.27]It's very fun.
[501:20.87]It's very intense.
[501:23.53]And I will see you tomorrow for the next part.
[501:28.79]Thanks again for watching.
[501:29.55]We're going to do the bits and subs when I return.
[501:32.81]Because I need to use the bathroom.
[501:34.59]I'm not going to pee.
[501:37.04]Much love to you.
[501:37.50]If you're taking off, maybe you'll stop by tomorrow.
[501:39.90]See you soon.
[501:40.22]I'll be right back.
[502:09.91]you
[502:44.79]you
[503:19.73]you
[503:58.01]Okay.
[504:03.29]So, let's go back to a long time ago, almost a whole day away.
[504:12.54]We're going to go back to Gnarly.
[504:16.20]Thanks for the $6, Gnarly62.
[504:17.68]Thanks, man.
[504:19.53]Appreciate the comfort.
[504:23.05]My pleasure.
[504:23.93]Thanks for watching.
[504:28.72]Thank you for the $6.
[504:33.30]Appreciate it.
[504:33.76]Thank you.
[504:35.52]Some guy thanks for the $15.
[504:36.50]I don't have any message.
[504:38.00]Here's a dog.
[504:38.70]A dog.
[504:50.93]Is this a dog running after a guy?
[504:52.45]That's not Otto.
[504:57.89]No, it's a different dog.
[504:59.69]Auto, no.
[505:03.11]Auto, I think, is probably asleep.
[505:05.65]Because it's midnight.
[505:07.69]I don't think Auto is awake at the moment.
[505:16.05]Auto attacking Ares.
[505:18.15]Nah, let Auto sleep.
[505:19.11]Auto doesn't need to be awoken.
[505:22.80]But thank you for the $15 sum, guy.
[505:26.54]Thanks.
[505:26.92]Appreciate the dog run video.
[505:31.14]Thank you.
[505:34.12]Thank you, Warm Like Biscuits, for the $10.
[505:36.48]$15 and $10 right after it earlier today.
[505:41.39]Jerm, I've been watching you since early TF2 days, and I have to thank you for all the laughs and joy you have brought me through the years.
[505:46.97]I've had pretty dark nights, and your videos always made them a little easier.
[505:50.30]So thank you.
[505:54.10]Thank you.
[505:56.83]I love Team Fortress.
[505:58.37]I loved making YouTube videos.
[506:02.48]I'm very, very happy that people enjoyed them and thought they were fun and may have helped them forget about some shit in their life.
[506:09.60]You know what I'm saying?
[506:11.52]That's... That means a lot.
[506:16.12]Thank you for the $10.
[506:17.14]Thank you for the fucking incredibly kind message.
[506:24.35]Much love to you.
[506:24.87]Thank you, Warm Like Biscuits.
[506:29.80]Really appreciate it.
[506:31.98]Multitrip, thank you for the three bucks.
[506:33.58]Good god, this is such a geeky nerd-neck game.
[506:41.79]Just made me crack my neck to make sure that I was not sitting inappropriately.
[506:46.79]Uh, thank you for the three dollars.
[506:52.62]Thank you, Matt!
[506:54.25]PT, or Piety for the 250, thrilled to see you playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[506:59.01]Some of my earliest memories as a kid are sitting on my mom's lap and watching her play Might and Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic on her computer.
[507:08.11]Then abusing the hell out of cheats when I started playing myself since I was so bad at it.
[507:13.39]I joined right as you were complaining about losing a battle and loaded a save to redo it.
[507:18.49]That's the Jerma we all know and love.
[507:20.31]I want to watch from the beginning, so I'll be checking out the recording later.
[507:23.58]Keep being a cool guy.
[507:26.54]Thank you.
[507:28.08]I do have very fond memories of this game.
[507:31.80]Okay, maybe we can put a... Maybe tomorrow I won't do any rewinds.
[507:35.47]I'm just trying to get back to the swing of things, trying to remember how to play the game, trying to remember how things work.
[507:40.13]Now I got a good idea as to how things are working.
[507:42.63]Again, it's been like 15 years.
[507:47.13]Maybe we don't do rewinds tomorrow.
[507:48.45]Maybe we just have to accept our fate.
[507:52.51]What is the worst sound of 2019?
[507:53.65]Let me find an article that says it.
[508:00.92]Let me find an article that says it.
[508:07.44]Let me find an article.
[508:08.84]Let me find an article that says it.
[508:17.85]What the fuck?
[508:23.71]Thank you for the 250, though.
[508:25.03]Appreciate it, Matt.
[508:26.99]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the three bucks.
[508:29.46]Cheer300, no message.
[508:30.38]Thank you for the three dollars.
[508:32.76]Onikus, thanks for the ten dollars.
[508:35.66]Thank you, Onikus.
[508:38.04]Dude, just wanted to show a little bit of support.
[508:39.44]Been watching your videos for years.
[508:40.58]Just starting to come to streams.
[508:42.36]Thank you for all the laughs.
[508:44.22]Thank you, Onikus.
[508:49.33]Really appreciate the $10.
[508:52.07]Appreciate the support.
[508:53.23]Thanks for watching for that much time.
[508:56.72]I'm super thankful that people years later still think that this channel is fun.
[509:04.61]You know, if you watch the same thing for a few years, maybe sometimes you can kind of get sick of it or something you don't really like anymore.
[509:11.40]So I'm floored that people have been able to think this is still fun and cool and interesting over the last few years if you've been around for that long or five years, whatever.
[509:24.88]You always say you're going, then stick around for an hour.
[509:27.76]Well, when a stream ends, and this is going to be changing once I, uh, Lordal makes the new, uh, graphics.
[509:35.12]When I say a stream is ending, I really mean the stream is transitioning into a, like, 30 to 45 minute hangout session, where we just hang out.
[509:44.97]So the stream is technically over, but it still goes on for a little while.
[509:53.99]Yeah, yeah, it's... Yeah, the gaming is done, and I go through the messages that came through over the course of the evening.
[510:04.96]I don't, I'm not sure how, maybe how new you are or how many streams you've caught, but I don't read subs or donations or anything like that on stream.
[510:16.45]I will stop for something major, you know, if somebody gives, you know, 5, 10, 20 community subs, obviously that's a big deal, it's a lot of money, or like 50 bucks or 100 bucks, that's a big deal.
[510:29.26]But, for the most part, I just, we kind of just do the broadcast, and then we do a little hangout session afterwards.
[510:37.38]Gamer cooldown, yeah.
[510:38.88]There'll be a new screen, this won't say stream over in a week or so.
[510:42.84]I'll have some new graphics, some new music.
[510:46.24]So it will not just be over.
[510:50.21]It'll say something else.
[510:54.59]But it seems to have been working pretty well over the last couple of years.
[510:58.21]I heavily enjoy it.
[510:59.14]I like doing it.
[511:01.68]It takes a lot of the stress and the kind of need to stay on top of things like subs and donations.
[511:09.44]I like this better.
[511:11.69]Let's just focus on the stream and then have like a good 45 minute session to go over everything.
[511:18.63]How does DNA work?
[511:20.29]Um, you swab a thing in your mouth.
[511:23.62]And then you, uh, import it.
[511:28.08]Uh, but thank you to Profit Rocket for the five dollars.
[511:31.38]Hey Jerma, long time fan.
[511:32.42]First time giving you bits.
[511:33.86]I poorly animated part of one of your streams.
[511:36.08]Hope you get a chance to see it.
[511:37.25]Thanks for all the laughs.
[511:38.09]Let's fail it.
[511:41.44]Wrong button.
[511:42.86]Let's look at it.
[511:43.36]Okay, poorly animated.
[511:44.64]I don't agree with you.
[511:49.76]I don't fucking agree with you.
[511:51.66]I don't agree.
[511:52.76]No, neither do I. Let's put this on.
[512:01.59]This is, he said, I poorly animated you doing a portion of this stream.
[512:05.67]Let's see what it is.
[512:06.55]I don't agree.
[512:08.49]No, neither do I.
[512:10.83]I don't fucking agree with you.
[512:11.89]Where'd my browser go?
[512:13.13]Yeah, you're an idiot.
[512:15.03]An imbecile.
[512:15.55]I'm sorry, but I disagree.
[512:16.91]No, you should not be trusted ever.
[512:18.49]Absolutely.
[512:19.25]I'm not entirely sure about this.
[512:20.07]I don't agree.
[512:20.83]No, neither do I. I don't agree with you.
[512:23.19]I don't fucking agree with you.
[512:24.31]I totally disagree.
[512:26.06]Yeah, you're an idiot.
[512:27.40]An imbecile.
[512:27.90]I'm sorry, but I disagree.
[512:29.28]No, you should not be trusted ever.
[512:30.86]Absolutely not.
[512:31.82]No, you get out of my house.
[512:32.92]How about that?
[512:33.38]I invited you over here.
[512:34.26]I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
[512:35.16]You took the fucking bus here, lady.
[512:37.02]That's not right.
[512:37.86]Yeah, and you asked for directions, and I tried to give you directions.
[512:39.78]That's not always true.
[512:40.77]No, yes it is, because I gave you directions earlier and you didn't care.
[512:43.22]Yes, it was what happened, so stop fucking interrupting me.
[512:45.76]That is what happened, so stop fucking interrupting me.
[512:48.36]Yes, it is.
[512:50.58]You knocked on my door and you asked for fucking directions to a button.
[512:55.45]Are you following me?
[512:57.97]Do you understand what I mean?
[512:59.25]I'm not entirely sure about this.
[513:03.83]No, neither do I. I don't fucking agree with you.
[513:07.31]I...
[513:11.95]I don't even fucking, like, I guess I vaguely remember that.
[513:20.32]That was fucking funny though.
[513:21.41]Thank you so much for that.
[513:23.63]That was pretty good.
[513:27.77]I missed the English tutorial channel.
[513:29.53]Didn't somebody say that they removed every video for some reason?
[513:32.65]Did we cause that to happen?
[513:34.88]Weren't there like a hundred views per video on that channel?
[513:38.54]Why did this community viewing those videos get them removed?
[513:48.16]I don't understand.
[513:48.90]Who else watched them?
[513:53.65]Didn't each... Yeah, every single one of the videos on that channel had less than a hundred views.
[514:01.55]It's odd.
[514:01.89]I don't know why.
[514:07.36]That's interesting.
[514:09.36]But!
[514:10.96]Thank you.
[514:11.18]That was Prophet Rocket for the five dolls and that little animation.
[514:17.13]Little moving comic book.
[514:18.17]Thank you for that.
[514:22.31]Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[514:23.67]Ares is basically Hannibal.
[514:25.57]Also, he needs to be in the next Rumble.
[514:27.98]Yeah, I'm gonna give him zero stats.
[514:29.14]I'm gonna eliminate him first.
[514:36.47]I feel so... I feel so unfulfilled.
[514:39.51]I need to win tomorrow.
[514:47.27]I didn't cheat.
[514:48.59]I may have rewound a few times, but... I wasn't gonna cheat to win.
[514:52.55]I have to win for real.
[514:57.21]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[514:59.61]Thank you, Clowers... Clowers...
[515:02.80]Clowers V. Clowers for the 250.
[515:05.04]Thank you.
[515:07.42]Lads, bought Jupiters have been flooding the market recently.
[515:10.44]Liquidate all of your Jerma Jupiter and Jerma Jupiter 4, Jerma Jupiter 3 and 4, and invest exclusively in jermaSaturn now.
[515:18.21]I have a feeling jermaSaturn will be the next big thing.
[515:20.83]Please trust me because Jerma985 himself is reading this right now and he wouldn't lie to you.
[515:30.43]Jerma wouldn't lie.
[515:31.43]That should be another one.
[515:32.25]Jerma told the truth about X. Where are those?
[515:35.79]I need some of those.
[515:39.49]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[515:41.64]And we only have a couple more, so let's get the credits on screen.
[515:48.40]Get them up there.
[515:49.38]Roll them.
[515:53.04]About to reach the over a... Just about under nine hours.
[515:58.71]Cool.
[516:02.46]I like just doing this sometimes.
[516:05.94]I feel like I've gotten so comfy that I like just sitting here and playing a game.
[516:10.57]It's fun.
[516:11.83]I like just sitting here and making units.
[516:15.37]I'm getting more comfortable with these streams.
[516:23.42]Do you guys remember how rare it was when I would have a stream?
[516:26.92]Maybe like a year or two ago?
[516:30.48]Did I ever have a stream, like, two years ago that went over four or five hours?
[516:34.16]I don't think ever.
[516:34.76]I used to do, like, yeah, like, max four hours.
[516:43.70]But that was a lot of fun.
[516:45.18]I know that near the end there we got a little late.
[516:51.34]So, sorry we're kind of pushing the midnight oil here.
[516:59.78]Now you read bits for four hours?
[517:01.06]Not anymore.
[517:03.18]We've only been here for like 20 minutes.
[517:05.52]That's why I raised the minimum.
[517:11.32]These have been going pretty smoothly too.
[517:13.12]I think that was a good call.
[517:14.48]I think it was a good idea.
[517:20.04]Hey, I wanted to ask you something for the longest time.
[517:21.80]Could you play a three minute ad?
[517:23.08]No.
[517:28.30]No, I'm not gonna play ads.
[517:37.67]I'll play ads tomorrow.
[517:39.00]I promise.
[517:46.28]But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[517:47.44]I hope you really liked it.
[517:48.72]I mean, I know I'm not the best, like, strategy and kind of management player, but it really is such an old favorite of mine, especially when I was younger, so... Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[518:01.61]Maybe you'll stick around for tomorrow, if you're around.
[518:04.69]We'll try it again.
[518:05.21]There's still a couple more bits to do.
[518:09.17]There's Buttery... Buttery Raven, thanks for the bits.
[518:16.58]This game is making me cry real tears.
[518:21.00]It was my childhood.
[518:27.23]Yeah, uh... Thanks for watching.
[518:36.12]There's a lot of cool shit in the game.
[518:38.78]There's mods, too.
[518:39.96]I have one of the community mods for HD and some bug fixes.
[518:48.34]Maybe if people like this and people want to see more of it, if we could do it again with some mods or change it up, or maybe I'll try to get multiplayer to work.
[518:56.51]I think that I might have to get the other version.
[519:01.27]Thanks for your tears.
[519:04.79]But thank you to all the subs, everybody.
[519:06.21]It was about, you know, almost a whole day here.
[519:12.79]Tons of you guys came in and subbed.
[519:14.03]Thank you.
[519:17.97]Much love to you.
[519:18.97]And finally, we had Espada Escarlata for the 250.
[519:25.00]Have one bit for every point of IQ, you fucking legend.
[519:28.22]250 IQ, that's high.
[519:34.30]I would remove like 110 points.
[519:35.06]No, way more than that.
[519:37.65]I would remove 135 points.
[519:38.33]I think that's more accurate.
[519:46.50]And then finally, the Jack.
[519:47.76]Thanks for the 250 from the Jack.
[519:51.52]So you get nothing!
[519:53.88]You lose!
[519:54.66]Good day, sir!
[519:57.22]I did lose.
[519:59.32]But that means I'm gonna come back stronger than ever.
[520:08.00]That was a lot of fun.
[520:08.56]Thanks for watching.
[520:09.16]I'll see you tomorrow.
[520:10.72]Tomorrow is the last stream for a few days.
[520:12.60]Um, hopefully I can come back here without being too messed up on, like, colonoscopy drugs.
[520:22.25]So, tomorrow and then I'll see you after tomorrow.
[520:29.05]Uh, well, technically Thursday.
[520:30.23]So, Friday, Saturday, and maybe Sunday I might be off.
[520:36.27]I'm gonna be pretty miserable.
[520:38.64]So after tomorrow, we'll talk about it again, but you'll see me on probably Monday.
[520:45.24]Have a great rest of your night.
[520:47.18]Thank you for watching.
[520:48.20]I'm going to do stream legends if you would like to use it.
[520:52.03]If you'd like to play and you'd mess around before or after streams.
[520:56.43]I'm about to turn it on.
[521:02.77]I can't wait for the butt stream.
[521:05.67]Stay tuned for the colonoscopy stream.
[521:12.46]I cannot even open my extensions menu for some reason.
[521:16.76]Also, good news, another day of no real internet problems.
[521:21.68]This was just under 9 hours and I only have 1300 drop frames, which is pretty typical.
[521:26.76]That's very normal.
[521:32.52]Cross your fingers that we're through the woods on that one.
[521:37.38]It's been a few days now.
[521:40.79]Is Twitch having problems?
[521:42.09]I can't open my extension manager.
[521:43.99]Alright, it's open now.
[521:48.60]Here we go.
[521:49.06]Ready?
[521:50.26]3, 2, 1.
[521:51.90]Open your presents.
[521:52.60]And there you go.
[521:59.94]Gifts are out.
[522:01.55]What's a colonoscopy?
[522:02.81]I'll answer that real quickly before I go.
[522:04.33]A colonoscopy is... You are... Put under sedation.
[522:11.34]And they do an endoscopy.
[522:13.62]They put a camera... In a place that sun don't shine.
[522:20.92]And they examine your entire... Intestinal tract.
[522:26.28]They scope your colon.
[522:27.74]Yes.
[522:30.62]The elbow.
[522:34.13]All of it.
[522:34.49]Yes, the whole thing.
[522:37.44]Do it without sedation.
[522:38.28]I actually didn't want to do it with sedation, but this practice that I'm going to, I asked them about it, and they do not do no sedation colonoscopies.
[522:49.70]The reason why I said I didn't want sedation is because I've done two sigmoidoscopies before without sedation.
[522:55.96]They don't really do them.
[522:57.94]And a colonoscopy is sort of just a sigmoidoscopy 2.0.
[523:00.53]It's just longer.
[523:05.29]So, I've done them before, and I just, I don't like, like, anesthetic drugs, they, they fuck with you.
[523:20.38]But!
[523:22.98]Uh, we'll see.
[523:23.76]I'm just, I'm doing it for a couple of reasons.
[523:25.50]There's a preventative reason why I want, you know, just want to make sure.
[523:29.28]I've never really had, like, a full-on, complete colonoscopy before.
[523:33.52]It's good to do.
[523:34.50]Because, obviously, my condition that I've had over the last decade.
[523:39.17]So, a new place.
[523:41.63]I want to get re-evaluated.
[523:42.67]I've had some issues the last year.
[523:47.63]So, I'm just going to go in, you know, do what you got to do.
[523:52.78]And I should be fine.
[523:53.70]Don't worry about me.
[523:56.50]I have the best colon.
[523:57.32]It's the largest colon.
[523:58.44]No one's colon is better than my colon.
[524:10.23]That's so stupid.
[524:13.49]Somebody wrote that I had.
[524:14.71]I just had to... Monka LUL.
[524:18.07]Does that exist?
[524:19.30]Should I like make that a thing?
[524:24.03]I made that up.
[524:24.81]Don't ever forget that.
[524:33.08]Alright, goodnight guys.
[524:33.90]I will see you tomorrow.
[524:35.84]Have a great rest of your night.
[524:38.18]Take care.
[524:58.80]Thank you.
