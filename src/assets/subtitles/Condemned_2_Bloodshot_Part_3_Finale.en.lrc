[00:58.73]Hi, guys.
[01:03.08]I'm late until I talk?
[01:05.78]That's not true.
[01:09.60]That's bullshit.
[01:13.13]Actually, we'll break this down in just a bit.
[01:16.11]We gotta wait for people to trickle in here.
[01:17.37]I wanna break this down.
[01:18.13]We're gonna talk about this, because...
[01:21.17]Um, the show, the show is late, the stream is late until I speak.
[01:26.99]Right, the show doesn't start or the stream doesn't start, whatever, however you want to classify a broadcast until I talk.
[01:34.45]Let's break that down.
[01:36.29]Join me soon when we break it down on Jerma985.
[02:43.75]It's got to get nice and toasty in here.
[02:45.17]This room gets really cold sometimes, especially in the winter months.
[02:56.65]When is winter officially?
[03:00.65]It's late fall.
[03:03.37]Fall is weird.
[03:04.71]Don't you guys feel like fall is a fake in-between season that only lasts like three weeks?
[03:18.92]december 21st I feel like fall is september I feel like it's just october october is fall and then like in the first week or two of november it's it's time to talk about it's time to talk about the winter it's too cold
[03:42.90]All the leaves fall off.
[03:44.38]Everyone thinks that's so cool.
[03:46.06]When the leaves turn color.
[03:48.30]Alright, so when the leaves turn color and then they fall, fall's done.
[03:51.44]That's what that means.
[03:52.76]The leaves fall down.
[03:54.70]And then it's over.
[03:56.05]Now you move on to winter.
[04:02.15]Alright, let me get my controller set up.
[04:26.98]I understand that, but... So you have winter.
[04:30.90]It means cold.
[04:32.62]That's the definition.
[04:33.56]Winter is the Latin word for cold.
[04:37.32]And then you have spring is an English word, obviously.
[04:41.95]Spring means, like, you spring up.
[04:44.13]The flowers spring up.
[04:47.11]Summer.
[04:48.73]Summer is also Latin for heatwave.
[04:52.03]Autumn...
[04:54.03]autumn does it somebody made up the word autumn what does that mean that's not latin for fall let's be okay I'm gonna be real I'm gonna be real though let's be real before I start streaming spring summer winter
[05:18.82]Autumn, fall.
[05:20.10]Why is it two names?
[05:21.80]Why isn't winter also called like winter, cold, summer, hot?
[05:26.35]We don't say like hot and we know what season it is.
[05:29.43]Why is it two names for autumn?
[05:31.33]Why don't we just call it autumn?
[05:35.62]Who's the fucking genius that thought of that?
[05:43.30]Next, I'm going to say Santa doesn't exist.
[05:44.76]He does.
[05:46.61]He does.
[05:46.95]Who do you think gives you your presents?
[05:48.91]What do you think you get your presents from on Christmas?
[05:54.91]Answer me that one.
[05:57.05]I'm waiting.
[06:01.52]Back to frame hell.
[06:04.20]Somewhat.
[06:04.78]Wait.
[06:05.14]Oh, fuck.
[06:05.48]I forgot what I was doing.
[06:06.72]Okay, I have to go around these guys, right?
[06:14.67]That was easy.
[06:18.27]How do you knock him out?
[06:18.89]I gotta, like, scramble this guy, right?
[06:23.69]Until I can... What kind of training does this guy have?
[06:31.91]I'm not supposed to kill the guards.
[06:34.27]Alright, so here we go.
[06:36.45]Grab enemy, and then slowly choke.
[06:44.36]Off to a great start.
[06:46.20]Now, how's everybody doing?
[06:47.02]First of all, I didn't get a chance to... I'm not getting right into the game.
[06:50.86]Let's just talk for a minute.
[06:52.38]That's what I usually do.
[06:53.17]We usually just hang out and chat.
[07:00.19]Hey, Stix, thanks for the $1.
[07:01.55]Wow, is this the streamer who spent more on Man vs. Wild than a PlayStation 3 controller?
[07:06.64]Yes, it is.
[07:09.74]It is the one and only.
[07:12.56]Uh, Atrolux, thank you Atrolux, or Atro, for the five dollars.
[07:17.38]And they say, shout out to my shark boyfriend.
[07:22.75]Well, hopefully they're watching.
[07:25.45]Although there are sharks, so they're probably underwater.
[07:27.91]And there is no Twitch.tv underwater.
[07:30.03]At least not from what I understand.
[07:34.69]That guy took way too long to get what he... He had a chance to absolutely get me off guard.
[07:41.51]Instead, he turned the corner and was raring to go.
[07:50.02]Like Chocobot.
[07:52.78]He was very indecisive about that.
[07:59.36]No, I don't want to... I gotta take a picture of this, don't I?
[08:03.39]Yeah.
[08:03.65]This is where we left off.
[08:05.37]Okay.
[08:11.31]Not at the museum, the game.
[08:12.55]Kind of.
[08:12.83]Why are they so moany?
[08:13.85]I don't know.
[08:15.25]Why are they so moany?
[08:16.37]This is the PlayStation 3.
[08:17.79]We already watched this cutscene, so we're going to skip it.
[08:22.49]Can I skip?
[08:23.11]No, I don't think I can.
[08:41.75]Well, shit!
[08:42.49]We got sent back this far?
[08:43.37]This was... I pretty much did this, and then we went off on, like, a fucking tangent.
[08:46.73]Thank you, Klosky, for the five dollars.
[08:48.19]Never get to catch your streams, but when I do, it's always a good time.
[08:50.59]Now, here's your bits, you dirty bitch screamer.
[08:52.46]Jesus!
[09:13.13]Hey, I never get to catch your streams, but when I do, you're a dirty piece of shit.
[09:17.82]My God.
[09:19.00]All right, here we go.
[09:20.02]Multiple choice question in this one.
[09:21.18]Thank you, Klosky.
[09:21.86]Appreciate it.
[09:22.26]Thank you so much.
[09:24.64]Dirty fit streamer.
[09:43.93]What are my thoughts on salted milk?
[09:45.65]You mean cheese?
[09:46.39]Uh, I... Cheese is pretty good.
[09:47.92]I like it.
[09:48.26]Good, you got it.
[09:48.86]Oh, yeah, butter.
[09:53.54]Salted milk is butter.
[09:54.30]Well, cheese.
[09:54.70]It's cheese.
[10:14.74]All right search museum for Q for cute clues there like this one photograph it zoom in But thank you yo best friend for that and storm GC thanks for the $5 well How often do you play games you play on stream off stream later I
[10:42.34]Well, in the case of these, in the case of like a PlayStation 3 game, not at all.
[10:49.60]These old games that I play, I solely want to play them for streams because they're realistically only can be played once or twice.
[11:01.06]Like Condemned and Condemned 2, these games are less than like eight hours long.
[11:04.86]So I don't have an opportunity to play them off stream.
[11:09.28]But something like Shadow of War, yeah, I'd play off stream.
[11:13.04]Although I haven't really played it that much.
[11:17.84]As much as I'd like to.
[11:22.21]What about the Saw?
[11:23.29]What about the Saw?
[11:24.43]Hey, was the new Saw any good?
[11:25.73]Did anybody see it?
[11:28.89]Didn't they make like an eighth Saw movie where it's supposed to be the first Saw movie?
[11:32.89]Right?
[11:34.11]Find the exhibit that tool came from.
[11:36.35]SKX was certainly there at one point.
[11:40.73]Alright, I gotta find the exhibit for the saw tool.
[11:44.87]Wherever that is.
[11:45.93]I'm gonna assume we're just walking this way.
[11:49.03]This is the logical next step in the museum.
[11:55.70]Although I could pull out the map.
[11:57.28]Does it say where?
[11:58.68]Look at the way he's holding this.
[12:03.72]No.
[12:09.89]No.
[12:12.03]Maybe I should follow the footprints.
[12:15.13]There's only one way to go.
[12:17.11]And it's over there.
[12:18.13]Alright, there he is.
[12:25.09]Okay, what about out here?
[12:28.11]Anything?
[12:28.49]Is this where the saw came from?
[12:30.93]Got it.
[12:33.83]By the way... Oh, we forgot!
[12:35.37]We forgot!
[12:36.23]We gotta talk about this.
[12:37.31]Somebody brought up...
[12:39.33]I don't know why picking up a saw made me think about this, but... So somebody said, hey, Jerma, you know, you're late until you start talking.
[12:49.17]You start the stream at 7 o'clock, but until I hear your voice, the stream has not started.
[12:54.44]I would like to show you behind curtain number one any TV show you've ever watched.
[13:00.08]Any live TV show you've ever watched.
[13:02.18]They do the intro song.
[13:03.74]There's an intro.
[13:05.20]They usually last like 30 seconds to a minute.
[13:07.53]Sometimes it even cuts right to a commercial after the intro.
[13:10.41]And you don't get to watch your show for like six or seven straight minutes.
[13:13.95]Live TV.
[13:15.17]Live sporting event.
[13:17.18]They warm up.
[13:18.18]There's practice.
[13:25.48]I have an intro song, and I have an intro.
[13:27.62]It shows the credits of who made everything.
[13:30.88]Yeah, it's just me.
[13:32.94]But sometimes the credits take a long time.
[13:36.27]Alright, this is teaching me how to walk slow.
[13:43.09]This is just back out here.
[13:44.05]I need to go this way.
[13:47.88]Where's this person that's in here?
[13:53.55]I'm going to find where the exhibit, where this came from.
[13:58.94]Paleontology lab.
[14:01.10]Small specimen storage.
[14:02.36]This is the only place we have not gone.
[14:11.01]Also, another thing to note.
[14:14.17]Can you believe, those of you guys that, how long ago were you guys in middle school?
[14:21.82]Because when I was in middle school, we used to cut paper with this shit.
[14:27.14]There was a 16-inch blade inside of a classroom that the kids were supposed to use.
[14:38.25]That's crazy, now that I think about this now.
[14:40.05]I remember when I was like fucking 12 or like 13, going up to the giant guillotine and going like and slicing through paper.
[14:53.64]That is kind of outrageous.
[14:55.58]That we were allowed to do that.
[14:59.62]Do they still have them?
[15:01.40]Paleontology Lab B. I have to probably start opening draws.
[15:08.08]They really made the detective shit in this game.
[15:09.82]Like a 4 out of 10.
[15:12.60]The last one was cheesy and campy and you got the Ghostbusters tools.
[15:16.56]This one is... I don't like this one.
[15:19.26]I don't like this one's detective shit.
[15:26.11]What if the door had not gone in?
[15:29.11]Condemned to is kind of just like run around in a circle until you open the one door you didn't open yet.
[15:35.96]I mean, there's this.
[15:37.72]Which, who knows what the hell this thing is.
[15:41.80]Is this where it was supposed to be?
[15:42.88]I don't know.
[15:48.57]Exit to public galleries.
[15:52.88]I have to track the weapon with the UV ray.
[15:56.23]But the UV thing, it leaves, like, fucking blood.
[16:01.19]Well, I guess we're gonna do this.
[16:05.47]Yeah, the guy, like, scraped the ground every eight inches to make sure he could remember where he left it.
[16:09.70]Okay, well, they stop here.
[16:19.94]What if those are my footprints?
[16:21.63]So I guess we have to go from here.
[16:25.21]Because I don't think it's in any of those.
[16:28.01]Here we go.
[16:28.79]Find the fucking Easter egg basket again, kids.
[16:44.63]What?
[16:51.72]I was literally just over there.
[16:53.82]Where the hell is it then?
[17:03.01]There's nothing in this.
[17:07.45]What, do I have to look at the samurai picture?
[17:13.99]I don't understand.
[17:15.73]The guy got really, really into looking at these photos and then died right here.
[17:20.15]And then somebody scooped him up.
[17:21.15]Because he doesn't exist anymore.
[17:29.78]And he like walked around in a circle.
[17:34.58]And then like opened to this.
[17:50.30]Alright, keep going.
[17:51.66]We found the door.
[17:53.77]That's where it went.
[17:56.05]Oh, come on, you fucking asshole.
[17:57.43]Really?
[18:02.55]So I can't go in this door.
[18:08.66]That makes things a little more complicated now, doesn't it?
[18:16.60]The one door that I'm not allowed to go in.
[18:26.63]God dear investigating.
[18:28.03]Yeah, it's a walk and find the footprints on the ground.
[18:34.72]Just walk around in a fucking circle.
[18:36.86]He went like this way and this way.
[18:39.34]And then he stopped and turned around.
[18:51.21]I mean, all I have is the spectrometer is audio.
[18:53.95]The camera is pictures.
[18:54.77]The GPS is just a GPS.
[19:08.77]Is there nothing?
[19:09.17]Can I get like around that somehow?
[19:17.57]So, I have to go, like, over there.
[19:19.61]There's no guy to get... That's where the guy gave me ten fingers.
[19:23.65]So, it led to the saw blade.
[19:25.11]And then it said, go find where the saw blade is!
[19:27.92]Okay.
[19:29.62]Well... Can't I just fight guys with a fucking wrench?
[19:34.16]Like, I don't understand why games do this.
[19:41.10]This leads to the fucking sword.
[19:44.12]And then I take a picture of the sword.
[19:51.84]Hey, find where that came from.
[19:52.92]Okay.
[19:53.14]Like, do I have to go up here?
[19:57.81]Oh my fucking god.
[20:04.17]Identify the camera.
[20:07.41]I don't know.
[20:07.81]It's a fucking Kodak.
[20:09.48]Jesus Christ.
[20:13.01]Camera 1503 was installed a week ago and just completed its 48 hour stress test.
[20:18.05]Ethan, if you think SKX may be on camera, find the surveillance room and let's take a look.
[20:29.88]Okay.
[20:33.98]I had to climb like over the wall into the ceiling.
[20:42.88]Oh, now I dropped... Oh, what the hell was that?
[20:48.51]Someone just dropped a bloody school cutting knife down here.
[20:52.61]It's alright.
[20:53.13]I really almost got to see a chiropractor.
[20:56.83]Let me take care of that for you.
[21:00.97]Well, now it's just construction.
[21:05.00]I'll get him.
[21:15.53]You know, he is doing the thing that I would have done.
[21:18.29]If I got hit in the face with a brick out of nowhere, I can guarantee you I'm running out of this place.
[21:24.91]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[21:25.69]I don't know where I'm gonna go, but I'm gonna run.
[21:28.92]As fast as I can.
[21:30.48]And I'm gonna call the police.
[21:33.48]I don't think I can go down there.
[21:43.84]What?
[21:45.14]Shit.
[21:48.17]I love how this just turned into the Tower of Terror.
[21:49.99]You know the new Tower of Terror?
[21:51.97]Well, we got this guy here, too.
[21:57.17]Fuck.
[22:00.31]God damn it, I missed him.
[22:03.83]At least I'm... I scared him, at least.
[22:08.77]As long as they get scared and get out of the way, so I don't have to fight them, then I'm happy.
[22:18.45]My guard's going to come find me?
[22:20.35]No, he definitely is not.
[22:22.29]I don't think the AI is that well programmed.
[22:25.55]Good evening.
[22:26.99]This is Sarah Brenton, City News.
[22:29.86]With her head reportedly missing, Mayor Rachel Mars is dead.
[22:34.08]Her decapitated body was found earlier today at the Museum of Natural History.
[22:39.00]Apparently, she was murdered suffering extensive cutting about her body.
[22:43.49]There are no leads as of yet.
[22:44.69]This lady works a lot.
[22:50.43]What's that?
[22:53.02]More after this.
[22:53.62]Okay.
[22:54.26]Whatever.
[22:57.06]Pick up the baton.
[22:57.88]Oh, god damn it.
[22:58.88]I lost the brick.
[23:09.93]That was covered in blood.
[23:11.23]Did he fight the other security guard?
[23:13.41]Why is he covered in blood?
[23:16.38]Why is there blood all over this guy's back?
[23:20.31]Did I just do that to him?
[23:21.47]I don't know.
[23:21.95]I don't think so.
[23:23.87]He was hiding.
[23:25.09]Right here.
[23:27.43]I didn't open this door.
[23:30.33]Well, we killed somebody, so too late.
[23:32.94]Oh, well.
[23:35.94]Oh, the brick!
[23:36.56]That's the guy I hit in the face with the brick.
[23:42.90]I forgot.
[23:43.54]That's right.
[23:44.00]I did brick that guy.
[23:53.41]Get out, man.
[23:54.25]What are you thinking?
[23:56.63]Alright, what are we looking for?
[24:01.52]This is the security office.
[24:04.64]This is the security office!
[24:06.38]I didn't even say the S. Find the right backup drive.
[24:17.17]I don't even know what a backup drive looks like.
[24:19.47]Is it in here?
[24:21.89]Backup drive A, D, E, B, C. I have no idea.
[24:27.70]Did I figure that out yet?
[24:30.18]I don't think I did.
[24:41.25]Okay, these are soda cans.
[24:42.31]Those are not hard drives.
[24:46.31]For some reason, I'm like, wait a minute.
[24:47.35]Oh, there they are.
[24:51.28]Hard drive?
[24:52.46]No, that's a DVD drive.
[24:56.24]Show us your face.
[24:57.36]Why?
[24:59.40]No, I'm like... I didn't take a shower today.
[25:01.57]Alright, here we go.
[25:03.01]Backup drive 1503, 1504.
[25:03.81]I have no clue.
[25:04.69]I think it's this one.
[25:05.87]It's not it.
[25:06.33]Okay.
[25:30.90]You know what I'm gonna do one day?
[25:32.80]One day... One day, I'm going to have this turned... Like, what's happening here is that's capturing the last frame that this has taken when it turns off.
[25:45.58]When I go like this, it's capping that last frame.
[25:50.06]So one day, I'm gonna tell you guys, I'm not prepared for it now, but I'm gonna cap... I'm gonna turn the camera on before the stream and cap me in a fucking costume.
[25:59.61]And then when I uncap it, it's going to go right back to where it's just me sitting in the seat.
[26:05.73]So, I'm going to be dressed in like a wolfman costume.
[26:08.15]I'm going to be like a dog.
[26:09.06]I'm going to be dressed as a dog.
[26:10.90]For like one frame.
[26:12.34]And then that's it.
[26:14.54]There you go, you got to see my face.
[26:16.64]I wouldn't even pay attention.
[26:17.56]What did she say?
[26:19.02]Locate the tool exhibit.
[26:20.10]I didn't even hear what she said.
[26:25.52]Men's locker room.
[26:31.52]Alright.
[26:34.76]Is it weird that I thought one of the lockers had a penis?
[26:39.01]Is that, like, odd for me to say?
[26:43.21]I honest to God thought that that locker in the middle had a penis.
[26:47.81]I thought the devs, like, threw in a fucked up Easter egg right here.
[26:55.27]Nope.
[27:00.24]Go, go, go.
[27:00.76]Unless there's something in here I can open.
[27:06.29]I can open this, it looks like.
[27:07.21]This one's like a jar.
[27:08.79]Why can I not take lockers in this one?
[27:14.27]Healing.
[27:15.15]Let's keep moving.
[27:20.52]This is... Ahead of museum security.
[27:25.48]Somebody killed him.
[27:26.72]It was me.
[27:29.10]Anything else to look at?
[27:30.38]Meeting room.
[27:36.04]What?
[27:36.98]Oh, you're doing a whole lot of work, guys.
[27:39.97]Yeah.
[27:41.55]Take a look.
[27:43.39]Take a look at the guys at work.
[27:47.67]Hmm.
[27:49.67]Seems like you're doing much more goofing off than you are getting shit done, huh?
[27:55.36]That's my handwriting.
[28:00.34]I'm not even kidding.
[28:07.84]I'm not fucking kidding, guys.
[28:08.98]I swear to God.
[28:09.50]That's my handwriting.
[28:11.39]I swear to God.
[28:13.87]This is fucking freaking me out.
[28:16.05]I'm not even kidding.
[28:18.35]I gotta write something down so you can see this.
[28:19.75]I'm not kidding.
[28:20.57]This is fucked up.
[28:30.87]Watch this.
[28:32.83]I swear to God.
[28:48.31]Was it Everybody Loves?
[29:03.96]The choco durian.
[29:21.35]Check this out.
[29:34.06]That's my handwriting.
[29:55.09]That's fucked up.
[30:05.10]I mean, I did that like really quickly, but this is as if I wrote this on the screen.
[30:16.83]Well, all right.
[30:17.57]Anyways, let me take a picture of this.
[30:18.67]I'm going to send this to my mother.
[30:20.39]I'm not even kidding.
[30:20.93]How many times am I going to say I'm not even kidding in a row?
[30:25.29]Fucking a hundred times?
[30:34.33]It's literally just bad handwriting two times.
[30:38.91]No, that's my handwriting.
[30:41.53]I fucking wrote that.
[30:48.06]Where did he come from?
[30:49.22]Why is he here?
[30:50.00]Oh shit.
[30:59.27]Okay, don't kill him.
[31:01.65]What?
[31:10.08]Whaaaat?
[31:12.32]Like I wasn't here before.
[31:22.27]We got lost.
[31:23.43]I got lost after doing that.
[31:24.83]Where's the board?
[31:25.41]Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[31:26.89]Where's the saw?
[31:28.85]It's missing from, it's gonna be missing from a pedestal.
[31:33.59]No.
[31:36.63]Yeah, we got the checkpoint.
[31:40.10]He was hiding in one of the bedrooms?
[31:42.62]Oh, bathroom.
[31:45.94]Maybe he was.
[31:46.44]I'm not sure.
[31:48.42]Was it maybe the sarcophagus?
[31:53.04]The fuck are they doing?
[31:56.63]We got some vandals.
[32:01.11]Fellas, this is not cow tipping.
[32:02.73]What the hell are you guys doing?
[32:07.42]You mean to tell me that the security guard right here... That's not a security guard.
[32:11.96]Okay, I thought he was a security guard.
[32:16.48]Can I push this over?
[32:17.96]You fucking asshole.
[32:26.11]I love when they do the riled up thing where they shake their arms around.
[32:29.37]That didn't work.
[32:37.40]Why?
[32:39.86]Why is that not working?
[32:41.03]Oh my god, why?
[32:47.42]Just fucking die, please.
[32:51.24]Good, I just blew up his head.
[32:53.06]I'm so sick of that.
[32:56.04]I hate QuickTime event bullshit, and it's like half the fucking game.
[33:00.80]Now I'm angry, this guy ain't getting away.
[33:07.38]Now we found a Mortal Kombat character, that's great.
[33:17.50]Security!
[33:19.00]Security, please!
[33:22.65]Security, do something!
[33:24.74]This man broke in here and was vandalizing the property.
[33:27.20]Trying to help.
[33:34.90]Holy shit.
[33:37.30]Nice job.
[33:51.55]Ow.
[33:58.66]That was so stupid.
[34:04.46]I just, like, threw that guy off the top rope.
[34:08.33]Anybody, anything else going on here?
[34:09.49]Okay, that's fine.
[34:11.75]Same lady working.
[34:12.59]Oh.
[34:13.97]He looked just right in the crown of his head.
[34:16.61]Okay.
[34:22.92]At the scene is Tony Rhodes.
[34:25.05]Tony, what do you make of this?
[34:26.83]Tony?
[34:27.33]Yes, Sarah.
[34:29.51]I'm now a block away from the museum and have seen the unthinkable.
[34:32.67]Even he pointed at me.
[34:34.03]He's like, yeah, that's right, you're next.
[34:36.89]And then he jumped and landed on his own neck.
[34:39.99]The museum has been targeted by these thieves, some literally wearing artifacts out on their persons.
[34:44.93]Excuse me, sir.
[34:46.11]Care to make a comment about the latest event?
[34:47.61]Crazy dancing!
[35:03.10]Let's go.
[35:05.40]That was some crazy shit.
[35:06.38]Guy running down the street with a sword and armor.
[35:13.76]One of these guys is gonna break out, but I can definitely get a sword now.
[35:18.62]Huh?
[35:20.03]There's a guy in here, right?
[35:23.31]I thought that thing moved around so strange.
[35:25.39]One of these guys is going to be in a suit.
[35:27.13]I already know it.
[35:31.23]But like, don't ask me how they got him in the glass, right?
[35:34.57]Video game logic doesn't need to explain that.
[35:37.71]How'd you get him in the glass?
[35:39.07]How'd you get in the glass?
[35:43.95]You had to be put in there.
[35:46.70]Just waiting for the right opportunity when it's gonna happen.
[35:49.01]Ooh.
[35:51.45]I want the action.
[36:03.35]I'm certain.
[36:03.91]You hear it?
[36:06.70]That's him breaking the glass.
[36:07.84]He's like crinkling.
[36:08.62]No, that's a grout.
[36:09.34]Never mind.
[36:09.72]Forget it.
[36:15.94]They've taken over.
[36:19.90]How would I... How would you even have known where I was?
[36:30.79]Parry counter?
[36:31.59]Wait, what?
[36:32.71]That didn't even affect him.
[36:34.57]Fucking quick time.
[36:41.45]There's only one thing you should ever know about QuickTime.
[36:43.59]There's only one- There's only one QuickTime that anyone has ever cared about.
[36:48.51]And it's the- It's the stupid thing that no one ever use- You know what?
[36:51.61]I'm not gonna even make the joke because I'm sick and fucking tired.
[36:53.89]A QUICKTIME EVENT!
[36:56.29]I'm mashing L1, by the way.
[36:57.57]I don't know why that's not working.
[37:04.60]I was gonna make a fucking QuickTime the media player joke, but I could- There's no- It wasn't gonna happen.
[37:13.58]Adding quick time events to a game is just seriously telling your audience... We don't give a shit.
[37:21.92]Found my new, uh, favorite weapon, though.
[37:26.86]There are, like, bugs on the ground.
[37:30.06]It would have been alright.
[37:31.00]That would have been a pretty, like, decent joke, but I had to pay attention.
[37:33.32]I would have talked about, like, real player.
[37:36.02]Remember real player?
[37:38.57]I do.
[37:50.85]Okay.
[37:53.14]I'm gonna catch this guy in the act.
[37:54.30]I'm gonna catch this guy in the fucking act.
[38:04.94]Doing something bad.
[38:05.82]Aye, aye, aye.
[38:14.42]I missed.
[38:15.60]Can I get the spray paint?
[38:16.32]Please tell me I can get spray paint.
[38:21.91]Where are you going?
[38:23.79]Shit.
[38:28.29]You just run away?
[38:28.97]You don't do anything else but run away?
[38:30.29]Oh, what the fuck?
[38:42.03]Let's just move on with the program here.
[38:45.64]Good throw.
[38:48.90]Wasn't trying to go for a good throw.
[38:51.81]I was trying to go for a distraction.
[38:59.05]And... A couple of people.
[39:06.41]I guess I have to go down here.
[39:08.99]We're just going down.
[39:12.97]I'm going to go inside the center of the museum.
[39:16.63]With our war hammer.
[39:25.40]I had a grenade in his hand.
[39:31.98]Got him.
[39:33.92]I need health bad.
[39:37.79]Oh, shit.
[39:40.35]I'm not supposed to kill this guy.
[39:46.35]Too late.
[39:47.33]Where's the Warhammer?
[39:49.91]I just dropped it.
[39:50.41]I threw it at his face.
[39:54.38]There's no health ATM!
[39:57.08]Why is that guy on fire?
[40:05.08]What caused this guy to be on fire?
[40:09.20]I don't understand what's going on.
[40:17.14]What?!
[40:17.62]That's not how fucking they- That's not how a spray can works!
[40:25.60]You don't shake up hairspray and a flamethrower comes out.
[40:34.55]Was she holding a lighter?
[40:36.47]She just sprayed me with a flamethrower can.
[40:43.64]God damn it.
[40:44.50]Oh well.
[40:44.76]It's okay.
[40:46.00]Okay.
[40:52.25]I'm just gonna go... No, that's when I was chasing her.
[40:55.36]That's this way.
[40:57.14]That is literally how it works.
[40:58.58]Well, if she... I didn't... Did anybody see her hold up the other hand with a lighter or something?
[41:02.92]I saw her shake at her hip and then hold it up and spray it.
[41:14.95]Let's go.
[41:15.37]Okay.
[41:23.84]Break his face.
[41:26.18]Yes, I'm in the building.
[41:30.56]That guy was so easy.
[41:32.77]No, no.
[41:33.47]Do not let this lady do anything.
[41:38.83]Now, can I get her item?
[41:41.11]I don't think I can.
[41:42.11]Oh, well.
[41:42.59]That would be pretty cool if I could.
[41:57.54]I gotta get out of this big open area, because I have 8 frames a second.
[42:04.06]This frame damage is really... This fucking frame damage.
[42:08.35]Oh, give me a broadsword.
[42:16.19]Oh, you tried.
[42:17.27]You tried to be a hero.
[42:18.51]It just didn't work.
[42:21.01]Next time a guy has a battle axe and you have the upper hand, don't go up and punch him in the back.
[42:27.49]Shoot him.
[42:28.77]Or throw something at him.
[42:30.24]Or get an axe.
[42:31.72]You're surrounded by weapons.
[42:36.26]Everywhere around you is a weapon.
[42:41.48]If you just chose not to for some reason.
[42:53.74]I blocked that.
[42:55.28]Get out of town.
[43:06.47]He did have a sword.
[43:08.07]He chose not to use it.
[43:16.45]Okay, Batman.
[43:17.59]Okay, Superman.
[43:18.51]No, I have to do it right for justice.
[43:21.44]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[43:22.36]And look what happened to you.
[43:32.08]Didn't even have a baton.
[43:34.09]They're both coming for me now.
[43:37.73]He dropped the baton!
[43:46.49]He broke it, shit.
[43:47.21]Oh, what am I gonna do?
[43:48.38]Oh my god, he broke it.
[43:49.12]I don't know what to do.
[43:51.16]Shit, I don't have a weapon.
[43:52.44]Oh, no, it's okay.
[43:53.16]I'm surrounded by them.
[43:56.52]He's trying to do the same thing to me.
[44:00.50]Am I really this low on health?
[44:06.32]Give me another weapon.
[44:06.90]Come on.
[44:08.48]Come on, give me a helmet.
[44:09.48]Oh, boy.
[44:16.52]Where is he?
[44:19.94]I thought I had his head in my hand.
[44:27.18]I seriously thought I had his head in my hand.
[44:43.74]You guys can see how bad this is, right?
[44:47.62]Do I get like 8% credit?
[44:49.32]Do I get any slack at all for this?
[44:53.13]That's how I have to play this game.
[44:55.87]Can I have like 1% slack?
[44:58.67]Even like 1%.
[44:59.81]I'll take 1%.
[45:00.25]Why are there so many bricks?
[45:12.50]Might as well do this just because I know... Not here?
[45:17.70]No, over here.
[45:22.81]How's the new PC?
[45:23.69]Uh, it's working pretty well.
[45:31.66]It's working well enough.
[45:33.06]Doesn't need to be perfect.
[45:38.81]Doesn't need to be perfect.
[45:41.24]Forget bricks.
[45:42.46]Oh, it's giving me bricks as the thing is up on a roof somewhere.
[45:45.64]Wherever it is.
[45:46.20]It's right there.
[45:52.05]It's that easy, boys and girls.
[45:58.71]Onward and upward.
[46:08.55]I'm so paranoid about this.
[46:10.01]Now I have a longsword, this is good.
[46:20.89]Well, a new detective, multiple choice questions.
[46:32.62]Perfect!
[46:39.48]I don't want to touch this.
[46:40.90]You don't want to touch this shit?
[46:43.81]Collect a sample.
[46:44.61]Okay.
[46:45.89]Why would I do that?
[46:47.73]Taste it and see what it is.
[46:50.47]What is my blood type?
[46:54.13]Anybody know?
[46:54.65]Why would you guys know that?
[46:55.76]I don't even know my... What's my blood type?
[47:10.26]I don't know what it is.
[47:13.94]Where do I find that information?
[47:18.30]Hey, yo, best friend, for the one dollar, when you were talking about salted milk, no, I mean taking a glass of milk and adding salt.
[47:29.39]Pounds and pounds of salt.
[47:31.48]That sounds... That sounds terrible.
[47:35.55]But thank you.
[47:37.47]No, I wouldn't do it.
[47:38.13]Anybody have any evidence?
[47:40.05]Surrend the Crimson Fist.
[47:44.91]Thank you for the $5.
[47:48.81]Hardly ever catch your streams, but they're always pure gold.
[47:52.69]Cheers for all the laughs.
[47:54.07]Thank you.
[47:54.39]I hope you're enjoying yourself.
[47:57.59]If you're not, then fuck.
[48:01.44]I had one second to do that.
[48:03.34]I think I've got the buzzer.
[48:04.76]Thank you, Crimson Fist.
[48:05.61]Appreciate it.
[48:05.97]Bob Jackson, thanks for the $1.
[48:07.61]And Wild Omelette, thanks for the $1, too.
[48:17.29]Hey, Jerma, I'm super sick right now and your streams really churn me up, even though it hurts to laugh.
[48:21.53]Also, the hypercam joke last night was the best thing I've ever seen.
[48:25.39]I added that.
[48:28.23]I added that.
[48:29.67]That was the best thing I've seen in a long time.
[48:31.36]Not ever.
[48:33.38]Wow, really like trying to pat myself on the back there.
[48:36.68]Best thing ever.
[48:39.98]Really added that.
[48:43.20]But thank you, though.
[48:43.92]Thank you, Wild Omelette.
[48:47.29]Alright, now reach the main lobby.
[48:51.07]Which should be easy enough.
[48:52.43]Just to run back.
[48:56.41]Out of the way.
[49:01.21]I want to say, I'm probably one of those weird blood types.
[49:04.70]What's the weird one?
[49:05.40]What?
[49:11.50]Where?
[49:12.30]And where did he come from?
[49:15.17]Where did the guy... You played some weird music and a guy spawned behind me.
[49:25.97]Alright.
[49:28.57]Did he come out of the water?
[49:29.65]He might have come out of the lake.
[49:32.65]O is universal.
[49:33.43]I don't think I'm O. Thank god I started here.
[49:44.38]I think I'm like A. I think I'm A+.
[49:46.64]Yep, he did come out of the water.
[49:51.62]Son of a bitch!
[50:05.56]They can't come in the door?
[50:06.40]Alright, hold on a minute.
[50:08.11]Is this... Do I have a chance here?
[50:10.01]I think I might... I think I'm safe.
[50:11.35]No, I'm not safe.
[50:12.09]Damn it.
[50:12.63]I want to get a picture of the guy behind him.
[50:14.27]He can't believe what he's seeing.
[50:15.67]He's so fucked up on drugs.
[50:17.53]Oh, god damn it.
[50:18.57]That isn't perfect.
[50:24.59]I thought the suit of armor was moving.
[50:27.05]I was like, don't tell me that now is the time it happens.
[50:42.69]Anyways.
[50:44.57]I think I am... I think I'm an A+.
[50:52.40]Definitely not A-.
[50:53.26]I am absolutely A+.
[50:56.50]I'm definitely a positive.
[51:09.56]Who was chasing who?
[51:17.10]The guy that you were pursuing was behind you.
[51:21.28]I guess you didn't know that.
[51:25.25]In a world where the police are stupider than the psychotic drug addict freak shows.
[51:43.46]Just get out of the way.
[51:44.36]They get like right up in your fucking face.
[51:46.02]It's just a disaster every time you fight a guy.
[52:02.95]It doesn't have to be.
[52:06.33]Doesn't have to be a disaster every single fight.
[52:09.99]Photograph the artifact on the statue.
[52:16.10]that thing did I get it do you ever get guns in this game you know it's really interesting that you say that because this is this is just about what five or six hours into the game
[52:40.15]And there has been almost no guns.
[52:42.94]Oh, here's the boss.
[52:46.02]I have to play chivalry.
[52:48.82]Alright, I have to actually play chivalry.
[52:53.38]Good thing he still brings.
[52:59.92]That can't be parried, so that has to be done very...
[53:05.49]I don't think I heard him.
[53:06.37]I have to lure this guy somewhere.
[53:24.03]I guess that could kind of be buried.
[53:29.03]I need to get a combo to see if it works.
[53:32.96]I got it, but... No, you're in armor.
[53:35.94]I can't hurt you.
[53:52.53]I just freaked out.
[53:55.47]Get out of the way.
[53:56.55]There's a guy with an axe chasing me.
[54:04.60]I should be paying it!
[54:07.32]I knew I had to deal with that.
[54:08.78]He's not dead.
[54:11.18]Can I do anything else about this?
[54:18.96]Whoa!
[54:22.33]Do you hear him?
[54:23.57]Do you hear him?
[54:24.55]I can still hear him.
[54:27.82]Just go.
[54:36.74]I don't want to get killed by that guy.
[54:38.70]Is he here?
[54:42.52]Is he here?
[54:43.04]I am so paranoid right now about that guy running at me.
[54:48.36]Please, I'm gonna use a crossbow.
[54:50.22]Absolutely.
[54:51.74]Finally, we just talked about how there are no guns in the game.
[55:02.17]Oh, got him.
[55:02.77]Got him.
[55:03.65]Oh.
[55:05.09]Oh.
[55:17.55]Direct hit.
[55:18.92]I'll take it.
[55:26.58]Oh, no.
[55:27.90]He's back again.
[55:28.68]Did anybody feel like that was a long way down for how far I actually fell?
[55:37.17]Alright, I have to drop something on him or something.
[55:39.77]I gotta drop something on his head.
[55:42.05]This is not gonna do anything.
[55:42.89]I'm not gonna waste bullets.
[55:45.21]What if I had to get in his suit of armor, too?
[55:50.96]Maybe I can hit him with this.
[55:55.19]No, not really.
[55:57.85]Did I take the helmet off?
[56:04.59]No.
[56:10.85]Give it to me!
[56:13.87]Where's the thing I can knock down?
[56:15.05]Definitely don't have to go that way.
[56:19.07]What is this?
[56:21.35]Come on.
[56:21.67]Where's the giant brick that I have to drop on his head?
[56:29.75]Gun.
[56:31.45]Armor does not... They did a Mythbusters on this.
[56:35.24]Armor does not work against a machine gun.
[56:37.06]So I have to get the machine gun that's in that crate.
[56:49.55]See?
[56:51.67]Wow!
[56:52.29]Wow.
[56:52.59]What about electricity?
[56:54.93]Nothing else in there?
[56:58.41]Maybe I do have to just fight him.
[57:12.10]I don't think I can go anywhere.
[57:16.52]Electricity?
[57:17.17]Come on, he's... The guy is a total conductable electric person.
[57:21.56]He's wearing metal.
[57:22.52]You're telling me I can't electrocute the shit out of him?
[57:25.35]I think I'll take a sip.
[57:42.41]I don't know what I have to do here.
[57:43.47]Maybe bring him back up.
[57:48.49]No, I don't have to bring him back up, do I?
[57:50.18]No.
[57:53.18]Lost my crossbow.
[58:03.13]Well, there are crossbows everywhere.
[58:05.65]Maybe I'm just overthinking this.
[58:07.91]What do you think?
[58:15.08]It's making a gunshot ricochet.
[58:22.67]You're talking about like in there.
[58:30.91]Hasn't he walked over this like three times?
[58:38.10]He's walked over that three times.
[58:48.13]Stomp it.
[58:49.53]I have to get him to do that.
[58:51.10]Okay, he'll do that in here.
[58:55.00]No, you're going the wrong way, man.
[58:55.98]Do that over here.
[58:56.86]Come on, swing down.
[59:03.65]Crush it down.
[59:08.21]Swing down at me.
[59:11.05]Oh, motherfucker.
[59:11.91]Do that again.
[59:13.69]Do that again, but, like, right here.
[59:20.19]That's very clearly what I have to do.
[59:28.97]Can I break it with my own sword or something?
[59:32.50]I'm gonna die.
[59:39.10]That's not how you do it.
[59:39.98]I gotta do this some other way.
[59:41.24]I gotta break this some other way.
[59:43.70]Because he's directly stood on top of this and did it.
[59:46.73]So that's not what I got to do.
[59:51.85]Come on, snap, man.
[59:58.79]We both have to be standing on it?
[60:07.72]I'm definitely overthinking this.
[60:13.74]Are you serious?
[60:20.10]Okay, so you know when you used to buy an action figure, and they had a button on their back?
[60:30.40]You could put armor, you could put a bunch of cool stuff, like a suit on them.
[60:35.17]There was a button on those action figures' backs that when you pressed it, it took all the clothes, all the armor, all the cool shit off.
[60:42.81]It would just fall off.
[60:44.41]I pressed the little button on the side of that guy's costume.
[60:49.78]That's literally the only thing that happened.
[60:51.72]Is that it?
[61:07.94]They're going to choose how?
[61:10.93]That's how.
[61:11.29]That's how I would have done it.
[61:14.53]Made up toy.
[61:15.29]No.
[61:16.13]There was a toy.
[61:17.15]I'm going to look it up.
[61:33.77]You're looking more beat up every time I see you.
[61:36.60]I think you overstayed my welcome.
[61:39.72]I found something when investigating Van Horn's body.
[61:41.86]Here, here's one right here.
[61:42.82]No, no, no, something better.
[61:44.85]I found traces of fecal matter on his shoes.
[61:46.71]This is Big Hero 6.
[61:48.51]Let me finish.
[61:49.47]It belongs to an endangered... Big Hero 6 removable armor toy.
[61:54.79]You mean the wildlife preserve up north?
[61:57.49]Yeah, I figure the best way to track SKX is to... It all comes off like nothing.
[62:01.90]...back.
[62:02.90]Iron Man.
[62:03.50]There's an Iron Man that you press the button and all the fucking Iron Man suit comes off.
[62:07.04]And it's Dr. What's his name there?
[62:22.15]I can't remember his name.
[62:24.18]Uh... What's his name?
[62:24.98]What's his name?
[62:25.44]Tony... Tony Robbins.
[62:27.06]No, Tony Robbins is the motivational speaker.
[62:29.34]Tony... Tony Danza.
[62:31.12]What's the... What's his fucking name?
[62:33.83]Don't... I'm not gonna read chat because I refuse to not know this.
[62:35.83]I'm... Tony... Tony... Tony Stark.
[62:44.19]The target just boarded the plane.
[62:47.19]It's Ted Danza.
[62:49.44]It's Ted... Tony Danza is... Not Tony Danza.
[62:55.28]Not Tony Robbins.
[62:56.26]Tony Stark.
[62:59.10]That's the easiest... That is the easiest superhero question ever.
[63:03.10]And I could have got... Look, I haven't had my morning coffee and it's 8 o'clock in the morning.
[63:07.50]8 o'clock in the evening.
[63:10.74]I can drop a waypoint in my GPS now.
[63:18.04]Tony Danson.
[63:20.96]Dead Danson.
[63:22.58]Wow, I mean, wow.
[63:27.04]Lowry, I mean, come on.
[63:28.10]What are you talking about?
[63:30.16]We need to get out of here.
[63:31.42]Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
[63:33.84]I can't believe Tony.
[63:35.00]Dead Danson.
[63:35.92]Dead Danson's in my house.
[63:37.34]Are you kidding me?
[63:39.28]But you still think I'm connected somehow?
[63:41.84]Yes, I do.
[63:44.31]This seems kind of crazy, that's all.
[63:47.48]When you land, search the lodge thoroughly and learn as much as you can.
[63:51.76]It's been abandoned for decades, but I have a hunch both Van Horns were there recently.
[63:59.57]Come on, that's Larry David.
[64:00.77]How much time we got left?
[64:01.69]If you guys don't watch Kirby Enthusiasm, it's a great show.
[64:04.83]Hey, buddy, did you hear me?
[64:06.73]Hello, Ethan.
[64:08.25]Not that much time, so I'll get right to the point.
[64:11.52]Your old boss, Pharaoh, is trying to protect you.
[64:15.60]Have you taken a moment to contemplate the meaning of this?
[64:19.38]He's the one that hired you.
[64:21.48]He guided you through the ranks of this.
[64:23.28]This story is bad.
[64:24.20]He's kept a close watch on your career.
[64:26.02]The first one was at least somewhat interesting.
[64:27.52]This is just a nonsense story.
[64:31.26]He may have ulterior motives using you.
[64:35.70]Something to think about when choosing your friends.
[64:50.75]What, you didn't know how to fly a plane?
[64:55.27]Shocking.
[65:00.92]A cheesy princess, thanks for the three dollars.
[65:02.64]They said you're wonderful.
[65:05.14]You're wonderful, thank you.
[65:07.72]Vidiot, thank you Vidiot underscore for the fifteen dollars.
[65:10.92]They said A, have a money.
[65:15.78]Thanks Vidiot.
[65:17.26]Fifteen bucks.
[65:18.42]Fifteen hundred bits.
[65:21.36]Very kind of you.
[65:22.92]Ivory, thanks for the $1 damage.
[65:24.16]Remember, you're an archer.
[65:25.84]You gotta roll for initiate and then use lightning bolt.
[65:29.35]I don't know how your LARP group handles you sometimes.
[65:37.35]God.
[65:38.39]Have a money.
[65:41.54]Alright, so I can drop a waypoint in my GPS.
[65:48.00]That'll probably help a lot because I get turned around all the time.
[65:56.46]Do you really expect to find anything out here other than a cold death?
[66:02.03]See what I'm talking about, though?
[66:02.99]Like, this is fucking stupid.
[66:04.39]Alright, like, I'm gonna be real.
[66:07.79]The first game was... cheeky.
[66:10.85]It had a little bit of weird undertones to it.
[66:14.95]But it was fun to go around and fight the guys that are hiding behind corners and the different weapons and the story.
[66:21.16]Come on, we're like on a fucking mountain now.
[66:23.12]Like, we've just been... There's so many different areas they've used.
[66:32.63]Do I really want to walk around a snowy mountain?
[66:34.77]This is like Until Dawn.
[66:40.11]And there's gonna be a new mutant monster person thing in the ice.
[66:42.95]Is that happening?
[66:44.59]To me.
[66:44.86]This is the best section of the game, really.
[67:00.67]Well.
[67:02.17]Oh well.
[67:03.75]Can't grab that?
[67:07.07]Where do you stand about the enemy?
[67:10.36]Am I the enemy?
[67:11.56]Or are you the enemy?
[67:14.30]And there are dinosaurs on this island.
[67:19.48]It's gonna be a fucking dinosaur.
[67:23.30]And then I'm going to reverse everything I said about how dumb all the random areas are.
[67:27.80]The fucking T-Rex or Velociraptor is going to chase me around.
[67:31.18]Yep.
[67:38.29]Can't wait to fight the dinosaur.
[67:39.65]Evidence.
[67:46.67]Identify bloody chunk.
[67:53.58]That is... Hmm.
[67:56.26]What is that?
[67:58.75]That is a hand.
[67:59.65]That's an arm.
[68:01.33]That's an arm.
[68:02.83]It's a very bulky arm.
[68:05.07]Determine how fresh it is.
[68:18.50]That's not how you determine how fresh it is.
[68:20.70]Okay, if we find the body...
[68:23.48]Define the appropriate approximate time of kill.
[68:27.82]Leaving the evidence area.
[68:29.02]How would I know this?
[68:36.30]There's absolutely no way you would be able to know this.
[68:40.54]Determine the time of kill.
[68:43.76]I don't know.
[68:47.72]Watch.
[68:51.27]Uh...
[68:54.12]What April?
[68:54.84]February 23rd?
[68:57.04]It's February 24th.
[68:57.72]No, it's not.
[69:00.14]It's... I don't know how... That's an analog watch, guys.
[69:04.18]It's the 23rd.
[69:06.89]And... Oh, goddammit, military time.
[69:10.31]What is going on?
[69:12.85]February 23rd.
[69:13.39]And that is 12.03.
[69:15.15]That's 1,200 hours.
[69:19.86]No, it's not.
[69:21.15]That's not true.
[69:22.05]That is 0, 300.
[69:22.39]No, that's 0, 0, that's 0, 0, 3.
[69:24.57]That's 1, 2, might be this.
[69:25.43]No, that's 2 o'clock in the morning.
[69:30.11]It's this.
[69:30.55]Got it.
[69:31.71]Get a sample.
[69:53.22]That was good.
[69:53.58]12 is new in the military, yeah.
[69:56.20]Once you get past 1,200 hours... No, once you get past 1,400 hours is where I have trouble.
[70:00.58]Once you get past 1,600, 1,700, 1,800, 1,900 hours, I'm like, uh-huh.
[70:02.10]And then when you get to 2,300 hours, I know that that's 11 o'clock.
[70:23.44]2400 hours is zero, which is midnight.
[70:26.65]There's no 2400 hours.
[70:37.05]More loud noises.
[70:38.53]My flashlight's not on.
[70:39.63]Oh, look.
[70:41.99]I'm going to have to find the noise.
[70:43.01]Find the noise.
[70:49.39]Watch out.
[70:51.65]There's an animal down here.
[70:52.93]When am I going to turn into where the spectrometer tells me to go?
[71:08.46]And it's inside of a cave.
[71:10.56]And a mountain lion chases me around and bites my face.
[71:13.80]And I have to tap L1 and R1 to get him off.
[71:16.08]That's going to be exciting for me.
[71:27.48]I'm getting closer.
[71:33.21]Let's go across the children's slide.
[71:40.92]It's very clearly that's a bear.
[71:46.10]Every time the bear talks, lightning strikes.
[71:48.64]That's making it a little more funny.
[71:50.78]Arginine vasopressin is an amino acid that naturally occurs in mammals and is typically triggered by dehydration.
[72:02.20]Uh, dehydration with all this snow.
[72:03.72]Perfect.
[72:04.36]I thought hydrophobia was when you're scared of water.
[72:09.11]Is that wrong?
[72:10.15]Hydrophobia.
[72:12.61]Fear of water.
[72:32.51]It is.
[72:35.15]Well, I thought you said that was a symptom of rabies.
[72:37.07]So wait, being scared of water is what... When you get rabies, you become afraid of water?
[72:46.70]Is that real?
[72:51.09]Even in a human?
[72:54.01]Even in a human, that's like, that happens.
[72:56.17]That's weird.
[72:57.49]Wow.
[73:03.72]So you know if you have rabies.
[73:05.84]If I go to take a shower and I'm scared to go in the water, like in the shower, then I might have rabies.
[73:10.29]I'd have to get checked for it.
[73:11.53]It's a pretty good way to know.
[73:18.39]Determine who it is.
[73:21.72]It's you.
[73:24.34]It fucking screams and grabs the arm and then the title card plays.
[73:28.48]And that's the end of the trailer.
[73:32.80]What was I doing?
[73:35.65]Got an ID card on you.
[73:38.73]The holster is... Empty.
[73:45.66]What else we got?
[73:47.30]Boots?
[73:47.58]What kind of shoes do you have?
[73:49.12]These look pretty clean.
[74:01.09]Isn't every one of these correct?
[74:03.65]They're clean, they're medium-sized, and the shoes are tied.
[74:09.27]Which one of these is the most correct?
[74:13.21]I don't know.
[74:13.65]They're tied.
[74:18.86]And there's the wallet.
[74:25.96]D. Rook?
[74:28.14]I can't see that shit.
[74:31.36]D. Iant?
[74:34.17]Okay, I see Iant.
[74:35.73]I'm gonna say it's D-Iant.
[74:37.93]I don't know.
[74:39.25]I'm not able to make an ID with what you sent me.
[74:44.30]Everybody's shoes are tied.
[74:46.52]Hey, see if you can get me an ID on this guy.
[74:54.48]Well, I mean, their shoes are tied.
[74:57.95]That's pretty important information.
[75:00.17]And apparently they were drinking Windex.
[75:02.66]Anybody we know in the office, like, drinking fucking cleaner?
[75:05.26]Because that's who it is.
[75:16.93]Why did that move on its own?
[75:19.64]Why did that move on its own?
[75:20.74]That just shook around on its own.
[75:22.54]That's sausage party shit right there, man.
[75:24.26]This is Toy Story level of the deception.
[75:27.36]That thing fucked up, whatever it is.
[75:29.73]I've seen that movie.
[75:33.54]Make sure they don't fucking come back.
[75:38.85]When are they going to start singing a song?
[75:45.15]Something upstairs.
[75:45.91]God damn it.
[75:51.89]For the love of fucking Lord in heaven.
[76:06.20]Whatever it is.
[76:06.91]Is it above me or is it on the same level?
[76:09.83]I don't know There's a bear in here.
[76:16.59]That's it.
[76:16.85]There's a bear in here.
[76:18.62]There's a bear in this house You gotta be kidding me Okay, cool.
[76:25.76]Give me something to fight this with.
[76:27.70]There's a bear.
[76:28.74]Yeah, there is.
[76:29.93]That's fine.
[76:34.96]That was actually... What was that?
[76:49.98]Should I ID this guy?
[76:53.56]You don't need any more information, huh?
[76:56.40]Continue searching the service building.
[76:57.88]Yeah.
[76:58.34]And then get run over by the bear.
[76:59.78]That's gonna be, like, in the next room.
[77:03.05]God damn it.
[77:04.73]Here we go.
[77:10.90]Suspicious door, man.
[77:18.38]That guy's shoes weren't tied.
[77:22.76]Why?
[77:23.14]Let's watch out for rabies.
[77:41.41]Where is he?
[77:41.79]Where's this bear?
[77:45.29]He ate somebody.
[77:45.85]He just ate someone.
[77:46.45]That means... If the bear just ate, it's like an alligator, right?
[77:53.48]Or it's like a shark.
[77:54.06]They don't want to eat anymore.
[78:00.82]Where's their hiding spot?
[78:13.93]Well, here's the room that the bear comes in.
[78:16.84]The bear is fucking huge!
[78:22.02]Oh my god!
[78:25.15]We just got knocked out of the game!
[78:45.02]Wow.
[78:47.88]Okay.
[78:48.60]I know I got it right, but at the same time... Alright, we're gonna be like a tacky tourist.
[78:59.49]Oh, honey, what's that?
[79:01.25]Oh, it's a bear!
[79:02.03]I'm still taking a picture.
[79:11.47]I'm still taking a picture.
[79:14.94]Tacky tourist!
[79:19.00]I really hope it saves these.
[79:25.74]So I guess I have to turn around and run.
[79:28.52]Anybody like a bear repellent?
[79:31.66]Move!
[79:34.28]Alright, he's too stupid to do this.
[79:36.10]He's brainless.
[79:37.00]Perfect.
[79:49.18]What?
[80:00.60]That was scarier than his initial entrance.
[80:08.22]I had to taunt him.
[80:09.02]Alright, here he comes.
[80:12.06]We gotta go this way.
[80:12.94]Go, go, go.
[80:16.15]He's stuck and now he's not fucking around.
[80:17.83]Can I push things in the way?
[80:19.13]Can I drop things?
[80:19.93]Can I do anything?
[80:20.41]Can I drop something?
[80:21.65]He actually does chase you.
[80:22.96]He actually is chasing me.
[80:24.24]Through this?
[80:25.04]Through here?
[80:26.58]That doesn't work.
[80:27.56]Does he see me?
[80:28.14]Does he smell me?
[80:34.74]He's trying to get in this room.
[80:43.09]Oh god.
[80:53.54]up the stairs quick.
[80:59.19]I can't believe that just happened.
[81:03.89]Oh, is he smart enough to come up the stairs?
[81:07.70]He is.
[81:08.52]He's just destroying the whole house.
[81:14.08]Get in there quick.
[81:14.92]I don't like animals.
[81:18.73]Yes, I do.
[81:20.11]I fucking love animals.
[81:21.89]Move something?
[81:23.03]Desk?
[81:23.29]I think I have to claw my way out of here.
[81:27.90]No, I gotta move this.
[81:28.52]Move.
[81:30.00]That's that easy.
[81:45.02]Alright, buddy.
[81:45.44]Where are we going?
[81:49.89]This guy... I need to kill the bear with the gun.
[81:53.85]Wait, I have one shot?
[81:56.77]Oh, dear.
[81:58.41]Oh, wait a minute.
[82:07.84]Did I get it?
[82:11.80]I got him.
[82:16.66]I didn't get him, I don't think.
[82:20.34]I don't think I got him.
[82:29.33]Am I being pulled back in his cave?
[82:31.59]I wanna do something.
[82:39.61]No, I think I did it.
[82:45.67]I got him.
[82:47.71]I win.
[82:49.81]I kind of want to... I want to go back and I want to get out of the way and have him kill that guy.
[83:00.52]Yeah.
[83:01.74]When he's helping me, I'm going to run forward.
[83:10.40]I'm going to move out of the way.
[83:19.12]Hey, take this, asshole.
[83:22.72]Ready?
[83:23.14]I'm going to take the shotgun.
[83:26.66]I'm going to hide over there.
[83:28.26]Is there a place where I can hide?
[83:29.32]Okay, here we go.
[83:32.35]Ready?
[83:32.55]Oh, I can't move.
[83:34.49]No.
[83:34.89]Oh, god damn it.
[83:35.81]What happens if you do it right?
[83:50.85]Doesn't matter.
[83:51.73]It's the same outcome every time.
[83:52.99]I couldn't turn around and shoot the guy either.
[84:05.83]I did do it right.
[84:06.85]I just had to shoot him.
[84:08.39]It's a scripted event.
[84:09.49]It's alright.
[84:11.03]That was still tragic.
[84:15.93]Note to the developers.
[84:18.91]That was the coolest thing in this whole game.
[84:21.87]You should have just made a bear escape video game.
[84:27.41]How much more awesome would this game have been?
[84:29.45]How much astronomically better would this game have been?
[84:34.08]If the whole game was you run from a fucking bear.
[84:37.24]Why has nobody done that?
[84:40.80]Eliminate him.
[84:41.62]He can't be allowed to interfere with our plan.
[84:44.81]That was really cool.
[84:51.75]Imagine that, being stuck in the woods with a log cabin house.
[84:55.51]And there's a giant bear that you have to not die from.
[85:02.25]Somebody trademark that right now.
[85:05.61]And trademark me.
[85:08.84]Add me to the list of the trademarkees.
[85:15.88]Is this a bad guy?
[85:21.44]I don't know.
[85:25.20]The other guy was a good guy.
[85:26.73]He didn't try to fight me.
[85:29.87]Okay, he's a bad guy.
[85:33.01]What do I do with this dude?
[85:45.29]trying to find out like something to do with it thanks for the gun I hope the bear comes back rosa I found the door to the library but it seems to be possibly an explosive nothing is ever easy is it god can you give me more information
[86:11.74]Yes, I can.
[86:13.51]There's three red wires.
[86:16.65]And it leads to this device.
[86:22.01]And this device.
[86:24.64]It's 21M2.
[86:24.98]So that's DETM12.
[86:26.26]That's a DEM12X.
[86:27.08]DETM12X.
[86:27.62]Wow.
[86:28.28]DETM12X.
[86:29.78]Class A.
[86:39.53]Yeah, hey, the DETM-12X's shoes are tight.
[86:42.46]If you were curious.
[86:43.14]Shoes are not tight.
[86:45.06]Oh, so don't... What about shooting the detonator?
[86:47.80]Don't breathe on it.
[86:49.40]Yeah, be careful.
[86:49.90]You've got to be so careful with that.
[87:14.34]Ethan, are you shooting the detonator?
[87:18.30]Yeah.
[87:20.32]Oh, God damn it.
[87:23.26]They did this in the last game.
[87:24.42]They already did this.
[87:25.71]You did this in the last game.
[87:26.89]This is just an... They did this exact, exact thing in the last game.
[87:32.99]In the same time period in the last game, too.
[87:49.67]He's not dead.
[87:55.94]Hey, remember when they did this in the last game and we determined it was the dumbest thing in the whole game?
[88:08.72]So it's been like six and a half hours in game time.
[88:10.94]Six and a half hours in game time.
[88:14.34]Follow the string.
[88:15.30]Let's do this one first.
[88:17.18]No, that one goes upstairs.
[88:18.18]We want this ground level first.
[88:22.16]So let's do... Which one are we going to do?
[88:24.70]All four of these go in here.
[88:28.21]We'll take the one on the right.
[88:39.89]And where's this picnic basket?
[88:42.97]It's in here somewhere.
[88:45.49]Cross the way.
[88:46.21]Under the chair.
[88:49.69]Throw it out a window.
[88:50.99]The whole house comes down.
[89:19.73]It's really like a grenade.
[89:22.52]That's a powerful grenade.
[89:29.70]That's a lot of damage from that grenade.
[89:32.09]Imagine getting one of those.
[89:37.07]Imagine getting one of those in a multiplayer game and throwing that in a building in Battlefield.
[89:43.02]Just get rid of like 400 people.
[89:46.81]Throw it out a window, like over there.
[89:48.51]Okay, throw it out the window.
[89:51.78]Got it.
[89:52.36]Is that far enough away?
[89:53.78]It's right next to the house.
[90:11.81]All right, we gotta go it's gonna go but this is like an atomic bomb Even if I throw this far away, it's gonna explode the whole fucking neighborhood What?
[90:23.12]Yeah, I get it Throw it out a window out the window hot potato What what uh, okay, we're good We're okay
[90:42.77]Why did that happen?
[90:43.89]I think the game just got sick of my shit.
[90:51.25]I can't fucking believe it.
[90:56.32]What the fuck?
[90:56.96]Why are you here?
[90:57.70]Don't you know there are explosives everywhere?
[91:00.12]My fucking stomach, man.
[91:11.06]Okay, I just threw this on the ground to unload.
[91:13.10]You know what I'm trying to say.
[91:13.94]We need to find a new string.
[91:16.04]Where's the bear?
[91:23.22]Alright, new string.
[91:26.30]We're going to go with this one.
[91:29.98]Nope, this one.
[91:32.74]Go down.
[91:33.40]Nothing else leads up?
[91:35.30]Well, upstairs is right here.
[91:44.12]Just go down.
[91:44.63]I'm gonna follow this one.
[91:48.15]There's two down here.
[91:58.91]Saves every two seconds because it knows that you're gonna fuck this up over and over again.
[92:03.96]Both in here.
[92:04.76]I'm gonna have the gun ready because who knows what's behind this door.
[92:09.82]Guy.
[92:12.72]Okay, here it is.
[92:14.62]Where's a window?
[92:15.32]I need a window.
[92:17.42]Is that a window?
[92:19.92]No, that's the kitchen.
[92:20.67]Okay, there's a window right there.
[92:25.39]Lord, okay.
[92:26.21]One, two, three, go.
[92:29.45]Got it.
[92:32.16]Right?
[92:33.04]Yeah.
[92:39.07]That's a real bear!
[92:39.61]That's the bear I was just fighting!
[92:40.91]It's gonna come to life!
[92:42.19]That bear's gonna come to life.
[92:43.76]There's no way that bear does not come to life.
[93:11.41]How am I on health?
[93:15.19]I'll smash this.
[93:15.97]I have full health.
[93:25.93]I'm going to have to run up the stairs with one of these.
[93:31.58]Only one guy?
[93:32.12]This is probably so old.
[93:54.50]Come on fucking come on man come on Fucking R1 not R2 Boom head explode
[94:26.08]Any more ammo?
[94:26.58]Yes, there is.
[94:31.28]I'm pretty good at making people's head explode though, aren't I?
[94:35.25]I would say.
[94:38.23]Ooh, a skew locker.
[94:41.67]That gets a little bit of ammo for my gun.
[94:45.47]I already got full ammo.
[94:48.23]Sick.
[94:49.81]I got full battery.
[94:51.68]Let's find that trail again.
[94:55.19]Ah, shit.
[94:57.29]It's Ron called.
[95:00.55]No, there it is.
[95:06.18]Once you hear the beep beeps is when you know you're out there.
[95:09.58]Oh, boy.
[95:14.08]You gotta tell me I gotta get through that window?
[95:19.91]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[95:22.55]That's a basketball shot!
[95:25.27]I don't know if I... This is a game at the midway at the fair.
[95:30.63]God fucking damn it.
[95:40.93]This is that football game.
[95:42.27]We have to throw the football in.
[95:47.68]I gotta get through that fucking football window.
[96:11.38]Put this down!
[96:12.16]Put it down!
[96:17.56]Throw it!
[96:18.50]Oh shit!
[96:29.07]That's so much lag!
[96:31.05]I could probably do that without... 6 frames a second.
[96:35.57]I really could.
[96:46.65]Let's get rid of them.
[96:47.23]They're going to come down the hall.
[96:54.31]Fuck.
[96:55.25]I'm going to get this.
[96:56.68]It's going to happen.
[97:03.00]Damn it!
[97:05.30]I will get this.
[97:08.52]Because I want you guys to be able to watch me do this impossible task.
[97:16.33]I know there's another window.
[97:18.38]There's another window right there, but for principle, because of principle, I have to do this.
[97:36.05]Yes!
[97:36.83]See?
[97:40.13]Got it.
[97:43.53]Got it.
[97:51.10]He didn't believe in me.
[97:52.82]Nobody believes me that I could get it through the fair game.
[97:57.49]That's a hundred points when you throw the football through the square.
[98:03.39]The game froze, yeah.
[98:04.69]The game didn't know what to do.
[98:08.39]Even the game couldn't believe it.
[98:10.11]It's like, what the fuck just happened?
[98:11.91]Did he just throw that through the football window?
[98:15.45]Sick fuck.
[98:16.15]I guess it didn't work.
[98:18.87]We need to find another string.
[98:24.88]This takes us back.
[98:27.76]Where does this lead to?
[98:30.80]Secret?
[98:32.30]Secret?
[98:33.49]I think it's a secret.
[98:37.35]Uh, kind of.
[98:43.61]I got full ammo?
[98:48.39]Yeah.
[98:50.42]Anything else of note?
[98:52.04]No, nothing.
[98:54.26]We did unlock a shortcut, though.
[99:00.52]Shortcut.
[99:12.09]Why would you punch me?
[99:12.95]Shoot me!
[99:13.97]Shoot me in the face!
[99:14.97]You don't have to punch me with your hand!
[99:21.77]What a mess.
[99:25.33]What a fucking mess.
[99:32.76]He punched you for the same reason.
[99:33.88]He accidentally hit R2.
[99:37.16]Apparently I got shot in the head there.
[99:38.86]Apparently.
[99:41.99]What a fucking mess.
[99:47.29]Now I know what to do here.
[99:48.15]I'm just going to sit right here.
[99:52.08]This game looks like it plays well.
[99:56.60]Well, it's not that the game doesn't play well, it just runs at a really low frame rate.
[100:01.04]And I do not play first person shooters with a controller.
[100:06.34]I may as well be eight years old.
[100:17.06]Except for that one.
[100:19.52]That's a headshot.
[100:21.06]Right in the radio.
[100:23.45]Right in the radio.
[100:24.67]Yeah!
[100:25.22]I see, I killed his radio!
[100:27.94]And I killed his gun!
[100:29.96]Two of his most trusted companions, both dead.
[100:39.65]This is like a Banjo-Kazooie world.
[100:42.43]They're sentient.
[100:48.89]Alright.
[100:50.22]Where's the next string?
[100:53.83]We have to go back upstairs.
[100:54.73]We've got both of these.
[100:55.93]There was a third one up here.
[100:58.38]It goes this way.
[101:00.18]I've got to go back down.
[101:05.20]It comes over here, down.
[101:13.84]Oh, God.
[101:14.78]Thankfully, the window is right here.
[101:16.84]So this is going to be an easy one.
[101:21.12]Do not bounce back into the house.
[101:25.41]Okay.
[101:27.11]If that came back in... That would have come really bad.
[101:34.52]Yeah, book your appointments.
[101:39.06]The surgeon is in.
[101:41.20]Back in action.
[101:43.14]You know, he had a few malpractice suits.
[101:45.98]But it's alright.
[101:48.44]He went back and got retrained.
[101:52.37]I've got to go back up the stairs.
[101:54.10]The last ones are up in the attic.
[102:01.84]Where's the base unit?
[102:10.71]We've got to get back to the base unit.
[102:15.73]These two come out here.
[102:17.21]They go up to the other unit.
[102:21.52]Just gonna make my way up the stairs.
[102:23.56]Where were those stairs?
[102:25.76]Where were those stairs?
[102:29.62]Not this way.
[102:36.26]Uh, where were the stairs that went up the stairs?
[102:40.85]Over here?
[102:44.75]Where the hell were they?
[102:45.53]I saw them.
[102:47.21]Not right here.
[102:48.95]Oh, there we go.
[102:49.49]Open up these stairs.
[103:00.37]Guns run, just in case there is an alien up here.
[103:03.14]There's one that connects right here.
[103:10.16]Where's the nearest window?
[103:24.75]Any friends?
[103:25.19]I don't think I can walk across this.
[103:30.83]Where are you?
[103:31.67]Down?
[103:32.95]Where the fuck are you?
[103:38.35]He's shooting me from the bottom.
[103:41.68]Where is this guy?
[103:42.50]He's freaking me out.
[103:43.26]I can hear him talk.
[103:44.04]I can hear his voice.
[103:44.90]And now I hear him again.
[103:57.89]You get the riot gun.
[103:59.39]No, fuck that.
[104:02.75]Okay, well there is a window here.
[104:05.83]Just in case I don't know where to go.
[104:17.91]Where are you, man?
[104:19.62]I want to get rid of this guy before I go anywhere.
[104:21.10]Do you have any medicine in your medicine cabinet?
[104:27.96]What kind of fucking place is this?
[104:38.97]Just taking a look.
[104:41.93]Use the shotgun to kill the bear.
[104:43.07]I gotta get back out to... Out here.
[104:48.59]This is where the trail is.
[104:51.91]There he is.
[104:52.72]He's down.
[104:57.04]How did I not kill him?
[105:04.16]Marshmallows came out of that guy.
[105:07.37]I marshmallowed this dude.
[105:09.03]Is that his brain?
[105:13.33]Jesus Christ, okay.
[105:16.35]Bring it out.
[105:16.80]There's one down here.
[105:18.16]All right.
[105:29.16]Move out of the way.
[105:31.62]This leads up to here.
[105:38.32]They both are in here.
[105:41.24]No, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[105:45.21]This is the shortcut to get down here.
[105:51.43]Shot him in the leg and his head exploded.
[105:53.07]Perfect.
[105:55.60]There's another guy down here.
[106:00.84]Oh, you fucking assholes.
[106:04.06]I just... I just wanted... Quick scope.
[106:11.39]I don't get collapsed on.
[106:13.67]I'm the one that does the collapsing.
[106:22.08]Where the hell does this go?
[106:28.78]What the fuck?
[106:35.32]I'm like walking in circles.
[106:36.36]This is the same string.
[106:37.48]This is the same string.
[106:44.15]It's going out here now.
[106:46.83]I've lost it.
[106:48.19]I've lost it.
[106:49.89]I've lost it.
[106:53.27]I've lost it.
[106:56.04]We're gonna go to this one.
[107:03.96]I've lost it.
[107:08.99]This one's, uh, uh, but wha, huh?
[107:13.12]What is going, where?
[107:23.09]What is happening?
[107:27.39]Where the fuck does this one go?
[107:42.24]Oh, for the love of God.
[107:43.12]Goodbye.
[107:51.82]Save the game.
[107:57.00]It's the bear wire.
[107:58.18]I hear them coming up the stairs.
[108:03.68]Gotta get a better angle.
[108:09.79]Better shooting angle.
[108:12.45]Mm-hmm.
[108:16.81]Mm-hmm.
[108:18.57]No biggie.
[108:20.97]Hey, I'll be signing autographs after the end of the fucking program.
[108:25.84]Hey, I'll be signing autographs after the end of the fucking program.
[108:30.44]Bingo.
[108:30.96]It's the last one.
[108:35.20]Is the last one up here, too?
[108:40.23]Last one is over here.
[108:43.56]Which goes around into here.
[108:49.46]Alright, the final one.
[108:52.37]Everybody say, Hail Mary!
[108:56.05]When I throw it.
[108:58.67]I have to go up.
[109:06.90]I want to hear at least a couple of Hallelujahs when I throw it in the air.
[109:17.66]Did I turn this light off?
[109:25.84]So how am I supposed to get through there?
[109:27.78]I gotta go back up.
[109:37.64]I gotta go up and like around, but how?
[109:40.26]I don't understand.
[109:46.42]I'm up the stairs again.
[109:47.32]This brings me out here.
[109:52.07]Which in turn... Where is the wire?
[109:54.73]Right there.
[110:02.74]Right.
[110:03.36]Well... That... That's not... In the bathtub?
[110:11.34]It's gonna be in a bathtub or something.
[110:20.01]Where the fuck is it?
[110:20.67]On the other side here?
[110:28.66]There it is.
[110:29.06]Alright, ready?
[110:30.64]This is it.
[110:31.06]It's going right out the door.
[110:33.66]Hail Mary.
[110:36.72]Goodbye!
[110:37.30]Once all of the explosives are taken care of, get back to the detonator on the door as fast as you can.
[110:47.07]The countdown will be triggered.
[110:52.72]Hail Mary.
[110:56.84]Fall of grace.
[111:06.27]Pray for our sinners.
[111:07.67]I thought I just broke the game.
[111:18.69]Alright, saving content.
[111:19.67]Get me back to the main menu.
[111:20.77]Come on, get me back to the main menu!
[111:32.43]How do I get to the main menu?
[111:33.59]Come on, main menu!
[111:37.21]Alexa, main menu!
[111:43.66]There's a guy right here.
[111:53.06]I'm lost.
[111:53.54]I'm lost.
[111:58.02]I just want to go back home.
[112:01.62]And I don't know how to get there.
[112:04.69]What about the GPS?
[112:05.53]Can I press the GPS button?
[112:10.37]Nope.
[112:11.07]This is back where I just was.
[112:18.92]Okay, I'm just going to follow this cable.
[112:21.66]in any direction and see where it takes me.
[112:26.33]Hopefully this cable brings us back to the main menu, guys.
[112:31.37]There we go.
[112:31.93]There it is.
[112:34.31]This is a main menu cable.
[112:38.41]No, I don't want to go, because I don't want to do that.
[112:41.70]Oh my god, what the fuck have I done?
[112:46.70]There it is!
[112:47.18]This is the main menu!
[112:49.81]Just bring me down to the... There.
[112:54.83]No.
[112:55.23]What?
[112:56.23]No!
[112:58.00]Ugh.
[113:01.48]There, finally.
[113:02.60]What's counting down?
[113:03.52]Uh, there's a number pad.
[113:04.34]Alright, that's... That's 4, 8, 12, 16 button number pad.
[113:20.17]We've got two, it's a dual core processor.
[113:23.93]It's got a key card.
[113:24.71]This is definitely an AMD chip.
[113:29.71]We got two long, one short cord.
[113:34.17]That's correct.
[113:37.19]We've also got a fan.
[113:42.85]There are how many blinking lights?
[113:44.06]There are three, no, there are three blinking lights.
[113:53.65]It's 120 volt.
[113:54.05]120 by 120.
[113:54.15]120.
[113:54.17]120 by 12.
[113:54.41]Huh?
[113:54.55]It's a time limit.
[114:22.39]You're on a timer apparently.
[114:25.07]Before the fox die kills you.
[114:27.91]Jesus Christ.
[114:34.90]What do you mean it's on a timer like every bomb?
[114:38.50]I got rid of all the bombs.
[114:39.74]This is just the device that needs to open the door.
[114:41.80]And there's a little bit of like plastic.
[114:43.90]That's a plastic.
[114:44.45]Whatever.
[114:44.81]All right, here we go.
[114:48.99]Bingo.
[114:49.63]Oh, 50 seconds.
[114:52.84]Hello?
[114:53.86]Hello?
[114:54.18]Yes, I'd like to tell you what's on here.
[114:57.02]Describe the detonator.
[114:58.06]Yes.
[114:58.86]Please, let me do that.
[115:01.02]It's not letting me do that.
[115:05.60]Get over it!
[115:07.17]No, that's not 10.
[115:08.65]Go back.
[115:08.89]No, no, no.
[115:09.67]16.
[115:12.09]Too long, one short.
[115:14.65]Three blinking lights.
[115:15.31]120 by 12.
[115:17.05]One more.
[115:19.63]We got two canisters.
[115:22.42]All right, we're good.
[115:23.58]Now we can sit here and gloat a little bit.
[115:27.98]Fucking smartest motherfucker there is.
[115:29.82]We get to five seconds and we'll see what she says.
[115:34.74]Perfect.
[115:37.41]Oh, that doesn't stop the timer.
[115:43.67]I thought that was gonna stop the timer and it was gonna be like complete.
[115:47.69]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[115:48.71]All right, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:49.53]So I have to submit it and then I have to cut the right wire.
[116:00.12]There we go now see that was fucking stupid you guys saw that I didn't get to do this last time 16 too long one short three blinking lights 120 by 12 two canisters submit perfect go What do you mean cut the cable on the right like this one I
[116:27.87]So what happens if you didn't do that perfect?
[116:38.98]Would she have told you to cut the one on the left?
[116:40.34]That's funny.
[116:48.31]Anything else?
[116:48.99]Any other people in here that I need to be aware of?
[116:52.87]How did she know it was on the right?
[116:54.29]How did she even know the makeup?
[116:57.15]of that device.
[116:58.63]Did I send a picture?
[116:59.49]Maybe I did before.
[117:00.23]I don't think I did.
[117:04.84]Well, we know what happened to the bear.
[117:16.98]Now, is this one of those head-exploding ones?
[117:19.80]Where if you shoot somebody right in the face with this magnum, you Clint Eastwood their head across like a canvas, right?
[117:26.82]There's a reason why they give me this.
[117:39.28]What makes me special?
[117:43.77]Photographic memory, vocal cords, personal hygiene, fighting ability, blood type.
[117:50.31]What makes me special?
[117:53.32]My personal hygiene.
[117:55.08]It's blood type or photogenic memory.
[118:00.08]My fighting ability.
[118:07.92]What is this, fighting ability?
[118:09.30]What's special about me?
[118:14.82]Oh, we gotta get the correct password.
[118:17.60]Alright, it's vocal cords.
[118:26.53]My child.
[118:26.71]We're gonna have to fight something in this room.
[118:28.45]The Ouroboros.
[118:57.87]I feel like I'm in a VR game in here, the way what I'm doing with my head.
[119:01.43]Oh, wow.
[119:02.27]Cool.
[119:02.65]This is so cool.
[119:28.83]Just recently found hope in the Oro.
[119:32.37]This was never my intention.
[119:35.07]In fact, I've spent the majority of my life opposing the Oro.
[119:39.15]They were responsible for the death of my wife and child so many years ago.
[119:43.57]This has put my nephew and me at odds, resulting in the current state of my affairs.
[119:49.15]He will stop at nothing to become one of them.
[119:53.07]And this is why our paths are crossing once again.
[119:57.00]Be careful, Ethan.
[119:59.00]The Oro's power is intoxicating.
[120:12.85]Nice.
[120:16.01]This is harder than it looks.
[120:26.02]I'm gonna stop because like... Could you guys see me closing one eye?
[120:36.31]That was the only reason I did that.
[120:41.74]I just gotta take... Look, I'm gonna die.
[120:44.56]I blame my incompetence on...
[120:58.02]Buy one of those eye-tracking aim things and stream with it.
[121:00.22]I actually would want to do that.
[121:01.18]That'd be fun.
[121:10.63]Oh my god.
[121:16.87]Okay.
[121:17.55]Give me a break.
[121:20.06]Oh my lord, man.
[121:32.16]Seriously.
[121:33.52]I feel like I have to be drunk to play with... You know what I'm gonna say.
[121:37.34]I'm not gonna say it.
[121:38.48]I'm not gonna say it.
[121:43.12]I'm not gonna say it.
[121:44.50]We don't need guns, okay?
[121:47.67]Guns cause problems for us.
[121:49.81]So we're gonna have to do something else.
[121:57.29]Give me a lamppost.
[121:59.11]Just give me a lamppost.
[122:05.53]I can't.
[122:06.05]I have to.
[122:06.51]I actually have to use this gun.
[122:08.51]No, I don't.
[122:09.59]Never say never.
[122:14.35]There's gotta be a brick over here, or a piece of wood that I can just rip off the wall.
[122:19.11]In this fucking creep's basement.
[122:27.66]Good enough.
[122:34.49]Fucking reloading, huh buddy?
[122:38.23]We don't need guns.
[122:52.13]You just gotta smell when they reload.
[122:57.59]Put down the cellphone.
[123:03.22]Huh?
[123:06.06]What is going on right now?
[123:07.58]Do you see this?
[123:09.66]Of course you do.
[123:19.34]Is the whole place coming down?
[123:20.43]Do I need to escape?
[123:23.67]Oh, that's just a nice fire.
[123:25.19]So can I leave?
[123:33.70]Dude, how was I supposed to know you were gonna do this?
[123:38.34]I drove into the house with a John Deere tractor.
[123:42.38]They'll kill you.
[123:43.70]If that's what they'll do.
[123:46.26]I want a soda.
[123:46.70]I want a Coca-Cola Classic.
[123:47.44]Getting that urge.
[124:01.68]Right now, Dorlin and his agents are acting as if nothing is out of the ordinary.
[124:05.16]The commissioner is here, and he and Dorlin are acting like old college buddies.
[124:09.24]I mean, the city is crumbling all around us.
[124:11.50]Riots, fires, murders, and now this?
[124:14.48]What's going on?
[124:16.73]I'm sorry.
[124:17.19]Stop playing this game.
[124:18.53]I'm just worried something bad is about to happen.
[124:21.77]We're too deep.
[124:22.71]We're in too deep.
[124:23.47]There's only another couple hours of this game left.
[124:25.65]Why is the commissioner there?
[124:32.73]After all my hard work, the house exploded anyways.
[124:36.93]Couple hours too many.
[124:37.63]Yeah, I said the same thing about Harvester, but I truly believed that there was only like an hour.
[124:58.80]This guy's driving the car not the same way the car's moving.
[125:01.14]He's fucking ripping the wheel back and forth.
[125:04.04]If you drive like this, everybody in the car dies.
[125:09.38]Look at how vicious this is.
[125:10.69]Jesus, man.
[125:10.97]Calm down.
[125:11.21]Alright.
[125:11.41]We got...
[125:27.42]Toe stomp and nutcracker kick combos.
[125:33.41]Alright.
[125:41.25]I feel like we are getting to the end of the game.
[125:45.97]How many chapters are in the game?
[125:47.01]Like 10 or 11?
[125:47.43]This is 8?
[125:47.65]9?
[125:47.67]That's your call.
[125:48.15]Whatever you do, do it quietly.
[126:16.98]Okay.
[126:19.38]How do I do the nutcracker?
[126:21.30]Obviously we have to do that one.
[126:25.21]Toe stomp.
[126:25.79]Does that mean that I step on their toe and they get hurt?
[126:30.13]Look, if somebody gets close enough where they're going to step on your toe for a melee ability, you're not doing something right.
[126:38.20]You're doing something very opposite of right.
[126:40.44]Wrong.
[126:44.76]Sneak onto the bus without killing the guards.
[126:53.65]Why are the guards fighting each other?
[127:02.40]Is anybody else confused?
[127:03.34]Why did this just happen?
[127:04.94]Is that my friend?
[127:11.52]I thought we were supposed to be sneaking.
[127:14.54]He just ran in.
[127:19.10]Alright, nutcracker kick combo.
[127:22.89]I guess that's one way of sneaking onto the bus.
[127:26.37]We didn't sneak onto a bus.
[127:29.11]You sprinted over here and started swinging.
[127:32.67]Do I get to drive?
[127:37.96]What the fuck is this?
[127:45.90]Why did you kill your uncle?
[127:48.42]He's dead.
[127:49.77]No, no, he's not.
[127:50.97]He's alive.
[127:52.15]He's just tired.
[127:55.29]That's the joke.
[127:56.29]I guess it was sarcastic, I guess.
[127:57.79]Jesus!
[128:11.36]So this is the killer from the first game.
[128:21.03]This is the extreme killer.
[128:24.77]Extreme.
[128:25.23]Mr. X, right?
[128:31.49]Why don't we just kill him now?
[128:37.09]Get on the bus.
[128:59.29]So get like... We need to... Drive the car!
[129:01.77]Drive it!
[129:02.15]Step on the gas right now and he'll slam his back against the wall.
[129:05.09]It'll hurt me, but it's okay.
[129:06.91]He won't get away.
[129:07.53]You should've drove... You should've drove and stepped on the gas.
[129:17.83]Get on... I don't know if that's what he did, but hopefully that's what he did.
[129:26.16]Somebody drove the bus.
[129:34.55]I don't think it was my friend.
[129:39.03]That was just a loading screen for the next video game asset.
[129:44.11]Oh well.
[129:46.99]We tried.
[129:50.42]There he is.
[129:50.82]Okay.
[130:01.56]He's lying on a perfect board for his body.
[130:04.84]Where did you find this?
[130:06.72]Oh, there he is.
[130:07.10]Is that him?
[130:12.08]I need to drink this.
[130:12.68]I didn't want to pick this up.
[130:17.24]And I dropped it and it broke.
[130:18.28]Great.
[130:18.89]Good work, Jeremy.
[130:22.51]Is that guy holding a shotgun in one hand?
[130:36.57]Yeah, take the shot.
[130:38.69]You got plenty of time.
[130:40.09]You can do it.
[130:41.29]One of you guys, unless there's a fucking monster behind me and you're trying to tell me not to turn around, somebody needs to take a shot.
[130:51.31]It's gonna happen eventually.
[130:52.15]Don't move.
[130:59.60]Nobody move.
[131:02.88]Nobody fucking move.
[131:12.06]Got it.
[131:12.34]That's all, that's, that's what I wanted.
[131:17.36]Alright, I'm gonna take the shot.
[131:23.76]You guys, you guys were talking about Wile E. Coyote cartoon shit?
[131:28.34]You mean when Wile E. Coyote holds the sign when he falls off the cliff?
[131:32.85]He drops and the sign stays?
[131:38.99]There it is.
[131:41.13]What are you doing?
[131:48.29]Got her.
[131:53.33]Was there a bowling pin?
[131:55.05]No, I'm going to keep the silenced PP7 for sure.
[132:05.08]What else in the bowling alley?
[132:07.72]A bowling ball.
[132:09.90]Perfect.
[132:10.40]Are there pins I can bowl?
[132:13.00]I mean, that would be kind of fun.
[132:14.90]Let's try.
[132:17.58]No, you can't steal those.
[132:21.52]You know how bad that would hurt?
[132:24.62]Imagine getting a fucking nine-pound bowling ball thrown into your face.
[132:32.59]Get out of the way.
[132:39.89]I want to do the nutcracker to somebody.
[132:45.56]Damn it.
[132:45.96]Stop it.
[132:46.36]I just want to do the nutcracker.
[132:47.38]That's all I care about.
[132:52.32]Was that it?
[132:52.74]I do have that still.
[133:01.84]It's over there.
[133:03.88]See that guy?
[133:06.90]That peak?
[133:09.36]Is that the guy I need to chase?
[133:11.04]Probably is.
[133:11.36]Ethan, come in.
[133:17.02]What is that?
[133:26.96]It went... bounced back to hit.
[133:31.94]That was perfect.
[133:40.53]Let's play catch.
[133:42.79]I love playing catch with the enemies.
[133:44.19]It's perfect.
[133:49.97]Alright, now you throw it back.
[133:51.77]He tripped over it.
[133:52.97]He tripped over the bowling pin.
[133:55.29]There's a guy right here.
[134:12.31]Come on, just like peek your head around so I can get this.
[134:15.66]I want this so bad.
[134:18.02]Fine, forget it.
[134:19.88]How do I pull up my gun?
[134:20.86]Is it L3?
[134:26.86]I don't know.
[134:39.09]Right in the back.
[134:39.65]And... Dead?
[134:40.01]Yeah, he is now.
[134:54.11]Rolling ball.
[134:56.25]Gumball machine?
[134:56.80]Oh, you actually can hold the gumball machine.
[135:01.16]Where's he hiding?
[135:10.68]I can hear him.
[135:12.56]There he is.
[135:18.65]I think I was supposed to talk to that guy.
[135:22.89]Well, I'm sorry, man, but you are kind of in a weird place.
[135:39.30]Where are you throwing shit from?
[135:40.42]Oh, great.
[135:44.73]I need to pull my gun out, and I don't know how to do it.
[135:47.65]It's holstered.
[135:54.23]God damn it.
[135:55.25]No, I can't move.
[135:56.09]This guy's got like a dentist equipment on his head.
[136:03.68]What?
[136:16.71]Got it.
[136:17.07]Okay, it's the D-pad.
[136:28.00]That guy was camouflaged.
[136:35.41]God damn it.
[136:37.79]This thing is so slow.
[136:46.84]Fuck you!
[136:47.80]God damn it!
[136:50.10]Oh, just...
[136:56.51]I can do it too, man.
[136:57.41]I can throw bricks too.
[137:01.63]Where?
[137:06.45]Can I put this guy's head in the fry lighter?
[137:08.23]Seriously.
[137:14.84]Down on the D-pad.
[137:22.34]Now I need health again.
[137:30.66]Fuck off.
[137:34.42]Nothing in the medicine cabinets.
[137:36.58]It's a public bathroom.
[137:37.46]They don't have medicine cabinets.
[137:40.58]There we go.
[137:45.24]What is this?
[137:45.72]A single shot elephant rifle?
[137:51.47]Whatever the hell it is.
[137:55.11]I don't know.
[138:00.77]What is the goal here?
[138:03.61]Search the bowling alley for SKX.
[138:08.15]Don't kill any guards.
[138:10.71]Heaven forbid, don't kill any bowling alley guards.
[138:25.88]Where did he run off to?
[138:26.76]I didn't even see him.
[138:30.77]Didn't really explore over here.
[138:34.43]That looks like a correct way to go.
[138:39.07]Unfortunately, it's not.
[138:47.23]Well... Knock over that pin.
[138:52.99]Alright, I'll get it first try.
[139:02.02]No throwing either, we have to bowl it correctly.
[139:06.76]Shit, I'll get it.
[139:08.83]This is probably an achievement for this.
[139:12.07]I'm an achievement man.
[139:16.43]No.
[139:18.21]Little to the right.
[139:20.99]Like right... here?
[139:26.03]Right here.
[139:32.67]There's evidence over here.
[139:34.04]I don't give a shit about doing police work.
[139:45.59]I got it.
[139:46.33]I got it.
[139:46.89]I got it.
[139:47.71]That went right through it.
[139:48.65]This is not even a real pin.
[139:50.49]Look.
[139:51.63]I got knocked over.
[139:52.33]I win.
[139:52.71]Where's my rifle?
[140:00.62]Connect the names.
[140:01.66]Where's the head?
[140:02.84]There's a head over here?
[140:05.46]Head?
[140:05.56]There's a person's head over here.
[140:07.76]Female head.
[140:34.85]And your name is... Uncle.
[140:38.71]Uncle Mayor Director Magic Man.
[140:44.59]Uncle... The mayor?
[140:49.89]The mayor.
[140:52.81]Uncle... Uncle Mars.
[140:55.07]Uncle Mars Farrell.
[140:58.15]No, this is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[140:59.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[141:00.11]Go back.
[141:02.42]How do I go back?
[141:05.31]No, don't take a blurry-ass picture.
[141:09.07]I want to delete this shit.
[141:10.87]Exit.
[141:11.77]No.
[141:19.01]Don't submit.
[141:19.89]I want to delete this.
[141:23.93]How do I just delete this?
[141:30.75]Okay.
[141:31.87]Uncle.
[141:32.33]No, no, no.
[141:32.71]Alright.
[141:32.97]Alright.
[141:34.63]We can start over now.
[141:37.09]Okay, put name to magician.
[141:43.92]Whose bag is this?
[141:46.78]Woman's purse?
[141:47.30]That's a bowling bag.
[141:48.46]A bowling ball goes in here.
[141:53.28]Pharrell, Pharrell, Pharrell, Pharrell.
[141:55.43]That's not... That's not correct.
[142:06.51]Okay, bowling bag.
[142:08.93]It's filled with blood.
[142:14.05]Owner of the bag.
[142:20.10]Is there a name on that bag?
[142:23.48]There's an X on the bag.
[142:25.22]This is Mr. X's bowling bag.
[142:34.76]Is that all I need to know?
[142:36.06]That's Mr. X's bowling bag.
[142:47.55]So who's the magician?
[142:54.00]The magician is... X for Pharrell.
[143:07.06]Examining the bag when the objective is to connect the na- I know, but I'm trying- I can't delete these.
[143:19.67]Fucking God, I want to just fail it so I can do it again.
[143:23.63]Because I can't just get a clean slate.
[143:28.10]Just submit it.
[143:29.48]Average.
[143:30.02]Don't care.
[143:31.84]I can't fucking go back and do it again.
[143:36.60]Good.
[143:37.14]I didn't get poor, so that means I get to actually do it.
[143:39.12]I get to win.
[143:47.99]Now I have to do this part.
[143:48.93]Why did it let me do this in the first place?
[143:57.01]Okay, so this is... It's a female head.
[143:59.58]It's a fucking bowling bag.
[144:00.72]There's blood in that bag.
[144:05.37]And this, it's got, it's SKX's bag.
[144:07.35]What a creep.
[144:07.81]God damn.
[144:08.01]Average.
[144:08.37]No, average and perfect together means good.
[144:35.76]If you get an A, if you get a 100 on a test and you get a 70 on a test, that's like a B minus.
[144:43.14]Average together.
[144:43.58]That's like a B plus.
[144:45.44]So, yeah.
[144:50.03]So I think that's all I have to do there.
[144:52.19]I've got my evidence.
[144:58.15]Is there anything else I can do besides crawl through this?
[145:00.64]Because that's what we're going to do.
[145:10.13]Bad guy?
[145:10.98]Human?
[145:15.40]They're hiding.
[145:16.00]Both of them hiding behind the corner.
[145:17.90]I would assume.
[145:19.36]No?
[145:21.54]Still have two guns.
[145:28.67]The first test was 80% of your grade.
[145:30.67]That's right.
[145:35.33]But the second test was also...
[145:38.73]80 or 90% of my grade.
[145:46.66]Say goodbye.
[145:47.28]I don't know why.
[145:50.84]What's going on?
[145:52.80]Why did I decide to start talking like this?
[145:57.36]I can't turn it off.
[146:00.12]Wasn't there a lady that had some type of migraine problem?
[146:04.94]She had something wrong with her head and she got a French accent for the rest of her life?
[146:10.04]Didn't that happen?
[146:12.84]An actual total medical mystery, right?
[146:20.41]I think that just happened to me.
[146:33.39]It was a Russian accent.
[146:36.13]Yeah, there was a lady in the news that had a brain aneurysm or something.
[146:41.46]She had a bad migraine.
[146:43.54]When she got out of the migraine, she had an accent that she never had before.
[146:53.70]Can't go in this door, right?
[146:59.40]Keep up the accent joke for weeks.
[147:03.27]That would never happen.
[147:05.63]Are there any bullets left in this?
[147:06.51]Let's find out.
[147:10.39]There's two.
[147:13.86]Well, this don't matter anymore.
[147:16.92]It's back, boys!
[147:18.76]It's back, boys and girls!
[147:22.32]The best item.
[147:24.68]It only took us 80% into the game to get it.
[147:29.92]Like 90% of the way through the game, we finally get to use it.
[147:33.96]The best item.
[147:43.04]We already went this way.
[147:48.98]Had to earn it.
[147:52.18]Had to unlock it.
[147:56.31]Nowhere else to go.
[147:58.19]So... I guess I just have to do something.
[148:00.69]Can I break the lock?
[148:06.24]He voted?
[148:07.02]There's a way to go over there.
[148:11.93]I can't really move anything.
[148:13.01]This can't be smashed open.
[148:21.98]This can't be kicked open.
[148:26.90]So what am I missing here?
[148:38.52]Is there another door I didn't go in?
[148:43.49]Oh.
[148:45.95]I guess we're going up.
[148:55.33]It's the Wolverine door.
[149:01.63]The Golem enemy's gonna be up here, the weird snake people will be up here too.
[149:04.95]Yep, there comes a snake.
[149:18.55]Get the chair out of the way, for the love of God.
[149:21.25]Whoa.
[149:28.26]Photograph torture devices.
[149:29.42]This is the most fucked up realm that's been in both games.
[149:42.41]Photograph the torture device.
[149:44.61]That guy's in it!
[149:45.25]That guy's actually still in this thing!
[149:49.52]I gotta put him out first, right?
[149:50.68]I'm gonna put this guy out.
[149:54.97]It won't let me aim at him.
[149:58.47]We saved him.
[150:19.33]I want to open this up so the dogs can get out.
[150:25.43]I can't break those locks.
[150:27.35]Why is there gas?
[150:29.49]Take a picture of the torture device.
[150:31.99]Like this?
[150:32.51]What is this?
[150:33.99]Is this like a freezer?
[150:34.85]Do you lie on this and it pumps in Freon and it gets really cold?
[150:39.76]I already got it, right?
[150:49.03]Oh, there's three torture devices.
[150:50.41]That's one.
[150:50.97]This is two.
[150:51.95]Whatever.
[150:52.37]Take a picture of the electricity?
[150:56.99]No.
[150:57.50]Why am I taking these pictures?
[151:19.53]Drinking the booze found in the torture room is a great idea.
[151:23.49]What about, like, the dog torture device?
[151:38.17]Well, fuck it.
[151:41.66]This is the right way.
[151:42.96]What's over there?
[151:43.44]Nothing.
[151:44.48]Pipe.
[151:44.72]We're not gonna take it.
[151:45.48]We need to use the door.
[151:51.72]Another one.
[151:54.88]Stop zooming in so much.
[151:56.20]I can't control the zoom.
[151:57.20]It does it automatically.
[151:59.30]So when I pull up the camera right here, I can't do anything about this.
[152:02.88]This is as far as it has to be in this far.
[152:06.30]There's no way to pull it out.
[152:07.72]I just have to focus.
[152:14.63]Unless they're in another room.
[152:16.35]But whatever.
[152:17.05]Okay.
[152:33.72]Torture device.
[152:35.18]Torture device.
[152:37.66]Get him in one.
[152:39.12]Get him, put him in here.
[152:41.66]God damn it.
[152:42.19]Come on.
[152:45.41]Torture device.
[152:46.65]They're all in here.
[152:47.85]There it is.
[152:48.13]All right.
[152:48.41]Here we go.
[152:51.39]That tortured the fuck out of him right there.
[152:54.63]Wow.
[152:55.05]That was gruesome.
[153:11.02]It just gives it to you.
[153:12.08]I thought it was going to have to make me look around.
[153:18.36]Bans for gore.
[153:21.58]I ban this.
[153:35.49]I pissed the whip that guy and shot him at the same time.
[153:44.69]That guy got knee-jerk reaction killed.
[153:53.73]See?
[153:54.37]He's in the chill chamber.
[153:56.11]This is the worst of them all.
[154:03.21]See how he's shaking and shivering?
[154:10.99]But, you know what?
[154:12.49]When you're inside the chill chamber, at least you're protected.
[154:14.77]Because I can't hit him.
[154:21.67]This is how you protect yourself from sharks.
[154:23.31]This is not even that bad.
[154:24.37]I don't think I can even kill him.
[154:27.69]No, I can't kill him.
[154:30.21]Maybe I can.
[154:36.65]I can just shock him.
[154:37.45]That's all I can do.
[154:39.61]Alright, well.
[154:44.05]That's that.
[154:53.56]What is this?
[154:54.56]Foosball rod?
[154:58.08]Trophies?
[154:58.66]I guess I could pick up... No.
[155:00.13]Trophy's boring.
[155:01.89]Foosball rod is cool.
[155:11.78]Alright, that was weird.
[155:12.82]That's all I got to say about that.
[155:15.18]That was weird.
[155:21.84]It's just too bright.
[155:22.51]I can't look at the screen like this.
[155:25.05]Sorry.
[155:25.89]There was some story and shit there.
[155:31.67]I can't listen to it because it's the... The HDR, whatever the hell this is, is too overpowering.
[155:39.82]pet the dogs, I would have.
[155:40.88]I would have loved to have done that.
[155:53.92]Nope.
[155:54.28]I just went crazy for a minute.
[155:55.74]There it is.
[156:02.29]I lost my rod.
[156:05.37]It's alright.
[156:06.03]I can always get a new one.
[156:07.53]Oh, what?
[156:13.58]Yeah, the game did just get really bright.
[156:15.59]You're not crazy.
[156:20.11]There's another one in here that I have to get rid of.
[156:25.19]I sprinted through this too fast.
[156:28.63]Come on, give me something.
[156:31.63]Anything.
[156:32.55]I'll take anything.
[156:36.33]Case in point.
[156:38.65]I'll take one of the boring default first items in the game.
[156:48.72]Over here.
[156:54.58]No.
[156:56.72]Over here.
[156:57.02]Uh-huh.
[157:02.95]I need to go that way.
[157:05.77]How does one go that way?
[157:09.53]Climb through?
[157:10.81]Climb in like the...
[157:14.50]I can't believe you can actually open those.
[157:15.64]There we go.
[157:16.00]Get out of the way so I can move, man.
[157:25.75]Let's play foosball for an hour.
[157:37.13]What does it say?
[157:39.08]Destroy.
[157:41.38]Hit.
[157:42.80]Arrow pointing that way.
[157:47.66]Checking to see if there's any items.
[157:55.32]Sick!
[158:01.01]Was that an ironic sick?
[158:03.89]Sick!
[158:08.79]What is the point of the response button?
[158:11.77]Is interaction for the sake of interaction?
[158:14.29]It's just meaningless.
[158:16.84]All those things that I could be saying with X. You could just have him say it.
[158:27.25]Still got my champagne.
[158:29.93]We'll stick with the champagne for now.
[158:33.07]That door doesn't open.
[158:34.76]Climb through.
[158:35.68]I'm gonna get ambushed right here.
[158:43.81]Yeah, cold storage.
[158:47.41]My own personal chill chamber.
[158:55.02]Are we in the same place in the first game?
[158:57.24]Remember the chef, the weird lunch lady that was hacking somebody up here?
[159:00.60]This is the same exact place.
[159:14.31]What's his condition?
[159:21.46]He's alive.
[159:21.84]I saw him blink.
[159:23.66]He's still alive, but cut off pretty badly.
[159:25.56]Okay.
[159:27.26]While the list of names now makes sense, it's a list of SKX's targets.
[159:32.43]The magic man, whoever he is, must be next.
[159:37.71]SKX is studying me.
[159:40.63]Same as he did with the others.
[159:46.76]Okay.
[159:48.11]How do I get you out?
[159:55.09]How do I cut you?
[159:56.17]Grab something sharp to cut the straps.
[160:05.13]Oh, wait.
[160:05.69]What was that noise?
[160:10.41]What?
[160:10.79]It was somebody over there.
[160:11.77]It was somebody underneath.
[160:14.89]There's somebody underneath the fucking lunch lady.
[160:17.07]That should do it.
[160:29.64]Get it.
[160:29.92]Quickly now.
[160:30.46]All right, come on.
[160:36.18]Grab.
[160:36.60]SKX is delusional and psychotic, just like his test subjects.
[160:41.34]Let's move cautiously.
[160:44.92]This guy's so dead.
[160:47.77]Just wait for the bear to run from right to left.
[160:50.35]And tackle him into a wall.
[160:56.59]So, uh... Read any good books?
[161:04.30]Does he fight too?
[161:05.78]He probably just waits until I complete an area.
[161:14.11]Where the fuck are you people?
[161:21.38]Thankfully they fight each other too.
[161:25.08]Holding a bottle.
[161:31.96]God.
[161:35.28]I hear you, I heard you.
[161:38.44]No, you're not a freak.
[161:39.82]You're just a guy.
[161:52.84]Why does it play that song?
[162:02.75]That, like... This is an escort mission.
[162:12.20]Every 50 feet, he stays behind and you fight a room full of enemies.
[162:17.36]Played this before.
[162:18.18]You gonna grab that conduit and fight?
[162:22.90]Yep, I told you.
[162:24.04]See, they're in the corner.
[162:27.07]Fight the room of enemies, and then Bill will come down the hall.
[162:31.05]His name's Lord... Mayor.
[162:40.54]That happened so fast.
[162:42.10]Yikes!
[162:47.74]I could use some health.
[162:51.59]So I'm not entirely sure I'm gonna find it.
[162:55.45]Hopefully you're waiting patiently.
[163:14.09]I'm off!
[163:16.97]Oh come on, I lost a weapon?
[163:24.70]And stay down!
[163:25.56]That was so lame, what I just said right there.
[163:31.24]And stay down!
[163:34.76]Hair flip!
[163:38.56]This looks very dangerous.
[163:43.60]This is what somebody's front lawn looks like after Halloween.
[163:55.88]Oh god.
[164:02.60]You're gonna put me into the arena?
[164:04.58]You guys are not even going for the toilet!
[164:11.02]Have you ever been in a brawl before?
[164:12.36]What else we got?
[164:17.64]Meat?
[164:18.92]Electric fence?
[164:23.65]In the toilet.
[164:24.17]I thought there was a shit log in the toilet.
[164:26.40]It really did look like it.
[164:28.84]He didn't.
[164:29.30]Did he get it?
[164:30.08]No, he didn't.
[164:30.42]Whatever.
[164:31.82]Oh, my God.
[164:34.76]They're lowering the cage.
[164:45.51]No, he's gonna die.
[164:51.80]Can we please mod this to be the next Rumble?
[164:55.12]If that were possible, I would love to do that.
[165:03.25]Please move.
[165:04.95]Not one of these scenarios again.
[165:13.28]It really was just boo.
[165:14.46]That was big boo.
[165:16.38]I've made that reference before a bunch of times in games, but holy shit if that wasn't exactly what I was talking about.
[165:21.90]That's big fucking boo.
[165:29.43]Electric fence.
[165:32.33]Of course.
[165:32.99]Huh?
[165:37.59]What the fuck did I just do to that guy?
[165:45.11]Did I push him onto the rod?
[165:46.63]I think I did.
[165:54.50]And the skull.
[165:55.20]Fuck.
[165:57.20]How do I do the nut- kick?
[166:22.18]Get me out of here.
[166:26.83]I can't leave, really.
[166:29.49]Don't do it!
[166:30.13]Of course it's the fucking girl.
[166:39.92]With the fire.
[166:51.19]Somebody else down here Oh my god you fucking asshole game
[167:19.54]I'm getting stepped on.
[167:21.36]This guy's stepping on my head.
[167:46.82]Like, I understand the need for cool shit like particle effects and stuff, but man, if it makes your game run at eight fucking frames a second, turn it off!
[167:55.25]It's fucking useless here.
[167:58.39]Oh, I'm so unreasonably angry at this.
[168:02.81]Now restart it again.
[168:04.45]This is fucking dumb.
[168:14.88]8 FPS was top of the line in 2005.
[168:16.92]Fucking eat shit.
[168:25.07]You dumb guys.
[168:32.83]Double Collat.
[168:35.02]Make it fucking happen.
[168:36.02]No quick time event bullshit.
[168:38.16]Throw that shit in the garbage can.
[168:41.20]I don't want to do it ever again.
[168:44.36]Doesn't work half the time.
[168:58.09]Oh my god.
[169:04.83]Oh, this is frustrating.
[169:09.18]Fucking first game was not frustrating.
[169:12.68]It was fun.
[169:15.66]Get in the fucking meat grinder.
[169:18.18]Turn it on.
[169:19.02]Turn it on!
[169:19.58]Get me out of here, please.
[169:44.25]God.
[169:59.91]Just turn off the electricity monolith.
[170:02.51]You don't need to have electricity everywhere.
[170:05.59]It's so unnecessary.
[170:09.20]Are you scared of me or what?
[170:12.76]I'm not sure.
[170:37.71]Disgusting creatures wouldn't you agree?
[170:53.22]Mr. Thomas?
[170:55.24]Oh Did you turn off the fucking electricity the two-faced rat himself?
[170:58.77]Oh
[170:59.57]You still haven't grasped the situation, have you?
[171:02.23]Feral's your executioner.
[171:04.14]He's not worthy of your loyalty.
[171:06.42]Don't do this, Dorland.
[171:08.38]He belongs with us.
[171:10.64]You're a fool if you don't see that.
[171:14.88]When did the SCU employ murderers?
[171:17.63]I take orders from the Oro, and so should he.
[171:21.59]Isn't that right?
[171:27.46]Ew.
[171:28.93]His first major decision.
[171:32.41]Alright, so here's my chance.
[171:36.45]So, is there a brick?
[171:38.17]I'm gonna throw the brick up at the guy with the gun.
[171:45.48]He's gonna do it for me.
[172:08.84]Did I scream and I blew his head up?
[172:11.74]I just force power exploded his brain.
[172:19.59]I'm back!
[172:36.95]I'm so confused.
[172:44.96]Well, that was ear to ear.
[172:51.62]That's in me!
[172:52.24]I'm dead!
[172:53.18]That knife is in my fucking throat!
[172:54.44]He's killed me already!
[172:57.84]That's a deep cut.
[172:59.31]I'm not recovering from that one.
[173:01.75]Holy shit.
[173:03.21]That's inside.
[173:04.73]You die as this guy and you play as the serial killer.
[173:25.10]Dorland's agents are gathering everyone up for questioning.
[173:27.22]They're looking for you.
[173:29.44]Rosa, listen to me.
[173:30.66]The Magic Man.
[173:32.08]I know that name.
[173:33.38]A real tricky son of a bitch.
[173:34.81]Hangs out at Svensson's Magic Theater.
[173:36.87]Have you heard of it?
[173:37.67]We get to go to the Magic Theater?
[173:38.69]Yeah, I think so.
[173:40.39]Meet me there as soon as you can.
[173:41.97]And make sure you're not followed.
[173:45.34]Boy, I feel like this could really redeem so that we like we peaked up with the bear and then like 12 FPS electricity cage dropped it down like like if it's a stock, you know, there's your like pump there and it dropped I Feel like the magician's theater could bring us up for like a nice little correction.
[174:06.25]You know, I mean I Have more health
[174:19.45]This could really put us into a big bull market if we get to the magician theater.
[174:25.79]Drink.
[174:27.04]It's what you do.
[174:28.74]It's who you are.
[174:30.86]Shut up.
[174:31.44]12 FPS electricity world had an exploding head in it.
[174:37.68]That's true.
[174:46.02]Give in.
[174:52.95]This is me Like duh That's just me talking
[175:23.60]We're getting close.
[175:26.94]We've got maybe another... Another one or two chapters here.
[175:31.13]Defeat alcohol demon.
[175:35.73]Well, I just... That pushed it forward a little bit longer because I just drank like a full bottle of alcohol.
[175:44.90]This is the alcohol demon.
[175:57.75]The whole game is just a light.
[176:02.94]This is me fighting my demons.
[176:04.30]Oh my lord.
[176:07.00]Defeat your alcohol demon.
[176:12.70]Did you turn off the filter?
[176:13.50]Yeah, that's the joke here.
[176:24.59]That shit's been off.
[176:25.51]It feels like it wasn't turned off.
[176:26.71]Oh shit, another alcohol demon!
[176:28.69]Okay.
[176:29.07]Search the magic theater.
[176:30.15]There's a lot of potential here.
[176:31.57]Pick up the Szechwan.
[176:32.43]I'm not gonna say the rest.
[176:33.41]Oh boy.
[177:01.81]House of Illusion.
[177:11.14]I don't know.
[177:13.70]You are going to come off of here.
[177:15.18]Yeah, these weird assistant magician people.
[177:20.24]Next.
[177:28.69]It looks like I'm going to have to time walking through here.
[177:33.63]Or am I?
[177:37.86]Was that just... I just had to wait it out and the door just opened?
[177:44.84]Alright.
[177:45.14]It was just to wait a certain amount of time.
[177:48.90]And then turn the power on.
[177:51.63]Oh, shit.
[177:53.33]I've updated your fuel kit.
[177:58.47]Yeah, it is going to be a literal funhouse.
[177:59.53]It's just Bioshock.
[177:59.99]A lot of these places do remind me of Rapture.
[178:01.29]The enemies, too.
[178:02.05]They're just psychos.
[178:03.82]She's just alone down there.
[178:27.92]She's not scared to be there alone?
[178:32.26]I'm scared to be here alone.
[178:33.52]Smash that.
[178:44.09]Uh, well.
[178:46.41]Do I have to press the button again?
[178:47.63]Is it a safe?
[178:53.08]No.
[178:56.16]Can't do anything with this gray.
[178:57.04]I think I just have to spin it around again.
[178:58.96]Because I can't go anywhere.
[179:04.85]Sawing somebody in half.
[179:07.55]Can't climb up on a table, right?
[179:26.09]Literally a thousand IQ.
[179:27.73]What are you talking about?
[179:32.37]This thing was all right This thing seriously was here.
[179:35.97]I thought this was a fucking cane I I had a cane already.
[179:40.43]I didn't want to take a second cane Look I want okay.
[179:44.89]I want you to look look at look at my pareff right here ready to take a look at your pareff Imagine you're looking straight
[179:51.29]This is a- Every- Everything's a melee weapon.
[179:53.29]That's a fucking cane I don't want.
[179:54.79]I already own one.
[180:01.66]Do I have to jump through this?
[180:02.80]Alright, here we go.
[180:16.63]It's like trying to run for it.
[180:18.39]I think I have to stop it.
[180:21.32]I have to stop it at the right time.
[180:27.39]Or is there another lever to push?
[180:32.65]Should I just go back upstairs?
[180:43.41]Crouch?
[180:44.07]There is no crouch button.
[180:46.33]And now I lost my cane.
[180:48.27]Wish it was a fucking cane.
[180:51.41]Guys, there's no crouch button!
[180:53.53]There's no jump, there's no crouch, there's only walk and run.
[180:56.79]I'm sick and angry we stopped breaking things in this room.
[181:19.78]Oh, a shovel!
[181:21.08]Maybe I can wedge it in there.
[181:44.33]I tried to do this!
[181:45.71]I came in here and tried to fucking press this button and there was no prompt and it didn't work.
[181:53.01]Ay.
[181:54.09]Ay.
[181:55.43]Ay, caramba.
[181:59.31]Look, then her face moves.
[182:03.75]I knew you were gonna get off that fucking wheel of death.
[182:09.94]There's one behind me.
[182:12.10]Fucking die.
[182:16.20]What were you saying?
[182:17.16]Were you talking?
[182:18.28]Not anymore.
[182:19.44]Get out of my way.
[182:21.56]Oh look, another one.
[182:22.36]Hmm.
[182:24.44]That hurt.
[182:25.04]Okay, that hurt her.
[182:26.65]Her AI didn't load yet.
[182:27.63]We gotta kill her before that happens.
[182:30.73]Where is it?
[182:31.45]Here it came.
[182:33.83]Right in the fucking head.
[182:38.55]Not dead yet.
[182:42.70]I broke every one of her teeth.
[182:46.15]Alright, well, she's not gonna come out, apparently.
[182:54.61]I missed her again.
[182:56.97]I'm gonna get collapsed on.
[183:17.29]All right, so now now I can't go through this yet.
[183:28.49]I need to stop another device We have to go back down And go press another lever I think
[183:46.54]If I'm... I've... I've... Who knows?
[183:51.02]We're in the magic funhouse.
[183:53.86]This time I'm gonna find a lever.
[183:55.53]I'm not gonna let everybody scream at me and say, you're a fucking idiot.
[183:58.87]Look, now I agree with you.
[184:00.13]Pick up the fire axe, pull the lever.
[184:02.49]We locked it in.
[184:11.48]Oh, it's safe.
[184:16.67]Everybody's gonna make fun of me.
[184:21.25]No prompt?
[184:23.23]No prompt!
[184:25.00]You gotta press your face into it like you're watching a TV as a four-year-old.
[184:36.66]Alright, doctor.
[184:38.44]Hello, Ticketmaster.
[184:40.19]What's new?
[184:41.49]Put the sword in.
[184:42.39]If I put the sword in, he dies.
[184:44.11]So I need to get ready to kill him first before this happens.
[184:46.17]Because this is just mean and cruel.
[184:47.53]So we're going to take his head clean off.
[184:52.62]I think I can get it through the gate.
[184:55.70]Kill him.
[184:56.46]Who cares?
[184:56.84]Oh, there's more.
[185:02.42]Alright, well, this is just the way it works.
[185:06.62]This is the only way, guys.
[185:28.43]Alright, well, I guess that, uh, I guess there was a little more to that than what meets the naked eye there.
[185:36.31]Alright, um, I get it.
[185:40.20]I think I get it.
[185:41.36]Oh no, don't tell me I do get it.
[185:43.02]Do I get it?
[185:43.60]I do get it.
[185:44.46]You gotta hold one and spin it around because the green to the blue to the red matches everything.
[185:50.24]So when I put this sword in here, it's locking this one in place, I think.
[185:57.81]I'm gonna have to get out, I think.
[185:59.15]Ready, set, go.
[186:00.35]No, that ain't it.
[186:01.17]That's not it.
[186:10.40]No, there are... Guys, there were just monsters here now.
[186:13.56]No, alright, listen, listen.
[186:16.44]They just spawned monsters that you're impossible to see.
[186:19.90]And you gotta kill them.
[186:23.40]Okay.
[186:25.33]I do not get it.
[186:27.33]I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.
[186:31.77]Just murder this guy.
[186:33.15]And then watch out for the screen to turn orange.
[186:36.28]And then fight the enemies.
[186:38.06]In fact, I'm just gonna do this.
[186:40.64]I got one.
[186:42.06]Got two.
[186:42.38]Having fun yet?
[186:55.38]Hey, having fun yet?
[187:02.42]I don't talk to him, do I?
[187:05.04]He's just calling me a motherfucker?
[187:09.38]Are you a motherfucker?
[187:11.40]What a wrong reaction.
[187:12.08]Oh my god.
[187:26.81]That's great.
[187:27.19]It's the worst Sonic they ever made.
[187:28.89]They tried to go back to 2D.
[187:30.05]And everybody still gave it a 6 out of 10.
[187:41.95]This is followed by hallucinatory episodes that slip quickly into psychosis and other forms of uncontrolled violent behavior.
[187:49.04]It goes on to say, people with natural tendencies to be violent become even more so when exposed to these sonic emissions.
[187:55.88]Ethan, the implications of this are huge.
[188:02.72]Are you suggesting this organization is responsible for all that's wrong in the city?
[188:06.55]Yes.
[188:12.66]I'll get a good out of that one.
[188:13.36]I kind of like this phone.
[188:13.92]I like that up and down arrow with the select button in the middle.
[188:17.15]You have the separate analog on the top left.
[188:21.13]I don't like the iPhone X. They got rid of all the buttons.
[188:24.47]I'm a button kind of guy.
[188:39.72]Screens are irresponsible.
[188:41.44]They're not responsive.
[188:44.34]I'm a button person.
[188:45.10]I like to press the button.
[188:46.04]I'm going down a hole I don't want to go down.
[188:51.65]How do you spell it?
[188:52.51]Good detective work.
[189:05.70]higher than normal bone density unique vocal cords can create when trained complex sounds that reverberate through the sternum and chest cavity like a finely tuned instrument now get this various metal apparatuses surgically implanted also the iphone x has the face scan to get your iphone open it scans your face
[189:33.08]What actor is this?
[189:36.23]I've heard this guy a thousand times.
[189:38.99]Let's get some Rugrats.
[189:42.57]Which dad on Rugrats was this?
[189:48.30]I don't know.
[189:48.60]That's a Rugrat dad.
[189:56.34]Like a bird, you are drawn to me.
[189:58.44]And like a bird, you find retreat impossible.
[190:02.76]I'm not here to play your fucked up games, Magic Man.
[190:06.04]No.
[190:07.74]No, not like a bird.
[190:09.62]Not like those other helpless people running about in the city.
[190:11.96]Not Stew Pickles.
[190:12.36]Who was the other one?
[190:13.56]Drew Pickles.
[190:14.46]Enough babbling.
[190:15.62]Come out so I can see you.
[190:16.64]Thank you.
[190:17.94]You're not so easily influenced.
[190:21.21]This is real pickles.
[190:25.68]More magic now.
[190:28.56]Whoever you care about.
[190:30.96]Alright, anyways, what I was going to say is the iPhone X has the face recognition device.
[190:39.52]Which, that sounds great, right?
[190:41.81]But what's to stop somebody from... Let's say one of you guys stole my iPhone.
[190:46.13]I was at PAX.
[190:47.07]You ran up to me and you just grabbed it out of my hand and sprinted away.
[190:50.54]Couldn't you just go to print out a picture of my face smiling?
[190:55.38]And scan it?
[190:57.93]You would just print out... I have hundreds of images of my face on the internet.
[191:02.17]You would just get them all.
[191:03.59]And find out which one works.
[191:06.49]She's ducked.
[191:11.82]This one ain't that bright.
[191:14.56]That's good.
[191:18.08]Pull the lever.
[191:19.78]We do have a spike death trap here.
[191:26.44]Is that the... There's the magician.
[191:38.62]Oh.
[191:40.62]Come on!
[191:42.12]Really?
[191:49.32]That's all it takes for him to disappear.
[191:51.54]Now where is he playing the music from?
[191:56.54]This show sucks!
[192:12.43]Tada!
[192:14.57]Where's he now?
[192:17.84]There we go.
[192:18.32]Do I have to fight the Magician?
[192:31.01]Toad Lover again.
[192:31.63]Oh god.
[192:33.71]I'm gonna die here.
[192:49.71]No, I get it.
[192:50.37]I don't get it.
[192:52.09]I have to make him fall down or something.
[192:59.43]Where is he now?
[193:06.37]Oh, hold on one sec.
[193:10.25]Did I lose connection to chat?
[193:14.71]Am I still streaming?
[193:21.21]Hold on.
[193:26.87]I think Twitch is dying.
[193:29.47]I need to reload it.
[193:33.29]Hold on.
[193:40.64]I lost connection to chat.
[193:48.24]I was wondering why I didn't see any... Nobody was chatting.
[193:51.16]I thought everyone was just silent because I was so terrible.
[193:55.42]I was never streaming.
[193:56.18]Twitch has been dying.
[193:56.99]Yeah, okay.
[193:59.53]I can see you guys now.
[194:01.03]I can read your messages now.
[194:08.66]Alright, so.
[194:11.02]Spike's here.
[194:12.14]I gotta turn something on.
[194:13.64]There's a gong machine.
[194:15.30]He says ta-da a bunch of times.
[194:16.72]I gotta turn on the light fires.
[194:19.26]Do I like to put out the fires?
[194:21.80]Does he eventually come up there?
[194:40.26]Did he stand up there?
[194:45.24]Oh my god.
[194:55.53]Okay, are you up top now?
[194:57.25]Can I drop you on the spikes?
[194:59.65]There he is.
[195:03.03]Went right over his shoulder.
[195:05.66]Oh, you fucking wanker.
[195:08.66]Oh my god, it went as close to his shoulder as it could go.
[195:22.15]What the fuck?
[195:44.74]The underground is abuzz, Mr. Thomas.
[195:48.19]How do you know who I am?
[195:51.33]Give me a break.
[195:51.97]Right when that fight started, Twitch died.
[195:56.83]Remendium, the remedy, was supposed to be a myth, a bedtime story.
[196:01.75]But now, you've made them think otherwise.
[196:06.39]You can all go to hell.
[196:09.21]Wait!
[196:10.43]Please!
[196:11.57]It's a gift!
[196:15.15]What was the point of this boss?
[196:18.55]What was the point of this game?
[196:20.41]They made a bunch of cartoon characters.
[196:21.65]Not anymore.
[196:45.50]I can tell you they are on the verge of suffocating this city.
[196:50.64]What?
[196:52.68]Let's just say big brother is all grown up and hungry for power.
[196:59.74]Where can I find them?
[197:02.44]You don't know what you're asking.
[197:05.25]There's at least three moments in this game that I would say were great.
[197:10.17]And I feel like that's enough.
[197:13.91]If you can go back and remember three really cool parts of a game, it's probably worth you playing.
[197:25.22]There was a trick.
[197:30.40]Fucked up?
[197:39.96]Alright, gun efficiency.
[197:40.74]Gives you increased firearm accuracy as well as an ammo check speed.
[197:46.92]Okay.
[197:48.64]Oh, fuck that.
[197:49.30]Ugh.
[197:49.46]Hmm.
[197:50.46]Aren't we the police?
[197:51.86]How do you call the police?
[197:54.21]Your phone's gonna ring.
[198:10.39]You're gonna dial it and all of a sudden your cell phone's gonna ring.
[198:13.29]With your terrible shit ringtone.
[198:15.27]That is the default fucking ringtone.
[198:18.95]Change it.
[198:19.69]For Christ's sake.
[198:20.45]What's my ringtone?
[198:26.55]Let's find out.
[198:30.92]Let's put my money where my mouth is here.
[198:34.28]Am I talking shit for no reason?
[198:35.40]What's my ringtone?
[198:43.78]Hope I'm not making myself out to be a fool here.
[198:47.16]Ringtone.
[198:47.70]What is it?
[198:50.98]That's pretty good.
[198:55.18]Mm-hmm.
[198:57.82]What about this one?
[199:01.83]Yeah.
[199:02.21]Get the fuck out of here.
[199:04.13]Don't have this.
[199:05.77]You know why you don't have this?
[199:07.85]Because every single time you're on a train, you're in an airport, you're in fucking line at Burger King, you're going to hear this noise and go, oh, is that me?
[199:18.28]Is that me?
[199:18.70]Who's there?
[199:19.54]Is that me?
[199:20.58]It's not you.
[199:21.32]It's the person fucking standing in line getting their fucking chicken McNuggets in front of you.
[199:25.40]Take this off.
[199:26.94]Make it this.
[199:29.05]Nobody has this terrible fucking ringtone.
[199:30.79]This one's the worst.
[199:32.41]Make sure you have one that nobody else has.
[199:41.62]What happened to the game?
[199:47.24]I had a minute to respond there, and apparently it just didn't do it.
[199:52.88]Pop that.
[199:54.13]Oh, there you go.
[200:09.68]Yours is the Tim Allen grunt.
[200:11.20]That's perfect.
[200:11.96]Spectrum.
[200:14.10]Find something.
[200:15.06]Over here.
[200:15.61]Up.
[200:15.77]Down.
[200:15.97]Left.
[200:16.39]Right.
[200:16.59]B, A, start.
[200:16.93]You know what I'm saying?
[200:40.05]Did it work?
[200:40.83]Why did it not work?
[200:42.19]Did it?
[200:42.41]Oh my fucking god.
[200:45.25]Now I look like an asshole.
[200:47.37]Now I just totally look like a dickhead.
[200:52.19]If it was a YouTube video, that would look like an idiot.
[201:01.94]Why are these not playing?
[201:11.25]A laugh track was supposed to just play right there.
[201:13.15]But apparently, like, I don't have any audio on my actual computer.
[201:20.65]Okay.
[201:22.83]Well.
[201:26.87]My desktop audio source does not work.
[201:30.79]Somehow.
[201:34.43]Okay.
[201:41.00]Completely unsolicited laugh track to the left right left right BA star Konami joke.
[201:46.27]The Konami code.
[201:48.81]If anybody unironically says the Konami code, don't trust them.
[201:55.97]They're not to be trusted.
[202:04.94]He's gonna chase it.
[202:10.03]I can't even get a laugh track to laugh at my joke.
[202:12.81]There's more animals here.
[202:19.92]Why am I going so fast?
[202:29.68]For those of you that have been on... They gave me my favorite item.
[202:36.75]There's no reason for this to be down here.
[202:39.55]They knew that this is the best item, that I love it.
[202:42.65]Why else would I be here?
[202:45.97]That's so perfect.
[202:48.43]Oh, well, every time... I hate when it freezes like that when it saves.
[203:05.58]Still have not been hit once with the Locker.
[203:07.72]In case you're keeping track.
[203:10.74]Just in case you keep the score.
[203:14.22]Not one point of damage since getting the Locker effect.
[203:17.31]What the hell was that?
[203:26.73]Alright.
[203:30.43]Well, yep.
[203:31.55]This guy's new.
[203:38.49]Broke the locker.
[203:39.61]Now I have to take damage.
[203:40.75]We can't fight.
[203:43.60]I gotta pull a wall out of them.
[203:44.70]I gotta pull a... I gotta pull a hair out of the wall.
[203:49.74]Stupid piano music.
[204:12.31]Let's get a new hair.
[204:15.51]That guy was blocking our path, so we can now move, which is good.
[204:18.71]I have a good thing.
[204:21.88]Ladder.
[204:26.02]Ah.
[204:26.94]Don't dare.
[204:28.12]Where is he?
[204:29.24]I don't need him.
[204:37.71]To the ladder.
[204:38.55]Where was it?
[204:39.07]It was over here, right?
[204:40.39]Somewhere.
[204:40.87]No.
[204:42.37]Where?
[204:42.95]I'm just getting so turned around.
[204:44.95]I was going the right way, but then I decided to turn around and walk the other direction.
[204:49.79]What a dingo.
[205:01.50]Nice.
[205:01.66]Scrawny ones.
[205:03.02]Enemies?
[205:12.10]Barge.
[205:12.60]Call it a barge, man.
[205:14.36]Barge.
[205:14.74]No, it's a fucking barge.
[205:15.62]You know how many dock workers I've come across?
[205:21.20]They don't say barge.
[205:21.98]They say fucking barge.
[205:23.46]Yeah.
[205:26.35]Yoink, yoink.
[205:27.03]We gotta go this way.
[205:31.71]Don't.
[205:32.23]Don't.
[205:44.41]I have to fit down here?
[206:06.51]Do you remember the dock worker?
[206:07.45]Yeah, I used to pick up... If you work at a dock, it's just really heavy boxes that you bend over.
[206:13.78]You know what I'm saying?
[206:15.40]You bend down.
[206:17.00]I'll show you.
[206:17.48]Like here.
[206:18.44]This is important for you guys to understand.
[206:21.93]Give me one sec.
[206:42.04]So... I mean, I'm in, like, pajamas, so, like, you guys are gonna have to deal with it, but... So, anyways.
[206:49.50]When you work at a dock, you have to pick up with both hands.
[206:54.64]You get down, so, like, you've got a box like this, right?
[206:57.29]It's really heavy.
[206:58.09]You've got to, like, go down, use your back, like, and lift it up really heavily...
[207:04.90]And then it's just, it's simply, like, there's gonna be a ton of other shit, like, over here.
[207:08.74]There's gonna be, like, this is where the boxes go, and there's probably fish in here.
[207:13.45]And you just wanna fucking get it over here, you know what I mean?
[207:17.23]That's what you do for 12 hours.
[207:22.26]And then you go home.
[207:27.50]It's tough fucking work, I've done it before.
[207:39.07]It's not easy.
[207:45.39]Another TV down here?
[207:50.31]No, that's just a shoebox.
[207:52.06]No, that's... what is this?
[207:52.80]What is that?
[207:54.98]Is that a computer?
[207:57.76]Nice.
[208:09.06]I've, like, lost the thought process here.
[208:11.18]Am I this way?
[208:14.28]That's how I met him.
[208:16.43]Yeah, you met me on the dock.
[208:17.39]We were fucking throwing fish boxes.
[208:21.85]And the whole time you're doing it, you have to just talk shit about somebody.
[208:26.79]Think about me doing that over and over again.
[208:31.25]Why am I... Do I really have to fight the juggernaut right now?
[208:35.63]It says run for your life.
[208:36.81]All right.
[208:42.02]Uh, how do I get this open?
[208:50.25]Um... Can I climb this?
[208:54.61]Oh, I can go this way.
[208:57.77]No, I can't.
[208:59.19]I'm stuck.
[208:59.49]Here we go.
[209:02.67]And then... And then what?
[209:04.83]And then what?
[209:05.41]And then what?
[209:05.91]That.
[209:13.36]If you're working at the dock like that, and you're working your ass off, and, like, respect to those fucking people, but you have to talk a bunch of shit about, like, the Red Sox.
[209:22.35]And, like, who got traded?
[209:24.93]So, if you ever are working at, like, a dock, lifting a big box to fish and shit, and you're in, like, whatever area you're from, he's still here.
[209:35.64]Better.
[209:36.62]At least just pretend like you know what they're talking about.
[209:38.54]When they're like, yeah, I can't, you know, when Mookie Betts is going down to the minor leagues, just be like, yeah, fucking Mookie Betts.
[209:45.18]Just like repeat what he says, but say yeah in front of him.
[209:48.62]So let's, for example.
[209:52.70]Can you fucking believe that Mookie Betts is gonna go down to the minor leagues?
[209:58.00]Yeah.
[209:59.14]I can't fucking believe he's going to the minor leagues next week?
[210:01.77]Something like that I heard?
[210:02.93]Yeah.
[210:04.41]Easy.
[210:08.15]Let me tell you something, Tom Brady, Tom Brady ain't going anywhere.
[210:12.07]He's not retiring next year.
[210:13.53]Yeah, Tom Brady ain't going anywhere.
[210:17.49]He's the best quarterback to ever live.
[210:20.29]Just say yeah.
[210:21.77]Wait, is he throwing a picket?
[210:27.64]How many large things did he throw over here?
[210:31.58]Speaking of dock workers.
[210:33.12]Hey, let me tell you about Tom Brady.
[210:39.20]He's just doing the job.
[210:41.78]Let me tell you something.
[210:42.94]Fucking Mookie Betch is not going to those fucking vinyl leagues.
[210:46.16]You know what I'm saying?
[211:01.14]Why is the thing we're saying happening on the screen?
[211:05.08]Why?
[211:07.86]He ran out of boxes.
[211:08.87]Time to go home, man.
[211:09.79]Time to go back to your wife.
[211:17.53]What was I doing?
[211:18.23]What am I doing here?
[211:23.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[211:24.36]I actually have to go through everything.
[211:27.36]More respect for this guy.
[211:31.22]No, don't climb back down.
[211:33.57]Stay up here.
[211:34.59]I want to go around.
[211:39.48]I didn't even have a chance.
[211:41.82]Once I saw him picking up heavy box type things and throwing them over here, it was over.
[211:47.50]It was just over.
[211:51.52]Now what do I do?
[211:52.04]Open the door?
[211:52.54]I don't think I want to go down there.
[212:02.68]Where is he?
[212:03.76]One shot crossbow.
[212:12.35]This guy's just causing damage.
[212:13.67]Where do I go?
[212:16.98]I don't think I want to go down to the explosion.
[212:18.54]Fucking Mookie Betts is, like, not even that good.
[212:23.42]Ah.
[212:31.39]I can't fucking believe that.
[212:34.37]That entire chain of events just made no sense how that worked together.
[212:38.99]What the fuck, man?
[212:40.31]Now what am I doing?
[212:41.31]Okay, back up here.
[212:46.02]Activated.
[212:51.00]Going to the bus.
[212:54.25]Watch out for the dock worker.
[213:01.87]He still hit me in the fucking head.
[213:04.59]Jump to bus.
[213:08.39]Did he hit me again?
[213:10.96]He did, didn't he?
[213:14.00]You have fucking aim like I've never seen.
[213:16.72]Hold on, what about like down here?
[213:25.71]Will he hit me down here?
[213:26.93]I can't cross.
[213:28.85]He ran out of boxes.
[213:31.08]No he didn't.
[213:33.96]Alright, now I gotta give him the crossbow.
[213:38.14]Exit the vehicle.
[213:40.77]Now what do I do here?
[213:44.79]This way.
[213:49.53]Mookie Betts is real?
[213:50.53]Yeah, yes he is.
[213:51.61]What do you mean Mookie Betts is real?
[213:57.41]He plays on the Red Sox.
[213:59.17]He's a Red Sox player.
[214:10.41]I thought that was him breaking up.
[214:16.80]I thought that was the ground breaking.
[214:18.78]He was jumping through.
[214:19.54]This guy's going to get up.
[214:23.66]Where am I going?
[214:41.80]Oh, but she's getting chased!
[214:48.22]Okay.
[214:48.90]Dispose of metal junkies.
[214:52.75]And how would you... say I should do that?
[214:57.93]They're not all gonna stop throwing, are they?
[215:08.04]Are we gonna get to see dock workers?
[215:11.02]Actual, in reality, watch them throw shit.
[215:15.64]He can't make it up here, right?
[215:17.90]I don't think he can.
[215:19.56]He's desperately trying to figure out how.
[215:21.01]How am I supposed to kill these guys?
[215:24.11]Can I crawl through that?
[215:32.39]No.
[215:41.47]Is there a crane I can operate to drop on their heads?
[215:48.83]Or is he just going to give me pipe fitting?
[215:53.97]Operate a magnet.
[215:57.16]Do I have to scoop up these guys with a magnet?
[216:05.26]This is just playing the crane machine.
[216:11.53]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:12.93]Listen.
[216:13.30]Listen, dude.
[216:13.82]Listen.
[216:14.14]Don't.
[216:15.08]Don't.
[216:17.14]He can't hit me.
[216:20.26]He's gonna try his hardest.
[216:22.62]Oh, shit.
[216:26.30]Did he give up?
[216:28.98]I'm trying to activate the fucking magnet.
[216:30.64]It won't work.
[216:34.56]Get over here.
[216:35.96]Suck him up.
[216:36.60]UFO this guy.
[216:37.34]I need to drop him in here.
[216:47.15]You let him go, and you win the prize.
[216:49.57]Can you get out?
[216:56.73]Okay, no, no, no.
[217:03.01]This guy right here.
[217:09.75]Come here.
[217:10.84]Come here.
[217:14.20]Get... Why... You gotta get away from me.
[217:17.30]Go down there.
[217:18.19]This one guy is gonna be a real pain in the ass.
[217:21.97]That guy just heard a crash behind me.
[217:29.11]Get over here!
[217:30.49]Come here!
[217:30.87]I got him.
[217:37.92]He's just behind me, breaking stuff.
[217:42.04]No, no, no, no, don't hit me, please!
[217:45.70]Okay, I'm gonna have to get... Can I get the device over here in the corner?
[217:55.13]One more guy left.
[218:01.65]Ow!
[218:04.15]How do I get this guy to move?
[218:05.96]There it is.
[218:08.44]I'm gonna keep it right here and just get him when he walks by.
[218:10.00]Got it.
[218:14.01]The one guy that actually was doing anything to stop me.
[218:19.61]Sayonara.
[218:19.91]Oh, I was hoping I could get him right in the head.
[218:31.70]Meetup.
[218:35.74]Meetup in the cargo hold.
[218:38.98]Can I squeeze by?
[218:41.68]I can't.
[218:45.64]Drive shaft?
[218:51.41]I have such little health, don't!
[218:52.77]Oh shit.
[219:10.79]That's the noise that happens.
[219:11.87]That's the noise that you make when milk comes out of your nose.
[219:20.66]Only one, no.
[219:21.74]Get this thing out of here.
[219:22.70]I'm not taking one shot with a crossbow.
[219:27.51]Oh, this is, lock a gun?
[219:30.41]Thank God for help.
[219:34.05]Nothing else in here.
[219:36.55]Well, that was a necessary trip.
[219:47.77]It's me.
[219:50.65]So much noise.
[219:58.79]Investigate the sound.
[220:00.09]What if I don't want to?
[220:04.29]What if I want to just leave?
[220:05.45]This is gonna be another one of those metal junkies.
[220:15.91]It's gonna be a very large one.
[220:18.41]It's gonna be a weird boss fight.
[220:20.37]I'm gonna strangle another guy.
[220:22.88]I'm gonna put my hands around somebody else's neck.
[220:31.10]Not quite.
[220:34.66]What is my leg?
[220:40.91]Uh... Right.
[220:47.30]Do I have unlimited shots here?
[220:48.21]I don't even... I need to do this like a... Is somebody hitting me from somewhere?
[221:07.60]Is that guy up there?
[221:21.72]You wanna see how I have to do this?
[221:26.42]Watch.
[221:28.06]It's too, it's too impossible.
[221:30.57]I have to go like this.
[221:35.85]I have to hold the controller upside down to do this.
[221:40.78]No I, wait, no I don't, like this.
[221:49.94]I have to treat this like Street Fighter.
[221:58.31]It's hurting.
[222:00.55]It hurts to play like this.
[222:06.26]What is hitting me?
[222:07.62]Honest to God.
[222:08.32]Is somebody throwing rocks?
[222:09.90]This person.
[222:10.96]Look at how hard it is to hit this fucking person up there.
[222:15.62]Oh my god, how did they make this game this much more awful than the first one?
[222:30.10]Why can I not use my thumbs?
[222:32.12]Because it's... Ugh!
[222:45.59]Like it's already so low That didn't really help
[223:11.45]Physical.
[223:12.17]The physical pain to do what I'm doing right now with the Bright Analog stick.
[223:16.87]Once it's making you want to heal.
[223:24.80]Bright Analog and R1.
[223:28.28]Oh.
[223:29.84]Boy.
[223:38.20]Aim up- Oh my god!
[223:41.55]I hit this guy!
[223:45.01]I don't know- I want somebody to argue how this is not the worst thing ever.
[223:53.57]That's what you have to do.
[223:54.81]This.
[224:09.22]Not this.
[224:11.85]Not this.
[224:12.85]This!
[224:13.77]We're here.
[224:16.27]Stay still.
[224:16.79]You're losing a lot of blood.
[224:19.49]I need to get up.
[224:21.13]I need to keep moving.
[224:23.13]I don't think that's a good... GameStop.
[224:27.95]I'm playing it on PS3.
[224:30.21]Sure wish I could play this on PC.
[224:32.99]There is no PC version of this game.
[224:35.40]It's only on PS3.
[224:38.64]That's normal controller aiming?
[224:40.84]No, it ain't.
[224:41.36]It's usually R2 is shoot.
[224:44.00]It's like L1 to aim and like R2.
[224:46.36]It's usually R2 to shoot.
[224:47.60]Don't let them get to you.
[224:50.58]Not R1.
[225:00.09]It's never been R2.
[225:01.13]Yes, it has.
[225:08.97]It's... What?
[225:14.31]Has it been like more than 10 years since I've actually played a PlayStation 3 game where I don't know this?
[225:27.68]Xbox was R2.
[225:38.20]Maybe I'm remembering Xbox.
[225:39.52]I had an Xbox.
[225:40.42]I didn't have a PS3.
[225:42.36]I do know.
[225:44.54]It's been a long road, hasn't it?
[225:47.41]It's easy to do with left analog and R1.
[225:49.63]Right, but this is right analog and R1.
[225:52.45]I represent all your demons, Ethan.
[225:55.29]Alcohol was just one of them.
[225:58.02]Using right thumb and right index is just my... That's like playing a fucking violin for me.
[226:04.02]Why is the alcohol demon back?
[226:05.02]I'm not real.
[226:25.35]Did I beat the game?
[226:29.80]That jumpscare was like a mile away.
[226:54.33]This has got to be like the last five minutes of the game.
[226:59.88]I get inside of a tank.
[227:03.16]And I just go on like a rampage.
[227:07.55]Hahaha.
[227:20.22]So the story of this game is that Ethan is an amplifier that makes people kill each other.
[227:25.97]Voice attack.
[227:33.03]When did I get the banshee scream?
[227:34.11]Are you kidding me?
[227:57.13]A very powerful ability has awoken in you to initiate rapidly plus L1, R1 until a sonic blast is released.
[228:03.44]A short rest is needed.
[228:06.48]Did I do that?
[228:07.14]I think I just did that.
[228:10.26]I did.
[228:10.62]Why did I just Steve Urkel?
[228:13.36]Did I do that?
[228:14.16]Alright, let's blow this guy's head off.
[228:17.13]Where is he?
[228:20.79]No.
[228:21.51]Don't do it.
[228:23.48]Don't tell me that I have to follow the strings again.
[228:26.02]Don't you fucking dare.
[228:28.84]Don't you dare, Monolith.
[228:32.03]Don't you fucking dare.
[228:33.23]I'm gonna be so angry if I'm gonna have to follow the goddamn Easter egg strings again.
[228:38.71]I'm gonna.
[228:43.15]I'm gonna have to.
[228:56.77]I achieved in dying.
[229:00.05]Wait, what did that say?
[229:04.00]I just got a prompt.
[229:12.88]I want to do this to somebody.
[229:18.65]I actually do have to follow the easter egg strings.
[229:26.72]Overload all the oro devices.
[229:29.88]I have to scream at it, right?
[229:41.71]When I don't scream.
[229:48.57]That's not working.
[229:52.33]He's dragging... Isn't that an oro device?
[229:55.20]No?
[229:55.38]Okay, I have to grab this.
[229:57.54]Spin it around a bunch and rip it out.
[230:01.96]That's... that's over.
[230:02.70]Have to keep it in the red.
[230:21.64]More Easter egg hunts.
[230:24.79]What?
[230:25.11]Where were you?
[230:26.49]Where were you?
[230:27.07]I've had enough of your shit.
[230:35.82]Get Sonic boomed.
[230:53.14]That didn't work.
[230:55.31]Come on!
[230:59.95]I don't know how you're still alive after that, but whatever.
[231:20.47]Shoot him.
[231:21.63]Can you please shoot this guy?
[231:25.33]Shoot him.
[231:26.21]Shoot the gun.
[231:27.33]Shoot that gun.
[231:33.41]Got enough.
[231:34.53]Yep.
[231:35.09]Exploded.
[231:38.15]There was an explosion back there, but it didn't kill anybody.
[231:48.42]I blew up the... I actually did blow up the tank.
[232:01.48]There's the radio.
[232:02.50]Here's a gun.
[232:03.08]Assault rifle.
[232:06.15]Wait for the little freak to come up here.
[232:07.89]Yeah, there he is.
[232:14.53]I double killed him.
[232:16.45]You're absolutely dead.
[232:28.50]Oh my god.
[232:41.41]Slow motion fucking... Not gonna say it, because I'd be a broken record at this point.
[232:49.66]I'm not gonna say the thing that I was gonna say.
[232:52.95]Not gonna say it.
[232:55.25]But if you're curious for a number... Seven.
[233:00.16]Probably seven.
[233:01.84]If I could give you an actual number.
[233:42.39]Where am I why are we down here?
[233:48.63]Guys let just let him up
[234:08.47]Somebody just put an asteroid in?
[234:09.75]Yeah, put... Oh, it hurts.
[234:15.13]Seven.
[234:17.18]It hurts to play seven.
[234:20.52]Seven's not cool.
[234:23.06]If your game is seven, remake it.
[234:29.52]Fix it.
[234:30.88]Nobody wants to six.
[234:31.88]Nobody wants to six.
[234:44.45]The first game wasn't six!
[234:48.43]The first game wasn't seven!
[234:49.63]I ran at least... Don't say that, because that's you bringing it up!
[235:04.10]Get me out of here!
[235:05.16]Get me out of here!
[235:05.84]Why are we on the ground?
[235:07.52]Why did my voice do this?
[235:13.79]Just wait a few to finish.
[235:16.53]Where are your guns?
[235:21.59]Where are you guys going?
[235:25.36]How did you put down your guns?
[235:44.46]No, not again.
[235:45.74]No, not again.
[235:47.10]Not again.
[235:52.36]Why are we doing this a third time?
[235:54.06]Where are... No, don't do it again.
[235:58.95]Oh, okay.
[236:06.09]I'm pressing R1.
[236:07.07]I think you guys are... Some of you guys are not understanding that I am pressing R1.
[236:15.60]There's not enough frame data to accept my inputs.
[236:21.35]I can't die here.
[236:22.17]I have to do something about this.
[236:23.35]This guy, I have to do something.
[236:24.79]I have to do the exploding head thing.
[236:27.07]Shit, where is he?
[236:36.73]You have to mash R1.
[236:37.87]I was going like this.
[236:42.27]I was pressing it as much as as I don't fucking kill me.
[236:54.51]No, I don't keep forgetting to mash.
[236:56.39]I'm mashing, but when I press the button, I'm on a piece of frame data that doesn't exist.
[237:02.38]It's like Dark Souls.
[237:03.26]Remember in Dark Souls when you jumped?
[237:05.42]When I went to 60 FPS?
[237:06.28]That shit was all fucked up.
[237:23.10]Somebody fell asleep at the wheel with this game.
[237:27.73]They got a Ferrari with that first game.
[237:31.89]And then they fell asleep.
[237:34.23]The guy took it for like a test drive.
[237:38.50]And just went asleep.
[237:41.46]And he drove and ended up like on a snowy mountain.
[237:43.16]And he's like, you know, this would be good in the next game game.
[237:59.53]What I've heard cartoon noises
[238:26.20]Where are we now?
[238:28.16]Where are we now?
[238:28.86]We're in the bottom of a ship.
[238:41.05]Guess we're going down here.
[238:47.78]Follow the blue spaghetti.
[238:59.22]We're so close.
[239:10.76]At least I have full health.
[239:14.40]At least they're nice enough to do that for me.
[239:20.94]Did he die?
[239:23.90]No, come on.
[239:28.03]I'm just gonna run.
[239:29.15]This is R-E-A-L-D-U-M-B.
[239:43.80]We're invested.
[239:44.40]It has to be finished.
[239:52.00]Can I go under here?
[239:52.74]Can I crawl through this?
[240:01.55]Where's the device?
[240:18.65]Guess we gotta just walk up and around.
[240:20.61]I'm trying to follow the spaghetti and that's apparently a mistake.
[240:28.47]You scream.
[240:30.36]I don't have it, I guess.
[240:35.21]It's MASH L1 R1.
[240:38.49]Like, for some reason they added that to this game.
[240:41.97]For some strange reason, they wanted to add MASH R1 L1 to this game.
[241:02.59]Where's a locker when you need one?
[241:09.53]How many more of these are there?
[241:11.39]Did I have it back?
[241:19.36]This door open?
[241:22.44]No.
[241:23.78]This one does.
[241:26.76]Can we go back to Dinosaur Week?
[241:32.71]I lost a gun that I had before.
[241:34.13]Do you have a gun?
[242:02.61]I hear somebody shooting a gun.
[242:04.25]And it's not me.
[242:07.13]Is the helicopter shooting at me now?
[242:20.86]This is pain.
[242:26.34]This is just real pain.
[242:28.12]Please have this game be done after this level.
[242:30.77]I can't abandon it.
[242:31.90]I can't.
[242:32.34]As much as I want to just press the power button on my PlayStation 3 right now.
[242:53.27]I have resisting courage to hit the PlayStation 3 with a hammer.
[243:13.70]And I'm about to die.
[243:16.26]I have to do something.
[243:17.02]I feel like I'm supposed to do this thing, I think.
[243:19.27]I don't know.
[243:19.65]It's the helicopter shooting.
[243:25.81]I have to do something.
[243:26.29]I have to blow something.
[243:28.07]I'm going to try over here.
[243:31.20]I'm going to try every avenue.
[243:33.14]I'll have to put wood over here.
[243:52.70]This is open now.
[243:58.52]I'm not fucking around.
[243:59.46]I want out of here.
[244:01.10]I want out.
[244:03.60]I want out.
[244:04.22]Stop messing around.
[244:04.74]Stop making these fucking jokes.
[244:11.13]No pranks.
[244:11.87]No goofing around.
[244:13.53]No goofy shit.
[244:15.91]No Mickey Mouse bullshit.
[244:17.41]Aight.
[244:36.45]Why?
[244:36.77]It didn't work this time.
[244:37.93]It didn't work.
[244:38.78]Where am I?
[244:40.04]Where am I going?
[244:47.86]Where am I going?
[244:54.32]I don't know.
[245:01.88]What the hell is going on?
[245:04.12]Back.
[245:04.79]Don't.
[245:05.71]I'm dead.
[245:06.11]I'm dead here.
[245:39.67]Where's the helicopter?
[245:43.65]It's already gone.
[245:44.21]And the death door wasn't open.
[245:48.79]We're out of here.
[245:53.76]We just gotta run.
[246:06.39]It doesn't matter.
[246:16.37]Aim up!
[246:16.69]What does this game have for a rating?
[246:32.48]I'm actually curious.
[246:34.28]Somebody go do it.
[246:36.16]What does Condemned 1 have on like IGN?
[246:38.66]And what does this have on IGN?
[246:40.98]Because Condemned 1 was so fucking fantastic.
[246:47.09]It was fantastic.
[246:48.97]It was a fucking fantastic game.
[246:51.54]They both have A, that's a shame.
[247:14.05]Okay, that's an automatic gun.
[247:17.25]He's gonna hide in there.
[247:22.22]I need just to chill here and, like, hit the blocks and get the ammo.
[247:43.68]I'm not even sure where the fuck to go from here.
[247:47.22]I didn't even do that.
[247:48.30]The game did it for me.
[247:56.76]Condemned 1 was not like a run around and shoot.
[247:59.98]It's back.
[248:00.72]It's back.
[248:01.14]Just quiet, Jeremy.
[248:20.45]I did it.
[248:21.99]I did it.
[248:22.37]I killed the chopper.
[248:23.51]Let's do it three times.
[248:25.13]What?
[249:19.76]I'm just so done.
[249:20.88]You know what I mean?
[249:23.12]You know when you get to a point where you're just like, done.
[249:29.34]You just get done.
[249:31.58]I'm kind of there.
[249:33.08]That's what put the stake in my vampire heart.
[249:52.74]Yucky!
[249:53.44]Yucky!
[249:54.10]Yuck!
[249:55.86]Yuck!
[249:56.34]This is not worth beating.
[250:08.53]I'm just- I'm trying to understand how this fucking engine still makes any sense.
[250:14.95]Sometimes I shoot it and it explodes.
[250:18.26]But now it's gonna come back.
[250:21.30]It's gonna stay up here.
[250:25.91]And do it one more time.
[250:34.94]What's the trigger for the encounter?
[250:38.06]There's just a mothership above us.
[250:39.38]There's an even bigger helicopter.
[250:47.19]I think I do have to be down here.
[250:50.43]For this to come back.
[250:55.64]But how do I not get hit by the helicopter when I crash?
[251:15.57]Okay, here we go.
[251:16.33]Watch out.
[251:16.82]Out of the way.
[251:29.30]Are we done?
[251:31.80]How did you make it out of that?
[251:34.78]What is this thing?
[251:38.30]I have nothing.
[251:45.27]Give me the gun.
[251:46.07]Any bullets?
[251:47.01]That guy was inside the helicopter.
[252:20.91]Half of this game has been fucking awesome, and the other half has been like, drown me.
[252:35.44]So what does it get?
[252:35.96]A 50?
[252:37.81]Okay, what if 50% of the game has been, like, a 90?
[252:41.59]And 50% of the game has been, like, a 50?
[252:44.05]It's like a 75, right?
[252:45.31]A 70?
[252:45.37]It's gonna be the big turn.
[252:46.59]She's gonna... She was her all along.
[253:04.82]Don't even get on here.
[253:09.18]Don't even give him a chance to get on here.
[253:15.97]Yeah, I would say this is a 7 out of 10.
[253:20.51]And almost all of those reasons for it being a 7 are technical.
[253:25.24]Almost every single one.
[253:27.24]In fact, it is every single one.
[253:42.94]I swear to God I was pressing R1.
[253:45.08]You can even hear it.
[253:46.58]You can even hear me click it that first time.
[253:57.17]Head hit part two.
[254:10.47]I'm- that guy's head was a gong.
[254:11.87]Oh, I gotta get back on.
[254:24.59]I gotta get back- g-g-g-go, gotta get back on, gotta get back on!
[254:33.98]There's no weapons either, I need a weapon.
[254:36.06]Thank you.
[254:44.09]been looking at!
[254:49.86]R1!
[254:50.02]R1!
[254:51.70]R1!
[254:51.90]R1!
[254:53.42]Finally!
[255:00.56]Because the gong head got a 9.
[255:02.35]But that's what I mean.
[255:03.25]There's been so many cases where there's been like a gong head moment, and that's like a solid 9 out of 10.
[255:10.07]For every gong head moment, we've had a seven and a half frame a second, twelve enemy encounter.
[255:18.67]So, you know, pretty much all technical.
[255:28.40]On who?
[255:28.68]Who am I talking to?
[255:38.84]The Oro have devised special head and jaw apparatuses that allow them to radiate deadly sonic projections, stay clear, or suffer serious brain damage.
[255:53.45]Wait, is he reversing my sonic beam?
[255:58.99]Can I blow his head up?
[256:00.09]No, okay, he does sonic reversing.
[256:09.38]Can I not kill these guys?
[256:13.16]I've killed before.
[256:13.98]Is it this guy?
[256:16.34]I think it's this thing.
[256:37.99]If you dink them, you can hurt them.
[256:39.53]There we go.
[256:47.21]Where's fucking Gordon Freeman?
[256:50.14]Push it in.
[256:52.84]I'll use that reference again.
[257:12.62]Your brain has to be mushed.
[257:19.76]Don't even matter.
[257:20.30]Let's queue it up and get right in the guy's head when he pops over here.
[257:23.22]Where is he?
[257:26.39]He's right around this corner, I think, right?
[257:28.91]Yep.
[257:30.93]And say goodbye to your brain.
[257:39.08]Did I miss him?
[257:43.46]Sir?
[257:44.86]Huh?
[257:49.02]Nothing else in here.
[257:49.92]Just health kits.
[257:58.66]I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing here.
[258:00.12]Put my face in this.
[258:03.62]Stick my head in this machine.
[258:05.32]Drill.
[258:05.82]Did I just drill into my head?
[258:12.32]I can't move am I still gonna get attacked I can't even see somebody is seriously strangling me right now I'm losing air I think I killed somebody
[258:43.27]I killed a guy.
[258:44.47]I killed a guy.
[258:45.21]How are you supposed to even see where you're going?
[259:03.06]I accidentally exploded that guy, by the way.
[259:06.10]Let's try to get it.
[259:07.90]I'm gonna try to queue it up.
[259:15.76]There.
[259:16.64]It worked.
[259:17.84]Now this guy's not going to be following me around.
[259:22.00]So I need to find a way to get rid of these guys with the pulsating bloodborne heads.
[259:27.28]Or do I?
[259:28.18]I might be able to get this done right now.
[259:30.85]No, I'm definitely not.
[259:35.69]What is blocking me from moving this way?
[259:39.99]Can we pay attention to the ground here?
[259:41.43]What is in the way?
[259:44.33]Find it for me.
[259:45.99]Find it for me.
[259:46.95]Because it's not there.
[259:51.49]Fucking dickheads.
[259:54.51]Overload it, come on!
[259:55.23]Do it!
[260:06.24]Do it!
[260:44.56]I have to kill them.
[260:46.02]I have to just slowly wait till I can blow their heads up.
[260:56.56]Because this is a physically impossible encounter.
[261:00.72]Without doing that.
[261:10.56]I promise you.
[261:11.49]I promise you that it just doesn't work half the time.
[261:14.43]I'm giving you a one- I'm giving you a promise that that's what's happening.
[261:27.74]One, two, three.
[261:32.81]Alright, stun gun doesn't work on these guys.
[261:34.47]And then you fight them normally, so get up here.
[261:43.77]No, and there's another one of you.
[261:46.58]There's another one of you.
[261:47.72]Alright, should I turn them both off?
[261:51.80]You guys can't go, like, to a well and replenish that, right?
[262:03.85]Fucking stairs!
[262:07.43]What are you doing?
[262:08.37]Snap it!
[262:30.22]Who else?
[262:31.76]There's another one.
[262:32.52]Where is he?
[262:34.42]I refuse to do this encounter unless he's dead.
[262:43.08]Open the fucking door.
[262:49.65]Wasn't there three?
[262:50.39]I'm certain there was three.
[263:15.37]On this side Good afternoon
[263:51.12]You know, let's talk like video games for a second, alright?
[264:19.39]Look at if we're gonna do a video game discussion.
[264:23.87]Can somebody in this chat... Anybody.
[264:26.98]I don't... I'll take every answer.
[264:29.12]Any answer.
[264:31.54]What is one benefit of motion blur?
[264:37.18]One.
[264:40.03]I'll take one benefit.
[264:47.07]Is there one?
[264:50.25]And I'm talking, like, anything.
[264:59.50]It's just immersion, like, cinematic?
[265:03.36]Is that actually what?
[265:05.22]Reduces load on consoles?
[265:08.52]Okay.
[265:10.10]I just want to get a... A what is the deal here with...
[265:21.02]because in in my in my world there's no way I can't there's no weapons here to throw down
[265:52.38]Peek the shit out of him until he stops.
[265:59.39]I can.
[265:59.75]Oh god, this fucking Hulk.
[266:01.17]Why is the room on fire?
[266:04.71]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[266:20.81]Just shout at him?
[266:22.55]That's what I'm trying to do.
[266:23.60]I promise.
[266:24.74]It didn't hit him.
[266:29.56]I have to be closer to hit him.
[266:31.86]Let's stand still till I get my power back again.
[267:01.31]My god Let's link up and kill all the mutants right fucking professor X There's no escaping us mr. Thomas You don't have the fucking right influencing people's lives like this I
[267:47.23]And... Anything else?
[267:50.63]Should I climb up there and grab him by the face?
[267:55.69]Fight another one.
[267:56.31]Fight his other right-hand man.
[268:02.44]I think that didn't work that time.
[268:21.51]irrationally upset at this game why do we have to do why do we have to do a quick time event every single fucking melee fight and what to do
[268:50.43]I hate the word QTE.
[269:09.64]Again, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[269:13.31]Is this like a press conference?
[269:16.19]Like EA or something.
[269:18.29]Or whoever.
[269:18.83]It doesn't fucking matter.
[269:21.30]And in a brand new and in quick time... I'm already pissed.
[269:24.02]The piss is already going down my pants.
[269:31.14]I don't even want to listen to the ending cutscene.
[269:33.76]I don't even care.
[269:35.16]This is the last choice of the game.
[269:37.86]I'm just burning the whole thing to the ground.
[270:03.09]No.
[270:03.17]I'm not stopping.
[270:04.61]I don't care.
[270:06.17]I don't give a shit.
[270:08.84]It doesn't matter.
[270:12.54]QTE this.
[270:20.02]Stop!
[270:21.97]Stop it!
[270:22.71]Okay, I promise!
[270:23.81]I'll never put a quick time event in a game ever again!
[270:27.05]Just don't break my company's machine!
[270:45.03]Can't go that way.
[270:47.87]Can't go this way either.
[270:48.95]What is happening there?
[270:51.43]Finish him?
[270:53.97]Finish him?
[270:55.19]Is he over there?
[270:56.77]Is that him?
[271:17.56]How do I finish him?
[271:22.42]How do I finish him?
[271:29.63]Is that him?
[271:30.25]This is a random guy.
[271:35.17]Blow his head off.
[271:39.86]He's just staring at me.
[271:44.17]Alright, punch the mask off.
[271:45.95]Take the mask off.
[271:46.79]Darth Vader can't live with the mask on.
[271:50.48]Where am I?
[271:55.20]No, hold on.
[271:55.66]We gotta finish this Quick Dive event.
[272:14.53]I feel like my eyes are red.
[272:18.37]Let's see.
[272:19.37]We'll have to take a look after.
[272:20.59]We'll see if my eyes are red.
[272:22.41]Okay, he's dead.
[272:26.04]Come on down.
[272:30.58]Pipe.
[272:44.34]Break it.
[272:45.99]No, I can't go near him.
[272:47.47]I think I have to just survive, judging by the fact that I'm getting the shit beat out of me.
[272:53.33]How do I turn off Quick Time Events?
[272:55.92]It's just gonna get me in trouble.
[272:57.10]It's gonna get me killed.
[272:59.74]Being in a nine second Quick Time Event is gonna get me killed.
[273:03.77]Dead.
[273:05.01]Doornail.
[273:13.93]What's wrong with them?
[273:15.76]Why are they freaking out?
[273:24.72]God, I blocked it.
[273:46.55]Now what?
[273:49.07]I think I know what to do.
[273:53.16]No, apparently not.
[273:57.42]Get it?
[274:00.44]What?
[274:21.41]DOINK!
[274:26.54]The end was the- I didn't do R1 fast enough.
[274:31.04]QuickTime did get me killed.
[274:33.62]Oh, it's alright.
[274:34.76]It's okay, we're just gonna make sure we don't do that again.
[274:38.84]He's gonna- he's gonna bubble.
[274:39.70]Okay, go.
[274:40.68]Do it.
[274:41.96]Please have a recharge.
[274:45.32]Okay, R1.
[274:57.24]What am I doing here?
[274:57.94]I'm putting the controller down.
[275:01.27]Ethan, please listen to me.
[275:08.77]You need to get off that thing before it collapses.
[275:15.21]You're a fool.
[275:16.99]Shut up.
[275:18.23]What are the Orro's motives?
[275:22.07]Create hostility.
[275:24.23]The unwavering desire to fight.
[275:27.97]To unknowingly become perfect protectors.
[275:33.11]Protectors from what?
[275:37.44]Tell me!
[275:38.54]You don't know, do you?
[275:43.86]Christ, you're the fool.
[275:46.00]A puppet like everyone else.
[275:57.83]Good job, Ethan.
[276:04.41]No, no!
[276:04.75]He's got my hand!
[276:06.75]He's got my leg!
[276:07.81]It really is Star Wars.
[276:13.95]He just got Emperor'd.
[276:15.25]I... I Emperor'd him.
[276:25.48]Yeah!
[276:30.39]Well, you made it.
[276:31.03]That's the important thing.
[276:34.27]I love and hate this game.
[276:35.18]You know what has really hit the fan?
[276:37.40]You've uncovered something big, and I suspect over the next few weeks, more will be weeded out.
[276:42.18]Good thing, too.
[276:43.14]Some really influential people belong to the Oro.
[276:51.12]Hey, buddy.
[276:52.20]Soon as they fix that leg up, let's say you and I go get a drink.
[276:57.77]I don't think so, LaRue.
[276:59.53]Ah, this is it.
[277:00.45]I'm not doing it anymore.
[277:03.01]Call me Pierce.
[277:04.57]My friends call me Pierce.
[277:10.55]What I need is some sleep.
[277:13.78]Ocarina of Time.
[277:14.84]Better than Ocarina of Time.
[277:16.96]That is true.
[277:17.40]I did say that.
[277:24.88]You're right.
[277:25.26]I did mention that.
[277:30.34]We're gonna get a roll of credits.
[277:39.83]Last time the game ended with you being in the mirror and you turning around and being like... Gives you infinite ammo to be used in FPS.
[277:48.51]Three hours later!
[277:55.57]I'm now the President of the United States.
[277:57.67]Mr. President, what about the increase in violence?
[278:00.03]It appears to be a national problem.
[278:02.89]We're looking into the issue.
[278:04.67]We're also supporting all local agencies in their efforts to... Oh, uh, excuse me for a moment.
[278:15.88]There's nothing on that paper.
[278:17.24]Oh, it's a different perspective.
[278:23.81]What does it say?
[278:26.30]It went that high up?
[278:27.80]Even the president was involved?
[278:32.66]The remedy is among us.
[278:34.31]R1.
[279:02.84]Well, there it is.
[279:09.51]Extras.
[279:11.53]Rewards.
[279:13.11]Didn't do very much.
[279:14.05]Unlockables.
[279:16.15]Unlocked by Beat Cop.
[279:20.08]It's a Polaroid of somebody's face.
[279:24.30]See those red eyes.
[279:27.46]Did you see that last image of like...
[279:33.25]Not really.
[279:36.47]That game was good.
[279:38.99]That game was good.
[279:40.95]All the shit I was talking in the end there is because that shit was awful.
[279:44.79]That was fucking awful.
[279:45.75]You know what's really funny?
[279:52.68]Shadow of Mordor, the last 40 minutes of Shadow of Mordor is awful as well.
[280:00.70]So Monolith makes fantastic games, but when they get to the end, they just hit the delete button and go as fast as they can to the exit because they're not ready to end it.
[280:12.74]Same thing happened in Shadow of Mordor.
[280:16.39]Literally the last thing you do in Shadow of Mordor is press Q. No, not Shadow of Mordor, not Shadow of War.
[280:29.86]I'm not saying that's what happened with this game, but... Similar.
[280:37.81]It was great.
[280:38.37]The whole experience-wise, it was a lot of fun.
[280:43.19]But just with shit like this, you really do get to see.
[280:48.03]You get to see in real time just how desperate, absolutely fucking desperate, some of these games are to be on PC.
[281:03.07]Condemned 1 was on PC, and it played fine.
[281:05.69]It played great.
[281:06.15]I mean, it was, like, less than 60 FPS, but it wasn't.
[281:12.16]You just get to see how a PC port is... Even if a PC port is bad, it's still way better than, like, it being on console.
[281:20.60]It just is.
[281:29.43]If I were to... If you want to give a score for Condemned 1...
[281:33.18]9.
[281:34.94]Like, straight up, like, 9.
[281:35.68]That game was fucking awesome.
[281:37.96]I loved almost every second of Condemned 1.
[281:41.24]Condemned 2?
[281:43.79]Maybe like a 6.5.
[281:48.25]Bump it up maybe to a 7.
[281:49.63]Maybe like a 6.8.
[281:52.27]Because of the bear.
[281:52.93]Like, the bear was unbelievable.
[281:54.39]They should have just made the whole fucking game the bear.
[281:57.35]Instead of all the random weird shit that they did for no reason.
[282:08.89]What would I write?
[282:09.39]Ocarina of Time.
[282:14.35]Ocarina of Time is like, yeah, I'd like a 6.
[282:16.33]4 out of 10, 7 out of 10 with bear.
[282:23.81]Yeah, without bear, lose at least a full point and a half.
[282:28.75]This is like a 5, or like a 5.5 without the bear part.
[282:34.49]But it was still enjoyable.
[282:39.13]This whole experience was enjoyable.
[282:41.95]I just wish I had a PS3 1.6 to be able to run it at a consistent 20-30 frames a second.
[282:49.94]It's really my only major complaint, and it is a huge one.
[282:56.57]Would you say 5 is an average game?
[282:58.15]I wouldn't.
[283:00.53]Because 5 is a failing grade.
[283:08.60]I keep skipping this cutscene.
[283:09.96]It's probably annoying you guys, I'm sorry.
[283:12.90]I think of a point system like I would grades.
[283:17.14]So if you get a 50 on a test, like a 5 on a test, it's an F. A 58 is an F. A 59 is an F. A 60 is a D-.
[283:20.42]65 is a D, 68, 69 is a D+.
[283:34.50]So I would say somewhere around like 70 is probably an average.
[283:37.82]Or like 72, 73 is an average game.
[283:45.59]And the reason why that is... Is because no game companies get... That scale... You should be correct.
[283:52.63]You should be correct.
[283:54.27]I'm gonna just take this off for a minute.
[283:57.81]You should be correct when you say that.
[284:01.30]But unless a game is unplayable mess, it doesn't get less than a fucking 6.
[284:10.46]A 5 should be like 1, 5, 5, 10 in the grand point scheme of things.
[284:17.72]Yes.
[284:18.94]But nobody gives a game under a 4.
[284:20.68]Because they're terrified to do that.
[284:21.70]They don't want to do that.
[284:26.34]If 5 is a fail, then why have a 10 point skill?
[284:28.38]No, but exactly.
[284:32.27]But can you name a video game that was, like, below average that got a 4 or, like, a 3?
[284:39.31]No.
[284:41.53]If 5 isn't... Think of, like, the last, like, few... Think of the last 10 average games that you've thought of, like, you've played, that you would say was an average game.
[284:50.80]Does it have a 4 or a 5 on IGN?
[284:54.54]Or anywhere?
[284:55.48]Does it have, like, a 1.5 on GameSpot or, like, a 2?
[284:58.20]No.
[284:59.76]No.
[285:01.81]Average has turned into 7 out of 10.
[285:05.35]Just because every outlet is terrified to give something less than a 5.
[285:12.53]Even if it should be there.
[285:13.65]Even if it's like, that's what we did.
[285:14.99]If a 10 point scale is a 10 point scale, then 3 or 4 is below average.
[285:20.96]But like, not... It's below average.
[285:27.93]I would say, on my scale of things, because I'm talking about, like, 50, not... Like, a 100-point scale, not a 10-point scale.
[285:38.34]Six and a half to seven and a half is where I'd put a game at average.
[285:48.56]And there are games that just get nines because they have to.
[285:55.95]Regardless of if they change anything or do anything or make anything new ideas or anything like that.
[286:01.43]What does World War 2 have?
[286:02.85]What does COD World War 2 have right now?
[286:05.75]It's like an 89 or something, right?
[286:15.46]Let's see.
[286:16.32]COD has an 81 on Metacritic.
[286:19.60]That means like people... Okay, so like... This has like an 80.
[286:22.04]80, 80, 80, 60...
[286:27.34]Is COD World War II an actual below average 4 or 5 game?
[286:37.63]Maybe, I'm not sure.
[286:43.97]I mean, if you're talking about just making the same video game 10 times in a row, do you get to have an 8 or a 9?
[286:53.44]Let's say Call of Duty 3, or COD 4.
[286:57.27]Let's say COD 4 was a 9 out of 10.
[287:00.11]If you make COD 4 eight more times in a row, do they deserve a 9 out of 10?
[287:06.43]Even though COD 4 was a 9 out of 10, do all the others get 9s out of 10s too?
[287:13.27]Because they were COD 4 again.
[287:15.39]Because that's what's happening.
[287:20.06]No, right?
[287:20.82]The answer is no.
[287:32.48]Why are independent reviewers scared to give lower than a 4 or 5?
[287:35.40]Because it pisses people off.
[287:39.30]If you actually write an article about COD World War II and you give it a 4 out of 10, you're going to lose.
[287:47.29]People are going to hate your website.
[287:49.23]There's going to be a huge amount of people that are just like, you're a fucking idiot.
[287:51.63]Fuck you.
[287:52.09]You suck.
[287:53.21]Your opinion's meaningless.
[287:55.32]And then they don't come back.
[287:56.56]And you don't get ad revenue.
[287:57.84]And your company goes under.
[288:00.38]Pretty much.
[288:07.69]The others weren't COD 4, though.
[288:08.95]They were worse.
[288:09.93]Well, there you go.
[288:11.26]That, like, proves why it doesn't make any sense.
[288:14.78]Because if COD 4, if Modern Warfare was, like, the pinnacle of Call of Duty, fun, exciting, multiplayer, fun, awesome, and then all the other ones were the same game, but just made a little shittier every time, why does it get the same score every single time?
[288:32.66]Hmm.
[288:35.30]Interesting.
[288:44.11]But anyways, Condemned as a series, loved it.
[288:48.77]It was awesome.
[288:52.94]I dislike this game for being less like the first one.
[288:55.70]No, I mean, I dislike this game for a lot of technical reasons.
[289:00.50]It was just awful, technically.
[289:06.11]Like, if Modern Warfare 4 ran at, like, 60 FPS and then COD 5 ran at, like, 22, people would be very upset about it.
[289:16.58]My experience with Condemned 1 was on PC.
[289:19.82]And going from Condemned 1 to Condemned 2 and losing all of that technical, in quotes, quality was very hard to get over.
[289:28.47]It was.
[289:39.80]But, I'm not going to say I didn't have fun, because I did.
[289:47.24]The loss of the game sucked.
[289:52.04]Yeah, but we got to see the bear, we got to throw stuff at people.
[289:55.34]That's a huge, that's at least a full point I had.
[289:58.36]You couldn't throw anything in Condemned 1.
[290:00.68]You could throw every object in this game.
[290:02.28]We got a lot of gongs, so that has to say something.
[290:11.94]Forget about my, like, knee-jerk reactions when I'm venting anger in a video game where I'm like, that's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.
[290:17.53]Is this the worst thing I've ever seen?
[290:19.05]That's just me being a turd.
[290:21.03]That's me, like, just venting frustration.
[290:22.61]It doesn't really mean anything.
[290:23.53]I mean, it does, but at the same time, it's just, like, venting.
[290:38.25]It's the worst thing I've ever seen.
[290:46.81]You're a turd.
[290:50.30]Throwing the baton in the guard's face and having him do a backflip.
[290:53.40]That's worth a full point.
[290:54.86]It is.
[290:56.64]Because that's enjoyment in the game.
[290:59.08]Regardless if the game is not as good as the first one or the game's bad and, you know, whatever you have, you want to scale it.
[291:05.49]There's still lots of fun moments to be had in the game, right?
[291:10.23]And it is, yes, it is better than Wheelman.
[291:11.75]That's absolutely correct.
[291:14.42]But thank you for watching, everybody.
[291:15.72]Thanks for sticking around.
[291:16.38]Condemned 2 is done.
[291:18.52]The Condemned series is done.
[291:20.96]And I loved it.
[291:22.30]It was great.
[291:24.85]I loved the first one.
[291:26.97]And the first one is part of the series, so I can say that I loved it, right?
[291:36.76]I'm going to go back and read some bits that I missed from earlier tonight.
[291:43.49]It was a few that I, uh, like five to ten, I think, that I didn't get to.
[291:49.34]Uh, right here.
[291:50.14]DubskyDude, thanks for the one dollar earlier.
[291:51.68]When you were talking about the bear, you said, you'll love this level, you'll have so much fun, you can't bear it.
[291:59.05]Thank you, Dubsky.
[292:00.51]Fraxter, thanks for the one dollar.
[292:01.97]What is the meaning of life?
[292:04.29]Uh, I can answer that question.
[292:08.07]The meaning of life is just personal happiness.
[292:13.71]Just being happy.
[292:15.02]That's the meaning of life.
[292:15.74]That's what you have to be.
[292:17.02]Happy.
[292:23.06]However you achieve that, that's how you do it.
[292:26.01]I can't tell you the meaning.
[292:26.99]Because I don't know what your meaning is.
[292:29.35]I know what my meaning is.
[292:36.26]Grizzly1620, thanks for the bits.
[292:39.21]Fun fact, bears have been known to survive a shotgun blast, point blank to the face, and proceed attacking their victim.
[292:45.95]You're fucked.
[292:47.89]You're fucked.
[292:48.85]That's not me saying that, that's him saying that.
[292:52.60]That's like, what, like I'm disagreeing?
[292:53.88]Like, you're fucked, dude.
[292:54.90]What are you talking about?
[292:58.46]OG, thank you OG Jeff Tor for the $1.
[293:00.38]Hey ladies, y'all ready to stop?
[293:04.46]Whatever that means.
[293:05.72]Thanks, dude.
[293:07.06]BluePunda, thanks for the five dollars.
[293:08.54]David is a dirty fucker.
[293:10.74]Love you, Dermot.
[293:11.32]I think David might be watching the stream.
[293:14.02]That's not... That's BluePunda saying that.
[293:16.76]That's not me.
[293:18.16]I'm just saying it out loud.
[293:20.62]Thank you for the five dollars.
[293:22.35]Hey, Dimny, thanks for the $1.30.
[293:24.43]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[293:25.59]It's Grandpa here, and today I want to show you how I run a restaurant.
[293:29.54]So the game's called Papa's Berseria.
[293:32.20]Oh, oh.
[293:33.36]It's a really fun game.
[293:35.00]You run your own simulated restaurant.
[293:37.20]It's a fast food joint, which I love those.
[293:39.62]So let's get started here.
[293:40.67]Gonna get my first customer.
[293:41.75]Is that what I'm supposed to do?
[293:43.35]Thank you.
[293:45.65]Player Noob, thanks for the $14.00.
[293:49.57]Holy moly, my first Jerma stream.
[293:51.22]I've been a big fan of the YouTube stuff.
[293:52.78]Glad I could finally catch a live show.
[293:54.16]Well, thanks, dude.
[293:55.92]If you're still here, thank you for the 14 bucks.
[293:58.54]Thanks for sticking around.
[294:00.56]Is it player noob or player noob?
[294:05.78]You can't pay me to say stuff.
[294:09.14]No, but he wasn't paying me to say that.
[294:11.57]He didn't say...
[294:13.39]Hey, Jerma, like, read this.
[294:15.75]He just put that up in quotes.
[294:17.81]That's it.
[294:18.85]And I decided that I was going to read that halfway through.
[294:23.98]No, but he didn't pay me to say that.
[294:26.20]He placed it there, and my dog mentality just decided I was going to do it.
[294:38.77]But I read this anyways.
[294:40.03]Yeah, well, but you can't be like, here's $100.
[294:43.97]Here's $1,000.
[294:46.49]I want you to say this.
[294:47.83]I'm not going to say whatever you put.
[294:49.45]What if you put something terrible?
[294:50.47]I'm not going to do it.
[294:51.05]It doesn't matter how much money is there, you know?
[294:57.36]But thank you, nonetheless.
[294:58.38]Thank you, Nock, for the $1.
[294:59.80]Hey, Italics, can you stop killing puppies?
[295:03.58]No, I think that's when the dog was hit there at the end.
[295:07.80]Thank you, Noctil.
[295:11.20]Die.
[295:11.62]Let me get your name right because my brain can't function.
[295:16.89]Die goes a poochie.
[295:21.37]I'm going to call you Diego or Diegos.
[295:24.35]Thanks for the five bucks.
[295:27.12]Uh, thank you so much for that.
[295:28.84]Germ, a longtime fan here, watched you over on YouTube for years and never really got into Twitch because of the difference between our time zones.
[295:36.25]Thank you for the videos on Germa too.
[295:38.72]Well, thank, uh, Holy Mac because he has been the one putting those together.
[295:43.06]He's been doing a great job.
[295:44.48]But, welcome.
[295:46.62]Hope you enjoy yourself.
[295:47.50]Hopefully it's... At least, it's not exactly the same as it's been on YouTube, but I try to keep it a similar attitude that I have on YouTube.
[295:57.19]So, welcome.
[295:59.21]And thanks for the five bucks.
[296:01.81]Lactose Cow, thanks for the one dollar.
[296:03.67]It's Danny DeVito's birthday.
[296:04.91]What did you get him?
[296:07.32]What a fucking wonderful person.
[296:10.84]You guys see the image of Danny DeVito walking his dog?
[296:15.51]It's like the perfect image.
[296:17.31]It is a perfect image.
[296:19.41]I want to get it posted on my wall back here in a frame.
[296:22.95]That's great.
[296:28.10]And Adam, thank you for the $5.
[296:33.38]They say, Jeremy, you got to help me.
[296:35.10]A man broke into my house and saw I was watching your stream.
[296:39.38]He said, hold on, is that the one and only Jerma985?
[296:41.66]I heard he's the funniest guy on the internet.
[296:44.89]Now he's demanding that you tell a funny joke and he's holding me hostage.
[296:49.31]Jeremy, if you fail to make this hardened criminal laugh, then I'm going to die.
[296:55.75]It's up to you.
[296:56.31]Well, that was an hour ago.
[296:58.40]Has he just been still sitting there like, has he done it?
[297:00.64]Is he going to say it yet?
[297:03.40]It's a bit late.
[297:07.84]Well, if he's still there,
[297:12.06]crime.
[297:12.46]They're more like grime.
[297:15.22]Guy hasn't washed his hands in like two hours.
[297:19.81]His hands are dirty.
[297:23.69]He's got dirty hands.
[297:26.13]Yeah?
[297:28.43]Huh?
[297:30.35]His hands are dirty.
[297:32.24]No, wait, don't do it.
[297:33.36]He's done.
[297:38.72]Thank you to Asha.
[297:39.74]Asha, why don't you wait for the $1?
[297:43.44]Yo, I'm gonna let you finish, but real quick, Modern Warfare 2 was a 10 out of 10.
[297:49.31]I mean, it was, but the first few Call of Duties that came out for modern consoles were good.
[297:57.89]And even if they were terrible, they were still, it was a new thing.
[298:01.23]The whole arcade multiplayer online shooter with killstreaks and points and prestiging, that was an interesting idea.
[298:09.64]No one had really been doing that.
[298:13.48]So they made a few of these games that had those ideas, they had that interesting concept put into them, and they took off.
[298:20.45]And then they just became Madden.
[298:23.41]Call of Duty is just fucking John Madden presents football.
[298:27.31]And it's gotten to a point where there's been so many Maddens, there's been a Madden every single year,
[298:33.76]That they're all the same game.
[298:36.00]They're bleeding into each other.
[298:37.69]There's been a Madden enough times in the years in a row where Madden is now old enough to drive.
[298:46.95]Madden is getting close to being able to drink alcohol.
[298:50.61]That's how many years Madden's been alive.
[298:56.76]It's just gun Madden.
[299:00.83]John Madden's just barely getting to the age where he can drink.
[299:04.43]At like 72.
[299:04.95]Yeah, he's almost 21.
[299:09.22]Anyways, thank you, though.
[299:20.53]Thank you, Asha, for the $1.
[299:21.87]CC131988.
[299:22.39]Thanks for the $1.
[299:25.31]Call of Duty sells as the same game over and over because they have a mind eraser frog.
[299:32.44]They kind of do.
[299:33.22]It's called their multiplayer trailer they put out.
[299:36.62]That shows all these interesting, awesome things.
[299:38.98]But it's just, you do the same shit you did in the last Call of Duty.
[299:43.58]And they have a bunch of famous actors do cool commercials.
[299:54.09]That's pretty much how it happens.
[300:03.29]Yeah, John Madden is going to be the president.
[300:10.72]It's funny because, like, easy, everybody.
[300:16.82]Like, how funny.
[300:17.36]Like, if you told me, like, oh, yeah, John Madden.
[300:20.79]Like, John Madden is going to be president.
[300:23.01]Like, oh, yeah, we're going to do the football.
[300:25.79]Like, Donald Trump is the president right now.
[300:28.86]If ten years ago, do you think that anybody would have believed you when you said that that was if you came back from the future?
[300:33.80]And you were like hey Donald Trump's gonna be president like regardless of how you feel politically just like take that out delete your like political view and Like your beliefs, right?
[300:46.35]Can you fucking imagine a world ten years ago where Donald Trump was gonna be president?
[300:51.69]You'd be like What are you talking about?
[300:55.63]What?
[300:56.75]No, he's not
[300:58.66]You're from the future.
[301:00.95]Get the fuck out of here.
[301:02.23]That guy would get murdered.
[301:04.75]No one would believe him.
[301:05.67]He would run back and be like, you guys don't understand.
[301:07.59]Donald Trump is the president.
[301:09.27]And aliens land, and two years after that, we've got to make a device that shoots a laser into the sky.
[301:14.28]And we'd be like, hold on.
[301:15.98]Donald Trump's president?
[301:17.56]I believe the alien shit.
[301:19.02]But no, don't listen to this guy.
[301:20.64]Fucking get him out of here.
[301:23.68]Aliens landing would have been more believable than Donald Trump is president.
[301:28.03]Think about that.
[301:33.09]Like, remove politics from the whole thing.
[301:37.07]Donald Trump said this, but he said that.
[301:40.65]Forget it.
[301:40.97]Just don't even think about that.
[301:42.15]Just think about, like, who he is and who he was.
[301:44.33]He's the guy that, like, ran the Miss America pageant and had a reality TV show where he fired people.
[301:52.78]Just, like, remove politically.
[301:55.48]It is, like, odd and interesting to think about that, like, 10 years ago.
[302:07.73]I honestly completely forgot Trump was a person until 2016.
[302:10.69]Donald Trump gave Condemned 2 a 10 out of 10.
[302:19.27]Impeach him!
[302:27.66]The Simpsons made this joke because it sounded unbelievable.
[302:30.94]Yeah.
[302:32.32]I remember watching that.
[302:37.21]Alright, that's going to be my time, guys.
[302:39.21]Have a good weekend.
[302:39.83]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[302:41.95]I will actually be live on Sunday.
[302:46.63]You'll see me on Sunday because I want to play Hand of Fate 2 again.
[302:48.93]I want to get back into that.
[302:49.98]There's still a lot more to do.
[302:52.42]So you'll probably see a stream on Sunday afternoon at some point, Sunday night.
[302:59.40]Yeah, we'll play some more Hand of Fate 2.
[303:06.11]Uh, right at the very end here, Reaper, thanks for the five dollars.
[303:09.51]You mind looking at this frog for a second?
[303:11.77]Flash.
[303:14.29]That means I have to forget everything.
[303:17.81]Thanks for the politics and screaming stream.
[303:23.01]I really hope that's not how people, like, think of me.
[303:27.52]I'm gonna take that.
[303:28.54]I'm gonna hold on to that one.
[303:29.64]Like, I'm gonna be, like, in my bed tonight being like, was that, like, a scream stream tonight?
[303:36.47]Did I, like... Lost all my memory.
[303:40.07]Alright, goodnight, everybody.
[303:45.64]See you on Sunday.
[303:47.08]Off schedule.
[303:48.64]Sunday night.
[303:49.46]Something like that.
[303:50.84]Take care, everybody.
[303:51.84]Thanks for sticking around.
[303:54.45]And goodnight.
[304:25.52]you
[305:00.38]you
[305:59.83]It's not even the right picture forget it
[306:04.42]Never mind.
[306:04.76]That's the wrong picture.
[306:05.54]I put on the wrong picture.
[306:06.30]I was trying to put another picture.
[306:08.16]Whatever.
[306:08.74]Good night.
[306:09.22]Bye.
[306:10.67]There was bugs on the screen for a minute there.
