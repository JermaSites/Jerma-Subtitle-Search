[01:56.41]Hi, everybody.
[01:59.55]I had to change the title.
[02:01.35]I wasn't feeling that title.
[02:03.96]You know, the title that just said, Kingdom Come.
[02:09.06]That's it.
[02:09.48]That was the whole title.
[02:11.08]Need to have something funny.
[02:13.06]Something that grabs an audience.
[02:16.30]Give me two seconds.
[02:51.62]It still says Kingdom Come.
[02:52.80]It shouldn't.
[02:53.64]It should say something funny.
[02:54.69]It should say something really funny.
[02:59.29]See if anybody can figure out that joke.
[03:03.53]It's updated.
[03:03.97]It should be there.
[03:04.97]Is it not there?
[03:05.49]It should be.
[03:09.53]I'm waiting to see if people laugh about this one.
[03:14.77]Oh, that's funny.
[03:16.31]That's funny.
[03:18.67]It's updated, but it's not funny.
[03:20.15]I think something's wrong.
[03:22.39]That is funny.
[03:23.69]I'm sorry, that's funny.
[03:25.65]Yeah, you show that to Conan O'Brien, Conan O'Brien would be like, huh, I need you on my show.
[03:31.17]And I would get on the show.
[03:33.53]I'd get introduced as world famous, number one twitch.tv streamer.
[03:40.46]And I'd sit down, I'd be in a nice suit, we'd be talking about it.
[03:51.02]Alright, let's go.
[03:51.48]We're going to play more Kingdom Come.
[03:52.70]Kingdom Come.
[03:54.46]Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[03:56.50]Just going to pick up exactly where we left off last night.
[04:02.17]And not going to waste time here.
[04:04.07]Let's just go.
[04:04.83]We're ready.
[04:05.17]And there's the game.
[04:09.93]And here we go.
[04:12.66]So those of you guys that are new, and you didn't see the last couple of streams, this is an RPG.
[04:20.04]Still didn't steal the stuff from this guy, but it's alright.
[04:22.08]Let's get it all.
[04:24.10]I got a lot of money.
[04:26.66]So a silver ring.
[04:29.13]Does this have any properties on it?
[04:30.45]Am I going to get like plus five frost damage if I wear this?
[04:35.37]Well, there's no audio on the game.
[04:36.87]That needs to change.
[04:40.33]There we go.
[04:43.35]Suspicious man-at-arms dead, there he is, okay.
[04:47.29]Now I have to go back to Ginger and tell him everything's fine.
[04:49.78]Let's put the sword away so we don't do any suspicious behavior.
[04:59.50]What?
[05:02.71]Look here at what?
[05:03.41]What do you want, Bernard?
[05:05.25]Uh, this is... This sword, Mercenary's Bedfellow.
[05:13.16]How much better is this?
[05:17.00]Well, no.
[05:17.52]We gotta go back to Ginger.
[05:19.40]Weapons.
[05:21.36]They're the exact same.
[05:23.30]I have the same weapon.
[05:24.16]This one's just covered in blood.
[05:29.63]So we can sell this one.
[05:31.59]Or this one.
[05:32.81]Depending on how worn down it is by the time we get back to town.
[05:39.71]We got a new... Oh, we got Sia's haircut.
[05:42.69]Nice, okay.
[05:43.53]Should I wear that?
[05:44.95]Yeah, I needed it, I guess.
[05:49.65]Anything else?
[05:50.45]Leather Gherkin?
[05:51.99]Put it on, why not?
[05:57.31]Why am I acting strange?
[06:01.07]Jerma's acting strange.
[06:02.57]This is probably pre-recorded.
[06:05.90]Why am I acting strange?
[06:09.72]I just want to play the game.
[06:12.64]Why?
[06:12.74]Is it because I'm going like, okay, what do we got here?
[06:15.02]Because I'm doing the, why?
[06:16.98]Because I'm doing like the general guy is doing a YouTube video or guy streaming a game saying everything he's doing.
[06:23.75]What?
[06:23.99]Come on.
[06:25.09]Okay, let's get, okay, let's get this horse here.
[06:28.67]Go down the path.
[06:32.15]Yeah, we got a typical YouTube video here.
[06:33.73]We got trees.
[06:35.35]Oh, this is beautiful, nice, okay.
[06:38.01]I think I need to go... This way, which A is there, so... Not sure about that.
[06:48.44]Is that why this is a weird stream?
[06:52.84]But that's what I'm supposed to be doing!
[06:55.19]Don't you want me to be like, okay, okay, so we have here, what's that?
[06:58.97]Oh, caravan, okay.
[07:01.47]What's in that caravan, guys?
[07:03.01]Found a caravan, guys.
[07:09.05]Oh!
[07:10.35]It was an accident.
[07:13.34]Yes, you're supposed to do that.
[07:16.00]Nothing even in here.
[07:16.68]Tough.
[07:19.24]I just got jebaited.
[07:20.48]Okay.
[07:27.87]Free recorded.
[07:33.65]I like it weird.
[07:34.81]What do you mean you like it weird?
[07:39.56]Where's Ginger hiding again?
[07:40.82]In like a hut down here?
[07:43.79]You gotta collect payment, you know?
[07:50.15]Subscribe and smash the like button for more videos.
[07:55.43]The like button doesn't do anything, by the way.
[07:58.05]You want an insider YouTuber tip?
[08:01.02]The like button doesn't do a damn thing.
[08:04.50]Like six years ago it did.
[08:05.80]It doesn't do anything now.
[08:16.09]Shit.
[08:16.41]I was trying to make up for last night.
[08:17.55]It took too long to take it out.
[08:21.17]Yeah, the like button is just like a... It's essentially now what the like button is on YouTube is like Twitter.
[08:30.55]Dislikes.
[08:31.67]Dislikes don't do anything either.
[08:33.88]They're inflated.
[08:34.82]It doesn't make any sense.
[08:35.62]I don't even know why people do that tactic anymore.
[08:38.26]Okay, guys, if we get to 50,000 likes, why?
[08:41.50]What is it going to do for you?
[08:45.64]That's not gonna do anything.
[08:52.43]Let's go find him.
[08:59.77]Higher chance of getting on trending?
[09:01.68]That whole algorithm is a fucking inside of a blender at this point.
[09:06.88]They've changed that thing so many times.
[09:13.17]Oh, it means more money.
[09:14.37]I remember back in the day, people thought that if you were like a partnered YouTuber and you got a like on a video, it got you like a dollar.
[09:24.04]That would have been fucking crazy.
[09:25.12]Alright, here you go, Ginger.
[09:25.92]What's going on, man?
[09:27.62]I bear good tidings.
[09:29.68]Already?
[09:32.06]I'm quick.
[09:33.46]Whoa!
[09:33.56]That's great.
[09:34.09]What?
[09:40.58]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[09:44.12]There we go.
[09:44.74]Storm of Shadow, thanks for the $50.
[09:46.88]$50 from Storm of Shadows.
[09:51.08]Storm of Shadow, no plurals.
[09:52.84]Why am I adding a plural?
[09:53.78]Late streamer makes funny joke on pre-recorded stream.
[09:55.92]Here, have some bits.
[09:57.36]With this I achieve the next level of bit badge.
[10:00.48]Your content and laughs they bring are worth every penny.
[10:03.54]Thanks a lot, Storm.
[10:05.41]I think they're adding even more bit badges.
[10:10.53]Did I see that right?
[10:13.70]They're adding like five more tiers or something.
[10:15.98]It's gonna get like insane.
[10:17.42]That's like a ton of money.
[10:19.98]But thank you so much, Storm.
[10:22.38]You rock, dude.
[10:22.90]50 bucks.
[10:24.53]Bits are fake.
[10:25.17]They don't even do anything.
[10:26.71]Their likes are the only real... You just go.
[10:30.19]He'll go.
[10:30.73]He'll do it.
[10:32.26]God bless you too.
[10:32.64]God bless us everyone.
[10:33.24]Is he killable yet?
[10:33.62]Why is this locked?
[10:34.04]Is this his house?
[10:34.98]Dude, you're sleeping on a bunch of dirty laundry.
[10:36.68]Alright, well, whatever.
[10:38.44]I turned it in.
[11:04.00]So what do I have to do now?
[11:05.72]What's on... What's a task?
[11:08.62]Okay, go to Talonburg.
[11:09.82]A lot of places in this game.
[11:12.63]We can do the main mission here.
[11:14.51]Report the progress of the investigation to Sir Radzig.
[11:17.33]Let's go there.
[11:20.03]Turned in that stupid thing.
[11:23.78]Let's go this way.
[11:30.50]How many people have I killed so far?
[11:33.23]Um, innocent people?
[11:34.41]One.
[11:35.39]Just one.
[11:36.77]And that guy deserved it, because he was the guy that cost me so much rage in the first stream.
[11:41.87]I have not, I have not gone on the typical, oh my god, there he is, he's going on a rampage in town, he like shot a bunch of people with arrows, he went on horseback and like ran into somebody's house, and on horse, in house, cut the whole, that's a good idea, I'm gonna do that right now.
[11:55.95]Yeah, let's do that right now.
[12:02.92]Not enough.
[12:06.64]Pebbles.
[12:09.74]I probably will die instantly.
[12:12.45]My character's a joke right now.
[12:18.43]More horsemanship.
[12:19.33]Nice.
[12:21.87]Level that up.
[12:22.91]Nice and swift.
[12:26.64]That guy wasn't innocent.
[12:27.50]So yeah, well, that's true then.
[12:28.98]So I didn't do anything bad in quotes yet.
[12:33.85]I mean, maybe I will.
[12:34.55]Stay tuned.
[12:36.89]Stay tuned for that one.
[12:39.20]There he is.
[12:44.04]I have another lead on the bandits.
[12:46.13]I managed to find a clue to the whereabouts of the bandits.
[12:49.05]Excellent.
[12:49.95]Bernard already told me what's been happening, but I'd like to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
[12:54.17]The whole story or just the gist of it, sir?
[12:56.77]It's up to you.
[12:58.79]What?
[13:00.47]I'm giving him just brief.
[13:01.95]Well, in the end, I tracked down the stable boy who fled in fear.
[13:05.19]Why?
[13:05.42]What's with people giving him the gist of it?
[13:06.74]I thought he had a gun in his hand.
[13:08.10]He put me on the trail of a crofter from Užit with a limp.
[13:11.06]And his name?
[13:13.13]The boy didn't know him by name, only by sight.
[13:15.96]But if I ask around, I'm sure folk will know who limps and keeps peculiar company.
[13:20.70]Villagers like to gossip.
[13:22.16]But what if he's not there?
[13:23.54]He could have fled, maybe even to Kuttenberg.
[13:25.68]If I don't find him in Užice, I'll ask around.
[13:28.30]Someone will know something about him.
[13:30.92]Better go to Užice then.
[13:32.45]Find this limping footpad and get the names of the others out of him.
[13:35.43]They have to face justice for what they did.
[13:37.55]I want to see them hang.
[13:38.49]Okay.
[13:39.15]Bring him to me in Merhoyed and I'll decide on his fate.
[13:41.75]So we're going to capture him alive.
[13:47.57]Thanks for the money.
[13:49.61]We need to be prepared for this one.
[13:52.47]So what do we got?
[13:53.19]Oh, I can go back to town here.
[13:56.47]We gotta go, oh boy, that's far away.
[13:58.83]We gotta go all the way over here to find this guy in Ushitz.
[14:02.63]We have to go to... Thalmberg.
[14:05.13]And then from Thalmberg, we need to go up to the top right.
[14:09.53]Alright, any loose ends to clean up here?
[14:11.77]I mean, this, I refuse to do that.
[14:15.73]What is this?
[14:16.97]Quest giver.
[14:19.43]There's a bunch of quests over here.
[14:21.36]Let's stay on task first.
[14:23.26]I'm gonna go to Thalmberg.
[14:24.16]I feel like I'm saying the name of this town wrong.
[14:28.49]Do they have an Armorsmith here?
[14:30.79]Combat Arena.
[14:32.51]Traitor.
[14:34.49]No, we're going to go back to Rete.
[14:48.77]Can we just start up Spore?
[14:51.05]No.
[14:55.81]Kill the king.
[14:57.31]Uh-oh, we've got a random encounter.
[15:01.33]Halt right there.
[15:01.91]Show me what you have on you.
[15:03.33]What do you mean, show me?
[15:04.33]What's he talking about?
[15:07.09]What do I have on me?
[15:12.61]I have one stolen pair of pants.
[15:15.59]What if I drop these on the ground right now?
[15:17.23]Is that it?
[15:19.69]Okay, wait a minute.
[15:21.11]This guy's mad because I have a pair of pants that aren't mine.
[15:23.49]But if I throw them on the ground...
[15:27.68]then I'm not a criminal anymore.
[15:31.12]Okay, here we go.
[15:36.68]Are you deaf?
[15:38.54]That's it, there it is!
[15:41.30]It's on the ground right in front of you.
[15:42.92]Alright, what the fuck do you want?
[15:45.30]What's going on?
[15:47.66]Such are my orders.
[15:48.86]What do you mean, your orders?
[15:49.70]Alright, search me.
[15:52.82]I have nothing to hide.
[15:53.52]Ugh, come on then.
[15:57.71]What?
[15:59.05]What are you talking about?
[16:05.11]What are you talking about?
[16:05.89]What did he take from me?
[16:06.87]What did he take from me?
[16:08.37]What did you take from me?
[16:09.36]What, like two apples?
[16:16.86]What did he take?
[16:19.80]He didn't take the sword.
[16:20.70]I still have the sword.
[16:21.60]I have everything I just previously owned.
[16:32.25]Oh, yeah.
[16:32.93]Excuse me.
[16:33.47]You have a fucking illegal smoked sausage on you.
[16:36.07]I'll be taking that.
[16:36.91]It's a lie.
[16:37.39]He just wanted food.
[16:42.15]Well, I don't even want that fucking thing.
[16:43.73]Wait, do I?
[16:44.17]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm taking it.
[16:49.42]What?
[17:00.73]Why'd I drop it on the ground?
[17:02.43]Oh, my God.
[17:02.67]Oh, fuck you, guy.
[17:03.15]Give me a break.
[17:03.93]Come on.
[17:04.57]Uh...
[17:15.33]Look, I can't tell you anymore.
[17:17.37]The fate of the whole empire hangs in the balance between King Wenceslas and King Sigismund.
[17:21.97]This sucks.
[17:22.77]High politics, you know?
[17:25.25]Because I put the thing on the ground and I picked it up.
[17:27.49]Not a chance.
[17:28.03]I just lost 60 fucking dollars.
[17:29.39]Oh my god.
[17:29.71]What if I go in the back door?
[17:32.87]What?! !
[18:02.11]God damn it, man.
[18:05.40]Well, it's alright.
[18:06.22]Now I know.
[18:07.66]It's fine.
[18:10.34]That's seriously... I couldn't believe... I got one hit killed.
[18:13.34]What do I have here that he's mad about?
[18:14.66]This is not stolen.
[18:18.18]Okay, this is stolen.
[18:19.53]I'm fucking just throwing this on the ground.
[18:24.31]I don't have any other shit that's stolen.
[18:28.62]Right?
[18:29.02]Food?
[18:29.70]Is it quest items?
[18:31.04]Other?
[18:31.34]Do I have anything else?
[18:32.72]No, I don't.
[18:38.26]So what's that guy's problem?
[18:42.87]This one's just bloody.
[18:45.09]The ring?
[18:45.65]The ring is not stolen.
[18:47.45]It doesn't have the icon on it.
[18:55.09]Just gonna leave that here.
[18:58.26]Oh my lord.
[18:59.06]Okay, well whatever.
[19:00.58]We have a second chance.
[19:05.24]He saw you drop the pants.
[19:07.85]Is there a fast travel I can do from here?
[19:13.69]Can't believe that shit.
[19:14.65]Alright, we're gonna go in like the back door this time.
[19:25.55]Or I'll just pay.
[19:26.27]It's like 30 bucks.
[19:30.37]Hey, Smokewise Ganja, thanks for the ten bucks here.
[19:34.61]My horse, my horse, my kingdom for a horse.
[19:37.35]What does that mean?
[19:37.89]Thank you.
[19:40.64]Okay, so I obviously have... I'm fine.
[19:44.00]Let's see if I can get behind this guy and sneak behind him.
[19:49.14]Alright, good.
[19:50.85]I snuck by the... Did you see how perfect that was?
[19:53.37]I snuck by the guard behind this guy.
[19:55.97]God, I'm fucking good.
[20:01.84]There we go.
[20:03.50]Alright, now we can... Go right to the... I want to sell some stuff.
[20:13.95]Archery range?
[20:14.79]No.
[20:20.09]I could learn a thing or two, right?
[20:24.15]Maybe.
[20:24.77]Where do I want to go?
[20:25.51]I just want to go up to the blacksmith or the... I need to sell.
[20:30.41]Let's just go sell.
[20:33.91]Did I just wash myself in the middle of town?
[20:36.62]Yeah.
[20:38.74]Dude, this is the middle ages, man.
[20:39.78]People used to dump their shit buckets out their windows onto the street.
[20:44.40]What I did was clean.
[20:45.40]Yeah, this is the middle ages, man.
[20:53.13]People used to puke out their windows.
[20:55.45]Like, right now, some guy would come out this window and hurl down here and all over the place.
[21:04.37]And you would just walk in it.
[21:06.07]That guy probably had the plague.
[21:07.55]That guy probably had a bunch of diseases.
[21:09.65]Some people would even put their asses out the window.
[21:11.09]Like, just two butt cheeks right there and just shit down here.
[21:15.58]And you'd be... It wasn't even gross back then.
[21:18.90]Here's the equivalent of what you would do back in those days when, like, somebody was hanging their ass out the window and, like, diarrhea-ing out the window.
[21:24.02]Like, you'd just be like this.
[21:25.06]You'd go like, oh, whoops.
[21:27.22]Watch out, man.
[21:27.90]Careful for that one.
[21:38.68]poop jokes LOL no that wasn't even that was a multi-layered bodily function joke that was not just a shit joke come on uh where am I going I want to go to the balloon bender this way um what the hell is it there it is alright sell

[22:12.03]Don't steal!
[22:13.63]I want to talk.
[22:14.29]Why is steal the first option?
[22:16.03]I want to talk to him.
[22:19.81]Let me walk into the place of business.
[22:22.03]Steal!
[22:22.73]No.
[22:23.31]God, why do I have to go around the counter?
[22:27.04]Jesus Christ be praised.
[22:29.28]Yes.
[22:29.78]Let's talk about trading.
[22:31.82]Sell.
[22:32.32]Alright, he's got a lot of money.
[22:33.22]Let's go to the most expensive thing I own.
[22:37.87]Wowie.
[22:39.79]176 bucks.
[22:41.71]I don't give a shit.
[22:42.33]I don't know.
[22:42.63]Sell them.
[22:45.96]Look at this ring.
[22:47.20]75 fucking cents.
[22:49.82]Wowie.
[22:50.12]You know what I'm saying?
[22:55.72]Let's get rid of the... I don't have the gloves right now.
[23:03.98]Hood.
[23:04.30]These working boots.
[23:05.29]They're broken.
[23:06.31]I don't want them anymore.
[23:10.51]What do I even have?
[23:11.19]I got so many of these.
[23:12.07]What are the... The best one I have.
[23:13.63]I got two of the... Put them both up there for auction.
[23:18.33]That one's currently the best.
[23:19.83]Sturdy.
[23:20.21]I got that all in all.
[23:21.03]It's kind of terrible, but... Tunic.
[23:24.55]Actually, I kind of want that.
[23:27.57]What about anything else?
[23:29.37]The silver ring.
[23:30.07]Should I just get rid of the ring?
[23:30.94]What do I have on for a helmet right now?
[23:37.58]I'm currently wearing...
[23:41.92]Check the basket for a second.
[23:42.98]Yeah, just get rid of these.
[23:44.58]Let's haggle.
[23:48.26]See if I can get more for this.
[23:50.96]If the horse has armor on him, I'll take it in a second.
[23:55.04]I want $2.45 for this.
[23:55.60]$2.35. $2.35.
[24:11.78]Hopefully Maple Story.
[24:18.88]That's the biggest transaction I've ever had.
[24:23.75]What about repair?
[24:24.41]Should I repair?
[24:25.77]I feel like I shouldn't even spend the money to repair.
[24:28.01]I'm just going to keep getting more stuff.
[24:33.63]I guess this leather gherkin is $3,000.
[24:41.18]Go to armor.
[24:42.94]Kettle hat is the most.
[24:44.06]I have hunter's gloves.
[24:46.60]I could sell these.
[24:47.26]I don't even need them.
[24:51.14]Steal a shield.
[24:53.66]Let's go look at the weapons.
[24:58.28]Is chat broken?
[24:59.00]It shouldn't be.
[24:59.42]Anybody have any gherkins?
[25:03.70]Oh, garlic?
[25:04.98]That's not garlic.
[25:06.28]It's like the head of a pineapple.
[25:13.23]Watermelon, apple, pear... Onion.
[25:17.89]That's not an onion.
[25:19.97]That's a radish.
[25:22.21]Cabbage.
[25:23.17]What are you selling here?
[25:24.27]Liar!
[25:28.97]Oh, what a dream I had!
[25:30.08]Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[25:33.30]Oh my god, what was it?
[25:34.74]It was a half... Hold on a second, this is important.
[25:36.62]Was it a half-dun?
[25:38.74]I think it was called a half-dun.
[25:40.79]Yep, it was.
[25:41.29]Okay, so I had a dream.
[25:43.11]Looked just like this.
[25:44.01]This is probably where it came from.
[25:45.69]So I had a dream last night that I was watching a cooking show.
[25:49.82]And this... This restaurant had something that they called a have-done.
[25:56.96]Right?
[25:57.16]Like H-A-V...
[25:59.53]Apostrophe D-U-N.
[26:01.35]I have done.
[26:02.53]And it was like Guy Fieri or something.
[26:04.59]Like diners driving through doing it.
[26:06.19]And it was cooked meat.
[26:08.15]It was half raw meat.
[26:10.11]Half cooked hamburger meat.
[26:12.35]Mixed together as like a flat patty.
[26:14.23]And they called it a half done.
[26:15.81]And I wanted to eat it.
[26:16.67]I don't know why.
[26:19.31]Like a half done.
[26:20.01]You know what I'm saying?
[26:21.99]It was just half raw, half browned ground beef.
[26:25.48]Flat.
[26:26.12]Like that.
[26:31.88]I don't know.
[26:32.32]I don't know what was wrong with me.
[26:40.79]It's like, what do we call this?
[26:41.65]We call it a half done.
[26:44.03]And they would mix it together with their hands.
[26:46.61]It was just gross browned meat with raw meat.
[26:50.60]And they just made it a flat patty and they put it on like a sandwich.
[26:56.98]Why am I breaking into somebody's house right now?
[27:03.09]What am I doing?
[27:03.53]Oh, I want to go to the... I was going to say the barber.
[27:06.27]No, I want to go to the fucking... The guy with the sword.
[27:09.48]This guy.
[27:11.18]Right to the left.
[27:16.31]It was probably about the rare steak thing the other day.
[27:18.19]Yeah, probably.
[27:23.89]Cut hair.
[27:24.41]Hey, good F. Let's talk about trade.
[27:29.25]Sell.
[27:30.67]Sell you this one.
[27:31.53]This one is $35.
[27:33.45]Take it.
[27:33.73]That's all I can do.
[27:35.89]Alright, now, do I... I don't care.
[27:40.17]Just close the deal.
[27:40.82]I want to look at what he has.
[27:41.74]Those of you guys that have a lot of time in this game, I'm at the point now where I have about $800.
[27:46.66]Is it stupid for me to buy...
[27:53.33]a fairly decent weapon here.
[27:58.88]Like for instance, get like one of these.
[28:02.20]Like the merchant's sword.
[28:03.32]This thing is better than what I currently use.
[28:06.02]Melee weapon, right?
[28:08.04]It's very dumb.
[28:14.65]Just don't.
[28:15.27]I just didn't know if that was a thing.
[28:16.61]For instance, get me like a comb.
[28:22.15]It's not dumb, just don't do it that often.
[28:23.65]For low level, it's not.
[28:26.55]I think I kind of have to get the comb.
[28:29.33]But is that really any better?
[28:32.09]Stab, 39, 55.
[28:32.49]What do I have on right now?
[28:36.90]39, but this thing's like not even that much worse.
[28:43.18]This thing's really not even worse.
[28:44.54]This thing's arguably probably better than what I have on, than, I mean...
[28:51.31]Yeah, I'm going to keep it.
[28:51.95]I'm just going to try to hold on to my money.
[28:57.73]Save it for armor.
[28:59.57]Yeah.
[29:00.19]What about the horse?
[29:00.99]People were telling me the horse is inventory, right?
[29:06.82]Where is the horse?
[29:07.60]There it is.
[29:09.12]Alright, let's pull this move to the inventory.
[29:10.86]Let's take this all off and sell it.
[29:19.44]Okay.
[29:21.23]Come back.
[29:21.65]I have another sword for you.
[29:22.53]Uh, burger sword.
[29:30.66]Sell it.
[29:30.96]That's all I can do right now.
[29:33.72]Check the basket.
[29:34.44]Close the deal.
[29:35.66]Ooh, that's a lot of money.
[29:37.48]Let's haggle this price.
[29:38.30]I want a hundred dollars.
[29:40.28]Steal all the swords off the table.
[29:48.18]And you probably can get away with it somehow.
[29:50.32]A half-done burger sword?
[29:52.14]There we go.
[29:53.26]Got it.
[29:53.72]77.
[29:53.76]Half-done burger sword.
[29:54.66]I'm going to go back to the armorer.
[30:00.14]Okay.
[30:17.14]And then we're going to move on to the next mission and maybe buy a piece of armor from this loser.
[30:27.26]Okay, we got lots of stuff.
[30:29.10]Okay, okay, okay.
[30:33.62]This.
[30:34.86]Got two of these.
[30:35.60]I need to put one of those on.
[30:37.62]I don't have any shoes on, so I think I'm going to hold on to these.
[30:40.38]Hunter's gloves.
[30:41.04]These are stolen, so I don't want to give them these.
[30:43.70]They're obviously the best ones that I currently have.
[30:45.55]Hunting boots.
[30:47.55]Give them the shittier ones.
[30:50.27]Get rid of these, too, because I'm going to put on the boots.
[30:54.10]Leather gloves.
[30:55.80]I think I have better.
[30:59.46]Yes, I do.
[31:03.29]And long sleeve.
[31:08.11]What do I have currently on?
[31:11.55]I think I already have this on.
[31:14.73]No, it's this one.
[31:15.75]Get rid of that.
[31:16.25]Get rid of that.
[31:22.11]Should I sell the ring?
[31:23.09]I'm going to just sell the ring.
[31:24.09]Who cares?
[31:24.53]That's currently what I have on.
[31:29.01]This is 9 and 31.
[31:30.03]9 and... No, this one's garbage.
[31:33.45]Get rid of it.
[31:36.65]Vambraces are these.
[31:38.75]These are worse.
[31:40.15]These are worse, so get rid of them.
[31:47.12]Tunic.
[31:48.52]No, worse.
[31:49.78]Working boots, worse.
[31:55.02]I think that's good.
[31:57.96]I could get rid of this.
[31:59.34]Yeah, get rid of this dumb thing.
[32:01.92]Check the basket.
[32:02.86]Haggle.
[32:05.13]Let's have a word about the price.
[32:07.69]Naturally.
[32:09.73]Let's see.
[32:10.09]Let's go.
[32:10.71]Let's really, really just try to get as much as we can here.
[32:13.13]I'm going right for like $430.
[32:15.91]What do you say to this?
[32:19.75]Alright, well, give me a better offer.
[32:23.71]Okay.
[32:24.05]405.
[32:24.79]Oh, fuck off.
[32:27.91]Oh, now I least- Oh, no, no, no!
[32:28.97]I have to do the whole thing again!
[32:29.90]Oh, god damn it!
[32:31.72]No, can I save my- Fucking hell.
[32:36.46]Okay, wha- God damn it.
[32:45.13]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:46.43]Go back to the basket.
[32:49.73]I can't sell him that.
[32:51.03]Uh, hunting boots.
[32:54.85]Give him the dirty ones.
[32:55.87]Leather gloves.
[32:56.56]Give him, yeah.
[32:58.28]This dumb thing.
[32:59.18]God damn it.
[33:00.70]This time I'm not going to be so greedy.
[33:02.00]What do I have for boots?
[33:06.44]I don't think I even have shoes on anymore.
[33:12.09]No, I got these boots here.
[33:13.25]Okay.
[33:14.99]Alright.
[33:15.81]I got brown hoes, patched hoes.
[33:17.65]These ones are more expensive.
[33:18.67]Just take them.
[33:20.49]Check the basket.
[33:22.73]Haggle.
[33:24.62]This time I'm not going to be greedy.
[33:29.56]Let's go to four.
[33:30.48]Now let's start at 405.
[33:31.36]Now I'm just going to match them.
[33:39.82]Yeah, I don't care.
[33:41.85]I'll go for that.
[33:44.81]Don't reward incomplete Jupiters.
[33:47.17]Okay.
[33:49.53]Now, do I buy one of these sweet, sweet pieces of gear?
[34:03.61]Okay.
[34:04.89]$5,000.
[34:04.91]24 defense.
[34:05.45]These are great.
[34:05.89]Alright.
[34:06.44]Let's see.
[34:07.06]What do I have?
[34:08.18]1.2k.
[34:11.95]1k.
[34:12.19]Alright, let's look at the cheap shit.
[34:13.93]What's on sale?
[34:18.20]You got any good sales for me?
[34:19.94]This is 10.
[34:20.22]It's currently better than what I have on.
[34:23.50]What about the scaly skullcap?
[34:27.72]No, this stuff is all garbage.
[34:30.56]Not worth it.
[34:33.80]No, it's just not worth it.
[34:34.44]It really isn't.
[34:36.65]Now let's go sell all my rotten food to someone.
[34:40.37]Like this lady.
[34:41.45]How much money does this lady have?
[34:44.98]Cheap shit is better on dead bodies.
[34:46.42]Yeah, that's true.
[34:48.90]Okay.
[34:50.54]Food.
[34:51.36]I got 20 apples.
[34:54.77]I'll give you 10.
[34:55.21]This trader only has 40 bucks?
[34:59.67]What?
[34:59.91]How do you only have $40?
[35:05.03]Wow, business is rough, huh?
[35:12.86]Keeping the mead.
[35:14.40]Can have five onions.
[35:15.86]Let's just, let's just drain her whole bank account.
[35:17.64]What do you say?
[35:25.90]Get rid of these beets.
[35:28.48]I don't want to go over. 30.
[35:36.33]36.
[35:36.35]Alright, we'll go with that.
[35:38.97]Let's haggle.
[35:40.17]And let's drain her bank account.
[35:41.89]I want to leave her with not one cent.
[35:45.05]Can we do the price?
[35:46.73]Let's haggle a little bit here.
[35:47.89]Ma'am, I would like literally every... Wait.
[35:54.74]Am I getting fucking...
[36:02.05]I was gonna pay more money.
[36:04.25]Wow, that would have been bad.
[36:05.41]I was just gonna haggle to buy them for more money.
[36:09.97]Holy shit.
[36:12.83]Wow.
[36:14.43]If that system was the same for selling and buying, I would have just bought those for more money.
[36:19.79]But you have to go up when you're buying, rather than down.
[36:22.77]Wow, okay.
[36:28.59]Holy shit, man.
[36:30.33]Get it together.
[36:35.70]Let's get rid of all this bacon.
[36:37.86]All the gross shit.
[36:39.31]All the hair meat that's at zero.
[36:40.89]It's you a problem now.
[36:47.61]Buying a bunch of rotten food.
[36:50.51]The Wolf of Wall Street.
[36:52.89]Oh man, oh man.
[36:55.74]Uh, dried meat.
[36:56.70]I want to keep this.
[36:58.80]Stays for longer.
[36:59.60]Drinking water.
[37:01.66]That's fine.
[37:06.11]Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[37:07.39]Let's just close the deal.
[37:10.07]What other, like, junk do I have?
[37:13.90]Let me take a look at my inventories.
[37:15.16]See, I got 84 out of 109.
[37:15.96]What do I have?
[37:16.42]What am I holding that's just junk?
[37:19.90]That just weighs a lot.
[37:22.50]It's a swap by weight.
[37:23.28]What do we got here?
[37:27.36]Go back up.
[37:29.42]So the heaviest things that I own are... I got... Boar hide.
[37:32.20]Move to the horse.
[37:38.34]Put the boots on.
[37:40.56]Move the deer hide to the horse.
[37:44.11]Move the sheepskin to the horse.
[37:45.57]Van braces.
[37:46.27]Okay.
[37:52.32]Door keys.
[37:53.16]These are all, like, nonsense.
[37:54.76]Alright, I'm good.
[37:57.90]Hunter's gloves.
[37:58.60]Move to the horse.
[38:04.72]And that's the way we're gonna do it.
[38:06.72]Now, we gotta look at skill points for just a second to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[38:10.12]Ah, ah, ah, didn't, okay.
[38:12.90]Time to, hey, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stream.
[38:16.33]Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[38:18.15]Been streaming for 40 minutes, and I'm ready to start to play the game.
[38:21.33]Okay, let's go to the next mission here.
[38:22.85]Oh, hey, watch out for this guy.
[38:23.85]Whoa, hey, Mustard Man.
[38:27.39]Hey, what do you got on you, man?
[38:28.98]Show me what you've got concealed.
[38:32.03]Huh?
[38:32.41]What the fuck are you talking about?
[38:36.19]No, you're fucking up my YouTube joke.
[38:38.05]Why?
[38:38.59]What?
[38:40.08]I don't have anything.
[38:40.96]Oh my god.
[38:49.51]I don't even know what I have.
[38:56.79]What do I have?
[38:58.95]I don't think I have anything.
[39:00.29]Do I?
[39:00.77]Didn't I just get rid of everything?
[39:03.03]I got rid of my hunter's gloves, they're on the horse now.
[39:04.95]I can- I've been here the whole time!
[39:09.97]What did he take?
[39:10.69]I don't know, what did you even take?
[39:27.06]He didn't take anything.
[39:30.34]They check the horse.
[39:35.08]Go fuck yourself.
[39:40.30]Alright.
[39:41.54]Let's begin the next part of the game.
[39:43.99]I've got food.
[39:44.81]I've got water.
[39:45.63]I'm well rested.
[39:49.61]We can go to a few different places here.
[39:53.31]Let's make the... Okay, Talenberg.
[39:54.81]Let's make the trek over here.
[39:57.17]Fast travel.
[40:04.91]Why would I not even try the speech roll?
[40:06.25]Because then wouldn't I have to pay money?
[40:10.12]I fail every time with the speech roll.
[40:12.38]I mean, I'm not sure if you've watched the last couple of streams, but I've played the secret agent roll like 12 times, and it has failed every single time.
[40:19.87]And then I have to pay 60 bucks.
[40:26.39]Do you have enough have-nots?
[40:29.96]I'm gonna starve on the way there.
[40:31.86]Uh-oh!
[40:35.16]Wayfarer!
[40:35.88]We got an event!
[40:36.98]Examine!
[40:39.46]What is it?
[40:44.78]Well, you... Okay.
[40:45.64]Hi.
[40:49.80]I think this is just a little town.
[40:51.92]For me to rest my weary head.
[41:00.31]Alright, what town is this?
[41:04.25]Fast travel point.
[41:06.15]Can I buy a bed?
[41:06.95]There's a butcher.
[41:10.27]I need a bed.
[41:19.25]Wait, is... This is literally town... Why did a YouTuber just say hey to me?
[41:33.91]This is literally Talenberg.
[41:36.27]Okay.
[41:39.71]Oh, we got like a little town here.
[41:42.62]Hey!
[41:47.32]What's wrong?
[41:48.20]Does my reputation precede me?
[41:51.92]How are you?
[41:53.38]Why do you ask?
[41:53.84]Why do you ask?
[42:01.68]I'm going to give her a diamond ring.
[42:04.38]At your service.
[42:06.04]Now she is... The lady of the castle is... Where, where, where, where, where?
[42:08.34]Where is that?
[42:09.30]That's not here.
[42:09.64]What the heck?
[42:30.77]Talk to Stephanie.
[42:34.05]Yeah?
[42:35.09]Well, you're going to have to wait until the morning.
[42:36.47]I need to eat something and go to bed.
[42:43.91]It's a graveyard here.
[42:45.91]Where's that bed?
[42:49.92]Up here.
[42:51.66]Your bed.
[42:56.22]Okay.
[42:57.46]I guess I have a bed here.
[42:59.81]Legit missed the castle on the map.
[43:01.47]It's right here!
[43:02.03]So, alright, I'm gonna go into... That's my bed.
[43:05.07]Is my bed the castle?
[43:11.94]That's my castle.
[43:14.40]I own this place.
[43:20.28]We have to go to, like, this person's bed.
[43:22.63]Alright, where's the entrance?
[43:24.61]If I was an entrance, I'd probably be over here.
[43:29.85]I need to be light out first before I do anything.
[43:36.26]This is the room I got in the prologue.
[43:39.46]Come on, that was like 40 hours ago.
[43:41.22]Alright, I need to go up through the front.
[43:52.17]What are you doing, horse?
[44:00.05]You can get up there!
[44:01.23]Come on, shortcut!
[44:03.09]Shortcut, yes!
[44:06.21]I need my torch out, right?
[44:12.81]Hello!
[44:14.97]Good morning!
[44:20.02]The horse is allowed in here, right?
[44:25.66]Is the horse allowed inside buildings?
[44:31.23]I don't think I, uh... I'm not sure this is supposed to be a thing.
[44:39.21]But at least it makes me move around faster.
[44:40.73]I just want to see if I can get him through the doors.
[44:42.61]Can he come in the house with me?
[44:47.39]I want him to come in my house.
[44:56.82]Lockpick, fuck.
[45:01.54]Let's just go into the house and go to bed.
[45:03.12]I didn't think I was going this fast.
[45:09.07]Like, sprinting around the battlements.
[45:13.89]Whoa!
[45:17.27]Easy.
[45:21.46]Oh, fuck.
[45:21.90]Oh.
[45:26.91]I'm in a private area!
[45:29.61]Oh shit!
[45:30.73]Alright, get down there!
[45:35.52]You can almost fit, come on!
[45:44.20]Alright, that's fine, you can stay here.
[45:50.18]Oh fuck.
[45:50.78]Alright, he's gonna be okay, right?
[45:57.81]That's not good.
[45:58.41]What if I whistle now?
[45:59.67]Oh, fuck, I'm, like, down in the basement.
[46:02.19]Get... You, of course, can't get here.
[46:08.00]Come on, boy, you can do it!
[46:09.20]Oh, well.
[46:13.34]Where the fuck am I?
[46:14.17]No, I gotta go back up.
[46:15.65]Fuck.
[46:18.99]Wait a minute.
[46:21.03]Um...
[46:24.25]I think I may have just caused myself a large amount of problems.
[46:27.75]I can't get back up here.
[46:31.25]Oh yeah, I can.
[46:31.77]Just mount him.
[46:34.75]Alright, it's time for bed.
[46:36.07]It's time for bed.
[46:36.67]Get off the horse.
[46:40.15]Just get me the fuck out of here.
[46:41.13]I need to go.
[46:41.75]Just go to bed.
[46:42.37]Go to bed.
[46:42.67]Where's my bed?
[46:43.32]Go to bed.
[46:45.98]I'm like dicking around too much.
[46:47.44]Go to sleep.
[46:47.92]It's right over here.
[46:56.76]Goodnight.
[46:57.08]I hope he's alright.
[47:07.34]Just forget that happened.
[47:10.36]Am I learning how to read?
[47:13.81]What's going on with the reading thing?
[47:16.43]I need to eat.
[47:18.75]Anybody have a free soup?
[47:24.26]You never eat... Don't ever use your own food in this game.
[47:28.25]Like I'm about to.
[47:29.03]Alright, let's eat some dried meat.
[47:36.79]Eat the pretzel.
[47:38.63]Eat these apples.
[47:39.37]I need a couple of dried mushrooms.
[47:43.79]Have another dried meat.
[47:44.79]And time for bed.
[47:50.09]Take your shoes off.
[47:51.39]I can't control that.
[47:57.86]I just ate dog food.
[48:04.06]No, I ate human dog food.
[48:06.40]What's the difference?
[48:15.29]You can take off your shoes.
[48:16.41]Why would I do that?
[48:17.21]It's a waste of time.
[48:23.19]Who sleeps in full armor?
[48:26.57]It's a video game.
[48:27.75]We're... We're led to believe that he did take all of his clothes off.
[48:35.66]That's what we're led to believe.
[48:36.74]Put the torch down.
[48:37.50]It's night.
[48:40.52]Wait.
[48:41.06]Is it not daytime?
[48:43.94]It's like 6 in the morning.
[48:48.37]I'm sure there are people that really roleplay the hell out of this and they take off all their clothes.
[48:52.45]Turn all the lights off.
[48:56.47]Alright, let's go see the queen.
[49:00.93]Is my horse okay?
[49:02.99]Uh-oh.
[49:08.15]Oh no, that's actually a really bad sign, isn't it?
[49:10.79]Wait.
[49:12.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:23.59]Can he typically get here?
[49:32.27]He'll be alright.
[49:33.89]Eventually.
[49:34.33]Alright, so where are the queen's chambers?
[49:42.75]Go see the queen.
[49:45.73]Is she just up here in the tower or something?
[49:49.54]It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[49:50.92]Like, where is she?
[49:51.46]That's fine, just go ahead.
[50:04.60]Alright, where's the queen?
[50:14.22]Get the hell out of here.
[50:15.24]There's nothing here for you.
[50:18.83]Okay, sorry.
[50:20.69]Sorry, I didn't mean to.
[50:21.79]Alright, bye.

[51:18.25]Go talk to Stephanie and give her the ring.
[51:25.41]Why is simple things so difficult?
[51:26.76]Because I'm using a different control scheme.
[51:31.82]Like that's something I've never had to do this whole time.
[51:37.64]My horse is fine.
[51:39.64]There he is.
[51:44.09]Where am I going?
[51:44.73]What are you talking about?

[51:51.41]Wait, there's a different A. Why are there two A's?
[51:59.13]Why, there's another A.

[52:11.36]No, sorry, it's a different A. It's this A. Get off.
[52:24.95]She's in here somewhere.
[52:30.29]It's a different battery.
[52:31.63]It's the single A battery.

[52:41.87]Is she lying on the ground?
[52:47.79]What about up here?
[52:53.26]Maybe she's up a little bit higher.
[52:55.80]Stephanie?
[52:59.04]Stephanie?
[53:00.82]Oh, there you are.
[53:01.36]I found you.
[53:05.81]God save.
[53:06.79]Can I help you with anything?
[53:08.57]Yeah, can you change the naming scheme of side quests so they're not the same letter?
[53:13.00]I heard you wanted to talk to me, my lady.
[53:15.24]It's true.
[53:16.16]I need something from you.
[53:17.58]How can I help?
[53:19.85]My cousin, young Sophie, is going to be wed.
[53:23.37]It will be an entry into a new life, and I want everything to be perfect for her.
[53:28.16]I'm looking for a few things to give her as a gift, and you're going to find them for me.
[53:33.10]My lady, why me?
[53:35.94]Normally I'd let the Chamberlain take care of it, but he doesn't have any taste.
[53:41.11]Sure.
[53:41.33]Um... No.
[53:41.53]I'm not doing a fetch quest right now.
[53:43.63]Okay.
[54:12.04]I've heard you're capable of anything.
[54:22.21]Nah, not really.
[54:24.53]Actually, the complete opposite.
[54:26.61]Oh.
[54:27.89]Okay.
[54:30.76]Not all that for nothing.
[54:34.08]Alright, let's go... Let's do the thing I wanted to do.
[54:36.32]Let's go do the thing.
[54:37.60]This thing.
[54:39.18]Bingo.
[54:40.48]Let's go to this A.
[54:51.31]Am I gonna be alright?
[55:00.48]Alright, I think I'm gonna be fine.
[55:04.46]I just rolled around like a four-year-old having a tantrum in the clothing store.
[55:15.25]Alright, on to A.
[55:33.93]Capture objective A. The guards are gonna tell the other guards and they're all gonna laugh at you.
[55:39.40]Eh, whatever.
[55:42.32]Make sure this is the correct A. Point of least resistance.
[55:53.31]Straight line.
[56:02.66]Alright, take a break after that one.
[56:06.48]Alright.
[56:08.52]Look, we made it.
[56:12.23]Why are they running from me?
[56:15.69]Why are they running away from me?
[56:16.69]What did I do?
[56:17.93]I just did such a cool move.
[56:19.23]Why would you be running from me?
[56:23.46]I don't know.
[56:23.84]What did he say?
[56:24.28]Oh, these are hostiles.
[56:27.22]These are hostiles.
[56:27.96]Hostile!
[56:28.76]Horse.
[56:29.16]Hostile.
[56:29.66]Hostile!
[56:33.44]Get off the horse!
[56:35.48]Oh shit!
[56:36.00]No, I don't want to shoot the bow!
[56:40.81]Fuck.
[56:45.93]Oh, he's grabbing me?
[56:47.85]Does that guy not have a weapon?
[56:49.27]Oh, fuck you.
[56:58.68]Alright, give me... What do you got?
[57:05.94]Ooh, what's this?
[57:08.38]What else you got on you?
[57:10.82]I'm gonna take his ear off?
[57:12.71]Why would I do that?
[57:13.31]He's got a lot of money too.
[57:19.49]Alright.
[57:19.71]Let's raid this whole camp.
[57:24.88]I need lockpicks.
[57:25.66]I keep not having them.
[57:29.50]Anything else here?
[57:30.52]Any food and shit I can probably eat?
[57:35.29]They were cooking something.
[57:36.11]That guy was naked that left.
[57:37.29]Alright, now let's take care of this fire.
[57:47.98]Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
[57:56.87]They poisoned their wine.
[57:57.99]That's fucked up.
[57:59.71]Now, I gotta get out of here.
[58:00.59]Alright, Pebbles, let's go.
[58:08.58]Back this way.
[58:09.12]I just made some money.
[58:12.50]It's not considered stealing if you get attacked first, right?
[58:15.72]Is it?
[58:16.72]What's the law there?
[58:17.36]Alright, if some guy just runs after me with like a knife in his hand, and he starts like swinging at me and slashing at me, and I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
[58:26.13]Eventually, like, I disarm him.
[58:28.13]And like, I kill him, right?
[58:30.07]Like, we're talking medieval times.
[58:32.67]If I take all of his stuff as that stealing...
[58:39.63]Wait, missed a chest.
[58:40.61]Missed a chest.
[58:43.23]I can't open it.
[58:44.01]I probably don't have a lockpick.
[58:46.23]Missed chest?
[58:52.75]I probably can't even open the thing.
[58:55.59]No, you guys are fucking with me.
[58:57.19]There's no chest.
[59:00.41]It wasn't locked.
[59:02.23]You guys are fucking with me right now.
[59:03.63]Don't you dare tell me that there was a chest here.
[59:06.65]There are no chests in this game.
[59:16.74]And plus, I don't even know what the hell that was.
[59:18.30]I have no idea what that was.
[59:26.66]Just kidding.
[59:33.87]Alright, where's this chest that exists here?
[59:36.43]There's a chest... God damn it.
[59:38.09]Now I have to deal with this guy.
[59:39.07]That guy's got cool shit on him though.
[59:47.36]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:55.38]Why are you punching me?
[60:00.50]That guy's not gonna hit me.
[60:03.90]What are you fucking idiots doing?
[60:07.26]Why are you doing this?
[60:10.48]Fuck off.
[60:11.14]You're not gonna punch my horse, dude.
[60:12.38]Sorry.
[60:12.68]I ain't gonna let you fucking get away with that one.
[60:18.20]Oh, give up.
[60:19.42]Give up.
[60:20.50]Give up.
[60:22.55]Where's your weapon?
[60:23.55]The fuck are you thinking?
[60:26.65]This guy's just... This is not fair.
[60:33.69]This is like when your older brother fights you and he's in like... It's a pillow fight and he's wearing like the hockey pads.
[60:39.01]It's not fair.
[60:45.99]Alright, they're both done.
[60:51.87]Hey, hey, hey!
[60:52.94]Hey!
[60:55.88]Hey!
[60:56.26]No way!
[60:58.32]No.
[60:58.88]I need that.
[60:59.22]I want this guy's stuff.
[61:07.77]Shit!
[61:20.30]I didn't... How did that not hit him?
[61:27.40]This is so dumb.
[61:28.18]Alright, get fucking over here.
[61:30.10]Come here!
[61:30.64]This guy's gonna run out of fucking breath.
[62:08.08]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[62:15.35]Oh, this guy's got a lot of good shit on him.
[62:18.41]Oh, man.
[62:18.93]I'm gonna be overburdened.
[62:22.94]He had money.
[62:23.82]He had a cumin cafe.
[62:27.88]Who's this guy?
[62:28.54]Who's Red Priest?
[62:36.92]I'm just chasing this guy around.
[62:38.67]And this dude is just like, ah, whatever.
[62:40.15]I'm the little brother.
[62:45.57]I didn't get the hockey pads in our pillow fight.
[62:47.47]That's bullshit.
[62:48.29]Alright, who are you?
[62:49.43]Who's this random guy?
[62:54.18]What?
[62:58.06]What?
[63:16.49]You got anything on you?
[63:18.33]I'm going to take his money.
[63:26.56]I don't even know.
[63:27.32]Guys, you want me to go back and get the chest?
[63:31.60]No, I didn't mean to do that.
[63:33.18]My mistake cost that guy $5.
[63:38.22]I'm not going to find the chest.
[63:40.26]You think I'm going to find the chest after that?
[63:41.95]I don't even know what direction I'm facing.
[63:48.23]He didn't even see my face.
[63:49.05]Alright, it's right there.
[63:54.09]Alright, where's the chest?
[63:57.63]The chest.
[63:59.11]We're back in the camp.
[63:59.95]Oh, come on.
[64:04.53]Can I talk to him?
[64:06.23]Talk.
[64:06.95]What's the talk?
[64:08.23]Is there a talk?
[64:08.85]Is there a diplomacy?
[64:10.67]What's diplomacy?
[64:11.37]This is the same guy.
[64:12.95]Look, can we talk?
[64:14.91]I want to do diplomacy!
[64:17.71]I'm doing sign language!
[64:20.73]Do you understand?
[64:21.25]Alright, do you understand now?
[64:37.54]That rabbit is fucking huge!
[64:39.98]Wait a minute!
[64:40.90]Look at how big that fucking rabbit is!
[64:44.68]That's the biggest rabbit I've ever seen.
[64:46.65]I don't care anymore about this guy.
[64:48.81]That is seriously... That's a dog.
[64:52.65]Put this away.
[64:53.09]I don't care.
[64:56.85]I need to find the dog-sized rabbit again.
[65:04.67]God, they'll be writing National Geographic articles about me.
[65:11.86]I'm going to slow down.
[65:14.14]He'll stop eventually.
[65:14.88]I lost him in the trees.
[65:19.61]There he is.
[65:23.43]Why are you still following me?
[65:26.03]You're really fucking this up.
[65:27.15]I lost it.
[65:28.25]Thanks a lot, buddy.
[65:30.49]Me and you could have been on the fucking front cover.
[65:53.77]Where's my horse?
[65:55.31]I can't even move.
[66:00.00]I've got some stuff to give you, horse.
[66:06.38]Move to horse.
[66:11.33]That thing's pretty cool.
[66:14.85]Yellow bow.
[66:15.63]No, it's worse.
[66:18.95]Any of these things are better than what I currently have on.
[66:21.47]This.
[66:22.83]Yes, I'm gonna wear this.
[66:25.26]I'm gonna be the gray bullet bill.
[66:32.00]Wow, I really made out like... I made out like a bandit.
[66:35.76]Like a true bandit.
[66:42.43]Eight versus... what do I have on now?
[66:46.33]No, that thing's better.
[66:47.09]Move this to the horse, though.
[66:50.88]Move it to the horse.
[66:54.53]This is better.
[67:00.21]Human riding boots?
[67:03.09]Wow, this is great.
[67:05.77]I got a new harness?
[67:07.99]Ooh.
[67:14.27]Alright.
[67:16.42]Riding breeches?
[67:17.82]Sure.
[67:19.74]Slippers?
[67:26.34]No, the thing's broken.
[67:28.72]Check the durability.
[67:29.36]Yeah, the durability is kind of bad, but it's alright.
[67:31.76]It's still enough for like a little while.
[67:36.46]Plus the horse has got it.
[67:37.28]It's fine.
[67:37.60]Alright, what about like food and shit?
[67:40.52]They had a lot of food.
[67:41.34]They had a lot of random stuff.
[67:42.40]Human ears.

[68:10.38]What are you doing?
[68:37.84]Alright, archery might be impossible.
[68:41.38]What?
[68:41.56]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

[69:26.47]Just pick them up.
[69:27.23]Oh, my God.
[69:27.73]Pick these arrows up, for the love of Christ.
[69:34.59]Pick up the fucking arrows, man.
[69:40.19]These ones are lost forever.
[69:40.95]I don't care.
[69:47.21]Alright, chest.

[72:05.74]So, the link gone wild.

[72:10.99]Alright, let's go find the limp guy.
[72:15.73]He's just in the town somewhere.
[72:17.11]Maybe we can get some more information?
[72:21.05]Let's go ahead and saddle up the horse in the middle of the road.
[72:23.20]Who cares about danger?
[72:24.36]Has the guy got a limp?
[72:34.76]Father Godwyn.
[72:35.66]Okay.
[72:36.50]What's he doing?
[72:37.00]Easy.
[72:39.66]Thank you.
[72:39.92]Who can teach me how to read?
[72:40.82]This is a dev by the way.
[72:41.88]Guaranteed.
[73:05.24]I see you know how to wield a sword.
[73:07.12]Guaranteed.
[73:07.94]I wouldn't have expected that from a man of the cloth.
[73:10.32]With a stick.
[73:11.76]I practice with a stick.
[73:14.27]A reminder of my youth and days gone by.
[73:16.97]And it helps keep me in good form.
[73:18.35]Yeah, I'm certain.
[73:22.01]Alright, you got any work?
[73:24.79]My dear lad, I have more worries than I can bear.
[73:29.13]My dear lad.
[73:30.15]I have to deal with a local witch.
[73:32.29]A witch?
[73:34.35]I'm gonna paint you a picture here.
[74:01.90]So what I picture is I picture an older male in a booth in a studio that it's just kind of like we need an extra actor we need like four can you do like four or five voices for us?
[74:11.39]I see a almost like a Santa Claus looking older man like a kind of a big white beard glasses are down on the bridge of his nose all the way down holding the script up in his hand with one light
[74:24.94]Down on his face.
[74:26.04]You know, kind of like there's a handy cam outside the studio.
[74:28.78]He's looking down, just reading the script into the microphone.
[74:34.76]Just glasses down, head down.
[74:36.36]Okay, let's do this one.
[74:37.97]Take, okay, go.
[74:39.63]Talk.
[74:41.15]I see that.
[74:42.09]I want to be that guy.
[74:43.47]A little girl told you today.
[74:45.75]You know how good people are at seeing the splinter in another's eye and not the beam in their own.
[74:50.37]In other words, someone's been gossiping.
[74:54.38]I don't care, bye.
[74:55.80]Whoa, easy!
[75:04.05]Oh, right, he's... Let me show you my form!
[75:11.71]You actually put on Batman face.
[75:15.93]This is actually why.
[75:19.45]You look through the eyes of a butterfly.
[75:24.11]Do you take the helmet off too?
[75:26.09]Yeah, you do.
[75:26.49]Alright, let's go.
[75:29.99]Where did he say he was?
[75:31.09]He was down here.
[75:32.41]I'm not going to kill that guy.
[75:37.32]He didn't do anything.
[76:02.20]Pillary.
[76:02.56]Can you eventually put people in there or get stuck in there yourself?
[76:07.04]Kill.
[76:07.48]No, I'm not going to kill that guy.
[76:09.04]He didn't do anything.
[76:18.33]Ironically, I'll kill that lady, though.
[76:20.25]For no reason.
[76:21.23]Don't ask me why.
[76:21.85]Is this still Pebble?
[76:27.01]Yes, it is.
[76:27.37]Alright, he's in this house.
[76:28.73]Pebble, stay up here.
[76:36.24]Oh, okay.
[76:42.57]Commotion.
[76:47.43]What happened?
[76:47.95]That guy doesn't have a limp.
[76:56.34]He's dead.
[76:57.06]Move along, citizens.
[77:01.77]Move along.
[77:03.05]There's nothing to see here.
[77:05.58]If that's what you call nothing to see, I'd like to know what something to see looks like.
[77:11.20]Here, here.
[77:13.86]By the keys of St.
[77:14.84]Peter, this is all I need.
[77:17.76]We'll have to send word to Sir Hanush.
[77:19.52]That might not be necessary.
[77:21.54]Who are you?
[77:22.94]I'm Henry of Scalitz, in the service of Hanush's Captain Bernard.
[77:27.37]I'm investigating the attack at Neuhof, and I think this could be... Why do you guys think I look bad?
[77:31.89]Well, I'm the bailiff of Auschitz.
[77:34.78]And I say we don't want any of that kind of trouble around here.
[77:37.48]What makes you think this has anything to do with Neuhof?
[77:42.04]One of the folk at the stud farm recognized someone from Auschwitz among the bandits.
[77:45.10]What am I wearing?
[77:45.76]What are you talking?
[77:47.58]I look good.
[77:48.88]Do you think the guy on the left looks good?
[77:50.26]Because we're wearing the same outfit except mine's cooler looking.
[77:54.40]Shit.
[77:56.83]Allow me to introduce you to Limpy Lubosch.
[78:04.06]Or all that's left of him.
[78:09.58]I'm doing the double dress.
[78:12.96]What the fuck?
[78:16.37]This game just took like a really gross, gory turn.
[78:22.07]Nothing's ever easy.
[78:24.05]When did this become a horror game?
[78:26.73]I'll have to take a look around and ask a few more questions.
[78:29.37]If that's alright with you.
[78:31.78]It's another investigation quest.
[78:33.60]Find out more about Limpy Lubosch.
[78:35.68]Who was he?
[78:59.69]I don't want to do more detective work.
[79:01.35]Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[79:01.97]L.A.
[79:02.05]Noire edition.
[79:03.82]I'm too surprised what happened to him.
[79:22.27]He kept company with all sorts of vermin.
[79:24.75]He was always getting into some kind of trouble.
[79:27.20]Punch-ups in the tavern and what have you.
[79:29.68]I need to play that game.
[79:32.68]What relevance does this have?
[79:33.78]How come he limped?
[79:36.02]He got that from some villainy or brawl a long time ago.
[79:40.13]Okay.
[79:41.77]Has he been up to anything suspicious lately?
[79:45.58]Do it in VR?
[79:46.96]Yeah, why not?
[79:47.74]I will.
[79:47.92]I'll do it in VR.
[79:49.34]We should do that soon.
[79:50.30]Play this game in VR.
[79:52.40]What?
[79:52.58]That would be terrible.
[79:53.30]The game's quiet?
[79:54.62]I'll turn it up.
[79:56.34]That should be better.
[80:17.11]Did he have any cronies?
[80:18.47]I love that word.
[80:19.43]Crony.
[80:23.97]Alright, that's thanks for the information.
[80:35.17]Now everybody scream at the same time.
[80:39.60]No one's rated me?
[80:42.40]Why is everybody freaking out?
[80:48.78]There, see?
[80:52.62]Okay, I'll do that now.
[80:54.34]I just wanted to make sure I got a reaction for my YouTube video.
[81:04.95]I just need to investigate.
[81:08.26]What else we got?
[81:09.74]What else we got?
[81:15.32]There is no track for this one.
[81:16.82]It's just... I just have to do this.
[81:24.15]I need to wash more people's clothes.
[81:27.17]What?
[81:28.79]Where were you?
[81:29.87]Where were you, Head Groom?
[81:33.29]Good day to you.
[81:35.16]Did you know much about that man?
[81:36.62]I've come in the name of Sir Hannish of Leiper.
[81:40.17]I'm investigating the massacre in Neuhof, and now a murder here as well.
[81:43.77]Of course, ask away.
[81:46.93]Where were you?
[81:47.91]This guy is the guy I'm going to lock away.
[81:50.85]Have you noticed anything suspicious recently?
[81:52.51]Well, now I think of it, I hadn't seen him around for a while.
[81:55.87]No idea where he was skulking.
[82:01.23]I'm going to go investigate the actual... Am I allowed inside, or is it like the police, you're not allowed to go in there?
[82:09.26]Is it one of those scenarios?
[82:10.10]Isn't he just in here?
[82:11.22]What?
[82:11.34]We're just going to leave him in here?
[82:14.61]What the?
[82:15.29]Why have we not taken him down yet?
[82:18.85]He's just going to be in here like this.
[82:20.29]No, don't worry.
[82:20.85]Just leave him here.
[82:23.77]Sure.
[82:24.87]An inscription in blood.
[82:27.22]Pity I don't know how to read.
[82:28.00]It looks like they wanted to give someone a warning.
[82:31.34]But who?
[82:32.82]They wanted to give somebody a warning.
[82:33.70]The fact that he knows how to write isn't something you see every day.
[82:37.75]I don't know how to read.
[82:39.63]Does this change if you know how to read?
[82:41.31]Shrave.
[82:44.15]Shrate.
[82:49.51]Should have learned how to read.
[82:51.26]Head.
[82:51.52]Seven days.
[82:53.22]Oh my god.
[83:06.76]Lord above, they did a hell of a job on him.
[83:09.82]Must have been agony.
[83:11.66]How come no one heard anything?
[83:13.98]Go learn how to read and come back.
[83:15.31]Okay, so remember what that says.
[83:16.29]It says Zerail.
[83:19.11]Anything else?
[83:22.51]No.
[83:22.81]Alright, let's go learn to read and we'll come back.
[83:25.77]But first, let me investigate the rest of the house.
[83:27.41]There might be some evidence here.
[83:31.81]I still have not bought lockpicks.
[83:40.22]I'll give you a break, guys.
[83:40.84]He ain't going to be eating this.
[83:44.48]Nothing here.
[83:46.32]How could you do that?
[83:46.98]He's not going to be eating it.
[83:58.17]Just go quickly, learn how to read.
[84:01.45]Seven Zerai.
[84:08.08]Food is evidence.
[84:10.55]Yep, gotta taste it.
[84:13.57]I'm gonna sneeze.
[84:14.73]I'm sorry!
[84:15.83]Alright, where do we go from here?
[84:20.62]I'm gonna go learn to read.
[84:22.18]It's gonna happen again.
[84:22.80]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[84:23.60]I'm so sorry.
[84:24.10]It's gonna happen again.
[84:24.68]That hurt.
[84:43.25]Let's go learn how to read.
[84:44.33]Did somebody just call me a dork?
[84:50.49]Did you just call me a dork?
[84:53.57]Give me a fucking break.
[84:56.70]Huh.
[84:57.50]So, we are... This is a huge town.
[85:04.30]So, we need to remember this spot because that's where the house is where the guy is.
[85:08.02]We need to go learn how to read.
[85:10.31]Visit the scribe.
[85:11.11]We're going to go to green A. Or just fast travel because it's right here.
[85:21.25]Green A. Oh, my nose.
[85:33.48]There it is.
[85:34.42]Get off.
[85:42.32]Just talk to townspeople.
[85:43.18]Yeah, but I want to do this first.
[85:45.46]I feel like learning to read is an important thing in this game.
[85:48.10]So you can read the one thing on the wall that you need to read.
[85:51.02]Alright.
[85:54.23]There he is.
[85:54.63]I was sent here.
[86:02.21]I'd like to learn how to read.
[86:03.03]You.
[86:07.16]You don't look like the makings of a priest or clerk.
[86:09.50]It's pretty useful.
[86:10.65]Let's get it out of the way.
[86:12.35]What is it, like a mini-game?
[86:13.87]Bear in mind, it won't be all that easy.
[86:15.55]It's just like a rhythm mini-game.
[86:17.59]It should be easy.
[86:20.71]Alright.
[86:21.95]I don't want to waste time.
[86:23.09]We can get started.
[86:24.50]The sooner I master it, the better.
[86:26.58]Very well.
[86:27.52]I will require some groshing from you, though.
[86:29.50]How much?
[86:30.06]And set aside at least a couple of days so I can put you through your paces.
[86:34.52]If indeed time is of the essence.
[86:37.93]50 bucks?
[86:38.87]I got the coin.
[86:43.98]I can't wait to select the word.
[86:46.94]It's going to be a crossword puzzle or something.
[86:50.22]Done.
[86:50.38]Wake up, lad.
[86:50.90]It's time we were getting on.
[87:08.15]There's a cutscene for this.
[87:12.95]Mm-hmm.
[87:14.62]Here we go.
[87:14.90]Here comes the... I have to pick the word.
[87:16.30]Here we go.
[87:16.86]Read the book.
[87:21.20]It's a book on the... Try to read it.
[87:23.10]Okay, read.
[87:32.52]Being able to read was a very rare skill in the Middle Ages and a common blacksmith's son certainly wouldn't have been literate.
[87:38.73]You can open a book and try to make sense out of the glyphs, but in the end you will have to find someone who can teach you at least the basics of reading.
[87:45.37]Who knows, perhaps I didn't read it fast enough.
[87:50.55]180, a countryman going to the nest of his goose found an egg.
[87:55.83]What do I have to do here?
[88:06.21]Can we do another lesson?
[88:07.63]Oh, hey.
[88:13.50]I need more lessons.
[88:17.14]Oh, shit.
[88:17.48]I have to read the book.
[88:18.16]I have to actually read the book.
[88:20.74]I have to do a book report on this.
[88:23.20]You got it.
[88:25.18]I have to read this out loud in real life.
[88:29.06]One day a countryman going to the nest of his goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering.
[88:36.46]When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away because he thought a trick had been played upon him.
[88:44.71]But he took it home on second thoughts and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold.
[88:56.45]Every morning the same thing occurred and he soon became rich by selling his eggs.
[89:02.41]As he grew rich, he grew greedy.
[89:05.35]And thinking to get at once all the gold... Thinking to get... At once all the gold the goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.
[89:18.70]I know this whole story now.
[89:23.17]Let me give you a fucking quick book report in front of the class.
[89:27.53]I've read the book.
[89:30.09]Wonderful.
[89:31.05]So tell me, what have you learned?
[89:34.12]It was something about some fellow and a goose.
[89:36.58]Being greedy doesn't pay.
[89:38.18]That being greedy doesn't pay.
[89:40.64]Excellent.
[89:42.17]You're one of my most talented pupils.
[89:44.67]First grade genius.
[89:47.75]Like I told you, books are valuable.
[89:50.77]the words that you place in them ought to be no less so does that mean that I can read them yes you have the foundation remember my boy the pen is mightier than the sword to fully learn your way around read the latin text take a lot more reading yet now we'll move on to the second lesson which will be much harder many books are written in latin language of erudite and religious men
[90:16.39]If you really want to be able to read, there's no getting away from Latin.
[90:20.59]There's a book on the table with some text.
[90:23.47]Read it and then come back.
[90:25.47]You need not understand it, but you should master the letters.
[90:29.43]I only just managed the fable about the goose, and now you're asking me to tackle Latin.
[90:33.92]You're a clever lad.
[90:35.56]I hope you know Latin.
[90:37.78]I don't.
[90:38.14]Alright, let's give it a try.
[90:47.45]Read it.
[91:03.08]Unul su est ibre, tam malsu ut non alquea adporsit.
[91:09.20]Libri muti amgriste, snut puamtis orata est, che basque verbes plorime disit.
[91:19.45]A+.
[91:23.97]What the hell?
[91:25.75]Portal opens up and, like, demon grabs me.
[91:30.30]I read the page.
[91:31.16]I read the page.
[91:33.32]So tell me, what's written there?
[91:37.24]Oh, no.
[91:38.92]Oh, boy, boy, boy.
[91:39.84]It was this.
[91:40.26]Which one?
[91:41.20]Oh, shit.
[91:41.68]I think it was this one.
[91:49.71]Dulles liver tamales would non a liquor party profit.
[91:56.29]Nullus est liver tamales non a liquor party profit.
[92:05.38]Good heavens.
[92:07.18]Don't tell me you haven't had lessons before.
[92:08.70]I'm a fucking master at this.
[92:10.70]Excellent.
[92:11.74]Well, there's nothing more I can teach you.
[92:15.04]congratulations you can go and be ordained right away thank you domine I'm feeling a lot uh wiser you've learned a new level in reading any more books I want to like read more books can I read another one I want to be perfect oh here we go evil morales and bohemia maidens of war what do these do
[92:44.76]Okay, let me go to my skill points here.
[92:48.08]We've got some skills.
[92:51.30]Hunting, reading.
[92:54.85]All books are cheaper in shops.
[92:56.39]When reading, you will get tired and hungry twice as slowly as normal.
[93:03.36]Cheaper books.
[93:08.10]Let's buy a book and read it.
[93:16.88]A little bit cheaper now.
[93:17.70]Alright, uh, which one are we gonna read?
[93:20.38]Primer?
[93:21.02]Primer 2.
[93:21.44]I don't wanna do the sequel first.
[93:25.36]What's the cheapest one?
[93:26.06]Evil Morals and Bohemia on Prague.
[93:28.60]On Old Father Czech.
[93:32.34]How about Maiden's War 2?
[93:33.40]That sounds like a good, like, scholastic, off-the-shelf book.
[93:41.76]Maiden's War 2 and... on Tournaments.
[93:46.99]And of course we're going to haggle.
[93:50.26]Let's talk about the price.
[93:52.00]Primer.
[93:52.52]Why not?
[93:54.90]What about the funny Facebook?
[93:58.28]Aye.
[93:59.16]That would do it.
[94:01.72]Okay.
[94:02.46]Let's open it up.
[94:03.64]I'm excited.
[94:08.74]Maiden's War 2.
[94:09.92]Read it.
[94:12.68]The Maiden's War.
[94:13.44]The woman and their... I don't have to read this, right?
[94:15.04]I can just kind of skim through it.
[94:20.13]Oh, that's it.
[94:20.79]It's that easy.
[94:24.88]Okay.
[94:26.40]Done.
[94:28.62]Uh, read it.
[94:29.54]On tournaments.
[94:31.00]Tournaments or tourneys are favorite entertainment of the world.
[94:33.62]It's funny shit.
[94:35.36]Read it all.
[94:35.88]No.
[94:37.70]Okay, I just have to go like this a couple times, and then the skill point goes through.
[94:40.86]These aren't skill books.
[94:45.18]What do you mean they're not skill books?
[94:49.18]Um, are you sure about that?
[94:50.28]Because I have... I'm almost at another point in reading.
[94:58.73]Gee, that's how he reads in real life.
[95:01.81]No, it's not, please.
[95:04.53]Enables you to get antlers from hunted animals or tusks.
[95:07.37]Excuse me.
[95:09.40]I need to buy some spell books.
[95:13.42]Let's do antlers.
[95:19.74]Buy primer.

[95:32.15]We'll read these and I'm going to haggle it.

[95:36.41]Hmm.
[95:38.53]Alright, so.
[95:42.83]Are we agreed?
[95:45.55]Well now, a little more and we'll shake on it.

[96:58.08]Sit, for God's sake, sit.
[97:01.30]Standing and reading.
[97:04.38]No, because how many times have you guys been in bed and you open up a page of a book?
[97:09.99]And I don't care what book it is.
[97:11.31]It could be Jurassic Park, the original.
[97:13.31]It could be Game of Thrones.
[97:14.81]It could be Goosebumps.
[97:16.17]If you lie in bed and you read a book, you're going to get five pages and the book's going to hit you in the chest and you're going to fall asleep.
[97:24.31]Leveled up.
[97:25.80]Okay, hold on.
[97:28.26]How am I doing now?
[97:29.58]Can I sleep in this guy's house?
[97:30.60]Alright, I've eaten.
[97:38.61]Now let's relax.
[97:39.35]We're gonna read for three days, okay?
[97:44.85]I'm gonna sleep in this guy's house.
[97:53.10]Here we go, sleep.
[97:56.76]Put the fucking weapon away.
[98:00.33]It's dark.
[98:01.37]Go to bed.
[98:01.91]Fine.
[98:02.29]It's dark.
[98:02.93]Sleep.
[98:04.67]Sleep.
[98:06.95]I can't see a goddamn thing.
[98:12.69]Put the weapon.
[98:13.47]No, I want to sleep in this bed.
[98:15.09]No, that's my bed.
[98:20.45]I have my own bed in this town.
[98:22.43]For God's sakes.
[98:25.58]Where is it?
[98:28.38]Where is my bed?
[98:30.04]I have one here, don't I?
[98:31.88]No, I don't.
[98:33.50]I'll find a place to sleep.
[98:43.13]There's gonna be a random place to lie down.
[98:50.25]Go to the tavern.
[98:51.25]What's that thing?
[98:54.67]Oh, fucking Satan, huh?
[98:56.11]Satan's funny?
[98:58.79]I don't know.
[98:59.13]I'm just going to go in this guy's house.
[99:01.21]Is this his house?
[99:04.08]No, I can't.
[99:06.30]Go to the tavern.
[99:06.90]I don't know where the tavern even is here.
[99:12.78]Trade.
[99:13.22]There's a quest giver here.
[99:15.94]I really don't want to go all the way back.
[99:21.78]I've got to find a place to sleep.
[99:25.67]Can I sleep in the pillory?
[99:32.68]Alright, quick, alright, ready?
[99:34.88]I'm gonna go in this, and somebody take my picture!
[99:36.54]Whoa, but, I'm in the stocks!
[99:38.77]I'm in the pillory!
[99:39.67]And then I gotta post it on, like, Instagram, like, Whoa, what did I do?
[99:45.63]I got arrested!
[99:46.47]Bed.
[99:50.43]Bed.
[99:51.90]Bed.
[99:56.99]Out of the way.
[99:57.75]Bed.
[99:59.70]You have to have a bed in your house.
[100:01.42]Sleep.
[100:06.82]Comfort.
[100:07.50]Alright, nourishment.
[100:08.16]Here we go.
[100:08.50]I don't need to sleep for that long.
[100:09.36]I only need to sleep until four hours.
[100:22.18]That's a very sad bed.
[100:23.14]Yeah, that bed is right next to the ladder.
[100:26.32]inside the storeroom?
[100:30.08]Then I'm gonna sit and I'm gonna read again.
[100:31.74]Yeah, my energy... I got 97% energy.
[100:48.26]Then I'm gonna sit on the bed and read.
[100:50.90]Is there a sit here?
[100:52.24]Can I sit on the bed?
[100:54.21]What about up here?
[100:54.79]Does somebody have like a desk I can sit at and just read in their house?
[101:01.87]Now I'm in a private place.
[101:04.08]That's fine.
[101:06.90]The person is... Everyone's asleep anyways.
[101:10.48]Alright.
[101:11.18]We're gonna read Primer.
[101:13.54]Study it.
[101:15.10]Progress 100%.
[101:16.04]The book won't take that long to finish.
[101:18.75]Finish it.
[101:33.46]Progress.
[101:35.02]Why is it still at 84%?
[101:35.72]You've already read this book from cover to cover.
[101:40.68]Alright, time for Primer 2.
[101:45.37]Did I get any skills or anything?
[101:47.39]In reading?
[101:50.93]Nope, almost.
[101:53.19]Reading inventory, Primer 2.
[101:57.35]Here it is, the latest one.
[101:58.43]Primer, you haven't reached the skill level needed to be able to read this book.
[102:04.37]Oh, come on.
[102:04.95]What?
[102:10.32]Shit.
[102:16.87]Whatever.
[102:21.13]That's fine.
[102:31.33]They didn't see that, right?
[102:32.27]Can they like, is this like a situation like a cartoon where it's like all jingling and jangling all over me?
[102:36.05]What time is it?
[102:41.60]Alright.
[102:42.90]Now let me uh, let me just sit down and figure out what I'm doing here.
[102:48.39]Noisy chair?
[102:50.93]You can hear that?
[102:58.67]So this is just a potion.
[103:00.23]Beer.
[103:00.59]Let's just have a drink.
[103:01.25]Oh, I have 12 of them.
[103:03.59]Alright, no more than that.
[103:06.41]This is just making me happy, right?
[103:09.33]Nourishment's fine.
[103:10.19]Energy's fine.
[103:10.91]Let's move some shit to the horse.
[103:15.91]What does this stuff do?
[103:16.53]Okay, let's dump some of the beer.
[103:23.55]All of it, actually.
[103:24.45]It's taking up too much space.
[103:28.57]Rabbit meat.
[103:29.23]Get rid of it to the horse.
[103:30.59]How much space does the horse have?
[103:32.17]Get rid of this.
[103:43.31]Jesus Christ.
[103:45.45]My horse can't carry any more stuff.
[103:49.88]Shrink all their entire inventory of booze.
[104:00.88]What's with the clown shoes?
[104:02.04]I don't know.
[104:05.81]Just kidding.
[104:08.17]Okay, I kind of know how to read.
[104:10.15]I'm going to go back to the house and see if I can look at the wall and see what it says.
[104:19.15]I just heard thief, thief.
[104:20.09]Go quick.
[104:20.41]I don't even know how they would know.
[104:32.80]How would you know?
[104:38.56]I've read a book in your house.
[104:40.16]That's all that happened.
[104:41.06]Alright, I'm fine.
[104:48.37]The horse okay?
[104:48.75]Yeah.
[104:48.99]Alright, can I read it?
[104:51.31]What does it say?
[104:53.97]Judas.
[104:55.05]Judas.
[104:56.35]Looks like this is meant to be a warning.
[104:58.47]But for who?
[105:00.03]Why?
[105:02.08]Judas.
[105:02.32]Hmm.
[105:02.48]It was race.
[105:02.80]Am I stuck in the house?
[105:04.72]Uh...
[105:31.74]Judas.
[105:34.15]Judas.
[105:39.53]Gotta talk to towns, people!
[105:48.21]That means we have to just sit here for like an hour.
[105:49.93]Dude, I don't have a book to read.
[105:53.01]It says Farkle.
[106:08.87]Put this away.
[106:09.59]Now put this... I want to put down the torch.
[106:14.43]You need to hold the button.
[106:15.41]Hold it.
[106:16.09]Thank you.
[106:19.23]Anybody know anything else?
[106:21.11]Squeaky chair.
[106:21.93]I know.
[106:23.96]Give me a break.
[106:25.84]I lean back and it goes... Sorry.
[106:32.44]Just imagine I'm an old man in a rocking chair.
[106:34.20]And you'll immerse yourself even more.
[106:40.46]Maybe the priest.
[106:42.30]Yeah, because Judas, priest.
[106:44.40]That makes sense.
[106:46.50]Where was Mr. Priest?
[106:49.43]He was like back here, right?
[106:51.59]Wasn't he down here?
[106:53.73]Before all this nonsense?
[106:59.39]What is this?
[107:00.45]Unexplored place.
[107:01.69]Where was that priest?
[107:06.95]I feel like he was like here.
[107:10.21]At the church?
[107:10.87]Yeah, I mean, where was the church?
[107:12.43]I forget where the hell it is.
[107:15.80]Like this up?
[107:16.52]No, that's like the... You can see it, a church.
[107:22.24]Talking about like this, right here.
[107:25.58]Where would a priest be?
[107:26.77]Hmm.
[107:30.43]At the church.
[107:40.39]Yes, that's a church.
[107:43.33]Well, the guy was like outside swinging around his sword.
[107:45.41]I don't remember where the hell he was.
[107:50.61]Check inside the pub.
[107:57.57]Hey, look, a church.
[108:03.35]He's at the brothel.
[108:08.11]Dead in the woods.
[108:08.97]That's not the same priest.
[108:16.39]That wasn't even a priest.
[108:21.24]Yeah, this is a creepy priest.
[108:25.16]Up the stairs?
[108:26.88]Yeah.
[108:30.28]There's a genuine nudity warning here soon.
[108:32.84]Really?
[108:33.30]Oh, well, that's... That's interesting.
[108:36.26]Why would there be a nudity warning inside the church?
[108:39.16]Come on, guys.
[108:39.96]This is the house of God.
[108:43.20]What are you talking about?
[108:45.34]Who's in here?
[108:48.53]Should I just wait here for like an hour?
[109:04.97]Tattletail?
[109:15.08]Wait until it's dark out.
[109:22.11]Door's open.
[109:27.80]That's a private place.
[109:33.92]Okay.
[109:35.24]Is this raining?
[109:35.74]Nobody's outside, it's raining.
[109:42.59]Can I, like, change it so the weather's nicer?
[109:44.75]What, up there?
[109:45.65]No?
[109:49.32]Don't go in my private, empty room.
[109:53.16]That's as big as a closet.
[109:58.90]This is the priest's kiosk.
[110:01.92]Where I buy and sell stuff.
[110:04.32]Up there.
[110:05.50]Okay, he's probably in this little private room.
[110:14.39]Oh, goddammit.
[110:16.29]What about over here?
[110:16.89]Is it one of these houses, maybe?
[110:21.21]He lives in one of the houses by the church.
[110:23.93]He was out here practicing swinging.
[110:28.85]I just want to make sure he's not out here.
[110:30.31]It's raining outside.
[110:31.51]Hey, you.
[110:32.69]Where's your dad?
[110:39.43]You live here?
[110:40.49]Of course.
[110:42.56]I mean here.
[110:44.00]In the presbytery.
[110:45.32]In the presbytery.
[110:47.28]In the presbytery.
[110:49.10]With the parish priest.
[110:50.52]Yes.
[110:51.90]What's the matter?
[110:52.60]Don't you like me?
[110:55.15]Yes, of course I like you.
[110:56.69]So why are you surprised Godwyn likes me too?
[110:59.03]I'm not.
[111:00.17]He's a man of God.
[111:01.15]I mean, I see.
[111:02.47]Alright, well that was a great conversation.
[111:12.16]Lockpick, very easy.
[111:14.44]Open your door.
[111:18.74]There!
[111:19.24]Oh, there!
[111:19.68]Finally, finally, finally.
[111:20.86]He's eating... ...all this stuff.
[111:24.84]Father Godwyn, how are you?
[111:26.92]Can I bother you for a moment?
[111:32.50]The blessings of our good Lord be with you, Father.
[111:35.60]I'm here in the name of Sir Hanush of Lipa, investigating the massacre at Neuton.
[111:38.88]He's eating his robe.
[111:39.92]He'll be connected to a murder here.
[111:41.34]Can I ask you a few questions?
[111:43.40]He's eating spaghettios out of his robe.
[111:44.79]Sir Hanush is employing children as investigators.
[111:47.69]But ask as you wish, boy.
[111:49.01]I hope this nasty business will be cleared up quickly.
[111:52.71]Did you know Lubos?
[111:53.99]What was he like?
[111:54.55]A bit of a lost soul.
[111:55.95]A simple, rough fellow, but at heart I don't think he was such a bad person.
[112:03.92]Can I say, I saw Judas on the wall.
[112:05.00]He's just having a few have-dons.
[112:20.25]Do you know what Lew Bosch was doing on the day Neuhoff was raided?
[112:23.19]Unfortunately, I do know.
[112:25.79]And I'd like to help you with your investigation, but I can't.
[112:29.69]What?
[112:29.91]What are you talking about?
[112:31.83]I'm bound by certain vows that forbid me to tell you.
[112:35.05]Dr. Patient Confidentiality.
[112:37.69]There are laws of God above the laws of man, son.
[112:41.79]And one of those is the sanctity of the confessional.
[112:47.34]The rain is getting louder.
[112:48.08]Okay.
[112:48.40]I got five plus three.
[112:49.84]Because I'm talking to a nobleman.
[112:51.04]Or I could just beat the shit out of him.
[113:13.05]That's... 5 plus 3 is 8.
[113:14.45]Okay?
[113:15.79]I have to assume that Father Godwyn is a very well-spoken man.
[113:19.82]I have 9.
[113:20.58]That's my highest stat.
[113:22.26]You think a priest is going to be able to fight me?
[113:25.42]I have a higher chance of threatening him and winning because he's... What?
[113:28.62]He's a guy in robes with hands.
[113:30.08]You're going to scratch me?
[113:32.82]He probably has a 2 for his strength.
[113:39.72]And you could become the noble aspect.
[113:42.56]He's probably one of the most respected noble people in time.
[113:49.64]Did you see him with that sword?
[113:50.64]Yeah.
[113:51.35]I saw him practicing with a wooden sword.
[113:54.71]This guy's never fought a man in his life.
[114:10.66]I'm going to try it, but I'm going to lose.
[114:12.04]I knew it.
[114:12.50]I'm going to have to fight this priest.
[114:15.18]No one escapes punishment.
[114:40.90]Father, didn't I see you outside practicing swordsmanship?
[114:43.81]I would have expected that from a man of the cloth.
[114:46.53]With a stick.
[114:48.01]I practiced with a stick.
[114:49.43]A reminder of my youth and days gone by.
[114:53.19]And it helped keep me in good form.
[114:57.30]Father, Lubos was my only lead to the Neuhof Raiders.
[115:00.28]Only he could tell me who was responsible for that massacre.
[115:03.02]If I don't find out who it was, it will probably happen again.
[115:05.80]Surely you wouldn't want that.
[115:07.13]I wouldn't.
[115:08.73]But I can't betray the sanctity of the confession.
[115:12.67]I'll tell you what.
[115:13.69]Give me some time and I'll try to think up some way of helping.
[115:16.54]Yeah, I'll give you time.
[115:17.16]We'll talk it over in the evening.
[115:19.42]Okay, we can talk about this.
[115:20.46]Over a cup of good wine.
[115:22.60]Maybe we'll come up with... If I don't get it, he's dead.
[115:25.26]Thank you for... Me?
[115:27.56]Well, back to eating his fucking hamptons.
[115:34.93]I want to punch him in the face so bad.
[115:36.31]Be a bit more careful.
[115:43.93]Alright, I need to wait until later in the night, right?
[115:47.15]Meet the parish priest in the tavern in the evening.
[115:49.09]I'm just going to stand outside the tavern.
[115:52.57]Now I'm going to buy another book.
[115:53.65]Perfect opportunity to get another book.
[115:56.33]Scribe.
[115:58.69]That is a book opportunity.
[116:10.52]He just asked me to dinner.
[116:18.76]Steal books from the idiot scribe.
[116:22.53]I don't think a scribe can be an idiot.
[116:26.61]Is that the scribe?
[116:27.67]Yeah, there he is.
[116:28.39]Naked.
[116:30.05]Oh, we're gonna get every book.
[116:31.99]Every single book.
[116:32.84]What do you think?
[116:33.22]And read them and then throw them away.
[116:36.24]Ooh.
[116:36.48]Oh my god.
[116:39.74]That was real quick.
[116:41.94]You just... Okay, Clark Kent.
[116:44.27]See you later.
[116:45.63]How was the phone booth?
[117:00.73]Any more books on his shelf?
[117:07.15]In the corner.
[117:18.22]No, fuck it.
[117:19.00]Alright, I'm just gonna sit and read the book that I just stole.
[117:25.46]Steals books.
[117:27.10]Excuse me.
[117:28.30]These books are like $100 each.
[117:32.26]Groom and the Apprentice.
[117:36.20]Nothing.
[117:36.50]It's not a skill book.
[117:40.18]This is a long one.
[117:43.12]Alright.
[117:43.44]I can't read Primer 2.
[117:44.24]How about this one?
[117:47.12]Okay.
[117:47.96]Got it.
[117:50.47]I can read Primer 2 now.
[117:52.77]Let's read this one too.
[117:57.41]Now we can do primer two.
[118:03.51]I'm ready.
[118:04.51]No, wait, wait, first of all, hold on.
[118:07.07]I got a skill point in reading.
[118:09.64]In the flow.
[118:12.18]When reading, you will get tired and hungry twice as slowly.
[118:15.02]The first time you look at a fiesco, a fresco, cross or wayside shrine, your charisma will increase by +2.
[118:23.60]Okay.
[118:24.79]Being well learned, you make a better impression on people and get a plus one speech bonus when trying to persuade a guard.
[118:32.55]Thank you.
[118:35.86]Time to read primer two.
[118:40.70]Bingo.
[118:42.04]Let's read this for... You can't read any longer just now.
[118:47.19]Alright, let's do three hours.
[118:52.27]I'm finally going to be able to convince people that I'm on a secret mission.
[118:56.53]A secret book reading mission.
[119:10.29]Secret agents know how to read really well.
[119:12.15]Yep, they have to.
[119:19.80]I wonder if this is going to give me another skill point.
[119:21.80]Another level in reading.
[119:22.54]I can't focus on reading anymore.
[119:24.92]You've read enough for the day.
[119:25.92]Alright.
[119:30.10]Uh, where's reading?
[119:32.38]Nah, I just leveled up.
[119:33.16]Okay.
[119:35.32]New perk points on locket levels 3, 5, 7.
[119:37.04]So, one more level.
[119:39.78]Alright, let's go meet the priest.
[119:46.28]And let's make sure to... Can I sell him the books that I stole from him?
[119:54.71]Huh.
[119:55.49]I wonder.
[119:57.77]Because it doesn't say they're stolen.
[119:58.97]How you doing?
[120:09.32]Let's trade.
[120:13.96]Yes, I can.
[120:19.98]So let's get rid of all these, because I read them all.
[120:27.43]I still have to finish Primer 2.
[120:28.41]What do you mean, no, don't do it?
[120:38.17]It doesn't have the hand on it.
[120:45.28]He'll know?
[120:46.02]How would he know?
[120:47.94]The hand is not on it.
[120:48.80]It doesn't have the stolen hand.
[120:51.66]Didn't you buy this book from me yesterday?
[120:55.42]No, no, no.
[120:56.57]I still am reading that one.
[121:00.21]That just proves that I'm not actually reading.
[121:04.75]Alright, let's close the deal.
[121:09.43]You guys were worried about nothing.
[121:10.43]I've already eaten.
[121:21.94]Read the books before you saw them.
[121:22.94]I've read them all.
[121:24.96]I went through them all, except for Primer 2.
[121:28.39]Okay, uh, let's go to the... Let's go to the steakhouse.
[121:34.03]And meet Father... Father Grom.
[121:39.41]Whatever his name is.
[121:51.84]Let's go.
[121:53.56]I didn't sell Primer 2.
[121:56.59]I took it out of the basket.
[121:59.19]Oh, this is a Christmas festival.
[122:00.09]Look at the wreath.
[122:05.92]Do I have any... Where is he?
[122:14.08]Father.
[122:14.38]Do I have to meet him outside?
[122:20.92]Is he waiting for me?
[122:22.86]Should I just wait for him?
[122:30.52]It's like noon right now.
[122:31.94]Yeah, this is the perfect time to go get shit-faced.
[122:41.20]Just gonna wait until the evening.
[122:42.28]I wish I could read right now.
[122:45.69]Tell me I can't read.
[122:48.63]Come on.
[122:50.45]God damn it.
[122:52.41]Well...
[122:57.33]I can only read the book for like four hours a day.
[123:00.23]I don't have any schnapps, so I can't just save the game.
[123:02.77]Looks like we're just gonna sit down and wait.
[123:04.09]I wish I could read right now.
[123:08.36]I wish I could read.
[123:10.06]Let's go.
[123:10.62]Let's just wait.
[123:14.88]Just have a seat.
[123:16.42]Sit here in the rain for five hours.
[123:31.88]My energy is 80.
[123:32.75]It's not a big deal.
[123:39.53]That should be alright.
[123:40.23]Now it's 16 o'clock.
[123:50.04]Is the priest in there at 16 o'clock?
[123:54.19]No.
[123:55.53]Alright, well now I'm going to sleep in somebody's bed.
[124:00.72]That's like a dog bed I can't sleep in that one Perfect Let's go right here four hours and I'm gonna eat the free food in the table Almost there
[124:30.35]Evening is 4 p.m.
[124:32.99]Well, late afternoon is 4, 5.
[124:39.48]So, technically, that is close to evening.
[124:41.60]It's not quite there yet, but it's close.
[124:46.76]Close.
[124:51.97]Here we are.
[124:57.75]Here he comes.
[125:00.10]He's not even in here.
[125:00.70]Is this guy standing me up?
[125:16.18]There he is!
[125:18.63]I'm here!
[125:18.95]Let's have a drink and discuss how you can tell me things.
[125:32.44]Save.
[125:32.86]Why does everyone want me to save?
[125:35.50]If I'm having a conversation with a priest.
[125:41.22]I can't save.
[125:41.74]I have a time limit.
[125:42.51]Um...
[126:00.51]Why do I have a time limit?
[126:10.22]Let's play the sympathy card.
[126:11.70]You know what I mean?
[126:12.60]Like, he's gonna feel bad.
[126:13.36]If I'm like, no, he'll give me information.
[126:16.48]You know, yeah, it was.
[126:20.02]It would really make me feel better if you could tell me some fucking information here, man.
[126:27.48]Why am I still wearing this helmet?
[126:29.86]That's gotta be so sweaty under there now.
[126:31.89]My hair's wet from being inside of there.
[126:34.27]What's wrong with me?
[126:47.70]I wanted to try and help my parents, but there was nothing I could do.
[126:50.12]What am I doing?
[126:50.50]Why am I doing, like, the guilty dog?
[126:51.98]And I fled to Talmberg with the humans on my heels.
[126:54.66]They almost killed me.
[126:56.66]They slaughtered people.
[126:57.43]Like, oh, my dog got into the trash, and you look over, and he's like, I didn't do it.
[127:00.57]I did.
[127:02.15]Folk who tried to take refuge there, but they... My poor child.
[127:09.36]May God grant them eternal rest.
[127:11.64]And how did you come to get this assignment?
[127:14.02]I'd have expected Sir Hanush to send that old grouch, Bernard.
[127:21.89]You think I'm too young for the job, Father?
[127:24.99]I do, to tell the truth.
[127:26.51]Well, I can only apologize for my lack of gray hair and gout.
[127:30.20]Now the most important thing.
[127:32.34]What actually happened at Noyo?
[127:34.58]The good folks here about are saying all kinds of terrible things.
[127:37.91]But I take most of it with a pinch of salt.
[127:40.97]I feel like this guy might be a plant.
[127:43.41]Giving him information.
[127:44.13]I don't trust a guy with a reverse penguin.
[127:45.73]You know what I mean?
[127:46.71]I'm just going to be real.
[127:47.37]I see it's every bit as bad as people claimed.
[128:08.76]tell me about yourself notice you're handy with a sword notice you live with a woman let's try to get uh get some dirt on this guy
[128:31.26]I notice there's a woman living with you at the presbytery.
[128:33.94]What of it?
[128:35.08]Have you never met a cleric who lives with a woman before?
[128:38.23]Mother Church won't let me take her to wife.
[128:41.03]Too afraid it might lose its property to any heirs she born.
[128:45.41]But she cooks and cleans.
[128:48.39]And, well, as a man, I have my needs.
[128:51.09]Does this guy want to contest to be the actor for this guy?
[128:56.87]I heard he was a bit odd.
[128:58.55]Sweet steaks to be the... Wait a minute.
[129:02.52]Was this like a Kickstarter goal?
[129:06.04]Go look it up.
[129:06.54]Somebody find out.
[129:07.80]Was it like, if you give more than five grand, you get to be a character in the game.
[129:12.33]This is a Kickstarter goal, actor.
[129:17.93]Has to be.
[129:21.03]I noticed you're pretty handy with a sword.
[129:23.73]I wouldn't expect that of a man of the cloth.
[129:25.75]You know what they say, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
[129:30.63]Henry is a backer.
[129:32.42]Let's just say I haven't always been a priest.
[129:35.44]Fate led me to places where affairs were settled by force.
[129:39.30]These days, of course, it's just a bit of exercise to keep me in shape.
[129:44.62]Okay, well, let's get to the point.
[129:45.52]Well, we've had an agreeable chat, but now let's get down to business.
[129:48.38]So, about this confessional seal...
[129:51.10]Do you really want more innocent people to die?
[129:53.48]Henry, that's not how it works.
[129:57.18]Finger wag.
[129:57.80]Everybody does.
[129:59.44]Because if you do it once, you'll forever be tempted to do it again.
[130:04.15]If people stop believing in the church because their confessional secrets are betrayed, they won't trust anyone.
[130:10.45]And that's worse than even the most hideous crimes.
[130:15.98]Yep.
[130:16.08]Yeah, I'm just shit-faced.
[130:32.70]Yeah, entertainment.
[130:33.28]Priests are gonna have to start doing Minecraft Let's Plays at their sermons.
[130:53.22]The younger generation, man, that's the only thing they know how to understand.
[130:56.94]The tongue-lashing about the two popes goes down well these days.
[131:01.11]And stories from real life with a nice moral to them are popular as well.
[131:05.41]Especially if they're about fornication and similar scandalous vices.
[131:10.63]Can you give me an example?
[131:12.03]Well, recently a priest by the name of Jan Hus started preaching in Prague.
[131:17.25]They better provide mugs of cider.
[131:19.08]And the people liked it.
[131:20.50]I hear he always has a full house.
[131:22.78]A journeyman who heard him told me what Hus is preaching, and I like the sound of it.
[131:27.18]I'm thinking about putting it in my own repertoire.
[131:30.13]What's so amazing about it?
[131:32.13]The preaching of Master Jan Hus about Mother Church.
[131:36.02]The lamentable well in which... I'm staring at the camera.
[131:40.05]Is this the office?
[131:41.91]And nearing the whole of Christendom.
[131:43.87]Like, oh, wow, he really said something weird.
[131:45.73]Look right in the camera.
[131:46.81]What the fuck, man?
[131:48.79]...to devour every grain of gold and silver.
[131:52.22]They know no mercy.
[131:53.82]Their hearts are corrupted by longing for wealth, and they shamelessly profit from everything.
[132:00.10]You want to baptize a child?
[132:02.00]Hey, you want to steal and murder?
[132:04.68]Hey, and you will have absolution.
[132:06.70]What if the devil himself were...
[132:08.48]Jim stare Tell me how you really feel I really hope I really hope one of my
[132:38.45]Is my next dialogue option relax?
[132:40.05]I wish.
[132:40.23]Like, dot, dot, dot, relax.
[132:41.03]I would pick it.
[132:42.51]Yeah.
[133:04.79]Jesus, man.
[133:05.53]Bring it a little higher.
[133:06.59]Come on, Mark.
[133:07.19]Bring it a little higher.
[133:08.03]More intensity.
[133:08.63]Nice.
[133:31.30]Where can I find out more about his teachings?
[133:33.84]You like it?
[133:35.12]I copied down some of his sermons.
[133:37.00]They're interesting.
[133:37.58]You can read them at my presbytery.
[133:41.33]What do you think of this Jan Hus?
[133:43.53]He's certainly a wise man.
[133:44.87]A little overzealous for my taste.
[133:47.67]If he got out of Prague and came here for a look, I'm sure he'd stop condemning drinking and lying with women.
[133:55.16]What do the folks think about it?
[133:56.08]What do the common folk think of it?
[133:57.76]They like it.
[133:59.08]They're happy to hear someone say what they think themselves, but are afraid to say aloud things that make them angry.
[134:05.55]They're calling for change.
[134:07.09]In a few years, it'll have grown beyond control.
[134:10.19]Mark my words, the people will rise up and the church will be shaken to its very foundation.
[134:15.45]I don't know why I see... Don't ask me why I'm seeing this now, but I'm seeing a fake beard on my guy.
[134:22.39]University in Europe?
[134:27.37]Thanks for the sermon, but I think I've been morally uplifted enough.
[134:30.11]One of those jokey novelty masks for when it's cold outside.
[134:33.69]What are your plans, father?
[134:35.74]What do you suppose?
[134:36.64]I'm so drunk.
[134:37.28]We have a drink, of course.
[134:41.56]Ah, that sounds like a good plan.
[134:43.64]I knew you wouldn't let me down.
[134:46.65]You've reached a new level in drinking.
[134:49.03]Cool.
[134:49.33]See you soon.
[134:58.30]Alright, check in and... What is the music in the background?
[135:05.59]Is this like the Russian national anthem?
[135:07.77]What do you mean censor?
[135:09.87]What are we censoring?
[135:12.23]Oh, we're playing dice!
[135:33.84]Wait, is it really?
[135:36.17]Why would you be doing this?
[135:37.35]Freest.
[135:41.11]Where?
[135:43.69]Oh, he fell down.
[135:48.67]Enough of this.
[135:52.59]Bailiff, come on over here.
[135:54.85]Sit down and have a drink with us.
[135:56.87]Don't vex me again, Father.
[135:59.33]It's three hours past dusk, and curfew is long gone.
[136:02.95]Alright, so there's nudity coming up.
[136:05.03]So I'll have you all whipped and put in the stocks, and I'll write a letter to the bishop about you, priest.
[136:11.92]Well, nothing to worry about then.
[136:13.66]Everyone knows the only one around here who can write is me.
[136:17.15]Not true.
[136:17.85]I can.
[136:18.79]Men, throw them out.
[136:28.82]game nudity.
[136:31.10]Why do they have a baseball bat?
[136:36.66]Am I going to fight the king?
[136:39.43]We're not going to actually get in a fight right now, are we?
[136:45.55]Oh, man.
[136:46.59]Really?
[136:54.52]This is just a drunk fight.
[137:00.24]Well, everybody's a king.
[137:01.36]The guy that rules every... What?
[137:03.60]The governor.
[137:05.22]The merchant.
[137:10.63]Um, alright.
[137:11.21]We're just starting.
[137:19.00]I learned a point.
[137:19.52]I got a point in defense.
[137:23.74]What happened to the father?
[137:28.76]It's like so dark.
[137:31.18]Oh my lord.
[137:42.42]Right in the face, come on.
[137:53.45]What is going on?
[137:54.93]Climb the bell tower.
[137:56.19]Oh, this is here.
[137:56.79]Okay, here it comes.
[137:59.70]I'd love to.
[138:00.86]I'm ready for this.
[138:01.58]Hold on.
[138:22.14]I'll be ready.
[138:28.26]Hold on.
[138:33.65]Let me get that nice background on it.
[138:35.63]There we go.
[138:44.95]Make sure this is in the right spot.
[138:59.82]Okay, this should be it, right?
[139:01.02]Not yet.
[139:01.56]Don't need it yet.
[139:02.76]I'll go in first.
[139:03.36]I'm in a private area.
[139:04.88]Of course I'm in a private area.
[139:09.32]Here we go.
[139:09.88]Oh.
[139:30.80]I told you!
[139:31.32]What did I tell you?
[139:55.56]And you guys thought it was a joke!
[139:57.18]That shit happened!
[139:58.78]That was normal!
[139:59.78]And now, my dears, comes the climax of the evening.
[140:08.88]Okay.
[140:11.07]Now, now what?
[140:14.63]God, my new old goat.
[140:16.07]What?
[140:16.55]Come here.
[140:18.17]Am I?
[140:18.85]Oh, I thought I was just the point of view, like having sex with myself.
[140:23.84]Oh, my.
[140:24.22]Here it comes.
[140:24.60]I got it.
[140:24.84]Hold on.
[140:25.78]Wait!
[140:27.78]Priest has mounted up.
[140:29.38]What do you say, Henry?
[140:32.20]Shall we take a little ride?
[140:38.42]Oh, wait a minute.
[140:46.15]There we go.
[140:51.49]Okay.
[140:56.04]We're good?
[140:59.35]Ready to rock and roll.
[141:00.15]What the fuck are you doing?
[141:07.25]This guy is a psycho!
[141:15.63]What the hell are you doing?
[141:20.10]What the hell are you doing?
[141:27.01]Well, I have to say that was a fine evening.
[141:32.79]Are you serious?
[141:37.10]It was a sheep the whole time.
[141:38.78]It's going to be one of those scenarios where I come back to reality and it was just like a sheep.
[141:44.87]Like a cow or something.
[142:01.47]Godwyn, you beast.
[142:03.79]Get up.
[142:05.33]Do you hear me?
[142:07.29]Wake up, you drunkards.
[142:09.71]Oh, fuck it up.
[142:11.37]Is that coconut water?
[142:12.51]That's what I could really use right now.
[142:14.37]Who the hell are you?
[142:19.73]Henry.
[142:21.27]My great friend, Henry.
[142:22.67]Didn't we have a wonderful time?
[142:25.37]Well, you certainly did, you old lecher.
[142:28.45]Now you better pull yourself together quick.
[142:30.67]You haven't much time.
[142:32.35]There's some water and something to eat on the table there, but if I were you, I would move my hairy arse before my flock eats me alive.
[142:41.73]We're in so much trouble.
[142:45.23]Oh, my guts.
[142:48.14]My poor suffering stomach.
[142:52.60]What was that woman on about?
[142:55.60]Before my flock eats me alive.
[142:59.26]I've forgotten something.
[143:03.08]What have I forgotten?
[143:05.42]Where the fuck am I?
[143:06.86]What the fuck was it?
[143:08.67]No, don't skip it.
[143:09.87]Math.
[143:11.69]Oh shit, I have to say math.
[143:14.53]It's just a Grand Theft Auto mission.
[143:16.65]Right?
[143:16.83]This guy turned into a GTA character.
[143:18.71]Yeah.
[143:40.84]Then I drunkenly keep the whole town up all night.
[143:43.98]And now you want me to preach at them from the pulpit?
[143:47.78]Do you want them to burn us at the stake?
[143:49.62]Grand Theft Bohemia.
[143:52.26]Suppose that Sir Ratzig's protege, you just came from studying in Prague, and you want to share the words of Master Jan Hus, who you recently heard face to face.
[144:00.96]I have to give the sermon.
[144:02.81]Henry, look.
[144:04.37]From what I remember, we might have overdone it a bit last night.
[144:07.60]If the bailiff or someone else complains about me, the bishop's going to have my guts for garters.
[144:13.70]So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop gaping at me like a stuffed squirrel and start helping.
[144:18.34]Your mouth.
[144:20.16]Your start raving mouth.
[144:21.52]I'm not.
[144:22.26]It's a perfect plan.
[144:24.06]It's flawless.
[144:24.90]This guy turns into Mr. Magoo.
[144:26.17]Look at him.
[144:26.57]He's got his eyes closed.
[144:27.81]How about this?
[144:29.19]If you help me with this, I'll tell you who Lubosha's cronies are.
[144:33.43]Got it.
[144:35.07]I'll do it.
[144:46.79]uh alright I can't guarantee it though alright I can't make any promises about what happened no neither can I what you want me to do exactly I'll go and start the liturgy
[145:01.55]The whole thing.
[145:02.07]I gotta save this, though.
[145:03.29]If I fuck this up, it could ruin everything.
[145:05.03]Alright, I... Free books?
[145:05.83]No.
[145:30.76]What do I have closed right now?
[145:35.66]Do I have any nice stuff?
[145:38.42]Okay, I got this stuff.
[145:42.90]This is priestly, right?
[145:47.37]I think this is very godly stuff.
[146:04.36]Okay, I can't save it.
[146:05.08]I have to just get it right.
[146:06.34]Game is saved.
[146:06.90]Okay.
[146:08.50]What about, like, a helmet?
[146:09.28]Or a hat?
[146:11.86]Nah, get this off.
[146:15.08]Get this off me.
[146:16.76]Um... I don't have anything else.
[146:25.35]Put the silver ring on.
[146:30.11]I'm cosplaying as a Christian right now.
[146:40.62]Okay.
[146:55.37]That was kind of funny.
[146:56.13]You're in big trouble.
[146:56.75]Oh yeah, the missus is such a bitch.
[147:08.87]I can't believe it.
[147:13.80]Friar Tuck in the middle there.
[147:14.82]I know Latin.
[147:16.26]I know Latin.
[147:16.52]He said...
[147:37.12]Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.
[147:38.40]Did he shit his pants off?
[147:40.42]Oh, he burped.
[147:41.78]I'm dressed as the enemy.
[148:04.66]Hey, now everybody listen to me.
[148:06.68]I'm dressed up as the enemy of this state.
[148:10.81]To be incredibly disrespectful to you.
[148:13.59]...from Skalitz, who is here at the behest of Sir Hanush to investigate that heinous crime at Noiha.
[148:25.30]You might not know that Henry recently visited Prague.
[148:28.82]No, that's just a general, like, party store medieval outfit you get from the bag for Halloween.
[148:35.07]That's what that is.
[148:36.49]Just give me the shitty plastic sword and shield, the one that bends.
[148:40.19]That's what I look like.
[148:43.64]I look like the bag Halloween costume.
[148:45.92]And tell us what he heard.
[148:49.94]Because, as you all probably know, Jan Hus...
[148:55.60]is a very popular preacher in Prague.
[148:58.94]So, Henry, you may begin.
[149:00.82]I'm dressed as, like, a different, like, religion.
[149:11.13]Okay, begin the sermon confidently.
[149:15.35]Minus one, okay.
[149:19.75]Four minus one, eight.
[149:22.06]Can I, like, threaten them all?
[149:25.43]We're going to start with a lengthy sermon.
[149:29.21]Greetings, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[149:32.75]I am here to tell you about Mother Church and to show you through my words how she is falling into decay and abandoned.
[149:40.67]By the way, I'm also a part-time scarecrow.
[149:43.37]Losing her dignity and trading in soulslike the merchants in the temple.
[149:48.79]But I am digressing.
[149:51.09]That whelp wants to preach about the church.
[149:53.29]Fuck.
[149:56.10]uh creation has given to every man the power by which he might rule the whole world keep it short power does not give him the right to rule that right belongs to god alone oh no we gotta um continue worldly continue harshly
[150:18.11]It is the corruption of God's pastors here on Earth that has brought misfortune on our heads.
[150:23.64]Plague, cumin, hunger, and chaos.
[150:26.54]I look like an old school football player.
[150:28.46]The cursed wealth that the church is drowning in.
[150:31.16]Yeah, like the leather helmet.
[150:32.96]Yeah, part of the Boston Brawlers.
[150:38.21]Just like the flock of ravens that has descended on this land to peck up every speck of gold and silver.
[150:43.89]They show no mercy.
[150:45.61]Their hearts are poisoned by covetousness.
[150:48.98]A football just comes from off screen and I grab it and do like a big touchdown celebration.
[150:53.64]Pay.
[150:54.32]You want to steal and murder?
[150:56.02]Pay and you will have absolution.
[150:58.30]And the prelate sin and give themselves absolution.
[151:01.83]For shame.
[151:02.89]Shame upon them.
[151:03.79]Yep.
[151:04.83]Talk about the sin of fornication.
[151:06.09]Talk about drunkenness.
[151:06.93]The sin is human.
[151:09.36]Just a couple of humans.
[151:10.24]I'm pretty good at this.
[151:11.04]This will be my first time ever.
[151:11.88]Might think of a career change.
[151:35.83]Now that's the kind of sermon I like to hear.
[151:38.25]Two out of three.
[151:38.87]No, brothers and sisters.
[151:40.89]Jesus did not condemn alcohol.
[151:43.13]Drink to lighten the cross you bear in this veil of tears, but not with such abandon that you cannot keep holy the Sabbath.
[151:49.79]Complained about humans while dressed as a human.
[151:52.91]And it is not drinking itself that is sinful, but intemperance and beastly indulgence.
[151:58.69]He's right.
[152:01.36]Okay.
[152:02.86]Again, harshly.
[152:05.11]Enough about sin, which the prelates are so fond of preaching about, and whose absolution they promise if you only pay enough coin to Mother Church.
[152:13.36]What if the devil himself were to pay?
[152:15.86]Will the bishop tell us he too would ascend to heaven?
[152:18.52]And what about those bishops?
[152:20.12]They sin without remorse, and with the money grasped from the poor for indulgences, they keep fine horses and hordes of servants to pamper them.
[152:27.89]They played dice and garbed their mistresses in expensive furs, while Christ, the Lamb of God, walked barefoot and had nowhere to lay his head.
[152:36.81]Look to your consciences, you robbers of the poor, for you are seen by God and his people, too.
[152:42.62]Down with the prelates.
[152:43.94]Away with them.
[152:45.00]We're fortunate to have our good father, Godwyn.
[152:47.70]At least he's a fair and simple man.
[152:49.76]Who said that?
[152:51.32]Criticize priests, including Godwyn.
[152:54.01]Try some quote to conclude.
[152:56.35]I pull like a Mark Twain.
[152:59.39]I say to you in the words of Jan Hus, he who knows much, let him speak much.
[153:04.35]End on Mark Twain.
[153:04.97]He who knows little, let him speak little.
[153:08.66]A man that always tells the truth never has to remember a thing.
[153:11.66]Let him at least teach his neighbor one virtuous deed by setting him good example and refraining from playing dice and from fornication.
[153:20.06]And that applies both to priests and to you, brothers and sisters.
[153:24.07]That's his conclusion.
[153:25.79]What?
[153:26.27]That is all I heard in Prague.
[153:27.79]Alright, that's like four out of five.
[153:30.11]No, that's like four out of six, right?
[153:32.25]I win.
[153:41.67]Have you no shame?
[153:42.51]Oh, come on!
[153:45.11]I'll be writing to the bishops.
[153:46.11]What the fuck?
[153:47.75]For shame.
[153:48.87]Utterly blasphemous.
[153:49.85]What?
[153:50.25]Can you believe such behavior?
[153:52.34]For men of war to get drunk at pigs' church.
[153:57.75]Why?
[153:58.39]Come on, man.
[154:00.77]I had him going.
[154:01.52]I had like three or four successes in a row and I did a bad conclusion.
[154:06.72]I'm gonna kill him.
[154:08.12]Are you pulling my fucking pizzle?
[154:10.20]I couldn't have done worse myself if I'd puked on the altar.
[154:12.87]But I'm no preacher.
[154:14.13]Yeah, I noticed.
[154:15.69]And I wasn't the only one.
[154:18.17]You can't be serious.
[154:20.05]After all that...
[154:21.72]Oh my god.
[154:22.42]He's serious.
[154:56.47]Just reloaded.
[154:57.37]I'm reloading.
[155:00.17]Which one was it?
[155:00.65]This one?
[155:02.73]How far away was this?
[155:06.07]Gentlemen, reload.
[155:06.91]Yeah, I'm going to be harsh the whole time.
[155:21.71]Stop cheating.
[155:22.25]This is not cheating.
[155:22.91]This is... I'm just going to be harsh the entire time and I'm going to end on being even harsher.
[155:29.43]Let's go.
[155:30.48]Wait, I need to be right close.
[155:37.50]Maybe it was the outfit.
[155:38.18]We'll try a different outfit this time.
[155:50.95]Confident then harsh.
[155:55.66]Alright, let's go.
[156:08.23]Bare feet.
[156:08.77]Like basketball shorts.
[156:09.87]Okay, let's go.
[156:10.57]Let's go.
[156:10.93]Okay, let's do the sermon.
[156:13.13]So let's start confidently, right?
[156:37.90]Hold on, it's not man, but God.
[156:41.40]God stands at the head of the church.
[156:43.66]This is some Freemason Illuminati shit.
[156:49.52]Okay, now, harsh.
[157:08.23]It is the corruption of God's pastors here on Earth that has brought misfortune on our heads.
[157:13.73]Plague, humans, hunger, and chaos.
[157:18.38]The accursed wealth that the church is drowning in is the result of almost the whole of Christendom.
[157:23.86]When dogs are fighting over a bone, take the bone and they will stop.
[157:28.44]So how do I end it?
[157:29.80]Not with a quote?
[157:32.59]End it with a quote, not this time.
[157:34.09]They show no mercy.
[157:35.73]Their hearts are poisoned by covetousness.
[157:38.67]They trade everything.
[157:40.63]Everything is for sale.
[157:42.07]You want to baptize a child?
[157:43.75]Pay.
[157:44.43]You want to steal and murder?
[157:46.13]Pay and you will have absolution.
[157:48.41]And the prelate sin and give themselves absolution.
[157:51.91]For shame.
[157:53.09]Shame upon them.
[157:55.84]Okay, the sin is human.
[157:58.62]They liked this.
[157:59.02]We heard this.
[157:59.50]That's the kind of sermon I like.
[158:00.56]Defend God.
[158:00.86]Sounds good.
[158:01.50]Right.
[158:01.90]Continue harshly.
[158:28.20]Enough about sin, which the prelates are so fond of preaching about, and whose absolution they promise if you only pay enough coin to Mother Church.
[158:35.86]Success!
[158:36.44]What if the devil himself were to pay?
[158:39.01]These hand motions are insane.
[158:40.93]I feel like somebody has strings on my arms and lifting them up and down and juggling me around.
[158:44.83]Alright, here we go.
[158:45.55]Good Father Godwyn.
[158:54.76]Criticized.
[158:56.30]Criticized, but stand up for Godwyn.
[158:57.60]God sees what is happening on Earth, and he is filled with righteous wrath that those who should seek the salvation of souls instead seek mammon and the idle comfort of lucrative hosts.
[159:08.05]Blessed are the shepherds who share the poverty of their flock, who are as one with you and fail with you, who do not condemn your venial sins.
[159:19.20]Why, all honor to Godwyn.
[159:23.86]That is all I heard in Prague.
[159:27.19]Amen.
[159:29.27]Complete.
[159:30.77]Done.
[159:33.25]Why did I have to do that with the helmet on?
[159:43.58]Good.
[159:43.86]I liked that.
[159:45.13]Nice work.
[159:45.77]You really saved my ass there, kid.
[159:47.99]Thanks.
[160:07.71]Well, well, my boy.
[160:08.73]You smell good.
[160:09.23]You have talent, and I can't deny it.
[160:11.43]And you pulled a thorn from my side.
[160:12.79]I almost didn't make it.
[160:14.31]Yeah, I noticed.
[160:15.35]This guy's doing a Beetlejuice voice.
[160:17.33]Oh, what's to be done?
[160:19.37]Alright, you said my name three times.
[160:23.72]Beetlejuice.
[160:25.04]I say gluttony and fornication.
[160:28.52]God does forgive a penitent.
[160:30.26]So what did Limpy Lubos tell you?
[160:33.91]Was he at Neuhof that day?
[160:35.79]Who was with him?
[160:36.85]And where are they now?
[160:38.41]Slow down.
[160:40.03]He's even wearing black and white like Betelgeuse.
[160:42.17]Don't let me down after all I've been through.
[160:45.23]For you... Well, Lubos came to me shortly after it happened.
[160:50.35]His conscience was gnawing at him.
[160:52.85]And I must say, in the end, he turned out to be a better man than he looked.
[160:57.74]He said they'd been hired through some crony of theirs.
[161:02.35]And at first they were just to steal some horses.
[161:04.85]But then it all turned sour and people started getting killed.
[161:08.37]And neither he nor his cronies wanted anything to do with that.
[161:11.97]So they fell out from the gang and fled.
[161:14.53]Fell out?
[161:16.52]Yeah, there was a body found in the woods by Neuhof.
[161:21.14]That would explain something.
[161:22.72]Lubos kept jabbering that he wasn't a murderer, that he didn't want to do it.
[161:26.94]So I know that Lubos killed the murderer and he's dead too.
[161:31.12]The trouble is, I need to find the ones who are still alive.
[161:35.30]I need names and places.
[161:38.46]Did he mention any of the others?
[161:39.80]No, you better not say that again.
[161:41.66]Yeah, don't say the B word again.
[161:44.08]Fella called Ricky from Ledecko?
[161:47.14]Pius?
[161:48.08]Timmy?
[161:48.72]Pius.
[161:49.66]Be careful, don't say it three times.
[161:51.48]As pious as I am ordained.
[161:53.68]Nonsense.
[161:54.62]You would make an excellent priest.
[161:58.85]What's the status of the memes?
[162:00.15]That's important.
[162:23.75]Although I'm not sure I'd survive another night of your debauchery.
[162:26.65]And if anyone should ask, you heard nothing from me.
[162:30.69]I'll deny everything.
[162:32.29]Well.
[162:33.33]I don't doubt it.
[162:34.43]Just like being part of the CIA.
[162:37.49]Alright, let me take a quick break.
[162:40.28]I'm just going to pee.
[162:42.68]Might grab a drink.
[162:44.24]And I will be right back and we will continue our quest to try to find whodunit.
[162:50.62]Whodunit with the have-dons.
[162:51.56]See you in a minute.
[167:49.52]Fucking God.
[167:50.66]Give me a break.
[167:53.22]That was seriously a cartoon.
[167:55.74]So I got a drink, right?
[167:56.70]I filled up a glass with some apple juice.
[167:59.40]I got some apple juice at the store.
[168:01.50]Filled up the glass.
[168:03.51]Walked down the stairs.
[168:05.25]And on the way down the stairs, I stumbled a little and like a quarter of it fell out of the glass.
[168:10.89]I didn't drop the glass or anything, but like I lost a quarter of my apple juice, okay?
[168:14.71]I can't, I can't clean it up.
[168:16.69]It's just going to sit there for like an hour.
[168:18.85]Who cares?
[168:20.20]So come into the, I come into the office here and like the TV, remember the TV's back here, that big CRT TV.
[168:26.28]And I, sometimes I forget because I can't open the door all the way.
[168:28.80]Well, I forgot.
[168:29.65]And like, did it again.
[168:31.23]And like down, I'm down to like a third of apple juice in this glass.

[172:14.41]Although I think I might want to repair this, though, because this is a shirt.

[176:50.36]Somebody saw that.
[176:51.08]Alright, take all of his shit.
[176:55.24]And give me his weapon, too.
[176:55.85]It was something cool.
[176:58.27]Man, some game master you are.
[177:00.03]Couldn't even protect yourself in your own fucking dungeon?
[177:02.65]In your own game, DM?
[177:04.27]You died in your own game?
[177:05.51]Wow!
[177:08.53]Where's his weapon?
[177:26.30]Fuck yourself.
[177:29.60]Alright, what do I got?
[177:31.10]I'm the gamekeeper now.
[177:32.42]It's my game.
[177:34.38]This is what I wanted.
[177:35.16]I wanted this whole outfit.
[177:43.29]There it is.
[177:44.33]Yes.
[177:47.29]Oh, that's so cool.
[177:49.27]I look like him now.
[177:55.63]What about the tights?
[177:58.41]I don't have any.
[178:00.96]Weapons.
[178:01.30]What does he have?
[178:03.34]Knight's Hunting Sword.
[178:04.42]40, 45.
[178:06.28]I guess it's a little... I mean, it's alright.
[178:08.78]I can give you some nice coin for that.
[178:10.64]Let's put some of this stuff away.
[178:21.42]Let's move to the horse.
[178:25.36]Let's get rid of the evidence.
[178:30.11]This is better than what I... I got this in the very beginning of the game, and nothing is better.
[178:33.67]Oh, the horse can't take anymore.
[178:37.86]Okay, that's fine.
[178:42.38]Streamer commits identity fraud.
[178:49.98]Streamer commits identity fraud.
[178:52.52]Just like in the Beetlejuice movie.
[178:55.67]What the fuck?! !
[178:57.73]Wait a minute!
[178:58.31]Hey!
[178:58.59]Whoa!
[178:59.87]What's going on?
[179:02.19]What?
[179:03.91]Wait a minute!
[179:04.85]What's going on?
[179:05.37]No!
[179:05.59]Speedo juice!
[179:06.53]Get off me!
[179:09.74]Ow!
[179:10.80]Hey, whoa!
[179:11.14]Come on!
[179:11.68]Jump right over there!
[179:34.30]I pushed him out the window.
[179:37.12]Is he dead?
[179:40.31]That is a huge splat outside the window down like 300 stories.
[179:43.23]Thank God.
[179:55.49]Hopefully I don't get in trouble for that one.
[180:01.78]Alright, look.
[180:03.17]What?
[180:04.37]Oh, shit.
[180:05.33]Oh, no.
[180:08.47]What am I gonna do about that?
[180:13.23]What the?
[180:14.01]Why?
[180:15.43]Why did he just do that?
[180:16.23]Why did my horse do that?
[180:17.73]Why did you do that?
[180:19.66]Why is my horse working for the enemy?
[180:27.48]Bad horse.
[180:29.40]Bad horse.
[180:41.41]Alright, I'm safe.
[180:45.03]What am I surrendering to?
[180:47.05]Surrender.
[180:48.38]Okay.
[180:49.24]Let's surrender.
[180:50.86]To who?
[180:54.48]There's nobody to surrender to.
[180:55.66]This guy's not even within a hundred yards of me.
[181:06.68]I fucked up my standing with that town.
[181:09.75]But at least I get to be the jester.
[181:17.38]Oh, come on.
[181:17.96]This is not... This has got to be passable, right?
[181:23.72]Really?
[181:24.04]Why is there a fucking wall here?
[181:25.50]Why is there an impassable briar patch right here?
[181:37.03]Impassable, my ass.
[181:44.74]Almost there.
[181:47.05]End of the map?
[181:47.61]That's not the end of the map.
[181:57.74]I like the Twin Peaks music.
[182:05.62]How do you like that one?
[182:09.32]What's going on in the lower left?
[182:10.36]Why is it the scream?
[182:13.43]Van Gogh painting, but the guy has a beard this time.
[182:17.13]What is that?
[182:17.59]Should I wait till that's done?
[182:23.20]What does that mean?
[182:23.72]Yeah, he's doing the not like this emote.
[182:44.05]This looked interesting.
[182:45.05]Let me take a look at it real quick.
[182:47.31]There's a tub in there.
[182:55.54]Not like this.
[183:00.34]You can look it up in the buffs.
[183:01.80]Probably a good idea.
[183:04.66]I need a new horse.
[183:05.30]Pebbles is great.
[183:05.96]Pebbles has been a really nice horse, but... I think it's time to move on.
[183:11.28]I want a faster horse.
[183:15.17]Look at that horse.
[183:19.90]Look at that jaw.
[183:21.98]It's a wonderful horse.
[183:23.52]Printed only on the HP.
[183:25.58]Deskjet 2100.
[183:27.72]Look at that horse.
[183:32.70]Look at that horse.
[183:37.96]Is this gonna... Let's slow it down here.
[183:52.43]Getting stuck in these little bushes is the worst thing.
[183:58.33]Nice jump.
[183:59.33]I knew you could do it, Pebbles.
[184:04.46]This place looks like it's having a little bit of a drought.
[184:12.67]Made it!
[184:13.65]Alright, I gotta find...
[184:30.22]What was I doing?
[184:31.00]Oh, okay, I gotta talk to this lady.
[184:35.24]Alright, I'm gonna stomp all over her garden.
[184:39.45]What was that?
[184:39.99]It was me.
[184:45.43]Riki!
[184:45.87]I'm looking for someone they call Riki.
[184:48.21]That's the Tanner's son, Hinnick.
[184:50.17]Where can I find him?
[184:52.44]Hard to say.
[184:53.06]He's not around here much.
[184:54.84]Thank God for some more blessings.
[184:57.38]He could try his folks' place.
[185:01.46]Okay.
[185:03.14]Talk to Riki's dad.
[185:12.26]Find Riki's place.
[185:16.43]Watch Riki be the guy I killed.
[185:17.85]Alright, Riki's father is down at B. Yeah, he was a funny little fellow.
[185:27.50]He liked to call himself the Gamekeeper.
[185:31.33]Him and his friends used to play Dungeons & Dragons all the time, and he said he was out roleplaying not that long ago.
[185:36.29]You may have come across him.
[185:37.11]He wears stuff just like what you have on.
[185:42.92]Instant throat slash, and then I would run away.
[185:51.48]This looks like my dad.
[185:53.24]I'm not going to knock him out.
[186:02.40]Good day to you.
[186:05.76]I'm looking for a fellow called Riki.
[186:07.84]Have you ever heard of him?
[186:09.51]Dunsons and dragons.
[186:11.37]Why wouldn't I?
[186:12.55]Raisins.
[186:13.55]Raisins and craisins.
[186:14.57]Ah.
[186:14.87]You wouldn't happen to know where he is, would you?
[186:17.77]I don't know nothing.
[186:19.69]Don't you at least know where he usually goes?
[186:21.87]It's important.
[186:22.97]Hinek shows up at home once in a blue moon, so I don't know nothing about where he gets to.
[186:28.79]Even if I did, why would I tell every Tom, Dick, and Harry?
[186:35.85]Listen, your son's in serious trouble.
[186:38.25]I'm trying to help him, and my patience is wearing extremely thin.
[186:42.41]If you start answering my questions, this is going to go a lot better for everyone.
[186:46.33]Are you threatening me?
[186:48.19]And I'm supposed to believe you want to help Hinek?
[186:50.07]Believe what you like.
[186:51.75]I'm concerned about Hinek, but I really don't much care what happens to you.
[186:54.96]Is that clear?
[186:56.42]Fuck it.
[186:57.66]I'm not going to take a beating on account of that good-for-nothing.
[187:00.66]So?
[187:02.80]That's my highest stat.
[187:03.98]My speech is so low.
[187:05.34]I'm the anti-poacher.
[187:06.04]Ow, my fucking teeth.
[187:32.36]God damn it.
[187:46.53]This is a cursed glass.
[187:48.71]I don't want this anymore.
[187:51.98]I just smashed my teeth to the glass going to take a sip.
[187:55.10]This glass is cursed.
[187:55.96]I'm throwing it in the trash.
[188:02.30]ah don't you have any clue at all where his hideout could be I really don't know nothing about that my front teeth I just that hurts because every time he brought some hides for tanning and money what more do you know nothing I swear to god almighty I've said all I know he never told me nothing
[188:28.11]Oh, uh, by the way.
[188:28.87]I'm gonna clean the fucking ketchup off your shirt, buddy.
[188:31.93]I know you had chocolate ice cream.
[188:32.99]How did you know?
[188:53.85]He had money because he sold the stuff right away.
[188:56.24]I suppose.
[188:58.00]You killed the gamekeeper that's required for this quest.
[189:01.66]No.
[189:02.80]But the innkeeper came here now.
[189:04.97]I am the gamekeeper now.
[189:06.43]Of course.
[189:08.11]That killed the gatekeeper.
[189:09.25]Okay.
[189:24.84]Is there something you need?
[189:25.82]I want to see if you can hear this.
[189:31.53]Hold on.
[189:32.57]Can you hear me hit my teeth on this glass?
[189:35.29]Much to go on, but it's better than nothing.
[189:38.71]Thank you.
[189:39.25]Oh my.
[189:39.61]Yeah, you can.
[189:40.59]You can hear like a... It's better than nothing.
[189:43.99]Thank you.
[189:48.31]There's like a... That was my teeth breaking.
[189:56.10]Alright, let's go.
[190:06.25]I need a walking stop.
[190:09.11]Stop.
[190:09.81]Alright, we got Reiki was selling poach game to the innkeeper.
[190:15.14]Or track down Reiki.
[190:16.56]Alright, the innkeeper.
[190:17.24]Right here.
[190:17.96]B. Back.
[190:20.30]Across.
[190:30.05]Oh, Ricky.
[190:37.41]Okay.
[190:42.03]Could have asked the gamekeeper about poaching.
[190:43.93]Well, maybe he should have minded his own fucking business.
[190:49.46]There it is.
[190:52.80]I want his hat.
[191:00.13]That's a lot.
[191:00.65]You're not murdering for his hat?
[191:02.38]He's got... I kind of like the aesthetic of that hat.
[191:04.18]Six plus three.
[191:26.14]Buying from poachers is a crime.
[191:28.99]I don't think this guy is that bright.
[191:30.05]I don't think he has nine speech intelligence.
[191:33.81]I don't give a damn what deals you've been doing together.
[191:36.71]I won't tell anyone.
[191:37.45]This hat looks like a cake.
[191:38.13]I want it.
[191:38.37]I just need to know where Riki is.
[191:40.33]It's urgent.
[191:41.25]What have our deals got to do with where he disappeared to?
[191:44.43]It reminds me of Toad.
[191:45.17]That guy has a Toad hat on.
[191:46.37]It's likely Riki is hiding out at his poaching lair.
[191:48.82]Believe me, it wasn't hard to find out who was buying game from him.
[191:52.22]And it's even easier to go to the castle and tell them.
[191:55.25]Poaching's a crime, after all.
[191:57.45]Alright, alright.
[191:58.56]Got it.
[191:59.44]Well, give me your word of honor.
[192:00.64]You won't tell anyone about our deal.
[192:02.50]You have my word.
[192:03.22]Fine.
[192:06.32]So, what do you want to know?
[192:07.32]Where's the band?
[192:10.24]Because they've been playing the whole time I've been going around this whole entire adventure.
[192:17.11]How much game did he bring you?
[192:19.32]Just turns around, there's just a whole band just following him the whole game.
[192:22.45]Code's hat is actually his head, though.
[192:24.99]That's canon that they... That's Expanded Universe that they made canon.
[192:30.13]No, I don't believe it.
[192:30.95]Don't buy it, please.
[192:31.61]How do you know that?
[192:46.92]Whenever Ricky was going poaching, he always came to me first for candles and lamp oil.
[192:51.62]He brought the game skin to gut it, so he had to have a light... It took him what?
[192:54.93]It took him 30 years to tell you that?
[192:57.63]No.
[192:58.09]Some intern at Nintendo said that out loud.
[193:01.35]Somebody heard about it and said, yeah, tweet that.
[193:04.04]No.
[193:04.78]Don't believe that.
[193:08.33]Yeah, that was funny, because remember back in the day when everyone said that you took Mario's hat off?
[193:12.87]Snakes would come out of his head because he didn't have hair?
[193:16.17]Mario originally didn't have hair.
[193:18.11]If you go back to it and you look at some of the documentaries about the original game, underneath that helmet, there was a fucking bunch of snakes.
[193:25.83]And Miyamoto said that he put it there to make his wife laugh.
[193:30.79]And they removed it in Mario 3, because he never noticed that the hat never comes off until Mario 3.
[193:38.31]Not a single word of that is true.
[194:04.80]Okay, find the cave to find the hideout.
[194:07.55]Thanks for all the help.
[194:09.41]I would like your fucking hat, please!
[194:16.15]It was a joke.
[194:16.90]It was a joke.
[194:17.42]I didn't right-click fast enough.
[194:21.80]Time to go.
[194:22.26]When do I have to go to the hideout?
[194:28.02]Get me out of here quick.
[194:33.75]Let's go, let's go before they remember me.
[194:38.49]Quickly, down to sea.
[194:39.63]I was trying to right click.
[194:49.62]Can you go in water as a horse?
[194:52.12]Can you?
[194:52.36]I guess.
[195:01.04]Is he gonna be alright?
[195:01.92]That's a loud thud.
[195:12.77]What the fuck?
[195:15.23]Somebody added me as a friend on... on what?
[195:18.61]What the hell are you talking about?
[195:20.05]I'm not even moving anymore.
[195:26.68]What is going on?
[195:29.88]Go back, go back, go back, go back.
[195:35.60]Why am I getting Microsoft Friend Additions?
[195:38.80]What the hell is this?
[195:40.96]Did they add a feature to this garbage operating system?
[195:43.28]Alright, here we go.
[195:53.58]Is there a camp right here?
[195:55.77]Is somebody sleeping in here?
[195:59.82]Hold on.
[196:05.43]Interesting.
[196:06.01]Okay.
[196:10.33]Looks like a good place to read.
[196:11.64]It was over here.
[196:19.72]Yeah, I'm gonna read.
[196:23.43]Let's finish the book.
[196:30.95]This side is pretty interesting, that's right, yeah.
[196:34.73]Alright, other... We've got Primer 2.
[196:38.08]Read.
[196:41.14]Finish the book.
[196:56.46]Baa, baa...
[197:00.46]Cool.
[197:01.24]Alright.
[197:01.76]Book is done.
[197:03.58]Did I get any skill points for that?
[197:07.67]Skills.
[197:08.63]Drinking.
[197:10.95]Okay, what do these do?
[197:12.71]The beer you get is 50% weaker so you can drink more, but wine is twice as strong.
[197:18.31]Under the influence of alcohol, your hand will shake 25% less and your bow skill is higher.
[197:22.21]Okay.
[197:23.99]Let's just do this just because it seems the most useful out of them all.
[197:31.85]Um, anymore combat, defense.
[197:35.01]You've learned how to do a perfect block.
[197:37.41]Right.
[197:38.67]Blocking an opponent's strikes with your shield will cost him more stamina.
[197:42.32]If you beat your opponent in a clinch, you'll damage his weapon 15% more.
[197:45.70]A damaged weapon will cause much less damage, as well as its price being greatly reduced.
[197:50.34]I don't know if I want to do that, though.
[197:58.52]You have to drink to shoot arrows.
[197:59.72]Yeah, that's fine.
[198:01.00]I have plenty of alcohol.
[198:02.00]I have like 30 fucking wines on me.
[198:03.84]I have like 25 beers on me.
[198:08.88]I don't know what I want to do here.
[198:15.65]Let's just do firm grip.
[198:21.57]I don't want to break the weapon because I've been stealing everybody's weapons.
[198:23.95]And strength.
[198:25.67]Strength.
[198:27.35]Carrying dead or unconscious bodies won't cost you stamina.
[198:31.47]Gives you a one-third higher chance of overpowering your opponent in a clinch.
[198:37.18]Or you can deplete an opponent's health and stamina by bumping into him at a sprint.
[198:44.86]You have a 10% greater chance of knocking out an opponent with a blow to the head.
[198:50.02]Your attacks cost 20% greater damage but cost you 10% more stamina.
[198:56.22]I don't even care.
[198:58.66]That's the most important thing for me right now.
[199:00.04]I'm carrying so many things.
[199:03.21]Still can't do anything with reading.
[199:05.87]Halfway there.
[199:10.59]Alright.
[199:12.57]Get out.
[199:19.61]More free stuff.
[199:22.53]Fire anything else around here?
[199:23.59]There's an interesting sight.
[199:24.57]Let's see.
[199:31.76]Is it like a dead body?
[199:34.57]Blood?
[199:35.85]Sign of a struggle?
[199:37.51]Guys, bones?
[199:39.71]What else we got here?
[199:42.87]Hey, look at all these bones.
[199:45.49]Look at these.
[199:47.59]That's like a hip bone.
[199:48.63]There's some really large animals here that died too.
[199:52.95]It was like a slaughter apparently.
[199:54.05]Jesus.
[199:55.99]Look at all these torsos and legs and femurs.
[199:58.37]This is crazy.
[199:59.35]This might be the remnants of a war.
[200:03.32]If I were to take, like, an educated guess.
[200:04.70]Let's go.
[200:20.77]Horsemanship.
[200:21.83]I can do some horsemanship.
[200:25.25]That was the worst you've ever heard?
[200:27.33]Really?
[200:27.95]You might not have been around here for quite that long.
[200:31.89]Is it chest?
[200:34.84]There wasn't a chest.
[200:40.08]Incoming joke.
[200:40.92]What joke do you think I'm gonna do?
[200:43.76]Go to the B marker.
[200:44.80]Why?
[200:47.38]There wasn't a chest.
[200:51.19]Find the cave in the hills.
[200:52.39]I mean, I'm at D right now.
[200:55.47]I'm gonna go to D. I'll put the horseman perk in in a minute.
[201:09.80]an interesting site again.
[201:15.08]Looks pretty interesting.
[201:22.21]Okay.
[201:34.36]I recognize this.
[201:37.03]That's the thing you take from Gnomeregon, and wow.
[201:39.85]That's the gnome teleportation device drill.
[201:43.31]There's one in Molten Core.
[201:44.35]There's one in that takes you- yeah, that's pretty cool.
[201:47.86]There must be an instance here somewhere.
[201:55.80]Wait, Honey!
[201:58.06]He's on fire today!
[202:03.01]Can I actually get Honey?
[202:05.22]Ooh, I can get honey.
[202:06.62]Honey.
[202:11.78]Somebody just left this here for free.
[202:14.98]No honey in this one?
[202:17.72]You bees aren't producing.
[202:18.72]Oh well.
[202:29.97]Deep.
[202:34.11]I think I don't even need to be on the horse.
[202:35.33]It's right here.
[202:41.12]Sasso Woods.
[202:44.24]Almost there.
[202:52.50]Am I almost there?
[202:53.20]Okay, maybe I am gonna get on the horse.
[202:59.26]Yeah, I'm sorry, but let's just make it fester.
[203:02.19]Let's make it fester.
[203:09.94]This kind of gives me anxiety doing this.
[203:11.48]Okay, found it.
[203:20.55]This is the first quest in The Witcher 3.
[203:23.17]Some old lady's gonna come out of here and yell at me.
[203:26.55]Find the shaft.
[203:32.17]Found it.
[203:34.78]Where's my torch?
[203:45.35]What's the point of this?
[203:52.50]I can't go past these rocks.
[203:54.06]Okay.
[203:54.92]I just had to find it.
[203:59.50]Oh, no.
[204:07.90]Smooth.
[204:10.16]Well, it was the wrong one.
[204:10.92]Let's wrap around.
[204:23.38]C... B... Alright, let's go to B. This is far.
[204:31.81]Is anything even close?
[204:32.81]I'm gonna fast travel.
[204:34.91]Because that's too fucking far.
[204:42.18]Oh, another guy!
[204:54.96]Is there a guy?
[204:55.46]I don't see anybody.
[205:00.75]What's fucking wrong with my horse?
[205:02.29]Where's the guy?
[205:02.75]Oh, well.
[205:07.23]Oh, it's still... I don't know.
[205:12.31]Please don't... Please never interrupt me again.
[205:17.91]Turn up the control aim sensitivity?
[205:20.69]No, it's where I like it.
[205:26.09]Now on the way to B. I think I'm hungry.
[205:30.61]I'm starting to get hungry.
[205:39.72]Straight ahead.
[205:41.70]Good jump.
[205:43.94]Good jump, part two.
[205:44.68]Alright, stay on the road.
[205:53.92]It takes me 30 seconds to turn around on the horse.
[205:55.70]30 seconds, huh?
[205:56.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 seconds.
[205:56.62]More like 11, because I couldn't go the whole way.
[205:57.80]Wait, where am I going?
[206:00.44]This way?
[206:01.44]Up here.
[206:30.17]Christ.
[206:41.33]No, don't get off the horse.
[206:42.13]Get back on.
[206:46.07]Get on the horse.
[206:54.25]Come here.
[207:01.42]I don't take the long way, guys.
[207:04.84]You want me to wrap around the whole entire map?
[207:08.17]This is the way that we go the fastest.
[207:11.91]It would probably take 12 minutes of riding and looking at stuff.
[207:16.09]No.
[207:16.81]We're going the way that it gets us there quick and to the point.
[207:20.03]It's right here.
[207:23.03]Alright, here he is.
[207:32.08]Found him.
[207:42.61]It looks like artificial light coming out of there.
[207:46.59]Choices matter.
[207:46.97]Oh, what is that?
[207:58.16]At least you have no more cares.
[208:00.80]This guy's like torturing an animal.
[208:04.88]Don't kill me.
[208:05.70]I can explain.
[208:06.27]I just controlled his mind.
[208:10.75]I swear I've no one to tell anyway.
[208:13.57]Just please don't kill me.
[208:15.59]I'm not planning to kill you.
[208:17.39]Yes, I am.
[208:17.83]You're not one of Runt's men.
[208:19.37]No.
[208:22.92]Then who are you?
[208:32.97]The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[208:34.77]I'm the game master.
[208:47.50]I was, but I've got nothing in common with those bastards.
[208:50.74]I'll take your word for it, providing you tell me what you know.
[208:53.32]I don't know why you should care.
[208:54.87]If it keeps my neck out of the noose, I'll spill the beans.
[208:57.33]It won't.
[208:57.59]That Neuhof raid of yours didn't turn out quite as planned, did it?
[209:01.41]Depends on whose plan you're talking about.
[209:03.69]We were up to it to grab some loot and bugger off.
[209:06.27]Only Rod's cutthroat was there to shed blood.
[209:08.39]Yeah, you went off script.
[209:09.59]Game master is not pleased.
[209:10.93]There were two gangs there.
[209:12.59]Look behind you.
[209:13.05]He's like slaughtering an animal behind him.
[209:14.83]This guy's a real psycho.
[209:38.77]And when they said we was gonna kill anything what moved, then we knew there was no going back.
[209:47.87]Who got your two gangs together?
[209:49.88]You must have made contact somehow, right?
[209:51.76]Pius.
[209:52.72]He comes to us and says he's got this prime job.
[209:56.36]We're gonna rob a farm, he says.
[209:58.96]Maybe he's making jerky.
[210:00.32]Psychopaths eat meat.
[210:00.90]A hunting kill being dressed.
[210:01.70]No, that's the flayed house.
[210:03.38]That's the flayed man of House Bolton back there.
[210:05.40]This guy was being a sicko about it.
[210:23.13]You do it quick.
[210:24.34]You don't like string him up and talk to him.
[210:26.44]Remember we walked in, he was like, yeah, you can't say anything.
[210:29.22]You don't know what you're talking about.
[210:30.90]You can.
[210:31.32]He has a knife in his hand.
[210:32.18]He's being a real creep about it.
[210:34.84]That gang of yours, what can you tell me about them?
[210:37.38]Don't know what you want to know.
[210:39.20]There was four of us.
[210:40.36]Me, Timmy, Limpy Lubosh, and Pius Pava.
[210:43.66]Sometimes we'd rob a place or hold up pilgrims.
[210:46.42]Never nothing fancy.
[210:48.02]I'm sure you did mischief enough.
[210:50.23]Who led you?
[210:51.27]Pius.
[210:51.97]He's only going after the genitals.
[210:53.99]Yeah, what a creep.
[210:56.17]He's like mutilating this deer.
[210:57.53]He's like going after the genitals.
[210:59.31]What about the thigh meat?
[211:00.57]What about the meat on the neck?
[211:02.21]No, he wants to go straight for the genitals.
[211:03.71]Brain.
[211:05.43]This is some Jeffrey Dahmer crazy guy shit.
[211:08.49]Fucking Ted Bundy asshole.
[211:11.43]It kind of looks like Ted Bundy.
[211:13.22]This might be Ted Bundy with a mustache.
[211:14.44]Fake mustache.
[211:15.36]This guy's dead.
[211:17.12]Where did the rest of your gang end up?
[211:19.26]You saw Limpy, right?
[211:21.40]Yes, but he's no use to me now.
[211:24.47]Tell me where I can find Pius or Timmy.
[211:26.67]I don't know nothing about Pius.
[211:28.75]He vanished in the woods, and I haven't seen him since.
[211:32.08]Timmy, I reckon, went back to the mill where he worked.
[211:34.48]Which mill?
[211:36.94]The windmill a bit north of Northern.
[211:39.96]Hey, thanks, buddy.
[211:43.52]Tell me more.
[211:44.18]You just want an excuse to kill him.
[212:12.16]Yeah, I'm gonna choke this guy out and I'm gonna loot his body.
[212:15.74]And there's gonna be fake mustache in the menu list of items.
[212:18.73]I'm gonna go like, and pull it off.
[212:20.11]Alright, give me more details.
[212:36.09]Well, we stormed in from the rear.
[212:38.75]Runt's people started slaughtering the horses.
[212:41.37]Jesus, that was bleeding horrible.
[212:43.94]Meanwhile, me and Limpy had a sniff around the stables to see if we could find anything worth pilfering.
[212:49.92]And in the end, we got lucky.
[212:52.66]What did you find?
[212:54.98]Smilled Sir Hanish's groom.
[212:57.13]I don't know why he was up, what he was doing in the stables.
[213:00.61]Eight deer genitals jerking.
[213:03.89]That was fucking funny.
[213:04.97]No!
[213:27.59]I'm gaping at smell, stuck through and through, and I notice this boy standing at the other end of the stables.
[213:33.73]The stupid sod's pointing at us, jaw hanging down to his knees, saying, I know you.
[213:39.35]Runt turns to us and hisses.
[213:41.35]Take him down.
[213:42.67]So me and Lubos start running, because the lad took to his heels.
[213:47.07]At the same time, we could hear the noise of the skirmish in the courtyard.
[213:50.84]We caught up with the boy at the next farmhouse.
[213:53.53]knock him to the ground but he bashes me with some piece of iron so hard my head's ringing like a fucking church bell limpy grabs it off him and stands over him with his bodkin in his hand and I start praying in the end limpy just gives him a kick and says beat it ginger yep and then run shows up at the gate hollers that we gotta go is this guy telling me a story is this a narration on like a Stephen king movie you know what I mean like what like what happened after the raid
[214:17.48]We were waiting for that fool, Timmy.
[214:20.20]Same place as we met them before, so he'd know where we were, right?
[214:23.98]Stupid fucking idea.
[214:25.92]But Pius didn't want to leave him behind.
[214:27.76]Only when Timmy finally turned up, two of Runt's men were dragging him.
[214:32.78]There was some difference of opinion.
[214:35.13]You could say that, yeah.
[214:37.49]Someone fighting outside the cave.
[214:39.55]Are they?
[214:40.45]They started trying to surround us, and we knew what was coming.
[214:43.31]What?
[214:47.32]Limpy took his bodkin and let that fucker have it in the belly.
[214:50.79]Runs.
[214:53.25]One of the others.
[214:54.53]Timmy broke free from them and we all took to our heels.
[214:57.51]Luckily, they were so buggered from the raid, they didn't follow us for long.
[215:00.61]I don't think anyone's paying attention.
[215:03.95]Not even me.
[215:06.20]That's good.
[215:07.58]That'll do.
[215:08.34]That's all I need to know.
[215:10.26]So now what do I do with you?
[215:12.04]Well...
[215:20.02]There are people out there.
[215:20.82]I can take him on.
[215:24.35]Fuck.
[215:40.84]That's what I would say.
[215:42.38]So I'm going to do some stealth kills here.
[215:45.34]I'm going to be ready for the arrows.
[215:49.39]I have to drink to be better with arrows though, right?
[216:13.58]Let's go with food.
[216:14.34]Uh, wine.
[216:15.92]Alright, I'm like shit-faced.
[216:21.26]Okay, I'm ready.
[216:25.84]Where's my light?
[216:27.96]Hey, he's just going in there.
[216:30.30]What the fuck is going- Why are my hands up?
[216:36.66]It's so dark.
[216:43.17]Where did he go?
[216:43.65]Wait, he just ran away.
[216:44.59]He ran from me.
[216:48.51]Where is he?
[216:53.40]Where did he go?
[216:53.80]I'm not going to let him get away.
[216:57.38]You've got to be kidding me.
[217:09.18]He left me.
[217:16.05]You asshole.
[217:20.01]I'm gonna die.
[217:26.76]Yeah, fuck this.
[217:32.84]In darkness.
[217:36.28]In darkness!
[217:43.41]Just like Batman.
[217:48.00]I literally can't do this alone.
[217:55.06]I can't even fucking see.

[221:09.30]Where did he go?
[221:09.87]Where did the other guy go?
[221:10.75]This is a trail of dead bodies.
[221:12.09]I just spotted...
[221:20.56]I definitely did.
[221:21.44]You can't tell me that wasn't what that was.
[221:22.82]Okay, hold on.
[221:28.94]I need to heal.
[221:31.60]Heal.
[221:34.60]Where's my bandages?
[221:39.68]Oh, shit.
[221:41.46]I don't think I have bandages.
[221:43.90]Yes, I do.
[221:44.28]Thank God.
[221:53.22]Alright, I'm fine.
[221:54.30]Now I need to... I need to drink... Something?
[221:57.68]I'm gonna drink a potion.
[221:59.94]Eat an apple.
[222:00.40]Alright, we do Marigold, which is the heal.
[222:08.03]There it is.
[222:10.61]Alright, slowly let's just rest.
[222:21.59]Where am I supposed to go now?
[222:29.74]Another body.
[222:31.32]No.
[222:36.72]Everything's fine.
[222:42.56]There was a big rabbit there, you're right.
[222:43.81]But I don't have time for that right now.
[222:46.95]I need to just sit.
[222:47.69]I'm gonna sit right here.
[223:01.78]Okay.
[223:03.18]Almost there.
[223:08.21]Where's my trusty companion?
[223:10.83]Okay.
[223:11.37]Mount.
[223:12.23]Let's go.
[223:13.81]We got the information we needed.
[223:14.91]Now we need to go to... Where?
[223:18.67]Exactly.
[223:21.41]This is... Inquire after Timmy at the windmill.
[223:26.61]That's not that far.
[223:28.89]Here we go.
[223:35.79]This is tough.
[223:39.56]What is that?
[223:41.78]What is that?
[223:44.40]Holy shit, it's an animal.
[223:45.80]Hold on, wait.
[223:50.30]There are just animals everywhere in here.
[223:51.77]I mean, it is the woods, right?
[224:00.93]What?
[224:01.19]What do you mean, what am I doing here?
[224:03.07]Who's this?
[224:04.33]What is happening?
[224:06.71]Okay, this is just a random guy.
[224:08.01]Oh, I got hit in the fucking face with an arrow.
[224:13.87]Get out of here.
[224:14.43]Please move the horse.
[224:18.69]Oh my fucking god.
[224:21.81]I'm just shit-faced riding around on a horse.
[224:23.82]Is there anybody else here besides this guy?
[224:26.84]Where is he?
[224:31.58]There he is.
[224:40.31]Get off the horse.
[224:43.03]Holy shit.
[224:45.72]I gotta run.
[224:47.44]Run this way.
[224:51.12]They're killing my horse.
[224:53.90]Fuck.
[224:54.90]Fuck.
[224:55.66]Fuck.
[224:56.38]Fuck.
[224:57.28]Fuck.
[224:58.27]Fuck.
[225:00.21]I'm crawling around.
[225:05.49]Oh boy, wait a minute.
[225:13.17]I think I'm dead.
[225:22.93]Where's my sword?
[225:28.80]Where am I?
[225:31.64]Come on, come on horse!
[225:36.91]I'm dead.
[225:47.36]I told you to run!
[225:48.40]My screen!
[225:49.54]My screen was just like red and orange.
[225:55.50]Give me a fucking break.
[225:58.72]I can't believe I have to fucking do this again.
[226:07.86]Oh my fucking lord, give me a break.
[226:31.92]Swing!
[226:33.34]Swing!
[226:33.72]I was gonna run, I don't even care.
[226:38.97]I'm gonna kill this guy and then run away.
[226:40.93]Who gives a shit about that little, like, pissy little boy?
[226:44.23]Whatever his name is.
[226:51.21]Yeah, you got a shield.
[226:52.07]I don't.
[227:02.14]Get out of my fucking life.
[227:10.39]Give me a swing.
[227:24.17]Fucking done.
[227:26.63]Aye aye aye.
[227:37.90]Now, let's play the mirror game.
[227:48.84]I'm done.
[227:49.16]This is just never gonna end.
[228:03.15]This is so much easier when you're running through the woods like a moron.
[228:31.39]Fuck yourself, buddy.
[228:33.13]To hell with you.
[228:48.62]You're dead.
[228:49.00]This is so stupid.
[228:56.89]The problem is that I'm not drunk.
[228:59.13]Call that combat.
[229:00.44]Yeah, I do.
[229:01.66]I call this, like, pitch black fighting and just knocking arrows into you.
[229:06.88]I'm gonna have to, like, start this again.
[229:12.27]Holy shit, this is stupid.
[229:22.13]Come on!
[229:25.43]Quit it!
[229:30.13]I'm too close.
[229:41.50]I learned a new point.
[229:42.80]I got a new point in defense.
[229:48.02]No.
[229:48.90]No, it's just you have a shield, so this makes it, like, not fair.
[229:52.88]I'm just, like, laughing about this whole fucking thing.
[229:56.26]It's just like, fuck this.
[229:58.26]Honest to god, it was better when I had the fucking arrow out.
[230:13.68]I'm just running.
[230:15.99]This is absolutely fucking moronic.
[230:22.57]What is, like, supposed to happen here?
[230:26.14]What is, like, the thing that is actually supposed to happen?
[230:29.68]No, I'm loading.
[230:30.52]No, no, no, don't start at the very beginning of the game.
[230:37.97]Learn to fight!
[230:41.81]You can't... We're just supposed to walk into them.
[230:45.35]You fight them.
[230:46.85]With this guy that has no armor and sucks and just runs.
[230:49.27]I have to fight three people at the same time.
[230:53.53]Look at this!
[230:54.19]Look at how fucking stupid this is!
[230:55.81]He's not doing anything!
[230:57.43]Why?!
[230:58.27]What the fuck?!
[230:59.47]Oh my- I'm just gonna follow his lead, because I have to fight three guys at the same time.
[231:07.38]Give me my horse.
[231:08.36]I'm fucking outta here.
[231:12.98]How did you guys get- Where are we?
[231:16.41]Where are we?!
[231:18.91]Oh shit!
[231:20.09]Watch the horse!
[231:28.07]Ladies and gentlemen.
[231:30.39]This is dumb.
[231:33.29]This is dumb.
[231:34.73]I'm literally just spamming right click.
[231:36.89]And it's doing a better job than fighting them for real.
[231:44.26]Now I'm gonna die.
[231:44.90]I was trying to prove a shitty point, now I'm gonna lose.
[231:48.14]I can't do it.
[232:10.34]Am I bleeding?
[232:10.80]I'm bleeding.
[232:20.83]Come on!
[232:25.26]I did the same thing you did!
[232:42.72]Pass the controller.
[232:44.58]Why am I staring at the sky?
[232:45.52]I'm killing all these guys right now.
[232:46.66]I'm not gonna get it once.
[232:47.50]I promise.
[232:48.36]100%.
[232:48.72]No, put the take- put the sword out.
[232:53.06]Stupid.
[232:54.98]Where are we?
[232:57.04]What's going on?
[232:57.58]Get me off the fucking rock.
[232:59.32]Oh my fucking god.
[233:00.31]I'm like stuck in a rock.
[233:01.89]Well, there's my guarantee.
[233:25.54]Streamer breaks his promise on stream.
[233:35.77]Swing.
[233:36.73]Somebody swing.
[233:47.65]Watch it.
[233:47.99]This guy's gonna hit me.
[233:52.11]Fuck outta here.
[234:34.82]Dick!
[234:35.68]Fuck the shield!
[234:42.32]Guy with the shield, like, I can't deal with him.
[234:46.75]I have to use some fucking fireballs.
[235:03.19]Do I have a different weapon?
[235:20.90]Gotta level up.
[235:23.00]Alright, swing your sword.
[235:23.80]No, that didn't work.
[235:27.40]Try it again.
[235:30.43]Do it again.
[235:36.03]Lord.
[235:37.51]Oh my god.
[235:38.57]I... Oh my god.
[235:39.53]I'm gonna have a fucking meltdown.
[235:41.61]Oh my god.
[235:42.79]Fuck that sh... Oh my god.
[235:45.73]It's so annoying.
[235:50.80]Holy shit.
[235:54.90]Give me a fucking break.
[235:57.80]I hate this.
[235:58.80]I'm just running.
[236:07.23]I'm just running.
[236:08.07]I'm running.
[236:09.23]This is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
[236:10.73]I'm running.
[236:15.65]Just get me out of here.
[236:19.64]Get me the fuck out of this.
[236:20.46]I can't beat this dude.
[236:21.54]One on one.
[236:22.44]Or three on one.
[236:25.10]Get me out of here.
[236:25.58]Where am I?
[236:27.50]Just ride away.
[236:28.06]Who cares?
[236:28.42]Go.
[236:28.90]I'm not gonna fight three fucking... What happened?
[236:35.39]What?
[236:37.61]Oh my god, he won't leave me alone.
[236:38.73]This guy won't leave me alone.
[236:40.55]I can't get away from him.
[236:47.39]He knocked me off the horse.
[236:52.78]The horse broke his fucking legs.
[237:01.76]This guy has so many more moves than me.
[237:03.88]Why do you have more moves than me?
[237:15.05]Faint and hit head.
[237:16.03]Alright, I'm gonna do exactly what you just said.
[237:32.55]This shield is too fast.
[237:40.51]I'm gonna uninstall this game on stream.
[237:45.74]That's not a feint, that's a jaw.
[237:46.88]What do I mean a feint?
[238:03.45]I skipped the training.
[238:06.98]Good luck.
[238:07.60]Good luck.
[238:07.92]Get the fuck out of my way.
[238:09.14]Give me the horse.
[238:09.78]Please get me out of this.
[238:10.72]This is un-fucking-bearable.
[238:12.04]Please, God, get me out of this.
[238:13.72]Give me the horse.
[238:14.34]Where's my horse?
[238:15.58]Where's my horse?
[238:16.60]No.
[238:16.86]No, God.
[238:20.77]I called these guys.
[238:22.19]I want my horse.
[238:34.01]This really is a found footage horror movie.
[238:39.84]So I have to go back to Bernard and learn how to do other moves.
[238:43.14]Before I can fight this guy.
[238:45.34]The impossible to kill guy that I have to hit from behind.
[238:47.46]I'm just gonna go in the cave, man.
[239:00.47]Go.
[239:09.30]Holy shit.
[239:20.43]I don't even fucking care where I end up.
[239:21.99]That was the worst experience of my whole life.
[239:24.01]Alright, please get me out of here.
[239:38.77]Like in my entire life.
[239:40.33]I've been hit by a car before, and that was worse than getting hit by a car.
[239:52.86]Alright, where am I going?
[239:58.82]Like, I've actually been hit by a car going like 15 miles per hour.
[240:03.28]Like, fast enough where it was a huge deal.
[240:06.59]That wasn't even... I would have rather have get hit by a car than do what I just did.
[240:12.69]That was like a miserable three days.
[240:13.81]He was going 50.
[240:40.59]Yeah, 50 miles per hour, that's really fast for a person.
[240:44.56]If you get hit by a fucking car at 15, you can die.
[240:50.36]Ignore.
[241:08.52]So you talk... Let me just defend myself here.
[241:12.81]You're talking about this, right?
[241:16.97]So I have a weapon out, right?
[241:18.47]You're talking about holding down, like slash, and then moving in a different direction and letting go and slashing from a different direction.
[241:26.45]He blocked it every time.
[241:29.40]That sucked.
[241:30.34]I couldn't hit him.
[241:35.26]Like this.
[241:52.34]You're talking about this.
[241:58.73]So I have my sword up here.
[241:59.55]I'm going to swing.
[242:00.15]No, I'm not.
[242:00.59]I'm coming from underneath.
[242:01.81]That's what you're talking about.
[242:06.57]What's he doing?
[242:11.25]Why are you doing this?
[242:16.68]Bugger.
[242:19.49]I'm so like just tilted right now.
[242:21.99]It has to be during bullet time.
[242:23.50]It has to be during bullet time?
[242:40.78]Learn one combo and just beat the whole game.
[242:42.48]Hold on, let me look.
[242:49.40]Don't telegraph your swings.
[242:51.86]He's not a raid party.
[242:53.18]It's a fucking AI.
[243:05.23]He's actually fainting.
[243:06.39]Thank you.
[243:06.83]I actually am doing that.
[243:14.72]Oh my God, I'm back here.
[243:17.57]Go to the fucking character screen, you donkey.
[243:28.45]Left, bottom right, middle.
[243:31.17]Slash, slash, stab.
[243:32.85]I'm going to do that over and over again.
[243:40.77]What's that?
[243:42.65]The pig turns up willingly.
[243:45.59]Is that all you got?
[243:54.67]Shit.
[243:56.17]Oh, God.
[243:56.61]Just fighting two people at the same time is just monstrous.
[243:59.33]It's a monstrous feat.
[244:03.69]I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
[244:05.03]Slash.
[244:05.99]Slash.
[244:06.89]Stab.
[244:07.37]No, it's not.
[244:08.72]It has to be in the middle.
[244:09.36]How do you get it just to be right in the middle?
[244:12.54]This is good combat training, at least.
[244:22.10]I missed what?
[244:22.74]Why?
[244:23.20]Oh.
[244:23.31]Oh.
[244:29.13]I don't think I'm just watching.
[244:30.31]That guy's just like having... That guy's you.
[244:32.21]Those are you guys right there.
[244:38.88]You guys are just watching and laughing at this.
[244:40.46]Oh, fuck.
[245:10.00]We're winning.
[245:10.66]I don't... Honest to God, that guy's not possible to beat.
[245:22.02]I don't think it is.
[245:22.96]Somebody take my controller and beat this guy, because that is not possible.
[245:30.71]I'm going to tell you my new strategy.
[245:35.17]This is the strategy now.
[245:47.10]Come on, something to hide behind.
[245:51.27]Try to kick the shield?
[245:52.23]I can't kick.
[245:53.93]I don't even have it equipped.
[245:55.99]I don't have the kick shoes on.
[246:00.71]Oh, fuck.
[246:01.17]It's black in here.
[246:22.23]Alright, we're safe.
[246:26.39]Yeah.
[246:27.19]Alright, watch.
[246:29.17]Ready?
[246:29.77]No!
[246:30.07]God damn it!
[246:34.92]My kick is left trigger.
[246:37.14]But it doesn't seem to work anymore.
[246:38.50]Why?
[246:43.24]Kick left trigger.
[246:45.76]I was trying to do it.
[246:46.34]It wasn't doing anything.
[246:49.70]Can I not have my torch on?
[247:01.27]Ayayay.
[247:04.91]Can I just fast travel right now, please?
[247:07.70]Just can I be over this fucking nightmare?
[247:10.80]Literally in 15 hours, the only enemy in the whole game that's given me that much trouble.
[247:15.62]Besides the very first guy I ever fought.
[247:23.74]That wasn't fair.
[247:24.29]That guy was like 15 levels higher than me.
[247:26.55]Like, coming to be an asshole in PvP.
[247:30.88]I'm just going straight here.
[247:49.92]The drunk guy.
[247:50.36]Yeah, that was the guy.
[247:50.94]That was the first enemy in the whole game I ever came across.
[247:56.14]This guy and that guy 16 hours ago are the only people I couldn't deal with.
[248:02.78]I feel quite hungry.
[248:03.70]Oh, shut up.
[248:04.68]You'll eat when I tell you you can.
[248:08.30]And I actually... I did end up killing that guy.
[248:10.66]Because I shot an arrow in the back of his head.
[248:24.04]Why am I locked in?
[248:28.68]out of this.
[248:30.12]Where the fuck is this?
[248:31.44]And now I'm stuck here.
[248:44.58]I don't even know where the fuck I am right now.
[248:47.40]I'm going to get off the horse and whistle for him.
[248:50.48]You can't wait till I fight the boss?
[248:51.48]I bet you I beat the boss first try.
[248:53.50]I will bet $100.
[248:54.76]$100 goes to charity either way.
[248:58.26]I'll beat him first try.
[249:02.40]Guaranteed.
[249:08.61]I'm going to kick this guy's ass right now.
[249:21.48]I have to stay on the fucking roads.
[249:27.62]Come on, you can't jump a tree.
[249:28.74]What kind of horse are you?
[249:34.58]Oh my God.
[249:35.50]I have to eat.
[249:50.83]I don't even care if it's rotten, you'll be fine.
[249:57.33]Why am I poisoned?
[249:59.11]Now I got poison in my blood.
[250:06.52]Like, I have to go, like... I hate staying on roads.
[250:10.26]I hate it.
[250:12.28]Just give me a fucking mulcher and let me just drive through with a lawnmower.
[250:23.93]It's rotten.
[250:25.03]That guy just fucked me up so bad.
[250:27.16]That guy threw me off.
[250:31.08]Honestly, that was like a funny scenario, and then I started, I hated every second of that after that.
[250:36.48]That was like a hysterical scenario.
[250:38.00]I should have just fucking deleted my save file after that and tried it again.
[250:57.22]There's no fast travel to this place.
[250:59.60]From the start?
[251:00.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[251:01.16]From, like, 40 minutes ago.
[251:03.52]What the hell is this?
[251:15.21]No, the Riddler.
[251:16.69]That depends.
[251:27.08]A wager over what?
[251:28.30]It's simple.
[251:29.64]I tell you a riddle.
[251:30.94]If you solve it, you get back twice the sum you wager.
[251:34.45]Okay.
[251:34.95]If you don't, I get to keep your coin.
[251:38.41]That sounds good.
[251:39.41]Let's do it.
[251:40.65]Now, listen carefully.
[251:42.89]In the feast hall on the table are ten candles.
[251:47.33]Suddenly, a gutter... Three.
[251:52.67]Is the correct answer...
[251:57.28]Thanks.
[251:57.56]Bye.
[252:26.12]My brain just goes so much faster than the average human that... I knew what the rest of the question was before you even asked it.
[252:35.91]I did the numbers in my head in about a quarter of a tenth of a second.
[252:40.59]It happened so fast, I didn't even see it, you know?
[252:54.55]Is this the boss?
[252:57.48]Which one of these is the boss?
[253:02.14]Hmm?
[253:03.56]Sure, should I just kill the whole village and be done with it and make sure I get it done?
[253:11.28]And you can't be the guy with the shield.
[253:14.60]Yeah, that was bullshit.
[253:17.60]That was just total... That was dog shit.
[253:28.32]I want your necklace.
[253:29.12]My blood is Szechuan sauce?
[253:29.96]Sounds good.
[253:30.22]I need to sleep.
[253:55.65]I hope you don't mind if I sleep in your dirty barn on your haystack.
[253:58.97]Is this his bed?
[253:59.93]Fuck it is.
[254:04.35]No, don't kill him for the bed.
[254:05.99]That's not worth it.
[254:06.79]Stop using your rage as a tool.
[254:09.81]Just find another place to sleep with the cows.
[254:14.49]Sleep in, like, the trough.
[254:20.70]Don't let your anger dictate, like, the course of action that you can't take right now.
[254:36.09]There has to be an empty bed in here somewhere.
[254:45.74]Empty bed?
[254:46.16]No.
[254:48.02]Alright, do I have a fast travel point here now that I know where it is?
[254:55.10]No.
[255:00.41]Shit, that's not good.
[255:09.44]I might have to... Oh, that sucks.
[255:11.36]I'm all the way up here already.
[255:12.86]I can't... But I can go here, though.
[255:15.01]That sucks that I have to do this, but I kind of do.
[255:16.99]I mean, I could... Wait, what's my energy at right now?
[255:22.89]It's not terrible.
[255:24.35]At least let me sit down.
[255:33.18]Is there any... I can't, like, just sleep in here?
[255:37.20]No, I'm not gonna kill the guy for his bed.
[255:39.08]So that's bad manners.
[255:50.83]The arrow strategy.
[255:52.41]No, I gotta like cool down after losing to shield guys like seven times in a row.
[256:05.96]That's bad manners.
[256:15.46]I don't have any books to read, unfortunately.
[256:18.10]I might need to wait a little longer.
[256:27.55]Go get a shield so I can be a shield guy.
[256:29.53]I killed the guy for his hat.
[256:35.37]No, I didn't.
[256:35.83]Excuse me.
[256:36.27]I tried to shoot the guy, but then I made a joke that I wasn't going to shoot him.
[256:40.69]And then I knocked the arrow behind him.
[256:42.90]That guy's still alive.
[256:51.26]Alright, let's get some more info.
[256:54.50]Hi.
[256:55.78]We need to talk.
[256:57.66]I'm looking for a Colossus by the name of Timmy.
[257:00.18]I heard he works here.
[257:01.80]I don't know anyone like that.
[257:07.28]Listen, and listen well.
[257:08.94]It'll be better for everybody if you tell me.
[257:11.00]I'll be happy to know where I can find him.
[257:13.47]You'll be happy I don't have to get nasty with you and Timmy.
[257:16.51]I'm sure Timmy will be happy to stay alive.
[257:19.13]You...
[257:20.69]I've just been, like, raging.
[257:24.69]This guy just rages, too.
[257:27.29]I'm going to go train with Lenard after this.
[257:29.49]Don't worry.
[257:32.84]Behind the mill.
[257:36.78]Are you coming?
[257:40.62]Don't close the door on me.
[257:41.60]What are you doing?
[257:42.44]Hello, don't...
[257:52.54]Hurry up, hurry up, I'm here, I'm behind the mill.
[257:54.78]Get over here, hurry up.
[258:00.42]I'm here, come on.
[258:03.01]Kill me, I'm here.
[258:04.39]Come on, kill me.
[258:05.33]I'm here.
[258:09.51]Click, click, click.
[258:20.39]That's pretty good Arnold, right?
[258:22.09]Here I am.
[258:23.41]So, why all the secrecy?
[258:25.40]What do you want from King?
[258:26.66]Streamer throws a tantrum.
[258:29.64]Promise me nothing will happen to him.
[258:31.90]Why do you care so much?
[258:35.20]He's my brother.
[258:36.14]He's not very smart, you see.
[258:39.15]And he's always getting led astray by his no-good friends.
[258:42.07]And now there's some right peculiar characters looking for him.
[258:44.97]Who are they?
[258:47.44]That we are.
[258:47.76]Push her into the mill blades.
[258:49.58]Uh, okay.
[258:49.96]You know what's gonna happen?
[258:51.26]She's gonna get slightly, gently bumped by the windmill.
[258:54.91]That's not gonna even hurt.
[258:57.17]You can put your head down and get hit in the head there and you'll be fine.
[258:59.91]I don't see any shields.
[259:00.91]We got ourselves a fight!
[259:32.27]I don't understand.
[259:32.71]I don't think so.
[259:33.19]No?
[259:33.27]Why not?
[259:49.23]I don't stick my nose into other people's affairs, and I expect the same from them.
[259:54.49]No shield?
[259:55.62]No problem.
[259:57.18]I take good care of people who help me.
[260:00.28]Now, if someone were to tell me where to find Timmy, I might offer that man a job.
[260:05.98]We could use a smart fellow like that at the camp.
[260:12.92]I hear he's hiding in Rat Eye.
[260:15.00]Oh, yeah?
[260:16.42]Where in Rat Eye?
[260:18.26]He seems nice.
[260:19.40]See, we're all Christians.
[260:36.99]Especially if he pays two score Groschen.
[260:39.41]Ha!
[260:40.23]You wouldn't be my cousin by any chance.
[260:42.67]I might be.
[260:43.05]Let's do a DNA test.
[260:43.47]I'll give you two dozen.
[260:44.59]No more.
[260:45.66]Half now, and half when we find him.
[260:48.34]Deal.
[260:49.96]Okay, cool.
[260:51.30]Whoa.
[260:54.70]He's at the Colburn's farm.
[260:56.88]Right back where he started.
[260:59.49]Are you yanking my pistol?
[261:00.85]I don't even know if I am.
[261:01.53]Well, excuse me if I take that with a grain of salt.
[261:04.59]I'll just leave Radan here to keep an eye on you.
[261:07.55]For your own protection, you know.
[261:09.21]Half dozen.
[261:09.81]85.
[261:09.83]Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[261:12.39]If not, come and find us in the Samopesh Tavern when it's all over.
[261:16.94]Or we'll find you.
[261:18.98]Snitch.
[261:33.07]Guy ain't got no shield on.
[261:37.58]What the hell are you doing?
[261:41.00]Double agent.
[261:50.66]Shield.
[261:52.53]Should I go with him?
[261:53.23]What the hell?
[261:59.59]Wait, he is following me around.
[262:01.57]Oh.
[262:05.51]I'm trying to windmill him.
[262:07.18]Let's see if I can windmill him.
[262:10.48]Does it windmill?
[262:11.64]Okay, let's see if I can get him windmilled.
[262:19.18]No, he can't get windmilled.
[262:20.22]Where are they going?
[262:21.55]Kill them?
[262:22.53]You got it.
[262:25.27]Wait until it finds Timmy.
[262:26.73]Yeah, let's go.
[262:27.33]Let's do it.
[262:28.17]I'm going to step in and be a fucking superhero.
[262:31.79]No shields, no problem.
[262:42.32]I'm going to go save Timmy.
[262:43.26]I made a mistake.
[262:44.62]I made a mistake.
[262:45.24]I'm going to go save Timmy.
[262:51.99]I'm willing to admit what I'm wrong.
[263:08.96]See?
[263:09.06]Here they are.
[263:13.73]Alright, who do I get first?
[263:15.05]Who do I get first?
[263:21.87]Wait, important, important.
[263:22.97]I need to be shit-faced.
[263:52.67]Let's do it in alphabetical order.
[263:54.09]Wait, I... Come on, I'm supposed to be good at this!
[264:22.65]Alright, he's hurt.
[264:34.18]Holy shit, you're good.
[264:45.91]I can't kick.
[264:46.39]I'm trying right now.
[264:54.19]This guy's too good.
[264:54.81]This guy's really good, actually.
[265:02.76]Jamie's dead.
[265:03.30]Whoa, what?
[265:12.60]Where did he go?
[265:14.25]Oh, shit.
[265:14.59]That's the guy that was walking this whole time.
[265:16.99]He was walking the whole time.
[265:18.17]That was the bodyguard.
[265:22.47]Oh, God.
[265:23.15]Damn it.
[265:32.87]Where is he?
[265:34.29]How are they already here?
[265:35.17]Fuck it, I'm gonna die.
[265:38.45]And guess where we're gonna start.
[265:41.05]Nah, these guys are too high for me.
[265:44.19]I'm not high enough!
[265:49.91]I'm dead.
[265:51.74]That was like... That was like... Impossible.
[265:55.26]I might be back at the shield guy, because if we are, the stream's over.
[266:14.06]I'm not playing this game ever again.
[266:16.06]It's fucking good.
[266:17.12]This game's really good.
[266:18.72]Kingdom Come Deliverance is a good game that I will never play ever again.
[266:22.31]There it is.
[266:27.47]Here we go!
[266:42.93]shield guy I'm gonna burn shield guy alive I'm gonna beat shield guy first you know what I'm taking my anger out on you you're the catalyst to this whole thing because you're running you're the guy that caused all this problem
[267:08.62]I know I was supposed to say... Am I falling down?
[267:12.18]Of course, it's this guy.
[267:15.04]Shield guy for the next rumble.
[267:27.86]Oh, this started because three guys at the same time.
[267:31.06]Guy runs away.
[267:31.84]And I'm not combat prepared to fight these guys.
[267:37.01]It's this guy's fault.
[267:38.33]It's his fault.
[267:39.89]I can't even, like, go anywhere.
[267:41.03]Time for fucking console commands.
[267:43.89]I just wish I didn't have to have the torch out.
[267:55.37]Why do these guys... Look, okay, let me show you something.
[267:57.27]Ready?
[267:59.13]Why the fuck do these guys not have to have a torch out?
[268:01.92]How does this make any sense?
[268:03.74]Why don't I have to be the one that's lighting the fight?
[268:06.64]It's my job to light the fight for us.
[268:08.70]Oh, hold on, guys.
[268:09.20]We can't see.
[268:09.67]Let me make sure I hold the light for us.
[268:11.13]Doesn't that make no sense?
[268:21.43]They turned that camera all the way up.
[268:28.02]This is running...
[268:32.65]Didn't work.
[268:36.82]I hid in the cave, that worked.
[268:39.16]Nah, that's probably it for tonight.
[268:44.22]That's gonna be it.
[268:46.52]We're way back here because I don't have any... I don't think I have any... I don't even know.
[268:50.76]I don't even know where I am, I'm just fucking lost.
[268:59.95]Q Chloe, load game.
[269:01.09]Let's see where we are.
[269:02.06]My friend Timmy.
[269:05.96]Where is this?
[269:15.39]It hates me.
[269:16.31]It doesn't want me to progress.
[269:20.73]You have to drink a potion to save in this game.
[269:23.01]You know what I mean?
[269:27.44]You have to drink a potion to save.
[269:30.87]What is this, Resident Evil 1?
[269:31.87]Oh!
[269:58.36]Damn it.
[270:01.18]Just like real life.
[270:02.02]Yeah, you gotta drink to save.
[270:06.09]Who's there?
[270:07.97]I just want to get to a town.
[270:10.01]I don't want to be stuck here forever.
[270:11.55]Alright, get me to a road.
[270:21.84]No more giant cliffs.
[270:23.12]Is this a giant cliff?
[270:23.92]No.
[270:27.10]The devs are releasing a patch that allows normal saving.
[270:30.38]Thank God.
[270:31.10]Alright, am I far enough away now where I can just save at a town?
[270:54.23]Alright, I think I'm far enough away.
[270:56.21]Right?
[270:57.05]There's nobody here.
[270:57.61]Go.
[271:06.17]God damn it.
[271:20.76]What now?
[271:24.82]What did I do now?
[271:25.76]Is this because I stole all the guy's stuff?
[271:27.14]Just pay.
[271:27.44]Shooting at people?
[271:28.08]What?
[271:28.20]Yeah, a guy with a shield.
[271:29.30]Fuck this guy.
[271:29.70]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[271:33.38]YES!
[271:33.54]We keep playing now!
[271:53.58]The fate of the whole empire hangs in the balance between King Wenceslas and King Sigismund.
[271:58.95]High politics, you know?
[272:00.97]Not a peep to anyone.
[272:02.35]Well, I thought that is, I had no idea.
[272:07.05]If that's how it is, of course you may go.
[272:16.32]One in like 30 actually worked.
[272:17.98]Alright, give me a second.
[272:24.47]I need a bed.
[272:24.93]I need to- I need to- I need to make up and save or buy a bunch of save potions.
[272:31.61]Give me a bed first.
[272:40.66]I don't think I can- I need to- I'm gonna go like home.
[272:45.66]Just go here and sleep in my bed that saves the fucking game.
[272:50.21]For the love of Christ.
[273:10.48]before I'm gonna get attacked.
[273:16.90]I thought you can't... Is that true?
[273:20.66]I thought everyone was telling me that you had to sleep in your own bed that you own to save the game.
[273:28.74]How is it still nighttime?
[273:29.72]I have no idea.
[273:36.82]Just give me six o'clock in the morning.
[273:51.94]Fucking shield guy man.
[273:54.70]Oh, it's so painful Now I'm gonna go to the master at arms and I'm gonna train because apparently I'm missing moves I
[274:22.20]Can I put this stupid-ass torch down?
[274:30.98]Aye, aye.
[274:32.65]Alright, Bernard, where the hell is he?
[274:33.97]It's like Master at Arms, right here, right?
[274:38.25]Combat Arena.
[274:39.11]Is this where I have to go?
[274:41.05]Can I, like, go here?
[274:59.76]Why do I open the inventory backwards every time?
[275:03.68]Because I just... It's like an OCD thing.
[275:07.75]I, like, have to do it.
[275:10.51]Alright, so where am I going?
[275:11.83]Alright, townsman.
[275:20.19]Can I, like, talk to Bernard?
[275:21.21]I have to go over here.
[275:25.15]Okay.
[275:31.18]Place the marker.
[275:32.06]I don't think he's even here.
[275:35.24]Are there guns in this game?
[275:40.03]No.
[275:40.27]It's medieval, historically accurate.
[275:45.15]History accurate.
[275:50.20]I thought that was Bernard.
[275:51.86]From like over here.
[275:52.58]Look at this.
[275:52.88]It was like a guy with a tiny head.
[275:56.41]Look, see?
[275:57.73]Look at the corner of your eye.
[275:59.57]That's like a guy with a scarf on and a little head sitting down.
[276:02.25]He's in Newhoff?
[276:09.52]Wait, Bernard!
[276:11.40]Thank you.
[276:14.18]I'd be with you.
[276:18.74]Uh... I'd like to learn... This... What?
[276:24.53]Is it... What...
[276:26.91]Why wouldn't they do this?
[276:28.03]Why wouldn't they teach me this already?
[276:29.71]Why do I have to go find him to do this?
[276:30.99]Why wouldn't this be part of the initial tutorial?
[276:33.71]I have to go back later and, like, have him teach me very vital moves?
[276:39.72]Or I get my ass kicked?
[276:41.64]I've trained a bit with the sword, and I think I've got the hang of the basics.
[276:44.82]So you have... Can you teach me something new?
[276:46.96]You're a bit cocky, ain't you?
[276:49.30]Alright then, come and show me what you can do.
[276:51.57]I'm ready.
[276:55.41]Oh my lord.
[277:01.23]Okay.
[277:04.05]Actual real life.
[277:06.53]Attack the teacher.
[277:07.31]Um.
[277:19.44]Are you gonna teach me something?
[277:39.38]Oh, you need to prove yourself.
[277:40.64]Okay.
[277:41.69]I'm just sitting there waiting for him to be like, now what you doing here?
[277:43.75]Have I not proved it yet?
[278:37.30]What's happening I've stabbed him like ten times I can't kill him.
[278:59.86]It's a wooden sword.
[279:00.70]I
[279:10.29]Okay.
[279:11.41]The most important thing.
[279:12.13]Okay.
[279:48.23]Attack.
[279:50.27]Attack me.
[279:53.61]Oh.
[279:54.17]See?
[279:55.47]Hyperion strike in one move.
[279:57.85]There's no defense against this technique if it's executed well.
[280:00.98]He's out of breath.
[280:01.90]Time it right.
[280:03.06]Block right into your opponent's strike and match your movement to his.
[280:06.66]One elegant technique and the fight is won.
[280:08.88]Try it.
[280:10.48]Attack at the same side.
[280:13.99]If you time your block... Wait, wait, wait.
[280:15.69]I need to... Wait a minute.
[280:17.63]If you time your block at the right start of the window of opportunity for a perfect block, you'll execute a... You do a perfect block.
[280:23.67]That's all you need to do.
[280:24.57]It's a perfect block.
[280:28.88]So that there is no addition.
[280:30.00]It's just you have to do a perfect parry.
[280:38.00]That's it.
[280:38.60]You just parry.
[280:39.84]At the perfect time.
[280:45.60]So now that's gonna happen every time.
[280:47.22]You want to really hurt your opponent.
[280:58.93]There's no use just flailing at him and hoping you get lucky.
[281:02.11]Unique technique.
[281:03.27]But using skilled moves is no easy matter.
[281:07.71]Now you know how to do it.
[281:10.83]It's just block at the right time.
[281:12.32]I've been blocking at the right times.
[281:14.88]What the hell?
[281:15.28]Okay, chain strikes.
[281:22.50]Oh, oh, oh, cool.
[281:23.86]Nice.
[281:24.88]It's just a better block.
[281:42.71]Is it stab or slash?
[281:43.65]Does it matter?
[281:44.81]Okay.
[281:44.93]So, bang, bang, bang.
[282:08.60]Okay, hold on.
[282:09.76]Slash, slash, slash.
[282:18.93]So this just wasn't happening before when I was trying to do it because I didn't do this.
[282:22.53]Just do it again.
[282:38.65]Okay.
[282:40.53]So I got... Where's like the go back button?
[282:44.03]Can I get out of this?
[282:44.70]So it's just bang, bang, bang.
[282:49.60]Okay.
[283:07.61]So it's a parry, not a block.
[283:09.47]So right when he starts to swing, you have to stop it, essentially.
[283:14.54]Like that.
[283:17.94]So that makes this whole game so much easier.
[283:22.60]If it actually is an attack, and it knocks him around, it just changes everything.
[283:44.82]Can I just get out of here?
[283:45.68]I understand.
[283:50.08]I'd like to leave the training, please.
[283:58.81]Now go reload the save and fight shield guy.
[284:04.23]I leveled up my sword.
[284:18.91]How do I get out of here?
[284:20.79]Can I fast travel out?
[284:21.77]I have to kill the trainer now.
[284:37.04]I'm hopping the fence.
[284:38.08]Get me the fuck out of here.
[284:41.04]I can't leave.
[284:44.78]I have to let him hit me.
[284:56.92]Go!
[284:59.15]Enough.
[284:59.43]I will do.
[285:01.41]Okay, thank you.
[285:02.13]Bye.
[285:02.47]Alright.
[285:04.65]Seems you're ready for the next lesson.
[285:06.45]Now... God damn it.
[285:07.59]Pay close attention.
[285:09.45]I'll teach you the most important thing.
[285:10.99]It's good to be able to attack...
[285:29.21]I'm going to... This makes... I'm so depressed right now.
[285:35.47]There was no reason why I should have gotten so upset about the game.
[285:39.68]Because I just didn't have moves that I needed.
[285:45.52]If you guys didn't tell me that I had to come back here to learn the most important move in the game, I would never have done it.
[285:54.02]See?
[285:55.36]I parry and strike in one move.
[285:57.82]I'm so depressed that I was that upset.
[285:59.41]I'll attack slowly.
[286:00.37]I had the same thing happen and I didn't know it and I'm just sad.
[286:26.13]I was wondering why I was getting my ass kicked, like, embarrassingly so.
[286:35.41]I gotta go destroy the shield guy.
[286:37.79]But I can't.
[286:39.16]I can't.
[286:39.96]He gets the last laugh forever.
[286:43.14]Because that guy is behind.
[286:44.66]It's back.
[286:45.22]I have to go back and reload the save, but I don't have the moves, so I can't do it.
[286:50.80]I can't do that.
[286:53.19]Reloading the save makes it so I have to lose my new master strikes.
[287:06.96]Gotta go into the woods and find him.
[287:11.76]Forever outpaced by shield guy.
[287:13.76]Yeah.
[287:16.88]did you notice did you notice that I said what did I say I was like this game's great I just don't think I'm gonna play it because I apparently I I I never said anything bad about the game make sure we got that far like it was that was okay didn't say the game was bad said it was great I said it was a great game
[287:52.83]Alright, no horses allowed!
[287:53.85]I'll have to get something to eat.
[287:56.73]I'm starting to get hungry.
[287:57.99]Alright, let's... Let me... Give me a second here.
[288:01.97]Sword.
[288:02.75]Blunt Strike.
[288:04.31]What do I have for a weapon now?
[288:05.32]I'm gonna go get like a huge two-hander.
[288:08.86]This is a combo.
[288:11.82]I already have a couple of these though.
[288:13.66]So are these gonna work now that I've learned them?
[288:18.82]I'm gonna uninstall the game on stream.
[288:22.84]Yeah, but that... Look, just because I said I'm going to uninstall the game on stream does not mean the game is not a good, like, decent game.
[288:30.55]That just means I'm going to uninstall the game on stream.
[288:35.41]So these are for... This is for longsword.
[288:37.49]This is only for shortsword.
[288:39.71]Longsword.
[288:42.93]I have a longsword right now.
[288:45.81]Because I was able to do this.
[288:48.88]So I can do this one too.
[288:52.67]Short sword.
[288:53.27]Okay, long sword.
[288:53.93]Here we go.
[288:55.39]Long sword.
[288:58.68]Short sword.
[288:59.26]Long sword.
[288:59.78]Okay, long.
[289:00.48]Let's do this one.
[289:01.22]This one's just down and then just nothing.
[289:02.78]Just middle, middle.
[289:09.60]I have a short sword.
[289:10.40]I probably do.
[289:11.16]I have skills to put into.
[289:14.39]So we're... I'm probably going to stream... I'll probably stream this game tomorrow, too.
[289:25.51]Just kind of get it out of our system.
[289:27.93]And like that, I'll install it on stream.
[289:34.18]Your horse can carry more, but it's slower.
[289:36.40]Your horse is faster, but carries less weight.
[289:39.54]That's fine.
[289:41.34]I like that one.
[289:44.87]Combat stats.
[289:46.03]That's all I can do.
[289:54.71]Yeah, we'll do tomorrow, too.
[289:57.11]And then probably on Thursday, we're probably going to go back to PlayStation 1 on Thursday.
[290:07.87]So, we'll do some more PS1 nonsense on Thursday.
[290:11.49]Maybe into Friday, too.
[290:14.87]We still got a lot of monsters to breed in Monster Rancher.
[290:24.93]So let me get the game saved.
[290:28.71]And then we'll start tomorrow.
[290:30.47]I'm probably going to start really early tomorrow.
[290:36.02]So I'm probably going to... This is the end of the stream here.
[290:41.60]I am enjoying this game.
[290:43.10]Going to uninstall it on stream.
[290:46.24]I'm never playing the game ever again, right?
[290:47.90]Like I said.
[290:48.40]So I'll see you tomorrow.
[290:51.56]Tomorrow, probably early.
[290:52.60]During the...
[290:55.47]Hours of, I'm going to say, we're going to do an EU stream tomorrow.
[291:02.46]So probably, let's see.
[291:04.36]Let me see what time it is.
[291:09.32]Probably like, I want to see maybe like 11 to 12 PM Eastern.
[291:17.38]That sounds about right.
[291:22.83]Glad you're liking the game.
[291:23.59]I haven't played it myself, but I appreciate what it does.
[291:26.12]Yeah, really, the only complaints I have is... I do kind of wish, like, if you're talking about, like, game-requiring combat abilities, like, I feel like they should really tell you, like, not just be like, oh, by the way, come back and see me sometime.
[291:41.99]No, like, if, like, that, if those, like, two things that I just learned are, like, required to play the game, I feel like I wish I knew that they were actually required.
[291:52.65]Because we did the sword training and he just kind of was like, yeah, come back.
[291:55.24]You should come back to me someday.
[291:58.06]So, I mean, that's really the only complaint I have about that.
[292:00.56]Because there was no, I just didn't, I just thought I was fucking terrible.
[292:05.20]I just thought like, I thought like I just would never complete the game.
[292:10.28]But yeah, that's going to be like 12 p.m.
[292:13.13]11 a.m.
[292:13.69]or 12, probably, we'll probably start around 12 p.m.
[292:16.53]You are, you are terrible.
[292:18.51]How dare you?
[292:21.15]You're gonna have a bad time if you don't... Streamer sidesteps.
[292:26.24]No, I... Look, I have trouble learning shit.
[292:29.66]I have, like, OCD.
[292:30.42]I have ADHD.
[292:31.68]But... I don't know, man.
[292:33.12]Something about that... That's... Come on.
[292:36.00]Our required game ability.
[292:39.16]Like, it should... That should be something that you learn, like, at the same time.
[292:42.50]When you're doing the sword training, it should be like, by the way, make... This is the most important move, but you can't learn it yet until you come back.
[292:51.32]A-D-D-O-C-H-D-E-B.
[292:53.70]Yeah.
[292:55.18]But I'm still having fun.
[292:57.02]It's a great game so far.
[292:59.46]It's very much not what I expected.
[293:03.23]But it doesn't mean it's bad.
[293:06.65]Hope you enjoyed it.
[293:07.23]Hope you had fun.
[293:09.59]Do I really have ADHD?
[293:11.09]Oh my god, yeah.
[293:12.11]It's terrible.
[293:13.39]I've had it my whole life.
[293:16.79]But with that, hey, let's do the end.
[293:23.26]Welcome to the end of the stream.
[293:24.08]Thanks for sticking around.

[296:02.02]That's a good question.
[296:05.34]But, thank you so much, everybody.
[296:08.98]All the subs.
[296:09.68]Let's get to the bits now.
[296:13.96]I missed C.L.
[296:14.60]Hammer.
[296:15.10]What?
[296:15.32]I did?
[296:17.18]How?
[296:17.74]How did I miss it?
[296:18.42]Let's call him.
[296:21.64]C.L.
[296:21.96]Hammer.
[296:22.98]Thank you for the sub.
[296:24.12]I appreciate it.
[296:25.99]C.L.
[296:26.81]Hammer.
[296:30.05]You didn't say my name.
[296:31.25]People's what?
[296:32.81]What happened?
[296:33.57]I'm apologizing.
[296:34.47]You got me an apology.
[296:35.43]I'm apologizing.
[296:39.95]I'm sorry.
[296:44.61]We did it.
[296:46.31]Thanks, guys.
[296:49.39]And now let's get to the bits.
[296:51.53]The bits for tonight.
[296:55.39]Start off with StixRenegade.
[296:56.49]Thank you for the $1, dude.
[296:58.14]Please read this correctly this time.
[296:59.76]Soy un streamer bajito.
[297:04.64]I think I just said I'm a shitty streamer or something.
[297:07.08]But thank you.
[297:07.89]No, wait, that wasn't even Styx.
[297:08.79]That was Sona Genova that said that.
[297:09.99]Thanks for the $1, Sona Genova.
[297:11.99]Styx said... Another fun fact.
[297:15.81]The first rapper to chart in the US was Debbie Harry.
[297:20.42]The singer of the band Blondie with the song Rapture.
[297:23.70]Interesting.
[297:25.35]Not dead mod, Kyle.
[297:26.15]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[297:27.39]Random fact, Guinness Book of Records holds the record for being the book most often stolen from public libraries.
[297:31.27]Why would you have that in the public library anyways?
[297:33.43]That's only for old books that nobody reads and that you only read in, like, high school.
[297:37.03]I swear to God, every book in a public library had better be The Great Gatsby, Call the Wild, or, like, To Kill a Mockingbird.
[297:46.18]That's literally every single book.
[297:48.00]That's all they have.
[297:48.56]There's three different sections with those books.
[297:51.04]There's, like, 400 of the same book.
[297:55.68]But thank you, uh, Hytra725 for the $1.
[297:57.72]Hey, Jerma, did you know that the girls store pee in their inner balls?
[298:03.64]Yes, I did.
[298:04.54]I did know that.
[298:08.20]I do know that.
[298:08.96]I mean, that's just what it is.
[298:12.74]Thank you, StormerShadow again from earlier.
[298:14.57]You gave $50 earlier.
[298:15.63]Thanks a lot, man.
[298:17.87]Adrian.
[298:19.17]Adrian's Meow, thanks for the $1.
[298:20.73]Hey, Jerma, it's actually my birthday today and I'm enjoying your stream.
[298:23.23]Happy birthday, Adrian.
[298:25.35]Have a wonderful birthday.
[298:27.35]It's still, it's 1154 p.m.
[298:29.33]Eastern Time.
[298:29.95]I got it.
[298:30.62]It's still your birthday, unless you live somewhere that's a later time zone, in which case... Ah, sorry.
[298:37.92]Missed it.
[298:40.00]Thank you, HighlordNameless, for the $1 minus 40 cents.
[298:43.76]Thank you, BigWell.
[298:45.70]JervisBoyfriend, thanks for the two bucks.
[298:47.02]Do a Larry David Freakout impression.
[298:50.72]I gotta be, I can't do it on the spot.
[298:55.09]Go watch the facade video, I do it there.
[298:57.91]But thank you for the $2, dude.
[298:58.81]Appreciate it.
[299:00.43]Demilkmaster, thanks for the $1.
[299:01.79]Play Garfield Cart.
[299:02.73]This is the third message he's said about this, by the way.
[299:05.26]Uh, no.
[299:06.02]Thank you, though.
[299:06.44]Appreciate it.
[299:07.36]SmokewiseGanja, thanks for the $10.
[299:09.32]He said this earlier, but I appreciate it.
[299:10.96]Thanks for the $10, dude.
[299:13.14]NotDeadModKyle, again, thanks for the quarter.
[299:15.18]Random fact, volcanoes can sometimes shoot out lightning.
[299:18.66]It is generated within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano.
[299:21.81]It's a process called charge separation.
[299:26.15]That's pretty cool.
[299:29.15]Meow, NYX, thanks for the one dollar.
[299:31.71]They just say, cheer, thank you.
[299:34.05]SmokewiseGanja, again, thanks for the five bucks.
[299:35.59]Let's talk about the bits.
[299:36.67]How's this sound?
[299:39.31]What do you mean?
[299:41.55]You sound pretty good.
[299:42.43]Thanks for the five bucks, SmokewiseGanja.
[299:45.93]Parsnips, thanks for the one dollar.
[299:47.15]How much for you to cook and eat a half done on stream?
[299:49.51]I will pay royally.
[299:52.25]No, I'm not gonna eat raw hamburger meat.
[299:54.27]You can get, like, sick that way.
[299:56.41]Thank you, though, dude.
[300:00.30]No.
[300:00.50]I've been a good boy... that just dives into a mental breakdown when he can't figure out how to do basic game mechanics.
[300:10.42]Uh, that's pretty much what you've got.
[300:11.78]Actually, hold on a minute.
[300:14.05]Only one meltdown today, it's been five hours.
[300:16.15]Only one, we were very, very cautiously, we were playing, we were having fun.
[300:19.45]One meltdown in a game like this?
[300:20.75]That's pretty, that's pretty good.
[300:22.55]Five hours?
[300:23.11]That's one meltdown per five hours.
[300:25.45]I had a meltdown two days ago.
[300:27.71]That was about a five hour stream.
[300:29.65]Didn't have, we only got two meltdowns in about 15 or 16 hours of streaming.
[300:34.65]I mean... Can I at least get credit for that?
[300:39.09]I should.
[300:44.84]0.2 meltdowns an hour.
[300:45.90]The whole stream... Oh, yeah, okay.
[300:53.79]Hold on a second.
[300:55.83]Two streams ago, I will agree with you.
[300:57.51]Yes, that whole stream was a meltdown.
[301:02.35]I will never live it down but it's there forever we only had like seven we had like 21 minutes of meltdown tonight let's think about it so 16 or 17 hours in the game on stream one hour of full meltdown two days ago 25 30 minutes of meltdown tonight so that's an hour and 30 minute meltdown total over 16 or 17 hours what's the percentage there
[301:27.69]That's like a 15%... That's a 15%-20% meltdown ratio there.
[301:32.38]It's okay.
[301:35.96]I'm alright with that.
[301:36.88]I would like to drop that percentage to about 6.
[301:39.00]Or like 8% under 10.
[301:46.49]Thanks for not being one of those streamers that spams Fortnite.
[301:50.71]I can't... I don't play Battle Royale.
[301:52.19]I just can't do it.
[301:56.61]Those numbers wouldn't fly in a nuclear power plant.
[301:58.57]Well, that's because I'm not a power plant.
[302:00.47]I'm a guy.
[302:01.01]Well, those numbers wouldn't fly in a nuclear power plant, guy sitting at a computer.
[302:12.10]No, I don't play Battle Royale.
[302:16.04]I don't play, like, MOBA.
[302:18.86]I don't really play... I don't play really any of the top five kind of games on Twitch.
[302:23.76]This one's kind of an exception because it's a new, fun, interesting, open-world game with a lot of crazy shit in it, so... I don't typically play those games, and it's just because... Nah.
[302:40.62]I lose my... I lose interest really quickly.
[302:45.26]And there's only been really a handful of games in my whole life that have held my attention for more than a few months.
[302:53.19]I would say if you held my attention for more than six months, then that game is... I have to put it on my favorite games ever list, right?
[302:59.97]I mean, TF2.
[303:01.25]I played that game for like seven years.
[303:03.57]Straight.
[303:04.55]Off and on, maybe I took a good break here and there.
[303:07.20]Diablo II.
[303:07.68]Um...
[303:12.33]I mean, I can't... I'm trying to think of, like, other... Maybe, like, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, like, that I, like, literally played for months.
[303:22.75]Speaking of Dark Souls, we are gonna play that when it releases on the, um... The newer consoles when they do the remaster.
[303:30.58]Looking forward to that.
[303:35.72]What character on D2?
[303:36.74]All of them.
[303:37.30]Every single one.
[303:38.36]Multiple times.
[303:39.02]Hundreds of times, potentially.
[303:41.83]I've gotten every single class in Diablo II from like 1 to at least 90 or at least 85.
[303:49.60]At least two or three dozen times.
[303:53.54]I love that game.
[303:55.72]Haven't played in a long time though.
[303:58.10]Highest level character I ever had I think was 95 or 96.
[303:59.88]It was a 95 Amazon Boson.
[304:06.99]This guy's a real nerd.
[304:07.97]Yeah, I guess I am.
[304:10.72]Anyways, uh, thank you, uh, AdmirableKittyDong, thanks for the $1.
[304:13.95]Sup, Jeremy, thanks for the laughs.
[304:14.95]Been watching since before high school.
[304:17.04]And now I'm on my way to animation school.
[304:19.76]been a large part of keeping me from taking my own life.
[304:23.02]So I'd like to give more, but I'm saving my shekels to pay off the enormous debt from school.
[304:29.12]Also, think about forming a more regular hunting party.
[304:32.34]Monster Hunter is one of those series that never gets old.
[304:34.65]No matter how much you grind the same monsters and playing with friends only makes it that much better.
[304:39.09]Well, admirable thank you for the $10.
[304:41.39]I'm
[304:46.68]I'm sorry that you feel that way sometimes But if I can be any part to help Please use the resources that are available if that is a serious Comment you're talking about there There's lots of places to go for help.
[305:05.25]I hope you utilize them if that's true and Just keep going man But to answer your Monster Hunter
[305:17.61]Uh, Monster Hunter, I've been playing it a lot off stream.
[305:20.71]Me and Etalyx have been playing it pretty much every... single... I'd say like every single like week we do like at least like four or five hours in Monster Hunter.
[305:32.54]Yeah, nobody should ever have to feel that way, man.
[305:37.10]And it's hard to, it's hard to like imagine and like put myself in your shoes.
[305:42.98]Or anybody's shoes.
[305:45.65]But you really don't want to be thinking like that.
[305:49.39]The best thing you can do is try to talk to somebody.
[305:50.95]Because nobody deserves to feel like that.
[305:57.15]At all.
[306:00.83]But, yeah, I think we're nearing completion of the storyline in Monster Hunter.
[306:07.41]It's a great game.
[306:08.09]The game's awesome.
[306:08.99]I've been just enjoying it off stream.
[306:11.93]But thanks a lot, man.
[306:12.52]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[306:13.10]Appreciate it.
[306:15.38]Sergeant Chicken, many thanks for the one dollar.
[306:16.76]There's a YouTube link here, but... I guess I'll click it.
[306:23.93]Let's see what it is.
[306:26.61]Oh, no, no, no.
[306:27.29]I am clicking off this.
[306:28.01]That is a L.A.
[306:28.95]Noire video.
[306:29.65]I don't want to see a damn thing about that game.
[306:33.03]See, here's the thing.
[306:34.86]A lot of people...
[306:37.41]I get a lot of shit for not knowing what the fuck I'm doing in video games a lot of times.
[306:41.39]But I'm gonna give you my only, like, defense here is I... I'm extraordinarily adamant about going into every game totally blind and not reading anything, not, like, learning anything.
[306:55.58]I want to just absorb into it completely because I don't want to see anything that might be funny.
[306:59.94]I don't want to know how to do something beforehand because then it's not a genuine thing.
[307:06.56]And that could be a problem.
[307:09.06]Me not even thinking to read a second of, like, some of these complicated games, it hurts a lot sometimes, because I get lost completely.
[307:18.07]But I will not stop doing it, because I have, I don't want to give, like, fake reactions, or if I see something really funny, like, that's off stream, and I'm like, oh, I'm gonna, like, do that on stream.
[307:29.80]I don't want to, let's pretend.
[307:34.33]You left-wing leaning parasite.
[307:37.93]You ex- what?
[307:41.64]What the fuck are you talking about?
[307:46.60]You don't know how- you don't know where I am politically.
[307:49.58]You guys do know where I am politically.
[307:53.34]You guys already know where I am politically.
[307:55.76]And you can- and I'm not gonna go over it again.
[307:57.57]You're gonna have to go find it if you really want to know.
[308:01.11]Oh, that's an LA-
[308:10.03]I thought I was getting, like, attacked.
[308:14.30]Like, you fucking left-leaning parasite.
[308:17.02]I'm just like, holy shit, man.
[308:18.26]What are you talking?
[308:19.96]What?
[308:22.30]Oh, my God.
[308:23.26]Wow, that's funny.
[308:27.08]I was about to, like, seriously be like, whoa, come on, man.
[308:29.40]Like, what's up with that?
[308:35.60]He was a sub, too.
[308:36.56]Yeah, I'm just like, whoa.
[308:39.27]That guy was angry.
[308:42.28]Anyways, thank you to... I think I missed one or two back here.
[308:45.00]Let's make sure I didn't.
[308:48.30]Uh-huh.
[308:51.39]There's that.
[308:54.25]Thank you, WitchFever, for the $1.
[308:56.37]You're so inspiring.
[308:57.77]You grew from a tiny baby making goofy egg videos and dog videos, and you evolved into such a successful streamer.
[309:04.35]It's really reassuring knowing that you can make a lot of money playing games without being any good at them.
[309:11.11]Beat Flameworker first try.
[309:12.72]Blind in Demon's Souls.
[309:15.22]How many times did it take you?
[309:16.50]I mean,
[309:28.78]Just kidding.
[309:30.30]Zero tries.
[309:37.68]But I can't beat a fucking shield guy.
[309:40.88]That's the problem.
[309:41.80]Look, I'm gonna give you guys a real insight into my life, into my psyche.
[309:47.19]It infuriates me.
[309:49.05]It infuriates me.
[309:51.15]That I can beat what is arguably considered...
[309:55.29]One of the most difficult encounters in the entire series of the Souls series, right?
[310:01.20]The whole series.
[310:02.82]I could do that first fucking try.
[310:05.14]It's like a 12 minute fight that requires perfect, PERFECT precision.
[310:11.14]And I did it blind first try.
[310:13.52]But then I can't fucking figure out how to get off a horse in this game.
[310:18.46]It's infuriating.
[310:23.24]How am I still streaming?
[310:24.33]I don't know.
[310:28.24]On stream, too.
[310:33.60]What about Champion Gundyr, for instance, right?
[310:35.70]I beat that guy first try.
[310:36.58]He's considered one of the hardest bosses in that whole game.
[310:39.18]But I can literally not figure out how to block somebody that's swinging at me in this game.
[310:49.87]Not all games are the same.
[310:50.75]But yeah, I get so lost upstairs sometimes.
[310:57.61]Hey, it's that guy's birthday.
[310:58.55]Happy birthday, man.
[311:03.82]No, no, not the first Gundyr.
[311:09.32]Hey, come on.
[311:10.16]I beat the last boss of Dark Souls 3.
[311:11.68]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[311:12.60]Because this is just a fucking meme at this point.
[311:14.31]This is just like a joke at this point.
[311:16.23]But the point still stands.
[311:28.60]Some horses are smarter than people.
[311:31.33]Yeah, not the first guy.
[311:32.65]I'm talking about the other guy.
[311:40.38]Jeremy's doing something that's not a joke.
[311:41.92]I mean, this is what we do after the stream.
[311:45.29]We have, like, Jerma985, welcome to the Twitch show!
[311:49.47]Here we are, checking out a game!
[311:50.97]And, like, I hold my composure, and I'm, like, having fun, and talking, and comments, and jokes, except... That's not even true, I, like, fucking freak out and lose my patience.
[311:58.52]And then we go, after the stream, it's like the real talk.
[312:01.14]We sit here and we hang out for, like, 10, 20, 30 minutes, and we do some bits, we talk...
[312:04.87]This is the after show.
[312:06.47]We're like, I take the wig off, you know what I mean?
[312:08.88]Like, I sit down, the wig comes off, and, like, the makeup gets rubbed off, and I'm in the mirror, like, doing my face wash, and we're talking.
[312:15.40]10 to 3, yeah, it's like an hour.
[312:25.59]No, I'm just kidding, but... Thank you.
[312:30.29]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[312:32.51]Thank you to Corvid Moon for the $5.
[312:35.73]Hope those Latin reading lessons paid off.
[312:38.31]I have a message for you.
[312:39.19]Jeremy est non minum saint sum brevis.
[312:44.95]Okay.
[312:48.62]Whatever that was.
[312:50.33]Not Dead Mod Kyle again, you're gonna get a 25 cent sneeze here.
[312:52.89]Uh, fun fact, the term mad as a hatter came about as hat makers used to use Mercury, which is toxic, and prolonged usage can cause nerve damage.
[313:02.98]Driving hat makers to madness is also why the sickness, uh, Einstein is called mad hatter, uh, disease.
[313:09.98]Okay.
[313:11.36]I didn't sneeze.
[313:11.96]Uh, asparagus pants, thanks for the three bucks.
[313:15.67]Much love, Jerry boy.
[313:16.39]Thanks for making days less sucky.
[313:17.59]Thanks, dude.
[313:19.28]Thank you, Son of Jenova, for the $1.
[313:20.54]Please turn on your face cam and dab.
[313:22.22]Ah, nope.
[313:23.02]Thank you.
[313:23.44]Appreciate the $1.
[313:24.39]Thank you, Gerstner.
[313:27.37]Gerstner boy.
[313:28.13]Thanks for the $5.
[313:28.91]Jeremy.
[313:30.17]It's Nicholas from the birthday shoutout.
[313:31.65]Just wanted to say thank you so much, despite it being late.
[313:34.07]Thanks for the laughs after all these years.
[313:37.09]I look forward to many more.
[313:38.76]Hey, Gerstner.
[313:40.50]Happy birthday again, even though we're already... Happy birthday, Nick.
[313:45.16]Happy birthday.
[313:45.66]I hope you turned that age...
[313:51.66]But welcome.
[313:54.68]Thank you.
[314:00.46]You know, like I... We talked about this already.
[314:04.84]How do you guys know what I do, like, off stream?
[314:07.56]I'm a pretty private person, right?
[314:08.82]Like, I don't...
[314:10.63]When the stream's not on and there's no, like, video or anything, like, I make, like, a tweet, like, once a month or something.
[314:15.54]Like, how do you know what I'm doing on my times when I'm not streaming?
[314:19.90]I could be working on a fucking vaccine.
[314:21.87]Mm-hmm.
[314:23.69]But, like, streamer can't get off a horse.
[314:26.01]Guy sucks at video games, but he's creating a vaccine.
[314:30.17]Like, it's gonna cure every disease.
[314:33.04]It's fucking bright blue too.
[314:35.28]I told them when we first started doing research.
[314:37.78]I was like, bright blue.
[314:39.68]It better be.
[314:40.18]It has to be bright blue.
[314:42.76]And everyone looked at me like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?
[314:44.87]I almost slapped the guy that said that first.
[314:50.01]He was like, why would we do that?
[314:51.27]I was like, don't you?
[314:52.77]And then I got my composure because I took the wig off and I got the makeup off and I got my composure.
[315:01.14]Thank you, KingBot, for the 50 cents.
[315:02.66]Apotheon is one of my favorite games, and I just found out you did voice work for it.
[315:06.50]Would I ever stream it?
[315:08.38]I made a video on it a long time ago.
[315:11.30]It was a lot of fun to do that.
[315:13.39]It's a pretty interesting game.
[315:14.31]It's a fun game, too.
[315:17.97]But thank you, KingBot.
[315:18.81]Appreciate it.
[315:19.79]RoboChicken, thanks for the $1.
[315:21.31]I love you, JermaDadE.
[315:23.63]Thanks, RoboChicken.
[315:24.35]Appreciate the $1.
[315:25.23]Fred Flintstone, thanks for the $1.
[315:26.54]Listen to me, son.
[315:27.10]Destroy him.
[315:29.10]Pulling back the pallbearer.
[315:31.66]Devlon, 2 million.
[315:32.58]Thanks for the $2.10.
[315:34.86]What's the longest time you've gone without a shower?
[315:36.96]Mine's three weeks.
[315:37.84]And who said chivalry was dead?
[315:41.38]Longest time I've gone without a shower is probably two or three days.
[315:44.08]I can't do it.
[315:45.34]I have to wash my hair every day.
[315:47.34]If I don't wash my hair for a full day, I lose my mind.
[315:51.82]Thanks, 2 million.
[315:54.45]Thank you Chojiboy for the $2.45.
[315:57.05]The final boss has two shields, one on each arm.
[315:59.95]It's okay, because I learned the necessary move to continue playing the video game.
[316:05.70]He'll be easy enough.
[316:08.18]Burboyo, thanks for the 50 cents.
[316:09.86]Thanks for the $1 total.
[316:11.31]Appreciate it.
[316:11.89]Maisykit, thanks for the $1.
[316:14.49]Heyo, I didn't make it until the end.
[316:15.81]How did today's stream go?
[316:16.87]Went really well.
[316:19.00]Up until I got stopped by a guy with a shield for about 30 to 40 minutes, and then I ended the stream in rage.
[316:27.20]That's not... Well, maybe we've gone for more than five hours at that point.
[316:30.91]The first four and a half hours of that stream was really, really good.
[316:33.65]It was fun.
[316:35.07]And then I got stuck for like 30 minutes.
[316:38.27]And then the last 40 minutes, what we're doing now, it's going great.
[316:42.09]Game's fun.
[316:42.79]Check it out.
[316:46.32]Crunchy Jester, thanks for the $1.
[316:47.63]I'm trying to think of something funny, but I just can't.
[316:49.55]So spam some lulls in the chat for me.
[316:52.47]See if you get it.
[316:53.91]Dingus Town, thanks for the $15.
[316:54.85]$15.
[316:54.97]Thanks for the distraction.
[316:58.24]Through a tough time.
[316:58.98]Love you.
[317:00.72]Thank you, Dingus.
[317:01.30]Hopefully what you're going through is quickly resolved.
[317:06.26]Take care.
[317:06.66]Much love to you.
[317:08.34]Thank you, Dingus Town, for the $15.
[317:12.06]Uh, not that many more here.
[317:13.27]Jerma's boyfriend, thanks for the dollar.
[317:14.61]Five.
[317:15.05]Everybody's talking about climate change, right?
[317:16.73]Pretty interesting stuff, right?
[317:17.77]Speaking of climate change, uh, when is Jeremy... I don't say that name, okay?
[317:23.63]Gonna start thinking about an underwear change, am I right?
[317:26.91]I have the same two pairs of underwear.
[317:28.59]Uh, thank you, Devlon2Million for the one dollar.
[317:31.97]What's your favorite pastry?
[317:32.95]I love cinnamon buns.
[317:34.09]Because I imagine I'm eating your ass whenever I have one.
[317:36.09]That's great.
[317:38.31]That's good.
[317:39.34]Uh...
[317:41.26]Favorite pastry, to answer your actual question, that baited me into a joke.
[317:46.36]Um... I, uh... My favorite pastry is probably, like, a cheese, uh, Danish.
[317:55.98]That's probably it.
[317:57.10]Thank you, e-word, twert, e-word, twert!
[317:59.32]For the two bucks.
[318:00.18]What music do you like that's not gorillas?
[318:03.65]Good night.
[318:04.09]Well, thank you for the two bucks, e-word, twert, e-word, twert.
[318:07.07]Thanks a bunch.
[318:08.81]Um...
[318:12.76]I don't really listen to that much music.
[318:16.06]Besides, since I've gotten a little older, I don't really put on the radio anymore.
[318:20.31]I turn the radio on.
[318:21.85]Like, you know the South Park joke where Stan turns the radio on?
[318:24.43]It's just like diarrhea sounds.
[318:26.63]That's kind of how I am now.
[318:27.79]I don't even care.
[318:29.21]All the top charting music right now I think is just awful.
[318:32.34]I can't even listen to it for more than 30 seconds.
[318:37.12]But I think if I were to actually answer that question...
[318:43.36]Uh... I don't know.
[318:46.86]I really don't know.
[318:47.80]I wish I could answer it.
[318:55.13]I'm sitting here truly just biting my lip trying to think of something besides, like, the gorillas.
[319:01.49]I'm gonna throw a name out here.
[319:03.92]Beck.
[319:07.32]I... He's pretty good.
[319:09.64]Uh...
[319:13.15]I don't, I haven't, uh, Iron Maiden?
[319:18.07]Uh, let me think.
[319:25.01]Maybe, um, I don't know.
[319:32.57]There you go.
[319:34.13]Beck, Iron Maiden, and the Gorillaz are like three bands that I would not object to you putting on.
[319:38.23]Oh, and probably like a WWF entrance music album.
[319:41.33]I would listen to the fuck out of that all day.
[319:43.81]You got like the Rocks theme song, Stone Colds theme song, Ken Shamrock.
[319:47.74]Put that on over anything on the top ten right now.
[319:52.08]Thanking Jerma's boyfriend for the $1.
[319:55.04]Everybody's talking about climate change.
[319:56.36]Oh, I got this one already.
[319:57.22]Thank you, my boyfriend.
[319:58.54]I appreciate it.
[320:00.19]Devlon?
[320:01.35]Why are these popping up again?
[320:02.74]That's weird.
[320:04.38]Yeah, okay, here we are.
[320:06.04]C. Casey, thanks for the 40 cents.
[320:07.52]Hey, Jerma, just want to thank you for the money laughs.
[320:09.48]Thank you for the money laughs.
[320:11.20]Many laughs over the past few years.
[320:12.44]You always bring a smile to my face, even in my worst days.
[320:15.38]Thank you, Casey.
[320:16.81]Thank you for the 40 cents.
[320:19.51]Appreciate it.
[320:20.77]I'm glad I can do that for you.
[320:22.35]Because you do it for me.
[320:24.41]Only you.
[320:24.83]Thank you.
[320:26.86]Uh, Gimli Sack, thanks for the five bucks.
[320:28.69]What is your honest opinion on Bernie running in 2020?
[320:31.19]Don't do it, Bernie.
[320:35.67]You're gonna be like 80.
[320:36.69]He's gonna be like 85.
[320:38.79]Just don't, don't even, don't do it.
[320:42.03]Bernie's gonna like take the fucking stand and put his hand in the air and read the, I, yes, I will be the president.
[320:47.91]And he's gonna like die in a year.
[320:57.73]We need new fresh blood.
[321:02.47]I don't care what party you are.
[321:04.61]Sound policy.
[321:08.65]You're with it, both socially and economically.
[321:14.00]But that person doesn't exist.
[321:17.96]That's a horrible thing to say.
[321:19.56]How old is Bernie Sanders?
[321:23.02]How old is he?
[321:29.37]He's 76 years old.
[321:31.83]That means he's going to be 78 in 2020.
[321:36.07]Bernie's not even going to be able to remember his name in like three years.
[321:42.61]He's going to be 80.
[321:43.25]They're going to be changing his diapers in that office.
[321:53.12]VPs exist for a reason.
[321:54.60]Yeah, but I mean, come on.
[322:01.99]Do I think like... No, we don't talk about politics.
[322:07.79]He's almost my age.
[322:11.16]We're getting off this topic.
[322:15.18]No, no, no.
[322:15.78]We're not talking about Bernie Sanders.
[322:17.38]I don't want to talk about Bernie.
[322:21.56]I don't want to talk about Trump.
[322:24.62]I don't want to talk about the John Kasich Hickenlooper Unity ticket in 2020.
[322:27.57]I mean, come on.
[322:28.19]I don't want to talk about that one.
[322:39.67]Bread.
[322:46.16]We don't talk about politics.
[322:47.58]How, hee-haw, Bernie Oldman can't remember his name.
[322:54.15]No, politics, you can't talk about politics.
[322:57.89]Look, you have to be informed enough.
[323:02.24]At least from me, in my opinion.
[323:04.87]I have a lot of opinions, right?
[323:06.57]But I don't want to tell you something like, well, you see, the thing is, if you vote for this guy, you know, he's supporting bill number 495 that passed and it took food away from dogs.
[323:19.06]It's just like, I'm not informed enough to fight that person.
[323:23.96]And I don't want to, like, tell you how to change, I don't want to change your opinion you have because I might not even be informed enough to change it for you.
[323:34.78]Call Bernie, he's crying.
[323:40.86]I have the things that I believe, right?
[323:42.76]And if they... If they coincide with what somebody else is saying, then maybe, okay, like... Who is this person?
[323:53.00]We got these two teams.
[323:55.56]Constantly fighting.
[323:59.52]Everybody's fighting.
[324:03.34]We gotta bring them all together.
[324:08.70]Bill 495 actually helps dogs.
[324:17.23]Uh-oh, politics.
[324:18.47]Isn't it past your bedtime?
[324:24.49]Redo the country.
[324:25.55]No.
[324:27.32]I don't disrespect anybody's political beliefs, unless you're a goddamn Republican!
[324:32.87]No, I'm kidding.
[324:33.31]That's a joke.
[324:34.37]Oh, you parasitic liberals!
[324:37.39]Someone's gonna use those clips, and I hope they don't use them.
[324:43.80]I really hope they don't use those.
[324:46.12]Why did I just do that?
[324:47.62]That was a fucking mistake.
[324:50.78]I just offended both sides by doing that.
[324:53.50]And it was a joke.
[324:54.20]It was just a fucking... I was talking about the times.
[324:57.12]Aye, aye, aye.
[324:58.08]Okay, anyways.
[325:02.96]I just pissed off everybody in the United States.
[325:06.42]In five seconds.
[325:13.23]Dingus Talent, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[325:16.53]Again.
[325:16.73]Appreciate it.
[325:22.35]Uh, wait, why is this doing this to me?
[325:24.65]It keeps showing new old ones.
[325:27.33]Topac, thanks for the 20 bucks, Topac.
[325:28.99]Here you go for the game that sucks.
[325:31.49]I've changed my opinion since two streams ago.
[325:34.95]Game doesn't suck.
[325:37.15]Game is way too big for its own good, has way too much going on for its own good, and is not polished at all.
[325:47.64]There's a lot here, the game is good, but the scope, I think, may have been a little too much for the studio.
[325:56.21]And it's very clear based on copious amounts of game-ruining bugs.
[326:01.13]Like the guy with the shield.
[326:02.81]I mean, the fucking biggest bug of all, games riddled with bugs.
[326:05.95]The guy with the shield, I couldn't hit him at all.
[326:07.55]It was a crazy bug.
[326:08.99]Games are full of bugs.
[326:11.98]Um...
[326:13.62]No, it's a good game.
[326:15.84]I don't think this game is going to change the world, but it's definitely fun enough, and it's different enough than the things that you're used to.
[326:23.71]It's worth a look.
[326:30.07]Remember when you couldn't walk through the door?
[326:35.37]Yeah, but I mean, that's whatever.
[326:37.83]It's alright.
[326:41.30]Uh... Coconut Lips.
[326:43.02]Thank you for the one dollar.
[326:43.82]Without getting into politics, what's your favorite flavor of Dorito?
[326:47.94]Oh, great.
[326:50.46]You know what?
[326:51.64]Unfortunately, it's the red one.
[326:55.22]I'm a Dorito Republican.
[326:58.90]There's the Cool Ranch.
[327:00.32]It's this blue Cool Ranch red nacho cheese.
[327:04.67]Unfortunately, I'm a Dorito Republican.
[327:09.81]Sorry, but... Controversy.
[327:23.64]Everyone's just like, oh my god.
[327:27.10]Cool Ranch.
[327:29.90]Lay's versus Doritos.
[327:31.80]Doritos are awful.
[327:32.62]I didn't say I wanted to choose Doritos.
[327:36.33]The question that I was just given was, what's your favorite flavor of Dorito?
[327:42.09]Not, sir, what's your favorite chip?
[327:46.59]Because it's not Doritos.
[327:49.52]It's Munchos.
[327:51.74]And that bag is red, too.
[327:55.28]Shit.
[328:13.10]Without doing politics, what's your favorite flavor of Doritos?
[328:17.42]I see you now.
[328:19.02]No, Munchos suck.
[328:19.92]That's a joke.
[328:20.66]Nothing I say is real.
[328:21.96]Can we please remember that?
[328:24.54]Munchos taste like salty asshole.
[328:27.49]They disintegrate in your mouth and they taste like just pure salt lick.
[328:32.57]The best chip is baked Lay's.
[328:34.83]Baked Lay's.
[328:36.55]That's my final answer.
[328:47.25]Get the fuck out of here, nothing is real.
[328:49.93]Alright, anyways.
[328:57.67]Lame?
[328:58.60]Why is it lame?
[329:00.84]Look, the amount of times that I've had my mouth cut on baked lays, do you think I would recommend them as my favorite chip?
[329:06.58]Nothing I say is real.
[329:09.56]Every time I eat baked lays, it feels like I just went to the dentist.
[329:14.27]No, it's not that, my favorite chip of all time.
[329:27.24]Thank you to Geodem16 for the $1.
[329:31.76]Without getting into politics, what's your view on politics?
[329:36.14]We're moving on from this one.
[329:37.16]Golden Fishy, thanks for the $10.
[329:41.38]Hey, Jerma, no lie, you've helped me with a lot of depression, too.
[329:43.76]It helped me so much when I got medication, so please suggest people look into it more, because I, for one, didn't want to take it, but it helps.
[329:51.38]It really does.
[329:52.58]So thank you for all the laughs and all the help.
[329:55.66]As...
[329:57.70]famous, world-renowned, skeptic and just intellectual, I don't know if you guys know, used to be a magician, James Randi, once said in an interview, don't be afraid of medicine.
[330:13.99]It's there for a reason, right?
[330:16.29]James Randi, by the way, has awesome talks.
[330:20.17]There's a movie that they just made about him a couple years ago called, um... I think it's... The book is A Magician in the Laboratory.
[330:27.39]Really great.
[330:27.75]James Randi... I'll give a huge shout out to James Randi.
[330:31.73]The James Randi Foundation.
[330:35.15]But he talks a lot about stuff like that because he was going through, I believe, cancer.
[330:39.47]And he... He's a big proponent of, like, don't be afraid of medicine.
[330:44.87]It's designed to help you.
[330:46.77]The Amazing Randi!
[330:47.57]There it is.
[330:47.93]Yeah, he's awesome.
[330:52.97]Uh, medicine makes the frog... No, but... It's... By far... I mean, obviously you have to take... You have to take the step to want to get treated, right?
[331:09.60]And that's hard.
[331:10.20]That's really hard to do that.
[331:12.82]And you should be commended for that.
[331:16.76]Because it's tough to take medicine.
[331:19.03]It's tough to do that.
[331:22.20]but I really wish you the best, GoldenFishy.
[331:27.29]It's about the person.
[331:28.05]Some medicines don't work for others.
[331:30.98]Yeah, that's true, but you and your doctor can figure it out, right?
[331:36.27]Sometimes something's not gonna work.
[331:37.95]I mean, look at me, right?
[331:39.73]This is not in the same... Not in the same realm, but in the same medical field, right?
[331:46.21]It took me, like, about five years to find a medication that, like, worked.
[331:51.70]And when it worked, holy shit, it changed my whole entire life.
[331:57.54]I started a medication, and my illness is like almost as if sometimes it doesn't even exist.
[332:03.88]I take it for like two weeks, if I have a bad flare-up, and this shit goes away for like three months.
[332:09.81]And it was never like that before, even when I was on immunosuppressants, it was horrible.
[332:15.95]Vaccines caused the prequels.
[332:23.92]What the fuck are you talking about?
[332:25.76]But for real.
[332:29.30]No, it was for colitis.
[332:32.48]There's so many different treatments out there.
[332:33.72]And sometimes it takes a combination of doing not just medicine, but more than that.
[332:40.63]You know, medicine, therapy, you kind of have to try to do it all.
[332:46.33]If one thing doesn't work, maybe the other will.
[332:51.96]But much love to you, Golden Fishy.
[332:57.21]I hope you start to feel better.
[332:59.41]And apparently you are, so that's good.
[333:02.47]So Efectator, thanks for the $1, finally subbed after watching for several years.
[333:08.07]Did you see the Jerma Appreciation thread that was on Reddit?
[333:10.31]How did it make you feel?
[333:12.87]I did see that.
[333:15.19]And I...
[333:19.77]I don't really know what to say.
[333:21.21]It's one of those scenarios where, like I've said a thousand times before, it's really hard for me to show you guys, like, that I care.
[333:30.91]And that, like, those threads and stuff like that, in that way of just writing something incredibly nice about me.
[333:39.82]It's... I don't know how to do it.
[333:42.98]I don't know how to give it back.
[333:44.38]I don't know how to tell you that without sounding like it's, like, make-believe or pretend.
[333:54.27]Everything I say is not true.
[333:57.35]Now that's why we're just joking about it a little bit, you know what I mean?
[334:02.81]I wish there was something else I could do or say.
[334:04.77]To those threads and to those people and... You know?
[334:16.00]It's hard for me to express that.
[334:21.80]The memes aren't banned anymore, we're fine.
[334:27.34]And also, I'm going to take this opportunity to shout out the Discord.
[334:32.10]Go to the Discord.
[334:32.84]We were just talking about community stuff in general.
[334:36.44]The Discord is open to the public.
[334:37.56]There is a sub-only version that's inside as a sub-only channel.
[334:41.28]But the whole thing is open besides that.
[334:43.64]General discussion, stream channel.
[334:46.04]If you want to hang out with people that are also hanging out in the streams, go hang out there.
[334:51.70]Because it's a great little community over there.
[334:55.51]And with that, we're going to move on to... Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[334:59.23]I also have to wash my hair every day or I feel dirty.
[335:01.51]It's so annoying.
[335:02.27]It sucks.
[335:03.85]I was talking to Kim.
[335:04.47]Kim was telling me.
[335:05.21]Kim's like, oh, you know, you wash your hair.
[335:06.63]A lot of... If you get your hair treated or if you do certain things, you're not supposed to really wash your hair every single day.
[335:15.45]You know, you can do a little dry shampoo.
[335:17.11]You can run a little bit of water through it and maybe a little bit of conditioner.
[335:20.71]But you're really... I guess you're not supposed to wash your hair every day.
[335:25.76]I can't do that.
[335:27.50]If I don't wash my hair, it's disgusting.
[335:35.69]Use glue.
[335:36.95]Don't do that.
[335:38.27]But yes, I'm the same way, Son of Jenova.
[335:42.13]Gotta wash it every day.
[335:44.01]It like strips oil out of your hair, it makes it worse, but yikes, is it... Is it disgusting if I don't?
[335:52.26]Thank you Topek for the $5.
[335:53.19]Is it selfish that I kind of don't want your Twitch to grow?
[335:56.91]Because I love the interaction with everyone during these streams.
[336:00.44]I mean, this is never gonna change.
[336:02.48]I think I've found the thing that I like to do in regards to, like, interaction.
[336:07.30]I mean, maybe you're talking about in general with the other people that are watching.
[336:11.82]But I was struggling for so long as to how I was gonna handle, like, bits and subs.
[336:17.44]And this, like, 30, 40 minutes, maybe, like, sometimes an hour after the stream is exactly what I want.
[336:27.65]So, hopefully it's been working.
[336:29.99]I really am sorry, though, that a lot of times... ...some people that donated money, like, four hours ago have to wait, like, to the end of the stream... ...for me to acknowledge that.
[336:40.76]But I feel like I like this, um... ...this format here.
[336:48.80]And... ...the community in general...
[336:54.53]I mean, the channel is fairly active and fairly large as it is, right?
[337:00.49]There are, what, potentially two or three thousand viewers here at any given time?
[337:06.62]And yeah, the chat gets kind of out of control and crazy sometimes, but for the most part it's... It seems... It seems like it's going pretty well.
[337:17.83]I know a lot of people, I hear that sometimes, people miss the old days of when there were like four or five hundred people here and we just like played Stardew Valley for like a week straight.
[337:30.90]And it was like, I could just talk to people in the chat, but we have to, as and if the channel gets larger, then we have to obviously adapt to it and figure out ways to make it still possible, right?
[337:47.22]If somebody took the bit reading portions and made them just a podcast, you would listen to it.
[337:52.28]I mean, that's kind of what it is.
[337:54.74]It's just kind of... an open forum for us to sit here and talk.
[338:00.23]And obviously that forum requires money.
[338:03.33]So they're not really open as much as it's a paid forum to talk.
[338:07.17]And that's not what I'm trying to do here, but... I can kind of just go off on anything and just talk about anything here.
[338:15.47]And hopefully it's working.
[338:18.41]But, uh, mostly lost thanks to the $5.
[338:20.71]Jerma, the way you responded to those bits earlier reminded me of why we all love you.
[338:24.01]You had a positive influence on more lives than you'll ever know.
[338:28.20]I just hope I can be able to be as positive of an influence someday.
[338:33.28]And if you are thinking that way, then I'm so glad and I feel like I hope I'm doing something right.
[338:44.75]I don't know.
[338:45.49]Sometimes I fucking fly off the handle.
[338:47.81]But if you want to be a positive influence on somebody, or if you want to do something, and you want to fucking go for something, then go for it.
[338:54.56]I'm happy.
[338:56.58]Because it's not the other direction.
[338:57.76]It's not the other way around.
[338:59.74]I would feel so terrible if people, if like I had like a negative influence on people, or a negative energy that people were taking from these streams and videos.
[339:09.58]I would be so upset.
[339:12.00]And sometimes that does happen, like when I do fly off the handle and get really annoyed at something,
[339:16.33]And like I said, it happens like maybe once every couple months, maybe.
[339:19.51]I hate having that like negative atmosphere.
[339:22.59]And I really hope it doesn't rub off on anybody.
[339:27.97]But I'm really glad to hear that lost.
[339:30.03]Thank you, dude.
[339:32.27]Negative streamer.
[339:34.54]Igloo Superman, thanks for the $1.
[339:38.26]What do you do to, what do you use to wash your wig?
[339:40.58]I mean, you're not bald head.
[339:43.04]I use a sea salt shampoo, and then a lemon zest, and egg yolk conditioner.
[339:52.74]Thank you.
[339:54.27]Moo means moo, thanks for the $1.
[339:55.67]If you like some really energetic and noisy punk music, that's a ton of fun to listen to.
[340:00.15]You should check out Brutalism by Idles.
[340:03.81]It's an album from last year that I came back to a ton.
[340:08.23]Hope you check it out.
[340:11.12]I've never heard of it.
[340:11.94]Maybe I'll give it a try.
[340:13.01]I'm not like a huge punk music fan.
[340:16.33]I'm more of the... I don't even... I can't even answer that question.
[340:21.17]I'm not... I'm a fan of nothing.
[340:22.95]I like a lot of things, but I'm not a fan of a lot of things.
[340:26.01]You know, I enjoy stuff, but not necessarily fan of it.
[340:30.43]What the fuck am I talking about?
[340:32.31]Moo means boo.
[340:32.91]Thanks for the $1.
[340:33.25]Remember the ass-eating radical centrist.
[340:36.29]That's me.
[340:38.11]E. Strong, thanks for the $1.
[340:39.45]If you aren't a die-hard evangelical classical liberal classicalist, I'm unsubscribing.
[340:46.56]Thank you, Devlon, $2 million for the $1.
[340:48.32]But vaccines implant nanochip trackers in our children.
[340:50.86]I can't believe this radical streamer would encourage and endanger our American children from money.
[341:00.88]Thank you, Samuel Sish for the $5.
[341:02.18]I know I'm hoping...
[341:04.48]I know I'm hopping on the depression bandwagon here, but I went through some stuff about two years ago.
[341:09.09]Found your stuff shortly after.
[341:10.37]I struggled with suicidal thoughts and my grades plummeted.
[341:14.83]Now I'm getting my scholarships back and I'm laughing every day with help from your videos.
[341:19.89]Jeremy, you're a goddamn blessing.
[341:21.76]Thank you.
[341:26.02]That's... I'm just floored to hear stuff like that.
[341:31.80]You understand?
[341:32.34]Like, that floors me when I hear this shit.
[341:36.37]I'll be in the shower sometimes, and just randomly I'll think of one of these things that somebody's told me.
[341:41.61]For instance, like, you.
[341:43.81]And it's just like, fuck.
[341:44.93]Like, it floors me.
[341:45.97]It absolutely floors me.
[341:48.61]And if I can be any fucking positive influence on you, I'm so happy about that.
[341:53.46]I'm going to continue to do it.
[341:55.16]I will continue to fucking do this until I, until 2026.
[342:00.18]No, forever.
[342:03.06]But I'm going to kind of parrot the same thing we said before is talk to somebody, get yourself in check, take care of yourself.
[342:13.51]Take care of yourself first.
[342:16.39]Right?
[342:17.37]Like you need to take care of yourself first.
[342:23.27]There's so many ways to do it.
[342:25.39]There's resources.
[342:26.25]Talk to somebody.
[342:27.85]Get on one of those hotlines if you need to.
[342:30.91]You have to just air it out and let somebody know.
[342:33.85]Don't just bottle it in.
[342:35.87]It's not good for you.
[342:41.81]But thank you so much for the five bucks, man.
[342:45.77]I'm so happy that you're getting shit back on track, it seems.
[342:49.71]Getting your scholarships back.
[342:53.34]And stick around.
[342:58.05]Much love to you, dude.
[343:01.31]And then to end it all here, Petrol Sniffer to end the stream.
[343:06.21]Thanks for the $1.
[343:06.97]Just discovered you like a week ago, but you're one of my favorite people ever.
[343:09.33]Thank you.
[343:09.72]Thank you, Petrol.
[343:12.32]Welcome.
[343:13.32]I'm glad you found me.
[343:15.04]Hey, no, I'm glad I found you.
[343:16.08]What's that?
[343:17.58]Did I stop digging around here?
[343:18.86]Hey, there's a Petrol Sniffer here.
[343:22.20]Let's grab you and put you in the pocket.
[343:24.04]Let's just take him home.
[343:25.90]You're like a little friend.
[343:30.11]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[343:33.05]And an unbitchable sniffer.
[343:34.75]Good night, everybody.
[343:41.77]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[343:43.29]I'm going to stream early tomorrow.
[343:45.35]Tomorrow's going to be the last time I stream Kingdom Come.
[343:48.92]So however far I get in the game, that's it.
[343:53.27]Maybe I'll continue it off stream, but Thursday again, we'll go back to PlayStation 1.
[343:58.95]Got some more stuff to do.
[344:00.51]See you tomorrow.
[344:01.09]Probably 12 p.m.
[344:01.89]Eastern time.
[344:03.19]Have a great one.
[344:03.95]Good night, everybody.
[344:04.73]See you soon.
[344:24.38]We got one final donation here.
[344:25.98]I was about to click the stop streaming button.
[344:29.20]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[344:31.27]Thank you, Moo.
[344:32.71]Just want to say that you definitely made a huge positive influence on us.
[344:35.47]I don't know if you remember this stream, but in one of the comb streams, I talked about being stuck creatively about making music.
[344:41.95]And you told me to try making something new outside of what I would usually do.
[344:45.96]To which chat replied to eat ass.
[344:47.68]And now I've been able to get much more into my hobby.
[344:51.76]And I wanted to say that I appreciate your words.
[344:53.84]They kind of pushed me to enjoy my hobby I love again.
[344:57.00]I'm so glad to hear that.
[344:59.02]Keep doing it.
[345:00.06]Challenge yourself every fucking day.
[345:02.96]Even if it's like something simple.
[345:07.56]Try something new.
[345:10.65]If you get stuck, try something new.
[345:12.85]Something you've fucking never done before, and I'm glad that you did.
[345:17.32]Thank you so much, Moo.
[345:22.72]And I've mostly lost right now, right before the button turns off.
[345:27.71]I've been told that if we keep donating, the stream will never end.
[345:30.29]That's not true, because it's over now.
[345:31.87]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[345:32.93]See you tomorrow.
[345:34.05]Good night.
[345:34.51]Good luck.
[345:34.93]Take care.
[345:36.59]Love y'all.
[345:38.12]See you tomorrow.
