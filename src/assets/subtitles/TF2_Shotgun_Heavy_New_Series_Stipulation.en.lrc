[00:08.91]Hey what's up everybody Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight I got a very special Team Fortress 2 upload tonight because this is the start of a new series I want to do.
[00:22.20]But let's back up for just a second here I want to give you guys the origin I guess of this series.
[00:28.20]So a long time ago I did a video well not really a long time ago more like maybe a month or so ago.
[00:34.07]I uploaded a Crusader's Crossbow Medic bonus clip on top.
[00:38.23]I think it was a Huntsman Sniper gameplay.
[00:40.21]But if you remember that, I called it a stipulation match, where I was only allowed to use one item or two items, and it was a very strange way of doing things.
[00:49.95]And I believe in that one, it was I could only use the crossbow to heal people or damage people.
[00:55.60]I could not use the Medi Gun.
[00:57.78]It was definitely a whole lot of fun, so I decided to turn it into a series, and this is episode 1 of Stipulation, where just like in that crossbow video, I'm only allowed a certain set of rules or guidelines or item sets, and I have to stick to those rules.
[01:15.99]So I'm going to start the series off with the Heavy, and I really do first right off the bat apologize for this, because it's been at least a month or two, at least that, since my last Heavy gameplay.
[01:27.04]And the reason why that is, is I just honestly don't really play Heavy that much anymore.
[01:31.55]I play him every now and then, just kind of joking around, messing around, but I haven't really sat down to play Heavy in a long time.
[01:38.13]But I did it this time.
[01:39.86]So let's start talking about the stipulation.
[01:41.58]You probably know what it is by now by watching the screen.
[01:44.94]Only allowed to use the Fists of Steel and the family business shotgun.
[01:49.37]I am not allowed to use that minigun.
[01:52.15]Minigun off limits.
[01:53.65]That is the stipulation.
[01:55.49]You'd actually be quite surprised that this setup does work very, very well.
[02:00.16]As you're seeing in this gameplay, I'm killing quite a few people, and I've only died one time.
[02:04.96]So if you guys are liking what you're seeing here, and you want to try this out on your own sometime, this is the strategy I was using.
[02:12.15]You want to walk around with the Fists of Steel up pretty much at all times.
[02:16.92]The only times you want to drop the Fists of Steel is if you get close enough to shoot someone with your shotgun.
[02:22.74]And you can also duke people out and fake people out.
[02:24.89]You'll see coming up here, me and this pyro get into it.
[02:27.43]And every so often, I'll bring up the Fists of Steel.
[02:29.87]Because if you don't know, the Fists of Steel absorb 40% of the damage you take.
[02:34.21]When you have them up, that is.
[02:35.90]So this setup really, it's not that bad.
[02:37.82]If you can time when people are going to shoot at you, and then after they're out of ammo or they're running out of ammo, like a soldier for instance, let's say he shoots two or three rockets at you while you have these things active, and you absorb a lot of that damage, you only have one rocket to worry about now.
[02:52.41]So you can just put these things down, whip up the shotgun, put the guy full of lead and he might miss you, or he might hit you and it might not kill you.
[02:59.63]So definitely, definitely give this a try.
[03:02.24]It is a whole lot of fun.
[03:03.50]It takes you out of that typical heavy gameplay where you pull down the minigun and just...
[03:10.56]It takes you out of that.
[03:12.00]It's also going to give you a reason to put on that shotgun.
[03:15.21]Because let's face it, guys, let's be totally honest, not very many people use the shotgun as the heavy.
[03:21.47]Nobody, especially the family business, my goodness.
[03:24.05]This thing pretty much collects dust in everybody's cabinets.
[03:27.98]So definitely give it a try.
[03:29.20]Take the sandwich off for once and just go out and have fun.
[03:33.07]You probably just saw the top frag in that last gameplay right there.
[03:36.71]I really didn't top frag.
[03:38.59]I was playing as a different class earlier in that round, and the round was going on forever.
[03:42.74]And I just decided, okay, let's just do this now.
[03:45.48]I'm going to do the heavy with the shotgun and the fist of steel.
[03:48.66]I think I was actually playing as a sniper earlier.
[03:51.64]So just disregard that.
[03:54.17]So let's talk about the gameplay for a second here.
[03:56.37]I'm currently stuck inside of this building right now because there's a heavy outside, and I think MLC_St3alth just got the backstab on him.
[04:03.73]We were in Skype, and he's like, oh, I got that heavy, and I went, oh, thank God, because as the stipulation goes, I would have just got my ass totally handed to me right there.
[04:12.89]So thank you, MLC_St3alth, for saving my life.
[04:16.89]I get behind these two guys right here, kill the soldier with my Fists of Steel, and then I put the pyro six feet under as well, kill him with the shotgun, jump around here to the corner, I go down in that building again, just trying to get some more health and some more ammo, even though I don't really need the ammo.
[04:31.31]So at this point I'm thinking, maybe I should get on that cart.
[04:34.96]I don't know why I thought this was a good idea.
[04:37.48]Maybe I just forgot that I couldn't use my minigun because I see this pyro.
[04:40.86]And then watch, I get air blasted almost off the cliff.
[04:43.66]Oh my god, it almost happens twice.
[04:46.00]I don't know how I ended up surviving that.
[04:48.08]I should have gone right off of that goddamn cliff.
[04:50.62]But the gods of Hightower were on my side at that point.
[04:54.95]So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, I'm checking this spy over and over again.
[04:58.43]I don't know why, I could have just bumped into him.
[05:00.45]Like, are you a spy?
[05:01.29]No.
[05:01.47]Are you a spy?
[05:02.21]No, he's not.
[05:03.63]I get a lucky crit on this Pyro, pull up the Fist of Steel and shabaum right in his face, and then I get the Karma because I get crit right in my face.
[05:13.35]So that is going to be the end of this gameplay, guys.
[05:16.06]Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[05:18.86]Just wanted to showcase another small clip, I guess, of using this setup.
[05:23.50]And if you have any suggestions, if you guys want to see a certain stipulation, then definitely, definitely drop me a comment and we'll go from there.
[05:31.84]So thanks, guys, again.
[05:33.07]I'll see you all soon.
[05:34.27]And take care, everybody.
