[01:45.37]Hey!
[01:47.71]Where is he?
[01:50.27]He's somewhere.
[01:51.01]You'll find him.
[01:51.71]You'll find him soon enough.
[01:54.24]Welcome to the stream.
[01:56.36]I'm like out of breath.
[01:57.20]I walked up and down stairs.
[01:59.96]That takes a lot out of you.
[02:03.92]Anyways, how are you doing guys?
[02:04.94]Good afternoon.
[02:07.00]I mean, good afternoon to the people in West Coast, USA.
[02:10.69]Because that's what I'm used to.
[02:12.53]I'm used to being awake on the West Coast.
[02:16.87]Because of TwitchCon.
[02:18.65]TwitchCon was fun.
[02:20.31]If you like streaming, if you like streamers, I suggest you do it next year.
[02:26.07]Let me just make a Twitter response video.
[02:29.62]I'll be right there.
[02:30.44]One second.
[03:13.53]Alright.
[03:14.81]What do you say we start playing this video game?
[03:18.15]Hey, thank you, Stix.
[03:20.63]Stix Renegade and Sinbad Returns.
[03:23.81]Stix with 250, Sinbad with $1.
[03:25.81]Thank you.
[03:26.31]Can I get my Twitch loot box now?
[03:29.79]They're not actually doing that, right?
[03:32.25]That's kind of like a little experimental joke, right?
[03:34.39]Let's switch this over.
[03:38.29]If they are, that's really strange.
[03:42.03]Hey, look, monsters.
[03:44.18]Look at that guy!
[03:47.34]Good commentary.
[03:48.08]Hey, look at that guy!
[03:48.98]Alright, let's turn that on.
[03:55.53]Yeah, so you play as Gordon Freeman in a prison.
[04:02.35]You know, I can't even think right now.
[04:06.30]I'm having some thinking trouble.
[04:09.05]You guys didn't hear it, but I was just, like, excruciatingly angry trying to get this game to work.
[04:14.71]So, like, sorry, I'm, like, not quite with it yet.
[04:18.96]I'll get over it.
[04:20.26]But, like, I wanted to strangle this fucking game.
[04:22.48]Because, remember, if you play a game, this is why, like, we're going to have a huge problem in the next, like, 20 years.
[04:29.42]Hear me out on this one.
[04:31.43]So, in like 20 fucking years, all this shit's not going to exist.
[04:35.01]You're not going to be able to play any of these games.
[04:36.81]Even like Star Fox 2.
[04:38.95]Star Fox 64.
[04:39.47]You're not going to be able to play them anymore.
[04:42.18]They're not going to be compatible with anything.
[04:46.92]Like Destiny 3 is not going to work in 30 years.
[04:51.14]What are we looking at?
[04:58.63]The suffering more like an average Jerma stream.
[05:01.03]Hey, get over it.
[05:02.47]Get over it.
[05:03.02]This is how it is.
[05:05.86]We play as mutton chops guy and we make fun of how funny it is.
[05:11.06]Get over it.
[05:11.68]Alright, let's go.
[05:17.62]No more killing time.
[05:18.58]Although this is like very fucking loud.
[05:21.87]Watch the game just cry.
[05:22.93]Oh look, you get to be Deadpool.
[05:24.33]Oh shit, did I break it?
[05:27.91]I may have broke it.
[05:28.65]No, I didn't.
[05:30.73]One thing that we are going to have to deal with, I need to... Oh, boy.
[05:34.51]Alright.
[05:38.17]The delay.
[05:38.79]Oh, no.
[05:42.36]Vertical sync.
[05:43.02]No, turn it off.
[05:43.84]Turn vertical sync off.
[05:44.96]Oh, I can't.
[05:45.84]What if it goes crazy?
[05:46.78]What if I lose everything here?
[05:49.92]Motion blur.
[05:50.68]Oh, get that out of here.
[05:53.04]Gamma.
[05:53.40]Turn it up a little.
[05:55.32]Shadows.
[05:56.18]Should I turn these down?
[05:57.46]Player only.
[05:58.14]Okay.
[06:03.13]Get on the graphics tab.
[06:04.27]Audio.
[06:05.05]You see like the weird Five Nights at Freddy's guy that comes in your face?
[06:10.07]I'm more loud.
[06:10.93]I'm loud today?
[06:11.95]Okay.
[06:14.95]Alright, let's go.
[06:16.23]I've already wasted enough time.
[06:17.79]Listen to, like, the weird, like, violin screeching.
[06:19.86]I mean, it's a horror game.
[06:20.72]Welcome to the Halloween week.
[06:22.80]Halloween 2017.
[06:25.14]Like, I'm giving the... Who cares, right?
[06:26.72]Let's go.
[06:27.14]New game.
[06:28.38]Easy, medium, hard, impossible.
[06:30.00]We're not gonna... We're just gonna do medium.
[06:32.30]The worst place on Earth.
[06:34.56]I couldn't read that.
[06:36.40]I swear, Abbott's full enough already.
[06:40.71]At least when you escort an inmate to death row, you know he's scheduled to get what he deserves.
[06:44.49]Ernesto, you can really be a jackass.
[06:46.38]You know that.
[06:47.28]You hear what this one did?
[06:48.50]I don't want to know.
[06:50.08]He beat his ex-wife to a bleeding pulp.
[06:51.88]What the hell is that?
[06:53.42]Is that like naked guys in there?
[06:55.66]Then he drowned one son in the tub and threw the other out a window.
[06:58.65]Don't ask me to cry for him.
[07:01.89]So that's the main character.
[07:02.81]Who is talking?
[07:03.27]Probably the guy that's move his mouth is moving.
[07:05.59]And why do I get like a box like I just got fired from work?
[07:19.54]Willie's bed isn't even cold yet, and already they brought in a new guy.
[07:23.34]Yeah, well, sorry guys.
[07:24.32]I just got fired.
[07:24.70]Why should I?
[07:25.06]That's Tork, the man himself.
[07:36.90]Word is, he sheared half the Aryan Brotherhood over at East.
[07:41.86]So fucking what?
[07:43.04]I can understand a guy killing his old lady, but he popped his kids too.
[07:46.84]Motherfucker deserves to be strapped down and dosed.
[07:49.11]This game's gonna get nuts.
[07:53.29]You don't know shit about the man.
[07:55.85]I'm telling you what I heard I Thought I just threw my shoe out suckers not gonna be alright for the rest of a short time Show cracker.
[08:05.45]We just got we went there respect show him respect.
[08:09.49]Yes.
[08:09.71]I do I respect shit boy.
[08:11.48]Don't you go tell me?
[08:15.22]Well, for those of you that are kids, hopefully you're not here.
[08:18.53]Okay, so there we are.
[08:19.73]Hopefully you're not here.
[08:20.63]You're kids.
[08:21.23]Yeah, you.
[08:22.13]Neighbor.
[08:23.01]Nice to meet you.
[08:23.59]My name's Floyd.
[08:24.75]How long you got till your turn on the table, huh?
[08:26.57]You all out of appeals?
[08:27.61]Your lawyer fuck you?
[08:28.84]I read about your trial.
[08:29.68]They got no witnesses.
[08:30.96]All circumstances.
[08:31.94]Alright, so I'm 17 and older.
[08:33.02]This isn't a horror of a Halloween horror stream.
[08:36.66]Best not to listen to him talk.
[08:39.43]Floyd's a degenerate parasite.
[08:41.89]They should have slapped the cuffs on him coming out of his mama's chest.
[08:45.01]At least I know Jesus is with me, man.
[08:47.41]That guy's the first to die.
[08:49.32]The reverend says Jesus is forgiving me.
[08:51.56]Will you shut the fuck up?
[08:53.70]You baby raping, sodomizing sack of shit.
[08:57.66]I was just asking the man a question, Goose.
[09:00.26]Alright, well, we've already gone there.
[09:03.78]So, there you go.
[09:04.98]We've already been here.
[09:07.32]We already went there.
[09:08.36]Uh, now there's an earthquake.
[09:10.19]Holy shit.
[09:24.55]This game's a little too much for me.
[09:27.99]It's not PG-13 anymore.
[09:30.07]Forget about the guy on the roof.
[09:34.03]I don't know what's going on.
[09:35.17]This guy's gonna lose his body parts.
[09:48.97]That was close.
[09:49.97]I thought we were done for.
[09:51.72]We gotta get out of this shit can before it collapses.
[09:53.22]Is that my weapon?
[09:54.02]It's like a Polaroid for a weapon.
[09:55.74]There's something in here.
[09:57.48]It's in here!
[09:58.70]Help me!
[10:02.40]Well, all the characters that it's introduced are all gone.
[10:04.93]Alright.
[10:08.69]You played this game when you were a kid?
[10:11.65]Oh my god.
[10:12.49]What the fuck is going on right now?
[10:14.25]This game is too dark.
[10:15.17]I can't see anything.
[10:18.29]Where do I go?
[10:23.61]I played this game when I was a kid.
[10:25.51]That's fucking terrifying.
[10:29.88]Oh, well.
[10:30.42]Oh my god.
[10:31.72]They just skewed him.
[10:37.36]Everything's happening too fast.
[10:39.14]It was a bunch of, like, awful shit.
[10:40.70]A bunch of awful commentary.
[10:44.02]We teleported around...
[10:47.20]What is this?
[10:48.26]Okay, I got a knife.
[10:51.44]Press mouse 1 or number pad 0 to attack.
[10:54.04]Alright, so that's that.
[10:56.94]Keep going.
[10:58.40]What was that?
[11:00.68]Okay, I think I just have to keep moving here.
[11:03.92]Do I have to melee these things?
[11:06.61]Use mouse 4, enter or left alt to look at mouse 4.
[11:13.25]Okay.
[11:13.49]Use mouse 4 to look through the monitors.
[11:16.41]Oh, here we go.
[11:17.57]This is where we're going to watch these guys get killed by the aliens.
[11:23.05]Oh!
[11:23.21]Alright.
[11:28.19]This game, okay, for like 2001, this game's actually fairly... There's a way out over here!
[11:37.00]There's a way out.
[11:38.06]Let's go follow this guy.
[11:46.17]He was still saying that.
[11:47.49]He was still talking while that was on him.
[11:52.40]We can get out this way.
[11:53.58]Thank God I made it into the light.
[11:55.42]I think I'm safe in the light.
[11:58.22]You've got to get me out of here.
[12:04.20]No!
[12:05.14]And... Aw, that was a Baraka fatality.
[12:12.26]He just covered me in blood.
[12:14.98]Thanks for spray painting me.
[12:17.88]Alright, now where?
[12:19.02]Down here?
[12:19.36]I see this.
[12:23.82]Is the door going to be open?
[12:24.98]Yep.
[12:25.48]We're going to the Colt's Gorge.
[12:29.22]No, I think I already... Yeah, this is where the monitors were.
[12:31.31]Can I press this button?
[12:33.13]What is that?
[12:35.23]Oh, that's... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[12:36.13]We gotta go in there.
[12:36.69]I hear breathing.
[12:42.15]I hear very heavy breathing, actually.
[12:45.97]Zombium bottle.
[12:47.45]I think that's just healing.
[12:51.09]Oh, this health.
[12:56.56]Alright, that way don't work.
[12:58.94]I didn't look this way yet.
[13:00.66]Down towards administration.
[13:05.99]What's with every... Oh, hold on.
[13:09.10]I was going to say, what's with every horror game where the people can just boot down doors?
[13:12.99]I don't understand.
[13:15.49]Every single one.
[13:16.27]From Resident Evil to The Suffering.
[13:18.99]That's my gauge of horror games.
[13:21.19]Resident Evil to The Suffering.
[13:24.13]Zombiums.
[13:24.63]It's like the shower.
[13:34.80]Wait, why did everybody play this game as a kid?
[13:40.32]Okay, well, that's one with a dead body.
[13:42.24]What about this one?
[13:45.42]Why do these guys don't have guns?
[13:48.20]I feel like I'm gonna turn the camera.
[13:49.32]The fucking telephone's ringing.
[13:51.93]Hello, yes, it's me, the guy we're escaping.
[13:55.17]T, listen to me.
[13:56.39]You gotta get out of there.
[13:57.81]That island's more than just a prison.
[13:59.23]It's so much worse.
[14:00.53]It brings out the worst in everyone.
[14:07.21]How would you... Why would you call this phone?
[14:09.23]I have all the phones in the entire prison.
[14:13.28]You think I'm gonna pick this one up?
[14:16.52]Let me, uh... Wait a second.
[14:20.24]We gotta get some gamma here, you know?
[14:23.36]A little too dark.
[14:24.58]I don't think that even did anything.
[14:28.62]Yeah, I didn't... How did they know I even answered the phone?
[14:34.04]I'm gonna call a random phone in the whole prison.
[14:37.77]Fuck I guess stuff like joking around.
[14:39.79]Oh use wheel down to navigate inventory This phone gonna ring
[15:05.62]Please tell me this phone rings too, right?
[15:07.31]Can I open up the briefcase?
[15:09.61]I mean, the file cabinet?
[15:14.81]Flashlight ba- Oh, I got a flashlight!
[15:16.17]How do I turn it on?
[15:19.80]How do I turn on the flashlight?
[15:25.08]No, I can turn the lights on.
[15:27.72]Should've done that from the very beginning.
[15:32.09]I just wanna make sure it opens.
[15:37.44]Okay, um... I'm not sure, like, where else... Like, where I haven't gone yet.
[15:42.90]This is where the phone rang.
[15:45.38]I was already here.
[15:48.87]So we were already down this way, but we didn't go over here, right?
[15:53.15]Oh, come on.
[15:53.55]It's a locked door.
[15:54.15]Oh, that's horse shit.
[15:57.39]Where's the light for this place?
[16:02.85]This doesn't look like Baldur's Gate.
[16:06.48]Bald escape.
[16:10.18]This is what that guy was.
[16:11.74]That's what that guy said, follow me.
[16:13.32]Anyone read me?
[16:16.20]What's going on?
[16:17.42]Is it a riot?
[16:19.04]What's the situation?
[16:21.93]I can't see what's going on.
[16:24.59]I hear sounds, and when I shine the spot down there, it's like everything scampers out of the way.
[16:30.05]I can't see well enough.
[16:31.81]Shit, get away from me.
[16:33.03]Where does this game take place?
[16:37.62]Or is this just one guy doing a bunch of voices?
[16:41.17]Goddamn inmates behind this, I know they are.
[16:43.89]Is anyone listening to me?
[16:44.73]Gee, to look at maps.
[16:50.09]Okay, so this is actually a real blueprint.
[16:54.03]Death House is the name of this place.
[16:57.30]Let's see, center the map.
[16:58.30]Okay, that's me.
[16:59.14]Alright.
[17:02.10]Somebody killed that guy.
[17:06.17]This guy just keeps turning on the mic and doing voice work.
[17:09.01]He's practicing.
[17:09.69]We got our first checkpoint of the game.
[17:13.77]And we might have our first enemy.
[17:17.41]I'm not sure.
[17:18.01]I don't know how well you fight in this game or how combat works.
[17:23.47]Let's check this door over here.
[17:28.27]Locked.
[17:32.48]I actually am kind of scared.
[17:37.83]There's another guy crawling, except this guy is completely in one piece.
[17:41.01]Not anymore.
[17:45.51]Oh god.
[17:48.11]Alright, here we go.
[17:53.04]Is there like a dodge roll?
[17:59.46]Okay.
[18:00.18]Watch out!
[18:02.18]Page, I'm...
[18:04.40]Alright, he's dead.
[18:06.20]No, they're not that difficult.
[18:17.91]Watch that, inmate, or I will fuck you up!
[18:20.41]Hold it right there, or I will cut you down!
[18:23.07]You hear me, inmate?
[18:24.35]Do you hear me?
[18:25.73]Yes.
[18:28.74]Give him a chance.
[18:30.68]Who's talking?
[18:32.34]Right now, I prefer a murdering scum-fuck from the road to one of those monstrosities.
[18:35.84]Why is the darkness talking to me?
[18:37.06]You've got a better chance to survive if we stick together.
[18:38.90]Kill him, Jackie.
[18:40.94]Or I will punch a hole in your sorry ass.
[18:43.01]Got it?
[18:43.51]Got it!
[18:43.85]Calm down.
[18:44.63]Fuck you.
[18:48.29]I don't know what to listen to!
[18:53.25]Oh!
[18:53.35]You're gonna blow my head off.
[18:58.39]Okay.
[18:59.24]Well, where's the flashlight?
[19:00.96]I'm not gonna keep him alive.
[19:02.08]We're gonna be good.
[19:04.06]A guy with a gun is a... A guy with a gun is two in the hand and one in the gun and two in the bush.
[19:07.96]You know what I'm saying?
[19:10.81]A bird in the gun is worth two in the hand.
[19:13.35]That's what I say.
[19:13.93]So this guy's dead.
[19:18.61]Anything else?
[19:20.09]Can I flush the toilet?
[19:25.03]Come on.
[19:25.69]Hold on, let me just waste water.
[19:28.87]That's the real horror.
[19:31.09]We're in California.
[19:33.05]It's a drought.
[19:33.57]Terrifying.
[19:40.51]Go find yourself a flashlight, and I may get us out alive.
[19:43.37]Okay, in the break room.
[19:44.65]So where are we?
[19:47.11]Break room.
[19:49.27]Uh, where's the break room?
[19:50.13]This is the D-Block Electrical WC Locker Room.
[19:53.21]Yeah.
[19:54.92]I don't see a break room.
[19:59.06]Holy shit, there's a lot of fucking places.
[20:01.56]Witness area.
[20:03.64]Witness area.
[20:04.32]Each infirmary.
[20:05.82]Control station.
[20:07.00]Witness processing.
[20:07.86]Where's the break room?! !
[20:12.54]Like a locker room?
[20:13.48]A lot of the lights were destroyed in that earthquake.
[20:18.08]You'll need a flashlight to see a damn thing.
[20:21.33]We'll just go into the locker room.
[20:25.01]Okay, give me that flashlight.
[20:26.23]Watch out.
[20:26.61]I'm going to have to fight a doobie here.
[20:28.43]So this is where Outlast got the battery idea from, huh?
[20:35.64]Use F to turn the flashlight on and off.
[20:38.52]Finally.
[20:40.82]What am I doing?
[20:47.34]I'm not sure now is the time for this.
[20:50.46]Oh, I'm trying to push it.
[20:52.24]So do it.
[20:52.68]There's probably something behind here.
[20:58.20]I'm wasting battery.
[21:01.14]No.
[21:01.62]I don't want to Fonz this.
[21:02.70]I don't want to do the Fonz.
[21:04.14]I want to open this one.
[21:08.34]This guy looks like the Fonz too.
[21:11.46]You know what?
[21:13.35]I look like the Fonz.
[21:15.87]I'm just coming to this realization now.
[21:17.71]I could be the Fonz for Halloween if I, like, dyed my hair black.
[21:21.39]I should do that.
[21:22.93]Like, in a couple years.
[21:25.93]Let's go.
[21:28.97]Alright, I got a flashlight.
[21:29.98]You got it.
[21:33.66]Yes, sir!
[21:45.42]You want me to be like the light guy?
[21:46.60]I can do that.
[21:47.18]As long as you're good at shooting.
[21:51.95]Kill him, Jackie.
[21:53.27]Alright, I gotta protect this.
[21:55.01]Let's turn the lights on.
[21:58.79]Hey.
[21:59.37]Hey.
[22:01.95]No, shit.
[22:02.97]No, turn it off.
[22:03.57]Turn it off.
[22:05.52]Where is he?
[22:06.18]Where is he?
[22:06.80]Get him.
[22:15.67]Come on!
[22:16.92]Get him!
[22:17.76]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[22:18.94]Alright, we're good.
[22:21.74]You just took, like, a knife to the chest.
[22:24.18]Oh, my God.
[22:26.24]Alright, well, we just got envisaged, like, twice in a row.
[22:31.03]Yeah, I did see it.
[22:37.49]Carnate Island's got a strange history, and Abbott is one fucked up foos girl.
[22:41.59]Let me tell you, we better stay away from the fucking basement.
[22:44.75]If things are bad up here, down there, it's gonna be like the mouth of hell.
[22:48.29]I always saw the good in you.
[22:50.55]Help me!
[22:55.11]It won't stop!
[22:57.75]I gotta check it out.
[22:58.67]Stay here!
[23:00.21]I always knew you were a good guy.
[23:01.91]What was that?
[23:03.77]Was that like the angel on my shoulder?
[23:05.91]No more!
[23:11.19]What?
[23:12.29]Can I have his gun?
[23:15.81]Okay.
[23:21.48]Oh, Jesus!
[23:26.40]He might have been okay.
[23:28.30]He might have been alright, but not anymore.
[23:33.70]Whoops, I'm sorry.
[23:35.00]Ah!
[23:38.88]Can I get in this?
[23:40.50]Why would I get in this chair?
[23:41.90]Alright, here comes like a puzzle.
[23:48.51]Can I shoot these?
[23:49.17]I don't think that's going to do anything.
[23:53.77]Can I break them?
[23:55.69]No.
[23:56.97]I think they're all connected to like inside of a room somewhere, right?
[23:59.69]Like over here.
[24:00.29]Why can I not turn these off?
[24:01.51]Turn it off.
[24:07.86]He lasted longer than the others.
[24:09.37]What's going on here?
[24:10.65]Why are these all protected by powerward shields?
[24:14.87]Can I shoot the glass?
[24:23.24]Alright, stand back!
[24:26.08]No.
[24:31.52]Okay, well, I think I have to go like a round.
[24:33.56]Because this is not doing anything.
[24:38.87]Although, was it up or down?
[24:40.11]It was down.
[24:40.60]It was up, right?
[24:41.12]I gotta put it down.
[24:45.46]Wow reference, I know.
[24:46.82]Really.
[24:48.78]With the ship equipped, I can break stuff.
[24:52.12]Alright, that works.
[24:53.84]Oh, wait, give me that.
[24:54.38]Give me that zombie.
[24:59.68]It was down?
[25:00.32]Was it actually down?
[25:03.06]How do I use the zombie?
[25:13.31]So it was down, so that means I have to put it up.
[25:18.81]Hold on.
[25:19.29]Did you say that somebody's performing Reiki on me?
[25:25.35]Oh, what the fuck?
[25:26.23]Get out of the way.
[25:26.95]Alright, so there's another phone call.
[25:34.94]Wait, where's this phone?
[25:36.36]Hold on.
[25:37.78]In there.
[25:38.08]Ugh.
[25:41.86]Thank God I reached you again.
[25:43.36]What a coincidence of calling a random number.
[25:45.62]There's nobody there.
[25:51.27]What?
[25:53.55]It's a different phone.
[25:56.55]Which phone is this one?
[26:00.97]Is it this phone?
[26:01.61]Hello?
[26:01.85]Hello, Ma.
[26:04.06]It's me, Willie.
[26:04.74]Yeah, they said I could talk as long as I wanted.
[26:07.18]No, that's okay.
[26:08.60]I told you I didn't
[26:14.20]Why was I able to... Why was I able to pick up the other phone?
[26:19.02]Alright, so I'm obviously having trouble here.
[26:26.18]Let me save the game.
[26:28.04]This is one of those games where you save the... Look at how many kilobytes free I have.
[26:31.02]1, 2, 3.
[26:31.08]1, 2, 3.
[26:31.14]It's okay, guys.
[26:31.54]I have 180 million kilobytes.
[26:43.52]Hopefully this doesn't break while I go like this.
[26:47.61]That's good.
[26:49.11]That's good.
[26:49.79]You just need to move that around.
[26:52.57]Okay.
[26:53.25]How's the audio?
[26:54.11]Is the audio like in a good spot?
[26:56.23]What'd you say?
[26:58.20]Would you guys say the audio is in like a good place right now?
[27:01.44]What do you think?
[27:07.34]It's good.
[27:07.72]Audio is fine.
[27:08.28]It's not like overpowering or anything.
[27:09.50]Alright.
[27:11.23]Let's go.
[27:13.47]Okay.
[27:18.73]Turn this back on.
[27:20.74]To push and pull objects, press and hold that button.
[27:23.18]Rip.
[27:28.84]So I had to... Let me just... Let me quickly go over some bits here.
[27:35.08]ProStar, thanks for the 342.
[27:38.64]Hey, what's up, Fred?
[27:39.67]Hold on.
[27:43.12]Looks like there's gonna be mice coming out of these.
[27:44.58]Alright, we gotta do a checkpoint.
[27:46.74]I'm good.
[27:47.22]I'm gonna pull out the revolver.
[27:48.22]I don't know how much... How much ammo do you get in this game?
[27:50.28]Is it one of those low ammo games?
[27:51.26]Alright, well this is definitely on purpose.
[27:59.31]Why would you go from here to there?
[28:02.47]If I was dying, wouldn't you want to go on the easiest path?
[28:07.93]I'm bleeding to death!
[28:09.69]I might as well go and touch each wall!
[28:13.72]You go to the path of the least resistance, man.
[28:20.08]Look, anything but over here to turn the light on, right?
[28:23.98]Okay, that's smart.
[28:24.80]And then you get... Why are you doing all this?
[28:30.81]Alright, this guy's gonna get up.
[28:31.99]This thing explodes, I guarantee it.
[28:33.27]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[28:37.28]Who's that?
[28:41.39]Alright, I thought I just, I thought I just did that to somebody.
[28:44.49]Okay, I got full, how do I do the, uh, zoom vending?
[28:47.97]Alright, that's how you do zoom vending.
[28:49.71]Now what do we got on the monitor just here?
[28:57.82]Okay.
[29:00.52]I, I think this is showing me stuff from the past.
[29:06.60]Oh, this is happening right now.
[29:09.74]Huh?
[29:15.07]Okay, well, that was weird.
[29:17.19]That guy turned around very quick.
[29:22.42]Anybody on this phone?
[29:25.94]No.
[29:29.70]So, I think now I can go this way.
[29:31.99]Something's dripping up there.
[29:35.57]What is it?
[29:37.89]Yeah, I knew it.
[29:38.63]It's the camera.
[29:40.77]Something's going to jump out of here.
[29:47.07]Not missing anything, right?
[29:48.43]What about this weird radio?
[29:49.45]No, we're good.
[29:53.19]This game is awesome.
[29:54.11]It seems like it's pretty good.
[29:56.01]I am enjoying this so far.
[29:58.95]Okay, so now I have to go.
[30:03.65]Does light matter in this game?
[30:06.56]Light doesn't matter, right?
[30:08.76]Like, I'm not going to show myself, am I?
[30:12.02]Wait, I'm not ready for this.
[30:12.78]I'm going to go back to where the chair was.
[30:20.59]I think I can turn that off now.
[30:22.71]Right?
[30:24.19]At least theoretically.
[30:27.30]So now if I turn this down... That's both of them.
[30:33.80]No.
[30:35.50]I guess it doesn't matter.
[30:40.12]Later parts of the game are literally pitch black.
[30:44.84]So darkness actually is... I need to use it to my advantage.
[30:51.07]I will keep that in mind.
[30:51.99]I have a lot of bullets.
[30:52.71]Alright, here we go.
[30:54.55]Is there a crouch?
[30:56.59]It's a first person mode.
[31:02.35]This is probably going to be very useful.
[31:10.24]Now I can use it and I can actually aim good.
[31:18.26]Let's get in here.
[31:20.40]That's locked.
[31:21.66]Oh, okay.
[31:23.82]Walk along.
[31:24.58]Alright, gotta use those FPS skills.
[31:25.64]Here we go.
[31:26.18]Wait, he's in front of me.
[31:28.72]He was in front of me.
[31:29.46]I thought he was behind me.
[31:32.34]No, fuck the first person.
[31:33.50]I can't tell if he's behind me or not.
[31:34.72]Where is he?
[31:35.00]On the ceiling?
[31:37.07]Okay, he's over there.
[31:39.15]First person!
[31:42.95]Got it.
[31:44.17]Wait!
[31:44.63]Okay, I took the head off.
[31:46.41]Doesn't even matter.
[31:53.54]Even if they lose their heads, it doesn't matter.
[31:58.48]I thought in every video game, if you blow their head off, they lose.
[32:02.73]Apparently, that's not the case in this one.
[32:05.55]Hey!
[32:08.05]Hey, Ricky!
[32:12.57]You don't think I can jump over that shock?
[32:16.11]Hey!
[32:17.13]Hey!
[32:19.09]Is that your teddy?
[32:21.35]Fuck your childhood!
[32:22.57]-2.
[32:23.31]Oh, come on.
[32:24.45]Give me a minus.
[32:26.47]That's the dentist office.
[32:48.33]Nothing scary.
[32:49.01]Alright, I gotta, like, pull this out and, like, block the door, right?
[32:52.65]If I were a video game, that's what I would, like, that's what I would have to do.
[32:56.61]I'd pull this, wedge it in between this door, right?
[33:04.11]Or would I?
[33:05.95]What would I do if I were a video.
[33:08.39]I'm not sure.
[33:09.05]Let's just get that out of the way.
[33:11.05]I can't do anything with that.
[33:12.73]This doesn't open.
[33:14.23]Nope.
[33:14.53]Okay.
[33:14.89]So, this door closes, though.
[33:17.84]Did I have it right that first time?
[33:19.07]Was I correct on my assessment?
[33:22.83]I believe I was correct in my assessment.
[33:27.51]So I have to wedge this guard.
[33:29.83]I was right the whole time.
[33:30.51]Oh, come on.
[33:47.13]Come on, come on!
[33:48.29]Get in the first person mode so you can actually shoot things.
[33:54.16]What is, wait!
[33:55.30]Oh, I went into the metal detector.
[33:59.94]Reload.
[34:02.50]Alright, let's just make him come.
[34:03.94]This is a bad idea.
[34:09.79]He just killed the other one.
[34:15.41]Stop it!
[34:15.91]Stop doing that!
[34:19.55]You dead?
[34:25.88]Are they both dead?
[34:26.80]I don't understand this.
[34:31.32]Let them fight.
[34:32.02]I mean, I kind of did for a second.
[34:33.74]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing.
[34:37.11]Get this wedged in there.
[34:44.63]Now, can I push this closer?
[34:47.98]No, that's fine.
[34:48.82]Can I walk through this?
[34:51.88]I'm kind of stuck.
[34:55.64]No, that's not going to work.
[35:02.36]I can't wedge through this.
[35:05.40]I can't pull it.
[35:10.66]Is that going to do it?
[35:11.32]I don't think that's going to do it.
[35:13.97]That's not gonna do it.
[35:23.76]Wait, what's wrong?
[35:24.84]What do you mean?
[35:27.46]Why do I have a tiny brain?
[35:28.60]It doesn't look like it's gonna do it.
[35:32.95]Alright, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[35:34.03]Those of you that are saying that I'm an idiot, like, let me show you something here.
[35:37.73]That, like, that doesn.
[35:39.07]That doesn't look like it's gonna do it.
[35:40.45]Like, I mean, okay, the bottom here, but like...
[35:43.17]I don't know.
[35:43.53]I didn't know where to spot it.
[35:45.14]I knew what to do.
[35:47.44]I can't pull it.
[35:49.14]Look.
[35:50.38]I can't move it in that direction.
[35:53.32]I can't go this way or that way.
[35:55.02]I can only move it one direction.
[35:57.23]I can only go back and forwards.
[36:01.45]Listen.
[36:01.71]Everybody just quiet down.
[36:02.37]Quiet down for a minute.
[36:03.69]So I can get the program here started.
[36:09.82]We're in.
[36:16.03]That was just like Charlie Sheen.
[36:18.97]Hello?
[36:20.17]Can anybody hear me?
[36:22.13]What's going on?
[36:24.83]Hello?
[36:25.32]Let me out!
[36:28.16]What is it?
[36:28.66]It wants me to kill him?
[36:29.78]Kill him?
[36:31.18]No, we're not doing the bad guy scenario.
[36:32.96]We're doing good guy.
[36:45.34]Which one of you fuckers thought of this?
[36:47.58]That really is like Charlie Sheen.
[36:49.14]Which one of you fuckers thought of this?
[36:50.38]I may be a New Jack, but you think I was born yesterday?
[36:53.56]I'm not scared.
[36:54.28]I know this thing was decommissioned in the 80s.
[36:57.63]They will if the door's shut to everything.
[36:59.71]No way it can hurt me.
[37:01.45]How'd you guys get me in here anyway?
[37:03.59]I'll probably end up killing him anyways.
[37:04.81]No, I'm not going to kill him.
[37:05.69]I'm a monster.
[37:06.17]Anyone hear me?
[37:08.93]It sounds like it was Seth Rogen.
[37:15.24]That is like Seth Rogen Charlie.
[37:16.94]Yeah!
[37:18.98]Wait, he's gonna go kill him.
[37:19.82]He's gonna go run after him and kill him, isn't he?
[37:32.49]It's hard to see.
[37:33.35]God damn it.
[37:40.40]I shouldn't even be using the gun.
[37:48.31]I need like a better weapon Alright, we're good Come on, can anyone let me out of here?
[38:00.76]Hey!
[38:01.58]Let's make another movie about smoking weed!
[38:03.70]What?
[38:07.83]How do I let him out?
[38:08.91]Let him out!
[38:09.35]Let him out!
[38:10.37]Let him out!
[38:11.77]Let him out!
[38:13.77]Let him out!
[38:24.99]Where?
[38:26.63]Open the door.
[38:27.81]How do I open the door?
[38:29.24]Can you hear me?
[38:30.42]I can't shut the gas up.
[38:31.78]Wait, do I have to run back?
[38:32.86]Oh, wait a minute.
[38:39.09]Fuck you.
[38:40.43]Where's the gas valve?
[38:52.15]Wait, is this open?
[38:53.55]This is hurting me.
[38:54.47]That's hurting me.
[38:55.73]Oh my fucking god.
[38:59.31]I gotta get out of this room.
[39:03.70]Get out of the room!
[39:04.58]Oh my fucking god.
[39:06.50]Get out of the room!
[39:11.36]They won't leave you alone until you do it.
[39:19.51]What?
[39:21.09]Why am I asking like he can hear me?
[39:23.71]Let's wrap around down here.
[39:25.97]Ooh, a bunch of shit.
[39:28.13]Look at all the artifacting I'm getting.
[39:32.53]My, like, rat is starting to have a problem.
[39:34.50]It's having a problem!
[39:36.68]So am I, I guess.
[39:46.58]I feel like it's better if I do this.
[39:50.28]Nope, no it ain't.
[39:57.85]The knife is better than the gun.
[39:59.79]It really is.
[40:03.33]That was a scripted event, guys.
[40:04.69]I wasn't supposed to win.
[40:09.97]Oh shit.
[40:21.10]Flash at batteries.
[40:21.84]Tommy gun!
[40:22.52]There we go.
[40:25.70]Where do I get a Tommy gun?
[40:29.47]I would like to have that.
[40:30.61]Absolutely.
[40:33.91]I gotta turn down the music.
[40:35.55]Why is it too loud?
[40:38.11]How's that?
[40:38.97]Hold it right there.
[40:46.57]Is that better?
[40:48.83]Environment effects.
[40:49.75]Turn those on.
[40:51.45]Oh god, hold on.
[40:52.60]Turn the subtitles on too.
[40:58.36]I've missed like every bit.
[40:59.68]Here's why I've been missing bits because like alt tabbing like is very dangerous with these old games.
[41:07.96]If I like alt tab and I have to go over and scroll down it might actually break the game so I apologize that I'm missing bits but somebody just gave $50 so I gotta look over here and see what that was.
[41:20.01]And let's take a minute.
[41:20.89]Let me let go through these.
[41:22.23]Let's take a minute.
[41:23.11]We can go for a little while.
[41:23.99]Just bear with me for like two minutes.
[41:26.93]Snarksy's
[41:29.03]Snark sees or snarks ease snark says Snarks thanks for the 50 bucks dude $50 love you Jerma Well, thank you.

[41:56.48]No, none of this badness.
[41:57.72]None of this bad stuff.
[41:58.60]I

[44:30.96]Should I go to TwitchCon next year just for you?
[44:33.46]Well, that depends on how much you care about Twitch.
[44:37.24]Because I'll tell you right now, if you don't care that much about Twitch, going to TwitchCon, you're going to run out of shit to do real quick.
[44:46.83]If you walk around the show floor, you'll see the show floor.
[44:50.25]But you really, you need to be like super, super into Twitch to like go to TwitchCon, I would say.
[44:56.01]Because if you don't care about Twitch, then you kind of just like, alright, there's streamers here.
[45:02.63]And that's it.
[45:04.25]Okay.
[45:05.59]What else we got?
[45:07.33]So it's fun if you're like really into it, for sure.

[45:49.90]Thank you, everybody.
[45:51.38]Much appreciated.
[45:53.35]I did hang out with Kryken at TwitchCon.
[45:55.73]He's a swell guy.
[45:57.57]And so are the rest of those dudes.
[46:00.43]There was like four or five people that I met at TwitchCon.
[46:05.81]But yes.
[46:07.83]We went in a couple of haunted houses.
[46:09.51]Can't put it off forever.
[46:11.45]This place is stronger than you.
[46:14.20]Can I pull this off like the Incredible Hulk?
[46:17.68]No.
[46:18.22]What about this one?
[46:19.66]I'm going to be able to do that to one of these.
[46:25.34]125 guns.
[46:27.08]Let's go into first person mode for this one.
[46:28.67]Show me why you're in here.
[46:29.93]I want to know all about you.
[46:31.63]Why is everybody Charlie Sheen?
[46:46.65]What is holding that flashlight on his chest?
[46:50.31]Did he like duct tape the flashlight to his body?
[46:52.97]What is it, like an iPhone clip on there that he slid on his shirt?
[47:01.64]Death is our stock and trade here at Abbott.
[47:03.62]The final solution...
[47:07.12]The voice does not match this character.
[47:10.22]Oh no!
[47:10.80]Oh, who's tall?
[47:11.26]Is that the ghost that was just talking?
[47:38.87]same place.
[47:40.65]Well, well, well.
[47:42.07]Look what we have here.
[47:43.45]How long I have been waiting to encounter such a fascinating weapon.
[47:48.80]My understanding is you've had periodic blackouts since... When was it?
[47:52.98]Ah, yes.
[47:53.58]Oh, no.
[47:53.96]It's Doctor 30s.
[47:55.08]Ever wonder what happened?
[47:57.47]He traveled all the way into the 30s to get here.
[47:59.43]Would you say you have visions of bloodshed?
[48:03.03]Yes.
[48:03.65]Surely there is bloodshed.
[48:06.73]You've seen death, right?
[48:08.31]I read about your life, you sick bastard.
[48:10.34]What a shame.
[48:11.44]I never got to snuff a woman.
[48:14.80]Did you really do it?
[48:16.14]Because we get innocent guys in here.
[48:18.38]Sure, innocent till presumed guilty.
[48:21.70]Human-powered prison.
[48:22.89]It doesn't affect me doing my job, though.
[48:25.03]Above all else, I'm a professional.
[48:30.82]Nothing compares to the deep satisfaction of terminating a human life.
[48:34.94]This is like a relaxation tape.
[48:36.84]You already know that.
[48:38.46]Yeah, can you turn off the relaxation audio tape?
[48:42.99]I need to kill a monster.
[48:45.15]You had a wife, right?
[48:46.21]Fucking hypnotism tape.
[48:47.79]How far would you go to make sure she stayed yours?
[48:51.03]You get mad, you feel you could kill a man, rip him apart with your bare hands.
[48:56.29]The chain after is on the fly.
[49:00.80]Okay, I'll try.
[49:07.90]Come on, get down.
[49:10.79]Come on.
[49:11.27]I was trying to do like an overhead swing.
[49:14.59]Land!
[49:14.91]Will you land?
[49:17.69]Oh, you dick.
[49:27.49]Watch it.
[49:30.49]Oh, he's gonna do the dive.
[49:31.27]He's gonna do the M-Bison.
[49:32.39]Where are you?
[49:35.93]Don't.
[49:39.80]Jesus.
[49:40.90]Rectangle gun.
[49:47.30]I can make you well.
[49:48.74]I can give you control if you really want it.
[49:51.76]But first, you've got to show me.
[49:54.72]Come on now.
[49:55.84]Give it a try for me, won't you?
[49:57.26]What do you want me to do?
[49:58.18]Can't put it off forever.
[49:59.96]This place is full of enemies.
[50:05.20]Insanity meter is full.
[50:06.96]Front seat.
[50:07.86]Insanity meter.
[50:10.78]They won't leave you alone until you do it.
[50:13.18]How do I gain insanity?
[50:14.76]I don't understand.
[50:22.50]to do.
[50:39.61]Alright, I think I just have to keep... Okay.
[50:46.76]I just keep killing people.
[50:50.56]You get it when you start screaming.
[50:55.14]Come on, get this kill.
[50:56.46]I need to gain my insanity meter.
[50:58.52]What the... Honestly, the guns don't get hurt anymore.
[51:00.60]No wonder they give you so many bullets.
[51:09.68]I transformed as well as possible.
[51:13.22]I wish they would all stop talking.
[51:14.88]Okay, here we go.
[51:15.84]Let's do it.
[51:16.52]Let's transform.
[51:20.72]What?
[51:21.18]It just became a completely different game.
[51:41.09]What?
[51:44.23]You actually do turn into- I made the Incredible Hulk joke like fucking eight seconds ago, and you actually turn into one.
[51:54.68]Alright, so I have to transform back before I lose in Sam.
[51:58.04]Okay.
[51:59.94]Killer croc.
[52:11.38]We'll need to discuss this further in our next session.
[52:16.52]Alright.
[52:17.41]Flare.
[52:17.85]I got flares now.
[52:21.37]What is that?
[52:21.73]Of course it's a rat.
[52:24.77]Oh, I feel bad.
[52:29.19]Fuck, I pressed the wrong button.
[52:33.05]He just wanted to eat that dead guy.
[52:35.41]I ruined everything.
[52:36.53]And then I accidentally took another healing potion.
[52:47.25]I hear somebody running.
[52:48.17]Where are they running from?
[52:49.09]I don't know.
[52:51.41]Down over in the nitro?
[52:54.34]I don't know.
[52:54.70]What does this do?
[52:57.60]I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[53:00.32]We have to go down here.
[53:05.48]During crank angles.
[53:08.38]Wow, man.
[53:09.84]Use S to rotate.
[53:10.90]You know what I was saying.
[53:12.94]You know?
[53:19.52]Looks like a Resident Evil 4.
[53:34.49]What?
[53:36.03]No, don't let him Dark Souls me.
[53:38.05]Come on, do something, rat.
[53:46.85]Oh, okay, you're dead.
[53:52.40]I was thinking he was going to explore.
[53:54.20]Oh, come on.
[53:56.63]Alright, you can't hit him in the head there.
[53:58.43]You just can't.
[53:59.03]I'm going to unload on him.
[54:00.25]They're running away like the spiders they are.
[54:07.01]Let's go for a chest shot.
[54:10.27]That's how you do it.
[54:12.83]That's the reliable way to do it.
[54:14.05]I just picked up like every item.
[54:22.08]Tommy gun exists.
[54:25.21]Holy shit.
[54:25.91]Okay.
[54:26.13]You died.
[54:27.29]Wow.
[54:27.51]That's a lot.
[54:30.11]What is this?
[54:48.93]Let's get 48 ammo.
[54:49.93]Did I just pick up all the ammo that was inside of his fucking body?
[54:53.13]I think that's what just happened.
[54:55.81]I shot that guy 48 times and just went through his body, scavenged, and took them out.
[55:00.28]I'm okay with that.
[55:03.56]Let's open up some... Oh, God.
[55:05.62]1, 3, 6.
[55:07.68]What is all this nonsense?
[55:13.26]Uh... Huh?
[55:15.39]What the hell did I just do?
[55:20.52]Reusable cartridges.
[55:23.05]Can we Fonz this?
[55:24.71]I don't think we can Fonz any of this stuff.
[55:26.77]Use space to climb.
[55:27.75]I guess I can.
[55:33.47]We're just going straight up.
[55:34.29]This game's not even hard.
[55:38.84]There's not even loot boxes, I know, right?
[55:41.76]Suck my cock, you fucking monstrosity!
[55:44.60]Who's that?
[55:45.00]I know what's coming.
[55:55.49]Oh no, it's just like a time crisis.
[55:57.95]I have to save the civilian before the zombie gets there.
[56:00.09]Well, I didn't do it.
[56:04.81]I just lost minus one HP.
[56:07.05]I lost a life.
[56:17.52]Is this like the first boss?
[56:22.12]Okay, he's blind.
[56:23.50]Turn that flashlight off.
[56:28.30]Turn the flashlight off.
[56:31.53]Turn the flashlight off, he can't see.
[56:41.05]I guess he can see.
[56:43.11]Can he see?
[56:46.21]Yes, he can.
[56:47.86]Yes, yes he did.
[56:57.66]I have no health either.
[57:07.57]What a fucking mess.
[57:10.93]Oh my god.
[57:12.93]I need healing.
[57:14.07]Oh, there he is.
[57:14.85]There's the big guy.
[57:15.67]There's the scary guy.
[57:16.49]Can I go in here?
[57:17.13]Oh, I'm dead.
[57:19.02]I'm so dead here.
[57:25.82]What is in this door?
[57:26.88]Come on, somebody, NPC?
[57:29.44]Wait, I can turn into the hole.
[57:32.72]Do it!
[57:35.04]What are you doing?
[57:35.75]Why are you looking at a photo?
[57:37.57]What the fuck?
[57:50.90]Suck my cock, you fucking monstrosity!
[57:54.40]Oh, God.
[57:55.06]Okay, well, we tried.
[57:57.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:00.86]Let's make sure all of this shit's reloaded.
[58:03.90]I have to watch this again.
[58:06.27]No, I don't.
[58:06.77]Okay, let's go.
[58:08.27]Does he hit me every time?
[58:13.41]I have to turn into the monster to kill this guy.
[58:18.93]Mousepad 2 to throw grenades.
[58:24.72]That's not a grenade.
[58:27.62]What am I throwing?
[58:30.26]What did I just throw?
[58:30.91]Flashbang grenades.
[58:35.01]I would like to select them.
[58:35.79]How do I select them?
[58:38.29]How do I select the flashbangs?
[58:40.84]I have to blind this guy.
[58:54.38]either.
[58:56.94]Yes, he can.
[58:57.72]Get out of the way, please.
[59:03.89]Probably has its own vine.
[59:05.51]Well, what the hell even?
[59:12.34]Somebody's just sprinting over there.
[59:18.90]I have to kill one of these guys and then turn into the psycho.
[59:27.74]He's turning off the lights.
[59:29.36]Might be the same.
[59:30.44]Okay, do it!
[59:31.51]Alright, where is he?
[59:36.53]Where's my flashlight?
[59:37.23]Let's get this motherfucker.
[59:53.56]well okay that he was not making that noise okay that was interesting so what is making what are you making this like whipping sound something is very very loud can I pick up the saw what about the hammer I hear somebody else running oh come on there's another one well shouldn't have turned that off
[60:22.74]I gotta run.
[60:24.82]Oh god damn it.
[60:27.64]Oh god damn it.
[60:29.27]Oh god damn- What exploded?
[60:36.77]What exploded?
[60:40.68]No, I'm not going in there yet.
[60:46.18]I need healing.
[60:48.47]I came in here without any health.
[60:52.15]I got batteries, cool.
[60:53.61]Use mouse or numpad plus.
[61:19.80]I don't think I can dodge this, but I wonder if I can just push him up.
[61:23.63]Alright, these guys aren't that scary.
[61:25.59]You just have to blow them, you gotta blow them away.
[61:28.89]Okay, I'm fine.
[61:30.79]Now I have the Insanity, if I need to use it on the other one, I will.
[61:33.01]Turn the lights back on.
[61:38.33]This guy didn't have anything, right?
[61:42.57]I got full ammo.
[61:44.27]Save is right here.
[61:44.87]So I don't have to do that shit again.
[61:53.18]You just gotta blow them.
[61:54.16]Alright, let's look at the options.
[61:57.54]What's like the select grenade type?
[62:03.84]I think the game crashed.
[62:04.98]It did.
[62:06.08]No, the game just crashed.
[62:07.68]So, it's a good thing I just saved it right fucking there.
[62:10.49]Oh, no, there we go.
[62:16.43]Somebody just gave a hundred dollars.
[62:20.11]There's a $100 bitch donation here.
[62:25.21]From... Dime... From Dime In Your Ear.
[62:31.36]Or Dime... Dime In Your Rear.
[62:35.32]Whatever that means.
[62:36.12]I don't know.
[62:36.70]Thank you, Dime In The Ear, for the $100.
[62:38.84]And it says... Thank you, Dime.
[62:45.26]Your stream was the first thing that made me laugh after my father's death eight months ago.
[62:49.72]You have no idea how much it meant to me to be able to laugh again after that kind of an ordeal.
[62:54.05]Thank you.
[62:55.97]Well, that's... I'm so sorry to hear that, man.
[63:03.15]Any condolences I can give you, I'm so sorry to hear that.
[63:07.35]But if you can get any ounce of happiness from watching this stream, then that makes me fucking happy.
[63:13.35]It really does.
[63:15.65]So, keep your chin up, dude.
[63:19.27]Much love.
[63:21.17]It's probably not fucking easy what you're dealing with.
[63:25.62]But thank you so much for the $100.
[63:26.72]Appreciate it.
[63:34.20]So let's... What am I doing here?
[63:41.11]Yeah, and there's plenty of people in this chat.
[63:42.69]And if you go to the Discord too, I highly recommend it.
[63:46.55]There's plenty of people to talk to.
[63:49.23]If you're looking to talk to people, too.
[63:50.69]Just anybody in the community.
[63:52.99]Whatever you're going through.
[63:53.91]Anything that's happening.
[63:55.55]I feel like we have a pretty good, well-intended community here.
[64:02.75]By all means, guys.
[64:06.96]But stay strong.
[64:08.34]Because that's a terrible fucking thing to deal with.
[64:15.24]You got banned from the Discord for spamming eggplants.
[64:18.56]Well, maybe you shouldn't do that.
[64:24.38]Anywho, also thank you to Aunt Ryda.
[64:27.68]Aunt Rita, again, for the one dollar.
[64:29.30]Have another dollar, baby.
[64:30.20]Well, thank you.
[64:33.62]Swiggity, thank you for the two bucks.
[64:35.94]You should watch the film Ben on stream.
[64:39.84]What do you mean the film Ben?
[64:43.00]I don't know what that is, but thank you.
[64:46.30]Let's keep going.
[64:46.96]So what's the... You don't remember anyone spamming eggplants?
[64:53.20]I have no idea.
[64:56.07]How do I go up or down?
[64:58.41]Fire, throw.
[65:00.61]Use.
[65:01.51]First person health is tab.
[65:04.35]See, reload, flashlight, flare.
[65:07.28]Wait, there's a roll.
[65:08.76]Why didn't it tell me this?
[65:10.70]Roll left and roll right.
[65:14.71]So I think it's just... Okay, it's eight.
[65:16.19]I just have to press eight.
[65:18.59]There's a lot of weapons in this game.
[65:19.79]Holy shit.
[65:22.19]So wait, you tell me there's a... Well, that changes everything.
[65:30.02]That makes this game so much more... Why didn't it tell me I had that?
[65:33.84]And now I gotta pee.
[65:36.80]Give me one second, guys.
[65:37.76]I have to pee.
[65:38.24]I'm not going to change the BRB screen, or I'm not going to mute the mic either.
[65:41.57]because I don't want to crash the game.
[65:43.15]So I'll be right back.
[65:44.83]Take a piss.
[65:46.19]Grab a snack.
[65:47.33]I shall return here in a second.
[67:13.83]I'm back.
[67:16.22]It's hot in this room, holy goodness.
[67:18.62]I'm gonna turn this off now.
[67:25.32]Mac and cheese is done.
[67:26.24]That was a quick pee, yeah.
[67:32.57]And you're gonna get another two or three of those this ring because that's just what I do.
[67:36.87]I just pee.
[67:40.05]Okay, uh, resume.
[67:42.57]So, uh, there's another guy that I have to get rid of.
[67:46.44]There's some other guy.
[67:47.76]Okay, can I break these doors down if I'm playing as the Incredible Hulk?
[67:52.42]I think I can.
[67:54.96]I think I'm just gonna get rid of all these guys.
[68:04.67]There's another one down here.
[68:05.91]Where is he?
[68:07.94]Where is he?
[68:15.98]Where is he?
[68:19.74]Where is he?
[68:20.43]Where is he?
[68:23.15]Where is he?
[68:23.89]Where is he?
[68:24.41]Where is he?
[68:24.81]Where is he?
[68:37.49]I feel like I shouldn't open the door looking like this.
[68:39.65]I'm going to scare him.
[68:42.47]Alright.
[68:51.13]Lower the volume.
[68:52.16]Is the volume too loud still?
[68:53.24]Hold it right there.
[68:56.44]Hold it right there.
[68:57.32]How's that?
[68:59.24]Better?
[69:02.70]You can barely hear me.
[69:03.86]Wait, did I turn?
[69:04.52]I must have done it.
[69:07.60]Yeah, the stupid thing.
[69:09.78]Okay, there we go.
[69:10.56]No, hold on.
[69:10.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:20.65]There.
[69:21.03]I moved the mic a little closer.
[69:22.57]I have trouble with this microphone sometimes.
[69:26.94]Sometimes.
[69:28.22]It causes issues.
[69:31.22]So should I blow the door?
[69:38.91]Alright, let's get in.
[69:40.82]Daddy, I can't see.
[69:43.30]Where are you?
[69:44.90]Turn on the lights.
[69:51.60]No, I don't want to see it.
[69:53.80]No.
[69:54.58]Let's go.
[69:54.94]What?
[69:55.30]Daddy, no.
[70:01.61]Okay, let me I'm gonna go over something here.
[70:03.01]I'm gonna go it's called anime.
[70:04.11]I'm gonna go over anime here We're gonna talk about anime.
[70:06.59]We're gonna go for very very bluntly anime animated Japanese anime, okay?
[70:11.83]It's not just anime.
[70:12.77]It's like every it's like every cartoon, but not every cartoon some cartoons predominantly talking about anime so when when when I got an older wouldn't when a woman is doing like a small boys voice and
[70:28.48]You know what I'm talking about?
[70:30.64]The suspension of disbelief just goes out the window for me.
[70:36.51]And I know why you do it.
[70:38.39]I know because it's hard to get a fucking nine-year-old to be an actor.
[70:42.95]It's hard.
[70:43.39]I know.
[70:43.73]I understand.
[70:49.74]But I can see it from a mile away.
[70:57.05]I can get in there.
[71:01.45]There's also a lot of Western cards.
[71:02.55]Yeah, I do.
[71:07.02]Come on, go down!
[71:17.65]Go down!
[71:19.87]Oh god, dammit.
[71:22.05]I'm not one of those fucking idiots.
[71:32.42]I thought I could dodge roll, right?
[71:35.63]Dodge roll didn't do anything.
[71:38.61]I clearly dodge rolled the first one.
[71:40.05]You guys know that.
[71:40.61]You saw it.
[71:44.57]Holy shit.
[71:48.00]It doesn't do anything.
[71:48.88]It doesn't do anything.
[71:51.78]What?
[71:52.18]Oh god.
[72:03.74]When in doubt, fucking burger boy technique.
[72:10.32]Whoa!
[72:17.10]Land.
[72:18.80]Land!
[72:19.92]OK, let's break some doors.
[72:24.23]I can't break that door.
[72:26.47]Anything else?
[72:30.69]OK, I think we're good.
[72:36.53]Can't dodge bullets.
[72:38.93]Well, I mean, dodging bullets is one thing, but... I mean... There's an army.
[72:49.70]If this was clearly a Dark Souls game, I would have been able to dodge those bullets.
[72:54.14]Wait, let's go on this one first.
[72:56.96]Anything gonna miss something here?
[73:01.62]This whole game looks like a remix.
[73:04.12]It's actually pretty good.
[73:09.84]Remember, this game came out a long time ago.
[73:18.02]This is absolutely going to be the best game we play all week.
[73:22.73]I got like a bunch of campy horror games.
[73:26.65]This is definitely the best one we're going to play without a shred of doubt.
[73:32.53]That guy's dead.
[73:33.11]That guy's dead.
[73:34.10]You're all dead.
[73:38.11]Looks like a bloody trap land level after like three hours.
[73:40.66]Alright.
[73:43.22]Did I miss anything else?
[73:44.96]I don't think I did.
[73:45.80]Let's just... Wait, I can turn the lever in here, right?
[73:49.82]Yeah, I can turn that weird lever.
[73:52.94]What is this?
[73:53.50]Okay.
[73:55.77]I just want to make sure I don't miss any devices.
[73:57.79]I don't want to miss any ammo because it's so precious in this game.
[74:06.33]Where was that lever?
[74:07.45]It's right there.
[74:10.97]Looks like it's opening that.
[74:14.97]What the hell is that doing?
[74:20.58]Okay, well that's open.
[74:21.46]Homie gun.
[74:21.70]I am a foe.
[74:22.22]So I was like an ex-military guy or something.
[74:44.21]I'm waiting for someone to be on that phone.
[74:45.55]Can I, like, prank call somebody?
[74:46.80]Did I... I missed the Tommy gun, wherever that is.
[74:49.92]I have full ammo for the Tommy gun.
[74:51.76]This guy can't be attacked.
[74:59.72]That's very clear as day.
[75:14.90]It is a freaking demon.
[75:17.53]Oh.
[75:18.35]Wow, that's a lot.
[75:23.87]They're all scripted.
[75:24.63]They're not even part of the actual game environment.
[75:28.07]They were just game environments.
[75:33.45]Not even real.
[75:34.11]I thought that was a...
[75:45.52]Big green box.
[75:47.34]Why?
[75:48.24]What?
[75:50.60]Why?
[75:51.32]Wait, hold on.
[75:52.32]How far back were we?
[75:54.56]What?
[75:55.06]Wait, how far back was that?
[75:56.30]Do I reload the save?
[75:57.30]Huh?
[76:01.93]Why?
[76:02.29]Oh my god.
[76:06.45]This is so fun.
[76:10.15]I have a save to load.
[76:11.11]I gotta load the next save, right?
[76:12.44]Load game.
[76:14.81]I'm not losing my fucking mind here, right?
[76:16.79]This is where I should be.
[76:19.65]Oh my fucking god.
[76:20.79]It said TNT.
[76:30.50]I don't remember.
[76:31.02]Is this even further back than where I am now?
[76:35.46]No, I'm just gonna go full beast mode here.
[76:39.01]Beast mode and just gonna run through everything.
[76:41.75]So forget about this guy.
[76:42.73]Forget about this guy.
[76:43.54]Just walk.
[76:44.44]Keep going.
[76:44.86]Alright.
[76:46.00]Look.
[76:46.60]Just run.
[76:47.20]Open everything.
[76:55.15]Just spam kill everybody.
[76:57.79]Get dead.
[76:59.49]Next.
[76:59.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[77:01.11]Dad.
[77:01.37]Dad.
[77:01.53]Open the door.
[77:03.25]Yep.
[77:04.05]Here I am.
[77:08.06]I don't want to see it either.
[77:09.38]I'd like to skip it.
[77:12.65]Open it.
[77:13.03]Open the door.
[77:13.47]I can't just open the door like a fucking human.
[77:21.32]Get in here.
[77:31.06]Save it here.
[77:32.58]Save.
[77:32.86]Make sure I save everything.
[77:33.96]What's the super save?
[77:34.90]The quick save?
[77:35.50]The good save?
[77:36.11]The fast save?
[77:36.73]The faster save?
[77:37.59]The fast save?
[77:45.15]Go.
[77:48.53]You're open.
[77:48.91]And then the guy that goes, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[77:55.93]There's a big guy in here.
[77:58.21]Right?
[77:58.89]There's a couple of people in here that I need to get rid of.
[78:00.35]And I remember I went the wrong fucking way.
[78:10.05]I don't remember.
[78:13.15]Wait, didn't we just do this?
[78:14.53]Dad, no.
[78:15.21]And I walked through here.
[78:16.05]Dad went through the door.
[78:16.93]Dad's going to open up.
[78:18.48]Wait, I'm in like a fucking groundhog day.
[78:20.46]What happened there?
[78:24.52]I went through here.
[78:26.62]Okay, now this is where the lickers are.
[78:30.26]They go click with click.
[78:31.98]Here it comes.
[78:34.06]And, bingo.
[78:40.28]Play it just like Dark Souls.
[78:43.27]Oh, shit.
[78:44.51]Actually, movement pretty good.
[78:55.07]Movement's pretty good, guys.
[78:57.00]I highly recommend this game on GOG.com.
[79:11.45]Can I blow something up?
[79:21.82]I went like Super Saiyan here before.
[79:27.64]Damn it, that's so annoying.
[79:29.04]You know, it also doesn't help that I'm playing this game in like a fucking tiny window.
[79:39.25]Burger Boy technique, what the fuck am I doing?
[79:47.50]I'm so fucked.
[79:48.35]I'm dead.
[79:59.67]I went like crazy about here.
[80:00.93]Blow this up.
[80:02.61]No, no, I wanted to blow it up when I was ready.
[80:18.32]Don't don't fuck it up this time.
[80:20.06]It's just I just I least I'm here I Have to get I have to go through and have it explode is what has to happen because like yeah I get like eight people collapse.
[80:30.98]I almost just got killed by that Okay, come on up Where are you?
[80:39.10]I really should go in first person.
[80:40.51]No, I shouldn't.
[80:41.07]What a dumb idea.
[80:41.97]Just wait for them to come over here and then have them explode it.
[80:44.75]There you go.
[80:45.07]Ready?
[80:45.79]First person for this.
[80:47.15]One.
[80:47.93]Two.
[80:51.57]Fuck on.
[80:53.98]Oh, my God.
[80:54.72]What a fucking... Alright.
[80:55.88]Hey, come on.
[80:56.20]Dad's over here.
[80:59.22]I can't even see it.
[81:00.36]I got... I'm dead again.
[81:15.99]What the fuck?
[81:17.85]Let go of this!
[81:18.99]Put it down!
[81:27.22]I had it done the first time, and I've knifed a TNT box.
[81:30.30]Fucking joke.
[81:31.68]Speaking of knives... It's so much easier to do that.
[81:41.67]I just have to get them around the corner.
[81:43.83]Don't blow that up!
[81:46.64]See, he's going to blow it up, and I'm going to be... The gun does not do even a tenth of the damage of the knife.
[82:05.56]God damn it.
[82:08.06]I'm just training them all back here.
[82:11.46]Remember when we were back here?
[82:23.72]Die!
[82:24.17]I didn't even shoot him and he died.
[82:48.87]I'm confused about how a lot of this shit works.
[82:52.38]That guy died before I shot him again.
[82:56.44]It follows.
[82:57.34]Alright, now I'm gonna save it.
[83:02.88]Save it again where the first wave is dead.
[83:06.42]Save.
[83:08.38]We good.
[83:11.56]Now, resume.
[83:15.94]Resume game.
[83:18.14]Follow through here.
[83:18.92]Go through the daddy door.
[83:19.82]I think I'm being followed from behind.
[83:23.12]Yeah, I am.
[83:30.97]We are now good to go.
[83:32.01]I just need to get some more health.
[83:34.21]Ammo is everywhere.
[83:34.97]Health is not.
[83:36.89]Although I do have psycho mode.
[83:40.59]Batteries.
[83:41.39]Psycho mode.
[83:43.20]I'm ready to go.
[83:44.26]Let's get back to where we were.
[83:48.42]If I need to use Psycho Mode, I would.
[83:51.92]I could dodge that.
[83:54.15]But I just didn't.
[83:57.35]Happy Halloween, by the way.
[83:58.25]If you're watching this stream and it's Halloween where you are.
[84:00.69]I don't know how time zones work, but happy Halloween.
[84:06.67]Okay.
[84:12.06]The reason why that happened last time, guys, is because look at these green boxes.
[84:18.31]These don't say TNT on them.
[84:20.31]They're just U.S.
[84:21.51]Army boxes.
[84:24.05]So the TNT boxes also look exactly the same.
[84:26.51]They're just bigger.
[84:28.09]I thought it was a big Army box.
[84:38.17]Let's go.
[84:38.47]Yeah, it's the 31st here on Saturn.
[84:41.43]Yeah, I don't know.
[84:42.07]You never know.
[84:42.83]I told you, like, but the people watching the stream, my Twitch demographics...
[84:48.82]are they say like okay I get like 45 united states like 22 UK like eight percent Sweden eight percent Canada and seven percent Mercury so I I have to say that
[85:17.68]See look at these big US Army boxes, they're huge That's what I thought I was getting myself into just don't do that shit again save it There's probably like a dedicated save button, but I'm too lazy to look up what the fuck it is You're doing well talk But watch yourself
[85:44.73]The Bud Light All-Star.
[85:51.05]Imagine being a Bud Light All-Star.
[85:56.70]I made a really, really great reference here.
[85:59.38]Just remember what it was.
[86:03.82]And then, okay, see?
[86:06.00]Look at this.
[86:07.07]Look at that.
[86:08.46]They just have like a laptop decal on there on the top.
[86:12.23]It says USR, but USR, it's the same green box.
[86:16.45]That's the only difference.
[86:18.95]And they put it right next to this breakable box.
[86:22.16]So my side swipe can actually break it.
[86:24.06]Alright.
[86:38.91]Tommy gun!
[86:41.45]Hey, look!
[86:42.31]A Tommy gun!
[86:47.11]God damn it.
[86:47.71]I tried to aim down sights.
[86:52.72]That's not how it works in these games.
[86:54.08]This game doesn't have aim down sights.
[86:56.26]It's from 2003.
[86:56.80]I'm about the ladder.
[87:02.61]Let's go down here first.
[87:05.31]Zombinium.
[87:07.93]Let me out of here.
[87:11.47]Lots of stuff.
[87:15.22]And there's another door that I can't get in.
[87:20.54]Now we're BioShock.
[87:21.44]At least now I'll be able to go like... I wasn't going to do something terrible.
[87:26.26]You will automatically dismount the top or bottom.
[87:28.11]Press mouse 4 to slide down a ladder.
[87:30.77]That's very quick.
[87:34.63]That is, like, hand-meltingly quick.
[87:38.34]Alright, let's do it.
[87:39.38]Open up the door.
[87:41.40]And there was a cutscene right here, I can't believe it.
[87:44.08]No, actually there wasn't.
[87:46.22]Does not have a checkpoint here.
[87:51.58]Abbot State Penetration.
[87:52.70]This is huge.
[87:53.40]Okay, let me save it again.
[87:54.82]Oh, God.
[88:08.28]The flashlight seems to just light up my area, like my gun.
[88:13.91]Why wouldn't it be like, why can't it go like a little further than that?
[88:17.50]I don't need them.
[88:18.36]I'm lighting myself up.
[88:19.76]I'm making myself easier to see.
[88:31.02]It's just easier to see what you're doing in third person.
[88:36.22]Looks like we're watching a movie.
[88:37.58]What movie are we gonna watch?
[88:45.37]It's a projector.
[88:46.11]Okay, what about the CRTV?
[88:51.87]When performing a lethal injection, it is essential that the needles be placed with absolute precision.
[88:59.56]And unlike standard medical procedures, with a lethal injection you have a patient who probably does not want the procedure to occur.
[89:07.54]Therefore, it is of vital importance that the restraints be tight and strong.
[89:13.35]Even with that, trouble may arise, and it may be incumbent upon the practitioner to take matters into his own hands.
[89:20.43]Okay.
[89:20.65]Is this guy real?
[89:21.13]This guy's just a movie.
[89:23.29]I'm realizing this now.
[89:24.39]Class dismissed.
[89:45.22]So this guy is just a projector.
[89:47.08]He's just a movie being projected onto a screen, and yet he has real-world consequences.
[89:58.75]Alright, that was just, that was clearly Slimer from Ghostbusters 1.
[90:02.67]Playing with the exposure levels in Photoshop.
[90:11.64]Hello?
[90:17.32]I almost just unload on this guy.
[90:20.42]Wait, what the fuck?
[90:22.66]Tor, is that you?
[90:24.52]Fuck, man.
[90:25.42]It's me, Dallas, from Eastern.
[90:27.24]This guy's dead.
[90:28.24]So quickly.
[90:30.06]What?
[90:30.42]Stop flashing shit in my face.
[90:32.20]F5 and shoot.
[90:32.80]No!
[90:32.96]I'm trying to be the good guy.
[90:44.90]Oh, who do I believe?
[90:46.10]The good or the bad?
[90:47.62]Stop that!
[90:49.78]Alright, well it's alright.
[90:51.12]We're gonna follow this guy for a little while.
[91:07.61]Look, we need to keep it interesting.
[91:08.67]If I just kill him, it's over.
[91:09.75]I just saved him.
[91:10.41]I just helped him.
[91:11.55]Hey, want some drugs?
[91:12.87]Why don't you take some extra drugs with us?
[91:15.98]We could use it where we're going.
[91:35.30]Oh no, I just turned on the same Slimer show!
[91:37.78]Wait, where is he?
[91:38.14]Where is he?
[91:38.40]Where is he?
[91:38.66]Where is he?
[91:40.58]Oh!
[91:42.59]Wait!
[91:45.53]Get out of the way!
[91:46.09]Don't run with him!
[91:47.09]Is he going to punch him?
[91:54.96]Why would you do this?
[91:56.22]Just get out of the way!
[91:57.92]He's strategically placing himself in the worst possible angles.
[92:05.56]Get out of the way Don't Get out of the way Alright, we're fine
[92:32.67]This gun sucks.
[92:35.82]Give me the pistol.
[92:36.52]Alright, keep going.
[92:41.02]Come with me.
[92:42.12]That guy's stuck.
[92:43.96]You lead the way, apparently.
[92:46.72]We got a checkpoint.
[93:00.64]Okay, well that... God damn it, dude.
[93:05.98]He has to make it out.
[93:06.74]Okay, I hope... Have to.
[93:12.94]Die!
[93:13.41]Okay, that's one...
[93:28.00]That just like, a cool shockwave.
[93:34.27]That's it, right?
[93:35.79]Almost.
[93:36.13]Come on, kill these guys before I die!
[93:40.71]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[93:46.36]Oh, shit.
[93:49.10]What is it?
[93:49.76]Is he running back and forth?
[93:56.92]I think I lost that guy.
[94:02.96]What the fuck just happened to me?
[94:04.45]I thought I just instantly died.
[94:05.99]Well, that was wrong.
[94:08.47]I'm dead.
[94:29.58]What do these guys keep coming from?
[94:38.97]Jesus, what?
[94:40.23]Why?
[94:41.57]No, don't you come down here now.
[94:43.09]Ooh, revolvers.
[94:45.99]When did I... Okay, that's cool.
[94:52.19]I'll take it.
[94:54.83]You...
[94:58.64]He's trying to get in the way.
[95:00.72]I'm serious.
[95:02.54]This is cool.
[95:03.98]What else we got?
[95:05.34]Dual revolvers.
[95:08.38]Tommy gun.
[95:09.08]Let's use the Tommy gun for a little while.
[95:25.29]This game just got a whole lot better.
[95:27.19]Wait, is that a safe?
[95:28.25]No.
[95:32.75]Alright, let's get out of here.
[95:34.35]Hopefully this guy can't fall off.
[95:35.63]Otherwise, that's going to be dangerous.
[95:40.09]There's no fall damage, I don't think, anyways.
[95:41.45]I'm running out of batteries.
[95:44.05]Alright, here we go.
[95:44.69]Is that you, daddy?
[95:45.15]Alright.
[95:54.96]Chapter two.
[95:55.72]Man, we gotta watch out.
[95:57.72]Save game.
[96:01.93]No, don't return to the last goddamn checkpoint, sir.
[96:04.69]Okay, we're good.
[96:06.51]Those fucking cutters are everywhere in here.
[96:10.05]But this is the only way to go, man.
[96:12.29]If we can bounce up out of this shit hole.
[96:13.87]I think there's like three endings in this game.
[96:16.93]I'm fairly certain of that.
[96:18.07]Okay, well, you just told us to come in here, so that's your own doing.
[96:22.58]Okay, I get it.
[96:23.28]I'm insane, so that's why he keeps showing me Slimer.
[96:27.10]I get it.
[96:47.22]I'm going to get the worst ending?
[96:48.40]Why am I going to get the worst ending?
[96:53.56]You mean the best ending?
[97:00.05]Is someone playing a harmonica?
[97:01.31]Is somebody in here?
[97:07.12]No.
[97:13.37]I swear, every time I use the facilities, if I use the bathroom, I see, like, a nightmare.
[97:25.14]They're gonna call us the Wet Bandits!
[97:30.40]Home alone!
[97:38.07]Oh, fuck!
[97:41.84]I didn't get rid of insanity.
[97:45.26]Let's open this up.
[97:46.24]Free stuff.
[97:46.64]Oh, he's got a gun.
[97:47.38]Good.
[97:49.10]I'm glad you actually have a weapon.
[97:52.85]Can I give him a flashlight, too?
[97:54.87]How do I give items?
[98:12.71]Let's open up some more of these.
[98:13.53]That's good.
[98:17.65]That's good.
[98:18.31]Full batteries.
[98:19.51]Full ammo.
[98:22.51]Okay.
[98:23.34]I think we're ready.
[98:26.94]Save it.
[98:27.90]And go find the guy playing the harmonica.
[98:36.29]Oh, that just might be the music changing.
[98:41.60]They're gonna start fighting for dialogue here.
[98:44.44]He was looking at that the whole time.
[98:46.81]Alright, let's look at the CRTV screens.
[98:47.79]I don't see anything.
[98:48.33]Might as well look up top 10 ghost videos from CRTVs.
[99:13.29]And as you see here, the blob moves across the screen.
[99:18.87]The mist takes over and goes right in front of the Viewfinder.
[99:23.58]Ghosts are real.
[99:24.66]Alright, well, that happened.
[99:37.24]Can I get a couple of fucking ee-hee's in the chat, please?
[99:43.19]Ow, ow, ow, ow, fuck.
[99:46.83]God damn it, ow.
[99:48.29]I'm so sorry, that fucking hurts so bad.
[99:58.33]I'm so sorry.
[100:01.85]That was like the tip of my fingernail that just jammed.
[100:06.71]Did I hit my head?
[100:07.57]No, I hit my finger.
[100:11.33]I'm really sorry.
[100:12.11]I don't want this guy.
[100:14.30]I want this guy around.
[100:15.60]Can we make sure I survive with this guy?
[100:32.66]This guy's gonna get up.
[100:33.50]Can't get up if you don't got a head.
[100:35.08]In a crisis.
[100:37.28]I'm telling you, look.
[100:38.64]Every time I use the bathroom.
[100:40.12]I'm traumatized.
[100:41.10]Forever.
[100:42.66]No more prisons.
[100:43.56]That's all you got on your wall.
[101:03.64]And and like a 12 alone.
[101:10.59]And a plant.
[101:11.01]I don't flush every... I don't flush every single thing.
[101:13.09]Filter is still here.
[101:14.77]Filter is still here.
[101:15.95]He's still here.
[101:16.63]Filter is shrill here.
[101:17.73]He had trouble on that last one.
[101:19.21]I had trouble on all of them, actually.
[101:20.47]Let's go.
[101:20.79]Smoke the cigarettes.
[101:21.65]Did he already go down, though?
[101:41.88]Is there like a wait?
[101:43.44]Like a wait.
[101:44.60]Follow.
[101:45.70]Follow.
[101:46.50]Wait.
[101:47.56]I really wish there was.
[101:55.44]We got more shit to do.
[101:56.46]Lower gallery.
[101:58.90]This is Hargrave.
[102:01.18]We have the situation under control in V-Block.
[102:03.42]Repeat.
[102:04.48]We have everything under control.
[102:07.12]COs should report to V-Block to receive your orders.
[102:10.72]The hour...
[102:12.07]of retribution is at hand.
[102:14.45]At last, we shall cleanse this island of the filth that infests it.
[102:23.08]Nothing.
[102:26.16]Oh, that's where he is.
[102:27.24]He's just hanging out over there.
[102:31.06]And so I'm waiting.
[102:33.97]Alright.
[102:36.40]now let's press the button everything's open now let's go hey talk the gates are open now hey talk the gates are open now we gotta keep hey talk
[102:57.47]I know.
[102:57.95]I understand.
[102:58.39]He just melted.
[102:59.21]Why are they melting?
[103:00.87]Oh, that was perfect.
[103:01.87]Watch it.
[103:02.61]Watch it.
[103:27.03]Nate, talk!
[103:28.64]The gates are open.
[103:29.58]Some guy climbed on my back and stuck a needle in my eye.
[103:33.42]He should probably leave.
[103:37.42]Good work.
[103:40.20]Ow.
[103:40.86]Let's keep moving.
[103:46.14]Nate, don't go in the poison.
[103:48.22]We need to wait until it's gone.
[103:49.78]Alright, let's go.
[103:55.12]I have one bullet in this.
[103:57.00]Probably should switch to a different weapon.
[104:00.44]Dual revolvers.
[104:01.29]There we go.
[104:01.85]Okay.
[104:03.87]Showers.
[104:06.37]Looks pretty good.
[104:07.65]Maybe we can get some free items.
[104:09.55]Nothing in there.
[104:12.93]Nope.
[104:14.90]Towels.
[104:16.74]Lots of lockers to open, though, so might as well.
[104:22.46]Mm-hmm.
[104:24.93]One of these is going to have a guy in it eventually.
[104:27.59]It's just the way it is.
[104:30.36]Anything else?
[104:30.86]This is where it gets dark and there's going to be a monster here.
[104:38.49]Fuck, man.
[104:39.49]The T-Block showers.
[104:41.25]Bad shit going down here.
[104:42.55]When I was living in T-Block, I'd rather stay stanky than shower in this place.
[104:47.53]Fuck, who turned on the water?
[104:49.63]Forget about that.
[104:50.21]Just back up.
[104:51.63]How do I get him off?
[104:55.87]He just saved me.
[104:58.45]These little mutants.
[105:00.91]He's dead, man.
[105:01.63]Like, he's not even trying to dodge me.
[105:07.36]He's standing still.
[105:08.68]Get him up!
[105:09.54]Get him up!
[105:12.62]Brutal.
[105:32.06]Why do you take so many shots?
[105:33.38]Why do half of you take shots?
[105:35.08]What?
[105:35.24]He is, like, pretty good bait, though, I will say.
[105:38.24]He's very good bait.
[105:39.34]Goddamn, come on.
[105:40.02]I gotta run out of bullets.
[106:06.51]I'm trying to save your life.
[106:13.78]No!
[106:15.10]No!
[106:19.94]God damn it.
[106:25.40]Bad ending.
[106:29.05]Did they just spawn forever?
[106:35.71]What in the...
[106:37.08]How far away is the save?
[106:38.00]916?
[106:39.10]We're going back.
[106:46.52]He's staying alive.
[106:47.30]I want to keep him here.
[106:50.44]I'm not losing him that easily.
[106:51.99]No fucking way.
[106:56.21]It's worth it.
[106:56.73]I want to keep him.
[106:58.31]I know exactly where I need to go.
[107:02.29]Yeah, here's the scary guy.
[107:07.61]Yeah, that's fine.
[107:08.49]We've already seen both TVs.
[107:10.64]What I hear is an old abandoned site on the east side of Carne.
[107:15.28]Maybe that's where the government been doing their experiments.
[107:17.98]You know, turning the inmates into those freaks of nature.
[107:20.60]Here we go.
[107:20.88]Get out of the way.
[107:21.54]Didn't they ever read Mary Shelley?
[107:23.12]Learn that shit don't ever work out.
[107:24.98]Look at that mutant thing.
[107:28.80]What the hell is it?
[107:31.58]What?
[107:31.72]What did he see there?
[107:36.43]I can't.
[107:37.00]Okay, here's the checkpoint.
[107:38.14]That's where we were.
[107:39.74]I remember I went through all these things.
[107:41.12]There's nothing in any of these.
[107:42.14]Yeah, there's one thing in here.
[107:43.74]Okay, there's the zombini.
[107:45.44]That's it.
[107:45.92]Now we just go down.
[107:47.38]Perfect.
[107:47.71]Save the game right here.
[108:02.10]I guess I could turn on the psycho mode there.
[108:04.54]Hello, Hargrave.
[108:06.20]It's on.
[108:07.15]We're good.
[108:08.17]Open the doors.
[108:08.65]It's F5 safe.
[108:28.56]I love that.
[108:30.16]I love this guy.
[108:31.59]Hey, talk!
[108:33.99]Is there one more?
[108:34.51]Wait, who's talking?
[108:35.57]What?
[108:36.27]What happened?
[108:37.59]Was I not supposed to do that?
[108:56.72]Alright, come on, let's go!
[108:57.58]We gotta go!
[109:00.58]Alright, come on!
[109:01.46]Come on!
[109:01.76]Let's go!
[109:02.11]Let's go!
[109:02.43]He just keeps running the other direction.
[109:23.26]That's it.
[109:23.72]Let's go.
[109:24.34]Move.
[109:25.18]Don't walk up the stairs again.
[109:26.70]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[109:32.33]There weren't this many last time.
[109:35.09]And I can't walk through- Let's go.
[109:43.85]Wait for the poison to go away.
[109:48.72]Come on.
[109:50.58]He has to stay alive.
[109:59.48]Alright, so we just have to speed run through this part.
[110:03.70]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[110:05.06]This is a hallucination.
[110:06.46]What?
[110:40.66]Am I missing something here?
[110:42.94]These guys need to come back later.
[110:44.12]They need to die.
[110:47.52]Are they just... These guys just don't exist?
[110:57.17]Okay, well that was a waste of like fucking 200... Did he die?
[111:03.73]Is that him?
[111:07.20]Where is he?
[111:10.22]He's not lying on the ground right now, is he?
[111:11.92]I'm pretty set.
[111:14.06]Alright, we're just going to run through.
[111:15.92]I'm going to save it and sprint through.
[111:35.49]Plenty of batteries, plenty of ammo.
[111:38.47]I'm just going to... So you guys are telling me if I just run, sprint through, he will, like, do the thing the scientists do in Half-Life 1 and just die instantly after you say follow me and walk, like, 10 feet, right?
[111:51.82]Is that what you're telling me is going to happen?
[111:53.40]I'm going to save it here just in case.
[112:00.46]Okay.
[112:02.89]I don't know what to do here.
[112:04.32]I gotta turn the gas off.
[112:06.88]Come on, follow me.
[112:07.60]How do I turn the fire off?
[112:09.10]Do I need to turn these on?
[112:34.83]I don't get it.
[112:35.31]I don't get it.
[112:39.79]I don't get it.
[112:45.99]Got to get clean.
[112:53.51]Han is bad.
[112:58.33]Wait, there's a fire extinguisher?
[112:59.83]What?
[113:00.03]I had to get out.
[113:06.57]It's too dark.
[113:07.19]I hope he's still alive.
[113:25.60]Okay, that, that, that, I can't, now I'm on fucking fire.
[113:28.78]He's dead!
[113:29.47]Okay, he's, his head is gone.
[113:31.33]So we...
[113:40.72]You want me to shoot the fire extinguisher?
[113:42.34]You understand what's going to happen when I shoot the fire extinguisher?
[113:44.36]Yep.
[113:48.30]Follow, follow, follow, follow.
[113:50.46]Does that work?
[113:51.60]Alright, come on, go!
[113:53.06]Come on!
[113:53.24]Get in here!
[114:07.52]Get in!
[114:08.32]Good.
[114:08.88]Okay.
[114:10.12]Nice.
[114:10.88]Don't die.
[114:12.08]I can't shoot anything here.
[114:14.24]Alright, stay here.
[114:15.54]No, no, no.
[114:15.86]Can I close the door?
[114:16.42]No, I can't.
[114:17.38]Good.
[114:17.50]We're good.
[114:18.28]Excellent work.
[114:19.92]Alright, he's alive.
[114:21.30]We're both alive.
[114:22.48]And we made it.
[114:26.74]Save game.
[114:27.78]Success.
[114:30.19]Control station is this way.
[114:31.61]Good.
[114:35.07]And we still have them.
[114:36.55]I need to get rid of these grenades.
[114:40.27]That's what I call teamwork.
[114:41.29]Alright, losing that.
[114:46.79]Flashlight batteries.
[114:47.79]Why do I keep getting flashlights?
[114:49.33]Alright, flashbangs.
[114:51.87]Now I actually have flashbangs and grenades.
[114:53.64]Wait.
[114:55.18]Yes.
[114:56.12]Okay.
[114:58.18]There are flashbangs here.
[114:59.28]I want to test and see what these do.
[115:04.92]This shit goes back to World War II.
[115:07.64]Army or Navy or some shit had a base on this island.
[115:10.95]It's near the road that goes to the docks.
[115:13.09]That's gotta be where they started their experiments.
[115:15.71]Trying to create a super soldier or some insane shit.
[115:20.26]Some insane shit.
[115:22.86]Waze's shit was great.
[115:25.06]Okay, let's go.
[115:29.66]Back when Army of Two came out.
[115:31.42]Huh?
[115:32.12]Are we getting shot at?
[115:33.50]Alright, we're ready.
[115:34.42]They're shooting at us.
[115:36.99]What was that from?
[115:54.10]Hey, they're shooting!
[115:56.38]They're shooting at us!
[115:59.08]What is that?
[116:00.02]That's from a movie, right?
[116:03.14]I don't know what movie.
[116:06.72]Now that ship can revolver him up.
[116:10.88]I think we just have to make it through.
[116:23.45]Well, the nightmare before Christmas.
[116:24.53]Oh, there it is.
[116:25.07]Yeah.
[116:26.29]Alright.
[116:29.29]I can... There's a place to go in here.
[116:33.65]Doesn't open.
[116:34.13]Of course not.
[116:35.41]I don't want him to die.
[116:36.73]So... Keep him alive.
[116:40.87]Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
[116:45.53]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[116:47.47]In here?
[116:49.84]He's alive, right?
[116:50.53]Yes, he is.
[116:50.89]Let's try this door.
[116:53.82]Nope.
[116:59.71]Yeah, I know I know I've never I've never read Mary Shelley, but I know what you're talking about Yes, I can jump over that up there, okay
[117:28.43]Hey, didn't they ever read Frankenstein?
[117:31.13]Have you ever read Frankenstein?
[117:32.59]Get out of the way.
[117:37.65]He keeps trying to start the same conversation.
[117:40.69]Alright, can he get up here?
[117:42.01]Or is he just too brainless to come up here?
[117:55.91]I wonder if I like to survive this place.
[117:58.67]You got to become it.
[118:00.55]I tried to fight it, but it's no use.
[118:05.60]Tommy gun ammo.
[118:06.70]Oh, yeah, you found a way.
[118:09.16]Hold on.
[118:11.24]What did he just do?
[118:14.46]Where is he going?
[118:18.16]Am I dropping a ladder for him?
[118:19.28]I'm not sure what I'm opening here.
[118:28.16]What does this do?
[118:30.86]Anybody catching this?
[118:34.58]I don't know.
[118:40.00]Okay.
[118:42.08]I've yet to figure that out.
[118:45.50]We gotta save.
[118:47.22]I gotta get this guy too.
[118:48.38]This is the gnome in Left 4 Dead.
[118:50.89]I have to get this guy all the way to the end.
[118:53.91]Tommy gun.
[118:54.33]Let's pull that out and use it for gnome.
[119:03.85]I skipped this part?
[119:07.29]How did I skip this?
[119:09.03]We're, like, going back in.
[119:09.91]Alright.
[119:15.35]Checkpoint.
[119:19.12]Uh... The gnome in Flamethrower Instructions.
[119:31.59]I'm assuming there's going to be a flamethrower.
[119:34.75]Which, uh... Huh?
[119:37.63]What?
[119:40.99]Where is he?
[119:42.21]He's screaming at nothing.
[119:43.35]Where are you?
[119:43.87]Don't tell me I'm gonna lose him.
[119:52.56]He's, like, inside of a wall somewhere.
[119:54.86]Where did he go?
[119:57.00]Come on.
[119:57.58]Follow me.
[119:59.98]We don't got time for this.
[120:15.94]Okay, good.
[120:17.24]I was gonna say.
[120:19.07]Come on, get through there.
[120:24.39]Come on!
[120:25.13]Why won't he come on here?
[120:31.60]Go.
[120:33.86]Maybe he just appears later.
[120:39.60]I really thought that was him for a second.
[120:40.90]I was gonna be very, very sad.
[120:44.00]You ever seen Mary Shelley's Dracula?
[120:47.24]It's a crazy tale.
[120:51.45]Scary shit.
[120:56.61]Damn it.
[121:00.55]I hear something.
[121:05.21]Whoa, he's on my back.
[121:10.63]Still no sign of him.
[121:16.04]Oh, come on.
[121:17.42]Get these fucking Doctor Strangers out of here.
[121:21.08]I hate these guys.
[121:21.74]We're just going to move.
[121:29.95]Oh, shit.
[121:31.69]Okay, we're going to have to go three, two, one, action.
[121:40.94]Where?
[121:42.22]What door is he going to be behind?
[121:46.45]Oh, God.
[121:47.25]That guy's... Is that guy alive?
[121:53.41]Well... I'm just losing him.
[122:07.63]That guy just PogChamped me.
[122:20.97]You ain't dead after that, then I don't know what to say.
[122:22.53]Alright, is this guy alive?
[122:30.92]Who said that?
[122:33.26]Did he just say that?
[122:38.06]What happened?
[122:38.52]Okay.
[122:39.88]Oh boy, we're fucking skiing around.
[122:49.57]Alright, he's not coming back from that one.
[122:53.61]This doesn't even open.
[122:55.65]So, I think we lost our friend.
[122:58.52]Because he just refused to... This place changes you.
[123:07.24]Full flares.
[123:08.92]Everybody in the trash can.
[123:10.00]Alright, let's move.
[123:21.29]I don't even... I don't know.
[123:25.77]I guess he's just not going to follow us.
[123:30.51]Go to the infirmary.
[123:37.50]I only got 25 bullets.
[123:47.72]Pull him out.
[123:53.52]Dude, this is like revolutionary back in like 2001.
[123:56.32]Switching between first and third person.
[124:01.67]This was a revolution.
[124:03.77]Nice.
[124:13.10]Oh, shit.
[124:14.18]Okay.
[124:16.54]Keep it down.
[124:17.12]He's gonna hear you.
[124:21.32]God damn it.
[124:21.88]Hold on.
[124:22.22]I gotta... Where?
[124:25.10]Ah!
[124:26.98]I'm coming.
[124:28.62]I'm coming.
[124:28.92]I'm coming.
[124:29.20]I'm coming.
[124:29.50]I'm coming.
[124:32.50]Oh, man.
[124:32.84]You're here.
[124:33.70]You gotta save us before Hargrave gets back.
[124:35.76]You gotta cut us down.
[124:36.62]I don't think so.
[124:38.74]My prisoners never make it out alive.
[124:41.14]They're gonna get lit up.
[124:49.02]What?
[124:49.20]Nice tie.
[124:50.22]Huh?
[124:50.62]What?
[125:10.62]Okay, this just kind of jumped out of nowhere, man.
[125:12.53]Alright, you know what?
[125:14.79]I ain't fucking around anymore.
[125:19.91]Rip him in half.
[125:22.15]No, I gotta jump.
[125:27.34]Skewer this guy.
[125:33.16]Can I go in that door and just start getting him?
[125:35.80]Get him!
[125:37.41]Get him!
[125:39.78]Oh, I'm gonna die!
[125:45.30]I'm gonna heal, I'm gonna throw like three flashbangs in there.
[125:49.53]Here we go.
[125:49.77]Alright, that's what I wanted.
[126:09.63]What?!
[126:09.87]I'm gonna die!
[126:19.31]Let me control this.
[126:33.90]I win!
[126:34.52]Woo!
[126:40.09]That guy didn't even like have to die.
[126:41.53]Alright, we're good.
[126:45.99]I'm winning.
[126:46.41]I'm winning so far.
[126:50.67]Good thing I saw this.
[126:51.62]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if that guy runs downstairs.
[126:56.54]Hey man, you ever seen Frankenstein before?
[127:02.38]Oh God, they're coming in.
[127:04.34]Somebody's texting me.
[127:08.02]Ooh!
[127:10.13]There's no cooldown period.
[127:11.77]I can just hold this down forever.
[127:13.83]Oh, god damn it.
[127:19.80]How many browns are in here?
[127:25.44]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this for this long.
[127:31.53]Okay, I think we did it.
[127:35.63]Okay.
[127:38.21]So...
[127:43.80]I think I'm gonna get off.
[127:45.18]I think I'm gonna get off the gun.
[127:47.58]Very slowly.
[127:48.82]I'm so riled up right now that, like, if you walked in this room and, like, grabbed me by the shoulder, I would, like, SPIT IN ME!
[127:53.00]Like, you know what I mean?
[127:53.70]I'm gonna slowly... Like, five people in this room at the same time are gonna bring me down.
[127:58.85]Jeremy...
[128:00.02]Jeremy, and I'm sitting there like holding it, like shaking.
[128:04.18]Jeremy, just let go of the trigger.
[128:06.38]Put the safety on.
[128:08.06]Slowly back away from me.
[128:09.41]Very good job.
[128:10.01]You did a great job, man.
[128:11.43]Good job.
[128:11.79]And I'm like, I did a good job.
[128:13.45]I did a good job.
[128:15.05]And yes, you did.
[128:16.31]Okay, come on up.
[128:17.89]Don't touch me, man.
[128:18.99]Don't touch me.
[128:20.11]Okay, alright.
[128:22.32]That's what would happen if that happened to me.
[128:26.68]The sheriff had a lot of stuff.
[128:31.27]What's in here?
[128:31.71]Soda?
[128:35.06]Uh, alright.
[128:35.90]So, I mean, just make sure this guy doesn't come back.
[128:37.68]Oh, god damn it.
[128:40.78]He's gonna come back.
[128:42.90]Anybody whose head you can't explode, they're always gonna come back.
[128:47.35]Well, let me just, like, make sure I have everything and save.
[128:54.11]Put the fucking phone down.
[128:58.43]Where's my friend?
[129:02.92]Check.
[129:03.28]I don't want to miss anything.
[129:04.20]Let's check.
[129:05.30]Make sure these guys don't come back.
[129:07.44]You know?
[129:07.72]Because they might.
[129:09.28]They might come back.
[129:10.88]We don't want that.
[129:12.28]Let's give them a proper burial.
[129:13.54]Let's knock down the... Whatever.
[129:17.70]Alright.
[129:17.96]V block.
[129:18.54]No, no, no.
[129:19.48]I want to make sure I don't miss anything before I press that button.
[129:28.08]I'm ready to press it.
[129:29.56]Except I actually want to save.
[129:36.61]Save or read Mary Shelley?
[129:42.98]Never played here.
[129:45.84]The Man in Black, never played here.
[129:47.54]Hmm.
[129:50.22]Cryptic.
[129:51.98]Ooh, nice and cryptic.
[129:54.38]The way I like it.
[129:56.44]I like when a game really goes into your brain and gets all cryptic.
[130:01.71]Makes you really think about, like, as a gamer.
[130:06.01]I get it.
[130:07.99]I'm banana black.
[130:13.11]Climb something?
[130:15.85]Make sure this guy doesn't come back.
[130:18.12]Is he going to come back?
[130:27.92]Jump on the dumpster?
[130:31.18]I guess.
[130:35.42]There we go.
[130:36.15]That was a high jump.
[130:40.77]Anybody in there?
[130:41.51]There's going to be a guy in there and he's going to come on the monitor and go, you've made it this far.
[130:45.91]Maybe not so far after you go through this door.
[130:51.12]Make sure this guy doesn't fucking come back.
[130:52.38]Wow, they actually... I almost shot the gun.
[130:59.10]That would have been bad.
[130:59.74]That would have been very bad.
[131:01.78]That would have been not cool.
[131:04.83]Ah, shit.
[131:07.89]No, I want to go back.
[131:10.05]Wait, is he here?
[131:17.07]I have to go back because I want to go in the other doors because there might be stuff in there.
[131:23.09]Run him into a wall.
[131:24.79]Alright.
[131:25.73]Let's go.
[131:26.43]Look at how much health I have.
[131:27.24]I need to examine.
[131:28.06]Daddy.
[131:29.70]Help me, Daddy.
[131:38.66]Alright.
[131:38.96]Honest to God, that was some, like, that spawned in the game.
[131:44.98]That wasn't like a, oh, wow, look out, scary monster.
[131:47.08]No, that spawned.
[131:49.38]That was a terrifying spawn.
[131:55.80]Revolver, ammo.
[132:00.30]Okay.
[132:01.04]I should be, like, sucked down and flushed into the toilet.
[132:09.61]What else is there?
[132:10.33]I know there was one more.
[132:11.35]There's this door over here.
[132:17.59]I wanted to flush that guy so bad.
[132:20.73]More revolvers.
[132:21.77]See, I knew I should have done that.
[132:29.45]Ah, don't do it!
[132:29.95]Come on.
[132:34.67]Oh, he's dead.
[132:38.28]Okay, close the door.
[132:39.80]Okay, monsters can't open doors.
[132:41.12]That's what I remember from every video game.
[132:43.16]Zombies don't know how to open doors.
[132:48.64]Their AI can run into the door.
[132:51.44]There's a Tommy gun.
[132:52.50]Let's get this rolling.
[132:55.22]I can open this.
[132:56.36]Good thing I have one of the zombini.
[132:58.33]Let's take a look at the CRTV.
[133:02.15]Empty.
[133:04.29]Ah, shit.
[133:04.95]CRTV is empty.
[133:07.47]And this opens... ...the doors downstairs.
[133:17.98]Okay.
[133:18.10]Watch out, there's monsters behind us.
[133:20.10]Alright.
[133:20.40]That's it.
[133:20.68]I don't want to fight you.
[133:21.80]Let's just get out of here.
[133:24.60]I got what I wanted.
[133:25.26]I got the items.
[133:49.05]Bring it back out here.
[133:49.83]There's a fight.
[133:50.47]Let's see.
[133:53.90]I'm so sad that we lost our friend.
[133:59.20]That guy's dead.
[133:59.86]Okay.
[134:01.68]This is all just scripted shit around just to have... Oh, whoops.
[134:13.01]Huh?
[134:13.43]Why am I getting bad grades for this?
[134:16.32]I'm getting... Why?
[134:17.44]These guys were shooting at me like fucking five minutes ago.
[134:20.20]You're gonna give me a bad grade?
[134:22.90]For what?
[134:27.65]What do you mean stop?
[134:28.81]Those guys were shooting at me earlier.
[134:30.95]I was being attacked by that very same faction.
[134:37.01]Explain to me how the warden goes, Shoot him, boys!
[134:40.76]And I start getting shot by those police officers.
[134:42.58]And then all of a sudden, don't shoot them anymore.
[134:44.92]Don't go after them.
[134:47.71]They're good guys now.
[134:48.57]These two, like, red shirts are just gonna die instantly.
[134:57.71]See?
[135:01.65]Oh, that's the guy that's making the gas.
[135:08.34]There's the monotone man.
[135:23.65]This doesn't open?
[135:25.33]It does.
[135:31.77]Where is our friend?
[135:34.19]This is not cool.
[135:35.63]I'm not happy.
[135:37.60]Huh?
[135:37.70]Over where?
[135:51.21]Hey, I say I come in peace.
[135:53.76]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[135:58.52]Why am I not supposed to shoot these guys?
[136:01.10]And you know what?
[136:01.58]I missed something back here.
[136:02.58]So... I ain't doing that.
[136:07.99]I'm going back and I'm going to look through the woods over here.
[136:09.99]Because I opened a special door.
[136:15.40]And there's probably special items.
[136:19.03]I don't want to miss anything.
[136:20.16]See?
[136:20.58]Look.
[136:21.02]I know I should have came back here.
[136:26.10]Never mind.
[136:26.60]Maybe they're shooting because I shot first.
[136:31.57]No, they shot first at me.
[136:34.35]I was retaliating.
[136:35.21]I was doing return fire.
[136:45.65]Alright, so that's what we're going to do.
[136:46.55]I'm going to pull out the revolver.
[136:47.45]I'm going to go for a sniper on this guy on the left.
[136:51.79]Oh, no.
[136:52.45]Don't kill him, right?
[136:53.63]I'm not going to... Well, fine.
[136:54.59]I won't... Yikes!
[137:08.79]Why aren't you shooting now, boys?
[137:11.31]I'm holding your fire now.
[137:13.39]Wait...
[137:17.41]Ah, you know, yeah, it's time.
[137:22.37]Wait, they're getting burnt by the light.
[137:29.22]Probably should keep that in mind.
[137:32.02]I think I'm getting burnt by the light, too.
[137:37.78]Yeah.
[137:38.34]Is that healing down?
[137:41.68]Holy shit.
[137:46.06]whoa whoa run away very clearly there are no humans down here man what the fuck oh come on that is dog shit it really is they're just dropping bombs you don't want me to shoot those guys I love to watch you work
[138:18.21]Yeah, I already did it.
[138:19.63]I already did that move.
[138:20.91]I'm gonna die.
[138:25.38]Oh, come on.
[138:29.62]No, come on.
[138:30.66]Oh.
[138:44.42]Wait, what?
[138:44.94]Why is this?
[138:45.50]Why is this here?
[138:46.58]What?
[138:46.92]Why is this?
[138:50.14]This was behind the TNT.
[138:51.46]This was hiding behind the... I blew up the TNT and it turned into this.
[138:58.51]That's some Transformer shit right there.
[139:11.56]On low.
[139:11.90]Keeping the faith.
[139:14.49]These guys are booty pain.
[139:22.94]Why can't I just have this forever?
[139:24.04]Okay, I think we're safe.
[139:28.12]Let's get some more healing.
[139:30.70]That's it.
[139:32.40]That's so unfortunate.
[139:34.00]That's it.
[139:36.71]You gotta get at least like two or three healing potions over here, man.
[139:39.47]No, that's not it.
[139:40.17]That's not it.
[139:45.97]Well, that's a good thing I went back on here.
[139:49.05]Because I would have died, for sure.
[139:52.23]Alright, now can we go?
[139:58.17]Am I going to be allowed to keep moving?
[140:01.27]That's all that's there.
[140:09.00]Back to nearly full health.
[140:12.72]No, okay.
[140:16.07]I do have an insanity mode.
[140:17.45]I'm not going to use it.
[140:20.47]Not yet.
[140:25.21]Oh, that would have been a disaster if I didn't save.
[140:33.17]Come on, really?
[140:33.77]Do I have to really go all the way around?
[140:38.65]No.
[140:42.05]Open!
[140:43.45]Don't save.
[140:44.73]If I don't save, we're gonna have to go back like 32 minutes.
[140:47.53]New NPC.
[140:53.11]A shotgun from up there.
[140:59.54]Well, that's a mistake.
[141:17.37]Uh, new weapon, shotgun unlocked.
[141:19.51]Holy Jesus.
[141:31.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[141:33.66]Come on, I'm right into that.
[141:43.62]I hear more things, I do hear- I hear more things!
[141:54.64]ah let me get this it's an instant kill too much damage alright where were those shotguns nothing else that's it I don't think I can climb over there and there's no shotgun
[142:20.79]No, it's just fire.
[142:21.61]If I go over there, I'm going to die.
[142:22.79]So we're going to go into the West Celebration.
[142:30.80]I wonder how far through the game I am.
[142:33.48]Anybody know?
[142:36.32]What percentage complete is this game at this point?
[142:43.54]Smashed my wedding picture.
[142:46.50]How could you?
[142:47.44]Excuse me.
[142:52.56]read a sign outside the door I can hear them scrape against it they'll get through soon enough while I wait wait to die I just wanted to tell everyone who might be listening I've been looking for some answer what's going on there isn't any there's no answer there's no explanation it's just
[143:22.07]It's the best actor so far.
[143:23.65]We are at its mercy.
[143:27.80]I have seen the unspeakable.
[143:30.24]And I won't be at its mercy anymore.
[143:36.22]I'm actually... I can't believe they got... Wait, did he just... That guy just shot himself.
[143:40.22]Okay.
[143:42.60]I was gonna say it's remarkable that they actually got George Clooney to be in this game.
[143:48.17]Okay.
[143:52.54]That's pretty heinous.
[143:57.15]More NPCs.
[144:02.95]A lot of people dead in this quarter.
[144:09.75]Jesus.
[144:12.41]Shotgun shells.
[144:13.70]That's what I'm talking about.
[144:14.58]Where is the shotgun, though?
[144:17.82]Can I make the morning announcements here?
[144:22.81]after school the drama club will be meeting under the gym and today's food is gonna be sloppy Joe's and it'll be a dollar eight I wasn't going for that I was I wasn't going for a joke there I wasn't going you don't tell me that's a minus one or a plus one or I don't want to see that that was just me I was just mimicking a principle
[144:58.21]Get hunter pounced.
[145:03.67]Well, it's true.
[145:04.39]I wasn't trying to make like a joke.
[145:05.89]A joke.
[145:10.04]If I was trying to make a like real joke, you would have heard me be like, oh, get ahead.
[145:14.30]I would have like set it up and would have been really, really energetic about it.
[145:19.59]Who's falling from the sky?
[145:22.33]I think the prison is rioting right now.
[145:23.85]That's cool.
[145:25.17]So defensive.
[145:26.75]Make sure these guys don't come back!
[145:29.08]That guy has black blood.
[145:33.92]He's already turning.
[145:40.36]Officer station or visitation?
[145:42.08]Easy.
[145:48.90]Oh, not easy.
[145:54.99]He's like five feet away from me.
[146:00.47]Okay, the vis-a-state.
[146:04.80]The guy that can one-handedly shoot it.
[146:12.10]Enough time to reload the gun.
[146:13.46]Good work.
[146:14.36]Nice job, Jeremy.
[146:22.28]Many more.
[146:22.68]I think that's it.
[146:29.39]72 Tommy Gun ammo.
[146:33.57]I really want to just look in the stall, but... Yeah, I would really love to go in the stall, but somebody stunk it up.
[146:38.94]I gotta wait.
[146:43.26]That actually scared me.
[146:44.50]If I had a face kill... I think that's why I came in here.
[146:49.38]To get extra health.
[146:54.35]Not enough.
[147:00.20]Where's this dripping coming from?
[147:01.94]Yo, who that?
[147:04.06]What?
[147:04.80]Okay.
[147:07.38]Oh, hello, honey.
[147:23.49]Oh, you're pregnant?
[147:25.15]Oh, okay.
[147:26.21]See you later.
[147:30.58]Pregnant?
[147:31.64]Goodbye!
[147:34.06]What?
[147:36.32]Oh, that was no good.
[147:38.34]What?
[147:39.39]What the fuck?
[147:41.29]I haven't saved it in quite... I'm stuck in the wall!
[148:04.75]Come on.
[148:06.09]Break room.
[148:06.85]I gotta use this as long as I can.
[148:08.03]Okay, good.
[148:13.40]I see a glimmer of hope for you yet.
[148:16.44]A means of escape.
[148:17.84]Oh, a meme!
[148:19.25]I see a meme of escape.
[148:21.63]Suss!
[148:22.45]Show me how you work when the answer is not so direct.
[148:31.84]Uh, so that guy just tried to, like, make, like, a big puzzle in this room.
[148:36.38]And his master plan was just to put a bunch of stuff in the way.
[148:41.36]How will you react to this when you have no idea how to get through that door?
[148:45.78]It's covered with all kinds of debris!
[148:50.24]Oh, blast!
[148:50.98]He solved the riddle!
[148:55.14]Shotgun.
[149:00.50]Let's see.
[149:00.90]If there is...
[149:02.44]If there is a God, then why has he let me die?
[149:05.36]It's not, that's the English theory.
[149:09.06]We're going to, let's go over this sentence here.
[149:10.48]First of all, capital I, excuse me.
[149:13.30]If there is a God, God, the lowercase O-D, the capital G is good, comma.
[149:21.01]If there is a God, comma, then why did, instead of has, cross that out with a red paper, red ink and right over here, did, why did he let me die?
[149:33.40]And then that's how you get an A. I'm trying to get out of it.
[149:44.92]I pressed... I would aim down sights.
[149:46.51]I don't even need to say anything.
[149:47.41]You guys know what I mean.
[149:51.65]Turn on the Prinklers.
[149:59.74]Mm-hmm.
[150:00.40]And after a little while, the fires will go out.
[150:03.80]And... 40 shotgun rounds.
[150:09.71]Oh, my.
[150:10.45]Okay, the shotgun is not good.
[150:13.23]Can I ever upgrade weapons?
[150:14.51]I feel like I really would like to.
[150:20.84]It's like one, two... That was two shots.
[150:25.30]Um...
[150:27.17]So why again?
[150:28.15]Oh god damn it, I have to pick up the different phones.
[150:33.26]No, you don't have to answer any phones.
[150:36.66]Can I move this cabinet?
[150:40.92]I'm going to turn on the sprinklers in the other direction.
[150:43.00]I think that's what I have to do.
[150:45.91]No.
[150:54.35]So how do I get over there?
[150:59.26]Do I have to jump up there?
[151:00.32]I don't know.
[151:11.85]I mean, I'm going to assume I have to use these for something.
[151:16.87]No, I don't.
[151:17.45]Well, then what the hell?
[151:21.36]Go through the fire?
[151:22.36]No, why would I do that?
[151:30.20]Can I, like, direct the water?
[151:31.72]Can I cover myself in water and then sprint?
[151:36.24]Just push these over the fire?
[151:38.07]That's not really how, like, fire works.
[151:45.83]I'm gonna be in big trouble for this.
[151:48.05]This is gonna hurt.
[151:55.88]God damn it.
[151:57.90]They're like, why would I listen to you guys?
[151:59.74]Why did I do that?
[152:03.94]Now the game thinks I went through.
[152:20.45]This is like what he was talking about.
[152:21.91]The puzzle.
[152:22.77]Yes, you figure it out.
[152:24.81]And oh, your reaction when you see it.
[152:31.30]That face went, and you see it.
[152:32.44]Is it like a drain?
[152:56.05]Oh.
[152:59.35]I looked at the thing I needed to do so the game started to progress.
[153:04.02]Give me a break.
[153:06.70]I looked at the thing and it spawned enemies.
[153:09.76]I knew what to do.
[153:11.06]Oh shit, he figured it out.
[153:19.17]Might as well spawn enemies.
[153:20.17]And they're in the worst place.
[153:21.87]Let's just move this one.
[153:25.39]Shoot the fire?
[153:28.72]That's not how it works.
[153:34.16]There.
[153:35.06]There we go.
[153:37.64]Now it's going to slowly trickle over there.
[153:40.28]And gotcha.
[153:47.52]Yeah, I take it back.
[153:48.98]I do like the shotgun.
[153:51.40]Shotgun is actually really good.
[153:52.78]I hope I get a lot of ammo for it because it's the only weapon I want to use.
[153:56.53]I'm real big into shotguns.
[153:57.53]You guys know that?
[154:09.80]You didn't do a good job.
[154:13.68]If you were wondering.
[154:15.22]Alright, well there's that.
[154:21.26]Let's open this one.
[154:26.00]Okay, can you redo that for a second?
[154:32.99]There's more healing.
[154:33.75]Alright, there we are.
[154:39.54]There are way too many grenades.
[154:41.02]Think about how many flashbangs you've seen in this game.
[154:47.70]There's too many flashbangs.
[154:54.68]Give me health.
[154:55.34]Alright, nothing important.
[155:01.70]Let's open the door.
[155:03.40]Car block.
[155:07.91]Anything new?
[155:15.05]Where?
[155:15.31]They can't get in here.
[155:19.31]What do I care?
[155:19.85]The game spawned them in the wrong spot.
[155:26.04]What do I care if the game screwed it up?
[155:31.92]Not that one.
[155:39.50]Not this one.
[155:45.75]Oh.
[155:46.90]Horace.
[155:49.30]Hello, Horace.
[155:55.68]Did I miss the call?
[156:00.76]I think I missed the phone call.
[156:02.62]They gave up.
[156:03.66]They didn't call during normal business hours.
[156:10.32]Okay, that was dumb.
[156:11.27]Okay.
[156:22.98]Hey!
[156:24.33]Easy.
[156:27.17]Let's get back to the shotgun here.
[156:32.21]Come on.
[156:34.13]Whoa!
[156:59.49]And he exploded.
[157:00.29]I only have two rounds left in this stupid thing.
[157:04.83]Let's go back to the Tommy gun.
[157:08.75]Reload.
[157:09.29]And it looks like there's a way to go down there.
[157:14.57]Laundry room.
[157:17.05]For your dry and fold needs.
[157:21.11]Ha ha!
[157:22.47]Ha!
[157:23.47]Ha!
[157:26.81]Ha ha!
[157:39.03]Ooh.
[157:39.92]This place changes.
[157:41.82]At least they have healing in here.
[157:44.14]Don't test me.
[157:44.70]Nice tattoo.
[157:45.20]What did the other one do?
[158:06.60]Do we go in the hole, or do we go through the main door?
[158:12.10]Let's save and go down here, just in case something terrible is down here.
[158:15.58]I have to pee again.
[158:19.68]Oh, great.
[158:20.24]We're going down in the mole hole.
[158:27.02]Oh, great.
[158:32.79]Did he just... This guy will never forgive me.
[158:37.42]I'll never forgive you!
[158:40.24]You shot at a bunch of my friends!
[158:42.84]You bastard!
[158:48.80]Got a lot more ammo.
[158:54.35]The first person... The flashlight doesn't really do very much.
[159:06.65]And, ladies and gentlemen, that's how you fucking find a secret hidden enemy that would have jumpscared me.
[159:10.35]You accidentally throw a flashbang.
[159:15.06]Uh-huh.
[159:25.01]Okay.
[159:26.35]Can you please stop burping and just die?
[159:31.13]Okay, he's dead.
[159:38.89]More flashbangs?
[159:41.85]I don't want any more flashbangs.
[159:43.79]Well, it looks like going to the molehole was the right play.
[159:50.03]Because we're getting a lot of story, lore, and cutscenes.
[159:54.43]Yeah, that was his whole mole family.
[160:00.99]Okay, I heard somebody...
[160:09.20]Not today.
[160:20.74]These are the big ones, and they're awful.
[160:22.62]So we can just keep going.
[160:23.36]Go.
[160:25.32]Who's left?
[160:27.55]Couple dweebs.
[160:30.43]We got some lull dweebs down here.
[160:34.75]There's a bunch of stuff that I missed, but it's okay, I'm gonna go back.
[160:38.27]Just wanna make sure everything's dead.
[160:45.22]Turn back, turn back in three, two, turn back!
[160:54.62]Go back, run, run, run, run, run.
[160:55.64]I gotta pick it.
[161:00.11]No!
[161:00.47]Did I just throw a body?
[161:05.10]Hold on.
[161:05.78]Did a body just come out when I hit right click?
[161:11.20]Hold on.
[161:11.48]Give it a second.
[161:13.32]I think a body came out.
[161:16.98]Hold on.
[161:22.44]Goddamn crash grenade.
[161:23.71]I have like no access to my mouse.
[161:32.71]Goddamn it.
[161:36.94]Yeah, I have no mouse.
[161:38.84]I don't think I can physically get out of here.
[161:44.65]Oh, there's my mouse.
[161:45.29]Okay, hold on.
[161:48.27]So, is this... Are you going to do this to me?
[161:55.44]I'm going to give this until... Because it did this last time, so hold on.
[162:04.43]Let's read some... No.
[162:06.04]How long ago did I save it?
[162:06.94]I don't think it was that long ago.
[162:12.02]Yeah.
[162:13.66]We gotta close this out.
[162:18.24]Okay.
[162:18.76]Hold on.
[162:19.68]Give me a sec.
[162:20.22]Let me open it back up.
[162:25.64]Close your ears.
[162:26.14]Close your ears.
[162:26.54]Close your ears.
[162:26.98]It's gonna be loud.
[162:27.62]No, it's not.
[162:28.02]It's fine.
[162:35.00]Maybe five minutes saved.
[162:36.16]It was outside the hole.
[162:37.06]Okay.
[162:37.48]Well, that's not terrible.
[162:42.24]That's okay.
[162:44.14]I'm like, I'm enjoying, I'm like, I'm liking this game.
[162:47.95]I'm not, I don't, I'm not hating this.
[162:49.87]This is, look, remember, we got all week.
[162:52.59]So I'm going to get, I'm going to go until like, I'm not having a fun one with this one anymore.
[163:00.22]10, 16.
[163:00.54]That was actually, that was like less than five minutes ago.
[163:02.84]We're good.
[163:06.18]I have a lot of games to play, so don't you worry.
[163:09.83]So, we're gonna go back down here.
[163:10.89]Let's make this quick.
[163:14.01]He goes, Daddy, Daddy!
[163:16.45]I'll never forgive you!
[163:21.27]I'm just trying to speed through this.
[163:27.57]And it's gonna be to my detriment.
[163:33.97]Alright.
[163:36.93]Turn this on.
[163:39.19]Hello.
[163:41.60]Hello.
[163:42.78]Welcome to the game.
[163:44.10]Welcome to the show.
[163:44.90]This is where I went super saiyan.
[163:46.94]Let's hold off.
[163:49.24]It takes us too long to kill these guys.
[163:53.14]But I think I'm just going to stick with it.
[164:04.67]Start my streams with the Goosebumps theme on.
[164:10.00]That's the one that goes... Right?
[164:15.84]Well, that hurt.
[164:24.15]Come on, man.
[164:24.81]Like, I'm just trying to, like, rush through this shit.
[164:27.83]It's ruining my life.
[164:34.71]Okay.
[164:39.69]Good to go.
[164:44.09]Save it.
[164:44.47]I still need... I'm very low on everything.
[164:53.92]How many of these?
[164:55.96]Nobody behind me.
[165:02.50]head off.
[165:03.52]Come on.
[165:03.88]When you shoot their head off, they should at least fall off the damn ceiling.
[165:05.86]That's enough out of you.
[165:11.62]No more crash grenades, please.
[165:37.32]Okay, this is where I pull out the shotgun again and I'll keep this.
[165:51.88]Return of the ear.
[165:54.10]Let's get up there closer.
[166:05.40]Alrighty.
[166:07.10]Don't have very much health, but I think that's it for the enemies.
[166:12.88]It is.
[166:13.81]So, save it again.
[166:14.99]Let's keep the movement.
[166:22.71]I still have a Psycho mode.
[166:24.22]I still have a Super Saiyan.
[166:25.66]I'll never forgive you!
[166:33.46]I just wanted to say, I wanted to make it so he could see.
[166:40.62]This is gonna be one of those situations where, like, I killed my, like, whole family.
[166:49.95]And they're trickling the info through the whole game.
[166:52.33]About, you didn't, you killed your whole family.
[166:55.77]Yes, you did.
[167:00.57]Where am I now?
[167:05.56]Did that just... Jesus Christ.
[167:10.12]I gotta be aware of that now.
[167:15.20]So I guess that's a separate way to go.
[167:19.75]No healing anywhere.
[167:21.07]Of course there isn't.
[167:23.39]Wait, they told you that at the beginning?
[167:24.67]They did?
[167:28.83]They actually told me that?
[167:31.24]Whoops.
[167:32.84]Should I pick up this pamphlet?
[167:34.74]Grab this pamphlet out of the air.
[167:39.05]I don't think it's anything.
[167:41.07]Just a haunted sheet.
[167:50.55]Nothing.
[167:55.70]Can I not get in here?
[167:59.14]It gives you +2 charisma.
[168:02.52]I wouldn't be surprised.
[168:04.56]This game was made by Bethesda, so I wouldn't be surprised.
[168:10.26]Who actually made this game?
[168:11.78]That's a question.
[168:18.04]No!
[168:18.46]Don't do it!
[168:22.37]Save it, just in case.
[168:23.47]It's getting real crashy.
[168:26.31]It's having trouble now.
[168:27.25]I don't have any batteries.
[168:34.92]No!
[168:35.28]At least it's saved right here.
[168:44.15]You actually can pick shit up.
[168:45.27]Well, how do I read the note?
[168:51.67]Scrawled note.
[168:55.63]It doesn't say anything.
[169:03.91]Okay.
[169:04.95]Well, there's the note.
[169:05.54]Everything beautiful is... Everything's beautiful.
[169:10.56]That's all you need to know.
[169:15.96]I almost fucking ran into that fire.
[169:19.43]Oh, there he is.
[169:20.79]There's the nanomachine guy from Outlast 1.
[169:22.59]What was his name?
[169:28.73]Billy?
[169:28.99]Billy?
[169:42.29]I need more batteries.
[169:46.19]What is in here?
[169:46.67]I think you're a little indecisive.
[169:49.05]Why?
[169:49.21]Like, honestly?
[169:51.03]If you're going to do something, do it completely.
[169:54.37]I think I have to, like, shoot this guy with a knife.
[169:59.97]Where is he?
[170:04.53]What am I supposed to do with this?
[170:08.30]I guess we're climbing the ladder.
[170:11.68]That seems pretty pointless.
[170:12.58]This is how you go around.
[170:13.46]Thank you, finally.
[170:20.86]Alright, this is what we watch.
[170:26.22]NPC!
[170:32.00]I'm... I'm friendly!
[170:39.67]I'm friendly.
[170:40.81]Oh, god damn it.
[170:43.11]Just stay.
[170:47.25]Hold on.
[170:47.71]I need to get the rest of the items that are up here.
[170:50.83]At least I got the healing.
[170:51.67]Go down here?
[170:53.19]No.
[170:55.79]Leave him alone.
[171:02.30]That poor man is terrifying.
[171:04.38]He's a coward.
[171:06.34]Protect me.
[171:06.86]He'll drag you down.
[171:09.71]You're not a monster.
[171:12.37]You're not gonna kill me.
[171:15.31]I'm not gonna kill you.
[171:17.24]I've been running so long.
[171:19.18]Look, I may be a CO.
[171:20.68]Don't do sudden movements like that, man.
[171:22.36]I always thought I had more in common with the inmates than the gung-ho COs they got here at Abbott.
[171:26.80]Well, I don't want to waste battery.
[171:29.35]He's weak.
[171:33.45]Now, the only idea I have is that we gotta call for help.
[171:37.04]Somebody has to be able to help us.
[171:39.80]Come on.
[171:40.40]We need to get to the radio.
[171:41.34]Hey, who the fuck is talking to you, man?
[171:42.64]We're gonna call from there.
[171:44.06]You keep me safe?
[171:45.00]Let's go.
[171:45.78]You gonna listen to that guy?
[171:46.78]Hopefully not.
[171:48.26]My mom always said God was gonna judge us someday.
[171:51.43]It's gonna rain fire down from above.
[171:54.45]It ain't raining fire.
[171:56.01]This way.
[171:56.97]We gotta go along the top of the wall.
[171:58.63]That's...
[172:02.09]What?
[172:02.97]No, I can just shoot with the light.
[172:05.09]Everything's gonna be fine.
[172:07.31]Why is that not working?
[172:10.16]Alright, I'll get it.
[172:15.20]I'll shine the light so you survive.
[172:19.42]Just keep the light pointing that way.
[172:23.11]Eric, you gotta just keep pointing the light in the right direction.
[172:29.84]See?
[172:31.11]It's that easy.
[172:34.57]I guess it looks safe now.
[172:36.63]Come on, this way.
[172:37.57]I love this guy's scream.
[172:39.44]We're gonna call for help.
[172:43.02]Come on.
[172:43.96]Make sure I aim it down there.
[172:46.79]Come on, this way.
[172:49.39]Do it again.
[172:51.01]Lots of flashbangs.
[172:56.52]Oh, god.
[172:57.14]They're going to climb up.
[172:58.14]Where are they going to climb from?
[172:59.30]The ladder?
[173:00.96]I don't know.
[173:01.30]I don't know which way they're going to come from.
[173:02.40]I'm assuming they're going to come up the ladder, like a Dark Souls enemy.
[173:06.38]But I can't.
[173:06.80]I've got to go first person with this.
[173:08.02]There we go.
[173:14.02]I think they're just dying.
[173:15.10]You know what the magic hour is?
[173:17.20]It's when the sun's over the horizon, but it's still light out.
[173:20.88]Some folks call it twilight, but I call it the magic hour.
[173:24.20]But on Carnage, I swear, it's... You ruined my life.
[173:28.70]You ruined everyone's life.
[173:30.34]I'm just done listening to that guy.
[173:40.75]Let's go.
[173:50.17]I can't leave?
[173:50.81]Good thing that just happened.
[173:54.33]Good thing every pellet just hit the ladder.
[173:57.71]Every single one, because this place is rigged to blow.
[174:08.32]No, that guy was running around like, pick up a gun and help.
[174:31.72]So there is fall damage after all, after almost three hours of not taking fall damage.
[174:37.22]I guess there is fall damage.
[174:44.95]Alright, let me just... I'm gonna go pee one more time.
[174:48.29]And then I'll come back in a second.
[174:50.42]Be right back.
[174:51.92]No BRB screen.
[174:53.14]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[174:56.09]Jesus Christ.
[175:52.64]Wait...
[175:53.33]WHAT?! !
[176:31.36]Hey.
[176:35.37]How are you?
[176:36.19]I'm back.
[176:42.69]Yeah, it's me, Louie Anderson.
[176:45.48]Okay, before we get going,
[176:50.98]Let me just save this here.
[176:53.56]Wait, no, no, no, no.
[176:54.37]Don't save.
[176:55.23]Save what?
[176:56.69]What did I... Hold on.
[176:59.19]I want to catch up on some bits, so give me a second.
[177:02.45]Monty the Moose, thank you for the $5.
[177:03.81]Hi, you smell.
[177:06.48]I assure you I do.
[177:08.40]The Rusty Knife, thanks for the $2.50.
[177:10.28]They say b-b-b-b-b-bits.
[177:12.26]Oh, thank you, Rusty Knife.
[177:14.76]Pin!
[177:15.22]Pin!
[177:16.18]Pin!
[177:18.19]I recognize this name.
[177:20.42]Thank you for the 100 bits pin.
[177:22.94]Hey, Jerma Boy, just want to say you made my weekend at TwitchCon when you found me at the pretzel line near the meet and greet.
[177:30.36]I honestly must say I was taken aback by how tall you really are.
[177:34.59]God damn it.
[177:35.75]See?
[177:36.79]Yes!
[177:38.05]I always knew that chat exaggerated how short you were for a laugh, but I simply wasn't prepared to be absolutely dwarfed by your stature.
[177:45.43]I found it difficult to maintain eye contact with you due to my neck cramping from trying to look straight up for that long.
[177:52.03]Anyway, good to have you back, amigo.
[177:57.34]See?
[177:59.74]Well, Penn, all jokes aside, it was an absolute treasure.
[178:05.83]to be able to chat with you and hang out with you for a little bit.
[178:08.16]So thank you for that.
[178:10.60]And thank you for this.
[178:12.32]Thank you for letting chat know the real deal.
[178:16.94]Because being like 5'11", like 6'1", is a made-up donation.
[178:26.19]It's not a made-up donation.
[178:30.45]It's not a made-up donation.
[178:32.57]It's a real person.
[178:33.39]It's not me.
[178:34.89]I met this guy at TwitchCon.
[178:36.69]He was using the Pretzel line.
[178:38.45]And he had a Glue Man shirt on.
[178:40.19]So this guy gets like two plus ones.
[178:44.71]But anyways, thanks a lot, man.
[178:48.95]It was awesome.
[178:52.77]Also, LaFerl.
[178:53.77]This is fake.
[178:57.41]That's not fake.
[178:58.31]It's not fake.
[179:02.67]thank you referral for the bits as well this game feels like it's fast and the furious wait why we know nobody bought those shirts a lot of people bought those shirts I sold at least 15 of those shirts with a uh with a couple of zeros I sold at least 15 shirts
[179:27.71]But thank you.
[179:28.85]Thank you, YIT.
[179:34.65]The gates are open now.
[179:35.43]Well, thank you for the two bucks, man.
[179:37.50]Darkstar, thanks for the bits.
[179:38.50]Already better than the Evil Within 2.
[179:40.74]Well, I mean, you're referencing every single video game that has ever come out.
[179:48.51]But, thank you.
[179:50.23]YoungChub, thank you for the five dollars.
[179:52.67]MadItalian, thank you for the five dollars as well.
[179:55.57]No messages for these two.
[179:56.99]Thank you.
[179:59.41]Swaz B, thanks for the $1.
[180:02.06]Baby Bits, love you, Jeremy.
[180:03.48]Fave YouTuber, five out of seven.
[180:06.68]I'll take a five out of seven.
[180:07.84]That's not a bad score.
[180:10.91]Sputnik, thanks for the $5.
[180:13.29]How is this game scarier than The Evil Within 2?
[180:15.85]Cheers, Jeremiah.
[180:16.46]Love your face.
[180:17.46]Love your show.
[180:18.70]Well, first of all, thank you, Sputnik34, for the $5.
[180:21.98]How is this game scarier than The Evil Within 2?
[180:23.92]I see my previous statement.
[180:25.50]It is any other video game that has ever released in the history of all time.
[180:34.00]People that are just hanging out here that didn't watch the Evil Within 2 stream, let me bring you up to speed.
[180:44.92]Game sucks.
[180:47.03]That's it.
[180:51.29]But we're on the internet.
[180:52.65]Hold on.
[180:52.95]We're on the internet.
[180:53.57]I've got to rephrase that.
[180:54.31]This is the internet.
[180:57.49]In my opinion, which I am allowed to have, and your opinion might be different, and I respect your opinion, game sucks.
[181:07.08]There you go.
[181:10.14]I have to do that.
[181:13.50]He's still talking about it.
[181:15.66]I can't, whatever.
[181:19.93]Opinion, respect.
[181:23.70]Let's go.
[181:24.06]Alright.
[181:24.90]I'm like getting stuck here.
[181:25.85]Sometimes I get stuck.
[181:28.61]YIT, thanks again for the two bucks.
[181:30.43]Again.
[181:31.67]Leferl, again, thanks for the $2.33.
[181:32.97]I recommend you check out the game Mr. Bones.
[181:36.40]Also, any plans on adding new emotes?
[181:38.32]I actually was making a jermaLate emote before the stream started.
[181:41.38]I just didn't finish it.
[181:43.08]It's going to be a clock.
[181:44.47]It's going to be like four after seven or like five after seven.
[181:47.47]It's going to be my face like reacting on a clock and it's going to be Neptune.
[181:51.61]So there you go.
[181:53.01]That's the new emote coming up.
[181:55.81]But yes, thank you.
[181:57.51]Turian, thank you for the $6.
[181:59.93]I used to wonder what friendship could be, Jeremy, until you shared its magic with me.
[182:05.33]Big Adventure, tons of fun, a beautiful heart, faithful and strong, sharing kindness.
[182:09.43]It's an easy feat and magic makes it.
[182:11.55]I don't know what this is.
[182:13.31]You're like the king of sending me song lyrics that I read as a sentence, aren't you?
[182:18.75]It's you and a couple other people, isn't it?
[182:21.19]What did I just read?
[182:24.73]What did I just read?
[182:29.51]Stop.
[182:31.15]Of course.
[182:31.65]More like My Little Pony.
[182:32.95]That's just wonderful.
[182:43.49]Anyways, uh... Uh, Sidbad returns, thank you for the $10.
[182:48.11]I'm using the last of my Dosh to ask you to please play Alien Isolation this week.
[182:57.30]Um... Uh, maybe, I don't know, we might not have time.
[183:02.90]Just because there's at least, like, seven or eight, nine horror games that I want to play.
[183:09.16]And I was not anticipating that I was going to be having this much of a good time in the suffering.
[183:14.45]So this stream might just be like a suffering stream.
[183:19.05]You might just be suffering this stream.
[183:22.69]So I think that's what we're going to do.
[183:25.53]But remember, we're going every day this week.
[183:27.71]So we're going tonight.
[183:28.52]We're going tomorrow, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
[183:31.10]We're going every day.
[183:32.84]So what's today?
[183:33.70]Today's Wednesday, right?
[183:36.96]Yeah.
[183:37.54]So we're doing tonight, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[183:40.03]So we're going to have plenty of time.
[183:41.79]We'll see.
[183:43.59]Anyways, thank you so much, everybody.
[183:46.01]Yaro, thank you for the $1.
[183:47.27]Using an N64 controller in this game.
[183:49.03]I actually probably would rather be doing that.
[183:53.68]But once again, thank you all so much for your bits.
[183:59.09]You guys rock.
[184:00.25]And your subs, too.
[184:01.37]And your subs still haven't figured it out, but I'm going to, and I've got to pay somebody.
[184:04.63]I've got to pay a programmer to make the thing.
[184:06.59]Let me tell you what I want to do.
[184:08.57]This is what I want to do for the stream.
[184:10.71]I'm going to break it down for you just so it's set in stone that this is what you're going to see eventually here.
[184:15.93]I'm going to have end credits.
[184:19.37]at the end of a stream.
[184:20.75]And it's going to show everybody that subscribed on that stream in like a movie style credits with like a song.
[184:27.60]So you know like how I have the end intro, the end outro, right?
[184:31.67]It's gonna be, that's gonna play and there'll be credits that will be scrolling down
[184:38.65]in like one of the portions of the screen.
[184:40.81]And it'll have who subbed at what tier, the other tiers, the other tiers.
[184:45.19]I'm gonna put like random shit there.
[184:46.73]Like I'm gonna put like a random person at a chat.
[184:49.09]You know, it's gonna be like, oh, like fucking the gravy master for this stream is like fucking DeanDingus28.
[184:55.53]You know what I mean?
[184:56.41]Like I'm gonna get like random, weird denominations for people, you know?
[185:02.99]Amount of times sat in chat the longest this stream, that type of shit.
[185:08.46]And you'll be like, oh, that's me.
[185:09.58]I was here for like five hours.
[185:12.58]It should be interesting.
[185:13.75]But I have to pay a programmer to make it.
[185:16.45]But that's what I'm going to do.
[185:25.15]Yeah.
[185:26.37]Sounds like fun.
[185:27.73]What's my obsession with Dean Dingus?
[185:29.45]I don't know.
[185:29.73]It's like an easy name when you have a brainless vocabulary like me.
[185:33.95]Alright, let's go.
[185:34.73]Did the game freeze again?
[185:36.69]It did.
[185:37.45]God damn it.
[185:38.25]It's because I was out-tabbed for too long.
[185:40.64]Hold on.
[185:45.54]Let's come back in here.
[185:51.72]Midway presents NFL Blitz!
[185:55.04]Continue.
[186:01.51]Continue.
[186:07.29]Alright, this is where I was, right?
[186:10.11]At least a minute or two before.
[186:12.15]It's the note, and then we load up the next area.
[186:19.06]Right?
[186:19.42]No.
[186:19.80]How long ago was this?
[186:23.06]I don't remember how long... God damn it, really?
[186:25.88]This is actually pretty long ago.
[186:30.53]We'll just speedrun this.
[186:32.27]Don't stay in here for long, just pick up this stuff and get out.
[186:35.96]I think you're a little indecisive.
[186:40.32]If you're going to do something, do it completely.
[186:43.62]That's the Carnate way.
[186:48.61]This guy's just a Cheshire cat.
[186:50.65]So now I won't kill this guy, because obviously... We'll keep him alive.
[187:01.31]Everywhere!
[187:03.64]Found the way to get in here.
[187:37.01]Anything else?
[187:38.75]I can just skip this guy.
[187:42.93]Why would I want to skip this guy?
[187:50.97]Does he know I'm coming behind him?
[187:53.39]Oh.
[187:53.57]Save it.
[188:01.26]Don't freeze on me, man.
[188:04.64]Can you follow me out here?
[188:07.95]If I keep going?
[188:09.05]Alright, we have to save after he's done with his little spiel.
[188:11.45]Hey, thank you Gunther for the one dollar.
[188:14.95]Please say...
[188:21.72]I ain't saying, no.
[188:23.88]No one's paying me money anymore to say the F word to somebody, because I don't know who it is.
[188:27.14]I'm... You're not gonna, I can't, I'm not, I refuse to take any money to say the F word to somebody that's apparently your friend.
[188:35.75]What?
[188:45.60]I still didn't get the flamethrower.
[188:47.60]We need to get to the radio building.
[188:49.70]We can call from there.
[188:51.22]You'll keep me safe?
[188:52.80]Let's go.
[188:54.14]F-word, yeah.
[188:55.16]If you don't know what the F-word is, it's F-U-C-K.
[188:58.34]Can't say it out loud, though.
[189:01.95]I didn't see anything.
[189:03.47]They were just going around.
[189:07.71]I guess it looks safe now.
[189:09.77]Come on, this way.
[189:12.59]You know what the magic hour is?
[189:14.27]Lots of healing.
[189:14.93]When the sun's over the horizon, but it's still light out.
[189:18.53]Some people call it the twilight, but I call it the magic hour.
[189:22.73]I guess it looks safe now.
[189:24.83]Come on, this way.
[189:27.67]God damn it, dude.
[189:28.53]Let go.
[189:30.61]Save.
[189:31.59]Now we're good.
[189:32.75]We're good for a while.
[189:33.83]We're gonna be fine.
[189:42.28]Come on, just like it's... You know, I always hate when that happens in Minecraft.
[189:45.90]I swear to God.
[189:48.18]You know, when the... When the sun comes up in Minecraft, right?
[189:54.64]And the monsters outside don't die.
[189:59.34]Like, fix your game, Notch.
[190:01.80]It's a disaster.
[190:04.79]What are you supposed to do when you're in a nightmare and you just can't wake up?
[190:09.43]It's like I woke from a dream and everything beautiful is gone.
[190:16.68]So he stays up here then.
[190:24.04]Oh shit, no, don't go down.
[190:24.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:26.98]Excuse me.
[190:28.86]I did this last time.
[190:32.37]Sounds like I regularly play it.
[190:33.75]I haven't played Minecraft in probably three years.
[190:37.27]Longer than that.
[190:38.21]This is the same exact reload animation as McCree in Overwatch.
[190:44.27]Look at this.
[190:44.79]Watch this.
[191:02.91]Somebody call the fire department.
[191:04.79]Let's go!
[191:05.03]Baseball!
[191:05.45]My favorite sport!
[191:06.52]What are you talking about?
[191:08.56]I'm here to play?
[191:33.09]Can I open the door next to him?
[191:34.53]I ain't going out there.
[191:35.95]Those devils, they just keep on coming right into the yard.
[191:40.61]We gotta get rid of them, or we'll never make it to the radio building.
[191:43.40]We'll just walk them into the light.
[191:44.42]Those creatures don't like it.
[191:46.44]If you could use that, you'd like to do it before.
[191:50.90]Stay in the light.
[191:52.08]Stay in the light.
[191:53.82]Oh, Don Piano.
[191:57.15]What did I ever do to deserve this?
[191:59.37]No.
[192:01.45]Oh, turn.
[192:03.70]They're just unloading the machine guns on him.
[192:05.80]Ow.
[192:15.01]Am I seriously dead?
[192:19.01]Did I just fucking die?
[192:29.96]We're gonna call for help.
[192:31.22]Come on.
[192:34.45]Why is there another enemy?
[192:35.39]Do you hear it?
[192:36.87]Oh.
[192:38.55]To get to the radio building, we gotta get into the yard.
[192:41.95]But hell, there's no way out of this town.
[192:44.41]Where do I end it?
[192:44.99]Just like up here?
[192:46.73]Like up there sounds like a good idea.
[192:48.13]Holy shit.
[192:54.64]Well...
[192:56.72]Why don't I just go back up the stairs?
[192:58.30]He's gonna die.
[192:59.87]I mean... Fucking stupid, dumb, idiot, asshole.
[193:09.98]I'm going to assume.
[193:10.56]This guy needs to climb back up the ladder with me.
[193:13.78]Yes.
[193:15.20]Okay.
[193:16.36]Stay up there.
[193:16.76]Stay on the ladder.
[193:17.38]Don't come down.
[193:18.46]Go up.
[193:40.59]Go up.
[193:41.93]Now you're just fucking with me, man.
[193:46.11]Alright, there we go.
[193:46.65]Here they come.
[193:53.92]Just aim the light at them.
[193:54.96]I actually don't think that they've come down here unless I aggro them.
[194:05.03]This is all so helpful.
[194:10.85]I don't know what this guy's thinking man.
[194:15.37]He's going through invisible doors
[194:40.79]These guys don't get hurt by the light.
[194:46.55]He's gonna die and we're gonna have to restart it He's still talking I'm honestly waiting for him to die so we can restart this stupid fucking thing
[195:17.64]He's not dying.
[195:22.65]Alright, dude, you know what?
[195:25.61]Just fuck it.
[195:26.05]This is not going to happen.
[195:36.27]Is it a kick?
[195:37.46]No, shoot!
[195:38.52]I won't hurt you.
[195:39.96]You ruined my life.
[195:42.90]You ruined my life.
[195:50.87]That was an interesting way to die.
[195:56.55]Alright, so I can't hurt those big guys.
[196:02.82]Big guys can't be hurt.
[196:05.16]Let's keep it right there.
[196:06.92]Head down, shoot this stupid thing.
[196:09.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[196:19.84]He did it!
[196:20.67]Nice job, man!
[196:22.63]Keep the Tommy gun out.
[196:23.45]So, what if I don't move?
[196:25.25]Last time I moved... I'm just trying to play ball!
[196:28.09]I was just trying to play ball.
[196:29.37]That's what was just happening.
[196:49.51]I gotta dodge here.
[196:52.73]Now this is where I have to be very careful.
[196:58.68]I gotta do this now.
[197:07.58]Before they start shooting.
[197:09.24]He's dead.
[197:10.03]Keep going.
[197:20.65]Sir, zigzag, zigzag, zigzag.
[197:26.35]You can dump him into the hole.
[197:27.22]You can throw him in the hole.
[197:31.54]I gotta turn back.
[197:45.03]Die!
[197:50.41]Shock on time?
[197:50.86]I think so.
[197:55.86]Well, Shock is insane against these guys.
[197:57.83]Are you kidding me?
[197:58.57]What?
[198:11.97]Very nice.
[198:13.09]Is that it?
[198:13.99]Or is there more?
[198:17.71]More, bring me to the light.
[198:20.33]Come here.
[198:24.30]That's the end of you.
[198:28.02]This looks easy.
[198:29.54]Once you figure out what you need to do.
[198:31.14]We gotta get out of here.
[198:32.86]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[198:34.56]No more flashlight, unfortunately.
[198:36.76]This is what I didn't want to miss.
[198:38.14]Somebody died over there with a gun.
[198:56.13]Some of the NPCs just don't follow.
[199:01.67]Better not be doing this shit.
[199:05.28]Let's go.
[199:08.70]There he goes.
[199:10.12]He figured out how to get off the ladder.
[199:11.34]Good for you.
[199:11.70]Let's go.
[199:14.89]This is Sparta.
[199:24.17]I know that funny video.
[199:28.21]I did that too.
[199:29.03]I made that joke too.
[199:30.45]In here.
[199:31.05]The radio's in here.
[199:32.05]Okay.
[199:39.81]Are you going to open the door or am I going to open the door?
[199:41.67]Alright, you're opening this door.
[199:45.09]The radio's already on.
[199:48.90]What's that sound coming over the speaker?
[199:51.88]It's like it's possessed or something.
[199:54.28]After all that, I'm still dead.
[199:57.32]I've got full healing here.
[199:59.38]Sometimes, I think you were the perfect father.
[200:03.28]Sometimes.
[200:05.01]It looks like interference is coming from the western part of the island.
[200:07.97]Oh, he did the voice.
[200:08.93]Oh, yeah, this one.
[200:09.87]That's gotta be from the old asylum.
[200:11.31]Hello, is that the telephone?
[200:12.79]The corrections officers go out there sometimes.
[200:14.65]I heard they set up an old radio so they could stay in touch with the abbots.
[200:18.77]Maybe that's what's caused the interference.
[200:22.12]Maybe it's something else.
[200:23.80]I always thought that place was haunted.
[200:28.38]You see, there's no way I'm leaving this building with things like this.
[200:31.26]Of course the phone is dead.
[200:32.64]So you're the ones gotta go to the asylum.
[200:35.62]Asylum?
[200:36.04]There's a map right there.
[200:37.30]You need to go through the old quarry to get there.
[200:39.49]You can get out of the prison by climbing up to the roof right above us and then jumping over to the digger's building.
[200:44.65]Okay.
[200:45.15]I'll stay here and keep the radio safe from those hobgoblins.
[200:54.13]First, yes or no, kill him.
[200:55.83]First thing I see.
[200:56.77]Literally yes or no.
[200:58.11]The first person that I see.
[201:00.39]The first thing I see.
[201:03.63]Don't.
[201:03.93]Okay.
[201:04.45]Done.
[201:06.17]It's gotta be yes or no.
[201:07.21]Okay.
[201:07.77]Good.
[201:07.99]We see now.
[201:08.31]Mm-hmm.
[201:19.94]Get out of here, you fool.
[201:21.40]What you waiting on?
[201:23.19]God damn it.
[201:24.27]Well, wait now.
[201:25.97]You got to get to the asylum.
[201:27.45]I got to get that other healing potion.
[201:29.27]It's not much of a chance, but it's all we got.
[201:34.72]Asylum.
[201:38.54]Asylum.
[201:42.71]Asylum.
[201:43.95]You gotta get to the asylum.
[201:46.21]Something's not right there.
[201:47.77]It's not much of a chance, but it's all we got.
[201:50.40]Get out of here, you fool.
[201:53.54]What you waiting on?
[201:54.42]I'm gonna shoot him.
[201:58.48]You gotta get to the asylum.
[202:00.24]Something's not right there.
[202:01.78]It's not much of a chance, but it's all we got.
[202:06.50]Go on and get to the asylum and figure out what's causing all this interference.
[202:10.92]Got no time to waste.
[202:13.12]I'll be here waiting all by myself, but I'll be OK.
[202:29.44]Don't need to drop down.
[202:32.94]Go on and get to the asylum and figure out what's causing all this interference.
[202:37.33]Oh, you... God damn it.
[202:38.25]Just... Bye.
[202:39.79]Bye.
[202:39.93]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[202:41.89]Just go.
[202:52.35]Go to the asylum.
[202:53.59]Oh, now it's going the right way.
[202:55.12]Good thing I got it replaced.
[202:56.28]There's lots of healing everywhere around here.
[203:08.24]Get out of here, you fool!
[203:09.88]What you waiting on?
[203:10.84]I have to go.
[203:11.46]I have to go.
[203:13.16]Go on and get to the asylum and figure out what's causing all this interference.
[203:17.01]We've got no time to waste.
[203:19.77]I'll be here waiting all by myself.
[203:21.87]But I'll be okay.
[203:24.97]Lock the door.
[203:25.89]Goodbye.
[203:27.01]It's been fun.
[203:28.27]How would he see me?
[203:29.47]I'll be here, waiting all by myself.
[203:30.99]But I'll be okay.
[203:32.67]You go.
[203:42.78]I know.
[203:44.68]I'm there.
[203:44.90]I'm going.
[203:45.24]I'm going.
[203:45.74]I'm going.
[203:46.20]I'm going.
[203:46.68]See, I didn't kill him.
[203:47.90]I was a good guy for once.
[203:49.32]That's a lot of people.
[204:15.62]Climb.
[204:17.73]Climb.
[204:18.81]Plummy gun.
[204:19.39]There's a lot of shit.
[204:26.67]They're preparing me for something.
[204:29.26]Right?
[204:29.90]Hey.
[204:31.32]Oh, shoot.
[204:36.70]Guy almost got me.
[204:38.71]Almost.
[204:42.29]easy Oh dodge that one
[205:13.68]That's almost it.
[205:14.88]Come on.
[205:19.78]Don't do this to me.
[205:22.24]Where'd you go?
[205:24.40]There's this guy again.
[205:33.00]Flash, bang, grenade.
[205:39.60]I do want to go up here and look.
[205:46.78]So, I'm just going to check in with you guys and see how you guys are doing.
[205:49.76]How are you guys enjoying the stream?
[205:54.06]That was superhuman.
[205:56.20]Force jump.
[206:00.11]Just checking in with you guys.
[206:01.05]How are you guys enjoying the stream so far?
[206:03.27]If you like it, then do me a favor and click on that follow button.
[206:12.68]Hopefully you guys are having a good time.
[206:20.69]Been here for 15 seconds, so far so good.
[206:24.71]Excellent, excellent.
[206:26.37]That's what I love to hear.
[206:32.14]If you don't want to follow the stream, you know what I mean?
[206:35.08]That's fine.
[206:36.84]Follow the goddamn stream.
[206:42.68]Got it.
[206:49.16]Hey, this guy.
[206:50.37]You gonna follow the stream, buddy?
[206:52.19]I don't think so.
[206:53.33]No, he ain't.
[206:56.45]I'm not tall enough to hit him.
[207:03.53]Let's go with this.
[207:06.15]No, I'm just kidding.
[207:06.74]If you like the stream, you like it.
[207:08.46]If you don't, you don't.
[207:09.04]It's fine.
[207:15.16]I'll never tell anybody to do anything.
[207:17.32]I'll never tell anybody to follow me.
[207:23.23]Maryland.
[207:25.71]Is this what Maryland's going to look like in a few years?
[207:27.85]Well, this is the entrance to a haunted house.
[207:38.66]This would be a really cool haunted house entrance.
[207:40.30]Hmm.
[207:48.75]I'm not tall enough to touch the ground.
[207:52.49]Don't bury me.
[207:55.11]Don't bury me.
[207:59.89]This one looks like it can be opened.
[208:04.03]I guess not.
[208:07.99]Close the game.
[208:08.57]It got too scary.
[208:09.55]Whose name is on here?
[208:11.43]Nobody.
[208:15.15]There's a wheelbarrow.
[208:18.12]There's a wheelbarrow here.
[208:21.32]Looks like we just go straight on.
[208:27.00]Mm-hmm.
[208:28.14]There's no digging.
[208:30.78]This is not just an LED.
[208:32.64]Why would I shoot the shotgun twice at that?
[208:34.28]But I'm here now.
[208:35.22]I'm here!
[208:45.28]Oh no, my family.
[208:46.64]It was just a couple of rocks.
[208:51.43]Honey, I love what you've done with your hair.
[208:53.27]I didn't mean to shoot.
[208:57.11]The joke's over.
[208:58.27]God damn it.
[208:59.25]Just rewind.
[209:01.48]Cut it here.
[209:02.62]Cut the clip here.
[209:03.82]Like, ready?
[209:04.66]No!
[209:06.08]Oh, they were just a bunch of rocks.
[209:08.40]Oh man.
[209:10.60]Honey, I love what you've done with your hair.
[209:13.93]It died at green.
[209:15.53]It looks real good on you.
[209:17.75]Junior.
[209:19.05]You're growing up so fast.
[209:22.05]Mary!
[209:25.05]I fucked it up.
[209:26.31]I'm about to throw myself off the goddamn clicker.
[209:28.11]You know what?
[209:28.41]I am.
[209:38.46]Whatever.
[209:40.80]You know what I was gonna do there.
[209:42.28]And like... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209:45.49]I got all messed up.
[209:46.97]We'll fix it in post.
[209:47.95]Don't worry.
[209:52.93]We'll fix it in post.
[209:53.89]Just magic of editing will make that look real good.
[209:57.61]TNT stick!
[210:00.35]How does that work?
[210:09.74]It's a really short fuse.
[210:20.91]Okay.
[210:22.01]Alright, I'm done.
[210:28.65]Let's go.
[210:31.69]Tommy gun.
[210:32.91]TNT.
[210:34.25]I'm Dino-Mite.
[210:36.37]TNT, and I'm in the fight.
[210:40.23]TNT.
[210:41.07]It's Dino-Mite.
[210:44.21]TNT.
[210:44.77]And I'm in the fight.
[210:49.65]Am I supposed to go down here?
[210:57.48]What an odd voice the guy from ACDC has.
[211:00.84]Think about that.
[211:01.48]Try to do it.
[211:02.22]It's not possible.
[211:05.01]If I talked like this for more than nine seconds, it would be a problem.
[211:18.97]Wait, what?
[211:31.75]Why would you still be shooting me?
[211:34.13]Can I shoot these guys or am I gonna get the bad ending?
[211:39.33]I don't care what ending I get, guys.
[211:41.21]That's what you don't understand.
[211:47.13]Chaotic neutral.
[211:48.87]That's where I would be on the alignment charts.
[211:51.51]He does what he does for the greater good.
[211:53.61]But also, plays by his own fucking rules.
[212:05.27]Chaotic neutral.
[212:08.52]And then he, after a long days of work, he's finishing up with some Sprite.
[212:19.52]That's chaotic good.
[212:21.36]No, I'm chaotic neutral.
[212:25.24]I don't, chaotic good is like, everybody says that they're, look, everybody with like a D&D pad calls themselves chaotic good because they're like, I'm the Joker.
[212:36.65]Everybody and their grandmother wants to say that they're chaotic good because it's like, I do whatever I want.
[212:41.95]I play by my own rules, but I'm still a good guy.
[212:49.49]You know, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[212:50.55]All of you in chat, everybody here.
[212:55.75]Everybody wants to be the interesting guy.
[212:57.65]Nobody wants to be lawful evil.
[212:59.67]Nobody wants to be lawful, like, nobody wants to be, like, neutral.
[213:03.48]Everybody wants to be chaotic eat good.
[213:05.14]I don't even know what I would actually be.
[213:15.77]I would be chaotic eat good.
[213:20.23]No, no, no.
[213:21.02]I would be neutral evil.
[213:27.46]Where is he?
[213:31.60]Dead?
[213:32.09]Good.
[213:34.19]I would be like lawful chaotic... No.
[213:36.49]I would actually... You know what I... Really?
[213:38.63]I would be lawful chaotic good.
[213:41.94]Because I play by all the rules.
[213:44.24]I don't do anything illegal.
[213:46.10]I just do it very poorly and very haphazardly and kind of all over the place.
[213:50.94]So I play by the rules.
[213:53.49]When I play by the rules, I drop a couple of eggs.
[213:56.59]And I might actually... Something might happen to somebody.
[214:00.37]But I'm going for the greater good.
[214:05.14]Even the guy in the game could not take my shit.
[214:07.84]He was so angry.
[214:08.94]He was like, shut up!
[214:15.05]So, neutral good.
[214:15.81]No, chaotic, neutral, evil, bad.
[214:18.70]Have you seen these TNT sticks yet?
[214:27.66]This looks like a house I drew.
[214:34.84]So, just stupid.
[214:35.81]Stupid!
[214:36.73]Excuse me.
[214:43.13]What are these, like, bugs?
[214:47.85]good yeah guys I'm awful evil I'm awful good can I get up here I don't think that's gonna be dangerous if I fall awful good oh give that guy a fucking give that guy a give that guy a ribbon
[215:19.01]Why can I not go on this ladder?
[215:21.21]Get on the ladder!
[215:21.79]Okay, apparently I didn't need it.
[215:34.56]I'm an anti-hero.
[215:37.00]Have to do what's right.
[215:40.73]Oh, oh boy.
[215:52.22]Whoa, is that the same guy?
[215:57.90]That guy was actually frozen.
[216:00.43]Like, I thought I was a T-Rex.
[216:06.79]Oh, come on.
[216:09.73]Shotgun, best weapon, GG.
[216:16.90]See, right now I'm acting very chaotic evil.
[216:20.77]I'm not giving anybody a chance.
[216:21.77]This is chaotic good right here.
[216:24.29]That's, you know, okay, let's go over weapons, right?
[216:27.11]The shotgun.
[216:28.69]The shotgun is a chaotic good weapon.
[216:32.67]Right?
[216:33.11]You shoot it, the spread is all over the place.
[216:34.97]It's chaotic.
[216:35.99]You can't really aim it that well.
[216:37.13]It's chaotic.
[216:38.56]But, it's a very, very effective weapon.
[216:40.86]It's good.
[216:41.30]It's very good at what it does.
[216:43.42]Now, the rifle, the single-shot rifle, on the other hand, is more lawful good.
[216:50.15]plays by the rules, it's very precise, and it gets the job done.
[216:56.05]Now, for instance, a grenade would be chaotic evil.
[217:01.33]Fucking stupid asshole.
[217:02.79]Shut the fuck up and play the game.
[217:06.86]I just dumped shit all over my desk.
[217:08.98]Can this guy come up, please?
[217:17.60]That was good...
[217:24.27]A grenade is chaotic evil.
[217:27.09]So, you know, a grenade is a huge explosion, it can't be controlled, it's all over the place.
[217:33.66]It's just like, boom!
[217:34.76]You don't know what's gonna happen.
[217:36.60]Something horrible could happen.
[217:39.86]Now, lawful evil, on the other hand, would be a knife.
[217:42.95]Wouldn't it?
[217:44.15]Because that's very precise, very, very... You stab people, like, in the stomach, in the neck, it's terrible.
[217:49.91]Evil, evil process of, like, slitting somebody's throat.
[217:52.47]Knife is lawful evil.
[217:59.01]A true neutral weapon?
[218:03.21]JJ and Stevie, your two hands.
[218:05.79]True neutral.
[218:09.10]What?
[218:13.10]What's going on?
[218:16.22]What just happened?
[218:20.20]What the fuck just happened?
[218:21.36]Did I just kill this guy?
[218:26.52]Wait, hold on.
[218:28.36]Should I not have done that?
[218:29.28]I don't even know how... Enemy.
[218:43.19]That hurts a lot.
[218:45.97]Worm carousel.
[218:47.07]That's great.
[218:48.89]Can I at least have his dynamite?
[218:52.02]I have too much dynamite.
[218:53.38]So let's get rid of some.
[219:01.04]Nice.
[219:06.60]Nice.
[219:08.47]That was cool.
[219:09.83]Alright, moving on.
[219:12.29]I'm gonna keep it equipped.
[219:13.57]Feel like I can use it at some point.
[219:19.23]Get up there.
[219:21.17]Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[219:21.91]I wanna go down here.
[219:22.49]Looks like there could be something secret.
[219:28.81]No.
[219:29.47]Just a hole that exists for no reason.
[219:37.21]Laughing.
[219:38.35]Laughing.
[219:38.91]Who's laughing at me?
[219:39.85]I don't like when people laugh at me.
[219:40.97]What am I, a clown to you?
[219:43.65]What do you think I am, a clown?
[219:44.83]Is that why you're laughing?
[219:45.91]Funny how.
[219:48.75]Sorry, Mr. Pesci.
[219:51.67]I got in a weird mood.
[219:53.81]I got in a weird mood.
[219:54.79]I did.
[220:01.21]Oh, God.
[220:01.73]Okay, here we go again.
[220:02.77]Okay, note to self.
[220:10.54]Do not throw... Do not throw TNT in a random spot.
[220:22.67]No, throw TNT, actually.
[220:35.22]Jesus.
[220:43.04]I actually just got that guy with a perfect toss.
[220:45.31]Radio.
[220:45.65]Okay, we're good.
[220:53.05]What a good horror game this is.
[220:54.63]This is The Suffering, right?
[220:59.29]I'm not touching any more buttons.
[221:02.94]Until I understand what this is.
[221:08.23]I'm about to, like, Wile E. Coyote, Acme, do something.
[221:11.35]What is this gonna do?
[221:18.41]What?
[221:25.42]Hold on a second.
[221:30.42]What?
[221:31.24]Why would you do... Stop it!
[221:32.56]Don't... Okay.
[221:35.21]Um...
[221:38.96]That is, uh, that is, that sure is swell.
[221:42.76]That's swell.
[221:47.08]So, why would I want to press that button?
[221:55.55]The suffering.
[222:00.87]Don't stand near it.
[222:02.49]Where's the last guy?
[222:03.95]Okay, so... So, what happened?
[222:07.42]Can I move this?
[222:09.89]This has to be here for a reason.
[222:13.63]No, don't!
[222:14.19]I didn't want to do that.
[222:15.21]I guess I did want to do that.
[222:23.32]Okay.
[222:24.18]Well... Something behind there.
[222:29.96]No.
[222:30.84]I think that was just teaching me to blow something up.
[222:33.68]Oh, shit!
[222:34.76]You think anybody will care?
[222:37.37]Watch out!
[222:38.45]Cave in!
[222:39.71]You can't just leave us here!
[222:41.30]Fucking inmates.
[222:42.30]They're not worth the trouble.
[222:43.30]Let them rot.
[222:44.76]Who's- Who?
[222:48.74]I'm missing something here.
[222:49.74]Can I blow it up?
[222:52.62]No.
[222:53.45]I'm sneezing.
[223:04.17]You know a sneeze?
[223:05.66]A sneeze is chaotic good.
[223:08.38]Because you see, what a sneeze is doing, a sneeze is like a bunch of pressure coming out of your nasal passages, and it's just like, it's totally, totally an explosive thing that you can't control.
[223:17.46]But, it alleviates that pressure, and it makes you feel better, and it's one hundredth of a tenth of a... Where am I going?
[223:31.39]That was just mildly annoying.
[223:32.61]Okay.
[223:34.44]I can't move.
[223:37.00]What did I just climb onto?
[223:39.90]Okay.
[223:44.30]I guess I was just supposed to go this way.
[223:47.81]Got nine shots.
[223:53.55]Excuse me, Barry.
[224:01.10]Oh, nice arrows.
[224:04.76]Again, what's with all of the useless, useless, useless things?
[224:11.31]There's a lot of useless things in this game.
[224:13.83]All those flashbangs, and all the... Well, I know what to do about this.
[224:21.71]TNT.
[224:22.97]Somebody else, somebody bring TNT at me.
[224:33.76]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[224:36.12]That was a direct hit.
[224:47.59]Oh, come on.
[224:48.53]And I just dropped one on the ground.
[224:52.13]What?
[224:52.65]Huh?
[225:06.82]I need to save this right now.
[225:19.22]I'm running out.
[225:19.78]I got to start to use the revolvers.
[225:21.04]I'm going to get collapsed on and these things are going to break and I'm going to explode.
[225:25.22]Watch this.
[225:25.56]I'm going to back up into this shit and it's going to come off.
[225:29.12]I knew it.
[225:32.98]Watch this, he's going to ruin everything.
[225:36.69]I have to get rid of this now.
[225:37.87]Like, right now.
[225:39.47]What are you- Ah!
[225:53.06]He's still alive.
[226:02.42]Health, please.
[226:03.94]This game's getting too scary for me.
[226:05.52]What do I even have left of bullets?
[226:13.53]I'm running very low.
[226:15.29]Is this the end of the game?
[226:21.75]How many questions am I going to ask?
[226:22.61]Is this the end of the game?
[226:24.86]How many bullets do I have?
[226:26.40]What the hell is it?
[226:33.18]Not today.
[226:35.16]Not today.
[226:36.22]Not today.
[226:36.68]Not today.
[226:37.16]Not today.
[226:37.64]Come on.
[226:39.86]Give me something besides TNT.
[226:42.23]Thank you.
[226:50.45]Oh, man.
[226:53.75]If they weren't so close, I would throw a grenade.
[226:56.58]But they're just forever right here.
[227:09.07]Oh!
[227:09.81]Oh!
[227:10.61]Do it!
[227:14.91]Is that it?
[227:26.92]Okay, there's healing over here.
[227:30.72]I think I'm good.
[227:36.79]I think.
[227:37.37]Where was that healing?
[227:37.95]There's like two pill bottles over here.
[227:41.55]Oh, fucking whatever.
[227:44.55]Screw this guy.
[227:48.57]Ah!
[227:50.15]Leave me alone.
[227:54.49]Let me just take a minute.
[227:55.85]I don't have a minute.
[227:58.79]Back to the dual revolvers.
[228:00.33]Dual revolvers.
[228:05.39]What are you doing?
[228:06.03]Move.
[228:07.65]What the?
[228:08.25]What?
[228:08.85]What are you?
[228:09.43]Why?
[228:11.79]Huh?
[228:13.61]Almost out of Tommy gun bullets.
[228:48.41]What do you mean, what am I doing?
[228:50.97]I'm clearing the level.
[228:58.32]Of all the filth.
[229:11.85]This is getting a little ridiculous.
[229:14.93]This is ridiculous.
[229:17.11]This is ridiculous.
[229:18.27]This is just ridiculous.
[229:23.13]He's still alive, isn't he?
[229:24.55]No.
[229:25.11]Took me long enough.
[229:27.66]I can climb.
[229:28.32]No, I can't.
[229:33.54]Damn it.
[229:35.82]Chaotic?
[229:36.52]Awful.
[229:36.86]No, it's awful.
[229:37.74]It's awful good.
[229:39.24]Awfully good.
[229:42.79]Awful evil.
[229:45.05]They're coming out of here.
[229:47.07]Alright, it's time to Mordor this shit.
[229:55.90]Mordor!
[229:58.71]I think I just have to jump it.
[230:15.17]Mm-hmm.
[230:16.15]That's fine.
[230:16.67]Keep following me.
[230:19.51]That's fine.
[230:20.23]Just keep following me.
[230:21.70]I'm not gonna be angry.
[230:24.06]In fact... Say hello to the devil for me.
[230:31.87]I'm gonna take a second here just to say that that was a perfect throw.
[230:36.07]That could not have gone any better.
[230:38.33]Yet they're all still alive.
[230:45.24]I gotta jump the hole!
[230:45.92]Jump the hole!
[230:46.73]What am I- What am I supposed to do?
[230:55.43]Climb up?
[230:56.79]Didn't I just come from here?
[231:00.75]No, I don't remember the house.
[231:01.79]So what- What a shitty house.
[231:15.70]Okay.
[231:16.84]So, where... Throw it in the hole?
[231:21.23]That's what I did before.
[231:21.95]I didn't do anything.
[231:22.55]Look.
[231:26.21]It just shakes the screen.
[231:30.08]Over there?
[231:30.64]I think I'm just going to go over there.
[231:33.36]Alright, yeah.
[231:33.98]We're going to go back this way.
[231:34.96]So don't die.
[231:35.52]I hope this doesn't kill me.
[231:47.80]God-forsaken way like really This right here Go into the hole I can't go in the hole the hole makes me throw up and turns me around I can't jump in the hole Like I have to go like around here I
[232:25.38]I tried eating the hole.
[232:28.53]What am I missing here?
[232:29.31]I gotta move... Don't even tell me I have to, like, move a lamp.
[232:33.39]Hold on.
[232:38.79]Is this... Do you have to do something with this?
[232:40.11]Like a generator?
[232:43.83]What am I doing?
[232:49.69]Ooh, come on.
[232:51.71]New construction.
[232:52.85]Wow.
[232:55.02]Good work.
[232:57.16]Now take a break.
[232:58.34]Take five.
[233:03.92]Hold on, wait.
[233:05.98]Okay, let's see if I can throw a grenade from here.
[233:07.83]Just go over the hole.
[233:10.07]Hole's been cleansed.
[233:12.51]Boink-a-rino.
[233:14.25]Boink!
[233:19.63]Just like that.
[233:21.11]That's how you do it.
[233:26.76]Reload the 37 shotgun bullets.
[233:31.95]And keep going.
[233:36.67]Another crane.
[233:37.53]Another hole to fill.
[233:43.61]Polygon pills.
[233:47.21]Just don't miss anything over here.
[233:52.43]Plenty of revolver ammo.
[233:53.93]Just don't need it.
[233:56.01]It's the worst gun in the game.
[233:57.49]Okay.
[234:00.01]I think it's safe to say we can go down here.
[234:05.86]That's good.
[234:07.72]Tommy gun.
[234:09.38]Okay.
[234:14.50]Everything's full.
[234:16.60]And... Don't.
[234:18.38]Just blow it up before I cause a problem.
[234:20.38]Honestly.
[234:33.66]Delayed explosion?
[234:35.50]Delayed release tablets?
[234:38.56]What the fuck?
[234:43.56]Why did that happen?
[234:45.50]They all blew up.
[234:52.19]No.
[234:52.77]No.
[234:53.17]Um, no.
[234:54.41]I don't think so.
[234:56.13]I don't think so.
[234:58.87]Let's skip this, okay?
[235:00.09]That was cool.
[235:03.62]Alright, that was fun.
[235:06.16]I don't care about any... No, there's health down here.
[235:11.26]Just get the items and leave.
[235:13.09]Damn it, that's so... Save them this time.
[235:21.33]They die instantly.
[235:24.96]How am I supposed to save them?
[235:30.24]That gets us over here.
[235:31.26]Free shit in here.
[235:33.30]Revolvers, yeah.
[235:34.76]Make the jump, get the stuff.
[235:37.10]And this time... This time, let's make this a little more clean.
[235:42.26]I'm going to stay up here.
[235:44.75]So there's no chance that that will screw up.
[235:53.61]Okay.
[235:55.11]Are you done exploding?
[235:56.09]Okay.
[235:59.26]Press the button.
[236:01.64]Wow.
[236:03.75]You did it.
[236:05.21]Five points.
[236:07.27]Okay, go.
[236:12.87]You are so strong.
[236:14.49]They suffocated in there.
[236:21.00]They just let him die.
[236:22.62]If anybody knows what that is, we're stuck.
[236:25.30]It's too good for those fuckers.
[236:27.20]Let's get them alive.
[236:33.00]Whoa!
[236:34.42]Alright.
[236:35.61]That's too old.
[236:39.71]That guy, he shoots in every direction.
[236:42.53]Let's get me out of here.
[236:54.67]Well, this is a room full of shit.
[236:58.99]Oh!
[237:00.53]No!
[237:01.37]No, don't just... I understand what's happening.
[237:03.57]I understand what's happening now.
[237:17.16]I'm safe in here as long as I don't come out.
[237:27.44]Okay.
[237:31.33]Where?
[237:33.53]How many are out here?
[237:46.38]These things are the worst.
[237:54.21]Oh, come on!
[238:04.63]I had to reload the fucking gun.
[238:06.45]Oh, I'm so angry.
[238:07.63]I'm unreasonably mad.
[238:10.25]Don't die.
[238:17.31]Go away.
[238:18.89]Go away.
[238:20.35]Go away.
[238:25.76]I lost seven healing there.
[238:27.50]Like seven.
[238:29.50]Seven.
[238:31.35]That should have never happened.
[238:32.47]I should have just kept running.
[238:33.79]Ay, ay.
[238:36.89]These stupid little assholes.
[238:46.14]Every enemy takes a thousand rounds to die in this game.
[238:49.16]Just by... What's the point of shooting those guys if it takes like nine shotgun shots to kill them?
[238:55.76]I don't see a reason.
[238:56.80]I don't see a point.
[238:57.54]What's the point of doing that?
[238:59.18]Why did I do that for so long?
[239:07.88]Now what?
[239:11.50]Fucking Bugs Bunny.
[239:23.13]Nah, which way is Albuquerque?
[239:25.71]You bugs.
[239:31.05]I can't do this right now.
[239:35.86]Oh my lord.
[239:41.22]And so am I. So am I, as you can see.
[239:45.42]I'm having trouble too.
[239:46.44]I'm fucking kidding you.
[239:57.73]I need to get to that ledge there.
[239:59.49]What?
[239:59.69]What's going on?
[240:00.29]They suffocated in there.
[240:05.31]Gotta get payback.
[240:06.01]It's too good for those fuckers.
[240:07.43]Let's get them alive.
[240:08.44]Dude.
[240:10.80]I'm just going to run.
[240:11.42]I'm going to collect all the shit that's around here.
[240:13.62]And then I'm going to go.
[240:17.36]This is dumb.
[240:18.22]This is dumb.
[240:28.24]I saw how many I just threw.
[240:30.34]That was dynamite.
[240:32.02]That was dynamite.
[240:36.61]You know what?
[240:39.97]Not happening again.
[240:40.99]I'm gonna die.
[240:41.95]Little assholes.
[241:14.74]Can we all fuck off now?
[241:16.18]Can that be it?
[241:19.58]I would really appreciate it if I could have a second here and just move on with the game.
[241:24.07]I would love it.
[241:25.93]I just like it a lot.
[241:29.07]Use the stab.
[241:30.75]Maybe.
[241:34.00]Around here is the hey dude guys over here.
[241:45.63]And I did the stab.
[241:46.35]Does everyone want me to stab these guys?
[241:49.73]When I get extra points?
[241:52.77]Oh.
[241:56.70]Oh.
[242:09.22]I guess I got the extra points.
[242:10.79]Yo, bro!
[242:12.29]Over here!
[242:13.85]Over here!
[242:17.87]Yeah?
[242:19.07]What's up?
[242:21.02]Dude!
[242:23.96]I'm trapped!
[242:24.96]So what do you want me to do?
[242:28.50]Can I, like, have him jump to this?
[242:29.62]Alright, jump!
[242:32.45]Thanks, bro!
[242:40.82]I was trying to kill him.
[242:42.32]And I got a good grade for that one.
[242:48.42]I was trying to let that guy fall.
[242:50.58]And I got called a good person for it.
[242:52.96]That's what I'm talking about.
[242:54.90]Chaotic.
[242:55.82]Lawful chaotic e-troll.
[243:02.77]Uh-oh.
[243:03.53]Have you ever seen The Shining?
[243:04.61]Those two girls!
[243:09.26]Redrob!
[243:09.76]Redrob!
[243:11.80]Oh, awful chaotic stupid.
[243:24.71]Uh-oh.
[243:27.01]We're gonna have to fight the scarecrow monster.
[243:34.58]Magic is real.
[243:43.66]Oh.
[243:44.82]Okay.
[243:46.92]Never mind.
[243:47.30]I thought they were going to give me like an elaborate monster thing.
[243:51.12]Whatever, I don't know.
[243:57.48]What the hell do you want me to do here?
[243:59.59]I have to aim the water, right?
[244:02.05]Do I have to scoop up water?
[244:05.23]I definitely have to scoop water up.
[244:07.25]There's no way I'm not going to need to scoop up water.
[244:12.76]Scooped it up.
[244:13.32]That's my water that I scooped.
[244:19.82]Easy peasy.
[244:30.13]Cool.
[244:34.47]Lawful Resident Evil.
[244:40.22]That's not a bad title.
[244:44.23]for this inevitable video.
[244:56.52]I see your problem's not with the carburetor.
[244:59.72]It's the fact that you're...
[245:15.35]You fill in the blanks, whatever.
[245:18.45]Bill Clinton.
[245:19.77]See, the problem is not with your carburetor.
[245:22.36]It's the fact that you can't drive.
[245:24.78]You're a fool.
[245:31.12]You don't even have a license.
[245:37.76]What a weirdo.
[245:43.63]Hmm, we're seeing the same environment over and over and over again until we forget that it's a lie.
[245:51.15]But what do we have left once we abandon the car?
[245:56.95]Gonna have to walk.
[246:01.49]Boss?
[246:01.95]Whoa!
[246:02.73]Health!
[246:03.21]What happened to my health?
[246:05.39]What?
[246:05.65]Okay, if I stand still, I regen.
[246:14.26]No, I don't.
[246:15.35]That's so annoying.
[246:18.11]There's going to be like a monster here.
[246:19.45]It's going to be like an alligator.
[246:20.73]Oh, we were so cute together.
[246:22.21]Who are these guys?
[246:49.48]Well, they've had it at a swamp level.
[246:52.59]Get out of here.
[246:54.05]Stab it, right?
[246:56.41]I thought you guys told me to stab.
[246:58.99]Why I stabbed on an instant kill?
[247:01.80]You fucking liars.
[247:03.10]Unbelievable.
[247:03.74]And it worked.
[247:04.34]It actually worked.
[247:04.96]Because that guy had no health the last time.
[247:07.24]Unbelievable.
[247:10.57]Truly, truly unbelievable.
[247:25.34]Stabbed him for an instant kill.
[247:32.11]That ain't happening.
[247:32.89]That's not how it works.
[247:40.32]I'm gonna go, oof.
[247:42.40]Oof.
[247:43.88]Oof.
[247:47.11]Ah, I had it too.
[247:47.97]I had it chained right there, but I didn't get it right.
[247:51.51]Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
[247:59.91]This is not, we're not playing that game anymore.
[248:01.81]I can't make this joke.
[248:10.79]So did I. So there was no reason to come up here.
[248:15.19]What did I just get?
[248:15.82]Carnate Island map.
[248:24.14]Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[248:27.44]I'm starving.
[248:29.39]I don't want to do that again.
[248:34.35]I think I'm getting tired.
[248:37.35]Because that's making me laugh.
[248:40.63]Using the tired excuse?
[248:41.43]Eh, I guess I am.
[248:48.78]It actually is getting late though.
[248:55.26]It is midnight.
[249:11.43]Ooh, I found another secret!
[249:13.83]Dr. Killjoy put this sharp thing in my head, and I'm so happy now.
[249:19.35]So happy.
[249:20.81]Wrong button!
[249:28.59]Ah, ah, okay.
[249:35.74]That was such an overreaction, by the way.
[249:46.07]Where am I going?
[249:51.94]Did I find it?
[249:52.74]I think I found it.
[249:54.58]I found the castle.
[250:00.12]Or have I already been here?
[250:04.40]Yeah, this is where I need to be.
[250:07.44]We're gonna go inside the mansion.
[250:10.27]Resident Evil.
[250:15.80]Don't tell me it's already handy.
[250:29.55]And hi-ya!
[250:32.41]Perfect throw.
[250:35.63]Yes, Alex, I'll take a perfect throw for 400, please.
[250:39.79]That's a daily double!
[250:49.33]Shit.
[250:50.55]I've still got it.
[250:59.82]Really?
[251:01.68]No, these guys have to go, because I have to move the other thing over here.
[251:09.96]Push.
[251:10.76]No.
[251:11.40]Come on.
[251:11.78]Really?
[251:11.98]There's another one still here?
[251:15.01]Or is that just there to trick me?
[251:19.72]How many fucking enemies are here?
[251:29.34]I guess you could throw it in there.
[251:37.29]Just grab it.
[251:38.15]Come on, I want to move on here.
[251:44.40]Okay, well, then pull it this way.
[251:52.76]And we are inside the manor.
[251:59.63]So I'm probably going to...
[252:08.69]I'm probably going to call it quits in a moment here.
[252:11.53]For tonight.
[252:12.09]Maybe in, like, another, like, half an hour or so.
[252:14.27]Maybe.
[252:32.49]And I will be your alienist this fine evening.
[252:35.13]Welcome to the Carnate Institution for the Tragically Tra- Okay, well, that looks like it's going to be now.
[252:43.35]Thank you everybody for watching.
[252:44.43]This has been The Suffering.
[252:47.38]It's a horror survival action third-person game.
[252:52.96]And it sure is fun.
[252:55.08]If you have a chance to play it, why not?
[252:56.92]It's an old one.
[252:57.46]It's a good one.
[252:59.17]That is where that's going to stop, apparently.
[253:03.29]uh yeah so tomorrow tomorrow we're going to continue I really did not think I was going to be enjoying this game as much as I did so we kind of like played this game for like four hours I really thought this was going to be like open it up and it sucks and 20 midnight like this was like this was cool this was fun it was all over the place and it was worth playing
[253:28.46]So I don't think... We're not going to continue this tomorrow.
[253:31.96]We have a lot of horror games to play.
[253:35.06]And we're probably going to start tomorrow with... I don't know.
[253:41.90]There's a lot.
[253:44.00]I want to play... Phantasmagoria is one that I have that is just outrageous that I'd like to play on stream tomorrow.
[253:50.76]That's what we're going to start with.
[253:52.80]I also have... God, I have like 10 games.
[253:57.77]So it's possible that you'll see some odd shit tomorrow.
[254:04.77]Streamed in 10 dogs.
[254:07.17]I mean, I have to, honestly, I have to be like fairly close to the end of this game.
[254:13.67]But there can't be more than like another two or three hours in the suffering, right?
[254:16.87]I don't know.
[254:19.21]Maybe we'll go back to this after like Phantasmagoria if it's like, I don't know.
[254:22.70]There's a lot.
[254:23.26]There's a lot to do.
[254:24.70]I haven't made my decision yet, but it's been fun.
[254:28.24]I still have no access to my mouse, so I can't even turn the stream off.
[254:34.08]Yes, I don't.
[254:35.59]Wherever that might be.
[254:39.69]Okay.
[254:40.77]I have access again.
[254:46.65]So anyways, that's going to wrap it up.
[254:49.33]So let's go ahead and move this.
[254:51.83]No, that's wrong.
[254:56.36]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[254:58.11]I know it's kind of late.
[254:59.15]We started late as well, but we went for over four hours.
[255:06.71]I also, like, I want to be able to rest up tonight.
[255:09.83]Because, uh, after getting back from TwitchCon, I've got, like, the TwitchCon throat.
[255:16.65]Where my nasal passages are kind of hurt, and I can feel a sore throat brewing.
[255:22.08]And I don't want it to turn into anything.
[255:24.20]So, I'm just, like, taking in vitamins, eating good, and trying to get a good amount of sleep so it doesn't turn into an actual cold.
[255:30.40]Or a sickness.
[255:32.48]I got the con virus.
[255:35.53]But, thank you so much.
[255:37.15]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[255:38.37]We'll be starting again, like, hopefully around, like, the normal time tomorrow.
[255:43.39]Because it just took a while to install everything.
[255:45.71]And, like, to get patches for games that didn't work.
[255:48.39]So, see you tomorrow.
[255:50.11]7 o'clock.
[255:50.85]Let me catch up on some bits that came in over the last 40 minutes or so.
[255:55.86]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[255:58.16]Uh, hey, Sergeant Mars, thanks for the bits.
[255:59.87]Playing Nintendogs next.
[256:01.15]Well, that's not a horror game.
[256:02.85]That's a fun, cute, look-at-the-dog game.
[256:06.40]That's for, like, a different time.
[256:07.36]That's for, like, the spring.
[256:10.24]In the springtime, we'll play some, like, dog games, and we'll have a lot of fun and be happy.
[256:14.22]But thank you for the, uh, two dollars there, because you said that twice.
[256:17.54]Playing in ten dogs, playing in ten dogs.
[256:19.78]No, maybe I will.
[256:21.38]SticksRenegade, thank you for the three dollars and forty-two cents and bits.
[256:26.67]Having trouble.
[256:28.07]The singer doesn't sing for ACDC anymore.
[256:30.57]He had to stop due to the risk of hearing loss.
[256:33.99]Axl Rose sings for ACDC now.
[256:36.07]God, why?
[256:36.67]Wait, really?
[256:38.82]Wait, in the middle of your sentence there, I thought you were going to say he had to stop due to risk of hurting his voice.
[256:47.35]So he has to hear it.
[256:49.47]I really thought you were going to tell me his throat, but apparently no.
[256:53.33]Apparently he can still do it.
[256:55.24]But he's a legendary rock musician.
[256:58.80]But Axl Rose, it's weird.
[257:01.26]Anyways, thank you, Styx.
[257:04.17]Sergeant Mars, again, thank you for the $1.
[257:07.07]This is fun.
[257:08.81]Well, I'm glad you think so.
[257:10.03]Thanks for sticking around.
[257:12.47]Gunther.
[257:13.37]Thank you, Gunther.
[257:14.55]Welcome back, Gunther.
[257:16.70]Please say you're a pretty cool guy, Tabor.
[257:20.22]Is that better?
[257:20.72]Yes.
[257:21.86]Because in your previous message, you wanted me to say the F word to this person, and I don't know who that is.
[257:26.44]And I said it before, and now I'm on record of saying the F word to somebody that I don't know.
[257:30.59]And I don't want to do that.
[257:34.24]But thanks, man.
[257:35.68]Thank you, Gunther.
[257:37.40]Also, also, also, also, Sergeant Mars, again, gave another $2 here and says, good idea.
[257:43.79]I think you were referring to something a while ago, but thank you.
[257:47.45]Also, Glazed Donut, thanks for the $1.
[257:49.29]Imagine if I just walked up to you in real life and stuffed a dollar into your pocket and walked away.
[257:54.66]Now you'll never forget this analogy whenever you get bits.
[257:57.86]You know, actually, I thought about this, like, I said the other day, but I meant, I mean, like a year ago.
[258:04.04]If somebody were to walk up to me and hand me a $5 bill and be like, Here you go, Jerma!
[258:09.14]I'd be like, What are you doing?
[258:12.48]Take this back.
[258:14.35]Just you take it.
[258:15.23]It's yours.
[258:17.15]What would I do?
[258:17.75]What would I do in that scenario?
[258:20.07]I would probably not take it.
[258:21.97]Isn't that weird?
[258:23.91]That's weird how that works.
[258:27.29]Can you tell Sarah congrats on her job?
[258:28.96]Hey, Sarah, congratulations on your job.
[258:31.87]I hope you knock it out of the park.
[258:33.80]I hope you get like eight promotions, and I hope you run in the place.
[258:37.04]Real soon.
[258:41.58]What about a hundred?
[258:43.50]It would be like a hundred dollars.
[258:45.12]It would be weird.
[258:46.58]It would be weird.
[258:47.42]It would be odd.
[258:52.00]Hey, Sarah Gratz.
[258:54.74]Also, thank you to Spartan Cupcake for the one dollar.
[258:57.44]Do you remember I met a dwarf at TwitchCon, and that made him feel better.
[259:01.98]No, see, look, we can perpetuate this notion that I'm a tiny person.
[259:08.18]But all you guys that are saying that, when you see me in real life, actually standing up next to you, you're going to be like, oh, he's just a bunch of jokesters.
[259:18.06]He's like a normal size.
[259:20.58]He's, it's normal.
[259:23.81]Might not be huge, but it's just, we're all just normal humans.
[259:31.43]None of you guys have even seen me in real life.
[259:35.47]You can't base it off of photos.
[259:37.39]Haven't you seen these random Instagram models?
[259:41.04]They can turn themselves into anybody.
[259:42.72]Don't you know that?
[259:44.42]You look at one of these random fucking Instagram models, that could be a different person.
[259:47.66]And you see them in real life and it's like a shapeshifter.
[259:50.30]They could be anybody.
[259:52.88]Like all the costumes and shit.
[259:54.28]I could be wearing a costume every time you see me stream.
[259:59.93]And you would never know.
[260:03.30]Normal equals below average.
[260:07.26]What do you mean question marks?
[260:08.56]What are you talking about?
[260:10.62]You can't judge a couple of pictures on the internet of what somebody actually looks like in real life.
[260:16.19]I could like go, like I said, I could put on a wig and like stand on stilts and like you guys, you'd see it and be like, oh shit, what the hell?
[260:24.95]And I'd get it like photoshopped and everything and that's what I'm going to do.
[260:28.19]It's gonna happen.
[260:30.75]But anyways, thank you.
[260:31.89]We lost track there, but thanks.
[260:34.53]Real shit, how tall are you?
[260:35.93]I'm 5'7 and a half, 5'8 on a rainy day.
[260:41.09]If I have special shoes on, if I have like dress shoes on, I'm like 5'8 and a quarter.
[260:47.95]It's when I got those special shoes to make me bigger.
[260:53.73]Anyways, thank you, Squall.
[260:57.74]Where is Jan?
[260:58.48]That's a good question.
[261:01.00]Monty the Moose, thanks for the $5.
[261:02.30]Hi, you smell.
[261:02.90]I think I already got this one before.
[261:05.04]I'll make sure I didn't miss any down here from a few hours ago.
[261:08.08]I don't think I did.
[261:10.48]Thank you, everybody, for these bits and for your subs.
[261:16.76]You guys all rock.
[261:18.10]Much love.
[261:19.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[261:23.18]He's practically seven feet tall.
[261:24.52]Exactly.
[261:25.48]Come on.
[261:27.24]Have a good night.
[261:28.58]We will continue the Halloween horror week tomorrow.
[261:33.56]Good night, everybody.
[261:36.74]Ah, Edgemont with $10 right at the buzzer.
[261:39.42]Thank you, Edgemont.
[261:42.17]Hey, my computer's been crashing throughout most of the stream, but I wanted to ask, will I ever be selling more t-shirts?
[261:48.76]yeah yeah I just I gotta do it and I wanted to be good and there was like there was a couple of ideas a while back that I really want to do but I have to actually get in touch with the people that are involved and I've just been kind of not doing that for some reason
[262:08.27]It's just, I want it to be good, I want it to be worth buying, I want it to be something that you, like, care about.
[262:15.73]I've talked about this before with the Gloom Man shirts, like, I want them to be good.
[262:20.06]I don't want it to just be like, Jerma!
[262:22.60]Power to the players!
[262:24.22]Like, Jerma!
[262:25.16]Jerma!
[262:26.76]Taking them on!
[262:27.70]And it's like, my face, like, yeah!
