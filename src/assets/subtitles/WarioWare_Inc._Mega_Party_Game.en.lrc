[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.90]Good afternoon.
[00:01.42]Hi.
[00:04.60]Welcome back.
[00:06.00]Saw you yesterday, but welcome... Hey.
[00:07.32]It's good to see you again.
[00:12.17]Oh, monkaS clown detected.
[00:17.87]Today, we are going to play WarioWare for the Nintendo GameCube.
[00:24.44]And you're probably wondering, Jeremy, you said that we were probably going to be playing Casino Inc.
[00:29.40]today.
[00:31.08]And I wouldn't even be saying that.
[00:32.63]That was last night Jeremy saying that.
[00:34.48]It's a different person.
[00:37.28]The reason is because I think that game's going to take more than a few streams, or maybe more than one to two full streams to do.
[00:46.05]And I'm not going to be around tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day.
[00:50.65]Over the next four plus days, I've got a lot of stuff going on in my personal life.
[00:55.76]For those of you that don't know, I am moving.
[01:00.48]Staying in Vegas, but moving over the next week or two.
[01:04.82]And gotta get a lot of shit done.
[01:07.04]Gotta get a lot of stuff to get in order.
[01:12.06]Especially considering the circumstances as of right now.
[01:15.78]All the stuff with the coronavirus.
[01:18.92]I gotta get my shit together.
[01:23.63]He's moving to Vegas.
[01:25.47]That's right, I am.
[01:30.87]But, uh, so I didn't want to start Casino Inc.
[01:34.11]because I want to give it at least the necessary time because it looks like a really, really fun, interesting game.
[01:38.14]So I was like, what can we do today for a little while, uh, over the next X amount of hours?
[01:45.56]And, well, WarioWare is one of them.
[01:47.55]And, obviously, Animal Crossing as well.
[01:49.89]So the plan is we're going to play WarioWare until we have eaten our full.
[01:53.03]And then we're going to move on to Animal Crossing because I want to play it again.
[01:58.70]We're on first party Nintendo mode today, and yesterday.
[02:08.99]Las Vegas, here we come.
[02:11.65]That's the plan.
[02:12.25]He's gonna be demonetized.
[02:21.16]Where are you moving to?
[02:22.22]Las Vegas.
[02:22.78]Las Vegas.
[02:26.18]Staying in Las Vegas.
[02:28.04]Just a different place.
[02:33.20]Yeah, but where?
[02:34.14]Oh, well... You guys are fucked.
[02:49.65]Anyways, let's, uh, let's play.
[02:51.63]Let's play WarioWare.
[02:53.57]What's the... How many WarioWares are there?
[02:56.81]How many games... This is the GameCube WarioWare, right?
[02:59.44]Because they, like, renamed it.
[03:00.52]This is WarioWare Mega Party Games.
[03:04.92]But the original game was called Mega Micro Games.
[03:08.59]It was renamed or something?
[03:10.79]For some reason?
[03:13.19]I don't know, it's weird.
[03:14.81]But, uh, here you go.
[03:15.91]We have to do a test here.
[03:17.98]Because, uh, I don't know.
[03:22.14]It looks like there is a full four or five second delay when this is coming through my capture device.
[03:28.04]So we're gonna do a test.
[03:29.01]I would like for you all to participate in this test.
[03:31.85]Are you ready?
[03:32.31]Because it might- I gotta get this right before I play.
[03:37.07]One.
[03:39.95]How off is that?
[03:41.49]I need to know.
[03:42.13]It's probably very off.
[03:45.87]One, two, one, two.
[03:49.43]It's off by like a, yeah, it's going to be off by like two full seconds.
[03:52.33]When I move, let's say I hit left and I say, ah, I look over on my other screen.
[03:57.37]It takes three or four full seconds to happen.
[03:59.23]Alright, here we go.
[04:01.29]Let's try this.
[04:01.75]Ready?
[04:03.54]Tell me how this sounds.
[04:10.85]Do I actually have to delay my voice by 2,000 milliseconds for this to work?
[04:15.62]Holy shit.
[04:18.06]Hey.
[04:19.22]Hey.
[04:20.28]Hey.
[04:21.34]Hey.
[04:22.44]Hey.
[04:22.98]Hey.
[04:23.50]Hey.
[04:24.42]Better?
[04:27.20]Now that's too much.
[04:30.12]It's close.
[04:33.33]So, I'm early.
[04:36.63]So, you hear my voice first, right?
[04:38.73]Boop!
[04:42.75]Alright, here we go.
[04:43.85]Time to go to 20... God, I feel like I'm in the fucking, like, past.
[04:53.19]I'm in, like, the future.
[04:56.11]One.
[04:56.99]Two.
[04:58.09]One.
[04:58.99]Two.
[05:00.09]One.
[05:03.23]Hey.
[05:05.03]The video is early.
[05:06.13]How's this sound?
[05:12.11]Hey, what do you know about that?
[05:14.25]What do you know?
[05:15.15]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[05:22.75]I don't know.
[05:25.80]Nothing changed.
[05:26.44]It's worse.
[05:27.86]Fuck!
[05:28.76]This whole thing is fucked up.
[05:30.14]I need to, like, hear this, but I can't.
[05:31.70]Alright, hold on.
[05:33.48]Otto's trying to get in my room.
[06:00.85]He was like, let me in!
[06:03.21]Okay.
[06:06.57]Why is this such a huge delay?
[06:08.45]Okay, here we go, ready?
[06:12.69]One.
[06:14.95]Two hours of fixing delay.
[06:16.67]Why would it take like five full fucking seconds?
[06:24.31]It's close.
[06:26.09]One.
[06:27.33]Two.
[06:28.89]One.
[06:30.60]two alright what are you hearing video first or audio first or me first voice is slightly early okay hold on I'll get it this is this is this is it this is the one you ready

[07:07.92]Now the game's further behind.
[07:09.14]This doesn't make any sense.
[07:11.82]No, that's way too much.
[07:16.38]I just added so much more time.
[07:18.34]And...
[07:21.94]Good?
[07:24.44]Yes!
[07:25.04]Oh god

[09:32.96]The screen is cut off?
[09:34.66]Wait, why is the screen cut off?
[09:38.84]This is fucked up.

[10:15.41]Is there a boss?
[10:20.25]Oh fuck, I gotta put clothes on.
[10:21.27]I'm good.
[10:22.43]That's what I look like right now.
[10:26.43]Awww.

[10:48.36]Is he playing Party Game?
[10:49.96]No, they renamed this game.
[10:51.30]This is the original one for the GameCube.
[10:57.24]Alright, I got the one up.
[10:59.06]Let's go.
[10:59.54]Is this a facecam game?
[11:02.24]Do I really have to go put on clothes?
[11:05.68]What?
[11:14.41]Fuck, I'm gonna lose.
[11:24.14]Should have clothes on.
[11:25.32]No, I don't have to put on clothes.
[11:26.66]I don't have to wear clothes if I don't want to.
[11:28.38]Easy.
[11:28.78]Done.
[11:30.68]I'm in my own room.
[11:31.72]I'm in my own house.
[11:37.12]I'm not in your house, I'm in my house!
[11:43.44]Oh fuck, I lost.
[11:46.56]Do I actually have to?
[11:47.14]Alright, how about this?
[11:53.36]This is not my beautiful house.
[12:00.89]Holy fuck, there's a lot!
[12:03.45]Wait, wait.
[12:04.41]Intro.
[12:09.91]So wait, it's supposed to be zoomed in.
[12:11.71]Oh, alright, I get it.
[12:13.99]So, yeah, the game's not cut off.
[12:15.67]It's supposed to look like this.
[12:20.30]You guys freaking- I had it like that- I had the- everything was correct!
[12:24.76]Now I have to redo that!
[12:37.70]I think I'll get un-naked.
[12:38.78]Alright, I promise I'll put a facecam on in like, 40 minutes.
[12:49.09]I can't- this is just an intro, this is a story.
[12:51.33]Alright, speed up.
[12:56.81]Fuck, okay.
[13:05.15]Excellent!
[13:07.25]I love his voice.
[13:11.84]He's gonna turn into a clickbait facecam streamer.
[13:17.30]What the fuck?
[13:23.81]Jump!
[13:26.25]Jeremy, you should get a mustache.
[13:27.55]You want me to get a fucking mustache?
[13:31.89]No.
[13:32.71]You think you get, like, serial killer vibes from me now.
[13:36.29]If I grow a mustache, I increase that by, like, 50%.
[13:39.14]You know how many times I have to look at fucking Reddit threads and I get to see, like, oh, is this guy, like, a serial killer?
[13:53.68]Now imagine me with a huge-ass mustache.
[13:56.31]Instead of, is this guy a serial killer?
[13:58.87]It turns into, this guy's a serial killer!
[14:04.91]Balance.
[14:06.45]Oh shit.
[14:07.01]Okay, I got it.
[14:07.53]Got the pizzas.
[14:11.74]Curl.
[14:13.08]What?
[14:13.40]Oh shit!
[14:15.28]Dammit.
[14:15.54]I didn't understand what it meant.
[14:18.80]Spike the ball.
[14:25.37]Jump.
[14:27.51]Oh, I love this character.
[14:28.49]Look at that guy.
[14:29.93]Let's win.
[14:34.76]What?
[14:35.94]Did I get it?
[14:39.46]Shoot.
[14:40.20]Yes!
[14:40.62]Got it.
[14:52.44]The audio is bad.
[14:53.40]I'll try, I'll fix it in a minute.
[14:55.18]It's just... For some reason, this game in particular is like so fucked up when it got captured.
[15:02.39]And I was trying to figure it out, but I couldn't figure it out.
[15:04.15]Jump!
[15:04.43]Oh fuck, I gotta Jump King.
[15:05.41]Did I get it?
[15:12.93]Oh fuck, I have to press up.
[15:18.29]Shit.
[15:18.87]Alright.
[15:26.89]Shoot.
[15:27.78]Shoot what?
[15:29.52]Oh my god.
[15:30.22]I got it.
[15:34.26]No!
[15:35.14]I thought I was moving me.
[15:36.72]I thought I was moving the guy, not the trampoline.
[15:38.80]Shit.
[15:39.32]Alright, I'll put on clothes.
[15:40.12]I'll be back.
[17:47.74]You know what's funny?
[17:49.30]Me turning on my facecam just made syncing this whole thing up exponentially more difficult.
[17:54.49]Because now I have to sync the webcam too.
[17:56.33]There's like three different things that need to be delayed.
[18:03.03]This is gonna be, well, this is gonna be, well, we're here for a while.
[18:07.84]Alright, if I turn the webcam on, you're not gonna see, like, a naked body, right?
[18:10.12]Because sometimes this fucking camera takes the frame, the last frame that it saw, and it might be my naked body.
[18:16.99]So I need to make sure that's not gonna happen.
[18:22.75]Okay, I think we're good.
[18:23.37]Let me make sure this is right.
[18:33.53]Nope.
[18:34.79]See what I mean?
[18:35.17]You see what I'm saying?
[18:37.39]See that like that that could have been a naked person You guys ready for a cute look I get it look It's so weird to this is so delayed this is such a joke I can't even monitor what I'm doing I'm pointing and talking at you, but the guy over here is doing the same thing like three seconds later It's fucking freaking me out.
[19:05.14]Okay, you ready?
[19:07.78]Here we go.
[19:09.22]Let's test it.
[19:09.80]I need my audio.
[19:15.70]Holy shit, look at how many different fucking minigame levels there are.
[19:18.45]This is going to be sick.
[19:19.19]Alright, where's my fucking audio device?
[19:24.01]Half screen facecam.
[19:25.37]Well, it has to be that so we can get this synced up.
[19:29.82]Oh, I got another thing to sync.
[19:31.18]Welcome to the sync stream.
[19:34.54]Okay, here we go.
[19:39.59]How bad was that?
[19:42.65]Why is this jacket zipped up all the way?
[19:44.85]Oh, I don't know.
[19:46.09]I wonder why is this jacket zipped up all the way?
[19:48.74]It doesn't have anything to do with the fact that there's nothing else underneath this.
[19:53.14]And I put it on out of desperation because there's nothing fucking, there's nothing under here.
[19:59.87]It's just nudity under this zip-up.
[20:08.29]I'm not gonna stand up.
[20:09.71]I'm not standing up.
[20:10.65]Alright, we have a very specific task to do.
[20:13.67]Are you ready?
[20:14.09]I have to go back.
[20:18.83]So.
[20:21.13]When the door opens, I'm gonna move myself a little bit here.
[20:25.47]Let's get this open.
[20:26.07]This is gonna be so fucked up.
[20:35.53]Oh, fuck.
[20:36.07]I messed it up.
[20:36.51]Hold on.
[20:43.01]Wait, this is gonna help!
[20:44.05]Holy shit, this is gonna help.
[20:44.97]I can see it over here.
[20:45.63]I can see it like five seconds- wait, wait, wait, hold on, ready?
[20:51.36]Okay, I get- it's gonna be longer.
[20:52.66]Longer.
[20:52.96]Ready, check.
[20:59.91]This actually is gonna help.

[23:01.94]I just realized I just was fucking like pointing... Holy shit, there's a lot of people here that just watched me do that.
[23:10.15]There's a lot of people that just watched that happen.
[23:12.03]Like, I would do that on my own.
[23:14.05]I tried, but it was... Why is your forehead shining?
[23:17.91]I don't know.
[23:18.39]Because I have an oily T-zone.
[23:25.89]Here, here's your gold star.
[23:37.16]It's your T-Zone!
[23:39.00]God.
[23:46.97]Here's to that.
[23:53.33]Just take a shower.
[23:54.21]It doesn't even- That's a plastic surgeon terminology.
[24:02.17]No, it's a skin care terminology.
[24:07.22]That's what that is called.
[24:11.48]Okay, and that's how you can tell.
[24:12.94]And those of you, you saw it in real time.
[24:14.94]You saw it in real time.
[24:15.83]You watched it in real time.
[24:17.41]You watched me look at another monitor.
[24:19.71]There was five community subs came in, and I looked over at the other monitor, and there we go, I fell down and I got fucking hurt.
[24:26.21]Saw it in real time.
[24:27.03]So those of you that just like, that ask the question all the time, how the fuck did he miss that?
[24:31.82]I just looked over here because something happened over here.
[24:33.96]I looked over here.
[24:34.74]I was looking over there.
[24:35.42]I was looking over here.
[24:37.79]See?
[24:38.93]I should do facecam every day.
[24:41.07]Jerma sucks.
[24:41.61]Thanks to the Vive community subs.

[39:39.32]I can't say that I did something.
[39:41.34]Like, I can't say the word got it now because I've said it too many times and I've recorded it too many times.
[39:53.03]You're good at parking.
[39:56.76]Oh my god, I thought again.

[41:33.18]I have fucking no idea.
[41:34.54]You know what I know about Dr. Mario?
[41:36.38]It's his side B as he throws a pill in Smash Bros.
[41:38.64]I've never played the game.
[41:39.28]I don't even know what happens.
[41:47.03]It's Candy Crush, but it's different.
[41:50.41]Wait, that's not even right.
[41:51.71]That's incorrect.
[41:56.81]That's how much I know about Mario Doctor.
[42:00.99]Mario MD.

[43:42.33]Look, okay.
[43:45.99]This is, it's very easy to make yourself ugly.
[43:48.19]This is what I normally look like.
[43:50.57]Like this.
[43:52.25]Just a fucking normal person.
[43:55.45]If you, like, scrunch your face up and, like, press your lips into your jaw and, like, pull your nose back and, like, close your eyes and, like, scrunch your head, you can make yourself look ugly.
[44:05.89]Look at all these emotes of me doing, like, look, I'll show you.
[44:08.95]Ready?
[44:10.65]This is normal.

[45:26.94]You'd think anything's gonna embarrass me at this point.
[45:30.29]Think about that.
[45:31.77]I was in a fucking diaper on stream with slime in my, like, ass.
[45:36.57]And you think that me making, like, a face on camera is going to make me embarrassed that 6,500 people saw that?
[45:45.46]At this point, like, it's over.
[45:49.26]People wearing clothes.

[98:05.69]Oh shit.
[98:09.29]Stage clear.
[98:10.47]Character intros.
[98:11.39]Movie matters.
[98:13.20]Thrilling.
[98:14.10]Hard.
[98:14.74]All mixed up.
[98:16.66]Thrilling.
[98:17.12]Let's try thrilling.
[98:25.53]Why is it starting at 81?
[98:32.47]Oh man, he's gonna get us all!
[98:45.53]Oooooh, on a Ritz cracker.
[98:50.51]Oh my god, the link.
[98:53.17]Which is, which is, which is, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, sandwich this one.
[98:57.31]You gotta do more than one?
[98:58.01]What the fuck?
[98:58.91]Oh my god, okay, you gotta do more than one.
[99:00.71]What's, what's, buddy, what do you wanna click on?
[99:04.31]Yeah, I know, yes, sure.
[99:06.69]You took a photo, and you like did the, the smudge tool, and you smudged my eye over there by like 5%.
[99:11.66]Alright, that's fine.
[99:12.26]I wanna do this again.
[99:25.95]Ooh, that's a tiny little spot.
[99:36.74]Look at the clip, it's real.
[99:37.90]It's not fucking real.
[99:38.92]You took the smudge tool and you smudged my left eye by like 40% the other direction.
[99:46.28]It's not real.
[99:53.42]It's not real!
[99:54.78]I know it's not real.
[100:06.64]Put on the clip.
[100:07.34]I will in a minute.
[100:23.86]Look at the clip, look at the clip.
[100:27.08]Holy shit, that's fucked up.
[100:29.22]That's fucked up.
[100:33.60]It's not real.
[100:36.45]This only works one time, okay?
[100:39.35]This only works once before I catch on to the bullshit.
[100:43.35]It's not real.
[100:44.81]Watch the clip.
[100:45.51]Alright, I'll watch the clip.
[100:46.75]Give me the clip.
[100:47.27]Where is it?
[100:48.67]You got this clip to prove that this is real.
[100:52.33]Where is the clip then?
[100:54.79]I don't see you clip it in my office.
[100:56.39]I don't want to click on that one.
[101:03.62]That one's got like a fucked up title.
[101:09.48]What's with the title on that one?
[101:11.21]Why is that one so fucking weird?
[101:16.27]I don't want to click that one.
[101:18.67]That one's fucking freaking me out.
[101:20.89]You're freaking me out.
[101:29.06]How to make yourself look ugly.
[101:31.26]That's not- There is no clip.
[101:33.64]You guys are a bunch of liars.
[102:09.68]I can't do those!
[102:24.03]Am I using the filter to make your eyes look more blue?
[102:26.37]What?
[102:30.77]I'm not like a fucking psycho!
[102:35.15]I'm going to put a filter on today and make my eyes look wicked fucking blue.
[102:38.53]What are you talking about?
[102:39.96]I got bullied into putting the cam on in the first place.
[102:47.14]Perfect.
[103:02.02]This is not a... Guys, this is not a purple Twitch hoodie.
[103:04.22]This is a blue Twitch hoodie.
[103:05.71]They made different colors.
[103:08.09]Excuse me.
[103:09.39]This is blue.
[103:09.85]It's not purple.
[103:11.19]It's a deep blue.
[103:19.84]What game is it, though?
[103:20.42]What game is it, though?
[103:20.92]I hope it's fucking... I don't know.
[103:27.94]Six.
[103:28.38]Count them.
[103:33.05]Jacket's gonna be unzipped.
[103:35.01]Hey, you know what's getting rid of it?
[103:39.38]Oh, they're gonna... Ooh, that was close.
[103:51.44]Shoot!
[103:58.87]It's such a tiny little area.
[104:02.04]The pig is cute, yes.
[104:03.60]What are those noises from?
[104:14.38]What are those noises from?
[104:17.84]That, like... What is that from?
[104:21.49]No, no, it's from, like... It's from... What game is it from?
[104:30.84]No, no it's not, no it's not, no it's not.
[104:31.92]Give me the right one.
[104:33.28]This is not from this one.
[104:34.98]Those noises, I can smell those noises.
[104:38.90]I've heard them a million times before in like an NES game.
[104:45.83]Bubble Bobble?
[104:48.27]Yeah, maybe.
[104:51.69]Not Yoshi, no, no, no, no, no.
[104:53.41]Bubble Bobble?
[104:54.43]Yeah, definitely.
[105:07.64]Pugs Bunny in Crazy Castle.
[105:14.99]Check that shit out.
[105:17.33]Type E. Ooh.
[105:33.94]Y-E?
[105:34.04]I don't know.
[105:48.31]I don't know.
[105:48.69]I don't know.
[105:49.65]I don't know what it wants me to do.
[105:51.55]Oh, it's the ones that are spinning.
[105:53.93]And so when you do this, what you're trying to do is you're trying to spread it up.
[105:58.70]Blue shadow will make it so it'll accentuate your eyes.
[106:01.20]And then what you're going to do is you're going to take the blush brush right here.
[106:04.90]And you're going to add it to this part.
[106:06.30]And you're going to give yourself a nice little shine here.
[106:07.92]God fucking damn.
[106:16.33]I want to beat this.
[106:17.03]Oh my fucking god, end.
[106:22.99]Is this a celebrity meltdown?
[106:34.96]I'm not a celebrity.
[106:37.62]Where do you get this idea of a celebrity?
[106:46.14]Celebrity?
[106:51.67]He's an E-celeb.
[106:56.23]Just press every button, it doesn't matter.
[107:02.49]You're a top 10 Twitch streamer.
[107:04.09]Is that even accurate?
[107:10.33]You have 7,000 people watch you several times a week.
[107:18.04]Well, I'm glad you think I'm a celebrity.
[107:20.20]Which way do I go?
[107:23.10]There was no way to go.
[107:24.26]He's dead, no matter what.
[107:25.86]He's just fucking dead.
[107:26.86]I'm gonna try hard.
[107:32.26]Don't inflate his ego.
[107:33.66]I have to get at least 25.
[107:44.65]Otherwise, I refuse to stop playing until I get to 25.
[107:48.07]I have to.
[107:48.49]If you're a celebrity, why did you ignore me?
[107:55.71]Why didn't you ignore me at the grocery store?
[107:57.61]Wait, what are you talking about?
[108:01.28]Is this... This thing again?
[108:02.66]Oh, like you're doing now?
[108:04.72]Yeah, right.
[108:05.88]Whatever.
[108:06.62]Whatever the fuck you... Whatever.
[108:09.00]You know the thing.
[108:17.21]The coffee pasta, yes.
[108:24.78]Electrical interference, yeah.
[108:30.36]Excellent!
[108:30.90]25, here it is.
[108:49.05]Thank you!
[108:49.57]Whoa!
[108:57.70]Eating BLT right now, Tish is like... I like actually, I like actually, actually timed that person out for like 30 minutes.
[109:10.20]That was fucking outrageous.
[109:17.97]Like, give that person, like, at least 10 minutes to think about what they've said.
[109:23.67]Like, you've got to think about what you've said there.
[109:27.27]I'd like for you to press, like, tab up and see the last thing that you wrote.
[109:31.52]I'd like for you to sit there in your 10 minutes of silence and solitude here to say, yeah, I think this is worth other people reading this.
[109:45.78]I want you to really sit there and process each word.
[109:50.69]And then come back to us with your assessment after you're back from the ban.
[109:57.77]What did he say?
[109:58.37]Something fucking heinous.
[110:01.53]Just so disgusting and heinous that you have to be punished.
[110:04.85]Where did it go?
[110:16.29]What do you think about what you've done?
[110:20.56]Nobody knows what you're talking about?
[110:21.94]Only one person needs to know, and it's the person that said the naughty thing.
[110:32.68]They perva-banned him.
[110:38.41]What the fuck do you think is gonna happen?
[110:41.31]What do you think is gonna happen?
[110:43.83]Hold on, I'm bad at these.
[111:13.74]Slow mode, slow mode, slow mode.
[111:15.80]Help us slow mode, help us.
[111:18.58]Did I lose?
[111:19.20]Hey Bowser, get the heck out of here.
[111:38.84]Perfect pixel.
[111:41.12]Nobody said slow mode, I did.
[111:45.75]Double finger in the nose.
[111:47.33]That's hard.
[111:51.40]Watch it, you PG-13 ass.
[112:00.60]Yep.
[112:06.94]He's never going to get to 25.
[112:07.78]Yes, he is.
[112:08.58]Alright.
[112:11.18]No, get the fuck out of here.
[112:16.86]Where is this one?
[112:22.88]Tom, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:24.76]Oh, look at you.
[112:25.34]Oh, look at you.
[112:26.26]Oh, look at you guys.
[112:28.38]I'm eating.
[112:28.72]What are you eating?
[112:29.20]What's that thing you're eating?
[112:30.30]A bacon, lettuce, and fucking tomato sandwich?
[112:33.62]Hey, look at you.
[112:34.63]Let's see.
[112:35.15]Look at me.
[112:41.11]This game is intriguing.
[112:51.74]Can I just be very clear about something?
[112:53.82]The BLT is a dogshit sandwich.
[112:57.36]It's just a condiment fucking sandwich.
[113:00.08]It's just... Where's the thing that goes underneath all that?
[113:05.28]Lettuce, tomato, and bacon with bread.
[113:07.26]Where's the thing that goes underneath it?
[113:10.47]That's... What a scam of a sandwich.
[113:15.32]Like, imagine if you went to, like, a sub shop and you paid $8 for a large BLT and $8 for, like, a large chicken parm.
[113:21.86]You're getting way more fucking food to telecommunicate it down into your esophagus.
[113:27.91]BLT.
[113:30.83]And then people do what?
[113:32.51]BMT is what some people do?
[113:34.21]This game is groovy.
[113:36.79]Bacon, meat, and tomato?
[113:38.07]It's like, just call it a fucking regular sandwich.
[113:51.73]Oh my god, that's hard.
[113:56.22]If you put egg on there, that's, no, that's a substantial addition.
[113:58.76]Then, but why would you, no, but lettuce, tomato, and on an egg, lettuce on an egg sandwich.
[114:03.64]I wouldn't eat a lettuce egg sandwich.
[114:08.46]I wouldn't eat lettuce eggs.
[114:16.05]An egg, like a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with lettuce on it.
[114:28.35]I'm not gonna eat a bacon, tomato, and lettuce, cheese, and egg sandwich on like a croissant.
[114:44.31]Starbucks sandwich?
[114:48.15]OH!
[114:51.91]Starbucks sandwich.
[114:53.29]No, Starbucks sandwich is like an egg white tomato paste wrap with feta cheese, spinach, and avocado oil in it.
[115:11.97]What's wrong with feta?
[115:13.47]Nothing.
[115:18.23]Spinach feta wrap is 10 out of 10.
[115:21.79]I'm not, I don't understand the egg white thing.
[115:25.26]I want, I want, I want the fucking, I want the B vitamins.
[115:28.22]And I want the, I want the, the fun part.
[115:41.73]Did I really not get it?
[115:44.55]High cholesterol.
[115:45.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[115:46.72]Oh, high cholesterol.
[115:47.68]Yeah, you got a high cholesterol.
[115:49.44]There have been so many studies proving that the cholesterol in the egg yolks is really not even a big fucking deal.
[115:55.18]And all the vitamins and all the nutrients you get from the egg yolk are so much better than you deleting it from your life.
[116:04.58]You know how many studies there have been to prove what I'm saying correct?
[116:19.62]Am I ever going to get to 25?
[116:36.43]Oh, I was close.
[116:40.50]Return.
[116:43.10]Webcam is desynced?
[116:44.32]I'm sure it is.
[116:49.58]I'm trying.
[116:56.00]One guy said that?
[116:56.80]Thought we synced it up.
[116:58.46]Alright, well.
[117:04.60]Chat, stop.
[117:05.18]You are killing Jerma.
[117:10.28]Quick, stretch the webcam.
[117:12.86]No.
[117:20.09]I got eaten by the ground what the fuck alright I'm gonna do this three more times this one doesn't count this one doesn't count this one doesn't count that didn't come that one didn't come
[117:52.82]Have I done anything on Thrilling Mode?
[118:01.33]Um, I think this is Thrilling Mode.
[118:02.97]This is where we are now.
[118:10.22]Still on the pig level.
[118:11.38]Omega LOL.
[118:12.00]Let me get to 25.
[118:19.50]Praise.
[118:20.08]Great!
[118:29.67]This side.
[118:30.11]Yeah, okay.
[118:34.59]It's going the other way.
[118:37.25]It's like the Battle of Rain thing.
[118:38.42]If you're looking at it long enough, it goes the other way.
[118:40.36]Break.
[118:42.52]Holy shit, that was absolutely pogfic.
[118:54.65]Which one?
[118:55.33]All the way to the right!
[118:58.79]Settle down.
[119:00.83]Settle down.
[119:06.38]And go.
[119:27.74]Okay.
[119:30.20]Okay.
[119:55.05]Alright, let's go.
[120:59.55]Shit.
[121:04.97]No emotion for five minutes.
[121:08.67]Where is it, where is it?
[121:09.25]Square, square, square, square, square.
[121:12.11]It's got a resting gamer face?
[121:14.01]Figured if I, maybe if I just didn't move.
[121:19.35]What do you mean up?
[121:19.99]I just did it.
[121:20.53]I pressed up.
[121:21.09]It was up, up, down.
[121:23.19]I pressed up first.
[121:24.59]What the hell?
[121:25.83]I don't understand.
[121:26.55]I pressed up.
[121:29.37]I pressed up.
[121:38.91]I did press up.
[121:39.58]I pressed it.
[121:42.60]Go back in the VOD and look.
[121:43.98]I said I pressed it.
[121:44.76]That means I pressed it.
[121:45.34]I said it.
[121:45.62]If you look at the VOD, I said it right after I did it.
[121:52.22]He's still going.
[121:53.70]I'm trying.
[121:54.74]I'm interested.
[121:57.22]This is insane mode.
[121:58.40]This is thrilling mode.
[122:01.72]I gotta get to at least 25.
[122:04.42]I have to.
[122:05.14]Streaming for 2,000 more years.
[122:25.41]Ooh, that was tricky.
[122:31.69]I don't know.
[122:32.23]This side.
[122:33.39]Yeah.
[122:34.43]That went in an extra medium turtle.
[122:35.85]Alright, 10.
[122:52.37]I thought he was going to hurt me if I touched him.
[122:57.44]I thought he was going to hurt me if I touched him.
[122:59.18]I don't know.
[123:00.00]Okay.
[123:01.94]I'm choking, I know.
[123:02.62]But it's hard.
[123:04.44]Not a leaf.
[123:05.88]That's a butterfly.
[123:06.60]Eight.
[123:13.61]Eight.
[123:23.95]Goddamn, that's fucking hard.
[123:31.69]Come on.
[123:39.62]This one.
[123:40.20]That one's hard to determine.
[123:49.35]That one's hard to determine.
[124:02.66]I did it right?
[124:03.04]You just have to hold the wheelie?
[124:06.56]What did I get?
[124:11.30]The 19's the highest?
[124:11.92]Give me some easy ones in a row.
[124:13.68]He's back?
[124:13.97]What'd he say?
[124:14.39]What'd he say?
[124:38.29]They came back and just said poop.
[124:50.28]That's it?
[124:51.56]That's okay.
[124:53.18]Just don't fucking do that.
[124:54.12]Don't do that again.
[125:11.19]He mocked you.
[125:14.07]You don't, alright.
[125:16.27]You don't want to come into the king's court with a stick this big that's this small.
[125:22.22]It's like a twig that you broke off fucking like a tree.
[125:25.22]You came before into coming into my court.
[125:27.22]And you're gonna be like, hey, I've got something to say to you.
[125:30.20]And you're talking about the king that has like a plus 200 damage.
[125:34.05]Like lightning enchanted greatsword.
[125:36.11]That is as tall as the ceiling and it's as light as a small baseball bat.
[125:41.67]And I just literally have to go like this and I fucking cast lightning down.
[125:45.60]Like Legend of Zelda.
[125:47.36]On you.
[125:47.76]And I don't think you want to do that.
[125:51.00]I've got an incredibly powerful sword versus your less powerful twig.
[125:58.86]Wait, he's a king?
[126:00.22]Egomaniac.
[126:03.43]What?
[126:05.75]What?! !
[126:10.06]That's overcompensating.
[126:14.58]How so?
[126:15.43]I get- what?
[126:16.17]Because I have this huge fucking gigantic sword that's bigger than everybody else's.
[126:22.21]And I can- Okay, that might be- Alright, so the sword is- The sword is not as high as the ceiling.
[126:27.97]The sword is like this big.
[126:30.07]No, fuck the sword.
[126:31.05]It's a fucking magician's wand.
[126:32.75]It's a magician's wand.
[126:33.55]It's this big.
[126:34.33]It's small and it can fit in my hand.
[126:35.59]It's like a Harry Potter's wand.
[126:36.79]You know what I mean?
[126:37.47]And I can just be like, I can fucking disintegrate you.
[126:41.08]I just disintegrate you.
[126:42.14]You don't want to come to the king's court with a fucking Harry Potter wand that can disintegrate you in less than 10 seconds.
[126:45.62]I don't think you want to do that.
[126:46.66]You got a fucking tree off a branch outside.
[126:48.28]Moving on.
[126:54.13]Moving on.
[126:56.83]You don't wanna- don't- you don't wanna come fight the king with a twig when the king's got a fucking greatsword.
[127:02.01]Big bits.
[127:09.44]I- oh, I have to- I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I- Did we just play D&D?
[127:14.42]Yeah, and I've had my D&D character for 30 fucking years.
[127:18.24]You just filled out the character sheet an hour ago.
[127:23.41]You wanna throw the dice over at me?
[127:29.43]Good luck.
[127:33.45]Core Monster, thanks for the $50.
[127:34.61]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[127:38.28]And they have a very important message.
[127:39.72]The important message is... Pee-pee poo-poo.
[127:49.72]Very important for us to know.
[127:51.99]Thanks for the $50.
[127:52.65]That's an insane amount of money.
[128:00.90]That's a lot of money.
[128:01.54]Thank you, Core Monster, for the pee-pee poo-poo.
[128:05.40]I have no idea.
[128:06.64]Gotcha.
[128:07.18]Idiot.
[128:29.63]I don't even know what the fuck that's supposed to mean.
[128:34.70]I think I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm not going to be able to beat WarioWare Smooth Moves GameCube Edition.
[128:45.10]He's so rude.
[128:45.90]Oh yeah?
[128:55.33]I'm dealing with some... Okay.
[128:57.85]Alright, so I'm the rude guy now.
[129:01.23]I'm the rude guy.
[129:02.43]This whole conversation stemmed from somebody talking about of them... They were going to eat a BLT sandwich.
[129:08.89]And it was something about... I'm going to paraphrase here.
[129:12.21]Something about how they were going to eat... It tasted... I'm not even going to... Why would I even say it out loud again?
[129:25.59]But I'm the weird guy.
[129:28.29]I'm dealing with some- I'm not saying it.
[129:33.45]It's absolutely fucking heinous.
[129:35.27]Why would I ever say it?
[129:46.20]We're all psychos.
[129:48.78]He hates BLTs.
[129:49.84]Yeah, we already went over it.
[129:51.36]BLTs are stupid.
[129:56.22]Just remove the bread, and you have a Cobb salad!
[130:00.32]What's the point of the bread?
[130:01.06]The bread just makes no sense.
[130:02.72]Just, okay, if you're gonna eat a BLT, just remove the bread, and add, like, some Caesar dressing.
[130:10.08]And maybe a little bit of romaine.
[130:11.64]Done.
[130:11.82]You're eating a salad with bread.
[130:17.26]BLTs don't have corn?
[130:19.21]It's poppin' off.
[130:24.17]It's poppin' off.
[130:35.68]This is so based.
[130:39.90]Like, cool, whatever.
[130:40.92]How are we in there?
[130:49.18]Alright, that shit's hard.
[130:57.44]Bacon, lettuce, corn, and tomato.
[130:58.90]Why would there be corn in a BLT?
[131:03.38]Who's putting corn on their BLT?
[131:08.60]How many times do I have to fucking hit him?
[131:15.48]A corn BLT.
[131:21.77]Corn, bacon, and tomato.
[131:42.59]Alright, we already talked about this before, but I really did think that CBT was a time zone.
[131:51.03]I thought it was like central British time or something.
[131:53.39]We already went over it.
[132:10.85]That's the one!
[132:14.71]Alright, I'm done with this game.
[132:21.76]I'll lag one more round, and that's it.
[132:23.66]I'm admitting defeat.
[132:24.46]I'm going to admit defeat here in about a moment or two.
[132:38.27]Okay, it's orange, and it's got buttons, and it's orange.
[132:40.63]It's got the buttons.
[132:41.93]And it could be, I don't know, very... God gamer gives up on easiest game.
[132:48.01]I think this is the easiest game.
[132:51.51]I don't agree with you.
[133:04.56]Good.
[133:05.48]Alright, we haven't been this far in a while.
[133:11.64]Alright, alright, alright.
[133:17.30]Last one.
[133:48.49]He's getting mad?
[133:49.35]No, I'm not.
[133:50.43]I'm really not.
[133:52.01]I'm really not.
[133:57.98]I'm not.
[133:58.90]I'm not.
[134:01.86]No, I'm not.
[134:02.88]No, I'm not.
[134:03.50]Stop saying that.
[134:04.90]They're saying it.
[134:05.40]They keep saying it.
[134:07.02]They keep saying it.
[134:08.74]Stop saying it.
[134:10.96]I'm not.
[134:18.31]Absolutely seething.
[134:24.89]He's boiling.
[134:32.05]I still don't fucking get it.
[134:36.46]I'm doing this one more time and that's it, and then we're gonna move on to another game.
[134:39.68]This is the final, the actual true final, the final time I'm gonna do this, the final one.
[134:44.78]Here it comes.
[134:48.74]The true final moment.
[134:50.82]Final.
[134:51.20]I'll be silent for a little bit.
[134:55.78]I'm going to focus only on the video game and not on you guys.
[134:58.41]Why is it going to be over here?
[135:17.25]Got it, got it, got it, got it!
[135:45.07]Okay.
[136:16.24]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[136:21.64]I don't fucking even know what he looks like.
[136:23.52]He's a funny guy with a mustache.
[136:26.24]There's like seven of them in this universe.
[136:28.57]I don't know exactly what he... Holy shit, that's fucking hard!
[136:45.99]You got one square.
[136:59.16]Adam Sandler.
[137:01.82]I thought I was the hand.
[137:03.32]I thought I was the hand.
[137:05.26]Hey, Fred, I thought I was the hand.
[137:07.68]Bonnie, you weren't the hand.
[137:09.52]What are you, stupid?
[137:10.51]Sorry, Fred.
[137:11.41]I just thought I was the hand.
[137:12.47]Bonnie, if you don't shut the fuck up.
[137:14.51]Okay, let's go.
[137:27.23]I can't even put his clothes on right.
[137:32.24]Stop playing.
[137:32.82]No.
[137:33.24]No.
[137:34.71]No!
[137:35.37]I refuse.
[137:42.36]I can't even get past level 1.
[137:43.24]Okay, I'm done.
[137:43.64]I'm done with this one.
[137:44.44]I gotta... I gotta take it out of the system.
[137:47.38]What do I play?
[137:48.12]What am I gonna play instead of this?
[137:49.44]Animal Crossing's not happening for a little bit longer.
[137:51.39]I'm gonna take it out.
[137:51.91]I'm gonna take something else in.
[137:53.13]What else do I... I got, like, some other shit for, like, the GameCube.
[137:55.19]I can play.
[137:56.37]What else can I put in here?
[137:57.11]What am I gonna put in?
[137:57.87]What, um... I don't know.
[138:01.31]I'm gonna put something in here real quick.
[138:02.68]I got the GameCube set up.
[138:03.82]Hmm.
[138:17.89]Holy shit, that's... I got a shitload of Wii games and GameCube games over here.
[138:28.22]So, we're gonna do it one more time.
[138:53.77]When do I get to play?
[138:54.63]Oh my God!
[139:45.56]Why is it... Is that me?
[139:49.54]I don't know why I felt like a clip of me was just playing, going like, oh, oh, I... That freaked me the fuck out.
[140:04.31]No, no, no, alright.
[140:04.85]Alright, let me, I'm gonna go...
[140:23.21]I'm sorry, I got cut off because I'm delayed by like three full seconds.
[140:27.04]I said I'm going to go pee.
[140:28.33]I'm going to play another game.
[140:29.23]I'll be right back.
[140:29.91]It's probably going to be for the Wii or the GameCube.
