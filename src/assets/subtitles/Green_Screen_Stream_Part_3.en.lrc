[00:05.25]Alright.
[00:06.73]Okay, everybody settle down.
[00:09.89]Settle down.
[00:18.02]Hello.
[00:20.20]Yeah, and guess what, you can hear me, huh?
[00:22.72]You can hear me pretty well.
[00:24.50]Not like it was before.
[00:25.36]I'm not gonna drink a, hold on.
[00:38.36]Hey, how you doing?
[00:41.20]So not like it was before, right?
[00:42.94]You can actually hear me talking.
[00:44.17]I've got a little clip here.
[00:45.57]Hi.
[00:48.07]Previous times, I've been in front of the green screen.
[00:50.21]You couldn't hear a single goddamn thing I was saying.
[00:53.87]Not this time.
[00:54.69]Now you can hear me.
[00:56.21]And by the way, we're in full 60 FPS.
[01:02.01]Not 30.
[01:02.87]Not the 30 bullshit.
[01:04.11]This is 60 FPS.
[01:05.91]And I got a lav microphone.
[01:08.29]And I hope it works, because if it doesn't, then we're in big fucking trouble.
[01:13.69]Oh shit, I got a tweet.
[01:16.95]Does everybody hold on?
[01:17.68]Hang tight.
[01:20.04]So you can hear?
[01:24.64]I need to test this shit, because I have no idea how this sounds.
[01:29.62]I literally got these microphones like a day ago, not even 24 hours ago.
[01:35.75]If these things work, this company's getting a major shout out, like huge shout out.
[01:42.02]And by the way, high quality camera this time too.
[01:49.26]High quality camera.
[01:52.53]Does it sound good?
[01:53.37]Alright, hold on.
[01:56.55]Let me just tweet that.
[02:00.41]Yeah, so hopefully it sounds alright.
[02:02.89]These things are pretty cool.
[02:05.17]Let me try a scream test.
[02:06.05]Can I try it?
[02:06.93]Hold on.
[02:08.37]Can I scream?
[02:09.11]Can I scream in your ears?
[02:10.11]I'm going to scream in your ears.
[02:12.97]Seriously, I'm going to scream in your ears, and let me know how it is.
[02:16.52]Ready?
[02:18.08]Why would I not do this in front of the green screen?
[02:20.56]Alright, ready?
[02:22.92]This is an audio test.
[02:25.42]What's up?
[02:26.84]Audio test.
[02:28.22]Testing the audio.
[02:30.12]I'm going to scream, so turn down your volume.
[02:32.12]I'm being dead serious.
[02:35.26]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:37.88]That was probably horrible.
[02:39.16]I just got these microphones like fucking a day ago.
[02:43.95]Is it bad?
[02:46.73]Is it OK?
[02:48.03]I mean, we're peaking, but is it alright?
[02:53.37]You should smoke cigarettes.
[02:54.47]I'm not going to smoke a cigarette.
[02:58.93]Is it OK?
[03:01.18]Dude, my little brother's head just, whatever.
[03:09.26]Oh yeah, we need to tell Discord we're doing this.
[03:11.85]I've got my wonderful production assistant Holly here.
[03:14.65]You understand how much of a pain in the ass this was to do alone for the last fucking three or four years?
[03:21.15]You understand how hard this was to do alone?
[03:24.73]What a pain in the ass it was.
[03:27.49]I promise.
[03:28.45]It's going to peak.
[03:29.03]It's going to happen.
[03:29.63]But let's see.
[03:30.07]I got the gray shirt.
[03:30.69]I'm good to go.
[03:31.85]So what's the first thing I should do?
[03:34.76]She's going to be here to help me.
[03:35.94]This is going to be so much easier.
[03:37.08]You want to do the question?
[03:40.66]Alright.
[03:41.08]Let's get some classics.
[03:42.16]Let's get some classics out of the way first.
[03:45.82]Do I still got it?
[03:47.10]Do I still got it?
[03:51.54]Medium shot.
[03:56.92]That's not how I do it.
[03:57.82]What am I doing?
[03:58.36]Hold on.
[03:58.74]That's not how I do it.
[04:02.96]I've got to come into frame with it.
[04:05.03]I've got to see if I still got it.
[04:05.99]Alright.
[04:14.07]I think I still fucking got it.
[04:17.83]I'm sorry, mom.
[04:21.95]Alright, so what's the first thing?
[04:24.11]There are like 300 fucking things I have to do right now.
[04:28.49]I'm not doing this ever again.
[04:29.47]This is the last time.
[04:30.13]So we're going to blow through these like a million times a second.
[04:33.71]Alright, you want to ask a question?
[04:40.88]Yeah.
[04:41.00]How, why, when, who, how much, where, what?
[04:42.16]Are you ready?
[04:42.44]Wait, how?
[04:42.64]What?
[04:42.84]How, why, who?
[04:45.32]How, why, who?
[04:45.90]When, how much, where?
[04:48.52]How?
[04:48.82]How?
[04:49.94]How?
[04:51.34]Why?
[04:51.78]Who?
[04:54.69]How much?
[04:56.61]Where?
[04:58.05]Why?
[04:59.45]Huh?
[05:00.85]Who?
[05:02.39]Hey, how much?
[05:04.77]What was the other ones?
[05:06.42]What are the other ones?
[05:09.68]Are you ready?
[05:12.26]Why are you ready?
[05:13.48]Into the camera or just off?
[05:20.77]Hey, are you ready?
[05:24.09]Are you ready?
[05:24.77]You don't look ready.
[05:27.05]Hey, how?
[05:34.32]Are you ready?
[05:38.70]They didn't hear that.
[05:39.86]They didn't hear that.
[05:40.40]You didn't hear that.
[05:41.82]I have a lavalier microphone, but you didn't hear that.
[05:44.84]OK?
[05:46.63]What was I asking you?
[05:47.53]How do you do that again?
[05:49.65]Okay, are you ready?
[05:50.57]Because I mean, very clearly, we got to go.
[05:55.65]What did they hurt?
[05:56.35]Oh, answer their answers.
[06:02.41]Okay, give me I have both of my hands in my back pocket.
[06:12.22]Like, Oh, yeah, right.
[06:15.48]Yes.
[06:17.02]Yes.
[06:20.87]Yes.
[06:23.17]No.
[06:25.00]No.
[06:27.54]No.
[06:29.60]Absolutely not.
[06:30.92]No.
[06:31.20]I ain't gonna do it.
[06:31.86]No.
[06:32.54]No.
[06:32.84]Sorry.
[06:34.67]No.
[06:35.91]No.
[06:39.21]Why not?
[06:41.07]I feel like I've had like a weird audition.
[06:43.30]I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[06:45.40]There's like three people with clipboards over there and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.
[06:53.81]Why not?
[06:55.47]Huh?
[06:56.93]No.
[06:57.65]No.
[06:58.21]No, I'm sorry.
[06:58.67]No.
[06:58.75]I ain't gonna do it.
[07:00.63]No.
[07:02.37]No, fuck you.
[07:04.13]You see what I got dealing with back here?
[07:06.36]You think I'm gonna do that shit?
[07:08.14]No.
[07:08.86]You do it.
[07:10.34]You go do it.
[07:11.18]You deal with this.
[07:11.98]No, I'm not dealing with that.
[07:14.07]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[07:16.15]You are.
[07:17.51]You're the one with the money.
[07:18.15]Alright, what's next?
[07:27.04]Yes, alright, what is backroom Jerma?
[07:31.38]Yeah, what is it?
[07:33.64]Come around the corner, stop and stare at the camera like a madman for a few seconds before sprinting at the camera.
[07:40.61]Alright.
[07:42.47]Why is it, how is this back rooms?
[07:43.91]What does that even mean?
[07:48.40]Like this?
[07:50.50]They can hear all these burps and it's gonna be fucking embarrassing.
[07:52.54]They're gonna hear literally every single one of these burps.
[07:56.76]They're gonna hear every burp and it's gonna be, they're gonna clip every single burp I've done and it's gonna be embarrassing, alright.
[08:02.07]Don't listen to my burps, just fucking delete them.
[08:04.03]Don't listen to them, alright.
[08:05.83]So around the corner, stare, and then run at the screen.
[08:23.35]I lost a shoe.
[08:26.36]Hold on, take two, take two, take two.
[08:28.22]Oh!
[08:41.96]You okay?
[08:55.22]Okay, we're good.
[08:56.44]Is that the only thing that fell?
[08:57.94]I think it bumped the power.
[09:05.99]Nothing happened to me.
[09:06.69]Alright, are we still live?
[09:11.31]We're good.
[09:11.55]Yeah, I think we're good.
[09:14.81]Okay.
[09:18.10]Oh, that's an expensive mic.
[09:19.66]No, it's not.
[09:24.14]Wait, that's yours?
[09:25.38]Oh, shit.
[09:26.50]I'll replace it, I promise.
[09:30.65]Now, the worst part about that is you didn't get to see that, which actually kind of sucks.
[09:34.57]But I full sprinted back there, and there's a million chords here, and I tripped over one of the chords and took an expensive microphone down.
[09:40.19]I'm going to replace it.
[09:44.47]There's so many chords back there that I almost, like, died.
[09:48.00]Alright.
[09:50.24]We'll do it again?
[09:50.66]Here we go.
[10:12.38]There you go.
[10:13.12]Okay.
[10:15.33]Thank God it wasn't the Ethernet.
[10:16.49]Do you want to ride a roller coaster?
[10:19.67]Okay, ride a roller coaster.
[10:20.69]What are these?
[10:21.05]Okay, roller coaster.
[10:21.85]Should I be in a seat?
[10:22.49]You're pretending to be inside of it, raising your arms up.
[10:33.72]Does this work?
[10:35.98]I hope this works.
[10:38.20]I wish that was on camera.
[10:39.36]God damn it.
[10:40.68]That sucks that that wasn't on camera.
[10:45.15]So I'm going to roller coaster.
[10:47.77]Should we do this from two different angles?
[10:51.75]OK.
[10:57.44]I've been waiting to ride this one, man.
[11:01.00]Yeah.
[11:02.50]You know, I heard this is the scariest ride at the park.
[11:05.16]Yeah.
[11:06.45]I'm not scared, though.
[11:07.11]Are you scared?
[11:08.07]Yeah, I bet you are.
[11:08.91]I bet you're scared.
[11:13.23]I'm not scared at all.
[11:16.26]OK.
[11:17.14]OK.
[11:18.54]Yeah.
[11:21.60]Whoa.
[11:22.02]Hey.
[11:22.88]Hey.
[11:24.24]Hey, you can see the whole park from here.
[11:25.64]Can you see?
[11:27.32]That's crazy.
[11:29.32]Dude, look.
[11:29.68]You can see.
[11:30.18]You can see the water rides.
[11:32.12]I didn't even know the park had water rides.
[11:35.04]OK.
[11:37.34]Yeah, dude.
[11:39.44]Yep.
[11:39.96]OK.
[11:40.24]Yep.
[11:44.02]No, I ain't going to scream.
[11:45.88]You're gonna scream though.
[11:48.14]Okay, this is really hot now.
[12:10.16]Why does every wooden roller coaster do this shit?
[12:22.95]Why am I spinning around?
[12:24.79]Dude, I got it.
[12:25.25]I got it.
[12:25.47]I'm alright.
[12:25.75]I'm alright.
[12:27.63]This thing ain't safe, man.
[12:28.59]This thing's not even a safe ride.
[12:29.63]I don't think this has been rated.
[12:31.83]Has this shit even been rated?
[12:35.89]It's alright.
[12:36.29]I'm alright.
[12:36.69]I'm alright.
[12:37.19]I'm alright.
[12:39.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:41.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:42.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:45.93]Oh.
[12:52.41]Wee!
[12:54.89]Hold on, let me give you a better one, let me give you a better one.
[12:59.29]This is what I would do on a roller coaster.
[13:00.65]I wouldn't be saying wee, I'd be screaming.
[13:03.55]Alright, here we go.
[13:10.73]Wee!
[13:10.97]Stop turning.
[13:18.05]Hey, man.
[13:19.17]Hey.
[13:20.41]You know what I mean?
[13:22.48]This is a big drop coming up here.
[13:25.78]Wee.
[13:32.66]I don't like doing that.
[13:34.42]I feel like I'm going to fall out.
[13:38.42]Okay.
[13:39.08]Nobody use this for anything else besides what we're doing this for.
[13:41.76]There's no way anyone's going to use this for anything else besides riding a fucking roller coaster.
[13:45.10]Alright.
[13:45.99]That's enough.
[13:50.47]Evil villain monologue?
[13:51.93]I feel like I need to be in an evil villain costume.
[13:58.96]What do we have for costume?
[14:03.16]Do I want to drink poison?
[14:05.88]Oh, I was like, what?
[14:10.21]Here we go.
[14:10.49]There we go.
[14:11.17]Do you want to take a scroll through?
[14:18.56]Gary's Mod Ragdoll animation?
[14:20.45]OK.
[14:20.97]Is that better?
[14:21.31]You can hear me, right?
[14:24.85]What is a Gary's Mod Ragdoll?
[14:28.37]There's also Family Guy Ragdoll, right?
[14:30.43]Alright.
[14:35.28]Let me see if I can try that.
[14:37.46]There's so much shit back here.
[14:38.60]We're going to be here all night.
[14:40.60]Alright.
[14:42.72]The Family Guy thing is this, right?
[14:44.06]You go like this.
[14:55.10]Like that?
[15:13.79]Like that?
[15:18.92]I'll do it one more time, one more time.
[15:23.04]I gotta like just duct tape this around my neck.
[15:29.47]Alright, alright, you cartoon monster.
[15:36.89]Ow!
[15:47.85]Yeah.
[15:50.05]Yeah.
[15:52.09]Thumbs up?
[15:54.27]Okay.
[15:58.55]Oh God, get it off me?
[16:06.13]You guys feel any, there's bugs everywhere.
[16:11.95]Hey, come on out here, because there's bugs everywhere.
[16:13.37]I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.
[16:15.28]I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.
[16:18.16]Dude, is there something on me?
[16:20.72]Is there something on my back?
[16:22.26]Is there something on my back?

[16:28.65]What's on my back?
[16:29.21]Dude, get it, just get it.
[16:30.41]I'll stand still.
[16:30.95]I'll hit it with a baseball bat, I don't care.
[16:35.55]Oh my God, it's huge.
[16:36.57]Dude, it's huge.
[16:37.75]It's huge, please.
[16:39.41]Come on.

[17:08.79]That was my back rib, you fuckin' idiot!
[17:12.33]Ow!

[17:20.52]You need to take me to a hospital!
[17:22.80]Please!
[17:24.37]You hit way too hard.
[17:29.81]What?
[17:31.65]They can hear my heartbeat?
[17:33.84]Oh, it's because it flipped upside down.
[17:38.96]Maybe move it to your shoulder.
[17:46.24]Wow.
[17:46.93]Alright, hold on.
[17:47.79]Give me one second.
[17:49.87]That's fucking crazy.
[18:02.40]Somebody said, dude, we can hear your heart murmur.
[18:06.12]Can you still hear it?
[18:11.09]Are we good?
[18:16.99]Is that better?
[18:22.19]No more heart palpitations?
[18:28.49]I can't move.
[18:29.65]Alright, so what have we got?
[18:31.43]What's next?
[18:34.45]I'm on TV, alright?
[18:35.32]That's probably up here.
[18:35.92]Are they filming?
[18:46.16]Are you filming?
[18:51.57]I'm on TV.
[18:52.79]They're filming, right?
[18:54.15]Get out of here.
[19:04.14]Hi, Mom.
[19:05.63]Hey, Mom, I'm on TV.
[19:06.71]I'm sorry.
[19:07.21]I'm sorry.
[19:07.45]Can I have the mic?
[19:08.69]No, you don't have to give it to me.
[19:10.01]I'm on TV, Ma.
[19:11.29]Look at me.
[19:11.63]I'm on TV.
[19:13.15]Oh, I'm on the television.
[19:15.13]Channel 2.
[19:17.44]I'll leave.
[19:17.82]I'll leave.
[19:18.32]I'll leave.
[19:18.66]But that's so cool you guys are here.
[19:21.42]That's awesome that you guys are here.
[19:23.40]Do you guys come here a lot?
[19:26.16]Maybe like once every few months?
[19:27.70]That's cool.
[19:28.54]Can I talk on the mic?
[19:29.99]No?
[19:30.21]It's okay.
[19:30.79]Alright.
[19:31.09]I don't need to.
[19:32.39]Can I talk?
[19:34.18]OK, alright, alright.
[19:35.66]Bye, Mom.
[19:37.58]Pasta tonight.
[19:39.18]Pasta tonight, Mom.
[19:41.30]I hope so.
[19:43.10]I'll be OK with McDonald's, too.
[19:48.20]Alright, now what?
[19:51.38]Alright, so I'm going to skew a few cartoon splatting into the wall.
[19:56.10]Jonathan GRUBER- Cartoon splat?

[26:30.68]No, this was welded with dragon bone.
[26:35.79]I don't know if you can tell by looking at that.
[26:39.23]I remember I was there when this, I almost fell backwards.
[26:43.29]I remember I was there when this was crafted in dragon blood.
[26:47.47]They call it dragon stone steel.
[26:51.57]You think you can handle that?
[26:53.39]You think you can handle that?
[26:55.01]Let's find out.

[29:55.62]I'm going to have to take a health potion after that one.
[29:58.60]Redo.
[30:03.26]Going to need a health potion after that one.
[30:04.47]Good thing I stocked a few of them.

[31:41.92]You little jester over there, you're so funny.
[31:45.25]I made things happen.
[31:46.65]I raised taxes on everybody.
[31:48.79]Every single person now owes 40% more taxes.
[31:51.39]That means more money for the kingdom.
[31:54.27]Oh, yeah.
[31:56.07]How many people did we kill today?
[31:57.05]60?
[31:58.21]Yeah, that's a lot.

[42:15.68].
[42:19.83]No, it's OK.
[42:21.91]So pantomime each note.
[42:24.35]Like pantomime playing it, and also play each note once so people can edit it.
[42:57.58]I'm probably so red.
[42:58.82]I'm like hot.
[43:20.13]I'm like holding my breath to do that.
[43:22.75]Because I can't breathe.
[43:23.85]I can't breathe in this fucking thing.
[43:32.24]I have to hold my breath to do this.
[43:34.96]I'll just pantomime every note, hold your fucking breath.
[44:04.78]Do what you want with that, I don't care.
[44:12.52]Do a bong rip?
[44:19.42]Oh, okay, right, yeah.
[44:23.11]Should I do, I don't want to get out of this unless I want to do everything in it.
[44:28.47]Oh yeah, wizard stuff.
[44:33.45]Yeah, get this jingly fucking thing out of here.
[44:46.32]Give me these.
[44:48.12]Of course I'm going to do fucking Harry Potter shit again, right?
[44:52.80]Should I be more like the Malfoyles?
[44:55.60]I need a mustache, too.
[44:56.64]That's important.
[44:59.15]I have to do the Harry Potter shit again.
[45:02.56]I'm gonna look like such a moron.
[45:05.52]Hold on.
[45:17.39]Let me do this.
[45:19.03]Yeah, hold that for a sec.
[45:25.71]Balls exposed?
[45:26.77]What are you talking about?
[45:29.26]My balls are not exposed.
[45:34.78]Oh, I see.
[45:35.84]They mean those balls.
[45:36.96]I get it.
[45:37.30]Yeah.
[45:39.57]Wait, what is that?
[45:40.37]Beards.
[45:41.93]Danny, the Malfoyles have beards?
[45:44.23]Maybe this one.
[45:46.59]Who owns Malfoyle's family?
[45:49.53]Who's like that Malfoyle, the head of Malfoyle?
[45:54.08]Hold on.
[45:57.58]I kind of feel like I could do this in the camera.
[46:04.33]You know what I mean?
[46:04.75]Who owns Malfoyle's family?
[46:06.35]Is it like Dave Malfoyle?
[46:19.32]Hold on, how's it look?
[46:28.48]Like a judge.
[46:30.23]Should I just do judge shit instead?
[46:38.32]I look like a fucking judge.
[46:43.16]This is not a wand.
[46:44.56]Harry, don't they all talk like, Harry, you're not as smart as all of us, you're not as smart as the rest of us.
[46:53.39]They all look like this.
[46:56.45]Get him, seize him, take him away.
[46:59.51]My son is way more intelligent than you'll ever be, Harry.
[47:04.50]and you prance around and act like a little boy, while my little boy also prances around too, apparently.
[47:15.03]Oh wait, this is actually, okay.
[47:20.27]I don't even think I can put this on.
[47:21.15]I can tape it.
[47:25.57]Do we tape it?
[47:27.95]I need my wand too.
[47:38.68]I'm just gonna tie it like a regular knot, I don't care.
[47:44.73]I don't care, that's fine.
[47:48.77]Okay, how's that?
[48:00.72]If you aim to duel somebody, go for it for real.
[48:07.36]Okay.
[48:18.67]Harry Potter.
[48:22.16]Wonderful to see you here.
[48:24.18]Don't you have class, Harry?
[48:26.62]Class is in session right now.
[48:28.52]Potions.
[48:30.20]Heard you're quite the student.
[48:32.62]You and Ron and Hermione.
[48:35.00]Hermione.
[48:37.49]I'm keeping an eye on you, Potter.
[48:40.67]You mess up one more time and you talk to my boy
[48:46.56]Lucius Malfoy, again like that, it'll be the end of you.
[48:53.22]And if you're going to use your wand, I might as well suggest you use it.
[48:58.02]No bluffing this time, Harry.
[49:00.30]No bluffing.
[49:05.75]You're a little shit, and you always were.
[49:08.47]But you didn't know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.
[49:27.69]Oh.
[49:30.53]Oh, I killed him.
[49:31.43]I think I killed him.
[49:33.81]Oh, I just, Harry?
[49:34.99]Harry, are you okay?
[49:36.31]Harry?
[49:37.43]I need a doctor, hold on.
[49:41.35]Ividicus!
[49:43.74]Okay, he's alright.
[49:44.72]He's fine.
[49:45.32]He's fine.
[49:45.92]Everyone's laughing.
[49:46.82]If it's fine, it's okay.
[49:48.08]Harry's fine.
[50:02.87]Hello, students.
[50:03.83]Welcome to the Defense of the Dark Arts class.
[50:09.25]My name is Lúcio Malfoy.
[50:12.27]I'm the new teacher in town.
[50:14.71]And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.
[50:21.59]Dr. McGillicuddy.
[50:25.83]Let's go ahead and open this.
[50:27.03]It's a great peppermint schnapps, by the way.
[50:33.71]I'm sorry.
[50:34.97]I'm sorry.
[50:37.91]If you could all open up your textbooks and go to page 200, please.
[50:43.00]We're going to be using
[50:45.23]Yes, yes, Ron, please.
[50:48.93]Page 200, we're going to be making a frog breath potion.
[50:53.83]You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[50:56.69]The one you used when you killed Lucius?
[51:03.59]Open up your textbook.
[51:10.14]I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[51:11.78]That's not the time to use that spell.
[51:14.55]Didn't they ever tell you, you only use that spell if you mean to kill another wizard?
[51:20.67]Never use that spell, Harry.
[51:25.39]And now you're gonna be floating in the air.
[51:27.15]There he is.
[51:29.03]Turn him around, down.
[51:30.19]He's swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around, down.
[51:35.87]Never use that spell in my classroom again.
[51:40.88]Turn to page 300.
[51:41.38]We're not doing that spell anymore.
[51:47.53]Fucking gross.
[51:49.64]It tastes like fucking Pez.
[51:58.78]There it is.
[52:05.03]When I spend far too long on this, people take the shit that's not even funny and then they turn it into something funny, so I'm very hopeful.
[52:13.51]Okay, here we go.
[52:18.14]uh no no beard well class it's been a pleasure absolute pleasure but you all don't understand the power of the dark lord and for that reason I'm out just like that show shark tank
[52:50.93]Oops.
[52:54.56]Yeah, ooh, nice one, Harry.
[52:59.16]Almost got me.
[53:01.14]Holding onto my fucking balls.
[53:03.20]This looks fucked.
[53:08.26]I gotta go the other way.
[53:09.08]Does that work?
[53:17.60]Hey, Harry.
[53:20.11]See you tomorrow, potions class.
[53:24.85]How fucked is this?
[53:37.20]Is this fucked up?
[53:42.36]You look like a witcher.
[53:49.35]The Witcher, hold on.
[53:51.58]We gotta change it to The Witcher.
[53:55.54]Does The Witcher have an eye patch?
[53:58.18]Okay.
[54:04.29]This tie is so long.
[54:07.43]Can you see this?
[54:09.95]I look like a 10 year old wearing dad's suit to work.
[54:14.23]This is ridiculous.
[54:15.10]This shouldn't be like this.
[54:16.52]I feel like I'm two feet tall.
[54:22.81]What's a character's name in The Witcher?
[54:26.39]Anybody that's not The Witcher.
[54:27.27]It could be anybody.
[54:27.79]Let's do a test.
[54:35.00]Geralt is you, Zoltan.
[54:38.26]It is I, Geralt of, was it R?
[54:40.26]It says an R. Huh?
[54:41.40]Geralt of what?
[54:43.48]Let's see.
[54:43.68]I'll say your most important name you wrote.
[54:49.58]Rivia?
[54:49.80]Rivia.
[54:52.29]Geralt of Rivia?
[55:16.16]I'll take a drink.
[55:18.89]Oh, you don't know who I am?
[55:21.05]Geralt of Rivia.
[55:23.71]You should know.
[55:26.51]Two orange juices.
[55:28.35]I'm gonna drink one now and one later.
[55:32.27]Thank you.
[55:38.09]Thank you.
[55:43.00]Any witches?
[55:44.92]You seen any witches here?
[55:47.62]No?
[55:49.36]Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.
[55:52.27]Hey, you, come here.
[55:54.89]That's right, you.
[55:59.95]Heard you were a witch.
[56:03.35]I got a letter from the King of Rivia that said that you were a witch.
[56:09.04]Are you?
[56:10.46]I've never played this game.
[56:13.14]I've never played this game.
[56:14.52]I have never played any of the Witchers.
[56:17.30]Do you want to know what I know about The Witcher?
[56:18.58]Okay, here's what I know about The Witcher.
[56:22.42]I know about The Witcher is this, I know that the first game and the second game especially, hey, yeah, sit down, you're gonna wanna hear this.
[56:28.66]Sit down, witch.
[56:30.52]I heard that the second game had four to five minute loading screens when you went outside or inside of a building.
[56:37.58]So that's why I never played it.
[56:39.22]I never really cared for it.
[56:40.22]I actually tried to load into one building and I couldn't get in, it took about four minutes.
[56:44.28]So I uninstalled the game, the game that I'm in.
[56:47.08]You're right, The Witcher, me.
[56:49.02]You got something to say about that?
[56:50.06]We fixed the loading times in the enhanced edition.
[56:53.42]Yep, yep, that's the guy that played it.
[56:56.37]That's the guy that played the one before the enhanced edition.
[56:59.25]Yeah, I remember, it sucked.
[57:01.29]What you gotta say now?
[57:03.29]Which... Wait, hold on, let me do my patented move that I do.
[57:26.79]That's what I did in all those games.
[57:30.47]Rick Sanchez?
[57:35.95]Give me a gun.
[57:36.55]I can't.
[57:51.06]This wig, it smells.
[57:57.45]Goblin time?
[57:58.03]Alright, let's do goblin time.
[57:59.01]Do you want to do the lizard orb with the beard?
[58:02.85]Yeah, give me the beard.
[58:03.35]It kind of smells.
[58:06.15]The whole thing smells.
[58:08.41]It all smells.
[58:09.35]Why does everything that comes out of a costume bag smell?
[58:12.51]They smell like chemicals.
[58:25.80]Like this?
[58:30.06]Gandalf?
[58:41.29]Oh, wait, no, Gandalf.
[58:42.55]Alright, I want someone to put me in the PlayStation 2 Lord of the Rings game.
[58:56.22]Is it right-handed or left-handed?
[59:55.47]I just want someone to do that.
[59:57.93]Oh.
[60:04.69]You shall not pass!
[60:22.95]You are not going to go by me.
[60:32.68]You are not passing any time soon, Buster.
[60:38.18]I can do that better.
[60:44.42]You shall not pass.
[60:54.94]OK.
[60:56.20]What's next?
[60:57.49]Goblin time?
[60:58.23]OK.
[60:59.23]You want to do like the artist, like the chef stuff?
[61:02.29]Yeah, I'll do the chef stuff.
[61:07.01]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[61:38.90]Oh, yeah.
[61:49.55]Run.
[61:54.23]What the hell is this?
[61:56.41]Peer into the orb.
[61:58.23]Peer into the orb?
[61:59.61]Yes.
[62:02.03]Do we have an outlet?
[62:03.85]How am I going to do this?
[62:04.54]You don't have to have one.
[62:06.76]Oh, alright.
[62:13.30]I see many things in here.
[62:16.06]Frodo, I see you.
[62:19.54]I see Sam.
[62:21.90]And I see Hawaii.
[62:23.86]I want to go there soon.
[62:25.88]After all this, of course, after all this, you need to go to Mordor, which, if I had to guess, would be in this location here, covered by all the smoke and smog.
[62:44.12]Why don't you take it?
[62:45.08]I'm sweating.
[62:46.60]I'm sweating my ass off in this thing, Frodo.
[62:49.51]Take this from me.
[62:50.25]It's very hot.
[62:51.61]As you can see, it's burning.
[62:53.13]It burns my head and my face, and it's making me red and sweaty.
[62:56.39]Take it, Frodo.
[62:58.43]Take it from me.
[62:59.47]Please, take it now.
[63:02.07]Ow!
[63:03.15]Ow, it hurts, Frodo!
[63:04.30]Take it!
[63:04.72]The warmness of disasters, they're all mundane, like you'll spill your water.
[63:15.14]With this?
[63:21.38]Oh, no, no, no.
[63:23.76]I see something horrible.
[63:27.15]Come closer, come closer.
[63:30.27]Tomorrow afternoon, a dire thing will happen to you.
[63:37.03]It will spill your water on the table and it will drip, drip, drip over the edge down to the ground.
[63:44.86]and it'll keep dripping to a point where you have to wipe under the table because water got under the table side and you need to really wipe under there and then under these where the cabinets are.
[63:57.22]It drops into the cabinets kind of.
[63:59.26]You need to open the cabinet door and wipe the side of the cabinet and it sucks.
[64:06.04]Be careful.
[64:07.98]Also, next week you will buy a lottery ticket, yeah?
[64:14.96]Oh, yeah.
[64:16.64]And then that lottery ticket, you'll scratch off the first three numbers and you will be a winner.
[64:21.40]And you will scream victory.
[64:22.74]You'll be so happy about this.
[64:24.90]But unfortunately, it's a $2 winner.
[64:30.94]That sucks.
[64:32.02]That's really horrible.
[64:33.70]Not even a $5 winner.
[64:34.86]It was a $5 ticket, by the way.
[64:38.00]Oh, the gods are getting angry now.
[64:40.62]They're getting very angry, Frodo.
[64:43.63]One final thing that I've heard, that I see in this device, it was given to me by a goblin.
[64:52.52]Frodo, next weekend, you're gonna get invited to a party on Facebook.
[64:59.32]You're gonna say maybe, and you're gonna be kind of excited to go, but they're gonna cancel, they're gonna cancel it right before you say yes.
[65:10.94]because you would have been the 10th person which made them have the party in the first place.
[65:16.58]So you were the asshole.
[65:18.66]If you had just said yes, you would have been able to go.
[65:20.44]Oh, yup, that one is bad.
[65:25.18]Hot, hot, hot.
[65:28.14]Okay.
[65:30.31]Yeah, let me get out of this.
[65:32.41]Reddit wizard.
[65:45.67]Nice shoes.
[65:51.68]R Confessions Wizard.
[65:55.40]What is that?
[65:55.90]There's one like you can wear.
[65:59.44]R Confessions.
[66:00.76]Consult the Funko Pop.
[66:07.29]You need to do Deckard Cain.
[66:08.49]There's a lot of costume looks, but there's a lot of non-costumes.
[66:16.19]Sit in a stool in front of the green, order an adult, okay, I'll order some beverages.
[66:20.53]Yeah, actually, let me mute so you can, so this is not horrible.
[66:24.80]Do Sephiroth, like every white haired bearded person, I can't do them all.
[66:30.68]Hold on, give me one sec.
[68:04.84]OK, coming up next, I'm going to do solid snake.
[68:08.02]Somebody said, get in the box and do snake stuff.
[68:11.39]And then there's also hide behind cover as if you're being shot.
[68:13.81]OK, so I'm going to do some snake stuff.
[68:15.25]I need the little gun, too.
[68:21.12]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[68:27.56]Somebody picked a great time to do this.
[68:30.10]Like in the middle of the dead of summer in Vegas.
[68:32.85]100 plus degrees out right now.
[68:37.75]Actually, yeah, we do have water.
[68:38.57]I'll take some water.
[68:41.23]Yeah, I'm getting solid snake stuff ready.
[68:47.15]Okay.
[68:48.79]So, eye patch.
[68:51.39]Which eye does he have it on?
[68:54.49]Does it matter?
[68:54.89]I'm so sweaty.
[68:58.75]I'm like sweating through these clothes.
[69:16.62]Is it the left eye or the right eye?
[69:19.28]I just broke the fucking eye patch.
[69:22.70]Ow, fuck.
[69:23.48]Yeah, I'm alright.
[69:27.97]Shit.
[69:28.61]Well, how am I supposed to put it on now?
[69:34.51]I'll just get in front.
[69:35.09]You just guide me.
[69:38.59]Does he have a headband?
[69:48.00]Okay.
[69:50.94]I got it.
[69:51.20]I got it.
[69:53.88]Solid Snake doesn't have an eye patch?
[69:56.66]What?
[70:00.25]Doesn't snake have an eye patch?
[70:02.51]Is that like a scarf?
[70:04.41]It's a shirt.
[70:06.53]No.
[70:08.71]Does it look like this?
[70:09.27]I think it's messing with your mic.
[70:14.52]OK.
[70:15.52]Hold on.
[70:16.60]Does he have a sword?
[70:21.68]It's big boss.
[70:24.32]Is it messing with the mic?
[70:28.90]Alright, so the idea is that I get in this and do the solid-state stuff.
[70:32.40]Alright, I'm going to try.
[70:36.14]What if I don't knock anything over?
[70:48.71]OK, so it's like there's no way I fit in this thing.
[70:59.91]Okay.
[72:22.69]Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[72:25.45]You thought I was a box still.
[72:27.99]Dumbass.
[72:33.36]Oh.
[72:34.88]I still have these on.
[72:38.88]Oh, yeah, remember Solid Snake with his goblin booties?
[72:43.24]Alright, what do we got next?
[72:46.87]Yeah.
[72:55.31]Oh, God.
[72:56.09]That's going to be hard to do.
[72:58.46]Alright.
[72:59.12]I'll do it, though.
[72:59.78]That's going to be so awful.
[73:01.80]People are going to freak out at that one.
[73:10.02]Where are the teeth?
[73:15.91]I'm just keeping the boots on.
[73:16.71]I don't even care.
[73:19.05]Should I, like, slick my hair back for this one?
[73:20.45]Okay.
[73:28.36]Teeth, yeah.
[73:30.84]Yeah.
[73:32.64]Might as well get this one out of the way.
[73:37.00]I'm just sweating.
[73:37.64]There's no way it's going to be fit.
[73:38.91]I'm going to look like such a fucking creep like this.
[73:46.33]Should I have?
[73:48.85]Okay, this one is called The Vampire at the Door.
[74:04.11]Oh, hi.
[74:06.05]I'm new in the neighborhood.
[74:07.93]I noticed you have a really nice house.
[74:11.67]I'd love to come in.
[74:13.30]Could I come in?
[74:14.74]Could I come in your house?
[74:17.12]I'm new in the neighborhood.
[74:18.80]Me and my family just moved in down the street.
[74:22.10]And I just was trying to meet the neighbors.
[74:26.24]Just trying to meet the neighbors, that's all.
[74:32.62]Yeah.
[74:33.93]I love what you did with the yard, by the way.
[74:37.69]That beautiful grass.
[74:39.41]The grass looks beautiful.
[74:41.16]How do you get it that long?
[74:42.56]I don't know, maybe you give it some pointers.
[74:45.82]Yeah.
[74:47.04]Can I come in?
[74:47.72]Yeah, let me.
[74:48.94]Can I come in?
[74:51.84]Let me in your house, please.
[74:53.74]Can I come in?
[74:56.42]Oh, yeah, okay.
[74:58.23]Right, of course.
[74:59.83]I had some dental work done,
[75:02.65]They added extra length.
[75:05.33]I wanted width.
[75:06.79]I didn't want length, and that's what I got.
[75:12.38]Can I come into your house?
[75:14.26]Could I come in?
[75:15.64]Could I come into your house?
[75:18.22]No?
[75:18.84]No?
[75:19.42]Okay.
[75:20.70]Alright, call me.
[75:21.84]If you want to talk, call me.
[75:24.16]Call me.
[75:27.74]Can I come in?
[75:29.50]No?
[75:31.51]I'll wait here until I can.
[75:33.69]No, it's all good, don't worry about it.
[75:36.73]No, I barely sleep.
[75:41.03]Yeah, good night.
[75:44.35]You want some DVDs?
[75:46.05]You want some DVDs?
[75:47.42]I've got a lot of DVDs.
[75:50.24]Sharknado, for one.
[75:52.44]Loaded on DVDs.
[75:57.12]You like drugs?
[76:00.34]Do you like drugs?
[76:01.46]I got a lot.
[76:03.14]Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.
[76:06.29]Weed, coke.
[76:09.39]That's all I got.
[76:11.39]I don't got anything else, but you know, call me.
[76:16.19]Let me in your house!
[76:18.01]Let me in your house!
[76:19.79]Let me in your house!
[76:39.14]This is a fucking TikTok video.
[76:42.43]This is a, this is a TikTok video at this point.
[76:47.57]Can we, it's a TikTok video.
[76:51.27]You know what?
[76:51.73]I got a perfect, here you go.
[76:53.29]Perfect, perfect video if you want to submit it.
[76:56.21]Just add the TikTok UI to that whole thing and it'll be a fucking 10 out of 10.
[77:02.53]It'll be a literal 10 out of 10.
[77:04.67]And add music to it and put like a little, like a chat.
[77:15.05]Do Morbentime?
[77:16.17]Okay, fine.
[77:27.37]How would he say it?
[77:28.01]I don't know.
[77:33.18]It's Morbentime!
[77:34.70]Huh!
[77:37.98]That's kind of like Power Rangers, right?
[77:40.80]Is he like...
[77:59.37]It's Mormon time!
[78:16.64]Ugh!
[78:43.65]Hi, I'm Morbius.
[78:46.85]Go see Morbius 2 in theaters this July.
[78:52.05]Or at the $5 bin at your local Blockbuster.
[78:58.32]Either one will do.
[78:59.40]I got paid either way.
[79:00.36]Alright.
[79:08.90]Blech.
[79:14.69]This man went to college, yeah, a long time ago.
[79:24.92]I'm still in these stupid shoes.
[79:26.68]They're getting so dirty, holy shit.
[79:33.82]You should morb in front of the camera, I just did.
[79:35.76]Okay, oh my god, these are so beat up.
[79:44.40]Say, I'm Dr. Michael Morbius.
[79:48.30]Interesting to the camera?
[79:51.56]Actually, I probably should do some normal ones, right?
[79:54.46]Like, hey, hey, what's up?
[79:56.86]How are you?
[79:58.36]Yeah, I just moved in, yep.
[80:00.88]New to the neighborhood.
[80:01.94]Me, I love your house.
[80:03.88]I love what you're doing here.
[80:05.01]You know what I mean?
[80:06.55]I love this house.
[80:08.85]Really, really beautiful lawn you have, too.
[80:11.35]Yeah.
[80:12.01]I got kids.
[80:12.75]Yeah, we all get kids, right?
[80:14.71]Look, if you ever, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever, we'd have to get the families together, whatever, that's fine.
[80:23.04]Like I would just come, I would come over your, I would come in your house, I'd come over your house and I would, you'd let me in, right?
[80:28.49]Like I would come, we'd do a thing.
[80:30.03]Would you be interested?
[80:32.81]Okay.
[80:33.83]Okay.
[80:35.28]Mmm, could get some mojitos.
[80:37.58]I make an insane mojito.
[80:39.10]You don't understand.
[80:39.70]It's so good.
[80:42.24]You know the trick for a mojito?
[80:44.24]Extra mint.
[80:45.72]People don't like the taste of mint usually.
[80:48.62]Can I come in?
[80:49.34]Can I just come in?
[80:50.18]And we'll... Okay.
[80:53.01]I could show you how to make a mojito the right way.
[80:55.55]And not like the way that everybody else makes it without the extra mint.
[80:58.83]I have to come in though.
[80:59.63]Can I come in your house?
[81:10.01]And that's when you do the teeth thing.
[81:14.32]Oh, I know.
[81:14.76]I'm sweating through this like crazy.
[81:18.68]We're getting sweaty back.
[81:21.86]I can't put a clean shirt on.
[81:24.00]It would ruin everything.
[81:26.97]Alright, fine.
[81:27.51]I'll do goblin time.
[81:28.57]Jesus.
[81:29.95]Give me those.
[81:30.39]These are perfect for goblin time.
[81:39.44]You're sweating.
[81:40.14]Yeah, I know.
[81:40.82]Alright, what do we have for goblin time?
[81:55.28]So I'm like, oh, I got your money.
[81:57.78]Oh, be careful.
[82:01.10]Whoa, there's a lot in here.
[82:02.96]Do I have anything else besides this?
[82:04.29]I have probably a mustache on for this.
[82:11.67]Alright, let me get in the mirror and put this on.
[82:18.75]Put on a twirly one.
[82:19.79]I think this one will be alright for a little while.
[82:32.84]Why is this a goblin?
[82:34.06]I don't know.
[82:36.30]How is this a goblin?
[82:38.07]Goblin time?
[82:41.99]Should I have something weird besides the two sacks of money?
[82:44.65]Hey fellas, look what I just got in the dungeon.
[82:52.70]Oh yeah, that works.
[82:56.64]I'm gonna look like Barney Rubble.
[82:58.30]Alright, I'm just gonna put it on here.
[83:05.61]I'm gonna look like Barney Rubble.
[83:09.23]In fact, this is a Barney Rubble costume.
[83:13.80]We?
[83:16.00]Who?
[83:16.32]I don't know who that is.
[83:28.65]What is this going to look like?
[83:30.87]Oh, hey, Fred.
[83:33.77]Hey, Fred.
[83:34.49]Hey, yeah, hey, Fred.
[83:36.33]Oh, yeah, Fred.

[83:43.36]Yep.
[83:45.38]Okay, Fred.
[83:47.88]That's good to hear.
[83:48.52]Good to hear, Fred.
[83:50.37]Was I doing Goblin Time?
[83:54.01]Yes!
[83:56.47]Oh, I can't believe I stole this from those adventurers!
[84:05.31]Coins!
[84:06.19]Gems!
[84:07.97]Don't mind if I do.
[84:09.53]Don't mind if I do.
[84:14.13]What's this, a crown?
[84:15.93]Whose crown could this be?
[84:17.55]I think this is King Leonidas's.
[84:22.67]No.
[84:24.23]What's that?
[84:26.17]Looks like I'll be shutting off.
[84:29.17]I hear adventurers.
[84:38.42]Oh, okay.
[84:40.62]Oh, these are heavy.
[84:43.78]The king's treasures are so heavy.
[84:45.54]There must be so many things in here.
[84:47.60]Oh, let me take a look.
[84:49.14]Let me see.
[84:49.70]Ooh, look at this.
[84:55.54]Oh my goodness.
[84:58.85]So many things for me to play with.
[85:00.93]So many things to try.
[85:03.37]How many?
[85:08.91]Oh, my gracious.
[85:11.71]These are golden doubloons.
[85:18.91]The world's most valuable treasure.
[85:23.49]Oh, I'm going to be taking this back to my den immediately.
[85:43.10]Oh, try this on for size.
[85:46.50]Oops.
[85:47.66]Try this on for size.
[85:48.66]A power gem.
[85:53.56]Oh, explosive.
[86:00.09]Oh, another one.
[86:03.01]What do we have here?
[86:04.09]Oh, another explosive gem.
[86:10.47]Oh.
[86:11.97]Righteous, absolutely righteous.
[86:20.38]I'll be off then.
[86:22.82]Oh, don't jump.
[86:28.22]OK.
[86:37.34].
[86:37.36]Walk from off frame?
[86:42.66]Hold on, I gotta get rid of this shit out of here.
[86:47.96]You know what, we can move to caveman after this.
[86:53.41]A caveman wouldn't have a mustache though.
[87:02.77]I know, I mean I threw them everywhere.
[87:04.29]Isn't that what they wanted?
[87:07.29]Okay, so I'm to sneak?
[87:50.99]Alright, what's next?
[87:52.57]Caveman?
[87:56.70]Grandpa?
[88:06.71]Do American Psycho.
[88:09.71]Alright, hold on.
[88:11.29]It's time to drink some water.
[88:16.35]Oh, let's do this on a 120 degree Vegas day.
[88:21.72]No, I'm just kidding.
[88:26.31]Hell yeah, water.
[88:27.21]Alright, I'm going to mute because you're going to hear my throat muscles.
[88:33.78]That's gross.
[90:08.01]I can't.
[90:08.47]I don't know.
[90:09.17]I can't.
[90:10.57]I don't know about this one.
[90:11.61]I don't know about this one.
[90:16.94]I'm supposed to be discovering fire?
[90:21.80]Discover fire as a caveman.
[90:34.46]Alright.
[90:43.68]No, mine.
[91:28.10]Oh!
[91:29.92]Oh, shit!
[91:31.92]No!
[92:11.99]Why would he be fighting people?
[92:14.93]He's just beating the shit out of everybody else.
[92:17.62]He's just so fucked up that he can't handle it.
[92:28.32]They're stealing it.
[92:34.51]Beating up a dinosaur.
[92:44.88]oh oh oh oh oh
[93:41.94]The caveman wears jeans.
[93:46.91]Yes.
[93:51.74]This is what you do in your spare time?
[93:55.04]Yeah, kind of.
[93:55.90]That's kind of what we're doing right now.
[93:57.02]Alright, give me a sec.
[94:08.39]Costume change.
[95:38.70]Alright, just drinking some water.
[95:42.81]So what do we got?
[95:43.31]We got cashier.
[95:44.13]We got artist first.
[95:46.13]Yeah, we'll do artist.
[95:47.27]And then cashier, mine, and infomercial, and chef is all pretty much the same.
[96:01.14]So this is artist.
[96:01.76]What should I do for a mustache?
[96:02.92]Maybe mustache for chef.
[96:09.37]I can't wait to do that.
[96:10.15]That's going to be so fun.
[96:20.88]I mean, should I get these out of the way?
[96:21.98]Just because they're here.
[96:22.74]Yeah, these are some easy props.
[96:24.84]You want to just do you jamming out or you do a discount.
[96:27.28]Yeah.
[96:29.62]Can I put this on?
[96:30.34]Yeah, I want to tape it around me.
[96:33.49]Alright.
[96:35.55]I can also read you some non-plastic ones for a little bit.
[96:40.21]Do the guitarist?
[96:40.89]Yeah, I'm going to do the music stuff right now.
[96:46.15]I can't believe I twerked as the caveman.
[96:49.26]You find a fire, so you twerk.
[96:51.28]That feels like a Geico commercial, doesn't it?
[96:57.88]Alright, so I'm just going to do this from various angles.
[97:10.05]This shirt is gonna be a different shade of gray.
[97:20.78]It's gonna be so wet.
[97:27.34]Alright, coming back.
[97:35.02]Okay.
[97:39.48]This one's going to be interesting.
[97:47.43]So this one's play the piano in a band.
[97:51.57]Let's see what I can do.
[97:52.11]I should probably be sitting down for this.
[98:06.59]OK.
[98:12.23]How's it look?
[98:17.92]You probably all just heard that.
[98:18.94]That's fine.

[98:37.58]Well, maybe I should trade it in.
[98:39.49]Alright, yeah, we're going to play a new song.
[98:40.82]This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[98:43.34]I hope you all enjoy it.
[98:45.14]It doesn't have a name.
[98:45.94]It's currently untitled, so that's what we're going to do.
[98:49.46]It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.
[98:52.10]Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[98:56.47]It's going to be peppy.
[98:57.25]It's going to be a lot of upbeat, so hopefully see somebody out there dancing.

[119:38.95]Oh, no.
[119:39.37]I'll just hold it like this.

[123:38.87]Mario will drive at his feet.
[123:40.15]Get away.
[123:57.01]Get this away from me.
[124:15.61]You better move!
[124:30.08]I won!

[124:32.82]Toad?
[124:45.35]What else do you want from me?
[124:47.07]I want you to walk in this way and go out that way, like Hotel Mario.
[124:51.36]Hotel Mario?
[124:51.62]What the fuck?
[124:54.20]Walk in?
[125:02.18]Oh, OK.
[125:06.61]No.
[125:08.01]No.
[125:08.43]No.
[125:09.17]How do you do it?
[125:09.61]It's like, no.
[125:12.99]She's looking at me like I'm fucking crazy.
[125:16.76]No.
[125:17.24]Toast, it goes in the toaster.
[125:27.49]Toast, no.
[125:29.13]Toast, it goes in the toaster.
[125:30.73]Is that in the same thing?
[125:33.25]Is that in that?
[125:38.62]Tuck that in.
[125:42.06]There's a tag.
[125:42.92]Do the Mario.
[125:44.72]Do you think you can learn the song?
[125:49.73]It's swing your arms from side to side.
[125:52.39]Come on, it's time to go.
[125:53.80]Do the Mario.
[125:55.54]Okay.
[126:07.11]Swing your arms from side to side, come on, and everyone go do the Mario.
[126:12.13]Swing your arms from side to side, come on, let's go, let's do the Mario.
[126:20.15]That the Mario for you?
[126:22.15]Be who that one.
[126:23.75]Hey, be who that one, Bowser.
[126:30.49]Then they go like this, he's like,
[126:43.07]I don't know the whole song.
[126:49.81]Any more Mario shit?
[126:55.02]The accordion is Mario?
[126:59.38]Wait.
[127:02.34]I wrote this song for Luigi.
[127:19.80]And every single person watching wanted to turn the audio off.
[127:22.62]That was for you, Luigi.
[127:44.34]I can't wait to be the annoying waiter and come up and be like, oh, how are you?
[127:51.94]And I'll take an extra tip, by the way, at least 60%.
[127:55.04]Enjoy your dinner.
[127:55.76]I think that's it for Mario.
[128:12.46]Any more Mario?
[128:18.50]The cart's just in the corner.
[128:19.80]You already just did this, right?
[128:23.46]Yeah, go up the stairs.
[128:26.12]Do a Mario drug PSA?
[128:35.42]Hi, ladies and gentlemen.
[128:43.13]I'm Super Mario.

[128:50.40]But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know what's not fun?
[128:53.02]What is not totally byahoo?
[128:56.76]Drugs and alcohol.
[128:59.27]Stay away from them.
[129:01.37]If somebody tries to pressure you into drinking or smoking, tell them with the hardest of hearts, no, I don't need to do that.
[129:12.07]We can get back to the playing and games now.
[129:15.57]But I wanted to make sure that that was a big byahoo.
[129:21.56]I saw you laughing in the corner.
[129:23.42]What's wrong?
[129:24.88]What's wrong with me?
[129:26.59]What's wrong?
[129:28.77]What's wrong with me?

[130:02.45]But you know what's not byahoo, and what's not cool?
[130:05.97]Drugs and alcohol.
[130:07.79]If somebody pressures you into smoking or drinking,
[130:12.23]Tell them no.
[130:13.74]And you can tell them so long.
[130:16.04]So long, King Bowser.
[130:18.42]Take it from me.
[130:20.66]I live a pretty cool life, don't you think?

[132:06.84]I got it.
[132:07.14]It's impossible.
[132:23.62]I think it actually might be impossible.
[132:27.08]I'll give it one more try.
[132:29.42]Fuck, okay, I gotta like it.
[132:32.08]I gotta like just shut up and get into it.

[132:51.39]Oh, Bowser.
[132:56.77]Oh, boys and girls, it's-a me, Mario.
[133:01.64]Let me tell you something.
[133:03.61]If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.
[133:08.79]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time.
[133:13.06]And I said, no.
[133:14.56]And he said, Mario.
[133:15.84]And I said, no.
[133:17.56]God damn it.
[133:20.38]The mustache came off.
[133:25.90]Fuck.
[133:26.76]That one was the one, too.
[133:27.72]That was the take.
[133:28.32]And this, I could feel it, like, come off.
[133:31.20]Oh, fuck.
[133:33.60]I could feel it come off.
[133:39.53]Alright.
[133:39.85]I'm going to give this one more attempt, and we have to move on.
[133:43.15]I'm just so, I'm so sweaty.
[133:44.35]Okay.
[133:52.46]Hello.
[133:52.64]Alright.
[133:57.52]Okay, you can do this, Mario.
[133:59.42]You can do this, Mario.
[134:02.16]Meow-hoo!
[134:02.96]Meow-hoo!
[134:04.10]Oh!
[134:05.34]Bowser!
[134:08.20]Hello, boys and girls.
[134:09.98]It's-a me, Mario.
[134:12.10]Let me tell you something about drugs and alcohol.
[134:16.44]My brother Luigi would also say this, too.
[134:19.69]We both would say this.
[134:22.27]Shit!
[134:25.17]Meow-hoo!
[134:26.15]Meow-hoo!
[134:27.66]I gotta give it more than that.
[134:31.14]Meow-hoo!
[134:31.90]Meow-hoo!
[134:32.64]Whoa!
[134:34.08]Bowser!
[134:35.86]I'll deal with you later.
[134:38.62]Hello, boys and girls.
[134:41.30]It's-a me, Mario.
[134:43.42]Let me tell you something about... Just cut them together, okay?
[134:51.53]Let me tell you something about drugs and alcohol.
[134:55.40]You should never take any drugs.
[134:57.76]Never.
[134:58.14]Mario wouldn't.
[134:59.20]Luigi wouldn't.
[135:00.38]Toad?
[135:03.03]Maybe.
[135:04.17]But we don't need to talk about Toad.
[135:10.83]Hello, it's me, Mario.
[135:13.35]I want to talk to you about drugs.
[135:15.61]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[135:18.37]You don't have to do them.
[135:19.57]Don't feel pressured to take drugs or drink.
[135:22.43]If anyone ever pressures you, tell them Mario said, so long, King Bowser, and they will leave you alone.
[135:28.97]No!
[135:30.89]No, it's me, Mario.
[135:34.80]I have to do a drug PSA.
[135:36.98]Okay, I'm done.
[135:40.14]I can't do it.
[135:41.68]That was the end.
[135:45.88]He's on drugs.
[135:48.95]He's on drugs.
[135:51.17]He's like fucked up.
[135:52.69]He's fucking crazy.
[135:54.47]He's running around like a psychopath.
[135:57.43]He's on something.
[135:59.55]Oh my God.
[136:08.52]Do the Bowser throw?
[136:09.70]Alright, fine.
[136:10.54]So long, K-Bowser.
[136:27.35]And somebody like King Bowser needs to understand.
[136:30.53]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[136:33.45]If you do drugs, you'll end up like King Bowser over there.
[136:37.83]Dead.
[136:38.15]Is he dead?
[136:39.70]I don't know.
[136:51.70]Oh.

[137:25.53]Luigi, I almost just took down the whole camera.
[137:30.83]Did it move?
[137:33.27]I don't think it did, right?
[137:36.70]Let's just make sure you can still see me.
[137:38.72]Did the camera move?
[137:40.02]Maybe they can tell you.
[137:42.92]Did it move or are we good?
[137:49.46]How about now?
[137:52.88]Am I good here?
[137:53.32]You're still good.
[138:00.79]You've got quite a ways to go.
[138:01.51]OK, good.
[138:01.69]I think I moved it right.
[138:04.19]So that's fine.
[138:07.93]Any more Mario stuff before we move on?
[138:18.88]Do you lose a life?
[138:22.03]Do a ground pound, OK.
[138:23.69]Yeah, I keep trying to go this.
[138:24.77]I'm so stupid.
[138:25.95]I keep trying to go to the left.
[138:28.89]OK, ground pound.
[138:32.01]So it's like, like that.
[139:02.43]I'm fuckin' done with this job.
[139:08.15]Never fuckin' do a Mario ever again.
[139:17.13]No, I can't, I can't.

[139:41.57]Wait, wasn't this like Mario Odyssey?
[139:43.41]Huh?

[139:53.43]That means I solve problems.
[139:55.05]I solve practical problems.
[140:01.29]So wait, does the mustache off is the engineer?
[140:06.21]I guess that's true, right?
[140:13.22]Build a sentry as Mario?
[140:19.76]The stomach is going to get me in a lot of trouble.
[140:23.37]Oh, hey look bud.

[144:11.38]Hillbilly seeing a tornado.
[144:13.92]Maybe no gloves.
[144:15.76]With the Mario gloves on.
[144:22.95]Hillbilly seeing a tor... Is this the beard?
[144:25.97]No, that's the hat here.
[144:41.97]Isn't this what Mario just looks like without his hat on?
[144:45.86]If Mario doesn't have his hat on, this is what he looks like, right?
[144:49.28]When Mario's hat comes off in the games, he looks like this.
[144:56.30]No gloves?
[144:59.41]Oh, man.
[145:02.49]What's that?
[145:02.85]I think that's a tornado.
[145:07.67]Oh, that's a tornado right there.
[145:10.65]That's a tornado.
[145:12.40]We've got to get everybody inside.

[145:31.35]He landed in the bed.
[145:35.10]It's getting closer.
[145:36.20]It's getting closer.
[145:38.10]Oh, we're going to get him.
[145:40.12]Get the cows in, or the chickens!
[145:42.24]Get the chickens in!
[145:46.12]I'm done with this one.
[145:48.36]This one's over.
[145:57.46]None of that is usable.
[146:05.63]So Mario can come off?
[146:11.36]Give me the Mario hat for a second.
[146:12.44]Alright, stuff the hair in here.
[146:18.11]This is important.
[146:19.51]You want the mustache?
[146:20.49]Yeah, but try to get all the hair in here.
[146:30.38]As much of the hair you can get in there as possible.

[146:56.85]Thank you.
[147:01.94]Okay, I'm gonna give the, what, what's wrong?
[147:06.52]They're so wet.
[147:07.75]Yeah, they are.
[147:08.85]That's fucking gross.
[147:14.65]You didn't hear any of that.
[147:15.51]Alright, I got one, yeah, these, oh my God, these are gross.
[147:22.05]It's like as if you dunk these in water.
[147:23.71]Alright, I gotta try this once, and I just, I don't know why I'm so into the drug PSA thing.
[147:32.66]Bia-hoo!
[147:33.38]Bia-hoo!
[147:34.52]Oh!
[147:35.08]Bowser!
[147:37.12]Oh!
[147:38.48]Hi, kids.
[147:40.94]My name's Shawn Stevenson.
[147:42.88]I'm the actor that plays Super Mario on TV.
[147:47.13]But what's not funny and what's not bia-hoo is drugs and alcohol.
[147:52.31]If anyone ever tries to pressure you into taking drugs, you just give them a no.
[147:57.47]A no!
[147:59.50]And if you get older and you decide to drink when you're 21, make sure you do it in moderation.
[148:05.22]Make sure you're careful.
[148:06.68]Be very careful, honestly.
[148:11.24]This fucking hair.
[148:18.82]Whatever.
[148:19.22]The actor reveal that's not Mario's hair.
[148:32.71]You look like you just got out of jail.
[148:36.81]No, but honestly, though, don't do fucking drugs.
[148:39.64]Don't be an idiot.
[148:43.20]Don't be an idiot.
[148:43.70]Alright, what's next?
[148:54.30]You're on drugs.
[148:55.38]No, I'm kidding.
[148:56.60]Marijuana in moderation if you're old enough and you can be careful with it.
[149:00.04]Alcohol if you're old enough, be careful with it.
[149:01.51]You don't need to do anything else.
[149:04.51]You understand?
[149:04.91]Be careful.
[149:06.63]Real PSA, be careful.
[149:08.09]Don't be dumb.
[149:12.82]Is it bad?
[149:18.08]Is it really that bad?
[149:20.96]I should probably have, yeah.
[149:22.12]Give me a new shirt.
[149:29.72]Alright, costume change up here, back.
[153:41.08]Almost back, one sec.
[153:44.46]Dude, these little things are insane, by the way.
[153:45.92]These things are awesome.
[153:47.80]This little guy right here, I'll just show it.
[153:51.53]So this is a microphone.
[153:54.05]This is like a little wireless, yeah, I know, I know.
[153:57.69]This is a microphone.
[154:01.14]You just clip it on and it works.
[154:03.90]This thing is really, I actually really like this.
[154:05.94]Hopefully it's been sounding okay.
[154:10.97]Vincent Van Gogh, yeah.
[154:12.94]Probably this one.
[154:14.16]There's going to be... Oh, spoilers, yeah.
[154:18.52]Let's mute.
[154:56.72]Chat, does that sound fine?
[154:59.03]Does that sound okay?
[155:01.53]Did we sound good?
[155:03.55]Yeah, it's okay?
[155:04.39]Yeah, I'm telling you, if these things worked out, I'm gonna shout this fucking company out, I swear to God.
[155:14.17]Not yet though, not yet, not yet.
[155:20.46]This is a painter routine.
[155:22.14]Do you want me to paint and comment on what I'm painting on the big screen or whatever?
[155:27.41]Yeah, what was the description?
[155:41.12]Okay.
[155:43.80]Take a little bit of this.
[155:51.16]A little bit of this.
[155:53.34]Oh, that looks good, don't you think?
[155:56.20]How do you say, looks very good?
[156:03.64]Looking pretty good.
[156:17.23]It's masterpiece.
[156:18.91]No?
[156:19.97]No?
[156:23.19]It's masterpiece, no?
[156:24.70]No?
[156:27.50]What do you know about art?
[156:28.46]You know nothing about art.
[156:29.42]You don't know anything.
[156:31.20]You know nothing about art.
[156:38.08]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[156:40.10]Let's add a little bit of this.
[156:44.42]A little bit of green.
[156:48.55]Extra green.
[156:51.21]Like that.
[156:53.27]Just a little.
[156:56.75]One more final touch.
[156:58.61]What do you think, huh?
[156:59.83]What do you think of my painting?
[157:04.70]Let me get a little closer.
[157:09.82]Why would I need to get closer?
[157:10.96]I was right here.
[157:12.24]Alright, now let's do a big one.
[157:15.20]Oh, yes.

[157:19.54]Look at what I've made for you.
[157:22.20]It's beautiful.
[157:23.50]It's beautiful, no?
[157:26.22]The colors.
[157:29.27]It looks fantastic.
[157:31.61]One of the best I've ever painted.
[157:36.37]Finishing touches, add a little bit more red.
[157:40.81]Oh.
[157:43.11]Looks very good.
[157:44.64]Very good.
[157:49.04]I don't like this.
[157:50.52]I don't like this part.
[157:52.63]Right here.
[157:54.32]No.
[157:55.52]Let me change it.
[158:07.00]That's... Magnifique!
[158:10.42]Absolutely magnifique!
[158:11.80]Magnifique!
[158:17.44]Last final touch, I swear I will not touch it again.
[158:21.24]Oh, beautiful, beautiful painting.

[165:39.40]Yep.
[165:42.93]Weird that somebody ordered a fucking coffee.
[165:44.37]Usually people order milk, sugar, and cream, and then they mix it up and they Ster it up and they add like fucking hazelnut syrup to it.
[165:49.27]What's going on here?
[165:49.95]What the fuck is going on?
[165:51.81]That person's a fucking weird person, and I want to get him out of my store now.
[165:56.92]Hey, yo, you got to leave.

[167:17.80]Dad grilling burgers.
[167:18.94]Well, I probably wouldn't be wearing this.
[167:20.10]I'll do dad grilling burgers.
[167:28.05]Ah, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
[167:31.35]Yeah.
[167:33.05]Just on grilling duty.
[167:36.05]Be careful over there.
[167:37.03]Be careful.
[167:37.67]Don't be too rough.
[167:40.83]Ah, nothing like a beautiful grill.
[167:43.59]Beautiful day.
[167:46.49]Yeah, yup.
[167:48.59]I'm doing it.
[167:50.37]I'm doing it.
[167:50.93]It's a worse job, by the way.
[167:55.13]I don't know.
[167:56.08]Nobody can hear me, but still.
[167:59.04]Just sit up here all fucking goddamn day with 15 patties here.
[168:05.09]Four of them are going to get eaten.
[168:07.65]Stupid fucking idiots in this family.
[168:10.63]Yep, I can see you.
[168:12.31]What are you doing?
[168:16.09]That's a funny hat.
[168:17.39]That's a funny hat that you have on.
[168:22.62]Yep, you're my boy.
[168:24.02]Yeah, you are.
[168:25.46]Goodness.
[168:27.46]Kid's a fucking idiot.
[168:31.48]Does anybody want a burger?
[168:32.64]Burgers are almost done.
[168:33.44]God damn it.
[168:37.74]There it is.
[168:39.89]Kid's a fucking dumbass.
[168:40.85]I don't know what to do about that.
[168:45.21]I mean, I shouldn't be flipping these as much, but I am.
[168:47.03]I mean, what do you do up here besides just flip?
[168:51.62]You flip, you flip, you flip, you flip, and you just wait for somebody to come tap you on the shoulder.
[168:55.00]Making sure nobody's fucking around me.
[168:59.85]Oh, hey, hey, Dad.
[169:01.13]Oh, there's the grill master.
[169:02.36]There he is, the grill master.
[169:03.64]Yeah, yeah, because nobody else wants to fucking do it.
[169:09.34]So I do it, and I sit here all day.
[169:11.44]You're going to think I want to be back there.
[169:14.08]What's that?
[169:14.45]No, no.
[169:16.19]You're doing a great job out there, son.
[169:20.01]Don't climb that.
[169:21.57]Don't get down from there.
[169:23.05]Don't climb that.
[169:23.83]Out of your mind?
[169:25.01]Don't climb that.
[169:27.67]He's a maniac, I know, right?
[169:30.65]He's my son, right?
[169:31.67]Yeah, I know.
[169:34.08]You ready for a dog?
[169:36.70]You don't want a dog.
[169:38.64]Does anybody want dogs?
[169:43.74]No one wants a dog.
[169:49.52]What did I make?
[169:50.32]What did I put fucking seven on here?
[169:53.38]Who's going to eat them?
[169:56.97]It's so stupid, it's stupid.
[170:01.71]When I take a tally, when I take, when I take a tally and I say, what do you want?
[170:07.70]Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?
[170:09.64]And I hear, dog, dog, dog, I'll take a fucking dog.
[170:13.06]What's that?
[170:13.46]Yeah.
[170:16.22]Yeah, that's awesome.
[170:18.80]Don't you throw them in the pool?
[170:20.56]Don't throw them in the pool.
[170:23.62]When I say how many fucking hot dogs I'm going to make, it's seven?
[170:27.54]Nobody eats them.
[170:28.36]Nobody eats seven dogs.
[170:33.07]You know, I'm going to eat one.
[170:37.33]Those are fucking gross.
[170:38.19]Those are raw.
[170:38.79]I don't even know what I'm doing up here.
[170:42.09]That was pretty much raw.
[170:43.09]That was a raw hot dog that I ate.
[170:46.43]I wish somebody else could, we should hire someone to do this next time so I don't have to sit here and do this fucking three hours.
[170:53.53]What's that?
[170:54.79]Yeah, you want a burger?
[170:57.15]You do?
[171:00.05]And you want a dog too?
[171:04.59]Yeah, come on over here.

[171:10.96]Please, go for it.
[171:14.72]Whose kid is this?

[171:18.92]I'm telling you.
[171:19.56]I'm telling you.
[171:21.22]Little Michael is going to Harvard.
[171:23.00]I'm telling you.
[171:25.22]He's going to Harvard.
[171:27.32]Thank you.
[171:27.88]Yeah.
[171:28.70]You like it?
[171:31.29]It's just delicious.
[171:35.09]This is what it's about.
[171:36.23]It's about grilling out here with the family, with the friends.
[171:39.61]And yeah, alright.
[171:41.41]OK.
[171:42.97]OK.
[171:43.31]How much longer do I do this for?
[171:51.43]Who's gonna use this?
[171:53.75]Who's gonna use this?
[171:56.95]No one is going to use it.
[171:58.68]Do you guys... I can't just like sit up here and just like fucking do like a one man monologue show.
[172:06.70]Do you remember when I did the... Do you remember when I did the whole saw routine?
[172:12.32]I was in the chair.
[172:13.14]I was in there for, I was probably what, five, 10 minutes straight of doing like this whole routine.
[172:18.72]Out of like four or five hundred videos, I think one person used it.
[172:25.13]And it was for like five seconds total.
[172:28.99]I'm just doing like an acting study.
[172:31.75]Who's gonna use it for anything?
[172:34.74]So this is a driving instructor?
[172:36.84]Okay.
[172:38.64]I need the mustache back on.
[172:42.04]Let me see what it looks like.
[172:44.80]I'm just, I was doing it for like 10 minutes.
[172:48.35]Nobody stopped me.
[172:53.77]Nobody stopped me.
[172:56.53]I looked at Holly, Holly was just sitting there staring at me like, she kind of gave me like the, are you still going?
[173:01.61]And I'm like, I guess.
[173:02.59]I don't think so.
[173:08.69]Alright, driving instructor.
[173:13.15]I look like a fucking weirdo.
[173:14.57]OK, driving instructor.
[173:23.01]Look at the close of it.
[173:27.01]Alright, so should I be this way?
[173:31.29]If I'm sitting down with a clipboard and I'm writing?
[173:33.61]I don't know.
[173:34.44]Should I be facing a few different angles?
[173:37.92]Yeah, but you talking to the camera, yeah.
[173:40.72]OK, let me know if I'm in frame when I get over there.
[173:47.26]Triple caution?
[173:49.90]OK, so here we go.
[173:52.38]How's this?
[173:57.91]Although, my fly is not down, right?
[174:00.09]I'm not going to get in trouble.
[174:01.19]How's this?
[174:03.63]Is this alright?
[174:07.25]So like from here up?
[174:09.47]Yeah.
[174:09.83]It doesn't open, does it?
[174:16.68]I'm going to hold it here.
[174:17.42]OK.
[174:22.18]So I'm going to say if I'm a passenger, the driver is over here.
[174:29.20]How we doing?
[174:29.68]How are we?
[174:30.16]Good?
[174:32.15]You can begin at any point.
[174:33.11]I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing, by the way.
[174:39.64]You can go ahead.
[174:40.28]You can come out here and take a right.
[174:46.42]Easy on the gas.
[174:47.28]Easy.
[174:47.54]Hold it back.
[174:50.82]Little on the gas there.
[174:53.54]You can get on the highway here.
[174:57.16]Stop.
[174:58.58]Slow down.
[175:03.36]I'm going to have to take a few points for that one.
[175:06.55]But you didn't signal.
[175:07.33]You didn't signal when you went right.
[175:08.59]And that's the first thing that we're going to do here.
[175:10.21]By the way, if you get four or five points wrong here, your license is not going to come through.
[175:16.57]And I am a stickler.
[175:18.22]Very much so for these points.
[175:20.74]Just keep that in mind.
[175:24.56]You can merge over here if you want.
[175:30.82]Slowly merge.
[175:32.20]Slowly merge.
[175:34.37]Way too fast.
[175:37.12]Actually too fast.
[175:41.30]Okay, I don't know what that was, but just stay in your lane here, please.
[175:45.64]Thank you.
[175:50.04]Very nice.
[175:51.78]Now that was a good one.
[175:52.54]That was actually a pretty good merge.
[175:57.16]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[175:58.62]Watch it.
[175:59.62]Keep your eyes on the road here, please.
[176:07.98]Be careful.
[176:08.64]Be careful.
[176:09.11]Be careful.
[176:10.81]Do you mind?
[176:11.75]Just go ahead.
[176:13.27]This is my car.
[176:14.45]In the glove box over here with me.
[176:16.43]See if I can grab these glasses.
[176:20.07]Just keep driving.
[176:20.91]You're fine.
[176:21.63]You're fine.
[176:22.05]Keep driving.
[176:23.73]Keep driving.
[176:24.19]You're right.
[176:26.22]It's a very big car.
[176:27.58]Yeah, this is why I have it.
[176:29.08]Just make sure I can see what you're up to.
[176:33.48]There it is.
[176:37.25]Could you pull this way and park for me, please?
[176:41.19]This is the parallel parking part of the exam.
[176:44.55]Over here, parallel park in this spot right here.
[176:46.43]There's two spots available.
[176:47.71]Not the one in front of the red truck.
[176:49.11]The one behind it.
[176:51.09]Behind the red truck.
[176:53.40]Use your eyes.
[176:55.50]Do you want these?
[176:56.06]Do you want these?
[176:57.82]Do you want to put these on?
[177:01.26]I told you I was a stickler, and I'm going to be that.
[177:05.38]Right there, parallel park behind the red truck.
[177:08.52]I'm not going to say it another time.
[177:10.34]Get up there in parallel park.
[177:15.04]You just hit it.
[177:16.62]You hit it.
[177:17.36]You bumped his bumper.
[177:19.62]Get your tire perpendicular to the window.
[177:22.84]Tire perpendicular to the window, back up at a 40 degree angle, turn around, back up, drive straight, turn right at 45 degrees, pull in.
[177:31.89]You learned this already.
[177:33.71]I am very much unhappy.
[177:41.73]That's going to get you two grades off, I think.
[177:43.90]You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[177:46.22]Make that very clear.
[177:51.52]Very bumpy, very bumpy.
[177:54.66]Alright, that's enough.
[177:55.64]That's enough.
[177:59.65]What I have here is I have two bumped cars.
[178:03.41]I have, would you like to see the notes?
[178:05.93]You can see it if you want.
[178:06.81]Would you like to see what I've written down?
[178:07.93]Go ahead and look.
[178:10.59]You bumped a car.
[178:12.27]You couldn't go more than, you went 40, 50 miles per hour getting on the on-ramp to the highway.
[178:16.49]And not only that, you don't know how to parallel park.
[178:19.49]And guess what?
[178:20.19]I don't either.
[178:21.99]But I'm not the one getting this test taken.
[178:25.94]Is there anything that you can pass?
[178:29.55]Give me the wheel.
[178:31.17]Let me show you how it's done.
[178:32.13]Here, you hold this.
[178:33.47]Yeah, you grade me.
[178:35.41]You grade me.
[178:36.91]You go ahead and grade me.
[178:40.60]Easily let off the gas, put the brake on, let go of the brake very, very easily.
[178:46.24]Easily, easily, thank you.
[178:47.54]Okay.
[178:50.92]Put the gas on.
[178:53.38]Oh shit, okay, yep.
[178:55.65]This is how you do it.
[178:56.39]This is how you drive a goddamn car.
[178:59.72]You can go to sleep if you want.
[179:01.20]I got this.
[179:01.62]OK.
[179:06.66]Very nice.
[179:07.76]Pull it in.
[179:08.28]Parallel park it.
[179:09.14]This is how we parallel park.
[179:13.40]Step on the gas.
[179:16.20]Step on the brake.
[179:17.64]Step on the gas again.
[179:20.51]And we're in the spot.
[179:22.93]How did I do, coach?
[179:24.65]What did you put down for me?
[179:25.83]Did you give me an A?
[179:26.39]Get out of the car.
[179:32.92]Okay, so now I have to be going this way?
[179:36.84]So, okay, okay.
[179:44.29]Am I on the right side here?
[179:45.25]Yep, you're good.
[179:52.47]Pencil, there.
[179:59.20]The doctor of God.
[180:04.57]So these are for you guys to do cuts if you want to do cuts.
[180:13.31]I'm not so sure about that.
[180:17.07]OK.
[180:17.73]I don't know about that.
[180:24.09]What you need to do is you need to relax and get a step on that gas.
[180:32.74]you you screwed that up what you needed to do there is you had to not happy about it very much unhappy about that you're pretty dumb can I just tell you you're dumb no human drives a car like this no human you can get a chimpanzee in this car and you probably do better than testing you did
[180:58.39]Jack, you can get an armadillo to do this test and probably do better than you just did.
[181:02.25]You can get an ant.
[181:03.21]You give me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel, 4,000 or 5,000 ants, and I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.
[181:13.43]Keep going.
[181:13.82]You don't think I could do that?
[181:17.34]You don't think I could train ants to do that?
[181:18.62]What's that?
[181:19.78]You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants?
[181:25.64]They'd be running circles around you, by the way.
[181:29.38]Oh, what a terrible.
[181:31.26]Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[181:44.14]Do you see what's in front of us?
[181:45.23]You do, right?
[181:46.57]What's in front of us?
[181:48.31]Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[181:52.83]Keep going.
[181:59.22]I think the microphone's fucked up.
[182:01.66]There we go.
[182:06.18]Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull into that McDonald's.
[182:11.60]Very important part of your test.
[182:12.65]Driving through a drive-through is actually very hard.
[182:16.09]It's a very narrow road.
[182:17.43]It's a very narrow part of, it's hard to kind of navigate in there.
[182:24.19]Right in here, right there, right there.
[182:26.52]Pull in smoothly, smooth it out.
[182:29.49]Stop, roll your window down.
[182:34.96]Get out of the way.
[182:38.08]Yeah, I'll take two double cheeseburgers, three McChickens.
[182:46.04]Yep.
[182:49.23]Yeah, no, two double cheeseburgers.
[182:52.39]Three McChickens, yep.
[182:55.13]And can I have no sauce on the McChickens?
[182:58.59]No sauce, please.
[183:02.44]You can't do that here?
[183:04.82]I'm marking that down on your exam.
[183:09.34]Took me to a McDonald's without any fucking sauce.
[183:11.98]You can't take it off?
[183:13.32]No, that's okay.
[183:14.09]That's alright.
[183:15.33]Do you want anything?
[183:20.85]And a small drink.
[183:23.49]One small Coke, please.
[183:25.83]And that's it.
[183:28.60]By the way, they rented my sauce.
[183:30.72]They rented my sauce, my Szechuan sauce.
[183:33.00]That's all going on your record here.
[183:39.10]Yeah, pull around.
[183:39.90]Thank you.
[183:44.25]Hey, howdy.
[183:44.75]How are you?
[183:46.09]Yep, I'll take it.
[183:48.01]Can you put it over here?
[183:50.01]I'm just doing a fucking acting class.
[183:51.93]Should I stop you?
[184:00.61]Every character is mean.
[184:06.25]Every character is mean.
[184:07.87]We could do this.
[184:13.57]Farming minus twos.
[184:14.85]What are you talking about?
[184:16.33]Oh my god, I need to go play.
[184:19.42]Alright, I got to end this one.
[184:20.58]I got to end this bit.
[184:22.52]So I'm going to get out of the car.
[184:26.30]That looks good.
[184:26.94]Alright, that's good.
[184:29.27]Not a, not a bad showing.
[184:30.59]Alright.
[184:30.89]Let me get out of the car and take a look at the car.
[184:35.81]Okay.
[184:36.19]Let me see the car.
[184:38.31]Turn it around.
[184:38.87]Turn the car around.
[184:42.25]Back it up.
[184:45.41]Good job.
[184:46.73]Good job.
[184:47.31]Pull it back here.
[184:48.91]Right here.
[184:49.27]Right in front of me.
[184:50.17]Right.
[184:50.33]I keep going.
[184:51.85]Keep going.
[184:52.29]Keep going.
[184:54.13]Stop.
[184:55.51]Nice.
[184:55.85]Stop.
[184:56.73]Nice.
[184:57.05]Commanded.
[184:57.53]Stop.
[185:00.81]OK, well, you got an F. And you're not going to get your license.
[185:07.69]But if you want to share some McDonald's, I'm your guy.
[185:11.59]So we go ahead and do that.
[185:12.46]End the scene.
[185:13.04]No one's going to use that part.
[185:15.08]OK, what's next?
[185:23.76]Take off the socks.
[185:26.60]I can't.
[185:27.48]Get hit by the car.
[185:29.49]God damn it, I keep going this way.
[185:31.35]Why do I keep going that way?
[185:35.05]I keep going the way I can't go.
[185:37.07]Hold on, let me move this.
[185:45.93]OK, that's fine.
[185:49.55]There is also play musical chairs by yourself.
[185:50.65]Play musical chairs by yourself, OK.
[185:51.77]Do you want to use that chair or do you want to use this one?
[185:56.32]This one's fine.
[185:58.10]That's a very quick one.
[186:02.57]Should I put the mustache back on?
[186:04.39]You know what it is?
[186:09.41]It's when I put a mustache on, I'm like a mean guy.
[186:13.48]I think this is the excuse to be kind of like a dick to everybody.
[186:17.26]I don't know why.
[186:17.80]Alright, musical chairs with one person.
[186:20.14]Alright, here we go.
[186:53.04]I got it.
[186:53.38]I got it.

[187:13.48]Am I in the same outfit?
[187:14.78]Hey, let me tell you something.
[187:17.46]Let me tell you something, fuck face.
[187:18.80]I got a mustache on, I'm pissed.
[187:24.68]This is a weird ASMR video.
[187:33.80]This is an ASMR video.
[187:36.70]Oh, maybe.
[187:39.06]We're supposed to have like syringes,
[187:41.57]Okay, this is actually, if I scream... Those latex gloves are terrifying.
[187:52.50]Just, I mean, give them to me, why not, I guess.
[187:56.34]Why would somebody, why would a doctor walk in like this?
[188:00.83]Okay, let's go ahead and start your checkup.
[188:03.55]Like every other ASMR video, how do you feel?
[188:06.11]How are you doing?
[188:08.33]Oh my God.
[188:12.72]Okay.
[188:16.78]Hello, patient.
[188:17.72]This is an ASI.
[188:18.32]I can't do this.
[188:18.82]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[188:28.54]How are you?
[188:29.00]How are you feeling?
[188:32.76]So it says here you have a little bit of a tummy ache.
[188:35.26]Yeah.
[188:36.88]When did it start?
[188:41.03]Last weekend, okay.
[188:43.14]Any bloating, any gas, any flatulence that I need to know of?
[188:46.97]A little bit, okay.
[188:53.67]How often are you using the bathroom?
[189:03.51]Me, me, me, me.
[189:05.88]I fucking can't do this one.
[189:07.78]I can't do this one, this one's too weird.
[189:10.14]I can't do it.
[189:12.22]This one's fucked up.
[189:15.34]Okay, I'll at least do this.
[189:18.12]Ow!
[189:19.64]That hurts so bad.
[189:23.47]Ow, my brain.
[189:25.11]Ow, my brain.
[189:25.99]Okay, take, I gotta, this is a real stethoscope.
[189:30.29]Ow, my fucking head.
[189:31.29]Okay.
[189:34.27]Oh, how are you?
[189:35.86]Do you mind, let me check and see how you're doing.
[189:41.23]Very, very healthy sounding.
[189:43.03]Very healthy.
[189:43.57]Okay.
[189:47.92]Can you follow my pen, please?
[189:52.28]Very good, very good, excellent, excellent.
[189:55.00]Can you, just real quick.
[190:02.13]Can I stick both my fingers up your nose?
[190:06.55]You said you had a runny nose?
[190:13.48]I think you might have the cold.
[190:17.56]Anything else bothering you today?
[190:18.58]Let me see.
[190:20.87]It's a little fast.
[190:28.23]A little fast.
[190:30.55]Well, it's not the common cold.
[190:32.72]I may unfortunately have to diagnose you with cringe.
[190:36.40]That's what you're suffering from.
[190:43.39]Get a prescription for it.
[190:46.39]Prescription is at least four to six hours of Call of Duty every day.
[190:53.08]Make sure that you're not as cringy as you are.
[190:55.68]Take some of that cringe off.
[190:58.14]And by the way, that is for Xbox 360.
[191:00.40]No other console.
[191:05.26]Not on PlayStation.
[191:08.03]And you can just take this whole thing.
[191:09.97]Go ahead.
[191:10.29]Take the whole thing.
[191:16.69]Ow, my fucking ears.
[191:20.07]Somebody said, what?
[191:22.15]That I'm a slut?
[191:23.34]No, no, no.
[191:24.98]Wait, what?
[191:25.52]I didn't hear you.
[191:26.50]I'll tell you later.
[191:29.40]Somebody called you a slut.
[191:30.96]I was like, what?
[191:32.12]Alright, who's next?
[191:39.38]What's next?
[191:39.80]Sleazy salesman.
[191:41.25]Sleazy selling what?
[191:42.21]I don't know.
[191:44.01]There's that over there, too, if you want to work.
[191:50.23]You know what would be kind of funny, actually?
[191:59.54]If somebody used the doctor's stuff for, he's listening to his own penis?
[192:05.67]Wait, like is that?
[192:10.87]I feel like there's going to be some combinations.
[192:13.33]The best part about doing this stuff is people are going, you know, people are saying, dude, what the hell are we gonna use this for, right?
[192:19.53]But the creativity of the community is just, it blows me away, because last time we said the same shit, and you guys combined a bunch of things and made it into the same video, so I'm very excited to see what the hell you guys can come up with, especially with the weird shit that's happening today.
[192:38.96]You're walking around with a briefcase of Paranoid, and there's also Sleazy Salesman.
[192:43.20]Alright, so walking around with a briefcase.
[192:45.47]And do you want this?
[192:47.35]I think this is a fine outfit.
[192:48.73]OK.
[192:51.41]There's also you on the phone, and then you.
[192:54.73]Oh, smash it?
[192:55.41]It could go with that, if you want.
[193:09.74]Yeah.
[193:11.00]Hold on, let me get rid of the chair.
[193:12.18]I think he's over there.
[193:24.35]I got, there's a whole Spider-Man costume here now.
[193:26.63]Alright.
[193:30.23]We're doing, we're doing sleazy like stockbroker?
[193:42.10]Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[193:43.78]I ain't going to be doing that.
[193:45.93]You can sell that one.
[193:46.95]Sell it.
[193:48.79]Yeah.
[193:49.09]Who is going to buy that?
[193:50.91]Are you serious?
[193:53.73]No, that company's going under.
[193:54.99]There's no way they're going to have, no.
[193:56.57]Their earnings are probably terrible.
[193:58.20]Sell it.
[194:01.69]No, I think, honestly, look, I'm going to work.
[194:04.23]I'm on the way to work right now.
[194:08.90]We can talk this later.
[194:11.42]But I want you to buy any company that makes, what the hell are they called?
[194:18.06]I don't know, the kids all watch it, TikTok.
[194:21.26]Can you buy TikTok?
[194:22.22]How do you buy that?
[194:24.67]My son's into it, big time.
[194:28.51]Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to buy it.
[194:30.83]Is it possible?
[194:32.09]Not really?
[194:35.85]Alright, well, you find me a company that is just like TikTok then and buy that one then.
[194:42.02]Go fuck yourself.
[194:45.16]Why would somebody do that?
[194:49.20]Wait, hold on.
[194:49.94]Hold on, there's a message.
[194:52.40]Hold on, wait, there's a special message from Mr. Giraffe.
[194:56.34]I've got to answer it.
[195:00.03]Hello?
[195:02.27]Mr. Giraffe, oh my goodness, I'm so glad to hear from you.
[195:06.46]Did you find that company?
[195:08.26]Yeah, yeah, no, no, I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.
[195:11.12]I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.
[195:13.40]No, of course not.
[195:15.25]No, I don't, Mr. Giraffe, I don't wanna buy Google stock.
[195:19.23]I wanna buy the TikTok company.
[195:24.36]Okay, alright, alright, fine, fine, fine.
[195:26.30]This is way too big for a briefcase.
[195:29.82]This is a fucking huge briefcase.
[195:33.30]Who would have this?
[195:35.32]This is fucking ridiculous.
[195:38.12]This is, look at how huge this is.
[195:40.80]Like, what is even in this?
[195:44.87]Like, what is in this thing?
[195:46.99]Alright, well, I got mad.
[195:50.13]There it is.
[195:57.54]Alright, let's do the mime stuff.
[196:01.68]Alright, we're going to do another costume change.
[196:06.03]Do Saul Goodman?
[196:07.17]I don't even know what to do.
[196:10.21]What do you mean Saul Goodman?
[196:14.87]Well, I didn't already do that.
[196:22.22]Saul Goodman.
[196:26.49]What's the line?
[196:29.11]Guys, I haven't seen past season two of Saul Goodman.
[196:33.05]Just say Saul Goodman.
[196:43.26]What is it?
[196:44.60]Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[196:45.02]Did you know the Constitution says you have rights?
[196:49.34]Well, so do I. I'm in a Cinnabon outfit.
[196:50.68]I don't know.
[196:52.70]I haven't seen past season two of Saul Goodman.
[196:54.66]I don't know.
[196:58.60]Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[197:01.24]And do you know that you have rights?
[197:03.44]Call me.
[197:05.62]What is it again?
[197:08.32]Oh, yeah, what is it?
[197:11.81]Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[197:15.09]Do you know that you have rights?
[197:16.79]The Constitution says you do, and so do I. I've lived until proven guilty.
[197:20.09]Every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent.
[197:22.43]And that's why I fight for you.
[197:23.71]Albuquerque, better call Saul.
[197:25.37]This is like a long thing.
[197:26.55]Do you want me to write it down?
[197:34.59]Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[197:36.47]And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman.
[197:38.15]Did you know that you have rights?
[197:39.91]And so do I, Albuquerque.
[197:41.97]I'm here to fight for you and to fight for your rights and fight for you in a court of law.
[197:47.43]Give me a call.
[197:48.55]Better call Saul.
[197:49.87]Better call Saul Goodman.
[197:52.67]Close enough, print it.
[197:53.67]I'm not doing another take.
[197:55.21]I'm an actor and I'm a good one.
[197:57.38]A good actor can take a script and can change it and make it sound better in front of the camera.
[198:02.92]I'm an actor.
[198:04.59]Are you an actor?
[198:06.09]Can you do this?
[198:08.99]No, you can't.
[198:10.37]You can't do that.
[198:12.43]Prove it to me if you could.
[198:14.05]I'm an actor.
[198:16.53]Can you do this?
[198:21.71]Nope.
[198:23.47]I'm an actor.
[198:24.71]I act for a living.
[198:44.18]You're embarrassing yourself.
[198:45.42]Welcome to the last 12 years of my life.
[198:47.10]Alright, what's next?
[198:52.87]Chef, okay.
[198:54.99]I feel like dad grilling burgers and chef are gonna be pretty similar.
[199:14.90]Alright, how's that?
[199:15.88]Does it look okay?
[199:20.30]I need like a thing to sit this on, like a table or something, right?
[199:23.70]Or would I just be holding it in the air?
[199:25.44]We could move one of those over.
[199:26.74]What do you think?
[199:28.97]That could be like a burner.
[199:30.69]I wonder if you could clip that out.
[199:40.71]How's that?
[199:47.21]Should I be back a little more?
[199:48.21]That's good.
[200:08.26]Yes.
[200:13.39]I need two chops.
[200:14.27]I need two chops.
[200:15.03]Two chops.
[200:23.07]I need a little more.
[200:25.06]Pat, pass me the salt, please.
[200:28.86]Thank you.
[200:33.66]Very good.
[200:34.38]That's a patty.
[200:36.50]Two chops coming up, two chops.
[200:39.09]Yep, yep.
[200:41.29]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[200:42.93]Behind, behind.
[200:47.73]Behind, behind.
[200:55.01]Yes, chef.
[200:56.71]Yep.
[200:58.17]I'm looking for the pork chop.
[201:00.85]Yep, okay.
[201:02.23]Behind, behind.
[201:03.27]Can I use your burner?
[201:11.24]Can I use your burner?
[201:12.04]I need to use your burner.
[201:13.86]I need to use your burner, thank you.
[201:20.56]No, it's not there, it's not there.
[201:29.44]You didn't say behind, okay?
[201:31.44]Say it when you go buy somebody.
[201:33.08]You just bumped me.
[201:34.60]I don't even know how much I put in.
[201:46.73]Alright, how much time?
[201:47.37]10 minutes.
[201:57.27]Okay, very good, very good.
[201:59.58]So far, so good.
[202:00.76]Yes, chef.
[202:02.46]Yeah, I'm currently trying to make sure that I have enough of the seasoning on here.
[202:07.18]I'm also trying to make sure that I have two, I'm looking for the wontons.
[202:14.49]Where are the wontons?
[202:16.45]Where are the, where are the wontons?
[202:20.55]Chef, where are the wontons?
[202:22.43]You closed the fridge at the beginning of this tournament.
[202:24.99]Where are the wontons?
[202:26.15]I need them for my wonton soup thing that I'm doing.
[202:29.11]Where are the wontons?
[202:34.60]Can I have, okay.
[202:39.86]You got kicked out of chef school, I didn't.
[202:43.30]They got kicked out of chef school, I didn't.
[202:46.02]Fuck them.
[202:47.62]I know I can't say squares on TV, I know, I'm sorry.
[202:49.76]I know I'm not supposed to say squares.
[202:59.45]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[203:07.14]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[203:08.02]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[203:14.11]Yeah, my risotto is gonna be in the oven in just about five minutes, chef.
[203:19.76]I've got a creamy cheddar risotto, and I also have a creamy broccoli risotto, and I also have a creamy mushroom risotto.
[203:27.88]And then pork chops, yes.
[203:35.06]I only know how to make risotto, besides that, I don't know.
[203:39.80]This is done, alright.
[203:41.46]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[203:45.49]Time.
[204:00.07]OK, yep.
[204:03.19]Chefs, what I made for you today is I have a creamy mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy chicken risotto.
[204:15.05]And then on the side of that, I also have two pork chops that I have created and I seared to perfection and then finished off in the oven.
[204:23.54]Yes, chef.
[204:23.82]Yeah.
[204:31.40]Yeah.
[204:36.22]Well, I mean, ever since I was on my own, I started to cook for myself ever since I was on my own.
[204:44.91]And I learned how to make mushroom risotto.
[204:57.39]And that's what my mom taught me.
[205:01.51]I call her every Sunday.
[205:06.05]Yes, chef.
[205:07.49]Yes, chef.
[205:17.13]Yeah, I understand.
[205:22.20]It's not good?
[205:22.76]What do you mean it's not good?
[205:26.52]It's a perfect risotto.
[205:27.94]It's perfect.
[205:30.56]It's a perfect risotto.
[205:35.90]You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[205:39.03]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[205:42.27]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows, and I'm not gonna stand for it.
[205:47.54]I'm not leaving.
[205:48.70]No, I think I deserve to win.
[206:03.09]It was a creamy mushroom risotto and you don't have a fucking pallet to save your life, you fucking idiot.
[206:10.14]I'm kidding.
[206:18.94]It's so good.
[206:20.82]It's so good.
[206:21.60]Whatever, I fuck this competition, I don't care.
[206:40.59]What do we do with this?
[206:45.45]OK.
[206:46.45]One of me winning.
[206:47.33]OK.
[206:52.85]Yes, chef.
[206:55.14]Yeah.
[206:56.70]What I have for you there is I have two seared pork chops with a side of creamy cranberry sauce.
[207:01.68]And I know that you're a big fan of chocolate, so I added some chocolate flakes on top.
[207:09.48]Yeah.
[207:19.64]Yes.
[207:23.38]I had a limited amount of time, so I wanna make sure that I got the pork chops out when the shavings went on to the risotto.
[207:30.91]And the cranberry.
[207:35.35]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[207:40.05]You've got it, you've got it, you've got it, yes!
[207:43.25]I did it, I'm, I did it, yes!
[207:46.53]Thank you, thank you so much, chef, seriously.
[207:50.73]Thank you so much, chef.
[207:52.57]And I'm gonna, when I get to the next round, you better believe I'm gonna cook my ass off.
[207:56.58]Yeah, mwah, thank you, chef.
[207:58.68]Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[208:01.98]I'm the fucking man.
[208:04.84]Huh, huh, huh, what do you got, nothing?
[208:09.53]That's me.
[208:10.37]I won.
[208:11.41]I'm going to the next round.
[208:16.16]Something about that I didn't like.
[208:17.34]Hold on a minute.
[208:19.94]Yes, chef.
[208:21.96]Yes, chef.
[208:23.66]I actually just had it before you did.
[208:24.84]I just had some before you did.
[208:26.86]I may have undercooked it a little.
[208:37.34]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[208:39.68]I think yours might be done more than mine.
[208:45.28]Yeah, mine was a little underdone.
[208:47.00]Yours will be okay though.
[208:49.38]Yes, chef.
[209:02.69]Cowboy?
[209:07.93]You should act as the chef, the critiquing chef.
[209:12.50]I don't even know how.
[209:17.72]Fight a chef in the outfit.
[209:21.28]Do the Wellington bit.
[209:22.94]I don't have the outfit.
[209:31.47]Ugh.
[209:34.76]Dodge an ax.
[209:38.82]Let me see.
[209:41.97]Please say do the stop it thing.
[209:49.79]Oh, we got time, yeah.
[209:54.69]Don't do the Wellington thing.
[209:56.13]No, I'm not doing the Wellington thing.
[210:03.77]Alright, let me, what do we got for the next costume?
[210:05.95]Here you go.
[210:07.91]So this is a showdown.
[210:08.67]You do like a duel.
[210:09.73]You take 10 steps and you draw maybe different angles.
[210:12.17]Okay.
[210:13.30]And maybe like Clint Eastwood-esque.
[210:17.06]Yeah, I'm trying to stay in the same clothing for a lot of them in a row because obviously it's easier, like someone was saying, to cut into.
[210:25.04]But there was so many requests and so many different costumes that I have to change every so often.
[210:29.59]Alright, move this.
[210:42.54]So you want to draw?
[210:43.12]Alright, partner.
[210:54.61]You tell me when.
[210:58.25]Draw.
[211:00.93]I must have lost.
[211:21.85]Should have been more careful.
[211:32.76]Ow!
[211:57.09]How about one from this side?
[212:08.76]I got my eye on you, be careful.
[212:15.94]Sit down.
[212:18.50]I'll take one from up here.
[212:23.92]Now let me tell you,
[212:27.02]You're beyond your best behavior.
[212:30.14]You're beyond your best behavior.
[212:34.83]Why don't you give me a wink when you're ready to go?
[212:38.09]Now!
[212:49.20]I just, like, shot myself.
[212:54.22]Alright.
[212:58.10]Oh, panning for gold in this pan?
[213:00.12]I think that's going to fuck up this pan.
[213:04.66]Should I wear the chef's hat for that too?
[213:08.49]I got like gold chunks.
[213:10.63]Yes, chef.
[213:11.23]Behind.
[213:23.56]Well, we'll get a new pan.
[213:31.43]Yes, chef.
[213:33.55]Yeah, I'm currently cooking a gold nugget.
[213:35.95]Probably wonder where the mustache came from and where the hat came from.
[213:39.72]I change my outfit sometimes.
[213:47.46]That's pretty good.
[213:48.20]There it is.
[213:51.54]There it is.
[213:56.06]Hear that sizzle?
[213:58.40]That's a sizzle right there.
[214:10.77]Why does the chef have a gun?
[214:17.10]OK, nod occasionally and go, yeah, yep, yeah, yep.
[214:23.30]OK, well, I want to do the yeah, yep one.
[214:37.63]Yeah.
[214:39.91]Yep.
[214:41.97]Yes, sir.
[214:44.45]Yep.

[220:15.54]No, that can't be right.
[220:22.50]This can't be right.

[223:45.28]Yeah, I took the jeans off because it's like 110 degrees.
[223:49.10]I had that gray shirt for continuity and the jeans, and I was like, I just wanted to puke.

[223:57.45]Alright, so I have the power of God in anime.
[223:59.03]So you want me to just do that?

[230:42.64]You can't use that anywhere now.
[230:44.60]Can't put that on fucking Facebook or anything.
[230:49.79]I'm here on vacation.
[230:51.09]Shut up.
[230:58.43]Alright, what's next?

[233:09.05]I don't think that's very fair.

[242:07.86]Hold on.
[242:21.31]Hello again, Steve.
[242:32.92]It's just on my fucking video.
[242:35.18]In that like college dorm room.
[242:44.05]It's just that college dorm room video.
[243:14.24]It's gonna be that college video every time.
[243:19.71]Whatever.
[243:21.09]Why would I have a tricycle this small?
[243:24.03]Why wouldn't I get one for adults?
[243:26.29]Get one for adults.
[243:28.31]Not one for children.
[243:30.28]Adults can't ride these.
[243:41.79]Hello again, Peter.
[243:44.33]It's me, Saul.
[243:47.53]You're probably wondering why you're here, what you're doing locked up down here.
[243:53.81]Well, I'll tell you.
[243:56.94]Six weeks ago, you had over 40 Pornhub tabs open at the same time, and you crashed your computer.
[244:05.10]So now you have 40 computers with 40 different porn videos on them.
[244:11.86]40 separate pornography videos.
[244:14.56]You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother finds you.
[244:23.55]You have one minute.
[244:25.47]Make your choice.
[244:42.48]Oh, by the way, Peter, forgot to mention, I know you only have 45 seconds left.
[244:48.38]The room is about to fill with gas.
[244:53.52]Nerve gas.
[244:55.86]Oh, I know nerve gas very well.
[244:57.88]I said nerve gas in Saw 1 through 5 over 200 times.
[245:04.49]You don't think I know?
[245:06.67]It's a deadly nerve agent, and it will poison your blood.
[245:13.24]Make your choice.
[245:13.92]You have 10 seconds.
[245:17.30]As the poison courses through your veins, as the gas fills your lungs, will you be able to succeed?
[245:26.65]Oh, you did it.
[245:32.75]You did it.
[245:34.23]Hey, he did it.
[245:36.85]You actually did it.
[245:37.83]Steve, what's your name again?
[245:40.77]I forget.
[245:42.50]Good job.
[245:43.14]Go through the door.
[245:45.12]Go out the door.
[245:45.80]You did it.
[245:47.44]Nice job.
[245:48.22]You actually did it.
[245:49.12]Well, did you?
[245:53.75]Outside of that door is another 50 computers with 50 Pornhub tabs open.
[246:00.13]You must.
[246:04.97]The hair is getting into my eyes.
[246:10.63]No, I don't want them to know my identity.
[246:17.60]Inside of this room, John, ten bear traps on the ground.
[246:25.92]You have three minutes to find the key to unlock the bear trap that's around your head.
[246:31.41]I put traps everywhere, so when you step around, you have to be very careful that you don't step in a bear trap.
[246:38.81]Because if you step in one of those, your leg will be severed at the knee, John.
[246:45.87]Also, the room's gonna fill with gas at the same time.
[246:51.16]Tons of gas will fill the room, gas!
[246:56.46]And you'll die with your choice.
[247:08.68]I'm not gonna twerk his jigsaw, I'm kidding.
[247:14.69]And he requests,
[247:17.29]Is the bow tie fucked up?
[247:20.31]Oh, is it?
[247:22.52]Drug?
[247:23.06]Yeah, you want to fix it?
[247:26.68]A drug PSA?
[247:50.58]Oh, my God.
[247:51.71]Alright.
[248:04.98]Hello again, Internet.
[248:09.20]It is I, Jigsaw, here to tell you that you have a choice to make.
[248:15.69]And it's time for you to make it.
[248:21.03]We're talking about drugs and how you should not do them.
[248:27.12]We all have a choice.
[248:28.90]Hi, everybody.
[248:29.34]I'm the actor that plays Jigsaw, Jeremy Elbertson.
[248:33.10]I just want to make sure that everyone's aware that if you are approached with somebody offering a drug or an alcohol, you can refuse.
[248:42.01]There's no reason to do it.
[248:44.51]So if we could all have our own jigsaws,
[248:50.51]puzzles to complete in our heads to Western Pennsylvania is the most patriotic.
[248:58.41]I'm just like finding words.
[249:00.31]I just got like stuck.
[249:16.89]Hello again, internet.
[249:19.77]Now, hello again, John.
[249:23.51]What you see before you is a choice.
[249:25.57]A very important choice.
[249:30.48]One that will live with you forever.
[249:33.40]But you can make it, and you might be able to save yourself.
[249:38.26]I'm of course talking about drugs and alcohol.
[249:41.23]Hi, everyone.
[249:42.21]My name is Sean Elbertson.
[249:44.27]I play the character Jigsaw on the daytime TV show Jigsaw Is Coming For You.
[249:50.56]I wanted to make sure I did this quick little PSA that we all have a choice to make, and that's drugs and alcohol.
[249:59.40]No reason to do them.
[250:00.94]Drugs are something, if you're ever approached and pressured, make your choice and say no.
[250:06.55]No to drugs.
[250:09.35]Thank you.
[250:17.39]Now let's get back to the show.
[250:24.95]There's a key inside of your eyeball.
[250:27.69]You need to dig it out with your bare hands and then eat it, and then shit it out.
[250:31.83]When you shit it out then, only then can you use the key to unlock the bear trap that's around John's neck.
[250:38.54]That's your choice.
[250:41.72]Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da.
[250:46.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[250:49.50]How did he get in here?
[250:52.68]How did he get in here?
[251:01.14]How did he get in here?
[251:02.74]You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[251:06.20]Ow.
[251:07.22]Ow.
[251:08.70]No.
[251:09.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[251:10.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[251:10.86]No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[251:12.52]You didn't make your choice.
[251:14.11]Your choice is to be killed.
[251:25.31]Hi, everyone.
[251:28.31]My name is Sean Elberton.
[251:29.13]I'm the actor, writer, director, producer, and main talent of the daytime television show Jigsaw Is Here.
[251:40.96]It's something very important that we all have to do.
[251:42.88]We have to make choices.
[251:44.74]And one choice is for you to watch this show.
[251:47.44]because the ratings have been very poor, and I believe that we are below reruns of infomercials at this point.
[251:55.77]So I figured we could give you a quick little, like, maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[252:00.87]For the 600 to 700 of you that do watch the show, thank you so much.
[252:06.70]It means a lot.
[252:07.64]The cast and crew, we obviously put a lot of time into this show.
[252:10.57]So we'll get back to it, though.
[252:11.55]Let's get back to your regularly scheduled programming of Jigsaw's Coming for You, written and directed, starring, and produced by me, Sean Eldredge.
[252:20.01]Okay.
[252:26.03]What is, what is it?
[252:30.95]He isn't pretending.
[252:33.93]He's playing a kid actor.
[252:38.74]Do a Family Guy ragdoll as Jigsaw.
[252:42.08]Oh my God.
[252:44.72]It's okay.
[252:44.94]Oh, you're gonna be dead.
[252:46.62]I'm gonna be dead on the ground anyways.
[252:48.04]Oh, yeah, they're having a hard time hearing you.
[252:49.56]Oh, it flipped, that's why.
[252:50.84]Oh, it flipped.
[252:51.70]Can you mute it?
[252:53.12]Oh, it should be, you know what, it's the batteries are dying.
[252:55.40]Oh shit, should we go with the other one?
[252:57.05]Oh, I think I got another minute.
[253:01.25]I still wanna do Spider-Man.
[253:03.97]This is like too much fun.
[253:05.71]Okay, here's the problem.
[253:08.39]Like, I always come to these things with so much shit.
[253:14.60]And I just, like, I have so many more things here.
[253:22.66]Don't make it the last one.
[253:26.58]It's too fun.
[253:29.21]Alright, we're gonna do some speed runs.
[253:31.77]We'll do speed runs.
[253:35.28]Alright, alright, alright.
[253:36.00]Here's the deal.
[253:36.72]I'm going to get out of Jigsaw.
[253:42.87]I can't believe I did that college video.
[253:47.21]Okay, let me get into Spider-Man and we'll do some Spider-Man stuff.
[253:54.65]Because I need to be... We've got to be out of here in...
[254:00.87]two or three hours, so it's gonna take about an hour or two to pack up.
[254:04.86]So we really only have like another 45 minutes to an hour.
[254:08.23]So let me try to speed run some stuff.
[254:11.05]We'll put on Spider-Man.
[254:11.89]I'll be right back.
[255:14.91]Let's do this real quick.
[255:26.58]No strings.
[255:30.79]Ta-da!
[255:32.73]Hey!
[255:38.49]Where'd he go?
[255:39.65]Where's the bunny?
[255:41.76]Where'd the bunny go?
[255:47.09]I don't know.
[255:49.23]Where's that rabbit?
[255:50.27]Uh oh.
[255:51.55]Jigsaw's tricycle.
[255:54.89]You know what's really funny about that though?
[255:56.89]We built that.
[255:57.87]We put the tricycle together and I actually rode it around my living room for like 10 seconds and it was fine.
[256:03.60]So of course it like blows up here.
[256:06.36]You rode it too and it was fine.
[256:10.44]I think I put way too much weight on it because I couldn't see.
[256:22.93]Oh my goodness.
[256:27.15]Yeah, put that on a birthday card.
[256:28.37]I don't care.
[256:28.73]Use it whatever you want.
[256:35.30]Oh, let me see this.
[257:05.71]What?
[257:07.79]How did I tie it in a knot?
[257:10.99]I tied it in a knot somehow.
[257:13.50]What is going on?
[257:19.28]How does this work?
[257:26.96]Oh, I get it.
[257:27.40]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[257:29.76]Okay, I get it.
[257:45.65]It keeps bunching up.
[257:47.47]It's bunching up.
[257:48.37]I don't know what to do.
[257:48.93]Is this thing still on?
[257:53.62]Can you hear me?
[257:56.74]How am I doing this wrong?
[257:58.02]I don't understand how I'm doing this wrong.
[257:59.00]I don't know.
[258:01.26]I'm doing it wrong, apparently.
[258:08.03]Is this your regular deck of cards?
[258:08.79]There's a few that just have these kind of poker guys.
[258:18.24]Alright, what do you got?
[258:21.29]There you go.
[258:23.09]Pick a card.
[258:24.03]Pick a card.
[258:24.53]Any card.
[258:24.95]I don't want to see.
[258:26.17]Pick a card.
[258:27.41]Pick a card.
[258:29.83]This one?
[258:30.63]That one right there?
[258:32.77]Take that one and stick it back in the deck right here.

[258:52.20]What was that card?
[258:53.76]That one.
[258:54.20]Right there, wasn't it?
[258:55.78]Bingo.

[259:05.88]That one?
[259:06.28]This is your card?
[259:07.42]That's your card right there?
[259:08.39]Let's get that back in the deck right here.
[259:10.27]Stuff it in there.
[259:10.79]There it is.
[259:12.45]Get a cut.
[259:13.01]Cut the deck.
[259:15.35]Cut the deck.
[259:15.85]Hold on now.
[259:16.45]I'm working on it.
[259:17.76]Cut the deck again.
[259:20.14]Cut the deck again.
[259:20.86]Spin that around.
[259:22.93]Cut the deck again.
[259:23.69]Okay.
[259:26.03]And guess what?
[259:26.55]I'll put it behind my gosh darn head.
[259:30.51]See?
[259:30.69]I don't know where it is.
[259:31.87]I have no idea.
[259:36.94]Not a clue.
[259:38.70]Not a clue.
[259:39.18]Is that the card right there?
[259:44.64]Oh, shit.
[259:46.65]It's a joker.
[259:49.89]Bingo.
[259:51.69]Here's your card.
[259:53.61]Thank you.
[259:55.52]You're right.
[259:56.30]Absolutely.
[259:57.42]Let's do this now.
[259:58.22]Ready?
[259:58.50]Check this out.
[260:08.57]Is that your card?
[260:09.73]Okay.
[260:17.59]Oh yeah, that's funny.
[260:25.19]Let's make the chair disappear.
[260:31.85]Oh, I didn't even do any lightsaber stuff.
[260:33.80]There's so much lightsaber stuff from the other couple times, you guys can figure out what to do.
[260:49.81]Alright, let's make this disappear.
[260:50.93]You wanna hold that?
[261:20.20]Watch.
[261:22.80]Watch, watch.
[261:24.88]It's gone.
[262:09.22]Thank you.
[262:10.82]Thank you.
[262:13.19]Thank you.
[262:13.81]A rose.
[262:19.41]Oh, I missed.
[262:28.51]What do I do with this?
[262:29.13]I don't get it.
[262:33.19]What is this?
[262:36.97]What do you do with this?
[262:39.35]You light it on fire?
[262:40.55]This next one's called sit down.
[262:50.20]Sit down and stop talking during the show.
[262:53.96]This next trick is called the fire rose.
[263:20.49]Thank you.
[263:22.09]Thank you very much.
[263:26.03]Don't be alarmed.
[263:26.79]Don't be alarmed.

[263:37.36]Thank you.
[263:39.12]Thank you.
[263:41.54]Yeah.
[263:43.92]Hey, what about this one?
[263:44.62]You want to see some real magic?
[263:46.02]Boom, what's that in my hand?
[263:47.04]Look at that.
[263:51.15]Catch it.
[263:52.89]There it is.
[264:00.15]It's really heavy.
[264:01.90]Who in the audience can hold it?
[264:02.98]It's a golden sphere.
[264:05.26]Right there.
[264:10.92]Who wants to see a dove?
[264:15.44]Just flew out of my jacket.
[264:22.06]That's the whole show.
[264:22.68]You ain't gonna find magic like that anywhere else.
[264:34.37]Sparks.
[264:42.18]Who wants this?
[264:44.50]Somebody wants the hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal?
[264:53.16]You mean like the, hello my baby, hello my honey?
[264:55.94]I can't kick that high.
[264:58.04]I'm gonna rip my pants.
[265:05.18]My pants are gonna rip in half.
[265:18.01]This is actually a nice suit.
[265:23.70]Hello, my baby, hello.
[265:25.10]No, that's not, I'm not going to do it.
[265:26.43]I can't do it.
[265:28.31]One more time.
[265:31.25]Can I, okay, can I dub over it?
[265:33.99]I'm going to dub.
[265:34.61]Alright, here you go.
[265:35.15]Here's the dub.
[265:36.75]Just take this audio and you can use it.
[265:40.64]Hello, my baby.
[265:41.54]Hello, my honey.
[265:42.60]Hello, my ragtime gal.

[266:40.99]Alright, let me get this off.
[266:45.57]Alright, actual clothing change.
[266:47.25]I'll be right back.
[267:45.68]What do you want with Patrick Bateman?
[267:48.32]Like dress like this?
[267:56.36]Every single day I put on a mask of apricot and pineapple gel.
[268:02.20]I smooth it into my face and make a little work.
[268:07.97]And I sell stocks and bonds.
[268:12.99]And then I chase people with a chainsaw.
[268:17.57]Your microphone's over here.
[268:23.32]Oops.
[268:24.18]Sorry.
[268:24.64]Oh, well, just use that one.
[268:26.60]Who cares?
[268:26.94]Alright, changing.
[271:56.76]Alright, guys, we've got a problem.
[272:01.40]We've got a problem.
[272:03.96]Big problem.
[272:05.87]I don't, I think this costume, I think it's two left hands.
[272:14.41]Like, can you, hold on.
[272:20.14]Am I crazy, right?
[272:23.86]I'm crazy or not, right?
[272:26.55]This is two left hands.
[272:31.79]My thumb, I can't put the thumb over there.
[272:34.64]What the fuck?
[272:39.56]Hold on, can I like... Hold on, hold on.
[273:44.40]Hey guys, I'm telling you.
[273:45.86]Oh my God, am I a good Spider-Man.
[273:49.11]Let me fucking tell you.
[273:51.73]I don't know, I can't, how am I gonna hook this thing?
[273:53.43]How am I, nobody's gonna be able to hear, okay.
[273:55.01]This is gonna be with no audio.
[273:56.75]I'm gonna have to move around in Spider-Man with no audio.
[273:58.95]I can't clip this thing to anything.
[274:00.85]I can't, can it, no way.
[274:02.97]Alright, I'm gonna, there'll be a little bit of audio.
[274:06.08]I'm gonna put the microphone like over here.
[274:10.08]Excuse me.
[274:11.82]Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.
[274:14.53]Peter Parker's here.
[274:18.84]Excuse me.
[274:19.90]Peter Parker, thank you.
[274:21.90]Peter Parker's here.
[274:23.94]Give me that fucking job.
[274:26.04]Give me that role.
[274:30.31]Alright, let me... I can't, you guys are gonna have to sit over here.
[274:37.43]You're not gonna be able to hear anything, but whatever.
[274:40.35]This is just for Spider-Man anyways, so whatever.
[274:58.65]Put it together.
[274:59.89]Does it look alright like this?
[275:02.03]Is that good?
[275:03.89]Does it look alright?
[275:16.20]Alright, so from now, now.
[275:22.95]Huh?
[275:24.83]I can't hear you.
[275:26.29]Pull it down.
[275:27.25]Can't look down?
[275:28.03]Your eyes are on your forehead.
[275:36.24]Okay.
[275:48.13]See you later, man.
[276:01.19]Green Goblin!
[276:07.15]Gotcha!
[276:14.96]But you know it's not a gotcha.
[276:18.22]Drugs and alcohol.
[276:20.48]Hi everyone, I'm Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.
[276:26.00]Can you guys even hear?
[276:36.41]Uh, you can probably just hold it right there.
[276:43.94]No.
[276:44.02]No!
[276:44.08]MJ, everyone knows I'm Spider-Man now!
[276:46.16]What am I gonna do?
[276:48.56]Don't you understand?
[276:49.26]They're gonna know my identity!
[276:50.28]Alright.
[276:51.90]We're gonna have to go underground.
[276:54.53]We're gonna have to hide for a little while.
[276:56.75]Listen to me, MJ.
[276:57.51]We gotta hide for a while.
[276:59.35]Everyone's gonna know I'm Spider-Man!
[277:06.53]MJ, come on, let's go.
[277:08.31]Look at all these people.
[277:17.45]They know I'm Spider-Man.
[277:18.81]MJ, tell them I'm a good guy.
[277:38.85]You know, what I was thinking is, what if I, what if I put a different costume on, a different suit, and I wasn't Spider-Man?
[277:46.85]What if I was a different character, and then everyone would know that it's a different superhero?
[277:51.76]Doesn't that fix everything?
[277:52.80]Can't I just put on a different costume?
[277:56.46]Well, I don't have to be Spider-Man, I can be Mothboy, and no one's gonna know it's Spider-Man, there's so many weird, fucked up people in these universes, that doesn't matter?
[278:04.75]They'll just think that, we'll just say that Spider-Man got hit by a train, and he exploded into blood and stuff, and I'm Mothboy.
[278:14.24]Doesn't that fix everything?
[278:18.25]Oh, okay, yeah, whatever, okay.
[278:19.29]That's part of the movie where everyone goes like this.
[278:21.71]Oh, yeah, whatever, okay, yeah, sure thing.
[278:35.97]Well, he already did that, moth boy.
[278:40.71]But you're marketable.
[278:42.59]You need to address the, I'm not addressing anything.
[278:47.10]Yeah, hey, address this.
[278:49.68]Nevermind.
[278:52.84]Did you hear a thing when I go, oh, everybody goes like this, everybody goes like this in the movie.
[278:55.56]Oh yeah, whatever, okay, everyone goes like this.
[278:58.34]Edit that in.
[278:58.68]Alright, let's do some more spider moves.
[279:01.46]I have to confront somebody, who am I gonna confront?
[279:12.42]Jigsaw.
[279:15.59]Hold on.
[279:16.41]Hold it.
[279:16.67]Do you want me to like kind of follow you?
[279:17.95]I'm just going to put it there.
[279:18.93]Okay.
[279:19.03]I think I can get it a little closer.
[279:53.00]I can see everything.
[279:58.61]Ow.
[280:05.41]Activate laser sight.
[280:10.65]You're not gonna get away, Green Goblin.
[280:13.09]Wait a minute.
[280:17.38]That's not Green Goblin.
[280:20.04]Who's that new man?
[280:32.42]It's supposed to be Jigsaw, and I just imagined Jigsaw flying around the room up here.
[280:38.36]And it just fucked with me.
[280:45.28]Wait a minute.
[280:46.86]Who's that?
[280:49.43]That's not the Green Goblin.
[280:51.75]That's someone else.
[280:56.93]Who's that?
[280:59.09]A new villain.
[281:08.68]You know what this is funny?
[281:09.50]This is implying that Spider-Man had 40 Pornhub tabs open.
[281:15.14]That's why Jigsaw got him.
[281:25.22]I'm gonna put the mask here.
[281:27.26]I'm gonna put the mask here, because Jigsaw got me and he put my mask away from my, because everyone knows my identity, right?
[281:35.61]So Jigsaw took my mask off.
[281:37.88]Because that ain't moving.
[281:39.72]Alright.
[281:42.24]Is there a chair I can put this on?
[281:50.66]Give me the other mask, too.
[281:53.74]Yeah, that one's fine.
[281:59.75]Yeah, that one.
[282:00.43]That's good.
[282:01.93]OK.
[282:02.59]I don't know where to put this, so I'm just going to just hold it.
[282:10.09]Oh, yeah, actually, maybe I could just set it here.
[282:15.35]Oh, my God.
[282:17.37]Alright, hold on.
[282:18.16]Hold on.
[282:20.08]I have to go this way.
[282:21.56]Everybody, don't look.
[282:22.90]Nobody look.
[282:28.18]Sitting down is like no fucking way.
[282:31.94]Oh, shit.
[282:33.36]Maybe mute.
[282:34.84]Should I mute it?
[282:35.43]Yeah, it might be loud for them.
[282:36.29]It's probably going to be loud.
[283:18.85]Where am I?
[283:21.06]What's going on here?
[283:26.26]Huh?
[283:29.28]You have an idea who you're dealing with?
[283:31.86]I'm Spider-Man.
[283:40.68]Huh?
[283:47.63]Oh shit.
[283:54.94]OK.
[283:55.88]Well, don't.
[283:57.40]Usually, I thought I cleared all that.
[283:59.80]That's fine.
[284:00.92]So what do I do?
[284:01.42]One minute?
[284:02.76]I got one minute?
[284:03.34]OK.
[284:04.72]Alright.
[284:05.52]I got one minute on the clock.
[284:06.44]I can do this.
[284:08.04]All these computers here?
[284:08.96]OK.
[284:10.56]Alright.
[284:11.30]Now?
[284:11.48]The clock is going on now?
[284:18.44]Which one?
[284:18.84]Which one do I start with first?
[284:19.66]This one over here.
[284:20.96]Got to hack into that.
[284:25.58]I hacked it, I hacked it.
[284:28.64]This one too.
[284:28.92]Okay.
[284:33.60]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, okay.
[284:35.32]Okay, there's only a few more, only a few more.
[284:41.71]Now that's thinking with webs.
[284:44.39]I did what you wanted, I shut them all off.
[284:51.61]What?
[284:53.63]I did it, I won?
[284:58.42]Okay, thanks.
[285:10.07]I can't move the mask when I'm sitting down, don't you get it?
[285:15.07]You look like an old man.
[285:16.32]Hunching, hunching over.
[285:26.86]Oh.
[285:29.12]That's so fucking stupid.
[285:33.84]I love this bizarre fucked up shit.
[285:38.52]Because everybody says there's no way it's gonna get used anywhere.
[285:43.03]But it always does.
[285:45.07]And somebody creatively uses this shit and makes an insane video.
[285:48.51]I can't fucking wait.
[285:51.75]Twerk as Spider-Man.
[285:52.81]Okay.
[285:56.01]It always works.
[285:57.81]You guys are too creative.
[286:02.79]Let me do some more stuff with Spider-Man.
[286:05.38]Just like moving around and stuff.
[286:08.98]I mean, when do I get to wear one of these?
[286:11.68]When I stand up, it's fine.
[286:13.80]You don't need audio for this.
[286:18.24]I can, that's right.
[286:32.80]Can I see the lightsaber?
[286:48.80]I feel like I'm making one of those crazy Spider-Man Elsa videos.
[287:00.25]You know what I mean?
[287:00.71]Like, oh, Spider-Man with a lightsaber is like jumping around while he eats my hamburger buns.
[287:12.93]This new technology that Tony Stark made for me sure is cool.
[287:27.34]I'm here representing the Avengers.
[287:30.28]Your eyes are on sideways.
[287:32.38]They're like...
[287:58.94]Oh, you gotta get me doing that.
[288:10.97]You gotta be like, bang!
[288:27.40]Well, this new technology that Tony Stark made sure is interesting.
[288:30.30]I wonder what I would call this.
[288:35.98]An electric sword.
[288:37.05]Yeah.
[288:38.05]I think I'm liking this.
[288:53.29]I think I like this new toy, Tony.
[288:59.21]He's dead.
[288:59.65]Oops.
[289:00.50]Never mind.
[289:01.64]Wait.
[289:03.58]Oh.
[289:03.72]I like this new toy.
[289:05.48]What do you call it?
[289:14.37]That's it.
[289:14.83]Nobody can hear me, probably.
[289:39.02]Who needs webs?
[289:43.25]You got electricity.
[289:53.19]Start to cry?
[289:59.56]Why does it look like you shit your pants?
[290:03.74]Jeremy, you're gonna drop dead.
[290:06.51]I'm alright.
[290:07.37]I'm kind of at the end here.
[290:09.85]Oh, do a superhero landing, yep.
[290:24.58]Am I late?
[290:34.73]Sorry I kept you all waiting.
[290:41.21]You gotta cut out me laughing too.
[290:43.04]It's too stupid.
[290:46.02]You know what?
[290:47.68]Can I like wrap this around?
[290:51.60]Can I wrap it around?
[290:53.99]Hold on, I have a solution.
[291:05.32]Where's the other hood?
[291:15.46]It's time to fight some crime.
[291:34.74]Made some adjustments to my suit.
[291:36.18]I feel like it's a little more appropriate.
[291:43.07]Let's go.
[292:06.00]I hope this is OK.
[292:13.32]He deserved it.
[292:14.48]Why did it explode?
[292:15.71]Hold on to that.
[292:19.19]Why did it explode?
[292:20.27]It fell four or five inches.
[292:25.19]No, I'm taller than that.
[292:26.79]Alright, I think it's like, this came, this like, I don't even know where this came from.
[292:34.77]Whatever, it's fine.
[292:39.44]Alright, what else can I do in the next 10 minutes?
[292:42.00]There's baseball, so if you can baseball Spider-Man.
[292:44.38]Baseball Spider-Man?
[292:48.02]Oh, you can order the McDermott meal.
[292:49.16]Have you done that?
[292:50.10]Oh, I kind of did with the car thing.
[292:52.21]Oh, that's right.
[293:01.33]This is so fun.
[293:02.29]I'm glad.
[293:02.69]I'm so happy to do this again.
[293:04.01]It really is so fucking fun.
[293:11.32]What do you guys think?
[293:12.14]Out of all the three times that I've done this, do you think you got enough to do some stuff?
[293:17.77]Another like 10 minutes of stuff?
[293:24.01]Because remember, you can use all footage from every single time.
[293:27.39]It's not just this one.
[293:30.51]We got this three separate streams you can pull from now.
[293:40.60]Do Patrick Bateman.
[293:45.80]Do some more dancing.
[293:52.08]You need to do more Star Wars.
[294:01.96]Virtual ASMR murder.
[294:03.64]I already did that, though.
[294:13.80]Alright, let me get a few more things out of the way.
[294:21.40]What are some more things?
[294:23.48]Honestly, you know what I'm looking forward to more than anything?
[294:26.11]Is all the Super Mario shit.
[294:28.45]I feel like, honest to God, I feel like the Mario stuff combined with a few other things could be gold.
[294:34.81]I'm just telling you.
[294:35.87]Here's a list of you in school.
[294:42.88]Alright, let me see.
[294:43.58]Yeah, there's a lot of other stuff to do.
[294:46.70]What, we think we got through like probably half the list?
[294:48.94]Maybe a little bit less than half?
[294:49.94]I don't know about half, but we got through a lot.
[294:55.54]Let's see.
[294:58.10]Yeah, there were, what, six or 700 suggestions?
[295:01.35]And this has taken down to like 200, and we did probably like 50 in five hours.
[295:09.53]Do a bong rip?
[295:10.25]Alright, I'll do a bong rip.
[295:13.12]Do the walk?
[295:13.92]Alright, I'll do the walk with Spider-Man.
[295:18.90]Oh, that's for the pointing meme, right?
[295:21.23]Yeah, I'll do the pointing meme, and I'll do the walk.
[295:24.41]And I want to do a couple more things with Spider-Man.
[295:26.31]I feel like there could be some Spider-Man stuff.
[295:30.13]Alright, you're not going to be able to hear me very well, but I'm going over here.
[295:44.71]How does it fit?
[295:52.56]I'm doing the funny thing.
[297:30.59]Alright.
[297:44.00]Go.
[297:45.30]He's going to puke.
[297:49.96]Oh, wait.
[297:51.60]No, I don't want to do it right into that.
[298:01.71]It matches.
[298:02.17]This looks fun.
[298:14.80]I don't know why I'm Spider-Man while I do that, but it's fine.
[298:29.84]The hair, do a bong rip.
[298:32.08]Alright, fine.
[298:32.68]Here's your bong rip.
[298:38.54]Do we have a bong?
[298:40.96]Yeah, I'll just pretend it's this.
[298:46.65]Here, hold this.
[299:09.86]Oh, this weed sucks.
[299:13.59]That burns so bad.
[299:41.07]He doesn't have to do the drug PSA.
[299:43.63]Oh, the drug PSA.
[299:44.97]I forgot about the drug PSA.
[299:55.50]OK, Miku.
[299:56.48]What's the Miku dance?
[300:02.42]I don't know.
[300:03.48]The death from the Thanos snap?
[300:06.66]Oh.
[300:08.04]That's sad, though.
[300:10.22]That's sad.
[300:12.62]What does he do?
[300:13.08]Alright, I'll do it quick.
[300:14.26]He's like lying down and he goes... He just says, I don't feel so good.
[300:18.19]Yeah, he goes... I don't know.
[300:31.68]Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.
[301:00.71]I'm, no, I'm still here.
[301:02.77]Whoa.
[301:05.13]Well, I'm still here.
[301:07.65]Mr. Stark, I'm, Mr. Stark, I'm still here.
[301:14.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[301:18.85]No, no.
[301:23.01]Mr. Stark, what, Mr. Stark, what is this thing?
[301:24.69]Mr. Stark, what's this little thing, Mr. Stark?
[301:27.50]Why am I holding this, Mr. Stark?
[301:30.56]There.
[301:36.32]Let me see what this is.
[301:40.10]I can't even shout the company out because it's not as focused here.
[301:49.65]Here, can you see?
[301:53.23]This is road wireless goes.
[301:55.87]These things are fucking awesome.
[301:58.99]I mean it.
[302:01.46]These things save the stream by the way.
[302:05.56]This is not sponsored, I literally bought these like hours ago.
[302:11.69]These things are fucking awesome.
[302:14.45]They're so little, they can do anything.
[302:17.73]Alright, one more thing and I'm gonna clean up.
[302:22.21]Rode, it's a Rode wireless microphones, they're fucking awesome.
[302:27.63]You get two.
[302:31.02]It's been five hours, six hours.
[302:33.00]These things are still going.
[302:33.98]This one's still going.
[302:36.68]R-O-D-E.
[302:39.30]You can plug other shit into here too.
[302:43.74]Yeah, it's still okay.
[302:45.82]Alright guys, we gotta clean up.
[302:48.45]We have a hard exit here.
[302:51.47]There's a hard stop here in like the next 40 minutes and we gotta clean up.
[302:56.83]We got through a lot.
[302:59.02]There was a lot of shit to go through today.
[303:03.32]So the next time I stream, I will give you some really clear rules, because I can't really give them to you now, because we've got to clean up.
[303:10.33]Are you going to do a day two?
[303:16.43]Probably not.
[303:26.14]Not soon.
[303:31.65]I feel like there's a lot of supplemental weird shit.
[303:35.58]Yes, you're gonna be able to use all three of the streams
[303:39.16]And on top of that, you're also, in the Discord, we'll put some rules out.
[303:45.73]We're gonna have to be, let me just say this, we're gonna have to be insanely selective this time, because there's no way we're gonna be able to get through the videos that people are gonna submit.
[303:55.04]So there's gonna be, I really hate to say this, but there's gonna be a really heavy, heavy content quality filter.
[304:03.32]Otherwise, it would just be dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of videos that we would never get through, ever.
[304:09.23]So, we're gonna have a pretty strict quality bar that is gonna have to get met.
[304:16.83]But that doesn't mean that funny, jokey, short meme stuff won't get through.
[304:21.09]It's just that we're gonna have to make a lot of hard decisions on what can actually show on stream.
[304:24.49]Because even if I do an encore night, if we do a four to hour, five hour, six hour stream, and do another six, seven hour stream encore for these videos,
[304:34.17]we probably wouldn't even get through a tenth of them.
[304:36.23]So I gotta try to get at least a quality bar that's gonna have to get passed.
[304:43.86]And it'll be in a playlist.
[304:44.78]The playlist will be available just like the last few times we've done it.
[304:50.54]Yeah, hope you guys had fun.
[304:52.72]I did.
[304:53.87]I'm very tired though.
[304:56.65]I forget how fun it is just to kind of be a wacko and do all this, so hope it was entertaining.
[305:02.57]I hope you can get some footage out of this and combine it with the other two streams.
[305:08.81]We'll see.
[305:10.24]Thank you so much for watching.
[305:11.30]I'll see you guys later.
[305:12.16]The next stream will be, what's today?
[305:16.98]Today is the 30th, okay, so.
[305:20.82]Maybe I'll be back on Sunday, Sunday the 3rd.
[305:24.90]Oh, we're going to play Cuphead.
[305:26.84]Cuphead's DLC is out.
[305:28.02]That's what I'm doing next.
[305:28.82]I'm going to stream Cuphead.
[305:29.70]We're going to beat the DLC.
[305:31.06]Maybe in one day.
[305:31.90]I'll do two or three days, however long it takes.
[305:34.08]Cuphead DLC coming soon.
[305:35.84]I'll see you guys later.
[305:38.30]Thanks for watching.
[305:39.12]Also, thanks to Holly.
[305:39.96]Holly, doing this by myself the last few years was fucking unbelievably hard.
[305:43.81]It was a lot of fun.
[305:45.49]So yeah, she did a lot of help here.
[305:47.99]Just helping with props and costumes and compiling stuff.
[305:50.67]So that was a big help.
[305:52.29]So it was a lot of fun.
[305:54.22]Yeah.
[305:55.46]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[305:57.82]Good night.
[305:58.74]Goodbye.
[306:00.15]Take care, guys.
[306:01.03]Call your mother.
[306:01.85]You know the deal.
[306:03.25]See you later.
