[00:11.48]Hey, uh, have you lost something?
[00:13.68]I'm just fishing.
[00:14.64]Where the sacred fish legend has it, if it gets on your line, it takes you to seek treasure.
[00:20.00]I am the sacred fish of Salty Swamp.
[00:22.74]Put the gun down, you crazy Samaritan!
[00:24.68]This is a big loss for us.
[00:26.03]Did you find it?
[00:27.15]Great news.
[00:49.92]Put the child down, you crazy Samaritan, or I will shoot you!
[00:54.88]Your bullets can't affect me.
[00:57.55]My skin is made out of... And that's how I saved the village.
[01:09.15]And how I became a cop.
[01:10.87]Thinkin' me and Tron will go check it out.
[01:13.32]We don't know where it is!
[01:16.28]It's actually, you know, it's actually, it's just west of Salty Swamp.
[01:20.36]Okay.
[01:23.24]It's a sacred place now, so you can't even get in there without doing something highly secretive.
[01:26.99]We're definitely gonna need some backup.
[01:29.11]Chill out, everybody calm down and leave it to me.
[02:01.27]Look at me, everybody.
[02:03.09]I'm a really hungry piggy.
[02:06.95]Okay, sometimes I think the whole overly dumb character shouldn't even exist.
[02:11.57]Agreed.
[02:12.49]So, have you found anything interesting about this fish?
[02:16.13]Nope, but I guess those two crocs are working with the police now.
[02:20.96]Something about taking... You're not going to eat his mashed potatoes, right?
[02:24.28]No.
[02:24.92]What about drinking that Fungi Froth milkshake?
[02:28.24]Thick shake fucking shit.
[02:29.96]I'm allergic to that stuff.
[02:31.30]Excellent!
[02:32.44]And, uh, boss, I also heard they were taking a trip to the sacred village.
[02:37.58]What?!
[02:38.54]Tastes kinda yummy.
[02:39.88]Oh my god, you look so stupid!
[02:43.00]Really, look in the mirror, it's disgusting me!
[02:45.66]Clean up on aisle three!
[02:49.25]I sincerely hope you die right now.
[02:53.19]Come here, fish!
[02:54.63]I got a cake, come on!
[02:56.37]I baked a birthday cake for you!
[02:58.58]I don't know how old you are, but there's 55 candles on the cake.
[03:02.60]What in the fuck?
[03:03.92]How did he know my birthday?
[03:04.96]Come on, fishy.
[03:05.92]I know you're out there.
[03:08.10]No one's ever given me birthday cake before.
[03:09.74]That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done.
[03:12.64]I really don't think I'll ever catch this fish.
[03:15.54]I should really give the boys a call.
[03:17.16]Give me my birthday cake!
[03:19.00]Hey!
[03:19.71]Hey!
[03:20.23]Hey!
[03:27.25]I've been out here all day and still no luck at all.
[03:30.67]Don't give up, Professor.
[03:32.23]Dron and I are tagging along with the cops, trying to find a sacred village.
[03:36.89]Although we think Sarge is just making it up.
[03:39.35]Okay, well, be safe, boys.
[03:42.07]I don't want you getting into any trouble.
[03:45.23]Come on, fishy, come on, where are you?
[04:02.85]Well, we found a huge door.
[04:05.23]This must be it.
[04:06.27]Okay, so how do we get in?
[04:08.74]Let us in, please.
[04:10.92]All those who wish to enter the Wushu Laundry Village must present the all-powerful sacred password.
[04:16.68]Why don't we have ourselves a guest first?
[04:21.64]Hold on.
[04:22.34]Let me handle this one, boys.
[04:23.76]I'm a cop.
[04:24.40]I do these things for a living.
[04:27.38]What was that?
[04:29.46]You heard me.
[04:30.18]I said the X was working out with me.
[04:32.30]Let me tell you this, motherfucker.
[04:33.80]If you do not give me that password right now, we're gonna have a problem.
[04:37.82]God, I must have changed the password.
[04:39.79]I don't get paid enough to do this shit.
[04:41.65]It makes perfect sense.
[04:42.93]In an age when you can get your identity stolen... The password is Jambalawa.
[04:48.53]Jambalawanhee.
[04:50.09]Jambalawa.
[04:51.35]Jambalawanhee.
[04:52.73]Close enough.
[04:53.53]You may enter.
[04:55.33]Oh, God.
[04:58.01]Hey, guys.
[04:59.27]Dude, he's totally fluking this.
[05:59.26]moving through with some friends of mine.
[06:00.68]We're going to go see my place.
[06:02.82]Yeah, okay.
