[00:08.56]hey what is going on everybody Jerma here with the man versus machine update for Team Fortress 2. now playing as the medic on the screen I'm going to get into some live commentary here in just a minute but I do want to explain this mode because a lot of people still haven't been able to play this yet and I know that when last night with this came out it was very difficult to even get into a server and we actually had to join a private match
[00:32.27]to even play the game.
[00:33.91]So I do feel your pain if you were trying to play last night, because we all were trying to play, and it was just pure chaos.
[00:39.78]Hopefully today the servers are a little bit better, and that's... I'm assuming they will be.
[00:44.95]So anyways, let's talk about the mode and what I think about it, and how much fun it is, and all that jazz.
[00:50.49]So first of all, guys, this is incredibly fun.
[00:54.49]If you can get like 3, 4, 5, 6 of your friends, well, 5 of your friends actually, because it's 6 total, into a game, and get on Skype or get on Mumble or something, you are going to have some of the most fun you could ever have when you load up Team Fortress 2.
[01:08.80]Now that's a very bold statement, I know it is, but remember, this game...
[01:12.46]This game is quite old now, guys, and I'm happy to see that Valve is starting to try some really, really drastically new ideas.
[01:20.38]And this is definitely a drastically new thing to Team Fortress, a wave, co-op, defense, tower defense mode.
[01:27.41]So it's very exciting, and what's also really exciting is modders, the future development of this game mode.
[01:33.09]This could go in so many different directions, guys, and I just am giddy.
[01:36.51]I can't wait to see what's gonna happen with all this.
[01:39.45]So let's talk about the mode now.
[01:41.03]The very general basics of this game mode is kill robots, pick up money, upgrade your character.
[01:48.46]That is the pretty much gist of the entire mode, but here's the real kicker, and this is something that I didn't know when I first started playing.
[01:56.61]Every single item in this game, whether that be an unlockable, whether that be a stock item, everything has its own upgrade tree.
[02:05.93]And I'm pretty certain on this that all the weapons fall into a certain template for upgrades.
[02:11.08]So let's say you have a pistol versus a madmilk or a jarate.
[02:14.66]The madmilk and the jarate will have the same available upgrades rather than the pistol.
[02:20.22]So the amount of builds you can make are pretty much through the roof, especially because there's a character tree as well, which does things like run speed, jump height, bullet damage resistance, fire damage resistance, there's a lot to this.
[02:34.28]I am pleasantly surprised by this, guys, and although we did not get any new weapons, all of the things you can unlock in this game mode with the Tour of Duty tickets, they are all cosmetic.
[02:44.79]So, we didn't get any new weapons, but still, it's an awesome update, and I'm sure they're working on stuff right now anyways, guys, because they're always working on stuff.
[02:52.12]But I'm gonna let the live commentary kick in now, guys.
[02:54.46]Playing with guys like Shibby, Boo, Etalyx, MLC_St3alth, and John.
[02:58.72]So, enjoy the live commentary playing as the medic, and go have fun with the update, everybody.
[03:03.42]And I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
[03:09.87]He's just up there taunting!
[03:12.45]Get over here, yeah.
[03:15.03]I see, I see.
[03:15.49]What a jerk.
[03:18.51]I'm down.
[03:20.65]Catch you, Etalyx.
[03:23.01]Yeah, they're flooding left side.
[03:24.21]I'm just gonna use crits and just kill them.
[03:30.72]Until you guys respawn.
[03:32.22]You need more damage.
[03:33.80]I'm coming behind you.
[03:34.88]I got you, Etalyx.
[03:35.68]Come here.
[03:37.00]Oh, yeah.
[03:38.16]Got them heals.
[03:42.57]Yeah, you should always, Etalyx, before you charge in to grab some money, just come back to me.
[03:47.41]I'll make sure to get you an overheal.
[03:48.57]Alright, sweet.
[03:51.01]Oh, wow.
[03:53.23]Oh my god, this guy with the bomb.

[04:08.14]Oh god!
[04:08.76]Just do it!
[04:10.22]Smash people.
[04:13.70]Oh, they snuck down the stairs with the bomb.
[04:15.56]Oh, fall down.
[04:16.88]Shit, there's more, there's more, there's more.
[04:20.20]Oh my god.
[04:24.17]Heavy is dead!
[04:25.19]I just screamed that.
[04:26.37]Heavy is dead!
[04:29.59]I'm getting all of them!
[04:31.13]Wow, this is actually going pretty well.
[04:36.73]Still alive.
[04:37.49]Wonder if I can get, like, attack speed with the Persian Persuader.
[04:41.48]I don't know.
[04:43.76]That would be amazing.
[04:49.40]Last one alive.
[04:50.46]Lock that aura.
[04:56.43]oh geez man come here heels I gotta get the next thing I'm getting is it is healed right definitely alright we're almost done with wave two they're just coming across the bridges they're coming on the right side they're all sneaking across the right side it's alright we got a crit here oh there was one sneaky scout that almost got in there but I killed him
[05:27.32]Heals.
[05:28.22]Heals.
[05:29.18]There we go.
[05:29.60]Nice Mini-Sentries, there we go.
[05:31.02]There we go.
[05:33.38]Excellent.
[05:36.52]Wow, wow, I just got hit from a little spittle.
[05:39.90]I need health.
[05:40.68]Where is he?
[05:41.24]Where are they?
[05:42.02]They're all up there.
[05:43.46]I took out the soldiers.
[05:45.14]I gotta, I'm sorry, I'm not healing.
[05:46.70]I just gotta grab health or I'm gonna lose this uber.
[05:49.80]They're all coming across the bridge.
[05:51.44]Alright.
[05:53.72]Oh, shivvy.
[05:54.28]Ah.
[05:59.79]Alright, John.
[06:00.71]Here we go.
[06:01.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[06:02.23]Here they come.
[06:02.59]Right bridge.
[06:03.01]Right bridge.
[06:05.63]Got him.
[06:06.13]There it is.
[06:07.41]Oni, Oni, Oni.
[06:07.81]Turn around.
[06:08.09]Turn around.
[06:11.29]I was just like, yeah.
[06:12.49]Money.
[06:13.29]See ya.
[06:13.77]We're not doing so hot on the money collecting.
[06:19.49]Back when Boo was a scout, he was just running in there.
[06:22.91]So scouts are actually very, very, very useful when it comes to money.
[06:27.21]Particularly good with bunk if you want to get all the cash.
[06:31.55]You don't want to run behind super pyros.
[06:34.88]I'm not going to use it right away.
[06:38.64]I'm going to wait until we get the heavies to drop down because those are scarier.
[06:44.93]So now... Oh yeah, now we're talking.
[06:46.75]Yeah, Etalyx.
[06:49.03]I'm going to do it when these guys drop.
[06:53.61]Right now.
[06:54.43]Yeah, right now.
[06:56.95]And I fell off, but it's okay.
[06:58.65]This guy's just trying to swing at me.
[07:05.27]Get the money.
[07:05.77]Somebody get the money.
[07:06.67]I'll get it.
[07:08.69]Oh, I sacrificed myself for the money.
[07:10.29]No, Spy's jamming.
[07:14.46]No, Dee's not still alive.
[07:16.68]Oh, I was clear.
[07:17.72]I couldn't get it on you.
[07:18.66]I'm going to die too.
[07:19.22]Spy is me.
[07:20.60]Spy is me.
[07:23.09]I was clicking on you.
[07:23.71]I don't know.
[07:24.51]I think what was happening was I was running into the bots.
[07:26.97]Like I was hitting the bots with the beam.
[07:28.30]They were blocking you.
[07:29.84]Oh my gosh.
[07:30.48]Heavy weapons guy.
[07:32.00]I'm falling back.
[07:33.14]Give me a stealth.
[07:38.74]Taking out the heavy weapons.
[07:39.86]The scouts are getting by.
[07:42.16]Get rid of that.
[07:44.14]Let me get down there and get the money.
[07:45.45]So much money.
[07:46.93]Oh crap.
[07:48.21]The scouts are coming up.
[07:52.61]Ow, ow.
[07:53.25]This guy's got the bomb.
[07:59.39]Spies sapping sentries up there.
[08:00.79]We're not going to be able to get all the money.
[08:05.25]Crap.
[08:05.69]No, stay alive.
[08:06.43]There's a bomb.
[08:08.69]I fell down on him.
[08:10.11]Oh, they've got the bomb.
[08:11.69]Oh, God.
[08:13.13]I got it.
[08:18.59]Nice.
[08:22.01]Did you see how fast this SMG shoots?
[08:25.43]Hacks.
[08:26.39]I'm just gonna use it.
[08:29.59]Just get rid of these guys so we can get our bearings.
[08:32.21]It's fine.
[08:32.95]Two left.
[08:33.33]Two scouts left.
[08:34.09]Nice.
[08:35.35]Excellent.
[08:36.29]No!
[08:36.71]Get rid of stealth!
[08:43.36]So many scouts!
[08:45.30]Yeah, there really is so many.
[08:46.40]I can only wrangler with one sentry at a time.
[08:49.74]There's so many scouts.
[08:54.37]Bye, boo, no.
[08:57.11]Give her Etalyx.
[08:58.11]Hey, heals!
[09:00.41]There it is.
[09:02.22]Get the money.
[09:03.24]I don't see any money.
[09:06.84]Sorry, we did alright.
[09:09.32]Oh boy.
[09:10.94]Let me get this heal right even further.
[09:12.93]So we have one huge heavy with scout support.
[09:17.04]You know what, you guys can all just get over it because I readied first this round.
[09:22.06]Alright, this ubercharge raid is going to be ridiculous.
[09:26.96]After I get this heal raid.
[09:28.54]Oh, max overheal.
[09:29.82]Oh, I don't know what to do.
[09:30.76]It's so much cool options.
[09:34.42]Uh, they're spawning on the left side.
[09:36.37]Oh.
[09:36.77]Oh wow!
[09:37.29]There's a whole bunch of them right up here.
[09:38.69]Oh my god.
[09:39.29]Oh my god!
[09:40.59]Oh my god.
[09:41.11]I think we should start on the back, start on the back, start on the back.
[09:44.57]I'm gonna... Oh, I gotta get that money up there.
[09:47.25]That just startled the crap out of me.
[09:48.75]I had to, I just used it.
[09:51.07]Oh, John, you're gonna get overwhelmed here.
[09:52.57]I'm gonna get the money.
[09:54.29]Where'd they go?
[09:56.58]I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
[09:59.92]I'm getting the money.
[10:03.58]I'm crushing as many as I can before they get through.
[10:16.87]Oh Hey boys, oh We gotta get that money Here they come I need ammo
[10:31.17]I got a dispenser up here.
[10:32.13]I'm on it.
[10:32.79]Alright, I gotta bounce.
[10:33.59]I gotta get ammo.
[10:34.17]Alright, get it.
[10:34.87]I got it.
[10:35.15]I got it.
[10:35.67]No, that's cool.
[10:36.35]I got it.
[10:36.69]I got it.
[10:37.29]That's cool.
[10:38.77]Everyone's out of ammo.
[10:44.14]I have a hack and slash machine.
[10:46.94]Jeez.
[10:51.94]Oh, we gotta get this money that's over here.
[10:53.52]They're up here.
[10:54.52]I'm going to get the money at the beginning.
[10:57.04]Got it.
[11:00.35]Oh, so many.
[11:01.19]They're shooting so fast.
[11:03.87]Oh, come here.
[11:04.59]No, get the money.
[11:07.15]Oh, sniper taking my sentry guns.
[11:10.85]Oh, ow.
[11:17.70]Stay alive.
[11:20.74]I've got bullet resistance, so I'm doing pretty good against the scouts.
[11:25.85]And I can one-shot them now.
[11:28.41]With just the swing?
[11:29.67]Yep.
[11:30.97]That's a pretty beast.
[11:32.69]Smoke them.
[11:33.15]The hard part is hitting them because it's so fast.
[11:36.84]Oh my god.
[11:38.36]That's so ridiculous.
[11:39.72]Are you shooting like six or something?
[11:43.50]Behind us.
[11:44.32]I'm shooting like at 100 miles per hour.
[11:45.28]The Mini-Sentry just destroys everything.
[11:48.53]That's a lot of money.
[11:49.47]Oh, 12.
[11:50.13]How many can you have?
[11:50.71]Two or three?
[11:52.69]I'll get that last bunny right next to your boot.
[11:54.57]Oh, I got it.
[11:55.92]Oh, sorry.
[11:59.04]Money.
[11:59.30]No, it's with the Widowmaker.
[12:01.32]I have my ammo count at 600, and then I'm getting ammo on hits, which they penetrate.
[12:06.68]I can just keep shooting forever.
[12:08.82]Jeez.
[12:09.58]Insane.
[12:09.94]That's insane.
[12:13.08]Alright, let's see what I want to do here.
[12:15.32]Definitely this.
[12:18.32]Who's coming next?
[12:19.12]Scouts, medics, super tank.
[12:22.01]Yeah, I'm definitely doing a refill clip and ammo.
[12:24.93]Oh wow, that's a lot of scouts.
[12:26.63]Hey, buds.
[12:28.95]Oh my god.
[12:31.19]Get that money.
[12:32.05]Get that money.
[12:33.72]Oh, stall!
[12:35.64]A super heavy came down here.
[12:37.04]He's not taking damage.
[12:38.90]Yeah, he's over it.
[12:39.94]Yeah, they came down here.
[12:41.94]I'm gonna take out the medic.
[12:44.02]Jeez Louise.
[12:44.74]Okay, medic's down.
[12:46.47]Oh my god.
[12:49.27]Oh my goodness.
[12:50.17]Got him.
[12:53.27]Oh, soldier scout.
[12:55.21]Scout's got behind.
[12:58.05]A couple of them.
[13:00.77]Heals, please.
[13:02.31]Where are you?
[13:03.31]Oh, no.
[13:06.82]Oh, my God.
[13:08.08]He killed me, too.
[13:11.14]He's carrying the bomb.
[13:12.46]Scout's in spawn.
[13:13.48]Doing work on him.
[13:19.10]Got him.
[13:19.60]Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[13:22.43]Oh god.
[13:24.63]Oh my god, just body block.
[13:28.03]Now there's a tank, right?
[13:29.07]Tank's the last thing?
[13:30.17]Oh shit, yeah.
[13:31.83]That's it, that's it.
[13:32.83]Stop that tank!
[13:42.80]I'm gonna give you the crits.
[13:43.54]I'm gonna do so much damage.
[13:44.62]I'm gonna give you the crits.
[13:46.44]I'm doing a hundred per hit.
[13:48.50]And let's see how much damage you do now, and...
[13:52.71]Oh, that's nuking it.
[13:54.03]Wow.
[13:55.05]Insane.
[13:57.97]Yeah, each of my swings was doing a hundred damage.
[14:01.54]We got an F. There were so many scouts.
[14:06.22]I'm a man.
