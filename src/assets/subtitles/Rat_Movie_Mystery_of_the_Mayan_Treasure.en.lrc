[00:11.68]We're the rats.
[00:14.26]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[00:18.73]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[00:24.78]So sue me for being thorough.
[00:26.54]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[00:28.92]Look, seriously, mate.
[00:30.70]How many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[00:34.43]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[00:36.61]We've got to get the treasure, we've got to get out of there, and we also have to... And we must get it.
